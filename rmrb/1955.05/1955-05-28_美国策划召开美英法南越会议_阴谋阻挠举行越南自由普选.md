　　Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, May 25th: The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government, under the direction of the United States, has suggested that the United States, France, Britain, and South Vietnam unilaterally hold a "four-nation conference" in Saigon to discuss the so-called Vietnam issue.
　　According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 23rd, the French Foreign Ministry has agreed to hold this meeting. On the 24th, a British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain had accepted the invitation to participate in the meeting and had instructed the British Ambassador to Saigon, Stephenson, to participate in the discussions.
　　Regarding the purpose of this meeting, Ngo Dinh Diem's spokesman evasively stated that the meeting would study the entire aspect of the major issues arising from last year's Geneva Conference. According to an Associated Press report, the Ngo Dinh Diem government hopes to reach an "agreement" on issues such as the free general elections in Vietnam decided by the Geneva Conference. As everyone knows, the Geneva Accords expressly stipulate that free general elections should be held in July 1956 to achieve the unification of Vietnam. To this end, the responsible authorities in the southern and northern regions of Vietnam should consult on this issue starting in July 1955. After the concentration of armed forces on both sides is completed, this is precisely the issue that should be strictly implemented by all parties concerned. The United States, France, Britain, and South Vietnam discussing this issue behind the backs of other participating countries of the Geneva Conference is clearly not in accordance with the Geneva Accords.
　　From the news revealed by foreign news agencies, it can be seen that the United States is instigating this unilateral four-nation conference in order to undermine the political provisions of the Geneva Accords and obstruct the holding of the free general elections in Vietnam stipulated in the agreement.
　　The news indicates that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also intend to continue to force France to make concessions in South Vietnam through this meeting. A United Press International Saigon dispatch pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem believes he has already "defeated" France, and he intends to further "revise" the agreement reached between the United States and France in Paris through the Saigon conference, demanding that the West "firmly support his government."

### 美国策划召开美英法南越会议  阴谋阻挠举行越南自由普选

　　美国策划召开美英法南越会议
　  阴谋阻挠举行越南自由普选
    新华社二十五日讯　西贡消息：南越吴庭艳政府在美国的指使下，已经建议由美国、法国、英国和南越片面地在西贡举行“四国会议”，来讨论所谓越南问题。
    据美联社二十三日消息说，法国外交部已经同意举行这次会议。二十四日，英国外交部发言人表示，英国已经接受参加会议的邀请，并且已经指令英国驻西贡大使斯蒂芬逊参加会商。
    关于这次会议的目的，吴庭艳的发言人闪烁其词地说，会议将要研究去年日内瓦会议所引起的主要问题的整个方面。据美联社消息指出，吴庭艳政府是希望就日内瓦会议所决定的越南自由普选等问题，达成“协议”。大家知道，日内瓦协定明文规定在一九五六年七月内举行自由普选以实现越南的统一，为此，南越和北越双方地区的负责当局应从一九五五年七月起就这个问题进行协商。在双方武装部队集结完毕之后，这正是应由有关各方严格履行的问题。美国、法国、英国、南越背着日内瓦会议的其他参与国来讨论这个问题，显然是不符合日内瓦协定的。
    从外国通讯社透露的消息可以看出，美国策动这次片面的四国会议，目的就在于准备破坏日内瓦协定的政治条款，阻挠这个协定所规定的越南自由普选的举行。
    消息说明，美国和吴庭艳集团也打算通过这次会议继续逼迫法国在南越让步。合众社西贡消息指出，吴庭艳认为他自己已经“击败了”法国，他打算通过西贡会议，进一步“修改”美、法在巴黎达成的协议，要西方“坚决地支持他的政府”。
