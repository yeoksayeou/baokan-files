Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd dispatch: The spring production and disaster relief work in areas affected by floods last year has achieved remarkable success. Currently, early-maturing crops in many areas are already budding or about to bud. In the Huaibei area of Anhui Province, broad beans and peas began to be harvested in mid-May. In disaster areas such as Jiangxi and Henan provinces, barley began to be harvested in mid-May, and other disaster areas are not far from the summer harvest season.

　　In order to ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing and production in flood-stricken areas, local party and government leading organs at all levels have taken various measures. Hubei Province not only transferred 50,000 head of draught cattle from various parts of the province and elsewhere to support the heavily flooded areas, but also transferred more than 143.3 million jin of seeds from non-disaster areas to solve the difficulties of disaster victims lacking seeds. Hunan Province transferred more than 16,400 head of draught cattle and more than 33.12 million jin of rice seeds. The Shangrao and Jiujiang special districts of Jiangxi Province, as well as Nanchang, Xinjian, and Jinxian counties, also adjusted and purchased more than 18,000 head of draught cattle for the disaster areas.

　　In order to enable disaster victims to have an early harvest and shorten the disaster period, all localities have also paid attention to mobilizing the masses to plant a large number of early-maturing crops and melons and vegetables on the premise of not delaying the sowing of autumn harvest crops. According to statistics from only some areas of Anhui, Hebei, Hunan and other provinces, more than 2.7 million mu of early-maturing crops have been sown. According to statistics from eight lakeside counties in Changde Special District, Hunan, the planned planting area of ​​early-maturing crops reached more than 113,000 mu, an expansion of more than eight times compared with the same period last year.

　　Various localities have also vigorously developed sideline production, which has solved the immediate food shortage difficulties of disaster victims and supported spring plowing and production in disaster areas. The sideline production in the disaster areas of Hebei and Henan provinces has been the most extensive, with the active guidance and assistance of government economic departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. According to statistics as of early March, disaster victims in Hebei Province had already gained 98.81 million yuan in sideline production. Disaster victims in Henan Province have gained a total of more than 450 million jin of grain.

　　During this period, all localities allocated a batch of relief funds and loans to help disaster victims solve their production and living difficulties. According to statistics from six provinces including Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Hebei, the relief funds distributed this spring reached 83.45 million yuan. According to statistics from six special districts in Hebei Province—Tianjin, Baoding, Cangxian, Tongxian, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtai—as of the end of April, the relief funds distributed to disaster victims totaled more than 10.9933 million yuan, and loans totaled 15.35 million yuan. Since the beginning of spring, Jiangxi Province has distributed a total of 9.3688 million yuan in relief funds and 11.34 million yuan in loans.

　　At present, there are still some areas with no summer harvest crops or very few summer harvest crops. The lives of the masses in these areas still face many difficulties in the summer. Therefore, in mid-May, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the “Instructions on Paying Attention to Doing a Good Job in Summer Famine Relief Work,” requiring all localities to make persistent efforts and continue to do a good job on the basis of existing achievements.

　　去年遭受水灾地区
　　春季生产救灾获得显著成绩
    据新华社二十二日讯　去年遭受水灾地区的春季生产和救灾工作取得了显著成绩。目前，许多地区的早熟作物已经接口或快要接口。安徽省淮北地区的蚕豆、豌豆五月中旬就已开始收割。江西、河南等省灾区五月中旬已开始收割大麦，其他灾区也距夏收期间不远。
    为了保证水灾地区春耕生产的顺利进行，当地各级党政领导机关采取了各种措施。湖北省不仅从省内外各地调运了五万头耕牛支援大水地区，同时从非灾区调运了种籽一亿四千三百余万斤，解决灾民缺乏种籽的困难。湖南省调运了一万六千四百余头耕牛和稻谷种籽三千三百一十二万余斤。江西省上饶、九江两专区以及南昌、新建、进贤三个县亦为灾区调剂和购买了耕牛一万八千余头。
    为了使灾民早日接口、缩短灾期，各地并注意发动群众在不误秋收作物播种的条件下，大量种植早熟作物和瓜菜。仅安徽、河北、湖南等省的部分地区统计，即已播种了早熟作物二百七十余万亩。湖南常德专区滨湖八个县统计，计划种植早熟作物达十一万三千多亩，比去年同期播种面积扩大八倍多。
    各地还大力开展了副业生产，这样解决了灾民眼前的口粮困难并支持了灾区的春耕生产。河北、河南两省的灾区副业生产，在政府经济部门和供销合作社的积极指导和帮助下，开展得最为广泛。截至三月上旬统计，河北省灾民在副业生产中即已获利九千八百八十一万元。河南省灾民共获利四亿五千多万斤粮食。
    各地在这一期间都投放了一批救济款和贷款，帮助灾民解决生产和生活的困难。安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西、河北等六省统计，今春发放的救济款达八千三百四十五万元。河北省天津、保定、沧县、通县、石家庄、邢台六个专区截至四月底统计，共发到灾民手中的救济款达一千零九十九万三千余元，贷款一千五百三十五万元。江西省入春后共发放了救济款九百三十六万八千元，贷款一千一百三十四万元。
    现在，还有些地区无夏收作物或夏收作物很少，这些地区群众夏季的生活仍存在不少困难，因此，中华人民共和国内务部在五月中旬就发出了
  “注意做好夏荒救济工作的指示”，要求各地再接再厉在现有成绩的基础上，继续做好这一工作。
