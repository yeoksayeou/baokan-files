    Deeply Understand the Thoughts and Emotions of Cooperative Members
    Zhong Xia
    In the work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, some comrades are unwilling to deeply understand the thoughts and emotions of cooperative members. They do not earnestly analyze and solve problems, but simply "go through the motions," believing that they have completed a general rectification and that there are no major problems. However, the reality is often not as simple as they imagine.
    The seven agricultural cooperatives, including Jingxing, Yixin, and Jinxing in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, were among the first batch of new cooperatives established in the county last winter. They have a good foundation and strong backbone, and are basically consolidated. However, judging from some of the issues reflected in a recent small-scale symposium held by the Rural Work Department of the CPC Jingjiang Prefectural Committee and the cadres of these seven cooperatives, there are still many noteworthy problems in these cooperatives.
    The middle peasants in these agricultural cooperatives have varying degrees of wavering and resistance. The more affluent among the middle peasants have deeper wavering and resistance. They mostly joined the cooperative because they saw the "general trend" and were forced to join. They are passive in production, unwilling to invest, and constantly spread their wavering and dissatisfaction to outside the agricultural cooperative. They are "people in the cooperative, but their hearts are outside," and they do not care about anything in the agricultural cooperative. Jingxing Agricultural Cooperative lacked seeds, and cooperative member (middle peasant) Huang Mingyuan would rather grind the seeds to feed the pigs than lend them to his own agricultural cooperative. Although these people have very serious resistance ideas, they dare not withdraw from the cooperative for fear of being politically "isolated" and "besieged" during unified purchase. Therefore, they secretly hope that the agricultural cooperative will collapse and often spread dissatisfaction.
    General middle peasant cooperative members are most uneasy about two things: first, they are afraid that the agricultural cooperative will not be able to increase production; second, they are afraid that the agricultural cooperative will not implement mutually beneficial policies and will "exploit" them to take care of the poor peasants. Some middle peasant cooperative members said: "We are just afraid of being asked to 'carry' the poor households to socialism." Some poor peasants in the agricultural cooperative feel that they cannot straighten their backs. Whatever the agricultural cooperative does, it must first look at the faces of the middle peasants, but the middle peasants still feel that they have suffered a loss. In addition to these problems, middle peasant cooperative members are also worried that the agricultural cooperative will take the lead too much in grain unified purchase work, and worried that the policies will change in the future. Long Shunxiang, a middle peasant cooperative member of Yixin Agricultural Cooperative, quietly asked a cooperative affairs committee member (Communist Party member): "How will things be done in the future?"
    The unstable mood of middle peasants and the uncoordinated relationship between middle and poor peasants have already affected the unity and production of agricultural cooperatives. It is understood that nearly half of the land in these seven agricultural cooperatives has no fertilizer.
    The cooperative cadres generally have complacency and complacency about these problems. They thought that all the work had been done, the cooperative charter had been drawn up, so what problems could there be? When the higher authorities proposed to re-launch ideological mobilization, Hu Xinan, a cooperative affairs committee member of the newly established agricultural cooperative, said: "The cooperative charter has already been drawn up, what else is there to mobilize?"
    These basically consolidated agricultural cooperatives all have these problems, so it is conceivable what the general agricultural cooperatives are like. Complacency and complacency are wrong; formalistically "rectifying" the agricultural cooperative will not have any effect. We should truly go deep into the masses, fully understand the real thoughts of the cooperative members, strictly implement the policies of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and carry out meticulous rectification work to truly consolidate the agricultural cooperatives that can be consolidated.

    深入了解社员的思想情绪
　　仲夏
    在整顿、巩固农业生产合作社的工作中，有一些同志不愿意深入了解社员的思想情绪，不去认真地分析和解决问题，只简单地“走走过场”，便认为已经普遍整顿一遍，没有大问题了。但事实往往并不像他们所想像的那样简单。
    湖北江陵县荆星、一心、金星等七个农业社，是该县去年冬季第一批建立的新社。它们的基础好，骨干强，基本上是巩固的。但从最近中共荆江地委农村工作部和这七个社的干部举行的小型座谈会上所反映的一些问题来看，这些社里仍然存在着不少值得注意的问题。
    这些农业社里的中农存在着程度不等的动摇和抵触情绪。中农中的较富裕者，动摇抵触情绪更深。他们多是看到“大势所趋”，被迫入社的。他们生产消极，不肯投资，并不断把动摇、不满的情绪传播到农业社外去。他们是“人在社，心在外”，对农业社的一切都不关心。荆星农业社缺少种籽，社员（中农）黄明元宁愿把种籽碾给猪吃，也不肯借给自己的农业社。这些人虽然有很严重的抵触思想，但是不敢退社，怕政治上被“孤立”，统购时受“围攻”。于是，他们就暗地里盼望农业社垮台，经常散布不满情绪。
    一般的中农社员，最不放心的有两件事：一、害怕农业社不能增产；二、害怕农业社不实行互利政策，“揩”他们的油照顾贫农。有些中农社员说：“就怕叫我们‘背’着贫户到社会主义”。有些贫农在农业社里，觉得直不起腰来。农业社办什么事，首先要看中农的脸，而中农还觉得自己吃了亏。除了这些问题以外，中农社员还耽心农业社在粮食统购工作中过分带头，耽心以后政策要变化。一心农业社中农社员龙顺祥悄悄问一个社务委员（共产党员）：“以后究竟怎样个搞法？”
    中农情绪不稳，中贫农关系不协调，已经影响到农业社的团结生产。据了解，这七个农业社近半数土地的肥料都没有着落。
    社干部对这些问题普遍存在麻痹自满情绪。他们以为，各项工作都做了，社章也订出来了，还会有什么问题呢？当上级提出重新进行思想发动的时候，新兴农业社社务委员胡新安说：“社章都订了，还动员什么？”
    这些基本上巩固的农业社，都存在这些问题，那些一般的农业社，可想而知了。麻痹、自满是不对的；形式主义地把农业社“整顿”一遍，是不会起什么作用的。应该真正深入到群众中去，充分了解社员的真实思想，严格贯彻自愿、互利政策，进行细致的整顿工作，把能够巩固的农业社真正巩固起来。
