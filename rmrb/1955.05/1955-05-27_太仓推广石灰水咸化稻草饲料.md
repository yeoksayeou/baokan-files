Taicang Promotes Lime Water Salinization of Rice Straw Fodder

Farmers in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, are vigorously promoting the use of lime water salinization of rice straw and other substitute feeds for pigs, eliminating farmers' concerns about insufficient pig feed supply. In the past month or so, the number of pigs raised by farmers throughout the county has increased from 12,000 to more than 30,700. The HONGJING Township Peace Agricultural Production Cooperative originally raised six pigs, and now raises twenty-six, with the whole township increasing the number of piglets raised by more than one hundred and fifty in three months.

Using lime water to salinize rice straw to feed pigs is an advanced Soviet experience. After the rice straw is salinized with lime, its nutritional value will increase by one and a half to two times. The actual experiments of Ma Fengzhou and others from the Taixing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shaxi District, Taicang County, have also proven this point. Ma Fengzhou had a pig weighing fifty pounds, which was fed lime water salinized rice straw for three months and grew to one hundred and twenty pounds, and the cost was more than one-third lower than just feeding fine bran.

In order to vigorously promote this new method, Taicang County recently held a special forum for veteran farmers to conduct research and promotion.

　　太仓推广石灰水咸化稻草饲料
    江苏省太仓县农民大力推广石灰水咸化稻草等代饲料喂猪，消除了农民怕猪饲料供应不足的顾虑。在最近一个多月以来，全县农民养猪数已由一万二千头增加到三万零七百多头。洪泾乡和平农业生产合作社原养猪六头，现养了二十六头，全乡三个月内增养了猪仔一百五十多头。
    用石灰水咸化稻草喂猪是苏联的先进经验，稻草经过石灰咸化后，将增加营养价值一倍半到二倍。太仓县沙溪区泰星农业生产合作社员马凤洲等的实际试验也证明了这点。马凤洲一头五十斤重的猪，喂了三个月石灰水咸化稻草，便长到一百二十斤重，成本也比净喂细糠降低三分之一以上。
    为了大力推广这种新办法，太仓县不久前还专门召开了老农座谈会进行了研究和推广。
