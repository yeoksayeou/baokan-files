　　Another Artificial Rainfall Station Built in Shanghai Suburbs
　　Another artificial rainfall irrigation station has recently been completed in the suburbs of Shanghai, and a water release ceremony was held on the afternoon of May 3rd. This newly built artificial rainfall irrigation station is located at the state-owned Huacao Farm in the suburbs. It has a 130-meter-long sprinkler pipe with thirteen sprinkler nozzles. If all nozzles are spraying water simultaneously, it can irrigate two mu of vegetable area within five minutes. If the entire artificial rainfall equipment is used for mobile irrigation, it can irrigate 600 to 800 mu of land. This artificial rainfall irrigation station is designed based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and has many important improvements compared to the Dachang District artificial rainfall station built last year. In the past, the water pump was installed in a fixed building, and irrigation was carried out through buried underground pipes. This time, the water pump is installed on a wooden boat, and irrigation is carried out through movable above-ground pipes. The pipes can be moved, thus expanding the irrigation area and saving a lot of the cost required for burying underground pipes. The improved sprinkler nozzles also spray finer and more uniform water than before. This artificial rainfall irrigation station will not only serve this farm but is also prepared to spray water for the fields of nearby farmers at a very low fee.

### 上海市郊又建一座人工降雨站

　　上海市郊又建一座人工降雨站
    上海市郊区最近又建成一座人工降雨灌溉站，并在五月三日下午举行了放水典礼。这座新建的人工降雨灌溉站，在郊区的国营华漕农场，它有长达一百三十公尺的喷水管，有十三个喷水龙头，如果同时喷水，五分钟内即可灌溉蔬菜面积二亩。若以整个人工降雨设备流动灌溉，能灌田六百亩至八百亩。这座人工降雨灌溉站是根据苏联的先进经验设计的，较去年建成的大场区人工降雨站有许多重要的改进，过去是将抽水机装在固定的房子内，通过埋在地下的水管进行灌溉，这次是将抽水机装在一只木船上，通过活动的地上水管进行灌溉，水管可以搬动，这样就扩大了灌溉面积，节省许多埋藏地下水管时所需的费用。喷水龙头经过改进喷出的水也比过去更细更均匀。这座人工降雨灌溉站，不仅将为本农场服务，并准备为附近农民的田野喷水，收费也很低廉。
