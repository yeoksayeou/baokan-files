　　Dear Comrades:

　　The Warsaw Conference of European countries to guarantee European peace and security has achieved a historically significant accomplishment after four days of solemn work. The Chinese people, together with all peace-loving people of the world, warmly celebrate the complete success of the conference. The results of the Warsaw Conference once again demonstrate the firm resolve of the participating countries to ensure European peace and security, and also demonstrate the unity and strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This resolve and strength cannot be ignored by anyone.

　　The correct path to maintaining peace and security pointed out by the conference is fully in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of all countries in the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the decisions made at the Warsaw Conference are a major contribution to world peace. It is not only a very necessary measure to ensure European peace and security, but also will have a profound impact on peace and security in Asia.

　　I am authorized to declare on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China: Our government and six hundred million people give full support and cooperation to the "Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Romania, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Czechoslovak Republic" and the decision to establish a Joint Command of the armed forces of the Contracting States that was just signed. We believe that these achievements of the conference will further unite the peace-loving countries and people of the world and greatly promote the cause of European and world peace and security.
