　　Saudi Arabia
  　Uncovers Plot to Overthrow King
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 27th: According to the Lebanese "Al-Hayat" newspaper, citing well-informed sources, Saudi Arabia has uncovered a plot to overthrow King Saud.
  The newspaper pointed out that the plot involved some important government officials. Government authorities have arrested more than 400 people on charges of participating in the conspiracy. "Al-Hayat" said that several people have already been executed.
      "Al-Hayat" said that not long ago, a group of Lebanese, Jordanian, and Palestinian Arabs working for "Aramco" were expelled by the Saudi Arabian authorities. The reason for the expulsion was their connection with the Syrian National Socialist Party, which was recently disbanded for plotting against the government. Beirut press circles believe that these events are related to the dissatisfaction of certain Western countries with Saudi Arabia's position, which opposes the Turkish-Iraqi pact and is preparing to form an alliance with Egypt and Syria.

　　沙特阿拉伯
  　破获阴谋推翻国王的案件
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特二十七日讯：黎巴嫩“生活报”援引消息灵通人士的消息说，沙特阿拉伯破获了一件阴谋推翻国王沙特的案件。
  报纸指出，这个阴谋牵连到一些政府重要官员。政府当局以参加阴谋罪逮捕了四百多人。“生活报”说，有几个人已经被处决。
      “生活报”说，不久以前，有一批在“阿美石油公司”工作的黎巴嫩人、约旦人和巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人曾被沙特阿拉伯当局驱逐出境。被驱逐的原因是他们同不久前因策划反对政府的阴谋而被解散的叙利亚国家社会党有联系。贝鲁特新闻界认为，这些事件同某些西方国家不满意沙特阿拉伯的立场有关系，沙特阿拉伯是反对土耳其—伊拉克条约和准备同埃及和叙利亚缔结联盟的。
