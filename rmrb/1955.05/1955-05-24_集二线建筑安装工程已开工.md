　　127 construction and installation projects on the Jining-Erlian Railway have now commenced. In May, the amount of earth and stonework at the Jining North Station site exceeded the total amount completed from January to April. At the Xialahuoli Station, more than 200 kilometers from Jining, 14 housing projects began in April, including a large locomotive depot and a wheelset washing and inspection facility. The water supply project for the entire Jining-Erlian line, with the exception of Erlian and two other locations where it has been completed, is also under construction. The signal installation project at key stations such as Jining also began in mid-May. Recently, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is undertaking the construction of the Jining-Erlian Railway, held a telephone conference for all road construction workers on the line. At the meeting, all units put forward the competitive slogan of "Guaranteeing the Timely Organization of Through Traffic and Joint Transportation."

　  集二线建筑安装工程已开工
    集二线各项建筑安装工程现在已有一百二十七项开工。集宁北站站场五月份的土、石方工作量比一月到四月份的总和还大。距离集宁二百多公里的夏拉呼里车站，四月份就有十四处房屋工程开工，其中有巨大的机务段厂房、落轮洗检所等。集二线全线的给水工程除二连和其他两处已竣工外，也都正在施工。集宁等枢纽站的信号安装工程也在五月中旬动工了。不久前，承建集二线的铁道部新建铁路第三工程局召开了全线修路职工电话会议，会上各单位都提出了“保证按时组织通车联运”的竞赛口号。　（新华社）
