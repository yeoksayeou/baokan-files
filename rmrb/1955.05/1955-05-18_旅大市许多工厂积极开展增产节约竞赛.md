Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 17th: Many state-owned and local state-owned factories in Lüda City are actively carrying out production increase and economy practice competitions. Many factories have already drawn up plans for carrying out the production increase and economy practice competitions. Dalian Crane Factory, based on the fact that the factory often fails to complete state plans, has low quality, and wastes a lot of raw materials, has determined that the focus of production increase and economy practice is to strengthen production technology preparation work, ensure the completion of state plans on time or ahead of schedule, improve quality, strengthen raw material management, and reduce waste. The factory's workshops and departments are currently further studying specific problems in production and are starting to formulate measures and plans. Dalian Machine Tool Factory, focusing on improving quality, ensuring the completion of trial production and the task of producing new products, and reducing the consumption of metal raw materials, has put forward specific requirements for production increase and economy practice to each department and workshop. Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory held meetings of Party activists and delegate conferences of the Communist Youth League members, mobilizing them to increase production and practice economy, and established many youth economy supervision teams. The production increase and economy practice competition is in full swing. Dalian Shipbuilding Company mobilized administrative departments to conduct in-depth inspections of existing problems in practical work in a focused manner, and is summarizing the economy practice experiences of advanced workers in the blanking, gas, and carpentry trades, preparing to conduct education among all employees of the factory.

The production increase and economy practice competition in Lüda City is being carried out under the leadership and promotion of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and trade union organizations. The Industrial Department of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions held meetings of leading cadres of various factories and representative meetings of labor models of industrial and mining enterprises on May 6th and 12th respectively, and conducted detailed discussions and research on the significance, principles, and specific methods of carrying out this competition.

　　旅大市许多工厂积极开展增产节约竞赛
    新华社旅大十七日电　旅大市大部分国营和地方国营工厂正在积极开展增产节约竞赛。不少工厂已经订出了开展增产节约竞赛的计划。大连起重机器厂根据本厂常常不能完成国家计划和质量低、原材料浪费大的情况，确定增产节约的重点是加强生产技术准备工作，保证按期和提前完成国家计划，以及提高质量，加强原材料管理，减少浪费。这个厂的各车间和各科室目前正在进一步研究生产中的具体问题，并着手制定措施计划。大连机床厂以提高质量、保证完成试制和生产新产品的任务以及降低金属原材料消耗为重点，对各科室和车间提出了具体的增产节约的要求。大连工矿车辆厂召开了党活动分子会议和团员代表大会，动员增产节约，并成立了许多青年节约监督队，增产节约竞赛正热烈展开。大连造船公司发动行政各部门有重点地深入检查实际工作中存在的问题，并正在总结下料、瓦斯、木工等工种先进工人的节约经验，准备在全厂职工中进行教育。
    旅大市增产节约竞赛是在中共旅大市委员会和工会组织的领导和推动下进行的。中共旅大市委员会工业部和旅大市工会联合会曾在五月六日和十二日分别召开了各工厂领导干部会议和工矿企业劳动模范代表会议，对于开展这一竞赛的意义、方针和具体作法作了详细的讨论和研究。
