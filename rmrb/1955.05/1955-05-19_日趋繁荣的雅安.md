　　Increasingly Prosperous Ya'an
　　Xian Yu
　　On the banks of the Qingyi River, at the starting point of the Kangzang Highway, lies a beautiful mountain city: Ya'an City. Ya'an is the political, economic, and cultural center of Xikang Province. Ascending Cangping Mountain in the city and looking down, one can see that a new urban area has been built next to the old city. Along the north bank of the Qiong River, a large area of red and gray new buildings has been erected. Among these buildings are factories, schools, theaters, cinemas, bookstores, banks, department stores, residential buildings, and office buildings for various government agencies. Next to the foot of Cangping Mountain, there is also a large-scale Ya'an First Hospital.
　　Before liberation, Ya'an was a city with basically no industry, only a few small workshops with very simple equipment. After liberation, the People's Government newly built, renovated, and expanded more than a dozen factories and enterprises in Ya'an, including an automobile repair factory, a mica processing factory, a tea factory, a hydroelectric power plant, a leather factory, a farm tool factory, and a waterworks, with a construction area of more than 100,000 square meters. The establishment of these factories has played a significant role in supporting national construction, supporting agricultural production, and supplying the needs of the people's lives. The mica processed by the mica processing factory, and the timber produced by the Xikang Forestry Industry Bureau, are directly transported to the Northeast and Southwest, strongly supporting China's electrical industry and basic construction. In order to meet the needs of Ya'an's urban development, the Ya'an Hydroelectric Power Plant, which has already undergone one expansion, began its second expansion project in March of this year. In the first quarter of next year, the new generator will be put into production, at which time the hydroelectric power plant will supply more than twice the current amount of electricity to meet the power needs of Ya'an City and the electricity needs of its citizens. The Ya'an Automobile Repair Factory, which is responsible for repairing automobiles on the Kangzang area and provincial highways, has also experienced significant development in production over the past few years. Now, some of its main production processes have become mechanized, and labor productivity has increased by more than three times compared to before liberation. The Ya'an Tea Factory, which supplies tea needed by ethnic minority areas, has increased its total output value this year by three times compared to the early days of liberation, and by about 30 percent compared to last year. The Ya'an Farm Tool Factory is also undergoing expansion. Soon, it will be able to use the latest equipment to produce various new types of farm tools for ethnic minorities and local farmers, supporting agricultural production.
　　More and more schools are appearing in the urban area of Ya'an, training talents for national construction. In Shangba, this future cultural district, more than a dozen new-type schools have been built successively, including vocational training courses of a specialized nature such as banking, trade, health, postal and telecommunications, cooperative business, and trade unions, as well as Ya'an Middle School, Ya'an Normal School, Worker-Peasant Accelerated Middle School, the CCP Xikang Provincial Party School, and other schools. An Eighth Primary School that can accommodate three to four hundred students will soon begin construction on the north bank of the Qiong River.
　　With the continuous development of the economy and cultural undertakings, Ya'an's municipal construction has also achieved remarkable achievements. Before liberation, the city had only more than 1,500 meters of blocked and impassable sewers, and 11,000 meters of uneven dirt roads. The city had no public toilets, no street lights, and no safe entertainment venues. One-third of the residents lived in dirty, dark shacks. Two families lived within an area of about six square meters under a large tree. After nightfall, citizens would tightly close their doors, and the dark city became a playground for soldiers, thugs, and opium merchants. Now, Ya'an has changed its desolate, neglected, dirty, and dilapidated original appearance, and a new, prosperous, and beautiful Ya'an has been built. The city's population has increased from more than 20,000 before liberation to more than 70,000. Within the urban area and near the suburbs, 23,000 meters of new and newly opened cement roads, gravel roads, and graded roads have been built. A transportation network with Ya'an as the center, the Kangzang Highway, the Kangdian Highway, and the ChuanKang Highway as the main lines, interwoven with large and small roads and post roads throughout the province, has taken initial shape. Every day, the Kangzang Highway, the Kangdian Highway, and the ChuanKang Highway are filled with vehicles carrying goods, and the busy transportation has propelled Ya'an to a stage of prosperity that it has never experienced in history. All of the blocked and impassable sewers within the urban area have been dredged, and another 32,500 meters of new and renovated sewers have been built. The city has also laid 20,000 meters of tap water pipes, and now the waterworks sells 600 tons of water per day. The city has also built nearly 20,000 square meters of staff dormitories, solving the housing problems of about 4,000 homeless and displaced working people. In the past, places overgrown with weeds have now been transformed into a square that can accommodate 40,000 people, and flowers, plants, and trees have been cultivated next to the square. The well-equipped Workers' Club was completed last year and has become a place for workers, students, government cadres, and working people to relax and rest on holidays. The city has also built more than a dozen new public toilets, installed hundreds of street lights, and many street broadcasts. This year, the city will also carry out about 100,000 square meters of basic construction. The future Ya'an will be more lively, more beautiful, and more prosperous than it is now.

### 日趋繁荣的雅安

　　日趋繁荣的雅安
　　鲜于
    在康藏公路起点的青衣江畔，有一座美丽的山城，这就是雅安市。雅安是西康省政治、经济、文化的中心，登上城区的苍坪山向下俯瞰，便可以看见：在旧城区旁边修起了新市区。沿着羗江北岸，修起了一大片红色和灰色的新房子。这些建筑物中，有工厂、学校、剧院、电影院、书店、银行、百货公司、居民住宅和各机关的办公大楼。紧挨着苍坪山脚，还有一所规模宏大的雅安第一医院。
    解放前，雅安是一个基本上没有工业的城市，仅有几家设备很简陋的小作坊。解放后，人民政府在雅安新建改建和扩建了汽车修理厂、云母加工厂、茶厂、水电厂、皮革厂、农具厂和自来水厂等十几个工厂企业，建筑面积达十万平方公尺以上。这些工厂的建立，对支援国家建设、支援农业生产和供应人民的生活需要都起了很大作用。云母加工厂加工的云母，和西康森林工业局生产的木材，直接运往东北和西南，有力地支援了我国电气工业和基本建设。为了适应雅安市建设发展的需要，曾经进行过一次扩建的雅安水电厂，又在今年三月开始进行第二次扩建工程。明年第一季度，新发电机即将投入生产，那时，水电厂将以比现在多一倍以上的电力，供应雅安市动力用电和市民用电的需要。担负着康藏地区和省内各公路汽车修理任务的雅安汽车修理厂，几年来生产也有了很大发展。现在，它的部分主要生产过程已经走向机械化，劳动生产率较解放前增涨了三倍多。供应少数民族地区饮茶需要的雅安茶厂，今年的生产总值已比解放初期增加三倍，比去年增加约百分之三十。雅安农具厂也正在进行扩建，不久以后，就可以用最新的设备为少数民族和当地农民生产各种新式农具，支援农业生产。
    为国家培养建设人材的学校已愈来愈多地在雅安市区出现。在上坝，这个未来的文化区，已先后修建了十几座新型学校，其中包括银行、贸易、卫生、邮电、合作事业、工会等专业性质的训练班以及雅安中学、雅安师范学校、工农速成中学、中共西康省委党校等学校，一所可容纳三四百名学生的第八小学，不久就要在羗江北岸动工修建。
    随着经济和文化事业的不断发展，雅安市的市政建设也获得了显著成就。解放前，全市只有一千五百多公尺阻塞不通的下水道，和一万一千公尺凸凹不平的黄泥路。全市没有一个公共厕所，没有一盏路灯，没有一个安全的娱乐场所。有三分之一的居民，居住在污秽、阴暗的草棚里。在一根大树下大约六个平方公尺的范围内也住了两家人。入夜以后，市民们都双门紧闭，黑暗的城市成为兵痞、流氓和贩卖鸦片商人的活动场所。现在，雅安已经改变了荒凉冷落、污秽破败的原来面貌，一座新的、繁荣美丽的雅安已建设起来。全市人口已由解放前的两万增加到七万以上。市区以内和城郊附近，已新建和新辟了水泥路、砂砾路和级配路二万三千公尺。一个以雅安为中心，以康藏公路、康滇公路、川康公路为主干，交织着全省大小车路和驿道的交通网已经初步形成。每天，康藏公路、康滇公路和川康公路上，川流不息地奔驰着满载物资的汽车，繁忙的交通运输把雅安推进到历史上从未有过的繁荣阶段。市区以内阻塞不通的下水道已全部疏通了，另外还新建和改建了三万二千五百公尺的下水道。全市还铺设了两万公尺的自来水管，现在，自来水工厂每天的售水量已达六百吨。全市还修建了近二万平方公尺的职工宿舍，解决了四千左右无屋可住、无家可归的劳动人民的居住问题。以前荒草丛生的地方，现在已修起了一个能容纳四万人的广场，广场旁边还培植了花草树木。设备完善的工人俱乐部已经在去年落成，成为全市工人、学生，机关干部和劳动人民假日游憩休息的场所。全市还新修了十多个公共厕所，设置了数百盏街灯，以及许多街头广播。今年，全市又要进行约十万平方公尺的基本建设。未来的雅安将比现在更加热闹，更加美丽和繁荣。　（原载西康日报本报略有删改）
