　　Tianjin Special District Reforms Agricultural Production in Low-Lying Areas

    Farmers in the low-lying areas of Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, are undertaking agricultural production reforms.

    Tianjin Special District is located downstream of rivers such as the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Yongding River. The terrain is low-lying, with one-third of the district's area being low-lying land. In addition, frequent rainfall occurs every year between July and August. These areas suffer from flooding year after year, causing great losses to the country and the people. In order to change this situation, in October 1954, the Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a plan for agricultural production reform in low-lying areas to expand the planting of early-maturing crops and to convert to rice cultivation. It also trained a large number of technical personnel and prepared more than 26 million jin of various crop seeds.

    At present, farmers have completed the sowing of more than 1 million mu of early-maturing crops such as spring wheat. Together with more than 3.2 million mu of winter wheat, the summer harvest crop area of the entire special district accounts for more than 30 percent of the total cultivated area. Preparations for converting more than 950,000 mu to water-tolerant crops such as rice have been completed, and more than 37,000 mu of dry rice have been sown. In order to ensure the implementation of this conversion plan, fourteen drainage and flood control projects and projects to stabilize the water level of low-lying depressions will be constructed. Construction has begun on nine projects, and the other five are being prepared for commencement. After the implementation of these two increased production plans, the entire district can harvest an additional 160 million jin of grain this year.

　  天津专区改革洼地农业生产
    河北省天津专区低洼地区农民正在进行农业生产改革。
    天津专区位于大清河、子牙河、永定河等河流下游，地势低洼，全区三分之一的面积是洼地，加上每年七八月间多雨，这些地区年年遭受水灾，给国家和人民造成很大损失。为了改变这种情况，一九五四年十月中共天津地委会制定了扩种早熟作物和改种水稻的低洼地区农业生产改革计划，并训练了大批技术骨干，还准备了各种作物种籽二千六百多万斤。
    目前农民已完成播种春小麦等早熟作物一百多万亩，加上三百二十多万亩冬小麦，全专区夏收作物面积占总耕地面积百分之三十以上。改种九十五万多亩水稻等耐水作物的准备工作已做妥，并已播种了三万七千多亩旱稻。为了保证这项改种计划实现，还要修建排水防涝和固定洼淀水位工程十四处，现已有九处开工，其他五处也正准备开工。这两项增产计划实现后，全区今年可多收一亿六千多万斤粮食。
