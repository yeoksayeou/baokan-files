Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 23rd: According to a TASS report from Vienna on May 22nd: The Austrian Communist Party News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, at its plenary session on the 20th, discussed the party's tasks after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty and passed a resolution.

The resolution stated: The Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party welcomes the signing of the Austrian State Treaty based on the principles of Austrian neutrality and independence. The signing of this treaty is a major historical event for our country. Our struggle to establish an independent, free, and democratic Austria has thus completed one of its stages.

The resolution pointed out: The signing of the Austrian State Treaty based on the principles of Austrian neutrality and independence was made possible by the policy pursued by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has shown through its actions that it is Austria's best friend.

The resolution continued: Ensuring and consolidating Austria's neutrality and independence is the primary task of the Austrian people in this new historical stage. The resolution stated that this task should be defined by the following points:

	One, demand that the Austrian Parliament and the parliaments of the Four Powers quickly ratify the Austrian State Treaty.

	Two, Austria's neutrality should be enshrined in the constitution.

	Three, according to the Moscow Agreement, the Austrian government must do its best to seek recognition of this neutrality from the major powers.

	Four, demand that Austria and the other countries that signed the treaty strictly adhere to the terms of the Austrian State Treaty.

	Five, a policy of peace and mutual understanding between peoples is the most important prerequisite for defending and safeguarding Austria's neutrality. Therefore, the Austrian people must pay attention to whether the Austrian government will support all efforts aimed at ending the Cold War and consolidating peace in the future.

The resolution pointed out: German imperialists have not abandoned their plans for a new "Anschluss." However, Austria is now capable of thwarting all plans of German militarists, as long as the government resolutely implements a policy of neutrality, independence, and mutual understanding.

The resolution also pointed out that the Austrian State Treaty gives Austria the possibility of achieving economic independence. The resolution stated that it is necessary to prevent the transfer of Austrian enterprises to foreign concerns and monopoly capitalists.

The resolution concluded by saying that the most important task now is to explain to the working people the significance of the Austrian State Treaty and Austrian neutrality, as well as the prospects facing our country. All organizations of our party and all party members should participate in this work.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna: According to a TASS report from Vienna, the Executive Committee of the Austrian Peace Council held an enlarged meeting in Vienna on the 21st to celebrate the signing of the Austrian State Treaty.

Duncan Jones (Britain), Secretary of the World Peace Council, attended the meeting and congratulated the Austrian peace fighters.

Professor Brandweiner, Chairman of the Austrian Peace Council, delivered a report at the meeting, pointing out that Austria was able to gain sovereignty because, for the first time in its history, it decided to pursue its own independent foreign policy. Austria will permanently maintain neutrality like Switzerland. The recognition and observance of Austria's permanent neutrality by the Four Powers will help ease tensions in Europe.

Brandweiner then pointed out that the peace fighters of Austria are not satisfied with this. There are still many major issues in the world that remain unresolved. The solution of the German question, the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China and the safeguarding of its territorial integrity, the opposition to the danger of war, the striving for disarmament, and the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction are the main tasks of the world peace movement.

　　奥地利共产党中央就当前任务通过决议
    奥和平理事会执委会庆祝签订奥地利国家条约
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社维也纳二十二日讯：奥地利共产党新闻处消息：奥地利共产党中央委员会在二十日举行的全体会议上，讨论了党在奥地利国家条约签订之后的任务，并且通过了一项决议。
    决议说：奥地利共产党中央委员会欢迎关于以奥地利中立和独立为原则的奥地利国家条约的签订。签订这一条约，对我们国家来说是一件具有重大的历史意义的事件。我们争取建立独立、自由和民主的奥地利的斗争已由此而完成了它的一个阶段。
    决议指出：在奥地利中立和独立的原则上签订奥地利国家条约之所以成为可能，是由于苏联所实行的政策。苏联以自己的行动表明它是奥地利的最好的朋友。
    决议接着指出：保证和巩固奥地利的中立和独立，是奥地利人民在目前新的历史阶段中的首要任务。决议说，应以下列各条确定这一任务：
    一、要求奥地利议会和四大国议会迅速批准奥地利国家条约。
    二、奥地利的中立应该用宪法固定下来。
    三、根据莫斯科协议，奥地利政府必须尽力求得各大国承认这种中立。
    四、要求奥地利以及签订这一条约的其他国家严格遵守奥地利国家条约的条款。
    五、和平政策和各国人民之间的相互谅解的政策是保卫和保障奥地利中立的最重要的先决条件。因此奥地利人民必须注意奥地利政府在将来是否支持旨在结束冷战和巩固和平的一切努力。
    决议指出：德国帝国主义者并没有放弃新的
  “德奥合并”计划。但是，奥地利现在有能力打破德国军国主义者的一切计划，只要政府坚决执行中立、独立和互相谅解的政策。
    决议还指出，奥地利国家条约给奥地利以获得经济独立的可能性。决议说，必须制止把奥地利的企业转入外国康采恩和垄断资本家手中。
    决议最后说，现在最重要的工作，就是向劳动人民说明奥地利国家条约和奥地利中立的意义，以及我们国家面临的远景。我们党的一切组织和全体党员都应当参加这个工作。
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利和平理事会执行委员会二十一日在维也纳举行扩大会议，庆祝奥地利国家条约的签订。
    世界和平理事会书记邓肯·琼斯（英国）出席会议，向奥地利和平战士祝贺。
    奥地利和平理事会主席布兰德魏纳教授在会上做了报告，他指出，奥地利所以能够获得主权，是因为奥地利有史以来第一次决定奉行自己的独立的外交政策。奥地利将永久保持像瑞士那样的中立。四大国承认和遵守奥地利永久中立的状态，这将有助于缓和欧洲的紧张局势。
    布兰德魏纳接着指出，奥地利的和平战士并不就此满足。世界上还有许多重大问题悬而未决。德国问题的解决，恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利和保障它的领土完整，反对战争危险、争取裁减军备和禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器，这些都是世界和平运动的主要任务。
