Improving Methods for Harvesting Rapeseed
　　Zhang Zhiyuan

　　Most rapeseed producing areas will enter the harvest stage in mid to late May.

　　The method of harvesting rapeseed in most rapeseed producing areas is generally to first cut down or uproot the rapeseed and expose it to the sun in the fields, allowing chickens and dogs to trample it. After it dries, threshing is carried out in the field, resulting in a lot of scattering. According to estimates by the Wenjiang Farm in Sichuan: using this method to harvest rapeseed generally results in a loss of 2% of the seeds. At the same time, using this method to harvest rapeseed easily mixes in mud and sand; the presence of mud and sand in the rapeseed will reduce the oil yield. According to research by the state-owned Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory, "flat-shoulder mud" (mud particles the same size as rapeseed) absorbs oil during oil extraction, resulting in a loss of about five catties of oil per ton of rapeseed.

　　From the above situation, the extensive method of harvesting rapeseed causes great losses to both farmers and the country. Taking the 2% scattering loss as an example, if calculated on a national scale, it would result in 40 million catties being scattered. If the "flat-shoulder mud" in rapeseed absorbs oil, calculated based on the total national rapeseed production, it would result in a loss of 26 million catties of rapeseed oil.

　　A more meticulous method of harvesting rapeseed is: during the harvest, timely harvesting should be ensured, using sickles to cut the rapeseed, without uprooting it, to prevent mud and impurities from mixing in; threshing is best carried out on a mat-covered drying yard or in a "threshing barrel," and prevent chickens and dogs from trampling on it. Doing so will not only reduce seed scattering but also prevent mud and impurities from mixing in.

　　In addition, in 1954, the average national rapeseed yield was 69 catties per mu. Sichuan Province, with the highest yield, averaged 104 catties per mu, while Jiangxi Province, with the lowest yield, averaged less than 30 catties per mu. The reason why Sichuan Province's rapeseed yield is more than twice that of Jiangxi Province is that, in addition to the more refined cultivation techniques of Sichuan farmers, another important reason is that they selected superior varieties. Most rapeseed producing areas in our country have superior varieties. In addition to "Victory Rapeseed," Sichuan Province also has local improved varieties such as Xindu "Dwarf Rapeseed," Wenjiang "Cinnabar Red Rapeseed," and "Seven-Star Sword." These improved varieties generally yield more than 150 catties per mu. Rapeseed from Longwu in Yunnan Province has an oil content of over 40%. "Xishui Rapeseed" and "Jianshi Yellow Rapeseed" in Hubei Province, and "Ginger Yellow Rapeseed" in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas are also better rapeseed varieties. All rapeseed producing areas should combine harvesting with actively carrying out seed selection and seed retention work to prepare for expanding the planting area of superior rapeseed varieties in the future.

### 改进收获油菜的方法

　　改进收获油菜的方法
　　张止渊
    大部油菜产区将在五月中下旬进入收获阶段。
    多数油菜产区收获油菜的方法，一般是先把油菜割倒或连根拔起，放在田野曝晒，任凭鸡犬践踏，晒干后即在田间进行脱粒，以致抛撒很多。据四川温江农场的估计：用这种方法收割油菜，一般要损失菜籽百分之二。同时用这种方法收割油菜，还容易掺入泥沙；菜籽中混入泥沙就会降低出油率。据国营上海油脂一厂研究，榨油时由于“平肩泥”（像菜籽一样大的泥粒）吸取油脂，每吨菜籽约损失五斤油。
    从上面的情况看，粗放的收获油菜的方法对农民和国家都有很大损失。以抛撒百分之二的收获量说，若就全国范围计算，就要抛撒四千万斤。菜籽中的“平肩泥”吸油，若照全国油菜籽总产量计算，要损失菜油二千六百万斤。
    比较细致的收获油菜的方法是：在收获中，应做到收割及时，用镰刀收割，不要连根拔起，以免泥杂混入；脱粒最好在有垫席的晒场上或在“掼桶”内进行，并防止鸡犬践踏。这样做，不但可以减少籽粒抛撒，同时可以避免泥杂混入。
    另外，一九五四年全国油菜籽平均产量每亩六十九斤，产量最高的四川省平均每亩产一百零四斤，最低的江西省平均每亩产还不到三十斤。四川省的油菜产量所以能高出江西省的二倍多，除了四川农民的栽培技术较精细外，另一重要原因就是他们选用了优良品种。我国大部油菜产区都有优良品种，四川省除“胜利油菜”外，还有新都
  “矮油菜”、温江“珠砂红菜籽”和“七星剑”等地方良种，这些良种一般每亩产量都在一百五十斤以上。云南省龙武的油菜，含油率在百分之四十以上。湖北省的“浠水油菜”和“建始黄油菜”，江浙一带的“姜黄菜籽”等，也都是较好的油菜品种。各油菜产区应结合收获，积极开展选种和留种工作，为今后扩大优良油菜品种播种面积作好准备。
