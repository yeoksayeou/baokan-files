The Second Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Xikang Province was held in Ya'an City from April 23rd to 30th.
    The meeting pointed out that in the past two years, the Xikang Provincial Youth League organizations have played an active role in various central tasks of the Party and the government. For example, the Danba Mica Mine on the Kangzang Plateau has seen the emergence of a youth shock brigade led by Mo Luo (Tibetan), who overfulfilled their tasks. A large number of young agricultural labor models and production activists have emerged in ethnic minority areas. Youth League member Angwang Tsering (Tibetan) responded to the government's call to improve farming techniques in 1954, greatly increasing the yield of his crops, exceeding the general yield by 91 percent. The Xikang Provincial Committee of the Youth League specially awarded the title of model Youth League member to Mo Luo (Tibetan) and 40 others at the meeting, and also issued medals and certificates. Liao Zhigao, Secretary of the Xikang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also came to the meeting to give instructions on the work of the Youth League in the province. The meeting also elected members of the Second Committee of the Xikang Provincial Committee of the Youth League. Wang Yimu (Han), Yangling Dorje (Tibetan), Boshijiajia (Yi), and 24 others were elected as members. (Our correspondent in Ya'an)

　　西康召开青年团二次代表大会
    中国新民主主义青年团西康省第二次代表大会于四月二十三日至三十日在雅安市举行。　　会议指出，两年来西康省的青年团组织在党和政府的各项中心工作中发挥了积极作用。比如康藏高原上的丹巴云母矿已经出现了以莫洛（藏族）为首的青年突击队，他们超额完成了任务。民族地区已经涌现出了大批青年农业劳动模范和生产积极分子。青年团员昂旺茨烈（藏族）一九五四年响应政府改进耕作技术的号召，使自己所种作物的产量大大提高，超过一般产量的百分之九十一。青年团西康省委员会在会上特授给莫洛（藏族）等四十一人以模范团员称号，同时颁发给奖章、奖状。中共西康省委员会书记廖志高也到会对该省青年团的工作作了指示。会议还选出了青年团西康省第二届委员会委员。王一木（汉族）、杨岭多吉（藏族）、博什贾贾（彝族）等二十七人当选为委员。（本报驻雅安记者）
