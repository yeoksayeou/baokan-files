Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to Tass, Polish People's Republic delegation head Cyrankiewicz spoke on May 11th at the Warsaw Conference of European Nations on Securing Peace and Security in Europe.

　　Cyrankiewicz said that the nations participating in the Moscow meeting fully recognized the consequences of the ratification of the Paris Agreements for peace and security in Europe. Therefore, they adopted a clear declaration, deeming it necessary to take joint measures in organizing armed forces and command headquarters, as well as other necessary measures to strengthen their national defense in the face of the new situation. Today, it is the sacred responsibility of the governments attending the Warsaw Conference to adopt and implement the measures we declared at the Moscow meeting.

　　Cyrankiewicz said that due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the threat of the revival of German militarism has become a complete reality. German militarism is a serious threat to the Polish people. No wise government can sit idly by in this situation.

　　Cyrankiewicz said that we do not want our independence to depend on guarantees without real content. Based on historical experience, Poland can and should obtain help from friends. In this regard, Cyrankiewicz pointed out the support and assistance of the Soviet Union to Poland. He also pointed out that, in addition, Poland has concluded defensive alliances with other Eastern European countries for ten years. He said that the alliance between democratic and socialist countries has built a barrier against German imperialism from the Baltic Sea across the whole of Europe. We must strengthen this barrier.

　　Cyrankiewicz continued: We have consistently upheld the principle of not using force as a method of resolving international disputes. Our countries will never launch aggressive wars, but we will never allow anyone to infringe upon our vital rights as they please. Therefore, in order to realize our will and to effectively deal with the approaching danger, the government of the Polish People's Republic declares its determination to participate in the treaty on security, cooperation, and mutual assistance discussed at this conference.

　　Cyrankiewicz pointed out that the most essential feature of this draft treaty is, first of all, that it is not directed against any other country, and it opens its doors to all who are willing to work with us in the cause of defending peace. It does not want to seize strategic positions favorable for offense, and it does not serve a policy of dictating to anyone. It is a treaty that unites countries that equally hate war and cherish peace in a fraternal alliance, a treaty to cope with the threat of aggression from wherever it may come. This treaty brings something completely new to our relations, thereby multiplying the effectiveness of our national defense forces several times over. Because we are establishing a joint command to improve our defense institutions and ensure the best utilization of our national defense forces.

　　Cyrankiewicz stated that while taking all these necessary measures, they do not intend to abandon their efforts to achieve universal disarmament and establish collective security organizations in the future. The struggle to ensure lasting peace will continue in the future.

　　Cyrankiewicz pointed out that although the Warsaw Conference is discussing European issues, the participating countries cannot remain silent on recent important events on other continents, and cannot separate the situation in Europe and the issue of European peace from the development of the situation on the Asian continent and the efforts made by Asia to maintain peace. There is no doubt that the Bandung Conference was a historic event in this regard. The Asian and African countries at Bandung clearly expressed their firm opposition to the "position of strength" policy, the policy of piecing together military alliances by certain major powers, as well as atomic blackmail and colonialism. They demonstrated their will to demand peaceful coexistence and peaceful cooperation regardless of social systems and political systems.

　　Referring to the treaty on security, cooperation, and mutual assistance to be signed at this conference, Cyrankiewicz emphasized that this new treaty has received the full support of the great nation – the powerful People's China. He said that those who are obsessed and enthusiastic about war, who fantasize about military and technological superiority over the peace camp, will suffer a miserable disappointment.

　　Finally, Cyrankiewicz assured the governments participating in the conference that the Polish people will spare no effort to implement the provisions of the new treaty, and will cherish the principles of cooperation among the peoples of free nations established at this conference as they would protect their own eyes.

    波兰代表团团长西伦凯维兹讲话
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰人民共和国代表团团长西伦凯维兹，十一日在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议华沙会议上讲了话。
    西伦凯维兹说，参加莫斯科会议的国家充分认识到，巴黎协定的批准对于欧洲的和平和安全有着怎样的后果，因而通过了一个明确的宣言，认为有必要在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，以及在新的局势面前为加强它们的国防力量采取其他必要的措施。今天，出席华沙会议的各国政府的神圣责任，就是采取和实行我们在莫斯科会议上宣告过的那些措施。
    西伦凯维兹说，由于巴黎协定的批准，复活德国军国主义的威胁已经完全成为现实了。德国军国主义对于波兰人民是严重的威胁。任何一个英明的政府在这种情况下都不能坐待不动。
    西伦凯维兹说，我们不希望我们的独立依赖于没有现实内容的保证。根据历史经验，波兰可能而且应当从朋友那里获得帮助。西伦凯维兹在谈到这一点时指出了苏联对波兰的支持和帮助。他同时还指出，除此以外，十年来波兰还同东欧其他国家缔结了防御同盟。他说，民主和社会主义国家之间的同盟建成了一道从波罗的海经过整个欧洲的反对德国帝国主义的壁垒。我们必须加强这道壁垒。
    西伦凯维兹接着说：我们曾经坚持不渝地维护不使用实力作为解决国际争端的方法这一原则。我们各国永远不会发动侵略战争，但是，我们决不会让任何人为所欲为地侵犯我们的切身权利。因此，为了将我们的意志付诸实现，为了切实地对付日益逼近的危险，波兰人民共和国政府宣布决心参加这次会议所讨论的安全、合作和互助条约。
    西伦凯维兹指出，这个条约草案的最本质的特征首先是，它不是为了反对任何其他国家，而且对一切愿意在保卫和平的事业中同我们共同努力的人都打开大门。它不想夺取有利于进攻的战略地位，它不是为对任何人发号施令的政策服务的。它是把同样痛恨战争和珍视和平的国家团结在兄弟联盟中的条约，是应付不论来自何方的侵略威胁的条约。这个条约给我们的关系带来了某种完全新的东西，从而把我们的国防力量的效能增加好几倍。因为我们是为了改善防御机构和保证最好地利用我们的国防力量才建立联合司令部的。
    西伦凯维兹表示，在采取这一切必要的措施时并不打算今后就放弃争取普遍裁军和建立集体安全组织的努力。争取保障持久和平的斗争今后还要继续下去。
    西伦凯维兹指出，虽然华沙会议讨论的是欧洲问题，但是参加会议的国家也不能对最近其他大陆上的重要事件保持缄默，不能把欧洲的局势和欧洲和平的问题同亚洲大陆上的局势的发展和亚洲为了维护和平所作的努力分割开来。毫无疑问，在这方面，万隆会议是一个历史性事件。亚非各国在万隆明显地表示了他们坚决反对“实力地位”政策、反对某些大国拼凑军事同盟的政策以及原子讹诈和殖民主义的政策。它们表明了要求不分社会制度和政治制度实行和平共处与和平合作的意志。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到这次会议将要签订的安全、合作和互助条约时强调指出，这一新的条约受到伟大的国家——强大的人民中国的完全支持。他说，执迷不悟和热中于战争的人，幻想指望在军事上和技术上胜过和平阵营，他们是要遭到可悲的失望的。
    西伦凯维兹最后向参加会议的各国政府保证：波兰人民将毫不吝惜自己的力量来实现新条约的规定，并且要像保护眼珠一样来爱护在这次会议上制定的自由国家人民合作的原则。
