Mr. Mayor:

　　I would like to express my greatest gratitude to the citizens of Beijing for the warm welcome they have given me at this reception and in all the places I have visited in this ancient and famous capital of your great country.

　　Although China and Indonesia are separated by a considerable expanse of sea, they have been good neighbors for many centuries. We in Indonesia know your people well. Not only is there frequent trade between our two countries, but we have no fewer than two million hardworking Chinese citizens and Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent among us; they settled in our country many years ago, bringing Chinese culture and art with them.

　　In recent times, there have been significant new developments in the relationship between China and Indonesia. Now, New China and New Indonesia are meeting face to face, and I can assure you that I am very pleased to have the opportunity to personally understand New China and the Chinese people in their own homeland.

　　We indeed have much in common. Both of our countries gained our current independence after long revolutionary struggles; both of our countries are striving to remedy the backwardness of many generations and are doing our best to develop our economies into a great national cause that primarily considers the interests of ordinary citizens.

　　If we trace history back a little further, we can see that when your country's great politician and prophet, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founded the first conscious national movement in China, it was about the same time that the Indonesian people began to awaken to the ideal of a nation-state free from colonial shackles.

　　Before our ideals became reality, both of our countries had experienced many difficult years. But now we meet each other as free, independent, and sovereign nations of a new Asia.

　　We must make full use of our freedom to serve the interests of the millions of people who, until recently, were under colonial rule or influence and whose living standards were among the lowest in the world.

　　To achieve this goal, we are following different paths. You have chosen a socialist society based on Marxism, while our guiding principles are our Pancasila, or Five Principles, which stipulate:

　　1. Belief in God, believing in religious freedom for all. 2. Humanitarianism, or internationalism—respecting humanity throughout the world.

　　3. Nationalism—believing in the national unity of all of Indonesia.

　　4. Democracy—the principle of representative government.

　　5. Social Justice—believing in the social and economic equality of all our people, and political equality.

　　I do not intend to elaborate on why I prefer this system to that system. We believe in our own system, just as you believe in yours. History may prove that both of our countries have made the right choices. Revolutions, like the ones we have experienced, cannot be standardized, and revolutions certainly cannot be exported.

　　But in this case, what is important is that we are determined to go our own way, maintain good neighborly relations, and not interfere in each other's affairs.

　　This principle of non-interference was first expressed in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by your country's Premier and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, and later included in the ten points of the Bandung Declaration unanimously adopted by the recent Asian-African Conference.

　　This conference is another important milestone in the history of Asia and Africa. A few years ago, for example, no one would have believed that it would be possible to convene twenty-nine independent Asian and African countries with very different ways of life, let alone that these countries, which have more than half of the world's population, could reach complete agreement on many issues and principles of the utmost importance to the entire world.

　　The people of Asia and Africa have proven to the world that they can speak with a united voice, and that when they unite, they have no selfish intentions or hegemonic ideas in mind. We need to achieve peace for our millions of people, first and foremost, peace. The Bandung Declaration has clearly pointed out the path to achieve this goal, the only possible path.

　　In this way, the relationship between China and Indonesia is placed within a broader scope, within the scope of a new Asia where everyone cooperates peacefully and amicably as good neighbors. I might say that our two countries have provided ample evidence that following this new approach is our sincere desire.

　　We established solid and friendly diplomatic relations several years ago; we concluded an important trade agreement; Indonesia sent a cultural delegation to China last year, and China will soon send a similar delegation to Indonesia; we recently agreed on a solution to the complex issue of the nationality of overseas Chinese in Indonesia; and your country's Premier was able to further strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries during his visit to our country, as we stated in our joint statement.

　　Mr. Mayor, I am confident that our future relations will develop according to the principles of peaceful coexistence, tolerance, common sense, friendship, and non-interference in internal affairs that we have always followed in the past.

　　I wish you, Mr. Mayor, and the citizens of Beijing prosperity and happiness, and I sincerely hope that the friendly relations that we have now so pleasantly established will continue to be maintained in the years to come.

　　I thank you.

### 沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话

　　沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话市长先生：
    北京公民在这个招待会上以及在你们伟大的国家的这个古老著名的首都的我所到过的各个地方给予我的热烈欢迎，我谨向您表示最大的感激。
    虽然中国和印度尼西亚被一个相当宽的海面分隔着，但是它们许许多多世纪以来一直是好邻人。我们在印度尼西亚的人很了解贵国人民。不但我们两国之间有经常的贸易来往，而且我们在我们中间有不下二百万勤劳的中国公民和中国血统的印度尼西亚公民；他们在许多年代以前就带着中国文化和艺术在我国定居下来。
    在最近的时期内，中国和印度尼西亚之间的关系有了重大的新发展。现在面对面相会的是新中国和新印度尼西亚，我可以肯定地向你说，我非常高兴能有机会在中国人民自己的祖国亲身了解新中国和中国人民。
    我们的确有很多共同基础。我们两国都是进行了长期的革命斗争以后才获得我们目前的独立；我们两国都正在努力补救许多世代的落后状态，并正在尽最大的力量把它们的经济发展成为一个首先考虑到普通公民的利益的伟大的举国的事业。
    如果我们再把历史追溯得稍为远一些，我们可以看出，贵国伟大的政治家和先知孙逸仙博士在中国创始第一个自觉的民族运动的时候，大约也正是印度尼西亚人民开始觉悟到一个摆脱殖民枷锁的民族国家的理想的时候。
    在我们的理想成为现实以前，我们两国都曾经经历过许多艰苦的年代。但是，现在我们作为新亚洲的自由、独立和主权国家而彼此会见了。
    我们必须充分利用我们的自由，来为在最近以前还是受到殖民统治或是影响而且他们的生活水平是属于世界上最低之列的千百万人民的利益服务。
    为了达到这个目的，我们正遵循着不同的道路。你们选择了以马克思主义为基础的社会主义社会，而我们的指针是我们的潘迪亚·西拉，或者说五大原则，这些原则规定：
    一、信仰上帝，相信人人有宗教自由。二、人道主义，或者说国际主义——尊重全世界的人类。
    三、民族主义——相信全印度尼西亚的民族团结。
    四、民主——代议制政府的原则。
    五、社会公平——相信我国所有的人在社会和经济上平等，并在政治上平等。
    我不打算详细说明为什么喜欢这个制度而不喜欢那个制度的问题。我们相信我们自己的制度，正如你们相信你们的制度一样。历史可能会证明我们两国都作出了正确的选择。革命，如我们两国所经历过的，是不可能标准化的，革命当然不可能成为输出品。
    但是，在这种情况下，重要的是：我们决心各自走自己的道路，保持睦邻关系，对彼此的事务不进行任何干涉。
    首先表现在贵国总理和印度及缅甸总理所宣布的五项和平共处原则中，后来列入由最近亚非会议一致通过的万隆宣言的十点中的就是这个互不干涉原则。
    这个会议是亚洲和非洲历史上的另一个重要里程碑。比方说几年以前，没有人会相信能够召集具有非常不同的生活方式的二十九个亚非独立国家举行一次集会，更不要说这些拥有世界一半以上人口的国家能够在对于整个世界具有最重要意义的很多问题和原则上取得完全一致的意见了。
    亚洲和非洲人民已向世界证明：他们能够发出一致的呼声，而且当他们联合起来的时候，心里并没有什么自私的打算或强权政治的想法。我们需要为我们的千百万人民取得和平，首先是和平。万隆宣言已经明确指出了达到这个目标的道路，唯一可能的道路。
      这样，中国和印度尼西亚之间的关系就放在一个更广泛的范围之内，放在人人都像善邻一样和平地和友好地合作的新亚洲范围之内。我也许可以说，我们两国已经提供了充分的证据，证明遵循这个新方针是我们诚挚的愿望。
    我们在几年以前就已经建立了巩固的和友好的外交关系；我们缔结了一个重要的贸易协定；印度尼西亚在去年派了一个文化代表团到中国来，中国不久也将派一个同样代表团到印度尼西亚；我们最近还商定了解决关于印度尼西亚华侨国籍这个错综复杂的问题的办法；贵国总理在访问我国期间和我能够进一步加强我们两国之间的友好关系，像我们在我们的联合声明中所说明的一样。
    市长先生，我确信我们在将来的关系将根据我们过去一向遵循的和平共处、容忍、常识、友好和互不干涉内政的方针发展。
    我祝您，市长先生，和北京公民繁荣和幸福，我衷心希望我们现在这样愉快地建立起来的友好关系将在未来的年代中继续保持下去。
    我向您表示感谢。
