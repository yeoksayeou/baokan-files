　　Hu Feng - The Counter-Revolutionary Gray Snake
　　Hou Wailu
　　Hu Feng's three tricks, "My Self-Criticism," "Examination," and "Appendix," were painstakingly arranged and painted from January 11th to March 26th of this year. He hoped to put on makeup and appear on stage with them. As described in his letter to Shu Wu, the strategy was: "In the middle of this, I have to squeeze out an eight-legged essay. Life is short, who knows what joke fate is playing. However, I have to 'endure.' To be a merchant, I have to gamble with my opponent. To stand in this circle and not fall, I have to accompany him in dancing the 'promotion dance'!" In the old plays, the "promotion dance" was often performed with a paper-made white-haired old man's mask, but in the end, a beautiful woman played by a young female role would reveal her true face. Since the "opponent" and "fate" wanted to "joke" with Hu Feng, and he wanted to "stand and not fall," he had to put on a mask and gamble a bit, deceiving the audience.
　　Hu Feng's carved eight-legged essay, from the opening to the conclusion, describes to the best of its ability an extraordinary and tortuous road of a "revolutionary" figure with "a great will running through China." The logic is a very beautiful trilogy.
　　His first movement goes like this:
　　Although I, Hu Feng, have some deviations or shortcomings in my "views," that is, my understanding of certain issues is not very clear or prominent, I have consistently "pursued" Marxism for the past twenty years.
　　Although I, Hu Feng, have some narrowness and lack of political nature in my "practice," judging from my twenty years of revolutionary "fighting spirit," I am still "a literary work organizer standing around the Party" and led by the Party.
　　Although I, Hu Feng, am sometimes more emotional and less healthy, judging from my attitude of clearly distinguishing between friend and foe in my twenty years of "love and hate," I am a brave man who "knows everything and says everything without reservation" to the revolution, the people, and the Party.
　　Then comes Hu Feng's "objective environment" theory, which is his second movement:
　　Because of "loyalty to the practice of this time and place...", my struggle, Hu Feng's struggle, has been oppressed, but this is due to the "specific environment"!
　　Who in the Kuomintang-controlled area can not be "limited by objective conditions and subjective circumstances"? I, Hu Feng, only expressed "sincerity" a little too much because of "my own situation." If you think this is related to the consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie, it is also a common phenomenon shared by everyone in the revolutionary ranks. You criticize me, Hu Feng, and I, Hu Feng, can also criticize you.
　　After liberation, I, Hu Feng, was still affected by the traditional "environment" and had not overcome some "emotions." I was just a little impatient when my "emotions" were hot.
　　Therefore, he comes with the third movement: since the "expansion" of my shortcomings has excusable reasons, then you should see my long-term heroic work of twenty years and the spirit of "conforming to the Party's political program" from the "great revolutionary cause," and flatter me as the principle, and should not "joke" with me from small details!
　　This is not "self-criticism"! This is utter self-promotion!
　　Get out, Hu Feng, the anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary! Today, no matter if you want to "shake hands with them with a smile covering the insults," or if you want to stand against the people with tears covering your opposition, your reactionary deception tactics cannot deceive the people.
　　The difference between Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary face and Hu Shi's counter-revolutionary face lies only in the difference between a gray snake and a white snake. The gray "beast" wants to mix into the revolutionary camp and engage in counter-revolutionary pioneering work in the Northeast and Tianjin after liberation, in order to carry out internal activities to undermine the socialist cause. This danger requires us to be more vigilant because Hu Feng is a big liar who pretends to be a revolutionary to oppose the revolution!
　　This kind of deceptive "self-criticism" is Hu Feng's propaganda of his twenty years of "My Struggle," the object of this struggle originally refers to the political and even ideological leadership after the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, that is, what he said, "It is necessary to spend more effort to shake the twenty-year mechanical rule." How to spend effort? First of all, put on the cloak of Marxism to promote idealism, "On the elevation or sublimation of the spirit, understand the independence of ideology from here, and see the power of ideals and the spirit of sacrifice from this. ...Give the philistine materialism a fatal blow." Hu Feng is such a "magnanimous heroism" who "takes the world as his responsibility" to play the ugly role of counter-revolutionaries from within and without with Hu Shi.
　　Similar to Hu Shi's building a foundation for politics in culture, Hu Feng said that "fighting against (Marxist) ideology" is just "a way of life or practice of fighting and rolling," and more importantly, fighting with the Party's leadership and "official" responsible comrades, progressive writers, etc., "to live and die with the position"; therefore, his organizational work is to "win people," "contact people," and carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.
　　Compare Hu Feng's fake set of "My Self-Criticism" with Hu Feng's true set of strategies and tactics instructed to Shu Wu! Fascist rags inside, revolutionary gold and jade outside, what kind of trick is this?
　　I cannot fail to mention one thing here. I have offended Hu Feng, this hero who has "everything ready for me," for a simple reason: in the spring of 1945, I made a critical report on "On Subjectivity" with Hu Feng in attendance. As Shu Wu revealed in his letter, I mentioned that the historical view of "On Subjectivity" came from Bukharin's theory of equilibrium, but this was not enough to provoke Hu Feng's "subjective fighting spirit" to retaliate against my well-intentioned advice. The problem was because I pointed out in my criticism of the outlook on life that "On Subjectivity" was exactly the same as the beastly "philosophy of action" of the Italian fascist philosopher Perret. At the same time, I also said that the "Stalin era" in "On Subjectivity" was actually a disguise of the fascist era. This made Hu Feng say to Shu Wu, "Philosophers and officials belong to the former (meaning to suffocate Shu Wu)". Now that I think about it, I was fooled at the time, because I said at the end of the report, "I am referring to Shu Wu, as for Mr. Hu Feng's thoughts, they may not be the same as Shu Wu's." At the same time, my experience also proved that Shu Wu's exposure was true, that is, Hu Feng said, "My answer is: ask them to write articles." Hu Feng met me twice and said to me, "Please write articles." Hu Feng said, "Shake hands with them with a smile covering the insults." He really always smiled and shook hands when we met after that report. However, I did not know what he was "covering" at the time? Shu Wu's materials made me understand a lot!
　　I agree with the editor's note in the People's Daily, "Hu Feng should do the work of stripping off the mask, not a deceptive review," "All Hu Feng elements who are willing to repent should stand up to criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and start a new life." The people's patience is limited!

　　胡风——反革命的灰色蛇
　　侯外庐
    胡风的“我的自我批判”、“检查”和“附记”三套戏法，是从本年一月十一日、中经一月十六日、二月五日到三月二十六日这几个月的苦心编排涂抹起来的，他指望披挂了它们粉墨登台。正如他给舒芜的信所描画的策略，“这中间，得挤出一篇八股文。人生短促，这不晓得是命运开的什么玩笑。然而，只得‘忍受’。要做商人，只得和对手一道嫖赌，要在这圈子里站着不倒下，也就不得不奉陪一道跳加官！”在过去戏里的跳加官常是带上纸做的白发老翁的假面具出场的，最后却以小旦扮演的美女露出真面孔。既然“对手”“命运”要和胡风 “开”“玩笑”，他又要“站着不倒下”也只好带上假面具，权且赌博一番，欺弄一下看客们。
    胡风雕琢的这篇八股文，从破题、起讲到末股，都尽其能事地描写了一个“革命”人物的“一个大的意志贯穿了中国”的不平凡的曲折道路。逻辑是非常之好看的三部曲。
    他的第一部曲是这样的：
    我胡风虽然在“看法”上有些偏差或缺点，即在某些问题上认识不大明确，不大突出，但是我二十年来却是一贯“追求”马克思主义的。
    我胡风虽然在“实践”问题上有些偏狭，有些缺欠政治性，但是从我的二十年的革命“战斗精神”看来，我还“是一个站在党底周围”受党领导的“文学工作的组织者”。
    我胡风虽然“情绪”上有时激动些，不健康些，但是从我的二十年对敌友我的“爱爱仇仇”的界限分明的态度看来，我是一个对革命对人民对党“知无不言，毫无顾忌”的敢提意见的勇士。
    接着胡风的“客观环境”论来了，这是他的第二部曲：
    因为“忠于此时此地的实践……”，使我胡风的斗争受了些压迫，然而这是“具体环境”使然的呀！
    谁能在国民党统治区不“受着客观条件和主观情况的限制”呢？我胡风不过因为“自己的处境”有时把“真诚”表现得过分了些而已。如果以为这是和小资产阶级的意识有关，那也是革命队伍中大家彼此相同的普遍现象，你们批判我胡风，我胡风也可以批判你们。
    解放以后，我胡风因受传统的“环境”影响，仍然有些“情绪”没有克服，在“情绪”热的时候，暴躁了一点而已。
    因此，他又来了第三部曲：既然我的缺点的“膨胀”有可原谅的原因，那末你们就应该“从伟大的革命事业”中看到我二十年来的长期英雄工作和“符合党的政治纲领”的精神，以恭维我为原则，而不应从枝节小处和我开“玩笑”呀！
    这那里是“自我批判”！这是十足的自我宣传！
    反党、反人民、反革命的胡风滚开吧！在今天，不管你还要“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”，也不管你要用哭泣包着对抗和人民势不两立，你的反动的欺骗战术是瞒不了人们的。
    胡风反革命的嘴脸和胡适反革命的嘴脸如果有区别，仅在于一条灰色蛇和一条白色蛇之差，灰色的“猛兽”还要混入革命的阵营里，在解放后的东北、天津从事于反革命的开辟工作，以进行破坏社会主义事业的内线活动，这危险性就更令人要提高警惕的。因为胡风是伪装革命以反对革命的大骗子！
    这种骗人的“自我批判”是胡风宣传他二十年的“我的奋斗”，这奋斗的对象原来是指着中国共产党成立以后的政治以至思想领导，即他说的“要动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力，多花一点气力是必要的”。怎样花气力呢，首先是披上马克思主义外衣以宣传唯心论，“论精神底高扬或升华，从这里理解意识形态底独立性，由此以见理想底力量和牺牲精神。……给市侩底唯物主义一个致命的打击。”胡风就是这样“以天下为己任”的“阔气的英雄主义”，来和胡适双双扮演着里应外合的反革命的丑角。
    和胡适在文化上打一个为政治服务的基础相似，胡风说对“（马克思主义）意识形态作战”，不过是“且打滚且作战”的“一种生活方式或实践”，更重要的还在于同党的领导以及“官方”的负责同志、进步作家等，“与阵地共存亡”地斗争；因而他的组织工作就要“争取人”，“联络人”，进行反革命的破坏活动了。
    把胡风的“我的自我批判”的假一套和胡风指示舒芜的战略战术的真一套对照一下吧！法西斯的败絮其中，革命的金玉其外，这是什么样的骗术？
    这里不能不提到一件事，我得罪过胡风这位
  “万物皆备于我”的英雄，原因很简单，就是在一九四五年春，我对于“论主观”做过一次有胡风在座的批评报告。真的如舒芜所揭露的函件，我提到
  “论主观”在历史观点上是来源于布哈林的均衡论，然而这并不足以惹得胡风的“主观战斗精神”反噬我那次善意的劝告，问题是因为我在批评到人生观方面指出了“论主观”和意大利法西斯哲学家培利的野兽般的“行动哲学”完全相同。同时我也说到，“论主观”文中的“斯大林时代”实际上是法西斯主义时代的伪装。这就使得胡风对舒芜说，
  “哲学家们和官们属于前者（即指闷死舒芜）”。现在想来，我当时上当了，因为我在报告中最后说，“我指的是舒芜，至于胡风先生的思想也许和舒芜并不相同”。同时我的经验也证明了舒芜的揭露是真实的，那就是胡风说“我底回答是：要他们写出文章来”，胡风有两次和我逢面，都对我说“请你写出文章来”；胡风说“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”，他真的从我那次报告以后，见面总是微笑，总是握手。然而我当时并不知道他“包着”的东西是什么？舒芜的材料使我领会了不少道理！
    我同意人民日报的编者按语，“胡风应当做剥去假面的工作，而不是骗人的检讨”，“一切愿意改悔的胡风分子站出来批判自己，揭露胡风，重新做人”。人民的等待是有限度的！
