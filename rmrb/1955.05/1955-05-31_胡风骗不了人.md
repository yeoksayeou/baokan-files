　　Hu Feng Can't Deceive People
　　Sha Ting

    The "People's Daily" published Hu Feng's self-criticism article "My Self-Criticism" on May 13th.

    Any reader with a clear mind, after reading Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and then reading Mr. Shu Wu's "Some Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the same newspaper, will immediately see that this is not a self-criticism, but another act of deception by Hu Feng against the Party and the people.

    The matter is clear: Hu Feng realized that the cloak of Marxism-Leninism no longer served to conceal him, so he transformed himself and put on another cloak, that of a revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectual, in order to continue deceiving the Party and the people and continue his conspiratorial activities. Because Hu Feng knew that the Party and the people have always cherished revolutionary intellectuals and treated them as friends, he thought he had found a loophole here.

    But Hu Feng's false self-criticism cannot deceive people! Because, as the "People's Daily" editor's note pointed out: "Can readers smell even a trace of revolutionary flavor from those letters Hu Feng wrote to Shu Wu?" I believe that no one with a keen sense of smell can smell it! But it is easy to smell another kind of odor: a reactionary, inhumane, dirty odor!

    I ask you, where have we seen or heard of such revolutionary intellectuals: full of hatred and contempt, regarding the Party as "officialdom," "enemies"; regarding the Party's responsible comrades in literature and art as "officials," "powerful figures"; regarding all progressive writers as "philistines," "maggots"; comparing participation in progressive literary and art social activities to accompanying prostitutes and watching gambling and "dancing the added official"; even insulting Mr. Wen Yiduo's progress, who sacrificed under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, as "opportunism"? I believe that no one would admit that such a fellow is a revolutionary intellectual!

    The essence of Hu Feng's bourgeois idealism has become very clear to those who value this ideological struggle after months of criticism and exposure. At the same time, everyone has a certain understanding of the difference and boundaries between the Hu Feng clique and ordinary small circles that form a literary and artistic faction simply because of similar artistic views. However, after reading the materials exposed by Mr. Shu Wu, we have more reason to say this: The Hu Feng clique is an anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy group.

    This anti-Party and anti-people Hu Feng conspiracy group has long hated the Chinese Communist Party and all progressive forces. Its clear goal is to conspire to seize the Party's leadership in literature and art, and to sabotage the people's revolutionary cause and socialist construction cause from this front. The head of this conspiracy group, Hu Feng, also has a whole set of strategies and tactics. Please take a look at what kind of vicious means Hu Feng used to treat progressive forces: "Injuring them without leaving visible scars"!

    The means of the individualistic ambitionist Hu Feng are full of conspiratorial nature. He instigated his confidants to "first become masters, and then fight against themselves who have become masters." He is also accustomed to using "tactics." When he believes there is an opportunity, in the attack on the Party and Marxism, "in order to seize the banner," he will encourage his lackeys to "walk while bleeding"! Encourage them to "coexist with the position"; if he thinks the "enemy" is strong, he will "perfunctorily deal with them," "play dead," he will "wrap insults in smiles and shake hands with them."

    Hu Feng's thought has a considerable and far-reaching influence in Sichuan, which is a well-known fact to cultural figures in Sichuan. I hope that those friends who have had direct contact with Hu Feng will boldly expose Hu Feng's past and present conspiratorial activities, which will be beneficial to the Party, the people, and themselves. At the same time, I also hope that those friends who have only been influenced by Hu Feng's thought will actively participate in the struggle to criticize Hu Feng's thought and seriously draw a clear line with Hu Feng ideologically!

    It is also a well-known fact to people in the cultural circles of Sichuan that Hu Feng is a representative to the National People's Congress elected by Sichuan. Before Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial activities were exposed, it was completely understandable that we elected him; but today, what reason do we have to let him continue to be a representative?

    Allowing an anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary ambitionist to be a representative to the National People's Congress is incompatible with the fundamental spirit of our country and violates the wishes of the people. I suggest that the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress in accordance with the law!

　　胡风骗不了人
　　沙汀
    “人民日报”五月十三日发表了胡风的检讨文章“我的自我批判”。
    任何一个头脑清醒的读者，看了胡风的“我的自我批判”以后，再看一看同一张报纸上发表的舒芜先生的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，都会立刻看出，这不是什么检讨，这是胡风又一次对党对人民的新的欺骗勾当。
    事情是明明白白的：胡风看出马克思列宁主义这件外衣，已经对他不发生隐蔽作用了，于是摇身一变，另外披上一件革命的小资产阶级知识分子的外衣，以便继续欺骗党和人民，继续进行他的阴谋活动。因为胡风知道，党和人民对于革命的知识分子，是一贯爱护的，一贯当成朋友看的，他自以为从这里发现了一个空子。
    但是胡风的假检讨是骗不了人的！因为正如“人民日报”编者按语中所提示的：“读者从胡风写给舒芜的那些信上，难道可以嗅得出一丝一毫的革命气味来吗？”我相信，任何一个嗅觉灵敏的人，也嗅不出来的！但却很容易嗅出另外一种气味：一种反动的非人性的肮脏气味！
    试问，我们在那里看见、听见过这样的革命知识分子：充满仇恨和轻蔑地把党看作“官方”、“敌人”；把党在文艺方面的负责同志看成“官们”，“权贵”；把一切进步作家当成“市侩”、
  “蛆虫”；把参加进步文艺界的社会活动比之为陪嫖看赌和“跳加官”；甚至侮蔑牺牲在国民党反动统治下的闻一多先生的进步为“投机”？我相信，没有一个人肯承认这样一个家伙会是革命的知识分子！
    胡风思想的资产阶级唯心论的实质，经过几个月来的批判、揭露，对于重视这一次思想斗争的人说来，已经很明确了。同时，胡风集团之不同于一般仅仅由于艺术见解相同而自成一个文学艺术派系的小圈子，这中间的区别、界限，大家也都有了一定认识。但是，看了舒芜先生揭发的材料，我们更加有理由这样说了：胡风集团是一个反党反人民的阴谋集团。
    这个反党反人民的胡风阴谋集团，是老早就仇恨中国共产党和一切进步力量的，它的明确的目标，就是阴谋夺取党在文艺方面的领导，从这个战线来破坏人民革命事业和社会主义建设事业。这个阴谋集团的头子胡风，还有他一整套战略战术。请大家看一看胡风是用怎样一种毒狠手段对待进步力量的：“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”！
    个人主义野心家胡风的手段带有充分的阴谋性质。他唆使他的心腹“先变成老爷们，再来和变成了老爷们的自己作战”。他也惯会使用“策略”。当他认为有机可乘时，在向党和马克思主义的进攻中，“为了把大旗抓到手里”，他会鼓动他的走卒“一面流血一面走吧”！鼓动他们“与阵地共存亡”；如果认为“敌人”强大，他会“敷衍”，“装死”，他会“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”。
    胡风思想在四川有相当深远的影响，这是四川文化界人士所共知的事实。我希望那些同胡风有过直接联系的朋友，要大胆揭露胡风过去和现在的阴谋活动，这对党、对人民、对自己都是有益的。同时我还希望那些仅仅受过胡风思想影响的朋友，积极参加批判胡风思想的斗争，认真在思想上同胡风划清界限！
    这也是四川文化界人所共知的事实：胡风是四川选出来的全国人民代表大会的代表。在胡风反党反人民的阴谋活动没有暴露以前，我们选他，这是完全可以理解的；但是到了今天，我们有什么理由能够让他继续当代表呢？
    让一个反党、反人民、反革命的野心家当全国人民代表大会的代表，是和我们国家的根本精神不相容的，是违反人民愿望的。我建议四川省人民代表大会依法撤销胡风全国人民代表大会的代表资格！（原载“四川日报”）
