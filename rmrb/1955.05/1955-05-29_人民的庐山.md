　　The People's Lushan
　　By our correspondent Sun Zunian
    Lushan is located in the north of Jiangxi Province, towering between Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River. The scenery here is beautiful, and the climate is cool (not exceeding 88 degrees Fahrenheit even during the hottest times), making it a famous summer resort in our country.
    Leaving Jiujiang City by car, in less than half an hour, you enter the winding mountain road. The road surface is flat and solid, and there are cement benches built along the way to guide the car when driving in the clouds. This is the mountain road built after liberation, more than thirty kilometers long, with more than one hundred and seventy mountain bends. Before liberation, when the traitor Chiang Kai-shek went to Lushan for summer, he used the excuse of building a mountain road and collected road tolls from the people countless times, but until liberation, there were only a few rugged mountain roads. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government decided to build a mountain road. Surveying was conducted in 1952, and construction began in November of the same year. In just nine months, on August 1, 1953, the winding mountain road, like a silver snake, was opened to traffic. Since then, working people coming to the mountains for rest and recuperation can take large and small buses from Jiujiang City and safely reach Guling, the center of Lushan, which is more than 1,300 meters above sea level, in less than two hours.
    The streets of Guling are not very large, but they are all buildings, with various businesses and handicrafts. After liberation, a large-scale department store, grain supply station, and supply and marketing cooperative were also established. In the summer, the streets and shops are crowded with people coming to the mountains for rest and recuperation in the afternoons and evenings.
    The area around Guling is a worker's rest and recuperation area, with garden-like villas everywhere. When you stand on the peak of Guling, you can clearly see countless red roofs and gray-white and blue windows dotted among the green trees. Since liberation, these beautiful houses have changed their owners; they are labor models and advanced producers, combat heroes, and model workers from all over the country.
    Now, every summer, tens of thousands of labor models and advanced producers come to the mountains for summer vacation and recuperation. Last year, more than 16,000 people from 63 units came to the mountains for rest and recuperation. From 1952 to 1954, the Central South China Workers' Sanatorium (now renamed Jiangxi and Hubei Workers' Sanatorium) has received fourteen groups of 2,576 labor models from factories and mines in various provinces and cities in Central South China.
    The beautiful Lushan has returned to the embrace of the people, and the working people have become the masters of Lushan. In the past few years, Lushan's appearance has been completely renewed and built more beautifully.
    Flowers, grasses, and gardens have also been cultivated on some bare mountains. The newly built hydropower plant can supply lighting and water for 20,000 to 30,000 people throughout the mountain. When you come to Lushan in spring and summer, you will see green trees and blooming flowers everywhere. In the evening, the lights in the rest and recuperation areas around Guling, on the mountains and down the mountains, sparkle like summer fireflies, and the night view of Lushan is also beautiful.
    Lushan now has a large-scale library with more than 100,000 books, a Xinhua Bookstore, a cultural station, and a broadcasting station. People on rest and recuperation can see various newspapers and magazines in time and listen to various programs broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. In addition to the entertainment venues of various sanatoriums, tennis courts, volleyball courts, lighted ball courts, small dance floors, clubs, and swimming pools have also been newly built throughout Lushan for the entertainment of those on rest and recuperation. Every summer, the Jiangxi Provincial Gan Opera Troupe, Drama Troupe, and Film Team come to the mountains in batches to perform and show movies for the workers who are resting and recuperating.
      The summer of 1955 has arrived, and the management staff and workers of Lushan have completed various preparations to welcome the worker comrades who come to the mountains for rest and recuperation. All the houses have been repainted, grain, flour, vegetables, and fruits have been prepared, and seven tea pavilions have been established. The roads and bridges in the scenic area have also been renovated. The Lulin Bridge leading to the Hanpokou scenic area will soon be completed. An artificial lake will appear in the waist of Lulin Mountain, which is more than 1,200 meters above sea level. This summer, the worker comrades who come to the mountains for rest and recuperation will be able to row boats and swing freely in the lake. (Attached picture)

　　人民的庐山
　　本报记者　孙祖年
    庐山在江西省北部，耸立在鄱阳湖和长江之间。这里风景优美，气候凉爽（最热时也不超过华氏八十八度），是我国著名的避暑胜地。
    坐汽车由九江市出发，不到半小时，就进入蜿蜒的登山公路，路面平坦而坚固，沿途还筑有一条一条的水泥石凳，为汽车在云雾中行驶时指引方向。这是解放后修筑起来的登山公路，全长三十多公里，有一百七十多处山弯。解放前卖国贼蒋介石在庐山避暑时，曾经借口修建登山公路，不知向人民收了多少次修路费，但一直到解放，还只是几条崎岖不平的山路。解放后，党和人民政府决定修筑登山公路，一九五二年进行勘测，同年十一月开工，仅九个月的时间，到一九五三年八月一日，蜿蜒如银蛇的登山公路通车了。从此，来山休养的劳动人民，坐着大小客车从九江市出发，不到两小时，就可安全到达海拔一千三百多公尺的庐山的中心——牯岭。
    牯岭的街道不太大，但都是楼房，有各种商业和手工业，解放后还建立了规模较大的百货公司、粮食供应站和供销合作社。在夏季里，每到下午和晚间，街道上，商店里，挤满了来山休养的人们。
    牯岭周围是工人休养和疗养的区域，到处是一座一座的花园似的别墅。当你站在牯岭山峰上，可以清楚地看见在绿色的树林中点缀着无数红色的屋顶和灰白色、蓝色的窗户。解放以来，这些漂亮的房屋，已经换了新的主人，他们是来自全国各地的劳动模范和先进生产者，战斗英雄和模范工作者。
    现在每年夏季成千上万的劳动模范和先进生产者来山避暑、休养。去年上山休养的有六十三个单位的一万六千多人。中南区工人休养所（现改为江西、湖北工人休养所）自一九五二年至一九五四年已接待了十四批来自中南各省、市工厂矿山的劳动模范二千五百七十六人。
    美丽的庐山回到人民的怀抱，劳动人民成了庐山的主人。几年来庐山面貌已焕然一新，建设得更美丽了。
    过去一些光秃的山地上，也培植了花草和园林，新建起来的水电厂，可供应全山二、三万人的照明和用水，当你春夏季到庐山，到处绿树成荫，百花盛开，晚间，牯岭周围的山上山下的休养和疗养区域内的电灯，像夏季萤火似的闪闪发光，庐山上的夜景也是美丽的。
    庐山现在有规模巨大的图书馆，藏书十万多册，有新华书店、文化站、广播站，休养人员能够及时地看到各种报纸、杂志，听到中央人民广播电台播送的各种节目。除了各休养所的娱乐场以外，全庐山还新建了供休养人员娱乐的网球场、排球场、灯光球场、小型跳舞场、俱乐部和游泳池。每当夏季，江西省赣剧团、话剧团和电影队，分批上山为休养的工人同志们演出和放映电影。
      一九五五年的夏季来到了，庐山的管理人员、工人们已经完成了各种准备工作，迎接来山休养的工人同志们。所有的房屋都粉刷一新，粮、面、菜蔬和水果都准备齐全，又建立了七个茶亭。风景区内的道路、桥梁也已重新修整。通往含鄱口风景区的卢林大桥很快就要完工了。在拔海
  一千二百多公尺的卢林山腰中，将出现一片人工湖，今年夏季来山休养的工人同志们，将可以划着小船在湖中自由地荡漾。（附图片）
