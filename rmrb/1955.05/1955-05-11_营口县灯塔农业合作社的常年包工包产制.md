The Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangmattai Village, District One, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, experimented with a short-term contract system in 1952, implemented a seasonal contract system in 1953, and further implemented a permanent contract production system in 1954 based on the experience gained from the previous two years of contracting.

How to Contract

First, divide the fields into permanent, fixed production teams with fixed work areas. In addition to the cooperative director, accountant, and eight various professional personnel, all labor was organized into four field production teams (mixed-gender teams, divided into groups). All land in the cooperative was divided into four work areas and assigned to each team for year-round responsibility. Existing vehicles, horses, and agricultural tools were allocated to each production team for use and responsible safekeeping.

Second, formulate annual production plans and yield-increasing technical measures, and implement contracted production. The crops contracted to each team for year-round cultivation include cotton, sorghum, soybeans, millet, and peanuts, accounting for 93.3% of the cooperative's total sown area. Other crops were not contracted to the teams due to their scattered acreage. The management committee is responsible for ensuring the timely supply of production materials (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) to each team.

Third, formulate work quotas and implement year-round contracting. Detailed work quotas and quality requirements have been established for over 90% of the farm work for the five contracted crops, and a piece-rate payment system is implemented. The total number of workdays for the whole year is contracted to each production team according to the labor-day payment plan. Each team calculates labor days based on the work quotas completed by the members according to the plan.

Fourth, stipulate reward and punishment measures. If production is increased due to careful cultivation, 80% of the increased portion will be distributed to the production team based on labor days, and the remaining 20% will be distributed to all laborers in the cooperative. If production is reduced due to poor cultivation, the percentage of the reduction will be deducted from the team's labor days by the same percentage. If production is reduced due to irresistible natural disasters or special reasons, no labor days will be deducted.

The Effectiveness of Contract Production

After the Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented contract production, cooperative cadres and all members actively sought ways to increase production. In addition to cultivating the main crops well last year, each team also carried out the cultivation of double-season crops. The four production teams planted a total of 49.4 mu of potatoes (under-planted with sorghum and soybeans) and more than 20 mu of garlic (under-planted with sorghum), increasing revenue by more than 5,000 yuan. Labor efficiency has also been greatly improved. Cooperative members said: "In the past, work was finding people; now, people are finding work." Members go to the fields to work before dawn every day. No team wants to fall behind. The phenomenon of idling and wasting labor has been greatly reduced, and 95% of the cooperative's semi-labor force has participated in production.

Conditions for Contract Production

Permanent contract production is a relatively advanced system of production responsibility, which has a great effect on improving labor enthusiasm and creativity; however, because it is more difficult to implement, it is generally only suitable for old cooperatives with a large number of households and experience in contracting. The Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative's successful implementation of permanent contract production is mainly due to the following conditions: (1) A large number of households and laborers, which allows for the division of teams and areas for year-round continuous operation. The cooperative has 69 member households, 111 laborers, more than 700 mu of land, and a large number of livestock and agricultural tools, providing the material basis for year-round area operations. (2) A strong backbone. The cooperative has 13 Party members, 14 Youth League members, and 14 technical experts, with more than half of the male laborers being activists. This is a strong guarantee for the implementation of permanent contract production. (3) The management committee has accumulated several years of "contracting" experience and can accurately assess work quotas; the cooperative director has generally explored the experience of leading teams; and the production team leader has the ability to lead the production team in independent production. (4) Members have developed the habit of contracting and the desire for contracted production; in particular, political work is good, and members have a certain level of ideological awareness. When the initial trial quota was set, it was repeatedly corrected due to inaccurate quotas, but the members' morale was still very high; when formulating the production increase plan, the members did not show fatigue or complaints even after holding meetings for almost a month.

Correctly Divide Field Production Teams

The production team is the basic production unit of the agricultural production cooperative and the main link for rationally allocating labor and realizing the production plan. In order to ensure the implementation of the contract production system, it is necessary to correctly divide the production teams. The Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative paid attention to the following points when dividing the production teams: (1) Appropriately distribute all 13 Party members, 14 Youth League members, 7 management committee cadres, and backbone members to each production team, so that they can become the core of each team and assist the team leader in carrying out the work. (2) In addition to appropriately equipping members with experience in agricultural technology, the 14 technical experts were also assigned to each production team, so that each team could guarantee the implementation of the production technology measures required by the cooperative. (3) In order to facilitate women's participation in production, a method of mixed-gender teams and separate groups was adopted. In this way, women can work independently in cotton fields, and men and women can work together in grain fields, adapting to the needs of production. (4) Correctly selecting the production team leader is the decisive key to improving the team's leadership. The captain of the production team in this cooperative is generally an experienced old peasant with leadership ability; the vice-captain is generally a young person who accepts new things quickly and has a certain level of education. The vice-captain also serves as the team's work recorder.

Appropriately Divide Cultivation Areas

Appropriately dividing cultivation areas and allocating production materials is an important factor in ensuring the implementation of contract production and increasing yields. This cooperative paid attention to the following points in dividing cultivation areas and allocating production materials: (1) In addition to taking into account the concentration of contiguous land to fully exert the production efficiency of large areas of land, the land allocated to each team also took into account the balanced allocation of land area and soil quality of each production team. (2) For the main crop—cotton—because it requires a lot of labor and complex technology, the area assigned to each team was roughly the same, avoiding the phenomenon of uneven workload among the teams. (3) Iron-wheeled carts, livestock, and large agricultural tools are generally evenly distributed to each team. Rubber-wheeled carts and animal-drawn agricultural tools are uniformly allocated by the management committee. Small agricultural tools such as hoes and sickles are provided, repaired, and kept by the members themselves. (4) Agricultural production investment is, in principle, allocated according to the production needs of each team; for various production investments on the same crop, special attention is paid to the balanced allocation among the teams.

Accurately Stipulate Quotas and Implement Piece-Rate Payment

Accurately stipulating work quotas and implementing piece-rate payment is an important guarantee for improving labor enthusiasm and realizing the permanent contract production system. In this cooperative, 81% of the farm work for the five main crops under permanent contract cultivation is paid individually by the piece; 10.2% of the farm work is paid collectively by the piece; and only 8.8% of the farm work is "fixedly divided and flexibly evaluated." In this way, the phenomenon of egalitarianism in labor remuneration is basically overcome. The quota is stipulated based on the amount of work that a medium-to-upper laborer can complete in a day with faithful labor and ensuring a certain quality, as a labor quota. The basic unit of the quota is calculated according to the different types of farm work, in mu, bundles, jin, ridges, carts, stacks, etc. For example, picking 50 jin of cotton, cutting 450 bundles of sorghum, and plowing 1.444 mu of sorghum stubble each counts as one quota. It must be thoroughly calculated by the management committee and the team leader meeting, and finally approved by the members' congress before it can be implemented. Labor remuneration is divided into six levels according to the different seasons, workloads, work importance, and technical complexity of the whole year's farm work, and then the labor-day remuneration that should be obtained for one work quota for each level of farm work is stipulated. For example, the lowest level of farm work—pulling large weeds during the hoeing period—earns 0.5 labor days (5 points) for completing one quota. By analogy, each higher level increases by 0.1 labor days (1 point), and the highest level of farm work, such as hoeing and cutting land, earns one labor day (10 points). In addition, specific quality requirements and work-recording methods for completing each piece of farm work are stipulated, so that the quality of various farm work can be continuously improved.

Strengthen Political and Ideological Leadership

To implement the contract production system, it is also necessary to constantly strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the members. In the early stage of implementing the contract production system in the Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative, some cadres and Party members had blindly optimistic and leisurely emotions, thinking that all kinds of farm work were the responsibility of others, and the responsibility of the leading cadres could be reduced, so they relaxed political and ideological leadership for a time. Unexpectedly, various problems arose not long after the implementation of contract production. When preparations for spring plowing began, there was competition for manure and manure stealing among the teams. During drought-resistant sowing, the four production teams competed for water. The first team secretly blocked the water inlets of the second and third teams and diverted the water to their own land. When plowing the land, the first team's land was not completed on time, but none of the other three teams went to support them. The members cherished the agricultural tools kept in the team, but they did not cherish the agricultural tools and public property that did not belong to the team. These facts educated the Party members and cadres, making them realize that the implementation of permanent contract production not only did not reduce the leadership responsibility, but also made the leadership responsibility even greater, and it was necessary to strengthen not only planning but also political and ideological work. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the Party branch and management committee of this cooperative conducted ideological education through criticism and self-criticism, praised the good, criticized the bad, and gradually improved the collective spirit of the members, so that the above-mentioned problems were initially resolved.

    营口县灯塔农业合作社的常年包工包产制
    辽宁省营口县一区望马台村灯塔农业生产合作社，在一九五二年就试行了短期包工制，一九五三年实行了季节包工制，一九五四年根据前两年包工取得的经验，进一步实行了常年包工包产制。
    怎样包法
    第一、划分常年固定的田间生产队，固定作业区。这个社除了社主任、会计和各种专业人员八人外，全体劳力共编成了四个田间生产队（男女混合编队，分别划组）。全社土地划成四个作业区，分给各队常年负责耕作。现有的车马、农具分配给各生产队使用和负责保管。
    第二、制定全年生产计划和增产技术措施，实行包产。常年包给各队耕种的有棉花、高粱、大豆、谷子、花生等五种作物，占全社总播种面积的百分之九十三点三。其他作物因面积零星没有包给各队。按照全年生产计划指标，分配给各队各种作物“播种面积”和“产量”。管理委员会负责保证及时供给各队生产资料（籽种、肥料、农药等）。
    第三、制定工作定额，实行常年包工。已包产的五种作物百分之九十以上的农活都制定了详细的工作定额和质量要求，实行计件取酬制。并根据劳动日支付计划将全年用工总数包给各生产队。各队按照计划根据社员完成的工作定额计算劳动日。
    第四、规定奖惩办法。因精耕细作而增产的，增产部分的百分之八十归本生产队按劳动日分配，其余百分之二十分配给全社劳力。因耕作不好而减产的，减产百分之几就从本队应得的劳动日当中扣除百分之几。如遇不可抗拒的自然灾害或特殊原因而减产，不扣劳动日。
    包工包产的成效
    灯塔农业生产合作社实行包工包产以后，社干部和全体社员都主动想办法增加生产。去年各队除种好了主要作物外，还进行了二季作物的栽培，四个生产队共种了土豆四十九点四亩（下槎是高粱、大豆），大蒜二十多亩（下槎是高粱），共增加收入五千多元。劳动效率也大大提高了。社员们说：过去干活是活找人，现在干活是人找活。每天天不亮社员就下地干活，那个队也不甘落后，窝工、浪费工的现象大大减少了，全社百分之九十五的半劳力都参加了生产。
    包工包产的条件
    常年包工包产是一种比较高级的生产专责制度，对提高劳动积极性、创造性有很大作用；但因为它实行起来比较困难，一般地只适用于户数较多、包工有了经验的老社。灯塔农业生产合作社实行常年包工包产比较成功，主要由于具备了这些条件：（一）户数、劳力较多，可以进行分队、分区常年连续作业。这个社有社员六十九户，一百一十一个劳动力，七百多亩土地，牲畜、农具较多，具备了常年分区作业的物质基础。（二）骨干力量较强。全社有十三名党员，十四名团员，十四名技术能手，有占男劳力半数以上的积极分子。这是实行常年包工包产的有力保证。（三）管理委员会积累了几年“包工”的经验，能够较准确地评定工作定额；社主任一般地摸索到了分队领导的经验；生产队长有领导生产队独立生产的能力。（四）社员有了包工习惯和包产的要求；特别是政治工作较好，社员有一定的思想觉悟。开始试验定额时，因定额不准曾反复改正，但社员情绪还是很高；制定增产计划的时候，差不多开了一个来月的会议，社员也没有表现疲倦和抱怨。
    正确划分田间生产队
    生产队是农业生产合作社的基本生产单位，是合理调拨劳动力、实现生产计划的主要环节。为了保证包工包产制的贯彻执行，必须正确地划分生产队。灯塔农业生产合作社在划分生产队时，主要注意了以下几点：（一）把全社十三名党员，十四名团员，七名管理委员会干部和骨干分子，适当地分配到各个生产队，使他们成为各个队的核心，协助队长开展工作。（二）除把在农业技术上有经验的社员作了适当配备外，还把十四名技术能手分配到各生产队，使各队能够保证实施社所要求的生产技术措施。（三）为了便于妇女参加生产，采取了妇女和男子混合编队、单独划组的办法。这样，在棉田内妇女可以单独干活，在粮田内男女可以混合干活，适应了生产的需要。（四）正确地选定生产队长是健全队的领导的决定关键。这个社的生产队的正队长一般是生产上有经验、有领导能力的老农民；副队长一般是接受新事物较快又有一定文化程度的青年人。副队长兼队的记工员。
    恰当划分耕作区
    恰当地划分耕作区和分配生产资料是保证包工包产的实施和提高产量的重要因素。这个社在划分耕作区和分配生产资料上注意了如下几点：（一）分配给各队的土地除了照顾到集中连片，以充分发挥大片土地的生产效能外，还照顾到各个生产队土地面积和土质好坏的均衡搭配。（二）对于主要作物——棉花，因费工多，技术复杂，分配时使各队负担面积大体相差不多，避免了各队间忙闲不均的现象。（三）铁轮大车、牲畜和大型农具，一般都平均分配给各队。胶皮轮大车和马拉农具由管理委员会统一调拨。锄头、镰刀等小农具由社员自备、自修、自己保管。（四）农业生产投资原则上是根据各队的生产需要进行分配；对于同种作物上的各种生产投资，特别注意各队间的分配平衡。
    准确规定定额、实行按件计酬
    准确规定工作定额、实行按件计酬是提高劳动积极性、实现常年包工包产制的重要保证。这个社常年包耕的五种主要作物有百分之八十一的农活实行了个人计件；有百分之十点二的农活实行了集体计件；只有百分之八点八的农活实行“死分活评”。这样，就基本上克服了劳动报酬上的平均主义现象。定额的规定是以一个中上劳力，忠实劳动一天，保证一定质量，所能完成的工作数量，作为一个劳动定额。定额的基本单位是按各种农活的不同，以亩、捆、斤、垄、车、堆等来计算的。如拣棉花五十斤、割高粱四百五十捆、刨高粱槎子一亩四分四厘，各为一个定额。必须经过管理委员会和队长会议的周密计算，最后由社员大会讨论通过，才能执行。劳动报酬是先把全年农活根据季节闲忙、工作轻重、技术繁简等不同，共分为六级，然后规定出各级农活一个工作定额应得的劳动日报酬。例如最低级的农活——挂锄期拔大草，完成一个定额，记零点五个劳动日（五分）。以此类推，每高一级增记零点一个劳动日（一分），最高级的农活如锄地、割地等活记一个劳动日（十分）。此外，还规定出完成每件农活的具体质量要求和记工办法，这样就能保证各种农活质量不断提高。
      加强政治思想领导
      实行包工包产制度，还必须经常不断地加强对社员的政治思想领导。灯塔农业生产合作社实行包工包产制初期，某些干部和党员曾发生了盲目乐观和消闲的情绪，认为各种农活都有人负责了，领导干部的责任可以减轻了，因此一度放松了政治思想领导。没想到实行包工包产后不久，就发生了各种各样的问题。当开始准备春耕工作的时候，各队间发生了争夺粪肥和偷粪的现象，在抗旱播种时，四个生产队互相争水，第一队偷着把第二、三队的水口堵上，把水引到自己的地里去。趟地时，第一队的地没有按时完成，但是另外的三个队那一队也不去支援。社员们对队内保管的农具很爱护，对不属于队内的农具和公共财产就不爱护。这些事实教育了党员和社干部，使他们认识到了实行常年包工包产，不但没有减轻领导责任，而且领导责任更加重大了，不仅要加强计划性，而且要加强政治思想工作。这个社的党支部和管理委员会在上级党委的领导下，通过批评和自我批评，进行思想教育，表扬好的，批评坏的，逐步提高了社员的集体主义思想，这样上述各种问题就初步地得到了解决。
