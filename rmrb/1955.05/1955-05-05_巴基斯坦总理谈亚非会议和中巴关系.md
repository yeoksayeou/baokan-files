Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 4th. Pakistani Prime Minister Ali made a radio broadcast on the 1st. He said: The Asian-African Conference provided a valuable opportunity to meet with senior politicians from twenty-eight countries. I had beneficial talks with many of them, especially my friendly talks with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, which covered a wide range of topics. As a result, we have a better understanding of each other. I hope that this understanding established between us will not only promote friendly relations between Pakistan and China, but also help promote the cause of world peace.
