    Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng
　　Seeing Through Hu Feng's Heart
　　Lao She
    I have known Hu Feng for nearly twenty years, and I should say we are old friends. For twenty years, I always thought his problem was just narrow-mindedness and looking down on everyone.

    After reading Mr. Shu Wu's published "Hu Feng Letters," I realized that Hu Feng was not just narrow-minded, but had ulterior motives. It turns out he regarded people outside his small clique, especially the Communist Party, as enemies! His articles quoted so many famous sayings of Marx, Lenin, and Chairman Mao, yet he wanted to use "iron tendons and leather whips" to violently beat writers within the Party and progressive writers, killing without shedding blood! What kind of heart is this? I can't guess! I can only say, who would think like this except those who have been trained by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents?

    After reading those letters, I realized that Hu Feng was not just looking down on everything, but wanted to suppress the revolution and become a literary tyrant! He doesn't understand Marxism-Leninism at all; "Those who obey me prosper, those who oppose me die" is truly the foundation of his thought and practice! I couldn't understand his articles before; now, from his letters, I understand his heart, an extremely violent and vicious heart! No wonder he always talks about "self-expansion," expanding himself to violently beat others!

    This heart must be thoroughly cleansed, which is what Hu Feng must do today! Abandon all deceptive and fame-seeking tricks, and stop trying to secretly engage in any self-deceiving, face-saving tactics and means, because everyone will no longer be deceived!

    提高警惕，揭露胡风
　　看穿了胡风的心
　　老舍
    我认识胡风已快二十年，应该说是老朋友了。二十年来，我总以为他的毛病不过是心地褊狭，目空一切而已。
    看了舒芜先生发表的“胡风信札”，我才知道原来胡风并不只是心地褊狭，而是别具心肠。原来他把他的小集团以外的人，特别是共产党，都看成敌人啊！他的文章里引证了多少马克思、列宁和毛主席的名言呀，可是他要用“铁筋皮鞭”毒打党内作家和进步作家们，杀人不见血！这是什么心肠呢？我猜不透！我只能说，除了受过美蒋特务训练的人，谁会这么想一想呢？
    看了那些信札以后，我才知道原来胡风并不只是目空一切，而是要镇压革命，去作文坛的暴君！他哪里懂得马克思列宁主义；“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”才真是他的思想与实践的基础！我看不懂他的文章；现在，由他的信札里却看懂了他的心，一颗极端狂暴狠毒的心！怪不得他老说“自我扩张”，扩张自己好毒打别人啊！
    这颗心要彻底洗干净，这就是胡风今天必须作的！放弃一切欺世盗名的骗术，不要再暗中要弄什么自欺欺人、避重就轻的策略与手段了，大家已不会再受欺骗！　（原载光明日报）
