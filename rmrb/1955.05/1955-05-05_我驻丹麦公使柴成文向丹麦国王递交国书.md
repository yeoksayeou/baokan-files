Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th. Copenhagen dispatch: China’s newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Denmark, Chai Chengwen, presented his credentials to King Frederik IX of Denmark on the 3rd.

　　Ambassador Chai Chengwen said in his address when presenting his credentials: Over the past five years, the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Denmark have established connections in economy and culture. For the common interests of the people of our two countries, we hope that this connection can be further consolidated and developed in the future with the joint efforts of both sides. I firmly believe that further developing and consolidating friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Denmark on the basis of peaceful coexistence and equality and mutual benefit not only conforms to the common interests of the people of the two countries, but also benefits the cause of world peace that the people of the world are striving for.
