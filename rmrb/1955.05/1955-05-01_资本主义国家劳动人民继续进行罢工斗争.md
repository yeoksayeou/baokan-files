　　Laboring People in Capitalist Countries Continue to Strike
　  American Workers' Strike Movement Continues to Develop
    American workers continue to strike to demand improved living and working conditions.
    The strike of 50,000 workers at Bell Telephone Company and more than 20,000 workers at Louisville-Nashville Railroad Company, which began in mid-March, is still ongoing. Despite the constant occurrence of worker arrests, these repressive measures have not been able to intimidate the striking workers.
    In New Mexico, an industrial base for manufacturing atomic weapons, 2,500 workers at an important atomic factory went on strike, demanding wage increases and protesting the factory's attempt to reduce paid holidays.
    The strike of nearly 25,000 textile workers that began on April 15 in the New England states is also continuing.
　  British Workers Strike to Fight for Improved Living Conditions
    Many British workers are engaging in and brewing strikes to demand improved living and working conditions.
    On the 25th, 2,000 workers at the Dunlop Rubber and Wheel Company's automobile tire factory in Coventry went on strike to protest the employer's refusal to negotiate holiday pay. The striking workers decided at a rally that if the employer continued to refuse negotiations, they would strike every Monday.
    The strike of 2,600 miners at the "Armstrong" mine near Doncaster, which began on the 20th, was still continuing on the 26th. This strike is part of a general plan by 26,000 miners in the Doncaster coal area to fight for higher wages. The leadership of the Doncaster Miners' Union said that if the government does not consider the miners' demands, the miners will call on all miners in the coal area to strike.
    The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, which has about 70,000 members, has called on all of its members to strike from May 1st in support of their demand for higher wages.
  　West German Laboring People Oppose Capitalists' Cruel Exploitation
    In West Germany, which is pursuing a policy of remilitarization, the living conditions of the laboring people are constantly deteriorating.
    The intensity of workers' labor is being forced to increase without limit, while working conditions have not improved, resulting in an unprecedentedly high accident rate. According to official statistics from Bonn, in 1954, there were 2.2 million cases of injuries and deaths in production and occupational diseases among workers.
    For several years, the average wage of West German workers has been the lowest among Western European countries, and the wage income of more than half of West German workers is not enough to maintain the minimum cost of living. Prices, rents, and taxes are constantly rising. From 1950 to 1954, food prices in West Germany rose by an average of 20 percent. The price of staple foods rose particularly sharply, with black bread rising by 40 percent, flour by 36 percent, and potatoes by 34 percent.
    In 1954, there were 1.25 million unemployed people in West Germany.
    The taxes now paid by West German farmers (an average of 125.4 marks per hectare of land) are fifteen times higher than in 1938-39. The total amount of farmers' debts has increased from 2.5 billion marks in 1948 to 8.5 billion marks at the end of 1954.
    The American and West German authorities have requisitioned 700,000 hectares of land in West Germany for military purposes, which has caused thousands of West German farmers to lose their homes and jobs.
    The laboring people of West Germany are responding to the cruel exploitation of the capitalists with struggle. In 1954, the largest-scale workers' struggle in German history since 1932 broke out in West Germany, with 5 million workers participating in strikes and movements to fight for higher wages. In January 1955, more than one million coal and steel workers held a general strike to defend workers' rights. The strikers also put forward slogans against the Paris Agreements.
　　Seoul Bus Workers Oppose Enslaving Working Conditions
  According to the Korean Central News Agency: All workers in the bus transportation industry in Seoul issued a statement on the 20th, condemning the Syngman Rhee clique for forcing them to work 18 hours a day while paying wages that are too low to feed them, or even not paying wages at all.
    The statement demanded an eight-hour workday and a minimum wage that can guarantee a living.
    The statement said that if this demand is rejected, the bus transportation workers in Seoul will hold a general strike on May 1st.

　　资本主义国家劳动人民继续进行罢工斗争
　  美国工人罢工运动在继续开展着
    美国工人为要求改善生活和劳动条件而继续举行罢工。
    贝尔电话公司五万名工人和路易斯维尔—纳什维尔铁路公司两万多工人自三月中旬开始的罢工，到现在仍在坚持着。尽管不断发生逮捕工人的事件，但是这种镇压措施并没有能吓倒罢工工人。
    在制造原子武器的工业基地新墨西哥州，一重要原子工厂的两千五百名工人举行了罢工，要求增加工资，并且抗议厂方企图减少工资照付的假日。
    四月十五日在新英格兰各州开始的近两万五千名纺织工人的罢工也在继续中。
　  英国工人为争取改善生活条件进行罢工
    许多英国工人为要求改善生活和劳动条件，在进行并且酝酿罢工。
    二十五日，考文垂市“邓禄普轮圈和车轮公司”的汽车轮胎工厂的两千名工人举行罢工，抗议企业主拒绝关于假日工资的谈判。罢工工人在集会上决定：如果企业主继续拒绝谈判，他们将在每星期一举行罢工。
    在敦卡斯特附近的“阿姆斯特朗”矿井的两千六百名矿工从二十日开始举行的罢工，到二十六日为止还在继续进行中。这次罢工是敦卡斯特煤区两万六千名矿工争取提高工资的总计划的一部分。敦卡斯特矿工工会领导机构说，如果政府不考虑矿工的要求，矿工们就要号召这个煤区的所有矿工举行罢工。
    拥有七万左右会员的机车司机司炉联合会已经号召它的全体会员从五月一日开始举行罢工，以支持他们提高工资的要求。
  　西德劳动人民反对资本家的残酷剥削
    在奉行着重新军国主义化政策的西德，劳动人民的生活状况正在不断恶化。
    工人的劳动强度在被迫无限制地加强着，而劳动条件却没有改善，这就使得事故率空前提高。据波恩官方的统计，一九五四年，生产中发生的伤亡事故和工人患职业病的有二百二十万起。
    几年来，西德工人的平均工资额一直是西欧国家中最低的，过半数的西德工人的工资收入不够维持最低限度的生活费用。物价、房租和捐税都在不断上涨。从一九五○年到一九五四年，西德的食品价格平均上涨了百分之二十。主食品上涨得特别厉害，其中黑面包上涨了百分之四十、面粉上涨了百分之三十六、马铃薯上涨了百分之三十四。
    一九五四年西德有一百二十五万失业者。
    西德农民现在所缴纳的税（平均每公顷土地缴税一百二十五点四马克）为一九三八—三九年的十五倍。农民的负债总数已经从一九四八年的二十五亿马克增到一九五四年年底的八十五亿马克。
    美国和西德当局为了军事目的在西德征用了七十万公顷的土地，这使得成千上万的西德农民丧失了家园和工作对象。
    西德劳动人民用斗争来回答资本家的残酷剥削。一九五四年，在西德爆发了自一九三二年以来德国历史上最大规模的工人斗争，有五百万工人参加了罢工和争取提高工资的运动。在一九五五年一月份，有一百多万煤矿和钢铁工人又举行了为维护工人权利而举行的总罢工。罢工者同时提出了反对巴黎协定的口号。
　　汉城公共汽车工人反对奴役性的劳动条件
  据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：汉城的公共汽车运输业的全体工人在二十日发表声明，谴责李承晚集团强迫他们每天工作十八小时，而工资却少得吃不饱饭，甚至根本不发工资。
    声明要求实行八小时工作制和可以保证生活的最低工资。
    声明说，如果这个要求遭到拒绝，汉城的公共汽车运输业工人将在“五一”节举行总罢工。
