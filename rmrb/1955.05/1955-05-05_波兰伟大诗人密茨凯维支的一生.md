The Life of the Great Polish Poet Mickiewicz
Sun Yong
    One hundred years ago, a few days after the death of Poland's greatest poet, Adam Mickiewicz, in Turkey, another Polish poet, Krasinski, exiled in Baden, Germany, wrote this eulogy about him.
    Adam has left us. This news saddens me. For our generation, he was both honey and milk, courage and heart's blood. We all came from him. He is one of the pillars supporting the building, which is built not of stones, but of active, bleeding hearts. This is the voice of the Polish people; at that time, they regarded him not only as a great poet, but also as a great leader. In our country, his name was known nearly fifty years ago thanks to Lu Xun's introduction. He is one of the great international poets.
    Mickiewicz was born on December 24, 1798, in Novogrudok, Lithuania. At that time, it was just after the failure of the Polish uprising of 1794, and Poland was divided by Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Lithuania became a province under the rule of Tsarist Russia. Mickiewicz spent his childhood under the oppression of foreign races. Influenced by his father, he also loved poetry and cared about politics, listening to political debates from an early age and paying attention to news from abroad and from Europe.
    At the age of seventeen, he entered Vilnius University. He and his classmates organized a secret group called the "Society of Friends of Science"; its purpose was: to revive the motherland through learning and morality, through understanding and practicing a noble life; in the poet's words, it was
  "For the motherland, learning and justice." After graduation, they still maintained contact with this group and also organized new groups:
  "The Society of Light," "The Society of Friends of Virtue."
    Mickiewicz often wrote poetry at university, and after graduation, as a middle school teacher, he wrote even more. In 1822 and 1823, he continued to publish two poetry collections, "Ballads and Romances" First Collection and Second Collection. Polish folk songs and stories are very rich. He used the simple and unadorned language of the people to write folk songs and folk tales into beautiful poems. These are the earliest Polish romantic works and works that fought against the then-popular French classicism. These two poetry collections were very popular. He himself later said: "The first edition of five hundred copies of the first volume sold very quickly, and most of the buyers were nannies and servants." However, those rigid critics could not accept it. They either ignored it or attacked it. Among them, some people even wanted to scold him down and wrote a vulgar poem entitled "A Short Poem Can Kill Mickiewicz." Of course, this little poet and his short poem have long been forgotten.
    Because the underground organization of Vilnius University students was very active, the Tsarist government sent officials to Vilnius to suppress it. Mickiewicz and some of his friends were arrested on October 23, 1823, and imprisoned in the former Basilian Monastery prison. Six months of prison life greatly influenced his later life and works. The fearless hero Konrad, who loves his motherland and people, in the third volume of "Forefathers' Eve," published nine years later, was born from this.
    In October 1824, Mickiewicz was exiled to St. Petersburg. In St. Petersburg, he met the future Russian Decembrists: the poet Ryleyev and the writer Bestuzhev, as well as many other Russian friends. Later, he went to Moscow and joined the gatherings of poets and writers, becoming a lifelong friend of Pushkin. The love and respect of his Russian friends deeply moved him. In the years from 1824 to 1829, he wrote many poems; the eighteen "Crimean Sonnets" were novel and very beautiful works in Polish literature; "Konrad Wallenrod" is a historical story poem of Lithuania and Prussia, which is a call to battle. In the poem, the hero Wallenrod sacrifices even his life and his honor for the freedom of the people. These poems were loved by his Russian friends. The "Crimean Sonnets" immediately had two versions, prose and verse, and Pushkin also translated two of his ballads and began to translate "Konrad Wallenrod."
    Mickiewicz left Russia in May 1829 and went to Berlin, then to Prague, where he met the Czech poet Hanka; later he went from Dresden to Weimar to visit Goethe; finally, he went through Switzerland to Rome. It was then that he learned of the Polish uprising. This uprising was launched in Warsaw in November 1830. The Russian army withdrew, and a Polish government was established; the poet set off for Poland, where the Polish people in the Poznan region warmly welcomed him. However, in September 1831, Warsaw still fell, and in October it was completely defeated. As a result, a large number of Polish exiles arrived in Paris from Germany. Mickiewicz felt very painful because he had not fought side by side with them.
    After this great change, he wrote his masterpiece "Forefathers' Eve" Third Volume, recalling his unfortunate love and his prison night. One of his friends said, "In the frenzy of creation, his desk was piled with drafts, and he leaned on them and wrote non-stop for many days, even without time to eat." "Forefathers' Eve" Third Volume is completely different from the Second and Fourth Volumes published earlier in Vilnius. The former was about unfortunate love, while the latter is about sacrifice for the motherland. The hero Konrad in the Third Volume sings his impromptu poem in the prison cell: I and my motherland are one. My name is the public, I love like them, and I suffer like them.
    From November 1832 to February 1834, he wrote "Pan Tadeusz". This is his first masterpiece. He had been away from his motherland for eight or nine years and could not help but miss it passionately. He remembered his childhood; he was proud of the glorious past of his country, and he was also confident in the beautiful future of his country. He saw the shortcomings of his people very clearly, but he also loved them wholeheartedly. The theme of "Pan Tadeusz" is the secret plan of the Lithuanian people to revive their motherland in 1811, and it is also intertwined with the fantasy of the "spring of hope" that made his heart beat when he saw Napoleon's army. Mickiewicz was a realist, and he lived completely in the scenes he described. He wrote to his friend: "Now I am in Lithuania, strolling in the forest, sitting in the hotel with Jews and squires. For this poem, I just want to fly back from Paris." After writing this long poem, Mickiewicz's poetic activities almost stopped, and he devoted himself to social activities. He no longer wrote poetry, but wrote passionate political essays and university lectures. From November 1832 to June 1833, he wrote political essays for the publication "The Polish Pilgrim" published for Polish immigrants. From December 1840 to May 1844, he lectured on Slavic literature at the Collège de France.
    As soon as 1848 began, the storm of revolution in European countries was approaching; Mickiewicz also decided that the time to complete his mission had come. He set off for Rome in January, where he organized an army of only three hundred men to fight for the freedom of Italy and Poland. He also said, "This is an army of republicanism and socialism." In March 1849, he edited a French daily newspaper, "The Tribune of the People," which was forced to cease publication in June; it was later republished in September, but Mickiewicz could only write secretly, and even the manuscripts were copied by others to avoid prohibition. However, in November, it was finally closed by the French government.
    The war between Russia and Turkey broke out in March 1854. Mickiewicz went to Constantinople in September of the following year, striving to organize an army, but unfortunately contracted the cholera epidemic that was prevalent there and died on November 26. At the time of his death, he saw Colonel Kuchinski visiting him. He only said "A band of Turkish Cossacks..." His last words spoke of the whole spirit of his life and his work!
    Mickiewicz not only suffered persecution from foreign races during his lifetime, but also suffered the hatred of domestic reactionaries after his death. They distorted and erased his life and works. It was not until the establishment of a new Poland with democratic freedom that his ideals were realized. In the postscript to "Pan Tadeusz," he said: If I can live to that day, and have such happiness: that my book is actually collected in thatched cottages... If those country girls actually hold in their hands this book that is as clear as their songs! Now, all of his works are not only a valuable legacy of the Polish people, but also a valuable legacy of the people of the world!
    He is one of the cultural celebrities called to be commemorated this year by the World Peace Council. Let us quote here the words spoken six years ago by Comrade Beirut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, to express the respect of our peace-loving people for this great poet and warrior:
    "Mickiewicz is now and will always be very close to the masses of the people, because he knew how to connect ardent patriotism with the struggle for human liberation. He knew this great truth: that sincere love for the motherland is most powerfully expressed in profound, revolutionary internationalism. Mickiewicz was very concerned about social and popular issues. He experienced these issues with the emotions of a poet and a talented artist." (Quoted from the preface to "Selected Poems of Mickiewicz," 1954, Writers Publishing House edition.) (Attached image)

　　波兰伟大诗人密茨凯维支的一生
　　孙用
    一百年前，波兰最伟大的诗人亚当·密茨凯维支在土耳其逝世后不多几天，另一位流亡在德国巴顿的波兰诗人克拉辛斯基写下了关于他的这样的悼词。
    亚当离开我们去了。这消息使我伤心。对于我们这一代的人，他是蜜糖又是牛乳，是胆气又是心血。我们都从他而来。他是支撑着大厦的柱石之一，这大厦不是石块，而是活跃的、流血的心建成的。这是波兰人民的声音；在那时候，他们不但以他为伟大的诗人，而且以他为伟大的领导者的。在我国，由于鲁迅的介绍，在将近五十年前就知道了他的名字。他是伟大的国际诗人之一。
    密茨凯维支在一七九八年十二月二十四日生于立陶宛的诺伏格罗特克。那时正当一七九四年的波兰起义失败之后，波兰被普鲁士、奥地利、俄国瓜分了，立陶宛成了沙皇俄国统治之下的一省。密茨凯维支在异族的压迫之下度过他的儿时，因在父亲的影响下，他也爱好诗歌和关心政治，从小就倾听着政治的辩论，关心着从外国、从欧洲来的消息。
    他在十七岁的时候，进维尔诺大学读书。他和同学们组织了一个秘密的团体，叫做“科学之友社”；它的目的是：以学问和道德，以了解和实行高尚的生活，来复兴祖国；照这诗人的话说来，是
  “为了祖国、学问和正义”。他们在毕业后依然同这个团体保持着联系，而且还组织了新的团体：
  “光社”、“德行之友社”。
    密茨凯维支在大学里常常写诗，毕业后担任中学教师，诗写得更多了。到一八二二和一八二三年继续出版了两本诗集“歌谣和传奇”第一集和第二集。波兰的民歌和故事是非常丰富的，他用了人民的简单朴素的语言，将民歌和民间故事，写成美丽的诗篇，这是最早的波兰浪漫主义的作品，是和当时流行的法国拟古主义作斗争的作品。这两本诗集很受大众欢迎。他自己后来说：“第一卷的初版五百本销得非常快，购买的人大部分是保姆和仆人。”然而那些古板的批评家们却接受不了，他们不是置之不理，就是加以攻击，他们之中还有人想骂倒他，写了一首下流的诗，题目叫做“一首短歌就能杀掉密茨凯维支”。当然，这个小诗人和他的这首短歌，大家早就忘记光了。
    因为维尔诺大学学生的地下组织很活跃，沙皇政府派了官员到维尔诺来镇压。密茨凯维支和他的一些朋友在一八二三年十月二十三日被捕，监禁在原来是巴西尔修道院的监狱里。六个月的监狱生活大大地影响了他以后的生活和创作。他在九年以后发表的“先人祭”第三卷中那一位大勇无畏，热爱祖国和人民的英雄康拉德就是由此产生的。
    一八二四年十月，密茨凯维支被流放到彼得堡去。他在彼得堡结识了俄国的未来的十二月党人：诗人雷列耶夫和作家别斯土舍夫以及别的许多俄国友人。后来他又到了莫斯科，加入诗人和作家的集会，同普希金成了永久的朋友。俄国友人们对于他的热爱和敬重，是使他非常感动的。在一八二四到一八二九的几年间，他写作了不少的诗；“克里米亚十四行诗”十八篇，在波兰文学里是新颕的，又是非常美丽的作品；“康拉德·华伦洛德”是立陶宛和普鲁士的历史故事诗，这是战斗的号召，诗中的英雄华伦洛德为了人民的自由，连自己的生命、自己的荣誉也不惜牺牲。这些诗都为他的俄国友人们所爱好，“克里米亚十四行诗”马上就有散文的和韵文的两种译本，普希金也译了他的两篇歌谣，又开始翻译“康拉德·华伦洛德”。
    密茨凯维支在一八二九年五月间离开俄国，到了柏林，又去布拉格，和捷克诗人汉卡会面；后来就从德累斯顿到魏玛，访问歌德；最后经过瑞士，到了罗马。那时他才知道波兰起义的消息。这一次起义，是一八三○年十一月间在华沙发动的，俄国军队退出了，成立了波兰政府；诗人就动身到波兰去，在波兹南地区的波兰人民热烈地欢迎了他。然而到了一八三一年九月，华沙依然失守，十月间就完全打败了。于是大批的波兰流亡者都从德国到了巴黎。密茨凯维支因为自己没有和他们并肩作战，感到非常痛苦。
    在这巨大的变动之后，他写作他的名著“先人祭”第三卷，他回忆着他的不幸的恋爱和他的狱室之夜。他的一位朋友说，“他在创作的狂热中，书桌上堆满了稿纸，他就靠在上面不停地写着，继续了许多天，连吃饭也没有时间。”“先人祭”第三卷是和以前在维尔诺发表的第二卷和第四卷完全不同的。以前是不幸的爱情，而现在却是为祖国的牺牲。第三卷的英雄康拉德在狱室中唱着他的即兴诗道：我和我的祖国是一个整体。我的名字是大众，我像他们一样爱，我也像他们一样感到痛苦。
    从一八三二年十一月到一八三四年二月，是他写作“塔杜施先生”的时间。这是他的第一部杰作。他离开祖国八九年了，禁不住热烈的怀念，他记起了他的儿时；他以他的国家的光荣的过去自豪，他又确信他的国家的美好的未来。对于他的人民的缺点，他看得十分清楚，然而他也全心全意地爱着他们。“塔杜施先生”的主题是一八一一年立陶宛人民的复兴祖国的秘密的计划，又交织着因见到拿破仑的军队而感到心跳的对于“希望的春天”的幻想。密茨凯维支是写实主义者，他完全生活在他所描写的情景里。他写信给他的朋友说：“现在我是在立陶宛了，在森林里蹓跶，同犹太人和乡绅们一起坐在旅馆里。为了这诗，我只想从巴黎飞回去。”写了这部长诗以后，密茨凯维支的诗歌的活动几乎停止，他全力进行社会活动了。他不再写诗，写的是热烈的政论和大学的讲义。从一八三二年十一月到一八三三年六月，他在为波兰移民刊行的刊物“波兰巡礼者”上写政论，一八三九年起他担任瑞士洛桑大学的拉丁文学讲席，从一八四○年十二月到一八四四年五月，他在法兰西学院讲授斯拉夫文学。
    一八四八年一开始，欧洲各国革命的暴风雨已经逼近；密茨凯维支也决定了：完成他的使命的时间已经来到了。他在一月间就动身到罗马去，他组织了一支不过三百人的军队，为意大利和波兰的自由而作战，他还说“这是一支共和主义和社会主义的军队”。一八四九年三月间，他主编一种法文的日报“人民论坛”，到了六月就被迫停刊；后来在九月间复刊，但密茨凯维支只能秘密地写稿，为了避免禁止，连稿子也由别人抄过。然而到了十一月，它终于被法国政府封闭了。
    俄国和土耳其的战争在一八五四年三月间爆发，密茨凯维支就于第二年九月到君士坦丁堡，努力奔走，组织军队，不料染上了那里正在流行的霍乱症，于十一月二十六日逝世。临终的时候，他看到了来访问他的库钦斯基上校，他只说了“一团土耳其哥萨克兵……”，他的这最后的话正说出了他的生活和他的工作的全副精神！
    密茨凯维支不但在生前遭受异族的迫害，连死后也遭受本国反动派的仇视，他们对于他的生活和作品，都要加以歪曲，加以抹杀。一直到了民主的自由的新波兰成立以后，他的理想这才实现。他在“塔杜施先生”的跋诗里说：假如我能活到那一天，有那样的快乐：我的这书居然收藏在茅屋里了……假如那些乡下姑娘们居然在她们手里捧读着这一本像她们的歌一样明白的书！现在，他的一切作品不光是波兰人民的宝贵的遗产，而且也成了全世界人民的宝贵的遗产！
    他是世界和平理事会号召今年纪念的文化名人之一，让我们在这里引一下波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特同志在六年前说过的话，表示我们保卫和平的人民对于这位伟大的诗人和战士的敬意：
    “密茨凯维支现在是而且将来也永远是与人民大众很密切的，因为他知道将热烈的爱国主义与对于人类解放的努力联结起来。他知道这一伟大的真理：对祖国的真诚的热爱，最有力地表现出深切的、革命的国际主义。密茨凯维支十分关心社会的和人民的问题。他以诗人和天才艺术家的情感体验着这些问题。”（引自“密茨凯维支诗选”的前言，一九五四年，作家出版社版。）（附图片）
