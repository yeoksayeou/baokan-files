The initiative put forward by young workers at the state-owned Shanghai Shipyard recently to carry out activities to collect waste materials and old materials has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of young workers in Shanghai's heavy and light industrial factories.

Many factories' young workers have formulated conservation plans and established systems for regularly carrying out conservation activities. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory's youth conservation shock brigade picked out 3,000 jin of usable materials from waste material packages; the young workers in the factory's technology section cleaned out more than 250 waste and old pallets and are preparing to change their specifications for use. Young workers at the Shanghai Wire Factory have already collected more than 3,800 kilograms of old copper and more than 3,200 kilograms of old iron and old lead. Young people in workshops and offices of the Shanghai Iron and Steel No. 2 Plant collected more than 17,600 jin of scrap steel, more than 300 jin of scrap copper, and many screws within an hour of their off-duty time. These materials are worth more than 1,300 yuan. Young workers at the Shanghai Tool Factory inspected the waste phenomena in production and proposed that in the future, "every inch of steel should be made into precision tools." The Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory established a "Youth Supervision Team" with 400 members of the Communist Youth League and young workers participating. They are now actively launching conservation activities.

In industries such as papermaking, medicine, cigarette making, food, and printing, young workers have exposed and stopped the phenomenon of material waste. Young workers at the Shanghai Glass Factory installed conservation boxes in workshops such as the bottle workshop, and put the forty or fifty jin of broken glass that used to be sent to the garbage every day into the conservation boxes. The young people at the Xinhua Printing Factory scraped out the ink remaining in the empty ink cartridges, and each cartridge can scrape out half a jin to one jin of ink. Workers at the Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory used to throw away more than 1,500 medicine bottles every day during operations, and discarded purple copper pipes, stainless steel, and switches everywhere. This has now been corrected.

　　上海青年职工积极收集废料旧料
    国营上海船舶修造厂青年工人最近提出的开展收集废料、旧料活动的倡议，已经得到上海市重工业和轻工业工厂广大青年职工的热烈响应。
    许多工厂的青年职工订出了节约计划，建立了经常进行节约活动的制度。上海自行车厂的青年节约突击队，从废料包中拣出了可用的材料三千市斤；这个厂技术科的青年职工清理出二百五十多只废、旧卡板，并准备把它们改变规格后使用。上海电线厂青年工人已经收集了旧铜三千八百多公斤，旧铁和旧铅三千二百多公斤。上海钢铁二厂车间和科室的青年，利用下班时间在一小时内就收集了废钢一万七千六百多斤，废铜三百多斤和许多螺丝钉，这些材料共值一千三百多元。上海工具厂青年工人检查了生产上的浪费现象，提出今后“要把每一寸钢制成精密的工具”。上海华通开关厂成立了有四百个青年团员和青年工人参加的“青年监督队”，这几天他们正积极展开节约活动。
    在造纸、医药、卷烟、食品、印刷等行业中，青年职工们纷纷揭发和制止材料的浪费现象。上海玻璃厂的青年工人们在瓶子等车间装置了节约箱，把原来每天送进垃圾里的四、五十斤碎玻璃放到节约箱内。新华印刷厂的青年们把残留在空油墨筒里的油墨刮出，每筒可以刮半斤到一斤油墨。上海第一制药厂的工人，过去在操作中每天要丢掉一千五百多只药瓶，把紫铜管、不锈钢和开关等也到处乱丢，现在已经纠正。
