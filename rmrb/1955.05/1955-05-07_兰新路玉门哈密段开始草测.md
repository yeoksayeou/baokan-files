The preliminary survey work for the Yumen to Hami section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has begun. Employees of the First Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau, who are responsible for this task, are working hard in the Xingxingxia area, the outermost edge of Xinjiang Province. Soon, they will reach Hami, the first county town in eastern Xinjiang Province.

The engineering technicians and workers of the preliminary survey team, responding to the call to "investigate more, travel more, study more, and make more comparative lines," with the enthusiastic support of local Party and government organs and people of all ethnic groups along the route, have traversed the desolate deserts and grasslands, overcoming various difficulties, and persevering in their work. One group, far from the highway, relies on camels to transport drinking water from thirty to forty kilometers away. The team members, who battle the wind and sand all day long, often cannot wash their faces for days. At night, they often cannot sleep well and need to get up to tidy up their tents in the storm. However, the surveying team members are in high spirits. They know that the sooner they submit the survey data, the sooner the train can meet with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

### 兰新路玉门哈密段开始草测

　  兰新路玉门哈密段开始草测
    兰新铁路玉门到哈密段的草测工作已经开始。担负这项任务的西北设计分局第一勘测设计总队的职工，正在新疆省境最边缘的星星峡一带紧张地进行勘测工作。不久，他们就将到达新疆省东面的第一个县城——哈密。
    草测队的工程技术人员和工人们响应了“多调查、多跑路、多研究、多作比较线”的号召，在沿线党政机关和各族人民的热情支援下，穿过荒无人烟的沙漠、草滩，克服各种困难，坚持工作。离公路远的一个组，饮用的水都靠用骆驼到三四十公里以外去驮运。同风沙终日搏斗着的队员们，常常几天不能洗脸。晚上，他们也经常不能安睡，需要起来，在暴风中整理帐篷。但是，勘测队员们的工作情绪都很高。他们知道：早一天交出勘测资料，火车就可以早一天同新疆各族人民见面。
