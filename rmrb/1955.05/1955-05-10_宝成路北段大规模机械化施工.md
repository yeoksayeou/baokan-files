Large-Scale Mechanized Construction on the Northern Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway

　　Large-scale mechanized construction has begun on key projects in the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Currently, over a thousand pieces of various construction machinery, large and small, have been delivered to construction sites along the line; over twenty mechanized tunnel excavation teams have commenced work. Eighty-five percent of the air compressors used for tunnel projects are operational, and seven aerial cableways supplying transportation to the high cliffs have also been installed. Mechanical excavation on both the north and south sides of the Qinling Tunnel allows for a maximum efficiency of three meters per day in pilot tunnel excavation, whereas manual excavation of short tunnels averages just over one meter per day.

　　Construction on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is taking place in mountainous terrain, with an average of more than 40,000 cubic meters of earth and stone per kilometer. Therefore, many key projects utilize mechanical excavation, with eight-tenths of the tunnels being excavated mechanically.

　　宝成路北段大规模机械化施工
    宝成铁路北段的重点工程中开始了大规模的机械化施工。现在，上千台各种大小筑路机械已经送到沿线工地；二十几个隧道机械开挖队都开始了工作。用于隧道工程的空气压缩机有百分之八十五都开动起来，有七条供给高崖间做运输工作的高架索道也安装好了。人们在秦岭隧道南北两面用机械开挖，最高的效率一天可打通导洞三公尺，而用人工开挖的短隧道平均一天只进一公尺多。
    宝成铁路北段在山岳地带施工，平均一公里就有四万多土石方，所以许多重点工程都用机械开挖，有十分之八的隧道都要用机械打通。
