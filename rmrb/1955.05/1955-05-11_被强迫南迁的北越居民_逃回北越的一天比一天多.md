Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Day by day, people are returning to North Vietnam from the chaos of South Vietnam. In just three days, six hundred people arrived in Haiphong, which is about to be liberated, by boat from Saigon. Many of these people were previously forcibly relocated to the South by the Ngo Dinh Diem group. They have come from Haiphong to Hanoi and are preparing to return to their hometowns.

According to those who arrived in Hanoi, the Ngo Dinh Diem group prohibits people from returning to North Vietnam. Only by bribing Ngo Dinh Diem's officials can they get on a boat to Haiphong. Many people brave all kinds of dangers to return to North Vietnam.

Bui Chung Ngoc, who escaped from the military school in Thu Duc, South Vietnam, said that after arriving in South Vietnam, he was conscripted by the Ngo Dinh Diem group into the military school. He said that in South Vietnam, many people cannot bear the painful life in concentration camps and yearn to return to North Vietnam. North Vietnamese residents in the Bien Hoa concentration camp once held a meeting demanding that they be allowed to return to their hometowns, but the Ngo Dinh Diem group sprayed them with machine guns, killing five people on the spot and injuring many more.

Many people who have fled back to North Vietnam have filed complaints with the Vietnam International Commission.

　　被强迫南迁的北越居民
　　逃回北越的一天比一天多
    据新华社讯　每天都有人从混乱的南越回到北越来。在三日一天内，就有六百人从西贡坐船到达快要解放的海防。这些人中有许多人是以前被吴庭艳集团强迫迁移到南部去的，他们已经从海防来到河内，准备重返自己的故乡。
    据到达河内的人说，吴庭艳集团禁止人们回北越，只有向吴庭艳手下的官吏行贿后才能坐上船到海防来。许多人冒着各种危险才回到北越。
    从南越守德地方的军事学校逃出来的裴种玉说，他到南越后就被吴庭艳集团强征到军事学校去。他说，在南越有许多人受不了集中营的痛苦生活，渴望返回北越。在边和集中营里的北越居民曾经开会要求让他们返回故乡，但是吴庭艳集团用机枪向他们扫射，五个人当场被打死，更多人负伤。
    许多逃回北越的人已经向越南国际委员会提出控诉。
