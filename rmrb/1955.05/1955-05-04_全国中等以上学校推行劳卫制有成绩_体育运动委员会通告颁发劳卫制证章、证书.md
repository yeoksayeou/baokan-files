The promotion of the Labor and Defense System in secondary and higher education institutions nationwide has yielded positive results.

State Physical Culture and Sports Commission issues notice on awarding Labor and Defense System Medals and Certificates.

Since the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government announced the "Provisional Regulations and Provisional Item Standards for the Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system (referred to as the Labor and Defense System) on May 4th of last year, by the end of last year, 187 secondary and higher education institutions across the country, excluding the four provinces of Rehe, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Xikang, and the two regions of Inner Mongolia and Tibet, had 127,400 students participating in Level 1 training of the Labor and Defense System. More than 2,360 secondary and higher education institutions with over 1,159,000 students participating in the preparatory level training of the Labor and Defense System.

Since the implementation of the Labor and Defense System, the health of students has greatly improved. Students participating in Labor and Defense System training generally report increased weight, reduced illness, and improved learning efficiency. Many "three good" students have emerged in schools across the country.

After the implementation of the Labor and Defense System, the sports technical level of students has also improved rapidly. More than 400 students at Zhengzhou Electric Power School participated in Labor and Defense System training, and in less than six months, half of the students reached the Level 1 training standard of the Labor and Defense System. At sports meetings held in various places, schools that implemented the Labor and Defense System achieved more prominent results.

The promotion of the Labor and Defense System has also promoted sports teaching reform in schools. Many schools have used the Labor and Defense System as a foundation to compile new teaching materials, change the past erroneous viewpoints and methods of unit-based teaching and solely cultivating a few athletes, and have initially solved the problem of combining physical education classes with the Labor and Defense System, enriching the content of physical education classes and extracurricular activities.

The Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China issued a notice on May 4th regarding the issuance of "Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system (referred to as the Labor and Defense System) medals and certificates.

The notice stated: In order to commend the patriotism shown by those who pass the Labor and Defense System test in sports training, and encourage them to persist in training to better participate in socialist construction and defend the motherland, the Level 1 Labor and Defense System medal and certificate are issued in accordance with Article 19 of the Provisional Regulations of the Labor and Defense System. The notice also pointed out: Obtaining the Level 1 Labor and Defense System medal and certificate indicates that they have received more comprehensive sports education and have prepared certain physical conditions for labor and defense. They should continue to persevere in training and strive to reach the Level 2 standard and improve their sports technical level.

The notice stipulates: The Labor and Defense System medal and certificate are uniformly issued by the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China. No locality may manufacture them on their own according to the design. Those in the Chinese People's Liberation Army system who participate in the Labor and Defense System test and meet the standards will be awarded medals and certificates by the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army entrusted by the Physical Culture and Sports Commission. The Level 1 Labor and Defense System medal and certificate are only issued to those who pass the Level 1 training test in units that have been approved by the sports commissions or county cultural and educational sections of municipalities directly under the central government and cities under the jurisdiction of provinces to implement the Labor and Defense System.

　　全国中等以上学校推行劳卫制有成绩
　　体育运动委员会通告颁发劳卫制证章、证书
    自去年五月四日中央人民政府体育运动委员会公布了“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称劳卫制）的暂行条例和暂行项目标准以后，到去年年底为止，全国除热河、青海、新疆、西康四省和内蒙古、西藏两地外，已有一百八十七所中等以上学校的十二万七千四百多名学生参加了劳卫制一级的锻炼；有二千三百六十多所中等以上学校的一百十五万九千多名学生参加了劳卫制预备级的锻炼。
    推行劳卫制以后，学生的健康状况有了很大的改进。参加劳卫制锻炼的学生普遍反映：体重增加，疾病减少，学习效率也有了提高。各地学校中已涌现出不少能做到“三好”的学生。
    推行劳卫制以后，学生的运动技术水平也提高得很快。郑州电力学校的四百多名学生参加了劳卫制锻炼，不到半年就有半数学生达到了劳卫制一级的锻炼标准。在各地举行的运动会上，推行了劳卫制的学校成绩都比较突出。
    劳卫制的推行也促进了学校中的体育教学改革。许多学校都以劳卫制为基础，编制了新的教材，改变了过去旧的单元制教学和单纯培养少数运动员的错误观点和方法，初步解决了体育课同劳卫制相结合的问题，丰富了体育课和课外活动的内容。
    中华人民共和国体育运动委员会，于五月四日发布关于颁发“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称劳卫制）证章、证书的通告。
    通告中说：为了表扬劳卫制测验合格者在体育锻炼上所表现的爱国主义精神，鼓励他们更好地为参加社会主义建设和保卫祖国而坚持锻炼，特根据劳卫制暂行条例第十九条颁发劳卫制一级证章、证书。通告并指出：获得劳卫制一级证章、证书，说明已经受到较全面的体育教育，为劳动与卫国准备了一定的身体条件。并应继续坚持锻炼，争取达到二级标准和提高运动技术水平。
    通告规定：劳卫制证章、证书由中华人民共和国体育运动委员会统一颁发。各地不得依照式样自行制发，中国人民解放军系统参加劳卫制测验达到标准者，由体育运动委员会委托中国人民解放军总政治部授予证章、证书。劳卫制一级证章、证书只发给经直辖市和省辖市的体育运动委员会或县文教科批准实行劳卫制的单位中，参加劳卫制一级锻炼测验及格者。（附图片）
