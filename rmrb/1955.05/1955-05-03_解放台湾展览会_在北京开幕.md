Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd -- The "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" opened in the Working People's Cultural Palace in the capital today.

　　The exhibition includes four parts, containing various pictures, objects, charts, models, and works of art. The exhibition uses vivid and powerful materials to show the audience that Taiwan has been an inseparable part of our country's territory since ancient times, exposes the crimes of American imperialism in occupying Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out dark rule over the Taiwanese people, and expresses the determination of our people to liberate Taiwan and the achievements made in strengthening work in all aspects for this just struggle.

　　Stepping into the gate of the exhibition, the audience is attracted by a huge sand table. The sand table marks the entire Pacific region situation map from the east coast of China to the west coast of the United States. The narrator turned on the button, and an indicative line from the United States to Taiwan, marking the distance, tells people that American imperialism shamelessly uses the pretext that the Taiwan Strait is related to the security of the United States, and forcibly occupies our Taiwan and coastal islands with force, while in fact Taiwan is more than 20,000 li away from the United States. People saw that behind this sand table was a huge slogan expressing the will of the 600 million people of China, which read: "The people of China must unite more strongly and strive to liberate Taiwan, oppose American interference, defend national security, and defend world peace!"

　　The first part of the exhibition is of particular interest. Many objects and pictures tell people that our ancestors used their hard work to build their homes on this treasure island, rich in resources and beautiful in scenery; and how many times they fought against foreign invaders to defend the territory and sovereignty of the motherland. The audience watched with admiration the pictures of Zheng Chenggong, a national hero of the Ming Dynasty, defeating the Dutch colonial army that invaded Taiwan. People also saw from the exhibited historical relics that the United States had the ambition to invade Taiwan of our country as early as more than a hundred years ago. In 1867, the United States sent two warships to attack Taiwan, but was defeated and fled by the Taiwanese compatriots. In 1874, the United States helped Japan to invade Taiwan again, sending warships to help transport Japanese troops, but was again repelled by Taiwanese compatriots. People know that even during the Second World War, important historical documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, signed by the U.S. government, affirmed that Taiwan was our country's territory and that the Japanese invaders should unconditionally return Taiwan to our country. Now, these historical documents are on display at the exhibition.

　　The second part of the exhibition reveals in detail the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade our country's territory of Taiwan. A photo that was published in "U.S. News & World Report" in February of this year is particularly attractive to the audience. In the photo, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stands in front of a map of the People's Republic of China, pointing to our country's territory of Taiwan, plotting a despicable conspiracy of aggression. Many pictures show that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the help and instigation of the United States, constantly carried out sabotage and harassment on the coastal areas of our mainland, and brutally killed the people of Taiwan. Eighteen photos introducing the cruel atrocities inflicted on the people by the Chiang bandits' concentration camps aroused great indignation among the audience.

　　The third and fourth parts of the exhibition show the determination and strength of our government and people to resolutely liberate Taiwan, as well as the great efforts made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan. People can see in the exhibition that workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life across the country have actively launched labor production competitions to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, especially the people in Zhejiang and Fujian coastal areas, who have shouldered the arduous task of supporting the People's Liberation Army in liberating the coastal islands. In the large-scale oil paintings and photos exhibited, such as "Pishan Naval Battle," "Toumen Mountain Naval Battle," "Gunboat Attack," "Dongshan Island Battle," "Sinking the Chiang Bandit Army's Taiping Ship," and "Liberating Yijiangshan Island," it is shown that the People's Liberation Army has become stronger and stronger through past battles, and has a powerful force that is invincible. A chart on display at the exhibition shows that from October 1, 1949 to February 28, 1955, the People's Liberation Army killed or wounded more than 50,000 enemies in the battles in the southeastern coastal areas, captured 220,000 enemies, and 70,000 enemies surrendered to us. 2,984 cannons of various types were seized, more than 206,000 guns of various types were seized, 56 enemy ships, boats, and vessels were sunk, destroyed, or damaged, 307 enemy ships, boats, and vessels were captured, 198 enemy planes were shot down or damaged, and 7 enemy planes surrendered and revolted. Inside and outside the exhibition hall, people saw the wreckage of the destroyed enemy planes and many American-made weapons seized in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island. When the audience finally left the exhibition, they saw a passage from Vice Chairman Zhu De: "If we do not completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and liberate Taiwan, our task of liberating the whole of China will not be completed. If Taiwan is not liberated for a day, the people of the whole country, especially the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, will not have washed away the shame on their bodies for a day, and we will have nothing to be proud of."

　　The last large oil painting in the exhibition hall, "What are you doing to liberate Taiwan?" attracted almost all the audience. When they walked out of the exhibition hall, they wrote down their thoughts in the opinion book, expressing that they must contribute their greatest strength to liberate Taiwan.

　　“解放台湾展览会”在北京开幕
    新华社二日讯　在首都举办的“解放台湾展览会”二日在劳动人民文化宫开幕。
    展览会包括四个部分，其中有各种图片、实物、图表、模型和美术作品。展览会以生动有力的材料向观众们表明了台湾自古以来就是我国领土不可分割的一部分，揭露了美帝国主义侵占台湾和蒋介石卖国集团对台湾人民进行黑暗统治的罪行，并且表达了我国人民一定要解放台湾的决心以及为这一正义斗争而从各方面加强工作的成就。
    踏进展览会的大门，观众们被一个巨大的沙盘所吸引。沙盘标示了从中国东海岸到美国西海岸的太平洋区域形势全图。解说员开动了电钮，一条从美国到台湾的标明距离的示意线告诉人们，美帝国主义无耻地借口台湾海峡关系到美国的安全，而用武力霸占了我国的台湾和沿海岛屿，其实台湾距离美国有两万多华里。人们看到，在这个沙盘后面的布幕上写着一幅表达全中国六亿人民意志的巨大标语，标语写道：“全中国人民更加坚强地团结起来，为解放台湾、反对美国干涉、保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平而奋斗！”
    展览会的第一部分特别引起人们的兴趣。许多实物和图片告诉人们，我们的祖先用自己辛勤的劳动在这个物产丰富、风景优美的宝岛建立了自己的家园；他们又经过了多少次反抗外国侵略者的斗争保卫了祖国的领土和主权。观众们怀着景仰的心情观看了明朝民族英雄郑成功击败侵略台湾的荷兰殖民军的图片。人们也从展出的历史文物中看到了美国远在一百多年前就有了侵略我国台湾的野心。一八六七年美国曾派了两艘军舰来攻打台湾，结果被台湾同胞打得大败而逃。一八七四年，美国又帮助日本来侵略台湾，派军舰帮助运送日本军队，结果又被台湾同胞打退。人们知道，还在第二次世界大战期间，在有美国政府签字的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告等重要的历史文件上就肯定了台湾是我国的领土，日本侵略者应该无条件地将台湾归还我国。现在，这些历史文件都陈列在展览会上。
    展览会的第二部分详尽地揭露了美帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾的阴谋。曾经在今年二月登载在“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志上的一张照片，特别吸引了观众。在照片上，美国国务卿杜勒斯站在一张中华人民共和国地图的前面，用手指着我国领土台湾，正在策划卑鄙的侵略阴谋。许多图片表明了蒋介石卖国集团在美国的帮助和指使下，不断向我国大陆沿海进行破坏和骚扰，并残暴地杀害台湾人民。十八幅介绍蒋贼集中营对人民施行惨酷暴行的照片，引起了观众极大的愤恨。
    展览会的第三部分和第四部分，表现了我国政府和人民坚决解放台湾的决心和力量，以及中国人民解放军和全国人民为解放台湾而进行的巨大努力。人们在展览会上看出，全国的工人、农民和各界人民为支援解放台湾的斗争，积极展开了劳动生产竞赛，特别是浙江、福建沿海等地人民，担负起了支援人民解放军解放沿海岛屿的繁重的战勤工作。在展出的“披山海战”、“头门山海战”、“炮舰攻击”、“东山岛战斗”、“击沉蒋贼军太平号军舰”、“解放一江山岛”等巨幅油画和照片中，显示了人民解放军经过历次战斗，已经愈战愈强，具有了战无不胜的强大力量。展览会上陈列的一张图表说明：从一九四九年十月一日到一九五五年二月二十八日，人民解放军在东南沿海的战斗中，毙伤敌人有五万多名，俘敌二十二万多名，敌人向我投诚的有七万多名，缴获各种炮二千九百八十四门，缴获各种枪二十万六千多支，击沉、击毁、击伤敌舰、艇、船只五十六艘，俘敌舰、艇、船只三百零七艘，击落击伤敌飞机一百九十八架，敌机投诚起义的有七架。在展览室内外，人们看到了被击毁的敌机残骸和许多在解放一江山岛战斗中缴获的美制武器。当观众们最后离开展览会以前，他们看到朱德副主席的一段语录：“不彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮，不把台湾解放，我们解放全中国的任务就还没有完成。台湾一天不解放，我们全国人民，首先是人民解放军指战员，就一天没有洗清自己身上的耻辱，我们更没有什么值得骄傲的地方。”
    展览室最后的一幅“你为解放台湾做些什么？”的大油画几乎吸引了所有的观众。他们在走出展览室的时候，纷纷在意见簿上写下了自己的感想，表示一定要为解放台湾而贡献自己最大的力量。
