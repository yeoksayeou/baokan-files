　　Changchun, May 17th (by our reporter) – The No. 1 steam turbine generator of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's thermal power station began trial operation at 1:35 AM on the 17th and will soon be officially connected to the grid. Currently, approximately 85% of the machinery and equipment of this thermal power station has been installed. The workers responsible for the equipment installation, following the suggestions of Soviet experts, are adopting a pre-assembly method to install the remaining machinery and equipment, striving to complete the installation of the No. 2 steam turbine generator as soon as possible.
　　The thermal power station is one of the ten major factory buildings of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Construction began at the end of 1953, and machinery installation began in June 1954. This thermal power station has three major workshops: boiler, electrical, and water treatment, and its main task is to supply the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant with the required electricity, steam, and heating for workers' dormitories. This thermal power station is equipped with the latest modern and automated equipment, which places relatively high demands on the workers' cultural and technical levels. The workers who are now operating the machinery have been selected from excellent power plants throughout the Northeast region, and generally have more than five years of work experience.
　　Changchun, May 17th (by our reporter) – The central avenue of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has now officially started construction. This marks the basic completion of the buildings on both sides of the avenue, and the majority of the civil engineering construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been completed.
　　The central avenue project includes fifteen engineering items, some at high altitudes, some underground, involving ten construction zones, and requiring close cooperation from mechanical supply, electromechanical installation, and power departments. The workers, who have accumulated two years of construction experience at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site, are not afraid of these difficulties and have decided to complete this project by July 15th – the second anniversary of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's groundbreaking ceremony.

　　第一汽车厂一号汽轮发电机开始试运转
    本报长春十七日电　第一汽车制造厂热电站的一号汽轮发电机已经在十七日一时三十五分开始试运转，不久就可以正式送电。现在，这座热电站的机器设备已经安装百分之八十五左右。负责安装设备的职工们，正在按照苏联专家的建议，采用预组合的方式，安装尚未完成的机器设备，争取早日完成第二号汽轮发电机的安装工作。
    热电站是第一汽车制造厂的十大厂房之一，在一九五三年底动工兴建，一九五四年六月进行机器安装工作。这座热电站有锅炉、电气透平等三大车间，主要任务是供给第一汽车制造厂需用的电力、蒸气及职工宿舍的暖气。这座热电站安装有最近代化、自动化的设备，对工人的文化、技术水平要求比较高。现在已经到机器旁边操作的工人，都是东北各地发电厂选拔来的优秀工人，一般都有五年以上的工龄。
    本报长春十七日电　第一汽车制造厂的中央大道，现在已经正式动工兴建。这标志着大道两旁的建筑物已经基本竣工，第一汽车制造厂的土木建筑工程已经大部完成。
    中央大道工程包括十五个工程项目，有的在高空，有的在地下，左右牵连到十个工区，又需要机械供应、机电安装和动力等部门的密切配合。在第一汽车制造厂工地上已经积累了两年建筑经验的职工们不怕这些困难，决定在七月十五日——第一汽车制造厂奠基二周年纪念日完成这项工程。
