　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 18th: Newspaper reports state that the situation in French North Africa remains tense.

　　According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), in the past three days alone, there have been four major and fierce armed conflicts between local residents and French troops in many provinces of Algeria, and the French Air Force has also been deployed.

　　French authorities are responding to the rising national liberation movement in North Africa by further intensifying repression. The French government held a special meeting on the 16th to discuss the situation in Algeria. Minister of the Interior, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, reported on measures taken to deal with the national liberation movement based on the recently passed "state of emergency law." The meeting passed a resolution to have retired military officers who previously served in North Africa return there to continue their service. Prior to this, the French government decided to transfer two thousand gendarmes to Algeria to reinforce the police force there.

　　The suppression of the Tunisian people has also intensified. According to Agence France-Presse, on May 14th, French authorities in Tunisia seized the Arabic-language "Al-Sha'ab" (organ of the Tunisian General Labour Union) and "Action," because they published photos of recent events in which a Tunisian farmworker striker was killed and four others were injured.

    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：报纸消息，法属北非的局势仍旧紧张。
    据法新社报道，仅仅在最近三天内阿尔及利亚许多省的当地居民同法国军队发生了四次很大的激烈的武装冲突，法国空军也出动了。
    法国当局用进一步加紧镇压来对付北非高涨的民族解放运动。法国政府十六日举行了特别会议，讨论阿尔及利亚的局势。内政部长布歇—莫努里作了关于根据不久前通过的“紧急状态法”而采取的对付民族解放运动的措施的报告。会议通过一项决定，要曾经在北非服役的退职军官再到北非继续供职。在这之前，法国政府决定调动两千名宪兵到阿尔及利亚，加强那里的警察队伍。
    对突尼斯人民的镇压也加紧了。据法新社报道，五月十四日突尼斯法国当局查封了用阿拉伯文出版的“民声报”（突尼斯工人联合会机关报）和
  “行动报”，因为它们登载了不久前发生的事件的照片，在这些事件中突尼斯的一个雇农罢工者牺牲了，其他四人受伤。
