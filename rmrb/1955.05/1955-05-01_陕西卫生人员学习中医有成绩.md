Shaanxi Health Personnel Achieve Results in Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine

　　Since January of this year, health workers in various parts of Shaanxi Province have universally launched the study of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and this study has now achieved certain results.

　　Through this study, health departments and health workers at all levels in the province have overcome the erroneous idea of ​​underestimating TCM. Before the study, many health workers mistakenly believed that TCM was "feudal and had nothing to learn," and some mistakenly believed that "studying Chinese herbal medicine is okay, but studying TCM is meaningless." After studying, they analyzed the reasons for these ideas and criticized them, clarifying that carrying forward the legacy of Chinese medicine and developing modern medicine are unified. Now, most of the people's hospitals and health centers in the province have formulated plans for carrying out TCM work this year and have begun to sort out and use Chinese herbal medicines. Li Baozhong, a physician at Yan'an People's Hospital, used to be unwilling to ask TCM doctors for consultation. Now he says, "Asking TCM doctors for consultation is a good opportunity for mutual learning."

　　At the same time, this study has also laid the foundation for academic exchanges between TCM and Western medicine. Zhong Deming, a medical assistant at Yan'an People's Hospital, used the TCM method of using Coptis chinensis to treat otitis media, and worked with the pharmacy to study the application of preparations, achieving good medical results. After studying, many people felt that some of the diagnostic and treatment theories and methods of TCM were in line with the Soviet Pavlovian theory. From these specific activities, the interest of Western medicine practitioners in learning TCM has been enhanced, and at the same time, they have actively introduced modern medical theories to TCM doctors.

　　In order to further carry out the study of TCM, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Health instructed health departments at all levels to combine the study of TCM with criticizing Wang Bin's bourgeois ideology of underestimating TCM, and actively strengthen the education of materialism for health personnel.

　　陕西卫生人员学习中医有成绩
    陕西省各地的卫生工作人员，从今年一月起普遍展开了对中医学的学习，现在这一学习已经取得了一定的成绩。
    经过这次学习，全省各级卫生部门和卫生工作人员克服了轻视中医的错误思想。学习以前，很多卫生工作人员错误地认为中医是“封建的，没什么可学”，也有人错误地认为“学中药还可以，学中医没意思”。经过学习，他们分析了这些思想产生的原因，并作了批判，明确了发扬祖国医学遗产和发展现代医学是统一的。现在全省各人民医院和卫生院大部都制定了今年开展中医工作的计划，并开始对中药进行整理和使用。延安人民医院医师李葆忠，以前不愿请中医会诊，现在他说：“请中医会诊，是互相学习的好机会。”
    同时，经过这次学习，也给中西医的学术交流打下了基础。延安人民医院医士钟德明根据中医用黄连治中耳炎的方法，同药房研究配剂的应用，取得了良好的医疗效果。许多人经过学习以后，觉得中医有些诊疗理论和方法，符合于苏联的巴甫洛夫学说。从这些具体的活动中，提高了西医学习中医的兴趣，同时他们主动地把现代医学理论向中医介绍。
    为了进一步开展对中医的学习，陕西省卫生厅指示各级卫生部门把对中医的学习和批判王斌轻视中医的资产阶级思想结合起来，积极对卫生人员加强唯物主义的教育。　（江）
