　　A Major Step to Guarantee European Peace and Security
　　By our correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    The Warsaw Conference of European countries for guaranteeing European peace and security concluded victoriously on May 14th after signing the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. Thus, on the scales where war and peace are in fierce struggle in Europe and even the world, a weighty measure has been added to the side of peace.
    At 10:00 AM, the signing ceremony of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance was held in the building of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic. On a large table at the end of the building, four texts of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in Russian, German, Polish, and Czech were placed. Delegations from various countries arrived one after another. The Soviet delegation, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, the delegation of the Polish People's Republic, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, and Comrade Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China, Peng Dehuai, who attended the meeting as an observer, entered the building simultaneously. The signing ceremony then began. The chief representatives of the delegations signed the treaty texts in the four languages ​​in the order of the first letter of the Russian name of each country.
    In the middle of the signing ceremony, the chief representatives of the delegations and the Chinese observer stood side by side behind the signing seats, holding pleasant short conversations, symbolizing the strong unity and strength of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp from Asia to Europe.
    After the signing was completed, Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic spoke, pointing out that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance was a great support for the German people, and stated that the goal of the German people remains to achieve the unity of the country on a peaceful basis. He also declared that a unified Germany would not be bound by the obligations stipulated in any military or political treaty or agreement concluded by either part of Germany before unification.
    Deputy Prime Minister Peng Dehuai, the observer of the People's Republic of China, then spoke, congratulating the achievements of the Warsaw Conference and announcing that the Government of the People's Republic of China would give full cooperation and support to the decisions made by the conference.
    Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, spoke last. He pointed out the important significance of the Warsaw Conference to the cause of world peace, and believed that the support expressed by the representative of the People's Republic of China for the measures adopted by the conference was of particular importance. The signing ceremony concluded at this point. The delegations warmly shook hands with each other, congratulating the success of the conference.
    The signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance by the Warsaw Conference is an action of great historical significance. According to the treaty, the contracting countries will establish a joint command to support each other in the event of armed attack. The contracting states will also establish a Political Consultative Committee to consult on all matters of common interest to them. The treaty states that it is open to all countries that are willing to work together to defend the peace and security of their peoples, and that the contracting states will unswervingly strive to establish a pan-European collective security system. The treaty also stipulates that once a pan-European collective security treaty is concluded and enters into force, this treaty will lose its effect.
    It can be seen that this treaty is not only a powerful weapon against aggression in Europe, but also an effective tool for promoting the settlement of outstanding international issues through peaceful consultation. It will greatly promote the struggle of the European people against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, thereby making an immeasurable contribution to guaranteeing European peace and security.
    Since the ratification of the Paris Agreements, a sharp struggle has taken place in Europe between the forces of peace and the forces of war. The US aggressive bloc would like to establish a million-strong West German militarist force overnight, confronting the European people with the accomplished fact of the revival of German militarism, in order to drive them into another war and permanently divide Germany. The US aggressive bloc knows very well that a divided Germany is the basis for the revival of West German militarism and will become Europe's powder keg that the US can detonate at any time.
    But in Europe, people are increasingly uneasy about the consequences of ratifying the Paris Agreements. The people of Western Europe have not been deceived by Washington's propaganda about the inevitability of war; they demand negotiations between East and West to find a way out of the current tense situation. The "Washington Post" admits that "the greatest force in the whole of Western Europe is the willingness for peace and the avoidance of atomic war… This force cannot be ignored; it represents the hopes and fears of many Europeans." Because of this desire to avoid war, many European countries, proceeding from their national interests, have shown a tendency towards neutralism, unwilling to associate themselves with the imperialist aggressive bloc.
    In West Germany, which has become the focus of the European situation, this tendency is also growing, as the British magazine "The Economist" admits, the Germans are "openly declaring their patriotic desire to end the division, and the more they suspect Western countries of obstructing it, the more definite this demand becomes." The West German people are paying close attention to the resolution of the Austrian issue. From the position taken by the Soviet Union in resolving the Austrian peace treaty, they clearly see the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions and also see that the way to peacefully unify Germany lies in preventing the implementation of the Paris Agreements and not associating with the aggressive bloc organized by the United States. The United States has become very uneasy and panicked about this tendency and sentiment expressed by the West German people. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance concluded at the Warsaw Conference pointed out to the people of Europe and West Germany the serious consequences of implementing the Paris Agreements, and also pointed out that it is still possible to prevent the implementation of the Paris Agreements in order to guarantee European peace and security. This treaty, as well as the new proposals on disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union, point out that the way out of the European situation lies in preventing the implementation of the Paris Agreements and establishing a pan-European collective security system. They will become a powerful weapon for the European people to fight against the forces of war, and will promote the development of the European situation. Immediately after the Warsaw Conference, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will meet in Vienna to sign the Austrian peace treaty. The resolution of the Austrian issue will undoubtedly strengthen the struggle of the German people for the peaceful reunification of their country, and the treaty concluded at the Warsaw Conference will play a powerful levering role in this regard. The people of Warsaw held a grand mass rally on the afternoon of the 14th to celebrate the signing of the eight-nation Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. There is no doubt that peace-loving people all over the world will celebrate this major step taken by the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp to ease international tensions with the same joy as the Polish people. Warsaw, May 14th.

　　保障欧洲和平和安全的重大步骤
　　本报记者  蒋元椿
    五月十四日，保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家华沙会议在缔结了友好合作互助条约之后胜利闭幕。这样，在欧洲以至全世界的战争与和平进行着尖锐斗争的天平上，在和平力量这方面又增加了一个有分量的法码。
    上午十时，在波兰人民共和国国务委员会大厦举行了友好合作互助条约的签字仪式。在大厦尽头的一张大桌上，安放着友好合作互助条约的俄文、德文、波兰文和捷克斯洛伐克文的四种文本。各国代表团络续到来。以苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁为首的苏联代表团，以波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰人民共和国代表团和波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特同志，以观察员身份参加会议的中华人民共和国代表彭德怀副总理同时进入大厦。签字仪式随即开始。各国代表团的首席代表按照各国俄文名称第一个字母的次序在四种文字的条约文本上签字。
    在签字仪式进行中间，各国代表团的首席代表和中国观察员并肩地站在签字席位后面，进行着愉快的短促的交谈，象征着从亚洲到欧洲和平民主社会主义阵营的坚强的团结和力量。
    签字完毕以后，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥发言，他指出友好合作互助条约对德国人民是一个很大的支持，并且表示德国人民的目标仍然是在和平的基础上求得国家的统一。他并且声明，统一后的德国，将不受德国两部分的任何一部分在统一以前缔结的任何军事或政治条约或协定所规定的义务的约束。
    中华人民共和国观察员彭德怀副总理接着发言，他祝贺华沙会议所取得的成就，并且宣布中华人民共和国政府对于会议所作出的决定给予完全的合作和支持。
    波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹最后发言。他指出了华沙会议对世界和平事业的重要意义，并且认为中华人民共和国代表所表示的中国政府和人民对会议所采取的措施的支持具有特别重要的意义。签字仪式至此结束。各国代表热烈地互相握手，庆贺会议的成功。
    华沙会议签订友好合作互助条约，是一个有重大历史意义的行动。根据条约，缔约各国将建立联合司令部以便在一旦遭到武装进攻时互相支援。各缔约国并将建立政治协商委员会以便就一切和它们共同利益有关的事情进行磋商。条约表示它对于凡是愿意一起来为保卫各国人民的和平和安全而努力的国家都是敞开着门的，而且缔约国将坚持不渝地为建立全欧集体安全体系而努力。条约并且规定一旦全欧集体安全条约缔结并且生效，本条约即将丧失其效力。
    可以看出，这个条约不仅是在欧洲反对侵略的有力武器，同时也是促使以和平协商的方式解决悬而未决的国际问题的有效工具。它将大大推动欧洲人民反对实施巴黎协定的斗争，从而对保障欧洲和平和安全作出无可估量的贡献。
    从巴黎协定批准以来，和平力量和战争势力在欧洲进行了尖锐的斗争。美国侵略集团恨不得在一夜之间将一百万人的西德军国主义的部队建立起来，使欧洲人民面对德国军国主义复活的既成事实，以便把他们驱入另一次战争，并且使德国永远分裂。美国侵略集团知道得很清楚，一个分裂的德国是复活西德军国主义的基础并且将成为美国可以随时使它爆炸的欧洲的火药库。
    但是在欧洲，人们对批准巴黎协定的后果越来越感到不安。西欧人民并没有被华盛顿的战争不可避免的宣传论调所蒙骗，他们要求举行东西方之间的谈判以求从当前的紧张局势中找到出路。“华盛顿邮报”承认，“整个西欧最大的势力就是愿意和平和避免原子战争……这种势力是不能忽视的，它代表着许多欧洲人的希望和恐惧”。由于这种要求避免战争的愿望，不少欧洲国家从它们的民族利益出发，表现了不愿和帝国主义侵略集团发生联系的中立主义倾向。
    在成为欧洲局势的焦点的西德，这种倾向也正在增长，正如英国的“经济学家”杂志所承认的，德国人“公开地宣布他们要求结束分裂的爱国的愿望，他们越是怀疑西方国家在进行阻挠，这种要求也就变得越是肯定”。西德人民密切注意着奥地利问题的解决，他们从苏联在解决对奥和约问题上所采取的立场清楚地看到苏联的和平意愿并且也看到了和平统一德国的途径在于阻止巴黎协定的实施，不和美国所组织的侵略集团发生联系。美国对于西德人民所表示的这种倾向和情绪已经感到十分不安和恐慌。华沙会议所缔结的友好合作互助条约向欧洲和西德人民指出了实施巴黎协定的严重后果，同时也指出了还来得及阻止巴黎协定的实施以保障欧洲和平和安全。这个条约以及苏联提出的关于裁军的新建议，都指出了欧洲局势的出路在于阻止巴黎协定的实施，和建立全欧集体安全体系。它们将成为欧洲人民对战争势力进行斗争的有力的武器，推动欧洲局势的发展。紧接着华沙会议之后，苏、美、英、法四国外长将在维也纳集会，签订对奥和约。奥地利问题的解决，无疑将使德国人民加强为和平统一他们的国家而进行的斗争，而华沙会议所缔结的条约，将在这方面起有力的杠杆作用。华沙人民在十四日下午举行了盛大的群众集会来庆祝八国友好合作互助条约的签订。毫无疑问，全世界爱好和平的人民都将怀着和波兰人民同样快慰的心情来欢庆和平民主社会主义阵营这一为缓和国际紧张局势而采取的重大步骤。  五月十四日发自华沙
