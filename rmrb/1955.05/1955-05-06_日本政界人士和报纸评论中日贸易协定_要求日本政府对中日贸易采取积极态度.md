Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 5th – Japanese political figures have published articles and given talks commenting on the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Labor-Farmer Party Diet member Kihachiro Kimura published an article entitled "The Achievements of the Third Japan-China Trade Agreement," stating that the signing of this trade agreement has historical significance. This is because the previous two agreements were signed in Beijing, while this time the trade delegation from the People's Republic of China was invited to Tokyo to negotiate trade and sign the agreement. Additionally, Prime Minister Hatoyama expressed his willingness to assist in the realization of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Kimura pointed out that the fundamental reason why the previous two Japan-China trade agreements were not fully realized was that the Japanese government adopted a passive attitude towards Sino-Japanese trade and did not assume its due responsibilities. The Yoshida Cabinet implemented a trade policy that followed a certain country, did not attach importance to Japan-China trade, and attempted to develop in Southeast Asia, which resulted in Japan's exports being constantly unstable.

Hiroo Wada, Secretary-General of the Leftist Socialist Party, said in a statement that it was a happy event that the Japan-China trade agreement was signed in Tokyo. The agreement was reached due to concessions from the Chinese side. He pointed out that the Japanese government must fulfill its promises regarding the removal of trade restrictions, the establishment of permanent business representative offices, and the conclusion of payment agreements in the future, and we will work hard in the Diet to urge its realization.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Rightist Socialist Party, pointed out the obstruction activities of the United States during the agreement negotiations and expressed that he would request the Japanese government to show sincerity in promoting Japan-China trade.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 5th – On the evening of the 4th, major Tokyo newspapers published the news of the signing of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, the full text of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, the joint communiqué issued by the Chinese visiting Japanese trade delegation and the two Japanese negotiating groups, and the exchange of letters between Shozo Murata, Masanosuke Ikeda, and delegation leader Lei Renmin on the front pages in prominent positions.

The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on the 5th, urging the Japanese government to adopt a positive and firm attitude towards Sino-Japanese trade.

The editorial said: From the course of this Sino-Japanese trade negotiation, it can be seen how much sincerity the Japanese government has in trading with China. The Hatoyama Cabinet promised to promote trade with China, which everyone knows, but as the days went by, its attitude became ambiguous. Prime Minister Hatoyama sometimes said that he was not concerned about Sino-Japanese trade negotiations, and sometimes he said that he would provide assistance to the negotiations. It is really necessary to clarify the relationship between these two different policies.

The editorial talked about the issue of lifting the embargo, saying that China needs construction equipment. If the restrictions on the embargo cannot be eased and the export of construction equipment increased, then iron ore, coal, salt, etc., which Japan urgently needs, will not be available. Therefore, it is hoped that the Japanese government will fully explain Japan's position, demand the lifting of the embargo restrictions, and not just talk empty words or slack off in actual actions.

The editorial believes that one of the most important issues in this agreement is the issue of establishing mutual business representative offices. The editorial said: If it can be substantially achieved to send business representative offices enjoying diplomatic privileges to each other, then not only can trade barriers be removed, but also practical matters related to trade can be handled. If this issue can be realized, we believe that it is an important step forward towards establishing normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. The editorial called on the Japanese government to express a clear attitude on this issue.

The editorial also said: Japan's export trade volume to China increased fourfold in 1954 compared to 1953, which seems to be a considerable recovery. However, if compared with Japan's trade with other countries, it is only equivalent to a quarter of Japan's export volume to Brazil, which shows how the economic relations between Japan and its neighboring country are obstructed by "political reasons."

The editorial concluded: There are still many issues to be resolved in the new agreement. But without a doubt, this signed agreement will have an effect on the rapprochement between China and Japan and the normalization of trade.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial on the 5th expressed regret that the Japanese government had not taken concrete measures for this Sino-Japanese trade agreement. The editorial said that it hopes the Japanese government will handle practical matters related to expanding Sino-Japanese trade, which is better than just paying lip service to the restoration of diplomatic relations.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" editorial on the 5th said: This Japan-China trade agreement is helpful in increasing trade between the two countries in the future. This agreement will be able to remove the state of groping between the two countries' trade in the past. The editorial also said: It is not impossible for the Japanese government to implement this trade agreement smoothly with a positive attitude. The Hatoyama Cabinet, which has promoting Sino-Japanese trade as its slogan, will inevitably be accused of failing to fulfill its promises if it does not make every effort for this Japan-China trade agreement.

### 日本政界人士和报纸评论中日贸易协定  要求日本政府对中日贸易采取积极态度

　　日本政界人士和报纸评论中日贸易协定
　  要求日本政府对中日贸易采取积极态度
    新华社东京五日电　日本政界人士发表文章和谈话评论第三次中日贸易协定。
    劳农党议员木村禧八郎以“第三次日中贸易协定的成果”为题发表文章说：这次贸易协定的签订有着历史意义。因为，过去两次协议都是在北京签订，而这次是邀请了中华人民共和国的贸易代表团到东京来谈判贸易和签订协定，同时鸠山首相也表示愿意协助第三次中日贸易协定实现。木村指出：过去两次日中贸易协定未能充分实现的根本原因在于日本政府对中日贸易采取了消极的态度，没有承担应负的责任。过去吉田内阁执行了追随某国的不重视日中贸易、企图向东南亚发展的贸易政策，结果使日本的输出经常处于不安定的状态。
    左派社会党总书记和田博雄发表谈话说：在东京签订了日中贸易协定是一件令人高兴的事。协议是由于中国方面的让步而达成的。他指出：日本政府今后必须履行关于解除贸易限制、互设常驻商务代表机构和缔结支付协定等诺言，我们将在国会上努力督促其实现。
    右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎指出在协定谈判过程中美国的阻挠活动，并表示将要求日本政府对促进日中贸易表现出诚意来。
    新华社东京五日电　四日晚间的东京各大报纸在第一版的显著地位刊载了中日贸易协定签字的消息和中日贸易协定全文、中国访问日本贸易代表团和日本两谈判团体联合发表的公报，以及村田省藏、池田正之辅和雷任民团长交换信件的消息。
      “朝日新闻”五日发表社论，要求日本政府对中日贸易采取积极的坚定的态度。
    社论说：从这次中日贸易谈判的经过情形，可以看出日本政府对同中国进行贸易究竟有多少诚意。鸠山内阁许下了促进对中国的贸易的诺言，这是任何人都知道的，可是随着日子的一天一天过去，它的态度也就暧昧起来了，鸠山首相有时说他对中日贸易谈判并不关心，有时又说对谈判给予协助，究竟这两种不同的方针是怎样的一个关系，实在有明确的必要。
    社论谈到解除禁运问题说，中国需要建设器材。如果不能缓和禁运的限制、增加建设器材的输出，那末，日本非常需要的铁矿砂、煤、盐等也不可能买到。因此希望日本政府充分说明日本的立场，要求解除禁运的束缚，不要说空话、不要对实际行动怠工。
    社论认为这次协定最值得重视的一个问题是互设商务代表机构的问题。社论说：如果实质上能做到互相派遣享有外交官待遇的商务代表机构，那末，不但可以扫除贸易上的障碍，还可以处理有关贸易的实际事务。这一问题如果能够实现，我们相信是向建立两国间的正常的外交关系前进了重要的一步。社论要求日本政府对这个问题表示明确的态度。
    社论还说：日本向中国输出的贸易额一九五四年比一九五三年增加了四倍，看起来有了相当的恢复。但是，如果和日本同其他国家的贸易比较起来仅仅相当于日本向巴西输出额的四分之一，这就表明了日本和它的邻国的经济关系是怎样地被“政治上的理由”所阻碍了。
    社论最后说：新的协定中留待解决的问题是不少的。但是毫无疑问，这次签定的协定将对中日两国的接近和贸易的正常化发生效果。
    “读卖新闻”五日的社论对日本政府没有对这次中日贸易协定采取具体措施表示遗憾。社论说，希望日本政府处理有关扩大中日贸易的实际事务，这比空口说恢复国交还要好一些。
      “每日新闻”五日的社论说：这次的日中贸易协定对增进今后两国的贸易是有作用的。这次的协定将可解除过去两国贸易之间的摸索状态。社论还说：日本政府以积极的态度使这次贸易协定顺利实施并不是不可能的。以促进中日贸易为口号的鸠山内阁，如果对这次日中贸易协定不作尽可能的努力，那末，它将不免要受到不履行诺言的指责。
