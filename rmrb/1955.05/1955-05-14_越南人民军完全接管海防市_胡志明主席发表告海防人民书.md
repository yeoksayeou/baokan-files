　　Vietnamese People's Army Completely Takes Over Haiphong City
　　Ho Chi Minh Issues Letter to the People of Haiphong
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: Today, the Vietnamese People's Army, amidst the cheers of the Vietnamese people, took over Haiphong City, the largest port in North Vietnam.
　　At 5:00 AM, the Vietnamese People's Army advanced simultaneously from the west in three routes, while the French Union forces gradually retreated. Before noon, the People's Army had already taken over the entire central area of Haiphong City, as well as public utilities such as the railway station, power plant, and waterworks. At 4:00 PM, the People's Army completely took over the dock area, announcing the liberation of the entire city of Haiphong.
　　The people of Haiphong celebrated wildly the liberation of their city. Wherever the People's Army and local administrative cadres took over, the golden-starred red flag was raised, and men, women, old and young rushed out of their houses, shouting "Long live Chairman Ho." Workers and street residents joyfully erected celebratory arches at intersections to celebrate the liberation, hanging portraits of Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The trucks carrying the takeover troops were filled with flowers presented by women and children.
　　As soon as the French troops at the gate of the waterworks turned to retreat, the workers immediately erected the golden-starred red flag and a huge banner spanning the road that they had secretly prepared half a month ago. The banner read: "Welcome the heroic People's Army who valiantly fought to liberate the motherland."
　　Haiphong—a city that had become extremely desolate due to the French Union forces' kidnapping of people—is now filled with the joy of liberation.
　　During the takeover of Haiphong, the Indian Chairman of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission, Desai, and representatives from Poland and Canada were present to inspect the scene.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a letter to the people of Haiphong on the 13th.
　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: "Thanks to the unity of our military and civilians and the heroic patriotic war we waged, the hostilities have ended, and peace has been won. France has recognized the independence and unity of our country. The areas previously occupied by France have been liberated one after another. Therefore, after eight years of struggle, our compatriots in Haiphong have regained their freedom. This is a major victory." Chairman Ho Chi Minh then congratulated the residents of Haiphong on behalf of the government.
　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on: "Workers should protect the seaport, factories, and warehouses, increase production, protect livestock and farm implements, and increase production to prevent and resist disasters; merchants and entrepreneurs should actively manage their businesses in order to accelerate economic recovery; cultural and educational workers should work hard to continuously educate the younger generation and enthusiastically serve the people."
　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "We have achieved many victories. But in order to consolidate peace, complete unification, and achieve independence and democracy, we still have a long and arduous struggle ahead of us. Therefore, we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, strengthen our fighting spirit, and strive to complete our tasks. We should not be complacent or arrogant."

　　越南人民军完全接管海防市
　　胡志明主席发表告海防人民书
    新华社河内十三日电　今天，越南人民军在越南人民的欢呼声中接管了北越最大的港口——海防市。
    上午五时，越南人民军分三路同时由西向东前进，法兰西联邦部队逐步向后撤离。中午以前，人民军就已经接管了海防市的全部中心区和火车站、发电厂、自来水厂等公用事业机构。下午四时，人民军完全接管了码头区，宣告了海防全城的解放。
    海防人民狂欢地迎接自己城市的解放。接管的人民军和地方行政干部一到那里，那里就升起金星红旗，男女老少从房子里冲出来高声欢呼“胡主席万岁”。工人和街道居民欢乐地在路口搭起庆祝解放的彩楼，挂上胡志明主席的画像。接管部队乘坐的卡车上插满妇女和儿童献的鲜花。
    自来水厂门口的法军刚刚向后转，工人们立刻竖起半个月前就秘密准备好的金星红旗和横贯马路的巨幅标语。标语上写着：“欢迎英勇的人民军英勇战斗解放祖国”。
    海防——这个由于法兰西联邦部队方面劫运人民而变得十分凄凉的城市，现在已经充满着解放的欢乐。
    在接管海防时，越南国际监督和监察委员会的印度主席德赛和波兰、加拿大代表都曾到场视察。
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国主席胡志明在十三日发表了告海防人民书。
    胡志明主席说：由于我们军民的团结一致和所进行的英勇的爱国战争，敌对行动结束了，和平获得了胜利。法国已经承认我们国家的独立和统一。以前法国占领的地区已相继解放。因此，经过八年斗争之后，我们的海防同胞再度恢复了他们的自由。这是一个重大的胜利。胡志明主席接着代表政府向海防居民祝贺。
    胡志明主席号召：工人们保护海港、工厂和仓库，提高生产量，保护牲畜和农具，增加生产以防止和抵抗灾荒；商人和企业家积极经营企业，以便加速经济的恢复；文化和教育工作者努力不断教育年青一代，并且热情地为人民服务。
    胡志明主席指出：我们已经取得许多胜利。但是为了巩固和平、完成统一和实现独立和民主，我们仍须进行长期而艰巨的斗争。因此，我们必须经常保持高度的警惕性，加强我们的战斗精神，努力完成我们的任务，不应自满或自负。
