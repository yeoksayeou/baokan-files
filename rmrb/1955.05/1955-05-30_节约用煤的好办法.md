Good Ways to Save Coal
　　Chen Rongjie

The State-owned Xinhua No. 1 Salt Factory and the Joint State-Private Jiuda Salt Company in Zigong City, Sichuan Province, have successfully experimented with the Soviet expert Martiyanov's suggestion of using "anti-smoke scale agent" to prevent smoke scale in the salt-making workshop's flat pans and the brine-extracting workshop's boilers, respectively. If this advanced experience is fully promoted in these two factories, more than 4,000 tons of coal, worth 120,000 yuan, can be saved annually. If it is fully promoted in the Zigong salt area, more than 10,000 tons of coal can be saved every year.

The smoke scale formed by coal combustion in boilers and various evaporation equipment hinders heat transfer more severely than water scale. According to the preliminary experiments of Zigong Jiuda Salt Company, if both water scale and smoke scale are one micron thick, water scale wastes 2% of fuel, and smoke scale wastes 4%. Therefore, preventing smoke scale is one of the most effective ways to save coal.

The "anti-smoke scale agent" contains the following ingredients: 70% sodium chloride, and 7.5% each of ammonium chloride, calcium sulfate, copper sulfate, and sodium sulfate. Mix them evenly according to this ratio, and one to one and a half kilograms are enough for every 100 square meters of heating area per day. When using it, first close the damper of the boiler or other evaporation equipment for about one to two minutes to greatly reduce ventilation, so as to prevent the agent from escaping into the chimney with the wind before sufficient chemical changes have taken place. Then, put the prepared agent in through the furnace door and spread it evenly on the red-hot fire bed to allow it to fully react chemically. After fifteen minutes, open the damper and continue to stoke the fire.

　　节约用煤的好办法
　　陈荣堦
    四川自贡市国营新华第一制盐厂和公私合营久大制盐公司，采用苏联专家马尔季扬诺夫提出的以“防烟垢剂”防止烟垢的建议，分别在制盐车间的平锅和汲卤车间的锅炉上试验成功了。这个先进经验如果在这两个厂全面推广，全年可节约四千多吨煤，价值十二万元。如果在自贡盐区全面推广，每年可节省一万多吨煤。
    锅炉和各种蒸发设备中由煤炭燃烧所形成的烟垢，妨碍传热的程度比水锈更严重。根据自贡久大制盐公司的初步试验，如水锈与烟垢同为一毫微米厚时，水锈浪费燃料为百分之二，烟垢为百分之四。因此防止烟垢是节约用煤的很有效的方法之一。
      “防烟垢剂”所含的成分是：氯化钠百分之七十，氯化氨、硫酸钙、硫酸铜、硫酸钠各百分之七点五。照这样的比例混合均匀，每一百平方公尺加热面积每天使用一到一点五公斤就够了。使用时，要先将锅炉或其他蒸发设备的风门插板关闭约
  一至二分钟，使通风大量减少，以免药剂未经充分化学变化就随风逸出烟囱。然后将事先准备好的药剂由炉门投入，均匀地撒布在赤热的火床面上，使它充分发生化学反应。经过十五分钟后，打开风门插板，就可以继续生火。
