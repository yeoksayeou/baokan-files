Friend, have you been to Chengjiang?

Dear friend:

	Have you been to Chengjiang?

	When the warm spring breeze blows into the Chengjiang mandarin orange production area of Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, the tips of the orange trees are covered with lush green leaves, swaying like a green sea in the spring breeze; snow-white, fragrant orange blossoms bloom all over the branches, as if a thick layer of frost has been pressed onto the orange groves. People familiar with orange production will be happy to predict: "This year will be another year of bumper harvest."

	Now is the season when the yellow spider mite, the main pest of mandarin oranges, grows and becomes harmful. In order to completely eliminate the pests and ensure a bumper harvest this year, the orange farmers have made full preparations long ago. For example, Xiaoyou Township, which produces a large number of mandarin oranges, has prepared eighty-three sprayers and nearly two thousand catties of 666 powder, and has sprayed two-thirds of the orange groves in five days; the Advanced Agricultural Cooperative completed the spraying task two days ahead of schedule. The orange farmers are full of confidence and strive to completely eliminate the pests within two years. From morning to dusk, from the banks of Chengjiang to the depths of the orange groves, the "sizzling" sound of the sprayers and the cheerful songs of labor echo. Listen! In the orange grove, I don't know whose girl is singing a beautiful song again: White Flower Islet on the edge of the Great River, green orange groves and flowing river water, orange blossoms are white in spring, and mandarin oranges are red in December. The sun rises and the sky is red, eliminate pests and ensure a bumper harvest, the orange growers are organized, and White Flower Islet will become a golden and silver islet!

	The orange farmers clearly remember that before liberation, the difference between the large and small harvest years of mandarin oranges was very large: in the small harvest years, the orange blossoms were sparse and scattered, and some orange groves did not grow enough mandarin oranges for the orange growers to eat their fill, and some even had no harvest at all. In the past, no one dared to imagine that mandarin oranges would not have the difference between large and small harvest years. But after liberation, things changed so quickly. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, under the promotion of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and with the strong support of the working class elder brothers, the orange farmers have been engaged in continuous pest and weed control, fertilization and mud application, and pruning of branches, and the difference between large and small harvest years has been significantly reduced. Take the Advanced Agricultural Cooperative of Xiaoyou Township as an example! In 1952, the year of a large harvest, the yield of mandarin oranges per mu in this cooperative was 1,800 catties; in 1953, the year of a small harvest, it reached 2,147 catties per mu, an increase of 19% compared to 1952; this year is also a small harvest year, and the yield per mu is estimated to increase by more than 20% compared to 1953. People living in the orange-growing area believe that in the near future, the difference between large and small harvest years of mandarin oranges will only become a thing of the past to be recalled.

	Exporting one more ton of mandarin oranges can be exchanged for two more tons of steel. The contribution of increasing the production of mandarin oranges to national construction is so great! The orange farmers also know clearly that if it were not for the development of national industry in recent years, it would not have been possible to obtain so many sprayers, 666 powder and chemical fertilizers, and it would not have been possible to achieve continuous increases in production. They deeply realize that their happy life is closely linked to industrial development.

### 朋友，你到过澄江吗？

　　朋友，你到过澄江吗？亲爱的朋友：
    你到过澄江吗？
    当着温暖的春风，吹到了浙江黄岩县澄江桔产区的时候，桔子梢头盛发着绿油油的嫩叶，像一片绿色的海在春风中摇摆动荡；雪白、芬芳的桔花开得满枝，像给桔林压上了厚厚的一层霜。熟悉桔子生产的人都会高兴地预感到：“今年又是一个丰收年”。
    现在，正是桔果主要害虫黄癞虫成长为害的季节。为了彻底消灭虫害，保证今年丰收，桔农早就进行了充分的准备。如产桔较多的孝友乡准备了八十三架喷雾器和近两千斤六六六粉，在五天内就喷射了三分之二的桔园；先进农业社比计划提前两天完成了喷射任务。桔农们满怀信心，争取在二年内把虫害彻底消灭光。从早晨到黄昏，从澄江岸畔到桔林深处，都响着喷雾器“丝、丝”的喷射声和愉快的劳动歌声。请听！桔林里不知谁家姑娘又唱起了动听的歌儿：大江边上白花洲，桔林青青江水流，春来桔花一片白，腊月桔子红满洲。太阳上山红满天，除光虫害保丰收，种桔的人们组织起，白花洲要变金银洲！
    桔农清楚地记得，解放前，桔果的大小年相差得很大：每逢小年的时候，桔花开得寥寥落落，有些桔园长起的桔子还不够种桔的人们吃饱一肚，有的甚至毫无收成。过去谁也不敢想像，桔子会没有大小年的差别。但是解放后，事情变化得这么快，在党和政府领导下，在苏联专家热情指导下，在互助合作组织推动下，在工人老大哥大力支持下，桔农连年进行除虫除草，施肥加泥，整枝修枝，大小年的差别已显著缩小了。就拿孝友乡先进农业社来说吧！一九五二年这个社的桔子逢到大年，每亩桔子的产量是一千八百斤；一九五三年是小年，每亩却达到二千一百四十七斤，比一九五二年增产百分之十九；今年也是小年，每亩产量估计比一九五三年又可增产百分之二十以上。生活在桔区的人们都相信：不久的将来，桔子大小年差别将只能成为往事来回忆了。
    多出口一吨桔子，就可多换回二吨钢铁，增产桔子对国家建设的贡献是多么大啊！桔农更清楚地知道：几年来若不是国家工业的发展，就不可能得到这么多的喷雾器、六六六粉和化学肥料，也就不可能获得连年增产。他们深深体会到，他们的幸福生活是同工业发展紧密地联系在一起的。　卢秀灿
