　　Comprehensive Soil and Water Conservation Survey Team for the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Begins Work
    After members of the Comprehensive Soil and Water Conservation Survey Team for the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River, composed of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other relevant departments, gathered in Taiyuan from Beijing, Nanjing, and other places, they departed on the 25th to carry out work in western Shanxi. This year, they will conduct various surveys and research related to soil and water conservation in a narrow area of more than 20,000 square kilometers in western Shanxi, extending from the eastern bank of the Yellow River in the west to the Lüliang Mountains in the east, to collect scientific data for the first phase of the Yellow River development project and soil and water conservation planning and design in the western mountainous areas of Shanxi. They will also summarize the soil and water conservation experiences of local farmers and provide principled and crucial soil and water conservation advice.
    The survey team is headed by Ma Rongzhi, Director of the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Lin Rong, Deputy Director of the Institute of Botany, as the captain and deputy captain, respectively. It is composed of scientific workers in botany, soil science, geology, geography, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy engineering, economics, and other fields, forming specialized groups. In addition to the relevant institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the team includes members from the Research Institute of Forestry Science, the North China Institute of Agricultural Science, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Beijing Agricultural University, Peking University, Nanjing University, Northwest University, Lanzhou University, and others, totaling more than 100 people.
    Before the survey team set off, they made full preparations in Beijing, Taiyuan, and other places, and the relevant departments provided extensive support and assistance. Responsible cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation departments of Shanxi Province introduced the relevant situation to the work team in detail and transferred cadres from the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Jinan, Xinxian, and Yuci special districts to assist in the work.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　黄河中游水土保持综合考察队开始工作
    由中国科学院和其他有关部门组成的黄河中游水土保持综合考察队的成员，从北京、南京等地到太原集中后，二十五日出发到山西西部进行工作。今年他们将在山西西部西至黄河东岸、东至吕梁山约两万多平方公里的狭长地带进行有关水土保持的各项调查研究工作，为开发黄河第一期工程和山西西部山区的水土保持规划、设计搜集科学资料；并总结当地农民水土保持的经验，提供原则性和关键性的水土保持意见。
    考察队由中国科学院土壤研究所所长马溶之、植物研究所副所长林镕分别担任正、副队长，并由植物学、土壤学、地质学、地理学、农业、林业、水利工程、经济学等方面的科学工作者分别组成各专业组。参加工作队的除中国科学院各有关研究所外，还有林业科学研究所、华北农业科学研究所、黄河水利委员会、北京农业大学、北京大学、南京大学、西北大学、兰州大学等，全队总共一百多人。
    考察队出发前，曾在北京、太原等地进行了充分的准备，各有关部门给予多方面支持和帮助。中共山西省委员会和山西省农、林、水利及水土保持部门的负责干部向工作队详细介绍了有关情况，并抽调水利局和晋南、忻县、榆次专署的干部协助工作。　（新华社）
