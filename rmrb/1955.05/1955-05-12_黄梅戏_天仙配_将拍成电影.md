The Huangmei Opera "The Fairy Couple," performed by the Anhui Province Huangmei Opera Troupe, will be filmed in Shanghai. This opera won the first prize for script and the excellent performance award at the East China Regional Opera Festival in 1954. The leading actors, Yan Fengying and Wang Shaofang, also won first prize for actors at the East China Regional Opera Festival. The screenplay is adapted from the original opera by Sang Hu, and the first draft of the screenplay has been written and is being further revised. The film screenplay is more mythical, and many plots that cannot be performed on the stage can be expressed in the film. The original opera takes about three hours, but the adapted film screenplay will only take about one and a half hours to perform.

"The Fairy Couple" is an anti-feudal and anti-oppression historical drama with a moving plot; the songs and dances of the fairy in the play are very beautiful.

　　黄梅戏“天仙配”将拍成电影
    安徽省黄梅戏剧团演出的神话剧“天仙配”，将在上海拍摄成电影片。这个剧，曾在一九五四年获得华东区戏曲观摩演出大会剧本一等奖和优秀演出奖。主要演员严凤英和王少舫也曾获得华东区戏曲观摩演出大会演员奖一等奖。电影剧本是由桑弧根据原剧改编的，剧本初稿已经写出，正在进一步修改中。电影剧本更加富有神话色彩，许多在戏剧舞台上无法表演的情节，在电影中将可表现出来。原剧约需三小时，改编后的电影剧本只约需一小时半即可演完。
      “天仙配”是一个反封建、反压迫的古装剧，剧情动人；剧中仙女的歌舞，十分优美。
