　　Record of Discussions on Economic Cooperation at the Asian-African Conference
　　Zou Si'yi
      (I)
    Asia and Africa possess sixteen hundred million industrious and intelligent people, vast territories, and abundant resources, producing 96 percent of the world's rice, 99 percent of tea, 95 percent of rubber, 96 percent of jute, 62 percent of tin, 61 percent of peanuts, and many other important materials. However, the vast majority of the people of Asia and Africa have not reaped the fruits of happiness they deserve from their superior natural conditions. For centuries, under the devastation of colonialism, the economies of most countries have stagnated and lagged behind, and the lives of the people have become increasingly impoverished.
    After the Second World War, many Asian and African countries successively broke free from the political shackles of imperialism and embarked on the road of independent development. One of the tasks of the twenty-nine Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung was to study how Asian and African countries could cooperate on this road to get rid of economic backwardness.
    On April 18, the first plenary session of the Asian-African Conference decided to establish an Economic Committee to specifically discuss economic issues in the Asian-African region. The Economic Committee began three days of extensive discussions on April 19. The atmosphere at the meeting was always warm, and the scope of discussion was broad, ranging from technical assistance, investment issues, development of trade, payment issues, transportation issues, to the peaceful use of atomic energy. Although the representatives held different views on certain issues, the representatives of the twenty-nine countries on the Economic Committee unanimously adopted the economic report, reflecting the common desire of the people of all countries to seek economic cooperation. The main content of this report was included in the resolution on economic cooperation in the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference. Many representatives could not help but be surprised that these agreements could be reached in such a short period of three days. The Burmese representative said that he had attended many international conferences and had never seen a report that could be adopted so unanimously. The Japanese representative recalled that the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which was held in Tokyo a few weeks ago, could not reach an agreement so easily.
      (II)
    The first two sentences of the first paragraph of the economic cooperation resolution state: "The Asian-African Conference recognizes the urgency of promoting economic development in the Asian-African region. There is a universal desire among the participating countries to implement economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty." Economic cooperation based on mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty is in stark contrast to imperialist economic aggression and plunder. When discussing this issue, the Chinese representative pointed out in his speech: "It is necessary for Asia and Africa to advocate an independent and autonomous economy. Only on this basis can our economic cooperation gradually develop." Without an independent and autonomous economy, there would be no equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. The vast majority of Asian and African countries, which have long suffered from colonial rule, can deeply appreciate this point. For example, to this day, the oil resources of many Middle Eastern countries are still in the hands of imperialists. The oil mining rights in Indonesia are also still in the hands of foreigners. Therefore, when talking about economic independence, many representatives think of the oil issue. The Asian-African Conference also held a special discussion on this issue and adopted a resolution urging oil-producing countries in the Asian-African region to further "lead to the formulation of common policies" on the basis of exchanging information.
    Mutual benefit and mutual respect for sovereignty should be the basis of all economic cooperation. This provision of the resolution demonstrates the common demands of the people of Asia and Africa. The issue of investment and economic assistance from countries outside the region was also discussed at the meeting. The vast majority of representatives are well aware of the fact that imperialist countries use investment and assistance to carry out political and economic aggression. The representative of Liberia said that they could sign investment agreements with foreign countries, but they must not be attached to any conditions of political interference. In order to undermine the Asian-African Conference and the economic cooperation of Asian-African countries, the US government publicized during the Asian-African Conference that it would provide large amounts of assistance to Asian countries, and some American journalists were ordered to specifically visit many delegations, asking them to express their attitudes, attempting to threaten them not to oppose the notorious "US aid." However, countries that have tasted "US aid" have expressed great concerns and anxieties about "US aid." The Burmese representative said directly at the meeting that Burma did not want "US aid." Some representatives hoped that assistance could be arranged through international organizations, and said that assistance through bilateral arrangements often puts recipient countries at a disadvantage, easily creating conditions unfavorable to the recipient countries. Many countries share this feeling, so they specifically proposed the hope that assistance funds could be arranged through the United Nations or other international organizations. In fact, whether assistance is beneficial does not depend on whether it is arranged through bilateral means or through an international organization, but mainly depends on the nature and purpose of the assistance. For example, the cooperative relations between China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries in the economic field are based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty, demonstrating a sincere desire to help each other and achieve universal economic upturn. The trade agreements signed between China and several Asian neighboring countries, and the Soviet Union's assistance to India in building a factory producing one million tons of steel per year are all based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty, which is fundamentally different from "US aid" attached with military-political privileges.
      (III)
    The most heated discussion at the meeting was on how to change the colonial economic structure and how to stabilize the export prices of raw materials in Asian and African countries. This is quite understandable. Due to the long-term economic plunder policies of Western colonial countries, many Asian and African countries, including some that have already become independent, still suffer deeply from the scourge of colonialism in their economies. The entire economy of many countries depends on the export of a very small number of raw materials, and most of their civilian necessities and industrial products rely on foreign supplies. Imperialism can arbitrarily raise the prices of industrial products and lower the export prices of raw materials from Asian and African countries to extract maximum profits. This makes it extremely difficult for domestic industries to develop and extremely difficult for financial and economic stability.
    To fundamentally change dependence on imperialism, it is necessary to implement industrialization. Asian and African countries all urgently have this desire, but because the influence of the colonial economy is deeply rooted, changing the colonial economic structure and developing one's own industry cannot be done in the short term. Therefore, they currently urgently hope that their raw material exports can be guaranteed to some extent, both in terms of price and sales volume. China sympathizes with the aspirations of these countries. The Chinese representative stated at the meeting: "The prices of international raw material markets should be stabilized on a reasonable basis," and the specific method is to "sign long-term purchase and sale agreements or contracts with each other based on the needs and possibilities of both buyers and sellers, and the principle of equality and mutual benefit." This proposal was supported by many representatives. In fact, the Sino-Ceylonese Rice-Rubber Agreement and the Sino-Burmese Rice-Barter Agreement were implemented according to this proposal. The Economic Committee unanimously adopted these proposals and announced in the final communiqué: "The Asian-African Conference recommends that participating countries take collective action to stabilize international prices and needs of raw material commodities through bilateral and multilateral arrangements."
      (IV)
    The three-day meeting of the Economic Committee was filled with an atmosphere of demanding mutual cooperation and mutual assistance. Individual representatives tried their best to belittle the possibility of cooperation between Asian and African countries, but were refuted by everyone. The Indian government's document on economic cooperation prepared before the meeting stated: Too little attention has been paid to mutual assistance between Asian and African countries. There are many areas where our countries can cooperate. Our people are hardworking, the land is vast, and the resources are abundant. We can solve the problem of accumulating funds and mastering technology through self-reliance and mutual assistance. This is the material basis for our economic cooperation. The experience of New China's construction over the past five years has proven that the people of Asia and Africa can and can only rely on their own strength and mutual support on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty to achieve an independent position economically. As long as we have the desire to cooperate, we have a way to cooperate. Many representatives at the meeting expressed that economic cooperation between Asian and African countries is possible. This was a great encouragement to some representatives who lacked confidence.
    First of all, in terms of technical cooperation, as the Indian representative pointed out, the so-called "brilliant" technology of Western countries is not necessarily suitable for Asian and African countries. A Burmese official said that three years ago, Burma purchased new textile machines from the United States, but they could only spin American cotton and not Burmese short-staple cotton. To carry out production, it is necessary to rely on the United States even for raw materials. The Chinese representative proposed at the meeting that Asian and African countries should exchange the technologies and experiences they have created themselves, and China is willing to exchange technologies and experiences, provide experts, and train experts with Asian and African countries. This opinion was supported by representatives from India, Japan, Ceylon, and other countries. The communiqué also affirmed that countries provide technical assistance to each other.
      (V)
    The most important item in economic cooperation is the development of normal trade relations between Asian and African countries. The representatives all agreed that intra-regional trade had not received the development it deserved. However, the development of trade has suffered major obstacles. Representatives from Indonesia, India, Burma, and other countries pointed out the difficulties caused by the US "blockade" and "embargo" against China for other countries. The Indonesian representative said that the embargo against China should be removed. The Indian representative said: India believes that it is very necessary to remove the US embargo against China because India wants to develop trade relations with China. The Burmese representative said: Burma supports reconsidering the United Nations resolution on the embargo against China. China can export many things, and many countries very much hope to trade with China. These righteous calls received the sympathy of the participating representatives, and no one dared to defend the US blockade and embargo policy head-on. During the short seven-day conference, representatives from Egypt, Syria, India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan and other countries held talks with the Chinese delegation, expressing their desire to develop trade with each other. The US embargo policy cannot hinder China's economic construction in the slightest, but it is becoming increasingly unpopular and more isolated.
    On the issue of developing intra-regional trade, the Chinese representative's proposal to "increase the mutual dispatch of trade delegations between countries and hold international industrial and commercial exhibitions" was consistent with the views of many country representatives. These provisions were made in the resolution. China has participated in exhibitions in Syria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other countries in the past. Recently, an agreement has been reached with Japan to hold exhibitions in both countries. In recent years, many trade delegations and businessmen from Asian and African countries have visited China. China has also sent trade delegations to visit India and Indonesia. Through the resolution of the Asian-African Conference, more exhibitions can be held in the Asian-African region in the future. More trade delegations will travel to and from each other. This is beneficial to promoting trade and increasing cooperation.
      (VI)
    On the issue of shipping, the conference condemned some Western shipping companies for deliberately increasing freight rates within the Asian-African region and demanded improvement. The Chinese representative pointed out on the issue of shipping: "At present, the pirate acts of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the support of the United States, arbitrarily robbing ships on the high seas and sabotaging shipping are a serious threat to international shipping, which is intolerable and must be stopped." No country's representative defended the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's piracy.
    The resolution on economic cooperation also expressed the special significance of developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy for economically backward Asian and African countries. Many representatives realized that atomic energy can open up new avenues for resource development and large-scale construction. Atomic energy used for peaceful purposes can bring unlimited hope to mankind. Used for war, it will cause great destruction. The Japanese representative vividly described the tragic scene of Japan being bombed by atomic bombs. The people of Asia and Africa will always remember that the first to suffer from atomic weapons were Asian countries, and opposing the use of atomic energy for war is the unanimous desire of Asian and African countries.
      (VII)
    The discussion on economic cooperation at the Asian-African Conference affirmed the common desire of twenty-nine countries with different social and economic systems to implement peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation, and also affirmed the principles of mutual assistance and cooperation based on equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty, thus opening up new avenues for Asian and African countries to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation in the economic field. During the conference, the discussions within the conference and the contacts outside the conference promoted mutual understanding between Asian and African countries and strengthened mutual ties. There is no doubt that these achievements of the Asian-African Conference will greatly promote economic cooperation and friendly relations between Asian and African countries, thereby contributing to safeguarding world peace and maintaining the common cause of national independence.
    The United States' attempts to undermine the Asian-African Conference and split Asian and African countries have been clearly defeated. However, it will not relax its destructive conspiracy against the development of economic cooperation and friendly relations between Asian and African countries. In order to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and consolidate the achievements that the Asian-African Conference has already made, it is still up to the unremitting efforts of the people of Asian and African countries.

　　记亚非会议关于经济合作的讨论
　　邹斯颐
      （一）
    亚非两洲拥有十六亿勤劳而智慧的人民，地大物博，生产着占世界产量百分之九十六的大米、百分之九十九的茶叶、百分之九十五的橡胶、百分之九十六的黄麻、百分之六十二的锡、百分之六十一的花生和许多别的重要物资。但是绝大多数的亚非人民并没有从它们优越的自然条件获得应有的幸福的果实。近几世纪来，在殖民主义的摧残下，大多数国家的经济停滞落后，人民的生活日益贫困。
    第二次世界大战后许多亚非国家相继摆脱了帝国主义政治上的束缚，开始走上了独立发展的道路。二十九个亚非国家在万隆集会的任务之一就是要研究在这条道路上亚非各国怎样合作，来摆脱经济落后的问题。
    四月十八日亚非会议第一次全体大会决定成立经济委员会专门讨论亚非地区的经济问题。经济委员会从四月十九日开始进行了三天广泛的讨论。会场的空气一直很热烈，讨论的范围很广，从技术援助、投资问题、发展贸易、支付问题、运输问题，一直到原子能的和平使用都谈到了。尽管代表们在某些问题上持有不同的看法，经济委员会二十九个国家的代表还是一致通过经济报告，反映了各国人民要求经济合作的共同愿望。这个报告的主要内容都列入了亚非会议最后公报关于经济合作的决议里面。在短短的三天内，竟能达成这些协议，不能不使很多代表感到惊奇。缅甸代表说，他参加了很多国际性的会议，从来没有看见过一个报告能够这样一致地通过。日本代表回忆几星期前在东京召开的联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会就不能这样容易地达成协议。
      （二）
    经济合作决议第一段头两句话就说：“亚非会议认识到促进亚非区域的经济发展的迫切性。在与会国中存有在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作的普遍愿望。”互利和互相尊重国家主权的经济合作同帝国主义的经济侵略和掠夺正是一个鲜明的对照。在讨论这一问题时，我国代表在发言中指出：“亚非两洲有必要倡导独立自主的经济，只有在这样的基础上，我们的经济合作方能逐步发展。”没有独立自主的经济就不会有平等互利的合作。绝大多数亚非国家曾经长期遭受过殖民主义的统治，都能深深地体会这点。例如，至今，很多中近东国家的石油资源还是掌握在帝国主义的手中。印度尼西亚的石油开采权也仍然在外国人手上。因此谈到经济独立，很多代表就想到石油问题。亚非会议还专就这问题进行了讨论，并作出了决议敦促亚非地区的石油生产国家能在交换情报的基础上进一步“导向共同政策的制订”。
    互利和互相尊重主权应该是一切经济合作的基础。决议的这个规定表明亚非人民普遍的共同要求。在会议上也讨论到区外国家的投资和经济援助的问题。绝大多数的代表熟知帝国主义国家利用投资和援助来实行政治和经济侵略的事实。利比里亚的代表就说，他们可以同外国签订投资的协定，但是必须不附带任何政治干涉的条件。为了破坏亚非会议和亚非国家的经济合作，美国政府在亚非会议期间大肆宣传将给亚洲国家大量援助，一些美国记者并且奉命特别访问了许多代表团，要他们表示态度，企图威胁他们不要反对臭名昭彰的“美援”。但是尝过“美援”滋味的国家，对“美援”流露出很大的顾虑和不安。缅甸代表在会议上就直截了当地说，缅甸不要“美援”。有的代表希望经过国际机构来安排援助，并且说通过双边安排的援助，往往使受援国处于不利的地位，很容易造成不利于受援国的条件。很多国家也有同感，因此特别提出希望通过联合国或者其他国际机构安排资金的援助。其实，援助是否有利，不决定于通过双边形式还是通过某个国际机构的安排，主要的还是决定于援助的本质和目的。例如，中国、苏联及其他人民民主国家间在经济方面的合作关系，便是建立在平等互利、互相尊重国家主权的基础上面，表现了互相帮助和取得普遍的经济高涨的真诚愿望。中国和几个亚洲邻邦所签订的贸易协定，苏联和印度关于建设年产一百万吨钢的工厂的援助都是以平等互利和尊重国家主权的原则为基础，这同附带军事政治的特权条件的“美援”有着本质上的差别。
      （三）
    在会议中讨论最热烈的就是如何改变殖民地型的经济结构，如何稳定亚非国家的原料出口价格。这是很可理解的。由于西方殖民国家长期的经济掠夺政策，许多亚非国家，包括某些已经独立国家在内，在经济上仍然深受殖民主义的祸害。许多国家的整个经济依赖于极少数品种的原料的出口，他们的大部分民用必需品及工业品都要依靠外国的供应。帝国主义可以随心所欲地抬高工业品的价格，压低亚非国家原料出口价格来榨取最大利润。这使本国工业极难发展，财政经济极难稳定。
    要根本改变对帝国主义的依赖就要实行工业化，亚非国家都迫切地具有这个愿望，但是由于殖民经济的影响是根深蒂固，要改变殖民经济结构、发展自己的工业不是短期内所能办到的。因此他们目前迫切希望他们原料的出口，不论价格上或者销售数量上都能得到些保障。中国对于这些国家的愿望是同情的。我国代表在会上发言表示：“国际原料市场的价格应该在合理的基础上求得稳定”，具体的办法是“根据买卖双方的需要和可能以及平等互利的原则，相互之间签订长期的买卖协定或合同”。这个主张得到了很多代表的支持。事实上，中锡大米橡胶协定和中缅大米换货协定就是按照这个主张执行的。经济委员会一致采纳了这些主张，并在最后公报中宣布：“亚非会议建议：与会国采取集体行动，通过双边安排和多边安排来稳定原料商品的国际价格和需要。”
      （四）
    经济委员会的三天会议中充满了要求互相合作，要求互相帮助的气氛。个别代表别有用心地竭力要想贬低亚非国家之间合作的可能，却遭到了大家的驳斥。印度政府在会前准备的经济合作的文件中表明：亚非国家之间相互帮助是注意得太少了。我们各国有很多地方是可以合作的。我们的人民是勤劳的，土地是广阔的，资源是丰富的。我们在积累资金和掌握技术方面是可以经过自力更生与互相帮助获得解决的。这就是我们进行经济合作的物质基础。五年来，新中国建设的经验证明，亚非人民完全可以并且只有依靠自己的力量和在平等互利与尊重国家主权基础上互相支援，才能在经济上达到独立地位。我们只要有合作的愿望，就有合作的道路。会议上很多代表表示亚非国家之间的经济合作是有可能的。这对有些信心不足的代表们是一个很大的鼓舞。
    首先，在技术合作上，正如印度代表指出的，所谓西方国家的“高明”技术倒不一定适合于亚非国家。一位缅甸官员说，三年前缅甸向美国购买了新式的纺织机，但是只能纺美国棉花而不能纺缅甸短绒棉花，要进行生产，就得连原料也依靠美国。我国代表在会议上提出亚非各国交流自己创造的技术和经验，中国愿意同亚非国家交流技术、经验，供给专家、训练专家。这个意见得到了印度、日本、锡兰等国代表的支持。公报中也肯定了各国互相提供技术援助。
      （五）
    经济合作中最重要的一项，就是发展亚非国家间正常的贸易关系。代表们都认为区内的贸易没有得到应有的发展。但发展贸易却遭受了重大障碍。印度尼西亚、印度、缅甸等国代表指出了美国对中国的“封锁”、“禁运”给其他国家所造成的困难。印度尼西亚代表说对中国的禁运应该去除。印度代表说：印度认为有非常必要去除美国对中国的禁运，因为印度要同中国发展贸易关系。缅甸代表说：缅甸支持重新考虑联合国对中国禁运的决议，中国能出口很多东西，许多国家都非常希望同中国进行贸易。这些正义的呼声得到与会代表的同情，没有人敢于正面地为美国的封锁禁运政策辩护。在短短的七天会议期间，埃及、叙利亚、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦等国代表都同我国代表团进行洽谈，表示发展彼此之间贸易的愿望。美国的禁运政策并不能丝毫阻碍我国的经济建设，但却日益不得人心而变得更加孤立了。
    在发展区域内贸易问题上，我国代表提出的“增加各国间互派贸易代表团，举行国际性的工商展览”的建议，是同许多国家代表的主张一致的。决议中就作了这些规定。中国过去参加了叙利亚、印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚等国的展览会。最近又和日本达成协议在两国举办展览。最近几年来很多亚非国家的贸易代表团和商人曾访问我国。中国也派出了访印度、印度尼西亚的贸易代表团。通过亚非会议的决议，今后亚非地区内将能举办更多的展览会。有更多的贸易代表团互相往来。这对于促进贸易，增加合作都是有利的。
      （六）
    在航运问题上，会议对有些西方国家的轮船公司故意提高亚非区域内的运费提出谴责，并要求改善。我国代表在航运问题上指出：“目前蒋匪帮在美国支持下，在公海上随意抢劫船只，破坏航运的海盗行为是国际航运的严重威胁，是不能容忍的也是必须制止的。”没有一个国家的代表为蒋匪帮的海盗行为辩护。
    在经济合作的决议中还表达了发展原子能的和平用途对经济落后的亚非国家的特殊意义。很多代表认识到原子能能够为开发资源，大规模建设开辟新道路。原子能用于和平能为人类带来无限希望。用于战争就会造成巨大的破坏。日本代表很生动地叙述了日本受到原子弹爆炸的惨酷景象。亚非人民永远记得第一个受到原子武器的灾害的是亚洲国家，反对将原子能用于战争是亚非国家的一致愿望。
      （七）
    亚非会议关于经济合作的讨论，肯定了二十九个不同社会经济制度的国家实行和平相处、经济合作的共同愿望，也肯定了平等互利和尊重国家主权的互助合作的原则，这样就为亚非各国加强经济方面的互助合作开辟了新的道路。会议期间，通过会内的讨论与会外的接触，促进了亚非各国之间的互相了解，加强了相互间的联系。毫无疑问，亚非会议的这些成就必将大大促进亚非各国间的经济合作与友好关系，从而有利于保障世界和平，维护各国独立的共同事业。
    美国破坏亚非会议、分裂亚非国家的企图已遭到了明显的失败。但是，它对于亚非各国经济合作与友好关系的发展，是不会放松其破坏阴谋的。为了贯彻亚非会议的决议，巩固亚非会议所已经取得的成就，还有待于亚非各国人民坚持不懈的努力。
