　　Strengthen Learning, Raise Vigilance!
　　Lei Jia
　　The materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, revealed by the "People's Daily," have aroused the indignation of the people nationwide. From these materials, we know that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiratorial activities began twenty years ago, becoming even more rampant and insidious after liberation.
　　Now we must ask: Where did Hu Feng come from? Who is his master? His two-faced scheming methods, his "organizational principles," his dispatching of undercover agents, stealing documents, inquiring about situations, his arrangement of attacks, organizing retreats, the strategy of "preserving strength," and "raising travel expenses," etc. This whole set is no different from a hidden secret agent organization.
　　The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiratorial activities have finally been exposed before the Chinese people. But we must further make the Hu Feng elements crawl out into the sunlight, strip off their painted skins, and see what they really are! Make them understand: their conspiracies and tricks can never succeed before the Chinese people. Also, make them understand: it is absolutely impossible not to make a thorough confession before the Chinese people.
　　In 1949, when I was working in a factory, he visited the factory. Although I had never read his books, I regarded him as a "literary elder" at the time. I never knew that when he shook my hand, there was a rubber whip wrapped with steel wire behind his back; behind his disguised false smile, there was such a vicious curse hidden. Looking back today, this is so worthy of vigilance!
　　Recently, a wave of materialism learning has been sweeping across the country. We must earnestly respond to the Party's call and carry out learning in a planned way. From the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I have been deeply educated, making me realize that only by strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism can we improve our understanding and vigilance, so that the Hu Feng elements will have no place to hide, and our construction cause will advance victoriously.
　　Today, we are walking the road of socialist construction. This is the only correct road for the strong and long-tested Chinese Communist Party to lead our people towards prosperity by eliminating thousands of years of oppression. In order to defend every victory and every achievement in construction, we must pursue the victory, continue to expose the conspiracies and crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and remove all Hu Feng elements from our path forward.

　　加强学习，提高警惕！
　　雷加
    “人民日报”所揭露的胡风反动集团的材料，引起了全国人民的震怒。从这些材料上知道，胡风反动集团的阴谋活动，从二十年前就已开始，到了解放以后更加猖獗和阴毒了。
    现在我们要问：胡风是从哪里来的？他的主子是谁？他的两面派的阴谋活动方式，他的“组织原则”，他的派遣坐探，盗窃文件，探听情况的作法，他的布置进攻，组织退却，“保存力量”的策略，以及“筹措旅费”等，这一套和暗藏的特务组织，丝毫没有区别。
    胡风反动集团的阴谋活动，终于在中国人民面前揭露出来了。但是我们必须进一步地叫胡风分子爬到太阳底下来，剥去他们的画皮，看看到底是什么货色？叫他们明白：他们的阴谋诡计在中国人民面前是永远不能得逞的。也叫他们明白：在中国人民面前不做彻底的交代，也是绝对不行的。
    一九四九年我在工厂工作时，他曾到工厂参观过。虽然我从来没有读过他的书，当时我是把他当做“文艺界前辈”看待的。竟不知他同我握手时，他的背后还有一条包了钢丝的橡皮鞭子；在他的披着伪装的假笑后面，还包藏着这么毒狠的咒诅。今天回想起来，这是多么值得警惕呵！
    最近全国掀起了唯物主义的学习热潮，我们必须认真地响应党的号召，有计划地进行学习。我从胡风反动集团的揭露中，深深地得到了教育，使我知道只有加强马克思列宁主义的学习，才能提高认识和提高警惕，才能使胡风分子再无藏身之所，才能使我们的建设事业胜利地前进。
    今天我们走着社会主义建设的路，这是强大的久经锻炼的中国共产党领导我们全国人民，为了消灭千百年来的压迫走向富强的唯一正确的路。我们为了保卫建设中的每一个胜利和每一个成果，必需乘胜追击，继续揭露胡风反动集团的阴谋和罪行，把一切胡风分子从我们前进的道路上清除出去。
