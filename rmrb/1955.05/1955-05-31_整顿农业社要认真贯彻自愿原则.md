Rectifying Agricultural Cooperatives Must Seriously Implement the Principle of Voluntariness
He Jingchun
In the current work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, rural workers in some areas have some concerns about implementing the principle of voluntariness: some are afraid that doing so will reduce the proportion of cooperation, some are afraid of affecting the development of the cooperative movement, and others are afraid of losing face. Therefore, they have cancelled the principle of voluntariness in their actual work.

Zhao Shan, a member of the Yong Sheng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Qingcha Village, Tenth District, Huanan County, Heilongjiang Province, requested to withdraw from the cooperative. The village staff, fearing that "allowing the first withdrawal would be terrible," convened a meeting of cooperative members to discuss whether to allow the withdrawal. Zhou Liansheng, a member of the management committee, spoke first on behalf of the management committee: "Our cooperative is the most thorough in implementing the principle of voluntariness. Anyone who really doesn't want to be in the cooperative is allowed to withdraw. However, those who withdraw must bear two responsibilities: they will be responsible if the cooperative collapses, and they will be responsible for any other households that withdraw; after leaving the cooperative, they must act according to our words, and they must join whichever mutual aid team we tell them to join, and they are not allowed to refute." Then, an activist spoke: "Those who leave the cooperative want to sabotage it, and they should not be given freedom after leaving!" Zhao Shan was shocked when he heard this and said, "With this kind of rectification, I dare not withdraw from the cooperative!" Jiang Yonglu, a member of the Tuanjie Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the same district, withdrew from the cooperative, and the Tuanjie cooperative withheld his investment (20 yuan in cash, 800 jin of wheat seeds, 1200 jin of soybeans, 600 jin of horse feed, and 3600 jin of hay), not allowing him to take it away. Jiang Yonglu angrily said, "I will never join a cooperative again!" The district committee discovered these two incidents and has already corrected them. However, this problem has not been fundamentally solved.

This kind of political attack and economic restriction on withdrawing cooperative members seriously damages the production enthusiasm of local farmers. Doing so is bound to arouse farmers' doubts about the Party's policies; those farmers who remain in the cooperative will never be able to produce actively, and may even play a negative and demoralizing role in the cooperative, which will cause these agricultural producers' cooperatives to encounter various difficulties, leading to collapse and disbandment. Of course, it is a good thing to want a larger proportion of cooperation; however, if the proportion of cooperation is false, it will not be beneficial at all, but harmful. Is it "shameful" if someone withdraws from the cooperative as a result of implementing the principle of voluntariness? It can be said with certainty that it is definitely not "shameful"; insisting on mistakes, and ending up in a mess, that is more shameful! Only by truly explaining to the farmers the Party's principle of voluntary and mutually beneficial cooperation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and truly letting the policies meet the masses, will it be beneficial to the cooperative movement. If this is done, even if we cannot keep them now, because we respect their wishes today and do not hurt feelings, it will be easier to win them over to truly and voluntarily join the cooperative in the future. It should be believed that as long as the cooperative is run well, the farmers who have withdrawn will eventually return to the cooperative. The fact that some comrades dare not effectively implement the principle of voluntariness in the cooperative movement is precisely a manifestation of a lack of confidence in the inevitable victory of the cooperative cause.

    整顿农业社要认真贯彻自愿原则
    何景春
    在当前整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作当中，有些地方的农村工作人员对于贯彻自愿原则有一些顾虑：有的怕这样做会降低合作化的比重，有的怕影响合作化运动的发展，还有的怕自己丢脸。因此，他们在实际工作中就取消了自愿原则。
    黑龙江省桦南县十区清茶村永胜农业生产合作社社员赵山要求退社。村里的工作人员怕“退开头不得了”，就召开社员大会，讨论允不允许退社的问题。管理委员会委员周连生代表管理委员会首先发言：“我们社是最贯彻自愿原则的，哪个人实在不愿在社里，允许退社。可是，退社的人要负两条责任：社要垮台了由他负责，再有退社的户由他负责；出社以后一定要按我们的话办事，叫他上哪个互助组就得上哪个组，不许反驳。”接着，一个积极分子发言：“出社的人就是想破坏社，出社以后别给他自由！”赵山听了这番话，很吃惊地说：“这么一整，我算不敢退社啦！”这个区的团结农业生产合作社社员姜永禄退社了，团结社把他的投资（二十元现金，八百斤麦种，一千二百斤豆子，六百斤马料，三千六百斤谷草）扣留下来，不允许带走。姜永禄生气地说：“我再也不入社了！”区委发现了这两件事以后已经纠正了。但是，这个问题并没有从根本上得到解决。
    这种在政治上打击和在经济上限制退社社员的事情，严重地损害了当地农民的生产积极性。这样作，必然要引起农民对党的政策的怀疑；那些留在社内的农民，也决不可能积极生产，甚至会在社内起消极涣散的作用，会使这些农业生产合作社遇到各种困难，以致垮台散伙。想要合作化的比重大一些，这当然是好事情；可是，如果合作化的比重是虚假的，那就一点好处也没有，反而会有害处。贯彻自愿原则的结果假若有人退社是不是“丢脸”呢？可以肯定地说，那绝不是“丢脸”；坚持错误，到头来弄得不可收拾，那才更丢脸哩！只有向农民真正讲明党关于互助合作运动的自愿互利原则，真正让政策和群众见面，才对合作化运动有利。这样作了，即使现在留不住他们，可是，由于今天尊重了他们的意愿，不伤和气，就便于争取他们将来真正自愿地入社。应当相信，只要把社办好了，退社的农民终于是会再回到社里来的。有些同志不敢在合作化运动中切实地贯彻自愿原则，正是对合作化事业的必然胜利缺乏信心的表现。
