　　In the nation's socialist construction and socialist transformation, commercial work is playing an increasingly important role. How to do a good job in commercial work must arouse the universal attention of our Party and state personnel.

　　Why is commercial work becoming increasingly important? As far as the current situation is concerned, major agricultural products have implemented unified purchase and marketing, and 80 to 90 percent of daily-use industrial products are purchased by state-owned commercial enterprises. It is certainly difficult to purchase so many commodities, and it is even more difficult to distribute these commodities rationally. At present, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the supply of people's daily necessities and means of production, depends more on the strengthening of state-owned commercial work than at any time in the past. Commercial work has a significant impact on the development of industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives, and also has a significant impact on the worker-peasant alliance and the transformation of non-socialist economic components.

　　Looking at the situation in the past few years, commercial work has been complex and changeable. In order to develop China's commerce, the Party and the People's Government have done a lot of work and taken many important measures: in March 1950, in order to stabilize national prices, the important policy of national financial and economic unification was implemented. In June of the same year, with the disappearance of the false prosperity in the market, private industrial and commercial enterprises encountered difficulties in maintaining operations, and measures were taken to adjust industry and commerce. In 1951, private industrial and commercial enterprises achieved further development, and the "five poisons" of the bourgeoisie spread rampantly, fiercely attacking the working class. In order to repel this attack, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were launched nationwide. In 1952, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, private industrial and commercial operations experienced new difficulties, and the People's Government took the second measure to adjust commerce. In the first half of 1953, due to some improper measures in state-owned commerce and tax policies, the activities of private wholesalers were boosted for a time, and the stability of the market was affected, so some emergency measures had to be taken to stabilize the market. After that, with the announcement of the general line and the development of unified purchase and marketing, processing orders, and purchase and sales work, the free market was greatly reduced, the operation of private merchants underwent great changes, and some encountered new difficulties. In 1954, the People's Government made preliminary arrangements for private commerce, and it will be necessary to further consider the arrangement and transformation of private merchants in the future.

　　This series of facts shows that in the process of advancement, commercial work has almost new problems every year, and it takes a lot of energy to solve these problems each time. The occurrence of these problems reflects some contradictions in China's transition period, such as: agriculture cannot keep up with the needs of industrialization and improvement of people's lives; contradictions between farmers and the Party's socialist measures; a certain degree of resistance from the bourgeoisie to transformation; there is still a certain distance between the current status of industrial production and the needs of the people, etc. These contradictions will inevitably be manifested in the market. Therefore, not only can this situation not be completely avoided in the future, but new problems will inevitably arise. However, if we pay attention to commercial work, promptly pay attention to changing the shortcomings in our work, and solve some problems that we can solve, then we are fully capable of arranging commercial work better, so that problems do not occur or occur less frequently over a long period of time.

　　How should we attach importance to commercial work? What should be done currently to make good arrangements for commercial work?

　　First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of Party committees and state administrative organs at all levels over commercial work. This is the decisive link in arranging commercial work. With the development of national economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the tasks of commercial work are also becoming increasingly heavy. Every specific work measure of commercial work is closely related to industrial and agricultural production, class relations, and the lives of the vast number of people in urban and rural areas. It is both economic work and political work. At the same time, the commercial sector has a large organization and a large number of personnel (the number is even greater when including the employees of private commerce). Without the unified leadership of the Party committee and the attention of the entire Party, it is difficult to do a good job. In fact, the Party committees in various places spend a total of six to eight months a year doing unified purchase and marketing work, which is also specific commercial work. Therefore, regardless of needs or possibilities, Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of commercial work. The Central Committee has stipulated that financial and economic departments should be established in the Party's county committees and the Party committees of larger market towns, and one person should also be responsible for financial and economic work in district committees. This decision must be implemented quickly.

　　Secondly, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, state-owned commercial departments must assume the responsibility of unified leadership of the national market and implement the policy of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements. This means that we must proceed from the overall situation, properly divide the business scope and business areas of various economic components of commerce, correctly stipulate the proportion of public and private commercial operations, implement the policy of socialist transformation of private commerce, strive to study the national market situation and actively improve wholesale and retail business, and so on. In the past, due to the lack of overall planning thinking and investigation and research work in the commercial departments of some regions, there was a fairly widespread sense of impatience in the transformation of private commerce. They only wanted to replace it without arranging for transformation; they only wanted to take over everything without considering whether they could take over, resulting in difficulties for some private merchants to maintain operations and causing the phenomenon of "big flows and small blockages" in trade between cities and villages, which is extremely unfavorable to industrial and agricultural production and the basic policy of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This subjectivist approach must be corrected quickly. It should be recognized that the consolidation and growth of socialist commerce in the future cannot be limited to calculating the changes in the proportion of public and private sectors. At the same time, we should see the degree of leadership and transformation of private commerce. We must make good and comprehensive use of the manpower, experience and equipment of private commerce, actively lead them and transform them, so that they can serve the cause of socialist construction. As long as we can make good use of, restrict and transform private commerce, it will not only not weaken the strength of socialist commerce, but also further strengthen and consolidate the position of socialist commerce.

　　Again, it is necessary to do a good job in unified purchase and marketing, make it institutionalized, and quickly strengthen market management. Unified purchase and marketing commodities are commodities that are needed in large quantities in people's lives; unified purchase and marketing work is also a long-term work, and the success or failure of this work has a great impact on market stability. However, due to the fact that things are in their initial stage, the task is arduous, experience is insufficient, and it is still difficult to ascertain the production and sales situation, there is no complete system in actual work. Therefore, in the unified purchase and marketing of grain, it is inevitable that "output is overestimated and the amount of grain retained is too low," causing the masses to worry that "purchase and sale have no bottom." Now, the State Council has decided to further implement "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain on the basis of unified purchase and marketing. This work must be done well. Doing a good job in this work can effectively overcome the above shortcomings, make unified purchase and marketing work move towards institutionalization, and is conducive to the arrangement of commercial work. In terms of market management, the chaotic phenomena of arbitrarily stipulating regulations, arbitrarily increasing controls on commodities regardless of whether they are major or minor, and arbitrarily announcing unified purchase and marketing commodities must also be stopped immediately. Because the result of this practice is that it cannot truly manage the market well, but instead causes rural market management to be too strict and rigid, blocking the exchange of materials. In the future, unless otherwise instructed by the Central Committee, no locality or department has the right to stipulate the variety of unified purchase and marketing commodities.

　　Finally, it is necessary to further strengthen the commercial administrative organs and improve the operation and management work. At present, the organization of commercial administrative organs at all levels is unsound, especially the special commissioner's offices and counties do not have strong commercial administrative organs, so that the situation is not reflected in a timely manner, the command and dispatch are not flexible, and the existing commercial organizational form cannot fully adapt to objective requirements. Therefore, all localities must quickly further improve and strengthen the commercial administrative organs at the special and county levels, so that they can truly assume the responsibility of unified planning and arrangement of all commercial activities. In terms of improving operation and management, the most urgent task at present is to strengthen and improve wholesale work. This work must be done to a certain degree of success in 1955 according to the unified deployment of the Ministry of Commerce. At present, the phenomenon of waste in the operation and management of commercial departments is still very serious. All regions and professional companies must strive to further improve the quality of work in 1955 in terms of improving transportation and allocation, reducing commodity losses, improving procedures and systems, accelerating capital turnover, and reducing costs, according to the specific circumstances of different commodities and different regions, in order to accumulate funds for the country's socialist industrialization.

　　Of course, whether or not to attach importance to commercial work is also manifested in many aspects, but as long as the importance of commercial work is truly recognized, all other problems can be gradually resolved. We believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee and with the joint efforts of Party committees and commercial cooperative departments at all levels, we will definitely be able to further improve commercial work.

### 重视商业工作

　　重视商业工作
    在国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，商业工作日益增加了它的重要作用。如何做好商业工作，必须引起我们的党和国家工作人员的普遍重视。
    为什么商业工作越来越重要了呢？就目前的情况来看，主要的农产品已实行了统购统销，日用工业品的百分之八十到九十是由国营商业负责收购的，要采购这许多商品固然很困难，而合理地分配这些商品就还要困难。目前城乡物资的交流，人民生活用品和生产资料的供应，比之过去任何时候，都更有赖于国营商业工作的加强。商业工作对于工农业生产的发展和人民的生活有重大影响，对于工农联盟和非社会主义经济成份的改造工作也有重大的影响。
    就过去几年的情况来看，商业工作是复杂的、多变的。为了发展我国的商业，党和人民政府曾作了很多工作，采取了很多重要的措施：一九五○年三月，为了稳定全国物价，实行了全国财经统一的重要政策。同年六月，随着市场上虚假繁荣现象的消逝，私营工商业维持经营遇到了困难，采取了调整工商业的办法。一九五一年，私营工商业得到了进一步的发展，资产阶级五毒泛滥，猖狂地向工人阶级进攻，为了打退这种进攻，在全国范围内展开了“三反”、“五反”运动。一九五二年，“三反”“五反”以后，私营工商业的经营发生了新的困难，人民政府又第二次采取了调整商业的措施。一九五三年上半年，由于国营商业和税收政策的某些措施不当，一度助长了私营批发商的活跃，并影响市场的安定，又不得不采取一些紧急措施以稳定市场。其后，总路线的宣布和统购统销、加工订货、收购包销工作的发展，自由市场大大缩小了，私商经营发生了很大变化，有的又遇到了新的困难，一九五四年人民政府又对私营商业进行了初步安排，今后还必须进一步考虑安排和改造私商的问题。
    这一连串的事实，说明商业工作在前进中几乎每年都要发生一些新的问题，每次都要花费不少的精力去解决这些问题。这些问题的发生，反映了我国过渡时期的若干矛盾，例如：农业赶不上工业化和人民生活改善的需要；农民和党的社会主义措施之间的矛盾；资产阶级对改造的一定程度的抵抗；工业生产发展的现状和人民需要之间尚有一定的距离等。这些矛盾必然会在市场上表现出来。因此，今后这种情况不但不能完全避免，而且必然还会发生新的问题。但是，如果我们重视了商业工作，及时注意改变工作方面的缺点，解决一些我们能够解决的问题，那末我们完全有可能把商业工作安排得更好一些，使之在一个较长的时期内不发生问题，或者少发生一些问题。
    应该怎样去重视商业工作呢？为了很好地安排商业工作，当前应该作些什么呢？
    首先，就是加强各级党委和国家行政机关对商业工作的领导。这是安排商业工作决定性的一环。随着国家经济建设的发展和人民生活水平的提高，商业工作的任务也日益繁重。商业工作的每一具体工作措施，都和工农业生产、阶级关系，以及城乡广大人民生活有极密切的关系，它既是经济工作，又是政治工作。同时，商业部门的机构庞大，人员众多（将私营商业的从业人员计算在内，人数就更多），如果没有党委的统一领导和全党的重视，是很难作好工作的。事实上，现在各地党委一年总有半年到八个月在作统购统销工作，这也就是具体的商业工作。因此不论从需要或可能来说，各级党委都应该加强商业工作的领导。中央已经规定在党的县委和较大集镇的党委中成立财经部，区委也应有一人负责主管财经工作。这一个决定，必须迅速贯彻执行。
    其次，就是在各级党委的领导下，国营商业部门必须担负起统一领导全国市场的责任，贯彻统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针。这就是说，必须从全局观点出发，妥善地划分各种经济成份商业的经营范围和经营地区，正确地规定公私商业经营的比重和贯彻对私营商业社会主义改造的政策，努力研究全国市场情况并积极改进批发和零售业务等等。过去，若干地区的商业部门，由于缺乏统筹兼顾的思想和调查研究工作，对于私营商业的改造，相当普遍地存在着急躁情绪，只想代替，而不安排改造；只想包办，而不考虑包得了包不了，结果造成了部分私商维持经营的困难，也使城市和乡村的贸易发生“大通小塞”现象，这是极不利于工农业生产和巩固工农联盟的基本政策的。这种主观主义的做法，必须迅速纠正。应该认识到，今后社会主义商业的巩固和壮大，绝不能只是限于计算公私比重数字的变化，同时应看到对于私营商业领导和改造的程度。必须很好地全盘地利用私营商业的人力、经验和设备，积极领导他们并改造他们，使之为社会主义建设事业服务。只要我们能很好地利用、限制和改造私营商业，不仅不会削弱社会主义商业的力量，还会使社会主义商业的阵地进一步加强和巩固。
    再次，就是要做好统购统销工作，使之制度化，并迅速加强市场管理。统购统销的商品，是人民生活中大量需要的商品；统购统销工作又是一个较长时期的工作，这项工作做得好坏，对市场的稳定有极大的影响。但是，由于事属初创，任务艰巨，经验不足，对产销情况一时尚难摸清，在实际工作中尚无一套完整的制度，因而在粮食统购统销工作中，也就难免发生“产量估高，留粮偏低”的情况，使群众顾虑“购、销无底”。现在，国务院已决定在统购统销的基础上，进一步实行粮食的“定产、定购、定销”，这项工作必须做好。做好了这项工作，就可以有效地克服上述缺点，使统购统销工作走向制度化，并有利于商业工作的安排。在市场管理方面，各地不分主要或次要商品乱定规章、滥加管制，以及任意宣布统购统销商品的混乱现象也必须立即停止。因为这种做法的结果，既不能真正管好市场，反而造成农村市场管理过严过死、阻塞物资交流。今后，除非中央指示，任何地方任何部门都无权规定统购统销商品品种。
    最后，就是要进一步加强商业行政机构和改善经营管理工作。目前各级商业行政机构的组织是不健全的，特别是专署和县没有有力的商业行政机构，以致情况反映不及时，指挥调度不灵活，现有的商业组织形式还不能完全和客观要求相适应。因此各地必须迅速进一步健全和加强专、县级的商业行政机构，使之真正能够担负起统一计划和安排全部商业活动的责任。在改善经营管理方面，当前最迫切的任务就是加强并改进批发工作。这项工作必须根据商业部统一的部署，在一九五五年内做出一定成绩来。目前，商业部门经营管理中的浪费现象还很严重，各地区和各专业公司必须根据不同商品和不同地区的具体情况，争取在一九五五年内，在改善运输调拨、降低商品损耗、改进手续制度、加速资金周转、降低费用等方面，进一步提高工作质量，为国家的社会主义工业化积累资金。
    当然，是否重视商业工作，还表现在很多方面，但是，只要真正认识了商业工作的重要性，其他一切问题都是可以逐步解决的。我们相信，在中央的领导下，在各级党委和商业合作部门的共同努力下，我们是一定能进一步做好商业工作的。
