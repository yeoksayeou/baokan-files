The year 1955 marks the final spring of the Lushun-Dalian people’s joyous companionship with the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area.

Now, the Lushun-Dalian coast is bursting with blooming flowers. Gulls fly freely in the tranquil skies above the sea; in the distance, fishing boats dot the horizon. At dusk, young and robust Soviet sailors busily assist returning fishermen in pulling their boats and lifting their nets. In the fields, sturdy warhorses from the Soviet military units help farmers transport manure and till the land for spring planting. On Sundays and weekday evenings, the beaches, parks, and scenic mountain areas are filled with the joyous gatherings of the Chinese people and their Soviet friends.

In these days before departure, the people of Lushun-Dalian hold joint celebrations with their Soviet friends almost daily. At a get-together in a remote fishing village, a young girl named Guo Xiulan presented Huaxiliefu, a Soviet sailor who had saved her father's life at sea, with a small embroidered pouch she had made overnight. Filled with boundless gratitude, the girl told Huaxiliefu, “I’m giving you this little pouch to hold your pocket watch. The watch hands are always moving, just like my heart, which is always thinking of the Soviet army!” The girl's warmth moved the Soviet sailor, and he pulled a cherished memento from his pocket—a beautiful handkerchief sent to him from Ukraine by his fiancée—and gave it to Guo Xiulan. At a gathering attended by thousands, a young man named Yang Chun presented a recently taken color photograph of himself to a Soviet soldier, Vadiayev, with whom he had been dancing. He asked the Soviet soldier to tell everyone he knew back home that the young man in the photo came from a family that had not had access to education for three generations, but after the Soviet army liberated Lushun-Dalian, he had the opportunity to attend university.

At one celebration, a delicately crafted small purse was secretly slipped into the hands of Lieutenant Ashekefu's wife. When she discovered that this gift had been given to her by Han Cuilan, a Chinese woman in her fifties, she embraced Han Cuilan warmly. At a celebratory reception, a Soviet soldier played a lively tune on his accordion, and Liu Zhaojun, an elderly farmer who had been temporarily hired as a cook, came to the venue wearing his white apron. Unexpectedly, he began to sing the song "Moscow-Beijing" in Russian, which he had painstakingly learned. The Soviet soldiers were so excited that they started dancing. After the event, the singing farmer accompanied the Soviet soldier all the way to the small river outside the village. Soviet soldier Mekalov couldn't help but embrace Liu Zhaojun tightly, exclaiming with emotion, "Grandpa, we will never forget your friendship."

Many friendly neighbors, on the eve of this parting, gathered together like family to talk about their friendship. Since the arrival of spring, the elderly farmer Jiang Chengen and his wife, Pei Yuzhi, had felt uneasy, reluctant to see their neighbors of ten years, Captain Balajin and his family, leave. In recent days, their visits had become even more frequent, but none of them wanted to bring up the subject, fearing the pain of parting. As the days passed, the elderly couple could no longer bear it, and they invited Balajin and his wife, Zha Niang, for dinner. Although they saw each other every day, they broke with convention this time and embraced each other. Pei Yuzhi said, "You must let me know when you are leaving in advance…" Before she could finish speaking, tears welled up in her eyes. Zha Niang's eyes also reddened, and she affectionately told Pei Yuzhi, "Mama, although we will be separated in the future, our hearts will always be together. When I return home, I will be sure to tell my mother that there is a Chinese mother in Lushunkou who is just as good as she is."

In this beautiful late spring season, songs of friendship in different languages resound across the beaches, parks, and picturesque hills of Lushun-Dalian. On Sundays, many citizens and Soviet friends often picnic on the beach. At the foot of Baiyu Mountain in Lushun, Chinese and Soviet young men and women dance and sing to their hearts' content. In Lushun Friendship Park, Soviet soldiers and their Chinese friends often gather in front of the "September 3rd" Victory Tower to take photos together. These days, many photo studios in Lushun are bustling with customers. At one photo studio, a pair of friends had even traveled more than forty miles to take a photo as a memento; the two people were Zhao Dayi, a Chinese farmer, and Yigelei, a Soviet soldier. In the evening, people could see many young Chinese and Soviet men and women walking hand-in-hand, happily facing the warm spring breeze, as they went together to clubs, cultural centers, and Soviet army centers to attend dances and entertainment events.

Many young Chinese and Soviet men and women left messages of friendship in commemorative albums. Maruxia, the daughter of a Soviet officer, wrote in the notebook of her friend—a female soldier of the People's Liberation Army: "I will never forget the scene of our friendly get-together tonight. It's just like a poem that says: 'Day and night we are together, like the sun and moon inseparable; representing the two hundred million people of the Soviet Union, the soldiers are tightly dependent on the six hundred million people of China.'" A student from Dalian Normal College wrote in a Soviet friend's commemorative album: "Sino-Soviet friendship is as deep and long as the Yangtze and Volga Rivers, flowing forever."

Many Chinese and Soviet women meticulously embroidered various items, presenting them to each other as souvenirs. In order to find the best samples to illustrate Sino-Soviet friendship for their embroidery, many Soviet women went to the countryside to draw patterns, and some wrote letters to Moscow or Leningrad to request patterns from Soviet artists. They embroidered patterns symbolizing Sino-Soviet friendship on handkerchiefs, curtains, and tablecloths to give to Chinese women. Zhang Suzhen, a white-haired Chinese old lady, spent more than half a month embroidering four red lotuses on two peach-colored silk pillowcases. She gave this gift to her Soviet friends who were about to return home, explaining, " 'Mandihong' (all over red) represents our full enthusiasm, and the lotuses on it represent the purity of Sino-Soviet friendship."

### 洋溢着中苏友谊的旅大春天

　　洋溢着中苏友谊的旅大春天
　　新华社记者　鲁牧农
    一九五五年的春天，是旅大人民同驻旅顺口地区苏军欢乐相处的最后的一个春天。
    现在，旅大海滨百花盛开。在平静的海洋上空，海鸥自由地飞翔；海洋的远方，游动着片片渔帆。黄昏，年轻健壮的苏联水兵忙着帮助刚刚归来的渔民拉船和抬网。在田间，苏军部队派出的肥大的战马正在帮助农民送粪和春耕。星期天和平日的傍晚，在海滨、公园和名胜的山区，到处都可看到中国人民同苏军朋友在一起欢聚。
    在离别前的日子里，几乎每天都有旅大人民同苏军朋友举行联欢。在一个偏僻渔村的联欢会上，年轻的姑娘郭秀兰把自己连夜赶制的绣花小布袋赠送给苏联水兵华西列夫，华西列夫曾经在海里救了她父亲的性命。这位姑娘怀着无限感激的心情对华西列夫说：“把这个小布袋送给你装怀表用，表针时刻在走动，表示我的心也在时刻想念着苏军！”姑娘的热情感动了这位苏联水兵，他从衣兜里掏出了他心爱的纪念品——他的未婚妻从乌克兰寄来的一块美丽的手帕，送给了郭秀兰。在一次数千人的联欢大会上，有一位名叫杨春的青年，把新近照的一张彩色像片赠送给和他一起跳舞的苏联士兵瓦佳耶夫。他让这位苏军战士回国后告诉每个熟悉的人：这张照片上的青年家里三辈子没有读过书，苏军解放旅大后，使他有机会上大学了。
    在一次联欢会上，苏军中尉阿谢柯夫的爱人手里被偷偷地塞进了一个精制的小荷包。当她发现这件礼物是五十多岁的中国妇女韩翠兰送给她的时候，她热情地拥抱了韩翠兰。在一次联欢的酒会上，一位苏军战士奏起了动听的手风琴，这时临时请来帮忙的厨师——老农民刘肇均扎着白围裙来到了会场。他出人意外地用苦心学会的俄语唱起了“莫斯科—北京”的歌曲。苏军战士们也兴奋得欢跳起来。会散以后，唱歌的老农民一直把苏军战士送到村外的小河边。苏军战士梅卡洛夫情不自禁地紧紧拥抱了刘肇均，激动地对刘肇均说：“老爹爹，你的友情我们将永怀不忘。”
    许多友谊相处的邻居，在这离别的前夕，像家人一样团聚一起话叙友情。自从入春以来，老农民姜成恩和妻子裴玉枝心里总是有些不安，他们舍不得相处十年来的苏军上尉巴拉金一家离开。在这些日子里，他们之间往来的更加频繁，但谁也不愿谈起这件事，怕引起离别的痛苦。日子一天天地过去了，老俩口再也忍不住了，他们请了巴拉金和他的妻子扎娘来晚餐。大家虽然天天都见面，但这次他们打破了惯例，互相拥抱在一起。裴玉枝说：“你们什么时候走可得早点告诉我呀……。”话没说完，她的眼泪夺眶而出。扎娘的眼圈也红了，她亲切地对裴玉枝说：“妈妈，往后我们虽然分别了，可是我们的心永远在一起，等我回国以后，一定告诉我的妈妈，在旅顺口也有像她一样好的中国妈妈。”
    在这美好的晚春季节里，不同语言的友谊歌声响彻了旅大市的海滨、公园和秀丽的山岗。在星期天，经常有许多市民和苏联朋友在海滨上野餐。在旅顺白玉山麓，中苏男女青年在那里尽情地跳舞和歌唱。在旅顺友好公园里，经常有苏联军人和他们的中国朋友在“九三”胜利塔前合影留念。这些日子，旅顺的许多照像馆真是顾客盈门。在一家照像馆里，还有一对朋友从四十多里路以外赶来照像留念，这两个人是中国农民赵大义和苏军士兵衣格莱。到了晚上，人们可以看到许多手挽着手的中苏青年男女们，愉快地迎着和暖的春风，一起到俱乐部、文化馆和苏军之家参加舞会和游艺会。
    许多中苏青年男女在纪念册上留下了友谊的赠言。一位苏联军官的女儿马露霞在她的朋友——一位解放军女战士的本子上写道：“我永远不能忘记今天晚上我们友谊相处的情景。这正像一首诗写的那样：‘白天黑夜我们都在一起，犹如太阳同月亮不能分离；代表两亿人民的苏联士兵同六亿中国人民的士兵紧紧相依’。”大连师范专科学校的一位学生在苏联朋友的一本纪念册上写道：“中苏友谊，就像长江和伏尔加河一样的深长，永世长流。”
    许多中苏妇女千针万线地绣着各种物品，互相赠送作为纪念。有不少苏联妇女为了找到最能说明中苏友谊的样本来刺绣，她们特地到野外去绘图样，有的写信到莫斯科或列宁格勒向苏联的艺术工作者要图案，她们把象征中苏友谊的图案刺绣在手帕、窗帘和桌垫上送给中国妇女。一位白发苍苍的中国老大娘张素珍花费了半个多月的时间，在两块桃红色绸子的枕面上，绣了四朵红色的莲花。她把这件礼物送给即将回国的苏军朋友，并解释说：“满地红”是表示我们满心热情，上面的莲花是表示中苏友谊的纯洁。
