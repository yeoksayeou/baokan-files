Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: According to TASS, the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union closed in Moscow on the 18th.

The conference concluded its discussion on the issue of extensively adopting scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences in production to further develop industry. A total of forty-nine people spoke during the three days of discussions.

Speaking at the meeting on the 18th were Tikhomirov, Minister of the Chemical Industry of the Soviet Union, Corresponding Academician Yemelyanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and advanced producers from various industrial enterprises. In his speech, Yemelyanov spoke about the Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy. He said that the Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy had opened up broad prospects for improving industrial production. It not only created new dynamics, but also made it possible to produce and utilize various radioactive isotopes. The widespread use of radioactive isotopes can fundamentally change many technological processes, and at the same time make it possible to create machines and instruments based on new scientific principles.

Finally, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a long speech at the meeting.

The conference unanimously adopted a letter to all male and female workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in the Soviet Union's industry, calling on them to strive to ensure that there are no backward industrial sectors or backward enterprises in the country. It called on them to launch socialist competitions more widely, and to strive to overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. It also called on all industrial workers to create new machines, products, and materials as quickly as possible, to create advanced methods for producing these products, and to apply them to the national economy. In closing, it expressed its belief that the industrial workers, closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, will gloriously complete the tasks facing them and will make due contributions to the overall cause of further consolidating the strength of their socialist motherland and improving the material well-being of the Soviet people.
