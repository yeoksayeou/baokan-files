　　Let Tractors Be Used in Rural Areas Sooner
　　By our reporter Zhang Jianhong
    Ma Fucheng, who participated in the construction of the tractor factory, is twenty-three years old this year. He was originally a poor peasant child who worked in the fields. At the age of twelve, he followed his father, carrying a small hoe to work in the fields. When he grew up, he gradually learned to use the heavy plow to cultivate the land.

    Later, he worked as a rope-making apprentice in a hemp rope shop for several years. Once, he had the opportunity to visit a state-owned farm using Soviet tractors to cultivate the land. When he saw the huge machine, which could plow a wide furrow with one movement and plow more than a foot deep, he was very envious. He thought: At home, he could only plow six or eight inches deep with a plow. Sometimes, if livestock were not available in the village, he had to pull the plow himself, which was very slow. Often, he would plow only an acre or so from sunrise to sunset. Comparing the two situations, the difference was like heaven and earth. How great it would be if farmers could use tractors!

    One evening in November 1954, he received a notice from the district labor allocation department to participate in the construction of the first tractor factory in the motherland, and he was overjoyed. Early the next morning, he went to the district to complete the formalities. The district leader said to him: "It is an honor for you to support the construction of the tractor factory, but there will be many difficulties there, so you must overcome them."

    On the third day, Ma Fucheng arrived at the tractor factory construction site and began his new job with the construction workers. Like many people who came to participate in the factory construction, Ma Fucheng encountered many difficulties at the beginning. There were not enough beds at the construction site, and sometimes he had to sleep on the cold ground. At the same time, he had never done this kind of work before. However, under the on-site guidance of experienced workers, he and his team learned humbly. On the first day of work, their team overfulfilled the daily plan. The original plan was to excavate an average of 6.8 cubic meters of earth per person, but they excavated 11.6 cubic meters. When ramming the foundation trench, he did not know how to use his strength, and his arms became swollen from overexertion, but he still insisted on ramming the trench well. His operating methods also improved in the work. It is not surprising that Ma Fucheng was able to work so selflessly. He often said: "The use of tractors in rural areas can save manpower and animal power, and can also greatly increase the yield of grain, cotton, and oil crops. This can support the country's industrialization and also make farmers' lives happier and more fulfilling. The sooner we build the tractor factory, the sooner this good time will come." When he went home for the Spring Festival, he encouraged his wife to persuade her parents to join the agricultural producers' cooperative, and explained to them that only by organizing could they use tractors and other things in the future.

    In winter construction, Ma Fucheng was rated as a first-class labor model, and his entire team also received an award. However, he was not satisfied with the achievements he had already made. Now he is learning the engineering technology of pouring three-seven rammed earth so that in future construction, he can make the underground foundation of the tractor factory more solid and firm.

### 让农村里早些用上拖拉机

　　让农村里早些用上拖拉机
　　本报记者　张健虹
    参加修建拖拉机厂的马福成，今年二十三岁。他本来是个干庄稼活的贫农子弟，十二岁就跟父亲扛着小锄头在地里干活，长大了又逐渐学会使用那笨重的犁耙来种地。
    后来他到麻绳铺里当了几年结绳徒工。一次，他得到了参观国营农场用苏联拖拉机耕地的机会。当他瞅着那巨大的机器，一动步就能耕很宽一沟地，而且能犁一尺多深时，心中非常羡慕。他想：自己在家里用犁耕地仅能犁六寸八深，有时村里调剂不到牲口，还得用人拉犁，犁得非常慢，常常是从太阳在东边犁到太阳偏西，才犁亩把地。把两种情况对比起来，真是天渊之别。到什么时候农民能使上拖拉机就好啦。
    一九五四年十一月的一天晚上，他接到区劳力调配部门调他去参加修建祖国第一个拖拉机厂的通知，心里高兴的了不得。第二天一早，他就到区上去办手续。区的领导同志对他说：“你去支援拖拉机厂建设是光荣的，但那里困难多，一定要克服。”
    第三天马福成就来到了拖拉机厂工地，和建筑工人在一起开始了新的工作。马福成和许多来参加建厂的人们一样，开始碰到的困难是很多的，工地没有足够的床铺，有时不得不睡在凉冰冰的地上。同时这种工作他从来没有干过。可是他和他的小组，在老师傅的现场指导下，虚心学习，在开工的头一天，他们的组超额完成了日计划。原定平均每人挖土六方八，结果挖了十一方六。在分次打地槽时，他不会用气力，手臂因用力过猛而肿胀起来，但他还是坚持着把地槽打好了。他的操作方法也在工作中得到了提高。马福成能够这样忘我地工作是不奇怪的。他常说：“农村里使用拖拉机能省人力畜力，还能大大提高粮食、棉花、油料的产量，这样才能支援国家工业化，也能使农民生活过得更幸福美满。我们早一天建设好拖拉机厂，这个好时节就能早些来到。”他春节回家时，又鼓励他妻子说服父母参加农业生产合作社，并向他们说明只有组织起来，以后才好使用拖拉机等道理。
    在冬季施工中，马福成被评上了一等劳动模范，他们全组也得了奖。但是他并不满足已得的成绩，现在他正学习灌三七灰土的工程技术，以便在将来施工中，把拖拉机厂的地下基础打的更加结实坚固。
