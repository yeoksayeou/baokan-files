　　Advancing on the Road of Socialism
　　Large-Scale Hydroelectric Power Survey Work Underway in Southwest China
　　The four survey brigades of the Southwest Hydroelectric Power Survey Office are conducting hydroelectric power surveys in the vast areas of Southwest China. Survey team members and engineers, braving heavy fog and rain, are traversing high mountains and ridges, actively working on rivers such as the Nanpan River, Yili River, Min River, Longxi River, and Jialing River in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. Their survey workload this year will reach 208 percent of that in 1954. This year's survey work is of great significance for supplying industrial production and lighting electricity in the Southwest region, as well as for water conservancy construction. The hydroelectric power station being surveyed and prepared for construction on the Min River alone will, after completion, cooperate with the Dujiangyan irrigation project and play a huge role in flood control, water storage, and irrigation.
　　The Southwest region is extremely rich in hydropower resources. Since liberation, in terms of hydropower development, in addition to conducting some hydropower surveys, the hydroelectric power station downstream of the Longxi River has been repaired, the Xiuwen Hydropower Station and the Shilongba New Factory have been built, and construction of the largest hydropower station in the Southwest region—the Shizitan Hydropower Station upstream of the Longxi River—has begun.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　西南地区大规模进行水力发电勘测工作
    西南水力发电勘测处的四个勘测大队正在西南广大地区进行水力发电勘测工作。勘测队员和工程师们，冒着大雾风雨，翻越高山峻岭，活跃在云南省和四川省的南盘江、以礼河、岷江、龙溪河和嘉陵江等河流上。他们今年的勘测工作量将达到一九五四年的百分之二百零八。今年的勘测工作，对于供应西南地区工业生产和照明用电以及水利建设等方面有很重要的意义。仅岷江上正在勘测准备建设的水力发电站，将来建成以后就能配合都江堰水利灌溉工程，在防洪、蓄洪、灌溉等方面发挥巨大作用。
    西南地区水力资源十分丰富。解放以后，在水力开发方面，除进行了一些水力发电的勘测工作以外，修复了龙溪河下游的水电站，建设了修文水电站和石龙坝新厂，并已开始建设西南地区最大的水电站——龙溪河上游狮子滩水电站。
