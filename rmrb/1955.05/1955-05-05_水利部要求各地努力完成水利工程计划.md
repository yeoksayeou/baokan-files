Ministry of Water Resources Requires All Regions to Strive to Complete Water Conservancy Project Plans

　　At a ministerial meeting held on April 12, the Ministry of Water Resources reviewed the implementation of the national water conservancy project plan for the first quarter and concluded that the progress of projects in various regions was unsatisfactory.

　　The spring work tasks for 1955 are substantial. The planned earthwork volume to be completed before the flood season for water conservancy capital construction projects and levee restoration projects in the three major river basins of the Yangtze, Huaihe, and Yellow River, and related provinces, amounts to over 400 million cubic meters (of which levee restoration projects account for 324.2 million cubic meters). According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of March, 302.73 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. Examining the completion of planned investments in the first quarter, it is estimated that only 63.2 percent of the first quarter's plan was completed for capital construction projects, accounting for 20.5 percent of the annual plan. This is even smaller than the 23 percent of the annual plan completed in the same period last year. The Huai River accounted for the largest proportion of the unfulfilled investment, accounting for 81 percent of the total unfulfilled investment. In terms of levee restoration projects, the progress in the Yangtze River area was faster due to better preparation. It is estimated that 270.99 million cubic meters of earthwork could be completed by the end of March, accounting for 82.7 percent of the total task for last winter and this spring. In the Huai River area, the commencement date was generally delayed by more than 20 days compared to the original plan, and the current work efficiency is mostly only about 80 percent of the plan. In addition, there was more rain and snow in February and March, and some projects were forced to suspend after commencement. Therefore, the completion rate of the project is the worst. It is estimated that by the end of March, including the work completed last winter, the cumulative amount only accounted for 20.6 percent of the total task for last winter and this spring.

　　Currently, the Yangtze River Basin and the Huai River Basin have successively entered the spring plowing season, and the flood season is not far away. How to make up for the delays in these areas and catch up with the planned requirements, while also avoiding serious conflicts with spring plowing production, is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved.

　　The meeting considered the main reasons for the failure to complete the water conservancy project plan in the first quarter: in many projects, the design could not keep up with the construction; some projects lacked sufficient preparation before commencement, and the construction organization was poor after commencement, resulting in low efficiency; some projects suffered from insufficient construction forces, or excessive spring rain. In order to reverse the current slow progress of the projects, the meeting decided to immediately dispatch inspection teams from the Ministry of Water Resources to areas with poor plan completion to work with local leading authorities to conduct inspections and study specific measures to find ways to complete the plan. After the meeting, the Ministry of Water Resources also issued a circular, requiring areas where the first quarter's project plan has been completed or completed well to continue their efforts to ensure the full or over-fulfillment of the second quarter's plan. Areas where the first quarter's project has been seriously delayed must take emergency measures, recalculate and redeploy forces, strengthen construction management, and strive to fully complete the project plan. If it is estimated that full completion is indeed difficult for some projects, they should be prioritized according to the nature of the project, and efforts should be made to ensure the completion of critical projects first. In areas where spring plowing production is busy, and where a considerable number of migrant workers must continue construction, local governments should rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to assist in solving the family production problems of migrant workers in order to stabilize the morale of migrant workers and ensure smooth construction. For projects that have not yet commenced, active preparations should be made for construction to strive for early commencement. Regardless of the project, quality inspection and control should be strengthened during the project to ensure the quality standards of the project; further attention should be paid to the lives of migrant workers, and safety and sanitation work on the construction site should be done well to ensure safe construction. Water conservancy departments at all levels should immediately transfer a large number of cadres to strengthen the construction leadership and technical guidance of the construction site, and organize strong working groups to go deep into the construction sites with more problems to effectively help with the work.

### 水利部要求各地努力完成水利工程计划

　　水利部要求各地努力完成水利工程计划
    水利部在四月十二日召开的一次部务会议上检查了第一季度全国水利工程计划执行情况，认为各地工程进度是不能令人满意的。
    一九五五年的春工任务很大，仅长江、淮河、黄河三大流域和有关省的水利基本建设工程及复堤工程，计划在汛前完成的土方量，就有四亿余公方
  （其中复堤工程占三亿二千四百二十万公方）。据不完全的统计，截至三月底，已完成土方三亿零二百七十三万方。如以第一季度完成计划投资额的情况来检查，在基本建设工程方面，预计至三月底，只完成第一季度计划的百分之六十三点二，占年计划的百分之二十点五，比去年同季完成年计划的百分之二十三还要小。未完成投资部分，以淮河所占比重为最大，占全部未完成投资部分的百分之八十一。复堤工程，在长江方面，由于准备工作做得较好，工程进度较快，预计到三月底，可完成土方二亿七千零九十九万公方，为去冬今春总任务的百分之八十二点七。淮河方面，开工日期大都较原计划拖后二十余天，现大部分工效也只达计划的百分之八十左右，加以二、三月份雨雪较多，有些工程开工后又被迫停工，因此工程完成程度最差，估计至三月底连同去冬所完成的累计只占去冬今春总任务的百分之二十点六。
    目前长江流域和淮河流域已先后进入春耕季节，而且离汛期都已不远，如何使这些地区进度后拖的工程赶上计划要求，同时又不和春耕生产发生严重的矛盾，这是迫切需要解决的问题。
    会议认为第一季度水利工程未完成计划的主要原因：不少工程是由于设计赶不上施工；有的是由于开工前缺乏充分准备，开工以后施工组织不好，效率不高；有的是因施工力量不足，或因春雨较多。为了扭转目前工程进展缓慢的现象，会议决定即由水利部派检查组分赴完成计划较差地区协同当地领导机关进行检查，并研究具体措施，设法完成计划。会后，水利部并发出通报，要求第一季度工程计划已经完成或完成较好的地区，应再接再厉，保证全面或超额完成第二季度计划。第一季度工程严重后拖的地区，必须采取紧急措施，重新计算和布置力量，加强施工管理，争取全面完成工程计划。有些工程如估计全面完成确有困难，则应按工程性质进行排队，首先大力保证完成带有关键性的工程。春耕生产正忙，同时又必须保持相当数量的民工继续施工的地区，应通过地方政府依靠互助合作组织，协助解决民工的家庭生产问题，以安定民工情绪，保证顺利施工。还没有开工的工程，应积极做好施工准备，争取早日开工。不论那项工程，在工程进行中都要加强对质量的检查和控制，以保证工程的质量标准；都要进一步关怀民工生活，作好工地安全卫生工作，保证安全施工。各级水利部门应即抽调大批干部，加强工地的施工领导和技术指导，并组织强有力的工作组，深入问题较多的工地，切实帮助工作。
