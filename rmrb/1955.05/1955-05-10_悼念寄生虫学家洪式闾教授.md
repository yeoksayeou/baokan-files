In Memory of Parasitologist Professor Hong Shilü
Zhejiang Medical College Microbiology Professor Tu Baoqi

Professor Hong Shilü was deprived of his precious life by hypertension and passed away! I mourn him with a heavy heart.

Professor Hong Shilü was from Yueqing, Zhejiang. He graduated from the former Beijing Medical College in 1917 and studied in Germany. After returning to China, he served as a professor at the former Beijing Medical College, president of the former Beijing Medical University, director of the Guangji Hospital Affairs Committee directly under the former Zhejiang Provincial Government Affairs Committee, director of the Private Tropical Disease Research Institute, parasitology professor and medical director of the former Nantong College, and director of the Parasitology Research Institute of the former Jiangsu Medical College.

After liberation, he was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress and served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, president of Zhejiang Medical College, president of Zhejiang Health Experimental Institute, and president of the East China Branch of the Central Health Research Institute.

His life's experience shows that he was a man who loved medical education and scientific research. In his position, he worked tirelessly for thirty-eight years without the slightest懈怠 (slackness, negligence). He originally studied pathology and also engaged in pathology teaching; later, he turned to parasitology. At that time, some scientists believed that studying widespread parasitic diseases was a waste of effort. However, he realized that studying parasitic diseases was the key to eliminating the most harmful endemic diseases. Therefore, he still insisted on research on parasites regardless of any difficulties.

Because he had a realistic scientific attitude and a spirit of hard work, he made outstanding contributions in parasitology. He authored ten medical science books and published forty-five major academic papers in well-known magazines at home and abroad, of which "General Pathology" and "Special Pathology" were the earliest and most complete pathology monographs in China at that time. The basic membrane staining method and the hookworm egg quantification method he invented (that is, the currently used "Hong's Hookworm Egg Measurement Method") are still used by countries around the world. In the field of helminthology, due to his repeated investigations and studies in the ginger fluke epidemic area (Xianghu, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang), he negated the erroneous view that there were many types of ginger fluke disease. In 1929, at the invitation of the Kyushu Medical Association of Japan, he attended the meeting and gave a speech on "Research on Ginger Fluke." After liberation, in 1950, he represented China's medical science community at the 6th Microbiology Conference in Czechoslovakia, where he read a paper on parasitology. The Zhejiang Health Experimental Institute he presided over implemented the research policy of combining prevention and treatment and made great contributions. Famous experts at home and abroad who came to visit praised the correctness of its research direction and its realistic scientific attitude.

His becoming a famous parasitologist in China and enjoying a certain international reputation is inseparable from his hard work, his courage to fight against various difficulties, and his perseverance and tireless learning spirit. More importantly, it is inseparable from his correct research direction and realistic scientific attitude.

Professor Hong Shilü loved the motherland. During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, he stood at his post and actively participated in the struggle against imperialism. In the process of taking over the Guangji Hospital of the China Sheng Kung Hui run by British imperialism, he tried to collect the historical facts of Mei Tenggeng, the former British director of Guangji Hospital, infringing upon China's sovereignty and oppressing the people of Hangzhou, and published them at any time to educate the masses to recognize the face of imperialism. Tang Erhe was the former president of Beijing Medical College and his teacher, but after hearing the news that Tang Erhe had betrayed the motherland and defected to the Japanese invaders, he immediately declared the severance of teacher-student relations. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out in 1937, he was motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and determined to participate in the war. He organized the teachers and students of the Medical Department of Nantong College to establish a seriously wounded hospital to rescue anti-Japanese soldiers.

Professor Hong Shilü consistently lived a life of hard work and simplicity. Especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he sometimes only ate two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, but he still saved money to help poor young people. He was humble, sincere, kind, and never tired of teaching the younger generation. He truly spared no effort in cultivating rising talents. For example, Peng Juming used to work as a worker in the Parasitology Department of Jiangsu Medical College in Beibei, Sichuan. Thanks to Professor Hong Shilü's earnest teachings, he has now become a technician at the Zhejiang Health Experimental Institute.

After liberation, as Professor Hong Shilü himself said, he heard things he had never heard before and saw things he had never seen before. Chairman Mao's opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The Chinese, who account for a quarter of the world's population, have stood up." "The era when the Chinese were considered uncivilized has passed, and we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture" deeply touched his heart. He often said: "Follow the Communist Party and listen to Chairman Mao." This sentence has become his motto. In previous political movements and social reforms, he actively responded to the calls of the Party and the government and took the lead, and his understanding has continued to improve. In August 1954, he gloriously joined the Communist Party. I remember what he said at the party admission ceremony: "I am only in my sixties now, and I can still work for the party for thirty years..." The party gave him new vitality, and he vowed to do his best to fight for communism. His joining the party encouraged the older professors and the younger students. His joining the party set an example for us, and we all congratulated him on his joining the party. We are also proud that the veteran fighters of the scientific community have joined the glorious and great Communist Party. Before his death, he was still tirelessly studying dialectical materialism and criticizing the bourgeois idealism existing in his mind, so as to better grasp Pavlov's medical thought to guide his teaching work. He often said: to live another thirty years and do his best for socialist construction, so he never interrupted his exercise during breaks. Unfortunately, while he was presiding over the Zhejiang Paragonimiasis treatment academic research symposium, hypertension took his life. This is a loss to the scientific community and also a loss to the party. All teachers, students, and staff of our school mourned and grieved in unison.

Professor Hong Shilü devoted his life's labor to medical education and scientific research. We must resolutely inherit his legacy, learn from his spirit, unite all teachers, students, and staff under the leadership of the Party to do a good job in teaching, and mourn him with practical actions.

　　悼念寄生虫学家洪式闾教授
　　浙江医学院微生物学教授　屠宝琦
    洪式闾教授被高血压症夺去了珍贵的生命，与世长辞了！我怀着沉重的心情悼念他。
    洪式闾教授是浙江乐清人。一九一七年毕业于前北京医学专门学校，曾留学德国。回国后，任前北京医学专门学校教授，前北京医科大学校长，前浙江省政务委员会直辖广济医院院务委员会主任，私立热带病研究所所长，前南通学院寄生虫学教授兼医科主任，前江苏医学院寄生虫研究所主任等职务。
    解放以后，他被选为全国人民代表大会代表，并担任浙江省人民委员会委员，浙江省卫生厅厅长，浙江医学院院长，浙江卫生实验院院长，中央卫生研究院华东分院院长等职。
    他一生的经历，说明了他是一位热爱医学教育和科学研究工作的人。他在自己的工作岗位上，三十八年如一日，孜孜不倦，未尝稍懈。他原学病理学，也从事过病理学教学工作；后又转学寄生虫学。当时，有些科学家认为研究流行很广的寄生虫病是徒费劳力。但他认识到研究寄生虫病正是解除为害最大的地方病的重要关键。因此，他仍然不顾任何困难，坚持关于寄生虫的研究工作。
    由于他具有实事求是的科学态度，刻苦钻研的精神，他在寄生虫学方面作出了卓越的贡献。他著有医学科学书籍十种，在国内外著名杂志上发表的主要学术论文有四十五种，其中“病理学总论”和“病理学各论”两书是国内最早的也是当时完整的病理学专著。他发明的基础膜染色法、钩虫卵定量法（即是现在所通用的“洪氏钩虫卵测量法”），至今仍为世界各国所采用。在虫体学方面，由于他亲自到姜片虫病流行区（浙江萧山湘湖）反复调查研究，否定了姜片虫病有许多种的错误论点。他并于一九二九年应日本九州医学会之聘，出席该会演讲“关于姜片虫的研究”。解放后，一九五○年他代表我国医学科学界出席捷克斯洛伐克第六届微生物学会议，宣读了他的一篇寄生虫学方面的论文。他所主持的浙江卫生实验院，贯彻了预防同治疗相结合的研究方针，作出了很大贡献，前来参观的国内外著名专家，无不称赞其研究方向的正确和实事求是的科学态度。
    他之成为我国著名的寄生虫学家，并享有一定的国际声誉，是同他的艰苦劳动分不开的，是同他的敢于向各种困难作斗争以及同他的坚忍不拔、孜孜不倦的学习精神分不开的，更重要的是同他的正确的研究方向、实事求是的科学态度分不开的。
    洪式闾教授热爱祖国。在第一次国内革命战争期间，他站在自己的岗位上，积极地参加了反对帝国主义的斗争。在接收英帝国主义所办的中华圣公会广济医院的过程中，他曾设法搜集前广济医院院长英人梅藤更的侵犯我国主权和压迫杭州人民的史实，随时刊印，教育群众认识帝国主义的面目。汤尔和系前北京医学专门学校校长，是他的老师，但他听到汤尔和背叛祖国投靠日寇的消息后，即声明断绝师生关系。一九三七年抗日战争爆发，他激于爱国热情，决心参加抗战，组织南通学院医科师生成立重伤医院，救护抗日将士。
    洪式闾教授一贯过着艰苦朴素的生活，特别在抗战期间，有时一天仅吃两粥一饭，但他还要省下钱来救济贫困青年。他待人谦逊诚恳，和蔼可亲，对青年一代教诲不倦，真正是培养后起不遗余力。如彭巨名过去在四川北碚江苏医学院寄生虫学科当工人，由于洪式闾教授的谆谆教诲，现在已成为浙江卫生实验院的技师。
    解放以后，如洪式闾教授自己所说的，他听到了未曾听到的话，见到了未曾见过的事。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”，深深地打动了他的心坎。他时常说：“跟共产党走，听毛主席的话。”这句话已成了他的箴言。在历次政治运动和社会改革中，他都积极响应党和政府的号召，起带头作用，他的认识因而不断提高。一九五四年八月，他光荣地参加了共产党。我记得他在入党的仪式上讲的话：“我现在还只有六十来岁，还能为党工作三十年……”党给了他以新的生命力，他誓愿竭全力为共产主义奋斗到底。他入党的时候，振奋了年老的教授，也振奋了年青的学生。他的入党给我们树立了榜样，我们都为他的入党祝贺。科学界的老战士参加光荣的伟大的共产党的战斗行列，我们也引以自豪。逝世前，他还在孜孜不倦地学习辩证唯物主义，批判思想上所存在的资产阶级唯心主义，从而更好地掌握巴甫洛夫的医学思想，来指导教学工作。他常说：要再活三十年，为社会主义建设尽一份力量，所以课间操他从不间断。不幸他正在主持浙江肺吸虫病治疗学术研究座谈会中，高血压症夺去他的生命，这是科学界的损失，也是党的损失，我校全体师生员工莫不同声悲痛和哀悼。
    洪式闾教授为医学教育和科学研究工作付出一生的劳动。我们要坚决继承他的遗志，学习他的精神，在党的领导下团结全体师生员工搞好教学，以实际行动来悼念他。
