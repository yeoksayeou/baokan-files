    Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng
　　Please Handle Hu Feng According to the Law
　　Guo Moruo
    The evidence of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes is being revealed continuously. That a counter-revolutionary element so stubbornly concealed within the revolutionary ranks for over twenty years has been exposed before causing even greater harm is, for the construction of our motherland, a stroke of good fortune amidst misfortune.

    We were too careless before, always treating Hu Feng as a friend; it can truly be said that we slept with a jackal. From now on, we must raise our vigilance even higher. To build a socialist society, our enemies are very cunning, and we must never let them "worm their way into our bellies" to carry out sabotage.

    Construction is arduous and difficult, while destruction requires no effort. The collective construction that many people have poured much effort into can be destroyed with ease by just one or two bad elements. How can we not constantly raise our vigilance in every unit and department?

    The rampant behavior of counter-revolutionary bad elements today is absolutely intolerable. Since the national liberation in 1949, many bad elements who continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities have been resolutely suppressed by the people; some bad elements expressed their willingness to repent, and after more than five years of education, many of them have been reformed. Today, when the people of the whole country are concentrating their efforts on socialist construction, it is absolutely intolerable that intellectuals like Hu Feng still openly wear the cloak of Marxism and carry out internal sabotage in an organized way.

    Today, we must suppress the incorrigible and deliberately malicious counter-revolutionaries, and the suppression must be even stricter than in the early days of liberation. With this understanding, I fully endorse the suggestions of many institutions and friends: dismiss Hu Feng from all public positions he holds and handle him as a counter-revolutionary element according to the law.

    Based on the materials revealed so far, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes are already very obvious, but there may be many more hidden materials. This should be a good opportunity for the people in the Hu Feng clique to extricate themselves from confusion; they should thoroughly expose all the information they know about Hu Feng. For the sake of the motherland, for the sake of the people, for the sake of the law!

    The painted skin of demons is easy to deceive people. Now that the painted skin has been stripped off, is anyone still so foolish as to maintain his "loyalty" to the demon from beginning to end? That is something that the national law cannot tolerate.

    Thoroughly awaken, be loyal to the people and the motherland, and do not be loyal to the demon Hu Feng!

    提高警惕，揭露胡风
　　请依法处理胡风
　　郭沫若
    胡风反革命的罪状源源不断地被揭发出来了。这样顽强地在革命阵营内潜藏了二十多年的反革命分子，在没有酿出更大的祸害之前得到揭发，对祖国的建设来说，应该是不幸中之幸。
    我们以前是太马虎了，一直把胡风当成为友人，真可以说是和豺狼一道睡觉。今后是应该更加提高警惕了。要建设社会主义社会，我们的敌人是很狡猾的，决不能让他们“钻进肚皮”来做破坏工作。
    建设是辛苦艰难的，破坏是不费气力的。多少人费了多少气力的集体建设，只要有一、二个坏分子一下就给你破坏了。我们在各个单位、部门里面，能够不经常提高警惕吗？
    反革命的坏分子，到了今天依然在猖獗，是绝对不能容忍的。从一九四九年全国人民解放以后，有许多坏分子继续进行反革命活动受到了人民的坚决镇压；有些坏分子表示愿意悔改，经过五年多的教育之后，已经有不少的人改造了过来。到了今天，全国人民正在集中力量从事社会主义建设的时候，而像胡风这样的知识分子竟还公然披着马克思主义的外衣，有组织地来进行内部破坏，这是怎么也不能容忍的。
    今天对于怙恶不悛、明知故犯的反革命分子必须加以镇压，而且镇压得必须比解放初期要更加严厉。在这样的认识上，我完全赞成好些机构和朋友们的建议：撤销胡风所担任的一切公众职务，把他作为反革命分子来依法处理。
    就今天为止所已经揭露的资料看来，胡风的反革命罪状已经十分昭著，但可能还有不少隐藏着的资料。这对胡风集团的人们说来应该是一个很好的解脱迷误的机会，他们应该把所知道的关于胡风的资料彻底揭露出来。为了祖国，为了人民，为了法纪！
    恶鬼的画皮是容易迷惑人的。今天画皮已经剥去了，难道谁还那么愚蠢，要对恶鬼自始至终保持他的“忠贞”吗？那是国法所不能容许的事。
    彻底醒悟过来，忠于人民祖国，不要忠于恶鬼胡风！
