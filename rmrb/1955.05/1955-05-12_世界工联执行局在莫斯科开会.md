Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: According to TASS, the 27th meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions opened in Moscow on the 10th. Among those present at the meeting were Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and nine Vice-Presidents of the World Federation of Trade Unions, as well as Soloviev, Vice-Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and Liu Changsheng (China), Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and others.

The agenda of the meeting included: "The role of trade unions in the common struggle of the people of all countries for peace, for crushing plans for atomic warfare, and for meeting the demands of the working people," "Organizing an international conference of working women and defending their trade union rights and urgent demands," etc.

Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda at the meeting on the 10th.

Louis Saillant pointed out that since the beginning of 1955, the international situation has clearly become tense. The danger of atomic warfare has deepened. The deterioration of the international situation has further intensified the opposition of the people of all countries to the war conspiracies of the imperialists. Saillant pointed out that further expanding the struggle for peace in Europe, Asia, and the world is the main and urgent task facing the working people of all countries.

Saillant then talked about the measures taken by the World Federation of Trade Unions in this regard. The World Federation of Trade Unions has called on the working people to organize a signature campaign for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world against the preparation of atomic warfare. At the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the working people of Europe held an international day of action on March 10 against the Paris Agreements and against the revival of German militarism.

Then, in April, a conference of representatives of the working people and trade unions of European countries was held, which was an important stage in the united struggle of the working people of Europe against the division of Germany and Europe and against the threat of war contained in this division. The meeting showed that the working masses of Europe are fully prepared to resolutely continue the struggle against the Paris Agreements.

Saillant then said that the Seventh Session of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions had pointed out that the struggle for peace and collective security, against the expansion of armaments and economic militarization, is inextricably linked with the struggle to improve the living and working conditions of the working masses and to defend trade union rights. Saillant pointed out that in the capitalist world, there are demands everywhere for wage increases and opposition to excessive exploitation. Recently, the working people in West Germany, Britain, Italy, France and other places have taken large-scale action. The working people are constantly gaining partial victories in this struggle. They are increasingly aware that the key to achieving greater victories lies in the united struggle of all working people.

Saillant said that it is necessary to expand the organizational work of exchanging delegations and establish new domestic and international trade union links in order to promote the cause of united action. Saillant suggested that the issue of united action be the focus of discussion at this meeting.

　　世界工联执行局在莫斯科开会
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界工会联合会执行局第二十七次会议十日在莫斯科开幕。出席会议的有世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬和世界工会联合会九位副主席，以及全苏工会中央理事会副主席索洛维也夫和世界工会联合会书记刘长胜（中国）等。
    会议议程上的问题有：“工会在各国人民争取和平、争取粉碎原子战争计划和争取满足劳动人民要求的共同斗争中的作用”，“组织国际劳动妇女代表会议以及保卫她们的工会权利和迫切要求”等。
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬在十日会议上就第一项议程作了报告。
    路易·赛扬指出，从一九五五年初开始，国际局势很明显地紧张起来了。原子战争的危险加深了。国际局势的恶化使各国人民更进一步加紧反对帝国主义者的战争阴谋。赛扬指出，进一步展开争取欧洲、亚洲以及全世界和平的斗争是各国劳动人民面前的主要的和迫切的任务。
    赛扬接着谈到世界工会联合会在这方面采取的措施。世界工会联合会曾经号召劳动人民为世界和平理事会反对准备原子战争的告全世界人民书组织签名运动。在世界工会联合会号召下，欧洲劳动人民在三月十日举行了反对巴黎协定和反对复活德国军国主义的国际行动日。
    接着在四月间举行了欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表会议，这次会议是欧洲劳动人民反对分裂德国和欧洲、反对这种分裂所包藏的战争威胁的联合斗争中的重要阶段。会议表明，欧洲工人群众充分准备坚决继续进行反对巴黎协定的斗争。
    赛扬接着说，世界工会联合会理事会第七次会议曾经指出，争取和平和集体安全、反对扩充军备和经济军事化的斗争是同争取改善劳动人民群众的生活和劳动条件、保卫工会权利的斗争不可分地联系着的。赛扬指出，在资本主义世界，到处都在要求提高工资和反对超额剥削。近来，西德、英国、意大利、法国等地的劳动人民已经大规模地行动起来了。劳动人民在这个斗争中不断获得部分的胜利。他们越来越明白：取得更大胜利的关键在于所有劳动人民联合起来进行斗争。
    赛扬说，必须展开互派代表团的组织工作，建立新的国内和国际的工会联系，以便促进统一行动的事业。赛扬建议把统一行动的问题当作这次会议讨论的中心问题。
