　　The New Face of Zigong Salt Fields

    Every day, just as dawn breaks, one can see trucks loaded with salt packages speeding along the highway from Ziliujing, Zigong City, Sichuan Province, towards Neijiang. In the evening, dozens of ships wait on the green Yanjiang River, ready to load salt. People cannot but thank the salt workers of the salt fields, who, through their selfless labor day and night, supply people with high-quality, inexpensive salt.
    In recent years, the salt production of the Zigong Salt Fields has been rising in a straight line. In 1954, the salt production of the salt fields greatly exceeded the highest production in history. This year, the salt workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to increase salt production by 500,000 dan throughout the year, and have overfulfilled the state plan for the first quarter. Compared with the same period in 1954, the output in the first quarter of this year increased by 32 percent, an increase of more than 480,000 dan of salt, which can supply 16 million more people for three months.
    The salt workers, like all workers, have amazing wisdom and hardworking and courageous characteristics. They built well towers and chimneys pointing high into the sky, drilled brine wells through rock layers as deep as three hundred yards, and established a network of well stoves and crisscrossing brine transport aqueducts. They are gradually changing the old and backward production methods with mechanical operation and scientific management. In the first quarter of this year, employees of the entire salt field put forward 736 rationalization proposals, most of which were to improve equipment, tools and operations. For example, the "double cage stove" successfully researched by workers Lei Deliang and Huang Ziguang can not only reduce the labor intensity of workers, but also increase salt production by more than 12 percent. Last year, the salt workers created an "automatic brine measuring device". Now, 81 automatic brine measuring devices have been put into production, saving a large amount of labor and completely avoiding the occupational diseases suffered by workers due to corrosion by hydrogen sulfide in the brine. In order to make up for the shortage of brine sources, the workers used their spare time to launch a labor competition to dig yan soil, turning the slumbering yan soil into brine. In the first quarter of this year, more than 87,000 dan were made.
    Large-scale capital construction has been carried out in the Zigong Salt Fields. Many fields that were barren not long ago have now become busy construction sites, with towering drilling rig derricks. The two new brine wells under construction can be put into production this year. The borax plant newly built in 1954 has successfully produced its first batch of products and will soon be handed over to production.
    On the basis of continuous development of production, the salt field is building a large number of employee dormitories this year. From the second half of 1954 to now, more than 6,500 square meters of projects have been completed; more than 160 employees have moved into new homes, and more employees will soon move into new homes. In the cultural palace and club of the salt field, a constant stream of employees are engaged in various cultural and recreational activities.
    The face of the Zigong Salt Fields is changing with each passing day.

　　自贡盐场的新面貌
　　艾风
    每天天刚发白，人们就能看见一辆辆满载着盐包的汽车，从四川自贡市自流井往内江的公路上奔驰。傍晚，在碧绿的盐井河上，停歇着几十艘等待着装载食盐的船只。人们不能不感谢盐场的盐工们，正是他们在日日夜夜地忘我劳动，供给了人们以物美价廉的上等食盐。
    几年来，自贡盐场的盐产量在直线上升。一九五四年盐场的产量，大大超过了历史上最高的产量。今年，盐工们热烈响应了中共自贡市委提出全年增产五十万担盐的号召，第一季度已超额完成了国家计划。和一九五四年同期比较，今年第一季度产量提高了百分之三十二，增产了四十八万多担盐，可多供给一千六百万人吃三个月。
    盐工们和所有工人一样，具有惊人的智慧和勤劳勇敢的特色。他们建造了高指苍空的井架和烟囱，凿穿了岩层深达三百多丈的卤井，建立了星罗棋布的井灶和纵横交错的输卤枧管。他们正在逐步以机械操作和科学管理来改变古老落后的生产方法。今年第一季度，全场职工提出合理化建议七百三十六件，大部分都是改进设备、工具和操作的。如工人雷德良与黄子光共同研究成功的“双过笼灶”，不仅可减轻工人劳动强度，而且可增产盐百分之十二多。去年盐工创造了“自动量卤器”，现在有八十一部自动量卤器投入生产，节省了大批劳动力，根本避免了工人因受卤水中硫化氢浸蚀而得的职业病。为了弥补卤源不足，工人们利用休息时间，展开了挖炶土的劳动竞赛，把多少年来沉睡着的含炶泥土，煎成了卤水，今年第一季度就煎成了八万七千多担。
    自贡盐场进行了大规模的基本建设，许多不久以前还是荒僻的田野，现在已经变成了热闹的工地，高耸起了钻机的井架。正在动工的两口新钻卤井今年可以投入生产。一九五四年新建的硼砂厂，已经胜利地出产了第一批产品，不久就要移交生产。
    在生产不断发展的基础上，盐场今年正在兴建大批的职工宿舍。从一九五四年下半年到现在，已经有六千五百多平方公尺工程完工；一百六十多家职工已经搬入新居，不久还将有更多的职工住进新房。在盐场的文化宫和俱乐部里，川流不息的职工们在这儿进行着各种文化娱乐活动。
    自贡盐场的面貌正在日新月异地变化着。
