Xinhua News Agency, May 16th: Farmers in the mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan Province are utilizing dry land and vacant land to expand the planting area of miscellaneous grain high-yield crops. Daoxian, Lingling, Yuanjiang, Ningyuan, and Qiyang counties have planted more than 252,000 mu of sorghum, sweet potatoes, corn, potatoes, taro, pumpkins, and other crops. Qiyang County plans to use dry land and vegetable garden gaps to plant 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes, an expansion of more than 30% compared to last year, and it is estimated that it can increase production by more than 10 million jin. Now, the early sweet potatoes in various places have all been planted. Farmers are weeding and topdressing the early sweet potatoes and are using wasteland to plant late sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops.
    Hunan Province has a mild climate and a long frost-free period, which is suitable for planting miscellaneous grain high-yield crops. The province has nearly 10 million mu of dry land and some vacant land that can be used to plant miscellaneous grain crops. In order to study methods to increase the production of miscellaneous grain high-yield crops, the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture convened agricultural labor models and production experts from seven counties, including Chaling, Pingjiang, Leiyang, Hengnan, Xinhua, Xiangyin, and Guiyang, to discuss sweet potato cultivation experiences.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 16th: Farmers in the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province are actively planting high-yield miscellaneous grain crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. Farmers in Linhai, Yuyao, Changhua, and other counties have reclaimed a lot of wasteland in preparation for planting miscellaneous grain high-yield crops. Changhua County has reclaimed more than 30,000 mu of barren mountains. Linhai County has reclaimed 11,000 mu of barren mountains and fields where farmers have independently changed from low-yield miscellaneous grains to high-yield miscellaneous grains. These fields are mostly planted with corn and sweet potatoes. Yanan Township in Taishun County has planted more than 150,000 potato plants, and the planting area has expanded by 30% compared to last year. Jinhua and Jiande prefectures, which used to produce more low-yield miscellaneous grains such as buckwheat and horse beans, will also appropriately reduce the planting area of low-yield miscellaneous grains this year and expand the planting area of corn and sweet potatoes.
    Zhejiang Province has great potential for developing high-yield miscellaneous grain crops. The average annual yield of corn in the province is only 170 jin per mu, while the high yield of Xu Naikun, a farmer in Lanxi, reached more than 670 jin; the average annual yield of sweet potatoes is 1,600 jin per mu, while the yield of Hu Chengyou, a farmer in Dinghai County, reached more than 8,000 jin.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 17th: All agricultural areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carrying out large-field sowing. Many places have planted more high-yield crops such as corn and castor beans than in previous years. In the agricultural areas of Hulunbuir League, more than 100,000 hectares of corn will be planted; in the Fourth District of Tongliao County, Jerim League, 1,300 hectares more corn will be planted than last year. Ikezhao League, the autonomous region with the lowest grain production, received tens of thousands of jin of corn seeds from farmers in Salachi County this spring and will plant more than 10,000 hectares of corn, an increase of more than one and a half times compared to last year. Farmers are currently busy with sowing.

　　湖南浙江和内蒙古农民积极种植高产作物
    新华社十六日讯　湖南省山区和丘陵区农民利用旱地和空地扩大种植杂粮高产作物的面积。道县、零陵、沅江、宁远、祁阳五个县已种下高粱、红薯、玉米、马铃薯、芋头、南瓜等二十五万二千多亩。祁阳县计划利用旱地和菜园隙地种植红薯十万亩，比去年扩大百分之三十以上，估计可增产一千多万斤。现在各地的早红薯已全部下种。农民正对早红薯进行除草追肥，并利用荒地种植晚红薯、玉米等作物。
    湖南省气候温和，无霜期长，适宜种植杂粮高产作物。全省有近千万亩旱地和一部分空地可以利用来种植杂粮作物。湖南省农业厅为了研究杂粮高产作物的增产办法，曾召集茶陵、平江、耒阳、衡南、新化、湘阴、桂阳七县的农业劳动模范和生产能手座谈红薯的栽培经验。
    新华社杭州十六日电　浙江省山区和半山区农民积极种植玉米、甘薯等高产杂粮作物。临海、余姚、昌化等县农民已开垦了不少荒地，准备种植杂粮高产作物。昌化县开垦的荒山有三万多亩。临海县开垦的荒山和农民自行把低产杂粮改种高产杂粮的田有一万一千多亩，这些田大都是种植玉米和甘薯。泰顺县雅南乡种下的马铃薯有十五万多株，播种面积比去年扩大了百分之三十。过去出产荞麦、马料豆等低产杂粮较多的金华和建德两个专区，今年也将适当缩小低产杂粮的种植面积，扩大玉米和甘薯的种植面积。
    浙江省发展高产杂粮作物有很大潜力。全省玉米的常年产量平均每亩仅一百七十斤，而兰溪农民徐乃坤的高额产量达到六百七十多斤；甘薯的常年产量平均每亩一千六百斤，而定海县农民胡成友的产量达八千斤以上。
    据新华社呼和浩特十七日电　内蒙古自治区各农业区全面进行大田播种。许多地方比往年更多地种植了玉米和蓖麻等高产作物。呼伦贝尔盟的农业区，将要种植十多万公顷的玉米；哲里木盟的通辽县四区也比去年多种玉米一千三百公顷。自治区产粮最少的伊克昭盟，今春得到萨拉齐县农民供给的几万斤玉米种籽，将要播种玉米一万多公顷，比去年增加一倍半以上。目前农民们正在忙着播种。
