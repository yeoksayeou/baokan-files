　　No Allowing Hu Feng to Continue Deceiving
　　Zhang Xianglin
    Since the nationwide criticism of the thoughts of Hu Shi and Hu Feng began, I always believed that apart from Hu Shi being a reactionary war criminal politically, Hu Feng's problem was merely a matter of thought, a theoretical problem of being anti-Marxist. I study natural sciences, and because of illness, I haven't paid enough attention to this ideological criticism. But after reading Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I couldn't suppress my shock and anger! It turned out that Hu Feng's problem had gone beyond the realm of thought. For many years, Hu Feng had been wearing the cloak of progress, engaging in anti-Party and anti-people activities! He harbored such deep hatred towards the Party and the literary workers led by the Party! He not only used vicious words such as "official," "officials," "philistine," and "maggot" to slander and curse the Party and the literary workers led by the Party, mocked the commemoration of the great revolutionary writer Lu Xun as "commemorating the dead," and ridiculed Wen Yiduo, a progressive democratic personage murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, as "opportunistic," but he also more viciously wanted to use "blunt instruments," "whips wrapped with steel wire," and throw "cluster hand grenades" to "charge" and attack the literary ranks led by the Party! It can be said that he is a thorough counter-revolutionary element.
    From Shu Wu's article, it can also be seen how the Party has cared for him and united with him over the years; even up to today, how the Party and the people unite with him and trust him, electing him as a representative to the National People's Congress and appointing him as an editorial board member of "People's Literature." However, even up to today, he continues to attack and deceive the Party and the people. Comparing his "My Self-Criticism" with Shu Wu's article, it can be proven that Hu Feng is still extremely dishonest, still trying to play tricks, and wants to deceive the people forever! But the tricks played by Hu Feng are completely wrong! The awakened Chinese people, thanks to the leadership and education of the Party and the government, have improved their political and ideological levels today. Anyone who is anti-Party and anti-people cannot hide and cannot stand! Hu Feng still wants to continue deceiving with a false mask, which is absolutely impossible!
    People like Hu Feng, who wear the cloak of Marxism, can easily deceive those of us who have not studied Marxism enough. As pointed out in the "People's Daily" editor's note: "Such pseudo-revolutionaries like Hu Feng or similar to Hu Feng are of course a minority, but they are very harmful. They can sneak into our Party, military, state organs, cultural organs, people's organizations, and enterprise organs and do many bad things." Therefore, no matter what work we do or what science we study, we must pay attention to this incident and be vigilant. We must never allow reactionary elements like Hu Feng or similar to Hu Feng to deceive us forever. At the same time, we must strengthen our political studies, earnestly carry out ideological transformation, and resolutely wage an unremitting struggle against bourgeois idealism!

　　不容许胡风继续欺骗下去
　　张湘琳
    在全国范围内对胡适、胡风的思想展开批判以来，我始终以为除胡适在政治上是一个反动的战犯以外，胡风的问题，只不过是一个思想上的问题，是一个反马克思主义的理论问题。我是学习自然科学的，因为患病，就对这次思想批判，注意得很不够。及至阅读了胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”后，使我抑制不住惊骇和愤怒！原来胡风的问题已超出了思想范围以外，多年来胡风竟披着进步的外衣，做着反党反人民的勾当！他对党和党领导的文艺工作者，竟有那样深的仇恨！他不只是用“官方”“官们”“市侩”“蛆虫”等恶毒的话来诬蔑和咒骂党和党领导的文艺工作者，讥讽纪念伟大的革命作家鲁迅是“纪念死人”，嘲骂被蒋匪特务谋杀的进步民主人士闻一多为“投机”，而且他更狠毒地要使用“闷棍”，使用“橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”，以及抛掷“集束手榴弹”等，来对党领导的文艺队伍进行“冲锋”、攻击！可说他是一个彻头彻尾的反革命分子。
    从舒芜的那篇文章内也可以看出，若干年来党是怎样的爱护他，团结他；一直到今天，党和人民又怎样的团结他，信赖他，选他为全国人民代表大会代表，让他担任“人民文学”的编辑委员。可是，他一直到今天仍然对党对人民进行攻击和欺骗。拿他那篇“我的自我批判”和舒芜的那篇文章对照一下，就可证明胡风仍然是极不老实，仍然是想玩花招，想对人民永远欺骗下去！但是胡风玩的这一套把戏是大错而特错了！觉悟了的中国人民，由于党和政府的领导和教育，今天的政治水平、思想水平都已提高，任何反党反人民的人都隐藏不了的，都是站不住脚的！胡风还想挂着假面具欺骗下去，那是万不可能的！
    像胡风这种披着马克思主义的外衣的人，对我们学习马克思主义不够的人们，是很容易受他们的欺骗的。正如“人民日报”的编者按语中所指出的：“像胡风或类似胡风的这种冒称革命的伪装分子当然是少数，但是为害却甚大，他们可以钻进我们的党内，军内，国家机关内，文化机关内，人民团体内和企业机关内，做出许多坏事来。”因此不管我们是做什么工作，学习的是什么科学，我们必须重视这一事件，提高警惕。绝不让胡风或类似胡风这样的反动分子永远欺骗下去。同时我们更要加强政治学习，认真进行思想改造，坚决和资产阶级唯心主义进行不懈的斗争！
