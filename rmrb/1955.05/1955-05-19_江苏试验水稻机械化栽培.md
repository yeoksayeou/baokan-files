Jiangsu Province will experiment with mechanized rice cultivation techniques in several state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives this year. The state-owned Lianhu Farm in Jiangsu Province will use tractors to directly sow rice on more than 500 mu of land this year, and some of the rice has already been sown. The Wangting and Yangzhou Agricultural Experiment Stations are preparing to use horse-drawn farm implements to directly sow rice in dry fields on a large scale. Some agricultural production cooperatives in the Songjiang Special District are also conducting experiments on direct sowing of rice in paddy fields. Lianhu Farm and the two agricultural experiment stations will systematically study methods of land preparation, uniform sowing, field management, and weed control in mechanized rice cultivation. The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute will conduct research and experiments on direct seeding of rice in machine-tilled paddy fields this year.

Direct sowing of rice eliminates the transplanting process. This method not only saves manpower and material resources but also achieves the effect of dense planting and increased production. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  江苏试验水稻机械化栽培
    江苏省今年要在几个国营农场和农业生产合作社试验水稻机械化栽培技术。国营江苏省练湖农场今年有五百多亩田使用拖拉机在田里直接播种水稻，有一部分水稻已经播种完毕；望亭和扬州两个农业试验站最近准备用马拉农具在大田实行旱地直播水稻。松江专区有些农业生产合作社也在进行水田直接播种水稻的试验。练湖农场和两个农业试验站都将有系统地研究有关机械化栽培水稻工作中的整地、匀播、田间管理和消灭杂草等方法。华东农业科学研究所今年开展水稻机耕水田直播的研究试验。
    水稻直接播种是不经过移植栽培的过程，这种办法不仅能节省人力物力，还可以达到密植增产的效果。　（新华社）
