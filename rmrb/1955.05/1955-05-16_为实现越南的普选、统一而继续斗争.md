    Continue the Struggle for the Realization of General Elections and Unification in Vietnam

    Haiphong, the largest port in North Vietnam, has been liberated. The entire northern region of Vietnam has now completely and permanently returned to the hands of the Vietnamese people. The military portion of the Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam—regarding the ceasefire and the regrouping and transfer of military forces, etc.—has been basically achieved. This is a glorious victory for the heroic Vietnamese people in their long struggle for national independence and peace, a major achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and a defeat for the imperialists' schemes to maintain colonial rule in Vietnam, especially the US efforts to undermine the Geneva Accords. The people of Haiphong, like the people in other newly liberated areas of North Vietnam, are jubilantly welcoming their people's army and people's government, welcoming the arrival of a new life of independence, democracy, and freedom. They are channeling their patriotic enthusiasm into a new struggle for the peaceful unification of the motherland and the restoration and development of the national economy. This adds new strength to the effort to consolidate peace in Indochina and fully implement the Geneva Accords.

    For the past ten months, the Vietnam People's Army and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently and strictly adhered to and implemented every provision of the Geneva Accords, and have united the Vietnamese people to wage a resolute struggle against the activities of the American aggressors, French colonialists, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Accords. The workers and citizens of Haiphong displayed unparalleled heroism in their struggle against forced migration and against the looting of public property. This effort by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people is the decisive factor in achieving success in this stage of implementing the Geneva Accords. At the same time, the International Commission for Vietnam has also contributed to assisting in the implementation of the Geneva Accords. In its recent report, the International Commission for Vietnam demanded that the transfer of the Haiphong area be carried out in strict accordance with the Geneva Accords. This is undoubtedly in line with the interests of peace in Vietnam.

    Every step forward in the implementation of the Geneva Accords during this period has been achieved by overcoming the obstruction and sabotage of the American aggressor group. On the one hand, the United States has rampantly interfered in the affairs of South Vietnam, establishing and strengthening its military control in South Vietnam, creating chaos, and supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to implement a police terror regime against the South Vietnamese people; on the other hand, it has tried to obstruct the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, instructing and assisting its followers in constantly causing incidents violating the ceasefire agreement when the French Union forces withdrew from various parts of North Vietnam, and scheming to delay the transfer of Haiphong. When this conspiracy failed, it carried out large-scale destruction and looting in Haiphong. Until the moment before the liberation of Haiphong, American military personnel and ships were still frantically looting residents and destroying public property in Haiphong.

    Now, a task facing the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people is to demand the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. On the one hand, continue to implement the provisions of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement concerning guaranteeing the democratic freedoms of the people, prohibiting any retaliation and discrimination, prohibiting the import of new military personnel and weapons and ammunition, and prohibiting the establishment of new military bases, thereby stabilizing the ceasefire in Vietnam. On the other hand, resolutely implement the political provisions of the Geneva Accords, that is, in accordance with the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, starting from July 20, consultations should be carried out by responsible authorities representative of both regions to prepare for and realize democratic general elections in July 1956, and complete the peaceful unification of Vietnam.

    The Geneva Accords were reached on the basis of respecting the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the three Indochinese countries. Therefore, the accurate implementation of the political provisions of the Geneva Accords is inseparable from the consolidation of peace in Indochina. Whoever attempts to undermine these political provisions and obstruct their implementation should bear the responsibility for endangering and undermining the Geneva Accords.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has expressed its consistent and faithful basic position to the Geneva Accords, to the national interests of Vietnam, and to the interests of peace in Indochina. Vice Premier Pham Van Dong pointed out in his statement at the Asian-African Conference: The struggle for unification is the sacred struggle of the entire Vietnamese people; the issue of unifying Vietnam through free general elections must be resolved. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced its willingness to contact the southern authorities on this issue. It also issued a statement on February 4, requesting the restoration of normal relations between the southern and northern regions as the first step in achieving national unification, and to prepare for a consultative conference between the northern and southern authorities in July this year.

    However, under American control, the South Vietnamese authorities have not only failed to respond to this demand, which is in line with the national aspirations of the entire Vietnamese people, but have intensified their activities in violation of the Geneva Accords. It is also making excuses in an attempt to tear up the political provisions of the agreement. The American aggressor group is plotting new conspiracies to strengthen the division of Vietnam, in order to facilitate its transformation of South Vietnam into an American military base and colony. Recently, the United States, France, and Britain held a unilateral meeting in Paris to discuss Vietnamese affairs. At this meeting, the United States and France reached a "complete agreement" to allow the United States to further control South Vietnam and interfere in Vietnamese affairs. This practice of the United States, France, and Britain runs counter to the spirit of the Geneva Accords, which recognize and guarantee respect for the independence and sovereignty of the Indochinese countries.

    US Secretary of State Dulles announced on the 12th: "The United States believes that the all-Vietnam elections stipulated by the Geneva Accords in 1956 should be held, provided that conditions exist that can guarantee complete freedom for voters." As long as one notes that the propaganda machine of the United States and its followers is spreading slanderous propaganda against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it is not difficult to see that the US Secretary of State is actually attempting to add conditions to the implementation of the political provisions of the Geneva Accords, in order to obstruct the general elections in Vietnam on unfounded pretexts. Prior to this, the United States and its followers had proposed extending the civilian relocation deadline stipulated in the Geneva Accords in order to facilitate its continued looting of North Vietnamese residents, tamper with the Geneva Accords, and then undermine the general elections in Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has also clamored that if this unreasonable demand is not met, it will refuse to hold elections. These facts expose the US's deliberate attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct Vietnam's peaceful unification through democratic general elections. It must be pointed out that the democratic general elections in Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Accords must be held, and the agreement has stipulated that the International Commission will supervise them. The United States or anyone else has no reason to impose any conditions to obstruct the elections in Vietnam.

    The battles of the past eight years and the struggle to implement the Geneva Accords for the past ten months have shown that the will of the Vietnamese people to strive for the independence and unification of their motherland is indestructible. The Vietnamese people will, on the basis of victory, continue to make persistent efforts to oppose the United States and its followers undermining the Geneva Accords and strive for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. This just struggle of the Vietnamese people will receive the firm support of the Chinese people and the countries and people of the world who are concerned about peace in Indochina.

### 为实现越南的普选、统一而继续斗争

    为实现越南的普选、统一而继续斗争
    北越最大港口海防解放了，整个越南北部地区现在已经完全并且永远地回到了越南人民自己的手里，日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定的军事部分——有关停火和军事部队的集结转移等——已经基本实现。这是英勇的越南人民长期争取民族独立、争取和平的斗争的光辉胜利，是执行日内瓦协定的一个重大成就，也是帝国主义者企图在越南保持殖民统治、特别是美国力图破坏日内瓦协定的阴谋的一个失败。海防人民，和北越其他新解放地区的人民一样，欢欣鼓舞地迎接自己的人民军队和人民政府，迎接独立、民主、自由的新生活的到来。他们正在把他们的爱国热情投入争取祖国的和平统一和恢复发展国民经济的新的斗争中去。这就为巩固印度支那和平、彻底实现日内瓦协议的努力增加了新的力量。
    十个月来，越南人民军和越南民主共和国始终一贯地严格遵守和履行日内瓦协定的每一条款，并团结越南人民向美国侵略者、法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协定的活动进行了坚决的斗争。海防市的工人和市民，在反对强迫迁移、反对劫运公共财产的斗争中，表现了无比的英雄气概。越南民主共和国和越南人民的这种努力，是使得这一阶段执行日内瓦协定取得成就的决定性的因素。同时，越南国际委员会在协助实现日内瓦协定方面也作出了贡献。越南国际委员会在最近发表的报告中，要求海防地区的移交应严格遵守日内瓦协定进行。这无疑地是符合越南和平的利益的。
    这一阶段中执行日内瓦协定的每一点进展，都是在克服了美国侵略集团的阻挠、破坏之下实现的。美国一方面横行霸道地干涉南越的事务，建立和加强在南越的军事控制，制造混乱局势，并扶植吴庭艳集团对南越人民施行警察恐怖统治；另一方面又力图阻挠停战协定的实施，指使和协助它的追随者在法兰西联邦部队撤离北越各地时不断造成违反停战协定的事件，并且阴谋策划拖延海防的移交。在这个阴谋未能得逞时，就在海防进行了大规模的破坏和劫运，直到海防解放的前一刻，美国的军事人员和舰只还在海防疯狂地劫运居民，破坏公共财产。
    现在，摆在越南人民和所有爱好和平人民面前的一个任务就是要求彻底实现日内瓦协定，一方面，继续贯彻越南停止敌对行动协定中有关保证人民的民主自由、禁止任何报复与歧视、禁止运入新的军事人员和武器弹药、禁止建立新的军事基地等条款，从而使越南的停战得到稳定；另一方面，坚决执行日内瓦协定的政治条款，即按照日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定，自七月二十日起由双方地区有代表性的负责当局进行协商，以准备和实现一九五六年七月的民主普选，完成越南的和平统一。
    日内瓦协定是在尊重印度支那三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上达成的。因此，确切地执行日内瓦协议的政治条款，是同巩固印度支那的和平不可分割的。谁要是企图破坏这些政治条款，想阻挠这些条款的实现，谁就应该担负危害和破坏日内瓦协议的责任。
    越南民主共和国方面已经表示了它的一贯忠实于日内瓦协定、忠实于越南的民族利益和印度支那和平利益的基本立场。范文同副总理在亚非会议上发表的声明中就指出：争取统一的斗争是全体越南人民神圣的斗争；关于通过自由的普选来统一越南的问题必须加以解决。越南民主共和国政府已宣布它愿意同南部当局就这个问题进行接触。它还在二月四日发表了声明，要求恢复南部和北部地区之间的正常关系，作为取得全国统一的第一步，并为北部和南部当局在今年七月举行协商会议作好准备。
    可是，在美国控制之下，南越当局到现在为止，非但没有响应这种符合整个越南人民的民族愿望的要求，反而变本加厉地进行着种种违反日内瓦协定的活动。它并且制造借口，企图撕毁协定的政治条款。美国侵略集团正在布置新的阴谋，想加强越南的分裂，以便利它把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。最近，美国同法国和英国在巴黎举行了片面讨论越南事务的会议。在这个会议上，美国和法国达成了“完全的协议”，要让美国来进一步控制南越，干涉越南事务。美、法、英三国这种作法是同承认并保证尊重印度支那国家的独立主权的日内瓦协定的精神背道而驰的。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在十二日宣布：“美国认为，日内瓦协定所规定的一九五六年的全越南选举应该举行，假如有能保证选民有完全自由的条件存在的话。”只要注意到美国及其追随者的宣传机器正在大事散布诽谤越南民主共和国的宣传，人们就不难看出，美国国务卿实际上是在企图给实现日内瓦协定政治条款加上条件，以便以莫须有的借口，来阻挠越南的普选。在此之前，美国和它的追随者曾提出要延长日内瓦协定的平民迁居期限，以便利它继续劫运北越居民，篡改日内瓦协定，进而破坏越南的普选。吴庭艳集团也曾叫嚷，如果不实现这一无理要求，它就将拒绝举行选举。这些事实，在在暴露美国处心积虑地企图破坏日内瓦协定，阻挠越南经由民主普选而达到和平统一。必须指出：日内瓦协定所规定的越南民主普选是必须举行的，协定已规定了由国际委员会进行监督。美国或其他任何人都没有任何理由提出任何条件来阻挠越南的选举。
    过去八年的战斗和十个月来贯彻日内瓦协定的斗争已经表明，越南人民争取祖国独立和统一的意志是不可屈服的。越南人民必将在胜利的基础上，继续为反对美国和它的追随者破坏日内瓦协定、争取使日内瓦协定全部实现而进行坚持不渝的努力。越南人民这个正义的斗争将得到中国人民和全世界关心印度支那和平的国家和人民的坚决支持。
