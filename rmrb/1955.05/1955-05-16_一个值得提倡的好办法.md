    A Good Method Worth Promoting
    Wang Chen
    Since the spring of this year, Guangdong Province has experienced a severe drought. At the beginning of this month, the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized 10,000 staff members from Guangzhou municipal agencies to go to the countryside to help farmers fight drought and transplant rice seedlings. Workers from many factories in Guangzhou and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou also went to the countryside to support farmers in fighting the drought. The Party committees of various districts had already formed many drought relief work teams and sent them to work in various places. Now most areas of Guangdong have had rainfall, and the drought has been relieved, but Guangdong's approach is worth promoting.
    Mobilizing agency staff and PLA soldiers to help farmers fight drought, prevent floods, rush planting, and rush harvesting, serving the people, and sharing their worries is the fine style and glorious tradition of our Party and our army. During the domestic revolutionary war and the anti-Japanese war, our agencies and troops were almost all stationed in rural areas, providing direct help to farmers anytime and anywhere. This not only closely linked the Party and the masses, and the army and the people, making the farmers know that the Party, the government, and the army cared for them and supported them in this way, thus arousing their determination and confidence to fight against natural disasters; but also enabled agency staff and military commanders and fighters to mingle with the farmers, understand the sufferings of the people, and recognize the difficulties of production, receiving practical training in their work. This approach is very beneficial in all aspects.
    Some people say that such actions were necessary and possible in the past; although they are still very necessary now, they are no longer possible. Indeed, after the national liberation, most agencies moved from the countryside to the cities, and the content and aspects of agency work are far more complex and diverse than in the past, and the opportunities for agency staff to directly help farmers in production are less than in the past. However, if we conclude from this that it is "impossible," then that would be completely wrong. This year's drought struggle in Guangdong provides a recent example. Last year, various places overcame floods that were rare in a century, creating even more rich experience.
    Now that we have cities as our base and industries to utilize, our strength in helping farmers is greater and our methods are more numerous than before. The Guangzhou Power Supply Bureau's line management department, with more than ninety employees, spent a day helping farmers dig a drainage ditch one meter wide, one meter deep, and seven hundred meters long; in addition, more than thirty technicians helped farmers erect power lines to the village, enabling them to use electricity to power water pumps to fight the drought. We must make good use of these conditions that did not exist in the past, so that farmers recognize the role and strength of industry, the strength of the working class, and the need to work hard to produce, support the cities, and support industry. This is very beneficial to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    There are still some places where the drought is quite severe. These areas should, based on local conditions and with reference to Guangdong's practices, mobilize all forces—including sending cadres to the countryside to help farmers fight drought and production. It is possible to overcome natural disasters, as long as we work properly, as long as we fully utilize all the forces that can be utilized.

    一个值得提倡的好办法
　　王琛
    今年春季以来，广东省的旱象很严重。中共中央华南分局在本月初曾动员驻广州市各机关工作人员一万人下乡，帮助农民抗旱插秧。广州许多工厂的职工和驻广州市的人民解放军，也分别下乡支援农民抗旱。中共各区党委早已组成许多抗旱工作队，派赴各地工作。现在广东大部地区已降雨，旱象已解除，但广东这种作法，却是值得提倡的。
    发动机关工作人员、解放军指战员帮助农民抗旱、防水、抢种、抢收，替人民办事，为人民分忧，这是我党我军的优良作风和光荣传统。在国内革命战争和抗日战争期间，我们的机关、部队几乎全部驻在农村，随时随地给农民以直接的帮助。这不仅密切了党和群众的关系、军队和人民的关系，使农民知道党、政府和军队是这样关心他们，支持他们，从而激发起他们和自然灾害作斗争的决心和信心；而且能够使机关工作人员、部队的指挥员战斗员跟农民打成一片，体会人民的疾苦，认识生产的艰难，在工作中受到实际的锻炼。这种作法，对各方面说，都是很有好处的。
    有些人说，这样作，在过去是需要的，可能的；现在虽然也很需要，但是不可能了。确实，在全国解放以后，大部分机关由农村迁往城市，机关工作的内容和方面远比过去复杂、多样，发动机关工作人员直接帮助农民生产的机会，是比过去少了一些。但是，如果因此得出“不可能”的结论，那就十分错误了。今年广东的抗旱斗争提供了最近的例子。去年各地战胜百年少有的洪水，更创造了丰富的经验。
    现在我们有城市为依托，有工业能利用，我们帮助农民的力量比以前更大，方法比以前更多了。广州电业局线路管理所九十多个职工，曾用一天时间，帮助农民挖好一条一公尺宽、一公尺深、七百公尺长的水圳；另外三十多个技工，帮助农民架设电线到村中，使他们能够使用电力发动抽水机抽水抗旱。我们必须很好地运用这些过去所没有的条件，使农民认识工业的作用和力量，认识工人阶级的力量，认识必须努力生产、支援城市、支援工业的道理。这对巩固工农联盟是有很大好处的。
    现在还有一些地方的旱象也相当严重。这些地区应该根据当地的条件，参考广东的作法，动员一切力量——包括派遣干部下乡，帮助农民抗旱生产，战胜天灾是可能的，只要我们工作得法，只要我们充分运用了一切能够运用的力量。
