Xinhua News Agency dispatch Newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries published editorials and commentaries welcoming the achievements of the Warsaw Conference.

The Polish "People's Tribune" editorial pointed out that May 14, 1955, will be written in world history. On this day, representatives of eight European countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. All signatory countries will defend every signatory country, and every signatory country will defend all signatory countries.

The editorial continued, the fact that the great Asian power, the People's Republic of China, supports the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference is of great significance.

The editorial emphasized that the countries of the peace camp do not intend to threaten anyone. We have always strived for and will continue to strive for the establishment of a European collective security system based on the participation of all European countries—regardless of their social systems. The editorial said that the new treaty strengthening the bulwark against German militarism is not an obstacle to the German people's desire for peace and national unity.

The editorial of the Czechoslovak "Red Right" pointed out that the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference are of great significance to the lives of European countries and to the current international relations as a whole. The camp of free and peace-loving countries, firmly united, has never stood so firmly in history before the instigators of adventurous and sinful wars. The editorial emphasized that if the instigators of war, disregarding all warnings, attempt to attack any of our brother countries, our camp has all the necessary weapons and means to stop them.

The Romanian "Spark" said that in the current international situation, the Warsaw Treaty is of great significance for the cause of peace and security. It creates new possibilities for the coordinated defense of peace-loving countries and for the consolidation of fraternal cooperative relations between them, thereby creating an unprecedentedly great force that is fully capable of intimidating any aggressor. This treaty powerfully demonstrates the fraternal unity and complete unanimity of the great socialist camp.

The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an editorial pointing out that the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference are in the interests of the people of all countries in the world, because they are conducive to consolidating the great cause of world peace and are beneficial to all mankind. The working people of Bulgaria welcome the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference with great satisfaction. Our people are determined to do everything possible to implement the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference and turn the treaty signed in Warsaw into a powerful weapon for defending peace and security in Europe and the Balkan Peninsula.

　　波、捷、罗、保等国报纸发表评论
　　支持八国友好合作互助条约的签订
    据新华社讯波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国报纸发表社论和评论，欢迎华沙会议的成就。
    波兰“人民论坛报”社论指出，一九五五年五月十四日将写在世界史上。这一天，欧洲八个国家的代表在友好合作互助条约上签了字。全体签字国将保卫每一个签字国、而每一个签字国也将保卫全体签字国。
    社论接着说，亚洲大国中华人民共和国支持华沙会议的决议的事实具有巨大的意义。
    社论强调说，和平阵营的国家不打算威胁任何人。我们一直努力争取而且将继续努力争取建立以欧洲各国——不论它们的社会制度如何——都参加为基础的欧洲集体安全体系。社论说，加强对付德国军国主义的壁垒的新条约，并不是德国人民争取和平和国家统一的愿望的障碍。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论指出，华沙会议的各项决议对欧洲国家的生活和目前整个国际关系都具有巨大的意义。坚决团结起来的自由和爱好和平的国家的阵营，在历史上从没有像现在那样屹立在冒险的罪恶战争的挑拨者的面前。社论强调说，如果战争挑拨者不顾一切的警告而企图对我们兄弟国家中的任何一个国家进行攻击的话，我们的阵营是具有一切必要的武器和手段来制止住他们的。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”说，在目前的国际局势中，华沙条约对于和平和安全的事业具有伟大的意义。它为爱好和平国家的配合防御、为巩固它们之间的兄弟般的合作关系创造了新的可能性，从而创造了一种史无前例的巨大力量，这种力量完全能够使任何侵略者胆寒。这个条约有力地表现了伟大的社会主义阵营的兄弟般的团结和完全一致。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”发表社论指出，华沙会议的决议符合全世界各国人民的利益，因为它有利于巩固世界和平这一伟大事业，有利于全人类。保加利亚劳动人民以十分满意的心情欢迎华沙会议的决议。我们人民决心竭尽全力实现华沙会议的决议，把在华沙签订的条约变成保卫欧洲和巴尔干半岛的和平和安全的强有力的武器。
