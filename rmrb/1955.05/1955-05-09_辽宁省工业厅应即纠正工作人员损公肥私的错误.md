To the Editor:

Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the Secretariat Section (in charge of the financial expenditures of the office) of the former Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry lent out over 3,000 yuan in employee debts. The leaders of the Department of Industry instructed the Secretariat Section to actively recover the debts, and the province even discussed and made a decision to urge collection again at the departmental meeting. However, these more than 3,000 yuan of debts were still transferred to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry, and 2,000 yuan of them have become bad debts.

Are the indebted staff members all facing financial difficulties and unable to repay? No, some of these indebted staff members bought brand-new bicycles, some bought exquisite clothing materials, and some frequented small restaurants.... During this year's salary grading in the Department of Industry, most of these staff members received retroactive wage payments, but they did not repay a single penny of the money they owed the public.

Here, we should mention Ma Yezhong, the former Deputy Section Chief of the Secretariat Section of the Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry (currently the Deputy Head of the Editorial Group of the Office of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry). He was the person in charge of the department executing the collection of debts (the Secretariat Section had no full section chief). He himself borrowed 75 yuan of public funds. When the accountant deducted the money according to the leader's instructions, he asked to have the money returned to him, saying, "I will be responsible if there is a problem." This year, he received more than 70 yuan in back pay, but still hasn't repaid a penny of his debt. Given his situation, one can imagine that the Secretariat Section of the former Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry did not earnestly carry out the work of collecting debts at that time.

This situation cannot continue. It is suggested that the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry educate these staff members and correct their erroneous attitude towards state property.

### 辽宁省工业厅应即纠正工作人员损公肥私的错误

　　辽宁省工业厅应即纠正工作人员损公肥私的错误编辑同志：
    原辽西省工业厅在“三反”运动前经秘书科（掌握机关财务开支）借出的职工欠款达三千多元。工业厅领导方面曾指示秘书科积极催收，并省前又在厅务会议上讨论再次作出催收决定。但是，这三千多元的欠款仍然移交到辽宁省工业厅来了，其中两千元已成了呆账。
    是不是欠款的工作人员都是生活困难、无力偿还呢？不是，这些欠款的工作人员有的买了崭新的自行车，有的买了精致的衣料，有的经常上小馆……。在今年工业厅进行评级定薪时，这些工作人员大部都追补了工薪，但他们欠公家的款项却没有归还一文。
    这里应该提出原辽西省工业厅秘书科副科长马野中（现任辽宁省工业厅办公室编辑组副组长）。他是执行催收欠款部门的负责人（秘书科没有正科长），自己借了七十五元公款，当会计根据领导指示扣款时，他却让把钱退给他，说是“出了问题由我负责”。今年他补领了七十多元工资，欠债仍然是一钱不还。他的情况这样，可以想见，原辽西省工业厅秘书科当时对催收欠款的工作是没有认真执行的。
    这种情况不能继续下去了，建议辽宁省工业厅教育这些工作人员，纠正他们对待国家财产的错误态度。　　　　　　　东杏
