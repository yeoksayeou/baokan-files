　　Retired Soldiers on a Salary System Should Not Enjoy Substitute Farming Benefits
To the Editor:
　　I am a soldier who was transferred back to my hometown in 1955. This spring, I participated in the government-organized "Civil Affairs Work Inspection Team" to inspect the rectification of substitute farming in my county. During the inspection, it was discovered that some retired soldiers had been receiving salaries since 1952, while their families were still enjoying the preferential treatment of substitute farming. I believe this is very inappropriate. Because substitute farming is a measure taken by the state and the people to help the families of martyrs and soldiers solve their production and living difficulties. If the families of retired soldiers who have already been converted to a salary system still enjoy the preferential treatment of substitute farming, it will not only increase the burden on the masses but also prevent the truly difficult families of martyrs and soldiers from receiving more care. Therefore, it is hoped that revolutionary soldiers who have already been transferred will take the initiative to notify their governments of origin to stop substitute farming; at the same time, all relevant departments should also notify the governments of origin of the treatment of transferred cadres at any time, so as to avoid creating chaos in the work of substitute farming.

### 实行薪金制的转业军人不该享受代耕待遇

　  实行薪金制的转业军人不该享受代耕待遇编辑同志：
    我是一九五五年才转业回乡的军人。春天，我参加了政府组织的“民政工作检查组”，去检查我县整顿代耕的工作。在检查中发现有些转业军人从一九五二年起就已改为薪金制待遇，而他的家庭到现在还在享受代耕的优待。我认为这是很不妥当的。因为代耕是国家和人民为了帮助烈、军属解决生产和生活上的困难而采取的一种措施。如果已经改为薪金制待遇的转业军人家庭仍然享受代耕的优待，不但增加了群众的负担，而且会使真正困难的烈、军属不能得到更多的照顾。因此希望已经转业的革命军人主动地通知原籍政府停止代耕；同时各有关部门也应把转业干部的待遇情况随时通知原籍政府，以免造成代耕工作中的混乱现象。
