China Uses Airborne Magnetometry to Find Minerals

Airborne magnetometry for mineral exploration has been officially used for the first time in the Qilian Mountains in China.

On the morning of May 20th, a Chinese aircraft used for mineral exploration appeared over the Qilian Mountains for the first time. Three hours later, the plane landed smoothly. The airborne magnetic survey went very well that day.

The Qilian Mountains are a mineral-rich area. In order to discover underground treasures more quickly, the state has sent a geophysical prospecting airborne magnetic survey team equipped with exploration aircraft. This team will search for mineral deposits in an area of nearly 20,000 square kilometers in the Qilian Mountains this year; currently, they are prospecting for minerals in an area of 3,000 square kilometers.

　  我国用航空磁测方法找矿
    航空磁测的找矿方法已经第一次在我国祁连山区正式使用。
    五月二十日晨，我国用于探矿的一架飞机第一次在祁连山区上空出现。三小时以后，飞机平稳地降落。这天进行航空磁测的情况很好。
    祁连山一带是蕴藏量十分丰富的矿区。为了更快地发掘出地下的宝藏，国家派来了一个配备有探矿飞机的地球物理探矿航空磁测分队。这个分队今年将在祁连山区近两万平方公里的面积内寻找矿藏；目前他们正在三千平方公里的面积内探测找矿。　（本报集体通讯员甘肃日报）
