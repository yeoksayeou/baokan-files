Ten Years of People's Democratic Czechoslovakia
　　瓦·柯别茨基, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party

　　In these days of early May, the people of the whole world commemorate with uncontrollable gratitude the glorious victory of the forces of peace, democracy and progress over the mad fascism. During the Second World War, fascism attempted to conquer the whole world and plunge it into medieval slavery. Ten years ago, after heroic and selfless battles, the brave Soviet army liberated the people of many countries from the shackles of fascism.

　　The liberated people are grateful to the Soviet Union not only for liberating them from the Nazi occupation, but also, in fact, for saving the survival of their nations. The Czechoslovak people are among these liberated people. This happened on May 9, 1945, the day the whole world was celebrating victory, the day Soviet tanks, following Stalin's direct order, completed their rapid transfer from Berlin to assist the heroic uprising of the people of Prague, thereby saving the capital of Czechoslovakia—the ancient Prague—which was then on the verge of the deadly threat of the remaining elements of the crazy Nazi army. This day ended Czechoslovakia's six years of occupation.

　　The people of Czechoslovakia, like the people of other countries liberated by the Soviet Union, learned a lesson from the bloody trials they suffered during the years of hardship under occupation. They forever purged those who betrayed national independence and subjected their country to the torment of Nazi enemies for the sake of selfish class interests. Those who were so base as to cooperate with the enemy for their own benefit were punished as they deserved, while the working people of Czechoslovakia united with love and gratitude with those who were always steadfastly fighting for their better life, for the true freedom and independence of their motherland, and for a true people's regime. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people recognize the leading role of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and its line of organizing our lives. All honest Czechs and Slovaks, united in the consolidated alliance of working people in urban and rural areas, united in the National Front, enthusiastically accepted the program of the National Front government and began to lay the foundations for building socialism in the new People's Democratic state.

　　According to the program of the National Front government announced by Comrade Gottwald in Kosice, the first liberated major city in Czechoslovakia, a national and democratic revolution was realized, which transferred power to the people, to the National Committees and the government of the National Front, led by the Communist Party. The Kosice program announced a lasting and unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, and a fraternal alliance between the two equal nations of Czechs and Slovaks. In the process of implementing this program, the economic power of German and Hungarian capitalists and landlords was eliminated, and the economic power of the Czech and Slovak bourgeoisie was destroyed through the nationalization of banks, mines and large industries, and through the implementation of large-scale land reform.

　　Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people carried out the enormous task of restoring the national economy destroyed by war and occupation. The first two-year plan (1947-1948) for the restoration and construction of the republic, proposed by the government headed by Gottwald, pointed out the path towards this goal.

　　In the process of implementing the two-year plan, our people resolutely crushed the desperate attempts of domestic and foreign reactionaries to push the country backwards. In the memorable February of 1948, the Czechoslovak working class, under the firm and resolute leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, dealt a decisive blow to the bourgeoisie and completely resolved the issue of state power. As a result of the victory of the February events, the path to further advancing towards socialism and consolidating the alliance with the Soviet Union was completely paved. After the February victory over the bourgeoisie, further nationalization was implemented, essentially eliminating private capitalist ownership in industry, banking and large commerce, thoroughly implementing land reform, and on May 9, the People's Democratic Constitution was adopted, consolidating the revolutionary achievements already obtained.

　　All this enabled the Czechoslovak people to embark on the path of building socialism in their own country. To this end, the Czechoslovak people began to propose their first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), the main purpose of which was to achieve the socialist industrialization of the country and transform agriculture according to socialist principles. This meant fundamentally changing the current structure and proportions of Czechoslovak industry by developing heavy industry first, especially the machine-building industry. Therefore, it created the necessary preconditions for the rapid upsurge of the entire national economy, for the socialist transformation of agriculture, for enhancing the strength and defense capabilities of the country, for its technical and economic independence from capitalist countries, and for strengthening economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. An important component of the Five-Year Plan was the industrialization of Slovakia, which served as the basis for further consolidating the fraternal alliance of the Czech and Slovak nations. The purpose of all these tasks was to ensure the improvement of the living standards of the working people of all strata, and thereby further consolidate the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Thanks to the selfless labor of the Czechoslovak people and the constant friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the enormous tasks of the first Five-Year Plan have been basically completed. Industrial production more than doubled during the Five-Year Plan period, and in 1954 it reached 227.7 percent of pre-war production. The structure of Czechoslovak industry has undergone fundamental changes, with a significant increase in heavy industry, especially heavy machinery manufacturing. The production of machinery manufacturing has increased more than two and a half times, and machinery manufacturing has become the main sector in the entire Czechoslovak industry. In terms of the output of the most important products, calculated per capita, Czechoslovakia has surpassed many European capitalist countries, and it is now able to supply all sectors of the national economy with the latest necessary equipment. This is also fully reflected in the structure of Czechoslovakia's exports, in which the products of the machinery manufacturing industry account for 40 percent of exports, compared to only 6.4 percent before the war. Electricity production has increased two-fold compared to the pre-war period. The mining of coal and minerals has increased significantly, while widely adopting the Soviet experience in mechanized mining and the results of large-scale geological exploration. Oil production has increased nearly six-fold compared to pre-war levels. The production of the metallurgical industry is also increasing, for example, steel production has reached 185.6 percent of pre-war levels. The socialist industrialization of Slovakia has achieved particularly great successes, with its industrial production increasing 3.5 times compared to the period of pre-war capitalist Czechoslovakia. Slovakia has transformed itself in a short period of time from an economically backward country dominated by agriculture into a country with the latest industrial development.

　　In the process of the Five-Year Plan, capitalist components have been completely squeezed out of all sectors of the national economy except agriculture. At the same time, a big step forward has also been made on the road of socialist transformation of the Czechoslovak countryside. Nearly half of all cultivated land in the republic is cultivated by advanced forms of unified agricultural cooperatives and state farms. The material and technical supply stations for agriculture are expanding, the total number of machines in machine tractor stations is also increasing, and the network of state and district machine tractor stations is improving day by day.

　　In the process of socialist construction, an upsurge in cultural life has also begun. A new culture with socialist content and national form has emerged. Science, literature, and art have had unprecedented opportunities for prosperity. For example, to promote the progress of science and technology, the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, the Slovak Academy of Sciences,and the Czechoslovak Academyof Agricultural Sciences have been established one after another. Dozens of new institutions of higher learning have also been opened, and the number of other various schools has also increased. Amateur art activities have reached a large scale. Czechoslovak literature, music, and the plastic arts have all developed. Czechoslovak films have also won many major achievements internationally.

　　All these achievements prove that the main purpose of the policies of the People's Democratic system is the happiness of the working people. Therefore, these achievements are also manifested in the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people. The smooth development of the national economy enabled the implementation of currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system for food and consumer goods in the year the Five-Year Plan was completed. Since that time, retail prices have been reduced four times, the last time being on April 1 this year.

　　People's Democratic Czechoslovakia has taken a big step forward in the ten years since its founding. It has now become a highly developed industrial country, an important component of the great camp of peace and socialism. The alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries has opened up the greatest possible opportunities for the Czechoslovak Republic to further use its labor and culture. In addition to the traditional close ties with the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak people are jubilantly welcoming the establishment of ties with the great People's Republic of China and its noble and heroic people. This connection has achieved great success in a short period of time. No Czech or Slovak does not know the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for freedom, does not know the great figure and leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

　　The Czechoslovak people are very enthusiastically following the resolute efforts of the Chinese people to seek a peaceful solution to all Asian issues. The Czechoslovak people know from their own experience what the malicious attempts of warmongering imperialists to interfere in the internal affairs of peace-loving countries mean. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people fully understand and support the views of the People's China on the Taiwan issue. People's Democratic Czechoslovakia in Central Europe, like People's China along the Pacific coast, is firmly defending peace and consolidating the unbreakable fortress of the great progressive camp led and united by the socialist country - the Soviet Union.

    人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的十年
　　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员　瓦·柯别茨基
    在五月初的这些日子里，全世界的人民都以不可抑制的感激心情来纪念和平、民主和进步的力量战胜疯狂的法西斯主义的光荣胜利。在第二次世界大战期间，法西斯主义曾企图征服全世界，并使其陷入中世纪的奴役中。十年以前，勇敢的苏军在英勇和奋不顾身的战斗以后，把许许多多国家的人民从法西斯的枷锁下解放出来。
    被解放的人民不仅为自己从纳粹占领下解放出来而感激苏联，而且实际上也是为拯救了自己民族的生存而感激苏联，捷克斯洛伐克人民也是这些被解放的人民之一。这是一九四五年五月九日的事情，这一天，全世界在庆祝胜利，这一天苏联坦克按照斯大林的直接的命令完成了从柏林的神速的转移，前来援助布拉格人民的英勇起义，从而挽救了捷克斯洛伐克的首都——古老的布拉格，当时布拉格频临着疯狂的纳粹军队残余分子的致命的威胁。这一天结束了捷克斯洛伐克六年被占领的地位。
    捷克斯洛伐克各族人民，和其他被苏联解放的各国人民一样，从他们在被占领的苦难年代所遭受的流血考验中吸取了教训。他们永远清除了那些出卖民族独立和由于为着自私自利的阶级利益而使自己国家受纳粹敌人折磨的人。那些为了自己的利益而卑贱到同敌人合作的人被处以应得之惩罚，而捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民则以热爱和感激的心情和那些永远坚定不移地为自己的美好生活、为祖国的真正自由和独立、为真正的人民政权而斗争的人联合起来。因此捷克斯洛伐克人民承认捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导作用和它组织我们生活的路线。团结在巩固的城乡劳动人民联盟中、团结在民族阵线中的一切正直的捷克人和斯洛伐克人，都兴奋地接受民族阵线政府的纲领，并且在新的人民民主国家中开始奠定建设社会主义的基础。
    根据哥特瓦尔德同志在捷克斯洛伐克第一个解放的大城市科息斯宣布的民族阵线政府的纲领，实现了民族和民主革命，这一革命把政权转到人民手中，转到以共产党为首的民族委员会和民族阵线的政府手中。科息斯纲领宣布了同苏联的持久的和牢不可破的友谊，宣布了两个平等民族捷克人和斯洛伐克人的兄弟联盟。在实现这一纲领的过程中，肃清了德、匈资本家和地主的经济势力，并且由于银行、矿山和大工业的国有化，由于实行了大规模的土地改革，捷克和斯洛伐克资产阶级的经济势力被摧毁了。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下，进行了恢复被战争和占领所破坏的国民经济的巨大工作。由以哥特瓦尔德为首的政府提出的第一个恢复和建设共和国的两年计划（一九四七—一九四八年），指出了走向这一目标的道路。
    在执行两年计划的过程中，我国人民曾经坚决地粉碎了竭力使国家倒退的内外反动派的绝望的企图。在值得纪念的一九四八年二月，捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的坚决果敢的领导下，给了资产阶级以决定性的打击，彻底地解决了政权问题。由于二月事件胜利的结果，完全铺平了进一步走向社会主义和巩固同苏联的联盟的道路。在战胜资产阶级的二月胜利以后，实行了进一步国有化，实质上是消灭了工业、银行和大商业中的私人资本主义所有制，彻底实行了土地改革，并且在五月九日通过了巩固已得的革命成果的人民民主宪法。
    这一切使捷克斯洛伐克人民能够走上在自己国家中建设社会主义阶段的道路。为此，捷克斯洛伐克人民开始提出自己的第一个五年计划（一九四九——一九五三年），这个计划的主要目的是实现国家的社会主义工业化和按照社会主义原则改造农业。这就意味着以首先发展重工业，特别是机器制造业的办法，对捷克斯洛伐克工业现在的结构和比例，进行根本的改变。因此，就为全部国民经济的急剧高涨，为农业的社会主义改造，为增强国家的力量和防御能力，为它的技术和经济不依附于资本主义国家，为加强同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作，创造了必要的先决条件。五年计划的一个重要的组成部分，是作为进一步巩固捷克和斯洛伐克两个民族的兄弟般联盟的基础的斯洛伐克的工业化。所有这些任务的目的都是为了保证提高各阶层劳动人民的生活水平，并从而进一步巩固工人、农民、劳动知识分子的联盟。由于捷克斯洛伐克人民的忘我劳动和苏联的经常的友好援助，第一个五年计划的巨大任务已经基本上完成了。五年计划期间工业生产增加了一倍多，而在一九五四年已达战前生产的百分之二二七点七。捷克斯洛伐克工业的结构发生了根本的变化，其中重工业，特别是重型机器制造业部分显著地增加了。机器制造业的生产增加了两倍半以上，机器制造业成了捷克斯洛伐克全部工业中的主要部门。最主要的产品的出产，以一个人来计算，捷克斯洛伐克超过了许多欧洲资本主义国家，目前它已经能够供应国民经济一切部门以最新的必要的装备了。这也充分地反映在捷克斯洛伐克的输出的结构中，其中机器制造业的产品占出口的百分之四十，而战前只占百分之六点四。电力生产较战前增大了两倍。煤炭和矿产的开采量大大地增加了，同时广泛地采用苏联采矿工作机械化的经验和大规模地质勘探的成果。石油的开采量比战前水平增加了将近六倍。冶金工业的生产也在增加，例如，钢材的产量达到战前水平的百分之一八五点六。斯洛伐克的社会主义工业化获得特别巨大的成就，它的工业生产比战前资本主义捷克斯洛伐克时期增加了三点五倍。斯洛伐克在短时期内就从一个农业占优势的经济落后国家变成一个最新的工业发展的国家。
    在五年计划的过程中，除农业以外，已经把资本主义的成分从国民经济的一切部门中完全排挤出去了。同时在捷克斯洛伐克农村的社会主义改造的道路上也向前迈进了一大步。共和国全部耕地近半数的土地都由高级形式的统一农业合作社和国营农场来耕种。农业物质——技术供应站在扩大，机器拖拉机站的机器总额也在增加，州和区的机器拖拉机站网日益改善。
    在社会主义建设的过程中，文化生活的高涨也开始了。社会主义内容和民族形式的新文化产生了。科学、文学、艺术有了空前繁荣的可能。例如，为了促使科学和技术的进步，捷克斯洛伐克科学院、斯洛伐克科学院和捷克斯洛伐克农业科学院都相继成立了。还开办了几十所新的高等学校，其他各种学校的数目也增加了。业余艺术活动达到了很大的规模。捷克斯洛伐克的文学、音乐和造型艺术都有了发展。捷克斯洛伐克的电影在国际上也获得了许多重大的成绩。
    所有这些成绩都证明了，人民民主制度的政策的主要目的，就是劳动人民的幸福。所以，这些成绩也表现在不断地提高劳动人民生活水平方面。国民经济的顺利发展，使五年计划完成的那一年能够实现币制改革和取消食品和消费品的配给制。从这个时期起，已经四次降低零售价格，最后一次是今年四月一日。
    人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克在其成立的十年期间已向前迈进了一大步。它现在已成了一个工业高度发展的国家，它是伟大的和平和社会主义阵营的一个重要组成部分。和苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他人民民主国家的同盟和友谊，在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的面前展开了进一步使用它的劳动和文化的最大可能。除了同苏联的传统的紧密的联系以外，捷克斯洛伐克人民欢欣鼓舞地欢迎同伟大的中华人民共和国及其高贵而英勇的人民建立联系。这种联系在短短的期间内已获得了很大的成就。没有任何一个捷克人和斯洛伐克人不知道中国人民争取自由的英勇斗争，不知道伟大的人物和中国人民的领袖毛泽东。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民非常热情地注视着力求和平解决一切亚洲问题的中国人民的坚毅努力。捷克斯洛伐克人民根据自己的经验知道，渴望战争的帝国主义者干涉爱好和平国家的内政的心怀恶意的企图是意味着什么，因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民是充分理解和支持人民中国对台湾问题的观点的。欧洲中部的人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克也像太平洋沿岸的人民中国一样，在坚定地保卫和平，并巩固着由社会主义的国家——苏联所领导和联合起来的伟大进步阵营的牢不可破的堡垒。
