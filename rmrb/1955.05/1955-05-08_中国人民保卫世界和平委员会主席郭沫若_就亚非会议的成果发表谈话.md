　　China Peace Committee Chairman Guo Moruo gave a statement to this newspaper's reporter on May 7th regarding the achievements of the Asian-African Conference. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　The Asian-African Conference is an international conference of great historical significance. It is the first time in history that government representatives from twenty-nine Asian and African countries, representing more than half of humanity, have gathered together to discuss issues of common concern. Therefore, the convening of this conference itself is an important victory for the Asian and African peoples.

　　Despite the different social and political systems of the participating countries, after seven days of meetings, the representatives of the countries reached agreements on many important issues and achieved significant results. The joint communique of the conference announced that the Asian and African countries demand peace, oppose war, advocate peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation, and advocate disarmament and the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons of war. In particular, the communique announced the ten principles of peaceful coexistence between nations, which are in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Premiers of China and India. That is to say, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have already received universal support at the Asian-African Conference, which cannot but have an important impact on world peace.

　　All these important agreements are almost exactly what peace-loving people all over the world have been calling for and striving for every day since the end of World War II. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world warmly hail the achievements of the Asian-African Conference.

　　One of the greatest characteristics of the Asian-African Conference lies in its strong reflection of the Asian and African peoples' desire to oppose colonialism and demand national independence. In recent years, the national awakening of the Asian and African peoples has reached an unprecedented height, and they are eager to break the shackles of colonial enslavement and strive for the prosperity and development of their respective nations. Today, not only the Asian and African peoples, but also the government representatives of the Asian and African countries are voicing their opposition to colonialism and demanding national independence, which cannot but be a prominent embodiment of the spirit of our times.

　　The Asian-African Conference also led to further understanding between Asian and African countries and laid the foundation for peace in the Asian-African region. Therefore, the achievements of the conference reflect the victory of the forces of world peace and the frustration of the American war forces. The United States has tried to undermine the Asian-African Conference by various despicable means, but the result was the opposite, and the conference achieved a unanimous agreement. During the conference, a very small number of national representatives sang discordant tunes that were incompatible with the spirit of the conference, causing a countercurrent in the conference. However, these weak discordant tunes were met with dissatisfaction from the majority of the participating countries' representatives. In contrast, it can be seen how unpopular the destructive activities of the United States were at the conference, and how loud the voices representing the will of the people were.

　　The Asian-African Conference can be said to be another example of achieving results through peaceful consultation after the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Conference was a negotiation between countries with different social and political systems on issues of common concern, and so was the Asian-African Conference. If Asian and African countries can discuss issues in this way, then why can't European and American countries do the same? We hope that some of the outstanding issues in Europe can also be resolved through peaceful consultation, as advocated by the Soviet Union.

　　The achievements of the Asian-African Conference are mainly due to the awakening of the people. The Asian and African peoples have endured the pain of centuries or even hundreds of years of colonial oppression, and they demand national independence and the right to decide their own destiny. This historical trend has been growing stronger. The convening of the Asian-African Conference and its results reflect this strong desire of the people. The era in which the Asian and African peoples silently allowed others to manipulate them will never return.

　　The growing strength of international peace forces is also one of the basic factors that contributed to the success of the Asian-African Conference. The peaceful diplomatic policies pursued by the peace-loving democratic countries have gained the increasingly widespread trust of the people of the world, and American war propaganda is losing its market day by day. The people of the world are increasingly clearly seeing that the source of war threats and international tensions does not come from anywhere else, but from the United States.

　　The achievements of the Asian-African Conference were made through the joint efforts of the vast majority of Asian and African national delegations. The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, adhered to a foreign policy of striving for world peace and international cooperation at the conference. In particular, the delegation put forward the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences at the conference, which enabled the Chinese delegation to contribute to the success of the conference.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai also proposed the convening of the next Asian-African Conference during the conference, which was unanimously approved by the conference. This is a great achievement. Obviously, some of the common problems that exist between Asian and African countries cannot be completely resolved through one conference. This conference has created a good start in this regard. In order to further promote solidarity and cooperation between Asian and African countries, it is absolutely necessary to continue to hold Asian-African conferences.

　　Of course, we should not forget that the achievements of the conference were bought at a great price. The U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents created the "Kashmir Princess" plane incident on the eve of the Asian-African Conference, killing more than ten people, including staff members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations, Chinese and foreign journalists, and Indian crew members. These martyrs sacrificed themselves for the Asian-African Conference. We express our utmost indignation at this most despicable act of barbarism by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents. The sacrifice of these martyrs makes it even clearer to the people of the world that American imperialism and its running dogs are indeed evil saboteurs of peace and instigators of war. The hideous faces of the enemies of peace have been exposed to the people of the world.

　　The Chinese people resolutely support and endorse the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and will fight to implement these resolutions. The Chinese people must strive to promote the unity and friendly cooperation of the Asian and African peoples, and further achieve the great unity of the people of the world. We are united for peace. Only the unity of the Asian and African peoples can maintain peace in the Asian-African region, and only then can we further unite with the people of the world to jointly defend world peace. I firmly believe that the power of the people is invincible; the power of peace is invincible. Victory will surely belong to the people, to peace.

### 中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若　就亚非会议的成果发表谈话

　　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若
　　就亚非会议的成果发表谈话
    本报讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若于五月七日就亚非会议的成果向本报记者发表谈话。谈话全文如下：
    亚非会议是有重大历史意义的国际会议。代表着人类一半以上的二十九个亚洲和非洲国家的政府代表聚集一堂，讨论共同有关的问题，这在历史上还是第一次。因此，这个会议的召开本身就是亚非人民的一次重要的胜利。
    尽管与会各国的社会制度和政治制度有所不同，但经过七天会议，各国代表在许多重要问题上达成了协议，取得了重大的成就。会议的联合公报宣布，亚非各国要求和平，反对战争，主张和平共处和友好合作，主张裁减军备和禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子作战武器。尤其是公报宣布了国际间和平相处的十项原则，这是同中、印两国总理所倡导的和平共处的五项原则相吻合的，也就是说，和平共处的五项原则已经在亚非会议上得到了普遍的支持，这不能不对世界和平发生重要的影响。
    所有这些重要的协议，差不多是全世界爱好和平的人民自第二次世界大战结束以来，天天都在呼吁，天天都在争取的。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民热烈欢呼亚非会议的成就。
    亚非会议的一个最大的特色就在于它强烈地反映了亚非人民反对殖民主义，要求民族独立的愿望。近年以来，亚非人民的民族觉醒达到了空前的高涨，他们迫切要求解除殖民奴役的枷锁，争取本民族的繁荣和发展。今天，不仅是亚非人民，而且是亚非各国的政府代表也喊出了反对殖民主义，要求民族独立的呼声，这不能不是我们这个时代精神的突出的体现。
    亚非会议也使亚非各国之间有了进一步的谅解，并为亚非地区的和平奠定了基础。因此，会议的成就反映了世界和平力量的胜利；反映了美国战争势力的挫折。美国曾经用种种卑劣的手段，企图破坏亚非会议，但是结果相反，会议获得了一致的协议。在会议进行中，也曾有极少数的国家代表唱过和会议精神不相吻合的异调，使会议产生过逆流，但是，这些微弱的异调遭到了与会的大多数国家代表的不满。相形之下，可以看到，美国的破坏活动在会议上是如何的不得人心，而代表着人民意愿的声音是如何的响亮。
    亚非会议，可以说是继日内瓦会议后运用和平协商而取得成就的又一个范例。日内瓦会议是由一些社会制度和政治制度不同的国家坐在一起协商共同有关的问题，亚非会议也是如此。亚非国家能够用这种方式来讨论问题，那末为什么欧美各国就不能够这样做呢？我们希望欧洲的一些悬而未决的问题也能像苏联所倡导的那样，经由和平协商的途径来求得解决。
    亚非会议取得成就，主要是由于人民的觉醒。亚非人民历尽了百年乃至数百年殖民压迫的痛苦，他们要求民族独立，要求自己决定自己的命运。这个历史的潮流已日益壮大了。亚非会议的召开及其成果就反映了人民的这种强烈的意愿。亚非人民无声无息地听人摆布的时代将一去不复返了。
    国际和平力量的日益壮大也是促成亚非会议取得成就的基本因素之一。和平民主国家所奉行的和平外交政策获得了世界人民越来越广泛的信赖，美国的战争宣传，一天天地丧失市场，全世界人民日益清楚地看到，战争威胁和国际紧张局势的根源，不是来自别的地方，而正是来自美国。
    亚非会议的成就是在绝大多数亚非国家代表团的共同努力下取得的。以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团在会议上坚持了争取世界和平、争取国际合作的外交政策，特别是在会议上提出了求同存异的方针，这就使得我国代表团对会议的成就作出了贡献。
    周恩来总理在会议中还提出了关于召开下届亚非会议的建议，这个建议得到了会议的一致赞同。这是一个很大的收获。显然，亚非国家间存在着的一些共同问题是不可能通过一个会议就获得全部解决的。这次会议已在这方面创造了一个良好的开端。为了更进一步促进亚非国家间的团结和合作，继续召开亚非会议完全是必要的。
    当然，我们不应忘记，会议的成就是以很大的代价换来的。美蒋特务在亚非会议前夕制造了“克什米尔公主号”飞机事件，杀害了我国和越南民主共和国代表团工作人员、中外记者及印度机务人员等十余人。这些烈士们是为亚非会议而牺牲了，我们对于美蒋特务的这一最卑劣的兽行表示极大的愤慨。这些烈士们的牺牲，使得全世界人民更加清楚地看到美国帝国主义及其走狗的确是邪恶的和平破坏者和战争挑拨者。和平敌人的狰狞面目在全世界人民面前暴露出来了。
    中国人民坚决拥护和支持亚非会议的决议，并将为实现这些决议而斗争。中国人民一定要努力促进亚非人民的团结和友好合作，并进而达到全世界人民的大团结。我们是为了和平而团结起来的，只有亚非人民的团结才能维护亚非地区的和平，也才能进一步和全世界人民一道，共同来保卫全世界的和平。我深信，人民的力量是不可战胜的；和平的力量是不可战胜的。胜利一定属于人民，属于和平。
