　　Several Questions on the Transformation of Rural Small Vendors
    Editor's Note: Some readers have written to inquire about the transformation of rural small vendors. The following are answers:
    Question: Are small vendors in rural areas working people or the exploiting class?
    Small vendors are the most numerous stratum among private merchants in China's rural areas. Most of them have no capital, or only a small amount of capital. Some run small shops, but most carry goods on shoulder poles, peddling from door to door, engaging in labor in the circulation of commodities, and making a living by their own labor. Therefore, they are working people, not the exploiting class. Comrade Mao Zedong, in "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," classified small merchants as the petty bourgeoisie and peddlers as the semi-proletariat. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, also mentioned: "Among the working people, in addition to workers and peasants, our country also has a considerable number of individual handicraft workers and other non-agricultural individual laborers in cities and villages, who live by labor or mainly by labor." The non-agricultural individual laborers mentioned here include small merchants and peddlers in rural areas. Comrade Liu Shaoqi also said: "The working class must unite these working people as well as they unite the peasants to build socialism together. Uniting these working people falls within the scope of the worker-peasant alliance." Precisely because small vendors in rural areas are working people, it is determined that they can, under the leadership of the working class, gradually transform themselves and move towards socialism.
    Question: What are the benefits of organizing and transforming small vendors in rural areas?
    Rural small vendors can penetrate any remote village and have the habit of enduring hardship. They undertake the tasks of purchasing, selling, and short-distance transportation in rural areas. However, they are also small private owners, and their operations also have the characteristics of being scattered, backward, conservative, and blind. They have had business contacts with capitalist industry and commerce in the past and have already or are easily influenced by the bourgeois speculative business ideas and styles. Therefore, they must be organized and transformed so that they can better serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. According to local experience, organizing rural small vendors has the following benefits: First, it is easier to incorporate their business activities into the planned orbit of supply and marketing cooperatives. This can overcome the scattered and blind nature of their past operations, and it can also correct their past arbitrary raising or lowering of prices and stabilize the rural market. Second, it can further connect the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, invigorate the primary rural market, and facilitate the broad masses. Third, it can further utilize and give play to the role of private commerce's institutions, personnel, funds, and equipment, creating favorable conditions for cooperatives to set up and increase retail outlets in the future. It also facilitates small vendors to unify the use of funds and divide labor and cooperate, changing the difficulties of "someone handles goods, no one sells goods" in the past when operating in a decentralized manner, and the difficulty of not being able to organize sources of goods in time due to lack of funds. Fourth, supply and marketing cooperatives can conduct collectivist and socialist ideological education for them through business activities and political work, and gradually transform their business ideas and styles. In short, there are many benefits to organizing. As long as rural small vendors have organization, leadership, sources of goods, and customers, they will see their future, realize their role in socialist construction, and thus have the potential to further develop their enthusiasm for management.
    Question: What are the forms of organizing small vendors?
    According to the experience of key pilot projects in various regions, the organizational forms for transforming rural small vendors are roughly as follows:
    One is distribution and management groups: Distribution means that small vendors purchase goods from supply and marketing cooperatives separately according to the plan, at the prescribed price, and receive the difference between wholesale and retail prices as distribution income. Management groups are voluntarily organized by a certain number of small stationary merchants and stall vendors under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, according to regional characteristics and market needs, to uniformly purchase goods and distribute operations. They only have external connections with supply and marketing cooperatives. These two forms have the seeds of a socialist nature.
    Another is cooperative groups or cooperative stores, joint venture stores: Cooperative groups and cooperative stores are organized by a certain number of small vendors under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, implementing unified planning, unified management, and unified accounting. This form is widely used by small merchants with certain capital and technology. When organizing, it is not necessary to emphasize specialized industries, as long as the industries are roughly similar. This not only conforms to farmers' purchasing habits, but also, to some extent, regulates the imbalance of peak and off-season operations in various organized industries. Joint venture stores are where supply and marketing cooperatives contribute a certain amount of funds and send leading cadres to participate in private stores for joint management. The above two forms have a certain degree of change in ownership because of the accumulation of public accumulation funds or the funds of supply and marketing cooperatives, and belong to a semi-socialist nature. With the continued increase and expansion of socialist factors, they will gradually change into socialist supply and marketing cooperative commerce.
    There is also a form of agency purchase and sales: This is where supply and marketing cooperatives entrust small vendors to purchase and sell designated commodities. Small vendors pay a certain deposit to the cooperative and earn agency purchase and sales fees or price differences. Small vendors who have little or no capital but have management skills or have difficulties in self-employed businesses can generally establish agency purchase and sales links with supply and marketing cooperatives according to local market needs. If this kind of agency purchase and sales does not operate its own business, its nature is socialist. The only difference between them and the cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives is the different forms of wage payment. As long as they are supervised and managed well, they are actually equivalent to the branches and staff of supply and marketing cooperatives. This is a form that will exist for a long time to come.
    Following the above methods to organize small vendors around supply and marketing cooperatives is beneficial to both small vendors and the broad masses of farmers, and will inevitably be warmly welcomed by them. Some rural cadres, especially rural cooperative cadres, do not see the great significance of transforming small vendors, and do not actively lead them to organize them, or even squeeze them out. This practice is wrong and should be corrected.

### 关于改造农村小商贩的几个问题

　　关于改造农村小商贩的几个问题
    编者按：有些读者来信询问农村小商贩的改造问题，现在分别答复如下：
    问：农村中的小商贩是劳动人民，还是剥削阶级？
    小商贩，是我国农村私商中人数最多的一个阶层。他们这些人，一般的没有资本，或者仅有少量的资本；有的开设一个小店铺，大部分人肩挑货担，沿门叫卖，进行商品流转中的劳动，是依靠自己的劳动为生的。因此，他们是劳动人民、不是剥削阶级。毛泽东同志在“中国社会各阶级的分析”中，把小商人划为小资产阶级，把小贩划为半无产阶级。刘少奇同志在关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告里也提到：“在劳动人民中，除工人农民外，我国还有为数不少的城市和乡村的个体手工业者和其他非农业的个体劳动者，他们是依靠劳动过活的，或者是主要地依靠劳动过活的。”这里所说的非农业的个体劳动者，是包括着农村中的小商小贩在内的。刘少奇同志还说：“工人阶级必须如同团结农民一样，很好地团结这些劳动人民共同建设社会主义。团结这些劳动人民，是属于工农联盟的范畴之内的。”正因为农村中的小商贩是劳动人民，这就决定了他们可以在工人阶级领导下，逐步改造自己走向社会主义。
    问：把农村中的小商贩组织起来加以改造有哪些好处？
    农村小商贩，能够深入到任何偏僻乡村，具有吃苦耐劳的习惯，他们在农村中担负着收购、推销和短距离的运输任务。但是，他们又是小私有者，在经营上也具有分散性、落后性、保守性和盲目性等特点。他们过去同资本主义工商业发生过业务联系，已经或容易接受资产阶级投机取巧的经营思想和经营作风的影响，因此，必须把他们组织起来加以改造，让他们更好地为城乡物资交流服务。根据各地的经验，把农村小商贩组织起来以后，有下面几个好处：第一、便于把他们的业务活动纳入供销合作社的计划轨道，这样，既可以克服他们过去经营中的分散性和盲目性，也可以纠正他们过去随便抬高或压低物价，稳定农村市场：第二、可以进一步沟通城乡的物资交流，活跃农村的初级市场，便利广大群众；第三、可以进一步利用和发挥私营商业的机构、人员、资金和设备的作用，给合作社在今后设置和增加零售网方面创造有利条件；同时也便于小商贩统一运用资金和分工协作，改变过去分散经营时“有人办货，无人卖货”，以及因缺少资金而不能及时组织货源的困难；第四、供销合作社可以通过业务活动和政治工作，对他们进行集体主义、社会主义的思想教育，逐步改造他们的经营思想和经营作风。总之，组织起来的好处是很多的。农村中的小商贩只要有了组织、有了领导、有了货源、有了主顾，他们就会看到自己的前途，就会认识到本身在社会主义建设中的作用，因而也就有可能进一步发挥经营的积极性。
    问：组织小商贩，有哪几种形式？
    根据各地重点试办的经验，对农村小商贩改造的组织形式，大体有以下几种：
    一种是经销、经营小组：经销是小商贩以户为单位分别地按计划从供销合作社进货，按规定价格出售，得到批发同零售的差价作为经销的收入。经营小组是由一定户数的小型座商、摊贩，在供销合作社领导下，根据地区特点和市场需要，自愿组织起来，统一进货，分散经营，他们同供销合作社只有外部联系。这两种形式带有社会主义性质的萌芽。
    另一种是合作小组或合作商店、合营商店：合作小组和合作商店，是一定户数的小商贩在供销合作社领导下组织起来，实行统一计划、统一经营、统一核算。这种形式是具有一定资金、一定技术的小商人所普遍采用的。组织时可根据情况不必强调专行专业，只要大体相近的行业即可组织起来。这不仅符合农民购买习惯，而且在某种程度上还调节了已组织起来的各行业淡、旺季经营的不平衡性。合营商店，是由供销合作社出一定数量的资金，派遣领导干部参加私营商店，进行合营。以上两种形式因有公积金积累或有了供销合作社资金，所有制已有一定程度的改变，是属于半社会主义性质的。随着社会主义因素的继续增加和扩大，会逐渐改变为社会主义的供销合作社商业。
    还有一种代购、代销的形式：这是供销合作社委托小商贩代购、代销指定的商品。小商贩向合作社缴纳一定的保证金，赚取代购、代销手续费或差价。凡资金少或没有资金而有经营技术或自营业务困难的小商小贩，根据当地市场需要，一般都可同供销合作社建立代购、代销联系。这种代购、代销如果不经营自营业务，其性质就是社会主义性质。他们同供销合作社的干部不一样的，只是工资支付形式的不同。只要对他们监督和管理得好，他们实际上就等于供销合作社的分支机构和工作人员了。这是今后较长时期会存在的一种形式。
    按照以上几种形式，把小商贩组织在供销合作社周围的办法，对于小商贩和广大农民都是有利的，因而必然会得到他们的热烈欢迎。有些农村干部特别是农村合作社干部看不到改造小商小贩的重大意义，而不积极去领导他们，把他们组织起来，甚至排挤他们。这种做法是不对的，当注意改正。
