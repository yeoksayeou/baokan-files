Xinjiang Yuli Wild Hemp Woven into Various Woolen Fabrics
    Wild hemp produced in Yuli County, Xinjiang, has been woven into various woolen fabrics and cloths.
    In early May, the Korla Commissioner's Office of Xinjiang received a package sent by the Shanghai Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company. Inside were samples of more than ten kinds of woolen fabrics and cloths of various colors, woven in a textile factory in Shanghai using wild hemp produced in Yuli County, Xinjiang. These included: hemp cloth, hemp voile, worsted fabric made of hemp and wool, gabardine, fancy woolen cloth, hemp silk made of hemp and silk, and various colors of woolen fabrics made of hemp, wool, and silk. The staff of the Commissioner's Office were very excited when they saw these fabrics. The Commissioner's Office decided to widely circulate these samples among the people. Wild hemp is abundant in the Kongque River area south of the Tianshan Mountains. Before liberation, farmers only used wild hemp to make pockets or twist ropes. After liberation, after investigation and research by textile experts, it was believed that wild hemp was a very good textile raw material, and wild hemp began to be used to weave various woolen fabrics and cloths.

　  新疆尉犁野麻织成各种呢布
    新疆尉犁县出产的野麻，织成了各种呢、布。
    五月初，新疆库尔勒专署收到了中国土产出口公司上海分公司寄给的一个包裹。里面装着用新疆尉犁县所产的野麻在上海一个纺织厂织成的十多种各色呢、布的样本。其中包括：麻织布、麻纱细布、麻和羊毛混织的凡立丁、华达呢、女色呢、麻和丝混织的麻绫纺以及麻、毛、丝混织的各色呢。专署的工作人员们看了这些呢、布，都很兴奋。专署决定把这些样品在人民群众中广泛传看。天山以南孔雀河一带盛产野麻。解放以前，农民们只是用野麻来编口袋或搓绳索。解放以后，经过纺织专家调查研究，认为野麻是很好的纺织原料，野麻才开始被用来织成各种呢、布。
