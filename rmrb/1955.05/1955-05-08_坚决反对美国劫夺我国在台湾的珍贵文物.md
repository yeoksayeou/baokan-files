    Resolutely Oppose the US Seizure of Our Country's Precious Cultural Relics in Taiwan
    According to a May 3rd dispatch from New York by the Associated Press, Horace Jayne, the vice director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States, suggested that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "send most of the great Chinese art treasures stored in the cellars of Taiwan to the United States on a long-term loan basis." After invading our country's territory of Taiwan, the US imperialists now intend to plunder our country's precious historical relics that were stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chinese people express extreme indignation at this act and resolutely oppose this act of theft.
    These precious cultural relics were successively stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique starting in 1948. The first and second batches alone included 3,348 boxes of precious cultural relics and books from the former Nanjing Museum, the Palace Museum, the Nanjing Library, and the Beijing Library. In addition, there were thousands of boxes of cultural relics, books, and archives from the third batch and from units such as the former Academia Sinica and the Peiping Research Institute. These are all extremely precious cultural heritages of our country. In terms of bronzes, there are the Mao Gong Ding, San Shi Pan, Shi Ling Zun, and most of the Yin Dynasty bronzes unearthed in Anyang; in terms of oracle bones, there are more than 25,000 pieces; in terms of paintings and books, there are thousands of famous paintings such as Huang Yuanlong's "Suburban People Welcoming" from the Five Dynasties, Zhao Gan's "First Snow on the River" from the Five Dynasties, Ju Ran's "Seeking the Dao in the Mountains" from the Song Dynasty, and Guo Xi's "Early Spring" from the Song Dynasty; in addition, there are hundreds of kinds of Northern Song Dynasty engraved copies of the "Records of the Grand Historian" and Song Shu engraved copies of "Zhuangzi"; Warring States lacquerware unearthed in Changsha, and various famous kiln porcelains, gold and silver wares, and jade wares from various dynasties, totaling more than 100,000 pieces. Now, the US imperialists want to plunder all of these rich treasures, which is a heinous crime.
    Everyone knows that US imperialism is not only a "master" of aggression, but also a "master" of theft. In the past century, American invaders have used extremely despicable means to plunder countless precious cultural relics from China. To name a few major ones, in terms of stone carvings and sculptures: there are the sculptures from the tomb of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the "Sa Luzi" and "Quan Mao Jiao" from the Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, eight Tang Sancai Luohan from Yixian County, Hebei (now scattered in the New York Art Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum), the bronze Maitreya statue cast by the Empress Dowager of Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty, and the most famous "Emperor and Empress Worshipping Buddha" from the Northern Wei Dynasty in Longmen (now in the New York Museum). In terms of paintings, tens of thousands have been looted, and more than 500 are of important value in the history of Chinese painting, such as the "Painted Book" (the oldest painted picture and handwritten characters in China) from the Warring States period unearthed in Changsha during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan Liben's "Portraits of Emperors of Past Dynasties" from the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty painting "Sakyamuni Buddha Assembly," Dong Yuan's "Autumn Clearing After Rain in Pinglin" from the Five Dynasties, and Gong Kai's "Zhongshan Outing" and "Zhong Kui" from the Song Dynasty. In terms of ancient buildings, there is the entire building and Buddha statues and Dharma instruments of an ancient Lama temple in Suiyuan, and the entire painted caisson and woodwork of the Ming Dynasty Zhihua Temple (now in the American Gan Cheng Museum). In addition, there are a large number of bronzes, jade wares, lacquerwares, and porcelains unearthed in Yin Ruins and Shaanxi, Shanxi, Anhui, Changsha, Henan, and other places. Among the precious cultural relics of our country stolen by the US imperialists is also the world-famous human skull dating back approximately 500,000 years—"Peking Man." The United States also stole more than 5,000 kinds of local chronicles from our country, more than 2,000 kinds of genealogies, thousands of kinds of rare books, and more than 4,000 copies of the Moso classics of our fraternal ethnic groups in Lijiang, Yunnan, and the entire golden-written Tibetan Tripitaka, unparalleled in the world, secretly hidden in a large Lama temple in Tibet, etc. The massive theft of these cultural heritages has caused significant losses to the people of our country, and now the US imperialists are conspiring to loot all of a large number of precious cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States, which is absolutely unacceptable to the people of our country. The US imperialist element Jayne even described this conspiracy to plunder as an "inescapable international obligation" of the United States. This is even more absurd and shameless to the extreme!
    Taiwan is our country's territory, and we must liberate it. The cultural relics plundered by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are our country's treasures, and we must recover them. The US imperialists must immediately stop this conspiracy, otherwise, they must bear all the consequences.

    坚决反对美国劫夺我国在台湾的珍贵文物
    据美联社纽约五月三日电讯，美国费城艺术博物馆副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼建议蒋介石卖国集团“根据长期出借的方式把存放在台湾地窖里的大部分伟大的中国艺术珍藏送到美国去。”美帝国主义者在侵占我国领土台湾之后，现在又要阴谋劫夺蒋介石卖国集团盗运到台湾的我国珍贵的历史文物。我国人民对此表示极端愤慨，并坚决反对这一盗窃行为。
    这批珍贵文物，是蒋介石卖国集团从一九四八年起陆续盗运到台湾的。其中仅一、二两批即包括前南京博物院，故宫博物院，南京图书馆，北京图书馆等珍贵文物图书三千三百四十八箱。此外还有第三批及前中央研究院，北平研究院等单位的文物图书档案数千箱。这些都是我国极为珍贵的文化遗产。以铜器来说，有毛公鼎，散氏盘，矢令尊，及安阳出土大部分殷代铜器等；以甲骨来说，多到二万五千余片；以绘画、书籍来说，有五代黄源龙宿郊民图，五代赵干江行初雪图，宋巨然溪山问道图，宋郭熙早春图等名画数千件；此外还有北宋刻本史记，宋蜀刻本庄子等数百种；长沙出土战国漆器，及历代各种名窑瓷器，金银器，玉器等，总数在十万件以上。现在美帝国主义者竟想把这批丰富的宝藏全部劫夺，这是滔天的罪行。
    谁都知道，美帝国主义不仅是侵略的“能手”，而且也是盗窃的“能手”。近百年来，美国侵略者用了极端卑鄙的手段从中国掠夺了无数的珍贵文物。举其大者，在石刻、雕塑方面：有汉武帝陵墓的雕刻，唐太宗昭陵六骏中飒露紫，拳毛?，河北易县的唐三彩罗汉八尊，（现散藏于纽约艺术馆，波斯顿美术馆，宾省大学博物馆等地）北魏孝文帝的皇太后铸造的铜弥勒立像，和龙门最著名的北魏时雕刻的大幅帝后礼佛图（现在纽约博物馆）等。在绘画方面，被劫掠的数以万计，在我国绘画史上具有重要价值的，就有五百帧以上，如抗战时期长沙出土的战国时代的“绘书”（我国最古的笔绘的画和笔写的字）唐阎立本历代帝王像，唐人画释迦牟尼佛会图，五代董源平林秋霁图，宋龚开中山出游图和钟馗图等。在古建筑物方面，有绥远一喇嘛古庙寺的全部建筑物及佛像、法器、明初智化寺全部的彩绘藻井木作（现藏美国干城博物馆中）。此外，有殷墟和陕西、山西、安徽、长沙、河南等地出土的大量青铜器、玉器、漆器、陶瓷器等。被美帝国主义者偷盗的我国宝贵文物中还有世界著名的约在五十万年前的人类头骨—“北京人”。美国还盗走了我国地方志五千种以上，家谱二千种以上，善本书数千种，及云南丽江我兄弟民族的么些经典四千余部，西藏某大喇嘛寺秘藏的世无其匹的金写藏文大藏经全部，等等。这些文化遗产的被大量盗窃，已使我国人民遭受重大的损失，而现在美帝国主义者又阴谋将在台湾的一大批珍贵文物全数洗劫去美国，这是我全国人民所绝不能允许的。美帝国主义分子杰尼竟把这种阴谋劫夺说成为美国的“不可逃避的国际义务”。这更是荒谬绝伦，无耻已极！
    台湾是我国的领土，我们一定要解放。蒋介石卖国集团所劫走的文物，是我国的宝藏，我们一定要收回。美帝国主义者必须立即停止这一阴谋，否则它必须对一切后果负起全部责任。
