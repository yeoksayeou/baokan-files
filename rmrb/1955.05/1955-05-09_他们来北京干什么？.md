To the Editorial Comrades:

The Ministry of Finance holds one or two national meetings of department and bureau chiefs every year. According to regulations, attendees, in addition to the department and bureau chiefs themselves, may bring one aide to assist with the meeting. But what is the actual situation? Most provinces and cities exceed the prescribed number. For example, at the department and bureau chiefs meeting held in March this year, Hunan Province sent seven people, and most provinces and cities brought three or four people. Many department and bureau chiefs also brought security guards. For example, Wang Wei, the Director of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Finance, flew to Beijing first and then had his security guard slowly arrive by car, train, and boat. Pang Rufang, the Section Chief of Henan Province who came to the meeting with the Director, and the security guard, having nothing to do, requisitioned a car from the government in the name of the Director to go shopping at Xidan Department Store. In addition to bringing a security guard, An Dongtai, the Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance, brought his son last year and his father this year.

Since the department and bureau chiefs bring so many people, the comrades in charge of reception are also busy, and the meeting expenses increase. Someone calculated a detailed account for the security guards who came to Beijing for the meeting with the department and bureau chiefs: the public subsidy for food and lodging for one additional person is 4.6 yuan per person per day. Based on the fact that the two meetings last year brought a total of thirty security guards, the daily expenditure was 138 yuan. It is said that these people can also receive a travel and lodging allowance after returning. This phenomenon occurs among certain leaders in charge of national financial expenditures in various places, and it cannot be considered a small matter. In order to save national funds, it is hoped that those who come to Beijing for meetings from various places will consciously abide by the meeting regulations and not bring unnecessary personnel to Beijing.

### 他们来北京干什么？

　　他们来北京干什么？编辑同志：
    财政部每年都要召开一两次全国性的厅、局长会议。按照规定：出席会议的人，除厅、局长本人外，可以带一名有助于会议的随员。但实际情况呢？大部分省、市都超过了规定人数。例如，今年三月召开的厅、局长会议，湖南省就来了七个人，一般的省、市也都带了三四个人。还有不少的厅、局长带着警卫员。像贵州省财政厅厅长王维自己坐了飞机先到北京，叫警卫员坐汽车、火车、轮船姗姗地赶来。河南省随厅长来开会的庞如舫科长和警卫员闲着无事，就以厅长名义向公家要汽车去逛西单商场。湖北省财政厅副厅长安东泰除了带来警卫员以外，去年还带了儿子，今年又带来了父亲。
    厅、局长既然带了这么些人，招待的同志也繁忙起来，会议的费用也就要增加，有人给随厅、局长来北京开会的警卫员算了一个细账：增加一个人公家对他们伙食、房租的补贴费是每人每天四元六角，以去年两次会议共带来三十名警卫员计算，每天要开支一百三十八元。据说这些人回去后还可以领到一笔路途和在外住勤的补助费。而这种现象发生在各地主管国家财政开支的某些负责人身上，不能算是一件小事情。为了节省国家的资金，希望各地来北京开会的人自觉地遵守会议规定，不要把不必要的人员带到北京来。　　　　　　　孜孜
