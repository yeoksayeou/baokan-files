　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 20th: The French government decided on the 19th to send an additional 40,000 troops to Algeria to strengthen the suppression of the local people's increasingly intense armed struggle against colonial rule. This decision brings the total number of French troops in Algeria to 100,000.

　　According to an official communique released on the 19th, the reinforcements include ten infantry battalions, one reconnaissance regiment, and eight mobile gendarmerie squadrons. Some of these troops are already en route to Algeria. The communique indicates that the government has also decided to send reinforcements and transfer troops currently stationed in West Germany to replace some of the troops currently stationed in Algeria, in order to "strengthen" the "combat effectiveness" of the French forces. In addition, the French authorities have also dispatched naval ships and marines, as well as aircraft and helicopters, to Algeria to participate in the suppression operations.

　　法国增派大批军队镇压阿尔及利亚人民
    新华社二十日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府十九日决定加派四万名军队前往阿尔及利亚，以加强镇压当地人民日益高涨的反对殖民统治的武装斗争。这一决定使法国在阿尔及利亚部队的总数增加到十万人。
    据官方十九日发表的公报说，增派的部队包括十个步兵营、一个侦察团和八个流动宪兵中队。其中一部分部队已经在前往阿尔及利亚的途中。公报表明，政府还决定派遣增援部队和调派目前驻在西德的部队去替换现驻阿尔及利亚的某些部队，以“加强”法国部队的“作战效力”。此外，法国当局还派遣海军舰只和海军陆战队以及飞机和直升飞机前往阿尔及利亚参加镇压行动。
