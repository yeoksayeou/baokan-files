To the Editor:

　　On the river embankment, I saw many revolutionary veterans and demobilized construction soldiers from our district displaying a high degree of revolutionary heroism and maintaining the honor of revolutionary soldiers in the work of closing breaches and repairing embankments. Their exemplary actions deeply educated me and all the cadres and laborers participating in the embankment repair.

　　Second-class disabled soldier Wang Xuecheng is a Communist Party member who served as an officer in the army. This time, he served as a labor supervisor. Just after the Spring Festival, he led more than 400 laborers from his township to the embankment.

　　They were responsible for repairing the Zhu Jia Yang dangerous section, which is well-known throughout the county. On February 5th, it was raining, and Wang Xuecheng led everyone to dig ditches and drain water in the rain, working from morning until evening, eating only one meal a day. The next day, the temperature dropped to minus three degrees Celsius, and the northeast wind felt like knives on their faces. He and Township Head Shi Yuxiang led the laborers to dig up the soil dikes built during flood prevention.

　　Comrade Wang Xuecheng was busy from morning till night, often not getting enough sleep. In addition, there was a lot of rain in the spring, and his wounds were always aching, and the joints in his legs were inflamed and sore, making it difficult to walk. But he still insisted on working. One day, he didn't eat a single meal and had a severe headache. Township Head Shi saw that he couldn't hold on any longer and advised him to rest. He said, "When fighting, if the enemy is showing off in front of you, can you put down your weapon? I am a Communist Party member, and I must not leave this battlefield of fighting floods—the dike. I am a revolutionary cadre, and it is glorious to sacrifice personal interests for the people's happiness."

　　Under his influence, the fighting spirit of all the cadres and laborers was enhanced. Eight members of the Communist Youth League, including He Xiuquan, Sun Yiquan, and Yan Xingwang, voluntarily organized a youth stone-pounding team, and they persisted in pounding stones for more than two months. Under his influence, all the laborers completed the spring repair task of 15,000 cubic meters of earth ahead of schedule at an astonishing speed, winning the honorary title of Special-Class Embankment Restoration Model Team.

　　Third-class disabled soldier Huang Jike is a member of the Songwei Agricultural Cooperative. To repair the embankment, he specially bought a new shovel. At daybreak, Huang Jike carried a large red flag and took the lead in calling everyone to the embankment. His soil baskets were always full. When he saw someone was tired from pounding stones, he immediately put down his soil carrying pole and replaced them. The skin on his shoulders was rubbed off, and blisters rose on the palms of his hands, but he still insisted on working. On March 3rd, the tide came, and the water in the Shuangqiao River rose sharply. The mountain flood also washed away the wooden boards they used for taking soil. Seeing the scattered wooden boards being carried away by the waves, Huang Jike didn't hesitate to take off his clothes and jump into the rapids to salvage the wood. The icy water made him shiver all over, and the flesh on his legs turned purple, but he still persisted in the salvage work. He often encouraged everyone in this way: "Although the work of repairing the embankment is arduous, if the embankment is repaired well, life will be better. This is called suffering first and enjoying later. When our volunteers first went abroad, we often ate fried noodles, and if we didn't have water to drink, we ate snow. Later, we drove the American devils south of the 38th parallel, and the comrades often ate rice and white flour, and could also eat canned food. Happiness is earned with blood and sweat!" His actions greatly inspired the laborers.

　　Because the revolutionary veterans and demobilized soldiers demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism in the work of closing breaches and restoring embankments, laborers in the Puji District construction site often praised them: "They are heroes in battle and models in production."

### 修堤战线上的英雄

　　修堤战线上的英雄编辑同志：
    我在江堤上，看到我区很多革命荣誉军人和转业建设军人在堵口修堤工作中，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，保持了革命战士的荣誉。他们的模范行动，深深地教育了我和参加修堤的全体干部、民工。
    二等残废军人王学成同志，是共产党员，在部队时当过军官，这次担任民工指导员。刚刚过了春节，他就带着全乡四百多个民工上堤了。
    他们负责修整的是全县闻名的朱家漾险工段。二月五日天下着雨，王学成冒雨领着大家挖沟排水，从早上一直干到傍晚，一天只吃了一顿饭；第二天，气温降到零下三度，东北风吹到脸上像刀割一样，他又和石玉祥乡长，带领着民工去挖掉防汛时所打下的土牛。
    王学成同志一天忙到晚，晚上常常得不到充分的睡眠，加上春季雨多，他的伤口老是发疼，腿上的关节发炎、发酸，连走路都困难，但他还是坚持工作。有一天，他一顿饭都没有吃，头痛的很厉害，石乡长见他实在支持不住，就劝他休息，他说：“当战斗的时候，敌人在你面前逞凶，你能放下武器吗？我是一个共产党员，我决不能走开这和洪水作战的战场——圩堤。我是一个革命干部，为了人民幸福，牺牲个人利益是光荣的。”
    全队干部和民工在他的影响下，提高了战斗的勇气，青年团员何修全、孙义全、严兴旺等八个人自动组织了一个青年石硪班，他们一直坚持打了两个多月的石硪；在他的影响下，全体民工以惊人的速度第一个提前超额完成了一万五千公方土的春修任务，获得特等复堤模范中队的光荣称号。
    三等残废军人黄际科是宋圩农业社的社员，为了修堤，特地买了一把新锹。天一亮，黄际科就扛着大红旗带头喊大家上堤。他的挑土筐子总是满满的，他看到谁打石硪累了，就立刻放下挑土的担子换谁打石硪。他肩膀上磨脱了皮，手心上磨起了泡，仍然坚持干活。三月三日，潮水来了，双桥河水陡涨了许多，山洪又把他们取土用的木板冲走了。黄际科眼看着零乱的木板跟河水一浪打一浪的漂去，他就毫不犹豫地脱了衣服，跳下激流里打捞木头。冰冷的水冻的他浑身发抖，腿上的肉冻紫了，还是在坚持打捞工作。他经常这样鼓励大家：“修堤的工作虽艰苦，但是，把堤修好了，日子就好过了，这叫做先苦后甜。我们志愿军初出国时经常吃炒面，没有水喝就吃雪，后来把美国鬼子赶到三八线以南，同志们就经常吃到大米和白面，还能吃罐头。幸福是用血汗换来的！”他的行动对民工们起了很大的鼓舞作用。
    由于革命荣誉军人、复员军人在堵口复堤工作中，表现了高度的革命英雄主义精神，因此在濮集区的工地上，民工们常常称赞他们：“战斗中是英雄、生产中是模范”。
