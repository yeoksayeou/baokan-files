　　The Key Lies in Mobilizing the Masses

    After the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on intensifying the rectification of the unified grain purchasing and marketing work, the Party branch secretaries of ten townships, including Wutong Township in the suburbs of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, held a forum together. Based on their work experience over the past period, they unanimously believed that timely rectification of the unified grain purchasing and marketing work could quickly reverse the tense situation of over-selling grain. Although the total planned grain supply for the city's suburban rural areas this year was reduced by 5 million jin compared to the same period last year, many townships promptly combined the implementation of the "three fix" policy and initially mobilized the masses to rectify the unified grain purchasing and marketing work. As a result, they not only effectively guaranteed the supply to grain-deficient households but also saved state grain. By April 20, rural grain sales only reached 54% of the state's planned supply target.
    Many farmers in Huangni Township in the suburbs initially did not understand the state's grain policy and rushed to purchase grain, requesting supplies that exceeded the target by more than double. To reverse this situation, the township leadership immediately convened a meeting of village cadres, first unifying the thinking of Party and League members and activists; letting them publicize the unified purchasing and marketing policy to the masses; and then having the masses review and evaluate the households requesting supplies. As a result, the amount of grain requested by the entire township was reduced from 200,000 jin to 140,000 jin. After education, eight grain-deficient households in Erlang Village, which originally wanted to buy more and buy early, voluntarily reduced their requests by 2,000 jin.
    To ensure a reasonable supply of grain, Wutong Township in the suburbs conducted thorough review work. After announcing the grain supply targets for the entire township, the township leadership also convened the township people's congress, Party and League member congresses, and village residents' group meetings, repeatedly explaining the policies, and adopting democratic evaluation, collective review, and fixed-time and fixed-quantity supply methods to determine the supply figures for each household requesting a supply. In this way, it not only guaranteed the supply to grain-deficient households but also prevented the phenomena of early purchases, needing less but buying more, and hoarding grain for resale, so that the township's supply only reached 50% of the controlled amount for the same period.
    Timely striking at the conspiracies and sabotage of bad elements is of great importance to ensuring the unified marketing work. Wu Renhai, a rich peasant in Xiema Township, took advantage of the township cadres' carelessness to buy 200 jin of rice through deception and spread rumors to incite farmers to rush to buy grain. After the rich peasant's conspiracy was exposed by the masses, the township leadership relied on the masses to reorganize the unified marketing work; the farmers' concerns were eliminated, and the daily grain sales, which had previously reached 5,000 jin, are now only several hundred jin.
    These facts show that as long as the masses are fully mobilized and the unified grain purchasing and marketing work is rectified in a timely manner, the phenomenon of over-selling grain can be completely eliminated.

　　关键在于发动群众
　　纪希晨
    国务院和中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示公布以后，四川省重庆市郊区梧桐乡等十个乡的中共乡支部书记在一起举行了座谈。他们根据自己过去一个时期的工作经验，一致认为及时整顿粮食统销工作，完全可以迅速扭转粮食超销的紧张情势。今年全市郊区农村粮食计划供应总数虽较去年同期减少五百万斤，但由于许多乡及时结合贯彻三定政策，初步发动群众整顿粮食统销工作，因之既切实保证了缺粮户的供应，又节约了国家粮食。到四月二十日止，农村粮食销量只达到国家计划供应指标的百分之五十四。
    郊区黄泥乡许多农民起初因为不了解国家粮食政策，争相抢购粮食，要求供应数超过指标一倍多。为扭转这种情势，乡领导机关立即召开各村干部会议，首先打通党、团员和积极分子思想；让他们分头向群众宣传统销政策；然后由群众对要求供应户进行审查评议。结果全乡要求供应数由二十万斤削减到十四万斤。二朗村原来要多购早购的八家缺粮户，经过教育后，自动减少了两千斤。
    为保证合理供应粮食，郊区梧桐乡进行了周密的评审工作。乡领导机关在公布全乡粮食供应指标后，又召开了乡人民代表大会，党、团员大会和各村居民小组会，反复交代政策，采用民主评议、集体审查和定时定量供应办法，对要求供应户逐户确定供应数字。这样，既保证了缺粮户的供应，又防止了早购、需少购多和存粮套购的现象，使全乡供应数仅及同期控制数的百分之五十。
    及时打击坏分子的阴谋破坏，对保证统销工作具有重大作用。歇马乡富农吴任海利用乡干部的麻痹大意，套购大米两百斤，并造谣煽动农民抢购粮食。后经群众揭发了富农阴谋，乡领导机关又依靠群众重新整顿统销工作；农民顾虑消除了，原来每日粮食销量达五千斤，现在只几百斤了。
    这些事实说明，只要充分发动群众，及时整顿粮食统销工作，是完全可以消除粮食超销现象的。
