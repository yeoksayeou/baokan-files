    Relying on the Masses to Overcome False Phenomena
    Last year, the grain unified purchase and marketing work in Huopai Township, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, was done quite well. However, this spring, people began saying there was a grain shortage. I am the branch secretary of this township, and the district committee asked us to find out how many households actually needed supplies. When we investigated, problems emerged. Take Gaoying Village as an example. Originally, only two people were short of food, but the first time we investigated, we found sixteen households, and the second time, we found twenty-two. Moreover, people were coming to me for supplies before dawn every day. In my own village of one hundred and nine households, eighty percent were saying they needed grain supplies. In Xinfangzi Village, out of thirty-two households, only the agricultural production cooperative's chairman and the production team leader didn't make this request. This confused me. The village cadres and the masses came to ask me what to do. I sought a solution from the district committee, telling them: if the supply problem isn't solved, it will be terrible. The district committee pointed out that our investigation was not thorough and that we were being deceived by false phenomena. We should investigate the situation more carefully. At that time, my thinking wasn't clear, and I complained that the district committee "didn't understand the situation." I had also forgotten that last year's "four retentions" were already sufficient.
    Later, after the branch studied the directives of the prefectural and county committees, and analyzed the situation in the township, we realized that the vast majority of households requesting supplies were being dishonest. For example, during last year's unified grain purchase, the cadres reported the true output and sold more surplus grain, but most of them didn't request grain supplies; the general masses sold less surplus grain, but more of them requested supplies. After explaining the situation and finding the reasons from household to household, we discovered that some people, though clearly not lacking grain, still wanted supplies because they were worried. Middle peasant Li Guozhong sold two hundred catties of grain during last year's unified grain purchase; when it came to supplying grain, he said he was short three hundred catties. So, we supplied him with three hundred catties, and now he is still complaining that it's not enough. In fact, his family of three still has two dan and eight dou of grain, and the one hundred and fifty catties of supply grain coupons that were issued to him, plus his existing reserves, are enough to last him until the new wheat harvest. Of the thirty households in Xinfangzi Village who requested supplies, only two households were short of grain because they had added family members; the remaining twenty-eight households made false reports. After such investigation and analysis, we were able to escape from this confusion.
    After the branch meeting, we convened a meeting of all township cadres. After explaining the situation, finding the reasons, conducting education on increasing production and practicing economy to support national industrialization, and repeatedly publicizing the grain "three fix" policy, the cadres' ideological understanding improved. Out of one hundred and twenty-four people present, forty-one voluntarily reduced their grain supply, totaling one thousand one hundred and fifteen catties of grain. The thirty staff members who had originally been asking for supplies along with the masses, now consciously gave them up. Although this cadre meeting achieved some results, we were not complacent. We knew that only by ideologically mobilizing the masses throughout the township could we completely change the current artificial tension in grain supply work.
    After the meeting, the branch, using the village as a unit, publicized the "three fix" policy to the masses and proposed methods for rectifying the grain unified purchase and marketing work. As a result, many people no longer requested supplies. Li Guoqing of Cheli Village originally wanted supplies, but now not only does he not want them, but he also mobilized his wife to find ways to save a dou of grain. Middle peasant Li Chongyou had grain that he couldn't finish eating, but he was afraid that the "three fix" policy wouldn't hold, so he clamored for supplies. After Li Guoqing's explanation, Li Chongyou realized that he had been worrying needlessly and also stopped asking for supplies. After understanding the policy, middle peasant Li Dequan of Houyuan Village not only stopped asking for more supplies but also saved forty catties of grain. He said: "This is also a little bit of my contribution to supporting industrialization and supporting the liberation of Taiwan." After two days of propaganda and education work, one hundred and ninety-three households out of the original two hundred and ninety-four households requesting supplies in the township voluntarily returned four thousand four hundred and eighty catties of supply grain coupons that had already been issued to them. The township's truly grain-deficient households also received reasonable supplies.
    After mobilizing the masses, not only did the phenomenon of disorderly requests for supplies disappear, but the masses' enthusiasm for production also increased. In two days, the entire township replanted one thousand one hundred and seventeen nests of sunflowers and rushed to plant eight hundred mu of wheat stubble flowers; in seven days, they accumulated four thousand carts of fertilizer and delivered four thousand and ninety-nine carts of fertilizer. Now the masses are actively engaged in production, striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn. (Gao Jinlong)

    Recognizing the Importance of Grain Unified Purchase and Marketing Work
    After the completion of the grain unified purchase work in Shuangyang Township, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, last year, I thought that all the grain that should have been purchased by the state had been sold, and all the grain that the state should have supplied to the peasants had been issued with grain purchase certificates, so there were no more problems. Therefore, when comrades from the work team came to our township recently to help rectify the grain unified purchase and marketing work, I wasn't very welcoming; I thought that rectifying grain unified purchase and marketing was a "waste of manpower and resources," and we couldn't rectify anything more in our township. As the township's branch secretary, I dealt with the comrades from the work team superficially when they consulted with me, and my work enthusiasm wasn't high. When the village held cadre meetings, I also had an attitude of "a little monk chanting scriptures, just going through the motions." In fact, I had incorrect practices in handling the grain supply problem in my own family. If my family calculated carefully, we could reduce our purchase of three hundred catties of revolving grain from the state. But I had the idea of "being generous when things are easy and frugal when things are tight," and I was also afraid that if I bought less, the masses would say that I wasn't thorough in selling grain, so I didn't reduce the supply amount realistically.
    On April 27th, the township held an enlarged meeting of the Party branch committee. The comrade from the district used specific examples from our locality to analyze the current artificial tension in grain supply. He said that many landlords and rich peasants were sabotaging unified purchase and marketing, many farmers who were not short of grain were buying more grain from the state, while a few truly grain-deficient households were not being supplied. He said that everyone should set an example and do a good job in rectifying the grain unified purchase and marketing work. After the meeting, I thought about his words carefully in relation to myself. I thought about how before liberation I was a hired hand in the landlord's house, contributing the strength of an ox but eating pig feed. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, I was allocated ten mu and eight fen of land, a house, and farm tools such as carts during the land reform. In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I joined the Party, participated in the agricultural production cooperative, and became the chairman. Every step of the way, from the land reform to the cooperative movement, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to live better lives. Now, seeing the artificial tension in grain supply and the possibility of exceeding the grain sales targets, can we remain indifferent? I began to blame myself from the bottom of my heart for my complacency and paralysis, and criticized the wrong idea of seeing the rectification of grain unified purchase and marketing as a "waste of manpower and resources."
    After returning home, I convened a family meeting, criticized the selfish and self-interested thinking of only caring about oneself, "being generous when things are easy and frugal when things are tight," and disregarding the national plan. I decided to supplement our diet with more than one hundred catties of wheat, plant more than one hundred pumpkin seedlings, and replant some sorghum, and to save grain through careful calculations. I also immediately asked the state to reduce the supply amount by three hundred catties on the original grain purchase certificate. Then, together with the comrades from the work team, I relied on the masses and patiently educated them, conducting a detailed investigation and discovering many unreasonable supply phenomena. In our Shuangxi Lu Village, the households that had already been issued grain purchase certificates had a supply amount of six thousand and thirty-five catties, a revolving amount of thirty-seven thousand three hundred and sixty-one catties, totaling forty-three thousand three hundred and ninety-six catties. This amount of grain could supply more than eighty percent of the village's population until the new rice harvest, which was obviously very unreasonable. Rich peasant Zhang Ashao had grain that he couldn't finish eating and transferred his grain purchase certificate to relatives to purchase one thousand one hundred and ninety-four catties of rice fraudulently; landlord Wo Zonghao actually needed two hundred catties of revolving grain but asked the state for five hundred and seventy-six catties more. This kind of unreasonable phenomenon was quite common in our township. The Party branch led the purchase and sales evaluation team, on the one hand, resolutely reducing the numbers that should not be supplied, could be supplied less, or could be supplied later, based on the actual situation; on the other hand, under the principle of frugality, effectively ensuring the necessary supply for grain-deficient households. After preliminary rectification, the supply amount was reduced by more than twenty percent. (Wu Chunrong)

    Achieving Reasonable Grain Supply
    Cui Shao Village in Nanxinzhuang Township, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, was also a village that was crying out for a grain shortage. Especially after the grain supply certificates were issued, the number of "grain-deficient households" increased. People went to the township and village cadres every day to ask for grain supplies. The township and village staff were very troubled, and some of them joined the masses in saying there was a "grain shortage" and asked the state to supply more grain.
    After discovering this situation, the Tunliu County Party Committee, led by Secretary Hu Fan, sent a work team to Cui Shao Village to rectify the grain supply work. They first convened a meeting of Party members, explained the Party's policies, and studied the overall grain supply situation in the village. At first, some people insisted that there was "indeed a grain shortage," but after calculating the village's actual production and consumption accounts, the resistance began to turn around. For example, Party member Wang Zhenlin said that he harvested three thousand catties of grain, but in fact, his payments of public grain, sales of surplus grain, and investments in the cooperative amounted to three thousand and one hundred catties, plus the grain that his family had eaten for more than half a year, the total was much more than the output he reported. After this calculation, everyone understood that many people were falsely reporting "grain shortages" based on a reduced actual output. In this way, many Party members made automatic self-criticisms. Party member Wu Kuizhang said: "I was originally going to be short of grain in June, but I started shouting about it in early spring, mainly because I was afraid of 'not being supplied.' Now I know that 'reporting a shortage early' will affect other households if they follow suit, and this is not right." After criticism and self-criticism, seven Party members who had falsely reported grain shortages declared that they did not need the state to supply grain.
    On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of Party members, cadres and Party members were divided into groups to mobilize the masses, explaining to the masses in detail the state's grain supply methods of supplying more when there is more, supplying less when there is less, and not supplying when there is no shortage. They used the facts of correcting the "reporting a shortage early" and "reporting a shortage when there is no shortage" among Party members and cadres to enlighten the masses, and also criticized some people's erroneous behaviors of "reporting more when there is less" and "falsely reporting a grain shortage." The masses were educated, and many people automatically reported their actual grain shortage. Some said: The state's grain supply policy is the fairest and most reasonable. If households that are not short of grain also receive supply grain, what will the state use to supply grain-deficient households? Farmers Zhang Tuzhe, Wang Dacheng, and Wang Xiangen, and twenty-six other households, all voluntarily proposed to reduce the amount of grain supply.
    Next, an evaluation committee was organized to conduct the evaluation. As a result, the number of grain-deficient households decreased from ninety-six to forty-one, and the grain supply decreased from thirty-six thousand catties to eight thousand and five hundred catties. Supply certificates were reissued to the truly grain-deficient households, and supplies were provided in stages according to the actual situation. In this way, the masses' emotions stabilized, and they all actively engaged in the spring plowing production campaign.

    发挥党组织在整顿粮食统销工作中的作用
    依靠群众克服了虚假现象
    去年，湖北省襄阳县伙牌乡里的粮食统购统销工作搞的还不错，但是，到了今年春上却有人说着缺粮。我是本乡的支部书记，区委叫我们摸一摸到底有多少户需要供应。一摸，问题出来了。拿郜营村来说，本来只有两个人缺点吃的，但是头一回就摸出了十六户，第二回又摸出了二十二户。而且每天天不亮就有人找我要供应。我住的这个村里一百零九户就有百分之八十叫着要供应粮食。新房子村三十二户，只有一个农业生产合作社社长和生产队长没提出这个要求。这一来把我弄糊涂了。各村干部和群众跑来问我怎办？我就找区委解决，向区委说：供应问题不解决不得了。区委指出我们摸底不实，被虚假现象迷惑住了，应该再仔细了解一下情况。当时我的思想不通，埋怨区委“不了解情况”。这时，我把去年“四留”已留足的事实也忘记了。
    后来，支部学习了地委和县委的指示，结合着分析了乡里的情况，才认清要求供应的户数绝大多数都是虚假的。比方去年统购统销时，干部的产量报的实，余粮卖的也较多，但是绝大多数没要求供应粮食；一般群众卖的余粮少，要供应的反倒多。经过逐户摆情况，找原因，发现有些人明明不缺粮食，但却要供应，顾虑很大。中农李国忠，去年粮食统购时他卖了两百斤粮；到供应粮食时，他却说缺粮三百斤。于是就供应了他三百斤，现在他还吵着接不上。其实，他家三口人，还有二石八斗粮食，已发给他的一百五十斤供应粮票，光存粮就足够吃到接上新麦子下来。新房子村要求供应的三十户，只有两户因为添人缺粮，其余二十八户都是虚报的。经过这样一摸一分析，我们才从糊涂窝里跳出来。
    支部会后，接着召开了全乡干部会。经过摆情况，找原因，进行增产节约支援国家工业化的教育，反复宣传了粮食“三定”政策，干部的思想认识提高了一步。到会一百二十四人，自愿减少供应粮食的四十一人，计粮食一千一百一十五斤。原来随着群众要求供应的三十个工作人员，现在也自觉地不要了。这次干部会虽然取得了一些成绩，但我们并没有麻痹。我们知道：只有把全乡群众从思想上发动起来，才能彻底改变当前粮食供应工作中人为的紧张情况。
    会后，支部以村为单位向群众宣传“三定”政策，并提出整顿粮食统销工作的办法。这样许多人不再要求供应了。车李村李国清原来也要供应，现在不但不要供应，还动员他老婆想办法节约了一斗粮食。中农李崇有粮食吃不完，因为怕“三定”政策定不住，吵着要供应，经李国清一宣传，李崇有认识到自己错耽了心，也不再要供应了。侯元村中农李德全了解政策后，除了不再多要求供应，还节约了四十斤粮食。他说：“这也是我支援工业化、支援解放台湾的一点心意。”经过两天的宣传教育工作，全乡原来要求供应的二百九十四户，现在有一百九十三户自动退回已经发给他们的四千四百八十斤供应粮票。乡里真正缺粮户也得到了合理供应。
    把群众发动起来后，不光是乱要供应的现象没有了，而且群众的生产劲头也大了。两天时间全乡补种向日葵一万零一百一十七窝，抢种麦茬花八百亩；七天时间积肥四千车，送肥四千零九十九车。现在群众正积极搞生产，争取秋季丰收。（郜金龙）
      认识粮食统销工作的重要
    浙江省嘉兴县双阳乡在去年粮食统购工作结束以后，我认为应该统购的粮食已全部卖给国家，国家应该供应给农民的粮食也全部发了购粮证，没什么问题了。因此，最近工作组的同志到我们乡里来帮助整顿粮食统销工作，开始时我不大欢迎；认为整顿粮食统销是“劳民伤财”的事，我们乡里再也整顿不出啥名堂来了。我是乡的支部书记，工作组的同志和我商量问题，我当面应付应付，工作劲头不大。村里开干部会，我也抱着“小和尚念经，有口无心”的态度。其实，我处理自己家里的粮食供应问题，就有不正确的地方。我家里只要精打细算一些，可以少向国家买三百斤周转粮。但是我有“宽打窄用”的想法，又怕少买了群众说我卖粮不彻底，因此没有实事求是地减少供应量。
    四月二十七日，乡里召开了党支部委员会扩大会议。区上来的同志以本地的具体例子，分析现在粮食供应中存在着人为的紧张情况。不少地主、富农破坏统销，不少不缺粮的农民向国家多买粮食，而少数真正缺粮户反而没有得到供应。他说大家应当以身作则，作好整顿粮食统销工作。开会以后，我联系自己，把他的话细细地想了再想。我想到解放前我是地主家里的长工，出的牛力，吃的猪食。解放后，在共产党、人民政府的领导下，土地改革时分进了十亩八分田，一间房子，还有车盘等农具。几年来在党的培养教育下，我入了党，参加了农业生产合作社，当了社长。共产党、毛主席领导我们从土地改革到现在走合作化的道路，哪一件事不是为了我们过好日子？现在眼看着粮食供应中的人为紧张现象，销粮指标有突破的可能，我们能够不闻不问吗？我开始从心底里责备了自己的自满麻痹情绪，批判了把整顿粮食统销看成是“劳民伤财”的错误思想。
    回家后，我就召开了家庭会议，批判了只顾自己，“宽打窄用”，不管国家计划的自私自利思想，决定搭吃一百多斤小麦，多种一百多棵南瓜秧和补种一部分高粱，精打细算节约粮食。我还马上要求国家在原发购粮证上，减去供应量三百斤。接着我和工作组的同志一起，依靠群众和耐心教育群众，进行细致的摸底，发现了很多供应不合理的现象。我们双溪露字村已经发购粮证的户，供应量六千零三十五斤，周转量三万七千三百六十一斤，总共四万三千三百九十六斤。这些粮食可以供应全村百分之八十以上的人口吃到新稻登场，这显然是很不合理的。富农张阿绍有粮吃不完，转借购粮证给亲戚套购大米一千一百九十四斤；地主沃宗浩实际需要周转粮二百斤，还向国家多要求周转粮五百七十六斤。相反的，贫农吴荣木真正缺粮四百斤，却没有领到购粮证。这种不合理的现象，在我们乡里是相当普遍的。党支部领导征购销评议小组，一方面根据实际情况，把不应供应、可以少供应或推迟供应的数字，坚决地削减下来；另方面在节约的原则下，切实保证缺粮户必不可少的供应。经过初步整顿，供应量就减少了百分之二十以上。（吴春荣）
    做到合理供应粮食
    山西屯留县南辛庄乡崔邵村也是叫喊缺粮的一个村子，特别是发了粮食供应证后，“缺粮户”越来越多，每天有人找乡、村干部要求供应粮食。乡、村工作人员弄得很苦恼，有的就跟着群众一起说“缺粮”，要求国家多多供应粮食。
    中共屯留县委发现这一情况后，就由书记胡璠同志带领一个工作组到崔邵村整顿粮食供应工作。他们首先召开党员大会，讲解了党的政策，研究了全村的粮食供应情况。开始有些人还坚持“确实缺粮”的意见，但算了全村的实产和消费账后，抵触情绪开始扭转。如党员王振林说他打粮三千斤，其实他缴公粮、卖余粮和社内投资就达三千一百斤，再加上半年多家里人吃了的粮食，总数比他报的产量多得多了。经过这样一算，大家明白了原来许多人就是在缩小实产量的基础上假报“缺粮”。这样，许多党员自动做了检讨。党员武奎章说：“我本来是六月份才缺粮，可是一开春就叫喊开了，主要是怕‘供应不上’，现在知道‘迟缺早报’就会影响别的户也照样行事，这是不对的。”经过批评和自我批评，七个假报缺粮的党员，都申明不要国家供应。
    在党员思想提高的基础上，干部和党员又分组分片去发动群众，给群众详细讲了国家缺多供多，缺少供少，不缺不供的粮食供应方法，并用纠正党员干部中“迟缺早报”和“不缺报缺”的事实来启发群众，同时也批判了有些人“缺少报多”和“假报缺粮”的错误行为。群众受到了教育，许多人就自动地实报了缺粮数。有的说：国家的粮食供应政策是最公平合理的，如果不缺粮的户也领了供应粮，国家拿什么来供应缺粮户。农民张秃则、王大成和王先根等二十九户，都自动提出减少粮食供应量。
    接着，组织评议委员会进行了评议。结果，缺粮户由九十六户减少到四十一户，供应粮食由三万六千斤减少到八千五百斤，真正缺粮户重新发给他们供应证，按照实际情况，分期进行供应。这样，群众的情绪安定了，都积极投入春耕生产运动。
