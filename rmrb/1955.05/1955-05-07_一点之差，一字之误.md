　　A Slight Difference, a Single Character Mistake
　　Xiǎo Yì
    When the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory was preparing its 1954 foreign order plan, it decided to purchase "7.9" tons of equilateral angle steel. The person responsible for copying the plan wrote "79" instead of "7.9" when transcribing the plan. As the saying goes, "A miss is as good as a mile." Missing a decimal point caused the plan to expand ninefold. This plan was submitted to responsible cadres at all levels in the factory for review, but no one noticed the missing decimal point. Moreover, to be "safe," a domestic order was also placed simultaneously. As a result, both batches of orders arrived, and instead of the original 7.9 tons, there were suddenly 160 tons. There was no choice but to stockpile more than 90% of the excess angle steel. At market prices, these stockpiled materials were worth more than 100,000 yuan.
    Similar "slight difference" errors are not isolated incidents in life. Please consider another example that occurred in Luoyang City.
    When winter construction began in 1954, the construction technology section of a construction unit in Luoyang proposed a plan to purchase more than 200,000 kilograms of rice straw mats. However, during the process of review and modification, the original plan to buy only more than 200,000 "kilograms" of rice straw mats was transformed into a plan to buy more than 200,000 "pieces" of straw mats. To complete this massive plan, the materials supply department organized two large working groups to go to Nanjing, Xinyang, and other places to purchase the mats. Unfortunately, when this great "plan" was completed, the winter construction was coming to an end, and spring had arrived. The employees calculated that this single character error resulted in the waste of more than 280,000 yuan.
    See, how much waste can be caused by an error of one character or one decimal point!
    Currently, some people look down on the work of copying, calculating, and auditing figures, considering it "technical" and "low-level." They adopt a careless and sloppy attitude towards it, thinking that there are many responsible staff members reviewing at various levels anyway, so their carelessness "doesn't matter." Of course, if the people responsible for auditing are meticulous, they can find many errors. If they happen to be not meticulous and casually stamp their approval, then through this top-down cooperation, a large amount of state property is lost due to the error of a single character or decimal point.
    The arduous, complex, and large-scale economic construction requires state personnel to treat every "small" task diligently, cautiously, and responsibly. It requires leaders at all levels to be conscientious and work in a down-to-earth manner in their specific leadership roles. Any loss to the state caused by mere negligence is intolerable to any patriotic citizen.

### 一点之差，一字之误

　　一点之差，一字之误
　　晓逸
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂在编制一九五四年国外订货计划的时候，决定购买“七·九”吨等边角钢。负责抄写的人在誊写计划书时，把“七·九”写成了“七九”。俗话说得好，“失之毫厘，差之千里”，漏掉了一点，计划就扩大了九倍。这份计划送给厂里的各级负责干部审阅，谁也没有发现这被遗漏的一点；而且为了“保险”，同时又在国内订购了一份。结果，两批订货全部到达了，原来只要七点九吨，现在一下子来了一百六十吨。没有办法，只好把多余的百分之九十以上的边角钢积压起来。按市场价格计算，这批积压物资价值约十万多元。
    类似这样“一点之差”的错误，在生活中并不是个别的。请再看发生在洛阳市的例子。
    一九五四年冬季施工开始的时候，洛阳一个建筑单位的施工技术科提出了一个购买二十多万公斤稻草席的计划，但在层层审核修改的过程中，把原来只准备买二十多万“公斤”稻草席的计划，竟变成了要买二十多万“块”草席。为了完成这个庞大的计划，材料供应处组织了两个庞大的工作组，分赴南京，信阳等地收购。遗憾的是，当这个伟大的“计划”完成时，冬季施工已近尾声，春天已经来临。职工们算了算账，由于这一字之误，浪费了资金二十八万多元。
    请看，一个字，一个小数点的错误，造成的浪费有多么大！
    现在有些人就是看不起这些抄写、计算、审核数目字的工作，觉得这是“技术性”的、“低级”的工作，对它采取了潦潦草草、马马虎虎的态度。认为反正还有好多负责工作人员层层审查，自己马虎点“不要紧”。当然，如果负责审核的人精细一点，是可以发现很多错误的。如果碰上不精细的人，拿起图章顺手一盖，这样上下一配合，国家的财产就被错误的一字和一点大量地断送掉了。
    艰苦、复杂，规模宏大的经济建设事业，要求国家工作人员必须勤恳谨慎、认真负责地对待每一件“细小”的工作，要求各级领导人员必须兢兢业业，踏踏实实地进行具体的领导。仅仅因为疏忽而给国家造成损失，是任何一个爱国的公民都不能容忍的。
