Xinhua News Agency, London: The British election campaign has entered its final stage—only two days remain until the general election today. British politicians are trying to influence voters in various ways, but 35 million voters remain very indifferent to the election.
    Reuters called this campaign "the most dull and lifeless campaign of this century." Reuters said that the widespread voter apathy towards the general election has "embarrassed" British politicians, who even consider this atmosphere to be "frightening."
    Voters are apathetic to the campaign because they see no significant difference between the Conservative Party's and the Labor Party's campaign platforms and promises. People hope to get answers from the candidates to the most pressing issues of international affairs that everyone cares about: the issue of peace, the issue of banning weapons of mass destruction, and the issue of universal disarmament. However, many Conservative and Labor candidates deliberately avoid these issues.
    It is worth noting that Richard Acland, who resigned from the Labor Party in protest against the Labor Party's right-wing leaders' support for the government's decision to produce hydrogen bombs, received widespread support from voters when he ran as an independent. According to newspaper reports, voters raised a large sum of campaign funds for him.

### 英国选民对大选十分冷淡

　  英国选民对大选十分冷淡
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国的竞选运动已经进入最后阶段——今天离大选已只有两天了。英国政界人士企图用各种方法影响选民，但是，三千五百万选民对大选仍然十分冷淡。
    路透社把这次竞选运动叫做“这个世纪里最乏味和最没有生气的竞选运动”。路透社说，广大选民对大选漠不关心的情况使得英国的政界人士“感到为难”，他们甚至认为这种气氛“是令人害怕的”。
    选民们对竞选冷淡是因为他们看不出保守党同工党的竞选纲领和诺言有什么重大不同。人们希望从候选人那里得到大家所关怀的国际局势中最迫切的问题的答复，这些问题是：和平问题，禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题，进行普遍裁军问题。但是，保守党和工党的许多候选人却有意回避这些问题。
    值得注意的是：因为抗议工党右翼领导支持政府生产氢弹的决定而退出工党的理查德·艾克兰德在作为无党派人士参加竞选时，他获得了选民广泛的支持。据报纸消息：选民为他募集了一大笔竞选费用。
