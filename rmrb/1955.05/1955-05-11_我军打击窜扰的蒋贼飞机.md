Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 8th. From May 1st to 7th, a total of 28 batches of 82 sorties of Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes intruded and harassed our coastal areas of Fujian. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes also bombed and strafed fishing boats and residents in the coastal areas.

Our People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units struck the intruding Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes. At 11:05 AM on May 4th, three Chiang Kai-shek F-47 aircraft intruded into the airspace over Haicheng County, Fujian Province from the direction of Jinmen Island, and dropped three bombs on fishing boats and fishermen on the sea and beach near Daomei Town. Our anti-aircraft artillery units immediately launched fierce fire, damaging all the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes. One heavily damaged Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane escaped, emitting black smoke.
