　　Secretary-General of Tunisian Neo-Destour Party Issues Statement
　　Opposing France's Attempt to Extend its Colonial Rule in Tunisia
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th. Salah Ben Youssef, Secretary-General of the Tunisian Neo-Destour Party, who attended the Asian-African Conference as an observer, issued a statement in Cairo newspapers and radio stations on the 16th, calling on the Tunisian people to rise up against the French-Tunisian draft agreement on granting Tunisia "internal autonomy." Youssef emphasized that this agreement would only "help extend the life of the colonial system, under which Tunisia has already lived for seventy-four years."
    According to Agence France-Presse, Paris, France and Tunisia are currently negotiating in Paris to finalize the draft agreement. It is known that this draft agreement was hastily drafted by representatives of the French and Tunisian authorities during the Asian-African Conference. The reason France hurriedly drafted this agreement was to evade the Asian-African Conference's severe condemnation of France's colonial policy in North Africa, consolidate France's position in Tunisia, and divide the Tunisian national independence movement. The draft agreement stipulates that France controls Tunisia's diplomacy, defense, and public security, while administration, justice, and education are jointly managed by the French and Tunisians. Salah Ben Youssef pointed out after the draft agreement was announced that the "autonomy" stipulated in the draft agreement is "a completely impractical and deceptive autonomy."

　　突尼斯新宪政党总书记发表声明
　　反对法国力图延长它在突尼斯的殖民统治
    新华社十九日讯　开罗消息：曾经以观察员身份出席亚非会议的突尼斯新宪政党总书记赛拉·优素福十六日在开罗的报纸和广播电台发表声明，号召突尼斯人民起来反对法国同突尼斯的关于给突尼斯“内政自治”的协定草案。优素福着重指出：这个协定只会“有助于延长殖民制度的寿命，突尼斯在这个制度下已经生活了七十四年了”。
    据法新社巴黎消息，目前法国同突尼斯正在巴黎谈判，以便最后审定这个协定草案。大家知道，这个协定草案是在亚非会议期间由法国和突尼斯当局的代表匆匆拟订的。法国之所以要急忙拟出这个协定草案，是为了逃避亚非会议对法国在北非的殖民政策的严厉指责、巩固法国在突尼斯的地位以及分化突尼斯的民族独立运动。这个协定草案规定：法国控制突尼斯的外交、国防和治安，而行政、司法和教育则由法国人和突尼斯人共同掌管。赛拉·优素福在协定草案公布后曾经指出：协定草案所规定的“自治”是“一种完全不实际的骗人的自治”。
