The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in many parts of the country began to conduct wholesale business with rural private merchants this spring. This is an extremely important change for grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives that previously only engaged in retail business and did not wholesale to private merchants. According to statistics from 80% of the country's grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, the wholesale volume to rural private merchants in January accounted for 5.2% of the retail volume of the supply and marketing cooperatives, 7.1% in February, and 8.5% in March, with an overall upward trend. However, the wholesale business that supply and marketing cooperatives conduct with private merchants is still far from meeting the requirements of comprehensively arranging the rural market. The wholesale plans of most supply and marketing cooperatives have not been completed, while the retail business continues to develop. This has prevented the tension in public-private relations in the rural market from further easing, and the stagnation in urban-rural material exchange has not been fundamentally changed. Now that we have entered the slow season for commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives should rapidly expand wholesale business, comprehensively arrange for private merchants, and strive to invigorate the rural market. This is of great benefit to promoting the development of industry and agriculture and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

However, at present, in the vast rural areas across the country, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives cannot fully meet the needs of the vast number of farmers for purchasing means of production and living materials, and selling local and special products. The business of existing private merchants is also subject to many restrictions. This situation should be changed. In addition to making necessary controls and contractions in the retail business, supply and marketing cooperatives should use their main strength to conduct wholesale business with private merchants. Only by conducting wholesale business with private merchants can we give play to their positive role in the national economy and the people's livelihood, gradually overcome the stagnation in urban-rural material exchange; and restrict and prevent their destructive effect on the national economy and the people's livelihood, gradually bring their business into the orbit of the national planned economy, and realize the socialist transformation of rural private merchants.

Many cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives, especially grassroots cadres directly responsible for arranging the rural market, still have many erroneous understandings and ideological concerns about wholesaling goods to private merchants. They are still unwilling to wholesale goods to private merchants; and when they have to do so, they try to arrange for smaller business volumes for private merchants, reduce the variety of goods wholesaled as much as possible, set the price differences and handling fees as low as possible, and allocate unpopular and slow-selling goods to private merchants. Therefore, resolving the confused thinking of cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives on these issues is the key to rationally arranging the rural market and further developing wholesale business with private merchants.

Some people say, "Supply and marketing cooperatives conducting wholesale business with private merchants is developing capitalism." This view is wrong. Supply and marketing cooperatives appropriately reduce retail business and increase wholesale business, and their total business volume will not decrease; and supply and marketing cooperatives conducting wholesale business, making full use of the manpower, funds, and management technology of rural private merchants, they can free up strength from the heavy retail business, improve and enhance the internal operation and management of supply and marketing cooperatives, strengthen leadership over the entire rural market, strengthen supervision over private merchants, organize the circulation of commodities in rural areas according to the national plan, and stabilize prices.

Some people say, "Rural private merchants are not easy to lead." They regard all rural private merchants as commercial capitalists, and ignore the fact that the vast majority of them can be organized through the road of mutual assistance and cooperation as small merchants and peddlers. It cannot be denied that small merchants and peddlers also have speculative ideas; however, if supply and marketing cooperatives strengthen education and supervision over small merchants and peddlers, they can gradually overcome their speculative and opportunistic business thinking and business habits, and bring their business into the plan of supply and marketing cooperatives. Even for commercial capitalists, today we still give them overall arrangements in wholesale business. Fearing that private merchants are not easy to lead, and unwilling to arrange for them through wholesale business, this shows that some cadres still have a fear of difficulty in implementing the policy of "overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and active transformation," and this emotion must be overcome.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas have earnestly implemented the policy of overall arrangement and expanded wholesale business, which has rapidly invigorated the local rural market. Take Baifang Town in the second district of Changning County, Hunan Province, as an example. The total retail sales of the market in this town in February decreased by 54.6% compared with January, that is to say, before the slow season arrived, the business of both supply and marketing cooperatives and private merchants had shrunk. The supply and marketing cooperative strived to develop wholesale business from March, and its total business volume in the first half of March increased by 13.5% compared with the entire month of February (of which the wholesale volume to private merchants accounted for 45.1% of the total business volume); private merchants also saw an increase in business volume due to the reliable source of goods. As a result, some scattered commodities of the supply and marketing cooperative were no longer stockpiled, the masses found it more convenient to buy things, the enthusiasm of small traders was enhanced, and the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative also realized the benefits of opening up wholesale business from practical work. He Yuesheng, the deputy director of this supply and marketing cooperative, said: "In the past, we only did retail business, and we were busy to death, and the masses still complained; after opening up wholesale business, not only do we have the energy to do more important work, but even study and life systems can be adhered to."

In the work of conducting wholesale business and arranging the market, supply and marketing cooperatives should also prevent right-leaning tendencies. Now a small number of areas have already seen such a situation: supply and marketing cooperatives do not study the market situation, the retail business shrinks too sharply, and even all or most of the important commodities that private merchants have long ceased to operate or rarely operate are all or mostly given to private merchants to operate; some private merchants take the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. This practice is also wrong and must be opposed.

It is very difficult to conduct wholesale business solely by grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. The leading bodies of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must concentrate a certain amount of strength to deeply and specifically help grassroots cooperatives solve various problems encountered in their work, help grassroots cooperatives organize sources of goods, stipulate wholesale prices, and establish and improve wholesale institutions. Otherwise, the wholesale business of grassroots cooperatives will not be developed well.

At present, party committees and government departments in various places are busy leading spring plowing and production, consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, and grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" and other central tasks. While carrying out these tasks, we should spare a certain amount of strength to appropriately take care of the work of arranging rural private merchants. In order to arrange private merchants and invigorate the rural market, a lot of economic and political work needs to be done. Without the unified leadership and support of party committees and government departments, the arrangement work cannot be carried out smoothly. Party committees at all levels, especially the prefectural and county party committees, must quickly convey the policy of "overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and active transformation" to district and township cadres and cadres of the financial and economic system, and organize discussions and studies in conjunction with the local market situation, so that the vast number of grassroots cadres can clearly understand the important significance of implementing the above-mentioned policies. As long as all relevant departments cooperate closely under the unified leadership of the local party committee, rural private merchants can be arranged quickly, and the rural market can be quickly invigorated.

### 对农村私商的批发业务必须加强

　　对农村私商的批发业务必须加强
    今年春季全国许多地区的基层供销合作社开始举办对农村私商的批发业务。这对过去只经营零售业务，不对私商作批发业务的基层供销合作社来说，是一个极其重要的改变。根据全国百分之八十的基层供销社的统计，一月份对农村私商的批发额为供销社零售额的百分之五点二，二月份为百分之七点一，三月份为百分之八点五，总趋势是逐月上升的；但是，目前供销合作社对私商举办的批发业务，距离全面安排农村市场的要求还很远，多数地区的供销社的批发计划都没有完成，而零售业务却在继续发展。这就使得农村市场方面的公私关系的紧张情况没有进一步缓和，城乡物资交流中的某种滞塞现象也没有根本改变过来。现在已经进入商业淡季，供销社应该迅速扩大批发业务，全面安排私商，努力活跃农村市场。这对于促进工农业生产的发展，对于巩固工农联盟，都有很大的好处。
    但是，目前在全国范围的广大农村中，基层供销社并不能完全满足广大农民的购买生产资料、生活资料和销售土产、特产的要求，现有私商的营业又受了很多限制。这种情况应该改变。供销社除了在零售业务方面应作必要的控制和收缩以外，还应该以主要力量举办对私商的批发业务。只有对私商举办批发业务，才能发挥他们对国计民生的积极作用，逐步克服城乡物资交流中的某种滞塞现象；并限制和防止他们对国计民生的破坏作用，把他们的经营逐步纳入国家计划经济的轨道，实现对农村私商的社会主义改造。
    许多供销社的干部，特别是直接负责安排农村市场的基层干部，对于给私商批发货物，还有不少错误认识和思想顾虑。他们还不愿意给私商批发货物；而在不得不作的时候，就设法把私商的营业额安排得小些，把批发的货物品种尽量减少，把差价和手续费尽量订得低，并给私商分配冷货背货。因此，解决供销社干部在这些问题上的糊涂思想，乃是合理地安排农村市场，进一步开展对私商的批发业务的关键。
    有人说，“供销社对私商举办批发业务，就是发展资本主义”。这种看法是错误的。供销社适当地减少零售业务，增加批发业务，它的总营业额不会减少；而供销社举办批发业务，尽量利用农村私商的人力、资金和经营技术，它就可以从繁重的零售业务中抽出力量，改善和提高供销社内部的经营管理，加强对整个农村市场的领导，加强对私商的监督，根据国家计划组织农村的商品流转，并稳定物价。
    有人说，“农村私商不容易领导”。他们把农村私商一律都当成了商业资本家，而忽视了他们当中的绝大部分是可以通过互助合作道路组织起来的小商小贩。不能否认，小商小贩也都有投机思想；但是，供销社如果加强对小商小贩的教育和监督，就可以逐渐克服他们的投机取巧的经营思想和经营习惯，把他们的经营纳入供销社的计划中。即便对于商业资本家，今天在批发业务上，我们仍然是给予统筹安排的。害怕私商不好领导，不愿意通过批发业务去安排他们，这就说明某些干部对执行“统筹兼顾，全面安排，积极改造”的政策还有畏难情绪，而这种情绪是必须克服的。
    许多地区的供销社认真地执行统筹安排的政策，扩大了批发业务，已经使当地的农村市场迅速活跃起来。拿湖南常宁县二区柏坊镇做例子。这个镇二月份的市场零售总额比一月份下降了百分之五十四点六，就是说，淡季尚未到来，供销社和私商的营业都已萎缩。供销社从三月份努力开展批发业务，它在三月上半月的营业总额就比二月份全月增加了百分之十三点五（其中对私商批发额占营业总额的百分之四十五点一）；私商由于有了可靠的货源，营业额也上升了。这样一来，供销社的某些零星商品再也不积压了，群众买东西方便了，小商贩的经营积极性提高了，供销社的干部也从实际工作中体会到开办批发业务的好处。这个供销社的副主任何月生说：“过去我们专作零售业务，忙死也忙不过来，群众还埋怨；开办批发业务以后，不但有了精力做更多的重要工作，就连学习和生活制度也可以坚持了。”
    供销社在举办批发业务、安排市场的工作中，同样要防止右的倾向。现在少数地区已经发生了这样一种情况：供销社对市场情况不作研究，零售业务收缩过猛，甚至把私商早已不再经营或很少经营的重要商品全部或大部让给私商去经营；有些私商乘机抬高物价，扰乱市场。这种做法也是错误的，必须加以反对。
    单靠基层供销社举办批发业务是有很多困难的。各级供销社的领导机构必须集中一定的力量，深入、具体地帮助基层社解决工作中遇到的各种问题，帮助基层社组织货源、规定批发价格、建立和健全批发机构。否则基层社的批发业务就不会很好地开展起来。
    现在各地党委和政府部门正忙于领导春耕生产，整顿和巩固农业生产合作社以及粮食的“定产、定购、定销”等中心工作。在进行这些工作的同时，应该抽出一定的力量，适当地照顾安排农村私商的工作。为了安排私商，活跃农村市场，需要做许多经济工作和政治工作，如果没有党委和政府部门的统一领导和支持，安排工作就不能顺利进行。各级党委、特别是地委和县委，必须把“统筹兼顾，全面安排，积极改造”的政策，迅速传达到区乡干部和财经系统的干部中去，结合当地的市场情况，组织讨论和学习，使广大基层干部都能明确认识贯彻上述政策的重要意义。只要各个有关部门在当地党委的统一领导下密切合作，农村私商就可以很快地得到安排，农村市场就可以很快地活跃起来。
