　　Hu Feng's Ugly Face
　　Wu Zuguang
    Since many newspapers and magazines have launched criticisms of Hu Feng's erroneous thinking, the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist ideological essence of Hu Feng has been gradually exposed. During this period, we have heard many speeches and discussions and read many articles; however, nothing has made us more clearly recognize Hu Feng's ugly and insidious inner self and hypocritical face through comparison than the simultaneous publication of Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" in the "People's Daily" on May 13. In fact, the main content of Shu Wu's article was written by Hu Feng himself. His "self-criticism" is just something to decorate the facade, while these secret letters he wrote to Shu Wu are his ideological essence and actual actions.
    Many comrades who are actively working in literary and art circles today lived with Hu Feng in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. We all remember very clearly how closely we were united around the Communist Party during that dark and terrifying period of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, taking the Party and the people's revolution as our light and hope. We fought the enemy in various ways. Everyone understood that commemorating Qu Yuan, commemorating Lu Xun, commemorating the May Fourth Movement... these activities were revolutionary calls and enlightenments for the vast majority of people who yearned for the light. Hu Feng himself had always participated in these activities, but in his secret letters, he added such vicious curses to these activities: Hu Feng said that Mr. Wen Yiduo, who was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and deeply mourned by the people, was "speculating... and hit the jackpot"; when people commemorated the ninth anniversary of the death of the great Mr. Lu Xun, Hu Feng sarcastically said that "commemorating the dead" was his "disaster"; when people are horrified at the brutal tortures in Fascist concentration camps, Hu Feng sinisterly praised the kind of "whip that beats prisoners with rubber-covered steel wire, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface," considering it a "good method." During the Anti-Japanese War in Chongqing, the reactionary Kuomintang rulers used all kinds of bloody and brutal means to persecute Communists and progressives; the "powerful," "masters," "politicians," and "maggots" in the people's minds were precisely this gang of Kuomintang bandits and villains; yet Hu Feng aimed such insulting terms, his curses, and hatred at these comrades who were pursuing progress and engaging in revolution.
    What does Hu Feng support? What does he oppose? What is Hu Feng's position? It is more than clear here.
    The two articles published in the "People's Daily" demonstrate Hu Feng's utter hypocrisy. Hu Feng hypocritically wanted to use the principle of "writing truthfully" as a guise for his erroneous theories, but these two things of his own show that he himself is the most untruthful. Not to mention being a glorious writer, an "engineer of the human soul," even in terms of the basic morality of an ordinary person, "consistency between words and deeds," it can be said that Hu Feng does not even have this bit of "humanity."
    I think it is not enough to understand Hu Feng only from the perspective of "ideological errors." For more than twenty years, Hu Feng has appeared as a progressive writer, but judging from Hu Feng's essence, it should not be unfair to add the word "reactionary" to his name. For more than twenty years, our Party and people have united with him, trusted him, and even elected him as a representative of the National People's Congress after liberation; but judging from his actual actions, has he shown even a little bit of importance to this trust and respect; instead, he has opposed the Party, the people, and socialism with such great hatred and hostility!
    Hu Feng's incident has educated many of us: the road to building socialism is by no means smooth, and we should always be vigilant against the enemy's attacks.

　　胡风的嘴脸
　　吴祖光
    许多报纸和杂志展开对胡风的错误思想的批判以来，胡风的反党反人民反社会主义的思想本质已经逐步地暴露出来了。在这一段时期里，我们已经听到过许多发言讨论，读过了许多文章；但是没有再比五月十三日的“人民日报”同时发表胡风的
  “我的自我批判”和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”那样使我们从对照中更清楚地认识胡风丑恶阴险的内心和虚伪的嘴脸了。实际上，舒芜那篇文章的主要内容就是胡风自己写的。他的“自我批判”只是在脸上拿来装饰门面的东西，而他写给舒芜的这些密信，才是他的思想本质和实际行动。
    今天在文艺界积极地工作着的同志们有不少在抗战时期曾同胡风一同住在重庆。我们都还记得很清楚，在国民党反动统治的黑暗恐怖的那一段时期里，大家是多么紧密地团结在共产党的周围，把党和人民革命作为我们的光明和希望。我们曾经用种种不同的方式和敌人作斗争，谁也明白，纪念屈原，纪念鲁迅，纪念五四……这一些活动，对于广大的倾向光明的人民说来，这就是革命的号召和启发。胡风自己也是一向都参加着这些活动的，但是在他的这些密信中，他却把这些活动加上多么恶毒的一些诅咒：人们沉痛地纪念着的被蒋匪暗杀的闻一多先生，胡风却说他是“投机，……投中了”；在人们纪念伟大的鲁迅先生逝世九周年的时候，胡风讥讽地说“纪念死人”是他的“灾难”；在人们一听到法西斯集中营里的那些残酷非刑便会怵目惊心的时候，胡风却狰狞地诵扬着那种“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”，认为是“好方法”。抗战时期的重庆，反动的国民党统治者用尽血腥残暴的手段来迫害共产党人和追求进步的人士；人民心目中的“权贵”、“老爷”、
  “政客”、“蛆虫”，正是这一帮国民党的匪徒恶棍；而胡风却把这样的一些轻侮的名词，把他的诅咒和仇恨对准这些追求进步从事革命的同志们。
    胡风拥护什么？反对什么？什么是胡风的立场？在这里表现得是再明确也没有了。
      “人民日报”上发表的两篇文章，说明了胡风十足的虚伪。胡风虚伪地想用“写真实”的原则来做自己的错误理论的幌子，但是从他自己的这两篇东西里说明了他自己正是最不真实的。不要说是作为“人类灵魂的工程师”的光荣的作家，即是作为一个普通人的基本道德的“表里如一”，胡风也可以说是连这一点“人味”都没有。
    只从“思想上的错误”来理解胡风，我想是不够的了。二十几年来胡风都是以进步作家的面目出现的，但是从胡风的本质看来，我们把“反动的”字样加在他的名字上应该不是不公平的了。二十多年来我们的党和人民这样地团结他信任他，解放以后并且选举他作了全国人民代表大会的代表；但从他的实际行动看来，他何尝有半点重视这些信任和尊敬；而是以多大的仇恨和敌视来反对党，反对人民和反对社会主义！
    胡风的事件教育了我们许多人：建设社会主义的道路，决不是平坦的，我们随时都应该警惕敌人的进攻。
