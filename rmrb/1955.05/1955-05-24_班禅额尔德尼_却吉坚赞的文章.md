　　May 23rd is the fourth anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. From this day on, our Tibetan people have been forever freed from the enslavement and bondage of imperialism, returned to the People's Republic of China—a free and equal family of nationalities, and like other fraternal nationalities, fully enjoy the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and have embarked on a bright and happy path. The arrival of this day of great historical significance is not only celebrated by our Tibetan people with unparalleled excitement and joy, but also by the people of all fraternal nationalities throughout the country, who are elated for this festival.
　　In the past four years, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the support of all fraternal nationalities throughout the country, and especially with the full assistance of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet and all its staff, our Tibetan nationality has made great progress in all aspects. The People's Liberation Army in Tibet and all its staff have unswervingly implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's national and religious policies, implemented the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, earnestly respected the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, and with a positive, responsible, and hardworking spirit, helped our Tibetan region to carry out various constructions. People's Banks and trade companies were established, agricultural experiment farms were set up, and interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans, water conservancy loans, low-interest industrial and commercial loans, and disaster relief were distributed, thereby developing Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce. Postal and telecommunications agencies were established, providing our Tibetan people with communication conveniences. The construction of the Liberation New Village has resettled many displaced and homeless poor people. People's hospitals were established and mobile medical teams were constantly dispatched to rural and pastoral areas for free treatment, reducing the suffering of the broad masses of Tibetan people from diseases. Primary schools were founded, giving Tibetan children the opportunity to study. The People's Liberation Army and all its staff also personally reclaimed wasteland and helped us build bridges and roads. Their high degree of patriotism and the benefits they have given to the Tibetan people have made us deeply realize that the care of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the Tibetan people is meticulous. The Communist Party is the sun for all our nationalities and also for our Tibetan people, and Chairman Mao is the savior of all our nationalities and also of our Tibetan people.
　　At the end of last year, the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway were successfully opened to traffic in Lhasa, which is a great happy event that our Tibetan people have dreamed of for generations and has become a reality today. In the past, it took two or three months to ride livestock from Xining to Lhasa, but now it only takes about half a month by car. It can be seen that the opening of these two highways has made the connection between the Tibetan people and the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland even closer. In March of this year, the announcement by the State Council of the decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and to assist in the construction of Tibet has laid a solid foundation for the construction of a new Tibet and further strengthened the unity between nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality. We firmly believe that with the implementation of the various decisions of the State Council, Tibet will have new developments in the economic and cultural fields in the future. Due to the meticulous care of the central government and the fraternal nationalities, Tibet will continue to be helped to gradually change the past poverty and backwardness, and gradually embark on a prosperous and happy life. Today, in addition to warmly celebrating this festival of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, and thank the State Council and the People's Liberation Army in Tibet and all the staff for their sincere help. Taking this opportunity, we would like to pay our respects to the people of all fraternal nationalities.
　　Last year, Dalai Lama and I attended the First Session of the National People's Congress. From the southwestern border of the motherland, we went to the great capital—Beijing, and had the honor of participating in the National Day observation ceremony for the fifth anniversary of the founding of New China. Later, we participated in the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Before and after these two meetings, we had the opportunity to visit major cities across the country. We personally saw the tremendous achievements made by New China in politics, economy, and culture in the past five years. This visit was completed under the cordial care of the central government and Chairman Mao, as well as the enthusiastic help of various regions. Therefore, it made us more deeply appreciate the loveliness and warmth of the motherland's big family. During this visit, we clearly saw that the people of all nationalities have become the masters of the country. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is a vivid example. People all over the country are confidently working hard on the vast land, in factories, and mines for a happy and better life. We personally saw the new, large-scale factories and mines that have been or are being built all over the country. They are all carrying out a large amount of production for the construction of socialism, and are continuing to improve and expand construction achievements on the basis of victory. We also personally saw our country's powerful army, air force, and navy. We firmly believe that our people's armed forces are fully capable of defending the security of our country's territory, liberating Taiwan, and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
　　Commemorating the fourth anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we must resolutely continue to advance under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao, to further consolidate and strengthen the unity of all nationalities and within nationalities, consolidate and strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces of the Tibetan people, abide by the Constitution, implement the agreement, and strive to do a good job in the preparatory work for the Tibet Autonomous Region, to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and to consolidate the southwestern national defense of the motherland.

    五月二十三日是西藏获得和平解放四周年纪念日。从这天起，我们西藏民族永远摆脱了帝国主义的奴役和羁绊，回到了中华人民共和国——自由平等的民族大家庭，和其他各兄弟民族一样充分享受着民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利，开始走上了光明幸福的大道。这个具有伟大历史意义节日的来临，不仅我们藏族人民以无比兴奋和愉快的心情来庆贺，全国各个兄弟民族的人民也都为着这个节日而欢欣鼓舞。
    四年来，我们西藏民族在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在全国各兄弟民族的支援下，特别是在进藏人民解放军和全体工作人员的全力帮助下，各方面都有很大的进步。进藏人民解放军和全体工作人员，始终坚持不渝地执行了伟大领袖毛主席的民族政策和宗教政策，执行了和平解放西藏办法的协议，认真地尊重了藏族人民的风俗习惯，并以积极负责吃苦耐劳的精神，帮助我们西藏地区进行各项建设。设立了人民银行、贸易公司，举办了农业试验场，发放了无利息的农牧业贷款、水利贷款、工商业低利贷款和灾民救济，从而使西藏的农牧工商业都有了发展。设立了邮电机构，使我们藏族人民得到了通讯的便利。兴建了解放新村使很多流离失所无家可归的贫民得到了安置。设立了人民医院并不断派出巡回医疗队到农村牧场免费治疗，使广大藏族人民减少了疾病痛苦。创办了小学，使藏族儿童得到了学习机会。人民解放军和全体工作人员还亲自开荒生产，帮助我们修桥筑路。他们这种高度的爱国主义精神和给予藏族人民的好处，使我们深刻认识到中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民解放军对西藏人民的关怀是无微不至的。共产党是我们各族人民也是我们藏族人民的太阳，毛主席是我们各族人民也是我们藏族人民的救星。
    去年年底，康藏公路、青藏公路胜利通车拉萨，这是我们藏族人民世世代代所梦想不到而在今天已成为事实的大喜事。过去由西宁到拉萨骑牲口走需要两、三个月，现在坐汽车只要半月左右，可见这两条公路的通车，使藏族人民和祖国各兄弟民族人民的联系更加紧密了。今年三月间，国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会和帮助西藏建设等项决定的公布，更奠定了建设新西藏的强固基础，进一步加强了民族之间和西藏民族的内部团结。我们深信：随着国务院各项决定的实施，今后的西藏，在经济和文化等方面，一定会有新的发展，由于中央和各兄弟民族的关怀备至，将不断帮助西藏人民逐步地改变过去的穷困和落后的面貌，逐渐走上繁荣幸福的生活。今天，我们除热烈祝贺这个和平解放西藏的节日外，并衷心的感激中国共产党和各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席，感谢国务院和进藏人民解放军以及全体工作人员的热诚帮助，趁此机会，特向各兄弟民族人民致以敬意。
    去年我和达赖喇嘛出席全国人民代表大会第一次会议，从祖国西南边疆到了伟大首都——北京，荣幸的参加了新中国成立五周年国庆观礼，以后又参加了中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，在这两次会议前后获得机会到全国各大城市进行参观，我们亲眼看到了新中国成立五年来，在政治、经济和文化上所取得的巨大成就。这次参观，是在中央和毛主席的亲切关怀以及各个地区热情帮助下完成的，因而，使我们更深刻的体会到祖国大家庭的可爱和温暖。在这次参观中，我们清楚地看到了各族人民都已成了国家的主人，延边朝鲜族自治区就是一个鲜明的例子。全国各地人民正满怀信心地为着幸福美好的生活，在广阔的土地上，在工厂、矿山进行着愉快的劳动，我们亲眼看到全国各地已经或正在兴建新型的规模宏大的厂矿，他们都为建设社会主义进行着大量的生产，并正在胜利的基础上继续改进和扩大建设成就。我们还亲自看到了我们祖国强大的陆军和空、海军，我们深信，我们人民的武装部队完全有力量保卫我们祖国领土的安全，解放台湾，维护亚洲与世界的和平。
    纪念和平解放西藏四周年，我们一定要坚决的在毛主席的胜利旗帜下继续前进，为进一步巩固和加强各民族和民族内部的团结，巩固和加强西藏人民反帝爱国的力量，遵守宪法，执行协议，为做好西藏自治区的筹备工作，为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏，巩固祖国西南国防而奋斗。　（新华社）
