Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. According to a United Press report, the United States has suggested stationing a division of American troops in Taiwan. The news says that this suggestion was put forward by Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson during their recent activities in Taiwan. At the same time, the United States is also considering other possibilities, such as increasing military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The news says that the purpose of the United States is to "reassure" the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique of the American intention to "defend" Taiwan, in order to support the "morale" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This exposes that behind the smoke screen of a "ceasefire," the United States is stepping up its military occupation of Taiwan.

Recently, the commander of the U.S. 315th Air Transport Division, Waldron, visited Taiwan and discussed with the Taiwan-US Chiang authorities the issue of his troops airlifting supplies for the recently established Taiwan Liaison Center. In addition, it has been announced that the number of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan is being greatly increased. The Bank of Taiwan has been asked to prepare another 200 houses for American military personnel and their families.

　　美国要派一师美军占据台湾
　　新华社二日讯　据合众社报道，美国已经建议在台湾驻扎一个师的美国军队。消息说，这种建议是美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福和助理国务卿罗伯逊最近到台湾活动时提出的。同时，美国现在还在考虑增加对蒋贼的军事援助等其他可能性。消息说，美国的目的是要向蒋介石卖国集团“重新保证”美国“保卫”台湾的意图，以支持蒋介石卖国集团的“士气”。这就暴露出美国在“停火”的烟幕后面，正在加紧对台湾的军事侵占。
    日前，美国第三百十五空运师师长华尔德朗到过台湾，同台湾的美蒋当局讨论他的部队为最近建立的台湾联络中心空运供应品的问题。此外，据宣布，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的人数正在大大增加中。台湾银行已被要求为美国军事人员和眷属再预备二百幢房屋。
