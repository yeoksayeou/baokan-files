　　State-owned Stock Farms on the Hulunbuir Grassland
　　By our correspondent Lin Mo
    The Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia is one of China's excellent natural pastures. Thirty-four state-owned stock farms have now been established on this grassland with abundant water and grass, thirty-one of which were established in the last ten months. There are currently more than 300 animal husbandry veterinarians and various technical and management personnel, and more than 1,600 workers working on state-owned stock farms. These state-owned stock farms have more than 13,000 head of fine hybrid cattle (Sanhe cattle), more than 4,000 fine hybrid horses (Sanhe horses), more than 600 Mongolian horses, and more than 5,000 local sheep.
    These fine hybrid cattle and horses on state-owned stock farms are improved varieties developed from foreign fine breeds and local livestock through years of crossbreeding. This kind of livestock has very high production performance. For example, a good dairy cow can produce more than 20 kilograms of milk a day; fine breed horses run fast and have great pulling power. Moreover, they are not afraid of the cold and are very suitable for development and reproduction on the Inner Mongolia grassland.
    The local party and government organs have initially determined the development scale and speed of these state-owned stock farms in accordance with instructions from higher authorities. It is estimated that within five years, the total number of fine hybrid cattle will reach more than 28,300 (including more than 14,000 sold), the total number of fine hybrid horses will reach 10,000 (including 1,500 sold), and the total number of Mongolian horses will increase to more than 1,180 (selling more than 400). The number of local black-wool sheep will be maintained at 5,000 each year, and it is planned to sell more than 8,400 in five years. It has also been decided that state-owned stock farms will develop 10,000 hectares of feed base in five years and plant a large amount of refined feed and succulent feed. The six tractors currently allocated by the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee have begun to reclaim wasteland. More than 70 animal husbandry and veterinary staff members dispatched by the Ministry of Agriculture and Changchun, Harbin and other places and various leagues of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have begun working in the stock farms.

　　呼伦贝尔草原上的国营牧场
　　本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原是我国优良的天然牧场之一，在这个水草丰美的草原上，现已建立了三十四个国营牧场，其中三十一处是在最近十个月中建立的。在国营牧场工作的现有畜牧兽医及各种技术人员和管理人员三百多名，工人一千六百多名。这些国营牧场共有优良杂种牛（三河牛）一万三千多头，优良杂种马（三河马）四千多匹，另有蒙古马六百多匹，本地羊五千多只。
    国营牧场的这些优良杂种牛和马，都是由外来良种和本地牲畜经过多年的杂交培育而成的改良品种。这种牲畜生产性能很高，如一头较好的乳牛，一天可产二十多公斤奶；良种马跑得快，拉车挽力也很大。而且不怕寒冷，很适合于在内蒙古草原上发展繁殖。
    当地党政机关已根据上级指示，初步确定了这些国营牧场的发展规模和速度。预计五年内优良杂种牛的总头数将达到二万八千三百多头（内出售一万四千多头），优良杂种马的总数达到一万匹（内出售一千五百匹），蒙古马的总数发展到一千一百八十多匹（出售四百多匹）。本地黑毛绵羊每年保持五千只，五年中计划出售八千四百多只。并决定国营牧场在五年中开辟一万公顷饲料基地，大量种植精料和多汁饲料。现由内蒙古自治区人民委员会农牧部拨给的六台拖拉机已开始进行开荒。农业部和长春、哈尔滨等地及内蒙古自治区各盟派来的七十多名畜牧兽医工作人员，已开始在牧场中进行工作。
