Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: According to TASS, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told a "Spark" magazine reporter that he was very interested in preparing to visit the Soviet Union, meeting the Soviet people, and seeing everything that your country has accomplished in the period since I visited about twenty-eight years ago. I am coming to your country to learn, because I firmly believe that, in addition to the common policies we already have in developing friendly relations with all countries, India can learn a lot from the Soviet Union that will be beneficial to us.
    I believe that the people of our two countries can benefit from friendly relations and mutual trust.

　　尼赫鲁总理就访问苏联向记者发表谈话
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社讯：印度总理尼赫鲁向“星火”杂志记者发表谈话说，我极感兴趣地准备访问苏联，准备会见苏联人民，以及看到你们的国家在大约二十八年前我到过以后的这段时间内所完成的一切事情。我到贵国是去学习的，因为我深信，除了在同各国人民发展友好关系方面我们已有共同的政策以外，印度还能够向苏联学习到很多对我们有益的东西。
    我相信，我们两国人民能够从友好关系和彼此信任中得到好处。
