Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th - According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 20th: People from all parts of Vietnam have sent more than 152,000 petitions and accusations to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, condemning the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to forcibly migrate residents of North Vietnam. These letters do not include the accusations that people from various regions directly submitted to the mobile inspection teams of the International Commission.

These accusations presented many specific pieces of evidence of the forced migration activities of the U.S. imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Tran Quang Trung, a resident of Thanh Hoa province, revealed in his accusation the fact that two agents directed by the United States intimidated his aunt to migrate south. Pham Van Tac, a resident of Nam Dinh province, accused in his letter that an agent threatened to kill him if he did not migrate south.

Some of the accusations were written by residents who were forced to migrate south and then fled back to the north.

　　越南各地人民送给国际委员会十五万多封控诉书
　　谴责美国和吴庭艳集团强迫北越居民迁移
    新华社河内二十日电　据越南通讯社二十日讯：越南各地人民已经送给越南国际监督和监察委员会十五万二千封以上的请愿书和控诉书，谴责美帝国主义者和吴庭艳集团强迫北越居民迁移的阴谋。在这些信中，还不包括各地人民直接交给国际委员会各机动视察小组的控诉书在内。
    这些控诉书中提出美帝国主义者和吴庭艳集团强迫迁移活动的许多具体证据。清化省居民陈光中在控诉书中揭露了美国指挥的两个特务分子恐吓他的姑母南迁的事实。南定省居民范文则在信中控诉，一个特务分子威胁他如果不南迁就要杀死他。
    有一些控诉书是被强迫南迁的居民逃回北部后写的。
