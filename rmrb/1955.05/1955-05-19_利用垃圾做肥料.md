　　Utilizing Garbage to Make Fertilizer
　　Gui Chengduo
    Chengdu, Sichuan Province, is a large city. The entire city produces hundreds of thousands of pounds of night soil daily, which is one of the main fertilizer sources for nearby farmland. After the Chengdu Fertilizer Company was established in 1952, it took over the unified management of the city's night soil. With the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperative movement and the requirements for increased agricultural production, the city's night soil supply became insufficient every spring plowing season. Many farmers waited outside the supply and marketing cooperative in the middle of the night, waiting to purchase "fertilizer (night soil) pick-up slips"; however, during the agricultural off-season, the city's night soil accumulated in large quantities. The sewage from many toilets overflowed, and some residents even poured night soil into sewers and rivers, affecting the city's sanitation.
    To solve this problem, the Chengdu Fertilizer Company, together with relevant departments, conducted several studies and decided to adopt advanced Soviet experience, mixing night soil and garbage to make the garbage rot and ferment into granular fertilizer. This would provide an outlet for the city's night soil during the off-season.
    In April 1953, the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Science Institute began research work on using garbage and night soil to manufacture granular fertilizer. Preliminary tests proved that this granular fertilizer had a very good effect on fertilizing fields. Land where granular fertilizer was applied saw increased yields. According to a survey of sixteen farming households in Huayang, Xindu, Renshou, and other counties that used granular fertilizer last year: eight households saw an increase in yield of winter crops of 25 percent; four households saw an increase of 25 to 50 percent; and four households saw an increase of more than 50 percent. Farmers generally reflected that the fertilizer effect was fast, long-lasting, resilient, and inexpensive.
    The demand for granular fertilizer from farmers across the province is increasing. In the past two years, the Chengdu Fertilizer Company has established three manual granular fertilizer plants on suburban garbage dumps. Last year, it manufactured more than 3,000 tons of fertilizer. This year, the planned production of granular fertilizer will increase 5.6 times compared to last year. The number of workers has increased from more than 100 in the past to more than 330. There are also plans to transform the original two manual granular fertilizer plants into granular fertilizer plants that use machinery for production.
    Since garbage became the basic raw material for manufacturing fertilizer, more than 400,000 pounds of garbage per day throughout the city and the city's night soil during agricultural off-seasons have basically been rationally treated.
    The success of the Chengdu Fertilizer Company in using garbage and night soil to manufacture granular fertilizer has attracted the attention of agricultural, forestry, cooperative, and health departments in Sichuan Province and across the country. Last June, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, together with the Chengdu Fertilizer Company and the Agricultural Science Institute, held a granular fertilizer training class, and workers and cadres from fifteen counties and cities across the province came to study. Last year, Wanxian, Luzhou, and Zigong cities began producing granular fertilizer. This year, Jiangjin, Neijiang, Suining, Santai, Yibin, and twelve other counties and cities will also produce granular fertilizer. Many cities in Shanxi, Shanghai, Anhui, Xikang, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and other places have also sent people to learn from the experience or wrote letters requesting information on manufacturing granular fertilizer.

    Editor's Note: Chengdu's manufacture of granular fertilizer has solved the problem of night soil supply during the off-season and peak season, which is very good. However, all localities must utilize garbage and night soil most economically based on specific conditions and cannot mechanically apply this method. In northern provinces, where garbage contains more coal and less organic matter, whether granular fertilizer can be manufactured also requires specific research.

### 利用垃圾做肥料

　　利用垃圾做肥料
　　桂承铎
    四川省成都市是一个较大的城市，全城每天有几十万斤粪便，这些粪便是附近农田肥料的主要来源之一。一九五二年成都市肥料公司成立后，统一管理了全城粪便。随着农村互助合作运动的发展和农业增产的要求，每到春耕季节，城市粪便就不够供应了。许多农民半夜守在供销合作社门口，等待购买“肥料（粪便）提货单”；但是，每到农闲季节，城市粪便又大量积压，许多厕所的粪水都漫了出来，有的居民甚至把粪便倒进阴沟和河里，影响城市卫生。
    为了解决这个问题，成都市肥料公司曾和有关部门进行了多次研究，决定采用苏联先进经验，把粪便和垃圾混合，使垃圾腐烂发酵后制成颗粒肥料，这就可以给淡季城市粪便找到出路。
    一九五三年四月，四川省农业科学研究所开始进行利用垃圾粪便制造颗粒肥料的研究工作。初步试验证明，这种颗粒肥料肥田的效果很好。施用颗粒肥料的土地都能增加产量。根据华阳、新都、仁寿等县去年施用颗粒肥料的十六个农户中的调查：小春作物增产百分之二十五的有八户；增产百分之二十五到五十的有四户；增产百分之五十以上的有四户。农民一般反映：肥效来得快，管得久，熬劲大，价钱便宜。
    全省农民对颗粒肥料的需要量越来越大。成都市肥料公司在过去两年中，已在城郊垃圾场上建立了三个手工颗粒肥料场，去年制造了三千多吨肥料，今年颗粒肥料的计划产量将比去年提高五点六倍。工人由过去一百多人增加到三百三十多人，还准备把原有两个手工颗粒肥料场改变为使用机器生产的颗粒肥料场。
    自从垃圾成为制造肥料的基本原料后，全市每天四十多万斤垃圾和农闲时间城市的粪便基本上得到了合理的处理。
    成都市肥料公司利用垃圾和粪便制造颗粒肥料成功，引起四川省和全国各地农林、合作、卫生等部门的重视。去年六月间，省供销合作社会同成都市肥料公司、农业科学研究所举办了粒肥训练班，全省有十五个县市的工人和干部前来学习。去年，万县、泸州、自贡三市已开始生产颗粒肥料。今年，又有江津、内江、遂宁、三台、宜宾等十二个县市将生产颗粒肥料。山西、上海、安徽、西康、浙江、贵州等地许多城市也都先后派人去学习经验，或写信索取制造颗粒肥料的资料。
    编者按：成都市制造颗粒肥料，解决了淡季和旺季粪便供应问题，这是很好的。但各地必须根据具体条件最经济地利用垃圾和粪便，不能机械搬用。北方各省垃圾中煤炭多，有机质少，是不是能够制造颗粒肥料，也须具体研究。
