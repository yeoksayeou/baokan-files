To the Editor:

　　The sanitation situation at the Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant is very poor. Near the workshops, there are piles of bricks, tiles, scrap iron, waste copper, and garbage. The ceilings of the changing rooms are covered in cobwebs; under the lockers are piles of worn-out shoes and dirty socks, and dirty items are stored together with food inside the lockers. In some workshops, the drainage ditches are full of muddy water, and the glass is so dirty that people cannot be seen through it. This situation seriously affects the health and production of the workers. According to the statistics from the plant's health station, the number of sick leave requests in March of this year increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year. From March 21st to April 10th, 308 people took sick leave, resulting in a total loss of 3,308 workdays.

　　The leadership of the Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant emphasizes the urgency of production tasks and claims that there is no time for sanitation work. They set sanitation work in opposition to production. Almost a month after the directives from the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee and the Tianjin Railway Bureau regarding the implementation of spring sanitation work were issued, they only allowed workers in each workshop to conduct a single cleanup before and after their shifts on April 15th and 17th, cleaning up conspicuous places like the walkways. In this way, they believed the spring sanitation campaign had been launched and reported this to the Municipal People's Committee. In fact, some workshops did not carry out any sanitation work at all after receiving the plan. The director of the locomotive workshop, after receiving the plan, believed that the production tasks were urgent and that there were too many meetings, leaving no time for sanitation work. He handed the plan over to the workshop's union chairman to handle. The workshop's union chairman also emphasized that there was no time to study the plan, so he simply put it away. We believe this situation is not good, and the Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant should find ways to improve the sanitation work in the factory.

　　唐山机车车辆修理厂应该重视卫生工作编辑同志：
    唐山机车车辆修理厂的卫生情况很不好。在各车间附近积着砖头瓦块、废铁、烂铜和垃圾；更衣室的顶棚上布满了蛛网；衣柜底下堆着破鞋、脏袜，衣柜里的脏东西和食物放在一起。有的车间地沟里都是污泥水，玻璃脏的里外看不见人。这种状况严重地影响了工人的身体健康和生产。据这个厂的保健站统计，今年三月份比去年同时期请假的病人增加了百分之七十多，三月二十一日到四月十日就有三百零八人请病假，共计损失了三千三百零八个工作日。
    唐山机车车辆修理厂领导方面，强调生产任务紧，没有时间搞卫生工作。他们把卫生工作和生产对立起来。唐山市人民委员会和天津铁路管理局关于开展春季卫生工作的指示下达将近一个月，他们才在四月十五日和十七日让各车间职工在班前班后进行一次扫除，把甬路等显眼的地方打扫了一下，这样，他们认为春季卫生运动已经开展起来了，就向市人民委员会作了报告。事实上，有些车间接到计划以后根本就没有进行过卫生工作。机车车间主任在接到计划后认为生产任务紧，会议多，没有时间搞卫生工作，就把计划交给车间工会主席办理。车间工会主席也强调没有时间研究就把计划存放起来了。我们觉得这种情况是不好的，唐山机车车辆修理厂应该设法改进工厂里的卫生工作。　耿敏　曾皋
