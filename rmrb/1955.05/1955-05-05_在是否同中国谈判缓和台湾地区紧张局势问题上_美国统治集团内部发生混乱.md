Xinhua News Agency, May 4th, Washington dispatch: Following Premier Zhou Enlai's statement at the Bandung Asian-African Conference that the Chinese government is prepared to negotiate with the US government to ease tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area, the pronouncements of several representatives of the US ruling circles on the question of whether or not to negotiate with China have shown obvious confusion.

As previously reported, the initial statement issued by the US State Department, by proposing unreasonable preconditions, flatly refused to negotiate with China. This attitude created a very unfavorable impression of the US ruling circles both abroad and at home. The Chicago "Daily News" reporter, in a dispatch from Bandung at that time, said that the US State Department's statement was considered "stupid, ill-tempered, and untimely" by the participants of the Asian-African Conference, "leaving almost everyone with a disgusting impression."

The "New York Post" editorial on April 25th considered the US State Department's statement to be "brusque" and a wet blanket. The editorial said, "In the face of the excitement of the whole world, our (American) wet blanket forces acted hastily." "The State Department has once again put on its oldest record... This constant emphasis on 'conditions' for negotiations has convinced many people in the world that we only want to delay the negotiations." The editorial believed that the US State Department's statement had reached "the point of inviting evil consequences."

Therefore, US Secretary of State Dulles and President Eisenhower successively made speeches at press conferences on April 26th and 27th, attempting to eliminate this very unfavorable impression of the US ruling circles. They expressed their willingness to negotiate so-called "ceasefire" with China. The "Christian Science Monitor" published an article on the 27th, explaining that this kind of talk was actually "not initiating a new policy," but "a policy that has been in place for some time." The article pointed out that the "ceasefire" talkers "are not interested in a formal solution," but want to maintain the "status quo." That is to say, to maintain the "status quo" of the US occupying Taiwan and prevent China from liberating Taiwan.

After Dulles and Eisenhower's talks, even Dulles's "negotiation" rhetoric was unacceptable to some of the most blatant warmongers in the US ruling circles. Just hours after Eisenhower held a press conference, US Senate Republican Leader Knowland issued a statement advocating a firm refusal to negotiate with China. Republican Senator Jenner also submitted a proposal to the Senate on the 28th, stipulating that US government officials be prohibited from participating in negotiations. Jenner spoke in the Senate on the same day, clamoring that the United States must not only "defend" Taiwan, but also "help defend" Jinmen and Mazu.

However, the warmongering clamor of Knowland, Jenner, and their ilk was so unpopular that many American politicians were unwilling to respond. According to a United Press International report, "even those who had previously been most supportive of them are now paying almost no attention to their words." On April 30th, twelve Republican senators, including Alexander Smith, issued a statement supporting Eisenhower's approach. A United Press International report said that this "statement was seen as a direct response to the criticism of the President's policy by Senate Republican Leader Knowland and Republican Senator Jenner."

Recently, many American newspapers have been talking about the reasons why Eisenhower and Dulles had to "revise" the State Department's initial statement and adopt the current approach. The "New York Herald Tribune" said on May 1st that "very powerful tactical considerations" were: "Most of America's Asian and European allies attach great importance to diplomatic conferences as a way to reduce the burden of armaments and ease the tensions of this divided world." The Washington correspondent of the "New York Daily News" talked about the domestic factors considered by the US ruling circles. The reporter said that the actions of the White House, Congress, and both the Democratic and Republican parties must take into account the impact on the votes in next year's presidential election. Eisenhower's closest advisers believe that in order to win the election next year, Eisenhower must use the advocacy of peace as his "trump card" in order to gain the support of voters.

It is worth mentioning that many American newspapers are currently making every effort to publicize the US authorities' expressed willingness to "negotiate" with China. However, a common characteristic of these American newspapers' rhetoric is to avoid talking about the key to easing tensions in the Taiwan area being the withdrawal of the United States' armed intervention forces, while only talking about the United States wanting to negotiate a so-called "ceasefire" with China. Regarding this point, even the United Press International correspondent in Tokyo asked the United Press International headquarters to "clarify" a question: "The United States and Communist China are not at war, how can they talk about a ceasefire?" At the same time, amidst the talk of a so-called "ceasefire," news in American newspapers said that the United States is preparing to send a division of American troops to be stationed in Taiwan, and to increase military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

### 在是否同中国谈判缓和台湾地区紧张局势问题上　美国统治集团内部发生混乱

　　在是否同中国谈判缓和台湾地区紧张局势问题上
　　美国统治集团内部发生混乱
    新华社四日讯　华盛顿消息：在周恩来总理在万隆亚非会议上发表关于中国政府准备同美国政府谈判和缓远东紧张局势、特别是和缓台湾地区紧张局势的声明以后，美国统治集团内部若干代表人物关于是否同中国谈判的问题的言论呈现了明显的混乱。
    前已报道，美国国务院最初发表的声明，用提出无理的先决条件的办法，断然拒绝同中国谈判。这种态度在美国国外和国内造成了对美国统治集团十分不利的印象。芝加哥“每日新闻”记者那时自万隆发回的报道说，美国国务院的声明被亚非会议的参加者们认为是“愚蠢的、性情坏的和不合时宜的”，“给差不多每个人留下了一种令人厌恶的印象”。
      “纽约邮报”四月二十五日的社论认为，美国国务院的声明是“生硬的”，是在泼冷水。社论说，
  “在整个世界的激动情绪面前，我们（美国）的冷水部队仓匆地采取了行动。”“国务院又一次放上了它最老的留声片，……这种不停地强调谈判‘条件’的做法已经使世界上许多人相信我们仅想推迟谈判的时间。”社论认为美国国务院的声明是到达了“招致恶果的地步”。
    于是，美国国务卿杜勒斯和总统艾森豪威尔接连在四月二十六日和二十七日在记者招待会上发表谈话，力图消除这种对美国统治集团十分不利的印象。他们表示要同中国谈判所谓“停火”。“基督教科学箴言报”二十七日刊载的一篇文章解释说，这种谈论实际上并“不是发动一个新政策”，而是
  “一个行之已有一些时候的政策”。这篇文章指出，“停火”谈论者“感觉兴趣的不是一个正式的解决”，而是要维持“现状”。这也就是说，要维持美国霸占台湾的“现状”，要中国不去解放台湾。
    在杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的谈话以后，美国统治集团里一些最露骨的好战分子连杜勒斯这样的“谈判”论调也不愿意听到。就在艾森豪威尔举行记者招待会以后几小时，美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰发表了一个声明，主张断然拒绝同中国谈判。共和党参议员真纳二十八日也向参议院提出一项提案，其中规定禁止美国政府官员参加谈判。真纳同一天在参议院发言，叫嚷美国必须不仅“保卫”台湾，而且要“帮助防守”金门和马祖。
    然而，诺兰、真纳之流的好战叫嚷是如此不得人心，以致许多美国政治人物不愿意响应。合众社消息说，“连以前一直对他们支持最力的人现在对他们的话几乎也不加理睬”。四月三十日，亚历山大·史密斯等十二个共和党参议员发表声明，支持艾森豪威尔的做法。合众社消息说，这个“声明被认为是对参议院共和党领袖诺兰和共和党参议员真纳对总统的政策的抨击的直接回答”。
    近来许多美国报纸谈论着艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯不得不“修正”国务院最初的声明而采取目前做法的原因。“纽约先驱论坛报”五月一日说，“很有力的战术考虑”是：“美国的大多数亚洲和欧洲的盟国，极为重视作为减轻军备负担和缓和这个分裂的世界的紧张局势的方法的外交会议”。“纽约每日新闻”驻华盛顿记者则谈到美国统治集团所考虑的国内因素。该记者说，白宫、国会和民主党、共和党方面的行动都要考虑到对明年选举总统时的选票的影响。艾森豪威尔的最亲近的顾问认为，为要在明年选举中获胜，艾森豪威尔要以主张和平为“王牌”，这样才能得到选民的支持。
    值得提出的是目前许多美国报纸正在竭力渲染美国当局所表示的愿意同中国“谈判”的做法，但是，这些美国报纸的言论的共同特点是避而不谈和缓台湾地区紧张局势的关键在美国撤退其武装干涉力量，而只是一味谈论着美国要同中国谈判所谓“停火”。关于这一点，连合众社驻东京记者也要求合众社总社“澄清”一个这样的问题：“美国和共产党中国没有在打仗，怎么能够谈停火？”同时，正当谈论所谓“停火”声中，美国报纸上的消息说，美国正准备派遣一师美国军队到台湾驻扎，并且增加对蒋介石卖国集团的军事援助。
