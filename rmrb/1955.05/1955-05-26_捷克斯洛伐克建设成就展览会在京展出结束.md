　　The Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing concluded on the 25th. Over the past forty-one days, more than 1.25 million people from the capital and across the country visited.

　　During the exhibition, leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, visited the exhibition.

　　The Chinese people were extremely excited to see Czechoslovakia's leap forward in industry and technology. Scientists, professors, and workers from the capital, engineers and technicians from Tianjin, Anshan, Shenyang, Taiyuan, geological survey team members from the State-owned Friendship Farm in the Great Northern Wilderness, and herdsmen from the Qinghai grasslands all wrote enthusiastic inscriptions in the visitors' book.

　　The technical exchange activities held during the exhibition provided many practical assistance to the young Chinese technical community. Experts from various fields sent by the Czechoslovak government answered questions from 530 units across the country regarding machine tools, water and oil pipeline gates, agricultural machinery, musical instruments, automobiles, and other aspects through on-site Q&A sessions, seminars, reports, and factory guidance. More than 30 units in Beijing invited experts to provide on-site guidance, and they humbly learned a lot of advanced experience from the Czechoslovak experts. Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Beijing Metrology Factory, Beijing Timber Factory, Beijing Telephone Bureau's Urban Telephone Office, and other units using Czechoslovak machinery solved many long-standing technical problems with the help of experts.

　　In conjunction with the exhibition and technical exchange activities, eighty Czechoslovak scientific and cultural short films such as "Universal Tool Grinder," "Prefabricated Houses," "Brain Surgery," and "People's Painter Lada" were also screened. Chinese audiences were very interested in these films. The exhibition's dedicated sales area received 610,000 Chinese customers, who purchased various exquisite daily necessities made in Czechoslovakia, including world-renowned musical instruments and glassware.

　　All the exhibits will soon be transported to Shanghai and continue to be exhibited at the Shanghai Soviet Exhibition Hall. Some Czech experts will be invited to visit cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Harbin to continue technical exchange activities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 25th. More than 400 Chinese and Czechoslovak staff members of the Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition held an evening party on the 25th to celebrate the successful conclusion of the exhibition. Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Mr. Grigor, and embassy staff also attended the evening party.

　　At the party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful programs in the open-air theater of the Soviet Exhibition Hall.

    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在北京的展出已于二十五日结束。四十一天来，有首都以及来自全国各地的一百二十五万多人前往参观。
    在展览期间，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导者曾经参观了展览会。
    中国人民怀着极其兴奋的心情看到了捷克斯洛伐克在工业和技术上的飞跃进步。首都的科学家、教授、工人，天津、鞍山、沈阳、太原等地来的工程师和技术人员，来自北大荒的国营友谊农场的地质调查队员，青海草原的牧民，都纷纷在观众留言簿上写下了热情的题词。
    展览期间进行的技术交流活动，给予年轻的中国技术界许多实际的帮助。捷克斯洛伐克政府派来的各方面的专家通过现场解答、座谈会、报告会、下厂指导等方式，解答了全国各地五百三十个单位提出的关于机床、水油管道闸门、农业机械、乐器、汽车等各方面的问题。北京三十多个单位曾邀请专家下厂指导，他们虚心地向捷克斯洛伐克专家学习了许多先进经验。北京第一机床厂、北京度量衡厂、北京木材厂、北京电话局市内电话处等使用捷克斯洛伐克机器的单位，在专家帮助下解决了许多长期不得解决的技术问题。
    配合展览会和技术交流活动，还放映了“万能工具磨床”“预制房屋”“大脑手术”“人民画家拉达”等八十部捷克斯洛伐克科学和文化短片。中国观众对这些影片感到很大的兴趣。展览会专设的售品处接待了六十一万名中国顾客，他们在这里买到了捷克斯洛伐克出品的各种精致的日用品，其中包括驰名世界的乐器和玻璃器皿。
    展览会的全部展品，不久就要运往上海，在上海苏联展览馆继续展出。一部分捷克专家将应邀访问上海、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨等城市，继续展开技术交流活动。
    新华社二十五日讯　捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会中捷双方工作人员四百多人在二十五日晚举行晚会，庆祝展览会胜利闭幕。捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使格里哥尔和使馆人员也参加了晚会。
