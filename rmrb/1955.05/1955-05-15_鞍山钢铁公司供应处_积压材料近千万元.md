Anshan Iron and Steel Company Supply Department

Nearly 10 Million Yuan of Materials Backlogged

Editor Comrade:

    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's supply department has serious problems with material backlog and waste. According to a survey in mid-April, the materials backlogged in the warehouse (including a large amount of special steel, alloy steel pipes, steel wire rope, spring steel wire, mixed copper, and more than one hundred other items), based on current usage, would last for roughly twenty to eighty years or more. Some materials, such as carrying baskets, paintbrushes, wires, cables, V-belts, and transmission belts, have already rusted and deteriorated due to long-term backlog and cannot be used. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of national funds backlogged and wasted amounts to 9.88 million yuan.

    What are the main reasons for this situation? There are four main points:

    First, some units of Anshan Iron and Steel do not conduct investigations and research when reporting material plans, but rely solely on estimation. In particular, some leading cadres have the idea of "rather more than less," believing that having more is always better than having less. Certain leading cadres and plan reviewers in the supply department also fail to analyze and study the plans, and simply hand them over to the procurement section for purchase with the intention of increasing reserves. For example, when the Anshan Iron and Steel Real Estate Department, Welfare Department, Chemical Plant, and Water Supply Plant formulated the 1953 plumbing equipment plan, they simply made an estimate and reported it. When this estimated plan was submitted to the Metal Materials Section of the Supply Department, the section chief, Yu Baoxin (now transferred to the Supply Department's general warehouse), asked the plan reviewer to add a quarter of the reserve amount before handing it over to the procurement section for ordering. As a result, the purchased equipment required eleven train cars to transport. Later, because the warehouse could not accommodate it, it was reduced to seven train cars. To this day, less than a quarter of these plumbing materials have been used.

    Second, some units, when formulating plans, "consider" the "needs" of the distant future and report material preparation plans. For example, the large plant ordered eighty-one ball bearings from abroad in 1953, sixty-one of which have not been used to this day. This item alone accounts for a backlog of more than 180,000 yuan. Some units also write specifications randomly when reporting plans, and the supply department's planners simply copy and forward them. For example, among the cables purchased in 1954, more than forty types were of the wrong specifications, forcing more than 400,000 yuan of state property to "sleep" in the warehouse.

    Third, there is duplication in planning and procurement. For example, for the insulating varnish used by the Electrical Repair Plant, both the chief mechanical engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel and the Electrical Repair Plant submitted a plan, resulting in a backlog of more than 4,500 kilograms. Another example is that when the supply department purchased spring lock washers in 1953, it first ordered them from Shanghai, and then found readily available goods in Shenyang. By the time the goods from Shanghai arrived, they were no longer needed.

    Finally, inspectors are irresponsible and treat defective products as good products. Mistakes are made in the specifications of the materials during inspection. For example, of the one thousand oxygen cylinders purchased at the beginning of this year, none were good after a detailed inspection. At the end of 1954, the three hundred and six grinding wheels inspected by the Supply Department's general warehouse were all of the wrong specifications.

    The above situation reflects the lack of careful calculation and a responsible attitude towards state property on the part of certain leaders and planning staff in various factories and the supply department of Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to better accumulate funds for the country's socialist industrialization, I suggest that the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel should quickly dispose of this batch of backlogged materials and invest the funds in production.

### 鞍山钢铁公司供应处　积压材料近千万元

　　鞍山钢铁公司供应处
　　积压材料近千万元编辑同志：
    鞍山钢铁公司供应处积压和浪费材料严重。据四月中旬的调查，库内积压的材料（有大量的特殊钢材、合金钢管、钢绳、弹簧钢线、杂铜等一百多种）。如果按目前使用情况计算，差不多可以用二十年到八十年以上。有些物资，像抬筐、油刷子、电线、电缆、三角皮带、传动皮带等，由于长年积压已经有一部分生锈变质，不能使用了。据不完全统计，共积压和浪费国家资金达九百八十八万元。
    为什么产生这种情况呢？主要原因有以下四点：
    第一、鞍钢某些单位在上报材料计划时，不进行调查了解，单凭估计；特别是有些领导干部有着
  “宁多勿少”的思想，他们认为多些总比少了强。供应处的某些领导干部和审核计划的工作人员对计划也不加以分析研究，只是在增加储备量的意图下，就交给采购科采购。如鞍钢房产处、福利处、化工总厂、给水厂等单位在制定一九五三年的水暖器材计划时，只是估计一下就向上报告。当这种估计的计划提到供应处金属材料科后，科长于宝信（现转供应处总仓库）又叫审核计划的人加上四分之一的储备量，交给采购科订货去了。结果购进的器材要十一个车皮才能装运。后来因为仓库容纳不了，才削减为七个车皮。这些水暖器材，到现在连四分之一还没用上。
    第二、有些单位在制定计划时“考虑”到很远的将来的“需要”，报上备料计划。如大型厂在一九五三年向国外订购的八十一个滚珠，其中有六十一个至今也用不上，这一项的积压就有十八万多元。也有些单位在报计划时乱写规格，供应处的计划员也照抄照转了事。如一九五四年买来的电缆中，就有四十多种由于规格不合，使国家四十多万元的财产不得不送进仓库“睡觉”。
    第三、计划和采购重复。如电修厂用的绝缘清漆油，鞍钢总机械师和电修厂各报上一份计划，结果积压四千五百多公斤。又如一九五三年供应处采购弹簧螺丝垫时先向上海订了货，后来又在沈阳买到了现货。等到上海的货送来了，已经用不着了。
    最后，验收员工作不负责，将残品当好品。验收的时候弄错了材料规格。如今年年初购进的一千个氧气瓶，验收后，经详细检查没有一个是好的。一九五四年末，供应处总仓库验收的三百零六个砂轮规格都错了。
    以上情况反映了鞍钢各厂和供应处的某些领导人员和计划工作人员缺乏精打细算、对国家财产负责的精神。为了更好地为国家社会主义工业化积累资金，我建议鞍钢的领导上应速处理这批积压的材料，把资金投到生产上去。　杨秉玉
