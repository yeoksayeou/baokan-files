Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th: The "Pravda" correspondent Naumov comments on the deposit of the instruments of ratification of the so-called "Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime (in West Germany)" by Britain and France.

Naumov reports from Bonn that after the deposit of the instruments of ratification, the Federal Parliament did not express the general jubilation that Adenauer had hoped for. Bonn's politicians are well aware that the people are extremely alarmed by the further deepening of the national division due to the realization of West German re-militarization.

Naumov pointed out that while the Adenauer government says that restoring German unity is its top priority, it is doing everything possible to immediately start up the re-militarization machine at full speed after the Paris Accords come into effect. It is known that the Bonn government intends to submit to the Federal Parliament for approval in the short term the bill on recruiting volunteers for the German "Bundeswehr" and other bills aimed at rapidly rebuilding the armed forces. Some people have requested that the re-militarization be slowed down a bit and discussed after exploring the possibility of restoring German unity, but the Adenauer government has not responded to this at all.

All of this cannot but make some politicians uneasy: they believe that the possibility of reaching an agreement on the German question is far from lost. They understand that every new step towards re-militarization will close off another avenue for negotiation.

Naumov concludes by pointing out that if all those who clearly understand how dangerous the Paris Accords are to the interests of the German nation begin to truly guide their actions by the German people's desire for peace and unity, rather than by the delusions of the practitioners of "power politics," then it is not too late to stop the development of the situation.

　　“真理报”发表论文
　　评西方所谓在西德“停止占领制度”的行动
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：“真理报”记者瑙莫夫评论英国和法国交存所谓“（在西德）结束占领制度议定书”的批准书。
    瑙莫夫从波恩报道说，当批准书交存之后，联邦议院并没有表现得像阿登纳所希望的那样普遍狂欢。波恩的政客们十分清楚，人民对由于西德的重新军国主义化的实现而使国家分裂更加加深的情况是十分惊慌不安的。
    瑙莫夫指出，阿登纳政府一面说恢复德国的统一是头等的任务，一面则在尽一切办法，以便在巴黎协定生效之后立刻就全速开动重新军国主义化的机器。大家知道，波恩政府打算在短期内就把关于为德国“国防军”征召志愿兵的法案以及其他一些目的在尽速地重建武装部队的法案提交联邦议院批准。有些人要求使重新军国主义化稍缓一下，在探讨恢复德国统一的可能性以后再说，而阿登纳政府对这一点没有任何答复。
    所有这一切都不能不使这样一些政治家们感到不安：他们认为，就德国问题达成协议的可能性远没有丧尽。他们懂得，每向重新军国主义化走新的一步都会多封闭一条谈判的道路。
    瑙莫夫最后指出，如果凡是明确理解到巴黎协定对德国民族利益多么危险的人士都开始真正地以德国人民对和平和统一的愿望来指导自己的行动，而不是以“实力政策”奉行者的妄想来指导自己的行动的话，那末制止事态的发展还不晚。
