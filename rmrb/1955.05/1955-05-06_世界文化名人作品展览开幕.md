　　World Cultural Figures' Works Exhibition Opens

The exhibition commemorating the works of world cultural figures Schiller, Mickiewicz, Montesquieu, and Andersen opened at the Beijing Library on May 4th.

Nearly two hundred works by these four world cultural figures are on display, in twenty-six different languages. Among them is a precious 1838 German edition of "Schiller's Complete Works," as well as Chinese translations such as "Wallenstein" and a special commemorative publication from 1934 in China honoring Schiller. Among the works of the great Polish poet Mickiewicz, there are Polish and Russian complete works, as well as a facsimile of the manuscript of the third volume of Mickiewicz's "Forefathers' Eve." China's earliest introduction to Mickiewicz, an article written by Lu Xun in 1907 entitled "The Power of the Molo Poems," is also on display here. Regarding Montesquieu's writings, there are old Chinese translations such as "The Spirit of the Laws" published in 1915, and Liang Qichao's book introducing Montesquieu and others, "Four Major Political Theories of Modern Europe."

Among the works of the great Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen is a 1944 Danish edition of "The Emperor's New Clothes," which includes translations in twenty-five languages. Also on display are facsimile copies of Andersen's fairy tale "The Princess's Skin" (i.e., "The Princess and the Pea") and the poem "The Dying Child," recently sent from Denmark.

Some of the works exhibited here were sent by the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Japan for China's commemorative activities. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
