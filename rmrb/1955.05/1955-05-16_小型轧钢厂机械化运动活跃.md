Small steel rolling mill mechanization movement active

    After the small steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company exposed the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen's act of stealing workers' rationalization proposals, the mass movement to improve old equipment through mechanization and automation became active again. Major equipment successfully trial-produced in April included the rolling guide plate for the bright rolling mill and the northern steel turning machine for the rough rolling mill.

    The rolling guide plate for the bright rolling mill was designed by technician Zhang Tianyong and made by worker Chen Lingyan based on suggestions from Soviet expert Vasilyev. This improvement solved the quality problem of rolling 25 to 32 mm round steel in the factory, enabling the overfulfillment of the April production task and creating favorable conditions for completing the annual task. The northern steel turning machine on the rough rolling mill was originally proposed and initially trial-produced by worker Han Changxin in December 1952, but it was not put into production due to the obstruction of the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen. After the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen was exposed, the abandoned northern steel turning machine was actively modified and installed by dozens of people, including workers Han Changxin, Qi Guangyu, and technicians Zhang Weilin and Chi Bo. It was finally successfully trial-produced and put into production on April 28. From then on, the degree of mechanization and automation of the rough rolling mill took another step forward. Workers no longer have to use pliers to turn the steel billets back and forth through the rollers in a high temperature of 1,200 degrees, but only operate on the console by pressing buttons.

　　小型轧钢厂机械化运动活跃
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂在揭发了反党分子康兆文窃取工人合理化建议的行为以后，群众性的改进旧设备的机械化自动化运动又活跃起来了。四月份试制成功的重大设备，有光轧机上的滚动导板和毛轧机上的北部翻钢机等。
    光轧机上的滚动导板是经苏联专家华西列夫提出建议，由技术员张天永设计，工人陈令言制作的。这项改进解决了该厂轧制二十五到三十二公厘圆钢的质量问题，使四月份生产任务超额完成，并为完成全年任务创造了有利条件。毛轧机上的北部翻钢机原来由工人韩长信在一九五二年十二月间提出并初步试制成功，由于反党分子康兆文的阻挠，没有投入生产。反党分子康兆文被揭发以后，被遗弃了的北部翻钢机，又在工人韩长信、齐广余和技术员张渭林、迟波等数十人的积极改制、安装下，在四月二十八日最后试制成功，投入生产。从此，毛轧机的机械化、自动化程度又前进了一步，工人已不必再冒着一千二百度的高温用钳子把钢坯翻来覆去地穿过轧辊，只在操纵台上按电钮进行操纵就行了。  （本报驻鞍山记者）
