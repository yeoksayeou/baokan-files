Why Turn a Blind Eye to the Destructive Activities of Rich Peasants?
　　Jian Hong
　　During the period of socialist transformation of agriculture, there were fierce class struggles in the countryside. Although the number of rich peasants was not large, and they had been weakened during the land reform period, and the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations had further restricted them, the class struggle was not becoming more moderate, but more complex and more acute. However, many comrades doing rural work do not see the struggle between rich peasant elements and working peasants, nor the struggle between rich peasants and the working class. They often look at problems from the perspective of the number of people and superficial phenomena, which is very harmful. With this view, they will lose vigilance against the rich peasants, will not be able to soberly deal with the complex class struggle, will not be able to rely well on the poor peasants and closely unite with the middle peasants, and will cause immeasurable losses to the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

　　I recently learned about two such things in the fifth district of Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province:

　　One is the matter of Songlindian Township. There was a rich peasant named Zhang Rui in this township. During the land reform, because he did not have much land and only hired short-term workers, he was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant. In fact, his main income was the exploitation of usury and grain speculation, and he should have been classified as a rich peasant. Since the implementation of the general line, agricultural producers' cooperatives have developed, and the unified purchase and sale of grain has been implemented, Zhang Rui's exploitative behavior has been greatly restricted. Therefore, he showed particular hatred for the People's Government, cadres, and enlightened peasants. He was afraid that the masses in his township would expose his behavior of carrying out usury exploitation, so he turned open exploitation into hidden exploitation, only lending money to the people he trusted most and the more backward small traders in his village, and transferring most of his money and grain to other villages. His neighbors said: "Before the unified purchase of grain began the year before last, Zhang Rui ran to other villages before dawn every day, secretly converting the grain he had lent out to other villages into money, and did not go home until no one was around at night." He also hired short-term workers from other villages. After the unified purchase of grain began, he resisted and cursed. The masses accused him of his crimes to the county people's government and attached materials showing that he had lent a large amount of grain in other villages. But how did the county people's government deal with this issue? They did not fully consider the opinions of the masses, but easily believed the sophistry of the rich peasant elements, and regarded the sharp class struggle as a "personal dispute" between the cadres and the rich peasant element Zhang Rui, thinking that most of the materials supplied by the township cadres were "personal prejudice" and "revenge"; therefore, they did not conduct any investigation or research and deal with Zhang Rui's reactionary behavior. As a result, Zhang Rui's reactionary arrogance became even more rampant. Now, when he hears some people complaining that they do not have enough grain to eat, he stands aside and sarcastically says: "Didn't the government leave you enough grain to eat? Why do you still say it is not enough?" The township cadres knew that this was a reactionary behavior of inciting the masses' dissatisfaction with the government, but they did not dare to take care of it. Until recently, the leading comrades of the county party committee still said: "I know about Zhang Rui, there is no problem, he is a well-to-do middle peasant." His main reasons were: "He sells the most grain"; "Although he lends money outside, there is no interest." In fact, both of these reasons are untenable. First, he sells a little more grain than the average peasant because he has much more grain than the average peasant, and it was only sold after the struggle of the masses. In fact, he should have sold more. Second, just looking at the situation of his buying and selling grain in large quantities and lending high-interest loans before the unified purchase of grain can show that he is a rich peasant, not a middle peasant. According to the township cadres and cooperative members, before the unified purchase of grain, Zhang Rui bought twenty or thirty dan of grain in the market every autumn and summer after the grain harvest. In the season when the old grain was running out and the new grain had not yet come in and the planting season, in addition to selling a portion at high prices, he carried out very cruel high-interest loan exploitation of the peasants. Many township cadres and peasants have borrowed his grain. For a term of one or two months, he charged three dou of interest for borrowing one dan, and returned it in small dou instead of large dou. A peasant (now the director of the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative) borrowed one dan of corn from him in the summer of 1952. When borrowing, he gave eight sheng less for one dan, and when returning, in addition to three dou of interest, he gave one dan and one dou, and he would not accept it if he lacked even a handful, and he added two jiao of money. Zhang Chongshan borrowed ten dan of corn from him. Because he was his relative, "he had human feelings," and did not ask for interest; but when returning the grain, he asked for ten dan of the best wheat. Even now, there is interest on the money he lends. The Liu Zhen and Hao Baoshan families borrowed 800 yuan from him, with an annual interest rate of 3%; Zhang Bin (his relative) borrowed 600 yuan from him. Although he did not charge interest, Zhang Bin's vehicles and horses had to be used by him without compensation. These three households are already known to everyone; it is still difficult to know how much usury he lends in a concealed form. Do the comrades of the county party committee know about these situations or not? If they know, why do they still think that Zhang Rui "has no problem"? If they don't know, why do they affirm so rashly that Zhang Rui "has no problem" without conducting an investigation?

　　Another thing is about Fangshu Township. The Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Yin Kun Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township have been rectified for a long time, and the rich peasants have also been "cleansed." However, until now, there are still two rich peasant households in the cooperative, and one of them is the accountant of the cooperative. According to the comrades of the work team, these two rich peasant households were retained at the request of the cooperative and approved by the district committee. The foundations of these two cooperatives are very poor: one is a "middle peasant cooperative" where the middle peasants who "separated" from the poor peasants in the cooperative account for the majority. The members are poorly aware, and they are still confronting the "poor peasant cooperative" where the poor peasants who were squeezed out account for the majority. The situation of the other cooperative is even worse. Not only are there rich peasants in the cooperative, but also puppet military officers. Under such circumstances, it is obvious whether the rich peasants can play a good or bad role in the cooperative, and whether the members can effectively supervise the rich peasants. The middle peasants excluding the poor peasants and "separating" from the poor peasants is essentially influenced by the rich peasant ideology. Even if the rich peasants do not engage in destructive activities on the surface, the ideological influence and behind-the-scenes conspiracies of the peasants cannot be ignored. Moreover, one of the rich peasant households behaved very reactionarily during the unified purchase of grain, and even from the surface, it was very un-"honest." So, who asked to retain them in the cooperative? Mainly the cooperative cadres. Why retain them? One of the reasons is that the rich peasants behave very "diligently" and "obediently" in front of them; they feel that "the rich peasants are more conscientious and responsible for the work of the cooperative than the average masses." They think that this rich peasant is a "good rich peasant," which is completely different from those bad rich peasants who destroy agricultural producers' cooperatives. Another reason why they asked to retain the rich peasants in the cooperative was that they saw that the rich peasants had better means of production. The rich peasants intentionally put horse sheds, pig pens, etc., into the cooperative; the cooperative cadres were afraid that they would not be able to use these "urgent things" after the rich peasants were cleansed. Some county and district cadres did not carefully analyze these situations, but simply used some examples of rich peasants openly destroying agricultural producers' cooperatives in other places to conduct education; as a result, they could not convince these cooperative cadres, and they themselves became confused, so they approved it perfunctorily. Recently, it is said that the rich peasant who had reactionary behavior during the unified purchase of grain has been cleansed out; but because the cadres' thinking has not been opened up, it is still "obviously out but secretly not out."

　　When dealing with the problem of the rich peasant element Zhang Rui, why could he be regarded as a "unity object," and the sharp class struggle was regarded as "personal prejudice"? Why could some comrades not convince the cooperative cadres with vague class views, but instead were made more confused by them? Why did the cooperative cadres "covet small gains and lose big ones" to cherish the rich peasants' things, and be blinded by their superficial "diligence" and "obedience"? These many problems have a common root: these comrades do not understand or do not understand the reactionary nature of the rich peasants (some comrades still think that only those who hire workers are rich peasants, and those who engage in usury and other exploitation are not rich peasants), ignore what kind of influence the rich peasant ideology will have in the cooperative and in the countryside, and think that the exploiting class will obediently surrender to the working people. It can be seen very clearly from the reactionary behavior of the rich peasant Zhang Rui that these rich peasants who mainly live by exploitation will not easily give up exploitation, and they will stubbornly resist the policy of restricting and gradually eliminating exploitation. Letting the rich peasants lend high-interest loans and destroy the unified purchase and sale, keeping the rich peasants in cooperatives with a very poor foundation when the masses' awareness is still relatively low, not being vigilant about the influence of the rich peasants at all times, and not paying attention to the struggle against the rich peasant ideology is tantamount to letting capitalist forces invade the socialist transformation cause. It must not be thought that excluding the poor peasants from the agricultural production cooperatives only shows the contradiction between the middle peasants and the poor peasants. In fact, doing so is not in line with the interests of the middle peasants, but in line with the interests of the rich peasants who intend to destroy the socialist transformation cause. Only by drawing a clear line with the rich peasants and carrying out a resolute struggle against the rich peasants can the middle peasants be closely united around the working class and the poor peasants; otherwise, even if agricultural production cooperatives are established, they may become tools of the rich peasants.

　　为什么对富农的破坏活动熟视无睹
　　剑虹
    在对农业实行社会主义改造的期间，农村中是有激烈的阶级斗争的。富农的人数虽然不多，而且在土地改革期间已经被削弱了，互助合作组织的发展又对富农有了限制；但是，阶级斗争并不是越来越和缓，而是越来越复杂，越来越尖锐了。但不少做农村工作的同志看不见富农分子同劳动农民之间的斗争，富农同工人阶级之间的斗争。他们常常从人数多寡和表面现象上看问题，这是十分有害的。有了这种看法，就会丧失对富农的警惕，就不能清醒地对待复杂的阶级斗争，就不能很好地依靠贫农和紧紧地团结中农，就会使对农业进行社会主义改造的事业遭受不可估量的损失。
    最近我在河北省涿县第五区了解到这样两件事：
    一件是松林店乡的事。这个乡有一个名叫张瑞的富农，在土地改革时因为他的土地不很多、只雇短工，被划成了富裕中农。实际上，他的主要收入是高利贷和粮食投机的剥削，应当划为富农成分。自贯彻总路线以来，农业生产合作社发展起来了，又实行了粮食统购统销，张瑞的剥削行为受到了很大的限制。因此，他对人民政府、干部和已经觉悟了的农民表现得特别仇恨，他怕本乡群众揭露他进行高利贷剥削的行为，就把公开的剥削变成了隐蔽的剥削，在本村只放钱给他最信任的人和比较落后的小商贩，而把大部分钱粮都转放到了外村。他的邻居说：“前年开始粮食统购前，张瑞每天天不明就跑到外村，偷偷地把高利放到外村的粮食都折成了钱，晚上没有人了才回家。”他用短工也都是从外村找。粮食统购工作开始以后，他就顽抗、大骂。群众向县人民政府控告了他的罪行，并且附去了他在外村大量放粮的材料。但是，县人民政府是怎样对待这个问题的呢？他们没有充分考虑群众的意见，而是很轻易地相信了富农分子的狡辩，竟把尖锐的阶级斗争看成了干部同富农分子张瑞之间的“个人纠纷”，认为乡干部供给的大部材料，是“个人成见”、“报复”；因此，对张瑞的反动行为没有作任何调查研究和处理。这样一来，张瑞的反动气焰更嚣张了。现在他听到有些群众嚷粮食不够吃，便站在一边讽刺说：“政府不是给你们留了足够吃的粮食吗？怎么还说不够呢？”乡干部们明知这是挑拨群众对政府不满的反动行为，也不敢去管了。直到最近，县委的领导同志仍然说：“张瑞这个户我知道，没有问题，是个富裕中农。”他的主要理由是：“他卖粮最多”；“虽然在外面放钱，但没有利息。”其实，这两个理由都是站不住脚的。第一、他卖粮比一般农民多一点，是因为他的粮食比一般农民多的多，而且是经群众斗争后才卖出的，实际上他应该卖得更多一点。第二、光看他在粮食统购以前大批买卖粮食和大量放高利贷的情况，就可以说明他是一个富农，并不是中农。据乡干部和社员们谈：粮食统购以前，张瑞每到秋夏粮食收获以后，在集市上一买就是二、三十石。到青黄不接和播种的季节，除高价出卖部分外，就对农民进行非常残酷的高利贷剥削。有许多乡干部和农民都借过他的粮食，一两个月的期限，借一石，三斗利，并是小斗借大斗还，一个农民（现在是黎明农业生产合作社社长）一九五二年夏天借了他一石玉米，借时一石少给八升，还时除三斗利外，给了一石一斗，缺一把都不行，又补给了二角钱。张重山借了他十石玉米，因为是他的本家，“有人情”，没有要利息；但还粮时要了十石最好的麦子。就是现在，借他的钱也不是没有利息的。刘振、郝宝山两家共借他八百元，年利三分；张宾（他的本家）借他六百元，虽然不要利息，但是张宾的车马要无代价地供他使用。这三户是大家已经知道的；他用隐蔽的形式放的高利贷究竟有多少，还很难弄清楚。县委的同志对这些情况究竟知道还是不知道？如果知道，为什么还认为张瑞“没有问题”？如果不知道，为什么不作调查就那么轻率地肯定张瑞“没有问题”？
    另一件是房树乡的事。这个乡的明星农业生产合作社和尹坤农业生产合作社已经进行了很长时期的整顿工作，对富农也算“清洗”过了。但是，直到现在，社内仍然保留着两户富农，而且有一个当了社内的会计员。据工作组的同志们说：这两户富农是社里要求保留，区委也批准了的。这两个社的基础都很差：一个是社内的中农同贫农“分家”分出来的中农占大多数的“中农社”，社员的觉悟很差，直到现在还在同被排挤出去的贫农占大多数的
  “贫农社”闹对立。另一个社的情况更不好，社内不但有富农，还有伪军官。在这种情况下，富农在社内能起好作用还是坏作用，社员能不能有效地监督富农，是很明显的。中农排挤贫农，同贫农“分家”，实质上正是受富农思想的影响。富农即使表面上不进行破坏活动，对农民的思想影响和背后的阴谋活动也不可忽视。何况，其中一户富农，在粮食统购时表现得很反动，就是从表面上看也是很不
  “老实”的。那么，是什么人要求保留他们在社内呢？主要是社干部。为什么要保留他们呢？原因之一是富农在他们面前表现得很“殷勤”、很“听话”；他们觉得“富农对社里的工作比一般群众还认真负责”，他们认为这个富农是个“好富农”，是完全不同于那些破坏农业生产合作社的坏富农的。他们要求保留富农在社内的又一个原因是看到富农有较好的生产资料。富农有意地把马棚猪圈等入了社；社干部怕清洗了富农以后就用不成这些“紧用的东西”。一些县、区干部，没有仔细分析这些情况，只是简单地一般地用别的地方富农公开破坏农业生产合作社的一些事例去进行教育；结果，说服不了这些社干部，他们自己也被弄糊涂了，于是便马马虎虎地批准了。最近，据说已把那户在粮食统购时有反动行为的富农清洗出去了；但由于没有打通干部思想，还是“明出暗不出”。
    在处理富农分子张瑞的问题时，为什么能把他看成了“团结对象”，把尖锐的阶级斗争看成了
  “私人成见”呢？有些同志为什么说服不了阶级观点模糊的社干部，反被他们弄得更糊涂了呢？社干部为什么要“贪小失大”地稀罕富农那点东西，并且被他们表面的“殷勤”和“听话”蒙蔽了呢？这许多问题有一个共同的根源：这些同志不了解或不太了解富农的反动的本质（有些同志还认为只有雇工的人才算富农，进行高利贷等剥削的不算是富农），忽视了富农思想在社内、在农村中会起怎样的影响，竟认为剥削阶级会乖乖地向劳动人民投降。从富农张瑞的反动行为中可以看得很明白，这些主要靠剥削为生的富农，他们是不会轻易地放弃剥削的，他们对于限制和逐步消灭剥削的政策是要进行顽抗的。放任富农放高利贷和破坏统购统销，在群众觉悟还比较低的时候把富农留在基础很差的社里，不时时刻刻警惕富农的影响，不注意对富农思想进行斗争，就等于放任资本主义势力侵袭社会主义改造事业。决不能认为把贫农排斥出农业生产合作社，只是表现了中农和贫农的矛盾，实际上，这样做是并不符合中农的利益的，而是符合存心破坏社会主义改造事业的富农的利益的。只有同富农划清界限，同富农作坚决的斗争，才可能紧紧地把中农团结在工人阶级和贫农的周围；不然，即使办了农业生产合作社，也有可能变成富农的工具。
