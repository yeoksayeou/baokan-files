Xinhua News Agency, Lushun, 6th -- According to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué, the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area, who are being withdrawn back to their country in batches, were warmly seen off by the people of the Lushunkou area before their departure.

　　In recent days, several grand farewell meetings with more than 10,000 people have been held in the Lushunkou area. The people who came to see them off were dressed in festive costumes, beating gongs and drums. At these farewell meetings, many people presented the heroic Soviet troops with silk banners embroidered with patterns and words symbolizing the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and expressing gratitude to the Soviet troops for defending Lushunkou. The Soviet troops also gave many precious gifts to local government agencies, people's organizations, and the people, expressing their infinite love for the Chinese people.

　　Before the Soviet troops departed, many workers, farmers, and street residents held small-scale get-togethers and family gatherings with them. When the residents of Zhao Jia Street in Lushun City heard the news that the Soviet troops were about to return home, they asked to meet and talk with the Soviet troops a few more times. The residents of this street and the Soviet troops held three get-togethers and shared a hearty dinner together; they exchanged gifts as souvenirs.

　　When the Soviet soldiers and officers set off to return to their country, the platform was filled with people who had come early to see them off. People bid farewell to the Soviet troops with reluctance. Bouquets of flowers were stuffed into the hands of the Soviet soldiers and officers. Many people warmly shook hands and embraced the Soviet soldiers and officers and their families. Among the crowd of people seeing them off, Shi Shangzhi, a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, took out his photo and gave it to a Soviet soldier. Before boarding the train, Soviet soldier Shashi gave a Chinese soldier a handbook, on which he wrote: "When we leave China, we warmly thank you for your sincere love and care for our Soviet soldiers. We sincerely wish you greater achievements in the construction of the new China." At the station, many Soviet soldiers and officers took group photos with the people of the Lushunkou area as souvenirs.

　　旅顺地区人民热情欢送苏军回国
    据新华社旅大六日电　按照中苏会谈公报规定正在陆续撤退回国的驻旅顺口地区的苏军，临别前受到了旅顺口地区人民热烈的欢送。
    连日以来，旅顺口地区举行了好几个拥有一万多人的盛大欢送会。欢送的人们穿着节日的盛装，敲锣打鼓地来到会场。在这些欢送会上，许多人把绣有标志中苏两国友谊和感谢苏军保卫旅顺口的图案和字样的锦旗献给英勇的苏军部队。苏军部队在会上也送给当地政府机关、人民团体和人民群众很多珍贵的礼品，表示他们对中国人民的无限热爱。
    苏军临别以前，许多职工、农民和街道居民等还和他们举行了小型联欢会和家庭聚会。旅顺市赵家街居民听说苏军快要回国的消息时，街道居民纷纷要求同苏军多见几次面，多谈谈心。这条街道的居民和苏军曾先后举行了三次联欢会，并且曾在一起共进了一次丰盛的晚餐；他们互相赠送了礼物留作纪念。
    苏军将士启程返国时，火车站台上很早就赶来了等候欢送的人群。人们怀着依依惜别的心情和苏军告别。一束束的鲜花塞到苏军将士们的手里。许多人热情地和苏军将士以及苏军将士的家属握手、拥抱。在送行的人群中，中国人民解放军战士石上志拿出自己的照片来送给一个苏军战士。苏军战士沙士在登上火车前，送给一个中国战士一本手册，手册上写道：“当我们离开中国的时候，我们热情地感谢你们对我们苏联军人的真诚爱戴和关怀。我们衷心地预祝你们在新中国的建设事业中取得更大的成就。”在车站上，许多苏军将士同旅顺口地区的人民在一起合影留念。
