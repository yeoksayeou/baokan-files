　　The New Face of Han River Shipping
　　Kang Guoquan
　　The Han River is a tributary of the Yangtze River, originating in Shaanxi, passing through northwestern Hubei, flowing into Wuhan, and merging into the Yangtze. It is a river with a fierce temperament. Before liberation, on the 1,134-li waterway from Xiangfan to Wuhan, only leather rafts and sailing boats could travel. (Small steamships could navigate between Hankou and Laohekou during the spring and summer flood season.) Because the Han River is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, with dangerous shoals, sharp bends, and a constantly changing channel, countless wooden boats were damaged and many lives were lost over the years. Among the boatmen of the Han River, a folk song has always been circulated:
　　The Han River twists and turns,
　　Everywhere are shoals upon shoals.
　　Three hundred and sixty named shoals,
　　Three hundred and sixty unnamed shoals.
　　Named shoals and unnamed shoals,
　　It's hard to pass if not well planned.

　　However, the Han River is also an important river. The mountainous area of northwestern Hubei on both banks of the Han River is rich in grain and cotton, and also produces a large amount of medicinal materials, tung oil, cowhide, and other local mountain products. The people of the mountainous area of northwestern Hubei have long hoped that modern steamships could travel from Hankou to Xiangfan, bringing them industrial products and selling their local mountain products. But during the Kuomintang rule, the reactionary government and shipping capitalists were unwilling to open this route, which was high in cost and dangerous.

　　After liberation, in order to change the backward state of Han River transportation, the Hubei Provincial Department of Transportation's Inland Navigation Administration began planning the reconstruction of Han River transportation in 1952. The responsible personnel went to various parts of the Han River several times to investigate the water conditions, and successively organized surveying teams and economic investigation teams, trekking thousands of miles, enduring severe cold and heat, to conduct surveys and investigations along the entire Han River and in various coastal areas.

　　After several years of effort, the work of dredging the Han River channel has made great progress. The dangerous bends, narrow channels, and reefs that threatened navigation between Xiangfan and Hankou were initially eliminated. Four hundred and seventy-nine navigational aids such as shore markers and buoys were newly installed (thousands of temporary pole-shaped markers were not counted), of which two hundred and sixty-six can emit light for navigation at night; mobile channel-dragging boats were also set up in areas with frequently changing channels. In order to discover changes in the channel in time and ensure the safe navigation of tugs and barges, thirty channel survey boats were also set up between Xiangfan and Hankou, with an average of one boat every thirty-five li. Now the mileage of the Han River where ships can travel has increased more than two and a half times compared to 1950.

　　While整治rectifying the Han River channel, the Hubei Provincial Inland Navigation Administration also actively built and rebuilt a large number of shallow-water passenger ships and tugboats suitable for navigating the Han River. In 1954, the number of passenger and tugboats participating in Han River navigation increased more than three times compared with 1952; even more compared with 1950.

　　Now, on the more than 1,000-li waterway from Xiangfan to Hankou, in addition to a large number of wooden boats, there are also passenger and cargo ships and convoys of tugs and barges, bringing industrial products to the mountainous areas and local mountain products to the cities, sailing on the Han River day and night.

　　The changes in Han River transportation have made the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas increasingly prosperous, and the lives of the people on both sides of the river have also improved. In the years of Kuomintang reactionary rule, the abundant resources in these areas could not be transported out in large quantities, and the daily necessities such as salt and cloth needed by the people could not be transported in in large quantities. For example, the people in the Fang County mountain area of northern Hubei used to feel the greatest lack of salt, but now they can get a sufficient supply, and the price is also very cheap. According to an economic survey in 1954, the cost of salt transferred from Hankou to the Ankang area of Shaanxi via the Han River was only 18 cents per catty, which was half the cost of salt transferred from Qinghai to Gansu; in the past, the freight for oil and fat transported from Nanyang, Henan to Guangzhou via Hankou by car and train was also twice as high as the current freight for transport from the Tangbai River and the Han River to Guangzhou via Hankou. Now the people in the vast areas of southern Shaanxi, southwestern Henan, and northwestern Hubei can also buy a large number of daily necessities, cloth, new-style animal-powered farm implements, and fertilizer transported from Hankou via the Han River, and at the same time, they can also transport their large quantities of local specialties and agricultural products to all parts of the country via the Han River.

　　Now, all the staff of the Hubei Provincial Inland Navigation Administration are actively taking measures to extend the Han River route to Laohekou, 180 li from Xiangfan, this year. This is the cargo transfer point for Xichuan in Henan, Baihe in Shaanxi, and Yunyang and Gucheng in Hubei. To this end, the channel workers have already excavated more than 6,000 cubic meters of silt in the Shihuiyao area of the Han River in the first quarter of this year; dredged a 6-meter-wide and 180-meter-long channel, and the workers at the shipyard built the "Yunyang" and "Yunxi" two shallow-water tugboats suitable for Han River navigation, which were completed and launched on April 29 and are now sailing on the Han River. New tugboats are also being built one after another.

　　With the development of the motherland's economic construction, the future Han River transportation will be even more prosperous.

### 汉水航运的新面貌

　　汉水航运的新面貌
　　康国权
    汉水是长江的一条支流，它发源于陕西，穿过鄂西北，流入武汉市，汇入长江。这是一条性情凶暴的河流。解放以前，从襄樊到武汉长达一千一百三十四里的河道上，只能行驶皮筏和帆船。（春夏涨水时期汉口到老河口之间可通航小火轮）由于汉水上宽下窄、滩险弯急、航道多变，多少年来，也不知损坏了多少木船和丧失了多少人的生命。在汉水船民中，一直流传着这样的歌谣：
    汉水江弯又弯，
    到处都是滩连滩。
    三百六十有名滩，
    三百六十无名滩。
    有名滩无名滩，
    安排不好难过关。
    但是，汉水又是一条重要的河流。在汉水两岸的鄂西北山区，盛产粮食和棉花，还出产大量的药材、桐油、牛皮等土产山货。鄂西北山区的人民早就盼望能有近代化的轮船从汉口一直开到襄樊，带给他们工业品，卖出他们的土产山货。可是在国民党统治的时候，反动政府和航业资本家们是不愿意开辟这条成本高、危险大的航线的。
    解放后，为了改变汉水运输的落后状况，湖北省交通厅内河航运管理局从一九五二年起就筹划改建汉水运输的工作，负责的工作人员几次到汉水各地考察水情，并先后组织了勘测队和经济调查小组，跋涉千里，忍受严寒和酷热，在汉水全线和沿岸各地区进行勘测和调查。
    经过几年的努力，疏浚汉水航道的工作取得了很大成绩。初步消除了襄樊和汉口之间威胁航行的急弯、窄泓和暗礁等，新设了岸标、浮标等助航设备四百七十九座（上千计的临时棒型标未计算），其中有二百六十六座可以在夜间发光导航；在航道多变的地区还设立了机动拖泓船。为了及时发现航道变化情况，保证轮驳安全航行，襄樊和汉口之间还设立了探泓划三十只，平均近三十五里即有一只。现在汉水可以行驶轮船的里程，已经比一九五零年时增加两倍半以上。
    在整治汉水航道的同时，湖北省内河航运管理局又积极地新建和改建了大批适合于汉水航行的浅水客轮和拖轮。一九五四年参加汉水行驶的客、拖轮数量同一九五二年相比，增加了两倍以上；同一九五零年相比，还要更多。
    现在，在襄樊到汉口一千多里的河道上，除了大批木船之外，还有一艘艘的客货轮和一列列的拖驳，它们把工业品带到山区，把土产山货带到城市，日日夜夜航行在汉水上。
    汉水运输面貌的改变，使城乡物资交流日趋繁荣，沿河两岸人民的生活也随着提高了。在国民党反动统治的年月里，这些地区的丰富的物资不能大量运出，人民需要的食盐、布匹等日常用品也不能大量运进。例如鄂北房县山区的人民，过去最感到缺乏的是食盐，现在他们可以得到充足的供应，而且价钱也很便宜。根据一九五四年经济调查，从汉口经汉水调运到陕西安康地区的食盐，每斤成本只需一角八分，比由青海经甘肃调运的食盐成本便宜一半；过去由河南南阳用汽车、火车运经汉口转广州的油脂运费，也较现在由唐白河、汉水经汉口转广州的运费高一倍。现在陕南、豫西南、鄂西北广大地区人民还可以买到由汉口经汉水运去的大批日常用品、布匹、新式畜力农具和肥田粉，同时也可以把他们的大批土特产和农产品经汉水运到祖国各地。
    现在，湖北省内河航运管理局的全体职工正在积极地采取措施，在今年内把汉水航线延伸到距襄樊一百八十里地的老河口，这是河南淅川、陕西白河、湖北郧阳、谷城等县的货物啣接点。为此，航道工作人员们在今年第一季度已经在汉水石灰窑地区挖去了淤泥六千余公方；疏浚了宽六公尺、长一百八十公尺的航道，修船厂的工人们建造了“郧阳”“郧西”两条适合汉水行驶的浅水拖轮，四月二十九日已经竣工下水航行在汉水上。目前还正陆续建造新的拖轮。
    随着祖国经济建设的发展，今后的汉水运输将更加繁荣了。
