    In recent years, with the development of production, the employee continuing education at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has achieved remarkable results. Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel has nine employee elementary schools, eight employee middle schools, two employee secondary technical schools, one employee industrial university, and one preparatory class attached to it. In addition, there are also literacy classes, higher primary classes, and middle school classes run by various factories and mines themselves. By the summer of 1954, the number of graduates from literacy classes and higher primary classes had reached more than 11,000, the number of graduates from employee junior middle schools had reached more than 1,100, and the number of graduates from employee senior middle schools was about 50. The main courses studied by students in various classes can basically reach the graduation level equivalent to that of ordinary schools. Employee continuing education at Anshan Iron and Steel has improved the cultural and scientific knowledge level of employees, played a strong role in promoting production, and provided favorable conditions for cultivating engineering and technical cadres, enterprise administrative management cadres, and further cultivating intermediate and senior construction talents. From 1951 to 1953, Anshan Iron and Steel promoted 748 engineering and technical cadres and 593 cadres above the level of workshop director and engineering team leader from skilled workers who had improved their cultural level. In the summer of 1953 alone, about 50 students from various employee schools at Anshan Iron and Steel were admitted to institutions such as Northeast Institute of Technology and Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology.
    The employee schools run by Anshan Iron and Steel are diverse. Since the launch of employee continuing education in 1949, a brand-new employee school system has begun to take shape by 1953, including various levels and types of employee schools suitable for employees to study. These employee schools have all formulated relatively standardized school systems and courses according to different training goals and based on needs and possibilities. At the same time, they have all been able to establish practical and feasible management systems from the characteristics of employee schools, so they can basically ensure quality and achieve the goal of cultivating construction talents. This brand-new employee school system is in line with the future development prospects of employee continuing education and also in line with the spirit of the new school system.
    The employee schools at Anshan Iron and Steel have developed through continuous exploration. In 1952, in order to improve the level of skilled workers and train technical cadres, Anshan Iron and Steel organized five technical night schools for workers with a higher primary school education. Each school set up majors such as machinery, electrical engineering, chemical industry, and metallurgy, and the curriculum was set up with junior high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and professional courses in coordination. After half a year of teaching, due to the low cultural level of the students and the lack of basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, it was necessary to cancel the technical courses and turn the technical night schools into employee middle schools for learning culture. At present, it is fully realized from the employee continuing education held by Anshan Iron and Steel that running employee junior middle schools is an important step in cultivating and training technical cadres, and junior middle school cultural courses are the basis for learning technical theoretical courses. Therefore, the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel paid special attention to the development of employee junior middle schools and regarded it as a component of technical education.
    Practice has proved that continuing education is an important method for improving cadres. According to a survey, among the 69 cadres who participated in continuing education in 1951, 47 had elementary school education, 21 had junior middle school education, and 1 had senior middle school education; but after studying in employee schools, by April 1954, 3 had been promoted to university level, 28 had been promoted to senior middle school level, 35 had been promoted to junior middle school level, and only 3 remained at the higher primary school level. Chen Yizhi, director of the Equipment Department of Anshan Iron and Steel, is a particularly outstanding example. He started in the first grade of junior middle school in 1951. After several years of continuous study, he completed the first-year curriculum of the employee university and has been selected to study in the Soviet Union. Furthermore, responsible comrades such as the general manager, manager, and director of the Power Department of Anshan Iron and Steel have all been insisting on continuing education, and their scores in various subjects are often four or five points.
    The organization of continuing education for cadres, whether in terms of organizational form, study time, or teaching methods, must adapt to the characteristics of cadres. Cadres are the backbone of production and administrative management work. Their positions are important, they have many meetings, and it is difficult to organize them to study together with ordinary employees. Therefore, the cadre study at Anshan Iron and Steel is organized into separate classes according to their level, and classes are scheduled in the morning, one and a half hours each day. With the approval of the company manager, a little bit of work time can also be used, so cadres can insist on studying. The cultural situation of cadres is generally that they have rich social science knowledge but lack natural science knowledge, so the curriculum focuses on learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry. They generally have strong comprehension and a spirit of inquiry; however, they have no time to review after class, and the knowledge they have learned is not easy to consolidate. Therefore, when teaching, it is necessary to explain the principles clearly so that students can fully understand the content of the course; at the same time, the method of "teaching in class and doing homework in class" is adopted, requiring students to basically understand the content of the study in the classroom, and no other exercises are left after class. For those who are absent from class and those who are studying poorly, special personnel are responsible for tutoring outside of class to help them study. These methods have proven to be effective for cadre study.
    Employee continuing education is a major part of the enterprise's training plan. The enterprise administrative leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel, due to the urgent needs of production development, attached relatively great importance to employee continuing education from the beginning. In the five-year training plan, they clearly proposed: to conduct cultural and technical education for workers with higher primary school education so that they can reach the level of secondary technical schools; to conduct technical education for workers with junior middle school education so that they can reach the graduation level of secondary technical schools, and pay attention to training cadres from them; for production technical cadres and enterprise administrative management cadres who are from worker backgrounds, mainly to make up for mathematics, physics, and chemistry so that they can reach the graduation level of secondary technical schools; for those who are from intellectual backgrounds and are not at the level of universities and specialized schools, they should continue to improve to the level of universities and specialized schools. To achieve the above requirements, mainly through continuing education, the various levels of employee schools at Anshan Iron and Steel are a component of the training plan.
    In order to run employee schools well, Anshan Iron and Steel has taken a series of measures: it has established a special management agency—the Education Department, equipped with full-time cadres, and solved problems such as funding, teachers, material equipment, and study time. For example, in 1952, a large number of outstanding technicians and staff members were mobilized to teach part-time in employee middle schools. In addition, more than 20 secondary technicians were transferred to serve as full-time cadres and full-time teachers in employee middle schools. The funding for employee middle schools is all paid by the administrative training fees. In order to ensure study time, it is stipulated that the meeting time for employees shall not exceed one hour per day, and the remaining spare time shall be freely disposed of by employees. Because the ideological work is done well and learning is voluntary, most students can persist in learning. Therefore, the study time of Anshan Iron and Steel's employee middle schools has always been able to guarantee five times a week, a total of ten hours. This has also provided favorable conditions for ensuring the completion of learning tasks.

　　鞍山钢铁公司的职工业余教育
　　李炎
    几年来，随着生产的发展，鞍山钢铁公司的职工业余教育，获得了显著的成绩。现在鞍钢有职工业余初等学校九所，业余中学八所，业余中等技术学校二所，业余工业大学及其附设的预备班各一所，另外还有各厂矿自办的扫除文盲班、高小班和中学班。到一九五四年暑期，扫除文盲班和高小班毕业学员已达一万一千多人，业余初中毕业学员达一千一百多人，业余高中毕业学员约五十多人。各种班次学员所学的主要课程，基本上能达到相当于普通学校的毕业水平。鞍钢的职工业余教育，提高了职工的文化科学知识水平，在生产上起了有力的推动作用，并给培养工程技术干部、企业行政管理干部，和进一步培养中、高级建设人材提供了有利条件。自一九五一年到一九五三年间，鞍钢从提高了文化的技术工人中，曾提拔了工程技术干部七百四十八人，车间主任和工程队长以上干部五百九十三人。仅一九五三年暑期，鞍钢各业余学校学员考取东北工学院、北京钢铁工业学院等院校的就有五十人左右。
    鞍钢举办的职工业余学校是多种多样的。自一九四九年开展职工业余教育以来，到一九五三年已开始形成了一个崭新的业余学校系统，包括着适合职工学习的各级各类业余学校。这些职工业余学校，都根据不同的培养目标，根据需要和可能，制定了比较正规的学制和课程；同时，又都能从业余学校的特点出发，建立了切实可行的管理制度，所以，都能够基本上保证质量，达到培养建设人材的目的。这个崭新的业余学校系统，是符合今后职工业余教育的发展远景的，也是符合新学制的精神的。
    鞍钢的职工业余学校是在不断摸索中发展起来的。一九五二年鞍钢为了提高技术工人的水平，培养技术干部，曾为高小毕业程度的工人，举办了五个技术夜校。各校分设机械、电机、化工、冶炼等专业，课程设置是初中的数学、物理、化学和专业课配合进行。经过半年的教学，因学员文化水平低，没有基础的数理化知识，曾不得不取消技术课，把技术夜校变成学习文化的业余中学。目前，从鞍钢举办职工业余教育中充分体会到：举办职工业余中学乃是培养训练技术干部的重要步骤，而初中的文化课则是学习技术理论课程的基础。因此，鞍钢领导方面就特别注意了职工业余中学的发展，并把它当作技术教育的组成部分。
    实践证明，业余教育是提高干部的重要方法。据调查，一九五一年参加业余学习的六十九名干部中，小学文化程度的四十七人，初中文化程度的二十一人，高中文化程度的一人；但经过业余学校学习，到一九五四年四月，已有三人提高到大学程度，二十八人提高到高中程度，三十五人提高到初中程度，高小程度的只剩下三人了。成绩特别突出的如鞍钢设备处处长陈一之，一九五一年开始上初中一年级，经过几年不间断的学习，学完了业余大学一年级的课程后，已被选送去苏联学习。又如鞍钢总经理、经理、动力处处长等负责同志，都一直在坚持业余学习，他们的各科成绩，经常是四分、五分。
    组织干部的业余学习，无论是组织形式，学习时间，教学方法，都必须使之适应干部的特点。干部是生产和行政管理工作的骨干，他们的职务重，会议多，和一般职工组织在一起学习，是有很多困难的。所以，鞍钢的干部学习是按程度单独编班，上课时间都安排在早晨，每天学习一个半小时，经公司经理批准，还可以占用一点工作时间，因而干部都能坚持学习。干部的文化情况，一般是社会科学知识丰富，自然科学知识缺乏，因此课程设置以学习数学、物理、化学为主。他们一般是理解力强，有钻研精神；但课后无复习时间，学得的知识不易巩固。因此，在教学时必须讲清道理，使学员充分领会课程内容；同时采取“当堂教、当堂作业”的办法，要求学员在课堂内基本上能弄懂学习内容，课后不留其他习题。对缺课和学习较差的，则由专人负责课外辅导，以帮助其学习。这些办法，证明对干部学习都是有效的。
    职工业余教育是实现企业培养训练计划的一个主要部分。鞍钢的企业行政领导方面，由于生产发展的迫切需要，一开始便比较重视职工业余教育。在五年培养训练计划中，他们曾明确地提出：要对高小程度的工人进行文化和技术教育，使达到中等技术学校水平；对初中程度的工人，主要进行技术教育，使达到中等技术学校毕业程度，并注意从中培养干部；对生产技术干部和企业行政管理干部，属于工人出身的，主要补习数学、物理、化学，使达到中等技术学校毕业程度；属于知识分子出身，不足大学和专科学校程度的，要继续提高到大学和专科学校的水平。为达到上述要求，主要是通过业余教育，鞍钢的各级业余学校，就是实现培养训练计划的一个组成部分。
    为了办好职工业余学校，鞍钢曾采取了一系列的措施：设立了专管机构——教育处，配备了专职干部，解决了经费、师资、物质设备、学习时间等问题。如一九五二年曾动员了大批优秀技术人员和职员到业余中学去兼课。另外，又抽调二十多名中等技术人员担任业余中学的专职干部和专职教师。业余中学的经费全部由行政培养训练费开支。为了保证学习时间，规定职工每天开会时间不得超过一小时，其余业余时间，由职工自由支配。由于思想工作做得好，学习出于自愿，学员大都能坚持学习。因而鞍钢业余中学的学习时间，一直能保证每周五次，共十小时。这对保证学习任务的完成，也提供了有利的条件。
