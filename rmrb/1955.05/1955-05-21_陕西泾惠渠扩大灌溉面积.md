　  Shaanxi's Jinghui Canal Expands Irrigation Area

　  Shaanxi Province's Jinghui Canal expanded its irrigation area by more than 20,240 mu during the spring water release and irrigation period. Now, the irrigation area of the Jinghui Canal has increased to 743,300 mu.

　  The farmland that was expanded for irrigation this spring is located in Lintong County, downstream of the canal. The irrigation water from the canal not only allowed the timely sowing of over 12,000 mu of cotton fields but also increased wheat production by more than 100 jin per mu in over 8,000 mu of wheat fields.

　  This spring, in addition to carrying out general spring repair projects, the Jinghui Canal also carefully inspected the entire canal and various structures, repaired ten places with water seepage and leakage, and extended more than forty branch and sub-canals. Canal management personnel also formulated a spring irrigation water distribution plan through calculations of canal water supply and the possibility of sediment occurrence, and established water distribution agencies, thereby curbing the past phenomenon of inaccurate and unbalanced water distribution.

　  陕西泾惠渠扩大灌溉面积
    陕西省泾惠渠在春季放水灌溉期间扩大了灌溉面积两万零二百四十多亩。现在，泾惠渠灌溉区的面积已增加到七十四万三千三百多亩。
    今春被扩大灌溉的农田，位于渠道下游的临潼县境。这些农田由于得到渠水灌溉，不仅使其中的一万二千多亩棉田适时下种，而且使八千多亩麦田每亩能增产一百多斤小麦。
    今年春季，泾惠渠除进行了一般的春修工程外，并仔细检查整个渠道和各项建筑物，修补了十处渗水和漏水的地方，延长了四十多条斗渠和分渠。渠道管理人员又通过渠道供水量和泥沙出现可能性的推算，制定出春季灌溉配水计划，设立了配水机构，从而制止了过去水量分配不准确、不平衡的现象。　（新华社）
