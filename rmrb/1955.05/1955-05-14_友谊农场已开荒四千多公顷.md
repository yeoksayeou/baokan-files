　　Friendship Farm Reclaims Over Four Thousand Hectares
    Since the Friendship State Farm began land reclamation on May 2nd, as of the 10th, the staff and workers have reclaimed 4,670 hectares of wasteland for the country in nine days. This exceeds the original plan by 26.5 percent and completes 22.4 percent of the farm's total land reclamation task for this year. During the land reclamation process, the staff and workers launched an intense labor emulation campaign. The ten locomotives of the Second Production Team exceeded their work quota on the second day of formal land reclamation. Li Yingjun's "Stalin 80" locomotive team accepted the suggestions of Soviet experts and increased the number of ploughshares attached to the tractor from five to seven. As a result, on the night of the 5th, they created a farm-wide record by reclaiming nine hectares (the quota was six hectares) in one shift (ten hours). Subsequently, they broke their previous record with a record of ten hectares and the quality was good. Five of the nine locomotives deployed by the Sixth Production Team exceeded their quota. As a result of the large-scale labor emulation campaign, by the 10th, four of the farm's five branches had exceeded their original ten-day work plan.

　　友谊农场已开荒四千多公顷
    国营友谊农场自五月二日开始开荒到十日为止，职工们已在九天中给国家开垦了四千六百七十公顷荒地，超过了原订计划百分之二十六点五，完成了今年农场全部开荒任务的百分之二十二点四。开荒中，职工们展开了紧张的劳动竞赛。第二生产队的十台机车在正式开荒的第二天便超额完成作业任务。该队斯大林八十号机车李英俊包车组接受了苏联专家的建议，将拖拉机所带犁铧由五个增到七个，因而在五日夜间便以一班（十小时）的工作时间创造了开荒九公顷（定额为六公顷）的全场最高纪录。其后，又以十公顷的纪录突破了前项纪录，并且质量也良好。第六生产队出动的九台机车中有五台都超过了定额。由于大规模开展劳动竞赛的结果，截至十日止，全场五个分场中有四个分场都已超额完成了原订的一旬作业计划。
