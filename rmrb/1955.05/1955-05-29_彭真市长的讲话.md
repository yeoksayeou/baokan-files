Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech

Respected Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　We, the citizens of Beijing, welcome the distinguished guest of our government, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo of the Republic of Indonesia, with great pleasure.

　　We know that the Asian-African Conference of great historical significance was held in Bandung, Indonesia, and the government and people of the Republic of Indonesia made tremendous efforts for the success of the Asian-African Conference. The achievements of this conference will certainly be conducive to the struggle against colonialism, to defending peace in Asia and the world, and to promoting friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries.

　　We know that not long ago Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Republic of Indonesia and issued a joint statement with Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo. This joint statement is not only of great significance for the development of friendly relations between the two countries, but also once again provides a vivid example of peaceful coexistence to the world.

　　Indonesia is by no means a strange country to the citizens of Beijing. In recent years, people have often talked about Indonesia in friendly and affectionate tones. In the past two years, more than two hundred Indonesian friends have visited Beijing, some representing the government, others from the people, and they have all brought invaluable friendship. They have been warmly welcomed and cordially received by the citizens of Beijing. Last year, the Indonesian Art Troupe visited our country and left us with a deep impression, which strengthened the cultural relations between our two countries. People in Beijing's cultural and artistic circles have given high praise to the cultural and artistic achievements of the Indonesian people.

　　Prime Minister, today we are even more honored and pleased to be able to welcome and receive you, your wife, and your colleagues here. We sincerely hope that you will be able to see everything you want to see in Beijing. Whether modern or ancient, new or old, progressive or backward, we warmly welcome your visit, and sincerely hope you will give us your criticisms and guidance.

　　We ask you, respected Prime Minister, to convey our friendship and respect to the citizens of Jakarta and all the people of Indonesia.

　　Long live friendly cooperation between China and Indonesia!
　　Long live Asian peace!
　　Long live world peace!

　　彭真市长的讲话尊敬的阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理阁下：各位女士，各位先生：
    我们北京市民以极大的愉快心情欢迎我国政府的贵宾、印度尼西亚共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约阁下。
    我们知道，具有重大历史意义的亚非会议是在印度尼西亚的万隆举行的，印度尼西亚共和国政府和人民对亚非会议的成功作了巨大的努力。这个会议的成就肯定地有利于反对殖民主义的斗争，有利于保卫亚洲和世界的和平，有利于促进亚非国家之间的友好合作。
    我们知道，不久以前周恩来总理访问了印度尼西亚共和国，并且和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理阁下发表了一项联合声明。这项联合声明，不仅对发展两国的友好关系具有重要的意义，而且再一次向全世界提供了一个和平共处的生动范例。
    印度尼西亚对于北京市民来说绝不是一个陌生的国家。近几年来人们常常以亲切友好的声音谈论着印度尼西亚。印度尼西亚朋友们，在这两年中，先后到过北京访问的已有二百多人，他们有的代表官方，有的来自民间，他们都带来了极可珍贵的友谊。他们得到了北京市民的热烈欢迎和亲切招待。去年印度尼西亚艺术团来我国访问，给我们留下了深刻的印象，密切了我们两国的文化关系。北京文化界和艺术界的人士，对印度尼西亚人民的文化艺术成就，给予很高的评价。
    总理阁下：今天我们更因为能在这里欢迎和接待您、您的夫人、和您的同事们而深感荣幸和愉快。我们真诚地希望你们在北京将能看到你们所希望看到的一切。无论是现代的或古老的，新的或旧的，进步的或落后的，我们都热情地欢迎参观，同时诚恳地希望你们给予批评和指教。
    我们请您、尊敬的总理阁下，将我们的友谊和敬意，转达给雅加达市民和印度尼西亚全体人民。
    中国和印度尼西亚友好合作万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
