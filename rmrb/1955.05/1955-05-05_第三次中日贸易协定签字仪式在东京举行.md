　　The Chinese representatives signing the agreement included Lei Renmin, head of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan, Deputy Heads Li Zhuchen and Lu Xuzhang, and all fourteen members of the delegation. The Japanese representatives signing the agreement included Murata Shozo, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Ikeda Masanosuke, Representative Director of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, and thirteen Japanese negotiating representatives.

　　Also attending the signing ceremony were Hirano Yoshitaro, Kawakatsu Den, Miyakoshi Kisuke, Kinoshita Gengo, Tanaka Minoru, Hozumi Shichiro, Sasaki Kōzō, Kasuga Kazuyuki, and other members of the Welcome Committee for the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan formed by the two Japanese negotiating groups; representatives from various sectors of Japan including Uchina Kanzo, Kawasumi Michio, Ito Inosuke; representatives of enterprises from various parts of Japan; representatives of overseas Chinese; representatives of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan; and advisors, experts, and all staff members of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan.

　　After exchanging the signed originals of the agreement, Murata Shozo, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, delivered a speech first. He said: "This Sino-Japanese trade agreement, concluded based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and the purpose of developing trade between the two countries, has made some revisions and supplements on the basis of the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement so that this agreement can adapt to the current actual situation and be suitable for the future development of trade." Murata Shozo continued: "Due to the various obstacles that still exist in payment issues and other issues, the solution to these problems in this agreement cannot be said to be satisfactory. We hope to eliminate these obstacles and achieve the normalization of trade between China and Japan as soon as possible, and we are willing to continue to work towards this."

　　Ikeda Masanosuke stated in his speech that the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade would make further efforts to resolve the issues in this agreement that still need to be resolved in the future.

　　Head of Delegation Lei Renmin congratulated the signing of this Sino-Japanese trade agreement in his speech. He pointed out that this negotiation was fruitful, as evidenced by the fact that the new trade agreement made beneficial revisions and supplements to the lists of goods to be exported by both sides, commodity inspection and arbitration, and other issues on the basis of the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and made specific provisions for holding commodity exhibitions in each other's countries. On the issues of payment settlement and the establishment of commercial representative offices in each other's countries, the two sides fully exchanged views and have made decisions. Both sides agreed that these two issues are of great importance to the development of trade between China and Japan and need to be realized as soon as possible through joint efforts.

　　Head of Delegation Lei Renmin said: "We believe that Prime Minister Hatoyama's support and assistance for the signing of this Sino-Japanese trade agreement is beneficial to the smooth realization of this trade agreement, and we hope that concrete measures will be taken to achieve its realization as soon as possible."

　　Head of Delegation Lei Renmin concluded by saying: "Both China and Japan have a responsibility to strive to promote consultations between the two governments on Sino-Japanese trade issues as soon as possible in accordance with the provisions of the agreement and sign an agreement so as to normalize Sino-Japanese trade relations and enable the potential of Sino-Japanese trade to be fully developed."

　　Murata Shozo and Head of Delegation Lei Renmin also exchanged letters regarding the Japanese government's expression of support and assistance for this Sino-Japanese trade agreement and Head of Delegation Lei Renmin's reply after receiving the letter.

    雷任民团长说：我们认为，鸠山总理大臣对这次签订的中日贸易协定所表示的支持和协助，对这次贸易协定的顺利实现是有利的，希望能采取具体措施，尽早地求其实现。
    雷任民团长最后说：中日双方还有一个责任，就是按照协定的规定，努力促使两国政府就中日贸易问题尽早进行商谈，并签订协定，以使中日两国贸易关系正常化，使中日两国贸易的可能性能够获得充分的发展。
