    Imperialist Policy of Violence is Bound to Go Bankrupt

    In order to maintain its colonial rule in North Africa, French authorities have recently intensified their suppression of the Algerian people's national independence movement. French troops in Algeria have burned shelters, massacred residents, and used artillery to conduct "sweeps" and "suppression" against guerrilla forces. The French government has also decided to send an additional 40,000 troops to Algeria to strengthen the suppression. The Governor-General of Algeria, Soustelle, even publicly announced that "ruthless and resolute" measures would be taken against the Algerian people participating in the national liberation movement. Every day, many patriots are arrested and killed throughout Algeria. As a result of this bloody policy of suppression by the French authorities, the situation in Algeria and Morocco is becoming increasingly tense.

    The recently concluded Asian-African Conference solemnly declared in its final communiqué the common will of over 1.4 billion Asian and African people: "Colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated swiftly." The communiqué also clearly expressed support for the cause of freedom and independence for the peoples of all colonies, especially the struggle of the Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian people for self-determination and independence; and demanded that the French government facilitate a peaceful resolution to this issue without delay. However, the French colonialists turned a deaf ear to this just call. This cannot but arouse the righteous indignation of all just people. French progressive public opinion has also protested and condemned the French government's terror measures in Algeria.

    The Algerian people have never recognized the colonial system imposed on them by the French colonialists and resolutely demand the restoration of complete independence and freedom. During the Second World War, France promised to satisfy the national demands of the Algerian people, but these promises were not fulfilled after the war.

    Under French colonial rule, the Algerian people have suffered brutal exploitation and enslavement, living in extreme backwardness and poverty. In this area with a population of less than ten million, there are one million unemployed. More than half of the arable land is occupied by French landowners, while 700,000 Algerian farmers have no land. The plight of the Algerian people is so miserable that even an article promoting colonialism in the French bourgeois magazine "Africa and Asia" had to lament: "When an ordinary European or an ordinary Frenchman suddenly faces this tragic situation, if he has a conscience, his first reaction is anger." In recent years, with the infiltration of American forces, wanton plundering of resources, and construction of military bases, the suffering of the Algerian people has become even more profound.

    The Algerian people cannot tolerate this kind of life. On October 31, 1954, they launched armed uprisings in many cities and launched a guerrilla war for independence throughout the country to resist French colonial rule. In order to reduce bloodshed, the Algerian Communist Party suggested to the French government that negotiations be held to establish a democratic republic of Algeria and determine the future relations between the two countries, but this suggestion was rejected by the French government. The French rulers even claimed: "Algeria is French and does not need negotiation." However, the suppressive measures of the French colonialists have not been able to shake the Algerian people's strong will to fight for national independence, and the people's armed struggle continues and expands. As the French newspaper "L'Humanité" pointed out, "The bloodshed in North Africa is proof of the bankruptcy of the policy of suppression."

    While taking "emergency measures" in Algeria, the French government has also adopted the same policy towards the Moroccan people. At the same time, French colonialists are also attempting to use deceptive "autonomy" tricks to divide the Tunisian national independence movement. French Prime Minister Faure recently openly stated that he would rely on American "aid" to implement his colonial policy in North Africa. In fact, the United States has long intensified its intrusion into North Africa. On the one hand, it supports French colonial rule in the United Nations, while on the other hand, it expands American colonial power in the area. They fundamentally refuse to learn from the lessons of Indochina, and they also refuse to recognize the fact that the era in which colonialists can do whatever they want is over. However, the centuries-long history of people's struggle for independence has long proven that the violence of imperialism cannot suppress the desire of the colonial people for independence, and the imperialist policy of violent suppression of the colonial people is bound to go bankrupt.

### 帝国主义暴力政策一定破产

    帝国主义暴力政策一定破产
    法国当局为了维持它在北非的殖民统治，最近正在变本加厉地镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立运动。法国军队在阿尔及利亚焚毁棚舍，捕杀居民，用大炮对游击队进行“扫荡”和“清剿”。法国政府还决定增派四万军队前往阿尔及利亚，以加强镇压行动。阿尔及利亚的总督苏斯戴尔甚至公开宣布，将采取“无情的坚决”措施对付参加民族解放运动的阿尔及利亚人民。在阿尔及利亚各地每天都有许多爱国者遭到逮捕和杀害。由于法国当局的这种血腥镇压政策，阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥的局势变得越来越紧张。
    刚刚结束不久的亚非会议在它的最后公报中曾经庄严地宣布了十四亿以上的亚非人民的共同意志：“殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害”。这个公报并且明白表示支持各殖民地人民的自由和独立的事业，特别是阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯人民争取自决和独立权利的斗争；要求法国政府不迟延地促成这一问题的和平解决。但是法国殖民者对于这种正义的呼声却置若罔闻。这不能不引起全体正义人类的正当的愤慨。法国的进步舆论也纷纷抗议和斥责法国政府在阿尔及利亚的恐怖措施。
    阿尔及利亚人民从来就不承认法国殖民者强加在他们头上的殖民制度，坚决要求恢复完全的独立和自由。第二次世界大战期间，法国曾经答应满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族要求，但是战后这些诺言并未履行。
    在法国的殖民统治下，阿尔及利亚人民受尽了残酷的剥削和奴役，过着极端落后和贫困的生活。在这个不到一千万人口的地方，就有着一百万的失业者。一半以上的耕地为法国的庄园主所霸占，而七十万户阿尔及利亚农民却没有土地。阿尔及利亚人民的境况悲惨到这样的程度，以至法国资产阶级的“非洲与亚洲”杂志登载的一篇宣扬殖民主义的文章也不得不感叹说：“当一个普通的欧洲人或一个普通的法国人突然面临到这
  一悲惨的情况，如果他有良心的话，他的第一个反应就是愤怒。”近年来，由于美国势力渗入，肆意掠夺资源，修筑军事基地，阿尔及利亚人民的苦难就更加深重了。
    阿尔及利亚人民不能忍受这种生活。他们于一九五四年十月三十一日在许多城市中发动了武装起义，并在全国展开了争取独立的游击战争，来反抗法国的殖民统治。为了减少流血，阿尔及利亚共产党曾经向法国政府建议举行谈判，以建立阿尔及利亚民主共和国并确定两国之间未来的关系，这个建议却遭到法国政府的拒绝。法国统治者竟然声称：“阿尔及利亚是法国的，不需要谈判。”但是，法国殖民者的镇压手段并没有能动摇阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的坚强意志，人民的武装斗争在继续进行并不断扩大。正如法国“人道报”所指出的，“北非的流血事件，是镇压政策破产的证明”。
    法国政府在对阿尔及利亚采取“紧急措施”的同时，对摩洛哥人民也采取了同样的政策。同时，法国殖民者还企图用骗人的“自治”把戏来分化突尼斯的民族独立运动。法国总理富尔最近公开表示要依靠美国的“援助”推行它在北非的殖民政策。实际上，美国也早已加紧侵入北非。它一面在联合国内支持法国的殖民统治，同时又在北非扩大美国在当地的殖民势力。他们根本不肯从印度支那吸取教训，他们也拒绝承认殖民主义者可以为所欲为的时代已经过去了的事实。但是，几百年来人民争取独立的胜利历史却早已证明：帝国主义的暴力是压不住殖民地人民要求独立的愿望的，帝国主义对殖民地人民的暴力镇压政策一定破产。
