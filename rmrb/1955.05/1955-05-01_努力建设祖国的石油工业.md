　　Strive to Build the Motherland's Petroleum Industry
　　Yang Zhifan, Chairman of the Yumen Oil Mine Trade Union
    The entire staff of Yumen Oil Mine are celebrating the great "May 1st" International Labor Day with incomparable joy.

    All staff clearly understand that the nation's socialist industrialization and modernization of national defense urgently require large amounts of petroleum. Striving to increase petroleum production for the country is an exceptionally glorious task for petroleum workers. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all staff, in the first quarter of this year, the Yumen Mining Bureau's total output value reached 104.51% of the plan; six products, including gasoline, kerosene, and lubricating oil, overfulfilled the plan; costs were reduced by 11.97%; and profit plans exceeded by 20.24%. The new product, grease, has been successfully trial-produced. The Shihyougou Oilfield, proven to have exploitable value through exploration results, has begun trial extraction. In March, the climate on the Gobi Desert was still very cold, but many basic construction projects had already begun ahead of schedule. Many prospecting and surveying teams from the geological brigade set off for new construction sites to conduct surveys. In several exploration areas, workers successfully drilled two deep exploration wells, obtaining valuable geological data and gaining a further understanding of the geological conditions in these areas.

    In order to ensure the completion of the national plan, the Yumen Oil Mine Trade Union organized all staff to carry out a labor emulation campaign. Most factories and teams signed collective contracts, focusing on promoting the advanced experience of the "Personal Guarantee Competition Chart" from the first workshop of the refinery. In promoting the production area management system, a production post responsibility system and a mass production meeting system at the factory, workshop, and team levels were established, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to solve key production issues. Reasonable suggestions were also encouraged. In the first quarter, the entire mine proposed a total of 575 rationalization proposals, of which 359 were adopted and implemented, saving a value of over 142,000 yuan. Workers in the third team of the first workshop of the refinery, after collective research, suggested changing some of the intermediate oil furnace tubes to crude oil furnace tubes. After this suggestion was adopted, the load on the crude oil furnace tubes was reduced, and two more tons of crude oil were refined per shift, which could increase production by more than 4,000 yuan per year. Han Jinglu, a worker in the water and gas injection team of the oil extraction plant, continuously created the highest record for pumping water injection wells after improving the pumping method. Other teams learned from his advanced experience, and pumping efficiency also generally improved. The First Youth Shock Brigade—the Liu Wenyuan Team—improved its average work efficiency by 57% in March, and also drove the production of other teams.

    In April, all staff in the mine launched a labor emulation campaign to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. They conscientiously implemented the suggestions and operating procedures of Soviet experts, ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the April plan. Refinery workers strengthened inspections in their operations, ensuring the safe operation of equipment. From April 1st, the two main products, gasoline and kerosene, have been consistently overfulfilling the plan every day. Workers at the Jiuquan Drilling Office overfulfilled the first half of the month's plan by 2.6%. Workers in the water and gas injection team of the oil extraction plant completed the April water injection plan for a certain water injection well thirteen days ahead of schedule. Basic construction projects throughout the mine have been fully launched, and the progress of the projects is ahead of schedule. Petroleum workers are using the fruits of their hard work as a precious gift to dedicate to the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

    We are shouldering the arduous task of developing the motherland's petroleum industry, and there are still many difficulties on our path forward. However, we have the determination and strength to overcome these difficulties. On the eve of "May 1st," the First National Oil Extraction Conference was held at the Yumen Oil Mine. This conference discussed the issue of vigorously exploiting China's petroleum resources and formulated and implemented measures to complete the 1955 crude oil production plan. The Yumen Oil Mine Trade Union must mobilize all staff, implement the resolutions of the National Oil Extraction Conference, further develop the labor emulation campaign, work hard to learn and master new technologies, improve and upgrade technologies, increase production, practice strict economy, and unremittingly strive to fully complete and overfulfill this year's national plan!

　　努力建设祖国的石油工业
　　玉门油矿工会主席　杨志范
    玉门油矿全体职工，怀着无比愉快的心情庆祝伟大的“五一”国际劳动节。
    全体职工清楚地懂得：国家社会主义工业化和国防现代化的建设，迫切需要大量的石油，努力为国家增产石油，是石油工人异常光荣的任务。在党的正确领导和全体职工的努力下，今年第一季度玉门矿务局生产总值完成计划百分之一百零四点五一；汽油、煤油、机油等六种产品超额完成了计划，成本降低百分之十一点九七，利润计划超过百分之二十点二四。新产品黄油已经试制成功。经过勘探结果证明具有开采价值的石油沟油田已开始试采。三月份，戈壁滩上气候仍然很冷，但许多基本建设工程已陆续提前开工。地质大队的许多普查队、测量队出发到新工地进行勘察。在几个探区里，工人们钻凿成功了两口深探井，取得了宝贵的地质资料，对这一地区的地质情况有了进一步的了解。
    为了保证完成国家计划，玉门油矿工会组织全体职工开展了劳动竞赛。大部分厂队签订了集体合同，重点推广了炼油厂第一车间“个人保证竞赛图表”的先进经验，在推行生产区域管理制中，建立了生产岗位责任制和厂、车间、小组群众生产会议制，集中群众的智慧来解决生产上的关键问题，并且开展了合理化建议。第一季度全矿共提出合理化建议五百七十五件，采纳执行了三百五十九件，节约价值为十四万二千多元。炼油厂第一车间第三小组工人经过集体研究，建议把一部分中间油炉管改为原油炉管。这个建议被采纳后，减轻了原油炉管的负荷，每班多炼原油两吨，全年可增产四千多元。采油厂注水注气区队工人韩景禄，改进探汲方法后，连续创造了注水井抽汲最高纪录。其他班学习了他的先进经验，抽汲效率也普遍提高了。第一青年突击队——刘文远班，三月份工作效率平均提高了百分之五十七，并带动了其他班组的生产。
    四月份，全矿职工展开了迎接“五一”劳动节的劳动竞赛，他们认真执行苏联专家建议和操作规程，保证完成和超额完成四月份计划。炼油厂职工在操作上加强了检查，保证了设备的安全运转，从四月一日起，汽油、煤油两种主要产品每天都均衡地超额完成计划。酒泉钻探处职工超额百分之二点六完成了上半月计划。采油厂注水注气区队职工在某注水井提前十三天完成了四月份注水计划。全矿基本建设工程已全面开工，工程进度走在计划的前面。石油工人们用自己辛勤劳动的成果，做为献给“五一”国际劳动节的珍贵礼物。
    我们担负着发展祖国石油工业的艰巨任务，在我们前进的道路上还有许多困难，但是，我们有决心和力量克服这些困难。在“五一”节前夕，第一届全国采油会议在玉门油矿举行。这次会议讨论了大力开采我国石油资源的问题，制定和贯彻了完成一九五五年原油生产计划的措施。玉门油矿工会一定要发动全体职工，贯彻全国采油会议的决议，进一步开展劳动竞赛，努力学习和掌握新技术、提高和改进技术，增加生产，厉行节约，为全面完成和超额完成今年的国家计划而不懈地奋斗！
