Produce More Industrial Coal for the Motherland
　　Zhang Wanfu, Head of the Tunneling Team, Second Mine, Datong Mining Bureau
　　An Wenxiu, Head of Coal Cutting Machine Team

    The Datong Coalfield in Shanxi is one of the largest coalfields in our country. This coalfield is buried with extremely rich, high-quality industrial coal and auxiliary coking coal, which is indispensable "grain" for our country's heavy industry construction.

    In the past, under the hands of Yan Xishan, Japanese invaders, and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, the Datong Coal Mine suffered severe damage. In the thirty years before and after, they adopted plundering and destructive mining methods to make more money, abandoning most of the resources underground. When this coal mine returned to the hands of the people in 1949, the mines were filled with sewage, and production in all major mines had stopped. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers began intensive recovery work, draining water, manually mining coal, and tidying up dilapidated machines. In 1950, production began to resume successively, and the backward mining methods of the past were abolished, gradually embarking on the road of mechanized and safe production.

    With the assistance of the Soviet Union, we now widely use coal cutting machines, electric drills, electric winches, endless rope cars, belt conveyors, coal chutes, automatic mine cars, ventilators, water exploration machines, and water pumps. We also use the latest Soviet-style combined coal mining machine—the Donbass Type 1 Combine. With it, there is no need to drill holes and blast, nor to cut grooves; it can mine one ton of coal per minute. As a result of most of the heavy manual labor being replaced by machines, our mine has become a new type of mine with modern technical equipment. By the end of 1954, the degree of mechanization in large mines had reached more than 90 percent. With the increase in the degree of mechanization, output has also increased year by year. The output in 1954 increased by 192.92 percent compared with 1951, and it is estimated that the output in 1955 will increase by more than 320 percent compared with 1951. In 1951, only 21 units used our coal, but in 1954, 297 units used our coal. Seeing the newly built factories of the motherland using our coal, seeing that the coal we produce plays an important role in the socialist industrialization of the motherland, how happy we are! We also see that the development of the motherland's heavy industry directly improves the degree of mechanization of our mines. Now we use Taiyuan-made Soviet-style coal cutting machines underground, which greatly helps our production. We are willing to use our greatest strength to produce more coal to supply more factories, and we also hope that brother factories can help us more. We must also work with brother factories to help our farmer brothers increase agricultural output, and together build our motherland into a great socialist country.

    Speaking of our lives, the Party and the government really care about us so much. Before liberation, we worked for twelve hours a day in places where coal dust and stone chips splashed, and were often beaten and scolded, ate black beans, and drank cold water. Everyone had only one piece of tattered clothing, which they wore to go down the mine and used as a quilt when sleeping. Every day we worried about food and clothing, and no one thought they could have a warm home. At that time, the Japanese army forced us with guns to go down into mines without safety guarantees. Some workers went to mine coal with illnesses, and as a result, they quietly died. Seriously ill workers were simply thrown into the "mass graves." In the past, some people said we were smelly coal miners, but this was all caused by the old society. After liberation, we became the masters of the mine. The Party and the government built thousands of dormitories for us, gave us welfare subsidies, and built hospitals, schools, bathhouses, sanatoriums for lung diseases, amateur resorts, cultural palaces... Our wages have increased, and now every comrade has several sets of clothes, some have even bought watches, and many single men have married and have children. Now, after finishing eight hours of work every day, we take off our work clothes, take a bath, and put on our uniforms, which is very different from the miners before liberation. Who can still say that we are smelly coal miners? When we put on the first set of blue khaki uniforms that we had never worn before, we looked at you, you looked at me, and we all took the insulting name of "smelly coal miner" as a joke. We truly realize that coal miners are only considered human beings in the new society. Thinking of these things, and looking at the comprehensive production reform we are carrying out this year and the mines that are being renovated and newly built, how bright our future is, and how great our responsibility is! After the completion of the first five-year plan, the output of our mine will be more than doubled compared with 1954, and after the new mines are put into production, the output will be more than tripled. By then, we should all learn to master the machines. This is what we feel is the most difficult thing, but we have the confidence to learn to master it.

    On this great "May Day" holiday, we guarantee: in the future, we must follow the instructions of the Party, strive to improve our political consciousness, professional level, and technical level, so that we can become active fighters on the national economic construction front and produce more industrial coal for the motherland.

### 为祖国生产更多的工业用煤

　　为祖国生产更多的工业用煤
　　大同矿务局第二矿掘井组长　张万福

    山西大同煤田，是我国最大的煤田之一。这个煤田埋藏着极为丰富的最好的工业用煤和辅助炼焦煤，这是我国进行重工业建设必不可少的“粮食”。
    过去，在阎锡山、日本侵略者和蒋介石卖国贼的手里，大同煤矿遭受了严重的破坏。他们为了多赚钱，在前后的三十年中都采取了掠夺和破坏性的开采方法，把大部分资源抛弃在地下。这个煤矿在一九四九年回到人民手里时，矿井已积满了污水，所有大矿的生产都停顿了。工人们在党的领导下开始了紧张的恢复工作，一边排水，一边用手工采煤，一边又拾掇了破旧的机器。一九五○年便开始陆续恢复生产，并且废除了过去那种落后的采煤方法，逐渐走上了机械化安全生产的道路。
    在苏联的援助下，现在我们已普遍使用了截煤机、电钻、电绞车、无极绳车、皮带运输机、煤溜子、自动翻矿车、抽风机、探水机、水泵等。我们还使用着苏联最新式的联合采煤机——顿巴斯一型康拜因。用了它，就再不用电钻打眼放炮，也用不着掏槽割根，便能在每分钟内采煤一吨。由于绝大部分笨重的手工劳动都已被机器代替了的结果，我们的矿山已变成了具有现代技术装备的新型矿山。到一九五四年底，大矿采煤机械化程度已达百分之九十以上。随着机械化程度的提高，产量也逐年增加。一九五四年的产量比一九五一年增加了百分之一百九十二点九二，预计一九五五年的产量将比一九五一年增加百分之三百二十以上。一九五一年还只有二十一个单位用我们的煤，到一九五四年就有二百九十七个单位用我们的煤。看到祖国新建成的工厂用了我们的煤，看到自己生产的煤对祖国实现社会主义工业化有着重要的作用，我们的心里多高兴啊！我们更看到，祖国重工业的发展，也直接使我们的矿山提高了机械化的程度，现在我们在井下就使用着太原造的苏式截煤机，对我们的生产帮助很大。我们愿意用最大的力量生产出更多的煤来供给更多的工厂，也希望兄弟工厂能多帮助我们。我们还要同兄弟厂共同来帮助农民兄弟提高农业产量，同他们一起把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    说到我们的生活，党和政府真是太关心我们了。解放前，我们每天在煤粉和石渣飞溅的地方工作达十二小时，还经常挨打受骂、吃黑豆、喝凉水，每个人只有一身破衣裳，下井穿它，睡觉还用它当被子，每天愁吃愁穿，谁也没有想过能有个温暖的家。那时日本军队用枪逼着我们下到没有安全保障的矿井里，有的工人带着病去挖煤，结果就悄悄地死去了。病重的工人干脆就被他们扔到“万人坑”里去。从前有人说我们是臭煤黑子，其实这都是旧社会造成的。解放后，我们成了矿山的主人，党和政府给我们建筑了几千间宿舍，给了我们福利补助金，还修建了医院、学校、澡塘、肺病疗养院、业余休养所、文化宫……。我们的工资增加了，现在无论哪个同志都有几身衣服，有的还买了手表，许多单身汉结了婚、有了孩子。我们现在每天做完了八小时的工作，脱下工作服洗个澡，穿上了制服，和解放前的矿工大不相同了，谁还能说我们是臭煤黑子呢？当我们穿上第一套从来没穿过的蓝卡叽制服时，你看看我，我瞅瞅你，都拿“臭煤黑子”那个侮辱人的称呼当笑话了。我们真正体会到煤矿工人只有在新社会里才算是人。想起这些，再看看我们今年正在进行的全面的生产改革和正在改建和新建的矿井，我们的前途是多么的光明，我们的责任是多么重大啊！到第一个五年计划完成后，我们矿山的产量将比一九五四年提高一倍以上，到新建矿井投入生产后，产量又将提高两倍以上。到那时，我们都应该学会掌握机器。这是我们感到最困难的事，但是我们有信心学会掌握它。
    在这伟大的“五一”节日，我们保证：今后一定要遵照党的指示，努力提高政治觉悟、业务水平和技术水平，使自己成为国家经济建设战线上的积极战士，为祖国生产更多的工业用煤。
