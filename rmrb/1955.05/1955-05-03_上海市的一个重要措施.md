Shanghai Liberation Daily News: From April 1st to 19th, Shanghai has mobilized 12,414 farmers who flowed into the city to return to their hometowns to participate in production, and has successively mobilized a group of construction workers and car drivers to support inland construction. These measures are very correct and timely.

With the development of national construction in various fields, the population moving from rural areas to cities, especially industrial and mining areas, will inevitably increase accordingly. However, this increase in population must not be blind. But now there are just some blind people who hope for cities with more and more population, cities that are bigger and bigger; or they only seek the convenience of their own departments, blindly attracting farmers to the city. As for the consequences of too many urban residents, no one considers them. Thus, from the perspective of urban planning, some cities could have avoided or reduced population growth, but for the sake of the so-called "socialist prospects," they readily make plans for millions or even millions of people. From the perspective of recruitment by government agencies and enterprises, some jobs could have been done by local residents, but they have to go to the countryside to mobilize young people, believing that only rural youth are pure and reliable. Even some cadres in Beijing, when employing nannies, have to recruit them from Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

When cities become large, the consequences are very bad: first of all, the construction cost of large cities is high, and the maintenance cost is high. The average annual urban maintenance cost per person in Beijing is more than twice as high as that in Harbin. And to build large cities, many old buildings have to be demolished and destroyed. These are all great wastes. Secondly, when the population is concentrated, supplies become difficult. Eggs in Beijing sometimes have to be transported from south of the Yangtze River; pork and vegetables often have to be purchased from hundreds of miles away. In order to ensure the normal life of the urban people, the larger the city, the greater the number of service personnel. At present, in cities with a population of more than 300,000 in our country, service population accounts for about 23% to 25%, while in small cities, the service population only accounts for 18% to 20%. It can be seen that there is also a lot of waste of manpower in large cities.

At present, not only should we quickly stop the phenomenon of blindly increasing the urban population, but we should also mobilize the people of large cities to leave the cities to participate in other aspects of work in a planned and step-by-step manner. For example, in the interior of our motherland, a great socialist construction is underway; in the vast rural areas, the production and mutual aid and cooperation movement is also developing vigorously. These undertakings require a lot of funds and a lot of manpower. Mobilizing people with culture, technology, and work experience in large cities to participate in industrial and agricultural construction in the interior, and mobilizing farmers who blindly flow into the cities to return to their hometowns to produce, can not only reduce the difficulties of large cities and increase the strength of industrial and agricultural construction, but also ensure the reliable life of these people.

Shanghai's mobilization of more than 10,000 farmers to return to their hometowns for production is a good start. Shanghai and other large cities should continue to mobilize personnel from various aspects to go to different posts in other regions. The people of major cities should obey the country's plans and actively participate in inland construction and agricultural production. The people of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas should also consciously stop flowing to large cities.

    上海市的一个重要措施
　　王朴
    上海解放日报消息：从四月一日到十九日，上海市已动员了一万二千四百一十四名流入城市的农民回乡参加生产并先后动员了一批建筑工人和汽车司机支援内地建设。这些措施，是十分正确的、适时的。
    随着国家各方面建设事业的发展，由农村走向城市、特别是工矿区的人口必然会相应地增加。但是，这种人口的增加必须不是盲目的。可是现在恰恰有这样一些盲目的人，希望人口越来越多的、大了还要更大的城市；或者只图本部门的方便，盲目吸引农民到城市来。至于因城市人口太多所造成的后果如何，谁也不去考虑。于是，从城市计划来看，有些城市本来可以不增加或少增加一些人口的，但是为了所谓的“社会主义远景”，也动辄作出百万、数百万人口的规划。从机关和企业用人来看，有些工作本来可以吸收本市居民来做的，也非到农村去动员青年不可，认为只有农村青年是纯洁可靠的。甚至如北京市某些干部使用保姆，也要到苏浙一带去招雇。
    城市大了，后果是很不好的：首先是大城市的建筑造价高，维护费用大，北京市平均每人每年的城市维护费用，就比哈尔滨高两倍多。而要建筑大城市，还得拆毁和破坏很多旧的建筑。这都是很大的浪费。其次，人口集中了，供应也就困难了。北京市的鸡蛋，有的要从长江以南运来；猪肉、蔬菜，也往往要到几百里以外去采办。为了保证城市人民的正常生活，城市越大，服务人口的数量也就越多。目前我国三十万人口以上的城市，服务性人口约占百分之二十三至二十五，而小城市的服务性人口只占百分之十八至二十。可见大城市的人力也有很多浪费。
    目前，不只应该迅速停止盲目增加城市人口的现象，还应该有计划有步骤地动员大城市的人民离开城市去参加其他方面的工作。例如在我们祖国的内地，正在进行伟大的社会主义建设；在广大的农村，生产和互助合作运动也正蓬蓬勃勃地发展。这些事业，既需要大量的资金，也需要大量的人力。动员大城市里有文化、有技术、有工作经验的人员去参加内地的工农业建设，动员盲目流入城市的农民回乡生产，既可减少大城市的困难，增加工农业建设的力量，也可以使这些人的生活得到可靠的保证。
    上海市动员了一万多农民回乡生产，这是一个很好的开端。上海和其他大城市，都应该继续动员各方面的人员到其他地区的不同的岗位上去。各大城市的人民，应该服从国家的计划，积极参加内地建设和农业生产。各中小城市和农村的人民，也应该自觉地停止向大城市流动。
