　  Construction Begins on Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory
    Construction of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory officially began on May 16th. In the construction of this factory, 60 percent of the work will be carried out using prefabricated and mechanized methods. Building beams, columns, and various reinforced concrete components will all be prefabricated and installed.
    The high-speed warping machines to be installed in this factory will have automatic stop devices for yarn breakage and full bobbin. The yarn winding speed will be more than twice as fast as the semi-high-speed warping machines in the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory. The spindles of the spinning machines will be converted to ball bearings, which will facilitate high-speed machine operation, reduce yarn breakage, and also save 8 percent of electricity consumption. After completion, this factory will mainly produce plain cloth, fine cloth, and sateen drill and serge.

　  郑州第四棉纺织厂开工兴建
    国营郑州第四棉纺织厂在五月十六日正式开工兴建。这个厂的建设工程，有百分之六十是采用工厂化和机械化施工。厂房梁柱等各种钢筋混凝土构件都采取预制安装办法。
    这个厂将来安装的高速整经机上有断头、满码自动停车装置；卷纱速度比国营郑州第三棉纺织厂的半高速整经机高两倍多；细纱机锭子将改用滚珠轴承，便于机器高速度的运转，减少棉纱断头，同时还可节约百分之八的用电。这个厂建成后，主要生产市布、细布和纱直贡、纱哔叽。
