　　U.S. Intervention in South Vietnam's Internal Affairs
　　Li Gao
　　While the people of North Vietnam, under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are living and working in peace to restore and develop peaceful construction, the situation in South Vietnam has fallen into serious chaos. The struggle for power among various factions has recently developed into armed conflict, causing the people of South Vietnam to suffer from the scourge of war once again. This is the direct result of U.S. intervention in the situation in Vietnam. The infighting between Ngo Dinh Diem's group's army and the sectarian armies in the Saigon and Cholon areas was instigated by Washington.

　　Since the Geneva Conference, the United States has been intensifying its intervention in the situation in Vietnam. International News Service reported from Washington on May 2nd: "U.S. policy in Vietnam was drafted by Cardinal Spellman of the New York Catholic Diocese." According to this policy, Ngo Dinh Diem was placed in South Vietnam by the United States to act as the U.S. agent in controlling South Vietnam. The United States acted recklessly in South Vietnam, directing Ngo Dinh Diem to eliminate dissidents, attempting to establish a Syngman Rhee-style dictatorial reign of terror in South Vietnam, in order to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords, undermine peace in Indochina, and at the same time, gradually squeeze out French influence and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony. The recent infighting in Saigon was triggered by Ngo Dinh Diem's attempt to annex various religious sects.

　　Ngo Dinh Diem was completely unpopular from the beginning, but the American colonialists issued orders, forcing this Washington agent upon the people of South Vietnam. Last November, the United States specially sent General Collins as a presidential envoy to be stationed in Saigon to support Ngo Dinh Diem. He has in fact become the supreme emperor of South Vietnam. The "Figaro" in Paris said that the current "final decision" on the situation in South Vietnam is not made by Bao Dai or Ngo Dinh Diem, but by Collins.

　　On March 8th this year, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly declared that the United States would support Ngo Dinh Diem in establishing his "loyal military force," while accusing various religious sects in South Vietnam of being not "loyal" to Ngo Dinh Diem. Subsequently, Ngo Dinh Diem announced the adoption of military means to "resolutely suppress" the resistance of various religious sects. Washington officials "warmly welcomed" the news of the fighting from Saigon. This is a blatant manifestation of the U.S. colonialists' intervention in South Vietnam. A few days ago, when the situation in Saigon was very tense and Paris also expressed dissatisfaction with Ngo Dinh Diem, Washington repeatedly stated that it could not do without Ngo Dinh Diem. It also put pressure on the French government, Bao Dai, and religious sects opposed to Ngo Dinh Diem in Paris, Cannes, and Saigon. Washington's State Department officials even openly threatened with "stopping aid." After Collins returned to Saigon last week from Washington for instructions, Ngo Dinh Diem launched intensive activities, setting up a so-called "Revolutionary Committee" to further implement his dictatorship. According to Reuters, Collins also announced to American reporters that his plan was to establish a "constitutional monarchy." Now Saigon is holding a so-called "National Congress" to support Ngo Dinh Diem.

　　While the United States is manipulating the situation in South Vietnam in this way, the State Department spokesman brazenly lied, saying: "It is entirely up to the Vietnamese themselves to solve their own problems and decide on their own form of government." From the recent chaos and bloodshed in South Vietnam, the people of Asia have once again seen that where there is intervention by U.S. colonialists, there is chaos and disaster. The "subversion," "infiltration," and "intervention" that the U.S. aggressive bloc constantly clamors about are precisely the portrayal of the U.S.'s own international behavior.

　　France is playing an unenviable "partner" role in South Vietnam. The French ruling clique has always adopted a policy of gradually yielding to the United States. French Prime Minister Faure slightly expressed his dissatisfaction with Ngo Dinh Diem on April 29th and received a "strong protest" from the United States. By May 3rd, he had changed his tune, emphasizing "friendship" with the United States. The result of the French government's policy of submission is that the United States is intensifying its offensive, taking an inch and wanting a mile.

　　The United States' blatant intervention in the situation in South Vietnam, supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem group, is a conspiratorial step to intensify its sabotage of the Geneva Accords, especially the undermining of the democratic general election in Vietnam. An editorial in the British "Times" on April 28th pointed out that this action by the United States is "primarily anxious" to keep South Vietnam's "hostility" towards North Vietnam "going," turning South Vietnam into a anti-communist "barrier." French Prime Minister Faure also said in the National Assembly on May 3rd that the riots in South Vietnam constituted a "temptation to avoid holding elections." This is precisely why this intervention conspiracy by the United States is attracting close attention from countries concerned about peace in Indochina, which is entirely understandable. The Vietnam National United Front issued a statement on May 2nd, calling on patriotic and peaceful forces in South Vietnam to unite closely, oppose the intervention of U.S. imperialism, and fight to uphold the Geneva Accords. This is not only the just call of the Vietnamese people, but also the demand of the people of the world.

### 美国干涉南越内政

　　美国干涉南越内政
　　李高
    当越南北部的人民在越南民主共和国政府领导下安居乐业地恢复和发展和平建设的时候，南越的局势却发生了严重的混乱；各派系势力争权夺利的斗争最近发展为武装冲突，使得南越的人民重又蒙受战祸。这是美国干涉越南局势的直接结果。吴庭艳集团军队和教派军队在西贡、堤岸地区发生的混战，就是华盛顿一手挑起的。
    日内瓦会议以来，美国一直加紧干涉越南局势。国际新闻社华盛顿二日消息报道说：“美国在越南的政策是由纽约天主教区的红衣主教史培尔曼拟就的。”根据这种政策，吴庭艳便被美国一手安置在南越，作为美国控制南越的代理人。美国在南越横行无忌，指使吴庭艳铲除异己，企图在南越建立李承晚式的恐怖独裁统治，以便阻挠日内瓦协议的实施，破坏印度支那的和平，同时逐步排挤法国势力，把南越变成美国的殖民地。最近西贡的混战就是由于吴庭艳要吞并各教派而触发的。
    吴庭艳从开始就完全不得人心，但是美国殖民主义者发号施令，硬把这个华盛顿的代理人加在南越人民之上。去年十一月，美国专门派了柯林斯将军以总统特使身份常驻西贡，为吴庭艳撑腰。他实际上已成为南越的太上皇。巴黎的“费加罗报”就说，目前“最后决定”南越事态的不是保大也不是吴庭艳，而是柯林斯。
    今年三月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开声明美国要支持吴庭艳建立他的“忠诚的军事力量”，同时指责南越各教派对吴庭艳不“忠顺”。接着，吴庭艳就宣布采取军事手段“断然镇压”各教派的反抗。华盛顿官员对西贡传来的厮杀消息，“表示热烈欢迎”。这是美国殖民主义者干涉南越的露骨表现。前几天，当西贡形势非常紧张，而且巴黎方面对吴庭艳也表示不满的时候，华盛顿接二连三地表示非吴庭艳不行。它并且在巴黎、戛纳、西贡对法国政府、保大和反对吴庭艳的教派加施压力。华盛顿的国务院官员还公开以“停止援助”进行胁迫。在柯林斯于上周从华盛顿请示回到西贡之后，吴庭艳就展开了紧张的活动，搞什么“革命委员会”来进一步实行独裁。据路透社报道，柯林斯还向美国记者宣布他的计划是要建立一个“君主立宪政体”。现在西贡正在举行所谓“国民大会”，来为吴庭艳捧场。
    美国这样一手操纵南越局势，国务院发言人还老着脸皮撒谎说：“完全要由越南人自己来解决他们自己的问题和决定他们自己的政府形式。”从南越最近发生的混乱和流血中，亚洲人民又一次看到，那里有美国殖民主义者的干涉，那里就有混乱和灾难。美国侵略集团经常叫嚣的“颠覆”、“渗透”和“干涉”，正就是美国自己的国际行为的写照。
    法国在南越充当着一个不值得羡慕的“伙伴”角色。法国统治集团一向采取步步屈从美国的政策。法国总理富尔在四月二十九日略微表示了一下对吴庭艳的不满，就接到美国的“强硬抗议”。到五月三日他就改了口气，强调对美国的“友谊”。法国政府这种屈从政策的结果，是美国得寸进尺地加紧进攻。
    美国这样赤裸裸地干涉南越局势，支持吴庭艳集团，是它加紧破坏日内瓦协议，特别是破坏越南民主普选的一个阴谋步骤。英国“泰晤士报”四月二十八日的社论就指出：美国这种作为是“首先急于”使南越对北越的“敌对保持下去”，使南越变成反共的“障壁”。法国总理富尔五月三日在国民议会中也说，南越的骚乱已构成一种“避免举行选举的诱惑”。正是这样，所以美国这个干涉阴谋，正在引起关心印度支那和平的国家的密切注视，这是完全可以理解的。越南国民联合战线在五月二日发表声明，号召越南南部爱国和和平的力量，密切团结起来，反对美帝国主义者的干涉，为维护日内瓦协定而进行斗争。这不仅是越南人民的正义呼声，也是全世界人民的要求。
