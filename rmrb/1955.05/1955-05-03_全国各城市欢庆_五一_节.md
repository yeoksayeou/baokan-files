Guangzhou City

On May 1st, over 80,000 people in Guangzhou gathered to celebrate International Labor Day. Celebrations were held in different districts, with the central venue for over 40,000 people located at the Yuexiu Mountain People's Stadium. From 4:00 AM, Guangzhou was already bustling. Crowds holding flowers poured towards various venues from all directions. Yuexiu Mountain was packed with people, and flags were like a forest. Buildings along both banks of the Pearl River and small boats and ships in the river also raised bright red flags.

The celebration began at 9:00 AM. Tao Zhu, Acting Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's South China Sub-bureau and Governor of Guangdong Province, spoke at the meeting. He said that celebrating International Labor Day today makes us realize that in the past year, the international peace forces, with the peace, democracy, and socialist camp as the mainstay, including the sympathy and support of people from all countries in the world, have achieved many significant accomplishments in the struggle for and defense of peace. The recently held Asian-African Conference and its achievements reflect the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa to safeguard world peace, strive for and maintain national independence, and promote friendly cooperation between countries. We celebrate the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and are willing to work together with the people of Asia and Africa to realize the various contents of the Asian-African Conference Communiqué. Labor model Gu Yuansong, captain of the "South China 163" ship, and agricultural labor model Xie Zhonghan also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to do their practical work well and contribute their utmost strength to the peace of the Far East and the world, to the construction of the motherland, and to the liberation of Taiwan.

The assembly concluded with a parade.

In the evening, a celebration was held at the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace for more than 30,000 people.

Anshan City

Over 110,000 working people in the steel capital of Anshan held a rally and parade in the rain on May 1st to celebrate International Labor Day.

In the early morning, the five-star red flag and various colorful flags were hung on many tall buildings on the streets. Streams of colorful people converged from factories and schools on the roads leading to the city center. Labor models with shining gold medals on their chests and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves walked towards the assembly venue together.

The first to arrive at the venue were the workers from Anshan Iron and Steel Company. In the ranks of the steelworkers, countless award flags fluttered in the wind. In the first quarter of this year, they produced more than 3,600 tons of steel for the country. In the labor competition launched in April to welcome "May Day," there were 158 heats of rapid steelmaking within 28 days, overfulfilling the production task. Ironworkers carried a huge banner reading "Produce more high-quality iron to support the liberation of Taiwan" into the venue, expressing their intention to produce more pig iron this year to support the liberation of Taiwan. Anshan Iron and Steel Company employees plan to increase production value by 22% compared to 1954 and produce an additional 36.6 million yuan worth of wealth this year.

The builders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company – the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company – entered the venue. Their labor is changing the face of the steel capital day by day. They have built many new factories and millions of square meters of worker housing, clubs, and other employee welfare facilities. In the second quarter of this year, an average of one project will be completed every two and a half days.

At about 9:00 AM, the celebration began. Soviet and Czechoslovak experts who are helping Anshan Iron and Steel with production and construction were invited to attend the ceremony. Han Tianshi, Secretary of the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee, spoke at the meeting. He called on all employees and people from all walks of life in the city to work diligently, overcome difficulties, practice strict economy, increase production, and strive to realize socialist industrialization, support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace.

He said that after the Soviet troops leave, we must cooperate with the Chinese People's Liberation Army to continue to defend the Lushunkou naval base, making it as solid as a rock, capable of repelling any aggressor.
