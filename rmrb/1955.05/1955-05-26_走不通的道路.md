　　The British general election is getting closer and closer. The Conservatives are heavily touting their "achievements" during their tenure in the election campaign, asking voters to cast another vote for the Conservatives to remain in power!
　　Indeed, after three years and six months in power, it is time to draw conclusions about what the Conservative Party has brought to Britain. When the Conservative Party came to power, Britain faced a difficult situation. At that time, Britain followed the United States in participating in the war of aggression against Korea, and the national economy began to shift to a track of large-scale expansion of armaments and war preparation. Arms production swallowed up most of the raw materials and a large amount of labor. However, civil industries still had not escaped the post-war depression, unemployment soared, foreign exchange reserves dwindled sharply, and the fiscal deficit continued to expand. The British Empire's rule overseas was on the verge of collapse: in the Near and Middle East, it encountered the impact of the Iranian and Egyptian people's movements for national independence, and was also squeezed out by the United States; in the Far East, due to its participation in the Korean War, British policy was increasingly subordinate to the United States, and two autonomous territories—Australia and New Zealand—threw themselves into the arms of the United States, and concluded military alliances with the United States, excluding Britain. In Europe, the United States actively advocated the revival of West German militarism and supported West German monopoly capital. The power of West Germany has increasingly become a threat to Britain. At that time, clear-headed public opinion in Britain had already pointed out that Britain must get rid of the shackles of the US war and aggression policies, pursue an independent policy in line with its own interests, in order to ease the international situation, stabilize the economic situation and improve people's lives. At this time, the Conservative Party dramatically proposed direct negotiations with the Soviet Union, the convening of a conference of major powers and other propositions to cater to the demands of the people. However, after the Conservative Party came to power, the facts were just the opposite. The Conservative Party not only did not intend to change this policy that violated the will of the British people and damaged the national interests of Britain, but instead intensified its efforts to follow the United States in preparing for war and carrying out aggression, and promoted the so-called "policy of strength," which worsened the international situation and further damaged British interests.
　　Under the guidance of the "policy of strength" ideology, the British Conservative government followed the United States in establishing military aggression blocs all over the world and stepped up arms expansion and war preparation. The Conservative government actively implemented the policy of rearming West Germany, signed the notorious Paris Agreement and abandoned the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which was a guarantee of British security. Under the cover of this agreement, German militarist forces have openly begun to rebuild their aggressive army, greatly increasing the danger of a new war. In the Far East, Britain is a major member of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc pieced together by the United States. With the support of Britain, the United States is wantonly carrying out aggression and war activities against China and other regions of Asia. These activities have deepened the tensions in Southeast Asia and the Far East. In the Near and Middle East, Britain and the United States are working together to establish a Middle East aggressive bloc. For this purpose, Britain also participated in the Turkish-Iraqi Pact. According to the
"position of strength" policy, the Conservative government has stepped up the expansion of armaments, extended the term of military service, continuously increased military spending year after year, and openly decided to manufacture hydrogen bombs and promote the so-called "deterrence" policy.
　　Under this policy of the Conservative government, Britain's security is being seriously threatened by West German militarism, and even the British mainland is in danger of becoming a base for the United States to launch atomic warfare. The British Empire continues to disintegrate, and its overseas positions are being broken through one after another by the United States. American influence has further penetrated into the British Empire's autonomous territories and colonies in Southeast Asia. Britain's position in the Near and Middle East is also constantly declining. The United States' ousting of British influence in Iran was completed during the years when the Conservative Party was in power. The United States' oil production in the Near and Middle East has greatly surpassed that of Britain and occupies a controlling position. As a result of the Conservative government's militarization of the national economy, Britain's industrial production has developed abnormally. Although the overall index has increased in three years, the factors of crisis have deepened. Since the second half of last year, the British economy has begun to deteriorate again. The policy of arms expansion and war preparation has also brought new disasters to the British people. The British people are suffering from high prices and bearing heavy military expenses. During the three years of the Conservative Party's rule (1952-1954), Britain spent 4.5 billion pounds on military expenses, averaging about 90 pounds per British person. This heavy burden is arousing a wave of strikes by British dockworkers and other industrial workers.
　　The Conservative Party's policies have aroused great dissatisfaction among the British people. The masses of the people are particularly dissatisfied with the decision to manufacture hydrogen bombs and the approval and implementation of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, calls for the formulation of a peaceful policy and the easing of international tensions have been issued throughout the country. The annual meeting of the National Union of Mineworkers in the Central Region, the annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the annual meeting of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, the annual meeting of the Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association, and the annual meeting of the National Cooperative Union, all held in April, passed resolutions condemning the policy of manufacturing hydrogen bombs and rearming West Germany, and demanding the holding of great power negotiations to eliminate the danger of war.
　　These situations fully illustrate that the Conservative Party's road is an impassable road.
　　It is precisely for this reason that the Conservative Party is heavily promoting great power talks and easing international tensions in this election campaign. People know that during the three and a half years of the Conservative Party's rule, it has more than once played the tune of holding negotiations with the Soviet Union. However, in reality, the Conservatives always accepted the pressure of the United States, delayed the holding of great power negotiations, and actively made various decisions that harmed international peace together with the United States. Commentators in some British newspapers also mentioned that not long ago there was news that Eden had adopted a negative attitude towards the proposal of "high-level" talks. Now that the election period is approaching, Eden and his Foreign Secretary Macmillan are both showing enthusiasm for such talks. Western newspapers pointed out that the reason why the Conservative Party is now actively advocating a meeting of the heads of the four major powers is that they hope that by proposing such a proposition that is very popular with the masses, they can win votes in the election and defeat their opponent, the Labour Party.
　　The Conservative Party alarmingly titled their election program "United to Strive for Peace and Progress," while also heavily promoting their "policy of strength" and "deterrence" policy, trying to portray this policy as a necessary factor leading to peace. They insisted that rearming West Germany is an "obstacle to preventing aggression." Although it is well known that the resurgence of German militarism will only greatly increase the danger of it launching new aggression in Europe. Moreover, this policy of rebuilding the Hitler Wehrmacht is directly opposed to the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries. Promoting this policy will not only fail to improve international relations, but will only worsen international relations. For Britain, the abolition of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is the result of Britain's implementation of this policy. On the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the Conservatives declared on the one hand that they were in favor of easing tensions and disarmament, but at the same time they advocated that Britain must manufacture hydrogen bombs for this purpose. Eden said in his election speech that only when Britain has the "power of retaliation" can it be hoped to reduce the danger of war, and therefore Britain should produce hydrogen weapons. In this way, the Conservative Party proved that it is still insisting on taking a road that will not work.
　　It should be pointed out that although the British Labour Party is fiercely competing with the Conservative Party, it cannot put forward a program that is fundamentally different from the Conservative Party. The Labour Party attacks the Conservative Party for raising prices and increasing taxes, but it is unwilling to expose the real root of this scourge. Everyone knows that the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party also advocated a "position of strength" policy, supported the Paris Agreement on rearming West Germany, and supported the decision to manufacture hydrogen bombs. It is precisely because of this that the Labour Party is trying its best to avoid the most acute issue of current concern to the British people—peace or atomic war—in the election campaign, in order to conceal the fact that they agree with the Conservative Party on the most important diplomatic issues.
　　Therefore, whether it is the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, they cannot arouse the interest of British voters in the election campaign. Voters hope to get answers from the candidates on the issues of peace, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and disarmament, but they cannot get such answers from the Conservative Party and the Labour Party's election programs. In this situation, the 35 million voters in Britain are very indifferent to this election campaign, and even Reuters calls this general election "the most dull and lifeless election campaign of this century."
　　The British people have become increasingly clear about what their true interests are. The demands put forward by the progressive forces in Britain are: do not produce hydrogen bombs, but ban atomic weapons and disarm; do not arm West Germany, but establish a European collective security system and a unified, peaceful and democratic Germany; withdraw American troops from Britain, and Britain becomes a free and independent country. They are launching a struggle to bring about a real change in British policy that conforms to the national interests of Britain. Regardless of the outcome of this election, if the British rulers continue to pursue their "policy of strength" that endangers the national interests of Britain, they cannot but be met with the growing resistance of the British people.

　　走不通的道路

    英国大选的日子，愈来愈近了。保守党人在竞选中大事吹嘘他们执政期间的“政绩”，要求选民为保守党的继续当权再投一票！
    的确，保守党在它执政的三年六个月中，究竟为英国带来了什么，现在已经到了可以作出结论的时候了。在保守党上台的时候，英国面临着一个艰难的局面。当时英国追随美国参加了侵略朝鲜的战争，国民经济开始转上大规模扩军备战的轨道，军火生产吞没了大部分的原料和大量的劳动力。但是，民用工业仍没有从战后萧条的状况中摆脱出来，失业数字激增，外汇储备急剧枯竭，财政赤字日益扩大。英帝国在海外的统治摇摇欲坠：在中近东，它遇到了伊朗和埃及人民争取民族独立运动的冲激，同时并受到美国的排挤；在远东，由于参加了朝鲜战争，英国的政策日益屈从于美国，两个自治领——澳大利亚和新西兰——投入了美国的怀抱，在排斥英国的情况下，同美国缔结了军事同盟。在欧洲，美国积极主张复活西德军国主义，扶植西德垄断资本。西德的势力已日益成为对英国的威胁。在当时英国的清醒的舆论已经指出，英国必须摆脱美国战争政策和侵略政策的束缚，奉行符合本国利益的独立政策，以缓和国际局势，稳定经济情况和改善人民生活。这时候，保守党戏剧性地提出了要同苏联直接谈判，要召开大国会议等主张来投合人民的要求。但是，等到保守党上台之后，事实恰恰相反。保守党不仅丝毫不打算改变这种违背英国人民意志、损害英国民族利益的政策，反而变本加厉地追随美国准备战争和进行侵略，推行所谓“实力政策”，这种政策使国际局势恶化，使英国的利益进一步受到损害。
    在“实力政策”思想的指导下，英国保守党政府追随美国在世界各处建立军事侵略集团，加紧扩军备战。保守党政府积极执行重新武装西德的政策，签订了臭名昭著的巴黎协定而背弃了成为英国安全的保障的英苏条约。德国军国主义势力已在这个协定的掩护下，公然开始重建其侵略军队，使新战争的危险大大增加起来。在远东，英国是美国拼凑的东南亚侵略集团的主要成员，在英国的支持下，美国对中国和亚洲其他地区放肆地进行侵略和战争活动，这些活动加深了东南亚和远东地区的紧张局势。在中近东，英国和美国一道力图建立中东侵略集团，为此目的，英国并参加了土伊协定。按照
  “实力地位”政策，保守党政府加紧扩充军备，延长兵役期限，连年不断增加军事开支，并且公然决定制造氢弹，宣传所谓“威慑”政策。
    在保守党政府的这种政策下，英国的安全正受到西德军国主义的严重威胁，甚至英国本土也有沦为美国发动原子战争的基地的危险。英帝国在继续瓦解中，它在海外的阵地一个接着一个被美国所攻破。美国势力已进一步渗入英帝国在东南亚的自治领和殖民地中。英国在中近东的地位也在不断衰落。美国在伊朗把英国势力排挤出去，就是在保守党当政的年代中完成的。美国在中近东地区的石油开采量，已大大地超越了英国，而居于控制的地位。保守党政府使国民经济军事化的结果，英国的工业生产畸形发展，在三年中总指数虽有提高，但是危机的因素是加深了。自去年下半年起，英国经济就又开始恶化了。扩军备战的政策也为英国人民带来了新的灾难。英国人民经受着物价高涨的痛苦，担负着沉重的军事费用。在保守党当政的三年（一九五二—一九五四）中，英国花费了四十五亿英镑的军费，平均每个英国人要负担约九十英镑。这种沉重负担正在激起英国码头工人和其他业工人的罢工怒潮。
    保守党的政策在英国人民中间引起了非常不满的情绪。人民群众对于制造氢弹的决定和巴黎协定的批准和实施特别不满。因此，全国各地发出了要求制定和平政策和缓和国际紧张局势的呼声。四月份举行的中央地区的全国矿工联盟的年会、苏格兰职工大会年会、店员与送货工人联合会年会、机器制造和造船业绘图员工会年会以及全国合作社工会年会都曾通过决议谴责制造氢弹和重新武装西德的政策，要求举行大国谈判、消除战争危险。
    这些情形充分说明了保守党的道路是走不通的道路。
    正是由于这种缘故，保守党在这次竞选中大事宣传大国会谈和缓和国际局势。人们知道，在保守党当政的三年半中，曾不止一次地高弹同苏联举行谈判的曲调。但是，实际上保守党人却总是接受美国的压力，拖延举行大国谈判，而积极地和美国一起作出种种危害国际和平的决定。某些英国报纸的评论员也提到，不久前还有消息说明艾登对“高级”会谈的主张采取否定态度。现在大选期近了，艾登和他的外交大臣麦克米伦都对这种会谈表示热心起来。西方国家的报纸指出：保守党现在之所以积极主张四大国首脑会谈，是由于他们指望提出群众非常欢迎的这种主张，就可以在选举中赢得选票，可以击败他们的对手工党。
    保守党人把他们的竞选纲领耸人听闻地冠以“团结起来争取和平和进步”的题目，同时又大事宣扬其“实力政策”和“威慑”政策，力图把这种政策说成是导致和平的必要因素。他们硬说重新武装西德是“防止侵略的障碍”。虽然人所共知，德国军国主义的再起，只有大大增加它在欧洲发动新侵略的危险。而且这种重建希特勒国防军的政策，是直接反对苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的。推行这种政策不但不能改善国际关系，而且只能使国际关系恶化。对英国来说，英苏条约的被废除，就是英国执行这种政策的结果。在关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题上，保守党人一面宣称他们赞成缓和紧张局势，裁减军备，但同时又主张为此英国必须制造氢弹。艾登在他的竞选演说中就说，只有当英国具有“报复的力量”，才可以希望减少战争危险，因此英国应当生产氢武器。这样，保守党就证明自己还坚持走一条走不通的道路。
      应该指出，英国工党虽然和保守党激烈地进行竞选，却提不出一个和保守党有原则区别的纲领。工党攻击保守党使物价上涨，捐税增加，但它又不愿揭露造成这种祸害的真正根源。大家知道，工党的右翼领袖同样鼓吹“实力地位”政策，支持重新武装西德的巴黎协定，支持制造氢弹的决定。正是因为这样，工党在竞选中竭力回避英国人民关心的当前最尖锐的问题——和平还是原子战争——，以掩饰他们在最重要的外交问题上和保守党一致的这一事实。
    因此，不论是保守党也好，或者是工党也好，它们在竞选中都不能引起英国选民的兴趣。选民们希望从候选人那里得到关于和平问题、禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备问题的答复，但是他们从保守党和工党的竞选纲领中得不到这种答复。在这种情况下，英国的三千五百万选民对这次竞选运动十分冷淡，甚至路透社把这次大选叫做“这个世纪里最乏味和最没有生气的竞选运动”。
    英国人民已日益明了什么是他们的真正利益。英国的进步力量提出的要求是：不要生产氢弹，而要禁止原子武器和裁减军备；不要武装西德，而要建立欧洲集体安全体系和一个统一的和平民主的德国；从英国撤退美国军队，英国成为自由和独立的国家。他们正在展开斗争，要使英国政策产生符合于英国的民族利益的真正改变。不管这次选举的结果如何，英国的当政者如果继续奉行其危害英国民族利益的“实力政策”，他们就不能不遭到英国人民日益增长的反抗。
