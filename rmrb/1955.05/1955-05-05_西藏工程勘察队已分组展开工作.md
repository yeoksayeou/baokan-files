　　The Tibet Engineering Survey Team Begins Work in Groups

　　The Tibet Engineering Survey Team has begun work in groups. The hydropower survey team began measuring flow velocity and water levels on the Lhasa River on April 28th, and surveying the site for the hydropower plant. The Lhasa Water Conservancy Team inspected the Lhasa city embankment and the flood control situation of the Shahe River in the northern suburbs of the city. The Rikaze work team, composed of fifteen engineers and technicians, also set off at the end of April, heading to Rikaze via Gyantse.

    After arriving in Lhasa, the Tibet Engineering Survey Team, with the help of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Tibetan local government, collected information on various construction projects and formulated a preliminary work plan. The plan includes surveying rivers such as the Lhasa River, Nyang Chu River, and Yangbajing River, designing permanent flood control projects for the Lhasa River and Nyang Chu River, selecting sites for hydropower plants in Lhasa and Rikaze, and collecting information on irrigation and navigation conditions of various rivers. They plan to survey a total length of more than 500 kilometers on various rivers. The plan also includes surveying and designing the Lhasa Leather Factory, a small iron factory, and a small thermal power plant in Rikaze. At present, the survey team's work is to preliminarily survey the Lhasa River and Nyang Chu River to assist the Tibetan people along the river in flood control during the flood season and improve irrigation of some farmland.

　　西藏工程勘察队已分组展开工作
　　西藏工程勘察队已分组展开工作。水电勘测组从四月二十八日就开始在拉萨河上测量流速和水位，勘察水电厂的厂址。拉萨水利组视察了拉萨市堤岸和市北郊沙河防洪情况。由十五名工程技术人员组成的日喀则工作组，也在四月底出发，经江孜前往日喀则。
    西藏工程勘察队到达拉萨后，在中国共产党西藏工作委员会、中国人民解放军西藏军区和西藏地方政府帮助下，搜集了有关各项建设工程的资料，制定了初步工作计划。计划包括勘测拉萨河、年楚河、羊八井河等河流，设计拉萨河和年楚河的永久性防洪工程，选择拉萨和日喀则水力发电厂的厂址，搜集各河流灌溉、航运等情况的资料。他们计划在各河流上勘测的总长度达五百公里以上。计划中还包括拉萨皮革厂、小型铁工厂和日喀则小型火力发电厂的勘察设计工作。目前勘察队的工作是初步勘测拉萨河和年楚河，以便协助沿河藏族人民在汛期防洪和改进部分农田灌溉。（新华社）
