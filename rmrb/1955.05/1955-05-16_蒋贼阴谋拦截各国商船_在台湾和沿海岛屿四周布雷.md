Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique recently notified various governments that, starting May 6th, they would be laying mines around Taiwan and the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops. They also threatened that merchant ships of various countries entering the Taiwan Strait and the mined waters around the coastal islands might suffer losses or injuries. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique laying mines around Taiwan and the coastal islands absolutely cannot stop the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan and the islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops along the coast, but it affects the safety of international shipping in the Taiwan Strait. It is known that on May 4th, the British cargo ship "Yi Long" was shot at and intercepted by the Chiang bandit troops when passing through waters near Baiquan Island. Before this, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique had repeatedly intercepted and attacked cargo ships of various countries sailing on the high seas in the Taiwan Strait.

　　蒋贼阴谋拦截各国商船
　　在台湾和沿海岛屿四周布雷
　　新华社十四日讯  蒋介石卖国集团最近通知各国政府，自五月六日起在台湾四周和蒋贼军盘踞的沿海岛屿四周布下水雷，并恫吓说，各国商船进入台湾海峡和沿海岛屿布雷海面可能遭到损失或伤害。蒋介石卖国集团在台湾和沿海岛屿四周布下水雷，绝对阻止不了中国人民解放军解放台湾和沿海蒋贼军盘踞的岛屿，但是它却影响了台湾海峡国际航运的安全。人们知道，在五月四日，英国货船“易隆号”就在经过白犬岛附近海面时，遭到了蒋贼军的射击和拦截。在这以前蒋介石卖国集团曾多次拦截、袭击在台湾海峡公海上航行的各国货船。
