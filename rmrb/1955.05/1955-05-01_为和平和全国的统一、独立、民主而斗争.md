Struggle for Peace and National Unity, Independence, and Democracy
　　Pei Taiyang, Member of the Executive Committee of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor

With the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people all over the world, the people of Indochina, after more than eight years of heroic resistance, have finally achieved a historic victory in military and diplomatic terms and won peace.

The Vietnamese working class and all the people are elated and full of confidence in these great victories.

In the past nine months of peace, the Vietnamese working class and all the people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have been working hard to overcome all difficulties, correctly implement the armistice agreement, heal the wounds of war, restore the national economy, build a peaceful life, and gradually improve their spiritual and material living standards.

In the northern region, workers have been fighting alongside the people and have victoriously recovered twelve cities, including the capital Hanoi. Before withdrawing, the French deliberately violated the armistice agreement by plundering and destroying machinery and public property, dismissing workers and withholding wages, creating unemployment and famine, and enticing and coercing residents to move south. However, the workers took the lead and united the people to resist and fight against this, and achieved good results. The revolutionary order and daily life of the cities were immediately restored after the Vietnam People's Army took over.

Now, all the working people in this region, under the democratic republican system, and under the leadership and education of the workers, are striving to launch a production recovery competition in order to better serve the people and raise their awareness as masters of the country. No enterprise remains at its old production level; at the very least, productivity has increased two or three times or more; difficulties in technology, raw materials, machinery, and leadership have also been solved under the collective strength. The Gia Lam locomotive repair shop used to require 550 workers to build one carriage, but now it only requires 155 workers. The Hanoi Waterworks used to hire outside labor and spend 600 workdays to clean the reservoir, but now the workers have arranged their own time to clean it themselves, spending only 235 workdays, and it is cleaner than before.

With the fraternal help of the Chinese working class and people, the Vietnamese workers and people have restored the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway connecting Beijing and Hanoi. Recognizing the purpose and importance of the railway restoration work for restoring the national economy and consolidating the cause of peace, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, trade unions at all levels, and the railway trade union concentrated and mobilized cadres and working people from the old liberated areas and the newly liberated areas, and, together with peasants and youth shock brigades, overcame all difficulties such as lack of raw materials and equipment, lack of experience, and the cold season, determined to complete the task. From the start of construction at the end of October 1954 to February 8, 1955, 165 kilometers of railway line and all bridges and culverts were repaired, saving 668,061,000 Vietnamese dong. More than 8,000 model cadres, labor models, and outstanding workers emerged, and 37 Vietnamese labor models, one model unit, and nine Chinese labor models were selected and awarded the third-class Labor Medal by the government. 8,100 new technical workers of various kinds were trained. On February 28, 1955, the first train carrying passengers departed from Hanoi for Friendship Pass, which made the people of the whole country feel extremely excited and full of confidence. Inspired by the new victory, everyone expressed their determination to expand these achievements to continue the 400-kilometer railway work that is currently being actively restored.

Trade unions at all levels and the working people in various provinces continue to enthusiastically participate in launching mass rent reduction and land reform movements. So far, land reform has been completed in 2,087 villages with 7,176,230 people. In early 1955, in only five provinces, 90,000 pieces of agricultural equipment were supplied, making the peasants even more joyfully strive to produce food, cultivate wasteland, and implement the spring competition movement.

Workers are also working hard in various industrial and small industrial sectors to launch competitions to restore and develop production. The output of the mining sector in the northern region has tripled under new demands. Small industries are being restored. In Hanoi, more than 500 households have already started operating; in Haiphong, fourteen pottery kilns with 1,000 workers immediately continued production after the People's Army took over. Normal labor-capital relations are being established in order to develop production.

While restoring the economy, the People's Government pays great attention to the lives of the working people. The unemployment problem left over from the past colonial system is being actively addressed, and more than 30,000 people have already found jobs.

The peace-loving Vietnamese workers and people are eager for national reunification. Every Vietnamese person is full of confidence and enthusiasm and throws themselves into competitions to strengthen the struggle to realize their legitimate aspirations.

However, American imperialism and its lackeys are plotting to undermine peace, unity, and the armistice agreement, trampling on the wishes of the Vietnamese people. They are attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Indochina and make the world situation even more tense. American imperialism is instigating and condoning its lackeys to entice and coerce workers and Catholics to move south; forcibly plunder machinery and public property in the regrouping areas of North Vietnam; they are taking terrorist actions such as revenge and stifling democratic freedoms, and plotting to permanently divide Vietnam.

The southern region is now like a "hell." The chaotic situation in the southern region under the rule of American lackeys makes the lives of workers and people difficult and leads to death. This situation has increased the indignation of the southern workers and people.

However, the Vietnamese working class and all the people firmly believe that, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the conspiracies and actions of American imperialism and its servants will be completely defeated. A movement against American imperialism is spreading widely and deeply among the masses. A wave of opposition to the above-mentioned war-mongering conspiracies and actions has been launched throughout the country. Prior to the handover, more than 200 struggles against violations of the agreement took place in Hong Gai and achieved victory. In many places, despite all their means of enticing and coercing migration, they have been met with opposition; some of those who were previously enticed and coerced to go to the southern region have also returned to their hometowns through struggle; the movement against terror, revenge, demanding democratic freedom, and demanding the restoration of normal relations between the northern and southern regions is surging in the southern region and has received the support of the people of the whole country.

The Vietnamese working class and people have enthusiastically responded to the signature campaign against atomic weapons; enthusiastically support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; warmly welcome the achievements of the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference; and support the World Peace Conference to be held in Helsinki.

The Vietnamese working class and people trust the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries; trust the support and powerful strength of the working class and people all over the world; and trust their own strength. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they will surely be able to victoriously consolidate peace, realize unification, complete national independence and democracy, and contribute to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

　　为和平和全国的统一、独立、民主而斗争
　　越南总工会执行委员会委员　裴泰阳
    在全世界爱好和平人民热烈支持下，经过八年多英勇的抗战的印度支那人民终于取得了军事上和外交上的历史性胜利，赢得了和平。
    越南工人阶级和全体人民对这些伟大的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞和充满信心。
    在刚过去九个月的和平日子里，越南工人阶级和全体人民在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，正在努力克服一切困难，正确执行停战协定，医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济和建设和平生活，逐渐提高精神和物质生活水平。
    在北部地区，工人同人民一道进行斗争，胜利地光复了包括首都河内在内的十二个城市。法方在撤退之前蓄意违反停战协定，如劫运、破坏机器和公共财产，解雇工人和克扣工资，制造失业、饥馑以及诱骗、强迫居民南迁。但是工人们带头并团结人民对此进行了反抗和斗争，并且取得了良好的结果。城市的革命秩序和日常生活在越南人民军接管以后马上恢复起来。
    现在这个地区的全体劳动人民，在民主共和政体下，在工人的领导和教育下，正在努力展开恢复生产的竞赛，以便更好地为人民服务，提高国家主人翁的意识。再没有一个企业停留在旧的生产水平上了，至少都把生产率提高了二、三倍以上；技术、原料物资、机器以及领导等等困难也在集体的力量下得到解决。嘉林机车修理厂以前造一节车厢需用五百五十个工，现在只需要一百五十五个工。河内自来水厂以前洗蓄水池要添雇外边的人工并花费六百个工，现在工人们自己安排好了时间来自己洗，只费了二百三十五个工，并且还比以前洗得干净。
    在中国工人阶级和人民的兄弟般的帮助下，越南工人和人民已经恢复了连接北京和河内的河内—睦南关铁路。认识到修复铁路的工作对于恢复国民经济和巩固和平事业的目的和重要意义，越南总工会、各级地方工会和铁路工会集中了和动员了老解放区和新解放区的干部和劳动人民，同农民和青年突击队一道克服缺乏原料器材、缺乏经验、寒冷季节等一切困难，决心完成任务。从一九五四年十月底开工到一九五五年二月八日，一百六十五公里的铁路线和全部桥梁涵洞修复完毕；节省越币六亿六千八百零六万一千元，涌现了八千多模范干部、劳动模范和部分出色的工作者，选出了荣获政府奖给的三级劳动勋章的三十七个越南劳动模范、一个模范单位和九个中国劳动模范，培养了各种新的技术工人八千一百人。一九五五年二月二十八日首次列车载着旅客从河内开往睦南关，这使全国人民感到无比的兴奋和充满信心。在新胜利的鼓舞下，每个人都表示决心扩大这些成果。以继续目前正积极从事修复的四百公里铁路的工作。
    各省的各级工会和劳动人民继续热烈地参加发动群众减租运动和土地改革。到目前为止，已经在拥有七百十七万六千二百三十人的二千零八十七个乡中完成了土地改革。一九五五年初仅在五个省中，就供应了九万件农具，使农民更加欢欣地努力生产粮食、开荒和实现春季竞赛运动。
    工人还在各工业和小工业部门中努力展开竞赛，恢复和发展生产。北部地区的矿业部门在新的要求下生产量增加了三倍。各小工业正在恢复，在河内，就有五百多户已经开始经营了；在海宁，拥有一千工人的十四个碗窑，在人民军接管以后就立刻继续生产。劳资双方的正常关系正在建立，以便发展生产。
    在恢复经济的同时，人民政府很注意劳动人民的生活。由过去殖民制度遗留下来的失业问题正在积极地加以解决，已经有三万多人得到了工作。
    爱好和平的越南工人和人民，渴望全国统一。每个越南人民都具有信心和充满欢欣的情绪投入竞赛，加强斗争，以实现自己正当的愿望。
    然而美帝国主义和它的走狗们正阴谋破坏和平、统一和停战协定，蹂躏越南人民的愿望。它们企图在印度支那重新燃起战火，使世界局势更加紧张。美帝国主义正在主使和纵容它的走狗们诱骗、强迫工人和信仰天主教的人民南迁；武力劫运他们在北越集结地区的机器和公共财产；他们采取报复和窒息民主自由权利等恐怖行动，阴谋长期分裂越南。
    现在南部地区犹如一个“地狱”，在美国走狗统治下的南部地区的混乱情况，使工人和人民生活困苦、遭受死亡。这种情形增加了南部工人和人民的愤慨。
    但是，越南工人阶级和全体人民坚决相信：在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，美帝国主义和它的仆从们的阴谋和行动一定会遭到完全的失败。一个反对美帝国主义的运动正在群众中广泛而深入地展开起来。全国已经掀起了反对上述制造战争的阴谋和行动的浪潮。在移交以前，在鸿基曾发生了二百多起反抗违反协定的斗争并且取得了胜利。在许多地方，尽管他们用尽一切手段诱骗、强迫迁移，但是遭到了反对；有的以前被诱骗强迫到南部地区去的人们，也经过斗争而返回故乡；反对恐怖、报复、要求民主自由、要求恢复北部地区和南部地区正常关系的运动，正在南部地区汹涌地进行并得到了全国人民的支持。
    越南工人阶级和人民已热烈响应反对原子武器的签名运动；热烈赞成和平共处的五项原则，热烈欢迎亚洲国家会议和亚非会议的成就，并且拥护将要在赫尔辛基召开的世界和平大会。
    越南工人阶级和人民信赖苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家；信赖全世界工人阶级和人民的支援和强大的力量；信赖自己的力量。在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，一定能够胜利地使和平得到巩固、统一得到实现、全国的独立和民主得以完成，并对保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业作出贡献。
