　  Korea Restores and Rebuilds Blast Furnaces
    The No. 1 blast furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron Works in Korea has been repaired and rebuilt and was officially put into production on the 15th at a completion ceremony.
    Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out in a congratulatory telegram to all the workers of this factory that this is a major victory in the process of restoring and developing heavy industry in Korea. From now on, post-armistice Korea will once again be able to produce pig iron. Previously, Korean steel mills could only use scrap steel and scrap iron to make steel.
    During the repair of the blast furnace, the factory received mechanical equipment from the Soviet Union, refractory materials and cement from China, and technical guidance from Soviet experts.
    According to the Korean national plan, the Kim Chaek Iron Works will be expanded into an iron and steel complex.

　  朝鲜恢复和改建炼铁炉
    朝鲜金策制铁所的第一号高炉已经修复和改建完工，在十五日举行竣工典礼，正式投入生产。
    金日成首相在给这个工厂全体职工的贺电中指出，这是朝鲜恢复和发展重工业行程中的重大胜利。从此，停战后的朝鲜已重新能够炼制生铁了。在这以前，朝鲜各炼钢厂只能用废钢、废铁炼钢。
    在修复高炉期间，这个工厂得到苏联援助的机械设备、中国援助的耐火材料和水泥以及苏联专家的技术指导。
    根据朝鲜的国家计划，金策制铁所将扩建成为钢铁联合企业。
