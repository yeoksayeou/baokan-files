Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th (TASS): The Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement on the parliamentary election results, pointing out that the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party should be held responsible for the Conservative Party's victory in the election. The Labour Party's right wing and "the Conservative Party leaders hold completely identical views on all fundamental issues of domestic and foreign policy."

The statement continued: "An emergency Labour Party meeting should be convened immediately, at which the new and serious situation facing the workers' movement as a result of this election can be deeply analyzed, and necessary steps can be taken to change the leadership and policies."

The statement pointed out: A notable feature of this election is that the leaders of all parties had to pay lip service to peace. This is "an extremely important factor in the new international situation now forming, a factor that the Conservative government and the opposition Labour Party must pay attention to. There is now an urgent need to launch a large-scale mass movement to force Parliament and the government to take a genuine position in the Four Power talks that guarantees the prohibition of hydrogen weapons, arms reduction, and the establishment of a unified and peaceful Germany. Only if the people use their power to force them to accept peace can the danger of war be avoided..."

Finally, the Communist Party expressed its belief that the working class "will not be affected by the defeatism of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders, but will learn from the serious political failure suffered by the workers' movement and turn this temporary setback into a glorious victory."

　　英国共产党就议会选举结果发表声明
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：英国共产党发表关于议会选举结果的声明指出：工党右翼领袖应该对保守党在选举中的胜利负责。工党右翼和“保守党领袖们在所有内政和外交基本问题上抱着完全相同的看法”。
    声明接着说：“应当立即召集一次工党紧急会议，在这个会议上可以深刻地分析这次大选的结果使工人运动面临的新的严重形势，并且采取必要的步骤来改变领导机构和政策。”
    声明指出：这次选举的一个显著的特点是：各党派的领袖们都不得不空谈和平。这是“现在正在形成的新的国际形势的一个极其重要的因素，这是保守党政府和反对党工党不得不注意的一个因素。现在迫切需要开展一个大规模的群众运动来迫使议会和政府在四大国会谈中采取保证禁止氢武器、裁减军备和建立一个统一的、和平的德国的真正立场。只有人民用他们的力量来强迫他们接受和平，战争的危险才能够避免……”
      最后，共产党表示相信：工人阶级“不会受工党右翼领袖们的失败主义的影响，而会从工人运动遭受的严重政治失败中汲取教训，并且把这次暂时的挫折转变成辉煌的胜利”。
