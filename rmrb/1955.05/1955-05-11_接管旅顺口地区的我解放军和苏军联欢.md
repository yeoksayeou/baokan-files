Xinhua News Agency Report: The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops taking over the Lushunkou area and the Soviet troops about to withdraw held various joint celebration activities.

When our soldiers entered their posts, the Soviet soldiers warmly welcomed them outside the barracks, and everyone shook hands and embraced affectionately.

Chinese and Soviet troops held joint parties one after another. Amateur theater troupes from both countries performed cultural programs at the parties. The amateur theater troupe of Soviet military officers' families also performed song and dance programs to welcome the Chinese troops. All the Soviet troops' wall newspapers had special welcome issues. The blackboard newspapers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops also had special issues entitled "Learn from the Soviet Army."

Soldiers from both countries had extensive friendly contact in the barracks and on the training grounds. Some had friendly basketball, tug-of-war, and horizontal bar competitions together. Some Chinese and Soviet soldiers played the song "Moscow-Beijing" together. Although they did not speak the same language, they quickly became close friends.

As the Soviet troops were about to withdraw home, the Chinese and Soviet soldiers cherished the time before their departure. The troops held forums and parties separately, and the soldiers visited and talked to each other, exchanged gifts, and took group photos. Many Chinese and Soviet soldiers exchanged meaningful commemorative gifts. More than one hundred of our soldiers gave their commemorative badges to the Soviet soldiers. Some soldiers gave the comfort items that the people of the whole country had given for a long time as gifts to the Soviet army. The soldiers of a certain unit of the Soviet army also gave a well-made model of Tiananmen Square to the Chinese troops.

When the Soviet troops withdrew home, our soldiers sent the Soviet troops out of the camp gate. The troops also sent representatives to the station to bid farewell to the Soviet troops.
