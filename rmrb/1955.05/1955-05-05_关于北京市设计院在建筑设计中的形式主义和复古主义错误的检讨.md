　　A Self-Criticism Regarding Formalism and Revivalism Errors in Architectural Design at the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design
　　Shen Bo, Deputy Director of the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design

    The Beijing Institute of Architectural Design was established in 1952. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and thanks to the efforts of all design personnel, we have learned from advanced Soviet experience and have made certain achievements in our work. The quality of design has gradually improved, and the cost of general construction has also gradually decreased. However, there are serious errors and shortcomings in our work. The most significant error is a serious violation of the principle of "practicality, economy, and, where possible, attention to aesthetics," which the Party and the state have clearly stipulated in the field of construction. Consequently, we have also committed errors of lacking organization and discipline. These errors are inseparable from my leadership of the Municipal Design Institute and my erroneous thinking.

    Our errors and shortcomings are mainly manifested in the fact that some of our architectural designs, particularly the designs of certain large-scale buildings, have increasingly deviated from the principles stipulated by the Party and the state, and have single-mindedly pursued the "splendor" of building imagery, falling into the mire of formalism and revivalism. The concentrated expression of this tendency is looking only at the past and not at the present, blindly copying architectural forms such as ancient palaces and temples. It can be said that from the roof, walls, foundation, interior decoration, paint, to doors, windows, and lamps, almost everything is an imitation of the past. As a result, several large-scale buildings we designed not only feature palace-style large roofs with glazed or barrel tiles, but also feature painted decorations, relief niches, and even fictitious brackets and a large amount of gold leaf in the interior and exterior decorations. The first result of this is a significant increase in construction costs, wasting a large amount of state funds. According to statistics from just twelve projects we designed, the construction of palace-style large roofs alone wasted more than 2.73 million yuan. Among them, the main building of the Western Suburbs Guest House used 300,000 colored glazed tiles for its large roof, worth more than 200,000 yuan. Even the kitchen and laundry room of the Western Suburbs Student Sanatorium were given large glazed tile roofs, resulting in a construction cost of over 300 yuan per square meter for these two buildings. The "Four Ministries and One Committee" office building, which imitated the roof of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City, even used reinforced concrete to create more than 400 large brackets, each weighing more than 300 jin, resulting in more than 60 tons of brackets hanging under the eaves of a seven-story building, wasting money and serving no purpose.

    In order to achieve "beauty" in construction and richness in interior and exterior decoration, we not only squandered a large amount of national construction funds, but even sacrificed the convenience of the interior use of the buildings. The administrative and recreational buildings of the Western Suburbs Student Sanatorium rigidly adopted the room division methods of old Chinese buildings, dividing rooms into central rooms, secondary rooms, and end rooms, with each room becoming smaller than the last, resulting in rooms that should have been large being small, and rooms that should have been small being large, making them very unsuitable. The lighting design of the operating room in this sanatorium is also a clear example. According to the requirements of an operating room, it should only be lit from the north, but here, because the designers were solely concerned with the symmetrical beauty of the building's facade, windows were opened on both the northeast sides, and placed off to one side, making surgery very inconvenient. The outwardly magnificent laundry room and kitchen were the most expensive rooms in the entire sanatorium project, but the usable area of the laundry room was too small, and the drying room could only dry a dozen or so items of clothing each time, far from meeting the needs, and the layout of the room was not suitable for machine installation. In the north and south auxiliary buildings of the Western Suburbs Guest House, there are more than forty rooms, which were already too small, but our designers designed four doors in the rooms (leading to the corridor, balcony, sanitation room and closet) without thinking, and the location was very inappropriate, resulting in the inability to find a suitable place to put a bed in the room. Similarly, due to the pursuit of uniqueness and diversity in architectural form, many false and cumbersome decorations were adopted, and many decorations and accessories could only be produced by hand, resulting in construction difficulties and inevitable waste. The types of doors and windows we designed were not gradually standardized based on increasingly rich experience and the principles of practicality, economy, and aesthetics, but became more and more numerous each year. Even in one building, more than sixty different styles of doors and windows were used. This made it difficult to mass-produce doors and windows using machinery and equipment, and they had to be individually crafted using manual methods. In addition, in many buildings we designed, we also used ax-cut bricks to pave the walls. These ax-cut bricks had to be polished on five sides by hand, and each person could generally only polish five or sixty pieces per day, which was not only labor-intensive and time-consuming, but also seriously affected the health of workers due to the dust generated during the polishing process.

    What is particularly serious is that some of our designers with bourgeois ideology, in order to express themselves, show off their abilities, and pursue personal fame, and establish "artificial monuments" for themselves, did not hesitate to squander the people's blood and sweat and the state's money, competing with each other for luxury and extravagance, and constantly raising construction standards. In terms of architectural form, if you imitate the Ming and Qing dynasties, I will imitate the Song and Yuan dynasties, and even trace back to the Tang and Han dynasties, always the more ancient the better. In terms of building materials, the trend of extravagance is even more rampant. For example, general wall surfaces have developed from cement plastering and pebble dashing to ax-cut stone and granite. Paving floors have also developed from terrazzo and artistic terrazzo to marble and white marble. In terms of decoration, even elaborate carvings are used to make seven-layered marble niches, and expensive rosewood is used to make carved staircase handrails. Even disregarding the state's policy of conserving copper, copper hardware is abused, and copper materials are used to make palace lanterns, wall lamps and other decorative items.

    This kind of tedious piling up, false decoration, and vulgar imitation of antiquity not only completely deviates from the principles of practicality and economy, but the designers' one-sided pursuit of beauty does not actually result in beauty. Some are even extremely ugly in image. The people's criticism of some "palace-style" and "temple-style" new buildings as "modern relics" and "modern grand temples" is enough to show that the "formal beauty" we have tried so hard to pursue has not only failed, but is actually something that the masses of people do not welcome and despise.

    The above-mentioned bad tendencies of formalism and revivalism had developed to an extremely serious point by 1954. This practice of only caring about form and not about content, and blindly copying ancient architectural forms, is essentially a concrete manifestation of bourgeois ideology in architecture. It violates both the architectural principles of the Party and the state and the state's construction policy of concentrating financial and material resources as much as possible to first carry out industrial construction. Therefore, the errors we have committed not only wasted a large amount of state money economically, but also promoted and encouraged the spread and development of erroneous bourgeois design thinking, and also caused extremely adverse effects politically.

    As a Communist Party member and as the actual leader of the Municipal Design Institute, I bear the primary responsibility for the occurrence and development of the above-mentioned errors. I still remember that when the Beijing Public Security Bureau built its office building in 1950, Mr. Liang Sicheng, the deputy director of the Beijing Urban Planning Commission, insisted on adding a large roof, which wasted a lot of construction funds, resulting in the Public Security Bureau having to reduce one floor due to limited funding, sacrificing the use area of ​​forty-two rooms in vain. The mayor severely criticized this practice and pointed out that we should pay attention to preventing this from happening again in the future. After the establishment of the Municipal Design Institute, the Municipal Party Committee also used this as an example to repeatedly instruct me not to blindly pursue the forms of ancient buildings, and clearly pointed out that putting "Taoist hats" on high-rise buildings is not only expensive but also unsightly. It asked me to earnestly implement the central government's architectural principles of "practicality, economy, and, where possible, attention to aesthetics" in my work. However, I did not seriously study these propositions of the Party to make them a powerful antitoxin in my thinking. Therefore, when some "authoritative figures" in the architectural field everywhere wrote articles and gave reports, repeatedly advocating the absurd theory of "architecture is art," and under the guise of beautiful slogans such as "promoting national architectural forms," vigorously promoted their erroneous and reactionary formalistic and revivalist architectural ideas, I could not distinguish between the two opposing architectural principles of the Party and the bourgeoisie in my thinking, resulting in this poisonous formalistic and revivalist countercurrent running rampant in the work of the Municipal Design Institute.

    This situation clearly shows that my political awareness is not high, and my organizational concept is not strong. Faced with the countercurrent of bourgeois formalism and revivalism, I abandoned the principles instructed by the Party, was disarmed in my thinking, actually gave up leadership, and did not resolutely carry out a forceful criticism and struggle against it in accordance with the principles and instructions of the Party and the state in the field of construction. Instead, I went with the flow and even fueled the flames. At the same time, I did not support and promote some of the better designs in the past few years, which basically conformed to the architectural principles of the Party. As a result, righteousness was not upheld, evil flourished, and serious losses were caused to the country in our work.

    The Beijing Municipal Design Institute is a national design institution, and our design personnel are staff members of national agencies. Every stroke we make in our design drawings should consider the interests of the country and the people, and should be imbued with a strong sense of national concept and political responsibility. However, we did not do a good job of educating design personnel in this spirit. In design practice, we only listened to how the construction unit (i.e., the owner) asked us to design, and when some construction units had extravagant and wasteful ideas, and pursued luxury and ostentation in their requirements for construction standards, without considering national interests, our design personnel only took responsibility to the owner, and not to the country. Some even fueled the flames, asking the owner to request additional budgets from the state, and squandering state funds together without any qualms. Sometimes, some staff members of the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Commission made erroneous and unreasonable demands on some architectural designs in accordance with their formalistic and revivalist views without organization or discipline. The design personnel did not argue on principle, but instead, in order to cater to their preferences, even deliberately added a large roof to the building in order to smoothly "pass" in front of the so-called "architectural authorities." All of these show that we did not consciously treat the national construction cause with an attitude of being responsible to the Party, the country, and the people.

    Regarding the above-mentioned errors, our institute had some awareness of them during the work inspection and summary in October last year, but our understanding was still not deep enough, and the inspection was also not thorough enough. In November last year, the Municipal Party Committee convened Communist Party members engaged in architectural work and teaching from units such as the former Central Design Institute, Beijing Municipal Design Institute, and the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University, and gave systematic instructions, severely criticizing the anti-people and reactionary formalism and revivalism, namely bourgeois ideology, in the field of construction. Following this, we studied Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers and the relevant documents of the Design and Construction Work Conference of the Ministry of Construction Engineering of our country, and we woke up in our thinking and deeply felt the seriousness of our errors. In order to earnestly correct the errors in our work, draw a clear line with the corrupt bourgeois ideology, and resolutely correct the deviations of formalism and revivalism, we must strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, strengthen Party spirit training, improve our level of ideological awareness, and lead all staff members of the institute to further inspect work, inspect thinking, and conduct serious criticism and self-criticism. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and under the supervision of the broad masses of the people, and through our subjective efforts, we will definitely be able to thoroughly correct our errors and improve our work.

　　关于北京市设计院在建筑设计中的形式主义和复古主义错误的检讨
　　北京市设计院副院长　沈勃
    北京市设计院是一九五二年成立的。两年来，在党和政府的领导下，由于全体设计人员的努力，学习了苏联先进经验，在工作上是有一定成绩的。设计质量逐步提高，一般建筑的造价也逐步降低。但我们工作中存在着严重的错误和缺点。最主要的错误是严重地违犯了党和国家在建筑方面所明确规定的“实用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的方针，因而也犯了无组织无纪律的错误。这些错误，是同我对市设计院的领导，同我的错误思想是分不开的。
    我们的错误和缺点，主要表现在我们所作的某些建筑设计，特别是若干大型建筑物的设计，越来越脱离了党和国家所规定的方针，单纯地追求建筑物形象的“华美”，陷入了形式主义和复古主义的泥坑。这种倾向的集中表现是只看过去、不看现在，一味抄袭古代宫殿和庙宇等建筑形式，可以说从屋顶、墙面、台基、内部装修、油漆粉刷，一直到门窗、灯盏，几乎无处不是仿古。因此，我们所设计的若干大型建筑物，不仅出现了琉璃瓦或筒瓦的宫殿式大屋顶，而且在建筑的内外装饰上，还出现了沥粉彩画、浮雕壁龛，以至虚设斗拱、大量贴金。其结果首先是大大地提高了建筑造价，浪费了国家大量的资金。仅就我们设计的十二项工程统计，光是由于盖了宫殿式大屋顶一项，就浪费了二百七十三万多元。其中仅西郊招待所主楼大屋顶就用了三十万件彩色的琉璃瓦，价值达二十余万元。甚至连西郊学生疗养院的厨房、洗衣房都加上了琉璃瓦大屋顶，因此这两座建筑每平方公尺造价高达三百元以上。摹仿故宫五凤楼屋顶而作的“四部一会”办公楼，甚至用钢筋混凝土作了四百多个大斗拱，每个重三百多斤，这样就有六十多吨重的斗拱悬挂在七层高楼的屋檐下，费了钱而又毫无用处。
    为了建筑方面的“美观”和内外装修的富丽，我们不仅大量地挥霍了国家建设的资金，甚至还不惜牺牲房屋内部使用上的便利。西郊学生疗养院的行政楼、文娱楼生硬地搬用中国旧建筑中房屋分间的方法，即把房间分成明间、次间、梢间、一间比一间小，结果使得该大的房间小了，该小的房间大了，很不适用。这座疗养院手术室采光的设计也是一个明显的例子。按照手术室的要求，应该只由北面采光，但在这里，由于设计人员单纯从建筑立面的对称美观出发，在东北两面都开了窗子，并且偏在一边，结果做起手术来很不方便。外表富丽堂皇的洗衣房和厨房，是这个疗养院全部工程造价最高的房间，但洗衣房的使用面积过小，烘干间每次只能烘十几件衣服，远远赶不上需要，房间的布置也极不适合于机器安装。西郊招待所南北辅楼中有四十多间房间，面积本来已经太小了，而我们的设计人员却不加思索地在房间里设计了四扇门（通向走道，阳台，卫生室和壁橱），而且位置很不恰当，结果弄得室内连床都找不到合适的地方放。同样地，由于追求建筑形式上的独特、多样，标新立异地采用许多虚伪的和繁琐的装饰，而许多装饰物和配件又只能用手工生产，因而造成了施工的困难和必不可免的浪费。我们设计的门窗的种类不是根据日益丰富的经验和实用、经济、美观的原则逐渐标准化，而是一年比一年繁多。甚至在一座楼里采用了六十几种不同样式的门窗。这样一来，就使得门窗难以利用机器设备大量生产，而只好以手工业的方法去个别制作。此外，在我们设计的不少建筑中还采用了斧刃砖铺砌墙面，而这种斧刃砖要用人工把砖的五面磨光，每人每天一般只能磨五、六十块，不仅费工费时，而且磨砖时砖末飞扬，还严重影响工人的健康。
    尤其严重的是我们某些存在着资产阶级思想的设计人员，为了表现个人，显示自己，追逐个人主义的名誉，为自己树立“人工的纪念碑”，竟不惜糟蹋人民的血汗、国家的钱财，互相竞争比豪华，比气派，不断地提高建筑标准。在建筑形式上你摹仿明清，我就摹仿宋元，甚至上溯唐汉，总是越古越好。在建筑用材上，更是奢风日炽，例如一般墙面，从水泥抹面、水刷石发展到剁斧石、花岗石。铺装地面也从水磨石、美术水磨石发展到大理石、汉白玉。在装饰方面，乃至用精工雕刻，制成七层花边的大理石壁龛，用昂贵的紫檀木制作雕花的楼梯扶手，甚至不顾国家节约用铜的政策滥用铜五金，用铜料作宫灯、壁灯等装饰品。
    这类繁琐堆砌、虚伪装饰、庸俗仿古的建筑，不仅完全脱离了实用和经济的原则，而且设计师片面追求美观的结果，实际上也并不美，有的甚至形象十分丑恶。人民群众批评某些“宫殿式”、“庙宇式”的新建筑是“现代古迹”、“现代大庙”，就足以说明我们千方百计所追求的“形式美”不但是落了空，而且实际上是人民大众所不欢迎、所唾弃的东西。
    以上这种形式主义、复古主义的恶劣倾向，到一九五四年已发展到极端严重的地步。这种只顾形式，不顾内容，盲目抄袭古代建筑形式的作法，实质上就是资产阶级思想在建筑方面的具体表现。它既违反了党和国家的建筑原则，又违背了尽可能集中财力物力首先进行工业建设的国家建设方针。因而我们所犯的这种错误，不仅是在经济上浪费了国家大量金钱，而且助长了鼓舞了资产阶级的错误设计思想的蔓延和发展，在政治上也造成了极其不良的影响。
    作为一个共产党员、作为市设计院的实际领导者，我对上述错误的发生和发展是负有主要责任的。我还记得，一九五○年北京市公安局盖办公楼的时候，由于北京市都市计划委员会副主任梁思成先生硬要他们加上一个大屋顶，浪费了很多的建筑费，结果使公安局因限于经费，少盖了一层楼，白白牺牲了四十二间房屋的使用面积。市长曾对这种作法给予严厉的批评，并且提起注意以后不要再这样办。市设计院成立以后，市委并曾以此为例，一再指示我不要盲目追求古建筑的形式，明确指出高楼戴上“道士帽”，不但费钱，而且难看，要我在工作中认真贯彻中央“实用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的建筑原则。可是我没有把党的这些主张加以认真研究，使之成为自己思想中有力的抗毒素。因此，当着建筑界某些“权威人士”到处写文章、作报告，一再提倡“建筑就是艺术”的荒谬理论，并在“发扬民族建筑形式”等漂亮口号掩饰下，大肆鼓吹其错误的、反动的形式主义、复古主义的建筑思想的时候，我就不能把党的和资产阶级的这两种互相对立的建筑原则在思想上加以是非分明的鉴别，致使这股有毒的形式主义、复古主义的逆流在市设计院的工作中泛滥猖狂起来。
    这种情况，就清楚地说明了：我的政治觉悟是不高的，组织观念是不强的。面对资产阶级形式主义、复古主义的逆流，我放弃了党所指示的原则，在思想上被解除了武装，实际上放弃了领导，没有坚决地依据党和国家在建筑事业方面的原则和指示，对它展开有力的批判和斗争，反而随波逐流，甚至推波助澜；同时，对于过去几年中某些比较好的，即基本上符合于党的建筑原则的设计，也没有加以支持和发扬，结果正气不张，邪气上升，在工作中给国家造成了严重的损失。
    北京市设计院是国家的设计机构，我们的设计人员是国家机关的工作人员，我们在设计绘图中，
  一笔一划，都应该考虑到国家和人民的利益，都应该贯注着强烈的国家观念和政治责任感，可是我们没有很好地以这种精神来教育设计人员。在设计实践中，只听凭建设单位（即业主）叫怎样设计就怎样设计，当某些建设单位存在着铺张浪费思想，在建筑标准的要求上，不考虑国家利益而追求豪华排场的时候，我们的设计人员就只是对业主负责，而不对国家负责了，有的甚至推波助澜，要业主向国家要求追加预算，毫不动心地共同挥霍国家的资金，有时北京市都市计划委员会某些工作人员无组织无纪律地按照他们的形式主义、复古主义观点，对某些建筑设计提出错误的、不合理的要求，设计人员也不据理力争，相反，为了迎合他们的爱好，甚至故意给建筑物加上一个大屋顶，以求在所谓“建筑权威”面前顺利“过关”，这些都说明我们没有自觉地以对党对国家对人民负责的态度，来对待国家建设事业。
    对于上述错误，去年十月我院在检查总结工作时已有所察觉，但思想上仍然认识得不深刻，检查也很不彻底。去年十一月间市委召集前中央设计院、北京市设计院、清华大学建筑系等单位从事建筑工作和教学工作的共产党员，又给了系统的指示，对建筑方面的反人民的、反动的形式主义、复古主义即资产阶级思想，作了严厉的批评。接着又学习了赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作者会议上的讲话和我国建筑工程部设计与施工工作会议的有关文件，思想上才醒悟过来，深深感到错误的严重。为了切实改正工作中的错误，同腐朽的资产阶级思想划清界限，坚决纠正形式主义、复古主义的偏向，我们必须加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，加强党性锻炼，提高思想觉悟水平，并领导全院工作人员进一步检查工作、检查思想，展开严肃的批评和自我批评。我们相信，在党和政府的正确领导下，在广大人民群众的监督下，经过我们主观的努力，我们一定能够彻底纠正错误，改进工作。
