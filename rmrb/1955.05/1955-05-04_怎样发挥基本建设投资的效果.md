How to Maximize the Effect of Basic Construction Investment
　　Zhang Jie

    Fully maximizing the effect of basic construction investment is an issue that affects the speed of China's socialist industrialization. The greater and faster the effect of the funds invested in basic construction, the faster the speed of socialist industrialization, the more the people's lives can be improved, and the more consolidated national defense will be. Therefore, every comrade engaged in basic construction, especially in the basic construction of industry and transportation, should strive to maximize the effect of investment.

    To fully maximize the effect of investment, it is necessary to concentrate the use of national basic construction investment, that is, to concentrate the investment on the construction of heavy industry, especially on key projects in heavy industry. Because only in this way can those heavy industrial enterprises that determine the lifeline of the national economy be put into production quickly, creating conditions for the development of China's light industry, transportation, and agriculture. In recent years, the leading departments of various industries have resolutely implemented the principle of concentrating investment on key projects in heavy industry. Taking the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry as an example, the investment in ten key construction units in 1953 accounted for 37.37 percent of the ministry's total annual investment; in 1954, the investment in twelve key construction units accounted for 66.46 percent of the total annual investment. Among them, the proportion of enterprises built with the help of the Soviet Union in the annual investment also increased from 25.61 percent in 1953 to 60.46 percent in 1954. Since 1953, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has begun to formulate and review the basic construction plan of the machine building industry based on national needs and possibilities, overcoming the phenomenon of investment dispersion and unreasonableness arising from the immediate needs of a factory.

    The principle of concentrated use of investment must also be implemented in the long-term and annual investment plans of each basic construction project. Because only in this way can the construction time be shortened, and the constructed enterprises be put into production quickly. In this regard, due to insufficient planning, the lack of good balance in design, construction, and equipment and material supply, the phenomenon of investment dispersion and prolonged construction time between years is still quite common. For example, a machine tool factory invested more than 20 million yuan in the first five-year plan, started investing in 1950, and is expected to be officially completed by 1956. A heavy machinery factory has a total investment of more than 200 million yuan, started construction in 1950, and is expected to be fully completed by 1958, with a construction time of up to nine years. Taking the second metalworking workshop of this factory, which has an area of more than 10,000 square meters and an investment of more than 10 million yuan, it has also been delayed for five years. Similar situations also occurred in the construction units such as a motor factory and a shipyard. This situation of excessively long construction periods and dispersed investment is serious. This shows that some departments have not yet specifically grasped the principle of concentrated use of investment, so that a large amount of state funds unnecessarily remain in the stage of unfinished basic construction projects for a long time, and cannot be put into production in a timely manner.

    Many of our construction projects, especially key construction projects, often take several years to complete. Therefore, arranging the basic construction plan according to the procedures of production requirements, so that the factories and workshops that are completed first can be put into production as early as possible, is also an important guarantee for maximizing the effect of investment as early as possible and fully. Now, many basic construction departments have realized this. But in the past, some units, due to lack of experience, often considered the conditions of possibility and convenience of civil construction, and rarely considered the order of starting production and meeting the needs of production. They did not arrange the basic construction construction plan according to the procedures of production requirements, but based on the conditions such as which workshop was designed first, or materials were prepared, or easy to construct. As a result, some of the completed projects could not be put into production in time. For example, the slipway project of a shipyard was basically completed in 1953, but it has not been put into production until now. In the machine building industry, in recent years, in the study of factory construction procedures, it has generally been felt that it is necessary to build auxiliary workshops before building basic production workshops, and this has also been done. However, due to the subjective desire of some people to produce products early, they first built processing and assembly workshops and then built preparation workshops and laboratories. This is very unreasonable. For example, the foundry workshop of a machine tool factory was built late, so that the first processing and assembly workshop that had been built could not be guaranteed the supply of castings, which affected the normal entry into production. Therefore, the foundry must strive to complete as soon as possible, and the construction of the assembly workshop can be postponed slightly.

    In addition, does the completion of the basic construction work of industrial enterprises mean that the effect of basic construction investment has been maximized? No. There must also be people who can master the machines, management personnel who can direct production, and sound organizational structures, sufficient product drawings, sufficient raw materials, cooperative products, and tools for production. This shows that only by doing a good job in the preparation work before production can the basic construction project proceed quickly and smoothly according to the national plan. Otherwise, no matter how good the equipment is, no matter how big the factory building is, the national investment effect cannot be brought into play. In this regard, the lessons of Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory and Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory are worth remembering. These two factories, due to lack of experience, prepared technical workers, cadres and work fixtures too late. After the equipment was installed, they could not equip production personnel and management personnel according to the design requirements, and could not supply work fixtures and raw materials according to the design requirements. Therefore, some of the completed workshops could not be transferred to formal production for a long time, and even some new and sophisticated equipment was damaged due to the low technical level of workers, causing loss of state property. Therefore, in order to maximize the national investment effect, and in order to make the completed construction projects quickly produce the products needed by the country, it is also very important to do a good job in the planned production preparation work of newly built factories.

　　怎样发挥基本建设投资的效果
　　张杰
    充分发挥基本建设投资效果，是一个关系着我国社会主义工业化速度的问题。投在基本建设上的资金发挥的效果越大、越快，则社会主义工业化的速度也就越快，人民生活便愈能提高，国防也就愈加巩固。因此，每一个从事基本建设，特别是从事  工业、交通运输业的基本建设工作的同志，都应为充分发挥投资效果而努力。
    要充分发挥投资效果，必须集中使用国家基本建设投资，即把投资集中使用在重工业的建设上，尤其是重工业中的重点工程项目上。因为只有这样，才能使那些决定着国民经济命脉的重工业企业迅速投入生产，为发展我国轻工业、交通运输业和农业创造条件。近几年来，各工业领导部门是坚决贯彻集中使用投资于重工业中的重点工程的原则的。以第一机械工业部为例，一九五三年十个重点建设单位的投资占这个部全年投资额的百分之三十七点三七；一九五四年，十二个重点建设单位的投资，占全年投资额的百分之六十六点四六。其中由苏联帮助建设的企业占年度投资的比重也由一九五三年的百分之二十五点六一增长为一九五四年的六十点四六。从一九五三年起，第一机械工业部开始根据全国需要和可能来编制和审核机械工业的基本建设计划，克服了从一个厂的眼前的需要而产生的投资分散和不合理的现象。
    集中使用投资的原则，还要贯彻到每一个基本建设项目的长远和年度投资计划里去。因为只有这样，才能缩短建设时间，使所建设的企业迅速投入生产。在这一方面，由于计划不周、设计、施工和设备、材料供应没有进行很好的平衡，以致在年度间的投资分散、拉长了建设时间的现象还相当普遍。例如有一个机床厂在第一个五年计划中共投资二千多万元，一九五○年开始投资，预计到一九五六年才能正式完工。有一个重型机器厂总投资为二亿多元，从一九五○年开始建设，预计到一九五八年才能完全建成，建设时间长达九年之久，就以这个厂的面积为一万多平方公尺，投资共一千多万元的第二金工车间来讲，也拖了五年之久。类似这种情况也同样发生在某电机厂和某造船厂等建设单位。这种建设期过长，投资分散使用的情况是严重的。这说明有的部门还没有具体掌握集中使用投资的原则，使大量的国家资金不必要地长期停留在基本建设未完工程的阶段，不能及时投入生产。
    我们的许多建设工程特别是重点建设工程，往往要经过几年的时间才能完成。因此，按照生产要求的程序安排基本建设计划，使先建成的厂房、车间提早投入生产，也是尽早地充分地发挥投资效果的重要保证。现在，很多基本建设部门已经认识这一点了。但在过去，有些单位由于缺乏经验，往往考虑可能和土木建筑施工方便等方面的条件较多，而考虑开工生产顺序和合乎生产需要等方面则很少，他们不是按照生产要求的程序来安排基本建设施工计划，而是以那一个车间先设计好了，或已备好材料，或容易施工等条件为开工先后的依据。结果，有的先建成的工程项目，不能及时投入生产。如某造船厂滑道工程一九五三年已基本完成，但至今尚未投入生产。在机械工业方面，近年来在研究建厂程序上，一般都已感到先建辅助车间再建基本生产车间的必要性，并且也这样做了。但由于有些人在主观上要求早出产品，先建加工装备车间而后建准备车间和化验室、实验室。这是很不合理的。例如有一个机床厂的铸工车间搞得晚了，使已建成的第一加工装配车间得不到铸件供应的保证，影响了正常投入生产。因此，铸工场必须争取尽早完工，而装配车间的建设可以稍为推迟。
    另外，是不是说工业企业基本建设工作一结束就等于发挥基本建设投资效果了呢？不是的。还要有能够掌握机器的人，有能够指挥生产的管理人员和健全的组织机构，有充分的产品图纸，有充分的原材料，协作品和生产用的工具。这说明，只有做好生产前的准备工作，才能使基本建设工程迅速地顺利地按照国家计划进行生产。不然，不论有多么好的设备，多么大的厂房，国家的投资效果还不能发挥出来。在这一方面，哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂的教训是值得我们牢记的。这两个厂由于缺乏经验，生产的技术工人、干部和工卡具等准备得太晚，设备安装好后，不能按照设计要求配备生产人员、管理人员，不能按设计要求供应工卡具、原材料，所以有的已建成的车间迟迟不能转入正式生产，甚至有的新的精密的设备因工人技术水平低而被损坏，造成国家财产的损失。因此，为了发挥国家的投资效果，为了使建设完成的工程迅速地生产国家所需要的产品，做好新建工厂有计划的生产准备工作，也是十分重要的。
