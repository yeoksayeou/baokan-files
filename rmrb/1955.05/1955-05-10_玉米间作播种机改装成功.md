　  Successful Modification of Corn Intercropping Seeder
    Agricultural technicians and mechanics at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Station have successfully modified a Soviet-style 24-row grain seeder into an intercropping seeder for corn, beans, and other crops. Preliminary trial results prove that the modified seeder not only eliminates the problems of seed jamming and crushing but also can sow a variety of crops, solving the problem of intercropping beans with tall-stalk crops. In the past, old-fashioned farm tools were used to sow intercrops, and at most only about 20 mu could be sown in a day, and the quality was also poor. With one modified seeder, more than 200 mu can be sown in a day. The efficiency is more than ten times higher than that of sowing with old farm tools, and the quality of sowing is also good, and it can resist drought and retain moisture. Now, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Station is using the modified Soviet-style 24-row grain seeder to intercrop corn, beans, and other crops for the Dongjiao State Farm, the May 1st, Xihongmen, and other agricultural production cooperatives.
    After the Soviet-style 24-row grain seeder is modified, the original machine is not damaged in the slightest. The main parts of the modification are: (1) Replacing the iron seed-metering wheel with a rubber seed-metering wheel, so that the sowing is both even and does not crush the seeds. (2) Dividing the seed box into six parts with four partitions to suit the intercropping of two rows of corn and one row of soybeans. (3) Adding iron soil-dividing plates to the furrow openers to open up dry soil for sowing. (4) Modifying the covering rings into iron pressing wheels in order to achieve sowing and pressing simultaneously to prevent moisture loss. (5) Adding two iron marking devices to the side of the machine to make the row spacing uniform. (Cai Huanyan)

　  玉米间作播种机改装成功
    北京农业机器站的农业技术人员和机务人员，改装苏式二十四行谷类播种机为玉米、豆子等的间作播种机已经成功。初步试用结果，证明经过改装的播种机不但消灭了卡籽碎粒的毛病，而且还能播种多种作物，解决了高秆作物豆类间作的问题。过去播种间作物是使用旧式农具来播种，一天顶多只能播种二十亩左右，质量也不好，用改装过的一台播种机一天能播种二百多亩，效率比旧农具耠种的提高了十倍以上，播种的质量也好，又能抗旱保墒。现在，北京农业机器站正在用改装过的苏式二十四行谷类播种机给东郊国营农场、五一、西红门等农业生产合作社间播玉米、豆子等作物。
    苏式二十四行谷类播种机经改装后，对原有机器没有丝毫损坏。其改装主要部分是：（一）把铁质排种轮改为橡胶质排种轮，这样播得既均匀，又不会挤碎种子。（二）用四块隔板把种子箱分隔成六分，使适合进行两行玉米一行大豆的间播。（三）在开沟器上加装铁质分土板，用以拨开干土播种。（四）把覆土环改装为铁的镇压轮，以便做到随播随压防止跑墒。（五）在机旁加装两个铁制划印器，使行距均匀。　（蔡焕炎）
