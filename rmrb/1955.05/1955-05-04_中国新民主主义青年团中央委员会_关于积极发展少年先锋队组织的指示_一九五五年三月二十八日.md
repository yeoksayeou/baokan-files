The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
Instruction on Actively Developing the Young Pioneers Organization
March 28, 1955

(I)
	Over the past five years, under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and under the leadership of the Youth League organization, the Young Pioneers organization has established a contingent of 10 million Young Pioneers members. The Young Pioneers organization has played a positive role in coordinating school education, enriching the lives of children, developing their intellectual and physical abilities, and cultivating new moral qualities. It has become a beloved organization for the vast number of children and has been praised by schools, families, and all sectors of society.
	With the development of our country's socialist construction, the people of our country are paying more attention to the growth of the new generation. The vast number of children also yearn to join the Young Pioneers, hoping that the organization will help them make faster progress. This requires the Young Pioneers organization to better play its role in uniting and educating the vast number of children. However, there is a serious shortcoming in the current work of the Young Pioneers, that is, the organizational development is too slow, and it cannot meet the requirements of the broad masses of the people and children.
	At present, there are 76 million children of suitable age for joining the Young Pioneers nationwide, including 38.5 million students of suitable age in junior high schools and primary schools, while there are only 10 million Young Pioneers members, accounting for 13 percent of the children of suitable age nationwide, and 26 percent of the children of suitable age in junior high schools and primary schools. Many schools have not yet established Young Pioneers teams. Except for cities, the number of schools with Young Pioneers teams in each province generally does not exceed 35 percent of the total number of schools. In schools that have already established Young Pioneers teams, generally, they have not paid enough attention to the work of regularly recruiting new members, and the requirements for children are too high and too strict. The average proportion of members in schools with teams is generally only around 50 percent. As a result, many children who should join the Young Pioneers cannot join for a long time, and their enthusiasm and motivation are thus damaged. The main reason for this shortcoming is that the Youth League organizations lack the necessary attention to the work of the Young Pioneers and have not actively led the development of the Young Pioneers. Some Youth League cadres, instructors, and teachers lack a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the Young Pioneers, set the standards for joining too high, and include some requirements that should not be placed on children, and cannot correctly treat and educate children. Therefore, rapidly changing this situation and actively and extensively developing the organization of the Young Pioneers has become the most important issue for the Youth League to carry out the work of the Young Pioneers.
(II)
	The Young Pioneers is a broad educational organization for children. Its task is to organize the vast number of children and, through their own organizations and collective activities, develop their various interests and talents, cultivate their initiative, creativity, and collectivist spirit, and establish the ambition to devote themselves to the realization of communism and the great cause of the motherland. Children love collective life. In this good collective, they can better receive communist education. Therefore, the stronger the Young Pioneers organization and the more children it unites, the greater its role will be. It must be pointed out that it is wrong to regard the Young Pioneers as an organization for a few "advanced" children. Because children are in the period of growth and development, every child needs education and can be well educated. Whether the Young Pioneers can play a positive role mainly depends on whether its activities are rich, interesting, and educational, rather than on raising the requirements for joining. It is also wrong to put the development of the Young Pioneers in opposition to education, thinking that "consolidation must be done well before development can be done." Because the work of developing the Young Pioneers is a huge force to promote the progress of children, and the process of development is the process of education. It is also wrong to treat children of the new era with outdated educational concepts, thinking that only children who are "gentle, well-behaved, honest, and obedient" can join, while those who are "lively, active, and talkative" are "bad" children and cannot join. Because bravery and liveliness are valuable characteristics of children. What we want to cultivate are energetic, proactive, unafraid of difficulties, and creative socialist builders. If children are turned into dull and timid individuals, it will not only harm their normal physical and mental development, but also run counter to our requirements for cultivating socialist new people. Youth League committees at all levels must criticize those outdated educational concepts and the misunderstanding of the nature of the Young Pioneers, vigorously and correctly publicize the nature and tasks of the Young Pioneers and the communist educational thought, so as to remove ideological obstacles for the healthy and extensive development of the Young Pioneers organization.
(III)
	In the future, the Young Pioneers must adopt a policy of active and extensive development. We require that within the next year, junior high schools and primary schools in urban and industrial and mining areas should generally establish Young Pioneers teams; complete primary schools and central primary schools in rural areas should all establish Young Pioneers teams; in areas where complete primary schools and central primary schools have already established most or all Young Pioneers teams, Young Pioneers teams should be established in junior primary schools in a planned manner. In schools that have already established Young Pioneers teams, they should actively carry out team activities and further strengthen the team organization, so as to absorb the vast number of children into the organization of the Young Pioneers. Youth League committees at all levels must also adopt a positive attitude towards the work of establishing teams outside schools. In the rural and urban children outside schools, the work of establishing teams should be carried out in a planned way.
	However, it must be pointed out that the development of the Young Pioneers must be carried out with leadership and planning. Youth League committees at all levels should cooperate closely with the local educational administrative departments, formulate specific plans for the development of the Young Pioneers in accordance with the actual situation, and strengthen specific inspection and guidance in practical work. When developing the Young Pioneers organization, it is necessary to widely carry out publicity and education about the Young Pioneers among children, inspire their desire to join the team, and help them understand what the Young Pioneers is and the meaning of the various symbols of the team. After joining the team, education should also be carried out on how to be a Young Pioneer member. When implementing the policy of active development, attention should be paid to preventing the simple pursuit of numbers and adopting simple registration methods to develop the team organization, so as to avoid the team organization losing its positive role in uniting and educating children and encouraging them to make progress.
	Selecting and training instructors is the main key to doing a good job in the development and education of the Young Pioneers organization. Youth League committees at all levels must earnestly and conscientiously do this work well. Excellent teachers or Youth League members with progressive thinking, upright style, and love for children should be selected and appointed as instructors, and new instructors must be given the necessary training before the team is established, so that they have the basic knowledge to lead the work of the Young Pioneers. The regular leadership of the instructors should be strengthened, their work and study should be cared for, they should be helped to solve difficulties, and their political and ideological and professional level should be improved, so that they can better contribute their strength in the cause of cultivating socialist new people.
(IV)
	Leading the Young Pioneers is an important task entrusted to the Youth League by the Party. Youth League committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen the leadership of the work of the Young Pioneers. Any thought of belittling the work of children and emphasizing unfamiliarity with the business of the Young Pioneers and abandoning leadership is wrong. Children are the new force of the motherland, and Youth League cadres should regard caring for and leading the work of the Young Pioneers as their own responsibility. The Youth League organization should educate Youth League members to regard caring for and loving children as their own communist virtues.
	Youth League committees at all levels must include the work of children on the agenda of the Youth League committee, and earnestly check and guide the work of the Young Pioneers. The Youth League provincial and municipal committees should hold a meeting on the work of children once a year, and hold a meeting of instructors or a training course, and the Youth League county committee should hold a meeting of instructors or a training course once a year, so as to summarize the work, exchange experience, and appropriately commend and reward outstanding instructors. Youth League committees at all levels should urge and help the cadres of the work of children to earnestly improve their work methods, so as to go deep into reality, contact the masses, study hard, and understand the business, so as to further advance the work of the Young Pioneers.

### 中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会　关于积极发展少年先锋队组织的指示　一九五五年三月二十八日

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
　　关于积极发展少年先锋队组织的指示
　　一九五五年三月二十八日
　　（一）
    五年来，少年先锋队组织在共产党和人民政府的关怀下，在青年团组织的领导下，已经建立起一支一千万少年先锋队队员的队伍。少年先锋队组织在配合学校教育，丰富少年儿童的生活，发展少年儿童的智力和体力，培养少年儿童新的道德品质等方面，都起了良好的作用，它已经成为广大少年儿童所热爱的组织，并受到学校、家庭和社会各方面的赞许。
    随着我们祖国社会主义建设事业的发展，我国人民对于新一代的成长更加关切。广大少年儿童也渴望着参加少年先锋队，希望队的组织帮助他们更快地进步。这就需要少年先锋队组织更好地发挥团结教育广大少年儿童的作用。但是，当前少年先锋队工作中存在着一个严重的缺点，那就是组织发展过于缓慢，不能满足广大人民和少年儿童的要求。
    现在，全国适合队龄的少年儿童达七千六百万人，其中初中和小学校中适合队龄的学生三千八百五十万人，而少年先锋队员只有一千万人，占全国适合队龄的少年儿童的百分之十三，占初中和小学校中适合队龄的少年儿童的百分之二十六。许多学校还没有建队，除城市外，全国各省建队学校一般没有超过学校总数的百分之三十五。已经建队的学校，一般都没有很好的重视经常发展队员的工作，对少年儿童要求过高过严，队员占建队学校队龄少年儿童的平均比例一般只在百分之五十左右。这样，就使得不少应该入队的少年儿童长期不能入队，他们的积极性和上进心因而受到损害。造成这种缺点的原因，主要是青年团的组织对少年先锋队的工作缺乏应有的重视，没有积极地领导少年先锋队的发展工作；有些团委干部、辅导员和教师对少年先锋队的性质和任务缺乏明确认识，把入队标准定得过高，并且包含有一些对少年不应有的要求，不能正确地对待和教育少年儿童。因此，迅速地改变这一情况，积极地、大量地发展少年先锋队的组织，就成为青年团当前开展少年先锋队工作的一个最重要的问题。
　　（二）
    少年先锋队是一个广泛性的少年儿童的教育组织。它的任务是在于把广大的少年儿童组织起来，通过少年儿童自己的组织和集体活动，发展少年儿童多方面的兴趣和才能，培养少年儿童的主动性、创造性和集体主义精神，树立为实现共产主义和祖国的伟大事业而献身的志向。少年儿童是喜爱集体生活的，在这个良好的集体中，他们可以更好地接受共产主义教育。因此少年先锋队组织愈壮大，团结的少年儿童愈多，它的作用也就愈大。必须指出，把少年先锋队当做少数“先进”少年儿童的组织是错误的。因为少年儿童正处在成长发育时期，每一个少年儿童都需要教育，也都是可以教育得好的。少年先锋队是否能起良好的作用，主要是在于它的活动要丰富有趣，富有教育意义，而不在于提高入队条件。把少年先锋队的发展工作和教育工作对立起来，认为“巩固好了才能发展”的想法也是错误的。因为发展少年先锋队的工作，就是推动少年儿童进步的一个巨大力量，发展过程就是教育过程。以陈旧的教育观点对待新时代的少年儿童，认为“斯文规矩，老实听话”的孩子才能入队；而“活泼好动，爱说爱闹”的是“坏”孩子，不能入队，这种看法也是错误的。因为勇敢活泼是少年儿童可贵的特征。我们所要培养的正是朝气蓬勃、积极主动、不怕困难、有创造精神的社会主义建设者。如果把少年儿童带成呆头呆脑、畏畏缩缩，不仅有损少年儿童身心的正常发展，而且也是和我们培养社会主义新人的要求背道而驰的。各级团委必须批判那些陈旧的教育观点和对少年先锋队性质的错误认识，大力地正确地宣传少年先锋队的性质任务和共产主义的教育思想，为健康地大量地发展少年先锋队的组织扫除思想障碍。
　　（三）
    今后少年先锋队必须采取积极地大量地发展的方针。我们要求：在今后一年内，城镇和工矿区的初中和小学校，一般地都应建队；农村的完全小学、中心小学全部建队；在完全小学、中心小学已经全部和大部建队的地区，则应有计划地在初小建队。在已经建队的学校，应该积极开展队的活动，进一步壮大队的组织，把广大的少年儿童吸收到少年先锋队的组织里来。各级团委对校外的建队工作，也必须采取积极的态度，在农村和城市的校外少年儿童中，应该有计划地进行建队工作。
    但是必须指出：少年先锋队的发展工作一定要有领导、有计划地去进行。各级团委应当和当地教育行政部门密切合作，按照实际情况，制定发展少年先锋队的具体计划，并加强实际工作中的具体检查和指导。在发展少年先锋队组织的时候，必须广泛地向少年儿童进行关于队的宣传教育，启发他们的入队要求，帮助他们了解什么是少年先锋队和队的各种标志的意义。入队后还应该进行怎样做一个少年先锋队员的教育。在执行积极发展的方针时，要注意防止单纯的追求数字，采取简单的登名造册去发展队的组织，以免使队的组织失去了团结教育和鼓励少年儿童上进的积极作用。
    选聘和训练辅导员是做好少年先锋队组织发展和教育工作的主要关键。各级团委必须切实认真做好这一工作。要选聘思想进步、作风正派、热爱儿童的优秀教师或团员担任辅导员，并须于建队前对新辅导员进行必要的训练，使他们具备领导少年先锋队工作的基本知识。要加强对辅导员的经常领导，关心他们的工作和学习，帮助他们解决困难，提高他们的政治思想和业务水平，使他们在培养社会主义新人的事业中更好地贡献自己的力量。
    （四）
    领导少年先锋队是党交给青年团的一项重要任务。各级团委务必切实加强少年先锋队工作的领导。任何轻视少年儿童工作，强调不熟悉少年先锋队业务而放弃领导的思想都是错误的。少年儿童是祖国的新生力量，青年团的干部都应该把关心和领导少年先锋队的工作当作自己的责任。青年团的组织应该教育青年团员以关心和热爱少年儿童作为自己应当具有的共产主义美德。
    各级团委必须把少年儿童工作列为团委的议事日程之一，认真的检查和指导少年先锋队的工作。团省、市委每年应召开一次少年儿童工作会议，召开一次辅导员代表会议或讲习会，团县委每年应召开一次辅导员代表会议或讲习会，借以总结工作，交流经验，并适当表扬奖励优秀辅导员。各级团委应该督促和帮助少年儿童工作干部切实改进工作方法，要做到深入实际，联系群众，努力学习，通晓业务，以便将少年先锋队工作更加推向前进。
