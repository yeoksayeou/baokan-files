　　Mistake of One Character
　　Han Guozhu
　　On April 28, 1955, a meeting was held in the office of the chief of the Capital Construction Division of the Harbin Railway Administration to discuss the completion of water damage prevention projects before the flood season. When discussing a pile-driving protection project on a subgrade slope of a section of the Binzhou Line, Liu, the deputy chief of the Engineering Division, said to the chief of the Capital Construction Division: "This project has exceeded the original investment by nearly six times. You have to prepare the money!" Hearing this, Miao, the section chief of the Works Division, became suspicious. He said, "How could the budget exceed so much?" He quickly opened the design task book submitted to the design department and was shocked: "Oh! We didn't prepare to build a protection project on the 'Binzhou' Line. Our design task book mentioned the 'Binjiang' Line!" This error was discovered, but unfortunately, it was too late because the design department had already designed the entire "Binzhou" Line project according to the Bureau's order, and all levels of leadership had approved it. The engineering department had almost applied for all the materials needed and was now waiting for construction to begin.
　　This discovery poured cold water on the smooth proceedings of the meeting. After a period of silence, a heated debate erupted. The comrades from the design department said: "I designed it according to the project name list determined by the Administration." The comrades from the Works Division said: "But I submitted the 'Binjiang' Line to the design department, not the 'Binzhou' Line!" The comrades from the planning department, based on the amended plan with the signature of the Works Division chief, which stated "Binzhou" Line, proved that it was indeed the "Binzhou" Line and not the "Binjiang" Line.
　　So, what exactly happened?
　　It turned out that in the Works Division's 1955 capital construction plan submitted to the planning department, there was an item for flood prevention engineering on the "Binjiang" Line, with an investment of 17,400 yuan. However, on the project name list sent to the relevant commissioning, design, and construction units, it became the "Binzhou" Line. It is said that this was because "Binjiang" was mistakenly typed as "Binzhou." But this is just "said to be" the case. At the time, no one could say exactly how the mistake occurred. After the project name list was issued, the commissioning unit did not notice the problem. At the end of last year, when the engineering projects were being prioritized, the Works Division also listed the "Binzhou" project as a first-class project, deciding to carry out the design urgently. Before the planning department submitted the 1955 capital construction plan to the Ministry of Railways for approval, it notified each responsible division to consider whether there were any modifications. The comrades in the planning section of the Works Division, wanting to save trouble, copied the original project name list as the revised plan and sent it up. The responsible comrades and chief engineer of the Works Division also signed their names on it and sent the document away. Not only that, but this matter, along with all capital construction projects, was studied several times by Deputy Director Su of the Railway Administration, but the error was never discovered. Even the 1955 interim capital construction plan finally promulgated by order of the Director of the Administration still stated the "Binzhou" Line.
　　Since the overall situation was set, and the "Binzhou" Line was an urgent flood prevention project, it was necessary to complete it before the flood season. Therefore, the design department immediately sent a group of survey and measurement personnel to the site for 37 days of measurement and, together with the local Works Section, made survey records, assigning a dedicated person to start designing from the beginning of March.
　　When the design just started, the design department received the design task book from the Works Division. This task book mentioned the "Binjiang" Line, which was different from the "Binzhou" Line in the project name list promulgated by the planning department by order of the Director. The comrades in the technical section of the design department saw it and thought: "The 'Binzhou' Line plan has been approved by the Capital Construction Division, and design work has already begun. There shouldn't be any problems." So they sent the design task book to the responsible design section. The section chief of this section was more careful and discovered that the locations of the two project names were different. He immediately contacted the planning department, and the comrades in the planning department asked the Works Division, and the reply was still that the "Binzhou" Line was correct. So the section chief in charge of the design section was relieved, and the design work continued as usual. After hard work, the design task was successfully completed on April 9. However, when you look at the total design budget, you would not believe your eyes: the original planned investment was 17,400 yuan, but the current budget is 110,000 yuan, exceeding the original plan by nearly six times. Logically, the designers should have become suspicious, but instead of discovering the problem from such a large difference in the budget amount, they believed that designing this project, originally estimated to cost 170,000 yuan, now only costs 110,000 yuan, which is the most economical.
　　This error thus went through a series of director's studies, project prioritization, project evaluation, blueprint signing, and approvals... Under the protection of big and small bureaucrats and careless people, it safely traveled many distances. Fortunately, it was discovered and stopped at the last moment—before construction started. Otherwise, the impact on the flood prevention project would have caused great losses to the country during the flood season!

　　错了一个字

    一九五五年四月二十八日，在哈尔滨铁路管理局基本建设处处长办公室内开了一个会，讨论在洪水期以前结束水害工程的施工问题。当讨论到滨州线某一段路基坡面打桩防护工程时，工程处柳副处长对基本建设处长说：“这个工程超过原投资额近六倍，你可得把钱准备好啊！”听见这话，工务处的苗科长怀疑起来。他说：“预算怎么会超出这样多呢？”他赶紧翻开向设计部门提出的设计任务书一看，才吃惊道：“呀！我们并没有准备在‘滨州’线修防护工程啊，我们的设计任务书是提的‘滨江’线哪！”这个错误发现了，但是，可惜时间已经迟了，因为设计部门已经根据局长命令，将“滨州”线的全部工程设计出来，各级领导部门也已批准，工程部门差不多已申请了需用的全部材料，现在就等施工了。
    这个发现，给顺利进行的会议泼了一盆冷水。沉默了一阵以后，热烈的争论爆发了。设计部门的同志说：“我是根据管理局确定的工程件名表设计的。”工务部门的同志说：“可是，我给设计部门提的是‘滨江’线，而不是‘滨州’线呀！”计划部门的同志又以有工务处长签字的修正计划是“滨州”线为根据，证明确是“滨州”线而不是“滨江”线。
    这到底是怎么回事呢？
    原来，在工务处提给计划处的一九五五年基本建设计划中，有一项是“滨江”线的防洪工程，投资额为一万七千四百元。但是在发往各有关委托、设计和施工单位的件名表上，却变成了“滨州”线。据说这是在打字时，将“滨江”错打成“滨州”的缘故。但这只不过是“据说”而已，当时究竟怎么错的，谁也说不清了。件名表发出后，委托单位没有发现这个问题。去年年底进行工程排队时，工务处还把“滨州”这项工程列入了一等工程，决定要紧急进行设计。计划处把一九五五年基本建设计划呈报铁道部批准定案之前，曾通知各主管处考虑一下是否还有修改。工务处计划股的同志图省事，把原来的件名表照抄一份当作修正后的计划送了上去，工务处的负责同志和总工程师也照样签上了自己的名字，把文件送走了。还不只此，这件事情和全部基本建设工程一起，在铁路管理局苏副局长那里研究了好几次，但始终没有发现这个错误，甚至最后以管理局长的命令颁布的一九五五年度基本建设暂行计划中仍然写的是“滨州”线。
    既然大局已定，“滨州”线又是防洪的紧急工程，当然得赶在洪水期之前竣工。于是设计部门马上派出一组调查测量人员，到现场进行了三十七天的测量，并且会同当地工务段作了勘测记录，指定了专人从三月初开始设计。
      设计刚开始的时候，设计部门接到了工务部门的设计任务书。在这个任务书上提的是“滨江”线，同计划处以局长命令颁布的工程件名表中的“滨州”线不一样。设计部门技术科的同志看了后，认为：“‘滨州’线的计划基本建设处都批准了，现在已着手设计，想来不会有什么问题。”就把这份计划任务书发给主管设计科去了。这个科的科长倒看得比较认真，发现两个件名的地点不同，当即和计划部门联系，计划处的同志又去问工务处，得到的答复仍是
  “滨州”线没错。于是主管设计科科长放了心，设计工作照常地进行下去。经过辛勤的劳动，到四月九日，这个设计任务胜利地完成了。但是，看一下设计总预算时，会使你不敢相信自己的眼睛：原计划投资额是一万七千四百元，现在的预算却是十一万元，超过原计划近六倍。照理，设计师们应该引起怀疑了，可是，他们非但没有从预算额相差这样悬殊上发现问题，相反，却认为设计这一工程，原来估计要十七万元，现在只用十一万元，是最经济的了。
    这个错误就是这样地经过一系列的局长研究、工程排队，工程评级、蓝图汇签和批准……在大大小小的官僚主义者和疏忽大意的人庇护下，安全地走过了许多路程。幸亏在最后一个关头——动手施工之前，被发现制止了。否则，为此影响了防洪工程，不知在洪水期间将会给国家造成多大的损失！
