　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company Supports Border Regions and Inland Construction
　　More than seventy production and construction units in the border regions and inland areas of the motherland have signed contracts with Anshan Iron and Steel Company; in the first half of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company will support the construction of these areas with tens of thousands of tons of steel.
　　Now, entire trains of steel rails, fishplates, large I-beams, channel steel, round steel, seamless steel pipes, and various steel bars for concrete are transported from Anshan to Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Guangxi, and Baotou, Jining and other places every day. These steels will be used to build magnificent new factories and mines and water conservancy projects such as steel, coal, petroleum, petroleum machinery, textile, power generation, and sugar refining in the rich border regions and inland areas of the motherland. The builders in the border areas will also use these seamless steel pipes to make drilling machines to explore for rich underground mineral resources such as petroleum.
　　Anshan Iron and Steel is also supplying pig iron and steel to agricultural machinery factories in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, shipping companies of the Sichuan River Navigation Department, and mining machinery factories in Guiyang to produce what they need.
　　Anshan Iron and Steel's steel has also supported the construction of new cities in the border regions and inland areas of the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　鞍山钢铁公司支援边疆地区和内地建设
    祖国边疆地区和内地已有七十多个生产建设单位和鞍山钢铁公司签订合同；在今年上半年内，鞍山钢铁公司将以数以万吨计的钢材支援这些地区的建设。
    现在，每天都有整列车的钢轨、鱼尾板、大型工字钢、槽钢、圆钢、无缝钢管、混凝土用的各种钢筋等，从鞍山运到新疆、云南、贵州、甘肃、青海、广西以及包头、集宁等地去。这些钢材将在祖国富饶的边疆和内地建设起雄伟的钢铁、煤矿、石油、石油机械、纺织、发电、制糖等新型厂矿和水利工程。边区的建设者们并将用这些无缝钢管制成的钻探机钻探石油等丰富的地下矿藏。
    鞍钢并以生铁和钢材供应内蒙古自治区的农具厂、川江航运部门的轮船公司、贵阳的矿山机械厂等厂矿生产需用。
    鞍钢的钢材还支援了祖国边疆和内地新的城市的建设。（新华社）
