The Heilongjiang Provincial Industrial Department has formulated a plan to strengthen the connection between local industry and the rural economy. The output value of plans to serve agricultural production this year accounts for more than 13 percent of the total output value of state-owned local industries in the province, an increase of 2 percent over 1954. The production plan for various new agricultural tools has been increased compared to 1954, based on the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the province: seeders increased by more than 11 percent; hoeing machines increased by more than 12 percent; double-wheeled single-furrow plows increased by more than 33 percent; threshers, disc harrows, as well as double-wheeled double-furrow plows, universal cultivating and weeding machines, rocker reapers, waterwheels, and other small farm tools have also increased in production compared to 1954.

In order to meet the requirements for improving agricultural cultivation techniques, the production of chemical fertilizers has also increased compared to 1954: the planned output of granular fertilizer made using peat resources has increased by 6,338 percent; superphosphate has increased by more than 171 percent; steamed bone meal has increased by more than 20 percent. In order to explain the role of chemical fertilizers in increasing grain crop yields to the vast number of farmers, the local state-owned chemical plant has also allocated 120 tons of granular fertilizer from increased production and savings to be used for trial purposes in key villages free of charge.

In order to strengthen the repair of new agricultural tools, the Industrial Department has also dispatched staff to key counties for inspection, and transferred repair technicians from various counties to the machinery factories in Songjiang and Jiamusi for short-term training. As a result, the vast majority of seeders in the province have been repaired, meeting the needs of the spring plowing season; weeding machines have also been repaired.

Currently, counties are establishing agricultural tool repair and distribution networks to facilitate timely repairs of agricultural tools for farmers. The Industrial Department also stipulates that each agricultural tool factory directly under the province should establish relationships with two or three agricultural production cooperatives in order to listen to farmers' opinions at any time. The Industrial Department will especially strengthen the technical management of each agricultural tool factory and promptly check the implementation of the agricultural production service plan by each unit.

　　黑龙江工业厅作出计划
  　加强地方工业同农业的联系
    黑龙江省工业厅作出了关于加强地方工业同农村经济联系的计划。今年为农业生产服务计划的产值，占全省地方国营工业总产值的百分之十三以上，比一九五四年提高百分之二。各种新式农具的生产计划，根据全省农业互助合作运动的发展，比一九五四年都有所提高：播种机提高百分之十一多；铲?机提高百分之十二多；双轮一铧犁提高百分之三十三多；脱谷机、圆盘耙以及双轮双铧犁、万能中耕锄草机、摇臂收割机、水车和其他各种小农具的产量，也都比一九五四年提高了。
    为了适应农业耕作技术提高的要求，在化学肥料生产方面也比一九五四年有了增加：利用草炭资源做的颗粒肥料，产量计划提高百分之六千三百三十八；过磷酸钙提高百分之一百七十一多；蒸骨粉提高百分之二十多。为了向广大农民说明化学肥料对粮食作物增产的作用，还由地方国营化学厂从增产节约中提出一百二十吨颗粒肥料，无代价送给各重点村试用。
    为了加强新式农具的修理工作，工业厅还抽调工作人员分赴重点县检查，并抽调了各县的修理技术工人，在松江和佳木斯两地的机械厂进行了短期训练。结果全省绝大部分播种机得到了修理，满足了春耕期的需要；锄草机也作了修理。
    目前各县正在建立农具修配网，以便利及时为农民修理农具；工业厅并规定省直属的每个农具厂都同两个或三个农业生产合作社建立关系，以便随时听取农民意见。工业厅则特别加强领导各农具厂的技术管理工作，及时检查各单位对农业生产服务计划执行的情况。
