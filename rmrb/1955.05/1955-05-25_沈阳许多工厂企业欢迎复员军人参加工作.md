Many factories and enterprises in Shenyang are actively assisting the Transfer and Construction Committee in properly settling demobilized construction soldiers.

Since the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of party member cadres in early April to mobilize all units to vigorously carry out the work of settling demobilized construction soldiers, many factories and enterprise departments have taken the initiative to propose plans for employing people based on work needs, giving priority to employing demobilized construction soldiers. The HuangguTtun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory employed 58 demobilized construction soldiers at the end of April, and converted 70 demobilized construction soldiers previously employed as temporary workers into formal workers. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also gave priority to employing 70 demobilized construction soldiers. The Shenyang Paper Mill, the Third Machine Tool Plant, the Fourth Rubber Plant, the High-Voltage Switch Factory, and others, respectively held welcome meetings or forums to welcome the demobilized construction soldiers who came to work in their units. At the welcome meeting for demobilized construction soldiers at the Heavy Machinery Plant, the factory director and the party committee secretary both spoke, enthusiastically encouraging the demobilized construction soldiers to continue to maintain and carry forward their glory in labor.

Many factories and enterprises have made appropriate arrangements for the demobilized construction soldiers they employ, both in work and in life. In each workshop of the HuangguTun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, outstanding technical workers were specially selected to sign apprenticeship contracts with demobilized construction soldiers, guaranteeing teaching and learning. The masters all expressed that they must earnestly teach the demobilized construction soldiers the technology and train them to become third-level technical workers on schedule. In order to take care of the health of the demobilized construction soldiers, the Heavy Machinery Plant specially conducted a general physical examination for the demobilized soldiers who came to work in the factory, and then assigned them appropriate work based on their health conditions. Those who were weak or had illnesses that made them unsuitable for work were allowed to rest temporarily and work after their health recovered.

　　沈阳许多工厂企业欢迎复员军人参加工作
    沈阳市许多工厂企业积极协助转业建设委员会妥善地安置复员建设军人。
    自中共沈阳市委员会于四月上旬召开全市党员干部会议，动员各单位大力开展安置复员建设军人的工作后，许多工厂企业部门都主动地根据工作需要提出了用人计划，优先采用复员建设军人。皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂在四月底采用了五十八名复员建设军人，并将过去录用的七十名复员建设军人，由临时工转为正式工人。沈阳重型机器厂也优先采用了七十名复员建设军人。沈阳造纸厂、第三机床厂、橡胶四厂、高压开关厂等，都分别召开了欢迎大会或座谈会欢迎来到本单位工作的复员建设军人。重型机器厂在欢迎复员建设军人大会上，厂长和党委书记都讲了话，热情地勉励复员建设军人在劳动中继续保持光荣、发扬光荣。
    许多工厂企业对于录用的复员建设军人，在工作和生活上都作了适当的照顾。皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂各车间，都特地挑选优秀的技术工人同复员建设军人订立包教保学的师徒合同。师傅们都表示一定要认真地把技术教给复员建设军人，并按期把他们培养成为三级技术工人。重型机器厂为了照顾复员建设军人的健康，特地为到该厂工作的复员军人普遍检查了一次身体，然后根据他们的健康情况，分配适当的工作。身体较弱或有病不适于工作的，让他们暂时休养，待健康恢复后再工作。
