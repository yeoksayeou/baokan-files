Strive to Gradually Realize the Socialist Industrialization of the Country!
    Today, the Chinese people celebrate the international day of unity for working people all over the world – the “May 1st” International Labor Day of 1955 – with excitement and encouragement.
    In the past year, our glorious working class has launched a nationwide labor competition, completed the national construction plans for 1954 and the first quarter of 1955, and made many new achievements in our great socialist construction cause. Many new factories, which never existed in our history, have been or are being built. Thousands of new products that our country could not manufacture in the past are now being self-made. The productivity of the entire society is increasing day by day under the brave labor of the working class.
    1955 is a crucial year for our country's Five-Year Plan. The total output value of industry and agriculture will continue to increase on the basis of 1954. The tasks of basic construction, transportation, and all aspects of the national economy are more arduous than in 1954. The completion of these tasks will further increase our country's socialist economic strength and national defense strength.
    Socialism brings infinite happiness and a bright future to our people. The working people of our country must further promote their enthusiasm and creativity in labor. Strive to gradually realize socialist industrialization! (Attached image)

    To meet the needs of the ever-developing industrial electricity consumption in the Chongqing area, the Shizitan Hydropower Station project officially started construction last August. After the completion of this hydropower station, the cost of industrial electricity consumption in the Chongqing area will be reduced by about three-quarters compared to the present. This is the river-blocking dam body under construction.

    The construction project of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant completed the civil engineering construction tasks of the first phase last year and partially generated electricity. After the newly installed machines are put into production one after another this year, the power generated by the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will increase three times compared to the current power generation. At that time, the power supplied by the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will be equal to 153% of the original power capacity of Taiyuan City. Photo by Zhang Xinghe

    The amount of basic construction work completed by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the first quarter of this year was more than twice that of the same period last year. This is the exterior view of Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine completely uses electric shovels, electric locomotives, and drilling machines and other machinery for coal mining. Some mines have also completely mechanized the coal mining process from underground to above ground.

    The planned crude oil production of Yumen Oilfield this year will increase by more than 30% compared to last year. To meet the needs of increased production, the refinery's combined cracking plant and distillation plant will be expanded, modified, or have spare equipment added this year. Soon, a large-scale electric crude oil desalting plant will also be built. This is the refining furnace and tank farm of Yumen Oilfield. Petroleum Workers' Newspaper manuscript

    In the construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, a large number of industrialized prefabricated construction methods were adopted. This year, the proportion of industrialized prefabricated construction in this plant has been further increased. This advanced construction method can greatly accelerate the construction progress of the last batch of projects of this plant.

    Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant will trial-produce new products such as Soviet-style ф127 gantry planers and Belgian-style gantry planers this year to supply the needs of industrial construction.

    The output of the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory increased significantly in the first quarter. Workers in the third spinning roving workshop of this factory have carefully promoted the new working method of large package winding, which makes the roving even and reduces the end breakage rate in the spinning workshop.

    China's first large-scale mechanized and automated oil pressing plant - Zhengzhou Oils and Fats Chemical Plant has been put into production. The entire project of this factory was designed by our own engineering and technical personnel, and it will produce nearly 10,000 tons of cottonseed oil for the country every year.

    为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗！
    今天，中国人民满怀着兴奋鼓舞的心情来庆祝全世界劳动人民团结的节日——一九五五年的“五一”国际劳动节。
    我国光荣的工人阶级在过去一年中，展开了全国范围的劳动竞赛，完成了一九五四年和一九五五年第一季度的国家建设计划，使我国伟大的社会主义建设事业取得了许多新的成就。我国历史上从来没有的许多新工厂，已经或正在建立起来。过去我国不能制造的千百种新的产品，现在开始自制。整个社会的生产力，正在工人阶级的奋勇劳动下，日益提高。
    一九五五年是我国五年计划具有关键性的一年。工农业总产值将在一九五四年的基础上继续提高。基本建设、交通运输和国民经济各个方面的任务，都比一九五四年更为繁重。这些任务的完成，将进一步增加我国社会主义的经济力量和国防力量。
    社会主义给我国人民带来无限幸福和美好生活的远景。我国劳动人民必须更高度地发扬劳动的积极性和创造性。为逐步实现社会主义工业化而努力奋斗。（附图片）
