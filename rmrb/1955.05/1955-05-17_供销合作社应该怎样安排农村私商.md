Editor's note: The Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office of Songjiang Special District held a pilot meeting on arranging private merchants, systematically reviewing and summarizing the work and experience of local county supply and marketing cooperatives in arranging and transforming private merchants. It also proposed several solutions to the current problems. Some of these specific methods can be followed by other regions across the country, while others may not be applicable everywhere. However, it is very good to promptly review and summarize the problems in this work, summarize and improve the existing experience, and propose specific solutions tailored to the local situation. This is very necessary to promote and improve this work. Currently, there are still many regions in the country that have not carried out the work of arranging and transforming rural private merchants, or have made little progress. The supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas should quickly strengthen their leadership over this work, check for existing problems, summarize existing experience, and take effective measures to fully develop this work.

The pilot work of arranging private merchants in the counties of Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, has been successful. After ideological education was conducted among the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives and the private merchants, the supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas have opened and expanded wholesale business to private merchants, and have made key arrangements for merchants in difficulty. The phenomenon of queuing and crowding when the masses buy goods has begun to decrease, and the entire market has begun to become active. However, most areas still have many shortcomings and problems in the pilot work. The ideological education of the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives is not deep and thorough enough, and it is not complete and comprehensive enough. It negates the past achievements and role of the supply and marketing cooperatives, so the cadres of the grass-roots cooperatives cannot carry out the arrangement work on the basis of a correct understanding of the policy, and even cause some ideological confusion. For example, after studying, the staff of the Zhujing Supply and Marketing Cooperative believed that all the past work was wrong. The arrangement of private merchants did not distinguish between priorities, and did not arrange the difficult households in key industries first, and then carry out a comprehensive arrangement. Instead, the non-difficult and easy-to-arrange households have been arranged, but the difficult households have not been arranged. Some supply and marketing cooperatives also have very chaotic procedures in carrying out wholesale business; the principle of establishing or strengthening wholesale business in the grass-roots cooperatives has not been well implemented. The lack of support from relevant departments for the supply and marketing cooperatives has also created some difficulties for the arrangement of private merchants. On March 10, the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office of Songjiang Special District held a pilot work meeting on arranging private merchants to study ways to improve and promote the work in response to the above shortcomings and problems.

In terms of educating the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives, the meeting summarized the existing experience and believed that three key points should be grasped: (1) Start with summarizing the changes in the market after the implementation of the general line, affirm the role of the supply and marketing cooperatives in the rural primary market, and also affirm the achievements of the supply and marketing cooperatives in procurement and supply in recent years; then explain that there are still abnormal situations in the current work of socialist transformation of rural private commerce, and point out that it is very detrimental to the country, the people, and the supply and marketing cooperatives if the supply and marketing cooperatives do not do a good job in arranging for private merchants. (2) Provide positive explanations of the significance of the current arrangement of market work and conduct policy education, analyze the situation of rural private merchants, and adopt the method of calculating three accounts (can the supply and marketing cooperatives completely replace private merchants? Will the supply and marketing cooperatives collapse if they give up part of the retail sales? What are the benefits of arranging private merchants, and what are the disadvantages of not arranging private merchants?). When conducting policy education, it should be emphasized that small merchants and peddlers are working people; it should also be explained that arranging and transforming small merchants and peddlers is a way to carry out socialist transformation for them; the cooperative will carry out wholesale business in the future, lead the entire primary market, have more work, and have heavier responsibilities. In this way, the staff can be relieved of ideological concerns such as fear of making right-leaning errors in their work, and temporary employees can be relieved of their fear of unemployment, and can prevent negative emotions from occurring in their work. (3) Clearly explain to cadres the steps and general practices of arranging private merchants.

Strengthening the education of rural private merchants and improving their enthusiasm for business is also an important aspect of doing a good job in the arrangement work. Facts have proved that as long as the small merchants and peddlers are told that they are working people, their nervousness will be eased and they will actively approach the cooperatives. At the same time, it must also be pointed out to them that private commerce has a negative and backward side. Not only commercial capitalists, but also small merchants and peddlers have been infected with different degrees of speculative and opportunistic thinking in the past. This is an important reason why they have been opposed by working farmers, causing difficulties in their current business. It should be pointed out to them that the conditions for rural private commerce to strive to take the socialist road are mainly: improving understanding and obeying the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives; improving business and doing a good job in business; establishing new commercial ethics and changing the old merchant style.

Regarding how to arrange the specific problems, the unanimous view at the meeting was: first, a ranking of households in difficulty should be carried out. The supply and marketing cooperatives should, together with the town people's committee, the tax office, the bank, the industrial and commercial departments, etc., divide all private merchants (including vendors) in the town into three types according to industry: those who are currently doing well and have surpluses, those who can currently maintain, and those who can no longer maintain. The experience of Nanqiao, Datuan and other places proves that after the ranking, it is known which households must be arranged as soon as possible. Second, the nature of each industry should be used to further divide them into three types of industries that are currently needed by the state and the masses and will have prospects in the future, those that are currently temporarily needed but will not be needed in the future, and those that are not needed at all. With such a classification, priorities can be distinguished. If they are all households in difficulty, arrange the industries that are needed by the state and the masses and have prospects first, and arrange the industries that are temporarily needed and not needed at all by the state and the masses later. Without doing this, such as the Nanqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative, although it knew which were the households in difficulty, it did not distinguish between urgency and priority, which increased a lot of difficulties for the arrangement work.

The reasons for the difficulties in the operation of households in difficulty can be summarized as follows: First, the source of goods is controlled by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and they cannot get goods; second, the source of goods is insufficient and the industries that are eliminated due to the needs of the masses (such as selling superstitious items); third, the lack of necessary funds; fourth, too many personnel and excessive expenses. After analyzing the reasons for the difficulties in Tinglin, Zhuanqiao and other places, they can take different ways to arrange them in response to various difficulties: For the first and second types of households, expand wholesale business, state-owned and cooperative commerce withdraw certain retail outlets or counters, and allocate several types of goods to private merchants to operate; for the third type of households, the bank should give small loans according to the specific situation or the supply and marketing cooperative can arrange them through consignment sales; for the fourth type of households, in addition to appropriately helping some of their personnel to transfer to other industries according to the actual situation, the supply and marketing cooperative can give them more popular goods when wholesaling. In addition, there is also a type of merchant (mostly commercial capitalists) who have difficulties because the capitalists are operating passively, wanting to drag down the business, unwilling to invest, or even withdrawing capital. In addition to taking appropriate measures in terms of the source of goods for this type of household, employees can also be mobilized to persuade the capitalists to increase capital. Judging from the situation in Nanqiao, Datuan, Tinglin and other places, after taking these measures, all the households in difficulty in pure commerce can basically be arranged and maintained.

For the handling of several specific issues in the arrangement, the following principles should be followed:

The issue of entrusting private merchants to sell on consignment: Materials uniformly sold by the state (oil, grain, cloth, etc.) must be entrusted to private merchants on consignment, provided that the sales target specified by the state is not exceeded. The private merchants selling on consignment must have reliable conditions. For merchants who are not in financial difficulty, the method of distribution should be adopted as much as possible. For certain means of production (such as small farm tools), which were originally operated by private merchants, they can also be entrusted to sell a part on consignment.

The issue of loans to private merchants: Banks have monthly quotas for loans to private merchants. In order to be able to lend reasonably and correctly, the supply and marketing cooperative can first make specific suggestions, and the bank can, in principle, lend according to the suggestions of the supply and marketing cooperative. For the original debtor households, if they are currently in difficulty, they can continue to lend and repay. If they are passively defaulting, they should be mobilized to repay. For tax arrears households, they should also be arranged temporarily. The supply and marketing cooperative should study the reasons for the private merchants' tax arrears with the tax bureau. If they are delaying and resisting households, they should be mobilized to pay them off. If the tax bureau has indeed over-assessed the private merchants' taxes in the past, it should be re-examined and revised in order to handle it realistically.

Regarding the calculation of the standard of living arrangements for private merchants: In general, the principle should be that their business income can basically maintain the local residents' living standards. In the past, some areas deducted the private merchants' turnover too tightly in the arrangement, so that their income still could not maintain their lives. This bias should be corrected immediately.

At this meeting, everyone believed that the development of wholesale business by supply and marketing cooperatives is an important key to the arrangement of private merchants. The supply and marketing cooperative should establish wholesale institutions according to the source of goods, the direction of commodity circulation, and the requirements of reducing turnover links. Generally speaking, the market towns where the county cooperative is located can temporarily be responsible for wholesale by the county cooperative, and gradually transition to the grass-roots cooperative (because the county cooperative's wholesale work cannot fully meet the small merchants' and peddlers' requirements for variety); when the grass-roots cooperative establishes a wholesale institution, it should also be based on the specific situation: if the district supply and marketing cooperative itself has many departments, and there are many private merchants in the larger market towns, a special wholesale department should be established; in places where the market towns are small and there are few private merchants, the wholesale work can be done by the supply and marketing cooperative's retail department, but there should be full-time cadres responsible for the wholesale business to prevent wholesale and retail from being confused and financial chaos. Regarding the purchase plan, small merchants and peddlers may not need to have one, they only need to make a "goods requisition list". In the past, some supply and marketing cooperatives emphasized that small merchants and peddlers should make monthly plans, but in fact they could not be well implemented, and the work was passive. For cooperative groups, distribution stores and other single-line contact merchants with larger scale and capital, you can try to let them make monthly and quarterly purchase plans to cultivate their planning in operation and gradually bring them into the track of the national plan.

The supply and marketing cooperative is an enterprise that independently accounts for profits and losses. If the wholesale pricing problem is not handled properly, the supply and marketing cooperative may lose money. This is very detrimental to the arrangement of private merchants. However, the wholesale pricing problem is a very complicated problem, and it is difficult for the grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives to formulate wholesale prices. In order to solve this problem with more certainty, the wholesale prices of commodities in the grass-roots cooperative should be formulated by the county supply and marketing cooperative according to the local specific conditions, and implemented after being approved by the county financial committee. The principle of wholesale pricing should be to stabilize market prices, both promote the development of the supply and marketing cooperative's wholesale business, and enable private merchants to obtain reasonable profits.

　　供销合作社应该怎样安排农村私商
    编者按：江苏省供销合作总社松江专区办事处召开安排私商试点会议，比较系统地检查和总结了当地各县供销社安排改造私商的工作情况和经验，并且针对当前存在的问题提出了若干解决办法。这些具体办法有的是全国各地可参照仿行的，有的不一定是各地都适用的；但及时检查总结这项工作中的问题，把已有的经验加以总结提高，针对当地具体情况提出解决问题的具体办法，这种做法是很好的，对于推动和改进这个工作是非常必要的。目前，在全国还有不少地区没有进行安排改造农村私商的工作，或者进行了安排改造但进展不大。这些地区的供销合作社应该赶快加强对这个工作的领导，检查存在的问题，总结已有的经验，采取有效的措施，使这个工作全面地开展起来。
    江苏省松江专区各县安排私商的试点工作是有成绩的。对供销合作社工作人员和对私商进行了思想教育以后，这些地区的供销社都开办和扩大了对私商的批发业务，对困难商户已作了重点安排；群众购买商品排队拥挤的现象已经开始减少，整个市场已经开始活跃起来。但是，多数地区在试点工作中也还有不少缺点和问题。对供销社工作人员的思想教育还不够深入和透彻，同时也不够完整和全面，否定了供销社过去的工作成绩和作用，因而就不能使基层社的干部在正确领会政策的基础上进行安排工作，甚至引起了一些思想混乱。如朱泾供销社的工作人员学习以后，认为过去的工作通统作错了。对私商的安排没有分别轻重缓急，不是先把重点行业的困难户安排下来，然后再进行全面安排；而是把不困难的、好安排的户已经安排好，对困难户却没有安排。有的供销社在开展批发业务方面，手续也很紊乱；基层社需要建立或加强批发业务的原则还没有很好地贯彻。有关部门对供销合作社支持不够，也给安排私商工作造成了一定的困难。江苏省供销合作总社松江专区办事处三月十日召开供销社安排私商试点工作会议，针对上述缺点和问题，研究了改进和推动工作的办法。
    在对供销社工作人员进行教育方面，会议总结了已有的经验，认为应该掌握三个重点：（一）从总结贯彻总路线后市场发生的变化入手，肯定供销合作社在农村初级市场中所起的作用，同时也把几年来供销社在收购和供应方面的成绩肯定下来；然后说明当前在对农村私营商业进行社会主义改造的工作中仍然存在着不正常的情况，指出供销社如果不做好对私商的安排工作，对国家对人民对供销社都是十分不利的。（二）正面讲解当前安排市场工作的意义和进行政策教育，分析农村私商的情况，可以采用算三笔账（供销社能不能全部代替私商？供销社让出部分零售额是不是会垮台？安排私商有什么好处，不安排私商有什么坏处？）的办法。在进行政策教育的时候，应该着重指出小商小贩是劳动人民；还应该说明：安排和改造小商小贩是对他们进行社会主义改造的一种方式；合作社今后要开展批发业务，领导整个初级市场，工作更多了，责任更重了。这样，才能解除工作人员怕在工作中犯右倾错误、临时雇用人员怕失业等等思想顾虑，并且可以防止在工作中发生消极情绪。（三）向干部明确交代安排私商的步骤和大体的做法。
    加强对农村私商的教育，提高他们的经营积极性，也是做好安排工作的一个重要方面。事实证明，只要向小商小贩说明他们是劳动人民，小商小贩的紧张情绪就会缓和下来，并且会积极向合作社靠拢。同时，也必须向他们指出私营商业有消极落后的一面，不但是商业资本家，就是小商小贩过去也沾染着不同程度的投机取巧的思想；这正是他们遭到劳动农民反对，使目前经营发生困难的一个重要原因。应该向他们指出农村私营商业争取走社会主义道路的条件主要是：提高认识，服从供销社的领导；改善经营，搞好业务；树立新的商业道德，改变旧的商人作风。
    关于怎样具体安排的问题，在会议上得到的一致的看法是：首先应该进行困难户排队，由供销社会同镇人民委员会、税务所、银行、工商科等部门，把全镇私商（包括摊贩）按行业分为：目前经营较好尚有盈余的、目前还能维持的、目前已不能维持的三种类型户。南桥、大团等地的经验证明，排队以后，就知道那些户是必须尽先安排的了。其次，应当根据各个行业的性质再划分出目前国家和群众需要将来也有前途的、目前暂时还需要但将来不需要的和根本不需要的三种类型的行业。这样一分类，就可以分别轻重缓急了。如果同是困难户，对国家和群众需要的有前途的行业先安排，对国家和群众暂时需要和根本不需要的行业后安排。没有这样做的，如南桥供销社，虽然知道了那些是困难户，但是不分缓急先后，就给安排工作增加了很多困难。
    将困难户经营上发生困难的原因归纳起来，大体有下列几种：一、货源为国营商业和合作社商业所掌握，自己进不到货；二、货源不足和因群众不需要而被淘汰的行业（如卖迷信品的）；三、缺乏必要的资金；四、人员多，开支过大。亭林、颛桥等地分析了困难原因以后，就能针对各种不同的困难，采取不同的方式予以安排：对待第一、二两种类型户，扩大批发业务，国营和合作社商业撤销一定的零售点或柜台，划出若干品种商品让给私商经营；对第三种类型户，银行要根据具体情况给以小额贷款或由供销社通过代销的办法进行安排；对第四种类型户，除了根据实际情况适当帮助它们一部分人员转业以外，供销社在批发时可多给一些畅销货。此外，还有一种商户（大多数是商业资本家），是因为资方经营消极，想要拖垮，不愿投资甚至抽出资本而发生困难的。对于这种类型户除在货源上采取适当措施外，并可发动职工动员说服资方增资。从南桥、大团、亭林等地情况来看，采取了这些措施以后，所有纯商业中的困难户基本上都能安排和维持下来。
    对于安排中的几个具体问题的处理，应掌握以下原则：
    委托私商代销问题：由国家统销的物资（油、粮、布等），必须在不超过国家规定的销售指标的原则下，才可委托私商代销，代销的私商要有可靠的条件；对资金不困难的商户，以多采用经销办法为宜；对于某些生产资料（如小农具），原来私商就经营的，也可委托他们代销一部分。
    对私商贷款问题：银行对私商的贷款每月都有额度下达，为了能够合理地正确地进行贷放，可由供销社先提具体意见，银行原则上就可以根据供销社的意见贷放。对原欠户，如果它们当前确实困难的，仍可续贷续还；如果是消极拖欠的，则应动员它们归还。对于欠税户，也应暂时安排下来；供销社要同税局研究私商欠税原因，如果是拖延顽抗户，就应动员它们清交；如过去税局对私商的税款确实评议过高，就应该重新审查修正，以便实事求是地处理。
    关于对私商生活安排标准的计算问题：一般应该掌握以他们的营业所得收入基本上可以维持当地居民生活水平为原则；过去有些地区在安排中对私商的营业额扣得过紧，以致他们收入仍不能维持生活，这种偏向应该立即纠正。
    在这次会议上，大家认为：供销合作社开展批发业务，是安排私商工作的重要关键。供销社要根据货源情况和商品流转方向及减少周转环节的要求，把批发机构建立起来。一般地说，县社所在地的集镇，暂时可由县社负责批发，逐步过渡到由基层社来做（因为县社做批发工作，不能充分满足小商小贩对花色品种的要求）；基层社建立批发机构时，也要根据具体情况：如区供销社本身部门较多，私商户数也很多的较大集镇，应该建立专门批发部；集镇较小，私商也少的地方，可由供销社的门市部兼做批发工作，但要有专职干部负责批发业务，以防止批发和零售不分，财务混乱等现象。关于进货计划，对小商小贩可以不要，让他们只做一个“要货单”就可以了。过去有的供销社强调要小商小贩造月度计划，而实际上都不能很好地执行，工作反而被动。对于规模和资金较大的合作小组、经销店及其他单线联系的商户，可以试着让他们编造月度和季度的进货计划，以培养他们经营的计划性，逐步把他们纳入国家计划的轨道。
    供销社是实行独立核算自负盈亏的企业；批发作价问题如果处理不当，供销社就可能赔累。这是非常不利于安排私商工作的。但是，批发作价问题又是一个十分复杂的问题，如果让基层供销社来制定批发价格，那是有困难的。为了比较有把握地解决这个问题，基层社的商品批发价格应由县供销合作社根据当地的具体条件来制定，并经县财委批准以后执行。批发作价的原则应该是在稳定市场物价的前提下，既能促进供销社批发业务的开展，而又能使私商得到合理的利润。
