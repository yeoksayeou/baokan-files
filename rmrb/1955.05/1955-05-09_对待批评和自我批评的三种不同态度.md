　　Three Different Attitudes Towards Criticism and Self-Criticism
　　Ying Lin
    Regularly carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and treating one's own shortcomings and mistakes with a serious and responsible attitude, is a unique style of the working class party. This style ensures that the working class party can discover and correct its shortcomings and mistakes in a timely manner, and ensure that the Party's cause continues to move forward. Lenin said: "All revolutionary parties in the past perished because they were arrogant and could not see where their strength lay, and were afraid to speak of their weaknesses. But we will not perish, because we are not afraid to speak of our weaknesses and can learn to overcome them." Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of our Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we have correctly grasped the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and thus have been able to constantly eliminate shortcomings and mistakes in our work, maintain correct leadership over the masses of people, and enjoy high prestige among the people.
    The Central Committee of our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us that a Communist Party member must constantly improve his ideological consciousness, constantly prevent and overcome complacency, dare to conduct open self-criticism, humbly accept criticism and opinions from all sides, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against his own errors and shortcomings. Only with this spirit of strict criticism and self-criticism can a Communist Party member continuously improve and make useful contributions to the cause of the Party and the people. Conversely, if a Communist Party member has shortcomings or makes mistakes in his work, but does not have the courage to face them, is unwilling to make open self-criticism, is unwilling to accept criticism from superiors and comrades, and even retaliates against critics, this person's mistakes will inevitably become more serious, and he will eventually embark on the criminal road of opposing the Party and the people.
    Regarding the attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, there are three different attitudes within our Party. Some comrades already have a very high level of political and ideological awareness and can conduct strict criticism and self-criticism. As soon as they discover their own shortcomings and mistakes, or if someone points out shortcomings and mistakes to them, they immediately conduct sincere and open self-criticism and resolutely correct their shortcomings and mistakes. At the same time, regarding the shortcomings and mistakes of others, if the mistakes and shortcomings of others are of a general nature, they can, in the spirit of "curing the disease to save the person" and "being kind to others," offer factual criticism to these comrades and patiently help them correct their shortcomings and mistakes. If the mistakes of others are very serious, and they are resisting the Party and refusing to change, they will wage a resolute struggle against them. It must be admitted that at present, within our Party, there are still not many people with this spirit of strict criticism and self-criticism.
    Completely opposite to this attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, there are still a very small number of people who have committed relatively serious mistakes, but resolutely refuse to admit them, and retaliate against critics. If this kind of person still insists on going to the end after repeated criticism and education from the Party, he will inevitably completely degenerate and become an anti-Party and anti-people bad element. In order to maintain the unity and unification of the Party, we must treat them as the mortal enemies of the Party and fight them, and even expel them from the Party. At present, although the anti-Party activities of these anti-Party elements who have been discovered have been completely crushed, it is still possible that a very small number of bad elements with bad qualities are hidden within our Party. This deserves the attention of Party organizations at all levels and every Communist Party member.
    In addition to the above, there is another attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. This is the attitude taken by a considerable number of comrades. They are able to offer correct criticism of the shortcomings and mistakes of others in accordance with the principles of the Party; however, they adopt a forgiving attitude towards their own shortcomings and mistakes. They are unwilling to strictly examine their own shortcomings and mistakes, are unable to conduct open self-criticism, and in particular are unable to humbly accept criticism from below. When others offer criticism or suggestions to these comrades, some "humbly" accept and "sincerely" examine themselves, but resolutely refuse to correct themselves; some seize on individual factual inaccuracies in the criticism and defend themselves in various ways, attempting to shirk responsibility; some, after being criticized, try to emphasize objective difficulties and complain that the critics cannot understand their "hardships"; some even regard comradely criticism as fault-finding, as being against them. In short, these comrades are still somewhat protective of their shortcomings, always trying to find ways to defend their own shortcomings and mistakes, and are unable to humbly accept the criticism of others. People criticize them as: "Marxist-Leninist to others, liberal to oneself."
    There are quite a few comrades who treat criticism in this way, whether in Party organizations or agencies, enterprises, schools, or mass organizations, and whether they are responsible Party cadres or ordinary cadres. For example, since November 1954, the Shenyang Daily has continuously criticized the staff of some hospitals under the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau for using public office for private gain and the departmentalism of some leading comrades of the Health Bureau and other units. These criticisms were consistent with the facts, but they did not seriously examine and correct them. The leading cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau only asked the cadres below to write a self-criticism and send it to the newspaper, simply explained the opinions on improving the work to the cadres, and did not truly solve the problem ideologically. Deputy Director Wei Fangzhong believed that the newspaper's criticism was a "trap set" for them by the correspondents and reporters. Director Li E also said: "These people don't know whether they are collecting materials for the newspaper or helping the bureau improve its work." They did not use the problems criticized by the newspaper to educate the cadres and thoroughly correct the shortcomings and mistakes in their work, but dealt with it perfunctorily and thought that the matter was over. The Shenyang Fourth Hospital, one of the units criticized, wrote a letter to the newspaper in the name of the hospital, without making a self-criticism, but defending the hospital's president's mistake of abusing the ambulance, which was criticized by the newspaper. Obviously, this kind of treating criticism as a "trap" and "finding materials" is like a person who is sick and the doctor wants him to take medicine and injections, but the person suspects the doctor's motives, which is equally wrong.
    Of course, the comrades who treat criticism and self-criticism in this way are very different from those bad elements who suppress democracy and retaliate against critics. Because these comrades generally speaking, are willing to serve the cause of the Party and the people, and many of them have been tested by long-term revolutionary struggles and have proven to be loyal to the Party. However, their ideological style is not pure enough, and there is still more or less bourgeois individualism. They cannot soberly estimate the achievements in their work, and instead of attributing it to the leadership of the Party and the active support of the masses, they overemphasize their personal role. In this way, they begin to become arrogant, believing only in their own strength and not in the strength of the masses. Some think that they have high positions, great power, talent, and experience, and do not believe that they will make mistakes, and carry the burden of being veterans. Therefore, they adopt a rejecting attitude towards criticism from superiors, especially from below, mistakenly thinking that only they can criticize others, and others cannot criticize them. Some people also know that they have shortcomings and mistakes, but they love "face" and are afraid of losing "prestige," so they cannot happily accept criticism and have some resistance. This individualistic complacency is the root cause of why these comrades cannot treat criticism and self-criticism with a completely correct attitude.
    It must be pointed out that although the mistakes of these comrades are not very serious, the individualistic complacency they have shown in criticism and self-criticism is extremely dangerous. If these comrades do not wake up quickly and correct their attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, their small shortcomings will develop into big mistakes, and general mistakes will develop into big principled mistakes. The reason why some people make one mistake after another and become more and more serious is because their individualistic arrogance has not been overcome in time. For example, Zhao Ziying, the former first deputy director of the Kunming Machinery Factory in Yunnan Province and a Communist Party member, implemented a patriarchal rule in the factory because he had serious complacency, did not accept the supervision of the Party and the masses, and the Party branch in his factory relaxed the struggle against his wrong behavior. As a result, he made the serious mistake of openly suppressing democracy and retaliating against critics, and was punished with probation within the Party and administrative demotion.
    From the above three attitudes towards criticism and self-criticism, it can be seen that after long-term revolutionary struggles, our Party has indeed cultivated a group of Party cadres with a high degree of ideological awareness, and their spirit of treating criticism and self-criticism is worthy of everyone's learning; however, the resistance to carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party is still very great. This requires Party organizations at all levels to always assume a major task: on the one hand, to resolutely struggle against anti-Party elements who suppress democracy and retaliate against critics, until they are removed from the Party ranks; on the other hand, to fully promote democracy, adhere to carrying out regular criticism and self-criticism, especially carrying out criticism from below, and at the same time educate all Party members, especially the more responsible comrades, to treat criticism and self-criticism with a correct attitude. To achieve this, the central issue is to continuously improve the political and ideological awareness of Party members and cadres, and make them realize the serious harm of individualistic complacency.

　　对待批评和自我批评的三种不同态度
　　应麟
    经常在党内开展批评和自我批评，用严肃负责的态度对待自身的缺点和错误，是工人阶级的政党特有的作风。这种作风保证了工人阶级的政党能够及时地发现和改正自己的缺点和错误，保证党的事业不断地前进。列宁说过：“从前所有一切革命党陷于灭亡，就是因为它们自傲，而看不见自己力量之所在，害怕说出自己的弱点。而我们是不会灭亡的，因为我们不怕说出自己的弱点，并且能学会克服弱点。”我们党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的正确领导之下，正确地掌握了批评和自我批评的武器，因而能够不断地消除工作中的缺点和错误，经常保持着对人民群众的正确的领导，在人民群众中享有很高的威信。
    我们党的中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们：一个共产党员必须不断地提高自己的思想觉悟，经常防止和克服骄傲自满情绪，勇于进行公开的自我批评，虚心接受来自各方面的批评和意见，同自己的错误和缺点作不调和的斗争。只有具备了这种严格的批评和自我批评的精神，一个共产党员才能不断地得到进步和提高，为党和人民的事业作出有益的贡献。相反的，如果一个共产党员在工作中有了缺点，犯了错误，而没有勇气去正视它们，不愿意作公开的自我批评，不愿意接受上级和同志们的批评，甚至对批评者实行打击和报复，这个人的错误必然会发展得更加严重，最后甚至会走上反党反人民的罪恶道路。
    在对待批评和自我批评的态度上，在我们党内，有三种不同的态度。有一部分同志已经有了很高的政治思想觉悟，能够进行严格的批评和自我批评。当他们一经发现自己的缺点和错误，或者有人向他们提出缺点和错误，他们就立即诚恳地公开地进行自我批评，坚决改正自己的缺点和错误。同时，在对待别人的缺点和错误上，如果别人的错误和缺点是一般性质的，他们能本着“治病救人”和
  “与人为善”的精神，实事求是地向这些同志提出批评，并且耐心地帮助这些同志改正缺点和错误。如果别人的错误是十分严重的，是同党对抗、坚持不改的，他们就对它进行坚决的斗争。应该承认，目前，在我们党内，这种具有严格的批评和自我批评精神的人还是不多的。
    同这种对待批评和自我批评的态度完全相反的，是还有极少数这样的人，他们犯了比较严重的错误，但是坚决不肯承认，并且对批评者实行打击和报复。这种人，如果在受到党的一再的批评和教育以后，仍然要坚持到底，就必然会完全蜕化变质，变成反党反人民的坏分子。为了维护党的团结和统一，我们就要把他们作为党的死敌来进行斗争，甚至把他们驱除出党。目前，对于已经被发现的这种反党分子的反党活动，虽然已经被彻底地粉碎了，但是在我们党内还可能会隐藏着极少数品质恶劣的坏分子。这是值得引起党的各级组织和每一个共产党员注意的。
    除了上面所说的以外，还有另一种对待批评和自我批评的态度。这是相当多数的一部分同志所采取的态度。他们对于别人的缺点和错误，是能够按照党的原则提出正确的批评；但是对于自己的缺点和错误，就采取着原谅的态度。他们不愿意严格地检讨自己的缺点和错误，不能够进行公开的自我批评，特别是不能虚心地接受来自下面的批评。这些同志在别人向他们提出批评或建议的时候，有的是“虚心”接受、“诚恳”检讨，但是坚决不肯改正；有的是抓住批评中个别事实不符的地方，多方为自己辩护，企图推卸责任；有的是在受到批评以后，尽量强调客观困难，埋怨批评者不能体谅他们的“苦衷”；有的甚至把同志式的批评当成是找岔子，是同他们过不去。总之，这些同志还多少有些护短，总是想尽办法为自己的缺点和错误辩护，不能虚心地接受别人的批评。人们批评他们是：“对人马列主义，对己自由主义。”
    用这种态度来对待批评的同志，不论在党的组织或机关、企业、学校和群众团体中，也不论是在负责的党员干部或一般干部中，是很不少的。例如，从一九五四年十一月以来，沈阳日报曾经连续批评了沈阳市卫生局所属部分医院的工作人员假公济私和卫生局等单位的某些领导同志的本位主义。这些批评是符合事实的，但是他们没有认真地去检查和改正。沈阳市卫生局的领导干部只是叫下面的干部写了一个检讨，送给了报社，简单地向干部交代了一下改进工作的意见，并未真正从思想上解决问题。副局长魏方中认为报纸的批评是通讯员和记者给他们“摆的圈套”。局长李鄂也说：“这些人不知道是给报社搜集材料还是帮助局里改进工作。”他们没有用报纸所批评的问题来教育干部，彻底地纠正工作中的缺点和错误，而是马马虎虎地应付一下，就认为事情已经完了。受到批评的单位之一的沈阳市第四医院，则用院的名义给报社写了一封信，没有作自我检讨，反为报纸批评这个医院的院长滥坐救护车的错误辩护。很明显，这种把批评当成“摆圈套”和“找材料”，如同一个人害了病，医生要他吃药打针，而这个人却怀疑起医生的动机来，是一样错误的。
    当然，用这种态度对待批评和自我批评的同志，是同那些压制民主、打击报复批评者的坏分子有很大区别的。因为这些同志一般说来，都是愿意为党和人民的事业服务的，而且其中有不少人还经过长期革命斗争的考验，证明是对党忠诚的。但是他们的思想作风还不够纯正，还或多或少地存在着资产阶级个人主义思想。他们不能清醒地估计工作中的成绩，不是把它归功于党的领导和群众的积极支持，而是过于看重了个人的作用。这样，他们便开始骄傲起来，只相信自己的力量，不相信群众的力量。有的是自以为职位高，权力大，有才干，有经验，不相信自己会犯错误，背上了老资格的包袱。因此他们就对来自上级、特别是来自下面的批评采取了拒绝的态度，错误地以为只有他们能批评别人，别人就不能批评他们。有的人虽然也知道自己有缺点，有错误，但是他们爱“面子”，怕失掉
  “威信”，因而不能愉快地接受批评，多少有一些抵触情绪。这种个人主义的骄傲自满情绪，就是这些同志不能用完全正确的态度对待批评和自我批评的根本原因。
    必须指出，这些同志的错误虽然还不是很严重的，但是他们在批评和自我批评上所表现出来的个人主义的骄傲自满情绪则是极其危险的。如果这些同志不赶快警觉起来，端正对待批评和自我批评的态度，他们的小的缺点就会发展成大的错误，一般性的错误就会发展成大的原则性的错误。有些人所以一错再错，越错越严重，就是因为他们的个人主义骄傲情绪没有得到及时的克服。例如前云南省昆明市机器厂第一副厂长、共产党员赵子英，就是因为他有着严重的骄傲自满情绪，在厂内实行家长式的统治，不接受党和群众的监督，而他所在工厂的党支部又放松了对他的错误行为的斗争，结果就使得他犯了公开压制民主、打击报复批评者的严重错误，受到了留党察看和行政上撤职的处分。
    从上述三种对待批评和自我批评的态度可以看出，我们党经过长期的革命斗争的锻炼以后，固然已经培养出了一批有着高度思想觉悟的党员干部，他们对待批评和自我批评的精神是值得大家学习的；但是在党内开展批评和自我批评的阻力仍然是很大的。这就要求党的各级组织应该经常担负起一项重大的任务：一方面是要坚决同压制民主、打击报复批评者的反党分子作斗争，直至把他们从党的队伍中清除出去；另一方面是要充分发扬民主，坚持开展经常性的批评和自我批评、特别是开展自下而上的批评，同时教育全党同志，特别是比较负责的同志都能以正确的态度对待批评和自我批评。要作到这一点，中心问题是要不断地提高党员、干部的政治思想觉悟，使他们认识到个人主义骄傲自满情绪的严重危害性。
