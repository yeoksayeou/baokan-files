　　Changing the Natural Appearance of Shanxi Province

　　I
　　Shanxi Province has many mountains, many rivers, and much land suitable for forestry. Except for forty-seven counties which are basically plains or semi-mountainous areas, the remaining forty-eight counties are mountainous areas, covering approximately 113,000 square kilometers, accounting for 72.5% of the province's total area. The main rivers flowing through the province are the Yellow River, Fen River, Sanggan River, and Hutuo River. The province currently has 10 million mu of forest, while the area suitable for forestry is over 70 million mu. However, due to the long-term devastation of feudal rule and the destruction of war, the forests and grasslands of Shanxi Province have suffered great losses, and most mountainous areas have become barren. Consequently, soil erosion is severe, and floods occur frequently. More than 80% of the province's river flow is not utilized, and the rivers also carry away large amounts of fertile topsoil, damaging many fertile fields. According to measurements by the Henan Province Shanxian Hydrological Station, the Yellow River carries away 1.38 billion tons of sediment annually, of which about 12.5% comes from the Shanxi area. Including the erosion from other rivers in the province, Shanxi loses at least 300 million tons of soil annually. If this soil were spread to a thickness of one foot, it could cover an area of 800,000 mu. Erosion in the upper reaches of the rivers inevitably raises the riverbeds downstream, making floods more likely. The rise in riverbeds also raises the groundwater level near the rivers, promoting soil alkalization. In Qingxu County, the Fen River's riverbed has gradually risen over the past forty years, now being one zhang and five chi higher than the city wall and four zhang and five chi higher than the rooftops. Currently, half of Qingxu County city is uninhabitable, and 35,000 mu of good land near the county seat have been turned into barren, waterlogged, and alkaline land. The scarcity of forests and severe soil erosion in Shanxi Province have adversely affected the increase in agricultural products and timber. Therefore, how to do a good job in soil and water conservation and fully develop and utilize the province's natural resources has become the key to changing the face of mountainous areas, developing agricultural production, and improving the living standards of people in mountainous areas.
　　II
　　Soil and water conservation is a comprehensive construction effort involving agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. To carry out this work effectively, it is necessary to have comprehensive planning and unified arrangements to achieve the greatest results. This means that based on local conditions, planning must be carried out in a comprehensive, planned, and focused manner from the mountaintop to the bottom of the gully, arranging farmland, pasture, and forest land correctly, and organizing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production rationally, so that soil and water conservation work serves agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. When Shanxi Province began soil and water conservation work, it did not clearly recognize the importance of this issue. The agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy sectors all worked in isolation, each with its own focus, without any connection to each other, so the soil and water conservation work did not achieve the desired results. For example, in Shannandi Village in Pingshun County, no afforestation or grass cultivation was done on the mountains, and only more than 20 mu of silted beach land projects were built at the foot of the mountain. As a result, because there was no cover on the mountain, the rainwater rushed down too quickly, and a flood washed away the silted beach project. In Baijiagou in Xing County, to silt up the gully, an earthen dam was built alone in the main gully, costing more than 200 labor days. However, when the rainy season came, the rainwater rushed straight down, and before the soil could be silted up, the dam was washed away. In Qingxu, Youyu, and other places, many check dam projects were also destroyed in 1952 and 1953 because comprehensive planning and planned soil and water conservation work were not carried out.
　　The soil and water conservation work in Shanxi Province has been advancing by constantly overcoming shortcomings. In recent years, Shanxi Province has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and accepted the lessons of the past, thereby improving soil and water conservation work. Many examples of comprehensively carrying out soil and water conservation work and effectively building mountainous areas have emerged throughout the province. Qiaomai Chuan Village in Hunyuan County used to have more than 5,000 mu of land. Due to severe soil erosion, the cultivated land was constantly decreasing. Before the war, only 3,600 mu were left. Half of the 1,300 mu of land that was lost became sand slopes, and half was washed into gullies. In sixteen or seventeen years, more than 100 gullies more than one zhang wide appeared in the village. In 1954, on the basis of collectivization in the village, the village carried out soil and water conservation work in a planned manner after comprehensive planning, sowing tree seeds on barren mountains, planting trees, digging intercepting ditches, building terraces, and building check dams. After adopting these methods, the topsoil of eight gully slopes has been controlled, initially achieving "water not leaving the plateau and soil not leaving the slope," and 60 mu of flat slope land has been silted up, and 30 mu of good land has been silted up. Yangjingdi Village in Pingshun County, after comprehensive surveying and specific planning, divided the village's land into three areas: agriculture, forestry, and grazing. In 1954, soil and water conservation work such as closing hillsides for afforestation, planting trees, building check dams, and building reservoirs was carried out. In the past, whenever mountain torrents broke out, the rapid flow of the Liyuan River would carry a large amount of sediment and rush down, destroying fields. In 1954, although there was a rainstorm unseen in a century, the river water was only three or four chi deep, and the amount of sediment carried in the water was very small. Forty days after the rain, clear water was still flowing, and more than ten mu of good land was silted up. In addition, the Xigou Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, the Nuanquan Agricultural Cooperative in Baode County, Shiyuan Village in Yushe County, Bianzhai Township in Tunliu County, and Xiling Township in Yanggao County have all made great achievements in soil and water conservation work.
　　In the few years since liberation, Shanxi Province has afforested nearly 2 million mu, closed hillsides for afforestation of more than 3.5 million mu, built 21,766 check dam projects, and built more than 1.24 million water storage ponds, intercepting ditches, and dam construction projects, controlling a total river basin area of more than 2,200 square kilometers. These construction projects have initially played the role of intercepting sand and flood, ensuring the year-by-year improvement of agricultural production, promoting the development of forestry, animal husbandry, and other diversified production. The natural appearance of the mountainous areas has begun to change, and many poor gullies have become rich gullies.
　　III
　　The soil and water conservation work in Shanxi Province, especially in the past year and after the Provincial People's Congress in 1954, has entered a stage of comprehensive planning and planned development. In order to do a good job in this work, the existing advanced experience in soil and water conservation work has been widely publicized and promoted in various places. In August 1954, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial People's Government, and the Provincial Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy organs absorbed technicians and professors from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Shanxi Agricultural College, Renmin University of China, and other units to jointly organize a mountainous area construction inspection team. In addition to conducting general inspections in Ningwu, Shenchi, Wuzhai, Hequ, and other places, it also conducted key inspections in Baode, Xing County, Lin County, and other places, providing a lot of valuable information for carrying out comprehensive soil and water conservation work. At present, Shanxi Province has formulated a longer-term soil and water conservation work plan, and various counties in mountainous areas have also formulated their own soil and water conservation work plans based on the provincial plan and combined with local conditions. Baode, Tianzhen, and other counties have organized training for soil and water conservation work cadres, visits, and publicity to promote advanced experience. Twenty-two counties including Heshun are preparing to build soil and water conservation stations. In order to strengthen the leadership of soil and water conservation work, the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to focus on thirteen townships including Xigou and Yangjingdi, and carry out soil and water conservation work throughout the county from point to area. In order to overcome the shortcomings of general leadership, various places have adopted a zoning and classification leadership method for soil and water conservation work, as well as other agricultural production. Based on the natural conditions of Shanxi, the province is divided into three types of areas: loess hilly areas, barren mountainous areas, and river valley gully areas. Different measures are taken according to the different characteristics of each area. For example, the characteristics of loess hilly areas are: loose soil, lack of trees and grass, and easy erosion. In these areas, the main tasks are to build check dams, build terraces, build embankments, plant trees, and cultivate grass to gradually change the land use methods. In barren mountainous areas and river valley gully areas, afforestation, building check dams, building terraces, preventing floods and consolidating slopes, and building dams to protect banks are also carried out according to their respective characteristics. According to this zoning and classification method of soil and water conservation, it is estimated that by 1957, the province will complete soil and water conservation on 8 million mu of land, and by 1960, it can basically complete the soil and water conservation work in severely eroded areas throughout the province. Fifteen to twenty years later, Shanxi Province will be able to complete the plan to expand the forest area by 40 million mu, rotate or sow pasture grass on 60 million mu, and build soil and water conservation projects to control more than 59 million mu of land. By that time, barren mountains will be covered in green, muddy water will become clear water, droughts, floods and other disasters will be greatly reduced, agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production will be greatly developed, and people's lives will be greatly improved. Farmers in Pingshun, Hunyuan, Yicheng, Baode, and other places have great expectations for soil and water conservation work. They describe the beautiful vision of more than ten years later in this way: Distant mountains and high mountains are forest mountains, nearby mountains and low mountains are flower and fruit mountains, dry river dams become slow beaches, horizontal gullies are built into rice and grain fields, pasture grass is planted in slope depressions, and gentle slopes in the mountains become terraces. Sideline occupations at home raise pigs and chickens, and herds of cattle and sheep are all over the mountains. The comprehensive construction of mountainous areas is good, and a happy life lasts forever!

　　改变山西省的自然面貌
　　郭石
　　一
    山西省山多水多宜林地多，全省除四十七个县基本上是平原或半山区外，其余四十八个县都是山区，约有十一万三千多平方公里，占全省总面积的百分之七十二点五。流经省内的主要河流有黄河、汾河、桑乾河、滹沱河等。全省现有森林一千万亩，而宜林面积在七千万亩以上。但是，由于过去封建统治的长期摧残和战争的破坏，山西省的森林、草坡遭受了很大损失，大部山区变成童山秃岭，因而水土流失严重，洪水泛滥不断发生。全省河流的百分之八十以上的流量未被利用，同时河水还带走了大量的肥沃表土，损坏了很多良田。根据河南省陕县水文站测量，黄河每年带走的泥沙达十三亿八千万吨，其中从山西地区带走的泥沙约占百分之十二点五；加上全省其他河流的冲刷，山西每年至少要流失泥土三亿吨以上。如果把这些泥土按一尺的厚度铺起来，就能铺成八十万亩大的面积。河流上游冲刷，下游河床必然增高，这就使洪水更易泛滥成灾。河床提高的结果使河流附近地下水位随着提高，促使土地碱化。清徐县境内的汾河，近四十年来河床逐渐加高，河床比城墙高一丈五尺，比房顶高出四丈五尺，现在清徐县城半个城不敢住人，县城附近的三万五千亩好地变成了荒涝碱滩。山西省森林稀少和严重的水土流失，使得农产品和木材的增产都受到很不利的影响。因此如何做好水土保持工作，充分开发利用省内的天然富源，就成为改变山区面貌、发展农业生产、提高山区人民生活水平的关键。
　　二
    水土保持是农、林、牧、水利四个方面综合性的建设工作。开展这一工作，必须进行全面规划，统一安排，方能收到最大效果。这就是说，必须按当地具体条件，从山顶到沟底，由上而下，分段分片，有计划地集中地进行规划，正确地布置农田、牧场、林地，合理地组织农、林、牧业的生产，使水土保持工作为农、林、牧业生产服务。山西省在开始进行水土保持工作的时候，由于没有明确认识到这个问题的重要性，农、林、牧、水利几方面，都孤立地进行工作，各有各的重点，彼此互不联系，因而使水土保持工作没有收到应有的效果。如平顺县山南底村，没有在山上造林、育草，单纯地在山下修了二十多亩淤滩漫地的工程，结果由于山上没有覆盖，雨水冲流过急，一场洪水就把淤滩工程冲光了。兴县白家沟为了淤沟，单独在主沟打土坝一座，费工二百多个；但是雨季一到，雨水直上直下地猛冲，土未淤成坝就被水冲走了。清徐、右玉等地在一九五二年和一九五三年由于没有进行全面规划和有计划地进行水土保持工作，不少谷坊工程也都被冲毁了。
    山西省的水土保持工作，就是在不断地克服缺点中前进的。几年来，山西省学习了苏联的先进经验，接受了过去的教训，从而改进了水土保持工作；全省已涌现出不少的全面进行水土保持工作、卓有成效地建设山区的范例。浑源县荞麦川村过去有土地五千多亩，由于水土流失严重，耕地不断减少，战前只剩下三千六百亩，减少的一千三百亩地中间，半数变成了沙坡，半数冲成了沟壑，在十六、七年里，全村出现了一丈多宽的沟壑一百多条。一九五四年在全村合作化的基础上，这个村经过全面规划，有计划地开展了水土保持工作，在荒山上播种树籽，插木植树，开挖截水沟、修梯田、修谷坊等。采用这些办法后，已控制了八道沟坡的表土，初步做到了“水不下塬，土不下坡”，并淤出平坡地六十亩，淤出好地三十亩。平顺县羊井底村经过全面勘测和具体规划，把全村土地划分为农业、林业、放牧等三个区，一九五四年并进行了封山育林、栽树、修谷坊、修蓄水池等水土保持工作。过去这个村每逢山洪暴发，梨园河湍急的水流便挟带大量泥沙奔流而来，冲坏田园；一九五四年虽遭百年未见的大雨，河水也仅有三、四尺深，水里携带的泥沙极少，雨后四十多天仍流清水，并淤出好地十余亩。此外如平顺县西沟农林牧生产合作社、保德县暖泉农业社，榆社县的石源村、屯留县的边寨乡、阳高县的西岭乡等，都在水土保持工作方面，做出了很大成绩。
    解放后几年来，山西省造林近二百万亩，封山育林三百五十多万亩，做谷坊工程二万一千七百六十六座，修建蓄水池、截水沟、闸山筑坝等工程一百二十四万多项，控制各河流域面积二千二百多平方公里。这些建设工程已初步发挥了拦沙拦洪的效果，保证了农业生产的逐年提高，促进了林业、牧畜等多种生产的发展，山区的自然面貌已在开始改变，很多穷沟已经变成了富沟。三    山西省的水土保持工作，过去一年来，特别是在一九五四年省人民代表大会以后，已经进入了全面规划和有计划开展的阶段。为了做好这一工作，各地广泛宣传推广了已有的先进的水土保持工作的经验。一九五四年八月，中共山西省委、省人民政府、省农林水利机关吸收华北农业科学研究所、山西农学院、中国人民大学等单位的技术人员和教授，共同组织了山区建设考察组，除在宁武、神池、五寨、河曲等地做了一般考察外，并在保德、兴县、临县等地进行了重点考察，为全面进行水土保持工作提供了很多宝贵的资料。目前山西省已订出较长期的水土保持工作计划，山区各县也根据省的计划结合当地情况制定了本县的水土保持工作计划。保德、天镇等县组织了水土保持工作干部训练、参观、宣传推广先进经验等工作。和顺等二十二个县正在筹建水土保持站。中共平顺县委为了加强对水土保持工作的领导，已确定以西沟、羊井底等十三个乡为重点，由点到面地开展全县的水土保持工作。为了克服领导一般化的缺点，各地对水土保持工作也同其他农业生产一样，采取了分区分类的领导方法，根据山西的自然条件，全省共分为黄土丘陵区、荒山区和河谷沟道区三类地区，根据各区的不同特点，采取不同的措施。例如黄土丘陵区的特点是：土壤松疏，树少草缺，容易冲刷。在这类地区主要地是建谷坊、修梯田、垒岸筑坝、植树养草，逐步改变土地利用方式。在荒山区和河谷沟道区，也按其特点分别进行封山育林、修谷坊、垒梯田、拦洪固坡、打坝护岸等工作。根据这种分区分类进行水土保持的方法，预计到一九五七年全省将完成水土保持面积八百万亩，在一九六○年以前基本上可以完成全省水土流失严重地区的水土保持工作。十五年至二十年以后，山西省将可以完成扩大森林面积四千万亩、轮封或播种牧草六千万亩、修建控制五千九百多万亩土地面积的水土保持工程的计划。到那时候，童山秃岭都将穿上绿色的盛装，浑水将变成清流，旱、涝等灾害将大大减少，农、林、牧业生产都将会大大发展，人民生活也将会大大改善。平顺、浑源、翼城、保德等地农民对水土保持工作寄予极大的希望，他们这样描述着十几年后的美好远景：远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山，干河大坝变漫滩，横沟修成米粮川，坡凹地里种牧草，山腰缓坡变梯田，家中副业养猪鸡，牛羊成群遍满山，山区全面建设好，幸福生活万万年！
