　　When I Was With Czechoslovak Workers
　　Ai Wu
    In the town of Třinec, in the northern border region of Czechoslovakia, I spent two days visiting the Molotov Metallurgical Plant, accompanied day and night by Jan Mízner and two other Czechoslovak comrades. Jan Mízner was a middle-aged worker of forty, with dark, slightly yellowing hair and prominent wrinkles on his forehead. But when he shook your hand with his large, powerful hands, you could feel his robust health. He liked to tell jokes, but he himself didn't laugh much. His home was filled with Chinese items: a beautiful Hangzhou silk umbrella, a lovely black Fushun jet lion, delicate Shanghai ivory fans, and Chinese paintings on the wall. He pointed to his daughter, who had just returned from school, and said:
    "Look, her red scarf was given to me by your Young Pioneers, and I brought it back for her."
    Seeing these things from the motherland in the home of a Czechoslovak worker so far from China was surprising and joyful. I asked Jan Mízner, "When did you go to China?"
    "In 1953, I represented the workers of Czechoslovakia at the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions convened by your All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and after the meeting, I visited many places," Jan Mízner said with great interest, talking about his trip to China.
    Turning to his past, Jan Mízner recounted how he often faced unemployment when working in the factory in the old days. Both he and his father were workers in the factory, his father working in coke production, and he as a bricklayer. During the First Republic era, both father and son were Communists, and when the factory needed to lay off workers, they would be the first to suffer unemployment. During the dark days of the Hitlerite bandits' rule over Czechoslovakia, he was captured and forced to work as a coolie in Germany. Later, when the German bandits were short of soldiers, they forced him to enlist. He deserted to the Soviet side at the front, went to Hungary, and only returned after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. At that time, the factory was nationalized. He served as the chairman of the workshop trade union, the secretary of the workshop branch, and later as the chairman of the Těšín District Trade Union and the chairman of the District Defense Committee. During his series of administrative positions, he constantly studied the various equipment of the factory and put forward many rationalization proposals. In 1949, the factory asked him to become a technician, and now he specializes in the technical inspection of the factory, leading the work of more than one hundred technical inspectors. His famous and effective rationalization proposal came in 1952, when he solved the important problem of the steel ladle, receiving a national medal and bonus.
    This factory is one of the oldest in Czechoslovakia, established in 1835, and it fell into the hands of foreign capitalists several times. Because there were coal and iron mines near the factory, foreign capitalists all wanted to get their hands on it. After the end of World War I in 1918, France and Italy even sent troops to be stationed here and did not want to leave. In 1938, the German bandits occupied Těšín County and seized the factory. After liberation, the factory was nationalized and renamed the Molotov Metallurgical Plant in 1948. The government of the Czechoslovak Republic greatly rebuilt and expanded it, first adding two large blast furnaces, one of which is considered the largest in Central Europe. A new ore dressing plant, a power plant, and two open-hearth furnace workshops were also built, all equipped with the latest equipment. For example, various raw materials for steelmaking are delivered directly to the upper floor of the open-hearth furnace workshop by train. Ingots are not cast in the pits of the ingot casting shop, but on trains, and are transported away as soon as they are cast. At the same time, the steel ladle was also changed to be able to hold two hundred tons of molten steel. The entire reconstruction and expansion work was completed in sequence, but problems arose after the large ladle was enlarged. When the ladle was loaded with two hundred tons of molten steel, the weight was heavy and the heat was fierce. When a crane was used to hoist it to the steel mold for casting ingots, the eye under the ladle was burned by the flowing molten steel, becoming larger and larger. It could not cast ingots and rushed to the ground, causing huge losses. If the ladle was not enlarged, it would not meet the demand, affecting the normal production of the open-hearth furnace. The factory leadership called on all employees to find ways to solve this difficulty. Jan Mízner studied using a refractory material to make the ladle's eye, and the result was very good. This advanced experience was also promoted to other steel factories.
    After Jan Mízner finished talking about his past work, he said to me:
    "Today, no matter how tired our workers are, they are willing to do it. The working conditions in the factory are very good, and the sanitary ventilation equipment is extremely complete, and every worker is very healthy. If it were the old days, it would have been unbearable." Then, pointing to his father, who suffered from asthma, he said: "The old man got sick in the coke oven before liberation. At that time, the equipment was extremely bad, the coke oven smoked everywhere, and nine out of ten workers suffered from asthma."
    Jan Mízner's father sat next to him, gasping for breath, and said emotionally:
    "If it hadn't been for liberation, I would have been finished long ago. Now I can't work, the government gives me a pension of 600 crowns a month, and I live very well. I don't have any other activities, I just attend Party meetings. When the weather is clear, I go outside to walk around and let my chest feel better. Sometimes I turn on the radio and listen to the broadcast. I know about your Five-Year Plan, a lot of which I heard on the radio. Your Chinese workers, like our Czechoslovak workers, are seeing their lives get better day by day. This is my greatest happiness. Those dark days of the past will never come back. As a worker and as a Communist, I have suffered enough from the pain of unemployment and persecution. Today, I am finally doing well, and I can see the society I have longed for for many years with my own eyes." He looked at his son with satisfaction, and after a moment of breathing, he continued: "Now our Czechoslovak workers are indeed working very hard. In the past ten years, the changes in our factory have been too great. Now, if I want to go to the factory, I have to ask my son to lead me, otherwise I will get lost. The factory has changed not only in appearance, but also internally. Even the factory director is from our workers, so how can the factory not be run well!" He then praised the workers in the factory with an admiring tone, saying: "Many model workers have emerged from the workers. Thirty people have won medals from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Mining. I know that the most outstanding among them is the steelworker Kondra, who in 1954 refined two hundred tons of molten steel in one furnace in six hours and ten minutes, setting the highest record. The turner Kashek is able to operate two different lathes at the same time, completing five years of work in two years."
    Jan Mízner, hearing his father praising the workers in the factory, happily interjected to me:
    "General Josef Hečko, the Czechoslovak representative on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, used to work as a worker in our factory."
    Old Mízner smiled and said:
    "Before liberation, some of our factory's workers had also been to foreign countries, but they were not there as representatives. It was very pitiful. They couldn't survive in Czechoslovakia, so they went abroad to wander. Thinking of the era of capitalist rule, it is really infuriating. Workers would be fired immediately for any violation of the rules, and many people would leave their homes and wander abroad. Today, if a worker does a bad job, they are only educated and persuaded. Everyone's work is guaranteed and their lives are good, so who wouldn't work hard? Our government has built many houses for the workers in the factory. The houses built in the ten years since liberation are more than the capitalists built in a hundred years, and they are better built than the capitalists. Previously, four families lived in four rooms in the workers' residences. Now, only one family lives in four or five rooms. Look at this house, it's where my son lives, and I live in another house. I heard that there were Chinese guests coming, so I came over."
    "The factory is also building a long row of four-story buildings on a large scale. In addition to providing each family upstairs with a basement for storing items, there is also a public electric laundry room. You only need to turn on the motor to wash clothes automatically and dry them automatically. When ironing clothes, you only need to turn on the electric roller. In addition, in the most beautiful valley in Rzeka, 18 kilometers from the factory, a state-of-the-art workers' sanatorium was built. Each room has sanitary bathing facilities. I stayed in this sanatorium for two nights."
    I learned that the factory's welfare facilities are very good today, precisely because the workers have won victories on the production front.
    Old Mízner then asked with great concern about the lives of Chinese workers and the general people.
    Jan Mízner told me:
    "Since I returned from China, I have given forty-seven reports, and people are eager to invite me. Last year, I went to a sanatorium in Slovakia for a vacation. The local garrison knew that I had been to China, so they pulled me to their barracks and stayed for three days to talk to them about China." Then he joked, "I'm a little afraid of giving reports now. Every time I give a report, I have fewer Chinese gifts to bring back."
    He didn't laugh at all, but made others laugh.
    Jan Mízner continued, "I am like this. I not only want people to hear that China is good, but also to see some good Chinese things. They saw the photos and the things made in China, and I think the effect is very good. They truly understand the new China. But some of them really want to get some Chinese things as souvenirs, how can you refuse that?" Then he joked about his Shanghai fan and Fushun lion: "If I report any more, these won't be kept."
    Jan Mízner was full of enthusiasm for China. When he led me to visit the factory, he talked about the cooling equipment of the blast furnace and open-hearth furnace, which requires a large amount of ice every day, and said yearningly: "It would be great if we had a river as big as the Yangtze River here."
    The result of the reconstruction and expansion of the Molotov Metallurgical Plant in the past ten years has made the local iron ore insufficient to meet the demand. Now the ore for iron and steelmaking in the factory also comes from China. China's rich resources belong to the Chinese people, and can be used by the workers of Czechoslovakia. The workers of Czechoslovakia are all very happy about this. I think they love China just as the Chinese people love their own country. When some model workers asked about their advanced experiences, they always introduced them in detail, hoping to truly help the Chinese worker comrades. Like Jan Mízner himself, he not only kindly answered my various questions, but also gave me a Czech booklet recording his advanced experiences. Every worker's family I visited took out ham, sausage, bread, candy, and wine to treat me, and raised their glasses to toast the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples. I don't drink alcohol, but seeing their enthusiasm, and knowing that they refine steel to make machines and transport them to China, which is of great help to the Chinese people in building a socialist society, I couldn't help but drink with them to the bottom, thanking them for their deep friendship.
    On the day I left Třinec, Jan Mízner also accompanied me by car for more than a hundred kilometers, and took me all the way to the military coal mine in Ostrava before saying goodbye and returning. This enthusiasm was very touching.

　　我同捷克斯洛伐克工人在一起的时候
　　艾芜
    在捷克斯洛伐克北部边境崔南慈地方，我参观了莫洛托夫冶金工厂，共有两天的时间，都是由杨·米泽纳和另外两位捷克斯洛伐克的同志，日夜陪着。杨·米泽纳是个四十岁的中年工人，头发黑而微黄，额上有着显著的皱纹。但一双大而有力的手，同你握手的时候，你会感到他的身体壮健。他喜欢说笑话，自己却并不怎样笑。他家里摆了不少中国东西，漂亮的杭州小绸伞，黑得可爱的抚顺炭精狮子，小巧精致的上海牙骨扇子，壁上还挂着中国画。他又指着他刚放学回来的女儿说：
    “你瞧，她的红领巾，还是你们少先队员送我，我带回来送她的。”
    在离中国这么远的一个捷克斯洛伐克工人家里，看见祖国的一些东西，感到惊奇，也感到喜悦。我问杨·米泽纳：“你什么时候到过中国？”
    “一九五三年我代表捷克斯洛伐克的工人，参加过你们全国总工会召开的中国工会第七次全国代表大会，会后又参观过好些地方。”杨·米泽纳很有兴味地谈到他来过中国的事情。
    话头转到他的过去，杨·米泽纳回叙起旧时候在工厂工作常常遭到失业的情形。他和他的父亲都是厂里的工人，父亲炼焦，他作瓦工，在第一共和国时代，父子两人就是共产党员，工厂要裁减工人的时候，他们便会首先遭到失业的灾难。希特勒匪徒统治捷克斯洛伐克那些黑暗日子，他曾被抓到德国去作苦工，德寇后来兵源缺乏，又强迫他去当兵，他在前线逃到苏联那边，转到匈牙利，捷克斯洛伐克解放后，他才回来。当时工厂收归国有，他在工厂担任车间工会主席、车间支部书记，后又任吉辛县的县工会主席和县保卫委员会主席。就在他一连串担任行政工作期间，他不断地研究工厂的各种设备，提出不少合理化建议，一九四九年工厂便要他作技术员，现在则专任厂里技术检查一职，领导一百多名技术检查人员的工作。他的有名的而且收到成效的合理化建议，便是在一九五二年的时候，解决了装钢水大罐的重要问题，得到国家的奖章和奖金。
    这个工厂是捷克斯洛伐克最老的一个厂，在一八三五年即已建立，几次落到外国资本家手中。因为工厂附近有煤矿铁矿，外国资本家都想得到。一九一八年第一次世界大战结束，法国和意大利都还派兵驻扎在这里不想离开。一九三八年德寇占领吉辛县，即将工厂夺去。解放后，工厂收归国有，一九四八年改名莫洛托夫冶金工厂。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府，即大事改建扩充，首先添建两个很大的高炉，其中一个，即在中欧来说，也算是最大的。又新建一个选矿厂，一个发电厂，和两个平炉间，而且设备都是最新式的。像炼钢的各种原料，直接由火车送到平炉间的楼上。铸锭不是在铸锭间的地坑里，而是铸在火车上，刚一铸完，即行运走。同时装钢水的大罐，也改成了能装二百吨钢水。整个改建和扩大工作，都顺序告成，唯有这种大罐改大后，发生了问题。就是大罐装二百吨钢水，重量既大，热力又猛，用吊车吊去钢模上铸锭，大罐底下的眼子，被流出的钢水烧坏，越来越大，不能铸锭、且冲到地上，造成巨大的损失。如果大罐不改大，却又供不应求，影响平炉不能照常生产。工厂领导上便号召全体职工设法解决这一困难，杨·米泽纳研究用一种耐火材料来作大罐眼子，结果效果很好，还把这一先进经验推广到别的钢铁工厂去。
    杨·米泽纳讲完他过去一些工作情形，对我说：
      “今天我们工人再累，也是心甘情愿的，厂里工作条件很好，卫生通风设备都极齐全，个个工人都很健康。要是以前么，可就够受了。”接着指他患气喘病的父亲说：“他老人家就是解放前在炼焦炉上得的病，那时候设备坏极了，炼焦炉到处冒烟，工人十有九个害了气喘病。”
    杨·米泽纳的父亲气喘喘地坐在旁边感动地说：
      “要是不解放，那我也就早完了。现在我不能工作，政府给我一月六百克朗养老金，我过得很好。我别的活动都没有，就只参加党的会议，晴天我到外面走走，让胸口好过一点。有时我也开开收音机，听听广播，我知道你们五年建设计划的情形，好多都是广播上听来的。你们中国工人也同我们捷克斯洛伐克工人一样，生活一天天地变好，这是我最大的快乐。以往那些黑暗日子，永远不会再回来了。作为一个工人、又作为一个共产党员，我受够了失业和迫害的痛苦。今天我总算好，多年想望的社会、能够亲眼看见。”他很满意地望着他的儿子，喘息一会之后，继续说下去：“如今我们捷克斯洛伐克工人，也的确干得很起劲，十年来，我们这个工厂变化实在太大了，现在我要到工厂去看，也得叫我儿子带领，不然就会迷失了路。工厂不仅外貌改变，就连内部也改变了。你想连厂长也是我们工人出身的，这怎么不会把工厂办好呢！”他随又带着夸奖的口气，称赞厂里的工人说：“工人里面出了不少劳动模范。获得冶金工业与采矿部奖章的就有三十人。我知道其中最特出的炼钢工人康德拉，曾在一九五四年用六点十分的时间炼出二百吨一炉的钢水。造成最高纪录。旋工卡舍克能够同时操纵两台不同的车床，两年完成了五年计划的工作。”
    杨·米泽纳听见父亲夸奖厂里工人，高兴地插嘴向我说：
      “在朝鲜中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克代表约瑟夫·赫契柯将军，就在我们工厂作过工人。”
    老米泽纳笑着说：
      “解放前，我们工厂的工人，也有到过外国的，那可不是做什么代表，说来可怜的很，那是在捷克斯洛伐克活不下去了，才到外国去流浪。想起资本家统治时代，真叫人忿怒，工人一犯规，就马上开除，好多人离乡背井，流浪到外国去。今天工人做坏了工作，只是进行教育、说服他。个个人工作都有保障，生活又好，谁不使劲干？我们政府给厂里工人修了许多住宅，解放十年来修的房子，就比资本家一百年修的还多，也比资本家修的好。先前工人住宅，四间屋子就住四家人，现在四五间屋子才住一家人。你看这座房子，是我儿子住的，我还另外住一座房子。我听见有中国客人来了，我才过来的。”
    “厂里还在大规模修建一长列一长列四层楼的房子，地下室除了供给楼上各家作储藏物品之用外，还设有公共的电气洗衣房，只消把电机扭开，即能自动洗衣，自动烘干。烫衣服的时候，也只是扭开电滚就可以了。另外在离工厂十八公里的惹卡地方，选择风景最美丽的山谷，修了一座最新式的工人休养所，每间房间内都有卫生洗澡设备。我就在这个休养所住过两夜。”
    我了解到今天工厂的福利设施很好，正是由于工人在生产战线上得到了胜利。
    老米泽纳随又很关切地问到中国工人和一般人民的生活。
    杨·米泽纳告诉我说：
    “我从中国回来，作过四十七次报告，都是人家争着来请。去年到斯洛伐克一个休养所去度假期，当地的驻军知道我到过中国，就拉我去他们兵营里住了三天，同他们谈论中国的事情。”跟着又打趣地说：“我现在都有点怕做报告了。做一回报告，我带回来的中国礼品就少一回”。
    他一点也不笑，却惹的别人笑了起来。
    杨·米泽纳接着说：“我这个人就是这样的，不只是让人家听见中国好，还要让人家看见一些中国的好东西。他们看见了照片，又看见中国制造的东西，我觉得效果很好。他们真正认识了新的中国。可是他们有些人又很想得到一点中国东西，作为纪念，这你好拒绝吗？”接着又指他的上海扇子抚顺狮子这类东西开玩笑地说：“要是再报告下去，这些也保不住了”。
    杨·米泽纳对中国充满了热情，领我参观工厂的时候，说到高炉平炉的冷却设备，每天需要大量的冰，就向往地说：“我们这里要是有扬子江那样大的河就好了”。
    莫洛托夫冶金工厂十年来改建和扩大的结果，使得当地出产的铁矿石，已供不应求，现在厂里炼铁炼钢的矿石，有好些还来自中国。中国丰富的资源，归于中国人民所有，而又能供捷克斯洛伐克的工人使用，这是捷克斯洛伐克的工人都感到无限高兴的。我觉得他们喜爱中国，正和中国人民喜爱自己的国家一样。一些劳动模范问到他们的先进经验，他们总很详细地介绍出来，希望对中国的工人同志确实会起帮助的作用。像杨·米泽纳自己，不仅亲切地回答我各种问题，还把一本记载有他的先进经验的捷克文小册子送给我。我所访问的每个工人家庭，都拿出火腿、腊肠、面包、糖果和葡萄酒来招待，还要举起杯来，为中捷两国人民牢不可破的友谊热烈地干杯。我不会饮酒，但见他们这样热情，同时又知道，他们炼出钢铁制造机器，运到中国来，对于中国人民建设社会主义社会，有着巨大的帮助，便不能不同他们一道，一饮而尽，感谢他们深厚的友谊。
    我离开崔南慈那一天，杨·米泽纳还陪我坐汽车走了百多公里，一直把我送到奥斯特拉瓦的军人煤矿，才告别回去，这种热情是很令人感动的。
