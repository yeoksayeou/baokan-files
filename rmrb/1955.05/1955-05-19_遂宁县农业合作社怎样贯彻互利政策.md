How the Suining County Agricultural Cooperative Implements the Mutually Beneficial Policy
Ji Jie, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Suining Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China

Last fall, more than 600 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Suining County, Sichuan Province, did not earnestly implement the mutually beneficial policy in terms of pricing draft animals, production investment, and land valuation. As a result, many problems existed within the cooperatives, affecting the production enthusiasm of the members. To consolidate these newly established cooperatives, the Suining County Committee of the Communist Party of China vigorously carried out work to rectify the cooperatives during the spring plowing season this year. After rectification, the unity of poor and middle peasants was strengthened, and the spring plowing production work achieved relatively good results.

During the establishment of the cooperatives last year, many cooperatives implemented the method of pricing draft cattle for ownership by the cooperative too early; the general price of draft cattle was 5 to 10 yuan lower than the market price, and the payment period was too long. As a result, many cattle owners were unwilling to take good care of their draft cattle (after the draft cattle were priced for ownership by the cooperative, the cattle owners were still responsible for raising them). Some cattle owners said, "If the cattle die, I only get one share, see what the cooperative can do!" Of the 22 cattle priced for entry into the cooperative in Hengshan Township, 15 were emaciated and 4 died. Some members of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, fearing that the price of cattle would be set low and unfavorable in the future, also sold their cattle. Yang Liancheng, a middle peasant in the second village of Lianhua Township, sold his cattle before asking to join the cooperative, fearing that he would suffer losses in the future. When rectifying the agricultural production cooperatives, the leadership proposed that the unreasonable practice of pricing draft cattle should be corrected. Initially, many staff members had ideological resistance. Some were afraid of trouble, saying, "Moving one vine moves the whole melon patch, it has already been evaluated, why bother correcting it and looking for trouble?" Some said, "People are already asleep, we have to wake them up!" Some were afraid of losing their prestige, saying, "Anyway, it's low, everyone is low, it doesn't matter, it's the government's horse for the government to ride." In order to solve this problem, the leadership first repeatedly explained to the staff members that violating the principle of mutual benefit would affect the unity of poor and middle peasants, and used the facts of emaciated and dead draft cattle and farmers selling cattle one after another to illustrate the harm of doing so to the development of production. After clearing the minds of the grassroots staff, propaganda on the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy was further launched among the broad masses. The cooperative members generally agreed with correcting the deviation of pricing draft cattle too low. Through democratic consultation, the work of adjusting cattle prices was fully launched according to the normal and reasonable prices in the local area this year. At the same time, the repayment period for cattle money was also shortened, and it was stipulated that a certain amount of interest should be paid. After this adjustment, the feeding and management of draft cattle in the cooperatives were greatly improved. For example, Tang Xingtai, a middle peasant in Hengshan Township, had no intention of feeding the cattle because the price of the cattle was too low after joining the cooperative, and as a result, the fat cattle were fed into "dry cowhides." After adjusting the price of the cattle, he quickly fed the "Grade C cattle" into "Grade A cattle." In the past, many people in Guihua Township did not give cattle medicine (for disease prevention) or feed, but now they all give medicine and add feed to strengthen the protection of draft cattle. The phenomenon of selling cattle has also stopped. Originally, eight farmers in Zitong Township wanted to sell cattle, but now they are not selling them. Liu Caida, a member of the first village mutual aid team, saw that the price of cattle for joining the cooperative was too low, and asked to sell the cattle three times; after the cooperative adjusted the price of the cattle, he said: "I must feed the cattle well, so that I can get a good price for joining the cooperative in the future." When adjusting the price of cattle, many cooperatives improved the system of feeding and using draft cattle. Those who raise draft cattle well should be rewarded after evaluation. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guihua District divided the draft cattle into different grades according to their strength, and stipulated the work quota for each head of cattle, overcoming the phenomenon of using "ruthless cattle."

Raising pigs is the most important sideline occupation of farmers in Sichuan, and pig manure is the main source of natural fertilizer for farmers. However, since the great development of agricultural cooperatives in Suining County, except for a few cooperatives where the number of pigs has increased slightly, the total number of pigs owned by the cooperatives and individuals has decreased in most production cooperatives. Although the Fujiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longping Township raised 33 more public pigs, the number of pigs owned by the members personally decreased from 313 to 201. The New Bridge Seventh Agricultural Production Cooperative originally had 54 pigs, and by the end of February this year, it had decreased by 15. Generally, the number of pigs in the cooperatives has decreased by about 15%. The reason for the decrease in the number of pigs is mainly that many cooperatives did not take care of the interests of pig farmers, and the price of pig manure used by the members for the cooperative was evaluated too low (for example, in Guihua District, the market price of two cents for pig manure was only evaluated at one cent). Moreover, they did not pay attention to solving the problem of feed for members to raise pigs personally. The masses felt that raising pigs was unprofitable, and even if there was feed, they sold the pigs. When rectifying the agricultural production cooperatives, the cooperatives uniformly solved the problem of feed for members to raise pigs privately, and also reasonably adjusted the price of manure. As a result, the enthusiasm of the members for raising pigs has increased. In the more than 600 cooperatives in the county, the number of pigs raised privately by the members has increased by 3,379. After the New Bridge Seventh Cooperative adjusted the price of manure, the number of pigs increased from more than 30 to more than 50 in less than a month. Zhong Fubin, a middle peasant in the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xinhua Township, sold four of his pigs some time ago, leaving only one; after the price of manure was increased, he added four more fat pig racks. The members happily said: Now we don't have to worry about the lack of fertilizer, and increased production is guaranteed! Many cadres in the past were anxious about the decrease in the number of pigs and tried various methods to restrict the masses from selling pigs, but to no avail. Now they all realize the root cause of the problem and understand the importance of implementing the mutually beneficial policy.

During the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives, the problem of production investment of each cooperative was also solved. In the past, cadres lacked experience in solving this problem, and many shortcomings were produced in the work. Many cooperatives mixed various investments together indiscriminately, calculated a "general account" in general, and apportioned them to each member household according to output or acreage. As a result of calculating and apportioning various investments at one time in five cooperatives in Guangsheng Township, each mu had to invest 4.70 to 5 yuan. Wu Chengzhu, a middle peasant in Anju Second Cooperative, had to invest more than 121 yuan at one time. The various investments of the Xingfu Branch of Xining Second Village totaled more than 2,300 yuan, which is estimated to account for more than 43% of the total annual income. The huge investment increased the cost of production, causing many members to panic. Some cooperatives simply relied on state loans to solve the investment problem, and did not actively mobilize members to invest. Some cooperatives did not conduct propaganda and mobilization, but adopted the method of secretly finding out the bottom line, and asked whoever had money to invest, infringing on the interests of some middle peasants. When rectifying the agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to repeatedly publicizing the benefits of members' investment to the cooperative and to themselves, and publicizing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit to improve the enthusiasm of members for investment, it was also stipulated the method of repaying the principal and interest of various investments. The method of paying off at one time was changed to paying in installments according to the specific situation. Reduce cash investment and encourage more investment in kind and natural fertilizer. After this regulation, the enthusiasm of the members for investment increased. In the Thirteenth Cooperative of Guihua Township, the members paid more than 80% of the cash investment in a few days. Nine cooperatives also received an additional 570 yuan of free investment.

In the past, the land output evaluation of the cooperatives in Suining County was very low, and the evaluation of the normal annual output of some cooperatives was less than 60% of the actual output. In this way, the land remuneration was suppressed. For example, the output evaluated by the Twenty-fourth Cooperative of Guihua was only 58% of the actual output; according to the estimated annual distribution results, the land profit only accounted for 20% of the actual output; four of the five middle peasant households in the cooperative would reduce their income. When rectifying the agricultural production cooperatives, after democratic discussions among the members, the deviation of setting the output too low was corrected, and the output was re-evaluated. In this way, according to the increased production plan, it can be achieved that all households in the cooperative increase production, and the middle peasants and poor peasants all agree.

After these specific problems were solved, the agricultural production cooperatives in the county were further consolidated, and the production enthusiasm of the peasants inside and outside the cooperatives was greatly improved. In the spring plowing production, the work of fighting drought and protecting water, building water conservancy projects, rushing to plant early-maturing crops, and improving farming techniques was fully launched, laying the foundation for running agricultural production cooperatives well and completing the increased production plan.

　　遂宁县农业合作社怎样贯彻互利政策
　　中共遂宁地委农村工作部长　吉杰
    四川省遂宁县去年秋季新建立的六百多个农业生产合作社，在耕畜折价、生产投资和土地评产等问题上，没有认真贯彻互利政策，因之社内存在很多问题，影响了社员的生产情绪。为了巩固这批新建的社，在今年春耕期间，中共遂宁县委大力进行了整顿社的工作。经过整顿，加强了贫农中农的团结，春耕生产工作有了比较好的成绩。
    去年建社中，许多社过早地实行了耕牛折价归社的办法；一般耕牛折价都比市价低五元至十元左右，而且付款期过长。这样一来，许多牛主不愿好好饲养耕牛了（耕牛折价归社后仍由牛主负责饲养）。有的牛主说：“牛死了我只一份，看你社里有啥办法！”遂宁横山乡折价入社的二十二头牛，有十五头都瘦了，有四头死了。有些互助组员和个体农民，怕将来入社牛价订得低不合算，也把牛卖了。莲花乡二村中农杨连成，怕自己将来入社吃亏，把牛卖了以后才要求入社。在整顿农业生产合作社的时候，领导方面提出，应当纠正耕牛作价不合理的做法。最初，许多工作人员的思想有抵触。有的怕麻烦，说：“牵了藤藤瓜瓜动，已经评过了，何必纠正找麻烦？”有的说：“人家已经睡着了，我们要把人家惊醒来！”有的怕丧失自己的威信，说：“反正低了，大家都低，没来头，官家马儿官家骑。”为了解决这个问题，领导方面首先向工作人员反复说明了违背互利原则会影响贫农和中农的团结，用耕牛瘦弱死亡和农民纷纷出卖耕牛的事实说明这样做对于发展生产的害处。打通了基层工作人员的思想以后，就在广大群众中进一步展开了自愿互利政策的宣传。社员群众对于纠正耕牛作价过低的偏向都很赞成，通过民主协商，按当地今年正常合理的价格，全面展开了调整牛价的工作，同时把牛款付还期限也缩短了，并且规定要付给一定的利息。经过这样调整，各社的耕牛饲养管理工作大大改进了。如横山乡中农唐兴太入社后，因为牛价折低了，没心思喂牛，结果大肥牛喂成了“干牛皮”。调整牛价以后，他很快就把“丙级牛”喂成了“甲级牛”。桂花乡过去很多人不给牛灌药（防病）、喂料，现在都灌药、加料，加强了耕牛保护工作。卖牛的现象也停止了。梓潼乡原来有八户农民要卖牛，现在都不卖了。第一村互助组员刘才达，看见入社牛价折得太低，三次要求卖牛；社内调整了牛价以后，他说：“我一定要把牛喂好，将来入社可以折个好价钱。”在调整牛价时，许多社改进了耕牛的饲养和使用的制度。对于耕牛养得好的，要经过评比给以奖励。桂花区东方红农业生产合作社，按照耕牛的牛力强弱，分出不同等级，规定出各头牛的耕作定量，克服了使“狠心牛”的现象。
    养猪是四川农民最主要的一种副业，猪粪又是农民自然肥料的主要来源。但是，遂宁县自农业社大发展以来，除少数社猪只略有增加以外，大部分生产合作社公有和私有的猪只的总数减少了。龙坪乡涪江农业生产合作社虽然多养了三十三只公有的猪，但社员个人的猪却由三百一十三只减少到二百零一只。新桥第七农业生产合作社原有五十四只猪，到今年二月底减少了十五只。一般社猪只都减少了百分之十五左右。猪只减少的原因，主要是许多社没有照顾养猪户的利益，把社员给社里用的猪肥价格评的太低（如桂花区把市价二角的猪肥只评了一角多），而且没有注意解决社员个人喂猪的饲料问题。群众感到喂猪没利，即使有饲料的，也把猪卖了。在整顿农业生产合作社的时候，各社统一解决了社员私人喂猪的饲料问题，还合理调整了粪价。这样一来，社员养猪的积极性提高了。全县六百多个社，只是社员私人喂养的猪就增加了三千三百七十九只。新桥第七社调整粪价以后，不到一个月猪就由三十多只增加到五十多只。新华乡第二农业生产合作社中农钟富宾，前些时把四只猪卖的只剩下一只了；粪价提高以后，他又增加了四只肥架子猪。社员们高兴地说：这下不愁缺肥料了，增产有保证了！许多干部过去看到猪只减少，急得没办法，用各种办法限制群众卖猪，却无济于事。现在他们都认识发生问题的根源了，也了解了贯彻互利政策的重要。
    在整顿农业生产合作社当中，还解决了各个社的生产投资问题。过去干部对于解决这个问题特别缺乏经验，工作当中产生了不少缺点。不少社把各种投资不加区别地混在一起，笼统地算个“大账”，一律按产量或地亩摊派给每户社员。广胜乡五个社把各种投资一次计算分摊的结果，每亩要投四元七角到五元。安居第二社中农吴成祖，一次就要投资一百二十一元多。西宁二村幸福分社各种投资共二千三百多元，估计占全年总收入百分之四十三还多。庞大的投资加大了生产成本，引起许多社员惶惶不安。有些社则单纯依赖国家贷款解决投资问题，不积极发动社员投资。有些社不进行宣传动员，而采取暗中摸底的办法，看到谁有钱就叫谁投，侵犯了某些中农的利益。整顿农业生产合作社的时候，除针对社员思想情况反复宣传社员投资对社和对自己的好处，宣传自愿互利原则，提高社员投资积极性以外，还规定了各种投资的还本付息办法。把一次缴清的办法，改变为按照具体情况分期分季缴纳。减少现金投资，鼓励多投实物和自然肥料。这样规定以后，社员投资积极性提高了。桂花乡十三社，没有几天，社员就缴纳了百分之八十以上的现金投资。有九个社还收到五百七十元额外的自由投资。
    过去，遂宁县各社土地产量评定的都很低，有的社评定的常年应产量不到实产的百分之六十。这样，就压低了土地报酬。例如，桂花二十四社评定的产量只及实产量的百分之五十八；预计全年分配结果，土地分益仅占实产量的百分之二十；全社五户中农，有四户要减少收入。在整顿农业生产合作社的时候，经过社员民主讨论，纠正了订产偏低的偏向，重新改评了产量。这样，按照增产计划计算，可以做到全社户户增产，中农和贫农都很同意。
    这几个具体问题解决了以后，全县的农业生产合作社都进一步巩固了，社内社外农民的生产情绪都大大提高了。在春耕生产中，全面展开了抗旱保水、兴修水利、抢种早熟作物、改良耕作技术的工作，为办好农业生产合作社和完成增产计划打下了基础。
