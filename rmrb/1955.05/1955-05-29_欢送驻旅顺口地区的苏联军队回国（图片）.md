Welcoming the Return Home of Soviet Troops Stationed in the Lushunkou Area

    In accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Lushunkou of February 14, 1950, and the Joint Communiqué of October 12, 1954, on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the jointly used Chinese naval base of Lushunkou and the transfer of the base to the complete control of the People's Republic of China, the two sides signed the final protocol on May 24, 1955, regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the jointly used Lushunkou naval base and the gratuitous transfer of equipment in the area to our country. Now, all Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area have completed their withdrawal from the Lushunkou area, and our government has completely taken over the Lushunkou naval base and the equipment in this area.

    More than 110,000 people from all walks of life in the Lushun-Dalian Municipality held a rally in Stalin Square on May 8 to welcome the Soviet troops who have made great contributions to safeguarding our country's security, safeguarding the Far East, and world peace, and who are about to return home.
