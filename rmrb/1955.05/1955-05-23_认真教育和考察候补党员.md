　　In recent years, with the gradual development of Party building work and the large increase in probationary Party members, many provincial and municipal Party committees have held meetings specifically to study the management of probationary Party members, striving to improve the education and examination work for probationary Party members. Many grassroots Party organizations, such as Party committees of industrial and mining enterprises, and county and district Party committees in rural areas, have adopted specific measures such as holding collective training for probationary Party members or organizing probationary Party member study groups. This has enabled the vast ranks of probationary Party members to truly become an excellent reserve force that constantly replenishes the Party organization with new strength. Thousands upon thousands of probationary Party members who have undergone Party education and examination are constantly being approved to become full Party members, ensuring the continuous consolidation and development of the Party organization.

　　However, this by no means indicates that we have done a good job in the work of probationary Party members. In fact, the phenomenon of neglecting the education and examination of probationary Party members is still quite serious in some Party organizations today. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of directly affiliated organs of the CPC, not long ago, conducted an inspection of the situation of probationary Party members in its affiliated branches and found that 49 out of 241 probationary Party members who should have been transferred to full membership could not be transferred on schedule. Some of these had minor shortcomings, but as long as education was strengthened during the probationary period, these shortcomings could be corrected and the transfer could be made on time. For example, a probationary Party member of the Shanxi Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China had the main shortcoming of not being able to carry out criticism and self-criticism when he joined the Party. However, during the probationary period, the branch did not educate him. Until the end of the probationary period, he still had his probationary period extended by half a year because this shortcoming had not been overcome. There were also some probationary Party members who were relatively active after joining the Party, but gradually became lax due to the branch's neglect of their education. Not only could they not continue to correct their previous shortcomings, but they also developed somewhat. Among the aforementioned 49 people who could not be transferred on schedule, 15 were because they developed arrogance and complacency after joining the Party and became detached from the masses. The same situation also exists in factory and rural Party organizations. Liang Sen and Liang Liangxi, probationary Party members of the Longchao Township Party Branch in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, did not perform well in their work after joining the Party and were unwilling to participate in organizational life. The Party branch did not criticize or educate them, so that their probationary period was prolonged for more than five years without principle, and they were neither transferred to full membership nor were their probationary Party member qualifications revoked.

　　These facts show that some people in some Party organizations still lack a comprehensive understanding of Party building work and do not regard educating and examining probationary Party members as an important part of Party building work. On the contrary, they believe that the task of Party building is completed once new Party members are admitted. Some say: "Probationary Party members have already undergone Party examination and education before joining the Party, so there is no need to conduct education and examination during the probationary period." Others say: "As long as they participate in Party meetings and Party organizational life, they will improve without education." These statements are obviously very wrong. Admitting new Party members and educating and examining new Party members is an inseparable task. That is to say, turning advanced elements from the masses into probationary Party members is only the first step in completing Party building work, while turning probationary Party members into full Party members requires the second step of work, that is, continuing to educate and examine probationary Party members. Because although probationary Party members already possess the basic political consciousness of a Party member, and most of them can actively work for the Party after joining the Party, they are, after all, newly joined the Party, and the education they received before joining the Party was only preliminary. They have not actually participated in Party organizational life, nor have they been trained within the Party; therefore, their ideological level is still very low, they still lack Party knowledge and work experience, and even harbor some serious shortcomings. Therefore, to make a probationary Party member reach the standard of a full Party member, not only must they undergo long-term ideological education and examination work before joining the Party, but more importantly, after joining the Party, especially during the probationary period, they must be given strict training. Article 7 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates: "The role of the probationary period for probationary members is to enable the probationary person to receive preliminary Party education and to ensure that the Party organization examines the probationary person's political qualities in their work." This means that the probationary period is a serious test for probationary Party members and also an important stage for probationary Party members to receive Party education and training. During the probationary period, the Party organization must, on the one hand, educate probationary Party members to understand the Party program, Party constitution, Party line and tasks, and various specific Party policies, and help them improve their Marxism-Leninism level; on the other hand, it must examine the political qualities of probationary Party members and whether they are loyal to the Party's cause through various methods, and whether they meet the standards of Party members, so as to ensure the quality of Party members and the purity of the Party organization. This is an indispensable and important step in consolidating the Party organization. To this end, Party organizations at all levels, especially grassroots Party organizations, must include the education and examination of probationary Party members in the Party's work agenda, formulate specific and feasible plans based on the different situations and characteristics of factories, mines, rural areas, organs, schools, etc., assign special personnel to be responsible, and conduct them in a planned, organized, and led manner.

　　An effective method of educating and examining probationary Party members is to combine Party political education with practical work. Probationary Party members are advanced elements absorbed from mass struggles and production work. Their political qualities, level of awareness, policy level, and work ability are concentratedly manifested in the current production, work, and study. Therefore, the education and examination of probationary Party members must not be carried out in isolation from mass struggles and current various tasks. For example, in the rural unified purchase and sale of grain work, in the factory's wage assessment or production competition and other work, these are times when the interests of the Party and individual interests are prone to conflict, and therefore also the best opportunity to test each probationary Party member. The Party organization should assign them specific work tasks consciously and purposefully based on the different situations of each probationary Party member, and test and train them in actual work. Experience has proved that only in this way can we better understand their ideological and work situations, examine their political qualities and work attitudes, so as to target their main weaknesses, educate them practically, cultivate their qualities, improve their working methods, teach them to follow the mass line, give play to their initiative and creativity, and promote the victorious completion of current production work.

　　Educating and examining probationary Party members is the task of the entire Party organization and should not be seen as merely the responsibility of the branch committee and a few organizers. Because every Party member is a member of the Party organization, they should all care about the consolidation and development of the Party organization. Actively carrying out the work of educating and examining probationary Party members is a concrete manifestation of caring about the Party organization. In the future, with the further development of Party building work, a large number of advanced elements of the masses will continue to be absorbed into the Party. The ideological consciousness, political qualities, and work attitudes of these probationary Party members will be manifested at any time and anywhere in daily work and life, and therefore it is necessary to educate and examine them at any time and anywhere. This requires giving play to the role of the entire Party organization, mobilizing all Party members, dividing responsibilities, and conducting regular education and examination of probationary Party members in a planned, organized, and led manner. It should be particularly pointed out here that the introducers of Party members bear a very important responsibility in the examination and education of probationary Party members. Usually, some people think that after the introduced person joins the Party, the introducer's task is also completed, saying that "the master leads the way, the cultivation is up to the individual," which is incorrect and actually an excuse for shirking responsibility. According to the Party Constitution, every person who joins the Party must have two full Party members as introducers. These introducers must not only be responsible for educating and examining the introduced person before they join the Party, but even after they join the Party, especially during the probationary period, the introducer must still be responsible for educating and examining them and helping them to be transferred to full membership in a timely manner. This is an unshirkable responsibility of every introducer.

　　The probationary period is a serious test for probationary Party members. Every probationary Party member should firmly remember that raising themselves to the level of a full Party member mainly depends on their own efforts and learning. They should regularly check their thoughts and work according to the standards of Party members, overcome their shortcomings, and constantly improve their level of awareness and revolutionary qualities. At the same time, they must actively expose their thoughts to the Party, explain all past problems that have not been explained or explained unclearly, and help the Party to further examine their history, qualities, and style of work. Only in this way can they receive better training during the probationary period and become a strong communist fighter.

　　Only by doing a good job in the education and examination of probationary Party members can the work of transferring probationary Party members to full membership be done well. The situation of the transfer of probationary Party members to full membership is not only a review of the work of admitting Party members, but also a review of the work of educating and examining probationary Party members, which is of great significance for maintaining the quality and purity of the Party. Therefore, the Party organization must treat this work seriously and cautiously. Here, we must both oppose the phenomenon of carelessness that does not adhere to the standards of Party members and does not conduct thorough research, and "transfers to full membership as usual"; at the same time, we must also oppose the phenomenon of not proceeding from reality and making some excessive and strict demands on probationary Party members that exceed the standards of Party members. These must be prevented and corrected.

### 认真教育和考察候补党员

　　认真教育和考察候补党员
    近几年来，在建党工作逐步开展、候补党员大量增加的情况下，许多省、市委都曾召开会议专门研究过对候补党员的管理问题，努力改进对候补党员的教育和考察工作，许多基层党组织，如工矿企业党委，农村县区党委，都采取了集训候补党员或组织候补党员学习小组等具体措施。这就使广大的候补党员的队伍，真正成为经常以新生力量补充党组织的优秀的后备军，成千成万的经过党的教育和考察的候补党员，经常不断地被批准转为正式党员，保证了党组织不断地巩固和发展。
    但是，这绝不能说，我们对候补党员的工作已经作得很好了。事实上，今天在某些党组织中，忽视对候补党员进行教育和考察工作的现象还相当严重。中共山西省直属机关委员会，不久以前曾对所属各支部中的候补党员情况进行了检查，发现在应转正的二百四十一名候补党员中有四十九人不能按期转正。其中有些是稍有缺点，但只要在候补期中加强教育，就可以改正缺点、按时转正的。如中国人民保险公司山西省分公司的一个候补党员，入党时的主要缺点是不能开展批评和自我批评，但在候补期中，支部没有对他进行教育，一直到候补期满了，还是因为这个缺点没有克服而延长了候补期半年。也有些入党后本来比较积极的候补党员，由于支部忽视了对他们的教育，而逐渐松懈下来，对以往的缺点不但不能继续改正，反而有所发展。在上述不能按期转正的四十九人中，有十五人就是因为入党后滋长了骄傲自满情绪，而脱离了群众。同样的情况也存在于工厂和农村党组织中。广东省湛江市龙潮乡党支部的候补党员梁森和梁良西，入党后工作表现不很好，不愿过组织生活，党支部对他们也不进行批评教育，以致候补期无原则地被拖长了五年多，没有转正，也没有取消候补党员资格。
    这些事实说明，某些党组织中的人员，对建党工作还缺乏全面的认识，没有把教育和考察候补党员看成是建党工作的一个重要部分，反而认为接收了新党员入党，就完成了建党的任务。有的说：“候补党员在入党前已经经过了党的考察和教育，在候补期中就没有再进行教育和考察的必要了。”也有的说：“他们只要参加党的会议，过党的组织生活，不用教育，也会提高的。”这些说法显然是非常错误的。接收新党员入党和对新党员进行教育和考察是一件不可分割的工作，也就是说，把群众中的先进分子变为候补党员，这只是完成了建党工作的第一步，而把候补党员变为正式党员，还必须作好第二步的工作，即继续对候补党员进行教育和考察。因为候补党员虽然已经具备了作为党员的基本的政治觉悟，入党后大都能积极为党工作，但他们毕竟还是刚刚入党，他们在入党前所受的教育还是初步的，他们没有实际参加过党的组织生活，没有受过党内的锻炼；因而，他们的思想水平还很低，还缺乏党的知识和工作经验，甚至还潜伏着某些严重的缺点。所以要使一个候补党员达到一个正式党员的标准，不仅要在入党前对他们进行长期的思想教育工作和考察工作，而更重要的是在入党以后，首先是在候补期间，要给以严格的锻炼。中国共产党党章第七条规定：“候补党员候补期的作用，是使候补人接受初步的党的教育，并在工作中保证党的组织考察候补人的政治品质。”这就是说，候补期对候补党员是严重的考验，也是候补党员受到党的教育和锻炼的重要阶段。在候补期中，党组织一方面要教育候补党员认识党纲、党章、党的路线和任务以及党的各项具体政策，帮助他们提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平；一方面要通过各种方式去考察候补党员的政治品质和他们对党的事业是否忠诚，是否合乎党员的标准，以保证党员的质量和党组织的纯洁性。这是巩固党的组织所不可缺少的一个重要步骤。为此，各级党组织尤其是基层党组织，必须把对候补党员的教育和考察工作列入党的工作日程之中，根据工厂、矿山、农村、机关、学校等不同的情况和特点，订出具体可行的计划，指定专人负责，有领导有计划地去进行。
    教育和考察候补党员的有效方法，是把党的政治教育和实际工作结合起来去进行。候补党员是从群众斗争和生产工作中吸收来的先进分子，他们的政治品质、觉悟程度、政策水平、工作能力，集中地表现在当前的生产、工作和学习中，因此，对候补党员的教育和考察绝不能脱离开群众斗争和当前各种工作孤立地去进行。比如，在农村的粮食统购统销工作中，在工厂的评定工资或生产竞赛等工作中，这都是党的利益和个人利益容易发生矛盾的时候，因而也是考验每个候补党员最好的时机。党组织应当根据每个候补党员的不同情况，有意识地有目的地分配给他们以具体的工作任务，到实际工作中去考验和锻炼他们。经验证明：只有这样，才能更好地了解他们的思想情况和工作情况，考察他们的政治品质和工作态度，从而才能针对其主要弱点，切合实际地进行教育，培养他们的品质，改进他们的工作方法，教会他们走群众路线，发挥他们的主动性和创造性，推动当前生产工作的胜利完成。
    教育和考察候补党员，是整个党组织的任务，不应看作仅仅是支部委员会和少数组织员的事情。因为每个党员都是党组织的一分子，都应当关心党组织的巩固和发展。积极地去作教育和考察候补党员的工作便是关心党组织的一种具体表现。今后随着建党工作的进一步开展，仍将有大批的群众先进分子被继续不断地吸收到党内来，这些候补党员的思想意识、政治品质和工作态度，在日常工作和生活中随时随地都会表现出来，因而也就需要随时随地对他们进行教育和考察。这就必须发挥整个党组织的作用，把全体党员动员起来，分工负责，有计划有组织有领导地对候补党员进行经常性的教育和考察。这里特别要指出，党员的入党介绍人，在对候补党员的考察和教育工作中负有很重大的责任。通常有人认为在被介绍人入党之后，介绍人的任务也跟着完结了，说什么“师傅领进门，修炼在个人”，这是不正确的，实际上是一种推卸责任的借口。按照党章规定，每一个入党的，都要有两个正式党员作介绍人。这些介绍人不但要在被介绍人入党之前负责对他进行教育和考察，就是他入党之后，首先在候补期中，介绍人仍要负责对他进行教育和考察，帮助他及时转正。这是每一个介绍人义不容辞的责任。
    候补期对候补党员是一个严重的考验。每一个候补党员都应当牢牢记住，把自己提高到正式党员的水平，主要靠自己的努力和学习，应当经常地按照党员标准检查自己的思想和工作，克服自己的缺点，不断地提高自己的觉悟程度和革命品质。同时，还要主动地向党暴露自己的思想，交代一切过去没有交代或是交代不清的问题，帮助党对自己的历史、品质和作风作进一步的考察。只有这样，才能在候补期间受到更好的锻炼，使自己成为一个坚强的共产主义战士。
    做好了教育和考察候补党员的工作，候补党员的转正工作也才能做好。候补党员转正的情形怎样，不仅是对接收党员工作的一次检查，同时也是对候补党员的教育考察工作的一次检查，这对保持党的质量和纯洁性有着非常重大的意义。因此，党组织必须严肃、慎重地对待这一工作。在这里既要反对那种不坚持党员标准，不经过缜密研究，一律“照例转正”的草率从事的现象；同时也要反对那种不从实际出发，对候补党员提出一些过高、过严、超出党员标准的要求。这都是必须注意防止和纠正的。
