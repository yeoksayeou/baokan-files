　　The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC Holds Plenary Session

The first plenary session of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Municipal Committee was held from May 12th to 15th. Two hundred and fifty members attended the meeting. The meeting unanimously expressed its determination to mobilize the strength of all strata of the people to change the irrational conditions of the old Shanghai, such as its malformed development and bloated size, and to strive to build Shanghai into an advanced socialist city.

At the meeting, Hu Juewen, the former vice-chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, made a report on the work of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee over the past five years. Chen Pixian, Second Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, made a political report.

After analyzing the current international situation, Chen Pixian pointed out that Shanghai has made many contributions in the period of national economic recovery and the first two years of the first five-year plan since liberation, and will continue to play its role in the future. However, the malformed development and bloated phenomenon left over from old Shanghai have not been completely changed, and it cannot be said that Shanghai is a city that meets socialist requirements. The future task of transforming Shanghai is to actively and step by step make reasonable adjustments and reforms to the existing industry and commerce, in accordance with the requirements of socialist industrialization, the state's plan for the rational distribution of production undertakings, and the principle of national defense security, in the process of implementing the state's general task during the transition period and carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and gradually eliminate the bloated situation. Chen Pixian said: We must actively support national construction with manpower, materials, and financial resources, strive to increase production and practice economy, streamline institutions, reduce levels, improve work efficiency, and we must also increase our vigilance a hundredfold, thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and remove all obstacles on the road to advancement.

In his report, Chen Pixian emphasized that Shanghai is located on the front line of national defense and is a city with a relatively concentrated industry and commerce, and it bears a major responsibility in supporting the liberation of Taiwan and supporting the cause of national socialist construction. We must strengthen unity, give play to collective wisdom, and gradually transform Shanghai into an advanced socialist city.

The members fully discussed Chen Pixian's political report. At the conference, fifty-seven members spoke, unanimously endorsing the guiding principle of transforming Shanghai and putting forward many positive suggestions. Many members believed that in the work of transforming Shanghai, it is necessary to pool the wisdom of the masses, give play to the spirit of consultation, strengthen unity, and strictly guard against sabotage by enemies at home and abroad.

At the end of the meeting, Ke Qingshi was elected as the chairman of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Municipal Committee by secret ballot, and Zhao Jiping, Sheng Peihua, Hu Juewen, Jin Zhonghua, Liu Shuzhou, Shen Zhiyuan, and Li Zhaohuan were elected as vice-chairmen. In addition, seventy-two people were elected as standing committee members.

　　政协上海市委员会举行全体会议
    中国人民政治协商会议上海市第一届委员会第一次全体会议，在五月十二日到十五日举行。出席会议的有二百五十位委员。会上一致表示要动员各阶层人民的力量，为改变旧上海遗留下来的畸形发展、臃肿庞大等不合理状况，把上海市建设成一个先进的社会主义城市而努力。
    会上前上海市协商委员会副主席胡厥文作了关于上海市协商委员会五年来工作的报告。中共上海市委员会第二书记陈丕显作了政治报告。
    陈丕显在分析了当前的国际形势以后指出：解放五年来，上海在国家经济恢复时期和第一个五年计划头两年的工作中，是有许多贡献的，今后仍将不断发挥它的作用。但是，旧上海遗留下来的畸形发展和臃肿庞大的现象还没有彻底改变，现在还不能说上海已是一个合乎社会主义要求的城市。今后改造上海的工作，是要在贯彻国家过渡时期的总任务、对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的过程中，根据社会主义工业化的要求、国家合理分布生产事业的计划和国防安全的原则，积极地有步骤地对现有工商业进行合理的调整和改革，逐步地消灭臃肿状况。陈丕显说：我们必须积极以人力、物力、财力支援全国建设，努力增产节约，紧缩机关，减少层次，提高工作效率，还要百倍提高警惕，彻底肃清反革命分子，扫除一切前进道路上的障碍。
    陈丕显在报告中强调指出，上海地处国防前线，又是一个工商业比较集中的城市，在支援解放台湾和支援国家社会主义建设事业中，担负着重大的责任。我们必须加强团结，发挥集体智慧，把上海逐步改造成为社会主义的先进城市。
    委员们对陈丕显的这个政治报告进行了充分的讨论。在大会上有五十七位委员发言，他们一致拥护改造上海的工作方针，并提出了许多积极的建议。许多委员认为，在改造上海的工作中，必须群策群力，发挥协商精神，加强团结，严防国内外敌人破坏。
    会议最后以无记名投票方式选出柯庆施为中国人民政治协商会议上海市第一届委员会主席，赵季平、盛丕华、胡厥文、金仲华、刘述周、沈志远、黎照寰为副主席，另外选出七十二人为常务委员。
