　  Leibo County, a concentrated area of ​​Yi people in the Liangshan Mountains, deep in the mountains and ridges on the border of Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan, is building its first hydroelectric power station. The earth and stone works of the hydropower station have already started, and it is planned to be completed this year. This power station will supply electricity for lighting, rice milling, medical care, and factory and mine construction.
    The surveying team organized by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry twice crossed the Wuzhi Mountain and the Fen Shuiling, which are more than 2,000 meters above sea level, to Leibo to help the Yi people build this hydroelectric power station. They followed the Jinsha River, where the Red Army once marched, and painstakingly completed the preliminary survey and resurvey, and then produced the technical design and construction design of the hydroelectric power station. Now, factories in Chongqing and Shanghai are rushing to manufacture machinery and equipment for this hydroelectric power station.

　  雷波县兴建水力发电站
    川、康、滇边深山丛岭中的凉山彝族聚居区雷波县，正在修建第一座水力发电站。目前水电站的土石方工程已经动工，计划在本年内完工。这个发电站将供应照明、碾米、医疗和厂矿修建等用电。
    四川省工业厅组织的勘测队，曾两次翻过海拔两千多公尺的五指山、分水岭，来到雷波，帮助彝族人民修建这座水电站。他们沿着红军当年走过的金沙江，艰辛地完成初测和复测以后，又做出了水电站的技术设计和施工设计。现在，重庆和上海等地的工厂正在为这座水电站赶制机器设备。
