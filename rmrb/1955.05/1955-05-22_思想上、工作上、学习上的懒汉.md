Slackers in Thought, Work, and Study

To the Editor:

　　Bai Shuitian, the Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, was originally the County Head of Xishui County, Hubei Province. It is said that he was very successful in his work in Xishui County. When he was first transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, everyone had high hopes for him, but the facts of the past year have greatly disappointed his comrades.

　　As soon as Bai Shuitian arrived at the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, he ordered the public to subscribe to seventeen newspapers and nine magazines for his personal use; in addition, all documents, instructions, and reports had to be copied for him. In reality, he rarely looked at these things himself, and had two full-time cadres to keep them for him. Often, in the late hours of the night, these two cadres would take turns reading documents and newspapers to him, while he lay down and closed his eyes to rest. When the reader saw that he was asleep, they would read aloud; when he woke up, they would read softly. Sometimes he would be fast asleep and they would stop reading, but when he woke up, he would blame the cadre, saying: “Why aren’t you reading!” Although he was too lazy to read the newspapers, when he went out to work, he would have the department forward these seventeen newspapers everywhere he went; sometimes he would even make long-distance phone calls back to have the cadres read the newspapers to him over the phone, pretending to be eager to learn. He was also very lazy in his work, almost all the instructions, work summaries, and speaking outlines for his reports at meetings were written by his subordinates; sometimes he didn't even explain his intentions clearly, but just wanted others to write and revise, revise and rewrite, leaving the cadres at a loss. Every time he held a meeting to deploy work, there were always more than a dozen tasks, and almost all of them were "extremely" important, some requiring reports every three days, others every five days, causing the cadres to rush to write them overnight. But after others had prepared the materials, he was too lazy to look at them; some cadres followed his instructions to go to the countryside to understand the work, but after they came back, he didn't ask about it at all.

　　The phenomenon of waste in the Department of Agriculture and Forestry was already very serious, but after Bai Shuitian came, it became even more developed. According to his opinion, general documents, instructions, and even newspaper editorials had to be sent to the special commissioner's offices or counties by telegram or telephone. In August 1954, an editorial in the Hubei Daily, as long as 2,500 characters, was telegraphed to the Xiangyang Special Commissioner's Office, where it took two people a day and a half to translate; before the full text could be translated, the Hubei Daily arrived. This is how he squandered state property so extravagantly!

　　Bai Shuitian was very lazy in his work and study, but he was very active in calculating his living treatment. Bai Shuitian was originally a 14th-grade cadre, and last year the Party Group of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry studied and proposed to promote him to the 12th grade, but the Provincial Party Committee only approved him as the 13th grade. He was very dissatisfied with this matter and told the head of the personnel section: "Don't announce my rank for the time being, I still want to talk to the Provincial Party Committee..." He did not have any objections until the Provincial Party Committee promoted him to the 12th grade. He often asked the public to take care of the lives of his relatives, children, and wife, and received a total of 477 yuan in subsidies from August 1954 to March of this year. Because of his subsidies, the head of the personnel section often had to go to the personnel department to negotiate, which was very difficult for the head of the personnel section.

　　Recently, the cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry have sharply criticized Bai Shuitian's individualistic ideology and work style. But Bai Shuitian still believes that his erroneous behavior of squandering state property, and his laziness in work and study, were for the sake of work; that it is "something that cannot be changed in ten thousand years." This attitude of persisting in error will bring even greater losses to the work. The relevant Party organization should correct Bai Shuitian's mistakes.

### 思想上、工作上、学习上的懒汉

　　思想上、工作上、学习上的懒汉编辑同志：
    湖北省农林厅副厅长白水田，原来是湖北省浠水县的县长。据说他在浠水县工作很有成绩。开始调到农林厅来的时候，大家对他抱着很大的希望，但是一年来的事实，却使同志们对他十分失望。
    白水田一到农林厅，就要公家给他个人订了十七份报纸、九份杂志；另外不论什么文件、指示、报告都得抄一份给他。实际上这些东西他自己很少看，由两个专职干部替他保管着。往往在深夜的时候，让这两个干部轮流给他读文件和报纸，他自己却躺着闭目养神。读的人看他睡着了，就大声读；他醒了再小声读。有时他睡得很熟就不读了，但他一醒来反而责备干部说：“为什么不读呀！”他虽然懒得看报，但是，当他外出工作的时候，却要厅里把这十七份报纸，随着他的行踪到处转递；有时还要打长途电话回来，让干部在电话里给他读报，伪装得热爱学习的样子。他对工作也很懒惰，几乎是所有的指示、工作总结和他本人在大会上做报告的发言提纲，都叫下面的同志去写；有时连意图也不交代清楚，只是要别人写了再改，改了再写，弄得干部不知所从。他每次开会布置工作，总是十几项任务，而且几乎都是“异常”重要，有的要三天汇报一次，有的要五天汇报一次，弄得干部连夜赶写。等别人把材料弄好了，他又懒得看了；有的干部按照他的指示下乡了解工作，回来以后他却不闻不问。
    农林厅的浪费现象原来就很严重，白水田来了以后，就更加发展起来。根据他的意见，一般的文件、指示，甚至连报纸的社论都要用电报、电话发到各专署或县里。一九五四年八月湖北日报的一篇社论，长达二千五百字，用电报发到襄阳专署后，用了两个人翻译了一天半，没等到全文译出来，湖北日报就到了。他就是这样大手大脚地挥霍国家的财产！
    白水田对于工作、学习表现得十分懒惰，但是对于生活待遇的计较却表现得十分积极。白水田原来是一个十四级的干部，去年经农林厅党组研究拟提为十二级，但省委只批为十三级。他对这件事大为不满，找人事科科长说：关于我的级别，你们暂时不要公布，我还要同省委谈一下……。直到省委提他为十二级才算没有意见。他经常要求公家照顾他的亲属、孩子、爱人的生活，从一九五四年八月到今年三月一共领了补助费四百七十七元。为了他的补助费，经常要人事科长到人事厅去办交涉，人事科长十分为难。
    最近，农林厅的干部对白水田的个人主义的思想作风，提出了尖锐的批评。而白水田对于挥霍国家财产等错误行为，对于工作、学习方面的懒惰表现，却还认为是为了工作；那是“十万年也改不了的”。这种坚持错误的态度将会给工作带来更大的损失。有关党组织应该纠正白水田的错误。
