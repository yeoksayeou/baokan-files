    Worker Safety in Production Must Be Guaranteed
　　Kong Sang
    In early April, the Shanghai Private Da Xin Electrical Equipment Factory experienced three work-related accidents in quick succession. The most serious of these involved Sun Zhemin, a young worker in the coarse wire department. While operating the fast-moving head of a coarse wire drawing machine, his clothing was caught by a wooden spindle because the machine lacked a protective guard. He was crushed by the rolling drum of the machine head and severely injured, dying despite emergency treatment at the hospital. Prior to this, the factory had experienced numerous work-related accidents due to its poor safety equipment. In the first quarter of this year alone, there were four such accidents. Similar situations exist to a significant degree in some private enterprises throughout the country.
    The main reason for the poor labor protection facilities and frequent worker injuries and deaths in many private enterprises is that capitalists prioritize the pursuit of profit and disregard worker safety. The capitalists of the Shanghai Private Da Xin Electrical Equipment Factory were aware of the recurring work-related accidents in the factory but failed to actively improve the equipment over a long period. On the very machine where the fatal accident occurred, a worker's glove had previously been caught and spun halfway around. The wooden spindle on this machine had also snagged a worker in the past. However, the factory owners consistently failed to install protective devices, leading to this significant and fatal accident.
    Such profit-driven behavior by these capitalists, which disregards the lives and safety of workers, violates the government's labor protection laws. This behavior has harmed the public interest and the cause of national economic construction to varying degrees. Neglecting worker safety and failing to actively improve labor protection facilities also reflects the passive attitude of some capitalists towards accepting socialist transformation, believing that "managing production is enough." They use so-called objective difficulties as an excuse not to actively improve workers' working conditions.
    In fact, installing safety equipment generally doesn't cost much money. As long as enterprises are managed with a positive attitude, and labor protection facilities are improved, it will not only benefit the country and the workers but also the capitalists themselves. Capitalists in private enterprises must make good labor protection work a concrete action of loving the country, abiding by the law, and actively accepting socialist transformation, and adopt a correct attitude toward it.
    The Guiyang Municipal People's Court held a public trial for the case of Wu Nanqiu, manager of the private Southwest Rubber Factory, who neglected safety in production, resulting in a serious injury to a worker. The court conducted the trial and rendered a verdict. People's Courts in all localities should seriously deal with capitalists who neglect worker safety and cause serious injuries and deaths in accordance with the law.

    必须保障工人安全生产
　　孔桑
    上海市私营大新电业器材厂在四月上旬接连发生了三次工伤事故。其中最严重的一次，是粗丝部青年工人孙哲民在粗丝车快车头上操作时，因为机器上没有防护罩，衣服被木梢钩住，被车头滚筒轧成重伤，经送医院急救无效而死。在这以前，这个工厂因为安全设备很差，已经发生过不少次工伤事故，仅今年第一季度就发生了四次。类似的现象，在各地有些私营企业中也相当严重地存在着。
    许多私营企业劳动保护设施不好，时常发生工人伤亡事故的主要原因，是资本家只顾追求利润，而不管工人的安全。上海市私营大新电业器材厂资本家对厂里不断发生的工伤事故都是了解的，但是长期不积极改进设备。就在这次发生伤亡事故的机器上，过去已经有一个工人的手套被轧进去甩了半转；这部机器上的木梢子，过去已经钩住过一个工人。但是，工厂资方始终没有去安装防护设备，以致造成了这次重大的伤亡事故。
    这些资本家这种唯利是图、玩忽工人生命安全的行为，已经违反了政府的劳动保护法令。这种行为已在不同程度上危害了公共利益和国家经济建设事业。忽视工人安全，不积极改善劳动保护设施的行为，也反映了部分资本家对接受社会主义改造抱着消极的态度，认为“能对付着生产就行”，借口所谓客观困难，不去积极改善工人的劳动条件。
    事实上，装置安全设备一般都是不要花费多少钱的。只要以积极的态度经营企业，改善了劳动保护设施以后，不仅对国家、对工人有利，对资本家自己也是有好处的。私营企业的资本家必须把作好企业的劳动保护工作，作为爱国守法和积极接受社会主义改造的具体行动之一，采取正确的态度来对待。
    贵阳市人民法院对于私营西南橡胶厂经理吴南秋忽视安全生产，造成工人重伤事故的案件，曾举行公判大会，进行了审理和判决。对于忽视工人安全，造成严重伤亡事故的资本家，各地人民法院都应该依法严肃处理。
