Comrade Editor:

　　For several months now, the news that my mother joined the correct, glorious, and great Chinese Communist Party has continued to inspire and鞭策 me like a tremendous force, compelling me to express my innermost thoughts, to tell you, to tell everyone.

　　My mother, Huang Peide, like millions of other mothers in the old society, was a rural woman with feudal and superstitious ideas, who knew only to work diligently and live life resigned to fate. After suffering from the insults and beatings of the reactionary rulers, she could only weep in secret, lamenting her "bitter fate." To "cultivate for the next life," she even practiced vegetarianism and worshiped Buddha. In late 1949, my hometown (Pengxi County, Sichuan) was liberated, and in early 1950, I voluntarily joined the People's Army. At that time, her level of awareness was still very low, and she tearfully refused to let me go. In my first year in the army, she often hoped that I could return to work locally. Later, the great land reform movement took place in my hometown. Under the education of the Party and the People's Government, my mother began to awaken. She began to realize that her past suffering was not due to "bitter fate," but the result of exploitation by the landlord class. Therefore, she stood up and joined the struggle against feudalism.

　　Since then, she actively participated in various struggles and work in the village, and was successively elected as a women's representative, administrative group leader, and in 1953, she joined the mutual aid team. The village once assessed her for twenty-two substitute workdays, but she resolutely refused, working hard in the mutual aid team, exchanging light work for heavy work, and solving production difficulties. She never demanded special treatment because she was a military dependent. She always took the lead in implementing the government's various policies, such as taking the lead in paying public grain well, actively selling surplus grain, and producing in accordance with the national plan, etc. Therefore, in 1953, she was elected as a model military dependent in the whole village. In 1954, under the Party's patient cultivation and guidance, and after more than a year of studying the Party's general line during the transition period and education on the prospects of socialism, her socialist consciousness greatly improved. On November 28th, she gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In December, she was also rated as a county-level B-grade model military dependent, and received a medal, a certificate of merit, a waterwheel, and a hoe as rewards. In January 1955, their joint group was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, and she was elected as the deputy director. Where did these honors come from? These are all the results of the Party and the People's Government's care and cultivation over the years. Without the Party's education and care, how could a backward rural woman gradually transform into an advanced, conscious vanguard fighter of the working class?

　　My mother's progress not only made me exceptionally happy and sincerely grateful to the Party, but also greatly inspired me and increased my fighting spirit. Although I am still a member of the Communist Youth League today, I will work more actively and enthusiastically than now, strive to learn military affairs, politics, culture, and various scientific knowledge, humbly accept the Party's teachings and the help of comrades, and constantly improve my class consciousness. I will strive to be an excellent League member, and strive to join the Party as soon as possible, to be a revolutionary fighter who will fight to the end for the cause of communism.

### 母亲的进步鼓舞了我

　　母亲的进步鼓舞了我编辑同志：
    已经几个月了，母亲参加了正确、光荣、伟大的中国共产党的消息，仍然像一股巨大的力量一样激荡着我，鞭策着我，使我忍不住要把心里的话说出来，告诉你们，告诉大家。
    我的母亲黄培德，在旧社会里，像千千万万个母亲一样，是一个有封建、迷信思想的农村妇女，一年四季只知道勤劳生产，听天由命地过日子。受了反动统治者的欺侮和毒打，只是暗中哭泣，自叹“命”苦。为了“修修来世”，她还吃斋拜佛。一九四九年年底家乡（四川蓬溪县）解放了，一九五○年初我自愿参加了人民的军队。当时，她的觉悟程度还很低，还痛哭流涕地不肯让我去。在我参军的第一年里，她时常希望我能回本地工作。后来，家乡进行了伟大的土地改革运动，在党和人民政府的教育下，我的母亲开始觉悟了，她开始认识到过去受苦不是由于“命”苦，而是遭到地主阶级剥削的结果，因而她站起来投入了反对封建主义的斗争。
    从此以后，她就积极地参加了村里的各种斗争和工作，先后被选为妇女代表、行政小组长，一九五三年又参加了互助组。村上曾经评给她二十二个代耕工，她坚决不要，自己努力在互助组里劳动，用轻工换重工，解决了生产上的困难。她从不因为自己是个军属而要求特殊待遇，她总是模范地带头执行政府的各项政策，如带头缴好公粮，积极卖余粮，按照国家计划生产等等。因此，一九五三年她被选为全村的军属模范。一九五四年，在党的耐心培养和教导下，经过一年多来党在过渡时期的总路线的学习和社会主义的前途教育，她的社会主义觉悟大大地提高了，十一月二十八日她光荣地参加了中国共产党。十二月又被评选为县的乙等军属模范，得到了奖章一枚、喜报一份、水车一架、锄头一把的奖励。一九五五年一月，她们的联组转成农业生产合作社了，她又被推选为副社长。这些荣誉是从那里来的呢？这都是由于党和人民政府几年来关怀、培养的结果。没有党的教育和关怀，又那能使一个落后的农村妇女逐渐转变为一个先进的、有觉悟的工人阶级的先锋战士？
    母亲的进步，不但使我异常的高兴，衷心地感谢党，而且也大大地鼓舞了我，增加了我的斗志。今天我虽然还是一个青年团员，但是我今后一定要比现在更加积极热情地工作，努力地学习军事、政治、文化和各种科学知识，虚心地接受党的教导和同志们的帮助，不断地提高自己的阶级觉悟，争取做一个优秀团员，并争取早日入党，做一个为共产主义事业奋斗到底的革命战士。海军某部　李澍森
