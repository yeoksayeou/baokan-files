Creative Conception
Wang Chaowen

We repeatedly emphasize going deep into life and studying life, with the aim of constructing thought-provoking artistic conceptions in our creations, creating images with generalizing significance, and providing clear, profound, and novel interpretations of life, so as to effectively educate the people with socialist spirit; not to passively imitate life and replace bold creation with mechanical records. We repeatedly oppose the tendency of formulaic and conceptualized creation, with the aim of ensuring that the concentration and generalization of art do not depart from the specific conditions of life, and that the diversity and multi-faceted nature of life are accurately reflected in the works, avoiding rigid and weak preaching; not to passively imitate life and replace bold creation with mechanical records. "Shifting thoughts to achieve wonderful insights" has always been a requirement of realistic creation. Only through repeated deliberation, turning the various impressions gained from life into images that can fully express the theme, can artistic charm be produced. In the Second National Art Exhibition, the oil painting "Spring Arrives in Tibet" (Dong Xiwen), which the audience felt became more flavorful or more meaningful the more they looked at it, is the result of the author's bold use of imagination and the creative development of conception on the basis of real life.

The creativity of this work is first reflected in the choice of subject matter. We know that the most important thing in art is people, and people's feelings. This work not only depicts the beautiful scenery of Tibet, but also expresses the joy of the people for the great socialist construction of the motherland from one side of life. The impression the painter gained from visiting Tibet was far more than what is depicted in the work; he also remembered many facts, such as the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the presentation of Hada scarves, dancing, and so on. Aren't all these etiquette and customs materials that many painters and photojournalists consistently do not let go of? Aren't these scenes even more lively than the scene depicted in this work? Why fabricate a scene that is not lively? The reason for not repeating the materials taken by other painters and photojournalists, but fabricating this beautiful and realistic scene, is based on the painter's requirement: not to be satisfied with the reproduction of ready-made impressions, but to combine the spring of Tibet with the Tibetan people's spring-like mood for description. The audience does not blame the painter for not painting important scenes in life such as the opening ceremony. Just imagine, if the themes of the opening ceremony, etc., that others have already used, and the forms of expression are repeated, its appeal and persuasiveness will inevitably be weakened. The backs of these Tibetan women who are plowing the land and suddenly paying attention to the car express their mental state of paying attention that crosses the grassland and is connected to the highway, thereby praising the construction of the motherland in a novel and concrete way. Due to the composition of this special plot and scene, the characteristics of the work's style are also obtained. It makes people feel that this kind of praise for construction is not an empty shout, but a soft and gentle chant. I don't think this work is very profound, but in terms of the novelty of conception, it brings new gains to the field of art.

To this day, some people still believe that the success of "Spring Arrives in Tibet" lies in the author's mastery of relatively superior oil painting techniques. Yes, if the snow-capped mountains, blue sky, red apricots, green grass, etc. in this work are not painted beautifully, the theme will not be clear, and the moving effect will be greatly reduced. However, not all painters with technique can paint such moving works. Ignoring the painter's feelings about life, judgments and evaluations of life, and lacking creative conception, one cannot obtain this moving power.

Originality of conception is always the most valuable in creation, especially when artists are still overcoming the "generalization" of themes and the lack of diversity in forms and the insignificance of stylistic differences. Precisely because it expresses the originality of conception, even the color ink painting "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" (Shi Lu), whose technical shortcomings are relatively obvious, is deeply welcomed by the broad audience.

Because of the different personalities of the painters and the different themes of the works, the differences between "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" and "Spring Arrives in Tibet" are obvious in terms of composition, character image, and work style. However, its characters and plots are all boldly fabricated. I once inquired with the author why he chose such a scene. He replied that he didn't care much about the composition method when conceiving, and almost accidentally imagined such a scene. When he went to Wushaoling last year, he suddenly saw a section of railway passing through the Great Wall, and his emotions were strongly stimulated. So he fabricated the characters of these characters and their relationship with the train. This section of railway can cause a strong excitement for the painter, because he has traveled in the grasslands and deserts several times in the past, and painfully felt the difficulty of lacking modern transportation equipment (such as relying on slow livestock to travel on grasslands and deserts where almost no one is seen for thousands of miles). This time, suddenly seeing the railway between the Great Wall triggered many memories and produced a strong impulse to describe it. Because he associated the local Tibetan people's attitude towards this thing, which they were not yet accustomed to but felt loved, he used the impressions he had observed in other occasions about the local people as the embryo for shaping the characters, and painted the Tibetans' ecstasy when they saw the new thing - the train coming.

"Outside the Ancient Great Wall" has the significance of reflecting the great construction, but it does not directly describe the state of being constructed. The author only seizes the moment when the plot is approaching its climax, focusing on expressing the excited mood of the people who want to see the train and are about to see it clearly. In the picture, there is only a railway passing through the Great Wall, and the train does not directly appear in the picture. In addition to focusing on depicting a group of Tibetan herdsmen who are ecstatic when they see the train, a group of sheep running towards the hillside are used as a supplement to the plot and a rendering of the atmosphere. From the perspective of the herdsmen, this is very exciting; from the perspective of the audience, such a realm can also create a vivid impression. Obviously, this event that happened by chance in the corner of the mountain is special, but it is also representative at the same time. It not only illustrates the new changes that have taken place in the remote corners of the mountain, but also focuses on expressing the people in this situation, the state of mind of the people. Because the joy of these few people is highlighted, it also expresses the general people's heartfelt support for these achievements. Because it concretely expresses the joy of the general people for the construction, it can also make people associate the benefits of the construction for the people. We do not require artists to conceive according to any rules. There are various ways to express the joy of the people for the construction. But not any moving plot is adapted to the plastic arts. It is not easy to understand and does not fit the nature of the plastic arts to draw an old man touching the rails on the screen. "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" seized the moment when the herdsmen were excited to paint, and without the explanation of words, the audience could understand its significant theme at a glance. At least in terms of the creativity of conception, this is a better work.

However, it is said that some painters do not approve of such subject matter and composition, saying that it does not fully express the great role of transportation construction and does not clearly express the benefits that the Tibetan people have received after having the train. I think that for the plastic arts, which are good at depicting local and fragmented aspects of life, it is difficult and unnecessary to make it so "complete" and so "clear". Rich content is not all revealed, and clear themes are not completely visible. Those illustrative but also lacking artistic characteristics pictures only tell people that there was such a thing in the audience's impression, and it is difficult to produce the effect of exciting and thought-provoking. It is said that some painters believe that "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" only used the tools of Chinese painting and has no characteristics of Chinese painting at all. Yes, in terms of brushwork and ink, it should be able to better develop the characteristics of traditional Chinese painting. However, this does not prevent the audience from affirming its achievements in subject matter and composition. It should be said that its preciousness lies in developing the strengths of general plastic arts, skillfully forming visual instantaneous phenomena, and generalizing richer content than what is directly depicted on the limited screen with the description of local and fragmented things and phenomena. In terms of the mental state of the characters, this way of description is direct; in terms of the conditions that stimulate the characters to form this mental state, this way of description is indirect. It is not a simple explanation of phenomena, it leaves the audience room for thinking when appreciating, and therefore gives more interest in appreciation. It provides the audience with clues on how to understand and evaluate life, but it does not replace the audience in drawing conclusions and blocking the way to develop imagination. It is also different from some works that cannot provide accurate basis for arousing association: there are such works, drawing some ordinary landscapes on the screen, and there is no sign of any water conservancy projects at all. The author says that the water conservancy projects are "outside the painting", but there is no way to make people have accurate associations and cannot discover certain content. Works like "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" focus on describing the things that must be focused on, boldly abandoning other things that can be described on the same screen, and thus achieve the effect of arousing the audience to generate associations for things outside the painting with the description of limited things. Its content is not completely visible, so it is durable, which is broader than the realm of general works. If the author relaxed all of this when conceiving, even if he used authentic Chinese painting brush and ink techniques, the audience would still not be very interested in it. Authentic Chinese-style brush and ink techniques are not non-existent in many works, but they are not necessarily the source of moving power. Because they do not specifically and generally express the truth of life like "Outside the Ancient Great Wall", the audience has no way to obtain the joy of appreciation. The sketch "Guests from Afar" (Qin Zheng) is also a good work that shows the creativity of conception. It depicts several children in the mountains running to the tent of the geological prospecting team that came last night for sightseeing early in the morning. This interesting plot embodies the welcome of the people in the mountains to the prospecting team, showing the people's love and support for construction, that is, the author's praise for the socialist construction of new China. To express the above themes, of course, there are other ways. For example, how farmers report mines, how prospecting teams survey and map or watch ore attentively, just like those works we often see. However, the painter Qin Zheng did not want to repeat these realistic but not necessarily moving compositions, nor did he repeat the pretentious images that were waiting for others to take pictures. He studied the relationship between the people and guests from afar, and entrusted its essential meaning to the appropriate handling of this original scene and characters. He also did not want to simply obey the limitations of the perspective law, and boldly deleted the prospecting team members who were actually in the foreground of the screen. Only focusing on depicting these children without directly depicting the prospecting team members can not only make the audience imagine their emotional state when they first wake up, but also produces such an effect: let the audience look at these children with the eyes of the prospecting team members. This expression is not suitable for general subject matter, but it is very consistent with the theme of this work. It may not be immediately clear, but it is "more and more meaningful the more you look at it". The style of this work appears very natural, but it is different from those sketches that are published as creations, are bland, have blurred characters' psychology and emotions, and do not see what the author intends to express. It is also different from the artificial expression of the oil painting "Reconnaissance" (Ha Qiongwen), which unilaterally exaggerates the characteristics of courage without regard to vigilance. Its sentiment is beautiful, but it is not a cheap and vulgar beautification of life (unlike those sculptures that unilaterally emphasize the physical without asking about the spirit). Like "Outside the Ancient Great Wall", the achievement of this work in conception is closely related to the author's broad life feelings. The author, who spent eight months of hard but pleasant life with the prospecting team members, is very familiar with the people who explore the treasure mountain and the local people. He is familiar with how they are loved and supported by the people, and he is also familiar with how they are deeply educated by the people. For example, how the children consciously send unknown mountain flowers, how young people run from dozens of miles away to ask to contribute to the prospecting work, how the old man tells folk legends about the treasure mountain, whose broken shoes are repaired overnight without knowing who helped to repair them, and who discovers that there are cooked eggs in the backpack after leaving the village, how they feel more and more that their work meets the needs of the people, and so on. Those painters who ignore the things that are not directly used on the screen and only rely on narrow and poor life knowledge to paint, if they want to get the inspiration of conception from this work, must also attach importance to the most fundamental reason why the author obtained the creativity of conception. But not all those moving things are suitable for expression in the plastic arts, nor are they all easy to accurately express the theme of "Guests from Afar". The painter did not use all these feelings in life casually, thought for a long time, and finally created a novel artistic conception, forming the characteristic of the work that is both natural and not bland. Although conception is the beginning of creation rather than the end, it is the key to success or failure. In the Second National Art Exhibition, there are also works that do not show creativity in conception, and even require painting to explain the problems it is not suitable to explain. As a result, they lack moving power and even confuse the audience. The watercolor painting "Calling on a Patient" (original by Ye Xi, revised by Wang Fuxian and Qu Feng), which aims to express the spirit of internationalism but records the general situation of seeing a doctor, is mainly inferior to "Visiting a Patient" (Huang Zhou) not because the former did not recognize the very important things in life, but because it did not fully develop its imagination when conceiving. The latter does not describe how to see a doctor, but paints the tense state of the doctor on the way, which is a more prominent expression of the doctor's spirit of serving the people without fear of hardship. The oil painting "After Graduation" (Zhuang Yan) not only has problems in content, but also in form, it is not adapted to the special expressiveness of the plastic arts. To put forward excessive requirements for the plastic arts in conception that are not adapted to its strengths is not to improve but to reduce its combat effectiveness. The oil painting "Zhang Mingshan Designs Anti-Encirclement Plate" (Wang Shikui) is not as good as the oil painting "Late Night" (Zuo Hui) in terms of properly expressing the relationship between people in conception. It does not properly arrange details in the composition to fully express how workers overcome difficulties, making the beautiful life on the screen a boring thing. This is an important reason for arousing the audience's dissatisfaction. We oppose low-level tastes, but the taste of art must always be upheld. Only works in which ideological and artistic qualities are unified rather than separated will the audience feel more and more meaningful or more and more flavorful. Not all flavorful works are rich in educational significance, but all educational works should be meaningful. Some other works in the National Art Exhibition, such as "Two Lambs" (color ink painting, Zhou Changgong), which connects the feelings of the shepherdess with the activities of the animals she raises on the screen, "Mother and Daughter Learning Culture" (sculpture, Yuan Xiaocen), which expresses the pure and upward beautiful spirit of the working people, "After School" (sculpture, Pan He), which focuses on depicting children who are attentively treating meaningful games, "Black Shop in the White House" (cartoon, Wu Yun), which uses a familiar metaphor (opening a black shop) to expose the hypocrisy of war-mongers in publicizing "peace", as well as "Reading" (oil painting, Wang Shenglie), "Fulcrum" (cartoon, Yang Keyang), and other more moving works, whether it is said to be interesting, meaningful, charming, or fascinating, are actually just because they seize the most expressive moment, express the beautiful or most concerned things in life, can create strong impressions, and can stimulate corresponding associations. Ingenuity and simplicity are the source of artistic charm, and the two are unified rather than opposed. Thinking that "life is like this" and passively and mechanically imitating life, these works cannot but lose the inherent charm of art. Whether it is a combat scene of great significance or a historical subject, or a portrait painting that should be developed and a landscape painting and flower-and-bird painting that cannot be erased, whether it is a praise for positive characters or an exposure of bad people and bad things, they must all be conceived in an original way.

Facts are the raw materials of creation, not just the plot of the work. Even the same subject matter can have various expressions. Only when the artist can recognize the nature of what he wants to describe, and recognize the significance shown when individual things are connected together, can he develop the originality of conception and form a thought-provoking artistic conception. Highways, railways, and children are actually not new things under normal circumstances; but in the Kangzang Plateau and outside the ancient Great Wall, where these things have never existed before, and in the mountainous areas where the prospecting team has arrived, and connected with the people who are not only feeling new but more importantly feeling happy, they have the role of praising socialist construction. Just as large and small buttons appear very ordinary under normal circumstances, they show the revolutionary leader's hard work and simple style when they appear on Lenin's clothes during the civil war. Ordinary highways, railways, and children can produce a relatively strong and inspiring effect under the special circumstances of "Spring Arrives in Tibet", "Outside the Ancient Great Wall" and "Guests from Afar". If some surface phenomena are reported blindly, superficially, and rigidly, and a variety of things are piled up on the screen without necessary connections, the characters are forced to put on excited postures and expressions, and the ready-made artistic conceptions and even compositions are applied and repeated, it is not only because of the lack of wisdom and effort in conception, but also because of the lack of deep feelings and understanding of life. Only by doubling our efforts in life experience, political cultivation, and artistic cultivation can we create more good works with more profound content, more novel artistic conceptions, and more able to meet the people's appreciation requirements in the future.

    创造性的构思
    王朝闻
    我们一再强调深入生活和研究生活，目的是为了在创作上构成耐人寻味的意境，创造富有概括意义的形象，对生活作出明确的深刻的和新颖的解释，也就是有效地用社会主义精神教育人民；不是为了被动地摹仿生活，用机械的纪录代替大胆的创造。我们一再反对公式化和概念化创作倾向，目的是为了使艺术的集中和概括不离开生活的具体状况，使生活的多样性和多面性在作品中得到确切的反映，避免生硬的无力的说教；也不是为了被动地摹仿生活，用机械的纪录代替大胆的创造。“迁想妙得”一直是现实主义创作的要求，只有反复推敲，把从生活中得来的各种印象变成能够充分表达主题的形象，才能够产生艺术的魅力。在第二届全国美术展览会里，观众认为愈看愈有味道或愈看愈有意思的油画“春到西藏”（董希文），就是作者在现实生活基础上大胆运用了想像力和发挥了构思的创造性的成果。
    这一作品的创造性，首先表现在对于题材的选择。我们知道，艺术中最重要的东西，是人，是人的感受。这一作品不只描写了美丽的西藏的景色，而且从生活的一个侧面，表现了人民对于祖国伟大的社会主义建设的喜悦。画家访问西藏所得的印象，远远不只是作品上所描写到的这一些；他还记得许多事实，例如开车典礼时的剪彩、送哈达、跳舞等等。这一切礼节和风俗，不就是许多画家和摄影记者一贯不放松的素材吗？不正是较之这一作品所描写的场面更热闹得多的场面吗？为什么竟要虚构出一幅并不热闹的场面呢？不重复别的画家和摄影记者的取材，而要虚构出这一美丽的富有真实感的景象，这是基于画家这样的要求：不满足于现成的印象的再现，要把西藏的春天和藏族人民那种春天一样的心情结合起来加以描写。观众不责备画家为什么不画在生活中重要的开车典礼之类的场面。试想，如果重复别人早已用过的开车典礼等等题材和重复那些表现的形式，它的感染力和说服力都难免要削弱。这些正在耕地而又忽然关注着汽车的藏族妇女的背影，表现了她们那种注意力越过草原、同公路联系起来了的精神状态，从而别开生面地具体地歌颂了祖国的建设。由于这一特殊的情节和场面的构成，也获得了作品风格的特点。它使人感到：这种对于建设的歌颂不是空洞的喊叫，而是轻言细语的吟唱。我不以为这一作品已经很深刻，但就构思新颖这一意义而论，它给美术领域带来新的收获。
    至今还有人以为“春到西藏”的成功在于作者掌握了比较优越的油画技术。是的，如果这一作品的雪山、蓝天、红杏、绿草等等画得不美丽，主题就不明确，动人的效果就一定会大为减弱。但是，有技术的画家，并不都画得出这样动人的作品。忽视了画家对于生活的感受、对于生活的判断和评价，缺乏创造性的构思，就不能获得这种动人的力量。
    构思的独创性，在创作上永远是最可宝贵的，特别是艺术家还在克服主题“一般化”和形式不够多样、风格的区别不显著的时候。正因为表现了构思的独创性，即令技术上的缺点比较明显的彩墨画
  “古长城外”（石鲁），也深受广大观众欢迎。
    因为画家的个性不同和作品的题材不同，在构图上、在人物的形象上、在作品的风格上，“古长城外”跟“春到西藏”的区别很明显。但它的人物和情节，也都是大胆虚构出来的。我曾向作者打听过，为什么要选择这样一个场景。回信说构思时并不十分关心构图的方式，几乎是偶然想像出这样一个场景。他去年到乌鞘岭的时候，突然看见穿过长城的一段铁道，情绪受到了强烈的刺激，于是虚构了这些人物的性格和他们同火车的关系。这一段铁路能够引起画家强烈的激动，因为他过去几次在草原和沙漠中旅行，痛感缺少现代的交通设备的困难（例如依靠慢吞吞的牲口，在几乎千里不见人家的草原和沙漠上旅行）。这一次突然看见在长城间的铁道，触发了许多回忆，产生了要加以描写的强烈的冲动。因为联想到当地的藏族人民对于这一虽还没有习惯但却感到喜爱的东西的态度，于是把自己在另外的场合观察得来的有关当地人民的印象作为塑造人物的胚胎，画出藏民看见新事物——火车来了的狂喜。
    “古长城外”具有反映伟大建设的意义，但不是直接描写正在建设的状况。作者只抓住情节接近高潮的瞬间，着重表现想看火车而即将看得分明的人们那种激动的心情。在画面上，只有通过长城的一条铁道，火车不直接出现在画面上。除了着重描写一群看见火车而狂喜的藏族牧民之外，作为情节的补充和气氛的渲染的，是一群奔向山坡的羊。从牧民的角度看来，这是很令人兴奋的；从观众的角度看来，这样的境界也是能够造成鲜明印象的。很明显，这种偶然发生在山角落里的事件，是特殊的，但它同时也是富有代表性的。它不只说明在荒僻的山角落里发生了新的变化，而且着重表现了这一情势之下的人，人的精神状态。因为突出地表现了这几个人的喜悦，也就是表现了一般人民对于这些成就的由衷的拥护的态度。因为它具体地表现了一般人民对于建设的喜悦，也就可以使人联想建设对于人民的好处。我们并不要求美术家按照任何规则来构思，表现人民对于建设的喜悦，还有各种各样的方式。但不是任何动人的情节都和造形艺术相适应，在画面上画一个老汉摸铁轨就不是容易看懂的切合造形艺术的特质的。“古长城外”抓住了牧民心情激动的瞬间来作画，用不着文字的解释，观众一看就懂得它那意义重大的主题。至少就构思的创造性而论，这是一幅较好的作品。
    但是，据说有些画家不赞成这样的取材和构图，说它没有充分表现出交通建设的伟大作用，没有明确表现出藏族人民有了火车之后所得到的好处。我以为对于以描写生活局部和片段见长的造形艺术，如果要它这样“充分”这样“明确”，很难做到，也没有必要。内容丰富不是和盘托出，主题明确不是一览无余；那些图解式的但也就是缺乏艺术特征的图画，在观众的印象中只不过是告诉人有那么一回子事，激动人心和耐人寻味的作用是很难产生的。据说有些画家认为“古长城外”仅仅使用了中国画的工具，完全没有中国画的特色。是的，以用笔和用墨而论，它还应该更能发挥传统的中国画的特点。但是，这并不妨碍观众肯定它在取材和构图方面的成就。应该说，它的可贵之处，在于发挥了一般造形艺术的长处，巧妙地构成了可视的瞬间的现象，以局部和片段的事物和现象的描写，概括了较之有限的画面所直接描写的更丰富的内容。就人物的精神状态而论，这种描写的方式是直接的；就刺激人物形成这种精神状态的条件而论，这种描写的方式是间接的。它不是简单的现象的说明，它给观众留下了在欣赏时运用思考的余地，因而也就给予更多欣赏的兴趣。它给观众提供了怎样认识和评价生活的线索，却没有代替观众做结论，堵塞了发挥想像的道路。它也和某些不能提供唤起联想的确切根据的作品不同：有这样的作品，在画面上画一些普通的山水，根本看不出什么水利工程，作者说水利工程“在画外”，但无从使人发生确切联想，不能发现出一定内容。“古长城外”这样的作品，着重描写了必须着重描写的事物，大胆舍弃了可以在同一画面上描写的其他事物，因而获得了以有限的事物的描写、激起观众产生对于画外事物的联想的效果。它的内容不是一览无余的，所以是经看的，这就较之一般作品的境界更广阔。如果作者在构思时放松了这一切，即令是运用了道道地地的中国画的笔墨技术，观众对它也仍然不太感兴趣的。道道地地的中国式的笔墨技术在许多作品中并不是不存在的，却不一定是动人的力量之所在。因为它们不像“古长城外”这样具体地也是概括地表现了生活的真实，观众便也无从获得欣赏的喜悦。素描“远方来客”（秦征），也是显示了构思的创造性的好作品。它描写了几个山区的小孩，一清早跑到昨晚来临的地质勘察队员的帐篷观光。这一有趣的情节，体现了山区人民对于勘察队的欢迎，表现出人民对于建设的热爱和支持，也就是作者对于新中国社会主义建设的赞扬。要表达上述的主题，当然也还有其他的方式。例如农民怎样报矿，勘察队员怎样测绘地图或聚精会神地察看矿石，正如我们经常看到的那些作品一样。但是，画家秦征不愿重复这些有真实感却不一定动人的构图，也不重复那种等着别人来照像似的矫揉造作的形象，研究了人民和远方来客的关系，使它的本质意义寄托在这一富于独创性的场面和人物的适当处理之中。他也不愿简单服从透视法则的限制，大胆删去了事实上处于画面前景地位的勘察队员。只着重描写这些小孩而不直接描写勘察队员，不只可以使观众想像初醒的他们的情绪状态，而且产生了这样的效果：让观众用勘察队员的眼睛来看待这些孩子。这种表现方式，不适于一般的题材，但它和这一作品的主题十分吻合。看起来容或不是立刻可以了然的，但却是“愈看愈有意思”的。这一作品的风格显得很自然，但和那些当成创作来发表的、平淡无味、人物的心理和情绪模糊、看不出作者企图表现什么思想的速写不同，也和片面夸张勇敢而不顾机警等等特征的油画“侦察”（哈琼文）那种人为的表现方式不同。它的情调是美的，但不是生活的廉价的庸俗的美化（不像那些不问人的精神而片面强调肉体的雕刻一样）。如同“古长城外”一样，这一作品在构思上的成就，和作者广阔的生活感受有密切关系。和勘察队员在一起，过了八个月坚苦而愉快的生活的作者，对于探宝山的人们和当地人民，都很熟悉。他熟悉他们怎样受到人民的热爱和支持，也熟悉他们怎样受到人民深切的教育。例如小孩子们怎样自觉地送来不知名的山花，青年人怎样从几十里外跑来要求为勘察工作出力，老头怎样讲述有关宝山的民间传说，破了的鞋子隔一夜不知谁帮助修补好，离开村庄之后才发现背包里有熟鸡蛋，他们怎样愈来愈觉得自己的工作符合人民的需要，等等。那些忽视不直接用到画面上的东西，仅仅依靠狭窄的贫乏的生活知识作画的画家，如果要从这一作品得到构思的借鉴，也必须重视作者怎样获得构思的创造性的最根本的原因。可是那一切动人的东西，不都宜于用造形艺术来表现，也不都便于确切地表达“远方来客”这样的主题。画家没有随便使用这一切生活中的感受，长时间进行思考，终于创造了新颖的意境，形成了作品既自然又不流于平淡的特色。虽然构思是创作的开始而不是结束，但它是成败的关键。就在第二届全国美术展览会里，也还有因为在构思上没有显出创造性，甚至要求绘画解释它不宜于解释的问题，结果是缺乏动人的力量，甚至是使观众感到困惑的作品。目的是表现国际主义精神，结果是记录了一般的诊病状况的水彩画“出诊”（叶西原作·王复先、屈风改画），其所以较之“出诊图”（黄胄）逊色，主要不是因为前者没有认识到生活中很重要的东西，而是在构思时没有充分发挥想像。后者不描写如何看病而画医生在途中的紧张状态，是较为突出地表现了医生不辞劳苦的为人民服务的精神的。油画“毕业以后”（庄言），不只在内容上还有问题，在形式上，也是没有适应造形艺术的特殊表现力的。构思时对造形艺术提出和它的长处不相适应的过分的要求，不是提高而是降低它的战斗力。油画“张明山设计反围盘”（王式廓），在构思上不如油画“深夜”（左辉）能够适当表现人与人的关系，没有在构图上适当安排足以充分表现工人如何克服困难的细节，使美好的生活在画面上变成乏味的东西，这是引起观众不满的重要原因。我们反对低级的趣味，但艺术的趣味，永远是必须拥护的。只有思想性和艺术性是统一的而不是分裂的作品，观众才会感到愈看愈有意思或愈看愈有味道。不是一切有味道的作品都是富于教育意义的，但一切有教育意义的作品都应该是有意思的。全国美展的其他一些作品，例如把牧羊少女的感情和她饲养的动物的活动在画面上联系着的“两个羊羔”（彩墨画，周昌谷），表现了劳动人民那种纯朴的向上的美的精神的“母女学文化”（雕塑，袁晓岑），着重描写了聚精会神地对待有意义的游戏的孩子们的“课余”（雕塑，潘鹤），运用了人们熟悉的比喻（开黑店）来揭发战争贩子宣传“和平”的虚伪性的“白宫黑店”（漫画，吴耘），以及“阅读”（油画，王盛烈），“支点”（漫画、杨可扬），等等较为动人的作品，说它有趣也好，说它有意义也好，说它富有魅力也好，说它引人入胜也好，其实不过因为抓住了最富于表现力的瞬间，表现了生活中的美好的或最引人关心的东西，能够创造强烈的印象，可以激发相应的联想。巧妙和朴素是艺术的魅力之所在，二者是统一的而不是对立的。以为“生活本来就是这个样子”而被动地机械地摹仿生活，这些作品就不能不丧失艺术应有的魅力。不论是具有重大意义的战斗场面和历史题材，还是应该发展的肖像画和不可抹煞的风景画、花鸟画，不论是对于正面人物的表扬，还是对于坏人坏事的揭发，都必须是别出心裁地构思出来的。
    事实是创作的原料而不就是作品的情节，就是同样的题材，也还可以有各种各样的表现方式。只有当艺术家能够认识所要描写的东西的性质，认识各别事物联系在一起时所显示的意义，才能够发挥构思的独创性，形成耐人寻味的意境。公路、铁道和小孩，在一般情况之下，其实是并不新奇的东西；但是在从来没有过这些东西的康藏高原和古长城外，以及勘察队所到的山区，而且同不只是感到新奇更重要的是感到喜悦的人民联系在一起，才具备了歌颂社会主义建设的作用。正如大大小小的钮扣在一般情况之下，显得很平常，出现在内战时期的列宁的衣服上，就显示出革命领袖的艰苦和朴实作风一样，一般的公路、铁道和小孩在“春到西藏”、“古长城外”和“远方来客”这种特殊情势之下，能够产生比较强烈的激动人心的效果。如果盲目地肤浅地死板地报道一些表面现象，缺乏必然联系地在画面上堆集了杂多的事物，强迫人物装出激动的姿态和表情，套用和重复现成的意境以至构图，不只因为缺乏构思的智慧和努力，也由于对生活缺乏深切的感受和认识。我们只有在生活体验、政治修养和艺术修养上加倍努力，今后才会创造出更多内容更深刻，意境更新颖，更能满足人民欣赏要求的好作品。
