　　Shanghai Cultural and Educational Supplies Manufacturing Industry Saves Copper
    The Shanghai cultural and educational supplies manufacturing industry is universally saving copper. Currently, 54 products have successively adopted substitutes, which can save the country more than 490,000 kilograms of copper materials annually.
    The Shanghai Municipal Cultural and Educational Supplies Manufacturing Industry needs to use copper in more than 270 varieties of products. In the past, the amount of copper materials consumed was quite large. Since the People's Government called for saving copper, they have conducted research on various copper-using products and carried out copper material saving and substitution work throughout the industry. For example, the private Dapeng Stationery Factory's pencil sharpeners, pen holders, calendar stamps, and number stamps used to be inseparable from copper. Some products were almost entirely made of copper materials. In the work of saving, after more than two months of repeated research, the workers of this factory first changed the copper skin frames on calendar stamps and number stamps, which were relatively difficult to substitute, to iron skin frames, and all pen holders, which used the most copper, were changed to iron products. In the process of researching saving and substitution, the workers worked hard to overcome various difficulties. Everyone improved and exchanged experiences at the same time. In order to strengthen rust prevention performance and reduce costs, the workers tried to change iron plating to baking varnish or other chemical liquids. Now, this factory no longer manufactures any products using copper; according to the current output, it can save the country more than 25,000 kilograms of copper materials annually. All products have reduced costs due to the implementation of saving and substitution. A kind of number stamp that used to sell for six yuan, eight jiao and six fen a dozen now sells for only four yuan and five jiao. The quality is not only completely equal to copper products, but also the style is beautiful and the weight is reduced, which is very popular with consumers.

### 上海文教用品制造业节约用铜

　　上海文教用品制造业节约用铜
    上海文教用品制造业普遍节约用铜，目前已经有五十四种产品陆续采用代用品，每年可给国家节约铜料四十九万多公斤。
    上海市文教用品制造业需要用铜的品种有二百七十多种，以往耗费铜料的数量相当大，从人民政府号召节约用铜以来，他们分别对各项用铜产品进行了研究，在全业范围内开展了铜料节约代用工作。如私营大鹏文具厂生产的卷笔机、接笔套、日历印和号码印等产品，过去都离不了铜，有的产品几乎全部是用铜料制造的。这个厂的工人在节约工作中，经过两个多月的反复研究，先把代用比较困难的日历印、号码印上的铜皮架改成铁皮架，并把用铜最多的接笔套等全部改作铁制品。在研究节约代用过程中，工人们努力克服了各种困难，大家一边改进，一边交流经验。为了加强防锈效能和降低成本，工人们设法把镀铁改为镀烘漆或其他化学液体。现在，这个厂已经没有一样产品是用铜制造的；按照目前的产量，每年可为国家节约铜料二万五千多公斤。全部产品都因为实行节约代用而降低了成本。过去卖六元八角六分一打的一种号码印，现在只卖四元五角。质量不但和铜制品完全相等，而且式样美观，重量减轻，大受消费者欢迎。
