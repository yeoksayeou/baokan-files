Xinhua News Agency, May 21st. Recently, 148 representatives from various units of the Naval Aviation Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army convened in Beijing. At the meeting, they extensively introduced their deeds and experiences in performing the glorious tasks of liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands, including combat and training.

Since its establishment, the Naval Aviation Force has made significant achievements in all aspects. In 1954, under the unified leadership and command of higher authorities, the frontline units of the Naval Aviation Force closely coordinated with fraternal forces to carry out tasks such as liberating enemy-occupied islands off the coast of Zhejiang and escorting ships and fishing boats. They also fiercely bombed Chiang Kai-shek's troops on islands such as Dachen, Yijiangshan, and Yushan, killing and wounding a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and destroying many of their technical equipment and positions. Among the representatives attending this meeting were pilot Bao Ximing, who shot down a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and insisted on flying his damaged plane back to base; pilot Song Guoqing, who shot down and damaged three U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft; Ma Liancheng, who set a safety flight record of four years and eight months and led his fleet courageously through the clouds to bomb the Chiang Kai-shek troops' positions on Dachen Island; flight instructor Wang Yulin, who dedicated himself to the cause of aviation teaching; and Zhou Kongliang, the representative of a certain aircraft maintenance team that ensured the safe takeoff and landing of aircraft without any accidents for three years and six months.

At the meeting, Bao Ximing, Ma Liancheng, and Liu Youxiao, the representative of a certain aircraft maintenance team, and six others reported on their deeds and experiences, and the representatives had a lively discussion on these reports.

The Naval leaders called on all the representatives present and all officers and soldiers of the Naval Aviation Force to intensify the training of troops, continue to carry forward the spirit of diligent study and hard work, and quickly master advanced flight techniques, in order to build a modern and regularized People's Naval Aviation Force, and to be ready at all times to cooperate with fraternal forces to liberate Taiwan and defend the territorial waters and airspace of the motherland.
