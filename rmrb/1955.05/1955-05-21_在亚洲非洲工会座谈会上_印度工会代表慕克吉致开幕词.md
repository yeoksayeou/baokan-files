Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: At the Asian-African Trade Union Conference that opened on the 18th, Indian trade union representative B. K. Mukherjee delivered the opening speech. Mukherjee said that he was extremely pleased to announce the start of this long-awaited informal and friendly symposium of trade union representatives from Asian and African countries in Beijing. He first thanked the Japanese trade union representatives for initiating the convening of this informal, friendly, and peaceful meeting. He thanked the Indonesian trade union representatives for making significant contributions to implementing this proposal, and he thanked the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for making excellent arrangements for the convenience of this gathering.

Mukherjee said: "I am confident that this friendly atmosphere will enable us to discuss issues of common interest to enhance and strengthen solidarity and friendly relations between trade union organizations in Asia and Africa. I have no doubt in my mind that I am expressing the feelings of all those present when I say this."

Mukherjee continued: "Since this is an informal and friendly gathering for heart-to-heart talks, this meeting cannot have strict rules of procedure, but it is hoped that we will all be tolerant of others. Representatives from participating countries have held two meetings and decided to mainly focus our discussions on the following two points: peace and the prohibition of the production and use of nuclear weapons. Before we discuss any issues, I know that all of you are very eager to get to know each other, to know each other's names, countries, and the industries and sectors represented. I fully agree with this request, as it will form the basis of the main purpose of this gathering, which is the solidarity between Asian and African trade unions and, through this solidarity, the promotion of cooperation and friendship between countries in the region."

Mukherjee added: "Although our discussions at this gathering are not pre-planned, and we do not intend to pass any resolutions or take any measures after the discussions, the recent Asian-African Conference in Bandung has undoubtedly encouraged us to gather here to establish closer understanding among ourselves. Therefore, our efforts here will be of great value and will have a broad impact. Like the Bandung Conference, we will also strive to find ways to reach agreements among ourselves, temporarily setting aside points of disagreement. Since our purpose is just and our intentions are sincere, I am confident that we will find more common ground than differences in our discussions."

Mukherjee finally emphasized that atomic and hydrogen weapons have deepened the threat of war. He called on the working class of Asia and Africa to work together to stop war and strive for world peace. Speaking of weapons of mass destruction, he said, "Asia knows the horrors caused by these destructive weapons. Therefore, we must focus on preventing war, and we will spare no effort to establish and maintain peace. The working class of all countries are the architects of building prosperous and happy countries, but when war threatens people's nerves and when there is no peace and security, the working class and their countries cannot achieve prosperity and happiness. Therefore, striving to establish and maintain world peace is our fundamental goal. This goal can be achieved through the unremitting efforts of individual countries and collectively. We must seize this opportunity to reach an agreement and issue our collective voice against war and for peace, thereby advancing the goals unanimously agreed upon by the countries participating in the Bandung Conference."

　　在亚洲非洲工会座谈会上
　　印度工会代表慕克吉致开幕词
    新华社二十日讯　印度工会代表比·库·慕克吉在十八日开幕的亚洲非洲工会座谈会上致开幕词。慕克吉说，他以极大的高兴来宣布这个盼望已久的聚集在北京的亚非国家工会代表的不拘形式的友谊座谈会的开始，他首先感谢日本工会代表发起召开这一不拘形式的友好的气氛平和的会议，感谢印度尼西亚工会代表对于贯彻这一建议作出了重大贡献，感谢中华全国总工会为这次的聚会的便利作出了良好的安排。
    慕克吉说：“我确信这一友好的气氛会使我们有可能讨论我们具有共同兴趣的问题，以增进和加强亚非各国工会组织之间的团结和友好关系。我心中毫不怀疑，我这样说是表达了全体到会者的感情的。”
    慕克吉接着说：“由于这是一个倾心相谈的不拘形式的友好聚会，这个会议就不能有严格的议事规则，但是希望我们大家都应当对旁人表示容忍。与会各国的代表们举行过两次会议，决定主要地集中我们的讨论在下列两点上：和平与禁止生产及使用核子武器。在我们未讨论任何问题之前，我知道你们大家都很想认识一下，知道彼此的姓名、国家和所代表的行业和产业。我完全赞同这种要求，因为它将成为这一聚会的主要目的的基础，这一目的就是亚非各国工会之间的团结并通过这种团结促进本区各国之间的合作和友好。”
    慕克吉又说：“虽然我们在这个聚会里的讨论不是预先计划好的，我们也不打算通过任何决议，不准备在讨论之后采取任何措施，但是由于亚非各国最近在万隆开了一次会议，会议的成就无疑地鼓舞了我们在此聚会，在我们之间建立更密切的了解。因此，我们在此所作的努力将具有重大的价值，并将产生广大的影响。如同万隆会议一样，我们也将努力寻求在我们之间达成协议的方法，暂时不谈意见相异之点。由于我们的目的是正义的，由于我们的企图是诚实的，我确信我们会在讨论中发现较多的共同点而不是不同点。”
    慕克吉最后强调原子武器和氢武器加深了战争的威胁，他吁请亚非各国工人阶级共同努力来制止战争、争取世界和平。他谈到大规模毁灭性的核子武器时说，“亚洲是知道这些破坏性武器所造成的恐怖的，因此，我们必须集中注意防止战争，我们将不遗余力地来建立和维护和平。各国工人阶级是建设繁荣幸福国家的建筑师，但是当战争威胁着人民的神经、当没有和平和安全的时候，工人阶级和他们的国家是不能得到繁荣和幸福的。因此，争取建立和维护世界和平就成为我们的基本目的。通过各国的个别和集体的不懈努力，这种目的是可以实现的，我们必须利用这个机会达成协议，发出我们集体的呼声，反对战争，争取和平，从而推进万隆会议与会国家一致同意的目的。”
