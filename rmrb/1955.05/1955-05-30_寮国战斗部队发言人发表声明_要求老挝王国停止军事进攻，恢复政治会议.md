　　Lao Fighting Forces Spokesman Issues Statement
　　Demanding that the Kingdom of Laos Cease Military Offensives and Resume Political Conferences
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 28th (Dispatch) - Lao News: The spokesman for the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces issued a statement on the 17th regarding the recent situation in the Muong Phanh area of Sam Neua Province, demanding that the Royal Lao Government cease its military offensives against the Lao Fighting Forces and resume political conferences to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

      The statement said that Muong Phanh is a location within the Lao Fighting Forces' assembly area in Sam Neua Province. However, after the ceasefire, the Royal Lao Government airdropped officers, gathered local bandits to harass the area, and dispatched troops from Xieng Khouang to attack Muong Phanh. They first occupied Muong Phanh on January 2nd of this year and then launched a second, larger-scale offensive against Muong Phanh from February 28th to March 4th. To avoid escalating the conflict, the Lao Fighting Forces voluntarily withdrew from Muong Phanh during both offensives directed by the Royal Government and stationed themselves in the surrounding areas.

    The statement further cited facts pointing out that from the time the Lao Fighting Forces and the Royal Government signed the agreement to cease hostilities on the Plaine des Jarres on March 9th until now, the Royal Government has continuously increased its provocative attacks against the Lao Fighting Forces in Muong Phanh, seizing some nearby locations. At the same time, the Royal Government has continuously reinforced its troops in Muong Phanh and conducted reconnaissance activities with aircraft.

    The statement pointed out that the Royal Government is using every means to expand its occupied area in the Muong Phanh region, attempting to use this area as a springboard for further encroachment into nearby areas.

      The statement condemned the Royal Government for interrupting political conferences while conducting military offensives, refusing to continue negotiations with the Lao Fighting Forces to resolve the fundamental political issues related to both Lao sides—including the issue of the two provinces.

    The statement said that these actions by the Royal Government seriously violate Articles 14 and 19 of the Geneva Accords and violate the agreement to cease hostilities signed on the Plaine des Jarres on March 9th.

    The statement finally demanded that the Royal Government immediately cease its military hostilities against the Lao Fighting Forces in Muong Phanh and other areas in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and demanded that the Royal Government resume political conferences, sincerely negotiate, and strictly implement the Geneva Accords in order to consolidate peace, guarantee the democratic freedoms of the people, and achieve unification and complete independence.

　　寮国战斗部队发言人发表声明
　  要求老挝王国停止军事进攻，恢复政治会议
    新华社河内二十八日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人在十七日就桑怒省芒奔地区的最近情势发表声明，要求老挝王国政府停止对寮国战斗部队的军事进攻，恢复政治会议，使日内瓦协议获得彻底履行。
      声明说，芒奔是桑怒省寮国战斗部队集结区中的一个地方。但是，老挝王国政府在停战后就空投军官，纠合当地土匪骚扰，并从川圹派遣军队进攻芒奔，在今年一月二日首次占领芒奔，二月二十八日到三月四日又更大规模地向芒奔进行第二次进攻。寮国战斗部队为了避免战事扩大，在王国政府指挥的两次进攻中，都自动撤出了芒奔，并在周围地区驻扎。
    声明又列举事实指出，从寮国战斗部队和王国政府三月九日在查尔平原签订停止敌对行动协议起到现在为止，王国政府不断在芒奔增加对寮国战斗部队的挑衅进攻，侵占了附近的一些地方。同时王国政府不断增援在芒奔的军队，用飞机进行侦察活动。
    声明指出，王国政府正在利用一切办法扩大芒奔地区的占领范围，企图利用这一地区作为跳板，进一步侵占附近地区。
      声明谴责王国政府在进行军事进攻的同时中断政治会议，不肯和寮国战斗部队继续进行谈判来解决和老挝双方有关的基本政治问题——其中包括两省问题。
    声明说，王国政府的这些行为严重地违反了日内瓦协定第十四条和十九条，违背了三月九日在查尔平原签订的停止敌对行动协议。
    声明最后要求王国政府立即停止它在芒奔和在桑怒、丰沙里两省中的其他地区对寮国战斗部队的军事敌对行动，要求王国政府恢复政治会议，真诚协商，严格地履行日内瓦协定，以便巩固和平，保证人民的民主自由，实现统一，完成独立。
