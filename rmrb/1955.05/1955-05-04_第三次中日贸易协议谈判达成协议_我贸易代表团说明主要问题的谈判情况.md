Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd. The representatives of the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan and the Japanese negotiators held a plenary meeting at the Teito Hotel in Tokyo on the evening of the 2nd.

　　The meeting discussed the draft of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement proposed by the drafting committees of both sides, and reached a consensus.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd. Zhang Jiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan, held a press conference on the afternoon of the 2nd. On behalf of the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan, he explained the negotiation situation on the major issues in the Sino-Japanese trade negotiations in the recent period. Zhang Jiming said that an agreement had been reached in the negotiations for the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and a signing ceremony would be held on the morning of the 4th.

　　He went on to say: From April 19th to the present, the focus of the negotiations has been concentrated on the issues of concluding a payment agreement, establishing permanent commercial representative offices, and the assumption of responsibility by both governments, which are of great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese trade. He pointed out that the issues of concluding a payment agreement and establishing commercial representative offices were matters that both parties had already agreed to complete in the memorandum attached to the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. This is because both parties at that time had already recognized the important relationship of these issues to the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The implementation of the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has also proved that these issues must be resolved as soon as possible.

　　Zhang Jiming then explained the constructive suggestions put forward by the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan in the negotiations and the attitudes of both sides on the issues of the payment agreement, the establishment of commercial representative offices, and the assumption of government responsibility.

　　Regarding the payment issue, our side initially suggested that the national banks of both sides conclude a payment agreement. The Japanese side proposed that the Bank of Tokyo and the Bank of China conclude a payment agreement. During the discussions, the Japanese side revised its proposal to a payment agreement scheme in which the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China would settle accounts in yen. However, when our side expressed its agreement in principle to conduct discussions based on the Japanese side's scheme of settlement in yen by the national banks, the Japanese side stated that there were still difficulties and proposed that a committee be jointly organized by both sides to discuss and promote the conclusion of a payment agreement by the national banks of both sides. Our side advocated that representatives of the national banks of both sides should directly negotiate immediately. The Japanese side stated that direct negotiations were difficult and proposed indirect negotiations, that is, the Japanese side would first discuss and finalize a plan with the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, and then discuss it with our side. The Japanese side also stated that it would strive to formally conclude a payment agreement between July and September of this year. Although our side knew that indirect negotiations could not solve the problem, it agreed to the Japanese side's attempt because the Japanese side repeatedly requested it. As a result, the Japanese side stated that it had encountered difficulties again and withdrew the original proposal.

　　Regarding the issue of establishing permanent commercial representative offices, our side believes that this institution should be an authoritative, efficient institution that can solve various trade-related issues, rather than a purely decorative formality. To this end, our side advocates that it should be a representative institution of the administrative organs of the state managing foreign trade; this institution and its staff should enjoy the rights of diplomatic personnel. In the negotiations, the Japanese side proposed that it be sent by non-governmental organizations. Our side explained that such an institution could not play a role. After discussion, the Japanese side also agreed that our side's opinion was correct and approved of our side's plan, but stated that it was difficult to establish such an institution now.

　　Regarding the issue of government responsibility, our side believes that in order to develop trade between countries and establish normal trade relations, the government must assume the responsibilities and obligations it should bear. The reason why the results of the implementation of the first two Sino-Japanese trade agreements were not satisfactory was that the Japanese government at that time did not assume its due responsibilities. In the process of discussing the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement this time, there are many issues that need to be resolved by the Japanese government assuming responsibility. Our side believes that in order to develop Sino-Japanese trade, this issue must be resolved, and the time to resolve this issue has come.

　　Zhang Jiming then cited the facts that people from all walks of life and the business community in Japan had recently held gatherings requesting the Japanese government to assume responsibility for Sino-Japanese trade negotiations, conclude a payment agreement, establish commercial representative offices, and lift the embargo. He pointed out that these calls reflected the urgent desire of people from all walks of life in Japan to develop Sino-Japanese trade, and showed that they had realized which important issues should be resolved in order to develop Sino-Japanese trade and what the key to solving these issues was. Zhang Jiming went on to say that in order to enable the negotiations to reach an agreement quickly and not affect the current trade between the two countries, the Chinese trade delegation had taken the initiative to make concessions and suggested including in the agreement that "the payment and settlement matters of transactions between the two sides will be handled by the People's Bank of China and the Bank of Japan signing a payment agreement and opening a clearing account" and "the two sides agree to establish permanent commercial representative offices in each other's countries… The commercial representative offices and personnel of the representative offices of both sides enjoy the privileges of diplomatic treatment…; both sides also agree to work hard to realize it as soon as possible." This enabled the negotiations of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to reach an agreement.

　　Zhang Jiming finally pointed out that this negotiation solved a number of specific problems, and some other problems also made progress, such as the mutual holding of commodity exhibitions. However, issues that play an important role in developing Sino-Japanese trade and normalizing Sino-Japanese trade relations still need to be continuously worked on in the future.

### 第三次中日贸易协议谈判达成协议  我贸易代表团说明主要问题的谈判情况

　　第三次中日贸易协议谈判达成协议
    我贸易代表团说明主要问题的谈判情况
　　新华社东京三日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团的代表和日本方面的谈判代表二日晚在东京帝都饭店举行了全体会议。
    会上讨论了由双方起草委员会提出的第三次中日贸易协议草案，并取得了一致意见。
    新华社东京三日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团副秘书长张纪明在二日下午举行了记者招待会。他代表中国访问日本贸易代表团就最近一个时期中日贸易谈判中的主要问题的谈判情况作了说明。张纪明说，第三次中日贸易协议的谈判已经达成协议，将在四日上午举行签字仪式。
      他接着说：从四月十九日到现在，谈判的重点是集中在对发展中日贸易有重要关系的缔结支付协定、互设常驻商务代表机构以及双方政府承担责任的问题上。他指出，缔结支付协定和互设商务代表机构问题，是第二次中日贸易协议所附的备忘录中双方早已约定要完成的事项。这是由于当时双方已经认识到这些问题对于发展中日贸易的重要关系。第二次中日贸易协议的执行情况也证明了这些问题必须尽早解决。
    张纪明接着就支付协定、设立商务代表机构和政府承担责任问题，分别说明了中国访问日本贸易代表团在谈判中提出的建设性建议和双方的态度。
    关于支付问题，我方在一开始就建议由双方的国家银行缔结支付协定。日方则提议由东京银行和中国银行缔结支付协定。在商谈过程中，日方改提由日本银行和中国人民银行缔结以日元结汇的支付协定方案。但当我方表示原则上同意以日方由国家银行以日元结汇这一方案为基础进行商谈时，日方又表示还有困难，并提议由双方共同组织一个委员会来商谈和促进双方的国家银行缔结支付协定。我方主张立即由双方国家银行的代表直接商谈。日方表示直接谈判有困难，提议间接商谈，即由日方先和日本银行和大藏省谈妥方案，然后再来和我方商谈，日方并表示要努力争取在今年七、八、九月间正式缔结支付协定。我方虽然知道间接谈判不可能解决问题，但因日方一再要求，同意了日方去尝试。结果，日方表示又遭到了困难，撤回了原案。
    关于互设常驻商务代表机构问题，我方认为这一机构应该是有权力的，有效率的，能解决有关贸易的各项问题的机构，而不是形式上的装饰品。为此，我方主张它应是国家管理对外贸易的行政机关的代表机构；这一机构及其工作人员应享有外交人员待遇的权利。在谈判中，日方提议由民间团体派出。我方说明这样的机构是不可能发挥作用的。经过讨论，日方也认为我方的意见是对的，并赞成我方的方案，但表示现在就设立这样机构是有困难的。
    关于政府承担责任的问题，我方认为要发展国家之间的贸易，建立正常的贸易关系，就必须由政府承担起应负的责任和义务。前两次中日贸易协议执行结果之所以不能令人满意，原因就在于当时的日本政府未承担应负的责任。这次在商谈第三次中日贸易协议的过程中，有许多问题需要由日本政府承担起责任来才能解决。我方认为，要发展中日贸易，就必须解决这一问题，而且解决这个问题的时机也已经到了。
    张纪明接着引证了最近期间日本各界人士和企业界纷纷集会要求日本政府对中日贸易谈判承担责任、缔结支付协定、互设商务代表机构、解除禁运等事实，指出这些呼声反映了日本各界人士要求发展中日贸易的迫切愿望，说明了他们已经认识到为了发展中日贸易应该解决那些重要问题以及解决这些问题的关键何在。张纪明接着说，中国贸易代表团为了使谈判迅速达成协议，不影响两国间现在的贸易，已经主动地作了让步，建议在协议中列入“双方交易的支付和清算事宜将由中国人民银行同日本银行签订支付协定，开立清算帐户办理”以及“双方同意，相互在对方国中设置常驻商务代表机构……双方商务代表机构及代表机构人员享有外交官待遇的特权……；双方并同意努力促其尽早实现”。这样就使第三次中日贸易协议的谈判达成了协议。
    张纪明最后指出，这次谈判解决了若干具体问题，另外一些问题也获得了进展，例如双方相互举办商品展览会等问题。但是，对发展中日贸易和使中日贸易关系正常化具有重要作用的问题，还有待于今后的继续努力。
