　　Economic Contradictions Between the US and France in South Vietnam
　　Zhou Meisheng
    The civil war instigated by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, under the direction of the United States, is still raging fiercely, and the situation is extremely chaotic. This development is a malignant consequence of the US imperialist policy of intervention and, at the same time, a reflection of the intensifying contradictions between the US and France in this region.
    Since the Geneva Conference, the US policy in South Vietnam has been to undermine the Geneva Accords, divide Vietnam, and use South Vietnam as a base to prepare for a new war. At the same time, the US has also used its puppet Ngo Dinh Diem clique in an attempt to completely squeeze France out of South Vietnam and turn it into a US-dominated colony. The US's war policy of undermining the Geneva Accords has not provoked any opposition from French officials. However, the US expansion in South Vietnam has greatly weakened France's economic and political position, which cannot but provoke French resistance.
    US monopoly capital is extremely covetous of the rich resources of Indochina. The "New York Times," mouthpiece of US monopoly capital, openly admitted: "Indochina is an object worth betting on. The north has tin, tungsten, zinc, manganese, coal, timber, and rice for export, and the south has rice, rubber, tea, pepper, livestock, hides, and so on." The US aggressors also make no secret of their intention to squeeze out France. The "Wall Street Journal" reported on October 8, 1954, that "Dulles's aim is to gradually get France to withdraw from Indochina." Representative Richards, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly declared on December 13 last year that "the French should withdraw from Vietnam one hundred percent—politically, economically, and militarily." While establishing its political and military control over South Vietnam, US monopoly capital squeezed France economically in all aspects.
    US monopoly capital first seized France's sales market in South Vietnam and stepped up the plunder of South Vietnam's strategic raw materials. According to figures revealed by British and French newspapers, in October of last year, the number of US goods shipped into South Vietnam had increased to second only to French goods, while US imports from South Vietnam (93 million piastres) had greatly exceeded South Vietnam's exports to France (62 million piastres). In particular, in the plunder of strategic raw materials, the US has already far surpassed France. The French newspaper "Echo" said in November last year: "If we know that the US is currently purchasing three times as much Indochinese rubber as France (68 percent of the product is bought by the US), then the infiltration of US interests is very clear." Rubber is one of South Vietnam's main products, accounting for nearly half of South Vietnam's total exports in 1953.
    This year, the US is again using "direct" "US aid" to South Vietnam as a means to further control the South Vietnamese market and weaken the economic ties between France and South Vietnam. In 1955, US direct "economic aid" to South Vietnam will reach 240 million US dollars, mainly used to purchase goods from the US and Japan. The British "Economist" magazine wrote: "The inevitable result of this new arrangement is a reduction in imports from France or other parts of the French Federation, giving way to goods from the dollar area. In fact, since January 1st, about 80 percent of South Vietnam's total imports have been paid for by US economic aid." In this way, under the guise of "aid," the US surplus commodities have flooded every corner of South Vietnam, squeezing out local industry and commerce, as well as French imports. The South Vietnamese "Chimes" newspaper complained that although South Vietnam produces tobacco and its rivers are full of fish, South Vietnam is still importing US tobacco and canned fish. French capitalists are also greatly disturbed by this. The Paris "Figaro" said that this measure "seriously damages trade between France and Saigon" and will "cause France to lose its best customer except for Algeria." The Paris "Le Monde" predicted that in 1955, the amount of goods imported into Indochina from the franc zone will not exceed 25 billion francs, while it was 114 billion francs in 1953. The "Le Monde" correspondent in Saigon said sadly: "French industrialists do not have much hope of maintaining their position in South Vietnam."
    US capital infiltration into South Vietnam has long begun. The vast majority of companies engaged in the mining of strategic raw materials in South Vietnam are directly or indirectly related to US capital. Now, US monopoly capital is using its control in South Vietnam to replace the position of French capital on a larger scale. According to the London "Observer," the Americans "are buying important industrial enterprises through the South Vietnamese government... In contrast, most French are rushing to sell their property." According to Saigon newspaper reports, the French "Indochina Brewing Company," which previously held a monopoly on the entire Indochina region, and the "Charner Department Store" in Saigon have been sold to Americans.
    Yes, the US is not only hitting French interests in trade, but also seizing the right to issue currency and manage finances in South Vietnam. In November of last year, the Paris "Echo" revealed that several South Vietnamese associations and some US banks had held negotiations to study the establishment of a private banknote issuing agency controlled by US monopoly capital in South Vietnam. In January of this year, the US forced France to hand over the power to issue currency and manage financial activities, which was previously held by the French Bank, to the US-controlled South Vietnamese Bank. This has greatly facilitated US monopoly capital in developing its power in South Vietnam and further squeezing out French economic power.
    The US's incremental squeeze of France in South Vietnam cannot but cause great panic and dissatisfaction among the French bourgeoisie. The French "Combat" wrote indignantly: "It is not the other party (referring to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) that is squeezing us out, but our allies (referring to the US)!" On March 20, France and South Vietnam signed an economic agreement stipulating mutual preferential tariff rights and expanding the import quotas of certain types of goods. This was a struggle by France to protect its market in South Vietnam. France also attempted to use the contradictions between the various sects in South Vietnam and Ngo Dinh Diem to drive Ngo Dinh Diem out of office and send Bao Dai back to South Vietnam to maintain its position. US International News Service once reported on France's plan, saying: "French colonial enterprises are estimated to own 80 percent of the wealth in South Vietnam, and they hope to keep this wealth. French companies believe that if Bao Dai continues to be in power, they will be able to continue to maintain it." However, this aroused a more violent blow from the US and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The US openly supported Ngo Dinh Diem in using force to suppress the forces of the various sects, provoking the civil war in South Vietnam, and instigated the "deposal" of Bao Dai, while at the same time exerting tremendous pressure on France, demanding that France accept the US arrangements in South Vietnam. As a result of the recent US-French talks, the French government once again succumbed to US pressure and agreed to support the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet prime minister. However, the fundamental contradictions between the two colonialists, the US and France, have not been resolved. Their scheming and infighting continue to develop.
    The situation in South Vietnam shows that the US intervention policy not only endangers peace in Indochina and threatens the safety of South Vietnamese residents, but is also violently squeezing out France, replacing France and turning South Vietnam completely into a US colony. The French ruling group, following the US in undermining the Geneva Accords and adopting a policy of step-by-step surrender to the US, will eventually find that they are lifting a stone only to drop it on their own feet.

　　美法在南越的经济矛盾
　　周梅生
    美国指使吴庭艳集团在南越挑起的内战仍在激烈进行中，局势非常混乱。这种局势的发展是美帝国主义的干涉政策所造成的恶果，同时也是美国和法国在这个地区矛盾尖锐化的反映。
    自日内瓦会议以后，美国在南越推行的政策是要破坏日内瓦协议，分裂越南，利用南越为基地准备新的战争；与此同时，美国也利用它的傀儡吴庭艳集团，企图把法国从南越彻底排挤出去，将南越变为美国独占的殖民地。美国破坏日内瓦协议的战争政策，并没有引起法国官方的任何反对。但是美国在南越的扩张大大地削弱了法国的经济和政治地位，却不能不引起法国的抵抗。
    美国垄断资本十分垂涎印度支那的丰富资源。美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”曾公开承认：“印度支那是值得大赌一下的对象。北部有可以输出的锡、钨、锌、锰、煤、木材和大米，南部有米、橡胶、茶叶、胡椒、牲畜、牛羊皮等等。”美国侵略者也毫不掩饰它要排挤法国的意图。“华尔街日报”在一九五四年十月八日报道，“杜勒斯的目的是要使法国逐渐从印度支那退出去。”美国众议院外交委员会主席理查兹去年十二月十三日并公开宣称，要“法国人百分之百地——政治上、经济上和军事上——退出越南”。在美国建立它对南越的政治上和军事上的控制的同时，美国垄断资本就从经济上各方面排挤法国。
    美国垄断资本首先是抢夺法国在南越的销售市场，并加紧掠夺南越的战略原料。据英法报纸透露的数字，在去年十月份，美国商品运入南越的数字已增加到仅次于法国货，而美国从南越的进口（九千三百万皮阿斯特），则已大大超过了南越对法国的输出（六千二百万皮阿斯特）。特别是在掠夺战略原料方面，美国更是已经远远超越了法国。法国“回声报”在去年十一月说：“假如我们知道美国目前购买的印度支那橡胶为法国的三倍（百分之六十八的产品被美国买去），那末美国利益的渗入就非常明确了。”橡胶是南越的主要产品之一，在一九五三年占南越出口货物总值的将近一半。
    今年，美国又以“直接”给予南越“美援”为手段来进一步控制南越的市场，并削弱法国和南越的经济联系。一九五五年美国直接给予南越的“经济援助”将达二亿四千万美元，主要用来购买美国和日本的商品。英国“经济学家”杂志写道：“这个新安排的不可避免的结果，就是来自法国或法国联邦的其他部分的进口货减少，而让位于来自美元区的货物。事实上，从一月一日起，南越全部进口货的百分之八十左右的代价是由美国经济援助来偿付的。”就这样，在“援助”的幌子下，美国剩余商品充斥了南越的每个角落，排挤本地的工商业，也排挤法国的进口货。南越的“钟声报”抱怨说：虽然南越本地出产烟草，南越的河流充满着鱼类，但南越仍在进口美国烟草和罐头鱼。法国资本家们也对此大感不安，巴黎“费加罗报”说：这种措施“严重地损害法国和西贡之间的贸易”，并将“使法国失去除了阿尔及利亚之外的最好的主顾”。巴黎“世界报”预料，一九五五年法郎区输入印度支那的货物将不会超过二百五十亿法郎，而在一九五三年是一千一百四十亿法郎。“世界报”驻西贡记者心酸地说：“法国的工商业者没有多大希望能维持他们在南越的地位了。”
    美国资本渗入南越，早就开始了。在南越从事开采战略原料的公司绝大多数都直接地或间接地同美国资本有联系。现在，美国垄断资本利用美国在南越的控制，更加大规模地取代法国资本的地位。据伦敦“观察家报”报道，美国人“正在通过南越政府购买重要的工业企业……与此相反，大多数法国人则急忙把他们的财产卖出去。”据西贡报纸消息，从前握有印度支那全境专卖权的法国“印度支那酿酒公司”以及西贡的“夏尔纳百货公司”等已经卖给了美国人。
    是的，美国不仅在贸易上打击法国的利益，而且把南越的货币发行权和金融管理权抓到自己的手中。去年十一月间巴黎“回声报”透露，南越的若干社团和美国的一些银行已经举行谈判，研究在南越成立一个由美国垄断资本控制的私营钞票发行机构。今年一月，美国迫使法国把过去法国银行所拥有的货币发行权和金融活动管理权交给了美国控制的南越银行。这样就大大便利了美国垄断资本发展它在南越的势力，进一步排挤法国经济势力。
    美国在南越得寸进尺地排挤法国，不能不引起法国资产阶级极大的恐慌和不满。法国“战斗报”就激愤地写道：“排挤我们的不是对方（指越南民主共和国），而是我们的盟友（指美国）！”三月二十日，法国同南越签订了一项经济协定，规定了相互的关税特惠权和扩大某些种类货物的输入数额。这是法国保护它在南越的市场的一次挣扎。法国也企图利用南越各教派和吴庭艳的矛盾，把吴庭艳赶下台，把保大送回南越，来维护它的阵地。美国国际新闻社曾经报道法国的这种打算说：“法国殖民企业公司据估计拥有南越百分之八十的财富，它们希望保持这笔财富。法国公司认为如果保大继续当权，他们就能够继续保持下去。”可是，这却引起了美国和吴庭艳集团更猛烈的打击。美国公开支持吴庭艳以武力来镇压各教派势力，挑起南越内战，并策动“废黜”保大，同时对法国加施巨大的压力，要法国接受美国在南越的安排。最近美法会谈的结果，法国政府在美国压力下再一次屈服，同意支持吴庭艳傀儡总理。但是美法两国殖民者的根本矛盾并未就此解决。它们钩心斗角的倾轧仍在继续发展。
    南越的局势表明，美国的干涉政策不仅危害印度支那的和平、威胁南越居民的安全，而且也正在猛烈地排挤法国，取代法国而把南越完全变成美国的殖民地。法国统治集团追随美国破坏日内瓦协议，对美国采取步步投降的政策，到头来将会发现，他们是在搬起石头打自己的脚。
