　  Hungary Publishes Communiqué on the Results of the Five-Year Plan Implementation

    The Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics published a communiqué on the results of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan (1950-1954) for the development of the national economy.

    The communiqué pointed out that during this period, Hungary achieved great successes in all aspects of the national economy.

    During the five years, the proportion of industry in the national income increased from 50 percent to 64 percent. The proportion of heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry, increased with the needs of socialist industrialization.

    Today, industry, construction, transportation, foreign trade, and wholesale commerce are completely socialist economies.

    31.2 billion forints were invested in industry in basic investments, accounting for 46.7 percent of total investment, of which 27.3 billion forints were invested in heavy industry.

    Due to the development of socialist competition and the use of advanced labor methods, labor productivity in industry has increased by 46.6 percent.

    In agriculture, 9.2 billion forints were invested, accounting for 13.8 percent of total investment. Agriculture received 13,200 tractors, 2,200 combine harvesters, and many other agricultural machines and tools. By the end of last year, there were 494 state farms and 4,381 agricultural production cooperatives in the country.

    With the development of production, people's welfare has also improved. Unemployment has been eliminated, and the number of workers has increased by 400,000.

    Last year's real wages were 20 percent higher than in 1949. The real income of farmers has increased even further. Social services for residents have also been greatly improved.

    Hungary's population increased by 460,000, and by the end of 1954, the total population had reached 9,750,000.

　  匈牙利发表五年计划执行结果公报
    匈牙利中央统计局发表了关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划（一九五○年—一九五四年）执行结果的公报。
    公报指出，在这段时期内，匈牙利在国民经济各方面获得了巨大成就。
    在五年期间，工业在国民收入中所占的比重从百分之五十增加到百分之六十四。重工业，特别是机器制造业的比重随着社会主义工业化的需要而增加了。
    今天，工业、建筑业、交通运输业、对外贸易和批发商业完全是社会主义经济了。
    基本投资中投入工业的有三百一十二亿福林，占全部投资的百分之四十六点七，其中有二百七十三亿福林投入重工业。
    由于社会主义竞赛的开展和先进劳动方法的使用，工业中的劳动生产率已经提高了百分之四十六点六。
    在农业方面，投入农业的资金有九十二亿福林，占全部投资的百分之十三点八。农业得到了一万三千二百台拖拉机，两千二百台收割机和许多其他的农业机器和农具。到去年年底，国内有四百九十四个国营农场和四千三百八十一个农业生产合作社。
    随着生产的发展，人民福利也提高了。失业现象已经消除，工人人数增加了四十万人。
    去年的实际工资比一九四九年高百分之二十。农民们的实际收入更进一步增加了。对居民的社会服务事业也大大改善了。
    匈牙利的人口增加了四十六万人，到一九五四年底，人口总数已达九百七十五万人。
