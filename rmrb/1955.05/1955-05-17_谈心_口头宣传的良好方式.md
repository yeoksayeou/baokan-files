　　Heart-to-Heart Talks: A Good Way for Oral Propaganda
　　Li Jialing
　　There are many forms and methods of propaganda work. Among them, the heart-to-heart talk, which is a type of oral propaganda, is a propaganda method that is most likely to penetrate people's hearts and has the most practical effect.
　　In the past few years, propaganda workers in many factories and mines have achieved remarkable results in using heart-to-heart talks to educate workers and the masses, publicize the Party's policies, and mobilize the masses to complete the various political and economic tasks proposed by the Party. Many factories and mines are still continuing to widely use heart-to-heart talks to conduct propaganda to workers and the masses, encouraging everyone to overcome difficulties, work hard to learn technology, and actively complete and overfulfill the national plan, so as to build a socialist society as soon as possible.
　　Heart-to-heart talks – this propaganda method has many advantages. It can use spare time such as breaks, going to and from work, and before and after meals to carry out propaganda, without being restricted by time or conditions, thus solving the difficulty that some factories and mines lack time to carry out propaganda work; it can also give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of each propaganda worker, making propaganda work more lively, specific and in-depth; it is convenient to absorb more masses to do propaganda work, preventing the shortcomings of propaganda work staying on a few people or being limited to the propaganda department alone. When Lenin talked about agitators conducting systematic talks among the working people, he said: "Fewer meetings and mass rallies are needed, personal agitation is needed. ... Every conscious male and female worker should use every spare day and hour to do personal agitation." (Lenin, "Speech on the Struggle with Kolchak at the Meeting of Factory Committees and Trade Union Representatives in Moscow on April 17, 1919").
　　However, such a powerful propaganda method as heart-to-heart talks is often neglected by the Party organizations of factories and mines, who believe that: "Heart-to-heart talks do not count as propaganda." The Party organization of Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 praised the propaganda workers responsible for writing blackboards, compiling quick reports, and drawing cartoons, and selected model propaganda workers from them; however, it did not praise the oral propaganda workers, who accounted for two-thirds of the plant's propaganda workers, let alone cultivate or elect model propaganda workers from them. Zhang Hanqing, an outstanding propaganda worker at Fushun Longfeng Mine who used heart-to-heart talks for propaganda, was considered a "propaganda worker with a low level of education" who "often does not work." Zhang Hanqing is indeed not a propaganda worker who can sing, dance, write, and draw, but he relies on his own personal experience of working in the coal mine for more than 30 years, and often uses flexible and clever heart-to-heart talks to conduct propaganda to the masses around him. For example, during the "Safety Campaign Month" in Longfeng Mine in 1954, although the leaders repeatedly emphasized that operating procedures must be observed, many workers in the coal mining team led by Zhang Hanqing believed that the operating procedures were a set of rules compiled by the people above, and were of little use, so they were unwilling to comply. Based on this ideological situation, Zhang Hanqing often adopted a heart-to-heart approach like telling stories to talk about his personal experiences in safe production. For example, he said:
　　"When the Japanese devils occupied Longfeng Mine, they never cared about the safety of the workers. When they saw that the roof was about to collapse, the devils still drove them in with whips. But now, the mine is our own, and the Party and Chairman Mao lead us to build socialism and care about our safety, and formulate operating procedures for us. The operating procedures are not compiled arbitrarily, but are formulated based on many years of experience and bloody lessons. I have suffered countless hardships before I realized that accidents can only be avoided by strictly following the operating procedures." Zhang Hanqing is also good at using concrete examples to explain to workers the harm of not following operating procedures. He said: "Just like the Hui Fengtong accident that happened last year, the operating procedures clearly stipulate that 'knocking on the sides and asking about the top' must be done after arriving at the work face, but Hui Fengtong was careless and did not follow the operating procedures, resulting in an accident." Zhang Hanqing not only often uses the comparison between the past and present safety production situations and some practical lessons to conduct safety production propaganda to the workers, but also actively helps the workers improve their skills and inspects the workers' implementation of operating procedures. Therefore, in 1954, no major accidents occurred in the group he led, and the production tasks were completed ahead of schedule. Facts have proved that the oral propaganda conducted by Comrade Zhang Hanqing is very effective. How can it be said that he is an ineffective propaganda worker? For example, the newly arrived new workers have not yet established a relationship with the mine and are not at ease with production. Zhang Hanqing used his rest time to chat with the new workers and tell them about his experiences. He said: "I have been a 'coal black' for decades, and I only got a good piece of clothing to wear after liberation. How can I not love the mine? Last year, I brought my nephew and grandson to the mine, and my youngest son is only ten years old. When he grows up, I also plan to bring him to the mine and let my descendants live in the mine from generation to generation...." He used the fact that he loved the mine to conduct propaganda and education on loving the mine to the new workers. These kind talks gave the new workers great encouragement, and they gradually settled down.
　　Since Zhang Hanqing is an excellent propaganda worker, why is he considered a "propaganda worker who often does not work"? This is mainly because some Party organizations of factories and mines have long been satisfied with using large and small meetings or large posters and announcements to carry out propaganda work. These propaganda methods have played a great role in mobilizing workers and the masses to complete production tasks, but they cannot be limited to these propaganda methods. Propaganda work itself determines that propaganda methods must be diverse and lively in order to achieve propaganda effects. Some Party organizations do not try to understand the thoughts and demands of workers and the masses, and adopt different methods for propaganda according to different thoughts and demands, but blindly hold large and small meetings and move the tasks assigned by the higher authorities down. Because of this, many Party organizations of factories and mines have abandoned the leadership of propaganda workers engaged in oral propaganda, and have not given them necessary encouragement and training.
　　According to the experience of many factories and mines in adopting the propaganda method of individual heart-to-heart talks, in order to make this work go well, in addition to seriously studying the ideological situation of the masses, determining the content of propaganda in each period, providing propaganda materials to propaganda workers, and specifically leading the activities of propaganda workers, the Party committees of factories and mines must also educate each propaganda worker engaged in oral propaganda to deeply understand the ideological emotions, demands, opinions, and performance of the broad masses of workers in their work and study; propaganda should be carried out according to these thoughts, demands, and opinions. Only in this way can one's own propaganda play a role, and not be considered by others as "irrelevant to me" and "scratching an itch from afar." It is necessary to educate propaganda workers to be good at conducting different propaganda according to different objects. Those workers who perform well in production and work should be praised and encouraged, and those workers who do not perform well in production and work should be appropriately advised and criticized, and helped to correct them; those workers and the masses who have difficult problems should be given patient explanations, and the other party's opinions should be listened to humbly; the questions raised by the workers and the masses must be answered truthfully, and if they cannot be answered themselves, they can ask the higher authorities for answers, and they must not be generalized, vague, empty, or rambling. It is necessary to educate propaganda workers to be sincere in their attitude, clear in their purpose, and truthful in their content when talking heart-to-heart. Every propaganda worker must understand that as long as they earnestly grasp the above-mentioned principles and conduct heart-to-heart talks in a thorough and meticulous manner, they can effectively play a role in correcting mistakes, explaining difficulties, encouraging progress, and promoting work.
　　According to the current characteristics of busy production and tight time in factories and mines, we should make full use of the method of heart-to-heart talks for propaganda. Only in this way can the propaganda work of factories and mines be more active and in-depth.

　　谈心——口头宣传的良好方式
　　李嘉陵
    宣传工作的方式和方法是多种多样的。其中，属于口头宣传之一的谈心，是一种最能深入人心、最有实际效果的宣传方式。
    几年来，许多厂矿的宣传员，在利用谈心这种方式向职工群众进行教育、宣传党的政策、动员群众去完成党所提出的各项政治任务与经济任务中，均获得了显著的成效。现在有许多厂矿，仍然在继续广泛地利用谈心这种方式向职工群众进行宣传，鼓励大家克服困难，努力学习技术，积极完成和超额完成国家计划，以便早日建成社会主义社会。
    谈心——这种宣传方式的优点是很多的。它能利用休息、上下班、饭前饭后等空闲时间去进行宣传，不受时间、条件的限制，从而解决了某些厂矿缺少时间去进行宣传工作的困难；它又能发挥每个宣传员的积极性创造性，把宣传工作搞得更加生动活泼，具体深入；它便利于吸收更多的群众来做宣传工作，防止了宣传工作停留在少数人身上或仅仅局限于宣传部门来做的缺点。列宁在谈到鼓动员在劳动人民中间进行系统的谈话时曾说：“少来些集会和群众大会，需要个人的鼓动。……每个觉悟的男女工人应当利用每一个空闲的日子和钟点去作个人鼓动。”（列宁“一九一九年四月十七日在莫斯科工厂委员会与工会代表会议上关于与高尔察克作斗争的演说”）。
    但是，对谈心这样一种有力的宣传方式，却往往被厂矿党组织所忽视，他们认为：“谈心不算宣传。”抚顺石油一厂的党组织对负责编写黑板报、编快报、画漫画的宣传员都进行了表扬，并从中选出了模范宣传员；但是对占该厂宣传员三分之二的口头宣传员，却没有表扬，更没有从中培养、选举模范宣传员。抚顺龙凤矿出色的用谈心进行宣传的宣传员张汉卿，被认为是“文化水平低”“经常不起作用的宣传员”。张汉卿的确不是一个能歌善舞、能写能画的宣传员，但是，他却依靠自己三十多年来在煤矿工作中的切身体验，用谈心这种灵活而巧妙的方式，经常向他周围的群众进行宣传。如在一九五四年龙凤矿的“安全运动月中”，虽然领导上一再强调必须遵守操作规程，但在张汉卿领导的采煤小组中有很多工人却认为操作规程是上边人编的一套成规，没有多大用处，就不愿遵守。张汉卿根据这种思想情况，常常采取像讲故事一样的谈心的方式，讲述他对安全生产的亲身体验。例如他说：
  “在日本鬼子占领龙凤矿的时候，是从来不管工人的安全的，眼看要冒顶了，鬼子还拿着皮鞭往里赶。而现在呢，矿山是我们自己的了，党和毛主席领导我们建设社会主义，关心我们的安全，为我们制定了操作规程。操作规程不是硬编的，是根据多少年来的经验和血的教训制定的。我吃了无数次的苦头，才使我知道只有严格遵守操作规程，才可以不出事故”。张汉卿又善于用具体例子向工人说明不遵守操作规程的危害。他说：“就像去年发生的惠凤桐事故，操作规程上明明规定，到工作面以后要‘敲帮问顶’，可是惠凤桐却马虎大意，不按照操作规程办事，结果发生了事故。”张汉卿不但经常用过去和现在安全生产情况的对比和一些实际教训，向工人进行安全生产的宣传，而且还积极帮助工人提高技术，检查工人执行操作规程的情况。因此，在一九五四年中，他所领导的那个小组未发生过一次重大事故，并提前完成了生产任务。事实证明，张汉卿同志所进行的口头宣传，作用是很大的。怎么能说他是不起作用的宣传员呢？又如刚来的新工人还没和矿山建立起感情，不安心于生产。张汉卿就利用休息时间去和新工人聊天，给他们讲自己的经历。他说：“我当了几十年的‘煤黑子’，直到解放后才有了一件好衣服穿。我对矿山怎么不热爱呢？去年我把侄儿、孙儿都接到矿上来了，我底小儿子才十岁，大了，我也准备接他到矿上来，让我子子辈辈在矿上生活下去。……”他以自己为什么要热爱矿山的事实向新工人进行热爱矿山的宣传教育。这些亲切的谈话，给了新工人很大的鼓舞，他们也就逐渐安心下来了。
    张汉卿既然是一个出色的宣传员，为什么被人认为是“经常不起作用的宣传员”呢？这主要是因为一些厂矿党组织长期以来，只满足于用大会、小会或用大榜、布告等方式来进行宣传工作。这些宣传方式，在动员职工群众完成生产任务方面是起了很大的作用，但是不能局限于这些宣传方式。宣传工作本身决定了宣传方式必须多样活泼，才能收到宣传效果。有些党组织就因为只满足于这些宣传方式，因而不去设法了解职工群众的思想和要求，根据不同的思想和要求采取不同的方式进行宣传，而是一味召开大会、小会，把上级布置的任务往下搬。正因为如此，许多厂矿的党组织对从事于口头宣传的宣传员放弃了领导，没有对他们进行必要的鼓励和培养。
    根据许多厂矿采用个别谈心这一宣传方式的经验，要使这一工作进行得好，厂矿党委除了要认真研究群众的思想情况，确定每个时期的宣传内容，供给宣传员宣传资料，具体领导宣传员的活动外，还必须教育每个从事于口头宣传的宣传员，要深入了解广大职工群众的思想情绪、要求、意见和在工作学习中的表现；根据这些思想、要求、意见进行宣传。只有这样，才能使自己的宣传发生作用，不致被人认为这些宣传工作“与我无关”，“隔靴搔痒”。必须教育宣传员善于根据不同对象进行不同宣传，对于在生产和工作中表现得好的职工，要给予表扬和鼓励，对于在生产和工作中表现得不好的职工，要适当地进行劝告和批评，并帮助他们进行改正；对有疑难问题的职工群众，要给予耐心的解释，并虚心听取对方的意见；对职工群众所提出来的问题，必须实事求是地给予解答，自己解答不了的，可以请示上级给解答，决不能笼统含混，泛泛无物，茫无边际的乱扯一通。必须教育宣传员谈心时态度要诚恳，目的性要明确，内容要真实。要使每个宣传员都懂得，只要切实地掌握了上述原则，深入细致地进行谈心，就可以有效地起到纠正错误，解释疑难，鼓励进步，推进工作的作用。
    根据目前厂矿生产忙、时间紧这个特点，就应该充分利用谈心这种方式进行宣传，只有这样，才能使厂矿宣传工作更加活跃深入。
