The postal and telecommunications services in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are continuously developing. Postal and telecommunications bureaus have been established successively in the twenty counties of the autonomous prefecture and the Seda area. Before liberation, it took more than a month to send a letter from Kangding to Shiqu County in the northern part of the autonomous prefecture or Batang County in the southern part of the autonomous prefecture, and errors often occurred. Tibetan people often rode horses to deliver letters themselves. Now, postal and telecommunications bureaus can use self-operated postal vehicles, passing through the Kangzang Highway, etc., to transport thousands of mails to Lhasa and various parts of the autonomous prefecture in a timely and accurate manner. At the same time, people of all ethnic groups can use landline telephones from Kangding to talk to Ya'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, and the capital Beijing, and use telegrams to communicate with Lhasa in a few hours.

　　西康藏族自治州发展邮电事业
    西康省藏族自治州的邮电事业不断发展，自治州的二十个县和色达地区已经先后建立了邮电局。解放以前，从康定寄一封信到自治州北部的石渠县或自治州南部的巴塘县，要用一个多月的时间，而且经常发生失错。藏族人民常常骑着马，自己传送信件。现在，邮电局已经能用自办邮车，经过康藏公路等，及时准确地把成千上万的邮件运到拉萨和自治州各地。同时，各族人民可以从康定利用有线电话同雅安、成都、重庆以及首都北京通话，用电报在几小时内同拉萨通讯。
