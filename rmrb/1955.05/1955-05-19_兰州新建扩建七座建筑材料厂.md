　　To supply the construction materials needed for the large-scale industrial and urban construction in Lanzhou, the Lanzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry plans to build and expand seven factories producing construction materials this year. Currently, some projects of the Lanzhou No. 2 Quarry and Lanzhou Sand Quarry have been completed and put into production. In addition, four brick and tile factories and one lime factory are either under construction or undergoing technical design, and it is expected that they can all be handed over for production in the fourth quarter. Most of these factories are located near large enterprise construction sites and along railways, which can utilize local materials and supply locally, thereby reducing transportation costs and lowering project costs. At the same time, some brick and tile factories use machinery for the entire process from brick making to kiln loading, and are equipped with light railways to transport raw materials and finished products back and forth. This can increase production and ensure product quality. After all seven factories are put into production, the output of bricks and tiles will increase by more than 58 percent compared to 1954, and the output of sand will increase by 80 percent.

　　兰州新建扩建七座建筑材料厂
    为了供应兰州市大规模工业建设和城市建设所需要的建筑材料，兰州市工业局计划在今年新建和扩建七个生产建筑材料的工厂。现在，兰州第二采石厂和兰州采砂厂的部分工程已经完工，并投入生产。另外四个砖瓦厂和一个石灰厂，有的正在施工，有的正在进行技术设计，预计在第四季度可以全部移交生产。这些工厂大都分布在大企业建筑工地附近和铁路沿线，可以就地取材、就地供应，因此可以减少运费，降低工程造价。同时，有的砖瓦厂从制坯到装窑，全部使用机械进行，并设有轻便铁道来回运送原料和成品。这样可以提高产量和保证产品质量。七个厂全部投入生产以后，砖瓦将较一九五四年增加百分之五十八多，砂子将增加百分之八十。　（本报驻兰州记者）
