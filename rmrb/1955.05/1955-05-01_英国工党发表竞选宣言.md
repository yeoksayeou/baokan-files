Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th - The British Labour Party issued its election manifesto on the 29th, outlining its stance on foreign and domestic issues.

　　In foreign policy, the manifesto points out that the resolution proposed and passed by the Labour Party in the House of Commons in April 1954, calling for high-level negotiations on the hydrogen bomb issue, has not yet been implemented. The manifesto calls for no further delay in such negotiations.

　　The manifesto states that merely calling for high-level negotiations is not enough; the Prime Minister participating in these negotiations should "insist on a positive policy of peace."

　　The manifesto then elaborates on the objectives of the "Labour Party's peace policy." First, it calls for Britain to fully cooperate in implementing any genuine disarmament plan with effective international supervision. It also points out that an immediate halt to hydrogen bomb testing is the first step. The manifesto continues, stating that another goal is to ease international tensions. It believes that another attempt should now be made to ensure the restoration of German unity through genuine free elections.

　　The manifesto addresses the "crisis in the Far East," particularly the Taiwan issue. As a "solution," the manifesto advocates for "the withdrawal of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from the coastal islands they currently occupy" and for the People's Republic of China to obtain its seat in the United Nations; however, it also advocates for "the neutralization of Taiwan under UN supervision so that the residents of Taiwan can make a choice," even though everyone knows that Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

　　In its manifesto, the Labour Party regards the establishment of the Atlantic bloc, initiated by the former Labour government, as one of its "achievements."

　　When discussing domestic issues, the manifesto blames the Conservative Party for Britain's economic difficulties. It points out that profits are increasing faster than workers' wages, and food prices are also rising. In its manifesto, the Labour Party promises to maintain a stable standard of living, improve housing construction and education, and abolish charges for dentures and eyeglasses.

　　The Labour Party's election manifesto also promises to restore the so-called nationalization of the steel and transportation industries, which was abolished by the Conservative government, and to extend it to other industrial sectors.

　  英国工党发表竞选宣言
    新华社三十日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党二十九日发表竞选宣言，提出工党在外交和内政问题方面的主张。
    在外交政策方面，宣言指出，工党于一九五四年四月在下议院提出并获得通过的要求就氢弹问题举行高级谈判的决议还没有付诸实行。宣言中要求不再拖延这种谈判。
    宣言指出，单是要求举行高级谈判还不够，参加这一谈判的首相还“应该坚持积极的和平政策”。
    宣言接着说明“工党和平政策”的目标。首先，它要求英国通力合作实行任何具有有效的国际监督的真正裁军计划。它还指出立即停止试验氢弹是第一个步骤。宣言接着说，另一个目标就是和缓国际紧张局势。它认为现在应该再一次试图用真正的自由选举的办法来保证恢复德国的统一。
    宣言谈到“远东的危机”，特别是台湾问题。作为解决的“办法”，宣言主张“蒋介石军队撤出它目前所占据的沿海岛屿”，让中华人民共和国得到它在联合国中的席位；但是，它同时又主张“在联合国监督下使台湾中立化，以便使台湾居民可以进行选择”，虽然任何人都知道：台湾从来就是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。
    工党在宣言中把前工党政府倡议建立大西洋集团当作自己的“功劳”之一。
    宣言在谈到内政问题时，就英国的经济困难指责保守党。它指出，利润提高得比职工的工资要快，而且食品价格也在上涨。工党在宣言中答应维持稳定的生活水平，改善住宅建筑和教育的状况，取消装假牙和配眼镜的费用。
    工党的竞选宣言还答应恢复被保守党政府取消了的炼钢业和交通运输业的所谓国有化，并把它扩大到其他一些工业部门。
