General Shvetsov delivered a farewell speech at the reception. He said, "Today we gather together to bid you farewell like brothers." General Shvetsov, on behalf of all Soviet officers and soldiers stationed in Lushunkou, expressed his gratitude to the workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life in Lüda City. He said that the people of Lüda had given meticulous care to Soviet soldiers and their families over the past ten years, and the profound love of the Soviet people for their sincere friends—the Chinese people—could not be expressed in words.

Let the great friendship and fighting unity between our two countries be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee Guo Shushen also spoke at the meeting. He said that the glorious work completed by the Soviet army here and the noble communist spirit demonstrated will forever remain in the minds of the Chinese people. For the sake of lasting peace and the cause of human progress, our two peoples and two armies will stand shoulder to shoulder like brothers, taking on our sacred, common, and glorious tasks.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the leaders of the parties and governments of the Soviet Union and China on their good health, and to celebrate the further development of the great and unbreakable friendship between the peoples and armies of the Soviet Union and China.

At the banquet, General Shvetsov presented gifts to comrades Deng Hua, Gan Siqi, and Guo Shushen, among others.
