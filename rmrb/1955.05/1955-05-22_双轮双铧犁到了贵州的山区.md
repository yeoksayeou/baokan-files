Double-Wheel Two-Share Plow Arrives in Mountainous Areas of Guizhou

To the Editor:

　　The peasants in the mountainous areas of Guizhou are excited to see the double-wheel two-share plow.

　　On May 5th, the Guizhou Province Dading County Local State-run Farm invited over one hundred and seventy cadres from all townships in the county, representatives from agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and urban handicrafts to visit a demonstration of the double-wheel two-share plow.

　　Many passing farmers also crowded around.

　　Two large water buffaloes pulled a double-wheel two-share plow straight through the field. The onlookers repeatedly voiced their praises: "Look! It doesn't need anyone to steer, it plows by itself!" "It's really a good piece of equipment!"

　　Many of the representatives and cadres, in order to see it "thoroughly," simply followed behind the plow. Jin Ruchen, a representative from Pingyuan Township in the Third District, looked it over and over, smiling as he said, "The land in our township is all in large clumps, this thing is perfect for it." Luo Yingxuan, the township head and director of the agricultural production cooperative in Changshi Township of the Twelfth District, squatted down and used a wooden stick to measure the depth of the plow, "Seven inches deep!" he said assertively, "One-third of the land in our cooperative is suitable for this kind of plow." Lin Zhanxuan, a representative from Guihua Township in the Third District, was particularly interested in the benefit of the double-wheel two-share plow not needing anyone to steer it to plow steadily, saying, "The old plows we use, when plowing, go east and west, sometimes deep, sometimes shallow. After plowing all day, my arms ache at night, how can it compare to this!"

　　When the demonstration ended, the onlookers approached the double-wheel two-share plow and saw the words "Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory" on the plow beam, and a feeling of gratitude to the worker elder brothers welled up from the depths of their hearts.

　　Under the glow of the setting sun, the onlookers gathered around the double-wheel two-share plow, listening to the comrades from the agricultural technology extension station explain the advantages, construction, and usage of the double-wheel two-share plow. They hoped to widely promote this new type of agricultural tool, which is both labor-saving and plows quickly, deeply, and evenly, to the mountainous areas.

　　双轮双铧犁到了贵州的山区编辑同志：
    贵州山区的农民兴奋地看到了双轮双铧犁。
    五月五日，贵州省大定县地方国营农场邀请了一百七十多个来自全县各乡的干部，农业生产合作社、互助组和城镇手工业的代表，参观双轮双铧犁的表演。
    很多过路的农民也拥过来了。
    两只大水牛拖引着一架双轮双铧犁在田里直奔。参观的人们不时发出赞美的声音：“看！不要人掌，它自己都会犁！”“真是个好器具啦！”
    不少的代表和干部为了看个“过细”，索性跟在犁的后面追赶着。三区平原乡代表金汝臣看了又看，笑着说：“我们乡里的土地尽是大块，最合用这个东西。”十二区长石乡乡长兼农业生产合作社主任罗应轩蹲下了身子，用木棒量了犁的深度，“七吋深！”他肯定地说：“我们社里的土地有三分之一适合用这种犁的。”三区归化乡代表林占轩，对双轮双铧犁不要人掌都能犁得平稳的好处，特别感到兴趣，他说：“我们用的老犁头，犁起来偏东倒西一深一浅的，犁一天下来，晚上手膀子都酸了，那里比得上这个好！”
    表演结束了，参观的人们走近双轮双铧犁的旁边看到犁辕上写着“北京农业机械厂”出品的字样，不由得从内心深处涌上了对工人老大哥的感谢。
    在夕阳余辉的照耀下，参观的人们围着双轮双铧犁倾听着农业技术推广站的同志讲解双轮双铧犁的好处、构造和使用方法。他们希望把这种既省力、又犁得快、犁得深、犁得平的新式农具，普遍推广到山区去。　邹兴政
