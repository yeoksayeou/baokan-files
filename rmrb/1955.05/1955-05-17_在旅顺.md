　　In Lushun
　　By our reporter Lin Gang
　　The remaining veins of Changbai Mountain embrace the bay tightly like two arms, forming a natural military harbor. The sun shines on the port's buildings. Soviet soldiers faithfully carry out their duty of defending peace in the Far East. Peaceful people are working, fishing boats dot the sea, and thick smoke covers the sky above the factories. On the city streets, Chinese and Soviet people, the People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army, walk by, greeting each other and exchanging salutes. This is Lushun.
　　Lushun is not just an ordinary geographical name. It is a city of friendship. Here, Sino-Soviet friendship is life itself. Stories of friendship abound everywhere.
　　This city on the border of the motherland is tranquil yet full of vitality. Whether in the new or old city area, there are smooth asphalt roads, and beautiful buildings are built along the mountains. Movie theaters are filled with Chinese and Soviet audiences. Soviet soldiers, far from their homeland, can see the latest Soviet films almost at the same time as residents of Moscow. In early April, the color film "Romeo and Juliet," starring Ulanova, was shown here. On the sports field, Chinese and Soviet teams often hold friendly matches, attracting thousands of sports performance enthusiasts. The park at the foot of Baiyu Mountain is named "Friendship," and Chinese workers, Soviet officers, and their wives and children enjoy their holidays together. On weekend evenings, Chinese and Soviet young men and women, with accordions in hand, come to clubs and cultural centers to participate in dances or social gatherings. Art workers from all over China come every year to perform for the Soviet army, either in the luxurious "Soviet Army House" or on the decks of warships. The Soviet army's song and dance troupe also often goes to factories to socialize with Chinese workers.
　　In daily life, the people of Lushun call the Soviet soldiers "Big Brothers" and the Soviet military dependents "Big Sisters"; the Soviet soldiers call older Chinese people "Papa" and "Mama," and ordinary staff members "Comrade." These titles are full of respect and affection, and sound kind and natural. As you stroll down the street, you will find many windows adorned with flowers and embroidered curtains, which are the homes of Soviet soldiers. In Lushun, Chinese and Soviet people live together, either in the same courtyard, or upstairs and downstairs, or next door. Neighbors are as close as family. When officer couples have to go out, they entrust their children and keys to their Chinese neighbors with peace of mind. Soviet people love to eat dumplings, and when Chinese housewives make dumplings, they always bring a few bowls over. Soviet Big Brothers and Big Sisters also often invite their Chinese neighbors to taste new flavors brought from Moscow or Vladivostok. If anyone moves away, they will be missed for a long time. Those who return to their country exchange letters; those who move nearby make time to visit their old neighbors. I once went to a dinner party at the home of his Soviet neighbor with the Party Secretary of a district. The host was a colonel, and the hostess worked as a nurse on the German-Soviet front during the Great Patriotic War. On the table was a photo of her in uniform, and her image reminded one of the character in Panova's novel "Fellow Travelers." They told me: The sincerity and hospitality of the Chinese have made all Soviet soldiers and their families who have come to the Lushun area feel at home.
　　Besides neighbors, the state-owned stores have close ties with the Soviet army. The department store outlets have a wide variety of high-end goods, and the cooperative's vegetable stalls are filled with potatoes, cabbage, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers... that Soviet people love. In order to better serve the Soviet soldiers who cannot often go out, the department store has "booths" near the barracks. The shop assistants are kind and generally can speak some commercial terms in Russian. They often learn about the needs of Soviet customers at the counter, and if customers buy too many things to carry, the shop assistants help them deliver them home. The Soviet army gave these shop assistants who served them so meticulously many Soviet names, and affectionately called the state-owned stores "Mao Zedong's Markin" (meaning: Mao Zedong's store). The state-owned commercial workers said: Guaranteeing to meet the needs of the Soviet army is our concrete task in assisting the Soviet army to consolidate the naval base.
　　Most touching is the friendship of the children. The children do their homework together and play together. Many Chinese children have become excellent students with the help of their Soviet friends. Every summer, the seaside, Baiyu Mountain, parks, and movie theaters are filled with the traces of "close friends."
　　When I came into contact with some young workers and students, I felt everywhere that they had the same enthusiasm, boldness, cheerfulness and sense of humor as the Soviet people. Most of the young people here have Soviet friends. The communist moral qualities of the Soviet people, their will to faithfully defend the cause of peace, and their intense and happy military life have given the youth of Lushun a profound influence and education. This influence can also be seen in daily life. It is a Soviet custom to paint and clean houses before the October Revolution Day and May Day, and now many residents of Lushun also clean their houses before National Day and May Day.
　　The most widely circulated story of friendship is about "treating the sick and saving lives." The Lushun Soviet Army Hospital often accepts Chinese patients. Whenever a patient's condition is serious enough to take their life, their family will think of sending the patient to the Soviet Army Hospital. Many people bring dying patients with hope, and take the healed ones back with endless gratitude. The treatment, hospitalization, and medication of Chinese patients are all free. In the vast rural areas and fishing villages, hundreds of medical workers from Soviet army units treat various diseases for the residents of the station without hesitation.
　　Soviet medical experts are often invited by hospitals, sanatoriums, and war injury hospitals in the Lüda area to consult, solve difficult problems, and perform the most complex operations. Lushun Hospital can be said to be a product of Sino-Soviet friendship. Not long after the liberation of Lushun, a Soviet medical officer organized the local medical workers and allocated some medicines and equipment, and Lushun thus had the first hospital of its own people. The hospital's current equipment, from various medical equipment, operating rooms, laboratories, beds to the patient's coats, leather slippers, cotton wool, and disinfectant, are almost all given free of charge by the Soviet army over the years. Nine Soviet experts are here all year round to treat Chinese residents. The dean told me that the young Chinese medical workers have learned from them not only technology, but more importantly, the socialist medical ideology of "everything for the patient."
　　Cao Shanying, an employee of the Lushun No. 1 Canteen, developed stomach problems in May 1953. His condition was critical and he was sent to the Soviet Army Hospital. The diagnosis was "perforated gastric ulcer." There were perforations in the anterior and posterior walls of the pylorus, and the intense pain caused the patient to fall into a state of delirium. The director of surgery at the hospital, A. N. Bienbiev, personally performed two operations on the Chinese patient. Due to long-term continuous bleeding, the patient was extremely weak and kept going into shock. Before and after the operation, he received three blood transfusions, totaling 3,500 cc. The blood donors were three Soviet soldiers and five Soviet women. Their names are: Zhuravleva, Tretyakov, Felitova, Rastovchiva, Rybak, Protpopova, Talmayeva, and Chubinko. Top-notch medical technology and the blood of friendship saved the life of this young worker from near death. Now, Cao Shanying looks as strong as a healthy person. He has forgotten the pain of his long-term stomach problems, but he will never forget the names of these Soviet citizens.
　　It is impossible to know how many illnesses the Soviet army has cured and how many people it has saved for the Chinese people in the past ten years. It is also unnecessary to count such numbers. No number can express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The revolutionary humanitarian spirit of "rescuing the dying and healing the wounded" of the Soviet army medical workers has been indelibly engraved in the hearts of thousands of workers, peasants and fishermen.
　　What cannot be fully written is the feeling of reluctance to part between the Chinese people and the Soviet army after the publication of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué. In the days before the farewell, countless large-scale or small-scale get-togethers and farewell parties were held continuously from the city to the countryside. People came up with all sorts of ways to express their feelings. The workers made exquisite machine or product models, the farmers gave the Soviet army seeds of abundant crops, the girls embroidered various items with thousands of stitches, and the old ladies found the pillows they had treasured since their wedding from the wooden boxes and gave them to the Soviet army. Soviet naval soldiers picked up a few beautiful pebbles on the beach, carried them in their arms, and took them back to their country as souvenirs. The officers who were packing their luggage looked at the photos they had taken with their Chinese friends again and again, and then carefully stored them in their luggage. The scene of farewell at the station was even more touching. The platform, no matter how big, could not hold the ever-increasing number of people seeing them off. Flowers filled the chest of the general who delivered the farewell speech; colorful pieces of paper covered the Soviet soldiers' uniforms. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army were shaking hands tightly, Chinese and Soviet women hugged and kissed each other again and again, and some could not help but burst into tears, and the Chinese and Soviet Young Pioneers were exchanging red scarves. When the whistle sounded and the train slowly started, the eyes of those who waved goodbye were moist. This scene is reminiscent of a photograph taken ten years ago. That was the day the Soviet army liberated Lüda. Men and women, old and young, filled the streets, welcoming their liberators with tears in their eyes, and young people climbed onto tanks to hug the Soviet soldiers covered in dust. Whether it was the celebration of liberation ten years ago or today's reluctance to part, the emotion is the same, that is, a heartfelt love and gratitude for the Soviet army.

　　在旅顺
　　本报记者　林钢
    长白山的余脉，像两只手臂，紧紧地拥抱着海湾，形成了一座天然的军事良港。太阳照耀着港口的建筑物。苏联军人忠诚地执行着保卫远东和平的职责。和平的人们在劳动，海面渔帆片片，工厂上空浓烟蔽天。市内的街道上，走着中国人和苏联人，解放军和苏军，见了面，互相打招呼，互致敬礼。这就是旅顺。
    旅顺不是一个普通的地理名字。它是一座友谊的城市。中苏友谊在这里，就是生活本身。友谊故事到处流传。
    祖国边疆的这座城市，宁静而又充满生气。不论新市区或旧市区，都有平整的柏油马路，一幢幢漂亮的建筑物依山而筑。电影院里挤满了中苏观众。远离祖国的苏军，可以和莫斯科居民差不多同时看到最新出品的苏联电影。四月上旬，这儿就上映了乌兰诺娃主演的彩色影片“罗密欧与朱丽叶”。运动场上，中苏球队经常举行友谊比赛，吸引着成千上万个球赛表演的爱好者。白玉山麓的公园以
  “友谊”命名，中国工人、苏联军官和他们的妻子、孩子在一起愉快地度过假日。周末的晚上，中苏青年男女，拉着手风琴，唱着歌，一起来到俱乐部、文化馆，参加舞会或联欢晚会。中国各地的艺术工作者，每年都来为苏军作慰问演出，或在豪华的“苏军之家”，或在舰艇的甲板上。苏军的部队歌舞团也常到工厂和中国工人联欢。
    在日常生活中，旅顺人民称苏军为“大哥”，称苏军家属为“大嫂”；苏军称年老的中国人为
  “爸爸”“妈妈”，称一般工作人员为“同志”。这种称呼，饱含着敬爱的感情，听起来亲切而自然。你在街上散步，发现许多窗口摆着鲜花，装饰着挑花窗帘，那就是苏联军人的家庭。旅顺市内，中国人和苏联人住在一起，或为同院，或住楼上楼下，或毗邻而居。邻居之间，亲如家人。军官夫妇有事出门，他们放心地把孩子、钥匙交托给中国邻居。苏联人爱吃饺子，中国主妇包了饺子，总要端几碗过去。苏联大哥大嫂也常把中国邻居请去尝尝新从莫斯科或海参威带来的口味。谁要是搬走了，就会长久想念。回国去的，有书信往还；搬在近处的，得闲就要来看望老街坊。我曾和一区区委书记赴他的苏联邻居的家庭宴会。主人是位上校，女主人卫国战争期间在德苏前线做护士工作，桌上放着她的穿着军装的照片，那形象令人想起潘诺娃小说“旅伴”中的人物。他们对我说：中国人的真挚和好客，让所有来到旅顺口地区的苏联军人和家属消失了异国之感。
    除了邻居，同苏军有着密切联系的是国营商店。百货公司门市部备有品种繁多的高级商品，合作社的菜摊上，摆满了苏联人喜爱的土豆、大头菜、洋葱、西红柿、黄瓜……。为了更好地为不能经常外出的苏军士兵服务，百货公司在兵营附近设有“摊亭”。商店的营业员态度和蔼，一般都能用俄语说一些商业用语。他们在柜上经常了解苏联顾客的需要，顾客买东西多了，拿不了，营业员帮他们送回家去。苏军给这些无微不至地为他们服务的营业员取了许多苏联名字，亲切地称呼国营商店为“毛泽东的玛克金”（意思是：毛泽东的商店）。国营商业工作者们说：保证满足苏军的需要，是我们协助苏军巩固海军根据地的具体任务。
    最为动人的是孩子们的友谊。小朋友们在一起做功课，一起玩。许多中国孩子在苏联小朋友的帮助下，成了优秀学生。每到夏天，海滨、白玉山、公园、电影院到处都可以见到“亲密朋友”的踪迹。
    我和一些青年工人和学生接触，处处感到他们具有苏联人那样的热情、豪爽、明朗和幽默感。这里的青年人大半都交有苏联朋友。苏维埃人的共产主义道德品质，他们忠实地捍卫和平事业的意志，紧张愉快的军中生活，给了旅顺青年深刻的影响和教育。这种影响在日常生活中也可以看到。苏联人的习惯，每年十月革命节和五一劳动节前粉刷和清扫房屋，现在旅顺许多居民也在国庆节和五一节前清扫房屋了。
    流传得最广泛的友谊故事，是关于“治病救人”的。旅顺苏军医院经常接受中国病人。凡是病势严重到足以夺去生命，他的家人便会想到把病人送到苏军医院。多少人怀着希望把垂危的病人送来，又怀着无限感谢的心情把愈者接回去。中国病人的治疗、住院、用药全部是免费的。在广大农村和渔村，成千上百名苏军部队的医务工作者有求必应地为驻地居民治疗各种疾病。
    苏军医学专家经常被旅大地区的医院、疗养院、战伤医院请去会诊、解决疑难问题、施行各种最复杂的手术。旅顺医院可以说是中苏友谊的产物。旅顺解放不久，一位苏军医官把当地的医务工作者组织起来，拨给了一部分药品和器械，旅顺于是有了第一个人民自己的医院。医院现有设备，从各种医疗器械、手术室、化验室、病床直至病人用的大衣、皮拖鞋、药棉、消毒药水，几乎全是苏军几年来无偿赠给的。九位苏联专家常年在这里为中国居民治病。院长告诉我，年青的中国医务工作者向他们学习到的，不仅是技术，更重要的是“一切为了病人”的社会主义医疗思想。
    旅顺第一食堂职工曹善英，一九五三年五月发了胃病，病势危急，被送到了苏联陆军医院，诊断的结果是“胃溃疡穿孔”，胃前壁和后壁的幽门都有穿孔，剧烈的疼痛使得病人陷入了神志昏迷的状态。医院的外科主任阿连恩比叶夫亲自给这位中国病人施行两次手术。由于长时间的连续的渗血，病人极度衰弱，不断发生休克现象。手术前后，输了三次血，总量三千五百西西。输血者是三位苏维埃士兵和五位苏联妇女。他们的名字是：茹拉芙连娃、特烈申科、费利托娃、拉斯托夫契娃、雷巴克、普罗特波波娃、塔尔马叶娃、秋宾柯。头等的医疗技术和友谊的鲜血、从垂危中拯救了这位青年工人的性命。如今，曹善英看起来和健康的人一样结实，他已经忘记了长期胃病的痛苦，但是他终身忘不了这些苏联公民的名字。
    无法知道，十年来，苏军为中国人民治愈了多少病，救活了多少人。统计这样的数字也是不必要的。任何数字都表达不了中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。苏军医务工作者“救死扶伤”的革命人道主义精神，已经永不磨灭地铭刻在千万个工人、农民和渔民的心上。
    写不尽的是，中苏会谈公报发表以后，中国人民和苏军间的惜别之情。在离别前的日子里，从城市到乡村，连续不断地举行了无数次的大规模或小型的联欢会、欢送会。人们想出种种办法来表达自己的心意。工人们制作了精美的机器或产品模型、农民把丰产的种籽送给苏军，姑娘们千针万线刺绣着各种物品，老太太从木箱里找出了结婚时珍藏到现在的枕头送给苏军。苏联海军战士在海滨捡起几块美丽的鹅卵石，揣在怀里，带回国去留作纪念。整理行装的军官们，把他和中国朋友合摄的照片看了又看，然后小心地收藏在行囊里。车站欢送的场面更是感人。月台再大也盛不下愈来愈多的送行的人。鲜花塞满了致告别辞的将军的胸怀；五彩缤纷的纸片沾满苏军战士的戎装。解放军和苏军战士在紧紧地握手，中苏妇女们一次又一次地拥抱、亲吻，有的忍不住热泪横流，中苏少先队员们在交换红领巾。当汽笛一声长鸣，列车缓缓开动时，挥手送别者的眼睛都湿润了。这情景令人想起十年前拍摄的一张照片。那是苏军解放旅大的那一天，塞满街道的男女老幼含泪欢迎自己的解放者，青年人爬上坦克去拥抱满身尘土的苏军战士。无论是十年前的欢庆解放，还是今天的惜别，这感情是共通的，就是对于苏军的出自衷心的热爱和感谢。
