Xinhua News Agency, Suifenhe, May 29th: Soviet military headquarters personnel withdrawing from the Lushunkou area were given a warm send-off as they left our country at 5:00 AM on May 29th, arriving in the border town of Suifenhe, accompanied by Gan Siqi, representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Yu Guying, Deputy Mayor of Lüda. More than two thousand leading cadres from the Party, government, and military in the Suifenhe area, along with representatives from all sectors of the people, waited at the station in the rain from early morning to bid farewell to the departing Soviet troops.

    The Suifenhe station was decorated with the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, as well as giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Bulganin. Red banners hung on the buildings, reading: "Thank you to the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area for their great contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East!" and "Thank you for the deep friendship of the Soviet army in defeating the Japanese aggressors and helping our people achieve liberation!"

    General Shvetsov, head of the command of the troops stationed in Lushunkou, and other senior commanders disembarked from the special train. The military band played the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China, and General Shvetsov inspected the guard of honor lined up at the station.

    A grand farewell rally was held at the station. At the meeting, Gan Siqi, representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a farewell speech. On behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended sincere respect to the officers and men of the original Lushunkou garrison headed by General Shvetsov, and through them to all the glorious returning officers and men of the original Lushunkou garrison. He said: For the sake of world peace and human happiness, we will always advance shoulder to shoulder with you.

    General Shvetsov then delivered a farewell speech. He said: The ten years of Soviet military presence in China are an example of the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people. Let the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people be passed down from generation to generation.

    As the band played the song "Moscow-Beijing," Zhang Qinglu, Director of the Suifenhe Military and Administrative Committee, and representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Suifenhe area, on behalf of the entire military and civilians of the Suifenhe area, presented the Soviet army with a silk banner, and children presented flowers to the senior Soviet generals.

    After the meeting, a reception was held to bid farewell to the senior Soviet generals and officers, and the Heilongjiang Provincial Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful programs.

    At nine o'clock, the senior Soviet generals and officers boarded the train and left Suifenhe. Before boarding the train, General Shvetsov and others repeatedly embraced the farewell representatives such as Gan Siqi with warmth. As the train departed, people on and off the train waved goodbye to each other continuously.

    On the afternoon of the 28th, the Soviet military headquarters withdrawing from the Lushunkou area arrived in Mudanjiang City. More than 6,000 representatives from all walks of life in the local area bid farewell at the station. The Soviet military headquarters personnel toured the city of Mudanjiang and also attended a reception held by all walks of life in Mudanjiang City.
