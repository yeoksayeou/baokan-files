　　New Methods for Organizing Farmers to Watch Movies

　　During mobile screenings in rural areas, film projection teams face several difficulties due to limitations in manpower and equipment, such as not having established fixed projection stations. These difficulties include organizing audiences, selling tickets, supplying gasoline for generators, transportation, and depositing ticket revenues, which can even affect the completion of screening plans. On the other hand, farmers generally use income from their sideline production of local products to buy movie tickets and often cannot see movies because they cannot sell their local products temporarily.
　　To solve this problem, the Weichang County Film Projection Team in Rehe Province has created a method that combines film projection work with the work of supply and marketing cooperatives. When formulating their monthly projection plan, the projection team arranges the screening locations as much as possible at the locations of district and village supply and marketing cooperatives. After their plan is approved by the county's leading authorities, a joint notice is issued by the County Bureau of Culture and Education and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. By posting film posters and brochures in the supply and marketing cooperatives and through the oral introductions of the cooperative staff, the news of the movie screenings quickly spreads among the masses. The supply and marketing cooperatives also presell movie tickets on behalf of the projection team, which not only avoids overcrowding during temporary ticket sales, but also prevents accidents caused by overcrowding. It also avoids delaying the screening time and affecting the audience's production work. At the same time, due to the close cooperation between the projection team and the supply and marketing cooperative, the amount of gasoline needed by the projection team is pre-listed in the supply plan of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative; transportation is also easier to solve with the help of the cooperative, ensuring that the movie can be screened on time. The ticket revenue of the projection team can also be transferred to the county seat in a timely manner through the district and village supply and marketing cooperatives, so that state funds are not accumulated in the team. This ensures that the projection team's work plan is better guaranteed, and the work and study of the projection team members can also be carried out more regularly. In order to facilitate farmers' sale of local products or purchase of necessities, district and village supply and marketing cooperatives also work as usual during movie screenings, which strengthens the connection between farmers and supply and marketing cooperatives, increases the sales volume of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and also prevents private merchants from exploiting farmers during this opportunity. This is indeed a method that deserves attention.
　　How to effectively mobilize and organize rural audiences, provide them with the convenience of watching movies, and enable the broad masses of farmers to see movies and receive education is a major issue in film projection work. The experience of the Weichang County Film Projection Team and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rehe Province in cooperating with each other to carry out work has a positive effect on the further development of projection work. Rural film projection teams in various places should, according to the specific conditions of their localities, draw on the experience of the Weichang County Projection Team and create various methods for mobilizing and organizing rural audiences. This is an important part of film projection work.

　　组织农民看电影的新办法
　　朱树兰
    电影放映队在农村的流动放映中，由于人力和器材等条件的限制，还没有建立起固定的放映站，因而在组织观众、售票、发电机的汽油供应、交通运输、票款的存缴等方面，都碰到一些困难，甚至影响了放映计划的完成。另一方面，农民群众一般都用副业生产的土产品收入买电影票，常因土产品临时卖不出去而看不到电影。
    为了解决这个问题，热河省围场县放映队创造了放映工作同供销合作社工作相结合的办法。放映队在制定每月的放映计划时，将放映地点尽可能安排在区、村供销合作社的所在地。他们的计划得到县的领导机关批准后，由县文教科和县供销合作总社发出联合通知。通过张贴在供销合作社的影片宣传画、说明书和社工作人员的口头介绍，使放映电影的消息很快地在群众中流传开去。供销合作社并代放映队预售电影票，这样不仅能避免临时售票拥挤，甚至因售票拥挤造成事故的现象；而且不会拖延放映时间，影响观众的生产工作。同时，由于放映队和供销合作社的密切配合，放映队需用的汽油量预先列入县供销合作总社的供应计划；交通运输工具也得到社的帮助，比较容易解决，保证电影能够按期放映。放映队的票款收入，也可以通过区、村供销合作社及时转到县城，使国家资金不致被积压在队里。这就使得放映队的工作计划得到较好的保证，放映队员的工作和学习也能较正规地进行。区、村供销合作社为了便利农民出卖土产品或购置必需品，在放映电影的时候也照常工作，这就加强了农民和供销合作社的联系，增加了供销合作社的销购额，还能防止私商利用这一机会对农民进行剥削。这确是一个值得重视的办法。
    如何有效地发动和组织农村的观众，给他们以看电影的方便，使广大农民群众都能看到电影，受到教育，这是电影放映工作中的一个重大问题。热河省围场县放映队和供销合作社互相配合，开展工作的经验，对放映工作的进一步开展，是有积极作用的。各地的农村电影放映队，应该根据当地的具体情况，吸取围场县放映队的经验，创造各种发动和组织农村观众的方法。这是电影放映工作的一个重要环节。
