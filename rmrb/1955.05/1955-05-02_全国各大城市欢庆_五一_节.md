Shanghai City
　　On the 1st, 600,000 people in Shanghai held a parade to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day. At the celebration meeting, Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered a speech. He said: The working people of Shanghai have victoriously completed the plans for the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, creating favorable conditions for our country to gradually transition to a socialist society, and have also made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. He called on everyone to continue to struggle against American aggression and defend world peace. He called on everyone to use their greatest efforts to complete this year's construction plan, carry out the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and transform Shanghai into a strong and prosperous socialist city.
　　The parade was centered on People's Square and was held simultaneously at eighteen locations throughout the city. After the teams of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai and the Young Pioneers passed by, the Shanghai workers' teams followed closely behind. The workers of Shanghai waged a world-renowned heroic struggle against the colonialists in the "May 30th" Movement thirty years ago. Now, holding up banners celebrating the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and congratulating the friendship of Asian and African countries, they pushed models of various new products past the reviewing stand. Among the parading crowd was a huge model of the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine that was recently trial-produced, which is an important new product of Shanghai workers implementing my country's first Five-Year Plan. Textile workers walked into the square with printed cloth and colored silk. Shanghai textile workers saved 3.5 million catties of cotton in 1954. This year, there were more employees of joint state-private enterprises in the parade than in previous years.
　　Teams of farmers, youth, women, and people from all walks of life continued to pour into the square. When a sports performance team of more than 6,000 people formed the two characters "Peace" on the square in neat formations, the crowds inside and outside the venue shouted the loud slogan "Long Live World Peace."

Tianjin City
    More than 100,000 people in Tianjin held a grand parade on the 1st to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day.
    The parade began at 10 a.m. Leading the parade were 3,000 Young Pioneers. Dressed in brightly colored clothes, they waved garlands and marched forward joyfully. Next came a team of 50,000 workers. They held up vivid production charts, product models, and various slogans, showing the new achievements Tianjin workers have made in production and their determination and strength to complete the first Five-Year Plan. On the eve of "May Day," more than 100 state-owned and joint state-private factories in the city had completed their April production plans ahead of schedule in order to greet this great festival. The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, which completed its April production plan ahead of schedule and increased steel production by more than 600 tons, walked at the forefront of the workers' parade. The team of more than 8,000 textile workers attracted people's attention. The female workers were wearing clothes made of various colored fabrics spun and dyed by themselves, and the wide road seemed to be full of beautiful flowers in full bloom. The factories under the Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau produced 15 new varieties and 143 new patterns in the first quarter of this year to supply people's needs. Charts from state-owned textile factories under the Tianjin Textile Administration Bureau showed that they saved enough raw cotton in the first quarter to weave more than 20,000 more bolts of cotton cloth for the country. The ranks of employees in joint state-private enterprises have expanded compared to previous years. They held up charts showing the new atmosphere and new achievements that have emerged after the joint venture, and cheered and moved forward happily.
    Also participating in the parade were teams of suburban farmers, government cadres, women, students, and sports and art workers.

　　400,000 people in Shenyang braved heavy rain on the 1st to hold a grand parade to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day.
　　At 9 a.m., the solemn celebration ceremony began in the singing of the national anthem and the Internationale. Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Song Fenglin, a model worker in Shenyang, both spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Huang Oudong called on the broad masses of working people in Shenyang and Liaoning Province to actively produce, practice strict economy, fully support the liberation of Taiwan, completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and defend peace in Asia and the world.
　　In the parade, the powerful workers' contingent was led by more than 340 model workers, who held up charts and new product models, marking the new achievements made by the working class of Shenyang in building the cause of socialism. Charts held by heavy industrial workers in Shenyang showed that more than 75 percent of the workers had participated in labor competitions and learned 58 kinds of advanced experiences in the past year.

　　Thousands of athletes dressed in various sports clothes marched with vigorous steps, shouting slogans such as "Strengthen your body," "Build the motherland," and "Defend the motherland." Female athletes holding rattan hoops performed various graceful gymnastics in the heavy rain. When the art and literature troupe passed by, the streets immediately cheered.

When workers building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge passed by carrying a model of the Hanshui Highway Bridge and a huge oil painting with the words "We must build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge well," people applauded warmly. These workers who built the bridge had already completed the Hanshui Railway Bridge in 1954, and now the underwater foundation project of the Hanshui Highway Bridge, the bridge site exploration work of the Yangtze River Bridge, and the steel beam design work of the Yangtze River Bridge have also been successfully completed. People watched excitedly the charts carried by the Yangtze River Seamen's workers.

The new workers at the Changshou Longxi River Hydropower Station construction site took a boat from more than 100 miles away on April 30 specifically to participate in the parade. The female train attendants of the No. 51 Chengdu-Chongqing Railway train, which had just arrived in Chongqing from Chengdu on April 30, also participated in the parade on the 1st.

The workers of the carpentry workshop of the Southwest Iron and Steel Company, where Huang Rongchang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a special-class model worker in Chongqing, is located, used waste materials to make an automatic four-sided planing machine before "May Day," which was officially put into production on April 30. On the 1st, they excitedly participated in the parade. The Sichuan River sailors and shipping workers, who are stepping up the transportation of grain to support East China and Central South China, also participated in the parade. The night navigation charts they carried showed their great achievements in conquering the dangerous Sichuan River. Now, they have generally increased the turnover rate of ships on the Sichuan River by 20% to 25%.
    People from all walks of life also participated in the parade. Noteworthy were the teams of children and young students. Holding flowers, holding model airplanes, and pushing models of tower cranes, coal mining combines, etc., they shouted slogans such as: "We are the reserve force for the defense and construction of the motherland" and "Dedicate our youth to the motherland" and marched forward.

Xi'an City
    At dawn on the 1st, the jubilant people of Xi'an began to converge on the streets. At 10 a.m., the celebration of "May Day" International Labor Day began in the city center. Then, 200,000 working people held a parade.

In the first quarter of this year, the employees of 44 larger factories in the city exceeded their planned total output value. The total output value of these factories in the first quarter increased by 58 percent compared with the same period in 1954. Workers at the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory participated in the parade with double-wheeled double-share plows they manufactured themselves. In the first four months of this year, they produced more than 300 more of these new products than the quota, and reduced costs by 12 percent. The employees of the joint state-private Tianxiang Instrument Factory, the first factory in my country capable of producing various measuring instruments in large quantities, participated in the parade with huge colored paintings, which read: "Produce precision instruments to support railway, forest, mine, geological, and water conservancy construction." Now, the large plane tables and theodolites manufactured by the workers of this factory have been transported to the Yellow River and Huai River control construction sites.
    The team of construction workers attracted special attention when they passed by. The charts and models they held told people: From "May Day" 1954 to today, they have built more than 200 factories, schools, hospitals, and theaters; in 1955, they undertook construction tasks that were more than the total of the construction projects since liberation.
    Nearly 10,000 construction workers from East China, Northeast China and other places who came to Xi'an to support construction passed by holding a sign that read "Go to where the motherland needs us." At this time, cheers and applause immediately rang out from the crowd. Among them was Zhu Genfu, an old construction worker who had not left the Shanghai area for forty years. In June 1954, Zhu Genfu resolutely requested to be transferred to work in Xi'an; in just ten months, he created and improved nine kinds of advanced tools, each of which increased production efficiency by more than 50 percent. These workers have been warmly welcomed and respected by the people of Xi'an.
    Also participating in the parade were suburban farmers, government cadres, students, citizens, etc. They shouted slogans such as "Strive to complete the 1955 national construction plan," "Liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique," and "Celebrate the achievements of the Asian-African Conference."
