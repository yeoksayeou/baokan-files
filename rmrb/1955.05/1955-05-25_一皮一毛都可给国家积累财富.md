　　Every Hide and Hair Can Accumulate Wealth for the Country

    In the nationwide labor competition among workers, employees in the animal husbandry sector are also actively accumulating wealth for the country starting from every hide and hair.

    There is a kind of wild animal—the hog badger—whose fur is thick and can be used for fur coats. However, because the fur surface has needle hairs (a kind of thicker and longer hair), the pelt appears somewhat rough, and sales were not very good in the past. Later, the employees of the animal husbandry department came up with a way to pull out the needle hairs, and the pelt became very soft, becoming a popular raw material for suede overcoats, leather hats, and leather collars. The pulled-out needle hairs, after processing, also become a very good raw material for making brushes. If 5,000 pounds of hog badger needle hairs are exported in a year, it can earn the country the equivalent of more than 100,000 yuan in foreign exchange.

    The pelts of incense civets and Jiujiang civets also have needle hairs on their surfaces. In the past, sales were sluggish, but after the needle hairs are pulled out, the original pelts can be made into various colored sheared fur. The textile company of the German Democratic Republic alone ordered 135 overcoats of various colors made of incense civet and Jiujiang civet pelts in one go. There is also a kind of green serow pelt, and removing the needle hairs on it increases the value of the pelt by 20 percent.

    The hair inside the ears of cattle was not noticed in the past. Recently, it has been found to be a high-quality raw material for eyebrow and eyelash makeup brushes. There is not much hair inside the ears of cattle. Generally, the two ears of a cow can only produce three-tenths of a tael of hair, but its value is very high. If 1,000 pounds of cow ear hair is accumulated for export, it can earn the equivalent of more than 20,000 yuan in foreign exchange.

    The hair on the tail of the yellow weasel is also a very valuable raw material for makeup brushes and brush tips. It is very popular in the international market and is also called "Yuan Tail Hair." After processing, every ten pounds of export is equivalent to the value of more than 400 bags of flour.

    These new soft hair products were exhibited at the Leipzig Fair in February this year and have recently been exhibited in the Chinese pavilion at the Lyon International Fair.

    The abundant wild animals and livestock of the motherland, even a single hide or hair, although scattered and fragmented, can accumulate a lot of wealth for the country if they can be gathered and carefully processed and sorted.

　　一皮一毛都可给国家积累财富
　　陈马力
    在全国职工开展劳动竞赛中，畜产部门的职工也积极地从一皮一毛来为国家积累财富。
    有一种野生动物——石獾，它的绒毛丰厚，可作裘衣。但是因为毛面上有毛针（一种较粗较长的毛），就显得皮子有些粗糙，过去销路不太好。后来畜产部门的职工想办法把毛针拔下来，皮子就变得十分细软，成为畅销的反毛大衣和皮帽子、皮领子等原料了。拔下来的毛针，经过加工，也成为很好的制刷原料。如果一年出口五千磅石獾毛针，就能为国家换回相当于十几万元的外汇。
    香狸子皮和九江狸子皮的皮面上也有毛针，过去销路不畅，但是把毛针拔下来后，原来的皮子就可以做成各色剪绒皮。仅德意志民主共和国的纺织公司一次就订购了各种颜色的香狸子皮和九江狸子皮大衣一百三十五件。还有一种青猺子皮，拔去上面的毛针，皮子的价值就提高了百分之二十。
    牛耳朵里面的毛，过去是不被人注意的。最近发现它却是一种上等眉睫化妆刷原料。牛耳朵里面的毛不多，一头牛的两个耳朵一般只能产三分重的毛，但是它的价值却很高，如果积累一千磅牛耳毛出口，就可以换回相当于两万多元的外汇。
    黄狼尾巴上的毛也是一种很珍贵的化妆刷原料和笔料毛，在国际市场上很受欢迎，又称“元尾毛”，经过加工每出口十磅，就相当于四百多袋面粉的价值。
    这些新的软毛产品，今年二月曾在莱比锡博览会展出过，最近又在里昂国际博览会的中国馆中展出。
    祖国丰富的野牲和家畜的一皮一毛，虽然零星分散，但只要能聚集起来，经过精致的加工整理，同样可为国家积累很多财富。
