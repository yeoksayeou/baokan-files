    To Defend Marxism and Oppose Bourgeois Idealist Ideologies
　　Pan Zinian
    Marxism has cast a brilliant light on human history, illuminating the path to the liberation of all mankind. As Lenin said in 1913, every era of the three great historical eras since the advent of Marxism has brought it new confirmation and new victories, but the coming historical era will surely bring even greater victories to Marxism, the doctrine of the proletariat [Note]. Lenin's wise prediction has been fully confirmed by the revolutionary practice of the world proletariat over the past forty years. First, the Russian proletariat won the victory of the great October Revolution in 1917 and established the world's first socialist state. Later, after World War II, some countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe broke away from the capitalist system and established people's democratic systems. In Asia, the Chinese people also won the victory of the people's democratic revolution and established the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union is now carrying out communist construction. China and other people's democratic countries have also embarked on the road of socialist construction. This is the glorious victory of Marxism. And those proletarians and working people who have not yet been freed from enslavement and embarked on the road to freedom and happiness are also fighting unyieldingly for peace and democracy. They are increasingly recognizing from the cruel struggle that Marxism is the only reliable science that can guide them to break away from enslavement and embark on the road to freedom and happiness.
    Over the millennia, social forms have undergone several major changes. However, before the socialist revolution, the changes in social forms never went beyond the scope of class antagonism, only the replacement of one system of exploitation by another. The broad masses of working people were still in a position of being exploited and oppressed. Only the socialist revolution can completely abolish the system of man oppressing man and man exploiting man. The socialist revolution is the proletariat leading all working people to overthrow the capitalist system and carry out revolutionary transformation of society. The replacement of the capitalist system by the socialist system is an inevitable law of human historical development.
    The founders of Marxism—Marx and Engels—systematically studied human history and deeply experienced the workers' movement of the time. They created Marxism, this revolutionary science, on the basis of critically accepting the highest scientific achievements accumulated by mankind in the nineteenth century.
    The three most advanced mainstreams of thought in the nineteenth century were German classical philosophy, British classical economics, and French socialism associated with French general revolutionary doctrines. French socialism reflects the new oppression and exploitation of workers under the capitalist system and opposes such oppression and exploitation. It criticized and denounced the then capitalist, evil social system, but it was only a utopia. It could not point out a real way out to transform this evil society. It would neither elucidate the essence of capitalist wage slavery, nor discover the laws of development of capitalist society, nor find the social forces that could become the creators of a new society. Although the British classical economics of the time laid the foundation for the labor theory of value when examining the economic system, it could only individually see some of the laws of capitalist economic activity, but could not find the general trend and general laws of development of this economic activity. Marx and Engels were the first to use the highest achievements of natural science and other fields at the time, and, from the standpoint of the proletariat, transformed German classical philosophy at the time. In Lenin's words, they "enriched philosophy with the results of the Hegelian system, which gave rise to Feuerbach's materialist philosophy." And the most important of these results is dialectics. But the dialectic of the Hegelian system is idealist and upside down; Marx and Engels, based on the achievements of natural science, turned it right side up, making it materialist dialectics, and used it to transform Feuerbach's old materialist philosophy. In this way, Marx and Engels deepened and developed materialist philosophy, carrying it through to the end, extending its understanding of the natural world to the understanding of human society, creating a scientific, dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview. The three main currents of thought at that time, after being critically transformed by Marx and Engels, became the three components of Marxism: dialectical materialism and historical materialism philosophy, proletarian political economy, and scientific communism. Marx made a very complete and rigorous analysis of capitalist society from the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, enabling the working class and working people of the world to obtain "Das Kapital," such a glorious and great Marxist scientific masterpiece in human thought. With Marx's proletarian political economy, it was possible for socialism to develop from utopia to science.
    The reason why Marxism is correct and omnipotent is because it has scientific political economy as its main pillar and materialist dialectics as its soul.
    From the moment Marxism appeared, the bourgeoisie and its agents have tried all kinds of methods and means to attack Marxism, attempting to eliminate the brilliant light that mankind has already emitted. However, Marxism did not come out of thin air; it is a summary of the revolutionary practice of the world's proletariat and working people, a summary of human history, and a summary of the laws of development of the objective world. It is an objective truth that no one can change. Therefore, as Lenin said: "Every time Marxism is 'eliminated' by official science, it only becomes more consolidated, stronger, and more vigorous." But at the same time, because Marxism's historical mission is to fundamentally transform the entire world and liberate all mankind, its birth and development cannot but always experience an increasingly complex and increasingly acute long journey of class struggle. Lenin made a clear analysis of this point in his article "Marxism and Revisionism":
  In the first half-century of Marxism's existence (from the 1840s), it struggled against theories that were fundamentally opposed to it. In the first half of the forties, Marx and Engels broke with the radical young Hegelians who stood on the viewpoint of idealist philosophy. In the late forties, a struggle against Proudhonism was carried out in economics. In the fifties, this struggle was completed: the parties and doctrines that had emerged in the stormy year of 1848 were criticized. In the sixties, the struggle shifted from general theory to closer to the direct workers' movement: the Bakuninists were expelled from the First International. In the early seventies, the Proudhonist Miebex had a short-lived run in Germany, and in the late seventies, the positivist Dühring temporarily showed his face. But the influence of both of them on the proletariat was very weak. Marxism had unconditionally defeated all other ideological systems in the workers' movement.
    But when Marxism abandoned all doctrines that were somewhat complete and opposed to Marxism, the tendencies expressed by these doctrines began to find other ways out. The second half-century of Marxism's existence (from the 1890s) began with a struggle within Marxism against anti-Marxist factions.
    After the beginning of the twentieth century, this struggle of Marxism (struggle against theories that are fundamentally opposed to it; struggle against some anti-Marxist factions within) did not ease, but became more complex and more acute. Until now, this struggle has never stopped. This struggle is the manifestation of class struggle on the ideological front. If the proletariat and working people of any country want to correctly grasp Marxism so that their revolutionary cause can be victorious under the brilliant light of Marxism, they must adhere to this struggle and must wage a struggle against all kinds of idealist ideas.
    Marxism and its philosophy, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, is a very complete, very rigorous, and very precise ideological system; it cannot tolerate peaceful coexistence with any hostile ideas, any distortions, or any revisionist anti-Marxist factions.
    In the past thirty years, the development of Marxism in China and the continuous victories it has gained in China, just like in other countries, have also been achieved through an increasingly complex and increasingly acute struggle. Before the Chinese working class and working people seized power, the reactionary ruling class used "theories" that were fundamentally opposed to Marxism to attack Marxism. After the Chinese working class and working people seized power, the struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism did not weaken. On the contrary, during the transition period, the struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism on the ideological front is of a more acute nature. We know that during the transition period, class struggle has not eased, but has become more complex and more acute. One of the important methods used by the resolute reactionaries among the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated at home and abroad to sabotage our country's socialist construction is to use bourgeois ideas to oppose Marxist ideas and use the idealist worldview to oppose the materialist worldview. They use this method to hinder social progress, hinder the progress of construction, and corrupt the working people, even corrupt our party. Therefore, defending Marxism against bourgeois idealist ideologies is an important condition for the victory of the socialist revolution. In order to smoothly advance the cause of socialist construction, this struggle must be carried out.
    The struggle in our country's ideological circles, starting in October 1954, against the pragmatist thought of the Hu Shi faction, the anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought of Hu Feng, as well as the struggle in the health field against the idea of ​​underestimating medical heritage, and the struggle against the ideas of revivalism and formalism in civil architecture, is the beginning of this great struggle.
    The second stage of the Chinese people's revolution—the socialist revolution stage—is an extremely extensive and profound revolution that fundamentally transforms our society. Only by establishing a dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview can we correctly understand the laws of natural and social development, and under the leadership of the Party, continuously solve the tasks we face in socialist construction. Armed with dialectical materialism and historical materialism, we can have bright eyes and clear minds, and we will not be frightened by any great difficulties; only in any difficult and difficult environment can we overcome difficulties and move forward by leaps and bounds. This is what Marx said, that once theory grasps the masses, it immediately becomes a material force. Today, on the 137th anniversary of Marx's birth, we must seriously and diligently study Marx's materialism and wage an unyielding struggle against all idealist ideas. Under the guidance of Marxism, the people of our country will surely be able to continuously push the cause of socialist construction forward.
  [Note] In his article "The Historical Destiny of Marxist Doctrine," Lenin divided the period after the advent of Marxist doctrine into three main periods: the first period was from the 1848 Revolution to the Paris Commune (1871); the second period was from the Paris Commune to the Russian Revolution (1905); the third period was from the Russian Revolution of 1905.

    为捍卫马克思主义、反对资产阶级唯心主义思想而斗争
　　潘梓年
    马克思主义给人类历史放出了万丈光芒，照明了解放全人类的道路。列宁在一九一三年曾经这样说过：马克思主义出世以后，全世界历史三大时代中的每一个时代，都使它获得了新的证实和新的胜利，但行将到来的历史时代，定会使马克思主义这个无产阶级学说获得更大的胜利〔注〕。列宁这个英明的预见，已为四十多年来世界无产阶级的革命实践完全证实了。首先是俄国的无产阶级在一九一七年取得伟大十月革命的胜利，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。以后在第二次世界大战后，东欧和东南欧的一些国家挣脱了资本主义体系，建立了人民民主制度。在亚洲，中国人民也取得了人民民主革命的胜利，建立了人民民主的中华人民共和国。苏联现在正进行共产主义建设。中国和其他人民民主国家也踏上了社会主义建设的大道。这是马克思主义的光辉胜利。而那些暂时还没有摆脱奴役走上自由幸福道路的无产阶级和劳动人民，也正在为争取和平、民主而不屈不挠地斗争着。他们从残酷的斗争中越来越认识到马克思主义是能够指导他们摆脱奴役，走上自由幸福道路的唯一可靠的科学。
    几千年来，社会形态已经发生了好几次大的变革。但在社会主义革命以前，社会形态的变革总没有超出阶级对抗的范围，只是一种剥削制度代替另一种剥削制度而已。广大劳动人民仍然处于被剥削被压迫的地位。只有社会主义革命才能彻底废除人压迫人、人剥削人的制度。社会主义革命是无产阶级领导全体劳动人民推翻资本主义制度、对社会实行革命的改造。社会主义制度代替资本主义制度，是人类历史发展的必然规律。
    马克思主义创始人—马克思、恩格斯，系统地研究了人类的历史，深切地体验了当时的工人运动。他们在批判地接受十九世纪人类所积累起来的最高科学成果的基础上，创造了马克思主义这一革命的科学。
    人类在十九世纪的最先进的三个主要思潮，就是德国古典哲学、英国古典经济学以及同法国一般革命学说相联的法国社会主义。法国的社会主义是反映在资本主义制度下对劳动者的新的压迫和剥削并反对这种压迫和剥削的学说。它批评和指斥过当时的资本主义这个罪恶的社会制度，但它还只是一种空想。它对改造这个罪恶社会指不出真正的出路。它既不会阐明资本主义雇佣奴隶制的本质，也不会发现资本主义社会的发展规律，也不会找到能够成为新社会创造者的社会力量。当时英国的古典经济学，虽然在考察经济制度时奠定了劳动价值论的始基，但它只能个别地看出资本主义经济活动的一些规律，却不能找到这种经济活动的总的趋势，总的发展规律。马克思、恩格斯首先就是运用了当时自然科学等方面的最高成就，以无产阶级的立场，改造了当时的德国古典哲学。照列宁的话说，他们是“用那引起了费尔巴黑唯物主义哲学的黑格尔体系底成果把哲学丰富起来了。”而这些成果中最重要的就是辩证法。但黑格尔体系的辩证法是唯心主义的，是首脚倒置的；马克思和恩格斯根据自然科学方面的成果，把它的首脚摆正，成为唯物主义的辩证法，并且用以改造费尔巴哈的旧的唯物主义哲学。这样，马克思、恩格斯就加深并发展了唯物主义哲学，使它贯彻到底，将它对于自然界的认识，推广为对于人类社会的认识，创造了科学的、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观。当时三种主要思潮经过马克思恩格斯批判地改造以后便成为马克思主义的三个组成部分：辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义哲学、无产阶级的政治经济学和科学的共产主义。马克思以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义观点对资本主义社会作出十分完备而严整的分析，使全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民获得了“资本论”这样一部人类思想上最辉煌最伟大的马克思主义科学巨著。有了马克思主义的无产阶级政治经济学，就有可能使社会主义获得从空想到科学的发展。
    马克思主义所以正确、所以万能，就是因为有科学的政治经济学作为它的主要支柱，有唯物辩证法作为它的灵魂。
    从马克思主义一出现之日起，资产阶级及其代理人就想尽各种各样的方法和手段，来向马克思主义进攻，企图把人类已经发出了的万丈光芒消灭掉。但是，马克思主义并不是凭空而降的；它是全世界无产阶级和劳动人民革命实践的总结，是人类历史的总结，是客观世界发展规律的总结。它是任何人所没有办法加以改变的客观真理。因此，如列宁所说：“马克思主义每次被官场科学‘消灭’之后，却反而愈加巩固，愈加坚强，愈加生气勃勃了。”但同时由于马克思主义的历史使命是要根本改造整个世界面貌，解放全人类，因而它的诞生和发展始终不能不经历着愈来愈复杂，愈来愈尖锐的阶级斗争的万里征途。关于这一点，列宁在他“马克思主义与修正主义”一文中，曾经做过明确的分析：
  马克思主义存在的头半世纪中（从十九世纪四十年代起），就和那些根本上与它相敌对的理论进行过斗争。在四十年代前半期，马克思与恩格斯打破了那些站在唯心主义哲学观点上的急进少年黑格尔派。四十年代末，在经济学方面进行过反对蒲鲁东主义的斗争。五十年代完成了这个斗争：批评了那些在狂风暴雨的一八四八年显过身手的党派与学说。在六十年代，斗争从一般理论方面转移到更接近于直接工人运动方面：把巴枯宁派从第一国际里驱逐出去了。在七十年代初期，蒲鲁东主义者米别赫在德国出了一个短时期的风头，而在七十年代末叶，又有实证主义者杜林暂时显露过头角。但他们两人对于无产阶级的影响已是非常微弱了。马克思主义已经是无条件地战胜了工人运动中其他一切思想体系。
    但是当马克思主义把一切多少完整而同马克思主义相敌对的学说抛弃了以后，这些学说所表现的趋向便开始另找出路。马克思主义存在的第二半世纪（从十九世纪九十年代起），是从马克思主义内部展开一个对于反马克思主义派别所进行的斗争开始的。
    二十世纪开始以后，马克思主义的这种斗争（和那些根本上与它相敌对的理论进行斗争；和内部一些反马克思主义派别进行斗争），不是缓和下来，而是更为复杂，更为尖锐了。直到现在为止，这种斗争一直没有间断过。这种斗争是阶级斗争在思想战线上的表现。任何一个国家的无产阶级和劳动人民要正确地掌握马克思主义，使自己的革命事业能在马克思主义光辉的照耀下取得胜利，就必须坚持这种斗争，必须同各式各样的唯心主义思想展开斗争。
    马克思主义及其哲学辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是一个十分完备、十分严整、十分精密的思想体系；它一刻也不能容许同任何敌对思想，任何歪曲，任何修正的反马克思主义派别和平共居。
    近三十多年来，马克思主义在中国的发展，在中国所不断获得的胜利，正和它在其他国家一样，也是经历着愈来愈复杂，愈来愈尖锐的战斗得来的。在中国工人阶级和劳动人民取得政权以前，反动统治阶级就曾用那些根本同马克思主义相敌对的“理论”向马克思主义进攻。当中国的工人阶级和劳动人民取得了政权以后，马克思主义同反马克思主义的斗争也并没有减弱。相反地，过渡时期在思想战线上马克思主义同反马克思主义的斗争是具有更尖锐的性质。我们知道，在过渡时期，阶级斗争不是缓和了，而是更为复杂更为尖锐了。国内外已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反动分子，他们用以破坏我国社会主义建设事业的重要方法之一，就是用资产阶级思想反对马克思主义思想，用唯心主义世界观反对唯物主义世界观。他们用这种方法来阻碍社会的进步，阻碍建设事业的进展，并腐蚀劳动人民，直到腐蚀我们的党。所以，捍卫马克思主义反对资产阶级唯心主义思想是社会主义革命胜利的重要条件。为了顺利推进社会主义建设事业，必须开展这一斗争。
    我国思想界从一九五四年十月开始的对于胡适派实用主义思想、胡风的反马克思主义的文艺思想的斗争，以及卫生事业中对于轻视医学遗产的思想、对于民用建筑方面的复古主义和形式主义的思想的斗争，就是这一巨大的斗争的开始。
    中国人民革命的第二阶段——社会主义革命阶段，是根本改造我国社会的极广泛而深刻的革命。只有确立了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，才能正确地了解自然和社会发展的规律，在党的领导下不断地解决我们在社会主义建设中所面临的任务。以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义为武装，我们就能眼光明亮，头脑清醒，面对任何巨大的困难，不致被它们吓倒；才能在任何艰巨困难的环境中，战胜困难大踏步前进。这就是马克思所说的，理论一掌握了群众，就立即变成物质的力量。在纪念马克思诞辰一百三十七周年的今天，我们必须认真地努力学习马克思主义的唯物主义，同一切唯心主义思想进行不屈不挠的斗争。在马克思主义的指导下，我国人民一定能够把社会主义建设事业不断推向前进。
  〔注〕列宁在“马克思学说底历史命运”一文中把马克思学说出世以后分成了三个主要时期：第一个时期是从一八四八年革命到巴黎公社（一八七一年）；第二个时期是从巴黎公社到俄国革命（一九○五年）；第三个时期是从一九○五年俄国革命时起。
