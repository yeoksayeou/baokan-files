　　Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative Purchases Local Products to Support Spring Planting
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province are actively purchasing local products and waste materials from farmers, providing strong support for spring planting and production. According to incomplete statistics from eleven purchasing stations as of mid-April, more than seventy types of local products and waste materials, including medicinal materials, dried persimmons, scrap copper, and chicken feathers, have been purchased, with a total value of over 17 million yuan. The Yahongqiao grassroots supply and marketing cooperative in Yutian County purchased 110,000 jin of cabbage from the Wang Xixian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaodaozhuang, valued at 1,200 yuan. With this money, the cooperative immediately purchased 2,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, 700 jin of cottonseed cake, two head of cattle, 50 jin of pesticide, and 9,000 jin of cottonseed hulls. The remaining funds were used to repay loans and deposit a portion into the credit cooperative. In Wu'an County, two agricultural production cooperatives and five mutual aid teams in Yonghe Village used the 64 yuan they earned from selling old cotton and scrap iron to immediately purchase 20,000 jin of cotton seeds and repair more than ten cotton seed drills, ensuring that cotton was sown on time.

　　河北供销社收购土产支援春耕
    河北省各地供销合作社积极收购农民的土产和废品，有力地支持了春耕生产。据十一个收购站截至四月中旬的不完全统计，已收购的药材、柿饼、废铜、鸡毛等七十多种土产和废品，总值金额达一千七百多万元。玉田县鸦鸿桥基层供销合作社收购了高道庄王希现农业生产合作社白菜十一万斤，价值一千二百元。这个社得到这笔款，立即购买了化学肥料二千斤，棉仁饼七百斤，耕牛两头，农药五十斤，棉籽皮九千斤。余款除偿还了贷款以外，还存入信用合作社一部分。武安县永和村两个农业生产合作社和五个互助组拿到卖旧棉花、废铁等废品所得的六十四元，当即购买了两万斤棉籽，修理了十多张耩棉花耧，保证了棉花按时播种。
