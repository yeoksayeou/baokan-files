    Strange Competition
    Ding Li
    The Fushun Cement Plant launched a labor competition in the first quarter of this year. Each workshop put forward six major indicators, such as completion of output, cost, and labor productivity, as conditions for the competition.
    However, the state plan for the first quarter was not completed, and the competition conditions in each workshop were not achieved.
    What to do? The leaders of the cement plant thought: If the evaluation is based on the completion of the state plan indicators, no one will win, and the evaluation will not look good, which will affect everyone's "emotions." In order to continue to maintain the "enthusiasm" of the competition, they came up with a way to "choose a general from dwarfs," selecting "advanced" and "winning" units to "promote" everyone's progress.
    Let's take a look at the achievements of these "advanced" and "winning" units!
    The raw material workshop is the "advanced" workshop in the competition. Its achievements are: comprehensively failing to complete the state plan, with output only reaching 94 percent, and quality only reaching 75 percent... The mechanical power section is the "winning" unit in the competition. Its achievements are: equipment accidents increasing month by month, with January as 100, February increasing to 180, and March increasing to 343; because of accidents, cement production was reduced by 11,000 tons, and repair costs wasted more than 30,000 yuan.
    The leaders were also afraid that this kind of "evaluation" would not work among the masses, so they held a grand meeting to celebrate, issue red flags, and give prizes. Unfortunately, this painstaking effort did not achieve the expected results. The chairman of the trade union praised on the stage, but the workers criticized under the stage: "If you can't complete the plan, what kind of advanced is that?" "Does the leadership want us to learn from their example of having more accidents?" The leaders considered these righteous calls from the staff to be "divorced from reality" and "demanding too much!" What a wonderful logic.
    Everyone knows that labor competition is a method of building socialism and communism on the basis of the greatest enthusiasm of the millions of working people. How can it be said to promote socialist construction and accelerate national industrialization by selecting units that have not completed their plans as winners in the competition, like the Fushun Cement Plant? Units that fail to complete their plans are praised as "advanced" and "winning," while the masses who demand the completion of the plan are criticized as "rash" and "divorced from reality"; this absurd logic cannot be explained by "ideological confusion," it can only be said that they have serious individualism, and in order to cover up their mistakes in not completing the state plan, they do not hesitate to confuse right and wrong and distort the facts.
    The leaders of the Fushun Cement Plant should honestly mobilize the masses to examine the shortcomings in their work, and mobilize the masses to face and overcome these shortcomings. Glossing over mistakes is not in line with the true colors of Communist Party members and state workers. It not only cannot promote the improvement of work, but will also make oneself sink deeper and deeper in mistakes, make the righteousness among the masses unable to be carried forward, and make the shortcomings in work continue to develop.

    奇怪的竞赛
    丁力
    抚顺水泥厂今年第一季度开展了劳动竞赛。各车间都把完成产量、成本、劳动生产率……等六大指标提作了竞赛条件。
    可是，第一季度的国家计划没有完成，各车间的竞赛条件也都没有实现。
    怎么办呢？水泥厂的领导人员想：如果按国家计划指标完成的情况评比，谁也没有得胜，评出来不好看，会影响大伙的“情绪”。为了继续保持竞赛的“热烈”，他们想出了一种“矮子里面选将军”的办法，选拔出来“先进”的和“优胜”的单位，来“推动”大家前进。
    让我们来看看这些“先进”和“优胜”单位的成绩吧！
    原料车间是竞赛的“先进”车间，成绩是：全面地没有完成国家计划，产量只达到百分之九十四，质量只达到百分之七十五……。机械动力科是竞赛的“优胜”单位，成绩是：设备事故月月增加，以一月份为一百，二月份增至一八○，三月份增至三四三；因为事故，影响水泥减产一万一千吨，修理费浪费三万多元。
    领导人员还怕这种“评比”在群众中起不了作用，于是开大会庆贺，发红旗，给奖品。可惜，这番苦心没有收到预期的效果。工会主席在台上表扬，工人们却在台下批评：“完不成计划，还算什么先进？”“难道领导上要我们学习他们多出事故的榜样吗？”对职工这种正义的呼声，领导人员却认为是“脱离实际”，“要求太高”了！真是奇妙的逻辑。
    人们都知道，劳动竞赛是在千百万劳动群众最大积极性的基础上建设社会主义和共产主义的方法。像抚顺水泥厂这样，把完不成计划的单位选为竞赛的优胜者，怎么谈得上推进社会主义建设和加速国家工业化呢？完不成计划的单位，被表扬是“先进”、“优胜”，而要求完成计划的群众，却被批评是“冒进”、“脱离实际”；这种荒谬的逻辑不能用“思想糊涂”来解释，只能说他们存在着严重的个人主义，为了掩饰自己没有完成国家计划的错误，不惜混淆是非，颠倒黑白。
    抚顺水泥厂的领导人员们，应该老老实实地动员群众检查工作中的缺点，动员群众来正视和克服这些缺点。粉饰错误是不符合共产党员和国家工作人员的本色的，它不但不能推动工作的改善，反而会使自己在错误中越陷越深，使群众中的正气不能发扬，使工作中的缺点继续发展。
