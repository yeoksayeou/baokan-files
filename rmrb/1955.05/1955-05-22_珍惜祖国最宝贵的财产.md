Cherishing the Most Valuable Asset of the Motherland
　　Zhu Bo

Our country has spent a lot of money to establish various technical schools, and professors have devoted countless efforts to teach their students. The purpose is to train various technical talents for the country to participate in the economic construction of the motherland. These talents are the most valuable asset of our country. We must cherish them, rationally allocate their work, and enable them to fully发挥their enthusiasm and creativity in the posts of building the motherland.

However, there are also some people who ruthlessly waste our country's limited technical talents.

This phenomenon is seriously present in some units in the Northwest. For example, the person in charge of a construction unit has always shouted that the unit lacks technical personnel in the past, and has repeatedly requested the higher-level unit to allocate more technical personnel to them. The higher-level considered their specific difficulties and transferred nearly a hundred graduates from Shanghai and Suzhou Construction Engineering Schools and Zhejiang Civil Engineering School, and told them to use these graduates rationally, pointing out that these people, after a certain period of practical work training and cultivation, will become specialized technical talents of the country. However, the responsible comrades and personnel department staff of this unit did not accept this correct opinion. They only assigned a small number of people to the work area, and most of them stayed in the leadership department without work to do. Therefore, the graduates who originally came to participate in the construction of the motherland with full enthusiasm became very depressed. They have nothing to do all day, only reading newspapers in the office. It is said that some people have finished reading more than 20 novels in a month.

The graduates assigned to the work area are also very distressed. Because the personnel department did not explain to the work area director the expertise and work tasks of these people, the work area director only knew that they were all young intellectuals, so he assigned them to do some cultural education and clerical work.

What is even more wrong is that when the Ministry of Construction Engineering wanted to transfer a group of young people with junior high school education to study water and electricity installation, welding, and pipeline measurement, the personnel department of this unit selected several from this group of young people who had just graduated from secondary technical schools to send them (and then returned them), the reason being that they were educated and learned quickly. If different opinions are raised, they will say: Isn't it good to learn more skills?

This unreasonable use of technical talents is also manifested in some other construction units. Here, it is not difficult to see that there are technical personnel specializing in railway construction and engineers specializing in water conservancy projects in the civil engineering department; in the inspection room, you can see technical personnel specializing in building materials; and in the material testing institute, there are design engineers. However, other departments are very lacking in the above-mentioned technical talents.

This situation should be reversed immediately. A reasonable adjustment should be made to the existing technical personnel. Otherwise, it will affect the growth of our country's technical strength and the development of our motherland's construction cause.

    珍惜祖国最宝贵的财产
　　朱波
    我们的国家用了许多金钱来开办各种技术学校，教授们不知耗费了多少心血来教导他们的学生，目的就是要为国家培养各种技术人材，参加祖国的经济建设事业。这些人材是我们国家最宝贵的财产。我们一定要珍惜他们，合理地分配他们的工作，使他们在建设祖国的岗位上充分地发挥积极性和创造性。
    但是，也有一部分人，却无情地浪费我们国家有限的技术人材。
    在西北某些单位就严重地存在着这种现象。例如一个施工单位的负责人员，过去一直喊叫本单位缺乏技术人员，数次请求上级单位多分配一些技术人员给他们。上级考虑到他们的具体困难，从上海、苏州建筑工程学校和浙江省土木工程学校调来了将近百名毕业生，而且告诉他们要合理地使用这些毕业生，指出这些人如经过一定时期的实际工作的锻炼和培养，都会成为国家的专门技术人材的。但是，这个单位的负责同志和人事部门的人员，没有接受这个正确的意见，他们只把少数的人分配到工区去，多数留在领导部门没有工作做。因此，使得本来抱着满腔热情来参加祖国建设事业的毕业生变得非常消沉。他们整天没有事情干，只有在办公室里看一看书报。据说有的人一个月内读完了二十多部小说。
    那些分配到工区去的毕业生，也非常苦闷。因为人事部门没有向工区主任交代这些人的专长和工作任务，工区主任仅知道他们都是青年知识分子，于是就分配他们做一些文化教育工作和文书工作。
    更错误的是，当建筑工程部要调一批具有初中文化程度的青年去学习水电安装、焊接和管道测量等技术的时候，这个单位的人事部门又从这批刚从中等技术学校毕业出来的青年中，挑选了几个送去了（后来又退了回来），理由是他们有文化，学得快。如果提出不同的意见，他们就会说：多学会一门技术还不好吗？
    这种对技术人材使用不合理的现象还表现在其它一些施工单位。在这里人们不难看到，在土建部门有专门搞铁道建设的技术人员，也有专门搞水利工程的工程师；在监察室里可以看见专门搞建筑材料的技术人员；在材料试验所里又有设计工程师。但是，在另一些部门却又十分缺乏上述技术人材。
    这种状况应该立即扭转。对现有技术人员应该进行一次合理的调整。不然，将会影响我们国家的技术力量的增长，影响我们祖国建设事业的发展。
