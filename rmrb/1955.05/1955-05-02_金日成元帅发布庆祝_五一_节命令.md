Marshal Kim Il-sung issued an order on International Labor Day "May Day," extending congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and all the Korean people.

The order stated: "After the war, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, the Korean people, with the enormous assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries, are rapidly restoring and constructing the people's economy that was brutally destroyed during the war. The material and cultural living standards of the working people are steadily improving."

The order continued: "U.S. imperialism is propagating atomic and hydrogen weapons, intensifying international tensions, wantonly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, and frantically expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army." The order pointed out: "The power of millions of peace-loving people united is giving the imperialist war-mongers a powerful blow, ready at any time to crush their adventurous actions."

The order called on all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army to raise their class consciousness and political and ideological levels, to enhance their political vigilance; to continuously improve their combat skills, to master modern weapons; to continuously strengthen the combat friendship with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers; and to prepare to give a decisive rebuff to any adventurous actions by the enemy.
