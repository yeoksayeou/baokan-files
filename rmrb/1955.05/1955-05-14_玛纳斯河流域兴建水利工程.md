　　Water Conservancy Projects to be Built in the Manas River Basin
    Water conservancy construction in the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang is being stepped up this year. The Daquangou Reservoir, which is being built in Shawan County, will be completed by the end of July this year. This reservoir will store 32 million cubic meters of water. The 65-kilometer-long Daqu canal on the west bank of the Manas River has been excavated for 60 kilometers. After the canal is completed, it will transport water from the Daquangou Reservoir to irrigate 150,000 mu of wasteland planned for reclamation. The Liugou Reservoir, which is planned to be built in Usu County, will divert and store 74 million cubic meters of water from the Sikeshu River to irrigate 700,000 mu of wasteland planned for reclamation. The survey and preliminary design of this reservoir have been completed, and construction is scheduled to begin in August this year. In order to reorganize the canal system in the upper reaches of the Manas River and reduce the cost of repairing temporary dams every year, it is planned to build a permanent barrage and a main canal on the east bank in the upper reaches of the river, and survey and design work is now underway.

　　玛纳斯河流域兴建水利工程
    新疆玛纳斯河流域今年的水利建设正在加紧进行。修建在沙湾县境内的大泉沟水库，将于今年七月底竣工。这座水库将蓄水三千二百万立方公尺。长达六十五公里的玛纳斯河西岸大渠，已经开挖了六十公里，渠道修成后，将输送大泉沟水库的水，灌溉十五万亩计划开垦的荒地。准备在乌苏县境内修建的柳沟水库，将引蓄四棵树河的水七千四百万立方公尺，灌溉计划开垦的荒地七十万亩，这座水库的勘测和初步设计已经完成，预定今年八月开工。为了整理玛纳斯河上游的渠道系统和减少每年修临时坝的费用，计划在河的上游修筑一座永久性的拦河坝和东岸的总干渠，现在正从事勘测设计中。　（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
