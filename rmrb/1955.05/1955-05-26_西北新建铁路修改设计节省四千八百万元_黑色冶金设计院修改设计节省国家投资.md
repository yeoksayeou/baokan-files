Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 25th. The Northwest Design Branch of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently drafted a preliminary plan to modify the unreasonable design of the new Northwest Railway and reduce unnecessary construction projects, which can save the country more than 48 million yuan in construction investment.

The Northwest Design Branch adopted many measures to reduce engineering costs in formulating this plan. For example, between Hexibao and Zhangye on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, using locally produced cohesive loess bricks to build house walls can reduce the cost by more than 30 yuan per square meter compared to using brick walls, while the service life of the house is comparable to that of general brick structures. In the past, the ballast on the roadbed of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was all broken by hand. In the future, it is planned to use unbroken pebbles as ballast. This year alone, Hexibao-Zhangye section and Lanzhou station can save more than 1.2 million yuan. In 1954, four inspection ladders had to be built next to each newly built bridge and culvert on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The cost of this kind of inspection ladder is high, and simple earth steps will be used instead in the future. The sidewalks and iron railings on both sides of large and medium-sized bridges will also be changed to only one side in the future. In this way, calculating only the large and medium-sized bridges on the Lanzhou-Dijiatai section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway can save the country 120,000 yuan in engineering costs. The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will also reduce unnecessary building construction with an area of ​​60,000 square meters.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 24th. The Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has adopted more than 60 design modification suggestions put forward by technical personnel this year, which can save the country a total of more than 1.6 million yuan in investment.

The water transmission pipeline under construction from Anshan to Dagushan was originally determined to use iron pipes with a larger diameter. Designer Ao Qikui discovered that part of the sewage from the Dagushan concentrator plant could still be used after recycling and sedimentation. Therefore, the amount of water sent from Anshan to Dagushan per hour can be reduced by 13 percent compared with the original design scheme. According to Ao Qikui's suggestion, the design institute reduced the diameter of the water transmission pipeline by 50 mm, which can save more than 300 tons of iron. The current production capacity of the filters in the Anshan Concentrator Plant is 30 to 100 percent greater than the original design capacity. When technicians Zhu Zhangyao and Tian Guangchun were designing the construction of the new Anshan Concentrator Plant, based on this actual situation, they reduced the number of filters originally decided to be used in the technical design by 20 percent, which also saved a large amount of investment.

　　西北新建铁路修改设计节省四千八百万元
　  黑色冶金设计院修改设计节省国家投资
    新华社兰州二十五日电　铁道部设计总局西北设计分局，最近拟订了修改西北新建铁路不合理设计、削减不必要的工程项目的初步计划，共计可以为国家节省建筑投资四千八百万元以上。
    西北设计分局在拟订这个计划中采取了许多降低工程造价的措施。如兰新铁路河西堡到张掖间，利用当地出产的黏性黄土坯修筑房屋墙壁，比用砖砌墙每平方公尺可降低造价三十多元，而房屋使用年限和一般砖结构不相上下。兰新铁路路基上过去铺的卵石道碴全部是用人工打碎的，今后计划改用不打碎的卵石做道碴，仅河西堡—张掖段和兰州站，今年就可节省一百二十多万元。一九五四年兰新铁路上新建的每一座桥涵旁边，都要修筑四座检查梯，这种检查梯的造价高，以后将改用简单的土台阶来代替。大、中桥上两边的人行道和铁栏杆，以后也将改成只修一边。这样，仅就包兰铁路兰州—狄家台段的大、中桥计算，就可为国家节省十二万元工程费用。宝成铁路北段还将削减面积达六万平方公尺的不必要的房屋建筑。
    新华社鞍山二十四日电　重工业部黑色冶金设计院今年已采纳了技术人员们所提出的六十多件修改设计的建议，共可为国家节省投资一百六十多万元。
    正在建设的鞍山到大孤山的输水管道，原来确定用直径较大的铁管子。设计员敖启奎发现大孤山选矿厂有一部分污水经过回收沉淀后仍可以利用，因此鞍山送给大孤山的水量每小时可以比原来设计的方案减少百分之十三。设计院根据敖启奎的建议，把输水管道的直径改小了五十公厘，这样就可以节省三百多吨铁。鞍山选矿厂的过滤机现在的生产能力比原来的设计能力大了百分之三十到百分之一百，技术员朱章耀和田广纯在为鞍山新的选矿厂作施工设计时，根据这一实际情况，把原来技术设计决定要采用的过滤机的数量，减少了百分之二十，也节省了大批投资。
