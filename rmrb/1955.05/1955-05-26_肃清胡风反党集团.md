　　Purging the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
　　Cao Ming

　　The materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique disclosed by the "People's Daily" fully demonstrate that Hu Feng and his clique are our enemies, and vicious enemies at that. Have we seen such enemies before? Yes, those were the Fascists who sat in secret courts and in concentration camps to judge our comrades. But it is rare to see those who sit in our literary ranks, wear the cloak of Marxism, and claim to be revolutionaries. After reading Hu Feng's self-criticism, I am reminded of other scenes: Whenever a conspirator sees his plot exposed, he always pretends to be pitiful, talking about "blindness," "remorse," "guilt," and other deceptive nonsense. But if one day their "ideal" is realized, they will be completely rude and openly use "whips wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire" to lash us.

　　Of course, the "ideal" of the Hu Feng ilk will never be realized, because we have a strong and well-trained Party leading us. This time, we have again won a victory on the literary front. However, we cannot rest easy because of this, thinking that the matter is over. No, we must continue to expose the ugly crimes of Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people activities. All those who are willing to defend the revolutionary literary cause should participate in exposing Hu Feng, who pretends to support the revolution but actually opposes it, and purge his anti-Party clique. All those who are willing to defend the revolutionary cause and work hard for socialist construction should be vigilant and search for such disguised elements who falsely claim to be revolutionaries in all fronts and industries, and stop their sabotage activities.

　　We should think about how Hu Feng could deceive us for more than twenty years? This is a major lesson. Of course, Hu Feng's anti-Party activities were carried out in secret, with the backbone elements under his command charging into battle for him, and a group of blindly following elements cheering him on. And many comrades in our cultural and artistic circles have varying degrees of idealism and liberalism in their thinking, which happened to build a wall of invisibility for Hu Feng. Hu Feng's anti-Party activities were carried out in secret, and his weapons for public offense were words—spreading the extremely reactionary subjective idealism and egoism of the bourgeoisie, attempting to ideologically disintegrate us and disarm us of Marxism.

　　For more than ten years, Hu Feng's reactionary remarks, cloaked in Marxism, have been severely criticized by our Party, and progressive people outside the Party have also criticized him. However, a large number of comrades either did not pay attention to those remarks or could not smell anything from them, and even after the launch of the criticism movement, some comrades were not very concerned about this movement and expressed indifference. Some comrades also have certain erroneous views that coincide with some of Hu Feng's views, and therefore failed to draw a clear line between themselves and his essentially reactionary views, which allowed Hu Feng to fish in troubled waters.

　　In the past six months, the Party Central Committee has called on us to conscientiously study materialism. Many comrades have enthusiastically participated in this study, and after settling the idealist viewpoints in our literary and art circles and the idealist thoughts of each of us, our understanding has greatly improved, our awareness has improved, and as soon as Hu Feng was seen, he lost his hiding place and had to reveal his true colors.

　　Therefore, we must pursue the victory and continue to expose the ugly nature of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique; at the same time, we must also intensify the arming of our minds with Marxism-Leninism, so as to improve our understanding, sharpen our political sense of smell, raise our awareness, and make it impossible for the Hu Feng clique and other anti-Party elements to hide.

### 肃清胡风反党集团

　　肃清胡风反党集团
　　草明
    “人民日报”所揭露的关于胡风反党集团的材料，充分说明了胡风及其集团是我们的敌人，而且是一个狠毒的敌人。这样的敌人我们看见过没有呢？看见过的，是坐在秘密的法庭里，在集中营里审判我们的同志的那些法西斯分子。而坐在我们的文艺队伍里，披起马克思主义外衣，口口声声以革命者自居的，倒也罕见。看了胡风的检讨，我倒想起另外一些景象：凡是阴谋家看见自己事情败露时，总是装的很可怜，在那儿说什么“盲目性”，什么“悔恨”“内疚”等骗人鬼话。但如果有一天他们的“理想”实现，他就会完全不客气，可以公开地“用橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”来抽打我们的。
    当然，胡风之流的“理想”是永远不会实现的，那是因为我们有久经锻炼的强大的党在领着我们走。这一次在文艺战线上，我们又获得了胜利。然而我们不能就因此高枕无忧，以为事情已经过去。不，我们要继续揭露胡风反党反人民的丑恶罪行。一切愿意保卫革命的文艺事业的人，都应参加揭露伪装拥护革命、而实际反对革命的胡风，肃清他的反党集团。一切愿意保卫革命事业，努力于社会主义建设的人，都应在各个战线上，各个行业里警惕和搜索那种冒称革命的伪装分子，制止他们的破坏活动。
    我们应该想一下，胡风怎样可能欺骗我们二十多年的？这是一个重大的教训。当然，胡风的反党活动是秘密进行的，受他指挥的骨干分子替他冲锋陷阵，又有一批盲从分子替他摇旗助威。而我们文化艺术界里不少同志在思想上存在着各种程度的唯心主义和自由主义，又恰好给胡风筑了一道隐身的墙。胡风的反党活动是秘密进行的，而他的公开进攻的武器却是言论——散播资产阶级的极反动的主观唯心主义和唯我主义，企图从思想上瓦解我们，解除我们马克思主义的武装。
    十多年来，胡风的披了马克思主义外衣的反动言论，受到了我党的严正的批判，党外的进步人士也曾批评过他。但是很大数量的同志却是对那些言论不过问或看了也嗅不出什么来，甚至展开批判运动以后，还有一些同志对这个运动不太关心，表示冷淡。也有一部分同志还存在某些错误观点，和胡风某些观点偶合，因而未能和他的实质上是反动的观点划清界线，胡风也就得以混水摸鱼。
    近半年来，党中央号召我们认真学习唯物主义，很多同志热情地参加了这个学习，并从清算我们文艺界里的唯心观点和我们每个人的唯心思想以后，我们认识大大提高了，觉悟提高了，眼看见胡风就失去了藏身的地方，不能不原形毕露了。
    所以，我们要乘胜追击，继续揭发胡风反党集团的丑恶；同时还要加紧用马克思列宁主义武装我们的头脑，以便提高认识，敏锐政治嗅觉，提高觉悟，使胡风集团和其他反党分子没处隐藏。
