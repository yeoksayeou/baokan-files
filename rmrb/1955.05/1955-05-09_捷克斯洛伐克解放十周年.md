　　The tenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. In the past decade, the Czechoslovak people have achieved brilliant victories in the cause of striving for peace, democracy, and building socialism.

　　May 9, 1945, was a turning point in Czechoslovak history. The heroic Soviet army destroyed the remnants of the Hitler bandit army, liberated Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and ended the days of humiliation and suffering brought to the Czechoslovak people by "Munich." The freedom and national independence that the Czechoslovak people had fought for with bloodshed for many centuries were truly realized, and a new era appeared in the history of Czechoslovakia.

　　In the past ten years, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has illuminated the path forward for the Czechoslovak people with all its glory. It led the Czechoslovak people through the difficult period of post-war economic recovery, crushed the bourgeois forces that colluded with foreign imperialism and plotted to restore capitalism, and completed the complex and huge construction tasks of the first five-year plan. It correctly used the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, strengthened the people's democratic system, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and successfully solved the national question, enabling the two fraternal nations of Czechs and Slovaks to unite closely and march forward bravely on the road to socialism.

　　The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, following the Leninist principles of building socialism, has first vigorously developed heavy industry. Now the development of Czechoslovak industry has exceeded the level reached during the nearly one hundred and fifty years of capitalist development in the country by more than double. The proportion of industrial production in the entire national economy has reached about 80 percent, and the capitalist components in industry have been eliminated. The proportion of heavy industrial production in the total industrial output value has reached about two-thirds. The production of machine manufacturing has increased by more than two and a half times. Ninety-seven percent of cities and villages have been electrified. While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, light industry has also developed accordingly. With the rapid development of industry, the socialist transformation of agriculture has also achieved remarkable results, and at present, the socialist components in agriculture account for nearly half. In many unified agricultural cooperatives organized according to socialist principles, the latest agricultural machinery and technology are used. With the surge in the national economy, the people's living standards have greatly improved, and there has been a surge in culture. At present, the Czechoslovak people are continuing to step up socialist construction and are struggling to further develop production and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

　　The consolidated unity and close cooperation with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp is an effective guarantee for Czechoslovakia to build socialism and consolidate its national independence. Post-war history has proven that no force can stop the Czechoslovak people from advancing towards the path of peace, democracy, and socialism. Located on the western frontier of the peaceful and democratic camp, the Czechoslovak people are making significant contributions to the cause of defending socialism and safeguarding peace.

　　The independent, strong, and peace-loving Czechoslovak Republic, together with the countries of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, has consistently made unremitting efforts to defend world peace and promote international cooperation. In the United Nations Organization and in various other international occasions, the representatives of Czechoslovakia actively safeguard the peace and security of all countries and oppose the imperialist policy of aggression. Czechoslovakia firmly opposes the US imperialist "policy of strength" of establishing aggressive military blocs and preparing for a new war. The Czechoslovak people, who suffered great sacrifices under the enslavement of German fascism, particularly oppose the Paris Accords that rearm West Germany. At present, the Czechoslovak government, together with the governments of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, is taking important measures to prevent the threat of the Paris Accords reviving West German militarism. The Chinese people fully support this just struggle. The Czechoslovak people are also closely concerned about the struggles of the Eastern peoples. They are deeply concerned about and fully support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose US imperialist interference; they actively participated in the supervision of the Korean armistice and played an important role; they welcomed the achievements of the Asian-African Conference. In international affairs, Czechoslovakia is one of the most active participants and plays a positive role.

　　China and Czechoslovakia, in the East and the West, are both on the front lines of the great struggle to defend world peace and oppose US imperialist aggression, and are advancing side by side towards the common goal of realizing socialism. In the past five years, the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people have been further developed. In 1955, the trade volume between China and Czechoslovakia increased by more than three and a half times compared with 1950. Scientific cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Czechoslovakia are also increasing. Czechoslovakia's highly developed technical experience and excellent machinery are one of the important factors in helping China accelerate socialist construction.

　　Today, on the occasion of celebrating Czechoslovakia's historically significant liberation day, the Chinese people warmly congratulate the Czechoslovak people on achieving new and greater successes in the cause of defending peace and building socialism. The Chinese people know that every achievement of the Czechoslovak people will strengthen the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年
    捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年了。十年来捷克斯洛伐克人民在争取和平、民主和建设社会主义的事业中取得了辉煌的胜利。
    一九四五年五月九日是捷克斯洛伐克历史的转折点。英勇的苏联军队摧毁了希特勒匪军的残余部队，解放了捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格，结束了“慕尼黑”给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来的屈辱和苦难的日子。捷克斯洛伐克人民许多世纪以来流血斗争所争取的自由和民族独立真正实现了，在捷克斯洛伐克的历史上出现了一个新的时期。
    在过去十年中，捷克斯洛伐克共产党以它的全部光辉照耀着捷克斯洛伐克人民前进的道路。它领导着捷克斯洛伐克人民走过了战后恢复国民经济的困难时期，粉碎了勾结外国帝国主义、阴谋复辟的资产阶级势力，完成了第一个五年计划的复杂和巨大的建设任务。它正确地运用马克思列宁主义的武器，加强了人民民主制度，巩固了工农联盟，顺利解决了民族问题，使捷克和斯洛伐克两个兄弟民族紧密团结，勇往直前地走上社会主义的道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党遵循着建设社会主义的列宁主义原则，首先大力发展重工业。现在捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展已经超过了本国资本主义发展时期将近一百五十年所达到的水平一倍以上。工业生产在整个国民经济中的比重已达到百分之八十左右，工业中的资本主义成分已经肃清。重工业的生产在工业总产值中的比重已约达三分之二。机器制造业的生产增加了两倍半以上。百分之九十七的城市和乡村都已经电气化了。在优先发展重工业的同时，轻工业也相应地发展了。随着工业的飞速发展，农业中社会主义的改造也获得显著成就，目前农业中社会主义成分已占将近一半。在按照社会主义原则组织起来的许多统一农业合作社中，使用着最新的农业机器和技术。随着国民经济的高涨，人民的生活水平大大提高，出现了文化的高涨。目前，捷克斯洛伐克人民正在继续加紧社会主义建设，为进一步发展生产、提高人民物质和文化生活的水平而斗争。
    同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的巩固团结和亲密合作，是捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义和巩固国家独立的有效保证。战后的历史证明，任何力量都不能阻止捷克斯洛伐克人民向着和平、民主和社会主义的道路前进。处在和平民主阵营的西方前沿，捷克斯洛伐克人民正对捍卫社会主义、维护和平的事业作出重大的贡献。
    独立强盛和爱好和平的捷克斯洛伐克共和国，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国一起，一贯为保卫世界和平和促进国际合作进行不懈的努力。在联合国组织中以及其他各种国际场合，捷克斯洛伐克的代表积极地维护各国的和平和安全、反对帝国主义侵略政策。捷克斯洛伐克坚决反对美帝国主义建立侵略性军事集团和准备新战争的“实力政策”。曾在德国法西斯奴役下遭受重大牺牲的捷克斯洛伐克人民，特别反对重新武装西德的巴黎协定。目前捷克斯洛伐克政府正同苏联及欧洲其他爱好和平国家的政府一起，采取重要措施，制止巴黎协定复活西德军国主义的威胁。中国人民完全支持这一正义的斗争。捷克斯洛伐克人民也密切关怀东方人民的斗争，他们十分关切并完全支持中国人民解放台湾、反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争；他们积极参加朝鲜停战的监督工作，起了重要的作用；他们欢迎亚非会议的成就。在国际事务中，捷克斯洛伐克是最活跃的参加者之一，发挥着积极的作用。
    中捷两国在东方和西方，都处在保卫世界和平、反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争的前线，并为实现社会主义的共同目标齐步前进。五年来，中捷两国人民的友好合作关系获得进一步的发展。一九五五年中捷两国的贸易额比一九五○年增加了三倍半以上。中捷两国的科学合作和文化交流也日益增进。捷克斯洛伐克的高度发展的技术经验和精良的机器是帮助中国加速社会主义建设的重要因素之一。
    今天，在庆祝捷克斯洛伐克的有历史意义的解放节日的时候，中国人民热烈祝贺捷克斯洛伐克人民在保卫和平和建设社会主义的事业中获得新的更大的成就。中国人民知道，捷克斯洛伐克人民的每一成就都将加强和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量。
