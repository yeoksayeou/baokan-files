Hubei is preparing to build a new type of cork factory. It will be a new type of cork factory in our country. Currently, the factory's construction committee is intensifying its planning work. This factory will be built in the raw material producing area, which will not only eliminate the reverse flow in transportation and reduce costs, but also greatly shorten the raw material supply time.

The raw material for cork industrial products is the cork oak, commonly known as "flower oak tree", which can be used for cork bricks needed for refrigeration in ships, trains, and the food industry, and can also be used for insulation equipment in the chemical industry. This kind of cork industrial raw material is widely distributed in the mountainous areas of northwestern and northeastern Hubei Province, but it has not been utilized before liberation, and the domestic demand for cork industrial products relies on imports from abroad.

　  湖北筹建新型软木厂
    国营湖北软木厂正在筹建。它将是我国的一座新型软木厂。现在这个软木厂的建厂委员会正在加紧进行筹划工作。这个厂将在原料产区建立起来，它不仅可以消灭运程上的逆流现象、降低成本，同时还将大大缩短原料供应时间。
    软木工业品的原料是栓皮栎，俗称“花栎树”，可作船舶、火车、食品工业等冷藏需用的软木砖，还可作化学工业的保温设备之用。这种软木工业原料在湖北省西北部和东北部山区分布很广，但在解放前却一直未被利用，国内所需软木工业品依靠国外输入。
