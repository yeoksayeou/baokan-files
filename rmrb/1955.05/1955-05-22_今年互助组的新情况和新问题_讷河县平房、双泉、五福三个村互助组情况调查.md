　　New Situations and Problems of Mutual Aid Teams This Year
    ——An Investigation of Mutual Aid Teams in Pingfang, Shuangquan, and Wufu Villages, Nehe County
    Editor's Note: The development of the agricultural cooperativization movement has not only attracted many farmers to join agricultural production cooperatives but has also caused great changes among the peasant masses outside the cooperatives. In order to strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee sent Comrades Zhang Dianju, Fu Yanlong, Hao Jingmin, and Sun Rongsheng to conduct a relatively in-depth investigation of the changes and existing problems in mutual aid teams in three villages with different levels of cooperativization. What is published here is their investigation report. These investigation materials are helpful for understanding the current situation of mutual aid teams and improving the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Agricultural cooperative organizations in Pingfang, Shuangquan, and Wufu villages, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, have made great progress this year. Pingfang Village has ten agricultural production cooperatives, with participating farmers accounting for 67 percent of the total number of households; Shuangquan Village has eight agricultural production cooperatives, with participating farmers accounting for 49 percent of the total number of households; Wufu Village has four agricultural production cooperatives, with participating farmers accounting for 27 percent of the total number of households. Farmers outside the cooperatives in the three villages account for 57 percent of the total number of farmers; the labor force accounts for 49.3 percent of the total; draught animals account for 45.3 percent; land: dry land accounts for 42.7 percent, and paddy fields account for 53.4 percent. These farmers have formed 61 mutual aid teams.
    After the widespread development of agricultural production cooperatives this spring, a series of changes have been triggered:
    1. Ideological Changes: The influence of the agricultural cooperativization movement has spread to every class in the countryside. Where to go has become the center of rural public opinion.
    A total of 265 poor peasant households are outside the cooperatives in these three villages. The vast majority of poor peasants wholeheartedly yearn for cooperativization and actively advocate "running mutual aid teams well, creating conditions, and striving to establish cooperatives." In Shuangquan Village, six poor peasant households in Zhang Xigui's mutual aid team, who originally had no horses, bought horses in preparation for the autumn establishment of a cooperative. When they heard anyone speak ill of the cooperative movement, they debated with them and actively exposed the behavior of rich peasant elements in sabotaging the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, they also have some dissatisfaction and concerns about the existing agricultural production cooperatives. They are very dissatisfied with the average investment of agricultural production cooperatives according to labor force. (The six new cooperatives built in Shuangquan Village this year almost all took seeds and fodder according to labor force.) They also see that the current agricultural production cooperatives have a narrow scope of operation and simple production content, which cannot fully utilize the role of various labor forces. Therefore, they are worried that after joining the cooperative, they will have no work to do, which will affect their lives. In addition, a few "errand runners" are unwilling to join the cooperative because they are accustomed to nomadic life and fear being restricted.
      There are a total of 32 middle peasant households outside the cooperatives in these three villages. Their attitudes vary depending on the development of cooperativization in each village and the different methods of handling the means of production in each cooperative. In villages with a small proportion of cooperativization, the middle peasants have the mentality of trying to "delay as much as possible," maintaining the status quo in production, wanting to "wait and see," and saying "it's easier outside." In villages with a large proportion of cooperativization, the middle peasants generally have the mentality of "quickly establishing a household foundation." Their approach to "establishing a household foundation" is to use extensive farming methods to plant as much land as possible and grow more high-priced crops. In Pingfang Village, five cooperatives prematurely abolished land remuneration, and the evaluation of other means of production was too low, so farmers outside the cooperatives were unwilling to take good care of the land and purchase means of production. Sun Qingyun, a middle peasant in Xiping Tun, used to save manure for four or five *qiang* of land every year, but this year he only has manure for three *qiang* of land. There are also individual households who do not produce well and spend lavishly. Eight households have sold 14 *qiang* of land. They said: There is not much to wander around outside the cooperative. The agricultural production cooperatives in Shuangquan Village have handled land and other means of production more cautiously, and the production enthusiasm of farmers outside the cooperatives is relatively normal. Accumulating manure, delivering manure, and purchasing means of production are all more active. They reflect: Buying means of production can now be used to improve their own production, and it will not be a loss to join the cooperative in the future.
    Individual wealthy households with serious capitalist tendencies take a passive resistance and actively break away from restrictions towards the cooperativization movement. They sell off the means of production, withdraw production funds, and organize fake cooperatives and fake teams. For example, Liu Yonghe in Shuangquan Village sold and pawned off all of his more than 11 *qiang* of land and three horses. Yang Futian in Wufu Village sold all seven of his cattle. They declared: Doing so will be "clean" when joining the cooperative in the future and "save on turning it over to the public." Wang Sheng, a new rich peasant in Pingfang Village, colluded with seven landlord and rich peasant households, people who had been expelled from the Party, and some deceived peasants to run a fake cooperative; after being exposed, he went to backward *tun* to run a fake mutual aid team. Shi Naicai in Shuangquan Village saw that twelve new farmers had moved into his *tun*, so he tried every means to prevent them from establishing a mutual aid team, attempting to win them over to organize a fake mutual aid team. There are also people who move their families to backward *tun* in order to carry out exploitative activities.
    2. Organizational Changes: Many mutual aid teams have undergone great changes in membership because key members and some farmers were drawn out to join cooperatives when they were established. According to the statistics of 61 mutual aid teams in the three villages, 16 teams were newly formed by scattered households, 30 teams had half of their members changed, and only 15 teams remained basically unchanged. This change has brought many new problems for consolidating and improving mutual aid teams this year:
    The scale of mutual aid teams has shrunk, which is not conducive to improving technology. Among the mutual aid teams in these three villages, 21 teams have three to five households, 33 have six to ten households, and only seven have more than ten households. Most of those with more than ten households are teams that are preparing to establish cooperatives in 1956. They have strong horsepower, sufficient manpower, a solid foundation, good production, and high enthusiasm. Many of the teams with six to ten households are so-called "strong seeking strong" "wealthy teams." They generally do not lack the means of production but lack labor. Although some have also absorbed poor households, the poor households are worried that the wealthy households will "throw" them out when they cannot be used. Most of the teams with three to five households are "poor peasant teams" with weak horsepower, insufficient manpower, a weak foundation, difficulties in production, and low enthusiasm.
    The economic status of team members varies greatly, and the phenomenon of "two ends left" (the particularly wealthy and the particularly poor have not joined the cooperative) has appeared; some teams have very complex compositions. This situation is not obvious in villages with a small proportion of cooperativization, but it is particularly prominent in villages with a large proportion. In Zhao Yuqi's mutual aid team in Pingfang Village, seven of the twelve households are wealthy middle peasants, and five are poor peasants with little land and thin horses. The poor peasants have low enthusiasm and no confidence in production within the team. Song Dianqing said: "I can't afford to invest in the cooperative, and I can't do the work; in this team, people (referring to wealthy households) don't ask me to attend meetings. I really have no way to go." There are also landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements in some mutual aid teams. Under this new situation, the work of implementing class policies within the mutual aid teams has become more complex and difficult.
    Mutual aid teams lack leading backbone. Most Party members and activists have already joined the cooperative, and the Party members and activists outside the cooperative are concentrated in some teams that are preparing to establish cooperatives in 1956. There are a total of 69 Party members in the three villages, with eight in mutual aid teams, accounting for 11.6 percent; there are 112 Communist Youth League members, with 28 in mutual aid teams, accounting for 25 percent. The current situation of team leaders is: 27 have been team leaders for two years, accounting for 44.3 percent; 34 have just become team leaders, accounting for 55.7 percent. Among them, 19 are active, fair, and capable, accounting for 31.2 percent; 11 are capable but somewhat unfair in handling affairs, accounting for 18 percent; and 31 are not active, accounting for 50.8 percent. In villages with a high degree of cooperativization, many mutual aid team leaders say: There is not much to be a team leader anymore, the mutual aid teams are getting smaller and smaller, and it is becoming more and more difficult to run them.
    3. Leadership Problems: Many grassroots cadres have insufficient understanding of the new situations and problems brought about by the development of the cooperativization movement and are not good at solving the current new problems of mutual aid teams. Many people have the idea of "rather collapse ten teams than collapse one cooperative." Therefore, the production of most mutual aid teams is not going well. In these three villages, there are 45 mutual aid teams without any production plan, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total number of mutual aid teams. From the perspective of the mutual benefit system, 17 teams have clear regulations, accounting for 28 percent; 44 have no regulations, accounting for 72 percent. Although the three villages have initially had a comprehensive plan for the mutual aid and cooperation movement and have established a mutual aid and cooperation network, most of the exchanges in the mutual aid and cooperation network are about the experience of agricultural production cooperatives, and how agricultural production cooperatives drive mutual aid teams and cooperate with mutual aid teams is neglected in the activities of the network. There is a system of contact between agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, but it lacks practical and lively contact content. Grassroots cadres lack patient education and sincere help for mutual aid team members, and they have impatience and crude style in leading the work of mutual aid teams, sometimes even casually satirizing and scolding mutual aid team members.
    Based on these situations, in order to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and comprehensively carry out the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, it is necessary to take measures from many aspects to improve the leadership of mutual aid teams:
    First, it should be recognized that issues related to the vital economic interests of members within agricultural production cooperatives are not only internal issues but also directly affect the ideological emotions of the masses outside the cooperatives. Therefore, to improve the work of mutual aid teams and consolidate the organization of mutual aid teams, it is necessary to widely publicize the situation of correctly handling the economic interests within agricultural production cooperatives to the masses outside the cooperatives while rectifying agricultural production cooperatives, and comprehensively publicize the voluntary and mutually beneficial principles and steps of establishing cooperatives. The impractical plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives should be revised and a comprehensive plan should be re-made.
    Second, the content of contact should be enriched and formalism should be overcome on the basis of establishing a system of contact between cooperatives and teams. Better mutual aid teams should also strengthen contact with general mutual aid teams. In particular, some mutual aid teams that plan to combine to establish cooperatives in the future should strengthen contact in production, support each other, coordinate actions, and do a good job in the production of each season this year, starting now. For mutual aid teams that are too small in scale, they can be helped to carry out joint production in a certain season under the principle of voluntariness. Mutual aid teams that are too weak to carry out production independently should also be persuaded and educated to merge with other suitable teams under the principle of voluntariness.
    Third, efforts should be made to prevent rich peasants from eroding mutual aid teams in disguised form. Village cadres should be made to recognize the nature of rich peasants, grasp their activity patterns under the new situation, and not be deceived or induced by them, so as to ensure the purity of mutual aid teams. It is also necessary to strengthen the education of close unity between poor and middle peasants, so that both poor and middle peasants truly understand the principle of "unity brings mutual benefit, separation brings mutual harm." Then, on this basis, the mutual benefit system of mutual aid teams should be determined according to the specific local conditions. It is necessary to prevent mutual aid teams from "throwing away" households without horses during the busy farming season, and also to prevent the phenomenon of not giving remuneration or giving too little remuneration for using horses.
    Fourth, grassroots cadres should be analyzed the current situation of mutual aid teams, so that they can recognize the importance of strengthening leadership of mutual aid teams for completing the production increase plan and further developing the cooperativization movement in the future; and recognize that the problems of mutual aid teams this year are more complex than in any previous year, so they must use new viewpoints and new methods to understand and solve the problems existing within mutual aid teams.

　　今年互助组的新情况和新问题
    ——讷河县平房、双泉、五福三个村互助组情况调查
    编者按：农业合作化运动的发展，不但吸引许多农民加入了农业生产合作社，并且在社外农民群众中间引起了很大的变化。黑龙江省委农村工作部为了加强对互助合作运动的领导，派出张殿举、傅雁龙、郝景民、孙荣胜等同志，在合作化程度不同的三个村，对互助组发生的变化和存在的问题，进行了比较深入的调查。这里发表的就是他们的调查报告。这些调查材料，对于了解当前互助组的情况和改进对互助合作运动的领导是有帮助的。
    黑龙江省讷河县平房、双泉、五福三个村的农业合作组织今年都有了很大的发展。平房村有十个农业生产合作社，参加的农户占总户数百分之六十七；双泉村有八个农业生产合作社，参加的农户占总户数的百分之四十九；五福村有四个农业生产合作社，参加的农户占总户数的百分之二十七。三个村的社外农户占总农户的百分之五十七；劳动力占总数的百分之四十九点三；耕畜占百分之四十五点三；土地：旱田占百分之四十二点七，水田占百分之五十三点四。这些农户共组成了六十一个互助组。
    今年春季农业生产合作社广泛发展以后，引起了一系列的变化：
    一、思想变化：农业合作化运动的影响，已波及农村每个阶层。何去何从，已成为农村舆论的中心。
    这三个村的社外贫农共二百六十五户。贫农绝大多数一心向往合作化，积极主张“搞好互助组，创造条件，争取建社”。双泉村张喜贵互助组原来没马的六户贫农，为了争取今秋建社，在备耕中都买了马匹。他们听到谁说合作社坏话，就和谁进行辩论，并且积极揭发富农分子破坏互助合作运动的行为。但是他们对现有的农业生产合作社也有某些不满和顾虑。他们对农业生产合作社按劳动力平均投资很不满。（双泉村今年新建的六个社，几乎都是按劳动力拿籽种草料的。）他们还看到农业生产合作社目前经营范围狭窄，生产内容单纯，不能充分发挥各种劳动力的作用，因之担心入社后没活干，影响自己生活。此外，也有个别“跑腿子”因过惯游动生活而不愿入社，怕受拘束。
      这三个村在社外的中农共三十二户。他们的态度，因各村合作化发展的情况不同，各个社处理生产资料的办法不同，而各有差异。合作化比重小的村，中农存在尽量“往后拖”的情绪，在生产上维持现状，想“再看一看”，并且说“在外边松快”。在合作化比重大的村，中农普遍存在着“赶快打家底”的情绪。他们“打家底”的做法是：用粗放的耕作方法，尽量多种地和多种植价格高的作物。平房村五个社过早地取消了土地报酬，别的生产资料评价也过低，社外农户就不愿很好地侍弄土地和购买生产资料。西平屯中农孙庆云每年都攒四、五垧地的粪，今年只有三垧地的粪。还有个别户不好好生产，大吃大喝。有八户卖掉了十四垧土地。他们说：在社外没多大逛荡头了。双泉村的农业生产合作社对土地和别的生产资料处理得比较稳妥，社外农民生产情绪就比较正常，攒粪送粪和购置生产资料都比较积极。他们反映：买生产资料现在可以用来搞好自己的生产，将来入社也不吃亏。
    个别资本主义倾向严重的富裕户，对合作化运动的态度是消极抵抗和积极挣脱限制。他们变卖生产资料，抽逃生产资金，组织假社假组。例如双泉村刘永和把十一垧多地和三匹马全部卖掉和典出，五福村杨福田把七头牛全都卖掉。他们声言：这样做将来入社“俐索”，“省得归公”。平房村新富农王生笼络了七户地主富农和被开除了党籍的人和一些被欺骗的农民办假社；被揭发了以后，他又到落后屯去搞假互助组。双泉村施乃才看到本屯新移来了十二户农民，就千方百计阻碍他们建立互助组，企图拉拢他们组织假互助组。还有人把家搬到落后屯去，以便进行剥削活动。
    二、组织变动：不少互助组由于建社时抽走了骨干和部分农民出组入社，成员变动很大。据三个村六十一个互助组的统计，新由零散户凑起来的有十六个组，成员变动一半的有三十个组，基本没变动的只有十五个。这种变化，为今年巩固和提高互助组带来许多新的问题：
    互助组规模缩小了，不利于改进技术。这三个村的互助组当中，三户至五户的有二十一个组，六户至十户的三十三个，十户以上的只有七个。十户以上的多是准备一九五六年建社的组，马力强，人手齐，底子厚，生产好，情绪高。六户到十户的组有不少是所谓“强找强”的“富裕组”，他们一般的不缺生产资料，但是缺乏劳动力；有的虽然也吸收了贫困户，但贫困户顾虑富裕户利用不着时把他们“甩”出去。三户到五户的大部分是“贫农组”，马力弱，人手缺，底子薄，生产有困难，情绪不高。
    组员经济地位相差很大，出现了“剩两头”（特别富裕的和特别贫困的没有入社）的现象；有些组的成分很复杂。这种情况在合作化比重小的村还不明显，比重大的村就特别突出。平房村赵玉岐互助组十二户中有七户是富裕中农，五户是地少、马瘦的贫农。贫农情绪不高，在组内生产没有信心。宋殿清说：“入社拿不起投资，活也干不了；在这个组吧，人家（指富裕户）又不找我开会。我真没路可走了。”有些互助组里还有地主富农和被管制分子。在这种新情况下，在互助组内贯彻阶级政策的工作就更加复杂困难了。
    互助组缺乏领导骨干。多数党员和积极分子已经入社，在社外的党员和积极分子又集中在准备一九五六年建社的一些组内。三个村共有党员六十九名，在互助组的八名，占百分之十一点六；团员一百一十二名，在互助组的二十八名，占百分之二十五。现有组长的情况是：当过两年组长的二十七名，占百分之四十四点三；刚才当组长的三十四名，占百分之五十五点七。其中积极公道能干的十九名，占百分之三十一点二；能干但处事有些不公的十一名，占百分之十八；不积极的三十一名，占百分之五十点八。在合作化程度高的村，不少互助组长说：组长没啥当头了，互助组越搞越缩，越搞越难搞。
    三、领导问题：许多基层干部，对合作化运动的发展所带来的新情况新问题认识不足，不善于解决目前互助组的新问题。许多人有“宁垮十个组，不垮一个社”的思想。因此，当前多数互助组的生产进行得不好。这三个村没有任何生产计划的互助组有四十五个，占互助组总数的百分之七十以上。从互利制度上看，有明确规定的组十七个，占百分之二十八；没有规定的四十四个，占百分之七十二。虽然三个村初步有了互助合作运动的全面规划，并且建立了互助合作网；但是，在互助合作网里多是交流农业生产合作社工作方面的经验，至于农业生产合作社如何带动互助组，如何和互助组合作，在网的活动中是被忽视了的。农业生产合作社和互助组的联系制度是有的，可是却缺乏切实的生动的联系内容。基层干部对互助组员缺乏耐心的教育和诚恳的帮助，在领导互助组的工作中有急躁情绪和粗暴作风，有时甚至随意讽刺和谩骂互助组员。
    根据这些情况，要充分发挥广大农民群众的生产积极性，全面地开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，必须从多方面采取措施改进对互助组的领导工作：
    第一、应当认清，农业生产合作社内有关社员切身经济利益的问题，不只是社内的问题，而且是直接影响到社外群众的思想情绪的问题。因此，要改进互助组的工作，巩固互助组的组织，必须在整顿农业生产合作社的同时，把正确处理农业生产合作社内部的经济利益问题的情况向社外群众广泛宣传，全面地宣传建社的自愿互利原则和步骤。对于不切实际的发展农业生产合作社的计划，应当加以修正，重新作出全面规划。
    第二、应当在建立了社组联系制度的基础上，充实联系的内容，克服形式主义。比较好的互助组也应加强同一般互助组的联系。特别是计划将来合组建社的一些互助组，应当从现在起就在生产上加强联系，互相支援，协同动作，搞好今年各个季节的生产。对于规模过小的互助组，可以帮助它们在自愿原则下在一定季节进行联合生产。对于力量太弱难以单独进行生产的互助组，也应经过说服教育，在自愿原则下和别的适当的组合并。
    第三、应当尽力防止富农变相地侵蚀互助组。要使村干部认清富农的本质，掌握他们在新形势下的活动规律，不受他们的欺骗引诱，保证互助组的纯洁。还必须加强贫农中农密切团结的教育，使贫农和中农都确实了解“合则两利，离则两伤”的道理。然后，在这基础上，根据当地具体情况，确定互助组的互利制度。要防止在农忙时互助组“甩”无马户，也要防止用马不给报酬或报酬太低的现象。
    第四、应当向基层干部分析目前互助组的状况，使他们认识到对互助组加强领导对于完成增产计划和今后进一步发展合作化运动的重要；并且认识到今年互助组的问题比过去任何一年都更加复杂，因此必须用新的观点、新的办法来认识和解决互助组内部所存在的问题。
