　　We Labor to Consolidate Peace and Build Communism
　　Nikolai Kuzmin, Stalin Prize Laureate, Turner at the "Red Proletarian" Factory in Moscow
    In the vast and magnificent Soviet Union, a surge of peaceful, constructive labor is underway. The Soviet people are dedicating themselves with full enthusiasm to completing the tasks of the final year of the Second Post-War Five-Year Plan. The fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan will further consolidate the might of the socialist state and further enhance the happiness of the Soviet people.

    By consolidating the might of our socialist state—a reliable pillar of peace—we strengthen the forces of the democratic camp and actively strive to defend and consolidate world peace. This is how we Soviet people understand our responsibility to the nation, our international responsibility to the working people of all countries, and this is how we understand our participation in the struggle against warmongers. The factories and collective farm fields where millions of Soviet people labor are the front lines of our struggle against war and aggression, the front lines of the struggle for communism.

    The Communist Party teaches us not to be complacent with our achievements, to critically assess our successes, overcome difficulties, and advance courageously. Soviet workers abide by this instruction of the Party, constantly fulfilling socialist production and increasing labor productivity. Because, in the final analysis, labor productivity is the decisive condition for the victory of communism.

    We workers of the "Red Proletarian" factory also have our own contributions in the struggle for communism. By mastering all the new and advanced operational methods in our factory and other enterprises in the country, we are increasing the output of various machine tools every year. Products bearing the "Red Proletarian" trademark are not only popular in our country but also abroad.

    The most complex components of machine tools embody the creative ideas and labor of many designers, technicians, and workers.

    In our factory, we vigorously promote not only the advanced experience of our factory's workers but also the advanced experience of workers from other enterprises in the country. Turner Sherizov improved the lathe tool of his teacher, Kolesov, a turner from the Central Volga Factory. He produced seventy-five parts in one shift, while the quota was only twenty-four parts. Working alongside Sherizov is turner Chernov. He completed four times the work stipulated by the task.

    The rationalization proposals and inventions of all the factory's personnel, inter-industry competitions, and the factory's organized skills training classes play a significant role in encouraging workers' initiative. These training classes are led by production innovators, engineers, and technicians.

    I am a turret lathe turner. By adopting the achievements of comrades and improving my own working methods, I completed twenty-four years' worth of quotas in four years and four months of the Five-Year Plan.

    The work of a turner is creative. This work opens up the greatest possibilities for innovation.

    I am very concerned about improving the organization of turner labor. Therefore, I have proposed tasks for the workers several days in advance. This makes it possible to prepare the necessary tools, fixtures, and charts earlier. At first glance, this is an inconspicuous rationalization proposal, but the labor productivity of the turner has doubled as a result. I have also put forward several rationalization proposals and improvement methods, which have also played a good role.

    By participating in the manufacture of molded semi-automatic machines, I and the comrades who worked with me were awarded the title of Stalin Prize Laureates.

    This year, the workers, engineering technicians, and staff of various departments elected me as the Party organizer, and the representatives of the district Party congress elected me as a member of the district Party committee. All the personnel of the "Red Proletarian" factory gave me high trust by electing me as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

    In order to respond to the trust of all the personnel, I guarantee to complete four hundred to four hundred and fifty percent of the task.

    The labor of all the personnel of the "Red Proletarian" factory is only a small part of the creativity of millions of Soviet people who are successfully building communism and actively fighting for world peace.

　　我们为巩固和平，为建设共产主义而劳动
　　莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂旋工斯大林奖金获得者　尼·库兹明
    在伟大辽阔的苏维埃国家里，沸腾着和平的建设性劳动热潮。苏联人民正怀着满腔热忱来完成第二个战后五年计划最后一年的任务。五年计划的任务的完成，将更加巩固社会主义国家的威力，更加增进苏联人民的幸福。
    我们巩固着我们社会主义国家——和平的可靠支柱——的威力，从而增强民主阵营的力量，并积极地为保卫和巩固世界和平而斗争。我们苏联人就是这样来理解自己对国家所负的责任，自己对所有国家的劳动人民所负的国际责任的，我们就是这样来理解我们所参加的反对战争贩子的斗争的。千百万苏联人在那儿劳动的工厂和集体农庄的田野，这就是我们反对战争和侵略斗争的前线，就是争取共产主义斗争的前线。
    共产党教导我们不要满足于已得的成就，要批判地估计自己的成绩，克服困难，勇敢前进。苏联工人遵守着党的这个指示，不断地完成社会主义的生产，提高劳动生产率。因为，劳动生产率，归根到底是共产主义胜利的决定性条件。
    我们“红色无产者”工厂工人在争取共产主义的斗争中也有自己的贡献。由于在我们工厂和国内其他企业中掌握了一切新的、先进的操作法，我们每年都在增加各种机床的产量。带有“红色无产者”商标的产品不仅在我们国内受到欢迎，而且在国外也受到欢迎。
    在机床的最复杂的构件中，体现出许多设计师、技师和工人的创造性的思想和劳动。
    在我们工厂里不仅大力推广本厂工人的先进经验，而且也在大力推广国内其他企业工人的先进经验。旋工谢里佐夫改善了他的老师——中伏尔加工厂的旋工科列索夫的车刀，他在一个班的时间内制造出七十五个零件，而定额只二十四个零件。和谢里佐夫并排工作的有旋工契尔诺夫。他完成了任务所规定的四倍的工作。
    工厂全体人员的合理化建议和发明，各行业之间的竞赛，以及工厂组织的提高技艺能力的训练班、在鼓励工人的主动精神方面起着重大的作用，领导这些训练班的有生产革新者、工程师和技师。
    我是一个转塔车床旋工。由于采用同志们的成就和自己改善了工作方法，我在五年计划的四年零四个月就完成了二十四年的定额。
    旋工的工作是创造性的。这个工作为革新开辟了最大的可能性。
    我很关心旋工劳动组织的改善，因此我曾向工人提出几天以后的任务。这就可能更早一些准备必要的工具、卡具和图表。骤然看起来这是一个不大起眼的合理化建议，可是旋工的劳动生产率却因此提高了一倍。我还提出了几个合理化建议和改善的方法，这些建议和方法也都起了良好的作用。
    由于参加制造模制半自动机，我和我一起工作的同志都获得了斯大林奖金的获得者的称号。
    今年，工人、工程技术人员和各部门的职员把我选为党的组织员，区的党代表会议的代表选我为党的区委会委员。“红色无产者”工厂的全体人员给了我高度的信任，把我选为俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国最高苏维埃的代表。
    为了回答全体人员的信任，我保证完成任务的百分之四百到四百五十。
    “红色无产者”工厂全体人员的劳动，只是顺利建设共产主义，积极为全世界和平而战斗的千百万苏联人的创造力的一小部分。
