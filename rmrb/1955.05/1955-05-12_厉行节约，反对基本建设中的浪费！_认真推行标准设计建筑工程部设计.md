　　Vigorously Practice Thrift, Oppose Waste in Basic Construction!
　　Conscientiously Promote Standard Design by the Ministry of Construction Engineering

    Implementing standardized design is a crucial link in the comprehensive reform to gradually transform China's construction industry from backward handicraft production to industrialization. Soviet experience tells us that to increase construction speed, improve construction quality, reduce construction costs, and shorten construction periods, we must implement construction industrialization—namely, component prefabrication, material factory production, and construction mechanization. And to achieve construction industrialization, the first thing to solve is the issue of standardized design.

    The so-called standardized design includes the following contents:

    First, determine the standard dimensions for design. Currently, countries like the Soviet Union use ten centimeters as the basic module. All building lengths, heights, widths, door and window sizes, component sizes, etc., are uniformly required to be expressed using the basic module or its multiples. It is not permissible for each person to design a different size, resulting in a wide variety of complex designs that factories cannot mass-produce.

    Second, standardize the specifications and dimensions of building materials. This regulation will avoid the current situation where material dimensions are not uniform across regions, various material sizes do not match, and designed dimensions do not conform to the dimensions of material supply, resulting in waste due to using long materials for short applications and large materials for small applications.

    Third, formulate standard building components and standard detailed drawings. Currently, for the same type of component, each design unit designs independently, without exchanging experiences or information. As a result, components are designed very complexly, which hinders the promotion of "material factory production" and wastes design resources. For example, the Beijing Guanghua Wood Factory could only produce furniture and toys in the past during the winter. When component design drawings came out, they had to rush processing, making production very uneven. In addition, the variety of doors and windows was too large to allow for mass production, so the annual output was only 50,000 sets. If standard doors and windows were implemented, the annual output of this factory could be increased to 150,000 sets, an increase in production value of about 3 million yuan from this item alone. At the same time, if components have detailed drawings, the design time can be shortened by 25 to 30 percent, which can greatly help improve the current situation where design cannot keep up with construction.

    With these prerequisites, standard building designs can be developed. The so-called standard design is a standardized design based on standard design dimensions, material specifications, national economic and technical conditions, and quota indicators. For example, standard dormitories, schools, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. There are many benefits to using standard designs.

    First of all, the use of standard designs will effectively guarantee project quality. From the design point of view, because the standard design has undergone many repeated comparisons and implements the advanced experience already mastered, it largely meets the requirements of applicability, economy, and, where possible, aesthetics. From the construction point of view, standard design creates conditions for material factory production and construction mechanization, making it possible to replace handicraft construction methods with modern construction methods on a large scale, which obviously plays a significant role in ensuring project quality.

    Secondly, using standard designs can also shorten construction time. One of the biggest difficulties currently felt by construction units is the lack of sufficient drawing reserves, which prevents them from properly arranging construction plans and preparing for construction work. If standard designs are used, design units only need to do foundation design and overall planning, shortening the design time, and thus eliminating or reducing the phenomenon of work stoppages waiting for drawings. Construction units can prepare materials in advance based on standard designs, place orders with processing plants, and do construction organization design. With such preparation, it is estimated that the start date can be advanced by twenty days to a month, and at the same time, the waste caused by lack of sufficient preparation can be overcome. Due to the prefabrication of components, on-site operations can be minimized, becoming on-site assembly, and the construction period can be greatly shortened.

    Using standard designs can also reduce project costs. Prefabricated components produced in factories can reduce the waste of raw materials and losses caused by open-air storage, as well as save on the consumption of shoring and templates. Mechanized construction can improve working conditions and increase labor productivity, and production can continue in the rainy season and winter. Processing plants can carry out production in a planned and balanced manner, and can reduce waste, avoiding the waste of using large materials for small applications and long materials for short applications. At the same time, the use of standard designs also facilitates the statistics of material requirements and their specifications, creating conditions for improving the planning of material production and supply, reducing material stockpiles, and reducing the occurrence of work stoppages due to lack of materials during construction.

    Using standard designs can also save design resources. According to past design tasks, about 60 percent of the total annual tasks, such as dormitories, schools, and canteens, can use standard designs. Assuming that the annual task is 30 million square meters of building area, then 18 million square meters can use standard designs. And this 18 million square meters of building can be solved with about 800,000 square meters of standard design drawings. This saves over 17 million square meters of design resources. Of course, foundation design and overall layout will also require some effort, but this workload will not exceed one-fifth. At the very least, there is no doubt that 14 million square meters of design resources can be saved. If an average designer can complete 3,600 square meters of design per year, then the saved design resources will be equal to the workload of four thousand people working for a year.

    Although promoting standard design has so many benefits, to date, not many have adopted standard designs and conducted research on design standardization issues. The first reason is that the relevant leading authorities do not pay enough attention to it. For example, although the design institutes under the Ministry of Construction Engineering have all established standard design offices or groups, the strength they are equipped with is relatively weak, and when production is tight, the staff of the standard design offices are transferred to other places as "reserve forces." Another example is that in 1953, under the repeated urging of experts, the Beijing Design Institute spent two months intensively designing a set of standard door and window design drawings starting in April, but the leadership did not approve it until the end of the year.

    Secondly, there is no unified leadership. Designs made without unified leadership cannot be standard designs. Because they are developed blindly and independently by various design units, without unified area quotas, prescribed economic indicators, or uniform design technical conditions as the basis for standard design, which in fact forms a variety of separate designs, losing the meaning of standard design. Due to the lack of unified leadership, the amount of national investment is difficult to control, which will waste state funds and create adverse political effects. For example, the construction units in Taiyuan, because they are directly under different administrative leadership organs, have large differences in the cost of building dormitories in the same city, ranging from 70 yuan to 140 yuan per square meter. Some factory dormitory designs are of too high quality, and the rent is too expensive. No one wants to live in the dormitories that have been built. This situation of being out of touch with reality is no longer isolated.

    Adopting standard design and implementing design standardization is not only urgently needed for our country, but also possible. The Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a design and construction work conference in February, summarized past experiences, and immediately took the following measures after the meeting:

    First, it researched and formulated unified design area quotas, economic indicators, and quality standards for various buildings in residential areas (such as dormitories, canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, etc.), providing a basis for future standard designs.

    Second, it researched and proposed the basic modular unit for building design that can be adopted in our country at present, creating the necessary conditions for design standardization.

    Third, it compiled the necessary standard building components, such as doors and windows, prefabricated beams and slabs, stairs, roof panels, etc., for design units to widely adopt, overcoming the past phenomenon of non-uniform components and creating favorable conditions for gradually realizing construction industrialization. After the above prerequisites have been met, the Design General Bureau is currently summarizing past experiences and further arranging standard designs for various buildings in residential areas suitable for different climatic regions, so that the standard design work will be greatly improved on the original basis to meet the needs of national socialist construction.

    Now it can be said that the work of promoting design standardization has initially unfolded in the system of the Ministry of Construction Engineering.

    实行设计标准化，是使我国建筑工业从落后的手工业生产逐步走向工业化的全面改革的重要环节之一。苏联的经验告诉我们，要提高建筑速度，提高建筑质量，降低建筑成本，缩短建筑工期，就必须实行建筑工业化——即构件装配化、材料工厂化和施工机械化。而要实现建筑工业化，首先就要解决设计标准化的问题。
    所谓设计标准化，包括这样几个内容：
    一、确定设计的标准尺寸。现在苏联等国家都采用十公分为基本尺度，所有建筑的长度、高度、宽度、门窗尺寸、构件尺寸等等，都统一规定必须用基本尺度或它的倍数来表示，不允许每个人设计一种尺寸，弄得花样繁多而复杂，使工厂无法大规模生产。
    二、统一建筑材料的规格尺寸。这样规定以后，就可以避免目前所存在的各地区材料尺度不统一，各种材料尺寸不配合，设计的尺寸和材料供应的尺寸不符合，因而造成长材短用、大材小用的浪费现象。
    三、制定标准建筑构件和标准详图。现在同一类型的构件，各个设计单位都在自行设计，而且互不交流经验、互不交换资料。因此把构件设计得十分复杂，既阻碍了“材料工厂化”的推行，又浪费了设计力量。如北京光华木工厂过去每到冬季只能生产家具玩具，等到构件设计图纸出来了，又要突击加工，生产很不均衡；再加上门窗的样式繁多，不能大规模地生产，所以每年的产量仅达五万樘。假如推行了标准门窗，这个工厂的年产量就可提高到十五万樘，单这一项就可增产约三百万元。同时，如果构件都有详图，还可以缩短百分之二十五到三十的设计时间，可以大大有助于改善目前设计赶不上施工的状况。
    有了这些前提条件，就可以编制建筑的标准设计了。所谓标准设计，就是根据设计标准尺寸、材料规格尺度、国家经济技术条件和定额指标而组成的一种定型设计。例如标准宿舍、学校、托儿所、幼儿园等等。采用标准设计，好处是很多的。
    首先，采用标准设计将会有效地保证工程质量。从设计方面来说，因为标准设计经过许多次的反复比较，并贯彻了已经掌握的先进经验，所以是在相当程度上符合适用、经济及在可能条件下照顾美观这一要求的。从施工方面来说，标准设计为材料工厂化、施工机械化创造了条件，使有可能大规模地以现代化的施工方法来代替手工业的施工方法，显然对保证工程质量会起很大的作用。
    其次，利用标准设计还可以缩短建设时间。目前施工单位感到最大的困难之一，是没有足够的图纸储备，因而不能很好地安排施工计划，做好施工前的准备工作。如果使用标准设计，设计单位只需做基础设计和总体规划即可，缩短了设计时间，因此可以消灭或减少停工待图现象。施工单位可以根据标准设计提前备料，向加工厂订货和做施工组织设计。由于有了这样的准备，估计可以把开工日期提前二十天到一个月，同时也可以克服因没有充分准备而造成浪费的现象。由于构件的预制，在施工现场的操作可以尽量减少，变为现场装配，施工的工期也可大大地缩短。
    利用标准设计，还可以降低工程造价。预制构件在工厂生产，可以减少原材料的浪费和露天堆置所造成的损耗，还可以节省撑木和模板的损耗。机械化施工可以改进劳动条件，提高劳动生产率，可以在雨季和冬季继续进行生产。加工厂可以通过计划均衡地进行生产，并可减少废料，避免大材小用、长材短用的浪费。同时，采用标准设计，又便于统计材料需用量及其规格，给提高材料生产及供应的计划性创造了条件，可以减少材料的积压，减少施工中发生停工待料的情形。
    利用标准设计，还可以节省设计力量。根据以往的设计任务来看，可以采用标准设计的如宿舍、学校、食堂等，约占每年总任务的百分之六十以上。假定一年的任务是三千万平方公尺的建筑面积，那么，就有一千八百万平方公尺可以采用标准设计。而这一千八百万平方公尺的建筑，用约八十万平方公尺的标准设计图就可以解决。这样就节约了一千七百多万平方公尺的设计力量。当然基础设计和总体布置还要花费一些力量，但这些工作量是不会超过五分之一的。从最低限度上来说，节省一千四百万平方公尺的设计力量是没有疑问的。假使平均每个设计人员一年能完成三千六百平方公尺的设计，那么所节约的设计力量将等于四千个人做一年时间的工作量。
    推行标准设计虽然有这么多好处，但到目前为止，采用标准设计和进行设计标准化问题研究的却不多。其原因首先是有关的领导机关不重视。例如建筑工程部所属各设计院虽都成立了标准设计室或组，但是所配备的力量较差，并且遇到生产紧张的时候，又把标准设计室的工作人员作为“后备力量”抽调到别处去了。又如一九五三年北京设计院在专家的一再督促下，从四月份开始，以二个月时间突击设计了一套标准门窗设计图，但领导方面直到年底才批了下来。
    其次是没有统一领导。没有统一领导做出来的设计，就不可能是标准设计。因为它是各设计单位盲目地各自为政地搞出来的，既无统一的面积定额，又无规定的经济指标，更没有划一的设计技术条件作为标准设计的根据，以致在事实上形成了各种各样的单独设计，失去了标准设计的意义。由于没有统一领导，国家投资数额就很难控制，就会浪费国家资金并造成政治上的不良影响。例如太原的各建设单位，因为直属行政领导机关的不同，所以在同一城市内修建宿舍的造价差别很大，每平方公尺有低到七十元的，也有高到一百四十元的。有些工厂宿舍设计质量过高，租金太贵，宿舍盖了没人愿意住，这种脱离现实的情况已经不是个别的了。
    采用标准设计和实行设计标准化，对我国来说，不仅是迫切需要的，并且也是有可能的。建筑工程部在二月召开了设计及施工工作会议，总结了以往的经验，并在会后立即采取了下列的一些措施：
    一、研究并拟订了住宅区各项建筑（如宿舍、食堂、托儿所、幼儿院、中小学等）的统一的设计面积定额、经济指标和质量标准，使今后标准设计有了依据。
    二、研究并提出了我国目前可以采用的建筑设计的基本尺度单位，为设计标准化创造了必要的条件。
    三、编制了必要的建筑标准构件，如门窗、预制梁板、楼梯、屋面板等，供设计单位广泛采用，克服过去构件不统一的现象，并为逐步实现建筑工业化创造有利的条件。在已经具备了以上的先决条件之后，目前设计总局总结了过去的经验，进一步布置了适合不同气候区域的住宅区各项建筑物的标准设计，使标准设计工作在原有的基础上大大地提高一步，以适应国家社会主义建设的需要。
    现在可以说，推行设计标准化的工作，已经在建筑工程部系统初步展开了。
