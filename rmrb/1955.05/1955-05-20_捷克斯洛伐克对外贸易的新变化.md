The rapid development of Czechoslovakia's socialist industrialization in the ten years since its liberation has brought about great changes in its foreign trade. Currently, four-fifths of Czechoslovakia's total exports are manufactured goods. There is a great variety of manufactured goods for export, including giant machine tools, complete sets of basic construction equipment, power stations, glass and consumer goods industrial equipment, automobiles, cranes, river vessels, travel and training aircraft, motorcycles, tractors and other agricultural machinery, textiles, footwear, rubber industrial products, radios and other consumer goods, etc.

One of the biggest changes in Czechoslovakia's exports since liberation has been the rapid increase in machinery manufacturing products. In 1937, before liberation, Czechoslovakia's exports of machinery and equipment accounted for only 7.4 percent of the country's total exports, but by 1953, they accounted for 40 percent.

Czechoslovakia's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies accounts for the largest proportion of its total foreign trade. In 1954, its volume of trade with these countries increased by anything from double to ten times compared to 1948. Czechoslovakia has also expanded its trade with capitalist countries. By the end of 1954, it had established trade links with more than seventy capitalist countries.

　  捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的新变化
    捷克斯洛伐克解放十年来在社会主义工业化方面的迅速发展，使它的对外贸易发生了很大变化。目前，捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的输出总额中有五分之四是制成品。出口的制成品的种类很多，其中包括巨型工作母机、成套的基本建设设备、发电站、玻璃和消费品工业设备、汽车、起重机、内河船只、旅行和教练用的飞机、机器脚踏车、拖拉机和其他农业机器、纺织品、鞋类、橡胶工业制品、收音机和其他消费品等。
    解放以来捷克斯洛伐克出口中的最大变化之一是机器制造业产品的迅速增加。在解放前的一九三七年，捷克斯洛伐克出口的机器设备仅占全国总输出额的百分之七点四，但到一九五三年就占百分之四十。
    捷克斯洛伐克同苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，在它的整个对外贸易中占最大的比重。一九五四年它同这些国家的换货量比一九四八年增加了一倍到十倍不等。捷克斯洛伐克同资本主义国家的贸易也扩大了。到一九五四年年底，同它建立贸易联系的资本主义国家有七十多个。
