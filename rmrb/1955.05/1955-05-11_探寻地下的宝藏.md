　　Exploring Underground Treasures
　　Yi Liewu, Gao Zhenxiang
    The train sped into the Zixing mining area. Rolling hills stretched for dozens of miles along the route. From the train windows, dozens of newly opened mountain roads crisscrossed the landscape, and drilling rigs stood tall between the peaks, appearing as scattered white dots from afar. This was the area where the Zixing Exploration Team of the Central South Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau worked day and night.

    This exploration team was formed by assembling drilling units from exploration teams in Zibo, Shandong; Xinwen, Jiangsu; and Pingxiang, Jiangxi.

    In June of last year, this exploration team, carrying two to three tons of equipment on their shoulders, climbed mountains and crossed ridges to set up tents and install drilling rigs here. During the day, they could hear the roars of tigers. At night, when carbide lamps lit up the drilling towers, snakes even crawled up the towers. The scorching summer had just passed, and the high mountains were shrouded in dense fog that lingered all day long. When the harsh winter arrived, thick layers of ice formed on the slopes, and strong winds carrying fine snow swept in from the top of the towers and through the doorways. Although the stoves were lit in the tents, it was still unbearably cold.

    However, none of these difficulties stopped the workers from exploring underground resources for the motherland. The workers said, "We are the vanguards of national construction. Without difficulties, there is no glory!" When the drilling rigs were first moved in, and there were no roads to be found on the mountain, they held sickles, cut through thorns and brambles, and opened up transportation arteries stretching over 120 kilometers; when the mountains were sealed by ice and snow, and the supply of equipment and provisions was difficult, they wrapped straw ropes around their feet, taking one slippery step at a time, always ensuring the normal operation of the drilling rigs.

    On December 26th of last year, heavy snow was falling when technician Zhou Xiaosheng, who was working on a certain peak, received bad news over the phone: a drilling accident had occurred at drilling site No. 1 on Line 3, and the drill rod was stuck in the rock formation and could not be pulled up. Zhou Xiaosheng, a Communist Party member from a working-class background, did not hesitate at all. He stepped on three or four inches of ice and hurried towards drilling site No. 1 on Line 3, one slippery step at a time. He traveled over twenty miles, from early morning to 3 p.m. His underwear was soaked with sweat, his outer clothing was frozen stiff, and his stomach was growling with hunger, but he forgot all of this and arrived at the drilling tower. The workers were discussing the situation, advocating the use of a jack to remove the drill rod. Zhou Xiaosheng calculated that this would take at least ten days, and if the drill rod broke, the entire borehole would be in danger of being scrapped. At this time, he thought of the advanced Soviet experience in handling oil spill accidents and decided to follow this advanced experience. On January 1st, when people were sitting around the stove chatting and laughing, celebrating New Year's Day, Zhou Xiaosheng and the workers worked for four days and four nights and finally eliminated the accident, allowing the drill rod to continue to penetrate into the heart of the stratum.

    There is a young female geological worker named Li Bingqin. More than a year ago, when she had just finished junior high school and was assigned to the Zibo Exploration Team in Shandong, she was not very settled. She wanted to continue her studies and missed her home. But now, after living in this exploration team for some time, she has become very active. In addition to drawing geological charts indoors, whenever she has free time, she climbs mountains and crosses ridges like her male comrades, looking at the terrain and finding observation points, climbing ten or twenty miles a day. Her feet are blistered, but it doesn't seem to matter to her.

    Zhao Youxiao, who was recently promoted from recorder to deputy captain of the drilling rig, was a rural work cadre in Shandong a year ago. In those years of working in the countryside, he often promoted industrialization and tractors to the peasants... He said it in his mouth, but in his heart he was longing: when would he be able to join the "vanguard" team of industrial construction! In March of last year, his wish came true. After more than half a year of hard study, in October he was promoted to serve as deputy captain on a drilling rig. This drilling rig originally had the most accidents and the lowest efficiency. After he arrived, he united everyone and promoted the advanced Soviet experience - steel grit drilling. By March, the drilling rig he led had drilled 348 meters in 23 days, setting a new record for the entire team, nearly five times higher than the efficiency before October of last year.

    Now this exploration team has completed their first geological report, and the second and third are about to come out. According to these geological data, these dozens of square kilometers of mountains and fields will be built into massive mines. At the same time, the advance team of the exploration team has set off to a new area more than a hundred miles away. There, in the nearly two hundred square kilometers of wilderness, the curtain of a new battle is about to be raised.

　　探寻地下的宝藏
　　易烈武　高振祥
    火车驰进资兴矿区，沿线数十里山岭逶迤，从车厢上遥望过去，数十条新辟的山路纵横罗布，山峰之间，钻塔高耸，远远看去只见白点斑斑。这里，便是中南煤田地质勘探局资兴勘探队日夜出没的地方。
    这支勘探队由山东淄博、江苏新汶、江西萍乡等地勘探队的钻探机群汇集而成。
    去年六月，这支勘探队肩扛了两三吨重的器材，攀山越岭，在这里搭起帐篷、安下钻机的时候，白天都可以听到虎啸的声音。夜晚，当钻塔上燃起电石灯的时候，蛇竟爬上了钻塔。炎热的夏天刚刚消逝，高山峻岭就被终日不散的浓雾笼罩住了。一到严冬，山坡结上了厚厚的冰层，劲风夹着细雪从塔顶和门口卷入，帐房里虽然生起了炉火，还是冷不可当。
    然而所有这些困难都没有挡住工人们去为祖国探寻地下的资源，工人们说：“我们是建设祖国的尖兵，没有困难，就没有光荣！”当钻机刚刚搬来，山上寻不出道路的时候，他们手持镰刀，斩荆披棘，在山上开辟出纵横一百二十余公里的运输大道；当冰雪封山，器材给养供应困难的时候，他们脚捆草绳，爬一步滑一步，始终保证了钻机的正常运转。
    去年十二月二十六日，大雪纷飞，正在某山峰上工作的技术员周孝生从电话中得到一个不好的消息：三线一孔的钻机发生淤钻事故，钻杆卡在岩层中提不上来了。周孝生，这个工人出身的共产党员丝毫没有犹疑，便踏着三四寸厚的冰层，一步一滑地赶紧往三线一孔奔去，从清早赶到下午三时，跋涉二十余里，内衣汗湿了，外衣冻硬了，腹内饿慌了，但他忘了这一切，赶到了钻塔。工人们正在议论纷纷，主张要用千斤顶取出钻杆才能处理。周孝生盘算一下：这样做至少得花十天时间，如果钻杆断了，整个钻孔还有报废的危险。这时候，他想起了苏联关于油排事故的先进经验，并决定按这个先进经验办。一月一日，当人们正在围炉谈笑、欢度元旦的时候，周孝生和工人们经过四天四夜工作，终于排除了事故，把钻杆继续伸向地层的心脏中去了。
    这里有一个年轻的女地质工作者李冰琴，一年多以前刚读完初中被分配到山东淄博勘探队的时候，她还不大安心，又想升学，又想家。可是现在，在这支勘探队中生活了一些时日之后，她变得十分活跃了，除在室内描绘地质图表外，一有空，她就跟男同志一样，穿山越岭，看地形，找观测点，一天爬上一二十里，脚板起了泡，却好像没有那回事似的。
    不久以前才由记录员提升为钻探机副机长的赵友孝，一年以前还是山东一个农村工作干部。在农村工作的那几年，他常常向农民宣传工业化呀，拖拉机呀……。口里这样讲，心里就在向往着：什么时候自己也能到工业建设的“尖兵”队里去呢！去年三月，他的愿望实现了。经过半年多的刻苦学习，十月间就被提拔到一台钻机上担任副机长了。这台钻机原来事故最多，效率最低，他来到之后，团结大家，推广了苏联先进经验——钢粒钻进。到三月份，他所领导的这台钻机在二十三天内钻进了三百四十八公尺，创全队最高纪录，比去年十月份以前的效率提高近五倍。
    现在这支勘探队已经完成了他们的第一个地质报告，第二个、第三个跟着就要出来。根据这些地质资料，这数十平方公里的山野将被建设成一座一座规模巨大的矿井。和这同时，勘探队的先遣队伍又已出发到距这里一百多里外的新区，在那里，在将近两百平方公里的原野上，一场新的战斗的序幕即将揭开。
