    新华社雅加达十日电　由于美蒋特务的破坏而失事的印度飞机“克什米尔公主号”的残骸已分批运到雅加达港口，以便进行进一步调查。负责调查这一事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会在飞机失事地点纳土纳群岛停留一周后，已在五月七日返回雅加达。
    印度尼西亚调查委员会的主席是印度尼西亚民用航空局空运处处长伊马汪。委员有：印度尼西亚民用航空局技术处副处长苏托莫，该局工作人员希林格斯（荷兰人）和印度尼西亚鹰航空公司工作人员孔敏哈（荷兰人）。
    参加调查的还有：印度驻印度尼西亚大使馆武官米特拉，印度民用航空局副局长拉哈和两名印度技术顾问：印度政府的事件稽查主任伊·鲁·马洛特拉和印度国际航空公司的稽查主任阿普斯瓦米。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆武官茅琛和领事黎笑村也应印度尼西亚政府的邀请作为观察员去了纳土纳群岛。
    委员会在五月一日到达纳土纳群岛。印度尼西亚打捞船“特里顿号”在四月二十八日就已经到了那里。在这以前，英国打捞船“巴尔弗号”已经到达，并且已于四月二十五日开始打捞工作。在印度尼西亚打捞船到达的时候，英国船只的打捞工作已经差不多结束了。
    据参加过在纳土纳群岛进行的调查工作后回来的人员说，“克什米尔公主号”的大部分残骸已经打捞起来，但是机尾没有找到。在当地的调查过程中，除了德·克·贾塔尔上尉的尸体以外，在飞机残骸中没有发现其他遇难者的尸体。
