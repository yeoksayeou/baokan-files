Xinhua News Agency, London, May 1st (TASS): The British Conservative Party's election platform has been published. Considering the sentiments of voters across a wide range of social strata, the Conservative Party pledges to "eliminate the atmosphere of mistrust that poisons East-West relations today." The platform states, "We are now prepared to engage in broader discussions. We will spare no effort to facilitate a meeting with Soviet leaders and strive to reach agreement at the negotiating table on proposals that will achieve new progress in disarmament and the security of all nations."

However, this platform clearly violates the publicly declared positions of the Conservative Party. It advocates a "policy of strength," promoting the atomic arms race and the militarization of West Germany. As everyone knows, this is precisely the policy that leads to the worsening of international tensions and the escalation of the threat of war.

Violating the interests of strengthening peace and security in the Far East, the Conservatives, in their platform regarding the Far East, disregard the indisputable right of the People's Republic of China to Taiwan.

The platform reflects British concerns about the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It states that the Conservatives also intend to participate in the implementation of military plans in these regions in the future.

In the domestic policy section of the platform, the Conservative Party "reaffirms its confidence in free competitive enterprise and opposes any further nationalization of industry." The platform also promises voters to raise their living standards.

The British bourgeois press supports this platform. However, "The Times" said: This platform "is a concoction of arbitrarily applied clichés, sensational words, and cautious reservations, offering plenty of verbiage and very little substance."

The "Daily Worker" said: This platform "is like a fraudulent company scheme designed to deceive those who are easily fooled."

　　英国保守党发表竞选纲领
    新华社二日讯　据塔斯社伦敦一日讯：英国保守党的竞选纲领已经公布。保守党考虑到广泛阶层的选民的心情，就保证要设法“消除今天毒化着东西方之间的气氛的不信任心理”。纲领说，“我们现在准备进行比较广泛的讨论。我们将不遗余力地促成同苏联领袖们的会议，并且设法在会议桌上就将在裁减军备和一切国家人民的安全方面获得新进展的建议达成协议。”
    但是，这个纲领显然违反了保守党公开宣布的主张。它鼓吹“实力政策”，鼓吹原子军备竞赛和西德军国主义化。而大家知道，这正是导致国际紧张局势的恶化和战争威胁加剧的政策。
    违反加强远东和平和安全的利益的保守党人，在他们的关于远东的纲领中无视了中华人民共和国对台湾的无可辩驳的权利。
    这个纲领反映出英国对中东和东南亚的关心。它说，保守党人也打算在将来参予这些地区的军事计划的执行。
    保守党在纲领的国内政策部分中“重申了它对自由竞争企业的信心，并且反对工业的任何进一步国有化”。纲领还答应选民们要提高生活水平。
    英国资产阶级报纸都支持这个纲领。可是“泰晤士报”说：这个纲领“是任意应用陈言滥调、耸人听闻的字眼和谨慎的保留条件拼凑起来的，它提供了极多的辞藻和极少的纲领”。
      “工人日报”说：这个纲领“像一个为了骗那些容易上当的人而拟定的骗人的公司计划”。
