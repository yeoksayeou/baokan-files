　　Mr. Domnitsky, head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, also went to Yokohama port to see them off.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th. At 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, Lei Renmin, head of the Chinese trade delegation to Japan, met with Japanese reporters at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo before returning home and made the following statement to the Japanese press:

　　The Chinese trade delegation to Japan has conducted visits, tours, and discussions, and signed a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement during its 30-plus day visit to your country. Now that we have completed this meaningful visit, we are about to embark on our journey home. During our visit to your country, we have been warmly welcomed and received by the people and people from all walks of life in your country, and have received your deep concern and support. As we are about to leave your country, on behalf of all members of our delegation, I would like to extend our heartfelt and deep gratitude to our hosts: Mr. Murata Shozo, Mr. Ikeda Masanosuke, and the staff of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, as well as the people and people from all walks of life in your country.

　　During our visit to your country, with the friendly cooperation and support of the people and people from all walks of life in your country, we had the opportunity to extensively exchange views with people from all walks of life in your country on the development of trade relations between the two countries, and visited many factories and commodity exhibitions, which enabled us to better understand each other's supply and demand, which will be beneficial to the development of trade in the future. In particular, the strong desire of the people and people from all walks of life in your country to develop trade between China and Japan, restore normal trade relations between the two countries, and normalize relations between the two countries, and the profound friendship of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people, have left a deep impression on us. We must take the friendship of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people back and convey it to the Chinese people.

　　The new trade agreement we have signed has a positive significance for the development of normal trade relations between China and Japan. The various provisions in the agreement are precisely the problems that urgently need to be solved for the current development of normal trade between China and Japan. If the various provisions in the agreement are fully realized, it is believed that trade between China and Japan will be greatly developed. Therefore, this Sino-Japanese trade negotiation has been fruitful.

　　After the agreement is signed, the responsibility of both parties lies in actively and responsibly implementing the various provisions in the agreement so that the agreement can be fully realized. Therefore, greater efforts must be continued. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that it is still difficult to rely solely on the efforts of the two parties signing the agreement and the people of the two countries, and the governments of both parties must take a positive and responsible attitude towards the agreement signed this time, and take effective measures to provide support and assistance so that the agreement can be fully realized. This is the key to Sino-Japanese trade.

　　The trade relationship between China and Japan has a long history, and there are a large number of commodities that both parties can exchange. From our visits and discussions this time, this fact has been further confirmed. China and Japan are very close, transportation is convenient, we are familiar with each other's supply and demand, and the development of trade between the two countries is the common wish and requirement of the people of both countries. Therefore, trade between China and Japan has full conditions for development. The future of trade is very broad.

　　During our negotiations on the trade agreement, we also conducted specific transaction discussions with business people from your country and have agreed on some long-term supply contracts and reservation contracts. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to conduct more specific transactions. We are willing to maintain close contact with business people from your country.

　　Finally, I would like to express my gratitude once again to the Japanese people, people from all walks of life, and our hosts.

　　This is also my farewell statement.

　　我贸易代表团结束在日本访问离横滨回国
　  雷任民在回国前向日本报界发表谈话
　　新华社东京六日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团结束了在日本的访问后，已在六日中午由横滨港乘轮船返国。
    到横滨港欢送的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表理事池田正之辅，日本众议院副议长杉山元治郎，众议院议员宇田耕一、中村高一、帆足计，参议院议员木下源吾、堀真琴、须藤五郎，日中友好协会副会长内山完造，日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎，日棉实业公司、东京贸易公司、东工物产公司、日商公司、伊藤忠商事公司、东洋棉花公司、第一通商公司等贸易商代表以及华侨人士、横滨中华学校师生等共约一千人。
    苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基也到横滨港欢送。
    新华社东京六日电　六日上午九时，中国访问日本贸易代表团团长雷任民在回国前在东京帝都饭店接见日本记者，向日本报界发表谈话如下：
    中国访问日本贸易代表团在访问贵国的三十多天当中，进行了访问、参观、恳谈，并签订了新的中日贸易协定。现在，我们已经完成了这次有意义的访问，就要启程回国。对于在我们访问贵国期间，贵国人民和各界人士对我们的热烈欢迎和招待，对我们深切的关怀和支持，在我们将要离开贵国的时候，我谨代表我们代表团全体人员向我们的主人：村田省藏先生、池田正之辅先生和日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟两团体的工作人员和贵国人民、各界人士致以衷心的、深切的感谢。
    我们这次访问贵国，在贵国人民和各界人士友好合作和支持下，使我们有机会广泛地和贵国各界人士充分地交换了有关发展两国间贸易关系的意见，参观了不少工厂和商品展览会，使我们更多地了解了彼此的供需情况，这将有益于今后贸易的发展。特别是贵国人民和各界人士对于发展中日两国贸易、恢复两国正常的贸易关系、要求两国关系正常化的强烈愿望，和对于中国人民的深厚友谊，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们一定要把日本人民对中国人民的友谊带回去传达给中国人民。
    我们这次所签订的新的贸易协定，对发展中、日两国之间的正常贸易关系，具有积极意义。协定中的各项规定，正是当前发展中、日两国之间正常贸易所迫切需要解决的问题。如果协定中各项规定获得完满实现，相信中、日两国之间的贸易将会大大发展。因之，这次中日贸易谈判是有收获的。
    在协定签订后，双方的责任就在于积极负责地执行协定中的各项规定，使协定能够圆满地实现。所以就必须继续作更大的努力。同时，还应当指出，仅仅依靠签订协定的双方和两国人民的努力还是有困难的，必须双方政府对这次所签订的协定，以积极负责的态度，采取有效的措施，给予支持和协助，协定才能圆满地实现。这就是中日贸易的关键。
    中日两国的贸易关系，有着长久的历史，双方可以交换的商品是极其众多的。从我们这次的参观和恳谈中，更证实了这一事实。中、日两国距离很近，运输方便，彼此对于供需情况又很熟悉，发展两国之间的贸易又是两国人民的共同愿望和要求。所以，中、日两国的贸易是具备了充分发展的条件的。贸易前途是十分广阔的。
    这次我们在谈判贸易协定的同时，还同贵国工商界进行了具体交易的商谈，已经谈妥了一些长期供应合同和预约合同。因为时间的关系，不可能进行更多的具体的交易，我们愿意和贵国工商界人士继续保持密切联系。
    最后，我要向日本人民、各界人士和我们的主人再一次表示谢意。
    这也就是我的临别的声明。
