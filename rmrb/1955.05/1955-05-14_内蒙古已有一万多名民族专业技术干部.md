　　Over Ten Thousand Ethnic Minority Professionals and Technicians in Inner Mongolia

There are now over ten thousand ethnic minority professionals and technicians working in factories, mines, agricultural and pastoral production fronts, as well as cultural and educational departments in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Many Mongolian veterinarians in the Autonomous Region now serve as chiefs of animal husbandry sections, heads of veterinary stations, or directors of state-owned farms in their banners (counties). In the Greater Khingan Mountains forest region of Inner Mongolia, Mongolian cadres hold positions as directors of forestry industry bureaus, managers of timber companies, engineers, and captains of forest survey teams.

The Autonomous Region has also trained more than 400 water conservancy technicians from various ethnic groups, some of whom have formed water conservancy work teams in pastoral areas. Last year alone, they surveyed and identified nineteen pastures with water sources, capable of accommodating more than 254,000 head of livestock; the constructed irrigation canals not only satisfied the drinking water needs of more than 158,000 head of livestock but also irrigated 14,000 hectares (approximately 210,000 mu) of pastureland.

The Autonomous Region has also trained 1,275 ethnic minority health cadres, including midwives, doctors, and technicians, from Mongolian, Hui, Korean, Manchu, and Oroqen ethnic groups. They are scattered throughout various cities, rural areas, pastoral areas, factories, mines, and forest areas.

　　内蒙古已有一万多名民族专业技术干部
    内蒙古自治区各工厂、矿山和农牧业生产战线上以及文教等部门的民族专业技术干部已有一万多人。自治区许多蒙族兽医人员现在担任着旗的畜牧科长、兽医工作站站长或国营牧场场长。在内蒙古大兴安岭森林地区蒙族干部担任着森林工业局局长、木材公司经理、工程师和森林调查队队长。
    自治区还培养了各族水利技术干部四百多人，其中一部分组成了牧区水利工作队。去年一年就勘查出十九个有水的牧场，能容纳牲畜二十五万四千多头；修建的牧业用水渠，不仅满足了十五万八千多头牲畜的饮水，并可灌溉牧场一万四千垧（每垧十五亩）。
    自治区还培养了蒙、回、朝鲜、满族和鄂伦春等少数民族卫生干部一千二百七十五人，包括助产士、医生和技师。他们散布在各城市、农村、牧区、工厂、矿山和林区。　（据新华社讯）
