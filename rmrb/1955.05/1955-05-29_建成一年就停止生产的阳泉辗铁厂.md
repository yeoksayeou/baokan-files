	The Yangquan Rolling Mill That Stopped Production After Only One Year of Operation
	Jia Yujiang
    In 1952, the local iron ore in the Yangquan City area of Shanxi Province was temporarily unsalable, and the products of the Pinding Iron Plant, directly under the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, also could not find a market. In order to open up the sales of local iron ore in the Yangquan City area, after the "shitan qi chao tie" ("coal gas fried iron" - coal gas ironmaking) experiment at the Pinding Iron Plant and Yangquan Iron Industry Experimental Plant, led by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, proved successful, it was decided to establish a small rolling mill in Yangquan City. This was intended to roll the iron produced by coal gas frying into "shaped" iron that could be used to make agricultural tools. However, before deciding to build the rolling mill, there was no sufficient investigation into the production targets and sources of raw materials, and no careful study of whether the iron smelted in Yangquan and Pinding could be rolled.
    Zhao Rong, the deputy director in charge of preparing for the construction of the factory, was worried that this kind of iron could not be rolled, and took a portion of the product to Shanghai for testing. As a result, it could not be rolled due to the high sulfur and slag content. After returning from Shanghai, he promptly reported this situation to the Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau, which was responsible for the construction of the factory. However, the person in charge of the Provincial Mining Bureau said: "This is just a technical problem, let the Pinding Iron Plant find a way to improve it!" In June of the same year, when the Provincial Mining Bureau convened a meeting of bureau and factory directors, Zhao Rong raised this issue again, but was criticized by the leading comrades. Jia Chongzhi, the director of the Department of Industry, said in his concluding remarks at the meeting: "Some cadres in the rolling mill are blindly spreading an atmosphere of failure. They neither know the temperature nor understand the chemical composition. They only did one test in Shanghai and said it was unsuccessful." "We must have full confidence and unswervingly build the rolling mill."
    In December 1953, the rolling mill was completed and put into production in January 1954. However, the iron they smelted could not be rolled, and all the installed machines had to be idled. The Provincial Department of Industry knew that production could not be carried out according to the original plan, and thought of getting some waste steel and substandard steel from the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to roll steel rods for doors and windows. They felt that this would also be very profitable. Therefore, they added a clause to the original principle of "facing the countryside, transforming local iron," which was to "process waste and substandard materials from state-owned factories." The Department of Industry, the Mining Bureau, and the rolling mill repeatedly negotiated with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, but the waste and substandard materials from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant were still to be returned to the furnace for refining, and they could only sell 28 tons of steel heads, which could not meet the needs of the rolling mill with a daily output of more than 40 tons of steel. The factory had no choice but to stop production.
    Without raw materials and production halted, this serious problem, which had never been anticipated, caused chaos in the Department of Industry and the Mining Bureau. They immediately sent people everywhere to find raw materials. In May, the Provincial Department of Industry heard that a factory in Changzhi had a batch of stagnant round steel that urgently needed to be processed, and quickly bought several hundred tons. The Provincial Department of Industry believed that this was the end of the problem and blindly issued tasks without any further consideration, requiring the rolling mill to complete the rolling of wire rod worth 500,000 yuan in the second quarter. In fact, the factory had just been built, the machines had not been properly test-run, and changing from rolling shaped iron to rolling wire rod required redesigning the die holes, and the equipment could not keep up for a while. Producing wire rod was also a new product for the rolling mill, and it was necessary to first organize a trial production of the new product. Excluding the time for the trial production of the new product, the actual production days in the second quarter were only 36 days left. At the same time, when the Provincial Department of Industry issued the task to the rolling mill, there were only thirteen workers in the rolling workshop, four of whom had studied rolling iron in Shanghai for three months, and the rest had only studied in Tianjin for two months.
    The rolling mill dared not accept this task, and put forward its opinions to the Mining Bureau. The Mining Bureau also reported to the Department of Industry, but the reply was: "The task must be completed. If there are not enough workers, they can be immediately increased. If two shifts cannot complete the task, then change to three shifts." According to this instruction, the rolling mill immediately recruited more than one hundred workers, increased the number of production shifts, and launched a competition campaign among the masses. However, the output value task of 500,000 yuan was still not completed. What was particularly serious was that when the capacity of the machine equipment had not been fully utilized, the factory increased the number of revolutions of the machine rope wheel from 160 revolutions to 200 revolutions. As a result, the machine rope was not strong enough, and a serious accident of burning the "Wujin tile" occurred, causing production to be interrupted for seven days. Because the workers were not familiar with the technical operations, various rolling equipment frequently had accidents, and almost no day was able to operate normally.
    In addition to frequent production interruptions and inability to continue, another major problem was that the products had no sales channels. Rolling 8cm wire rod requires high-quality low-carbon steel as raw material; however, the raw materials of this factory came from all directions, and the specifications and components were not uniform. Taking May as an example, among the 751 tons of raw materials purchased, 540 tons of medium-carbon steel were mixed in. Coupled with the low technical level of the workers and incomplete equipment, most of the rolled wire rod did not meet the quality standards. According to the plan of the Department of Industry, the products of the rolling mill were to be temporarily supplied to the Taiyuan Wire Rod Factory, but the Taiyuan Wire Rod Factory disliked the poor quality and was unwilling to accept them. The factory had to look for sales channels everywhere, but other factories and mines also disliked the poor quality and high prices of the rolling mill's products, and were unwilling to accept them.
    Although the rolling mill repeatedly requested solutions to these many problems, the Department of Industry and the Mining Bureau have never given a positive and definite answer. In fact, the Department of Industry and the Mining Bureau were also in a dilemma. Therefore, it was not until November of last year, when compiling the 1955 national plan, that the decision to stop production was made.
    A Yangquan Rolling Mill, newly built for less than a year, stopped production in this way. In addition to all the machine equipment and factory buildings being idle, the loss it caused to the country was that, due to the untimely supply of raw materials and frequent production stoppages, the state paid more than 70,000 yuan for the cost of maintaining shutdowns alone. More seriously, at a time when the country's construction urgently needed a large amount of steel, a large amount of steel was stockpiled here, exposed to the wind and rain. According to statistics in early May this year, more than 1,190 tons of various steel products (including more than 500 tons of finished products) were still stockpiled.
    Logically, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry should use the Yangquan Rolling Mill issue to carefully examine its own work and learn lessons. On the contrary, they used the principle of "facing the countryside, transforming local iron" as an excuse to shirk their responsibility. They even do not admit that the rolling mill has ended, and also say: the rolling mill has not ended, but is afraid of causing waste again, and is taking a steady step, waiting for the steel ingots from the Gu Xian Iron Plant to be supplied in a steady stream, and will also increase a roughing mill. They also optimistically said: on the major issue of transforming local iron, we have found a correct path. Here are two questions for the leading comrades of the Department of Industry to answer: if the rolling mill has really not ended, and the Gu Xian Iron Plant is to supply raw materials, then, Gu Xian is 315 kilometers away from Yangquan, of which 225 kilometers are transported by car and horse, and 90 kilometers by train. The freight alone will increase the cost by 80 to 100 yuan per ton. Moreover, in the rainy season, car transport will also have problems due to river blockages, affecting production. Another question is that the construction policy of the rolling mill is "facing the countryside, transforming local iron," while the Gu Xian Iron Plant is steelmaking in blast furnaces. If the Yangquan Rolling Mill is supplied with raw materials from the Gu Xian Iron Plant, then what is the relationship with the policy of transforming local iron?

　　建成一年就停止生产的阳泉辗铁厂
　　贾玉江
    一九五二年山西省阳泉市一带的土铁暂时滞销，山西省工业厅直接领导的平定铁厂的产品也找不到销路。省工业厅为了打开阳泉市一带的土铁销路，在平定铁厂和阳泉铁业试验厂试验的“石炭汽炒铁”（煤汽炼铁）成功后，就决定在阳泉市内建立一个小型辗轧工厂，以便把石炭汽炒出来的铁，经过辗轧，制成可以制造农具的“型”铁。但是，在确定建立辗铁厂前，并没有充分地调查生产对象和原料来源，更没有仔细研究阳泉、平定炼出来的铁是否可以辗轧。
    负责筹备建厂的副厂长赵溶，担心这种铁不能辗轧，曾带了一部分产品到上海去试验，结果因硫和渣太大，辗轧不成。他从上海回来后，就及时将这个情况反映给负责建厂的山西省矿产管理局，但省矿产管理局负责人却说：“这只是技术问题，叫平定铁厂想法改进吧！”同年六月，省矿产管理局召开局、厂长会议时，赵溶又将这一问题提出，却遭到了领导同志的批评。工业厅厅长贾冲之在会议总结时说：“辗铁厂有些干部，盲目散布失败空气。他们既不知道温度高低，也不懂得化学成份，只在上海试验了一次，就说不成功。”“我们要有充分信心，毫不动摇地把辗铁厂建立起来。”
    一九五三年十二月，辗铁厂建成了，并于一九五四年一月投入生产。但是，他们炼的铁不能辗轧，所有安装起来的机器只得闲起来。省工业厅知道不能按照原来的计划进行生产，又想到国营太原钢铁厂搞些废钢料和次钢料，轧制做门窗用的钢棍。他们觉得这样做也很赚钱。”因此就在原订的
  “面向农村，改造土铁”的方针下面，增加了一条“处理国营工厂的废、次料”。工业厅、矿产管理局和辗铁厂三番五次地同太原钢铁厂交涉，但太原钢铁厂的废、次料还要回炉再炼，只能卖给二十八吨钢头，满足不了这个日产四十余吨钢材的辗轧厂的需要，这个工厂只好停工。
    没有原料、生产停顿，这个从来没有预料到的严重问题，把工业厅和矿产管理局闹得手忙脚乱了，马上派人四出找寻原料。五月份，省工业厅听说长治有一个工厂有一批呆滞的元钢急要处理，就很快去买了几百吨来。省工业厅认为这就万事大吉了，不再作任何考虑，就盲目地下达任务，要辗铁厂在第二季度完成总值五十万元的辗轧盘条。事实上，当时工厂刚建起来，机器还没有很好地试运转，而且由辗轧型铁改为辗轧盘条，还得重新设计孔心，设备一时赶不上。生产盘条对辗铁厂说来也还是一种新产品，必须首先组织进行新产品试制，除去新产品试制的时间，第二季度的实际生产日数就只剩下三十六天了。同时，在省工业厅给辗铁厂下达任务时，厂里的辗轧车间只有十三个工人，其中有四个曾在上海学习过三个月辗铁，其余的只在天津学习过两个月。
    辗铁厂不敢接受这个任务，就向矿产管理局提出意见，矿产管理局也向工业厅反映，但得到的答复是：“任务必须完成，工人不够可立即增加，两班生产完不成任务，就改为三班。”按照这个指示，辗铁厂立即招雇了一百多工人，增加了生产班次，并在群众中开展了竞赛运动。但五十万元的产值任务还是完不成。特别严重的是，在机器设备能力还没有完全发挥出来的时候，厂里就将机绳轮的转数由一百六十转提高到二百转，结果机绳吃力不够，发生了烧坏“乌金瓦”的严重事故，使生产中断了七天。由于工人不熟悉技术操作，各种辗轧设备经常发生事故，几乎没有一天能够正常运转。
    除生产经常中断，不能持续进行以外，另一个大问题就是产品没有销路。辗轧八糎的盘条，必须要有质量好的低碳钢来做原料；但是，这个工厂的原料来自四面八方，规格、成分都不统一，以五月份为例，在购进的七百五十一吨原料中，就有五百四十吨中碳钢混在里面，加上工人技术水平低，设备不齐全，所辗轧的盘条大都不合乎质量标准。按照工业厅的计划，辗铁厂的产品要暂时供应太原线材厂，但太原线材厂嫌质量低劣，不愿要。厂里只得四出找寻销路，但其他厂矿也嫌辗铁厂的产品质量低劣，价格又高，不愿意要。
    这许许多多的问题，虽然辗铁厂再三呈请要求解决，但工业厅和矿产管理局一直没有作出肯定、确切的答复。事实上，工业厅和矿产管理局也实在有些骑虎难下。因此一直到去年十一月份，在编制一九五五年度国家计划时，才作出停止生产的决定。
    一个新建起来不到一年的阳泉辗铁厂，就这样停止了生产。它给国家造成的损失，除所有机器设备、厂房全部闲置外，因原料不能及时供应，生产经常停工，国家仅停工维持费一项就付出了七万多元。更严重的是，在国家建设正需要大量钢材的时候，这里却把大量的钢材积压起来，任风吹雨打。至今年五月初的统计，仍积压着各种钢材一千一百九十余吨（其中成品五百余吨）。
    按理山西省工业厅会通过阳泉辗铁厂问题，很好地检查自己的工作，记取教训。可是相反地，他们却拿了“面向农村，改造土铁”的方针作为借口，来推卸自己的责任。他们甚至不承认辗铁厂是结束了，还说：辗铁厂不是结束了，是害怕再形成浪费，而采取稳一步的方针，等到固县铁厂的钢锭可以源源供应的时候，还要增加一部初轧机。他们还乐观地说：在改造土铁这个重大问题上，我们算找到了一条正确的道路了。这里有两个问题要工业厅的领导同志解答：如果辗铁厂真的没有结束，要由固县铁厂供应原料的话，那末，固县距离阳泉三百一十五公里，其中汽车、马车运输二百二十五公里，火车运输九十公里，仅仅运费，每吨成本必将提高八十元至一百元，而且汽车运输，在雨季也会因河道阻隔发生问题，影响生产。另一个问题是，辗铁厂建厂的方针是“面向农村，改造土铁”，而固县铁厂却是高炉炼钢，如果阳泉辗铁厂由固县铁厂供应原料，那末同改造土铁的方针有何关系呢？
