Strictly Ban Reactionary, Absurd, and Obscene Publications

　　Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that in many cities, there are bookstores and book stalls that have been renting out many absurd, supernatural, and pornographic books and periodicals, spreading decadent and degenerate ideological poisons, and seriously poisoning the physical and mental health of young people and children. While vigorously eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology, it is necessary to effectively and strictly ban these publications.

　　Readers pointed out that absurd martial arts books and periodicals are themed on miraculous and bizarre things such as soaring through the clouds, spitting fire, and shooting swords. In essence, they are spreading idealism. Reader Zhang Xisheng said: Some book stalls rent out many picture books that are absurd and entice children to do bad things. These publications are completely opposed to our country's education policy. Many young people, after reading these kinds of publications, spend their days daydreaming, affecting production, and neglecting their studies. Some people are poisoned by these books and associate with hooligans or fantasize about entering the mountains to seek enlightenment. Reader Yi Fan reflected that Liu Dengyuan, a young worker at the Hanyang State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1, must read chivalrous swordsmen comic books before going to bed every day, sometimes until late at night, and then he would doze off at work the next day, often producing defective products. On Sundays, when others happily went on vacation, he went to the Dadao Temple and Guiyuan Temple to make friends with monks and Taoists, inquiring about whose "Taoist magic" was advanced, preparing to save money to make a few beautiful Taoist robes, so as to go to Mount Emei to find a master to seek enlightenment.

　　Obscene and pornographic publications are themed on praising and touting the decadent life of the bourgeoisie, eating, drinking, playing, sexual indulgence, incest, prostitution, gambling... These books, on the one hand, instill in young people a love of ease and aversion to work, the pursuit of material enjoyment, and the pursuit of lewd life, and on the other hand, spread pessimistic, world-weary, and decadent ideas. Reader Huang Yiping was originally a progressive young man under the age of twenty, but after reading obscene novels, his will became depressed, and he thought about raping women all day long, almost becoming a criminal.

　　Readers pointed out that there is also a category of reactionary "detective" and "scientific" novels themed on robbery, kidnapping, theft, bizarre and strange events, and bloody horror, which are spreading the ideas of murder and plunder of the reactionary ruling class and imperialism. The reactionary ruling class often uses this to recruit murderers, secret agents, and spies to sabotage the revolutionary cause, which cannot but arouse our great attention.

　　Many readers eagerly hope that all parents will love their children, educate them to engage in proper entertainment, and not let them go to those poisonous book stalls. According to preliminary statistics in Beijing, the number of people reading poisonous books and periodicals at old book stalls every day reaches 15,000, which shows that the phenomenon of reactionary publications spreading poison is serious. Reader Lu Ding wrote in a letter: I have carefully observed the children sitting in the shops renting out reactionary publications, and they are engrossed in what they are reading. Strange expressions appear on their faces from time to time, and unhealthy laughter is emitted. These phenomena are so incompatible with the education they receive in the classroom! How many such harmful "dens of demons" are there in the country, and how many children are being poisoned! These phenomena are simply unbearable to remain silent about.

　　Books and periodicals are the spiritual food of the people. For growing children and young people, books and periodicals have a particularly important meaning in enriching their knowledge, especially in forming their thoughts and qualities. We should guide children and young people to read, introduce some good books and periodicals to them, and never allow poisonous reactionary publications to poison them. The Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League Sichuan Provincial Committee has done a lot of work in introducing and guiding young people to read books and periodicals; You Yexun, the head teacher of Guiyang Experimental Primary School, has achieved good results in guiding children to read. These are all commendable examples.

　　Pornographic, obscene, absurd and supernatural books are tools used by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries to anesthetize the people and corrupt their ideology and morality. In order to protect the people's ideological health and to better cultivate the communist ideology and quality of the younger generation, the vast number of readers demand the exposure of the harm of those reactionary, obscene, and absurd publications and the ban on the distribution of such publications. This is absolutely necessary.

### 严厉取缔反动、荒诞、淫秽的书刊

　　严厉取缔反动、荒诞、淫秽的书刊
    最近，我们接到很多读者来信反映不少的城市里有一种书铺和书摊一直在出租许多荒诞神怪、色情淫秽的书刊，传播颓废腐朽的思想毒素，严重地毒害着青少年儿童的身心健康。在大力清除资产阶级思想影响的时候，必须有效地、严厉地取缔这些书刊。
    读者指出：荒诞的武侠书刊，是以腾云驾雾、喷火吐剑等神奇古怪的事情为主题的。实质上是散播唯心主义的东西。读者张熙升说：有的书摊上出租了不少小人书，都是内容荒谬、引诱孩子们做坏事的。这种书刊和我们国家的教育方针是完全对立的。不少的青年看了这类书刊，终日胡思乱想，影响生产，荒废功课。有的人受了这种书的毒害，同流氓为伍，或者幻想入山求道。读者一凡反映：汉阳国棉一厂青年工人刘登元，每天在睡觉之前，一定要看剑侠的连环画，有时一直看到深夜，第二天上班就打瞌睡，经常出废品。星期天，别人都高高兴兴地去度假期，他却到大道观、归元寺去同僧道们交朋友，打听谁的“道法”高明，准备积了钱以后做几件漂亮的道袍，好到峨嵋山上去寻师求道。
    淫秽的色情书刊，是以歌颂和标榜资产阶级的腐朽生活，吃、喝、玩、乐、性的放纵、乱伦、卖淫、赌博……为主题的。这些书，一方面灌输青年好逸恶劳，追求物质享受，追求淫荡生活，另一方面散布悲观厌世和堕落消沉的颓废思想。读者黄一萍原是一个不满二十岁的追求进步的青年，但当他看了淫秽的小说以后，意志变得消沉起来，成天想去强奸妇女，几乎成了罪犯。
    读者指出：还有一类以抢劫、绑票、偷盗、怪诞诡奇、血腥恐怖为主题的反动“侦探”、“科学”小说，是散播反动统治阶级和帝国主义屠杀和掠夺思想的。反动统治阶级常常借此来收罗杀人犯、特务和间谍，破坏革命事业，这也不能不引起我们极大的注意。
    许多读者热忱地盼望所有的家长，要爱护孩子，要教育孩子进行正当的娱乐，不要让孩子到那些有毒的书摊上去。据北京市初步统计，每天在旧书摊上阅读有毒素书刊的人数达到一万五千人，可见反动书刊散播毒素的现象是严重的。读者路丁来信说：我曾经注意地观察过那些坐在出租反动书刊铺子里的孩子们，他们看得很入神。在他们脸上时而出现奇怪的表情，时而发出不健康的笑声。这些现象和他们在课堂里受到的教育是多么不相称啊！全国有多少这样害人的“魔窟”，多少孩子在受着毒害！这些现象简直不能叫人再沉默了。
    书刊是人民的精神食粮，对于正在成长的儿童和青年来说，书刊在丰富他们的知识，尤其是形成他们的思想和品质方面有着特别重要的意义。我们应该指导儿童和青年们读书，介绍一些好的书刊给他们，绝不容许含有毒素的反动书刊毒害他们。青年团四川省委员会宣传部介绍和指导青年们阅读书刊做了不少的工作；贵阳市实验小学班主任游业勋指导孩子们读书取得了良好效果。这都是值得表扬的范例。
    色情淫秽和荒诞神怪的书，是帝国主义和国民党反动派麻醉人民、腐化人民思想道德的工具，为了保护人民思想健康，为了更好地培养青年一代的共产主义思想和品质，广大读者要求揭露那些反动、淫秽荒诞的书刊的毒害，取缔这种书刊的发行。这是完全必要的。
