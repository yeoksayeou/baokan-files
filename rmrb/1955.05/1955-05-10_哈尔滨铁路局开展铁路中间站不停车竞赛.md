Harbin Railway Bureau Launches No-Stop Competition for Intermediate Railway Stations
　　Zhang Jinchang
　　On October 12th of last year, Xu Kejun, a dispatcher at the Harbin Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration, boldly applied the method of non-stop train operation at intermediate stations, which had been successfully tested on double-track lines, to the single-track Binzhou Line between Zhalantun and Ang'angxi. This allowed a train to pass through fourteen intermediate stations over a 144.5-kilometer section and run directly to Ang'angxi Station. Xu Kejun's initiative in organizing non-stop train operation at intermediate stations immediately attracted the attention of many dispatchers and locomotive crew members. Soon, non-stop train operation at intermediate stations also appeared in the Mudanjiang Branch, Changchun Branch, and Shenyang Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration. Now, a widespread enthusiasm for no-stop competition at intermediate stations has been sparked among the vast number of dispatchers and locomotive crew members of the Harbin Railway Administration. In March of this year, the number of trains operating without stopping at intermediate stations on various lines of the Harbin Railway Administration reached 1,049, and in the first half of April, this increased to 1,602. Recently, the no-stop competition at intermediate stations has expanded further. Some dispatchers from the Qiqihar, Jilin, and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus have begun to learn from Xu Kejun's experience and have organized no-stop operation at intermediate stations. Railway administrations in the south are also studying this.
　　The majority of China's freight trains are section trains, but these trains do not run completely non-stop within a section. They often stop twice or more within a section. Apart from some stops being necessary for trains to give way on single-track lines, most stops are due to locomotives taking on water and cleaning the firebox. Locomotives consume a lot of water and coal while pulling trains and also need to have their running gear oiled. Therefore, several watering stations are set up on each section. While the locomotive is taking on water at the watering station, the crew members carry out cleaning and other technical operations, such as inspecting the locomotive and lubricating it. This type of locomotive technical operation usually takes about eight to twelve minutes. However, the speed of the locomotive decreases when it stops and starts. Therefore, including the additional time for starting and stopping, each stop takes fifteen minutes. If a train stops twice in a section to take on water, it will take half an hour. This greatly reduces the train's travel speed. Last year, the technical speed (the pure running speed of the train) for each train per hour across the country reached 36 kilometers, while the travel speed (the running time of the train plus the stopping time at intermediate stations) only reached 24.2 kilometers. The large difference between the technical speed and the travel speed is mainly due to the stops at intermediate stations. Currently, some sections on China's railways have very high train density. Trains stopping to take on water at intermediate stations often leads to congestion at the watering stations, which is even more pronounced on double-track lines. For example, in January of this year, the train density between Siping and Changchun on the Changchun-Dalian line was very high. On January 6th, one train taking on water at Changtu Station caused three trains behind it to wait. This not only extended the working hours of the crew members and disrupted the train operation order, but also caused vehicles loaded with materials to be held up at intermediate stations and unable to reach their destinations quickly.
　　However, technical operations such as taking on water and cleaning the firebox at intermediate stations are not always necessary. If well organized, the locomotive crew members can prepare the locomotive at the departure station, use water more economically during the journey, and avoid stopping for water or other technical operations on certain sections, which is entirely feasible. Advanced Soviet dispatchers and locomotive crew members have long organized non-stop train operation at intermediate stations. Advanced dispatchers such as P. Baylachyinaya and G.G. Sudnikov are both experts in opening "green streets" (green light signals for trains to pass through) for trains. Non-stop operation at intermediate stations already existed on the former China Changchun Railway in 1951. After China entered a period of planned construction, the railway transportation task increased daily. The transportation capacity of some sections was already feeling insufficient. In addition, dispatchers were constantly learning from the experience of Soviet dispatchers, and the organization of non-stop operation at intermediate stations began to brew among some advanced dispatchers. In the second quarter of 1954, dispatchers such as Xu Kejun from the Harbin Branch successfully tested non-stop operation at intermediate stations on the Harbin-Taolaizhao double-track line. In October 1954, Xu Kejun and locomotive crew members cooperated and successfully organized non-stop operation on the single-track Binzhou Line between Zhalantun and Ang'angxi.
　　Organizing non-stop train operation at intermediate stations has great economic value. First, it can increase the throughput capacity of certain sections. Thus, without increasing equipment, it can enable sections restricted by water supply capacity to transport more goods to meet the country's growing transportation needs. Second, non-stop operation at intermediate stations can increase travel speed, which directly accelerates the turnaround of locomotives and rolling stock, reduces transportation costs, and also speeds up the delivery of goods. Taking the Changchun Branch as an example, in February of this year, the branch organized a total of 668 trains to operate without stopping at intermediate stations, which resulted in the branch's locomotive turnaround time being shortened by 0.6 hours, and the number of kilometers traveled by locomotives per day increased by 23 kilometers. As a result, the branch saved 158 locomotive-days for the entire month, which alone is equivalent to saving the state 40,000 yuan in operating expenses. The rolling stock turnover rate was also shortened by 0.22 days, which is equivalent to saving 12,980 wagonloads for the entire month. Third, organizing no-stop at intermediate stations can help further development of the super-axle movement. The intermediate no-stop operation will greatly reduce the difficulties in starting and accidents like inability to go up and stopping to go back because of stopping outside the signals and stopping before the slope for the super-axle trains. At the same time, because the train does not stop at intermediate stations, the train can increase its speed, and the crew members can fully utilize the locomotive's inertia to generate greater traction force. Based on the current locomotive traction standards between Siping and Taolaizhao, if the train operates without stopping at intermediate stations, the locomotive's traction weight can be increased by nearly 10%. Fourth, non-stop operation at intermediate stations is faster, shortens section running time, and can also save a lot of coal. In addition to these, non-stop water intake and cleaning of the firebox at intermediate stations also alleviate the crew members' labor and eliminate the phenomenon of crew members working too long hours.
　　Organizing non-stop train operation at intermediate stations has grown up in constant struggle with conservative thinking. When advanced dispatchers and drivers first tested non-stop train operation at intermediate stations, they were strongly opposed by individual leaders of locomotive depots, who said: "It's hard enough to get the steam up when stopping to take on water! If we don't stop, the locomotive will have to be left on the road." "It's simply an adventure to not stop for over a hundred kilometers." But the drivers strongly supported non-stop train operation, saying: "As long as the dispatch is well planned and there are no temporary stops, we can do it." Thanks to the creative cooperation between dispatchers and drivers, this advanced experience was finally successfully promoted.
　　Currently, there are many favorable conditions for carrying out non-stop operation at intermediate stations on China's railways. For example, our dispatchers and locomotive crew members have accumulated some experience in commanding fast trains and driving techniques for traction of fast trains in the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movements in recent years. In particular, with the increasing progress of railway technical transformation in our country, the number of double-track lines is increasing, automatic block signals are gradually being installed, and the quality of the lines has improved, all of which are favorable conditions for carrying out non-stop operation at intermediate stations. However, those with conservative ideas do not see these aspects and use unfounded arguments such as "non-stop operation at intermediate stations is prone to accidents" and "increasing speed consumes more coal" to hinder it. Therefore, fighting against conservative thinking is still an important issue in carrying out non-stop operation at intermediate stations.
　　In carrying out the no-stop competition at intermediate stations, it is also necessary to effectively prevent the practice of simply creating typical examples. The purpose of organizing non-stop train operation at intermediate stations is to accelerate the turnaround of locomotives and rolling stock and improve transportation efficiency. If we simply use this to create prominent typical examples, so that one train operates without stopping at intermediate stations, while making other more trains sacrifice running time for it, this will reduce transportation efficiency. Therefore, it must be organized in a planned manner. When dispatchers make daily plans, they should determine the train numbers for non-stop operation at intermediate stations based on the train handover situation, so that after the trains operating without stopping at intermediate stations arrive at the junction station, there are immediately appropriate train numbers to connect with, so as to avoid the time saved by non-stop operation at intermediate stations being wasted at the junction station because the junction station does not have appropriate train numbers to connect with.
　　Organizing non-stop train operation at intermediate stations requires locomotive crew members to have skilled techniques for traction of fast trains, and the locomotive's lubricating system must also be appropriately improved to ensure that the locomotive does not stop for a long time on the section and that there are no accidents caused by lack of oil in driving or wear and tear on the machine. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of locomotives, improve the crew members' maintenance work on locomotives, and improve the technical level of locomotive crew members.
　　Organizing non-stop operation at intermediate stations is by no means just a matter for dispatchers and locomotive crew members. All railway traffic-related departments, such as stations, rolling stock, engineering, and telecommunications, play a large role in ensuring the realization of non-stop operation at intermediate stations. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen coordination and cooperation and establish a contact system.
　　Organizing non-stop train operation will further promote the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement currently being carried out across the country, and will undoubtedly play a large role in completing this year's transportation plan.

　　哈尔滨铁路局开展铁路中间站不停车竞赛
　　张金昌
    去年十月十二日，哈尔滨铁路管理局哈尔滨分局调度员徐克君，把在复线上试验成功的列车在中间站不停车运行的办法，大胆地运用在滨洲线扎兰屯到昂昂溪间的单线上，使一列车，在长达一百四十四点五公里的区段上，通过了十四个中间站，一直运行到昂昂溪车站。徐克君组织列车在中间站不停车的事迹，立即引起许多调度员和机车乘务员的重视。不久，在哈尔滨铁路管理局的牡丹江分局、长春分局、沈阳分局也出现了列车在中间站不停车运行的事。现在，哈尔滨铁路管理局广大调度员和机车乘务员普遍地掀起了中间站不停车竞赛的热潮。今年三月份，哈尔滨铁路管理局各线路开行中间站不停车的列车达一千零四十九次，四月上、中旬就增加到一千六百零二次。最近，中间站不停车竞赛又有了扩展，齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州等铁路局某些调度员已开始学习徐克君的经验，组织了中间站不停车的运行；在南方各铁路管理局也正在学习。
    我国货物列车绝大部分是区段列车，但这些列车在区段上运行，却不是完全直通运行的。往往在一个区段要停两次或两次以上。这种停车除一部分是单线因让列车必须停车外，大部分是由于机车上水、清炉而停车的。机车牵引着列车，要消耗很多水和烧很多煤，并要给机车走行部分浇油，所以在每个区段上都设有几个给水站。机车在给水站上水的同时，乘务员要进行清炉和其他技术作业。如检查机车、注油等。这种机车技术作业时间，一般要用八分钟到十二分钟左右。但机车在停车和起车时速度都要减低。因此，加上起停车的附加时间，停一次车就要消耗十五分钟。如果以一个区段停两次车上水的话，那就要消耗半个钟头的时间。这样列车旅行速度就大大降低。去年全路每列车每小时的技术速度（列车纯走行速度）达到三十六公里，而旅行速度（即列车走行时间加上中间站停车时间）只达到二十四点二公里。技术速度和旅行速度相差这样大，主要是列车在中间站停车所造成的。目前，我国铁路上的某些区段列车密度很大，列车在中间站停车上水，往往出现列车在给水站拥挤的现象，这种拥挤现象在复线表现得更为突出。如今年一月，长春大连线四平到长春间列车密度很大，一月六日，有一趟列车在昌图站上水，就使后面三个列车等线。这不仅延长了乘务员的劳动时间，打乱列车运行秩序，而且使满载物资的车辆积压在中间站不能迅速送到目的地。
    但是，列车在中间站停车上水、清炉等技术作业并不是全都必要的，如果能够很好地组织，使机车乘务员在始发站整备好机车，途中用水经济些，在某些区段上不停车上水，不进行其他技术作业，是完全可以办到的。苏联先进调度员和机车乘务员很早就组织了列车在中间站不停车的运行。先进调度员如普巴依拉琪娜亚和郭洛寥娃·苏德尼果夫，都是给列车开辟“绿街”（就是给列车可以通行的绿灯信号）的能手。一九五一年在我国铁路上，原中长路已有过中间站不停车运行。我国进入有计划建设后，铁路运输任务日益增加，某些区段的运输能力已经感到不足，加上调度员们不断学习苏联调度员的经验，组织中间站不停车运行开始在某些先进调度员中酝酿。一九五四年第二季度，哈尔滨分局调度员徐克君等人，曾在哈尔滨到陶赖昭复线上试验中间站不停车成功。一九五四年十月，徐克君和机车乘务员合作，又在滨洲线扎兰屯到昂昂溪间的单线上组织成功。
    组织列车在中间站不停车运行，是有很大经济价值的。首先，它可以提高某些区段的通过能力。这样，在不增加设备的条件下，可以使某些受给水能力限制的区段，运送更多的货物来满足国家对铁路日益增长的运输要求。其次，列车在中间站不停车，可以提高旅行速度，这就直接加速机车车辆的周转，降低运输成本，同时也加速货物的运送时间。以长春分局为例，在今年二月份，该分局共组织六百六十八个列车在中间站不停车，致使该分局机车全周转时间缩短零点六小时，机车每天走行的公里提高了二十三公里，因而全月节省一百五十八个机车台日，只这一次就等于给国家节省四万元的运营开支。车辆周转率也随着缩短了零点二二天，全月等于节省一万二千九百八十辆车皮。第三、组织中间站不停车可以有助于超轴运动的进一步发展。列车在中间站不停车的运行，会大大减少超轴列车由于信号机外停车、坡道前停车等引起的起车困难和拉不上去停退等事故。同时，由于列车在中间站不停车，列车可以提高速度，乘务员就能充分利用机车惰力，使机车产生更大的牵引力量。以四平、陶赖昭间现在的机车牵引定数计算，如列车在中间站不停车运行，可以使机车的牵引重量提高近百分之十左右。第四、中间站不停车运行，速度快，缩短区段运行时间，还能节省大量煤炭。除这些以外，中间站不停车上水、清炉，也减轻乘务员的操劳和消灭乘务员劳动时间过长的现象。
    组织列车在中间站不停车运行，是在同保守思想不断斗争中成长起来的。在先进调度员和司机刚试验列车在中间站不停车运行的时候，曾经遭到个别机务段负责干部强烈的反对，他们说：“停车上水还烧不上来汽呢！要是不停车，机车就得放在半道上。”“一百多公里不停车简直是冒险。”可是司机们却非常拥护中间站不停车运行，他们说：“只要调度计划得好，不发生临时停车，我们就能干。”由于调度员与司机们的创造性合作，终于使这一先进经验推行成功了。
    目前，在我国铁路上开展中间站不停车运行，是有很多有利条件的。如我们的调度员和机车乘务员在几年来满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，已经积累一些指挥快速列车的经验和牵引快速列车的驾驶技术，特别是随着我国铁路技术改造的日益进展，复线增多，自动闭塞信号逐渐增设，线路质量已有提高等等，都是开展中间站不停车的有利条件。但有保守思想的人看不到这些方面，而以毫无科学根据的“中间站不停车好出事故”“提高速度费煤”等论调来加以阻碍。因此，与保守思想作斗争，仍是开展中间站不停车的一个重要问题。
    开展中间站不停车竞赛，还必须切实防止单纯创造典型的做法。组织列车在中间站不停车的目的，是为了加速机车车辆周转，提高运输效率，如果单纯以这个来创造突出典型，使一趟列车在中间站不停车运行，而使其他更多的列车为它牺牲运行时间，是会降低运输效率的。因此，必须有计划的组织。在调度员作日间计划时，就应当根据列车交接情况，确定中间站不停车的车次，使中间站不停车的列车，到达分界站后，立即有适当车次衔接，以免列车在中间站不停车，提前到达分界站，而分界站没有适当车次衔接，把中间站不停车的时间，又浪费在分界站上。
    组织列车在中间站不停车运行，要求机车乘务员有熟练的牵引快速列车的技术，机车给油装置也必须作适当的改进，以保证机车在区段上长时间不停车，不发生驾驶上和机器因缺油造成磨耗等事故。因此，必须提高机车质量，改进乘务员对机车的保养工作，提高机车乘务员的技术水平。
    组织中间站不停车，绝不只是调度员和机车乘务员的事，铁路一切行车有关部门如车站、车辆、工务、电务等部门对保证实现中间站不停车都起着很大作用，因此，必须加强配合和协作，建立联系制度。
    组织中间站不停车运行，会进一步推动目前在全路开展着的满载、超轴、五百公里运动，无疑地，对完成今年的运输计划会起很大作用。
