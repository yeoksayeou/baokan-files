Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 8th. The people of all circles in Lüda City, who participated in the farewell rally for the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area returning home, today spent an unforgettable day of joyful celebration with their friends of ten years, the Soviet Army, in Stalin Square.

　　As the farewell rally concluded, a warm friendship celebration unfolded in Stalin Square. The Soviet Army representatives were surrounded by the cheering crowd in the center of the square. Many Soviet Army representatives were lifted and thrown into the air. The Soviet Army representatives also lifted soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, students, government workers, and Young Pioneers. In the center of the square, people formed several large circles. Soviet Army officers and soldiers danced together with the well-wishers. Hundreds of Young Pioneers put their red scarves on the "Soviet Uncles," expressing their deepest love and respect for the Soviet Army. Dozens of model workers and advanced workers from the Dalian Shipyard gave their prizes to the Soviet Army as farewell gifts. Yang Baoshan, a female soldier of the People's Liberation Army, pinned a commemorative badge with Chairman Mao's image on the chest of a Soviet soldier. This Soviet soldier gave Yang Baoshan a photo of him and his brother taken in their childhood. Many people and Soviet Army representatives wrote farewell messages to each other in booklets.

　　In the boiling crowd, a rural woman named Liu Suqiu searched everywhere for Soviet soldier Peterov with her seven-year-old son, searching for a full half hour without success. Finally, she grabbed the hand of a young Soviet Army officer and gave him a photo of her son taken a few days ago. She pointed to the photo and said, "In the autumn two years ago, this child fell into the river and almost drowned. Comrade Peterov saved him, and my whole family will never forget Peterov's kindness!"

　　As the celebration came to an end, endless streams of people joyfully held hands with the Soviet Army and walked shoulder to shoulder, dancing, enthusiastically cheering and singing. When the Soviet Army representatives left the venue, people were still reluctant to part with them. In the streets, hundreds of people gathered, stopping passing Soviet Army officers and soldiers to sing and dance together.

　　旅大市人民同苏军代表尽情联欢
    据新华社旅大八日电　参加欢送驻旅顺口地区苏军回国大会的旅大市各界人民，今天在斯大林广场上同他们十年相处的友人——苏军尽情欢乐地度过了永远难以忘怀的一天。
    当欢送大会结束时，斯大林广场上展开了热烈的友谊联欢活动。苏军代表被欢送的人群围在广场中心。许多苏军代表被人们举起，并抛向空中。苏军代表也把中国人民解放军战士、学生、机关工作人员和少年先锋队队员们高举起来。在广场的中心，人们围了几个大圈子。苏军军官、士兵们和欢送的人一起舞蹈。成百名少年先锋队队员给“苏军叔叔”戴上自己的红领巾，表示他们对苏军最深厚的敬爱。大连造船公司的几十名车间劳动模范和先进工作者，把他们得到的奖品送给苏军，作为临别赠礼。解放军女战士杨宝善把镶有毛主席像的纪念章戴在一个苏军战士的胸前。这个苏军战士就把他在童年时和他的哥哥合摄的照片送给杨宝善。许多人和苏军代表在小册子上互相写下了临别赠言。
    在沸腾的人群中，一位农村妇女刘素秋带着自己七岁的儿子到处找苏军战士彼德洛夫，整整找了半个小时，也没找到。最后他抓住一位年轻的苏军军官的手，把她儿子在几天前照的相片送给他。她指着这张相片说：“两年前的秋天，这个孩子掉到河里，几乎淹死，彼德洛夫同志把他救活了，我全家永远也忘不了彼德洛夫的恩情！”
    当联欢活动结束时，无尽的人流欢乐地和苏军手挽着手，肩靠着肩，边走边舞，热情地欢呼和歌唱。当苏军代表离开会场时，人们还舍不得和他们分开。在马路上，聚集着成百的人群，把路过的苏军军官和战士们留下来一起唱歌和跳舞。
