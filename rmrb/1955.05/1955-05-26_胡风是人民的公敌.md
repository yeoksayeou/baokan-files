　　Hu Feng is a Public Enemy of the People
　　Jin Jin
    Hu Feng pretended to be a revolutionary, but secretly engaged in anti-Party and anti-people activities that could not be brought to light. The two batches of materials exposed in the "People's Daily" on the 13th and 24th of this month have completely exposed the hideous face of this counter-revolutionary element.
    Now the facts are very clear: Hu Feng is the head of a counter-revolutionary group. This counter-revolutionary group has a strict organization and discipline (in Hu Feng's letter to Man Tao, he talked about "obeying organizational principles"). Hu Feng's letters to his pawns were orders, instructing them on how to eavesdrop on important news and how to steal Party documents. He drilled everywhere, employing insidious means. What difference is there between these counter-revolutionary activities carried out by him and his pawns and those carried out by American and Chiang Kai-shek spies? The Chinese Communist Party has gained power, and the Chinese people have been liberated, but Hu Feng and his group of pawns have gone underground to engage in conspiratorial activities. Is this "the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie"? This is the Party and the people's most vicious and cunning enemy, the public enemy of the people!
    I am engaged in literary work, and I am very angry that there is such a sinister and vicious counter-revolutionary organization in the literary world, and that the counter-revolutionary ringleader Hu Feng, who hung up the "writer" signboard, dared to carry out conspiratorial activities so boldly. He despised the power of the Party and the people, and wanted to subject the Chinese people to the "trauma of enslavement" again, but he miscalculated. He did not expect that China is now a liberated China, and any anti-people conspiracy cannot escape the punishment of the people.
    Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary organization has now been discovered, but we must learn from this incident, raise our vigilance, and not allow enemies in any disguise to take advantage of loopholes.

　　胡风是人民的公敌
　　金近
    胡风假装革命，暗地里却做着见不得人面的反党反人民的勾当。本月十三日和二十四日“人民日报”上所揭发的两批材料，把这个面目狰狞的反革命分子的面貌完全暴露出来了。
    现在事实已经很清楚了，胡风是领导一个反革命集团的头子。这个反革命集团有严密的组织和纪律（胡风给满涛的信里，就谈到“要遵守组织原则”），胡风给他的爪牙写信，就是发号施令，指使爪牙怎么偷听重要消息，怎么盗窃党内文件。他到处钻空子，施展阴谋手段。他和他的爪牙所做的这些反革命勾当，和美蒋特务所做的又有什么差别呢？中国共产党获得政权了，中国人民得到解放了，而胡风和他的一批爪牙却钻入地下，进行阴谋活动，这难道是“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”吗？这是党和人民的最恶毒、最狡猾的敌人，是人民的公敌！
    我是从事文学工作的，我很气愤，在文学界里面竟有这样阴险毒辣的反革命组织，那个挂了“作家”招牌的反革命头子胡风，竟敢这样胆大妄为地进行阴谋活动。他藐视了党和人民的力量，想叫中国人民重新受到“奴役的创伤”，可是他估计错了，他没有想到，中国现在是解放了的中国，任何反人民的阴谋活动也逃不脱人民的惩办。
    胡风的反革命组织现在已经发现了，但我们必须从这件事里吸取教训，提高警惕，不让披着任何伪装的敌人钻空子。
