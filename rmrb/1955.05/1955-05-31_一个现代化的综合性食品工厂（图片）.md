　　A Modern Comprehensive Food Factory

　　The state-owned Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 1 is a comprehensive food factory. The entire factory has three production workshops, manufacturing more than 100 kinds of food, including fruit and meat canned goods, sweets, cold drinks, and milk substitutes.

　　The workers in the factory's milk substitute workshop adopted the "uniform slurry pouring" and "complex extraction" operation methods, which greatly improved the output of milk substitute. In the production tasks from January to April this year, each barrel of soybeans produced an average of 7.43 kilograms more milk substitute than in the fourth quarter of last year. The workers in the cold drink workshop also launched an inter-factory competition with the workers in the Yimin Food Factory No. 3 cold drink workshop, striving to ensure that 100% of their products meet the standards.

　　The various foods produced by the state-owned Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 1 are not only supplied to the needs of Shanghai citizens, but are also transported to countries such as the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia, in exchange for various building steel and machinery, supporting the country's socialist economic construction. These canned foods are also praised and welcomed abroad. This factory also frequently manufactures various dry rations and canned goods to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

　　Currently, all the factory's workers are working hard to further improve output and quality. The total value of production this year is planned to increase by more than seven times compared to 1950.　Photo by our reporter Wang Zhiyuan

　　一个现代化的综合性食品工厂
    国营上海益民食品一厂是一个综合性的食品工厂。全厂有三个生产车间，制造水果、肉类罐头、糖果，冷饮和代乳粉等一百多种食品。
    这个厂的代乳粉车间职工采用了“均匀放浆”和“复式抽提”的操作法，使代乳粉的产量有了很大的提高。在今年一月到四月的生产任务中，每桶大豆平均要比去年第四季度多出代乳粉七点四三公斤。冷饮车间的职工也同益民三厂冷饮车间职工展开厂际竞赛，要为保证产品百分之一百合乎规格而努力。
    国营上海益民食品一厂生产的各种食品除了供应上海市民的需要外，还运销到苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克等国家，换回各种建筑钢材和机器，支援了国家的社会主义经济建设。这些罐头食品在国外也受到赞美和欢迎。这个厂还经常制造各种干粮和罐头支援中国人民解放军解放台湾。
    现在，全厂职工正在为进一步提高产量和质量而努力，今年的生产总值计划要比一九五○年增加七倍多。　本报　王志渊摄
