Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: TASS reported that delegations composed of prominent physicists and engineers from the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic arrived in Moscow successively at the end of March and in mid-April this year to hold talks on the issue of Soviet assistance to these countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Soviet side participating in the talks included prominent Soviet physicists and engineers.

As a result of the talks, agreements were signed separately. The agreements stipulate that during 1955-1956, the Soviet Union will complete the design work for experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators for the aforementioned countries, and will supply these countries with experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators produced by Soviet industry; will provide these countries with the necessary scientific and technical data on these atomic piles and particle accelerators free of charge; will provide technical assistance in the installation and use of these atomic piles through guidance by Soviet experts, and will supply the necessary quantities of fissionable materials and other materials required for atomic piles and research work; and will supply the aforementioned countries with the necessary quantities of radioactive isotopes until the experimental atomic piles supplied by the Soviet Union begin to be used.

The Soviet Union will train personnel sent by these countries to become scientific workers and engineers in nuclear physics, radiochemistry, the application of isotopes in science and technology, and atomic pile technology. The training of these experts will be carried out by specialized facilities, scientific research institutions, and Soviet institutions of higher education.

The implementation of the assistance measures stipulated in the agreements will enable each contracting country to establish modern scientific experimental centers in a short period of time and to carry out research work in nuclear physics and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

During their stay in the Soviet Union, the members of the delegations from various countries visited scientific research institutions in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and Kharkov to observe scientific research work in the peaceful use of atomic energy, including several working experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators.

The delegations also visited an atomic energy power station and observed its operation.

The Soviet government has also decided to expand the scope of countries to which it provides assistance and help in developing scientific experimental work in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and has put forward such proposals to the Hungarian People's Republic and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and will hold talks with representatives of these countries in the near future to conclude corresponding agreements.

　　就苏联帮助和平使用原子能问题
　　苏联同中波捷罗德等国签订协定
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：由中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和德意志民主共和国著名物理学家和工程师组成的代表团，于今年三月底和四月中先后来到莫斯科，就苏联帮助这些国家和平使用原子能的问题举行会谈。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有苏联著名物理学家和工程师。
    会谈结果，分别签订了协定。协定规定，在一九五五—一九五六年内，苏联为上述国家完成实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器的设计工作，并将苏联工业生产的实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器供应给这些国家；无偿地交给这些国家关于这些原子堆和粒子加速器的必要科学技术资料；通过由苏联专家指导的办法，在这些原子堆的安装和使用方面给予技术帮助，供应原子堆和研究工作所需的必要数量的可分裂物质和其他物质；供应上述国家以必要数量的放射性同位素，直到苏联所供应给它们的实验性原子堆开始使用时止。
    苏联将把这些国家派来的人员培养成为核子物理学方面、放射化学方面、把同位素用于科学技术方面以及原子堆技术方面的科学工作人员和工程师。这些专家的培养工作将由专门的场所、科学研究机关和苏联高等学校进行。
    实现协定中所规定的帮助措施，将使每一个协定缔结国能在短期内建立现代化的科学实验中心，并在核子物理学和研究和平使用原子能方面展开研究工作。
    在苏联逗留期间，各国代表团人员参观了莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅和哈尔科夫等地科学研究机关在和平使用原子能方面进行的科学研究工作，其中包括几个工作中的实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器。
    各代表团还参观了原子能发电站和它的工作。
    苏联政府还决定在发展和平使用原子能的科学实验工作方面扩大它给予协助和帮助的国家的范围，并且已向匈牙利人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国提出了这种建议，并将于最近期内同这些国家的代表举行会谈以缔结相应的协定。
