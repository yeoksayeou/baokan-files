　　Sichuan Chongning Achieves a Bumper Harvest of Minor Spring Crops
　　Farmers in Chongning County, Sichuan Province, achieved a bumper harvest of minor spring crops planted in the winter on vacant field ridges last year. According to incomplete statistics from various areas, the increase in production from qingke barley, peas, and broad beans alone will be nearly one million jin, with a total output value of 52,200 yuan, averaging an increase in income of more than 2.4 yuan per household in the county. Farmers in Yuanjue Township harvested more than 117,000 jin of qingke barley and peas planted on vacant field ridges, which is equivalent to the township's summer grain requisition and purchase quota for this year.
　　Chongning County belongs to the western Sichuan plain region, and its land and climate are suitable for planting minor spring crops. In order to increase grain production and support national industrial construction, farmers across the county eliminated 60,000 mu of vacant winter field ridges in the winter of 1954, planting various minor spring crops on more than 130,000 mu of field ridges. The widespread bumper harvest of various minor spring crops this year has greatly encouraged farmers' confidence in tapping potential to increase grain production. Many farmers are now intercropping corn on field ridges where beans are planted, and many agricultural production cooperatives have also drafted plans for field ridge planting next year.

　  四川崇宁小春作物丰收
    四川省崇宁县农民去年利用冬季空田坎种植的小春作物获得丰收。据各地不完全统计，仅青稞、豌豆、葫豆三种小春作物，就可增产近一百万斤，总产值五万二千二百多元，平均全县每户农民可增加收入二元四角多。元觉乡农民利用空田坎种的青稞和豌豆，今年就收了十一万七千多斤，相当于全乡今年夏征统购数字。
    崇宁县属于川西平原地区，土地气候都适宜种植小春作物。为了多增产粮食，支援国家工业建设，
  一九五四年冬天，全县农民消灭了六万亩冬季空田坎，共在十三万多亩田坎栽种了各种小春作物。今年各种小春作物的普遍丰收，更大大鼓舞了农民挖潜力增产粮食的信心。现在已有许多农民在种豆子的田坎上间种玉米，还有许多农业生产合作社还拟订了下年田坎种植计划。　　　　（蔡成选）
