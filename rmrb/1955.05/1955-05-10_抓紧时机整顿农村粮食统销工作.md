　　Seize the Opportunity to Rectify Rural Grain Unified Sales Work

The implementation of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain nationwide has achieved great success. The vast number of farmers have worked hard to increase fertilizer accumulation and production investment, effectively promoting spring plowing production. However, with the exception of a few provinces and regions, many areas have not combined grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" with a timely and serious rectification of grain unified sales work from March to June this year. The national grain sales volume has greatly increased during these months. In many provinces and regions, the population supplied with grain in rural areas, calculated at an average of one jin of grain per person per day, reaches 70 to 80 percent of the total agricultural population, and in some cases even exceeds 96 percent. This is obviously extremely unreasonable. Although the state supplies so much grain, some truly grain-deficient farmers cannot buy grain in time, while some farmers who are not grain-deficient continue to demand supplies; moreover, the places with the largest grain sales volume are often the places with the most supply problems.

There are many reasons for the significant increase in grain sales volume. Examining the subjective reasons, the primary cause is that many cadres, including some leading cadres, have pitted grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" against the rectification of grain unified sales work. They believe that grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" is an effective way to alleviate certain tensions in rural areas; but rectifying grain unified sales work means controlling sales volume, which will make the rural grain sales situation even more tense, diluting the effect of grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales." Therefore, they believe that to rectify grain unified sales work, they can only increase grain sales volume. Due to this erroneous idea, they do not concentrate their efforts on reducing unreasonable sales volume, but instead reach out to higher levels to request more grain allocations. In fact, rectifying rural grain unified sales work is only to compress the unreasonable and undeserved portion of the supply, to ensure the necessary supply in rural areas, and to ensure that the state's grain sales targets are not breached. Fulfilling this requirement is not only necessary but also possible. Because currently, although there are also instances of insufficient supply where it should be supplied in rural grain supply, the main and widespread phenomenon is that too much is supplied where it should be supplied less, and supply is given where it should not be given. After Jiangsu Haimen County inspected eighty-one townships where grain supply appeared tight, it was found that only 29.6 percent of the townships' tightness was due to insufficient supply, while the remaining 70 percent was caused by chaotic supply, instigation by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and other problems in the work.

Some grassroots cadres say, "Any work is easy to do, but grain work is difficult." They believe that grain sales volume cannot be controlled, so they should try to satisfy the farmers' demands, and the more sales volume the better. In this way, they abandon their responsibility on the grain issue. In Weichang County, Rehe Province, grain purchase certificates in the 12th district were filled out arbitrarily by village cadres, to the point where the grain purchase figures exceeded the original sales target of 400,000 jin by a multiple; although 230,000 jin were later recovered, it still exceeded the target by 170,000 jin. Some grassroots cadres also want to supply according to the indicators stipulated by higher authorities, but they are afraid of "offending people," so they adopt the method of average supply. As a result, the supply surface is very large, the supply quantity is relatively reduced, and the grain-deficient farmers are not sufficiently supplied, while the non-grain-deficient farmers buy grain instead. In fact, the practical experience in many areas has long proven that as long as the policy of reasonable supply is seriously implemented, grain work is not difficult to do. After Taipingtou Village, Daci Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu, rectified grain unified sales work, four truly grain-deficient farmers in the village received supplementary supply certificates, fourteen non-grain-deficient farmers returned their supply certificates, and sixteen farmers who received early supply said they could postpone the supply; the village's total supply volume was reduced from 16,000 jin to 6,000 jin, and all the farmers in the village were very satisfied.

It must be pointed out that the purpose of reducing grain sales is not only to ensure that the state's sales targets are not breached, but also to earnestly ensure the necessary supply for grain-deficient households under the principle of saving grain. It is also wrong to ignore this point, as it will equally tighten the rural grain situation and affect farmers' production and life. Experience has shown that other farmers will not have opinions if grain-deficient farmers can buy a suitable amount of grain. If the supply of grain-deficient farmers cannot be guaranteed, grain-deficient farmers will inevitably raise opinions, which may create opportunities for some non-grain-deficient farmers to fraudulently claim more purchases. Therefore, to rectify the grain unified sales work well, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between the truly grain-deficient households and the farmers who are not grain-deficient but are simply claiming to be, and it is necessary to do arduous and in-depth work, and absolutely cannot take a simple and coercive approach. A township in Wanrong County, Shanxi, originally reported a shortage of more than 110,000 jin of grain. Because the cadres adopted a coercive method to forcibly compress sales volume, the truly grain-deficient households and the falsely grain-deficient households jointly "butted heads" with the cadres, and finally increased the sales volume to 140,000 jin; although the sales volume increased, the farmers were still not satisfied. Many other examples also show that due to the cadres' erroneous practices of adopting average supply reductions and announcing that all grain purchase certificates issued have been invalidated, the sales volume often expanded instead, and the truly grain-deficient farmers cannot get the necessary supply. This is also an important lesson in the current rural grain supply work.

In order to complete the urgent task of rectifying grain unified sales work, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the entire Party, first to enlighten the thinking of Party members, League members, cadres, and activists, and through them, rely on the broad masses to carry out full, arduous political work and mass work. The state's sales targets should be announced publicly to the masses (focusing on the targets for April to June and July to September this year, and in some areas, the targets for the 1954-55 year), publicizing the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales and the important role of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" to the masses, explaining the consistency between "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" and the rectification of grain unified sales work, explaining the state's grain sales situation, analyzing the unreasonable phenomena in the grain supply of the region and township; then through the township people's congress and various mass meetings, through the exemplary actions of Party members, League members, cadres, and activists, the masses should be led to conduct discussions and evaluations, adjust and correct the unreasonable phenomena in the supply work. Summarizing the preliminary experience of some regions in rectifying grain unified sales work, various localities can adopt the following practices according to the actual situation: First, because time is pressing, under the unified leadership and specific guidance of the provincial Party committee, the county should be the focus of command for rectifying grain unified sales work, concentrating all forces to hold three-level cadre meetings in a very short time; at the meeting, in addition to explaining the aforementioned content and requirements to the cadres, so that the cadres grasp the spirit of rectifying grain unified sales work, it is necessary to provide specific information on the region and township, and rationally determine or adjust the grain sales targets of each district and township according to the state's sales targets. Second, after the work reaches the villages, the method of demonstration and mobilization at all levels, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, and from advanced to backward, should be adopted, first to enlighten the thinking of Party members, and then to enlighten the thinking of township people's representatives, township people's committee members, village-level cadres and above, and activists. Then convene the township people's congress and township people's committee, using the language of the masses and local examples to explain the importance of rectifying grain unified sales work, and discuss and adopt the township's plan to improve grain unified sales work. After this work is done, each township can have dozens or even hundreds of people who understand the policy and have been enlightened. Through these people, the situation can be thoroughly clarified through mass brewing, discussion, consultation, and evaluation, the boundary between the truly grain-deficient and the non-grain-deficient can be clarified, unreasonable supply volume can be reduced, and the supply to grain-deficient households can be guaranteed.

Rectifying grain unified sales work is to earnestly ensure the supply of grain-deficient farmers, so that those non-grain-deficient farmers who demand supply will no longer blindly clamor, and to verify and deduct those parts that should not be supplied. As for those who have bought more grain in the previous period, it should be allowed if they voluntarily return part of the grain that they bought more and have not consumed. However, in the rectification of grain unified sales work, it is necessary to oppose forcing surplus grain households to sell surplus grain again, so as to avoid forming an infringement on the interests of middle peasants. For farmers who still have surplus grain, in addition to the mutual exchange between them and grain-deficient households, they can only be allowed to voluntarily take it to the national grain market for free sale to adjust the rural supply and demand, and no interference should be made. In the rectification of grain unified sales work, it is necessary to correctly implement the class line, unite and educate the middle peasants well; and necessary blows and struggles must be given to individual landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who provoke sabotage and take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble.

Now is the season when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available. We must seize the opportunity to quickly and effectively solve the problems existing in the rural grain supply, resolutely control the grain sales volume at a reasonable level, and prepare a good start for the next year's grain sales work.

### 抓紧时机整顿农村粮食统销工作

　　抓紧时机整顿农村粮食统销工作
　　在全国范围内实行的粮食“定产、定购、定销”，已经有了很大的成就。广大农民努力增积肥料，增加生产投资，有效地推动了春耕生产。但是，除少数省区以外，许多地区并没有结合粮食“定产、定购、定销”，及时地认真地把今年三月至六月的粮食统销工作加以整顿。全国粮食销售数量在这几个月内是大大增加了。许多省区的农村中，如以每人每天平均供应一斤粮食计算，供应的人口达农业总人口的百分之七十到八十，有的甚至达到百分之九十六以上。这显然是极不合理的。国家供应的粮食虽然这么多，但是，某些真正缺粮的农民还不能及时买到粮食，某些并不缺粮的农民却继续要求供应；而且正是粮食销量过大的地方，往往就是供应问题最多的地方。
    粮食销售量大大增加的原因是很多的。就主观的原因来检查，首先是由于许多干部，包括某些领导干部，把粮食“定产、定购、定销”跟整顿粮食统销工作对立起来了。他们认为，粮食“定产、定购、定销”是缓和农村某些紧张现象的有效办法；但整顿粮食统销工作是要控制销售量，这就会引起农村粮食销售情况更加紧张，冲淡粮食“定产、定购、定销”的作用。因此，他们认为要整顿粮食统销工作，就只能增加粮食销售量。由于存在这种错误的想法，他们就不是集中精力缩减不合理的销售量，而是伸手向上级要求增拨粮食。其实，整顿农村粮食统销工作只是为了把不合理的不该供应的部分加以压缩，以保证农村必不可少的供应，并确保国家的粮食销售指标不被突破。实现这个要求不但是必要的，而且是可能的。因为目前在农村粮食供应中，虽然也存在该供应而供应不足的现象，但主要的、普遍的现象却是该少供应的供应多了，不该供应的也供应了。江苏海门县对粮食供应表现紧张的八十一个乡进行了检查，查明其中只有百分之二十九点六的乡的紧张现象是由于供应数量不足所引起的，其余百分之七十的乡的紧张现象，都是因为供应过乱，地主、富农、反革命分子挑拨煽动和其他工作上的毛病造成的。
    有些基层干部说，“什么工作都好作，就是粮食工作难”。他们认为，粮食销售量是无法控制的，所以应该尽量满足农民的要求，销售量“越多越好”。这样，他们就在粮食问题上放弃了自己的责任。热河省围场县十二区的购粮证由村干部随意填发，以至填发的购粮数字超出原定四十万斤的销售指标的一倍；后来虽然收回了二十三万斤，但仍超过十七万斤。有些基层干部也想根据上级规定的指标进行供应，但是害怕“得罪人”，就采取了平均供应的方法，结果，供应的面很大，供应的数量相对缩小，缺粮的农民供应不足，不缺粮的农民反而买了粮食。其实，许多地区的实际经验早证明了：只要认真贯彻合理供应的方针，粮食工作并不是难做的。江苏昆山县大慈乡太平头村整顿粮食统销工作以后，全村四户真正缺粮的农民补领了供应证，十四户不缺粮的农民交回了供应证，十六户提早得到供应的农民都表示可以推迟供应；全村供应量由一万六千斤减至六千斤，全村农民都很满意。
    必须指出，缩减粮食销量的目的不仅是为了保证国家的销售指标不被突破，而且是为了在节约粮食的原则下，切实保证缺粮户的必不可少的供应。忽视了这一点也是错误的，它同样会使农村粮食情况紧张起来，同样会影响农民的生产和生活。经验证明，让缺粮农民买到适量的粮食，其他农民是不会有意见的。如果不能保证缺粮农民的供应，缺粮农民必然提出意见，这就可能给某些不缺粮的农民造成冒领多购的机会。因此，要把粮食统销工作整顿好，就必须把农村真正的缺粮户和并不缺粮只是喊叫缺粮的农户分别清楚，就必须做艰苦深入的工作，绝不能采取简单从事和强迫命令的作法。山西万荣县一个乡原报缺粮十一万多斤，由于干部采取了强迫命令的办法强行压缩销量，以至真缺粮户和假缺粮户共同向干部“顶牛”，最后竟把销售量增到十四万斤；销量虽然增加了，农民还是不满意。其它许多例子也说明了，由于干部采取了平均削减供应量和宣布已经发出的购粮证一律作废等错误作法，结果销量往往反而扩大了，真正缺粮的农民并不能得到必要的供应。这也是当前农村粮食供应工作中的一个重要教训。
    为了完成整顿粮食统销工作的紧急任务，必须动员全党的力量，首先打通党员、团员、干部和积极分子的思想，通过他们依靠广大群众，进行充分的艰苦的政治工作和群众工作。应该公开向群众宣布国家的销售指标（着重本年四至六月和七至九月的指标，有些地区可以是一九五四——五五年度的指标），向群众宣传粮食统购统销的好处和“定产、定购、定销”的重要作用，说明“定产、定购、定销”和整顿粮食统销工作的一致性，说明国家粮食销售的情况，分析本区、本乡粮食供应中的不合理现象；然后通过乡人民代表大会和各种群众会议，通过党员、团员、干部和积极分子的模范行动，有领导地发动群众进行讨论和评议，调整和纠正供应工作中的不合理现象。综合某些地区整顿粮食统销工作的初步经验，各地可根据实际情况，采取下述作法：第一，因为时间紧迫，应在省委的统一领导和具体指导下，以县为整顿粮食统销工作的指挥重点，集中一切力量，用很短的时间，开好三级干部会议；在会上除了向干部讲明前边说的内容和要求，使干部掌握整顿粮食统销工作的精神以外，并应切实提供本区、本乡的具体情况，根据国家销售指标，合理地确定或调整各区、各乡的粮食销售指标。第二，工作到达乡村以后，采取由党内到党外、由干部到群众、由先进到落后的层层示范和层层发动的办法，首先打通党员的思想，然后打通乡人民代表、乡人民委员、村级以上干部和积极分子的思想。接着召开乡人民代表大会和乡人民委员会，运用群众的语言，当地的事例，说明整顿粮食统销工作的重要性，讨论和通过本乡的改进粮食统销工作的计划。这些工作做了以后，每个乡就可以有几十个以至百多个懂得政策、搞通了思想的人。通过这些人在群众中酝酿、讨论、协商和评议，彻底摸清情况，分清真正缺粮和并不缺粮的界线，缩减不合理的供应量，保证对缺粮户的供应。
    整顿粮食统销工作是为了切实保证缺粮农民的供应，使那些不缺粮而要求供应的农民不再盲目叫嚷，并把那些不该供应的部分核减下来。至于那些在前一个时期多买了粮食的人，如果自愿把多买而没有消耗的粮食退出一部分，这是应该允许的。但是，在整顿粮食统销工作中，必须反对强迫余粮户再卖一次余粮，以免形成对中农利益的侵犯。对于还有余粮的农民，除了他们和缺粮户之间的互通有无以外，只能由他们自愿拿到国家粮食市场上自由出卖，调剂农村供需，不得进行任何干涉。在整顿粮食统销工作中，必须正确地贯彻阶级路线，很好地团结和教育中农；对个别挑拨破坏、乘机捣乱的地主、富农和反革命分子，必须给予应有的打击和斗争。
    现在正是青黄不接的季节，我们必须抓紧时机，迅速而有效地解决农村粮食供应中存在的问题，坚决把粮食销售量控制在合理的水平上，并为下一年度的粮食销售工作准备一个良好的开端。
