　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th Dispatch from TASS: The Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, delivered a report on the 7th in Berlin at the rally celebrating the tenth anniversary of Germany's liberation.

　　In his report, Grotewohl first expressed his gratitude to the Soviet army and the Soviet people for liberating Germany from the tyranny of Hitlerite fascism.

　　Grotewohl then pointed out that due to the anti-people policies pursued by Western imperialist countries, the Bonn separatist government was established in the autumn of 1949. The democratic and patriotic forces in eastern Germany had to take measures of national self-salvation and established the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949—the foundation of a unified, democratic, independent, and peaceful Germany. This was a turning point in German history.

　　Today, the German Democratic Republic is a bastion of peace and true democracy in Germany, a pillar of security, and the homeland of workers, peasants, and all progressive laborers.

　　Grotewohl then spoke of the important significance of German-Soviet friendship. He pointed out that the Soviet Union has consistently put forward proposals for resolving the German question in accordance with the national interests of the German people at various international conferences; the Soviet Union has established relations with the German Democratic Republic as with other sovereign states; and the Soviet government's actions in helping the German Democratic Republic to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes demonstrate the Soviet Union's high degree of trust in the German Democratic Republic.

　　Grotewohl then cited many figures to illustrate the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in peaceful construction and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural lives of the working people.

　　When talking about the issue of restoring German unity, Grotewohl pointed out that only by implementing a policy of friendship and consultation can German unity be restored on a democratic basis. The government of the German Democratic Republic is still prepared to hold negotiations on all issues in order to gradually reach a solution to Germany's vital problems.

　　Grotewohl pointed out that the Soviet-Austrian negotiations prove that it is possible to resolve the German question on the basis of a peace agreement through negotiation. Austria has gained its national independence because it will not be allowed to establish any military bases on its territory or participate in unilateral military alliances. If all the prerequisites are created, the German question can also be resolved on this basis. For West Germany, this means: implementing an independent and autonomous policy and abolishing the Paris Accords.

　　Grotewohl then spoke of the principles that serve as the basis for negotiations between Germans. He said that these principles are: 1. Abolishing the Paris Accords, which is a prerequisite for restoring German unity; 2. An immediate agreement between the two parts of Germany on eliminating militarism and on free all-German elections for the National Assembly; 3. A joint request from the two parts of Germany to the four major powers to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible and to withdraw all occupation forces; 4. The establishment of a standing committee composed of representatives from both East and West Germany to study all other issues in economic, social, and cultural cooperation.

　　Grotewohl emphasized that all these are prerequisites for easing tensions and reaching agreements. However, if the American and West German militarists dare to pursue aggression plans regardless of these prerequisites, then the first step they take in this direction will be a step towards destruction.

　　Grotewohl emphasized that the working people of the German Democratic Republic will do everything in their power to protect everything they have built with their own hands. They will never allow others to take these achievements away. All preparations have been made in this regard recently.

　　The German Democratic Republic is not isolated in its struggle. It has become a part of the great world peace camp, and therefore it has the support of peace-loving people of all countries.

　　Grotewohl then spoke about the upcoming Warsaw Conference, which will discuss the issue of concluding a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance and establishing a joint supreme command of the participating countries of the treaty. He pointed out that the People's Republic of China's endorsement and firm support for the decisions in the Moscow Declaration and its sending of observers to the Warsaw Conference will strengthen the effectiveness of the Warsaw Treaty and will inspire all peace-loving people, including the German people, who are striving to safeguard peace and security. Grotewohl pointed out that the Warsaw Treaty will be a pact to block the path of aggression in Europe.

　　Grotewohl said at the end of his report that our goal is not only to ensure the existence of the German Democratic Republic and its achievements, but also to strengthen it and to thoroughly clear the way for building a socialist foundation. The war and sabotage conspiracies of American imperialism and its West German running dogs are in vain. He concluded by saying: We are advancing, advancing, with the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, until victory is achieved.

　　格罗提渥总理在柏林集会上的报告（摘要）
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社柏林八日讯：德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥七日在柏林举行的庆祝德国解放十周年大会上作了报告。
    格罗提渥在报告中首先对把德国从希特勒法西斯暴政下解放出来的苏联军队和苏联人民表示感谢。
    格罗提渥接着指出，由于西方帝国主义国家奉行反人民的政策，在一九四九年秋天建立了波恩分裂政府，德国东部的民主和爱国力量不得不采取民族自救的措施，在一九四九年十月七日成立了德意志民主共和国——统一、民主、独立和和平的德国的基础。这是德国历史上的一个转折点。
    今天，德意志民主共和国是德国的和平和真正民主的堡垒，是安全的支柱，是工人、农民和全体进步劳动者的祖国。
    格罗提渥接着谈到德苏友好的重要意义。他指出，苏联在各种国际会议上，一贯按照德国人民的民族利益提出解决德国问题的建议；苏联同德意志民主共和国已经建立了同其他主权国家一样的关系；苏联政府帮助德意志民主共和国把原子能用于和平用途的行动，表明了苏联对德意志民主共和国具有高度的信任。
    格罗提渥接着列举了许多数字来说明德意志民主共和国在和平建设方面所取得的巨大成就以及劳动人民物质和文化生活的不断提高。
    格罗提渥在谈到恢复德国统一的问题时指出，只有实行友好和协商的政策才能在民主基础上恢复德国的统一。德意志民主共和国政府仍然准备就一切问题举行谈判，以便逐渐达到解决德国的切身问题。
    格罗提渥指出：苏奥谈判证明，有可能用谈判的方法在和平协议的基础上来解决德国问题，奥地利由于将不准许在自己的领土上建立任何军事基地和不参加片面的军事联盟，就得到了自己的民族独立。如果创造了一切前提，德国问题也是可以在这样的基础上获得解决的。对西德来说，这就意味着：实行独立自主的政策和取消巴黎协定。
    格罗提渥接着谈到作为德国人之间进行谈判的基础的原则。他说，这些原则是：一、废除巴黎协定，以此作为恢复德国统一的前提；二、德国两部分之间立刻达成关于肃清军国主义和关于选举国民议会的全德自由选举的协议；三、德国两部分向四大国共同提出尽速缔结对德和约和撤退一切占领军的要求；四、成立一个由东西德双方的代表组成的常设委员会，以研究经济、社会和文化合作方面的一切其他问题。
    格罗提渥强调指出，所有这些都是缓和紧张局势和达成协议的前提。但是，如果美国和西德军国主义者不顾这些前提而胆敢推行侵略计划的话，那末他们朝这方面所走的第一步将是走向灭亡的一步。
    格罗提渥强调，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民将竭尽全力来保护他们所亲手建设的一切。他们决不允许别人夺去这些成果。最近在这方面已作了一切的准备。
    德意志民主共和国在斗争中不是孤立的。它已经成为伟大的世界和平阵营的一部分，因此它得到了各国爱好和平人民的支持。
    格罗提渥接着谈到即将举行的华沙会议，这次会议将讨论关于缔结友好合作互助条约的问题和成立条约的参加国的联合最高司令部的问题。他指出，中华人民共和国赞同并坚决支持莫斯科宣言中的决定和它将派遣观察员出席华沙会议，将加强华沙条约的效果，并将鼓舞正在为保障和平和安全而努力的包括德国人民在内的全体爱好和平的人们。格罗提渥指出，华沙条约将是一个为了堵塞欧洲发动侵略的道路的公约。
    格罗提渥在报告结尾时说，我们的目标不仅是保障德意志民主共和国的存在和它获得的成就，同时还要加强它，并为建立社会主义基础彻底扫清道路。美帝国主义及其西德走狗的战争和破坏阴谋是白费心机的。他最后说：我们高举着和平、民主和社会主义的旗帜前进，前进，一直到取得胜利。
