Sichuan has Four Natural Gas Wells Put into Production

    The Sichuan Provincial Petroleum Exploration Department has recently drilled four gas wells capable of producing large quantities of natural gas. Currently, these four wells are being tested and have been put into production in rotation. The quality of the natural gas produced is high. The transportation in the area where the gas wells are located is also very convenient.

    The natural gas produced by these gas wells has more than thirty industrial uses. It can not only be made into carbon black, an important raw material for the rubber industry, but also into synthetic gasoline, etc., and can also be used as fuel for steelmaking, power generation, and civilian use.

　　四川有四口天然气井投入生产
    四川省石油勘探部门最近钻成四口能生产大量天然气的气井。现在，这四口井在进行试气的同时，已经先后轮替投入生产。所产天然气质量高。气井所在地区的交通运输也很方便。
    这些气井生产的天然气有三十多种工业用途。它不仅可以制成橡胶工业的重要原料——碳黑，也能制成合成汽油等，还可以作为炼钢、发电、民用的燃料。　（新华社）
