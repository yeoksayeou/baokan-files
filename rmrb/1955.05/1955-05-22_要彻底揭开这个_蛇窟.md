　　To Thoroughly Expose This "Snake Den"
　　Feng Zhi
    After reading "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group," I see before me a most hypocritical, most insidious, most cruel villain. I was not familiar with Hu Feng in the past, only meeting him occasionally at meetings. He often adopted two attitudes at meetings: either sitting silently on the side, or, when he thought there was an opportunity, ranting and raving, promoting his anti-Marxist "theories" and defending his anti-Party group. I never heard him offer any constructive suggestions on the issues being discussed. At the time, I was only surprised why Hu Feng was so unconcerned with the work itself, and always so preoccupied with personal gains and losses. Subjectivity and arrogance were the impressions he gave me. But I never thought he was so dangerous, so opposed to the cause of the Party and the people.
    This hater of the Party and the people’s cause is most adept at disguises: attending gatherings of progressive writers led by the Party, he would "accompany with bows," "always going through the motions," "shaking hands with them with a smile masking contempt"; commemorating Qu Yuan, he would "accompany them in performing the Jiao Guan dance"; commemorating Lu Xun was a "disaster" for him; to Wen Yiduo, he "had to flatter him."
    This hater of the Party and the people’s cause is most insidious and cruel: he attacked the literary movement led by the Party, using weapons of "blunt blows," "rockets," "cluster grenade tactics," "a whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface." His "strategies" were diverse, sometimes "laying out a maze of doubts, making them see flags all over the mountains, and not dare to attack easily," sometimes "adding some defenses…standing firm," "being especially cautious, not underestimating the enemy," sometimes "gaining a small stronghold in the reactionary newspapers," sometimes "fighting and retreating, fighting and rolling," sometimes "resolved to share the fate of the position."
    Anyone who is insidious and cruel has the darkest inner thoughts. Because he is against the people, he feels that the people are against him; he wants to murder people, so he feels that people are "plotting to murder" him. Therefore, he feels "gloomy," feels "absolutely isolated," feels "accumulated too much resentment," feels "suffering," feels "being regarded as a heretic," feels "separated from the world," feels "unexpected heaviness," sometimes "really does not know what to do." Is this not a portrait of the inner world of all tyrants, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign?
    When writing articles, this hypocritical villain is always talking about "sincerity," and "truth"; this insidious and cruel villain is always talking about "love," and "dedication"; this anti-Party, anti-people villain often quotes phrases from Marxist-Leninist classics.
    Hu Feng himself said, "‘Such words,’ no matter how long they are used, no matter how much they are used, can equally be saying one thing and doing another, can be for deceiving and fooling people" (see "For Tomorrow," page 173). He wrote this as if "the thief is crying 'Stop thief!'" which is precisely his own confession.
    He is still using this method of "deceiving and fooling people" now. Look how warmly he calls "comrades" in his "My Self-Criticism," while in fact he harbors resentment and calls the comrades working in the literary field of the Party "officials," "imperial envoys," "masters," "young masters." How virtuous he pretends to be in this "My Self-Criticism," filled with words like "recognition," "mistakes," "understanding," "neglect," "explanation," "misinterpretation," "malignant development," as if he was really confused in the past, and suddenly understands now; in fact, he is thinking of a completely different set of things in his heart, that is, "taking the world as his responsibility," "everything is ready in me," "using others to feed himself," "feeling that a true subjectivity is running, a great will penetrates China," to "give the petty-bourgeois materialism a fatal blow," to "shake the twenty years of mechanical rule."
    We cannot tolerate such a reactionary fellow continuing to deceive and fool people in the literary circles of the new China. At the end of the postscript to "Days in the Doldrums," he wrote "Written in the Snake Den in Shanghai." He calls the place where he lives a "snake den," which is very appropriate. He and his group are just a "snake den." We must thoroughly expose this "snake den," so that the snakes in it show their true colors, lest they take advantage of people's guard, stick their heads out, and poison the people!

### 要彻底揭开这个“蛇窟”

　　要彻底揭开这个“蛇窟”
　　冯至
    我读完了“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”后，面前呈现出一个最虚伪、最阴险、最残酷的恶棍。胡风是怎样一个人，我过去是不熟悉的，只有时在开会的时候遇到他。他在会议上经常采取两种态度：不是坐在旁边一言不发，就是在他认为有隙可乘时大放厥辞，为他反马克思主义的“理论”作宣传和为他反党的集团作辩解。从来没有听到他对于讨论的问题有过什么积极性的建议。当时只惊讶胡风这个人为什么对于工作本身这样不关心，而总是斤斤计较个人的得失呢？主观和狂妄，是他给我的印象。但没有想到他是这样凶险，这样与党和人民的事业为敌。
    这个党和人民事业的仇视者是最善于伪装的：他参加党所领导的进步作家的集会，是“奉陪鞠躬”，“敷衍总是要敷衍的”，“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”；纪念屈原，是“奉陪一道跳加官”；纪念鲁迅，对他是“灾难”；对于闻一多，“只好奉承他”。
    这个党和人民事业的仇视者是最阴险残酷的：他向党所领导的文艺运动进攻，用的武器是“闷棍”、“火箭”、“集束手榴弹的战术”、“一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”。他的“战略”是多种多样的，时而“布得成疑阵，使他们看来遍山旗帜，不敢轻易来犯”，时而是“加些防卫……站得坚实”，“特别谨慎，不能轻敌”，时而在反动报纸上“得一配合的小据点”，时而是“且战且走，且打滚且作战”，时而“非抱着与阵地共存亡的决心不可”。
    凡是阴险残酷的人，他的内心里是最阴暗的。因为他与人民为敌，他就觉得人民在与他为敌；他要谋杀人，他就觉得人在“谋杀”他。所以他感到
  “阴暗”，感到“绝对孤立”，感到“积了太多的愤恨”，感到“受气受苦”，感到“被当作异端仇视”，感到“和世界离开”，感到“意料外的沉重”，有时“真不知如何是好”。这不是古今中外所有暴君的内心的写照吗？
    在写文章的时候，这个虚伪的恶棍却是张口
  “真诚”，闭口“真实”；这个阴险残酷的恶棍却是张口“爱”，闭口“献身”；这个反党、反人民的恶棍却是经常征引马克思列宁主义经典著作的词句。
    胡风自己说过，“‘这样的词句’，不论用得多么久，也不论用得多么多，那也同样可以是说的是一套、做的是相反的又一套，可以是为了欺人、骗人的”（见“为了明天”一七三页）。他这样写，有如“贼喊捉贼”，正是他自己的招供。
    这“欺人、骗人”的方法他现在还在利用。看他在他的“我的自我批判”里把“同志们”叫得多么亲热，而事实他却怀恨在心，把党在文艺方面的工作同志称为“官们”、“钦差”、“老爷们”、
  “公子们”。在这“我的自我批判”里他装得多么善良，里边充满了“认识”、“错误”、“理解”、
  “忽略”、“解释”、“曲解”、“恶性的发展”等词汇，好像他真是过去糊涂，现在忽然明白了似的；其实他心里想的完全是另外一套，那是“以天下为己任”，“万物皆备于我”，“拿别人养活自己”，
  “感到了真的主观在运行，一个大的意志贯穿了中国”，要“给市侩底唯物主义一个致命的打击”，以“动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”。
    我们不能容忍这样一个反动家伙在新中国文艺界里继续欺人、骗人了。他在“逆流的日子”后记的后边写着“记于上海蛇窟”。他把自己住的地方称为“蛇窟”，这倒很恰当，他和他的集团正好是一个“蛇窟”。我们要彻底揭开这个“蛇窟”，让其中的蛇现出原形，免得乘人不防，探出头来，毒害人民！
