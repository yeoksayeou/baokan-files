In the past semi-colonial and semi-feudal society of China, there was both the imperialist enslavement ideology reflecting imperialist rule, and the feudal restorationist ideology reflecting feudal rule. These two ideologies were different but also combined with each other. They both served the semi-colonial and semi-feudal political economy. They were both enemies of Marxism.

In liberated China, imperialism has been driven out; feudalism as a social system has been eliminated. However, the poisonous influence of these two reactionary ideologies in people's minds is still very serious. The recent criticism of Hu Shi's thought has severely hit the imperialist enslavement ideology. In order to remove obstacles on the road to socialism, the feudal restorationist ideology still needs to be thoroughly eliminated.

Mr. Liang Shuming's cultural views and "village governance" theory are typical feudal restorationist ideas.

At a time when the revolutionary mainstream of the "May Fourth" Movement against imperialism and feudalism was rising, and the feudal restorationist thought of "clinging to the old and preserving the remnants" was about to go bankrupt, Mr. Liang published his "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" in 1921 to resist feudalism, thereby becoming a representative of feudal restorationist thought at that time.

What Mr. Liang called "Eastern culture" and "Western culture" are actually the cultures of feudal society and bourgeois society. These two societies are two stages of social development, but Mr. Liang juxtaposes them, believing that the cultures of these two societies are manifestations of two "philosophies."

In his book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," Mr. Liang believes that "a culture is just the various aspects of a nation's life" (page 10). He also believes, based on the Buddhist idealist worldview, that "life is endless desire... and that constant satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Being a nation, being a life, why has the way of life it manifests become two different colors? It's just that the desires that are the original cause of the way of life have branched out in two different directions, so what is developed is different" (page 24). He believes that the direction of desire can only have three kinds, so there can only be three kinds of attitudes to life, three kinds of philosophy, and only three kinds of culture, or, in Mr. Liang's words, mankind can only have three "paths." The first path, Western culture, "takes the desire to demand forward as its fundamental spirit" (same as above). The second path, "Chinese culture," "takes the desire to harmonize oneself, holding the middle as its fundamental spirit." The third path, Indian culture, "takes the desire to turn back and demand as its fundamental spirit" (page 55). This is taking an abstract "desire" as the driving force of history, as the determining cause of social development, and using the so-called "direction" of "desire" to explain the different social natures of Western bourgeois society and Chinese and Indian feudal societies. This completely idealist view of history cannot explain anything. Even if we accept Mr. Liang's statement, we still do not know: "Being a nation, being a life," being a "desire," why do some want to "go forward," some want to "hold the middle," and some want to "go backward."

He subjectively arranged a historical program that "should" develop. According to him: mankind should first finish the first path, then take the second path; finish the second path, then take the third path. According to this program: the culture of the first path is lower-level, the culture of the second path is higher-level, and the culture of the third path is the highest-level. Therefore, the Eastern feudal culture is not lower than the Western bourgeois culture, but higher than it.

Why has the East failed everywhere after contacting the West? According to him, this is precisely because Eastern culture is too high, so in the current world, it is "out of date," "taken out too early" (page 199). Therefore, his method is: "To fully accept Western culture, and fundamentally change it, that is, to change its attitude: critically bring out China's original attitude again" (page 202). He said: "The current Western ideological circles have clearly demanded to change their inherent attitude to life; and what they demand to tend towards is the Chinese road, the Confucian road" (page 177). According to him, once the two sides come together like this, Chinese feudal culture will become world culture.

War and economic crises were originally inevitable diseases of capitalist society developing to the stage of imperialism. During the First World War, even some bourgeois thinkers felt the seriousness of this disease, but they did not dare to look forward, unwilling to admit that the deepening of this disease was a precursor to the transformation of bourgeois society to socialist society, but instead looked backward, wanting to find a way out from ancient culture. This was a very weak countercurrent, but the supporters of Chinese feudalism exaggerated it. Liang Qichao took a trip to Europe after the First World War and came back to declare that Europeans believed that "the end of the world, the extinction of civilization is coming soon." "It is better to have this Chinese Shangri-La, there is still a way. This is a glimpse of the psychology of the majority of Europeans" ("Yinbingshi Zhuanji" No. 23). Mr. Liang Shuming's statement that Westerners want to take the "Chinese road, the Confucian road" is based on this kind of false, Ah Q-style propaganda.

The way out that Mr. Liang pointed out to China seems to be extremely vague and abstract, but it actually has its concrete content. It is not a "illusory" "castle in the air," but a theoretical foundation for a practical reactionary fortress.

In order to resist the development of the revolutionary situation, Mr. Liang developed a set of "village governance" theories and methods, directly protecting feudalism in theory and action. In this struggle, Mr. Liang in his book "Rural Construction Theory" actualized and concretized the vague and abstract theories in the book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," and finally concluded in his book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture."

According to his cultural "three paths" theory, in his opinion, the characteristic of Chinese culture is the so-called "harmony" and "holding the middle." This is what he calls "the application of the second attitude to life." The characteristic of this "application" is "yielding to others," "so the word 'yielding' has become a great spirit of the Chinese people. It corresponds to the spirit of 'struggle' of Westerners from the first attitude. And the result seen in facts is one is mutual concession, and the other is strife" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement" page 88).

Therefore, Mr. Liang believes that "China is a society based on ethics." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture" page 84) He said: "An ethical society is a society that values ​​friendship. Conversely, in Chinese society, we see affection between each other everywhere, while in Western society, we see a situation of people opposing each other everywhere. Not only the people oppose their government, the workers oppose their owners, but even husband and wife are also opposed to each other" (same as above, page 96). "What an ethical society values ​​is respect for the other party" (same as above, page 97). Originally, in bourgeois society, the capitalist's exploitation of workers is nakedly exposed; therefore, class struggle is more intense and more obvious. Mr. Liang, however, believes that "mutual strife" is only a characteristic of Western culture. "Respecting each other" (same as above), "mutual concession" is the "ethics" used by the rulers of feudal society to anesthetize the people. Mr. Liang, however, regards it as the "essentials of Chinese culture," "re-bringing it out" in an attempt to continue to anesthetize the people, so that the people and the reactionary "government" at that time, the peasants and the landlords, the workers and the owners "respect each other." That is to say, calling on the people not to revolt against the reactionary "government" at that time, and the peasants and workers not to struggle against the landlords and capitalists. This is what Mr. Liang said in "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" about "critically bringing out China's original attitude."

Mr. Liang also believes that in Chinese feudal society, there is no "class opposition" at all, only "different occupations." He said: "The four classes of scholars, peasants, artisans, and merchants were originally different occupations that make up this vast society. They live together, cooperate with each other, separated, they become class opposition, while connected, they become a sign of occupational cooperation and mutual need" ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture" page 170). In Chinese feudal society, most of the "scholars" were landlords and gentry; "peasants" were the objects of landlord exploitation, but Mr. Liang believed that "there is a natural connection between them" (same as above). In Chinese feudal society, there were bosses and apprentices among the artisans, and capitalists and shop assistants among the merchants, which is class opposition. But Mr. Liang ignored these facts and insisted that there were no classes in China.

Mr. Liang used these distorted views as the theoretical basis of his "village governance." He spent a lot of effort proving that his "Rural Construction Theory" conforms to the tradition of Chinese feudal culture. In fact, this does not need to be proven, because he was originally using the so-called "harmonious philosophy" of the Chinese feudal landlord class to anesthetize the peasants, continue to anesthetize the peasants, and try to prevent them from resisting and revolting. According to Mr. Liang's cultural theory, culture only has particularity, not generality; Chinese culture is special, therefore all revolutionary theories cannot be applied to China. He pointed out "Our first impassable road in politics - the road of modern European democratic politics; our second impassable road in politics - the road invented by the Russian Communist Party; our first impassable road in economics - the road of modern European capitalism. Our second impassable road in economics - the road that the Russian Communist Party wants to take" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement" page 108). That is to say, whether it is a bourgeois revolution or a proletarian revolution, it will not work in China, because China is special. China can only preserve what he calls Chinese culture, namely feudal culture.

Therefore, Mr. Liang put forward "The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement." This is his "village governance" method and theory, the essence of which is to establish landlord armed forces in the countryside to protect feudal order, and also attempt to use a set of so-called education and cooperation systems to anesthetize the peasants, in order to counter the peasant movement led by the Chinese Communist Party, oppose communism, and oppose revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "The feudal landlord class is the main social basis for imperialist rule in China, while the peasants are the main force of the Chinese revolution. If we do not help the peasants overthrow the feudal landlord class, we cannot form a strong team for the Chinese revolution and overthrow imperialist rule." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") "The armed struggle of the Chinese Communist Party is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat." ("Preface to 'The Communist'") The Chinese revolution followed this correct line and achieved the current great victory.

In the face of the great power of the peasant war led by the Chinese Communist Party, the landlord class trembled. Mr. Liang led them to carry out a "self-salvation movement." Mr. Liang mentioned three reasons for the rise of the rural construction movement, one of which is "starting from the rural self-salvation movement"; "the first step of its work is to prevent direct destruction, and armed self-defense must be carried out against the harassment of bandits, red bandits, and miscellaneous troops" ("Rural Construction Theory" page 10).

Mr. Liang also said: "Indeed, the Communist Party kills and sets fires, and its harm is almost the same as that of bandits (Note: This is completely repeating the reactionary slander against the Communist Party); but in fact this problem is not that simple. This is indeed a big problem in Chinese society, and it is not enough to solve it by simply seeking local defense." "From a certain point of view, the Communist Party's actions are actually a kind of peasant movement in China." "If you want to eliminate the Communist Party's peasant movement, there must be another kind of peasant movement to replace it" ("Rural Construction Theory" page 279-280). Mr. Liang openly stated that the main purpose of his "village governance" was to compete with the Chinese Communist Party for leadership among the peasants, attempting to replace the revolutionary peasant movement led by the Chinese Communist Party against the landlord class with his reactionary "peasant movement" supporting the landlord class.

Mr. Liang said: "Their (the Communist Party) peasant movement first creates a kind of differentiation in rural society, making rural society a situation of separation and confrontation, and struggle occurs within rural society." (Same as above) As for him, he believes that the countryside is a whole. That is to say: the peasant movement led by the Chinese Communist Party is to awaken the class consciousness of the peasants, organize them, lead them, fight the landlords, and embark on the road to liberation; while Mr. Liang's "peasant movement" blurs the peasant class consciousness, deceiving them saying: "The countryside is a whole," and "unifies" both the exploiters and the exploited in this general "whole."

Chairman Mao said: "In the long and cruel national liberation war, in the great struggle to build a new China, the Communist Party must be good at absorbing intellectuals in order to organize a great anti-Japanese force, organize millions of peasant masses, develop the revolutionary cultural movement, and develop the revolutionary united front. Without the participation of intellectuals, the victory of the revolution is impossible." ("Absorb a Large Number of Intellectuals") From the beginning, the Chinese Communist Party combined Marxist-conscious intellectuals with the worker movement, led the peasants, united the intellectuals, and achieved today's great victory.

Mr. Liang not only wanted to compete with the Chinese Communist Party for the peasants, but also wanted to compete with the Chinese Communist Party for the intellectuals. He said, "The solution to the Chinese problem, from its initiation to its completion, depends entirely on the force constituted by the intellectuals and rural residents in society working together" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement" page 208). He wanted the intellectuals to follow him, "The revolutionary intellectuals must go to the countryside, work together with the rural residents and drag them up" (same as above, page 215). He explained that he deliberately avoided the terms "peasants," "peasant workers," "oppressed people," and "proletariat," and used the term "rural residents," believing that this general term could indicate that the countryside is "a whole," "There are problems internally, but it is appropriate to leave them for the next step to solve" (same as above, page 216). Mr. Liang's "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" attempts to prove that the Chinese countryside is "a whole," and from this he said: "Today's Chinese society needs to be reorganized and transformed, not a class revolution; the status of peasants needs to be improved, not to turn over with a fluke mentality (referring to land distribution and rent reduction, etc.) to lead the peasants, and with a mentality of hatred and jealousy (referring to class struggle) to leave a legacy to society, it is not the way to build a new society" ("Rural Construction Theory" page 284). Mr. Liang's method is to "let everyone recognize the true relationship with each other, in order to enhance the relationship with each other, put everyone in a kind of mutual love and friendship, mutual respect; in common encouragement in the upward direction of life to solve our living problems" (same as above, page 197). Mr. Liang concealed the exploitation relationship between landlords and peasants in the countryside, believing that in addition to this, there is the so-called "true relationship," and wanted them to have no "hatred and jealousy," to cherish each other, and to anesthetize the peasants with the elusive term "life upward," calling on them not to strive for material interests (see page 283). Mr. Liang said: "This is the Chinese peasant movement, and it is also our rural construction movement. With this movement, other peasant movements will not be needed, and the Communist Party can be without" (same as above, page 284).

This is also the "group organization" that Mr. Liang requires, "its organizational principle is based on the Chinese ethical meaning; it seems that in addition to the five relationships of father and son, ruler and minister, husband and wife, friends, and brothers, there is also a relationship between the group and the individual, and the individual and the group... The entire organization is a group organization of Chinese spirit, so it is said to be mainly based on the inherent spirit of China and absorb the strengths of Westerners" (same as above, page 175). If we understand Mr. Liang's terminology, the so-called Chinese spirit is the spirit of feudalism, this sentence reveals his true intentions.

The interests of the feudal landlord class are mainly in agriculture. Therefore, they all demand that agriculture be put first, oppose capitalism, and oppose industrialization. Mr. Liang's "village governance" theory also reflects this demand. At that time, Japanese imperialism advocated the so-called "Sino-Japanese cooperation," "agricultural China, industrial Japan." This was precisely to turn China into a place for Japan to supply raw materials and dump goods, that is, to turn China into a Japanese colony. But Mr. Liang thought this was a good opportunity. He said, "He (the Japanese) hopes that cotton production in North China will develop, but does not want the textile industry to develop." This is "still letting us off one step in agriculture" (same as above, page 375, 376). Then let's engage in agriculture! But this is also embarking on the road to complete colonization.

Speaking of this, Mr. Liang thanked imperialism. He said, "Imperialism, with unequal treaties and various economic means, has suppressed China's competition and prevented the rise of China's industry and commerce, making China avoid capitalistization. This is a very fortunate thing, I would like to thank God." "In this way, it just leaves a little room for China's agriculture, it is really a coincidence." "In this way, we have the opportunity to talk about rural construction today. Otherwise, like Russia, forming a half-baked industrial country, it is most suitable for a communist revolution to occur; then, we cannot talk about rural construction today, but have to talk about communism!" He was glad that the changes in the past few decades "are still superficial, not reaching the bones." "Economic facts have not changed much," not embarking on the "new path" of "industrial capitalism," "The suffering is here; the good is also here. If the economic facts change, then the whole thing changes. If the new path goes up, it will never come back, and it will never be able to go the road we want to take" (same as above, page 378, 379). That is to say, if there were no imperialism, Chinese feudalism would have been eliminated long ago, and "village governance" would not have time to maintain it.

Mr. Liang said: "To rely on agriculture to seek liberation" (same as above, page 384), "To start industry from agriculture is our way to liberation" (same as above, page 387). What to do before "starting industry"? Mr. Liang believes that we still have to rely on imperialism. Mr. Liang said: "In fact, international capital imperialism originally focuses on economic aggression; we have been deeply and long invaded by him, so on the one hand, we suffer more and more, and on the other hand, we rely on him more and more. It is like smoking opium, the deeper and longer the addiction, the more the body is injured, and the more inseparable from him. Therefore, if he suddenly withdraws his economic aggression methods, we will panic and cannot support it; instead, we will beg him 'Please still invade me!'" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Movement" page 184). Therefore, he believes that imperialism is not a real object of revolution (same as above, page 185). He approves of Hu Shi's statement defending imperialism, he said: "Mr. Hu Shi does not care about overthrowing imperialism, but only creates his theory of the five great devils, although the statement is inevitably a little clumsy, but it is not without its reasons" (same as above, page 209).

In colonial and semi-colonial societies, imperialism and feudalism are interdependent and interact with each other. This fact is clearly reflected in Mr. Liang's thoughts. Mr. Liang once opposed our socialist industrialization policy, which is the inevitable result of his thinking.

　　批判梁漱溟先生的文化观和“村治”理论
　　冯友兰
    在过去中国半殖民地半封建社会里，有反映帝国主义统治的帝国主义奴化思想，也有反映封建主义统治的封建主义复古思想，这两种思想是有区别而又互相结合的。它们都是为半殖民地半封建的政治经济服务的。它们都是马克思主义的敌人。
    在解放了的中国，帝国主义已被赶走了；封建主义作为一种社会制度已被消灭了。但是这两种反动的思想，在人们的头脑中的流毒，还是很严重的。近来对于胡适思想的批判，严重地打击了帝国主义奴化思想。为了扫除走向社会主义道路上的障碍，封建主义复古思想也还是有待肃清的。
    梁漱溟先生所宣传的文化观和“村治”理论就是典型的封建复古主义思想。
    正在“五四”运动反帝国主义、反封建主义的革命主流日益高涨，“抱残守缺”的封建主义复古思想快要破产的时候，梁先生于一九二一年发表了他的“东西文化及其哲学”为封建主义抵挡一阵，由此成为当时封建主义复古思想的代表。
    梁先生所谓“东方文化”“西方文化”，其实就是封建社会文化和资产阶级社会文化。这两种社会是社会发展的两个阶段，可是梁先生把它们平列起来，认为这两种社会的文化是两种“哲学”的表现。
    在他的“东西文化及其哲学”这个著作里，梁先生认为“一家文化不过是一个民族生活的种种方面”（页十）。他又根据佛教的唯心主义世界观，认为“生活就是没尽的意欲……和那不断的满足与不满足罢了。通是个民族，通是个生活，何以他那表现出来的生活样法成了两异的采色？不过是他那为生活样法最初本因的意欲分出两异的方向，所以发挥出来的便两样罢了”（页二四）。他认为，意欲的方向，只可能有三种，因此只可能有三种人生态度，三种哲学，也只可能有三种文化，或者用梁先生的名词，人类只能有三条“路向”。第一条路向，西洋文化，“是以意欲向前要求为根本精神的”（同上）。第二条路向，“中国文化”，“是以意欲自为调和，持中为其根本精神的”。第三条路向，印度文化，“是以意欲反身向后要求为其根本精神的”
  （页五五）。这是把一个抽象的“意欲”作为历史的推动力，作为社会发展的决定原因，并且以所谓
  “意欲”的“方向”来说明西洋资产阶级社会和中国、印度封建社会的社会性质的不同。这种完全唯心的历史观并不能说明什么问题。就算我们承认梁先生的说法吧，我们还是不知道：“通是个民族，通是个生活”通是个“意欲”，为什么有的要“向前”，有的要“持中”，有的要“向后”。
    他主观地排出了一个历史“应该”发展的程序。照他说：人类应该是先走完了第一条路，再走第二条路；走完了第二条路，再走第三条路。照这个程序说：走第一条路的文化，是较低级的，走第二条路的文化，是较高级的，走第三条路的文化是最高级的。所以东方的封建主义文化，并不是比西方的资产阶级文化低，而是比它高。
    为什么东方跟西方接触以后，处处失败呢？照他的说法，这正是因为东方文化太高了，所以在现在的世界，“不合时宜”，“拿出的太早了些”（页一九九）。因此他的办法是：“对于西方文化是全盘承受，而根本改过，就是对其态度要改一改：批评的把中国原来态度重拿出来”（页二○二）。他说：“现今西方思想界已彰明的要求改变他们从来人生态度；而且他们要求趋向之所指就是中国的路，孔家的路”（页一七七）。照他的说法，这么双方一凑合，中国的封建文化，就成为世界文化了。
    战争、经济危机等本来是资本主义社会发展到帝国主义阶段的不可避免的病症。在第一次世界大战的时候，甚至有些资产阶级的思想家，也感觉到这种病症的严重性，可是他们不敢向前看，不肯承认这种病症的加深是资产阶级社会要向社会主义社会转变的预兆，反而向后看，想从古代文化中寻找出路。这是一个很微弱的逆流，可是中国的封建主义的拥护者，把它夸大起来。梁启超在第一次世界大战后到欧洲跑了一趟，回来就宣称说：欧洲人认为“世界末日，文明灭绝的时候快到了”。
  “倒不如这世外桃源的中国，还有办法。这就是欧洲多数人心理的一斑了”（“饮冰室专集”之二十三）。梁漱溟先生所说西洋人要走“中国的路，孔家的路”就是以这一类的虚伪的，阿Q式的宣传为根据的。
    梁先生指给中国的出路，好像是极空泛抽象，但其实是有其具体的内容。它不是一种“虚无缥渺”的“空中楼阁”，而是一种实际的反动堡垒的理论基础。
    为了反抗革命形势的发展，梁先生发展了一套
  “村治”的理论和办法，在理论上和行动上直接保护封建主义。在这个斗争中，梁先生在他的“乡村建设理论”一书中把“东西文化及其哲学”一书中的空泛抽象的理论实际化具体化，最后归结为他的
  “中国文化要义”一书。
    根据他的文化“三条路向”的说法，照他的意见，中国文化的特点是所谓“调和”“持中”。这就是他所谓“人生第二态度之应用”。这个“应用”的特点是“屈己让人”，“故‘让’字遂为中国人之一大精神。与西洋人由第一态度而来之‘争’的精神，正相映对。而其结果见于事实者，一为互让，
  一则为交争”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”页八八）。
    因此梁先生认为“中国是伦理本位的社会”。
  （“中国文化要义”页八四）他说：“伦理的社会就是重情谊的社会。反之，在中国社会处处见彼此相与之情者，在西洋社会却处处见出人与人相对之势。非唯人民与其政府相对，劳工与其业主相对，甚至夫妇两性亦且相对”（同上，页九六）。“伦理社会所贵者曰尊重对方”（同上，页九七）。本来在资产阶级社会中，资本家对于工人的剥削关系，赤裸裸地暴露出来；因此阶级斗争也就更剧烈、更显著。梁先生却把“互争”认为只是西洋文化的特点。“互以对方为重”（同上），“互让”，是封建社会统治者麻醉人民的“伦理”。梁先生却把它认为是“中国文化要义”，把它“重新搬出来”企图继续麻醉人民，使人民与当时的反动“政府”，农民与地主，劳工与业主“互以对方为重”。就是说，叫人民不要对当时的反动“政府”进行革命，农民、工人不要对地主、资本家进行斗争。这就是梁先生在“东西文化及其哲学”中所说的“批评的把中国原来态度重拿出来”。
    梁先生又认为在中国封建社会中，根本没有“阶级对立”，只有“职业分途”。他说：“士农工商之四民原为组成此广大社会之不同职业。彼此相处，彼此配合，隔则为阶级之对立，而通则职业配合相需之征也”（“中国文化要义”页一七○）。在中国封建社会中，大多数的“士”就是地主、绅士；
  “农”是地主剥削的对象，可是梁先生认为“其间一脉浑然相通而不隔”（同上）。在中国封建社会中，工之中有老板与学徒，商之中有资本家与伙计，这就是阶级对立。可是梁先生不管这些事实，硬说中国没有阶级。
    梁先生就把这些歪曲事实的见解，作为他的
  “村治”的理论基础。他费了很大的气力证明他的
  “乡村建设理论”是符合于中国封建文化的传统的。其实这倒是无需证明的，因为他本来就是用中国封建地主阶级麻醉农民的所谓“调和哲学”，继续麻醉农民，企图使他们不要反抗，不要革命。照梁先生的文化论，文化只有特殊性，没有一般性；中国文化是特殊的，因此一切革命的理论，都不能适用于中国。他指出“我们政治上的第一个不通的路——欧洲近代民主政治的路；我们政治上的第二个不通的路——俄国共产党发明的路；我们经济上的第一个不通的路——欧洲近代资本主义的路。我们经济上的第二个不通的路——俄国共产党要走的路”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”页一○八）。那就是说，无论资产阶级革命或无产阶级革命，在中国都是行不通的，因为中国特殊。中国只可以保守着他所谓中国文化，即封建文化。
    于是梁先生就提出了“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”。这就是他的“村治”的办法和理论，其本质就是在乡村中建立地主武装，保护封建秩序，又企图用一套所谓教育和合作制度，麻醉农民，以对抗中国共产党所领导的农民运动，反对共产主义，反对革命。
    毛主席说过：“封建地主阶级是帝国主义统治中国的主要社会基础，而农民则是中国革命的主力军，如果不帮助农民推翻封建地主阶级，就不能组成中国革命的强大队伍而推翻帝国主义的统治。”
  （“中国革命和中国共产党”）“中国共产党的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导之下的农民战争。”
  （“‘共产党人’发刊词”）中国革命就是循着这个正确的路线而达到现在的伟大的胜利的。
    在中国共产党所领导的农民战争的伟大力量的前面，地主阶级发抖了。梁先生就领导他们作“自救运动”。梁先生说到乡村建设运动所由起的三个原因，其一是“起于乡村自救运动”；“其工作第一步就要防止直接的破坏，对于土匪赤匪和杂牌军队的骚扰，必须武装自卫”（“乡村建设理论”页十）。
    梁先生又说：“诚然，共产党杀人放火，其为害亦与土匪差不多（按：这完全是重复反动派对共产党的诬蔑之词）；但实际上这个问题不是这末简单。这确是中国社会的大问题，单讲求地方保卫不足以解决”。“自某一意义上来看，共产党的作为，实是中国的一种农民运动”。“要想消除共产党的农民运动，必须另有一种农民运动起来替代才可以”（“乡村建设理论”页二七九——二八○）。梁先生公开地说明，他的“村治”的主要目的，就是同中国共产党争夺在农民中的领导权，企图以他的拥护地主阶级的反动的“农民运动”替代中国共产党所领导的反抗地主阶级的革命的农民运动。
    梁先生说：“他们（共产党）的农民运动是在乡村社会里首先作一种分化的工夫，使乡村社会成为分离对抗的形势，在乡村社会之内就发生斗争。”（同上）至于他则认为乡村是一整个的。这就是说：中国共产党所领导的农民运动，是唤起农民的阶级觉悟，组织他们，领导他们，斗争地主，走上翻身的大路；而梁先生的“农民运动”则模糊农民阶级意识，欺骗他们说：“乡村是一整个的”，把剥削者和被剥削者都“统一”在这个笼统的“整个”之中。
    毛主席说过：“在长期的和残酷的民族解放战争中，在建立新中国的伟大斗争中，共产党必须善于吸收知识分子，才能组织伟大的抗战力量，组织千百万农民群众，发展革命的文化运动和发展革命的统一战线。没有知识分子的参加，革命的胜利是不可能的。”（“大量吸收知识分子”）中国共产党一开始就是由有马克思主义觉悟的知识分子和工人运动相结合，领导农民，团结知识分子，而达到今日的伟大的胜利。
    梁先生不但想要同中国共产党争农民，也想要同中国共产党争知识分子。他说，“中国问题之解决，其发动主动以至于完成，全在其社会中知识分子与乡村居民打并一起，所构成之一力量”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”页二○八）。他要知识分子跟着他走，“革命的知识分子要下乡间去，与乡间居民打并一起而拖引他上来”（同上，二一五页）。他说明他特意避免“农民”“农工”“被压迫民众”“无产阶级”等名词，而用“乡村居民”这个名词，认为这个笼统的名词可以表示乡村是“一整个”“内部非无问题，然宜留待后一步解决”（同上，页二一六）。梁先生的“中国文化要义”企图证明中国乡村是“一整个”，由此他说：“今日中国社会需要整理改造，而不是阶级革命；农民地位需要增进，而不是翻身以侥幸心理（指分地减租等）领导农民，以仇忌心理（指阶级斗争）留贻社会，更非所以建设新社会之道”（“乡村建设理论”页二八四）。梁先生的办法是，要“大家认识了彼此的真关系，以求增进彼此的关系，把大家放在一种互相爱惜情谊中，互相尊重中；在共同相勉于人生向上中来求解决我们的生活问题”（同上，页一九七）。梁先生掩盖了乡村中地主对农民的剥削关系，认为除此之外，还有所谓“真关系”，要叫他们中间没有“仇忌心理”，互相爱惜，用“人生向上”这一个不可捉摸的名词，麻醉农民，叫他们不要争取物质的利益
  （参看页二八三）。梁先生说：“这就是中国的农民运动，亦就是我们的乡村建设运动。有此运动而后其他的农民运动才用不着，共产党才可以没有”
  （同上，页二八四）。
    这也就是梁先生所要求的“团体组织”“其组织原理就是根据中国的伦理意思而来的；仿佛是在父子、君臣、夫妇、朋友、兄弟这五伦之外，又添了团体对分子、分子对团体一伦而已。……整个组织即是一个中国精神的团体组织，所以说是以中国固有精神为主而吸收了西洋人的长处”（同上，页一七五）。我们若了解了梁先生的术语，所谓中国精神就是封建主义的精神，这句话倒是说出了他的本心。
    封建地主阶级的利益，主要是在农业。因此他们都要求把农业放在第一位，反对资本主义，反对工业化。梁先生的“村治”理论中也反映了这个要求。当时日本帝国主义鼓吹所谓“中日合作”，
  “农业中国，工业日本”。这正是要把中国变成日本的原料供给和商品倾销的地方，也就是把中国变为日本的殖民地。可是梁先生倒认为这是好机会。他说：“他（日本人）希望华北棉产发达，而不愿意纺织业发达”。这是“于农业尚可放过我们一步”
  （同上，页三七五、三七六）。那我们就搞农业吧！可是这也就是走上完全殖民地化的道路。
    话说到这里，梁先生就感谢帝国主义了。他说：“帝国主义以不平等条约和种种经济手段，对于中国的竞争压迫，杜绝了中国工商业的兴起，使中国免于资本主义化，这真是非常庆幸之事，我愿谢天谢地。”“这样，恰好给中国农业留下一点活动余地，真是很巧的事。”“这样，才留给我们今天讲乡村建设的机会。要不然，像俄国那样，形成一个半通不通的工业国家，最适宜于发生共产革命；那么，我们今天就不能讲乡村建设，而得讲共产主义了！”他庆幸几十年来的变化，“到底还是皮毛，没有达到骨子”。“经济事实则未十分变”，没走上“工业资本主义化的”“新路子”，“苦就苦在这里；好亦好在这里。假若经济事实变了，则整个变了。假若新路子走上去的话，就再回不来，再亦不能去走我们理想要走的路”（同上，页三七八、三七九）。这就是说，假若没有帝国主义，中国的封建主义早就消灭了，“村治”想维持它也来不及了。
    梁先生说：“要凭借农业谋翻身”（同上，页三八四），“从农业引发工业是我们翻身之路”（同上，页三八七）。还没有“引发工业”的时候，怎么办呢？梁先生认为还是要靠帝国主义。梁先生说：“盖事实上，国际资本帝国主义原重在经济的侵略；我们受他侵略既深且久，固一面吃亏愈大，而一面亦愈依赖于他。好似吸鸦片烟一般，烟瘾愈深且久，身体愈伤，而愈离不了他。所以他若将其经济侵略手段一旦骤然撤回，我们便大起恐慌，支撑不住；反而要哀恳于他‘请你还是侵略我罢！’”（“中国民族运动之最后觉悟”页一八四）。所以他认为帝国主义不是真正革命的对象（同上，页一八五）。他赞成胡适为帝国主义辩护的说法，他说：“胡适之先生于打倒帝国主义不置意，而独创其五大魔之说，虽立言不免稍笨，而正非无所谓也”（同上，页二○九）。
    在殖民地半殖民地的社会，帝国主义和封建主义是互相依附，交互为用的。这个事实，在梁先生的思想中，得到明确的反映。梁先生曾经一度反对我们社会主义工业化的方针，这是他的这种思想的必然的结果。
