　　The Struggle to Restore German Unification Continues
　　Gao Ji
    The Paris Agreements of the American aggressor bloc and its followers to rearm West Germany have been implemented. West German militarist forces are openly taking steps to rebuild Hitler's "Wehrmacht," and West Germany is becoming a base for deploying large numbers of aggressive troops. This increases the danger of a new war and deepens the division of Germany.

    The German people, who have been twice dragged into wars of aggression by militarist forces, know deeply that the path of reviving German militarism will once again lead to immense disaster for Germany. Therefore, all German patriots resolutely oppose the implementation of the Paris Agreements, demand that the German question be resolved through negotiation, that German democratic unification be achieved, and that Germany embark on the path of peaceful development.

    Of course, the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements have created a new and unfavorable situation for the German people in their struggle to restore national unification and to resolve the German question through negotiation. However, in the current international situation, there are also favorable factors for resolving the German question and restoring German unification through negotiation. The possibility of resolving the German question in accordance with the wishes of the German people and in the interests of consolidating peace in Europe and the world has not been exhausted by far.

    The Soviet Union, which bears important responsibility for resolving the German question, has resolutely and consistently strived for a peaceful solution to the German question. Soviet Premier Bulganin clearly pointed out in his speech at the recent Warsaw Conference: "The Soviet Union has been and remains a resolute and consistent opponent of the policy of re-militarizing West Germany. ... At the same time, we have been and remain in favor of restoring Germany as a unified, free, peaceful, and democratic state." He also said: "The Soviet government will continue to do its best to promote the restoration of German unity and to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany on an acceptable basis." In its May 11 proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war, the Soviet government advocated that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France should immediately withdraw their occupation forces from Germany, and that local police forces with strictly limited personnel should be established in the two parts of Germany, as well as joint four-power supervision to implement this agreement. At the same time, the Soviet government also welcomed the four powers to withdraw their troops from German territory and to take any other steps to facilitate the solution of the German question in the interests of European security and to make Germany a unified, peaceful, and democratic country. Obviously, the implementation of these Soviet proposals will help to ease international tensions and build mutual trust between the countries concerned and between the two parts of Germany, thereby paving the way for the four powers and the two parts of Germany to resolve the German question through negotiation and restore German unification.

    The Soviet Union's consistent and firm policy on the German question has been fully supported by all countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, as well as by peace-loving people all over the world. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance recently signed in Warsaw by European peace-loving countries, which has received full support from the People's Republic of China, is the crystallization of the consistent policy of the socialist camp countries on the German question and the issue of ensuring European security. This treaty is a great help to the German people's efforts to unify Germany in a peaceful and democratic manner. The treaty reaffirms the desire of the contracting states to establish a European collective security system with the participation of all European countries, in order to jointly ensure European peace. The establishment of a European collective security system can guarantee the independence and security of all European countries, large and small, and also help accelerate the restoration of German unification.

    The conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty shows that as long as the parties concerned show sincerity in solving the problem, it is entirely possible to peacefully resolve the outstanding European issues through negotiation. Because Austria has declared that it will remain neutral forever, will not allow the establishment of military bases on its territory, will not participate in any military alliances, and because the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to this status maintained by Austria in international relations, the agreement on the Austrian State Treaty has been reached, making Austria a fully independent country again. The resolution of the Austrian question cannot but attract the attention of a wide range of people in Germany. Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, said: When the sun of independence is rising in Austria, dark shadows are descending on Germany with the implementation of the Paris Agreements. The German people are now demanding that the German question be resolved according to the precedent of resolving the Austrian question. Fair public opinion in Western European countries also points out that resolving the German question according to the principles of resolving the Austrian question is also in line with the interests of the security of other European countries. This common aspiration expressed by the German people and public opinion in Western European countries cannot be ignored.

    The task of achieving the peaceful unification of Germany depends first and foremost on the efforts of the patriotic forces of the German people themselves. In his report at the Berlin rally celebrating the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Germany on May 7, Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic pointed out when talking about the Austrian question: "If we create all the prerequisites, the German question can also be resolved on such a basis." The German Democratic Republic is a reliable fortress for the German people to strive for the peaceful unification of the country. Its position has been further strengthened by the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. At the Warsaw Conference where this treaty was signed, Premier Grotewohl stated: "The German Democratic Republic still believes that unifying Germany based on the principles of peace and democracy is its primary task, the task of all the German people. It will do everything in its power to promote the early restoration of German unification." He also said: "The government of the German Democratic Republic signed this Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on the premise that a unified Germany will not be bound by any obligations undertaken by either part of Germany under any military or political treaty or agreement concluded before German unification." This means that the German Democratic Republic's participation in the Warsaw Treaty is based on promoting German unification rather than strengthening division, and does not hinder a unified Germany from pursuing an independent and autonomous policy. The German Democratic Republic's firm policy of fighting for the restoration of German unification represents the interests of all the German people and powerfully encourages the German people's confidence in fighting for the restoration of national unification. In West Germany, despite the Bonn ruling clique's ratification and commencement of the implementation of the Paris Agreements, the West German people's struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements and demanding that representatives from both East and West Germany promptly consult on the restoration of national unification is still continuing, and its strength is constantly growing. In the state parliamentary elections in six states of West Germany over the past year, the position of the Christian Democratic Union, which has vigorously advocated the implementation of the Paris Agreements and the policy of re-militarization, has continued to decline. The number of votes it received has decreased by a total of 2.7 million compared with the 1953 general election, while the number of votes received by West German parties that oppose the implementation of the Paris Agreements and advocate restoring German unification through negotiations has greatly increased. This is powerful proof. The growth of the patriotic forces of the West German people striving for the restoration of national unification is an important factor in achieving the task of a unified Germany.

    The facts are very clear that resolving the German question through negotiation and restoring German unification is the common aspiration and demand of all German patriots, and it is also the consistent proposition of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world. Achieving this task is necessary and possible. However, the American ruling clique and its West German followers, for the benefit of monopoly capitalists, are unwilling to see a peaceful, unified, and independent Germany, and are doing their best to prevent the development of the German people's movement demanding the restoration of national unification. On the one hand, they spread absurd remarks, opposing the Soviet Union's proposal for the immediate withdrawal of the four countries' occupation forces and the restoration of German unification, opposing making Germany neutral like Austria, and at the same time, they have stepped up the implementation of the Paris Agreements, attempting to establish the backbone of the first batch of "Bundeswehr" in West Germany as early as July this year, in order to create a fait accompli of West German rearmament, hindering the peaceful resolution of the German question and restoring the hotbed of war in West Germany. This approach of the American aggressor bloc and its followers increases the danger of the situation. Therefore, the patriotic forces in Germany will conduct a more extensive and all-out struggle to oppose the implementation of the Paris Agreements, and they are demanding the abolition of these agreements in order to completely remove the obstacles on the road to restoring German unification.

　　恢复德国统一的斗争还在继续
　　高集
    美国侵略集团及其追随者重新武装西德的巴黎协定已经付诸实施。西德军国主义势力已在公开采取步骤重建希特勒的“国防军”，西德正在变成一个部署大量侵略军的基地。这增加了新战争的危险，并加深了德国的分裂。
    曾经被军国主义势力两次投入侵略战争的德国人民深深地知道，复活德国军国主义的道路将再一次导致德国的莫大灾难。因此，所有德国的爱国者都坚决反对实施巴黎协定，要求通过协商的方式解决德国问题，实现德国的民主统一，并使德国走上和平发展的道路。
    当然，巴黎协定的批准和实施已为德国人民争取恢复国家的统一和协商解决德国问题造成了一种新的不利的局势。但是，在目前的国际局势中，也存在着通过协商方式解决德国问题和恢复德国统一的有利的因素。按照德国人民的愿望和巩固欧洲以及世界和平的利益来解决德国问题的可能性，还远没有丧尽。
    对于解决德国问题负有重要责任的苏联坚决一贯地为和平解决德国问题而努力。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在最近举行的华沙会议上的发言中曾明确指出：“苏联曾经是而且依然是西德重新军国主义化政策的一个坚决的、一贯的反对者。……同时，我们曾经而且现在仍旧支持把德国恢复成为一个统一的、自由的、和平的和民主的国家。”他又说：“苏联政府将来也还是愿意尽力促进恢复德国的统
  一，并促进在可以接受的基础上同德国缔结和约。”在五月十一日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议中，苏联政府主张苏、美、英、法四国应立刻撤退它们在德国的占领军，并主张在德国两部分建立员额有严格限制的地方警察部队，以及为了执行这个协定建立四国的共同监督。同时苏联政府还表示欢迎四国为了从德国领土上撤退自己的军队和为了便于按照欧洲安全和使德国成为一个统一、和平、民主的国家的利益而采取任何其他步骤。很显然，实现苏联的这些建议，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和树立有关国家之间和德国两部分之间的相互信任，从而也将为四国之间和德国两部分之间协商解决德国问题、恢复德国的统一打开道路。
    苏联在德国问题上的这种一贯的、坚定的政策，得到了和平、民主和社会主义阵营所有国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持。欧洲爱好和平国家最近在华沙签订的、得到中华人民共和国全力支持的友好合作互助条约，就是社会主义阵营国家在对德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题上的一致政策的结晶。这个条约对德国人民争取以和平和民主方式统一德国的努力，是一个巨大帮助。这个条约重申缔约国家希望在欧洲所有国家参加的基础上建立欧洲集体安全体系，以便联合它们的努力来保障欧洲和平。建立欧洲集体安全体系可以使欧洲一切大小国家的独立和安全得到保障，也有助于加速恢复德国的统一。
    奥地利国家条约的缔结表明，只要有关方面表现解决问题的诚意，通过协商来和平解决欧洲悬而未决的问题，是完全可能的。由于奥地利宣布永远保持中立，不准在自己的领土上建立军事基地，不参加任何军事同盟，并且苏、美、英、法四国同意奥地利在国际关系中所保持的这种地位，这样就取得了奥地利国家条约的协议，使奥地利恢复成为完全独立的国家。奥地利问题的解决不能不引起德国广泛阶层人士的注意。西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔就说：当独立的太阳正在奥地利升起的时候，黑暗的阴影正随着巴黎协定的实施而降临在德国头上。德国人民现在要求按照解决奥地利问题的先例来解决德国问题。西欧各国的公正舆论也都指出，按照解决奥地利问题的原则来解决德国问题，也符合于欧洲其他国家的安全的利益。德国人民和西欧各国舆论所表示的这种共同的愿望是不容忽视的。
    实现德国和平统一的任务，首先取决于德国人民本身的爱国力量的努力。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥五月七日在柏林庆祝德国解放十周年大会上所作的报告中谈到奥地利问题时曾指出：“如果我们创造了一切前提，德国问题也是可以在这样的基础上获得解决的。”德意志民主共和国是德国人民争取国家的和平统一的可靠堡垒。它的地位因缔结了友好合作互助条约而更加强固了。在签订这个条约的华沙会议上格罗提渥总理声明：“德意志民主共和国仍然认为，根据和平和民主的原则统一德国是它的主要任务，是全体德国人民的任务。它将尽一切力量来促使德国早日恢复统一。”并且说：“德意志民主共和国政府签订这个友好合作互助条约是从这样的前提出发：统一后的德国将不受德国两部分的任何一部分根据在德国统一前缔结的任何军事或政治条约或协定所承担的任何义务的约束。”这就是说，德意志民主共和国参加华沙条约是以促进德国的统一而不是以加强分裂为出发点的，并且丝毫不妨碍统一后的德国执行独立自主的政策。德意志民主共和国坚决为恢复德国的统一而斗争的方针，代表了全德国人民的利益，它有力地鼓舞着德国人民为争取恢复国家的统一而斗争的信心。在西德，尽管波恩统治集团批准并开始实施巴黎协定，但是西德人民反对实施巴黎协定、要求迅速由东西德双方代表会商恢复国家统一的斗争还在继续，并且它的力量在不断增长。一年来，在西德六个州的州议会选举中，极力鼓吹实施巴黎协定和重新军国主义化政策的基督教民主联盟的地位不断下降，它所得的选票比起一九五三年大选时共减少了二百七十万张，而反对实施巴黎协定和主张通过谈判恢复德国统一的西德的政党所得的选票有了很大的增加。这就是很有力的证明。西德人民争取恢复国家统一的爱国力量的增长，是实现统一德国的任务的重要因素。
    事实很清楚，通过谈判解决德国问题和恢复德国的统一，是全体德国爱国者的共同愿望和要求，也是苏联和其他欧洲爱好和平国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的一致主张。实现这个任务是必要的，也是可能的。但是美国统治集团及其西德的追随者为了垄断资本家的利益，不愿意看到德国和平统一和独立，正在竭力阻止德国人民要求恢复国家统一的运动的发展。他们一面散布荒谬言论，反对苏联关于立即撤退四国占领军、恢复德国统一的建议，反对使德国像奥地利一样维持中立，同时并加紧了实施巴黎协定的步骤，企图在今年七月就建立起西德的第一批“国防军”的骨干部队，以便造成西德重新武装的既成事实，阻挠德国问题的和平解决而恢复西德的战争温床。美国侵略集团及其追随者的这种做法，增加了局势的危险性。因此，德国的爱国力量必将进行更加广泛的、全力的斗争，来反对巴黎协定的实施，他们正在要求废除这一协定，以彻底扫除恢复德国统一道路上的障碍。
