　  Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th dispatch: According to TASS, the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a joint meeting on the 4th to discuss the Soviet Council of Ministers' proposal, submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet for examination, regarding the abolition of the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in December 1944. The meeting was chaired by Suslov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union.
　  Zorin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the abolition of the aforementioned treaty.
　  During the discussion of this report, Skobeltzyn, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union, and Surkov and Seleznev, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of Nationalities, all spoke. Chairman Suslov concluded by saying: In view of France's direct violation of the obligations it has undertaken, the speakers unanimously supported the Soviet Council of Ministers' proposal to abolish the Franco-Soviet Treaty. Suslov said that everyone understands that the French ruling circles' participation in arming West Germany, which poses a direct threat to the security of all European countries, and participation in a military alliance with the involvement of West German militarism, has thus abolished the Franco-Soviet alliance and nullified its stipulated objective of taking joint action to prevent the resurgence of German threat. However, this policy of the French ruling circles can never shake our conviction: the French people, with their heroic traditions and high political consciousness, will actively fight for peace and for the independence of their country.
　  The Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities approved the proposal of the Soviet Council of Ministers and decided to recommend that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union abolish the Franco-Soviet Treaty, which has already become ineffective.

    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院外交委员会举行联席会议
　  决定建议最高苏维埃主席团废除法苏条约
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会四日举行联席会议，讨论苏联部长会议提交苏联最高苏维埃主席团审查的关于废除一九四四年十二月签订的法苏条约的建议，会议由最高苏维埃联盟院外交委员会主席苏斯洛夫担任主席。
    苏联外交部副部长佐林作了关于废除上述条约的报告。
    在讨论这个报告时，联盟院外交委员会委员斯科贝尔琴、民族院外交委员会委员苏尔科夫、谢列平等人都发了言。主席苏斯洛夫最后总结说：鉴于法国直接破坏它自己所承担的义务，发言者们一致支持苏联部长会议关于废除法苏条约的建议。苏斯洛夫说，大家都明白，法国统治集团参加对所有欧洲国家的安全产生直接威胁的武装西德的工作，参加有西德军国主义参加的军事同盟，从而废除了法苏联盟和取消了它所规定的目的在防止德国威胁再起而采取联合行动的义务。然而法国统治集团这一政策永远也不能动摇我们的信念：有着英雄传统和高度政治觉悟的法国人民，将积极地为争取和平、争取自己国家的独立而斗争。
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院外交委员会批准了苏联部长会议的建议，并且决定建议苏联最高苏维埃主席团废除已经失效的法苏条约。
