　　State-owned Commerce Must Accelerate Capital Turnover
　　Chen Shi, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce
    In recent years, state-owned commerce has achieved considerable success in expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, supplying exports, stabilizing the market, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, and ensuring the needs of the people. However, the slow capital turnover of state-owned commerce is a serious problem. For example, in 1952, the turnover of all funds in state-owned commerce was 1.8 times. Although it accelerated by 0.33 times in 1953 compared to 1952, the estimated capital turnover in 1954 was 0.17 times slower than the actual performance in 1953. The growth rate of capital is greater than the growth rate of sales, which is also unreasonable. For example, in 1954, sales only increased by 27.42% compared to 1953, while capital increased by 34.97%, resulting in an overstock of 848,559,000 yuan of state funds. At the same time, the occupation of non-commodity funds is also increasing year by year. For example, with the end of 1952 as 100, it increased to 110.08 in 1953, and is expected to increase to 172.37 in 1954, occupying 455,860,000 yuan more state funds than in 1953.

    The reasons for the slow capital turnover of state-owned commerce are: On the one hand, state-owned commerce is responsible for arranging the market and carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce. The scope of unified purchase and sales of materials has expanded, and the state must have more abundant materials, thus increasing average inventory through purchase, concentration, and year-round supply. The expansion of advance purchase of agricultural products in 1954 also increased capital occupation. On the other hand, the following shortcomings still exist in the operation and management of state-owned commerce:

    1. Some regions have blind purchasing, repeated purchasing, and lax acceptance of processed goods. Some unsalable commodities have to be stockpiled for a long time, occupying capital and preventing turnover. For example, in 1954, the Hunan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company purchased silver nitrate that could be sold for two or three years. 80% of the commodities in the Hubei Provincial Hardware Company's inventory in 1954 were not suitable for local needs. Due to blind processing and ordering and lax acceptance of goods, the Shanghai Hardware and Machinery Company suffered large-scale stockpiling and losses of "steel hammers."

    2. The state-owned commercial system also has blindness in commodity allocation, which not only wastes freight and affects supply, but also causes long-term stockpiling of commodities, or shortages in one place and overstocking in another. For example, the Xikang Provincial Department Store transferred mercerized blue cloth and worker-peasant blue cloth to Ganzi in 1953. Because they were not suitable for sales, they were transferred back from Ganzi in 1954. In the fourth quarter of last year, some areas transferred bicycles to mountainous areas in order to support the purchase of agricultural products. Submarine cables and marine telescopes were transferred to the interior. This wasted a lot of funds.

    3. The sales plan was not completed, especially the planned supply or planned sales of goods failed to complete the plan, which stockpiled state funds, increased interest expenditure, and seriously affected the speed of capital turnover. For example, in 1954, some units had an unclear understanding of the policy of unified purchase and sales, and produced the idea of ​​"the less you sell, the better," which made it impossible to complete the sales plan. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company sold 153,470,000 yuan less according to the plan in 1954, and the Oil Company sold 35,700,000 yuan less according to the plan. In addition, some commodities have been stored in warehouses for a long time and cannot meet customers, which is also a factor that makes it impossible to complete the sales plan.

    4. Due to the lax financial supervision and settlement system of the state-owned commercial system, unreasonable commercial credit has gradually increased, and non-commodity funds lack quota management, which has increased the occupation of state funds. In 1954, although the state-owned commercial system cleared up arrears of internal and external payments and stopped selling on credit to cooperatives, some regions decided to continue to generate new commercial credit on their own due to the decentralization of materials in the fourth quarter. In addition, the advance purchase funds for agricultural products cannot be fully recovered as scheduled, and bad debts have even occurred in some areas, so the settlement work with cooperatives is not timely, resulting in increased capital occupation. The phenomenon of arrears of internal payments in the state-owned commercial system continued to develop at the beginning of 1955. Except for the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, which has implemented a new credit system that adapts credit to actual inventory, the remaining companies still implement the method of balancing financial revenue and expenditure (the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Food Company also implement the treasury recall system), so it is difficult to accurately calculate the increase or decrease in funds, and the idea of ​​"wide budgeting and narrow use" has been generated in the preparation of plans for non-commodity funds. In addition, the financial plan and the commodity circulation plan are not connected enough, and the contract and the plan are often disconnected. These seriously affect the speed of capital turnover.

    5. The property management of some enterprise units in state-owned commerce is relatively chaotic, and the phenomenon of inconsistency between accounts and goods still exists. At the same time, due to poor management and some staff members' lack of a sense of responsibility, capital turnover is also affected. In 1954, the total property loss of state-owned commerce nationwide reached 55,125,300 yuan, an increase of more than 22,090,000 yuan compared with 1953. Among them, the losses from "commodity overconsumption" and "fines and compensation" are the largest.

    The state must concentrate its main efforts on heavy industry construction. It is not only impossible to allocate more working capital to state-owned commerce, but state-owned commerce needs to accumulate funds for the state. The 1955 plan stipulates that the growth rate of commodity turnover should be greater than the growth rate of capital. State-owned commerce must accelerate the turnover of fixed capital in 1955 by 0.215 times compared to 1954 (estimated), saving the state more than 1,007,280,000 yuan. In order to complete this task, state-owned commerce must do the following:

    1. Strengthen the planning of processing orders and purchases, and overcome the practice of blindly purchasing and allocating goods regardless of market needs. This requires constant investigation and research on the needs of production and the people, and strict acceptance of purchased goods, so as to assist and urge industrial departments to continuously improve products in accordance with production conditions and the needs of the people. The internal commodity allocation of state-owned commerce must be carried out according to economic zoning and take into account traffic conditions, so that commodities can quickly reach the demanding units at low cost, so as to reduce the time of commodities in transit. At the same time, it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of blind allocation without regard to local market needs, so as to avoid commodity stockpiling.

    2. Strive to complete or exceed the 1955 sales plan. In the work of commodity supply, it is necessary to give full play to the power of existing materials. For planned supply and planned sales of goods, the sales plan must be completed, and the conservative idea of ​​reluctant sales that does not follow the plan must be resolutely opposed. For general commodities, vigorous sales should be carried out. All varieties stored in the warehouse should be brought to the counter to meet customers, and the phenomenon of out-of-stock counters while warehouses have goods in the past should be overcome.

    3. Financial supervision of state-owned commerce must be strengthened. First of all, the level of financial analysis must be improved. Through financial analysis, problems and unreasonable phenomena in the use of funds must be discovered and corrected in a timely manner. Secondly, the economic accounting system should continue to be promoted, with the focus on steadily promoting the new credit system. The experience of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company in implementing the new credit system should be carefully summarized, and promoted within the four company systems of petroleum, chemical industry, monopoly, and cotton yarn and cloth in 1955. Companies that have not implemented the new credit system should improve the settlement work on the basis of the current credit methods, and implement settlement loans and direct settlement methods. The scope of commercial credit should be delineated, the sale of goods on credit to cooperatives should be stopped, accounts receivable and payable should be reduced, and the phenomenon of arrears of payments within state-owned commerce should be eliminated. The work of purchasing agricultural products should be improved. The funds for purchasing agricultural products should be directly loaned by cooperatives to banks, and they should be responsible for the settlement work, so as to reduce the occupation of settlement funds.

    4. Strengthen property management, and earnestly implement the unified accounting system. Overcome the phenomenon of inconsistencies between accounts and goods. And resolutely fight against acts of corruption, waste, and theft of state property.

    State-owned commerce must actively and steadily promote the economic accounting system, strengthen financial supervision, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, summarize and promote advanced experience, so as to accelerate capital turnover, reduce the occupation of non-commodity funds, and complete the task of accumulating funds for the country's socialist industrialization.

### 国营商业必须加速资金周转

　　国营商业必须加速资金周转
　　商业部财务局副局长　陈实
    几年来，国营商业在扩大城乡物资交流、供应出口、稳定市场、促进工农业生产发展、保证人民需要上已获得了不少成绩。但是，国营商业资金周转迟缓的现象是很严重的。如一九五二年国营商业全部资金周转为一点八次，一九五三年虽比一九五二年加速了零点三三次，但到一九五四年预计资金周转又比一九五三年的实绩慢了零点一七次。资金增长的速度大于销货额增长的速度，这也是不合理的。如一九五四年销货额仅比一九五三年增加百分之二十七点四二，而资金却增加了百分之三十四点九七，因而多积压国家资金八亿四千八百五十九万元。同时非商品资金的占压也是逐年增大的。如以一九五二年末为一百，一九五三年则增为一百一十点零八，一九五四年预计增加为一百七十二点三七，比一九五三年多占压了国家资金四亿五千五百八十六万元。
    造成国营商业资金周转缓慢的原因：一方面是由于国营商业担负着安排市场和对资本主义商业进行社会主义改造的任务，统购统销物资的范围扩大，国家必须掌握较充实的物资，因而收购集中、常年供应、使平均库存增大；一九五四年扩大对农产品的预购，也使资金占压增加。另一方面则是由于国营商业的经营管理上还存在下面许多缺点：
    一、有些地区存在盲目进货、重复进货以及加工商品验收不严等现象。有些不合销路的商品不得不长期积压起来，占压着资金不能周转。如一九五四年湖南省医药公司一次购进的硝酸银可供二、三年销售；湖北省五金公司一九五四年库存商品有百分之八十不适合当地需要；上海五金机械公司由于盲目加工订货，商品验收不严，致使“钢鎯头”大量积压和损失。
    二、国营商业系统在商品调拨上也存在盲目性，不但浪费了运费，影响了供应，而且造成商品长期积压，或者造成此处积压彼处脱销的现象。如西康省百货公司一九五三年调运甘孜的丝光青布、工农蓝布，因为不适合销路，又在一九五四年从甘孜调回；去年第四季度有的地区为了支持农产品收购，竟把自行车调到山区；海底电缆、海上望远镜调到内地，这样浪费的资金就很多。
    三、销售计划没完成，特别是计划供应或按计划出售的商品没完成计划，就积压了国家资金，多支出了利息，严重地影响了资金周转的速度。如在一九五四年曾有某些单位对统购统销的政策认识不清，产生了“越少卖越好”的惜售思想，使销售计划不能完成。花纱布公司一九五四年按计划少销了一亿五千三百四十七万元，油脂公司按计划少销三千五百七十万元。另外有些商品长期压在仓库里不能同顾客见面，也是造成不能完成销售计划的因素。
    四、由于国营商业系统财务监督和结算制度不严，不合理的商业信用逐渐增加，非商品资金缺乏定额管理，因此加大了国家资金的占用。一九五四年国营商业系统虽然清理了内部、外部货款的拖欠，对合作社停止了赊销，但由于第四季度物资下放，有些地区又自行决定继续发生新的商业信用。此外，对发放的农产品预购资金，不能如期全部收回，部分地区甚至发生呆账的现象，因而对合作社的结算工作也不及时，以致资金占压增加。国营商业系统内部货款拖欠的现象在一九五五年初仍继续发展。除煤业建筑器材公司已实行信贷同实际库存商品相适应的新信贷制度外，其余公司还执行着财务收支轧差的办法（花纱布、食品两公司还实行金库回笼制度），因而在资金增减额度的计算上很难准确，对非商品资金的计划编制即产生了“宽打窄用”的思想。再加上财务计划和商品流转计划衔接不够，合同和计划也经常脱节。这些都严重影响了资金周转的速度。
    五、国营商业某些企业单位的财产管理工作是比较紊乱的，账账、账货不符的现象仍然存在，同时由于经营管理不善，某些工作人员责任心不强，也影响了资金周转。一九五四年全国国营商业财产损失共达五千五百一十二万五千三百元，较一九五三年增加了二千二百零九万多元。其中以“商品超耗”和“罚款及赔偿”的损失最大。
    国家要集中主要力量进行重工业建设，不仅不可能给国营商业增拨更多的流动资金，而且需要国营商业为国家积累资金。一九五五年计划规定商品流转额增长比例大于资金增加比例。国营商业必须使一九五五年的定额资金周转较一九五四年（预计）加速零点二一五次，为国家节约资金十亿零七千二百八十多万元。为了完成这个任务，国营商业必须做好以下几项工作：
    一、加强加工订货和收购的计划性，克服不顾市场需要，盲目收购和盲目调拨商品的做法。这就必须经常不断地调查研究生产和人民的需要，并对收购的商品进行严格的验收工作，以协助和督促工业部门按照生产条件和人民的需要不断地改进产品。国营商业内部的商品调拨，必须按经济区划进行，并照顾到交通条件，使商品能在费用低廉的情况下迅速到达要货单位，以减少商品在途时间。同时，必须克服不根据当地市场需要而进行盲目调拨的现象，以免商品积压。
    二、努力完成或超额完成一九五五年的销售计划。在商品供应工作上必须充分发挥现有物资的力量。对计划供应的和按计划出售的商品，必须完成销售计划，坚决反对不按计划销售的保守惜售思想；对一般商品，应大力推销，凡仓库中存有的品种都应拿到柜台同顾客见面，克服过去仓库有货而柜台脱销的现象。
    三、国营商业的财务监督必须加强。首先，必须提高财务分析工作水平，通过财务分析发现和及时纠正资金运用上存在的问题和不合理现象。其次，要继续推行经济核算制，其重点是稳步地推行新的信贷制度。应该认真总结煤业建筑器材公司实行新信贷制度的经验，一九五五年内在石油、化工、专卖、花纱布四个公司系统内推广。在未推行新信贷制度的公司，要在现行信贷办法的基础上改进结算工作，实行结算贷款和直达结算办法。要划分商业信用的范围，停止对合作社的赊销，减少应收应付账款，消除国营商业内部的货款拖欠现象。改进农产品收购工作，农产品收购资金均由合作社直接向银行贷款，并负责结算工作，以减少结算资金的占用。
    四、加强财产管理工作，认真贯彻执行统一会计制度。克服账账、账货不符现象。并同贪污、浪费和盗窃国家财产的行为作坚决的斗争。
    国营商业必须积极地稳步地推行经济核算制，加强财务监督，认真学习苏联的先进经验，总结和推广先进经验，以加速资金周转，减少非商品资金的占压，完成为国家的社会主义工业化积累资金的任务。
