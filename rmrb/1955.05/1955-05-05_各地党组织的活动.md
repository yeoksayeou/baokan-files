　　Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions
　　Oppose "Black Meetings"
　　Strictly controlling meetings and ensuring that workers have sufficient time for rest and recreation has become an important task for Party organizations in factories and mines.
　　In the past, the meetings at the Wuhan Universe Cigarette Factory were not only numerous, but also long, seriously affecting the rest and recreational activities of the workers. The Party organization of this factory, together with the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, unified the scheduling of meeting times, and all the workers welcomed this practice.
　　However, comrades who were accustomed to using meetings to carry out their work felt that this method was not good. Not only could they not hold meetings casually, but even if a meeting was approved, the meeting time could not be too long, and they could no longer make lengthy reports. So these comrades came up with a new method: holding meetings secretly. The workers were against this practice and called these meetings "black meetings."
　　With "black meetings," some meetings that should have been held could not be held. For example, one day at noon, the Party General Branch convened a meeting of propagandists according to the unified schedule, but the number of people attending was very small. Although the Third Branch had twenty-four propagandists, only five attended; the First Branch had twenty-three propagandists, but only nine attended. It turned out that two "black meetings" were being held at the same time that noon: the Third Branch of the Communist Youth League was holding a meeting of League members, and the administration was also holding a meeting on tobacco leaf fermentation work. Most of the propagandists were pulled to attend the "black meetings."
　　The Party General Branch criticized the comrades who held "black meetings," and the "black meetings" gradually decreased. (Qi Min)

　　Ideological Work Should Be Done This Way
　　In the factory workshop of the Xin Zhan Locomotive Depot in Jilin Province, temporary motor repairs occurred sixteen times in the past November, seriously affecting locomotive operation and the completion of the depot repair rate. The workshop branch investigated this situation and found that the main reason was that Sun Risheng, a motor repair worker, had financial difficulties, was in a bad mood, did not seriously study his profession, and often made mistakes in his work.
　　The workshop branch suggested that the trade union help Sun Risheng solve his financial difficulties and sent him to other places to learn advanced experience. After Sun Risheng returned from his studies, the branch immediately had an individual conversation with him to encourage him to use the advanced experience he had learned. Sun Risheng was in high spirits. Based on the motor maintenance experience of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot and combined with the specific conditions of the factory, he compiled a maintenance scope and operation process table and established a motor quality record book. In this way, maintenance was carried out in a planned and prepared manner, improving the quality of the motors.
　　Sun Risheng encountered many difficulties in using advanced experience: such as insufficient tools and untimely supply of materials. The branch promptly suggested that the administration add these things, which further increased Sun Risheng's confidence. Sun Risheng used waste materials to repair and match two spare parts, which prevented the temporary repair of five motors in the first quarter of this year.
　　When Sun Risheng proposed a rationalization proposal to change asbestos rope to expansion rings, and the administration did not promptly support it, his mood became a little depressed. The branch immediately assigned a comrade to help him study this issue. During the experiment, the branch continued to encourage Sun Risheng, strengthening his determination to overcome difficulties. Sun Risheng's experiment was finally successful. Since then, there have been no more temporary or minor motor repairs in the factory workshop of the Xin Zhan Locomotive Depot, ensuring the normal operation of the locomotives.

　　Supervise the Implementation of Labor Regulations
　　Supervising and ensuring the implementation of internal labor regulations in state-owned factories is an important task of Party organizations in state-owned factories. The Beiguan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shenyang City paid attention to leading the Party organizations in various state-owned and local state-owned factories, and carried out propaganda and education on labor regulations to Party members and workers, so that Party members and the masses realized that the formulation of labor regulations is an effective measure to organize normal production and ensure the completion of production tasks, and therefore actively participated in the formulation of the draft outline of internal labor regulations of their respective enterprises.
　　However, the Beiguan District Committee also found that some factory Party organizations had not paid enough attention to this work and handed it over to the trade union or a small number of cadres in the personnel department; some factory Party organizations did not thoroughly publicize the significance and purpose of this work to Party members and the masses. Individual cadres also engaged in commandism in their work. In order to correct these deviations, the Beiguan District Committee convened a meeting of full-time cadres of Party organizations in state-owned and local state-owned factories in the district. After affirming the achievements, it criticized various incorrect understandings and practices and put forward correct working methods. The Propaganda Department of the District Committee also specifically convened a meeting of propaganda cadres, introducing the experience of the Party organization of the Shenyang Machinery Iron Factory in publicizing and implementing labor regulations, which gave the Party organizations of various factories a model to learn from. At present, ten state-owned and local state-owned factories in the district have basically completed the formulation of internal labor regulations for their respective enterprises, and some units have begun to implement them in actual work. The labor discipline of many units has begun to improve, ensuring the completion of production tasks. (Tian Feng)

　　Correctly Handle Surplus Labor and Livestock
　　What to do with surplus labor and livestock? Some members of the Xuri No. 2 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Weishahe Village, Linjiang County, Jilin Province, advocated developing sideline occupations, and some even advocated planting less grain crops and more potatoes to open a flour mill to solve this problem. The Party organization certainly did not agree with this approach. The Party organization conducted persuasive education to the members, explaining the significance of increasing grain production, and explaining that the fundamental method to solve the current surplus labor and livestock should be to focus on developing agricultural production, implementing technological reforms, and developing diversified economies according to their capabilities. After patient education, the members had a correct understanding of planting grain crops according to the national plan and solving surplus labor and livestock. On this basis, the Party organization also mobilized the members to explore the potential for agricultural production increase, formulated an agricultural production plan, and decided to start from carrying out year-round fertilizer accumulation, improving soil, picking stone lattices, digging drainage ditches, and managing vegetable fields, to solve the problem of surplus labor and livestock. (Jiang Zhenyu)

　　Learn Tibetan Well and Do a Good Job
　　The Tongren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Qinghai Province recently held a Tibetan language training class, specially transferring Han and Hui cadres at the county, district, and township levels to learn Tibetan.
　　The comrades who participated in the training class had encountered many difficulties in their work in the past because they did not know Tibetan or did not speak Tibetan well. This time, everyone's learning enthusiasm was very high. Zhao Qingxi, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative, was one of them. He only came to Tongren last October. Because he did not understand the language, he did not do his job well. After participating in the training class, he was very enthusiastic about learning.
　　The study committee of the training class also thought of many ways to consolidate everyone's learning enthusiasm and achievements during the study. For example, they compiled a "Tibetan-Chinese Handbook," compiled teaching materials, and published Tibetan language learning clappers, etc. The result of the training was very good. Thirteen people who originally did not understand Tibetan at all can now understand some Tibetan; those who originally had some conversational foundations can now do ordinary translation.

　　各地党组织的活动
　　反对“黑会”
    严格地控制会议，保证职工有足够的时间休息和娱乐，这已成为厂矿党组织的一项重要工作。
    过去，武汉市宇宙烟厂的会议不但多，而且会议的时间长，严重地影响了职工的休息和文娱活动。这个厂的党组织就同行政、工会、青年团统一安排了会议时间，全体职工是欢迎这一作法的。
    但是，习惯于用会议来进行工作的同志，就觉得这个办法不好，不但不能随便开会，而且即使被批准开会，会议时间也不能太长，不能再作长篇大论的报告。于是这些同志又想出一个办法：偷偷摸摸地开会。职工们是反对这种作法的，都把这种会议叫做“黑会”。
    有了“黑会”，有些应该开的会议，就开不成了。例如，有一天中午，党总支按统一安排召开宣传员会议，可是到会的人数非常少。第三分支部虽然有二十四个宣传员，但只到了五个；第一分支部有二十三个宣传员，但只到了九个。原来这天中午同时出现了两个“黑会”：青年团第三分支部正在召开团员会议，行政也在召开烟叶发酵工作会议。大多数宣传员都被拉去参加“黑会”了。
    党总支对这些开“黑会”的同志进行了批评，“黑会”就逐渐减少了。　（启民）
　　应该这样做思想工作
    吉林省新站机务段工厂车间，在去年十一个月中，发生电机临时修十六次，严重影响了机车运用和段修率的完成。车间分支部调查了这一情况，发现主要是电机修理工人孙日升生活困难，情绪不好，没有认真钻研业务，工作中时常出现错误。
    车间分支部建议工会帮助孙日升解决生活困难的问题，并派他到外地学习先进经验。孙日升学习回来后，分支部立刻找他个别谈话，鼓励他运用所学的先进经验。孙日升的情绪很高，他根据丰台机务段电机检修经验，结合本厂具体情况，编制了检修范围和作业过程表，并建立了电机质量记载簿。这样，做到有计划、有准备地养护维修，提高了电机质量。
    孙日升在运用先进经验时，曾碰到不少困难：如工具不足，材料供应不及时等。分支部就及时建议行政增添这些东西，这就更加提高了孙日升的信心。孙日升利用废料修配了两台备品，在今年第一季度就防止了五台电机的临时修。
    当孙日升提出把石棉绳改为涨圈的合理化建议，行政方面没有及时地予以支持时，他的情绪就有点消沉，分支部立刻指定了一个同志去帮助他研究这个问题。在试验过程中，分支部又不断地鼓励孙日升，坚定他克服困难的决心。孙日升的试验终于成功了，以后新站机务段工厂车间，再没有发生过电机临时修或小修的现象，保证了机车正常的运用。　（吉林铁路新站地区检查组）
　　监督劳动规则的贯彻
    监督和保证国营工厂内部劳动规则的贯彻，是国营工厂党组织的重要任务。中共沈阳市北关区委注意领导各国营和地方国营工厂党组织，向党员和职工进行了有关劳动规则的宣传教育，使党员和群众都认识到制定劳动规则是组织正常生产、保证生产任务完成的有效措施，因而积极地参加制定本企业内部的劳动规则纲要草案。
    但是北关区委也发现有些工厂党组织对这一工作还没有引起足够的重视，把它交给工会或人事部门少数干部去做；也有的工厂党组织没有深入地向党员和群众宣传这一工作的意义和目的。个别干部在工作中还发生了命令主义。为了纠正这些偏向，北关区委就召开全区国营和地方国营工厂党组织的专职干部会议，在肯定成绩后，即批判了各种不正确的认识和做法，提出了正确的工作方法。区委宣传部又专门召开了宣传干部会议，介绍了沈阳机械铁工厂党组织宣传贯彻劳动规则的经验，这使各工厂党组织有了学习的榜样。目前，全区已有十个国营、地方国营工厂基本上完成了本企业内部劳动规则的制定工作，有的单位已开始贯彻到实际工作中去，许多单位的劳动纪律开始好转，保证了生产任务的完成。　（田丰）
    正确处理剩余劳力畜力
    有了剩余劳动力和畜力怎么办呢？吉林省临江县苇沙河村旭日第二农业生产合作社有些社员主张开展副业，甚至有人主张少种粮谷作物，多种土豆子开粉坊来解决这个问题。党组织当然不同意这种做法。党组织就向社员进行了说服教育，说明增产粮食的意义，说明目前解决剩余劳动力和畜力的根本方法，应该以发展农业生产为主，实行技术改革，量力发展多种经济。经过耐心地教育，社员们对按照国家计划种植粮谷作物和解决剩余劳畜力都有了正确认识。在这个基础上，党组织又发动社员挖掘农业增产的潜力，制定了农业生产计划，并决定从进行常年积肥、改良土壤、拣石格子、挖顺水沟和经营菜田等方面着手，解决剩余劳动力和畜力的出路问题。　（蒋振玉）
　　学好藏语，做好工作
    中共青海省同仁县委最近举办了一个藏语学习训练班，专门抽调县、区、乡三级汉、回族干部学习藏语。
    参加训练班学习的同志，过去因为不会藏语或藏语说得不好，工作时感到很多困难，这次大家的学习情绪很高。供销合作社干部赵庆喜就是其中的一个。他去年十月才到同仁工作，因为语言不通，就没有做好自己的工作。参加训练班后，他学习的劲头很大。
    训练班学委会在学习中还想了不少办法，以巩固大家的学习情绪和成绩。例如编印了“藏汉语手册”，编印了教材，出版了藏语学习快板等等。训练的结果很好，原来根本不懂藏语的十三个人，现在已能听懂一些藏语；原来有些会话基础的，现在已能作普通的翻译。　（郑云洲）
