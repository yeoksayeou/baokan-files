　　Welcome the Signing of the Austrian State Treaty

    The Austrian State Treaty, which peace-loving people have long awaited, has been signed by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This is a major event in current international relations. The signing of this treaty not only restores freedom and independence to Austria but also opens up new avenues for the peaceful settlement of other outstanding international issues. It is of great significance for strengthening European security and world peace.
    The signing of the Austrian State Treaty is a great achievement of the policy of maintaining peace and striving for international cooperation. The responsibility for the Austrian problem being delayed for ten years without a solution is very clear. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated the early conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty based on safeguarding the interests of Austrian national independence and safeguarding the interests of European security, and has made unremitting efforts for this. However, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France not only delayed and obstructed the work of drafting the Austrian State Treaty but also tried to pull Austria into the Western military bloc to block the path to resolving the Austrian problem. It was only because of a series of positive steps recently taken by the Soviet Union, especially the agreements reached at the Soviet-Austrian talks, that eliminated the difficulties created by Western countries in signing the Austrian State Treaty, which promoted the successful resolution of the Austrian problem. People have seen that even in the four-power ambassadorial conference in Austria, the Western bloc, headed by the United States, was still trying to create obstacles. It was only because the Soviet Union strived for agreement with perseverance, and because the Austrian people and European peace-loving people fully demanded a solution to the Austrian State Treaty issue, that the United States and its partners had to agree to sign this treaty. These facts fully demonstrate the Soviet Union's sincerity in seeking peace and easing international tensions. At the same time, it also shows that the determination and strength of the people to strive for peace and independence cannot be ignored.
    Due to the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, Austria has regained its independence, and it has also guaranteed not to participate in any military bloc and not to allow the establishment of military bases on its territory. This has foiled the conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc to pull Austria into a military aggressive group. At present, the United States and its followers are implementing the Paris Agreements, greatly increasing the threat of a new war in Europe. Therefore, the independence of Austria, located in the center of Europe, is of particular significance. The practitioners of the Western "policy of strength" want to disguise their failure and unease by claiming that the signing of the Austrian State Treaty is the result of the Western countries' ratification of the Paris Agreements. This statement is nothing more than using this as a pretext to promote the "policy of strength." However, everyone can see that the signing of the Austrian State Treaty is a serious blow to the aggressive policy of the United States in preparing for a new war in Europe.
    The signing of the Austrian State Treaty has given Austria a neutral position, thereby enabling it to develop along the path of peace and freedom. Social forces that are determined to take this path have already emerged in Austria. The Austrian Parliament has unanimously expressed its support for adopting a policy of neutrality. Austrian Foreign Minister Figl, who represented Austria in signing the Austrian State Treaty, also said that Austria's declared policy of neutrality "is in line with the wishes of all the Austrian people." This is imaginable because it provides appropriate guarantees for the peaceful life of the Austrian people. People can believe that the Austrian people will cherish their acquired independence and security status, and cherish their peaceful lives. However, Austria's position must also be respected and guaranteed by the countries concerned. The Soviet Union's position in this regard is beyond doubt. Austria was able to achieve this status because of the Soviet Union's efforts. The question is the future attitude of Western countries, especially the United States. Peace-loving people will expect the United States to strictly abide by its international obligations.
    The successful resolution of the Austrian problem shows that other outstanding international issues can also be resolved through peaceful agreements. First of all, the German people can see from this that they have no reason to follow the path arranged for them by the American aggressive bloc. It is very clear that as long as West Germany abandons its policy of following the United States in reviving German militarism and does not participate in the Western military bloc, Germany can achieve a future of peace and independence. The new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet government in the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission advocates that the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France immediately withdraw their occupying forces from German territory. Implementing such a step will obviously be conducive to the Germans themselves reaching an understanding. There is no doubt that after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, the struggle against the revival of West German militarism and for peaceful reunification will be further intensified throughout Germany. The Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world welcome the signing of the Austrian State Treaty with satisfaction and are jubilant for this major victory of the forces of peace. We are even more convinced that as long as the peace-loving countries and people of the world persist in their struggle, the just cause of striving for peace will surely be victorious.

### 欢迎签订对奥和约

　　欢迎签订对奥和约
    爱好和平人民长久盼望着的苏、美、英、法对奥和约签订了。这是目前国际关系中的一件大事。这个和约的签订，不仅使奥地利恢复了自由和独立，而且为和平协商解决其他悬而未决的国际问题开辟了新的途径。它对于加强欧洲安全和世界和平有着重大的意义。
    对奥和约的签订，是维护和平和争取国际合作政策的伟大成就。奥地利问题拖延了十年之久而未获解决，责任是十分清楚的。苏联一贯主张根据保障奥地利民族独立的利益和保障欧洲安全的利益尽快缔结对奥和约，并曾为此进行了不懈的努力。但是美、英、法三国不仅在草拟对奥和约的工作上一味拖延阻挠，而且力图把奥地利拉入西方军事集团，以堵塞解决奥地利问题的道路。只是由于苏联最近采取了一系列积极的步骤，特别是苏奥会谈所取得的协议消除了西方国家在签订对奥和约问题上所制造的困难，才促成了奥地利问题的圆满解决。人们看到，即使在四国驻奥大使会议中，以美国为首的西方集团仍然极力横生枝节。只是由于苏联以坚韧不拔的精神争取协议，由于奥地利人民和欧洲爱好和平人民全力要求解决对奥和约问题，因此，美国和它的伙伴们才不得不同意了签订这个和约。这些事实充分表明了苏联谋求和平和缓和国际紧张局势的诚意。同时这也表明，人民争取和平和独立的决心和力量是不容忽视的。
    由于签订了对奥和约，奥地利恢复了独立，它并且保证不参加任何军事集团，不容许在自己的领土上建立军事基地。这就使美国侵略集团想把奥地利拉进军事侵略集团的阴谋遭受了失败。目前，美国和它的追随者正在把巴黎协定付诸实施，使欧洲的新战争威胁大大加剧。因此，处在欧洲中心的奥地利的独立，就有着特别重大的意义。西方的“实力政策”奉行者为了掩饰他们的失败和不安，竟想把对奥和约的签订说成是由于西方国家批准巴黎协定的结果。这种说法无非是为了借端宣传“实力政策”。但是，谁都看得出，对奥和约的签订，是对美国在欧洲准备新战争的侵略政策的一个严重打击。
    对奥和约的签订，使奥地利得到了中立的地位，从而使它有可能循着和平和自由的道路发展。在奥地利国内已出现了坚决走这条道路的社会力量。奥地利议会曾经一致表示赞成采取中立化的政策。代表奥地利在对奥和约上签字的奥地利外交部长费格尔也说过：奥地利宣布中立的政策“是符合奥地利全体人民的愿望的”。这是可以想像得到的，因为这使奥地利人民的和平生活有了适当的保障。人们可以相信，奥地利人民将会珍惜他们所获得的独立和安全的地位，珍惜他们的和平生活。但是，奥地利的这种地位还必须受到有关各国的尊重和保证。苏联在这方面的立场是无可怀疑的。奥地利能够取得这种地位，就是由于苏联的努力。问题是在于西方国家，尤其是美国今后的态度。爱好和平人民将期待美国严格遵守它的国际义务。
    奥地利问题的圆满解决，表明其他的悬而未决的国际问题也同样有可能通过和平协议来求得解决。首先是德国人民可以由此看到，他们没有理由要走美国侵略集团给他们安排的道路。事情很清楚，只要西德摈弃追随美国复活德国军国主义的政策，不参加西方军事集团，德国就可以获得和平、独立的前途。苏联政府在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出的新裁军建议，主张苏、美、英、法四大国立即从德国领土上撤退它们的占领军。实施这样的步骤显然将有利于德国人自己之间求得谅解。毫无疑问，对奥和约签订之后，反对复活西德军国主义和争取和平统一的斗争将会在整个德国更进一步地高涨起来。中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民都怀着满意的心情欢迎对奥和约的签订，并为和平力量的这一重大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。我们更加坚信：只要世界爱好和平的国家和人民坚持斗争，争取和平的正义事业一定能够获得胜利。
