To the Editor:

The health administrative departments of Sichuan Province are not doing enough in supervising pharmaceutical production and inspecting medicines, which has resulted in frequent incidents of drugs being deemed substandard, leading to cessation of sales, returns, or exchanges. From February to April this year, the Mianyang branch of the China National Pharmaceutical Company in Sichuan Province received nineteen official documents from the Sichuan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company and its Chongqing purchasing and supply station regarding notices to cease sales, return, or exchange drugs (and medical devices). The varieties included anesthetic ether produced by the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory, 50x10 cm distilled water injection, batch number 629 of ephedrine hydrochloride injection from Chengdu Pharmaceutical Factory, batch number 20 of 20-tablet compound aspirin tablets from Huayang Pharmaceutical Factory, and 500 ml batch number 348 of sodium chloride injection from Yaoyou Pharmaceutical Factory, among others. This phenomenon has a significant impact on ensuring the safety of medication for the masses, the health of the people, and reducing commodity circulation costs.

This situation is not unique to Sichuan Province. Among the eleven types of drugs for which cessation of sales, returns, and exchanges were notified to the Mianyang branch from October to December 1954, products from outside the province accounted for three; in the eighteen varieties for which cessation of sales, returns, and exchanges were notified from February to April this year, products from outside the province accounted for eight.

I hope that health administrative departments in various regions will pay attention to this situation and cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen the supervision and inspection of drug production to prevent substandard drugs from being sold on the market.

　  加强药品的检验工作编辑同志：
    四川省卫生行政部门对药品生产的监督和药品的检验工作做得不够深入，以致经常发生由于发现药品不合规格而造成停售、退货或掉换的事件。今年二月到四月，中国医药公司四川省绵阳支公司收到四川省医药公司和该公司重庆采购供应站发来关于通知药品（械）停售、退货、换货的公文达十九件。品种包括西南药厂生产的麻醉乙醚、五○×一○公分蒸馏水注射液，成都药厂六二九批号盐酸麻黄素针、华洋药厂二○片装批号二○号复方阿司匹林片、药友药厂五○○毫升三四八批号氯化钠针等。这种现象对保证群众用药的安全、人民身体健康，以及降低商品流转费用，都有很大的影响。
    这种情况，不仅发生在四川省。在一九五四年十月到十二月，绵阳支公司接到的停售、退货、换货通知中的十一种药品，属于省外的产品就占三种；今年二月到四月通知停售、退货、换货的十八种品种中，省外的产品就有八种。
    我希望各地卫生行政部门对这情况要引起注意，要配合有关部门加强对药品生产的监督、检验工作。防止不合格的药品在市场销售。
