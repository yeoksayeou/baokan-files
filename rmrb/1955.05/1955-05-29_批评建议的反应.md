Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Liu Shenzhi, Director of the Guangzhou Railway Administration of the Ministry of Railways, wrote: After the People's Daily published the critical opinions of the Hunan Provincial Transition Construction Committee on April 3 regarding our bureau's refusal to accept demobilized construction soldiers for work, our bureau sent people to Changde to investigate and handle the matter carefully. According to the review results of our bureau and the CPC Changde Municipal Committee, in addition to the one originally qualified and employed by the Zhuzhou Branch Bureau, there were two more demobilized construction soldiers among the ten not hired who basically met the requirements for our bureau's traffic staff, and it was decided to hire them.

    The Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry wrote: We read the issue raised by Comrade Xu Jin in the People's Daily on March 13 regarding the rational use of technical personnel and felt that this issue is one that we should pay special attention to and resolve appropriately; it is also correct for various design institutions to conduct design according to professional division of labor, and it is the direction of our work. Therefore, in April, when our bureau convened a meeting of the heads of planning sections of various branch bureaus, a comprehensive arrangement was initially made for the design tasks and strengths for the next three years. In order to rationally use technical personnel and gradually move design institutions towards specialization, our bureau has merged the Taiyuan Design Office, which originally undertook the design tasks of three newly built locomotive and rolling stock plants, and the First Design Branch Bureau, which originally undertook the design tasks of two rebuilt locomotive and rolling stock plants, and also made some adjustments to the tasks undertaken by the First Design Branch Bureau and the Second Design Branch Bureau, so that the use of manpower is more economical, and the design progress is more guaranteed.

    The Hunan Provincial Forestry Department wrote: The reader's letter "Hunan Province Urgently Needs to Strengthen Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Work," published on the "Reader's Letters" page on March 27, reflects the situation completely accurately. We sincerely accept the criticism. In order to strengthen forest fire prevention work, the Provincial Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Headquarters and the Provincial Forestry Department have organized inspection teams to inspect forest protection and fire prevention work; some cadres who do not pay attention to forest protection and fire prevention work have been dealt with. Leading organs of various special districts and counties have also studied and arranged for forest protection and fire prevention work. At present, the forest fire situation has decreased, but rural agricultural activities are tense, and many farmers are burning wasteland and ash to accumulate fertilizer. We should vigorously carry out forest protection and fire prevention publicity in conjunction with production to prevent mountain fires.

    The Office of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee wrote: Regarding the error of "missing a word, misdirecting a thousand miles," we have ordered the comrades who should bear the main responsibility to make a self-criticism. In the future, we plan to establish some necessary inspection systems to prevent similar errors from occurring.

    After this newspaper published the critical letter "Why are Cottonseeds Late in Arriving in Liaoyang" on May 1, the Liaoyang County Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company wrote on May 10, expressing its acceptance of the newspaper's criticism and stating that it will strengthen its thinking on serving agricultural production and improve its rural procurement work in the future.

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
    铁道部广州铁路管理局局长刘慎之来信：四月三日人民日报刊载湖南省转业建设委员会反映我局拒绝吸收转业建设军人参加工作的批评意见以后，我局就派人到常德调查并作了慎重处理。根据我局和中共常德市委复查研究结果，除原审查合格已由株州分局录用的一名外，在未录取的十名转业建设军人中，还有二人基本上合乎我局行车工作人员条件，决定予以录用。
    第一机械工业部设计总局来信：我们在三月十三日人民日报上看到徐进同志所提出的合理地使用技术力量的问题，感到这个问题是我们应特别重视并加以适当解决的；各设计机构按专业分工进行设计也是正确的，是我们工作的方向。因此，四月份我局召开各分局计划科长会议时，对今后三年的设计任务和力量，初步作了通盘的安排。为了合理地使用技术力量，使设计机构逐步走入专业化，我局已将原承担三个新建机车车辆厂设计任务的太原设计处和原承担两个改建机车车辆厂设计任务的第一设计分局合并，而且又把第一设计分局所承担的任务和第二设计分局作了些调整，这样人力的使用上比较节省，同时设计进度也较有保证。
    湖南省林业厅来信：三月二十七日“读者来信专页”所刊“湖南省急需加强护林防火工作”的读者来信，反映的情况是完全正确的。我们诚恳接受批评。为了加强山林防火工作，省护林防火指挥部和省林业厅已组织检查组检查护林防火工作；对一些不重视护林防火工作的干部已作了处理。各专区、县领导机关，也对护林防火工作作了研究和安排。目前森林火灾情况已经减少，但农村农事活动正紧张，烧荒烧灰积肥的农民很多，我们当结合生产大力开展护林防火宣传，防止山火发生。
    中共湖南省委宣传部办公室来信：关于“漏掉一字，错转千里”的错误，我们已责成应负主要责任的同志作出了检讨。今后准备建立一些必要的检查制度，以防止类似错误的发生。
    五月一日本报发表了“为什么棉籽迟迟发不到辽阳”的批评信以后，辽阳县花纱布公司于五月十日来信表示接受报纸的批评，并表示今后要加强为农业生产服务的思想，改进农村采购工作。
