    Let "Key" Cooperatives be Liberated from Heavy Burdens
　　Ji Xichen
    Continuously providing economic and technical assistance to agricultural producer cooperatives is an important condition for promoting their consolidation and development. However, some departments, under the guise of "helping key" units, engage in acts that benefit themselves at the expense of others.
    In the spring of 1954, the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Santai County, Sichuan Province, signed a "cooperation contract" with the Fourteenth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative; the contract stipulated that the Supply and Marketing Cooperative should supply the agricultural cooperative with rapeseed cake fertilizer. However, what the Supply and Marketing Cooperative "supplied" to the agricultural cooperative was 20,000 jin of moldy cottonseed cake that they couldn't sell. When the agricultural cooperative's cadres didn't want it, the person in charge of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative repeatedly "did ideological work" on them, saying, "Our three major cooperatives should support each other and overcome difficulties. Although the cottonseed cake is bad, it's state property. If you, the 'key cooperative,' don't want it, who should? Who will be responsible if we accumulate capital?" Later, the cooperative cadres, under the "persuasion" that "key cooperatives should take the lead and set an example," finally accepted the bad cottonseed cake. After being applied to the rice paddies, some of it remained as hard lumps even after a year. This item alone cost the agricultural cooperative 700 yuan.
    During the autumn harvest, technical departments came to the "key" cooperative to promote threshing machines. However, all three threshing machines promoted were only good for display, not for use. The cadres responsible for promoting the new agricultural implements didn't care about this at all and left after urging the agricultural cooperative to pay. The threshing machines were then "locked up" by the agricultural cooperative. Later, it was learned that these bad threshing machines were sent to the "key" cooperative because they were difficult to sell elsewhere. The technical departments even said that this was a successful experience of "driving the general through the key."
    Regardless of the actual situation, bringing everything to the "key" units for "demonstration" also increased the burden on key cooperatives. The Zunsheng Agricultural Cooperative planted 10,000 mulberry trees to develop sericulture. The cooperative members were already skilled in raising silkworms and using new grafting methods, but the local silk company, ignoring the opposition of the masses, insisted on sending four novices who had just learned new techniques to the "key" cooperative to do technical "demonstrations" of new grafting methods. They didn't graft any better than the agricultural cooperative members, but the agricultural cooperative had to pay them 1.5 yuan each day. The agricultural cooperative already had scissors for pruning mulberry branches, but the local silk company sent seven pairs, insisting that they buy them. The cooperative director, Wang Da'an, returned them several times, but the company sent them back each time, using the big stick of "cooperatives must obey national production plans and cherish national industrial products" to pressure the agricultural cooperative. Although their inventory was sold, the agricultural cooperative's limited working capital was tied up.
    Similar erroneous practices in treating key work areas have also been discovered elsewhere. Many key cooperatives also have burdens such as too many meetings, too many visits, and too much reception work. Under these circumstances, despite the large number of cadres, loans, and state investment in "key" cooperatives, the work and production of "key" cooperatives have still been damaged. In order to better leverage the role of key work, it is necessary to improve the leadership of key work, reduce the extra burden on "key" cooperatives; and matters such as forcing agricultural cooperatives to buy things should be seriously dealt with as acts of violation of law and discipline.

    让“重点”社从重担下解放出来
　　纪希晨
    不断地在经济上和技术上给农业生产合作社以帮助，是促进农业生产合作社巩固发展的重要条件。但是，有些部门却在“帮助重点”的美名下，作出损人利己的行为。
    一九五四年春天，四川省三台县尊胜农业生产合作社同十四区供销社订立了“结合合同”；合同规定供销社应以菜油枯供应农业社。但是，供销社“供应”给农业社的，却是两万斤霉烂了的推销不出的棉籽枯。农业社的干部不愿要，供销社负责人就三番五次地“打通思想”，他说：“我们三大合作，应该相互支援克服困难。棉籽枯虽然坏了，可是这是国家财产，你们‘重点社’都不要，该叫谁要？如果我们积压了资金，谁能负责？”后来社干部终于在“重点社应当带头，应当起模范作用”的“说服”之下，收下了坏棉籽枯。这些棉籽枯上到稻田里，有的在一年之后还是硬块块。只这一项，农业社就损失了七百元。
    秋收时，技术部门到“重点”社来推广打谷机。可是，推广的三部打谷机都只能看，不能用。负责推广新农具的干部根本不管这些，催着农业社交款就走了。打谷机于是被农业社“禁闭”起来。后来才知道，这些坏打谷机是因为在别处不好推销，所以才给“重点”社送了来的。技术部门还说这是“通过重点，带动一般”的成功经验。
    不看实际情况，无论什么都到“重点”里来“示范”，也给重点社增加了许多负担。尊胜农业社为了发展养蚕业，栽了一万株桑树。社员们本来会养蚕，也会用新法接桑，但当地蚕丝公司却不顾群众反对，硬派了四个刚学习过的新手，来到“重点”做新法接桑的技术“示范”。他们接的并不比农业社社员接的好，可是，每天却要农业社给他们出一元五角的工钱。农业社已有剪接桑枝的剪刀，但当地蚕丝公司却送来七把，硬要他们购买。社长王达安几次退回去，公司几次给送来，并且用“合作社要服从国家计划生产，要爱护国家工业品”的大帽子来压农业社。他们的存货虽然推销了，可是农业社有限的流动资金却被积压了起来。
    类似这样的对待工作重点的错误做法，在其他地方也有发现。许多重点社还有会议多、参观多、送往迎来多等等负担。在这种情况下，尽管用在“重点”社的干部多，贷款多，国家投资多，“重点”社的工作和生产依然受到了损害。为了更好地发挥工作重点的作用，必须改善对工作重点的领导，减少“重点”社的额外负担；对于强迫农业社买东西的事情，应当作为违法乱纪的行为严肃地加以处理。
