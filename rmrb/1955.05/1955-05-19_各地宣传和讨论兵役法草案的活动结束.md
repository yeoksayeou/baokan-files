Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The activities of propaganda and discussion on the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft) have concluded throughout the country.

　　Since the State Council promulgated the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft) on February 15th this year, and notified the local people's committees at all levels to immediately conduct discussions and solicit the opinions of the people, the people's committees at all levels and the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have held meetings for discussions, and organized representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations for forums. The people's committees at all levels publicized the Draft Military Service Law (Revised Draft) to the broad masses of people through newspapers, radio stations, and by sending out propagandists and reporters, and invited cadres and combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army to give reports. In many cities, factories, and rural areas, wired broadcasts, slides, blackboard newspapers, and dramas were also used for publicity. According to statistics, by April 26th, more than 80 percent of the people in Fujian Province had heard the propaganda about the Draft Military Service Law (Revised Draft), basically achieving universal knowledge.

　　The people's committees at all levels and the broad masses of people warmly support the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft). The people of Minhou County, Fujian Province, compiled a快板 (clapper talk) entitled "Seven Good Things About the Compulsory Military Service System" based on the spirit of the Draft Military Service Law (Revised Draft), which is spreading everywhere. Gao Wanqi, a farmer from Fengtai District, Beijing, said: "We farmers also have the opportunity to join the People's Liberation Army, and in the future, we will be able to both write and fight, and build and defend the motherland. I truly support it from the bottom of my heart." Many young people in factories, rural areas, and universities have intensified their physical training in preparation for enlisting in the military in the future.

　　In the process of discussing the Draft Military Service Law (Revised Draft), the people's committees and the people at all levels also put forward some suggestions for revision. At present, these opinions are being centrally compiled by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, and reported to the State Council.

　　各地宣传和讨论兵役法草案的活动结束
    新华社十八日讯　全国各地宣传和讨论中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）的活动已经结束。
    自从今年二月十五日国务院公布了中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案），并通知地方各级人民委员会应即进行讨论和征求人民的意见以后，各地人民委员会和中国人民政协地方委员会都开会进行了讨论，并组织各民主党派、各人民团体的代表进行了座谈。各地人民委员会通过报纸、广播电台和派出宣传员、报告员，向广大人民宣传了兵役法（修正草案），并邀请人民解放军的干部和战斗英雄作了报告。许多城市、工厂和农村在宣传中，还采用有线广播、幻灯、黑板报和话剧等形式进行宣传。据统计，福建省截至四月二十六日止，全省百分之八十以上的人民都听到了关于兵役法（修正草案）的宣传，基本上达到了家喻户晓。
    各地人民委员会和广大人民热烈拥护中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）。福建省闽侯县人民根据兵役法（修正草案）的精神编成了“义务兵役制七好”的快板，到处传颂。北京市丰台区农民高万起说：“我们农民也有机会参加人民解放军，将来能文能武，建设和保卫祖国全都行。我真是从心眼里赞成。”许多工厂、农村和高等学校的青年都更加紧锻炼身体，准备今后应征服兵役。
    在讨论兵役法（修正草案）的过程中，各地人民委员会和人民群众也提出了若干修正意见。目前，这些意见正由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会负责集中整理，报送国务院。
