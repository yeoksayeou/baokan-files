Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th. According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: Li Xiangchao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, in a letter to Parks, the Senior Member of the US side on the 16th, exposed the fabricated claims in Parks' letter of the 13th with irrefutable facts—Parks insisted that the US military aircraft's intrusion into the airspace of the People's Republic of China on May 10th was an attack by Korean-Chinese aircraft on US aircraft in "international waters."

Li Xiangchao pointed out: The incident on May 10th was a result of your military aircraft intruding into the airspace over the territory of the People's Republic of China. This incident is completely unrelated to the Korean Armistice Agreement and therefore does not fall under the nature of matters to be handled within the Korean Military Armistice Commission.

Li Xiangchao said: However, you are distorting the facts, slandering our side, and insisting that our side has not complied with the Armistice Agreement after the ceasefire. This is clearly your attempt to cover up your own criminal behavior, while creating an excuse for your attempt to openly undermine the Armistice Agreement.

Li Xiangchao went on to accuse the US side of not only failing to stop its criminal, provocative, and hostile actions, but also threatening the Korean-Chinese side under the guise of "international waters" or "self-defense," and threatening to continue such actions. Li Xiangchao warned the US side that if US military aircraft, disregarding the warnings of the Korean-Chinese side, intrude into the airspace over the territory of the Korean-Chinese side under the pretext of "international waters" or "self-defense," the Korean-Chinese side, for the sake of self-defense, will take resolute measures at any time, and the US side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　李相朝中将写信给美方首席委员
　　斥美方抵赖美机侵犯中国领空的罪行
    新华社平壤十七日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在十六日给美方首席委员帕克斯一封信，用无可反驳的事实揭露帕克斯十三日来信中的捏造说法——帕克斯在信中把美方军用飞机在五月十日侵入中华人民共和国领空的事件硬说成是朝中方面飞机在
  “公海”上空攻击了美方飞机。
    李相朝中将指出：五月十日的事件是你方军用飞机侵入中华人民共和国领土上空的结果。这一事件与朝鲜停战协定完全无关，因此并不具有在朝鲜军事停战委员会中处理的性质。
    李相朝中将说：但是，你方却歪曲事实，诽谤我方，硬说我方在停战后没有遵守停战协定，这显然是你方企图掩饰你方自己的这种罪恶行为，同时替你方力图公开破坏停战协定制造借口。
    李相朝中将接着指责美方非但没有停止罪恶的、挑衅的和敌对的行为，反而假“公海”或“自卫”之名，扬言要继续这种行为，企图威胁朝中方面。李相朝中将对美方提出警告说，如果美方军用飞机不顾朝中方面的警告，在“公海”或“自卫”的借口下侵入朝中方面的领土上空，朝中方面为了自卫起见，将随时采取坚决的措施，美方必须对由此产生的一切后果负担全部责任。
