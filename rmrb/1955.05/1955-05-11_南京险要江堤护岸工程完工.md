The river embankment protection project at the critical sections of the Yangtze River in Pukou and Xiaguan, Nanjing, has been successfully completed. Following the devastating floods of last year, collapses occurred on the riverbanks of Pukou and Xiaguan, seriously affecting the safety of the railway ferry dock, as well as the wharves and important buildings on both sides. Based on the recommendations of Soviet experts, the State Council decided to sink wooden rafts at the bottom of the river below the average low water level and build slope protection above the low water level. After the completion of the project, the riverbank will be stable for a considerable period. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, the project quality basically met the design requirements, and a large number of cadres and workers were trained in the construction process, creating experience for future submerged raft revetment projects in major rivers.

During the six months of construction, manpower and materials were received from various regions. More than fifty units in Wuhan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and other places sent technical personnel and workers. Stone workers from Xuzhou, Chuxian, and Nanjing delivered more than 400,000 tons of stones. Farmers from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu supplied more than 59 million catties of willow branches, which strongly supported the smooth progress of the project.

　　南京险要江堤护岸工程完工
    南京市浦口、下关两处江堤险要地段的沉排护岸工程，已胜利完成。去年特大洪水后，浦口、下关江岸发生坍塌现象，严重影响铁路轮渡栈桥及两岸码头、重要建筑物的安全。国务院根据苏联专家的建议，决定在平均低水位以下的江底沉放木排，在低水位以上砌坡护岸，工程完成后，可在相当长的时期内使江岸稳固。由于苏联专家的指导和帮助，使工程质量基本上达到设计的要求，并在施工中训练了大批干部和工人，为今后在大江河流中进行沉排护岸工程创造了经验。
    在半年的施工过程中，得到了各地人力物力的支援。武汉、上海、天津、南京等地五十多个单位派来了技术人员和工人，徐州、滁县、南京的采石工人送来四十多万吨石块，浙江、安徽、江苏的农民供给了五千九百多万斤柳条，这些都有力地支援了工程的顺利进行。
