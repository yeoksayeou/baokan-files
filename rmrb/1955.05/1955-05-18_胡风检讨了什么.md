What Did Hu Feng Confess?
    Fang Zixing
    I am a worker at the Beijing Green Treasure Fountain Pen Factory. When I first saw the title of Mr. Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th, I thought Hu Feng seemed to have realized his mistakes. However, after carefully reading his self-criticism together with Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on the same day, the above feeling immediately disappeared. It turned out that Hu Feng was just changing his tactics!
    In Hu Feng's more than 10,000-word confession, what exactly was he criticizing? It can be summarized in one sentence: Hu Feng, with his "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and stance," had only a lack of understanding of Marxism for more than twenty years, only overemphasized his own "revolutionary nature," and did not confront the literary movement led by the Party, let alone oppose the Party and Marxism.
    In fact, is Hu Feng's literary and ideological problem really as he examines it? No, it is not. We only need to look at the summary of the thirty-four private letters Hu Feng wrote to Shu Wu from 1943 to 1950 provided by Shu Wu to fully see that Hu Feng has not only consistently resisted the literary movement led by the Party, but also consistently viciously slandered and opposed the Party and Marxism. In his letters to Shu Wu, Hu Feng even referred to the responsible comrades of the Party leading literature and art as "officials," "masters," and "dignitaries," and called the Party organization the "officialdom." How can this be considered revolutionary? Hu Feng regarded some progressive literary and art figures as "maggots." Is this the "revolutionary humanistic spirit" of Hu Feng who is "inclined to revolution"? Hu Feng even explicitly stated to Shu Wu: "We want to shake the ruling forces of twenty years of mechanism, and it is necessary to spend a little more effort." Look! Hu Feng is willing to sacrifice everything to oppose the Party and Marxism, and his will is so firm!
    The materials provided by Shu Wu this time are ironclad evidence and a powerful demon-revealing mirror. No matter how capable Hu Feng is, he cannot cover up the fact that he has consistently opposed the Party and Marxism.
    Today, our Party organization is as solid as a rock, and its prestige among the people far exceeds any period since its birth. Our literary and art ranks are also purer and more united than before; the level of awareness of the people across the country has also generally improved, and their desire to learn and master Marxism is growing. Under such circumstances, any of Hu Feng's tricks cannot deceive our Party, literary and art circles, and the people of the whole country. If Hu Feng truly wants to change his anti-Party stance, then he must make a truthful and profound self-criticism. To cure a long-standing poisonous sore, it is of course impossible not to feel pain; but this is much better than letting it fester and suppurate, leading to one's own destruction in the end.

　  胡风检讨了什么
    方孜行
    我是北京绿宝金笔厂的职工。五月十三日的
  “人民日报”发表了胡风先生的“我的自我批判”。我乍一看这篇检讨文章的标题，以为胡风对自己的错误好像有了认识了。然而，当我将他的自我批判和“人民日报”同日发表的舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”一起仔细地看了以后，上述的那种感觉随即消灭了。原来胡风只不过是变换一下手法而已！
    在胡风的一万多字的检讨文章里，究竟批判了些什么东西呢？可以用这样一句话概括它的含意：具有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的胡风，二十多年来只不过是对马克思主义理解不够，只不过是过分重视了自己的“革命性”，而没有对抗党所领导的文艺运动，更谈不上反对党和马克思主义。
    事实上，胡风的文艺思想问题，是不是就像他所检查的那样呢？不是的。我们只要从舒芜提供出来的胡风在一九四三年——一九五○年写给他的三十四封私人信件的摘要中，就完全可以看出胡风不仅一贯地反抗党所领导的文艺运动，而且一贯毒恶地诬蔑和反对党和马克思主义。胡风在给舒芜的信件中，竟称党领导文艺的负责同志们为“官们”、
  “老爷们”、“权贵”，称党的组织为“官方”，这还谈得上有什么革命性？胡风将一些进步文艺界的人们看作是“蛆虫”，这难道就是“倾向于革命”的胡风的“革命的人道主义精神”吗？胡风更对舒芜明确表示：“我们是要动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力，多花一点力气是必要的。”看！胡风能够为了反对党和马克思主义而不惜牺牲一切，他的意志是如此坚决！
    舒芜这次提供出来的材料，是铁的证据，是一面强有力的照妖镜。胡风有天大的本事，也掩盖不了他一贯反党反马克思主义的事实。
    今天，我们党的组织巩固得已和磐石一样，它在人民群众中的威信，远远超过了从它诞生以来的任何一个时期；我们的文艺队伍也比以前更加纯洁和团结；全国人民的觉悟程度也普遍有了提高，他们要求学习和掌握马克思主义的愿望日益高涨。在这种情况下，胡风的任何狡计是哄骗不了我们的党、文艺界和全国人民的。胡风如果真正愿意改变自己的反党立场，那末必须作真实的、深刻的检讨。要想根治好年代已久的毒疮，当然不可能不痛；但这要比任其腐烂、化脓，以致最后毁灭自己强得多。
