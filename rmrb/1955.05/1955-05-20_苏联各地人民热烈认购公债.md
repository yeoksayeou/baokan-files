People Throughout the Soviet Union Enthusiastically Subscribe to Government Bonds

The working people of the Soviet Union enthusiastically support the issuance of the 1955 national bonds and are actively subscribing.

Meetings have been held in factories and organizations in Moscow to subscribe to the bonds. Gireyev, an old worker at the Ilyich factory, said at a bond subscription meeting: In 1927, I subscribed to the first national industrialization bonds in the factory. At that time, we did not have such workshops and such excellent equipment. The state has repaid us a hundredfold for the bonds we purchased. Bright workshops, new machine equipment, new residences, and cultural welfare institutions—all of this is what we have received from the state.

All the workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory have subscribed to the bonds.

In Kiev, subscriptions have been made at the Red Excavator Factory, the Gorky Machine Tool Factory, the National Shevchenko University, and the Ukrainian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Meetings have also been held at the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. Engineer Kiselev said at a meeting that we know where our bonds will be used. Along the Volga River, the outline of the Kuibyshev hydraulic engineering complex is becoming clearer and clearer. It will start generating electricity this year.

In the reclaimed areas, people who are busy with spring plowing and sowing are also actively subscribing to government bonds.

　  苏联各地人民热烈认购公债
    苏联各地劳动人民热烈拥护发行一九五五年国家公债，并积极认购。
    莫斯科各工厂、机关纷纷举行集会，认购公债。伊里奇工厂的老工人吉里耶夫在认购公债的集会上说：一九二七年，我在工厂里认购了第一次国家工业化的公债，那时，我们还没有这样的车间和这样优良的设备。我们购买的公债，国家已经百倍地偿还了我们。明亮的车间、新式的机器设备、新的住宅和文化福利机关——所有这一切都是我们从国家得到的。
    斯大林汽车工厂的全体工人都认购了公债。
    在基辅，红色掘凿机工厂、高尔基工作母机工厂、国立谢夫钦科大学、乌克兰农业科学院都进行了认购。
    在古比雪夫水电站工地上也举行了集会。工程师基谢列夫在一个集会上说，我们知道我们的公债将用在什么地方。在伏尔加河沿岸，古比雪夫水力综合工程枢纽的轮廓越来越清楚了，它在今年内就要开始发电。
    在开垦地区，正在紧张地进行春耕播种的人们也纷纷认购了公债。
