Several Forms of State Capitalist Commerce
　　Sūn Zhòngdá

    I.

    China's capitalist commerce, within a certain period, played a positive role in connecting urban and rural material exchanges, expanding commodity circulation, and supplying the needs of residents. However, it also has negative aspects. If its speculative and destructive nature is not restricted, it will hinder the state's planned production and distribution of goods, disrupt the state's market management, and increase the burden on consumers. Therefore, the state must adopt a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation toward capitalist commerce, and encourage and guide them to transform into various forms of state capitalism in order to gradually realize their socialist transformation.

    State capitalist commerce is an economy in our country's transition period that is related to and cooperates with capitalist economy to varying degrees. It is a concrete and effective form of the state's leadership and management of capitalist commerce and the supervision of it by the working masses. Guiding and incorporating capitalist commerce into various forms of state capitalism is conducive to the state's enterprise transformation and human transformation of them, conducive to the state's planned and organized guidance of production and distribution, and to calmly and properly transforming capitalist commerce into socialist commerce in the end; and to carry out socialist transformation of commercial capitalists and capitalist agents.

    Various forms of state capitalist commerce had some sprouts in the early days of liberation. With the restoration of the national economy and the start of planned construction, the growth rate of people's purchasing power exceeded the growth rate of certain consumer goods production. Shortages of certain major commodities such as grain, edible oil, and cotton cloth occurred. Due to the speculative and destructive nature of capitalist commerce, the contradiction between the supply and demand of these commodities was further deepened. In order to ensure the needs of the people, stabilize market prices, and eliminate speculation, the state expanded processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales for capitalist industry, and implemented planned purchase and planned supply of grain, edible oil, and cotton cloth, transforming the free market for these commodities into an organized and planned market. At the same time, with state-owned commercial enterprises controlling the source of goods and strengthening wholesale business, some capitalist wholesalers have been gradually replaced, some operate as commissioned or sub-commissioned businesses for state-owned commercial enterprises, some continue to maintain their original status, and some capitalist retailers in some industries have turned to operating as distributors or consignment agents for state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises, thus promoting the development of state capitalist commerce.

　  II.

　　Due to the different business operations and management conditions of capitalist commerce, the complexity of commodity types, and the inconsistency of state control over sources of goods, state capitalist commerce has a variety of forms, among which distribution and consignment are the main forms. If we distinguish based on existing forms, it can be roughly summarized into the following three categories:

    I. Distribution: State-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises entrust capitalist retailers to distribute goods that the state has fully or mostly controlled. The distribution store purchases goods at wholesale prices in cash, and sells distribution goods according to the state's sales plan, state-owned commercial retail price, and other stipulated conditions, obtaining the wholesale-retail price difference. The distribution store no longer purchases distribution goods from the free market.

    Wholesale Purchase and Retail Sale: This form belongs to the same type as distribution, referred to as wholesale-retail. Capitalist retailers purchase goods from state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises at wholesale prices in cash, and retail them to consumers. The commodities of wholesale purchase and retail sale are usually some relatively minor commodities, so in terms of price, in addition to selling according to the state-owned commercial price, they can also be sold according to the approved price. In terms of purchasing, if the wholesale purchase and retail sale store obtains permission from state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises for this type of commodity, it can purchase some from the free market.

    Commissioned Wholesale: State-owned commercial enterprises entrust capitalist wholesalers to wholesale goods that the state has fully or mostly controlled to private retailers. The commissioned wholesale store purchases goods from state-owned commercial enterprises in cash, wholesales commissioned wholesale goods according to the conditions stipulated by state-owned commercial enterprises, and obtains the price difference.

    II. Consignment: State-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises entrust capitalist retailers to sell goods from the state or cooperatives on consignment, giving them a handling fee. The consignment store pays a certain deposit and sells consignment goods according to the state's sales plan, the retail price of state-owned commercial enterprises, and other stipulated conditions. The consignment store no longer purchases consignment goods from the free market.

    The state-owned commercial enterprises entrust capitalist import and export merchants to sell national goods in the capitalist market on consignment according to stipulated conditions, giving them a handling fee, which is also a form of consignment.

    Commissioned Wholesale: State-owned commercial enterprises entrust capitalist wholesalers to wholesale national goods to private retailers on consignment, giving them a handling fee. The consignment wholesale store pays a certain deposit and wholesales consignment wholesale goods according to the conditions stipulated by state-owned commercial enterprises. For those with a large turnover, state-owned commercial enterprises may send full-time cadres to conduct leadership and supervision regularly.

    Commissioned Purchase: State-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises designate varieties, specifications, quantities, and ordering or purchasing prices, and entrust capitalist commercial enterprises to order imported goods in the foreign capitalist market or purchase agricultural products in the domestic market on consignment, and give them a handling fee.

    III. Joint State-Private Ownership: According to state needs, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the capitalists' willingness, the state invests and sends cadres to implement joint operation with capitalists.

    Joint State-Private Operation: State-owned companies organize a group of capitalist import and export merchants according to needs and possibilities, and implement joint state-private operation for a certain or several import and export businesses, that is, joint state-private purchase and sales in the field of import and export trade in the capitalist market.

    Joint State-Private Purchase: According to the needs of both state and private parties, state-owned companies organize capitalist commercial enterprises, stipulate the ratio of state-private funds, purchase plans, and purchase areas, and under the direct leadership of state-owned companies or cooperatives, the state and private parties jointly go to the place of production to purchase; the purchased commodities are jointly sold or distributed according to the state-owned company's price (it can also take the form of state-led private purchase, where the state does not participate in funding, although this form has no economic connection, it still plays a certain role in urban and rural material exchanges).

　  III

　　The capitalist retail commercial sector has a large number of employees. In the future, for a relatively long period of time, under the leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises, it will still play a certain role in expanding social commodity circulation and supplying residents' needs. Therefore, the main target of incorporating them into the state capitalist system is capitalist retailers.

    The following advantages are associated with the full implementation of the distribution system for capitalist retail businesses:

    I. State capitalist commerce, which fully implements the distribution of all commodities, has greatly restricted its original capitalist blind operation and speculative activities. At the same time, the enterprise's source of goods and sales plan are completely subject to state planning. It is used by the state to assist state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises to expand commodity circulation and complete the state supply plan.

    II. Although the wholesale-retail price difference obtained by the capitalists includes a part of the profit, since the entire business is distributed by state-owned companies and sold at the price of state-owned companies, the capitalist exploitation is greatly restricted.

    III. Through the distribution form, the direct relationship between leadership and being led is specifically fixed, making state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises strengthen their leading position over capitalist enterprises. The labor of employees is no longer completely used by capitalists to pursue profits, but mainly serves to complete the state sales plan and supply residents' needs. Following the strengthening of the leadership of socialist commerce and the exertion of the supervisory role of employees, its original capitalist management and operating style can also be gradually improved.

    IV. Incorporating enterprises into the state capitalist system is not only conducive to utilizing, restricting, and transforming the original enterprises, but also enables the original commercial employees to continue to be employed, which can not only avoid the difficulty for the state to re-arrange work for them, but also transform capitalists and capitalist agents while maintaining their livelihoods.

      Wholesale Purchase and Retail Sale is a primary form of state capitalist commerce. The advantage of this form is that it is easy to incorporate capitalist retailers into the state capitalist system because the conditions are relatively broad. The disadvantage is that the state has a relatively loose control over them, and transformation is more difficult. Therefore, when conditions are met, it is necessary to gradually guide and encourage them to switch to distribution or consignment.

    The advantages of Commissioned Wholesale are roughly the same as those of distribution.

    State capitalist commerce, which fully implements the consignment of all commodities, has the above advantages of the distribution form. In addition, although the capitalist private ownership still exists, it has changed. The vast majority of the capitalist's capital is turned into a deposit and exists in the state bank or is paid to the state-owned commercial enterprise or cooperative commercial enterprise. The capitalist can no longer use this part of the capital to engage in capitalist blind operation and speculation. At the same time, the position of employees in the enterprise has also changed to a certain extent. Not only will the supervisory role of employees in the consignment store be gradually strengthened, but they will also be subject to the frequent and widespread supervision of consumers. Because state capitalist consignment stores have the above advantages, after a long period of enterprise transformation and human transformation, it will be conducive to transforming the consignment store into a socialist sales organization and changing the capitalist and capitalist agent into socialist commercial workers. Therefore, consignment is superior to distribution.

    The advantages of Commissioned Wholesale are roughly the same as those of consignment. Domestic market agricultural product consignment purchases are seasonal, and have less impact on enterprise and capitalist transformation.

    As for which form to adopt in specific application, it depends on the needs and possibilities of the local state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises, combined with the different operating conditions of capitalist commercial enterprises there.

    The above advantages of distribution and consignment must be gradually realized through a lot of political and economic work.

    Although joint state-private ownership is an advanced form, since capitalist commercial enterprises are small, widespread, and scattered, and the growth of social purchasing power is limited, the increase in turnover after the implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist commercial enterprises will affect the majority of stores in the same industry and increase the difficulty for the state to make full arrangements for private commercial enterprises. Therefore, the joint state-private ownership form is not suitable as a development direction for the arrangement and transformation of capitalist commercial enterprises. It should only be adopted individually for commercial enterprises that also have processing and manufacturing or have a lot of technical expertise, and at the same time, it must be combined with the arrangement and transformation of the same industry.

    The forms of joint state-private operation in the field of import and export trade in the capitalist market and joint state-private purchase of agricultural and sideline products can be adopted according to specific circumstances at present.

      IV

    The socialist transformation of capitalist commercial enterprises by the state is generally carried out industry by industry, because the organization and planning of the market require distinguishing different commodities and conducting them by industry. At the same time, only by arranging them industry by industry can commercial employees continue to have the opportunity to obtain employment and transformation, and can also give full play to their business experience, which is conducive to expanding commodity circulation.

    The transformation industry by industry includes small merchants and peddlers in this industry. They can also adopt forms such as distribution, consignment, wholesale purchase and retail sale, and consignment purchase. Although these forms seem to be the same as the state capitalist distribution, consignment, wholesale purchase and retail sale, and consignment purchase, since small merchants and peddlers generally have no or only a small amount of capital, open small-scale stores or shoulder-carry hawking and set up stalls for sale, do not hire shop assistants or only hire individual shop assistants, and take their own labor in commodity circulation as the entire or main source of their livelihood, they are working people. Therefore, the nature of these forms adopted for them does not belong to the category of state capitalism.

    The socialist transformation of capitalist commercial enterprises is a special form of class struggle in the transition period. After the state incorporates capitalist commercial enterprises into various forms of state capitalism industry by industry, although it is more conducive to the state's utilization, restriction, and transformation of them, this is only the beginning of the transformation work, and it must not be considered that the transformation work has been completed. Facts have proved that after many capitalist commercial enterprises implemented distribution and consignment, they were unable to maintain these enterprises due to poor management and large expenses. Many capitalists and small business owners still have illegal activities such as adulterating, short weighing, raising prices and refusing to sell, lowering prices and competing for sales, and even stealing materials from state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises, and misappropriating state funds. Therefore, it is necessary to combine enterprise transformation with human transformation. That is to say, on the one hand, we must gradually adapt them to the needs of socialist commerce through enterprise reform; on the other hand, we must transform capitalists and capitalist agents, so that they can play a positive and beneficial role in the socialist transformation as much as possible. However, how to lead and supervise them to improve business management, change their business style, reduce expenses step by step, how to adjust the commercial network under possible conditions, how to supervise and educate these commercial capitalists and capitalist agents, how to stop their illegal activities, and systematically carry out ideological transformation and business training, is a long-term, arduous and complex work. This requires the administrative departments in charge of transforming capitalist commercial enterprises and the relevant state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperative commercial enterprises to strengthen their management and leadership, actively mobilize and rely on employees and consumers to supervise them, and strengthen the education of commercial capitalists on patriotism and law-abiding and accepting socialist transformation through the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade union organizations. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the great historical task of transforming capitalist enterprises and bourgeois elements will be completed in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　国家资本主义商业的几种形式
　　孙仲达
　　一
    我国的资本主义商业，在一定时期内，对于沟通城乡物资交流、扩大商品流转、供应居民需要有着积极的作用；但它也有消极的方面，它的投机性和破坏性如不加以限制，将阻碍国家对商品的有计划地生产和分配，破坏国家对市场的管理，增加消费者的负担。因此，国家对资本主义商业必须采取利用、限制和改造的政策，并鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义以便逐步地实现对它们的社会主义改造。
    国家资本主义商业是我国过渡时期社会主义经济同资本主义经济在不同程度上的联系和合作的经济，是国家对资本主义商业实行领导、管理和工人群众对它实行监督的具体而有效的形式。把资本主义商业引导、纳入各种形式的国家资本主义轨道后，是有利于国家对它们进行企业改造和人的改造，有利于国家有计划有组织地来指导生产和分配，并为从容地和妥善地最后变资本主义商业为社会主义商业；对商业资本家和资本家代理人进行社会主义改造。
    国家资本主义商业的各种形式，解放初期曾有过一些萌芽出现。随着国民经济的恢复和有计划建设的开始，人民购买力的增长速度超过某些消费品生产增长的速度，某些主要商品如粮食、食油、棉布等发生了供不应求的情况，由于资本主义商业的投机性和破坏性，就更加加深了这些商品供求之间的矛盾；国家为了保证人民的需要，稳定市场物价，消灭投机，对资本主义工业扩大了加工、订货、统购、包销，并对粮食、食油、棉布实行计划收购和计划供应，使这些商品的自由市场改变为有组织有计划的市场；同时在国营商业控制货源加强批发业务的情况下，资本主义批发商有的已在逐步被代替，有的为国营商业经营经批、代批业务，有的继续维持，部分行业的资本主义零售商则转为国营商业和合作社商业经营经销、代销等业务，从而使国家资本主义商业也得到了发展。
　  二
　　由于资本主义商业中经营业务和经营情况不同，商品种类复杂和国家对货源控制不一等情况，国家资本主义商业有着多种多样的形式，其中经销和代销是主要的形式。如果就现有形式加以区分，大体上可归纳为下列三类：
    一、经销：国营商业或合作社商业以国家已全部或大部掌握的商品，委托资本主义零售商经销。经销店以现款按批发价进货，并按国家的销售计划、国营商业零售牌价和其他规定条件出售经销商品，获得批零差价。经销店对经销商品不再向自由市场进货。
      批购零销：这一形式和经销属于同一类型，简称批销。资本主义零售商以现款向国营商业或合作社商业按批发价进货，对消费者零销。批购零销的商品，通常是一些比较次要的商品，因而在价格上按照国营商业的牌价出售外，亦可按照核定的价格出售。在进货上，批购零销店对此类商品如果取得国营商业或合作社商业的允许，可向自由市场进货
  一部分。
    经批：国营商业以国家已全部或大部掌握的商品，委托资本主义批发商对私营零售商经批。经批店以现款向国营商业进货，按照国营商业规定条件批售经批商品，并获得差价。
    二、代销：国营商业或合作社商业以国家或合作社的商品，委托资本主义零售商代销，给以手续费。代销店缴存一定的保证金，并按照国家的销售计划、国营商业的零售牌价和其他规定条件出售代销商品。代销店不再向自由市场购进代销商品。
    国营商业以国家的商品委托资本主义进出口商按照规定条件向资本主义市场代为销售，给以手续费，也是代销的一种形式。
    代批：国营商业以国家的商品委托资本主义批发商向私营零售商代为批售，给以手续费。代批店缴存一定的保证金，并按照国营商业规定条件批售代批商品。其中营业额较大的，国营商业得派专职干部经常进行领导和监督。
    代购：国营商业或合作社商业指定品种、规格、数量和订购或收购价格，委托资本主义商业在国外资本主义市场代为订购进口商品或在国内市场代为收购农产品，并给以手续费。
    三、公私合营：根据国家需要、企业改造的可能和资本家自愿，由国家投资并派干部同资本家实行合营。
    公私联营：国营公司根据需要和可能组织一批资本主义进出口商，对某一宗或若干宗进出口业务实行公私联合经营，即对资本主义市场进出口贸易方面的公私联购联销。
    公私联购：根据公私双方的需要，由国营公司组织资本主义商业，规定公私资金比例、收购计划和收购地区，在国营公司或合作社直接领导下，公私双方联合到产地去收购；购得的商品按照国营公司牌价实行联销或分销（亦可采取公带私购，公方不参加资金的方式，这种方式经济上虽无联系，但对城乡物资交流，还是起一定作用的）。
　  三
　　资本主义零售商业从业人员众多，它在今后比较长的时期内，在国营商业领导下，对于扩大社会商品流转，供应居民需要，还有一定的作用，因此，纳入国家资本主义轨道的主要对象是资本主义零售商。
    资本主义零售商全部业务实行经销的，具有下列的优越性：
    一、全部商品实行经销的国家资本主义商业，它原有的资本主义盲目经营和投机倒把行为受到了很大的限制；同时企业的货源和销售计划完全受到国家计划的支配；它被国家利用，协助国营商业和合作社商业扩大商品流转，完成国家供应计划。
    二、资本家所得的批零差价，其中虽然包括一部分利润，但由于整个业务为国营公司经销并按国营公司牌价出售，资本主义的剥削在很大程度上被限制了。
    三、通过经销形式，具体地固定了领导和被领导的直接关系，使国营商业或合作社商业更加加强了对资本主义企业的领导地位。职工的劳动已不是完全被资本家利用来追逐利润，而主要是为完成国家销售计划，供应居民需要服务。跟着社会主义商业领导的加强，职工监督作用的发挥，它原有的资本主义的经营管理和经营作风也就有可能逐步地获得改进。
    四、企业纳入了国家资本主义轨道，不仅有利于对原有企业进行利用、限制和改造，并使原有商业从业人员能继续就业下去，既可免除国家为他们重新安排工作的困难，也能在维持的情况下，对资本家和资本家代理人进行改造。
      批购零销是国家资本主义商业的初级形式，这种形式优点是：由于条件较宽，容易将资本主义零销商纳入国家资本主义轨道；缺点是国家对它们的控制较宽，改造较为困难，因此在条件具备时，需要逐步地指导和鼓励它们转为经销或代销。
    经批的优越性大体上和经销相同。
    全部商品实行代销的国家资本主义商业，除具有上述经销形式的优越性外，资本主义的私人所有制虽依然存在，但已起了变化。资本家的极大部分资本变作保证金，存在国家银行或者缴存国营商业或合作社商业，资本家不可能再用这一部分资本从事于资本主义的盲目经营和投机倒把。同时，职工在企业中的地位也有一定的改变。代销店中不仅职工的监督作用将逐步增强，而且还将受到消费者的经常和广泛的监督。由于国家资本主义代销店具有上述优点，在经过长时期企业改造和人的改造工作后，就有利于将代销店转变为社会主义的销售机构，将资本家和资本家代理人改变为社会主义商业的工作人员。因此代销优于经销。
    代批的优越性大体上是和代销相同的。国内市场农产品的代购是季节性的，对企业和对资本家改造的作用较少。
    至于具体运用时究竟采取何种形式，这要视当地国营商业或合作社商业的需要和可能，结合那里的资本主义商业的不同经营情况来决定。
    上述经销、代销的优越性，必须经过很多政治的和经济的工作，才能逐步地实现。
    公私合营虽是高级形式，但由于资本主义商业规模小，面广而又分散，社会购买力的增长是有一定限度的，资本主义商业实行公私合营后，营业额增加，就会影响同一行业内的多数商店，增加国家对私营商业进行全业安排的困难。因此，对资本主义商业的安排和改造，公私合营形式不宜作为发展方向。只宜对兼有加工制造或有很大技术性的商业个别地采用，同时又必须和同一行业的安排和改造结合起来进行。
    对资本主义市场进出口贸易方面的公私联营和农副产品的公私联购形式，目前可以根据具体情况来采用。
      四
    国家对资本主义商业的社会主义改造，一般是采取逐行逐业进行的，因为市场的组织化和计划化需要区分不同商品按行业进行，同时也只有逐行逐业安排，才能使资本主义商业从业人员继续获得就业和改造的机会，同时可以充分发挥他们的业务经验，有利于扩大商品流转。
    逐行逐业改造是包括这个行业的小商小贩在内的，对它们也可以采取经销、代销、批购零销和代购等形式，这些形式看来虽和国家资本主义的经销、代销、批购零销和代购一样，但由于小商小贩 一般没有或仅有少量资本，开设小规模商店或肩挑叫卖和摆摊出售，不雇用店员或只雇个别店员，以自己从事商品流转中的劳动为生活的全部或主要来源，他们是劳动人民，因此对他们采用的这些形式在性质上也就不属于国家资本主义的范畴。
    对资本主义商业的社会主义改造是过渡时期的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。国家把资本主义商业逐行逐业纳入各种形式的国家资本主义轨道以后，虽然更有利于国家对它们的利用、限制和改造，但这仅仅是改造工作的开始，决不能认为改造工作已经完成。事实证明，不少资本主义商业实行了经销、代销以后，因为它们经营管理不善、费用开支大，以致影响到这些企业不能维持。也有不少资本家、小业主仍然有掺假掺杂、短秤少量、抬价拒售、跌价竞销，甚至盗用国营商业和合作社商业的物资，挪用国家资金等违法活动。因此，必须把企业的改造和对人的改造结合起来进行。这就是说，一方面要通过企业改革，逐步地使它们适应社会主义商业的需要；另一方面要通过对资本家和资本家代理人的改造，尽可能使他们在社会主义改造中起积极的有益的作用。但是如何有领导地督促他们改进经营管理，改变经营作风，有步骤地降低费用开支，如何在可能条件下调整商业网，如何对这些商业资本家和资本家代理人进行监督和教育，如何制止他们的违法行为以及系统地进行思想改造和业务训练，是一件长期的、艰巨而复杂的工作。这就需要各地主管改造资本主义商业的行政部门和有关的国营商业或合作社商业加强对他们的管理和领导，积极地发动并依靠职工和消费者实行对他们的监督，通过工商业联合会和同业工会组织，加强对商业资本家的爱国守法和接受社会主义改造的教育，在党的统一领导下，有计划有步骤地来完成改造资本主义企业和资产阶级分子的伟大历史任务。
