Dear Editor:

I have seen in news reports that Senator Jenner deemed it appropriate to mention my name in a recent hearing of the U.S. Senate committee regarding Mr. and Mrs. John W. Powell—respected American journalists who had a long association with the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai. He made a sweeping insinuation that any American who has had contact with me or my work over the years—and there are many such people—is in some way a traitor to their country. This compels me to express my views.

Anyone familiar with the situation in China knows that I have had the honor of leading organizations at different times—the China Defense League, the China Welfare Fund, and the China Welfare Institute. These organizations made it possible for friends from all over the world to join us in providing medical and other services to the Chinese people during the difficult times in our history, namely, the Japanese invasion of China, the civil war expanded by foreign interference, famine, and economic collapse. Due to the spirit that has always been present in the work, this work has also become a symbol of the friendship between peoples of all countries on the basis of their right to forge their own destiny.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the patrons of our China Defense League included Americans with various viewpoints, from Paul Robeson to Clare Boothe Luce, as well as international figures such as Jawaharlal Nehru. The American organization with which we maintained the closest contact at that time was led by Anna Roosevelt, the mother of the late President Roosevelt. Later, some Americans who had helped our work began to think they could dictate what kind of government China should accept, so we parted ways. Others left because they were under pressure in the United States. Some who continued to act on the belief that the people of China and the United States could and should live peacefully together on a basis of mutual respect, and who stood up against any aggression, have suffered what can only be described as vicious persecution.

People everywhere will recognize that the case of the Powells is a striking example of this persecution. The American magazine published by the Powells in China for thirty years advocated the above opinion, and they were not afraid to spread this opinion among their compatriots after returning home. Mr. Powell is being accused of "treason." His wife lost her job due to public persecution. Even their young children have been implicated. Senator Jenner and Welker, and other interrogators in this case, are clearly aiming at a larger goal: to portray all those who advocate peaceful understanding between peoples of different political and economic paths as "traitors."

Are we to believe that the U.S. government believes that the only patriotic Americans are those whose concern for our country is limited to pursuing war and subverting the system that we established after a century of struggle and that we have found in practice to be very suitable for us? If so, then the situation in the United States is extremely harmful to world peace. As for myself—and I know that most of my compatriots feel the same way—I do not believe that rational and freedom-loving Americans hold this view.

In China, advocating good international relations and peaceful coexistence, that is, the irrefutable principle of "live and let live," has been regarded as part of patriotism, just like rising up to defend our inalienable right to arrange various affairs in our own country. We believe that this is part of patriotism in any country. The Powell case, like other cases in the United States, shows how brutal efforts are being made there to deny this principle of humanity and common sense, which all civilized countries have accepted for so long, and to replace it with the ideas that we fought against alongside Americans when the Nazis and Japanese militarists threatened everything we cherished. Most of my compatriots certainly do not believe that the American people will allow their reason and courage to be submerged, as the reason and courage of the Germans and Japanese were once submerged.

Your faithful,

Soong Ching Ling

Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: John W. Powell, mentioned in the letter, was the former editor of the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai and a representative of the American delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in 1952. After he left China and returned to the United States in August 1953, he was "investigated" by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was under great pressure to abandon his views on China and to stop criticizing U.S. policy toward China. When various means of bribery and threats failed, the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee subpoenaed Powell on September 27, 1954. His wife, Sylvia Cain Powell, was then subpoenaed. Less than two hours after this subpoena, Powell's wife was fired from the Infantile Paralysis Foundation, where she worked.

On March 20, 1955, the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee released a report on the so-called investigation of Powell. This report falsely accused Powell of "unspeakable acts of betraying America's cause in the Far East." The so-called "acts of betraying America's cause in the Far East" refer to the fact that the "China Weekly Review," edited by Powell, published articles telling the truth about the Korean War, that he personally conveyed messages for American prisoners of war in Korea and their families, and that he introduced the reality of New China to the American people and criticized the U.S. government's policy toward China after returning to the United States. The report announced that it would continue to subpoena Powell.

### 宋庆龄给美国“民族”周刊的公开信

专栏：

　　宋庆龄给美国“民族”周刊的公开信亲爱的编辑先生：
    我从新闻报道中看到，在最近美国参议院委员会的一次关于约·威·鲍惠尔夫妇——和上海“密勒氏评论报”有过长时期联系的受人尊敬的美国记者——的意见听取会上，参议员真纳认为提到我的名字是恰当的。他作了一个概括的暗示，认为凡是多年来和我或我的工作有过联系的美国人——这样的人有好多——无论怎样都是他们国家的卖国贼。这就使我不得不发表一下意见。
    凡是熟悉中国情况的人，都知道我有幸在不同时期领导过的那些团体——保卫中国大同盟、中国福利基金会和中国福利会。这些团体使全世界各地的朋友有可能同我们一起，在我们历史上的危难时期，也就是中国受到日本侵略、因外国干涉而扩大的内战、灾荒和经济崩溃的时期，对中国人民提供医药和其他方面的服务。由于在进行工作时一直具有的那种精神，因此这项工作也成为各国人民在彼此有权铸造其本身命运的基础之上的友谊的象征。
    在抗日战争期间，我们的保卫中国同盟的赞助人中包括具有各种观点的美国人，从保罗·罗伯逊到克莱尔·布思·卢斯，以及像贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁那样的国际人物。我们当时与之保持最密切联系的美国团体是由故总统罗斯福的母亲安娜·罗斯福领导的。后来，在当时帮助我们的工作的一些美国人开始认为，他们能够指令中国接受怎样的政府统治，因此，我们就分手了。另外一些人因为在美国受到了压力而离开了。有些继续根据他们认为中美两国人民能够而且应当在彼此尊重的基础上和平相处的信念行事的人，和挺身反对任何侵略的人，都受到只能称为恶毒的迫害的遭遇。
    各地人士将认识到鲍惠尔夫妇的案件是这种迫害的显著的例子。鲍惠尔夫妇的在中国出版了三十年之久的美国杂志赞成上述的意见，他们并不害怕在回国后把这种意见在本国同胞之间传布。鲍惠尔先生正被指控为犯有“叛国”罪。他的夫人因受到公开迫害而失去了工作。甚至他们的几个年幼的孩
  子也遭到牵累。参议员真纳和威尔克以及这个案件
  的其他质询人显然是要达到一个更大的目的：把所有主张在遵循不同的政治和经济道路的各国人民之
  间实现和平谅解的人都说成是“卖国贼”。
    是否要我们认为，美国政府认为唯一爱国的美国人是那些对我国的关心仅限于追求战争和颠覆我
  们在斗争了一个世纪之后才建立起来的、而且我们
  在实践中发觉非常适合我们的制度的美国人？如果是这样，那么美国的情况就是一个对世界和平极其有害的情况。就我本人而言——我知道我国大多数同胞也是这样——我不相信，有理性的和爱好自由的美国人也是持有这种见解的。
    在中国，主张国际间保持良好关系和和平共处，即“自己活也让人家活”这一颠扑不破的原则，已被认为是同起而维护我们在自己的国土上安排各种事务的不可剥夺的权利一样，同是爱国主义的一部分。我们认为，在任何一个国家中，这都是爱国主义的一部分。鲍惠尔案件，像美国的其他的案件一样，说明有人正在那边作如何粗暴的努力，企图否认所有文明的国家已接受了这样久的这一人道和常识的原理，而代之以当纳粹分子和日本军国主义者威胁着我们所珍贵的一切时我们同美国人并肩作战来反对的那些观念。我国的大多数同胞肯定地不相信美国人民会允许他们的理性和勇气被淹没，像德国人和日本人的理性和勇气曾一度被淹没那样。
                        你的忠实的
                                  宋庆龄
                                  （新华社）
    新华社编者按：信中提到的约翰·威·鲍惠尔是前上海“密勒氏评论报”主编、参加一九五二年在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表团代表。他在一九五三年八月离开中国回美国后，就受到美国联邦调查局的“调查”。他受到了很大的压力，要他放弃他对于中国的见解，要他不再批评美国的对华政策。当各种收买和威胁手段都未能得逞以后，一九五四年九月二十七日，美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯了鲍惠尔。接着又传讯了他的妻子锡尔维亚·坎·鲍惠尔。在这次传讯后不到两小时，鲍惠尔的妻子就被她所服务的那个团体小儿麻痹基金会解雇了。
    美国参议院国内安全小组委员会在一九五五年三月二十日发表了一份对鲍惠尔的所谓侦讯情况的报告。这个报告诬蔑鲍惠尔有“不堪言状的出卖美国在远东的事业的行为”。所谓“出卖美国在远东的事业的行为”，就是指鲍惠尔主编的“密勒氏评论报”发表了说出朝鲜战争的真相的文章，他本人为在朝鲜的美国战俘和他们的家庭传递了消息，以及在回到美国后向美国人民介绍了新中国的实况并且批评了美国政府的对华政策。这个报告宣布要继续传讯鲍惠尔。
