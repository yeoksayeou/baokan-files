Is There a Conflict Between Leading Rural Branches and Doing the Current Central Work?
　　Ding Li
    Currently, some county and district party workers have a mistaken idea: "To complete the current work tasks, one cannot do branch work; to do branch work will affect the current work." They pit strengthening leadership over branches against completing central tasks. Thus, when they arrange and inspect work, they only mention central tasks and rarely or never mention branch work. When they go to the countryside to work, they do not inquire about branch work. Some even say when asked to help solve problems in branch work, "I haven't finished my own work, how can I have time to deal with these things!" They oppose discussing branch work. For example, the Twelfth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Suihua County, Heilongjiang, has not discussed party building work in its district committee meetings for half a year. When the organization committee member proposed discussing party building issues, the district committee secretary even rebuked him, saying, "Why are you engaging in this decentralism?"
    Of course, the work of county and district committees is currently heavy, and county and district committees should actively complete the party's central work. But it must be recognized that the party's grassroots organizations are the foundation of the party, and the task of the party's grassroots organizations is to carry out propaganda and organizational work among the people to realize the party's propositions and the resolutions of higher-level party organizations. This of course requires the party's grassroots organizations to carry out their work according to these requirements, but it also requires higher-level party organizations to regard the party's grassroots organizations as the core fortress for the party to carry out work among the people, as a bridge connecting the party's leading organs and the people, and as the most important link in implementing the party's various policies among the masses. The party realizes its tasks through the party’s grassroots organizations carrying out work among the people. Therefore, strengthening leadership over the party's grassroots organizations and completing the party's central tasks are not only not contradictory, but also unified. Only by fully exerting the fighting fortress role of the party's grassroots organizations can the party's central tasks be better completed. For example, after the Shuangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party changed its leadership ideology and leadership style in 1954, it paid attention to the leadership of grassroots organizations and rectified 80 percent of the county's branches through the central work of various periods. After rectification, the communist consciousness of the members of these branches was greatly improved, and they actively participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, becoming strong backbone members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and various tasks. This result of unifying the leadership of central work and the leadership of party building work not only guaranteed the regular leadership of grassroots organizations, but also guaranteed the completion of various tasks. Facts have proved that there is no conflict between leading rural branches and doing the current central work.

　　领导农村支部和做好当前中心工作有矛盾吗？
　　丁力
    目前在某些县和区的党的工作人员中，有这样一种错误的说法：“要完成当前工作任务，就不能搞支部工作，要搞支部工作，就会影响当前工作。”把加强对支部的领导和完成中心任务对立起来。这样，他们在布置和检查工作时，只提中心任务，不提或很少提支部工作；他们下乡工作时，不过问支部工作，甚至有人提出支部工作中的问题请他们帮助解决时，他们说：“我的事还没干完哪，那有空来管这些事！”他们反对讨论支部工作。如中共黑龙江绥化县十二区区委半年来就没有在区委会议上讨论党的建设工作，当组织委员提议讨论党的建设问题时，区委书记还责备他说：“你搞这个分散主义干嘛？”
    当然，目前县、区委的工作是繁重的，而且县、区委也应当积极地来完成党的中心工作。但是必须认识：党的基层组织是党的基础，党的基层组织的任务就是在人民群众中进行宣传工作和组织工作，以实现党的主张和上级党组织的各项决议。这当然要求党的基层组织按着这些要求去进行自己的工作，但是同时要求上级党的组织也必须把党的基层组织当作是党在人民群众中进行工作的核心堡垒，是党的领导机关和人民群众联系的桥梁，是把党的各项政策贯彻到群众中去的最重要环节，通过党的基层组织在人民群众中进行工作，以实现自己的任务。因此，加强对党的基层组织的领导和完成党的中心任务，不但不矛盾，而且是统一的，也只有充分发挥了党的基层组织战斗堡垒作用后，才能更好地完成党的中心任务。如中共黑龙江双城县委自一九五四年转变领导思想和领导作风之后，便注意了对基层组织的领导，通过各个时期的中心工作整顿了全县百分之八十的支部。经过整顿后，这些支部中的党员的共产主义觉悟大大提高，积极地参加了互助合作组织，成为互助合作运动和各项工作中的坚强的骨干分子。这种把领导中心工作和领导党的建设工作统一起来的结果，既保证了对基层组织的经常领导，又保证了各项工作的完成。事实证明，领导农村支部和做好当前中心工作是没有矛盾的。
