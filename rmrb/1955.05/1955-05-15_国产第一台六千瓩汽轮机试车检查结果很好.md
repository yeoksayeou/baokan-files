Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th: The pre-delivery trials of China's first domestically-made 6,000 kW steam turbine have yielded excellent results. Some time ago, a working group dispatched by the First Ministry of Machine Building, together with representatives from the Ministry of Fuel Industries and professors from the Power Machinery Manufacturing Department of Jiaotong University, inspected the no-load operation of this turbine at the state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory. They also opened the cylinder to inspect the main mechanisms and parts. In the trial operation record book jointly signed by them, they concluded that the trial operation and post-trial inspection results were excellent.

Each component and major part of this steam turbine has undergone a technical summary, and new work-hour quotas and detailed process specifications have been formulated separately.

Currently, small-batch trial production of this type of steam turbine has begun.

The engineers and professors who participated in the pre-delivery inspection of the first 6,000 kW steam turbine spoke at a symposium about the significance of China's successful self-manufacture of the 6,000 kW steam turbine. Zhang Jingtai, an engineer from the Production and Technology Department of the Electricity Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industries, said: People usually measure a country's level of the machine industry by its steam turbine manufacturing technology. The Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory's manufacturing of the first 6,000 kW steam turbine is a new milestone in China's industrialization journey. This steam turbine is manufactured based on the most advanced design provided by the Czechoslovak Republic. This design includes their decades of valuable experience and the latest technological achievements in the modern steam turbine manufacturing industry. Given that the vast majority of power plants in our country currently have old and outdated equipment, the birth of the first domestically-made 6,000 kW steam turbine will be a new beginning for the development of our country's power industry.

In the process of trial-producing China's first 6,000 kW steam turbine, the state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory saw the emergence of seventy-three advanced workers and outstanding workers, and one hundred and seventy-four employees received commendations. Among the awarded employees is the famous labor model Zhu Shunyu, who, since April 1954, has improved fifteen tools and machines used in the manufacture of steam turbines.

　　国产第一台六千瓩汽轮机试车检查结果很好
    据新华社上海十四日电　我国自制的第一台六千瓩汽轮机出厂前的试车检查结果很好。不久以前，第一机械工业部派来的工作组，会同燃料工业部的代表和交通大学动力机械制造系的教授，在国营上海汽轮机厂检查了这台汽轮机的空车运转情况，并打开汽缸检验了主要的机构和零件。在他们共同签署的试运转记录书上，作出了试车情况及试车后检查结果很好的结论。
    这台汽轮机的每个部套和主要零件，都已作过技术总结，分别订出了新的工时定额和详细的工艺规程。
    现在，这种汽轮机已开始小批试制。
    参加第一台六千瓩汽轮机出厂检查的工程师和教授，在一次座谈会上讲述了我国自制六千瓩汽轮机成功的意义。燃料工业部电业管理总局生产技术处工程师张景泰说：人们通常是以汽轮机的制造技术来衡量一个国家的机械工业水平的。上海汽轮机厂制成了第一台六千瓩汽轮机，是我国工业化途程中一个新的路标。这台汽轮机是根据捷克斯洛伐克共和国供给的最先进的设计制造的，这种设计包括了他们几十年来的宝贵经验和近代汽轮机制造工业中最新的技术成就。在目前我国发电厂绝大部分是老旧设备的情况下，第一台国产六千瓩汽轮机的诞生，将是我国电力工业新的发展开端。
    在试制我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机过程中，国营上海汽轮机厂出现了七十三个先进工作者和优胜工作者，有一百七十四个职工记了功。受奖的职工中，有著名的劳动模范朱顺余，他从一九五四年四月以来，又改进了十五件制造汽轮机用的工具和机器设备。
