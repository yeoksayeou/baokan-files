Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th. British Labour MP John Strachey questioned British Prime Minister Eden in the House of Commons on the 28th, saying: "Has he noticed the frequent claims now appearing in American newspapers that if the current government remains in power after the general election, this country will undertake an obligation to use our troops to maintain the government of Chiang Kai-shek?" Eden replied that it was "completely untrue" to say that Britain had undertaken such an obligation, or that the British government had considered undertaking such an obligation.

Strachey then asked Eden to give a pre-election public guarantee that if the Conservatives won the election, "the government would under no circumstances undertake the obligation to defend the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Taiwan."

Eden refused to answer this question directly. He said: "My statement covers everything."

Labour MP Alfred Robens then raised a similar question, which Eden again refused to answer directly.

In response to another question from Labour MP Arthur Henderson, Eden said: "British foreign policy is based on the United Nations Charter. The Five Principles generally seem to be consistent with the United Nations Charter, so we have agreed to these principles."

　  艾登在下院答工党议员质询
    新华社二十九日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党议员约翰·斯特拉彻二十八日在下院中质问英国首相艾登说：他“是否曾注意到现在美国报纸上经常出现的说法：如果目前的政府经过大选仍然执政，这个国家将承担一项义务，用我们的部队来维持蒋介石的政府？”艾登回答说：如果说英国已经承担这种义务，或英国政府已经考虑承担这种义务，是“丝毫不符事实的。”
    斯特拉彻接着要求艾登作一项选举前的公开保证：如果保守党赢得胜利，“政府在任何情况下决不承担保卫在台湾的蒋介石政权的义务。”
    艾登拒绝直接回答这个问题。他说：“我的声明包括了一切。”
    工党议员艾尔弗雷德·罗本斯接着提出了一个类似的问题，艾登再次拒绝直接回答这个问题。
    艾登在答复工党议员阿瑟·汉德逊的另一个问题时说：“英国外交政策是以联合国宪章为基础的。五项原则一般说来似乎同联合国宪章是一致的，因此我们已经同意了这些原则。”
