Peking University Holds Scientific Discussion Forum

The 1954-1955 academic year scientific discussion forum of Peking University opened on May 4th, the 57th anniversary of the university.

In addition to all the teachers and graduate students of Peking University, principals or representatives from national comprehensive universities, representatives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and representatives from relevant industrial sectors were invited to participate in the discussion forum. Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, and Vice Ministers Huang Songling, Zeng Zhaolun, and Liu Aifeng attended the meeting. Members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation, analytical chemistry expert Tananaev, orientalist Astafiev, and Vice President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Ligeti, were also invited to attend.

At the plenary session on the 4th, Soviet expert Sapozhnikov first reported on "The Significance of Marxist Dialectical Method for Scientific Research Work," and then Wang Zisong, a lecturer in the Department of Philosophy, reported on his paper "Criticizing Hu Shih's Pragmatist Philosophy," co-authored with Jin Yuelin, Zhang Shiying, Huang Nansen, and others.

A total of one hundred scientific papers will be presented for discussion at this scientific discussion forum. Among them, sixty-four are in the natural sciences and thirty-six are in the humanities. Since the meeting primarily aims to implement the spirit of criticizing academic thought, nearly half of the papers in the humanities are criticisms of the bourgeois reactionary academic thought of Hu Shih, Hu Feng, and others.

　  北京大学举行科学讨论会
    北京大学一九五四—一九五五学年科学讨论会，在五月四日该校五十七周年校庆日开幕。
    参加这次讨论会的，除北京大学全体教师、研究生等以外，并有全国各综合大学的校长或代表，中国科学院代表，及各有关产业部门的代表应邀参加。高等教育部部长杨秀峰、副部长黄松龄、曾昭抡、刘皑风和中国科学院副院长张稼夫都曾到会。苏联科学院代表团团员、分析化学专家塔纳纳耶夫，东方学家阿斯塔菲耶夫和匈牙利科学院副院长利格蒂也应邀出席。
    在四日的全会上，首先由苏联专家萨坡什尼可夫报告了“马克思主义辩证方法对科学研究工作的意义”，又由哲学系讲师汪子嵩报告了他和金岳霖、张世英、黄楠森等合写的论文“批判胡适实用主义哲学”。
    将在这次科学讨论会上提出讨论的科学论文共有一百篇。其中自然科学方面的六十四篇，人文科学方面的三十六篇。由于会议首先是贯彻对学术思想进行批判的精神，所以人文科学方面的论文近一半是批判胡适、胡风等的资产阶级反动学术思想。
