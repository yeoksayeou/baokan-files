Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th. Antara News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia issued a statement on the 17th regarding the treaty signed between China and Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality.

The statement said that this treaty provides the possibility for a democratic and appropriate resolution of the dual nationality issue. This treaty is a victory for resolving international issues through consultation on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit.

　　就双重国籍问题条约发表声明
    新华社雅加达十八日电　安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会十七日就中国和印度尼西亚签订关于双重国籍问题的条约发表声明。
    声明说，这个条约为双重国籍问题取得民主和适当的解决提供了可能性。这个条约是在平等、互相尊重和互利的基础上通过协商来解决国际问题的一个胜利。
    声明说，双重国籍问题的解决是非常重要的，因为它提供了许多可能性，以便在沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和周恩来总理四月二十八日发表的联合声明中所确定的原则的基础上促进印度尼西亚和人民中国之间的和平友好与合作。
    声明说，废除双重国籍意味着消除或者至少是减少引起印度尼西亚人和具有中国血统的人之间的冲突的原因。
  声明最后要求各党派和群众团体为实现这个条约而努力，并且要求所有中国血统的人按照这个条约的规定选择一种国籍，做印度尼西亚的或者中华人民共和国的好公民。
