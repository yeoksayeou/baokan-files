　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 27th: A Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong Government Information Services issued a special communiqué on the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash incident on the 27th.

　　The communiqué stated: The Indonesian investigation committee's report has determined that the plane crash incident was caused by sabotage.

　　The communiqué stated: After the wreckage of the plane was examined by technical experts, "the Hong Kong government was notified that the plane crash was almost certainly caused by an explosion in the right wing, and the explosion was caused by explosives placed behind the No. 3 engine in the right wing." The communiqué said: "Given the time factor (because the usual type of time bomb is set to explode within twelve hours), it seems most likely that the explosives were actually placed on the plane while it was in Hong Kong."

　　The communiqué also stated: "This information has narrowed the scope of the investigation, making it possible to focus the investigation on those in Hong Kong who may have placed the explosives on this Indian plane." The communiqué said that this investigation "is being carried out with maximum effort."

　　The communiqué also stated: "The Hong Kong government is determined to make every effort to investigate the facts, and if it is determined that this crime was committed in Hong Kong, they are determined to do everything possible to bring the perpetrators to justice."

　　香港英国当局就飞机失事事件发表公报
    新华社广州二十七日电　香港消息：香港政府新闻处二十七日发表了关于“克什米尔公主号”失事事件的特别公报。
    公报说：印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告已经确定，飞机失事的事件是由于破坏而造成的。
    公报说：在飞机残骸受到技术专家的检查之后，“香港政府即接到通知说，飞机失事几乎可以肯定是由于右翼的爆炸而造成的，而爆炸是由于在右翼第三号引擎背后所安放的爆炸物所引起的。”公报说：“鉴于时间的因素（因为通常类型的定时炸弹是要在十二小时以内爆炸的），看来最可能的是，爆炸物事实上是当飞机在香港停留的时候被安放在飞机上的。”
    公报又说：“这一情报使调查范围得以缩小，因而有可能集中侦查在香港的那些可能把爆炸物安放在这一印度飞机上的人们。”公报说，这一侦查“正在以最大努力进行中。”
    公报又说：“香港政府决心作一切努力来调查事实，如果经确定这种罪行是在香港犯的，他们决心尽全力来使肇事者归案法办。”
