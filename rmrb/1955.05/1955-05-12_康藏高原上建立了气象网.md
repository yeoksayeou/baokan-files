A meteorological network has been established by the many meteorological stations established on the Kangzang Plateau. Now Beijing can know the weather changes on the Kangzang Plateau at any time. Farmers in various parts of Xikang can prevent damage to crops from cold waves, frost, strong winds, heavy snow, etc., based on the weather forecasts of the Xikang Provincial Meteorological Observatory. The Xikang Provincial Meteorological Observatory and the Xikang Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau are revising the weather forecast supply contract, requiring the Meteorological Observatory to forecast rainy weather to the deep mountain forest areas on time, so that workers can grasp the sunny and rainy weather and the river water rise and fall times for timber rafting. The Meteorological Observatory will also sign a contract with the asbestos mine recently, so that workers can grasp the weather changes when drying cotton. The meteorological station has mastered the wind and snow conditions along the Kangzang Highway, which has also played a certain role in vehicle dispatch.
 When establishing meteorological stations on the Kangzang Plateau, the cadres of the meteorological station overcame many difficulties. The cadres who went to the Jinsha River to build a station carried equipment, carried heavy hydrogen cylinders, climbed mountains and waded through rivers, and walked for twenty-one days; on rainy days, they covered the equipment with raincoats, preferring to get wet themselves rather than damage the meteorological equipment.

### 康藏高原上建立了气象网

　　康藏高原上建立了气象网
    康藏高原上建立的许多气象站已形成了一个气象网。现在北京可以随时知道康藏高原上天气变化的情况。西康各地农民可以根据西康省气象台的天气预报，预防寒潮、霜冻、大风、大雪等对庄稼的侵害。西康省气象台和西康省森林工业局正在改订天气预报的供应合同，气象台要按时向深山林区预报阴雨情况，使工人们掌握晴雨和河水涨落时间漂运木材。气象台最近还要和石棉矿订立合同，使工人晒棉时能掌握天气的变化。气象站掌握了康藏公路沿线的风雪情况，对车辆的调度也起了一定的作用。
    气象站的干部在康藏高原上建立气象站时克服了许多困难。去金沙江边建站的干部，背着器材，抬着沉重的氢气缸，爬山涉水，走了二十一天；下雨天，他们把雨衣盖在器材上，宁愿自己淋湿，不使气象设备受损失。（新华社）
