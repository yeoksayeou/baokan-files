Editor's Note: Before the publication of Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" in this newspaper on May 13, many people were deceived by Hu Feng, believing that the mistakes of him and his faction seemed to be only ideological, and not necessarily political. People felt their anti-Marxism, and some felt their attack on the Party, but they did not feel, or did not deeply feel, whether they were against the revolution. Are Hu Feng and his faction, apart from those who were truly deceived and blindly followed him, some people in the revolutionary ranks who have made mistakes? Or a group of people with ulterior motives and origins who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, using the guise of revolution, and aiming to sabotage the revolution? People were not clear about this issue. The publication of Shu Wu's "Materials" awakened all revolutionary readers. Indeed, as long as one truly supports the revolution, no one who reads this article will not express indignation. This newspaper has received many articles and letters, which will be published selectively from today onwards. Hu Feng has deceived us for more than 20 years, and the time has come to clarify the matter. There are several types of people in the Hu Feng group: core members and general members. Among the core members, there are those who resolutely follow Hu Feng and those who are willing to repent. We call on all Hu Feng members who are willing to repent to stand up, criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and start anew. We hope that all readers will pay attention to the following issue: We should be vigilant against people like Hu Feng and Hu Feng members who pretend to support the Communist Party but actually oppose the Communist Party, pretend to support the people but actually oppose the people, and pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and not be deceived by them forever. Such sham revolutionaries like Hu Feng, or similar to Hu Feng, are of course a minority, but they are very harmful. They can infiltrate our Party, military, state organs, cultural organs, people's organizations, and enterprise organs and do many bad things. If we do not raise our vigilance, do not clarify their problems, and do not stop their sabotage activities, but allow them to continue to "contact people," "win people over," "engage in pioneering work," and "greatly strengthen their strength," that is, allow them to develop and expand day by day, they will use their "cluster grenades" to seriously damage our revolutionary cause.

　　The Anti-Party Behavior of Hu Feng Must Be Thoroughly Liquidated
　　Ouyang Yuqian

    Hu Feng opposed writers mastering the communist worldview; opposed writers combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers; opposed writers undergoing ideological remolding; opposed national forms; opposed literature and art serving the current political tasks; and advocated dissolving unified organizations in literary and art circles and abolishing the Party's leadership. With him like this, no one can believe that he is not anti-Party.

    Hu Feng had his organized small group, and dressed it in Marxist clothes, raised the banner of progress, and used various methods, employing his small group, to consistently and systematically oppose the Party's literary and artistic thought, the Party's literary and artistic policy, and the Party's organizational leadership of literary and art circles; not only that, he not only came up with a set of his literary and artistic program, but also formulated a set of strategies and tactics, instructing his small group members to take resolute and fierce actions to oppose the revolutionary literary and artistic cause, how can this not be said to be conscious anti-Party!

    Hu Feng's anti-Party behavior is not only generally insisting on ideological errors, but also taking Marxism and the Party's leadership as the object of his "subjective struggle" and carrying out malicious sabotage. However, in his "My Self-Criticism" article, he still wants to lightly say that the root of his error is only:
  "Taking the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and position of the working class, confusing the principled differences between them." Isn't this still deception? Hu Feng still wants to use a set of selectively quoted Marxist theory to defend himself and make strategic retreats. This is not allowed! Look at Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group"! Hu Feng simply regards the leading comrades of the Party in literary and artistic work and many progressive writers united around the Party as enemies, arbitrarily cursing and slandering them maliciously; he used the "tactics of cluster grenades" to deal with the revolutionary literary and artistic front, released countless sinister poisonous arrows against progressive writers, slandered them wantonly; he even wanted to use the rubber whip used by Japanese secret agents to treat Kobayashi Takiji and Kuomintang bandits and special agents to treat revolutionary elements to deal with them, believing that "if there is a trace of hope for them, then one is humiliating oneself," so one can only "shake hands and make peace with them with a smile covering insult." Judging from the many letters published, it is clear that he has consistently regarded the Chinese Communist Party as an enemy. He even said that to his enemies "... one can only meet them head-on, and one must be determined to coexist and die with the position."

    Extreme crazy bourgeois individualism and extremely stubborn bourgeois idealism are the ideological foundation of Hu Feng, but all of Hu Feng's actions have exceeded the scope of ideological problems, and its harm is very great in every respect, not only in literary and art circles. The anti-Party thoughts and actions of Hu Feng must be thoroughly liquidated.

### 应当彻底清算胡风的反党行为

专栏：

    编者按：在舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”一文在五月十三日本报发表以前，很多人都被胡风所欺骗，认为他和他那一派人的错误似乎只是思想方面的，而未必是政治方面的。人们感到了他们的反马克思主义，也有些人感到了他们的向党进攻，但是没有感到或者没有深刻地感到他们是否反对革命的问题。胡风和他的一派，除了那些真正被欺骗、因而盲目地跟着他跑的人们以外，其余的人，究竟是革命队伍里犯有错误的一些人呢？还是钻进革命队伍、打着革命的假招牌、而以破坏革命为目的的一群别有用心和别有来历的人呢？人们对于这个问题是弄不清楚的。舒芜“材料”一文的发表，唤醒了一切革命的读者。的确，只要是真正拥护革命的人，读了这文没有不表示愤慨的。本报收到了许多文章和信件，从今天起将择要陆续发表。胡风欺骗我们二十多年了，事情已到可以弄清的时候了。胡风集团中的人有几种情况，有骨干分子，有一般分子。骨干分子中，有坚决跟胡风跑的，也有愿意改悔的。我们号召一切愿意改悔的胡风分子站出来批判自己，揭露胡风，重新做人。我们希望一切读者注意这样一个问题：对于像胡风和胡风分子这样一种伪装拥护共产党而实际反对共产党，伪装拥护人民而实际反对人民，伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的人，我们应当提高警惕，不要被他们永远欺骗下去。像胡风或类似胡风的这种冒称革命的伪装分子当然是少数，但是为害却甚大，他们可以钻进我们的党内，军内，国家机关内，文化机关内，人民团体内和企业机关内，做出许多坏事来。如果我们不提高警惕，不把他们的问题弄清楚，不把他们的破坏活动加以制止，而让他们继续不断地“联络人”、“争取人”、“从事开辟工作”、“大大地加强实力”，即是说让他们一天一天发展和扩大下去，他们就要用他们的“集束手榴弹”给我们的革命事业以严重的损害。
　　应当彻底清算胡风的反党行为
　　欧阳予倩
    胡风反对作家掌握共产主义世界观；反对作家和工农兵相结合；反对作家进行思想改造；反对民族形式；反对文艺为当前的政治任务服务；主张解散文艺界统一组织，取消党的领导。像他这样，说他不是反党是没有谁能相信的。
    胡风有他所组织的小集团，并且披上马克思主义的外衣，打起进步的旗帜，以种种方法，运用他那小集团，一贯地、有计划地同党的文艺思想、党的文艺政策、党对文艺界的组织领导作对；非但如此，他既搞出一套他的文艺纲领，又订出一套战略战术，指示他的小集团成员采取坚决猛烈的行动来反对革命的文艺事业，这还能说不是有意识的反党！
    胡风的反党不仅是一般的坚持思想错误，并且是把马克思主义和党的领导作为他“主观战斗”的对象，而进行恶劣的破坏。可是他在“我的自我批判”一文中，还要轻描淡写地说他的错误根源只是：
  “把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场，混淆了它们中间的原则的区别。”这不仍然是欺骗吗？胡风还想用一套断章取义的马克思主义理论为自己辩护，作战略的退却，这是不行的！请看舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”吧！胡风简直就把党在文艺工作方面的领导同志和团结在党的周围的许多进步作家当成仇敌，任意加以恶毒的咒诅和谩骂；他用“集束手榴弹的战术”来对付革命文艺战线，对进步作家放出了无数阴狠的毒箭，肆意中伤；甚至于想用日本特务对待小林多喜二和国民党匪特对待革命分子的橡皮鞭子来对付他们，认为“如果对他们发生了一丝的希望，那就是自己污辱了自己”，所以只能“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”。从所发表的许多封信来看，显然他是一贯地把中国共产党当成敌人，他甚至说，对他的敌人“……也只有迎上去，而且非抱着与阵地共存亡的决心不可”。
    极端疯狂的资产阶级个人主义和极端顽固的资产阶级唯心主义是胡风的思想基础，但是胡风的一切行动，已经超过了思想问题的范围，它的危害性无论从那方面看都是很大的，不仅是在文艺界。对胡风的反党思想和行动非彻底加以清算不可。
