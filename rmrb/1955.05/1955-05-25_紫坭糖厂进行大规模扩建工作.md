Zini Sugar Factory Undertakes Large-Scale Expansion

　　Guangdong Province's state-owned Zini Sugar Factory began a large-scale expansion project this May, with an expansion investment equivalent to 76 percent of the factory's entire initial investment. By the end of 1956, after the completion of the expansion project, this factory will become the largest sugarcane factory among existing sugar factories in South China. The factory area will increase by 55 percent compared to the existing factory buildings. The crushing capacity will increase from the original design of 1,000 tons per day to 2,100 tons, and it will be able to produce more than 10,000 metric tons of white sugar for the country each year.

　　The entire design work for the factory's expansion project is being undertaken by the Design and Engineering Company of the Sugar and Wine Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry. Currently, various technical design works are being actively carried out. Various materials required for construction and installation engineering have been continuously transported to the construction site to meet the needs of construction. The main items of the expansion project include increasing crushing equipment such as crushing rollers and steam engines, increasing refining and clarifying equipment such as evaporation kettles, sugar boiling kettles, and vacuum filters, as well as increasing power equipment such as boilers and turbine machines.

　　紫坭糖厂进行大规模扩建工作
    广东省的国营紫坭糖厂今年五月起进行大规模的扩建工作，扩建投资相当于这个厂建厂时全部投资的百分之七十六。一九五六年底，扩建工程完成后，这个厂将成为华南现有糖厂中最大的蔗糖厂，厂房的面积将比现有厂房增大百分之五十五；压榨量将由原设计每日一千吨增加到二千一百吨，每年可为国家多生产白砂糖一万公吨以上。
    这个厂扩建工程的全部设计工作都由轻工业部糖酒工业管理局设计工程公司负责。目前，各项技术设计工作正在积极进行。建筑和安装工程所需要的各种材料已经源源运到工地，供应施工的需要。扩建工程的主要项目包括增加压榨辘、蒸汽机等压榨设备，增加蒸发甑、煮糖甑、真空吸滤机等制炼、澄清设备，以及增加锅炉、透平机等动力设备。
