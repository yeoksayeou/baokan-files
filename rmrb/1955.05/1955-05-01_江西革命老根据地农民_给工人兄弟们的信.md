From farmers in the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi:

To the Editorial Department, forwarding to our worker comrades:

We are representatives from twenty-three agricultural production cooperatives in the first district (mountainous area) of Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, an old revolutionary base area. As we celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day, we are most pleased to share our production situation with you: This year is the third year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan. We deeply understand that fulfilling and overfulfilling agricultural production increase tasks according to national needs is of great significance to the completion of the entire Five-Year Plan and to the country's socialist construction. Therefore, our twenty-plus cooperatives carried out rectification work from late March to mid-April, combined with spring plowing. By April 20th, we had completed the spring sowing of 6,590 mu ahead of schedule, and we had also completed the task of converting 777.9 mu from single-crop to double-crop, 113.6 mu from late rice to early rice, and 172.6 mu from dry land to paddy field, exceeding the original plan by 25.1 percent. In this way, we expect to increase rice production by 265,446 catties this year. We guarantee not to be complacent, and we are currently working hard to realize the plan of cultivating one more time than in 1954 and applying two to three more dan of green manure per mu than in 1954!

Worker comrades, our area suffered from mountain floods in 1954, and some crops experienced reduced production and poor harvests. To overcome the spring and summer famine, we are using methods such as planting early-maturing crops and organizing sideline production to solve our own difficulties.

We resolutely support the "Three Fixes" policy for grain. In order to support industrial construction and liberate Taiwan, according to statistics from our nineteen cooperatives, we have signed contracts with the national grain department to sell 784,466 catties of rice. As long as the weather is normal, we guarantee to act in accordance with the contract and strive to exceed the contracted amount and sell grain to the state.

We wish you good health!

Representatives from the twenty-three agricultural production cooperatives in the first district of Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province

    江西革命老根据地农民
    给工人兄弟们的信编辑同志转工人兄弟们：
    我们是革命老根据地——江西省弋阳县第一区（山区）二十三个农业生产合作社的代表。在庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我们以最愉快的心情把我们的生产情况告诉你们：今年是祖国第一个五年计划的第三年。我们深刻地认识到按照国家需要来完成并超额完成农业增产任务，对整个五年计划的完成，对国家社会主义建设都有极重大的意义。所以，我们二十多个社在三月下旬到四月中旬，结合春耕生产进行了整顿工作。四月二十日我们就已提前完成了六千五百九十亩的春耕播种任务，并且完成了把一季作物改为二季作物七百七十七亩九分、晚禾改早禾一百一十三亩六分、旱地改水田一百七十二亩六分的任务，超过了原计划百分之二十五点一。这样，今年预计可增产稻谷二十六万五千四百四十六斤。我们保证不骄傲，目前正为实现普遍比一九五四年多耘一次，每亩比一九五四年多施两担到三担青草肥的计划而紧张地劳动着！
    工人同志们，我们这里一九五四年受到山洪侵袭，部分作物减产歉收。为了战胜春夏荒，我们正用种好早熟作物和组织副业生产等办法来解决自己的困难。
    我们坚决拥护粮食“三定”政策。为了支援工业建设，支援解放台湾，据我们十九个社统计，就与国家粮食部门签订了七十八万四千四百六十六斤稻谷的定购合同，只要年景正常，我们保证按合同办事，并争取超过定购合同，把粮食卖给国家。
　　祝你们身体健康！
