Xinhua News Agency, Lushun, 11th. When a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army took over the defense of the Lushunkou area, they were warmly welcomed by the Soviet troops who were about to withdraw back to their country, and they established a close friendship in a very short period of time.

Before the People's Liberation Army troops taking over the defense of the Lushunkou area arrived, the Soviet troops stationed there cleaned up the barracks and gave the comfortable and tidy barracks to the PLA troops to live in. When the PLA troops were about to arrive, Soviet officers and soldiers rushed out to greet them several miles away. They shook hands warmly when they met. The Soviet soldiers rushed to carry luggage for the PLA soldiers. After arriving at the garrison, the Soviet army held a warm welcome party for the PLA soldiers.

During the days they spent together, the Soviet officers and soldiers gave the PLA soldiers meticulous care. Once, a Soviet lieutenant colonel went to the barracks several times late at night to cover the sleeping Chinese soldiers with quilts. When this Soviet officer saw the mercury column of the thermometer in the barracks dropping, he hurriedly lit the fireplace to raise the indoor temperature. Chinese soldiers who had just arrived at the barracks were invited by the Soviet soldiers to take a bath. They took the shirts that the Chinese soldiers had taken off while bathing, washed them clean, and then sent them back. When the PLA troops first arrived in the Lushunkou area, some of them temporarily ate in the Soviet army canteen. The Soviet officers and soldiers warmly entertained them, as if they were treating family members.

Although the time the Chinese and Soviet soldiers spent together was short, they had already established a deep friendship between them. As the day for the Soviet troops to return home approached, the Chinese and Soviet soldiers gave each other their most beloved things as permanent keepsakes. At a rally to send off the Soviet troops returning home, Soviet soldier Bieda put his beloved "Ready for Labor and Defense" medal on the chest of Chinese soldier Yuan Guanghua, and said, "I give it to you, I hope you will exercise better and serve the motherland." Yuan Guanghua also gave one of his commemorative medals to Bieda and hung it on his chest.

　　苏军热烈欢迎接防旅顺口地区的我解放军
    新华社旅大十一日电　中国人民解放军某部在接管旅顺口地区的防务时，受到即将撤退回国的苏联军队的热烈欢迎，他们在很短的时间内建立了亲密的友谊。
    驻旅顺口地区的苏军在接防的人民解放军部队还没有到达以前，便把营房打扫干净，把舒适整洁的营房让给解放军部队住。当解放军部队快到达的时候，苏军官兵们赶到好几里路以外去迎接。他们会面时互相热情地握手。苏军抢着给解放军战士背行囊。到了驻地后，苏军又为解放军战士举行了热情的欢迎会。
    在一起相处的日子里，苏军官兵们给予人民解放军战士以无微不至的关怀。有一次，一位苏军中校深夜好几次到营房里给睡熟了的中国战士盖被子。这位苏军军官看到营房里的寒暑表水银柱下降时，便急忙烧起壁炉，提高室内的温度。到达营房不久的中国战士，都被苏军战士请去洗澡。他们把中国战士在洗澡时换下的衬衣拿去，洗得干干净净后再送回来。解放军部队刚到旅顺口地区时，有的暂时在苏军食堂里吃饭，苏军官兵们热情地招待他们，好似对待家人一样的亲切。
    中苏战士相处的时间虽然短促，他们之间已经建立了深厚的友谊。苏军回国的日子临近了，中苏战士们互相赠送自己最心爱的东西留作永久的纪念。在一个欢送苏军回国的大会上，苏军士兵别佳把自己心爱的“劳卫制”奖章给中国战士袁光华佩在胸前，他说：“我把它送给你，愿你更好地锻炼身体，为祖国服务。”袁光华也把自己的一枚纪念章给别佳挂在胸前。
