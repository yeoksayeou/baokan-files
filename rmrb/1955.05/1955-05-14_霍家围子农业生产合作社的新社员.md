New Members of the Huo Jia Weizi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
　　Dai Yue, Fang Qing
　　Huo Jia Weizi is a natural village belonging to the Da Yushu administrative village in Zhaodong County. On the afternoon of May 8th, the director of the agricultural producers' cooperative of this village, Qi Fangming, led reporters to see the home of a new cooperative member. At this time, three children were playing on the kang (a heated brick bed), a twelve-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy each grabbed one of Director Qi's arms, shouting, "Director, Director!" and pulling him onto the kang. After the director sat down, a child of just over one year old also tried to climb onto the director. After this commotion, the director asked the girl:
　　"Where's your dad?" The director clearly knew he was working in the fields.
　　"He's working in the fields!" the girl replied in a strong Shandong accent.
　　"Where's your mom?"
　　"She's planting sugar beets in the cooperative." the two children answered eagerly.
　　"Is the kang warm?" the reporter asked.
　　"Feel it, it's burning hot!" the two children said, pulling our hands.
　　This was the home of a cooperative member who had only joined three days earlier. The owner is called Liu Xiaode, who had moved to Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province from Liangshan County, Shandong, four thousand li (approximately 1,243 miles) away, only four days earlier. On May 4th, when they arrived at Shangjia Station, it was raining, but the district cadres had mobilized some people to help them move their belongings and carry the children. After eating at the district, the rain stopped, and the agricultural producers' cooperative's carts took them back. Before even entering the house, they saw the window paper pasted on the windows, the neat stoves and cauldrons in the outer room, and the water tanks filled with water. Firewood was piled on the ground; upon entering the inner room, the kang was covered with new mats and the kang was heated. When they felt around, there was millet in the pockets. All of this was solved with the help of the agricultural producers' cooperative. Before long, people from the cooperative arrived. Director Qi was the first to bring two braids of dried zucchini strips and a basket of potatoes; Yin Dianyuan and Li Cai both brought sauerkraut, pickles, and soybean paste; Zhang Deren inspected the house and, seeing that there was still a lack of pot lids and rice spoons, immediately took them from his own home and put them on the stove... The old cooperative members put down their things and sat down in the house, greeting them warmly, just like relatives who had been separated for a long time.
　　Da Yushu village received a total of five immigrant households, including Liu Xiaode and Liu Wendian, which were allocated according to the existing five agricultural producers' cooperatives. When they arrived in the village, they were welcomed like Liu Xiaode.
　　The local farmers took care of the immigrants meticulously. As soon as they put down their luggage, they were considered members of the agricultural producers' cooperative, enjoying the same treatment and rights as the old members, and receiving the same amount of vegetable plots, seven fen (approximately 0.17 acres) per person. Moreover, the land was already filled with manure, and potato seedlings and various vegetable seeds were prepared. At this time, the cooperative had already begun spring sowing, and they did not have to worry about land, carts, farm implements, fertilizers, or seeds. Liu Wendian said gratefully: "In the past, Shandong people also came to the Great Northern Wilderness, but they all worked for others. There was land here, but where did the carts and farm implements come from! In the end, for generations, we worked for the landlords and could never turn ourselves around; now you see, as soon as we enter, we've arrived home, and everything is complete." As he spoke, tears of gratitude welled up in his eyes.
　　The reporter found Liu Xiaode's wife in the sugar beet field, she was a very robust middle-aged woman. It was the first time in her life that she had seen such vast land, and she couldn't contain her inner joy while still on the train. Upon inquiring at the cooperative, she learned that the average person had nearly one qing (approximately 16.5 acres) of land, seven or eight times more than in her hometown, which made her heart blossom even more. She said: "The state takes such good care of us, we must produce well."

　　霍家围子农业生产合作社的新社员
　　戴月　方青
    霍家围子是属于肇东县大榆树行政村的一个自然屯。五月八日的下午，这个屯子的农业生产合作社主任齐芳明，带领记者去看一个新社员的家。这时，三个孩子正在炕上玩，十二岁的女孩和九岁的男孩一人扯住齐主任的一只胳膊，嘴里喊着：“主任，主任！”就往炕上拉。主任坐下以后，一个一岁多的孩子也用力往主任身上爬。闹了这么一阵，主任才问女孩：
    “你爹呢？”主任分明知道他正在地里生产。
    “下地干活啦！”女孩用浓重的山东口音答复。
    “你妈呢？”
    “在社里种甜菜呢。”两个孩子争着回答。
    “炕热吗？”记者问。
    “你摸摸，热的烫手！”两个孩子说着就来拉我们的手。
    这是一个三天以前才入社的社员之家，主人叫刘孝德，四天以前才从四千里以外的山东梁山县搬到黑龙江省的肇东县来。五月四日，他们到达尚家车站时，正赶上下雨，但是区干部已动员了一些人来替他们搬东西、抱孩子。在区上吃了饭，雨也停了，农业生产合作社的大车便把他们接了回去。还没有进屋，就看到窗户上所糊的窗纸，外屋是整齐的锅灶、缸里都给挑满了水，地上堆着烧柴；一进里屋，炕上铺着新席，烧的滚热的炕，一摸，口袋里还有小米。这都是农业生产合作社帮助解决的。不大一会儿，社里人们都来了，齐主任首先拿来两辫西葫芦条（干菜）和一筐子土豆；尹殿元和李才都送来酸菜、咸菜、大酱；张德仁在屋里巡视了一下，看到还缺锅盖和饭勺子，马上从自己家里拿来，放到锅台上……老社员们放下东西，就坐到屋里热情地问候起来，就和久别重逢的亲人一样。
    大榆树村总共接收了刘孝德、刘文殿等五户移民，这是按照现有的五个农业生产合作社分配的。他们到了村里，都像刘孝德那样受到人们的欢迎。
    当地农民对移民的照顾是无微不至的，他们一放下行李，就算成了农业生产合作社的社员，和老社员享受同等待遇和权利，得到了同等数量的每人七分菜地，而且地里已上满了粪，备妥了土豆栽子和各种菜籽。这时，社里已经开始春播，土地、车马、农具、肥料、籽种都不用他们操心。刘文殿感激地说：“往年，咱山东人也到北大荒来过，那都是给人家扛活。这里地倒有，可是哪来的车马农具呀！到头来，一连几辈子给地主扛活，永也翻不过身来；现在你看，一进门就算到了家，什么都是齐全的。”说着，眼里竟涌出了感激的泪花。
    记者在种甜菜的地里找到了刘孝德的老婆，她是个非常健壮的中年妇女。她生平第一次看到这么辽阔的土地，还在火车上就已经按不住内心的喜悦了。到社一打听，平均每一个人将近一垧地，比她的家乡多七、八倍，越发使她的心花开放。她说：“国家照顾得这么好，我们一定要好好地生产。”
