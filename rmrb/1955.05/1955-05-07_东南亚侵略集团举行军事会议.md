　　Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Manila dispatch: The military representatives of the Manila Treaty Organization countries, led by the United States, concluded a secret meeting in Baguio, Philippines, on the 5th.

　　According to Western news agencies, the secret meeting, which lasted ten days, has drafted a secret military plan. This secret plan will be submitted to the meeting of military advisors from the Manila Treaty Organization countries, scheduled to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on June 6, for approval.

　　Sources say that the main content of this secret plan, orchestrated under the auspices of the United States, is to establish the so-called "mobile strike force" of the Manila Treaty Organization as a tool for American aggression and enslavement of Asia. The plan stipulates that "immediate steps should be taken to establish a ground force for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." In accordance with the United States' policy of "Asians fighting Asians," the task of providing cannon fodder for this ground force will mainly be borne by Asian countries within the Manila Treaty Organization. It is revealed that the majority of the ground forces will be provided by the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan. Australia and New Zealand may also provide a portion of the ground forces. The United States will be responsible for funding and equipping this force. The plan also stipulates the establishment of a mobile naval and air force. The United States, Britain, and France will provide most of the naval and air power, while other smaller countries must establish more naval and air bases on their territories for the use of these countries' naval and air power, especially the United States'.

　　The plan stipulates the "establishment of a joint military staff headquarters for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's combat forces" to uniformly plan aggressive deployments in Asia. The plan also stipulates the establishment of intelligence centers to uniformly arrange subversive sabotage activities and the collection of military and economic intelligence in Southeast Asian countries.

　　Sources reveal that this plan also stipulates "urgent consideration" of the so-called "defense needs" of South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, that is, to intensify the planning for further intervention in the internal affairs of Indochina and Thailand, and to undermine the Geneva Accords on Indochina.

　　In order to force other countries to follow its adventurous plan, the United States exerted enormous pressure on these countries at this meeting, forcing them to submit to the will of the United States. However, information revealed from the secret meeting indicates that some Asian countries have shown some degree of concern about unconditionally accepting this dangerous plan of the United States and acting as cannon fodder for the United States to launch new aggression in Asia. United Press International reporters in a dispatch from Baguio stated that the head of the Thai delegation attending the meeting, Charusreni, expressed his disapproval at the May 1st meeting of the plan to station Manila Treaty Organization troops on Thai territory, saying, "Thailand does not need any foreign troops stationed on its territory." Philippine Senator Laurel also expressed opposition on May 1st to sending Philippine troops to any treaty area. This UPI reporter said that these opinions from Thai and Philippine figures "poured a bucket of cold water" on the meeting.

### 东南亚侵略集团举行军事会议

　　东南亚侵略集团举行军事会议
    新华社五日讯　马尼拉消息：以美国为首的马尼拉条约组织国家的军事代表在菲律宾的碧瑶举行的秘密会议已经在五日结束。
    据西方通讯社透露，这次历时十天的秘密会议已拟定了一项秘密的军事计划。这项秘密计划将交给预定在六月六日在泰国的曼谷召开的马尼拉条约组织国家军事顾问的会议批准。
    消息说，这项在美国主持下策划的秘密计划的主要内容是要建立马尼拉条约组织的所谓“机动攻击部队”，作为美国侵略和奴役亚洲的工具。计划规定，“立即采取步骤为东南亚条约组织建立一支地面部队”。根据美国的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，为这支地面部队提供炮灰的任务主要将由马尼拉条约组织中的亚洲国家来担负。据透露，大多数的地面部队将由菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦提供。澳大利亚和新西兰也可能提供一部分地面部队。而美国则负责资助和装备这支部队。计划还规定要建立一支机动的海空军部队。美国、英国和法国将提供大部分的海空军力量，而其他较小国家则必须在自己的领土上建立更多的海空军基地，供这些国家，特别是美国的海空军力量使用。
    计划规定要“建立东南亚条约组织作战部队的联合军事参谋部”，来统一规划在亚洲的侵略部署。计划还规定要建立情报中心，以统一布置在东南亚各国内的颠覆破坏活动和搜集军事经济情报的活动。
    消息透露，这个计划还规定要“紧急考虑”南越、柬埔寨、老挝和泰国的所谓“防御需要”，也就是说，要加紧策划进一步干涉印度支那和泰国的内政，破坏日内瓦会议关于印度支那的协议。
    为了迫使其他国家追随它的这个冒险计划，美国在这次会议上对这些国家施加了巨大的压力，要它们屈从美国的意志。但是，从秘密会议中透露出来的消息说明，某些亚洲国家对于毫无保留地接受美国的这种危险计划，为美国在亚洲发动新的侵略充当炮灰，还是表现了某种程度的顾虑。合众社记者在发自碧瑶的消息中说，出席这次会议的泰国代表团团长查鲁斯伦尼在五月一日会议上曾表示不赞成把马尼拉条约组织军队驻在泰国的领土上的打算，他说，“泰国不需要任何外国军队驻在它的领土上”。菲律宾参议员劳雷尔也在五月一日表示反对把菲律宾军队派到任何条约地区去。合众社这个记者说，泰国和菲律宾人士的这些意见给会议“泼了一桶冷水”。
