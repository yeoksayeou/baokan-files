Haiphong's Rebirth
By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

The Vietnamese people will forever remember May 13, 1955. On this day, in the afternoon, the French tricolor flag, which had been flying forlornly on the flagpole at the Haiphong port wharf, was lowered, and the last French warship sailed out of the "Forbidden Gate." The decades of colonial rule by French imperialism in Haiphong and North Vietnam came to an end forever. Haiphong was completely liberated. The bright and splendid red flag with a gold star, flying high above the wharf, waving in the sea breeze, brought to mind so many past events!

Many years ago, when Haiphong had just formed from the land, and the surrounding area was still full of sea trees that rose and fell with the tide, the diligent Vietnamese people fished and dried salt here, and gradually built dikes and dams, filled ditches and opened canals, cultivated fields, and established villages and towns. At that time, Haiphong was called "Forbidden Village," and the port was called "Forbidden Gate." Even today, the port of Haiphong still uses this old name.

In 1872, the first French colonial warship invaded North Vietnam, occupied Haiphong, and established its base for plundering North Vietnam here.

The colonialists used guns and cannons to force the Vietnamese people to build a series of wharves, warehouses, gasoline depots, and a power plant along the south bank of the "Forbidden Gate" River; at the same time, they built large and small buildings nearby, arranging their "Governor's Office," officers' residences, barracks, detective buildings, customs, banks, and hospitals inside. Subsequently, the French colonialists opened various processing factories, repair factories, bottling factories, silk factories, and a Haiphong cement factory with a monthly output of 20,000 tons at both ends of the so-called "French Quarter," as close as possible to the seaport, to plunder raw materials and exploit cheap labor nearby, manufacturing finished or semi-finished products for sale in Indochina and other Eastern countries, earning high profits.

Next to the so-called "French Quarter" and "Central Quarter" appeared various import and export trading houses, high-end luxury goods stores, theaters, hotels, bars, and brothels, etc., for the extravagant colonialists to enjoy themselves; further south and to the southeast and southwest, were the commercial areas of the Vietnamese and overseas Chinese, as well as the places where workers and laborers lived. On the Tam Bac River and the Đuống River in the city were urban poor people living on the water. The layout of the entire city of Haiphong resembled a crescent shape, with a population of approximately 230,000.

The construction and development of Haiphong consumed the blood and sweat of the Vietnamese working people; it also recorded the colonialists' bloody debts of plunder and exploitation of the Vietnamese people. Before the war, three to four hundred ships entered and left the port every year. Each ship carried away a batch of agricultural products or industrial raw materials diligently produced by the Vietnamese people, and brought in colonial goods that sucked the marrow of the Vietnamese people.

In the August Revolution of 1945, the people of Haiphong, like the people in other parts of Vietnam, seized power from the Japanese fascists and lived an independent and free life, but soon, in the winter of 1946, the French colonial army, with the support of American imperialism, invaded North Vietnam again, first occupying Haiphong, and the people here returned to a dark life.

However, the workers and people of Haiphong, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have never stopped their struggle against aggression over the years. Many outstanding sons and daughters of the Vietnamese people living in Haiphong—Vietnamese Labor Party members and non-Party members—sacrificed their lives for the cause of peace and independence of their motherland. The Haiphong workers, in coordination with the People's Army, created a major victory at the Cat Bi Airport, destroying sixty American-made French aircraft, powerfully supporting the Dien Bien Phu campaign.

The Geneva Conference signed the armistice agreement, and Haiphong and its surrounding areas were designated as the last temporary stationing area for the French army in North Vietnam, for a period of three hundred days. Under the massive armed oppression of the colonialists, the people of Haiphong still persisted in their struggle, opposing the destruction of factories and seaports, opposing the dismantling and transportation of machinery and other public property, and opposing the forced relocation of residents to the south. Especially near the time of liberation, the momentum of the struggle became more and more massive. As long as one household was being forcibly relocated, all the nearby households would come out to support them. They used the sound of banging washbasins, porcelain jars, bowls, and plates as warning signals to echo each other. The French colonial army and the American stooge Ngo Dinh Diem's army were often forced to stop. From May 4th, more than 20,000 people in the city surrounded the bottling factory for four days and four nights, finally forcing the French army and the Ngo Dinh Diem elements to release all 320 residents who were imprisoned there, preparing to be forcibly relocated to South Vietnam.

On the night before liberation, the workers of the Haiphong power plant, the water company, and many other large and small factories, even the workers of the Haiphong cement factory who had been laid off for a long time, resolutely stayed in the factories overnight, guarding the factories and machinery, preventing the French army and the Ngo Dinh Diem elements from carrying out further destruction.

On May 12th, the northwestern part of Haiphong—the Hạ Lý area—was the first to be liberated. When the red flag with a gold star, longed for for many years, rose above the oil tanks and factory buildings of the gasoline company and the cement factory, the joy of the Haiphong people was difficult to describe. Many people living on the east side of the Hạ Lý Bridge secretly bypassed the French army's temporary cordon to cross the river and shake hands with the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers and the staff of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government, enjoying the joy of liberation as early as possible. That night, the already liberated area on the west side of the bridge, illuminated by brilliant electric lights, was a sea of flags and songs and dances, while the east side of the bridge was as silent as death. In the deeply locked residences, shops, or cabins, people had already hung up the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and portraits of leaders. Young people secretly gathered in houses to learn liberation songs and dances, with one or two children on guard at the gate. Many families stayed up all night as if they were guarding the New Year.

The final moment finally arrived. When the sky was faintly bright on May 13th, the large trucks of the vanguard of the Vietnamese People's Army drove across the Hạ Lý Bridge, entered the commercial area, entered the area where the working people lived, took over the water company, the power plant, the shipping factory, the French barracks, and the Cat Bi Airport, and finally took over the entire "French Quarter" and the entire seaport. The French rearguard retreated backwards for a while, and all the doors and windows in that section opened as if a gust of wind had blown through them; in the blink of an eye, countless red flags with gold stars, red flags with five stars, and peace flags with white doves on a blue background were hung all over the streets. At the intersections, elaborately crafted colorful arches were quickly erected.

On the day of liberation, the chimneys of the power plant continuously emitted black smoke, and people could use electricity at any time from morning to night; the water company increased the water supply time from four hours to six hours; postal, telecommunications, and telephone services were unblocked, and on the first day, the post office delivered more than 500 letters to people of all walks of life in Haiphong; the currency exchange rate was quickly announced, and most shops opened for business. At night, the Grand Theatre, Garden Street, Tokyo Street, and other bustling areas were brightly lit, illuminating the joyful crowds. Thirteen cinemas in the city screened films such as "Vietnam in the Anti-War Struggle," attracting a large number of viewers. …

The peaceful and free life of the people of Haiphong has begun again.

On the night of the 13th, not a single shot was heard in Haiphong, and the people of Haiphong, who had lived in terror and unease for a long time, had a good night's sleep for the first time. The next morning, people went to participate in the parade of the People's Army entering the city with excitement.

In the afternoon, the first direct train from Hanoi arrived in Haiphong, with thirty carriages full of more than 3,000 passengers. Most of them were people who had fled to avoid the enemy's forced relocation to the south in the past, and now they were returning to their old homes in Haiphong with their families. There were also some industrialists and merchants from Hanoi and other places, bringing the first batch of goods and local products and specialties from the interior. There was also a cultural troupe, which had come specially from the capital to perform for the people of Haiphong. According to statistics, from the 15th to the 21st, there were 25,140 passengers getting on and off at the Haiphong station in seven days; freight transport between the two places has also begun and is gradually increasing.

In the first three days of liberation, the port management personnel of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government had already completed the comprehensive inspection of the Haiphong port, wharves, pontoons, waterways, buoys, lighthouses, and warehouses, quickly opened the inland waterway, and on the 20th, for the first time, welcomed two heavy-tonnage ships from South Vietnam, carrying 2,012 Vietnamese people and overseas Chinese who had been forcibly relocated to the south and firmly demanded to return to North Vietnam. Now, the mast of the Haiphong port command building is hanging the flag indicating the wind direction, and the "Forbidden Gate" and other lighthouses begin to illuminate every evening, helping ships to navigate. In front of the Customs Administration gate, the new import and export regulations have been announced. Some Vietnamese overseas Chinese and other foreign merchants have come to inquire or go through the procedures.

With the rapid restoration of peaceful life, prices in Haiphong have gradually stabilized, especially the prices of daily necessities for urban residents such as rice, vegetables, fish, and meat, which have remained stable. This is inseparable from the correct new district policies and urban policies of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh. Long ago, the government of the Democratic Republic had prepared sufficient supplies to meet the needs of Haiphong, and in order to effectively guarantee the supply of food and other daily necessities to the broad masses of workers and laborers in the city, the democratic government organized more than 3,000 cadres and soldiers as soon as the city was liberated to help the masses fill out registration certificates for purchasing food, etc., and the state-owned trading company opened ten retail outlets for grain, mountain products, and general merchandise in the city, supplying rice and other daily necessities to the people at low prices.

Like many coastal cities, the supply of drinking water in Haiphong is a very serious problem. The city's water is supplied from Ông Bì, dozens of kilometers away, through two water pipes. One water pipe was bombed by American planes in 1945 and has never been repaired, and the middle section of the other water pipe has also been damaged, and the water supply is very small. Before liberation, less than 5,000 cubic meters of fresh water were transported into the city every day, of which five-sixths were occupied by the French colonialists, and the remaining one-sixth was mixed with a large amount of seawater and then supplied to the broad masses of people in the city, only open for four hours a day. In order to gradually solve the problem of drinking water in Haiphong, to protect the health of the people and to meet the needs of restoring and developing the city's industry and commerce, the Democratic Republic government started work on repairing the damaged parts of the existing water pipes in the newly taken-over areas as early as April this year. It was completed on May 19th and a large amount of fresh water was supplied to Haiphong. The water supply increased by 40% compared with before liberation. The opening time of each water pipe in the city was extended by two hours every day. In particular, the water supply situation in the areas where the laboring people are concentrated, such as Bát Gian Street and Hàng Kênh Street, has been greatly improved compared with before liberation, and has been universally praised by the people.

Haiphong has been liberated for ten days, and it is still filled with a festive atmosphere. Countless large and small red flags, and the clusters of red flowers that are in full bloom on the phoenix trees all over the streets and lanes, make the whole city glow red. Amidst the joy, the people of Haiphong are using new labor enthusiasm to engage in restoration and construction work. The workers are stepping up production. In one factory, when the colonialists wanted to take away the machines before liberation, the workers secretly removed the main parts of the machines and hid them. As soon as the colonialists withdrew, they took out these parts and installed them, and the machines quickly started running. In the same factory, the workers automatically handed over to the public three electric water meters and fifty car tires that they had hidden before liberation. In the power plant, there are two diesel generators. In the past, the maximum power generation of each unit could only reach 800 kilowatts per day, but now each unit has reached 1,000 kilowatts per day.

The primary and secondary schools that were forced to close before liberation have resumed classes. Tens of thousands of tons of garbage left in the city during the colonial rule are being cleared, and the city has taken on a new look. As Văn Bích, vice chairman of the Haiphong Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic, we can not only manage the countryside, but also manage the people's cities well. These words do not need any explanation, they are the best summary since the liberation of Haiphong.

　　海防的新生
　　本报驻越南记者　展潮
    越南人民永远记得一九五五年五月十三日这个日子。这一天下午，一面孤悬在海防港口码头旗杆上的法国三色旗降下了，最后一艘法国军舰开出了“禁门”口外。法帝国主义在海防以及北越几十年的殖民统治，从此永远告终。海防全部解放了。那面高高地升起在码头上空、迎着海风招展的光辉灿烂底金星红旗，使人想起了多少的往事啊！
    很多年代以前，当海防刚形成陆地、四处还长满可以随潮水涨落的海树的时候，勤劳的越南人民就在这里捕鱼、晒盐，并且逐渐在周围修堤筑坝，填沟开渠，垦殖田园，建立起一座座村落和市镇。那时候，海防叫“禁村”，港口叫“禁门”。直到今天海防港口仍然沿用着这个旧名。
    一八七二年法国殖民者头一艘战船侵入北越，占领了海防，并且在这里建立它掠夺北越的大本营。
    殖民者用枪炮逼迫越南人民沿着“禁门”江南岸修建了一系列的码头、仓库、汽油库和一个发电厂；同时，又在附近修筑起一幢幢大大小小的楼房，在里面安排下它的“统署处”、军官住宅、兵营、侦探楼、海关、银行和医院。随后，法国殖民者又在这个“法国区”两端、尽量靠近海港的地方，开设了各种加工工厂、修理工厂、制瓶工厂、蚕丝工厂以及一个月产二万吨水泥的海防水泥工厂，就近掠夺原料和榨取廉价的劳动力，制造成品或半成品，在印度支那和东方各国销售，赢取高额利润。
    在所谓“法国区”、“中央区”旁边，出现了各色出入口商行、高级奢侈品商店、戏院、旅馆、酒店和妓院等等，供穷奢极欲的殖民者玩乐；再向南以及东南和西南两侧，是越南人和华侨的商业区以及工人和劳动人民聚居的地方。在市区里的三泊河和搭河上是居住水上的城市贫民。整个海防市的布局仿佛是一个半月形，居民约有二十三万人。
    海防市的兴建和发展过程，不知耗费了越南劳动人民多少血汗；同时也记载下了殖民者掠夺和榨取越南人民的斑斑血债。战前每年进出港口的轮船达三、四百艘。每一艘船都要括走一批越南人民辛勤生产的农产品或工业原料，运进来的是吸取越南人民膏脂的殖民国家商品。
    一九四五年八月革命，海防人民也和越南其他地方的人民一样，从日本法西斯手里夺取了政权，过着独立自由的生活，可是不久，一九四六年冬，法国殖民者的军队又在美帝国主义的支持下侵略北越，首先占领了海防市，这里的人民又重新过着黑暗的日子。
    但是，有着光荣的革命传统的海防工人和人民，这些年从来没有停止过反侵略的斗争。居住在海防的许多越南人民优秀的儿女——越南劳动党员和非党员群众，在为祖国的和平、独立的事业中献出了自己的生命。海防工人曾经和人民军配合在吉碑飞机场创造了一次炸毁美造法机六十架的重大战绩，有力地配合了奠边府战役。
    日内瓦会议签订了停战协定，海防以及它周围地区被划作法国军队在北越最后一个临时驻扎地段，为期三百天。在殖民者大量武装压迫的情况下，海防人民依然坚持着斗争，反对破坏工厂、海港，反对拆运机器以及其他公共财产，反对强迫居民南迁。特别是临近解放的时候，斗争的声势愈来愈浩大。只要一户人家被劫运，附近所有的人家都出来支援。他们以敲打洗脸盆、磁缸、碗、碟等的声音为警号互相呼应。法国殖民者的军队和美国走狗吴庭艳的军队往往被迫住手。自五月四日起，全市两万多人包围制瓶厂四天四夜，终于迫使法军和吴庭艳分子把监禁在那里准备劫运到南越去的三百二十名居民全部释放出来。
    解放的前一天夜里，海防发电厂、自来水公司和其他许多大小厂的工人，甚至连被解雇已久的海防水泥工厂的工人都坚决留在厂里过夜，守卫着工厂、机器，使法军和吴庭艳分子无法再进行破坏。
    五月十二日，海防西北部分——下里地区首先获得解放，当怀念多年的金星红旗在汽油公司、士敏土工厂的油罐和厂房上空升起来的时候，海防人民那种欢欣鼓舞的心情是很难加以描述的。许多住在下里桥东边的人，偷偷地绕过法军的临时警戒线渡到河对岸去，同越南人民军战士和民主共和国政府的工作人员握手欢聚，尽可能早地享受解放后的喜悦。当天夜里，桥西面已解放的地区，在辉煌的电灯照耀下，是一片旗海和歌舞声，而桥东面却像死也似的沉寂。在重门深锁的住宅、商店或者船舱里面，人们却已经把越南民主共和国国旗和领袖像挂起来了。青年们偷偷地集中在屋子里学习解放的歌曲和舞蹈，大门口由一两位少年儿童在放哨。有许多人家像守岁似的，终夜不眠。
    最后的一刻终于到来了，五月十三日天曚曚亮的时候，越南人民军先头部队的大卡车开过下里桥，进入了商业区，进入了劳动人民聚居的地方，接管了自来水公司、电灯厂、船务厂、法国兵营和吉碑飞机场，最后接管了整个“法国区”和全部海港。法国的后卫部队向后撤退一段，那段里所有的门窗就像刮过一阵风似的全都开开了；眨眼之间，无数面金星红旗、五星红旗和蓝底白鸽的和平旗，挂遍了整条街坊。在交叉路口处，迅速地树立起一座座精心制造成的多彩的大牌楼。
    在解放的当天，电灯厂的烟囱里不断地冒着黑烟，人们从早到晚随时都可以用电；自来水公司把送水的时间自四小时增到六小时；邮政、电讯和电话畅通，头一天邮政所就把五百多封信件送到了海防各阶层人民手里；货币兑换比值很快地就公布了，大部分商店开门营业。入夜，大戏院、花园街、东京街等闹市灯光辉煌，照耀着欢乐的人群。市区十三家电影院里放映“抗战的越南”等片子，吸引着大量的观众。……
    海防人民的和平自由的生活，重新开始了。
    十三日夜里，海防市听不到一声枪响，长期在恐怖和不安中度日的海防人民，第一次睡了个好觉。第二天早晨醒来，人们怀着兴奋的心情去参加了人民军入城部队的阅兵式。
    下午，第一列直达火车自河内开到了海防，三十个车厢满载三千多名乘客。他们大部分是过去逃避敌人强迫南迁的，现在携老带小重返海防故居。还有一部分是河内等地的工商业者，他们带来第一批内地的货物和土产、特产。再就是一队文工团，他们是特地自首都赶来为海防人民演出的。据统计：十五日到二十一日七天中，在海防车站上下的乘客有二万五千一百四十名；两地的货运也已经开始，并且正逐步上升。
    在解放的头三天，越南民主共和国政府海港管理人员就已经完成了对海防港口、码头、浮筒、航道、浮标、灯塔以及仓库的全部检查工作，迅速地开放了内河航道，并且在二十日第一次迎接两艘自南越开来的重吨位轮船，船上载着二千零十二位坚决要求返回北越的曾被劫运南迁的越南人民和华侨。现在，海防港口指挥楼的桅杆上挂着表示风向的旗号，“禁门”等灯塔每天傍晚即开始照明，帮助船只航行。海关署大门前面，公布了新的出入口条例。已经有些越南华侨以及其他外侨商人前来询问或者办理手续了。
    随着和平生活的迅速恢复，海防市的物价已经逐渐趋向稳定，特别是像大米、菜蔬、鱼、肉等城市人民日用必需品的价格，始终都很平稳。这是和越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席正确的新区政策、城市政策分不开的。在很早以前，民主共和国政府就已经准备了充足的物资，以便供应海防市的需要，并且为了切实保证对城市广大工人和劳动人民粮食以及其他日用品的供给，城市刚一解放，民主政府就组织了三千多干部和战士，帮助群众填写购买粮食等的登记证，国营贸易公司并在全市开设了十个粮食、山货和百货门市部，廉价地向人民供应大米以及其他各种日用必需品。
    和许多沿海的城市一样，海防市食用水是一个十分严重的问题。这城市的水，要从几十公里外的翁比用两条输水管来供给，有一条输水管在一九四五年被美国飞机炸断了，始终没有修复，另一条输水管的中部也已损坏，输水量很少。在解放前每日输进市内不到五千立方公尺的淡水，被法国殖民者占去了六分之五，剩下的六分之一掺入大量的海水后再供市内广大人民食用，每天只开放四小时。民主共和国政府为了逐步解决海防食用水，以保障人民的健康和供应恢复与发展城市工商业的需要，早在今年四月间就着手在新接管的地区动工修整现有水管的损坏部分，五月十九日全部竣工并向海防市输送大量淡水。供水量比解放前增加了百分之四十。全市各水管每天开放时间延长两小时。特别是八间街、杭京街等处劳动人民集中的地方，供水情况比解放前大大改善了，受到人民普遍的赞扬。
    海防已经解放十天了，到现在还洋溢着一片节日的景象。数不尽的大大小小的红旗，和满街满巷的凤尾树上开得正旺的团团红花，把整个城市映得通红。在欢乐当中，海防人民正在用新的劳动热情来从事恢复和建设工作。工人们在加紧生产。在某一工厂里，解放前殖民者想劫走机器的时候，工人们偷偷地把机器上主要的零件卸下藏起来，殖民者一撤走，他们就把这些零件拿出来安装上，机器便很快转动了。在同一个工厂里，工人们把解放前藏起来的三个电动测水机、五十个汽车轮胎，自动交给公家。在电力厂里，有两部柴油发电机，过去每部每天最高发电量只能达到八百瓩时，现在每部已达到一千瓩时。
    解放前被迫停课的中小学复课了。殖民者统治时期遗留在城市里的成万吨的垃圾正在被清除着，市容也焕然一新。正如海防市总工会副主席文毕所说的：在胡主席、越南劳动党和民主共和国政府领导下，我们不仅能够管理农村，我们也能够管理好人民的城市。这些话无需乎作任何解释，它是海防解放以来最好的小结了。
