　　Xinhua News Agency, May 6th, New York (TASS dispatch, May 5th): According to newspaper reports, U.S. authorities have forcibly deported John Williamson, one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, from the United States. Williamson was recently released from prison after serving his sentence under the Smith Act.

　　On the eve of being forced to leave the United States, Williamson issued a statement to the press on May 4th, saying: "The reason I am being deported from the United States is the same reason I was sentenced to imprisonment and persecuted in recent years, that is, because I work for the interests of the working class, because I have my own thoughts. My thinking is clear: I believe that the interests of Americans require co-existence, not war; I believe that the McCarthyite reactionaries threaten the freedom of all Americans, and the majority of Americans should unite to restore the 'Bill of Rights' for the benefit of all; I am in favor of socialism. As I leave, I am confident that Americans will be able to restore the democratic traditions they gained in the revolutionary struggle, adapt them to the conditions of the twentieth century, and drive the warmongers away from their midst."

　　After being forcibly deported by U.S. authorities, Williamson decided to go to England.

　　美共领导人威廉逊被美当局强行放逐出国
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社纽约五日讯：据报纸消息，美国当局已把美国共产党领导人之一约翰·威廉逊强行放逐出美国。威廉逊是在服满根据史密斯法所判处的徒刑后最近才从监狱里释放的。
    在被迫离开美国的前夕，威廉逊五月四日向报界代表发表声明说：“我所以被放逐出美国，其原因是和我被处徒刑以及最近几年所受迫害的原因相同的，就是因为我为工人阶级的利益工作，因为我有我自己的思想。我的思想是明确的：我认为，美国人的利益要求共处，而不是战争；我认为，麦卡锡反动派威胁着全体美国人的自由，多数的美国人应当团结起来为全体的利益而恢复‘权利法案’；我赞成社会主义。我在离开的时候，确信美国人一定能够恢复在革命斗争中所获得的民主传统，使它适合于二十世纪的环境，把战争挑拨者从自己的周围赶掉。”
    威廉逊在被美国当局强行放逐后决定前去英国。
