Statement by Spokesperson of the DPRK Ministry of Internal Affairs on the Invasion of the Republic's Territorial Waters by South Korean Armed Vessels

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 18th regarding the incident on May 10th when South Korean armed vessels invaded the Republic's territorial waters near Haeju, Hwanghae Province.

    The statement said that on May 7th, more than one hundred vessels of the Lee Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) gang's armed fleet, disguised as fishing boats or mixed among fishing boats, began operating near Kalsan Island, Hwanghae Province. Initially, they moved between our coastal islands, and then gradually approached the coastline of the Haeju Peninsula, and on May 10th, they even approached to within one or two kilometers of the coastline. Our coast guard repeatedly signaled them to withdraw from our territorial waters and coastal island areas. However, not only did they not withdraw, but they approached our side even more, until our coast guard took self-defense measures, the Lee Seung-man gang's armed fleet retreated towards the direction of Daeyeonpyeong Island.

    The statement pointed out: This incident is a provocative crime committed by the Lee Seung-man gang under the direct cover of the US military in order to oppose the peaceful reunification of our motherland, and the full responsibility lies with the United States and the Lee Seung-man gang.

    The statement emphasized: If the United States and the Lee Seung-man gang dare to carry out provocative acts of invasion, our coast guard will be able to take necessary self-defense measures at any time to ensure that the invaders receive the punishment they deserve.

　　就南朝鲜武装船只侵犯共和国领海事件
　　朝鲜内务省发言人发表声明
    据新华社讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内务省发言人十八日就南朝鲜武装船只在五月十日侵犯黄海南道海州附近的共和国领海事件发表声明。
    声明说，五月七日，李承晚匪帮的武装船队一百多只，伪装成渔船或混入渔船中间，在黄海南道葛岛附近开始活动。起初流动于我沿海岛屿之间，其后逐渐接近海州半岛海岸线，而在五月十日，竟接近到离海岸线一、二公里的地带。我海岸警备队屡次发出信号，要他们从我领海和沿岸岛屿地区退走。但他们不但不退走，反而更加接近我方，直到我海岸警备队采取了自卫措施以后，李承晚匪帮的武装船队才向大延坪岛方向退去。
    声明指出：这个事件，是李承晚匪帮在美国军队的直接掩护下，为反对我们祖国的和平统一而制造的挑衅性罪行，全部责任在于美国和李承晚匪帮。
    声明着重指出：如果美国和李承晚匪帮敢于制造挑衅性的侵犯行动，我们海岸警备队将能够在任何时候采取必要的自卫措施使侵犯者受到应得的回击。
