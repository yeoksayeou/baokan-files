　　Striving to Achieve Higher Quotas
　　Zhang Qingxiang, Labor Model of Jilin Province, Transferred Soldier

　　I was originally a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and now I am a Grade 5 worker on the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

　　To be honest, when the superiors told me to transfer to civilian work, I really couldn't understand it. I was wholeheartedly eager to go to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but I didn't get the chance. When I joined the army, the villagers beat drums and gongs, gave me a horse to ride, and put flowers on me. I myself had said in front of the villagers: "I will not go home until the invaders are defeated." But I didn't even see the faces of the invaders, so how could I go home? Later, I thought: If I'm transferring, then I'm transferring. If I didn't make contributions on the front lines of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, then I'll come to the construction post to contribute my strength!

　　When I arrived at the construction post, the superiors assigned me to learn bricklaying.

　　Bricklaying may seem like there's no mystery to it, but it's not easy to do well. In the beginning, several of us transferred soldiers worked alongside skilled technical workers. But with the same mortar and the same bricks, they worked quickly and well, while we laid bricks slowly and poorly. At that time, the national quota was 1,200 bricks per person per day, but we could only lay 600. I originally planned to make contributions on the construction post, but as a result, I couldn't even meet the production quota. This really made me sad. Strangely enough, in those days when I was learning bricklaying, it rained every day, and I couldn't even practice more in my spare time. Later, we discovered that the reason the workers were fast and we were slow was mainly because we didn't know how to use the trowel. So we moved the bricks and mortar to the dormitory, holding the trowel in one hand and carrying the brick in the other, applying and scraping off the mortar; scraping off and then applying again. After this period of hard study and hard practice, we began to master the bricklaying technique and soon reached a record of laying 1,300 bricks per day.

　　I still remember when I initially broke the national quota, the transferred comrades congratulated me, and the leaders held a meeting to ask me to share my experience. The encouragement of the Party and comrades increased my confidence and courage. So, I concentrated all my energy on bricklaying, just like when I was training in the army. As a result, I created a new record of laying 1,700 bricks per day. Our group also broke the national quota one after another. Because of this achievement, the superiors awarded our group a "Winner" red flag. I attended the meeting of meritorious model representatives convened by the Ministry of Construction Engineering in the spring of 1954.

　　Not long after returning from Beijing, we accepted a task at another workshop. The bricklaying project here was "clear water brickwork," which was different from what we had learned before, and the quota was very high, requiring each person to lay 1,800 bricks per day. At that time, the workers couldn't accept it, and even some old technicians insisted that it couldn't be achieved. But I thought: Since the state has set 1,800 bricks, then it must be achievable. From my own experience, the state has always had a basis for doing things, and it would be even more careful in formulating labor quotas. During the group discussion of the plan, some people advocated setting 1,600 bricks, and some advocated setting 1,700 bricks, but I insisted that it should not be less than 1,800 bricks. I said, "If our plan is lower than the national quota, then what's the point of discussing it!" Because everyone couldn't change their minds for a while, it was decided to experiment first. This experiment was crucial, and for three consecutive days, no one reached the quota, but the wall was getting higher and higher, and the difficulties were getting greater and greater. At this time, the responsible comrade of the work section was very anxious and said to me:

　　"Old Zhang, in the past, no matter what task you accepted, you always overfulfilled it. How come you're falling behind this time?" I felt really sad when I heard this. I thought to myself: I'm someone who wore the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, and when I transferred, I swore to make contributions on the construction post. Could it be that I can't exceed the national quota? That night, I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. I thought about the shortcomings in my work these past few days. Thinking about it, I thought of Wang Qijin. He was also a transferred soldier. When digging earthwork, we worked shoulder to shoulder together, and his group had also made collective contributions. So I found him, told him about the bricklaying situation, and asked him if he could cooperate with us to find a way to improve our work. Wang Qijin was really forthright. He said, "No problem, I guarantee you'll have bricks and mortar to use." Once the coordination problem was solved, the bricklaying efficiency immediately improved. I laid more than 2,200 bricks that day, with an average of 1,900 bricks per person in the whole group.

　　There was an old technician in our group named Zhao Shiqi. The transferred soldiers respected him very much and called him "Master." But he was never included in these matters of emulation campaigns. Master Zhao had a strong sense of self-esteem and sometimes complained about this. Seeing this situation, I mobilized Zhao Shiqi and said, "Master Zhao, we are all apprentices you raised, and without your efforts, where would our contributions come from? The glory of our group includes your share. Now everyone has created new records, why don't you create one too!" Master Zhao was very moved at the time, and he said, "Alright! I'll give it a try tomorrow." As a result, he created a record of laying more than 2,700 bricks in one day.

　　Originally, when I laid bricks up to more than 2,600, I thought that was the limit! It couldn't get any higher than that. Seeing Zhao Shiqi's achievements, I thought to myself: Work hard! Zhang Qingxiang, you are far behind.

　　I carefully observed Zhao Shiqi's operating process, and my bricklaying efficiency also reached more than 3,000. One day, when I was working, people kicked my grouting ladle under the scaffolding. Fearing that it would waste time, I didn't go down to pick it up and just grabbed a mud bucket to use, and it felt quite right. Later, I saw that the grouting efficiency was much higher than using a grouting ladle. Lying in bed that night, I pondered for a while, and then I sat up. I picked up a cardboard box for shoes and imitated it to cut out a new model of the grouting bucket, and presented it to the leaders of the work area. The leaders of the work area made a new grouting bucket according to my model. Using a small bucket for grouting was indeed very efficient. That day, I laid 3,800 bricks, and then raised it to 3,977 bricks. This was the highest record when the new quota was implemented at the First Automobile Factory construction site. But I don't see it as the "highest." I have had this experience, if I also think it is the "highest record," then it will never be improved.

　　Now, our group has begun to promote the Soviet Kovalev bricklaying method. By promoting this advanced working method, we can strive to achieve higher quotas, so that we can build walls for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant faster, and we can contribute our share to completing the engineering tasks of the First Automobile Factory ahead of schedule. Celebrating the "May 1st" International Labor Day, we must strive to achieve higher quotas.

　　为争取达到更高的定额而努力
　　吉林省劳动模范转业军人　张庆祥
    我原是人民解放军的战士，现在是第一汽车制造厂工地上的五级工。
    说实话，当上级叫我转业的时候，我可真是想不通。我一心一意想去抗美援朝，结果没有去成。参军时，乡亲们敲锣打鼓，给我骑马挂花，自己也在乡亲们面前说过：“不把侵略者打败，决不回家。”可是连侵略者的面也没看见，我怎么能回家呢？后来，我又想：转就转吧，没有在抗美援朝的前线上立功，就到建设岗位上来贡献自己的力量去吧！
    来到建设岗位，上级分配我去学砌墙。
    砌墙这件事，看起来没有什么奥妙，要做好可并不容易。开始，我们几个转业军人，同熟练的技术工人在一起干活。可是一样的泥浆、一样的砖，人家做得又快又好，自己砌得又慢又糟。那时，国家定额是每天每人砌砖一千二百块，我们只能砌到六百块。原来打算来建设岗位上立功，结果却达不到生产定额，这可真叫我难过极了。说也奇怪，在学砌墙的那些日子，天天下雨，想在业余时间多练一会都不行。后来我们发现工人做的快，我们做的慢，主要是不会用泥刀。于是我们就把砖和泥浆搬到宿舍里，一手拿着泥刀、一手搬着砖，把泥浆抹上、刮掉；刮掉、再抹上，经过了这样一番苦学和苦练，我们开始掌握了砌墙技术，不久就达到了每天砌砖一千三百块的纪录。
    我还记得，当我最初突破国家定额的时候，转业来的同志们向我祝贺，领导上开会叫我介绍经验。党和同志们的鼓励，使我增加了信心和勇气。于是，我像在部队练兵时那样，把一切精力都集中到砌砖工作上。结果就创造了每天砌砖一千七百块的新纪录。我们的小组也都先后突破了国家定额。因为有了这个成绩，上级奖给我们小组一面“优胜”红旗。我出席了建筑工程部在一九五四年春天召开的功臣模范代表会议。
    从北京回来不久，我们接受了另一工场的任务。这里的砌墙工程是“清水墙”，跟我们原来学的活不一样，而且定额很高，每人每天要砌一千八百块砖。当时，工人们接受不了，就连一些老技工也一口咬定达不到。可是我想：既然国家定了一千八百块，那就一定能达到。从我自身的经历来说，国家办事从来都是有根有据的，对劳动定额的制定，就更不会马虎。在小组讨论计划时，有人主张定一千六百块，有人主张定一千七百块，我就坚持不能少于一千八百块。我说：“要是我们的计划比国家定额还低，那还讨论什么哩！”因为大家一时扭不过来，就决定试验试验再说。这一试验不要紧，一连三天谁也没有达到定额，墙却越砌越高，困难也就越来越大。这时候，工段的负责同志很着急：就对我说：
  “老张，以前你们不论接受什么任务，总是超额完成，这回怎么落后了呢？”我听了这话可真难过。心想：咱是穿过解放军衣服的人，转业时还宣誓要在建设岗位上立功，难道就不能超过国家定额吗？当天晚上，我翻来复去睡不着。想着这几天工作当中的缺点。想来想去，想到了王其进。他也是一个转业军人，挖土方时，我们肩并肩地在一起工作，他那个小组也立过集体功。于是我找到了他，把砌砖情况对他说了一遍，并问他能不能配合我们设法改进工作。王其进可真痛快。他说：“没问题，保证你们有砖、有灰浆用。”配合问题一解决，砌砖效率马上提高了。我在这天砌了二千二百多块砖，全组平均每人砌一千九百块。
    我们小组里有一个老技工，叫赵士其。转业军人都很尊敬他，叫他师傅。可是在立功竞赛这些事上，从来不吸收他参加。赵师傅的自尊心很强，有时候就为这事发牢骚。我看到这种情况，就动员赵士其说：“赵师傅，我们都是你一手提拔起来的徒弟，没有你的努力，那有我们的功劳呢？咱们小组的光荣，就有你的一份。现在大家都创造了新纪录，你也创一个吧！”赵师傅当时很感动，他说：“好吧！明天咱就来一下。”结果，他创造了一天砌砖二千七百多块的纪录。
    原先，当我砌砖砌到二千六百多块的时候，我以为这就顶了天啦！再高也高不到那里去了。看到赵士其的成绩，我就暗自想道：努力吧！张庆祥，你还差得远哩。
    我仔细察看了赵士其的操作过程、砌砖效率也就达到了三千块以上。有一天，我正在干活，人们把我的灌浆勺子踢到了脚手架下。我怕耽误时间，没有下去拣，就顺手拉过一个泥桶来使，觉得挺对劲。后来一看，灌浆效率要比用灌浆勺高得多。晚上躺在床上琢磨了一会，就一翻身坐了起来。拾起一个盛皮鞋的纸盒子，比划着剪成一个新的灌浆桶的模型，提给工区领导上。工区领导上根据我的模型做成了新的灌浆桶。用过小桶灌浆，效率的确高得很。当天我就砌了三千八百块砖，随后又提高到三千九百七十七块。在第一汽车厂工地推行新定额的时候，这是最高纪录。可是我并不把它看成“最高”。我有过这样的经验，如果自己也认为它是“最高纪录”，那就再也不会提高了。
    现在，我们小组已经开始推行苏联的郭瓦洛夫砌砖法。推广了这个先进工作方法，我们就可以争取达到更高的定额，好给第一汽车制造厂更快地砌墙，也就能在提前完成第一汽车厂的工程任务中尽到我们的一分力量。庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，我们一定要为争取达到更高的定额而努力。
