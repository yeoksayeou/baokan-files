　　Sichuan, Jiangsu and Other Cotton-Producing Provinces Expand Cotton Planting Areas
　　Sichuan Province plans to plant 4.38 million mu of cotton in 1955, an increase of more than 430,000 mu compared with 1954, and the total cotton output is expected to increase by 15 percent. By the beginning of May, more than 50 percent of the province's cotton fields had been sown, and cotton on winter fallow land and early-maturing spring crops in mountainous areas had been basically sown. To support cotton production, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied more than 6,400 tons of ammonium sulfate, more than 1,300 tons of phosphate rock powder and some cake fertilizer to cotton-producing areas such as Jianyang and Renshou; in addition, more than 5,000 sprayers and more than 500 tons of insecticides were prepared. Farmers are in high spirits to plant cotton, and even mountainous areas that rarely grew cotton in the past are trying to grow it this year. Pingwu County planted only about 500 mu last year, but this year it has expanded to nearly 10,000 mu, and more than 6,000 mu of winter fallow land has been planted. (Our correspondent in Chongqing)
　　Jiangsu Province plans to expand the cotton planting area this year by 27.4 percent compared with the actual harvested area last year. Nantong Sanyu District plans to plant 165,000 mu of Dai-character cotton, an increase of more than 10,000 mu compared with last year. Yancheng Prefecture reclaimed more than 197,000 mu of wasteland this spring and adjusted more than 300,000 mu of high land suitable for cotton planting. At present, the vast number of cotton farmers are actively sowing cotton in accordance with the plan. In Xuzhou and Huaiyin Prefectures, 50 percent of the total area of cotton fields had been sown by the end of April, and Pixian and Huaiyin counties have already finished. Yancheng Prefecture has sown 1.14 million mu. The double-cropping cotton fields in Nantong, Songjiang, Suzhou and other prefectures have also begun to be sown. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)
　　The 420,000 mu of cotton fields in the four main cotton-producing counties of Cixi, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing and Shangyu in Zhejiang Province have been sown. In Xiaoshan, Haining and other counties, cotton planted after Grain Rain has grown into two-inch-high green seedlings. During cotton planting, many cotton farmers used field-edge planting, so that each mu planted 400 more cotton plants.
　　At present, the Zhejiang cotton area has entered the seedling protection stage, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has allocated 2,500 sprayers and more than 800,000 jin of insecticides to the cotton area to supply cotton farmers' needs for insect prevention.

　　四川江苏等省产棉区扩大棉花播种面积
    四川省一九五五年计划种棉四百三十八万亩，比一九五四年扩大四十三万多亩，预计棉花总产量增加百分之十五。到五月初全省百分之五十以上的棉田均已下种，山区的冬闲地和早熟小春作物地棉花已基本播种完毕。为了支援棉花生产，省供销社供应简阳、仁寿等产棉区硫酸錏六千四百多吨、磷矿粉一千三百多吨和一部分饼肥；另外还准备了喷雾器五千多部和五百多吨杀虫药。农民种棉情绪很高，连过去很少种棉的山区今年也试种了。平武县去年只种五百亩左右，今年扩大近一万亩，并有六千多亩冬闲地已经种完。  （本报驻重庆记者）
    江苏省今年计划植棉面积比去年实收面积扩大百分之二十七点四。南通三余区计划种岱字棉十六万五千亩，比去年扩大一万多亩。盐城专区今年春开荒十九万七千多亩，并调整了三十多万亩适宜植棉的高地。目前广大棉农都积极按照计划播种棉花。徐州、淮阴两专区在四月底下种棉田已达总面积百分之五十，邳县、淮阴等县已经结束。盐城专区已下种一百十四万亩。南通、松江、苏州等专区的二熟棉田也都开始播种。  （本报驻南京记者）
    浙江省慈溪、萧山、绍兴、上虞四个主要产棉县的四十二万亩棉田已播种完毕。萧山、海宁等县在谷雨后播种棉花已长出二寸高的绿苗。植棉中，许多棉农利用田边种植，使每亩多种四百棵棉花。
    目前，浙江棉区已进入保苗阶段，省供销社已将二千五百架喷雾器，和八十多万斤杀虫药剂拨运棉区供应棉农防虫需要。  （本报驻杭州记者）
