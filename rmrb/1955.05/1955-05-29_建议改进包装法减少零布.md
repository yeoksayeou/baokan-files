To the Editorial Department:

　　We are staff members of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Dyeing Factory. We suggest that leading organs promptly resolve the problem of a large amount of scrap cloth being produced by textile enterprises.

　　The length of each bolt of cotton cloth and printed fabric produced by textile dyeing factories is different, but the packaging requires a fixed length for each bolt (for example, thirty yards). In this way, after a whole bolt of cloth is cut, what remains is scrap cloth. The length of the scrap cloth varies, with some pieces being more than four yards long and others less than one yard. Because the use of scrap cloth is limited, the selling price is generally only three-quarters of the retail price of a whole bolt of cloth, which causes undue losses to the state.

　　This loss can be avoided. In the Soviet Union, printed fabrics are packaged using the method of piecing bolts together and piecing packages together, meaning the length of each bolt does not need to be the same, and there is no need to cut off scrap cloth. Our country also uses this packaging method for woolen products. In Shanghai, some joint state-private and private printing and dyeing factories that process cloth for the China Textile Company have been implementing this method for a long time. This proves that avoiding the generation of scrap cloth does not present insurmountable difficulties.

　　However, this problem has not been resolved in our state-owned factories. The East China Textile Administration Bureau once requested that each factory trial this method, but after a short trial period, it issued a notice to stop.

　　The loss caused by scrap cloth is significant. In our factory's printing and dyeing workshop alone, the loss caused by scrap cloth is 180,000 yuan per year; if the losses suffered by factories across the country are added together, the figure is alarming. The longer the implementation of the piecing bolts together and piecing packages together method is delayed, the more the state property will be lost. We hope that the Ministry of Textile Industry will pay attention to this issue.

### 建议改进包装法减少零布

　　建议改进包装法减少零布编辑同志：
    我们是国营上海第二棉纺织染厂的工作人员。我们建议领导机关迅速解决纺织企业生产大量零布的问题。
    纺织染厂生产的棉布和花色布每匹长度都是不一样的，但是包装时每匹都有规定的长度（例如三十码）。这样，把整匹的布剪下后，剩下的就是零布。零布的长度不一，长的有四码多，短的不到一码。因为零布的用途受到限制，售价一般只有整匹布零售价格的四分之三，这就使国家受到了不应有的损失。
    这种损失是可以避免的。苏联的花色布都采取拼匹和拼件包装办法，这就是每匹布的长度不求一样，不需要剪下零布。我国的毛织品也采取这种包装办法。在上海，一些公私合营和私营的印染厂代花纱布公司加工的布匹，实行这种办法也很久了。证明了要避免零布的产生，并没有不能克服的困难。
    但是，这个问题在我们国营工厂里却一直没有解决。华东纺织管理局曾经要求各厂试行这个办法，但是试行不久又通知停止了。
    零布所造成的损失是很大的。单就我们厂的印染工场来说，一年中因零布而造成的损失就有十八万元；如果把全国各厂所受损失合计起来，数字是惊人的。拼匹和拼件包装办法迟实行一天，国家财产就会受到更多的损失。希望纺织工业部重视这个问题。朱金汤　杨贯荫
