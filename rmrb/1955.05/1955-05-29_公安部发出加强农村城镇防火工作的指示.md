　　The Ministry of Public Security Issues Directive on Strengthening Fire Prevention in Rural Towns
    The Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China recently issued a directive on strengthening fire prevention in rural towns.

      The directive first points out: In the past six months, many rural towns have experienced major fires. The fires have caused losses to the wealth of the state and the people, and the losses to some factories and enterprises have been particularly severe, some even disrupting factory production and affecting the normal supply of materials in certain areas.

    The directive then points out that the basic reason for the severity of rural fires is that the public security organs in many places do not have a sufficient understanding of rural fire prevention work and do not understand that this is an important task to ensure the smooth implementation of socialist construction and socialist transformation. They have not strengthened their leadership over this work. In particular, they are not sufficiently vigilant regarding the serious losses caused by fires and the serious situation of counter-revolutionaries carrying out arson and sabotage. They rarely conduct fire prevention education among the masses or take concrete measures, and they often do not seriously investigate and handle the aftermath of major fires. If this serious paralysis of thought does not receive sufficient attention and vigilance, and leadership and preventive measures are not effectively strengthened, fires will cause even more serious political and economic losses to us.

    The directive mentions that fire prevention measures must be strengthened in the following aspects in the future:

    First, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over rural fire prevention work. Any complacency and paralysis of thought that neglects rural fire prevention work, thinking that "rural fire protection work is dispensable and unimportant," is extremely harmful and must be thoroughly criticized and corrected. Public security organs at all levels should designate special personnel to be responsible for strengthening specific leadership. The fire prevention work must be centered on county towns and market towns, focus on factories, warehouses, enterprises, and larger agricultural producers' cooperatives, and take into account important mountain forests. We must conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention first, firefighting second," and regularly inspect and study fire situations and preventive measures, give full play to the role of security committees and mass fire protection organizations, in order to improve rural fire protection work.

    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen propaganda and education, and mobilize the masses for fire prevention. This is the basic link in the current rural fire prevention work. Public security organs at all levels, especially county public security bureaus, must combine with various central tasks to conduct fire prevention education among the masses in coordination with relevant departments. On the basis of deeply mobilizing the masses, focusing on residents around county towns, market towns, agricultural producers' cooperatives, as well as mountain forests, factories, warehouses, and enterprises, launch the signing of fire prevention covenants, establish and improve mass fire prevention organizations, and conduct regular fire prevention inspections. Factories and warehouses should especially tighten fire prevention systems, improve safe operating procedures, improve the storage and safekeeping of materials, and designate special personnel and special organizations to be responsible for fire protection work. Furthermore, we must be highly vigilant against enemy arson and sabotage; we should mobilize security committees, militias, and the broad masses to strengthen prevention. During mass gatherings, as well as during the summer and autumn harvests, prevention should be especially strengthened.

    Finally, fire accidents must be seriously investigated and properly handled. All localities should conduct a systematic investigation and study of the fire accidents that have occurred, distinguish their nature and circumstances, and seriously deal with the personnel involved. In the future, all counter-revolutionaries and other illegal elements who intentionally commit arson, whether or not a disaster occurs, must be handed over to the People's Court for severe punishment in accordance with the law; those who are seriously paralyzed, derelict in their duties, and consistently negligent, causing fires that result in significant losses to the state and the people, should also be requested to be punished by the People's Court in accordance with the law.

### 公安部发出加强农村城镇防火工作的指示

　　公安部发出加强农村城镇防火工作的指示
    中华人民共和国公安部最近发出关于加强农村城镇的防火工作的指示。
      指示中首先指出：近半年来，有不少农村城镇发生大火，火灾使国家和人民的财富受到了损失，特别是一些工厂企业单位损失更为严重，有的甚至中断了工厂的生产，影响了某些地区物资的正常供应。
    指示接着指出，农村火灾严重的基本原因，是不少地方的公安机关对农村防火工作认识不够，不了解这是为保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业顺利实施的一项重要工作，没有加强对这一工作的领导。特别对于火灾所造成的严重损失，以及反革命分子进行纵火破坏的严重情况警惕不够；平时很少向群众进行防火教育和采取具体措施，发生大火后也往往不认真地追查和处理。这种严重的麻痹思想，如果再不引起足够的重视和警惕，切实加强领导和防范措施，火灾就会使我们在政治上、经济上遭到更加严重的损失。
    指示提到今后必须从以下几方面加强防火的措施：
    首先必须加强农村防火工作的领导。任何忽视农村防火工作，认为“农村消防工作可有可无，不关重要”等自满、麻痹思想，都是极其有害的，必须彻底加以批判和纠正。各地公安机关应指定专人负责，加强具体领导。防火工作的进行，必须以县城、集镇为中心，工厂、仓库、企业和较大的农业生产合作社为重点，兼顾重要山林，认真贯彻“以防为主，以消为辅”的方针，并定期检查研究火灾情况和预防措施，充分发挥治安保卫委员会和群众性消防组织的作用，以改进农村消防工作。
    其次，要加强宣传教育，发动群众防火。这是目前农村防火工作的基本环节。各地公安机关，特别是县公安局，必须结合各项中心工作，协同有关部门向群众进行防火教育。在深入发动群众的基础上，以县城、集镇、农业生产合作社及山林、工厂、仓库、企业周围的居民为重点，发动订立防火公约，建立和健全群众性防火组织，定期进行防火检查。工厂、仓库内部尤其应该严密防火制度，健全安全操作规程，改善物资的储存、保管办法，并指定专人和专门组织负责消防工作。再其次，要十分警惕敌人纵火破坏；应发动治安保卫委员会、民兵和广大群众严加防范，在群众集会的时候，以及夏收、秋收的季节，应特别加强防范。
    最后，要认真追查和正确处理火灾事故。各地对已发生的火灾事故，应认真进行一次系统的调查和研究，分别性质和情节，对有关人员进行严肃处理。今后对于一切有意纵火的反革命分子以及其他不法分子，无论成灾与否，都必须依法送交人民法院从严惩处；对于严重麻痹失职，一贯玩忽职守引起火灾而造成国家和人民重大损失的分子，也应请求人民法院依法惩处。（新华社）
