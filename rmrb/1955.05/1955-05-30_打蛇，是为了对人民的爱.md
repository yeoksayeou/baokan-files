　　Striking Snakes is for the Love of the People
　　Cao Jinghua
　　The crimes of the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique have aroused the boundless anger of the people of the whole country. The Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association held a joint enlarged meeting and made timely and necessary resolutions to expel Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association and remove him from his posts. This is entirely in accordance with the urgent demands of the people of the motherland.
　　The two batches of Hu Feng's secret letters recently revealed are truly shocking. It turns out that Hu Feng, who stood before us, was a nine-headed snake who has consistently harmed the Party, the people, and the revolution! For a long time, comrades were deceived by him, which is terrible!
　　Recalling the War of Resistance Against Japan, in Chongqing, the high pressure of the Kuomintang made it difficult for people to breathe. All progressive literary and art workers, under the care and leadership of the Party, followed the Party's instructions to abandon minor differences and seek common ground, and launched a struggle against the Kuomintang's bloody secret service rule. The comrades in the literary and art circles were all of one heart and one mind, closely united around the Party, and directed a general struggle against the fascist secret service rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. But at that time, in that environment, Hu Feng and his clique directed their spearhead at the Party, at the people, and at the revolution! Hu Feng's hatred for the Party, the people, and the revolution was no different from that of the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents! Now that this poisonous snake has revealed its true colors, as the saying goes, strike the snake at its seven inches. Even a poisonous snake must be ground into powder and thoroughly disinfected. This is for the love of the people.

　　打蛇，是为了对人民的爱
　　曹靖华
    胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的罪行，激起了全国人民的无比的愤怒，中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议，作了适时的、必要的决议，开除了胡风的中国作家协会的会籍和他所担任的职务。这是完全符合祖国人民的迫切的要求的。
    最近所揭露的两批胡风的密信，真令人吃惊。原来在我们面前的胡风，却是一条一贯危害党、危害人民、危害革命的九头蛇！长期以来，同志们被他瞒了过去，这是多么可怕！
    回想在抗战期间，在重庆，国民党的高压压得人喘不过气来。所有进步文艺工作者，在党的关怀和领导下，遵循着党的舍小异而取大同的指示，团结一切可能团结的力量，展开了反国民党的血腥特务统治的斗争。文艺界的同志们都一心一德，亲密地团结在党的周围，把一个总的斗争的矛头，针对着蒋贼法西斯特务统治。而就在那时，在那样环境下，胡风及其集团却把矛头针对着党，对着人民，对着革命！胡风对党、对人民、对革命仇恨之深，与美蒋特务毫无区别！现在这条毒蛇原形毕露了，俗话说，蛇打七寸，对毒蛇还要把它研成粉末，彻底消毒。这是为了对人民的爱。
