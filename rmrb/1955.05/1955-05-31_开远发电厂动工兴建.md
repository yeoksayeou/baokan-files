　　The construction of the Kaiyuan Power Plant, the second automated thermal power plant in Southwest China, has begun. The foundation of the main plant building began to be excavated in early May. A dedicated railway is being extended to the construction site. Prefabrication factories, such as the timber processing plant, the rebar prefabrication plant, and the metal structure processing plant, are also stepping up production of various prefabricated components.

　　The Kaiyuan Power Plant is being built near the Gejiu Tin Mine. The electricity generated in the future will mainly be used to meet the needs of expanding production at the Gejiu Tin Mine, with a portion supplied for civilian use.

　　Soviet experts provided assistance and guidance during the construction preparation work for this power plant. Large quantities of construction materials were transported from Anshan, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Chongqing. Currently, various construction machinery needed for construction, such as cranes, winches, and dump trucks, are still being shipped in from various locations.

　  开远发电厂动工兴建
    西南地区第二座自动化火力发电厂——开远发电厂开始动工建设了。这座发电厂的主厂房基础，在五月初就开始挖掘。一条专用铁道正在向工地伸展。木材加工厂和钢筋预制品厂、金属结构加工厂等预制工厂，也在加紧生产着各种预制构件。
    开远发电厂建设在个旧锡矿附近，将来发出的电力，主要用来满足个旧锡矿扩大生产的需要，一部分供给民用。
    这个电厂在进行施工准备工作时，得到了苏联专家的帮助和指导。鞍山、太原、武汉、天津和重庆等地，运来了大批建筑物资。现在，施工需要的各种起重机、卷扬机和自卸卡车等施工机械，还在源源不断地从各地运来。　（新华社）
