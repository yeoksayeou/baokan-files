Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th:  Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke to a reporter from this agency on the progress of Shandong Province's rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work. He said: Shandong Province began rectifying grain unified purchase and sale work in mid-March. On April 18th, the Provincial Party Committee issued an urgent directive, requiring Party committees at all levels to regard the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work as an extremely important political and economic measure to stabilize farmers' production morale and ensure spring plowing production; at the same time, it dispatched three members of the Provincial Party Committee and several key responsible cadres to Tai'an, Heze, Huimin, Jining, and other local Party committees for key inspections and assistance. The local Party committees also convened county Party secretary meetings to deploy the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work. Party committees and county committees in areas like Heze and Huimin transferred fifty to one hundred cadres in succession to various townships to assist district and township cadres in extensively educating Party members and the masses on unified purchase and sale policies, ascertain grain shortage situations, announce unified purchase and sale quotas, conduct democratic appraisals, and do a good job in supply work. After this period of work, currently, about 30% of the townships in the province have completed the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work, and the tense situation of unified purchase and sale has stabilized. The unreasonable grain supply volume in the province began to gradually decrease in April. For example, the average daily sales volume in mid-April decreased by 12.17% compared to the first ten days of the month, and the last ten days of the month decreased by 7.45% compared to the middle ten days, and 18.71% compared to the first ten days.

Shu Tong said: Shandong Province's agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest last year. The total grain output of the province increased by 4.2 billion jin compared to 1953, and the grain purchased and levied by the state last year only increased by 940 million jin compared to 1953. However, the planned grain supply to farmers in the province for the first and second quarters of this year reached more than 1.42 billion jin (excluding pasta), an increase of more than 200 million jin compared to the same period last year. If calculated at one jin per person per day, it can supply the entire ration for half a year to more than 17% of the agricultural population in the province, which makes it entirely possible to solve the supply problem for grain-deficient farmers. However, since mid-March, a serious and abnormal phenomenon of tight grain unified purchase and sale in rural areas and unstable farmer morale has emerged. This is mainly due to the crude grain unified purchase and sale work, unreasonable supply, uncontrolled supply quotas, and even some grassroots cadres engaging in malfeasance. According to preliminary inspections in Pingyi, Zanhua, De County, Zou Ping County and other counties, among the original 33,355 households supplied, 2,059 households should not have been supplied or were oversupplied, and only 69 households should have been supplied but were not. Facts prove that as long as we strengthen grain unified purchase and sale work, make the supply reasonable, and compress and control the sales volume of grain, it is entirely possible.

Shu Tong said: The improvement of the tense grain unified purchase and sale situation in Shandong Province's rural areas is only preliminary. A part of the region is still tense, and even the tense situation in individual regions continues to develop. Therefore, we must not be paralyzed and complacent by the above preliminary improvements, and we must conscientiously continue to implement the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on stepping up the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work. Experience proves that the key to doing a good job in rectifying grain unified purchase and sale work lies in our ability to truly believe in the masses and rely on the masses, publicize unified purchase and sale quotas to the masses, let the masses fully discuss, and conduct democratic appraisals. In areas where this is done, the tense situation will ease, farmers' morale will stabilize, and the sales volume of grain will decrease; conversely, the practice of simply engaging in and coercing orders without believing in the masses will not only fail to ease the tense situation but also increase the degree of tension.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th: More than 3,000 townships in Henan Province have completed the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work. The newly formulated grain supply quotas in these townships are all lower than the original unified purchase and sale quotas. The false phenomenon of crying out for grain shortages and the phenomenon of wasting grain in the past have changed. Wen County originally had 7,160 farmer households crying out for grain shortages. After rectification, 62% of these households voluntarily no longer requested grain supplies. After rectification in fifteen townships in Runan County, the unified sales volume of grain decreased by 40% compared to the original grain supply volume. The masses generally reflected that after rectification, the grain supply was fairer and more reasonable than before.

The farmers in these townships were educated in the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work and voluntarily exposed the false phenomenon of grain shortages. Zhang Maizi, a farmer from Shishuling Township in Xin'an County, said: "In the past, when I saw others asking for grain, I was afraid of suffering losses, so I also shouted along; to be honest, the grain stored at home can still be eaten until the wheat harvest." Yang Zhongcai, a farmer from Huaxing Township in Luoning County, understood the grain unified purchase and sale policy and did the math: now, if I use the money to buy one jin of grain to buy fertilizer and apply it to the land, I can harvest two or three jin in the autumn; if I buy one jin of grain and put it at home, I don't need it right now, and it will still be one jin of grain in the autumn. So he invested the money he originally planned to buy 100 jin of grain into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 9th: As of the 5th, the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work in Guangxi Province has been launched in about half of the province's villages. Many townships in Qinzhou and Rong County prefectures, which have made faster progress, and the counties under the jurisdiction of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region have begun to carry out mass appraisal work. Wherever the grain unified purchase and sale work has been rectified, the state grain supply quota has generally decreased. At present, the province's grain supply quota has decreased by 30% to 40% compared to the highest quota in mid-to-late April.

### 山东河南广西许多乡初步整顿了统销工作　粮食供应状况趋向稳定合理

　　山东河南广西许多乡初步整顿了统销工作
　　粮食供应状况趋向稳定合理
    据新华社济南十日电　中共山东省委员会第一书记舒同就山东省整顿粮食统销工作的进展情况对本社记者发表谈话。他说：山东省整顿粮食统销工作是在三月中旬开始的，到四月十八日，省委又发出紧急指示，要求各级党委把整顿粮食统销工作作为稳定农民生产情绪、保证春耕生产的一项极为重要的政治和经济措施；同时又派出三个省委委员和几个主要负责干部分别到泰安、菏泽、惠民、济宁等地委进行重点检查和帮助。各地委也先后召开县委书记会议部署了整顿粮食统销工作。菏泽、惠民等地区的地委、县委都抽调了五十到一百个干部陆续派到各乡帮助区、乡干部向党员、群众广泛进行统销政策的教育，摸清缺粮情况，公布统销指标，进行民主评议，做好供应工作。经过这一段工作，目前，全省已有百分之三十左右的乡整顿粮食统销工作已经结束，统销紧张情况已稳定下来。全省不合理的粮食供应量四月份已开始逐渐减少。如四月中旬平均日销量较上旬下降百分之十二点一七，下旬又较中旬下降百分之七点四五，较上旬下降百分之十八点七一。
    舒同说：山东省的农业生产去年获得丰收。全省粮食总产量比一九五三年增加了四十二亿斤，国家去年收购和征收的粮食仅比一九五三年增加了九亿四千万斤。而今年第一、二季度全省计划供应农民的粮食达十四亿二千多万斤（不包括面食业），比去年同期增加了两亿多斤。如按每人每天供应一斤计算，则可供应全省百分之十七以上的农业人口半年全部口粮，这完全可能解决缺粮农民的供应问题。但从三月中旬以后，却出现农村粮食统销紧张，农民情绪不稳定的严重反常现象。这主要是由于粮食统销工作做的粗糙，供应不合理，供应指标不加控制，甚至有的基层干部徇私舞弊所造成。据平邑、沾化、德县、邹平等县初步检查，在原供应三万三千三百五十五户中，不应供应或供应过多者即有二千零五十九户，应供应而未供应者只有六十九户。事实证明，只要加强粮食统销工作，使供应合理，压缩和控制粮食的销量是完全可能的。
    舒同说：目前山东省农村粮食统销紧张情况的好转仅是初步的，还有一部分地区仍然紧张，甚至个别地区紧张情况还在继续发展。因此，我们决不能为上述初步好转而麻痹自满，必须认真地继续贯彻国务院及中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示。经验证明：做好整顿粮食统销工作的关键在于我们能真正相信群众、依靠群众，把统销指标向群众公布，让群众充分讨论，进行民主评定。凡是这样作的地区，紧张情况就会缓和下来，农民情绪稳定，粮食销售数量减少；反之，凡是不相信群众的简单从事和强迫命令的作法，不仅不能使紧张情况缓和下来，还会增加紧张程度。
    新华社郑州八日电　河南省已有三千多个乡结束了整顿粮食统销工作。这些乡新制定的粮食供应指标都低于原订统销指标。往日叫喊缺粮的虚假现象和浪费粮食的现象已有改变。温县原来有七千一百六十户农民叫喊缺粮，经过整顿后，其中有百分之六十二的农户自动不再要求供应粮食。汝南县有十五个乡经过整顿后，粮食统销量比原来的粮食供应量减少百分之四十。群众普遍反映：经过整顿后，粮食供应比以前更加公平合理。
    这些乡的农民在整顿粮食统销工作中受到教育，都自动地揭发了缺粮的虚假现象。新安县柿树岭乡农民张麦子说：“以前看到别人要粮，怕自己吃亏，也就跟着喊叫；说实话，家里存的粮食还可吃到麦收。”洛宁县华兴乡农民杨中才明白了粮食统销政策后，算了一笔账：现在把买一斤粮食的钱买上肥料上到地里，秋后能收二、三斤；如果买一斤粮食放在家里，眼前用不着，存到秋后还是一斤粮食。于是他把原来打算买一百斤粮食的钱投入了生产。
    新华社南宁九日电　截至五日止，广西省整顿粮食统销工作已在全省一半左右的乡村展开。进展较快的钦州、容县等专区和桂西僮族自治区所辖县的许多乡已开始进行群众性的评议工作。凡粮食统销工作经过整顿的乡，国家粮食供应指标普遍下降。目前全省粮食供应指标已比四月中、下旬最高指标下降了百分之三十至四十。
