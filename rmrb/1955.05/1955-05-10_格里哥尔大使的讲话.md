Dear friends and comrades!

    Ten years ago, in May 1945, the Second World War ended. The Soviet Union, which bore the main burden in this war against the fascist aggressors, crushed the Hitlerite army with the powerful blows of its heroic troops, and also brought freedom to the Czechoslovak people in its victorious march. The Czechoslovak people, who had been betrayed by the governments of Western capitalist countries in 1938, after endless suffering and six years of struggle against the fascist bandits, finally achieved victory on May 9, 1945, thanks to the Soviet Union, and returned to a free life. In our suffering, the Soviet Union was our only true friend and ally. Therefore, the experience gained by our people in their greatest misfortune, having recognized their best friend, prompted our people to firmly decide to always follow the Soviet Union and never take any other path.

    The Soviet Union brought us more than just freedom. Because the Soviet Union brought us liberation, our people were able to freely decide that they would never return to the old system of the past, but on the contrary, would take the road of people's democracy towards a happier tomorrow - a socialist tomorrow. With the help of the Soviet Union, our people healed the wounds of war and occupation. During the two-year plan, our people restored their industry and raised it to pre-war levels. In 1949, our people began the first plan for developing the national economy. In the process of implementing this plan, thanks to the further systematic and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and thanks to the fraternal cooperation of the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries, which is growing in significance, our people have achieved brilliant success. Our industrial production has more than doubled in just five years. In the process of socialist industrialization, the structure of our industrial production has fundamentally changed. Heavy industry production has increased, especially machine industry production, which has more than tripled. In agriculture, a solid foundation has also been laid for the socialist transformation of the countryside. The material welfare and cultural living standards of the entire people have been greatly improved.

    The reason we have been able to achieve these successes is because the people of the Czechoslovak Republic have wholeheartedly joined the powerful peace camp, which, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, with the fraternal cooperation of the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, and with the support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, has successfully thwarted the conspiracies of the war instigators and defended peace throughout the world.

    The Czechoslovak people clearly see that the People's Republic of China is becoming more and more consolidated and powerful day by day, and is constantly making great contributions to the cause of strengthening peace. The process and results of the Asian-African Conference are the most eloquent proof of these facts.

    Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the liberation of our country by the Soviet army, and on the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the beginning of socialist construction in our country, our people are willing to express their firm and unwavering determination to always advance together with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries.

    The Czechoslovak Republic is the western outpost of the peace camp, standing against the hotbed of war that is forming in West Germany. The People's Republic of China is the eastern outpost against all kinds of war conspiracies. The guarantee of the victory of our two peoples lies in the friendship and mutual assistance of our two peoples under the leadership of our two fraternal communist parties.

    Therefore, please allow me to drink to the achievements of the Chinese people on the road of building socialism, to the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China,

    To the heroic Communist Party of China, the guarantee of great achievements in building a powerful socialist China, to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China, the great son of the Chinese people, and Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

    To the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

### 格里哥尔大使的讲话

　　格里哥尔大使的讲话敬爱的朋友们和同志们！
    十年前，即一九四五年五月，第二次世界大战结束了。在这次反法西斯侵略者的战争中承受了主要负担的苏联以它的英勇军队的强大打击迎头粉碎了希特勒的军队，并在自己胜利的进军中也给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来了自由。在一九三八年被西方资本主义国家的政府出卖了的捷克斯洛伐克人民在经过无尽的苦难和六年的反法西斯强盗的斗争之后，由于苏联，才在一九四五年五月九日获得了胜利，重新回到了自由生活。在我们的苦难中，苏联是我们唯一真正的朋友和同盟者。因此我国人民在最大的不幸中认识了自己最好的朋友，这一根据切身体验所取得的经验促使我国人民坚定不移地决定永远跟着苏联走，决不走别的道路。
    苏联带给我们的不仅是自由。由于苏联给我们带来了解放，我国人民能够自由地决定永远也不会回到过去旧制度去，而且恰恰相反，要通过人民民主的道路走向更幸福的明天——社会主义的明天。在苏联的帮助下，我国人民治好了战争和占领所带来的创伤。两年计划期间，我国人民恢复了自己的工业，并把它提高到了战前水平，一九四九年我国人民开始了第一个发展国民经济的计划。在实行这个计划的过程中，由于苏联进一步系统的、无私的帮助，由于意义日益增长的中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家兄弟般的合作，我国人民获得了光辉的成就。我国工业生产量在短短的五年中就已增加了一倍多。在社会主义工业化的过程中，我国的工业生产的结构，从根本上改变了。重工业生产提高了，尤其是机器工业的生产提高了两倍多。在农业中也为农村的社会主义改造奠定了牢固的基础。全体人民的物质福利和文化生活水平已大大地提高了。
    我们之所以能够获得这些成就，是由于捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民万众一心地参加了强大的和平阵营，和平阵营在苏联领导下，在中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的兄弟般的合作下，在全世界亿万爱好和平人们的支持下，成功地粉碎了战争挑拨者的阴谋，捍卫了全世界的和平。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民很清楚地看到，中华人民共和国一天比一天地更加巩固和强大，并且在加强和平的事业中不断作出巨大的贡献。亚非会议的进程和结果就是这些事实的最雄辩的证明。
    因此，我国人民在庆祝苏联军队解放我国的十周年之际，在庆祝在我们国家开始社会主义建设以来的十周年之际，愿表示坚决的毫不动摇的决心，要永远和苏联、中华人民共和国和其他的人民民主国家一道前进。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国是与在西德正在形成中的战争策源地相对峙的和平阵营在西方的前哨堡垒。中华人民共和国是反对各种战争阴谋的东方的前哨堡垒。我们两国人民胜利的保证就在于我们两国兄弟般的共产党领导下的我们两国人民的友谊和相互帮助。
    因此，请允许我为中国人民在建设社会主义道路上的成就而干杯，为捷克斯洛伐克和中华人民共和国两国人民之间永恒的和牢不可破的友谊而干杯，
    为在建设强大的社会主义中国这方面取得伟大成就的保证——英雄的中国共产党而干杯，为中国共产党主席、中国人民伟大的儿子、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志而干杯。
    为中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志的健康而干杯。
