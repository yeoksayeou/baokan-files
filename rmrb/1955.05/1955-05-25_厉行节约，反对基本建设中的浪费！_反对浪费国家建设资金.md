Practice Thrift and Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
　　Oppose Wasting National Construction Funds
　　Ma Nanfeng
　　The phenomenon of not valuing the economical use of funds and not valuing economic accounting in current capital construction is very common. In addition to waste caused by plans that are divorced from reality, blind construction, and design errors, it is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
　　(1) Design budgets are generally too high. According to the preliminary review of the design budgets for 49 construction units in 1955 by the People's Construction Bank of China, the overestimation averaged 9.6% of the original total budget. Among them, the design budget for the bank protection project of the Hankou Meat Joint Processing Factory was overestimated by 29% of the original budget; the design budget for the Caobuhu Sluice Gate project was overestimated by 28.81%; and the design budget for the Meishan Reservoir project was overestimated by 24.92%.
　　Due to the high design budget, the planned profit of the construction unit also exceeded the 2.5% stipulated by the state. High profits cover up the waste losses in capital construction. For example, the Eighth Engineering Company of the Electric Power General Bureau's Capital Construction Engineering Bureau contracted the Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant project. Although it lost 2.06 million yuan in waste during the construction process in 1954, it still obtained a planned profit and an above-plan profit of 1.07 million yuan. The Beijing Engineering Company of the Textile Industry Department contracted the Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory project, and the excess profit it obtained accounted for more than 9% of the total workload completed throughout the year. The profit rate of the East China Hydropower Installation Company reached 32% in the first half of 1954. In addition to a portion of the profit obtained from reducing costs, most of it was obtained due to the high design budget. Many construction enterprises often failed to turn in the profits they earned in a timely manner, and the funds accumulated in various construction units each year are a large amount.
　　(2) The planning of the use of funds is very poor, resulting in a lot of stockpiling and waste. Many construction units and construction enterprises began to purchase a large amount of materials before the planned tasks were determined. As a result, a large part of the materials could not be used and had to be stockpiled in warehouses. In the first quarter of this year, the Gansu Provincial Cultural Bureau applied for 292 tons of cement, but according to the determined investment plan, only 88 tons were needed for the whole year. There are also many construction units that violate financial regulations and arbitrarily spend state funds. For example, a certain tungsten mine in Jiangxi, in order to avoid handing over the surplus funds at the end of the year, bought many tools, instruments, sofas, and steel wire beds that were not urgently needed. The sofas that were bought took up all the space after all the furniture was removed from the office. The flowers and trees purchased by the Beijing No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory could not be planted even if all the open space in the factory was planted. Some construction units and construction enterprises also illegally carried out projects outside of the plan. For example, the Friendship Forest Administration unilaterally reduced the family dormitory project and built several very beautiful clubs with an area of 1,600 square meters. As a result, many employees' families had no houses to live in.
　　Another manifestation of not paying attention to the economical use of funds is that many construction units have a lot of internal resources, but they are not fully mobilized. According to an analysis of the 1955 financial revenue and expenditure plan (draft) of nine competent departments, the total amount of surplus funds at the end of 1954 was equivalent to 17% of the total capital construction workload of these nine competent departments in 1955, and in fact, the internal resources that can be mobilized are more than this number. Because the 1955 financial revenue and expenditure plan must be compiled and reported before the 1954 financial settlement is compiled. The number of surplus funds is filled in according to estimates and is generally low. According to the inspection of 21 construction units in Beijing and Tianjin by the People's Construction Bank of China, the surplus funds listed in the 1955 financial revenue and expenditure plan (draft) of 14 units were on average 40% lower than the 1954 financial settlement. This shows that the potential of internal resources that construction units can mobilize is very large.
　　The phenomenon of excessive funds also exists in construction enterprises. For example, the state stipulates that the self-owned working capital of construction enterprises generally accounts for about 14% of the annual contracted workload. However, according to a survey of 141 construction enterprises in November 1954, the actual amount of self-owned working capital exceeded the quota by an average of 17.5%, with the highest exceeding more than twice the quota.
　　(3) The phenomenon of not paying attention to the storage of equipment and not cherishing the use of equipment is even more common. The engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering cut more than 10,000 cubic meters of 8-meter-long timber into 4-meter-long short timber for use. The steel used for large materials for small purposes was also more than 1,400 tons. The wood factory under its jurisdiction sold 2,255 carts of good wood worth 60 yuan per cart as "waste wood" at a price of 5 yuan per cart, resulting in a loss of more than 120,000 yuan. More than 5,000 pieces of various tools were lost at the construction site of the Dahuo Fang Reservoir Dam in Liaoning Province in two months. The cement of the Engineering Company of the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry was used with reduced grade due to poor storage, amounting to more than 3,500 tons, resulting in a loss of more than 25,600 yuan. The funds wasted in these areas each year are very alarming.
　　There are many reasons for the above problems. First of all, the capital construction work procedures are not yet normal, the plan and design documents cannot be submitted in a timely manner, and there are too many changes. The situation of designing and constructing at the same time still exists. Various quotas and system regulations are not complete enough. We also lack experience in many large-scale constructions. However, on the other hand, it also shows that the concept of comprehensively completing the plan and the concept of economic accounting have not been universally established in various capital construction departments. Some construction units and construction enterprises often believe that as long as they can complete the capital construction tasks on schedule, they have fulfilled their responsibilities; and they do not pay attention to how to use funds economically. At the same time, there is a lack of strict financial supervision over the use of funds for capital construction, and financial discipline is not strictly enforced. The People's Construction Bank of China, which is specifically responsible for supervising the allocation of capital construction funds, has often failed to adhere to principles and launch serious, irreconcilable struggles against the phenomenon of wasting state funds in capital construction.
　　In order to ensure the smooth completion of the capital construction tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan, we must vigorously overcome the above shortcomings. Because the phenomenon of not valuing the economical use of funds in capital construction is fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of developing the national economy. If it is allowed to continue, it will seriously damage the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses, especially all employees of the capital construction department, to fight against the phenomenon of not valuing the economical use of funds, expose and report all acts of wasting state funds, so as to ensure the rational use of state construction funds.

### 厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！　反对浪费国家建设资金

　　厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
　　反对浪费国家建设资金
　　马南风
    目前基本建设中不重视节约使用资金和不重视经济核算的现象，是很普遍的。除去计划脱离实际、盲目兴建和设计错误所造成的浪费以外，主要还表现在以下几个方面：
      （一）设计预算普遍偏高。根据中国人民建设银行对四十九个建设单位一九五五年设计预算初步审查的结果，高估的部分平均占原预算总值的百分之九点六。其中汉口肉类联合加工厂护岸工程的设计预算，高估数达原预算的百分之二十九；草埠湖水闸工程的设计预算高估了百分之二十八点八一；梅山水库工程设计预算高估了百分之二十四点九二。
    由于设计预算偏高，施工单位的计划利润也就高过了国家规定的百分之二点五。高额利润掩盖了基本建设中的浪费损失。例如电业总局基本建设工程局第八工程公司承包太原第一发电厂工程，一九五四年在施工过程中虽然损失浪费了二百零六万元，最后仍然取得了计划利润和超计划利润一百零七万元。纺织工业部北京工程公司承包北京国棉二厂工程，获得的超额利润，占全年完成工作量的百分之九以上。华东水电安装公司一九五四年上半年的利润率竟达百分之三十二。其中除一部分是降低成本所得的外，绝大部分是由于设计预算偏高而获得的。许多建筑企业对于取得的利润又往往没有及时上缴，每年积压在各个施工单位的资金是一笔很大的数字。
    （二）资金使用计划性很差，造成许多积压和浪费。不少建设单位和建筑企业，在计划任务还没有确定以前，就开始大量购买材料，结果其中有很大一部分材料不能使用，只好堆存在仓库里。甘肃省文化局今年第一季度申请拨给水泥二百九十二吨，但根据确定的投资计划，全年只需要八十八吨。还有不少建设单位，违反财政制度，任意花费国家的资金。例如，江西某钨矿为了避免年终结余的资金上缴，买了许多不急需的工具、仪器、沙发、钢丝床，所买的沙发把办公室的家具全部搬空也摆不下。北京国棉一厂购买的花树，把厂内全部的空地都种上也种不下。有的建设单位和建筑企业还非法地进行计划以外的工程。例如友好森林管理局自行削减家属宿舍工程，修建了几座很漂亮的俱乐部，面积达一千六百平方公尺，结果有许多职工家属没有房子住。
    不重视节约使用资金的另一种表现是许多建设单位中内部资源很多，但没有充分动员。据对九个主管部门一九五五年财务收支计划（草案）的分析，一九五四年年底的结余资金总数相当于这九个主管部门一九五五年全年基本建设工作总量的百分之十七，而事实上可以动员的内部资源还不止此数。因为一九五五年财务收支计划，必须在一九五四年的财务决算还没有编出以前先行编报。结余资金数系按估计填列，一般偏低。据中国人民建设银行对北京、天津两地二十一个建设单位的检查，其中十四个单位一九五五年财务收支计划（草案）所列结余资金平均低于一九五四年财务决算数的百分之四十。这说明建设单位可以动员的内部资源潜力是很大的。
    资金过多的现象，在建筑企业中也同样存在。例如国家规定建筑企业的自有流动资金一般约占全年承包工作量的百分之十四。但据一九五四年十一月对一百四十一个建筑企业的统计，自有流动资金实有额平均超过定额百分之十七点五，其中最多的超过两倍以上。
      （三）不注意器材的保管和不珍惜使用器材的现象更为普遍。建筑工程部直属工程公司将八公尺长的木材约一万多立方公尺截作四公尺的短材使用，大材小用的钢材也有一千四百多吨。所属木工厂把价值六十元一车的好木材，按五元一车的价格当作“废木料”出售了二千二百五十五车，损失了十二万余元。辽宁省大伙房水库大坝工地在两个月中丢失各种工具五千多件。纺织工业部基本建设局工程公司的水泥，因保管不善而降低标号使用的达三千五百多吨。损失二万五千六百多元。每年在这些方面所浪费的资金，是十分惊人的。
    产生以上问题的原因是多方面的。首先是基本建设工作程序还不正常，计划和设计文件不能及时提出，而且变动太多，边设计、边施工的情况仍然存在；各项定额和制度规定也不够完备；对于许多规模巨大的建设，我们还缺乏经验。但另一方面也说明全面完成计划的观点和经济核算的观点还没有在各个基本建设部门中普遍建立起来。有些建设单位和建筑企业，往往认为只要能够按期完成基本建设任务，就算尽了自己的责任；而不注意如何珍惜地使用资金。同时，对于基本建设的资金运用，还缺乏严格的财政监督，财政纪律执行得不严格；专责办理基本建设拨款监督的中国人民建设银行，对基本建设中浪费国家资金的现象，也往往未能坚持原则，展开严肃的、不调和的斗争。
    为了保证第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设任务顺利地完成，就必须大力克服以上缺点。因为基本建设中不重视节约资金的现象是和发展国民经济的要求根本不相容的，如果任其继续下去，就会严重地损害国家和人民的利益。因此，必须发动广大群众、特别是基本建设部门的全体职工，向不重视节约使用资金的现象作斗争，揭发和检举一切浪费国家资金的行为，以保证国家建设资金的合理使用。
