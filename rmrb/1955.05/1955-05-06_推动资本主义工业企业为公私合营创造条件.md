　　Promote Conditions for Capitalist Industrial Enterprises to Transition to Joint Public-Private Ownership
　　Guan Datong
    Capitalist industry in our country generally possesses weaknesses such as being scattered and fragmented, having rudimentary equipment, backward technology, and weak capital. Coupled with the corruption and chaos of capitalist management methods, this creates many difficulties in the process of socialist transformation. In the past, joint public-private enterprises were mostly larger in scale, with better equipment and higher technology. In the future, joint ventures will gradually expand to secondary industries and small and medium-sized factories. Therefore, joint venture work will be more difficult and complex, and joint venture work must be prepared more thoroughly. This requires first, based on the needs of the state, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the willingness of capitalists, changing their backward situation to create conditions for joint public-private ownership.

    Based on the current situation and local experience, to prepare for joint ventures, in addition to implementing the state's policy of overall consideration and gradually arranging and transforming private industry by industry and strengthening the work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions in capitalist industrial enterprises, it is particularly important that under the unified leadership of local Party organizations and governments, relevant parties such as state-owned enterprise units, industrial and commercial administration, labor, and trade unions should closely coordinate and systematically do the following three aspects of work:

    First, strengthen production leadership and management of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales factories through the campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to past experience, the campaign to increase production and practice economy is not only an important method to ensure that private factories complete state processing and ordering tasks on time, with quality, and in quantity, but also an important step to promote the internal transformation of private industry. The campaign to increase production and practice economy mainly focuses on "improving enterprise management, saving raw materials, improving product quality, and reducing costs." Since the second quarter of 1954, according to statistics from twelve large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Nanjing, more than 2,400 private factories have launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy and have achieved significant results. For example, after forty-nine private textile processing factories in Beijing launched a production increase and economy campaign in the fourth quarter of last year, the average defect rate of cloth decreased by 5.7 percentage points, and first-class products increased from 84.4 percent to 90.1 percent. In Shanghai's private rubber industry, as a result of promoting synthetic rubber, recycled rubber, and improving operating methods and product specifications, 395 tons of natural rubber can be saved throughout the year. These rubbers can be made into 28,000 tires or more than 166,000 pairs of rubber boots; other industries have also achieved good results in saving copper, cotton, coal, and electricity. Due to the reduction of product costs, employees of private factories in Shanghai assisted processing and ordering departments in reducing labor costs for 4,000 kinds of products, saving the state more than 30 million yuan. At the same time, enterprise management can also be improved. According to a survey of fifty-nine private factories in Shanghai and Beijing, they generally established or improved management systems based on actual needs and specific circumstances, formulated production and financial plans, gradually overcame the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible, and strengthened the planning of production. Many factories also discuss and decide on major issues in production through production increase and economy committees or labor-capital consultation meetings, gradually realizing democratic management of enterprises, and also strengthening the balance of completing state processing and ordering tasks.

    Of course, enterprises engaged in processing and ordering are still owned by capitalists, and the management of the enterprises is still capitalist. In these enterprises, the socialist component and the capitalist component are generally only related to the outside of the enterprise. Therefore, there must be certain limits on the production relations of the enterprise and the ideological transformation of the capitalists. However, through the form of processing and ordering, the ties between capitalist industry and capitalist commerce and consumers are cut off externally, and the campaign to increase production and practice economy internally helps prepare conditions for a gradual transition to a higher form of state capitalism.

    Second, steadily guiding capitalist medium-sized and small industrial enterprises to carry out factory consolidation and combination work according to the needs of the state and the possibilities of the enterprises themselves is also an important step in the transformation of private industry. Most of China's capitalist medium-sized and small factories cannot produce independently and can only carry out some production processes or manufacture some parts, with interdependent cooperative relations with large factories or other medium-sized and small factories. However, they still play a certain positive role in producing and supplying daily necessities needed by the people and maintaining labor employment, and they are still a force that cannot be ignored in our national economy. Therefore, under the unified plan of the state, organizing capitalist medium-sized and small industries in a guided manner through various forms of factory consolidation and combination, and appropriately adopting methods such as "large enterprises leading small enterprises" and "advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises" to organize the merger of capitalist medium-sized and small factories with the same type of work or with cooperative relations in production and sequential processes, so that they can learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, gradually move from decentralization to centralization, and gradually change backward enterprises into advanced ones through reform, which is more convenient for joint public-private ownership. According to local experience, it is generally better to carry out mergers with large factories leading small factories. On the contrary, if many scattered and backward small factories are concentrated, capitalists without experience in managing large factories are likely to create greater difficulties. For example, Beijing Chaoyang Electromechanical Manufacturing Factory was formed in 1952 by merging eleven medium-sized and small factories based on Yihua, Beijing, and other five factories. Originally, each factory had incomplete production processes. After the merger and reform, it became a comprehensive factory that can undertake the manufacture of complete sets of machines. From the fourth quarter of 1953, it completely undertook state processing and ordering tasks and was approved to implement joint public-private ownership in May 1954.

    The factory consolidation and combination work of capitalist medium-sized and small industries is an important part of production reorganization and must be combined with the unified arrangement of the production of private industry and the transformation of industries, and must be carried out in a guided and step-by-step manner according to the state's plan. It is necessary to prevent coercion, commandism, rashness, and blind mergers. Before the merger, the selection of targets should be based on detailed investigation and research, and should be fully deliberated and consulted between the capitalist sides and between the labor side and the capitalist side. The property valuation, personnel arrangements, salary and benefits, technical equipment, capital turnover, production plans, and supply and sales issues before and after the merger must be carefully studied and resolved according to the specific circumstances; and capitalists must be prevented from taking the opportunity to "throw away burdens" and withdraw funds.

    Third, strengthen the education of industrial capitalists and promote them to actively operate and accept transformation. After studying the state's general task during the transition period and the Constitution, as well as the practical education of the development of state capitalism in recent years, more and more industrial capitalists have improved their ideological understanding, seen the general trend, and realized the benefits of joint public-private ownership from actual economic life and political life, recognized the future of enterprises and individuals, obeyed leadership, actively operated, and applied for or strived for joint public-private ownership. This phenomenon is very good. However, there are still many people with confused or wrong ideas that hinder the progress of enterprise transformation, which needs to be criticized and educated well. Some capitalists still hold a passive and dependent attitude, are not responsible for improving enterprise management, and think that "increasing production and practicing economy is the workers' business, let the workers do it," and put themselves aside and stand by. This passive attitude is not conducive to enterprise transformation, not conducive to the personal transformation of capitalists, and not conducive to the socialist construction of the country. Premier Zhou pointed out in the government work report that in the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, "on the one hand, we must transform capitalist enterprises so that they eventually become advanced socialist enterprises; on the other hand, we must also transform the thinking of capitalists and capitalist agents, and try our best to enable them to play an active and beneficial role in the process of socialist transformation." Capitalists should realize that combining enterprise transformation to study new things and new management methods is precisely the way to personal transformation. Some capitalists of medium-sized and small industries believe that their factories have already accepted processing and ordering and do not have to worry about having no work to do, so they are unwilling to engage in joint ventures and try to freely control the enterprise as in the past. This is obviously also wrong. They should be helped to analyze and criticize, improve their understanding, and further create conditions to strive for joint public-private ownership. Some believe that only large-scale enterprises with a good foundation have the conditions for joint public-private ownership, and their own enterprises are small in scale and have a poor foundation, and do not have the conditions for joint public-private ownership. For such people, it must also be pointed out to them that socialist transformation is carried out gradually. Under the state's overall arrangements and the policy of transforming industries and trades separately, as long as they actively prepare, create conditions, and accept transformation, it is possible to be included in the track of joint public-private ownership. In addition, if certain capitalists resist socialist transformation and disobey the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of employees, and continue to violate laws and engage in sabotage after being educated but not repenting, they should be sanctioned by national law.

    Our country has adopted a policy of overall consideration for capitalist industry and commerce under the premise of ensuring the continuous and steady growth of the socialist economy, and has made reasonable arrangements. This provides more favorable conditions for the transformation of capitalist industry. We must take various measures, rely on the masses of employees, and fully use social forces and the organizations of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association to actively promote capitalist industry to improve production and improve management, create conditions for expanding joint public-private ownership, and gradually complete the socialist transformation task of capitalist industry in the country during the transition period.

　　推动资本主义工业企业为公私合营创造条件
　　管大同
    我国资本主义工业一般存在着分散零星、设备简陋、技术落后、资金薄弱等弱点，加以资本主义经营管理方式的腐败和混乱，这就使它们在进行社会主义改造过程中发生很多困难。过去实行公私合营的多是规模较大、设备较好、技术较高的企业。今后合营企业则将逐步扩展到次要行业和中小型工厂。因而合营工作将更为困难和复杂，合营工作也就必须更有准备地进行。这就是必须首先根据国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿，改变它们的落后情况，为公私合营创造条件。
    根据目前情况和各地经验，要为合营作好准备工作，除了贯彻国家统筹兼顾、逐行逐业进行安排和改造私营工业的方针以及加强对资本主义工业企业的党、团、工会工作以外，特别是要在各地党组织和政府的统一领导下，使国营企业单位、工商行政、劳动、工会等各个有关方面密切配合，有计划、有步骤地做好以下三方面的工作：
    第一，通过增产节约运动，加强对加工、订货、统购、包销工厂的生产领导和管理工作。根据过去的经验，增产节约运动不仅是保证私营工厂按期、按质、按量完成国家加工订货任务的重要办法，也是推动私营工业进行内部改造的重要步骤。增产节约运动主要是以“改善企业经营管理，节约原材料，提高产品质量，降低成本”为内容。一九五四年第二季度以来，据北京、天津、南京等十二个大中城市统计，已有二千四百多家私营工厂开展了增产节约运动，并取得了显著的成绩。如北京市私营纺织业四十九家加工厂，去年第四季度开展增产节约竞赛后，残次布率平均降低了百分之五点七，甲等品从百分之八十四点四提高到百分之九十点一。上海市私营橡胶业由于推广人造胶、再生胶及改进操作方法和产品规格的结果，全年可节约天然胶三百九十五吨，这些橡胶可以制成轮胎二万八千只或胶靴十六万六千余打；其他行业节约铜料、棉花、煤、电等方面也都有良好的成绩，由于产品成本降低，上海市私营工厂职工协助加工订货部门降低了四千种产品的工缴，为国家节省了三千多万元。同时，企业的经营管理也可以得到改善。据上海、北京两市对五十九家私营工厂调查，它们一般都根据实际需要和具体情况，建立或健全了管理制度，制定了生产、财务计划，逐步克服了无人负责的混乱现象，加强了生产的计划性。许多工厂并通过增产节约委员会或劳资协商会议讨论决定生产中的重大问题，逐步实现了企业的民主管理，也加强了完成国家加工订货任务的均衡性。
    当然，加工订货的企业仍属资本家所有，企业的经营管理仍是资本主义方式，在这些企业里，社会主义成分和资本主义成分一般还只是在企业外部的联系，因而在企业的生产关系和资本家的思想改造方面，就不能不受到一定的限制。但是经过加工订货的形式，在企业外部切断了资本主义工业同资本主义商业和消费者的联系，在企业内部通过开展增产节约运动，就有利于准备条件，逐步向国家资本主义的高级形式过渡。
    第二，依据国家的需要和企业本身的可能，稳步地引导资本主义中、小工业企业进行并厂组合工作，也是改造私营工业的一项重要步骤。我国的资本主义中、小型厂，大多不能独立生产，只能进行一部分工序生产或制造一些零件，同大型工厂或其他中、小工厂存在着依存协作关系。但它们目前在生产和供应人民生活需要的日用品方面和维持劳动就业方面还有一定的积极作用，在我国国民经济中还是一项不可忽视的力量。为此，在国家统一的计划下，有领导地通过各种并厂组合形式来组织资本主义中、小工业，适当地采取“以大带小”“以先进带落后”的办法，使同工种的或生产上有协作关系、工序衔接的资本主义中、小工厂组织合并起来，使其取长补短，由分散逐步走向集中，使企业经过改革逐步地变落后为先进，这就更便利于进行公私合营。根据各地经验，一般以大厂带小厂的方式进行合并是比较好的。相反，如果由许多分散落后的小厂集中起来，资本家如无经营大厂经验，就容易造成更大的困难。例如北京市朝阳机电制造厂，在一九五二年以艺华、北京等五厂为基础，共十一户中、小厂合并组成。原来各厂都是生产工序不全，合并后经过改革，成为一座全能厂，可以承制成套的机器，一九五三年第四季度起，全部承接国家加工订货，并在一九五四年五月经批准实行公私合营。
    资本主义中、小工业的并厂组合工作，是生产改组中的一项重要内容，必须结合统一安排私营工业的生产和行业的改造，根据国家的计划有领导有步骤地去进行，必须防止强迫命令、急躁冒进和盲目合并。在合并前，选择对象要经过详细的调查研究，并在资方同资方和劳方同资方之间充分酝酿协商，合并前后的财产清估、人事安排、工资待遇、技术设备、资金周转、生产计划和供产销等各方面的问题，都必须根据具体情况妥善研究解决；并防止资本家借机“丢包袱”和抽逃资金等行为。
    第三，加强对工业资本家的教育，推动他们积极经营，接受改造。经过学习国家过渡时期的总任务和宪法以后，以及几年来国家资本主义发展的实践教育，已有越来越多的工业资本家提高了思想认识，看清了大势，并从实际经济生活和政治生活中体会到公私合营的好处，认清了企业和个人的前途，服从领导，积极经营，申请或争取公私合营，这种现象是很好的。但目前也还有不少人存在着糊涂或错误的思想，阻碍企业改造的进展，需要很好地加以批判和教育。有些资本家仍抱消极依赖的态度，对改善企业经营管理不负责任，认为“增产节约是工人的事，让工人去搞”，“资方不搞政府也会帮助的”，把自己置身事外，袖手旁观。这种消极态度对企业改造不利，对资本家个人改造不利，对国家社会主义建设也是不利的。周总理在政府工作报告中曾指出，在对资本主义工商业进行改造过程中，“一方面，我们要改造资本主义企业使它们最后成为先进的社会主义企业；另一方面，我们还要改造资本家和资本家代理人的思想，尽可能使他们在社会主义改造过程中起积极的有益的作用。”应该使资本家认识到，结合企业的改造来努力学习新事物和新的经营管理方法，正是个人改造的途径。有些中、小工业的资本家认为自己的工厂已经接受加工订货，不愁没有活做，因而不愿合营，企图像过去一样，自由地支配企业。这显然也是错误的。应当帮助他们进行分析批判，提高认识，进一步创造条件，争取公私合营。有的认为有公私合营条件的只是规模较大、基础较好的企业，自己企业规模小、基础差，没有条件实行公私合营。对这类人，也必须向他们指出，社会主义改造工作是逐步进行的，在国家统筹安排、分行分业进行改造的方针下，只要积极做好准备，创造条件，接受改造，就有可能纳入公私合营的轨道。此外，对某些资本家抗拒社会主义改造，不服从国营经济的领导和职工的监督等行为，如果经过教育尚不悔改，而继续违法破坏的，应当给以国家法律的制裁。
    我们国家在保证社会主义经济不断稳步增长的前提下，对资本主义工商业采取了统筹兼顾的政策，进行合理的安排。这就给资本主义工业的改造提供了更有利的条件。我们必须采取各种办法，依靠职工群众并充分运用社会力量和工商业联合会、民主建国会的组织，来积极地推动资本主义工业改进生产和改善经营管理，为扩展公私合营工作创造条件，以逐步完成国家在过渡时期对资本主义工业的社会主义改造任务。
