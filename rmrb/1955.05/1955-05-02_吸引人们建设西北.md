Newspaper Review:

　　Attracting People to Build the Northwest
    In the past, the reactionary rulers always described the Northwest as a desolate and impoverished area. Today, this influence still hinders some people from actively engaging in construction there. Newspapers have a responsibility to eliminate this erroneous influence and encourage more people to build the Northwest.
    The letters from the geological exploration team published in the Gansu Daily on March 26 were a very good piece of publicity. One letter, expressing the common aspirations of young geological exploration workers, said: "From a beautiful geological map, we see the rich underground treasures of the motherland and the happy socialist future." All the members of the women's surveying team said in their letter that they loved the Gobi Desert because there was oil needed by the motherland underground. Through these letters, people see the young builders' love for the motherland and their love for construction, and see that the Northwest of the motherland has abundant resources, and that working and living there is glorious and meaningful. These letters also describe how they overcame difficulties and dangers and lived a hard and happy life. Every letter is filled with an optimistic spirit of hard work. The Communist Youth League branch in a geological team in the Gobi Desert said in a letter that their team members would build human ladders to climb up cliffs when they encountered them; when they encountered snow water that had converged into rapid rivers, they would cross them hand in hand. Despite the many difficulties in their work, they still overfulfilled their tasks. Geologists marching on the snow-capped mountains of the Qilian Mountains, 3,000 meters above sea level, told readers in their letter: "In every corner of the Qilian Mountains, you can hear our joyful songs." The Gansu Daily also reported on April 23 in a prominent position the welcome of the Lanzhou youth organizations to the young people who came to the Northwest to participate in construction. This is also a strong encouragement for people participating in the construction of the Northwest.
    Now, the motherland needs more people to go to the Northwest and turn the Northwest into our future industrial base. Newspapers must work hard for this great goal. It is good that Gansu Daily has paid attention to this aspect of publicity. Newspapers in various places should use various methods to carry out this kind of publicity and mobilization frequently to encourage people to enthusiastically participate in the construction of the inland and border areas of the motherland.　(Zu Shu)

　　吸引人们建设西北
    过去反动统治者一直把西北说成是荒凉贫瘠的地区。在今天，这种影响也还妨碍着一部分人积极地去那里从事建设。报纸有责任来消除这种错误的影响，鼓舞更多的人去建设西北。
    甘肃日报在三月二十六日发表的几封来自地质勘探队的信件，就是一次很好的宣传。在一封表达着青年地质勘探工作者共同愿望的信中说：“从一张美丽的地质图中，我们看到了祖国丰富的地下宝藏和幸福的社会主义前景。”女子测量队的全体青年团员，在信中说她们很爱戈壁滩，因为那里的地下有祖国需要的石油。通过这些信，人们看到了青年建设者们热爱祖国、热爱建设的心情，看到了祖国西北有着丰富的资源，在那里工作和生活是光荣而有意义的。这些信还描绘了他们如何战胜困难和危险，过着艰苦愉快生活的情景。每封信里都洋溢着乐观的艰苦奋斗精神。戈壁滩上一支地质队中的团支部在信中说，他们那里的队员，碰到悬崖便搭成人梯爬上去；遇见汇成急流大河的雪水，就手拉着手涉过去。尽管工作中的困难多，他们还是超额完成了任务。在祁连山拔海三千公尺的雪山上行进的地质队员们，在信中告诉读者：“祁连山的各个角落里，都能听到我们欢乐的歌声。”甘肃日报还在四月二十三日的显著地位，报道了兰州市青年团体对到西北参加建设的青年们的欢迎情况。这对于参加西北建设的人们也是一种有力的鼓舞。
    现在，祖国需要更多的人到西北去，把西北变成我们未来的工业基地。报纸要为这个伟大目的而努力。甘肃日报已注意了这方面宣传是好的，各地报纸都应当运用各种方式经常进行这种宣传和动员，鼓舞人们热情地参加祖国内地和边疆的建设。　（祖树）
