　  Jianggou Agricultural Machinery Station Begins Contract Farming
    Hubei Province's first agricultural machinery station—Xiangyang County's Jianggou Agricultural Machinery Station—has formally begun providing contract farming services to surrounding farmers. This year, the station signed contract farming agreements with fourteen agricultural producers' cooperatives, contracting to farm a total of 5,000 mu of land, accounting for 50 percent of the total cultivated land area of these fourteen agricultural producers' cooperatives. Currently, the various agricultural producers' cooperatives are clearing obstacles in the fields in preparation for machine farming.
    Since its establishment in November 1954, this agricultural machinery station helped the agricultural producers' cooperatives overcome the difficulties of drought, hard soil, and difficulty in sowing in the northern Xiangyang area during trial farming. It rush-planted 500 mu of wheat and beans, fully demonstrating the superiority of machine farming. Therefore, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have requested contract farming services. To meet the needs of the farmers, the station plans to gradually expand the contract farming area to 150,000 mu in the next five years.

　  姜沟农业机器站开始代耕
    湖北省第一个农业机器站——襄阳县姜沟农业机器站正式开始为周围农民代耕。这个站今年和十四个农业生产合作社订了代耕合同，共代耕五千亩田，占这十四个农业生产合作社总耕地面积百分之五十。现在，各农业生产合作社正在清除田间障碍，为机器耕种进行准备。
    这个农业机器站从一九五四年十一月建立后，在试耕中就帮助农业生产合作社克服了当时襄阳北部地区天旱、地硬和难于播种的困难，抢种了五百亩的小麦和豆类，充分显示了机器耕田的优越性，因此，许多农业生产合作社都纷纷要求代耕。为了适应农民的要求，该站计划在今后五年内将逐步扩大代耕面积到十五万亩。
