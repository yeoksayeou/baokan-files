Ye Shengtao's Speech

    Now, things are very clear. Hu Feng's problem is not just that he made mistakes in ideology and theory; Hu Feng's main problem is that he has been carrying out criminal anti-Party and anti-people activities.

    The letters from Hu Feng to Shu Wu disclosed in the newspaper on the 13th of this month are already infuriating enough. The large batch of his letters disclosed in the newspaper on the 24th is even more infuriating. After reading Hu Feng's letters, we know that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Hu Feng has been issuing orders to his lackeys. Hu Feng instructed his lackeys to infiltrate the Party, infiltrate people's organizations, establish strongholds, gather information, steal documents, collect materials, accumulate strength, and actively prepare for a frenzied attack on the Party and the people's government. Recently, the Hu Feng clique's all-out offensive completely failed, and Hu Feng hurriedly made arrangements to have his lackeys make false self-criticisms, temporarily retreat across the board, and wait for an opportunity to counterattack.

    This kind of double-dealing conspiracy is no different from the Trotskyites described in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Their goals are also the same, which is to subvert the people's government and restore the counter-revolutionary regime. Looking at the recently published "Literary Gazette," from Mr. Cao Yu's article, we know that Taiwan's radio has already cheered Hu Feng's "courageous" offensive. This makes us even more aware that the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique are completely consistent with the criminal activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies.

    We must purge Hu Feng.

    I fully agree to expel Hu Feng from the membership, remove all of Hu Feng's positions, and suggest that Sichuan Province revoke his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress. The organization and criminal activities of the Hu Feng clique must continue to be investigated until the truth comes out and is completely clarified.

Xia Yan's Speech

    Thoroughly exposing the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique from our revolutionary literary and artistic ranks is a great victory for our revolutionary cause. This is equivalent to cutting off a deadly tumor from our body.

    This tumor has been growing on us for more than twenty years. Looking at the materials that have now been exposed, and recalling the past, we are really too numb and lack a sense of enemy.

    For more than twenty years, haven't we noticed at all in the thoughts and words of Hu Feng and his faction that they are opposing Marxism and opposing the Party's literary and artistic policy? It should be said that we have long noticed, recognized, and fought against it; haven't we felt at all that the actions and styles of this faction are secretive, cunning, and abnormal? It should be said that many people have felt it and always found it difficult to understand; haven't we always suspected Hu Feng's political background? It should also be said that we have long suspected it. We suspected it before the War of Resistance against Japan, we suspected it during the Chongqing period, and we have been suspecting it ever since he spoke at the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association last year. The problem is not whether we have suspected it or fought against it, but that we lack sufficient political vigilance and have not thoroughly understood the political essence of this faction, so until recently, we have always regarded them only as ideological dissidents, and have not recognized that they are the most insidious political enemies cleverly hidden in our ranks.

    Now, under the leadership and help of the Party Central Committee, the counter-revolutionary essence of this anti-Party clique has finally been exposed in front of the broad masses of people. Recognizing the nature of this reactionary clique and seeing the harm of this reactionary clique to the revolutionary cause, we have more courage and determination to thoroughly solve this problem and remove this reactionary clique from our ranks.

    For more than twenty years, we have really been deceived and misled for too long. Due to the lack of due political sensitivity and a high degree of vigilance against class enemies, we have allowed Hu Feng to "contact people," "win over people," and "engage in pioneering work," and even allowed them to use Liu Xuewei, Peng Baishan, and other Party cadres who served in cultural and educational propaganda work in Shanghai, as well as important publishing institutions such as the New Literature and Art Publishing House, to carry out criminal anti-Party and anti-people activities, which has caused great damage to our revolutionary cause.

    The reason why Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique have been able to hide in the revolutionary camp for a long time and carry out various conspiracies is mainly due to the following characteristics: First, they wear the cloak of Marxism, use Marxist language to oppose Marxism, and use the posture of supporting the Communist Party to oppose the Communist Party; Second, they have a complete set of anti-Party and anti-people political programs and action programs, and have a very meticulous strategic and tactical deployment when carrying out this kind of counter-revolutionary activity; Third, they use extremely secret methods to form a well-organized and very cunning reactionary clique, and there are even a few Party cadres in this clique. They use this vicious method to confuse us, paralyze us, and drill into our vital areas to disintegrate and destroy us from within. The tumor grows inside our body, and the poisonous snake coils around us.

    What is particularly shocking to us in this struggle is that every time the Hu Feng reactionary clique launches an attack on the Party and the revolutionary literary and art cause, they cleverly use the shortcomings and mistakes in our thinking and work. He took advantage of our carelessness and lack of vigilance in the fierce class struggle, our lack of ability to distinguish class enemies, and he took advantage of the liberalism, individualism, detachment from political tendencies, and certain disunity in our literary and art ranks. Class enemies have not slept for a moment, they are painstakingly looking for all exploitable
  "breaches," they are "sharpening my sword and watching the direction." Here, I am reminded of a sentence by the great Czechoslovak warrior Fuchik:
  "People, I love you. You must be vigilant!" This is an extremely profound warning to us.

    The conspiracies of Hu Feng and his reactionary clique have been exposed, and the true face of this reactionary clique has been largely revealed, but during the period of socialist transformation, the class struggle will only become more intense and sharper. We must draw sufficient experience and lessons from this struggle, strengthen the study of Marxism, earnestly implement the Party's literary and artistic policy, raise vigilance, strengthen unity, and improve our work to ensure the great victories we have already achieved and will achieve.

    Finally, I fully agree with the suggestions of many comrades to expel Hu Feng from the Writers Association, remove all his positions in literary and art organizations, and suggest revoking his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress.

Ziya's Speech

    Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique's activities of spreading bourgeois idealism in literature and their anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies are being exposed to the people of the whole country today. This is another great victory in the struggle of the people of the whole country against bourgeois ideology. The tide of this struggle has once again sobered our minds politically and ideologically, and further armed our ranks.

    The literary and art workers of the thirteen nationalities in Xinjiang, together with the literary and art workers of the whole country, are resolutely fighting against Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique. This is also our obligation to the Party and the people.

    The reactionary essence of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique shows that they are not only enemies of literary and art workers, but also common enemies of all ethnic groups in our country. When we heard about the anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, we felt very angry, and felt that their conspiracies were a great crime in our great socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

    But we know that the Chinese revolution was consolidated, developed, and won victory in the long-term struggle with various enemies under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country have been liberated, and the interests of our Party are consistent with the interests of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Therefore, our Party is invincible. It leads the people of the whole country to be able to defeat all enemies, and today it has once again defeated the activities of the Hu Feng clique. Because we have the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Marxism-Leninism guides all our actions, our cause will always be victorious!

    Under the leadership of the Party, the literary and art workers of all our ethnic groups will be more united, raise our vigilance and give the various saboteurs who have infiltrated our ranks the punishment they deserve, and wash them out of our ranks.

    Finally, on behalf of the literary and art workers of the thirteen nationalities in Xinjiang, I suggest that Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress and all positions in the literary and art circles be revoked.

Feng Xuefeng's Speech

    Due to the publication of Shu Wu's materials exposing Hu Feng in the "People's Daily" on May 13, and the publication of a batch of Hu Feng's secret letters on the 24th, Hu Feng and his clique's anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies and evil activities have been fully revealed. These materials are sufficient to prove that Hu Feng's behavior is counter-revolutionary and that his clique is a conspiratorial organization engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

    This is an event that has shaken the whole country. Anyone who stands on the side of the people cannot but be angry, hate, and shudder. For more than twenty years, we have been deceived, and I personally may have been deceived even more, especially before liberation. Hu Feng infiltrated the revolutionary camp around 1933, when he participated in the activities of the "Left League" (Left-Wing Writers League). I was also in Shanghai at that time, but I did not see through his hypocrisy. Later, I left Shanghai and returned to Shanghai for work in the summer of 1936. Looking back now, Hu Feng was obviously engaged in splitting activities within the revolutionary literary and art circles at that time. The main thing is that Shanghai at that time was under white terror, and it was very difficult for Mr. Lu Xun to contact the masses and underground Communist Party members. Hu Feng took advantage of this difficult condition and some shortcomings in our work to carry out divisive activities in front of Mr. Lu Xun. First of all, he wanted to undermine the unity and cooperation between Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Mao Dun, and secondly, he wanted to provoke the relationship between Mr. Lu Xun and Party writers—such as Comrade Zhou Yang and Comrade Xia Yan, who were in Shanghai at that time—in an attempt to pull Mr. Lu Xun away from the close relationship with our Party and make him a capital for realizing his personal ambitions. Of course, Hu Feng's attempt did not succeed, because the solid relationship between Mr. Lu Xun and our Party could not be destroyed by any reactionary's divisive activities; however, Hu Feng's bad behavior also played a role, causing some disputes in the literary and art circles at that time, bringing some losses to the work, and making Mr. Lu Xun, who was ill at that time, feel unhappy for a while. When I arrived in Shanghai, it was precisely when Mr. Lu Xun was very unhappy. At that time, I felt that his unhappiness was related to some disputes within the revolutionary literary and art circles. But what made Mr. Lu Xun most unhappy was that in June 1936, counter-revolutionary traitor Trotskyite elements wrote letters and sent publications to Mr. Lu Xun, and Mr. Lu Xun immediately gave the Trotskyites a fierce public blow. However, in the meantime, Mr. Lu Xun told me that some people in the revolutionary literary and art circles had tried to slander him as a Trotskyite because he had not joined the "Literary and Art Workers Association" (a progressive writers' group newly established in Shanghai in early 1936 after the automatic dissolution of the "Left League"), and that this was what Hu Feng had told him. Mr. Lu Xun was obviously unhappy at that time, and it was also related to this kind of thing; but at that time, I only reported this situation and the fact that the Trotskyites conspired to insult Mr. Lu Xun to the Party, and did not investigate how the words Mr. Lu Xun had heard came about, and of course, I would not suspect that Hu Feng had any intention of telling Mr. Lu Xun about this kind of thing. But looking back today, I really can't help but wonder where this kind of vicious rumor came from. Looking at the tricks of Hu Feng's conspiracy that have been exposed now, at least it can be concluded that Hu Feng was engaged in divisive activities. This kind of means both hurt Mr. Lu Xun's feelings and was obviously a political sabotage behavior. Looking back, I feel shuddered.

    Hu Feng used the fact that he had been close to Mr. Lu Xun as capital. But as everyone has already understood, he did not really respect Mr. Lu Xun, and was even less moved by Mr. Lu Xun's great revolutionary spirit of sacrificing everything to serve the people; he only attempted to use Mr. Lu Xun as a means for him to achieve his personal ambitions and anti-people activities, thereby insulting and destroying Mr. Lu Xun, because Mr. Lu Xun is the glory of the people. Hu Feng insisted on saying in public articles that Mr. Lu Xun was a Marxist from the beginning. This is by no means just Hu Feng's theoretical anti-historicism error, but intentionally degrading Mr. Lu Xun's greatness, which is also in line with Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people intentions. But the great Mr. Lu Xun can never be stained and used by any despicable and filthy counter-revolutionary elements. At that time, Mr. Lu Xun did not discover Hu Feng's vile behavior, which was not Mr. Lu Xun's fault, and we were all not vigilant at that time. In fact, Mr. Lu Xun had also suspected Hu Feng before his death. Mr. Xu Guangping later told others, and also told me, that Mr. Lu Xun had talked to her about Hu Feng with a suspicious attitude, saying: "I really can't figure out what kind of person Hu Feng is. When he comes here, he always says that this is not good and that is not good..." Speaking of me personally, according to what Mr. Xu Guangping later told me, Hu Feng had also slandered me in front of Mr. Lu Xun; it can be seen that Hu Feng not only wanted to alienate Mr. Lu Xun from comrades Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others, but also wanted to alienate the relationship between Mr. Lu Xun and me, because we are all Party members, and our approach to Mr. Lu Xun is primarily built on the basis of the relationship between the Party and Mr. Lu Xun.

    But I did not suspect and be vigilant at that time, and was completely deceived. Later, in Chongqing during the late period of the War of Resistance, and in Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance, I did not realize that he was a scheming anti-Party and anti-people element wearing a mask. Of course, I also felt his arrogance and various manifestations of extreme individualism more and more every day, and sometimes felt that he was simply like a bully; at the same time, I also felt that there was an extremely dark side in his thoughts and feelings, as if the increasing approach of the nationwide victory of the revolution was unfavorable to him. But I only thought that this was a manifestation of his individualistic thoughts and the reflection of the consciousness of the declining class in him, and always thought that he was always following us politically, and that the wrong thoughts and consciousness, as well as the wrong views on literary and artistic theory, would be corrected under the political premise and the criticism of comrades. But I was completely wrong. This shows that my political vigilance was very poor, my combativeness was very weak, and I was simply paralyzed. Now it is completely clear that Hu Feng insisted on his anti-Marxist literary and artistic theory on the premise of his anti-Party and anti-people political stance, and the psychology of the declining class that he sometimes revealed (as he showed in his later ugly work "Time Has Begun") is also consistent with the dark thoughts in his heart that cannot be told to others. After liberation, due to his stubborn attitude of adhering to the wrong theory, I often associated it with his revealed dark psychology, which sometimes aroused my suspicion of him, but I still never thought that he would carry out organized evil activities against the Party and the people in such a vicious and insidious way. It should be pointed out here how our lack of vigilance facilitated the long-term ambush of class alien elements; this is a lesson that should be remembered at all times. But of course, on the one hand, this also shows that we have always treated Hu Feng with a spirit of goodwill and unity.

    Unexpectedly, he is an enemy of the people! An enemy who has been endangering the people, the Party, and the people's literary and art cause led by the Party for a long time with vicious means and conspiracies! We can no longer fail to raise our vigilance and recognize the harm of hidden counter-revolutionary elements wearing masks. He is much more insidious than open enemies. Who would have thought that Hu Feng, who had claimed to be "struggling" under the "Party's political program" for more than twenty years, has been constantly using "smiles" wrapped in humiliation, "cluster grenades," and "whips" of "rubber-wrapped steel wire" to deal with us? Countless comrades have been brutally beaten by enemy agents in reactionary prisons, and countless comrades have been killed. At that time, we knew who the enemy was; but Hu Feng and his clique harmed us by our side, and before they were exposed, we really didn't know who the enemy was. The so-called double-dealer is good at using the false side to cover up the insidious side of harming people. We must learn from the exposure of Hu Feng's conspiracy the experience of recognizing hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    The exposure of the Hu Feng clique's conspiracy shows the intensity and sharpness of the current class struggle. This clique's anti-Party and anti-people activities are by no means just against some comrades in our literary and art work, nor are they just their so-called sectarian activities in the literary and art circles; this is a counter-revolutionary attack on the revolution. The exposure of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary conspiracies should not be taken to mean that the harmfulness of Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary and art theory has been reduced; on the contrary, it just proves the harmfulness of his reactionary theory even more. It is necessary to continue to fight against Hu Feng's reactionary theory, as well as Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts and all reactionary thoughts. Hu Feng and his clique used Hu Feng's literary and art theory, which was cloaked in "Marxism" but practiced anti-Marxism, as a weapon. In the era of people's revolution, counter-revolutionary political activities must be cloaked in progressive "theoretical" cloaks, spreading reactionary ideas under the cover of cloaks; at the same time, this kind of element that adopts double-dealing means, carries out the propaganda of reactionary ideas, and always adheres to the anti-people stance, will inevitably develop into counter-revolutionary political activities.

    It is completely clear that Hu Feng and his clique have developed into counter-revolutionary political conspiracies.

    Comrades, we must attach importance to the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique, and we must continue to thoroughly investigate them, and we must completely expose and eliminate this conspiracy activity. We must attach importance to the experience and lessons of this incident, raise our vigilance, and eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in all aspects of us. Although they are a very small number, the danger is extremely great!

    Today's meeting should make a resolution, first of all to cleanse Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association, remove all his positions, and recommend that the government deal with it according to law; at the same time, it should call on writers and literary and art workers across the country to unite more closely and strive to completely smash this counter-revolutionary conspiracy organization.

Bao Chang's Speech

    I am a young literary and art worker in Tianjin. In the past few years, I have personally seen how rampant the Hu Feng elements in the Tianjin literary and art circles have been in carrying out sectarian activities, how recklessly they have resisted the organization, and spread remarks against the organization; I have seen how the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee criticized and educated them in the past, and how arrogantly they resisted these criticisms and education, and I have also seen their corruption and degeneration, making the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles (hereinafter referred to as the "Federation of Literary and Art Circles") smoky. Comrades! I have a lot to say. I want to file my complaint here, I accuse the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique of their anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary criminal activities in Tianjin.

    First of all, I want to mention the spread of Hu Feng's thought in Tianjin. As everyone knows, since 1950, A Long, one of the most important core members of the Hu Feng clique, came to Tianjin. He served as a member of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He edited the organ publication of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Although he did not hold many social positions, he used every opportunity to carry out reactionary propaganda. His reactionary articles such as "On Tendency" were all published in Tianjin; he also published hundreds of thousands of words of works such as "Poetry and Reality," "What is Poetry," and "The Character of Writers and the Creation of Characters"; he also lectured at Nankai University and at the Workers' Amateur Art School. He frantically carried out anti-Marxist propaganda. The reactionary fallacies of "art is politics" and "the content of life is the content of thought" were all his "masterpieces" in Tianjin. What did he tell our workers? What "life is a chain, don't consider grabbing which link, you grab any link, the whole chain will be grabbed"; what "soldiers always find the nearest enemy to fight, writing is the same, write about the life closest to you"! "When writing about landlords, use the eyes of peasants to write, when writing about peasants, use the eyes of landlords"; "There are no good works after liberation, they are all descriptions of technical processes," and so on, are such reactionary thoughts. What did he tell our students? "Poetry is the expression of people's subjective feelings," "poetry is feeling," and so on, are these wrong arguments. And some other members of the Hu Feng clique—Lu Dian, Lu Li, and others—also tried their best to promote Hu Feng's thought. They organized creation seminars in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and vigorously promoted the fallacy of "life is everywhere" at the meeting. They also wrote poems, saying in their poems: "Poets of the times! Please write poems like this, write about our daily lives: write about every bit of our lives." They also emphasized "subjective fighting spirit," completely denying the role of political theory. They used the golden signboard of "Marxists" to confuse many people. Aren't there those who have been harmed? They deviated from life and deviated from politics in their creations, and as a result, they failed in their creations one after another. In the past few years, no one who has been influenced by Hu Feng in Tianjin has written any successful works, which thoroughly proves the bankruptcy of Hu Feng's theory.

    Didn't the central and Tianjin municipal Party organizations not criticize and educate them in the past? We know that A Long's "On Tendency," "Poetry and Reality," Lu Dian's "Female Disaster," and Lu Li's poems have all been subjected to kind and fair criticism. But they resisted with fanatical hatred. They fundamentally looked down on all revolutionary writers, and often viciously slandered the leading comrades of the literary and art circles and progressive writers outside the Party. A Long even openly discredited the Party and the government. But for their own people! They are extremely despicable in mutually touting each other. Lu Dian said: "Hu Feng is the contemporary Belinsky, surpassing Lu Xun." Lu Li said: Hu Feng's words are simply "a very serious voice of life to life." And Hu Feng also touted Lu Li as "a rare poet in China," and sealed A Long as "a rare theorist in China." A Long also praised Lu Li as "the heart of a child" in his works, etc. The words are very nauseating. They are such an arrogant, despicable, and filthy small sect.

    With this small sect as the center, they launched a series of organizational activities. As early as 1950, they held many seminars to promote Hu Feng's thought. During the literary and art rectification in 1952, they resisted the rectification and jointly wrote a letter "protesting" the rectification conclusion of Comrade Huang Songling, then Minister of Propaganda of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. When reporting to the Municipal Committee of the Party, Lu Dian also handed the report to A Long for "review" and "revision." Their illegal anti-Party activities became more and more rampant day by day, and have not completely stopped until recently. Moreover, they also wanted to develop the organization and recruited some people from young students, teachers, and cadres to participate in their reactionary organization.

    Currently, according to many exposed materials, we have further seen that this rampant sectarian organization has a close relationship with Hu Feng and is of a counter-revolutionary nature. A Long, Lu Dian, and Lu Li are all Hu Feng's loyal lackeys, and their actions are carried out according to Hu Feng's instructions. A Long's counter-criticism of the "People's Daily" is like this. It was none other than Hu Feng who instructed him how to counterattack the critics, and even found "arguments" for him to help him fight. The secret letters between them are constant. The method is very hidden, and there are many code names and hidden words in the letters. And they often went to Hu Feng's house to report on their work and study the work. A Long and Lu Dian and others not only saw the reactionary document "Report" given by Hu Feng to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China beforehand, but also participated in the writing and discussion of this "Report." Lu Dian also obeyed Hu Feng's order and, at the beginning of this year, cooperated with Hu Feng's attack on the Party and sent a reactionary letter of so-called "appeal" to the responsible comrades of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee. They also set up suspicious formations for Hu Feng and wrote anonymous letters everywhere. When criticizing the film "Wu Xun Zhuan," they also wrote letters in the name of workers to express their opposition. They colluded with each other and tipped each other off. When the "Liberation Army Literature and Art" publishing house was preparing to criticize Lu Ling's "Battle' in the Lowland," the first person to tell Hu Feng about this news was Lu Li. What is even more despicable and reactionary is that they stole many confidential documents of the Party and the state. Lu Dian had shown various Party publications to Hu Feng and A Long.

    Comrades, when I talk about this, I can't restrain my anger. I feel incomparable hatred for these Hu Feng elements. I demand that the Chinese Writers Association resolutely cleanse Hu Feng—the head of this counter-revolutionary clique. Does he deserve the title of "writer" and "engineer of the human soul"? He is the "heart-biting worm" who has drilled into the revolutionary literary and art ranks. He is an evil ghost wearing a painted skin. He is a counter-revolutionary poisonous snake hiding in a "snake pit."

    Comrades! We—the young literary and art workers in Tianjin—have been very insufficiently vigilant against the Hu Feng elements in the past. We used to only feel that they were not good and unwilling to associate with them, but we did not realize their essence. Today, under the education of the Party, we have finally recognized their true counter-revolutionary face. How indignant and painful we feel! Now, the literary and art workers in Tianjin are becoming vigilant, and under the leadership of the Party, they are launching a fierce struggle with the Hu Feng clique. We have enough strength and confidence. Doesn't Hu Feng want to turn Tianjin into a strong "stronghold" of his? That's wishful thinking! Evil conspiracies will never be allowed to succeed. On the contrary, we want to turn Tianjin into a combat outpost against the Hu Feng clique. We must resolutely, decisively, completely, and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng clique's counter-revolutionary activities and its influence in Tianjin. This is the will of the people, and it is also the oath of us—the literary and art workers in Tianjin—before the Party and before the people!

    揭露和谴责胡风反革命集团的罪行
　　——在中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议上的一部分发言
　　叶圣陶的发言
    现在，事情已经很清楚了。胡风的问题还不在他在什么思想上理论上犯了错误，胡风的主要的问题在他一直在进行反党反人民的罪恶活动。
    本月十三日报上披露的胡风给舒芜的那些信，已经够叫人愤怒了。二十四日报上又披露一大批他的信，那些信更叫人愤怒。看了胡风的那些信，我们知道中华人民共和国成立以后，胡风一直在对他的喽罗发号施令。胡风指使他的喽罗混进党里，混进人民团体里，建立据点，探听情况，偷窃文件，收集材料，积蓄力量，积极准备对党和人民政权的疯狂进攻。最近，胡风集团的全面进攻完全失败了，胡风又赶忙布置，叫他的喽罗作假检讨，暂时全线退却，等候时机再来反攻。
    这种两面派的阴谋手段，跟“联共（布）党史”里讲的托洛茨基分子相比，可以说丝毫没有区别。他们的目的也是相同的，都是企图颠覆人民政权，让反革命政权复辟。看最近出版的“文艺报”，从曹禺先生的文章里，知道台湾的广播已经为胡风的“勇敢”的进攻喝采了。这更叫我们认识清楚，胡风反党集团的罪恶活动，跟美蒋特务机关的罪恶活动是完全一致的。
    我们必须把胡风清洗出去。
    我完全同意开除胡风的会籍，撤销胡风的一切职务，并且建议四川省撤销他全国人民代表大会代表的资格。对胡风集团的组织和罪恶活动，还要继续调查，直到水落石出，彻底弄清楚。
  　夏衍的发言
    从我们革命文艺队伍里彻底揭露胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，是我们革命事业的一个伟大的胜利。这等于从我们身上割掉了一个足以致命的毒瘤。
    这个毒瘤长在我们身上已经二十多年了。看了现在已经揭发出来的材料，再回想一下过去，我们真是太麻痹、太缺乏敌情观念了。
    二十多年以来，对于胡风及其一派人的思想言论，我们是不是一点也没有觉察到他们在反对马克思主义、在反对党的文艺方针呢？应该说，早已觉察到、认识到、而且也作了斗争的；对这一派人的行动作风，是不是一点也没有感觉到诡秘、狡诈、不正常呢？应该说，很多人是感觉到、而一直认为难以理解的；对胡风这个人的政治背景，是不是一直没有怀疑过呢？也应该说，早已怀疑过的。在抗日战争前怀疑过，在重庆时期怀疑过，去年他在中国文联主席团和作家协会主席团联席扩大会议上发言之后，更是一直怀疑着的。问题不在于有没有怀疑过，有没有斗争过，而在于我们缺乏足够的政治警惕性，没有彻底弄清楚这一派人的政治本质，所以直到最近为止，我们始终只把他们看作思想上的异己分子，而没有认识他们是巧妙地隐藏在我们队伍里的最阴险的政治上的敌人。
    现在，在党中央的领导和帮助之下，终于把这个反党集团的反革命的本质在广大人民群众前面揭露了。认清楚了这个反动集团的性质，看清楚了这个反动集团对革命事业的危害性，我们就更有勇气和决心来彻底解决这个问题，来把这个反动集团从我们队伍里清除出去了。
    二十多年，我们实在被迷惑、被欺骗得太久了。由于缺乏应有的政治敏感，缺乏对阶级敌人的高度警惕，我们就听任胡风“联络人”、“争取人”、“从事开辟工作”，甚至听任他们在上海利用刘雪苇、彭柏山等担任文教宣传工作的党内干部以及新文艺出版社这样重要的出版机构，来进行反党反人民的罪恶活动，而使我们的革命事业遭受到极大的损失。
    胡风及其反革命集团所以能够长期隐藏在革命阵营里面，进行各种阴谋活动，主要是由于他们有以下几个特点：第一是他们披着马克思主义的外衣，用马克思主义的言辞来反对马克思主义，用拥护共产党的姿态来反对共产党；第二是他们有一整套反党反人民的政治纲领、行动纲领，而进行这种反革命活动的时候又有十分缜密的战略战术部署；第三是他们用极其隐秘的方法，组成了一个组织得很好、又很狡猾的反动集团，而这个集团中还竟有少数党的干部。他们就用这种恶毒的方法来迷惑我们，麻痹我们，一直钻到我们的要害地带，从内部来瓦解我们，破坏我们。毒瘤长在我们身体内部，毒蛇就蟠踞在我们身边。
    在这一次斗争中特别使我们触目惊心的，就是胡风反动集团每一次发动对党和革命文艺事业的进攻，都巧妙地利用了我们思想上、工作中的缺点和错误。他利用了我们在激烈的阶级斗争中的麻痹大意，警惕性不高，对阶级敌人缺乏辨别能力，他利用了我们文艺队伍中的自由主义、个人主义、脱离政治倾向，和某些不团结的情况。阶级敌人一时一刻也没有睡觉，他们处心积虑地在寻找一切可以利用的
  “缺口”，他们在“磨我的剑，窥测方向”。在此，我想起了捷克斯洛伐克伟大战士伏契克的一句话：
  “人们，我爱你们。你们要警惕！”这对我们来说是一个极其深刻的警告。
    胡风及其反动集团的阴谋活动，已经被揭露了，这个反动集团的本来面目，已经大体暴露了，但是在社会主义改造时期，阶级斗争只会更加剧烈，更加尖锐。我们必须从这次斗争中取得足够的经验教训，加强马克思主义的学习，认真执行党的文艺方针，提高警惕，加强团结，改进工作，来保证我们已经取得和将要取得的伟大胜利。
    最后，我完全同意许多同志们的建议，开除胡风的作家协会会籍，撤销他在文艺团体的一切职务，并建议撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。

    胡风及其反党集团在文学上散布资产阶级唯心主义的活动和反党反人民的阴谋，今天在全国人民面前被揭穿，这是全国人民反对资产阶级思想的斗争中又一次很大的胜利。这一斗争的浪潮在政治上思想上再一次清醒了我们的头脑，更加武装了我们的队伍。
    新疆十三个民族的文艺工作者，同全国文艺工作者一道，对胡风及其反党集团进行坚决斗争，这也是我们为党和人民应尽的义务。
    胡风及其反党集团的反动本质说明它不仅是文艺工作者的敌人，同样是我们全国各族人民的共同敌人。当我们听到胡风及其反党集团的反党反人民的阴谋活动时，感到非常愤怒，感到它的阴谋活动在我们进行伟大社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业上是莫大的罪行。
    但是我们知道，中国革命是在中国共产党的领导下在长时期与各种敌人作斗争中得以巩固发展和取得胜利的。全国各族人民得到了解放，我们党的利益和全国各族人民的利益是一致的。因此我们的党是不可战胜的。它领导全国人民能够战胜一切敌人，今天又一次战胜了胡风集团的活动。因为我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，马克思列宁主义指导着我们的一切行动，因此我们的事业是永远胜利的！
    我们各族人民的文艺工作者，在党的领导下，更加团结一致，提高我们的警惕性给那些混入我们队伍里面的各种破坏分子以应得的回击，把它们从我们的队伍里面洗刷出去。
    最后，我代表新疆十三个民族的文艺工作者，建议撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，和在文艺界的一切职务。

    由于五月十三日“人民日报”发表了舒芜揭露胡风的材料，二十四日又发表了一批胡风的密信，胡风及其集团反党、反人民的阴谋罪恶活动，已经充分地揭开来了。这些材料已经足以证明胡风的行为是反革命的行为，他的集团是进行反革命活动的阴谋组织。
    这是一件震动全国的事件。凡是站在人民方面的人，没有一个不愤怒，不痛恨，并且都要毛骨悚然的。二十多年来，我们竟受骗了，我个人也许受骗得还要更多些，特别是在解放以前。胡风混进革命阵营里面来，是在一九三三年左右，那时他参加了“左联”（左翼作家联盟）的活动，我也在上海，但我并没有看出他的虚伪来。后来我离开了上海，于一九三六年夏初回上海工作，现在回想起来，那时胡风显然已经在从事革命文艺内部的分裂活动了。主要的是，当时的上海是在白色恐怖之下，鲁迅先生同群众和地下共产党员的接触是十分困难的，胡风利用了这种困难条件和我们工作上的一些缺点，在鲁迅先生面前进行了挑拨离间活动。他首先是想破坏鲁迅先生和茅盾先生之间的团结与合作，其次是挑拨鲁迅先生和党员作家——如当时在上海的周扬同志和夏衍同志等之间的关系，企图把鲁迅先生从同我们党的亲密关系中拉开，成为他的实现个人野心的资本。当然，胡风的企图没有能够如愿以偿，因为鲁迅先生和我们党之间的巩固关系，是任何反动分子的挑拨离间都破坏不了的；但胡风的恶劣行为也起了一些作用，引起了当时文艺界的一些纠纷，带来了工作上的一些损失，而且使当时在病中的鲁迅先生的心情曾经有一度不愉快。当我到上海时，正是鲁迅先生心情很不愉快的时候，我当时觉得他的不愉快是和革命文艺界内部的一些纠纷有关的。但最使鲁迅先生不快的，是一九三六年六月间，反革命汉奸托派分子写信和寄刊物给鲁迅先生，鲁迅先生当即猛烈地给托派以公开的打击了。可是在这之间，鲁迅先生告诉过我，说革命文艺界中曾经有人因为他没有加入“文艺家协会”（“左联”自动解散后在一九三六年初在上海新成立的进步作家团体），就企图污蔑他是托派，而这是胡风告诉他的。鲁迅先生当时心中不快，显然也和这种事情有关系；但我当时只把这种情况和托派阴谋污辱鲁迅先生的事实向党作了汇报，却没有去追究鲁迅先生所听到的话究竟是怎么一回事，当然更不会怀疑到胡风把这种事情告诉鲁迅先生有什么用意。但今天回想起来，我实在不能不怀疑这种恶毒的谣言究竟从什么地方来的。看现在所揭露出来的胡风的阴谋的伎俩，至少可以断定，胡风是在进行挑拨离间。这种手段既伤害鲁迅先生的心情，同时又显然是政治性的破坏行为。回想起来，我是觉得毛骨悚然的。
    胡风以他曾经和鲁迅先生一度接近为资本。但如大家所已经明白的，他并不是真的尊敬鲁迅先生，更没有为鲁迅先生伟大的、牺牲一切为人民服务的革命精神所感化；他只是企图利用鲁迅先生为他达到个人野心和反人民活动目的的手段，从而侮辱和毁坏鲁迅先生，因为鲁迅先生是人民的光荣。胡风在公开的文章中硬要把鲁迅先生说成为开始就是一个马克思主义者，这决不只是胡风理论上反历史主义的错误，而是有意降低鲁迅先生的伟大，这也是符合胡风反党反人民的意图的。但伟大的鲁迅先生决不是任何卑鄙龌龊的反革命分子所可能玷污和利用的。在当时鲁迅先生没有发觉胡风的卑劣行为，这并不是鲁迅先生的过错，在那时我们大家也都没有警惕。实际上，鲁迅先生在逝世前也是曾经对胡风有过怀疑的，许广平先生后来曾经对别人说过，也对我说过，鲁迅先生曾经以怀疑的态度对她谈到了胡风，说：“真摸不透胡风究竟是怎样一个人。他到这里来，总是说这个不好，那个不好……”说到我个人，据后来许广平先生告诉我，胡风也曾经在鲁迅先生面前诽谤过我；可见胡风不仅要离间鲁迅先生和周扬、夏衍等同志之间的关系，也想离间鲁迅先生和我之间的关系，因为我们这些人都是党员，我们和鲁迅先生的接近，首先是建筑在党和鲁迅先生的关系的基础之上的。
    但我在当时并没有怀疑和警觉，完全被骗了。后来在抗战后期的重庆，以及抗战胜利后在上海，都并没有警觉到他竟是一个戴着假面的反党反人民的阴谋分子。当然，我也一天比一天的感觉到他的狂妄和极端个人主义的种种表现，有时觉得他简直像一个恶霸；同时我也感觉到他的思想感情中有极阴暗的一面，好像革命日益临近全国的胜利对他反而不利似的。但我只以为这是他个人主义思想的表现和没落阶级的意识在他那里的反映罢了，始终认为他在政治上总是跟着我们走的，而错误的思想和意识以及文艺理论上的错误的观点，在政治的前提和同志们的批评之下将会得到改正。但我完全想错了，这说明我的政治警觉性很差，斗争性非常不强，简直是麻痹了；现在完全清楚：胡风坚持他的反马克思主义的文艺理论是以他的反党反人民的政治立场为前提的，他有时流露出来的没落阶级的心理
  （如他后来在“时间开始了”那丑恶的作品中所表现的那样），也和他心中的不可告人的黑暗思想相一致的。在解放以后，由于他的那种坚持错误理论的顽固态度，使我时常联想到他所流露的阴暗心理，有时也就引起了我对他的怀疑，但仍然不曾想到过他会如此恶毒阴险地进行反党反人民的有组织的罪恶活动。这里应该指出，我们的警觉性不高，怎样便利了阶级异己分子的长期埋伏；这是一个应该时刻记住的教训。但当然，这在一方面，也说明了我们始终都是以好意的团结的精神对待胡风的。
    不料他就是人民的敌人！长期以恶毒的手段和阴谋在危害人民、党和党所领导的人民文艺事业的敌人！我们再不能不提高警惕，认识戴着假面的暗藏反革命分子的危害性了，他比公开的敌人要阴险得多。谁曾经想到过二十多年来自称在“党的政治纲领”之下“奋斗”的胡风，竟时刻用了包着侮蔑的“微笑”、“集束手榴弹”、“橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”，在对付我们呢？我们有无数同志曾经在反动派监狱中受过敌人特务的毒打，有无数同志是被杀害了，那时我们是知道敌人是谁的；但胡风及其集团在我们身边谋害我们，在未被揭露之前，我们的确不知道敌人是谁。所谓两面派，就是善于用假的一面掩盖着阴险害人的一面。我们必须从胡风阴谋的揭露中得到认识暗藏反革命分子的经验。
    胡风集团阴谋的揭露，说明了目前阶级斗争的激烈和尖锐。这个集团的反党反人民的活动决不只是反对我们在文艺工作中的一些同志的，也不止是他们在文艺界的所谓宗派活动；这是反革命对于革命的进攻。胡风反革命阴谋活动的揭露，也不能以为胡风的反马克思主义的文艺理论的危害性就减少了；而是相反，恰恰更加证明了他的反动理论的危害性。对于胡风的反动理论以及胡适的反动思想和一切反动思想，必须继续斗争。胡风和他的集团，就是以胡风的披着“马克思主义”外衣而实行反马克思主义的文艺理论为武器的。在人民革命时代，反革命的政治活动必然要披着进步的“理论”外衣，在外衣掩盖之下传播反动思想；同时这种采取两面派的手段，进行反动思想的宣传，并始终坚持反人民立场的分子，必然是要发展到反革命的政治活动的。
    胡风和他的集团已经发展到反革命的政治性的阴谋活动，是完全明白了。
    同志们，我们必须重视胡风和胡风集团的反革命阴谋，必须继续予以彻底的查究，必须完全揭露和肃清这一阴谋活动。我们必须重视这次事件的经验和教训，提高警惕，把暗藏在我们各方面的反革命分子予以肃清，虽然他们是极少数，但危险是极大的！
    今天的会议应该做出决议，首先把胡风从中国作家协会中清洗出去，撤销其一切职务，并建议政府依法处理；同时号召全国作家和文艺工作者更紧密地团结起来，为彻底粉碎这个反革命阴谋组织而奋斗。
　  鲍昌的发言
    我是天津市的一个青年文艺工作者。这几年来，我曾亲眼看到天津文艺界的胡风分子怎样在天津猖獗地进行宗派活动、怎样肆无忌惮地反抗组织、散播反对组织的言论；我看到了天津市党组织怎样在过去向他们进行了批评和教育，而他们怎样狂妄地抗拒了这些批评和教育，我也看到了他们的腐化堕落，把天津市文学艺术界联合会（以下简称“文联”）搞得乌烟瘴气。同志们！我有许多话要说。我要在这个地方提出我的控诉，我控诉胡风反革命集团在天津市的反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动。
    首先我要提到的就是胡风思想在天津市的传播。大家知道，自从一九五○年开始，胡风集团中的一个最重要的骨干分子——阿垅就来到天津了。他在天津文联当了委员。编辑天津文联的机关刊物，他担负的社会职务虽不很多，但却利用了一切机会进行反动的宣传。他所写的“论倾向性”等反动文章都是在天津发表的；他又出版了“诗与现实”、“诗是什么”、“作家底性格和人物的创造”等数十万字的著作；他并且在南开大学讲课，在工人业余艺术学校讲课。他疯狂地进行反马克思主义的宣传。“艺术即政治”“生活内容就是思想内容”这些反动论调都是他在天津的“杰作”。他给我们的工人讲些什么呢？什么“生活就是一条链子，不要考虑去抓哪一环，你随便抓起哪一环，整个链子就抓起来了”；什么“战士打敌人总是找最近的敌人打，写作和这道理一样，写你最接近的生活吧”！“写地主时要用农民的眼光去写，写农民时要用地主的眼光写”；“解放后没有好作品，都是描写技术过程的东西”，等等，就是这样一些反动思想。他给我们的学生们讲些什么呢？“诗是人的主观感情的表现”、“诗就是感觉”等等，就是这些错误的论调。而胡风集团另外一些分子——芦甸、鲁藜等人，也极力鼓吹胡风思想。他们在文联组织创作座谈会，在会上大肆宣扬“到处都是生活”的论调。他们也写诗，在诗里说：“时代的诗人们！请你们来写这样的诗，写我们日常的生活吧：写我们生活的点点滴滴。”他们也强调“主观战斗精神”，根本否认政治理论的作用。他们打着“马克思主义者”的金字招牌，迷惑了不少人。不是有那些受害的人吗？他们在创作上脱离生活，脱离政治，结果在创作上接二连三的失败。几年来，天津市受过胡风影响的人没有写出任何成功的作品来，这就彻底地证明了胡风理论的破产。
    中央和天津市的党组织，在过去不是对他们没有批评和教育的。我们知道，阿垅的“论倾向性”、
  “诗与现实”，芦甸的“女难”，鲁藜的诗，都曾受过善意而公正的批评。但他们却以狂热的仇视进行抗拒。他们根本看不起一切革命作家，经常地对文艺界领导同志和党外进步作家加以恶毒的污蔑。阿垅甚至公然诋毁党和政府。但对他们自己人呢！则是极端卑劣的互相吹捧。芦甸说过：“胡风就是当代的别林斯基，超过鲁迅。”鲁藜说：胡风的话简直就是“一个对人生是非常严肃的生命的声音”。而胡风也把鲁藜捧为“中国少有的诗人”，把阿垅封为“中国少有的理论家”，阿垅也在作品中捧鲁藜为“赤子之心”等等，那些词句是非常肉麻的。他们就是这样一个狂妄的卑鄙龌龊的小宗派。
    以这个小宗派为中心，他们展开了一系列的组织活动。早在一九五○年，他们就开了许多座谈会宣传胡风思想。一九五二年文艺整风时，他们抗拒整风，曾经对当时的中共天津市委员会宣传部长黄松龄同志的整风结论联名写信“抗议”。在给党的市委员会写报告时，芦甸并且把报告交给阿垅来“审查”“修改”。他们这种非法的反党活动日甚一日地猖狂起来，直至最近以前还没有完全终止。而且，他们还要发展组织，在青年学生和教师、干部中，物色了一些人，参加到他们的反动组织中来。
    目前，根据许多被揭发的材料，我们才进一步看到了：这个猖狂的宗派组织原来是和胡风有着密切的联系并且是反革命性质的。阿垅、芦甸、鲁藜都是胡风的忠实走狗，他们的行动都是根据胡风指示来进行的。阿垅对于“人民日报”的反批评就是这样的，不是别人，正是胡风指示他怎样向批评者反攻，甚至替他找来“论据”帮他作战。他们中间的密信是不断的。方式非常隐蔽，信中还有许多代号和隐语。而他们也经常到胡风家里汇报工作，研究工作。阿垅和芦甸等人不仅在事前看到过胡风给中共中央的“报告”那个反动的文件，而且还参与了这个“报告”的写作和讨论。芦甸还奉胡风之命，在今年年初配合胡风向党的进攻，向中央宣传部负责同志提出所谓“申诉”的反动信件。他们也曾替胡风布置疑阵，到处写匿名信。在批判电影“武训传”时，他们还假借工人名义写信表示反对。他们串通一气，通风报信，当“解放军文艺”社准备批判路翎的“洼地上的‘战役’”时，第一个把这消息告诉胡风的就是鲁藜。更为卑鄙反动的是他们盗用了许多党和国家的机密文件。各种党刊，芦甸都曾给胡风、阿垅看过。
    同志们，当我谈到这里时，我抑制不住愤怒了。我对这些胡风分子感到无比的仇恨。我要求中国作家协会把胡风——这个反革命集团的头子，坚决地清洗出去。难道他配得上“作家”“人类灵魂工程师”的称号吗？他是钻到革命文艺队伍中的“咬心虫”，他是披着画皮的恶鬼，他是窝藏在“蛇窟”中的反革命的毒蛇。
    同志们！我们——天津市的青年文艺工作者们，过去对于胡风分子们的警惕性是十分不够的。我们过去只觉得他们是不好的，不愿同他们来往，但没有认识到他们的本质。今天，在党的教导下，我们算是认清他们的反革命真实面目了。我们是感到多末地愤慨和痛恨呵！现在，天津市的文艺工作者正在警惕起来，在党的领导下，正和胡风集团展开了激烈的斗争。我们是有足够的力量和信心的。胡风不是要把天津变成他的一个有力的“据点”吗？那是妄想！罪恶的阴谋永远不能让它得逞。我们倒是要把天津变成一个反对胡风集团的战斗的前哨。我们一定要把胡风集团在天津市的反革命活动和它的影响，坚决地、果断地、全部地、彻底地加以粉碎。这是人民的意志，也是我们——天津市文艺工作者在党的面前，在人民面前的宣誓！
