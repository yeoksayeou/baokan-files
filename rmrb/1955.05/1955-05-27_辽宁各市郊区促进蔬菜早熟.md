Liaoning Cities and Suburbs Promote Early Maturation of Vegetables
    This year, vegetable farmers in the suburbs of various cities in Liaoning Province have implemented advanced methods to promote the early maturation of vegetables, which can make thirteen kinds of vegetables such as cucumbers, potatoes, and cabbages available on the market ten to fifteen days earlier. This year, vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Liaoyang City planted 200 hectares of potatoes, and the seeds have all undergone vernalization treatment, so the potatoes can mature half a month earlier. In the suburbs of Shenyang City, many vegetable production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have made promoting early vegetable maturation a major task. The Lingdong and Ren Qingyu vegetable production cooperatives in Huanggu District have knitted more than 3,000 cold-proof straw hats and more than 6,000 cold-proof mud pots so that cabbages and other vegetables can be planted in the ground earlier. The cabbages planted by the Dongling Vegetable Production Cooperative will mature and be available on the market by mid-June, more than ten days earlier than in the past. Six vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs of Fushun City use oiled paper to cover cucumber and squash seedlings to prevent them from being damaged by frost due to early planting.
    The period during which vegetables can be produced in the open field in Liaoning Province is only about 170 days a year on average. In winter, mainly coarse vegetables are stored to supply the market. The months of April and May every year are the off-season when there is a shortage of vegetables. The implementation of this method this year will greatly improve the shortage of vegetables in the early spring in various cities. (Liu Yi)

　  辽宁各市郊区促进蔬菜早熟
    辽宁省各城市郊区菜农今年推行了促进蔬菜早熟的先进办法，可以使黄瓜、土豆、甘蓝等十三种蔬菜提前十天到十五天供应市场。辽阳市郊区菜农今年种植二百垧土豆，种籽都经过春化处理，这样土豆即可提早半月成熟。沈阳市郊有许多蔬菜生产合作社和互助组，都把促进蔬菜早熟作为一项主要工作。皇姑区陵东和任庆玉两个蔬菜生产合作社，为了使甘蓝等蔬菜能提早定植下地，他们编制了防寒草帽三千多个、防寒泥盆六千多个。东陵蔬菜生产合作社种植的甘蓝，到六月中旬即可成熟上市，比过去提早十多天。抚顺市郊区有六个蔬菜生产合作社，利用油纸扣黄瓜和角瓜秧，使它不至因早种而受冻害。
    辽宁省露地可以生产蔬菜的时期，每年平均只有一百七十天左右，冬季主要贮藏一些粗菜供应市场。每年四五月间都是青黄不接的缺菜季节。今年推行了这个办法，将可大大改善各城市早春缺菜的情况。　　　　　（刘夷）
