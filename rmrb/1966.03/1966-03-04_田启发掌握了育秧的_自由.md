    Editor's note: Tian Qifa's experience in rice seedling cultivation has been promoted in many areas of Hunan. Practice in the areas where it has been promoted proves that his seedling cultivation method is excellent.
    Excellent technical experience comes from excellent thinking. "If we can develop a method to prevent seedling rot, allowing the entire Dongting Lake plain and even the Jiangnan region to plant double-cropping rice, how much grain will the country increase its production by!" By linking the solution of local production problems with the construction of socialism, Tian Qifa established a firm will.
    With the ambition to solve production problems, one must also conduct scientific experiments with revolutionary spirit. Tian Qifa went through countless arduous experiments. In one experiment, he checked the temperature 492 times in eleven days. The "freedom" of early rice seedling cultivation was finally mastered by him.
    "Good seedlings are half the harvest." Cultivating good rice seedlings is an important link in striving for comprehensive rice production increase. With a revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude like Tian Qifa's, who studies for the sake of revolution, one can constantly recognize the mysteries of nature and gain the initiative in transforming nature.
    Farmers in the double-cropping rice areas of southern China are about to busy themselves with sowing early rice. The season for sowing early rice in the south is often accompanied by frequent cold waves, many cloudy and rainy days, and low temperatures. Early rice is most prone to seedling rot when it encounters cold waves. In some places, early rice seedling rot is still a long-standing difficult problem. However, Tian Qifa, a national model of rice production increase, successfully solved this problem several years ago. His experience has been widely promoted in Yiyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, where he is located, in recent years. This year, Hunan Province will promote it on an even larger scale.
    Tian Qifa has been conducting scientific experiments on how to achieve high rice yields since 1952, for over a decade. He has also achieved many successes in other areas, but his early rice seedling cultivation experience is the most outstanding and the most popular.
    The First Discovery
    As early as 1952, Tian Qifa began to pay attention to the problem of early rice seedling rot. However, during the time of mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives, there were few households and not much early rice paddy, and it was easy to manage. The sowing season was also relatively late, and as long as there was careful management, there were not many cases of seedling rot. Tian Qifa only provided general technical guidance. After the communization, the area of double-cropping rice was greatly expanded. The early rice seed of a single production team immediately amounted to several thousand kilograms. With so much seed, it was not easy to control soaking and germination, and it was difficult to manage after sowing in the field. Moreover, in order to achieve high yields of late rice, the work of soaking and germinating early rice seeds was brought forward to a few days before the "Vernal Equinox," so widespread and serious seedling rot occurred everywhere. Because of severe early rice seedling rot, people were afraid to plant double-cropping rice according to potential; even if they planted it, many communes and production teams could not complete the early rice transplanting plan when encountering seedling rot. Some, even after replanting, still delayed the season. At this time, Tian Qifa thought, "If we can develop a method to prevent seedling rot, allowing the entire Dongting Lake plain and even the Jiangnan region to plant double-cropping rice, how much grain will the country increase its production by!" His idea was supported by the commune Party committee and the old farmers in the team. Therefore, starting from the early rice seedling cultivation in 1959, he devoted all his energy to scientific experiments on preventing early rice seedling rot. It was very difficult for an illiterate farmer, relying solely on his original farming experience, to solve such a major new problem as early rice seedling rot. However, Tian Qifa had the ambition to solve the problem of early rice seedling rot in the Dongting Lake area and even the Jiangnan region. With the support and encouragement of Party organizations at all levels, he did not hesitate to put in a lot of labor. When he failed, he was not discouraged, but started again from scratch. That year, he considered the worst conditions everywhere. In addition to selecting good leeward and sunny nursery fields, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and carefully selecting seeds, in order to facilitate the observation of climate changes before and after early rice seedling cultivation and the growth of germinated seeds and seedlings under cloudy, rainy, and low-temperature conditions, he built a small thatched shed next to the nursery field and lived there day and night for more than thirty days.
    After a cold wave, he saw that in some uneven nursery fields, the seedlings in the low-lying areas where there was water rotted away. However, the seedlings inadvertently sown on the field ridges and on soil clumps not submerged in water grew very vigorously. This phenomenon, which he had seen thousands of times, attracted his attention. Regardless of the still cold weather, he rolled up his trouser legs, jumped into the nursery field, carefully pulled out a few seedlings growing on the field ridge, and saw that their roots were numerous and deeply rooted. He also took out some rotten seedlings for comparison and found that the rotten seedlings all had short and small roots, and their stems and leaves were relatively weak. He thought, "If we level the nursery field, and after the germinated seeds are placed in the mud, we let the sun shine on them for a few days, first allowing the germinated seeds to establish their roots firmly, like a person standing steadily, and then releasing water to let them grow leaves, wouldn't the seedlings enhance their ability to resist the cold?" In 1960, he conducted experiments according to this idea, and the seedlings grew very vigorously, not afraid of cloudy, rainy, and low temperatures, and did not wither and die.
    This was the first discovery. Now, one of the points in his seedling cultivation method, "Sun-drying Sprouts to Establish Roots," is developed and improved on the basis of this discovery.
    The Knowledge of Germination
    This only found part of the secret of seedling rot and did not solve the whole problem.
    Once, he found in the nursery field that some places with seedling rot were not really seedling rot, but the seeds simply did not germinate and started to rot. He picked up these rotten seeds and studied them repeatedly. Why did these seeds not germinate during germination? How can we ensure that all seeds germinate?
    He carefully recalled every step from soaking to seedling cultivation, searching for answers.
    Originally, these seeds were treated according to the old method, soaking the seeds in cold water, piling them up in threshing buckets, and letting them naturally generate heat and germinate. Therefore, the seeds placed in the middle of the bucket heated up first and germinated first, while those near the edge of the bucket heated up later and germinated slowly due to the influence of the low temperature outside the bucket. These seeds, which germinated unevenly, became "mute seeds" when sown in the field.
    Now that the reason was found, was there a way to make the temperature of the seeds uniform during germination and germinate all at once? He continued to think hard. Once, he thought, "The middle of the bucket is hot, and the edges are cold, some are fast, and some are slow. If we can make every seed heat up at the same time, wouldn't they all germinate at once?" The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was something to it. He remembered that in the past, some experienced old farmers often poured buckets of hot water on the seeds when sunny days came, so that the sprouts would grow quickly. Now, could we raise the base temperature of the seeds with hot water before germination, or even soak the seeds in hot water, so that every seed would absorb enough heat, and wouldn't they all heat up at the same time once they are germinated?" He thought, "If you scald them with boiling water, I'm afraid they will be ruined." But when he experimented, either the water temperature was too low, and the germination was still uneven, or the water temperature was too high, and the seeds were scalded. What water temperature would be appropriate? Tian Qifa was determined to start experimenting from low temperatures. He first tried using one bucket of boiling water mixed with two buckets of cold water, constantly increasing the proportion of boiling water, and comparing which result was better. Without instruments, he used his hands to test the temperature. After many experiments, he finally mastered the appropriate temperature for germination—using two buckets of boiling water and one bucket of cold water to make warm water (about 65 degrees Celsius), then washing the seeds that had been soaked in cold water for three days and pouring them into the warm water for about an hour, before putting them into the bucket for germination.
    The problem of uniform temperature and even germination was solved, which brought new problems. If the seeds germinate, and there are continuous cloudy days, and they cannot be sown in time, and the sprouts keep growing, what should be done?
    He again found a way to control the growth of germinated seeds by using appropriate temperature and moisture after many experiments. In this way, the sprouts can be spread out in the house for more than ten days, which can stop the growth and prevent death, allowing people to choose the weather and sow them into the mud. This creation completely solved the contradiction between germination and weather, allowing people to be in a more active position.
    Deep Irrigation and Shallow Irrigation
    Tian Qifa's exploration of preventing early rice seedling rot was a journey of ups and downs. When he made some progress on the road to advancement, unexpected difficulties suddenly occurred. In 1960, when the early rice seedlings had emerged and established roots and grown to two or three true leaves, a major cold wave suddenly came. How should the seedlings be cared for at this time? At that time, there were two different opinions: Tian Qifa advocated deep irrigation, with the standard of not submerging the tips of the leaves. His reason was that when the temperature dropped below 10 degrees Celsius, the seedlings had basically stopped growing or were in a "coma" state, and deep irrigation was just like covering them with a "quilt," which could safely survive the cold wave. Another opinion also advocated irrigating to protect the seedlings, but believed that the stomata of the first true leaf should never be submerged. Their reason was that submerging the stomata would "force" the seedlings to die. The two opinions were deadlocked, and each did "experimental fields." As a result, the seedlings that followed Tian Qifa's method did not die, while the seedlings that followed the latter opinion all died. Even so, Tian Qifa was not convinced that his method was absolutely correct. In 1961 and 1962, he conducted continuous experiments again, which proved that this method could allow the seedlings to survive the cold wave. Now, Tian Qifa's method of deep irrigation to "cover" the seedlings has been widely used in the Dongting Lake area, allowing the seedlings to avoid one cold wave after another.
    Making the Seedlings Obey Commands
    Almost every step of Tian Qifa's exploration of early rice seedling cultivation experience was created through such careful observation and repeated experiments. In the process of creating these advanced experiences, he was not satisfied with his existing farming experience of more than 30 years. He asked both old farmers and agricultural scientists for advice, and was interested in new scientific technologies. In recent years, whether he went to meetings in other places or in his daily life, he liked to listen, learn, and experiment with anything that prevented early rice seedling rot. He was always a thoughtful person.
    Tian Qifa's spirit of studying early rice seedling cultivation for the revolution is indeed admirable. In the process of studying early rice seedling cultivation, he often circled around the seeds and seedlings, regardless of sunny or rainy days, day or night. As he himself said, "The seeds are in the bucket, the thoughts are in the bucket, and the person does not leave the side of the bucket; the seeds are in the field, the thoughts are in the field, and the person goes to the edge of the field." When cultivating early rice seedlings last year, from March 20th to 30th, the tense stage of germination and sprout preservation, Tian Qifa hardly left the seeds. He ate, slept, and studied problems by the bucket. According to the records of the agricultural technician stationed in his team, during these eleven days, Tian Qifa checked the temperature 492 times, turned the bucket 26 times, and often stayed up all night.
    It was with this spirit of studying farming techniques for the revolution that Tian Qifa, after five or six years of arduous experiments, finally understood the characteristics of the occurrence and growth of seedling roots. In 1963, the set of experiences he created for cultivating early rice seedlings became more complete. These experiences were further analyzed, studied, enriched, and improved using scientific principles by agricultural technicians in 1964 and 1965, and became more complete, richer, and more reliable.

    田启发掌握了育秧的“自由”
    编者按：田启发的育秧经验已在湖南许多地区推广。推广地区的实践证明，他的育秧办法是过硬的。
    过硬的技术经验，来自过硬的思想。“如果能研究出一套不烂秧的办法，让全洞庭湖滨平原以至江南地区都能种植双季稻，全国要增产多少粮食啊！”把解决当地生产中的问题同建设社会主义联系起来，田启发树立了坚强的意志。
    有了解决生产难题的雄心壮志，还得用革命精神进行科学试验。田启发经历了无数次艰苦的试验。在一次试验中，十一天里，他检查了四百九十二次温度。早稻育秧的“自由”终于被他掌握了。
    “秧好一半谷。”培育好稻秧是争取水稻全面增产的一个重要环节。有了象田启发这样的为革命而钻研的革命精神和科学态度，就能不断识破大自然的奥秘，取得改造自然的主动权。
    我国南方双季稻产区的农民，就要为播种早稻而忙碌了。南方播种早稻的季节，常常是寒潮频来，阴雨天多，气温较低。播种早稻遇上寒潮，最易烂秧。在一些地方，早稻容易烂秧还是个老大难的问题。而全国水稻丰产模范田启发，在几年之前就成功地解决了这个问题。他所在的湖南省益阳专区，近几年已大面积推广了他的经验，今年，湖南省将在更大面积上推广。
    田启发在一九五二年就围绕着水稻如何高产，进行十几年的科学试验。在其他方面，也有许多成就，但是他创造的早稻育秧经验，最突出、最受人们欢迎。
    第一次发现
    早在一九五二年，田启发就开始注意了早稻烂秧的问题。不过，在互助组、农业社的时候，户数少，早稻田不多，种谷少，容易料理，播种季节也比较迟，只要精心管理，烂秧的就不多。田启发也只作技术上的一般指导。公社化以后，大面积扩种了双季稻，一个生产队的早稻种谷，一下就是几千斤。种谷多，浸种催芽不容易掌握，播到田里不好管理；而且，为了使晚稻高产，又把早稻浸种育秧工作提早到“春分”前几天进行，这样，各地就普遍发生了严重烂秧的现象。因为早稻严重烂秧，人们不敢按照可能来种植双季稻；就是种了，遇上烂秧，许多公社生产队也完不成早稻栽插计划，有的虽然补了种，也延误了季节。这时，田启发想：“如果能研究出一套不烂秧的办法，让全洞庭湖滨平原甚至江南地区都能种植双季稻，全国要增产多少粮食啊！”他的想法，得到了公社党委和队里老农的支持。于是，从一九五九年早稻育秧起，他就以全部精力进行早稻不烂秧的科学试验。一个不识字的农民，仅仅凭着自己原有的作田经验，要解决早稻不烂秧这么大的一个新课题，困难是很多的。但是，田启发有一个解决洞庭湖区以至江南地区早稻烂秧问题的雄心壮志，在各级党组织的支持和鼓舞下，他不惜付出了大量的劳动，失败了，不灰心，再从头作起。这年，他处处都从最坏的条件设想，除了选择好背风向阳秧田、施足基肥、精选谷种等以外，为了便于观察早稻育秧前后的气候变化和芽谷、秧苗在阴雨低温条件下的生长情况，他就在秧田边上搭了一个小茅棚，前后三十多天，日夜住在那里。
    一次寒潮过后，他看到一些整得不平的秧田，低处有水的地方，秧苗烂掉了一些，可是，无意播在田埂上和没有水浸的土块上的秧苗，却长得很茁壮。这个平时见到过千百次的现象，这时却引起了他的注意。他不顾当时天气还很寒冷，裤脚一卷，跳下秧田，小心翼翼地拔出几根长在田埂上的秧苗，一看，它的根子多，扎得又深，他又把一些烂了的秧苗取出来对比，发现烂了的秧苗，都是根子又短又小，茎叶都比较瘦弱。他想：“如果把秧田平整好，芽谷下泥后，就放水晒上几个太阳，先让芽谷把根扎稳，象个人一样，站得稳稳当当的，然后再放水叫它长叶，这样，秧苗不就增强了御寒能力了吗？”一九六○年，他按照这个想法进行了试验，秧苗果然长得非常茁壮，不怕阴雨低温，不枯萎死亡了。
    这是第一次的发现。现在，在他的育秧法中有一条“晒芽扎根”，就是在这个发现的基础上发展和健全的。
    催芽的学问
    这只是找到了烂秧的秘密的一部分，还没有解决全部问题。
    一次，他在秧田里发现，有些烂秧的地方，并不是真正烂秧，而是种子根本没有出芽就开始烂了。他把这些烂谷种拿起来反复研究。这些种子为什么在催芽时不出芽？怎样做到使种谷都出芽？
    他从浸种到育秧的每一个环节中仔细追忆，寻找答案。
    原来，这些种谷是按老办法，把冷水浸过的种谷，堆在打禾桶里，让它自然产热、发芽。因此，装在桶中间的种谷就先来热，先出芽，靠近桶边上的，由于受到桶外低温的影响，后来热，出芽慢。这种出芽不齐的种谷，播到田里，有的就成了“哑谷”。
    原因找到了，有没有使种谷催芽时温度均匀、出芽一崭齐的办法呢？他继续苦思苦想。有一次，他想到：“禾桶中间热、边边冷，快的快，慢的慢，如果能让每一粒种谷同时来热，不就可以一齐发芽吗？”他越想越觉得有个道道，记得过去有些有经验的老农催芽时，常常在晴天到来时，给种谷浇上几桶热水，催芽子快长，现在能不能在种谷进行催芽以前，就用热水提高种谷的基温，甚至把种谷浸到热水中，让每一粒谷都吸饱热，一催芽，不就同时来热了吗？”他想：“用开水一烫，恐怕要得。”谁知一试验，不是水温过低，出芽仍是参差不齐，就是水温过高，把种谷烫坏了。水温怎么才合适呢？田启发下决心从低温试起。他先用一桶开水掺两桶凉水试，不断增加开水比重，对比那一种结果好。没有仪器，他就用手来试温。经过许多次试验，终于掌握了催芽的合适温度——用两桶开水一桶凉水，兑成温水（约摄氏六十五度），然后把浸了三天冷水的种谷，洗净后倒入温水中浸上一个钟头左右，就上桶催芽。
    温度均匀，出芽整齐的难题解决了，又带来了新的问题。就是种谷出芽，如果遇上连续阴天，不能及时播种，谷芽一个劲地长下去，怎么办呢？
    他又经过多次试验，找到了利用适当的温度和水分控制芽谷生长的办法。这样就能够让芽谷在屋里摊上十多天，既能停止生长，也不死亡，听凭人们选择天气，播种下泥。这项创造，完全解决了催芽与天气的矛盾。使人居于更主动的地位。
    深灌与浅灌
    田启发探索早稻不烂秧的历程，是起伏曲折的。当他在前进道路上取得一些进展的时候，意想不到的困难突然发生了。一九六○年早稻秧苗扶针扎根长到两三片真叶时，突然来了一次大寒潮。这时秧苗究竟应该怎样护理呢？当时存在两种分歧：田启发主张深灌水，以没尖为标准。他的理由是气温降到摄氏十度以下，秧苗已基本停止生长或处于“休克”状态，深灌水正好是给它盖“被子”，可以安全度过寒潮。另一种意见也主张灌水保苗，但认为千万不能淹没第一片真叶的气孔。他们的理由是淹没了气孔，就会“逼”死秧苗。两种意见，相持不下，各自都做了“试验田”。结果，照着田启发办法做的，秧苗都没有死，照后一种意见做的，秧苗全部死光了。即是如此，田启发也不放心他的做法是绝对正确的。一九六一年、一九六二年，他又连续进行试验，都证明这个办法可以使秧苗度过寒潮。现在，田启发这个深灌水为秧苗“盖被子”的办法，在洞庭湖地区已被普遍施用，使秧苗躲过了一次又一次的寒潮。
    叫秧苗听指挥
    田启发探索早稻育秧经验的每一个步子，差不多都是经过这样细致观察、反复试验，才创造出来的。他在创造这些先进经验的过程中，没有满足自己已有三十多年的作田经验，他既请教老农，也请教农业科学工作者，看到新的科学技术就有兴趣。这些年来，他不论是到外地开会，还是在日常生活中，凡是防止早稻烂秧的事，他都爱听、爱学、爱试验，处处是个有心人。
    田启发为革命而钻研早稻育秧的精神，的确是令人钦佩的。在研究早稻育秧的过程中，他常常不分晴天雨天，不分白昼黑夜，围着种谷秧苗打转。正如他自己所说的：“种谷在桶里，思想在桶里，人不离桶边；种谷到田里，思想到田里，人便去田边。”去年早稻育秧的时候，从三月二十日到三十日这段催芽、保芽的紧张阶段，田启发几乎没有离开过种谷，吃饭、睡觉、研究问题都在桶边。据在他那个队蹲点的农业技术干部的记载，在这十一天中，田启发检查了四百九十二次温度，翻桶二十六次，常常通夜不眠。
    田启发就是以这种为革命而钻研作田技术的精神，经过五六个年头的艰苦试验，终于懂得了秧苗根系发生和生长的特点，一九六三年，他创造的一整套培育早稻秧苗的经验，就更完整了。这些经验，在一九六四年和一九六五年，又经过农业技术人员用科学原理分析研究，并进行充实提高，就更完整、丰富、过硬了。
