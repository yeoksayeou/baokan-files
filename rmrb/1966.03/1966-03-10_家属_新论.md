Title: A New Theory on "Family Members"

    A subordinate position for women in the family probably began after the establishment of patriarchy in society. In class society, this subordinate position of women was strengthened step by step. In feudal society, women were even required to "obey their fathers at home, their husbands after marriage, and their sons after their husbands' death," which shows the extent of this "subordination."

    The reason why women fell into such a position is due to social and class reasons, which gradually separated them from social productive labor, making them "turn around the stove all day, busy with eating, drinking, and dressing morning and night," economically dependent on men.

    The term "family member" arose along with this situation. People usually call women "family members." "Family member" means "belonging" to the "family." Of course, even as a "family member," there are class distinctions: there are family members of the exploiting classes and family members of the working people. Not only that, but there are also differences in eras. In capitalist society, the families of workers are in a position of being oppressed and exploited, just like the workers; in socialist society, they, like their loved ones, have gained political liberation and become masters of the country.

    On the eve of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, reading the reports about the broad masses of Daging workers' families participating in collective productive labor, I naturally thought of the term "family member." Today, although we still use the term "family member" to refer to these women, in reality, they are no longer "family members" in the old sense. Because they have participated in social productive labor, their identity and status have changed, from "family members" of laborers to laborers themselves.

    Participating in social productive labor and shaking off their subordinate position in the family is an important symbol of women's liberation. Engels said in "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State": "The emancipation of women becomes possible only when women are enabled to take part in production on a large, social scale, and when domestic duties require their attention only to a minor extent." This is absolutely true. When women participate in social productive labor, they can achieve economic independence and stand on a truly equal footing with men; they can be tempered in the furnace of collective labor, improve their awareness, and enhance their talents; as Lenin said, they are no longer "captives of household affairs" and have stepped into a vast world. This is only truly possible in socialist society.

    The fact that Daging workers' families have been tempered into revolutionary laborers in collective labor proves that if women want to achieve complete liberation, they must participate in social productive labor, and in the process of participating in social productive labor, they must arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and liberate themselves spiritually. In this way, they can not only shake off their subordinate position in the family, but also fundamentally improve their socialist consciousness and eliminate ideas such as despising labor, relying on their husbands, and narrow self-abasement. These ideas, fundamentally speaking, all have bourgeois attributes. Many Daging workers' families, after studying Chairman Mao's works and being tempered by collective labor, "love labor, think of the collective, and do revolution," establishing a proletarian worldview. This transformation marks their breaking through the shackles of bourgeois ideology and achieving spiritual liberation. It can be said that arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and adhering to the socialist direction are the most important conditions for the complete liberation of women.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Chinese women are a great human resource." Once this great "human resource" is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it can exert a great force capable of moving mountains and overturning seas, and truly play a "half-sky" role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment!

    “家属”新论
    杨浦
    妇女在家庭中处于从属的地位，大概是在社会上实行了父权制以后开始的。到了阶级社会，妇女的这种从属地位，一步一步加强。在封建社会里，竟要妇女
  “在家从父，出嫁从夫，夫死从子”，就可见“从属”到了什么程度。
    妇女所以会陷入这样的地位，是由于社会的原因，由于阶级的原因，使她们逐步脱离了社会的生产劳动，“整天围着锅台转，早晚忙着吃喝穿”，经济上依赖男子。
      “家属”这个用语，也就随着这种情况产生了。人们通常都把妇女称做“家属”。“家属”者，“家”之“属”也。当然，同样是个“家属”，却是有阶级的区别的：有剥削阶级的家属，有劳动人民的家属。不仅如此，还有时代的区别。在资本主义社会里，工人的家属同工人一样处在被压迫被剥削的地位；在社会主义社会里，她们就跟自己的亲人一样，获得了政治上的解放，成了国家的主人。
    “三八”国际劳动妇女节前夕，读了大庆广大职工家属参加集体生产劳动的报道，很自然地就想到了这“家属”二字。今天，我们虽然仍以“家属”二字来称呼这些妇女，但实际上她们已经不再是旧意义上的“家属”了。由于参加了社会生产劳动，她们的身份和地位就发生了变化，从劳动者的“家属”变成了劳动者。
    参加社会生产劳动，摆脱自己在家庭中的从属地位，是妇女解放的一个重要标志。恩格斯在《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》中说过：“妇女的解放，只有在妇女可以大量地、社会规模地参加生产，而家庭工作仅占有她们很少工夫的时候，才有可能。”这话是千真万确的。妇女参加了社会生产劳动，就可以获得经济上的独立，跟男子处于真正平等的地位；就能在集体劳动的熔炉中得到锻炼，提高觉悟，增强才干；就象列宁所说的那样，不再是“家务事的俘虏”，踏进了广阔的天地。这一条，只有在社会主义社会里，才可能真正的做到。
    大庆职工家属在集体劳动中锻炼成为革命化的劳动者的事实证明：妇女要求得彻底的解放，就必须参加社会生产劳动，并在参加社会生产劳动的过程中，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在精神上解放自己。这样，就不仅可以摆脱自己在家庭中的从属地位，而且可以从根本上提高社会主义觉悟，清除轻视劳动、依赖丈夫、狭隘自卑等思想。这些思想，从根本上说，都具有资产阶级的属性。大庆的许多职工家属经过学习毛主席著作，经过集体劳动的锻炼，她们“爱的是劳动，想的是集体，干的是革命”，树立了无产阶级的世界观。这个转变，标志着她们冲破了资产阶级思想的束缚，在精神上得到了解放。可以这样说，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，兴无灭资，坚持社会主义的方向，这是妇女彻底解放的最为重要的条件。
    毛泽东同志说过：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。”这个伟大的“人力资源”，一旦为毛泽东思想所武装，就能够发挥出移山倒海的伟大力量，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，真正起到“半边天”的作用！
