    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 4th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 3rd, once again calling on all democratic forces to rise up and launch large-scale united actions to prevent Nguyen Cao Ky, the U.S. puppet in South Vietnam, from carrying out activities in Japan.
    The appeal stated, "The Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic groups have clearly expressed their intention to protest this visit, which has forced the Sato government to hastily suggest postponing Nguyen Cao Ky's visit here until April."
    The appeal said that Nguyen Cao Ky's visit to Japan was at the direction of the United States to seek support for his puppet regime, thereby legitimizing U.S. aggression and Japan's actions in support of U.S. aggression.
    The appeal pointed out that since the Honolulu Conference, U.S. aggression against Vietnam has gradually escalated, and the U.S. is forcing anti-communist puppets to send more troops. Park Chung-hee has proposed convening an Asian anti-communist conference, and the Sato government has informally decided to participate. It said that inviting Nguyen Cao Ky to visit Japan under these circumstances is "another step in the Sato government's active participation in U.S. aggression."
    The appeal condemned: The Sato government recently emphasized fulfilling the obligations stipulated by the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," attempting to turn Sasebo into a permanent nuclear submarine base, deciding to provide South Vietnam with substantial "economic aid," and intensifying the revival of militarism.
    The appeal said, "Preventing Nguyen Cao Ky from visiting Japan is of great significance for strengthening fighting solidarity with the Vietnamese people." The appeal called on all democratic forces to once again fully exert their strength and successfully prevent Nguyen Cao Ky from visiting Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 2nd: Hori Makoto, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of "Abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and Strive to Realize Various Demands," announced at a press conference on the 2nd that the Central Executive Committee called on the Japanese people to launch a struggle against Nguyen Cao Ky, the U.S. imperialist puppet in South Vietnam, visiting Japan.
    The committee will include opposition to Nguyen Cao Ky's visit to Japan as a slogan for struggle in the national unified action starting on the 20th. He said that the Central Executive Committee is prepared to request the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party-led Japanese opposition to the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines and opposition to the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" to cooperate with it and jointly launch a struggle against Nguyen Cao Ky's visit to Japan.

    日本各界反对美国走狗阮高其访日
    日共谴责佐藤政府积极参与美国侵越战争
    新华社四日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会政治局三日发表呼吁书，再次号召一切民主力量起来展开大规模的统一行动，阻止美国在南越的傀儡——阮高其去日本活动。
    呼吁书说，“共产党、社会党和其他民主团体明确表示要起来抗议这次访问，这迫使佐藤政府急忙建议把阮高其到这里的访问推迟到四月份。”
    呼吁书说，阮高其这次访问日本是根据美国的指示，为他的傀儡政权寻求支持，从而使美国的侵略和日本支持美国的侵略行动合法化。
    呼吁书指出，自从檀香山会议以来，美国对越南的侵略逐步升级，美国正在迫使反共傀儡派遣更多的兵员。朴正熙建议召开亚洲反共会议，佐藤政府已经非正式地决定参加会议。它说，在这种情况下邀请阮高其访问日本是佐藤政府“积极参与美国的侵略的又一步骤”。
    呼吁书谴责：佐藤政府最近强调要履行日美“安全条约”所规定的义务，企图把佐世保变成永久性的核潜艇基地，决定给南越提供大量的“经济援助”和加紧复活军国主义。
    呼吁书说，“阻止阮高其访日对于加强同越南人民的战斗团结具有重大的意义。”呼吁书号召所有民主力量再一次充分发挥出他们的力量，成功地阻止阮高其访问日本。
    新华社二日讯　东京消息：“废除日美安全条约争取实现各种要求”中央执行委员会事务局长堀真琴二日在记者招待会上宣布，中央执行委员会号召日本人民应当展开斗争反对美帝国主义在南越的傀儡——阮高其访问日本。
    这个委员会将于二十日开始的全国统一行动中，把反对阮高其访问日本作为一个斗争口号。他说，中央执行委员会准备要求社会党领导的日本阻止美国核潜艇进驻和反对“日韩条约”全国执行委员会同它合作，共同展开反对阮高其访问日本的斗争。
