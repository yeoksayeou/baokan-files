    The Commune Wants to Build Dazhai Fields (Two Poems)
    Zhang Xiangzhong
    The water conservancy army of the people's commune has arrived, stabbing at random,
    Withered thatch, rampant reeds crushing yellow wormwood.
    This barren land where wind and sand run rampant, oh,
    The tents of wolves and the nests of birds!
    The commune wants to divert river water,
    But the vast wilderness blocks the way.
    The footsteps of the commune members cannot be stopped,
    The water conservancy army has arrived!
    The ground is cleared and the site is leveled without rest,
    Hoes and luggage are carried on one shoulder.
    In the bitter cold of winter, water conservancy is built,
    And the poor and lower-middle peasants fire the first shot!
    The commune members blow the bugle of advance,
    A great fire rolls and burns.
    White clouds are burned red, the night is burned bright,
    Who dares to obstruct us?
    The commune wants to build Dazhai Fields,
    Fiery red slogans float in the sky:
    The rule of heaven must be overthrown,
    Poverty and blankness must be burned away!
    We must follow the Dazhai Road, oh,
    Vowing to change the face of the mountains and rivers,
    Fighting heaven, fighting earth, fighting to the end,
    The wasteland is carved according to the blueprint!

    The ramming chant is cold in the frosty wind,
    Clouds fill the sky, the chants come one after another.
    The ramming worker has a golden voice, oh,
    Calling out chants to make revolution!
    One rammer strikes a pit,
    Five rammers make a plum blossom shape;
    Seven rammers dot golden grains,
    The rhythm of the stone rammer is the clearest!
    Singing lights up thousands of lamps,
    Singing makes carps jump over the sluice gate,
    Building a self-flowing irrigation network,
    Creating a new countryside!
    The rammer flowers are all sunflowers,
    Every flower faces Beijing.
    The rammer song flies to Beijing,
    Singing the strongest voice of the era!
    Loose ones must be pounded tight, soft ones must be pounded hard!
    Sparks flash on the rammer worker's body,
    Iron arms and a steel nature!
    Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death,
    Wholeheartedly for the revolution.
    Whoever wants to dig up the happiness dam,
    Our stone rammer will not agree!

    公社要造大寨田（二首）
    张响钟水利大军开来了乱刺窝，枯茅草，莽莽芦柴压黄蒿。风沙横行的蛮荒地呵，野狼的帐篷鸟的巢！公社要调江河水，茫茫荒原挡住道。社员的脚步挡不住，水利大军开来了！地净场光不歇气，镐锹行李一担挑。数九寒天修水利，贫下中农放头炮！社员吹响进军号，一片大火滚滚烧。白云烧红夜烧亮，谁敢把我们来阻挠？公社要造大寨田，火红的标语空中飘：老天的统治要推翻，一穷二白全烧掉！我们要走大寨路呵，誓叫山水改面貌，斗天斗地斗到底，荒原照着蓝图雕！
    打硪号子霜风冷，漫天云，号子一声赶一声。硪工有副金嗓子呵，叫起号子干革命！一硪砸下一个坑，五硪打成梅花形；七硪点点金谷闪，石硪的节奏最鲜明！唱来电灯千万盏，唱得鲤鱼跳闸门，筑起自流灌溉网，打出一片新农村！硪花都是向阳花，朵朵花儿向北京。硪歌飞到北京去，唱出时代最强音！松的要擂紧，软的要砸硬！硪工身上火星闪，铁的臂膀钢的性！不怕苦来不怕死，一心一意为革命。谁想挖断幸福堤，我们的石硪不答应！
