    Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, New Delhi Dispatch: The Indian Parliament's People's Chamber budget session on the 8th, while debating India's increasingly serious food problem, once again descended into great chaos.

    According to Western news agencies, ruling party Congress Party and opposition party members hurled insults at each other. "The debate grew increasingly intense, the noise grew increasingly severe, to the point that the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament had to rise numerous times to stop the situation, and finally he loudly asked: 'Is the Parliament a fish market?'" It is reported that Indian opposition party members, at the meeting on the 8th, once again raised an impeachment motion against the Congress Party government for its incompetence in handling the food problem. This is the second impeachment motion raised against the Congress Party government in less than a month. At the budget session that opened on February 14th, the opposition party had launched a fierce attack on the Congress Party government's food policies. The report said, "Mrs. Gandhi underwent one of the most severe interrogations in Parliament." Opposition party members questioned the government’s use of troops to suppress anti-hunger demonstrations in Calcutta. Mrs. Gandhi tried her best to defend the government’s suppression actions, but had to admit that India's food problem was "extremely serious."

    According to reports, even more chaotic scenes occurred in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly on the 8th when debating the food issue. Congress Party and opposition party members physically fought each other during the debate, and even the ceremonial staff used by the Speaker to maintain order was broken. Opposition and independent members then collectively walked out of the assembly, declaring a "boycott" of this budget session.

    印度议会为粮食问题吵得不象样子
    甘地夫人受到严厉责问  两派议员互相叫骂
    新华社九日讯  新德里消息：印度议会人民院预算会议八日在辩论印度越来越严重的粮食问题时再次陷入大混乱。
    据西方通讯社报道，执政党国大党和反对党议员互相叫骂。“辩论越来越剧烈，吵嚷越来越严重，以致议会副议长不得不无数次起来制止这种情况，最后他大声问道：‘难道议会是一个鱼市场吗？’”据报道，印度反对党议员在八日的议会上又一次就国大党在处理粮食问题上的无能对政府提出了弹劾案。这是在不到一个月的时间内对国大党政府提出的第二次弹劾案。在二月十四日开幕的预算会议上，反对党就曾经对国大党政府的粮食政策进行了猛烈的攻击。报道说，“甘地夫人在议会上经受了一次最严厉的盘问”。反对党议员纷纷责问政府在加尔各答使用军队镇压反饥饿示威的群众。甘地夫人竭力为政府的镇压行动进行辩护，但不得不承认印度粮食问题“十分严重”。
    据报道，在西孟加拉邦立法议会八日在辩论粮食问题时出现了更加混乱的情况，国大党和反对党议员在辩论中互相撕打起来，连议长用来维持会议秩序的职杖都被打断了。反对党和无党派议员接着全体走出会场，宣布“抵制”这次预算会议。
