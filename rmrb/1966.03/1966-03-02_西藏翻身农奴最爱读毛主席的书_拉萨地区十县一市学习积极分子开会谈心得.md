    According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 1st, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works has greatly developed among the emancipated serfs in Tibet. This was evident at a recent meeting of activists from ten counties and one city in the Lhasa area who are studying Chairman Mao's works.
    More than two hundred Tibetan emancipated serfs and grassroots cadres who have grown up from emancipated serfs participated in the meeting. Many emancipated serfs spoke at the meeting, sharing their experiences in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They said that Tibetan emancipated serfs love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and they draw from Chairman Mao's books the great power that encourages them to carry out revolutionary struggles, continue to seize bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry, and change the poor and backward natural features of the Tibetan plateau.
    Chilai Gongza, Deputy Township Head of Yari Gang Township in Mozhugongka County, said that all eleven agricultural production mutual aid teams in the township have bought Chairman Mao's works, and everyone reads Chairman Mao's books for a while at every meeting and when working together. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which strengthened their confidence in overcoming the difficulty of lacking fertilizer sources. They organized two hundred and thirty-two pack animals to travel over mountains and ridges to transport a large amount of fertilizer from pastoral areas two days away, and also carried out activities of composting and accumulating fertilizer, making preparations for ploughing and production both fast and good.
    Pingcuo Yuji of the Fifth Pastoral Mutual Aid Team in Qiaga Township, Dangxiong County, talked about his experience of drawing strength from Chairman Mao's works and fighting against wind and snow to protect cattle and sheep. Last winter and this spring, there were several heavy snowfalls in the Nam Lake area. The mutual aid team decided to drive one thousand four hundred sheep to Dongga Township, Naqu County, for grazing and to survive the famine. At that time, there were many difficulties. Pingcuo Yuji thought of Chairman Mao's words in "Serve the People" and took the initiative to undertake this arduous task. He put the Tibetan version of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" in his arms and set off with five young people to drive the sheep. Along the way, they crossed snow-capped mountains and snow gullies. With every step forward, the difficulty increased. Some young people wavered in the face of difficulties. But Pingcuo Yuji took the time to read "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" over and over again, and the more he read, the more determined he became. He repeatedly read this article to the other five young people, and the more they listened, the more energetic they became, and finally they drove all the sheep to their destination.
    Many emancipated serfs, herdsmen and grassroots cadres said that Chairman Mao's books are precious books that teach them to strive for emancipation, and a universal key that can open hundreds of locks. Some said: Chairman Mao's books are written specifically for the working people. They are easy to understand as soon as you read them, and they are effective as soon as you use them. The more we read, the more we love to read, and the more we use them, the more we love to use them. Renzeng Zhuoma, the township party branch secretary of Mozhugongka County who was born as a slave, said at the meeting: "I am illiterate, so I ask my son who is studying in elementary school to read to me every night. Many of Chairman Mao's words have touched my heart."

    西藏翻身农奴最爱读毛主席的书
    拉萨地区十县一市学习积极分子开会谈心得
    据新华社拉萨一日电  学习毛主席著作的运动，在西藏的翻身农奴中有了很大开展。这是最近在拉萨举行的拉萨地区十县一市学习毛主席著作积极分子会议上的情况表明的。
    有二百多名藏族翻身农奴和从翻身农奴中成长起来的基层干部参加了这次会议。许多翻身农奴在会上发言，谈了他们活学活用毛主席著作的体会。他们说，毛主席的书藏族翻身农奴最爱读，他们从毛主席的书里汲取着鼓舞他们进行革命斗争、继续夺取农牧业丰收、改变西藏高原穷困落后自然面貌的巨大力量。
    墨竹工卡县亚日岗乡副乡长赤来公扎说，全乡十一个农业生产互助组都买了毛主席著作，每次开会和在一起劳动，大家都要读一会儿毛主席的书。他们反复学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》，增强了战胜缺乏肥源困难的信心，组织了二百三十二头驮畜，翻山越岭到两天路程以外的牧区去运来了大批肥料，并且开展了沤肥、积肥活动，使备耕生产搞得又快又好。
    当雄县恰嘎乡第五牧业互助组的平措玉吉，谈了他从毛主席著作里汲取力量，与风雪搏斗保护住牛羊的经过。去冬今春纳木湖区连降几次大雪，互助组决定把一千四百只羊赶到那曲县东嘎乡去放牧度荒，当时困难很多。平措玉吉想到毛主席《为人民服务》里的话，就主动担起了这个艰巨任务。他怀里揣上藏文版的《毛泽东著作选读》，和五个青年一起赶着羊出发了。一路上，翻了雪山又过雪沟，每前进一步，困难就增加一分。有的青年在困难面前动摇了。而平措玉吉却抽空一遍又一遍地读着《愚公移山》，越读决心越大。他又反复向其他五个青年读这篇文章，大家越听越有劲，终于把全部羊只赶到了目的地。
    许多翻身农牧民和基层干部说，毛主席的书是教他们争取翻身解放的宝书，是一把能开百锁的万能金钥匙。有的说：毛主席的书是专为劳动人民写的，一读就懂，一用就灵，我们越读越爱读，越用越爱用。墨竹工卡县奴隶出身的乡党支部书记仁增卓玛在会上说：“我不识字，就叫在小学读书的儿子每晚读给我听，毛主席的很多话都说到我心上了。”
