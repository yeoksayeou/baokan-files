	The current grain storage team leader of the Yutian Grain Depot, Hu Zemin, when he first arrived at the grain depot, went to clean the bottom of the granary with the old storage team leader, Shi Yunhan, one day. After Xiao Hu swept once, Lao Shi looked at it and said it wasn't good enough, so he swept it again, but it still didn't meet the standards. In the end, Lao Shi taught him hand-in-hand to sweep it a fifth time before he obtained the "certificate of qualification" for sweeping the floor. Afterwards, Xiao Hu asked Lao Shi, "Why be so serious even about sweeping the floor?" Lao Shi said, "You can't be careless or sloppy in anything you do. There are often insect eggs in the dust, invisible to the naked eye. If the bottom of the granary isn't swept clean, the grain will easily become infested with insects."
	Later, when new storage workers came to the depot, Hu Zemin also strictly demanded this of them. The young woman Chen Yanbo swept the bottom of the granary for the first time, and it took her seven sweeps to qualify. Xiao Chen couldn't help but mutter, "Why be so serious about something so unimportant? So picky!" Xiao Hu told her the reasoning that Shi Yunhan had explained, and she then felt that she had received an education in meticulous work style.
	What is being picky? Being picky is excessively finding fault. Is the strict requirement of sweeping the bottom of the granary at the Yutian Grain Depot excessive? No. Sweeping the floor may seem like a small matter, but it's a big deal if it leads to grain infestation. How can such a thing be careless or sloppy? High standards and strict requirements are needed to ensure that work is free of errors and to cultivate a meticulous and serious work style. If this is called being picky, then we need this kind of picky.

### 需要这种“挑剔”

    需要这种“挑剔”
    玉田粮库现在的粮食保管组长胡泽民，刚到粮库的时候，有一天跟老保管组长史云汉去打扫仓底。小胡扫一遍，老史一看不行，再扫一遍，还不合格。最后，还是老史把着手教他扫了第五遍，才取得了扫地“合格证”。事后，小胡问老史：“为啥扫地也这样认真？”老史说：“做啥事，也不能马虎、凑合。尘土里往往有虫卵，肉眼看不见。仓底不扫干净，粮食就容易生虫。”
    以后，库里新来了保管员，胡泽民也这样严格要求他们。女青年陈艳博头一次扫仓底，一连扫了七遍才合格。小陈不禁嘀咕：“啥重要事这样认真？真挑剔！”小胡把史云汉说的道理讲给她听，她才感到是受了一次严细作风的教育。
    什么叫挑剔？挑剔就是过分地找毛病。玉田粮库对于扫仓底这样严格要求，是否过分了呢？不。扫地看来事小，影响到粮食生虫则事大。这样的事情，岂能马虎、凑合？高标准，严要求，才能保证工作不出差错，才能培养出严细认真的作风。如果说这也叫挑剔的话，我们就需要这样的挑剔。
