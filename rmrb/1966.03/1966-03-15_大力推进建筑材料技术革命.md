    Vigorously Promote the Technical Revolution in Building Materials
    Guo Jianyan
    During the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, our country will undertake large-scale capital construction. Building materials are the provisions for capital construction. Before the troops move, provisions go first. Capital construction cannot be separated from building materials. In a country with a population of 650 million, the amount of building materials needed for construction each year is calculated in hundreds of millions of tons, a surprisingly large number. Building materials account for a large proportion of construction costs and transportation volume. The manufacturing and transportation of these materials consume a lot of manpower, financial resources, and materials. The advancement of building materials largely determines whether construction costs can be reduced, whether construction technology and labor productivity can be improved, and whether construction progress can be accelerated. Therefore, developing and using new building materials and carrying out a technical revolution in building materials is, in the final analysis, a major issue related to whether capital construction can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Although the requirements for building materials vary for different construction projects, the most important ones are only two: one is to require light weight, and the other is to require high strength. Because lighter weight can reduce the weight of the entire building, and higher strength can increase the material's ability to bear weight. In this way, the building can be made lighter. It can save materials and manpower, reduce costs, reduce transportation, and speed up construction progress. Many new building materials have emerged under the continuous development of industrial production and scientific and technological levels to meet these requirements.
    The emergence of new building materials often drives the development and revolution of construction technology. Humans initially used natural soil, stone, grass, and wood to build houses, and the technology at that time was very backward. It was not until the invention of cement and reinforced concrete and the use of steel in construction that a fundamental revolution took place in construction technology. Many modern, large-span factories, bridges, and tall buildings could be built. Without the emergence of these new materials with high strength and light weight, the development of construction technology would be unimaginable. If construction technology is backward, the development of the entire production will inevitably be affected.
    In recent decades, new building materials have developed rapidly in the world. Lightweight, high-strength, hollow, large-block wall materials made from industrial waste, low-alloy high-strength steel, building plastics, and various sound insulation, thermal insulation, and decorative materials have emerged and are constantly being improved. At present, in the composition of wall materials in many countries, blocks and large panels account for more than half. In some countries, the output of low-alloy high-strength steel has increased more than tenfold in a few years. Due to the continuous emergence of new materials, many new structural forms have been created. The technology, equipment, and construction machinery for manufacturing various materials have also greatly developed.
    Our country's construction technology has had brilliant achievements in history. As early as before the Qin and Han dynasties, our ancestors used bricks and tiles to build houses, which was very advanced at the time. However, because our country has long suffered from feudal rule and imperialist oppression, productivity has been greatly constrained, and construction technology has been stagnant. Since liberation, we have carried out large-scale capital construction and built many large factories, bridges, and other buildings. The building materials industry has also greatly developed. Research, experimentation, and use of new materials have also made progress. However, compared with the requirements of our country's large-scale economic construction and compared with the world's advanced level, there is still a considerable gap. Because our building materials are relatively backward, the development of construction technology has been affected to a certain extent. This has resulted in relatively large material consumption, high costs, low construction efficiency, and the inability to fundamentally change the backward state of "fat beams, thick pillars, heavy roofs, and deep foundations" in our construction projects.
    The outstanding problem is that wall materials, which account for a large proportion of the weight of the entire building, are relatively backward. At present, more than 90% of the buildings in the country still use solid clay bricks. This kind of brick is not much more advanced than the Qin bricks and Han tiles of ancient China. The blocks are small, heavy, low in strength, and have poor thermal and sound insulation performance. To produce this kind of brick, the country has to dig up two to three thousand acres of farmland every year, occupying hundreds of thousands of laborers, and the labor intensity is high, labor productivity is low, and transportation costs are high. In terms of construction methods, a large amount of manual labor is required, a lot of labor is used, construction speed is slow, and construction costs are relatively high. Our country is undergoing large-scale construction, and the bricks used each year are counted in the tens of billions, which accumulates into a huge waste.
    On the other hand, our country has a lot of industrial waste, such as fly ash from thermal power plants, slag from steel plants, and slag left over from burning raw coal. The country has tens of millions of tons of these every year. These are all good raw materials for manufacturing new building materials, but most of them are discarded now. In order to store and dispose of these waste materials, the state has to build slag yards and dedicated railway lines, spend a lot of investment, occupy a lot of land, and spend a large amount of transportation costs every year. In some places, ash and slag are discharged into rivers, which can also silt up riverbeds, pollute water quality, and affect sanitation. If these industrial wastes are fully utilized to manufacture various new building materials, turning harmful into beneficial, they can replace a large part of clay bricks. According to estimates, every 10 million tons of wall materials made from industrial waste can replace about 4 to 5 billion clay bricks. In this way, the country can lose 6,000 to 7,000 acres of cultivated land less each year; use tens of thousands of fewer laborers; and save tens of millions of yuan in waste disposal costs and transportation costs. After adopting new materials, the structural form can also be improved, which is conducive to improving the level of construction mechanization and assembly.
    Many places are experimenting with comprehensive utilization of industrial waste to manufacture various wall panels and blocks and to mix them into clay brick manufacturing. Some have already started using them and have achieved some initial results. For example, Shanghai has built more than one million square meters of buildings using fly ash concrete blocks, with good results. Construction efficiency has increased by 50%, saving 180,000 yuan in waste disposal costs and 150 acres of farmland less each year. Moreover, the price is already lower than ordinary bricks, passing the economic hurdle. The foam fly ash concrete block successfully trial-produced in Tianjin is light in weight and has good thermal insulation performance. The thickness of the wall can be reduced, and the weight of the wall is three-quarters lighter than a brick wall. The cost of construction is 10% lower on average than a brick wall. It does not cost much to build a factory that produces such new materials, and all capital construction investment can be recovered in a relatively short period of time. This is a great thing that achieves multiple benefits.
    The building steel currently used in our country is also relatively backward, and most of it is carbon steel. This kind of steel has low strength and few varieties, and it consumes a lot of materials when used in construction. Now all countries in the world are vigorously developing low-alloy high-strength steel. Compared with carbon steel, low-alloy high-strength steel can save about 30% in steel consumption, and it is far superior to carbon steel in terms of service life and scope of use, which is of great economic significance. Our country has various rich rare metals, and the technology for producing alloy steel has also been mastered. In the future, we have the conditions to vigorously develop it.
    From the above situation, it is not difficult to see that in order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in capital construction and build our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible, the building materials industry must undergo a technical revolution. We have a superior socialist system, correct construction guidelines, and a certain industrial foundation and abundant resources for developing new materials. It is entirely possible to carry out a revolution in building materials and achieve a thorough turnaround. Therefore, we must vigorously promote the technical revolution in building materials so that our building materials industry, like other departments, can catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in a not-too-long historical period.
    Specific reforms should adopt the approach of walking on two legs. On the one hand, we must actively experiment with, research, and promote the use of new building materials. According to the Party's policy of comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, the development of new building materials should be combined with the comprehensive utilization of industrial waste, and priority should be given to the development of various new materials that utilize industrial waste. The current focus should be on wall and roofing materials and building steel, and building plastics and other materials should also be actively researched and gradually developed. To develop new materials, it is necessary to fully pass the technical and economic hurdles in production and use, and adhere to the principle that everything must be tested. New materials that have been proven to be technically advanced and economically reasonable through practice must be actively supported and vigorously promoted. It is possible that the cost of new materials may be slightly higher in the early stages of development. As long as it is beneficial to the whole, in order to support its development, it is necessary to implement a price subsidy policy for a certain period of time to facilitate promotion and use; industrial waste used to develop new materials should be supplied free of charge, except for a few varieties. In order to promote new materials, it is necessary to strengthen leadership in the future, organize the scientific research, trial production, trial use, and appraisal of new materials, and train technical personnel in this area. All localities should also build a batch of model factories in a planned and step-by-step manner, and select some model projects that adopt new materials to provide typical demonstrations.
    On the other hand, we must vigorously reform the existing brick and tile production. It is impossible for our construction projects to adopt new materials all at once. Bricks and tiles will continue to be an important building material for a long time. However, the current bricks and tiles use a large amount of clay, the production technology is very backward, and the variety is single, which cannot meet the needs of construction. Therefore, it must be gradually improved in the direction of reducing weight, increasing strength, reducing costs, utilizing waste, and increasing varieties, and actively researching and developing high-strength hollow bricks. In order to achieve this direction, it is first necessary to carry out technical transformation of the existing brick and tile factories, such as improving the level of semi-mechanization, mechanization, and labor productivity, reducing the consumption of raw materials and fuel, and increasing the necessary testing and repair equipment, and so on. A brick costs three cents and weighs five pounds, which is often not taken seriously by people. But now the number of bricks produced in the country each year is calculated in the tens of billions, so the quantity is large and the potential is also large. There are more than 1,000 brick and tile enterprises owned by the whole people alone, with 200,000 employees. If labor productivity is doubled, the country can use 100,000 fewer people. If the cost of each brick is reduced by one cent, it will save 100 million yuan when calculated with 10 billion bricks. If the weight of each brick is reduced by one pound, it can save 5 million tons of transportation costs. From the overall point of view, the effect is very large.
    The development of new building materials should proceed from reality, adapt to local conditions, and use local materials. Large cities and industrial areas with industrial waste should actively utilize waste; places without industrial waste should also be simple and crude, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and widely utilize local resources such as sand, stone, bamboo, and wood, and innovate the original materials. For example, some places use crushed stone or pebbles to cast concrete blocks and panels; some use fine sand and lime to develop aerated concrete and sand-lime bricks; some use loess, mountain soil, or shale to make bricks instead of clay to save cultivated land, and so on.
    New building materials must first ensure the use of industrial buildings. Because the number of industrial buildings is large, the effect is significant after use. Civil buildings should learn from the spirit of Daqing's "dry ramming". On the one hand, according to specific conditions, we should actively research and develop various new materials that are inexpensive, suitable, and manufactured using local resources; on the other hand, we should try to adopt traditional folk materials and construction methods and improve them. Now the lives of the broad masses of farmers have generally improved, and rural construction will develop increasingly in the future. How to produce and supply building materials suitable for the needs of more than 500 million farmers in our country will also be put on the agenda.
    The development of new building materials must also implement the principle of local production and nearby use. This is because building materials are materials used in large quantities, and transportation costs account for a large proportion of the cost. Saving transportation costs can greatly reduce costs and facilitate promotion.
    The technical revolution in building materials is a new thing. The development of any new thing will inevitably involve the struggle between new and old ideas. Therefore, in order to realize this revolution, we must first carry out an ideological revolution.
    First of all, we must dare to revolutionize and have the spirit of knowing the difficulties and advancing. The development and use of new building materials are certainly restricted by certain production equipment, construction machinery, scientific and technological conditions, etc., but conversely, the emergence of new materials will inevitably promote the development of production technology and equipment, construction technology and machinery, and building structures, and the progress of science and technology. Things are done by people, and conditions must be created by people. We must oppose both disregard for conditions and the pursuit of newness for the sake of newness, and also oppose one-sided emphasis on objective difficulties, following the old ways, and stagnating. At present, opposing the latter is the main thing.
    Secondly, we must have a holistic view. The development of new materials requires the cooperation and coordination of various departments and obedience to the overall interests. For example, some factories have to spend tens of millions of yuan to dispose of industrial waste, but they are unwilling to spend several million yuan to engage in comprehensive utilization and build new material factories. Comprehensive utilization may increase some trouble from the local perspective of a unit; but from the overall interests of the country, it is greatly beneficial. Therefore, all relevant departments must have a broad understanding and consider the overall situation, resolutely criticize various departmentalism and the erroneous thinking of only seeking their own convenience, and promote the spirit of communist cooperation.
    Third, whether new building materials can be promoted and used, an important link lies in whether the design, construction, and construction departments actively cooperate and actively adopt them. Some construction units are afraid of trouble and are unwilling to change the old operating methods; some design units are afraid of not being safe and afraid of being responsible if something goes wrong. In essence, this is also a question of whether or not to dare to revolutionize. To revolutionize, it is impossible to absolutely avoid taking a bit of risk. Compared with using old materials, using new materials is still a very low-risk thing. Because first, it can be scientifically tested; second, many units have already used it and nothing has happened. As for the price, the state can find ways to keep it no higher than old materials. In the future, it will definitely pass the technical and economic hurdles completely.
    The technical revolution in building materials will gradually lead my country's construction industry to assembly, factoryization, and mechanization. Labor productivity will become higher and higher, construction speed will become faster and faster, project quality will become better and better, and project costs will become lower and lower. Let my country's construction technology shine greatly in the world again.

    大力推进建筑材料技术革命
    郭建言
    我国在第三个五年计划期间将要进行大规模的基本建设。建筑材料是基本建设的粮草。兵马未动，粮草先行，要进行基本建设就离不开建筑材料。在我们这样一个六亿五千万人口的国家，每年建设所需的建筑材料是以亿吨来计算的，数量是大得惊人的。建筑材料在工程建设的成本、运量等方面占着很大的比重，制造和搬运这些材料又需要耗费很多的人力、财力和物力。建筑材料的先进与否，在很大程度上决定着工程造价的能否降低；建筑技术和劳动生产率的能否提高；施工进度的能否加快，等等。因此，发展和使用新型建筑材料，进行建筑材料的技术革命，归根到底是一个关系到基本建设能否实现多快好省的大问题。
    各种建设工程对建筑材料的要求尽管多种多样，但最主要的不外乎两条：一条要求质量轻；一条要求强度高。因为质量轻了，能够减轻整个建筑物的重量；强度高了，又能增加材料本身承担重量的能力。这样，就可以使建筑物更为轻巧。既能节约材料、人力，又能降低成本，减少运输，加快建设进度。许多新型建筑材料就是为了适应这种要求，在工业生产和科学技术水平不断发展的条件下出现的。
    新型建筑材料的出现，往往带动着建筑技术的发展和革命。人类最初用天然的土、石、草、木来盖房子，那时的技术是很落后的。直到发明了水泥和钢筋混凝土，并把钢铁用到建筑上来以后，建筑技术才发生根本性的革命。许多现代化的，大跨度的厂房、桥梁、高楼大厦才有可能盖得起来。如果没有这些强度高、质量轻的新材料出现，建筑技术的发展是很难想象的。建筑技术落后，整个生产的发展也肯定会受到影响。
    近几十年，世界上的新型建筑材料发展很快，利用工业废料制作的轻质、高强、空心、大块的墙体材料，低合金高强度钢材，建筑用塑料和各种隔音、保温、饰面材料等不断出现，并且不断改进。现在，许多国家在墙体材料的构成中，砌块和大板已占一半以上。有些国家低合金高强度钢材的产量，几年内增长了十多倍。由于新材料的不断出现，又产生了很多新的结构形式。各种制造材料的工艺、设备以及施工机械等也有很大的发展。
    我国的建筑技术在历史上曾经有过光辉的成就。远在秦汉以前，我们的祖先就使用砖瓦盖房子，这在当时是很先进的。但是由于我国长期来遭受封建统治和帝国主义的压迫，生产力受到很大束缚，建筑技术一直陷于停滞状态。解放以后，我们进行了大规模的基本建设，盖了很多大型的工厂、桥梁和其他建筑物。建筑材料工业也有很大发展。新材料的研究、试验和使用，也取得了进展。但是，相对于我国大规模经济建设的要求来说，相对于世界先进水平来说，还有相当大的差距。由于我们的建筑材料比较落后，建筑技术的发展在一定程度上也受到影响。因此造成我们一部分建设工程的材料消耗比较大，造价比较高，施工工效比较低，建筑上“肥梁、胖柱、重盖、深基”的落后状态得不到彻底改变。
    突出的问题是：占整个建筑物重量较大部分的墙体材料比较落后。目前，全国百分之九十以上的建筑物还是用的实心粘土砖。这种砖比我国古代的秦砖汉瓦并没有进步多少。块体小、份量重、强度低、隔热隔音的性能较差。生产这种砖，全国每年要挖掉两三万亩田地，占用几十万个劳动力，而且劳动强度大，劳动生产率低，运输费用高。在施工方法上，需要大量手工劳动，劳力用得多，建设速度慢，工程造价也比较高。我国正在进行着大规模的建设，每年使用的砖以百亿块计，积累起来是一个很大的浪费。
    另一方面，我国的工业废料又很多，例如，火电厂的粉煤灰、钢铁厂的矿渣以及燃烧原煤剩下的炉渣，全国每年就有好几千万吨。这些都是制造新型建筑材料的好原料，而现在却大部分弃置不用。为了堆置、处理这些废料，国家要建设堆渣场、铁路专用线，花很多投资，占很多土地，每年还要支出很大一笔运输费用。有些地方，灰渣排入河道，还要淤塞河床、污染水质，影响卫生。如果把这些工业废料充分利用起来，制造各种新型建筑材料，变有害为有利，可以代替很大一部分粘土砖。据估算，每一千万吨工业废料制成的墙体材料，约可抵四、五十亿块粘土砖使用。这样，国家每年就可以少损失六、七千亩耕地；少用几万个劳动力；节省下来的废料处理费用和运输费用也各在几千万元左右。采用新材料以后，还可以改进结构形式，有利于提高施工机械化、装配化的水平。
    综合利用工业废料制造各种墙板、砌块和掺入粘土制砖，不少地方都在进行试验，有的已经开始使用，并初步取得了一些成效。例如，上海利用粉煤灰混凝土砌块，已建成一百多万平米的建筑物，效果很好，施工工效提高百分之五十，每年可节省废料处理费十八万元，少挖农田一百五十亩，并且，价格已低于普通砖，过了经济关。天津试制成功的泡沫粉煤灰混凝土砌块，质量轻，保温性能好，墙的厚度可以减薄，墙体重量比砖墙轻四分之三，工程造价比砖砌墙平均降低百分之十。建设这种生产新材料的工厂，花钱并不多，而且在较短的时间内就可以收回全部基建投资。这是一件一举数得的大好事。
    我国目前所用的建筑钢材，也比较落后，绝大部分都是炭素钢。这种钢强度低、品种少，用在建筑上耗材较多。而现在世界各国都在大力发展低合金高强度钢材。低合金高强度钢和炭素钢相比，在钢材用量上可以节省百分之三十左右，在使用寿命和使用范围上更是炭素钢所望尘莫及，经济意义是很大的。我国有各种丰富的稀有金属，生产合金钢的技术也已掌握，今后完全有条件大力发展。
    从上面的情况不难看出，为了在基本建设上实现多快好省，把我国早日建成一个强大的社会主义国家，建筑材料非进行技术革命不可。我们有优越的社会主义制度，有正确的建设方针，又有一定的工业基础和发展新材料的丰富资源，在建筑材料上进行革命，来个彻底翻身，是完全可能的。因此，我们必须大力推进建筑材料的技术革命，使我们的建筑材料工业和其他部门一样，能够在一个不太长的历史时期内，赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    具体的改革，应该采取两条腿走路的方针。一方面，要积极试验、研究和推广使用新型建筑材料。根据党的综合利用、多种经营的方针，把新型建筑材料的发展和工业废料的综合利用结合起来，优先发展各种利用工业废料的新型材料。当前的重点应该放在墙体、屋面材料和建筑钢材上面，建筑塑料及其他材料也要积极研究，逐步发展。发展新型材料，一定要在生产和使用上全面过好技术关、经济关，坚持一切通过试验的原则。凡是经过实践证明技术上先进、经济上合理的新型材料，一定要积极支持，大力推广。新型材料在发展初期，成本稍高一些是可能的。只要对整体有利，为了扶助其发展，需要在一定时期内实行价格补贴政策，以利于推广使用；用于发展新型材料的工业废料，除个别品种外，应该实行免费供应。为了推广新型材料，今后必须加强领导，组织好新型材料的科研、试制、试用和鉴定工作，培养这方面的技术人才。各地还要有计划、有步骤地建设一批样板厂，并选定一些采用新型材料的样板工程，作好典型示范。
    另一方面，要对现有的砖瓦生产进行大力改革。我们的建设工程不可能一下子都采用新型材料。砖瓦在很长时期内还将是一种重要的建筑材料。但是，现在的砖瓦粘土用量大，生产技术十分落后，品种单一，适应不了建设的需要，因此，必须逐步向减轻重量、提高强度、降低成本、利用废料、增加品种的方向改进，积极研究和发展高强度空心砖。为了实现这个方向，首先要对现有的砖瓦厂进行技术改造，例如，提高半机械化、机械化水平和劳动生产率，降低原料、燃料的消耗，增加必要的化验和机修设备，等等。一块砖三分钱，五斤重，往往不为人们所重视。但是现在全国每年生产的砖是以百亿块来计算的，数量多，潜力也就大。仅全民所有制的砖瓦企业就有一千多个，职工二十万人。如果劳动生产率提高一倍，全国就能少用十万人。每块砖的成本降低一分钱，拿一百亿块计算，就能节省一亿元。每块砖的重量减轻一斤，就能节省五百万吨运量的运输费用。从整体看，效果是很大的。
    发展新型建筑材料要从实际出发，因地制宜，就地取材。有工业废料的大城市和工业区，应该积极利用废料；没有工业废料的地方，也要因陋就简，因地制宜，就地取材，多种多样，广泛地利用砂石、竹、木等地方资源，把原有的材料加以革新。例如，有的地方用碎石或卵石浇筑混凝土块、板；有的利用细砂和石灰发展加气混凝土和灰沙砖；有的利用高原黄土、山土或页岩制砖，以代替粘土，节省耕地，等等。
    新型建筑材料要首先保证工业建筑的使用。因为工业建筑数量大，使用后效果显著。民用建筑应该学习大庆“干打垒”的精神。一面要根据具体条件，积极研究发展价廉、适用和利用当地资源制造的各种新型材料；一面还要尽量采用民间传统的材料和建筑方式，并加以改进提高。现在广大农民的生活普遍提高，农村建设今后会日益发展，如何为我国五亿多农民生产和供应适合他们需要的建筑材料，也将要提到议事日程上来。
    发展新型建筑材料还要贯彻就地生产、就近使用的原则。这是因为建筑材料是大量使用的材料，成本中运输费占很大比重。节省了运费，就能大大降低成本，便于推广。
    建筑材料的技术革命，是一个新的事物，任何一种新事物的发展都必然存在新旧两种思想的斗争，因此，为了实现这个革命，必须先进行思想革命。
    首先，要敢于革命，要有知难而进的精神。新型建筑材料的发展和使用，固然要受一定的生产设备、施工机械、科学技术等条件的制约，但是反转来，新型材料的出现也必然会推进生产技术和设备、施工工艺和机具以及建筑结构等等的发展和科学技术的进步。事在人为，条件要靠人去创造。我们既要反对不顾条件、为新而新，也要反对片面强调客观困难，因循守旧，停滞不前。在目前，反对后者是主要的。
    其次，要有全局观点，发展新型材料需要各部门的协作配合，服从整体利益。例如有的工厂为了处理工业废料要花上千万元，但却不愿意拿出几百万元来搞综合利用，建新型材料工厂。综合利用，从一个单位的局部看，可能增加一些麻烦；但从国家的整体利益看，却大为有利。因此，各个有关部门一定要识大体、顾大局，坚决批判各种本位主义和只图自己方便的错误思想，发扬共产主义的协作精神。
    第三，新型建筑材料能不能得到推广使用，重要的一环在于设计、施工和建设部门是不是大力协同，积极采用。有的施工单位是怕麻烦，不愿意改变老的操作方法；有的设计单位是怕不保险，怕出了事要自己负责。实质上，这也是一个敢不敢革命的问题。要革命，就不可能绝对不冒一点风险。使用新型材料，比较起来还是风险很小的事情。因为第一，可以经过科学试验；第二，许多单位已经用了，并没有发生什么事情。至于价格，国家可以设法使它不高过旧材料。将来，技术上、经济上一定会完全过关的。
    建筑材料的技术革命，将使我国建筑事业逐步走向装配化、工厂化、机械化，劳动生产率愈来愈高，建设速度愈来愈快，工程质量愈来愈好，工程成本愈来愈低。让我国的建筑技术，在世界上重新发出巨大的光辉。
