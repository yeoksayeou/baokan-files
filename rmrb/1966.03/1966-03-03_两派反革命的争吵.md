    The American ruling clique is engaged in a fierce quarrel over the issue of the invasion policy in Vietnam. Military and political leaders, members of Congress, retired politicians, veteran generals, and "authoritative" figures in the press are all involved in this dispute. The American magazine *Newsweek* described it thus: Washington has become "a miserable city with only one topic," and that topic is Vietnam. It is filled with an "atmosphere of anxiety and doubt."

    What are they arguing about? In a word, it's about where the United States should go in Vietnam. Some advocate "offensive" action in South Vietnam, while others advocate "holding on." Some demand that the bombing range of North Vietnam be extended to Haiphong and Hanoi, while others worry that this would risk even greater danger. Some clamor to fight into North Vietnam, even to "bomb all the way to Beijing," while others fear fighting a large-scale ground war in Asia. They argue until their faces are red, quarreling incessantly, but no one can convince anyone else. This quarrel shows every sign of intensifying.

    When a gambler wins at the casino, of course the whole family is delighted; but when he loses more and more, the whole family starts to argue. The big quarrel in Washington is caused by the Johnson administration's repeated disastrous defeats in the war of aggression against Vietnam and the repeated bankruptcies of the "peace talks" fraud.

    It's not the first time that the American ruling clique has engaged in such a fierce quarrel over the policy of foreign aggression. In 1949, the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution declared the complete bankruptcy of the American policy of aggression against China. It was precisely at this time that Washington stirred up a great uproar over the China policy. In 1951, the American aggressors suffered a heavy blow on the Korean battlefield, and the head of the invading army, MacArthur, lost his job. It was precisely at this time that the US Senate conducted a major debate lasting more than seven weeks. Now, a fierce battle of words has broken out within the American ruling clique. Johnson and his government are not only facing fierce attacks from the opposition party, but are also being openly accused by many prominent figures of his own party—the Democratic Party. This unusual phenomenon reflects precisely the serious failure of the US imperialist policy of aggression against Vietnam, and the difficult situation in which it cannot find any way out of its failure.

    The American ruling clique has never been a monolithic entity. Its interior has always been full of heavy contradictions. The United States has two bourgeois political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and each of these parties has many factions. They have always been mutually exclusive and attacked each other. This phenomenon reflects, on the one hand, the conflicting interests between the various American consortia. On the other hand, the American ruling clique uses this mutual quarrel as a smokescreen to fool the people. Lenin said that the American "two bourgeois parties use their sham, empty duels to deceive the people."

    However, no matter how the American ruling clique quarrels with each other, they are completely consistent in safeguarding the fundamental interests of the monopoly capitalist groups, and they are completely consistent in the fundamental policy of enslaving the people at home and carrying out aggression abroad.

    In 1949, when commenting on the great quarrel of the American ruling clique over the China policy, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The two factions of counter-revolutionaries are competing, one saying that our method is the best, and the other saying that our method is the best." "They are trying to persuade their opponents in order to continue their counter-revolutionary methods, which they consider more clever."

    American newspapers call the current divisions within the American ruling clique over the Vietnam issue the "hawk" and "dove" debate. In fact, within the American ruling clique, there is no divergence between "hawks" and "doves" at all, only a divergence between this "hawk" and that "hawk."

    Please see, on the issue of Vietnam, the so-called "hawks" and "doves" quarrel with each other, curse each other, complain about each other, and undermine each other, seemingly irreconcilable. However, as long as people analyze their arguments, they can find that they have no differences on the fundamental issue of aggression against Vietnam. They all do not advocate that the United States abandon its policy of aggression against Vietnam and Asia, they all do not advocate that the US invading troops immediately withdraw from South Vietnam, they all do not recognize that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the sole representative of the South Vietnamese people, and they all do not allow the Vietnamese people to solve their own problems. In a word, their divergence is not whether to invade Vietnam, but what method to use to achieve their aggressive goals.

    While the American propaganda machine is vigorously touting the so-called "hawk" and "dove" debate, the Khrushchev revisionists also echoed, saying that this is a debate between "extreme militarists" and "moderate and realistic" "politicians," and even saying that there has been a "political revolt" in the US Congress. The Khrushchev revisionists say this, of course, not because of political naiveté, but out of political needs. They are trying to convince people that it is only a few American "militarists" who are engaged in aggression in Vietnam, and that the Johnson government is a good guy, but it is under pressure from the "militarists." They are doing everything possible to divide out a "wise faction" from the American ruling clique, and are even praising this "wise faction" to the sky. All this is nothing more than to cover up their reactionary policy of currying favor with US imperialism and colluding with US imperialism.

    The quarrel within the reactionaries is a good thing for the revolutionary people. The great quarrel of the American ruling clique over the policy of aggression against Vietnam can not only make people see the extremely weak and isolated difficult situation of the Johnson government, but also make people see that the aggressive nature of US imperialism will not change. As long as the US imperialist reactionary policy of aggression against Vietnam does not change, no matter which faction of the American ruling clique, and no matter what method is adopted, it will not be possible to find a way out. The so-called "hawks" and "doves" all think that their method is clever. In fact, they are all a bunch of fools, because they all underestimate the power of the people and go against the direction of historical development. The quarrel between them will not have any results. In the final analysis, only the complete victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation will make a clear conclusion for them.

    两派反革命的争吵
    何江
    美国统治集团内部，正在围绕着侵越政策问题，展开一场激烈的争吵。卷入这场争吵的，有军政头目、国会议员、卸任政客、退伍将军和报界“权威”。美国《新闻周刊》描写道：华盛顿已经成了“一个悲惨的只有一个话题的城市”，这个话题就是越南。它充满着“焦虑和疑惑的气氛”。
    他们争吵什么呢？一句话，就是美国在越南何去何从。有人主张在南越“进攻”，有人主张“固守”。有人要求把对越南北方的轰炸范围扩大到海防和河内，有人担心这样会冒更大的风险。有人叫嚣打到越南北方去，甚至“一直炸到北京”，有人害怕在亚洲打一场大规模地面战争。他们争得面红耳赤，吵得不可开交，但是，谁也说服不了谁。这场争吵还大有愈演愈烈之势。
    一个赌徒，当他在赌场得手的时候，合家老小当然皆大欢喜；当他越输越赌，越赌越输的时候，全家就吵开了锅。华盛顿的这场大争吵，是约翰逊政府在越南的侵略战争接连惨败、“和谈”骗局一再破产所造成的。
    美国统治集团内部在对外侵略的政策上进行这样激烈的大争吵，并非破题儿第一遭。一九四九年，中国人民革命的伟大胜利宣告了美国侵略中国政策的彻底破产。正是在这个时候，华盛顿围绕对华政策问题掀起一场轩然大波。一九五一年，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上受到沉重打击，侵略军的头目麦克阿瑟丢了乌纱帽。正是在这个时候，美国参议院进行了一次历时七个多星期的大辩论。现在，美国统治集团内部又展开了一场唇枪舌剑的激烈交锋。约翰逊和他的政府不但面对反对党的猛烈攻击，而且受到他自己的党——民主党不少头面人物的公开指责。这种异乎寻常的现象，正好反映了美帝国主义侵越政策的严重失败，反映了它在失败中找不到任何出路的困难处境。
    美国统治集团从来就不是铁板一块。它的内部从来就充满着重重矛盾。美国有两个资产阶级政党，民主党和共和党，这两个党内又各有许多派系。它们之间从来就是互相倾轧，互相攻击的。这种现象一方面反映了美国各个财团之间的利害矛盾。另一方面，美国统治集团又把这种互相争吵，作为一种愚弄人民的障眼法。列宁说过：美国“两个资产阶级政党利用它们之间的虚张声势的毫无内容的决斗来欺骗人民”。
    但是，美国统治集团内部，不管怎样互相争吵，他们在维护垄断资本集团的根本利益上是完全一致的，在对内奴役人民、对外进行侵略的根本政策上是完全一致的。
    毛泽东同志在一九四九年评论美国统治集团关于对华政策的大争吵时，曾经说过：“两派反革命竞赛，一派说我们的法子最好，另一派说我们的法子最好。”“他们企图借此说服其对手，以便继续他们自认为较为聪明的反革命方法。”
    美国报刊把美国统治集团内部目前在越南问题上的分歧，名之曰“鹰派”和“鸽派”之争。其实，在美国统治集团内部，根本不存在什么
   “鹰”和“鸽”的分歧，有的只是这种“鹰”和那种“鹰”的分歧。
    请看，在越南问题上，所谓“鹰派”和“鸽派”互相争吵，互相恶骂，互相埋怨，互相拆台，似乎是势不两立。然而，只要人们对他们的争论加以分析，就可以发现，他们在侵略越南的根本问题上并没有分歧。他们同样地都不主张美国放弃侵略越南和亚洲的政策，同样地都不主张美国侵略军队立即从南越撤走，同样地都不承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一代表，同样地都不容许越南人民自己解决自己的问题。一句话，他们的分歧，不是要不要侵略越南，而是用什么方法来实现他们的侵略目的。
    当美国的宣传机器大肆渲染所谓“鹰”“鸽”之争的时候，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也附和说，这是“极端军国主义分子”和“温和与现实”的“政治家”之间的争论，甚至说什么美国国会中出现了“政治起义”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者这样说，当然不是由于政治上的幼稚，而是出于政治上的需要。他们竭力要人们相信，在越南搞侵略的，只是美国少数“军国主义分子”，约翰逊政府是好人，它不过受到“军国主义分子”的压力。他们千方百计要从美国统治集团中划分出一个“明智派”，而且把这个“明智派”捧上天。这一切，无非是要替他们讨好美帝国主义、勾结美帝国主义的反动政策打掩护。
    反动派内部的争吵，对于革命人民来说，是一件好事。美国统治集团关于侵越政策的大争吵，既可以使人看清约翰逊政府极其虚弱、孤立的困难处境，又可以使人们看清美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。只要美帝国主义侵略越南的反动政策不变，不管美国统治集团中的哪一派，也不管采用什么办法，都不可能找到出路。所谓“鹰派”和“鸽派”，都自以为自己的办法高明。其实，他们都是一伙蠢人，因为他们都低估了人民的力量，违背了历史发展的方向。他们之间的争吵是不会有结果的。归根到底，只有越南人民抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利来为他们做出明确的结论。
