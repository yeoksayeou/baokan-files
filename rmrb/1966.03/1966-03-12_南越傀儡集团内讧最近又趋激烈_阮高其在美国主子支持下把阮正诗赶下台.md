    According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Saigon on the 11th: The infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique has recently escalated. Saigon puppet leader Nguyen Cao Ky, with the support of his American masters, ousted Nguyen Chanh Thi, his "main rival" and commander of the puppet First Corps, on the 10th.
    According to Western news agencies, at a meeting of the puppet "Armed Forces Council" held on the 10th, Nguyen Cao Ky forcibly ordered Nguyen Chanh Thi to relinquish command of the puppet First Corps and the First Tactical Zone. Western news agencies revealed that the United States supported Nguyen Cao Ky's ouster of Nguyen Chanh Thi because Nguyen Chanh Thi was considered a "most influential" and "troublesome man," "the most likely to lead any new coup." Therefore, after Nguyen Cao Ky ousted Nguyen Chanh Thi, the American authorities immediately "expressed welcome."
    Western news agencies also reported that since Nguyen Cao Ky came to power last June, he has been trying his best to place his cronies and exclude dissidents, which has aroused dissatisfaction among another group of puppet military leaders. At the beginning of this year, the political situation in Saigon was very tense for a time. On January 18, Nguyen Cao Ky himself admitted that a group of puppet generals and officers were "seeking to launch a coup to overthrow him" and took the opportunity to carry out large-scale arrests. Recently, the contradictions between Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Chanh Thi have become increasingly apparent. Nguyen Cao Ky accused Nguyen Chanh Thi of "not obeying Saigon's orders" and took the opportunity to force Nguyen Chanh Thi to step down in order to seize power alone. However, Nguyen Cao Ky is obviously also very worried about his own fate.

    南越傀儡集团内讧最近又趋激烈
    阮高其在美国主子支持下把阮正诗赶下台
    据新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡集团的内讧最近又愈演愈烈，西贡傀儡头目阮高其在美国主子的支持下，十日把他的“最主要的对手”、伪第一军军长阮正诗赶下台。
    据西方通讯社报道，在十日举行的伪“武装部队委员会”会议上，阮高其强令阮正诗交出了伪第一军军长、第一战术区司令的指挥权。据西方通讯社透露，美国支持阮高其把阮正诗赶下台，是因为阮正诗被认为是一个“最有势力的”、“爱闹事的人”，“是最有可能领导任何新的政变的”。因此，在阮高其把阮正诗赶下台后，美国当局立即“对此表示欢迎”。
    据西方通讯社还报道，阮高其从去年六月上台以后，即竭力安插自己的亲信，排除异己，引起了另一批伪军头目的不满。今年年初，西贡的政局一度非常紧张。一月十八日阮高其自己承认，有一批伪军将领和军官“谋求发动政变推翻他”，并且乘机大肆进行逮捕。最近以来，阮高其和阮正诗之间的矛盾越来越表面化，阮高其指责阮正诗“不听从西贡的命令”并乘机逼阮正诗下台，以独揽大权。但是，阮高其显然对自己的命运也非常担心。
