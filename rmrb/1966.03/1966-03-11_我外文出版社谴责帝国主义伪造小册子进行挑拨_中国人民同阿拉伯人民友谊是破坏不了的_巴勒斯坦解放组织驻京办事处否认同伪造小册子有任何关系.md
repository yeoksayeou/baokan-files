    Foreign Languages Press Condemns Imperialism for Forging Pamphlet to Sow Discord
    Friendship Between Chinese and Arab Peoples Cannot Be Destroyed
    Palestine Liberation Organization Beijing Office Denies Any Connection with Forged Pamphlet
    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th. The China Beijing Foreign Languages Press issued a statement on March 10th, sternly condemning imperialism and its lackeys for recently publishing an Arabic pamphlet in the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office and the China Beijing Foreign Languages Press, which has been circulating in some Arab countries. The statement pointed out that their vile purpose is to slander the Palestine Liberation Organization and its Beijing Office, undermine the Palestinian people's liberation struggle, and sow discord between the Chinese people and the Palestinian and Arab peoples. The full text of the statement is as follows:
      Statement by China Beijing Foreign Languages Press
    March 10, 1966
    1. Recently, we discovered that an Arabic pamphlet entitled "The Role Played by the Soviet Union in the Establishment of Israel - A Collection of Historical Materials on Soviet Aid to Israel - Provided by the Palestine Liberation Organization" has been circulating in some Arab countries. The content of this pamphlet consists of statements made by Soviet representatives Gromyko, Malik, etc., at the United Nations between 1947 and 1949 regarding Soviet support for the Anglo-American proposal for the partition of Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel. At the beginning of this pamphlet, there is a preface explaining the reasons for publishing this pamphlet, signed "Palestine Liberation Organization (Beijing)"; then, there is a foreword, signed "Palestine Liberation Organization," without the "(Beijing)" designation. On the inside back cover of this pamphlet, the Chinese title and the publisher "Foreign Languages Press (Beijing)" are printed.
    2. The Soviet Union's position on the Palestine issue is well known, especially to the people of Arab countries. What we want to point out here is that we had absolutely no knowledge of the publication of this pamphlet. The preface and foreword of the pamphlet claim that it was published jointly by the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office and us, which is a complete fabrication. We have never published such a pamphlet, nor has the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office or the Palestine Liberation Organization ever asked us to publish such a pamphlet. This pamphlet is completely forged.
    3. The forgery techniques and skills of this pamphlet are very clumsy. It is enough to cite the following points. For example, the Arabic text of the pamphlet writes "People's Republic of China" as "People's Democratic Republic of China." Also, for example, the Chinese title printed on the inside back cover of the pamphlet writes "Israel" as "Isreal". The printing font of the entire pamphlet is also not the Arabic font that we commonly use.
    4. It is very clear that this pamphlet was published by imperialism and its lackeys in the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office and our press. Their vile purpose is to slander the Palestine Liberation Organization and its Beijing Office, undermine the Palestinian people's liberation struggle, and sow discord between the Chinese people and the Palestinian and Arab peoples. We sternly condemn this shameless act by imperialism and its lackeys. The Chinese government and people have always supported the just struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. The anti-imperialist struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples has also supported the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the just anti-imperialist struggle of the Palestinian and all Arab peoples cannot be destroyed, the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples cannot be destroyed, and the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and its lackeys will never succeed.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th. Rashid Said Jarbu, the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing, recently issued a statement, categorically denying that the organization's Beijing Office has any connection with a forged Arabic pamphlet recently circulating in some Arab countries. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement by the Palestine Liberation Organization Beijing Office
    The representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing recently learned that a book entitled "The Role Played by the Soviet Union in the Establishment of Israel - A Collection of Historical Materials on Soviet Aid to Israel - Provided by the Palestine Liberation Organization" has been published. The preface of the book is signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office, and the cover mentions that it was published by the Beijing Foreign Languages Press.
    The representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing categorically denies that the organization's Beijing Office has any connection with the distribution and publication of this forged book, and declares that the enemies of the people want to damage the good relations between the Palestinian Arab people and the great Chinese people and the Soviet people by distributing and publishing this forged book. The enemy's conspiracy will inevitably be doomed to failure.

    我外文出版社谴责帝国主义伪造小册子进行挑拨
    中国人民同阿拉伯人民友谊是破坏不了的
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻京办事处否认同伪造小册子有任何关系
    新华社十日讯中国北京外文出版社十日发表声明，严厉谴责帝国主义及其走狗最近假冒巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处和中国北京外文出版社的名义，出版一本阿拉伯文小册子，在一些阿拉伯国家流传。声明指出，他们的卑劣目的是想中伤巴勒斯坦解放组织及其驻北京办事处，破坏巴勒斯坦人民的解放斗争，挑拨中国人民同巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的友好关系。声明全文如下：
      中国北京外文
  出版社声明
    一九六六年三月十日
    一、最近，我们发现在一些阿拉伯国家流传一本题为《苏联在伊色列建立时所扮演的角色——苏联援助伊色列史料集——由巴勒斯坦解放组织提供》的阿拉伯文小册子。这本小册子的内容是一九四七至一九四九年期间苏联代表葛罗米柯、马立克等人在联合国发表的关于苏联支持英、美提出的巴勒斯坦分治方案和建立以色列国的一些言论。在这本小册子的头里，有一篇序言，说明出版这本小册子的原由，序言的署名是“巴勒斯坦解放组织（北京）”；接着，又有一篇前言，署名是“巴勒斯坦解放组织”，又无“（北京）”字样。在这本小册子的封底里页，印有中文的书名和出版者“外文出版社（北京）”的字样。
    二、关于苏联在巴勒斯坦问题上的立场，这是众所周知的，特别是阿拉伯各国人民对此十分清楚。在这里，我们要指出的是，我们对这本小册子的出版根本毫无所知。小册子的序言和前言把它说成似乎是由巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处和我们合作出版的，这是彻头彻尾的捏造。我们从来没有出版过这样一本小册子，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处或者巴勒斯坦解放组织也没有要求过我们出版这样一本小册子。这本小册子完全是伪造的。
    三、这本小册子的伪造手法和技巧十分拙劣。只要举出以下几点就够了。例如，该小册子的阿拉伯文本文将“中华人民共和国”写成
  “中华人民民主共和国”。又如，在小册子的封底里页用中文印的书名把“以色列”写成“伊色列”。整个小册子的印刷字体，也不是我们所通用的阿拉伯文字体。
    四、很显然，这本小册子是帝国主义及其走狗假冒了巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处和我们的名义出版的。他们的卑劣目的是想中伤巴勒斯坦解放组织及其驻北京办事处，破坏巴勒斯坦人民的解放斗争，挑拨中国人民同巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的友好关系。我们严厉谴责帝国主义及其走狗的这种无耻行径。中国政府和人民一贯支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争。巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的反帝斗争也支持了中国人民。我们深信，巴勒斯坦和全体阿拉伯人民的反帝正义斗争是破坏不了的，中国人民同阿拉伯人民的战斗友谊是破坏不了的，帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋诡计是决不能得逞的。
    新华社十日讯  巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京代表拉希德·赛义德·加尔布最近发表声明，断然否认这个组织驻北京办事处同最近在一些阿拉伯国家流传的一本伪造的阿拉伯文小册子有任何关系。声明全文如下：
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处声明
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京代表最近获悉，出版了一本名叫《苏联在伊色列建立时所扮演的角色——苏联援助伊色列史料集——由巴勒斯坦解放组织提供》的书。该书序言署名为巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处，并在封面提到它是由北京外文出版社出版的。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京代表断然否认该组织驻北京办事处同发行出版这本伪造的书有任何关系，并且声明，人民的敌人想以发行出版这本伪造书籍，来损害巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民同伟大的中国人民、苏联人民之间的良好关系。敌人的阴谋必将遭到失败的命运。

    这是伪造的《苏联在伊色列建立时所扮演的角色》阿拉伯文小册子封面和封底里页。左一为封面，上面是阿拉伯文书名，下面是阿拉伯文“外文出版社北京”。左二为封底里页，印有中文的书名和出版者“外文出版社出版（北京）”等字样。书名把“以色列”写成“伊色列”，说明这本小册子的伪造技巧十分拙劣。    新华社稿
