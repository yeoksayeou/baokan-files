　　One day, Master Mi gave young worker Du Xijiu the task of making a sampling spoon.

　　Little Du took the drawings and was excited to start marking the lines. He had just taken a step when Master Mi followed him and spoke. He pointed to a pile of scrap material outside the workshop and said, "Use the small pieces!" Little Du thought: Of course, it's just a palm-sized sampling spoon, no need to cut new material. However, when he walked to the scrap pile, spread out the drawings, and looked carefully, he couldn't help but feel anxious. The drawings clearly indicated that thousands of sampling spoons needed eight-centimeter steel plates of the same specifications. Where could he find so many in this scrap pile? Little Du hurried off to find Master Mi.

　　At this moment, Master Wang Yanbing walked towards him. Old Wang said, "Little Du, haven't you started cutting the material yet?" Little Du said with embarrassment, "I need too much material, I'm going to find Master Mi." Old Wang laughed and said, "You're looking for him, who will he look for? Have you forgotten his old temper? Do you think he'll help you get large pieces of material? Hurry up and figure something out from this pile of small pieces."

　　Old Wang's words immediately reminded Little Du. Two years ago, when he first arrived at the second group, he heard about Master Mi's eccentric temper. Other group leaders primarily lead production; secondarily participate in production. Old Mi, however, had an additional task: managing materials and finding materials. When working, Master Mi would either send a section of steel pipe to this person or find a piece of iron sheet for that person. No one could figure out where he got so many suitable old items. On this issue, opinions varied. Some people thought that as a group leader, sending and finding materials was penny-wise and pound-foolish. However, those who knew Old Mi's past understood this old worker's red heart. This small furnace worker, born in the old society, had never touched a complete raw material before liberation. Even when using scrap copper and iron bought from second-hand shops, he had to constantly watch the boss's face, and a slight mistake would result in a beating. After liberation, he adhered to one principle: never use new materials casually, and never waste a bit of new material. He said: "Now, these materials are ours. We are the masters of the house. We must manage the house well."

　　Little Du remembered these things, and his eyes lit up. He plunged into the scrap pile. It's not hard to imagine that finding thousands of materials of the same specifications at once would be very difficult. Normally, Master Mi would have come to help long ago, but today, for some reason, Master Mi was nowhere to be seen. As he picked and picked, Little Du became a little impatient. But when he thought of Master Mi's spirit, he gritted his teeth and continued to search. When Little Du, covered in sweat, finished marking the last sampling spoon and stood up from the scrap pile, he suddenly felt that today he had picked up not only these many materials from this scrap pile, but also a valuable thought, which he did not have in the past. At some point, Master Mi had quietly stood beside him, smiling and patting him on the shoulder, saying: "Young man, you know how to be a master of the house now!"

    拾到宝贵的思想
    赵家騄
    一天，米师傅给青工杜锡久一个制做取样勺的任务。
    小杜领了图纸，兴冲冲地准备去划线。他刚举步，米师傅跟在后面开了腔，他指着工房外一堆下脚料说：“用小料！”小杜心想：这还用说，巴掌大的取样勺，犯得上割新料。可是，待他走到下脚料堆，摊开图纸仔细一瞧，心中不免焦急起来。图纸上明明白白标出，上千件取样勺，需要同一规格的八厘米钢板。这小料堆，哪能找到这么多？小杜拔腿便去找米师傅。
    这时，迎面走来了王延炳师傅，老王说：“小杜，还没下料？”小杜为难地说：“要料太多，我找米师傅去。”老王笑道：“你找他，他找谁？你忘了他的老脾气，他能帮你领大料？还不快从这堆小料里打主意。”
    老王的话，一下提醒了小杜。两年前，当他刚到二组，就听说了米师傅的怪脾气。别的组长第一领导生产；第二参加生产。老米哩，还多出一项任务：管料和找料。干活时，米师傅不是给这个送去一截钢管，就是给那个找出一块铁皮，谁也弄不清他从哪里搞来这么多适用的旧家伙。对这个问题，众说纷纭，有人认为当组长送料找料，是拣芝麻丢西瓜。然而，知道老米过去的人就了解这个老工人的一颗红心。这个出身于旧社会的小炉匠，解放前，从没摸过一块完整的原材料，就连使用那些从旧货店收来的废铜烂铁，也得随时打量老板的脸色，稍有不当，就得挨揍。解放后，他坚持一条原则：决不随便使用新料，更不浪费一点新料。他说：“如今，这些料是咱们的，咱们是当家人，当家要把家管好。”
    小杜想起这些，眼睛一下亮了起来，一头便钻到小料堆里。不难设想，一下要找出上千个同一规格的材料，是很不容易的，平日，米师傅早就来帮忙了，可今天，不知为什么，始终不见米师傅的人影。拣着，拣着，小杜有些不耐烦了。但他一想到米师傅的精神，他便咬着牙关，坚持找下去。当小杜满头大汗，划完最后一个取样勺，从废料堆里站起来时，他忽然感到，今天他从这废料堆里拾到的，不仅是这许多材料，而且拾到了一个宝贵的思想，这正是他过去没有的。不知何时，米师傅已悄悄地站在他的身边，笑迷迷地拍着他的肩膀说：“小伙子，懂得当家啦！”
