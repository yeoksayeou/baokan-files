    "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a Communist Battle Song
    Liu Baiyu

    I. The emergence of "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought on the literary and artistic front. It shows that proletarian revolutionary literature is overcoming everything and advancing sharply. It is a new milestone, marking the entry of our country's socialist literature into a new historical stage.
    When reading this book, one cannot help but be excited. But as I read it page by page, a more powerful ideological force attracted me. This is a solemn and magnificent communist ideal, like a rising sun. Ouyang Hai, this brand-new person, is in this bright red ideal light, full of smiles, full of confidence, and moving forward proudly. Yes, this is an Ouyang Hai, but it is not just one Ouyang Hai, but our entire era, our entire revolution, advancing in a world-shaking heroic posture. That fervent revolutionary enthusiasm, that calm and realistic spirit, that storm-like struggle, that soul-stirring ideological struggle, everything, the voice and appearance of our era, all converge before our eyes at once. Why does "The Song of Ouyang Hai" have such a powerful force? I think the most important thing is that it has created a heroic figure who most profoundly and fully embodies our proletarian revolutionary ideals.
    As the author said:
          "Heroes and heroic behavior are not abstract concepts; they are invariably marked with the distinct imprints of the era and class."
    The distinct imprint on Ouyang Hai is the most essential essence of our era, our class, and our revolution, summarized in one sentence: Ouyang Hai is a person armed with the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.
    When we measure any literary work to see if it has reached the peak of this era, we do not first look at how many bizarre plots or beautiful words it has, but first at whether it has reached the peak of new thought of this era. Our era is the era of proletarian revolution, and our heroes are socialist and communist heroes. The typical significance of the character Ouyang Hai lies in the fact that he is a new person with the most advanced and revolutionary thinking of our era, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and therefore he is the essence of our era, he is our contemporary hero, he is our learning model.
    Today, we are in the era of the final demise of capitalism and imperialism, and the final victory of socialism and communism. Standing at the forefront of this era's torrent, pushing the wheels of history forward on the road to light, will inevitably be the most fearless new people armed with the greatest ideas of this era. Our country's socialist revolution is a great struggle. Due to the deepening of the proletarian revolution, the times have changed, society has changed, and people have also changed. Ouyang Hai, like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, solemnly declares with his unparalleled radiance and powerful power that the communist ideal has been concretely realized in Chinese reality. These are people made of special materials, they are selfless, dedicated to others, unafraid of hardship, unafraid of death, single-minded for the revolution, everything for the revolution, wholeheartedly serving the people, they are broad-minded, fearless, go through fire and water, and are staunch and unyielding. Facing this turbulent and surging great tide of world revolution, what is the decisive force of this era's new birth? The greatest combat effectiveness is courage, fearlessness of death. The most powerful weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it will become a force that destroys the old and rotten, sweeps away all obstacles, and is forever invincible in the world. The heroic image of Ouyang Hai represents precisely this new, advanced, revolutionary force.
    From this point of view, the birth of "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is not accidental, it is first of all a product of the great proletarian revolutionary reality, and also a product of the great proletarian revolutionary spirit. "The Song of Ouyang Hai," with its high ideological and artistic strength, has erected such a heroic image in literary works, radiating the light of communist thought. Therefore, it should be said that "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a breakthrough, a revolution on the literary front. "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is essentially different from previous literary works, it is a book that highlights politics, highlights class struggle, and highlights Mao Zedong Thought. It has broken through the limitations and constraints of bourgeois literature in both ideological content and artistic form, and has made discoveries, inventions, and creations. In summary, "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a brand-new proletarian revolutionary literary work created in accordance with the instructions of Mao Zedong Thought, and only an author armed with Mao Zedong Thought can write relatively perfectly about a hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a very powerful weapon for serving the current revolutionary struggle. Someone, after reading "The Song of Ouyang Hai," made this vow: "A person should live like this, a road should be walked like this." This precisely illustrates the educational effect of "The Song of Ouyang Hai."
   II. Above, I talked about how "The Song of Ouyang Hai" excellently shaped the typical heroic image of the socialist era. Now, let us further examine that the great success of "The Song of Ouyang Hai" lies in the fact that it not only writes about Ouyang Hai becoming a hero, but also writes about how he became a hero. From the whole book, writing about Ouyang Hai's sacrifice only occupies the last few pages, and the author uses the vast majority of the space to write about how Ouyang Hai embarked on the road to becoming a hero, which determines that the work does not pursue the plot and scenes of heroic sacrifice, but focuses on pursuing the great ideological source that can lead to heroic sacrifice. Chairman Mao taught us: politics is the commander, the soul, the lifeline. It is precisely by placing the description of political thought in the main position that "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is not a book that cheaply pursues thrilling plots, but a book that deeply explores the great ideological power of our era. It is for this reason that, from the chapters of the book, one constantly feels the pulse of the class, the pulse of the era, the pulse of the surging of great ideas.
    Ouyang Hai was a good child in his childhood, and also an excellent soldier as a soldier, but measured on the scale of socialism and communism, he still needs to make great progress, and still needs to go through a series of contradictions and struggles. Just think, this child who was raised on bitter water in a poor mountain village covered by wind and snow, suffering from hunger and cold, and called "Crow's Nest" by people, walked barefoot from the sky full of wind and snow, and then, step by step, walked to the peak of communist thought, what a great journey this is! If the first chapter, "In the Wind and Snow," is a preface poem, then the last section, "Red Maples of Hengshan," is a concluding ode. In between, the author correctly and decisively uses the main energy to write about Ouyang Hai's ideological growth in sharp and complex contradictions, developing from an already commendable height to an even higher height.
    The most important point is that the reason why "The Song of Ouyang Hai" writes a hero of the Mao Zedong era is that it truly writes about how Mao Zedong Thought shapes new people, and how the new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought exert such great power.
    In the first half of the book, not only does it write about Ouyang Hai having strong class hatred and tenacious fighting will, but it also boldly reveals Ouyang Hai's shortcomings of being competitive and eager to be a hero, eager to stand out. This provides the conditions for Ouyang Hai to become a truly proletarian hero, both with the conditions to break through and leap forward, and with the limitations that must be broken through and leaped forward. Therefore, in the second half of the book, it further explores that Ouyang Hai can only participate in the social struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and more importantly, launch a struggle in his own mind of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, in order to move towards a higher development path. That is to say, although Ouyang Hai was born into a poor peasant family and was wholeheartedly rushing forward on the revolutionary road, "there are contradictions between the old and new aspects within everything, forming a series of tortuous struggles." ("On Contradiction") The author grasped this internal contradiction, and thus grasped the driving force for Ouyang Hai's development and progress, thereby revealing the spiritual life, inner world, and depths of the soul of the character Ouyang Hai.
      "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is precisely because it shows Ouyang Hai's soul-stirring ideological struggle and self-revolution that it has produced the soul-stirring ideological power of this book. Ouyang Hai's growth and maturity took place after the Military Commission Enlarged Meeting in 1960 made the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army," when the entire army held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighted political work, and advocated the four firsts (human factor first, political work first, ideological work first, living ideas first). How did Ouyang Hai become the hero of our era? To answer this question, we must see how the spark of strong class hatred in Ouyang Hai's heart was ignited into the spark of proletarian consciousness, how it was ignited into the spark of communist thought, so that a person moved from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. In this arduous journey of ideological struggle, the "key to the key" is the Party, is Mao Zedong Thought, which enlightened Ouyang Hai's class consciousness and spirit of self-revolution, and enabled him to overcome the hardships that, frankly speaking, were more serious than any other hardship. He finally achieved victory in this class struggle in his own mind. The high degree of principle that comes with a high degree of consciousness has further cultivated an ordinary but outstanding soldier into a pure and firm socialist and communist fighter, just as Ouyang Hai said before his death: "If it is necessary to sacrifice for the communist ideal, each of us should, and can, do it—without changing our face, without our hearts beating faster."
    The author vividly reflects the changes in people's spirits with a clear and figurative technique, from beginning to end, tightly grasping the red line of ideological struggle and ideological growth, one step tighter than the other, one step stricter than the other, one step higher than the other, constituting the relationship between people in the book, constituting the conflict of plots in the book, constituting the theme of the book, it can be said that each step is deeper than the other, each step is more moving than the other, and every moving place is also the most educational place for the reader.
    If the section where Ouyang Hai struck two hundred and eighty hammer blows in one breath, showing his perseverance and shocking the entire company, has already highlighted such a very lovely soldier in front of the reader like a sculpture, then with a turn of the pen, a new wave unfolded, and higher ideological demands were placed before him.
    At this critical moment, the Party saw his strengths and also saw the shortcomings that are generally not easy to detect. The Party is considering: How can such a good piece of iron be refined into a piece of pure steel?
  Company Instructor and Party Branch Secretary Zeng Wujun is a person cultivated according to Chairman Mao's thought on building the army by highlighting politics. Now, a warm current of class, party, and revolutionary army tradition is pouring from him into Ouyang Hai's heart. It was the Party that cultivated Zeng Wujun in the harsh fighting, and Zeng Wujun is now leading the young Ouyang Hai by the hand, guiding him onto a road that is higher and more advanced than his own.
    "The Song of Ouyang Hai" allows characters to enter fierce and fiery ideological struggles through many trivial daily life matters. Of course, iron ore cannot turn itself into steel, it needs to be burned by fierce fire, it needs to be hammered by iron hammers, melting the iron red-hot, sparks flying, and then it can become pure steel. There are two passages in the book that can be said to be the most precious harvests of this book. One passage is "A Loud Drum Also Needs to Be Struck with a Heavy Hammer." When the company was considering who to send to participate in the militia activist martial arts competition to perform bayonet demonstration, most of the branch committee members advocated that Ouyang Hai should go, because in terms of bayonet skills, he was the best in the entire company. In the end, Zeng Wujun, as the branch secretary, used the one-divides-into-two viewpoint, targeting Ouyang Hai's shortcomings of being competitive and eager to stand out, and believed that "honor is of no benefit to him at present," and decided to send Liu Weicheng instead of Ouyang Hai. Zeng Wujun said: "Ouyang Hai's basic problem of why he is making revolution has been basically solved from his simple class feelings. How to make revolution, how to be a pure person as Chairman Mao taught, this still requires his own efforts and our branch to spend more effort!" Sure enough, a severe test fell on Ouyang Hai's head. When the decision was announced, Ouyang Hai, who was full of a sense of honor, "lowered his head and said nothing." When everyone was helping Liu Weicheng practice bayoneting on the large playground, Ouyang Hai was sitting alone in the room reading a book. Everyone was defeated by Liu Weicheng in the competition, and even Company Commander Guan Yingkui went into battle, only drawing a tie. However, Guan Yingkui saw Liu Weicheng's weaknesses, and in order to better help Liu Weicheng, he went to Ouyang Hai. Ouyang Hai refused to go, so the company commander forcibly dragged him away. Thus, a scene of glittering swords and exciting hearts appeared. Ouyang Hai was holding back a burst of energy, but this soldier who was wholeheartedly striving upward, did he realize how full of personal consciousness these three shots were! He fired three shots in a row, just as a soldier said: "These are the most wonderful, the most wonderful three shots I have ever seen." The result was three to zero. Liu Weicheng stood there all alone, and Ouyang Hai disappeared in a blink of an eye. Subsequently, a fierce ideological struggle led the reader to a higher realm. Zeng Wujun came to Ouyang Hai—this is truly the heavy hammer that strikes the drum!—Ouyang Hai had never seen the instructor so excited, Ouyang Hai had never been criticized so severely. Because Zeng Wujun saw the negative factors in Ouyang Hai's mind, if they were allowed to prevail, they would destroy this soldier, and if they were eliminated, this soldier would leap forward. Zeng Wujun said: "Even if it is honor, Ouyang Hai, we revolutionaries never care about it. We want to compete in loyalty to the Party, in the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people, we never compare ourselves with our comrades in honor." Then, he told the story of how the company commander and another comrade mutually gave up the credit for capturing a heavy machine gun in a past battle. Every sentence and every word of the instructor was like a gun aimed straight at his heart, piercing his sore spot. But when he raised his head, the instructor was gone, and standing in front of him was the clerk. It turned out that the instructor refused to fill in the section of meritorious service and awards in the cadre registration form, and he had already slipped away. Obviously, the one who mutually gave up the credit with the company commander was the instructor himself. This is truly a brilliant description like lightning and thunder! If the above criticism is a heavy hammer, now let us further look at the "loud drum"! Late at night, Ouyang Hai was in pain and could not sleep. He used the light of a flashlight and, with tears of shame in his eyes, wrote a review to the branch on his knees. He understood, he immediately put it into action, here it is written that Ouyang Hai's drum is truly a drum that thunders! In the faint morning light, he took the initiative to find Liu Weicheng on the playground to help him practice bayoneting.
    See, how the author, from a concrete example, suddenly delves into the depths of the character's thoughts, revealing the internal secrets of things, highlighting Mao Zedong Thought's education of people, highlighting people's consciousness.
    Zeng Wujun broke his right arm and was seriously injured in a night of storm at the construction site. He had to leave the company and be sent to the hospital. At this time, his breathing became more and more rapid, but his voice was full of cheerful tones. In this case, he represented the Party branch in admitting Ouyang Hai into the Party. Zeng Wujun left Ouyang Hai with three volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the exhortation to "oppose all kinds of bourgeois ideas, ... first win a victory in your own mind." Yes, it is a fierce battle! Zeng Wujun, who was holding Ouyang Hai's hand forward, left, but from then on Ouyang Hai embarked on a truly "selfless" road of pursuing truth and fiercely fighting to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. With a high degree of class consciousness, he eagerly read Chairman Mao's works, and in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, he practiced concrete things one by one, his steps became steady, he was still so strong, but he seemed even more simple, he embarked on the road of becoming a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from vulgar interests. He could set sail far away.
    If the previous section has already touched the core of Ouyang Hai's thoughts, then the eighth and ninth chapters, "New Test" and "Rushing Up to Meet the Flames," have reached the climax of the book. This is reflected in the way Ouyang Hai handled his relationship with Deputy Instructor Xue Xinwen. This is a sharp struggle between materialism and idealism. Xue Xinwen's heart is good, but he does not investigate and research, and puts the hat of "arrogance and complacency" on Ouyang Hai's head. He subjectively conducts his "help" to Ouyang Hai with misunderstanding of Ouyang Hai and the soldier Liu Yansheng. - This is a complex struggle, in essence, a struggle between two different worldviews, but it involves the struggle between leadership and being led, between principles and lack of principles,... Now, following the ideological struggle clue of revealing the internal contradictions of things, a more complex test than all the previous tests is placed before Ouyang Hai. At this time, Ouyang Hai has become a person who can illuminate his way forward from the perspective of lofty revolutionary ideals. If Ouyang Hai was still in a state of "realm of necessity" in the first half, now he has moved towards the "realm of freedom." He understands that it is not easy to deal with this problem, and what is more, whether this problem is handled well is related to whether the entire company is advancing or retreating, and whether it can better fight for the revolution on the front line. But, it is precisely at this point that the typical of Ouyang Hai, the new generation of communists, reaches the point of perfection. Ouyang Hai eliminated personal selfish thoughts, he insisted on a high degree of principle and also insisted on the spirit of being kind to others, he carried out a serious struggle and also achieved enthusiastic help. On the issue related to Liu Yansheng, he once did not hide his own views and, with a high degree of principle and fearless spirit, faced the deputy instructor and put forward opinions and criticisms. When he himself took the lead in everything, enduring the pain of his burned palms, insisted on heavy labor, and did not leave the "front line" (of course, all of this was obscured by Xue Xinwen's subjectivism and he did not understand it), but instead suffered misunderstandings, and the soldiers in the same squad had different opinions about this. Just think, what a huge wave this is in a person's mind! However, Ouyang Hai patiently pointed out seriously at the squad meeting: a soldier should understand the criticism or praise of superiors from a positive aspect, and he "divides into two" pointed out the positive leading role of the deputy instructor in labor. It is not easy for a person to endure hard work, and it is even more difficult to endure grievances. At this time, Ouyang Hai was not only to maintain the leadership, but to maintain the unity of the entire revolution. He was broad-minded and without resentment, and truly reached the extent of being fearless of thorough materialists. After being shaped by Mao Zedong Thought, Ouyang Hai has become a person with communist style, and is already standing at the forefront of our era. This duel of Party spirit and ideological confrontation has reached the ideological height that became the most brilliant two chapters of the entire book. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only exert great power in storm-like construction site battles, but also exert great power in the turbulent ideological construction.
    The author wrote about Ouyang Hai's ideological struggle, growth, maturity, and role, and has completed the task of shaping a tall communist hero image. It can be imagined that such a person will inevitably rise up without hesitation when encountering the needs of the revolutionary struggle. Naturally, there is no need to describe in detail the plot and scenes of Ouyang Hai's heroic sacrifice, but only use a solemn and revolutionary hymn in the last moment to end the book. As the author said: "In this short period of time, perhaps he said nothing, thought nothing, saw nothing, and heard nothing. But, a belief was driving him: The lives and property of the people must not be lost! The moment to dedicate himself to the communist ideal has arrived! Communist Party members should rush forward!"
    Ouyang Hai walked from Phoenix Village into the army, and he wholeheartedly wanted to be a combat hero like Dong Cunrui. Isn't this an ideal? This is a very good ideal. But when the flames of his class consciousness were ignited, he kept the instructor's exhortations in mind and generated a new belief: If he can abandon all personal selfish thoughts and wholeheartedly work for the Party, for the revolution, and for the people, even if there are no medals on his chest, even if he does not receive a meritorious service report, then he is also a real hero. At this time, he had a truly lofty ideal. Yes, when Ouyang Hai wholeheartedly wanted to be an outstanding hero, he had not yet become a true hero; when he was working steadfastly for the revolution in his ordinary post, he finally became a true hero. Such a hero is not only a person with courageous behavior, but first of all a person with great communist ideological power and spiritual power. This raises the heroic image in our socialist literature to a new height.
    III. The descriptions of character images, real life, and even the progress of history in "The Song of Ouyang Hai" are very realistic, and many chapters have reached the level of vividness and lifelikeness, but this aspect alone cannot explain the artistic characteristics of this book. The problem is that every real detail is unified in a very inspiring, heroic, and ideal light. This constitutes the new artistic style of "The Song of Ouyang Hai," which is full of revolutionary passion, high-pitched tone, and very political and very artistic.
    It dares to let go of writing about the suffering life of the old society. That "Crow's Nest" covered by vast wind and snow, full of famine and death, where poor people were on the verge of extinction, and the last inch of land was taken away, and the poor Fourth Sister starved to death. Can you say that all of this is not miserable? Does it not stir people's hearts? But all of this did not make people overwhelmed by sadness and sorrow. The author wrote about the class hatred and indomitable spirit of Ouyang Hai's family. He wrote about the precious qualities of the poor people.
    It dares to let go of writing about contradictions, writing about contradictions within the people, even contradictions within the army and within the Party, writing about the contradictions of the heroic figures themselves, writing about shortcomings, writing about mistakes, and measuring them on the scale of class struggle. As in the two paragraphs mentioned above, one paragraph writes about the ideological struggle in Ouyang Hai's own mind, and the other writes about an ideological struggle between him and the leader, Deputy Instructor Xue Xinwen. Isn't the contradiction sharp? Yes, it is not only sharp but also arduous. But all of this did not make people feel "exposing the darkness" or "rendering the dark side," but on the contrary, through ideological exchanges, the character's ideological realm and spiritual state became richer and fuller.
    It dares to write about death—Ouyang Hai was rolled into the wheels by a huge train and fell into a pool of blood,... The book not only writes about the heartbreaking shouts of the comrades, but also the canyons echoed with a piece of sorrow, and the flowing water of the Xiangjiang River and the surrounding mountains issued mournful responses. Can you say that such a sacrifice is not painful and tearful? But it does not make people stay in the pain of death and the torture of sorrow. If it makes people cry after reading it, it is definitely not depression, but inspiration. The red maple leaves reflected a piece of bright red on the mountain, the train shook the mountains and earth with a rumbling sound, and on the notebook he left behind was clearly written: "Even if one day I am no longer in this world, I still sincerely believe that the communist ideal will surely triumph, and there will be more and more awakened people fighting for it!" It makes people feel that Ouyang Hai is still alive even in death, like the pine tree that has been symbolically depicted from the first chapter, quietly increasing the rings of its years in the years of suffering. At the end, the author symbolically writes again: "At this time, a ray of sunshine shone on the mountains of Phoenix Village. The straight pine tree stood tall in the sun. The heavy rain had just washed its whole body, and it looked greener and more upright,..." And "under the pine tree, countless pine cones have broken ground and sprouted, and rows of sturdy small pine seedlings are growing in the sun." The author leads people from Ouyang Hai's sacrifice to a higher and farther direction.
      "The Song of Ouyang Hai" does not avoid contradictions, does not avoid hardships, and does not avoid death, but transforms all of this into powerful ideological power and powerful artistic power. It infects people and improves people. I think the main point is that the author writes with deep proletarian feelings. Only by standing at the height of the proletarian position, standing at the height of Mao Zedong Thought, that is, "observing life and describing life from the peak of the highest ideal of the communist era" (Zhou Yang: "The Road of Socialist Literature and Art in Our Country"), is the root cause of the huge artistic appeal of this book. And only from this starting point can an author move towards the road of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in creation.
    Isn't the "Foolish Old Man Removing the Mountain" spirit of our socialist era full of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism? Isn't the spirit of the People's Liberation Army, the spirit of Daqing, and the spirit of Dazhai full of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism? Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. The reason why it is vigorous and not corrupt is because our philosophy is the philosophy of struggle, the philosophy that guarantees our continuous progress, and the philosophy that guarantees our vitality." This revolutionary philosophy combines calm scientific analysis with fervent revolutionary spirit, so proletarian revolutionaries see light in difficulty and see victory in sacrifice. A revolutionary is inspired by a lofty ideal and a lofty aspiration at any time and under any circumstances.
    Revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in art come from revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in real life. An author can only use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, have a true proletarian stand, thought, and feelings—have a philosophy of struggle, have a spirit of seeking truth, observe life carefully and deeply, and yet be far-sighted and full of ideals, so that he can weave revolutionary passion and realistic description together. The method of creation is by no means just writing skills, it contains the newest and most ideal form from observing life to creating and expressing this life content. A writer of a proletarian revolutionary era can only truly and deeply understand his era, the people of his era, and have the most advanced and revolutionary ideas, so that he can create boldly, innovate, create a new style of writing of our generation, and create a unique artistic form that expresses the spiritual outlook of the proletarian revolutionary era. Only with a true proletarian worldview and artistic view can he master the true proletarian artistic method. If you only interpret the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism from the history of bourgeois literature according to abstract definitions, that is empty talk, and you will not be able to master this revolutionary method of creation even if you talk about it for a hundred years. If you do not allow yourself to be manipulated by the bourgeois set, if you dare to break through their framework, have a proletarian stand, and have Mao Zedong Thought, you can keenly delve into the essence of the real life of the revolutionary people, the essence of spiritual life, and you can use the best creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and you can express our era's demeanor and revolutionary outlook both realistically and accurately, and vigorously. Only when the author is the most sober revolutionary realist and the most idealistic revolutionary idealist can he observe life and reflect life with calm analysis and revolutionary pride.
    The artistic characteristic of "The Song of Ouyang Hai" lies in closely combining the proletarian philosophy of struggle with revolutionary poetry. Therefore, I say that this book is a rare book with the traditional style of "The Internationale," it shines with the flashes of revolutionary thought and also shines with the flashes of revolutionary art. The reason why it has such artistic appeal, as I said earlier, is inseparable from the fact that the author has deep class feelings. The facts show that only by solving this fundamental class stand problem can your thoughts and feelings be freely expressed, and your imagination can be freely galloped. It is precisely the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism that makes "The Song of Ouyang Hai" a book with splendid artistic colors, fresh and bright. Some chapters are beautiful lyric poems, some chapters are oil paintings with bright colors, some chapters are majestic odes, and more importantly, throughout the whole book, it is full of heroic language, bright colors, majestic style, and is a very revolutionary and combative book. Therefore, no matter how it changes, even in a detail, the author's pen often implicitly contains very touching deep class feelings and lofty revolutionary ideals. I would like to give an example to illustrate: Near the end of the book, Company Commander Guan Yingkui told Ouyang Hai the news that he would be transferred to work in a national defense factory, and the company commander was about to pick up new recruits, and the two of them were about to part ways. At this time, Guan Yingkui took off the pen on his chest and gave it to Ouyang Hai, here is a description:
    "'I'm not just giving you a pen!' Guan Yingkui pointed to the scar on the back of his head and said, 'In 1948, after completing the blocking task in Heishan, I was injured, and the regimental political commissar—that is, our old political commissar today—awarded me this pen and told me to study hard. At that time, I didn't even know that a carrying pole falling on the ground was the letter "one," and I relied on this pen to learn to write "Long Live the Communist Party" and wrote the application to join the Party. But my brain was shaken, and my progress was not great... You are about to move to a new position, take this pen with you.'... Guan Yingkui picked up his luggage and walked towards the regimental headquarters. Ouyang Hai stroked the old-fashioned black pen in his hand, and there were several grooves on the penholder, which were pinched out by Guan Yingkui's big hands. It vividly recorded the company commander's tenacity in learning. At this time, he seemed to understand the company commander's intentions more deeply."
    This is a detail, but after the author's few strokes, a stream of proletarian class feelings and lofty ideals immediately rushed into your heart. Immediately afterwards, during a period of camping life, Ouyang Hai heroically dedicated his life. Many reviews highly praised the description of the short moment of the final sacrifice, but this is not isolated. Only because the entire creative method is the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism can the highest revolutionary passion erupt in the end, and only then can the reader leave behind infinite longing. Ouyang Hai's life ended, "The Song of Ouyang Hai" ended, but a song of communism is forever magnificent, swirling and agitating in your heart.
                                  IV
    In addition to evaluating "The Song of Ouyang Hai" from the aspects of ideology and artistry, we say that "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is a brand-new book, a book of truly proletarian revolutionary literature, and it is necessary to fully estimate that it is a very eloquent and powerful criticism of domestic bourgeois literary and artistic thought and foreign modern revisionist literary and artistic thought on the literary front.
    The class struggle in the ideological field is sharp. Is it to shape the glorious heroic images of the proletarian and socialist era, or to fill socialist literary works with various outdated and bourgeois gray little people? This is the fundamental question of transforming the world with the proletarian worldview or the bourgeois worldview, the fundamental question of serving the proletariat or serving the bourgeoisie.
    Soviet modern revisionist literature has degenerated into a literature that betrays the proletarian revolution. They advocate "de-heroization" and "small truth," especially in works describing war, using "the truth of the trenches" as an excuse to openly promote the despicable and shameless psychology of traitors. They betray and slander those heroes who shed blood and sacrificed in the October Revolution and the anti-fascist war, and write about war and sacrifice as a piece of darkness and desolation. They pick up the leftovers of Western bourgeois reactionary decadent literature to pollute and corrode the hearts of the people in socialist countries. Revisionist literature serves revisionist politics. Their political purpose is to stifle the revolutionary spirit of the people and disintegrate the people's will to fight.
    In the process of socialist revolution in our country, class struggle still exists. This class struggle is bound to be reflected in a very complex and sharp way in literature. For more than ten years, some people have advocated writing about the "spiritual slavery wounds" of the working people, some people have advocated making the "large number of existing" "mediocre people" the "important protagonists" of literary works, some people have advocated "writing about middle characters," writing about "not good or bad, neither good nor bad, mediocre masses," writing about the "spiritual burden of individual farmers for thousands of years," writing about the "difficult process" of people's ideological transformation. These are nothing more than another way of saying "de-heroization," pushing "middle characters"—that is, bourgeois petty people—to the main position of literary creation, in order to negate the new heroic images of socialism and communism. This is a manifestation of a trend against socialism in literature. There is no doubt that this proposition serves bourgeois politics. According to their propositions, the characters written can only lead the people away from the socialist road and towards the capitalist road.
    What we should pay attention to is that whether it is domestic bourgeois literary and artistic thought or foreign modern revisionist literary and artistic thought, their common guiding ideology in literature is bourgeois realism. People who spread the above propositions in China talk about "deepening realism" and "rigorous realism"; while foreign modern revisionists advocate "enlightened realism" and "boundless realism," which ultimately means "realism without adjectives." What adjectives are they against? It is the adjective "revolutionary." This is of course not just a question of adjectives, they are against the proletarian revolution. This is of course not just a question of literary creation methods. In our proletarian revolutionary era, if bourgeois realism is revered as a deity, in fact, it can only allow bourgeois ideology to occupy the literary front. We must recognize the surging new tide of the times, which will surely break down the old limitations. Realism, as a literary heritage, we must inherit it, but we must inherit it critically. Inheritance is for creation, for opening up our own road. Today, the great changes of fundamental nature have taken place in social life, how can the creative methods that reflect it not change accordingly! The positive factors of bourgeois realism, we absorb them, the negative factors, we criticize them, but as a creative method, if it remains unchanged, then it is not suitable for reflecting our socialist real life. However, some people are unable to extricate themselves from the influence of inherited forces. Others are wholeheartedly calling for the souls of these already dead things. This exactly shows their bourgeois essence, which is to stubbornly maintain the monopoly and rule of the bourgeoisie in the literary field. The socialist revolution in the literary field that we are carrying out must make a thorough break with various bourgeois concepts. This inevitably includes the criticism of bourgeois realism. However, not only in theory do some people use bourgeois realism to oppose the creative method of combining proletarian revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism. At the same time, in creation, in addition to anti-socialist poisonous weeds, there is also a serious phenomenon that deserves attention. That is, using the bourgeois realist creative method to reflect the current real life has reached the point of being incompatible. The facts prove that this set of stale methods can no longer fully praise our new era and our new heroes. Compared with

    《欧阳海之歌》是共产主义的战歌
    刘白羽
    一《欧阳海之歌》的出现，是毛泽东思想在文艺战线上的巨大胜利。它说明无产阶级革命文学，正排挞一切，锋利前进。它是一座新的里程碑，标志着我国社会主义文学进入一个新的历史阶段。
    读这部书时，心情是不能不激动的。但一页一页地读下去，一种更强大的思想力量吸引了我。这是有如一轮朝日一样庄严的、壮丽的共产主义的理想。欧阳海这个崭新的人，就正在这个通红理想光辉之中，饱含微笑，满怀信心，昂然前进。是的，这是一个欧阳海，但也不只是一个欧阳海，而是我们整个时代，整个革命，在以震撼世界的英雄姿态在前进。那炽烈的革命热情，那冷静的求实精神，那狂风暴雨般的搏斗，那惊心动魄的思想斗争，一切一切，我们时代的声音、容貌，都一下汇集在我们眼前了。《欧阳海之歌》为什么会有这么强大的力量？我看最主要的是它塑造了最深刻、最充分地体现出我们无产阶级革命理想的英雄人物。
    正如作者所说：
          “英雄和英雄行为，不是一个抽象的概念，它无不打上鲜明
    的时代和阶级烙印。”
    欧阳海身上的鲜明的烙印，也就是我们的时代、我们的阶级、我们的革命最本质的本质，概括起来一句话，就是欧阳海是一个以当代马克思列宁主义发展的顶峰——毛泽东思想武装起来的人。
    我们衡量任何一部文学作品，看它是否达到这个时代的高峰，首先不是看它有多少离奇的情节，美丽的词藻，首先看它是否达到这个时代的新的思想的高峰。我们的时代是无产阶级革命的时代，我们的英雄是社会主义、共产主义的英雄。欧阳海这个人物的典型意义，就在于他是具有我们时代最先进最革命的思想，闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的新人，因而他是我们的时代精华，他是我们的当代英雄，他是我们的学习典范。
    今天，我们处在资本主义、帝国主义最后灭亡，社会主义、共产主义最后胜利的时代。站在这个时代洪流最前列，推动历史车轮向光明道路前进的，必然是为这个时代最伟大的思想所武装起来的最大无畏的新人。我国社会主义革命是一场伟大的斗争。由于无产阶级革命的深入，时代变了，社会变了，人也变了。欧阳海正如雷锋、王杰一样，以其无比的光芒，以其强大的威力，庄严地宣布：共产主义理想在中国现实生活中具体实现了。这是一种特殊材料构成的人，他们毫不利己，专门利人，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为革命，全心全意为人民服务，他们胸怀坦荡，无所畏惧，赴汤蹈火，坚贞不屈。面对这波涛汹涌风雷激荡的世界革命伟大潮流，什么是这时代新生的决定命运的力量？最大的战斗力就是勇敢，不怕死。最厉害的武器是毛泽东思想。当毛泽东思想为广大人民所掌握，就会变成摧枯拉朽，所向披靡，永远无敌于天下的力量。欧阳海这一英雄形象所代表的正是这新生的、先进的、革命的力量。
    从这个意义上来说，《欧阳海之歌》的诞生不是偶然的，首先它是伟大无产阶级革命现实的产物，同时也是伟大无产阶级革命的精神产物。《欧阳海之歌》以高度思想力量与艺术力量，在文学作品中树立起这样一个共产主义思想光芒四射的英雄形象。因此，应该说《欧阳海之歌》在文学战线上，是一个突破，一个革命。《欧阳海之歌》与以往的文学作品有着本质的区别，它是突出政治、突出阶级斗争、突出毛泽东思想的书。它从思想内容到艺术形式都突破了资产阶级文学的限制与约束，而有所发现，有所发明，有所创造。总起来说：《欧阳海之歌》是按照毛泽东思想的指示，而创作出来的一部崭新的无产阶级革命文学作品，只有为毛泽东思想所武装起来的作者，才能比较完美地写出为毛泽东思想所武装起来的英雄。所以《欧阳海之歌》是为当前革命斗争服务，十分有力的武器。有人读了《欧阳海之歌》之后发出这样的誓言：“人应该这样生，路应该这样走。”这正说明《欧阳海之歌》的教育作用。
   二上面，谈到《欧阳海之歌》出色地塑造了社会主义时代的英雄典型形象。现在，我们再进一步来考察，《欧阳海之歌》所以获得巨大的成功，在于它不仅仅写欧阳海成为英雄，而在于写他怎样成为英雄。从全书来看，写欧阳海牺牲只占最后几页，作者以绝大部分篇幅去写欧阳海如何走向成为英雄的道路，这就决定作品不是去追求壮烈牺牲的情节与场景，而着力于追求所以能壮烈牺牲的巨大思想源泉。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，是生命线。正是把描写政治思想放在主要地位，这就使得《欧阳海之歌》不是一部廉价追求惊险情节的书，而是深刻地发掘我们时代的巨大思想力量的书。正因为这个缘故，从书的篇章上，时时感到阶级的脉搏，时代的脉搏，巨大思想的跃动的脉搏。
    欧阳海在童年，是一个很好的孩子，作为战士，也是一个出色的战士，但是放在社会主义、共产主义尺度上衡量，他还需要很大的前进，还需要通过一系列矛盾与斗争。想一想，这个在风雪交加、饥寒交迫、被人称作“老鸦窝”的贫困山村中，用苦水养大的孩子，他光着脚，从漫天风雪中走过来，而后，一步一个脚印，走到共产主义思想的高峰，这是多么伟大的历程啊！如果说第一章“风雪中”是一篇序诗，那么最后一节“南岳枫红”是一篇结尾的颂歌，这中间，作者正确而果断地用主要的精力去写欧阳海在尖锐、复杂的矛盾冲突中的思想成长，从一个已经难能可贵的高度，发展向一个更高更高的高度。
    最重要之点，就是《欧阳海之歌》所以写出一个毛泽东时代英雄，在于它真正写出了毛泽东思想如何塑造新人，而为毛泽东思想武装起来的新人又发挥出多么伟大的力量。
    在书的前半部，不仅写出欧阳海有着强烈的阶级仇恨，顽强的斗争意志，同时也大胆地揭开欧阳海争强好胜，一心想当英雄，想冒尖的缺点。这提供了欧阳海要成为真正无产阶级英雄，既有能以突破、能以飞跃的条件，又有必须突破、必须飞跃的限制，因而在书的后半部，就更深入地探索到欧阳海只有既参加社会上兴无灭资的斗争，而更重要的是展开自己头脑中的兴无灭资的斗争，才能走向更高发展的道路。这就是说，虽然欧阳海出身于贫苦农民的家庭，自己又一心一意朝革命道路上飞奔猛进，可是“任何事物的内部都有其新旧两个方面的矛盾，形成为一系列的曲折的斗争。”（《矛盾论》）作者抓住了这个内在的矛盾，就抓住了欧阳海发展前进的动力，从而揭示了欧阳海这个人物的精神生活、内心世界、灵魂深处。
      《欧阳海之歌》正由于展示了欧阳海这个人的惊心动魄的思想斗争，自我革命，才产生了这部书的惊心动魄的思想力量。欧阳海的成长、成熟，是在一九六○年军委扩大会议作出“关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议”之后，全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治工作，提倡四个第一（人的因素第一，政治工作第一，思想工作第一，活的思想第一）条件下成长、成熟的。欧阳海怎样才成为我们时代的英雄呢？要回答这个问题，就看欧阳海心中那强烈的阶级仇恨的火种，怎样点燃成为无产阶级觉悟的火花，怎样点燃成为共产主义思想的火花，使一个人从必然王国走向自由王国。在这艰险的思想斗争的历程中，“关键的关键”是党、是毛泽东思想，启发了欧阳海的阶级觉悟、自我革命的精神，而使他战胜了，老实说，比任何艰难困苦还要严重的艰难困苦；他终于在自己头脑中这场阶级搏斗里取得了胜利。跟随高度自觉性而来的高度原则性，把一个普通的但又是出色的战士进一步培养成为一个正如欧阳海生前所说：“如果需要为共产主义理想而牺牲，我们每一个人，都应该，也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳”这样纯洁、坚定的社会主义、共产主义的战士。
    作者以鲜明的形象化手法反映了人的精神变化，从始至终，紧紧抓住思想斗争、思想成长这根红线，一步比一步紧，一步比一步严，一步比一步高，构成书中人与人的关系，构成书中的情节冲突，构成书中的主题思想，可以说，一步比一步深刻，一步比一步动人心弦，而每一动人心弦之处，也就是对读者教益最深之处。
    如果说欧阳海一口气打二百八十铁锤，显示其毅力，震动全连队，这一节，已经把欧阳海这样一个非常可爱的战士，象雕塑一般突出在读者眼前。但笔锋一转，一个新的波澜展开了，更高的思想要求摆在他的面前。
    党在这关键时刻，看到他的优点，也看到一般不易觉察的缺点，党在考虑：这样一块好铁，怎样炼成一块纯钢呢？
  连指导员、党支部书记曾武军是按着毛主席的突出政治的建军思想培养出来的人。现在，一股阶级的、党的、革命部队传统作风的暖流，从他的身上，灌注到了欧阳海的心上。是党在严酷战斗中培养了曾武军，而曾武军现在亲手领着年青的欧阳海，把他引上了比自己更高，更前进的道路。
    《欧阳海之歌》透过许多平凡生活小事，却使人物投入激烈的火热的思想斗争。当然，铁矿石是不能自己变成钢的，它需要烈火烧，它需要铁锤打，熔铁通红，火花飞溅，然后才能成为纯钢。书中有两段，可以说是这部书中最珍贵的收获。一段是“响鼓也用重锤敲”。当连里考虑派谁去参加民兵积极分子比武大会作刺杀示范表演时，多数支委主张欧阳海去，因为论刺杀技术，他是全连最拔尖的。最后，作为支部书记的曾武军，用一分为二的观点，针对欧阳海争强好胜的缺点，认为“荣誉对他目前来说没有什么好处”，决定派刘伟成，而不派欧阳海。曾武军说：“欧阳海凭他淳朴的阶级感情出发，为什么革命这个问题已经基本解决。怎么革命，怎么才能象毛主席教导的那样作一个纯粹的人，这还要靠他自己努力，靠我们支部多花点心血呢！”果然，严重的考验落到欧阳海头上了。当宣布这一决定时，充满荣誉感的欧阳海，“低着头没有吱声”。当大操场上，大伙儿帮助刘伟成练习刺杀时，欧阳海独自坐在屋里看书。大伙儿都在比赛中败在刘伟成手下，连长关英奎上阵，也只打成平局。但是关英奎看出了刘伟成的弱点，为了更好地帮助刘伟成，他去找欧阳海。欧阳海不肯去，连长强拉了他去。于是，刀光闪闪，激动人心的场面出现了。欧阳海憋着一股劲，可是这一个一心向上的战士，那里意识到这三枪是多么充满个人意识的三枪啊！他一连三枪，就象一个战士所说：“这是我所见到的最精彩、最最精彩的三枪。”结果是三比○。刘伟成一个人孤零零地站在那里，欧阳海一转眼已经不见了。随后，一场激烈的思想搏斗，把读者引入更高的境界。曾武军来到欧阳海面前——这真是敲鼓的重锤呀！——欧阳海从来没见过指导员这样激动，欧阳海从来没受过这么严厉的批评。因为曾武军看到欧阳海头脑中消极的因素，如若让它占上风，它就会毁掉这个战士，如若消除它，这个战士就会飞跃前进。曾武军说：“就算是荣誉，欧阳海，我们一个革命者是从来不去计较它的。我们要比对党的忠诚，比全心全意为人民服务的思想，我们从来不和自己的同志比荣誉。”然后，他讲述了连长在过去一次战斗中，和另一个同志互让缴一挺重机枪的功劳。指导员每一句话，每一个字，都象一支支枪直奔他的心窝，直刺在他的痛处。可是当他抬起头时，指导员不在了，站在他面前的是文书，原来指导员不肯在干部登记表内填立功受奖这一栏，他已躲走了。显然，那一次和连长互让功劳的就是指导员自己。这真是电闪雷鸣一般出色的描写啊！如果说上面这段批评是重锤，现在，就让我们进一步看看“响鼓”吧！深夜，欧阳海痛苦得睡不着，他借着手电的亮光，在自己的膝盖上，满含着羞愧的泪珠，给支部写检讨。他认识了，他立刻就见诸行动，这里写出欧阳海这面鼓，真是一面咚咚响的鼓啊！在晨光曦微的时候，他就主动找刘伟成在操场上帮助他练习刺杀了。
    看，作者是怎样由一件具体的事例，一下就深入到人物的思想深处，揭开事物的内在秘密，突出了毛泽东思想教育人，突出了人的自觉性。
    曾武军在一个狂风暴雨之夜在工地抢险中，右臂折断，身负重伤，他不得不离开连队，送往医院。这时他的呼吸越来越急促，但话音里满含着爽朗的声调。在这情况下，他代表党支部吸收欧阳海入了党。曾武军留给欧阳海的是三本《毛泽东选集》，是“要反对形形色色的资产阶级思想，……首先在自己思想里打个胜仗”的叮嘱。对，是激烈的战斗啊！扶着欧阳海的手前进的曾武军离去了，但从此欧阳海走上了一条真正忘“我”，追求真理、激烈战斗的兴无灭资的道路。他带着高度的阶级自觉性，如饥如渴地读着毛主席著作，而且按着毛主席的指示，一件一件事的具体实践，他的脚步放稳了，他还是那样刚强，他却更显得纯朴了，他走上做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人的道路。他可以扬帆远航了。
    如果说前面那一段已经接触到欧阳海思想的内核，那么，第八、九两章“新的考验”与“迎着烈火冲上去”就达到了全书的高潮。这表现在欧阳海处理他和副指导员薛新文的关系的问题上。这是一场唯物主义和唯心主义的尖锐斗争，薛新文心是好的，但他不调查研究，就把“骄傲自满”的帽子扣在欧阳海头上，他就这样主观主义地怀着对欧阳海以及对战士刘延生的误解，对欧阳海进行着他的“帮助”。——这是一场复杂的斗争，实质上，是两种不同的世界观的斗争，但它牵连到领导与被领导，原则与无原则的斗争，……现在，沿着揭示事物内部矛盾这一条思想斗争线索发展下来，比前面所有的考验都更复杂的考验摆在欧阳海的面前。这时的欧阳海已经是一个能以从远大革命理想出发，照亮自己前进道路的人了。如果说前半段欧阳海还处于“必然的王国”状态，现在，他已走向“自由的王国”，他懂得要处理这问题还是不容易的，何况，这个问题处理得好不好，关系到的是整个连队是前进还是后退，能不能更好地为革命战斗在最前线这样一个大问题呢！但，正是在这个关节上，欧阳海这个共产主义一代新人的典型臻于完美的地步了。欧阳海摒除了个人私念，他是既坚持了高度原则性，又坚持了与人为善的精神，既进行了严肃的斗争，又作到了热情的帮助。在关系到刘延生的问题上，他曾经毫不隐蔽自己的见解，以高度原则性和无畏精神，找副指导员面对面提出了意见，提出了批评。当他自己处处带头，忍耐着烧伤的手心的疼痛，坚持繁重的劳动，不下“火线”（当然这一切都被薛新文的主观主义所蒙遮而并不了解的），反而遭到误解，同班的战士为此意见纷纭。想一想，这在一个人的思想上是一个怎样的轩然大波呀！可是欧阳海耐心地在班的会议上严肃地指出：一个战士要从积极方面理解上级的批评或表扬，而且他“一分为二”地指出了副指导员在劳动中的积极带头作用。一个人任劳不容易，任怨更不容易。欧阳海这时，不仅仅是为了维护领导，而是维护整个革命的团结，他胸怀坦荡，毫无怨尤，真正达到了彻底的唯物主义者无所畏惧的程度。经过毛泽东思想的塑造，欧阳海已是一个有着共产主义风格的人，已经是站在我们时代最前列的人。这一场党性的决斗，思想的交锋，所达到的思想高度成为全书中最精采的两章。为毛泽东思想武装起来的人，不但在暴风雨式的工地战斗中发挥出伟大的力量，而且在惊涛骇浪的思想建设中发挥出伟大的力量。
    作者写了欧阳海的思想的斗争、成长、成熟，作用，到这里已经完成了塑造一个高大共产主义英雄形象的任务。这样的人，可以设想，在一旦遇到革命斗争需要时，他必然会义不反顾，挺身而起。自然也就用不到再去详尽细致地描写欧阳海英勇牺牲的情节和场景了，而只用最后一刹那那一曲庄严的、革命的颂歌，结束了全书。正如作者所说：“在这短短时间内，也许他什么也没有说，什么也没有想，什么也没有看见，什么也没有听到。但是，有一个信念在推动着他：决不能让人民的生命财产受到损失！为共产主义理想献身的时刻到了！共产党员应该冲上前去！”
    欧阳海从凤凰村走进部队，他一心一意想作一个董存瑞那样的战斗英雄，这不是理想吗？这是一个很好的理想。但当他的阶级觉悟的火焰点燃了，他记牢指导员的叮嘱，产生了新的信念：如果能抛弃一切个人私念，全心全意为党，为革命，为人民，那怕胸前没有奖章，那怕没有得到立功喜报，那他也是一个真正的英雄了。这时他有了真正远大的理想。是的，欧阳海一心一意要当个出色英雄时，他还没有成为一个真正的英雄；当他在自己平凡岗位上，一心一意为革命而踏踏实实工作时，他终于成为一个真正的英雄。这样的英雄，不仅仅是有着勇敢的行为的人，而且首先是有着巨大的共产主义思想力量、精神力量的人。这就把我们社会主义文学中的英雄形象，提高到一个新的高度上来了。
    三《欧阳海之歌》对于人物形象，现实生活，以至历史的进程的描写都是非常真实的，其中许多章节，达到了绘声绘色，栩栩如生的程度，但只这一方面，还不能说明这部书的艺术特点，问题是每一真实的细节，又都统一在一种非常鼓舞人心的、豪迈的、理想的光辉之中。这就构成了《欧阳海之歌》的充满革命激情、调子高昂，非常政治化、非常艺术化的新的艺术风格。
    它，敢于放手写旧社会的苦难生活。那为茫茫风雪所掩盖、充满饥馑与死亡的“老鸦窝”，贫穷的人们已经濒于灭亡的边缘，最后一寸土地被夺走了，可怜的四妹子被饿死了。你能说这一切不凄惨吗？不颤动人的心弦吗？但这一切并没使人们被悲伤戚厉所压倒，作者写出欧阳海一家人的阶级仇恨的怒火与顽强不屈。写出了贫苦人民的可贵的品质。
    它，敢于放手写矛盾，写人民内部的矛盾，甚至是军队内部，党内部的矛盾，写英雄人物本身的矛盾，写缺点，写错误，而且放在阶级斗争的尺度上来衡量。象前面所举的两段，一段是写欧阳海自己头脑中的思想搏斗，一段写他和领导者副指导员薛新文之间的一场思想搏斗。难道矛盾不尖锐吗？是的，不但尖锐而且艰巨。但这一切没有使人们产生“暴露黑暗”或“渲染阴暗面”之感，而相反，通过思想交锋，使人物的思想境界，精神状态，更加丰富，更加饱满了。
    它，敢于写死亡——欧阳海被巨大的火车卷进车轮底下，倒在血泊之中，……书中不但写了同志们令人心碎的呼喊声，而且峡谷里都回响着一片哀痛，湘江的流水，四周的群山，都发出了悲切的呼应。这样的牺牲，你说不沉痛，不热泪盈眶吗？但他不使人们停留在死亡的痛苦，伤痛的磨折，如果它使人读了流泪，但，这绝不是消沉，而是激励。满山枫叶映照得一片鲜红，列车震撼着山川大地轰隆隆奔走，在他遗留下来的笔记本上清晰地写着：“即使有一天，这个世界上没有了我，我也仍然衷心地相信：共产主义的理想必然胜利，一定会有更多更多觉醒了的人为它战斗！”使人觉得欧阳海虽死犹生，象从第一章就象征性地描叙过的那棵从苦难年月中悄悄地在增加着一圈一圈的年轮的青松。结尾时，作者又一次象征性地写道：“就在这个时候，一缕阳光照在凤凰村的山头上。那棵笔直的青松在阳光下挺立着。大雨刚刚洗过了它的全身，它显得更翠绿、挺拔，……”而“青松下，无数棵松果已破土出芽，一排排茁壮的小松苗正在阳光下成长”。作者把人们从欧阳海的牺牲，带向更高更远的方向。
      《欧阳海之歌》不回避矛盾，不回避困苦，不回避死亡，而使这一切都转化成为强大的思想力量，强大的艺术力量，它感染人、提高人，我觉得最主要之点，是作者是带着深厚的无产阶级感情来写的。只有站在无产阶级立场的高度，站在毛泽东思想的高度，也就是“站在共产主义这一时代最高理想的峰顶来观察生活、描写生活”（周扬：《我国社会主义文学艺术的道路》），才是这部书巨大艺术感染力的根源的根源。也只有从这个起点开始，一个作者才能走向革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作的道路。
    我们社会主义时代的“愚公移山”精神，不是充满革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义的吗？解放军精神，大庆精神，大寨精神，不是充满革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义的吗？林彪同志说过：“我们的党是无产阶级的先锋队，其所以朝气勃勃，所以不腐化，就是因为我们的哲学是斗争的哲学，是保证我们不断前进的哲学，保证我们生气勃勃的哲学。”这革命的哲学，把冷静的科学分析和热烈的革命精神结合起来，所以无产阶级革命者在困难时看到光明，在牺牲时看到胜利，一个革命者在任何时候，任何情况下，都为一种崇高的理想、崇高的向往所鼓舞着。
    艺术上的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义来源于现实生活中的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义。一个作者只有以毛泽东思想为指针，有真正的无产阶级立场、思想、感情，——有斗争的哲学，有求实的精神，细致地、深刻地观察生活，而又高瞻远瞩，满怀理想，这样才能把革命的激情与真实的描写交织起来。创作方法绝不仅仅是写作技术，它是包含从观察生活到创造表现这一生活内容的最新颖、最理想的形式。一个无产阶级革命时代的作家，只有真正深刻理解自己时代、自己时代的人，而又具有最先进最革命的思想，才能大胆创造，花样翻新，开创我们一代新的文风，创造出表达无产阶级革命时代精神面貌的独特艺术形式，只有有了真正无产阶级的世界观、艺术观，才能掌握真正无产阶级的艺术方法。如果只从资产阶级文学史中，按照抽象定义，去解释革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合，那是纸上谈兵，谈一百年也掌握不了这一革命的创作方法。如果你不听任资产阶级那一套摆布，你敢于突破他们的框框，有无产阶级立场、有毛泽东思想，你才能敏锐地深入到革命人民现实生活的本质，精神生活的本质，你才能运用革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合这最好的创作方法，才能把我们的时代风姿，革命面貌表现得既真实精确，又意气昂扬。只有作者是一个最清醒的革命现实主义者，又是最富于理想的革命理想者，他才能用冷静的分析与革命的豪情来观察生活，来反映生活。
    《欧阳海之歌》的艺术特色，就在于把无产阶级斗争的哲学和革命的诗意紧密结合起来。因此，我说这部书是一部难得的、有着“国际歌”传统风格的书，它闪烁着革命思想的闪光，也闪烁着革命艺术的闪光。所以有这样的艺术感染力，前面已经说到与作者有着深厚的阶级感情这一点是分不开的。事实说明，只有解决了这个根本的阶级立场问题，你的思想感情才能自由奔放，你的想象力才能自由驰骋。正是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，使得《欧阳海之歌》成为一部艺术色彩绚烂、清新明丽的书。有的章节是优美的抒情诗，有的章节是色泽鲜明的油画，有的章节是雄伟的颂歌，而更重要的，贯穿全局，是一部充满豪迈的语言，鲜明的色彩，雄壮的格调，非常革命化、战斗化的书。因此不论怎样变化，甚至在一个细节中，作者笔锋里也常常含蓄着、蕴藏着非常动人的深厚的阶级感情和崇高的革命理想。我想举一个例子来说明：全书将近结尾，连长关英奎把欧阳海将被调往一个国防工厂去工作的消息告诉了他，而连长马上要去接新兵，他们两人就要分手了。这时关英奎摘下胸前的钢笔送给欧阳海，这里有一段描写：
    “‘我可不是要送你一支笔啊！’关英奎指着脑后的那块伤疤说，‘一九四八年在黑山完成了阻击任务之后，我负了伤，团政委——就是咱们今天的老政委奖给我这支笔，让我好好学习。那时候我连扁担倒在地上也不知道是个“一”字，就靠这支笔，学会了写“共产党万岁”，写了入党申请书。可是我的脑子受了震动，进步一直不大……你马上要走向新的岗位了，带上这支笔吧。’……关英奎拿起行装朝团部走去。欧阳海抚摸着手上那支黑杆的老式钢笔，笔杆上留着几道槽槽，这是被关英奎的大手捏出来的，它生动地记载着连长在学习上的顽强劲儿。这时，他似乎更深地懂得了连长的心意。”
    这是一个细节，但经过作者的几笔刻画，一股无产阶级的阶级感情和崇高理想立刻冲入你的心里。紧接着，在一段野营生活之中，欧阳海就英勇地献出了自己的生命。不少评论文章，高度评价最后牺牲的那短短的一刹那的描写，但这不是孤立的，只有由于整个的创作方法是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，到最后才能够迸发出最高的革命的激情，才给读者留下无穷的向往。欧阳海的生命结束了，《欧阳海之歌》结束了，但一曲共产主义之歌在你心中永远波澜壮阔回旋激荡。
                                  四
    除了从思想性与艺术性方面评价《欧阳海之歌》外，我们说《欧阳海之歌》所以是一部崭新的书，真正无产阶级革命文学的书，还必须充分估计到它在文学战线上，是对国内资产阶级文艺思想、是对国外现代修正主义文艺思想，非常雄辩有力的批判。
    意识形态领域的阶级斗争是尖锐的。是塑造无产阶级、社会主义时代的光辉英雄形象，还是把各种过了时的、资产阶级灰暗的小人物充塞在社会主义的文学作品中，这是用无产阶级世界观还是用资产阶级世界观改造世界的根本问题，是为无产阶级服务，还是为资产阶级服务的根本问题。
    苏联现代修正主义文学，已经堕落成为背叛无产阶级革命的文学。他们提倡“非英雄化”“小真实”，特别是在描写战争的作品中，以“战壕的真实”为借口，公开宣扬卑鄙无耻的叛徒心理，他们背叛而且诽谤那些在十月革命和反法西斯战争中流血牺牲的英雄，而把战争，把牺牲，写成一片阴暗凄凉。他们拾西方资产阶级反动颓废文学的余唾，来污染、腐蚀社会主义国家人民的心灵，修正主义文学是为修正主义的政治服务的，他们的政治目的就是窒息人民的革命精神，瓦解人民的斗争意志。
    在我国社会主义革命进程中，还存在着阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争必然也十分复杂而尖锐地反映在文学方面。十几年来，有人提倡写劳动人民的“精神奴役的创伤”，有人提倡把“大量存在着的”“庸庸碌碌的人们”作文学作品的“重要的主人公”，有人提倡“写中间人物”写“不好不坏，亦好亦坏，中不溜儿的芸芸众生”，写“几千年来个体农民的精神负担”，写人民思想改造的“苦难历程”，这些无非是“非英雄化”的另一种讲法，把“中间人物”——也就是资产阶级小人物推到文学创作的主要位置上，用以来否定社会主义、共产主义的新英雄形象。这是反对社会主义的一股潮流在文学方面的表现。毫无疑问，这种主张是为资产阶级政治服务的，按照他们的主张写的人物，只能引导人民离开社会主义道路，而走向资本主义道路。
    值得我们注意的是，无论是国内资产阶级文艺思想，还是国外现代修正主义文艺思想，它们在文学上一个共同的指导思想，就是资产阶级的现实主义。在中国散布上述主张的人，讲“现实主义深化”“严谨的现实主义”；而国外现代修正主义者提倡“开明的现实主义”“无边无际的现实主义”，归根到底就是“不要形容词的现实主义”。他们所反对的形容词是什么形容词呢？就是“革命”这个形容词。这当然不仅仅是一个形容词的问题，他们反对的是无产阶级革命。这当然也不仅仅是一个文学创作方法问题，在我们无产阶级革命时代，把资产阶级现实主义奉若神明，事实上，只能是让资产阶级思想占领文学阵地。我们必须认识到波涛汹涌的新时代潮流，它必定冲垮旧的限制。现实主义，作为一种文学遗产，我们是要继承的，但是，要批判地继承，继承是为了创造，是为了开辟自己的道路。今天，社会生活发生了根本性质的大变革，反映它的创作方法，怎么能不随之而变革呢！资产阶级现实主义积极的因素，我们吸收，消极的因素，我们批判，但作为创作方法，一成不变，那就不适用于反映我们社会主义的现实生活了。可是一些人受着因袭势力的影响，未能自拔。另外一些人则死心踏地为这已经僵死的东西招魂。这正好说明他们的资产阶级实质，就是在文艺领域里顽强地保持资产阶级的垄断与统治。我们所进行的文学方面的社会主义革命，就必须同资产阶级种种观念进行彻底的决裂。其中必然包括对资产阶级现实主义的批判。但是，不仅在理论上，有人用资产阶级的现实主义反对无产阶级的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法。同时，在创作中，除了反社会主义的毒草之外，还有一严重现象，值得注意。就是用资产阶级现实主义创作方法，反映当前的现实生活，已经到了格格不入的地步。事实证明，用这一套陈腐的方法，已不能充分地歌颂我们的新时代，歌颂我们的新英雄。与豪情壮志，丰富多采的生活比一比，这些作品就显得黯然失色了。新的时代提出了新的要求，从文艺理论，到创作方法，我们都需要进行一次大变革，破资产阶级，立无产阶级，才能跟上时代，作时代的歌手。我们的文学才能走自己的道路，走毛泽东文艺思想的道路。
    我们的社会主义文学，是真正无产阶级文学。毛主席号召我们：“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”在社会主义革命大时代，我们的革命文学工作者必须和这个时代新的群众相结合，我们的社会主义文学，才能是真正无产阶级文学。
    文学领域的阶级斗争，不但要用文学理论武器来进行批判，还要用文学创作这个武器来进行批判。《欧阳海之歌》塑造了欧阳海这个彻里彻外，鲜红通明的共产主义英雄典型形象，这不就是对种种“非英雄化”的资产阶级现实主义荒谬理论的一个沉重打击，一个有力的批判吗？
    在文章开头的地方谈到《欧阳海之歌》是文学方面的一个突破，一个革命。现在突破口已经打开，新的道路已经开辟，那么，我们的社会主义文学，就应该沿着这个突破口，扩大战果，发展前进。要做到这一点，最根本的问题，就是我们的革命作家必须真正学习毛泽东思想。学毛主席著作而不到生活实践中去，不行！到工农兵群众中去而不能以毛泽东思想为指导去认识生活，也不行！只有投身于群众火热斗争而又活学活用毛泽东思想，这才是走我们自己的社会主义文学、真正无产阶级文学道路的根本出发点。只有这样不断学习，不断革命，不断前进，与不断发展的时代作不断深入的结合，才能真正熟悉这个时代，理解这个时代，热爱这个时代，反映这个时代，写出为千千万万人所学习的英雄榜样。
    《欧阳海之歌》创造了为当前革命政治斗争服务，从精神上用毛泽东思想教育人的范例。当然，并不是说《欧阳海之歌》已经尽美尽善，没有缺点，比如有些人物写得还不够突出，有些描写还感到冗长，作者在自己开阔的道路上，当然还应该更虚心学习，刻苦钻研，以努力攀上更高的高峰。但《欧阳海之歌》是革命的新生事物，它标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，对于它从思想内容到艺术形式已经达到的新的高度，作充分的估价，正是为了我国社会主义文学更大的突飞猛进，更深刻地反映我们的时代精神面貌，更有力地扫荡封建主义、资本主义的牛鬼蛇神，用共产主义精神教育人，用毛泽东思想教育人，以为国内革命，为世界革命，为共产主义理想的实现而奋斗。
    读《欧阳海之歌》时，我重温了毛主席关于共产主义思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于世界，而葆其美妙之青春这一段话。我觉得我们的无产阶级革命文学，在社会主义、共产主义与资本主义、帝国主义决战之中，不仅仅是颂歌，而应该是战歌。《欧阳海之歌》就是共产主义的战歌，它可以鼓舞人踏着欧阳海的脚印前进，象欧阳海那样为共产主义而战。我读完《欧阳海之歌》，在最后一页上写下四句话，现在就把它作为这篇文章的结束语吧：
    滚滚酣雷歌壮志，茫茫烈火喜丰姿，
    放眼全球多激荡，风云雷电写新诗。
