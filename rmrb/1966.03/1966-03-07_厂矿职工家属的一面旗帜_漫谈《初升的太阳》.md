	A Banner for Factory and Mine Workers' Families
	——A Discussion of "Rising Sun"
	Yi Bing

	On the eve of this "March 8th" International Women's Day, the families of Daqing workers came to Beijing to give a report performance of "Rising Sun," which was warmly welcomed by the audience. This is not an ordinary artistic performance, but a vivid and graphic report by the builders of Daqing to the Party and the people of the capital on their revolutionization, which gave us great education and inspiration.

	Those who have seen "Rising Sun" praise them for acting "like" the real thing. This comment is well made! The word "like" seems simple, but it is not easy to achieve. "Like" is not a direct copy of real life, but an artistic generalization of life by the author, a unity of life and art. Because only in this way can it be both like life and yet higher, more intense, more typical, and more ideal than life. Because the Daqing worker families "actors" acted "like" the real thing, the audience forgot about the "play" and received a strong artistic effect.

	The Daqing worker families have not received professional training, so why do they act so well and so realistically? I think the most fundamental reason is that they are familiar with the characters in the play and love the characters in the play; more precisely, they themselves are participants in this struggle, and they are acting out their own or the things around them, so once they are pointed out by the directors, they can understand everything and act realistically and naturally. The comrade playing instructor Guo Deying said, "As soon as I get on stage, I think of our team instructor, Comrade Ma Lianfang, and Mother Xue." The comrade playing Xin Yuhong herself came from a poor family and begged for food with her mother when she was a child. Every time she performed the scene of remembering bitterness, she couldn't help but shed tears. The person playing Tie Dan's mother is the instructor of the production team herself, and she has encountered people like Tie Dan's mother in her work and knows their thoughts very well. She said, "If it weren't for acting out our own affairs, I wouldn't be able to act well, or act like the real thing, no matter what." The successful performance of the Daqing worker families gives our professional troupes a useful inspiration: to play the workers, peasants, and soldiers well, we must first be familiar with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, love the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and truly and permanently devote ourselves to the fiery struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to achieve a thorough and complete transformation.

	From "Rising Sun," we can clearly see that the Daqing worker families are not a "burden" on the Daqing mining area, but a great force in building the Daqing mining area. Those who have been to Daqing know that Daqing families not only participate in agricultural production, but also participate in industrial labor in oil felt paper factories, automobile repair factories, instrument factories... As for the service personnel in the workers' and peasants' village canteens, grain stations, post offices, stores, etc., 95% or more are family members. Teachers in part-time work and part-time study schools are family members, and those who whip horses and herd cattle and sheep on the wasteland are family members. At the agricultural research station, family members are conducting agricultural scientific research; on the vast golden fields, family members are driving combine harvesters to harvest. Like the Daqing workers, the Daqing families have contributed their strength to the construction and development of the Daqing Oilfield and have become a banner for factory and mine worker families.

	The Daqing worker families have reached today's situation after experiencing a difficult struggle. "Rising Sun" vividly and realistically reflects this struggle. With the rapid development of the Daqing Oilfield, many new families came to Daqing. They came from different regions, had different living habits, and had different levels of ideological awareness. Housing was tight for a time, and the supply of materials increased. If they were not properly settled, it would directly affect the morale of the workers and the production of the oilfield. A very sharp and urgent question before the Daqing workers and their families was whether to spend a large amount of state investment to build a centralized consumer city; or to work hard, rely on their own efforts, and build workers' and peasants' villages in accordance with the principles of "combining industry and agriculture, combining urban and rural areas, benefiting production, and facilitating life"? Under the leadership of the Party, they resolutely chose the latter path. This is a path that no one has taken before. Can these sisters who came from "all corners of the country" with children break through the thorns? Not only were there shakers like Director Wang in the play, but even their own understanding was not consistent. Among the old families, there were of course "Guo Deying" who were tough in the revolution with five iron shovels, but there were also Tie Dan's mother-style figures; among the new families, there were mostly "Xin Yuhong"-style figures, but people like Lin Caiying were by no means one or two. But whether it is Tie Dan's mother or Lin Caiying, they are all descendants of the working people. Once they are thrown into this revolutionary furnace, once they are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will show extraordinary wisdom, superhuman perseverance, and selfless fighting spirit, and they will create amazing miracles.

	In the beginning of farming, they encountered all kinds of difficulties, but they found the source of strength to overcome all difficulties from Chairman Mao's works. For example, when Wang Lingmei, a family member of Fangxiao Er Village, was learning to plow, when she told the ox to go, it stopped; when she told it to stop, it rushed around, so the newly made ridges were broken and missing, causing water to flow straight from this field to that field. The water was deep and the mud was slippery. She fell several times, her whole body covered in mud, her head covered in sweat, and her feet were red with cold. Everyone advised her to rest for a while, but she said, "I can't rest. Perseverance to the end is victory." Now she has become a skilled veteran.

	The people who are constantly making revolution are not satisfied with being able to drive ox carts and hold plows, but also want to drive "iron oxen" and operate combine harvesters. In 1964, twenty-two young family members from the Red Satellite Workers' and Peasants' Village came to the mechanized farming team. They studied hard and practiced hard. Liu Xiuying even shouted in her dreams, "Step on the brake and disengage the clutch!" In half a month, they mastered the basic techniques of driving. By the end of 1965, the family mechanized farming team had grown to thirty-nine people, with twelve formal drivers managing fifty-six large-scale mechanized farming implements and thirteen tractors. In 1965, they completed 30,000 mu of mechanized farming tasks.

	After passing the agricultural barrier, the task of building workers' and peasants' villages was placed before the families. Could the families build "rammed earth" houses? In the beginning, it was still a mystery in many people's minds. Indeed, the difficulties were no less than agricultural production. However, these capable generals who had been trained in agriculture, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the leadership and support of the Party, with the guidance and help of experienced masters, and with the ambition to create a revolutionary cause and follow a revolutionary road, had the drive and momentum that could not be overwhelmed or stopped by any difficulties. When the eighth production team of Red Satellite built the first "rammed earth" house, the walls were not smooth, and some people said, "The family members still want to build their own houses?" But they were not intimidated by the difficulties and resolutely pushed them down and re-rammed them. They said: We must build a family team with good ideology, good style, and good technology; we must build the ambition and aspirations of the family members; we must build a model of self-reliance and hard work; and we must create a path for building mining areas with Mao Zedong Thought. When the family housing construction team of Chuangye Er Village was putting up the beam for the first time, they did not do it well twice due to lack of experience, and some people were so anxious that they shed tears. Zhang Zhongying said: "Don't be discouraged. We must show the tenacious perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and the revolutionary spirit of persisting to the end, and we must put the beam up well!" In 1965 alone, the Daqing families, together with the workers, built 300,000 square meters of "rammed earth" houses.

	There are countless "romantic figures" among the Daqing worker families, and heroic deeds are inexhaustible! Everything reflected in the drama "Rising Sun" can find its prototype in real life. In this sense, "Rising Sun" is a mirror of the Daqing worker families. This is not to belittle the artistic value of this drama. Lenin said it well, a great writer should reflect certain essential aspects of the revolution in his works. The drama "Rising Sun" more profoundly reflects the essential revolutionary spirit of the Daqing worker families.

	In 1965, the year of the all-round leap forward, the Daqing worker families took another big step forward. We sincerely wish them to forge ahead on the road of laborization, collectivization, and revolutionization! (Attached picture)
	They have won the red flag in agricultural production and will also launch an assault on the construction of workers' and peasants' villages. Look! They are writing letters of determination to the Party with full confidence.

    厂矿职工家属的一面旗帜
    ——漫谈《初升的太阳》
    艺兵
    在这“三八”节前夕，大庆职工家属来京汇报演出《初升的太阳》，受到观众的热烈欢迎。这不是一次普通的文艺演出，而是大庆的建设者们向党、向首都人民所作的关于他们革命化的生动形象的汇报，使我们受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。
    看了《初升的太阳》的人都赞扬他们演得“象”，这个评语下得好！一个“象”字，看来简单，做来并非容易。“象”不是现实生活的照搬，而是经过作者对生活的艺术概括，是生活和艺术的统一。因为只有这样，它才能既象生活，而又比生活更高，更强烈，更典型，更理想。大庆职工家属“演员”由于演得
  “象”，使观众忘了“戏”，收到了强烈的艺术效果。
    大庆职工家属并没有受过专业的训练，为啥演得这么好，这么象呢？我觉得最根本的一条就是她们熟悉剧中的人物，热爱剧中的人物；更确切地说，她们自己就是这场斗争的参加者，演的就是她们自己的或身边的事情，所以一经编导者指点就融会贯通，演起来真实自然。扮演指导员郭德英的同志说，我一上台就想起我队的指导员马莲芳同志和薛妈妈来。扮演辛玉红的同志自己就是穷苦人出身，小时跟妈一起讨过饭，每演到忆苦那场眼泪禁不住就流出来。演铁旦妈的自己就是生产队的指导员，在工作中不乏碰到过铁旦妈这样的人，对她们的思想摸得一清二楚。她说，要不是演我们自己的事，说啥我也演不好，演不象。大庆职工家属成功的演出，给我们专业剧团一个有益的启发：要演好工农兵，首先应该熟悉工农兵，热爱工农兵，真正长期地投身到工农兵火热斗争中去，来一个彻头彻尾、彻里彻外的化。
    从《初升的太阳》中我们可以清楚地看到：大庆职工家属不是大庆矿区的“包袱”，而是建设大庆矿区的一支伟大力量。到过大庆的人都知道，大庆家属不但参加了农业生产，而且也参加了油毡纸厂、汽车修理厂、仪表厂……的工业劳动。至于工农村的食堂、粮站、邮政、商店等服务人员百分之九十五以上是家属。半工半读学校的老师有家属，荒原上扬鞭策马牧牛羊的是家属。农业研究站上，家属们在进行农业科学的研究；在广阔的金色原野上，家属正驾驶着联合收割机在收割。大庆家属象大庆职工一样，在建设和开发大庆油田中贡献了自己的力量，成为厂矿职工家属的一面旗帜。
    大庆职工家属达到今天这样的境地，是经历过一场艰苦的斗争的。《初升的太阳》生动而真实地反映了这一斗争历程。随着大庆油田的迅速开发，许多新家属来到了大庆。她们来的地区不同，生活习惯不一，思想觉悟也高低不同，房子一时紧张，物资供应增加，如果安置不好，就会直接影响职工情绪和油田生产。摆在大庆职工和家属面前一个非常尖锐而迫切需要回答的问题，是花费国家大量投资建设集中的消费城市；还是艰苦奋斗、自力更生，本着
  “工农结合，城乡结合，有利生产，方便生活”的原则建设工农村？她们在党的领导下，坚决地选择了后一条道路。这一条路是前人没有走过的路。这些来自“五湖四海”的拖儿带女的姐妹们，能不能披荆斩棘闯过来？不仅有象剧中王主任那样的摇头者，就连她们自己的认识也不是一致的。在老家属中固然有五把铁锨闹革命的“过得硬”（郭德英），可也有铁旦妈式的人物；在新家属中固然多是“心里红”（辛玉红）式的人物，但象林彩英这样的人也绝非一二。但是不管是铁旦妈也好，林彩英也好，她们都是劳动人民的后代，一经投入这个革命的熔炉，一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就会表现出非凡的智慧、超人的毅力和忘我的斗争精神，就会创造出惊人的奇迹。
    在刚开始种地时，遇到了各种各样的困难，但她们从毛主席著作中找到了战胜一切困难的力量源泉。如方晓二村家属汪玲梅学扶犁时，叫牛走，它偏停，叫它停，它偏横冲直撞，因此把新打的埂弄得断断缺缺，使这块地里水直往那块地里流。水深泥滑，摔了几跤，浑身泥浆，满头大汗，两脚冻得通红。大家劝她休息一会，她说：“不能休息，坚持到底就是胜利。”现已成了过硬的老把式。
    不断革命的人们，并不满足于会赶牛车，扶犁杖，还要驾“铁牛”，开收割机。一九六四年红卫星工农村的二十二名青年家属来到机耕队。她们勤学苦练，刘秀英梦中还喊：“刹车踩离合器！”在半个月内她们就掌握了开车的基本技术。到一九六五年底家属机耕队已发展到三十九人，已有十二名正式司机，管理着五十六台大型机耕农具，十三台拖拉机，一九六五年完成了三万亩的机耕任务。
    在闯过农业关后，建设工农村的任务又摆在家属们面前，家属能不能建设“干打垒”？开始在许多人头脑中还是个谜。的确，其困难之多，绝不亚于农业生产。但是经过农业锻炼的这些干将们，由于有了毛泽东思想的武装，有党的领导和支持，有老师傅指导帮助，有创革命业、走革命路的雄心，也就有了任何困难压不倒、挡不住的干劲和冲力。红卫星第八生产队打第一座“干打垒”时，墙壁打得不光溜，有些人就说：“家属还想自己盖房子？”但她们没被困难吓倒，坚决推倒重打。她们说：要打出一支思想过硬、作风过硬、技术过硬的家属队伍来；要打出家属的雄心壮志来；要打出自力更生、艰苦奋斗的样板来；打出一条用毛泽东思想建设矿区的道路来。创业二村家属房建队在第一次上梁时，由于没有经验，两次都没有放好，有的人急得掉下泪来。张忠英说：“不要灰心，我们要拿出愚公移山的顽强毅力和坚持到底的革命精神，一定要把大梁上好！”在一九六五年一年中，大庆家属就跟职工一起，盖
  “干打垒”三十万平方米。
    在大庆职工家属中“风流人物”数不尽，英雄事迹是书不胜书的！话剧《初升的太阳》所反映的无一不可从现实生活中找到它的原型。从这个意义上说，《初升的太阳》是大庆职工家属的一面镜子。这样说，并不是贬低这一剧作的艺术价值，列宁说得好，一个伟大的作家，在他的作品里就应该反映出革命的某些本质方面来。话剧《初升的太阳》正是比较深刻地反映了大庆职工家属的本质的革命风貌。
    在全面跃进的一九六五年中，大庆职工家属们又大大地向前跨进了一步。衷心地祝愿她们在劳动化、集体化、革命化的道路上勇往直前！（附图片）
    她们在农业生产上夺得了红旗，还要在建设工农村上打冲锋。看！她们正信心百倍地向党写决心书。
