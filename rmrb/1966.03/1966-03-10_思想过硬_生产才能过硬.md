    With Solid Ideology, Production Can Be Solid
    With advanced work, is it no longer necessary to highlight politics? I think that with advanced work, it is even more necessary to highlight politics. Only by highlighting politics can we adhere to the correct direction, just like a locomotive must have a bright headlight, so that we can avoid accidents when driving in the dark.
    Our “Mao Zedong” locomotive crew has safely driven more than 1.8 million kilometers in the past twenty years, completing all transportation tasks every year. We have been able to achieve such results because we have highlighted politics and advanced while holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Without politics, it is impossible to move forward.
    In 1964, the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways awarded us the banner "Persist in Continuous Revolution, Always Be a Pioneer"; the Party Committee of the Ministry of Railways also made a decision to further promote the "Mao Zedong" experience throughout the country. Under this situation, we cherished the honor of the "Mao Zedong" even more. We thought, "The history of safe driving of the 'Mao Zedong' for more than ten years is an honor created by the hard work of our predecessors, and we must not lose it from our hands," and thus the idea of ​​being afraid of losing the honor was born. With baggage in our minds, we were hesitant in our work and no longer dared to think and act as we did before. At that time, in terms of practicing basic skills, it was necessary to practice the hard skill of stopping the train smoothly at the station in one go, but some people were afraid to practice, fearing that accidents would occur if they did not do well. When the Party organization called for the use of coal feeders, we were also afraid of losing our record of saving coal for more than ninety consecutive months, and we did not dare to use them. Due to this mentality of gains and losses, our work once stagnated. Later, we analyzed the reasons for our backwardness and realized that: putting "preservation" first, preserving for the sake of "preservation," without "breaking through" in "preservation," resulted in falling behind. This was the result of not highlighting politics and not using Mao Zedong Thought as guidance. Once our understanding was improved, we had enough enthusiasm again, breaking through "preservation" to "breakthrough," practicing basic skills, and using coal feeders. Before the start of the Third Five-Year Plan, we took the lead in testing long-distance transportation from Fengtai all the way to Shanhaiguan, extending from the original 112 kilometers to 400 kilometers, breaking the record in the history of China's railways.
    Production is constantly developing, and it is necessary to highlight politics at all times and in all matters, and constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. If the ideology is solid, the production can be solid, and the technology can also be solid.

    Editor's note: There are two ways to cherish honor and maintain honor: one is to regard honor as a "burden" and preserve it for the sake of preservation, which will inevitably lead to hesitation and stagnation, resulting in the loss of honor. The other is to regard honor as the people's encouragement and encouragement to oneself, which can better proceed from the needs of socialist revolution and socialist construction, never be complacent, never be proud, continue to move forward, and create greater revolutionary honor. The profound experience of the comrades of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew fully illustrates this truth.

    思想过硬  生产才能过硬
    工作先进了，是不是就不需要突出政治？我认为，工作先进了，更需要突出政治。只有突出政治，才能坚持正确方向，就好象火车头前一定要有照明大灯，摸黑跑车才能不出事故。
    我们“毛泽东号”机车包车组，二十年来，安全行车一百八十多万公里，年年全面完成运输任务。我们能取得这样的成绩，就是突出了政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗前进。离开了政治，就寸步难行。
    一九六四年，铁道部、铁道部政治部授予我们“坚持不断革命，永当开路先锋”的奖旗；铁道部党委还作了向全国进一步推广“毛泽东号”经验的决定。在这种形势下，我们更加珍惜“毛泽东号”的荣誉了。心想，“毛泽东号”十几年安全行车的历史，是老前辈们千辛万苦创造出来的荣誉，决不能从我们手里丢掉，由此就产生了怕丢荣誉的想法。思想上有了包袱，工作上就缩手缩脚，不再象从前那样敢想敢干了。当时在练基本功方面，需要练列车进站一次停妥的硬功夫，可是有人就是不敢练，怕弄不好出事故。党组织号召使用加煤机，我们也怕丢掉连续九十多个月节约煤炭的成绩，而不敢使用。由于这种患得患失的思想，工作曾一度停滞不前。后来，我们分析了落后的原因，才认识到：“保”字当头，为“保”而“保”，不能“保”中有闯，结果落了后。这就是没有突出政治，没有用毛泽东思想作指导的结果。认识提高了，劲头又足了，破“保”为“闯”，练了基本功，使上了加煤机。在第三个五年计划开始前，我们带头试验由丰台一直到山海关的长距离运输，从原来一百一十二公里延长到四百公里，打破了我国铁路史上的纪录。
    生产是不断发展的，必须时时、事事突出政治，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己。思想过得硬，生产才能过得硬，技术也才能过得硬。“毛泽东号”机车包车组司机长  蔡连兴
    编者注：珍惜荣誉，保持荣誉，有两种做法：一种是把荣誉当成“包袱”，为保而保，这就必然缩手缩脚，故步自封，结果会丢掉了荣誉。一种是把荣誉当成人民对自己的鞭策和鼓励，这就能更好地从社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要出发，永不自满，永不骄傲，继续前进，创造更大的革命荣誉。“毛泽东号”机车包车组同志们的深切体会，充分明了这个真理。
