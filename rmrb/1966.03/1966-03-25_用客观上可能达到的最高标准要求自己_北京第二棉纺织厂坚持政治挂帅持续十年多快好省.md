    Demanding the Highest Objectively Possible Standards of Ourselves
    —Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill Persists in Putting Politics in Command for Ten Years, Achieving More, Faster, Better, and More Economically
    Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill is a factory that attracts attention. People pay attention to this factory not only because it was designed, equipped, and built by our own country, but more importantly, because the workers of Jingmian No. 2 Mill, constantly armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have always adhered to the General Line and the revolutionary spirit of the “Four Everys”—always going all out, always aiming high, always being promoters, and always demanding of themselves the highest standards objectively possible—creating ten years of continuous, comprehensive, more, faster, better, and more economical achievements.
    From the moment it started operations, this factory has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan every year and every quarter. It broke through the original design framework, developing its product range from five varieties to forty-two, and from only producing mass-market goods to a variety of high-end products. The quality of some of its main products has consistently been at an advanced level domestically. Its production costs have been relatively low among similar enterprises nationwide, with fewer employees, and the funds it has turned over to the state in ten years could be used to build nine cotton textile mills of the same scale.
    Aiming high, or content in the middle?
    In 1955, Jingmian No. 2 Mill was officially completed. In the tall, spacious factory buildings, 100,000 spindles spun rapidly, and more than 2,000 looms operated rhythmically.
    With such good production conditions, should they enjoy a comfortable life, content with generally fulfilling their tasks? Or should they adhere to high standards, striving to make greater contributions to the country? The workers excitedly said: It's the first time we're using machines made in China! We must not lie on them and live comfortably, but redouble our efforts and make greater contributions to socialist construction!
    From the moment the factory started operations, they set high standards for themselves. During the trial run stage, they spun good yarn and wove good cloth according to the requirements of regular production. Four months after starting operations, they joined Jingmian No. 1 Mill in launching a competition with old textile factories across the country. In this way, Jingmian No. 2 Mill reached the designed level in only half a year, and in the second year, it received commendation from the Ministry of Textile Industry in the national competition within the industry.
    How to treat existing achievements? When quality and other indicators conflict, how to strive for comprehensive more, faster, better, and more economical results?
    In 1957, the cotton allocated to the factory had more impurities. Some people believed that with this kind of cotton, the product quality could not be good; to improve it, it would be necessary to increase the amount of cotton used and raise the product cost. Some cadres only focused on output and neglected quality. Some even openly said to the factory director: If you want to achieve both good quality and low cost, you're bound to lose in the evaluation.
    The workers responded well: "What does it matter if one factory loses? As long as the country doesn't lose and the people don't lose, it doesn't matter if we don't get an advanced rating." Precisely because of this spirit of serving the people, they waged a struggle against some erroneous ideas. They were not afraid of difficulties and repeatedly experimented, carrying out a series of innovations on machines from the front-end spinning to the finishing stages, so that the quality of the cloth reached the best level since the factory opened, using three kilograms less cotton per piece of yarn. Continuing to advance along this path, by 1959, Jingmian No. 2 Mill was rated as an advanced collective attending the National Congress of Heroes, entering the ranks of advanced textile enterprises nationwide, with comprehensive achievements of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    At this time, should they stick to the rules, be cautious and conservative, and maintain the red flag? Or should they dare to fight, dare to take risks, and climb new peaks? Some people believed that as long as they worked step by step, with a little extra effort, the red flag could be steadily maintained, and they could live a comfortable life in the future. The majority of workers strongly disapproved of this view. They said: Chairman Mao taught us that we should be revolutionary promoters and must not lie on the red flag and live comfortably.
    The struggle between the two ideologies erupted when the higher authorities assigned them a new task of developing high-end and diversified products.
    Jingmian No. 2 Mill was originally built according to the production requirements of "few varieties, mass-market goods." To change to diversified production would inevitably bring a series of problems: equipment and technology would have to be largely overhauled, operating techniques would have to be relearned, and management workload would increase exponentially. This could temporarily disrupt production order, reduce production efficiency, increase production costs, and even cause quality accidents. However, if this hurdle was overcome, the factory's production level could be comprehensively improved, further achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results at a new level.
    Dare they fight this hard battle?
    Those who wanted to live a comfortable life smoothly said that it was rare both at home and abroad to engage in diversified production in such a large textile factory; moreover, the production order had just become normal, and the operations were just becoming skilled. If they engaged in high-end and diversified production, the quality would certainly not be guaranteed, more people would certainly be needed, management would certainly be disrupted, and they would certainly lose in the evaluation, risking losing the red flag.
    The majority of workers opposed this "comfortable life" mentality. They said: Is it really because we are carrying the red flag that we dare not take any more risks? No! Since high-end and diversified production is what the Party and the people require of us, we should meet the difficulties head-on and make greater contributions to socialist construction. The factory Party committee supported the opinions of the majority of workers, and in 1961, resolutely undertook the task of producing a high-end export poplin.
    This kind of poplin had fine yarn count, many warp threads, high density, and high requirements, making it very difficult to produce. As soon as the loom started, a large number of broken ends and defects appeared. The number of looms tended by each weaver dropped sharply from twenty-four for old varieties to four, and they were still throwing flying shuttles and weaving defective cloth. All indicators declined sharply, and after selecting and sorting the woven poplin, the pass rate was still a "big zero."
    Continue to advance, or retreat in the face of difficulties?
    The broad masses of people answered decisively: "If you don't walk, you won't fall, but we can't stop walking because we're afraid of falling. No matter how difficult it is, we must never bow our heads in the face of difficulties."
    The revolutionary determination was put into action. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and production experts quickly formed a professional fighting team to fight hard battles in the most difficult production positions. Leading cadres and technicians also fought alongside the workers day and night. Sizing workers went out to learn from others four times, innovating processes, improving operations, and mastering the sizing rules. Weavers worked hard to hone their skills, practicing knotting movements after work. Assistants summarized their experience, improved their operations, and broke through the first barrier to improving the quality of high-end poplin. Repair workers and weavers worked closely together to improve the equipment status of the looms, reducing several continuous defects.
    Relying on the revolutionary spirit of the entire factory's workers, more than a dozen technical difficulties in producing high-end poplin were overcome one by one. The number of looms tended by each weaver increased from four to twenty-four. Later, many people even reached a new level of tending thirty-two looms. The export pass rate of poplin gradually increased to more than 95 percent, becoming an advanced product nationwide.
    Through this battle, the workers' awareness was significantly improved, and they were also trained in management, technology, and other aspects. Subsequently, they fought several more hard battles in succession, weaving a batch of new products that were even more difficult to weave, increasing the variety of yarn and cloth produced by the entire factory sevenfold compared to the design requirements. The entire factory's production achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results at a higher level.
    What to do in the face of honor?
    Having obtained the red flag and become advanced, should they divide one into two, continue the revolution, and continue to advance? Or should they regard it as a burden, become complacent, and stagnate? In the early years, Jingmian No. 2 Mill looked for shortcomings when it had achievements, and whenever complacency reared its head, it used the weapon of dividing one into two to fight against it. However, as the number of red flags received increased, and as more and more people came to visit and learn, complacency grew rapidly. That was in the first half of 1963, when three varieties were rated as high-quality and fifteen new varieties were trial-produced in succession, management relaxed, and most of the indicators stagnated, and some quickly fell behind.
    In December 1963, at a conference of the city's textile industry system, Jingmian No. 2 Mill was seriously criticized by the Textile Bureau. When the factory Party committee discussed this issue, some felt wronged, some complained, some were unconvinced, and some didn't care.
    However, the gap was obvious, and the physical quality of several varieties was not as good as that of fraternal factories. It was impossible to deny it. Why was there such a big gap? Some comrades presented a lot of objective reasons, such as "there are too many varieties, and quality is difficult to manage," "the quality of raw cotton is unstable, affecting quality," and "there are fewer employees, and the technical strength is not as good as that of fraternal factories," and so on. In short, they did not deserve to be criticized.
    At this time, many people presented a lot of facts, saying: If there were no complacency, why have such discussions become more and more frequent recently: "Our factory is big, and we have the most varieties. It's not easy to have such achievements!" "Don't look at the fact that our indicators are worse than theirs. Compare comprehensively, and we're still better than them!" If there were no complacency, why is the enthusiasm for learning from advanced experiences not as good as before? When going to fraternal factories, they no longer act like primary school students, putting on airs as advanced people, looking at others' shortcomings more and looking at others' strengths less; even when they see others' strengths, they say, "They have fewer varieties, so it's naturally easier to do well." In 1963, the factory sent people to Shanghai to study three times, but after they came back, the Party committee didn't listen to the reports seriously. When some comrades heard that fraternal factories were better than them in some aspects, they repeatedly asked, "Did you see it? Is it real or fake?"
    These facts shook people and also sobered them up. The sense of being wronged and the complaints disappeared, and those who were unconvinced and those who didn't care also felt that they were wrong. They said: "Yes, we always think we're good enough, forgetting the 'Four Everys.' We have become complacent, causing our production to stagnate in the past six months." After ideological struggle and learning, the comrades of the Party committee re-examined their leadership ideology and leadership methods, and made a self-criticism to all cadres and workers in the factory, asking everyone to give opinions to the leadership. The workers had been holding back a lot of opinions for a long time. They said: "It should have been criticized long ago. The leadership just wants to lie on the red flag and not move." "When comrades from fraternal factories come to learn, they just talk and talk to people, rarely humbly asking for advice. We couldn't stand it long ago!" "These days, the leadership just likes to listen to reports upstairs. When they hear about achievements, they smile broadly; when they hear about problems, they frown. Isn't this complacency?"
    The workers' sharp criticism further sounded the alarm for the factory's leading cadres. They thought: "It's not terrible to make mistakes, but it's terrible not to correct them. Whether we correct them or not depends on our actions!" They went to the front line separately and worked with the workers. More than a month later, they collected the opinions of all the factory's workers and formulated a plan to catch up with the most advanced level in the country. Then, the entire factory quickly launched a mass movement to compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass.
    This struggle against complacency has achieved great results. However, have the roots of complacency been dug out of their minds? No! The comrades of Jingmian No. 2 Mill said: It is indeed not easy to understand a thing. In 1964, the factory Party committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on opposing complacency and made a further examination of complacency. In 1965, at an industrial conference in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee presented three ideologies regarding catching up with the world's advanced level: Are you a proletarian revolutionary? Are you a bourgeois revolutionary? Or are you a feudal royalist? Whose banner should you raise? Whose student should you be? Targeting these three ideologies, the conference launched a major discussion, studying Chairman Mao's instruction that humanity must constantly sum up experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress. After this discussion, the comrades of Jingmian No. 2 Mill made a further liquidation of complacency. They said that for a long time, we have looked at achievements more and at shortcomings less, and we only want to hear praise and don't want to hear criticism. This is a matter of worldview. Without establishing the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, the problem of having no great ambitions and being easily satisfied cannot be fundamentally cured. They said that they were determined to be proletarian revolutionaries and establish the lofty ambition of catching up with the world's advanced level.
    The leading comrades of Jingmian No. 2 Mill liquidated their erroneous thoughts, and their eyes no longer lingered on their existing achievements, but focused on the gap with the international advanced level. Soon, they broke through the backward state of manual operation of cotton feeding that had existed in China's textile factories since they had been established. With the help of the Textile Research Institute and the Municipal Textile Research Institute, they trial-produced the first automatic cotton feeding and blending machine, which had been tested and experimented with for seven years, increasing the production efficiency of cotton feeding workers by more than one time; they also tested or promoted new technologies and projects such as molybdenum disulfide, high-speed carding, nylon spindle tape, continuous needle-copying, and simple large drafting devices. Now, the technical revolution movement in the entire factory is developing vigorously. They are determined to realize the technical transformation of the entire factory and climb a new peak of more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Highlighting politics, or highlighting systems?
    In the process of continuously revolutionizing and continuously developing production, Jingmian No. 2 Mill gradually found a good form for carrying out mass movements in textile enterprises—the "Three Sisters."
    The "Three Sisters" are the early, middle, and night shift workers on the same machine and with the same variety, who, under the guidance of communist thought, twist the three shifts of production into one rope, learning from each other, helping each other, catching up with each other, and surpassing each other, advancing together. In this way, the mass movement in the entire factory is advanced from praising one person and one thing to a new stage of communist cooperation.
    This factory has always paid attention to grasping typical examples and establishing pacesetters, launching mass movements to learn from and catch up with advanced experiences, targeting problems that arise in production. However, in order to run a socialist enterprise well, should they highlight politics, the first factor of people, or highlight systems, relying on systems to manage people? This issue has not been resolved among some people. In particular, when encountering difficulties in production, some people waver.
    "Stop engaging in mass movements. If we keep messing around, we'll be in chaos."
    "We can't even manage the dead (systems), so how can we manage the living (people)?"
    They have a strong desire to do a good job in production. However, they do not believe in people. In their view, as long as people are managed by systems, the enterprise can be managed well.
    However, the "Three Sisters" stood up from the mass movement and issued a sharp challenge to them.
    Advanced producer Chen Suzhi, after participating in the National Congress of Heroes in 1959, developed communist thought, with the wish that "one flower does not make spring, but a hundred flowers blooming makes spring," and, under the leadership and help of the Party, organized the first "Three Sisters" with Yu Shiqing and Wang Fengxiao, who worked on the same machine. They not only did a good job in their own shift's production, but also worked together to do a good job in the production of all three shifts. They helped each other in political ideology, learned from each other in production technology, and cared for each other in life, turning three hearts into one heart, wholeheartedly for the revolution. These three young female workers have led the way in increasing the number of looms tended six times, and their output and quality have always maintained an advanced level within the factory.
    The "Three Sisters" are not only an advanced political and ideological collective, but also an advanced labor collective. With a brand-new production relationship, they launched a tit-for-tat struggle against those unreasonable systems.
    When one shift produced defective cloth, someone used the system of distributing it among the three shifts to manage people; the "Three Sisters" used a high degree of communist cooperation style to create conditions for each other and give play to the role of each shift.
    Some people overemphasized the reward system. Whoever found a defect or missed a defect was managed by giving more or less bonuses; the "Three Sisters" would rather sacrifice excess bonuses and voluntarily go to new product machines with low efficiency to tend the looms.
    Some people simply used scores to assess production, deducting points for being late to work or for not implementing the operating procedures well, wanting to solve problems with a point-deduction system; the "Three Sisters" highly developed their revolutionary consciousness, strictly adhered to their posts, and achieved four same things—operating the same whether someone was inspecting or not, operating the same whether the work was difficult or easy, operating the same in the eighth hour and the first hour, and operating the same in the night shift and the day shift.
    New things are often not recognized by people all at once.
    Some people always feel that using systems to control people is simple and easy, as if the matter is finished once they issue an indicator and conduct an inspection. They do not understand that reasonable systems can only play a role when they are implemented by conscious people, and they do not believe that highlighting politics can solve problems in production.
    The factory Party committee supports the "Three Sisters," but it did not fully recognize the revolutionary significance and pioneering spirit of the "Three Sisters" at the beginning. For a considerable period of time, the "Three Sisters" movement was not promoted throughout the factory.
    In early 1964, the revolutionary spirit of Daqing shook the entire factory like a spring thunder.
    "Why is Wang Tie of Daqing so inspiring?" With this question in mind, the factory Party committee used Daqing as a mirror to examine itself. They found that in the past, the advanced models established by the factory focused more on introducing production achievements and less on highlighting advanced ideas, starting more from solving specific current problems and less from fundamentally solving the ideological revolutionization of people. Why? In the final analysis, it was because they did not highlight politics and did not put the factor of people first. They re-summarized the experience of the "Three Sisters," prominently publicizing the communist thought of the "Three Sisters" in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, turning three hearts into one heart, and wholeheartedly for the revolution. At the same time, they widely organized workers to study Chairman Mao's works, educating everyone with the revolutionary spirit of Zhang Side and Bethune; organizing old workers to tell about the blood and tears of hired laborers in the old society, improving people's class consciousness. Many people were inspired with strong revolutionary feelings and expressed that they wanted to learn from the "Three Sisters" and spin yarn and weave cloth for the revolution. More than 1,600 people successively formed more than 500 "Three Sisters," and many workers who were not in three-shift production learned from the "Three Sisters" and followed the example of the "Three Sisters."
    Through the "Three Sisters" movement, the workers are catching up with and surpassing each other, wave after wave. Now, more than 150 "Three Sisters" in the entire factory have caught up with or are close to the production level of the old "Three Sisters." The number of advanced producers is snowballing, growing from more than 80 in 1963 to more than 200 in 1965.
    The "Three Sisters" movement takes "one-ization"—ideological revolutionization—as its core, and implements it in "three-excellence"—excellent operation, excellent equipment, and excellent technology, tightly combining vigorously carrying out mass movements with strengthening centralized management, giving play to the enormous creativity of the workers and masses. Under their leadership, the atmosphere of vigorously practicing basic operating skills in the entire factory is unprecedentedly strong, the equipment status is unprecedentedly good, the job responsibility system is implemented unprecedentedly well, and process management has been significantly improved. In the past two years, more than 350 operating masters and operating experts have emerged in the entire factory, and 84 percent of the machines have been rated as red flag machines. The average number of looms tended by weaving workers has increased by about 30 percent, and the first-class pass rate of the main products has remained above 90 percent.
    Highlighting politics, the factor of people first, or highlighting systems and relying on systems to manage people, this struggle is essentially a class struggle, a struggle between two lines of running socialist enterprises and running capitalist enterprises. This struggle has not ended yet, but in the face of facts, especially after the socialist education movement, people's class consciousness has greatly improved, and some people who were originally skeptical and uninterested in mass movements also admit that the "Three Sisters" movement is a good form for the factory to rely on the working masses to run socialist enterprises well. They said: The idea of ​​believing in systems and not believing in people is wrong. To run a socialist enterprise well, the most important thing is to highlight politics, the factor of people first.
    Where should the roots be planted?
    The fact that Jingmian No. 2 Mill has been able to insist on demanding the highest objectively possible standards of itself and achieve ten years of continuous more, faster, better, and more economical results also lies in the fact that all work is rooted in the grassroots, and the grassroots rely on a group of combat fortresses that are relatively good at contacting the masses—Party branches led by non-detached branch secretaries.
    Look at the role played by these non-detached branch secretaries!
    In the fine spinning workshop, there was an apprentice named Hao Lianhu who was unwilling to be an auxiliary worker and did not work hard. The branch secretary Chen Zhi worked with him, talked about the suffering he had endured in the old society when he was a child, talked about his experience in studying "Serving the People," and also asked the members of the Communist Youth League branch to study Chairman Mao's works with him. Gradually, Hao Lianhu understood the significance of being an auxiliary worker. With the help of his comrades, this middle school student who entered the factory in 1964 has recently become a probationary member of the Communist Party. Chen Zhi is an old doffing worker. She works with the workers, studies Chairman Mao's works together, and lives in the same dormitory, and is called a "close friend" by the people.
    Last October, the factory renovated the three-roller equipment and corduroy equipment in the opening and cleaning workshop, requiring a total of more than 1,600 parts to be rushed. Many people in the repair workshop felt that the work was heavy, the time was tight, and it was difficult to complete. The Party branch secretary, carpenter Liu Xin, repeatedly conducted political mobilization among the masses, set an example, came to the fitter group with the most arduous task, and fought side by side with the workers. He scrambled to do heavy and dirty work, moved iron, drilled holes, and also led the workers to improve tools, boosting the confidence and enthusiasm of everyone, and completed the task six and five days ahead of schedule respectively. Liu Xin, this old Communist Party member who participated in the revolution in 1939, has always worked with the workers as an ordinary worker. The workers said that he is a diligent and conscientious "leader."
    Jingmian No. 2 Mill has a total of 32 production unit Party branches, of which 28 branches gradually implemented the non-detachment of branch secretaries shortly after the factory was put into operation. Among these branch secretaries, many of them have been advanced producers for several consecutive years. Like the 180 workers in their own section, they have production tasks when they go to work, and they have meetings, studies, and the same household chores at home after work. Their work is quite outstanding. Many Party members and workers praised them in unison, saying that they are better than the detached branch secretaries.
    They said that the non-detachment of Party branch secretaries has six major benefits:
    First, they eat, live, work, and study Chairman Mao's works with the workers. They are on the front line of production every day and can grasp a large number of active thoughts and active situations in a timely manner, and solve problems relatively quickly.
    Second, collective leadership is good. The non-detached branch committee members said: In the early days, when the branch secretary was detached, he was responsible for everything anyway. Now that everyone is not detached, everyone shares the heavy burden, and collective leadership is strengthened.
    Third, the connection with the masses is good. The secretary and branch committee members are workers and have common ideological feelings with the workers. They often visit workers' families, care for and take care of the workers, and pay attention to holding short meetings and speaking briefly, becoming close friends of the workers.
    Fourth, the democratic style is good. The workers said: The secretary and branch committee members are working by our side. We can see and see their words and deeds clearly, and dare to give opinions and criticize them.
    Fifth, they lead all branch committee members, Party members, and activists to do political and ideological work, forming a mass political and ideological work network.
    Sixth, they are able to do both literary and military work, are both branch secretaries and ordinary workers; both politically advanced elements and production experts or labor models. They endure hardship first and set an example. The workers are convinced, and the work is easy to do.
    After the socialist education movement last year, the general election of the various branch committees was held, and the vast majority of the non-detached branch secretaries continued to be elected. The general comment of the masses of workers on them is: We can trust such cadres. With them leading us, we will definitely be able to reach communism.
    Recently, in order to welcome the Third Five-Year Plan, the Jingmian No. 2 Mill Party Committee convened a Party Congress, using the weapon of dividing one into two, summing up experience, finding great gaps, and putting forward new goals of catching up with the advanced levels at home and abroad. All the workers in the factory are in high spirits and are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the General Line, and use the revolutionary spirit of the "Four Everys" to overfulfill the Third Five-Year Plan.

    用客观上可能达到的最高标准要求自己
    ——北京第二棉纺织厂坚持政治挂帅持续十年多快好省
    北京第二棉纺织厂是一个引人注视的工厂。人们注视这个工厂，不仅因为它是我国自行设计、自造设备、自己建造的，更重要的是，用毛泽东思想不断武装起来的京棉二厂职工，始终坚持总路线，坚持永远鼓足干劲、永远力争上游、永远当促进派、永远以客观上可能达到的最高标准要求自己的“四个永远”的革命精神，创造了持续十年全面多快好省的成绩。
    这个工厂一开工就年年、季季全面超额完成国家计划。它冲破原设计的框框，产品品种由五种发展到四十二种，由只能生产大路货发展为多种高档产品。它的一些主要产品的质量，一直居于国内先进水平。它的生产成本在全国同类型企业中一直比较低，用人比较少，十年向国家上缴的资金，可以用来建设九个同等规模的棉纺织厂。是力争上游，还是安居中游？
    一九五五年，京棉二厂正式建成了。在高大宽敞的厂房里，十万纱锭飞快地旋转着，两千多台布机有节奏地开动着。
    生产条件这么好。是养尊处优，满足于一般地完成任务？还是坚持高标准，力争为国家作出更多的贡献？工人们激动地说：头一回使上咱中国造的机器，决不能躺在它上边吃舒心饭，一定要加倍努力，在社会主义建设中做出更大的贡献！
    他们从工厂一开工，就给自己提出了高标准。在试车阶段，就按正规生产的要求，纺出好纱，织出好布。开工后四个月，又同京棉一厂一起，向全国老纺织厂展开竞赛。就这样，京棉二厂只用半年时间，就达到设计水平，第二年，在全国同行业竞赛中，获得纺织工业部表扬。
    怎样对待已有的成绩？当质量和其他指标发生矛盾的时候，怎样力求做到全面多快好省？
    一九五七年，调给这个厂的部分原棉杂质多了。有人认为，用这种原棉，产品质量好不了；要好，就必须增加用棉量，提高产品成本。有的干部只抓产量不顾质量。甚至有人公开地对厂长说：你这样好省两头都要占，评比非吃亏不可。
    职工们回答得好：“一个厂吃亏算什么，只要国家不吃亏，人民不吃亏，我们评不上先进没有关系。”正是有了这种为人民服务的思想，他们同一些错误思想进行了斗争。他们不怕困难，反复试验，从前纺到整理等机器上进行了一系列革新，使布的质量达到开工以来的最好水平，每件纱少用三公斤棉花。沿着这条道路不断前进，到一九五九年，京棉二厂就以全面实现多快好省的成绩，被评为出席全国群英大会的先进集体，进入全国纺织企业的先进行列。
    这个时候，是墨守陈规，谨小慎微，保住红旗？还是敢拼敢闯，敢冒风险，攀登新的高峰？有的人认为，只要按部就班地干下去，稍许加点劲儿，红旗就稳能继续拿到手，今后可以过舒心日子了。对这种意见，大多数职工一百个不赞成。他们说：毛主席教导我们，要当革命的促进派，决不能躺在红旗上吃舒心饭。
    两种思想的斗争，在上级交给他们向高档多品种生产发展的新的任务面前爆发了。
    京棉二厂原是按照“少品种、大路货”的生产要求建设的。要改成多品种生产，势必带来一系列的难题：设备、工艺要大部翻改，操作技术要重新学，管理工作量要成倍增加。这就可能暂时打乱生产秩序，降低生产效率，增大生产成本，甚至可能造成质量事故。可是，如果闯过这一关，工厂的生产水平就能全面提高，在新的水平上进一步实现多快好省。
    敢不敢打这场硬仗？
    想平平稳稳过舒心日子的人说，在这么大一个纺织厂里搞多品种生产，国内外少有；再说，现在生产秩序刚正常，操作刚熟练，要是搞高档多品种生产，质量一定保不住，用人一定要多，管理一定要打乱，评比一定要吃亏，就有丢掉红旗的风险。
    大多数职工反对这种“吃舒心饭”的思想。他们说：难道真的因为扛上了红旗，就不敢再冒风险了？不能！既然高档多品种生产是党和人民对我们的要求，我们就应当迎着困难上，给社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。工厂党委支持大多数职工群众的意见，一九六一年，毅然承担了生产一种出口高档府绸的任务。
    这种府绸纱支细，经纱多，密度大，要求高，很不好做。织布机一开动，就出现了大批断头和疵点。挡车工看台数由老品种时的二十四台急降到四台，还是打飞梭、织坏布。各项指标直线下降，织成的府绸，挑来选去，合格率还是个“大鸭蛋”。
    继续前进，还是在困难面前退却？
    广大群众斩钉截铁地回答：“不走道不摔跤，可我们不能因为怕摔跤就不走道。千难万难也决不能在困难面前低头。”
    革命的决心落实在行动上。共产党员、共青团员和生产能手们迅速组成了一支专业战斗队，到最困难的生产岗位去打硬仗。领导干部和技术人员也日夜和工人并肩作战。浆纱工四次外出取经，革新工艺，改进操作，掌握了上浆规律。挡车工苦练硬功夫，下了班还练结头动作。帮接工总结了经验，改进了操作，闯开了提高高档府绸质量第一关。修机工和挡车工紧密协作，改善了布机的设备状态，减少了几种连续性疵点。
    靠着全厂职工这股子革命干劲，生产高档府绸的十多道技术难关一道一道被突破。挡车工的看台数由四台提高到二十四台。后来，许多人还达到看三十二台的新水平。府绸的出口合格率逐步提高到百分之九十五以上，成为全国的先进产品。
    通过这一场战斗，职工们的觉悟显著提高，在管理、技术等方面也受到了锻炼。随后，他们又连续打了几场硬仗，织成一批更难织的新产品，使全厂纱和布的品种比设计要求增加了七倍。整个工厂的生产在更高的水平上实现了多快好省。在荣誉面前怎么办？
    拿到红旗，当上先进，是一分为二，不断革命，继续前进呢？还是把它当成包袱，骄傲自满，停滞不前？最初几年，京棉二厂有了成绩找差距，骄傲自满一冒头，就用一分为二的武器同它斗。但是，当得到的红旗越来越多的时候，当前来参观、学习的人越来越多的时候，骄傲自满迅速滋长起来了。那是在一九六三年上半年，当三个品种被评为优质和一连试制成十五个新品种的时候，管理放松了，各项指标大都在原地踏步，有的很快就落后了。
    一九六三年十二月，在一次全市纺织工业系统的大会上，京棉二厂受到纺织局的严肃批评。工厂党委会在讨论这个问题的时候，有委屈的，有埋怨的，有不服气的，也有不在乎的。
    可是，差距明摆着，几个品种的实物质量不如兄弟厂，不承认也不行。为什么有那么多差距？有些同志摆了一大堆客观原因，什么“品种多，质量不好管”啦，“原棉质量不稳定，影响质量”啦，“用人少，技术力量不如兄弟厂”啦，等等。总之一句话，不该受批评。
    这时，不少人摆出了很多的事实说：如果没有骄傲自满，为什么近来这样的议论越来越多：“我们厂子大，品种可就数我们多，能有这样的成绩，不容易！”“你不要看咱们这个指标比他差，全面比一比，还不如我们嘛！”如果没有骄傲自满，为什么学先进的劲头不如从前？到兄弟厂去，小学生不当了，先进的架子摆出来了，看人家的短处多，看人家的长处少；就是看到人家的长处，也是“他们的品种少，当然容易搞得好啦。”一九六三年厂里三次派人去上海学习，可是回来后党委没有认真听听汇报。有的同志听到兄弟厂那个方面比自己好，也是一再追问：“你看见了吗？是真的还是假的？”
    这些事实，使人震动，也使人清醒。委屈埋怨消除了，不服气的、不在乎的，也觉得自己不对了。他们说：“是的，我们老想着差不多，忘记了‘四个永远’。我们是骄傲自满了，使我们这半年来的生产停滞。”党委的同志们经过思想斗争，经过学习，重新检查了领导思想和领导方法，并且向全体干部和全厂职工作检讨，要求大家给领导提意见。工人们早就憋着一肚子意见，他们说：“早该批评了，领导上就是想躺在红旗上不动了。”“兄弟厂的同志来学习，就是呱啦呱啦给人讲，很少向人家虚心请教，我们早就看不上眼了！”“领导上这些日子就爱在楼上听汇报，听到成绩，眉开眼笑，听到问题，眉头一皱，这不是骄傲了吗？”
    工人同志们的尖锐批评，进一步给工厂领导干部敲响警钟。他们想：“不怕犯错误，就怕不改错，改不改，看行动吧！”他们分头蹲到第一线，和工人一起干了起来。一个多月以后，集中了全厂职工的意见，制订出了一个赶超国内最先进水平的规划，接着，全厂迅速掀起了比学赶帮超的群众运动。
    这场反对骄傲自满的斗争，收到很大成效。但是，骄傲自满的根子是不是从他们的思想上挖出来了？没有！京棉二厂的同志们说：认识一个事物，的确是不容易的。一九六四年，工厂党委反复学习了毛主席有关反对骄傲自满的指示，对骄傲自满作了进一步的检查。一九六五年，中共北京市委在一次工业会议上，摆出了对待赶超世界先进水平的三种思想：是无产阶级革命家？是资产阶级革命家？还是封建的保皇党人？树谁的旗帜？当谁的学生？针对三种思想，学习毛主席的人类总得不断总结经验，有所发现、有所发明、有所创造、有所前进的指示，会上展开了一场大讨论。京棉二厂的同志经过这场讨论，对骄傲自满作了进一步的清算。他们说，我们长期以来，看成绩多，看缺点少，只愿意听表扬，不愿意听批评。这是世界观问题。不树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观，胸无大志、器小易盈的毛病，就根治不了。他们表示，决心当无产阶级革命家，树立赶超世界先进水平的雄心壮志。
    京棉二厂的领导同志们清算了错误思想，他们的目光不再留恋在已有的成绩上，而是注视在同国际先进水平的差距上。不久，他们突破我国从有纺织厂以来都是用手工操作的喂棉落后状态，在纺织研究院和市纺织研究所的帮助下，试制成坚持试验了七年的第一台自动喂棉混棉机，把喂棉工人的生产效率提高一倍以上；还试验或者推广了二硫化钼、高速梳棉、尼龙锭带、连续抄针和简易大牵伸装置等新技术项目。现在，全厂的技术革命运动正蓬勃开展。他们决心实现全厂的技术改造，攀登新的多快好省的高峰。突出政治，还是突出制度？
    在不断革命、不断发展生产过程中，京棉二厂逐步找到了在纺织企业大搞群众运动的一种好形式——“三姐妹”。
      “三姐妹”，是同机器、同品种的早、中、夜三班工人，在共产主义思想指导下，把三班生产拧成一股绳，互学互帮，互赶互超，共同前进。这样，就把全厂的群众运动从表扬一人一事，推进到一个共产主义大协作的新阶段。
    这个工厂一直注意抓典型，树标兵，针对生产中出现的问题，开展学先进、赶先进的群众运动。但是，办好社会主义企业，是突出政治、人的因素第一，还是突出制度、靠制度管人？这个问题，在一部分人中间并没有解决。特别是生产上遇到难题的时候，有些人就动摇起来。
      “别再搞群众运动了，再瞎折腾，非乱套不行。”
      “死的（制度）还管不过来呢，还管活（人）的？”
    他们有搞好生产的强烈愿望。但是，他们不相信人，在他们看来，只要用制度把人管起来，企业就可以管好了。
    可是，“三姐妹”从群众运动中站了出来，向他们提出尖锐的挑战。
    先进生产者陈素芝，在一九五九年参加全国群英会后，发扬共产主义思想，怀着“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”的心愿，在党的领导和帮助下，和同机台的另外两班工人于世卿、王凤霄组织了第一串“三姐妹”。她们不仅把本班生产搞好，还同心协力把三班生产搞好。她们在政治思想上互相帮助，生产技术上互相学习，生活上互相关心，三条心变成一条心，一心为革命。这三个青年女工，曾六次带头增加看台数量，产量质量一直保持厂内先进水平。
    “三姐妹”既是先进的政治思想集体，又是先进的劳动集体。她们以崭新的生产关系，向那些不合理的制度展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    一个班出了次布，有人用三班分摊的制度治人；“三姐妹”用高度的共产主义协作风格，互创条件，发挥每一班的作用。
    有人把奖励制度强调过了头，谁检到一个疵点，谁漏掉一个疵点，都用多给或少给奖金来治人；“三姐妹”宁可牺牲超额奖，主动到效率低的新产品机台上去挡车。
    有人简单地用分数来考核生产，上班迟到，扣分，操作法执行得不好，扣分，想用扣分制度解决问题；“三姐妹”高度发挥革命自觉性，严守岗位，做到四个一样——有人检查和无人检查时操作一样，活难做和活好做时操作一样，第八小时和第一小时操作一样，夜班和白班操作一样。
    新生事物往往不是一下子被人们承认的。
    有些人总觉得凭制度卡人，简单省事，似乎一下指标，一检查，事情就办完了。他们不懂得合理的制度只有靠觉悟的人去执行，才能发挥作用，他们不相信突出政治可以解决生产上的问题。
    工厂党委是支持“三姐妹”的，但是对“三姐妹”的革命意义和首创精神，开始也不完全认识。相当长的时期内，“三姐妹”运动并没有在全厂推广。
    一九六四年初，大庆革命精神象一声春雷，震动着全厂。
      “大庆的王铁人为什么这样振奋人心？”工厂党委带着这个问题，用大庆这面镜子照了自己。他们发现，过去本厂树立的先进典型，介绍生产成绩多，突出先进思想少，从解决当前具体问题出发多，从根本上解决人的思想革命化比较少。为什么？归根到底，还是因为没有突出政治，没有把人的因素放在第一位。他们重新总结了“三姐妹”的经验，突出地宣传了“三姐妹”活学活用毛主席著作、三条心变一条心、一心为革命的共产主义思想。同时，广泛组织职工学习毛主席著作，用张思德、白求恩的革命精神教育大家；组织老工人诉说旧社会包身工的血泪仇，提高人们的阶级觉悟。许多人激发起强烈的革命感情，纷纷表示要学习“三姐妹”，为革命纺纱织布。有一千六百多人先后组成了五百多串“三姐妹”，还有不少非三班生产的职工向“三姐妹”学习，向“三姐妹”看齐。
    通过“三姐妹”运动，工人们你赶我超，一浪接一浪。现在全厂已有一百五十多串“三姐妹”赶上或接近老“三姐妹”的生产水平。先进生产者象滚雪球似的，越滚越大，从一九六三年的八十多人滚到一九六五年的二百多人。
    “三姐妹”运动以“一化”——思想革命化为核心，落实到“三过硬”——操作过硬，设备过硬、工艺过硬，把大搞群众运动和加强集中管理紧紧地结合起来，发挥了职工群众的巨大创造力。在他们带动下，全厂大练操作基本功的风气空前浓，设备状态空前好，岗位责任制执行得空前好，工艺管理有了显著改进。最近两年，全厂就涌现出三百五十多名操作健将和操作能手，百分之八十四的机台被评为红旗机台。织布挡车工的平均看台水平提高了百分之三十左右，主要产品的下机一等品率保持在百分之九十以上。
    突出政治，人的因素第一，还是突出制度、依靠制度管人，这场斗争，实质上是一场阶级斗争，是办社会主义企业还是办资本主义企业两条路线的斗争。这场斗争，现在还没有结束，但是在事实面前，特别是经过社会主义教育运动，人们的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，一些原来对群众运动半信半疑，不感兴趣的人，也承认“三姐妹”运动是工厂依靠工人群众办好社会主义企业的一种好形式。他们说：迷信制度不信人的思想错了。要办好社会主义企业，最重要的还是突出政治，人的因素第一。根子要扎在哪里？
    京棉二厂能够坚持用客观上可能达到的最高标准要求自己，取得持续十年多快好省的成就，还在于一切工作扎根于基层，而基层靠的是一批联系群众比较好的战斗堡垒——不脱产的支部书记领导的党支部。
    看看这些不脱产的支部书记所起的作用吧！
    细纱车间有个叫郝连护的徒工，不愿当辅助工，干活不起劲，支部书记陈志跟他一起干活，说自己小时候在旧社会受的苦，讲自己学《为人民服务》的体会，还让团支部委员跟他一块儿学习毛主席著作。慢慢地，郝连护懂得了干辅助工的意义。经过同志们的帮助，这个一九六四年进厂的中学生，最近已经成为中共预备党员。陈志是位老落纱工。她同工人们一块儿干活，同学毛主席著作，同住一个宿舍，被人们称作“贴心人”。
    去年十月，这个厂改造清花车间三滚筒设备和灯芯绒设备，共需要赶制一千六百多个零件。机修车间不少人觉得活儿重，时间紧，完成有困难。党支部书记、木工刘新反复向群众进行政治动员，以身作则，来到任务最繁重的钳工组，和工人并肩奋战。他抢着干重活干脏活，搬铁、打眼，还带动工人改进工具，鼓舞了大伙的信心和干劲，分别提前六天和五天完成了任务。刘新，这个一九三九年就参加革命的老共产党员，始终以普通劳动者的身份，和工人一块儿干活，工人们说他是勤勤恳恳的“带头人”。
    京棉二厂共有三十二个生产单位党支部，其中二十八个支部从工厂投产后不久，就逐步实行支部书记不脱产。这些支部书记中间，不少人是连续几年的先进生产者。他们跟本工段的百八十个工人一样，上班有生产任务，下了班要开会、学习、家里同样有一摊家务事。他们的工作却做得相当出色。许多党员和工人异口同声地称赞他们比脱产的支部书记还棒。
    他们说党支部书记不脱产有六大好处：
    一、和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，同学习毛主席著作。他们天天在生产第一线，能及时地掌握大量活思想，活情况，解决问题比较及时。
    二、集体领导好。不脱产的支部委员说：早先支部书记脱产，反正工作有他顶，有他包。现在大家不脱产，千斤重担众人挑，集体领导加强了。
    三、联系群众好。书记、支委是工人，和工人有共同的思想感情。他们经常访问工人家庭，关心工人，体贴工人，注意开短会，说短话，成了工人的贴心人。
    四、民主作风好。工人说：书记和支委就在身边劳动，他们的一言一行，我们看得见，看得清，敢提意见敢批评。
    五、他们带动全体支委、党员和积极分子做政治思想工作，形成群众性的政治思想工作网。
    六、他们能文能武，既是支部书记，又是普通劳动者；既是政治上的先进分子，又是生产能手或劳动模范。他们吃苦在先，以身作则，工人信服，工作好做。
    去年社会主义教育运动后，各支部委员会普遍改选，不脱产的支部书记绝大部分继续当选。工人群众对他们的总评论是：这样的干部，我们信得过，有他们领导我们，一定能走到共产主义。
    最近，为了迎接第三个五年计划，京棉二厂党委召开了党代表大会，用一分为二的武器，总结经验，大找差距，提出了赶超国内外先进水平的新目标。全厂职工斗志昂扬，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举总路线红旗，以“四个永远”的革命精神，超额完成第三个五年计划。
