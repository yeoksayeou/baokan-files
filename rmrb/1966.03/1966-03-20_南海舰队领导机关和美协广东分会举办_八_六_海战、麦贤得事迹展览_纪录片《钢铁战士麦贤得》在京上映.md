The second part introduces the course of Steel Warrior Mai Xiande, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, from an ordinary fisherman's son to a rapid growth into a proletarian fighting hero. Among them, there are four diaries written by Mai Xiande after joining the army, his family history, and his letter of determination to participate in aiding Vietnam and resisting America; there is his handwriting "Long Live Chairman Mao" written with his left hand in the hospital; and there is also the loose screw that he found among thousands of screws when he was seriously injured, as well as the wrench he used to tighten the screw.
