    Being a Counselor is Doing Revolution
    Ping Shuhua, Counselor of the Yongding Road Television Class, Taiyuan Television Work-Study Middle School
    Education is Revolutionary Work
    I am the counselor of the Yongding Road Television Class of Taiyuan Television Work-Study Middle School. When the school first started, some parents couldn't figure out what a television school was for; the students weren't interested in it either. Some came to watch "little movies." Because the students' learning objectives were unclear, and some students had poor ideological character and academic foundation, the class was quite disorderly. In class, some read novels, some sang, some slept, and some even fought, cursed, and heckled. Being able to do homework was considered good; some didn't even bring notebooks. I felt this work was really hard to do.
    At this time, the school called on us to study Chairman Mao's works. With everyone's help, I studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao taught us: "At times of difficulty, we must see our achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." I thought, the Party has nurtured me for more than a decade, if I leave now, I'd be a deserter. The school leaders and comrades also encouraged me to keep going. They said, "Educational work is also revolutionary work." With the education and encouragement of the organization, I finally settled down.
    I began to understand the students' situations. Most of the students in the class were children of the laboring people, many were children of dual-income families. Some parents were busy with work and lacked education for their children; some children were influenced by bad habits. These parents said: "We spend more time in the factory, and the time we meet with our children is even less than you, this child is entrusted to you." What earnest trust! I felt the responsibility on my shoulders was great. I began to realize that education itself is a tool of class struggle, and being a counselor is doing revolution. Thinking of this, my mind suddenly cleared, my spirits were lifted, and I was willing to do this work.
        Acting According to Chairman Mao's Instructions
    My own ideological problem was solved, but the class was still noisy, what to do? At first, I used rigid rules, but it was like "pressing down the gourd and the ladle floats up," it couldn't solve the problem. I studied articles such as "Oppose Book Worship" and "On Practice" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "You can't solve that problem? Then go and investigate the current state of that problem and its history! When you fully understand the investigation, you will have a solution to that problem." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I started in-depth investigation. Through investigation, I found that students did not pay attention in class, not entirely because they wanted to make trouble. Some had a poor foundation and couldn't understand the lectures, so they weren't interested. Some thought that television schools were no match for ordinary middle schools, and there were fewer courses, so they couldn't learn anything. Some felt that school life was boring and monotonous, except for listening to lectures, labor, and self-study, there were no recreational activities.
    In response to these problems, I patiently persuaded and educated them on the one hand, and gave them some help on specific issues on the other. For students with a poor foundation, I strengthened tutoring and helped them make up for their lessons. I also gave the students the exam questions from ordinary middle schools to try, some of them could do it, eliminating their idea that they couldn't learn knowledge in television schools. I also invited parents to visit and attend classes, some parents saw that the TV picture was clear and the teacher's voice was loud, also eliminating the idea that television could not be used for teaching. At the same time, I invited elementary school physical education and music teachers to teach part-time, enriching the content of extracurricular activities, so that the students' legitimate demands were met.
    Then, I investigated their original elementary schools and their parents and neighbors, gradually getting a clear picture of the students in the class. At first, I helped my classmates with good intentions, but they ignored me, even argued with me, and didn't realize that the teacher cared about them at all. At this time, I asked Chairman Mao's works for advice again, studied "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods," and realized that to educate students well, in addition to strengthening ideological and political education, I should also care about them in life. For example, I learned that Li Genyuan's mother died when he was in the first grade of elementary school, and his father was an old worker, there was no one to take care of him at home, he had to cook for himself, and he was often late. Therefore, I took the initiative to help him solve some difficulties, and also told him how to make good use of time to cook. Since then, he realized that the teacher was sincerely helping him, the relationship between teacher and student improved, and he improved day by day. I also care about all the students in the class, set an example in life and labor, and the relationship with the students has improved day by day.
            Vigorously Grasp Class Education
    The students are young, and it is not easy for them to accept abstract principles. Therefore, I used vivid examples for class education.
    First, organize students to visit the families of working people and write family histories. Through this activity, inspire students from working people's families to talk about their family histories, so that they can recognize the suffering of the past. Second, I also organized students to visit class education exhibitions and invite "three olds" (old Red Army soldiers, old party members, old workers) to give reports. By talking about family history and telling revolutionary stories, inspire students to cherish today's happy life.
    In May 1965, combined with the education of "Everyone is a soldier," the class organized small militia activities to climb Niutuo Village Mountain. Before departure, I told the students: "The militia is the people's army, we must strictly abide by discipline and help each other like the People's Liberation Army to defeat the enemy." During the mountain climbing activities, we helped each other, the big ones helped the small ones, and the men helped the women, so that all the students climbed to the top of the mountain. Through the activities, the students were educated and strengthened their unity. That day, they also visited the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery and invited Grandpa Zhao Bingyu, an old Communist Party member, to tell the students about the liberation of Taiyuan.
    On this basis, I further lectured the students on Chairman Mao's works. Through studying "Serve the People," the students' ideological awareness improved. In the past, Li Genyuan would beat people as soon as he found out that someone had reported his situation to the teacher. After studying, he said: "Today I know that everyone gives me opinions to help me." In this way, through a series of vivid educations and patient help, the students' thinking has undergone great changes. Li Genyuan was originally the "little bully" in the class, but now he has become better. The service unit rated him as an excellent member, and later he was elected as the class chairman.
      Help Students Overcome Learning Difficulties
    Solving ideological problems and solving students' learning difficulties must be combined. In addition to tutoring students with poor grades, I also organized "one helps one, one pair red" activities, the good help the poor, the poor take the initiative to learn. When correcting homework, if I find common mistakes, I will talk about them in the whole class; if it is a problem of individual students, I will talk to him face to face, this works very well, and the students welcome it.
    Ideological problems in learning were solved through studying Chairman Mao's works. My classmates were not interested in algebra at first. Comrade Guo Jixian saw a column for soliciting opinions at the back of the algebra book, and he wrote: "Comrade Editor: This book is too difficult. If it's simpler, I have no objections." In response to this lively thought, we studied "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." Many students said: "The Foolish Old Man can move two big mountains, the Chinese Communist Party leads the people of the whole country to move the three big mountains that are pressing on our heads, can't we overcome these difficulties in learning?" Under inspiration and specific help, several students with poor grades automatically organized a study group and studied algebra in the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Removing the Mountains, and achieved good results in the final exam.
              Labor Educates New People
    In March 1965, students were organized to participate in labor at the Shengli Binding Cooperative. When they started working, the students felt fresh, but after working for a while, they became a little impatient. When binding books, they tore off one or two pages, they thought it was troublesome and no longer made them up. When the old workers saw it, they criticized: "The cover is marked as thirty sheets, but you only ordered twenty-eight sheets. If we sell these transcripts to you, would you be willing? We workers must be responsible to the people and cannot be sloppy!" The workers' meticulous spirit towards work deeply educated the students. Some students said: "The clothes are dirty, the hands are dirty, but the thoughts are red."
    Through labor, not only the students were educated, but I myself was also educated. In the past, I only gesticulated and rarely actually did it, and the students were estranged from me. Seeing the factory cadres participating in labor, I also actually did it. Through labor, a new type of teacher-student relationship was established. In the classroom, the teacher-student boundary is very clear. Entering the factory to work, the teacher-student boundary is not obvious. I am only four years older than the oldest student. I work with them, and everyone can't tell who the teacher is. I am an apprentice with them. Sometimes I can't go because I'm busy, the students learn more technology than me, I learn from the students. The relationship between teachers and students is consolidated in labor. Students are willing to talk to me about any ideological problems. When holding class meetings, they can give each other opinions, I can give students opinions, and students can also give me opinions. This is more conducive to carrying out targeted ideological and political work.
      Counselors Must be Fully Responsible for Students
    In just one year, the students' ideological awareness has been improved, their labor concepts have been strengthened, and everyone is striving to do good things. A few days ago, I opened a drawer and saw five pairs of clippers inside. I asked them who sent them, they didn't say, and finally other students "exposed" them. It turned out that some students brought clippers, soap, etc. from home and started a "barber shop". Some students used to beat and scold the elementary school students at the service point, but now they have become small counselors. They use Sundays to show slides to the small students and cut their hair for them. They also help the kitchen clean up, wash vegetables, deliver vegetables, and remove ash residue. The cooks are very moved. In the past year, the students' academic performance has also improved significantly.
    Through the practice of the past year, I deeply realize that counselors must be fully responsible for students. Counselors and students attend classes, work, and entertain together. They manage political thoughts and learning; manage labor and life; tutor language and also tutor politics, mathematics, science, chemistry, and other subjects. Therefore, counselors must comprehensively grasp students so that they can develop in all aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.
    To manage and teach students well, we must conduct in-depth investigation and research, fully understand the situation, prescribe the right medicine, and patiently guide them. We must never casually put the "backward" hat on students, and we must not use a metaphysical point of view, but use the "one divides into two" point of view to look at them. Although their shortcomings cannot be ignored, we must first pay attention to discovering their advantages. Starting from this point of view, as long as our school, factory, society, and family cooperate with each other to educate students, care about them ideologically, academically, and in life, they can grow up healthily.

### 做辅导员就是干革命

    做辅导员就是干革命
    太原电视工读中学永定路电视班辅导员  平淑华
    教育工作是革命工作
    我是太原电视工读中学永定路电视班的辅导员。当学校刚开学的时候，有的学生家长搞不清电视学校是干啥的；学生们对电视学校也不感兴趣。有的是来看“小电影”的。由于学生的学习目的不明确，加上有些学生思想品德和学习基础较差，班内的秩序较乱。上课时，有的看小说，有的唱歌，有的睡觉，有的甚至打人骂人起哄。能做作业就算是好的了，有的干脆连抄本也不带。我感到这个工作确实不好做。
    正在这个时候，学校号召学习毛主席著作。在大家的帮助下，我学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。毛主席教导我们：“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我想，党培养了自己十几年，如果现在离开，就是当了逃兵。学校领导和同志们也鼓励我干下去。他们说：“教育工作也是革命工作。”在组织的教育和鼓励下，终于安下心来。
    我开始了解学生的情况。原来班里的学生多数是劳动人民的子女，有许多是双职工的子女。有的家长忙于工作，对孩子缺少教育，一些孩子沾染了坏习气。这些家长说：“我们在工厂的时间长，和孩子见面的时间还没有你多，这孩子就交给你了。”多么恳切的嘱托啊！我感到自己肩负的责任重大。我开始认识到，教育工作本身就是阶级斗争的工具，做辅导员就是干革命。想到这里，我心里豁然开朗了，精神愉快了，愿意做这个工作了。
        照毛主席的指示办事
    自己的思想问题解决了，班里还是乱哄哄的，怎么办？最初，我用制度硬卡，但是“按下葫芦浮起瓢”，不能解决问题。我带着这个问题学习《反对本本主义》和《实践论》等文章。毛主席说：“你对那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”按照毛主席的教导，我着手深入调查。通过调查，发现学生上课不注意听讲，不完全是想捣乱。有的是基础差，上课听不懂，才不感兴趣。有的认为电视学校比不了普通中学，课程也少，学不到东西。有的感到学校生活枯燥、单调，除了听课、劳动，就是上自习，没有文娱活动。
    针对这些问题，我一面耐心地进行说服教育，一面在具体问题上给他们一些帮助。对基础差的学生，加强了辅导，帮助他们补习功课。我又把普通中学的考题给学生们试做，有的也能做出来，消除了他们认为电视学校学不到知识的想法。我也请家长来参观、听课，有些家长看到电视机图象清晰，教师话音响亮，也消除了用电视无法进行教学的想法。同时，请小学的体育、音乐课教师兼课，充实了课外活动的内容，使学生的正当要求得到了满足。
    然后，我又向他们原来的小学和他们的家长和街坊作调查，逐步摸清了班里学生的情况。最初，我好心好意地帮助同学，他们却不理我，甚至还跟我顶撞，根本意识不到老师是关心他们。这时，我又向毛主席著作请教，学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，认识到要把学生教育好，除了加强思想政治教育外，还应该在生活上关心他们。例如，通过了解，知道李根源在小学一年级时，母亲就死了，他父亲是一个老工人，家里无人照顾，还得自己做饭，常常迟到。因此我就主动帮助他解决一些困难，还告诉他如何争取时间把饭做好。从此，他认识到老师是在真心帮助他，师生的感情好了，他也一天天进步了。我也关心全班同学，在生活上和劳动中处处以身作则，与同学们的关系也就一天天好起来了。
            大抓阶级教育
    同学们年龄小，只给他们讲抽象的大道理，是不易接受的。于是，我就通过活生生的事例进行阶级教育。
    首先，组织同学们访问劳动人民的家庭，写家史。通过这一活动，启发劳动人民家庭出身的同学谈家史，让他们认识过去的苦。其次，我还组织学生参观阶级教育展览，请“三老”（老红军、老党员、老工人）作报告。通过谈家史、讲革命故事，启发学生珍惜今天的幸福生活。
    一九六五年五月，结合全民皆兵的教育，班里组织了小民兵活动，去牛驼寨登山。出发前，我给学生讲：“民兵是人民的子弟兵，必须象解放军那样严格遵守纪律，互相帮助，才能战胜敌人。”在登山活动中，互相帮助，大的帮小的，男的帮女的，使全体同学都登上了山顶。通过活动，使同学们受到了教育，加强了团结。那天，还参观了革命烈士陵园，邀请老共产党员赵炳玉大爷给同学讲解放太原的经过。
    在这个基础上，我进一步给学生讲毛主席著作。通过学习《为人民服务》，同学们思想觉悟提高了。过去李根源一发现别人向老师反映他的情况就打人，学习后，他说：“今天我知道了，大家给我提意见是为了帮助我。”就这样，通过一系列活生生的教育和耐心的帮助，同学们的思想发生了很大的变化。李根源原来是班里的“小霸王”，现在变好了，设点单位评他为优秀队员，以后又被选为班主席。
      帮助学生克服学习上的困难
    解决思想问题和解决学生学习上的困难要结合起来，我除了给成绩差的学生补课外，还组织“一帮一，一对红”的活动，好的帮差的，差的主动学。在批改作业时，发现了普遍性的错误，我便在全班里讲；如果是个别学生的问题，我便找他面谈，这样做效果很好，学生很欢迎。
    学习上的思想问题，通过学习毛主席著作得到了解决。我班同学开始对代数不感兴趣，郭继仙同学看见代数书后面有征求意见栏，他便写道：“编者同志：这本书太难了。再简单一些，我就没有意见了。”针对这个活思想，我们学习了《愚公移山》。许多同学说：“愚公能搬掉两座大山，中国共产党领导全国人民搬掉压在我们头上的三座大山，难道我们就不能克服学习上的这点困难吗？”在启发诱导和具体的帮助下，几个成绩差的学生自动组织了学习小组，用愚公移山的精神学习代数，到期末考试，取得了良好成绩。
              劳动育新人
    一九六五年三月，组织学生到胜利装订社参加劳动。开始劳动时，同学们感到新鲜，后来干了一阵，有点不耐烦了。订本子时撕掉一两张，他们嫌麻烦，不再补足。老工人看见了，便批评说：“本来封面注明是三十张，你订的只有二十八张，如果把这些抄本卖给你们，愿意不愿意？我们工人做事，要对人民负责，可不能马虎！”工人们对待工作一丝不苟的精神，深深地教育了学生。有的同学说：“衣服脏了，手脏了，但是思想红了。”
    通过劳动，不仅教育了学生，也教育了我自己。过去自己只是指手划脚，很少实际干，同学们也对自己疏远。我看到工厂干部参加劳动，自己也实际干起来。通过劳动，建立了新型的师生关系。在课堂上，师生界限很分明。进厂劳动，师生界限就不明显了。我比最大的同学只大四岁。我和他们一块劳动，大家也认不出谁是老师。我和他们一块当徒弟。有时因为工作忙去不了，学生学的技术比自己多了，我就向学生学习。师生间的感情在劳动中巩固起来。同学们有什么思想问题，愿意主动跟我交谈了。开班会的时候，能互相提意见，我给学生提意见，学生也能给我提意见。这样，就更有利于进行针对性的思想政治工作了。
      辅导员要对学生全面负责
    短短一年的时间，同学们的思想觉悟提高了，劳动观点加强了，人人争着办好事。前些日子，我拉开抽屉一看，里面有五把推子。我问他们是谁送来的，他们都不说，最后还是别的同学“揭发”出来的。原来是有的学生从家里拿来推子、肥皂等，办起了“理发站”。有的学生以前打骂设点单位的小学生，现在变成小辅导员了，他们利用星期日给小同学放幻灯，还替小同学理发。他们还帮灶房打扫、洗菜、送菜、掏灰渣，炊事员很受感动。一年来，学生的学习成绩也有了显著的提高。
    通过一年来的实践，我深深认识到，辅导员要对学生全面负责。辅导员和学生同上课、同劳动、同娱乐。既管政治思想，又管学习；既管劳动，又管生活；既要辅导语文，又要辅导政治、数学、理化和其他各科。因此，辅导员要全面抓学生，使他们能够在德、智、体几方面都得到发展。
    要管好教好学生，必须深入调查研究，全面摸清情况，对症下药，循循善诱，千万不能随便给学生戴落后的“帽子”，不能用形而上学的观点，而要用“一分为二”的观点去看他们。对于他们的缺点固然不能忽视，但首先要注意发现他们的优点。从这一观点出发，只要我们学校、工厂、社会和家庭各方面互相配合起来，对学生进行教育，从思想上、学习上、生活上关心他们，就能使他们健康地成长起来。（附图片）
