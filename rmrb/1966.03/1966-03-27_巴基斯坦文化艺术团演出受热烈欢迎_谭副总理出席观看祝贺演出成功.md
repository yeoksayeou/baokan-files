    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 26th. The Cultural and Art Troupe from our friendly neighbor Pakistan gave its first performance at the National Cultural Palace tonight. The Pakistani artists' performances, rich in national characteristics, were warmly welcomed by the audience in the capital.
    Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin watched the performance by the Pakistani artists.
    Tonight, among the thirteen song and dance programs performed by the artists, there were the East Pakistan dances "Indigo Planting Farmers" and "Happy Fishermen," reflecting the laboring people's spirit of diligence and bravery; and the enthusiastic and unrestrained West Pakistan's "Spring Dance" and "Jhoomer Dance." The "Indigo Planting Farmers" dance performed by the artists depicts the scene of the Bengali people opposing foreign aggressors and farm owners two hundred years ago. The farmers, unable to endure the heavy exploitation and oppression by the farm owners and the brutal persecution by foreign aggressors, launched a riot and finally achieved victory. The artists also sang Chinese songs "The East is Red," "Unity is Strength," and "Nanniwan" in Chinese, which the audience found particularly cordial. All the performances were warmly applauded by the audience. The audience expressed the Chinese people's friendship towards the Pakistani people to the artists.
    Before the performance, an opening ceremony was held.
    Yang Chun, Deputy Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Commission, spoke at the opening ceremony, expressing warm welcome and sincere congratulations to the Pakistani artists.
    Yang Chun said that the people of China and Pakistan have a deep traditional friendship. President Ayub Khan visited our country at the invitation in 1965, and now Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Chen Yi are visiting your country. The mutual visits of our two national leaders have greatly enhanced the friendly relations between the two countries and strengthened the good cooperation between the two peoples in promoting Asian-African solidarity and opposing imperialism and new and old colonialism.
    Leader of the troupe Rahman said in his speech that friendship, trade, and cultural relations for centuries have linked China and Pakistan together. China is Pakistan's greatest and most friendly neighbor. China has proved not only in words but also in deeds that she is one of Pakistan's most loyal and sincere friends, especially in the most difficult moments in our history. We are deeply convinced that this friendship will continue to be strengthened and developed. It is precisely because of the encouragement of this friendship and the desire to learn from you that we have traveled thousands of miles to visit and perform in your country.
    He said that we are here at a very unusual moment. The great leaders of your country are visiting our country. I believe that the people of our country must be welcoming them with thunderous cheers and enthusiasm.
    Attending the opening ceremony and watching the performance were also Ding Xilin, Zhao Xinchu, Fang Shishan, Xu Jingwu, Zhou Weizhi, Wang Yuanfang, Dai Ailian, Ding Bo and other responsible persons from relevant departments and literary and art circles in the capital.
    Charge d'affaires ad interim Durrani of the Pakistani Embassy in China and Mrs. Rocha, the Ambassador's wife, were invited to attend the opening ceremony.
    Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.
    After the performance, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin and others, accompanied by Charge d'affaires ad interim Durrani, walked onto the stage and warmly shook hands with the Pakistani artists, congratulating them on their successful performance. (Attached picture)

    谭副总理出席观看祝贺演出成功
    据新华社二十六日讯　来自友好邻邦巴基斯坦的文化艺术团，今晚在民族文化宫举行首次演出。巴基斯坦艺术家们富有民族特色的表演，受到首都观众的热烈欢迎。
    谭震林副总理观看了巴基斯坦艺术家的演出。
    今晚，艺术家们演出的十三个歌舞节目中，有反映劳动人民勤劳、勇敢的斗争精神的东巴舞蹈《种靛青草的农民》和《快乐的渔夫》；还有热情奔放的西巴的《春之舞》和《“新加色”舞》。艺术家们表演的《种靛青草的农民》舞蹈，是描写孟加拉人民在两百年前反对外来侵略者和农场主的情景，农民不堪忍受农场主的重重剥削、压迫和外来侵略者残暴迫害，进行暴动，最后取得了胜利。艺术家们还用中文演唱的中国歌曲《东方红》、《团结就是力量》和《南泥湾》，观众特别感到亲切。全部演出节目，都受到观众的热烈鼓掌。观众向艺术家们表示中国人民对巴基斯坦人民的友谊。
    演出前，举行开幕式。
    对外文委副主任杨纯在开幕式上讲话，向巴基斯坦的艺术家们表示热烈欢迎和衷心祝贺。
    杨纯说，中巴两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊。一九六五年阿尤布·汗总统应邀访问了我国，现在刘少奇主席和陈毅副总理正在访问贵国。我们两个国家领导人的相互访问，大大增进了两国的友好关系，加强了两国人民在促进亚非团结、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的事业中的良好合作。
    拉赫曼团长在讲话中说，几个世纪以来的友谊、贸易和文化关系，把中国和巴基斯坦联系在一起。中国是巴基斯坦最伟大、最友好的邻邦。中国不仅用语言而且用行动，证明了她是巴基斯坦最忠实、最诚恳的朋友之一，特别是在我国历史上最困难的时刻。我们深信这一友谊将不断获得加强和发展。也正是由于这种友情的鼓舞和向你们学习的愿望，我们才不远千里来到你们国家访问演出。
    他说，我们是在一个很不寻常的时刻来到这里的。你们国家伟大的领导人已在我国访问。我相信我们国家的人民一定正在兴高彩烈地以春雷一般的欢呼和热情来接待他们。
    出席开幕式和观看演出的，还有丁西林、赵辛初、方石珊、徐净武、周巍峙、王元方、戴爱莲、丁波等有关方面负责人和首都文艺界人士。
