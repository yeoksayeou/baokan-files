    A Profound Revelation
    Leaders must arm others with Mao Zedong Thought, but first they must study Chairman Mao's works themselves. Without studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, they are not qualified to be leaders.
    In recent days, my heart has been stirred by Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, giving rise to an extremely strong desire: I must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well, put great effort into the word "apply," and use my own revolutionization to drive the revolutionization of the troops, so that our cadres and soldiers will forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and forever serve the people of China and the people of the world.
    Chairman Mao said, "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the deciding factor." He also said, "To lead a great revolution, there must be a great party, and there must be many of the best cadres." Comrade Jiao Yulu profoundly understood these teachings of Chairman Mao. He armed himself with Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, in the most vivid and powerful way, he armed the cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. From this, I have gained a profound revelation: the most important responsibility of leaders is to arm cadres and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought. And to arm others, leaders must first be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought themselves. Without mastering Mao Zedong Thought, they are not qualified to be leaders.
    In the past, for a period of time, some companies practiced throwing grenades, shooting, and climbing mountains all day long, thinking this was the most important preparation for war. But later, after a comprehensive inspection, the Third Company, which we originally thought was the best, not only did not make breakthroughs in technology, but also had some problems. This was a big shock to us. After studying it over and over again, we discovered that the root cause was in ourselves: we had not insisted on putting the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works first. If the leadership's thinking is not revolutionized, how can we bring out a revolutionized office, a revolutionized troop?
    Personal lessons are convincing. We started with the leadership, focusing on ideological transformation, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, honestly linking it to reality, and honestly transforming our thinking. At the same time, we passed on our study experiences to the cadres and soldiers and absorbed their study experiences, both leading the troops in studying and enriching and improving ourselves. When the leadership correctly positioned the study of Chairman Mao's works, the offices followed suit, the companies learned to follow suit, and the positions of politics and military affairs, ideology and technology, were also straightened out. As a result, the spiritual outlook of the troops underwent profound changes, all tasks were promoted, and war preparedness work became more solid.
    From Comrade Jiao Yulu leading the people of Lankao County on the road of revolutionization, combined with my own personal experience, I have once again been educated: as a leading cadre, taking the lead in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and leading the troops in their study, is the demand of the times and the task given to us by the Party that is higher than everything else. I am determined to lead the study of Chairman Mao's works for the rest of my life, implement the five principles put forward by Comrade Lin Biao in the troops, and lead the troops to carry out the revolution thoroughly.

    一个深刻的启示
    领导者要用毛泽东思想武装别人，首先自己要学习毛主席著作，不学习和掌握毛泽东思想，就没有资格当领导。
    这些天来，我的心一直被焦裕禄同志的革命精神激荡着，产生了一个极其强烈的愿望：一定要象焦裕禄同志那样，带头学好用好毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用自己的革命化，去带动部队的革命化，让我们的干部战士，永远忠实于毛泽东思想，永远为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”又说：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。”焦裕禄同志是深刻理解毛主席这些教导的。他用毛泽东思想武装自己，同时以最生动最有力的办法，用毛泽东思想武装干部。从这里我得到一个深刻的启示：领导者的责任，最重要的就是用毛泽东思想武装干部和战士。而领导者要武装别人，首先就要象焦裕禄同志那样，自己学习和掌握毛泽东思想。不掌握毛泽东思想，就没有资格当领导。
    过去有一段时间，有些连队整天练投弹、射击、爬山，以为这是最重要的战备；可是后来全面检查，原来以为最好的三连，不仅技术没有突上去，反而出了一些问题。这对我们是个很大震动。我们研究来研究去，发现根子原来在自己身上，没有坚持把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位。领导思想不革命化，怎么能带出革命化的机关、革命化的部队呢？
    切身的教训是有说服力的。我们首先从领导开始，以改造思想为主，天天坚持学习毛主席著作，老老实实地联系实际，老老实实地改造思想。同时把自己的学习体会传给干部战士，把下面的学习体会吸收进来，既领导了部队学习，又丰富提高了自己。领导思想把学习毛主席著作位置摆对了，机关也跟着摆，连队也学着摆，政治和军事，思想和技术的位置也都摆正了。结果部队的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，各项工作都搞上去了，战备工作也搞得更加扎实了。
    从焦裕禄同志带动兰考县人民走革命化的道路中，联想自己切身的经验，我再次受到了教育：身为领导干部，带头活学活用毛主席著作，并领导好部队学习，这是时代对我们的要求，党给我们的高于一切的任务。我决心带头学习毛主席著作一辈子，把林彪同志提出的五项原则在部队落实，领导部队彻头彻尾干革命。
