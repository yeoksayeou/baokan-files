    Editor's Note: "Emphasizing politics is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in spring planting." This slogan, put forward by newspapers in many provinces and regions, shows the new situation and characteristics of spring planting this year.
    Emphasizing politics in spring planting means using Mao Zedong Thought to take command, bringing political and ideological work into the midst of production, raising the consciousness of the masses, and ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's agricultural production plan. As the *Ningxia Daily* editorial says, "Only with high standards of people's thinking can we have high quality in spring planting production."
    Emphasizing politics is the top priority of party committees at all levels. Whether or not politics can be well emphasized in spring planting depends on the leadership. The *Gansu Daily* editorial pointed out that leading cadres at all levels should step out of their offices, take Comrade Mao Zedong's works and labor tools with them, go to the front line of spring planting, go to the most arduous and difficult places of struggle, participate in production, and lead production. We say that emphasizing politics is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in spring planting, and the revolutionization of leadership is the fundamental guarantee for emphasizing politics. With these two guarantees, we will surely be able to win this battle of spring planting this year.
    Many Provincial Newspapers Publish Commentaries Pointing Out
    Emphasizing Politics Is the Fundamental Guarantee for Doing a Good Job in Spring Planting
    (Our report) Recently, many provincial and regional newspapers have published news and commentaries on spring planting. These commentaries point out that this year's spring planting is the first spring planting of the Third Five-Year Plan, and we must work hard to win this battle and lay a solid foundation for striving for a comprehensive and bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.
    Spring planting is time-constrained and task-heavy. What should we rely on to win this battle? These newspapers pointed out that of all the measures, emphasizing politics is the first and foremost. Emphasizing politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most fundamental guarantee for seizing a complete victory in spring planting.
          The Busier We Are with Production, the More We Must Emphasize Politics
    The *Ningxia Daily*, in an editorial entitled "The Busier We Are, the More We Must Emphasize Politics," said: Some people say, "Spring planting is an urgent matter. We are too busy to even grasp production, let alone have time to grasp politics." These arguments that oppose politics and production, and deny politics taking command under the pretext of "being busy with production," are extremely wrong and extremely harmful.
    The editorial pointed out that everyone is busy working to do a good job in spring planting, but why are some communes and teams doing a good job, while others are not? The fundamental reason lies in the different levels of awareness, different mental states, and different revolutionary drive of the people. And the improvement of people's awareness and the unleashing of subjective initiative depend on strong ideological and political work. The busier we are with spring planting and the heavier the tasks, the more we must, like the People's Liberation Army, bring political work to the front lines, the more we must convey the Party's policies to the masses, and fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses to complete the tasks. The busier we are with spring planting and the heavier the tasks, the more we must grasp living ideas and solve ideological problems at any time and any place. Only with unified understanding can we have unified action. The busier we are with spring planting and the heavier the tasks, the more we must make the masses aware of the important significance of completing spring planting tasks and implement the idea of farming for the revolution into the practical actions of doing a good job in spring planting. The human factor comes first. Emphasizing politics, doing a good job of people's work, and having high standards of people's thinking are the basis for high quality in spring planting production.
    The *Southern Daily*, in a short commentary with the same title, said: For cadres themselves, the busier they are with work, the more they must emphasize politics and study Chairman Mao's works. Because the busier the work, the more problems and contradictions are encountered. How to correctly analyze and resolve contradictions? Of all the methods, studying Chairman Mao's works and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the first. Only by mastering the stand, viewpoint, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly analyze various contradictions, resolve contradictions, and control contradictions, and take the initiative in the face of contradictions, so as not to be confused by them. Being busy with work also means there is more work to do, and more experiences and lessons to be summarized. To correctly summarize experiences and lessons, we must also study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind and master the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought in order to truly summarize the experiences and lessons. In this way, work can make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, reduce confusion, strive for initiative, and do a good job.
        Using Ideological Preparation to Promote Material Preparation
    The *Southern Daily* published a report on the Zengcheng County Party Committee in Guangdong organizing grassroots cadres to study Chairman Mao's works to do a good job in preparing for spring planting, and also published an editorial entitled "Ideological Preparation." The editorial said: The Zengcheng County Party Committee adopted the method of training classes to organize grassroots cadres of people's communes to study Chairman Mao's works, making ideological preparations for a greater upsurge in agricultural production. This training class was conducted flexibly, with a high degree of ideology, and grasped the fundamental issues.
    This time, the leaders of Zengcheng County grasped the living ideas in production, not dealing with matters on a case-by-case basis, not only grasping phenomena, but grasping the essence through phenomena. They conducted investigations and studies on the ideological trends of grassroots cadres, made specific analyses, and summarized them as the contradiction between "public" and "private," raising the issue from the height of revolution and non-revolution, and from the significance of transforming the world outlook, guiding cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and using advanced figures as mirrors to examine their thinking and, through recollection and comparison, uncover the lid of "selfishness" and investigate the harm of "selfishness," so that cadres can consciously break private interests and establish public interests. Their practice proves that this approach is active, deep, and effective.
    Breaking private interests and establishing public interests means breaking the bourgeois world outlook and establishing the proletarian world outlook. This is a long-term and complex ideological struggle process that requires sharp weapons. Chairman Mao's works are the sharpest weapons. For some ideological problems of grassroots cadres, such as fear of suffering losses and wanting to retreat, various localities have taken some specific measures in the past to solve them and have achieved some results, but they cannot fundamentally solve the problems. This time, Zengcheng County organized grassroots cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and transform people, and the effect was very significant.
            Encourage Real Effort, Not Empty Effort
    The *Jiangxi Daily*, in an editorial entitled "Do a Solid Job in Preparing for Spring Planting," said: What is the key to striving for a greater agricultural harvest this year? The experience of many regions proves that the key is still the mental state of the people, that is, whether or not they have revolutionary thought and revolutionary drive.
    How to encourage drive, and what kind of drive is needed? There are two approaches: one is to encourage empty effort, and the other is to encourage real effort. Only talking about high targets, shouting slogans, only being busy with meetings and visits, and being satisfied with the superficial excitement, without doing in-depth and meticulous work in a solid manner, is encouraging empty effort. Encouraging this kind of effort will not achieve the expected results for the cause of revolution and construction, but will only be a temporary excitement.
    Engaging in class struggle and production struggle is a struggle to constantly explore, grasp, and apply objective laws, and constantly move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. We must prevent and oppose encouraging empty effort and advocate encouraging real effort. We must encourage revolutionary drive to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, encourage it to correctly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, encourage it to conduct in-depth investigations and studies and act in accordance with objective laws, and encourage it to rely on the masses, work in a solid manner, and discover and solve problems. We must have both advanced indicators and solid and reliable measures, "think of the worst and strive for the best," so that we can guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the plan in favorable circumstances, and strive to complete the plan even in difficult circumstances. Only in this way can our work be solid and truly encourage real effort.
          To Be Confident, We Must Be Prepared
    The *Xinjiang Daily* published an editorial entitled "To Be Confident, We Must Be Prepared," saying: Whether the autonomous region's agriculture can be further improved on the basis of continuous production increases for four consecutive years, and first do a better job in preparing for spring planting and spring planting, and strive to achieve the goal of continuous agricultural production increases for five consecutive years, depends on whether we can further emphasize politics in all our work, and whether we can use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything.
    The editorial used the Eighth Agricultural Division and the Hotan Prefecture as examples to illustrate the great power of emphasizing politics. The editorial said: The most fundamental reason why the Eighth Agricultural Division's preparation for spring planting is better than last year is that they further emphasized politics, eliminated the mental state of "small increase in production, small progress, and small development," and established the lofty aspiration of "large increase in production, large progress, and large development." The most fundamental reason why Hotan Prefecture has done a good job in water, fertilizer, and afforestation is that the broad masses of cadres and members creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, established the idea of "farming for the revolution," and based themselves on the situation that "water shortage, strong winds, many insects, and early frost" may be more serious than last year, grasped measures, and thought of the worst and strived for the best.
    The editorial said: Is it "large increase in production, large progress, and large development," or "small increase in production, small progress, and small development"? Is it thinking of the worst, or placing hope on possibly good natural conditions? This reflects two different mental states. The former is the highly revolutionary thought of daring to struggle, daring to win, and constantly moving forward. Under the guidance of this highly revolutionary thought, we will be full of vigor, strive to be upstream, take a positive attitude, and in practical actions, we will have great drive and steady steps, step by step, and the result will be more, faster, better, and more economical. On the contrary, the latter is a mental state of pride and complacency, sticking to conventions, and being content with being in the middle reaches. Under the domination of this mental state, we will be listless and inactive in the face of nature, adopt a negative attitude, and treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The result will be less, slower, worse, and more expensive. The former conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction and must be adhered to and carried forward; the latter must be overcome and corrected.
            Go Deep into Reality, Go Deep into the Masses
    The commentaries of many newspapers have proposed that to emphasize politics in spring planting and preparation work, we must go deep into the masses and deep into reality like Jiao Yulu. The editorial of the *Liaoning Daily* said: The sowing period is now approaching, and there are only about two months left for the sowing of cotton fields and large fields, and the seedling cultivation of paddy fields. In these short dozens of days, we must protect soil moisture, prepare water sources, and do all the preparatory work for drought-resistant sowing and drought-resistant rice planting. Obviously, time is tight and the task is very arduous. How to complete this arduous task? Of all the measures, the most fundamental one is to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and realize the revolutionization of leadership thinking and leadership style. We must treat natural disasters like Comrade Jiao Yulu, show heroism in the face of disasters, do not fantasize, do not rely on heaven, and stubbornly fight against drought, and have a determination and perseverance not to give up until we overcome drought. The editorial of the *Gansu Daily* said: To lead spring planting well and do all the work well, leaders at all levels and the broad masses of cadres must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses" and quickly go deep into the front lines, like Jiao Yulu: "living in the thatched huts of old poor peasants, squatting in cowsheds, eating with the masses, and working together," and turn themselves into rural "adobe makers" covered in mud. Because of studying Jiao Yulu, the leadership style of many units has changed rapidly recently. However, the leadership style of many of our comrades is still far inferior to that of Comrade Jiao Yulu. Therefore, we must continue to focus on this issue. We must make our leading comrades at all levels and the broad masses of cadres go out of their offices as much as possible, taking Chairman Mao's works, labor tools, and Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit with them, go to the front line of spring planting, go to the most arduous and difficult places of struggle; eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses, study Chairman Mao's works with them; be considerate of their sufferings, solve their difficulties, conduct serious investigations and studies, personally cultivate models, and promote the competition of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other in a down-to-earth manner. Only in this way can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, can we timely discover and solve various problems in spring planting and various tasks, can we correctly summarize and promote the rich experience of the masses, can we thoroughly win this battle of spring planting, and can we do a good job in various tasks.

### 许多省区报纸发表评论指出  突出政治是搞好春耕生产的根本保证

专栏：

    编者按：“突出政治是搞好春耕生产的根本保证。”许多省区报纸提出的这个口号，表明了今年各地春耕生产的新形势和特点。
    在春耕生产中突出政治，就是用毛泽东思想挂帅，把政治思想工作做到生产中间去，提高群众的觉悟，保证完成和超额完成今年的农业生产计划。正象《宁夏日报》社论所说的，“有了人的思想上的高标准，才能有春耕生产的高质量”。
    突出政治，是各级党委的头等大事。在春耕生产中，能不能很好地突出政治，关键在于领导。《甘肃日报》的社论指出，各级领导干部要走出办公室，带上毛泽东同志的著作，带上劳动工具，到春耕第一线去，到斗争最艰巨、最困难的地方去，参加生产，领导生产。我们说，突出政治是搞好春耕生产的根本保证，领导革命化是突出政治的根本保证。有了这两个保证，今年春耕生产这一仗，就一定能打好。
    许多省区报纸发表评论指出
    突出政治是搞好春耕生产的根本保证
    本报讯　最近，许多省区报纸发表了有关春耕生产的消息和评论。这些评论指出，今年的春耕，是第三个五年计划的第一个春耕，必须努力打好这一仗，为争取今年农业生产的全面丰收打下坚实的基础。
    春耕时间紧，任务重，靠什么来打好这一仗？这些报纸指出，千条万条，突出政治是第一条。突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，是夺取春耕全胜的最根本的保证。
          生产越忙越要突出政治
    《宁夏日报》在一篇题为《越忙越要突出政治》的社论里说：有的人说：“春耕是火烧眉毛的事，光抓生产都忙不过来，哪有工夫抓政治呢？”这些把政治和生产对立起来，借口“生产忙”来否定政治挂帅的论调，是十分错误、十分有害的。
    社论指出，大家同是为搞好春耕而忙，为什么有的社队就忙得好，有的社队却忙得不好呢？根本原因就在于人的觉悟不同，精神状态不同，革命干劲不同。而人们觉悟的提高，主观能动性的发挥，都要靠强有力的思想政治工作。春耕越忙，任务越重，就越要象解放军那样，把政治工作做到火线上去，就越要把党的政策交给群众，把广大群众的社会主义积极性充分地调动起来，去完成任务；春耕越忙，任务越重，就越要狠抓活思想，随时随地解决思想问题，有了统一认识，才能有统一行动；春耕越忙，任务越重，就越要使群众知道完成春耕任务的重要意义，把为革命种田的思想教育落实到搞好春耕的实际行动上来。人的因素第一。突出了政治，做好了人的工作，有了人的思想上的高标准，才能有春耕生产的高质量。
    《南方日报》在一篇同一题目的短评里说：对干部本身来说，工作越忙越要突出政治，越要学习毛主席著作。因为工作越忙，说明遇到的问题多，矛盾多。怎样正确地分析和解决矛盾？办法千条万条，学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想是第一条。只有掌握了毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，才能正确地分析各种矛盾，解决矛盾，驾驭矛盾，在矛盾面前掌握主动权，而不致被它弄得眼花缭乱，手足无措。工作忙，还说明工作多，需要总结的经验教训也多，要正确地总结经验教训，同样也要带着问题去学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想武器，才能真正把经验教训总结出来。这样，工作才能有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进；才能减少忙乱，争取主动，把工作做好。
        用思想备耕促进物质备耕
    《南方日报》发表了广东增城县委组织基层干部学习毛主席著作搞好备耕工作的报道，同时发表了一篇题为《思想备耕》的社论。社论说：增城县委采取训练班的方式，组织人民公社基层干部学习毛主席著作，为掀起农业生产的更大高潮作好思想准备。这个训练班办得活，思想性高，抓住了根本性的问题。
    增城县的领导这次抓生产中的活思想，不是就事论事，不是只抓现象，而是透过现象抓住了本质。他们对基层干部的思想动态进行调查研究，加以具体分析，归结为“公”与“私”的矛盾，从革命与不革命的高度，从改造世界观的意义上提出问题，引导干部学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，以先进人物为镜子，对照检查思想，并通过回忆对比，揭“私”字的盖子，查“私”字的毒害，使干部自觉地去破私立公。他们的实践证明，这样抓，抓得活，抓得深，效果好。
    破私立公，就是破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观，这是一个长期、复杂的思想斗争过程，需要有锐利的武器。毛主席的著作就是最锐利的武器。对于一些基层干部怕吃亏、想退坡等思想问题，过去各地都曾采取过一些具体措施去解决，并获得一些效果，但都不能从根本上解决问题。增城县这次组织基层干部学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来教育人、改造人，效果就很显著。
            鼓实劲，不要鼓虚劲
    《江西日报》在一篇题为《扎扎实实搞好备耕》的社论里说：争取今年农业更大丰收的关键是什么？许多地区的经验证明，关键还是人的精神状态问题，也即是有没有革命思想、革命干劲的问题。
    干劲怎样鼓，要什么样的干劲？有两种作法：一种是鼓虚劲，一种是鼓实劲。光讲高指标，喊口号，只忙于开会、参观，满足于形式上的热热闹闹，不扎扎实实地做深入细致的工作，就是鼓虚劲。鼓这种劲，对革命和建设事业，是收不到预期效果的，只不过热闹一时罢了。
    搞阶级斗争，搞生产斗争，是一个不断探索、掌握和运用客观规律，不断从必然王国到自由王国的斗争。我们一定要防止和反对鼓虚劲，提倡鼓实劲。要把革命干劲鼓到活学活用毛主席著作上，鼓到正确贯彻执行党的方针、政策上，鼓到深入调查研究、按照客观规律办事上，鼓到依靠群众、扎扎实实工作、发现问题和解决问题上。做到既有先进的指标，又有扎实可靠的措施，“从坏处着想，从好处努力”，在顺利的情况下能保证完成和超额完成计划，在困难的情况下也能力争完成计划。这样工作才过得硬才真正是鼓实劲。
          要有把握，就要有准备
    《新疆日报》发表一篇题为《要有把握，就要有准备》的社论说：今年，自治区的农业能不能在连续四年增产的基础之上，首先把备耕和春耕搞得更好，争取实现农业连续五年增产的奋斗目标，取决于我们在一切工作中，能不能进一步突出政治，能不能用毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    社论以农八师、和田专区为例，说明突出政治的巨大威力。社论说：农八师的备耕工作所以比去年搞得好，最根本的一条，是他们进一步突出政治，扫除“小增产、小进步、小发展”的精神状态，树立“大增产、大进步、大发展”的雄心壮志。和田专区的水、肥、造林等工作所以抓得好，最根本的原因，是广大干部和社员活学活用毛泽东思想，树立“为革命种田”的思想，立足于“水少、风大、虫多、霜早”比去年可能更严重的情况下，狠抓措施，从最坏处设想，向最好处努力的结果。
    社论说：是“大增产、大进步、大发展”，还是“小增产、小进步、小发展”？是从最坏处设想，还是把希望寄托在可能好的自然条件上？这反映了两种不同的精神状态。前者是敢于斗争，敢于胜利，不断前进的高度的革命思想。在这种高度的革命思想的指导下，就会意气风发，力争上游，采取积极的态度，在实际行动中，干劲大，步子稳，一步一个脚印，结果是多快好省。与之相反，后者是骄傲自满、故步自封，甘居中游的精神状态。在这种精神状态支配下，在大自然面前，萎靡不振，无所作为，采取消极的态度，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，结果是少慢差费。前者符合毛泽东思想，符合党的社会主义建设总路线精神，必须坚持和发扬；后者则必须克服改正。
            深入实际，深入群众
    不少报纸的评论都提出：要在春耕生产和备耕工作中突出政治，就要象焦裕禄那样深入群众，深入实际。《辽宁日报》的社论说：现在播种期已经迫近，棉田大田的播种和水田泡田育苗，只剩两个月左右的时间了。在这短短的几十天里，我们要保好墒，备好水源，做好一切抗旱播种、抗旱插秧的准备工作，显然时间很紧，任务是很繁重的。怎样完成这个艰巨任务呢？千条万条，最根本的一条就是活学活用毛主席著作，实现领导思想和领导作风的革命化。要象焦裕禄同志那样对待自然灾害，在灾害面前逞英雄，不幻想，不靠天，顽强地同干旱作斗争，要有一种不战胜干旱决不罢休的决心和毅力。《甘肃日报》的社论说：要领导好春耕，要做好各项工作，各级领导和广大干部，必须遵照毛主席的从群众中来、到群众中去的教导，迅速深入到第一线去，象焦裕禄那样：“住在老贫农的草庵子里，蹲在牛棚里，跟群众一起吃饭，一起劳动”，把自己变成满身泥水的农村“脱坯人”。由于学习焦裕禄，最近，有不少单位的领导作风改变的很快。但是，我们不少同志的领导作风，比起焦裕禄同志来还远远不如。所以，我们当前还要大抓这个问题。要使我们各级领导同志和广大干部，尽可能多地走出办公室，带上毛主席著作，带上劳动工具，带上焦裕禄同志的革命精神，到春耕第一线去，到斗争最艰巨、最困难的地方去；和贫下中农、广大群众同吃、同住、同劳动，同他们一起学习毛主席著作；体贴他们的疾苦，解决他们的困难，认真进行调查研究，亲自培养样板，踏踏实实地促进比学赶帮超竞赛运动。只有这样，我们才能充分地调动群众的积极性，才能及时发现和解决春耕和各项工作中的各种问题，才能正确地总结和推广群众中丰富的经验，才能彻底打胜春耕这一仗，才能搞好各项工作。
