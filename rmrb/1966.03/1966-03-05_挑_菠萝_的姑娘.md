    The Girl Who Picks "Pineapples"
    Hu Benying
    The Origin of the Title
    In Guangwei County, Ha Tay Province, North Vietnam, we met a brave female militia model, whom everyone calls the girl who picks "pineapples." At first glance, we thought this girl was a member of an agricultural cooperative who became famous for picking pineapples. In fact, she is a female accountant at a brick factory, and the "pineapples" she picks are not the pineapples people usually eat, but bombs dropped by the American bandits. So, how did she get the title of the girl who picks "pineapples"?
    The story is this:
    At noon on July 27th last year, a batch of American bandit planes bombed the Shuaihai Reservoir in Ha Tay for the first time. At that time, Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh, a female accountant and militia member of the Shuaihai Brick Factory, was on a business trip in Son Tay city. When she heard the news of the American bandits committing atrocities, her heart was immediately filled with the flames of anger. She hurriedly rode her bicycle back to the factory. She wanted to rush back and fight alongside everyone to severely punish the American bandits. But when she returned to the factory, it was already dusk. Five enemy planes had been shot down, and the rest fled in panic. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh deeply regretted not being able to participate in this battle. At this time, a comrade from the county headquarters was teaching the militiamen how to dismantle pineapple bombs (a type of small anti-personnel bomb used by the United States, yellow, and about the size of a pineapple, hence the name). She immediately joined the study. Afterwards, the comrade from the county headquarters asked two militiamen to go with her to the reservoir to clear the pineapple bombs dropped by the American bandits that day, and explained that this work was very dangerous and required great courage. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh thought to herself: she had not been able to personally strike at American planes, and she could not miss this opportunity to clear American bombs, so she resolutely requested to go, expressing her determination to withstand the test. The leadership agreed to her request. She didn't even bother to eat dinner, and set off with a small oil lamp with two other comrades.
    Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh arrived at the reservoir. Under the weak light of the oil lamp, she saw unexploded pineapple bombs scattered haphazardly on the road below the dam. Vehicles serving the battle on both ends of the road were unable to pass due to the obstruction of the pineapple bombs. "The battle needs ammunition so much!" Thinking of this, Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh wished she could sweep away all these pineapple bombs immediately. However, when she picked up the first pineapple bomb, her heart was pounding, and her hands were trembling a little, fearing that the bomb might explode if she was not careful... Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh knew that this was because she lacked experience. However, at that moment, she remembered the teachings of the Party, and the glorious image of the heroic martyr Nguyen Van Troi appeared in her mind. The pineapple bombs in front of her also seemed to turn into American bandits who were brutally killing her compatriots. Thus, the raging fire of hatred made the blood in her whole body boil. She, this only twenty-one-year-old girl, calmed down and was filled with strength. She was determined to personally eliminate the "enemy" in front of her—the pineapple bombs—and contribute to the victory of the battle.
    Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh carefully held the pineapple bomb in one hand, her sharp eyes fixed on the "enemy," and with the other hand, using the screwdriver given to her by the comrade from the county unit, she boldly and skillfully pried open the top cover of the bomb and then removed the firing pin... The first "enemy" was subdued by her, and she gently placed it in a basket. Then, the second "enemy" was also taken down by her, and she placed it in the basket in the same way... In this way, with her and the other two comrades’ selfless efforts, all the "enemies" on the road were cleared. Her basket was filled with thirty-eight pineapple bombs.
    The young Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh felt as if she had won a battle, and her heart was filled with boundless joy. She wiped the sweat from her forehead, tidied her hair, and lightly carried the basket back to the factory. At this time, although it was already late at night, the militiamen in the factory were still summarizing and studying the battle experience of the day under the lights. When everyone saw Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh carrying so many pineapple bombs back so calmly, they all exclaimed in unison. From then on, a title full of praise for her: the girl who picks "pineapples," replaced Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh's name and spread.
    Fighting on the Position
    After the battle of July 27, the militiamen of the Shuaihai Brick Factory more intensively carried out military training activities. The higher-ups gave Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh a brand-new rifle, which she loved. Whether she was working or resting, she always carried the gun with her, and practiced shooting whenever she had time. On September 9, American bandit planes bombed the Shuaihai Reservoir again. On this day, as soon as Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh returned from out of town, she carried her gun in her hand and the ammunition box for the machine gun team on her shoulder, and ran quickly to the position. As soon as she went out, enemy planes roared in from 400 meters above. Regardless of the danger, she put down the ammunition box, raised her gun and shot at the enemy planes. After the enemy planes flew past, she quickly ran to the position. When the enemy planes turned back, she had already entered the position and started to shoot fiercely with everyone. That day, the scorching sun hung in the sky. The cunning enemy planes, taking advantage of the strong sunlight, constantly dived to drop bombs and strafe. In order to capture the enemy planes more accurately, Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh was designated as the observer of the battle team. She stood tall, her big eyes watching the sky without blinking, enduring the stinging rays of the sun. As soon as she spotted an enemy plane, she shouted: "Attention, enemy plane spotted in the sky, prepare, shoot!" The militiamen all said that on this day, she was just like a brave commander, directing everyone to fight.
    September 12 was the most intense day of the battle. From more than eight o'clock in the morning to more than five o'clock in the afternoon, enemy planes came to bomb and strafe a total of nine times. On this day, three enemy planes were shot down. On the morning of that day, just as the battle was in full swing, the higher-ups sent Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh and several other militiamen to search for the wreckage of the downed planes and the American pilots. This area was hilly, and there was often a stretch of open ground between the hills. At this time, leaving the position and moving in the open was a danger that could happen at any time. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh, like an agile ape, jumped forward and encouraged the other militiamen, guaranteeing that they would resolutely complete the task. The bombs dropped by the enemy planes exploded several times near them. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh's ears were buzzing, and the smoke and dust choked her, but she was not afraid. The only thing she thought about was: hurry up and find the plane wreckage and the American pilots. After more than three hours of searching, they finally completed the task. When Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh returned to the position panting, her whole body was soaked with sweat. How much she wanted to rest for a moment and wipe the sweat! However, the sinful enemy planes came again. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh angrily clenched her teeth, wiped the sweat from her forehead, picked up her gun and threw herself into the battle to punish the enemy.
    Because Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh fought bravely and her shooting skills improved quickly, she was transferred to the machine gun team as a machine gunner after this battle. In frequent battles, she has always been active on the position, using her machine gun to cooperate with the People's Army and other militia units to severely punish the American air bandits. Comrades from the county unit told us that after being tempered in battle, Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh has become an outstanding female militia model in the county. Not long ago, she was praised by the Third Military Region of the People's Army.
    Dedicate Youth to the Motherland
    Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh was originally a high school graduate from Hanoi, and her family is still in Hanoi. When we met her, she was wearing a black jacket, her face was dark from the sun, her physique was strong and healthy, her big eyes were bright and clear, and the "August 5th" medal pinned to her chest was shining. If the comrades present had not introduced her, it would have been hard to believe that she was a girl who grew up in a big city.
    Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh told us that after graduating from high school in 1963, she volunteered to work in the most difficult place. The organization then assigned her to work as a worker at the Wenmiao Brick Factory in Guangwei County. Burning tiles and bricks is not only hard work, but also dirty work. When she first came, some workers saw her urban girl's dress and saw how tired she was after working for a day, and concluded that she would not last a month and would run back to Hanoi. Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh was not discouraged by the workers' words. She was determined to be an ambitious young person, to train and transform herself in labor. A month passed, and Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh learned the complete set of tile and brick burning techniques, and the more she worked, the happier she became. Gradually, the workers changed their opinion of her, and at the same time, their care and concern for her became more meticulous. Later, the organization trained her to be an accountant. When the Wenmiao Brick Factory established a branch factory in Shuaihai, a remote semi-mountainous area, she volunteered to work in this relatively difficult place.
    The heinous act of American imperialism wantonly dispatching planes to bomb peaceful towns and villages in North Vietnam aroused her great anger. She actively participated in militia training activities. In those days, the Youth League branch organized everyone to study the heroic deeds of martyr Nguyen Van Troi. Nguyen Van Troi's majestic words before his慷慨就义gave her a profound education. She repeatedly read the book "Live Like Him." At Youth League meetings and in letters to her family, she expressed her determination to take Nguyen Van Troi as an example, respond to Uncle Ho's call, be a young person who is "loyal to the Party and filial to the people," and dedicate all her youth to the motherland.
    In the many battles to defend the Shuaihai Reservoir, she fought against American air bandits with this determination. Not only that, in the very tense and intense battle life, she also completed the accounting work she was responsible for well. Every time the American bandit planes were driven away, she would sort out the accounts of the day under the lights, working until late at night. Sometimes she would bring the accounts to the position and work whenever there was a gap. When the alarm sounded, she would hide the accounts and immediately throw herself into battle.
    Our conversation with Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh continued until late at night. After she left, Comrade Feng Wen'an, the county party secretary who was present, said to us with infinite emotion and unusual determination: "American imperialism thinks that their bombs can threaten us, but how can they think that the bombs have educated the Vietnamese people and youth. Young people like Nguyen Thi Minh Thanh are just one of the thousands upon thousands of model figures among us. If American imperialism deliberately expands the war, the Vietnamese people will inevitably further mobilize and use a powerful people's war to defeat it." (Attached picture)

    挑“菠萝”的姑娘
    胡本英
    称号的来历
    在越南北方河西省广威县，我们会见一个勇敢的女民兵模范，大家都叫她挑“菠萝”的姑娘。乍一听，我们以为这个姑娘是农业社社员，因为挑菠萝而出了名。其实，她是砖瓦厂的女会计，她挑的“菠萝”也并非人们通常吃的菠萝，而是美国强盗扔下的炸弹。那么，她那挑“菠萝”的姑娘的称号是怎样来的呢？
    事情是这样的：
    去年七月二十七日下午，一批美国强盗飞机第一次轰炸河西帅海水库。当时，帅海砖瓦厂女会计、民兵队员阮氏明清，正因公在山西市出差，她一听到美国强盗行凶的消息，心头顿时燃烧起愤怒的火焰，急忙骑上自行车就往厂里奔。她要赶回去同大家一起战斗，痛击美国强盗。但当她回到厂里时，天色已经昏暗下来，敌机被击落五架，其余仓皇逃遁了。阮氏明清对自己没能参加这次战斗深深惋惜。这时，县队部的一位同志正在厂里教民兵们拆卸菠萝弹（美国的一种小型杀伤弹，黄色，大小象菠萝，故名）她马上参加了学习，随后，县队部同志要两个民兵同她一起到水库清除美国强盗当天扔下的菠萝弹，并说明这项工作是很危险的，要非常勇敢才行。阮氏明清心想：她没能亲手打击美国飞机，再也不能错过这次清除美国炸弹的机会，所以坚决要求让她去，表示一定经受住考验。领导上同意了她的请求。她连晚饭也顾不上吃，就提着个小油灯，同另外两个同志出发了。
    阮氏明清来到水库跟前，在微弱的油灯照射下，看见一颗颗未爆炸的菠萝弹，横七竖八地散布在水坝下面的公路上。公路两头一辆辆为战斗服务的汽车，由于菠萝弹的阻碍，而不能通行。“战斗是多么需要弹药供应啊！”阮氏明清想到这里，恨不得马上把这些菠萝弹一扫而光。可是，当她拿起第一颗菠萝弹时，心里却扑通扑通直跳，手也有些发颤，生怕万一不小心炸弹爆炸……。阮氏明清明白这是自己缺乏锻炼的缘故。然而，就在这一刹那，她记起了党的教导，脑海中浮现出阮文追烈士英勇不屈的光辉形象，眼前的菠萝弹也仿佛变成一个个残杀自己同胞的美国强盗。于是，仇恨的怒火使她浑身血液沸腾。她，这个只有二十一岁的姑娘，镇定下来，全身充满了力量，她决心亲手消灭眼前的“敌人”——菠萝弹，为战斗胜利贡献一份力量。
    阮氏明清一只手小心地托着菠萝弹，锐利的双目紧紧地盯着“敌人”，另一只手用县部队同志送给她的螺丝刀，大胆而灵巧地撬开弹的顶盖，然后卸下弹上的撞针……，第一个“敌人”被她制服了，她轻轻地把它放在筐篮里。接着，第二个“敌人”又被她撂倒了，她照样把它放在筐篮里……。就这样，在她和另外两个同志奋不顾身的努力下，公路上的“敌人”全被肃清了。她的筐篮里整整装满了三十八个菠萝弹。
    年轻的阮氏明清象打过一场胜仗似的，心头洋溢着无限喜悦，她揩了揩额角上的汗水，整理了一下头发，轻悠悠地挑着筐篮回到厂里。这时，虽然已经深更半夜了，但厂里民兵们还在灯光下总结和研究当天的战斗经验。当大家看到阮氏明清这样镇静地挑回那么多菠萝弹的时候，都不约而同地惊呼起来。从此，一个饱含着赞扬她的称号：挑“菠萝”的姑娘，就代替阮氏明清的名字而传开了。
    战斗在阵地上
    经过七月二十七日的战斗，帅海砖瓦厂的民兵们更加紧张地开展了练武活动。上级发给阮氏明清一支崭新的步枪，她爱不释手，不论上班或休息，随时都带着枪，一有空就练习射击。九月九日，美国强盗飞机再次轰炸帅海水库。这天上午，阮氏明清从外地一回来，就手提着枪，肩上扛着给机枪组的子弹箱，飞快地往阵地上跑。她刚出门，敌机便从四百米上空呼啸而来，她不顾危险，放下子弹箱，举枪就对着敌机射击。敌机飞过去了，她急速跑向阵地，等到敌机转回来的时候，她已进入阵地，同大家一起猛烈地射击起来。当天，烈日悬空，狡猾的敌机借着强烈的阳光，不断俯冲投弹和扫射。为了更准确地捕捉敌机，阮氏明清被指定为战斗组的观察员。她昂立着身子，两只大眼睛，顶着阳光的刺射，眨也不眨地监视着天空，一发现敌机，她就高呼：“注意，上空发现敌机，准备，射击！”民兵们都说，这一天，她简直象一个勇敢的指挥员，在指挥大家战斗。
    九月十二日是战斗最激烈的一天。从上午八点多钟，到下午五点多，敌机共九次飞来轰炸、扫射。这一天，敌机被击落三架。当天上午，正当战斗激烈进行的时候，上级派阮氏明清和另外几个民兵去寻找被击落的飞机残骸和美国飞行员。这一带地方丘陵起伏，山丘之间，往往相距一段开阔地。这时，离开阵地在开阔地移动，是随时都可能发生危险的。阮氏明清一面象只机灵的猿猴似的跳蹦着前进，一面同其他民兵互相鼓励，保证坚决完成任务。敌机扔下的炸弹，有几次就在他们附近爆炸，阮氏明清的耳朵被震得嗡嗡鸣叫，硝烟和弥漫的尘土使她发呛，但她没有畏惧。她心中想到的只有一件事：赶快找到飞机残骸和美国飞行员。经过三个多钟头的寻找，他们终于完成了任务。当阮氏明清气喘吁吁地回到阵地的时候，汗水已把她全身湿透了。这时她是多么想休息片刻，擦擦汗水啊！可是，罪恶的敌机又来了。阮氏明清愤怒地把牙关一咬，顺手抹掉额上的汗珠，举起枪又投入了惩罚敌人的战斗。
    由于阮氏明清作战勇敢，射击技术提高得快，这次战斗以后，她被调到机枪组，当了机枪射手。在频繁的战斗中，她始终活跃在阵地上，用她的机枪，配合人民军和其他民兵单位，痛击美国空中强盗。县部队的同志告诉我们，经过战斗的锻炼，阮氏明清已成了县里出色的女民兵模范，不久前，她受到人民军第三军区的表扬。
    把青春献给祖国
    阮氏明清原是河内市的一个中学毕业生，家现在仍在河内。我们会见她的时候，她上身穿着黑色夹袄，面孔晒得黧黑，体格结实健壮，两只大眼睛，机灵清秀，胸前别着的“八·五”奖章闪闪发光。如果不是在场的同志介绍，使人很难相信她竟是在大城市里长大的姑娘。
    阮氏明清告诉我们，一九六三年她读完高中后，志愿到最艰苦的地方工作。组织上便分配她来到广威县文庙砖瓦厂当工人。烧瓦烧砖不仅是一桩苦活，而且是一桩脏活。刚来的时候，有的工人看到她那种城市姑娘的打扮，看到她劳动一天后累得那个样子，断定她过不了一个月，就会跑回河内去。阮氏明清听了工人的话，并不灰心，她决心要做一个有志气的青年，在劳动中锻炼、改造自己。一个月过去了，阮氏明清学会了全套烧瓦烧砖技术，而且越干越欢。渐渐地，工人们改变了对她的看法，同时对她的照顾、关怀也更加无微不至了。后来，组织上培养她作了会计。文庙砖瓦厂在偏僻的半山区帅海成立分厂时，她又志愿要求到这个比较艰苦的地方工作。
    美帝国主义悍然出动飞机轰炸越南北方和平城乡的罪恶行为，激起了她的极大愤怒。她积极参加了民兵的训练活动。在那些日子里，团支部组织大家学习了阮文追烈士的英雄事迹。阮文追慷慨就义前所说的气壮山河的话，给了她深刻的教育。她曾反复地阅读了《象他那样生活》这本书，在团的会上，在给家里的信中，她都表示要以阮文追为榜样，响应胡伯伯的号召，做一个“忠于党、孝于民”的青年，把全部青春献给祖国。
    在保卫帅海水库的多次战斗中，她就是抱着这种决心打击美国空中强盗的。不仅如此，在战斗生活十分紧张、激烈的情况下，她担任的会计工作也都良好地完成了。每次美国强盗飞机被赶跑以后，她就在灯光下整理当天的账目，一直工作到深夜。有时她还把账目带到阵地上，一有空隙就进行工作，警报钟响了，她便把账目藏好，立即投入战斗。
    我们同阮氏明清的谈话继续到深夜。当她离开以后，在场的县委书记冯文安同志无限感慨而又异常坚定地对我们说：“美帝国主义以为它们的炸弹就可以威胁我们，但它们怎会想到，炸弹教育了越南人民和青年。象阮氏明清这样的青年，仅仅是我们千千万万个模范人物当中的一个。如果美帝国主义蓄意扩大战争，越南人民就必然进一步动员起来，用强大的人民战争来打败它。”（附图片）
