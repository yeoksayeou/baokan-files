    Currently, the vast number of cadres and the masses are studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student. What should leading cadres at all levels focus on learning? The article by Comrade Li Benshan, Secretary of the Xigaze Prefectural Party Committee, and others, puts forward a very good opinion: In order to better revolutionize for the rest of our lives, we should study Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of thorough revolution and the working method of thoroughly following the mass line.
    Generally speaking, leading cadres at all levels have participated in the revolution for a relatively long time and have relatively rich work experience after being tempered in various revolutionary struggles. Correctly treating all of this, carrying forward the advantages, and overcoming the shortcomings can make them a foundation for adhering to the revolution and serving the Party and the people better. If one lacks awareness of them and falls into blindness, all of this may become a burden, hindering one from moving forward lightly. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Examining the burden on one's back, putting it down, and liberating one's spirit is indeed one of the necessary prerequisites for contacting the masses and making fewer mistakes." We should firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching, enhance awareness, and overcome blindness.
    Completely and thoroughly for the revolution, for the people—have leading cadres at all levels completely solved this issue of world outlook? Some comrades use Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit and excellent qualities to measure themselves and discover that their world outlook and their standpoint cannot be considered completely resolved. In fact, there are still such and such gaps between them and him. It is very right to study Comrade Jiao Yulu in this spirit of rectification.
    The revolution is constantly developing, and the situation is constantly changing. The responsibilities of leading cadres at all levels are becoming heavier and heavier, and the new problems they face are becoming more and more numerous. This requires them to constantly strengthen their Party spirit, constantly improve their awareness, constantly cultivate the communist spirit, and constantly overcome individualistic distractions to adapt to the needs of the new situation and new circumstances. Leading cadres at all levels lead the masses in carrying out the three great revolutionary movements and, at the same time, are tested in the three great revolutionary movements, especially in the class struggle. Revolution is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will retreat. Personal transformation is also like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will retreat. From this point of view, the solution of the world outlook cannot be achieved once and for all. A revolutionary, if he has carried out serious ideological remolding in the first half of his life, has only created good conditions for ideological remolding in the second half of his life, but can never be used as a guarantee that he can not carry out ideological remolding in the second half of his life. The correct attitude is, as some comrades said: "Live and learn, remold and revolutionize, until old age."
    Some leading cadres pay close attention to studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's working methods. We believe that methodology and world outlook are unified. Revolutionary working methods can only be mastered and used by revolutionaries. Comrade Jiao Yulu's investigation and research work was so good, his relationship with the masses was so close, and he was such an excellent "squad leader," first of all because he established a firm communist world outlook, had a high sense of responsibility for the cause of the Party and the people, had deep class feelings for the masses of the people, and had only the interests of the Party and the people in his heart, without individualistic distractions. To learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's working methods of the mass line, we must first learn his communist world outlook. With the determination to serve the people thoroughly, we can gradually find ways to serve the people thoroughly in practice.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's communist world outlook comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. The most fundamental point for leading cadres at all levels to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu should be to learn from him how to painstakingly and diligently study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a living way, and to work hard on the word "application." Leading cadres generally receive more education from the Party and read more of Comrade Mao Zedong's books. This is a fact. However, some comrades have a misconception about this situation, thinking that they have learned almost enough and have been transformed almost enough.
    This kind of thinking is terrible. It may make us stagnate and be complacent. A leading cadre, if he demands of himself to a high standard, will realize that the longer the revolutionary history and the heavier the burden, the greater his responsibility. If he makes mistakes on certain key issues, he may have a global impact on the areas and departments he leads, causing great losses to the Party and the people. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels should study better than the masses and better than general cadres, be more strict with themselves, and more consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and eliminate individual distractions. We must study until old age and carry out ideological remolding until old age. In the process of transforming the objective world, we must constantly transform our subjective world and transform the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world. The more leading cadres there are, the more they must have such a high degree of awareness.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Even those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and a relatively firm proletarian stand must still learn, accept new things, and study new problems." Those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought must study again. Then, what should those who have a relatively poor understanding of Marxism do? Only by working harder to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, always acting as promoters of the revolution, and being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong.

### 思想改造永无止境

    思想改造永无止境
    目前，广大干部、群众都在学习毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹。各级领导干部，应该着重学习什么呢？日喀则地委书记李本善等同志的文章，提出了很好的意见：为了后半辈子更好的革命，学习焦裕禄同志的彻底革命精神和彻底走群众路线的工作方法。
    各级领导干部，一般说来，参加革命的时间比较长，经过各种革命斗争的锻炼，有比较丰富的工作经验。正确地对待这一切，发扬优点、克服缺点，就可以把它们作为坚持革命，更好地为党、为人民服务的基础。如果对它们缺乏自觉性，陷入盲目性，这一切就可能成为自己的包袱，妨碍自己轻装前进。毛泽东同志说：“检查自己背上的包袱，把它放下来，使自己的精神获得解放，实在是联系群众和少犯错误的必要前提之一。”我们应当牢牢记住毛泽东同志的这个教导，提高自觉性，克服盲目性。
    完全彻底地为革命、为人民——各级领导干部是不是完全解决了这个世界观的问题呢？有些同志用焦裕禄同志的革命精神和优秀品质衡量自己，发现自己的世界观问题，自己的立场问题，不能认为已经完全解决了，实际上同他还有这样那样的差距。这样用整风精神学习焦裕禄同志，是很对的。
    革命不断发展，情况不断变化。各级领导干部的责任越来越重，面对的新问题越来越多。这就要求他们不断增强党性，不断提高觉悟，要求他们不断培养共产主义精神，不断克服个人主义杂念，以适应新形势、新情况的需要。各级领导干部领导群众进行三大革命运动，同时在三大革命运动中经受考验，特别是在阶级斗争中经受考验。革命如逆水行舟，不进则退；个人的改造也如逆水行舟，不进则退。从这个意义来说，世界观的解决是不能一劳永逸的。一个革命者，如果前半辈子进行了认真的思想改造，这只是给后半辈子的思想改造创造了良好的条件，而绝不能作为后半辈子可以不进行思想改造的保票。正确的态度是象有的同志所说的：“活到老，学到老，改造到老，革命到老。”
    有些领导干部很注意学习焦裕禄同志的工作方法。我们认为，方法论和世界观是统一的。革命的工作方法，只有革命者才能掌握和运用。焦裕禄同志调查研究工作那么好，同群众的关系那么密切，“班长”当得那么出色，首先是因为他树立了坚定的共产主义世界观，对党和人民的事业具有高度的责任感，对人民群众怀有深厚的阶级感情，心里只有党和人民的利益，没有个人主义杂念。要学习焦裕禄同志的群众路线的工作方法，首先要学习他的共产主义世界观。有了彻底为人民的决心，就能够在实践中逐步找到彻底为人民的方法。
    焦裕禄同志的共产主义世界观，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。各级领导干部学习焦裕禄同志，最根本的一点，应该是学习他刻苦地勤奋地活学活用毛泽东同志著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。领导干部受党的教育比较多，读毛泽东同志的书一般也比较多。这是事实。可是，有些同志对这种情况发生了错觉，认为自己已经学得差不多了，改造得差不多了。
    这种想法是可怕的。它可能使得我们停滞不前，故步自封。一个领导干部，如果用高标准要求自己，就会认识到革命历史越长，担子越重，自己的责任也就越大，如果在某些关键问题上作了错事，就可能在自己领导的地区和部门发生全局性的影响，为党为人民造成大损失。因此，各级领导干部应该比群众学得好，比一般干部学得好，更加严于责己，更自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己，去掉个人杂念。我们要作到老，学到老，进行思想改造到老。要在改造客观世界的过程中，不断改造自己的主观世界，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。越是领导干部，越要有这样高的自觉性。
    毛泽东同志说：“即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想了解得比较多的人，都要再学习，那末，对马克思主义了解得比较少的人，该怎么办呢？只有更加努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，永作革命的促进派，当一个毛泽东同志的好学生。
