    Kenyan Authorities Intend to Lead Sino-Kenyan Relations?
    By Our Correspondent
    Recently, imperialism and old and new colonialism are frantically counterattacking the African people, stirring up trouble everywhere in a vain attempt to obstruct the progress of African history. It is in this context that the Kenyan Senate passed a motion on March 1 aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China. This move by the Kenyan Senate cannot but attract people's attention.
    The Chinese government has always respected the sovereignty of African countries and never interfered in their internal affairs. The Chinese government has consistently adhered to the Five Principles in its relations with African countries and firmly supports the struggle of African countries against imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence. China's position is open and aboveboard. Of course, to oppose China, one must find an excuse. Some people in Kenya have seized on Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks about the "excellent situation of the African revolution" during his visit to Africa and made a big fuss, launching unwarranted attacks on China.
    As everyone knows, Premier Zhou Enlai's "excellent situation of the African revolution" refers to the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial national revolution of the African people. The awakened people of African countries demand the complete destruction of colonial rule, the complete elimination of colonial forces, and resolutely oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, carrying the national democratic revolution through to the end. Premier Zhou Enlai's conclusion about the African situation fully conforms to the reality of Africa. However, some people in Kenya have wantonly distorted Premier Zhou Enlai's words and forcibly linked the military coups that have occurred in some African countries with Premier Zhou Enlai's speech. But, as everyone knows, imperialism, headed by the United States, is launching a frantic counterattack against independent African countries. The series of reactionary military coups that have recently occurred in sub-Saharan Africa have mostly been instigated by imperialism and old and new colonialism. The Kenyan authorities' attempt to attribute all these imperialist deeds to China is both absurd and ridiculous.
    The friendship between the Chinese people and the Kenyan people and the people of African countries is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. Imperialism and old and new colonialism, headed by the United States, regard this as a huge obstacle to their pursuit of colonial policies. They are frantically inciting anti-China sentiment in African countries, sowing discord and attempting to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the African people. Imperialism was the first to launch attacks on Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks about the "excellent situation of the African revolution." Now, the Kenyan Senate is harping on this old tune and even formally passing a motion slandering China. What exactly does this mean? Whose needs does it serve?
    The Chinese people and the Kenyan people have a deep friendship. The Chinese government has made unremitting efforts to promote friendly cooperation between China and Kenya. However, maintaining and developing Sino-Kenyan friendship depends on the joint efforts of the two governments. The anti-China motion passed by the Kenyan Senate cannot but be regarded as a serious step taken by the Kenyan side to deliberately deteriorate and undermine the normal relations between China and Kenya. We hope that the Kenyan government will attach importance to the friendship between the two countries and take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Otherwise, as pointed out in our note to Kenya, "the Kenyan government shall be fully responsible for all the consequences arising from this motion."

    肯尼亚当局要把中肯关系引向何处？
    本报评论员
    最近，帝国主义和新老殖民主义，正对非洲人民进行猖狂反扑，到处兴风作浪，妄图阻挡非洲历史的前进。正是在这种情况下，肯尼亚参议院在三月一日通过了一个旨在反对中华人民共和国的动议。肯尼亚参议院的这一动向，不能不引起人们的注意。
    中国政府一向尊重非洲国家的主权，从不干涉他国内政。中国政府一贯坚持对非洲国家的五项原则，坚决支持非洲国家反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争。中国的立场，是光明磊落的。当然，既然要反华，总得找个借口。肯尼亚的某些人就抓住了周恩来总理访非时谈到的“非洲革命大好形势”这句话大作文章，对中国进行无端的攻击。
    人所共知，周恩来总理讲的“非洲革命大好形势”，是指非洲人民反帝反殖民族革命而言。觉醒了的非洲各国人民要求彻底摧毁殖民统治，彻底肃清殖民势力，坚决反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，要把民族民主革命进行到底。周恩来总理对非洲形势所作的结论，完全符合非洲的现实。然而，肯尼亚的某一些人，却对周恩来总理的这句话肆意进行歪曲，并且硬把一些非洲国家发生的军事政变同周恩来总理的讲话扯在一起。但是，谁都知道，以美国为首的帝国主义，正在对非洲独立国家进行猖狂的反扑。最近在撒哈拉以南的非洲所发生的一系列反动军事政变，大多是帝国主义和新老殖民主义所策动的。肯尼亚当局企图把所有这些帝国主义干的勾当，推到中国的头上，这是既荒唐，又可笑的。
    中国人民同肯尼亚人民和非洲各国人民的友谊，日益巩固和发展。以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，把这看作它们推行殖民主义政策的巨大障碍。它们猖狂地煽动非洲国家反华，它们挑拨离间，企图破坏中国人民和非洲人民的友好关系。对周恩来总理讲的“非洲革命大好形势”这句话，首先发起攻击的，是帝国主义。现在，肯尼亚参议院重弹这种老调，甚至正式通过诬蔑中国的动议，这究竟是什么意思呢？这是适应谁的需要呢？
    中国人民和肯尼亚人民有着深厚的友谊。中国政府为促进中、肯两国的友好合作，做了不懈的努力。但是，维护和发展中、肯友谊，有赖于两国政府的共同努力。肯尼亚参议院通过的反华动议，不能不被认为是肯尼亚方面蓄意恶化和破坏中、肯两国正常关系的一个严重步骤。我们希望肯尼亚政府以两国友谊为重，切实采取措施，制止类似事件的再次发生。否则，正如我国致肯尼亚照会所指出的，“由此动议而引起的一切后果，肯尼亚政府应负完全责任。”
