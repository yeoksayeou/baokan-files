    The PLA literary and sports workers organized a large number of various types of cultural work teams, going deep into the companies to serve the majority, to serve the grassroots construction, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters.
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, the literary and sports workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implementing the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, have organized more than 100 various types of cultural work teams since last year, going deep into the companies to serve the majority, to serve the grassroots construction, and have been warmly welcomed by the commanders and fighters. The commanders and fighters praised them as propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, seeding teams of revolutionary literature and art, and red service teams.
    The broad masses of literary and art workers participating in the cultural work teams have deeply realized from the practice of the past year that organizing cultural work teams is a good way to serve the soldiers most broadly, an important method for leading organs to go deep into the grassroots to guide cultural work, a good way to promote the cultural work of the troops to grasp living ideas and reflect the real struggle life, and also a revolutionary school for training red literary and art successors and an important way to improve literary and art creation. The cultural departments and literary and sports teams at all levels of the army are determined to organize more cultural work teams to go deep into the grassroots this year to better serve the soldiers and serve the elimination of bourgeois ideology, consolidation and improvement of the combat effectiveness of the troops.
    These cultural work teams organized by the various PLA units last year consisted of more than thirty people, and as few as ten people. They wholeheartedly served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, going wherever there was the greatest need and wherever it was most difficult; wherever they went, they publicized Mao Zedong Thought. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, fought, trained, and labored together, and enthusiastically performed good programs for the soldiers that were combined with the central tasks of the troops and reflected the real struggle life of the troops. The Guangzhou Military Region's Maritime Cultural Work Team traveled almost all over the various islands of the Wanshan Archipelago in the Pearl River Estuary and many islands in the South China Sea in the eight months from March to November last year, and wherever they went was a stage. The performed programs were closely integrated with the real struggle life of the troops. The quick-rhythm talk "Piercing the Paper Tiger" and the poetry recitation "Letters from the South" aroused the soldiers' deep hatred for American imperialism. The soldiers often interrupted the actors' performances and raised their arms and shouted "Down with American imperialism!" The Cultural Work Team of the Tibet Military Region carried their own props, crossed mountains and forests, climbed cliffs, and walked along precipices, touring border defense stations, supply stations, and telephone maintenance posts, using the blue sky as a curtain, the hillside as a stage, and the snowy mountains and grasslands as a backdrop, performing for the soldiers and local masses. Once, the Cultural Work Team went to perform for a certain border defense troop and had to cross a large snow mountain more than 5,000 meters above sea level on the way. The mountain was covered with wind and snow, and some places had more than one meter of snow. Because of the high altitude and lack of oxygen, the actors had to expend a lot of effort to move each step, and there was always the danger of falling into a snow nest. But they were fearless, holding hands, climbing to the top of the mountain step by step, and then sliding down the snow trough to the foot of the mountain, and marched hard in the snow for eleven hours before reaching the troops. At this time, even though it was late at night, they still performed for the soldiers regardless of fatigue, using the moon as a lamp. The soldiers excitedly praised: Not only did they bring us good plays, but they also brought us revolutionary spirit. When many cultural work teams performed at the grassroots level, they also wrote programs under the slogan of "writing good deeds of the company, performing good deeds of the company," and whether they had done creative work or not, they all picked up their pens to write programs, and through the compilation and performance of the living people and living events of the company, they vividly and vividly publicized Mao Zedong Thought, making literature and art truly a powerful tool for grasping living ideas. When the Navy's small performance team performed for a certain air force unit, they caught up with the combat hero Shu Jicheng shooting down an enemy plane. They immediately collected materials and compiled programs such as Shandong Qinshu "Shu Jicheng Annihilates Enemy Planes" overnight, and performed at the celebration meeting the next day.
    While performing for the troops, many cultural work teams also adopted various methods to train various types of cultural and sports backbones for the units they visited, and assisted the companies in carrying out amateur literary, artistic, and sports activities. During the four months or more of the activities of the Cultural Work Team of the Shenyang Military Region in the troops, in addition to individual counseling, they also ran nine training classes for storytelling, folk art, performing, directing, creation, sight-reading, erhu, flute, and slides. Every time they went to a place, they also held cultural work symposiums to publicize Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on literary and artistic work in the troops, listened to the opinions of the company cadres and soldiers on literary and sports activities, and introduced them to the experience of literary and sports activities. Some learned from each other and improved together by cooperating with soldiers in writing programs or performing on the same stage. Many other cultural work teams did a lot of service work for the soldiers during their in-depth visits to the companies. When the Fuzhou Military Region's Cultural Work Team went to perform on the front-line islands, each person carried more than 50 kilograms of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary books to the commanders and fighters stationed on the islands for a long time. The soldiers held the books and said gratefully: This is the most precious gift brought to us.
    The members of the cultural work teams, in serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, were closer to the ideological feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more consciously established the idea of performing for the revolution and working for the revolution, and their political consciousness was greatly improved. Many people said: The more contact with the soldiers, the faster the ideological transformation. Many people, starting from the needs of the revolution, jumped out of their professional circles and strived to master "one specialty with multiple skills," so as to achieve "one soldier with multiple uses." They said: Whatever member, whatever member, are all propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and servants of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    做毛泽东思想的宣传员  做工农兵群众的勤务员
    解放军文艺体育工作者组成大批各种类型文化工作队，深入连队为大多数人服务，为基层建设服务，受到广大指战员的热烈欢迎
    据新华社五日讯　中国人民解放军文艺体育工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方向，去年以来，先后组织一百多个各种类型的文化工作队，深入连队，为大多数人服务，为基层建设服务，受到指战员的热烈欢迎。指战员们称赞他们是毛泽东思想的宣传队，革命文艺的播种队，红色的服务队。
    参加文化工作队的广大文艺工作者从一年来的实践中深刻体会到，组织文化工作队是最广泛地为兵服务的一种好形式，是领导机关深入基层指导文化工作的重要方法，是促进部队文化工作抓活思想、反映现实斗争生活的一种好形式，也是造就红色文艺接班人的革命学校，提高文艺创作的重要途径。全军各级文化部门和文艺体育队伍，决心在今年组织更多的文化工作队深入基层，更好地为兵服务，为兴无灭资、巩固和提高部队战斗力服务。
    去年解放军各部队组织的这些文化工作队，多的三十多人，少的只有十来个人。他们全心全意为工农兵服务，那里最需要、那里最艰苦，就到那里去；走到那里，就把毛主席思想宣传到那里。他们同战士一起学习毛主席著作，一起战斗、训练、劳动，满腔热情为战士演出结合部队中心任务、反映部队现实斗争生活的好节目。广州部队海上文化工作队，在去年三月到十一月的八个多月里，几乎走遍了珠江口的万山群岛各岛和南海的许多岛屿，走到那里那里是舞台。演出的节目，紧密地结合部队现实斗争生活。快板书《戳穿纸老虎》、诗朗诵《南方来信》等节目，激起了战士们对美帝国主义的深仇大恨，战士们常常打断演员的表演，振臂高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”西藏军区文化工作队，自己背上道具翻山穿林，攀悬岩，走绝壁，巡回在边防站、兵站和电话维护哨，以蓝天为幕，山坡作舞台，雪山草原当布景，为战士和当地群众演出。有一次，文化工作队到某边防部队演出，途中要翻过一座拔海五千多米的大雪山。山上风雪弥漫，有的地方积雪一米多厚。因为山高缺氧，演员们每挪动一步都要付出很大力气，还随时有掉进雪窝的危险。但他们无所畏惧，手拉着手，一步一步爬上山顶，又顺着雪槽滑到山脚，整整在雪地艰苦行进了十一个小时才到达部队。这时，尽管已是深夜，他们仍然不顾疲劳，以月亮作灯，给战士举行演出。战士们激动地赞扬说：不但给我们送来了好戏，更给我们送来了革命精神。许多文化工作队在基层演出时，还在“写连队好人好事、演连队好人好事”的口号下，不论搞过创作的还是没有搞过创作的都拿起笔来编写节目，通过编演连队的活人活事，形象地、生动地宣传了毛泽东思想，使文艺真正成为抓活思想的有力工具。海军的小型演出队，在某航空兵部队演出时，正赶上战斗英雄舒积成击落敌机，当即收集材料，一夜之间编出山东琴书《舒积成痛歼敌机》等节目，在第二天参加庆功大会时演出。
    许多文化工作队在为部队演出的同时，还采取各种方式，给所到单位培训各种各样的文体骨干，辅导连队开展业余文艺、体育活动。沈阳部队文化工作队，在部队活动的四个多月期间，除个别辅导外，分别开办了故事、曲艺、表演、导演、创作、识谱、胡琴、笛子、幻灯等九种训练班，他们每到一处，还召开文化工作座谈会，宣讲毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和林彪同志对部队文艺工作的指示，听取连队干部战士对文艺体育活动的意见，向他们介绍文艺体育活动的经验。有的通过同战士合作编写节目，或同台演出，相互学习，共同提高。还有许多文化工作队，在深入连队期间，给战士们做了大量的服务性工作。福州部队文化工作队到前沿海岛演出时，每人背了毛主席著作和革命书籍五十多斤，给长驻在海岛的指战员们。战士们捧着书感激地说：这是给我们送来了最珍贵的礼物。
    文化工作队员们，在为工农兵服务，与工农兵结合中，和工农兵的思想感情更接近了，更加自觉地树立起为革命而演戏、为革命而工作的思想，政治觉悟大为提高，很多人说：和战士接触多一点，思想改造快一点，很多人从革命需要出发，跳出了自己专业的圈圈，努力掌握“一专多能”，做到“一兵多用”。他们说：什么这个员那个员，都是毛泽东思想宣传员，工农兵的勤务员。
