    According to a Hsinhua News Agency dispatch from Pyongyang on the 23rd: Newspapers here reported on the 23rd that the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland, and the Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland jointly issued an appeal on the 22nd. The appeal exposed the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Park Chung-hee clique, for their continued conspiracy to send more South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam. The appeal called on all the people of South Korea to rise up and smash the enemy's criminal activities of sending troops to South Vietnam, and to launch a resolute struggle to drive the U.S. aggressors out of South Korea, overthrow the Park Chung-hee traitorous group, and realize the independent reunification of the fatherland.

    The appeal said that the Park Chung-hee clique, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, has dispatched a large number of South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam, once again clearly exposing the bandit nature of U.S. imperialism and revealing the true face of the Park Chung-hee clique, who only follow the orders of the United States and betray the country and the nation.

    The appeal said that the people of Korea and Vietnam are both suffering from the aggression of U.S. imperialism and are brothers and comrades-in-arms against U.S. imperialism. The people of South Korea must never stand on the side of the aggressors, never stand on the side of the traitors, never stand on the side of the criminals, and must never allow South Korean youth to be dragged to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism. A vigorous struggle to save the country must be launched to smash the enemy's activities of sending more puppet troops to South Vietnam, and to demand the immediate recall of puppet troops already sent to South Vietnam.

    The appeal emphasized that the struggle against sending South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam is also a struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and a struggle against U.S. imperialism's colonial rule over South Korea.

    The appeal called on South Korean workers, peasants, youth, and students to stand at the forefront of this struggle. It called on all officers and soldiers of the South Korean puppet army to resolutely refuse to be sent to South Vietnam, and they must turn their guns against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The appeal called on the South Korean puppet army already sent to South Vietnam to immediately stop all criminal acts against the Vietnamese people, surrender to the South Vietnam Liberation Army, and strive to return to their hometowns as soon as possible.

    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会等发表号召书
    号召南朝鲜人民反对朴正熙集团增兵南越
    据新华社平壤二十三日电　据这里报纸二十三日报道，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会、祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会和祖国和平统一委员会二十二日联合发表号召书，揭露美帝国主义及其走狗朴正熙集团继续向南越增派南朝鲜傀儡军的阴谋活动，号召南朝鲜全体人民奋起粉碎敌人向南越派兵的罪恶活动，并且展开坚决斗争，把美国侵略者赶出南朝鲜，打倒朴正熙卖国集团和实现祖国的自主统一。
    号召书说，朴正熙集团在美帝国主义的指使下把大批南朝鲜傀儡军派往南越，再一次清楚地暴露出美帝国主义的强盗本性，暴露出唯美国之命是听的朴正熙集团出卖国家和民族的真面目。
    号召书说，朝鲜和越南两国人民同样遭受美帝国主义的侵略，是反对美帝国主义的兄弟和战友，南朝鲜人民绝不能够站在侵略者一边，绝不能够站在卖国贼一边，绝不能够站在犯罪者一边，绝不能允许把南朝鲜青年拉到南越替美帝国主义当炮灰，必须展开有力的救国斗争，粉碎敌人的向南越增派傀儡军的活动，并且要求立即召回已经派往南越的傀儡军。
    号召书强调指出，反对把南朝鲜傀儡军派往南越的斗争，也就是反对美帝国主义侵略越南的斗争，也就是反对美帝国主义对南朝鲜进行殖民统治的斗争。
    号召书号召南朝鲜工人、农民、青年和学生应该站在这一斗争的最前列，号召南朝鲜傀儡军全体官兵应该断然拒绝被派往南越，而且必须掉转枪口，对准美帝国主义及其走狗。号召书号召已经被派往南越的南朝鲜傀儡军应该立即停止反对越南人民的一切犯罪行为，向越南南方解放军投诚，争取早日返回故乡。
