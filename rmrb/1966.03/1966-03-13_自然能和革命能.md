　　When I was in school, I read about "energy" in physics textbooks. Things like mechanical energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, atomic energy, and so on. All these energies are called "natural energy."
　　The application of "natural energy" is extremely broad. In our human life, eating, using, living, and transportation, none of these can be separated from it. "Natural energy" is also extremely powerful, especially atomic energy, which is a type of energy with immense power. When one kilogram of uranium undergoes complete fission, the atomic energy produced is equivalent to the energy released by burning two thousand five hundred tons of high-quality coal!
　　In the dozen years since liberation, I have increasingly realized that in this world, besides this "natural energy," there is another most important "energy." This "energy" is none other than the "revolutionary energy" of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
　　This "energy" is the enthusiasm and drive that 650 million people have burst forth with in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is the energy produced by thousands upon thousands of spiritual atomic bombs. It is incredibly powerful, capable of overturning mountains and seas, changing the heavens and the earth. No difficulty can stop it, and any miracle can be created. It absolutely cannot be expressed by the units of measurement for "natural energy."
　　This "revolutionary energy" of the 650 million people is an inexhaustible resource and wealth. With this "energy," there will be batches and batches of Dazhai-style people's communes, Daqing-style factories and mines,....
　　"Natural energy" needs an engine to start it, and "revolutionary energy" also needs an "engine" to start it. This "engine" is politics, is Mao Zedong Thought. In our work, if we emphasize politics everywhere and put Mao Zedong Thought in command of everything, we can mobilize this "revolutionary energy" hidden in the people to the greatest extent!

    自然能和革命能
    朱润林
    在学校念书的时候，在物理教科书上读到过“能”。什么机械能、电能、化学能、原子能，等等。所有这些能，都叫“自然能”。
      “自然能”的作用极广。在我们人类生活中，吃的、用的、住的、运输工具，那一样都离不开它。“自然能”的力量又极大，特别是原子能，是一种能量极大的能，一公斤铀全部裂变时，产生的原子能相当于两千五百吨优质煤燃烧时放出的能量呢！
    解放后的十几年来，我却愈来愈体会到，在世界上除了这种“自然能”以外，还有一种最重要的“能”，这种“能”不是别的，就是毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众的“革命能”。
    这种“能”，就是六亿五千万人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，所迸发出来的热气和干劲，就是千千万万颗精神原子弹所产生的能。它力大无比，能排山倒海，改天换地，任何困难不可阻挡，任何奇迹都能创造。它绝不是“自然能”的计量单位所能表达得了的。
    六亿五千万人民的这种“革命能”，是一种取之不尽，用之不竭的资源和财富。有了这种“能”，就会有成批成批的大寨式的人民公社、大庆式的厂矿，……。
      “自然能”，要用发动机来发动“革命能”，也需要“发动机”来发动。这部“发动机”，就是政治，就是毛泽东思想。我们在工作中，如果处处突出政治，事事以毛泽东思想挂帅，就能把这种蕴藏在人民群众身上的“革命能”，最大限度地调动起来！
