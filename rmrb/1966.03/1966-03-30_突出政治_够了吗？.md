    The Huazhou County noticed that it had focused on ideological and political work, and some cadres believed that they had grasped "enough." Whether to put politics first in the future depends on the situation. Recently, the county party committee launched a discussion:
    Is “Putting Politics First” Enough?
    Some comrades believe that highlighting politics is only a "small guarantee" for completing the current production increase task. Whether to highlight politics after production is good depends on the situation. What situation? That is, if the material conditions are good, you don’t need to highlight politics; if the material conditions are poor, you can highlight politics again. If politics only plays a "small guarantee" role when the material conditions are poor, how can politics command production, command all work, and play a major guarantee role? Is it "putting politics first" or "storming politics"? These types of questions need further discussion. Editor
    The Huazhou County Party Committee of Guangdong Province leads the people of the county to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously highlight politics, and achieve the main indicators of the "National Agricultural Development Program" two years ahead of schedule. At present, the spring plowing preparations are also quite solid.
    Having achieved such results, is it enough? No one openly says it is enough. But many people also say, ideological and political work depends on the situation! We are a county office, a grassroots unit, and the masses, how can we compare with the People's Liberation Army? With such achievements, isn’t it enough?
    Is it enough?
    Recently, the Huazhou County Party Committee held a political work conference, studied Chairman Mao's works on political work, and conducted discussions around the question of "Is it enough?" using criticism and self-criticism. Everyone believes that the ideological and political work already done is far from enough compared with the actual needs.
    Take the study of Chairman Mao's works, for example. Although a surge of enthusiasm for learning has been formed among cadres and the masses, leading learning organizations and systems have been established in the organs, and communist night schools have been set up in the countryside, many activists in studying Chairman Mao's works have emerged, and good people and good deeds continue to appear. However, some units have not studied well enough, and the idea of why they are studying has not been thoroughly resolved.
    Let's talk about grasping living ideas. The political organizations and personnel at all levels and departments in the county have been basically equipped, and it has been proposed that the whole party grasp and everyone do ideological and political work. However, there is a lack of vigorous praise and positive education for cadres and the masses. When the task is heavy, more tasks are assigned and more use is made, but less patient persuasion and education. Ideological and political work is not lively enough, not detailed enough, and has not been done to everyone's heart, to every thing, to achieve concerted efforts from top to bottom to complete various tasks. In some places, bureaucratic and coercive methods are even adopted to carry out work. For example, when the Nawu Commune inspected production, it found that a production team of the Gaopo Brigade had plowed two mu of green manure, and the commune immediately set a time limit for the team to turn over the plowed green manure, irrigate it, and fertilize it. Otherwise, responsibility will be investigated.
    What should be particularly pointed out is that although the county's rice yield per mu reached more than 800 jin last year, about half of the communes have not reached the county's average yield per mu. At present, there are still some problems in soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction. Why is this? An important reason is that in the struggle for production, there is still a clear struggle between two ideologies and two worldviews. It is necessary to quickly put ideological and political work ahead of production and promote production with politics.
      Find the root cause
    Why do some people think it is enough? The main reason is that there are several vague understandings:
    Is highlighting politics "storming" politics? Some comrades said: Production has a seasonality, shouldn’t politics have a temporality? Therefore, they believe that highlighting politics is only a task. They have concentrated time and effort to grasp it for a year, and now they should highlight grasping production and other work. They regard highlighting politics as a small guarantee for completing a specific task and separate politics from production. This view of "storming" politics is also the reason why they say "enough." Politics can only be highlighted and should not be stormed. Politics must always command everything. This is the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism. Political work must be done frequently and continuously, by everyone, at all times, and everywhere. Only in this way can the revolutionary thought of the proletariat occupy all positions.
    How can politics be considered implemented? Another saying that it is "enough" is: political organizations have been established in various departments, and a certain number of personnel have been assigned. It should be said that politics has been implemented. Of course, in order to better grasp politics, it is necessary to establish certain organizations and personnel, which is also an aspect of political implementation. However, if you only consider personnel and organizations without engaging in ideological and political work and without looking at the effect, this is actually empty talk about politics and does not count as implementation. How can it be considered implemented? First of all, it must be implemented in the ideological revolutionization of people, establishing a world view of everything for the revolution; it must be implemented in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, so that Mao Zedong Thought penetrates deeply into the hearts of the people.
    Is it passable or is it excellent? The comrades who say "enough" only seek to be passable in their own, their unit's, and their region's ideological revolutionization, not excellent. They said: "The work has neither errors nor improvements, and all tasks have been completed, which is already passable." In essence, this is not firmly establishing the proletarian world view, lacking the idea of continuous revolution, and is a manifestation of not highlighting politics. Only seeking to be passable, they are unwilling to work hard to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Only by pursuing excellence every day, continuing to highlight politics in all work, striving to study Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously accelerating their own ideological revolutionization, can they always be excellent, withstand any storm, overcome all difficulties, and achieve new achievements.
    Is good production good politics? In the past, although a major debate was organized on the relationship between politics and production, it was not well resolved in the depths of the minds of some people. They still believe that good production is good politics. They said: "The production was done well last year, isn't highlighting politics enough?" This view is of course very wrong. Using a purely production point of view to lead production, even if production goes up temporarily, the thinking of cadres and members will develop in the wrong direction, and as a result, coercive orders and material incentives may appear in leading production. Coercive orders cannot do good work, and material incentives will lead to revisionism.
      What to do
    In order to continue to highlight politics, the meeting decided to thoroughly implement the instructions of the superior party committee on highlighting politics and studying Chairman Mao's works. The county party committee should take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works well, further realizing the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee, and driving the ideological revolutionization of the people of the county. At the same time, implement highlighting politics in improving leadership style and leadership methods. Members of the county party committee should go deep into reality, each choose several brigades to establish political work points, conduct investigations and research, understand the ideological situation of cadres and the masses in each period, vigorously grasp living ideas, and unswervingly highlight politics forever.

### “突出政治”够了吗？

专栏：

    化州县注意抓了思想政治工作，有些干部认为抓“够了”，以后是否突出政治得看情况。最近县委展开讨论：
    “突出政治”够了吗？
    有的同志认为，突出政治只是完成当前增产任务的“小保证”，生产好了以后，是否突出政治得看情况。看什么情况？那就是，物质条件好，可以不突出政治；物质条件差，再来突出政治。如果政治只有在物质条件差的情况下，起“小保证”作用，那么，政治怎样去统帅生产，统帅一切工作，起大保证的作用呢？“突出政治”还是“突击政治”？这类问题，需要进一步讨论。  编  者
    广东化州县委带领全县人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治，提前两年实现了“全国农业发展纲要”的主要指标。目前备耕工作也抓得比较扎实。
    取得了这样的成绩，够了吗？公开说够了的人是没有的。但是也有不少人这样说，抓思想政治工作得看情况呀！我们这里是县的机关，是基层，是群众，怎能与人民解放军比呢？有了这样的成绩，难道还不够吗？
    够了吗？
    最近，中共化州县委召开了一次政治工作会议，学习了毛主席有关政治工作的著作，围绕“够了吗”这个问题，运用批评与自我批评的方法进行讨论。大家认为，已经做了的思想政治工作与实际需要比还不够得很。
    就说学习毛主席著作吧，尽管形成了干部群众学习的热潮，机关建立了领导学习机构和制度，农村的共产主义夜校都办起来了，涌现了很多学习毛主席著作的积极分子，好人好事不断出现。但是，一部分单位是学得不够好的，为什么而学的思想未彻底解决。
    再说抓活思想。全县各级各部门的政治机构、人员都基本配齐，并提出全党抓、人人做思想政治工作。但是，对干部群众缺乏大力表扬和正面教育，任务繁重的时候，交代任务多，使用多，耐心说服教育少。思想政治工作做得不够活，不够细，没有把工作做到每个人的心坎上，做到每件事情上，达到上下齐心协力去完成各项任务。有个别地方甚至还采取官僚主义和强迫命令的方法去进行工作。如那务公社检查生产时，发现高坡大队一个生产队犁了两亩绿肥，公社即限期要这个队把犁掉的绿肥翻回来，灌水施肥。否则，要追究责任。
    特别应该指出的是，去年全县稻谷亩产虽然达到了八百斤以上，但还有一半左右的公社未达到全县亩产平均数。目前改土积肥、兴修水利等工作也还有一些问题。为什么会这样？一个重要的原因是，在生产斗争中，还存在着明显的两种思想、两种世界观的斗争。需要迅速地把思想政治工作做在生产的前头，以政治促生产。
      找根源
    为什么有些人却认为够了呢？主要是有几种模糊的认识：
    突出政治是不是“突击”政治？有的同志说：搞生产有个季节性，难道搞政治就不应有时间性吗？因此，认为突出政治只是一项任务，已集中时间和力量抓了一年，现在应突出抓好生产和其他工作。他们把突出政治当作完成当前某一项具体任务的小保证，并把政治和生产分割开来。这种“突击”政治的看法，也就是他们说“够了”的理由。政治只能突出而不应当突击，政治必须永远统帅一切，这是马克思列宁主义的根本原理，政治工作必须经常地不断地做，人人做，时时做，处处做。只有这样，才能使无产阶级的革命思想占领一切阵地。
    政治怎样才算落实？认为“够了”的另一个说法是：各个部门都建立了政治机构，配备了一定数量的人员，应该说政治已经落实了。当然，为了更好地抓好政治，建立一定的机构和人员是必要的，也是政治落实的一个方面。但是，光从人员、机构去考虑，而不去从事思想政治工作，不看效果，这实际是空谈政治，不算落实。怎样才算落实？首先要落实到人的思想革命化上，树立一切为革命的世界观；落实到活学活用毛主席著作上，使毛泽东思想深入人心。
    过得去还是过得硬？说“够了”的同志，对自己、对本单位、本地区的思想革命化，只求过得去，不求过得硬。他们说：“工作既不出错误，又有所提高，各项任务都完成了，已经过得去了。”这实质上是没有牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，缺乏不断革命的思想，是不突出政治的表现。只求过得去，就不愿下苦功活学活用毛主席著作。只有天天追求过得硬，继续在各项工作中突出政治，努力学习毛泽东思想，不断加速自己的思想革命化，才能时时过得硬，顶得住任何惊涛骇浪，战胜一切困难，取得新的成就。
    生产好是不是政治好？过去，虽然组织了关于政治与生产关系的大辩论，但在一部分人的思想深处并未解决得很好。他们还是认为，生产好了，就是政治好。他们说：“去年的生产搞好了，突出政治还不算够了吗？”这个观点当然是十分错误的。以单纯的生产观点来领导生产，即使生产一时上去了，但是干部和社员的思想却向错误的方向发展了，其结果，在领导生产上，可能会出现强迫命令和物质刺激。强迫命令不能做好工作，物质刺激会出修正主义。
      怎么办
    为了继续突出政治，会议决定深入贯彻上级党委关于突出政治大学毛主席著作的指示。县委更要带头学好毛主席著作，进一步实现县委思想革命化，带动全县人民的思想革命化。同时，把突出政治落实到改进领导作风和领导方法上，县委成员分头深入实际，各选择几个大队建立政治工作点，进行调查研究，了解每个时期干部群众的思想情况，大抓狠抓活思想，坚定不移地永远突出政治。
