    Hearts Must Be Filled with the Entire People
    Comrade Jiao Yulu always thought of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and always maintained a style of hard work and plain living. Although I was a sufferer in the old society, after entering the city, my class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants gradually faded. Comrade Jiao Yulu had the entire people in his heart, with only himself missing; but what about me? I often consider myself more "valuable" than an ordinary poor or lower-middle peasant. I always feel that I have been revolutionary for many years, have made some contributions, and now that I am older and weaker, it is good to have a little more comfort in what I eat, wear, and use. In other aspects, I also rely on my seniority, rarely participate in labor, and don't want to go when riding a bicycle against the wind. I am not as concerned about the suffering of the poor and lower-middle peasants as Comrade Jiao Yulu was. For example, some mountain villages, once they encounter spring drought, not to mention farming, even drinking water is difficult. These problems have not been solved for many years. How can I say that I share weal and woe with the poor and lower-middle peasants!
    Through studying Jiao Yulu, I feel that the most fundamental reason why I am like this is that Mao Zedong Thought has not yet taken root in my mind, and my thinking has not been revolutionized. In a long period of peace, I have relaxed my vigilance against class and class struggle, and my thinking has been eroded by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, thus fostering arrogance, laziness, and officialdom, and weakening revolutionary aspirations.
    In the future, I will study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work. I will go deep into reality, investigate and research, stay in a selected spot, and guide the whole area. I must re-plan the fundamental solution to the three scourges of waterlogging, drought, and alkali. Currently, we must concentrate our efforts on digging wells and opening canals, and vigorously develop water conservancy.

    心里要装着全体人民
    焦裕禄同志时时刻刻想着贫下中农，始终保持着艰苦朴素的工作作风；我在旧社会虽然是个受苦的人，但进了城以后，渐渐与贫下中农的阶级感情淡薄了。焦裕禄同志心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己；而我呢？往往把自己看得比普通的一个贫农下中农“贵重”。心里总觉得自己革命多年，也算有了贡献，现在年龄大了，身体弱了，吃的，穿的，用的，都舒适一点好。其他方面也是倚老卖老，很少参加劳动，骑车子遇到顶风就不愿意走。对贫下中农的疾苦更不象焦裕禄同志那样关心。比如有的山区村庄，一遇到春旱，不用说种地，连吃水都有困难，这些年来，一直没有得到解决，这那能说与贫农下中农同甘共苦呢！
    通过学习焦裕禄，我感到自己所以会这样，最根本的原因是毛泽东思想还没有在我的脑子里扎根，思想还没有革命化。在长期的和平环境中，对阶级、阶级斗争放松了警惕，思想上受到了资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的腐蚀，因而滋长了骄气、懒气、官气，削弱了革命志气。
    今后，我要活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示；要深入实际，调查研究，蹲好点，带好面；要重新规划根治涝、旱、碱三害。当前，则要集中力量打井、开渠，大搞水利。
