    A batch of female county heads in Tibet are loved by the masses
    The eleven county heads and deputy county heads are all liberated female serfs and slaves. They diligently study Chairman Mao's works and actively lead the masses in developing production.
    Since eleven liberated female serfs and slaves in Tibet were elected as county heads and deputy county heads, they have diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, maintained close ties with the masses, and actively led the masses in developing production. The masses praise them as "Our good county heads."
    Most of these female county heads were elected last year. After taking office, they spent most of their time going deep into the grassroots to visit the poor and ask about their hardships, participating in labor while leading the masses in developing production, and achieved good results. Luo Sangquzhen, a female county head from a serf background in Dazi County, led a working group to conduct investigations in the representative Zhangduo and Zhuxi townships in order to explore the county's experience and problems in developing agricultural production. While eating, living, and working with the masses, she discovered that the abundance of grass, the lack of fertilizer, and the low quality of arable land were important reasons for the slow rate of production increase. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, she mobilized the masses to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, deep-plowed all the land with new-style walking plows, and eliminated weeds. This spring, according to the production plan formulated by the County People's Committee, she led the masses here to level land, rebuild canals, and carry out farmland capital construction. Now, the production outlook here has changed.

    西藏一批女县长受到群众爱戴
    十一位正副县长都是翻身的女农奴、女奴隶。她们努力学习毛主席著作，积极领导群众发展生产。
    西藏十一个翻身女农奴、女奴隶当选为正副县长以后，努力学习毛主席著作，密切联系群众，积极领导群众发展生产。群众称赞她们是“我们的好县长”。
    这批女县长大部分是去年当选的。她们担任县长后，绝大部分时间都深入到基层访贫问苦，一边参加劳动，一边领导群众发展生产，取得了良好的成绩。达孜县农奴出身的女县长罗桑曲珍，为了摸索这个县发展农业生产的经验和问题，带领一个工作组深入到有代表性的张多和主西两个乡进行调查。她在与群众同吃同住同劳动中，发现这里草多、肥少、耕地质量不高，是增产速度不快的重要原因。于是，她在秋收后就发动群众大搞积肥，用新式步犁深翻了全部土地，并消灭草害。今春，她根据县人民委员会制定的生产规划，又带领这里的群众平整土地，改建水渠，进行农田基本建设。现在，这里的生产面貌已有了改变。
