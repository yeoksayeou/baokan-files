    One Cannot Swallow Whole
    Cui Meng
    The author of "Journey to the West" describes Zhu Bajie eating a ginseng fruit like this: he took it and "swallowed it whole." When we read this passage, we only find it funny and don't worry that Zhu Bajie will choke. Because "that Bajie has a big stomach and a big mouth." It's just that he can't "taste any flavor," which is a bit of a pity.
    Ordinary people like us don't have Zhu Bajie's
  "ability," so naturally, we won't swallow ginseng fruit whole. However, there's a saying about swallowing dates whole. This is just teasing those who are careless and don't digest what they consume, and it may not actually happen. Even if one really swallows a date whole due to a momentary lapse, I guess, with today's medical conditions, it wouldn't be too dangerous.
    But if one swallows something else whole, for example, dealing with a certain matter without thinking or analyzing, rashly handling it. Or, for example, taking a certain experience, without analysis, affirming or negating it entirely. This kind of swallowing whole is really a bit dangerous.
    Each of us has our own experiences, successful and unsuccessful. If we don't distinguish between the positive and negative, and come up with a "swallow whole" approach, either treating everything as successful and affirming it all, or treating everything as unsuccessful and negating it all, and acting according to this view, there will inevitably be problems. Even if we distinguish between positive and negative experiences and still "swallow whole," seeing what's right as absolutely right and what's wrong as absolutely wrong, failing to see that successful experiences also have shortcomings that need to be supplemented and developed; that failed experiences are not without lessons that can be drawn and can be transformed under certain conditions. In this way, it is easy to apply successful experiences everywhere indiscriminately, and thinking of failed experiences, one can't help but feel scared, the so-called "once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of well rope," is a reflection of this situation.
    There is a fundamental viewpoint issue here. We are working under the guidance of the Party's correct line. We have done a lot of work with good intentions, and some things have been done correctly. Some things should have been done, but because we lacked experience and the measures were not correct, they were done badly, which is of course not good. But no matter what, we cannot negate the matter itself because of this. Improper methods do not mean that the matter itself is wrong. As for some things that should not have been done in the first place, then of course they should not be done again.
    Years of experience tell us that people's progress and the development of work depend not only on how we treat successful experiences but also on how we treat the lessons of failure. Since we are doing work, it is inevitable to make mistakes and to encounter failures. However, failure can be transformed into success, and mistakes can be transformed into correctness. The condition for this transformation is summing up, which is analysis. The so-called analysis, in this context, is also revealing the contradiction between the subjective and the objective: what objective things are originally like, and why the subjective understanding did not correctly reflect them, and errors occurred. If the error is corrected, the subjective conforms to the objective, can't the matter be done successfully?
    Of course, when we say don't be afraid of failure, we are not encouraging another emotion: being indifferent to failure and mistakes. While it's true that one shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater, the bathwater must be poured out. "Once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of well rope" is certainly not right, but since one has been bitten by a snake, one should not forget that snakes bite people, and one cannot be careless. The lessons of failure must be firmly remembered, and one should always try as much as possible not to repeat them. Otherwise, getting bitten by a snake again would be too inappropriate.
    Dealing with things has similarities to eating. One cannot swallow food whole; one must cut it open and eat it. One cannot swallow matters whole either. In philosophical terms, this means analysis, analysis, and more analysis.

    囫囵吞不得
    崔蒙
    《西游记》的作者这样描写猪八戒吃人参果：拿过来，“囫囵吞咽下去”。我们看这段书，只觉得好笑，并不担心猪八戒会噎得透不过气来。因为“那八戒食肠大，口又大”。只是不能“尝出些滋味”，倒是有些可惜。
    我们普通人没有猪八戒那样的
  “绿法”，自然不会有囫囵吞人参果那样的事情。不过囫囵吞枣的说法是有的。这也只是挖苦那些粗枝大叶、食而不化的人，未必确有其事。退一步说，即便真的一时大意，囫囵吞了个把枣子，据我猜想，有了现在的医疗条件，也不致有多大的危险吧。
    可是如果囫囵吞了别的什么东西，比方说对某一件事情，不动脑筋，不作分析，贸然处理。又比方，对某一种经验，不加分析，全盘地肯定或否定。这样的囫囵吞，真的就有些危险了。
    我们每个人都有自己的经验，成功的，失败的，都有。如果不分辨正面反面，来个“囫囵吞”，或者通通当作成功的，一律肯定；或者通通当作失败的，一律否定，并且照这样的看法办事，是没有不出岔子的。即使分清了正面经验和反面经验，仍然来个“囫囵吞”，对的看成绝对的对，错的看成绝对的错，看不见成功的经验也有不足之点，需要补充和发展；失败的经验也不无可资借鉴之处，在一定条件下可以转化。这样，就很容易拿成功的经验，到处乱套，而想到失败的经验，不免心里发怵，所谓“一遭被蛇咬，十年怕井绳”，正是这种情形的反映。
    这里有一个基本观点的问题。我们是在党的正确路线指引下工作的。我们好心好意地作了许多工作，有些事情办对了。有些事情本来是应当办的，只是因为没有经验，措施不对头，办坏了，这当然不好。但是不管怎么样，不能因此否定这事情的本身。作法不当，不等于事情本身不对。至于有些本来就不应当办的事情，那当然不应当再办了。
    多年来的经验告诉我们，人们之所以有进步，工作之所以有进展，固然要看我们怎么样对待成功的经验，同时也要看我们怎么样对待失败的教训。既然作工作，就难免要犯错误，就难免要遇到失败。但是，失败可以转化为成功，错误可以转化为正确。这个转化的条件，就是总结，就是分析。所谓分析，在这里也就是揭露主观和客观的矛盾：客观事物本来是什么样子的，主观认识为什么没有正确地反映它，而发生了错误。纠正了错误，主观符合了客观，事情不就可以办成功了么？
    当然，我们说不要害怕失败，并不是鼓励另一种情绪：对失败和错误，满不在乎。泼洗澡水固然不能连孩子一起泼掉，但是洗澡水是一定要泼掉的。“一遭被蛇咬，十年怕井绳”，固然不对，但是既然被蛇咬过，就不要忘记蛇是咬人的，不能麻痹大意。失败的教训，一定要牢牢地记取，总是要尽可能地不再重复它。否则，再让蛇咬一口，那就太不应当了。
    办事情，和吃东西有类似的地方。吃东西不能囫囵吞，要切开来吃；办事情，也不能囫囵吞，用哲学术语来说，这就是要分析，分析，再分析。
