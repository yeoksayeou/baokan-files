    Albanian Military and Civilians Warmly Endorse the Party Central Committee's Revolutionary Measures
    People's Army Officer Says: The new measures will strengthen the ties between officers and soldiers, and between the military and the people. Let the imperialists and revisionists tremble at the further strengthening of our armed forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 15th - After the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee's open letter to the people of the whole country on March 4th was published, the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals and officers and soldiers of the People's Army in Albania held meetings or wrote letters to the Labor Party Central Committee one after another, expressing their warm support and endorsement.
    Workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises in Tirana, Vlora, Durres and other places unanimously stated in their letters to the Party Central Committee that they fully agree with the Party Central Committee's revolutionary measures, and will do everything in their power to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and strive for the victorious realization of the Fourth Five-Year Plan that began this year. The workers and staff of the "Lenin" Cement Plant in Vlora assured the Party that although some workers have now returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, they will produce 39,000 tons more cement than originally planned with fewer personnel.
    After discussing the open letter, the cadres of the Trashan Agricultural Cooperative in the Lezhë District decided that all cadres should actively participate in physical labor and strive to complete at least 100 workdays per person within a year. After discussing the open letter, the leading cadres of the "Border Guard Fighter" Agricultural Cooperative in the Shkodër District were determined to change their work style and strive to participate more in physical labor.
    Intellectuals also warmly welcomed the measures taken by the Party Central Committee. Paparisto, Vice President of the University of Tirana, said, "We regard the Party's proposed adjustment of the ratio between high wages and middle and low wages as a very correct measure. This measure has profound political and ideological significance and is an effective weapon in the struggle against intellectuals' detachment from the broad masses of working people and their disdain for physical labor. We wholeheartedly agree with this measure."
    The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Army unanimously warmly supported and fully agreed with the Party Central Committee's revolutionary measures to strengthen the People's Army. People's Army officer Priviti said, "We can fight without ranks. We are not fighting for ranks. We are fighting to defend the motherland, the people, and socialism." In a letter to the Party Central Committee, all the officers and soldiers of a certain unit fully agreed to the measures of realizing the Party's leadership over the troops and military organs through Party committees at all levels, re-establishing political commissars in command headquarters at all levels, abolishing the rank system, and adopting new military uniforms. In the letter, they said: "We assure the Party that we will gloriously complete all the tasks put forward to us by the Party, even at the cost of our lives." Bachiqa, a senior officer of the People's Army, published an article in the newspaper, saying: "The transition to the new command system and the abolition of the rank system will improve and strengthen the discipline of the army and improve and strengthen the ties between officers and soldiers, and between the army and the people." He emphasized, "Let the people and friends be happy for the further strengthening of our armed forces, and let the imperialists and revisionists tremble for the further strengthening of our armed forces."

    阿尔巴尼亚军民热烈拥护党中央革命化措施
    人民军军官说：新的措施将加强官兵、军民之间的联系，让帝国主义者和修正主义者为我们武装部队的进一步加强而颤抖吧。
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会三月四日致全国人民的公开信发表以后，阿尔巴尼亚工人、农民、知识分子和人民军广大官兵纷纷举行集会或者写信给劳动党中央，表示热烈拥护和支持。
    地拉那、发罗拉、都拉斯等地的工矿企业的职工在写给党中央的信中一致表示，他们完全同意党中央的革命措施，并且将尽所有力量完成党所交给的任务，为胜利实现今年开始的第四个五年计划而奋斗。发罗拉“列宁”水泥厂的职工向党保证，尽管目前有一部分工人回到了农村参加农业生产，但是他们将在人员减少的情况下比原订计划多生产三万九千吨水泥。
    莱希区特拉尚农业合作社的干部在讨论了公开信以后，决定全体干部积极参加体力劳动，争取每人在一年之内至少完成一百个劳动日。斯库台区“边防战士”农业社的领导干部在讨论公开信以后，决心改变工作作风，争取多参加体力劳动。
    知识分子也热烈欢迎党中央所采取的措施。地拉那大学副校长帕帕里斯托说，“我们把党提出的调整高工资同中等工资和低工资之间的比例看作是十分正确的措施。这一措施具有深刻的政治思想性，是反对知识分子脱离广大劳动人民群众、轻视体力劳动态度的有效斗争武器。我们衷心地同意这一措施。”
    人民军广大官兵一致热烈拥护和完全赞同党中央关于加强人民军队的几项革命措施。人民军军官普里夫蒂说，“没有军衔我们一样战斗，我们不是为了军衔而斗争，我们是为保卫祖国、为人民和社会主义而斗争”。某部全体官兵在致党中央的信中，完全同意通过党各级委员会来实现党对部队和军事机关的领导、在各级指挥部重新设立政治委员和取消军衔制以及采用新军装等措施。他们在信中说：“我们向党保证，我们将光荣地完成党向我们提出的一切任务，不惜牺牲自己的生命”。人民军高级军官巴奇卡在报上发表文章说：“过渡到新的指挥制度和取消军衔制将提高和加强军队的纪律，提高和加强官兵之间、军队和人民之间的联系”。他强调说，“让人民和朋友为我们武装部队的进一步加强而高兴，让帝国主义者和修正主义者为我们武装部队的进一步加强而颤抖吧。”
