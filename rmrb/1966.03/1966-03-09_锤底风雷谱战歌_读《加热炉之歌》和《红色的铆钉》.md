    Hammer-Bottom Wind and Thunder Score War Song
    ——Reading "Song of the Heating Furnace" and "The Red Rivet"
    Lanzhou Chen Bing, Pei Yuntian, Li Yuhe
    Qi Jiguang and Wang Fangwu are workers at the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and are young singers who emerged amidst the battle drums of the Great Leap Forward. Over the past few years, they have grown rapidly under the Party's cultivation. In Qi Jiguang's "Song of the Heating Furnace" and Wang Fangwu's "The Red Rivet" (see "Sprout Series"), the authors sing of the boiling struggle life with surging passion and heroic tones, vividly and promptly reflecting the enthusiastic scenes of the socialist revolution and construction.
    First, the authors enthusiastically express the soaring aspirations of China's working class. They use powerful verses, like the clanging sound of a hammer striking an anvil, to express the heroic feelings of the working class as masters of life, their ambition to transform the world, and their fighting spirit to have a global perspective through their praise of their own labor. Like Qi Jiguang's "Lathe Worker's Ballad":
    I dare to peel off scales from the steel dragon,
    I can skin layers from the iron tiger.
    Right under my cutting tool,
    I’ll make the main bearing for the era’s flying car!
    To realize this grand ideal, they are engaged in creative labor with the posture of fighters. Their labor is full of a tense and enthusiastic fighting atmosphere: "Oh, the red world, - here! Ten thousand suns, - burn the furnace bottom! Here, thunder and fire intertwine, and winds and clouds rise!" And the people fighting here are "seizing victory from the flames," are carrying out a fiery revolution:
    Is it quenching or annealing?
    Ask every part yourself!
    Is it strong or weak?
    Every material must be extremely vigilant!
    See who gets redder as they are refined in the furnace!
    See who turns into black mud in the furnace!
          ——Qi Jiguang: "Song of the Heating Furnace"
    These heroic and compelling verses vividly depict the image of the working class as revolutionaries who transform the world and also transform themselves. However, our authors did not stop at this point; they are people with global vision, and their eyes are focused on the changing situation around the world. In their own positions, they "look up and look down," and see "workers lying in the streets of New York, workers imprisoned in Brazil, young girls in London selling their youth, young Italian boys selling their plasma..." (Wang Fangwu, "On the Overhead Crane"). They know deeply:
    All the fighting rivers in the world,
    Linked into a chain on the assembly line!
    All the awakened peaks in the world!
    Listening to the signals of the assembly line!
    All the furious oceans in the world,
    Roaring in unison with the assembly line!
      ——Qi Jiguang: "Lyrical Poem on the Automobile Assembly Line" How heroic and moving is the internationalist spirit of the highly conscious Chinese working class, their efforts to turn their country into a base for supporting the struggles of the revolutionary people of the world, expressed through these fiery verses! Only singers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have such a broad mind and sing the powerful voice of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is well reflected in Qi Jiguang's "The Greatest Motivation":
    When I open Chairman Mao's works,
    A spring breeze blows towards me,
    It blows my mind infinitely open,
    My eyes can see beyond a thousand miles.
    Second, both authors pay close attention to the theme of cultivating revolutionary successors. They are good at grasping the key issues in the growth of revolutionary successors, showing the education of the older generation to the next generation and the vigorous spirit of the healthy growth of the next generation. Qi Jiguang's "Blood Hammer" tells a tragic story through the origin of a tool, giving us a vivid class education lesson. When we read:
    Weigh this hammer, it’s as heavy as a mountain,
    The blood of our relatives has flowed into my heart and lungs! We will also swear like the author: "The fiery land created by our predecessors, the revolutionary descendants must firmly defend it!" Wang Fangwu's "Remember This Hammer" tells us to remember class hatred through the class education of apprentices by veteran workers. The two "Tie Zhuzi, remember this hammer!" appearing at the end of the paragraph are like two thunderbolts shaking people's hearts. It is precisely because the authors use the identity and feelings of revolutionary successors to conduct self-education, so they can also educate others. These two collections of poems also focus on portraying the image of the older generation who diligently cultivate the next generation, showing the vigorous growth of the next generation. For example, Qi Jiguang's "The First Night" depicts the noble qualities of the two generations through a comical small incident; Wang Fangwu's "Testing New Recruits" draws a picture of veteran workers carefully cultivating the next generation from the side through the scene of testing new recruits:
    How many people's eyes are shining,
    How many people have smiles on their faces;
    Master Zhang, with graying temples,
    His face is full of joy,
    Holding a pipe,
    Standing on the outermost layer... This small scene is thought-provoking. From this joyful picture, we see how the young generation of our working class is growing rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought!
    These two collections are the first footprints on the authors' creative path. From a general point of view, the authors' direction is correct and their steps are solid. However, strictly speaking, the level of works in the two collections is still uneven, some works are relatively rough and superficial, and the language of some poems still needs to be polished. May these two young amateur authors better study Chairman Mao's works, take root in the front line of struggle, serve the Party's central work, and serve the "compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass" campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    锤底风雷谱战歌
    ——读《加热炉之歌》和《红色的铆钉》
    兰州  陈兵  裴云天  李裕河
    戚积广和王方武都是长春第一汽车制造厂的工人，是在大跃进的战鼓声中涌现出来的年青歌手。几年来，他们在党的培养下迅速地成长着。在戚积广的《加热炉之歌》和王方武的《红色的铆钉》（见《萌芽丛书》）这两本诗集里，作者以磅礴的激情，豪迈的调子，歌唱了沸腾的斗争生活，生动及时地反映了社会主义革命和建设的热烈场面。
    首先，作者热情奔放地抒发了我国工人阶级的壮志豪情。他们以那铁锤砸在铁砧子上似的铿锵有力的诗句，通过对自己劳动的赞颂，表现了工人阶级作为生活主人翁的豪迈感情，改天换地的雄心壮志，放眼世界的战斗气概。象戚积广的《车工谣》：
    钢龙青鳞我敢揭几片，
    铁虎黑皮我能扒几层。
    就在咱这把车刀下，
    要做出时代飞车的大轴承！
    为了实现这种宏伟的理想，他们以战斗者的姿态进行着创造性的劳动。在他们的劳动中，充满了紧张热烈的战斗气氛：“红通通的世界哟，——在这里！一万个太阳哟，——烧炉底！这儿雷火交加，风云四起！”而战斗在这儿的人们，是在“从烈火中夺取胜利”，是在进行着一场火热的革命：
    是淬火还是退火？
    每个零件都问一问自己！
    是坚强还是软弱？
    每块材料都要万分警惕！
    看谁在炉里越炼越红！
    看谁在炉里化为黑泥！
          ——戚积广：《加热炉之歌》
    这英气逼人的诗句，形象地刻划出了工人阶级改造世界又改造自己的革命者的形象。然而，我们的作者没有停留在这一步，他们是胸怀全球的人，他们的眼光，关注着五洲四海的风云变幻。在自己的岗位上，他们“抬头望啊低头瞧”，看得见“纽约的工人卧街头，巴西的工人坐牢房，伦敦的少女卖青春，意大利少年卖血浆……”（王方武《天车上》）。他们深知：
    全世界一切战斗着的江河，
    联结成一个装配线上的链条！
    全世界所有觉醒了的峰峦！
    倾听着装配线上运转的讯号！
    全世界一切暴怒的大洋，
    与装配线同声在呼啸！
      ——戚积广：《汽车装配线抒情》高度觉悟的中国工人阶级，他们那种努力把自己的国家变成支援世界革命人民斗争基地的国际主义精神，通过这些火辣辣的诗句表现出来，是多么的豪壮动人！只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的歌手，才会有这样宽阔的襟怀，才会唱出用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级战斗的强音。这一点，在戚积广的《最大的动力》中得到了较好的体现：
    当我把主席著作打开，
    一股春风迎面扑来，
    它吹得我心胸无限开阔，
    双眼能望到千里之外。
    第二，两位作者都很注意关于培养革命接班人的题材。他们善于抓住革命接班人成长的关键性问题，表现老一辈对下一代的教育和下一代健康成长的朝气蓬勃的气象。戚积广的《血锤》，通过一件工具的来历叙述了一个悲壮的故事，给我们上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。当我们读到：
    掂一掂这锤子重如山啊，
    亲人的血已流进了我的心肺！我们也会和作者一样宣誓：“先辈们创下的火红的江山，革命的后代要把它牢牢保卫！”王方武的《记住这一锤》通过老师傅对学徒的阶级教育，告诉我们要牢记阶级仇。诗中两个“铁柱子，记住这一锤！”分别出现于段落的结尾，就象两声巨雷震撼着人的心坎。正因为作者以革命接班人的身份和感情来作自我教育，因而也就能够教育别人。这两部诗集还着力刻划老一辈人辛勤培养下一代的形象，表现下一代的茁壮成长。如戚积广的《第一夜》，通过喜剧性的小事件描绘了两代人的高贵品质；王方武的《考新手》通过考新手的场面，从侧面画出老师傅精心培育下一代的形象：
    多少人眼睛亮闪闪，
    多少人脸上挂笑纹；
    鬓发斑白的张师傅，
    满面红光喜盈盈，
    叨着个烟斗，
    站在最外层……这个小镜头是耐人寻味的。从这喜气盈盈的画面里，我们看到在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我们工人阶级的年青一代是在怎样迅速地成长着！
    这两本集子是作者创作道路上的第一个脚印，从总的方面看来，作者的方向是正确的，步子是踏实的。但是，严格地说，两个集子里的作品水平还参差不齐，有些作品比较粗糙浮浅，有些诗的语言也还欠锤炼。愿这两位青年业余作者更好地学习毛主席著作，扎根斗争的第一线，为党的中心工作服务，为“比、学、赶、帮、超”的增产节约运动服务。
