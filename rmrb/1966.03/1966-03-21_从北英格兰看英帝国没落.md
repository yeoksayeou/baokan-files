　　Looking at the Decline of the British Empire from Northern England
　　Now is Not What it Used to Be

　　Newcastle is the main city in Northern England. Historically, this region was once a symbol of the “prosperity” of the British Empire. Local coal mines were abundant, with production accounting for one-fifth of the country's total, making it an important base for British industrial power. There is a British saying, "carrying coal to Newcastle," used to describe people doing something "unnecessary." In 1825, the world's first railway appeared between Darlington and Stockton in this region. In those years, Britain's ocean-going merchant fleet once dominated the world, and the Union Jack of the Kingdom of Great Britain flaunted its power in the five continents, earning the nickname "the empire on which the sun never sets." This region was also an important center for Britain's shipbuilding industry and shipping industry.

　　However, since the 20th century, especially after the Second World War, under the constant impact of the revolutions of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the foundation of this old empire has long been crumbling, and the British Commonwealth is on the verge of disintegration. Coupled with the attacks and exclusion by US imperialism, and the competition and challenges from the Common Market led by France and West Germany, today's Britain is declining and is no longer what it used to be. Northern England has become an epitome of the decline of the British Empire.

　　Arriving in Newcastle, people see rugged and uneven alleys and old, black brick houses, showing a desolate and bleak scene.

　　The mayor told visiting reporters a true tragedy. A young orphan named Neil initially worked as a farm laborer on a farm near here, but later became unemployed and homeless. Unable to make a living, he eventually died miserably from hunger and cold. His death aroused public outrage, so the government established an orphanage. The mayor proudly said that this orphanage now houses 600 people, as if it were a significant political achievement. However, behind the number 600, how many sad stories are contained!

　　"Economic Suicide"

　　Britain was originally one of the world's major coal-producing countries, with 600 years of mining history. In 1931, the annual output reached 287 million tons. However, in recent decades, due to the shrinking domestic economy and the failure of competition in the international market, Britain's coal production has been declining. In the past ten years, 400 mines have been declared closed, and hundreds of thousands of miners have been laid off. When the Labour Party was in opposition, it criticized the Conservative government for closing coal mines as "economic suicide." However, less than a year after the Labour government came to power, it announced in October last year that it would close another 150 mines, reducing the annual output from 190 million tons last year to 170 million tons, and 120,000 miners would be laid off. Strangely, this mine closure, reduction of output, and layoffs are actually included in the Labour government's so-called five-year economic "plan." Regarding this situation, even American magazines ruthlessly satirized it as "planned depression"!

　　Under this mine closure "plan," more than one-third of the mines here will be cut, and another 20,000 miners will lose their jobs. In the Billingham employment training class, I met an old miner who said that he was forced to change his profession, and his current income is only about half of his original salary, making it difficult to support his family of four.

　　In mid-February, under the threat of unemployment, 500,000 coal miners held a nationwide protest petition. More than 1,000 representatives from all over the country, under the surveillance of dozens of policemen, marched to the parliament to protest the government's policy of closing coal mines. Old Ox-Cart

　　Not far south of Newcastle is Darlington station. There, we saw the world's first train, manufactured in 1825. It is much shorter than ordinary trains today, and its towing load is only 90 tons. It has been an exhibit since 1841. This century-old antique has been repainted, setting off how old and decayed this 20th-century train station is.

　　Today, Britain's long-neglected railway transportation has become a laughing stock. The foundation is uneven, and derailments or collisions occur from time to time. Just recently, the century-old Haverheld Bridge suddenly collapsed, blocking a large number of trains to London. Successive governments, on the one hand, have continuously increased fares and freight rates, and on the other hand, have demolished a large number of railway sections that are not very profitable. Thus, in this country that claims to be developed in industry and transportation, an unprecedented ancient and modern spectacle has appeared: in the past ten years, 3,000 miles of railways have been dismantled, 2,000 passenger stations, 3,000 freight stations, and 1,600 signal posts have been closed, and nearly 150,000 people have been laid off from the railway transportation department in the past five years. This naturally aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of people. The railway bureau chief, Beeching, became the target of public criticism and was forced to resign. Only a little over a year after the Labour Party came to power, the Minister of Transport had to be replaced again.

　　"Sick Man of Europe"

　　Since the war, American capital has penetrated every corner of this country. US direct investment in Britain increased by another 135.5 million pounds last year, bringing the total to 1.625 billion pounds. Even Garro City, which now has a population of only 30,000, has a branch of the American capital's large monopoly company, Woolworth's, on the street. Through its 1,100 branches across the country, this company extracts nearly 40 million pounds in profits every year.

　　Recently, the United States and Western Europe have been gloating over the so-called "British disease" – a disease in which economic depression and financial crisis alternate with each other. Last year, the disease worsened into complications. Former Minister of Science Hogg openly admitted that Britain has become today's "sick man of Europe."

　　Seeing the situation in Northern England today, one can somewhat realize that this sick man is indeed terminally ill.

### 从北英格兰看英帝国没落

    从北英格兰看英帝国没落
    今非昔比
    纽卡斯尔是北英格兰的主城。历史上这个地区曾经是英帝国“繁荣”时代的象征。当地煤矿林立，产量占全国的五分之一，成为英国工业动力的重要基地。英国人有句谚语，叫做“背煤到纽卡斯尔”，用来形容人们“多此一举”。一八二五年，在这个地区的达林敦与斯托克项之间，出现了世界上第一条铁路。当年英国的远洋商船队一度称霸世界，船上大不列颠王国的米字旗，在世界五大洲耀武扬威，有“日不落”之称。而这个地区也正是英国造船工业和海运业的重要中心。
    可是，二十世纪以来，尤其是第二次世界大战以后，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命的不断冲击下，这个老大帝国的根基早已摇摇欲坠，大英联邦也濒于土崩瓦解。加上美帝国主义的打击、排挤，法国、西德为首的共同市场的竞争、挑战，今日的英国已经是日暮途穷、今非昔比了。北英格兰，也就成为英帝国没落的缩影。
    来到纽卡斯尔，人们看到的是崎岖不平的小巷、陈旧乌黑的砖房，显出满目萧条、惨淡凄凉的景象。
    市长向来访的记者们讲述了这样一个真实的悲剧。一个名叫尼尔的少年孤儿，起初在这里附近的一个农场当农工，后来失业流落街头，无以糊口，终于在饥寒交迫下惨死。他的死引起了社会舆论的愤慨，于是政府才成立了一所孤儿收容所。市长骄傲地说，这个收容所现在收容了六百人，仿佛是一个不小的政绩。然而，在六百这个数字背后，又包含着多少辛酸的事例呵！
   “经济自杀”
    英国本来是世界上主要产煤国家之一，有六百年的开采史。一九三一年年产量达到二亿八千七百万吨。但是近几十年来，由于国内经济的萎缩和国际市场的竞争失利，英国煤的生产早已每况愈下。近十年来已经有四百个矿井宣告倒闭，几十万矿工纷纷失业。工党在野时曾经抨击保守党政府关闭煤矿是“经济自杀”，但是工党政府上台不到一年，在去年十月就宣布又将关闭一百五十个矿井，年产量将从去年的一亿九千万吨减至一亿七千万吨，十二万矿工将被解雇。奇怪的是这关矿、减量、解雇居然列入了工党政府的所谓五年经济“计划”。对于这种情况，就连美国杂志也毫不留情地讽刺为“有计划的萧条”！
    在这个关矿“计划”下，这里的矿井将被砍掉三分之一以上，又有两万矿工将要失业。在比林翰的就业训练班里见到一位老矿工，他说他是被迫改行，目前收入只有原工资的一半左右，难以养活一家四口。
    二月中，在失业的威迫下，五十万煤矿工人举行了全国性抗议请愿，来自全国各地的一千多名代表在数十名警察的监视下，游行到议会，抗议政府关闭矿井的政策。老牛破车
    离开纽卡斯尔南行不远就是达林敦车站。在那里我们看到了一八二五年制造的世界上第一辆火车。它比现在的一般火车矮小得多，牵引载重也只有九十吨，从一八四一年起就成为展览品了。这辆一百多年老古董被粉刷一新，反衬出这个二十世纪的火车站是多么的老朽陈腐。
    今天，年久失修的英国铁路交通已经成为笑料。地基高低不平，不时发生出轨或撞车事故。就在最近，哈弗尔德的百年老桥突然倒塌，阻塞了通往伦敦的大量列车。历届政府，一方面不断提高车资、运费，一方面大量拆除获利不多的铁路地段。于是，在这个自称是工业交通发达的国家里，出现了一个闻所未闻的今古奇观：十年来，拆除铁路三千英里，关闭了二千个客车站、三千个货运站和一千六百个信号岗，近五年来铁路交通部门裁员十五万人。这自然引起了广大人民群众的不满。铁路局长比庆成为众矢之的被迫辞职。工党上台才一年多，交通部长又不得不易人。
    “欧洲病夫”
    战后以来，美国资本已经渗透到这个国家的每个角落。美国在英直接投资去年又增加了一亿三千五百万英镑，总数达到十六亿二千五百万英镑。连现在只有三万人口的加罗城，街头也出现了美国资本的大垄断公司物尔沃斯的分店。这家公司通过它在全国的一千一百家分店，每年榨取利润近四千万英镑。
    近来，美国、西欧都在幸灾乐祸地谈论着所谓
  “英国病”——一种经济萧条同财政危机相互交替的病症。去年病势恶化转为并发症。前科学大臣霍格公开承认，英国已经成为今天的“欧洲病夫”。
    看到今天北英格兰的情况，使人多少觉察到这个病夫的确已经病入膏盲了。
