    我六名工作人员回到北京
    有关部门负责人前往机场热情欢迎亲切慰问
    新华社十八日讯　被印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒打伤的中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆商务参赞处二等秘书张凤翥，新华通讯社雅加达分社记者李瑞峰，以及这些单位的工作人员史潮元、郭志修、邱国武、王启生等六人，今晚乘飞机回到北京。他们在机场受到有关部门负责人的热情欢迎。
    这六名工作人员是在三月九日、十日，在雅加达分别被印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒疯狂袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆商务参赞处、中国驻雅加达总领事馆和新华通讯社雅加达分社时打伤的。
    当张凤翥等同志乘座的飞机降落后，北京协和医院副院长白琴，著名的外科医师冯传宜和内科医师陈敏章以及护士等，立即走上机舱进行诊视。六位同志中史潮元和郭志修因伤势很重，用担架把他们从飞机上抬送下来。
    外交部副部长韩念龙，对外贸易部副部长雷任民，新华通讯社副社长邓岗等，以及受伤的同志们的家属走到飞机前面，向张凤翥等六位同志表示最亲切的慰问。一群女同志向他们献上一束束鲜花，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    张凤翥等六位同志被救护车和小汽车从飞机场一直送到协和医院。他们将在这个著名的医院受到良好的治疗。
