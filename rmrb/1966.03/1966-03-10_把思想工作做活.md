    In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, it is essential to firmly grasp the political and ideological work among the masses. How to grasp it? It is certainly necessary to clearly explain to the masses the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy in the current situation. However, more frequent and deeper political and ideological work should focus on capturing the active thoughts. In this way, political and ideological work can be lively, practical, and produce greater results.

    The mass discussions on increasing production and practicing economy at the Qingdao No. 1 Power Plant and the No. 1 Branch Factory of the Shanghai Taishan Refractory Materials Factory, introduced here, are good examples of capturing active thoughts. Through a letter from Young Pioneers and through the small matter of picking up materials from the factory's garbage heap, they truly captured the active thoughts and materials of universal significance among the masses. These two seemingly ordinary events reflect a more common ideological tendency among the workers. By seizing these two events and elevating them to the height of Mao Zedong Thought and class struggle, they immediately captured the hearts of the people and raised their awareness. Small things have a big impact.

    To make ideological work lively, those who do ideological work must first have lively thinking and a high degree of political sensitivity. Without this sensitivity, even if active thoughts and materials are presented before you, you may not see them, or you may only see their smallness and not their greatness, resulting in still failing to grasp them. Like the comrades in these two factories, being diligent in observing the various events constantly happening around them, and being able to see the big from the small, and discovering some directional and important issues from general phenomena, and conducting lively, profound, and powerful ideological education for the workers. This approach is worth promoting.

### 把思想工作做活

    把思想工作做活
    在当前的增产节约运动中，一定要抓紧对群众的政治思想工作。怎么抓？对群众讲清楚在目前形势下增产节约的重大意义，当然十分必要。但是，更经常更深入的政治思想工作，应当是抓活思想。这样，政治思想工作才能做得生动活泼，切合实际，才能产生更大的效果。
    这里介绍的青岛第一发电厂和上海泰山耐火材料厂一分厂关于增产节约的群众性讨论，就是抓活思想的好例子。他们通过一封少先队员的来信，通过从工厂的垃圾堆里拣材料这件小事，真正抓到了群众中具有普遍意义的活思想、活材料。这两件看来很平常的事情，却反映了职工中一种比较普遍的思想倾向。他们抓住这样两件事，把它提到毛泽东思想的高度、阶级斗争的高度来认识，立刻抓住了人心，提高了人的觉悟。小事情发生了大影响。
    思想工作要做得活，首先做思想工作的人思想要活，要有很高的政治敏感。缺乏这种敏感，活思想、活材料送到眼前，也可能视而不见，或者只见其小，不见其大，结果仍然抓不到它。象这两个工厂的同志那样，勤于观察周围不断发生着的种种事件，又能从小见大，从一般现象中发现一些方向性的重要问题，对职工进行生动活泼、深刻有力的思想教育。这种做法是值得提倡的。
