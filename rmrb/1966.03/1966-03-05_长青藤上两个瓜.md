    Zhang Qingming Commune is a honeysuckle vine, with deep roots and lush leaves connecting thousands of families; our East Team and West Team, – two melons on the honeysuckle vine.
    We drink from the same sweet well, together we build a flood-preventing dam; the crops are connected in one piece, like a painting, like a colorful cloud!
    The moon rises over the willow branches, the East Team is short of fertilizer and holding a meeting, who is spreading fertilizer in the field?
    The autumn harvest is ripe, thunder rumbles and shakes the earth, the East Team sends people to support…
    Shoulder to shoulder, we lift the golden tower of harvest, hand in hand, we embroider the beautiful landscape, comparing, learning, catching up, and helping each other surge like waves, the east wind blows vigorously and the waves are big.
    Our East Team and West Team, are a close-knit family; Our East Team and West Team, are two red flags spreading good news!

    长青藤上两个瓜
    张庆明公社是棵长青藤，根深叶茂连万家；俺们东队和西队，——长青藤上两个瓜。同饮一口甜井水，共筑一道拦洪坝；庄稼相连一片片，象画卷，似彩霞！月上柳梢，东队缺肥正开会，田里是谁正把肥料撒？大秋谷熟，雷声隆隆动地来，东队派出了支援的人马……肩并肩，托起丰收黄金塔，手挽手，共绣江山美如画，比学赶帮波涛涌，东风劲吹浪头儿大。咱们东队和西队啊，亲亲热热是一家；咱们东队和西队啊，两杆红旗传佳话！
