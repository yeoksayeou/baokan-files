    Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Vietnamese literary and artistic fighters, carrying the deep affection of the heroic Vietnamese people for the Chinese people, visited the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune in Shahe, a suburb of Beijing, today.

    This morning, when the comrades of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe arrived at the commune, the commune members beat gongs and drums to welcome their Vietnamese brothers and sisters from the anti-American struggle front as if welcoming their own relatives. On the walls of the commune, slogans such as "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation" and "Victory surely belongs to the great fraternal Vietnamese people" were posted everywhere.

    The commune's repair shop was transformed into a get-together venue. Qu Hui Jin, head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe and a poet, said to the commune members in an emotional tone: "Today, we have become members of your commune, so let us, as new members, sing a few songs for the old members!" Then the singing suddenly began, and the Vietnamese comrades sang Chinese and Vietnamese songs such as "Commune Members are All Sunflowers," "Chairman Mao Will Always Be With Us," "Vietnam-China," and "Yankees, You Deserve It!" At the suggestion of Guo Hanwen, secretary of the commune's Party committee, the commune members sang Vietnamese and Chinese songs such as "Swear to Defend the Motherland," "Chinese and Vietnamese People Fight Shoulder to Shoulder," and "Unity is Strength" together with their Vietnamese comrades. As soon as the singing ended, the commune members and the Vietnamese comrades shouted loudly in unison: "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    The Vietnamese comrades were invited to visit the homes of commune members. Troupe leader Qu Hui Jin visited the home of commune member Liu Baogui, and he talked with Liu Baogui about the fact that American imperialism is expanding its war of aggression. Liu Baogui said: "If needed, we are ready to fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers at any time."

    Qu Hui Jin said: "Yes! If American imperialism dares to come, we will fight them. You have already given a lot of support to our struggle."

    The Vietnamese artists also visited the commune's livestock farm, pumping station, repair shop, and welfare facilities.

    越南歌舞艺术团访问中越友好公社
    社员们盛情接待来自抗美斗争前线的兄弟姊妹
    新华社二十八日讯　越南文艺战士们今天带着英雄越南人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，访问了北京郊区的沙河中越友好人民公社。
    今天上午，当越南歌舞艺术团的同志们到达公社的时候，社员们敲锣打鼓，象迎接亲人一样地接待来自抗美斗争前线的越南兄弟姊妹。在公社的墙上，到处贴着“坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争”、“胜利一定属于伟大的兄弟越南人民”的标语。
    公社的修配厂变成了联欢的会场。越南歌舞艺术团团长、诗人瞿辉瑾用充满感情的语调对社员们说：“今天，我们成了你们公社的社员啦，让我们这些新社员向老社员演唱几首歌曲吧！”接着歌声骤起，越南同志唱起了《社员都是向阳花》、《毛主席永远和我们在一起》、《越南—中国》、《美国佬，活该！》等中越两国歌曲。在公社党委书记郭汉文的提议下，社员们同越南战友们一起唱了《誓死保卫祖国》、《中越人民并肩战斗》、《团结就是力量》等越中两国歌曲。歌声刚落，社员们和越南同志一起连声高呼：“胡志明主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    越南同志们分别应邀到社员家里去作客。瞿辉瑾团长访问了社员刘宝贵的家庭，他同刘宝贵谈起美帝国主义正在扩大侵略战争。刘宝贵说：“如果需要，我们随时准备同越南兄弟一起战斗。”
    瞿辉瑾说：“对！美帝国主义敢来，我们就打他们。你们为我们的斗争，已经作了很多支援了。”
    越南艺术家们还参观了公社的畜牧场、扬水站、修配厂和生活福利设施。
