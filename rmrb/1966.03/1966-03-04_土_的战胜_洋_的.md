    “Indigenous” Overcomes “Foreign”
    He Jiang
    Armies with inferior weapons defeated those with superior weapons; the People's Army, armed only with broadswords, spears, rifles, and hand grenades, ultimately defeated the imperialist armies equipped with modern airplanes, tanks, and artillery. The history of revolutionary war eloquently proves: "Indigenous methods" can defeat "foreign gadgets." This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out, "Taking China's situation, what we rely on is nothing more than millet plus rifles"; but, "this millet plus rifles is stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes plus tanks." Millet plus rifles are the indigenous methods of the Chinese people. Airplanes plus tanks are the foreign gadgets given by American imperialism. Indigenous methods defeating foreign gadgets is the path the Chinese people have already taken, and it is also the path that all oppressed nations and oppressed peoples are taking and will take.
    Currently in South Vietnam, indigenous methods and foreign gadgets are engaged in a contest. This is the latest and most vivid practice.
    The South Vietnamese Liberation Army, without an air force, is able to annihilate large numbers of American air forces, which is a brilliant example of how indigenous methods can deal with foreign gadgets. Over the years, the South Vietnamese military and civilians have not only shot down hundreds of airplanes with rifles and machine guns, but have also created indigenous methods to directly attack American air force bases, smashing the American modern airplanes, turning American air force bases into cemeteries for American airplanes. In 1965 alone, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces attacked American military bases fourteen times, destroying 423 American airplanes. On January 30 of this year, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces attacked the Phu Ly airport, destroying 52 American airplanes. On February 19, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces once again performed a miraculous feat: destroying 97 American airplanes at the An Khe American military base. These American airplanes, from B-57 jet bombers (each worth $1.26 million) to helicopters (each worth $240,000), had everything. These glorious victories were achieved using indigenous methods. Rice plus mortars are more powerful than bread plus supersonic airplanes; indigenous methods have subdued foreign gadgets. This is an immortal chapter in the history of warfare that deserves to be written in bold letters.
    American airplanes, these foreign gadgets, become very arrogant if you are afraid of them. If you are not afraid of them and find their weaknesses to fight them, they become paper tigers. The American propaganda machine boasts daily about its supersonic, all-weather, high-performance airplanes, making them sound truly miraculous. However, for the People's Armed Forces, based in jungles and rural areas, which can be broken up into smaller units, these gadgets are nothing great. On the contrary, the weaknesses of American airplanes are increasingly exposed to the South Vietnamese people, giving them a great opportunity to develop their creative talents in hitting American airplanes. American airplanes in South Vietnam cannot show off in the sky, and are beaten enough on the ground; this is the tragedy of the American Air Force.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once summarized the strategy and tactics of people's war as: you fight your way, I fight my way; fight if we can win, retreat if we can't. This means that you rely on modern weapons, and I rely on the masses of people with high revolutionary consciousness; you exert your advantages, and I exert my advantages; you have foreign gadgets, and I have indigenous methods; you use foreign gadgets to attack, making it impossible for you to hit me, and I use indigenous methods, enabling me to hit you. In the final analysis, the imperialist foreign gadgets will lose to the revolutionary people's indigenous methods. The history of the people's revolutionary war after World War II is written this way, and will continue to be written this way.
    Indigenous methods will not always remain at one level. Things are always developing forward. Through the practice of their own armed struggles, the revolutionary people of all countries will inevitably create and advance in the common cause of enriching the overall treasure trove of people's war strategy and tactics. The South Vietnamese people are facing the most powerful and ferocious American imperialism in the world, which uses all kinds of the latest weapons. Through years of practice, the South Vietnamese people have accumulated experience and creatively developed a complete set of fighting methods suitable for the South Vietnamese situation. Being able to annihilate a large number of air forces without an air force is a kind of creation. Engels said: "The liberation of the proletariat will also have its own expression in military affairs and will create its own special and new methods of warfare." This prediction has become a reality in the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

    “土”的战胜“洋”的
    何江
    武器差的战胜了武器好的；只有大刀、长矛、步枪、手榴弹的人民军队，最后战胜了拥有现代化飞机、坦克、大炮的帝国主义军队。革命战争的历史雄辩地证明：“土办法”能够战胜“洋家伙”。这是马克思列宁主义的一条普遍真理。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出，“拿中国的情形来说，我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪”；但是，“这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些”。小米加步枪，是中国人民的土办法。飞机加坦克，是美帝国主义给的洋家伙。土办法战胜了洋家伙，是中国人民已经走过的路，也是一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民正在走和将要走的路。
    目前在南越，土办法同洋家伙正在进行较量。这是一场最新最生动的实践。
    没有空军的南越解放军，却能消灭美国大批大批的空军，就是土办法能够对付洋家伙的一个杰出范例。几年来，南越军民不仅用步枪机枪打下成百架飞机，而且创造了直接袭击美国空军基地的土办法，把美国现代化飞机这种洋家伙砸得稀烂，把美国空军基地变成美国飞机的坟场。一九六五年一年，南越人民武装袭击美军基地十四次，击毁美机四百二十三架。今年一月三十日，南越人民武装袭击富利机场，炸毁美机五十二架。二月十九日，南越人民武装再建奇功：炸毁安溪美军基地的美机九十七架。这些美国飞机，从B—57喷气轰炸机（每架价值一百二十六万美元）一直到直升飞机（每架价值二十四万美元），应有尽有。这样辉煌的战果，就是用土办法取得的。大米加迫击炮，比面包加超音速飞机更厉害，土办法制住了洋家伙，这是战争史上值得大书特书的不朽篇章。
    美国飞机这类洋家伙，如果你怕它，它就神气得很。你不怕它，并且找准它的弱点同它斗，它就成了纸老虎。美国宣传机器天天吹嘘它的飞机超音速、全天候、高性能，说得真是神乎其神。但是，对于以丛林、农村为基地的、可以化整为零的人民武装，这些家伙并没有什么了不起。相反地，美国飞机的弱点却越来越多地暴露在南越人民面前，给了南越人民发挥打美国飞机的创造才能的大好机会。美国飞机在南越，上天逞不了能，落地挨够了揍，这是美国空军的悲剧。
    毛泽东同志曾经把人民战争的战略战术概括为：你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。这就是说，你依靠现代化的武器，我依靠有高度革命觉悟的人民群众；你发挥你的优势，我发挥我的优势；你有洋家伙，我有土办法；你使用洋家伙上阵，叫你打不到我，我使用土办法，却能打上你。归根结底，帝国主义的洋家伙，要输给革命人民的土办法。战后世界的一部人民革命战争的历史，就是这样写的，并将继续这样写下去。
    土办法，不会永远停留在一个水平上。事物总是不断向前发展的。各国革命人民通过自己武装斗争的实践，必将在丰富人民战争战略战术总宝库的共同事业中，有所创造，有所前进。南越人民面对的是世界上最强大最凶恶的美帝国主义，它使用的是各种最新式的武器。南越人民通过多年的实践，积累了经验，创造性地发展了一整套适合南越情况的打法。没有空军而能大量歼灭空军，就是一种创造。恩格斯说过：“无产阶级的解放在军事上也将有它自己的表现，并将创造出自己特殊的、新的作战方法。”这一预言，已在各国人民的革命斗争中成为现实。
