    Today, in the enthusiastic atmosphere of celebrating the great victories achieved by the soldiers and civilians of both North and South Vietnam in the early spring days, we gather here to commemorate March 19, 1950, the day of the Vietnamese people's nationwide anti-American struggle, and also to respond to the Three Continents Week of Support for the Vietnamese People. Please allow me to extend my sincere greetings of solidarity and combat to the comrade representatives, and through you, to the fraternal Chinese people. I would like to extend my friendly greetings to friends from various countries and thank you for your enthusiastic attendance at today's grand gathering.
    Comrades and friends,
    The war that American imperialism is intensifying and expanding in our country has profound roots.
    As early as after World War II, American imperialism harbored ambitions to invade Vietnam and Indochina, attempting to turn this region into an American military base and a new type of colony, in order to realize its conspiracy to oppose socialist countries and suppress the national liberation movements in Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    After the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam in 1945, American imperialism sent 200,000 troops of its lackey Chiang Kai-shek clique to northern Vietnam as a tool for interfering in our country. Although the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had already declared itself an independent, sovereign state with complete territorial integrity, the American president brazenly announced that the countries of Indochina must be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Obviously, from that time on, the United States had already妄想through the United Nations it manipulated, to annex Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
    After being driven out of mainland China, the United States took advantage of the French colonialists' successive failures and, from 1950 onwards, increasingly interfered in Vietnam and Indochina, vigorously assisting France in continuing its war of aggression.
    On March 16, 1950, the United States sent an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and seventy-one aircraft to Saigon to show off its power, arousing extremely strong waves of anger among the Vietnamese people. The next day, the guerrillas in South Vietnam opened fire on American warships with mortars. On March 19, 1950, 500,000 people in Saigon-Cholon held a massive demonstration, forcing American warships and aircraft to withdraw from South Vietnam.
    Unwilling to accept defeat, the United States signed a "joint defense" treaty with France and the "allied countries" of Indochina on December 23, 1950, and established a Military Assistance Advisory Group (M.A.A.G.) in Saigon. From that time on, the United States deepened its interference in Indochina. In the war of aggression against Vietnam, the two general staffs of the United States and France cooperated very closely. Most of the military expenses, weapons, and military supplies consumed by France in Indochina were provided by the United States. From 1950 to 1954, the United States provided France with $2.6 billion.
    In early 1954, when the French Expeditionary Force was approaching defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the United States did its best to woo Britain and other countries,妄想to intervene in Vietnam and plot to prolong and expand the war.
    The fierce struggle movement of the people of Indochina and the people of the world thwarted the American conspiracy. The Vietnamese people's historic victory at Dien Bien Phu forced the United States to attend the Geneva Conference, which restored peace in Indochina and recognized the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
    However, the nature of imperialism has not changed at all, and American imperialism has not abandoned its policy of interfering in Vietnam.
    Less than two months after the signing of the Geneva Accords, on September 8, 1954, the United States wooed Britain, France, and other countries to sign the Manila Treaty, piecing together the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc and placing South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos under the so-called "protected area" of this bloc, which clearly showed that the American conspiracy was to systematically undermine the Geneva Accords.
    While gradually replacing France in Indochina, the United States vigorously helped the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime stabilize the situation in South Vietnam, attempting to use South Vietnam as a springboard for attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The strong struggle of the people of South Vietnam caused heavy failures for American imperialism and made the puppet regime approach collapse. From 1961 onwards, American imperialism directly waged an extremely cruel "special war" against the people of South Vietnam, flagrantly violating the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese people, and seriously undermining the Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue.
    Comrades and friends,
    From the above events, we can conclude that the profound roots and direct causes of the tension in Vietnam and the Indochina region for more than 20 years have been caused by American imperialism. American imperialism's conspiracy to carry out aggression, expand the war, in order to enslave the Vietnamese people, the people of Indochina, and the people of the world, has long existed and stems from the very nature of American imperialism.
    This is the fact. This is solemnly recognized by hundreds of millions of people who love peace and justice in the world and many governments on five continents when they strongly condemn the unjust war of American imperialism and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. The so-called "aggression from North Vietnam" is nothing but a clumsy fabrication, the purpose of which is to cover up the unspeakable conspiracy of American imperialism.
    Therefore, it is no accident that the Tricontinental Conference held in Havana in January 1966, with the participation of more than 80 countries, strongly condemned the aggression of American imperialism and decided to organize and launch the International Week of Support for Vietnam from March 12 to 19, 1966.
    On this occasion, on behalf of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I would like to once again express my sincere gratitude to the people and governments of the fraternal socialist countries, to the international working class, and to friends on five continents for their wholehearted support for our just struggle.
    Vietnam and China are two neighboring countries that are as closely linked as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe, and sharing life and death. In the struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism, the people of our two countries are fighting shoulder to shoulder like brothers. Especially in the current struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, the great Chinese Party, government, and 650 million people, in the spirit of lofty proletarian internationalism, have given the Vietnamese people sincere and comprehensive support. The Vietnamese people are infinitely grateful for this precious and huge support and must fulfill their tasks at the forefront of the struggle against American aggression, defending the socialist camp, and defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world.
    Comrades and friends,
    Now, the evolution of the situation in both North and South Vietnam, especially on the battlefield of South Vietnam, eloquently proves that American imperialism's strategy of "special war" developed to the highest limit has been miserably defeated. At the same time, it shows that even if the United States sends expeditionary forces to the South to directly participate in the war and intensifies the war of destruction against the North, it still cannot turn defeat into victory.
    It is obvious that, with the help of 230,000 troops from the United States and its vassal states, with the help of wars with toxic gas and chemical agents, and with the help of extremely cruel wars of destruction, American imperialism and its running dogs simply cannot change the balance of power, nor can they change the trend of the heroic people of the South who are developing their active offensive with increasing strength.
    American imperialism uses its air force to bomb and strafe the North,妄想to save its defeat in the South, and attempts to use its air superiority to limit the weaknesses and failures of its ground war of aggression. But they are very wrong. The soldiers and civilians of our North have fought for more than 400 days and have achieved brilliant results. Up to now, more than 900 new-type American aircraft of various types have been shot down. This number is equivalent to the total number of fighter jets used by American imperialism and its running dogs in Vietnam and Laos, and equivalent to one-seventh of all American fighter jets. Hundreds of American lieutenant-grade and colonel-grade ace pilots have been eliminated, captured alive, or unable to continue fighting due to injuries. They themselves have lamented the billions of dollars spent in this war of destruction carried out by the air force.
    The source of these strategically significant victories in the war against American imperialism's war of destruction is the spirit of the soldiers and civilians of our North to "resolutely defeat the American aggressor bandits." The compatriots and soldiers of North Vietnam, together with the compatriots and soldiers of the South, are united as one, taking up arms to resist the Americans. The high tide of resisting American aggression and saving the country is surging. All branches of the Vietnamese People's Army, the militia self-defense forces, and the people's armed public security forces have fought very bravely. The whole people rose up to fight American aircraft and actively serve the battle. The dense fire net set up by the people frightened the enemy. The lifeline of transportation is still developing and operating normally. Production in factories and in the fields continues. Millions of "three-ready" youths and "three-responsible" women are an inexhaustible source of our combat power. The revolutionary momentum is rising. Everything for the front, everything to defeat the American bandits! This iron will of the Vietnamese people has been tempered in the flames of war and is becoming more and more indestructible. American bombs have also made the world people's front condemning American imperialism and supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people even stronger.
    Comrades and friends,
    On the land of our beloved motherland, American imperialism has suffered heavy political and military defeats.
    The process of American imperialism's interference and aggression against Vietnam is also the sad process of its increasing collapse. All conspiracies to strengthen the war in the South with various kinds of troops, to expand the war of destruction to the North with the air force, and to launch false peace offensives cannot save the increasingly critical situation of American imperialism and its running dogs. The so-called "economic potential," "military potential," and "absolute superiority of the American air force" cannot subdue the indomitable spirit of our Vietnamese people. Our people have already defeated the American expeditionary force and the American modern air force. The enemy is struggling frantically and formulating new adventurous plans, preparing for new "escalations."
    The Vietnamese people warn American imperialism with certainty that if it refuses to abandon its conspiracy to occupy Vietnam and solemnly announces its recognition of the four

    越南人民不赶走美国侵略者决不停止战斗
    美帝侵略越南的过程就是它日益崩溃的过程
    越南民主共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办黄北的讲话
    今天，在欢庆越南南北两方军民在初春的日子里所取得的巨大胜利的热烈气氛中，我们在这里聚会，来纪念一九五○年三月十九日越南人民的全国反美斗争日，同时也是为了响应三大洲声援越南人民周。请允许我向代表同志们，并通过你们向兄弟的中国人民致以真诚的团结和战斗的敬意。我谨向各国的朋友致以友谊的敬意，并感谢你们踊跃地出席了今天的隆重集会。
    同志们和朋友们，
    美帝国主义正在我们国家强化和扩大的这场战争有着它深远的根源。
    早在第二次世界大战之后，美帝国主义就怀着侵略越南和印度支那的野心，企图把这个地区变成美国的军事基地和新型殖民地，以便实现其反对各社会主义国家，镇压印度支那和东南亚地区的民族解放运动的阴谋。
    一九四五年八月革命在越南胜利以后，美帝国主义就把它的走狗蒋介石集团的二十万军队派到越南北方，作为干涉我国的工具。尽管越南民主共和国已经宣布为独立的、有主权的和全部领土统一的国家，然而美国总统却悍然宣布必须把印度支那各国置于联合国托管之下。显然是从那个时候起，美国就已经妄想通过它所操纵的联合国，吞并越南、老挝和柬埔寨。
    被赶出中国大陆以后，美国便利用法国殖民者节节失败的局面，从一九五○年起，日益加强干涉越南和印度支那，大力援助法国继续进行侵略战争。
    一九五○年三月十六日，美国派遣一艘航空母舰、两艘巡洋舰和七十一架飞机到西贡耀武扬威，激起了越南人民极其强烈的愤怒浪潮。就在第二天，越南南方游击队便用迫击炮向美国军舰开炮。一九五○年三月十九日，西贡—堤岸的五十万人民举行了声势浩大的示威游行，并迫使美国军舰和飞机撤出越南南方。
    美国不甘心失败，于一九五○年十二月二十三日同法国和印度支那的各“结盟国家”签订“共同防御”条约，在西贡成立了军事顾问代表团（M．A．A．G）。从那时起，美国便日益加深对印度支那的干涉。在侵略越南的战争中，美法的两个参谋部配合得非常密切。法国在印度支那所消耗军事费用、武器和军事物资大部分是由美国提供的。从一九五○年到一九五四年，美国向法国提供了二十六亿美元。
    一九五四年初，当法国远征军在奠边府接近失败时，美国就尽力拉拢英国和其它一些国家，妄想插手越南，阴谋拖延和扩大战争。
    印度支那人民和世界人民的激烈斗争运动使美国的阴谋没有得逞。越南人民在奠边府取得的历史性胜利迫使美国来到恢复印度支那的和平，承认越南、老挝和柬埔寨的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的日内瓦会议。
    但是，帝国主义的本质丝毫没有改变，美帝国主义并没有放弃干涉越南的政策。
    日内瓦协议签订还不到两个月，一九五四年九月八日，美国拉拢英、法和其它一些国家签订马尼拉条约，拼凑起东南亚军事侵略集团，把越南南方、柬埔寨、老挝置于这个集团的所谓“保护区”，这就清楚地表明美国的阴谋在于有系统地破坏日内瓦协议。
    美国一方面在印度支那逐步取代法国，另一方面则大力帮助吴庭艳走狗政权稳定越南南方的局势，企图把越南南方作为进攻越南民主共和国的跳板。
    越南南方人民的强烈斗争使美帝国主义遭到了沉重的失败，使走狗政权日益接近崩溃。从一九六一年起，美帝国主义就直接进行一场无比残酷的“特种战争”，反对越南南方人民，明目张胆地侵犯了越南人民的独立主权和领土完整，严重破坏了关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。
    同志们和朋友们，
    从上述事件中，我们可以得出结论：二十多年来，越南和印度支那地区的紧张局势的深远根源和直接原因是由美帝国主义造成的。美帝国主义进行侵略，扩大战争，以便奴役越南人民、印度支那人民和世界人民的阴谋是早已存在的，并出自于美帝国主义的本质的。
    这就是事实。这是世界上数以亿计的热爱和平和公理的人民和五大洲的许多政府在严厉谴责美帝国主义的非正义战争，坚决支持越南南方人民的爱国正义斗争时所郑重承认的。所谓“越南北方的侵略”只不过是一种漏洞百出的捏造，其目的在于掩盖美帝国主义的见不得人的阴谋。
    因此，前不久，在一九六六年一月份在哈瓦那召开的、有八十多个国家参加的三大洲会议强有力地谴责了美帝国主义的侵略，并决定从一九六六年三月十二日到十九日，组织和发动国际支援越南周，这并不是偶然的。
    借此机会，我谨代表越南民主共和国人民和政府，向各社会主义兄弟国家的人民和政府、向国际工人阶级和五大洲的朋友对于我们的正义斗争所给予的全心的支持，再一次表示真诚的谢意。
    越南和中国是两个唇齿相依，休戚与共，同生死的邻邦。在抵抗共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，我们两国人民象亲兄弟一样并肩战斗。特别是在当前的抗美救国斗争中，伟大的中国的党、政府和六亿五千万人民本着崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，给予越南人民以真诚的和全面的支持，越南人民对于这种珍贵和巨大的支持无限感激，并且一定要在抗美斗争、保卫社会主义阵营以及保卫东南亚和世界和平的斗争的最前线上完成自己的任务。
    同志们和朋友们，
    现在，在越南南北两方，特别是在越南南方战场上的局势的演变，雄辩地证明了，美帝国主义的发展到了最高限度的“特种战争”的战略已遭到了惨败，同时也表明，即使美国派远征军到南方直接参战，并对北方加紧进行破坏战争，但是它仍然不能转败为胜。
    很明显，借助于美国和仆从国的二十三万军队，借助于毒气和毒剂的战争，借助于无比残酷的毁灭性战争，美帝国主义及其走狗根本不能改变力量对比，也无法改变英雄的南方人民正在日益有力地发展着的主动进攻的趋势。
    美帝国主义用空军对北方进行轰炸扫射，妄想以此来解救它在南方的败局，并且企图利用空军优势来限制它在地面上进行的侵略战争的弱点和失败。但是它们大错特错了。我国北方军民已经战斗了四百多天，并取得了辉煌的战果。到现在为止，已有九百多架美国各种新式飞机被击落，这个数字相当于美帝国主义及其走狗用于越南和老挝的战斗机总数，相当于美军全部战斗机的七分之一，成百名美国尉级、校级王牌飞行员被消灭、活捉或因受伤而不能继续战斗。他们自己曾经哀叹在这场以空军进行的破坏战争中消耗掉数以十亿计的美元。
    在反对美帝国主义的破坏战争中的这些具有战略意义的胜利的源泉是我国北方军民“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的精神。越南北方的同胞和战士同南方的同胞和战士一起，万众一心，拿起武器抗击美国佬。抗美救国的高潮汹涌澎湃。越南人民军的各个兵种、民兵自卫力量和人民武装公安力量都进行了非常英勇的战斗。全民奋起打美国飞机，积极为战斗服务。人民张起的密集火网使敌人胆战心惊。交通运输命脉仍在发展和正常活动。工厂里和田野上的生产在继续进行。数以百万的“三准备”的青年和“三承担”的妇女是我们的战斗力的无尽的源泉。革命的气势日益高涨。一切为了前线，一切为了战胜美国强盗！越南人民的这一钢铁意志在战争的烽火中受到锤炼，并越来越变得坚不可摧。美国的炸弹还使得谴责美帝和支持越南人民正义斗争的世界人民阵线更加壮大。
    同志们和朋友们，
    在我们可爱的祖国的土地上，美帝国主义在政治上和军事上都遭到了沉重的失败。
    美帝国主义干涉和侵略越南的过程，也是它日益崩溃的可悲的过程。一切以各种各样军队来强化南方的战争，用空军把破坏战争扩大到北方，发动虚假的和平攻势的阴谋，都不能挽救美帝国主义及其走狗日益危急的局面。所谓的“经济潜力”、“军事潜力”、“美国空军的绝对优势”都降服不了我们越南人民不屈不挠的精神。我们全国人民已经把美国远征军和美国现代化空军打得落花流水。敌人正在疯狂挣扎，并拟订新的冒险计划，准备新的“升级”。
    越南人民斩钉截铁地警告美帝国主义，如果它不肯放弃侵占越南的阴谋并郑重宣布承认越南民主共和国政府的四点立场和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点立场，并付诸以实际行动，那么正如胡志明主席所说的：“只要我们的国土上还有美国侵略军，我国人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗”。
    凭着决战决胜的精神，高度发扬一九五○年三月十九日的精神，凭着日益强大的力量和日益丰富的经验，又有五大洲的朋友的热情支持，越南人民一定击败美帝国主义，为解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的事业赢得完全的胜利，为保卫东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
    越中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    美帝国主义从越南滚出去！从台湾滚出去！从南朝鲜、老挝和它在世界上所霸占的一切地方滚出去！
    世界和平万岁！
