    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 13th, strongly condemning the Australian government's decision to send an additional 3,000 accomplice troops to participate in the U.S. war of aggression against South Vietnam, and sternly warning the Australian government and other U.S. puppet governments that they must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused in Vietnam due to their collusion with the United States.

    The statement said that the Australian government's decision to send more troops to South Vietnam, made after U.S. Vice President Humphrey's activities in Australia in February, further proves that the Australian government has violated the interests and peaceful aspirations of the Australian people and has become an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against South Vietnam.

    The statement pointed out that the Australian government's above-mentioned decision grossly violates the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, is a blatant provocation against the Vietnamese people's cause of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the country, and is also a blatant challenge to the Australian people and peace-loving people of the world.

    The statement said that the U.S. aggressors are suffering disastrous defeats in Vietnam and will inevitably suffer complete defeat. No matter how many troops some U.S. puppets send to South Vietnam, they will not be able to help the U.S. aggressors reverse the situation, but will certainly meet with a tragic fate.

    The statement concluded by stating that the Vietnamese people will unite as one, determined to fight, and with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely defeat all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, and win final victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, March 12th. The Australian government's decision to send an additional 3,000 troops to South Vietnam to serve the U.S. aggressors is arousing public outrage throughout Australia.

    On the evening of the 11th, when Australian Prime Minister Holt spoke to 500 young people at the University of Melbourne, the young people shouted slogans against conscription at him. A group of demonstrators also surrounded the hall, demanding the withdrawal of Australian troops from South Vietnam.

    Students at Monash University in Melbourne set up picket lines at the university's conscription station on the 11th. They called on students not to get involved in the dirty war of aggression against Vietnam and demanded that Australian troops withdraw from South Vietnam.

    The "Youth Anti-Conscription Movement" also put forward a demand on the evening of the 9th for the government to revoke the decision to increase troops to South Vietnam.

    Approximately 120 responsible personnel from 44 trade unions in Victoria recently signed a petition protesting the government's decision to increase troops to South Vietnam.

    Paul Melrose, a student at the University of Sydney, publicly burned his conscription card at an anti-conscription rally attended by more than 250 students on the 9th. He said, "Vietnam (war) is a dirty war, and I don't want to get involved in it." The meeting passed a resolution condemning Prime Minister Holt's decision to increase troops to South Vietnam.

    Approximately 60 students from the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, along with demonstrators from other anti-conscription groups, held a demonstration outside Victoria Barracks. They held banners with slogans such as "No conscription for Hitler's worshippers" and "Conscription brings arms profits."

    越外交部谴责澳大利亚增派帮凶军去南越
    澳大利亚人民反对政府增兵参加美国侵越战争
    新华社河内十三日电　越南民主共和国外交部十三日发表声明，强烈谴责澳大利亚政府决定增派帮凶军三千名参加美国对越南南方进行的侵略战争，并且严厉警告澳大利亚政府以及其他美国的仆从政府，它们必须对由于它们同美国勾结而在越南造成的严重后果承担全部责任。
    声明说，澳大利亚政府向越南南方增派军队的决定，是在美国副总统汉弗莱二月间到澳大利亚活动之后作出的，这就更加清楚地证明，澳大利亚政府已经违背了澳大利亚人民的利益和和平愿望，成为美帝国主义在侵略越南南方战争中的帮凶。
    声明指出，澳大利亚政府的上述决定，粗暴地违反了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，是对越南人民抗美救国事业的蛮横挑衅，也是对澳大利亚人民和世界爱好和平人民的明目张胆的挑战。
    声明说，美国侵略者正在越南遭到惨败，必将遭到彻底的失败。美国的一些仆从不论向越南南方增派多少军队，也不可能帮助美国侵略者扭转局势，而肯定将遭到悲惨的命运。
    声明最后表示，越南人民将团结一致，决心战斗，在全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，必将挫败美帝国主义及其仆从的一切阴谋，赢得最后胜利。
    新华社墨尔本十二日电澳大利亚政府关于增派三千名军队到南越为美国侵略者卖命的决定，正在澳大利亚各地激起公愤。
    十一日晚，当澳大利亚总理霍尔特在墨尔本大学向五百名青年讲话时，到会青年向他高呼反对征兵的口号。一群示威者还包围了会堂，要求澳大利亚军队撤出南越。
    墨尔本摩纳什大学的学生十一日在大学征兵站布置了纠察线。他们号召学生们不要卷进侵略越南的肮脏战争中，并且要求澳大利亚军队从南越撤出。
      “青年反征兵运动”九日晚上也提出了要政府撤销增兵南越的决定的要求。
    维多利亚四十四个工会的负责工作人员约一百二十人最近在一份请愿书上签了名，抗议政府增兵南越的决定。
    悉尼大学学生保罗·梅尔罗斯九日在一个有两百五十多名学生参加的反征兵集会上，当众烧掉了他的征兵证。他说：“越南（战争）是一场肮脏的战争，我不愿卷到它里面。”会上通过了一项决议，谴责霍尔特总理决定增兵南越。
    悉尼大学和新南威尔士大学的学生约六十人和其他的反征兵团体的示威者一起，在维多利亚兵营外面举行了示威。他们举着旗帜，上面写着：“不许为希特勒的崇拜者征兵”，“征兵换来的是军火利润”等。
