    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 29th. According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on March 29th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, when speaking about US aggression against Cambodia on March 25th, said, "We will resolutely strike back at all attacks we suffer."

    Prince Sihanouk made these remarks at the inauguration ceremony of a middle school in Chhlong, Kratie province.

    Prince Sihanouk said, "Cambodia is determined to confront US imperialism and fight it tooth for tooth."

    He condemned the US for desperately arming its Thai and South Vietnamese running dogs. He said, "We must repel the aggression of them and their running dogs—our enemies, the 'Free Khmer' elements." "Therefore, we have sent troops to the border and established defensive outposts along these borders. We have opened new and wide lines of communication in the border areas."

    Prince Sihanouk said, "Our Thai enemies, seeing that we want to prevent them from continuing their territorial expansion, have laid landmines on these new roads, and their heavy artillery units bombard our newly built outposts. Their navy also bombards our coasts. But I have issued instructions to never retreat and to build strong bunkers. ... We will resolutely strike back at all attacks we suffer."

    He said, "Our aggressors have twisted the truth and have even accused us in the United Nations of attacking them. We firmly refute this."

    Prince Sihanouk said, "We will retaliate tit for tat. We really cannot let them do as they please anymore, otherwise, they will keep going until they reach Phnom Penh."

    Prince Sihanouk also said, "The South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the Patriotic Front of Thailand, China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and all those who have risen up against imperialism and US neo-colonialism will continue their respective struggles."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 26th. According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on March 26th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk reiterated on March 24th that the way to save Cambodia lies not in relying on "US aid," but in complete independence and unwavering neutrality.

    Prince Sihanouk made these remarks in a village in Kratie province.

    Prince Sihanouk said that some people insist that "in order to look the part, we must stand with the United States, use their aid, let the army enjoy the wealth that can be obtained through the generosity of their American masters, and the imposing military uniforms, vehicles, and modern military materials generously provided by the United States, etc...." Prince Sihanouk said, "All of this seems very tempting, but if you think about it carefully, you can easily discover the deceptiveness and even extreme danger of this wealth. We only need to look at the situation of those countries around us that are filled with US aid to be convinced of this."

    Prince Sihanouk said: "In South Vietnam, the army supported by Uncle Sam, after escaping death, only knows how to slaughter their own compatriots and destroy their homeland's facilities, so that those with national sentiments have abandoned their regime and turned to the Viet Cong, even though the Viet Cong are fighting in difficult conditions. ... This desertion is increasing in the South Vietnamese army, because everyone sees more and more clearly that the corrupt Saigon regime is increasingly controlled by US imperialism."

    Prince Sihanouk emphasized: "What benefits can be gained from being involved with the so-called free world? In our view, facts have already proven that the way to salvation lies in complete independence and our unwavering neutrality."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 24th, condemning the Thai authorities for their provocations and threats against the Kingdom of Cambodia.

    The statement expressed support for the Cambodian government's statement on March 20th, which firmly protested the Thai government's order for the Thai army, navy, and air force to prepare to attack Cambodia.

    The statement pointed out that the Thai authorities, under the orders of US imperialists, are not only frantically intensifying provocations against Cambodia, but are also allowing the United States to establish military bases in Thailand to conduct its war of aggression against Vietnam and sending Thai troops to interfere in Laos.

    The statement demanded that the Thai authorities immediately cease all actions serving the US imperialists' plan to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina.

    The statement said: "The Vietnamese people wholeheartedly support the fraternal Cambodian people's struggle against US imperialist aggressors and their running dogs, and to defend the independence, sovereignty, peace, neutrality, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia."

    越南外交部发表声明谴责泰国当局对柬埔寨的挑衅和威胁
    新华社金边二十九日电 据柬埔寨新闻社二十九日报道：柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十五日在谈到美国对柬埔寨的侵犯时说：“我们将坚决回击我们受到的一切攻击”。
    西哈努克亲王是在桔井省川龙的一所中学落成典礼上讲这番话的。
    西哈努克亲王说：“柬埔寨决心同美帝国主义相对抗，并且同它以牙还牙进行战斗。”
    他谴责美国拼命武装它的泰国和南越走狗。他说，“我们必须打退他们和他们的走狗——我们的敌人‘自由高棉’分子的侵略。”“因此，我们把军队派到边境上，在这些边境沿线建立了防务哨所，我们在边境地区开辟了新的和宽阔的交通线。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“我们的泰国敌人看到我们要阻止他们继续进行领土扩张，就在这些新的路上埋设地雷，他们的重炮部队轰击我们的新建哨所。他们的海军也向我们的海岸进行轰击。但是，我已经发出指示命令决不要后退，并且修建牢固的地堡。……我们将坚决回击我们受到的一切攻击。”
    他说，“我们的侵略者颠倒是非，竟然向联合国控告，说我们进攻了他们。我们坚决予以驳斥。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“我们将针锋相对地予以还击。我们确实不能够再让他们为所欲为了，否则，他们就会一直搞到金边。”
    西哈努克亲王还说，“越南南方民族解放阵线，泰国爱国阵线，中国，越南民主共和国，以及所有起来反对帝国主义和美国新殖民主义的人，都将继续进行他们各自的斗争。”
    据新华社金边二十六日电据柬埔寨新闻社二十六日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十四日重申，拯救柬埔寨的道路不在于依靠“美援”，而在于完全独立和不可动摇的中立。
    西哈努克亲王是在桔井省的一个村庄里说这番话的。
    西哈努克亲王说，有些人硬说，“为了搞得象个样子，必须同美国站在一起，利用他们的援助，让军队享用由于他们美国主子的慷慨所能够得到的富裕，以及美国慷慨提供的神气十足的军装、旅行车和现代化的军事物资等等……。”西哈努克亲王说，“所有这些好象很诱惑人，但是，如果仔细推敲一下，就能够很容易地发现这种富裕的欺骗性，甚至是极端危险的。我们只要看看我们周围的那些被美援填得饱饱的国家的情况就能确信这一点。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“在南越，由山姆大叔供养的军队，在死里逃生以后只是一味屠杀他们自己的同胞，毁坏他们祖国的设备，以致那些抱有民族感情的人背弃了他们的政权而投向越共，尽管越共是在艰苦的环境中进行战斗。……在南越军队中这种开小差的情况越来越多，因为大家都看得越来越清楚，西贡的腐败政权越来越受美帝国主义的控制。”
    西哈努克亲王强调指出：“同所谓自由世界搞在一起能够得到什么好处？在我们看来，已经有事实证明：拯救的道路在于完全独立和我们不可动摇的中立。”
    新华社河内电  越南民主共和国外交部二十四日发表声明，谴责泰国当局对柬埔寨王国进行挑衅和威胁。
    声明表示支持柬埔寨政府三月二十日发表的坚决抗议泰国政府命令泰国陆、海、空军准备进攻柬埔寨的声明。
    声明指出，泰国当局奉美帝国主义者的命令，不仅疯狂地加紧对柬埔寨进行挑衅，而且还让美国在泰国建立军事基地以进行对越南的侵略战争，并派遣泰国军队干涉老挝。
    声明要求泰国当局立即停止为美帝国主义把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的计划服务的一切行动。
    声明说：“越南人民衷心支持兄弟的柬埔寨人民为反对美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗，保卫柬埔寨王国的独立、主权、和平、中立和领土完整而进行的斗争。”
