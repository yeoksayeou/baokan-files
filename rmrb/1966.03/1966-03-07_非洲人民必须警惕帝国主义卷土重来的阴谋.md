    Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, 6th - The Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) issued a statement on the 5th, calling on the people of Congo (Brazzaville) to "support the progressive forces of Africa, especially the heroic people of Ghana," and appealing to the African people to "redouble their vigilance against colonialist plots to stage a comeback."
    The statement said that the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) studied the recent military coup in Ghana against Nkrumah and the resulting situation in Africa at a plenary meeting held in Brazzaville on the 5th.

    The statement said that the National Revolutionary Movement approved the decision of the government of Congo (Brazzaville) to withdraw the delegation of Congo (Brazzaville) participating in the Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa. It reiterated its respect for the decision made by the Organization of African Unity in December 1965 to sever diplomatic relations with Britain on the issue of Southern Rhodesia.

    The rally marked the beginning of the first anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Women's League of Congo (Brazzaville) and International Women's Day celebrations.
    Leaders of women's organizations, trade unions, and the National Revolutionary Movement addressed the meeting.
    The Chinese women's delegation led by Guo Jian also attended the rally.
    Mrs. Bouanga-Tatif, First Vice-President of the Revolutionary Women's League of Congo (Brazzaville), said at the meeting: "While someone is massively plotting a coup d'état conspiracy to stop Africa from moving towards complete liberation and unification, Congolese women support women of all countries who are waging a tenacious struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and new and old colonialism."
    She said: "These days of (celebrations) for Congolese women are also days of solidarity with the fraternal people of Ghana."
    She concluded: "For us Congolese women, the struggle has only just begun – because the struggle is a long one – the imperialists and their lackeys should understand that Africa, especially Congo (Brazzaville), is more impossible than ever to become a colony again."
    Diallo Idrissa, Secretary-General of the Congolese Trade Union Confederation, condemned the Johnson administration for stepping up its aggression against Vietnam under the guise of so-called "defending freedom." He said: "The Americans must get out of Vietnam and let the Vietnamese people solve their own affairs."
    In condemning the imperialist plot of the military coup in Ghana, he said: "The Accra coup pointed out to us that imperialism is determined to reconquer Africa and make Africa its raw material storage. Imperialism everywhere supports puppet governments loyal to its policies to plunder our resources, trample on our dignity, destroy our potential and instill imperialist ideas."
    He expressed the full and unconditional support of the Congolese workers for the Ghanaian people and called on the people to mobilize and arm themselves to form a Great Wall against imperialism and to defend Africa.
    Numazalai, First Secretary of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), encouraged male and female party members to further mobilize to deal with imperialism when talking about the military coup in Ghana.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Mogadishu News: According to a report in the "Voice of Somalia" on February 27, the Somali Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing regret over the Ghanaian coup and expressing respect for President Nkrumah's commitment to African unity.
    Somali Foreign Minister Duale said that President Nkrumah was an inspirer of African unity. Duale expressed regret over the events in Accra. Duale told reporters while attending the Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of African Unity that "from the beginning we have opposed the representation of the Ghanaian military regime here."
    According to a report in the "People's Alliance," the organ of the Somali Democratic Union, on March 1, the Somali Democratic Union telegraphed the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity, "condemning the recent shameful military rebellion in Ghana and supporting the legitimate government of President Nkrumah."
    The telegram said: "This rebellion is a wake-up call to peace-loving African countries and their leaders and the African liberation movement by imperialism. If these rebels are not punished, this disease will spread." The telegram called on African countries to immediately help Nkrumah so that he could eliminate the rebels directed by US-British imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Lusaka News: The Zambian government announced on the evening of the 4th that it would recall its High Commissioner to Ghana.
    Zambian Foreign Minister Kapwepwe, who was attending the Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa, made a statement to the meeting on the 4th, praising President Nkrumah's contribution to African liberation. He said that the current attempts against Nkrumah pleased imperialism, colonialism, and their agents.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Algiers News: Algerian Foreign Minister Bouteflika issued a statement on the 3rd regarding the Ghanaian military coup, condemning imperialism for using all means to endanger the independence of African countries.
    The statement said, "Foreign interference in Africa and other parts of the world is constantly increasing, and the goal pursued by imperialism remains to crush all efforts by the peoples of African countries to consolidate their independence and unity. Imperialism's interests in Africa are so great that it cannot automatically give them up."
    The statement pointed out that in order to protect these interests, imperialism attempts to forcibly implement its political rule everywhere.
    The statement said that the Algerian government does not intend to interfere in matters that are only related to the Ghanaian people. "However, since the current events are caused by an imperialist conspiracy, and since these events endanger the stability and independence of African countries, Algeria feels that it is directly related to these events." The statement emphasized that Algeria should remain vigilant and prepared to deal with any aggression from imperialism.
    A recent issue of "Revolution and Labor," the organ of the General Union of Algerian Workers, published an article stating that "the British and Americans, through the hands of soldiers trained in colonial schools, are once again directly interfering to prevent the revolution from advancing. After the murder of Lumumba and the intervention in Stanleyville, now it is the turn of Ghana."

    非洲人民必须警惕帝国主义卷土重来的阴谋
    刚果（布）执政党中央和妇女工会组织谴责帝国主义策划加纳军事政变
    索马里和赞比亚反对加纳军政权　阿外长谴责帝国主义危害非洲独立
    新华社布拉柴维尔六日电　刚果（布）全国革命运动中央委员会五日发表声明，号召刚果（布）人民“支持非洲的进步力量，特别是英勇的加纳人民”，并呼吁非洲人民“对殖民主义卷土重来的阴谋活动加倍提高警惕”。
    声明说，刚果（布）全国革命运动中央委员会五日在布拉柴维尔举行的全体会议上，研究了最近在加纳发生的反对恩克鲁玛的军事政变和由此而造成的非洲局势。
    声明“强烈谴责帝国主义干涉非洲国家的内部事务，强烈谴责帝国主义国家支持非洲反动派”。
    声明欢呼几内亚总统塞古·杜尔、几内亚民主党政治局和几内亚人民给予恩克鲁玛的支持。
    声明说，全国革命运动批准刚果（布）政府关于撤回参加亚的斯亚贝巴非洲统一组织部长理事会会议的刚果（布）代表团的决定。它重申尊重非洲统一组织一九六五年十二月作出的在南罗得西亚问题上同英国断绝外交关系的决定。
    新华社布拉柴维尔五日电　刚果（布）革命妇女联盟四日晚上在这里举行群众集会，强烈谴责帝国主义在加纳策划军事政变和美国侵略越南。
    这次集会是刚果（布）革命妇女联盟成立一周年和国际妇女节庆祝活动的开始。
    妇女组织、工会和全国革命运动的领导人在会上发表了讲话。
    由郭建率领的中国妇女代表团也参加了集会。
    刚果（布）革命妇女联盟第一副主席布安加—塔蒂夫人在会上说：“正当有人大规模地策划政变的大阴谋来阻挡非洲朝着彻底解放和统一的方向迈进的时候，刚果妇女支持同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行顽强斗争的各国妇女。”
    她说：“刚果（布）妇女（举行庆祝活动）的这些日子也是声援加纳兄弟人民的日子”。
    她最后说：“对于我们刚果（布）妇女来说，斗争还只是刚刚开始——因为斗争是长期的——帝国主义者及其走狗应当懂得，非洲，特别是刚果（布）比以往任何时候都更加不可能再度成为殖民地”。
    刚果（布）工会联合会总书记迪亚洛·伊德里萨在讲话中谴责约翰逊政府在所谓“保卫自由”的幌子下加紧侵略越南。他说：“美国人必须滚出越南，让越南人民自己解决自己的事务”。
    他在谴责帝国主义策划加纳军事政变时说：“阿克拉政变向我们指出了帝国主义决心要重新征服非洲，并使非洲成为它的原料贮藏所。帝国主义到处扶植忠于它的政策的傀儡政府来掠夺我们的资源，践踏我们的尊严，破坏我们的潜力和灌输帝国主义的思想”。
    他表示刚果（布）工人完全和无条件地支持加纳人民，并号召人民武装动员起来，以组成一条反对帝国主义、保卫非洲的万里长城。
    刚果（布）全国革命运动第一书记努马扎莱在谈到加纳的军事政变时鼓励男女党员进一步动员起来以对付帝国主义。
    新华社六日讯　摩加迪沙消息：据《索马里之声报》二月二十七日报道，索马里外交部发表声明，对加纳政变表示遗憾，并对恩克鲁玛总统致力于非洲团结表示尊敬。
    索马里外交部长杜阿莱说，恩克鲁玛总统是非洲统一的鼓舞者。杜阿莱对阿克拉发生的事件表示遗憾。杜阿莱在出席非洲统一组织部长理事会会议时对记者说，“从一开始我们就反对加纳军政权在这里的代表资格。”
    据索马里民主联盟机关报《人民联盟》三月一日报道，索马里民主联盟打电报给非洲统一组织部长理事会，“谴责最近在加纳发生的可耻的军事叛乱，支持恩克鲁玛总统的合法政府”。
    电报说：“这次叛乱是帝国主义向爱好和平的非洲国家及其领导人以及非洲解放运动敲起的警钟。如果这些叛乱分子不受到惩罚，这种疾病将会蔓延开来。”电报呼吁非洲国家立即帮助恩克鲁玛，使他能够消灭受美英帝国主义指挥的叛乱分子。
    新华社六日讯　卢萨卡消息：赞比亚政府四日晚宣布召回它驻加纳的高级专员。
    在亚的斯亚贝巴参加非洲统一组织部长理事会会议的赞比亚外交部长卡普韦普韦四日向会议发表一项声明，赞扬恩克鲁玛总统对非洲解放的贡献。他说，目前反对恩克鲁玛的企图使帝国主义、殖民主义和他们的代理人感到高兴。
    新华社六日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚外交部长布特弗利卡三日就加纳军事政变发表声明，谴责帝国主义不择手段危害非洲国家的独立。
    声明说，“在非洲以及世界其它地区的外国干涉正在不断增加，帝国主义所追求的目的仍然是要粉碎非洲各国人民为巩固自身的独立和统一所进行的一切努力。帝国主义在非洲的利益是如此巨大，以至于它不可能自动放弃它们。”
    声明指出，为了保护这些利益，帝国主义就企图在一切地方强迫实行它的政治统治。
    声明说，阿尔及利亚政府不打算干涉那些仅仅同加纳人民有关的事务。“但是，由于目前的事件是帝国主义的阴谋造成的，由于这些事件危害着非洲国家的稳定和独立，阿尔及利亚感到它同这些事件直接有关。”声明强调阿尔及利亚要保持警惕，准备好对付来自帝国主义的任何进攻。
    阿尔及利亚工人总联合会机关刊物《革命和劳动》最近一期发表文章指出，“英国人和美国人借殖民主义学校训练出来的军人之手，再一次进行直接干涉，阻止革命前进。在谋杀卢蒙巴和对斯坦利维尔进行干涉之后，现在轮到加纳这个国家了。”
