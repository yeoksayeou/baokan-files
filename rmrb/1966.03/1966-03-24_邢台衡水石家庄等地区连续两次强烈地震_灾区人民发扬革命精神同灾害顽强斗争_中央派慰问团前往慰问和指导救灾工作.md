    Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd. At 4:11:32 PM and 4:19:32 PM on March 22nd, two consecutive strong earthquakes occurred in Xingtai, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang and other regions of Hebei Province. The magnitudes were 6.7 and 7 respectively, and the epicenter intensities were 9 and 10 degrees respectively.
    These two strong earthquakes, centered in the Xingtai area, affected a wider range than the strong earthquake on March 8th. Some areas in southern and central Hebei Province, some suburban areas of Beijing, and some areas where Hebei Province borders Shandong and Shanxi Provinces were all affected by the earthquake to varying degrees.
    According to reports from our reporters on the scene, many houses collapsed in the epicenter area. However, due to the preventative measures taken by local people, and the fact that people were working in the fields, the number of casualties of people and livestock was lighter than in the strong earthquake on March 8th. Currently, cadres and the masses in the disaster-stricken areas are displaying revolutionary spirit and tenaciously fighting the disasters caused by the earthquake.
    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are extremely concerned about the people affected by the disaster in Xingtai and other regions. On March 23rd, they sent a Central 慰问团 headed by Zeng Shan, member of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to the disaster area to express condolences, convey the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the people affected by the disaster, and guide the disaster relief work.
    Immediately after the earthquake, the Chinese People's Liberation Army dispatched troops and a large number of transport vehicles, departing for the disaster-stricken areas late that night. The PLA troops are now working with the local party and government leading organs to help the disaster-stricken people vigorously carry out rescue and resettlement work.

    邢台衡水石家庄等地区连续两次强烈地震
    灾区人民发扬革命精神同灾害顽强斗争
    中央派慰问团前往慰问和指导救灾工作
    新华社二十三日讯　二十二日下午四时十一分三十二秒和四时十九分三十二秒，河北省邢台、衡水、石家庄等地区连续发生两次强烈地震，震级分别为六点七级和七级，震中烈度分别为九度和十度。
    这两次强烈地震以邢台地区为中心，比三月八日的那次强烈地震波及范围要广，河北省南部和中部的一些地区，北京市部分郊区，以及河北省同山东省、山西省交界的部分地区，都不同程度地受到地震的灾害和影响。
    据本社记者从现场报道，震中地区房屋倒塌较多，由于当地群众采取预防措施，和人们正在田间劳动，人畜伤亡情况比三月八日的强烈地震为轻。现在，受灾地区的干部和群众正发扬革命精神，同地震所造成的灾害进行顽强斗争。
    中共中央和国务院对邢台等地区受灾群众极为关切，已在二十三日派出以中共中央委员、内务部部长曾山为首的中央慰问团，前往灾区进行慰问，转达党中央和毛主席对受灾群众的关怀，并指导救灾工作。
    中国人民解放军在地震发生后立即派出部队，并出动大量运输工具，于当天深夜出发到受灾地区。解放军部队现已协同当地党政领导机关分头帮助受灾群众大力进行救护和安置工作。
