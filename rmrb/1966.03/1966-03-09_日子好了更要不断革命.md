    With Better Days, We Must Continue the Revolution

    Comrade Jiao Yulu, with his fearless revolutionary spirit, relied on the masses and waged a tenacious struggle against the "three scourges," ultimately defeating them and bringing happiness to the 360,000 people of Lankao. In times of difficulty, such a strong revolutionary spirit is essential.

    Then, in areas with relatively good production conditions, is it necessary to promote this strong revolutionary spirit? People's opinions on this issue are not consistent.

    Our county has achieved consecutive bumper harvests in grain and cotton for three years, with both high yields and high production, making a certain contribution to the country. The people's production and living conditions have also greatly improved. However, the "three self" ideologies (complacency, stagnation, and parochial arrogance) are rearing their heads among some cadres. Some people believe that production has reached its peak, "being the only soybean in the sesame seeds – incomparably big," "it's impossible to jump over the pagoda," "it's good enough as it is, we can get by," and "don't be greedy."

    These statements are expressed at the grassroots level, but in essence, they reflect the ideology of the leadership. These problems exist at the lower levels, but their roots extend to the leadership.

    What are the problems in the leadership's ideology? How should we deal with them? Through studying Jiao Yulu, finding gaps, and investigating the reasons, we deeply feel that: First, the leadership's ideology must establish a developmental perspective. Chairman Mao said: "Mankind is constantly developing, and nature is also constantly developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly sum up experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress. The viewpoint of stagnation, the viewpoint of pessimism, the viewpoint of inaction, and the viewpoint of complacency are all wrong." We must repeatedly and deeply study Chairman Mao's instruction. We must seriously address the complacency and stagnation viewpoints among some comrades. First and foremost, the core leadership of the county party committee, the "squad leader," must establish a developmental perspective and arm the entire party with the spirit of continuous revolution.

    Secondly, we must fully recognize the superiority of socialist large-scale agriculture – the people's commune. The people's commune has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of our production. We must use the thinking of socialist large-scale agriculture to overcome the influence of small-peasant economy in our minds. We once had the idea of only seeking stable production and preserving the red flag, which in essence was a reflection of small-peasant thinking in our leadership's minds. The people's commune relies on the people, and the human factor is paramount. We should never be satisfied with the existing level; we should not only focus on adapting to and utilizing nature, but should focus on transforming nature; we should not focus on maintaining the status quo, but should constantly start new undertakings.

    Thirdly, we must deeply understand the spirit of "standing at the mouth of the Yangtze River, looking towards Tiananmen Square; standing on the edge of the Yellow Sea, looking at the whole world." Communists must always have two baselines in their minds: 650 million and 3.2 billion people. Serve the Chinese revolution and serve the world revolution. We should recognize that socialist China bears a major international responsibility to support the revolutionary people of the world. Only when this kind of thinking is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and the people are more broad-minded, will they march forward more proudly.

    Finally, we must further understand the relationship between politics and production, and always put politics first. In recent years, we have relied on holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping the key of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, and achieved consecutive bumper harvests. Now that material wealth has increased, it is even more necessary to put politics first in order to continue the revolution, continue to advance, and achieve higher and higher yields.

    Facts tell us: with better days, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and continue the revolution, continue to advance.

    日子好了更要不断革命
    焦裕禄同志以天不怕、地不怕的大无畏的革命精神，依靠群众，同“三害”作顽强的斗争，终于战胜了“三害”，为兰考三十六万人民造了福。在困难的时候，就必须要有这种坚强的革命精神。
    那么，在生产条件比较好的地方，要不要发扬这种坚强的革命精神？对于这个问题，人们的看法是不一致的。
    我县已经连续三年获得了粮棉双丰收，双高产，对国家作出了一定的贡献，人民的生产、生活条件也大有改善，部分干部中三自思想（骄傲自满、故步自封、夜郎自大）在抬头，有的人认为生产已经到顶，“是芝麻里的黄豆——独大了”，“再也跳不过塔了”，“就这样蛮好，过得去了”，“不要贪心不足了”。
    这些说法表现在基层，实质上是反映了领导思想；这些问题存在于下面，根子却通到领导身上。
    领导思想上问题何在呢？该怎么对待呢？通过学习焦裕禄，找差距，查原因，我们深深感到：首先是领导思想上要树立发展的观点。毛主席说：“人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”对于毛主席的这个指示，要反复深入的学习。对于部分同志中的自满情绪，停止的论点，必须认真加以解决。首先是县委领导核心，“班长”要树立发展的观点，并用不断革命的精神武装全党。
    其次是，充分认识社会主义大农业——人民公社的优越性。人民公社给我们生产的发展开辟了无限广阔的前景。要以社会主义大农业的思想，来克服头脑中的小农经济的影响。我们一度存在过只求稳产、保红旗的思想，这实质上是小农思想在我们领导头脑中的反映。人民公社靠人民，靠人的因素第一。我们应该永远不满足于现有的水平；我们不能只以适应利用自然为主，应该以改造自然为主；不能以守业为主，而要不断创业。
    再次，要深入理解“站在长江口，望到天安门，立足黄海边，放眼全世界”的精神。共产党人，脑子里始终要有两个基数，即：六亿五和三十二亿人民。为中国革命，为世界革命服务。应该认识到社会主义的中国对支援世界革命人民的国际责任重大。只有这种思想愈是深入人心，愈是胸襟开阔，人们才会愈加昂首阔步前进。
    最后，还要进一步认识政治和生产的关系，永远突出政治。近几年来，我们靠高举毛泽东思想红旗，抓住了阶级斗争和两条道路斗争之纲，取得了连年双丰收，现在物质丰富了，更需要突出政治，才能不断革命，不断前进，高产更高产。
    事实告诉我们：日子好了更要听毛主席话，跟共产党走，要不断革命，不断前进。
