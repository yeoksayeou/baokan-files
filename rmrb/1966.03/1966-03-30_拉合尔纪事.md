    Lahore Chronicle

    Not long ago, we had the opportunity to visit Lahore, a historic city in Pakistan.
    Lahore is one of the oldest cities in Pakistan, with a history of nearly two thousand years. It is also the political and cultural center of West Pakistan. The highest administrative leadership organs of West Pakistan are located here, as well as many universities, artistic groups, and the largest museum in Pakistan. Many well-known figures in the cultural circles also reside here.
    Approaching the city, this city located on the northeastern plains of West Pakistan is covered by lush greenery, with tall tropical trees and verdant grasslands everywhere. The red or white national-style buildings scattered among them decorate the city with a special quiet elegance, so it is no wonder that people call it the "Garden City."
    Lahore, because of its long history, has many places of historic interest and still retains many ancient buildings. The famous Badshahi Mosque, the beautiful Shalimar Gardens, the white marble palaces, and the exquisite stone carvings all demonstrate the high level of architecture and artistic talent of the Pakistani working people.
    Lahore is not only beautiful in scenery, but it is especially admired for its glorious history of struggle against colonial rule. Anti-British movements have erupted here many times, becoming the center of the struggle for independence at that time. Many heroic and moving deeds of struggle are still circulating. A Pakistani friend accompanying us on our visit told us that in an anti-British uprising, an anti-British hero named Shalaam was arrested by the British colonial army. The British rulers tried every possible way to force him to reveal the anti-British organization, but they did not succeed. Finally, a British colonial army officer stabbed Shalaam in the leg with a knife, threatening him, but Shalaam was unyielding and was finally beaten to death by the British colonial army. This friend said excitedly that Pakistan's independence was bought with the blood of millions of people. People know how to maintain their independent achievements. People know how to deal with all evil imperialism and colonialism.
    When we visited Lahore Fort, this Pakistani friend also specially guided us to visit a dark house, below which was a tunnel. He told us that the British colonial army had massacred hundreds of anti-British patriots in this tunnel. The house and tunnel were preserved to educate people not to forget the brutality and ferocity of the colonial rulers.
    The people of Lahore, with their glorious fighting traditions, showed even greater heroism during the large-scale armed invasion launched by Indian expansionists against Pakistan last year.
    During the days of resisting Indian aggression, all the residents of this city were mobilized. There was a moving scene of men, women, old and young turning out to fight the enemy together, and the military and civilians united to resist the enemy. Thousands of residents carried spears and sticks on their shoulders, voluntarily rushed to the front lines, and assisted the army in resisting Indian aggression. Many housewives voluntarily signed up to participate in rescue work. A large number of young people actively participated in the National Guard, and many children ran to the transportation arteries to take on the task of maintaining order and checking pedestrians. It was precisely because people had such a high degree of spirit to resist the enemy and defend themselves that the city remained calm and composed even in wartime. The people of Lahore are worthy of being a heroic people, and Lahore is worthy of being a heroic city.
    The people of Lahore have extremely deep feelings of friendship towards the Chinese people.
    Last October 1st, when the Lahore Pakistan-China Friendship Association held a gathering to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, although only 150 invitations were sent out, more than 3,000 people attended, resulting in the hall being packed to capacity, and a large number of people had to stand outside to participate in the gathering. At this celebration, more than a dozen well-known figures from Lahore delivered enthusiastic speeches, and the slogans of Pakistan-China friendship resounded continuously in the hall. A poet even voluntarily stepped onto the podium and recited a poem praising the friendship between China and Pakistan:
      "Who supported us when difficulties came, it is China.
    Who stands at the forefront of the struggle against aggression, it is China.
    China, China, China has won the hearts of the Pakistani people,
    Let the flowers of China-Pakistan friendship bloom everywhere and stay forever young."
    Recently, Mr. Montaz, the secretary of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, recalled the grand occasion of this gathering and said: "Pakistan-China friendship is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and it is by no means an empty word." He told us that more and more people are now asking to join the Pakistan-China Friendship Association. He said humorously that since everyone advocates China-Pakistan friendship, let's count them all as members!

    拉合尔纪事
    不久以前，我们有机会访问了巴基斯坦的历史名城——拉合尔。
    拉合尔是巴基斯坦最古老的城市之一，已有近两千年的历史。它还是西巴基斯坦的政治文化中心。在这里有西巴最高行政领导机关，有许多高等院校、文艺团体和全巴最大的博物馆。不少文化界知名人士，也居住在这里。
    在接近市区的时候，只见这座位于西巴东北部平原上的城市，为一片浓绿所覆盖，到处是高大的热带树木和如茵的草地，加上那些散处其间的红色或白色的民族形式的建筑，把这座城市装饰得特别静雅美丽，无怪人们把它称作“花园城市”了。
    拉合尔因其历史悠久，名胜古迹甚多，至今还保有不少古代建筑。著名的巴德沙希大清真寺、秀丽的夏丽玛花园、白色大理石的宫殿、精致的石雕，所有这些建筑，都表现了巴基斯坦劳动人民的高度建筑水平和艺术才华。
    拉合尔不但风景优美，尤其使人敬仰的是，它具有反对殖民统治的光荣斗争历史。在这里曾经多次爆发过抗英运动，成为当时争取独立斗争的中心。现在还流传着不少可歌可泣的斗争事迹。陪同我们访问的一位巴基斯坦朋友告诉我们，在一次反英起义中，一位叫做沙拉姆的抗英志士被英国殖民军逮捕。英国统治者千方百计逼他供出抗英组织，但都没有得逞，最后英国殖民军的一个军官用一把刀子插在沙拉姆的腿上，威胁他，但沙拉姆威武不屈，最后被英国殖民军活活地打死了。这位朋友激动地说，巴基斯坦的独立，就是这样用千百万人的鲜血换来的，人们知道怎样维护自己的独立成果。人们知道怎样对付万恶的帝国主义和殖民主义。
    在我们参观拉合尔城堡时，这位巴基斯坦朋友还特别引导我们参观了一座阴暗的房子，在这座房子的下面是一个地道。他告诉我们，英国殖民军曾在这个地道里屠杀了上百名抗英志士，这座房子和地道所以保存下来，是为了教育人们不要忘记殖民统治者的残暴和凶恶。
    有着光荣斗争传统的拉合尔人民，在去年印度扩张主义者对巴基斯坦发动大规模武装进攻时表现得更加英勇不屈。
    在抗击印度侵略的日子里，这个城市的居民全部动员起来。出现了男女老少齐出动，军民团结抗敌人的动人景象。成千上万的居民肩扛长矛，手持棍棒，主动奔向前线，协助军队抵抗印度侵略。有不少家庭妇女自动报名参加了救护工作。大批青年踊跃参加了国民自卫队，不少儿童跑到交通要道担负起维持秩序和检查行人的工作。正是因为人们有着这样高度的抗敌御侮精神，虽在战时，这个城市镇定自若。拉合尔人不愧是英雄的人民，拉合尔不愧是一座英雄的城市。
    拉合尔人对中国人有着极为深厚的友好感情。
    去年十月一日，拉合尔巴中友好协会举行集会庆祝中华人民共和国成立十六周年时，虽然只发出请帖一百五十张，但是到会者却达三千多人，结果把集会的大厅挤得水泄不通，大批的人只好站在门外参加集会。在这次庆祝会上，有十多位拉合尔知名人士发表了热情洋溢的讲话，大厅中不断响起巴中友好的口号。一位诗人还自动走上讲台即席朗诵了一首歌颂中巴友谊的诗歌：
      “是谁当困难到来时支持了我们，是中国。
    是谁站在反抗侵略斗争的最前列，是中国。
    中国，中国，中国赢得了巴基斯坦人民的心，
    让巴中友好的花朵到处开放，永葆青春。”最近巴中友协秘书蒙塔兹先生回忆这次集会的盛况时说：“巴中友好深入人心，绝不是一句空话。”他告诉我们，现在要求参加巴中友协组织的人越来越多。他饶有风趣地说，既是人们都主张中巴友好，就把他们都算作会员吧！
