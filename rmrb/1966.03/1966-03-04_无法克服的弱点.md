    Insurmountable Weakness
    He Zhuo
    The United States imperialism faces supply difficulties in its war of aggression against Vietnam, which are becoming more and more serious as it massively increases its troops in South Vietnam.
    This situation is inevitable. The United States is more than ten thousand kilometers away from the South Vietnamese battlefield, and the vast majority of the military supplies needed by the invading forces must be transported from the United States mainland. Not only are transportation tools such as airplanes and ships insufficient, but airports, ports, and docks are also problematic. Before the massive increase in US troops in February of last year, the logistics requirement was 75,000 tons per month, and transportation and supply were already feeling difficult. Now, with more than 210,000 US troops in Vietnam, the monthly logistics requirement has reached 1.2 million tons. How can the US aggressors not be exhausted in terms of transportation and supply?
    Currently, the US authorities have mobilized more than 100 ships and used three-quarters of the US air transport capacity to supply the war of aggression against Vietnam, and they are still unable to meet the needs. Moreover, the lack of ports, airports, and warehouses in South Vietnam has caused congestion of materials and delays in transportation, further exacerbating the crisis in transportation and supply. No wonder the American press is worriedly pointing out that if the United States fights a war in South Vietnam on the scale of the Korean War, "it would stretch the air and sea transport capacity of the United States to a dangerous degree."
    Supply difficulties are an insurmountable strategic weakness of US imperialism. As the saying goes, a long expedition is what strategists fear. Harboring ambitions to dominate the world, US imperialism wants to play the role of "international gendarme" and engage in intervention and aggression everywhere. In order to invade other countries, it is bound to fight far away from its homeland, which inevitably makes its rear far away and its supply lines long. US imperialism is also a believer in the theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war. It cannot fight without modern weapons such as tanks and artillery. The consumption of ammunition and materials by the US invading army is particularly huge, which further increases its supply difficulties. When the invaded country holds back the US aggressors with a protracted people's war, forcing it to invest a large amount of troops, constantly annihilating them, and consuming its strength, this weakness of US imperialism is bound to be further exposed.
    In order to solve the difficulties in transportation and supply in the war of aggression against Vietnam, US imperialism is taking various measures, including requisitioning ships at home, rushing to build ports and airports in South Vietnam, and appointing a deputy commander specifically responsible for logistics supply. However, due to the sharp contradiction between the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of US imperialism and its ambition for aggression, every measure it takes cannot but encounter insurmountable difficulties. That is why an article published not long ago by "U.S. News & World Report" magazine called the difficulty of US military logistics supply "a major problem in the Vietnam War." This is also one of the reasons that determines the inevitable defeat of the US aggressors.

    无法克服的弱点
    何卓
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中供应困难，随着它大量增兵南越而愈形严重。
    这种情况是必然的。美国离南越战场一万多公里，侵略部队所需要的军用物资绝大部分都要从美国本土运去，不仅飞机、轮船等运输工具不敷应用，而且机场、港口、码头也成问题。在去年二月美国大量增兵以前，后勤需要每月七万五千吨，运输供应就已感困难。现在侵越美军增加到了二十一万多，每月后勤需要达到一百二十万吨，美国侵略者在运输供应方面怎能不疲于奔命呢？
    目前，美国当局为了供应侵越战争，已动用了一百多艘船只，并使用了美国空运潜力的四分之三，仍然不能应付需要。而且，由于在南越缺乏港口、机场、仓库，造成物资壅塞、运输拖延，更加重了在运输供应上的危机。怪不得美国报刊忧心忡忡地指出，如果美国在南越打一场朝鲜战争那种规模的仗，“那就会使美国的空运和海运能力吃紧到危险的程度”。
    供应困难，这是美帝国主义在战略上无法克服的战略弱点。俗话说，劳师远征，兵家所忌。美帝国主义怀着独霸世界的野心，要扮演“国际宪兵”的角色，到处进行干涉和侵略。它为了侵略别的国家，必然要远离本土去打仗，结果就不能不使自己的后方离得远远，运输线拉得长长。美帝国主义又是唯武器论者，离开了坦克、大炮等现代化武器是打不了仗的。美国侵略军队弹药物资的消耗量特别巨大，这就更增加了它供应上的困难。当被侵略的国家用持久的人民战争拖住美国侵略者，迫使它投入大量的兵力，不断地予以歼灭，消耗它的力量，美帝国主义的这一弱点就势必更加暴露出来。
    美帝国主义为了解决侵越战争中运输供应的困难，正在采取各种措施，包括在国内征调船只，在南越赶修港口、机场，而且任命了一个副司令专门负责后勤供应的工作。但是，由于美帝国主义存在着人力、物力、财力同侵略野心之间的尖锐矛盾，它采取的每一个措施都不能不遇到难以克服的困难。这就是为什么《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志不久以前发表的一篇文章，把美军后勤供应困难称为“越南战争中的大难题”。这也是注定了美国侵略者必败的原因之一。
