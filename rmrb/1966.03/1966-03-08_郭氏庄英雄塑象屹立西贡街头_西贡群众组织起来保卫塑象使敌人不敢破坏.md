    Guo Shizhuang Heroic Statue Stands Tall in Saigon Streets
    Saigon Masses Organize to Protect the Statue, Deterring Enemy Sabotage
    In the bustling downtown area of Saigon's central market, stands a statue of Guo Shizhuang, a South Vietnamese female hero who sacrificed herself in the anti-American national salvation struggle. People admire and cherish it, while the enemy hates it and wants to destroy it, but it continues to stand tall there.

    This female hero was a brave patriotic young student. In 1963, she led a demonstration against the U.S.-puppet clique, and the enemy opened fire to suppress it, and she bravely sacrificed herself. Her spirit of patriotism, not fearing violence or sacrifice, deeply moved people. To permanently commemorate her, a student from a Saigon art college specially made a statue of her and placed it in the busiest central market in Saigon.

    The U.S.-puppet clique sees this statue as a thorn in their side and always wants to remove it. They often send special agents and hooligans to sabotage it. Therefore, the masses organized to protect the statue and continuously carried out anti-sabotage struggles, and the enemy's conspiracies were constantly shattered. The enemy fears that forcibly destroying it will add fuel to the fire, provoking greater anger and resistance from the masses, which they cannot handle. Therefore, they can do nothing about the statue that has stood there for a long time. To commemorate this female hero, the citizens of Saigon call this busiest "Saigon Central Market" the "Guo Shizhuang Market," and also call the "Yan Hong Park" across from the market "Guo Shizhuang Park."

    郭氏庄英雄塑象屹立西贡街头
    西贡群众组织起来保卫塑象使敌人不敢破坏
    在西贡闹市区的大市场，屹立着一个在抗美救国斗争中牺牲的越南南方女英雄郭氏庄的塑象。人们景仰它、爱护它，而敌人仇恨它，想毁掉它，但是，它一直屹立在那里。
    这位女英雄是一位勇敢的爱国青年学生。一九六三年，有一次她带头举行反对美伪集团的示威游行，敌人开枪镇压，她英勇地牺牲了。她那不畏强暴、不怕牺牲的爱国主义精神，深深感动着人们。为了永久纪念她，西贡一个美术学院的学生，特地做了一个她的塑象，并且把塑象安放在西贡市中心最热闹的大市场上。
    美伪集团把这个塑象看成眼中钉，总想把塑象除掉。他们经常派特务、流氓来破坏。于是群众就组织起来保护塑象，不断地进行反破坏的斗争，敌人的阴谋不断地被粉碎了。敌人怕强行破坏会火上加油，激起群众更大的愤怒和反抗，更无法对付，所以对长期屹立在那里的塑象无可奈何。为了纪念这位女英雄，西贡市民把这个最热闹的“西贡大市场”叫作“郭氏庄市场”，并且还把市场对面的“延鸿公园”叫作“郭氏庄公园”。
