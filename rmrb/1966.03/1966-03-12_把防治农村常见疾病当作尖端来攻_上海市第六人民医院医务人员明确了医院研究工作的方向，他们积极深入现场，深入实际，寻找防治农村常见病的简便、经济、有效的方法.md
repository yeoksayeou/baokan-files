    Treating Common Rural Diseases as Cutting-Edge Research
    Medical personnel from the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital have clarified the direction of the hospital's research work. They actively go deep into the front lines, deep into reality, to find simple, economical, and effective methods for preventing and treating common rural diseases.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th) Medical personnel from the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital are actively researching common rural diseases, striving to provide simple, economical, and effective prevention and treatment methods for the broad masses of peasants.
    Since last year, many medical personnel from this hospital have gone to the countryside to treat peasants, gradually gaining an understanding of common rural diseases and the peasants' demands for medical and health care. However, some medical personnel still believed that popularization and improvement should be divided; going to the countryside could address common diseases, while difficult and rare diseases and cutting-edge medical research should be conducted in the hospital. It was not until they studied the instructions from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on shifting the focus of health work to the countryside that everyone clearly recognized that since the direction of health work is to serve the greatest number of working people, to serve the 500 million peasants, the direction of the hospital's research work should also be mainly oriented towards the majority of working people. Everyone believes that many common rural diseases have not yet been resolved in the world medical community. If we can understand the incidence of common rural diseases and use the technical level, medical equipment, and scientific research conditions of urban hospitals to serve the research of common rural diseases and find some simple, economical, and effective prevention and treatment methods, then we will have conquered the cutting edge.
    Because medical personnel have improved their ideological understanding, many people have attached greater importance to going deep into the front lines and into reality to discover the patterns of common rural diseases in practice and find prevention and treatment methods. They learned from rural Fengxian County that asthma, back pain, and certain gynecological diseases seriously affect the health of peasants. While researching "limb replantation," Deputy Director of Surgery Chen Zhongwei and others included back pain, a common disease, in their scientific research projects. Physician Tang Chenghua previously saw in the emergency room that surgeons used ear acupuncture to treat "stiff neck" (neck pain) with good results. He consulted relevant materials on acupuncture therapy, carefully studied the ear acupuncture points and techniques, and after more than two months of practice, summarized a set of ear acupuncture treatment plans for back pain. Chen Zhongwei and Tang Chenghua went to the countryside twice to introduce this method to health work teams, commune health centers, and county people's hospitals. This method is simple, health workers can master it, and treatment can be carried out at the work site without delaying production, which is very popular among peasants. Chen Yuyan, director of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Li Yishi, deputy director, learned from the health work team that some peasants suffered from hearing loss due to perforated eardrums caused by otitis media. After research, they came up with a simple cauterization patch therapy. Li Yishi brought simple equipment to Jianghai and Xiaotang communes in Fengxian County to treat patients. In just over a week, he performed this repair operation on more than 100 peasants. The peasants happily said that they could hear again for only ten cents.
    Some diseases that were thought to have been resolved in medical literature in the past have not actually been resolved. For example, some common gynecological diseases in rural areas, although they can be treated with surgery, are expensive, painful, and delay production, which is not welcomed by peasants. Hu Zhiyuan, director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sixth People's Hospital, is determined to find a simple, economical, and effective non-surgical treatment method. He led the entire department to screen drugs with the pharmacy, try to produce injections, and carry out treatment in the outpatient clinic. He also requested to go to the countryside twice to observe and summarize the efficacy.

    把防治农村常见疾病当作尖端来攻
    上海市第六人民医院医务人员明确了医院研究工作的方向，他们积极深入现场，深入实际，寻找防治农村常见病的简便、经济、有效的方法
    据新华社上海九日电　上海市第六人民医院医务人员积极研究农村常见疾病，设法为广大农民提供简便、经济、有效的防治方法。
    这个医院去年以来有不少医务人员下乡为农民治病，对农村的常见疾病和农民对医药卫生的要求，逐渐有了认识。但有的医务人员仍认为普及与提高应该分工，下乡可以搞常见疾病，在医院里还是要搞疑难疾病和尖端医学的研究。直到他们学习了党中央和毛主席关于把卫生工作重点放到农村的指示，大家才明确认识到既然卫生工作的方向是为最大多数劳动人民服务，为五亿农民服务，医院研究工作的方向也应该主要是面向大多数劳动人民。大家认为，现在有不少农村常见疾病在世界医学界尚未得到解决，如果能把农村常见疾病的发病情况摸上来，运用城市医院的技术水平、医疗设备和科学研究条件，为农村常见病的研究服务，找到一些简便、经济、有效的防治方法，也就是攻克了尖端。
    由于医务人员提高了思想认识，不少人都更加重视了深入现场，深入实际，在实践中去发现农村常见疾病的规律，找出防治的办法。他们从奉贤县农村了解到哮喘、腰酸背痛以及某些妇科病严重影响农民的健康。外科副主任陈中伟等在研究“断肢再植”的同时，把腰酸背痛这一常见疾病列入了科学研究专题。医师汤成华过去在急诊室看到外科医师用耳针治疗“落枕”（颈项酸痛）效果很好。他翻阅有关针刺疗法的资料，仔细研究了耳针部位与手法，经过两个多月的实践，总结出一套用耳针治疗腰酸背痛的方案。陈中伟和汤成华曾两次下乡向卫生工作队、公社卫生院、县人民医院介绍这个方法。这个方法简便，卫生员也能掌握，而且在劳动现场也可以进行治疗，不耽误生产，很受农民欢迎。耳鼻喉科主任陈玉琰、副主任李伊士从卫生工作队了解到，有些农民因患中耳炎鼓膜穿孔而听力减退，经过研究，想到了一种简便的烧灼贴片疗法。李伊士带了简单的器械到奉贤县江海、萧塘等公社，为病人进行治疗。一个多星期内，他为一百多个农民进行了这种修补手术。农民高兴地说，只花了一角钱，耳朵就听得见了。
    过去有些疾病在医学文献上认为已经解决了的，实际并没有解决。如农村有些妇科常见病，虽然可用手术治疗，但费用贵，痛苦大，耽误生产，农民不欢迎。第六人民医院妇产科主任胡志远决心要寻找一种简便、经济、有效的非手术疗法。他领导全科人员与药房一起筛选药物，试制针剂，并且在门诊开展治疗。他还两次要求下乡观察总结疗效。
