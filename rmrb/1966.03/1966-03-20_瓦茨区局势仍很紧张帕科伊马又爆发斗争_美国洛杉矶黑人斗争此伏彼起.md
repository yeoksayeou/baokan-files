    Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, 18th Dispatch: Following the heroic anti-violent struggle of Black people in the Watts district of Los Angeles, USA, on the 15th, Black people in Pacoima, another district of this city, also rose up on the 18th to resist racial discrimination.
    According to reports, a group of Black youths were standing in front of a white-owned store in Pacoima on the 18th when discriminatory white people tried to drive them away. Enraged, the Black youths attacked the white people's cars with stones and bottles.
    The authorities immediately dispatched a large number of police to the scene to suppress the unrest. However, approximately one hundred Black people persisted in their struggle for five hours. According to reports, one Black youth was arrested.
    After the outbreak of the Black people's anti-violent struggle in Watts on the 15th, the situation there has remained tense for several days, and the Black people's struggle is poised to erupt again at any moment. As of the 17th, armed police were still blockading the affected area. At the same time, the authorities dispatched a large number of state, city, and county officials to "investigate" the cause of the incident. California Governor Brown said uneasily on the same day, when discussing the trend of Black people's struggle: "I think there will be more incidents."

    瓦茨区局势仍很紧张帕科伊马又爆发斗争
    美国洛杉矶黑人斗争此伏彼起
    据新华社十八日讯  洛杉矶消息：继美国洛杉矶市瓦茨区黑人十五日的英勇抗暴斗争之后，这个城市的另一个地区帕科伊马的黑人十八日也奋起反抗种族歧视。
    据报道，帕科伊马的一群黑人青年十八日在一家白人商店门口停留，这时歧视他们的白人硬要把他们赶走。被激怒的黑人青年便用石头和瓶子袭击了白人的汽车。
    当局立刻派出大批警察到出事地点进行镇压，但是前后有大约一百名黑人坚持了五个小时的斗争。据报道，一个黑人青年被逮捕。
    在瓦茨区十五日爆发了黑人的抗暴斗争以后，几天来那里的局势一直紧张，黑人斗争随时都有一触再发之势。到十七日，武装警察仍然封锁着出事地区，同时当局派出大批州、市、县的官员“调查”出事原因。加利福尼亚州州长布朗同一天在谈到黑人斗争的趋势时不安地说：“我想还会发生事件”。
