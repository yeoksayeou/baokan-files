Editor's Note: What is the key to highlighting politics? Today's report on "How the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee Highlights Politics in Leading the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign" clearly raises this question.

Currently, in discussions about the relationship between politics and professional work in various regions, there is a relatively common view that the failure to highlight politics is the problem of administrative cadres, the problem of lower levels, or the problem of others. However, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee does not see it that way. They put forward with a serious spirit of self-criticism that this is because the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee has not highlighted politics. They started with the ideological revolutionization of their own leadership, opened their doors for inspection, promoted democracy, and listened to criticisms from enterprises. After conducting the inspection, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee immediately took action, creatively studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, concentrated its efforts, highlighted politics, solved the directional problems of the increase production and practice economy campaign, and grasped revolution to promote production. Due to the clarity of direction and the determination, the Municipal Party Committee powerfully led the city's industrial enterprises, setting off a mass movement to acknowledge backwardness, change backwardness, catch up quickly, and strive to surpass.

Highlighting politics is primarily the responsibility of Party committees at all levels. Is there anyone who still doesn't believe it? Reading this report on Shenyang's highlighting of politics and finding the problems in your department or unit where politics has not been highlighted will be very beneficial.

Catch Up Quickly and Strive to Surpass
-- How the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee Highlights Politics in Leading the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a battle call to hundreds of thousands of workers in the city: Uncover the lid on production backwardness! The leading comrades of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee said: The working class of Shenyang is not backward; however, the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee is backward, and the industrial production of Shenyang is backward. Acknowledging backwardness, this thunderclap roused the revolutionary spirit of hundreds of thousands of employees in Shenyang, and all industrial enterprises are following the Chinese-style path of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought, taking Daqing as an example, taking Jinzhou as an example, greatly finding shortcomings, and greatly uncovering backwardness. Acknowledging backwardness but refusing to lag behind is a gratifying starting point for Shenyang's industrial production to catch up quickly and strive to surpass advanced levels, and at the same time, it has opened a breakthrough for how to highlight politics in leading industrial production.

Where to Open the Breakthrough

When many leading comrades of Party committees talk about the issue of highlighting politics, they often feel that there are many problems and don't know where to start. It cannot be denied that to truly highlight politics, there are issues of understanding and issues of methods; however, there is also a very big problem, which is: the Party committee leadership itself must first highlight politics and not put itself outside the circle of highlighting politics, thinking that only lower levels should highlight politics, or only administrative cadres should highlight politics. In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee itself first stood inside the circle of highlighting politics, starting with the ideological revolutionization of itself, setting an example for how industrial enterprises in the city should highlight politics. They began by examining the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, spending a considerable amount of time carefully reading the relevant instructions from the Central Committee and the relevant works of Chairman Mao, examining the leadership ideology and style politically and ideologically; and instead of conducting closed-door inspections, they convened a conference of more than 1,000 leading cadres from enterprises across the city, fully promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up.

Shenyang's industrial production has achieved great results. Over the past ten years, it has produced cadres, machines, and technology, vigorously supporting the development of industrial and agricultural production throughout the country, and providing important equipment and technical forces for many emerging industries in our country. In the past, the comrades in Shenyang were satisfied with these achievements and unconsciously became complacent. This time, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee opened its eyes to look at the overall situation and began to see that the quality of Shenyang's products was lagging behind, and the development of new products and new technologies was slow. The root cause of backwardness in production is that the leadership ideology lags behind the development of the revolutionary situation, the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought is not deep, it is not used flexibly, less attention is paid to politics, and more attention is paid to professional work; the "foreign frameworks" and various outdated rules and regulations that hinder production development have not been broken down enough; and there are negative factors in the mental state such as being satisfied with the status quo and being content to be in the middle. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee acknowledges backwardness based on the high standards of Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, takes Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, starting with highlighting politics to catch up quickly, and striving to quickly change the backward situation.

Highlighting politics, starting from the Municipal Party Committee itself, is a powerful impetus for enterprises to highlight politics. This year, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee no longer spends a lot of energy sitting in the office grasping indicators and urging progress as it did in the past, but instead grasps revolution to promote production, concentrating its efforts to solve the political direction problems of the campaign, and grasping the issues of enterprises highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and inspection teams often go deep into the grassroots, summarize experiences, and raise questions, earnestly strengthening leadership from a political and ideological perspective. Each enterprise also starts from its own reality, first solving the problem of the leading core highlighting politics. In this way, this year's increase production and practice economy campaign is not just a major inspection of waste and a major inspection of gaps in production technology, but also a major inspection of the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and a major inspection of the guiding ideology and mental state of leaders at all levels.

For the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, leading enterprises to consciously highlight politics is only the beginning, and leading the highlighting of politics cannot replace the highlighting of politics by lower levels. To truly achieve political command in production, the leadership still needs to do a lot of hard work.

What is the Standard for Measuring Work

In the increase production and practice economy campaign, what standard is used to measure the work of each unit? Shenyang has undergone a clear change this year, that is, first looking at whether politics commands production, rather than simply looking at indicators, measures, or progress. We saw this change at a recent conference convened by the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee to exchange experiences in the increase production and practice economy campaign.

There is a non-ferrous metal processing plant in Shenyang, and the progress of this year's increase production and practice economy campaign is not slow. The Party committee mobilized the masses to expose waste in equipment, materials, and funds, found gaps in backward economic and technical indicators, the employees put forward a large number of opinions and suggestions, and various plans and indicators have been discussed and formulated. According to the general standards of previous years, such a situation is completely acceptable; however, at this conference, the Municipal Party Committee inspection team raised objections, believing that the factory's political and ideological work was not specific enough, and the increase production and practice economy campaign could not be considered truly implemented. Why did this factory become "unacceptable"?

The problem is that the standard of "acceptable" has been raised this year at the Municipal Party Committee. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee is no longer satisfied with the situation of discussing production in isolation from production as it was in the past. After listening to the factory's report, they immediately sent an inspection team to inspect the factory's campaign and found that the factory's Party committee did not fully understand the active thinking in the campaign and did not figure out what problems existed in highlighting politics. Strictly speaking, in highlighting politics, the Party committee only went through the motions without solving any problems, and the rectification work was therefore done poorly. The inspection team helped the factory's Party committee realize that the campaign could not remain at the old standard of discussing production in isolation from production by analyzing the ideological situation of the factory's employees and analyzing the implementation of the rectification work. The factory's Party committee accepted the inspection team's opinions and resolved to make up for this important lesson in the campaign.

In the past, when carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign, the leading organs always verbally emphasized that politics should be in command. However, when inspecting the work, the leadership only paid attention to production indicators and measures. If there were problems in production, the higher authorities would generally not let it "pass"; going through the motions politically, however, could "pass." Therefore, some comrades regarded production as a "hard task" and politics as a "soft task." This is partly because their own understanding is problematic; and partly because the Party committee leading organs grasp production firmly and grasp politics softly; grasp production seriously and often go through the motions when grasping politics. This year, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee grasped politics firmly and seriously, discovered situations where politics was neglected, conducted specific inspections and provided assistance, and used the problems in one factory's work to educate everyone. The practice of the lower levels treating politics as a "soft task" began to change somewhat.

Highlighting Politics and "Crash" Politics

In the increase production and practice economy campaign, two approaches, highlighting politics and "crash" politics, are constantly struggling. The so-called "crash" politics is to treat politics as a crash task, so that politics is often separated from production and cannot command production.

While convening the conference to exchange experiences in the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee gathered the leading cadres of municipal enterprises to further study Chairman Mao's works and examine the leadership ideology. The problem arose from the struggle between "crash" politics and highlighting politics.

In the initial stage of the campaign, the municipal enterprises studied Chairman Mao's relevant works, uncovered the lid on production struggles, dug up ideological roots, and resolved to learn from the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and Jinzhou. However, when formulating plans for manufacturing new products, many units submitted plans to the city requesting 70 million yuan in investment. The Municipal Party Committee issued a list of Chairman Mao's works, inviting everyone to bring it and the 70 million yuan bill to study and check against each other.

Production cannot be separated from certain material conditions, and when increasing production tasks, one cannot oppose requesting investment in general terms. The problem is that many units requesting investment did not first mobilize the masses to tap internal potential, but instead looked upwards, reaching out to the state as soon as there was a new task. Some units even held the idea of "not losing out," wanting what others wanted. The responsible comrade of the Shenyang Motor Factory talked about their two methods of accounting for a task. This year, the factory's task of producing submersible motors has increased several times. What to do? The factory director led people to the workshop to carefully calculate equipment capacity, calculate man-hour quotas..., and the conclusion was that the state needed to invest 630,000 yuan, increase 12 pieces of equipment, and 50 workers. However, if they waited for the equipment and people to be transferred before starting work, they would not have enough time. After calculating and calculating, the enthusiasm of the cadres and workers was lost. Only then did they realize that this method of accounting was separated from Mao Zedong Thought, did not highlight politics, only saw things and did not see people. Therefore, the factory leadership immediately turned around to mobilize the masses. As a result, 630,000 yuan became 150,000 yuan, and they did it themselves, ensuring the time.

Why did everyone study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought during the ideological mobilization stage of the campaign, but then leave Mao Zedong Thought and forget to highlight politics when solving production problems? A workshop director from the Shenyang Smelting Plant said it well: In the past, everyone talked about highlighting politics, but I said it was "crash" politics, thinking that politics could only be crashed for a while, and when it came to solving production problems, politics should give way. As soon as a production scheduling meeting was held, it was like an "exchange," and everyone argued endlessly. Now, this comrade has changed from a proponent of "crash" politics to a proponent of highlighting politics, studying Chairman Mao's works extensively and grasping good people and good deeds in leading production, and has begun to taste the sweetness of highlighting politics.

Highlighting politics and "crash" politics, a difference of one word, are two different understandings of Mao Zedong Thought and of putting politics in command. Highlighting politics means using Mao Zedong Thought to handle all problems and command all things. All production activities of factories and mines cannot be separated from the command of politics and cannot be separated from the command of Mao Zedong Thought. Separated from Mao Zedong Thought and separated from the politics of the proletariat, production will lose its direction and lose its driving force. "Crash" politics means that politics can only be mobilization reports at meetings, ideological inspections during campaigns, etc. This practice has become commonplace in some units and may play a certain role, but because politics is not always highlighted and politics is not implemented in production, it is not easy to truly become the commander. A responsible comrade of a factory said, we are not good at grasping active thinking in production, not because there is no active thinking in production. At meetings to study production problems, active thinking is simply lively, both correct and incorrect. We often let active thinking trip us up, but we still haven't grasped it. Comrades who practice "crash" politics are exactly like this, often letting active thinking trip them up without understanding how they fell.

The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee seized the "70 million yuan" issue to educate cadres. Many units that proposed 70 million yuan in investment mostly reduced their investment plans realistically after solving ideological problems. This is a good start to truly implementing politics in production. The responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee said: On this issue, habitual forces are very strong, and they are prepared to repeatedly struggle in practical work so that everyone gradually learns to command production and command all professional activities with politics.

Truly Implement the Mass Line to the End

This year, employees saw that leading cadres sincerely and honestly uncovered the lid on backwardness and used Mao Zedong Thought as a command to examine their own thinking, and they were greatly encouraged. They said: "As long as the leadership dares to learn from Daqing, we dare to learn from Wang Tie!" This sentence is worth pondering by enterprise leading cadres. It is not only Daqing that has Wang Tie, as long as there is Daqing-style leadership, Wang Tie will appear everywhere. To learn from Daqing-style leadership, this is not a new issue for many leading cadres; however, it is not easy to truly implement the mass line to the end. In the past, in the increase production and practice economy campaign, employees put forward many rationalization proposals, but often nothing came of them. The masses looked at the leadership, the leadership reached out to the higher authorities, and pinned their hopes on money and materials. As a result, as some workers said, waste is opposed every year, gaps are found every year, and when you open the notebook, it is still those few items. Employees of the Shenyang Smelting Plant demanded that leading cadres thoroughly reverse this situation in this year's increase production and practice economy campaign.

The employees of the Shenyang Smelting Plant have great enthusiasm for learning from Daqing and Jinzhou and have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals, including the long-standing and difficult problem of lead poisoning from smoke and dust. Workers have been raising this issue every year, and the leadership has also thought of many ways. They suggested that the state build sanatoriums for workers, and the factory stipulated that workers have time for recuperation every year. Aren't these measures very good? But workers still give their opinions every year, why? Because a large amount of lead dust flies out in the smoke and dust. This is still an important sign of the enterprise's backwardness. This year, when the workers started to put forward this suggestion, the leadership again handled it according to the old routine and made a plan: it requires 120,000 yuan, 20 to 30 workers, and 17 tons of steel. After the leading cadres consulted with the workers, the workers said: We are revolutionary workers. Revolutionary workers must rely on their own efforts and be able to innovate. They don't want steel, they pick up bricks themselves and use scrap iron drums; they don't want to add people, they do it themselves, using indigenous methods. As a result, it only cost a few thousand yuan to repair the smoke and dust removal pipeline. In this way, not only was the smoke and dust poisoning phenomenon solved, but also a large amount of lead powder was recovered.

Why did the leading cadres only let the masses make suggestions in the past, but not hand these suggestions over to the workers themselves to solve? Here, there is a question of believing in the masses or believing in oneself. Believing in the masses will fully unleash the enthusiasm of the masses to realize their suggestions, which is like the soil is there, and it depends on whether you go to sow. Believing in oneself actually cannot be separated from asking the state for money, people, and materials, or doing some "good deeds" for the masses. This is not a thorough mass viewpoint. The technical director of a factory said with emotion: In the past, I always thought that I believed in the workers, and I accepted the workers' suggestions, and I would solve them. This seems to be relying on the workers, but the problem of worldview is not thoroughly resolved, and it is impossible to thoroughly rely on the masses. The actual situation is also like this, as long as the leadership dares to make revolution, dares to break foreign frameworks, and dares to rely on its own efforts, the masses are relatively easy to mobilize. The reporter visited many factories in Shenyang. The outdoor cold was harsh, but when the felt door curtain of the workshop was lifted, it was a hot and steamy scene. In order to catch up with advanced levels and to overcome the difficulties in the production of certain products urgently needed by the country, some factories have extracted some leading backbones, technicians, and workers to form three-in-one tackling teams. In a tackling group at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, if the Party committee secretary had not introduced him, we would not have imagined that the person covered in grease who was personally operating was the engineer of this group. In another tackling team, the general branch secretary participating in this team said that their members were eleven people. However, there were definitely more than eleven people active in this team at that time. They said: We are fighting a "people's war." Eleven people are the regular "field army," and there are also a large number of technicians and workers who are not separated from production who are the "local troops," "militia," and "guerrilla groups." In their spare time, they come when called and fight when they come, and even come without being called.

Recognizing Conditions, Breaking Frameworks

In this increase production and practice economy campaign, the workers in many factories put forward many suggestions, solved them quickly, solved them well, and solved them more. What is the reason? In the past, a few leading cadres took on all the suggestions put forward by several thousand employees in the factory and then reached out to the higher authorities. This year, several thousand employees in the factory are also "leading cadres"; leading cadres and technicians are also "workers." To solve problems, leading cadres, technicians, and workers are combined, studying Chairman Mao's works together, thinking of ways together, and working together.

Before the increase production and practice economy campaign, some people said: The products produced in Shenyang are all stupid, big, black, and rough, how can they compare with Shanghai?

How was this question raised? In order to learn advanced experience, the Shenyang Municipal Light Industry Bureau sent cadres to Shanghai eight times to study. Every time they arrived in Shanghai, they diligently learned from others. When they returned to their factory, they immediately started to do things according to the methods of Shanghai, and by the time they learned, Shanghai had new and more advanced methods. The workers said that this is called "sitting on a train and holding a whip, the further you chase, the further you get." Before and after this increase production and practice economy campaign, another situation appeared. When manufacturing a new product, the employees of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory not only carefully studied foreign designs, but also dared to break unreasonable foreign frameworks, and in one fell swoop reduced the weight of this product from more than 1,900 kilograms to more than 100 kilograms, the volume was reduced, but the efficiency was improved. The workers praised this as "turning an old cow into an ant."

In some factories in Shenyang, there are products that are "the same for ten years" and "consistent for fifteen years," and there is a phenomenon that new products are not new. Why is this? It is obviously not that the workers lack ambition, but mainly that the leadership's view of conditions lacks a comprehensive perspective, and they do not dare to innovate and do not dare to move forward by leaps and bounds. They use many frameworks to frame themselves: they learn how others do it, they copy what the books stipulate. In short, others take one step, and they follow one step, and slowly they are left behind. After the increase production and practice economy campaign began in Shenyang, they realized that if they did not change this situation and always followed others step by step, they would be in danger of being thrown out of the Chinese-style industrialization path. They revisited the Party's general line for socialist construction and felt that the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to break old frameworks in 1958 was very cordial. They also studied Chairman Mao's teaching of having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, and their revolutionary spirit was greatly invigorated, and the spirit of hard work, diligence, and daring was like a torrent, pushing people forward. "Turning an old cow into an ant" is not a good proof?

To catch up with advanced levels, one must both follow the path that others have already taken and take the path that others have not taken. Whether it is the former or the latter, one must learn from others and also break frameworks. To break frameworks, one must not disregard conditions, but respect conditions in order to change conditions faster. The Dek Instrument Factory, which belongs to Shenyang City, is a small factory with relatively simple equipment, and last year there were only a few bungalows. In the past, when it was said that they wanted to catch up with Shanghai and manufacture level-three precision balances, the employees shook their heads. They said, for many years, they have been "level five," "Shanghai has not done it, how can we do it!" Last December, they studied Chairman Mao's thinking on running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and used simple constant temperature equipment to successfully trial-produce level-two balances. This January, they went further and created level-one precision balances. Why can this small factory take such a big step? The director of this factory said: We want to fight for a breath, fight for the first class, and "climb onto the kang over the stove." How can we "climb onto the kang over the stove"? This is not reckless action that disregards conditions, but is a step-by-step approach. Dek Instrument Factory wanted to create a level-one precision balance, but did not have the corresponding equipment, and the state stipulated that to manufacture balances above level four, it must have constant temperature equipment. Should they first build a constant temperature building, or should they start working first and create simple constant temperature equipment themselves? They adopted the latter method. This is not a simple method problem, but a problem of what path to take. At that time, the debate was very fierce; however, they finally realized that without constant temperature equipment, it would be impossible to trial-produce highly precise balances. However, manufacturing constant temperature equipment does not mean that they must first build a constant temperature building, and it does not mean that without constant temperature equipment, they cannot create it themselves and can only sit and wait for the conditions to mature. Therefore, they resolutely took the road of self-reliance and running factories diligently and thriftily, and achieved remarkable results.

After many factories entered the rectification stage, the employees were very enthusiastic about catching up with advanced levels. On the one hand, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and established lofty ambitions; on the other hand, it asked leaders at all levels to maintain a clear head and regard it as an important aspect of highlighting politics in the increase production and practice economy campaign. To this end, they re-discussed the People's Daily's six editorials on the high tide of industrial production and other relevant documents, and truly combined revolutionary spirit with a realistic scientific attitude, so that the mass movement of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, helping, and surpassing was both vigorous and solid.

### 急起直追　迎头赶上——沈阳市委在领导增产节约运动中是如何突出政治的

专栏：

    编者按：突出政治的关键何在？本报今天关于《沈阳市委在领导增产节约运动中是如何突出政治的》的报道，鲜明地提出了这个问题。
    当前各地关于政治和业务关系的讨论中，有一种比较普遍的看法，就是政治之所以不能突出，是行政干部的问题，是下级的问题，是别人的问题。但是，沈阳市委不这么看。他们以严肃的自我批评精神提出，这是由于市委的领导没有突出政治。他们从自己的领导思想革命化着手，开门检查，发扬民主，听取来自企业的批评。沈阳市委在进行检查之后，立即行动起来，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，集中力量，突出政治，解决增产节约运动的方向问题，抓革命促生产。由于方向明，决心大，市委有力地领导全市的工业企业，掀起一个承认落后、改变落后、急起直追、迎头赶上的群众运动。
    突出政治，首先是各级党委的事。有谁还不相信吗？读一读沈阳市突出政治的这篇报道，找一找本部门、本单位没有突出政治的问题所在，是会大有好处的。
    急起直追　迎头赶上
    ——沈阳市委在领导增产节约运动中是如何突出政治的
    在今年的增产节约运动中，中共沈阳市委向全市数十万工人阶级发出一个战斗的号召：揭生产落后的盖子！沈阳市委领导同志说：沈阳的工人阶级并没有落后；但是，沈阳市委的领导落后了，沈阳市的工业生产落后了。承认落后，这一声春雷振起了沈阳市数十万职工群众的革命精神，所有的工业企业正在按照以毛泽东思想办企业的中国式的道路，以大庆为榜样，以锦州为榜样，大找差距，大揭落后。承认落后而又不甘落后，这是沈阳市的工业生产急起直追、迎头赶上先进水平的一个可喜的起点，同时，也为领导工业生产如何突出政治打开了突破口。
            突破口从哪里打开
    许多党委领导同志，谈起突出政治问题的时候，常常感到问题很多，不知从何着手。不能否认，要真正做到突出政治，有认识问题，有方法问题；但是，还有一个很大的问题，就是：党委领导本身首先要突出政治，而不要把自己放在突出政治的圈子之外，只要下级突出政治，或者只要行政干部突出政治。在今年的增产节约运动中，中共沈阳市委自己首先站在突出政治的圈子里面，从本身的思想革命化开始，为全市工业企业如何突出政治树立榜样。他们从检查市委的领导开始，拿出相当长的时间，认真阅读中央的有关指示和毛主席的有关著作，从政治上、思想上检查领导思想和作风；并且不是关门检查，而是召开全市一千多企业领导干部的大会，充分发扬民主，自下而上地开展批评和自我批评。
    沈阳市的工业生产是有很大成绩的。十多年来，出干部、出机器、出技术，大力支援了全国工农业生产的发展，为我国许多新兴工业提供了重要的设备和技术力量。过去，沈阳的同志们满足于这些成就，不自觉地故步自封起来。这一次，沈阳市委打开眼界看全局，开始看到沈阳市的产品质量落后了，新产品新技术的发展慢了。生产上落后的根源是领导思想落后于革命形势的发展，对毛泽东思想领会不深，用得不活，抓政治少，抓业务多；对妨碍生产发展的“洋框框”和各种清规戒律破除不够；精神状态中有满足现状、甘居中游的消极因素等等。沈阳市委立足于毛泽东思想的高标准上承认落后，同时也以毛泽东思想为指针，从突出政治入手急起直追，力争迅速改变落后面貌。
    突出政治，从市委本身做起，这对企业突出政治是一个有力的推动。今年，沈阳市委不再象过去那样，用很大的精力坐在办公室里抓指标、催进度，而是抓革命促生产，集中力量解决运动的政治方向问题，抓企业突出政治、活学活用毛泽东思想问题。市委的领导同志和检查组经常深入基层，总结经验，提出问题，从政治思想上切实加强领导。各企业也从自己的实际出发，首先解决领导核心突出政治的问题。这样，今年的增产节约运动，就不只是对浪费的大检查、对生产技术差距的大检查，同时也是对活学活用毛泽东思想的大检查，对各级领导的指导思想和精神状态的大检查。
    领导企业自觉地突出政治，对沈阳市委来说，这还只是开始，而且领导突出政治，不能代替下级突出政治，要使大家在生产中真正做到政治挂帅，领导上还需要做许多艰苦的工作。
            衡量工作的标准是什么
    在增产节约运动中，用什么标准来衡量各个单位的工作，沈阳市今年有了一个明显的变化，那就是首先看政治是否统帅了生产，而不是单纯地看指标，措施，或者进度。在沈阳市委最近召开的一个交流增产节约运动经验的大会上，我们看到了这种变化。
    沈阳市有一个有色金属加工厂，今年增产节约运动的进度并不慢。党委发动群众揭发了设备、材料、资金各方面的浪费现象，找了经济技术指标落后的差距，职工群众提出了大量的意见和建议，各种计划指标已经讨论制定。按照往年一般的标准，象这样的情况是完全可以过得去的；但是，在这次大会上，市委检查组却提出了意见，认为这个工厂对政治思想工作抓得不具体，增产节约运动不能算真正落实。为什么这个厂成了“过不去”的呢？
    问题在于今年市委那里“过得去”的标准提高了。沈阳市委不再象过去那样满足于就生产论生产的状况。他们听了这个厂的汇报以后，马上派出检查组对这个厂的运动进行检查，发现这个厂的党委对于运动中的活思想并不完全了解，没有弄清楚在突出政治方面究竟存在什么问题。严格地说，在突出政治方面，党委只是走了个过场，而并没有解决什么问题，整改工作因而也做得较差。检查组从分析厂里职工的思想情况、从分析整改工作的落实状况中，帮助厂党委认识到运动不能停留在就生产论生产的老标准上。这个厂的党委接受了检查组的意见，决心在运动中补上这重要的一课。
    过去，开展增产节约运动，领导机关口头上也总是强调要政治挂帅。但是，在检查工作的时候，领导上重视的却只是生产的指标、措施。在生产方面有问题，上级一般是不会让“过得去”的；政治上走走过场，却是可以“过得去”的。所以，有些同志把生产当成“硬任务”，把政治看成“软任务”。这一方面是因为他们自己的认识有问题；一方面也因为党委领导机关抓生产抓得硬，抓政治抓得软；抓生产是认真的，抓政治则往往走过场。今年沈阳市委对政治抓得硬，抓得认真，发现了忽视政治的情况，就具体地进行检查和帮助，借一个厂工作中的问题使大家受教育，下边把政治当“软任务”的作法就开始有所改变。
          突出政治和“突击”政治
    在增产节约运动中，突出政治和“突击”政治两种作法不断发生斗争。所谓“突击”政治，就是把政治当做一种突击任务，使政治经常游离于生产之外，而不能统帅生产。
    在召开交流增产节约运动经验大会的同时，沈阳市委把市属企业的领导干部集中起来，进一步学习毛主席著作，检查领导思想。问题就是从“突击”政治和突出政治的斗争引起的。
    市属企业在运动开始阶段，学习了毛主席有关的著作，揭了生产斗争的盖子，挖了思想根源，决心学习大庆和锦州的革命精神。可是，在拟定制造新产品计划的时候，许多单位却向市里提出了七千万元投资的计划。市委开出一个毛主席著作的目录，请大家带上它和七千万元的账单，学习对号。
    搞生产，离不开一定的物质条件，在增加生产任务的时候，不能笼统地反对要求投资。问题在于要求投资的许多单位，并没有首先发动群众挖掘内部的潜力，而是眼睛向上，一有新任务，就向国家伸手，有些单位甚至抱着“不吃亏”的想法，看见别人要，自己也要。沈阳电机厂的负责同志谈了他们对一项任务的两种算账法。今年，电机厂生产潜油电机的任务增加了几倍。怎么办？厂长带人下车间仔仔细细地算设备能力、算工时定额……，结论是要国家投资六十三万元、增加十二台设备和五十名工人。可是，要等设备和人调齐再干，时间就来不及。算来算去，把干部和工人的积极性都算没了。这时候才觉察到这种算账法是离开了毛泽东思想，是没有突出政治，只看到物，而没看到人。于是，厂的领导马上掉转头来发动群众，结果，六十三万变成了十五万，而且，自己动手，时间有了保证。
    为什么在运动的思想发动阶段，大家学毛主席著作、用毛泽东思想，而到了解决生产问题的时候，又离开了毛泽东思想，忘掉了突出政治呢？沈阳冶炼厂的一位车间主任说得好：过去，大家说突出政治，我却说是“突击”政治，以为政治只能突击一阵子，到了解决生产问题的时候，就叫政治让路。一开生产调度会，就象“交易所”，大家争吵不休。现在，这位同志已经从“突击”政治论者变成突出政治论者，在领导生产中大学毛主席著作，大抓好人好事，开始尝到了突出政治的甜头。
    突出政治和“突击”政治，一字之差，却是对于毛泽东思想、对于政治挂帅的两种不同的理解。突出政治，就是用毛泽东思想处理一切问题，统帅一切事物。厂矿企业的一切生产活动都不能离开政治的统帅，不能离开毛泽东思想统帅。离开了毛泽东思想，离开了无产阶级的政治，生产就会迷失方向，失掉动力。“突击”政治，政治就只能是大会上的动员报告，运动中的思想检查等等。这种作法，在有些单位已经习以为常，也可能起一定的作用，但是，因为没有经常突出政治，政治落实不到生产中去，也就不容易真正成为统帅。有一位工厂的负责同志说，我们不善于在生产中抓活思想，并不是生产中没有活思想。研究生产问题的会议上，活思想简直是活蹦乱跳，正确的不正确的都有。我们却常常是让活思想绊个跟斗，却还没有抓住它。“突击”政治的同志正是这样，经常让活思想绊了跟斗，而还不明白跟斗是怎么跌的。
    沈阳市委抓住了“七千万元”这个问题教育干部。提出七千万元投资的许多单位，在解决了思想问题以后，大多实事求是地削减了投资计划。这是使政治真正落实于生产的一个良好的开始。市委的负责同志说：在这个问题上，习惯势力是很大的，他们准备在实际工作中反复斗争，使大家逐步学会以政治统帅生产，统帅一切业务活动。
          把群众路线真正贯彻到底
    今年，职工群众看到领导干部真心诚意地揭落后盖子，用毛泽东思想挂帅检查自己的思想，群情振奋。他们说：“只要领导敢学大庆，我们就敢学王铁人！”这句话很值得企业领导干部深思。不是只有大庆才有王铁人，只要有大庆式的领导，到处都会出现王铁人。要学大庆式的领导，这对许多领导干部来说，不是新鲜问题；但是，要把群众路线真正贯彻到底，却不是很容易的。过去，在增产节约运动中，职工提了不少合理化建议，常常没有下文。群众看领导，领导向上级伸手，寄希望于钱和物，结果正如有些工人所说的那样：浪费年年反，差距年年找，翻开笔记本，还是那几条。沈阳冶炼厂职工在今年的增产节约运动中，要求领导干部把这种状况彻底扭转过来。
    沈阳冶炼厂的职工，对学大庆、学锦州的干劲很大，提出了上千条的合理化建议，其中也包括了烟尘含铅中毒的老大难问题。工人年年提这个问题，领导上也想了很多办法。他们建议国家给工人修了休养所，厂里又规定工人每年有疗养的时间。这些措施不是很好吗？但是工人还年年提意见，为什么？因为工人的职业病虽然大大减少了，但是烟尘中大量的铅末飞扬掉了。这依然是企业落后的一个重要标志。今年，工人开始提出这个建议的时候，领导上又按老套套办事，做了一个计划：需要十二万元，二十到三十个工人，十七吨钢材。领导干部和工人一商量，工人说：我们是革命的工人。革命的工人，就要自力更生，就能革新。他们不要钢材，自己捡砖块，利用废铁桶；不要添人，自己动手，土法上马。结果，只花了几千元，就修好了排烟尘管道。这样，不仅解决了烟尘中毒现象，还回收了大量的铅粉。
    为什么领导干部过去只让群众提建议，却不把这些建议交给工人自己去解决呢？这里有一个相信群众，还是相信自己的问题。相信群众，群众实现建议的积极性就会充分发挥出来，这就好象土壤摆在那里，就看你去不去播种。相信自己，实际上还是离不开向国家要钱、要人、要材料，或者为群众做点“好事”。这不是彻底的群众观点。一个厂的技术总负责人感慨地说：过去总认为自己是相信工人的，接受了工人的建议，我来解决。这样似乎是依靠了工人，实际上世界观的问题不彻底解决，就不可能彻底依靠群众。实际情况也是如此，只要领导敢革命，敢破洋框框，敢自力更生，群众是比较容易发动起来的。记者访问了沈阳市的许多工厂。室外严寒逼人，掀开车间的毡门帘，却是一片热气腾腾的景象。为了赶超先进水平，为了攻破国家急需的某些产品生产中的难关，一些工厂抽出一部分领导骨干、技术人员和工人，组成三结合的攻关队。在沈阳水泵厂的一个攻关小组里，如果不是党委书记介绍，我们怎么也想象不出那位满身油腻亲自进行操作的，就是这个小组的工程师。在另一个攻关队里，参加这个队的总支书记说，他们的成员是十一人。可是，当时在这个队里活动的决不是十一人。他们说：咱们打的是“人民战争”，十一个人是正规的“野战军”，另外还有大量不脱离生产的技术人员和工人是“地方部队”、“民兵”、“游击小组”。在业余时间，他们召之即来、来之即战，甚至不召也来。
            承认条件，打破框框
    在这次增产节约运动中，许多厂的工人提出的建议多，解决得快，解决得好，解决得多。原因在哪里呢？过去是几个领导干部把全厂几千职工提出的建议，全包下来，然后向上伸手。今年全厂几千职工同时也是“领导干部”；领导干部、技术人员同时也是“工人”。解决问题，是领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合，一起学毛主席著作，一起想办法，一起动手。
    在增产节约运动以前，有人说：咱们沈阳出的产品，尽是些傻大黑粗，那能比得过上海呢？
    这个问题是怎样提起的呢？沈阳市轻工业局为了学习先进经验，曾八次派了干部到上海学习。每一次到了上海，他们都是勤勤恳恳地向人家学。回到本厂，他们立即开始照上海的办法干，等他们学会了，上海又出现了更先进的作法。工人说，这叫做“坐火车拿鞭子，越赶越远。”在这次增产节约运动的前后，出现了另外一种情况。沈阳水泵厂的职工，在制造一种新产品中，既认真研究了国外设计，又敢破不合理的洋框框，一举把这种产品的体重由一千九百多公斤，改成一百多公斤，体积缩小了，效能反而提高了。工人称赞这是“老牛变蚂蚁”。
    在沈阳市的一些工厂里，出现了“十年如一日”、“十五年一贯制”的产品，出现了新产品不新的现象，这是为什么？是工人缺乏雄心壮志吗？显然不是，主要是领导思想上对条件的看法，缺乏全面的观点，不敢创新，不敢大踏步前进。自己用许多框框把自己框起来：人家怎么做的，自己就怎样学；书上怎么规定的，自己就照样抄。总之，人家走一步，自己就跟一步，慢慢地就被甩到后面去了。在沈阳市增产节约运动开始以后，他们认识到再不改变这种状况，老是跟在别人后面亦步亦趋，就有被从中国式的工业化的道路上抛出去的危险。他们重温了党的社会主义建设总路线，感到一九五八年那种敢想敢干、敢于突破老框框的革命精神，非常亲切。又学习了毛主席有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进的教导，革命精神大振，干劲、钻劲和闯劲就象一股激流，把人们推向前进。“老牛变蚂蚁”，不就是很好的证明吗？
    赶超先进水平，既要走别人已经走过的道路，又要走别人没有走过的道路。不管是前者，还是后者，都要学习别人，也需要打破框框。要破框框，不是不顾条件，而是要尊重条件，才能更快地改变条件。沈阳市属德克仪器厂是一个小厂，设备比较简陋，去年还只有几间平房。过去一说要赶上海，要制造三级精度的天平，职工们就摇头。他们说，多少年来都是“老五级”，“上海都没有干过，咱们怎能干呢！”去年十二月，他们学习了毛主席勤俭办企业的思想，用简易的恒温设备，硬是试制成功了二级的天平，今年一月更上一层楼，又造出了一级精度的天平。为什么这个小厂能迈出这样大的步子呢？这个厂的厂长说：我们要争口气，争一流，要“隔着锅台上炕”。怎么才能“隔着锅台上炕”呢？这不是不顾条件的蛮干，而是脚踏实地一步一步走出来的。德克仪器厂要创造一级精度的天平，又没有相适应的设备，而国家规定制造四级以上的天平，必须要有恒温设备。是先盖恒温大楼，还是先干起来，自己动手创造简易的恒温设备？他们采取了后面一种方法。这不是一个简单的方法问题，而是走什么道路的问题。当时，争论是很厉害的；但是，他们终于认识到没有恒温设备，要试制精密度很高的天平，是不行的。可是，制造恒温设备不等于要先盖恒温大楼，更不等于说，没有恒温设备，就不能自己创造，只能坐等条件成熟。于是，他们坚决走自力更生、勤俭办厂的道路，取得了显著的成果。
    在许多工厂进入整改阶段以后，职工赶超先进水平的劲头很大，沈阳市委一方面大鼓群众的革命干劲，树立雄心壮志；另一方面又要各级领导保持清醒头脑，把它当作增产节约运动中突出政治的一个重要方面。为此，又重新讨论了《人民日报》六论工业生产高潮的社论和其他有关文件，真正把革命精神和求实的科学态度结合起来，使比学赶帮超的群众运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
