    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd dispatch from Washington: US President Johnson reiterated on the 1st the policy of the big stick and the carrot, attempting to use so-called "resolute combat" and "generous aid" to make the Vietnamese people stop their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.
    At the inauguration ceremony for the new head of the US "Peace Corps," Vaughn, held at the White House, Johnson delivered a speech filled with lies and fallacies. He shamelessly talked about the so-called "revolution of peaceful change," and said that "our purpose there (South Vietnam) is to give peaceful change a real chance to succeed."
    He said, "Finding peace requires courage and skill"; carrying out "peaceful change" requires "soldiers," and also "peace corps members."
    This chieftain of US imperialism once again waved his carrot in his speech, saying that the United States agreed to hold so-called "free elections" in South Vietnam, and then further hold a plebiscite in the whole of Vietnam on "major issues of unification and national destiny." He also said that once "peace" arrives, "then, just as we must be resolute in war, we must be generous in aid in peace." "We will participate in a large-scale effort to carry out reconstruction and development work open to everyone, including North Vietnam."
    On the same day, Johnson also indicated in a letter to Congress that he would continue to use the United Nations, this tool of the United States, to serve the US government's policy of aggression against Vietnam. He said, "Although Hanoi and Beijing refuse UN involvement, the UN should obviously still be concerned about the Vietnam War."

    约翰逊叫嚷要继续搞反革命两手政策
    仍将利用联合国来为美国政府侵越政策服务
    据新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊一日重申大棒加胡萝卜的政策，妄图以所谓“坚决的战斗”和“慷慨的援助”使越南人民停止抗美救国斗争。
    在白宫举行的美国“和平队”新负责人沃恩的就职仪式上，约翰逊发表了一篇充满谎言和谬论的讲话。他厚颜无耻地大谈什么“和平变革的革命”，并且说“我们在那里（南越）的目的是使和平变革有得到成功的真正机会”。
    他说，“找寻和平需要勇气和技巧”；进行“和平变革”需要“士兵”，也需要“和平队员”。
    这个美帝国主义的头子在讲话中再次摇晃他的胡萝卜，说什么美国同意在南越举行所谓“自由选举”，然后进一步在全越南就“统一和国家命运的重大问题”举行公民投票。他又说，一旦“和平”到来，“那时正如我们在战争中必须坚决一样，我们在和平中必须慷慨援助”。“我们将参加进行向包括北越在内的一切人开放的复兴和发展工作的大规模努力”。
    约翰逊同一天还在给国会的一封信里表示要继续利用联合国这个美国的工具来为美国政府的侵越政策服务。他说，
  “尽管河内和北京拒绝联合国介入，联合国显然还是应该关心越南战争。”
