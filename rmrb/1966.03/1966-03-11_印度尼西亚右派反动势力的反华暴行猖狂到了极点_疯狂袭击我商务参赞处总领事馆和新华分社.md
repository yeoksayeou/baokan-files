    Indonesian Right-Wing Reactionary Forces' Anti-China Atrocities Reach Extremes
    Frenziedly Attack Our Commercial Counselor's Office, Consulate General, and Xinhua Branch
    Savagely Injure Thirty of Our Diplomatic Officials, Consular Officials, and Other Staff Members, and Carry Out Extremely Serious Destruction and Looting
    Our Embassy and Xinhua News Agency Branch Issue Strongest Protests to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and Information Bureau Respectively
    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th Dispatch from Jakarta: Several hundred rioters organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces attacked the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch of the People's Republic of China on the morning of the 9th. In broad daylight, the rioters scaled the courtyard walls and broke into the Jakarta branch compound, injuring five Chinese reporters and staff members, wantonly destroying and setting fire to the Jakarta branch's offices and vehicles, causing severe damage.
    This barbaric attack by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces was a premeditated action. In recent months, newspapers controlled by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, in their anti-China clamor, have been relentlessly attacking Xinhua News Agency and Radio Beijing.
    At 11:00 AM on the 9th, several hundred rioters organized by right-wing reactionary forces arrived in trucks in front of the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch. These rioters, armed with iron bars, wooden sticks, daggers, stones, and incendiary devices, got out of the trucks, shouting anti-China slogans such as "Crush the People's Republic of China," and yelling, "Open the door, we have weapons, if you don't open the door, we'll kill you all." They immediately scaled the courtyard walls, smashed open the front yard gate, and while cutting telephone and doorbell lines, rushed to the offices and smashed office doors and windows. Some of the rioters climbed over the iron gate on the left side of the office, broke into the garage, pushed a car out and overturned it, setting it on fire, smashing all the glass windows of another car, and destroying the garage. After surrounding the branch's offices from the front, back, and left sides, the rioters threw stones into the building, attacking the branch's reporters and staff, smashing doors, windows, and office equipment. The rioters even threw Molotov cocktails onto the roof of the office, setting the office on fire.
    During the rioters' wanton acts of violence, Xinhua reporter Li Ruifeng's head was broken by a stone thrown by the rioters, and his eyes were swollen; Xinhua staff member Qiu Guowu was attacked with stones while climbing onto the roof to put out the fire, causing him to fall from the roof and suffer fractures. Xinhua reporters Zhang Haitao, Tan Dongbai, and one staff member were also injured.
    The attack on the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch lasted for an hour. Indonesian military police and the Jakarta Police Department fire brigade did not arrive on the scene until half an hour after the rioters began their violence.
    After the atrocity, the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch sent a representative to meet with Indonesian Foreign Ministry Information Bureau Director Aratas, and lodged a strong protest with him.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th Dispatch from Jakarta: Following their organization of rioters to attack the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch of the People's Republic of China on the 9th, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces organized two groups of rioters again on the morning of the 10th, openly attacking the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia and the Consulate General of China in Jakarta, causing extremely serious incidents.
    According to initial reports received from Jakarta, at 6:45 AM on the 10th, several hundred rioters armed with iron bars, wooden sticks, daggers, and stones, arrived in trucks in front of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta. After the rioters used trucks to smash open the gate of the Consulate General, they used a crane to destroy the courtyard wall. Some of the rioters climbed onto the roof from the crane's boom, broke into the inner courtyard and opened the second door. About two to three hundred rioters armed with weapons then swarmed into the inner courtyard, beating anyone they saw and smashing everything in sight. They broke down doors and windows and entered offices and bedrooms, carrying out thorough destruction, stealing documents and staff members' clothing, smashing internal furniture, televisions, refrigerators, etc., and destroying and looting all private radios and cameras. The rioters also stole the Chinese national flag, the national emblem, and the Consulate General's brass plate, as well as a car. Consul Ma Dengjie, Vice-Consul Li Huiqing, and eight staff members were injured, three of whom were seriously injured. The rioters' attack and destruction lasted for about half an hour. Only a few police officers arrived on the scene when the rioters finished their destruction and left the Consulate General's inner courtyard.
    At 7:00 AM on the 10th, several hundred more rioters attacked the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. The rioters openly broke through the gate of the Commercial Counselor's Office, pushed down the courtyard wall, rushed into the inner courtyard, and injured fifteen diplomatic officials and staff members, including Commercial Counselor Wang Bin, six of whom were seriously injured. The rioters stole the Commercial Counselor's Office's brass plate, stole and burned office documents and archives, and frantically destroyed offices and dormitories. The rioters took the opportunity to loot wildly, stealing office typewriters, computers, and samples from the warehouse, stealing or destroying tape recorders, radios, cameras, and all clothing in the staff members' dormitories, even stealing suitcases. The rioters also stole one car, and burned two cars on the spot, and smashed two cars. The atrocity lasted for two and a half hours.
    The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged the strongest protests with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry regarding these serious incidents, which disregard the basic norms of international relations and barbarically violate the privileges of Chinese embassies and consulates and the personal safety of Chinese embassy and consulate personnel.

    疯狂袭击我商务参赞处总领事馆和新华分社
    野蛮打伤我外交官员领事官员和其他工作人员三十人并进行极严重破坏和抢劫
    我国大使馆和新华社分社分别向印度尼西亚外交部、新闻司提出最强烈的抗议
    新华社十日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒数百人，在九日上午袭击了中国国家通讯社新华社雅加达分社。暴徒们在光天化日之下翻越院墙闯入雅加达分社院内，打伤中国记者和工作人员五人，恣意破坏并纵火焚烧雅加达分社的办公处所和汽车，造成了严重的破坏。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力的这次野蛮袭击，是一次蓄谋已久的行动。最近几个月来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力控制的报纸在它们的反华叫嚣中，一直在大肆攻击新华社和北京电台。
    九日上午十一时，右派反动势力组织的数百名暴徒分乘卡车冲到新华社雅加达分社门前。这些手持铁棍、木棒、匕首、石块和燃烧物品的暴徒下车后，高呼“粉碎中华人民共和国”等反华口号，并大声叫嚷“开门，我们有武器，如果不开门，就全部杀死你们。”他们随即翻越院墙，撞开前院大门，一面割断电话线和电铃线，一面拥到办公室前，砸毁办公室门窗。部分暴徒又翻过办公室左侧铁门，冲入汽车房，把一部汽车推出翻倒，纵火焚烧，把另一部汽车的全部玻璃窗砸烂，并且捣毁了汽车房。暴徒们从前、后、左三方包围了分社的办公处所后，向室内投掷石块，袭击分社的记者和工作人员，砸毁门窗和办公用具，暴徒们甚至向办公室屋顶上投掷燃烧瓶，纵火焚烧办公室。
    在暴徒恣意行凶过程中，分社记者李瑞峰头部被暴徒用石块击破，眼部被打肿；分社工作人员邱国武爬上屋顶救火时，也遭到暴徒用石块袭击，以致从屋顶坠地受伤骨折。分社记者张海涛、谭东白和工作人员一人也受了伤。
    这些暴徒对新华社雅加达分社的袭击前后持续一小时。在暴徒行凶半小时以后，印度尼西亚的军警和雅加达警察局消防队才来到现场。
    暴行发生以后，新华社雅加达分社派代表会见印度尼西亚外交部新闻司长阿拉塔斯，向他提出了强烈的抗议。
    新华社十日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动势力继在九日组织暴徒袭击中国国家通讯社新华社雅加达分社之后，在十日清晨又组织两批暴徒，明目张胆地袭击中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆商务参赞处和中国驻雅加达总领事馆，造成极其严重的事件。
    据从雅加达收到的初步消息，十日上午六时四十五分，数百名手持铁棍、木棒、匕首和石块的暴徒，乘卡车来到中国驻雅加达总领事馆前，暴徒们在用卡车撞开总领事馆的大门以后，用起重车撞毁院墙，有的暴徒从起重车的吊臂上爬上屋顶，闯进内院打开二门后，手持凶器的暴徒约二、三百人即拥进内院，逢人就打，见物就砸，他们破门和破窗进入办公室和卧室，进行彻底的破坏，抢走文件和工作人员的衣物，砸毁内部的家具、电视机、电冰箱等物，破坏和劫走了所有私人的收音机、照象机。暴徒们还劫走了中国的国旗、国徽和总领事馆的铜牌，劫走了汽车一部。领事马登杰、副领事李惠卿及八名工作人员被打伤，其中，三人受重伤。暴徒的袭击破坏持续约半小时左右。当暴徒破坏完毕离开总领事馆内院时，才有几名警察到场。
    十日上午七时，又有数百名暴徒袭击了中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆商务参赞处。暴徒们公然冲破商务参赞处的大门，推倒院墙，冲入内院，打伤了包括商务参赞王斌在内的外交官员和工作人员十五人，其中六人受重伤。暴徒们劫走商务参赞处的铜牌，劫走及烧毁办公室的文件档案，疯狂地捣毁办公室和宿舍。暴徒们趁机大肆劫掠，抢走办公用的打字机、计算机和仓库中的样品，劫走或毁坏工作人员宿舍内的录音机、收音机、照象机和所有衣物，甚至连皮箱也一起抢走。暴徒们还劫走汽车一辆，并且当场放火烧毁汽车两辆，砸毁两辆。暴行历时两个半小时之久。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆已就这两起无视国际关系的基本准则、野蛮地侵犯中国使领馆的特权和中国使领馆人员的人身安全的严重事件，向印度尼西亚外交部提出最强烈抗议。
