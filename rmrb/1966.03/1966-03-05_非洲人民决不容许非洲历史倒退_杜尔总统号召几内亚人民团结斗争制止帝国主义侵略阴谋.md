    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, Conakry dispatch: According to Guinean radio broadcasts, Guinean President Sékou Touré condemned the British organization and instigation of the coup in Ghana at a mass rally organized by the Democratic Party of Guinea on February 27th.
    February 27th was designated by the Democratic Party of Guinea as a national day to defend African freedom and achieve African unity following the coup in Ghana. On this day, powerful demonstrations were held throughout Guinea, expressing the Guinean people's fighting will against imperialism.
    In his speech, President Touré warned, "If the British think they have succeeded, they are greatly mistaken. They have not learned anything from history. We solemnly declare here, even more powerfully than London Radio: those criminals who caused this coup in Ghana will pay the price."
    He condemned imperialism for constantly plotting coups in Africa and attempting to re-colonize young independent countries through coups and other means in order to oppress and exploit these countries as in the past.
    President Touré pointed out that to achieve victory, there is no other path to take, only one: the path of the people who struggle every day, and African freedom will be the result of the struggle of the peoples of all African countries. He said that if imperialism thinks its moment has arrived, then the progressives in Africa say to imperialism: Thank you! Because the imperialist offensive will accelerate the course of African history.
    He said that imperialism is preparing to fight a third world war. Those who prepare for war are digging their own graves, and the people will triumph over all evil forces and forces of war.
    He announced that Guinea is ready to deal with any imperialist aggression. He said, "We are strengthening our independence and sovereignty. We will stop the evil hand of imperialism that strangles Africa in Guinea."
    He said that what will win the struggle is not bombs, but the people. The decisive means are people's thoughts and political consciousness. If the Guinean people remain united and sincerely anti-imperialist in the face of the main contradiction between Africa and imperialism, then no foreign power can subdue the Guinean people. He said, "We must arm the people." Every village will be organized and undergo military training.
    President Touré said, we swear to die for the cause of freedom. We swear that we will never be servants and accomplices of the imperialist forces that oppose Africa.
    At the end of the meeting, he and the masses shouted angrily: Down with imperialism! Down with colonialism!
    The National Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea held a special meeting on February 24th, chaired by the party's Secretary-General Sékou Touré, to discuss the situation in Ghana. A communiqué issued after the meeting pointed out that the military coup launched in Ghana was a sinister new blow by imperialism against the Ghanaian people and Africa. The communiqué said that this event fully demonstrates that the imperialist forces, in collusion with national scum who sell themselves to them, are systematically implementing a broad plan to re-conquer African countries.
    The communiqué said that the National Political Bureau, recognizing the danger posed to the future of Africa by the offensive launched by imperialism against progressive Africa for the benefit of neo-colonialists, resolutely declared that the Guinean people are determined to continue fighting alongside the fraternal Ghanaian people until the counter-revolution is eliminated. The Guinean people are ready to receive President Nkrumah to carry out this noble fight and achieve the victory of the people.
    After the meeting, President Sékou Touré also sent a telegram to President Nkrumah saying, "We are extremely indignant to learn of the military coup against your government and party. It is very obvious that this is a crime committed by the treacherous enemies of freedom, imperialism, and its despicable accomplices and traitors of African countries."
    The Executive Bureau of the National Confederation of Workers of Guinea has passed a resolution expressing its support for the actions taken by the Democratic Party of Guinea and President Touré to support the Ghanaian people, government, and its head, President Nkrumah.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, Bamako dispatch: The National Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union-African Democratic Rally of Mali issued a statement after a meeting on the afternoon of February 25th, strongly condemning the imperialist forces and all those who directly or indirectly participated in the military coup against the Ghanaian people, and strongly condemning this counter-revolutionary event that seriously damaged the dignity and honor of Africa.
    The statement, broadcast by Malian Radio on the evening of February 25th, said that the National Political Bureau is convinced that this serious event "is part of a general offensive launched by imperialism to undermine the independence and sovereignty of our young countries."
    The statement said that considering the fraternal and fighting relationship linking the Ghanaian and Malian peoples, the National Political Bureau expressed its fighting solidarity with President Nkrumah and the revolutionary Ghanaian people. The National Political Bureau guarantees to give President Nkrumah firm support and complete hospitality.
    The National Political Bureau called on all party members and the people to designate February 26th and 27th, 1966, as days of active solidarity with the fraternal Ghanaian people.
    The statement finally called on all party members and the people to unite and mobilize to defend the independence and dignity of Mali and Africa.
    The National Confederation of Workers of Mali issued a statement on February 26th regarding the coup in Ghana, saying that this event falls within the scope of imperialism's overall strategy against the freedom and independence of all peoples, against the unity of all progressive forces, and against African unity. This event demonstrates imperialism's sinister attempt to achieve its goals by taking all means such as political or economic pressure and acts of aggression.
    The statement pointed out that imperialist violence is by no means a symbol of strength, but a manifestation of imperialism's weakness.
    The statement called on the working people of Africa to deal a fatal blow to imperialism's strategy and eliminate imperialism.
    The National Committee of the Youth Organization of the Sudanese Union-African Democratic Rally of Mali held an enlarged special meeting on February 27th to discuss the Ghana event. The National Committee issued a statement expressing great indignation at the coup in Ghana and called on all the youth of Mali to mobilize to defend the achievements of the Malian revolution and safeguard the dignity of Africa.
    The Women's Organization of the Sudanese Union-African Democratic Rally of Mali discussed the Ghana event on February 27th and condemned this subversive activity. This women's organization supports the Sudanese Union's unremitting adherence to the struggle against all forms of imperialism until the complete victory of Africa's independence and dignity.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, Dar es Salaam dispatch: Tanzanian President Nyerere strongly condemned the military coup that took place in Ghana on February 28th and expressed his support for Nkrumah.
    President Nyerere made these remarks at a press conference held in Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian Second Vice President Kawawa also attended the press conference.
    President Nyerere said that the African revolution is in excellent shape. Africa has been under colonial rule, Africa has been exploited and oppressed, and neo-colonialism exists in Africa. Africa should eliminate colonialism, exploitation, and oppression.
    Referring to the recent coup in Ghana, President Nyerere said that Nkrumah advocated the liberation of Africa. "Nkrumah is determined to achieve true independence. He opposes neo-colonialism, he opposes colonialism going out of one door - the political door - and coming back in through another door - the economic door - and controlling that country. It is undeniable that some African countries are only nominally free, but not truly free." President Nyerere said that many changes of government in African countries have made the enemies of Africa elated, especially the recent events in Ghana. He said that these are "revolutions" that stop revolutions.
    Nyerere said, "Africa should not be discouraged by this. The African revolution is in excellent shape. We must continue the African revolution. We must carry out this revolution in Mozambique, Angola, and all occupied Africa until Africa is free. Africa does not need to be alarmed by a wrong revolutionary wave. Our attention must continue to be directed at those forces that insult, exploit, and oppress Africa. We must not stop."
    President Nyerere welcomed Nkrumah to Tanzania at any time.

    非洲人民决不容许非洲历史倒退
    杜尔总统号召几内亚人民团结斗争制止帝国主义侵略阴谋
    马里执政党支持恩克鲁玛总统并号召人民动员起来保卫非洲独立
    尼雷尔总统严正谴责加纳军事政变并指出非洲革命必须继续进行
    新华社四日讯　科纳克里消息：据几内亚电台广播，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔二月二十七日在几内亚民主党组织的一次群众大会上谴责英国组织和发动了加纳政变。
    二月二十七日是几内亚民主党在加纳政变后规定的保卫非洲自由和实现非洲统一全国日。在这一天，几内亚全国各地举行了强大的示威，表示几内亚人民反对帝国主义的战斗意志。
    杜尔总统在讲话中警告说，“如果英国人以为他们获得了成功，那他们就大错而特错了。他们没有从历史得到任何教训。我们在这里庄严地而且比伦敦电台更有力地宣布：凡是引起加纳这次政变的罪犯将为此付出代价。”
    他谴责帝国主义在非洲不断策动政变，并且企图通过政变和其他方法使年轻的独立国家重新殖民地化，以便象过去一样地压迫和剥削这些国家。
    杜尔总统指出，为了取得胜利，没有其他道路可走，只有一条道路，那就是天天进行斗争的人民的道路，而非洲的自由将是非洲各国人民斗争的结果。他说，如果帝国主义认为它的时机已经到来的话，那么非洲的进步人士对帝国主义说：谢谢！因为帝国主义的进攻将加速非洲历史的进程。
    他说，帝国主义正在准备打第三次世界大战。那些准备战争的人正在挖掘他们自己的坟墓，人民将战胜一切罪恶势力和战争力量。
    他宣布，几内亚已准备好对付任何帝国主义侵略。他说，“我们在加强我们的独立和主权。我们将在几内亚制止扼杀非洲的帝国主义罪恶之手。”
    他说，赢得斗争胜利的，将不是炸弹，而是人民。决定性的手段是人的思想和政治觉悟。如果几内亚人民在非洲和帝国主义之间的主要矛盾面前，保持团结和真诚反帝，那么任何外国政权都不能使几内亚人民屈服。他说，“我们必须把人民武装起来。”每个村庄都将组织起来和进行军事训练。
    杜尔总统说，我们宣誓为自由的事业而死。我们宣誓，我们将永远不作反对非洲的帝国主义力量的奴仆和共谋者。
    他在大会结束时和群众一起愤怒地高呼：打倒帝国主义！打倒殖民主义！
    几内亚民主党全国政治局二月二十四日在党的总书记塞古·杜尔的主持下举行特别会议，讨论加纳局势。会后发表的一项公报指出，在加纳发动的军事政变是帝国主义对加纳人民和非洲进行的一次阴险的新的打击。公报说，这次事件充分地证明了帝国主义势力，在卖身投靠他们的民族败类共谋下，正在有步骤地推行一个重新征服非洲各国的广泛计划。
    公报说，全国政治局认识到帝国主义为了新殖民主义者的利益对进步非洲发动的攻势给非洲前途带来的危险，断然宣布几内亚人民决心同兄弟的加纳人民一道继续战斗，不消灭反革命决不罢休。几内亚人民准备接待恩克鲁玛总统，以进行这个崇高的战斗，实现人民的胜利。
    塞古·杜尔总统在会后还打电报给恩克鲁玛总统说，“我们极其愤慨地得悉反对您的政府和党的军事政变的消息，非常明显，这是自由的背信弃义的敌人帝国主义及其卑鄙的同谋者和非洲国家的叛徒所犯下的罪行。”
    几内亚全国工人联合会执行局已经作出决议，表示赞同几内亚民主党和杜尔总统为支持加纳人民、政府及其首脑恩克鲁玛总统而采取的行动。
    新华社四日讯　巴马科消息：马里苏丹联盟党全国政治局二月二十五日下午举行会议后发表一项声明，强烈谴责帝国主义势力以及所有直接或间接参加反对加纳人民的军事政变的人，强烈谴责这次严重地损害非洲尊严和荣誉的反革命事件。
    马里电台二月二十五日晚广播的这项声明说，全国政治局确信，这种严重事件“是帝国主义企图损害我们年轻国家的独立和主权而发动的总攻势的一部分”。
    声明说，考虑到把加纳人民和马里人民联系在一起的兄弟的和战斗的关系，全国政治局对恩克鲁玛总统和革命的加纳人民表示战斗的声援。全国政治局保证给予恩克鲁玛总统坚决的支持和周全的接待。
    全国政治局号召全体党员和人民，把一九六六年二月二十六日和二十七日作为积极声援加纳兄弟人民日。
    声明最后要求全体党员和人民一致动员起来，保卫马里以及非洲的独立和尊严。
    马里全国工人联合会二月二十六日就加纳政变发表声明说，这一事件是属于帝国主义反对各国人民的自由和独立、反对一切进步力量的团结和非洲统一的总战略的范围之内的。这一事件表明了帝国主义要采取政治或经济压力和侵略活动等一切手段来达到自己目的的凶恶企图。
    声明指出，帝国主义的暴力决不是力量的象征，而是帝国主义虚弱的表现。
    声明号召非洲劳动人民对帝国主义的战略给予致命的打击，消灭帝国主义。
    马里苏丹联盟党青年组织全国委员会二月二十七日举行扩大特别会议，讨论加纳事件。全国委员会发表声明，对加纳政变表示极大的愤慨，并号召马里全体青年动员起来保卫马里革命的成果和维护非洲的尊严。
    马里苏丹联盟党妇女组织二月二十七日讨论了加纳事件以后，谴责这一颠覆活动。这个妇女组织支持苏丹联盟党不懈地坚持反对一切形式的帝国主义的斗争，直到非洲的独立和尊严取得完全胜利为止。
    新华社四日讯　达累斯萨拉姆消息：坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔二月二十八日强烈谴责在加纳发生的军事政变，并且表示支持恩克鲁玛。
    尼雷尔总统是在达累斯萨拉姆举行的记者招待会上讲这些话的。坦桑尼亚第二副总统卡瓦瓦也出席了记者招待会。
    尼雷尔总统说，非洲革命形势大好。非洲受过殖民统治，非洲受过剥削和压迫，在非洲存在着新殖民主义。非洲应该消灭殖民主义、剥削和压迫。
    尼雷尔总统在谈到最近的加纳政变时说，恩克鲁玛主张的是非洲的解放。“恩克鲁玛决心实现真正的独立。他反对新殖民主义，他反对殖民主义从一个大门——政治大门——走出去，又从另一个大门——经济大门——回来并控制那个国家。不可否认，有一些非洲国家只是名义上自由的，而不是真正的自由。”尼雷尔总统说，很多非洲国家政府的更迭都使非洲的敌人兴高采烈，特别是最近加纳的事态。他说，这些是阻止革命的“革命”。
    尼雷尔说，“非洲不应当因此沮丧。非洲的革命形势大好。我们必须继续进行非洲的革命。我们必须在莫三鼻给、安哥拉和所有被占领的非洲进行这种革命，直到非洲获得自由。非洲不必由于出现了一股不对头的革命浪潮而惊慌失措。我们的注意力必须继续针对那些侮辱、剥削和压迫非洲的势力。我们不应当停下来。”
    尼雷尔总统表示欢迎恩克鲁玛在任何时候到坦桑尼亚去。
