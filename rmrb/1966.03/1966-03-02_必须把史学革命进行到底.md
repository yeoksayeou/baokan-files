Foreword

    This article was written in August 1964. For this publication, only a few minor textual revisions were made.

    The erroneous tendencies in historical research discussed in the article were examined at the time only as a social phenomenon, without naming names for criticism. However, the erroneous tendencies discussed here are based on facts.

    Please criticize the views on the historical revolution in the article for their appropriateness.

    I. The Entire History Must Be Re-Researched

    For the liberation of the proletariat, Marx and Engels explored the theories of philosophy, political economy, and socialism, established the revolutionary theoretical system of Marxism, ideologically armed the proletariat, and thus initiated a climax of the communist movement worldwide. They created historical materialism, the scientific view of history, and wrote a series of exemplary historical works, thereby making history a true science. Engels pointed out that the materialist conception of history should be used as a guide to re-research the entirety of history.① We must understand that the era in which Marx and Engels lived was still an era when the bourgeoisie ruled the world, and the primary task of the proletariat was to launch a political struggle to seize power. Both Marx and Engels actively led the revolutionary movement at that time, devoting tremendous energy to the revolutionary practice and theoretical struggle urgently needed at that time. They did not have time to rewrite the entire history.

    Now we have the conditions to re-research and rewrite the entirety of history under the guidance of the Marxist scientific view of history, to systematically expose the crimes of the exploiting classes in distorting and fabricating history, and to return the history created by the broad masses of working people to the broad masses of working people in its true colors.

    However, history has long been in the hands of the exploiting classes. For their class interests and with their class prejudices, historians employed by the exploiting classes in various countries for generations have compiled a large number of historical books that distort history. These historical books have been popular in various countries for a long time, forming a traditional force, as if this were the true history. The historical data accumulated over a long period of time, after being processed, sorted, selected, eliminated, abridged, and interpreted by historians of the exploiting classes, will inevitably be injected with their class prejudices, and every word and line is filled with strong class character.

    Re-researching and rewriting the entirety of history under the guidance of the Marxist materialist conception of history is a very arduous task. In order to complete this combat mission, proletarian historians must completely liberate history from the hands of the exploiting classes. This is a revolution in the historical discipline, a world-shaking historical revolutionary movement. Without such a revolution, it would be impossible to remove the toxins that the exploiting classes have instilled in history for a long time, to truly establish Marxist historical science, and to write a true history of the working people.

    For the interests of monopoly capital groups, imperialists use history to promote their imperialist and colonialist theories, compile various reactionary historical books to confuse and paralyze the people of various countries, and relax the people's fighting spirit. Reactionary nationalists inherit the imperialist historical theories, distort their own country's history, and distort the history of relations between their own country and neighboring countries. Modern revisionists abandon the fundamental revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism and inherit the theories of old revisionists. In fact, they have become the shock troops of neo-colonialism. Now, modern revisionists have infiltrated their theories into the study of party history, the history of the workers' movement, and the history of international relations, and are tampering with the entire history. The historical theories of modern revisionists are not new things, but things picked up from the historical theories of the exploiting classes. However, they use the banner of Marxism to deceive and bluff. This makes it easier to confuse people and play a role that bourgeois reactionary historical theories cannot play. Without recognizing its essence and clearing its toxins, it will inevitably become a corrosive agent for the bourgeoisie to infiltrate Marxist history.

    In the field of history, we must resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against the historical theories of imperialism, reactionary nationalism, and modern revisionism. Only in this way can we understand the true face of history and clarify the inevitable laws of historical development. This is a solemn and glorious task placed before contemporary Marxist historians.

    Marxist historians should use the scientific view of history to conduct serious criticism of the historical heritage of various countries and write scientific history. We believe that in the Mao Zedong era, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, our historians will surely be able to successfully complete this historical mission.

    II. Class Struggle on the Historical Front

    Our criticism of the historical heritage of the exploiting classes is a struggle for the proletariat to seize the theoretical position of history from the exploiting classes, and it is a component of the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, that is, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism.

    In modern times, with the invasion of imperialism, all kinds of reactionary bourgeois historical thoughts from the West came along with it, merged with feudal historical thoughts, and formed the reactionary history of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China. It was a tool for the reactionary ruling class's political struggle.

    During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, Marxist revolutionaries, combined with the needs of the revolutionary struggle at that time, criticized feudal and bourgeois history, exposed its hypocritical and unscientific essence, revealed the regularity of social historical development, pointed out the inevitable trend of historical development, and guided the broad masses of young people to the revolution. Some progressive historians have also done some work in this regard. This is undoubtedly an organic component of the national democratic revolutionary movement and an important stage in the development of Marxist history in our country.

    In 1949, our revolution was victorious, the proletariat seized power, and Marxism-Leninism became the guiding ideology of the country. From then on, Marxist historical science in our country had the conditions for comprehensive development.

    Over the past ten years, we have made some achievements in criticizing the historical heritage. However, some historians often emphasize inheritance and ignore criticism; some people even vigorously promote feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts and attack Marxist history.

    Why does this happen?

    Before liberation, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Marxist history was in an illegal position, while feudal and bourgeois history was in a legal position. Reactionary historians, in line with the political needs of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime, directly attacked Marxism and opposed Marxist historical science. There were also some historians who, under reactionary political pressure, dared not touch politics and conducted academic research in the atmosphere of "academic research for academic research." They seemed to be "above class," but in reality, how could they escape the ideological framework of the idealist conception of history? These people intentionally or unintentionally spread feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts in society, in schools, and in academic circles for a long time.

    After liberation, due to the tremendous social and political changes, the historical circles were also undergoing changes. Most historians are willing to study Marxism, and many have indeed made considerable progress. There are also some people who, on the surface, put away their anti-Marxist stuff, but in their hearts, they remain the same. For example, people who used to talk about Li Zicheng as a bandit have to say today that Li Zicheng was the leader of the peasant uprising; however, they continue to slander the leader of the peasant uprising in a subtle and roundabout way in their articles. People who used to vigorously promote the Cheng-Zhu school of thought have to say today that it is feudal neo-Confucianism; however, they play with the so-called "abstract inheritance method" and continue to promote the Cheng-Zhu school of thought. It seems that they have really become Marxist, but in fact, if their academic thoughts are carefully analyzed, the so-called "transformation" is just adding some Marxist words.

    During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, the left wing of bourgeois historians became increasingly dissatisfied with the reactionary rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and became allies of the revolution in politics. This political positive factor to a certain extent influenced their academic views, making their academic thoughts have a certain progressiveness. Although their world outlook was still bourgeois, some of the historical research work they did at that time played a certain role. The victory of the New Democratic Revolution, these friends certainly have a share, of course, also in the ranks of the victors.

    However, we must recognize that the victory of the New Democratic Revolution is by no means the victory of this or that bourgeois theory, but the victory of Marxism-Leninism, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The victory of the New Democratic Revolution opened a new era of socialist revolution. With the deepening of the socialist revolution, bourgeois historical thought has become a stumbling block hindering the progress of history.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said:

    "In our country, although socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed, the large-scale, rapid, and stormy mass class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie is just being transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce."②

    In highly partisan historical science, the struggle between the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the proletarian materialist conception of history and the bourgeois idealist conception of history, is also long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce.

    The historical science of the exploiting classes has a long history. The historical science of the exploiting classes and the idealist conception of history as its soul can never disappear by themselves due to the victory of the revolution. Historians who adhere to the bourgeois stand will inevitably take various forms to attack Marxist history. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they cannot openly oppose Marxism, and often distort Marxism in the guise of Marxism, and oppose Marxism in the form of supporting Marxism.

    Looking back at the history of the development of history over the past ten years, this struggle has often taken different forms at different stages. In the early days of liberation, forced by the power of the revolutionary victory, the right wing of bourgeois historians naturally had to put away their extremely idealist and reactionary set and wait for changes to occur. When the bourgeois rightists attacked the Party, a few right wings of bourgeois historians once became rampant. After the struggle to counter the bourgeois rightists, after the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, and after the criticism of bourgeois historical thought, especially the criticism of "valuing the ancient and despising the present," the historical circles had a preliminary exposure of the face of reactionary historical thought, and had a preliminary understanding of the class struggle reflected in this discipline, and the market for reactionary historical thought was undoubtedly reduced.

    After this, our historical work has had considerable development. In particular, revolutionary young historians, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, dare to declare war on the feudal and bourgeois historical traditions, dare to praise the laboring people in history, dare to despise the emperors, generals, and ministers of the past, and dare to break the feudal dynasty system of imperial genealogy. This spirit of trying to re-research and rewrite the entire history with Marxism-Leninism, this spirit of daring to revolution and being brave in fighting is very valuable.

    Under such circumstances, it is even more inconvenient for the right wing of bourgeois historians to openly oppose the Party's academic policies and to openly use extremely idealist theories to compete with Marxism. They often distort to the right and pull to the right in a gesture of supporting the Party's academic policies, and even adopt two-faced methods of outwardly complying and inwardly resisting. When the leadership corrects certain shortcomings in academic research, they take the opportunity to correct "leftism" and try to exaggerate certain shortcomings in an attempt to completely negate the Party's class policy and negate the criticism of bourgeois history by Marxism.

    At this stage, the right wing of bourgeois historians mostly did not appear in the form of extreme idealist historical views, but participated in academic debates as Marxist historical theorists. On the surface, they were full of classic works, but in essence, they tried to castrate the revolutionary core of Marxist theory. Their words were very eloquent, but their hearts were extremely ugly!

    During the period from 1959 to 1962, due to the sabotage of modern revisionists and serious natural disasters, we encountered temporary economic difficulties. During this period, ghosts and monsters came out in large numbers, and the class struggle in the field of history also became acute. In the past few years, in the treatment of the Party's academic policies, in the debate on many historical issues, and in the methods of learning, there has been a struggle between the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

    In historical research, as in the entire academic field, we adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in order to gradually clarify right and wrong through repeated debates, so as to develop Marxist historical science and gradually eliminate feudal and bourgeois thoughts in history. This is a firm, positive, and proletarian class policy. Bourgeois historians try to turn "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" into a policy of bourgeois liberalization. No matter what they "bloom," they cannot be criticized. Do you criticize? That is "obstructing" their "blooming," that is, not allowing them to "contend," that is, violating "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Is there no class struggle in the ideological field here?

    We have always cherished the historical heritage of the motherland, and we say that we must criticize it and absorb its essence. Do you want to criticize? He said that you are "nihilism" and obliterate the heritage; do you want to inherit it? He considers himself the heritage, "inheriting me is inheriting the heritage." These historians oppose criticism and try to steal the consciousness of the exploiting classes into Marxist history. The depths of these historians' souls are still filled with feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts. Are people who piously salute the idol of Confucius not a typical example?

    Different schools of thought in science can freely argue, and no one shall suppress new forces or suppress reasonable opinions. Of course, in the historical circles, any new insights and new viewpoints that attempt to use Marxism-Leninism to explore historical issues will inevitably touch certain old insights and old viewpoints. New insights and new viewpoints are often produced in the struggle to criticize and negate old insights and old viewpoints. In this free debate of theories, certain people will inevitably be involved, which is a normal phenomenon. However, certain bourgeois historians, based on the traditional habits of the old academic circles, are suspicious and maliciously speculate that so-and-so is attacking so-and-so, and so-and-so is attacking so-and-so, using the sectarian emotions of mutual intrigue in the old society to distort certain principled disputes in academia, and spread rumors in an attempt to transform serious scientific right and wrong issues into vulgar personnel disputes. They use certain historians' disagreements in the understanding of policies or historical theoretical viewpoints, do their best to sow discord, manipulate, jump up and down, support so-and-so, oppose so-and-so, and forcibly stuff the despicable methods of the old academic circles into today's historical circles. Are they not using this method to attack the leftists and try to disintegrate our revolutionary historical team?

    Some bourgeois historians try to monopolize the historical forum. They are ignorant and drowsy, self-proclaimed authorities, reigning over the historical circles. Under the domination of sectarian emotions, they form the academic style of "loving those they love and wanting them to live, hating those they hate and wanting them to die," and "those who obey me will prosper, and those who oppose me will perish." Their spearheads are especially directed at young historians, mocking, ridiculing, and wantonly scolding them, saying that the young people are "naive," "ignorant," and "empty," and are "blasters" who destroy their "great achievements." They try to use this method to bring down revolutionary young historians. On the other hand, for the few young people who follow them step by step, they think that they are geniuses and the hope for the future, boasting and praising them endlessly, and cultivating their successors.

    We advocate "using theory to lead history." That is to say, we must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to study history, give scientific analysis to a large number of historical facts, and oppose the bourgeois historical views of "history for the sake of history" and "historical data is history." This policy was originally very clear. However, some bourgeois historians distorted "using theory to lead history" into "using theory to replace history" and attacked it vigorously. They oppose theory to historical facts, and in the name of "respecting historical facts," they practice "historical data is history." They unilaterally exaggerate the role of "textual research" in an attempt to resist Marxist theory with textual research. Isn't their purpose to abolish the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on historical science?

    The unity of high revolutionariness and high scientificity is an inherent characteristic of Marxism. However, certain bourgeois historians have separated revolutionariness from scientificity, considering themselves to be "scientific" and outside of "revolutionariness." They say that now "there is only revolutionariness, but no scientificity," "either you want scientificity, or you want revolutionariness." May I ask, what scientific history is there without the revolutionary theory of Marxism? Isn't this resisting Marxism?

    We say that the class viewpoint is the core of the materialist conception of history, and the study of social history must be carried out with class analysis, and concrete analysis of class contradictions and class struggle. Certain historians believe that "class analysis is not a panacea" and "class analysis is not needed to study primitive society," attempting to negate class analysis as the basic method for studying social history. May I ask, can the history of class society be studied from a so-called supra-class point of view? Generations of historical books have been slandering the laboring people. Is this not the class viewpoint of the exploiting classes? May I ask, how can we understand the real process of primitive society from no class to the occurrence of class if we do not understand Marxist theory and do not use Marxist class analysis?

    A historian once satirized a draft of Chinese history in this way: "Praising peasants when you see them, and beating landlords when you see them," calling this two major crimes. Such words would actually come from the mouth of a self-proclaimed Marxist historian! We want to ask: Do you advocate "beating peasants when you see them, and praising landlords when you see them"?

    These self-proclaimed Marxist historians stood up to fight for the protection of emperors, generals, and ministers, to fight for the correction of "bad academic styles," and to fight against "ahistoricism." As a result, a series of symposiums and reports appeared, and a series of articles by so-called historical theorists were published. They tried their best to beautify emperors, generals, and ministers. They believed that emperors, generals, and ministers can only be praised, not criticized. Whoever wants to criticize is "nihilism" and "ahistoricism." The peasants in history have become the objects of their slander. First, they say that the peasants are backward, only want to get rich, and only want to become emperors; second, they say that the peasant uprisings have no own ideas, do not oppose the landlord class, and do not oppose the feudal system; third, they say that the peasants are rude, kill too many people, and often cause plagues and social divisions. In short, emperors, generals, and ministers have become the "bright side" of history, while peasants have become the "dark side" of history. This is their "historicism."

    Such things are not enough. Isn't this entire repeated phenomenon in the historical circles a living fact?

    Can revolutionary historical workers allow these reactionary bourgeois historical thoughts to flood everywhere? No, we cannot! In this way, a series of principled and sharp debates have unfolded in the historical circles. On the issue of class viewpoint and historicism, on the issue of peasant war, on the issue of whether feudal morality can be inherited and the evaluation of historical figures, revolutionary historical workers have launched a counterattack against anti-Marxist viewpoints. This is precisely the class struggle in the ideological field.

    The times are changing, the situation of struggle is changing, but the theories and thoughts of some past left-wing historians have stagnated and become increasingly rigid, and their potential old thoughts and old styles have floated up and developed day by day. They are complacent and think that they are "absolutely correct" in the atmosphere of flattery and praise. In this way, they are subtly and drowsily entering the maze of "peaceful evolution." In this way, they become prisoners of feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts, and become voluntary propagandists and promoters of feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts and styles. They do things that "make relatives sad and enemies happy" and "increase the prestige of the bourgeoisie and destroy the ambition of the proletariat."

    Past left-wing historians fought against reactionary history during the New Democratic Revolution and achieved some results. However, don't write all these achievements on your own account, and don't think that the victory of the revolution proves that your historical theories at that time were all correct and are already 100% Marxist. Rereading the works written in the past and seriously examining your historical theories will make you break out in a cold sweat!

    Past left-wing historians could have fully promoted the excellent traditions of the revolution during the socialist revolution, formed a core force, helped young historians, and vigorously promoted the rapid advancement of history. However, some people are not promoting revolutionary traditions, but are developing their own potentially existing feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts, going against the tide, and moving towards their opposite, and are pulling young historians to the right. Isn't this still worthy of deep vigilance? Such arbitrary actions will inevitably roll into the abyss of revisionism!

    If the bourgeois and feudal historical thoughts are not cleared out of the minds of historical workers, and these thoughts are allowed to continue to haunt them, then there is no question of conducting a Marxist criticism of the historical heritage. If this continues, they will look for ancestors and continue their genealogy from the bourgeois and feudal historical science. Then there will only be uncritical inheritance, where can we talk about re-researching and rewriting the entire history?

    If the world outlook of historical workers is not thoroughly transformed and does not change from the bourgeois side to the proletarian side, no matter how many Marxist sentences they recite verbally, they will not be able to jump out of the quagmire of bourgeois history in ten thousand years.

    III. We Must Re-Study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought

    We believe that to truly become a Marxist historical worker, we must first conduct a thorough self-criticism and self-revolution ideologically. This requires re-studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only by truly mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the weapon of criticism, can we thoroughly criticize the historical heritage and play our due role in the struggle for historical revolution.

    When some historical workers mention learning, they often see it relatively easily, thinking that they have already developed the habit of reading, and they can just sit down and read one book after another. In this way, living Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought become lifeless in their hands. They do not study the spiritual essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, but adopt a school-like attitude, chewing on words and phrases, and looking for grounds for their own opinions from classic works. The principle of linking theory with practice has become the words of classic works plus arbitrarily copied "historical materials," forming their own so-called "system," and they think they have become Marxist historians. Although these people have read some Marxist books, in reality, "they have not read them, have not taken root in their minds, cannot apply them, and their class feelings are still old"③. This attitude towards Marxism is by no means the attitude of the proletariat, but the attitude of bourgeois intellectuals.

    History is a science with a high degree of class nature. If one's own position has not been changed and one's ideological feelings have not been changed from the exploiting class to the proletarian side, if there is no abundant, ardent fighting spirit for class struggle and revolution, even if one reads classic works ten thousand times and extracts ten thousand cards, one cannot become a true Marxist historical worker.

    Comrade Mao Zedong requires literary and art workers to "stand on the position of the proletariat and the masses of the people. For communists, it means standing on the position of the Party, standing on the position of Party spirit and Party policies"④. Can we say that the issue of historical workers' position has been correctly resolved? We cannot say that. Although some people verbally hang Marxist words, the depths of their souls are still the kingdom of bourgeois intellectuals, and even there are still strong feudal scholar-official vestiges. If such ideological feelings are not changed, and their minds are full of emperors, generals, literati, and scholars, but the achievements of the laboring people cannot be put in at all, how can they write a true history of the laboring people? How can they truly learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought?

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Most of the intellectuals we have now came from the old society and came from non-laboring people's families. Even if some people came from the families of workers and peasants, they received bourgeois education before liberation, and their world outlook is basically bourgeois, and they still belong to bourgeois intellectuals. If these people do not remove the past set and change to a proletarian world outlook, they will have different views, different positions, and different feelings from the workers and peasants, and they will be incompatible with the workers and peasants, and the workers and peasants will not tell them what is in their hearts"⑤. If there is no common position and feeling with the laboring people, it is difficult to understand the truth that "history is created by the laboring people." Under the domination of the position and emotions of the exploiting classes, what they dream of will never be how to write the history of the laboring people, but only fame, status, royalties, life, and even combining with three friends and six friends to "defend" their private so-called "theories."

    Comrade Mao Zedong said well that our thoughts and feelings must "undergo a change, undergo a transformation," "from one class to another class," "without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible"⑥.

    Our historical workers must truly change their positions, viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings, and truly change from the bourgeois to the proletarian side. They must throw themselves into the heated class struggle, and they must throw themselves into the actual production struggle.

    Now the socialist education movement is being carried out throughout the country, and historical workers should actively participate. We must go to the grassroots level in an organized way, live and work with the laboring people, learn from them humbly, and test and exercise ourselves in the practice of mass class struggle, so that we can truly understand the greatness of labor and the laboring people, and specifically understand the true meaning of class struggle promoting social development. Only in this way can we understand the specific process of the laboring people creating history. Approaching the workers and peasants in real life, understanding the workers and peasants, and feelings will gradually change. In this way, everyone will "have a common language, not only a common language in terms of patriotism, a common language in terms of the socialist system, but also a common language in terms of the communist world outlook"⑦. Only in this way can we "turn the Marxism we learned from books into our own"⑧.

    Will this affect our own work? The question is how to view the work of history. Since history is an important battlefield in the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and since there is a struggle between the two lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the development of history, then to seize this battlefield and consolidate this battlefield, we must have a real Marxist historical team. This team can only be formed in revolutionary practice and in class struggle. It should be understood that the work of history, fundamentally speaking, is to conduct class struggle in theory. A Marxist historical worker only understands the proletarian class struggle, and only has an abundance of proletarian class fighting spirit in the depths of his mind, can he be considered to have the soul of this business. This will not only not delay the business, but on the contrary, it is precisely the most important link in strengthening the business.

    "We have a task!" Yes, as theoretical work cadres, we should seriously complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state. We look back at the situation in the past ten years. Of course, we have done a lot of work, trained a large number of historical cadres, written some treatises, and also carried out theoretical struggles in history; however, after serious examination, how well have these tasks been completed? To what extent has the historical team been Marxistized? How much Marxism is there in those treatises? Isn't this worthy of our deep thought? If the position, viewpoint, thought, and feeling are not seriously transformed, the task of Marxist history cannot be completed. If you go on in a careless manner, it is worth considering for which class you are completing the task.

    "We want to read." We never oppose, but on the contrary, we advocate serious reading. However, we oppose static and isolated reading methods, and oppose the bookworm-style attitude of "reading for the sake of reading"; if this continues, "reading ten thousand books will only lead to confusion," and the more you read, the stupider you become.

    I think the way to deal with such comrades is to first read the "living book" of the actual class struggle. The current "living book" with extremely rich content is very worth reading carefully. Although it has not yet been written into words and printed into books, it contains the positions, viewpoints, and emotions written by various classes and individuals in social struggles with words and actions, which forms the chapters of mass class struggle. This is a book of Marxist class struggle theory closely combined with actual class struggle, and it is living Marxism. Only by reading this "living book" can the Marxism learned from books truly become our own, and can the verbal Marxism become living Marxism in actual struggle.

    Only when we seriously read through this "living book" can we read well the books that have already been written into words, can we discover the great achievements of the laboring people in creating history from those vast old historical books, and can we discover the great role of the class struggle carried out by the broad masses of laboring people for generations in promoting history.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said that young people "are like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Hope is pinned on you"⑨. Young historical workers bear particularly important responsibilities in the long and arduous historical revolution. Therefore, it is even more necessary to seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and go to the actual class struggle to exercise themselves.

    The current socialist education movement is precisely the class struggle in the development of socialist society, and it is a complex and profound revolutionary movement. This is a new topic in the development of Marxist theory and a new revolutionary task put forward by the new social reality. We must catch up, exercise ourselves in this heated class struggle, transform ourselves, and become strong revolutionary fighters who promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie on the historical front.

    Throwing ourselves into the class struggle is a century-old plan for cultivating red historical workers.

    The first step in re-studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought should begin with social practice and with participating in actual class struggle. Historical workers participating in actual social struggle is also a scientific experiment of historical science. Participating once cannot be used for a lifetime. Participating in actual social struggle for a certain period is also completely necessary in the future.

    In order to transform the historical team and to improve the class consciousness of the historical team, we must re-study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and we must face up to the non-proletarian thoughts in the depths of our personal thoughts, launch struggles, and eliminate them.

    Knowing ourselves, transforming ourselves; knowing the current situation of history, transforming history, and carrying out historical revolution are the purposes of our re-studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

    Criticizing feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts and carrying out historical revolution is a matter of great importance. Historical revolution is a component of socialist revolution, and it is a question of thoroughly eliminating the influence of feudal and bourgeois thoughts among the millions of people. Feudal and bourgeois historical thoughts are a potential force for capitalist restoration, and only by thoroughly carrying out historical revolution can it be eliminated.

    We must carry the historical revolution through to the end!

    必须把史学革命进行到底
    尹达
    前记
    这篇文章是一九六四年八月写的，这次发表，只作了个别的文字修改。
    文章里谈的史学研究中的一些错误倾向，当时只是作为一种社会现象来考察的，没有指名道姓地进行批判。但是，这里所谈的一些错误倾向是有事实根据的。
    文章中对史学革命的一些看法是否妥当，请同志们批评。
    一、必须重新研究
    全部历史
    马克思、恩格斯为了无产阶级的解放，探讨了哲学、政治经济学和社会主义的理论，建立了马克思主义这一革命的理论体系，从思想上武装了无产阶级，从而在世界范围内掀起了共产主义运动的高潮。他们创立了历史唯物主义这一科学的历史观，写下了一系列典范性的历史论著，从而使史学成为一门真正的科学。恩格斯曾指出，应当以唯物史观作为指南，重新研究全部的历史。①我们必须了解，马克思、恩格斯所处的时代还是资产阶级统治着世界的时代，无产阶级的首要任务是展开政治斗争，夺取政权。马克思、恩格斯都积极领导了当时的革命运动，为当时迫切需要的革命实践和理论斗争付出了巨大的精力。他们没有来得及改写全部的历史。
    现在我们已经有条件，在马克思主义的科学历史观指导下，重新研究和改写全部的历史，系统地揭发剥削阶级歪曲、伪造历史的罪恶，把广大劳动人民所创造的历史，按其真实面貌还给广大劳动人民。
    但是，史学长期掌握在剥削阶级手里。世界各国世世代代的剥削阶级御用的史学家，为其阶级利益，偕其阶级偏见，编写了大量的歪曲历史的史书。这些史书在世界各国长期流行着，已经形成为一种传统的力量，似乎这就是真实的历史。长期积累下来的历史资料，经过剥削阶级史学家的加工、整理、选择、淘汰、删节和阐释，就必然注入其阶级偏见，字里行间无不充满强烈的阶级性。
    以马克思主义的唯物史观为指导，重新研究和改写全部历史，这是一个十分艰巨的任务。为了完成这一战斗任务，无产阶级的史学工作者必须把史学从剥削阶级的手中彻底解放出来。这是历史学科的一个革命，是一个翻天覆地的史学革命运动。不经过这样一场革命，就不可能清除剥削阶级长期灌入史学中的毒素，就不可能真正建立起马克思主义的历史科学，就不可能写出真正的劳动人民的历史。
    帝国主义者，为着垄断资本集团的利益，利用史学宣传其帝国主义的、殖民主义的理论，编造各式各样反动的历史书籍，用以迷惑、麻痹各国的人民，松弛人民的斗志。反动的民族主义者继承着帝国主义的史学理论，歪曲本国的历史，歪曲本国和邻国人民之间的关系的历史。现代修正主义者，抛弃了马克思列宁主义的根本的革命原理，继承着老修正主义者的理论，他们实际上已经成为新老殖民主义的别动队。现在，现代修正主义者已经把他们的理论渗入到党史、工人运动史、国际关系史的研究里面，而且正在对全部历史进行篡改。现代修正主义者的史学理论，并不是什么新货色，而是从剥削阶级的史学理论中捡来的东西。但是，他们却打着马克思主义的招牌，招摇撞骗。这就更容易混淆视听，炫惑人心，起资产阶级反动史学理论所不可能起的作用。不识别它的本质，不清除它的毒素，它就必然成为资产阶级渗入马克思主义史学内部的腐蚀剂。
    在史学领域内，我们必须坚决地同帝国主义、反动的民族主义、现代修正主义的史学理论进行不调和的斗争。只有这样，我们才能够认识历史的真实面貌，阐明历史发展的必然规律。这是摆在当代马克思主义史学工作者面前的严肃的光荣的任务。
    马克思主义的史学工作者，应当用科学的历史观，对世界各国的史学遗产，进行严肃的批判，写出科学的历史。我们相信，在毛泽东时代，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下，我们的史学工作者一定能够胜利地完成这个历史使命。
    二、史学战线上的阶级斗争
    我们对于剥削阶级的史学遗产的批判，是无产阶级从剥削阶级手中夺取史学理论阵地的斗争，是兴无灭资斗争即社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的一个组成部分。
    在近代，随着帝国主义的入侵，西方形形色色反动的资产阶级史学思想随之而来，和封建主义史学思想合流，形成半殖民地、半封建旧中国的反动史学。它是反动统治阶级政治斗争的工具。
    在新民主主义革命时期，马克思主义的革命家结合当时革命斗争的需要，对封建的、资产阶级的史学进行了批判，揭露其虚伪的反科学的本质，揭示社会历史发展的规律性，指出历史发展的必然趋势，引导广大青年走向革命。一些进步的史学工作者，在这方面也曾作了若干工作。这无疑是民族民主革命运动的有机构成部分，是我国马克思主义史学发展的一个重要阶段。
    一九四九年，我国革命胜利了，无产阶级掌握了政权，马克思列宁主义成为国家的指导思想。我国马克思主义的历史科学，从此具备了全面发展的条件。
    十几年来，我们对史学遗产的批判已经作出了某些成绩。但是，有些史学工作者往往强调继承，忽视批判；有些人竟大肆宣扬封建的、资产阶级的史学思想，向马克思主义史学进攻。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？
    解放之前，在国民党统治地区，马克思主义史学处于非法的地位，而封建的、资产阶级的史学却处于合法地位。反动的史学家配合帝国主义、国民党反动政权的政治需要，直接攻击马克思主义，反对马克思主义的历史科学。还有一些史学家，在反动的政治压迫下，不敢触及政治，在“为学术而学术”的气氛中进行学术研究，似乎是“超阶级”的，实际上何曾逃出唯心史观的思想窠臼？这些人有意无意地在社会上，在学校里，在学术界，长期散布着封建的、资产阶级的史学思想。
    解放之后，由于社会的、政治的巨大变化，史学界也在起着变化。大部分史学工作者是愿意学习马克思主义的，有不少人确实有了相当的进步。也有一些人，表面上收起了那套反马克思主义的货色，而思想深处，却依然故我。例如，昨天大讲李自成是流寇的人，今天也不得不说李自成是农民起义的领袖；但是，他们在文章中却隐晦曲折地继续诬蔑农民起义的领袖。昨天还在大肆宣扬程朱之道的人，今天也不得不说那是封建理学；但是，却玩弄所谓“抽象继承法”，继续宣扬程朱之道。看来好象是真的马克思主义化了，其实，如果对他们的学术思想认真加以分析，所谓“化”，只不过是加上了马克思主义的某些词句而已。
    在新民主主义革命时期，资产阶级史学家的左翼，对于大地主大资产阶级的反动统治日益不满，在政治上成为革命的同盟军。这种政治上的积极因素，在一定程度上影响着他们的学术观点，使其学术思想具有一定的进步性。虽然他们的世界观还是资产阶级的，但是，他们所作的某些历史研究工作，在当时曾经起了一定的作用。新民主主义革命的胜利，这些朋友当然是有份的，当然也在胜利者的行列之中。
    但是，我们必须认识，新民主主义革命的胜利，决不是这种或那种资产阶级理论的胜利，而是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。新民主主义革命的胜利，开辟了社会主义革命的新时代。随着社会主义革命的深入，资产阶级史学思想已经成为阻碍史学前进的绊脚石。
    毛泽东同志说：
    “在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”②
    在具有高度党性的历史科学中，无产阶级与资产阶级的两条道路的斗争，无产阶级的唯物史观与资产阶级的唯心史观的斗争，也是长期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。
    剥削阶级史学有长期的历史。剥削阶级史学以及作为它的灵魂的唯心史观，决不可能由于革命的胜利而自行消亡。坚持资产阶级立场的史学家，必然采取各种形式，向马克思主义史学进攻。在无产阶级专政的条件下，他们不可能公开反对马克思主义，往往是披着马克思主义的外衣，歪曲马克思主义，以拥护马克思主义的形式，反对马克思主义。
    回顾十几年来史学发展的历史，这种斗争，在不同阶段，采取的形式往往有所不同。解放初期，迫于革命胜利的威力，资产阶级史学家的右翼，自然要收起他们极端唯心的、反动的一套，静以待变。在资产阶级右派向党进攻时，少数资产阶级史学家的右翼曾经跟着猖獗起来。经过反击资产阶级右派的斗争，经过对资产阶级学术的批判，经过对资产阶级史学思想特别是对“厚古薄今”的批判，史学界对反动史学思想的面貌，有了初步的揭发，对反映在这一学科中的阶级斗争，有了初步的认识，反动史学思想的市场无疑是缩小了。
    在这以后，我们的史学工作有了相当的发展。特别是革命的青年史学工作者，在党的领导和鼓舞下，敢于向封建的、资产阶级的史学传统宣战，敢于歌颂历史上的劳动人民，敢于藐视历代的帝王将相，敢于打破帝王家谱式的封建王朝体系。这种力图用马克思列宁主义重新研究和改写全部历史的精神，这种敢于革命、勇于战斗的精神，是十分可贵的。
    在这样的形势下，资产阶级史学家的右翼更不便公开反对党的学术政策，不便公开以极端唯心主义的理论同马克思主义抗衡。他们往往以一种拥护党的学术政策的姿态，极力向右歪曲，向右拉去，甚至采取阳奉阴违的两面手法。在领导上纠正学术研究中的某些缺点时，他们就在纠“左”的幌子下，极力夸大某些缺点，企图全面否定党的阶级政策，否定马克思主义对资产阶级史学的批判。
    这一阶段，资产阶级史学家的右翼，多数不是以极端唯心史观的形式出现，而是以马克思主义史学理论家的身分参与学术争论。表面上满篇经典著作的辞句，实质上却力图阉割马克思主义理论的革命的核心。其言甚辩，而其心极丑！
    在一九五九年到一九六二年这个期间，由于现代修正主义者的破坏，和严重的自然灾害，我们遭到了暂时的经济困难。在这个期间，牛鬼蛇神大批出笼，史学领域中的阶级斗争也尖锐了起来。几年来，在对待党的学术政策上，在许多史学问题的争论中，在治学方法里，都存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两条道路的斗争。
    在史学研究中，同整个学术领域一样，我们采取“百家争鸣”的方针，是为了经过反复争辩，逐步弄清是非，借以发展马克思主义的历史科学，逐步消除史学中封建的、资产阶级的思想。这是一种坚定不移的、积极的、无产阶级的阶级政策。资产阶级史学家却企图把“百家争鸣”变为资产阶级自由化的政策。不论他们“鸣”什么，都不能批评。你批评吗？那就是“妨碍”了他们“鸣”，那就是不准他们“争鸣”，那就是违犯了“百家争鸣”。这里难道不存在意识形态上的阶级斗争吗？
    我们一向珍视祖国的史学遗产，我们说必须经过批判，汲取其中的精华。你要批判吗？他就说你是“虚无主义”，抹煞遗产；你要继承吗？他就自居遗产，“继承我就是继承遗产”。这些史学家，就是反对批判，企图把剥削阶级的意识偷运到马克思主义史学中来。这些史学家的灵魂深处，还是充满着封建的、资产阶级的史学思想。虔诚地向孔夫子偶象行礼的人，难道不就是典型的例证吗？
    科学上不同的学派可以自由争论，任何人都不得压抑新生力量，压抑合理的意见。当然，在史学界任何试图运用马克思列宁主义探索历史问题的新见解、新观点，都必然会触及某些旧见解、旧观点。新见解、新观点，往往是在批判、否定旧见解、旧观点的斗争中产生出来的。在这种理论的自由争论中必然会涉及到某些人，这本来是正常的现象。可是，某些资产阶级史学家却本着旧学术界的传统习惯，疑神疑鬼，恶意揣测，某某人在打击某某人，某某派在进攻某某派，以旧社会勾心斗角的宗派情绪，歪曲学术上某些原则性的是非之争，并且散布流言蜚语，企图把严肃的科学是非问题，转化为庸俗的人事纠纷。他们利用某些史学工作者在政策的理解上或历史理论观点上的某些分歧，极尽其挑拨离间之能事，纵横捭阖，上窜下跳，拥护某某，反对某某，硬把旧学术界的卑劣手法，塞进今天的史学界。难道他们不是用这种手段，打击左派，企图瓦解我们革命的史学队伍吗？
    某些资产阶级史学家，企图垄断史学论坛。他们懵懵然，昏昏然，自封权威，君临于史学界。他们在宗派情绪支配下，形成“爱之欲其生，恶之欲其死”，“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”的学阀作风。他们的矛头特别指向青年史学工作者，冷嘲热讽，肆意谩骂，说青年“幼稚”、“无知”、“空洞”，是破坏他们“伟大建树”的“爆破手”。企图用这样的手法，把革命的青年史学工作者打下去。另一方面，对于少数亦步亦趋跟着他们走的青年，却认为是天才，是希望所在，大肆吹嘘，赞不绝口，培养起他们的接班人来了。
    我们提倡“以论带史”。就是说，我们必须以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导去研究历史，对于大量史实给以科学的分析，反对“为史实而史实”、“史料即史学”的资产阶级史学观点。这一方针本来是十分明确的。但是，一些资产阶级史学家却把“以论带史”歪曲为“以论代史”，并且大加攻击。他们把理论同史实对立起来，以“尊重史实”为名，行其“史料即史学”之实。他们片面夸大“考据”的作用，企图以考据学抵制马克思主义理论。他们这样作的目的，难道不是要取消马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想对历史科学的指导吗？
    高度革命性与高度科学性的统一，是马克思主义固有的特征。而某些资产阶级史学家却把革命性和科学性割裂开来，自居于“科学性”，自外于“革命性”。说什么现在“只有革命性，而无科学性”，“要末，就要科学性；要末，就要革命性”。试问，离开马克思主义的革命学说还有什么科学性的史学呢？难道这不是抗拒马克思主义吗？
    我们说，阶级观点是唯物史观的核心，研究社会的历史必须进行阶级分析，具体分析阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。某些史学家却认为“阶级分析并不是万应膏”，“研究原始社会就不需要阶级分析”，企图否定阶级分析是研究社会历史的基本方法。试问，研究阶级社会的历史能够用所谓超阶级的观点吗？世世代代的史书都在诬蔑劳动人民，这不是剥削阶级的阶级观点吗？试问，不懂得马克思主义理论，不运用马克思主义的阶级分析，怎么能够了解原始社会从没有阶级到阶级发生的真实过程呢？
    一位史学家曾这样讽刺一部中国历史的稿子：“见农民就捧，见地主就打”，把这说成是两大罪状。这样的话竟会出自一位自称马克思主义史学家之口！我们要问：你们是否主张“见农民就打，见地主就捧”呢？
    这些自称马克思主义的史学家，挺身而出，为保卫帝王将相而战，为纠正“不良学风”而战，为反对“非历史主义”而战。于是，一系列的座谈会、报告会就出现了，一系列的所谓史学理论家的文章就出笼了。他们极力美化帝王将相，他们认为对帝王将相只能歌颂，不能批判。谁要批判，就是“虚无主义”，“非历史主义”。历史上的农民，竟成了他们诬蔑的对象。一说农民落后，只想发财致富，只想做皇帝；二说农民起义没有自己的思想，不反对地主阶级，不反对封建制度；三说农民粗暴，杀人太多，往往造成瘟疫，造成社会的分裂局面。总之，帝王将相成了历史的“光明面”，而农民却成了历史的“黑暗面”。这就是他们的“历史主义”。
    诸如此类，不一而足。整个史学界的这一反复现象，难道不是活生生的事实吗？
    革命的史学工作者能够听任这些反动的资产阶级史学思想到处泛滥吗？不，不能！这样，在史学界就展开了一系列原则性的尖锐争论。在阶级观点与历史主义的问题上，在农民战争的问题上，在封建道德能否继承和历史人物的评价等等问题上，革命的史学工作者向反马克思主义的观点展开了反击。这正是意识形态方面的阶级斗争。
    时代在变化着，斗争形势在变化着，过去的某些左翼史学家，他们的理论和思想却停滞不前，日益僵化，潜在的旧思想、旧作风，浮动起来了，日益发展了。他们就在恭维奉承，吹吹捧捧的气氛中，得意忘形，自以为“绝对正确”。这样，他们就潜移默化，昏昏然地进入了“和平演变”的迷宫。这样，他们就成了封建的、资产阶级的史学思想的俘虏，就成了封建的、资产阶级的史学思想、作风的义务宣传员和推销员。他们尽做一些“亲痛，仇快”，“长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气”的事情。
    过去的左翼史学家，在新民主主义革命时期，同反动史学曾经进行过斗争，取得了一些成绩。但是，千万不要把这些成绩全部写在自己的账上，千万不要以为革命的胜利，证明你当时的史学理论全部正确，已经是百分之百的马克思主义了。重读一番过去所写的著作，认真检查一下自己的史学理论，是会使自己出一身冷汗的！
    过去的左翼史学家，在社会主义革命中，本来可以充分发扬革命的优良传统，形成一种核心力量，帮助青年史学工作者，大力推动史学迅速前进。可是，有些人却不是发扬革命传统，而是在发展本身潜存着的封建的、资产阶级的史学思想，倒行逆施，向自己的反面走去，并且，把青年史学工作者向右拉去。这难道还不值得深自警惕吗？这样的一意孤行，那就必然滚进修正主义的深渊！
    在史学工作者的头脑里，如果资产阶级、封建主义史学思想不清除出去，听任这些思想继续作祟，那就谈不上对于史学遗产进行马克思主义的批判。这样下去，就会向资产阶级的、封建主义的史学那里找祖师，续家谱。那就只有无批判地继承，哪里还谈得上重新研究和改写全部历史？
    如果史学工作者的世界观不经过彻底改造，不从资产阶级方面转变到无产阶级方面来，不论口头上背诵多少马克思主义的辞句，一万年也跳不出资产阶级史学的泥潭。
    三、必须重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想
    我们认为，要真正成为一个马克思主义的史学工作者，首先要从思想上进行彻底的自我批判，自我革命。这就必须重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。只有真正掌握了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这一批判的武器，才能对史学遗产进行彻底的批判，才能在史学革命斗争中起到应有的作用。
    有些史学工作者，一提到学习，往往看得比较轻松，自以为已经养成了读书习惯，坐下来一本本读下去就是了。这样，活生生的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想一到他们手里，就毫无生气了。他们不是学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精神实质，而是采取学院式的态度，咬文嚼字，寻章摘句，从经典著作里为自己的定见找根据。把理论联系实际的原则，变成了经典著作的词句加上任意抄取的“史料”，构成自己的一套所谓
  “体系”，就自以为成了马克思主义史学家了。这些人虽然读了一些马克思主义的书，但是，实际上，“并没有读进去，并没有在头脑里生根，不会应用，阶级感情还是旧的”③。这种对待马克思主义的态度，决不是无产阶级的态度，而是资产阶级知识分子的态度。
    史学是具有高度阶级性的科学，自己的立场如果没有转变过来，思想感情还没有从剥削阶级转变到无产阶级方面来，对阶级斗争、对革命没有充沛的火热的斗志，即令读一万遍经典著作，摘录一万张卡片，也不能成为一个真正的马克思主义史学工作者。
    毛泽东同志要求文艺工作者“站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场”④。史学工作者的立场问题，能不能说已经正确地解决了呢？不能这样说。有些人口头上尽管挂着马克思主义的词句，而灵魂深处却还是资产阶级知识分子的王国，甚至还存在着浓厚的封建士大夫遗习。这样的思想感情如果不加改变，满脑子的帝王将相、文人学士，而劳动人民的业绩却一点也装不进去，怎么能写出真正的劳动人民的历史呢？怎么能真正学到马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想呢？
    毛泽东同志说：“我们现在的大多数的知识分子，是从旧社会过来的，是从非劳动人民家庭出身的。有些人即使是出身于工人农民的家庭，但是在解放以前受的是资产阶级教育，世界观基本上是资产阶级的，他们还是属于资产阶级的知识分子。这些人，如果不把过去的一套去掉，换一个无产阶级的世界观，就和工人农民的观点不同，立场不同，感情不同，就会同工人农民格格不入，工人农民也不会把心里的话向他们讲。”⑤如果和劳动人民没有共同的立场和感情，就很难懂得“历史是劳动人民创造的”这一真理。在剥削阶级的立场和情感支配下，所梦寐以求的，绝不会是如何写出劳动人民的历史，而只能是名誉、地位、稿费、生活，甚至结合三朋六友，“保卫”其私人的所谓“学说”。
    毛泽东同志说得好，我们的思想感情必须“来一个变化，来一番改造”，“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”，“没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的”⑥。
    我们的史学工作者要使自己的立场、观点、思想、感情真正起变化，真正从资产阶级转到无产阶级方面来，就必须投入火热的阶级斗争中去，就必须投入实际的生产斗争中去。
    现在全国正在进行社会主义教育运动，史学工作者应当积极参加。我们要有组织地下到基层，和劳动人民共同生活，共同劳动，虚心向他们学习，在群众性的阶级斗争实践中，考验自己，锻炼自己，使自己真正懂得劳动和劳动人民的伟大，具体认识阶级斗争推动社会发展的真谛。只有这样，才能够了解劳动人民创造历史的具体过程。在实际生活中接近了工农群众，了解了工农群众，感情就会逐渐起变化。这样，大家就“有了共同的语言，不仅有爱国主义方面的共同语言、社会主义制度方面的共同语言，而且还可以有共产主义世界观方面的共同语言”⑦。只有这样，才能把我们“从书本上学来的马克思主义变成自己的东西”⑧。
    这样做，是不是会影响本身的业务呢？问题在于怎样看待史学这样一门业务。史学既然是无产阶级同资产阶级在意识形态斗争中的一个重要阵地，史学发展中既然存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的斗争，那么，要夺取这个阵地，巩固这个阵地，就必须有一支真正的马克思主义的史学队伍。这支队伍只有在革命实践中，在阶级斗争中，才能够形成起来。应当了解，史学的业务，从根本上来说，就是在理论上进行阶级斗争。一个马克思主义史学工作者只有懂得了无产阶级的阶级斗争，只有思想深处具有充沛的无产阶级的阶级斗志，才算具有了这门业务的灵魂。这不仅不会耽误业务，相反的，却正是加强业务的最重要的环节。
      “我们有任务！”是的，作为理论工作干部，应当认真完成党和国家所付予的任务。我们回顾一下十几年来的情况，固然作了不少的工作，培养了大批史学干部，写出了一些论著，在史学中也进行了理论斗争；但是，认真检查一下，这些任务究竟完成得怎样？史学队伍究竟马克思主义化到什么程度啦？那些论著中究竟有多少马克思主义？这不值得我们深思吗？如果立场、观点、思想、感情不来一个认真的改造，马克思主义史学的任务就不能完成。马马虎虎下去，自己究竟为哪个阶级完成任务，就很值得考虑了。
      “我们要读书。”我们绝不反对，相反的，却提倡认真读书。但是，我们却反对静止的、孤立的读书方法，反对书呆子式的
  “为读书而读书”的态度；这样下去，“读书万卷，止以导迷”，越读越蠢。
    我看这样的同志，还是首先读一读现实阶级斗争这本“活
  书”才是办法。当前这本内容极其丰富的活生生的阶级斗争的
  书，很值得精读。虽然还没有写成文字，印成本本，但是，这里却包含着各个阶级、各个人，在社会斗争中，用语言、行动所写下的自己的立场、观点和情感，这就形成群众性的阶级斗争的篇章。这是马克思主义阶级斗争理论密切结合现实阶级斗争的书，是活的马克思主义。只有读懂了这本“活书”，从书本上学来的马克思主义才能够真正变成自己的东西，才能把口头上的马克思主义变成实际斗争中的活的马克思主义。
    我们只有认真地读通了这本“活书”，才有可能很好地读那些已经写成文字的书，才有可能从那些浩如烟海的旧史书中，发现劳动人民创造历史的伟大业绩，才有可能发现广大劳动人民世世代代进行的阶级斗争对历史的伟大推动作用。
    毛泽东同志说，青年人“好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上”⑨。青年史学工作者在长期、艰巨的史学革命中，肩负着特别重大的责任。因此，更需要认真地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，到实际的阶级斗争中去锻炼自己。
    当前的社会主义教育运动，正是社会主义社会发展中的阶级斗争，这是一场复杂的、深刻的革命运动。这是马克思主义理论发展中的一个新的课题，是新的社会实际提出的新的革命任务。我们必须迎头赶上，在这场火热的阶级斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己，成为史学战线上兴无灭资的坚强的革命战士。
    投入阶级斗争中去，是培养红色史学工作者的百年大计。
    重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的首要步骤，应当从社会实践开始，从参加实际的阶级斗争开始。史学工作者参加社会实际斗争，也正是历史科学的科学实验。参加一次并不能受用一生。在一定时期参加社会实际斗争，今后也是完全必要的事。
    为了改造史学队伍，为了提高史学队伍的阶级觉悟，必须重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，必须正视个人思想深处的非无产阶级思想，展开斗争，加以清除。
    认识自己，改造自己；认识当前史学的现状，改造史学，进行史学革命，是我们重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的目的。
    批判封建的、资产阶级的史学思想，进行史学革命，是一件关系重大的事情。史学革命是社会主义革命的一个组成部分，是在千百万人民群众中彻底清除封建的、资产阶级的思想影响的问题。封建的、资产阶级的史学思想是资本主义复辟的一种潜在力量，只有彻底进行史学革命，才能把它清除。
    我们必须把史学革命进行到底！
