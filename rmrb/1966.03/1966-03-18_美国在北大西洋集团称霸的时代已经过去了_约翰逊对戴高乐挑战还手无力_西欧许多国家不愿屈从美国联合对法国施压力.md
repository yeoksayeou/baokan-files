    (Xinhua News Agency, March 17th) Following France's fierce attack on the North Atlantic Group's "military integration," the United States has been trying to use the name of the fourteen nations of the North Atlantic Group to issue a "joint declaration" to exert pressure on France, but without concrete results. News indicates that the "declaration," intended to uphold North Atlantic "military integration," is stillborn, further illustrating that the era of American dominance among its Western allies is over. In addition to France constantly challenging its hegemony, some "little partners" are also becoming less amenable to being controlled.

    Since de Gaulle, in his letter to Johnson on the 7th, demanded France's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group's "military integration" system and jurisdiction over American troops and bases stationed in France, the United States has been actively campaigning among its allies to rally forces against France. It held intense secret consultations with its allies and convened a secret fourteen-nation meeting in Paris on the 11th, without France's participation. On the 14th, it held a second fourteen-nation meeting behind France's back. However, no declaration was issued after the meeting. United Press International said: "The work of drafting the declaration has not been completed" because some allies are unwilling to "immediately confront" de Gaulle and unwilling to take "any hasty action."

    According to Agence France-Presse, Nordic countries and some other countries have expressed opposition and reservations about the draft declaration. The Norwegian government stated that it did not wish to sign a joint declaration expressing loyalty to the North Atlantic Group, so as not to be bound after the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty expires in 1969. "Norway believes that some modifications to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are inevitable, even desirable." Furthermore, "it cannot accept the draft's open criticism of de Gaulle's position on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    The news agency said that Denmark also "expressed coolness" towards the draft declaration, and it "hopes to avoid taking any joint action that might僵化 [make rigid] the current situation." Greece and Turkey also expressed reservations. As early as after France took recent actions, Greek Foreign Minister Tsirimokos declared: "Greece is determined to maintain the best relations with France."

    Because the strongest opposition came from Norway, the US representative to the North Atlantic Group, Cleveland, went to Oslo, the capital of Norway, on the 15th to discuss the North Atlantic Group issue with Norwegian Foreign Minister Løvlien. However, according to DPA, Løvlien "refused to comment on the consequences of the organization's current crisis."

    In the internal strife of the North Atlantic Group, the British Labour government once again hurriedly came out to help the United States. It is reported that the draft declaration discussed at the two fourteen-nation meetings was proposed by the United Kingdom. British Foreign Secretary Stewart also took the lead in attacking France at the West European Union Council meeting that ended on the 16th, echoing the United States' insistence on maintaining "military integration." This behavior of the Labour government was immediately seized by Heath, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, who was campaigning domestically. He attacked the Labour government at a press conference, saying: "It is unrealistic to maintain the status quo of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I do not want to see Britain become increasingly dependent on the United States."

    Currently, the competition within the Atlantic Group is proceeding intensely. US President Johnson specially summoned the US Ambassador to France, Bohlen, back to the country, and re-appointed the veteran diplomat of North Atlantic affairs, Acheson, who is over seventy years old, to conduct emergency consultations with Secretary of State Rusk and Under Secretary of State Ball to study countermeasures. Washington is also intensifying pressure on its allies. White House spokesman Moyers revealed on the 16th that consultations with allies are still ongoing. American newspapers predict that fourteen-nation meetings without France's participation will be held later; and US Under Secretary of State Ball will also take advantage of the opportunity to attend the North Atlantic Group Council meeting in Paris at the end of March to "do work" among the allies.

    Many American newspapers, on the one hand, admit that France's actions have brought "serious consequences" to the North Atlantic Group militarily, politically, and materially. At the same time, they also cooperate with the government's diplomatic activities and do their best to threaten France. These newspapers say that after France withdraws from the North Atlantic Group's "military integration" system, the United States will no longer provide France with "nuclear protection," nor will it supply the French Air Force with tactical nuclear warheads and military aircraft parts. Some newspapers even advocate that France compensate the United States for losses caused by the relocation of bases and the dismantling of facilities.

    However, the French government reiterated its determination. Government spokesman Yvon Bourges announced to reporters after a cabinet meeting on the 16th that France will decide in the "fairly near future" what methods to take to withdraw from the Atlantic "military integration" institutions and restore French sovereignty over foreign bases on its territory.

### 美国在北大西洋集团称霸的时代已经过去了  约翰逊对戴高乐挑战还手无力  西欧许多国家不愿屈从美国联合对法国施压力

    美国在北大西洋集团称霸的时代已经过去了
    约翰逊对戴高乐挑战还手无力
    西欧许多国家不愿屈从美国联合对法国施压力
    据新华社十七日讯　在法国向北大西洋集团“军事一体化”猛烈进攻以后，美国一直在设法借用北大西洋集团十四国的名义发表“联合宣言”来对法国施行压力，但是并没有取得具体结果。消息说，这个“宣言”是要坚持北大西洋“军事一体化”，它的难产进一步说明，美国在西方盟国中称王称霸的时代已经过去。除了法国不断地向它的霸权挑战以外，一些“小伙伴们”也不那么好驾驭了。
    自从戴高乐在七日给约翰逊的信中提出法国退出北大西洋集团“军事一体化”体系和管辖驻法美军和基地的要求以来，美国一直在盟国中积极活动，想纠合力量来反对法国。它同它的盟国进行了紧张的秘密磋商，并且在十一日在巴黎召开了没有法国参加的十四国秘密会议，十四日，又背着法国举行了第二次十四国会议。但是会后并没有发表宣言。合众国际社说：“起草宣言的工作还没有完成”，因为有些盟国不愿意同戴高乐“立即摊牌”，不愿意采取“任何仓促的行动”。
    据法新社透露，北欧国家和其他一些国家对宣言草案表示反对和保留。挪威政府表示，它不希望签署一项表示忠于北大西洋集团的联合宣言，以免自己在一九六九年北大西洋联盟条约期满后还受到约束。“挪威认为，对北大西洋公约组织作某些修改是不可避免的，甚至是可取的。”此外，“它还不能接受草案中公开批评戴高乐对北大西洋公约组织的立场”。
    这家通讯社说，丹麦也对宣言草案“表示冷淡”，它“希望避免采取任何可能使目前的情况僵化的联合行动”。希腊和土耳其也表示保留。早在法国采取最近的行动之后，希腊外交大臣齐里莫科斯就声明：“希腊决心同法国保持最好的关系。”
    由于最强烈的反对来自挪威，美国驻北大西洋集团的代表克利夫兰十五日就去挪威首都奥斯陆，同挪威外交大臣吕恩讨论北大西洋集团问题。但是，据德新社报道，吕恩“拒绝就这个组织目前的危机的结果发表意见”。
    在北大西洋集团内部的纷争中，英国工党政府又一次急急忙忙出来替美国帮忙。据报道，在两次十四国会议上讨论的宣言草案，就是英国提出的。英国外交大臣斯图尔特还在十六日结束的西欧联盟理事会会议上带头攻击法国，附和美国要保持“军事一体化”的主张。工党政府的这种行径立即被正在国内竞选的反对党保守党领袖希思抓住，他在一次记者招待会上攻击工党政府说：“要北大西洋公约组织保持现状是不现实的。我不希望看到英国变得越来越依靠美国。”
    目前，大西洋集团内部的角逐正在紧张进行。美国总统约翰逊为此特地召美国驻法大使波伦回国，并且重新起用七十多岁的北大西洋问题老牌外交家艾奇逊，会同国务卿腊斯克、副国务卿鲍尔连日进行紧急磋商，研究对策。华盛顿还加紧对盟国施压力。白宫发言人莫耶斯十六日透露，同盟国的磋商还在继续进行。美国报纸预料，以后还要举行没有法国参加的十四国会议；而美国副国务卿鲍尔也会利用三月底到巴黎出席北大西洋集团理事会会议的时机，在盟国中“做工作”。
    美国不少报刊一方面承认法国的行动在军事上、政治上和物质上给北大西洋集团带来“严重后果”，同时，它们还配合政府的外交活动，对法国极尽要挟之能事。这些报刊说，法国退出北大西洋集团“军事一体化”体系后，美国就不给法国提供“核保护”了，不供给法国空军战术核弹头和军用飞机零件了。有的报纸甚至主张法国为迁移基地和拆除设施给美国赔偿损失。
    但是，法国官方重申了它的决心。政府发言人伊冯·布歇十六日在一次内阁会议后向记者宣布：法国在“相当近的将来”要决定采取什么方式退出大西洋“军事一体化”机构和恢复法国对自己领土上的外国基地的主权。
