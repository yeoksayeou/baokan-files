    Our Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Reaffirming Firm Support for the Just Position of the Vietnamese People
    Angrily Denouncing the U.S. Imperialists' Frenzied Use of Poisonous Chemicals and Gases in South Vietnam
    The U.S. imperialists' attempt to use this inhuman means to intimidate the Vietnamese people and save their failing fate is a complete delusion. The more barbaric and cruel it is, the more it will arouse the Vietnamese people's determination to fight to the death, and the more it will prompt the people of the world to actively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, thereby accelerating its complete defeat.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on March 24th, denouncing the U.S. imperialists' monstrous crimes of increasingly frantically using various chemical poisons and gases to massacre the people of South Vietnam in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and reaffirmed the Chinese government and the Chinese people's firm support for the just position of the Vietnamese people. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                        March 24, 1966
    In the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is increasingly frantically using various chemical poisons and gases to inhumanely massacre the people of South Vietnam. On March 13th and 22nd, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respectively issued statements, listing a large number of facts to strongly condemn this criminal act of U.S. imperialism to the world, and calling on peace-loving countries and people around the world to stop the aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly support the just position of the Vietnamese people, and denounce with utmost anger the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people.
    For several years, U.S. imperialism has been using chemical poisons and gases as a means of warfare in its aggression against South Vietnam. With the increasing failure of U.S. imperialism on the South Vietnam battlefield and its increasingly tightened pace of expanding the war, its means of killing the Vietnamese people have become even more brutal. Especially recently, in the large-scale "mopping-up" operations launched by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam, the scope of using chemical poisons and gases has become wider and wider, and the frequency has become more and more frequent. Not only that, the Johnson government has also publicly announced that the use of poisonous gas should be regarded as a "basic standard weapon" for the US military in "mopping up", clamoring that it will continue to use it in large quantities in the future. This fully shows that the barbarity of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam has reached the point of madness!
    The evil deeds done by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam have once again exposed the mask of the Johnson government. After the Honolulu Conference, the Johnson government still tried its best to show its "sincerity" in a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue, and even pretended to be a philanthropist, saying that it would carry out "social reforms" and "launch an offensive against hunger and disease" in South Vietnam. However, at this time, U.S. imperialism intensified the war of aggression against South Vietnam to an even more barbaric degree, and spread a variety of high-concentration war poisons and gases to South Vietnam, causing a large number of peaceful residents to be massacred, countless livestock to be poisoned, and hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops to be destroyed. All this shows that all the hypocritical words and peace talks of the Johnson government are nothing more than an accompaniment to its mad slaughter and barbaric war. People know clearly from countless bloody facts that one must not have any illusions about U.S. imperialism, a bloodthirsty robber, but must resolutely fight it to the end.
    All declining reactionary forces in history always resort to the most brutal and shameless means to struggle when they are about to die. The fact that U.S. imperialism disregards the condemnation of world public opinion and frantically uses chemical poisons and gases in South Vietnam is also a manifestation of its extreme weakness. U.S. imperialism believes that by using this inhuman means, it can intimidate the Vietnamese people and save its failing fate. This is a complete delusion. The facts will be contrary to the wishes of U.S. imperialism. The more barbaric and cruel it is, the more it will arouse the Vietnamese people's determination to fight to the death, and the more it will prompt the people of the world to actively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, thereby accelerating the complete defeat of U.S. imperialism.

### 愤怒声讨美帝在南越疯狂使用毒药毒气

    我外交部发表声明重申坚决支持越南人民严正立场
    愤怒声讨美帝在南越疯狂使用毒药毒气
    美帝妄图使用这种惨无人道的手段，吓倒越南人民，挽救自己的失败命运，完全是痴心妄想。它愈是野蛮、凶残，就愈加激起越南人民誓死战斗的决心，就愈加促使全世界人民积极支持越南人民的正义斗争，从而加速它的彻底失败。
    新华社二十四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部二十四日发表声明，声讨美帝国主义在侵越战争中越来越疯狂地使用各种化学毒药和毒气残杀越南南方人民的滔天罪行，重申中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南人民的严正立场。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                        一九六六年三月二十四日
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中正在越来越疯狂地使用各种化学毒药和毒气，灭绝人性地残杀越南南方人民。三月十三日和二十二日，越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国外交部分别发表声明，列举大量事实向全世界强烈控诉美帝国主义这一罪恶行为，呼吁全世界爱好和平的国家和人民制止美帝国主义的侵略魔爪。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南人民的严正立场，并以无比愤怒的心情声讨美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行。
    几年来，美帝国主义一直把使用化学毒药和毒气当作它侵略越南南方的一种战争手段。随着美帝国主义在越南南方战场上的愈益失败和它扩大战争的步伐愈益加紧，它杀害越南人民的手段也就更加残暴。特别是最近，美帝国主义在越南南方发动的大规模“扫荡”中，使用化学毒药和毒气的范围越来越广泛，次数越来越频繁。不仅如此，约翰逊政府还公然宣布要把使用毒气看作是美国军队在“扫荡”中的一种“基本标准武器”，叫嚷今后还将继续大量使用。这就充分表明，美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中的野蛮行径，已经到了丧心病狂的地步！
    美帝国主义在越南南方所干的罪恶勾当，再一次揭开了约翰逊政府的画皮。檀香山会议以后，约翰逊政府仍然竭力表示它有和平解决越南问题的“诚意”，甚至装出一副慈善家的面孔，说什么要在南越实行“社会改革”、“向饥饿和疾病发动进攻”。但是，就是这个时候，美帝国主义却把侵略南越的战争强化到更加野蛮的地步，把多种高浓度的战争毒药和毒气撒放到越南南方，使大批和平居民被残杀，无数牲畜被毒害，几十万公顷的庄稼被毁坏。这一切表明，约翰逊政府的所有伪善言词和和平论调，只不过是它进行疯狂屠杀和野蛮战争的伴奏曲。人们从无数血的事实中清楚地知道，对于美帝国主义这样一个嗜血成性的强盗，决不能抱有任何幻想，而只能坚决地同它战斗到底。
    历史上一切没落的反动势力，在他们行将死亡的时候，总是要采取最残暴、最无耻的手段进行挣扎。美帝国主义不顾世界舆论的谴责，疯狂地在越南南方使用化学毒药和毒气，也是它极端虚弱的表现。美帝国主义以为，它使用这种惨无人道的手段，就可以吓倒越南人民，挽救自己的失败命运。这完全是痴心妄想。事实将同美帝国主义的愿望相反，它愈是野蛮、凶残，就愈加激起越南人民誓死战斗的决心，就愈加促使全世界人民积极支持越南人民的正义斗争，从而加速美帝国主义的彻底失败。
