    Identify the Main Gaps
    Using Jiao Yulu as a mirror, and comparing myself, I have five gaps: a gap in the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and thorough revolution; a gap in strong fighting will; a gap in deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants; and a gap in the working style of hard struggle, going deep into reality, and maintaining close ties with the masses. Why? The main reason is that I study Chairman Mao's writings poorly. In the future, I must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example and continuously realize my own ideological revolutionization.

    找出主要的差距
    以焦裕禄为镜子，对照自己，我有五差：全心全意为人民和彻底革命的精神差；坚强的斗争意志差；和贫下中农深厚的阶级感情差；艰苦奋斗、深入实际和联系群众的工作作风差。为什么？主要是自己学习毛主席著作差。今后要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，不断实现自己的思想革命化。
