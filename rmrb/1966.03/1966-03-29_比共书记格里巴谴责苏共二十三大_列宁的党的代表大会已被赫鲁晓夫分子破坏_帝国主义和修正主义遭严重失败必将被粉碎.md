    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th dispatch from Brussels: Ernest Burnelle, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium, published an article entitled "On the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" in the weekly "Le Drapeau Rouge" published on March 25th.
    The article pointed out that this congress has nothing in common with the congresses of Lenin's party.
    The article stated that people saw in the March 23rd issue of "Le Drapeau Rouge," the Belgian Khrushchevite newspaper, an article by the newspaper's correspondent in the Soviet Union about the so-called "23rd Congress of the CPSU" to be held in Moscow on March 29th.
    This article demonstrates the complete degeneration of the Soviet revisionists and their Belgian running dogs, as well as their complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the cause of the people. This is a thorough attack on the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    While praising the 20th Congress and Khrushchev's revisionist views, it made slanderous attacks on Comrade Stalin.
    The article said that what the revisionists hope for is that the working class, the laboring masses, and the people of all countries will abandon the use of revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, abandon the struggle to break free from shackles, and accept enslavement.
    The article pointed out that the Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations are insulted, slandered, and attacked by the Khrushchev revisionists because they steadfastly stand on the positions of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and consistently adhere to revolutionary struggle.
    The article said that the 23rd Congress of the CPSU has nothing in common with the congresses of Lenin's party, because Lenin's party congress has been temporarily sabotaged by the traitorous Khrushchev elements.
    The article said that in the Soviet Union, as in other countries under revisionist rule, there are Marxist-Leninists who represent the cause of socialist revolution, and this revolutionary cause will surely regain victory after the revisionist usurpers are driven out.
    The article said that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression in the world, but it is becoming increasingly isolated and is digging its own grave.
    Revisionism, which politically supports U.S. imperialism, is also increasingly exposing its true colors.
    The article concluded by pointing out that both imperialism and revisionism have suffered serious defeats.
    Revisionism will certainly be eliminated.
    The exploiters and oppressors, headed by U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world, will also be crushed.

    比共书记格里巴谴责苏共二十三大
    列宁的党的代表大会已被赫鲁晓夫分子破坏
    帝国主义和修正主义遭严重失败必将被粉碎
    新华社二十八日讯  布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴在二十五日出版的《人民之声》周刊上发表题为《关于苏联共产党第二十三次代表大会》的文章。
    文章指出，这次大会同列宁的党的代表大会毫无共同之处。
    文章说，人们在比利时赫鲁晓夫派的报纸《红旗》三月二十三日一期上看到该报驻苏记者写的一篇关于将在三月二十九日在莫斯科举行的所谓“苏共第二十三次代表大会”的文章。
    这篇文章表明了苏联修正主义者及其比利时走狗的完全蜕化以及他们对马列主义、无产阶级国际主义、人民的事业的彻底背叛。这是对马列主义的根本原则的彻头彻尾的攻击。
    它对第二十次代表大会和赫鲁晓夫的修正主义观点进行颂扬的同时，对斯大林同志进行了诽谤性的攻击。
    文章说，修正主义者所希望的是，工人阶级、劳苦大众和各国人民放弃用革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力，放弃挣脱枷锁的斗争，而接受奴役。
    文章指出，马克思列宁主义的党和组织之所以受到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的侮辱、诬蔑和攻击，是因为他们坚定不移地站在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义和一贯坚持革命斗争的立场上。
    文章说，苏共第二十三次代表大会同列宁的党的代表大会毫无共同之处，因为列宁的党的代表大会已暂时被叛徒赫鲁晓夫分子破坏了。
    文章说，在苏联如同在其它处在修正主义统治下的国家一样，有代表着社会主义革命事业的马克思列宁主义者，这一革命事业在修正主义篡夺者被赶走之后一定会重新获得胜利。
    文章说，美帝国主义在世界上变本加厉地进行侵略，但是它越来越孤立，正在自掘坟墓。
    在政治上支持美帝国主义的修正主义，也越来越暴露了自己的真面目。
    文章最后指出，帝国主义和修正主义都已经遭到严重失败。
    修正主义一定会被清除。
    以全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义为首的剥削者和压迫者也一定会被粉碎。
