    Newly Fledged Swallows
    Zhang Baoshan, Hongxing People's Commune, Daxing County
    In the Hongxing Commune, the story of the Nine Sisters is known everywhere. Speaking of these Nine Sisters, hey, they really aren't simple. In terms of age, they are only seventeen years old on average, and in terms of education, only two are junior high school graduates, the rest are all elementary school students. Last year, with the strong support of the Party branch, the Nine Sisters made a bold pledge to cultivate high-yield fields on the fifty-two mu of paddy fields allocated by the production team.
    Transplanting rice seedlings began, and only two of the Nine Sisters knew how to transplant, and even then, they were only so-so. The youngest, An Meizhen, said, "What do we do if we don't know how to transplant?" Everyone said: We'll learn as we go. Before the words had faded, they had all jumped into the water with their trousers rolled up, talking and laughing, rushing forward. One day, two days, three days... the sounds of laughter in the rice fields diminished, and the sisters all felt their backs ache and their legs hurt, and they couldn't muster any energy. An Meizhen was so tired that she didn't even want to talk, and as soon as there was a break, she lay on the ground and didn't want to move. Team leader Wang Xiurong was even more anxious. At the end of the day, others could transplant one mu of land, but what about them? Each of them could only transplant two or three fen of land, and the seedlings were crooked, not in rows or lines, what to do? She was both angry and anxious, and blurted out, "Can't you transplant faster! What's with all the dawdling!" This was like throwing salt into a fire, and Li Guimei retorted, "I don't know how to transplant, and I can't transplant a few fen of land even if I work myself to death. If we keep working like this, people will laugh at us in the fall. We might as well give it back to the team!" An Meizhen also pouted, "Xiurong, I can't take it anymore, my back aches and my legs hurt, and I get nagged at when I go home. Transfer me to another team." After work, as soon as Xiurong got home, her mother started nagging, "We are poor peasants, and we have to take the lead and be proactive when working in the team. I agree with all of this, but what's with the experiment and high yield? You don't have the skill, don't try to take on delicate work." Upon hearing this, Xiurong turned around and left the house, going straight to Party Branch Secretary Liu Jinsheng's home. As soon as Lao Liu saw her, he asked, "What's wrong? Your pout could tie up a donkey. Did you encounter difficulties!" Xiurong nodded, and Lao Liu said, "Difficulties are not to be feared. When you encounter difficulties, you must fight them." "How do you fight them?" Xiurong raised her head, and Lao Liu said, "You must read Chairman Mao's books, and there are methods of struggle in the books." He also said, "Don't worry, if you don't succeed this year, keep doing it next year. Anyway, you nine have contracted those fifty-two mu of land, but the most important thing is not to give up." After hearing these words, a determined light flashed in Xiurong's eyes, and she said as if swearing, "I will definitely listen to you, study Chairman Mao's writings well, and definitely complete the task assigned to us by the Party."
    That night, Xiurong organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Xiurong read it over and over, but no one spoke. Xiurong was very anxious: "What's wrong with everyone today!" Guimei said resentfully: "The Foolish Old Man was an ancient person, how can we learn from him? Besides, the Foolish Old Man removed mountains, and we are cultivating high-yield fields. These are two different things, how can they be related?" Xiurong was also tongue-tied and couldn't say anything. She originally thought: Everyone will understand as soon as they study Mao's Selected Works, and they will be motivated tomorrow! But now…. The meeting broke up unhappily.
    Xiurong dragged her slow footsteps and pushed open the door of her home. Wow! Lao Liu was waiting for her at home? Xiurong lowered her head and said after a long while: "I read it several times, but it didn't solve any problems." Lao Liu laughed heartily:
  "To study Mao's Selected Works, you must study with questions in mind, and you must know how to use what you learn. You must think about it in relation to practical problems. Besides, you are the group leader. When you encounter difficulties, you should think more about your comrades. Think about it again..."
    The next morning, the Nine Sisters were pulling rice sprouts together in the seedling fields. Xiurong said: "Let's have a life meeting while we work. Everyone should give me their opinions first. I am too impatient, I only care about speed, and I don't think about my comrades. I often get angry, which is very wrong." After hearing this, everyone started talking. Guimei said: "I didn't know how to transplant in the first place, and I was afraid that I would slow down the whole group because I was transplanting slowly. I was already anxious, and when you urged me, I became even more flustered and clumsy." After hearing this, Chen Shuzhen, who rarely spoke, chimed in: "However, we can't entirely blame Xiurong. She must have been very anxious when she saw that we were transplanting so slowly and poorly. It's all our fault for being clumsy." "Yes, it's all our fault for being too clumsy." Several sisters echoed. Xiurong hurriedly said, "We can't blame everyone, it was wrong of me to get angry, I will definitely change in the future. But our seedlings are not transplanted well. Last night I thought, if the Foolish Old Man could move the mountains away, if we had his ambition, even clumsy hands could become quick hands." These words hit everyone's hearts, and everyone fell into deep thought. Guimei broke the silence: "Xiurong is right, I will definitely learn actively in the future, and I must become a quick hand." The more they talked, the more congenial they became, and the rice fields became lively again. They finally overcame the transplanting hurdle, and the clear water surface was covered with a smooth green carpet, and everyone who saw it praised it.
    A new test awaited the Nine Sisters. At that time, some production teams had not finished transplanting, and in order to seize the season, the team decided to let the Nine Sisters go to support them. As soon as the Nine Sisters heard this news, they also thought: The seedlings have just been transplanted, if we go to support other teams, we won't be able to weed, what if it becomes barren? They opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and thought of Norman Bethune, and compared themselves. They said: "Norman Bethune was a foreigner, and he could come thousands of miles to help us Chinese fight the Japanese. Of course, we should help other teams transplant their seedlings." In this way, they took Chairman Mao's books and happily went to support other teams, completing the task in four days. But when they came back, they saw that the seedlings had already become barren. The girls were dumbfounded. Xiurong looked at the Chairman's writings in her hand and asked loudly, "Everyone, what should we do?" Guimei bit her lip and said firmly, "Learn from the Foolish Old Man. The land is barren, but we have nine pairs of hands. No difficulty is insurmountable. Weeding a piece of barren land reduces it by one piece. Sooner or later, we will weed the seedlings well." Xiurong then asked, "Is this right?" Everyone answered in unison: "Yes, no difficulty is insurmountable." The girls jumped into the fields and started working hard. At this time, the brigade broadcast said: "The brigade will show a movie tonight." Watching a movie, what a great attraction this was for the girls! Little Meizhen raised her head and asked hesitantly: "Should we watch the movie tonight?" "No!" This was the answer from several sisters. Xiurong walked up to Meizhen and said softly: "Meizhen, you've been tired enough these days, go home early tonight, rest, watch a movie, we'll do it here." Meizhen blushed and said: "If you don't go, I won't go either, I'll do it with you." The sky slowly darkened, and the girls sang songs, one revolutionary song after another, filling the empty fields.
    For several days in a row, the girls worked hard in the rice fields, with songs and laughter constantly. The villagers said: "These nine girls are really strange, where did they get such energy?" Lao Liu praised everyone he met: "These girls are really good, Chairman Mao's words really have a great effect!" The girls weeded the seedlings four times in a row. One day, the captain was passing by the edge of the field and said jokingly: "I won't give you work points for this overtime work." The nine girls answered in unison in the rice fields: "We are not doing it for work points, we are doing it for increased production, we will do it even if we don't get work points." This voice was so loud and so powerful, in this voice, it seemed as if one could hear the footsteps of the Nine Sisters moving forward!
    At the autumn harvest, the rice planted by the Nine Sisters reached a yield of a thousand catties per mu. This news spread quickly throughout the commune like wings, and the story of the Nine Sisters also spread throughout the commune. (Attached picture)

    雏燕初飞
    大兴县红星人民公社　张宝山
    在红星公社，到处流传着九姐妹的故事。提起这九姐妹，嘿，可真不简单。论年龄，平均只有十七岁，说文化，只有两个初中生，其他都是小学生。去年，在党支部的大力支持下，九姐妹立下了雄心壮志，在生产队拨给的五十二亩稻田上种起丰产田来。
    插秧开始了，九姐妹中只有两个人会插秧，还是二把刀。最小的安美珍说：“咱不会插秧怎么办呢？”大家说：边干边学呗。话音没落，一挽裤腿就都跳下水去，边说边笑，抢着往前赶。一天，二天，三天……稻田里的说笑声减少了，姐妹们都觉得腰酸腿疼，打不起精神来。安美珍累得连话也不愿说，一到歇歇儿，就躺在地上不愿动啦。组长王秀荣心里更急得火燎燎的。一天下来，别人可以插一亩地，她们呢？一人才插二、三分地，插的秧歪歪扭扭，行不成行，线不成线，怎么办呢？她又气又急，冲口就出“你们倒快点插呀！磨磨蹭蹭的象什么！”这就象一把盐撒进了火，李桂梅抢着说：“我又不会插秧，累死累活插不了几分地，照咱们这干法，秋后准让人家看哈哈笑，干脆，归大组吧！”安美珍也噘起了嘴：“秀荣，我顶不住啦，腰酸腿疼还不算，回家还挨说，把我调到别的组去吧。”收工后，秀荣一回家，她妈就唠叨开了“咱们是贫农，在队里干活要带头，要积极上进，这我全赞成，可搞什么试验、丰产，你没有金刚钻，愣揽这细磁活。”秀荣一听，扭身出了家门，直跑到党支书刘金生家。老刘一见她就问：“怎么啦，嘴噘得可以拴驴了，碰到困难了吧！”秀荣点点头，老刘说：“困难并不可怕，遇到了困难，就要和它斗。”“怎么斗呢？”秀荣抬起了头，老刘说：“要读毛主席的书，书里就有斗的法子。”又说
  “别担心，今年搞不成，明年接着干，反正那五十二亩地你们九个人包了，可最要紧的别打退堂鼓。”听了这些话，秀荣眼睛里闪出一道坚定的光，她象发誓般地说：“我一定听你的话，好好学习毛主席著作，一定要完成党交给我们的任务。”
    当晚，秀荣就组织大家学习《愚公移山》，秀荣念了一遍又一遍，可就是没人发言。秀荣很着急：“今天都怎么啦！”桂梅赌气地说：“人家愚公是古时候的人，咱们怎么学，再说愚公移山，咱们搞丰产田，这可是两码事，怎么扯一块去呢？”问得秀荣也张口结舌地说不上来。她原来只想：大家一学毛选就通，明儿个劲头就会来啦！可现在……。会就这样不欢而散。
    秀荣拖着慢吞吞的脚步刚推开家门。哟！老刘在家里等着她呢？秀荣低下头，半晌才说：“念了好几遍，可没解决什么问题。”老刘爽朗地笑起来：
  “学毛选，得带着问题学，会学还得会用。得联系实际问题去想。再说，你是小组领导，碰到困难，你要多为同志们想想，你再考虑考虑吧……”
    第二天清早，九姐妹在秧田里一起拔稻芽子，秀荣说：“咱们边干活边开个生活会吧，大家先给我提提意见。我脾气太急躁，光图快，不为同志们想，常常发火，这很不对。”听她这一说，大家的话匣子就打开了。桂梅说：“本来我就不会插秧，又怕因为自己插慢了影响全组，心里就够急的了，你再一催，我心里更慌，手上更乱了。”听了这话，平日很少说话的陈淑珍却接了话碴：“不过，也不能全怪秀荣，她看着我们插的又慢又差，心里该有多急，全怨我们的手笨。”“对，就怪我们手太笨了。”好几个姐妹应声说。秀荣忙说：“这不能怪大家，我发火是不对的，以后一定改。不过我们的秧是插得不好，昨晚上我想，愚公能把山搬走，我们要是有了他的志气，手笨的都可以变成手快的。”这话打中了大家的心坎，人人都陷入了沉思。还是桂梅打破了沉默：“秀荣说得对，以后我一定主动地学，一定要学成快手。”话越说越投机，稻田里重新欢腾起来。她们终于闯过了插秧关，清粼粼的水面，铺上了平整的绿毯，谁看了谁都夸一声好。
    一个新的考验在等待着九姐妹。当时有的生产队没插完秧，为了抢季节，队上决定让九姐妹去支援。九姐妹刚一听到这消息，也想：秧刚插下地，去支援外队，就不能挠了，荒了怎么办？她们打开了《纪念白求恩》，想想白求恩，比比自己。她们说：“人家白求恩是外国人，能不远万里来帮我们中国打日本，我们当然应该去帮外队把秧插下地。”就这样，她们带上了毛主席的书，高高兴兴地去支援外队，四天就完成了任务。可是回来一看，秧已经荒了。这下，姑娘们傻了眼，秀荣看了一下手中的主席著作，响亮地问：“大家看，该怎么办？”桂梅咬了咬嘴唇，坚定地说：“学愚公，地荒了，我们有九双手，困难再大没有克服不了的，荒地挠一块少一块，迟早要把秧挠好。”秀荣接着问：“这话对不对。”大家齐声回答：“对，没有克服不了的困难。”姑娘们跳下地里，埋头干起来。这时，大队广播说：“今晚上大队放映电影。”看电影，这对姑娘们是多大的吸引力啊！小美珍抬起头来，犹豫地问：“今晚的电影看不看？”“不看！”这是好几个姐妹的回答。秀荣走近美珍，轻轻地说：“美珍，这些天你够累的了，晚上早点回去，歇歇，看看电影，我们在这里搞就行了。”美珍脸一红说：“你们都不去，我也不去，跟你们一块儿搞。”天慢慢地暗下来了，姑娘们唱起了歌，一支又一支的革命歌曲，充实了空旷的田野。
    接连几天，姑娘们苦战在稻田里，歌声笑声不断。村里人说：“这九个丫头，真是邪了，哪来这么大的劲头儿？”老刘更是逢人便夸：“这伙姑娘，真是好样的，毛主席的话真是作用大呀！”姑娘们接连挠了四遍秧。一天，队长正从田边过，开玩笑地说：“你们这加班加点的，我可不给你们记工分。”九个姑娘在稻田里齐声回答：“我们不是为工分，为的是增产，不给工分也干。”这声音那么响亮，那么有力，在这声音里，好象听到了九姐妹前进的脚步声！
    秋收时，九姐妹种的水稻达到了亩产千斤，这消息便象长上了翅膀，飞快地在全公社传开了，九姐妹的故事也就在全公社传开了。（附图片）
