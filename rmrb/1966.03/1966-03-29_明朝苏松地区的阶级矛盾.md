    Class Contradictions in the Suzhou-Songjiang Area During the Ming Dynasty
    Shi Bing
    Summary: Among the general landlords in the Suzhou-Songjiang area during the Ming Dynasty, there were middle and small landlords, as well as large landlords. They were consistent with the local officials in exploiting the peasants, and the large landlords among them even more cruelly oppressed the peasants like the local officials, thus arousing strong resistance from the peasants. Comrade Wu Han said that the class struggle in the Suzhou-Songjiang area at that time was only the contradiction between peasants and local officials, and not the contradiction between peasants and the landlord class, which is contrary to historical reality.
    In his historical essays, especially in a series of historical essays and historical dramas about Hai Rui published from 1959 to 1961, Comrade Wu Han actually blurred the boundaries between peasants and the landlord class from all aspects, distorted and obliterated the class struggle between peasants and the landlord class, and promoted the "theory of class reconciliation." More seriously, Comrade Wu Han did not admit these mistakes in his "Self-Criticism on *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*," but continued to adhere to these mistakes. Therefore, we must further expose and criticize them. This article will only discuss the class contradictions in the Suzhou-Songjiang area during the Ming Dynasty.
    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han cited a large amount of historical data to analyze the class contradictions in the Suzhou-Songjiang area during the Ming Dynasty. He believed that the class contradiction in the Suzhou-Songjiang area at that time was the contradiction between peasants and local officials, not the contradiction between peasants and general landlords. Here, Comrade Wu Han rudely distorted the class struggle between peasants and the landlord class and tampered with the basic Marxist theory about class and class struggle.
    The main contradiction in Chinese feudal society was the contradiction between peasants and the landlord class. The fact that a part of the landlord class in the Suzhou-Songjiang area, the local officials, were tyrannical in their villages and caused a stronger resistance from the peasants indicates that the contradiction between the two classes tended to intensify. Comrade Wu Han avoided talking about the class contradictions, and particularly the intensifying class contradictions, in the Suzhou-Songjiang area at that time, but replaced the contradiction between peasants and the entire landlord class with the contradiction between peasants and local officials, saying that "the only plunderer in this area" was "the bureaucratic landlord group," that is, local officials like Xu Jie, while general landlords never plundered land. In this way, the class boundary between peasants and the landlord class was completely obliterated, and the intensifying contradiction was also misinterpreted.
    In order to prove that local officials were the "only plunderers" in the Suzhou-Songjiang area, Wu Han, when mentioning middle and small landlords, one-sidedly rendered how they were bullied and oppressed by local officials and expressed unlimited sympathy for them. On the contrary, he never mentioned how these middle and small landlords started by exploiting peasants, and the consistency between middle and small landlords and local officials in exploiting peasants.
    Is this really the case? In the Ming Dynasty, general landlords could be superficially divided into two types: "gentry" and "wealthy households." Whether gentry or wealthy households, according to their different economic status, they included large landlords, as well as middle and small landlords. It cannot be said that local officials represented large landlords, and general wealthy households were middle and small landlords. In the Ming Dynasty, Huangjing Market in Songjiang had "four major surnames, namely Zhang, Yang, Bao, and Gu... The Gu family has been rich for generations, and few study"①. The so-called Gu family here, although not local officials, was a large landlord in Huangjing Market. Many of the "major surnames," "major families," "large families," "rich people," "wealthy people," and "commoners" recorded by the Ming Dynasty people in Suzhou-Songjiang and other places started as grain chiefs and heads of villages, and most of them were not local officials. It was these people who, like the local officials, plundered the peasants' grain, enslaved the peasants' bodies, and promoted the exile of peasants in the context of land annexation and tax evasion, arousing the peasants' struggle of "robbing wealthy households" and "not paying rent to large families"②. However, Comrade Wu Han excluded wealthy households from local officials, and excluded middle and small landlords from large landlords, saying that the class contradiction in the Suzhou-Songjiang area was only the contradiction between peasants and local officials. Isn't this a distortion of history?
    During the period of Jiajing, Longqing, and the early Wanli years of the Ming Dynasty, in the five prefectures of Suzhou-Songjiang and their neighboring areas, peasant struggles of grabbing grain, resisting rent, and robbing government granaries, as well as various armed uprisings of famine victims, displaced people, "mine bandits," "salt smugglers," and White Lotus sect members, also occurred one after another. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing, there was the uprising of the White Lotus sect led by Jiang Peng and Jiang Chao on the southwest bank of Taihu Lake. In the thirty-eighth year of Jiajing, there was an uprising of famine victims forming "salt smugglers" in the Suzhou area. In the forty-first year of Jiajing, there was a great famine in Songjiang, and "famine victims went out to rob wealthy households"③. In the eighth year of Wanli, in Jiading, Suzhou, "peasants gathered in groups, and even took up poles and spears, looking for food from house to house." A few years later, the peasants in Jiaxing again "gathered parties and agreed not to pay rent to large families"④. During the years of Longqing three and four, when Hai Rui served as the governor of Yingtian, in Songjiang alone, "the people mostly thought of becoming thieves," and "thefts rose in swarms"⑤. All this shows that the peasants in the five prefectures of Suzhou-Songjiang resisted the cruel exploitation and oppression of the entire landlord class, not just the exploitation and oppression of local officials, and that the class contradiction in the Suzhou-Songjiang area was mainly the contradiction between peasants and the landlord class, and not the contradiction between peasants and local officials.
    We do not deny that the main target of the peasants' struggle against the landlord class in the Suzhou-Songjiang area at that time was some tyrannical local officials. Although local officials and wealthy households were essentially the same, they generally had the privilege of exemption from labor service, and those who entered the official-gentry group through the provincial and metropolitan examinations were mostly from the Southern Zhili area. Relying on their political power, they plundered land and oppressed the people in the local area, committing all kinds of evils. Therefore, the peasants in the Jiangnan area during the Ming Dynasty often rose up to resist local officials and even "killed local officials"⑥. Nevertheless, one cannot, like Comrade Wu Han, insist that there were only contradictions and struggles between peasants and local officials in the Suzhou-Songjiang area, and write off the contradictions and struggles between peasants and the landlord class.
    Then, what does Comrade Wu Han emphasize as the contradiction and struggle between peasants and local officials? His answer is escape, suing, or more precisely, "suing local officials for seizing property." This is also completely wrong.
    We do not deny that a small number of poor peasants, under the cruel oppression of local officials and wealthy households, harbored illusions about the feudal government and "Hai Qingtian," and therefore came to the government to sue local officials for seizing property. But it must be seen that there were also many peasants who could not tolerate the cruel oppression of the landlord class and rose up to fight them to the death. For example, a passage in *Yunjian Jumu Chao* records:
      "Suing was the old habit of the people of Songjiang, and it was not considered unusual. Since Duke Wenzhen (referring to Xu Jie) was dismissed from office as prime minister and Zheng (Gao Gong) was in power, there was a proposal for retaliation. Therefore, Governor Hai (Hai Rui) and Military Commissioner Cai were both interested in exploiting Xu, and those who made accusations rose up in droves... One day, Governor Hai inspected the South Surveillance Bureau to hear complaints, and the lawsuits piled up like a mountain. Hai felt it was impossible to read them all, so he took fire and burned them. At that time, the cunning people were all dressed in prison clothes and broken hats, usually in groups of fifty or sixty, waving their arms and shouting in the streets, and there were no less than a thousand people in front of and around the former prime minister's (Xu Jie's) mansion every day. Xu's people could not think of any solution, so they took stinky mud and manure and stored it at the door of the hall, and whenever someone entered, they splashed it with filth."⑦
    This mass demonstration was precisely a sharp class struggle aroused by the cruel exploitation of the landlord class, headed by the local official Xu Jie, against the local peasants. It shows that the broad masses of peasants fundamentally did not believe that problems could be solved through lawsuits, but adopted the method of directly fighting against the wealthy and powerful local officials; it also shows that the "Hai Qingtian" who "protected the poor" also revealed his true colors at this time, and could only burn the accumulated lawsuits.
    It is very clear that Comrade Wu Han emphasized that the class contradiction and struggle in the Suzhou-Songjiang area was the contradiction and struggle between peasants and local officials, and his purpose was to create a "theoretical" basis for *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* that he wrote. The Hai Rui depicted by Comrade Wu Han was originally standing on the position of the landlord class, starting from the long-term interests of feudal rule, to ease the increasingly acute contradiction between peasants and the landlord class. However, Comrade Wu Han repeatedly dressed Hai Rui as a "supra-class" figure who always stood on the side of the peasants in the so-called contradiction between local officials and peasants. It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han is still combining peasants and general landlords and wealthy households into one, and combining Hai Rui, a so-called "honest official" who is a member of the feudal ruling class, with peasants. Isn't this continuing to distort the history of class struggle and promote the theory of class reconciliation?

    明朝苏松地区的阶级矛盾
    史兵
    提要  明朝苏松地区的一般地主中有中、小地主，也有大地主。他们同乡官在剥削农民上是一致的，其中的大地主更同乡官一样残酷地欺压农民，因而激起农民的强烈反抗。吴晗同志说当时苏松地区的阶级斗争只是农民同乡官的矛盾，而不是农民同地主阶级的矛盾，这是违反历史实际的。
    吴晗同志在他所写的历史论文中，特别是从一九五九到一九六一年先后发表的一系列有关海瑞的历史论文和历史剧中，实际上是从各方面来模糊农民与地主阶级的界限，歪曲和抹煞农民与地主阶级的阶级斗争，宣扬了“阶级调和论”。更严重的是，吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文中，并没有承认这些错误，而是继续坚持这些错误。因此，我们必须予以进一步的揭露和批判。本文仅就明朝苏松地区的阶级矛盾问题作一些论述。
    吴晗同志在他的“自我批评”中，引证了大量历史资料来分析明朝苏松地区的阶级矛盾。他认为当时苏松地区的阶级矛盾是农民与乡官的矛盾，不是农民与一般地主的矛盾。在这里，吴晗同志粗暴地歪曲了农民与地主阶级的阶级斗争，篡改了马克思主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的基本理论。
    中国封建社会的主要矛盾是农民与地主阶级的矛盾，而明朝苏松地区地主阶级内部一部分乡官的横暴乡里，并引起农民更强烈的反抗，这是说明两个阶级的矛盾趋向激化。吴晗同志对当时苏松地区的阶级矛盾、而且是趋向激化的阶级矛盾避而不谈，却以农民与乡官的矛盾代替了农民与整个地主阶级的矛盾，说什么“这一地区唯一的掠夺者”就是“官僚大地主集团”，也就是象徐阶之流的乡官，而一般地主则从不掠夺土地。这样，农民与地主阶级之间的阶级界限就完全被抹煞了，趋向激化的矛盾也被曲解了。
    为了证明乡官是苏松地区的“唯一的掠夺者”，吴晗同志一提到中、小地主，就片面地渲染他们怎样受到乡官的欺凌和压迫，并寄予无限的同情。相反，他对于这些中、小地主如何以剥削农民起家，对于中、小地主与乡官在剥削农民上的一致性却只字不提。
    事实真是如此吗？在明朝，一般地主从表面看都可以分为“乡绅”和“富户”两种类型。无论乡绅或富户，按照其经济地位的不同，其中有大地主，也有中、小地主。不能说乡官就代表大地主，一般的富户就是中、小地主。明朝松江的潢泾市“有四巨姓，曰张、杨、包、顾……顾氏则代多富人，读书者少”①。这里所谓的顾氏虽不是乡官，却是潢泾市上的一家大地主。明朝人记载苏松等地的“巨姓”、“巨室”、“大家”、“富者”、“财主”和“布衣”，很多人都以粮长、里长起家，其中大部分也不是乡官。正是这些人与乡官一样地掠夺了农民的粮食，奴役了农民的人身，又在土地兼并、逃赋避役的情况下促成农民的流亡，激起了农民“抢掠富户”和“毋输租巨室”的斗争②。而吴晗同志却把富户排斥于乡官之外，把中、小地主排斥于大地主之外，说苏松地区的阶级矛盾只是农民与乡官的矛盾，这不是对历史的歪曲又是什么呢？
    在明朝嘉靖、隆庆和万历初年的一段时期里，苏松五府及其邻近地区，农民抢粮、抗租、劫府库的斗争以及饥民、流民、“矿贼”、“盐徒”、和白莲教徒的各种武装起义也此起彼伏，先后不断发生。嘉靖三十六年，太湖西南岸有白莲教蒋鹏、蒋潮的起义。嘉靖三十八年，苏州地区有饥民结“盐徒”的起义。嘉靖四十一年，松江大饥，“饥民四出抢掠富户”③。万历八年，苏州嘉定“农民赘聚呼，甚则操竿揭挺，望屋而食”，几年后，嘉兴的农民又“聚党相约，毋输租巨室”④。在海瑞出任应天巡抚的隆庆三年和四年之间，仅松江一地，就是“民多思盗”，“盗蜂起”⑤。这一切都说明了苏松五府农民所反抗的是整个地主阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，而不只是反抗乡官的剥削和压迫，苏松地区的阶级矛盾主要是农民与地主阶级的矛盾，而不是什么农民与乡官的矛盾。
    我们不否认当时苏松地区农民对地主阶级的斗争，其主要锋芒是指向某些横暴乡里的乡官。乡官与富户在本质上虽然相同，但一般都具有免役的特权，而通过乡试、会试进入官绅集团的人，又以南直隶地区为最多。他们凭借政治势力，在地方上掠夺土地、欺压乡民，无恶不作。因此，明朝江南地区的农民也经常起来反抗乡官甚至“杀乡官”⑥。尽管如此，也不能象吴晗同志那样硬说苏松地区只有农民与乡官的矛盾和斗争，而把农民与地主阶级的矛盾和斗争一笔勾销。
    那末，吴晗同志所强调的农民与乡官的矛盾和斗争究竟指的是什么呢？他的回答是逃亡、告状，更确切地说，是“告乡官夺产”。这也是完全错误的。
    我们不否认有少数的贫苦农民，在乡官、富户的残酷压迫下，对封建的官府和“海青天”抱有幻想，因此来官衙告乡官夺产。但是必须看到，还有许多农民不能容忍地主阶级的残酷压迫，起来与他们进行生死的斗争。例如《云间据目钞》的一段记载：
      “刁告乃松人故态，而未为异常，自文贞公（指徐阶）罢相，适新郑（高拱）当国，有报复之议，故巡抚海公（海瑞）、兵宪蔡公皆有意渔肉徐，而告讦者遂乘风纷起。……一日，海公按临南察院放告，词讼堆积如山，海度不可阅，取火焚之。时刁民皆囚服破帽，率以五六十为群，沿街攘臂，叫喊号呼，而元辅（徐阶）三第，前后左右，日不下千余人。徐人计无所出，第取臭泥粪贮积厅门，见拥者入，辄泼污之。”⑦
    这种群众性的示威，正是当地农民在以乡官徐阶为首的地主阶级的残酷剥削下，所激发出的一场尖锐的阶级斗争。它说明广大农民根本不相信通过告状能够解决问题，而采用了向乡官豪富直接斗争的办法；也说明那个“卵翼贫民”的“海青天”在此时也原形毕露，对于堆积如山的词讼只好一烧了之。
    非常明显，吴晗同志强调苏松地区的阶级矛盾和斗争是农民与乡官的矛盾和斗争，其目的是要为他所写的《海瑞罢官》制造“理论”的根据。吴晗同志所描绘的海瑞原来明明是站在地主阶级的立场上，从封建统治的长远利益出发，来缓和当时日益尖锐的农民与地主阶级的矛盾的。但是，吴晗同志却一再把海瑞打扮成一个在所谓乡官与农民的矛盾中始终站在农民一边的“超阶级”的人物。可见吴晗同志仍然是把农民与一般地主富户合二而一，把作为封建统治阶级一员的所谓“清官”海瑞与农民合二而一，难道这不是继续在歪曲阶级斗争历史、宣扬阶级调和论吗？
