    Our Embassy Lodges Two Notes with the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry
    Strongest Protest Against Ghana's Malicious Slander
    Ghana's Attempt to Escape its Guilt for Wantonly Destroying Sino-Ghanaian Relations Will Never Succeed. It Must Bear Full Responsibility for Damaging Bilateral Relations.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The Chinese Embassy in Ghana sent a note to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry on the 6th, lodging the strongest protest with the Ghanaian side regarding the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry's baseless accusation in its note of the 4th that the Chinese government "is assisting Kwame Nkrumah in returning to Ghana to carry out counter-revolution through various means." The full text of the Chinese Embassy's note is as follows:

    To the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry:
        The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Ghana presents its compliments to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry and states the following regarding the Foreign Ministry's note of March 4, 1966:
        In its note, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry groundlessly accuses that "the government of the People's Republic of China is assisting the deposed regime of Kwame Nkrumah in various ways," and that "the government of the People's Republic of China has begun transporting large quantities of weapons and other combat materials to the Republic of Guinea to help Kwame Nkrumah return to Ghana to carry out counter-revolution." This is entirely a fabrication by the Ghanaian side and a malicious slander against the Chinese government, and it is another serious provocation after a series of actions taken by the Ghanaian side to deliberately worsen Sino-Ghanaian relations. To this, the Chinese government cannot but lodge the strongest protest with the Ghanaian side.
        In its note, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry even distorts the facts and babbles that the Chinese government should "bear full responsibility for the consequences of any unfriendly actions of its own," attempting to shift the responsibility for the deterioration of Sino-Ghanaian relations to China. But the opposite is true. It is the Ghanaian side that has taken a series of serious steps to worsen bilateral relations: unreasonably detaining and brutally beating Chinese experts and Chinese Embassy staff; unilaterally tearing up the Sino-Ghanaian economic and technical cooperation agreement, unreasonably demanding that all Chinese experts withdraw immediately and reducing the number of Chinese Embassy personnel; and creating all kinds of difficulties and personal insults to the Chinese personnel who were forced to evacuate Accra. All of this clearly shows that the responsibility for the deterioration of bilateral relations does not lie with the Chinese side, but with the Ghanaian side. The Chinese government solemnly points out that the Ghanaian side must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.
        Please accept the expression of the highest consideration.

              Accra, March 6, 1966

    Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The Chinese Embassy in Ghana replied to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry on March 19th, refuting the Ghanaian side's note of March 16th, which wantonly slandered China, and lodging the strongest protest with the Ghanaian side regarding its disregard for China's repeated protests, its repeated malicious defamation of China, its distortion of facts, and its attempt to shift the responsibility for damaging bilateral relations to China. The full text of the Chinese Embassy's note is as follows:

    To the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry:
        The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Ghana presents its compliments to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry and, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, states the following regarding the Foreign Ministry's note of March 16, 1966:
        In its note, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry groundlessly slanders China for "deliberately interfering in Ghana's internal affairs," falsely accusing Chinese personnel of "having helped train saboteurs in Ghana," and baselessly accusing the Chinese side of "creating difficulties and mistreating" members of the Ghanaian Embassy in China. This is clearly an attempt by the Ghanaian side to create an excuse for its recent unreasonable expulsion of three diplomatic officials from the Chinese Embassy and to shirk its responsibility for deliberately worsening Sino-Ghanaian relations. The Chinese government expresses its utmost indignation at the Ghanaian side's disregard for China's repeated protests, its repeated malicious defamation of China, its distortion of facts, and its attempt to shift the responsibility for damaging bilateral relations to China, and once again lodges the strongest protest with the Ghanaian side.
        As everyone knows, the military experts sent by the Chinese government to work in Ghana, like the economic and technical experts, were dispatched at the request of the government of the Republic of Ghana and in accordance with the relevant agreements between the two countries, and have consistently worked according to the arrangements of the Ghanaian government, which is beyond reproach and cannot be distorted by anyone.
        In accordance with the norms of international relations, the Chinese side has always treated members of the Ghanaian Embassy in China in a friendly manner, providing them with various conveniences and assistance. Even after the Ghanaian side took a series of actions to worsen bilateral relations, the Chinese side still adopted a friendly attitude towards them and granted them the diplomatic privileges they were entitled to. The Ghanaian side's accusations in this regard are completely unfounded.
        In its note, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry even repeats the so-called lie in its note of March 4 to the Chinese Embassy that China "has transported large quantities of weapons to Conakry in order to help the deposed Kwame Nkrumah organize a counter-revolution in Ghana." The Chinese Embassy made a solemn refutation of this in its protest note of March 6, pointing out that this was entirely a fabrication by the Ghanaian side and a deliberate slander against the Chinese government. The Chinese government expresses its utmost dissatisfaction with the Ghanaian side's continuous fabrication of such absurd rumors.
        The facts are very clear that the series of accusations made by the Ghanaian side against China in its note are completely groundless. The Ghanaian side's attempt to escape its guilt for unreasonably expelling Chinese diplomatic officials and wantonly destroying bilateral relations is completely futile and will never succeed. The Chinese government reiterates that the Ghanaian side must bear full responsibility for damaging bilateral relations.

    我大使馆两次照会加纳外交部
    最强烈抗议加纳方面的恶意诬蔑
    加纳方面妄图逃脱它肆意破坏中、加两国关系的罪责是永远不会得逞的。它必须承担破坏两国关系的全部责任。
    新华社十九日讯  中国驻加纳大使馆六日照会加纳外交部，对加纳外交部在四日来照中毫无根据地指责中国政府
  “正以多种方式”“帮助克瓦米·恩克鲁玛重返加纳进行反革命”这一对中国政府的恶意诬蔑和严重挑衅，向加纳方面提出最强烈的抗议。中国大使馆的照会全文如下：加纳外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻加纳共和国大使馆向加纳外交部致意，并就外交部一九六六年三月四日来照声明如下：
    加纳外交部在来照中，毫无根据地指责“中华人民共和国政府正以多种方式，援助被废黜的克瓦米·恩克鲁玛政权”，“中华人民共和国政府已开始向几内亚共和国运送大量武器和其他作战物资，以帮助克瓦米·恩克鲁玛重返加纳进行反革命”。这完全是加纳方面的凭空捏造和对中国政府的恶意诬蔑，也是加纳方面蓄意恶化中、加两国关系采取一系列行动之后的又一次严重挑衅。对此，中国政府不能不向加纳方面提出最强烈的抗议。
    加纳外交部在来照中竟然颠倒是非，胡说什么中国政府应对自己的“任何不友好行为所带来的后果负全部责任”，企图把恶化中、加两国关系的责任转嫁给中国。但是事实恰恰相反，正是加纳方面采取了一系列恶化两国关系的严重步骤：无理扣押和残暴殴打中国专家和中国大使馆工作人员；片面撕毁中、加经济技术合作协定，无理要求所有中国专家立即撤退，并减少中国大使馆人员；对被迫撤离阿克拉的中国人员百般刁难，进行人身侮辱。所有这一切清楚地说明，恶化两国关系的责任不在中国方面，而在加纳方面。中国政府严正指出，由此所产生的一切严重后果，加纳方面必须承担全部责任。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。

    新华社十九日讯中国驻加纳大使馆三月十九日复照加纳外交部，驳斥加纳方面的三月十六日肆意诋毁中国的来照，并且就加纳方面无视中国的历次抗议，再次恶意诽谤中国，颠倒是非，妄图把破坏两国关系的责任转嫁给中国的行径，对加纳方面提出最强烈的抗议。中国大使馆的照会全文如下：加纳外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻加纳共和国大使馆向加纳外交部致意，并奉中华人民共和国政府之命，就外交部一九六六年三月十六日来照声明如下：
    加纳外交部在来照中，竟然无中生有地诋毁中国“蓄意干涉加纳的内政”，诬指中国人员“曾帮助在加纳训练破坏分子”，并且毫无根据地指责中国方面“刁难和虐待”加纳驻华大使馆的成员。这显然是加纳方面企图为它最近无理驱逐中国大使馆三位外交官员制造借口，推卸它蓄意恶化中、加两国关系的责任。中国政府对加纳方面无视中国的历次抗议，再次恶意诽谤中国，颠倒是非，妄图把破坏两国关系的责任转嫁给中国的行径，不能不表示极大的愤慨，并且再次向加纳方面提出最强烈的抗议。
    众所周知，中国政府派往加纳工作的军事专家同经济技术专家一样，都是应加纳共和国政府的要求、根据两国的有关协定派出的，并且一贯按照加纳政府的安排进行工作，是无可非议的，也是任何人歪曲不了的。
    中国方面根据国际关系准则，一贯友好地接待加纳驻华大使馆成员，向他们提供各种便利和协助。甚至在加纳方面采取了一系列恶化两国关系的行动以后，中国方面仍然对他们采取友好态度，给予他们应享有的外交特权。加纳方面在这方面的指责，是根本没有道理的。
    加纳外交部在来照中，竟再次重复它三月四日致中国大使馆照会中提出的所谓中国“已将大量武器运往科纳克里，以便帮助被黜免的克瓦米·恩克鲁玛在加纳组织一次反革命”的谎言。对此，中国大使馆早在三月六日的抗议照会中就作出了严正的驳斥，指出这完全是加纳方面的凭空捏造和对中国政府的蓄意诬蔑。中国政府对加纳方面不断制造这种谰言不能不表示极大的不满。
    事实非常清楚，加纳方面在来照中对中国提出的一系列指责都是没有任何根据的。加纳方面企图以此来逃脱它无理驱逐中国外交官员、肆意破坏两国关系的罪责是完全徒劳的，也是永远不会得逞的。中国政府再次严正指出，加纳方面必须承担破坏两国关系的全部责任。
