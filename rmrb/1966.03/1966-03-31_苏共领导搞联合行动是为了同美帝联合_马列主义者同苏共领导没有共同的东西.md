    Italian monthly "The Communist" Reveals Soviet Leadership's Conspiracy to Divide the World with U.S. Imperialism
    Soviet Leadership Engages in Joint Actions to Unite with U.S. Imperialism
    Marxist-Leninists Have Nothing in Common with the Soviet Leadership
    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: The Italian monthly "The Communist," in its December 1965 issue, published an article entitled "The Soviet Leaders' False Anti-Imperialism," pointing out that the goal of the Soviet Union's current political line is to divide the world with U.S. imperialism. Marxist-Leninists clearly have nothing in common with the Soviet revisionist leaders, and the basic task of Marxist-Leninists is to expose the so-called anti-imperialist united front propagated by the Soviet Union.
    The article states: The attitude towards the Vietnam War is the watershed distinguishing true anti-imperialism from false anti-imperialism. The article says that the Soviet Union is not interested in the Vietnam War ending with the defeat of the American aggressors. In fact, this is contradictory to its policy of peaceful coexistence, because it clearly shows that imperialism can only be defeated in one way: not by peaceful coexistence with it, but by fighting it to the end.
    The article says that the Soviet Union wants a settlement in Vietnam, a settlement that provides a "decent" way out for the American aggressors. In short, the Soviet Union is doing its utmost to seek a decent way out for these culprits of humanity. In carrying out this shameful activity, it receives the fraternal encouragement of all the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, especially the U.S. State Department.
    The article points out that the Soviet leaders, as the greatest splitters of modern times, want to turn the failure of their policy towards U.S. imperialism into a victory for splitting activities in the international communist movement. In fact, they shamelessly lie that the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government are the basic reasons why the Vietnam problem has not been resolved; they shamelessly lie that the Chinese comrades do not want an anti-imperialist united front, which has affected the possibility of defeating U.S. imperialism. It is very clear that attempting to help the Americans find a "decent" way out in Vietnam while at the same time propagating the unity of an anti-imperialist front that can crush American aggression in Vietnam are two completely different prospects.
    The article emphasizes that the Chinese Communist Party's resolute exposure of the Soviet Union's attempt to help the United States in the Vietnam issue has, in fact, made a great contribution to strengthening the anti-imperialist struggle. Because uniting with the Soviet revisionists means uniting on the basis of abandoning the anti-imperialist struggle to the end; and uniting on this basis is precisely indirectly cooperating with U.S. imperialism. The truth today is this: the anti-imperialist united front that the Soviet leaders are propagating today is a union of all those who are prepared to make concessions to U.S. blackmail, a union of all those who are prepared to coexist peacefully with U.S. imperialism and submit to it. Today, exposing the deception of this kind of union is a basic task of Marxist-Leninists.
    The article says, what consequences will actually arise from carrying out the anti-imperialist united struggle according to the Soviet viewpoint? What is the basis for carrying out this struggle? What kind of prospects will this struggle lead the anti-imperialist peoples of all countries to? A look at the Soviet Union's false neutralist attitude in the Indo-Pakistani conflict is enough to answer these questions. This false attitude conceals its actual support for the policies of the U.S. government. Whether it was the Soviet government's intervention in the United Nations or its comprehensive intervention in the revisionist parties, it was all guided by the principle that a ceasefire must be achieved between the two sides as soon as possible, without judging who the aggressor was and without condemning the aggression.
    In short, the Soviets showed in the Indo-Pakistani conflict that they are those who do not consider the guilt of the aggressor and the complaints of the victim, but prefer to join forces with the U.S. imperialists and priests to pray for a ceasefire.
    The article says that the convergence of U.S. and Soviet views clearly proves that the goal of the Soviet Union's political line today is to divide the world with U.S. imperialism. Thus, the line of peaceful coexistence is the line of Soviet-U.S. division of the world. Is there anything in common with the Soviet revisionist leaders? Obviously not. As the Chinese comrades said well, in this regard, they have nothing in common with the views of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

### 苏共领导搞联合行动是为了同美帝联合  马列主义者同苏共领导没有共同的东西

专栏：

    意大利《共产主义者》月刊揭露苏共领导同美帝瓜分世界阴谋
    苏共领导搞联合行动是为了同美帝联合
    马列主义者同苏共领导没有共同的东西
    新华社三十日讯  意大利《共产主义者》月刊一九六五年十二月一期发表了一篇题为《苏联领导人的假反帝》的文章指出，苏联今天的政治路线的目标是同美帝国主义一起瓜分世界，马克思列宁主义者同苏联修正主义领导人显然没有什么共同的东西，马克思列宁主义者的基本任务就是要揭露苏联宣扬的所谓反帝联合阵线。
    文章说：对越南战争的态度是区分真反帝还是假反帝的分水岭。文章说，苏联并不对越南战争以美国侵略者的失败而告终感兴趣。事实上这是同它的和平共处政策相矛盾的，因为，这清楚地表明帝国主义只有用一种方法才能被打败：不是同它和平共处，而是同它斗争到底。
    文章说，苏联是要在越南媾和，以这一种媾和作为美国侵略者“体面的”出路。总之，苏联竭力为这些人类的罪魁祸首谋求体面的出路。在进行这一可耻的活动时，它得到美帝国主义所有走狗，特别是得到美国国务院兄弟般的鼓励。
    文章指出，作为当代最大的分裂主义者的苏联领导人，想把他们对美帝国主义的政策的失败变成在国际共产主义运动中进行分裂活动的胜利。事实上，他们恬不知耻地扯谎说，中国共产党和中国政府的政策是越南问题没有得到解决的基本原因；他们恬不知耻地扯谎说，中国同志不要反帝统一战线，这使战胜美帝国主义的可能性受到了影响。很清楚，企图帮助美国人在越南谋求一条“体面的”出路，同时又宣扬能够粉碎美国在越南的侵略活动的反帝阵线的团结，这是两种绝然不同的前途。
    文章强调指出，中国共产党人对苏联在越南问题上帮助美国的企图采取坚决揭露的态度，事实上对加强反帝斗争做了不少的贡献。因为同苏联修正主义者联合就意味着在放弃把反帝斗争进行到底的基础上联合；而在这个基础上进行联合恰恰就是间接地同美帝国主义进行合作。今天的真相就是这样的：苏联领导人今天宣扬的反帝阵线的联合就是一切准备向美国讹诈让步的人的联合，就是一切准备同美帝国主义进行和平共处并屈从于美帝的人的联合。今天，揭露这种联合的欺骗性是马列主义者的一项基本任务。
    文章说，按照苏联观点进行反帝统一斗争实际上会产生什么后果呢？什么是开展这种斗争的基础呢？这一斗争将会把反帝的各国人民引到什么样的前景中去呢？看一看苏联在印巴冲突中采取的虚假的中立主义态度就足以回答这些问题了。这一虚假态度掩盖了它对美国政府政策的实际支持。苏联政府无论是在联合国内进行的干预，还是对修正主义各党进行的全面干预也好，都贯穿着必须尽快在双方之间实现停战局面的指导路线，而没有判断究竟是谁侵略，没有谴责这种侵略。
    总而言之，苏联人在印巴冲突中表现出他们是那些不考虑侵略者的罪责和被侵略者的申诉，而宁愿伙同美帝国主义者和神父来祈求停火。
    文章说，美苏观点的一致，清楚地证明了今天苏联政治路线的目标在于同美帝国主义一起分割世界。因而和平共处路线就是苏美瓜分世界的路线。难道同苏联修正主义领导人有什么共同东西吗？显然没有，中国同志说得好，在这方面，他们没有什么东西同苏联共产党的观点是一致的。
