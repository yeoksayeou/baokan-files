    Hydraulic Crane Arm - A Good Helper for Loading and Unloading Workers
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou – The Shaowu Automobile Repair Factory of the Fujian Forestry Industry Bureau has produced a hydraulic crane arm for timber trucks.
    Like a dexterous and powerful giant hand, it can grab logs weighing more than 1,300 kilograms and place them steadily onto the truck, loading a whole truckload of timber in fifteen minutes. In contrast, manual loading typically requires eight to ten people working for more than half an hour.
    This hydraulic crane arm is installed at the rear of the truck's cab or at the front of the flatbed trailer. The clamping, lifting, and steering of the wood are all hydraulically driven during operation. It has a simple and compact structure, is easy to operate, and is suitable not only for loading and unloading trucks and flatbed trailers in stockpile yards, mountain areas, and roadsides, but also for loading and unloading trains in timber yards. In addition to lifting logs, it can also be used to lift and unload different goods such as building materials, steel, and cement with slight modifications to its gripper.

    液压起重臂——装卸工人的好助手
    新华社福州电　福建森林工业局邵武汽车保修厂制成一台运材汽车液压起重臂。
    它象一只灵巧而有力的巨手，能把一千三百多公斤重的原木抓起来，平稳地放到车上，十五分钟就装完了一车木材。而要用人工装车，一般需要八到十人工作半个多小时。
    这种液压起重臂装在汽车驾驶室的后端，或装在平板挂车的前端，在工作过程中对木材的夹持、吊运、转向，全部采用液压驱动。它的结构简单、紧凑，操作轻便，不但适用于堆头山场、公路边等作业场地的汽车、平板挂车的装卸，并且适用于贮木场装卸火车；不但可以吊运原木，把它的夹具稍加改进之后，还可以用于建筑材料、钢材、水泥等不同货物的吊运装卸。
