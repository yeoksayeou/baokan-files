    To Learn from Daqing, First Learn the Daqing Spirit
    In the past, when we learned from Daqing, we simply copied certain systems, and the effect was not good. Now, when we learn from Daqing, we first learn from the people of Daqing, emphasizing politics, and the situation is very different.
    Our workshop has been learning from Daqing for more than two years. After a tortuous process, we have only recently figured out the way to learn from Daqing, which is: to learn from Daqing, we must first learn the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing, and not simply copy certain systems of Daqing.
    When we started learning from Daqing in 1963, the leading cadres only told us at the meeting to learn Daqing's "Three Olds" and "Four Stricts" system, and to learn from them in carrying out technical innovation and diligently practicing hard skills. However, they did not help the workers solve problems ideologically. After a few days, some people stopped strictly implementing the rules, and the cadres stopped coming to "work shifts" at night. Some people saw that the cadres were just making empty promises and also slacked off. After more than half a year like this, learning from Daqing became "tight at first, then loose, and finally nothing."
    In the fourth quarter of last year, our workshop re-learned from Daqing. This time, the leading cadres of the factory repeatedly told everyone the importance of learning from Daqing, and organized everyone to study relevant documents about Daqing. The workshop leaders made a self-criticism at the workers' congress, pointing out that in the past, they only learned other people's systems and did not learn from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing, did not emphasize politics, and only pursued form. So the entire workshop did not learn well from Daqing. On the basis of everyone's conscious effort, an activity of finding shortcomings and lessons was launched, and the entire workshop found a total of seventy-two shortcomings. The most fundamental difference between us and Daqing is that we did not emphasize politics and did not study Chairman Mao's books well. The main lesson is that we only learned the form, not the spirit, only posed, and did not produce real strength.
    After we found the shortcomings, we used the "arrow" of the Daqing spirit to shoot at our own "target" of realizing revolutionization, and learned from the people of Daqing in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The workshop leaders also really began to pay attention to emphasizing politics. Especially recently, we have been able to persist in studying Chairman Mao's works for one hour every day. The more we workers study Chairman Mao's books, the more we love to study them, and the brighter we feel in our hearts. In the past, we felt that working in a chemical plant, the smell in the workshop was unpleasant, the technology was low, and there was no future. Now we understand that doing chemical work is for the revolution. Everyone can consciously abide by the rules in operation. In order to realize the Third Five-Year Plan, we launched an activity to practice hard skills. In practicing our skills, we started from strictness and difficulty. Previously, some people suggested that being able to operate with the lights off at night should be considered skilled, but they felt that it was too difficult and could not be achieved. Now, when we see the Chairman Mao's quotations plaque on the operating table and think of the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing, we feel energetic all over. After a period of diligent study and hard practice, everyone can now operate skillfully with the lights off at night. We have been learning from Daqing every year, but now it is different. Because this time we first learned from the people of Daqing, emphasizing politics, the Daqing spirit is engraved in our hearts and put into practice. Now we have seen preliminary results. Take the chlorobenzene section as an example, in 1963, it was operated by fifty-four people, but now it is operated by only sixteen people, and the monthly output has increased by 155 tons compared to the past. The main technical and economic indicators have jumped into the national advanced ranks.
    Now, everyone in our workshop, from top to bottom, has high confidence and great enthusiasm, and is determined to truly learn the Daqing spirit, vow to be a "Wang Tie-Ren" style worker, and build a Daqing-style workshop. Workers of the Seventh Workshop of Taiyuan Chemical Plant.

    学大庆先要学大庆精神
    过去我们学大庆只是照搬某些制度，效果不好。现在学大庆先学大庆人突出政治，情况就大不一样了。
    我们车间学大庆有二年多了，经过一段曲折的过程，直到最近才算摸到了学大庆的门路，这就是：学大庆首先要学大庆人的革命精神，不能单纯照搬大庆的某些制度。
    一九六三年开始学大庆的时候，领导干部只是在会上给我们讲要学大庆“三老”“四严”的制度，学人家大搞技术革新和苦练硬功。但没从思想上帮助工人解决问题，没过几天，就有些人不再严格执行了，干部夜间也不来“上岗”了。有些人一看干部尽放空炮，也跟着松下来了。这样过了半年多的时间，学大庆就变成了“一紧二松三落空”。
    去年第四季度，我们车间重新学习大庆。这次学大庆，厂里领导干部反复给大家讲学大庆的重要意义，并组织大家学习有关大庆的文件。车间领导在职工大会上作了检查，指出过去只是学习人家的制度，没从大庆人的革命精神学起，没有突出政治，只是追求形式，所以全车间没学好大庆。在大家自觉的基础上，就掀起了找差距、找教训的活动，全车间总共找出七十二条差距。我们和大庆的差距最根本的一条，是没有突出政治，没有好好读毛主席的书；这教训那教训，主要是只学形式，不学精神，只摆样子，不出实力。
    我们找到了差距，就以大庆精神之“矢”，射自己如何实现革命化之“的”，学习大庆人那样活学活用毛主席著作。车间领导也真正重视突出政治了。特别是最近以来，我们每天都能坚持学习一个钟头的毛主席著作。我们工人越学毛主席的书就越爱学，越学心里越豁亮。过去觉得在化工厂工作，车间里的气味难闻，技术低，没前途，现在懂得了干化工是为了革命。大伙在操作中，都能自觉地遵守制度。为了实现第三个五年计划，开展了练硬功活动。练功中，我们从严、从难出发。以前有人提出，要在夜间关了灯能操作才算过硬，觉得这太难了，达不到。现在我们一看到操作台上的毛主席语录牌，一想到大庆人的革命精神，就浑身来劲，经过一番勤学苦练，现在大家都能在夜间关了灯熟练地操作了。年年学大庆，如今不一般。由于这次是先学大庆人突出政治，所以就把大庆精神刻在心上，落到实处。现在已初步见到了效果。就拿氯苯工段来说吧，一九六三年是五十四个人操作，如今只有十六人操作，月产量却比过去提高了一百五十五吨；主要技术经济指标跃入了全国先进行列。
    现在，我们车间上上下下信心都很高，劲头很足，决心把大庆精神真正学到手，誓做“王铁人”式的工人，建成大庆式的车间。太原化工厂七车间工人
