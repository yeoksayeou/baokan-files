    Open the Treasure Trove of Traditional Chinese Medicine to Serve the People of China and the World
    Western Medicine Practitioners Must Persistently Study Traditional Chinese Medicine
    More Than 300 Beijing Western Medicine Practitioners Hold Symposium on Inheriting and Developing the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Recently, Beijing’s medical community held a symposium to discuss how to inherit and develop the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. More than 300 attending physicians and hospital directors of Western medicine participated in the symposium. They unanimously agreed that traditional Chinese medicine contains the rich experience and theoretical knowledge of the Chinese people in their fight against disease, and is a great treasure trove. In order to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to contribute to the medical and health undertakings of our country and the world, medical workers must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine, earnestly study traditional Chinese medicine, and use their own scientific knowledge to closely cooperate with practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to jointly do a good job in researching and organizing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Shi Xiuzhu, Deputy Director of the Infectious Diseases Department of Beijing Children's Hospital, and Li Weifan, Deputy Director of the Surgery Department of the China-Soviet Friendship Hospital, respectively reported on their experiences of studying traditional Chinese medicine while on the job and after leaving their posts. They used their own practical experience to show that Western medicine practitioners can greatly improve medical efficacy by studying traditional Chinese medicine, learning from each other's strengths, and using both traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment methods as needed.
    Shi Xiuzhu, who has been working in Western medicine for more than ten years, has persisted in studying traditional Chinese medicine on the job for ten years. When she first started learning traditional Chinese medicine, she was afraid that she would forget Western medicine and become a "neither fish nor fowl." However, practice proved that her professional level not only did not decline, but she also learned more skills. From 1958 to 1962, viral pneumonia was prevalent in Beijing, seriously threatening the health of children. At first, Shi Xiuzhu and her colleagues only used Western medicine diagnostic and treatment methods to rescue patients, using antibiotics, infusions, and oxygen, but the therapeutic effect was not high. Later, they responded to the Party's call and implemented integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment, saving many critically ill children. They tasted the sweetness in the process of treating pneumonia with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and further strengthened their determination to study traditional Chinese medicine. Soon, they used integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine to treat many children suffering from persistent dysentery, reducing the mortality rate from 4% to 0.2%. Shi Xiuzhu said based on her own experience that learning and inheriting the clinical experience of veteran traditional Chinese medicine practitioners is an important way to inherit and develop the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to truly learn the good experiences of veteran traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, it is necessary to break the foreign framework, maintain good relations with veteran traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, learn humbly, and study diligently. After several years of efforts, Shi Xiuzhu has already summarized a set of experiences in treating viral pneumonia with traditional Chinese medicine under the guidance of her teacher, the famous traditional Chinese medicine expert Pu Fuzhou.
    Li Weifan was a student in the second training class for Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine after leaving their posts in Beijing. In the process of studying, he experienced two stages of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, from being skeptical to resolutely supporting it. He said that in the past, he doubted whether there really was a "treasure" in traditional Chinese medicine. After a period of study, he deeply felt that traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a great treasure trove. He cited many facts at the meeting, such as the achievements in treating fractures with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine, treating pharyngeal diphtheria with traditional Chinese medicine, and treating acute abdominal pain with acupuncture, which confirmed this view. He said that vitiligo is a common skin disease, and Western medicine has not yet found a good treatment method, but the acupuncture department of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine has treated more than 20 patients, all of whom have shown significant effects. Li Weifan said that the key to developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is for Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine. He expressed that he must listen to Chairman Mao's words, work hard to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and contribute to inheriting and developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Since 1958, more than 2,000 medical personnel in Beijing have studied traditional Chinese medicine on the job or after leaving their posts. With the development of medical and health undertakings and the need for health work to face the countryside, the number of Western medicine practitioners studying traditional Chinese medicine is constantly increasing.

    打开祖国医学宝库为我国和世界人民服务
    西医必须坚持学习中医
    北京三百多名西医座谈继承和发扬祖国医药学遗产问题
    新华社六日讯　北京市医学界最近举行座谈会，座谈如何继承和发扬祖国医药学遗产的问题。三百多名主治医师以上的西医和医院院长参加了座谈会，他们一致认为，祖国医药学包含着中国人民同疾病作斗争的丰富经验和理论知识，是一个伟大的宝库。医药工作者要更好地为工农兵服务，对我国和世界的医药卫生事业作出贡献，必须遵循毛主席的指示和党的中医政策，认真地学习中医，并且运用自己的科学知识，同中医密切合作，共同做好对祖国医药学遗产的研究、整理工作。
    北京市儿童医院传染科副主任史秀珠和中苏友谊医院外科副主任李维藩，在会上分别报告了他们在职和离职学习中医的体会。他们以自己的实践经验说明，西医学习中医，取长补短，根据需要运用中西医两种治疗方法，可以大大提高医疗效果。
    从事西医工作十多年的史秀珠，在职坚持学中医已经十年。她开始学习中医时，怕学了中医忘了西医，成了“三不象”。但实践结果证明，她的业务水平不仅没有降低，而且学到了更多的本领。一九五八年到一九六二年间，北京曾经流行过病毒性肺炎，严重威胁着儿童的健康。开始，史秀珠和她的同行们只用西医诊治的方法来抢救，除了使用抗菌素，就是输液给氧，疗效不高。后来，他们响应党的号召，实行中西医结合治疗，挽救了许多垂危病童。他们在中西医结合治疗肺炎的过程中尝到了甜头，更加坚定了学习中医的决心。不久，他们又用中西医结合的方法治疗了不少患迁延性痢疾的病儿，使死亡率由百分之四降到百分之零点二。史秀珠根据自己的体会说，学习和继承老中医的临床经验是继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的一个重要途径。而要真正把老中医的好经验学到手，必须打破洋框框，同老中医搞好关系，虚心学习，刻苦钻研。经过几年的努力，史秀珠已经在她的老师——著名中医专家蒲辅周的指导下，总结出一套中医治疗病毒性肺炎的经验。
    李维藩是北京市西医离职学中医第二期训练班的学员。他在学习的过程中，经历了对党的中医政策从半信半疑到坚决拥护两个阶段。他说，过去对祖国医学是否真有“宝”存在过怀疑，经过了一个时期的学习，才深深感到祖国医学确实是一个伟大的宝库。他在会上列举了很多事实，如中西医结合治疗骨折、中药治疗咽白喉、针灸治疗急腹症等方面的成就，证实了这个看法。他说，白癜风是一种常见的皮肤病，目前西医还没有找到很好的治疗办法，可是北京中医医院针灸科已治疗了二十多例病人，都有显著疗效。李维藩说，开发祖国医药学遗产这个宝库的关键是西医学习中医。他表示一定要听毛主席的话，努力学好中医，为继承和发扬祖国医药学遗产作出贡献。
    一九五八年以来，北京市有两千多名医务人员在职或离职学习中医。随着医药事业的发展和卫生工作面向农村的需要，西医学习中医的人数正在不断增加。
