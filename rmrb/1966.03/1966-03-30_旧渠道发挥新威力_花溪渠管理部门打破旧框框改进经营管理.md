    Old Channels Unleash New Power
    — Huaxi Canal Management Department Breaks Old Frameworks and Improves Operations and Management

    In southwestern Sichuan, on the right bank of the Qingyi River, lies an old canal built more than twenty years ago – the Huaxi Canal. After liberation, this old canal underwent all kinds of new changes, and thus became famous.

    The Huaxi Canal was built in 1943. Before liberation, the reactionary rulers used it as a tool for getting rich, causing it to be riddled with holes and in a state of disrepair, capable of irrigating only 20,000 mu of farmland at most. After liberation, the Huaxi Canal returned to the hands of the people, and the changes became greater year by year. The diseases and problems with the engineering were eradicated, the irrigated area was expanded, water resources were comprehensively utilized, and agricultural production was continuously promoted. Now, the irrigated area of the Huaxi Canal itself has expanded to 30,000 mu, exceeding the original design standard; it also uses hydropower to generate electricity, using the electricity to extract water from other rivers to irrigate more than 18,000 mu of farmland, totaling more than 48,000 mu, more than double that before liberation. Agricultural production in the irrigated area has greatly developed. Grain production increased by 11% the year before last, and another 10% last year. The yield per unit area of the main crop, rice, is about 30% higher than that in the general areas of the county. Two hydropower stations have been built using the canal's water power, generating more than 300 kilowatts; more than 130 water-powered processing machines such as water mills, water grinders, and oil presses have been installed on the main and branch canals for processing agricultural and sideline products. Various economic trees are planted along both sides of the canal, and sideline production such as fish farming has been developed by using abandoned ditches and old canals. Water fees for farmland in the irrigated area have been reduced year by year, but accumulation has continued to increase, achieving more than enough for self-sufficiency in management expenses.
  Break Frameworks, Face Production
    How did the great changes of the Huaxi Canal come about?

    Water conservancy management work, according to general conventions, is nothing more than watching the canals and guarding the dams, repairing and patching, ensuring smooth water flow, and preventing major problems. However, the cadres and workers of the Huaxi Canal Management Department believe that this is the minimum requirement of management work. They broke this convention, faced production, and used creative labor to make water conservancy better serve agricultural production.

    The cadres and workers of the Huaxi Canal still firmly remember a sharp ideological struggle they once experienced. That was after the completion of the treatment of all diseased engineering, and the irrigated area reached the highest number in the past, everyone's thinking showed signs of being satisfied with the status quo. After discovering this, the county party committee promptly educated them, telling them that they could not be satisfied with the irrigation area of 20,000 mu of farmland, but should regard water conservancy management as a socialist construction undertaking, actively and proactively overcome difficulties, and strive for more irrigation and more production. In this way, two paths were placed before them: one was to watch the canals and guard the dams, follow the rules and regulations, this road was stable and easy; the other was to break the conventional rules, tap potential, and promote a large increase in agricultural production, this road had many difficulties, and would add a lot of trouble to oneself, but it was a great road for building socialism. At this time, it was the high tide of agricultural cooperation, and the broad masses of cadres and people asked to expand the irrigation area and achieve a large increase in agricultural production. Under the leadership of the party organization at higher levels, all cadres and workers studied Chairman Mao's "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and other articles, which improved their ideological understanding. They said: Handling affairs according to routine is playing a small individualistic calculation; fearing difficulties and trying to save trouble is actually making water conservancy serve the managers, not serving the development of production; only by breaking the rules, tapping potential, and expanding irrigation can we make a big calculation and truly serve socialism.
      Bearing the Overall Situation in Mind, Moving Forward Against Difficulties

    With the ideological problem solved, they were determined to move forward in the face of trouble and difficulties.

    The leading cadres and technicians of the Management Committee ran all over the gullies, slopes, ridges, and hills in the dam area, conducting on-the-spot surveys. They learned that there were more than 30 places in the entire irrigation area, such as ridges, slopes, hills, etc., that lacked water for irrigation. Nearly 10,000 mu of dry land could be converted to rice fields as long as the water conservancy problem was solved; there were also a large number of paddy fields, some of which could not be irrigated by gravity because the water conservancy facilities had not been completed, and some still had to store winter water. What great potential for increasing production there was!

    The potential was great, but the follow-up engineering was also great, and there were many difficulties. There were more than 100 various canals to be built, as well as culverts, aqueducts, and other projects, and some trunk canals had to be rebuilt. How to solve the problem of funding for such a large project? They raised the issue at the irrigation area representative meeting, and some people said: "If there is no money, we can ask the state for subsidies; if that doesn't work, we can still get a loan." Most of the representatives disagreed with reaching out to the state. After discussion, it was decided that the expansion and supporting engineering below the branch canals would be borne by each production team separately, according to the benefits received, and that the materials needed for canal structures would be purchased and supplied by the Management Committee. In this way, they relied closely on the masses, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, and after three consecutive winters and springs of hard work, they finally completed the task of building and expanding more than 170 large and small canals and more than 180 structures, making the entire irrigation area a relatively complete irrigation system, with more than 7,000 mu of dry land turned into paddy fields, and more than 4,000 mu of winter water fields changed to two-season fields.

    After the completion of the expansion and supporting projects, another question facing the cadres and workers of the Huaxi Canal was whether or not to use canal water to build power stations. The county leaders believed that this would not only solve the electricity problem in the city, but also use electricity to lift water and irrigate some of the farmland in the hilly areas. However, most of these farmlands were outside the irrigation area, and it was necessary to build hydropower stations, rebuild some canals, build new flood discharge canals, and install control gates. Considering that the benefited communes and teams in the electrically irrigated area had heavy tasks in building irrigation canals, the county leadership handed over the reconstruction and construction project of the Huaxi Canal power station to the irrigation area. In the beginning, some cadres were ideologically opposed to it, believing that the construction of the power station would not have much effect on the irrigation area and were unwilling to bear the burden. The leading comrades of the county party committee educated them and told them to have a sense of the overall situation and a communist spirit, saying to them: "Is doing revolution just for the benefit of one irrigation area? Can building socialism well be achieved with just one irrigation area increasing production?" This gave the cadres and workers of the Management Committee a profound education. They realized that, in order to truly manage the Huaxi Canal with a revolutionary spirit, they must proceed from the needs of the masses, and actively do everything that is beneficial to production and the masses. After raising their awareness, they cooperated with the party committees of various communes to carry out education on the overall situation among the masses in the irrigation area, mobilizing everyone to actively participate in the construction, and taking the lead in participating in labor, finally successfully completing the task of power station construction.
      Reasonable Water Use, Economical Water Use

    The purpose of water management is water use. If water is not used well, production will not increase, and the management personnel are also responsible. For many years, the cadres and workers of the Huaxi Canal have continuously grasped reasonable water use and economical water use, promoting increased agricultural production.

    To manage water use well, it is necessary to go deep into the grassroots. The Management Committee called on all cadres and workers to squat in production teams and participate in agricultural production labor. In the beginning, some cadres and workers had concerns, fearing that grasping water use would affect water management; fearing that squatting in the teams would lose face; and some people even thought it was asking for trouble.

    Indeed, this was a new task, lacking experience, especially scientific irrigation water use methods, which they themselves did not understand. Chen Dayin, director of the Management Committee, took the lead in moving his luggage to the Wuxing Team No. 1 of the Zhige Commune and settled down to experiment with advanced irrigation techniques and explore squatting experience. Chen Dayin had visited other places to see the new method of soaking rice fields, so he and the two comrades who went with him first did this experiment. Comparative results showed that the new method of soaking rice fields produced finer mud, flatter fields, and less water consumption, generally saving one-third and increasing yields by 12%. Immediately, the new method of soaking rice fields was promoted in the irrigation area. Through squatting, Chen Dayin also discovered that sandy fields were particularly prone to water seepage, so he thought that the method of distributing water according to the number of acres of each branch canal was inappropriate, with sandy fields not getting enough water and muddy fields wasting water. They changed the method of water distribution, appropriately allocating more water to some branch canals with more sandy fields, ensuring reasonable irrigation throughout the irrigation area.

    Although the Huaxi Canal management work has achieved great results, they are not satisfied. They saw that there are still many shortcomings in the work. There are still more than 9,000 mu of winter water fields in the irrigation area. How to improve the drainage and irrigation system, change one season to two seasons, and increase multiple cropping? The irrigation problem has not been solved for some high-lying farmland. Now, the cadres and workers of the entire irrigation area, together with the masses of the irrigation area, are busy in the fields digging canals, installing water turbine pumps, improving drainage and irrigation canal systems, and expanding the irrigated area, preparing to transform winter water fields and strive for greater production increases in the irrigation area.

    旧渠道发挥新威力
    ——花溪渠管理部门打破旧框框改进经营管理
    四川西南部青衣江右岸，有一条二十多年前修成的旧渠——花溪渠。这条旧渠在解放后发生了种种新的变化，因此出了名。
    花溪渠是一九四三年修成的。解放前，反动统治者拿它当成发财致富的工具，弄得千疮百孔，破烂不堪，最多时只能灌溉农田两万亩。解放后，花溪渠回到人民手中，变化一年比一年大。病害工程根治了，灌溉面积扩大了，水利得到综合利用，促进了农业不断增产。现在，花溪渠本渠的灌溉面积，已扩大到三万亩，超过了原来的设计标准；还利用水力发电，以电力提取其他江河的水灌溉农田一万八千多亩，共计灌溉四万八千多亩，比解放前增加一倍以上。灌区的农业生产有了很大发展，前年粮食增产百分之十一，去年又增产百分之十，主要作物水稻的单位面积产量比全县一般地区高出百分之三十左右。利用渠道水力建成两座水电站，发电三百多瓩；还在干支渠上安装了水碾、水磨、油榨等水力加工机具一百三十多部，进行农副产品加工。沿渠两岸栽种各种经济林木，利用废沟旧渠发展了养鱼等副业生产。灌区农田水费逐年降低，积累却不断增加，做到了管理经费自给有余。
  打破框框  面向生产
    花溪渠的巨变是怎样来的呢？
    水利管理工作，按照一般常规，不过是看渠守坝，修修补补，保证流水畅通，不出大毛病而已。但是，花溪渠管理部门的干部职工认为，这是管理工作的最低要求。他们打破了这个常规，面向生产，用创造性的劳动，让水利更好地为农业生产服务。
    花溪渠的干部职工，至今还牢记着曾经经历过的一场尖锐的思想斗争。那是全部病害工程治理结束之后，灌溉面积达到了过去的最高数字，大家思想上露出了满足于现状的苗头。县委发现后，便及时教育他们，不能满足于两万亩农田的灌溉面积，要把水利管理看成是社会主义建设事业，积极主动，克服困难，争取多灌田，多增产。这样，摆在他们面前的道路有两条：一条是看渠守坝，按部就班，这条路稳当易行；一条是打破常规，大挖潜力，促进农业大增产，走这条路困难很多，而且会给自己增加许多麻烦，但这却是一条建设社会主义的大道。这时候，正是农业合作化高潮，广大干部和群众纷纷要求扩大灌溉面积，实现农业大增产。全体干部和职工在上级党组织的领导下，学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》《愚公移山》等文章，提高了思想认识。他们说：按常规办事，是打个人主义的小算盘；怕困难，图省事，实际上是让水利为管理人员服务，不是为发展生产服务；只有打破常规，挖掘潜力，扩大灌溉，才是打大算盘，真正为社会主义服务。
      胸怀全局  逆难前进
    思想问题解决了，他们便决心迎着麻烦、顶着困难前进。
    管委会的领导干部和技术人员，跑遍了坝上的每条沟、每坡地和每弯田，进行实地勘察。他们了解到，全灌区还有三十多处坎、坡、岗、丘等，缺水灌溉，近万亩旱地只要解决了水利问题，便可以改种水稻；还有大量水田，有的由于还没有完成水利配套而不能自流灌溉，有的还要蓄冬水。还有多么大的增产潜力啊！
    潜力大，继续配套的工程也大，困难也多。光是各种渠道就要修一百多条，还要修涵洞、渡槽等工程，改修部分干渠。这样大的工程，资金怎样解决呢？他们把问题提到灌区代表会议上讨论，有人说：“没有钱，可以向国家要补助；再不行，还可以贷款。”大多数代表不同意向国家伸手。经过讨论，决定把支渠以下的扩建配套工程，按照受益情况，由各生产队分别负担，包干负责；渠道建筑物所需器材，则由管委会负责购置供给。就这样，他们紧紧依靠群众，发扬自力更生的革命精神，经过连续三个冬春的艰苦奋斗，终于完成了新修和扩修大小渠道一百七十多条、建筑物一百八十多处的任务，使全灌区形成一个比较完整的灌溉系统，有七千多亩旱地变成水田，有四千多亩冬水田改为两季田。
    扩建配套工程完成以后，摆在花溪渠干部和职工面前的另一个问题，是要不要利用渠水建设电站。县领导干部认为，这样作，不但能够解决城关用电问题，而且可以用电力提水，灌溉一部分丘陵地区的农田。但是，这些农田绝大部分在灌区之外，而且要建设水电站，又要改建部分渠道，新修排洪渠，安装节制闸。县领导上考虑到，电灌区受益社、队要兴修灌溉渠道，任务重，便把花溪渠电站的改道兴修工程交给灌区负责进行。开始，有的干部思想不通，认为修电站对本灌区作用不大，不愿负担。县委领导同志教育他们，要有全局观点，要有共产主义风格，对他们说：“干革命，难道光为了一个灌区的利益吗？只一个灌区增产，能建设好社会主义吗？”这使管委会的干部和职工受到深刻的教育，他们认识到，要真正做到以革命精神来管好花溪渠，就一定要从群众的需要出发，凡是对生产对群众有利的事，都应当积极去办。他们在提高认识之后，在各公社党委配合下，向灌区群众进行了全局观点教育，动员大家积极参加修建，并且带头参加劳动，终于顺利地完成了电站建设任务。
      合理用水  节约用水
    管水的目的是用水，水没有用好，增不了产，管理人员也有责任。许多年来，花溪渠的干部和工人不断抓了合理用水和节约用水，促进了农业增产。
    要管好用水工作，就必须深入基层。管委会号召所有干部和工人到生产队蹲点，参加农业生产劳动。开始，有的干部和工人有顾虑，怕抓了用水，影响管水；怕蹲了点，会丢掉面；还有人认为这是自找麻烦。
    的确，这是一项新的工作，缺乏经验，尤其科学的灌溉用水方法，他们自己也不懂。管委会主任陈大银，首先带头把行李搬到止戈公社五星一队，住下来试验先进的灌溉技术，摸索蹲点经验。陈大银到外地参观过新法泡田技术，他便和同去的两个同志首先做这项试验。对比结果，新法泡田翻犁的泥细、田平、用水少，一般能节省三分之一，产量高百分之十二。这一下，新法泡田便在灌区内推广开了。通过蹲点，陈大银还发现沙田特别容易渗水，于是想到各条支渠按照田亩多少分配水量的办法不妥当，沙田多的地区水量不够，泥田多的地区又造成用水浪费。他们便改变了分水办法，对灌溉沙田多的一些支渠，适当多分配一些水，保证了全灌区合理灌溉。
    花溪渠管理工作虽然获得了很大的成绩，但是他们并没有满足。他们看到了工作中还有许多不足之处。灌区内还有九千多亩冬水田，如何改善排灌系统，改一季为两季，增加复种。有部分地势高的农田，灌溉问题还没有解决。现在，全灌区的干部和职工正和灌区群众一起，在田野上忙着开挖渠道、安装水轮泵，改善排灌渠系，扩大灌溉面积，为改造冬水田，争取灌区更大增产作准备。
