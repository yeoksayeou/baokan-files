    Mai Xiande, who displayed an overwhelming heroic spirit against the enemy on the battlefield amidst the storm of gunfire, shows himself worthy of being a good soldier of Chairman Mao in the face of honor!
    On the afternoon of February 4th this year, the Guangzhou Military Region held a learning conference with over four thousand representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as militia, to learn from Mai Xiande. That morning, a naval comrade at the hospital asked Mai Xiande, "What will you say regarding today's conference!" Mai Xiande said, "Learn from everyone, improve every day, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." The comrade suggested, "Would you write it down and send it to the conference?" Mai Xiande agreed and wrote with his left hand, "Be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Head Nurse Li Jin'ai, who was watching nearby, suggested adding the word "forever" above that, and Mai Xiande immediately added it. After his afternoon nap, Li Jin'ai saw that the words, written in two separate sessions, were a bit crooked and asked Mai Xiande to write it again in the same way, writing it better. Mai Xiande looked at the words "Forever be a good soldier of Chairman Mao" for a moment, then wrote, "Strive to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." "Forever" was changed to "Strive," how modest these two words are.
    When the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to award Mai Xiande the "Model Communist Youth League Member" certificate, Head Nurse Li Jin'ai excitedly told him the news, and Mai Xiande was very happy to hear it. Li Jin'ai asked him, "What attitude should you have yourself?" Mai Xiande said, "Guard against arrogance and rashness, and be a Communist Party member."
    He is like this in the face of honor, and in his daily life in the hospital, he is even more unwilling to show off. Whenever the hospital broadcasts news of Mai Xiande's deeds and learning activities over the radio, the nurse accompanying him on his walks reminds him:
  "Mai Xiande, listen, everyone is learning from you!" Mai Xiande always shakes his head and says, "No, no."
    The medical staff in the hospital often pass on stories of how the hero Mai Xiande maintains the true qualities of an ordinary soldier in the face of honor. That day, the Guangzhou Military Region held a learning conference with Mai Xiande, and superiors sent a car to pick up Mai Xiande to meet all the attendees of the conference. He walked out of the ward, and the car was already parked at the door. Head Nurse Li Jin'ai helped him into the car, but he shook his hand and said, "No, no!" and went straight outside. Soldiers in the army walk to the conference, and this time Mai Xiande also wanted to walk to the venue like in the army. Comrades explained to him: It would take more than two hours to walk to the venue, and the meeting would be over by the time you got there. Only then did they persuade Mai Xiande to get into the car.
    In order to strive for the early recovery of limb and language functions, Mai Xiande, who was hemiplegic and lying in bed when he first entered the hospital, endured the pain and tried his best to get up, but he fell back down as soon as he sat up. No, the more difficult it is, the more you must go on! He begged the nurse to give him a belt, tied to one end of the bed, stretched out his left hand to pull the belt tightly, and struggled to pull his upper body up.
    In the physical therapy room, Mai Xiande persisted in exercising his limbs under the guidance of the nurse. He sat on the physical therapy equipment, spread his arms, and held the double "paddles" to practice "rowing." That not-so-strong right hand followed the left hand to exert force, and each stroke caused a burst of pain. The doctor next to him ran to help him, leading him to move his right hand. Before long, the stubborn Mai Xiande shook off the doctor's hand and shook it hard himself. Sweat streamed from his forehead, and the nurse advised him to rest for a while. "No, no!" Mai Xiande answered crisply and continued rowing. In order to restore the function of his right foot, he rode a "bicycle," tightened the pressure adjustment spring, and lifted his weak and powerless right foot to rotate sharply, often pedaling hundreds to thousands of times, pedaling until he was covered in sweat before stopping. According to the exercise plan, under the guidance of the doctor, he insisted on forty-five minutes of rowing, pedaling a bicycle, patting a ball, crossing obstacles, and fifteen other exercises every day. When the time was up, the doctor told him to rest, but he always said, "Come on!" and continued to do it. Later, the doctor had to order him to "Stop" before he stopped.
    It took Mai Xiande only twenty-two days from being unable to move in the ward to starting functional recovery. Now his right hand grip strength has gone from being unable to move to being able to grip eighteen kilograms, he can walk, and he can play badminton. The medical staff were moved by his tenacious will and perseverance.
    After entering the hospital, Mai Xiande insisted on reading Chairman Mao's works every day, just like in the army. He draws infinite strength from Chairman Mao's works, exercises his revolutionary will, and fights against illness. When he was lying in bed and unable to get out of bed, he studied Chairman Mao's works every morning, afternoon, and evening, asking the nurse to read to him, or the nurse read a sentence, and he read a sentence, studying for about an hour and a half every day. When he was able to get out of bed, he read and wrote. At this time, in order to exercise the activity function of his limbs, he was unwilling to stay quietly in the ward, so he put Chairman Mao's works in his pocket and ran around all day, learning wherever he went.
    Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, the hero Mai Xiande shines with radiant ideological qualities. On the battlefield of life and death, he is a victor. In the face of honor, in the struggle against pain, he is also a victor who can stand the test.

    一片丹心向阳开
    ——英雄麦贤得在医院
    在炮火纷飞的战场上表现出压倒一切敌人的英雄气概的麦贤得，在荣誉面前一样表现出不愧为毛主席的好战士！
    今年二月四日下午，广州部队陆海空三军及民兵代表四千多人举行向麦贤得学习大会。那天上午，在医院里的一位海军同志问麦贤得：“你对今天的大会将有什么表示！”麦贤得说：“向大家学习，天天向上，做毛主席的好战士。”那位同志提议说：“你把它写下来送给大会好吗？”麦贤得答应了，用左手写上：“做毛主席的好战士。”护士长李金爱在旁看着，便建议他在上面再加上“永远”两个字，麦贤得立刻加上了。他午睡后醒来，李金爱见这张分两次写的字有点歪斜，便请麦贤得照样再写一遍，写得更好一点。麦贤得望着“永远做毛主席的好战士”这几个字想了一会，然后写上：“努力做毛主席的好战士。”“永远”改成了“努力”，这两个字改得多么谦虚。
    当共青团中央决定给麦贤得以“模范共青团员”奖状的时候，护士长李金爱兴奋地把这个消息告诉他，麦贤得听了很高兴。李金爱问他：“你自己应该抱什么态度呢？”麦贤得说：“戒骄戒躁，做一个共产党员。”
    在荣誉面前是如此，在医院的日常生活中，他更是时时处处不愿意表现自己。每当医院转播电台播出麦贤得事迹和学习麦贤得活动的消息时，陪伴他散步的护士就提醒他说：
  “麦贤得，你听，大家都向你学习呢！”麦贤得总是摇摇头说：“不要，不要。”
    医院里的医护人员，常常传颂着英雄麦贤得在荣誉面前保持普通一兵本色的故事。那天，广州部队举行向麦贤得学习大会，上级派车来接麦贤得去和参加大会的全体人员见面。他走出病房，小汽车已停在门口。护士长李金爱扶他上车，他一边摇手一边说：“不要，不要！”直往外走。战士在部队参加大会都是步行着去的，这次麦贤得也要象在部队一样，走到会场。同志们向他解释：走到会场要两个多小时，等走到也就散会了。这样才说服麦贤得上了车。
    为了力争早日恢复肢体功能和语言功能，麦贤得初进医院时，半身瘫痪躺在床上，他却忍着痛，使尽劲儿要起来，可是刚坐起来又倒下去了。不行，越是困难，越是要上！他央求护士给他一根带子，系在床尾一端，伸出左手去拉紧布带，奋力把上半身拉起来。
    在体疗室里，麦贤得在护士指导下坚持不懈地锻炼肢体。他坐在体疗器械上，展开双臂，扶着双“桨”练习“划船”，那不太有力的右手跟着左手使劲地划，每划一下都引起一阵剧痛。在旁的医生跑来助他一臂之力，带他推动右手。不多久，倔强的麦贤得就甩开医生的手，自己使劲地摇了。汗水从他额上直淌，护士劝他休息一下。“不要，不要！”麦贤得答得很干脆，依旧划下去。为了恢复右脚的活动功能，他骑上“脚踏车”，拧紧压力调节弹簧，提起那软乏无力的右脚便急剧转动，往往蹬几百次到几千次，蹬得满身大汗才停止。他按照锻炼计划，在医生指导下，每天坚持四十五分钟的划船、蹬脚踏车、拍球、越障碍等十五项锻炼，时间到了，医生叫他休息，他总是说：“来吧！”便继续做下去。后来医生只好给他下令“停止”，他才停下来。
    麦贤得从在病房不能活动到开始功能恢复，仅仅用了二十二天时间。现在右手握力从不能活动到握十八公斤，能散步，能打羽毛球。医务人员都被他这种顽强的意志和毅力所感动。
    麦贤得进了医院，就象在部队一样，坚持着天天读毛主席著作。从毛主席著作中吸取无穷的力量，锻炼自己的革命意志，同疾病作斗争。当他躺在床上还未能下地走动的时候，每天上午、下午和晚上都学习毛主席著作，请护士念给他听，或者由护士读一句，他念一句，每天学习大约一个多钟头。当他能下地走动时，他就又读又写。这时他为了锻炼自己肢体的活动机能，不愿意安静地呆在病房里，就把毛主席著作放在口袋里，整天到处跑，走到哪里学到哪里。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，英雄麦贤得身上闪耀着熠熠发光的思想品质。在出生入死的战场上他是胜利者，在荣誉面前，在和伤痛作斗争中，他同样是个经得起考验的胜利者。
