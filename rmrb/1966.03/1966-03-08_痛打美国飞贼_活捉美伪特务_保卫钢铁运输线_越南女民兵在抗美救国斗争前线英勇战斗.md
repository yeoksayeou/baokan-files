    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 7th: Our reporter reports: The broad masses of female militia in North Vietnam have played a tremendous role in the Anti-American National Salvation Struggle.
    Currently, the total number of female militia in North Vietnam has more than doubled compared to a year ago. Female militia organizations have been established in every township, village, and most agencies and factories. The female militia bravely participate in combat and serve combat. In Hanoi, tens of thousands of women have joined the militia organizations. In various locations within the Third Military Region, hundreds of thousands of women are participating in various combat organizations such as aircraft hunting groups, combat duty groups, combat transport groups, and rescue groups. Female militia sharpshooters participating in combat duty and aircraft hunting groups have undergone excellent training and combat experience. They can closely coordinate with the powerful artillery fire of the People's Army's air defense forces to strike enemy aircraft. In Yen Chau District, Nghe An Province, in the past year, in addition to shooting down eight American aircraft with rifles and light machine guns alongside male militia, the female militia also cooperated with air defense forces to shoot down more than twenty enemy aircraft. The female militia of T Township in this district participated in the battle to defend a bridge on Highway 1. American bandit aircraft bombed this bridge more than thirty times, each time receiving severe punishment. Deng Thi Thanh, the female militia deputy platoon leader, is an outstanding machine gun shooter. The machine gun group she leads once shot down an American F-8U aircraft with its first volley of fire.
    The female militia also bravely capture American pilots who parachute to land. Luong Thi My, a female militia squad leader and a Dai ethnic girl from Yen Bai Province, discovered an American pilot attempting to parachute to escape during a battle. She immediately led her female militia squad, tracked and pursued him, and finally captured this American bandit.
    On the northern border and coastal defense lines of North Vietnam, a large number of female militia, along with male militia, vigilantly carry out the task of safeguarding the people's safety day and night, regardless of wind or rain. Ho Thi Dang, a female militia member of the Vinh Linh District guarding the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone at the 17th parallel, along with another female militia member, captured alive an armed American-puppet special agent who had just crossed over from the southern bank of the Ben Hai River on a dark and rainy night, and seized his pistol.
    Under the slogan of "Everything for the front lines, everything for victory," the heroic Vietnamese female militia are actively engaged in the struggle to defend the iron transportation line. The female militia of Nghe An Province, along with the people of the entire province, built more than 5,000 kilometers of roads in the past year. Many female militia have also learned the skill of dismantling time bombs, thwarting all the conspiracies and tricks of the American bandits attempting to sabotage the transportation lines of North Vietnam.

    Under the slogan of "Be ready at all times to strike the invading American aerial bandits," the broad masses of militia in North Vietnam are enthusiastically carrying out military training competitions to improve their air combat skills.

    痛打美国飞贼　活捉美伪特务　保卫钢铁运输线
    越南女民兵在抗美救国斗争前线英勇战斗
    据新华社河内七日电　本社记者报道：越南北方广大女民兵，在抗美救国斗争中，发挥了巨大作用。
    目前，越南北方的女民兵总人数比一年前增加了一倍以上。每个乡、村和大多数机关、工厂，都已经建立起女民兵组织。女民兵们英勇地参加战斗和为战斗服务。在河内市，已有成万名妇女参加了民兵组织。在第三军区各地，成十万妇女分别参加了猎机组、战斗值班组、战斗运输组和救护组等各种战斗组织。参加战斗值班和猎机组的女民兵射手，都经过良好的训练，并经过多次的战斗锻炼，能够同人民军防空部队的强大炮火密切配合，打击敌机。义安省演州县的女民兵，在过去一年中，除了同男民兵一起用步枪和轻机枪打落八架美国飞机外，还配合防空部队打落二十多架敌机。这个县T乡的女民兵们，参加了保卫第一号公路上的一座桥梁的战斗。美国强盗飞机向这座桥轰炸了三十多次，每次都受到了严厉的惩罚。女民兵副排长邓氏清是一位出色的机枪射手，她率领的机枪组，曾用第一排子弹击落美国F—8U型飞机一架。
    女民兵们还勇敢地捕捉跳伞着陆的美国飞行员。安沛省的一个女民兵班长、岱族姑娘梁氏美，在一次战斗中发现一个美国飞行员企图跳伞逃命，她便立即率领着她的女民兵班，跟踪追捕，终于把这个美国强盗俘获了。
    在越南北方边防、海防线上，也有广大的女民兵和男民兵一起，不分昼夜，不避风雨，警惕地执行着保卫人民安全的任务。守卫在十七度线非军事区北缘的永灵区女民兵胡氏当，同另一位女民兵一起，在一个漆黑的雨夜里，活捉住一个刚从边海河南岸偷渡过来的美伪武装特务，并缴获了他的一支手枪。
    英雄的越南女民兵，在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号下，积极投入保卫钢铁运输线的斗争。义安省的女民兵同全省人民一起，在过去一年中共修筑了五千多公里长的公路。还有许多女民兵已学会了拆卸定时炸弹的本领，使美国强盗妄图破坏越南北方运输线的一切阴谋诡计遭到了失败。（附图片）
    在“随时准备打击来犯的美国空中强盗”的口号下，越南北方广大民兵热烈开展练兵竞赛，提高对空作战技术。图为广平省的两好（战斗好、生产好）战士、大烽合作社的民兵负责人范氏常在练习射击。
