    South Vietnam National Liberation Front Foreign Liaison Committee Condemns U.S. Imperialism for Increasing Troops in South Vietnam
    South Vietnamese Military and Civilians Resolutely Thwart U.S. Imperialist Plot to Expand the War
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11 (via dispatch) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 8th, strongly protesting the U.S. government’s recent decision to send another 20,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam to expand the war of aggression. The statement emphasized that no matter what brutal military actions and malicious political means U.S. imperialism adopts, it will not be able to force the South Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and accept its overbearing conditions.
    The statement pointed out that the U.S. decision to send another 20,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam is an adventurous action that will further worsen the situation in Indochina, increase the crisis of expanding the war of aggression to the entire Indochina, and seriously threaten peace and security in Southeast Asia and the world.
    The statement said that U.S. imperialism's attempt to reverse its current passive and desperate predicament in South Vietnam by increasing troops is nothing but a fantasy. The more troops it sends, the greater the casualties and the more disastrous the defeat will be. The glorious achievement of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in annihilating 16,000 U.S. aggressors and thousands of their puppet troops in the first two months of this year is a powerful warning to them.
    The statement said that the U.S. action of increasing troops to South Vietnam and driving its puppets to send more mercenary troops completely exposed the deceptive nature of the Honolulu Conference and tore off the mask of U.S. President Johnson's so-called "peace" offensive.
    The statement called on the people of South Vietnam to recognize their historical mission, never succumb to force, and not be confused by the false peace rhetoric of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The statement said that the only way to achieve true independence, democracy, and peace is to persevere in the war of resistance to the end, save themselves, and fulfill the national liberation cause and the international obligations to the cause of world peace and democracy.
    The statement called on the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces to fear no difficulties and hardships, carry forward the tradition of heroism and self-reliance, resolutely forge ahead, strike the enemy fiercely and accurately, annihilate more U.S. bandits and their running dogs, completely thwart the U.S. imperialist ambition of aggression, crush the puppet regime that betrays national interests and the puppet military apparatus that serves as cannon fodder for the United States, so as to realize the people's legitimate aspirations and enable South Vietnam to achieve independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and then unify the motherland.
    The statement also called on the people of all countries in the world to promptly condemn and take concrete measures to stop the new acts of aggression by the U.S. government and to vigorously and effectively support the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    南越民族解放阵线对外联络委员会谴责美帝增兵南越
    南越军民坚决挫败美帝扩大战争阴谋
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会八日发表声明，强烈抗议美国政府最近决定再向越南南方增派两万名美军扩大侵略战争的行动。声明强调指出，不管美帝国主义采取怎样残暴的军事行动和恶毒的政治手段，也无法迫使越南南方人民放下武器，接受它的蛮横的条件。
    声明指出，美国决定再向越南南方增派两万名美军的冒险行动，将进一步恶化印度支那地区的局势，增加了把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的危机，严重地威胁着东南亚和世界的和平与安全。
    声明说，美帝国主义妄想通过增兵，来扭转它目前在越南南方所处的被动和绝望的困境，只不过是一种幻想。它增兵越多，伤亡就越大、失败得也就更加惨重。越南南方军民今年头两个月歼灭美国侵略军一万六千名及其仆从军数千名的辉煌战绩，就是对它们的有力警告。
    声明说，美国向越南南方增兵和驱使它的仆从增派帮凶军的行动，完全暴露了檀香山会议的欺骗性，撕下了美国总统约翰逊的所谓
  “和平”攻势的假面具。
    声明号召越南南方人民认清自己的历史使命，决不在武力面前屈服，不被美帝国主义及其走狗的虚假的和平论调所迷惑。声明说，争取真正的独立、民主和和平的唯一道路，是把抗战路线坚持到底，以自己拯救自己，完成民族解放事业和对世界和平、民主事业所负的国际义务。
    声明号召越南南方解放武装力量不怕一切艰难困苦，发扬英勇不屈和自力更生的传统，坚决勇往直前，又狠又准地打击敌人，歼灭更多的美国强盗及其走狗，彻底挫败美帝国主义的侵略野心，粉碎出卖民族利益的伪政权和为美国充当炮灰的伪军机构，以实现人民的正当愿望，使越南南方获得独立、民主、和平和中立，进而统一祖国。
    声明还呼吁世界各国人民及时谴责和采取具体措施，以制止美国政府的新的侵略行动，大力和切实地支援越南人民的斗争。
