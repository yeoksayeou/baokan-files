    Do a Good Job in Sanitation, Protect Health, Guarantee Production
    Patriotic Health Movement Committee and Ministry of Health Issue Notice to Launch Spring Sanitation Campaign
    Shanghai Mobilizes the Masses to Prevent and Control Major Spring Diseases and Do a Good Job in Urban and Rural Sanitation
    Editor's Note: Doing a good job in sanitation and preventing various diseases is a major event related to the lives and production of the masses. Especially in the spring, when the weather is unpredictable and people are prone to illness, carrying out the patriotic health movement to prevent and control the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases should attract the attention of all localities.
    The cause of the masses must be handled by the masses themselves. To do a good job in sanitation, the key lies in inspiring the masses' awareness, imparting policies, knowledge, and methods to the masses, and truly mobilizing the masses to take action. If the masses are not mobilized, and only a few people are busy with this and that, it will be impossible to achieve the expected goals.
    Now, the Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee and the Ministry of Health have issued a notice to launch a spring patriotic health movement. Health departments at all levels and urban and rural medical workers should immediately take action, go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, and deep into production, and work together with the broad masses to make every effort to do a good job in spring sanitation, so as to achieve the goals of preventing diseases, protecting health, and guaranteeing production.
    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch – The Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee and the Ministry of Health recently issued a notice requiring all localities to actively carry out the spring patriotic health movement to prevent infectious diseases.
    The notice said that at present, it is the season when winter and spring alternate, and the weather is unevenly cold and hot. Respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza and measles are extremely easy to spread and become prevalent. In order to better protect the people's health, protect the labor force, and promote a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production, patriotic health movement committees and health departments at all levels must immediately take action, conscientiously mobilize the masses, and actively carry out the spring patriotic health movement to prevent and control the epidemic of infectious diseases.
    The notice pointed out that various respiratory infectious diseases can be prevented and treated. As long as the principle of prevention first is implemented, the masses are mobilized, and prevention and disease investigation are strengthened, so that diseases are prevented when there are no diseases, and early detection, immediate isolation and treatment are carried out when there are diseases, the spread can be controlled. The notice requires health departments at all levels and rural mobile medical teams and health work teams to go deep into rural areas, factories, mines, and construction sites, and work together with the broad grassroots medical and health personnel to combine disease investigation and treatment with health propaganda, and impart the knowledge and methods of preventing and treating the current major diseases to the masses. Patriotic health movement committees at all levels should combine production and fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction, taking the prevention and treatment of the current major diseases as the content, and use various forms of publicity such as broadcasting and blackboards to quickly organize and mobilize the masses, set off a mass sanitation blitz, and mobilize the masses to consciously do a good job in environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, enhance physical fitness, and prevent diseases.
    The notice requires all localities to organize relevant units to grasp key measures such as opening windows for ventilation, drying and washing bedding, cleaning indoor and outdoor environments, and strengthening the hygiene management of public places and the catering industry, according to the characteristics of respiratory infectious diseases. In areas where diseases occur or are prevalent, measures must be taken to combine mass reporting of diseases, health worker disease investigation, and medical personnel diagnosis and treatment to carry out early isolation and treatment. Medicines and treatment methods should be adapted to local conditions and materials, and the role of various local remedies and methods should be brought into play.
    The notice requires rural areas in all localities to combine the spring patriotic health movement with basic rural health construction such as fecal management and drinking water improvement, as well as the elimination of the four pests, and constantly change the rural health outlook.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st dispatch – The Shanghai Patriotic Health Advanced Units and Advanced Workers Representative Meeting recently held called on the people of the city to launch a spring patriotic health movement centered on the prevention and treatment of major spring diseases. In rural areas, this year, the focus should be on preventing and treating schistosomiasis, and focusing on drinking water hygiene, fecal management, and eliminating snails; in urban areas and market towns, the focus should be on eliminating mosquitoes and flies and doing a good job in food hygiene.
    In 1965, Shanghai achieved remarkable results in urban and rural health work. Many urban medical personnel actively responded to the Party's call, participated in mobile medical teams and health work teams, went to the countryside to carry out disease prevention and treatment and health construction work, and promoted the development of the patriotic health movement in rural areas. A total of more than 20,000 wells were dug in the rural suburbs, more than four times the total number of wells dug in the past two years, and 34 county-administered towns had tap water, and the masses' drinking water conditions were initially improved; more than 14,000 production teams realized fecal management in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation; the snail eradication area totaled 90.32 million square meters, and more than 90,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated. After rectification and training, the rural grassroots health worker team has developed and improved in both quantity and quality.
    In the activity of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other, Shanghai has emerged with many new patriotic health advanced units and individuals. In 1965, there were a total of 3,252 advanced units in the city, an increase of 678 over 1964; 3,623 advanced individuals, an increase of 832 over 1964; among the city's 26 health model units, 10 units emerged in 1965. The health model unit, the snail eradication team of the Pandian Third Production Brigade of the Zhuangxing People's Commune in Fengxian County, has 21 snail eradication members who do not leave production, most of whom are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. They conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", and were more enthusiastic. Regardless of wind, snow, or rain, they led the masses to carry out the snail eradication struggle. Now, most of the snails in this brigade have been eliminated. In Jing'an District, 115 neighborhood committees and more than 2,000 Red Cross health station branch heads and above have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's four works, "Concern for the Masses' Livelihood, Attention to Working Methods", "Serve the People", "In Memory of Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" over the past year, and a large number of good people and good deeds have emerged who care about public health, help others do sanitation, help others and cooperate with each other.

    作好卫生工作  保护健康  保证生产
    爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部通知开展春季卫生运动
    上海市动员群众防治春季主要疾病作好城乡卫生工作
    编者按：作好卫生工作，预防各种疾病，是有关群众生活和生产的一件大事。特别是在春季，乍暖还寒，容易生病；开展爱国卫生运动，预防和控制传染病的发生和流行，更应该引起各地的注意。
    群众自己的事业，必须依靠群众自己去办。要作好卫生工作，关键在于启发群众的自觉，把政策、知识、办法交给群众，真正把群众动员起来，大家动手动脚来做。如果不去发动群众，只是少数人忙这忙那，就不可能达到预期的目的。
    现在，中央爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部发出了开展春季爱国卫生运动的通知，各级卫生部门和城乡医务工作者，应该立即行动起来，深入基层，深入群众，深入生产，同广大群众一起，尽一切努力，把春季卫生工作做好，达到预防疾病、保护健康、保证生产的目的。
    新华社一日讯中央爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部最近发出通知，要求各地积极开展春季爱国卫生运动，预防传染病。
    通知说，目前正当冬春交替的季节，天气冷热不均，流感、麻疹等呼吸道传染病，极易传播、流行。为了更好地保护人民健康，保护劳动力，促进工农业生产新高潮，各级爱国卫生运动委员会、各级卫生部门，必须立即行动起来，认真发动群众，积极开展春季爱国卫生运动，预防和控制传染病的流行。
    通知指出，各种呼吸道传染病都是可以预防、治疗的。只要贯彻预防为主的方针，发动群众，加强预防和查病工作，做到无病防病，有病早期发现、即时隔离治疗，就可以控制蔓延。通知要求各级卫生部门和农村巡回医疗队、卫生工作队，深入农村、厂矿、工地，同广大基层医疗卫生人员一起，结合查病、治病，进行卫生宣传，把防治当前主要疾病的知识和办法交给群众。各级爱国卫生运动委员会要结合生产积肥和水利建设，以防治当前主要疾病为内容，利用广播、黑板报等各种宣传形式，迅速组织动员群众，掀起一个群众性的卫生突击活动，发动群众自觉地搞好环境卫生、个人卫生，增强体质，预防疾病。
    通知要求各地根据呼吸道传染病的特点，组织各有关单位抓好开窗通风、晒洗被服、清扫室内外环境、加强公共场所和饮食行业的卫生管理等关键性措施。在疾病发生或流行的地区，必须采取群众报病、卫生员查病、医务人员诊疗三结合的措施，早期进行隔离治疗。药品和治疗方法要因地制宜、就地取材，发挥各种土方土法的作用。
    通知要求各地农村把春季爱国卫生运动同粪便管理、饮水改良等农村卫生基本建设以及除四害等工作结合起来，不断改变农村卫生面貌。
    新华社上海一日电上海市最近举行的爱国卫生先进单位先进工作者代表会议，号召全市人民开展一个以防治春季主要疾病为中心的春季爱国卫生运动。在农村，今年要以防治血吸虫病，狠抓饮水卫生、粪便管理、消灭钉螺为重点；在市区和集镇以消灭蚊蝇、搞好饮食卫生为重点。
    一九六五年，上海市城乡卫生工作取得了显著成绩。许多城市医务人员积极响应党的号召，参加巡回医疗队和卫生工作队，到农村去进行防病治病和卫生建设工作，推动了农村的爱国卫生运动的开展。郊区农村共打井二万余口，超过以往两年打井总和的四倍，还有三十四个县属镇有了自来水，群众的饮水条件得到了初步改善；有一万四千多个生产队结合积肥实现了粪便管理；灭螺面积共九千零三十二万平方米，治疗血吸虫病病人九万余名。农村基层卫生员队伍经过整顿培训，数量和质量都有了发展和提高。
    在比学赶帮超活动中，上海市出现了许多新的爱国卫生先进单位和个人。一九六五年全市先进单位共三千二百五十二个，比一九六四年增加六百七十八个；先进个人三千六百二十三个，比一九六四年增加八百三十二个；全市二十六个卫生标兵单位中，有十个单位是一九六五年涌现出来的。卫生标兵单位、奉贤县庄行人民公社潘垫第三生产大队灭螺队二十一个不脱产灭螺员，绝大部分是贫农下中农的子弟。他们认真地学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章，干劲更足，不管风雪雨天，带动群众开展灭钉螺斗争，现在这个大队的钉螺绝大部分已被消灭。静安区一百十五个里委会，二千多个红十字卫生站分站长以上的卫生骨干，一年来坚持学习毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》等四篇著作后，出现了大量关心公共卫生，帮助别人搞卫生，助人为乐，相互协作的好人好事。
