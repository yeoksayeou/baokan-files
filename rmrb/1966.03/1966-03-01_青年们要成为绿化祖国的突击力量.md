    Young People Should Become a Shock Force in Greening the Motherland
    Youths in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan Provinces (Autonomous Region) Respond to the Call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Persisting in Afforestation for Ten Years, Achieving Remarkable Results
    Xinhua News Agency, February 28th – For the past ten years, over ten million young people in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan provinces (autonomous region) have participated in greening activities annually. These young people, along with adults, have persisted in afforestation for ten years, planting over 30 million mu of trees.
    Youth representatives from these five provinces (autonomous region) participated in the Youth Afforestation Conference convened by the Communist Youth League Central Committee in Yan'an on March 1, 1956. In its congratulatory telegram to the conference, the Party Central Committee called on the nation's youth to contribute their strength to greening the motherland. The youth in these five provinces (autonomous region) enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, filled with the lofty ambition to transform the landscape of the motherland, clothing many barren mountains, wastelands, and beaches in green. Because of the trees planted in many regions, wind and sand were effectively controlled, soil erosion was stopped, and agricultural production was promoted. Since 1962, Henan Province has had 4.8 million young people participating in afforestation each year. In Lin'ying County, due to extensive afforestation, forestry income accounts for 30 percent of the total income of the county. In the struggle for afforestation, the youth learned the ability to conquer nature and tempered the tenacious will to overcome difficulties. The Communist Youth League branch of the Qingliangshan Brigade in Anyang County, Henan, has trained more than 280 young technical talents in mountain management and afforestation over the past ten years, and many have become the backbone of production teams. In the past, some young people in mountainous areas complained, "Poor mountains and evil waters, with stones but no future." After persistent afforestation, the mountains changed, the waters changed, and the mental outlook of the people also changed. Now they say, "Rich mountains and beautiful waters, with great prospects."
    Over the past ten years, afforestation has become an important traditional activity for the Communist Youth League at all levels in the five provinces (autonomous region), and relatively rich experience has been accumulated:
    First, emphasizing politics and conducting political and ideological education for young people, so that they fully recognize the great significance of afforestation and their own responsibilities, is the fundamental guarantee for successfully carrying out afforestation activities. When youths in Jiebing Village, Hancheng County, Shaanxi, afforested, they first studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." When there were no tree seeds, they organized two seed-collecting teams, carrying dry rations, crossing the Yellow River, and traveling hundreds of miles to collect 130 jin of tree seeds. When there was no nursery, they studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again and found a solution. Everyone worked hard for more than ten days, digging away a small earth mountain and filling in a river beach to build a five-mu nursery. When there was a drought, they studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again, carrying water to fight the drought and saving more than ten mu of saplings. Now all the gullies, bends, and riverbanks in the village have been planted with trees, becoming a greening red banner in the province.
    Second, forestry has strong periodicity and must be sustained for a long time to be effective. It is an arduous task that must be accomplished through mass movements. The Communist Youth League organizations in many regions, according to a unified plan, mobilized all the people, led by the youth, to fight "annihilation battles" against barren mountains and wastelands within a certain period of time, or organized some shock activities using festivals, holidays, and Youth Afforestation Day. After afforestation, "three-way alliance" professional teams, mainly composed of young people, were established for management and protection. The youth in Yan'an County hold two mobilization rallies every year, followed by shock afforestation, which has become a tradition. Over the past ten years, they and the masses have afforested more than 120,000 mu and planted 570,000 scattered trees. Now, saplings around Yan'an have grown into forests, and the landscape has changed.
    Third, to do a good job in afforestation, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and proceed from reality, and to closely integrate revolutionary zeal with scientific attitude. Koukou in Dingxi County, Gansu, is the driest place. The youth and adult staff of the Koukou Forest Farm planted trees for two consecutive years starting in 1956, but they all died due to drought. But they were not discouraged. They conducted surveys of more than 20 standard plots, studied more than 30 root systems, and analyzed more than 100 soil samples, drawing on experience, and finally successfully created more than 6,800 mu of forest, greening five large mountains and more than 20 gullies.
    Fourth, mobilizing the youth to vigorously engage in seed collection and seedling cultivation with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is an important thing to do well in afforestation. The Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (autonomous region) have organized a large number of youth seed-collecting teams and seedling cultivation groups, and have established youth nurseries under the unified leadership of the Party branch. Many places have also launched the "Communist Youth League Branch Runs Nursery" activity. With saplings, it is easier to afforest.
    The Communist Youth League Central Committee believes that in the past ten years, our country's youth have made great contributions and created great achievements in the struggle to green the motherland. However, it is still far from the requirements for greening the motherland, and the task is still very arduous. It is necessary to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish the idea of afforestation for the revolution, planting trees for the people, and creating benefits for future generations, and persist in afforestation activities for a long time. Not only must it be built quickly, but it must also be built well; not only must it be planted a lot, but it must also be planted alive; not only must trees be planted, but seedlings must also be cultivated; not only must forests be built, but they must also be protected. Now that the afforestation season has arrived, the Communist Youth League Central Committee hopes that the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels and the vast number of young people will take immediate action, proceed from the actual situation in their localities, and actively carry out afforestation activities. Strive to accelerate the greening of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    青年们要成为绿化祖国的突击力量
    陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（区）青年响应党中央和毛主席号召，坚持造林十年，取得显著成绩
    新华社二十八日讯　陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（区）十年来每年都有上千万青年参加绿化活动。这些青年同成老年人一起坚持造林十年，已经植树造林达三千多万亩。
    这五个省（区）的青年代表，曾在一九五六年三月一日参加了共青团中央在延安召开的青年造林大会。党中央在给大会的贺电中，号召全国青年为绿化祖国贡献出自己的力量。这五个省（区）的青年热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，他们满怀着改变祖国河山的豪情壮志，给许多荒山荒地荒滩披上了绿装。许多地区因为栽了树，有效地治服了风沙，制止了水土流失，促进了农业生产。河南省一九六二年以来，每年有四百八十万青年造林，临颍县由于大量造林，全县林业收入占总收入的百分之三十。青年们在造林斗争中，学到了征服自然的本领，锻炼了克服困难的顽强意志。河南安阳县清凉山大队团支部，十年中培养了治山造林的青年技术人材二百八十多人，许多人成为生产队的骨干。从前，有些山区青年抱怨说：“穷山恶水，有石头，没前途。”经过持久的植树造林，山变了，水变了，人的精神面貌也变了，现在他们说“富山秀水，大有奔头”。
    十年来，植树造林已成为五省（区）各级共青团的一项重要的传统活动，并且积累了比较丰富的经验：
    一，突出政治，对青少年进行政治思想教育，使他们充分认识植树造林的重大意义和自己的责任，是成功地开展造林活动的根本保证。陕西韩城县解冰村青年造林时先学《愚公移山》，没有树种，他们组织了两个采种队，带着干粮，渡过黄河，到几百里外的地方采回了一百三十斤树种。没有苗圃地，他们再学《愚公移山》，又找到了办法，大家突击十多天，挖掉了一座小土山，填平了一个河滩，修了五亩苗圃地，遇到干旱，他们再学《愚公移山》，挑水抗旱救活了十多亩树苗。现在全村所有的沟沟洼洼，路弯河旁都种上了树，成了全省的绿化红旗。
    二，林业的周期性强，必须长期坚持造林才能见效；它是一项艰巨的工作，必须大搞群众运动才能完成。许多地区的团组织按照统一的规划，在一定时间内，全民动手，青年带头，对一座座荒山，一块块荒地打“歼灭战”，或利用节日、假日、青年造林日，组织一些突击活动。造林之后，建立以青年为主的“三结合”专业队，进行管护。延安县青年每年开两次进军大会，会后突击造林，已成传统。十年来他们和群众一道造林十二万多亩，零星植树五十七万株，现在延安周围山上，幼苗已经成林，面貌已经变了。
    三，要搞好植树造林，还必须因地制宜，从实际出发，要把革命干劲和科学态度紧密地结合起来。甘肃定西县?口是个最旱的地方。?口林场的青年和成老年职工一道，从一九五六年起连造两年林，都旱死了。但是他们不灰心，搞了二十多个标准地的调查，挖了三十多个根系作研究，分析了一百多个土样，得出经验，终于成功地营造了六千八百多亩林，绿化了五座大山和二十多条沟壑。
    四，发动青年以自力更生的革命精神，大搞采种育苗，是搞好造林工作的一件重要的事情。五省（区）的团组织都组织了大量的青年采种队，育苗小组，在党支部统一领导下，建立青年苗圃。许多地方还开展了“团支部办苗圃”活动。有了树苗，林也就好造了。
    共青团中央认为，十年来我国青少年在绿化祖国的斗争中，作出了很大的贡献，创造了很大的成绩。但是，现在离绿化祖国的要求还很远，任务还十分艰巨。必须继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立为革命造林、为人民种树、为子孙后代造福的思想，长期坚持造林活动。不但要造得快，而且要造得好；不但要栽得多，而且要栽活；不但要植树，而且要育苗；不但要造林，而且要护林。现在造林季节已到，团中央希望各级团的组织和广大青年迅速行动起来，从本地实际情况出发，积极开展造林活动。为加速绿化祖国而斗争。（附图片）
