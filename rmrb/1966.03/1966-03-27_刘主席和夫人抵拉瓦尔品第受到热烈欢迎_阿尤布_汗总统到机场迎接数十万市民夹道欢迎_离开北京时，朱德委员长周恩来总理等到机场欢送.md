    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 26th.  Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and his wife, Wang Guangmei, arrived in Rawalpindi, the temporary capital of Pakistan, by special plane on the morning of the 26th for a friendly visit at the invitation of Pakistani President Ayub Khan.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife were given a grand and warm welcome by Pakistani President Mohammad Ayub Khan, government officials, and local people. Almost all of the city's 400,000 citizens and many people from nearby areas went to the streets to welcome the national leaders from the friendly neighboring country. Today, all schools, factories, and government agencies were closed, allowing people from all walks of life to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

    The special plane carrying Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage landed at Chaklala Airport in Rawalpindi at 10:00 a.m. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife stepped out of the cabin and onto the red carpet laid on the airport, President Ayub Khan was the first to step forward to greet them. Chairman Liu Shaoqi warmly shook hands with President Ayub Khan.

    Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and his wife Zhang Qian, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other members of the entourage also received a warm welcome.

    Four Pakistani girls presented flowers to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife.

After a 21-gun salute and the band played the national anthems of China and Pakistan, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by President Ayub, reviewed the Pakistani tri-service honor guard.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Chen Yi were introduced to the ministers of the Pakistani central government, members of the National Assembly, and prominent figures from all walks of life. Welcomers presented Chairman Liu Shaoqi with garlands made of gold and silver thread and gave him a white scarf embroidered with the Chinese characters: "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!" The dense crowds welcoming at the airport constantly shouted cheers of "Long Live and Friendship."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by President Ayub, drove out of the airport, followed by Vice Premier Chen Yi and other members of the entourage.

    Before Chairman Liu's special plane landed, Rawalpindi had a downpour. The welcomers, despite being soaked to the skin, waited in the rain for several hours to welcome the Chinese guests. Later, the weather slowly cleared up, and the sun shone on the smiling faces of the welcomers. As Chairman Liu and President Ayub drove to Rawalpindi, the dense crowds of welcomers standing along the three-kilometer-long road gave thunderous cheers. They enthusiastically ran forward to shake hands with the Chinese guests in the cars. Girls gathered together to sprinkle flower petals and perfume on the motorcade. The cars carrying Chairman Liu and President Ayub Khan were covered with flower petals.

    The dense crowds of welcomers on the streets and the thousands of people standing on balconies, trees, and rooftops cheered enthusiastically, and Chairman Liu waved to them in thanks.

    Among the welcomers were workers, female students in green and white uniforms, housewives in saris, gray-haired old men and women, and mothers holding babies. They waved the national flags of China and Pakistan, colorful ribbons, headscarves, and bouquets, and sprinkled colorful confetti. Groups of dancers and musicians performed rich and colorful ethnic programs in the welcoming procession. To the sound of loud slogans of "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship," they beat hand drums and played flutes. Some young students even shouted "Sino-Pakistani Friendship" and "Uncle Liu" in Chinese.

    Pakistani military personnel, wearing medals, some of whom wore medals recently awarded in the battle against Indian armed aggression, stood in rows on both sides of the street. As the motorcade passed, they presented arms in salute.

    Also present to welcome were Kashmiris in Rawalpindi. These Kashmiris in national costumes enthusiastically shouted: "Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi!"

    Today, the streets were decorated with the national flags of China and Pakistan. Red and green flags were hung on utility poles.
