    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 18th -- Representatives of various patriotic parties and organizations in Laos recently held a meeting in Khang Khay, Xieng Khouang Province, to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression.
    This meeting was held by the Lao Committee for the Struggle for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and a Unified State, the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, and other Lao patriotic parties and mass organizations for "Support Vietnam People's Week".
    A resolution passed by the conference pointed out that the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys is the center of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world and the people of Indochina today. The Lao people regard the victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle as their own victory.
    The resolution also stated that in order to completely smash all the American imperialist aggressive plots against Laos, and to thwart the American imperialists and their lackeys' rumors and slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Lao people must further strengthen the fighting fraternal solidarity with the Vietnamese people.
    The resolution said that the Lao people's independence can only be guaranteed when the people of other countries in Indochina achieve independence. Therefore, it is very necessary for the people of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia to strengthen their unity in the struggle against the common enemy—American imperialism.
    The conference also passed telegrams to the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    声援越南人民抗美救国斗争
    新华社康开十八日电　老挝各爱国党派和团体的代表最近在川圹省康开市举行集会，声援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    这次集会是老挝争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会、老挝爱国战线党、老挝爱国中立力量以及老挝其他各爱国党派和群众团体为“声援越南人民周”而举行的。
    大会通过的一项决议指出，越南人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争是当前世界人民和印度支那人民反帝斗争的中心。老挝人民把越南人民斗争的胜利，看作是自己斗争的胜利。
    决议还说，为了彻底粉碎美帝国主义对老挝的一切侵略阴谋，为了挫败美帝国主义及其走狗对越南民主共和国的造谣、诬蔑，老挝人民要进一步加强同越南人民的战斗的兄弟般的团结。
    决议说，只有当印度支那其他国家人民取得独立的时候，老挝人民取得独立才能得到保证。所以，对于老挝、越南、柬埔寨人民来说，在反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，加强团结是非常必要的。
    大会还通过了致越南祖国战线和越南南方民族解放阵线的电报。
