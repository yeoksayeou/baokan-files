    Plain Talk on Quality Assessment Methods
    Written by Yang Jike
    Editor's Note: How can mathematical science serve production and construction? How can mathematical theory be linked to practice? These are issues of concern to everyone, and also issues that mathematicians are currently striving to resolve. The article "Plain Talk on Unified Planning Methods" published in this newspaper on June 6th last year provided a good example of solving this type of problem. The article published today also embodies the efforts of mathematicians to serve production and link with practice. We believe that this effort is welcome and worthy of promotion.
        Clapper introduction:
    Factories across the country, machines roaring;
    Politics in command, production greatly soaring.
    Products accumulate daily, by the thousands and thousands;
    Want to check quality, how shall it be planned?
    If you want to measure all, time won’t allow at all;
    If you only pick one piece, you feel the representation weak.
    There's a great method to use, random sampling to choose,
    The samples selected, measure each one by one.
    Or have a look around, for flaws and defects profound,
    Estimate the whole from parts, mathematics imparts.
    Parts produced day and night, samples measured day and night,
    Before a few months pass, data amass.
    Summarizing production, requires papers by the ton,
    Numbers numerous as ants, a confused stance.
    Uneven and unaligned, this gives cause to mind,
    Thinking and thinking, a plan starts linking:
    Why not make a quality assessment chart, each data point a dot to impart,
    A few distinct dividing lines, highs and lows before your eyes.
    Which batch of products is substandard, on the chart, the dots are quite apparent;
    Quality rising or falling, clear as day by chart’s calling.
    Hang it in the workshop, for everyone to crop;
    Keep it as a card, for appraisal well-stored.
    Machine malfunctions appear, on the chart the signs are clear.
    Products sent out the door, users have assurance for.
    Data given to designers, with data for precise aligners; design hits perfection, function and efficiency find direction.
    Quality assessment chart, benefits never apart,
    Learning it isn't hard, drawing it's simple and broad.
    How is it to be done? Listen to what follows, everyone!
    How is Quality Measured?
    To assess quality, we must first make quality measurable, that is, to quantify quality. There are two main types of methods for measuring quality: one is metric data, and the other is count data.
    Quality indicators such as length, diameter, weight, lifespan, speed, smoothness, chemical composition, strength, etc., can generally be measured with scale instruments. The data obtained are called metric data. An average (called the -x data) can be calculated from a batch of metric data to measure where the center of gravity of the batch of data is. The range (called w data) can also be calculated by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number in the batch of data to measure their degree of dispersion.
    Not all qualities can be measured by instruments and scales. At this time, we can count the number of pieces with a certain attribute in a batch of products to measure quality. For example, the number of defective products, the number of substandard products, the number of damaged products, the number of soiled products, etc., can all be generated in this way. This type of data is called count data.
    There are two ways to represent this type of count data, which counts the number of pieces with a certain attribute in a batch of products. One is to directly write down the counted number (referred to as c data), and the other is to convert them into percentages (referred to as p data). For example, if it is found that 5 out of 50 pens are substandard after inspection, then the defective product count c = 5 (which is a c data); but it can also be converted into the defective product rate p = 5 ÷ 50 = 0.10 or 10% (which is a p data).
    For some products that are not counted piece by piece, count data cannot be converted into percentages. For example, inspecting rolls of cloth to see how many flaws there are, or inspecting liters of tap water to see how many bacteria there are. This is another type of count data, which can only appear in the form of c data.
    If people have the ability to manufacture products that are exactly the same, then the quantitative description of the quality of a batch of products would be very easy. Because any one piece or any part of the product can completely represent all the products, determining the quality of a part can tell us the quality of the whole. However, things cannot be so satisfactory. To this day, everyone has to accept the fact that only batches of parts with basically the same dimensions can be made, but it is impossible to make two parts with exactly the same dimensions. Even precise watch parts, when viewed under a microscope, still have different dimensions, but the differences are very small. The same is true for parts and other products. Steel mills cannot produce two furnaces of steel with absolutely the same carbon, silicon, manganese, and sulfur content, and flour mills cannot grind two bags of flour with exactly the same particle size distribution.
    Since there are differences in product quality, we cannot estimate the quality of the entire batch of parts based solely on the observation and inspection of one part or one sample. Everyone may naturally think: Wouldn't it be great to observe the quality of each product? This method of checking each piece is good, but it is too time-consuming. Modern factories only do this for products with low output but extremely high specifications, such as the inspection of aircraft engine parts. The vast majority of industrial products cannot do this. For example, if screws are produced, it would be too troublesome to measure them one by one in order to check the quality. The same is true for destructive testing. It is impossible to take all the produced coal for testing, nor can all the produced man-made fibers be subjected to tensile strength tests.
    Now the matter before us is very clear: For the vast majority of products, it is impossible to conduct a 100% inspection. Even if the same batch of products is subjected to several sampling inspections, the results of each inspection will inevitably have differences. If scientific measures are not taken to deal with this situation, not only will there be deviations in the quality assessment, making the assessment results unable to accurately reflect the objective situation, but it will also easily cause unnecessary contradictions between workers and inspectors, between the factory and the users, and between Party A and Party B, thereby affecting the improvement of quality and the development of production.
    The problem lies in finding a scientifically based quantitative method to assess quality. If everyone follows this method, there will be a common language for quality assessment. Not only will everyone have a better understanding of the objective situation of quality, but they can also basically reach a consensus.
    Is there such a method for assessing quality? Yes!
    The first step in learning this method is to learn how to draw a quality assessment chart.
    What is a Quality Assessment Chart?
    A quality assessment chart is drawn on rectangular coordinate paper with equally divided squares. According to the different types of quality data mentioned above, there are three most commonly used quality assessment charts: one is a quality assessment chart with a set of metric data for the average ? and range w data (referred to as the ? and w chart); one is a quality assessment chart with percentage p data of count data (referred to as the p chart); and one is a quality assessment chart with count data itself c data (referred to as the c chart). Figure 1 shows typical examples of these three charts. Their horizontal coordinates are the sequential sample group numbers; but the vertical coordinate of the ? chart is the average ?, the vertical coordinate of the w chart is the range w, the vertical coordinate of the p chart is the percentage p, and the vertical coordinate of the c chart is the count c. In these three charts, the ? chart and the w chart must be used together; the p chart and the c chart each have only one chart. In each chart, there are many uneven, up-and-down small dots, which represent the data calculated or counted from each sample group. A horizontal line runs through the middle of these small dots, drawn with a solid line, which is the average line of the data obtained under normal and stable operation conditions. There are two dashed lines above and below the average line. The two lines closer to each other are called the warning upper limit and the warning lower limit. The two lines farther away are called the action upper limit and the action lower limit. These four lines are collectively called the quality stability limits.
    As mentioned above, the quality data of batches of products must be uneven. But there are two different situations: one difference is accidental variation, which is often caused by many reasons, and either the reasons cannot be known, or even if they are known, it is impossible or not worthwhile to control them. The other difference is caused by variation for reasons, which sometimes have very simple reasons, generally no more than the machine malfunctioning, the operating method or technology having problems, or the raw materials changing; finding it and correcting it will smooth out the variation. If there is only accidental variation and no variation due to reasons, we say that the quality is stable. If there is variation due to reasons in addition to accidental variation, the quality is unstable.
    So how do you determine whether the quality is stable or not? This can be seen at a glance from the quality assessment chart. If the quality is stable, the dots on the chart will remain within the upper and lower limits. The chance (probability) of them going beyond the warning upper limit is not high. In a thousand dots, only about twenty-five will go beyond. The probability of going beyond the warning lower limit is also 25 per thousand; the probability of going beyond the action upper limit or action lower limit is even smaller. If the quality is stable, on average only one or two dots out of a thousand dots will go beyond the action upper limit or action lower limit.
    If the number of dots that exceed these upper and lower limits is greater than the number that should be there, the quality is judged to be unstable, and the root cause must be found. Figure 2 has three p charts illustrating three different situations (? , w, and c charts can be inferred similarly).
    The first chart shows that the defect rate on the p chart has significantly increased. The reason was found to be that a batch of new workers had just joined the work. After training to make their skills proficient, the quality returned to stability. This is a typical example of the effect of operational skills on quality expressed on the assessment chart.
    The second chart shows a section of dots on the p chart with a significantly increased defect rate. After investigation, it was found that the quality of the raw materials used during this period was problematic. After negotiations with the raw material supply unit, the quality of the raw materials returned to normal, and the dots on the p chart were pulled back. This is a typical example of the effect of raw materials on quality expressed on the assessment chart.
    The third chart shows that the quality originally appearing on the p chart was not good and was unstable. After research, it was found that the regulator on a certain machine was malfunctioning. Replacing it with a new one caused the later dots to obtain a new level of lower defect rate, and stability was also controlled. This is a typical example of the effect of equipment on quality expressed on the assessment chart.
    Someone asked, "In the statistical books of capitalist countries, this method is called the quality control method, and this chart is called the quality control chart. Can they control quality?" We say, "No!" How can mathematical methods control quality? Who has ever seen a doctor use a body temperature recording chart to control the condition of a patient? The body temperature chart only provides doctors with information about the patient's condition. Like a body temperature chart, an assessment chart can only provide management personnel with information on the stability and change of quality; to control quality, other methods must be relied upon. In order not to exaggerate the role of this method, we call it "quality assessment method" and "quality assessment chart."
    Someone may say: "The situation described in the above chart can be figured out without an assessment chart." That may be true, but past experience tells us that if a quality assessment chart is not used and one relies only on intuition, even if some situations can be discovered, sometimes they are discovered too late, delaying matters; or sometimes a single accidental variation in data is mistaken for a reason-based one; or sometimes important situations are overlooked. In short, the assessment chart can become a powerful tool for factory management personnel, just like a doctor with a thermometer. With a quality assessment chart, changes in quality can be discovered in a timely manner, and it can be distinguished whether they are accidental or reason-based. If more dots than expected are seen on the assessment chart exceeding the upper and lower stability limits, it is like turning on a red light to warn everyone: "There is a problem, hurry up and study it!"
    Of course, the assessment chart may not necessarily provide specific clues as to where the problem lies. In most cases, it must be found in the process itself. However, comparing several quality assessment charts together can help discover problems. Here are two typical examples.
    The first example involves three machines, operated by three people, with raw materials all coming from the same batch, and the product quality is unstable. From the three quality assessment charts, there are quite similar ups and downs between them. If the problem is with the machine or operation, how can there be such a coincidence? It was then judged that the reason for the unstable product quality lies in the instability of the raw material quality. When the raw materials are good, the product quality of each machine is good at the same time; when the raw materials are poor at another time, the product quality of each machine is poor at the same time (see Figure 3). Looking at these three charts, we feel that although the product quality fluctuates greatly and consistently, a closer look at the individual dots shows that the three have nothing in common. The reason for this is still the accidental variation introduced by random sampling. But it does not prevent the judgment that the raw materials are unstable.
    The second example is the nine assessment charts shown in Figure 4. These are the quality assessment charts of products made by three groups of workers in three shifts over three weeks. Originally, the intention was to compare the work quality of the three groups, but from these charts, it can be seen that the work quality of the three groups of workers is both good and bad, and they are comparable. There is no significant difference in quality between the various weeks, but the product quality of the day shift is significantly worse in the three shifts. After investigation, it was found that the lighting of the two night shifts was artificial lighting, which was more suitable in terms of angle and more suitable and uniform in terms of brightness than the daylight lighting of the day shift, thereby improving the quality of work. In response to this situation, the lighting of the day shift was improved to be like that of the night shift, and the quality immediately rose to the same level as the night shift.
    Another use is that when the dots on the assessment chart have a slow but directional transfer trend, it often shows up before human intuition has realized it. Please see the example in Figure 5 above. The strength of a certain steel material is gradually decreasing for some reason. This trend was already clearly shown on the chart as early as late March, and the number of dots below the warning lower limit has exceeded the allowed number. Using this chart, this situation can be discovered and corrected in a timely manner.
    When the person in charge of the factory weighs the gains and losses between quality and cost and wants to make a decision, the quality assessment chart is useful. Please compare the two -x charts in Figure 6 below. The chart on the left shows that the screws made with one process have very small dimensional variations and very good quality, too good! But the cost is very high; the chart on the right shows that the screws made with another process have larger dimensional variations and poorer quality, but the cost is very low, and it does not exceed the design specifications. (The relationship between the design limits and the stability limits in the assessment chart is omitted in this article.) Of course, the person in charge of the factory adopted the process on the right to produce the screws.
    Another use is in the evaluation of industrial products. If quality assessment charts of the same product of two brands are drawn, it can be seen at a glance which brand has better quality and which brand has worse quality. For those who do evaluation work, the quality assessment chart is tantamount to providing a unified standard.
    If it is the same batch of products and undergoes two sampling inspection procedures, for example, inspected once by the factory before leaving the factory, and then inspected by the user after leaving the factory, due to sampling reasons, the results of these two quality inspections are not exactly the same, but their fluctuation ranges must be similar. As long as the quality is stable, there is always a probability of about 25 per thousand of exceeding the warning upper or lower limit, and a probability of about 1 per thousand of exceeding the action upper or lower limit. In this way, there is a common language for quality inspection between the factory and the user, and the cooperative relationship between the two parties will be strengthened.
    Between workers and inspectors, having a quality assessment chart is equivalent to having a common language, and the relationship between them will inevitably become better.
    Quality assessment charts can be hung in the workshop or drawn on the blackboard for everyone to see. The dots representing quality can be added daily or weekly, which is both an objective and comprehensive assessment of the quality of work for the workers, and a kind of encouragement.
    Quality assessment charts can be drawn on cards and kept as files for permanent preservation. This type of card does not take up much space and is convenient to check. It is also the most time-saving to use it for investigation and statistics, and it can show the changes in the quality of various workshops and products, as well as the improvement in the technology of the operators.
    Most factories have received good reviews from technical operators after using quality assessment charts. The following are the results of a survey contained in one piece of data:
    Question: With a quality assessment chart, do you understand your own work better than before?
    Answer: More understanding (accounting for 81% of the total number of people). Answer: Not necessarily (accounting for 19%).
    Question: With a quality assessment chart, are you more responsible for your work than before?
    Answer: More responsible (accounting for 74% of the total number of people). Answer: Not necessarily (accounting for 26%).
    Question: With a quality assessment chart, can you better grasp the quality of your own work than before?
    Answer: Can better grasp (accounting for 87% of the total number of people). Answer: Not necessarily (accounting for 13%).
    Question: With a quality assessment chart, are your opinions more consistent with those of the quality inspectors than before?
    Answer: More consistent (accounting for 72% of the total number of people). Answer: Not necessarily (accounting for 28%).
    It seems that quality assessment charts can indeed play a certain role in industry. Understanding it and using it is always a beneficial thing.
    What has been introduced above is only the beginning of the quality assessment method. The drawing methods of various quality assessment charts, the sampling methods required for quality assessment, the connection between the quality assessment results and the design or standard specifications, etc., have not been discussed.
    The quality assessment method is an important branch of mathematical statistics methods. It is widely used in modern industry. It itself is also diversified with the specific requirements of various types of industries. What is introduced here are only a few of the most basic and simple quality assessment methods. We believe that once this method is handed over to the masses of workers, newer, more perfect, and more practical quality assessment methods will be developed to contribute to socialist construction.

    质量评估方法平话
    执笔人　杨纪珂
    编者按：数学科学怎样为生产建设服务，数学理论怎样联系实际，这是大家关心的问题，也是数学工作者当前所力求解决的问题。去年六月六日本报发表的《统筹方法平话》一文，提供了一个解决这方面问题的很好的例子。今天发表的这篇文章，也体现了数学工作者为生产服务和联系实际的一种努力。我们认为这种努力是值得欢迎、值得提倡的。
        快板引子全国各工厂，机器震天响；政治挂了帅，生产大增长。产品积一天，就有千千万。想要查质量，方法该怎样？若要统统量，限于时间无法办；倘只挑一件，又觉代表性不强。有个好办法，随机去抽样，抽到的样品，逐件量一量。或者看一看，瑕疵和缺陷，局部估总体，数学来帮忙。零件日夜产，样品日夜量，不消几个月，数据积成山。总结生产事，需查纸千张，数多如蚂蚁，缭乱无印象。参差又不齐，对此费思量，思量又思量，计来心头上：
    何不作成质量评估图，个个数据变圆点，
    几条界线分明画，高下参差入眼帘。
    哪批产品不合格，图上点子很明显；
    质量上升或下降，见图一目就了然。
    挂它在车间，人人都可见；
    存它作卡片，评比有档案。
    机器出毛病，图上现迹象。
    产品送出门，用户有保障。
    资料送给设计师，配合数据好计算；设计恰到最好处，功能效率大增长。
    质量评估图，好处讲不完，
    学它既不难，画它也简单。
    方法究如何？且听下文谈。
    质量是怎样度量的？
    要对质量作评估，先要使质量能够衡量，也就是把质量定量化。衡量质量的方法主要有两类：一类是度量数据，一类是计数数据。
    长度、直径、重量、寿命、速度、光洁度、化学成分、强度等等质量的指标，一般可以用尺度仪表来量，得出的数据都称为度量数据。从一批度量数据可以算出一个平均数（称为-x数据），用来度量这批数据的重心位置在哪里。还可以从把其中的最大数减去最小数，算出这批数据的范围（称为w数据），用来度量它们的参差程度。
    不是一切质量都允许用仪表尺度来量的，这时候我们可以在一批产品中计数出具某属性的件数，来衡量质量。例如废品数、次品数、破损数、污损数等等，都可以这样产生。这类数据称为计数数据。
    对这种在一批产品中计数某属性的件数的计数数据有两种表示法，一种是直接把计数得的数目写出来（简称为c数据），另一种是把它们折算成百分率写出来（简称为p数据）。例如在五十支钢笔中经检查发现有五支是次品，于是次品计数c＝5（是个c数据）；但也可以折算成次品率p＝5÷50＝0．10或10％（是个p数据）。
    有些产品不是一件件数的，计数数据就不能折成百分率。例如检查一丈丈的布匹中，有多少个疵点，检查一升升的自来水中，有多少个细菌。这是另一种计数数据，它们只能以c数据的形式出现。
    如果人有本事，能把产品制造得完全一样，那么对一批产品的质量的定量描述就很容易。因为其中任一件或任一部分的产品都能完全代表全部产品，定出部分的质量如何，就可以知道全部的质量。可是事情并不能这样称心如意，到如今大家不得不接受这样一个事实：只能做出一批批尺寸基本上相同的零件，但不可能制出两件尺寸完全相同的零件。即使精细的钟表零件，在显微镜下察看，尺寸仍然各有参差，不过其间的参差很小罢了。零件如此，其它产品也如此。炼钢厂炼不出含碳、硅、锰、硫量绝对相同的两炉钢，面粉厂里也磨不出粒度分布完全相同的两袋面粉。
    在产品质量上既有参差性，我们就不能够只凭一个零件或一份试样的观测和检查来估计整批零件的质量。大家可能很自然地想到：那么把每件产品质量都观测一下，岂非甚好。这种逐件检查的方法虽好，费工夫也实在大。现代工厂只对产量不大而规格要求极高的产品才这样做，例如对飞机引擎零件的检查就是这样。绝大多数的工业产品不能这样做。譬如生产螺丝钉，如果为了检查质量，要一只只去测量，就太费事了。还有损毁性的检查更是如此，不可能把生产的煤全都拿去化验，也不能够把生产的人造纤维全都拿去做拉力强度的试验。
    现在摆在我们面前的事情已很明显：对绝大多数的产品，不可能作百分之百的检查。即使对同一批产品作几次抽样检查，各次的结果也必然有参差。这种情况，如不采取科学的措施来处理，不但会对质量的评估有偏差，使评估的结果不能准确地反映客观情况，而且容易在工人与检查员间、在厂方与用户间、在甲方与乙方间造成不必要的矛盾，从而影响到质量的提高和生产的发展。
    问题在于设法找到一种有科学根据的定量方法来评估质量。如果大家都遵守这种方法，对质量的评估就有了一种共同语言。大家非但对质量的客观情况了解得更好，而且也可以基本上取得一致的意见。
    有没有这种评估质量的方法呢？有！
    学会这种方法的第一步，要学会画质量评估图。
    什么是质量评估图？
    质量评估图是作在有等分方格子的直角座标纸上的。按照上面所说的不同类的质量数据，有三种最常用的质量评估图：一种是有一组组度量数据的平均数?和范围w数据的质量评估图（简称为?和w图）；一种是计数数据的百分率p数据的质量评估图（简称为p图）；一种是计数数据本身c数据的质量评估图（简称为c图）。图1示出了这三种图的典型例子。它们的横座标都是顺次的样组号码；但?图的纵座标是平均数?，w图的是范围w，p图的是百分率p，c图的是计数c。在这三种图中，?图和w图须配合在一起使用；p图和c图则各只有一张图。在每种图上都有许多参差不齐忽上忽下的小圆点，它们代表从各个样组计算出来的或计数出来的数据。穿过这些小圆点的中间有一条横线，它们用实线画成，就是在正常稳定操作情况下所得数据的平均数线。在平均数线的上下各有两根虚线。靠得近一点的两根线叫做警戒上限和警戒下限。靠得远一点的两根线叫做行动上限和行动下限。这四根线总称为质量稳定界限。
    上面讲过一批批产品的质量数据必然是参差不齐的。但是其中有两种不同的情况：一种参差是偶然性的变差，这种参差往往原因众多，而且或者无法知道原因，或者即使知道也无法或不值得去控制它们。另一种参差是有原因的变差，这种变差的原因，有时很单纯，一般不外机器有毛病，操作方法或技术有问题，原料起变化等；把它找出来，加以改正，变差就会平伏下去。如果只有偶然变差而没有有因变差，我们就称质量是稳定的，如果在偶然变差之外还存在有因变差，质量就出现不稳定现象。
    那么怎样判别质量的稳定与否呢？这从质量评估图一眼就能看出来。如果质量是稳定的，图上的点子就会保持在上下限之内，它们越出警戒上限的机会（概率）不大，在一千个点子中，大约只有二十五个左右会越出去。越出警戒下限的概率也是千分之二十五；越出行动上限或者行动下限的概率就更小。如果质量稳定，在一千个点子中越出行动上限或行动下限的平均只有个把点子。
    如果越出这些上下限的点子数，多于上述应该有的数目，质量就判定为不稳定，就得寻根究底，找出原因。在图2中有三张p图说明三种不同的情况（?、w和c图可以仿此类推）。
    第一张图，在p图上出现废品率显著地有了上升。究其原因，发现刚好有一批新工人参加工作。经过训练，使他们技术熟练后，质量又回复到稳定。这是个操作技术在质量上的效应表现在评估图上的典型例子。
    第二张图，在p图上出现着一段废品率显著上升的点子。经调查，发现在这一段时期内所用的原料的质量是有问题的。经与原料供应单位交涉，原料质量回复正常后，p图上的点子又拉了回来。这是个原料对质量的效应表现在评估图上的典型例子。
    第三张图是在p图上原先出现质量既不好、又欠稳定的现象，后经研究，发现是某机器上某个调节器失灵的缘故，把它换装了一个新的，就使后来的点子获得新的较低废品率的水准，而且稳定性也控制住了。这是个设备对质量的效应表现在评估图上的典型例子。
    有人问：“在资本主义国家的统计书里，称这种方法为质量控制方法，这种图叫质量控制图。它们能控制质量吗？”我们说：“不能！”数学方法怎能控制质量呢？谁见过医生用体温记录图来控制病况？体温图只为医生提供病人病况的资料。评估图和体温图一样，充其量只能为管理人员提供质量的稳定和变迁情况的资料；要控制质量，必须依靠其它办法。为了不夸大这种方法的作用，我们称之为“质量评估方法”和“质量评估图”。
    有人可能说：“上图所说的情况，不用评估图，也能捉摸得出。”话虽如此，但过去的经验告诉我们，如不用质量评估图，只凭直觉，即使能发现一些情况，有时会发现得太迟，耽误了事情；或者有时把一单个偶然性数据的变差误认为是有因的；或者有时把重要的情况反而忽略过去了。总之，评估图可以成为工厂管理人员的得力工具，就好象医生有了体温计一样，有了质量评估图，质量的变动既能及时发现，又能辨别是偶然的还是有因的。如果在评估图中见到比预期为多的点子越出了上下稳定界限时，等于开亮了红灯警告大家：“出问题了，赶快研究吧！”
    当然，问题出在哪里，评估图不一定能提供具体的线索。在大多数情况下，须到过程本身中去寻找。但是，把几张质量评估图放在一起一比较，会有助于发现问题。下面就是两个典型例子。
    第一个例子是有三台机器，由三个人操作，原料都是来自同一批的，产品质量都不稳定。从三张质量评估图来看，在他们之间有着颇为相似的起落情况。如果问题出在机器或者操作上，怎能有这样的巧合呢？于是判断产品质量不稳定的原因，在于原料质量的不稳定。一个时候原料好了，各台机器的产品质量一齐都好；到另一个时候原料差了，各台机器的产品质量一齐都差（见图3）。我们看了这三张图，感觉到产品质量虽然在大幅度上起落一致，但细看个别点子的话，三者又毫无相同之处。究其原因，还是那随机抽样所引入的偶然性变差在作怪。可是它并不妨碍作出原料不稳定的判断。
    第二个例子是图4所示的九张评估图。这是三组工人轮流在三个班次上、在三个星期内所制产品的质量评估图。原先是想评比一下三个小组的工作质量，但从这些图来看，看得出这三组工人的工作质量好坏都有，不相上下，在各个星期之间的质量也无甚区别，倒是在三个班次之间明显地看出了日班的产品质量显著不好。后经调查发现，两个夜班的照明是人工照明，比起日班的日光照明在角度上比较合适，在亮度上比较适宜而且均匀，所以提高了工作质量。针对这种情况，日班的照明仿夜班的那样作了改善，质量立即上升到和夜班一样。
    另有一种用处是当评估图上的点子有一种缓慢的，但定向的转移趋向时，往往在人的直觉还没有觉察出来之前，它已显示出来了。请看上面图5中的例子。一种钢料的强度由于某种原因正在逐渐下降，这种趋势在该图上早在三月下旬就已经很明显地显示出来，在警戒下限以下的点子已经超过了允许的数目。使用这张图，可以及时发现并纠正这种情况。
    当工厂负责人在质量与成本之间权衡得失，想要作出一项决定时，就用得着质量评估图。请比较下面图6中的两张-x图。左边一张图表示出用一种过程制的螺钉，尺寸变差很小，质量很好，太好了！但成本很高；右边一张图表示出用另一种过程制出的螺钉，尺寸的变差虽大些，质量差些，但成本很低，而且并没有超过设计规格。（关于设计界限在评估图中与稳定界限的关系，在本文中从略。）当然，工厂负责人采用了右边的过程来生产螺钉。
    还有一种用处是在工业产品的评比方面。如果画有两种牌子的同一产品的质量评估图，一眼就能看出哪个牌子的质量好些，哪个牌子的质量差些。对作评比工作的人来说，质量评估图无异提供了一个统一的标准。
    如果是同一批产品，经两道抽样检查手续，譬如说在出厂前由厂方检查过一道，出厂后由用户再检查一道，由于抽样的缘故，这两道质量检查的结果虽不尽相同，但是它们的波动范围必然是差不多的。只要质量稳定，总是有大约千分之二十五的概率越出警戒上限或下限，有大约千分之一的概率越出行动上限或下限。这样一来，在厂方和用户之间在质量检查上就有了共同的语言，双方的协作关系就会得到加强。
    在工人与检查员之间，有了质量评估图，也等于有了共同的语言，在他们之间的关系必然会更加好起来。
    质量评估图可以挂在车间里或画在黑板上让大家看。表示质量的点子可以每天或每星期加上去，这对工人来说，既是一个工作质量的客观和全面的评估，又是一种督促。
    质量评估图可以画在卡片上，作为档案，永久保存。这种卡片不多占地方，查起来方便，以它作调查统计也最省时间，而且既可以从它看得出各车间各产品质量的变迁情况，也可以看得出操作人员在技术上的提高情况。
    大多数工厂使用了质量评估图以后，在技术操作工人中获得了好评。下面是一项资料所载的调查结果：
    问：有了质量评估图，你对于你自己的工作比以前更了解吗？
    答：更为了解（占总人数百分之八十一）。答：不见得（占百分之十九）。
    问：有了质量评估图，你对工作比以前更负责吗？
    答：更加负责（占总人数百分之七十四）。答：不见得（占百分之二十六）。
    问：有了质量评估图，你对自己工作的质量比以前更能掌握吗？
    答：更能掌握（占总人数百分之八十七）。答：不见得（占百分之十三）。
    问：有了质量评估图，你同质量检验员比以前意见更一致吗？
    答：更为一致（占总人数百分之七十二）。答：不见得（占百分之二十八）。
    这样看起来，质量评估图在工业中确实可以起一定的作用。了解它，运用它，总是一桩有益的事。
    以上所介绍的不过是质量评估方法的一个开端，各种质量评估图的画法，质量评估所需的抽样方法，质量评估结果与设计或标准规格之间的联系，等等，都还没有讲。
    质量评估方法是数理统计方法中的一个重要分支。它在现代工业中受到广泛的使用。它本身也随着各门各类工业的具体要求而多样化。这里所介绍的不过是几种最基本而简单的质量评估方法。我们相信这种方法一经交给工人群众，一定会有更新更完善更切实的质量评估方法发展出来，为社会主义建设贡献力量。（附图片）
