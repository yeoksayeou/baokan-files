    Spring breeze blows again.
    "Wildfires never die, the spring breeze blows and brings them back to life."
    Another large-scale black people's anti-tyranny struggle has erupted in the Watts district of Los Angeles, USA. More than six hundred black people bravely fought against several hundred fully armed reactionary police, opening a new page in the American black people's liberation movement.
    In August of last year, the black people in Watts launched a vigorous anti-tyranny struggle. The American ruling authorities suppressed it with violent means, but the sparks of anger among the black people did not die out, but smoldered under the ashes. When the new opportunity came, it burned into a raging flame, emitting heat and light. Not only that, after the baptism of that struggle, the black people's consciousness has been further raised, and they have become more tempered and stronger. The re-eruption of this anti-tyranny struggle is not accidental, but inevitable.
    In fact, the American ruling authorities are not unaware of this. Not long ago, an official U.S. survey report worriedly admitted that the situation in Los Angeles was still "very serious," "prone to erupt," and that "the anger of black citizens is burning in their hearts." Is the situation in other parts of the United States any different? However, the Johnson administration is still attempting to contain the American black people's anti-tyranny struggle with the counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy of political deception and military suppression, which of course is impossible.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively different methods." The contradiction between the American black people and the American ruling group is an antagonistic contradiction, which can only be resolved through revolutionary methods. More and more American black people have understood this truth, and they have put forward the slogan of "destroying the entire American economic and political system of exploitation." As long as the American imperialist system does not end, the American black people's struggle for liberation will not stop for a single day.

    春风吹又生
    “野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。”
    美国洛杉矶市瓦茨区又爆发了大规模的黑人抗暴斗争。六百多名黑人群众同好几百全副武装的反动警察展开英勇的搏斗，这又揭开了美国黑人争取解放运动的新的一页。
    去年八月间瓦茨区的黑人曾经掀起一次轰轰烈烈的抗暴斗争。美国统治当局用暴力手段把它镇压下去了，但是，黑人群众愤怒的火种并没有熄灭，而是在灰烬下面隐燃着，等到新的时机，便又燃烧起熊熊的火焰，发出热和光。不仅如此，黑人群众经过了那一次斗争的洗礼，觉悟更加提高了，也锻炼得更加坚强了。这一次抗暴斗争的重新爆发并不是偶然的，而是势所必然。
    其实，美国统治当局对于这一点并不是不知道。不久以前美国的一份官方调查报告就忧心忡忡地承认，洛杉矶的局势依然“非常严重”，“易于爆发”，“黑人市民的愤怒在胸中燃烧”。在美国其他各地，情况何尝不是这样？但是，约翰逊政府还是企图用政治欺骗和武力镇压的反革命两手策略来遏止美国黑人的抗暴斗争，这当然是办不到的。
    毛泽东同志说过：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”美国黑人同美国统治集团的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，只能通过革命的方法解决。越来越多的美国黑人已经懂得这个道理，他们纷纷提出“摧毁整个美国经济和政治的剥削制度”的口号。美国的帝国主义制度一天不结束，美国黑人争取解放的斗争就一天不会停止。
