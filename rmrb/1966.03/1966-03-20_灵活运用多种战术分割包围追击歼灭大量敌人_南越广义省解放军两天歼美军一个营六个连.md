    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th: The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency has provided supplementary reports that in the battles of March 4th and 5th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam annihilated one battalion and six companies of the U.S. Marine Corps, severely damaged two U.S. battalions, shot down twenty enemy planes, and destroyed twelve M-113 armored personnel carriers.
    The Liberation News Agency reported the battle details of this great victory, saying: In the ten days from February 21st to March 2nd, the military and civilians of Son Tinh District in Quang Ngai Province continuously destroyed a section of Highway No. 1 leading from Quang Ngai City to Chu Lai in Quang Nam Province, and annihilated more than 220 enemies and destroyed twelve enemy military vehicles.
    In order to clear this section of the highway, the American bandits and their running dogs dispatched seven battalions of U.S. Marine Corps and puppet troops.
    On the morning of March 4th, a batch of U.S. troops landed by helicopter in Dong Giap, Khanh My, Phu Thanh, and Highland 62 in Son Tinh District, northwest of Quang Ngai City. At the same time, the enemy also set out from Binh Son District and Son Tinh District in two routes, under the cover of M-113 armored vehicles, and invaded An Thoi and Dai Loc, south and north of Dong Giap, Khanh My, and Phu Thanh, in order to cover the airborne U.S. troops.
    At eight o'clock that morning, as soon as the U.S. Marine Corps landed on Highland 62, it was immediately met with fierce mortar fire from the Liberation Army, which was waiting in full battle array. The Liberation Army quickly divided into three routes and charged towards the highland. After an hour of fierce fighting, the Liberation Army annihilated a portion of the U.S. troops on the mountainside. Then, the Liberation Army pursued their victory, charged to the top of the mountain, and engaged the enemy, finally seizing the commanding height by three o'clock in the afternoon.
    At this time, the American bandits were in a very unfavorable situation. They dispatched a large number of planes to indiscriminately bomb, attempting to cover the U.S. infantry to reoccupy Highland 62. The Liberation Army heroically repelled fifteen U.S. counterattacks, again annihilated hundreds of U.S. troops, and shot down three enemy planes. That night, the Liberation Army annihilated the entire First Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Third Division of the U.S. Marine Corps west of Highland 62.
    Enemy troops reinforcing Highland 62 from Dong Giap were also intercepted by the Liberation Army. The soldiers surrounded the enemy, divided them into small pieces, and annihilated them. By half past five in the afternoon, the Liberation Army had annihilated two U.S. companies and shot down four enemy planes.
    On the morning of the 5th, a battalion of U.S. troops landed one kilometer southwest of Highland 62, attempting to occupy Ma Zu Mountain and Nen Mountain. But their four attacks were repelled by the Liberation Army. On Nen Mountain, a five-man combat group of the Liberation Army repelled four attacks by a battalion of U.S. troops, killing 45 enemies and shooting down two helicopters. Two soldiers calmly fired in the fierce battle, eliminating twelve enemies.
    That night, the Liberation Army attacked the enemy in Phuc Binh Commune and annihilated two U.S. companies, shooting down one plane. U.S. troops coming from Khanh My to reinforce were also severely attacked by the Liberation Army. The enemy tried their best to break out of the encirclement, but their eight breakouts all ended in disastrous defeat. The Liberation Army annihilated two more companies of the enemy.
    This great victory of the military and civilians of Son Tinh District is one of the many great victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians at the beginning of this year. It shows that the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai Province have a high level of organization and command, a tenacious fighting spirit, and are able to flexibly use various tactics to annihilate a large number of the U.S. aggressors' forces.

    灵活运用多种战术分割包围追击歼灭大量敌人
    南越广义省解放军两天歼美军一个营六个连
    据新华社河内十九日电  据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方广义省解放武装力量在三月四日和五日两天的战斗中，歼灭美国海军陆战队一个营和六个连，重创美军两个营，击落敌机二十架，摧毁M—113型装甲车十二辆。
    解放通讯社报道这次大捷的战斗经过说：在从二月二十一日到三月二日的十天中，广义省山晶县军民曾接连破坏了一段从广义市通往广南省朱莱的一号公路，并且歼灭敌人二百二十多名，摧毁敌人军车十二辆。
    美国强盗及其走狗为了打通这段公路，出动美国海军陆战队和伪军主力部队七个营。
    三月四日早晨，一批美军乘直升飞机在广义市西北面山晶县的同甲、庆美、富成等地和六二高地着陆。与此同时，敌人还分两路从平山县和山晶县城出发，在M—113型装甲车的掩护下，向同甲、庆美和富成等地南面和北面的安恬和大禄进犯，以掩护空降的美军。
    这一天上午八点钟，美国海军陆战部队刚刚在六二高地上着陆，就立即遭到严阵以待的解放军迫击炮火的猛烈轰击。解放军迅速地分成三路向高地冲锋。经过一个钟头的激烈战斗，解放军在山半腰就歼灭了一部分美军。接着，解放军乘胜追击，冲上山顶，同敌人展开战斗，一直打到下午三点钟，终于夺取了制高点。
    这时，美国强盗陷入了十分不利的境地。他们出动大批飞机滥肆轰炸，妄图掩护美国步兵重占六二高地。解放军英勇击退美军十五次反扑，再次歼灭数以百计的美军，并击落三架敌机。当天夜里，解放军又一举全歼六二高地西面的美国海军陆战队第三师第三团第一营。
    从同甲向六二高地增援的敌军也遭到解放军的截击。战士们把敌人团团围住，分割成许多小块加以歼灭。到下午五点半钟，解放军又在这里全歼美军两个连，击落美机四架。
    五日早晨，一营美军在六二高地西南面一公里处着陆，妄图占领马祖山和嫩山。但它们的四次进攻都被解放军击退。在嫩山，解放军的一个五人战斗小组接连击退了一个营美军的四次进攻，打死敌人四十五名，击落直升飞机二架。有两名战士在激烈战斗中沉着地射击，消灭敌人十二名。
    当天夜里，解放军袭击福平乡的敌人，又全歼美军两个连，打落飞机一架。从庆美前来增援的美军也遭到解放军的迎头痛击。敌人竭力要冲出重围，但是他们的八次突围都告惨败。解放军又歼敌两个连。
    山晶县军民的这次大捷是越南南方军民今年初的多次大捷之一，它表明：广义省解放武装力量具有高度的组织和指挥水平，有顽强的战斗精神，能够灵活地运用多种战术，歼灭美国侵略军的大批有生力量。
