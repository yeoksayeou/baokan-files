    Editor's Note: The quality of all work depends mainly on people's mental state. When people's thinking is revolutionized, work can advance by leaps and bounds. The broad masses of cadres and people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, responding to the call of the Regional Party Committee, have been using the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to summarize their work for nearly a year, greatly breaking down metaphysics and conservative thinking that sticks to old ways and is content with the status quo. Their mental outlook has been completely renewed, and the progress of their work has also changed greatly. This is a vivid example of highlighting politics and promoting work.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "It is wrong to look at our work from the viewpoint of affirming everything or negating everything." In our revolutionary work, achievements are always the main thing, but there will always be shortcomings or errors; sufficiently estimating shortcomings or errors is not to obliterate achievements and advantages. Therefore, we must treat all our work with "one divides into two," neither affirming everything and saying that everything is good, nor negating everything and saying that everything is bad.
    Advantages and disadvantages, advanced and backward, are revealed in comparison. Using the method of "one divides into two" to compare with all aspects, seeing both achievements and shortcomings, can enable advanced units to discover that there is always a higher level, and be determined to climb to a higher level; it can enable backward units to find gaps and establish the ambition to catch up with and surpass the advanced.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee is precisely using Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical view of "one divides into two" to require cadres and the masses throughout the region to seriously summarize their work and correctly treat their achievements and shortcomings. In the past nearly twenty years, the people of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia have made great achievements in politics, economy, and culture. However, they believe that compared with advanced regions and advanced units in the country, agricultural and animal husbandry production in the autonomous region still has a backward side. The Regional Party Committee sounded the alarm to the broad masses of cadres, calling on everyone to "dare to admit backwardness and be brave to change backwardness," promoting cadres to eliminate blindness and enhance revolutionary consciousness. For example, the Jerim League provided more than 4.2 billion catties of marketable grain to the state from 1958 to 1964, which is a great contribution. However, the League Party Committee used the method of "one divides into two" at three three-level cadre meetings, focusing on checking the backward side of agriculture. On this basis, they vigorously engaged in water conservancy and stable and high-yield farmland, ensuring that the League achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year despite 300 days of severe drought.
    Mind transforms into matter. The thought of "one divides into two" has thus powerfully promoted the work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This experience of theirs deserves great attention from comrades in all regions and on all fronts.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th: The broad masses of cadres and people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, are universally talking about "one divides into two," powerfully breaking down the conservative thinking of some people who stick to old ways and are content with the status quo, promoting ideological revolutionization, and bringing about a new situation of high tides in agricultural and animal husbandry production.
    In the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, all parts of the autonomous region emphasize creative study and application, and combine it with their own work to launch a nationwide discussion and summary. This discussion has been going on for nearly a year. In the discussion and summary, cadres and the masses at all levels have both seen the achievements and found the gaps, seeing the shortcomings and backwardness. Affirming achievements and admitting backwardness, uncovering the lid of backwardness, digging out the roots of backwardness, and being determined to change backwardness has further stimulated the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, which has played a huge role in promoting agricultural and animal husbandry production in the region.
    Inner Mongolia, the earliest established ethnic autonomous region, has achieved great achievements in all aspects of its work after nearly twenty years of construction. Grain production and livestock have increased by multiples, the political life of people of all ethnic groups is lively and vigorous, and economic and cultural life is unprecedentedly prosperous. In the face of this great situation, the broad masses of people demand continuous revolution, continuous development, and a thorough change in the backwardness left over from the history of the autonomous region. However, the understanding of some people cannot keep up with the development of the situation. They lack the viewpoint of "one divides into two," and do not look at problems with a developmental perspective, but are proud and complacent in the face of a good situation, sticking to old ways and stagnating.
    This is a "living thought" of some cadres in the autonomous region. In response to this situation, the Regional Party Committee, in studying Chairman Mao's works, called on everyone last year to look at their work from the viewpoint of "one divides into two." The Party Committee analyzed the great situation in the autonomous region and pointed out that in agricultural and animal husbandry production, it is necessary to compare with advanced regions in the country and "dare to admit backwardness and change backwardness." The Party Committee repeatedly pointed out at several meetings that there is still a backward side to agricultural and animal husbandry production in the autonomous region: low agricultural yields and unstable total output; in animal husbandry, grassland construction cannot keep up with the needs of livestock development. This situation is not in line with the development of the national socialist revolution and socialist construction, and is not in line with the important tasks that the autonomous region undertakes in national socialist construction and international struggle. Whether to dare to admit backwardness and whether to be determined to change backwardness is a question of continuous revolution or stopping and not moving forward, of adhering to dialectical materialism or adhering to metaphysics. The Party Committee required cadres at all levels and people of all ethnic groups to combine the great study of Chairman Mao's works and launch a nationwide discussion and summary.
    Chairman Mao's philosophical thought opened people's minds. In the great discussion and summary, people talked a lot about "one divides into two," greatly breaking down metaphysics and conservative thinking that sticks to old ways and is content with the status quo.
    From the perspective of league and banner (county) leaders, the first to admit the backwardness of agricultural production was the Jerim League, which had made great contributions to the country. This league has only over 1.1 million agricultural people. In the seven years from 1958 to 1964, they provided more than 4.2 billion catties of marketable grain to the state in addition to self-sufficiency, which is a considerable figure. However, last year the League Party Committee convened three three-level cadre meetings and talked a lot about the problem of agricultural backwardness three times. The League Party Committee used the method of "one divides into two" to summarize eighteen years of work, taking Dazhai as an example, finding gaps, presenting contradictions, uncovering the lid of backwardness, revealing the state of mind, and digging out the ideological roots. Through the great discussion, the people of the entire league were educated to establish the idea of ​​farming for the revolution and to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution. In the same year, a movement to vigorously engage in water conservancy and build stable and high-yield fields was launched throughout the league. The farmland water conservancy projects built within one year were equivalent to the achievements of the past three years. In this way, it was ensured that an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved in the case of a continuous drought of 300 days last year, and the total grain output was more than 300 million catties more than in 1961, which was a particularly large bumper harvest.
    Daring to admit backwardness is the attitude of a revolutionary. Admitting backwardness can find gaps and tap potential. Constantly finding gaps and constantly tapping potential will continuously revolutionize. This is the conclusion drawn by Zhao Bin, secretary of the Party branch of the Xiaoxiniuboluo Brigade, in leading all members to catch up with the Dangpudi Brigade. Xiaoxiniuboluo is a brigade of the Wusan Commune in Chifeng County, Zhaowuda League. Before liberation, the grain yield per mu here was only 70 to 80 catties. After communization, the yield per mu increased to 200 catties, and everyone felt that it was almost enough. In this way, the yield per unit area has been hovering around 200 catties every year. They were only 18 miles away from Dangpudi Brigade, a nationally renowned Dazhai-style typical unit, but no team cadres had visited Dangpudi for many years. People said that Dangpudi was doing well, and Zhao Bin thought: You plant the land, and I also plant the land. Who is much better than whom? Later, when he visited Dangpudi, he was shocked. In the early years, Dangpudi was filled with yellow wind and rolling sand and rocks. Now, as soon as you enter the Dangpudi border, the trees are lined up, the canals are like nets, and the earth has changed. When he came back, he said to everyone: "In the past, the superiors criticized us for being complacent, and I was not convinced. Now it seems that this problem is not small!" Since then, he has led the cadres of large and small teams and some members to Dangpudi ten times to study the spirit of Dangpudi members farming for the revolution and establish the ambition of "Foolish Old Man." In two years, the entire brigade moved away dozens of large sandbags, leveled more than 3,000 mu of land, built water conservancy, built terraces, and built a large number of protective forest belts, and agricultural production quickly caught up. In the past few years, the average yield per unit area of ​​this brigade has only increased by three to five catties per mu. In 1965, there was a drought for nine months, and the yield per unit area increased by more than 120 catties at once, jumping over the "Yellow River." When the whole team had a big discussion and summary last winter, many members expressed that they would always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind," and continuously revolutionize and move forward.
    Cadres in various places have realized in the great discussion that to dare to admit backwardness and change backwardness, the key lies in the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres at all levels and in the mental state of leading cadres. The Hetao area of ​​the Bayannur League in the Autonomous Region has excellent water conservancy and irrigation conditions. The water of the Yellow River is inexhaustible, and millions of acres of farmland are guaranteed against drought and flood. However, for a considerable period of time, some leading cadres from the league to the banner (county) carried the burden of complacency, thinking that the grain they produced was enough to eat and use, and they could also hand over more marketable grain to the country, and were satisfied with the fact that the yield per unit area had increased compared with the past, so agricultural production has been developing slowly. Some people still felt wronged when the leadership criticized them for being backward in agriculture. Since last year, combined with the great study of Chairman Mao's works and the socialist education movement, the leading cadres of the league and banner (county) have discussed the problem of agricultural backwardness several times and uncovered the lid of backwardness. Some people checked that they were carrying the burden of pride, complacency, and sticking to old ways because they were not standing high enough politically, could not see far enough, did not look to advanced regions, and lacked revolutionary ambition, not having the motherland in mind and an eye on the world; some people realized that in the past, they only relied on the favorable conditions of the Yellow River water in agricultural production, but did not make great efforts to engage in farmland capital construction, lying on the favorable conditions and being complacent and satisfied; some checked that they were high above the past, divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, afraid of hardship, and their thinking was stagnant. At the enlarged meeting of the League Party Committee held last winter, the leading cadres of the League Party Committee took the lead in self-revolution with Chairman Mao's viewpoint of "one divides into two," digging out the roots of agricultural backwardness from the ideological level. Since then, the situation has changed somewhat. Since last year, all banners and counties have vigorously engaged in land leveling, canal system matching, and drainage and alkali control projects to build stable and high-yield fields. They are determined to further highlight politics, realize the revolutionization of leadership, make full use of favorable conditions, and catch up with advanced regions in a short period of time.
    This great discussion that started with "one divides into two" has enabled people to put down their burdens, rejuvenate their spirits, and liberate their minds. This is a good start to the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres at all levels in the Autonomous Region. With the development of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, this discussion is still continuing to deepen in various places. The experience of many places proves that only by carrying out ideological revolutionization deeply and thoroughly can people's understanding be more in line with objective reality, and the production revolution to transform nature can be carried out in a down-to-earth manner.

    破除形而上学　反对故步自封　坚持不断革命
    内蒙右用“一分为二”的哲学思想总结工作
    广大干部和群众找差距挖潜力促进农牧业加速发展
    编者按：一切工作做得好坏，主要决定于人们的精神状态。人的思想革命化了，工作就能大步前进。内蒙古自治区的广大干部、群众，响应区党委的号召，将近一年以来，运用“一分为二”的观点总结自己的工作，大破形而上学，大破故步自封、满足现状的保守思想，精神面貌焕然一新，工作进展情况也就大变。这是一个突出政治、推进工作的生动事例。
    毛泽东同志说过，“不论是用肯定一切的观点或者否定一切的观点来看我们的工作，都是错误的。”我们的革命工作，成绩总是主要的，但是，也总会有缺点或错误；足够地估计缺点或错误，并不是抹煞成绩和优点。因此，对待我们的一切工作，必须“一分为二”，既不能全盘肯定，说一切都好，更不能全部否定，说一切都坏。
    优点和缺点，先进和落后，是在比较当中揭露出来的。运用“一分为二”的方法，同各方面作比较，既看到成绩，又看到缺点，这就能使先进单位发现天外有天，决心更上一层楼；使后进单位找到差距，树立赶超先进的雄心壮志。
    内蒙古自治区党委正是运用毛泽东同志的“一分为二”的辩证观点，要求全区干部群众，认真总结工作，正确对待自己的成绩和缺点。近二十年来，内蒙古各族人民在政治、经济、文化等方面都取得了很大成绩，但是，他们认为，同全国先进地区和先进单位比较，自治区的农牧业生产还存在着落后的一面。区党委给广大干部敲起警钟，号召大家要“敢于承认落后，勇于改变落后”，促进广大干部去掉盲目性，增强革命自觉性。象哲里木盟，从一九五八年到一九六四年，向国家提供了四十二亿多斤商品粮，这是很大的贡献。可是，盟委在三次三级干部会议上，用“一分为二”的方法，着重检查农业落后的一面。他们在这个基础上大搞水利，大搞稳产高产农田，保证全盟去年在大旱三百天的情况下，取得空前大丰收。
    精神变物质。“一分为二”的思想，就是这样有力地推动了内蒙古自治区的工作。他们的这个经验，值得各地区、各战线的同志们极大的重视。
    新华社呼和浩特十九日电　内蒙古自治区广大干部和群众，活学活用毛主席著作，上上下下大谈“一分为二”，有力地破除了一些人故步自封的保守思想，促进了思想革命化，带来了农牧业生产高涨的新形势。
    自治区各地在学习毛主席著作运动中，强调活学活用，结合自己的工作展开全民性的大讨论、大总结。这一场讨论已经进行了将近一年的时间。各级干部和群众在讨论和总结中，既看到成就的一面，也找到了差距，看到不足和落后的一面。肯定成绩，又承认落后，揭落后盖子，挖落后根子，下决心改变落后，这就进一步激发了广大干部和群众的革命精神，对全区农牧业生产起了巨大的推动作用。
    内蒙古这个成立最早的民族自治区，经过将近二十年的建设，各方面的工作都获得巨大的成就，粮食生产和牲畜有了成倍和几倍的增长，各族人民的政治生活生动活泼，经济、文化生活空前繁荣。在这种大好形势面前，广大人民要求不断革命，不断发展，彻底改变自治区历史上遗留下来的落后面貌。但是，也有些人的认识跟不上形势的发展，他们缺乏“一分为二”的观点，不是用发展的眼光来看问题，而是在好形势面前骄傲自满，故步自封，停滞不前。
    这是自治区一部分干部的一个“活思想”。针对这一情况，自治区党委在学习毛主席著作时，从去年就号召大家用“一分为二”的观点来看待自己的工作。党委分析了自治区的大好形势，同时指出，在农牧业生产上要同全国先进的地区比较，要“敢于承认落后，改变落后”。党委在几次会议上一再指出，自治区的农牧业生产还存在着落后的一面：农业单产低，总产不稳定；畜牧业方面，草原建设跟不上牲畜发展的需要。这种状况，是和全国社会主义革命、社会主义建设的发展不相适应的，是和自治区在全国社会主义建设和国际斗争中所担负的重要任务不相适应的。敢不敢承认落后和是否下决心改变落后，这是不断革命还是停止不前，是坚持辩证唯物论还是坚持形而上学的问题。党委要求各级干部和各族人民结合大学毛主席著作，展开一次全民大讨论，大总结。
    毛主席的哲学思想打开了人们的脑筋，在大讨论大总结中，人们大讲“一分为二”，大破形而上学，大破故步自封、满足现状的保守思想。
    从盟、旗（县）领导来说，首先承认农业生产落后的，是对国家作了很大贡献的哲里木盟。这个盟仅有一百一十多万农业人口，从一九五八年到一九六四年的七年中，他们在自给之余还向国家提供了四十二亿多斤商品粮，这是一个可观的数字。可是去年盟党委召开了三次三级干部会议，三次大讲农业落后问题。盟党委用“一分为二”的方法总结十八年的工作，拿大寨作榜样，找差距，摆矛盾，揭落后盖子，亮精神状态，挖思想根源。通过大讨论教育全盟人民，树立为革命种田的思想，发扬不断革命精神。就在这一年，全盟兴起了一个大搞水利、建设稳产高产田的运动。一年之内兴修的农田水利工程，等于过去三年的成绩。这样，就保证了在去年持续三百天大旱的情况下，取得了空前的丰收，粮食总产量比特大丰收的一九六一年还多三亿多斤。
    敢于承认落后是一种革命者的态度。承认落后，就能够找到差距，挖掘潜力。不断找差距，不断挖潜力，就会不断革命。这是小西牛波罗大队党支部书记赵斌在领导全体社员追赶当铺地大队的过程中得出的结论。小西牛波罗是昭乌达盟赤峰县五三公社的一个大队，解放前这里亩产粮食只有七八十斤，公社化以后，亩产量提高到二百斤，大家感到差不多了。这样一来，单位面积产量就年年在二百斤左右打转转。他们和全国著名的大寨式典型单位当铺地大队只隔十八里，队干部却多年没人到当铺地去看看。人们说当铺地搞得好，赵斌心想：你种地，我也种地，谁比谁强多少？后来，他到当铺地一参观，才大吃一惊。早年的当铺地是黄风迷路，沙石滚滚，如今一进当铺地地界，绿树成行，水渠如网，大地变了样。回来他向大家说：“过去上级批评我们有自满情绪，我还不服气。如今看来，这毛病还不轻哩！”从此，他带领大小队干部和一些社员前后十下当铺地，学习当铺地社员为革命种田的精神，大立“愚公”之志。全大队在两年里搬走了几十个大沙包，平整了三千多亩土地，修水利，修梯田，大造防护林带，农业生产很快赶上去了。过去几年，这个大队的平均单位面积产量每亩不过提高三五斤。一九六五年大旱九个月，单位面积产量一下子提高了一百二十多斤，一跃过了“黄河”。去冬全队大讨论、大总结的时候，许多社员表示要永远记住毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，不断革命，不断前进。
    各地干部在大讨论中认识到，要敢于承认落后，改变落后，关键在于各级领导干部的思想革命化，在于领导干部的精神状态。自治区巴彦淖尔盟的河套地区，有极好的水利灌溉条件，黄河水用之不尽，数百万亩农田旱涝保收。但相当长时期以来，从盟到旗（县）有些领导干部，背着自满的包袱，认为打的粮食够吃够用，还能向国家交出较多的商品粮，满足于单产比过去有所增加，因而农业生产一直发展缓慢。领导上批评他们农业落后，有些人内心还感到委屈。从去年以来，结合大学毛主席著作和社会主义教育运动，盟、旗（县）的领导干部几次讨论农业落后的问题，揭开了落后的盖子。有的人检查出自己背着骄傲自满、故步自封的包袱，是由于政治上站得不高，看得不远，不向先进地区看齐，缺乏革命的雄心壮志，不是心怀祖国，放眼世界；有的人认识到，过去在农业生产上只依靠黄河水的有利条件，而不下大力搞农田基本建设，躺在有利的条件上自满自足；有的检查自己过去高高在上，脱离群众，脱离实际，害怕艰苦，思想停滞。在去年冬季召开的盟党委扩大会议上，盟党委的领导干部用毛主席“一分为二”的观点带头自我革命，从思想上挖了农业落后的根子，从此，局面有所转变。去年以来，各旗、县都大搞土地平整、渠系配套和排水、治碱工程，建设稳产高产田。他们决心要进一步突出政治，实现领导革命化，充分利用有利条件，在短期内赶上先进地区。
    这场从“一分为二”开始的大讨论，使得人们放下包袱，精神焕发，思想解放。这是自治区各级领导干部思想革命化的一个良好的开端。随着大学毛主席著作运动的开展，这场讨论还在各地继续深入地进行。许多地方的经验证明，只有把思想革命化搞深搞透，人的认识比较符合客观实际，改造自然的生产革命才能扎扎实实地搞好。
