    Doing a good job at the point, is for the sake of the surface.
    Regarding the current production in Fengjing Commune, Yuxi County, the leadership initially abandoned the work on the surface and organized the main labor force to open mountains and build economic forest sample mountains. This practice was divorced from the immediate needs of the local masses and was criticized by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, the cadres of Fengjing Commune, in accordance with the needs of the masses, rearranged production and established models in soil improvement, ditch repair, and seedling cultivation, giving play to the demonstration and leading role of these models in the current production campaign, and more forcefully led the mass production campaign to strive for a relatively large increase in production this year.
    The "Yunnan Daily" published an editorial saying that, whether from the perspective of striving for a relatively large increase in production this year or from the perspective of the main responsibilities of leadership work, the work on the surface occupies a prominent and important position in the entire leadership work.
    Is the work at the point not important? Hasn't the higher level always emphasized that leaders at all levels should personally stay at the point to gain direct experience? That's right, the work at the point is indeed important. The reason why the work at the point is important is precisely because the point can drive and guide the work on the surface. If the significance of using the point to drive the surface is abandoned, and the work at the point is understood in isolation and one-sidedly, then it is incorrect and harmful. We say that it is very important for leaders to stay at the point, precisely in relation to the point-surface relationship. Doing a good job at the point, in the final analysis, is for the sake of doing a good job at the surface.
    We should be like Fengjing Commune, starting from the actual situation of the current production campaign in the local area, and strengthen the leadership of the production campaign in a timely manner. Whatever the current production campaign needs, we should create that model. Our purpose is to better lead the three major revolutionary movements through model setting, using the point to drive the surface, and to achieve better and faster development of agricultural production. At present, this means achieving a relatively large increase in production this year.

    搞好点，是为了面
    玉溪县冯井公社领导当前生产，开始，丢下面上当前的工作，组织主要劳动力去开山，搞经济林木样板山。这种做法脱离了当地群众当前的迫切需要，受到了贫农下中农的批评。后来，冯井公社的干部按照群众的需要，重新安排生产，在改土、修沟、育苗等生产活动中，办改土、修沟、育苗等样板，发挥这些样板在当前生产运动中的示范、带头作用，把争取今年较大幅度增产的群众性生产运动更有力地领导起来。
    《云南日报》发表社论说，无论从争取今年较大幅度增产的任务来看，或从领导工作的主要职责来看，面上的工作在整个领导工作中都占有突出重要的地位。
    点上的工作不是很重要吗？上级不是一直强调各级领导要亲自蹲点，获得直接经验吗？不错，点上的工作是确实重要的。点上工作之所以重要，正是因为点能够带动、指导面上的工作，如果离开了以点带面的意义，孤立地、片面地理解点上的工作，则是不对的、有害的。我们说领导蹲点十分重要，是就点面关系来说的。搞好点，归根结底是为了搞好面。
    我们应该象冯井公社那样，从当地当前生产运动的实际出发，及时加强生产运动的领导。当前生产运动需要什么，就搞什么样板。我们的目的是通过办样板，以点带面，把三大革命运动领导得更好，使农业生产得到更好更快的发展，就目前来说，就是要使今年的生产有较大幅度的增长。
