	Brief Comments
	Every Bush and Tree an Enemy Soldier

	The American aggressors are terrified and live in constant anxiety in the vast ocean of the people's war in South Vietnam. It is said that American troops stationed in rubber plantations north of Saigon discovered that the containers hanging on rubber trees to collect latex were being used by guerrillas to indicate the position of American infantry. In the central part of South Vietnam, the American First Cavalry Division discovered that villagers in Bình Định province were grazing cattle in certain pastures to indicate the deployment of American troops.
	These situations illustrate that, for the South Vietnamese army and people, every mountain, river, bush, and tree is at their service; for the American aggressors, every bush and tree is an enemy soldier.

	Flee Early
	Chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell, admitted that the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam "is not a popular war," and he also said: "I don't think we can let this war go on indefinitely." Logically, he should draw a logical conclusion from this, which is that the United States should quickly wash its hands and quit. However, this senator said something like "Americans have pride and will not allow themselves to run away with their tails between their legs." So, what should be done? It seems that the American aggressors, with this so-called "pride," will only be kicked out of Vietnam, head and tail, by the South Vietnamese people after suffering enough.

    三言两语
    草木皆兵
    美国侵略者在南越人民战争的汪洋大海中心惊胆跳，惶惶不可终日。据说，据守在西贡以北的橡胶园中的美军发现，橡胶树上挂着的接胶汁的容器被游击队用来表明美国步兵的位置。在南越中部的美国第一骑兵师则发现，平定省的村民在某些牧场上放牛，以表明美军的部署。
    这些情况说明，对于越南南方军民，是山川草木皆为我用；对于美国侵略者，则成了草木皆兵。
      逃跑趁早
    美国参议院军事委员会主席拉塞尔承认，美国侵越战争“不是一场得人心的战争”，他还说：“我认为我们让这场战争无止境地进行下去是不行的”。按理他由此应当得出一个合乎逻辑的结论，这就是美国赶快洗手不干。但是，这位参议员却说什么“美国人有自傲感，不会让自己夹着尾巴逃跑”。那末，怎么办呢？看来，有这种所谓“自傲感”的美国侵略者，只有在吃够了苦头之后，被南越人民连头带尾巴从越南的土地上踢出去。
