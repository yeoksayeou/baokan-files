    Have a "Real Number" in Your Heart
    Shen Cheng
    Liberation Army soldiers often say, "We must always have two cardinal numbers in our minds: 650 million and 3 billion." This means that a revolutionary must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, always cherish two peoples (the Chinese people and the people of the world) in their hearts, and never forget two revolutions (the Chinese revolution and the world revolution), and serve the Chinese and world people thoroughly and completely for a lifetime.
    A true revolutionary should not only have two "cardinal numbers" in their heart, but also a "real number," their specific service object. The two "cardinal numbers" must be implemented on a "real number."
    Comrade Jiao Yulu creatively studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, vigorously grasped the revolutionization of the county committee leadership, and armed all the people of Lankao with Mao Zedong Thought, leading them to overcome the "three harms" with their wisdom and hands, and won the victory of transforming nature. The 360,000 people of Lankao are the "real number" in Jiao Yulu's heart.
    Comrade Chen Yonggui, guided by Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of "striving for strength and self-reliance," fought fiercely against the poor mountains and bad waters together with the people of Dazhai for more than ten years, and finally created the nationally renowned Dazhai model. All the people of Dazhai are the "real number" in Chen Yonggui's heart.
    Comrade Li Suwen creatively studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works in her work as a salesperson, established the revolutionary thought of wholeheartedly serving customers, made extraordinary achievements in ordinary work, and became a role model on the national commercial front. All customers are the "real number" in her heart.
    Comrades Jiao Yulu, Chen Yonggui, and Li Suwen, because they had a "real number" in their hearts, made outstanding achievements in their respective positions and made their due contributions to the two "cardinal numbers."
    If a leading cadre does not keep the masses he leads in mind at all times, if a worker and a farmer does not keep his production tasks in mind at all times, if a soldier does not keep the important task of defending the motherland in mind at all times, and if a salesperson does not keep the customer in mind at all times, then, although these comrades are also talking about the two "cardinal numbers," in reality, they do not have the two "cardinal numbers" in their hearts.
    Closely linking the "real number" of one's work objects with the two "cardinal numbers" means that one has both the ambition of "bearing in mind the motherland and keeping the world in view," and the down-to-earth and conscientious revolutionary spirit. This is precisely the true color of our proletarian revolutionary fighters.

### 心中有个“实数”

    心中有个“实数”
    沈成
    解放军战士常说：“脑子里要经常装着两个基数：一个是六亿五，一个是三十亿。”这就是说，一个革命者，必须遵循毛泽东同志的教导，心中常怀两个人民（中国人民和世界人民），时时不忘两个革命（中国革命和世界革命），一辈子彻底地完全地为中国和世界人民服务。
    一个真正的革命者，他的胸中不仅要有两个“基数”，而且要有一个“实数”，自己的具体服务对象。两个“基数”必须落实到一个“实数”上。
    焦裕禄同志活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，狠抓县委领导革命化，并用毛泽东思想武装全体兰考人民，领导全体兰考人民用自己的智慧和双手战胜“三害”，赢来了改造大自然的胜利。三十六万兰考人民，这就是焦裕禄心中的“实数”。
    陈永贵同志以毛泽东同志提出的“奋发图强、自力更生”思想为指导，十几年如一日地同大寨人民一起，跟穷山恶水狠斗，终于创造了闻名全国的大寨典型。全体大寨人民，这就是陈永贵心中的“实数”。
    李素文同志在售货员的工作岗位上，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，树立了一心为顾客服务的革命思想，在平凡的工作中做出了不平凡的业绩，成为全国商业战线的标兵。全体顾客，这就是她心中的“实数”。
    焦裕禄、陈永贵、李素文同志，他们心中有个“实数”，就在自己的工作岗位上做出了出色的成绩，为两个“基数”作出了自己应有的贡献。
    如果一个领导干部不把自己领导的群众时时放在心上，一个工人和农民不把自己的生产任务时时放在心上，一个战士不把保卫祖国的重任时时放在心上，一个售货员不把顾客时时放在心上，那么，尽管这些同志也在谈两个“基数”，实际上恰恰是心中没有两个“基数”。
    把自己工作对象的“实数”同两个“基数”紧密地联系在一起，这就是说，既有“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的雄心壮志，又有踏踏实实、兢兢业业的革命精神。这正是我们无产阶级革命战士的本色。
