    New China News Agency, Kang Kai, 7th dispatch: The broad masses of women in the liberated areas of 川圹 (Xieng Khouang) province in Laos have made tremendous contributions in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    Recently, in the battles to counter the invasion of 富科特 (Phou Kout) Mountain - 查尔 (Jarres) Plain area by American imperialism and its running dogs, the broad masses of young women in the 川圹 area actively supported the front. Together with young men, they disregarded enemy plane bombings and artillery shelling, and continuously transported ammunition, grain, and supplies to the front lines. All young women near the battlefield were organized; some served at the front lines, some were responsible for guarding, and some persisted in production and taking care of children.

    During the battle in which the patriotic armed forces and people of 川圹 province annihilated the Thirteenth Mobile Regiment of the puppet regime at the end of last year, women in the 芒方 (Muang Phuan) and 芒安 (Muang Ang) areas organized a women's armed transport team, bravely transporting supplies to the front-line troops under the crazy bombing and sweeping of enemy planes.

    During the two 川圹 defense battles in 1963 and 1964, many women in 川圹 city and its suburbs also organized many fire line transport teams, transporting grain, ammunition, and other supplies directly to the front lines.

    On one occasion, the young women of 川圹 city, together with the local young men, climbed mountains and waded through rivers to pull a heavy artillery piece to a high ground for the combat troops. At that time, enemy planes constantly harassed and enemy artillery constantly shelled, but encouraged by the slogan "Resolutely defeat the enemy," they finally successfully pulled the artillery piece to the high ground. On another occasion, 坎菀 (Khan Van), the head of the women's association in a village, led eight heroic sisters, braving bullets and delivering grain, ammunition, and condolences to the forward positions of 普希 (Phou Xi) Mountain, the barrier of 川圹 city. When they reached a place only two hundred meters away from the enemy, the enemy suddenly began to fiercely sweep at them. They crawled forward on the mountain, persisting in delivering the supplies to the position. When the soldiers at the forward position saw them and rushed to meet them, they excitedly said to the soldiers, "You must severely strike the enemy, and we will definitely ensure that you will not lack food or ammunition." When the battle was at its fiercest, they even directly picked up the weapons they had only recently learned to use and fought alongside the soldiers to strike the enemy.

### 出入枪林弹雨　源源运送物资  老挝妇女火线运输队英勇支援前方

    出入枪林弹雨　源源运送物资
    老挝妇女火线运输队英勇支援前方
    新华社康开七日电　老挝川圹省解放区广大妇女在抗美救国的斗争中作出了巨大的贡献。
    最近在反击美帝国主义及其走狗进犯富科特山—查尔平原地区的战斗中，川圹地区广大青年妇女积极支援前线，同男青年们一起，不顾敌机轰炸和大炮的轰击，把弹药、粮食及慰劳品源源运到前方。在战地附近的青年妇女全部组织了起来，有的到前线服务，有的负责警戒，有的坚持生产和照顾儿童。
    在川圹省爱国军民去年底歼灭伪十三机动团的战斗中，芒方和芒安地区的妇女们组织了一支妇女武装运输队，在敌机疯狂轰炸扫射下，英勇地为前线部队运输物资。
    在一九六三年和一九六四年的两次川圹保卫战中，川圹市和郊区的许多妇女也组织了许多火线运输队，把粮食弹药和其它用品直接运往前沿阵地。
    有一次，川圹市的女青年同当地男青年一起，翻山涉水，为战斗部队把一门重炮拉到一个高地上去。当时，敌机不断骚扰，敌人大炮也不断轰击，但是，他们在“坚决打垮敌人”的口号的鼓舞下，终于把大炮胜利地拉上了高地。还有一次，一个村庄的女青年会负责人坎菀率领八位英雄姐妹，冒着枪林弹雨把粮弹和慰问品送到川圹市的屏障——普希山的前沿阵地。当她们到达离敌人只有二百米的地方的时候，敌人突然向她们猛动地扫射起来，她们就在山上匍匐前进，坚持把物资送上阵地。当前沿阵地上战士看到后立刻赶去迎接她们的时候，她们激动地对战士们说：“你们狠狠打击敌人，我们一定保证你们不缺粮、不缺弹。”当战斗最激烈的时候，她们还直接拿起了不久前才学会使用的武器同战士们一起打击敌人。
