    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th—U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, while testifying before the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee on the 7th, once again emphasized the "determination of the U.S. government to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons," and was greatly angered by China's position of developing nuclear weapons for self-defense.
    McNamara's testimony illustrates that the U.S. is pursuing the "prevent nuclear proliferation" fraud in order to maintain its nuclear monopoly. McNamara spoke at length about the "interests" of other countries in "preventing nuclear proliferation." But he himself admitted that "limiting nuclear weapons proliferation is most beneficial to us (the United States)." He also said, "The United States has a clear national interest in preventing (nuclear) proliferation." McNamara emphasized that the actions of non-nuclear countries to develop nuclear weapons should be "restrained," and that "a treaty against nuclear proliferation should be concluded so that signatory countries are subject to important legal, moral, and political restrictions." However, McNamara indicated that while trying to restrain other countries from developing their defense forces, the United States itself would still continue nuclear arms expansion at will. He said that every part of the U.S. plan regarding "preventing nuclear proliferation" "has military significance. Every part of this plan must be carefully considered to ensure that we take into account our overall security interests at every stage," and that the U.S. "must continue to maintain our strength and security as a solid foundation for our non-proliferation efforts."
    McNamara's testimony also shows that the U.S., like the Soviet leaders, is trying its best to promote a "prevent nuclear proliferation" agreement to pave the way for further US-Soviet cooperation. On the one hand, he stated that the U.S. would continue to strengthen the nuclear forces of the North Atlantic Group, but on the other hand, he repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. "nuclear sharing policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" "does not contradict" the so-called "prevent nuclear proliferation," and hopes that the Soviet Union "should not misunderstand our intentions."
    McNamara listed the conclusion of such a "prevent nuclear proliferation" treaty as a top priority for the United States, and wantonly slandered China. He attacked Chinese Defense Minister Lin Biao for speaking in an "aggressive manner," and described China's development of nuclear weapons to oppose U.S. nuclear blackmail as "demonstrating the aggressive intentions of Communist China." He especially made a big fuss about the fictitious so-called Chinese nuclear "threat," saying that China's development of nuclear weapons threatens "the countries around it." Then he blatantly stated that under this guise the U.S. will oppress other countries to accept U.S. nuclear protection and pull them into the U.S. nuclear strategy system. He said, "Countries bordering Communist China will need some assurance that 'protection will be given' if they give up developing nuclear weapons." He also shamelessly said that the United Nations or some other "multilateral" group should provide this "guarantee," "I think we must continue to work with other non-nuclear countries and nuclear countries to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that non-nuclear countries are protected from nuclear attacks."
    McNamara's words clearly show that the so-called "prevent nuclear proliferation" treaty is not only a major international conspiracy to "contain" China, but also a component of the U.S. strategy to further threaten, control, and aggress against so-called "countries bordering China."

    麦克纳马拉道破了“防止核扩散”骗局
    力图促成美苏核交易维护两国核垄断地位
    压别国接受美国核“保护”扩大核战略体系
    新华社八日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉七日在国会原子能委员会作证时再次强调“美国政府一定要制止核武器扩散的决心”，并且对中国为了自卫而发展核武器的立场，大为恼怒。
    麦克纳马拉的证词说明美国推行“防止核扩散”的骗局是为了维持它的核垄断地位。麦克纳马拉大谈“防止核扩散”对其他国家的“利益”。但是他自己也承认，“限制核武器扩散对我们（美国）是最有利的”。他还说，“美国在防止（核）扩散方面有明显的国家利益”。麦克纳马拉强调要使非核国家发展核武器的行动“受到克制”，要缔结“一项反对核扩散的条约使签字国受到重要的法律、道义和政治限制”。但是麦克纳马拉表明，在设法束缚其他国家发展国防力量的时候，美国自己仍将随意继续进行核扩军。他说，美国关于“防止核扩散”的“计划的每一部分都有军事意义。这个计划的每一部分都必须加以仔细的考虑以确保我们在每一阶段都考虑到我们总的安全利益”，美国“必须继续保持我们的力量和安全，作为我们进行不扩散努力的巩固的基础。”
    麦克纳马拉的证词还表明，美国和苏联领导一样，竭力想促成“防止核扩散”协议，为美苏进一步合作铺平道路。他一方面表示美国将继续加强北大西洋集团的核力量，但是又一再强调美国的关于“北大西洋公约组织的核分享政策”同所谓“防止核扩散”“并无矛盾”，并且希望苏联“不应误解我们的意图”。
    麦克纳马拉把缔结这样一项“防止核扩散”条约列为美国的首要任务，并且大肆诽谤中国。他攻击中国国防部长林彪以“咄咄逼人的方式”讲话，并且把中国为了反对美国核讹诈而发展核武器说成是“表明了共产党中国的侵略性意图”。他特别在他虚构的所谓中国核“威胁”的问题上大作文章，说什么中国发展核武器威胁到
  “在它周围的国家”。接着他露骨地说明美国将在这个幌子下压迫其他国家接受美国的核保护，把它们拉进美国的核战略体系。他说，“同共产党中国接壤的国家将需要有某种保证，即如果它们放弃搞核武器的话‘将得到保护’。”他还无耻地说，联合国或其他某些“多边”集团应当提供这种“保证”，“我认为我们必须继续努力同其他非核国家和核国家一起作出适当的安排来保证非核国家免于受到核攻击。”
    麦克纳马拉的这些话明显地说明，所谓“防止核扩散”条约，不但是“遏制”中国的国际大阴谋，而且是美国进一步威胁、控制和侵略所谓“中国接壤国家”的战略的组成部分。
