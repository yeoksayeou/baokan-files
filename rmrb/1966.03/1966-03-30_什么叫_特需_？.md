    What is "Special Procurement"?
      "Special Procurement" is the abbreviation of "Special Demand." In Japan, the US procurement of Japanese military supplies is called "Special Demand" to distinguish it from general demand.
  "Special Procurement" generally includes: 1. Procurement of military supplies and payment for labor by US troops stationed in Japan and their affiliated agencies; 2. Daily consumption of US troops stationed in Japan, officers, and their families in Japan; 3. US International Cooperation Administration's aid to Southeast Asia, purchasing general commodities and military supplies in Japan; 4. US demand for Japan in the construction of military bases in Okinawa; 5. Purchases in Japan by the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" agencies; 6. Orders placed by the United States to Japan under the Defense Production Plan and the so-called "Southeast Asia Development Plan."
      "Korean War Special Procurement" refers to the military combat materials directly purchased from Japan by the so-called UN forces during the US invasion of Korea, and the transportation, labor, and other expenses paid to Japan in US dollars. Currently, the United States is stepping up the procurement of large quantities of military combat materials, repairing aircraft and warships, and renting Japanese ships and hiring Japanese sailors to participate in military transportation in the Vietnam War. This is called "Vietnam War Special Procurement." The US Military Supply Headquarters in Japan is responsible for this "Special Procurement" order. In order to urge the implementation of this "Special Procurement" order, it has set up an office in the Mitsubishi Building in Naka-ku, Yokohama City.

### 什么叫“特需”？

专栏：名词解释

    什么叫“特需”？
      “特需”是特别需求的简称。在日本，把美国采购日本军需用品叫做“特别需求”以区别于一般的需求。
  “特需”一般包括有：一、驻日美军及其附属机关采购军需物资及支付劳役；二、驻日美军官兵及其家属在日本的日常消费；三、美国国际合作署对东南亚地区的援款，在日本采购一般商品和军需物资；四、美国建设冲绳军事基地对日本的需求；五、
  “联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”机关在日本的采购；六、美国根据国防生产计划及所谓“东南亚开发计划”对日本提出的订货。
      “朝鲜战争特需”，是美国侵朝战争期间所谓联合国军直接从日本采购的军事作战物资，和用美元向日本支付的运输、劳役及其他开支。目前美国在侵越战争中加紧向日本采购大量军事作战物资、修理飞机和军舰，并租用日本船只和雇用日本海员参加军事运输。这被叫做“越南战争特需”。负责这项
  “特需”订货的是驻日美军供应总部。为了督促这项“特需”订货的执行，它在日本横滨市中区三菱大厦内设立一个办事处。
