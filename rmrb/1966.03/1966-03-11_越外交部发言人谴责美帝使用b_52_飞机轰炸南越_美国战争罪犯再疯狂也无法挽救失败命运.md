    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 10th—The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 10th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' barbaric crimes of continuously using B-52 strategic bombers to bomb South Vietnam and slaughter peaceful residents.
    The statement pointed out that from June 18th of last year to the end of February of this year, U.S. B-52 strategic bombers carried out 185 bombing raids on South Vietnam. These U.S. aircraft have continuously and indiscriminately bombed many residential areas, slaughtering peaceful residents. It has been revealed that the United States is also planning to use more B-52 strategic bombers to further massacre the people of South Vietnam and destroy South Vietnamese villages.
    The statement said that the U.S. aggressors are using extremely barbaric war methods such as B-52 strategic bombers, chemical poisons, and poisonous gas to massacre the people of South Vietnam, attempting to salvage their defeat and predicament in South Vietnam. However, this is merely the foolish plan of the U.S. war criminals in Washington. The more frenzied and barbaric they become, the more it demonstrates their weakness, and shows that they cannot escape their fate of defeat.
    The statement said that the people of South Vietnam, with the wholehearted support of more than 17 million compatriots in the North and the deep sympathy of the people of all countries, are determined to smash all the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism.
    The statement said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demands that the U.S. government must immediately stop using B-52 strategic bombers to bomb South Vietnam. The U.S. government must stop its war of aggression against South Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. troops and its puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and must stop the bombing, strafing, and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    越外交部发言人谴责美帝使用B—52飞机轰炸南越
    美国战争罪犯再疯狂也无法挽救失败命运
    新华社河内十日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人十日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义不断使用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸越南南方屠杀和平居民的野蛮罪行。
    声明指出从去年六月十八日到今年二月底，美国的B—52型战略轰炸机对越南南方进行了一百八十五次的轰炸，这些美国飞机不断滥肆轰炸许多居民区，屠杀和平居民。据透露，美国还正在计划使用更多的B—52型战略轰炸机来进一步屠杀越南南方人民，摧毁越南南方的村庄。
    声明说，美国侵略者使用B—52型战略轰炸机以及使用化学毒药和毒气等极端野蛮的战争手段，来屠杀越南南方人民，妄图挽救自己在越南南方的败局和困境。但是，这只不过是华盛顿的美国战争罪犯们的愚蠢打算而已。它们越疯狂、越野蛮，就越表明它们的软弱，表明它们无法摆脱失败的命运。
    声明说，越南南方人民在一千七百多万北方同胞的全心全意的支持下，在各国人民的深切同情下，决心粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部坚决要求美国政府必须立即停止使用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸越南南方。美国政府必须停止对越南南方的侵略战争，把美军和它的仆从军和武器全部从越南南方撤走，必须停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其他的一切战争行动。
