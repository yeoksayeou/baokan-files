    Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, March 25th -- The U.S. "Special Committee to Strive for the Establishment of a Marxist-Leninist Party" published an article in the March issue of its "Special Committee Bulletin" in Chicago, pointing out that while U.S. imperialism is pursuing a global aggression policy and brutally invading Vietnam, Soviet modern revisionism is stepping up its cooperation with the United States in engaging in "peace talk" conspiracies and "parallel actions." Its purpose is to cooperate with U.S. imperialism in suppressing the world people's struggle against imperialism and for national liberation, and to serve the U.S. imperialist global strategy of "containing China." All Marxist-Leninists should draw a clear line with modern revisionists.
    The article said that since defeating fascism twenty years ago, U.S. imperialism has played the role of the world's number one oppressor. Imperialism's dual tactics, namely talking about "peace" on the one hand and waging war on the other, have become very clear to many Marxist-Leninists.
    To satisfy the interests of sixty U.S. billionaire families, Johnson is today waging a barbaric, genocidal war against the people of Southeast Asia.
    Millions upon millions of people across the United States are gradually awakening to the unjust and inhumane policies pursued by U.S. imperialism. They are expressing their opinions through direct mass actions and various forms of struggle. This growing resentment towards Johnson's war policies among all sectors of American society has deeply disturbed the government. Therefore, Johnson has launched a "peace offensive" in an attempt to appease the people.
    Developments over the past year have awakened millions to the fact that the central aim of U.S. imperialism's foreign policy is to destroy any nation and any government that desires freedom and refuses to submit and reject the dictates of Chairman Johnson, the imperialist. The international revisionists are despicable accomplices in the diplomatic conspiracies perpetrated by U.S. imperialism.
    The article pointed out that the struggle of Vietnam against U.S. imperialism is the focal point of the global struggle against imperialism. The heroic Vietnamese people are today standing on the front line against the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism. They have received material support from China, and they have also received the moral and spiritual support of the overwhelming majority of people around the world.
    However, the Brezhnev-Kosygin group, which possesses sufficient naval and air power to oppose and stop the massacre in Vietnam, is only willing to provide symbolic military assistance to disguise the essence of their role, which is to cooperate with imperialism in the diplomatic field to "stabilize" the world and suppress the world's people's movement for liberation and national salvation.
    The article said that in the past few months, the Soviet Union has engaged in a flurry of intense diplomatic activity from the United Nations to Ulaanbaatar. Its aim is clearly to impose a sham peace conference on the Vietnamese people, to ensure that U.S. imperialism stays put in Southeast Asia, to stop the national liberation movement in the Third World, and to complete the northern union of the pincer encirclement that the United States and the Soviet Union have formed around China. This encirclement starts from India in the west and extends to Japan in the east.
    Over the past year, Khrushchev's successors have unusually shown particular friendliness to the reactionary Japanese Sato government. They have turned a blind eye to the Japan-South Korea treaty, which is an instrument of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China, and is clearly a sign of the revival of Japanese militarism under the protection of U.S. imperialism.
    The Soviet leaders praise the Sato government as a "stabilizing force in Asia" and as "holding a leading position in Asia," and demand that the Soviet Union and Japanese reactionaries cooperate closely in international affairs.
    Gromyko recently said that the development of friendly relations between the Soviet government and the Sato regime would not harm Japan's relations with "third countries" (the United States). These remarks clearly indicate that the path of U.S.-Soviet cooperation has found a new avenue in the Far East through the Japanese reactionaries.
    The article said that last December, the Kosygin-Brezhnev group announced a three-pronged diplomatic offensive. Kosygin went to Tashkent, Shelepin went to Hanoi, and Brezhnev went to Ulaanbaatar.
    The article said that Kosygin's methods in Tashkent were obvious to the world. It is part of the overall plan of "parallel actions" in service of U.S. imperialism. No sooner had the ink dried on the India-Pakistan agreement than the Soviet leaders immediately hailed it as the "Spirit of Tashkent." Strategically, the purpose of this action is to promote their overall line of "peaceful coexistence" and to undermine and weaken the united struggle against U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. This agreement also serves the U.S. imperialist global strategy of containing and isolating China.
    The Soviet press vigorously promotes the "Spirit of Tashkent," calls for the resolution of differences through negotiations, and propagates the Tashkent agreement far beyond the Indian subcontinent. They even declare that the India-Pakistan agreement is very important for the entire Southeast Asia. In this way, the Soviet leaders once again implicitly ask the Vietnamese people to sit at a conference table with Johnson and hand over their motherland to the world's oppressors.
    U.S. imperialism talks about "peace" while intensifying the brutal slaughter of the Vietnamese people. Yet the Brezhnev-Kosygin group is stepping up its cooperation with U.S. imperialism in the diplomatic field to stop the national liberation war and strategically "contain" China.
    While the Soviet Union is pursuing these tactics, we hear angry words from Soviet leaders against U.S. aggression. But as Marxist-Leninists, we must grasp the essence behind the façade of this revisionist group that demands the unity of the socialist world. This group "condemns" U.S. imperialism with "harsh" words, but at the same time, it is conspiring with the same U.S. imperialism to dominate the world.
    The article concludes by saying that the Special Committee calls on all Marxist-Leninists to draw a clear line with international revisionism, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely carry out the struggle against reaction, for peace, liberation, and the gradual victory of the world proletarian movement. This victory will create a new era without oppression and exploitation.

### 美国“争取成立马列主义党特别委员会”指出  苏联领导人为美帝全球侵略战略效劳  马列主义者应同修正主义者划清界线

    美国“争取成立马列主义党特别委员会”指出
    苏联领导人为美帝全球侵略战略效劳
    马列主义者应同修正主义者划清界线
    新华社二十五日讯　芝加哥消息：美国“争取成立马列主义党特别委员会”三月份在芝加哥出版的《特别委员会公报》上发表一篇文章指出：当美帝国主义正在推行全球侵略政策，残酷地侵略越南的时候，苏联现代修正主义加紧同美国合作搞“和谈”阴谋，搞“并行不悖的行动”，其目的是配合美帝国主义压制世界人民的反对帝国主义和争取民族解放的斗争，并为美帝国主义“遏制中国”的全球战略效劳。所有马克思列宁主义者应该同现代修正主义者划清界线。
    文章说，自从在二十年前打败法西斯主义之后，美国帝国主义扮演起世界头号压迫者的角色以来，帝国主义的双重战术，即一边谈论“和平”，一边进行战争，对许多马克思列宁主义者来说已经十分清楚。
    为了满足美国六十个拥有成十亿美元财产的富翁家族的利益，约翰逊今天正在对东南亚人民进行一场野蛮的、灭绝种族的战争。
    美国各地千千万万人民逐步地醒悟到美国帝国主义所奉行的不义的、反人道的政策。他们正在通过直接的大规模活动和通过采取多种形式的斗争表示他们的意见。美国社会各阶层对约翰逊的战争政策所表示的这种越来越大的愤慨，使政府深深感到不安，因此约翰逊发动了“和平攻势”，企图以此来安抚人民。
    一年来的局势发展已使千百万人醒悟到这样的事实，即美国帝国主义对外政策的中心目的是毁灭要自由而不肯屈服和拒绝屈从帝国主义的董事长约翰逊的指挥棒的任何民族和任何政府。可恶的是国际修正主义者充当美国帝国主义帮凶在外交上所玩弄的阴谋。
    文章指出，越南反对美帝国主义的斗争是全世界反对帝国主义斗争的焦点。英雄的越南人民今天正站在反对美帝国主义的野蛮侵略的前线。他们得到了中国的物质支援，他们还得到了全世界压倒多数的人们的道义和精神上的支持。
    但是，拥有足够的海空力量来反对并制止对越南的屠杀的勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团，却只愿给予象征性军事援助来掩饰他们所扮演的角色的本质，那就是在外交领域中同帝国主义合作来“稳定”世界，压制全世界人民争取解放和救国的运动。
    文章说，过去几个月中，苏联从联合国到乌兰巴托进行了一阵紧张的外交活动，其目的显然是要把一个假和平会议强加于越南人民、保证美帝国主义赖在东南亚、制止第三世界的民族解放运动，并且完成苏美在中国周围结成的钳形包围圈的北部联合，这个包围圈西面从印度开始，东面到日本为止。
    过去一年中，赫鲁晓夫的继承者一反寻常，向日本佐藤政府反动派表示特别友好。他们对日韩条约装作没有看见，这个条约是一项针对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国的侵略工具，而且显然是日本军国主义在美帝国主义庇护下复活的一个迹象。
    苏联领导人赞扬佐藤政府是“亚洲的稳定力量”、“在亚洲居领导地位”，并且要求苏联和日本反动派在国际事务中密切配合。
    葛罗米柯最近说，发展苏联政府和佐藤政权之间的友好关系不会损害日本同“第三国”（美国）的关系。这番话清楚地指出了，苏美合作的道路已经在远东通过日本反动派找到一个新的途径。
    文章说，去年十二月，柯西金—勃列日涅夫集团宣布了三路并进的外交攻势。柯西金去塔什干，谢列平去河内，勃列日涅夫去乌兰巴托。
    文章说，柯西金在塔什干的手法是全世界有目共睹的。它是为美帝国主义效劳的“并行不悖的行动”总计划的一部分。印巴协议墨迹未干，苏联领导人就立刻把它歌颂为“塔什干精神”。从策略上说，这一行动的目的是要宣传他们的“和平共处”总路线，以及破坏和削弱东南亚和其它地方反对美帝国主义的联合斗争。这项协议也是为美帝国主义的遏制和孤立中国的全球战略效劳的。
    苏联报刊大肆宣扬“塔什干精神”，要求通过谈判解决分歧，宣传塔什干协议远超出印度次大陆的范围，它们甚至宣布，印巴协议对整个东南亚都是非常重要的。这样，苏联领导人再度含蓄地要越南人民同约翰逊坐在一张会议桌旁，把自己的祖国拱手让给世界压迫者。
    美帝国主义口头讲“和平”，而在同时加紧残暴屠杀越南人民，可是勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团却在外交方面同美帝国主义加紧合作以制止民族解放战争，并在战略上“遏制”中国。
    在苏联推行这些手法的时候，我们听到苏联领导反对美国侵略的愤怒言词。但是我们作为马克思列宁主义者，必须抓住那个要求社会主义世界团结的修正主义集团外表后面的实质。这个集团以“严厉”的言词“谴责”美帝国主义，但在同时却跟同一个美帝国主义进行着统治世界的阴谋。
    文章最后说，特别委员会号召全体马克思列宁主义者同国际修正主义划清界线，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，坚决进行反对反动、争取和平、解放和世界无产阶级运动逐步取胜的斗争，这个胜利将创造一个没有压迫和剥削的新时代。
