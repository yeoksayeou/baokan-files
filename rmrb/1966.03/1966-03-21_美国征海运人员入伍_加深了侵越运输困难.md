    US Recruitment of Maritime Personnel
    Worsens Transportation Difficulties for Aggression Against Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: The United States' recruitment of maritime personnel into the army to alleviate the depletion of troops has resulted in a severe shortage of maritime personnel, exacerbating the difficulties in supplying war materials for the aggression against Vietnam.
    Fleming, the Pacific Coast Director of the US Maritime Administration, said on the 3rd that the shortage of US maritime personnel "is worsening due to the conscription of licensed deck and engineering officers into the armed forces." He also said that this "shortage has reached a critical level," causing "ships carrying vital cargo" for US troops in Vietnam "to be delayed as a result."
    Fleming has written to the draft board expressing his hope that it will "carefully consider reclassifying the service ranks of licensed commercial maritime personnel."
    Concurrently with the shortage of maritime personnel, there is also a shortage of military supplies used for the war of aggression against Vietnam. A US Department of Defense spokesman confirmed on the 4th that the US government is buying back some surplus military supplies previously sold by the United States from its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. According to Western news agencies, these supplies are intended for use in Vietnam and include five-hundred-pound bombs for US B-52 bombers. News reports say that the US has spent about $240,000 to buy back 6,000 fragmentation bombs from West Germany.

### 美国征海运人员入伍  加深了侵越运输困难

    美国征海运人员入伍
    加深了侵越运输困难
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国征召海运人员入伍当兵以缓和兵源枯竭，结果却使海运人员严重缺乏，而加深了侵越战争物资供应的困难。
    美国海事局太平洋沿岸负责人弗莱明三日说，美国海运人员不足的情况“由于把领有执照的甲板人员和机械人员征入武装部队而正在恶化”。他还说，这种“不足的情况已经达到了严重的程度”，以致为美国在越南的部队“运载重要货物的船只都因此而迟到”。
    弗莱明已经写信给征兵局，表示希望它“仔细考虑重新划分领有执照的商业海运人员的服役等级”。
    在海运人员不足的同时，供侵越战争使用的军事物资也感到缺乏。美国国防部发言人四日证实，美国政府正在从北大西洋集团的盟国那里买回过去美国售出的某些剩余军事物资。据西方通讯社透露，这些物资是用于越南的，其中包括美国B—52轰炸机用的五百磅炸弹。有消息说，美国已经花了大约二十四万美元从西德买回了六千个杀伤炸弹。
