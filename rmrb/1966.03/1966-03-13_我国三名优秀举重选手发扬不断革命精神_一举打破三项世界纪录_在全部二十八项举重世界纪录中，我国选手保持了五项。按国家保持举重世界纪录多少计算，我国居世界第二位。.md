    Our Three Excellent Weightlifters Display the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
    Breaking Three World Records
    Of all twenty-eight world records in weightlifting, Chinese athletes hold five. Ranked by the number of world records held, China is second in the world.
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 12) Inspired by the spirit of continuous revolution, outstanding Chinese weightlifters broke three world records and eight national records in Beijing tonight. With this achievement, Chinese athletes now hold five of the twenty-eight world records in weightlifting. Ranked by the number of world records held, China has surpassed Hungary, Japan, and Poland to take second place in the world.
    The three new world records tonight were all set in the featherweight class. They are: Chen Manlin from Guangdong, with a press of 128.5 kg, broke the world record of 128 kg held by Foldi of Hungary; Xiao Mingxiang from Guangxi, with a snatch of 124 kg, broke the world record of 123.5 kg held by Yoshinobu Miyake of Japan; Ji Fayuan from Hubei, with a clean and jerk of 153.5 kg, broke the world record of 153 kg held by Xiao Mingxiang. Among these, the world records for the featherweight press and snatch were broken by Chinese athletes for the first time.
    Ji Fayuan, 27, who broke a world record for the first time, excitedly told Xinhua reporters that today was the eighth time since 1962 that he had "attacked" the world record for the featherweight clean and jerk. Before the competition, by studying Chairman Mao's works, he focused on resolving the "fear" that had developed due to the previous seven failures, strengthened his confidence, and resolved to demonstrate a brave and tenacious spirit in the competition and once again attack the world record. As a result, he finally realized his desire to win glory for the motherland. He said that he has not done enough and that in the future, he will work with his comrades to attack the world record for the featherweight total.
    In the 1966 eight-unit weightlifting competition held at the Beijing Gymnasium tonight, athletes from various regions strived to be the best, and their results were generally significantly improved compared to when they participated in the Second National Games last year.
    In the featherweight competition, Chen Manlin, 24, first broke the national record of 123 kg for the press held by Ji Fayuan with a score of 123.5 kg. Then, he pressed 128.5 kg, breaking the world record that had been held by a Hungarian athlete for many years. Chen Manlin's snatch score tonight was 105 kg, and his clean and jerk was 142.5 kg, with a total of 375 kg for the three lifts.
    Xiao Mingxiang, 26, broke a world record for the second time tonight, following his breaking of the world record for the featherweight clean and jerk last year. He is the first Chinese athlete to break two single-lift world records. His total score reached 380 kg, breaking the national record and surpassing Chen Manlin's new score of 375 kg. His press and clean and jerk scores tonight were 115 kg and 147.5 kg, respectively.
    Ji Fayuan also attempted to break the world record in the featherweight press tonight, but he was not successful. However, he was not discouraged, especially inspired by Chen Manlin and Xiao Mingxiang's breaking of world records, he resolved to attack the world record again in the clean and jerk. After he successfully lifted 153.5 kg in the clean and jerk, his total score reached 385 kg, creating the highest national score. His press and snatch scores were 122.5 kg and 110 kg, respectively.
    To date, since 1956, nine Chinese weightlifters have broken world records twenty-five times.
    In tonight's competition, four other athletes broke four national records.

    我国三名优秀举重选手发扬不断革命精神
    一举打破三项世界纪录
    在全部二十八项举重世界纪录中，我国选手保持了五项。按国家保持举重世界纪录多少计算，我国居世界第二位。
    据新华社十二日讯　我国优秀举重选手发扬不断革命精神，今晚在北京一举打破了三项世界纪录和八项全国纪录。至此，在全部二十八项举重世界纪录中，我国选手已经保持了五项，按国家保持举重世界纪录的多少计算，超过了匈牙利、日本和波兰而跃居世界第二位。
    今晚的三项世界新纪录，都是在次轻量级比赛中创造的。这三项是：广东选手陈满林以一二八·五公斤的成绩，打破了匈牙利选手福尔迪保持的推举一二八公斤的世界纪录；广西选手萧明祥以一二四公斤的成绩，打破了日本选手三宅义信保持的抓举一二三·五公斤的世界纪录；湖北选手季发元以一五三·五公斤的成绩，打破了萧明祥保持的挺举一五三公斤的世界纪录。其中次轻量级推举和抓举世界纪录，都是第一次被我国选手所打破。
    第一次打破世界纪录的二十七岁的季发元兴奋地对新华社记者说，今天是他从一九六二年以来第八次“冲击”次轻量级挺举的世界纪录。在比赛前，他通过学习毛主席著作，着重解决了由于前七次失败而一度产生的“怕”的思想，增强了信心，决心在比赛中发扬勇敢顽强精神，再次向世界纪录冲击，结果终于实现了为祖国争光的愿望。他说，他做得还很不够，今后还要同战友们一起冲击次轻量级举重总成绩的世界纪录。
    今晚在北京体育馆举行的一九六六年八单位举重比赛，各地选手力争上游，成绩大都比去年参加第二届全国运动会时有了比较大幅度的提高。
    在次轻量级比赛中，二十四岁的陈满林首先以一二三·五公斤的成绩，打破了季发元保持的推举一二三公斤的全国纪录。接着又推举起了一二八·五公斤，打破了多年来一直由匈牙利选手保持的世界纪录。陈满林今晚抓举成绩是一○五公斤、挺举是一四二·五公斤，三个单项的总成绩达到了三七五公斤。
    二十六岁的萧明祥今晚是继去年打破次轻量级挺举世界纪录以后，第二次打破世界纪录。他是我国第一个一个人打破两个单项举重世界纪录的选手。他的总成绩达到了三八○公斤。不仅打破了全国纪录，同时超过了陈满林的三七五公斤的新成绩。他今晚的推举和挺举成绩是一一五公斤和一四七·五公斤。
    季发元今晚在次轻量级推举中也曾经冲击世界纪录，可是没有成功。然而他并不气馁，特别是他受到陈满林和萧明祥打破世界纪录的鼓舞，决心在挺举中再次冲击世界纪录。他挺举一五三·五公斤成功以后，总成绩达到了三八五公斤，创造了全国最高成绩。他推举和抓举成绩分别是一二二·五公斤和一一○公斤。
    至此，从一九五六年以来，我国已经有九名举重选手二十五次打破世界纪录。
    在今晚的比赛中，还有四名选手打破了四项全国纪录。
