    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – The Japanese Sato government, following the will of the United States, openly advocates fixing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which sells out the interests of the Japanese nation and threatens Asian peace, for a long time. This is done in order to continue to accelerate the revival of militarism and closely cooperate with U.S. imperialism in expanding its war of aggression against Asia.
    It is reported that Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato publicly advocated in the Senate Budget Committee on the 8th that the validity of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should be extended after it expires in 1970.
    He said: "Although the international situation has changed compared with the time when the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' was concluded, it has not lost the necessity of its existence," so "we should stand on a long-term perspective and allow the Japan-U.S. 'Security Guarantee System' to continue to exist."
    At the same meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina said: The continued existence of the Japan-U.S. "Security Guarantee System" is exerting its power. In his speech, Shiina opposed the claim by some members of the Liberal Democratic Party to change the "permanent stationing" of American troops in Japan stipulated in the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to "stationing in Japan in case of emergency." He said: "The long-term stationing (of U.S. troops) in Japan is very important."
    The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, *Akahata*, pointed out in its report on the 9th that Sato and Shiina's statement, combined with their recent repeated emphasis on Japan's obligation to fulfill the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the assertion that "the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty has nuclear retaliatory power," shows that the Sato government, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, is attempting to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. "Security Guarantee System" in order to follow the United States in its aggression against Asia in the long term and in an all-round way.
    *Akahata* also revealed that the Sato government and the U.S. government are conducting secret negotiations on extending the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" for ten years.
    The Japanese bourgeois newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* also pointed out that the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's public advocacy that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will exist for a long time shows that the Japanese government has taken a big step forward on this issue.
    It is reported that recently, within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with the "Security Guarantee Investigation Committee" as the core, frequent discussions have been held on how to strengthen the Japan-U.S. "Security Guarantee System." Extreme right-wing leader and war criminal Kaya Okinori believes that "in order to stably maintain Japan's security system, it is necessary to extend the validity of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' for another ten years after 1970."
    In order to continue to extend the Japan-U.S. security guarantee system and further revive militarism, the Japanese reactionaries have recently used a group of reactionary politicians and scribes to issue a wave of militaristic clamor through television, radio, and newspapers.

    日本反动派甘心长期充当美帝侵略亚洲的帮凶
    佐藤公然主张延长日美条约期限
    据新华社东京九日电  日本佐藤政府秉承美国的意旨，公开主张要把出卖日本民族利益、威胁亚洲和平的日美“安全条约”长期固定下来，以便继续加速复活军国主义，紧密配合美帝国主义扩大侵略亚洲的战争。
    据报道，日本首相佐藤荣作八日在参议院预算委员会上，公开主张要在日美“安全条约”到一九七○年期满后，把这一条约的有效期限继续延长下去。
    他说：“国际形势虽然同缔结日美‘安全条约’当时比较，有了变化，但是并没有失去这一条约存在的必要性”，因此“应当站在长远的观点上，使日美‘安全保障体制’继续存在下去。”
    在同一个会议上，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎说：日美“安全保障体制”的继续存在，发挥着它的威力。椎名在发言中反对自由民主党内一部分人要求把日美“安全条约”所规定的美国军队“常驻”日本改为“有事时驻留”日本的主张，他说：“（美军）在日本长期驻留是非常重要的”。
    日共中央机关报《赤旗报》在九日的报道中指出，佐藤和椎名的这一发言同他们最近一再强调日本应当履行日美“安全条约”的义务、“日美安全条约具有核报复力”的叫嚷联系起来，表明佐藤政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，正在企图进一步加强日美“安全保障体制”，以便长期地、全面地追随美国侵略亚洲。
    《赤旗报》还揭露，佐藤政府和美国政府正在就把日美
  “安全条约”延长十年的问题进行秘密谈判。
    日本资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》也指出，日本首相和外务大臣公开主张日美“安全条约”将长期存在下去，这表明日本政府在这个问题上又向前迈进了一大步。
    据报道，最近在执政的自由民主党内，以“安全保障调查会”为核心，就如何加强日美“安全保障体制”的问题，进行了频繁的讨论。极右派头目战犯贺屋兴宣认为，“为了稳定地维持日本的安全体制，有必要从一九七○年以后把日美‘安全条约’的有效期限再延长十年。”
    日本反动派为了给继续延长日美安全保障体制，进一步复活军国主义，最近曾利用一批反动政客和御用文人，通过电视、广播、报刊发出一片鼓吹军国主义的叫嚣。
