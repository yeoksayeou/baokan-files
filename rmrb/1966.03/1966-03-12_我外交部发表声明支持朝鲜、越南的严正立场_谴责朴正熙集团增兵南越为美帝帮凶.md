    Our Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Supporting North Korea and Vietnam's Solemn Stance
    Condemns Park Chung-hee Group for Sending Troops to South Vietnam as Accomplices of U.S. Imperialism
    Whether U.S. imperialism comes out itself or drives more lackeys into battle, it cannot save its inevitable fate of failure. The Park Chung-hee group wholeheartedly sells its life for its master, and in the end, it can only accelerate its own demise.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 11th - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on March 11th, condemning the South Korean Park Chung-hee group for deciding, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, to send another 20,000 puppet troops to South Vietnam to participate in the U.S. war of aggression, and expressing firm support for the solemn stance taken by the Korean and Vietnamese people on this issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                      March 11, 1966
    Recently, the South Korean Park Chung-hee group, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, decided to send another 20,000 puppet troops to South Vietnam to participate in the U.S. war of aggression. This is another serious step by U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam by using its running dogs. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front have respectively issued statements strongly condemning this new crime of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly support the solemn stance of the Korean and Vietnamese people.
    U.S. imperialism has already fallen into a quagmire in its war of aggression against Vietnam. Its policies of war blackmail and peace talk deception have been repeatedly frustrated. It has sent more than 200,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam, but it has not been able to change the situation of being passively beaten. Under the resolute attacks of the heroic Vietnamese people, the U.S. aggressor troops have suffered heavy casualties, causing great shock and controversy within the United States.
    In order to solve the contradiction between expanding the war and the shortage of manpower, the Johnson administration, after the Honolulu Conference, intensified its activities to collect cannon fodder. U.S. Vice President Humphrey personally ran to South Korea and vassal states such as the Philippines, New Zealand, and Australia, using threats and bribes to force them to sell their lives for the U.S. policy of aggression and provide manpower for the U.S. war of aggression against South Vietnam. The Park Chung-hee group is willing to betray the interests of the Korean nation, take the lead in responding to U.S. demands, and faithfully implement the orders of its U.S. master by sending more puppet troops to South Vietnam. This crime will surely be severely punished by the Korean and Vietnamese people.
    The U.S. imperialist plan to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam is not only aimed at the Vietnamese and Korean people, but also at the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. Since U.S. imperialism has increasingly closely linked its front of aggression against the people of Asian countries, the Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese people and the people of Asian countries standing on the front line against U.S. aggression have no choice but to further unite, support each other, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.
    The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their heroic struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. Whether U.S. imperialism comes out itself or drives more lackeys into battle, it cannot save its inevitable fate of failure. The Park Chung-hee group wholeheartedly sells its life for its master, and in the end, it can only accelerate its own demise.

    我外交部发表声明支持朝鲜、越南的严正立场
    谴责朴正熙集团增兵南越为美帝帮凶
    不论美帝亲自出马也好，驱使更多的仆从上阵也好，都不能挽救它必然失败的命运。朴正熙集团死心塌地为它的主子卖命，到头来只能加速它自己的死亡。
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十一日发表声明，谴责南朝鲜朴正熙集团在美帝国主义的指使下，决定再派两万名伪军去越南南方参加美国的侵略战争，并且表示坚决支持朝鲜人民和越南人民对这个问题所采取的严正立场。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                      一九六六年三月十一日
    最近，南朝鲜朴正熙集团在美帝国主义的指使下，决定再派两万名伪军去越南南方参加美国的侵略战争。这是美帝国主义利用它的走狗在越南扩大侵略战争的又一严重步骤。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、越南民主共和国外交部和越南南方民族解放阵线分别发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的这一新的罪行。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和越南人民的严正立场。
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中，已经陷入不能自拔的困境。它的战争讹诈政策和和谈欺骗阴谋接连遭到挫败。它向南越派遣了二十多万美军，并没有能够改变被动挨打的局面。在英雄的越南人民的坚决打击下，美国侵略军死伤惨重，引起了美国国内很大的震动和争吵。
    为了解决扩大战争和兵源不足的矛盾，约翰逊政府在檀香山会议之后，加紧进行了搜罗炮灰的活动。美国副总统汉弗莱亲自跑到南朝鲜和菲律宾、新西兰、澳大利亚等仆从国家，用威胁、收买的手段，要它们为美国的侵略政策卖命，替美国侵略南越战争提供人力。朴正熙集团竟然甘心出卖朝鲜民族利益，带头响应美国的要求，忠实执行美国主子的命令，向南越增派伪军，他这种罪行必将受到朝鲜人民和越南人民严厉的惩罚。
    美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的计划，不仅是针对着越南人民和朝鲜人民，也是针对着中国人民和亚洲各国人民的。美帝国主义既然把它侵略亚洲各国人民的战线日益紧密地联系在一起，站在反美侵略前线的越南人民、朝鲜人民、中国人民和亚洲各国人民除掉进一步团结起来、互相支援、彻底打败美国侵略者而外，没有别的选择。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的英勇斗争进行到底。不论美帝国主义亲自出马也好，驱使更多的仆从上阵也好，都不能挽救它必然失败的命运。朴正熙集团死心塌地为它的主子卖命，到头来只能加速它自己的死亡。
