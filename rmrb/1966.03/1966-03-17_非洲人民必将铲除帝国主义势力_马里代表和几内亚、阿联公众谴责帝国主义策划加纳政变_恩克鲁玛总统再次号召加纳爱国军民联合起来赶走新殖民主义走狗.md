    The People of Africa Will Surely Eradicate Imperialist Forces
    Malian Representative and Public Figures in Guinea and the UAR Condemn Imperialist Plotting of the Coup in Ghana
    President Nkrumah Reiterates Call for Patriotic Soldiers and Civilians in Ghana to Unite and Drive Away the Lackeys of Neocolonialism
    Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, March 15th. Malian Minister-Delegate for Foreign Affairs, Ousman Ba, gave a statement to the press here on the morning of the 15th, condemning the subversive plots of imperialism and calling on the people of all African nations to rise up against imperialism and neocolonialism.
    In his statement, Ousman Ba reiterated Mali's full and unwavering support for President Nkrumah. He expressed his firm belief that the people of Ghana are capable of shouldering the responsibility of restoring the rule of law in Ghana.
    He said that imperialism is launching an offensive against all our African countries, and we must engage in a decisive battle against the conspiracies of imperialism and neocolonialism, who are attempting to endanger our young independent nations, whose economies are still not consolidated. We are filled with confidence in the decisive struggle of the people of all African nations against imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 14th. The Guinean government's firm opposition to the imperialist plotting of the coup in Ghana and its active support for President Nkrumah have received widespread support both domestically and abroad.
    According to Guinean radio reports, in recent days, President Sékou Touré has continually received a large number of telegrams from regional and grassroots committees of the Democratic Party of Guinea, nationalist parties from various African countries, mass organizations, African students in the United States, Britain, and Canada, Guinean expatriates overseas, and African-American students, expressing their support. These telegrams unanimously condemned the imperialist plotting of the military coup in Ghana, expressed support for President Nkrumah, and firmly supported the correct stance taken by the Guinean government regarding the events in Ghana.
    The Second District Committee of the Democratic Party of Guinea in Conakry, in a telegram to the National Political Bureau of the Democratic Party on the 13th, expressed its support for the clear and resolute stance taken by the National Political Bureau on the events in Ghana, and unreservedly endorsed the specific measures decided upon by the national leadership of the Democratic Party of Guinea.
    The Guinean Democratic Party's official newspaper, *Liberté*, published an article on the 11th, stating that the imperialist massacres of our people are digging their own graves and are prompting a new revolutionary storm to brew on the African continent. The article stated that the liberation wars of the people of all countries will surely eliminate and eradicate imperialism and old and new colonialism from the Earth.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 16th. According to reports in local newspapers on the 16th, the United Arab Republic Labor Federation issued a statement after concluding a three-day cultural conference on the 15th, condemning the military coup in Ghana as an imperialist conspiracy in Ghana and expressing support for the Ghanaian workers.
    The statement pointed out that imperialism and reactionaries are plotting conspiracies in Africa with the aim of exerting pressure on the national liberation movement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 14th. President Nkrumah, through Guinean radio, once again addressed the people of Ghana on the evening of the 13th, calling on the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Ghana to unite and "drive away the lackeys of neocolonialism, drive away imperialism."
    He said: "I call on members of the Convention People's Party, those warriors who so bravely defeated the colonialists before independence, I call on the Farmers' Cooperative Council, the Ghana National Women's Council, the Ghana Muslim Council, the Workers' Brigade, all party organizations and activists in the nine regions of Ghana, and, last but not least, the Young Pioneers Movement and all Ghanaian youth, to stand firm in this hour of trial, reject all hypocrisy and deceit, and prepare to rise up against this group of tyrannical and deceitful adventurers. I also call on loyal members of my armed forces and police to unite with the masses, stand by their side and fight, and eliminate these rebellious traitors and lackeys of colonialism."
    President Nkrumah pointed out that the so-called "National Liberation Council" established by the Ghanaian rebels is not a "new government of Ghana," but "merely a gang of military and police adventurers who are attempting to destroy and thwart the economic, political, and social achievements of the Ghanaian people. They are carrying out this heinous scheme at the behest of neocolonialists and their agents. Neocolonialists and their agents have used violence to keep the Ghanaian people in a state of oppression. But they will surely fail."
    He said: Imperialists and neocolonialists "have only succeeded in aiding and abetting mad executioners who coldly slaughter patriotic citizens and those who kill loyal and innocent officers. Neocolonialism's position in Africa has been challenged by us, and it will soon collapse. The anarchy and atmosphere of terror that these rebels and traitors are attempting to establish in Ghana will not last long."
    Nkrumah said, "I know that most of the military and police do not support this rebel group." "Even if they are now misguided, intimidated, or threatened, they will still rise up with the people to defend the people's cause."
    Nkrumah pointed out that since the events of February 24th, "imperialists, neocolonialists, and their agents have poured into Ghana, pouring into this country because they smell fertile ground for economic enslavement and profiteering. This group of traitors and rebels have done much to prepare this land for them to come to Ghana."
    Nkrumah emphasized: "The Ghanaian masses, who defeated colonialism, will also defeat neocolonialism and their agents in Ghana."
    He concluded: "I will personally stay with you, and when the time comes, you will surely see this."

    非洲人民必将铲除帝国主义势力
    马里代表和几内亚、阿联公众谴责帝国主义策划加纳政变
    恩克鲁玛总统再次号召加纳爱国军民联合起来赶走新殖民主义走狗
    新华社巴马科十五日电　马里外交事务部长级代表乌斯曼·巴十五日上午在这里对报界发表谈话，谴责帝国主义的颠覆阴谋，呼吁非洲各国人民起来反对帝国主义和新殖民主义。
    乌斯曼·巴在谈话中重申马里完全和坚决支持恩克鲁玛总统。他表示深信，加纳人民能够负起在加纳恢复法制的责任。
    他说，帝国主义针对我们所有非洲国家发动攻势，我们必须同帝国主义和新殖民主义的阴谋进行决定性的战斗，他们企图把我们经济仍然不巩固的年轻独立国家置于危险境地。我们对非洲各国人民反对帝国主义的决定性斗争是满怀信心的。
    据新华社科纳克里十四日电　几内亚政府坚决反对帝国主义在加纳策划政变和积极支持恩克鲁玛总统的立场，得到了国内外的广泛支持。
    据几内亚电台报道，最近几天，塞古·杜尔总统不断收到几内亚民主党地区委员会和基层委员会、非洲国家各民族主义政党、群众团体、在美国和英国以及加拿大的非洲学生、海外的几内亚侨民以及美国黑人学生拍来的表示支持的大量电报。这些电报一致谴责帝国主义策划加纳的军事政变，表示支持恩克鲁玛总统并且坚决支持几内亚政府对加纳事件所采取的正确立场。
    几内亚民主党科纳克里第二区委员会，十三日在给民主党全国政治局的电报中表示，支持全国政治局对加纳事件采取的明确而果敢的立场，并且无保留地拥护几内亚民主党全国领导机构所决定的具体措施。
    几内亚民主党机关报《自由报》十一日发表文章说，帝国主义屠杀我们各国人民，正是在为自己挖掘坟墓，是促使在非洲大陆上酝酿一场新的革命风暴。文章说，各国人民的解放战争必将从地球上消灭和铲除帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    新华社开罗十六日电　据这里的报纸十六日报道，阿联劳工联合会十五日结束为期三天的文化会议后，发表声明，谴责加纳军事政变是帝国主义在加纳策划的阴谋，并且表示支持加纳工人。
    声明指出，帝国主义和反动派在非洲策划阴谋，目的是对民族解放运动施加压力。
    新华社科纳克里十四日电　恩克鲁玛总统十三日晚上通过几内亚电台再次向加纳人民发表广播讲话，号召加纳爱国军民联合起来，“赶走新殖民主义的走狗，赶走帝国主义。”
    他说：“我号召人民大会党党员，那些在独立前十分英勇地战胜殖民主义者的勇士们，我号召农民合作社理事会、加纳全国妇女理事会、加纳穆斯林理事会、工人大队、加纳九个地区的所有党组织和积极分子，以及最后但不是最不重要的，少年先锋运动和所有加纳青年，在这考验的时刻坚定地站稳立场，拒绝一切虚伪和欺骗，准备起义反抗这一暴虐的骗人的冒险家集团。我还号召我的武装部队和警察中的忠诚人员同群众结合起来，站在他们一边战斗，消灭这些叛乱的卖国贼和殖民主义的走狗。”
    恩克鲁玛总统指出：加纳叛乱分子成立的所谓“全国解放委员会”并不是“加纳新政府”，“只不过是一帮军事和警察冒险家，他们企图摧毁加纳人民的经济、政治和社会成果，使这种成果遭受挫折。他们进行这种穷凶极恶的勾当是受了新殖民主义者和他们的代理人的驱使。新殖民主义者和他们的代理人使用了暴力来使加纳人民继续处于被压迫的地位。但是他们一定会失败。”
    他说：帝国主义者和新殖民主义者“所做到了的只不过是援助和唆使冷酷屠杀爱国公民的疯狂的刽子手和那些杀害忠诚的无辜军官的人。新殖民主义在非洲的地位受到了我们的挑战，它很快也就会垮台。这些叛乱分子和卖国贼企图在加纳建立的无政府状态和恐怖气氛是维持不长久的。”
    恩克鲁玛说：“我知道，军队和警察里大部分人并不支持这个叛乱集团。”“他们现在即便是受到错误的引导、恫吓或者威胁，还是会同人民一道起来保卫人民的事业的。”
    恩克鲁玛指出，自从二月二十四日事件以来，“帝国主义者、新殖民主义者以及他们的代理人就源源涌入加纳，他们涌进这个国家，因为他们嗅到了一片他们可以进行经济奴役和谋求暴利的肥沃的土地。这一卖国贼和叛乱分子集团作了许多事，为他们准备好这片土地，让他们到加纳来。”
    恩克鲁玛强调指出：“打败了殖民主义的加纳群众，也将打败新殖民主义和它们在加纳的代理人。”
    他最后说：“我将亲自同你们呆在一起，当时间到来的时候，你们就一定会看到这一点。”
