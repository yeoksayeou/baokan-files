    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd – According to reports in local newspapers, the heroic South Vietnamese army and people, responding enthusiastically to the call of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front's statement on March 22, 1965, have fought valiantly and fiercely attacked the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs, achieving extremely brilliant victories in the past year.
    According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of April last year to the end of February this year, the South Vietnamese army and people have annihilated and disintegrated more than 214,000 enemy troops, including over 34,000 U.S. aggressor troops and 4,500 South Korean mercenary troops; shot down or destroyed 1,726 enemy aircraft and destroyed 1,985 military vehicles of various types (including 453 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and tanks); and sunk 75 enemy warships.
    From the beginning of April last year to March 13 this year, the South Vietnamese army and people completely wiped out 56 enemy battalions, including 15 U.S. aggressor battalions. Among the 15 U.S. battalions completely wiped out, there were six infantry battalions and six armored battalions of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, one battalion of the 1st Cavalry Division, one battalion of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division, and one battalion of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade.
    The number of U.S. aggressors annihilated by the South Vietnamese army and people in the past year shows that the more U.S. aggressors are sent, the more will be eliminated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces of Ba Ria province in South Vietnam fiercely attacked the U.S. military airport and a puppet army political training school in the Vung Tau area on the evening of March 12.
    According to initial reports, the liberation armed forces killed or wounded more than 220 U.S. aggressor troops (including a U.S. Army colonel) and more than 100 puppet troops in this battle, destroying many aircraft and rendering the airport unusable.
    On this evening, the Ba Ria Provincial Liberation Armed Forces secretly crossed the enemy's outer strongholds and fiercely attacked this strategic base of the U.S. aggressors on the coast. The liberation armed forces bombarded the U.S. military airport, communications command center, barracks, and U.S. military officers' club with intense mortar fire. Dense shells accurately hit the targets, and enemy aircraft were hit and caught fire. As soon as the battle began, the entire airport was completely paralyzed, and no enemy aircraft had time to escape.
    This sudden attack by the liberation armed forces greatly panicked the U.S.-puppet clique. In order to cover up their heavy losses, the U.S. aggressors have continuously forbidden puppet troops, puppet regime personnel, and local people from entering the vicinity of the Vung Tau base for several days.
    (Editor's note: Vung Tau is located at the southernmost tip of Ba Ria province, only forty-five miles northwest of Saigon, and just over ten miles from Ba Ria, the provincial capital of Ba Ria province. It is connected to the north-south Highway 1 and Highway 15 by road. Facing the South China Sea, it is the only way for ships entering and leaving Saigon, and its strategic position is very important.
    In order to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson administration has turned Vung Tau into an important stronghold of the "ink blot strategy" for the invasion of South Vietnam, establishing a modern naval and air base, and stationed thousands of U.S. troops there. The so-called "U.S.-Vietnam Joint Command" has also been established here.)
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd – The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency published a commentary, warmly hailing the great victory of the South Vietnam Ba Ria Provincial Liberation Armed Forces' attack on the U.S. military base in Vung Tau on March 12.
    The commentary said that the great victory in Vung Tau once again demonstrated the Liberation Army's incredibly brave fighting spirit, extremely outstanding command and tactics, and also showed the close coordination between the various armed forces and between the army and the people.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd – Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces attacked the enemy's Kim Ly Airport, four kilometers northwest of Da Lat city, in the early hours of March 22, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Armed Forces carried out a fierce bombardment with mortars, causing "serious damage" to the airport. Shells hit aircraft parked at the airport, and "several aircraft were damaged." A fuel depot also caught fire. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the Liberation Armed Forces launched an offensive, stormed the airport, and severely attacked the enemy.
    According to another report, the Liberation Armed Forces shelled the enemy airport in Phan Thiet, 160 kilometers northeast of Saigon, with mortars in the early hours of March 21.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, South Vietnamese guerrillas have recently been closely coordinating with the Liberation Army's offensive in various places, continuously attacking the enemy and cutting off the enemy's land and water transportation lines, and constantly achieving new victories.
    Guerrillas in Son Tinh district, Quang Ngai province, actively coordinated with the Liberation Army in carrying out anti-"mopping up" battles in this district, containing the enemy and eliminating a large number of enemy forces. According to statistics from March 4 to 7, the guerrillas in only four villages, namely Tinh Tho, Tinh Binh, Tinh Son, and Tinh Ha, killed or wounded 141 U.S. and puppet troops, the vast majority of whom were U.S. troops, shot down or damaged eight enemy aircraft, and captured a batch of weapons and ammunition.
    In order to coordinate with the Liberation Army's attack on the puppet troops in Cai Lay town, My Tho province, guerrillas destroyed the Long Dinh Bridge on Highway 4 on the night of March 15, cutting off the connection between the southern western region and Saigon and preventing the enemy from reinforcing.
    In the Saigon-Gia Dinh area, guerrillas attacked and burned five ships carrying military supplies on the Saigon River in the early hours of March 12, and the explosions continued from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
    In Thua Thien province, guerrillas often attacked the enemy on the railway and Highway 1 from Hue to Da Nang and from Hue to Quang Tri in a sneaky manner. In the past two months, they have destroyed four M-113 armored vehicles, four military vehicles, overturned twelve locomotives, and destroyed twenty iron and cement bridges, killing many enemies.
    According to another report from this news agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Rach Gia province fiercely attacked the Ca Rong stronghold in Dinh Hoa commune, Go Quao district, on the night of the 9th. According to preliminary reports, more than 130 puppet troops were killed or wounded, and the puppet army battalion commander and a lieutenant were killed. (Attached picture)
    On November 12th of last year, a unit of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army annihilated more than 2,000 U.S. troops of the 1st Infantry Division in the Bao Bang area.

    人民战争必然战胜美帝国主义侵略战争的生动证明
    南越军民一年内歼敌二十一万四千人
    歼美军三万四千多全歼美军十五个整营
    人民武装猛袭头顿机场歼美军二百多人使机场无法使用
    新华社河内二十二日电 据此间报纸报道，英雄的越南南方军民热烈响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六五年三月二十二日声明的号召，一年来英勇战斗，猛烈打击美国侵略军及其走狗，取得了极为辉煌的胜利。
    据不完全统计，从去年四月初到今年二月底，越南南方军民已经歼灭和瓦解敌人二十一万四千多名，其中包括打死、打伤美国侵略军三万四千多名、南朝鲜帮凶军四千五百名；击落和击毁敌机一千七百二十六架，击毁各种类型军车一千九百八十五辆（其中包括M—113型两栖装甲车和坦克四百五十三辆），击沉敌舰艇七十五艘。
    从去年四月初到今年三月十三日，越南南方军民共全歼敌人五十六个整营，其中全歼美国侵略军十五个整营。在被全歼的美军十五个整营中，包括美国第一步兵师六个步兵营、六个装甲营，第一骑兵师一个营，美国第三海军陆战师一个营，美国第一七三空降旅一个营。
    越南南方军民一年来歼灭美国侵略者的数字表明，美国侵略军增兵越多，被消灭的也越多。
    新华社河内二十一日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方巴地省解放武装力量三月十二日晚间猛烈袭击了头顿地区的美军飞机场和一所伪军政治训练学校。
    据初步消息，解放武装力量在这次战斗中，打死打伤二百二十多名美国侵略军
  （其中包括一名美军上校）和一百多名伪军，击毁许多飞机，使这个机场无法继续使用。
    这一天晚上，巴地省解放武装力量秘密越过敌人的外围据点，猛烈地袭击了这个美国侵略军在沿海的战略基地。解放武装力量用猛烈的迫击炮火轰击美军机场、通讯指挥中心、兵营和美国军官俱乐部。密集的炮弹准确地落到目标上，敌机纷纷中弹起火燃烧。战斗一开始，整个机场就完全陷于瘫痪状态，没有一架敌机来得及逃脱。
    解放武装力量的这次突然袭击，使美伪集团非常惊慌。美国侵略者为了掩盖自己的惨重损失，连续好几天严禁伪军、伪政权人员和当地人民进入头顿基地附近地区。
    （编者注：头顿位于巴地省的最南端，西北距西贡仅四十五英里，与巴地省省会巴地相距不过十多英里，有公路与纵贯南北的一号公路和十五号公路相联接，面临南中国海，是出进西贡的舰船必经之地，战略地位十分重要。
    约翰逊政府为了扩大侵越战争，把头顿变成侵略南越的“墨渍战略”的一个重要据点，建立了现代化的海空军基地，驻扎了数千美军。在这里还设立了所谓“美国—越南联合司令部”。）
    据新华社河内二十二日电越南南方解放通讯社发表评论，热烈欢呼越南南方巴地省解放武装力量三月十二日袭击头顿美军基地的重大胜利。
    评论说，头顿大捷又一次表明了解放军部队具有无比勇敢的战斗精神，极为出色的指挥和战术，同时也显示了各武装力量之间和军民之间的密切配合。
    新华社二十二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十二日凌晨袭击大叻市西北四公里的敌军金利机场，使敌人遭到重大损失。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量用迫击炮猛烈进行轰击，使这个机场遭到“严重破坏”。炮弹击中了停留在机场上的飞机，“若干飞机遭到了破坏”。一个燃料库也燃烧了起来。乘守敌一片混乱的时候，解放武装力量发动了进攻，冲进机场，狠狠地打击了敌人。
    另据报道，解放武装力量二十一日凌晨曾用迫击炮轰击了西贡东北一百六十公里的藩切敌军机场。
    新华社河内二十二日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方游击队最近在各地密切配合解放军的进攻，连续袭击敌人和切断敌人的水陆交通线，不断取得新战绩。
    广义省山晶县游击队积极配合解放军在这个县进行反
  “扫荡”战斗，牵制敌人，歼灭敌人大批有生力量。据三月四日到七日的统计，仅靖寿、靖平、靖山和靖河四个乡的游击队就打死、打伤美伪军一百四十一名，其中绝大部分是美军，击落、击伤敌机八架，缴获一批武器和弹药。
    美萩省游击队为了配合解放军进攻丐礼镇的伪军，三月十五日夜里炸毁了四号公路上的隆定桥，切断了南部西区同西贡的联系，使敌人无法增援。
    在西贡—嘉定地区，游击队在三月十二日凌晨袭击和烧毁了行驶在西贡河上的五艘运载军火的船只，爆炸声从凌晨四时一直延续到上午八时没有断绝。
    在承天省，游击队经常神出鬼没地袭击从顺化到岘港、从顺化到广治的铁路和一号公路上的敌人，两个月来共击毁敌人M—113型装甲车四辆、军车四辆，炸翻机车十二列，炸毁铁桥和水泥桥二十座，并且打死敌人多名。
    另据这家通讯社报道，迪石省解放武装力量九日夜里猛烈袭击鹅高县定和乡的卡容据点。据初步消息，共打死、打伤伪军一百三十多名，伪军营长和一名中尉被打死。（附图片）
