    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- Vietnam's *People's Army Newspaper* published an observer's article on the 15th, pointing out that the United States' failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam is doomed. The magic weapon for the Vietnamese people to defeat US imperialism is the invincible people's war.

    The article emphasized that in South Vietnam, although the US aggressors have many guns, ammunition, airplanes, artillery, tanks, etc., the US military is still suffering defeat after defeat. This is because weapons are not the decisive factor in victory or defeat on the battlefield. The United States is waging an unjust war, so its morale is low and its combat effectiveness is very weak.

    The article said that the United States believes that because it has more troops, more money, and more weapons, it can continue to push forward with its war of aggression against Vietnam. Currently, it is massively increasing troops and weapons to South Vietnam, seeing this as a "life-saving talisman." In fact, this is nothing more than a desperate struggle.

    The article pointed out that the factors that determine the United States' inevitable failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam are:

    First, the United States is an international gendarme, pursuing a counter-revolutionary global strategy. It must both salvage its predicament in South Vietnam and deal with the burgeoning national liberation movements in various places, while also guarding against its "allies" taking advantage of its weakness to squeeze it out. In this way, the several million troops in the hands of the United States are forced to be dispersed in more than two thousand military bases around the world, ready to deal with frequently occurring crises at any time. Therefore, every time it increases troops to South Vietnam, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul.

    Second, the frequent offensives of world revolutionary forces have put the United States in a passive and reactive position in various places. Every time it escalates on the Vietnamese battlefield, it has to consider the consequences.

    Third, the United States' passive situation in the world and its failure on the South Vietnamese battlefield are causing strong reactions within the United States. The American people are increasingly and powerfully opposing the US authorities' war of aggression against Vietnam. Within the US ruling group, there are also disagreements on issues such as offense versus defense, quick war versus long war, how many troops to send, and to what extent the US military should be used on the battlefield. They quarrel with each other, the more they quarrel, the more contradictions arise, the more they find themselves without a way out, and the more they are trapped in a passive predicament in the war.

    Fourth, the United States attempts to cover up its aggressive face with a form of neo-colonialism, but the entry of US troops into South Vietnam and the brutal crimes it has committed in Vietnam have completely exposed the aggressive face of the United States. This makes it even more politically isolated.

    Fifth, the US troop increase cannot save the collapse of the puppet army and the puppet regime. The more US troops enter South Vietnam, the more the traitorous face of the puppet clique is exposed, the more acute the national contradictions between the Vietnamese people and the United States become, and the more the contradictions between the United States and the puppet regime develop.

    The article said that the United States' tactics are also the clumsiest. The US commanders, because of their blind faith in weapons and subjective idealism, underestimate the strength of the enemy, so they repeatedly make mistakes. Although the United States has summarized various experiences in aggressive warfare and applied them to Vietnam, they have all been met with failure.

    The article finally pointed out that the South Vietnamese army and people are fighting for justice, so their fighting spirit is high. The South Vietnamese people have the upper hand both militarily and politically. The forces of justice, the correct guiding line, the unity of the whole people, and the support and encouragement of progressive humanity are being transformed into the material strength of the people's war. The South Vietnamese people have defeated and will certainly be able to completely defeat the US imperialist war of aggression.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- According to a broadcast by the South Vietnam Liberation Radio: On March 10th, the South Vietnam Liberation Army captured the enemy's A Shau stronghold in an area on the Vietnam-Laos border, 45 kilometers southwest of Hue City, and annihilated a US "Special Forces" unit.

    According to preliminary reports, a total of more than 400 enemy troops were eliminated, and seven American airplanes were shot down.

    This battle was very fierce. The heroic Liberation Army soldiers engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Making US aircraft powerless and unable to save the fate of the enemy's ground forces from being annihilated.

    According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Bien Hoa Province, South Vietnam, completely annihilated a company of US aggressor troops and heavily damaged another company in a counter-"mopping-up" operation on February 26, killing and wounding more than 200 US troops, shooting down three HU-1A helicopters, damaging several others, and seizing a large number of weapons.

    The Liberation Armed Forces of Thua Thien Province successively frustrated multiple "mopping-up" operations by the enemy with four or five battalions of troops from February 21st to 28th, eliminating more than 570 enemy troops, including 108 US aggressor troops; shooting down four enemy planes, including three B-57 bombers.

    Guang Nam Province guerrillas continuously launched counter-"mopping-up" operations in late February, eliminating 620 enemy troops, most of whom were US aggressor troops, and shooting down and destroying 17 US aircraft.

    越南《人民军队报》指出美帝大量增兵和增加武器只不过是绝望挣扎
    南越人民战争是战胜美帝的法宝
    美帝迷信武器主观唯心必遭失败
    南越人民武装一举攻克敌阿绍据点全歼美军一支“特种部队”
    新华社河内十五日电　越南《人民军队报》十五日发表观察家文章指出，美国在侵越战争中的失败是注定了的。越南人民战胜美帝国主义的法宝就是无敌的人民战争。
    文章强调指出，在越南南方，美国侵略者虽然有很多的枪支、弹药、飞机、大炮、坦克等，但是美军却连吃败仗。因为武器不是战场上胜负的决定因素。美国进行的是一场非正义的战争，因此，它的士气低落，战斗力很弱。
    文章说，美国以为它的军队多，钱多，武器多，可以继续推行侵越战争，目前它正在向南越大量增兵，增加武器，把这看作是“救命符”。其实，这只不过是它绝望的挣扎而已。
    文章指出，决定美国在侵越战争中必然失败的因素是：
    第一，美国是国际宪兵，正在推行反革命的全球战略，它既要挽救在越南南方的窘境，又要对付各地蓬勃发展的民族解放运动，同时还要提防它的“盟友”乘虚挤掉它。这样，美国手中的几百万军队就被迫分散在遍及全世界的两千多个军事基地中，要随时准备应付经常发生的危机。因此，它每向越南南方增兵一次，都要剜肉补疮。
    第二，世界革命力量的频繁进攻使美国在各地陷于被动应付的处境。它在越南战场每上升一级，都不得不有所考虑。
    第三，美国在世界上的被动处境和在越南南方战场上的失败，正在美国国内引起强烈的反应。美国人民日益强有力地反对美国当局对越南进行的侵略战争。美国统治集团内部在进攻还是防御，速战还是长期打，增派多少军队，在战场上使用美军到什么程度等问题上的主张也不一致。他们互相争吵，越争吵矛盾越多，越没有出路，越使它在战争中陷于被动的窘境。
    第四，美国企图以新殖民主义形式来掩盖它的侵略面目，但是美军进入越南南方和它在越南犯下的残暴罪行完全暴露了美国的侵略面目。这使得它在政治上更加陷于孤立。
    第五，美国增兵也无法挽救伪军和伪政权的瓦解。美军进入越南南方越多，走狗集团的卖国面目就越暴露无遗，越南人民同美国之间的民族矛盾就更为尖锐，美国同伪政权之间的矛盾也日益发展。
    文章说，美国的战术也是最拙劣的。美国的指挥官由于迷信武器，主观唯心，过低估计对方的力量，所以，他们屡犯错误。尽管美国总结了各种侵略战争经验，把它运用于越南，但是却都遭到了失败。
    文章最后指出，越南南方军民是为正义而战，所以斗志昂扬。越南南方人民无论在军事上和政治上都占优势。正义的力量，正确的指导路线，全民团结和进步人类的支持和鼓舞，正在变成人民战争的物质力量。越南南方人民已经打败并且一定能够完全打败美帝国主义的侵略战争。
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：三月十日，越南南方解放军在距离顺化市西南四十五公里的越南一老挝边境地区，一举攻克敌阿绍据点，全歼美军一支“特种部队”。
    据初步消息，共消灭敌军四百多名，击落美国飞机七架。
    这次战斗进行得非常激烈。英勇的解放军战士同敌人展开了肉搏战。使美国飞机无能为力，挽救不了敌军地面部队被歼的命运。
    另据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省解放武装力量二月二十六日在反“扫荡”战斗中，全歼美国侵略军一个连，重创另一个连，共打死、打伤美军二百多名，击落HU—1A型直升飞机三架，击伤多架，缴获了大批武器。
    承天省解放武装力量从二月二十一日到二十八日接连挫败了敌人四、五个营兵力的多次“扫荡”，共歼灭敌人五百七十多名，其中有一百零八名美国侵略军；击落敌机四架，其中有三架是B—57型轰炸机。
    广南省游击队二月下旬连续展开反“扫荡”战斗，歼灭敌人六百二十名，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军，击落和击毁美国飞机十七架。
