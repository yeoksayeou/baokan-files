    Reckoning for the Revolution
    -- How the Mashanzhuang Brigade Achieved a Double Harvest of Grain and Cotton Last Year
    In 1964, the Mashanzhuang Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Cao County, Shandong Province, became one of the advanced units in national cotton production due to its high cotton yield on saline-alkali land. However, it consumed a lot of grain from the state. Last year, the brigade leaped forward to become a unit with double harvests of grain and cotton. Cotton production increased compared to the previous year, and it even sold surplus grain to the state for the first time.
    To understand how this change came about, the key is that the cadres and members correctly calculated a major account and established the ideology of farming for the revolution.
          The First Reckoning
    The cotton fields of the Mashanzhuang Brigade account for more than 40% of the total cultivated land area. In 1964, the brigade's 1,100 mu of cotton achieved unprecedented good harvests. The amount of ginned cotton sold to the state that year was equal to the sales volume of the past nine years, exceeding the state's cotton purchase plan. According to the contract between the Mashanzhuang Brigade and the state, as long as the state's cotton procurement plan was fulfilled, the state would guarantee a supply of 160,000 jin of grain to the Mashanzhuang Brigade to compensate for the grain shortage caused by cotton planting. However, the grain harvest of the Mashanzhuang Brigade was also relatively good that year. After the autumn harvest, it was calculated that only an additional 100,000 jin would be enough, in addition to what they produced themselves. Therefore, it was decided to request 60,000 jin less from the state.
    The problem arose here: the contract stipulated a supply of 160,000 jin, but only 100,000 jin were consumed. How should this be calculated?
    At the time, most people felt that this account was obvious and easy to calculate: selling cotton to the state and consuming state grain was fair and reasonable. Consuming less meant saving for the state. "Saving 60,000 jin is a significant contribution to the state!"
    After people calculated the account this way, they lived comfortably through 1964. What about 1965? Everyone felt that maintaining the level of 1964 would be good enough. That's what was said, but the contract for 1965 requested the state to supply 165,000 jin of grain, 5,000 jin more than the contract for 1964, on the grounds that the cotton planting area had increased by 35 mu.
        Recalculating the Account
    In early spring last year, Zhu Baoshan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Mashanzhuang Brigade, went to Beijing to attend the Fourth National Cotton Production Conference for Concentrated Cotton-Producing Counties. After listening to the conference, he immediately realized that the account from the previous year had been calculated incorrectly. He first discovered that his brigade's cotton yield was far behind other advanced units. Some counties had an average yield of 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and some brigades had already reached 200 jin per mu, while also achieving high yields of both grain and cotton. However, he was complacent with 97 jin. Zhu Baoshan further realized that the main difference was not in yield but in ideology. People were planting cotton for the revolution and farming for the revolution, regarding producing more cotton and grain and selling it to the state as a duty to the revolution. He, on the other hand, was bargaining with the state, regarding consuming state-supplied grain as "a matter of course," and not actively seeking ways to achieve grain self-sufficiency. Because he lacked the ideology of farming for the revolution, he had miscalculated the account.
      Upon returning from Beijing, Zhu Baoshan immediately convened a branch committee meeting to study how to implement the spirit of the National Cotton Production Conference for Concentrated Cotton-Producing Counties. Everyone agreed that to meet the demands of the Party and the state in 1965, it was necessary to sell more cotton to the state and achieve grain self-sufficiency without relying on state-supplied grain. Therefore, it was first necessary to establish the ideology of farming for the revolution and to properly recalculate the account of 1964. This was because it was both an ordinary account and a major account that could reflect two different ideologies. Different ideologies would lead to different calculations. It was then decided to mobilize the masses to recalculate the account.
    The news from Beijing greatly shocked the cadres and members. In particular, the care and expectations of the Party and the state stirred people's hearts like a warm current. Many people examined their complacency and their tendency to think less for the revolution and more for their own unit and themselves. Some said, "Now, the people of the whole country are fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism. We have not made much contribution but are instead burdening the state. It's too wrong!" Some said:
  "Producing cotton is the responsibility of us rural commune members, and we shouldn't haggle with the state." After some discussion, everyone adopted another calculation method for that account: 160,000 minus 60,000 still meant consuming 100,000 jin of grain from the state. If they could achieve double harvests of cotton and grain, these 100,000 jin could be saved. Everyone said: since it is farming for the revolution, the account must be calculated this way.
    To help the commune members calculate the account more thoroughly, the Party branch also made the following calculation with everyone: in 1964, consuming 100,000 jin of grain from the state not only increased the state's burden but also cost 8,000 yuan to buy these grains, which meant the team had 8,000 yuan less income. This 8,000 yuan could be used to dig eight machine wells, irrigating 800 mu of land; if buying cattle, it could buy twenty cattle. This calculation surprised everyone even more, making them realize that whether for the state, the collective, or individuals, they should strive for double harvests of grain and cotton.
      Whether It is Possible to Not Consume Supplied Grain
    The commune members called the Party's instruction this time: "the spring breeze blowing from Beijing." Some commune members said, "We didn't catch up with the Long March, nor did we experience the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. Today, farming is a test for us, and we must hold high the red flag of high yields of both grain and cotton!"
    However, the account was not yet fully calculated. Because whether it *should* be done is one thing, whether it is *possible* is another. Was it possible to achieve double harvests of grain and cotton and not consume state-supplied grain? To this end, the Party branch led the commune members to continue calculating this account.
    The Mashanzhuang Brigade has a total of 2,652 mu of cultivated land and 1,450 people. After excluding 1,100 mu of cotton fields and a small amount of land for growing vegetables and other crops, each person still had nearly one mu of grain fields. Everyone believed that one mu of grain field per person could completely achieve grain self-sufficiency with surplus. So why was it not achieved in 1964? After investigation, everyone began to realize that it was not a problem of land but a problem of people. First, to increase cash income, 200 mu of radishes and 60 mu of melons were planted, reducing the sown area of grain crops. Second, field management of grain crops was relaxed; pests were not treated, and weeds were not removed in time, resulting in reduced grain production. The reason for this was that the state-supplied grain was regarded as a support, and they did not have a plan in mind to solve the grain problem themselves ideologically.
    Ideological understanding was improved, and methods to increase production also emerged. In addition to the above two points, everyone believed that the potential for grain production was still great. Some proposed that in 1964, two and a half mu of spring corn were planted, with an average yield of 700 jin per mu, which was one or two times higher than the yield of sorghum and millet. The planting area of spring corn should be expanded. Some proposed that three crops in two years should be changed to two crops in one year, and the area of intercropping and relay intercropping should be expanded to increase the multiple cropping index. Some proposed that careful management should be strengthened and the amount of fertilizer applied should be increased. Everyone believed that if these measures were taken, each mu of land could yield 500 jin of grain, while in 1964, only 368 jin were obtained. If those 260 mu of radishes and melons were not planted, the grain field area could reach 1,400 mu, and the total grain output could reach 700,000 jin. Self-sufficiency would be achieved, and tens of thousands of jin of grain would be left over. If the weather were favorable, it would be possible to provide 100,000 jin of marketable grain to the state.
      This analysis and calculation ultimately became the Mashanzhuang Brigade's 1965 grain production plan. As for cotton, everyone believed that conditions were fully in place to continue increasing production.
          Double Harvest of Grain and Cotton
      The year 1965 was full of disasters and difficulties for the Mashanzhuang Brigade, including drought, wind, hail, pests, and cold and low temperatures, one after another. However, the commune members said, "The revolution is not always smooth sailing. We must overcome natural disasters!"
    They first launched a struggle to win a bumper wheat harvest. After several rounds, the first shot was finally fired: 1,100 mu of wheat yielded 220,000 jin, which exactly reached their estimated target of 200 jin per mu.
    In last year's cotton production, the people of Mashanzhuang fought a protracted war against natural disasters. After sowing, the cotton seedlings encountered low-temperature and cold damage. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members withstood the difficulties. For cotton seedlings that had not yet emerged from the soil, they used their hands to peel off the hardened topsoil to allow them to emerge. For cotton fields with missing seedlings, they used the "seedling transplantation" method to replant.
    To peel and replant the seedlings, all cadres and members had to kneel and work for more than ten hours a day, crawling two li in the cotton fields. In this way, they worked hard for more than twenty days, preserving more than 900 mu of early seedlings and planting 1.45 million seedlings, which was equivalent to planting 300 mu of cotton one by one.
    After the cotton seedlings were all secured, a severe drought came after the wheat harvest. It did not rain for more than two months. A large area of wheat stubble land could not be planted, and autumn-ripening grain crops and cotton were dying from drought. The Party branch organized cadres and members to study Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and called on commune members to fight a "protracted war" and carry out the drought resistance struggle with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.
    The cadres and members of the Mashanzhuang Brigade finally overcame various natural disasters with their steel-like revolutionary will and won a great harvest: the brigade's 1,135 mu of cotton averaged 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 24% compared to 1964; the 1,393 mu of grain fields averaged 495 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 35% compared to 1964, with a total output of 690,000 jin, an increase of 230,000 jin compared to 1964.
    The double harvest of grain and cotton enabled the Mashanzhuang Brigade to make a double contribution to the state for the first time: selling more than 130,000 jin of cotton and 40,000 jin of grain to the state. The Mashanzhuang Brigade itself not only increased income and rations but also retained 7,000 jin of reserve grain.
    The cadres and members of the Mashanzhuang Brigade celebrated the bumper harvest of grain and cotton, and even more, they celebrated the ideological harvest. In summarizing last year's production experience, they believed that the first experience was: having the ideology of farming for the revolution. It was precisely this ideology that ensured the double increase in grain and cotton production.

    为革命算账
    ——马山庄大队去年是怎样取得粮棉双丰收的
    山东省曹县城关公社马山庄大队一九六四年由于在盐碱地上种棉获得高产量，成了全国棉花生产的先进单位之一，但是却吃了国家很多粮食。去年，这个大队一跃而为粮、棉双丰收的队，棉花比前年增产，还第一次向国家出售了余粮。
    要问这个变化是怎样来的，关键是干部、社员算对了一笔大账，树立了为革命种田的思想。
          第一次算账
    马山庄大队的棉田面积占耕地总面积百分之四十以上。一九六四年，全大队的一千一百亩棉花得到了空前的好收成，这一年向国家交售的皮棉等于过去九年的交售量，超额完成了向国家售棉的计划。按照马山庄大队和国家订立的合同，只要完成了国家的棉花收购计划，国家便保证供应马山庄大队十六万斤粮食，以补充因为植棉而产生的粮食不足。但是，这一年马山庄大队的粮食收成也比较好，秋后一算，除了自己生产的，再添十万斤就够了。因此，决定少向国家要六万斤粮。
    这笔账也就出在这里：合同规定供应十六万斤，只吃了十万斤，这应该怎样算法？
    当时，大部分人觉得这笔账是明摆着的，很容易算：把棉花卖给国家，吃国家的粮，公平合理，少吃了就是给国家省了。“少吃六万斤，对国家就是不小的贡献！”
    人们这样算了这笔账之后，就心安理得地度过了一九六四年。一九六五年怎样干？大家觉得只要保住一九六四年的水平就算不赖。话是这样说，可是在一九六五年的合同上却要国家供应十六万五千斤粮食，比一九六四年的合同数还多五千斤，理由是植棉面积增加了三十五亩。
        重新算这笔账
    去年初春，马山庄大队党支部书记朱保善到北京参加了第四次全国集中产棉县棉花生产会议。他在会议上一听，立刻发觉前年那笔账算得不对头。他首先发现自己大队的棉花产量远远落在其它先进单位后面。人家有的县平均亩产皮棉一百三十斤，有的大队已经达到二百斤，而且还是粮棉双高产；可是，自己却在为九十七斤而自满自足。朱保善进而发现，主要的差距还不在产量上，而在思想上。人家是在为革命种棉花，为革命种田，把多生产棉粮，向国家出售棉粮，当作向革命应尽的责任；而自己却在和国家讲价钱，把吃国家供应的粮食看成是“理所当然”的，不积极想办法做到粮食自给。正因为自己缺少为革命种田的思想，才把这笔账算错了。
      从北京回来，朱保善立即召开了支部委员会，研究如何贯彻执行全国集中产棉县棉花生产会议的精神。大家认为，要使一九六五年的生产达到党和国家的要求，既多向国家出售棉花，又做到粮食自给，不要国家供应粮食，就先得树立起为革命种田的思想，就先得把一九六四年那笔账算好。因为那既是一笔普通的账，又是一笔能反映出两种不同思想的大账；思想不同，就会有两种不同的算法。于是决定，发动群众重新算那笔账。
    来自北京的消息使干部和社员受到很大震动，特别是党和国家的关怀和期望，象一股暖流激动着人们的心。很多人检查了骄傲自满和为革命想得少、为本单位为个人想得多的思想。有的说：“现在，全国人民正在同美帝国主义、现代修正主义作斗争，咱们没作出多少贡献，却在拖累国家，太不应该！”有的说：
  “生产棉花是咱农村社员的责任，不应该向国家讨价还价。”经过一番议论，大家对那一笔账采用了另一种算法：十六万减去六万，还是吃了国家十万斤粮食。如果自己做到棉粮双丰收，这十万斤就可以省下来。大家说：既然是为革命种田，这笔账就得这样算。
    为了使社员们把这笔账算得更透，党支部还跟大家作了这样的计算：一九六四年吃了国家十万斤粮食，不但增加了国家的负担，而且买这些粮食，一共花了八千元，等于队里少收入了八千元。这八千元用来打井，可以打八眼机井，浇八百亩地；要是买牛，可以买二十头牛。这一算，大家更是吃了一惊，知道了不论是为国家、为集体还是为个人，都应当争取粮棉双丰收。
      能不能不吃供应粮
    社员们把党的这次教导叫做是：“从北京吹来的春风”。有些社员说：“咱没赶上万里长征，也没经过抗日战争和解放战争的考验。今天，种田就是对咱的考验，咱要把粮棉双高产的红旗举起来！”
    但是，那笔账并没有算完。因为应不应该是一回事，可不可能又是一回事。有没有可能做到棉粮双丰收，不吃国家供应粮呢？为此，党支部领导社员们继续把这笔账算下去。
    马山庄大队共有耕地二千六百五十二亩，一千四百五十人。除去一千一百亩棉田，再除去少量种蔬菜及其它作物的地，每人还有近一亩粮田。大家认为，每人一亩粮田完全可以实现粮食自给有余。那么一九六四年为什么没有做到呢？经过检查，大家开始认识到，不是地的问题，而是人的问题。第一、为了增加现金收入，种了二百亩萝卜和六十亩甜瓜，减少了粮食作物播种面积。第二、对粮食作物放松了田间管理，有虫害不治，有杂草不及时除，结果粮食减产了。而所以这样做，是因为把国家的供应粮当成了靠山，思想上就没有打自己解决粮食问题的谱。
    思想认识提高了，增产的办法也就来了。除了以上的两条，大家认为粮食增产的潜力还很大。有人提出，一九六四年种了二亩半春玉米，平均每亩收了七百斤，比高粱、谷子的产量高一两倍，应该扩大春玉米的播种面积；有人提出应该把二年三作改为一年两作，并扩大间作套种的面积，提高复种指数；有人提出要加工细管，增加施肥量。大家认为，如果采取这些措施，每亩地就可以拿到五百斤粮食，而一九六四年只拿到了三百六十八斤。如果不种那二百六十亩萝卜和甜瓜，粮田面积可以达到一千四百亩，粮食总产量可以达到七十万斤，自给自足还可以剩几万斤粮食，要是雨水调和，就有可能向国家提供十万斤商品粮。
      这个分析和计算，最后就成了马山庄大队一九六五年的粮食生产计划。至于棉花，大家认为完全有条件继续增产。
          粮棉双丰收
      马山庄大队一九六五年多灾多难，又是旱，又是风，又是雹，又是虫，还有寒潮低温，一个接着一个。可是，社员说：“革命，没有一帆风顺的，一定要战胜自然灾害！”
    他们首先展开了夺取小麦丰收的斗争。经过几个回合，第一炮到底打响了：一千一百亩小麦收了二十二万斤，正好达到了他们预计的亩产二百斤的指标。
    在去年的棉花生产中，马山庄人同自然灾害打了一场持久战。播种以后，棉苗遇到了低温冷害。社员们在党支部领导下顶住了困难，对还没出土的棉苗，用手把表层的硬土扒掉，让它出土；对缺苗的棉田用“芽苗移栽”法补苗。
    为了扒苗、补苗，全体干部、社员每天要跪着干十多个小时，在棉田里爬行二里路。就这样，他们苦干了二十多天，保住了九百多亩早苗子，栽苗一百四十五万棵，等于一棵一棵地栽了三百亩棉花。
    棉花拿住了全苗，麦收以后，又来了大旱，一连两个多月没下雨，大面积的麦茬地种不上，秋熟粮食作物和棉花又旱得要死。党支部组织干部和社员学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》，号召社员打
  “持久战”，以愚公移山的精神开展抗旱斗争。
    马山庄大队的干部和社员，终于以钢铁般的革命意志战胜种种自然灾害，夺得了大丰收：全大队一千一百三十五亩棉花平均每亩产皮棉一百二十斤，比一九六四年增产百分之二十四；一千三百九十三亩粮田平均每亩产粮食四百九十五斤，比一九六四年增产百分之三十五，总产量为六十九万斤，比一九六四年增产了二十三万斤。
    粮棉双丰收使马山庄大队第一次对国家有了双贡献：卖给国家十三万多斤棉花，四万多斤粮食。而马山庄大队自己，不但收入和口粮增加了，还留了七千斤储备粮。
    马山庄大队的干部和社员们欢庆粮食和棉花的丰收，更欢庆思想上的丰收。在总结去年生产经验的时候，他们认为，第一条经验就是：有了为革命种田的思想。正是这种思想，才保证了粮、棉双增产。
