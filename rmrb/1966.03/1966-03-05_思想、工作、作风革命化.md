    Ideological, Work Style, and Work Method Revolutionization
    Bao Xi, Deputy Secretary of the Zhalute Banner Party Committee, Jerim League, Inner Mongolia
    After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I felt very uneasy. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have done too little work for the Party and the people, and my application of Chairman Mao's works is too poor.
    I have been working in Zhalute Banner for six or seven years, which is much longer than Comrade Jiao Yulu's time in Lankao. In terms of natural conditions, Zhalute Banner is also much better than Lankao. Why is it that under such favorable objective conditions, the work is not done well? The most fundamental reason is that my ideological revolutionization is far inferior to Comrade Jiao Yulu's. In work, I am satisfied with small achievements, burdened with the idea that agriculture is good and animal husbandry is very good. As a result, I don't stand high enough, don't see far enough, and don't move forward quickly enough. I have personal selfish thoughts, putting "I" first, fearing hardship and fatigue, and lacking the revolutionary spirit of "caring for the people's affairs and forgetting oneself as if one were nothing." In terms of work style, I don't go deep into reality very often, and my investigation and research and understanding of the situation are very insufficient. I rarely go to remote communes and brigades and difficult areas to work. Therefore, not to mention details, I have only a superficial understanding of the major situations in the banner.
    To overcome the above problems, we must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, go deep into reality, and work in a down-to-earth manner. Use our own practical actions to influence and promote the cadres and masses of the whole banner to study Chairman Mao's works well and promote the ideological revolutionization of the Banner Party Committee and all cadres.

    思想、工作、作风革命化
    内蒙古哲里木盟扎鲁特旗委副书记　包玺
    学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹，我感到十分不安，跟焦裕禄同志相比，为党为人民做的工作太少了，活学活用毛主席著作太差了。
    我来到扎鲁特旗工作已经六七年了，比焦裕禄同志在兰考的时间长得多。论自然条件，扎旗也比兰考好得多。为什么在这样有利的客观条件下，工作却做得不出色呢？最根本的原因，在于我的思想革命化远远不如焦裕禄同志。工作上，我满足于点滴成绩，背上了农业不错，牧业很好的包袱，结果站得不高，看得不远，前进的步伐不快；存有个人杂念，我字当先，怕苦，怕累，缺乏“关注人民事，忘身直若无”的革命精神。作风上，深入实际很不经常，调查研究、掌握情况十分不够，下乡工作到偏僻社队、艰苦地区很少，因此，不用说详情细节，就是对本旗的重大情况，也是一知半解，若明若暗。
    要克服以上存在的问题，必须向焦裕禄同志学习，认真活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席思想改造自己，深入实际，扎扎实实地工作。以自己的实际行动影响和推动全旗干部和群众，学好毛主席著作，促进旗委和全体干部的思想革命化。
