    Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Ministry of Education, the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union, and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to relevant units in Vietnam, strongly condemning the towering crime of American bandit aircraft frantically bombing Xiangfu School in Xiangxi County, Hatinh Province, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, killing and wounding fifty-seven students.
    In its telegram to the Ministry of Education of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Ministry of Education stated that the incident of American bandit aircraft frantically bombing Xiangfu School showed that the inhuman American imperialists would not hesitate to adopt all barbaric means to massacre peace-loving people, even slaughtering young and innocent children. This once again exposed that Johnson's so-called "peace" and "humanity" were merely to cover up his murderous and bandit nature and to cover up his evil conspiracy to continue expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The telegram said that Chinese educators strongly condemn and severely denounce this unprecedentedly barbaric crime of American imperialism, and vow to fully support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American and national salvation struggle through to the end.
    In its telegram to the Vietnam Education Union, the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union stated that the bloody crimes of American imperialism exposed its fascist ferocious face, and exposed the complete and utter hypocrisy of the "peace talks" swindle it was playing and the so-called "peace," "humanity," and other absurd claims. Chinese educators most strongly protested this fascist crime of American imperialism and expressed firm support to Vietnamese educators standing at the forefront of the anti-American and national salvation battle.
    The All-China Students' Federation telegraphed the Vietnam Students' Union, saying that the bombing of Xiangfu Middle School by American imperialism once again proved that its aggressive nature would never change until death. In its telegram, the All-China Students' Federation cheered the heroic Vietnamese people for achieving one victory after another in the anti-American and national salvation struggle. The telegram said that Chinese students resolutely and unreservedly support the anti-American and national salvation struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people and youth and students. No matter how the Johnson government struggles, the situation in which the Vietnamese people will win and American imperialism will be defeated cannot be changed.

    我教育部、教育工会和全国学联分别致电越南有关单位
    强烈谴责美机轰炸越南香福学校的罪行
    新华社十日讯  教育部、中国教育工会全国委员会和中华全国学生联合会今天分别打电报给越南的有关单位，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国河静省香溪县香福学校，炸死炸伤五十七名学生的滔天罪行。
    教育部在致越南民主共和国教育部的电报中说，美国强盗飞机疯狂轰炸香福学校的事件表明，灭绝人性的美帝国主义者不惜采取一切野蛮手段残杀爱好和平的人民，甚至残杀年幼无辜的孩子，这再一次揭露了约翰逊叫嚷的“和平”“人道”只不过是掩盖它杀人强盗的本性，掩盖它继续扩大侵略越南战争的罪恶阴谋。
    电报说，中国教育工作者强烈谴责和严厉声讨美帝国主义这种空前野蛮的残暴罪行，并誓以全力支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    中国教育工会全国委员会在致越南教育工会的电报中说，美帝国主义的血腥罪行暴露了它的法西斯狰狞面目，暴露了它大肆玩弄的“和谈”骗局和所谓“和平”、
  “人道”等等谰言的彻头彻尾的虚伪性。中国教育工作者最强烈地抗议美帝国主义的这一法西斯罪行，向站在抗美救国战斗前线的越南教育工作者表示坚决的支援。
    中华全国学生联合会致电越南学生联合会说，美帝国主义对香福中学的轰炸，再次证明它的侵略本性是至死不变的。全国学联在电报中欢呼英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的一个又一个的胜利。电报说，中国学生坚决地、无保留地支持兄弟的越南人民和青年、学生的抗美救国斗争，不管约翰逊政府怎样挣扎，越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败的局势是改变不了的。
