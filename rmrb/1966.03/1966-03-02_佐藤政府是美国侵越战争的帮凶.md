    The Sato government, since coming to power over a year ago, has not hesitated to sell out Japan's independence and security, consistently following the United States' aggressive and war-mongering policies, and tightly binding Japan to the American war chariot. US imperialism is driving the Japanese reactionaries to serve its further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam; while Japanese monopoly capitalists and their agents are attempting to take advantage of the situation and profit from the war, hoping to get a share of the spoils. As US Vice President Humphrey recently said: "The United States needs Japan, and Japan needs the United States."
    In fact, Japan has already become a military factory and logistical base for US imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. With the Johnson administration's "gradual escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the scope and scale of the Japanese reactionaries' service to the United States has also gradually expanded. Sato openly clamored in a recent plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives that Japan "should fully, completely, and thoroughly fulfill the obligations stipulated in the US-Japan Security Treaty," and that "there is absolutely no reason to prevent Japan from providing bases to the United States, allowing US troops going to Vietnam to stay in Japan..." This shows that the Sato government is willing to be a shameful accomplice in the US aggression against Vietnam and the entire Indochina.
    Providing Bases for Aggression
    Currently, many US military bases in Japan are directly serving the war of aggression against Vietnam. American aggressive fleets frequently sail from ports such as Yokosuka and Sasebo to South Vietnam. In Tokyo alone, there are as many as twenty-four US military bases and facilities. Since August of last year, the largest US Air Force base in Tokyo, Yokota, and Tachikawa have been continuously transporting personnel, ammunition, weapons, medicines, and food to South Vietnam. Some of the US B-52 heavy bombers that are bombing Vietnam are taking off from Yokota Air Base. At the Itazuke base near Fukuoka City in southern Japan, the US military has deployed F-105 tactical fighters capable of carrying nuclear bombs. To date, US nuclear submarines have entered Japanese ports "for docking" eight times. According to the Asahi Shimbun on January 13, the Sato government has already decided in principle to agree to the docking in Japan of the US nuclear-powered fleet directly participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    To meet the needs of further expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States is expanding its military bases in Okinawa on a large scale. Construction is being stepped up at ten US military bases on the island. In Okinawa, 28 percent of the land is occupied by the US military. In the central areas of Naha and Kadena, there are missile bases, radar bases, and large airfields. According to the recent Okinawa Times, several freighters of about 14,000 to 15,000 tons can often be seen loading and unloading goods day and night at the pier in Naha Military Port, which is more than 2,000 meters long. This has become an outpost base for the United States to provide materials specifically to the front lines in South Vietnam. The US Marines stationed on the east coast of Okinawa receive military training here and are then sent to South Vietnam to participate in the bloody war of aggression.
    Supplying Military Materials
    The Japanese reactionaries not only allow the United States to use military bases on Japanese territory to invade Vietnam, but also produce large quantities of weapons and military supplies to meet the needs of the US aggressor troops. The Wall Street Journal of December 30 of last year pointed out that the US military
   "has begun to use Japan as a supply base for the Vietnam War," and Japan "has an extremely important role to play in maintaining various military operations in South Vietnam."
    It is reported that since last year, Japan has provided the US military in Vietnam with as many as 1,500 kinds of war materials. From ammunition, napalm bombs, communication equipment, petroleum, chemical gases, iron bar nets, jeeps, trucks, to military uniforms, military shoes, blood plasma, and medicines, a full range of military supplies are purchased in Japan. Ninety percent of the napalm bombs dropped in Vietnam come from Japan.
    Japan's aviation industry is repairing damaged US aircraft from the Vietnam battlefield in batches to shorten the repair time. According to US newspapers: "A damaged jet fighter can be transported from South Vietnam by landing craft, repaired, and flown back to fight in a total of only 35 to 45 days. If the damaged jet fighter is transported back to the United States by warship across the Pacific, it will take an additional six to eight weeks." After the oil pipeline at the US naval base in South Vietnam was damaged, new oil pipelines can be quickly transported from Japan to replace them.
    With the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States is eager to obtain more military supplies from Japan. From February 9 to 11, Brick, a senior US Department of Defense official, led a US Department of Defense delegation to Japan to discuss with the Japanese "Defense Agency" the issue of Japan increasing the supply of military materials to the US military in Vietnam in exchange for US Nike-Hercules missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. According to the Akahata on the 11th, the two sides have reached a general agreement on the types and quantities of military materials to be provided by Japan to the United States. In this way, the United States can both arm Japan with nuclear weapons and obtain more weapons from Japan to slaughter the Vietnamese people.
    In addition, according to the May 1965 issue of Unified Korea magazine, the United States and the Park Chung-hee group decided that the equipment of the puppet army division sent to South Vietnam would also be supplied by Japan. After the Sato government came to power, it agreed to provide the South Vietnamese puppet regime with US$9.1 million in "gratuitous aid." On February 8 this year, on the same day that the Honolulu Conference where the United States and the South Vietnamese puppets plotted to expand the war of aggression ended, the Japanese government publicly announced an emergency aid of US$200,000 to the South Vietnamese puppet group at the request of US Vice President Humphrey and the "Honolulu Declaration."
    Providing "Technical" Personnel
    At the same time, the Sato government, at the request of the United States, is also providing technical and labor assistance to the US military in Vietnam. According to the Japanese Peace News published on January 15, the number of Japanese personnel participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam in various forms is increasing sharply. A transportation team composed of more than 20 US landing craft regularly transports weapons, ammunition, and other combat materials from mainland Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan to Vietnam. More than 1,000 Japanese sailors who drive these ships are all recruited with the assistance of the Sato government. Among the sailors on some US transport ships, many are senior officers of the former Japanese Navy. These transport ship sailors are issued weapons and sometimes fight alongside US warships. More than 600 Japanese "technical" personnel work at the US Far East Map Bureau, providing the US Air Force with "technical" data for bombing Vietnam. Currently, the US military is still recruiting a large number of laboratory technicians, engineers, and managers in Japan.
    Japan is also being used by the United States as a hospital center for treating US military personnel injured in Vietnam. US field hospitals in Japan are rapidly expanding and increasing. According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, as of December 20 of last year, there were a total of 1,875 beds in US field hospitals in Japan, and now it has increased to 4,800 beds in order to accommodate the increasing number of wounded US soldiers in Vietnam.
    Making a Fortune from War
    The Japanese Sato government's enthusiastic support for the aggression against Vietnam and its role as an accomplice to the American aggressors are inseparable from the Japanese monopoly capitalists' evil intention to take advantage of the war and seek huge profits. They are gloatingly calling the war of aggression against Vietnam launched by the United States the "second divine wind" to make a fortune from the war after the Korean War, and a "turning point in getting rid of the recession." Japanese arms manufacturers regard the Johnson administration's increase in military spending on Vietnam to US$12 billion in 1966 as the "biggest stimulus." Under the support of US imperialism and the stimulation of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Japanese economy controlled by monopoly capital is turning to militarization, establishing a complete military industry system from guns, ammunition, warships, airplanes to missiles.
    With the "gradual escalation" of the US war of aggression against Vietnam, the military supplies purchased by the United States in Japan have also increased rapidly. "Vietnam special procurements" have become a topic of discussion among Japanese manufacturers every day, and they are looking forward to receiving more special procurement orders. According to incomplete statistics, "Vietnam special procurements" in January 1965 were US$120 million, increased to US$310 million in May, and there was a large increase in June and July. The profit from special procurement orders is greater than that of ordinary exports, and the huge profits obtained by Japanese monopoly capital from the war of aggression against Vietnam have risen sharply. According to the recent Japanese Economist magazine, Japan's military industry is becoming active as an "industry that is growing upward in an economic recession." The stocks of companies related to the military industry are increasing significantly.
    From all the above, it can be seen that the Japanese Sato government is betting Japan's fate on the American war gamble, vainly attempting to rely on the strength of the United States to take advantage of this bloody war of aggression and make a fortune. However, US imperialism is deeply mired in the quagmire of South Vietnam and cannot struggle out. The Sato government's close following of US imperialism can only be shooting oneself in the foot, and there will be no good end.

### 佐藤政府是美国侵越战争的帮凶

    佐藤政府是美国侵越战争的帮凶
    佐藤政府上台一年多来，不惜出卖日本的独立和安全，一贯追随美国的侵略政策和战争政策，把日本紧紧地拴在美国的战车上。美帝国主义正驱使日本反动派为它进一步扩大侵越战争服务；而日本垄断资本家及其代理人则企图趁火打劫，乘机渔利，在这场侵略战争中分一口血食。正如美国副总统汉弗莱最近所说的：“美国需要日本，日本也需要美国。”
    事实上，日本已经成为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的兵工厂和后勤基地。随着约翰逊政府侵越战争的“逐步升级”，日本反动派为美国效劳的范围和规模也逐步扩大。佐藤在最近一次的日本众议院全体会议上更公开叫嚷，日本“应当充分地、完全地、彻底地履行日美安全条约所规定的义务”，“向美国提供基地、允许去越南的美军在日本停留，……完全没有理由阻止。”这说明佐藤政府甘心充当美国侵略越南和整个印度支那的可耻帮凶。
    提供侵略基地
    目前，在日本的许多美国军事基地，都在直接为侵越战争服务。美国的侵略舰队经常从横须贺、佐世保等港口开到南越。仅在东京，就有美国的军事基地和军事设施达二十四处之多。从去年八月以来，美国从东京最大的空军基地横田、立川源源向南越赶运兵员、弹药、武器、医药品和粮食等。在越南狂轰滥炸的美国B—52重型轰炸机，有的就是从横田机场起飞的。在日本南部福冈市附近的板付基地，美军部署了可载核弹的F—105型战术战斗机。到目前为止，美国核潜艇已先后八次闯进日本港口“停泊”。据《朝日新闻》一月十三日透露，佐藤政府已经在原则上决定同意直接参加侵越战争的美国核动力舰队在日本停泊。
    为适应进一步扩大侵越战争的需要，美国正在大规模地扩建冲绳军事基地。岛上现在有十个美军基地已在加紧施工。在冲绳岛，有百分之二十八的土地被美军占用，其中那霸、嘉手纳等中部地区，设有导弹基地、雷达基地和大型飞机场。据最近的《冲绳时报》报道，在全长两千多米的那霸军港，经常可以看到几艘一万四五千吨左右的货轮在码头旁边日夜装卸货物。这里已经成为美国专门向南越前线提供物资的前哨基地。分布在冲绳东海岸的美国海军陆战队，在这里接受军事训练后，便被派到南越去参加血腥的侵略战争。
    供应军火物资
    日本反动派不仅允许美国利用它在日本领土上的军事基地侵略越南，而且还生产大量的武器和军需物资源源供应美国侵略军的需要。去年十二月三十日的《华尔街日报》指出，美国军方
  “已经开始把日本用作进行越南战争的补给基地”，日本“对维持在南越进行的各种军事行动”
  “具有极其重大的作用”。
    据报道，从去年以来，日本向侵越美军提供的战争物资已达一千五百种。从弹药、凝固汽油弹、通讯器材、石油、化学瓦斯、铁条网、吉普车、载重卡车，直到军衣、军鞋、血浆、医药品，全套的军需物资都在日本采购。在越南投下的凝固汽油弹，有百分之九十来自日本。
    日本的航空工业正在成批成批地修理在越南战场上被打坏的美国飞机，以缩短修理时间。据美国报纸报道：“一架被打伤的喷气式飞机，用登陆艇从南越运出来，修好之后飞回去参加战斗，总共只需要三十五天到四十五天。如果用军舰横渡太平洋把打伤的喷气式飞机运回美国则需要多花六个星期到八个星期。”美国在南越海军基地的输油管被破坏后，很快就可以从日本运去新的输油管代替。
    随着侵越战争的扩大，美国正急于从日本得到更多的军需物资。二月九日至十一日，美国国防部高级官员布里克率领美国国防部代表团到日本活动，就日本增加向侵越美军提供军用物资以换取可以带核弹头的美国奈克—赫尔克里士导弹问题，同日本“防卫厅”进行了多次的密谈。据《赤旗报》十一日揭露，这次会谈，双方已经就日本向美国提供军用物资的种类、数量大体上达成协议。这样，美国既可以用核武器把日本武装起来，又可以从日本得到更多的屠杀越南人民的武器。
    此外，据一九六五年五月号《统一朝鲜》杂志揭露，美国和朴正熙集团决定，派到南越的一师傀儡军的装备，也是由日本负责供应的。佐藤政府上台以后，已答应向南越傀儡政权提供九百一十万美元的“无偿援助”。今年二月八日，正当美国和南越傀儡策划扩大侵略战争的檀香山会议结束的同一天，日本政府根据美国副总统汉弗莱的要求和“檀香山宣言”，公开宣布给南越傀儡集团二十万美元紧急援助。
    提供“技术”人员
    与此同时，佐藤政府还根据美国的要求，为侵越美军提供技术和劳务的援助。据一月十五日出版的日本《和平新闻》揭露，以各种形式参加侵越战争的日本人员正在急剧增加。一支由二十多艘美国登陆艇组成的运输队，经常从日本本土、冲绳、菲律宾、泰国和台湾等地，向越南运送武器、弹药和其它作战物资。驾驶这些船只的一千多名日本海员全部是由佐藤政府协助招募的。在一些美国运输舰上的海员中，有不少是日本旧海军的高级人员，这些运输舰的海员被发给武器，有时同美国军舰一起作战。有六百多名日本“技术”人员在美军远东地图局工作，向美国空军提供轰炸越南的“技术”资料。目前，美国军队还在日本大量招募实验室技术人员、工程人员和管理人员。
    日本还被美国利用作为医疗在越南受伤的美军人员的医院中心。在日本的美国野战医院正在迅速扩大和增加。据日本《每日新闻》透露，到去年十二月二十日为止，在日本的美国野战医院共有一千八百七十五张病床，而现在已经增加到四千八百张，以便收容日益增多的美国侵越军伤兵。
    大发战争横财
    日本佐藤政府热心支持侵略越南，充当美国侵略者的帮凶，是与日本垄断资本家企图在这场战争中趁火打劫，谋取高额利润的罪恶目的分不开的。他们得意忘形地把美国发动的侵越战争称为继侵朝战争以后大发战争财的“第二次神风”，是“摆脱萧条的一个转折点”。日本的军火厂商们更把约翰逊政府增加一九六六年侵越军费到一百二十亿美元看作是“最大的刺激”。在美帝国主义的扶植和侵越战争的刺激下，掌握在垄断资本手里的日本经济正在转向军事化，建立起了从枪炮、弹药、军舰、飞机直到导弹的完整军火工业体系。
    随着美国侵越战争的“逐步升级”，美国在日本采购的军需物资也迅速增加。“越南特需”已经成为日本厂商每天议论的问题，他们盼望得到更多的特需订货。据不完全统计，一九六五年一月的“越南特需”是一亿二千万美元，五月增加到三亿一千多万美元，六七月份又有大量的增加。特需订货的利润比平常出口更大，日本垄断资本从侵越战争中获得的巨额利润更是直线上升。据最近的日本《经济学人》杂志报道说，日本的军火工业正在作为“经济萧条中的向上成长着的产业”而活跃起来。与军火工业有关系的企业的股票正在大幅度增长。
    从上述一切可以看出，日本佐藤政府把日本的命运押在美国的战争赌博上，妄图依靠美国的力量，在这场血腥的侵略战争中趁火打劫，大捞一把。但是，美帝国主义已经深陷于南越的泥潭中，无法挣扎出来。佐藤政府紧紧追随美帝国主义，这只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，也不可能有任何好的下场。
