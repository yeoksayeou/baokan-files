    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Committee Concludes Experience and Makes Decision
    A New Era Begins Where Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Directly Master Mao Zedong Thought;
    Party Committees at All Levels Must Vigorously Lead the Movement to Study Chairman Mao's Works
    Comrade Zhou Enlai Attended the Meeting and Delivered an Important Speech. The meeting called on leading cadres at all levels to actively lead the great debate on the relationship between politics and professional work; to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's exposition on democratic centralism and the Central Committee's instructions on strengthening mutual learning and overcoming complacency and arrogance; cadres at the county committee standing committee level and above should go down to the grassroots level to take the lead in grasping the study and application of Chairman Mao's works by party members and the masses.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Committee, at its recent plenary meeting, summarized the experiences of the broad masses and cadres in the North China region in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the previous stage, and made a decision on further strengthening the leadership of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works.
    The decision pointed out that in North China, as in the whole country, a new historical era has begun in which millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly master Mao Zedong Thought. Party committees at all levels, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, should put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, vigorously strengthen the leadership of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, and, like the People's Liberation Army, carry forward a high degree of consciousness, give prominence to politics, and better arm all cadres, all party members, all Communist Youth League members, all militiamen, all workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and all revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, so that the great Mao Zedong Thought truly becomes a thought weapon directly mastered by them, exerts greater power, and makes the cause of socialist revolution and construction develop more smoothly.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the CCP Central Committee, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech.
    This meeting was held in the context of a high tide of study of Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres in various parts of North China. Prior to the meeting, the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of North China held experience exchange meetings on studying Chairman Mao's works, and a large number of activists in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works emerged, resulting in an unprecedentedly enthusiastic mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works throughout the region. This meeting focused on discussing the issue of strengthening the leadership of the movement.
    The meeting pointed out that "Giving prominence to politics means giving prominence to Mao Zedong Thought and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works." This sentence has become a common understanding and a unified action slogan for the broad masses of cadres and the masses. The reason why people are so eagerly and actively studying Chairman Mao's works is not an accidental phenomenon, as Chen Yonggui, Secretary of the Dazhai Party Branch, said: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words will lead us down the right path." Historical experience has proven that the victory of China's New Democratic Revolution, the victory of socialist revolution and construction over the past sixteen years, and the victory of the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Through personal experience, especially the practice of domestic and international class struggle in recent years, and the practice of revolutionary movements in production struggles and scientific experiments, people have gained positive and negative experiences, and they understand more clearly day by day that as long as they advance along the road pointed out by Chairman Mao, they will surely win; if they violate Mao Zedong Thought, they will surely lose their way. In the face of this excellent situation, party committees at all levels should vigorously strengthen the leadership of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, further promote the rapid improvement of the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people, and promote the rapid emergence of a new and greater leap forward on all fronts.
    The meeting believed that in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, leading cadres must take the lead in studying and applying them, and strive to reverse the situation in some places where ordinary cadres lag behind the masses and leading cadres lag behind ordinary cadres in the shortest possible time.
    The meeting pointed out that studying Chairman Mao's works is by no means ordinary reading; it is a profound ideological revolution. Every step forward in this study movement must go through serious and fierce struggles. The mass-based great airing of views, great contending, and great debate on the relationship between politics and professional work that has been launched in many places is an important progress made by the broad masses of cadres and the masses in giving prominence to politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in this study movement. This great debate is full of serious criticism of all kinds of bourgeois ideology by proletarian ideology, making people further realize that all work must be led by politics and Mao Zedong Thought. We must use this great debate to promote proletarian socialist and communist ideology, discredit bourgeois capitalist and modern revisionist ideology; promote dialectical materialist thought, and break down idealist and metaphysical thought; in particular, we must enable everyone to establish a clear class and class struggle thought, recognize that the theory of class struggle in the socialist period is a major development of Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle of Marxism-Leninism; recognize that the class struggle in the transition period is not only long-term, complex, and tortuous, but also permeates all aspects; recognize that the kind of thinking that after engaging in class struggle for a while, everything will be fine, and from then on, we can only focus on production, only focus on professional work, and not focus on politics, is a subjective illusion lacking understanding of the repetitive nature of class struggle. Party committees at all levels, especially leading cadres at all levels, must correctly grasp Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle during the transition period, adhere to the general line of socialist construction, actively lead this great debate, and "put" themselves in it, "reveal" their thoughts, stand at the forefront of the movement, and lead the masses forward.
    The meeting required leading cadres at all levels to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's expositions on democratic centralism and the Central Committee's instructions on strengthening mutual learning and overcoming complacency and arrogance. The meeting believed that these are two fundamental documents that leading cadres must read and have extremely important educational significance for leading cadres at all levels in the North China region. The implementation of democratic centralism must go through serious education and be carried out repeatedly over a long period of time. The North China Bureau and the party committees of its subordinate provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions must first set an example, and leading cadres at all levels must combine a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralism in light of their own actual situations, adhere to the mass line, and fully develop the party's combat effectiveness. Party committees at all levels must discuss the Central Committee's instructions on strengthening mutual learning and overcoming complacency and arrogance at least once a year, and leading cadres at all levels should deeply understand the far-reaching significance of this document, and, like the people of Dazhai, "stand on Mount Taihang and look out at the whole world." The tide of history has pushed us onto the world stage, and we should stand at the forefront of the trend of the times, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and demand the highest standards of ourselves.
    The meeting proposed that in the process of implementing the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, leading cadres at all levels should directly use the party's line, principles, and policies to mobilize the masses and carry out work; at the same time, they should truly follow the mass line, go deep into reality, seriously squat at points, investigate and study, and dissect "sparrows." Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, they should be good at combining Chairman Mao's works with the transformation of the thinking and work of cadres in their regions and departments, and constantly transform their own subjective world while transforming the objective world.
    The meeting called on cadres at the county committee standing committee level and above to go down to the grassroots level to take the lead in grasping the study of party members and the masses and arm grassroots cadres and party members with Mao Zedong Thought. After three to five years of effort, grassroots party branches should become Dazhai-style branches, combat fortresses armed with Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely taking the socialist and communist road. In order to achieve this goal, the meeting made the following provisions:
    1. Leading cadres who go down to the grassroots level shall be responsible for checking the situation and problems of grassroots party members and the masses in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and checking the organization and leadership of the branch for learning.
    2. Every leading cadre should, without exception, give party lectures to all party members of the grassroots branch, and can also give League lectures to League members. In addition to lecturing, they should also be responsible for answering questions or providing key guidance to the study of party and League members.
    3. On the basis of studying Chairman Mao's works, leading cadres should help grassroots cadres, party members, and the masses conduct investigations and research together, analyze the actual problems of their departments, units, villages, and teams, and help them summarize experiences, establish models, and further promote them.
    The meeting believed that doing so would fundamentally change the ideological style of leading cadres at all levels, so that they would not only focus on production, professional work, and technology when they went to the grassroots level, leaving politics aside; but would first focus on politics, ideology, and the study of Chairman Mao's works. Highlighting this point can drive other tasks, drive the overall situation, and bring out a group of people.
    This meeting was held in Tianjin from the 12th to the 16th. The meeting also discussed issues such as industrial and agricultural production and economic construction. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Li Xuefeng, First Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, made a concluding speech on the above issues, especially on giving prominence to politics, studying Chairman Mao's works, the socialist education movement, and striving to change the backward face of the North China region in a short period of time.

    中共中央华北局委员会全体会议总结经验作出决定
    工农兵直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代开始了
    各级党委要大力领导学习毛主席著作的运动
    周恩来同志参加了会议，并作了重要讲话。会议号召各级领导干部积极领导政治与业务的关系问题的大辩论；认真学习毛主席关于民主集中制的论述和中央关于加强相互学习、克服固步自封、骄傲自满的指示；县委常委以上干部下到基层去，带头抓好党员和群众活学活用毛主席著作。
    新华社十八日讯　中共中央华北局委员会在最近举行的全体会议上，总结了前一阶段华北地区广大群众和干部活学活用毛主席著作的经验，作出了关于进一步加强对学习毛主席著作运动的领导的决定。
    这个决定指出，在华北，和在全国一样，千百万工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的历史新时代已经开始了。各级党委，特别是县以上各级领导干部，应该把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，大力加强对学习毛主席著作的群众运动的领导，要象解放军那样，发扬高度的自觉性，突出政治，更好地用毛泽东思想武装全体干部、全体党员、全体共青团员、全体民兵、全体工人和贫农下中农积极分子、全体革命的群众，让伟大的毛泽东思想，真正成为他们直接掌握的思想武器，发挥更大的威力，使社会主义革命和建设事业更加顺利地向前发展。
    中共中央副主席周恩来同志参加了这次会议，并作了重要讲话。
    这次会议是在华北各地广大工农兵群众和干部学习毛主席著作高潮的情况下召开的。在会议以前，华北各省、市、自治区分别举行了学习毛主席著作的经验交流会议，涌现出大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，在全区范围内出现了一个空前热烈的学习毛主席著作的群众运动。这次会议着重讨论了加强运动的领导问题。
    会议指出，“突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想、活学活用毛主席著作”，这句话已经成为广大干部和群众的共同认识和一致行动的口号。人们所以这样如饥似渴地积极学习毛主席著作，不是一种偶然的现象，正如大寨党支部书记陈永贵说的：“听毛主席的话，路子就走不差。”历史的经验证明，中国新民主主义革命的胜利，十六年来社会主义革命和建设的胜利，反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对各国反动派的斗争的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。人们通过切身的体验，特别是近几年来经历了国内外阶级斗争的实践，经过生产斗争和科学实验的革命运动的实践，有了正面的和反面的经验，他们就一天比一天更清楚地懂得，只要按照毛主席指引的道路前进，就一定胜利；要是违背了毛泽东思想，就一定会迷失方向。在这个大好形势面前，各级党委应该大力加强对学习毛主席著作的群众运动的领导，进一步推动广大人民群众的社会主义觉悟迅速提高，推动各个战线上新的更大跃进的局面迅速出现。
    会议认为，在学习毛主席著作的运动中，领导干部必须带头学，带头用，要在最短期间，努力扭转有些地方存在的一般干部落后于群众、领导干部又落后于一般干部的状况。
    会议指出，学习毛主席著作，决不同于平常的读书，这是一场深刻的思想革命。这个学习运动的每一步前进，都要经过严重激烈的斗争。目前许多地方围绕着政治和业务的关系问题掀起的一场群众性的大鸣大放大辩论，是广大干部和群众在这次学习运动中突出政治活学活用毛主席著作的一个重要进展。这场大辩论，充满着无产阶级思想对于形形色色的资产阶级思想的严肃批判，使人们进一步认识到一切工作必须以政治为统帅，以毛泽东思想为统帅。我们要通过这场大辩论，大兴无产阶级的社会主义和共产主义思想，搞臭资产阶级的资本主义和现代修正主义思想；要大立辩证唯物主义的思想，大破唯心主义的形而上学思想；特别是要使每个人都能够树立起明确的阶级和阶级斗争的思想，认识到社会主义时期的阶级斗争学说，是毛主席对于马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争理论的重大发展；认识到过渡时期的阶级斗争，不只是长期的、复杂的、曲折的，而且是贯串各个方面的；认识到那种以为搞过一阵子阶级斗争以后，就万事大吉，从此可以只抓生产、只抓业务、不抓政治的思想，是对阶级斗争的反复性缺乏认识的主观幻想。各级党委，特别是各级领导干部，必须正确掌握毛主席关于过渡时期阶级斗争的学说，坚持社会主义建设总路线，积极领导这场大辩论，并且要把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，站在运动的最前面，领导群众前进。
    会议要求各级领导干部，认真学习毛主席关于民主集中制的论述和中央关于加强相互学习、克服固步自封、骄傲自满的指示。会议认为，这是领导干部必读的两个根本性文件，对华北地区的各级领导干部有极其重要的教育意义。贯彻执行民主集中制，必须经过认真的教育，并且长期反复进行。华北局和所属各省、市、自治区党委要首先作出示范，各级领导干部要联系自己的实际情况，做到高度民主和高度集中相结合，坚持群众路线，充分发扬党的战斗力。各级党委每年至少要讨论一次中央关于加强相互学习、克服固步自封、骄傲自满的指示，各级领导干部应该深刻领会这个文件的深远意义，要象大寨人那样，“站在太行山，眼望全世界”。历史的浪潮已经把我们推上了世界舞台，我们就应该站到时代潮流的最前面，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，用最高的标准要求自己。
    会议提出，各级领导干部在贯彻执行毛主席和党中央指示的过程中，要把党的路线、方针、政策，直接用于发动群众，开展工作；同时，要真正走群众路线，深入实际，认真蹲点，调查研究，解剖“麻雀”。应该象焦裕禄同志那样，善于把毛主席著作同改造本地区、本部门干部的思想和工作结合起来，在改造客观世界的同时，不断地改造自己的主观世界。
    会议号召县委常委以上的干部下到基层去，带头抓好党员和群众的学习，用毛泽东思想武装基层干部和党员。经过三年五年的努力使基层党支部成为大寨式的支部，成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的、坚决走社会主义和共产主义道路的战斗堡垒。为了达到这个目的，会议作出如下的规定：
    一、下到基层的领导干部，要负责检查基层党员和群众活学活用毛主席著作的情况和问题，检查支部对于学习的组织领导。
    二、每一个领导干部，应该没有例外地给基层支部的全体党员讲党课，同时还可以给共青团员讲团课。除了讲课以外，也应该负责解答问题，或者对党团员的学习做重点辅导。
    三、在学习毛主席著作的基础上，领导干部应该帮助基层干部、党员和群众，共同进行调查研究，分析本部门、本单位、本村、本队的实际问题，并且帮助他们总结经验，树立样板，进一步加以推广。
    会议认为，这样做，就会从根本上改变各级领导干部的思想作风，不是一到基层就只抓生产、业务、技术，把政治丢在一边；而是首先抓政治、抓思想，抓好对毛主席著作的学习。突出这一点，就可以带动其他各项工作，带动全局，带出一班人来。
    这次会议在十二日至十六日在天津举行。会议还讨论了工农业生产和经济建设等方面的问题。会议结束的时候，中共中央华北局第一书记李雪峰同志就上述问题，特别是就突出政治、学习毛主席著作、社会主义教育运动和争取在不长时间内改变华北地区落后面貌的问题，作了总结发言。
