The Japanese people are welcoming the "Great Unified Action" with a combat stance. The Japanese Communist Party calls for the successful implementation of the unified action to counter the invasion plots of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and five other organizations send a telegram congratulating the Japanese people on the success of the "Great Unified Action."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, Tokyo: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party published a statement in the March 17th issue of the "Red Flag" newspaper, exposing and condemning the Sato government's scheme, under the directive of the United States, to dispatch the "Self-Defense Forces" to Okinawa and to make the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" permanent.

The statement points out that Japanese Prime Minister Sato said in the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors on March 10th that "if Okinawa is attacked by armed forces, Japan will defend Okinawa together with the U.S. military," which once again exposed the Japanese government's intention to send troops to Okinawa.

The statement reveals that, in fact, the "Self-Defense Forces" have already been dispatched to Okinawa under the pretext of "inspection tours." Sato's statement on March 16th in the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that "as long as the United States still holds administrative power in Okinawa, Japan cannot exercise 'self-defense rights' to dispatch troops to Okinawa" is a lie.

The statement emphasizes that U.S. imperialism, while turning Okinawa into a bastion for ruling and suppressing the Japanese people, is also using Okinawa as a base to wage the Vietnam War and to provoke wars against China, Korea, and other Asian countries.

The statement says that Sato and Etsusaburo Uchiyama recently advocated in the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors to make this treaty permanent, indicating that the Sato government is trying to strengthen and fully cooperate with U.S. imperialism's aggression against Asia and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' suppression and rule over the Japanese people.

The statement points out, "Prime Minister Sato's series of speeches have exposed the reactionary policy and essence of Japan's government in closely following the United States and reviving militarism, which is also a serious manifestation of actively implementing the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and the 'Japan-Korea Treaty.' It is a serious challenge to the Japanese people and the people of Asia who are fighting for independence, peace, and security."

The statement calls on all members of the Japanese Communist Party and politically conscious democratic forces to continue to uphold the fighting spirit and strive to successfully carry out the large-scale "March 20th" unified action.

The statement appeals to the Japanese working class and people from all walks of life to raise higher the banner of struggling for independence, peace, neutrality, and improving living standards, to oppose the Sato government's policy of following the United States and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' line of reviving militarism, and calls on all democratic forces and people from all walks of life in Japan to unite and fight to overthrow the reactionary Sato cabinet and dissolve the Diet.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and five other organizations sent a telegram on the 18th to the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese movement to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to achieve various demands, warmly congratulating the Japanese people on the success of the "National Great Unified Action" to be held in Tokyo on March 20th to realize various demands.

The other people's organizations that signed the telegram are: the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation.

This national great unified action of the Japanese people is centered on opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam and opposing the visit of the puppet Prime Minister of South Vietnam, Nguyen Cao Ky, to Japan. The central rally of this unified action, scheduled to be held in Tokyo on the 20th, is expected to attract 200,000 participants.

The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and other organizations stated in the telegram that they pay high respects and combat salutes to the Japanese people who are standing on the front line of the struggle against U.S. imperialism. The telegram says: "At a time when U.S. imperialism is crazily expanding its aggression in Vietnam on one hand and playing the 'peace talks' trick on the other, its accomplices are actively scheming and running errands for it. We believe that your launching of this powerful mass movement will definitely play an important role in further mobilizing and uniting the Japanese people from all walks of life, strengthening the struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and against the Sato government's following of U.S. imperialism; it will provide new and powerful support and cooperation to the Vietnamese people and all people around the world who are fighting against imperialism and for national liberation; it will make new contributions to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

"The just struggle of the Japanese people has the firm support of the people of Asia and the world. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the struggle of the Japanese people, and are willing to unite more closely with the Japanese people to fight to the end against the aggressive policy, war policy, and nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat policy of U.S. imperialism, to smash all the plots of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and to defend peace in Asia and the world."

    日本人民以战斗姿态迎接“大统一行动”
    日共号召开展好统一行动反击美日反动派侵略阴谋
    我和委会等五团体电祝日本人民“大统一行动”成功
    据新华社十七日讯  东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会政治局在十七日的《赤旗报》上发表声明，揭露和谴责佐藤政府秉承美国意旨，阴谋向冲绳派遣“自卫队”和使日美“安全条约”长期固定化。
    声明指出，日本首相佐藤在三月十日的参议院预算委员会上说什么“一旦冲绳遭到武装攻击，日本将同美军共同保卫冲绳”，这再次暴露了日本政府要派兵到冲绳去的企图。
    声明揭露，事实上，“自卫队”已经在“视察旅行”的借口下，被派遣到冲绳去了。佐藤三月十六日在参议院预算委员会说什么只要美国在冲绳还掌握行政权，日本不能对冲绳“行使‘自卫权’出动军队”的话是骗人的。
    声明强调说，美帝国主义在把冲绳变成它统治和镇压日本人民的堡垒的同时，还以冲绳为基地进行侵越战争，并向中国、朝鲜和亚洲其他国家进行战争挑衅。
    声明说，佐藤和椎名悦三郎最近在参议院预算委员会上，公开主张把这一条约长期固定下来，这表明佐藤政府企图巩固并且全力配合美帝国主义侵略亚洲的体制以及加强美日反动派镇压和统治日本人民的体制。
    声明指出，“佐藤首相的一系列的讲话，暴露了日本政府加紧追随美国和复活军国主义这一反动政策的目的和实质，这也是积极执行日美‘安全条约’和实施‘日韩条约’的严重表现，是对正在为争取独立、和平与安全而战斗的日本人民和亚洲人民的严重挑战。”
    声明号召日本共产党全体党员和有政治觉悟的民主力量继续发扬战斗精神，力争开展好大规模的“三月二十日”统一行动。
    声明呼吁日本工人阶级和各界人士更高地举起争取独立、和平、中立和提高生活水平的旗帜，反对佐藤政府追随美国以及美日反动派推行的复活军国主义的路线，号召一切民主力量和日本各界人民同心协力为推翻反动的佐藤内阁和解散国会而斗争。
    据新华社十九日讯中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等五团体十八日在联名发给日本废除日美“安全条约”和争取实现各种要求中央执行委员会的一份电报中，热烈预祝日本人民三月二十日将在东京举行的“实现各项要求全国大统一行动”中央集会获得成功。
    在电报上签署的其他人民团体是：中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会和中华全国青年联合会。
    日本人民的这次全国大统一行动是以反对美国侵略越南、反对南越伪总理阮高其访问日本为中心。这次统一行动二十日在东京举行的中央集会，预计有二十万人参加。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等团体在电报中向站在反对美帝国主义斗争前线的日本人民致崇高的、战斗的敬意，电报说：“正当美帝国主义在越南一手疯狂扩大侵略战争、一手大肆玩弄‘和谈’阴谋，它的合伙者也积极为之筹谋划策、奔走效劳的时候，我们相信，你们再一次开展这次强大的群众性运动，定将对进一步广泛地动员和团结日本各阶层人民，加强反对美帝国主义侵略越南和反对佐藤政府追随美帝国主义的斗争，起重要的作用；对越南人民和全世界一切为反对帝国主义和争取民族解放而斗争的人民，给予新的有力支持和配合；对保卫亚洲和世界和平，作出新的贡献。
    “日本人民的正义斗争，受到亚洲和全世界人民的坚决支持。中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持日本人民的斗争，并愿同日本人民更紧密地团结，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策、战争政策和核讹诈、核威胁政策，为粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的一切阴谋活动，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底。”
