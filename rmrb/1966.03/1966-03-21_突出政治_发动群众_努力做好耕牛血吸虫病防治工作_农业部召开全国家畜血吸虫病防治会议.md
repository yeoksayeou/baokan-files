    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th -- The National Conference on the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis in Livestock, recently convened by the Ministry of Agriculture in Shanghai, discussed the issue of how to emphasize politics and do a good job in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in draught cattle.
    In the past two years, the nationwide schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work has progressed rapidly, and work such as treating patients, eliminating snails, managing manure, and managing water use has become increasingly thorough. Under these circumstances, various localities have requested further prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock. Because schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that can infect both humans and animals, if only humans are treated and not livestock, the disease cannot be completely eliminated; moreover, draught cattle have more opportunities to contract the disease, and if they contract schistosomiasis, they will weaken or lose their ability to work, affecting agricultural production.
    The attendees of the conference conscientiously studied the relevant instructions from the Party and Chairman Mao and analyzed the current situation of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work. Everyone believed that the Party committees in various localities are paying close attention to schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work, the masses have a very strong desire to eliminate schistosomiasis, and relevant departments have accumulated many prevention and treatment experiences. However, completely eliminating this disease is a long-term, complex, and arduous task, and persistent and unyielding struggle must be carried out. The representatives unanimously agreed that the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock must emphasize politics, use politics to command professional work, keep up with the current situation and pace of the national schistosomiasis prevention and treatment movement; in the prevention and treatment work, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the masses, implement the class viewpoint, the production viewpoint, and the mass viewpoint, cooperate closely with the health departments, uniformly arrange tasks, and first do a good job in checking and treating sick cattle and safely grazing and managing livestock manure.
    The conference exchanged experiences in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock in various localities and introduced four models of self-reliance in running livestock schistosomiasis prevention and treatment undertakings. The four models are: An County and Mianzhu County in Sichuan Province, Dangyang in Hubei Province, and Yushan County in Jiangxi Province. The prevention and treatment conditions in these four counties are relatively poor, but they put "doing" first, fully mobilized the masses, inspected a large number of draught cattle, and treated a large number of sick cattle, with recent treatment effects reaching about 90 percent. This work was carried out under the guidance of the technical personnel of the county animal husbandry and veterinary stations, mainly relying on the veterinarians of the commune animal husbandry and veterinary stations and the rural non-detached disease prevention personnel. Now, through practice, these prevention and treatment personnel in these four counties have become the basic force in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock.
    This National Conference on the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis in Livestock was held at the end of February this year. More than 60 animal husbandry and veterinary personnel and representatives from relevant agricultural scientific research units from twelve provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the south attended the conference.

    突出政治　发动群众
    努力做好耕牛血吸虫病防治工作
    农业部召开全国家畜血吸虫病防治会议
    新华社上海二十日电　农业部最近在上海召开的全国家畜血吸虫病防治会议，讨论了如何突出政治，做好耕牛血吸虫病防治工作的问题。
    近两年来，全国展开的血吸虫病防治工作进展很快，治疗病人、消灭钉螺、管理粪便、管理用水等工作越来越深入。在这种情况下，各地要求进一步防治家畜血吸虫病。因为血吸虫病是人、畜都可以感染的寄生虫病，如果只治人，不治牲畜，这种病就不能彻底消灭；而且耕牛得病机会多，得了血吸虫病就会减弱或丧失役用能力，影响农业生产。
    出席会议的人员认真学习了党和毛主席的有关指示，分析了当前血吸虫病防治工作的形势。大家认为，各地党委对血吸虫病防治工作抓得很紧，群众对消灭血吸虫病的要求十分强烈，有关部门积累了许多防治经验。但是彻底消灭这种病是一个长期、复杂、艰巨的任务，必须坚持不懈地作反复顽强的斗争。代表们一致认为，家畜血吸虫病防治工作，必须突出政治，以政治统帅业务，跟上当前全国血吸虫病防治运动的形势和步伐；在防治工作中要坚决依靠群众，贯彻阶级观点、生产观点、群众观点，与卫生部门密切协作，统一安排任务，首先做好查治病牛和安全放牧、管好牲畜粪便等工作。
    会上交流了各地防治家畜血吸虫病的经验，介绍了四个自力更生办家畜血吸虫病防治事业的样板。这四个样板是：四川省的安县和绵竹县，湖北省的当阳，江西省的玉山县。这四个县的防治条件都比较差，但是他们“干”字当头，充分发动群众，检查了大量耕牛，治疗了大批病牛，近期治疗效果达到百分之九十左右。这些工作是在县畜牧兽医站技术人员的指导下，主要依靠公社畜牧兽医站的兽医和农村不脱产的防疫人员进行的。现在这四个县的这些防治人员经过实践，已成为家畜血吸虫病防治工作的基本力量。
    这次全国家畜血吸虫病防治会议是在今年二月底举行的。参加会议的有南方十二个省、市、自治区的畜牧兽医工作人员和有关农业科学研究单位的代表六十多人。
