    The More Rampant the Reactionaries, the Closer They are to Their Doom
    Xiang Donghui
    Comrade Mao Zedong said during the War of Resistance Against Japan: "The rampant nature of all internal and external dark forces has created national disasters; but this rampant nature not only indicates that these dark forces still have power, but also indicates their final struggle, indicating that the masses of the people are gradually approaching victory." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong not only made a scientific prediction of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also revealed a universal law of the reactionary forces moving towards destruction.
    In human history, all reactionary forces must attack revolutionary forces and the masses of the people, and must "eat people." The closer they are to their demise, the more desperately they struggle; the more they are at the end of their rope, the more rampant their counterattacks become. And when their attacks on revolutionary forces and the masses of the people are most rampant, when they "eat people" the most, it is the time when they are accelerating towards their doom. This law has been repeatedly proven by historical facts, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.
    In the 1930s, Hitler came to the political stage in Germany. As soon as Hitler came to power, he fabricated the Reichstag fire incident, arrested the German Communist leader Ernst Thälmann, declared the Communist Party illegal, and at the same time put forward the slogan "Guns instead of butter," nakedly demanding the establishment of a "Greater German Reich." Then, armed intervention in Spain, annexation of Austria, seizure of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, until the outbreak of World War II. After Hitler occupied fourteen European countries, he became even more dizzy and launched a full-scale attack on the Soviet Union. His arrogance reached its peak. However, it was precisely from this moment that Hitler began to move towards his final collapse.
    In 1937, when Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression against China, it was also extremely frantic. Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama brazenly said that the war could be ended in just two months. Later, Japanese imperialism was caught in the quagmire of a long-term war in China and could not extricate itself, and suffered heavy blows from the Chinese people. Then, it further expanded its military aggression to Southeast Asia and launched the Pacific War. Japanese imperialism precisely brought about its complete defeat through this frantic aggression.
    The history of the Kuomintang reactionaries in China moving towards destruction is also like this. In July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, ignoring all peace proposals from the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, frantically launched a nationwide civil war. He relied on his four million military forces and the backing of the big boss, American imperialism, and clamored to "solve the problem" in three to six months. On October 11, 1946, the Kuomintang army occupied Zhangjiakou, and that afternoon Chiang Kai-shek impatiently ordered the convening of a puppet "National Assembly." Then, he drove away the representative offices of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places, and launched a large-scale attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and occupied Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's tail was wagging in the sky, thinking that his reactionary rule could be as stable as Mount Tai from then on. However, the time when Chiang Kai-shek was high-spirited was the day he began to have bad luck. Under the heavy blows of the Chinese people's iron fist, the reactionary rule of the Chiang family dynasty collapsed even faster than people expected.
    Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "When looking at things, one must look at their essence, and only regard their phenomena as a guide to entry. Once inside the door, one must grasp their essence."
    From the phenomenon, the rampant nature of imperialism and reactionaries seems to indicate that they are very powerful; but from the essence, this precisely reflects their weakness. If imperialism and reactionaries could rule steadily, they certainly would not need to go crazy. It is precisely when imperialism and reactionaries encounter insurmountable political and economic crises, when they face the revolutionary upsurge of the masses of the people and feel that their throne is unstable, or when their trick of playing the peace deception has failed, that they will launch a frantic attack on the masses of the people, or launch a frantic aggression abroad. Therefore, no matter from which situation, the rampant nature of imperialism and reactionaries does not show that they are truly powerful, but that they are not powerful; it does not show that they have a solution, but that they have no solution.
    Imperialism and reactionaries always think that launching a frantic attack on revolutionary forces and the masses of the people can overwhelm the people's power, eliminate revolutionary struggles, get rid of their predicament, and save themselves from destruction. However, the development of things has gone in exactly the opposite direction to their wishes. This is the dialectic of historical development.
    The more rampant imperialism and reactionaries are, the more thoroughly their reactionary features are exposed, the faster the awareness of the masses of the people is raised, and the greater the revolutionary forces develop. In the final analysis, the rampant nature of imperialism and reactionaries will only create a more powerful opposite, creating a force to bury themselves. Hitler, Japanese imperialism, and the Chiang family dynasty, didn't they all create their own gravediggers and walk into the grave in this way?
    The capital of imperialism and reactionaries is always limited, and they have insurmountable weaknesses. The more rampant they are, the faster their bet is lost, and the more their inherent weaknesses are deepened and expanded, thereby promoting their own demise. There was a great contradiction between the strength and ambitions of Hitler, Japanese imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. They all had serious weaknesses in politics, military affairs, and economy. And when they were most rampant, the contradiction between their strength and ambitions became even more acute, their weaknesses became more prominent, and became incurable diseases. They all died of these incurable diseases.
    Imperialism and reactionaries are always making mistakes; the more rampant they are, the more they will make bigger mistakes. In this way, their doomsday will inevitably come faster. Hitler, Japanese imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries all made the biggest mistakes when they were most rampant, and jumped into the traps they set themselves.
    Today's American imperialism is the most arrogant and rampant aggressor in history. Its appetite is bigger than anyone else's, and its hands stretch farther than anyone else's. It runs around like a beast. Today it interferes in this country, tomorrow it subverts that country. Today it sends troops to this region, tomorrow it carries out aggression in that region. American imperialism thinks it is very capable, and feels that "there is no one in the world who can do anything to me." In fact, like all reactionaries in history, its rampant nature can only accelerate its own demise. American imperialism is an enemy of the people of the world, mobilizing the people of the world to surround itself, and the noose around its neck is more than any imperialism in history. American imperialism wants to dominate the world, and its weaknesses of having too long a front, insufficient troops, and too far a rear are more serious than those of past aggressors. In Vietnam and other parts of the world, American imperialism is not only repeating the mistakes of other imperialisms, but also making more mistakes than them. No matter how much American imperialism bares its fangs and claws, its demise is inevitable.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If the American monopoly capital group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be sentenced to hanging by the people of the world one day." The rampant aggression activities carried out by American imperialism in various parts of the world are just making great efforts to accelerate the arrival of this day.

### 反动派越猖狂越接近灭亡

    反动派越猖狂越接近灭亡
    向东辉
    毛泽东同志在抗日战争时期说过：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”在这里，毛泽东同志不仅对抗日战争的胜利作出了科学的预言，而且揭示了反动势力走向灭亡的一条普遍规律。
    在人类历史上，凡属反动的势力总是要向革命势力和人民群众进攻的，总是要“吃人”的。他们越是临近灭亡，就越要拼命挣扎；越是日暮途穷，就越要猖狂反扑。而当他们对革命势力和人民群众的进攻最猖狂的时候，当他们“吃人”最多的时候，也就是他们加速走向灭亡的时候。这一条规律，是古今中外的历史事实所反复证明了的。
    二十世纪三十年代，希特勒登上了德国的政治舞台。希特勒一上台，就制造国会纵火事件，逮捕德国共产党领袖台尔曼，宣布共产党非法，同时提出“大炮代替黄油”的口号，赤裸裸地要求建立“伟大的德意志帝国”。接着，武装干涉西班牙，吞并奥地利，攫取捷克的苏台德区，直至发动第二次世界大战。当希特勒占领了欧洲十四个国家以后，他就更加冲昏了头脑，悍然向苏联举行全面进攻。其气焰之嚣张，达于极点。但是，也正是从这个时候开始，希特勒走向最后崩溃。
    一九三七年，当日本帝国主义发动全面侵华战争的时候，也是疯狂得很。日本陆相杉山大言不惭地说，只需两个月就可以结束战争。后来，日本帝国主义在中国陷入长期战争的泥沼而不能自拔，并且遭到中国人民的沉重打击。接着，它进一步把军事侵略扩大到东南亚，发动了太平洋战争。日本帝国主义恰恰就是通过这种疯狂的侵略而使自己遭到彻底失败。
    中国的蒋介石反动派走向覆灭的历史，也是这样。一九四六年七月，蒋介石不顾中国共产党和中国人民的一切和平建议，丧心病狂地发动全国规模的内战。他自恃有四百万军事力量，有美帝国主义大老板作靠山，扬言要在三个月至六个月内“解决问题”。一九四六年十月十一日，国民党军占领了张家口，当天下午蒋介石就迫不及待地下令召开伪“国民大会”。接着，就赶走中共驻南京、上海、重庆等地代表机关，大举进攻陕甘宁边区并占领延安。蒋介石的尾巴翘上了天，以为从此他的反动统治可以安如泰山了。但是，蒋介石趾高气扬之时，正是他开始大倒其霉之日。在中国人民的铁拳沉重打击之下，蒋家王朝的反动统治比人们的预料更快地土崩瓦解了。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质”。
    从现象上看，帝国主义和反动派的猖獗，好象表明他们强大得很；但从本质上看，这恰恰反映了他们的虚弱。如果帝国主义和反动派能够安安稳稳地统治下去，他们当然是不需要发疯的。帝国主义和反动派正是在他们遇到不可克服的政治和经济危机的时候，在他们面对人民群众的革命怒潮而感到自己的宝座不稳的时候，或者是在他们玩弄和平欺骗的一手已经失灵的时候，他们就要对人民群众发动猖狂的进攻，或者对国外发动猖狂的侵略。因此，不论是从哪一种情况来看，帝国主义和反动派的猖獗，都不是说明他们真正有力量，而是说明他们没有力量；不是说明他们有办法，而是说明他们没有办法。
    帝国主义和反动派总以为发动对革命势力和人民群众的猖狂进攻，就可以压倒人民力量，消灭革命斗争，摆脱自己的困境，挽救自己的灭亡。但是，事情的发展正好走到他们的愿望的反面。这是历史发展的辩证法。
    帝国主义和反动派越是猖獗，他们的反动面目就暴露得越彻底，人民群众的觉悟就提高得越快，革命的力量就发展得越大。归根结底，帝国主义和反动派的猖獗，只会造成一个更强大的对立物，造成一个埋葬自己的力量。希特勒、日本帝国主义、蒋家王朝，不都是这样创造了自己的掘墓人，而走进坟墓的吗？
    帝国主义和反动派的本钱总是有限的，而且有着不可克服的弱点。他们越是猖狂，他们的赌本就输得越快，他们的固有弱点就越要加深和扩大，从而促进了自己的灭亡。希特勒、日本帝国主义、蒋介石反动派的力量同他们的野心之间，就都存在着很大的矛盾。他们无论在政治上、军事上、经济上，都有着严重的弱点。而当他们最猖狂的时候，他们的力量同野心之间矛盾就更加尖锐，他们的弱点就更加突出，并且成为不治的绝症。他们都是带着这种绝症而寿终正寝的。
    帝国主义和反动派总是要不断犯错误的；他们越是猖狂，就越要犯更大的错误。这样，也就必然要使他们的末日更快地来临。希特勒、日本帝国主义、蒋介石反动派，就都是在他们最猖狂的时候，犯了最大的错误，而自己跳进自己设下的陷阱。
    今天的美帝国主义是历史上最狂妄、最猖狂的侵略者。它的胃口比谁都大，它的手伸得比谁都长。它象一头野兽一样到处乱窜。今天干涉这个国家，明天颠覆那个国家。今天在这个地区出兵，明天在那个地区进行侵略。美帝国主义自以为十分了得，觉得“天下莫予毒焉”。其实，同历史上的一切反动派一样，它的猖狂也只能是加速自己的灭亡。美帝国主义与全世界人民为敌，动员了全世界人民起来包围自己，它脖子上套的绞索比历史上任何一个帝国主义都多。美帝国主义要称霸全球，它的战线太长、兵力不足、后方太远的弱点，比过去的侵略者更加严重。美帝国主义在越南和世界其他地区，不但重复着别的帝国主义的错误，而且犯着比它们更多的错误。美帝国主义不管怎样张牙舞爪，它的灭亡是不可避免的。
    毛泽东同志说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。”美帝国主义在世界各地所进行的猖狂侵略活动，不过是为了这一天的加速到来而大卖力气罢了。
