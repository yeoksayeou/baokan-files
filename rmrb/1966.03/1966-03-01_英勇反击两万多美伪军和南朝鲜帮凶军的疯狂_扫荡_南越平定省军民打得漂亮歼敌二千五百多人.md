    新华社河内二十八日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省军民在英勇反击两万多名美国侵略军、南越伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军的“扫荡”的战斗中，取得了重大胜利。据初步统计，从一月二十七日到二月十一日，共歼灭敌人二千三百多名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军一千五百多名，击落、击伤和炸毁各种类型的飞机一百五十架。
    在这次反“扫荡”战斗中，平定省军民打得非常漂亮，使这个由美国第一骑兵师发动的所谓“捣碎机攻势”（后改称为“白翼攻势”）遭到沉重打击。
    新华社河内二十七日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省军民，在二月十二日的反“扫荡”战斗中，粉碎了南朝鲜帮凶军五个连的进攻，歼灭敌人二百多名。
    这一天，由美国侵略者指挥的五连南朝鲜帮凶军，对平溪县平安乡的安荣等四个村进行“扫荡”，到处烧杀掳掠，无恶不作。平定省地方部队和游击队决心为受害同胞报仇。他们连夜向敌人进行了猛烈的反击，当场打死南朝鲜帮凶军一百九十一名，打伤十五名，幸存的敌军于十三日凌晨逃窜。
    新华社河内二十六日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省永盛、怀仁和怀安三个县的游击队，在到二月四日为止的一个月内，用步枪打落了美国飞机十三架，打伤三架。被打落的美国飞机上的美国侵略者三十二人都死了。
    其中，永盛县游击队从一月五日到二十七日，共打落了美国直升飞机六架和侦察机一架，打伤了另两架。
    新华社河内二十六日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡附近新安、堤岸地区军民，在今年一月份主动打击敌人，先后同敌人进行了一百六十三次战斗，共歼灭敌人一千七百一十九名，其中有七百二十九名美国侵略军及其仆从军。此外，在新安、堤岸军民的胜利声势下，有一千一百六十九名伪军士兵开小差。
    这是新安、堤岸军民歼敌最多的一个月。其中最突出的是德惠、德和两县军民在今年年初进行的第一场反“扫荡”战斗中，一举歼灭敌人九百多名，其中有七百二十九名美军和仆从军。此外，新安、堤岸军民还夷平了敌人五十所兵营，击毁一零五毫米口径大炮一门，击毁和击伤M—113型两栖装甲车八辆，击落各种飞机十三架，缴获武器一百多件。
    新安、堤岸军民在这期间还捣毁了十个“战略村”，解放了芹德县的龙友乡，使一万一千人民获得了解放。
    与此同时，新安、堤岸人民还进行了一万九千多人次参加的反对伪政权迫害人民的政治斗争。
    新华社河内二十八日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，一月二十四日，越南南方解放武装力量用迫击炮击毁了美国岘港空军基地和诺曼机场的两架B—57轰炸机和七架直升飞机。
    这次袭击还击毁美军四辆军车，地堡四座和好几所兵营，打死打伤许多敌军。
