    Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: Mr. Li Zongren recently visited Guangdong and Guangxi for over two months. When discussing the tremendous achievements in socialist construction in these two regions, he praised: "Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, always prioritizing the interests of the people, can such achievements be made. This trip back home has given me a socialist education."

    Mr. Li Zongren visited Guangdong and Guangxi from January 7th to March 19th, when he returned to Beijing. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is his hometown, and he calls Guangdong Province his second hometown. Seeing the tremendous changes in his hometown, he was very excited and praised that these two places "have achieved brilliant and splendid achievements" in socialist construction.

    Accompanying Mr. Li Zongren on his visit were his wife, Ms. Guo Dejie, and Mr. Cheng Siyuan. Ping Jiesan, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied them.

    Mr. Li Zongren and his entourage were warmly welcomed by the responsible persons of Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Tao Zhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and First Secretary of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, met and hosted a banquet to welcome them in Guangzhou. Lin Liming, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Acting Governor of Guangdong Province, and Wei Guoqing, First Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC and Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held welcome banquets for them successively.

    In Guangdong, Mr. Li Zongren and his party visited Guangzhou, the Pearl River Delta, Hainan Island, and Zhanjiang. Mr. Li Zongren said when discussing his observations from this visit: "This return to familiar places deeply impressed me with the completely new spiritual outlook of Guangdong Province. Socialist construction is thriving, and all aspects of industrial and agricultural production, as well as transportation and cultural construction, are progressing rapidly, far exceeding my imagination when I was overseas."

    Mr. Li Zongren said when discussing the achievements of agricultural production in Guangdong: "Guangdong is my second hometown. In the old society, Guangdong had no peace, and the people lived in misery. Since liberation, the Party Central Committee has led the people of the whole country in carrying out socialist construction. The Party and government leaders and workers and farmers of Guangdong Province, starting from the interests of the people, have relied on the endless power of the people to carry out large-scale construction, enabling the people of Guangdong, who relied on foreign rice for a living in the old society, to supply a lot of grain to the country today. Compared with the old society, there is a world of difference."

    In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Mr. Li Zongren and his party visited factories, schools, hospitals, people's communes, horticultural farms, water conservancy projects, etc., in Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and other places, and toured the scenic spots in Guilin. At the end of his trip to Guangxi, he talked about his impressions: "I was born and raised in Guangxi, and I know the past situation of Guangxi very well. Before returning home, many friends told me that Guangxi was doing well in construction, and I was skeptical at the time. After seeing it this time, it is indeed the case."

    He also said with emotion: "Zongren has returned to Guangxi this time with a feeling of atonement. On the one hand, I feel happy, and on the other hand, I also feel ashamed. I was responsible for the military and political affairs of Guangxi for a long time in the past, but I was hostile to the people, and I am really sorry for the people of Guangxi. Thinking of this, I feel deeply guilty."

    Mr. Li Zongren was particularly excited about the development of Guangxi. He said that Guangxi had no industry in the past, and Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and other places were all consumer cities. Now Guangxi's light and heavy industries have developed, and consumer cities have become productive cities. Mr. Li Zongren said: "Before liberation, Guangxi relied on neighboring provinces for food every year. Many farmers couldn't even eat cassava, which is now used to feed pigs. But now, due to the implementation of the national economic construction policy of 'taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor' and giving play to the superiority of the collective economy of the people's commune, the development of basic farmland construction, especially water conservancy construction, has achieved extremely significant results, and grain output has increased substantially. As a result, Guangxi, a historically grain-deficient province, is now self-sufficient and has a slight surplus. This is a great thing."

    Finally, Mr. Li Zongren talked to the reporter of this agency about his feelings about his trip to Guangdong and Guangxi. He said: "American imperialism is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership group in an attempt to isolate China and dominate the world. But now is not half a century ago, the Chinese people have stood up, and the oppressed nations have awakened. American imperialism has lost the support of the people and is trapped in the encirclement of the people of the world." He said: "Guangdong and Guangxi are located on the front lines of national defense. Our friendly neighboring country, Vietnam, is being invaded by American imperialism. American imperialism even attempts to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to China. During my visits to various places, I saw that everyone is fully prepared to oppose aggression. I did not see any fear of war on the faces of the people, and everyone was very calm. I believe that if American imperialism dares to impose war on us, it will definitely repeat the fate of Hitler and Tojo, and be buried in the ocean of people's war, and don't even think about getting out alive." He also said: "Zongren is willing to dedicate his remaining years to serving the patriotic anti-imperialist cause and the socialist construction of the motherland."

    During their visit to Guangdong and Guangxi, Mr. Li Zongren and others also met with the responsible persons of the CPPCC, local organizations of various democratic parties, and responsible persons of various people's organizations, as well as his relatives, old subordinates, etc.

    李宗仁先生谈参观访问观感
    广东广西社会主义建设获光辉成就
    新华社二十一日讯　李宗仁先生最近前往广东和广西两地进行两个多月的参观访问，他在谈到这两个地方的社会主义建设取得巨大成就时赞扬说：“只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，一向以人民的利益为利益，才能取得这样的成就。这次回乡，使我受到了一次社会主义的教育。”
    李宗仁先生从一月七日开始先后到广东和广西参观，三月十九日回到北京。广西壮族自治区是他的故乡，他称广东省是他的第二故乡。看到故乡面貌的巨大变化，他非常兴奋，称赞这两个地方在社会主义建设中“取得了光辉灿烂的成就”。
    同李宗仁先生一起参观访问的有他的夫人郭德洁女士以及程思远先生。中共中央统一战线工作部副部长平杰三陪同前往。
    李宗仁先生一行受到广东省和广西壮族自治区负责人的热烈欢迎。国务院副总理、中共中央中南局第一书记陶铸在广州会见并设宴欢迎他们。中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省代省长林李明，中共广西壮族自治区委员会第一书记、广西壮族自治区主席韦国清，先后为他们举行了欢迎宴会。
    在广东，李宗仁先生等一行先后访问了广州市、珠江三角洲、海南岛和湛江等地区。李宗仁先生在谈到这次访问的观感时说：“这次旧地重游，深感广东全省精神面貌焕然一新，社会主义建设蒸蒸日上，所有工农业生产以及交通文化各方面的建设事业，都在突飞猛进，远远超出了本人在海外时的想象。”
    李宗仁先生在谈到广东农业生产的成就时说：“广东是我的第二故乡。旧社会的广东，无日无天，民不聊生。自从解放之后，党中央领导全国人民进行社会主义建设，广东省党政领导和工农干部，以人民利益为出发点，依靠人民无穷无尽的威力进行大规模建设，使旧社会依赖洋米过活的广东人民，今日能够供应许多粮食给国家，这与旧社会相比，无异有霄壤之别。”
    在广西壮族自治区，李宗仁先生一行先后在南宁、柳州、桂林等地，参观访问了工厂、学校、医院、人民公社、园艺场、水利工程等，并游览了桂林风景名胜。他在结束广西之行的时候谈到自己的观感说：“我生在广西，长在广西，对广西过去的情况，深有所知。还乡前，很多朋友告诉我，广西建设得不错，我当时将信将疑。这次回来一看，果然如此。”
    他还感慨地说：“宗仁此番以赎罪的心情回到广西参观，一方面感到高兴，另一方面也感到惭愧。本人过去长期负过广西的军政责任，可是是与人民敌对的，实在对不起广西人民，言念及此，良深内疚。”
    李宗仁先生对广西的发展特别感到兴奋，他说：广西过去是没有什么工业的，南宁、柳州、桂林等地都是消费性的城市。现在广西的轻重工业都发展起来了，消费性城市变成了生产性的城市。李宗仁先生说：“解放前，广西年年是靠邻省救济吃饭的。不少农民甚至连现今喂猪的木薯都吃不上。可是现在，由于贯彻了‘以农业为基础，以工业为主导’的国民经济建设方针，发挥了人民公社集体经济的优越性，发展农田基本建设，特别是水利建设，成绩极其显著，粮食产量因此大幅度增长，从而使广西这个历史上缺粮的省份，自给并略有余。这是一件了不起的大事情。”
    李宗仁先生最后向本社记者谈到了他这次两广之行的感想，他说：“美帝国主义正在同苏联修正主义领导集团勾结，企图孤立中国，霸占全球。可是现在已经不是半个世纪以前了，中国人民站起来了，被压迫民族觉醒了。美帝国主义不得人心，已陷于全世界人民的包围之中。”他说：“广东和广西处于国防前线，我们邻国友邦越南正遭美帝国主义的侵略，美帝国主义甚至还妄图把侵越战争扩大到中国。我在各地的参观中，见到大家对此都是有着反对侵略的充分准备的。我没有见到人民有什么畏惧战争的神情，大家都很镇定。我相信，如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们的头上，它就一定重蹈希特勒、东条的下场，葬身于人民战争的海洋之中，休想活着出去。”他还说：“宗仁愿以有生之年，效劳于爱国反帝和祖国的社会主义建设事业。”
    李宗仁先生等在广东和广西访问期间，还会见了这两地的政协负责人、各民主党派地方组织和各人民团体的负责人，以及他的亲友、旧部属等。
