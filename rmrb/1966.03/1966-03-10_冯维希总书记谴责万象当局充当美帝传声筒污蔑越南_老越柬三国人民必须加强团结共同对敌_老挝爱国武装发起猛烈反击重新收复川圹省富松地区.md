    Hanoi, March 7 (Xinhua) -- According to a Vietnam News Agency report on March 7, Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Lao Patriotic Front, said in an interview with a Vietnam News Agency reporter that the Vientiane authorities were acting as spokesmen for U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for sending troops to Laos.

    Regarding the recent slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the Vientiane authorities, Phoumi Vongvichit told reporters: "The Vientiane authorities are essentially a puppet regime of U.S. imperialism controlled by the Lao right-wing reactionary clique." "Acting as spokesmen for U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to slander others means that their words are worthless and not worthy of any consideration."

    He said: "However, everyone should be vigilant against the slanderous campaign instigated by the Vientiane puppet regime under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. It has become a rule that whenever they recklessly carry out loud and slanderous campaigns, they are plotting another crime." In their lies and slanders, the Vientiane authorities deliberately emphasized the fantastical claim of "tens of thousands" of North Vietnamese troops "appearing and operating" in Central and Lower Laos. He said: "The purpose of spreading these false messages is to mislead public opinion and create an excuse for sending U.S. ground troops to Central and Lower Laos."

    He said, "The unprecedented slanderous propaganda launched by the Vientiane puppet authorities against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the behest of U.S. imperialists and their servants is part of the Johnson administration's new military adventure plan to intensify and expand the war of aggression in Indochina, a frenzied preparation to send U.S. ground troops to Central and Lower Laos."

    He recalled the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's statement on January 17, which called on the governments and peoples of relevant countries to take effective and timely measures to stop these dangerous and criminal war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

    He said, "The Lao people and patriotic forces have long seen through the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. They have prepared and further strengthened their solidarity with the fraternal people of other Indochinese countries and the people of other Asian countries. If the United States rashly infringes upon our territory, they are fully capable of dealing a fatal blow to the U.S. expeditionary forces. Lao traitors who sell their country to the United States and all their followers will receive the punishment they deserve at the hands of the people if they do not repent in time."

    In answering another question, Phoumi Vongvichit said, "The Lao people are determined to safeguard and develop their friendship with the fraternal Vietnamese people. The Lao people will never allow anyone to undermine the diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." He said, "At a time when U.S. imperialism is planning new military and political adventures that are extremely dangerous for the entire Indochina, it is even more necessary for the Lao, Vietnamese, and Cambodian peoples to further promote the spirit of the Indochinese People's Conference and strengthen their fighting solidarity against the common enemy."

    Kang Khai, March 8 (Xinhua) -- According to a "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast on March 8: The Lao patriotic armed forces recaptured the Phou Song area of Xieng Khouang Province on March 5, which had been illegally occupied by the Lao right-wing army and the Kong Le army.

    In February, when the Lao right-wing army and the Kong Le army launched a frantic offensive towards the Phou Kout mountain area of Xieng Khouang Province, they illegally occupied the Phou Song area controlled by the Lao patriotic forces. In order to defend the liberated areas and the Phou Kout mountain area, the Lao patriotic armed forces, in close cooperation with local militia guerrillas and local troops, launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy on the night of March 4 and 5. The enemy fled in disarray.

    冯维希总书记谴责万象当局充当美帝传声筒污蔑越南
    老越柬三国人民必须加强团结共同对敌
    老挝爱国武装发起猛烈反击重新收复川圹省富松地区
    据新华社河内七日电  据越南通讯社七日报道，老挝爱国战线党总书记富米·冯维希在接见越南通讯社记者时说，万象当局充当美帝国主义及其走狗的发言人，污蔑越南民主共和国派遣军队到老挝。
    富米·冯维希就万象当局最近对越南民主共和国的污蔑对记者说：“万象当局实质上是受老挝右派反动集团控制的美帝国主义的傀儡政权。”“充当美帝国主义及其走狗的发言人污蔑别人，因此他们的话毫无价值，不值得加以任何考虑。”
    他说：“但是，大家都应当对美帝国主义所唆使的万象傀儡政权的诽谤运动提高警惕。因为每当他们肆意进行大叫大嚷的诬蔑运动时，他们就在策划另一罪行，这已经成为一种规律。”万象当局在他们的谎言和污蔑中蓄意强调“数以万计”的越南北方军队在中寮和下寮“出现和活动”这种异想天开的说法。他说：“散布这些虚假的消息的目的，在于迷惑舆论，为往中寮和下寮派遣美国地面部队制造借口。”
    他说，“万象傀儡当局奉美帝国主义者及其仆从之命，对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国发动的前所未有诬蔑宣传，是根据约翰逊政府企图加紧和扩大侵略印度支那战争的新军事冒险计划，要把美国地面部队派到中寮和下寮去的疯狂准备活动的一部分。”
    他追述了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一月十七日的声明，这个声明呼吁有关各国政府和人民采取有效而及时的措施，制止美帝国主义的这些危险和罪恶的战争阴谋。
    他说，“老挝人民和爱国力量早就识破了美帝国主义的阴谋，他们已经作好准备并且进一步加强了他们同其他印度支那国家兄弟人民以及亚洲其他国家人民的团结。如果美国竟然轻率地侵犯我国领土的话，他们完全能够给予美国远征军以致命的打击。把祖国出卖给美国的老挝卖国贼和他们的一切追随者要是不及时悔改，将在人民手中受到应有的惩罚。”
    富米·冯维希在回答另一个问题时说：“老挝人民决心维护和发展他们同兄弟的越南人民的友谊。老挝人民决不容许任何人破坏老挝王国和越南民主共和国之间的外交关系。”他说：“在美帝国主义正在策划对整个印度支那说来极其危险的新的军事和政治冒险的时候，老挝、越南和柬埔寨人民更加有必要进一步发扬印度支那人民会议的精神，加强他们的战斗团结，反对共同敌人。”
    新华社康开八日电  据“老挝之声”电台八日广播：老挝各爱国武装力量三月五日重新收复被老挝右派军队和贡勒军队非法侵占的川圹省富松地区。
    二月间，老挝右派军队和贡勒军队在向川圹省富科特山地区发动疯狂进攻的时候，非法侵占了老挝爱国力量控制的富松地区。老挝爱国武装力量为了保卫解放区、保卫富科特山地区，在当地民兵游击队和地方部队的密切配合下，在三月四日夜间和五日向敌发起猛烈反击，敌人狼狈逃窜。
