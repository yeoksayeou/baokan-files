    Nationwide Promotion of New Technology for Tractor-Drawn Farm Implements
    —Hydraulic Suspended Implements
    This year, our country will extensively promote a new technology in the production of tractors and tractor-drawn farm implements – hydraulic suspended implements.
    When tractors are cultivating, they need to tow various drawn farm implements. Hydraulically suspending implements has more advantages than towing implements: it can reduce the weight of the implement by 30% to 50%, saving a large amount of steel; it has good maneuverability, suspended implements can be raised and lowered at any time, making movement convenient, operations more flexible, reducing headland space, and increasing efficiency by 15% to 20%; suspended implements are operated by the tractor driver, eliminating the need for a separate implement operator; the combination of the implement and the tractor is better, it can be automatically adjusted, and the quality of cultivation is also better.
    According to the plan of the Eighth Ministry of Machine Building, ten of the eleven models of tractors produced this year will be equipped with hydraulic suspension devices. In addition, more than seventy kinds of suspended implements will be produced accordingly, more than double the number last year.
    Although suspended implements have many advantages, they cannot completely replace drawn implements. Therefore, while increasing the production of hydraulic devices and suspended implements, various regions will continue to produce some drawn implements.

### 全国推广机引农具新技术——液压悬挂农具

    全国推广机引农具新技术
    ——液压悬挂农具
    今年我国将在拖拉机和机引农具的生产中大量推广一项新技术——液压悬挂农具。
    拖拉机在耕作的时候，后面都要拖带各种牵引农具。液压装置悬挂农具比牵引农具有更多的好处：可以减轻农具重量百分之三十到五十，能够节约大量钢材；机动性能好，悬挂农具可以随时升降，行走方便，作业比较灵活，少留地头，效率还提高百分之十五到二十；悬挂农具由拖拉机手操纵，不需另配农具手；农具和拖拉机的结合比较好，可以自动调节，耕作质量也比较好。
    根据第八机械工业部的计划，在今年生产的十一种型号的拖拉机中，将有十种配有液压悬挂装置。另外，将相应地生产七十多种悬挂农具，数量比去年增加一倍以上。
    悬挂农具虽然有许多优点，但是并不能完全代替牵引农具。因此，在增加生产液压装置和悬挂农具的同时，各地仍将继续生产一些牵引农具。
