    Production and Revolution

    Production is also revolution. To do a good job in production, you must have revolutionary drive.

    Previously, we thought that since the warp knitting machine was imported, it must be a good machine. When the trial production was not smooth, we blamed the poor quality of domestic capron. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's works and developing the spirit of daring to make revolution, we used indigenous methods and overcame the difficulty of uneven single yarn tension with a glass tube, and stabilized the temperature and humidity of the workshop with an earthen stove. The warp knitting machine has finally been put into production. This proves that it is not the poor quality of domestic capron, but our own poor revolutionary spirit.

    We are happy. What makes us happy is not how much nylon gray fabric we have woven, but that we have seen the role of Mao Zedong Thought in our workshop. It's still the same people, the same machines, and the same raw materials, but the face of production is completely different. It can be seen that without Mao Zedong Thought taking command, it is one way; with Mao Zedong Thought taking command, it is a completely different way.

    生产和革命
    生产也是革命。要搞好生产就要有革命的劲头。
    以前认为经编机是进口的，一定是好机器，试产不顺利，就怨国产卡普龙质量差。现在，学习了毛主席著作，发扬了敢于革命的精神，土法上马，一根玻璃管攻下了单条张力不匀的难关，一个土炉子稳定了车间的温度和湿度，经编机终于投产了。这证明不是国产卡普龙质量差，而是我们自己的革命精神差。
    我们高兴。高兴的不是织出了多少尼龙坯布，而是看到了毛主席思想在我们车间起的作用。还是我们这些人，还是这些机器，还是这些原料，生产面貌却完全不同了。可见，不用毛泽东思想挂帅，是一个样；用毛泽东思想挂帅，完全是另一个样。
