Title: Why Do the Masses Welcome the Simple Hemp Stripper?

    Guangdong Province plants approximately 200,000 mu of jute annually, requiring a large amount of labor for hemp stripping. In the past, farmers always stripped hemp by hand, which was inefficient, made their hands swollen and painful, and often cut their fingers on the hemp stalks. Farmers in hemp-growing areas urgently needed a hemp-stripping tool to replace manual hemp stripping.
    Not long ago, following the instructions of the leadership, I designed a simple hemp stripper, which has a simple structure and is easy to obtain materials. It has now been promoted and used in some hemp-growing areas in the province. I have successively received letters from the masses, all saying that this small tool solves the problem, and hoping that the production departments will supply more.
    Why do people welcome this tool so much? A very important reason is that it is cheap, only costing seven jiao per piece, affordable for everyone, economical and practical.
    In recent years, our Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute has designed many agricultural implements that are loved by farmers, but there are also some products that, due to the pursuit of large-scale and foreign designs in the design process, regardless of cost and divorced from reality, although successfully designed, cannot be promoted due to their high prices.
  In 1963, our institute organized the Zhujiang Type I rice combine harvester and six or seven other types of large and medium-sized agricultural implements to conduct field trials in areas such as Zhongshan County and Hainan Island. The commune members were not very interested in implements that required electricity or fuel, but were extremely interested in light and small manual rice harvesters, vying to ask how to operate these implements and how much they cost. At that time, we solicited their opinions on other large and medium-sized implements, and they said: "They are good, but our production team cannot afford them."
    We should consider that semi-mechanized implements use human or animal power as power, and the labor efficiency generally cannot be improved much more than manual operation. If the designed tools are very expensive, then the farmers would rather work harder and be less efficient than buy expensive tools. Here is an example: When we designed the manual rice harvester, the initial plan was that the cost per unit should not exceed six yuan. After the design, it only cost three yuan, and the use efficiency was also good. Everyone thought this was almost enough. But when we took it to solicit farmers' opinions, they still complained that the cost was high. This shows that although we have paid attention to reducing costs, there is still a considerable gap with the farmers' requirements.
    So, how can we achieve the goal of spending less money? We believe that resolutely implementing the principles of easy material procurement, easy manufacturing, and easy repair of products is an effective method. I designed the simple hemp stripper under such guiding ideology. The initial cost was four or five yuan, but after repeated improvements, it was finally reduced to seven jiao, while the use efficiency remained almost the same.

### 群众为什么欢迎简易剥麻器？

    群众为什么欢迎简易剥麻器？
    广东省每年种植黄麻约二十多万亩，需要很多劳动力剥麻。过去农民一向用手剥麻，效率低，手被磨得红肿疼痛，还常被麻杆割破指头。种麻地区的农民都迫切要求有一个剥麻工具代替手工剥麻。
    不久前，我按照领导的指示，设计了一个简易剥麻器，结构简单，取材方便，目前省内部分麻区已经推广和使用。我陆续接到一些群众来信，大家都说这个小工具解决问题，希望生产部门多供应一些。
    为什么人们这样欢迎这个工具呢？一个很重要的原因是它价格低，每个只要七角钱，人人都能买得起，经济而实惠。
    我们广东省农业机械研究所，近几年来设计出了不少为农民所喜爱用的农机具，但也有一部分产品，由于在设计过程中贪大求洋，不计成本，脱离实际，虽然设计成功了，由于价格太贵，无法推广。
  一九六三年，我们所组织了珠江一型水稻联合收割机等六七种大中型农机具，到中山县、海南岛等地区进行实地试验，社员们对需要用电力或燃料的机具都没有多大兴趣，而对轻小的人力割禾器却兴趣极大，争着问这些机具如何操作，售价多少。当时我们征求他们对其他大中型机具的意见，他们说：“好是好，可是我们生产队买不起。”
    我们应当考虑到，半机械化机具是用人力或畜力作动力，劳动效率一般说比手工操作不可能提高很多，要是设计出来的工具价钱很高，那么，农民宁愿辛苦一点，效率低一点，也不会去买价钱很高的工具。有这样一个例子，我们设计人力割禾器的时候，最初计划每部成本不能超过六元，设计出来以后只需要三元，使用效能也不错，大家都认为这样差不多了。但拿去征求农民的意见，他们还是嫌成本高。这说明了，我们虽然已经注意到降低成本了，但与农民的要求还有相当大的距离。
    那么，怎样才能达到少花钱的目的呢？我们认为，坚决贯彻产品的取材容易、制造容易、修理容易是一个有效办法。我设计简易剥麻器，就是在这样的指导思想下进行的，最初成本要四五元，经过一再改进，最后降低到七角钱，而使用效率仍然差不多。
