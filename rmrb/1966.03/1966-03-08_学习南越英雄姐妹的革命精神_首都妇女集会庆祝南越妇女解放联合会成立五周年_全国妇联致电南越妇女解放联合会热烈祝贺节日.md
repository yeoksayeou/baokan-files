    (Xinhua News Agency, 7th) More than a thousand women from all walks of life in the capital held a rally this afternoon to warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation, extending the warmest congratulations and highest respect to the heroic South Vietnamese sisters fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.
    Liu Qingyang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation; Sun Xiaocun, Vice President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association; Luo Qiong, Cao Mengjun, and Yang Yunyu, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation; and Shen Zijiu, member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, attended the meeting.
    The meeting was held in the auditorium of the National Culture Palace and was presided over by Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Beijing Women's Federation.
    Huang Wanli, a member of the Permanent Mission of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, was invited to attend the meeting and gave a long report on the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese women bravely resisting the American aggressors.
    Liu Qingyang spoke first at the meeting. She warmly praised the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation for its great contributions to the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, uniting the broad masses of women in South Vietnam. She said that Chinese women are proud to have South Vietnamese sisters as comrades-in-arms. We must take them as our example and learn from their heroic spirit and revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win.
    Huang Wanli was invited to speak amidst warm applause. He said that the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation, with more than two million members, has made great contributions to the cause of national liberation and the anti-American national salvation struggle. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front has given the South Vietnamese women an extremely high evaluation.
    He said that the achievements of the South Vietnamese women are inseparable from the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people and the heroic liberation army, as well as the support of the North Vietnamese people; and they are inseparable from the sincere assistance of women all over the world, especially Chinese women. He said that the South Vietnamese people and women realize that the Chinese people and women are our sincere comrades-in-arms who share life and death.
    Huang Wanli severely condemned the towering crimes of American imperialism in cruelly murdering innocent women and children in South Vietnam. He said that American imperialism used even more barbaric methods than the fascist bandit Hitler to harm South Vietnamese women. Now, 150,000 women in South Vietnam have joined the ranks of guerrillas, militia, and self-defense forces. They bravely and resourcefully appear on the fiery battlefields, in the ranks of demonstrations, and in the deep mountains and forests to strike at the American aggressors from all aspects.
    Huang Wanli shouted at the end of his speech: Vietnam will win, the American imperialists will be defeated!
    (Xinhua News Agency, 7th) The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China praised the South Vietnamese women today in a telegram sent to the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation, saying they have established indelible merits for the revolutionary cause of the South Vietnamese people. In the telegram, the All-China Women's Federation reiterated: Chinese women and the people of the whole country will, as always, no matter what happens, stand firmly with the South Vietnamese brothers and sisters, shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand, to fight to the end for the complete defeat of American imperialism.
    The All-China Women's Federation sent the telegram to the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the organization. In the congratulatory telegram, the All-China Women's Federation also extended the warmest festive greetings and militant salute to the South Vietnamese sisters fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.
    In its congratulatory telegram, the All-China Women's Federation praised the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation for closely uniting the broad masses of women and actively participating in the anti-American national salvation struggle on the front and rear under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front for the past five years. The telegram pointed out that the heroic spirit of South Vietnamese women, who are not afraid of violence, not afraid of sacrifice, dare to struggle, and dare to win, has set a brilliant example for women all over the world who are oppressed and seeking liberation, and is a great encouragement to them.
    In its telegram, the All-China Women's Federation wished the South Vietnamese people and women continuous new and more brilliant victories in the great struggle to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the motherland.

    全国妇联副主席刘清扬，中国越南友好协会副会长孙晓村，全国妇联书记处书记罗琼、曹孟君、杨蕴玉，全国妇联主席团委员沈兹九等出席了大会。
    大会在民族文化宫礼堂举行，北京市妇联主任张晓梅主持大会。

    刘清扬首先在会上讲话。她热情地赞扬越南南方妇女解放联合会在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，团结越南南方广大妇女群众，对越南人民的抗美救国斗争，作出的巨大贡献。她说，中国妇女为有越南南方姐妹这样的战友而感到自豪。我们要以她们为榜样，学习她们敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概和革命精神。
    黄万里在热烈的掌声中应邀讲话。他说，拥有二百多万会员的越南南方妇女解放联合会，在祖国解放事业和抗美救国斗争中作出了巨大的贡献。越南南方民族解放阵线给予越南南方妇女极高的评价。
    他说，越南南方妇女取得的成就，是同越南南方人民和英雄的解放军的英勇战斗，以及越南北方人民的支援分不开的；是和全世界妇女、尤其是中国妇女的真诚援助分不开的。他说，越南南方人民和妇女认识到，中国人民和妇女是我们生死与共的真诚的战友。
    黄万里严厉谴责美帝国主义在越南南方残酷杀害无辜妇女和儿童的滔天罪行。他说，美帝国主义使用了比法西斯强盗希特勒还要野蛮的手段残害越南南方妇女。现在越南南方已经有十五万妇女参加了游击队、民兵、自卫队的行列，她们勇敢机智地出没在战火纷飞的战场，出现在游行示威的队伍里，出现在深山丛林中从各个方面来打击美国侵略者。
    黄万里在结束讲话时高呼：越南必胜，美帝必败。

    全国妇联是为越南南方妇女解放联合会成立五周年而致电越南南方这个妇女解放组织的。全国妇联在贺电中还向战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南南方姐妹致最热烈的节日祝贺和战斗的敬礼。
    全国妇联在贺电中赞扬越南南方妇女解放联合会五年来在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下紧密团结广大妇女群众，在前线和后方积极参加抗美救国斗争。电报指出，越南南方妇女不畏强暴、不怕牺牲、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概，为全世界被压迫、求解放的妇女树立了光辉的榜样，是对她们的极大的鼓舞。
    全国妇联在电报中祝越南南方人民和妇女在解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大斗争中，不断获得新的、更加辉煌的胜利。
