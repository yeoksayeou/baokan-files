    Politics is the Commander - A Selection of Articles from Factory and Mine Newspapers
    Helping Out
    Beijing Railway Bureau　Shang Zhongxin
    I’ve been working as an assistant to Master Yang in the paint crew for several months now.
    But lately, I’ve felt a bit awkward helping Master Yang. It’s not that I look down on Master Yang. I know that I can’t compare to him in terms of seniority or class consciousness; and in terms of skill, Master Yang is the authority in our group, and I wholeheartedly admire him.
    But then again, Master Yang always asks me to carry paint cans and help out. Doesn’t this make me like one of those flag wavers on the opera stage? The Party repeatedly calls for cultivating successors. If I don't get to do the work, how can I be a successor? I often think to myself: It’s about time he let me work independently, but Master Yang never mentions it, which really makes me anxious.
    Recently, whenever Master Yang asks me to do something, I often do it slowly, and my replies aren't as loud and crisp as they were when I first arrived. But I've also noticed that Master Yang seems to know what's on my mind, which makes me uneasy, but then I think, it's good that he knows, so let him deal with it.
    My work has become worse and worse than before.
    One day at noon, just after finishing lunch, Master Yang gave me a booklet of "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and said, "Come on, my education isn’t as good as yours, you read it to me, and we'll study together." I obediently opened the booklet and started reading. When I read the sentence "This is also an excellent lesson for those who are fickle... and think there is no way out," he suddenly stopped me and said, "Wait, what does 'fickle' mean?" "It means not wanting to do this and not wanting to do that," I replied. "Explain it more specifically, and maybe give a real-life example." I said:
      "We should be content with whatever we do and not be picky." "What do you think?" he asked me directly. I felt my head buzz and swell. I think my face must have been very ugly at that time.
      “This…” I couldn’t answer.
      “This what?” Seeing me hesitate, he spoke again. But the tone and pitch of his voice changed from the seriousness just now to very gentle. He said, "Don't be angry with me. We must use what Chairman Mao said to compare our work and life, and correct anything that is not done well, so that we can be good servants of the people. ... Although we are upper and lower hands in production, this is a different division of labor in the revolution, and all work is to serve the people.” I suddenly grabbed Master Yang's hand and said shamefully, "Master Yang, I..." Before I could finish speaking, he interrupted me and said, "It's nothing, young man, from now on we will do what Chairman Mao taught us.”
    My heart was filled with excitement, and I blurted out, "Master Yang, you are so good!"

    政治是统帅——厂矿报刊文选
    下手活儿
    北京铁路局　尚忠信
    我到油漆组跟杨师傅干活，已经有好几个月了。
    可是近些日子来，我总觉得给杨师傅打下手挺别扭。这并不是我看不起杨师傅，我知道论工龄，论阶级觉悟我都不能和他比；论技术，杨师傅是我们小组的权威，我当然也是心悦诚服的。
    但话又说回来了，杨师傅总叫我给他提油罐、打下手，我这不成了戏台上的打旗儿的了吗？党一再号召培养接班人，不叫我干活我怎么接班呢？我常暗暗想：不大离儿的也该叫我单独干干啦，可杨师傅总不吐这个口，真叫我着急。
    近一个时期来，杨师傅叫我干什么活，我常常慢慢腾腾的，答应的也不象刚来时那么响亮干脆了。但我也发现杨师傅好象知道了我的心事，这使我很不安，但又一转念，他知道了也好，那你就看着办吧。
    我的活越干越不如以前了。
    一天中午，刚吃完午饭，杨师傅一面给了我一本《纪念白求恩》的小册子，一面说：“来，我不如你文化高，你念给我听听，咱们一块学学。”我顺从地打开小册子念起来。当我读到“这对于一班见异思迁的人，……以为无出路的人，也是一个极好的教训”这句话时，他忽然止住说：“等等，这见异思迁是什么意思呀？”“就是不愿干这个又不愿干那个的意思呗。”我回答说。“你把它说具体点，也可举个实际事。”我说：
  “我们干什么就应当安心，不要挑这挑那的。”“那你是怎样想的呀？”他单刀直入地问我了。我觉得脑袋嗡的一下大得不行。我想我那时的脸色一定是很难堪的。
      “这……”我回答不出话来。
  “这什么？”他见我吞吞吐吐地说不出话来，又开口了。不过他说话的语气音调，却一变刚才的严肃而为非常温和了。说：“你不要生我的气，我们要用毛主席讲的话来对照我们的工作和生活，看看那作的不好就改过来，这样才能当好人民的勤务员。……咱俩在生产上虽是上下手，但这是革命分工的不同，一切工作都是为人民服务的。”我猛一下握住杨师傅的手，惭愧地说：“杨师傅，我……”还没等我说下去，他就打断我的话说：“没什么，小伙子，今后咱就照着毛主席他老人家的话去做就行了。”
    我心中一阵激动，口中不自觉地脱口而出：“杨师傅，你真好！”
