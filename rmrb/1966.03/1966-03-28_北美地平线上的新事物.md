    New Things on the North American Horizon
    Xiang Donghui
    On the world political stage, new things and new phenomena with revolutionary significance frequently appear. These new things are initially in a nascent state and often go unnoticed, but they will eventually grow and blossom with dazzling brilliance. These new phenomena often begin as subtle changes, yet they are signals of greater transformations.

    American imperialism is the center of world reactionary forces and the largest bastion of the imperialist system. Today, on the American horizon, many noteworthy new phenomena are also emerging. They indicate that profound changes are taking place within the United States.

    One phenomenon is the new awakening of the American black masses.

    In recent years, the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for equal rights and freedom has greatly developed. In particular, large-scale mass movements occurred in 1960, 1963, and 1964. However, these struggles mainly took the form of sit-ins, strikes, peaceful marches, and so on.

    By August of last year, a new phenomenon appeared in the American black struggle: resisting violence with violence. Black people in the Watts district of Los Angeles took up guns and homemade Molotov cocktails to fight the military police, occupying Watts for two days. Subsequently, violent struggles by blacks also occurred in Chicago and other places. Even in the South, where racism is rampant and non-violence is prevalent, black armed self-defense organizations have sprung up.

    Four years ago, when black aristocrats and clergymen like Martin Luther King Jr. were advocating the "philosophy of non-violent struggle," many black people cheered "Amen!" and "Yes!" for him. Last year, the situation was very different. His speeches received only the sparse support of a few clergymen standing behind him. The "philosophy of non-violent struggle" is no longer effective. This is a rare event in the history of the American black movement in nearly a hundred years.

    Another phenomenon is the new development of the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    American imperialism has waged many foreign wars in history. These wars have met with varying degrees of opposition at home. For example, when American imperialism launched wars to re-divide the world at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, seizing the Philippines from Spain, the American writer Mark Twain angrily criticized it. He wrote: "We are driving our pure youth to take up shameful weapons, carrying flags that even former bandits dared not use, to rob. We have sullied the name of America, and now the whole world looks at us with contempt."

    During the American war of aggression against Korea, there was a "Don't Interfere in Korea" movement in the United States. New York held a demonstration of five thousand people, and Chicago held a peace conference demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea.

    Since American imperialism expanded its war of aggression against Vietnam last year, the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam has shown many new features. The scale of this movement is unprecedented and has broad popular support. Many American youths burned their draft cards, preferring to go to jail rather than go to the battlefield. Some four Americans even self-immolated, demonstrating the sharp contradictions between the people and the ruling class. Although the American government directed some liberals and moderates to control this movement, the broad masses of the people put forward slogans such as "Oppose imperialist war," "The imperialist system is the basis of the Vietnam War," "Destroy this system," and "Establish a new America," directly targeting the American government and the imperialist system. This is a first in American history.

    The American black movement has broken through the shackles of "non-violentism" and has begun to embark on the path of violent struggle. The American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam has broken through the control of pacifists and has begun to direct the spearhead of struggle against domestic imperialism. These are all new things and new phenomena with revolutionary significance rising on the American horizon.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Metabolism is a universal and eternally irresistible law in the universe."

    Everything is divided into two, and its interior contains both new and old aspects. The new develops upwards, the old develops downwards, and the new will eventually defeat the old.

    The development of American society cannot escape this law of metabolism either. The United States is also divided into two. On the North American continent, there have always been two Americas: one is the America of the Rockefellers, Morgans, and reactionaries such as Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, which is a corrupt force; the other is the America of the American people, which is a nascent force. What represents the direction of American social development is not the force that seems solid now but is decaying, but the force that seems weak now but is developing.

    Any new thing is initially small and weak. However, it is the most vital and promising. After a series of tortuous struggles, the new thing grows from small to large, from weak to strong, and eventually achieves a dominant position. The new awakening of the American people and the new development of the American people's struggle reflect that the new America is moving forward. Although American blacks only occupied Watts for two days with simple weapons; and in the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam, only some slogans targeting the imperialist system have just appeared, this is a change of great significance, the prelude to a larger people's movement.

    Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries must be sensitive to new things, be good at discovering the buds of new things appearing on the horizon, and be good at observing the direction of the wind. In this way, they can be far-sighted, see the trivial and know the significant, and foresee the prominent and great changes of tomorrow from today's insignificant and gradual changes.

    The American situation must change. People all over the world must overthrow American imperialism. The American people will surely rise up in revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once said this about the future of the American people: The situation in the United States, "where the enemy is strong and we are weak, is completely a temporary phenomenon, and it will definitely change in the opposite direction." This scientific prediction of Comrade Mao Zedong will surely become a glorious reality.

### 北美地平线上的新事物

    北美地平线上的新事物
    向东辉
    世界政治舞台上，经常出现富有革命意义的新事物和新现象。这些新事物，起初是处于萌芽状态，往往不引起人们注意，但它终究要成长起来，放出光彩夺目的花朵。这些新现象，起初往往是一种不太显著的变化，然而它却是大变化的信号。
    美帝国主义是世界反动势力的中心，是帝国主义制度的最大堡垒。今天，在美国的地平线上，也出现许多值得注意的新现象。它表明，在美国国内也正在发生深刻的变化。
    现象之一，是美国黑人群众的新觉醒。
    最近几年以来，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取平等和自由权利的斗争，有了很大的发展。特别是在一九六○年、一九六三年、一九六四年曾经发生过大规模的群众运动。但是，这些斗争主要地还是采取静坐示威、罢工罢课、和平进军等等方式。
    到了去年八月，美国黑人斗争出现了一种新现象，那就是以暴力来反抗暴力。洛杉矶市瓦茨区的黑人拿起了枪支和自制燃烧瓶同军警进行了战斗，占领瓦茨区达两天之久。接着，在芝加哥等地也发生黑人的暴力斗争。甚至在种族主义猖獗、非暴力主义盛行的南部，也纷纷出现黑人的武装自卫组织。
    四年前，黑人贵族、牧师马丁·路德·金之流在鼓吹“非暴力斗争哲学”的时候，许多黑人群众对他高呼“亚门！”“对呀！”去年，情况却大不相同。他的演说只得到稀稀落落的站在他背后的几个牧师的支持。“非暴力斗争哲学”已经有些吃不开了。这是近百年来美国黑人运动历史上罕见的事情。
    现象之二，是美国人民反对侵越战争运动的新发展。
    美帝国主义在历史上曾经进行过许多次对外战争。这些战争在国内曾经遇到过不同程度的反对。例如，当十九世纪末、二十世纪初美帝国主义发动重新分割世界的战争，从西班牙手中夺取菲律宾的时候，美国作家马克·吐温就给予愤怒的抨击。他写道：“我们驱使我国纯洁的青年拿起可耻的武器，打着昔日盗匪所不敢用的旗帜去进行抢劫。我们污辱了美国的名誉，现在全世界都以轻蔑的眼光注视着我们。”
    在美国侵朝战争时期，美国国内有过“不许干涉朝鲜”运动。纽约举行过五千人的示威游行，芝加哥举行过和平大会，要求美军撤出朝鲜。
    从去年美帝国主义扩大侵越战争以后，美国人民的反对侵越战争运动出现了许多新的气象。这个运动的规模是空前的，并且具有广泛的群众性。许多美国青年烧毁征兵证，宁肯坐牢，也拒不上战场，甚至有四个美国人自焚，表现了人民同统治集团之间的尖锐矛盾。尽管美国政府指使一些自由主义分子和温和派去控制这个运动，但是广大人民群众却提出了“反对帝国主义战争”，“帝国主义制度是越南战争的基础”，要“摧毁这个制度”，“建立一个新美国”等口号，把矛头直接指向美国政府和帝国主义制度。这在美国历史上是第一次。
    美国的黑人运动冲开了“非暴力主义”的藩篱，开始走上暴力斗争的道路。美国人民反对侵越战争的运动，突破了和平主义者的控制，开始把斗争的锋芒针对本国帝国主义。这都是在美国地平线上升起的富有革命意义的新事物和新现象。
    毛泽东同志说：“新陈代谢是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抵抗的规律。”
    任何事物都是一分为二，它的内部都包含着新的和旧的两个方面。新的向上发展，旧的向下发展，新的终究要战胜旧的。
    美国社会的发展，也逃不脱这个新陈代谢的规律。美国也是一分为二的。在北美大陆上，从来就存在着两个美国：一个是洛克菲勒、摩根和杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪、约翰逊等反动派的美国，这是腐朽的势力；一个是美国人民的美国，这是新生的势力。代表美国社会发展方向的，不是现时似乎坚固然而正在衰亡着的势力，而是现时似乎弱小然而正在发展着的势力。
    任何新生事物，起初都是细小的，微弱的。但是，它是最有生命力的，最有前途的。经过一系列的曲折斗争，新生事物由小变大，从弱变强，最终取得支配地位。美国人民的新觉醒和美国人民斗争的新发展，反映着新生的美国在前进。虽然美国黑人拿起简陋的武器占领瓦茨区不过两天；在美国人民的反对侵越战争的运动中，也只是刚刚出现一些针对帝国主义制度的口号。然而，这却是具有重要意义的变化，是更大的人民运动的序幕。
    马克思列宁主义者和革命者要具有对新鲜事物的敏感，要善于去发现地平线上出现的新事物的苗头，要善于观察风向。这样就能够高瞻远瞩，见微知著，从今天的不显著的逐渐变化预见到明天的突出的大变化。
    美国的局面一定要变。全世界人民要打倒美帝国主义。美国人民也一定会起来革命。
    毛泽东同志对于美国人民的前途，曾经这样说过：美国“那里目前敌强我弱这种形势，完全是暂时的现象，它一定会向相反的方向起变化。”毛泽东同志的这个科学的预言，必将变为光辉的现实。
