　　Since the Second World War, U.S. imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism in colonizing South Korea, turning it step by step into an American military base and a new type of colony in the Far East. South Korea's politics, economy, military, and culture are all under the control of U.S. imperialism.

　　U.S. imperialism exercises strict military control over South Korea. Currently, there are as many as 55,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. They directly control over 700,000 South Korean puppet troops. In the organs above the puppet army regiment (battalion) level, there are American "advisors," and all military actions must be "approved" by them in advance. The U.S. military command stationed in South Korea directly implements the U.S. military colonial policy in South Korea and is also the highest military organ in South Korea.

　　Moreover, the United States has turned South Korea into an important base for further expanding its war of aggression in Asia. At present, the United States has established more than 30 army, navy, air force, missile bases, and military facilities in South Korea. Since the Korean armistice, the United States has repeatedly violated the armistice agreement, illegally transporting "Honest John" rockets, as well as various weapons such as "Matador," "Nike-Hercules," and "Hawk" missiles, into South Korea.

　　Last March, the United States handed over "Hawk" missiles to the South Korean puppet army and helped it establish a so-called "Hawk Missile Air Defense Force," which was trained by the U.S. Fourth Missile Command stationed in South Korea to launch missiles. To "legalize" this action, on June 7, the United States and the Park Chung-hee group signed an "agreement" on transporting surface-to-air "Nike" missiles into South Korea and handing them over to the South Korean puppet army. On June 26, the U.S. nuclear submarine "Sergeant Fish" entered Jinhae Port in South Korea, and at the same time, it began negotiations with the South Korean puppet authorities to establish a base in South Korea for American nuclear submarines equipped with "Polaris" missiles for use in the Far East.

　　In the economic field, the United States, through its "Economic Cooperation Office" stationed in South Korea, comprehensively controls the economic lifeline of South Korea, directs and supervises the Park Chung-hee puppet regime to implement the economic enslavement policy of U.S. imperialism, and turns South Korea into a market for American goods and a source of raw materials. American "surplus" grain is dumped in large quantities in South Korea, reaching 30 million tons from 1945 to 1959 alone.

　　After Park Chung-hee came to power, he signed the "South Korea-U.S. Surplus Agricultural Products Agreement" with the United States, and the number of dumped grain increased even more sharply. According to statistics, the United States provided about 4 billion U.S. dollars in economic "aid" to South Korea from 1945 to 1964, while during this period, the excess profits seized by the United States from South Korea amounted to more than 10 billion U.S. dollars. As for the economic losses caused to South Korea by the U.S. economic plunder, the amount is even more staggering.

### 美帝国主义对南朝鲜的控制和掠夺

    美帝国主义对南朝鲜的控制和掠夺
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义者代替了日本帝国主义者的地位，对南朝鲜实行殖民统治，使南朝鲜一步步变成美国在远东的一个军事基地和新型殖民地。南朝鲜的政治、经济、军事、文化，全部都受到美帝国主义的控制。
    美帝国主义对南朝鲜实行严格的军事控制。目前，美国驻在南朝鲜的侵略军已达五万五千名之多。他们直接管辖七十多万南朝鲜伪军，在伪军联队（团）以上的机关中，都有美国“顾问”，一切军事行动都要事先经过他们的“批示”。驻南朝鲜美军司令部直接执行美国在南朝鲜的军事殖民政策，也是南朝鲜的最高军事机关。
    不仅如此，美国已把南朝鲜变为其在亚洲进一步扩大侵略战争的重要基地。目前，美国在南朝鲜建立的陆军、海军、空军、导弹基地和军事设施已经有三十多处。从朝鲜停战以来，美国就不止一次地违反停战协定，非法向南朝鲜运进“诚实的约翰”火箭，以及“斗牛士”、“奈克—赫尔克里士”和“隼式”导弹等各种武器。
    去年三月，美国把“隼式”导弹交给南朝鲜伪军，并帮助它建立了所谓“隼式导弹防空部队”，由驻在南朝鲜的美国第四导弹司令部负责训练伪军发射导弹。为了使这一行动“合法”化，六月七日，美国同朴正熙集团签署了关于把地对空“奈克”导弹运入南朝鲜并交给南朝鲜伪军的“协定”。六月二十六日，美国把核潜艇“军曹鱼”号开进南朝鲜镇海港，同时开始与南朝鲜傀儡当局谈判，要在南朝鲜建立一个远东地区供装备着“北极星”导弹的美国核潜艇使用的基地。
    在经济方面，美国通过其驻南朝鲜的“经济协办处”，全面控制着南朝鲜的经济命脉，指挥和监督朴正熙傀儡政权执行美帝国主义的经济奴役政策，把南朝鲜变成美国商品销售市场和原料供应地。美国的“剩余”粮食向南朝鲜大量倾销，仅从一九四五年至一九五九年就达三千万吨。
    朴正熙上台以后，与美国签订了“韩美剩余农产品协定”，倾销粮食的数量更为激增。据统计，美国从一九四五年至一九六四年向南朝鲜提供了约四十亿美元的经济“援助”，而在这期间，美国从南朝鲜所攫取的超额利润达一百多亿美元。至于南朝鲜因美国的经济掠夺而造成的经济损失，数量就更大得惊人了。
