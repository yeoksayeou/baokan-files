    Since the beginning of this year, with the bankruptcy of the Johnson administration's "peace offensive" and the further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the American people's movement against the war has deepened. In 1965, the American people's movement against the war underwent significant changes, gradually developing from an isolated movement into a nationwide one. Since the beginning of this year, the movement has seen many new forms, with an increasingly wide range of participating classes; the spearhead of the struggle is increasingly directed at the American ruling clique and its leading figures; the movement is gradually expanding to the southern states, increasingly closely integrated with the black people's struggle; more and more Americans are beginning to realize that the American imperialism that oppresses and exploits the people of the world is precisely the same imperialism that oppresses and exploits them in their own country.

    Surging Struggles

    On New Year's Day evening this year, a light aircraft dropped a large number of leaflets over the Long Beach Naval Base near Los Angeles and a park in the suburbs of Los Angeles, protesting against the US war of aggression against Vietnam. This was the first time the American people used an aircraft to distribute anti-war leaflets. On the evening of January 14, another light aircraft dropped a large number of leaflets over Oakland, California, condemning US atrocities in Vietnam. This new form of protest shocked the American ruling clique.

    An increasing number of American artists are participating in the anti-war movement, which is also unprecedented. In February, a group of artists in Los Angeles constructed a 60-foot-high "Tower of Protest" out of purple and yellow steel bars in Hollywood's "Sunset Plaza" to protest the US government's Vietnam policy. More than 200 anti-war paintings and some sculptures were hung on the tower. At the opening ceremony, attended by more than 1,000 people, some speakers delivered speeches condemning the war of aggression against Vietnam, which were met with cheers from the audience.

    Many American scientists have also joined the anti-war movement. In mid-January this year, twenty-nine American biologists, chemists, and physicists issued a statement condemning the US military's use of chemical poisons in South Vietnam to destroy crops and release poisonous gas. The statement said, "Taking this approach demonstrates a shocking decline in our moral standards," and demanded that Johnson immediately stop this "shocking and immoral" act.

    Since the beginning of this year, more and more American women have participated in the movement. On February 9, more than 1,000 women from all over the United States held a demonstration in front of the White House to protest the US government's expansion of the war in Vietnam.

    The Johnson administration's continuous expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam has aroused opposition and unease among broad sections of American society. On February 18, the American "Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America," with 380,000 members, issued a statement expressing its "strongest opposition" to the further "escalation of (the Vietnamese) military operations" by the United States. Although this union is controlled by the AFL-CIO, the largest reactionary union in the United States, it publicly issued a statement opposing the government's Vietnam policy. On March 8, 1,200 workers gathered in New York to protest the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    Some American veterans and reservists have also formed the "Veterans and Reservists to End the War in Vietnam." This organization launched a demonstration in front of the White House on February 5. The veterans and reservists among the demonstrators demanded that their service ribbons, medals, and discharge certificates be returned to US President Johnson.

    The Spearhead Points at Johnson

    Since the beginning of this year, the goals of the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam have become increasingly clear, and the spearhead of the struggle is increasingly directly aimed at the American government and its leading figure, Johnson, who resolutely implements the policy of aggression against Vietnam.

    On February 5, Johnson personally went to Honolulu to discuss further expansion plans for the war of aggression against Vietnam with US military and political officials and South Vietnamese puppets. As soon as he got off the plane, he was surrounded by local demonstrators, who shouted slogans against the war of aggression against Vietnam and waved signs such as "Murderer, go home!" and "Stop Johnson's War." On February 23, when Johnson was advocating his Vietnam policy at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, more than 7,000 members of the New York public, ignoring police obstruction and sabotage by reactionary elements, held a grand demonstration outside the hotel, demanding that US troops withdraw from South Vietnam.

    US Vice President Humphrey and Secretary of State Rusk, who ran around to defend Johnson's Vietnam policy, were also condemned by demonstrators. On January 2, 150 Honolulu residents held a demonstration when Humphrey passed through Honolulu on his way home from a visit to the Far East, protesting the Vietnam policy. On January 31, in Chicago, some people protested against Humphrey, who was there to defend Johnson's resumption of bombing. On March 14, when Rusk delivered a speech at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston defending Johnson's Vietnam policy, more than 100 people held a protest demonstration in front of the hotel.

    Black People Actively Join the Movement

    Since the beginning of this year, the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam has deepened into the southern states with concentrated black populations, which is a new trend. According to a report in the January 1 issue of the *National Guardian* weekly, a group of black movement leaders and university faculty and students from southern states met in Atlanta, Georgia, last November to form the "Southern Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam." An official from this committee said that anti-war organizations have now been established in seven southern cities, including Miami, New Orleans, Austin, and St. Louis, and that preparations are actively underway for their establishment in other southern cities. The official also said, "There is a clear sentiment among many black people in the South that they will not fight for white people."

    The American black movement organization "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee" issued a public statement on January 6 strongly condemning the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy and calling on black youth to refuse military service.

    On February 12, the "Southern Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam" organized anti-war demonstrations in more than a dozen southern cities. This demonstration was supported by people in some large northern and western cities. People in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Chicago held demonstrations in support.

    With the development of the anti-war movement, more and more black people oppose the American ruling clique's enlistment of black people as cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Vietnam. A reporter from the *Challenge* weekly, the organ of the American Progressive Labor Party, recently conducted a field interview in Harlem, New York City's black "ghetto," to investigate the attitudes of ordinary black people toward the American war of aggression against Vietnam. Those interviewed included black workers, the unemployed, students, writers, and ordinary residents. In their conversations, they almost unanimously opposed black people sacrificing their lives for the American ruling clique's war of aggression against Vietnam. A black writer said, "Black people fighting in South Vietnam is fighting against themselves." (Fan)

### 美国人民反对侵越战争运动深入发展

    美国人民反对侵越战争运动深入发展
    今年以来，随着约翰逊政府“和平攻势”骗局的破产和进一步扩大侵越战争，美国人民反对侵越战争运动有了深入的发展。一九六五年一年中，美国人民反对侵越战争运动发生了很大的变化，它由孤立的运动，逐渐发展成为全国性的运动。今年以来，这个运动更出现了许多新的形式，参加的阶层愈来愈广泛；斗争的矛头愈来愈直接指向美国统治集团及其首脑人物；运动逐渐向南方各州展开，与黑人斗争日益密切地结合起来；越来越多的美国人民开始认识到，压迫、剥削全世界人民的美帝国主义，也正是压迫、剥削他们自己的本国帝国主义。
    风起云涌的斗争
    今年元旦晚上，一架轻型飞机在洛杉矶附近的长滩海军基地和洛杉矶近郊公园的上空投下了大批传单，抗议美国进行侵略越南战争。这是美国人民第一次利用飞机散发反战传单。一月十四日晚上，在加利福尼亚州奥克兰市上空，又有一架轻型飞机投下了大量传单，谴责美国在越南的暴行。这种新的抗议形式，使美国统治集团十分震惊。
    美国的艺术家越来越多地参加反对侵越战争运动，这也是前所未见的。二月，洛杉矶的一批艺术家在好莱坞的“夕阳广场”用紫色和黄色的钢条筑成一座高达六十英尺的“抗议之塔”，抗议美国政府的侵越政策。塔上悬挂着两百多幅反对侵越战争的图画和一些雕刻品。在一千多人参加的落成典礼上，一些演说者发表谴责侵越战争的言论博得全场欢呼。
    不少的美国科学家也参加了反对侵越战争运动。今年一月中，二十九位美国生物学家、化学家和物理学家，发表声明谴责美军在南越使用化学毒药毁灭农作物和施放毒气。声明说，“采取这种做法表明我们道德标准的惊人堕落”，要求约翰逊立即停止这种“令人震惊的、不道德的”行径。
    今年以来，参加运动的美国妇女愈来愈多了。二月九日，来自美国各地的妇女一千多名在白宫前面举行了示威，抗议美国政府在越南扩大战争。
    约翰逊政府不断扩大侵越战争行动，引起美国广泛阶层的反对和不安。二月十八日，拥有三十八万名成员的美国“混合成衣工人工会”发表了一项声明，对美国“（侵越）军事行动的进一步升级”表示“最强烈的反对”。虽然这个工会是美国最大的反动工会劳联—产联控制下的，但是它公开发表声明反对政府侵越政策。三月八日，一千二百名工人在纽约集会，抗议侵越战争。
    美国一些退伍军人和后备役军人也成立了“退伍军人和后备役军人结束越南战争组织”。这个组织于二月五日发起了在白宫前面举行的示威。示威者中的退伍军人和后备役军人，要求把他们的立功绶带、奖章和退伍证书退还给美国总统约翰逊。
    矛头指向约翰逊
    今年以来，美国人民反对侵越战争运动的目标愈来愈明确，斗争的矛头愈来愈直接指向坚决执行侵越战争政策的美国政府及其首脑人物约翰逊。
    二月五日，约翰逊亲自出马前往檀香山，准备同美国军政要员和南越傀儡们一起讨论进一步扩大侵越战争计划。他一走下飞机，就被当地的示威群众所包围，愤怒的人群高呼反对侵越战争的口号，挥动“杀人犯滚回去！”“停止约翰逊战争”等标语牌。二月二十三日，当约翰逊在纽约的华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店鼓吹侵越政策时，七千多名纽约公众不顾警察的阻拦和反动分子的捣乱，在饭店外面举行了盛大的示威，要求美军撤出南越。
    为约翰逊侵越政策四出奔走进行辩解的美国副总统汉弗莱、国务卿腊斯克也遭到示威者的谴责。一月二日，一百五十名檀香山公众，在汉弗莱访问远东回国途中经过檀香山时，举行了示威，抗议侵越政策。一月三十一日，在芝加哥市，一些群众对正在那里为约翰逊恢复轰炸进行辩论的汉弗莱表示抗议。三月十四日，当腊斯克在波士顿谢拉顿饭店发表为约翰逊侵越政策辩解的演说时，一百多人在饭店门前举行了抗议示威。
  黑人积极投入运动
    今年以来，美国人民反对侵越战争运动向黑人人口集中的南方各州深入发展，这是一个新的动向。据今年一月一日一期的《国民前卫》周刊报道，一批来自南部各州的黑人运动领导人和大学师生已于去年十一月在佐治亚州亚特兰大市举行会议，成立了“结束越南战争南方协调委员会”。这个委员会的一位负责人说，现在，在迈阿密、新奥尔良、奥斯汀、圣路易等七个南部城市里，已经成立反对侵越战争的组织，其他一些南部城市也正在积极筹备成立。这位负责人还说，“在南方的许多黑人当中都存在着这种明确的心情，他们将不去替白人打仗。”
    美国黑人运动组织“学生非暴力协调委员会”一月六日在一项公开声明中强烈谴责约翰逊政府的侵越政策，并且号召黑人青年拒绝服兵役。
    二月十二日，“结束越南战争南方协调委员会”在南方十多个城市组织了反对侵越战争示威。这次示威得到了北方和西部一些大城市群众的支持。纽约、洛杉矶、伯克利、费城、波士顿、匹茨堡、芝加哥等城市群众都举行了声援的示威。
    随着反对侵越战争运动的发展，愈来愈多的黑人反对美国统治集团搜罗黑人充当侵越战争炮灰。美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》周报的记者，最近到纽约市黑人“聚居区”——哈莱姆区，进行了一次现场采访，调查普通黑人公众对美国侵越战争所抱的态度。被采访的有黑人工人、失业者、学生、作家和一般居民。他们在谈话中几乎无例外地一致反对黑人替美国统治集团侵略越南战争卖命。一个黑人作家说，“黑人到南越作战就是对自己作战。”　（凡）
