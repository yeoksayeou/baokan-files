    Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, March 10th: Workers in West Bengal, India, held a 24-hour general strike on the 10th, protesting the Indian government's food policy and demanding a judicial investigation into the police shooting and killing of demonstrating students.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 11th: 150,000 construction workers in New Delhi, the capital of India, held a major strike on the 10th, demanding wage increases.

    According to a report in the *Indian Express* on the 11th, "The strike has paralyzed all construction projects and road construction projects of government, military, and private buildings."

    Striking workers also held demonstrations in front of the Chief Labor Commissioner's office.

    Xinhua News Agency, Mumbai, March 11th: The major strike by textile workers in Mumbai, which began on February 28th, entered its fifth day on the 4th. It is reported that the number of strikers has grown from the original 100,000 to 200,000.

    According to a report in the *Patriot*, more than 100,000 textile workers demonstrated in Mumbai on the 3rd in support of the strikers' demands that the management make up for the 1964 bonus and revoke the decision to reduce wages.

    The Indian weekly *Blitz* said that the major strike was caused by the recent closure of a large number of textile factories in Mumbai and the factory's large-scale layoffs of workers, which has left nearly 40,000 textile workers unemployed. The weekly said that in the current situation of soaring prices and material shortages, the factory's announcement to reduce price subsidies by one-third has further deepened the workers' poverty.

    The major strike by textile workers in Mumbai is only part of the struggle of workers across India to protect their right to survive. According to Indian newspapers, worker strikes have been erupting in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar in recent days.

    印度西孟加拉邦工人举行总罢工
    新德里孟买等地数十万工人罢工要求保障生活权利
    据新华社十日讯　加尔各答消息：印度西孟加拉邦工人十日举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议印度政府的粮食政策，要求对警察开枪打死示威学生事件进行司法调查。
    新华社十一日讯　新德里消息：印度首都新德里的建筑工人十五万人十日举行大罢工，要求增加工资。
    据《印度快报》十一日报道，“罢工使政府的、军队的和私人的建筑物的全部建筑工程和筑路工程处于瘫痪状况。”
    罢工工人还在首席劳工专员办事处门前举行示威。
    据新华社讯　孟买消息：从二月二十八日开始的孟买纺织工人大罢工，到四日已经进入第五天。据报道，罢工人数由原来的十万人发展到二十万人。
    据《爱国者报》报道，有十万多名纺织工人三日在孟买市内举行示威，支持罢工者提出的要求资方补发一九六四年奖金和撤销削减工资的决定。
    印度《闪电》周刊说，这次大罢工是由于最近孟买大批纺织工厂关闭和厂方大肆裁减工人而引起的，这使得近四万名纺织工人陷于失业。这家周刊说，在目前物价飞涨和物资缺乏的情况下，厂方宣布削减物价津贴三分之一的决定更加深了工人的穷困。
    孟买纺织工人的大罢工仅仅是印度全国工人为保卫生存权利的斗争的一部分。据印度报纸报道，连日来在北方邦、中央邦和比哈尔邦不断爆发工人罢工斗争。
