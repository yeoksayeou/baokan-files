    Always Take the Masses as Our Teacher
    Ren Jiyu, Professor of Philosophy Department, Peking University
    Summary: During my participation in the socialist education movement in the countryside, I received unforgettable lessons from the peasant masses. This period of social practice was also the most rigorous scientific training for an intellectual like me. I deeply realized the importance of overcoming subjectivism and conducting investigation and research. Staying in the study, the brain is prone to rust, and metaphysics and scholastic philosophy also tend to grow. However, in the fiery revolutionary struggle, metaphysics and scholastic philosophy cannot stand their ground. I felt even more deeply that we must learn from outstanding peasants and outstanding cadres. True knowledge, true wisdom, and the noble qualities of the true working people are all with them, and I will never finish learning in my lifetime.

    In 1965, I had the opportunity to participate in the socialist education movement for eight months, which was better than reading books for ten years. I received unforgettable lessons from the peasant masses.

    One of the major differences between the Marxist-Leninist style of study and the bourgeois style of study is that the former combines theory with practice, while the latter separates theory from practice. For us, the vast countryside, the ideological outlook of 500 million peasants, and the sharp and complex class struggle in the countryside are important realities. Without understanding this reality, there is a danger of making teaching and scientific research divorced from reality. If we cannot see the situation of the current class struggle clearly, we cannot study any problem in the academic field. I study the history of ancient Chinese philosophy and the history of Buddhism, but the purpose is still to serve the great revolutionary reality of the present. Without understanding the present, one cannot understand the past; if one does not understand the "present" deeply and thoroughly, one cannot talk about any in-depth research on the "past"; without understanding the current society, one cannot apply the past to the present. In the past, I also studied policies and cared about class struggle, but I did not feel the power of policies deeply. This time, when I went down to the countryside, I deeply felt that the reason why the Party's policies are powerful and can take root among the masses is that they express the wishes and fundamental interests of more than 95% of the people. Due to the correctness of the Party's policies, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for building a socialist countryside has been mobilized. Now, when I look back and reread Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and policies, I feel particularly kind and clear. If we do not go deep into reality, we cannot understand the Party's policies well, and we cannot do a good job of "applying the past to the present."

    People who have been engaged in teaching and scientific research for a long time always pay attention to the scientific nature, systematicness, etc. of teaching and scientific research. What is a system? How can it be considered scientific? Sometimes it is not so clear. In the countryside, we engage in the socialist education movement, sometimes holding large meetings, sometimes holding small forums, and sometimes having individual heart-to-heart talks with poor and lower-middle peasants. No matter when, if we don't know what people are thinking in their hearts, we can't hold large or small meetings well, and we can't get to the point in individual heart-to-heart talks. If the thinking is right, people will be reluctant to leave even if the meeting is held until midnight and adjournment is announced; if the thinking is not right, people will doze off. Looking back, have our past teachings all been directed at the listeners' doubts or main problems? Sometimes yes, sometimes not necessarily. Has our scientific research been targeted? Sometimes yes, sometimes not necessarily. If the pertinence is stronger, and we can achieve "shooting the arrow at the target" in every task according to Chairman Mao's instructions, today's teaching and course offerings in universities can be greatly simplified. It is entirely possible to remove one-third, or even more, and the length of study can also be appropriately shortened.

    We researchers of ancient philosophical history make analyses and conclusions based on some written records in ancient books. Some people believe that as long as it can be justified, it can stand. Even if the investigation and research are insufficient and do not conform to reality, its errors may not be immediately exposed, and some people even try to defend the wrong views knowing that they are wrong. In this socialist education movement, what we face is living people and real events, so if subjective understanding does not conform to objective reality, we will immediately be rebuffed, and it will truly "echo like a response." In the socialist education movement, in order to verify a task, it is sometimes necessary to conduct repeated investigations and researches, and only after mastering sufficient information can we draw conclusions. The work is serious, but even so, it is inevitable that there will be situations where subjectivity does not conform to objective reality. For an intellectual like me, this is the most rigorous scientific training. "No investigation, no right to speak," this materialist truth has been heard countless times and said countless times. After this period of practice, I feel that no matter how many times I say it, I will not feel redundant. It is both simple and serious, and it is eternally new. I deeply feel that it is still difficult to avoid making mistakes in judging what my own eyes and ears have personally touched, and for those figures and political events thousands of years ago, we must conduct thorough investigation and research before we have the right to speak, and we must never "take it lightly." The work of a revolutionary must stand the test of inspection. "Scientific achievements" that cannot stand the test do not count. It is easiest to expose subjectivism in practice. Correcting subjectivism also strengthens Party spirit training. Without overthrowing subjectivism, no work can be carried out smoothly. Scientific research is the same.

    Staying in the study for a long time, the brain is prone to rust, and metaphysics and scholastic philosophy also tend to grow. In the great struggle of the socialist education movement, people's ideological outlook is changing with each passing day. People who could not draw a clear line with capitalism yesterday will draw a clear line today. People who were not active before will become active later. People who originally had poor awareness and called themselves "wooden stakes" will immediately burst out with endless light and heat and become a vital force once their awareness is raised. The production outlook is also changing with each passing day along with the change of people's ideological outlook. The crops in the fields are different every day, the mountains are also changing, the water is also changing, and you can feel the pulse of the Great Leap Forward by reaching out your hand. Encouraged by the hot and thriving situation, metaphysics and scholastic philosophy have to be left behind by the pace of the revolution. Sometimes, I also do some silly things of scholastic philosophy in my work, but after the impact of the revolutionary tide, scholastic philosophy cannot stand its ground.

    I often feel that intellectuals like us have a lot of book knowledge in our minds, but the more book knowledge we have, the narrower our minds become. We lack the lofty ideals of embracing the world, cannot withstand victory, and cannot stand grievances. In the socialist education movement, I came into contact with many outstanding cadres. They wholeheartedly serve the people, work for the collective day and night regardless of remuneration. Wherever there is difficulty, they appear there. They get up early and go to bed late, brave wind and rain, and tread on ice and frost. Sometimes they are so busy that they can't even take a hot meal. The ancient books say that the Duke of Zhou "spit out his food three times during a meal and clutched his hair three times during a bath." The landlord class intellectuals regarded him as a model of a diligent and devoted "sage." Even if the Duke of Zhou was really too busy with official affairs, he was only busy managing the affairs of a slave state and maintaining the interests of a few slave-owning nobles, which was nothing. However, our outstanding cadres in the countryside, with a red heart struggling for the cause of socialism, are selflessly laboring and working. The people's kangs have long been dismantled and repaired, but the cadres' own kangs are sometimes too busy to dismantle and repair; the cadres' private plots are generally planted behind the people. As for fetching water, feeding pigs, cutting grass, and engaging in household sideline production, cadres generally cannot take care of it. When some cadres' wives talk about it, they often complain that their husbands "don't take care of the family." There are three parts of resentment and seven parts of pride in the "complaint." Is there anything difficult to understand about this mood? Thousands of these nameless heroes, under the leadership of the Party, are silently and resolutely engaged in the great cause of changing the world. It is they who support the lives of 500 million peasants and support the building of the people's commune. They are sometimes misunderstood by some people, and some people are even subjected to some inappropriate criticism for a period of time, but they are not discouraged or retreated. They resolutely listen to the Party's words, "wage war on the earth," and do not give in an inch; they stand up for class struggle. They stride forward with their heads held high, facing difficulties, and are worthy of being the pillars of building socialism. As for the noble qualities and infinite creativity of the broad masses, my feelings are like facing high mountains and vast seas, I can't see the top when I look up, and I can't see the edge at a glance! In the socialist education movement, everyone is being educated, but I deeply feel that learning from outstanding peasants and outstanding cadres is extremely beneficial. True knowledge, true wisdom, and the noble qualities of the true working people are all with them, and I will never finish learning in my lifetime.

    Living within the walls of the school for a long time, going to the countryside can really broaden one's mind, broaden one's horizons, and establish great ambitions. In the future, philosophers and social scientists must face the countryside, take root in the countryside, in order to push the research level of our country's social sciences to a new peak.

    永远以群众为师
    北京大学哲学系教授　任继愈
    提要　我在参加农村社会主义教育运动中，从农民群众那里，受到了难忘的教益。这一段的社会实践，对我这样的知识分子来说，也是一次最严格的科学训练。我深深地体会到克服主观主义、进行调查研究的重要性。关在书斋里，脑子容易生锈，形而上学和烦琐哲学也会滋长。但在热火朝天的革命斗争中，形而上学和烦琐哲学就站不住脚了。我更深深地感到，必须向优秀的农民、优秀的干部学习。真正的学问，真正的智慧，真正的劳动人民的高贵品质，都在他们那里，我一辈子也学不完。
    一九六五年，我有机会参加了八个月的社会主义教育运动，胜读十年书。在农民群众那里，受到了难忘的教益。
    马克思列宁主义的学风与资产阶级的学风的重大区别之一是，前者理论联系实际，后者理论脱离实际。对我们来说，广大的农村，五亿农民的思想面貌，以及农村中存在着尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，是一个重要的实际。不了解这个实际，就会有使教学、科学研究脱离实际的危险。对当前的阶级斗争的形势看不清楚，就无从研究学术领域中的任何问题。我研究的是中国古代哲学史、佛教史，目的还是为当前这个伟大的革命实际服务。不了解今，不能懂得古；对于“今”了解得不深不透，对于“古”就说不上有什么深入的研究；不了解当前社会，就无法古为今用。过去我也学习政策，关心阶级斗争，但对政策的威力却感受不深。这次下去，深深感到党的政策之所以强有力，能在群众中生根，就在于它表达了百分之九十五以上的人的愿望和根本利益。由于党的政策的正确，调动了广大群众建设社会主义农村的积极性。现在，我回过头来再读毛主席的有关指示和政策，分外觉得亲切、明确。如果不深入实际，就不能很好地领会党的政策，也就不能很好地做到“古为今用”。
    长期从事教学、科学研究的人，总是要注意教学和科研的科学性、系统性等等。什么是系统？怎样才算科学？有时不是那么清醒。我们在农村，从事社会主义教育运动，有时开大会，有时开小型座谈会，有时找贫下中农个别谈心。不论在什么时候，如果不知道人家心中想的什么，大小会就开不好，个别谈心也说不到点子上去。如果思想对路，开会开到半夜，宣布散会，人们还留恋着不愿意散去；如果思想不对路，人们就会打瞌睡。回想一下我们过去教学是不是也都针对听者的疑难或主要问题了呢？有时是，有时未必是。我们从事的科学研究是不是有的放矢了呢？有时是，有时未必是。如果针对性强一些，按照毛主席的指示，每一项工作中都能做到“有的放矢”，今天大学里的教学和课程的开设，可以大大精简。去掉三分之一，甚至更多些，完全是可能的，学习年限也可以适当缩短。
    我们研究古代哲学史的人，根据古书上的一些文字记载，做出分析、结论，有些人认为只要说得自圆其说，就可以站得住脚。即使调查研究不够，不大符合实际，它的错误也不见得会立刻暴露，甚至有的人明知有错误也力图为错误的观点辩护。这次社会主义教育运动中，面对的是活人活事，因此主观认识不符合客观实际，就会立刻碰钉子，真是“其应如响”。在社会主义教育运动中，为了核实一件工作，有时要进行反复多次的调查研究，掌握充分的资料才能下结论，工作是认真的，即使如此，还难免有主观不符合客观实际的情况发生。对我这样的知识分子来说，这是一次最严格的科学训练。“没有调查就没有发言权”，这一唯物主义的真理不知听过多少遍，说过多少遍。经过这一段的实践，我觉得无论说多少遍，都不会感到重复。它既平易，又严肃，历万古而长新。自己深感当前耳目所亲自触及的，判断时尚难免出差错，对于那些千百年前人物、政治事件，更要充分地调查研究，才有发言权，千万不可“掉以轻心”。一个革命者的工作，要经得起检查。经不起检查的“科学成果”，算不得数。在实践中是最容易暴露主观主义的。纠正主观主义，也就增强了党性锻炼。主观主义不打倒，任何工作都不可能顺利开展。科学研究也是一样。
    关在书斋里久了，脑子容易生锈，形而上学、烦琐哲学也会滋长。在社会主义教育运动的伟大斗争中，人们的思想面貌在日新月异。昨天还和资本主义划不清界限的人，今天就划清了。原来不积极的人，以后就积极起来了。原来觉悟较差，自称为
  “木头桩子”的人，一旦觉悟提高了，就立刻爆发出无穷无尽的光和热，成为生力军。生产面貌也随着人们的思想面貌的改变在日新月异。地里的庄稼，一天一个样子，山也在变，水也在变，伸一伸手就能摸到大跃进的脉搏。在热火朝天的大好形势鼓舞下，形而上学、烦琐哲学，不得不被革命的步伐抛在后头。在工作中有时也干些烦琐哲学的傻事，但经过革命浪潮的冲击，烦琐哲学就站不住脚了。
    常常感到象我们这些知识分子，头脑里书本知识装得不少，但书本知识越多，心胸反而挤得越窄，缺乏胸怀世界的远大理想，经不起胜利，也受不得委屈。在社会主义教育运动中，我接触到许多优秀干部。他们忠心赤胆地为人民服务，不计报酬、夜以继日地为集体工作着。那里有困难，他们就出现在那里。起早贪黑，冒风雨，履冰霜，有时忙得连一口热饭也顾不上吃。古书上说周公“一饭三吐哺，一沐三握发”。地主阶级知识分子把他当成勤劳奉公的“圣人”的榜样。即使周公真正为了公事忙得不可开交，他也不过是忙于管理奴隶国家的政务，维护的不过是少数奴隶主贵族的利益，算不了什么。可是，我们农村中的优秀干部，怀着一颗为社会主义事业奋斗的红心，忘我地劳动着和工作着。群众的炕早已拆修了，干部们自己的炕，有时忙得来不及拆修；干部们的自留地，一般都种在群众的后头。至于家里挑水，喂猪，打草，搞家庭副业，干部们一般说来，是顾不上的。有的干部的妻子谈起来，常诉说自己的丈夫“不顾家”，在“抱怨”中有三分埋怨，七分自豪。这种心情有什么难以理解的呢？千千万万这些无名英雄，在党的领导下，默默地坚决地在干着改天换地的伟大事业，是他们支撑着五亿农民的生活，支撑着人民公社的大厦。他们有时也受到一些群众的误解，有的人甚至在一个时期中受到一些不适当的批评，但是他们不灰心，不退缩，坚决听党的话，向“地球开战”，寸步不让；对阶级斗争，挺身而出。他们昂首阔步，迎着困难前进，不愧为建设社会主义的柱石。至于广大群众的高贵品质和无穷的创造，给我的感受就象面临着高山大海，抬头看不到顶，一眼望不到边！在社会主义教育运动中，人人都在受教育，但自己深深感到向优秀的农民、优秀的干部学习，收益极大。真正的学问，真正的智慧，真正的劳动人民的高贵品质，都在他们那里，一辈子也学不完。
    在学校的围墙里住久了，走进农村，真能使人拓心胸，开眼界，立壮志。今后的哲学、社会科学工作者，必须面向农村，在农村扎下根，才能把我国的社会科学的研究水平推向新高峰。
