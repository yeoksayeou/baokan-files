    Xinhua News Agency, Bogota: On the 10th, youth and students in the Colombian capital held anti-American and anti-dictatorship demonstrations. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism" and "Down with the murderous (government) army," and attacked the local headquarters of the American "Peace Corps" with stones.
    This demonstration is a continuation of the anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles that have been constantly rising in the Colombian capital and other regions since mid-February, after the pro-American reactionary authorities murdered former priest Camilo Torres, who participated in the patriotic armed struggle. The reactionary authorities originally wanted to suppress the people's struggle by killing Camilo, but this bloody crime instead aroused an anti-American and anti-dictatorship wave across the country.
    On the 10th, after holding a mass for Camilo Torres in the capital, Bogota, hundreds of students carried symbolic coffins in a march to the cemetery. The marching crowd held up a huge portrait of Camilo with the words: "Camilo, the answer to your murder is revolution."
    The marching crowd held a gathering at the cemetery. After the meeting, a demonstration march continued, and the marching crowd expanded to more than a thousand people. The demonstrators were filled with indignation. They shouted anti-American and anti-repression slogans and stoned the headquarters of the American "Peace Corps." During the demonstration, the students fought back against the police suppression. Several students were arrested.
    Workers and students in Popayan, the capital of Cauca Province, also held a demonstration march to mourn Camilo when Colombian President Valencia arrived in the city on the 11th, protesting the government's murder of Camilo and demanding that the authorities return Camilo's remains to his family.

    对美帝及其走狗暴行的回答是：进行革命
    哥伦比亚人民示威游行追悼死难烈士
    新华社讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚首都青年学生十日举行反美、反独裁的游行示威。示威者高呼“打倒美帝国主义”，“打倒杀人的（政府）军”等口号，用石块袭击了当地美国“和平队”的总部。
    这次示威，是亲美反动当局杀害了参加爱国武装斗争的前神父卡米洛·托雷斯以后，在哥伦比亚首都及其它地区从二月中旬起不断兴起的反美、反独裁斗争的继续。反动当局原来想通过杀害卡米洛来压制人民的斗争，但是这一血腥罪行反而在全国激起了一个反美、反独裁的浪潮。
    十日，首都波哥大的学生在为卡米洛·托雷斯做弥撒以后，数百名学生抬着象征性的棺材举行了到墓地的游行。游行队伍举着卡米洛的巨幅画象，在画象下写着：“卡米洛，对你被杀害的回答是进行革命”。
    游行队伍在墓地举行了集会。会后继续举行示威游行，这时游行队伍扩大到一千多人。示威者满怀激愤，他们高呼反美、反镇压的口号，用石块打了美国“和平队”的总部。在示威中，学生们反击警察的镇压。有好几个学生被捕。
    考卡省省会波帕延的工人和学生在十一日当哥伦比亚总统巴伦西亚到达这个城市时，也举行了悼念卡米洛的示威游行，抗议政府杀害卡米洛，并且要求当局把卡米洛的遗体交还给他的家属。
