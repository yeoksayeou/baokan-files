    Revolutionary Flames are Burning
    —A Review of the Play "Andean Storm"
    Hu Sisheng
    The comrades of the Drama Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army spent a year, overcame many difficulties, and created and performed "Andean Storm," our country's first eight-act play reflecting the struggle life of the Latin American people. They have done something meaningful.
    The main contradiction in Latin America today is the contradiction between the American imperialists and their running dogs on one side, and the oppressed nations and oppressed people on the other. This contradiction, in many countries, has already escalated into armed struggle. The guerrilla warfare in the mountains of Colombia, the bases in the jungles of Venezuela, the armed uprising in the Dominican Republic, and the bloody struggle in Panama all illustrate a truth: Latin America is a center of the contemporary revolutionary storm. The play "Andean Storm," through the portrayal of a series of characters and conflicts, vividly reveals the main contradictions in Latin America to the audience.
    The two sides of the contradiction, the two sides of the struggle, have clearly defined camps.
    The American imperialist Mole and the local big plantation owner Delasso formed a counter-revolutionary alliance at a time when "the storm is about to break." This is a combination of interests, and also an alliance of master and servant. Delasso needs American support to maintain his exploitative system of big plantations. Similarly, America also needs Delasso's efforts to extinguish the flames of the local people's armed struggle in order to protect America's rule and colonial interests in Latin America. Mole and Delasso, one is the embodiment of American imperialism, and the other is the representative of the big plantation owners; one is the master, and the other is the running dog. They are the two great mountains pressing down on the Latin American people, and the main targets of the Latin American revolution.
    The script has a certain depth in the portrayal of these two characters. Delasso is a vicious and stupid big plantation owner. He acts recklessly in whatever is beneficial to him; he also acts recklessly in whatever is detrimental to him. He neither knows how to use gentle means to ease Professor Barros' anger at American germ warfare experiments, nor can he come up with the trick of "peaceful negotiations" to lure the guerrillas down the mountain. The only philosophy he believes in is the violence of "arresting" and "killing." Such reactionary figures exist in the actual life of Latin America. They often hold two positions, being both plantation owners with large tracts of land and reactionary generals in control of the army. In the endless stream of coup plots in Latin America, in the bloody conspiracies to massacre revolutionary people, these reactionary figures, known as the "gorilla faction," are the agents and henchmen of American imperialism.
    Mole is an American imperialist with some counter-revolutionary experience. He hangs the signboard of the Pan-American United Enterprise Company, but actually acts as the supreme emperor. He can decide who will be the president of this country, and he can also command the army of this country. He knows when to use the hard hand, when to use the soft hand, and when to combine the two. He directed the coup in which "the president will also roll within forty-eight hours"; he mobilized the army to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas in the mountains. He is more cunning and more vicious than Delasso. He knows that America's great enemies are not the presidents and governors who implement reforms, but those "die-hard communists" who are with the workers and peasants. He knows that the revolutionary armed struggle "takes root in the mountains," "that would be terrible." However, the American imperialists always overestimate themselves and underestimate the power of the people. When Mole just finished reading his monologue "Latin America, you and us are inseparable," and was indulging in the dream of self-appreciation, it was the day when the guerrillas completed the preparations for the surprise attack and were about to pronounce their death sentence. Isn't this ending of the play a preview of Latin American history!
    The portrayal of positive characters in the script mainly focuses on two people. One is Bracido, a guerrilla leader who grew up from among the peasants. The other is Bakas, a revolutionary with armed struggle experience.
    Peasants, who account for the majority of the Latin American population, are a main force of the Latin American revolution. Without the participation of the broad masses of peasants who have deep hatred for the old society, it is impossible for the revolution to achieve victory. However, what is equally important or even more important is that without the leadership of the revolutionary party, without the guidance of correct revolutionary theory, and without taking the path of armed struggle, the revolution cannot achieve victory either. The script combines these two aspects well.
    The road of Bracido's growth is essentially the road from spontaneous resistance to conscious struggle. This road is the road of using revolutionary violence to deal with counter-revolutionary violence, that is, the road of organizing guerrillas in the mountains and persisting in armed struggle for a long time. At first, Bracido "couldn't live on," so he went to the city to negotiate with the big plantation owner. However, the result of the negotiations was that Delasso ordered the recovery of their land within five days. The stubborn Bracido answered with his head held high: "We will never leave our land." However, when he returned home, the village house had been reduced to ashes, his mother had been beaten to death, and his family had been destroyed. Bracido was filled with grief and indignation, and issued a cry to kill, to chop, and to avenge.
    Rushing into Delasso's manor and "fighting them to the death" is not the way to liberate oneself, nor can one recover one's land. The arrival of Bakas pointed out to them the bright road of overthrowing the Americans and their running dogs. Once the revolutionary theory is grasped by the masses, the flames of armed struggle will be ignited in the Andes Mountains. This guerrilla team, after setbacks, learned lessons, strengthened its ranks, and tempered itself, and became a great force that made Mole and Delasso, and even Washington, tremble with fear.
    In Latin America, the people who are unwilling to be enslaved by American imperialism are extremely broad, including not only workers and peasants, but also intellectuals, petty bourgeoisie, and patriotic national bourgeoisie, including the devastated Indians. The script reflects this to a certain extent. The awakening of Professor Barros, the involvement of the Indians Buma and Conrad in the struggle, the unemployed opera actor Mario going up the mountain, and the disillusionment of the college student Jimenez, also reflect from different angles the strategic thinking that ninety percent of the people can be united in the anti-American patriotic united front.
    It is difficult for us to create a script reflecting the struggle life of Latin America. Despite this, the comrades of the General Political Department's Drama Troupe, with deep internationalist feelings for the Latin American people and strong hatred for American imperialism, basically reflected the general outline of the Latin American people's revolutionary struggle through the creation and performance of "Andean Storm," and shaped several positive and negative characters with a certain depth. The stage performance also has Latin American characteristics and flavor. All of this is commendable.
    The anti-American patriotic struggles of the Latin American people rise one after another, and the tide is turbulent. However, judging from the overall struggle situation, the task is extremely arduous, the road is tortuous, and the enemy is vicious and sinister. In this respect, the impression left on people is not very profound. In terms of character image shaping, because there are many characters in the entire script, some characters are not portrayed in enough detail, for example, the main positive character Bakas seems a bit weak. In addition, in terms of language, it can be further refined to be accurate, vivid, and lively, and have Latin American colors.
    "Andean Storm" has appeared on the stage, which is welcome. Let the Andean storm in real life come even more violently! (Attached picture)
    Bakas: Look, the Andean storm is coming! It will surely use its great power to wash away American imperialism and their running dogs from the land of Latin America.

    革命烽火在燃烧
    ——评话剧《安第斯山风暴》
    胡思升
    解放军总政话剧团的同志们，花了一年的时间，克服了不少困难，创作并演出了我国第一个反映拉丁美洲人民斗争生活的八场话剧《安第斯山风暴》。他们做了一件有意义的事。
    拉丁美洲当前的主要矛盾，是以美帝国主义者及其走狗为一方，同以被压迫民族和被压迫人民为一方的矛盾。这对矛盾，在许多国家，已经激化为武装斗争的形式。哥伦比亚山区的游击战，委内瑞拉丛林的根据地，多米尼加的武装起义，巴拿马的流血斗争，都说明了一个真理：拉丁美洲是当代革命风暴的一个中心。话剧《安第斯山风暴》，通过一系列人物的塑造和冲突，把拉丁美洲的主要矛盾鲜明地揭示在观众面前。
    矛盾的双方，斗争的双方，营垒是分明的。
    美帝国主义分子摩非和当地的大庄园主德拉索，在“山雨欲来风满楼”的时刻，结成了反革命的同盟。这是一种利害的结合，也是一种主从的同盟。德拉索需要美国的支撑，来维持自己大庄园主的剥削制度。同样地，美国也需要德拉索的奔走，以扑灭当地人民武装斗争的怒火，来保护美国在拉丁美洲的统治和殖民利益。摩非和德拉索，一个是美帝国主义的化身，一个是大庄园主的代表；一个是主子，一个是走狗。他们是压在拉丁美洲人民身上的两座大山，是拉丁美洲革命的主要对象。
    剧本对这两个人物的塑造，有一定的深度。德拉索，是一个狠毒而愚蠢的大庄园主。什么事对他有利，他就蛮干；什么人对他不利，他也蛮干。他既不会用怀柔的手腕，去缓和医学教授巴罗斯对美国细菌试验的愤怒，也想不出“和平谈判”的花招，去诱骗游击队下山。他信奉的唯一哲学就是“抓起来”、“干掉他”的暴力。这样的反动人物，在拉丁美洲的实际生活中是存在的。他们往往是身兼两任，既是拥有大片土地的庄园主，又是掌握军队的反动将领。在拉丁美洲层出不穷的政变阴谋中，在屠杀革命人民的血腥勾当中，这种被称为“猩猩派”的反动人物，就是美帝国主义的代理人和打手。
    摩非，是一个有一定反革命经验的美帝国主义分子。他挂着泛美联合企业公司总经理的招牌，实际上充当了太上皇。他可以决定什么人当这个国家的总统，也可以指挥这个国家的军队。他懂得什么时候要用武的一手，什么时候要用文的一手，什么时候要把两手结合起来。他导演了“四十八小时之内，总统也会滚蛋”的政变；他调动了军队到山区“围剿”游击队。他比德拉索更狡猾，也更狠毒。他知道美国的大敌不是实行改良的总统和州长，而是那些同工人、农民在一起的
  “死硬派的共产党”，他知道革命的武装斗争“在山区扎下根”，“那就太可怕了”。但是，美帝国主义者总是过高估计自己，过低估计人民力量的。当摩非刚念完他那段“拉丁美洲，你和我们形影不离”的独白，陶醉在自我欣赏的美梦里的时候，就是游击队完成突袭准备、要宣判他们死刑的日子。这一戏剧的结尾，难道不就是拉丁美洲历史的预演吗！
    剧本对正面人物的塑造，主要集中在两个人身上。一个是布拉希多，从农民中成长起来的游击队领导者。一个是巴卡斯，有武装斗争经验的革命党人。
    农民，占拉丁美洲人口的多数，是拉丁美洲革命的一支主力军。没有苦大仇深的广大农民参加，革命要取得胜利，是不可能的。但是，同样重要或者更加重要的是，没有革命党人的领导，没有正确的革命理论作指导，不走武装斗争的道路，革命同样不可能取得胜利。剧本把这两个方面较好地结合了起来。
    布拉希多成长的道路，实质上是从自发的反抗，到自觉斗争的道路。这条道路，就是用革命的暴力对付反革命暴力的道路，就是上山组织游击队、长期坚持武装斗争的道路。起初，布拉希多“活不下去”，就进城找大庄园主谈判。可是，谈判的结果，是德拉索勒令五天内收回他们的土地。倔强的布拉希多，昂首回答：“我们决不会离开我们的土地。”但是，回到家里，村舍已经化为灰烬，妈妈被打死，家破人亡。布拉希多满腔悲愤，发出了要杀、要砍、要报仇的呼号。
    杀进德拉索的庄园，“跟他们拼了”，并不是解放自己的道路，也不能收回自己的土地。巴卡斯的到来，向他们指出了打倒美国佬及其走狗的光明之路。革命的理论一旦被群众所掌握，安第斯山脉就燃起了武装斗争的烽火。这支游击队，经过挫折，吸取了教训，壮大了队伍，锻炼了自己，就成为一支使摩非和德拉索，甚至使华盛顿胆战心惊的伟大力量。
    在拉丁美洲，不愿意受美帝国主义奴役的人们是极其广泛的，不仅有工人、农民，还有知识分子、小资产阶级和爱国的民族资产阶级，也包括备受摧残的印第安人。剧本在一定程度上反映了这一点。巴罗斯教授的觉醒，印第安人布马和孔拉多的投入斗争，失业的歌剧演员马里奥的上山，大学生希门尼斯的丢掉幻想，也都从不同的角度，体现了百分之九十的人是可以团结在反美爱国统一战线中的战略思想。
    我们创作一部反映拉丁美洲斗争生活的剧本，是有一定困难的。尽管如此，总政话剧团的同志们，怀着对拉丁美洲人民的深厚的国际主义感情，怀着对美帝国主义的强烈憎恨，通过《安第斯山风暴》的创作和演出，基本上反映了拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的总轮廓，塑造了几个有一定深度的正、反面人物。舞台演出也具有拉丁美洲的特色和风味。这一切都是难能可贵的。
    拉丁美洲人民的反美爱国斗争，此伏彼起，浪潮汹涌。但是，从总的斗争形势来看，任务是极其艰巨的，道路是曲折的，敌人是毒辣阴险的。在这方面，给人留下的印象还不是很深刻的。在人物形象塑造上，由于整个剧本的人物较多，有些人物刻划得还不够细致，例如主要的正面人物巴卡斯，就显得弱了一些。此外，在语言方面，也可以再加提炼，进一步做到准确、鲜明、生动，而又有拉丁美洲的色彩。
    《安第斯山风暴》在舞台上出现了，这是值得欢迎的。让现实生活中的安第斯山风暴来得更猛烈些吧！（附图片）
    巴卡斯：看，安第斯山的暴风雨就要来到了！它必将以它巨大的威力把美帝国主义和他们的走狗们，从拉丁美洲的土地上冲刷得干干净净。
