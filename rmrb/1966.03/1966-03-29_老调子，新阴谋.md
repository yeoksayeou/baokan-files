    Old Tune, New Conspiracy
    Observer

    Recently, U.S. government officials, led by Johnson, have suddenly started talking about "improving" Sino-U.S. relations again. They say things like the U.S. is prepared to take a "more flexible stance" toward China, that the U.S. doesn't want to keep China "isolated from the family of mankind," that the U.S. is keeping "the door open for establishing peaceful relations" with China, that the U.S. "desires" to have "more contact and more exchanges" with China, and that the U.S. "must seize every opportunity to express our friendship to the Chinese people," and so on. In short, it's as if the U.S. ruling clique is really going to change its course on its China policy and live in harmony with the Chinese people. At a time when U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression against China, such a wave of "goodwill" coming from Washington is utterly absurd and ridiculous.

    For sixteen years, U.S. imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of hostility toward China, constantly engaging in aggression and threats against our country. It has forcibly occupied our territory, the province of Taiwan. It has driven the Chiang Kai-shek clique to usurp our seat in the United Nations. It has imposed a blockade and embargo on our country. It has established a series of military bases around our country. It has constantly dispatched agents to engage in subversion and sabotage activities against our country. Its warships and aircraft frequently violate our territorial waters and airspace, conducting military provocations. The actions of U.S. imperialism clearly show that it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. The U.S. government's China policy, from Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy to Johnson, has been consistent. The current Johnson government has not only failed to change its policy of hostility, aggression, and "containment" of China, but has done so more blatantly and rampantly. It openly declares China as the U.S.'s "main enemy," shifts the focus of its global strategy to Asia, intensifies its military deployments to encircle China, and actively plots to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to China. U.S. military and political leaders even openly clamor for a showdown with China. Isn't the set of things that the Johnson government is really doing completely contrary to the set of things that they tirelessly talk about?

    U.S. Secretary of State Rusk said with great seriousness that the U.S. is now going to "adopt a flexible policy" toward China. If this means that the U.S. government fundamentally corrects its past mistakes, then that would be another matter, of course. However, people remember that more than two years ago, the then-Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Hilsman, talked a lot about the "flexibility" of U.S. China policy and said that the U.S. would "open the door" to China. The facts of the past two years have shown that the U.S.'s fundamental policy of hostility toward China remains unchanged, and Hilsman's so-called "flexibility" is just a smokescreen to deceive people. Now that Rusk is repeating the old tune, it is worthless.

    In fact, Rusk himself gave a good annotation to his so-called "flexible policy." He said that, first, the U.S. "is not prepared to hand over" Taiwan; second, the U.S.'s attitude toward the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations cannot "be changed." This means that the U.S. still wants to occupy China's territory; the U.S. still wants to adhere to its hostile attitude toward China. In a word, the U.S.'s China policy is unchangeable. The so-called "flexible policy" is nothing more than wanting the Chinese people to abandon their solemn and just position in the face of the U.S.'s aggression and "containment" policy. Rusk plainly stated: only if "China changes its attitude" will it be "possible to establish peaceful relations." This reveals the inside story of the U.S.'s "flexible" policy.

    However, according to U.S. Vice President Humphrey and others, the U.S.'s China policy will still have an important change, that is, to change from the past so-called "containment through isolation" policy to a policy of "containment without isolation." The Chinese people are listening: The American masters are showing great mercy, and from now on they will no longer "isolate" us. Shouldn't the Chinese people really be grateful?

    The U.S. has already "isolated" China for sixteen years. The U.S. ruling clique has always believed that it is necessary to "contain China through isolation," and that only "through isolation" can China be "contained." According to Johnson and his ilk, China has now become the U.S.'s main enemy. So, isn't there an even greater need for the U.S. to "isolate" China? Also, according to Johnson and his ilk, China is now "frustrated" everywhere and extremely unlucky. So, isn't there an even greater possibility for the U.S. to "isolate" China? Why, at this very moment, is it shouting so loudly about "not isolating" China? Some China experts who testified in the U.S. Senate revealed the truth. They helplessly admitted that "the U.S.'s policy of 'containment plus isolation' implemented for seventeen years has not worked." It turns out that they want to use this to cover up the failure of the policy of "isolating" China.

    In fact, where is the U.S. ruling clique abandoning its policy of "containment plus isolation"? Everyone knows that the U.S. is not only stirring up an anti-China countercurrent all over the world, but also intensifying its efforts to piece together an anti-China front in Asia with Soviet revisionists, Japanese militarists, and Indian reactionaries as its core. All of this shows that U.S. imperialism wants to intensify its policy of "containment plus isolation" toward China. This is absolutely not something that Johnson and his ilk can cover up by singing some "flexible" tunes.

    In order to show their "sincerity" in "improving" Sino-U.S. relations, the U.S. government has recently been making a big deal out of the issue of personnel exchanges between the two countries. It has repeatedly proposed implementing mutual visits by Sino-U.S. journalists, and it has changed its old ways, saying that it will allow American doctors, scientists, and scholars to visit China. The U.S.'s propaganda machine has also been hyping up this issue, as if the U.S. really wants to "ease" its relations with China.

    Everyone knows that the reason why Sino-U.S. relations have been tense for so long is not because there are fewer American doctors coming to China to investigate China's medical and health situation, nor is it because there are fewer Chinese journalists going to the U.S. to report on American lifestyles. The root cause of the tense Sino-U.S. relations is the U.S. government's insistence on an extremely hostile policy toward China, first of all because the U.S. has forcibly occupied China's Taiwan province. As long as the U.S. government does not change its hostile policy toward China, as long as the U.S. refuses to withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, there can be no talk of normalizing Sino-U.S. relations, and there can be no talk of resolving specific issues such as personnel exchanges between the two countries. But what is the Johnson government's attitude? Not long ago, Rusk said categorically, should the U.S. withdraw from Taiwan? "No, we are not prepared to do that." This exposes the trick: The U.S. government's so-called "improvement" of Sino-U.S. relations is just putting on airs and making some small gestures, playing deceptive tricks.

    It must be pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique's recent efforts to put on a posture of "improving" Sino-U.S. relations is a trick of advancing by feigning retreat. The Johnson government is determined to continue expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, continuing along the path of "gradual escalation," and is prepared to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula, and even to China. This adventurous policy of theirs has caused serious unease and widespread criticism both at home and abroad. Therefore, Johnson and his ilk are attempting to use such hypocrisy to appease the public at home and abroad, and to shift the responsibility for the so-called "Sino-U.S. confrontation" onto the Chinese people, in order to cover up the U.S. imperialism's intensifying aggressive deployments against China. This counter-revolutionary two-pronged tactic of the Johnson government certainly cannot deceive people. Is the U.S.'s eastward shift of its global strategic focus and its strengthening of military forces around China preparing to invade China, or is it to "improve" Sino-U.S. relations? Is the U.S.'s active planning to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam without limit intending to have a showdown with the Chinese people, or is it to "improve" Sino-U.S. relations? Did the U.S.'s recent signing of the so-called "Military Status Agreement in China" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang intend to further colonize and militarize China's territory of Taiwan province, or was it to "improve" Sino-U.S. relations? By listening to their words and observing their actions, it is easy for people to see that Johnson and his ilk's so-called "flexible policy," "non-isolation," and "increased contact" are just some of the U.S.'s disguises to intensify its "containment" of China.

    Not only that, but the Washington authorities' "easing" posture has even more far-reaching plans. The U.S.'s power holders do not hide the fact that they have not given up on the "peaceful evolution" of China, and they have always placed their hopes on China's "new generation." They vainly attempt to promote this "evolution" through certain so-called "easing" and "loosening." Washington's mouthpiece, The New York Times, revealed this intention of theirs quite clearly. In an editorial, it wrote: "If the United States adopts a 'open door' policy that expresses a willingness to contact and reconcile, the day when this group of people seizes power may be accelerated." U.S. imperialism thinks that by engaging in a little "contact" and "exchange," it can soften the revolutionary will of the great Chinese people and shake the Chinese people's firm position of opposing U.S. imperialism and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. This is simply a daydream. The U.S. ruling clique spends so much money to gather intelligence on China every day, but their knowledge about China is still equal to zero, which is really sad.

    The Chinese people have seen through the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism will never lay down its butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. Especially today, because the Chinese people are holding high the revolutionary banner against U.S. imperialism, U.S. imperialism regards the Chinese people as the main obstacle to its promotion of its global hegemonic counter-revolutionary global strategy, it will not give up its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people. The Chinese people have a clear head. We are neither afraid of U.S. imperialism's intimidation nor do we believe in U.S. imperialism's "good words." Johnson's government, you should put away your set of tricks as soon as possible.

    The Chinese people have always believed that U.S. imperialism is one thing, and the American people are another. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese people understand that American imperialism has done many bad things to China and many bad things to the world. It is only the American ruling clique that is not good, and the American people are very good." There is a deep friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. We fully understand the American people's desire to resume exchanges with the Chinese people. However, we will not and cannot allow the U.S. ruling clique to use this legitimate desire of the American people to achieve its ulterior motives. We firmly believe that one day, the Chinese and American peoples will surely smash the various conspiracies of the American reactionaries, clear away all obstacles, truly establish close ties, and greatly develop the friendship between our two peoples.

    老调子，新阴谋
    观察家
    最近一个时期，以约翰逊为首的美国政府官员，忽然又大谈起“改善”中美关系来了。什么美国准备对中国“采取较为灵活的立场”啦，美国不想使中国“孤立于人类大家庭之外”啦，美国正使它同中国“建立和平关系的大门敞开”啦，美国“渴望”同中国“有更多的接触和更多的往来”啦，美国“必须利用一切机会向中国人民表示我们的友好”啦，等等。总之，好象美国统治集团真的要在对华政策上改弦易辙了，要同中国人民友好相处了。正当美帝国主义加紧把侵略矛头指向中国的时候，从华盛顿发出这样一片“亲善”之声，这是十分荒唐可笑的。
    十六年来，美帝国主义一贯推行敌视中国的政策，无时无刻不在对我国进行侵略和威胁。它武力霸占我国领土台湾省。它驱使蒋介石集团窃踞我国在联合国的席位。它对我国实行封锁禁运。它在我国周围建立了一系列的军事基地。它不断派遣特务对我国从事颠覆和破坏活动。它的军舰和飞机频繁地侵犯我国领海领空，进行军事挑衅。美帝国主义的所作所为，清楚地表明它是中国人民不共戴天的死敌。美国政府的对华政策，从杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪到约翰逊，是一脉相承的。现在的约翰逊政府，不仅丝毫没有改变敌视、侵略和“遏制”中国的政策，而且做得更露骨、更猖狂。它公开宣称中国是美国的“主要敌人”，把全球战略的重点转移到亚洲，加紧进行包围中国的军事部署，积极策划把侵越战争扩大到中国来。美国的军政头目甚至公然叫嚷要同中国较量一番。约翰逊政府实实在在地干的这一套，同他们喋喋不休地谈论的那一套，岂不是南辕北辙吗？
    美国国务卿腊斯克一本正经地说，美国现在要对中国“采取灵活的政策”了。如果这意味着美国政府痛改前非，那当然是另一回事。但是，人们记得，两年多以前，当时的美国远东事务助理国务卿希尔斯曼就曾大谈过一阵美国对华政策的“灵活性”，表示要向中国“敞开门户”。两年来的事实表明，美国敌视中国的根本政策原封未动，希尔斯曼的所谓“灵活性”，只是掩人耳目的烟幕。现在腊斯克又旧调重弹，那是一文不值的。
    其实，腊斯克本人就对他的所谓“灵活的政策”作了很好的注解。他说，第一，美国“不准备拱手交出”台湾；第二，关于恢复中国在联合国合法席位的问题，美国的态度不能“有所改变”。这就是说，中国的领土，美国还是要霸占；敌视中国的立场，美国还是要坚持。一句话，美国的对华政策是万变不离其宗。所谓“灵活的政策”也者，不过是要中国人民在美国的侵略和“遏制”政策面前放弃自己的严正立场。腊斯克明白宣称：只有“中国改变态度”，才“有可能建立和平关系”。这就把美国“灵活”政策的底细和盘托出了。
    但是，据美国副总统汉弗莱等人说，美国的对华政策还是要有重要变化的，那就是要从过去的所谓“通过孤立进行遏制”的政策，改变为“遏制而不予孤立”的政策。中国人民听着，美国老爷大发善心，从今以后不再“孤立”我们了。中国人民不是真该感激涕零吗？
    美国已经“孤立”中国十六年了。美国统治集团一贯认为，必须“通过孤立”来“遏制中国”，而且只有“通过孤立”才能“遏制中国”。按约翰逊之流的说法，中国现在已经成为美国的主要敌人。那么，美国“孤立”中国不是有更大的必要性吗？又按约翰逊之流的说法，中国现在到处“受挫”，倒霉透顶。那么，美国“孤立”中国不是有更大的可能性吗？为什么偏偏在这个时候，却要大叫大嚷“不予孤立”中国呢？在美国参议院作证的一些中国问题专家道出了原委，他们无可奈何地承认，“美国实行了十七年的‘遏制加孤立’的政策不起作用”。原来他们是想以此来掩盖“孤立”中国政策的失败。
    事实上，美国统治集团哪里是放弃“遏制加孤立”的政策？谁都知道，美国不仅正在世界各地掀起一个反华的逆流，而且加紧在亚洲拼凑一条以苏联修正主义者、日本军国主义和印度反动派为核心的反华阵线。这都表明，美帝国主义是要对中国变本加厉地推行其“遏制加孤立”的政策。这绝不是约翰逊之流唱出一些“灵活”的调头所能掩盖得住的。
    美国政府为了表示他们“改善”中美关系的“诚意”，最近一个时期在两国人员交往问题上大作文章。它一再提出实行中美记者互访，并且一改故态，表示准许美国医生、科学家和学者来中国访问。美国的宣传机器也就这个问题大肆渲染，仿佛美国真是要“缓和”同中国的关系。
    谁都知道，中美关系之所以长期紧张，并不是因为少了几个美国医生到中国来考察中国的医药卫生情况，也不是因为少了几个中国记者到美国去报道美国的生活方式。中美紧张关系的根源，是美国政府坚持极端敌视中国的政策，首先是因为美国用武力侵占了中国的台湾省。只要美国政府不改变敌视中国的政策，只要美国拒绝把它的武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走，就根本谈不上中美关系的正常化，谈不上解决两国人员往来这类具体问题。但是，约翰逊政府抱什么态度呢？就在不久以前，腊斯克斩钉截铁地说，要美国撤出台湾吗？“不行，我们不准备这样做。”这就拆穿了西洋镜：美国政府的所谓“改善”中美关系，只不过是装腔作势地作出一些小动作，玩弄骗人的花招罢了。
    必须指出，美国统治集团最近竭力摆出一副要“改善”中美关系的姿态，是耍的以“退”为进的鬼把戏。约翰逊政府决心继续扩大侵越战争，沿着“逐步升级”的道路走下去，而且准备把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那，甚至扩大到中国。它的这种冒险政策，已在美国国内外引起了严重的不安和广泛的非难。因此，约翰逊之流妄图利用这样一些惺惺作态来安抚国内外人心，并把所谓“中美对峙”的责任推到中国人民头上，为美帝国主义正在加紧进行对中国的侵略部署打掩护。约翰逊政府的这种反革命两手策略，当然是骗不了人的。难道美国把全球战略重点东移，在中国周围加强军事力量，不是准备侵略中国，而是为了“改善”中美关系吗？难道美国积极策划无限制地扩大在越南的侵略战争，不是打算同中国人民较量一番，而是为了“改善”中美关系吗？难道美国最近同蒋介石匪帮签订所谓“在华军事地位协定”，不是要把中国领土台湾省进一步殖民地化和军事基地化，而是为了“改善”中美关系吗？听其言而观其行，人们很容易看出，约翰逊之流的什么“灵活政策”、什么“不予孤立”、什么“增加接触”，都不过是美国为了加紧“遏制”中国的一些幌子罢了。
    不仅如此，华盛顿当局的“缓和”姿态，还有其更深远的打算。美国的当权人物毫不掩饰，他们对中国的“和平演变”并未死心，始终把希望寄托在中国“新的一代”的身上。他们妄图通过某些所谓“缓和”和“松动”，以促成这种“演变”。华盛顿的喉舌《纽约时报》就把他们这种意图相当清楚地透露了出来。它在一篇社论中写道：“如果美国采取一种表示愿意接触和和解‘开门’的政策，这批人掌握政权的日子可能就会加速到来。”美帝国主义以为搞一点“接触”和“往来”，就可以软化伟大中国人民的革命意志，动摇中国人民反对美帝国主义和支持各国人民革命斗争的坚定立场，这简直是白日作梦。美国统治集团花了那么多钱，天天搞中国的情报，他们关于中国的知识还是等于零，实在可悲。
    中国人民对于美帝国主义的侵略本性是看透了的。美帝国主义决不会放下屠刀，立地成佛。特别是今天，由于中国人民高举反对美帝国主义的革命旗帜，美帝国主义把中国人民看成它推行独霸世界反革命全球战略的主要障碍，它更不会放弃敌视中国人民的政策。中国人民有着清醒的头脑。我们既不害怕美帝国主义的恐吓，也不相信美帝国主义的“好话”。约翰逊政府，还是趁早收起你们的这一套吧。
    中国人民从来就认为，美帝国主义是一回事，美国人民又是一回事。毛泽东主席说过：“中国人民懂得，美国帝国主义对中国做了许多坏事，对全世界做了许多坏事，只是美国的统治集团不好，美国人民是很好的。”在中美两国人民之间存在着深厚的友谊。我们完全理解美国人民要同中国人民恢复交往的愿望。但是，我们不会，也不能让美国统治集团利用美国人民的这种正当愿望，来达到它的不可告人的目的。我们深信，总有一天，中国人民和美国人民必将粉碎美国反动派的种种阴谋，扫除一切障碍，真正建立起密切的联系，使我们两国人民的友谊得到巨大的发展。
