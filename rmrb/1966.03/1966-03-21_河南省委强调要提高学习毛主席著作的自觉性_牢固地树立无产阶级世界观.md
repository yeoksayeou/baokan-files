    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently pointed out in an instruction on strengthening the study of Chairman Mao’s works that studying Chairman Mao's works, fundamentally speaking, is to learn Chairman Mao's stance, viewpoints, and methods of observing and handling problems, and to firmly establish the proletarian worldview.

    The instruction calls on the broad masses of Party members and cadres in the province to further raise their consciousness in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to better highlight politics in all work, to use Mao Zedong Thought to take command, to realize ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization, in order to guarantee the victorious completion of the Third Five-Year Plan and to fundamentally change the face of Henan more quickly.

    The instruction pointed out that the current activities of learning from and promoting Comrade Jiao Yulu have pushed the province's movement to study Chairman Mao's works to a new high. However, the current state of learning is still far from meeting the needs of the revolutionary situation. Party committees at all levels must continue to deepen and improve their understanding of the great significance of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and constantly struggle against erroneous tendencies such as detachment from politics and eclecticism.

    The instruction specifically pointed out that in order to overcome the erroneous tendency of emphasizing professional work while neglecting politics, or putting politics on par with professional work, and to establish the viewpoint that politics commands everything, it is necessary to first launch a concentrated debate among all cadres, especially in Party committees at the county level and above, on the relationship between politics and production, technology, and professional work. In the debate, we must use Chairman Mao's statements on politics being the commander, the soul, and political work being the lifeline of all economic work as weapons, closely linking with reality, linking with thinking, and freely expressing opinions and debating extensively around the following three questions. These three questions are: first, the relationship between politics and production, politics and professional work, politics and technology, what is the correct way to arrange them; second, is good production equivalent to good politics, is it true that having production means having everything; third, does eclecticism and the tendency to detach from politics exist?

    The instruction said that according to the principle of creatively studying and applying what is urgently needed, and starting from the current actual situation in Henan Province, the main focus of study in 1966 is on two issues: one is the issue of politics commanding production, technology, and professional work, focusing on solving the problem of eclecticism; the other is the issue of transforming the worldview and ideological revolutionization, focusing on solving bourgeois individualism characterized by "fear" taking precedence, "stability" leading the way, being content with the status quo, and not seeking progress.

    The instruction said that the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is a great ideological revolution movement to re-educate and transform people, a fundamental ideological construction of the Party, and a fundamental guarantee for doing all work well. Leading cadres at all levels of Party committees and departments must place leading the study of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work.

    河南省委强调要提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性
    牢固地树立无产阶级世界观
    据新华社郑州电　中共河南省委最近在一项关于加强学习毛主席著作的指示中指出，学习毛主席著作，从根本上说，就是要学习毛主席观察和处理问题的立场、观点、方法，牢固地树立起无产阶级世界观。
    指示号召全省广大党员和干部要进一步提高活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性，在一切工作中更好地突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现思想革命化和工作革命化，以保证胜利完成第三个五年计划和更快地从根本上改变河南的面貌。
    指示指出，目前正在开展的学习和宣传焦裕禄同志的活动，把全省学习毛主席著作的运动推向了一个新的高潮。但是，目前的学习情况距离革命形势的需要还很远。各级党委还必须不断加深和提高对活学活用毛主席著作伟大意义的认识，并且经常地向脱离政治和折衷主义等错误倾向作斗争。
    指示特别指出，为了克服那种重业务、轻政治或者把政治与业务平列起来的错误倾向，确立政治统帅一切的观点，必须首先在全体干部中，特别在县以上各级党委中，集中地开展一次关于政治与生产、技术、业务关系问题的大辩论。在辩论中，要以毛主席有关政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线的论述作为武器，密切联系实际，联系思想，围绕下列三个问题畅所欲言，大争大辩。这三个问题是：第一，政治与生产、政治与业务、政治与技术的关系，如何摆才是正确的；第二，光生产好是不是就是政治好，是否有了生产就有了一切；第三，是否存在折衷主义思想和脱离政治的倾向。
    指示说，根据活学活用、急用先学的原则，从河南省当前实际情况出发，一九六六年主要学习两个问题：一是关于政治统帅生产、技术、业务问题，着重解决折衷主义的问题；二是关于改造世界观和思想革命化问题，着重解决“怕”字当头，
  “稳”字领先，安于现状，不求进取等资产阶级个人主义。
    指示说，学习毛主席著作运动，是一个重新教育人、改造人的伟大思想革命运动，是党的根本思想建设，是做好一切工作的根本保证。各级党委和各部门的领导干部，都必须把领导好学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。
