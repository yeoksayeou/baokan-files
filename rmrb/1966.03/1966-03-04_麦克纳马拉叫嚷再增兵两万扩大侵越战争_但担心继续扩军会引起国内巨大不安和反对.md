　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara announced at a press conference on the 2nd that the U.S. government will send another 20,000 troops to South Vietnam, bringing the total number of U.S. invading forces there to 235,000.

　　McNamara, who is obsessed with military force, said that the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam could be increased to more than 350,000 without mobilizing reserves. He said that this number is higher than the maximum number of land and air forces deployed in Korea during the U.S. War of Aggression Against Korea.

　　He also said that "if necessary," the United States could send another 21 infantry battalions (approximately 90,000 men) of the Army and Marine Corps to South Vietnam before July 1. He revealed that the United States currently has 43 combat battalions in South Vietnam, most of which are infantry. There are also 20 artillery battalions.

　　According to American newspapers, during the Honolulu Conference held by Johnson in February, U.S. Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland had already proposed to Johnson the requirement to increase the number of U.S. invading forces in Vietnam to 400,000 this year. Johnson said at a recent press conference that he has taken action on Westmoreland's request and will continue to take action. The Johnson government's obsession with military force and its increasingly deeper involvement in the South Vietnam battlefield have caused strong unease among some members of the U.S. ruling clique, who worry that this will disrupt the U.S.'s global strategic deployment, causing it to fall into a state of being unable to attend to everything, thereby leading to unimaginable consequences.

　　At the press conference, McNamara addressed the concerns of these people within the U.S. ruling clique and their criticism of the Johnson government's Vietnam policy, and issued a lengthy statement on the state of U.S. forces in an attempt to reassure people. However, he had to admit that the United States "cannot be without some difficulties."

　　McNamara admitted that if the United States wants to continue to expand its military, it must conscript reserves and extend service periods, which will cause huge unease and reaction in the United States.

　　McNamara specifically addressed the criticism of insufficient ammunition supply for the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam. He indicated that the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam, due to low morale, largely rely on the consumption of ammunition. A large amount of ammunition is either wasted on the battlefield or falls into the hands of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, making the United States the transportation captain for the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.

　　He said, "Our consumption of airborne ammunition alone in February was one and a half times more than the average monthly consumption in the three-year Korean War, and we are prepared to support even higher consumption rates in the coming months."

### 麦克纳马拉叫嚷再增兵两万扩大侵越战争  但担心继续扩军会引起国内巨大不安和反对

    麦克纳马拉叫嚷再增兵两万扩大侵越战争
    但担心继续扩军会引起国内巨大不安和反对
    新华社三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉二日在记者招待会上宣布，美国政府将再增派两万名军队到南越去，这使美国侵越部队的总数很快达到二十三万五千人。
    麦克纳马拉穷兵黩武地说，侵越美军部队可以增加到三十五万以上而不用动员后备队。他说，这个数字比美国侵朝战争时期部署在朝鲜的陆、空部队最高人数还多。
    他还说：“如有必要”，美国在七月一日以前可以再向南越加派二十一个陆军和海军陆战队的步兵营（约九万人）。他透露，美国目前在南越有四十三个战斗营，其中大多数是步兵。另外还有二十个炮兵营。
    据美国报刊报道，在二月间约翰逊举行檀香山会议期间，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰已经向约翰逊提出了在今年把侵越美军增加到四十万的要求。约翰逊在最近的记者招待会上说，他已经就威斯特摩兰的要求采取了行动，并且要继续采取行动。约翰逊政府在南越战场上的穷兵黩武和越陷越深，引起了美国统治集团内部一些人的强烈不安，这些人担心这会打乱美国的全球战略部署，使它陷于顾此失彼境地，从而招致不堪设想的后果。
    麦克纳马拉在记者招待会上针对美国统治集团内部这些人的担忧和他们对约翰逊政府侵越政策的批评，就美国兵力情况发表了长篇声明，力图安抚人心。但是，他又不得不承认，美国“不可能没有一些困难”。
    麦克纳马拉承认，美国要继续扩军，就必须征召后备队和延长服役期，而这将在美国国内引起巨大不安和反应。
    麦克纳马拉特别针对关于侵越美军军火供应不足的批评发表了意见。他表明，侵越美军由于士气低落，在很大程度上依靠于军火的消耗。大批军火不是在战场上浪费了，就是落到了南越人民武装的手里，使美国当了南越人民武装的运输队长。
    他说，“我们二月份消耗的仅仅是空中运载的弹药，就大得比三年朝鲜战争中平均每月消耗的弹药多一倍半，我们准备在今后几个月份里支持甚至更高的消耗率”。
