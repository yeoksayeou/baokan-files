    War Educates the People, The People Will Win the War
    Heroes Emerge in the People's War in South Vietnam, "American Annihilation Warriors" Stage Countless Magnificent Dramas
    (Our dispatch) A mass campaign of "seek out American troops to annihilate, seek out puppet troops to fight" is currently flourishing in South Vietnam. In this enemy annihilation campaign, heroic "American annihilation warriors" are constantly emerging in large numbers.
    In Điện Bàn District, Quảng Nam Province, the heroic militia company commander Trương Văn Hòa, only twenty-four years old, eliminated three American invaders in his first attack, and drew a conclusion from actual combat: "It is the American strongmen who are afraid of us, not us who are afraid of the American bandits!" It was he who, in four months, single-handedly annihilated seventy-eight American invaders with explosives and rudimentary weapons; a three-man guerrilla group in Thừa Thiên Province bravely thrust into the American invaders' nest in Phú Bài in one battle, annihilating ninety-four American bandits in one fell swoop; a thirteen-year-old boy, Đoàn Văn Luyện, from Quảng Ngãi Province, whose height did not even exceed the length of a rifle, cleverly killed fourteen American devils and was hailed as "Little Zhuge"; at the Chu Pong Mountains of Pleime and the Ia Drang Valley, the ethnic minority warrior Si Yin single-handedly killed five American bandits with a dagger in combat; an old man named Vũ Kỵ, already fifty-seven years old, after killing an American invader with a single rifle bullet, guarded the American invader's corpse all night, waiting to strike the American helicopter that came to collect the corpse, and finally hit a helicopter with another bullet, causing it to catch fire and crash, and the three American invaders on board were burned alive.
    At present, the heroic images and glorious examples of the large number of "American annihilation warriors" emerging in various parts of South Vietnam are powerfully encouraging the soldiers of the liberation armed forces and the broad masses of people to annihilate the American invaders with more heroic and tenacious battles. In many places, even the soldiers of entire military units or the guerrillas of entire villages have won the glorious title of "American annihilation warriors." For example, in Bình Sơn Commune, a famous fighting commune in Quảng Nam Province, this commune has annihilated more than five hundred American bandits, and all the guerrillas in the commune have won the title of "American annihilation warrior."

    战争教育了人民  人民将赢得战争
    南越人民战争中英雄辈出，“歼美勇士”演出无数威武活剧
    本报讯　目前在越南南方，“找美国佬歼，找伪军打”的竞赛运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。在这个歼敌运动中不断地大量涌现英勇的“歼美勇士”。
    在广南省奠盘县，年仅二十四岁的英雄的民兵中队长张文和，初次出击就消灭了三个美国侵略者，并从实际战斗中得出结论：“是美国强盔怕我们，而不是我们怕美国强盗！”正是他，在四个月的时间里，一个人用炸药和简陋武器就歼灭了七十八个美国侵略者；承天省的一个三人游击小组，在一次战斗中英勇地猛插美国侵略者在芙拜的巢穴，一举歼灭了美国强盗九十四人；广义省一个身高还未超过步枪长度的十三岁少年段文练，用巧计炸死了十四个美国鬼子，被人们誉为“小诸葛”；在波来梅的朱邦山麓和德浪河谷，少数民族战士西因在战斗中只身以匕首杀死了五个美国强盗；一个名叫武骥的年已五十七岁的老大爷，在以一发步枪子弹打死一个美国侵略者后，又通宵守在这个美国侵略者的尸体旁，等着打击前来收尸的美国直升飞机，终于又以一发子弹击中一架直升飞机，使它起火坠毁，机上三个美国侵略者被活活烧死。
    目前，在南越各地涌现的大批“歼美勇士”的英雄形象和光辉榜样，正在有力地鼓舞着解放武装力量的战士和广大人民以更英勇顽强的战斗去消灭美国侵略者。在许多地方，甚至整个部队单位的战士或整个村庄的游击队员都获得了“歼美勇士”的光荣称号。例如在广南省的一个著名的战斗乡——平山乡，这个乡一共已经歼灭了五百多个美国强盗，全乡所有游击队员都已荣获“歼美勇士”的称号。
