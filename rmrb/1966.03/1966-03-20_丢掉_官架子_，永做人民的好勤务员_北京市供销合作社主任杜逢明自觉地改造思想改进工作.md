    "What are some bad things you are reluctant to discard?"

    In the winter of 1964, Du Fengming put on a faded gray cloth coat, carried a bedroll, and, with Mao Zedong's works in hand, went to the deep mountains of Yanhecheng in Mentougou, a suburban district of Beijing.

    The responsible comrades of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee asked him to conduct a social investigation in the mountainous area. He also wanted to learn about the deeds of Jia Quanyong, an advanced worker at the Yanhecheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative. What prompted him to eagerly go to the countryside was that, after the socialist education movement, his enthusiasm for creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works had increased, and his desire to go deep among the masses and into reality to transform his subjective world had become even more urgent.

    That day he arrived in Yanhecheng, but unfortunately, Jia Quanyong had gone to Shiyangou to purchase fat sheep. Du Fengming decided to follow him all the way to find him. That day, he carried a heavy backpack filled with cotton shoes, rubber shoes, needles, thread, and other small commodities and set off for the mountain village with several other comrades.

    It was getting dark. On the mountain road, the group stumbled forward, one foot high, one foot low, groping their way. Du Fengming occasionally supported his waist with one hand, walking with a limp.

    Du Fengming, forty-four years old, joined the revolutionary work in 1938 and the Communist Party of China in 1939. His back was not feeling well because he had been wounded while fighting guerrillas in the Mentougou mountainous area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. To this day, he still carries eight machine gun bullet scars on his body.

    They groped their way to Xinzhuanghu Village in the dark. Knocking on the door of a poor peasant commune member, Du Fengming stayed overnight on the kang of the poor peasant. The next day, he went to Baiyang Shihucun to sell goods. When he returned to Xinzhuanghu Village, he finally met Jia Quanyong.

    Jia Quanyong spent years going through mountain gullies, traveling from village to village doing business. He wholeheartedly served the construction of the new socialist mountainous area, and the old and young in the mountain villages all regarded him as a family member. He saved his bonus, bought tree saplings, reclaimed wasteland, and cultivated seedlings. Every production team near the supply and marketing store had planted saplings he had given them. He was originally the director of a basic-level supply and marketing cooperative, but later, after the organizational adjustment, he became the person in charge of the supply and marketing store under the basic-level supply and marketing cooperative. He was not afraid of hardship or fatigue, he did not seek fame or fortune, he was only wholeheartedly for the people, wholeheartedly for the revolution.

    Du Fengming traveled with Jia Quanyong through the villages doing business for two days. Wherever they went, the masses gathered around Jia Quanyong, willing to talk to him about any problem: food, clothing, housing. When Jia Quanyong went to the commune members' homes, it was as if he were in his own home. He took off his shoes and sat on the kang, asking this and that, and noting the needs of the masses in his small notebook. Du Fengming, looking at Jia Quanyong's close relationship with the masses, thought to himself: I have been sitting on top for a long time, rarely contacting the masses and reality. What a huge gap! From this excellent grassroots cadre, from this old Party member and advanced worker who was nearly sixty years old, he saw the example of an old revolutionary whose revolutionary spirit had not faded.

    One day, Du Fengming came to Xidatai Village with a backpack and set up a stall to sell goods at a commune member's home. Cotton shoes, rubber shoes, leg straps, headbands, other small commodities, and patent medicines filled the kang. Old and young crowded around to choose and buy, making it very lively.

    Suddenly, an old man wearing a sheepskin coat pushed the door open and came in. The old man carefully looked at Du Fengming, who was doing business on the kang, and excitedly exclaimed: "Old Comrade Du, do you still recognize me?" Du Fengming looked the old man up and down, finding him familiar, but he couldn't remember who he was. The old man said: "Have you forgotten? I stood guard for you!" This reminder brought back to Du Fengming the scene of living in the old poor peasant's shed when he was fighting guerrillas. He secretly blamed himself for forgetting the revolutionary masses who had risked their lives to protect him!

    At dusk, Du Fengming found the old man, Li Zhenggao's, home. The old dilapidated shed was gone; now they lived in a new tile-roofed house. He reminisced about the past with the old man and talked about the present. When the old man talked about the development of production and the improvement of living standards, he was happy from the bottom of his heart. When the old man talked about the difficulties in collective production and the lives of the masses, he felt that he had not done his job well and that the burden on his shoulders was still very heavy. That night, he slept on the same kang with the old man and his son in the old man's house.

    During these few days, Du Fengming lived and ate in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. People took out their new blankets and comforters that they were reluctant to use to cover him, and they cooked fragrant millet porridge and the rare mountain village delicacy, "he le," for him to eat. What he received from the masses was still the same warmth he had received when he was fighting guerrillas in this area. During these few days, he thought a lot, and far ahead.

    He thought about how in the past, wherever the guerrillas fought, the masses were always with them. Whatever the masses ate, he ate too. Millet, wild vegetables, apricot leaves—good or bad, they were always there. The masses sent him messages, provided cover; when he was injured, the masses risked their lives to sneak into the enemy's sentry posts, again and again bringing back the scarce red medicine at the time... Now, the revolutionary masses in the mountainous area had not changed their enthusiasm for him, but what about himself? After entering the city, the working and living conditions were very different from those of the rural masses, he went down to the grassroots level less often, and he had become estranged from the masses! He remembered the passage in Mao Zedong's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party warning Communist Party members: "Because of victory, arrogance, the complacency of being a meritorious official, the desire to stop and not seek progress, the desire to enjoy pleasure and not live a hard life again may grow within the Party." Now, he seemed to hear again the alarm bell Mao Zedong rang in 1949, and he revived his revolutionary spirit.

    Du Fengming did not sleep very soundly that night at Li Zhenggao's house. The next morning, he picked up a big broom and swept the snow on the road from the west to the east of the village. When the villagers saw the cadre with the big broom sweeping snow for everyone, they praised him as a servant of the people. However, just a year earlier, when Du Fengming went to a basic-level supply and marketing cooperative, he saw a lot of snow accumulated in front of the supply and marketing cooperative in the morning. He picked up the big broom and then put it down. Because at that time, he still had the idea that "it would be too demeaning for a big director to sweep snow." At that time, when he first carried a burden to deliver goods to the countryside, he still felt embarrassed; when he first shouted to sell goods, he still felt that it was difficult to speak, and he couldn't get rid of his "official air." Later, he read Mao Zedong's articles and was educated. Mao Zedong said: "All our working cadres, no matter how high or low their positions are, are servants of the people. Everything we do is to serve the people. What are some bad things that we are reluctant to discard?" He gradually realized that he should get rid of his "official air." This time, coming to Yanhecheng, the grassroots cadres and revolutionary masses educated him again, making him more clearly realize how to better be a servant of the people.

    Now, Du Fengming often talks to the cadres around him about this experience: To maintain a strong revolutionary will and always be a thorough revolutionary, one must conscientiously and creatively study and apply Mao Zedong's works. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must go deep into reality, deep among the masses, learn in practice, learn from the masses, learn and apply simultaneously, and integrate learning with application. Only in this way can we continuously transform our subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world.

      "Don't be like a lame man hunting—shouting from a sitting position!"

    In the past year or so, Du Fengming has often said to the cadres around him: "Don't be like a lame man hunting—shouting from a sitting position!" To be a servant of the people, one must move one's legs diligently, go to the masses, go to reality, and work in a down-to-earth manner. He regards this as an important step in preventing and overcoming subjectivism and bureaucratism.

    In the past two years, Du Fengming has often appeared in front of the masses as an ordinary worker. When he goes to the grassroots level, he sells goods, purchases goods, loads goods, unloads goods, carries water, helps with cooking, wipes shelves, sweeps the yard, cleans toilets—he does everything. Through staying at selected points, participating in labor, and conducting investigations and research, he has both promoted his own ideological transformation and promptly discovered and solved problems, improving his leadership work.

    At one point, Du Fengming heard cadres below constantly complaining that waste material purchases were not coming up. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent out notices and held meetings, urging and talking about it, but the situation of waste material purchases did not change much. What was the problem?

    Du Fengming decided to personally go to the villages to purchase waste materials, to put it into practice, according to Mao Zedong's teachings in "On Practice."

    He came to the Xiji Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tongxian, a suburban county. One morning, he and the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative loaded two wheelbarrows full of commodities and small farm implements and took the purchasing wooden boxes and sacks straight to Dahuadian Village. The wind was very strong that day, and the wind carried sand, hitting people in the face.

    When they arrived at their destination, they set up a stall at Dahuadian Village Elementary School. The wind and sand continued to blow relentlessly. Others advised Du Fengming to stay inside the windproof room to guard the commodity stall, but he insisted on staying outside by the wooden boxes and sacks to manage the purchasing work.

    More than an hour passed, and there were many people buying goods, but no one selling waste materials. Only people came to sell eggs and hides.

    Du Fengming asked the purchaser: "Why isn't anyone coming to sell waste materials?"

    The purchaser said: "Farmers don't have the habit of selling waste materials; there's nothing to purchase!"

      "Don't they even have old shoes?"

      "Old shoes are all burned for fuel!"

    Du Fengming tried shouting with some doubt: "Collecting junk! Collecting junk!" "Buying old shoes and socks!"

    This shout brought in a large number of people selling waste materials. That day, they purchased more than 300 jin of scrap copper, rotten iron, old shoes, socks, and pieces of cloth in this village alone.

    Was it only in Dahuadian Village that there were waste materials to purchase?

    The next day, Du Fengming and several others went to Yinhe Village. As soon as they set up their stall, they went door-to-door shouting "Collecting junk." When the commune members were taking a break, the waste material purchasing stall was crowded with people. Two people were weighing, and one person was paying, and they still felt overwhelmed.

    Du Fengming was busy weighing when he suddenly heard the purchaser in charge of payment shouting at people: "These old shoes won't be accepted. Take them back and remove the nails before coming again!" It turned out that old cloth shoes with iron nails could not be used as raw materials for paper making without removing the nails. But asking people to remove the iron nails before selling old shoes would not earn them much money and would be a lot of trouble, so they might not sell them. Wasn't this blocking the source of waste materials? Later, Du Fengming decided to purchase the old shoes with iron nails. At the same time, he made a note in his mind: To strengthen the purchase of waste materials, it is not only necessary to solve the ideological problems of the staff but also to solve practical problems such as the processing of waste materials.

    Du Fengming purchased "junk" for two days and had a real say in how to strengthen the purchase of waste materials. Immediately afterward, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative issued a "Notice on Distributing 'Looking at the Purchase of Waste Materials Through a Down-to-the-Countryside Sales Trip'" to the supply and marketing cooperatives of various districts and counties. Many of the very pertinent opinions put forward in the notice aroused strong reactions among the staff. The news that the director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the countryside to collect "junk" also spread quickly like wildfire. With the director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative taking the lead, the leading cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels followed suit and went down to the countryside to purchase, sweeping away some of the ideological obstacles of the staff who disliked being dirty and tired and were unwilling to do the small business of purchasing waste materials. They also effectively solved some practical problems in the purchasing work, greatly increasing the amount of waste materials purchased in the rural areas of Beijing.

    Du Fengming's change from sitting in the office calling for the purchase of waste materials to personally going down to shout "Collecting junk" was a revolutionary change in his leadership work. He realized that in the past, when he went down to guide the work, he mostly just wandered around, looked, listened, and talked. He would say a lot to people with just a glance, and many things he said were not to the point. Without doing good investigation and research, he exercised the right to speak, and the cadres below reflected: The director likes to nitpick and criticize people, but he can't solve much problem. Now, after practicing and doing investigation and research himself, he has a real say; as a leading cadre, he has real leadership in front of the employees being led.

    Du Fengming knew that as the director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it was impossible and unnecessary for him to "do everything himself." According to the teachings of "On Practice," it is also very necessary to correctly use secondary data and attach importance to indirect practice. While he himself took the lead in going deep into reality and among the masses, he also organized the cadres of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative to go down to selected points to work and conduct investigations and research, and used this to promote the revolutionization of the agency.

    In the summer of 1965, Du Fengming discovered at the food factory of the Tongxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative that the finished product rate of noodles was low, resulting in losses. After he roughly clarified the crux of the problem by following the shifts and working, he called Liu Shixun, a cadre of the production section of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and asked him to continue staying at the noodle workshop, participate in labor in each process, and further conduct investigation and research, and mobilize the masses to thoroughly solve the problem.

    Liu Shixun also came down with Mao Zedong's works in hand. In the workers' dormitory, he studied the standpoint, viewpoint, and methods from Mao Zedong's works. In the workshop, he worked with the workers and jointly studied the causes and solutions of affecting the quality of noodles. After three weeks of staying at selected points, he not only solved the problems of this factory but also summed up the experience of improving the quality of noodles. Later, this experience was promoted at the noodle production meeting of the entire suburban supply and marketing cooperative system.

    The cadres of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative are striding forward on the road of staying at selected points to work, going deep into reality, and going deep among the masses, paved by Du Fengming's lead. In the past, cadres from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the countryside to conduct investigations and research with "three more and three less," that is, more ordinary cadres went down, less leading cadres went down; more people went to county towns and market towns, fewer people went to remote mountainous areas; more people went down to listen, watch, and wander around, fewer people participated in labor. Now, more leading cadres are going down, more people are going to remote mountainous areas, and more people are going down to participate in labor. The phenomenon of relying excessively on meetings, reports, and official documents to lead work has also been transformed.

        "Light a lamp, and illuminate a large area"

      "Without the correct leadership method, it is impossible to achieve correct leadership." In order to solve the problem of the "bridge" and "boat" for "crossing the river," Du Fengming learned and applied the leadership method of "combining the general and the individual" proposed by Mao Zedong. In the past two years, he has paid close attention to discovering typical examples, summing up experience, establishing banners, and driving the general; and in the process of promoting advanced experience "from point to surface," he has paid attention to discovering typical examples, summarizing experience again, establishing banners again, and driving the general again. Each cycle has improved by one step, so that the work is constantly progressing. He said: An important task of leaders is to constantly turn matter into spirit and spirit into matter to promote the work forward step by step. This is the conclusion he has drawn from his own practice, and it is also an important experience he has gained from creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works.

    At the end of 1964, Du Fengming went to the Labagoumen Supply and Marketing Store in the mountainous area of ​​Huairou County to conduct an investigation. Some of the masses reflected that it was inconvenient to buy and sell things. It took two "full of stars" to go to the supply and marketing store from remote places: one "full of stars" when setting out early in the morning, and another "full of stars" when returning in the evening.

    How to solve the problem? In January 1965, Du Fengming went to the "Backpack Store" - the Huangshandian Supply and Marketing Store in Fangshan County, a suburb of Beijing. He intended to find the answer to the problem there.

    Du Fengming had long heard the cadres below say that the "Backpack Store" was a revolutionary store. A few months ago, he had also sent cadres down to summarize its experience and printed 5,000 copies of a pamphlet introducing the experience of the "Backpack Store." Some units only read the pamphlet to the employees, and some units even lost the pamphlet. The experience of the "Backpack Store" has not been promoted. At that time, Du Fengming only read the written materials of the "Backpack Store." He did not truly realize the universal guiding significance of this advanced typical example. He did not make up his mind to promote it. He studied Mao Zedong's "On Practice," and according to the spirit of knowing the taste of a pear by "eating it in person," he now came to backpack in person.

    The first time he backpaked in the "Backpack Store," he went to the most remote Hulushed Village. The last few miles of mountain road to Hulushed Village seemed particularly long, and the backpack was also particularly heavy. Du Fengming supported his injured waist again. No one in the group was not panting from exhaustion. Sweat dripped from their bodies and heads, and a layer of white frost hung on their eyebrows when the cold wind blew. Du Fengming personally tasted the feeling of backpaking up the mountain here. He thought to himself, "The comrades of the 'Backpack Store' are wholeheartedly thinking of the people in the mountainous areas and backpaking up the mountain to do business year after year, eating great hardships, enduring great labor, and not being afraid to put in hard work. What a precious revolutionary spirit is in this!" With this revolutionary spirit, are you still afraid of not doing a good job?

    The next day, Du Fengming and Wang Yanxiang, the person in charge of the "Backpack Store," backpaked together to Changliushui Village to do business. A child brought some goat bones to sell. Du Fengming said: "Sell them when you have accumulated more!" Wang Yanxiang took over and said: "Little friend, let me take a look." Then, Wang Yanxiang turned around and said to him: "These few bones are worth a few cents. Let's take them. The masses can use them to buy something they need." The child indeed used the four cents to buy a pencil. Du Fengming felt ashamed. He did not think as carefully as Wang Yanxiang. How considerate Wang Yanxiang was to the masses! Isn't this the mass viewpoint of the "Backpack Store" and the revolutionary spirit of the "Backpack Store"?

    Du Fengming made up his mind to raise the red flag of the "Backpack Store" high.

    In the second month of the new spring, Du Fengming brought Mao Zedong's works to the "Backpack Store" and convened the directors of the supply and marketing cooperatives of various districts and counties and some grassroots supply and marketing cooperative cadres to hold a three-day meeting here. He did not prepare a big report for everyone; he prepared backpacks filled with goods for everyone. On the first day, Du Fengming took the lead in carrying a backpack, and let the dozens of people who came to the meeting divide into several groups to follow the people of the "Backpack Store" up the mountain. While doing business, they listened to the reflections of the commune members in the mountainous areas and learned about the revolutionary spirit of the "Backpack Store" on the ground. On the second day, Du Fengming took out Mao Zedong's works, organized everyone to study "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and invited Wang Yanxiang to introduce the situation of the "Backpack Store." On the third day, they held a discussion, connected with reality, compared themselves with the advanced, and looked for gaps. The questions of whether to believe or not to obey that had hindered the promotion of the experience of the "Backpack Store" were solved through practice this time. In this way, Du Fengming cleared the way for the revolutionary spirit of the "Backpack Store," calling on the staff of the city's supply and marketing cooperatives to learn from the "Backpack Store" and take the road of the "Backpack Store."

    Did the work end when the leaders issued the call? Du Fengming thought: Mao Zedong said in "Methods of Work of Party Committees" that the work should be grasped tightly, "Grasping without tightening is equivalent to not grasping." He raised his ideas to the Party committee of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative for discussion, and the Party committee decided to organize more than half of the cadres of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative to go down immediately to grasp the promotion of the experience of the "Backpack Store."

    Du Fengming also took the lead in going deep into the grassroots level to directly understand the situation and problems in promoting the experience of the "Backpack Store." He came to a supply and marketing cooperative in Shunyi County, a suburb of Beijing, where the promotion of the experience of the "Backpack Store" had not yet been put on the agenda. The director of this grassroots supply and marketing cooperative believed that the plains area did not need to learn from the "Backpack Store" in the mountainous area. However, the cadres of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative staying here at selected points went down to the villages to do business and found that the masses in the plains area also welcomed the method of door-to-door sales. Why couldn't the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative here see the needs of the masses? Du Fengming concluded: The director of this grassroots supply and marketing cooperative lacked the revolutionary spirit of learning from the advanced.

    The materials reported by a large number of cadres from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, from various districts and counties in the suburbs and many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, also showed that the key to promoting the experience of the "Backpack Store" was indeed in the leading cadres.

    Du Fengming then gathered the leading cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives of various districts and counties in the suburbs to study Mao Zedong's articles such as "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Methods of Work" and "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" to see what Mao Zedong said and how he did it himself. Du Fengming asked the leading cadres at all levels of the supply and marketing cooperative to go deep down, break through a point, and drive the general.

    Soon, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee made a decision, calling on all commercial personnel in the city to learn from the "Backpack Store." More and more leading cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Beijing personally grasped the "points," and the revolutionary spirit of the "Backpack Store" was quickly carried forward in the supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing.

    In the process of learning and promoting the experience of the "Backpack Store," new experiences emerged. Many units caught up with and surpassed the "Backpack Store" in some aspects. The Zhangxizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shunyi County, a suburb of Beijing, was a more prominent example.

    Du Fengming then slept on the floor with more than 100 people in Zhangxizhuang, and a three-day on-site meeting was held in the Zhangxizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative. He spoke to the people attending the meeting about the experience of the Zhangxizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative. He asked people to correctly resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward like the Zhangxizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative: see the weak links in the advanced, overcome the weak links, and make the advanced more advanced; see the positive factors in the backward, carry forward the positive factors, and make the backward become advanced, and constantly promote the work forward.

    In this way, the mass movement to learn and promote the experience of the "Backpack Store" has added new impetus. More and more advanced collectives like the "Backpack Store" have emerged in the supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing. Now, among the one thousand and several hundred units in the suburban supply and marketing cooperative system, there are already one hundred and several dozen advanced units.

    "Light a lamp, and illuminate a large area." Du Fengming is such a leading cadre who is good at making the lights brighter and brighter. He believes that in the process of promoting advanced experience, it is necessary to oppose subjectivism and metaphysical thought, to oppose bureaucratic methods, to advocate dialectical materialism thought, and to advocate methods of going deep among the masses and deep into reality. This is the struggle between two kinds of thought and two kinds of methods in leadership work. Use Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, or use some other thought as the commander? This is the essence of the question.

    Du Fengming gave a clear answer with his own practical actions: As a leading cadre, whether it is to transform his own thinking or to improve leadership work, he must use Mao Zedong Thought as the commander. In his own words, that is: Thousands of lines, tens of thousands of lines, using Mao Zedong Thought as the commander is the first line!

    Du Fengming has just taken a new step on the road of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. He said that he must look at himself with the view of dividing one into two, that the second half of his life has a long way to go and heavy responsibilities, and that he must continue the revolution; to make revolution for a lifetime, he must study for a lifetime and transform himself for a lifetime.

    丢掉“官架子”，永做人民的好勤务员
    ——北京市供销合作社主任杜逢明自觉地改造思想改进工作
    “有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”
    一九六四年冬天，杜逢明披上褪了色的灰布大衣，背上一个铺盖卷儿，带着毛主席著作，到北京郊区门头沟沿河城深山里去了。
    北京市委负责同志叫他到山区做社会调查。他也想了解一下沿河城供销社先进工作者贾全用的事迹。促使他急于下乡的另一个原因是，经过社会主义教育运动，活学活用毛主席著作的积极性提高了，深入群众，深入实际，来改造自己主观世界的心情更加迫切了。
    这天到了沿河城，不巧贾全用到石岩沟收购肥羊去了。杜逢明决定一路跟踪寻去。当天，他背上一个盛了棉鞋胶鞋和针头线脑等小百货的沉重的背篓，和另外几个同志一起奔向山村。
    天黑了下来。山路上，一行人，高一脚，低一脚，摸索着前进。杜逢明不时用一只手支撑着腰，一瘸一瘸地走着。
    杜逢明，四十四岁，一九三八年参加革命工作，一九三九年加入中国共产党。现在他的腰板不得劲，是因为抗日战争时期在门头沟这一带山区打游击的时候，曾经负过伤，挂过花。至今，他身上还有八颗机枪子弹的伤痕。
    摸黑到了新庄户村。敲开贫农社员的门，杜逢明就住在贫农炕头上过夜。第二天，又到白羊石虎村卖货。等转回新庄户村的时候，才见到了贾全用。
    贾全用常年钻山沟，挨村转游着做买卖。他为建设社会主义新山区尽心尽力，山村老老少少也都把他当亲人。他把自己得的奖金，攒下来，买了树种，开块荒地，培育树苗，供销店附近每个生产队都栽了他送的树苗。他原来是基层供销社主任，后来调整机构，当了基层供销社下面的供销店的负责人。他不怕苦，不怕累，不求名，不图利，只是一心为人民，一心为革命。
    杜逢明同贾全用一道串村做了两天买卖。走到哪里，哪里的群众就围拢到贾全用的身边，吃的问题、穿的问题、住的问题，什么问题都乐意对他说。贾全用到了社员家里，象到了自己家里一样，一脱鞋便上炕头，问这问那，把群众的需要都记在小本本上。杜逢明看着贾全用同群众亲如一家的情景，心里想：自己呢，长期坐在上面，很少联系群众，联系实际，这是多大的差距啊！他从这位优秀基层干部的身上，从这位年近六十的老党员、老先进工作者身上，看到了老革命不褪色的榜样。
    有一天，杜逢明背篓来到西大台村，在一户社员家里摆摊售货。棉鞋呀，胶鞋呀，腿带呀，头绳呀，还有其他小百货和成药，摆满了炕头。老老少少围着选购，分外热闹。
    忽然，一位穿光板羊皮大衣的老人，推门进来。老人端详一阵正在炕上做买卖的杜逢明，兴奋地叫道：“老杜同志，你还认识我吗？”杜逢明上下打量老人，觉得面熟，却怎么也想不起他是谁了。老人说：“你忘了？我给你放过哨哩！”这一提醒，使杜逢明回忆起当年打游击时住这位老贫农的草棚的情景。他暗暗责备自己，怎么竟忘了曾用生命掩护过自己的革命群众呢！
    掌灯时分，杜逢明找到这位老人李正高家。过去的烂草棚已经不见了，现在住的是新瓦房。他同老人重温过去，畅谈现在。当老人说到生产发展和生活改善的情景的时候，他打心眼里高兴；当老人说到集体生产和群众生活还有一些困难的时候，他又感到自己工作还没有做好，肩上担子还很重。当晚，他就在老人家同老人的儿子在一个炕上睡下。
    这几天，杜逢明住在贫农下中农家里，吃在贫农下中农家里。人们拿出自己舍不得盖的新毛毯、新棉被给他盖，做香喷喷的小米饭和山村少有的“饸饹”给他吃。他从群众那里得到的，仍是当年在这一带打游击的时候所得到的那种温暖。这几天，他想得很多，很远。
    想当年，打游击打到哪里，哪里就有群众同自己在一起。群众有什么吃，自己就有什么吃，小米、野菜、杏叶，好好歹歹总是少不了。群众给自己送消息，打掩护；自己受了伤，群众冒着生命危险混进敌人岗楼，一次又一次弄来当时十分难得的红药水……。如今，山区革命群众对自己的热情没有变，可是自己呢？进了城，工作条件、生活条件同农村群众差别大了，迈开两腿深入基层少了，和群众疏远了！他想起毛主席在党的七届二中全会上告诫共产党员的那段话：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”现在，他好象重新听到了毛主席在一九四九年敲起的警钟，振奋起了革命精神。
    杜逢明在李正高家这一夜，睡得特别不踏实。第二天一大早，就操起一把大笤帚，从村西到村东扫路上的积雪去了。村里群众看到拿个大笤帚为大家扫雪的干部，称赞他是人民勤务员。可是，就在一年以前，杜逢明到一个基层供销社去，早晨起床看见供销社门前积着不少雪，他操起大笤帚又放下了。因为那时候，他还有“大主任扫雪多寒伧”的念头。当时，他第一次挑着担子下乡送货，还觉得不好意思；第一次吆喝卖货还觉得不好开口，有点丢不掉“官架子”。后来，他又读毛主席的文章，受到了教育，毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”他渐渐觉悟过来了，认识到应当把“官架子”丢掉。这次来到沿河城，基层干部和革命群众又教育了他，使他更清楚地认识到应当怎样更好地当一个人民勤务员。
    现在，杜逢明经常向周围的干部谈起自己这样一点体会：要想使自己保持旺盛的革命意志，永远做彻底的革命派，就必须认真地活学活用毛主席著作；而要真正把毛泽东思想学到手，就必须深入实际，深入群众，在实践中学，向群众学，边学边用，学用结合。这样，才能在改造客观世界的过程中，不断改造自己的主观世界。
      “不能瘸子打围——坐着喊！”
    近一年多来，杜逢明常跟周围的干部讲：“不能瘸子打围——坐着喊！”当一个人民勤务员，就得勤迈两腿，到群众中去，到实际中去，脚踏实地去干。他把这当作防止和克服主观主义和官僚主义的重要一着。
    这两年，杜逢明经常以一个普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前。他到了基层，卖货，收购，装货，卸货，挑水，帮厨，擦货架，扫院子，掏厕所，什么都干。他通过蹲点，参加劳动，调查研究，既推动了自己的思想改造，又及时发现和解决了问题，改进了自己的领导工作。
    有一个时候，杜逢明听到下面干部老嚷嚷废旧物资收购不上来。市供销社又是发通知，又是开会，催来催去，讲来讲去，废旧物资收购情况还是没有多大改变。问题究竟在哪儿呢？
    杜逢明决定按照毛主席在《实践论》中所教导的那样，亲自下村收购废旧物资，去实践实践。
    他来到郊区通县西集供销社。这一天早晨，他同供销社职工一道装满两辆双轮手推车的百货、小农具，还带上收购用的木箱和麻袋，直奔大灰店村去。这天风很大，风卷着沙，扑面打人。
    到了目的地，他们便在大灰店村小学校摆开货摊。风沙还是一个劲地刮来。别人劝杜逢明到避风的屋里边守百货摊，他却执意守在门外的木箱、麻袋边管收购工作。
    一个多钟头过去了，买货的人倒不少，卖废旧物资的人却一个也没有，只有来卖鸡蛋和皮张的。
    杜逢明问收购员：“怎么没有人来卖废品？”
    收购员说：“农民没有卖废品的习惯，没有什么可收购的！”
      “难道旧鞋也没有吗？”
      “旧鞋都烧了火啦！”
    杜逢明将信将疑地试着吆喝起来：“收破烂！收破烂！”“收购旧鞋烂袜子啊！”
    这一吆喝，唤来了大批卖废旧物资的人。这一天，在这个村就收购了破铜、烂铁、旧鞋、烂袜子、碎布条等三百多斤。
    是不是唯独大灰店村有废旧物资可以收购呢？
    第二天，杜逢明他们几个人又到尹家河村去。他们一摆开货摊，就挨门挨户地去吆喝“收破烂”。社员们歇晌的时候，废旧物资收购摊前挤满了人。他们两个人掌秤，一个人付款，还嫌忙不过来。
    杜逢明正忙着掌秤，忽听得负责付款的那个收购员对人嚷嚷：“这旧鞋不收，拿回去把钉子拔了再来！”原来旧布鞋上有铁钉的，不拔掉不能做造纸原料。可是叫人拔了铁钉再来卖旧鞋，卖钱不多，费事不小，人家就可能不卖了。这不是堵塞废旧物资的货源吗？后来，杜逢明作主还是把带铁钉的旧鞋收购下来了。同时，他脑子里挂上了一个号：加强废旧物资收购工作，不仅要解决职工的思想问题，还要解决废旧物资加工等实际问题。
    杜逢明收购了两天“破烂”，对于如何加强废旧物资收购工作有了真正的发言权。紧接着，市供销社向各区县供销社发出了“关于印发《通过一次下乡售货看废旧物资收购工作》的通知”。通知中提出的许多非常中肯的意见，在职工中反应很强烈。市供销社主任下乡收“破烂”的消息，也象长了翅膀一样，飞快地传开了。市供销社主任走在头里，下面各级供销社领导干部也跟着纷纷下乡收购，横扫了一些职工嫌脏怕累、不愿做收购废旧物资小买卖的思想障碍，并且切实解决了收购工作中的一些实际问题，使京郊农村废旧物资收购量大幅度增长。
    杜逢明由坐在办公室号召收购废旧物资，到亲自下去吆喝“收破烂”，这是他领导工作上的一个革命性的变化。他体会到，过去下去指导工作，多是转转，看看，听听，说说。看一眼，就对人家说一通，好些事都说不到点子上。没有很好地做调查研究就行使发言权，下面干部就反映：主任爱抠问题批评人，解决不了多大问题。现在，经过实践，亲自做了调查研究，也就有了真正的发言权；作为一个领导干部，在被领导的职工面前，也就有了真正的领导权。
    杜逢明知道，作为一个市供销社主任，不可能也没有必要“事必躬亲”。按照《实践论》的教导，正确运用第二手资料，重视间接的实践，也是十分必要的。他一面自己带头深入实际，深入群众，一面组织市供销社的干部下去蹲点劳动，进行调查研究，并且以此促进机关的革命化。
    一九六五年夏天，杜逢明在通县供销社食品厂发现挂面成品率低，造成赔钱的问题。他通过跟班劳动，大体搞清问题的眉目以后，把市供销社生产科的干部刘世勋找来，要他继续在挂面车间蹲点，一个工序一个工序地参加劳动，进一步做调查研究，发动群众来彻底解决问题。
    刘世勋也是带着毛主席著作下来的。他在工人宿舍里，从毛主席著作中学习立场、观点、方法；他在车间里，和工人一起劳动，共同研究影响挂面质量的原因和解决办法。经过三个星期蹲点，不仅解决了这个厂的问题，还总结出了提高挂面质量的经验。后来，这个经验在全郊区供销社系统的挂面生产会议上推广了。
    北京市供销社的干部，正在杜逢明带头踩出的蹲点劳动、深入实际、深入群众的道路上大踏步前进着。过去，市供销社机关干部下乡调查研究有“三多三少”。即一般干部下去的多，领导干部下去的少；去县城集镇的多，去偏僻山区的少；下去听、看、转的多，参加劳动的少。现在，领导干部下去的多了，到偏僻山区去的多了，下去参加劳动的多了。过去那种过分靠会议、靠表报、靠公文领导工作的现象，也转变过来了。
        “拨亮一盏灯，照红一大片”
      “没有正确的领导方法，就不可能实现正确的领导。”杜逢明为了解决“过河”的“桥”和“船”的问题，学习和运用毛主席提出的“一般和个别相结合”的领导方法。近二年来，他很注意发现典型，总结经验，树立旗帜，带动一般；并且在这个“由点到面”推广先进经验的过程中，又注意发现典型，再总结经验，又树立旗帜，再带动一般。如此每一次循环，都提高一步，使工作不断地有所前进。他说：领导者的一个重要任务，就是要这样不断地使物质变精神，精神变物质，推动工作步步向前。这是他从自己实践中得出的结论，也是他活学活用毛主席著作的一个重要体会。
    一九六四年底，杜逢明到怀柔县山区的喇叭沟门供销店做调查，有的群众反映买卖东西不方便，远点的地方上一趟供销店，来回就是两个“满天星”：早起上路一个“满天星”，晚上回来又是一个“满天星”。
    问题怎么解决呢？一九六五年一月，杜逢明到了“背篓商店”——京郊房山县黄山店供销店。他打算在那里寻找解决问题的答案。
    杜逢明早就听下面干部说，“背篓商店”是个革命化的商店，几个月前，也曾派干部下去总结过它的经验，并且把介绍“背篓商店”经验的小册子印发了五千本。有的单位只是把小册子向职工念一念，有的单位甚至把小册子弄丢了。“背篓商店”的经验没有推广开。当时，杜逢明也只是看了“背篓商店”的书面材料，没有真正认识到这个先进典型具有的普遍指导意义，也就没有下狠心去推广它。他学习了毛主席的《实践论》，根据要知道梨子的味道就得“亲口吃一吃”的精神，现在他亲自来背篓了。
    在“背篓商店”头一次背篓，他就去最远的葫芦棚村。快到葫芦棚村的最后几里山路，走起来好象特别长，背篓也特别沉重了。杜逢明又用手支撑着他那受过伤的腰板。一行人，没有一个不累得气喘呼呼的。身上头上都冒汗，寒风吹来，眉毛上便挂起一层白霜。杜逢明亲自尝了尝这里背篓上山的滋味，心想：“背篓商店”的同志一心想着山区人民，常年背篓上山做买卖，吃大苦，耐大劳，不怕付出艰苦的劳动，这中间有多么可贵的革命精神啊！有了这种革命精神，还怕做不好工作吗？
    第二天，杜逢明同“背篓商店”负责人王砚香一道背篓去长流水村做买卖。一个小孩拿几根羊骨头来卖。杜逢明说：“等积攒多了再卖吧！”王砚香却接过话说：“小朋友，拿过来我看看。”接着，王砚香回过头来对他说：“这几根骨头值好几分钱，收了吧。群众还可以用它买点需要的东西呢。”小孩果然用这四分钱买了铅笔。杜逢明感到惭愧：自己没有王砚香想得周到，王砚香对群众多么体贴入微啊！这不就是“背篓商店”的群众观点，“背篓商店”的革命精神吗？
    杜逢明下决心要把“背篓商店”这面红旗高高举起。
    新春二月，杜逢明又带着毛主席著作到“背篓商店”，召集各区县供销社主任和一些基层供销社干部来这里开了三天会。他没有给大家准备大报告，他给大家准备的是盛满了商品的背篓。第一天，杜逢明带头背起背篓，让来开会的几十个人，分成几路跟着“背篓商店”的人上山。人们一边做买卖，一边听山区社员群众的反映，实地了解“背篓商店”的革命精神。第二天，杜逢明拿出毛主席著作，组织大家学习《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》并且请王砚香介绍“背篓商店”的情况。第三天，座谈讨论，联系实际，比先进，找差距。原来妨碍推广“背篓商店”经验的信不信、服不服的问题，这次通过实践解决了。就这样杜逢明为“背篓商店”的革命精神鸣锣开道，号召全市供销社职工都来学习“背篓商店”，走“背篓商店”的道路。
    领导者提出了号召，工作是不是就完结了呢？杜逢明想：毛主席在《党委会的工作方法》中说，工作要抓紧，“抓而不紧，等于不抓。”他把自己的想法提到市供销社党委会上讨论，党委会决定将市供销社半数以上的干部组织起来，立即下去抓紧推广“背篓商店”的经验。
    杜逢明也带头深入基层，直接了解推广“背篓商店”经验的情况和问题。他来到郊区顺义县的一个供销社，这里还没有把推广“背篓商店”经验的事提到议事日程上来。这个基层供销社的主任认为，平原地区不需要学习山区的“背篓商店”。可是，在这里蹲点的市供销社的干部，下村去做买卖，却发现平原地区的群众也非常欢迎串村购销的方式。为什么这里供销社的干部就看不到群众的要求呢？杜逢明得出结论：这个基层供销社主任缺乏学先进的革命劲头。
    市供销社下去的大批干部，从郊区各个区县和许多基层供销社汇报上来的材料，也说明推广“背篓商店”经验的关键，的确在领导干部身上。
    杜逢明于是把郊区各区县供销社的领导干部召集起来，一道学习毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》和《关于领导方法的若干问题》等文章，看毛主席是怎样说的，自己又是怎样做的。杜逢明要求供销社各级领导干部深入下去，突破一点，带动一般。
    不久，北京市委作出决定，号召全市所有商业人员向“背篓商店”学习。北京各级供销社领导干部亲自抓“点”，推广“背篓商店”经验的人越来越多，“背篓商店”的革命精神很快在北京郊区供销社发扬光大起来。
    在学习和推广“背篓商店”经验的过程中，产生了新的经验，许多单位在某些方面赶上和超过了“背篓商店”。郊区顺义县张喜庄供销社就是比较突出的一个。
    杜逢明便到张喜庄同一百多人一道睡地铺，在张喜庄供销社开了三天现场会议。他向与会的人们大讲张喜庄供销社的经验。要求人们象张喜庄供销社那样，正确解决先进同后进的矛盾：在先进中看到薄弱环节，克服薄弱环节，使先进更先进；在后进中看到积极因素，发扬积极因素，使后进变先进，不断推动工作向前发展。
    这样，学习和推广“背篓商店”经验的群众运动，又增添了新的动力。北京市郊区供销社涌现出来的“背篓商店”式的先进集体越来越多了。现在，郊区供销社系统的一千几百个单位中，已经有一百几十个先进单位。
    “拨亮一盏灯，照红一大片。”杜逢明就是这样一个善于把灯火越拨越亮的领导干部。他认为，在推广先进经验的过程中，要反对主观主义和形而上学的思想，反对官僚主义的方法，要提倡辩证唯物主义的思想，提倡深入群众、深入实际的方法。这就是领导工作上的两种思想、两种方法的斗争。用毛泽东思想挂帅呢，还是用别的什么思想挂帅？就是这个问题的实质。
    杜逢明用自己的实际行动作了响亮的回答：作为一个领导干部，无论是改造自己的思想，无论是改进领导工作，都要用毛泽东思想挂帅。用他自己的话来说，就是：千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅是头一条！
    杜逢明在活学活用毛泽东思想的前进道路上，刚迈出了新的一步。他说，要用一分为二的观点看待自己，后半辈子任重道远，还要不断革命；要革命一辈子，就要学习一辈子，改造一辈子。
