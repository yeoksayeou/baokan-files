    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th – An air force unit of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army solemnly held a victory celebration and award ceremony today in a certain location in South Central China, celebrating the victory of shooting down a U.S. imperialist military drone reconnaissance plane on the 5th, and rewarding units and personnel who performed meritorious service in the battle.
    Cheng Jun, Deputy Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and responsible persons from the local Party, government, and military attended the meeting.
    At the meeting, Long Daoquan, leader of the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force, read the commendation order issued by Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, praising the units that performed meritorious service in the battle. Amidst warm applause, Cheng Jun, Long Daoquan, and responsible persons from local Party and government organs awarded the meritorious unit representatives and meritorious personnel with award banners, certificates, and prizes.
    Cheng Jun spoke at the meeting. He said that this victory was the result of the Air Force units holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and giving prominence to politics; it was also the result of the participating personnel promoting the revolutionary spirit of "I have invincibility" and fully developing the human factor. It once again vividly proves that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power.
    Cheng Jun strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and constantly sending planes and warships to invade our country's airspace and territorial waters. He called on all commanders and fighters of the Air Force to regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction for all work, conscientiously implement the five principles of giving prominence to politics, learn from the noble qualities of comrades like Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Mai Xiande who wholeheartedly serve the people, assiduously practice superb skills and the tactics of close combat and night combat, and always maintain a high degree of vigilance. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them.
    After the responsible persons from local Party and government organs spoke at the meeting, Sun Xiaoqing, representative of the personnel who performed meritorious service in the battle, said at the meeting that in the future, they would redouble their efforts to study Chairman Mao's works, promote the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, maintain a hundredfold vigilance, strengthen combat readiness, and, together with fraternal units, resolutely eliminate all enemies who dare to invade.

    新华社广州十一日电　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天在中南某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，庆祝五日击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机的胜利，奖励作战有功部队和人员。
    中国人民解放军空军副司令员成钧和当地党、政府、军队的负责人出席了大会。
    会上，广州部队空军领导人龙道权宣读了国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪表扬作战有功部队的嘉奖令。成钧、龙道权和当地党政机关负责人在热烈的掌声中，分别把奖旗、奖状、奖品授予立功单位代表和有功人员。
    成钧在大会上讲话。他说，这次胜利是空军部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出政治的结果；也是参战人员发扬有我无敌的革命精神，充分发挥人的因素的结果。它再一次生动地证明，由毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。
    成钧强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略越南战争，并不断派飞机、军舰侵犯我国领空领海。他号召空军全体指战员，一定要把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，认真贯彻突出政治的五项原则，学习王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得等同志全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，苦练过硬技术和近战夜战的战术，时刻保持高度的警惕，如果敌人胆敢来犯，就坚决、彻底把它消灭掉。
    当地党政机关负责人在会上讲话后，作战有功人员代表孙孝庆在会上表示，今后要加倍努力学好毛主席著作，发扬不怕苦、不怕死的革命精神，百倍警惕，加强战备，和兄弟部队一道，坚决消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人。
