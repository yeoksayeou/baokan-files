    The "Hundred Flowers Blooming, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" policy proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism, is the fundamental guideline for developing our country's socialist literature and art. For more than ten years, under the guidance of this policy, China's drama work has achieved tremendous success. However, the implementation of this policy has not been without obstacles. Drama is an important tool of class struggle in the ideological field. Whenever the class struggle situation is tense, there are always some people who come forward, using this method or that method, using this theory or that theory, attempting to prevent drama from innovating in the correct direction, and instead "rejecting the new and bringing forth the old" according to their bourgeois direction. The two major reversals that appeared on the drama front between 1956 and 1957 and between 1960 and 1962 were reflections of the sharp class struggle at that time. Facts have proven that the struggle between the proletarian literary and artistic line and the bourgeois literary and artistic line, the struggle between Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and revisionist literary and artistic thought, has always been the main contradiction in literary and dramatic work.
    Comrade Tian Han is one of the leaders in the drama circles, and is responsible for the implementation of the Party's literary and artistic line in drama work. However, not only has he not shouldered this responsibility, but on the contrary, he is precisely a representative figure of the bourgeois literary and artistic line in drama. The historical drama "Xie Yaohuan," which he adapted in 1961, is a major poisonous weed against the Party and socialism. Some comrades have already written articles to criticize it. The appearance of "Xie Yaohuan" is not accidental. For more than ten years, Comrade Tian Han has published many articles and speeches to promote his bourgeois literary and artistic ideas and dramatic propositions. "Xie Yaohuan" is precisely a concentrated expression of his bourgeois ideology.
    In order to better implement the Party's literary and artistic line and make socialist drama develop more healthily, we believe that it is necessary to analyze and criticize Comrade Tian Han's dramatic propositions. It should be pointed out that many of Comrade Tian Han's articles were published in "Drama News," and this journal once disseminated his erroneous ideas. Therefore, a serious criticism of Comrade Tian Han's erroneous ideas is also a criticism and education for ourselves.
    What are the main errors in Comrade Tian Han's dramatic propositions?
    (1) Comrade Tian Han advocates indiscriminate acceptance and complete inheritance of dramatic heritage, and vigorously promotes and advocates feudal and bourgeois traditional historical dramas.
    Chairman Mao once clearly pointed out: "To clear up the process of ancient culture, to remove its feudal dross, and to absorb its democratic essence, is a necessary condition for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but it must never be indiscriminately accepted." ("On New Democracy") This principle of treating heritage must be divided into two, discarding the dross and taking the essence, should be applied to all cultural heritage clearance work, and drama heritage is no exception. However, this principle is often resisted and opposed by some people in the drama circles.
    In the early days of liberation, based on the needs of the situation and subjective strength at that time, the Party led drama workers to actively develop modern dramas in spoken drama, local operas, especially folk small operas. On the other hand, preliminary clearing and reform of traditional repertoire with a wide circulation were carried out, and great achievements were made. As the revolutionary situation moved forward, between 1956 and 1957, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, and the broad masses of workers and peasants were encouraged by this, which was reflected on the stage. Revolutionary modern dramas reflecting the new era were very active. However, this excellent revolutionary situation became a kind of pressure on the conservative forces in the drama circles. Echoing the class struggle in society, they stirred up an evil wind in the drama circles, attacking and belittling revolutionary modern dramas, and trying to maintain the dominant position of emperors, generals, and talented scholars and beautiful women on the stage. They tried their best to beautify the traditional dramas of the old era. Some said that Chinese opera was created by the people and for the people; some said that in the vast majority of traditional repertoires, the shortcomings were only individual; some said that the dramatic heritage was full of "people's nature" and had no feudal nature; and so on.
    In a chorus of praising traditional dramas, Comrade Tian Han's voice was the most prominent. During this period, he published many articles promoting his erroneous ideas. Here, we will only select a few of the most representative viewpoints to discuss.
    In 1956, Comrade Tian Han published his basic view on dramatic heritage. He said: Where do our traditional things come from? It is not as we used to say, it is "feudal art," made by feudal rulers. Feudal rulers did not create any artistic things; it was created by the people, but the feudal class took it to enjoy. The people created this thing, to despise tradition is to despise the people, to not respect tradition is to not respect the people. ①
    Starting from this point of view that fundamentally denies the existence of feudal art, on the one hand, he vigorously promoted the excavation of traditional repertoires, believing that not excavating traditional repertoires is being "lazy" ②. On the other hand, he had a serious dislike for the work of criticizing and transforming traditional repertoires. He said:
    When it comes to opera reform, some people associate it with changing everything a little bit, no matter what kind of opera, and they don't feel happy if they don't change it. We are not like this now, and there are some operas that we are not qualified to change at all. ③
    He also said: Chairman Mao taught us to weed through the old to bring forth the new, but now there is more overturning than promotion. ④ Don't separate the modern and the ancient, thinking that engaging in modern things is the direction, and historical dramas are not the direction. ⑤ (Editor's note: Comrade Tian Han has always used the terms historical drama and traditional drama interchangeably.)
    In order to belittle modern dramas and elevate historical dramas, Comrade Tian Han did not hesitate to distort the facts and made such a judgment:
    We have more than forty spoken drama troupes across the country, more than one thousand spoken drama workers, and more than eighty repertoires (Editor's note: At that time, most of the spoken drama repertoires were modern dramas), but its influence is not as great as the historical drama "Fifteen Strings of Cash." ⑥
    Therefore, Comrade Tian Han called on us to treat traditional repertoires as archaeologists treat antiquities. He said:
    We must learn from the meticulous attitude of the archaeologists at Zhoukoudian towards antiquities. When they discovered that a small tooth had fallen off a Peking Man skull, these comrades carefully sieved a pile of soil near the skull, one sieve at a time, and spent a long time to sieve out a tooth. ⑦
    Comrade Tian Han's various discussions about drama are very messy and chaotic, but from some of the viewpoints quoted above, we can clearly see Comrade Tian Han's views on traditional drama, which are:
    1. There is no feudal art. Traditional dramas are created by the people. Not respecting traditional dramas is not respecting the people. Therefore, traditional dramas should be inherited in their entirety, without reform, and we are not qualified to change them.
    2. Since liberation, the opera reform work has been very crude, and there is more overturning than promotion.
    3. Historical dramas (that is, traditional dramas) should be the "direction" as modern dramas, even more important, and have a greater impact.
    These views of Comrade Tian Han are fundamentally wrong. He said that "feudal rulers did not create any artistic things, it was created by the people." This statement seems to respect the people, but it is actually covering up feudal art, attempting to preserve the feudal dross in the dramatic heritage under the guise of "created by the people."
    Marxists believe that all wealth, including spiritual wealth, is created by the working people. This only illustrates that the working people fundamentally provide the material basis for creating spiritual wealth, and that art originates from labor. As for in class society, all literature and art belong to a certain class and serve the interests of a certain class. In feudal and capitalist societies, the exploiting classes extracted the blood and sweat of the people, created their literature and art, and often stole the art created by the people, and transformed it to consolidate their exploiting position and exploiting system. As Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "In China, only landlords have culture, and peasants have no culture. But the culture of the landlords is created by the peasants, because what creates the culture of the landlords is nothing but the blood and sweat plundered from the peasants." ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan") Chairman Mao also said: "There is literature and art for exploiters and oppressors. Literature and art are for the landlord class, and this is feudal literature and art. The literature and art of the ruling class in China's feudal era is this kind of thing. Even today, this kind of literature and art still has considerable influence in China." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") That's how it is. Taking our country's opera as an example, the feudal class not only stole and tampered with a lot of folk opera to "enjoy," but also created a large number of works promoting feudal ideas in the nearly thousand years of opera development in order to meet their political and life needs. Yuan Dynasty zaju, Ming Dynasty legends, Qing Dynasty Peking opera and local operas, there are a lot of such works. Empress Dowager Cixi also personally presided over the revision of operas. There are more than one hundred operas that were adapted according to her wishes. Doesn't Comrade Tian Han know this? Of course, in traditional opera, there are also some works with certain anti-feudal tendencies that reflect the will and aspirations of the people in a tortuous way. However, in the heritage left to us by feudal society, even the best works cannot get rid of the influence of feudal thought as the ruling ideology of the feudal era. Therefore, there is a large amount of dross in traditional opera, which is a fact that no one can deny. If according to Comrade Tian Han's statement, it will inevitably lead to the conclusion that in feudal society, the cultural arts as superstructure are not in the hands of feudal rulers, serving the feudal economic base, but are in the hands of the people, serving the people. This is very absurd.
    Covering up and praising feudal art is Comrade Tian Han's consistent thought. In the early days of liberation, in an article discussing traditional repertoire, he defended many bad operas. For example, he praised the idea of ​​cause and effect in the traditional repertoire "Pei Du Returning the Belt," saying that although this "has a distance from our new outlook on life, it can also encourage people to be kind and responsible to society." ⑧ He praised the "Fu Lu Shou" thought in Peking opera "Hundred Longevity Pictures," saying that it "is very in line with the universal requirements of mankind." ⑨ He praised Pingju opera "Ma Widow Opening a Shop," saying that this obscene repertoire "is written very emotionally." ⑩ He even openly defended the repertoire "Si Lang Visits His Mother," which sympathizes with traitors, saying that Yang YanHui "after all, still has the heart of 'missing his hometown and cherishing his homeland'," "which is more forgivable than those who act as pioneers for the enemy and attack the motherland." ? Comrade Tian Han once shouted loudly: "Don't forget the ancestors." He said: Now "the possibility of stubbornly treating dross as essence is less, but it is not uncommon to discard the essence as dross, and throw away the 'baby' and 'dirty water' together." ? On the contrary, isn't Comrade Tian Han himself selling dross as essence and poison as honey to the masses?
     Starting from the erroneous attitude toward dramatic heritage, Comrade Tian Han is bound to make a completely erroneous assessment of the dramatic work since liberation. He believes that opera reform is "more overturning than promotion," which is a completely untrue attack and slander.
    Since liberation, drama workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party, have followed Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," and have done a lot of work, which has given new life to many types of drama that were on the verge of extinction; many traditional operas that were covered up by dross have been transformed and released new brilliance; the life of the socialist era and the heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers have appeared on the stage of drama. However, Comrade Tian Han accused us of "more overturning than promotion." What does this mean?
    In Comrade Tian Han's view, traditional opera is sacred and inviolable. The people today can only worship it and cannot make any reforms. If reforms are made, that is overturning it. But, first, shouldn't feudal dross be overturned? The proletariat "in its development process must carry out the most thorough break with traditional concepts" ("The Communist Manifesto"). Not allowing us to overturn old things is an attempt to continue to enslave us with old ideas and make us prostrate ourselves before traditional concepts. This is impossible. Perhaps Comrade Tian Han will say that what he opposes is only "more overturning." However, when he made this accusation, it was precisely in the autumn of 1956, when demons and monsters appeared in large numbers on the stage. In other words, it was precisely when the "overturning" of feudal dross was far from enough. Comrade Tian Han believes that there is too much overturning, which precisely shows what Comrade Tian Han is trying to maintain. Second, where should the so-called "promotion" be directed? Is it "promoting" in the bourgeois direction advocated by Comrade Tian Han? Comrade Tian Han said that we are not even qualified to change the opera heritage. Since we are not worthy to change the traditional things, wouldn't our stage all become the world of traditional dramas in their original form? What "promotion" is there to talk about? Where can Comrade Tian Han's dramatic propositions be said to be "promoting"? Isn't it clearly trying to "demote"?
    The proletariat cherishes and values the excellent cultural heritage of the motherland most. However, our treatment of opera heritage must not be like Comrade Tian Han advocates, taking the attitude of archaeologists towards antiquities. Archaeology is to study the history of human development from antiquities. Therefore, there is no issue of criticism and reform of antiquities themselves. Inheriting the opera heritage is to make the opera serve the interests and needs of the people today. Therefore, we must use the Marxist viewpoint of dividing one into two to critically inherit it, instead of accepting everything indiscriminately and retaining everything. Most of the heritage will be eliminated with the development of the times. Some of the democratic essence should also be innovated and transformed according to the interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the socialist era to adapt to today's needs. For traditional repertoires that need to be transformed, we advocate taking a cautious and meticulous approach, and oppose being simple and crude. But first, there should be a revolutionary spirit of daring to transform the heritage. Any traditional repertoire must be inspected and transformed by the proletariat before it can be used on the stage for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Comrade Tian Han attempted to cancel our "qualification" to transform the opera heritage. This is impossible. He compared the opera reform work with archaeological work, which is essentially resisting weeding through the old to bring forth the new, advocating restorationism, and wanting to preserve the traditional opera in its original form on today's stage.
    Comrade Tian Han not only does not approve of weeding through the old to bring forth the new in traditional drama, but also believes that historical dramas (that is, traditional dramas) are more important than modern dramas, and historical dramas are also the "direction." This is a distortion and tampering of the Party's literary and artistic direction.
    What is our direction? We only have one direction, that is, literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialism. Our drama can only correctly reflect this direction by taking revolutionary modern dramas as the main body. Expressing the new era, new ideas, new masses, and new heroes will always be the most important and prominent task of drama work. Excellent historical dramas and traditional dramas are also needed, but the compilation and performance of historical dramas and traditional dramas should never be regarded as the "direction." Comrade Tian Han's proposition not only attempts to use historical dramas and traditional dramas to squeeze out revolutionary modern dramas, but also ultimately wants to squeeze out the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and replace it with the bourgeois direction.
    As everyone knows, the Chinese bourgeoisie either despises the opera heritage or plays with and destroys it, and has never done any serious sorting out and development work. Some scholars and literati of the bourgeoisie call national opera "barbaric" and "backward," and advocate complete "abolition"; bourgeois bureaucratic politicians and capitalists ruin national opera according to their needs and tastes, and according to their purpose of making money. This has caused great damage to China's national opera in the decades before liberation, and it is on the verge of destruction. However, after liberation, when the Party carried out the weeding through the old to bring forth the new reform of traditional opera, the bourgeoisie changed into "defenders" of the opera heritage. Why is this? The Chinese bourgeoisie originally had deep ties with the feudal forces. In the socialist revolution, they are bound to find allies in the feudal ideology and unite to oppose socialism. Reflected on the stage of drama, it is the merger of feudal drama and bourgeois drama, attempting to squeeze out socialist drama and dissolve the proletariat and working people. If people's minds are filled with emperors, generals, feudal morals, and religious superstitions, how can they become revolutionaries and builders with socialist consciousness? The bourgeoisie uses feudal opera as its ideological weapon against socialism. This is a means of class struggle by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a part of their capitalist restoration activities. No matter what Comrade Tian Han thinks, his restorationist dramatic propositions can only serve the capitalist restoration.
    (2) Comrade Tian Han belittles and excludes the revolutionary modern dramas of the proletariat and promotes bourgeois modern dramas.
    In 1958, on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a new atmosphere also appeared in the literary and artistic and drama circles. A large number of revolutionary modern dramas praising the three red flags and expressing the history of revolutionary struggles appeared, forming a climax of revolutionary modern dramas. An excellent situation appeared on the socialist drama front, and revolutionary drama workers all said: "It's very good!" However, those who stood on the position of the feudal class and the bourgeois class said: "It's terrible!"
    On our drama stage, is it the revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers who occupy the dominant position, or is it the emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women who occupy the dominant position? Is it enthusiastic support and vigorous promotion of revolutionary modern dramas, or is it cold belittling, nitpicking, and exclusion? This is the focus of the struggle between the proletarian literary and artistic line and the bourgeois literary and artistic line in drama.
    Under the circumstances at that time, some people who were dissatisfied with revolutionary modern dramas had not yet come out publicly to express their opposition and were still waiting for the opportunity. Comrade Tian Han could not wait to take the lead in speaking out. As early as New Year's Day in 1959, he raised objections to the great development of modern dramas in an article entitled "Seeing the Two-Legged Approach from the New Year's Performance in the Capital." He alarmingly said that if more modern dramas and fewer traditional dramas were performed on the drama stage, it would produce three major evils:
    The first is that the work of excavating and sorting out tradition will be slackened and stagnated, affecting the normal and healthy development of Chinese drama; the second is that the expressive forms of modern dramas will deviate from tradition and national characteristics, and thus deviate from the preferences of the people; third, the new generation of actors will think that there is no need to pursue skills, and will not seriously and timely learn from their predecessors. This will inevitably gradually reduce the artistic level of Chinese opera and lose its national characteristics. ? In Comrade Tian Han's view, performing a little more modern drama, creating some heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and promoting some communist ideas on the drama stage will deviate from tradition, deviate from the people, reduce artistic level, and hinder the development of drama... It is really a serious sin! How disgusted and contemptuous Comrade Tian Han is towards revolutionary modern dramas!
    Is the "crime" that Comrade Tian Han added to revolutionary modern dramas reasonable?
    Comrade Tian Han's accusation that performing more modern dramas and fewer traditional dramas will cause the dramatic art to lose its national characteristics and thus deviate from the preferences of the people is untenable. Socialist drama should of course have national characteristics. However, the nationalization of dramatic art must be subordinate to its revolutionization. National form is used to express revolutionary content. Not mentioning revolutionization but only mentioning nationalization will lead to the road of restorationism with preserving "national characteristics" as an excuse, just like Comrade Tian Han. Dramatic art should express revolutionary struggles, promote revolutionary ideas, and promote revolutionary development, and these should be realized through the national forms that are popular with the Chinese people. This is the preference of the people today. The revolutionary modern Peking opera in recent years has been enthusiastically welcomed by the majority of audiences, which is the best proof that they have not "deviated from the preferences of the people." National style and national characteristics are not solidified and unchanging things, but lively and constantly developing things. Today, national style is mainly manifested in the depiction of the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the shaping of images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, rather than relying on emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women to embody national characteristics. In fact, the large number of excellent revolutionary modern dramas that have appeared on the drama stage in recent years have both successfully expressed modern life and greatly enriched and developed their national artistic characteristics. In this way, the national characteristics of dramatic art have gained unprecedented development and gained truly "normal and healthy development." If we do it according to Comrade Tian Han's statement, not only will we not be able to make drama serve socialism, but it will inevitably hinder the development of dramatic art and lead it to decline.
    Comrade Tian Han's accusation that performing more modern dramas and fewer traditional dramas will cause young actors not to learn skills, thereby reducing artistic standards, is also a completely one-sided and metaphysical view, and it is intimidation of young actors. Comrade Tian Han only saw that performing traditional dramas requires skills, and did not see that performing modern dramas requires even more skills; he only saw that the lack of skills would make it impossible to perform well, and did not see that insufficient ideology and life experience would make it even more impossible to perform well. What do our drama workers, including young actors, need most? Obviously, it is to study Mao Zedong Thought and become familiar with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. If these two aspects of efforts are lacking, even if there are skills, it is in vain. The large-scale performance of revolutionary modern dramas has exposed the shortcomings of drama workers in terms of ideology and life experience. This has prompted them to urgently demand to study Chairman Mao's works and to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Skills can only play a correct role and be developed on the basis of solid ideology and life experience. The large-scale performance of revolutionary modern dramas not only did not cause the consequences of "reducing the artistic level of Chinese opera" as Comrade Tian Han said. On the contrary, it promoted the efforts of young actors and all drama workers involved in compiling and performing revolutionary modern dramas to achieve "three solidnesses" in ideology, life, and skills, and promoted the rapid accumulation of experience in opera's expression of modern life, thereby improving and will continue to improve "the artistic level of Chinese opera". This is beyond doubt.
    Comrade Tian Han one-sidedly emphasized national characteristics, but did not mention the spirit of the times; he one-sidedly emphasized learning from tradition and learning from predecessors, but did not mention learning from the masses and learning from life at all. He placed the key to the development and improvement of Chinese dramatic art on the excavation and sorting out of traditional repertoires, but did not mention the decisive role of revolutionary modern dramas at all. This is fundamentally opposed to the Party's drama policy. This is an attempt to transform proletarian drama according to the bourgeois face.
    However, revolutionary modern dramas are what people want and are an irresistible trend. Their appearance makes those bourgeois dramatists very uncomfortable. Therefore, they adopted the method of sarcastic remarks and pouring cold water to deal with revolutionary modern dramas. In 1959, the revolutionary modern drama movement was carried out more widely. In general, the achievements were the main ones, and the shortcomings were secondary. These shortcomings were inevitable in the development of new things. The correct attitude should be to use full enthusiasm to help the compilers and performers of these dramas overcome their shortcomings. However, some people in the drama circles tried their best to exaggerate the shortcomings and launched a large-scale attack on revolutionary modern dramas. They accused the large number of modern dramas that appeared on the stage of being "batch produced" "inferior goods," and "third-class seedlings," and put forward the slogan of eliminating "inferior goods" and "third-class seedlings." They vilified these dramas as "diagrammatic," "formalistic," "old routines," and "stereotyped"... They made harsh demands with the attitude of aristocratic masters, trying to make the new revolutionary modern dramas die in the cradle. Comrade Tian Han happened to be a representative of these people. Reading the drama reviews written by Comrade Tian Han since liberation, one will find that he has no enthusiasm for revolutionary modern dramas. He often affirms abstractly, negates concretely, picks on all kinds of faults, and pours cold water. If Comrade Tian Han's cold attitude towards modern dramas is compared with his praise for traditional dramas, how clear is his affection for the ancients over the moderns and for the emperors and generals over the workers, peasants, and soldiers!
    Lenin said: "To ridicule the weakness of the new shoots, to hold the frivolous intellectual's skeptical attitude, etc., - all this is actually a class struggle means for the bourgeoisie to oppose the proletariat, and it is to protect capitalism and oppose socialism." ("The Great Initiative") The belittling and exclusion of the newborn revolutionary modern dramas by a group of people represented by Comrade Tian Han is precisely a means of class struggle for the bourgeoisie to oppose the proletariat and oppose socialism.
    Perhaps, this is not enough to convince Comrade Tian Han, because he can say that he has also promoted modern dramas. Then, what kind of modern dramas does he promote?
    In 1956, in a speech in Shanghai, when he mentioned Peking opera expressing modern life, he highly appreciated the "improvement" of Peking opera. He said: "From the Xinhai Revolution to the time when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, we have been performing things about the local scenery of Shanghai, and many of them are not completely unsuccessful." ? In his view, everything today has already existed in the past. This not only thinks that "the present is not as good as the past," but also wants to "replace the present with the past," and wants to use the bourgeois "improved" Peking opera to replace today's socialist revolutionary modern drama.
    In 1962, in an article, Comrade Tian Han greatly praised the Cantonese opera "Romance of the Revolving Palace," a specimen of semi-colonial art before liberation, saying that this play based on American Hollywood movies is "really very bold, wearing foreign costumes, combining foreign expressions and Cantonese opera tunes so well, which is not easy." He also said that the performance of such dramas "injected some fresh air into Cantonese opera and helped us open up a way to express modern life." ?
    From this example, isn't it clear what kind of modern dramas Comrade Tian Han likes and promotes? May I ask Comrade Tian Han, what "fresh air" can such a decadent thing as "Romance of the Revolving Palace" bring us? What "road" can it open up for us? Isn't it precisely these things that have caused serious damage to Cantonese opera? Comrade Tian Han openly praised the dirty things in the garbage dump of semi-feudal and semi-colonial society as the "model" of today's revolutionary modern dramas. Is this tolerable?
    The artistic stage is a microcosm of the political stage. Which class occupies the dominant position on the political stage, which class will inevitably demand to express itself on the artistic stage and become the protagonist of the artistic stage. In the past, the laboring people who created history were distorted and vilified on the drama stage; the masters of the stage were masters, wives, young masters, and young ladies. Today, the Chinese proletariat and laboring people who have opened up a new era in history demand to reverse the history that has been reversed on the stage in the past. The drama stage takes workers, peasants, and soldiers as the protagonists and praises the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the call of the times and the demand of the people. On the other hand, the bourgeois class and feudal forces that have lost their dominant position are unwilling to withdraw from the historical stage, and of course they are unwilling to withdraw from the artistic stage. Therefore, they try their best to prevent the workers, peasants, and soldiers from becoming the protagonists of the stage, and try their best to prevent revolutionary modern dramas from occupying the stage position. Therefore, whether to promote or exclude revolutionary modern dramas, whether to promote revolutionary modern dramas or to promote bourgeois modern dramas, this is not a small problem, but a big problem of principle. It is the problem of which class occupies the stage, whether the superstructure adapts to the socialist economic base, and the problem of which class the drama serves. The seriousness of Comrade Tian Han's problem of belittling and excluding revolutionary modern dramas lies here.
    (3) Comrade Tian Han advocates bourgeois liberalization and negates the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    In 1957, when the bourgeois rightists were frantically attacking the Party, Comrade Tian Han expressed the following opinions:
   It is not necessary that only scripts with 100% proletarian thought can be "let go,"
    Some of the bourgeois ideas are tolerable to us. ?
    It turns out that Comrade Tian Han has been fighting for the sake of gaining legal status for bourgeois ideas.
    Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the Party's unwavering policy for developing science and culture. This is based on the premise of acknowledging the existence of classes and class struggle in socialist society. Bourgeois ideology is an objective existence and will definitely emerge. It is impossible to solve the problem by banning it with administrative orders. The Party's policy is to let it out and then fight against it. At any time, whether in life or on the stage, bourgeois ideology is the object of our struggle and the object of elimination. Comrade Tian Han wants us to "tolerate" bourgeois ideology, although he says it very cleverly, as long as we "tolerate" "part" of it. But, may I ask where is the boundary of this "part"? Since we can "tolerate" this "part," why can't we "tolerate" that "part"? Isn't this advocating bourgeois liberalization?
    It is common for some bourgeois ideas to appear in the works because many of our playwrights have not properly transformed their thinking. However, this is completely different from "tolerating." The responsibility of drama leadership and the responsibility of drama criticism lie in pointing out where bourgeois ideology is and helping playwrights strive to overcome it. However, Comrade Tian Han tells us to "tolerate." It must be pointed out that advocating "tolerance" between classes is a method of class struggle by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. In fact, they are demanding that the proletariat "tolerate" their attacks, but they will never tolerate the proletariat. Comrade Tian Han wants us to tolerate dramas with feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas, but he cannot tolerate revolutionary modern dramas that promote proletarian ideas. This clearly exposes which class position Comrade Tian Han is standing on and for whom he is speaking.
    The bourgeois liberalization of thought in drama creation and performance cannot but ultimately lead to the demand to abolish the direction of literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can the firewood be drawn from under the cauldron and the realization of bourgeois liberalization be fundamentally guaranteed. Comrade Tian Han's differences with us on the issue of traditional dramas and historical dramas, and his differences on the issue of revolutionary modern dramas, cannot but ultimately be manifested in the fundamental difference between implementing the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers and implementing the direction of anti-workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The soul of the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers is that literary and art workers go deep into the fiery struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the key to all work. Without this, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers is empty talk. Therefore, despite the fact that the vast majority of literary and art workers warmly support and strive to practice combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is difficult for many opponents to openly express their opposition, but they still have to find ways to make articles on this issue and play tricks. Comrade Tian Han has never openly expressed his opposition, but in the depths of his mind, in the most natural expression of his feelings, he takes a resistant attitude toward the great idea of ​​combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Comrade Tian Han rarely promotes the idea that literary and art workers must combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers in his articles and speeches. We do not require him to mention this issue in any article or any occasion. However, as a leader in the drama circles, Comrade Tian Han should not put this fundamental directional issue behind him when summarizing the historical experience of drama. For example, in his "The Path and Prospect of the Development of Chinese Spoken Drama Art," ? "Accepting the Spirit and Experience of the 'May Fourth' Movement and Creating New Socialist Drama," ? "It is Necessary to Summarize the Dramatic Experience of the Democratic Revolution Stage," ? in his speech on the development process of the Chinese drama movement at the founding meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association, ? he either does not mention the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers at all, or he describes it lightly, burying this fundamental and major issue in a large number of tedious and boring narratives, or arbitrarily distorts it according to his own views.
    Comrade Tian Han does not approve of or attach importance to going deep into the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, because he has his own views on the relationship between creation and life. The most representative of Comrade Tian Han's views on this issue is his description of himself in the "Preface" to the "Selected Works of Tian Han" published after liberation. He said:
    I was born into a poor peasant family, and I have done rice transplanting, rice harvesting, water carting, cattle herding, and cart pushing. I am not too unfamiliar with the lives of southern peasants. I have worked in big cities for a long time, and I am familiar with intellectuals and artists. I have also lived in Yangshupu in Shanghai and have been close to workers. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I had... the experience of visiting troops (Editor's note: This refers to the Kuomintang army), and I have often been close to the troops since then. Therefore, I have written about peasants, workers, soldiers, and intellectuals... Of course, I can describe what I am familiar with more clearly, and what I am not familiar with is inevitably vague. ?
    It can be seen that Comrade Tian Han considers himself to have already combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. But what does this have in common with what we say about combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers? Chairman Mao taught us: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and for a long time, go to the fiery struggle, go to the only and most extensive and richest source, observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, and all the original materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") Chairman Mao also said: "Some people, even if they are from the families of workers and peasants, have received bourgeois education before liberation, and their world outlook is basically bourgeois, they still belong to the bourgeois intellectuals. These people, if they do not remove the past set and change to a proletarian world outlook, will have different views, different positions, and different feelings from the workers and peasants, and will be incompatible with the workers and peasants, and the workers and peasants will not tell them what is in their hearts." ("Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China") Comrade Tian Han does not mention which class's education he received in the past, does not mention his world outlook, does not talk about his need to carry out ideological transformation, does not examine his shortcomings in separating from the working masses, but sells his life experience to us as the road to combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is an attempt

    田汉的戏剧主张为谁服务？
    《戏剧报》编辑部
    党中央和毛主席提出的在为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务方向下的百花齐放、推陈出新，是发展我国社会主义文艺的根本方针。十多年来，在这个方针指导下，我国的戏剧工作取得了巨大的成就。但是，贯彻执行这个方针并不是没有阻碍的。戏剧是意识形态领域中阶级斗争的重要工具，每当阶级斗争形势紧张的时刻，就总有一些人站出来，用这种方法或那种方法，用这种理论或那种理论，企图阻止戏剧向正确的方向推陈出新，而按照他们的资产阶级方向“拒新出陈”。一九五六至一九五七年之间，一九六○至一九六二年之间，戏剧战线上出现的两次大反复，正是当时尖锐的阶级斗争的反映。事实证明，无产阶级文艺路线同资产阶级文艺路线的斗争，毛泽东文艺思想同修正主义文艺思想的斗争，一直是文艺、戏剧工作中的主要矛盾。
      田汉同志是戏剧界的领导人之一，对党的文艺路线在戏剧工作中的贯彻执行负有重大责任。但是，他不但没有担负起这个责任，相反，他恰恰是资产阶级文艺路线在戏剧方面的代表人物。他在一九六一年改编的历史剧《谢瑶环》就是一棵反党反社会主义的大毒草，已经有同志写文章对它进行批判。《谢瑶环》的出现不是偶然的。十多年来，田汉同志发表了许多文章和讲话，来宣传他的资产阶级的文艺思想和戏剧主张，《谢瑶环》正是他的资产阶级思想的集中表现。
    为了更好地贯彻党的文艺路线，使社会主义戏剧更加健康地向前发展，我们认为，有必要对田汉同志的戏剧主张进行分析和批判。应当指出，田汉同志的许多文章是在《戏剧报》发表的，本刊曾经传播他的错误思想。因此，对田汉同志错误思想的严肃批判，同时也是对我们自己的批评和教育。
    田汉同志的戏剧主张的主要错误表现在哪些问题上呢？
    （一）田汉同志对戏剧遗产主张无批判地兼收并蓄，全盘继承；竭力鼓吹和提倡 封建的和资产阶级的传统剧历史剧
    毛主席曾经明确指出：“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。”（《新民主主义论》）这个对待遗产必须一分为二、去其糟粕、取其精华的原则应当应用到一切文化遗产的清理工作上，对戏剧遗产也不例外。但是，这个原则在戏剧界却经常受到一些人的抵制和反对。
    解放初期，根据当时的形势需要和主观力量，党领导戏剧工作者一方面在话剧、地方戏特别是民间小戏中积极发展现代戏，另一方面，对流行较广的传统剧目进行了初步的清理和改革，取得了很大的成绩。革命形势向前发展，到了一九五六至一九五七年间，生产资料所有制的社会主义改造已经基本完成，广大工农群众为此而欢欣鼓舞，反映在舞台上，表现新的时代的革命现代戏十分活跃。但是，这种大好的革命形势却成为对戏剧界保守势力的一种压力。他们同社会上的阶级斗争相呼应，在戏剧界刮起一阵歪风，攻击和贬低革命现代戏，力图保留帝王将相、才子佳人在舞台上的统治地位。他们极力美化旧时代的传统剧。有的说，中国戏曲都是人民创造的，而且也是为人民而创造的；有的说，在绝大多数传统剧目中，缺点只是个别的；有的说，戏剧遗产充满了“人民性”，没有什么封建性；诸如此类，不一而足。
    在一片赞扬传统剧的合唱声中，田汉同志的嗓音是最突出的。他在这一时期发表了很多宣传其错误思想的文章，这里只选择几个最能代表他的根本思想的论点来谈谈。
    一九五六年，田汉同志发表了他对戏剧遗产的基本看法。他说：我们传统的东西是哪里来的呢？并不象我们过去所讲的，它是“封建艺术”，是封建统治者搞的。封建统治者并没有创造任何的艺术的东西，它是人民创造的，只是封建阶级把它拿去享受一番。创造这个东西的是人民，轻视传统就是轻视人民，不尊重传统就是不尊重人民。①
    从这种根本否认封建艺术存在的观点出发，他一方面大力鼓吹发掘传统剧目，认为不发掘传统剧目就是“懒汉”②，另一方面对于批判和改造传统剧目的工作产生了严重的反感，他说：
    提到戏改，就会有人联想到不论什么戏，拉过来都改一下子，不改就不过瘾。我们现在不是这个样子，而且有些戏我们根本没有资格去改。③
    他又说：毛主席教我们推陈出新，现在是推翻有余而推进不足。④不要把现代和古代截然分开，认为搞现代的东西才是方向，历史剧就不是方向。⑤（引者按：田汉同志一向是把历史剧和传统剧两个名称通用的。）
    为了贬低现代戏，抬高历史剧，田汉同志还不惜歪曲事实，作出了这样的论断：
    我们全国四十多个话剧团，一千多个话剧工作者，八十多个剧目（引者按：当时话剧剧目大部分是现代戏），但是它的影响不及《十五贯》这个历史剧。⑥
    因此，田汉同志号召我们要象考古学家对待古物一样对待传统剧目。他说：
    我们要学周口店那些考古学家对待古物的细致态度。当他们发现某个北京人头骨上落掉了一个小小的牙齿，这些同志把这头骨附近的一堆泥土，细心的，一筛一筛的，花了很长的时间，才把一个牙齿筛出来。⑦
    田汉同志关于戏剧的各种议论是十分芜杂而混乱的，但是从上面所引的一些论点，可以很清楚地看出田汉同志对传统戏剧的看法，这就是：
    一、不存在封建艺术，传统剧都是人民创造的，不尊重传统剧就是不尊重人民。因而对传统剧应该全盘继承，不必改革，我们也没有资格去改。
    二、解放以来戏曲改革工作是十分粗暴的，是推翻有余而推进不足。
    三、历史剧（也就是传统剧）应当同现代剧一样，都是“方向”，甚至历史剧比现代剧更重要，作用更大。
    田汉同志的这些看法是根本错误的。他说“封建统治者并没有创造任何的艺术的东西，它是人民创造的”，这种说法看起来好象很尊重人民，实际上是为封建艺术打掩护，企图在“人民创造”的外衣下保存戏剧遗产中的封建糟粕。
    马克思主义者认为，一切财富，包括精神财富，都是劳动人民创造的。这只是说明劳动人民从根本上提供了创造精神财富的物质基础，以及艺术起源于劳动这样的道理。至于在阶级社会里，一切文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，为一定的阶级利益服务的。在封建社会和资本主义社会中，剥削阶级榨取了人民的血汗，制造了他们的文学艺术，并且往往窃取人民创造的艺术，加以改造，来为巩固他们的剥削地位和剥削制度服务。正如毛主席深刻指出的：“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）毛主席又说：“为着剥削者压迫者的文艺是有的。文艺是为地主阶级的，这是封建主义的文艺。中国封建时代统治阶级的文学艺术，就是这种东西。直到今天，这种文艺在中国还有颇大的势力。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）事情就是这样。拿我国戏曲来说，封建阶级不仅窃夺和篡改了不少民间戏曲拿去“享受一番”，而且在近千年的戏曲发展过程中，封建阶级为了适应自己政治上和生活上的需要，制造了大量宣扬封建思想的作品。元代杂剧、明代传奇、清代的京剧和地方戏中，这种作品多得很。慈禧太后还亲自主持改戏，按照她的意思改编的戏就有一百多出。田汉同志难道不知道吗？当然，在传统戏曲中，也有一部分带有某种反封建倾向的、曲折地反映了人民的意志和愿望的作品。但是，在封建社会留给我们的遗产中，即使最优秀的作品，也摆脱不了作为封建时代统治思想的封建思想的影响。因此，在传统戏曲中存在着大量糟粕，这是谁也不能抹杀的事实。如果按照田汉同志的说法，势必得出这样的结论：在封建社会里，作为上层建筑的文化艺术不是掌握在封建统治者手中，为封建的经济基础服务，而是掌握在人民的手中，为人民服务。这是十分荒谬的。
    替封建艺术打掩护，说好话，这是田汉同志一贯的思想。解放初期，他在一篇议论传统剧目的文章中就曾经为很多坏戏辩护，例如，他称赞传统剧目《裴度还带》中的因果报应思想，说这“虽与我们的新人生观有距离，却也可以鼓励人家为善和对社会负责任”。⑧他称赞京剧《百寿图》中的“福禄寿”思想，说它“很合乎人类普遍的要求”。⑨他称赞评戏《马寡妇开店》，说这个淫秽的剧目“写得非常入情”。⑩他甚至公开为同情叛徒的剧目《四郎探母》辩护，说杨延辉“毕竟还有‘思家乡怀故土’之心”，“比那些替敌人作前驱向祖国进攻的要可原谅得多”。?田汉同志曾经大声疾呼：“不要忘了祖宗”。他说：现在“硬把糟粕当精华的可能较少了，但把精华当糟粕剔除，把‘小孩’和‘脏水’一起倒掉的不是没有。”?正相反，田汉同志自己不就是把糟粕当精华，把毒药说成是蜜糖来向群众贩卖吗？
     田汉同志从对戏剧遗产的错误态度出发，必然要对解放以来的戏剧工作作出完全错误的估价。他认为戏曲改革是“推翻有余而推进不足”，这完全是不符事实的攻击和诽谤。
    解放以来，全国戏剧工作者，在党的领导下，遵循毛主席百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，做了不少工作，使得许多本来濒于灭亡的剧种获得了新的生命；使得许多被糟粕掩盖的传统戏  曲，经过改造，放出了新的光采；社会主义时代的生活和工农兵英雄人物登上了戏剧舞台。而田汉同志却指责我们“推翻有余而推进不足”，这是什么意思呢？
    在田汉同志看来，传统戏曲是神圣不可侵犯的，今天的人民只能向它膜拜，不能作任何改革，如果改革，那就是推翻它了。但是，第一，难道封建糟粕也不应当推翻吗？无产阶级“在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂”（《共产党宣言》）。不许我们推翻陈旧的东西，就是企图以旧的思想继续奴役我们，要我们匍匐拜倒在传统观念之前。这是不可能的。也许田汉同志会说，他反对的只是“推翻有余”。但是，当他提出这个指责的时候，正是一九五六年的秋天，牛鬼蛇神在舞台上大批出笼的时候，也就是说，正是对封建糟粕“推翻”得非常不够的时候。田汉同志却认为推翻得太多了，这正好说明田汉同志竭力要加以维护的究竟是些什么东西。第二，所谓“推进”，究竟向哪里“推进”呢？向着田汉同志所主张的资产阶级方向“推进”吗？田汉同志说对戏曲遗产我们连改的资格都没有，既然传统的东西我们不配去改，那末，我们的舞台岂不全部成为原封不动的传统剧的天下，还有什么“推进”之可言呢？田汉同志的戏剧主张哪里说得上什么“推进”，不是明明在竭力“促退”吗？
    无产阶级是最爱护和重视祖国的优秀文化遗产的。但是，我们对待戏曲遗产，决不能象田汉同志所主张的采取考古学家对待古物的态度。考古是从古物研究人类发展的历史，因而对古物本身不存在批判和改革的问题。继承戏曲遗产，是要使戏曲为今天人民的利益和需要服务，因此，我们必须运用马克思主义的一分为二的观点批判地继承它而不是兼收并蓄，全盘保留。遗产的大部分是要随着时代的发展而被淘汰的，一部分民主性的精华也要按照社会主义时代工农兵的利益加以革新和改造，使其适应今天的需要。对于需要改造的传统剧目，我们主张采取慎重细致的做法，反对简单粗暴，但是首先应该有对遗产敢于改造的革命气概。任何传统剧目都必须经过无产阶级的检查和改造，才能在舞台上为工农兵所用。田汉同志企图取消我们改造戏曲遗产的“资格”，这是办不到的。他把戏曲改革工作去同考古工作作类比，实质上是抵制推陈出新，提倡复古主义，是要把传统戏曲原封不动地保存在今天的舞台上。
    田汉同志不但不赞成对传统剧的推陈出新，而且认为历史剧（也就是传统剧）比现代剧更重要，历史剧也是“方向”。这是对党的文艺方向的歪曲和篡改。
    什么是我们的方向？我们的方向只有一个，这就是文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务。我们的戏剧只有以革命现代戏为主体才能正确体现这个方向。表现新的时代，新的思想，新的群众，新的英雄人物，永远是戏剧工作最重要、最突出的任务。优秀的历史剧和传统剧也是需要的，但是，决不应当把历史剧传统剧的编演当作“方向”。田汉同志的这种主张不仅是企图用历史剧传统剧来排挤掉革命现代戏，而且最终是要排挤掉工农兵方向，代之以资产阶级方向。
    大家知道，我国资产阶级对戏曲遗产不是加以鄙弃，就是加以玩弄和破坏，从来没有做过什么认真的整理和发扬的工作。资产阶级的一些学者文人把民族戏曲说成是“野蛮的”、“落后的”，主张根本“废除”；资产阶级的官僚政客和资本家们则按照他们的需要和口味，按照他们赚钱的目的来糟踏民族戏曲。这就使得我国民族戏曲在解放前的几十年内受到极大的摧残，濒于毁灭的边缘。可是，到了解放以后，当党对传统戏曲进行推陈出新的改革的时候，资产阶级却一变而为戏曲遗产的
  “保卫者”了。这是为什么呢？中国资产阶级本来同封建势力有很深的联系，到了社会主义革命时期，他们就必然要到封建的意识形态中去寻找同盟军，联合起来反对社会主义。表现在戏剧舞台上，就是封建的戏剧和资产阶级的戏剧合流，企图排挤社会主义戏剧，溶化无产阶级和劳动人民。如果人们脑子里装满了帝王将相、封建道德、宗教迷信，那末怎么能够成为有社会主义觉悟的革命者和建设者呢？资产阶级借用封建戏曲来作为自己反对社会主义的思想武器，这正是在无产阶级专政的条件下，资产阶级向无产阶级进行阶级斗争的一种手段，正是他们的资本主义复辟活动的一部分。不管田汉同志怎么想，他的复古主义的戏剧主张，只能为资本主义复辟效劳。
    （二）田汉同志贬低和排斥无产阶级的革命现代戏，提倡资产阶级现代戏
    一九五八年，在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产的大跃进，文艺、戏剧界也出现了一片新气象，歌颂三面红旗和表现革命斗争历史的革命现代戏大量出现，形成了革命现代戏的高潮。社会主义戏剧战线上出现了大好形势，革命的戏剧工作者都说：“好得很！”可是，那些站在封建阶级和资产阶级立场上的人却说：“糟得很！”
    在我们的戏剧舞台上，是革命的工农兵占统治地位呢，还是由帝王将相、才子佳人占统治地位？对革命现代戏是热情扶植，大力提倡呢，还是冷淡贬低，挑剔排斥？这是无产阶级文艺路线同资产阶级文艺路线在戏剧方面斗争的焦点。
    在当时形势下，一些对革命现代戏心怀不满的人还没有公开站出来表示反对，还要等待时机；田汉同志却迫不及待地带头出来讲话了。就在一九五九年的新年，他在一篇题为《从首都新年演出看两条腿走路》的文章中，对现代戏的大发展提出了反对的意见。他危言耸听地说，如果戏剧舞台上多演现代戏少演传统戏，就会产生三大恶果：
    第一使传统发掘整理工作因而松懈停顿，影响中国剧艺的正常的健康的发展；第二使现代剧的表现形式脱离传统和民族特点，因而脱离人民的好尚；三，新一代演员以为不需要追求技术，不认真地及时地跟前辈学习，这样必然会逐渐降低中国戏曲艺术水准，失去它的民族特点。?在田汉同志看来，戏剧舞台上多演一点现代戏，多创造一些工农兵英雄形象，多宣传一些共产主义思想，就要脱离传统，脱离人民，降低艺术水准，阻碍戏剧的发展……真是罪孽深重！田汉同志对于革命现代戏，是何等反感和蔑视啊！
    田汉同志给革命现代戏所加的“罪状”，究竟有没有道理呢？
    田汉同志指责说多演现代戏少演传统戏会使戏剧艺术失去民族特点，从而脱离人民的好尚，这个指责根本不能成立。社会主义的戏剧当然应该具有民族特色。但戏剧艺术的民族化必须服从于它的革命化。民族形式是用来表现革命的内容的。不提革命化单提民族化，就会象田汉同志那样以保存“民族特点”为借口，走上复古主义的道路。戏剧艺术应当表现革命斗争，宣传革命思想，促进革命发展，而这些又应当通过中国人民所喜闻乐见的民族形式来实现：这就是今天人民的好尚。近年来革命的现代京剧，受到广大观众的热烈欢迎，就是最好的证明，它们并没有“因而脱离人民的好尚”。民族风格和民族特点都不是凝固的、一成不变的东西，而是生动的、不断发展的东西。今天，民族风格主要表现在对于工农兵生活的描绘和工农兵形象的塑造上面，而不是依靠帝王将相、才子佳人来体现民族特点。事实上，近年来戏剧舞台上出现的大批优秀革命现代戏，都是既成功地表现了现代生活，又大大地丰富和发展了自己的民族艺术特色。这样，戏剧艺术的民族特点才获得了前所未有的发扬光大，获得了真正“正常的健康的发展”。如果按照田汉同志的说法去做，不但不能使戏剧为社会主义服务，而且必然会阻碍戏剧艺术的发展，使它走向衰亡。
    田汉同志指责说多演现代戏少演传统戏会使青年演员不学技术，从而降低艺术水准，这也完全是片面的、形而上学的观点，是对青年演员的恫吓。田汉同志只看到演传统戏需要技术，没有看到演现代戏更需要技术；只看到缺少技术演不好戏，没有看到思想、生活不过硬更演不好戏。我们的戏剧工作者，包括青年演员，最需要的是什么？显然是学习毛泽东思想，熟悉工农兵生活。如果缺少这两方面的努力，即使有了技巧也是枉然。大演革命现代戏，使戏剧工作者在思想和生活上不过硬的缺点暴露了出来，这就促使他们迫切地要求学习毛主席著作，迫切地要求深入工农兵群众。技巧只有在思想、生活过硬的基础上才能正确地发挥作用并得到发展。大演革命现代戏不仅没有象田汉同志说的造成了“降低中国戏曲艺术水准”的后果，相反，它促进了青年演员和所有参与编演革命现代戏的戏剧工作者在思想、生活、技巧方面努力作到“三过硬”，促使戏曲表现现代生活的经验迅速地积累起来，从而提高了并且将不断提高“中国戏曲艺术水准”，这是无可置疑的。
    田汉同志片面强调民族特点，却只字不提时代精神；片面强调向传统学习，向前辈学习，却完全不提向群众学习，向生活学习；他把中国戏剧艺术的发展和提高的关键放在对传统剧目的发掘整理上，却完全不提革命现代戏的决定性作用。这同党的戏剧方针是根本对立的，这是力图按照资产阶级的面貌来改造无产阶级戏剧。
    但是，革命现代戏是人心所向，大势所趋，它们的出现是阻挡不了的，这就使得那些资产阶级戏剧家很不舒服。于是，他们又采取了冷嘲热讽，大泼冷水的办法，来对付革命现代戏。一九五九年，革命现代戏运动开展得更广泛了。总的说，成绩是主要的，缺点是第二位的。这种缺点是新生事物在发展过程中难以避免的，正确的态度应当是用满腔热情去帮助这些戏的编演者们克服缺点，可是，戏剧界的一些人却竭力夸大缺点，向革命现代戏大肆攻击。他们指责舞台上出现的大批现代剧目是“成批生产”出来的“次货”，是“三类苗”，提出消灭“次货”、消灭“三类苗”的口号。他们丑化这些戏是“图解式的”、“形式主义的”、“旧套”、“脸谱化”……他们用贵族老爷的态度，提出苛刻要求，企图使新生的革命现代戏夭折在摇篮中。田汉同志恰恰又是这些人的代表。读一读田汉同志解放以来所写的剧评，就会发现，他对革命现代戏是没有热情的，经常是抽象地肯定，具体地否定，百般挑剔，大浇冷水。如果把田汉同志对现代戏的这种冷漠态度，同他对传统剧的赞颂备至对照起来看，他那种不爱今人爱古人、不爱工农兵而爱帝王将相的感情是何等鲜明啊！
    列宁说过：“讥笑新的幼芽软弱，抱着轻浮的知识分子的怀疑态度等等，——这一切实际上是资产阶级反对无产阶级的阶级斗争手段，是保护资本主义而反对社会主义。”（《伟大的创举》）以田汉同志为代表的一批人对于新生的革命现代戏的贬低和排斥，正是资产阶级反对无产阶级、反对社会主义的一种阶级斗争手段。
    也许，这样说不足以使田汉同志心服，因为他可以说他也曾经提倡过现代戏。那么，他提倡的又是些什么样的现代戏呢？
    一九五六年，他在上海的一次讲话中提到京剧表现现代生活时，对于“改良”京戏十分称赏，他说：“从辛亥革命一直到袁世凯称帝的时候，我们一直演的是上海本地风光的东西，有许多并不是完全失败的东西”。?在他看来，今天的一切，都是过去已经有过的。这不仅认为“今不如昔”，而且是想“以昔代今”，是要把资产阶级的“改良”京剧来代替今天社会主义的革命现代戏。
    一九六二年，田汉同志在一篇文章中，对解放前一出半殖民地艺术标本的粤剧《璇宫艳史》，大加吹捧，说这出根据美国好莱坞电影改编的洋才子佳人戏“真是大胆得很，穿外国服装，把外国表情和广东戏的调子结合得那样好，这很不容易”。还说什么这类戏的演出“给粤剧吹入了一些新鲜空气，帮助我们打开了一条表现现代生活的道路”。?
    从这个例子，田汉同志所喜爱和提倡的是什么样的现代戏不是很清楚了吗？请问田汉同志，象《璇宫艳史》这样腐朽不堪的东西能给我们带来什么“新鲜空气”，能为我们打开什么
  “道路”呢？难道不正是这些东西使粤剧遭到严重的破坏吗？田汉同志公然把半封建半殖民地垃圾堆里的脏东西捧出来奉为今天革命现代戏的“表率”，这难道是可以容忍的吗？
    艺术舞台是政治舞台的缩影。哪个阶级在政治舞台上占统治地位，哪个阶级就必然要求在艺术舞台上表现自己，成为艺术舞台的主角。过去，创造历史的劳动人民在戏剧舞台上是被歪曲被丑化的；舞台的主人是老爷太太、少爷小姐；今天，开辟了历史新纪元的我国无产阶级和劳动人民要求把过去舞台上被颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来。戏剧舞台以工农兵为主角，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，这是时代的呼声，这是人民的要求。另一方面，失去了统治地位的资产阶级和封建势力不愿意退出历史舞台，当然也不愿意退出艺术舞台，于是他们竭力阻止工农兵成为舞台的主角，竭力阻止革命现代戏占领舞台阵地。因此，提倡还是排斥革命现代戏，提倡革命现代戏还是提倡资产阶级现代戏，这不是一个小问题，而是一个原则性的大问题，是哪个阶级占领舞台的问题，是上层建筑是否适应社会主义的经济基础的问题，是戏剧为哪个阶级服务的问题。田汉同志贬低和排斥革命现代戏的问题的严重性，就在这里。
    （三）田汉同志提倡资产阶级自由化，否定工农兵方向
    一九五七年，正当资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，田汉同志发表了这样的意见：
   不一定只有具有百分之百无产阶级思想的剧本才可以“放”，
    资产阶级思想有部分是我们可以容忍的。?
    原来田汉同志争来争去，实质上是为资产阶级思想争取合法地位。
    百花齐放、百家争鸣是党发展科学文化的坚定不移的方针，这是以承认社会主义社会存在阶级和阶级斗争为前提的。资产阶级思想是客观存在，一定会冒出来，用行政命令去禁止，是解决不了问题的。党的政策是让它放出来，然后同它进行斗争。任何时候，不管在生活中还是在舞台上，资产阶级思想都是我们斗争的对象，消灭的对象。田汉同志却要我们“容忍”资产阶级思想，虽然他说得很巧妙，只要我们“容忍”一“部分”。但是，请问这“部分”的界限在哪里？既然能够“容忍”这一“部分”，为什么就不能“容忍”那一“部分”呢？这不是提倡资产阶级自由化是什么呢？
    由于我们许多剧作者思想没有好好改造，在作品里出现一些资产阶级思想是常有的事。然而这同“容忍”完全是两回事。戏剧领导的责任，戏剧批评的责任，正在于要指出资产阶级思想之所在，帮助剧作者努力克服。然而田汉同志却叫我们“容忍”。不能不指出，宣传阶级与阶级之间的“容忍”，正是资产阶级对无产阶级进行阶级斗争的一种手法。他们实际上是要求无产阶级对他们的进攻加以“容忍”，而他们对无产阶级却决不容忍。田汉同志要我们容忍具有封建思想和资产阶级思想的戏，可是对宣传无产阶级思想的革命现代戏，他就不能容忍。这就清清楚楚地暴露了田汉同志究竟站在什么阶级立场上，为什么人讲话。
    戏剧创作和演出上的资产阶级自由化思想，最后不能不归结到要求取消文艺的工农兵方向。因为只有这样，才能釜底抽薪，从根本上保证资产阶级自由化的实现。田汉同志同我们在传统剧历史剧问题上的分歧，在革命现代戏问题上的分歧，最后不能不表现在执行工农兵方向还是执行反工农兵方向这一根本的分歧上。
    工农兵方向的灵魂是文艺工作者深入工农兵火热的斗争生活，同工农兵相结合。这是一切工作的关键。离开了这一点，工农兵方向就是一句空话。因此，尽管在绝大多数文艺工作者热烈拥护和努力实践同工农兵相结合的情况下，许多反对者难以公开提出反对意见，但他们仍然要在这个问题上想方设法做文章，打马虎眼。田汉同志也从来没有正面表示过反对，但在他的思想深处，在他最自然的感情流露中，他对同工农兵相结合这一伟大思想是采取抵制态度的。
    田汉同志在他的文章和讲话中，很少宣传文艺工作者必须和工农兵相结合的思想。我们并不要求他在任何文章任何场合都提到这个问题，但是，田汉同志作为戏剧界的一个领导人，在总结戏剧历史经验那样的文章中，总不应当把这个方向性的根本问题置诸脑后。例如他在《中国话剧艺术发展的径路和展望》、?《接受“五四”的精神和经验，创造社会主义新戏剧》、?《要总结一下民主革命阶段的戏剧经验》?这样的文章中，在中国戏剧家协会上海分会成立大会上所做的关于中国戏剧运动发展过程的讲话?中，对工农兵方向就是或者根本不提，或者轻描淡写，把这个根本性的重大问题淹没在大量繁琐无聊的叙述中，或者按照自己的观点任意加以曲解。
    田汉同志不赞成或者不重视深入工农兵生活，是因为他有着自己对创作与生活的关系问题的看法。最能代表田汉同志对这一问题的看法的，是他在解放后出版的《田汉选集》的《前记》中对于自己的描述。他说：
    我出身贫农家庭，插秧、打稻、车水、放牛、推车子我都搞过，对南方农民生活不太陌生；我长期在大城市工作，熟悉知识分子和艺人，在上海也住过杨树浦，亲近过工人；我在对日抗战前期有……访问部队（引者按：这是指国民党军队）的经验，其后也常跟部队接近；因此，我写过农民，工人，士兵，写过知识分子，……当然对我所熟悉的我能描绘得比较有鼻子、有眼睛，我所不太熟悉的就不免影影绰绰了。?
    可以看出，田汉同志是自认为早已同工农兵结合的。但是这同我们所说的同工农兵相结合有什么共同之处呢？毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）毛主席又说：“有些人即使是出身于工人农民的家庭，但是在解放以前受的是资产阶级教育，世界观基本上是资产阶级的，他们还是属于资产阶级的知识分子。这些人，如果不把过去的一套去掉，换一个无产阶级的世界观，就和工人农民的观点不同，立场不同，感情不同，就会同工人农民格格不入，工人农民也不会把心里的话向他们讲。”（《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》）田汉同志根本不提自己过去受的是哪个阶级的教育，不提自己的世界观问题，不谈自己需要进行思想改造，不检查自己脱离工农群众的缺点，却把他的生活经历当作同工农兵结合的道路向我们兜售，这是企图用资产阶级作家的生活和创作道路来顶替毛主席指出的文艺工作者同工农兵结合的道路。
    田汉同志总是竭力美化过去的文艺工作，并且想用过去的一套来改造今天的文艺。一九五九年，他在《接受“五四”的精神和经验，创造社会主义新戏剧》一文中说：
    我们更应该坚定地贯彻五四以来文艺与群众结合的精神和成功经验。?
    一九六一年，田汉同志在《要总结一下民主革命阶段的戏剧经验》一文中，又说：
    我们应当总结一下民主革命阶段的戏剧经验，来改正我们当前的工作。?
    这是什么意思呢？什么叫做“五四以来文艺与群众结合的精神”呢？关于五四运动，毛主席早就明确指出：“这个文化运动，当时还没有可能普及到工农群众中去。它提出了‘平民文学’口号，但是当时的所谓‘平民’，实际上还只能限于城市小资产阶级和资产阶级的知识分子，即所谓市民阶级的知识分子。”（《新民主主义论》）直到延安文艺座谈会之前，文艺同群众结合的问题都没有解决，也不可能解决。而田汉同志却认为这个问题早就解决了，他自己就早已“与群众结合”了，所以他要我们“坚定地贯彻五四以来文艺与群众结合的精神和成功经验”。
    什么又是“民主革命阶段的戏剧经验”呢？这是指民主革命时期国民党统治区的戏剧工作经验。这个时期在国民党统治区的左翼戏剧工作，在无产阶级领导下，对反帝反封建的斗争起过积极的作用；但是，由于当时的戏剧工作者没有同工农兵结合，那时作品的绝大部分，包括田汉同志的作品，还充满着资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想感情。这正是需要克服的缺点，也就是当时文艺工作的主要经验教训。田汉同志却竭力夸大二十、三十年代戏剧的作用和“成功经验”，并且要以这个时期的“经验”来“改正”今天的戏剧工作，这只能意味着以资产阶级、小资产阶级的东西来改造无产阶级的东西，使今天的戏剧退回到解放以前国民党统治区的状况。一句话，就是取消毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大历史意义，取消文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的根本方向。这是绝对不能容许的。
    田汉同志既然否定党的文艺方向，就必然否定党对文艺工作的领导。田汉同志要“以昔代今”，要以他所总结的二十、三十年代的“戏剧经验”来“改正”今天的戏剧工作，实质上就是要以田汉个人的领导来代替党的领导。田汉同志在他的文章和报告中，一而再地把我们的社会主义戏剧事业描绘得一团漆黑。他说，解放以来的戏剧工作总是出现“偏差”，遭受“失败”；他说我们现在条件好，但是创作质量低；今天戏剧队伍的锻炼，戏剧事业的发展有“不健康之处”；今天我们的戏剧运动有“关门的缺点”；?今天的戏剧电影工作者“惰眠无为”，?总之各方面都是“今不如昔”。而所以如此，是由于党不懂戏剧，党是外行，因此他大声疾呼：“这样由外行来领导内行，是很危险的！”?在田汉同志看来，只有他才是“内行”，是懂得戏剧的，因此，只有他才能领导戏剧。于是，他就以戏剧工作者的“代表”自居，要来“为民请命”了。一九五六年，他周游各地，到处煽风点火，随即发表了《必须切实关心并改善艺人的生活》?和《为演员的青春请命》?两篇文章。在这两篇文章中，他歪曲事实，对新社会和党的领导大肆污蔑，鼓动戏剧工作者起来反对党的领导，脱离社会主义道路。当时文艺界资产阶级右派正在向党进攻，认为“外行不能领导内行”，反对党对文艺工作的领导，田汉同志的文章和他在各地的活动，正好同右派分子的进攻起了直接的配合作用。
                ＊　＊　＊
    综上所述，可以看出，解放以来，田汉同志对戏剧运动中一系列根本问题提出了一整套主张，这就是：对待戏剧遗产提倡无批判地全盘继承；对待革命的现代戏则极力加以贬低和排斥；拒绝同工农兵结合，否定工农兵方向，取消党对戏剧工作的领导。这套主张形成了一条同党的戏剧路线相对立的资产阶级戏剧路线。这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争在戏剧战线上的表现。
    对戏剧战线上的两条道路斗争，我们过去是嗅觉不灵，认识不清的。《戏剧报》本来应当是在戏剧战线上宣传毛泽东文艺思想、贯彻党的文艺路线的战斗阵地，但是，在一个相当长的时期内，我们却宣传了以田汉同志为代表的资产阶级戏剧主张。这是由于我们在思想上同资产阶级戏剧家有千丝万缕的联系，我们的头脑中也存在着许多资产阶级思想和封建思想。我们有负于党的委托，没有以毛泽东思想挂帅，没有突出政治。这是一个严重的教训。今天，我们不但要和田汉同志的错误思想进行严肃的斗争，而且要从他的错误中，吸取有益的教训，使坏事变为好事。这里我们提出两点体会：
    第一，永远不要忘记阶级斗争。在无产阶级专政的条件下，资产阶级有时公开向党猖狂进攻，更多的时候则是采用比较隐蔽的方式向党进攻，用逐步溶化的方法来达到取消社会主义的目的。在戏剧战线上，资产阶级就企图用帝王将相、才子佳人和各种牛鬼蛇神来溶化我们，使我们在不知不觉之中放弃社会主义戏剧阵地。面对着这些牛鬼蛇神，我们是甘心被溶化呢，还是坚决击退它们，消灭它们？对于我们的社会主义戏剧阵地，我们是坚决巩固它、发展它呢，还是让它被挤垮、被消灭？这是戏剧战线上不可调和的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，田汉同志站在资产阶级方面，为资产阶级冲锋陷阵，使无产阶级和劳动人民的戏剧事业遭受了损失。我们必须记住：戏剧战线上的阶级斗争同其他战线上的阶级斗争一样，是长期的、曲折的、复杂的，有时是很激烈的。今天，戏剧战线上一片大好形势，但我们决不能因而麻痹起来。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想红旗，永远保持高度的警惕，同各种非无产阶级思想继续展开深入的斗争。只有这样，我们的社会主义戏剧事业才能更加健康地向前发展。
    第二，必须进行世界观的彻底改造。田汉同志几十年来受到党的教育和培养，在民主革命时期他是左翼戏剧家，解放以后他一直是戏剧界的领导人之一，为什么会成为资产阶级文艺路线在戏剧方面的代表人物呢？这里有着深刻的社会根源和思想根源。田汉同志虽然是共产党员，但思想没有好好改造，从他的世界观来说，还是资产阶级知识分子。在民主革命时期，革命对象是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，他的资产阶级世界观同革命任务的矛盾还不那么突出，他可以作为革命的同路人随大流前进。到了社会主义革命时期，革命的对象在国内主要是资本主义，这时候，他的资产阶级世界观就必然要同新的时代新的环境发生尖锐的矛盾，党一再教育我们：必须进行思想改造，才能过好社会主义关。可是田汉同志不愿意听，他拒绝同工农兵相结合，拒绝进行世界观的改造，而且顽强地要按照他自己的面貌去改造世界。这样，每当风吹草动，阶级敌人向党猖狂进攻的时刻，不管他自觉还是不自觉，他就不能不露出原形，提出一套同党的文艺方针针锋相对的资产阶级戏剧主张。三十年代的左翼，其中不少人事实上是资产阶级左翼，他们如果不进步，不从革命的同路人改造成为无产阶级战士，那么，到了五十年代、六十年代，就可能变成右翼。田汉同志不就是一个怵目惊心的例子吗？今天，我们的革命事业正在突飞猛进，我们要胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为中国革命和世界革命贡献出全部的力量。这就要求我们进行世界观的改造，把马克思列宁主义学到手，把毛泽东思想学到手。我们要认真学习毛主席著作，永远同工农兵相结合，不断改造自己的思想，来一个脱胎换骨的变化。否则，我们就过不了社会主义关，就不能跟上伟大时代的步伐，就不能成为真正的革命者。我们从田汉同志的错误中吸取了深刻的教训，我们也希望田汉同志能够真正认识自己的错误，进行彻底的自我批判，站到无产阶级立场上来。我们要永远听毛主席的话，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下不断革命，奋勇前进！
