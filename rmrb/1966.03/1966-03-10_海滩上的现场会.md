    The Party Secretary of the Qingdao No. 1 Power Plant labored on the beach and discovered that some people were picking up scrap steel from the garbage dumped by the plant. The Party Committee decided to buy it and hold a live meeting on the beach...
    On the afternoon of December 1st last year, Tang Zhiting, the Party Secretary of the Qingdao No. 1 Power Plant, was collecting coal cinders by the sea. During a break, he suddenly noticed some people bending over and picking things up on the coast near the power plant. There were no clams or crabs on the shore, so what were they picking up?
    He walked over to take a look and found that people were picking up scrap iron pipe ends, waste steel balls, iron blocks, and other discarded materials from the garbage dump of the power plant. This scene shocked him greatly: waste had occurred in the plant, indicating that he had not thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's teaching on diligence and thrift. He studied the matter with several comrades from the Party Committee and believed that this was a living teaching material for educating cadres and workers on diligence and thrift. Therefore, they discussed with those who were picking up scrap materials, bought the scrap steel they had picked up at the state price, and then put it on the beach to hold a live meeting.
    The Party Branch Secretaries and workshop directors of each workshop all came. Tang Zhiting pointed to the scrap steel on the beach and said to everyone, "These three hundred and sixty-odd jin of scrap steel were picked up by seven people from the garbage we dumped in less than three hours. Let's discuss why there is so much scrap steel in the garbage. Please also give the leadership your opinions and think together about ways to prevent this." Then, he read out Chairman Mao's quotations on diligence and thrift. One branch secretary said excitedly, "This is not throwing away scrap steel; this is throwing away the glorious tradition of the Party's diligence and thrift." Some workshop directors also examined and criticized the idea of being extravagant in production and not paying attention to saving every little bit, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings.
    The next day at noon, the Party Committee held a general meeting of all factory workers and placed the three hundred and sixty-odd jin of scrap steel on the exhibition platform in the meeting place. On both sides of the exhibition platform were Chairman Mao's quotation boards. One side wrote: "It is necessary to make all cadres and all the people constantly think that our country is a socialist power, but also a poor country with a backward economy. This is a big contradiction. To make our country rich and strong, it takes decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of a policy of diligence and thrift in building the country." The other side wrote: "Saving every copper plate for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system." The Party Secretary spoke to all the workers about the significance of diligence and thrift. After the meeting, the workers were organized to see the exhibition.
    A discussion on diligence and thrift was launched throughout the factory. Some said, "Chairman Mao taught us to build the country with diligence and thrift, but we are extravagant and throw away state property at will, which is too inconsistent with Chairman Mao's teachings." Some said, "Comrade Wang Jie cherished every drop of oil, every screw, and every inch of fuse, but we throw away screws that can still be used and welding rods that are dozens of centimeters long."
    This discussion stimulated the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs, and diligence and thrift became the conscious action of all workers in the factory. Many work groups checked for waste loopholes and formulated measures to plug loopholes and practice thrift. The young people of the Running Ding Class even automatically formed a "shock team" for collecting waste materials and practicing thrift. This activity motivated the entire factory, and a mass movement to collect waste materials quickly formed within the factory. In just five days, the factory recovered nearly thirty tons of scrap steel, more than two hundred kilograms of broken copper and other non-ferrous metals, more than two hundred and sixty tons of coal ash, as well as many firewood, rubber pads, and other discarded materials. The workers said, "We not only picked up the dozens of tons of scrap steel and hundreds of tons of coal ash that were thrown away, but more importantly, we picked up the glorious tradition of diligence and thrift of our working class, and the revolutionary spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship."

    海滩上的现场会
    青岛第一发电厂党委书记在海滩上劳动，发现有人从本厂倒的垃圾里拣出了废钢铁。党委决定买下来，在海滩上开起了现场会……
    去年十二月一日下午，青岛第一发电厂党委书记唐志亭在海边收集煤渣。休息时，忽然发现一些人在电厂附近的海岸上弯着腰拾东西。海岸上既没有蛤蜊，又没有螃蟹，那是在拾什么？
    他走过去一看，原来人们是在从电厂倒的垃圾堆里拣铁管子头、废钢球、铁块等废旧物料。这个情景，使他感到非常震动：本厂出现了浪费，说明自己没有很好地贯彻毛主席勤俭节约的教导。他同党委的几位同志一起研究，认为这是向干部和职工进行勤俭节约教育的活教材。于是就同那些拣废旧物料的人商量，把他们拣的废钢铁按照国家的牌价收买下来，然后摆在海滩上开一个现场会。
    各车间的党支部书记和车间主任都来了。唐志亭指着摆在海滩上的废钢铁对大家说：“这三百六十多斤废钢铁，是七个人不到三个小时从我们倒的垃圾里拣出来的。大家来议论议论，在垃圾里为什么会有这么多废钢铁。也请大家给领导上提提意见，一起想想杜绝的办法。”接着，他又读了毛主席有关勤俭节约的语录。一位支部书记激动地说：“这不是扔的废钢铁，这是扔的党的勤俭节约的光荣传统。”有的车间主任也对照毛主席的教导，检查批判了在生产中大手大脚不注意点滴节约的思想。
    第二天中午，党委又召开了全厂职工大会，把三百六十多斤废钢铁摆在会场的展览台上。展览台的两边摆着毛主席语录牌。一边写的是：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”一边写的是：“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。”党委书记向全厂职工讲了勤俭节约的意义。会后又组织职工看了展览会。
    一场勤俭节约的讨论在全厂范围内展开了。有的说：“毛主席教导我们要勤俭建国，我们却大手大脚，把国家资财随手乱扔，这太不符合毛主席的教导了。”有的说：“王杰同志对一滴油、一个螺丝钉、一寸导火索都爱惜备至，我们却把还能用的螺丝、几十厘米长的焊条扔掉。”
    这场讨论激发了职工当家作主的责任感，勤俭节约变成了全厂职工的自觉行动。许多班组一边检查浪费漏洞，一边制订堵塞浪费厉行节约的措施。运行丁班的青年们，还自动成立了收集废旧物料的节约“突击队”。这个活动带动了全厂，很快就在厂内形成收集废旧物料的群众性活动。仅五天时间，全厂就收回了废钢铁近三十吨，碎铜和其他有色金属二百多公斤，煤灰二百六十多吨，还有许多木柴、胶皮垫子等废旧物料。职工们说：“我们不只是拣回了扔掉的几十吨废钢铁和几百吨煤灰，更重要的是拣回了我们工人阶级勤俭节约的光荣传统，拣回了艰苦创业的革命精神。” （孙焕章）
