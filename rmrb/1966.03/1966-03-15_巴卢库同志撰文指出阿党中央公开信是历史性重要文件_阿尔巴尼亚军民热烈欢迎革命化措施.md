    Comrade Baluku Writes Article Pointing Out That the Albanian Party Central Committee's Open Letter Is a Historically Important Document; Albanian Army and People Warmly Welcome Revolutionary Measures
    In the Situation Where U.S. Imperialism and Modern Revisionists Form an Anti-People Alliance, It Is Necessary to Further Promote Revolutionary Spirit, Enhance Combat Readiness, Organizational Discipline, and Revolutionary Vigilance to Smash All Enemy Conspiracies
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 14th (Electric Dispatch) – Albanian Minister of Defence Baluku published an article in *The People's Voice* on the 11th, stating that the Albanian working masses and all members of the military warmly welcome and unanimously endorse the recent Open Letter from the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour to the people of the country.
    Baluku emphasized that this letter is a new and historically significant document. It demonstrates the strength, maturity, and correctness of the Marxist-Leninist line of the Albanian Party of Labour, as well as the great and strong connection between the Party and the people.
    Baluku pointed out that the decisions regarding the realization of the Party's leadership in the troops and military organs through the Party committees at all levels, the re-establishment of political commissars in the command departments at all levels, and the abolition of the military rank system and the adoption of new uniforms, are of historical significance for our armed forces. These decisions will promote the further revolutionization of the Albanian armed forces, further enhance the Party spirit, further promote the combat traditions of the national liberation war, further strengthen the ties between our armed forces and the people, and between officers and soldiers, strengthen organization, discipline, combat effectiveness, and combat readiness, and further enhance the prestige of the officers.
    Baluku pointed out that the Albanian people have always regarded defending the socialist motherland as their most important task. In the current international situation, the U.S. imperialists are carrying out a war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, carrying out blackmail and threats against the People's Republic of China, and forming open and secret alliances with modern revisionists against the people of all countries. In this situation, in order to defend the motherland, which is geographically surrounded by enemies, it is necessary to further promote the revolutionary spirit, maximize revolutionary vigilance, and enhance combat readiness, organization, and discipline.
    He emphasized that under the present circumstances, we are required to further strengthen the army, modernize and democratize the army. It requires us to have a more revolutionary style and working method to guide the training and education of the army, and to further improve the command system. He said that for this purpose, the Party has taken these measures in the army, which are not new to us, because in our national liberation army, these measures have long existed and have achieved remarkable results.
    He pointed out that the new measures do not change the Marxist-Leninist foundation on which our army is built and developed. These changes are only changes in style and leadership methods. These changes are carried out on the basis of the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, and on the basis of the rich experience of our Party for twenty-five years, in the period of the national liberation struggle and after liberation. These changes are natural, legitimate and indispensable.
    Baluku, when talking about the glorious traditions of the national liberation struggle, emphasized that the national liberation struggle was led by commanders and political commissars without military ranks.
    Baluku said that political work should be put in the first place, which means that soldiers should understand and view any issue from a political point of view, and any action should be subordinate to politics, that is, to the highest interests of the Party.
    Baluku, when talking about the importance of political and ideological work in the army, emphasized that in war, people play a decisive role through their high awareness, decisiveness, courage, and wisdom, while weapons are an important factor in war, but if no one uses them, they are dead things. He pointed out that people play an active role, while weapons play a passive role. Soldiers constitute the decisive part of the army.
    Baluku further emphasized that these revolutionary measures will further strengthen the ties between the army and the people. It is for this reason that our people warmly welcome these measures, knowing that these measures will further test their armed forces.
    Baluku finally said that all members of the military expressed their deep gratitude to the Party for its constant and deep concern for the armed forces, and they assured the people, the Party, and the government, and our beloved leader Comrade Hoxha, that they will, as always, redouble their efforts to struggle in order to best fulfill these decisions. They will strive to further enhance the revolutionary ideology of the class, establish more revolutionary working methods, further strengthen discipline, consciousness, and revolutionary vigilance, prepare for war, strengthen the defense capabilities of our socialist motherland, and smash all conspiracies of the enemy.

    巴卢库同志撰文指出阿党中央公开信是历史性重要文件
    阿尔巴尼亚军民热烈欢迎革命化措施
    在美帝同现代修正主义者结成反人民联盟的情况下，必须进一步发扬革命精神，增强战备、组织纪律性和革命警惕性，粉碎敌人一切阴谋
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚国防部长巴卢库十一日在《人民之声报》上发表文章说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动群众和全体军人都热烈欢迎和一致赞同阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会最近致全国人民的公开信。
    巴卢库强调指出，这封信是新的、具有历史意义的重要文件。它表明了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的力量、成熟性和马克思列宁主义路线的正确性、以及党和人民的伟大和牢固的联系。
    巴卢库指出，关于通过党的各级委员会实现党在部队和军事机关的领导工作，关于在各级指挥部重新设立政治委员，关于取消军衔制和采用新军服等决定对我国武装部队具有历史性的重要意义。这些决定将促进阿尔巴尼亚武装部队的更加革命化，进一步增强党性，更加发扬民族解放战争中的战斗传统，更加增强我国武装部队同人民以及干部同战士之间的联系，加强组织性、纪律性、战斗力和战备，更加提高干部的威信。
    巴卢库指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯把保卫社会主义祖国看成是自己最重要的任务。在当前国际形势下，美帝国主义者正在进行对越南人民的侵略战争，对中华人民共和国进行讹诈和威胁，并且同现代修正主义者结成公开的和秘密的联盟，反对各国人民。在这种情况下，为了保卫在地理上被敌人包围着的祖国，必须进一步发扬革命精神，最高限度地提高革命警惕性，增强战备、组织性和纪律性。
    他强调指出，在目前情况下，要求我们进一步加强军队、使军队现代化和民主化。要求我们具有指导训练和教育军队的更为革命的作风和工作方法，使指挥系统进一步完善。他说，为了这个目的，党在军队中采取了这些措施，这些措施对我们来说不是什么新东西，因为在我们的民族解放军中，这些措施早就存在过，曾经取得了卓越的结果。
    他指出，新措施不改变关于我们军队赖以建立和发展的马克思列宁主义的基础。这些改变只是作风上和领导方法上的改变。这些改变是在马克思列宁主义的教导的基础上、在我们党二十五年来，在民族解放斗争的和解放以后的时期的丰富经验基础上进行的。这些改变是自然的、合法的和不可缺少的。
    巴卢库在谈到民族解放斗争时期的光荣传统时，强调指出，民族解放斗争是由没有军衔的指挥员和政治委员领导进行的。
    巴卢库说，应把政治工作放在第一位，这就是说军人们要从政治上去理解和看待任何问题，任何行动要服从于政治，也就是说，要服从于党的最高利益。
    巴卢库在谈到军队的政治思想工作的重要性时强调，在战争中，人通过他们的高度觉悟、果断、勇敢和智慧起着决定性的作用，而武器是战争的一个重要因素，但是没有人来使用它们，它们就是死的东西。他指出，人起主动的作用，而武器起被动的作用。士兵构成军队的决定性部分。
    巴卢库进一步强调，这些革命措施将进一步加强军队和人民的联系。就是为了这一原因，我们的人民热情地欢迎这些措施，他们知道，这些措施将使得他们的武装部队进一步经受考验。
    巴卢库最后说，全体军人表示深切感谢党对于武装部队的经常的深厚关怀，他们向人民，党和政府，向我们敬爱领袖霍查同志保证，他们将如同以往一样，加倍努力进行斗争，以便最好地履行这些决定。他们将努力进一步提高阶级的革命思想，树立更加革命的工作方法，进一步加强纪律自觉性和革命警惕性，进行战备，加强我们社会主义祖国的防御能力，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋。
