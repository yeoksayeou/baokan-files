    Only Those Who Manage the Household Know the Price of Fuel and Rice

    In Daqing, oil wells are scattered like chess pieces, drilling towers stand like forests, and oil tanks form clusters. Oil flows out with a whoosh as soon as you turn on the tap. But how do the people of Daqing treat this oil, which is more abundant than water? Seeing someone waste a teacup of oil, they turn red with anger and furrow their brows; seeing a bit of oil spilled on a steel plate, they soak it up with a clean rag, collecting it drop by drop into a jar… In the eyes of the workers of Daqing Oilfield, oil is more precious than jewels and more important than gold. They say, "Only those who manage the household know the price of fuel and rice; those who are in the oilfield love oil even more."
    However, there are also people who act differently: coal miners who waste coal; steelmakers who do not cherish steel; construction workers who do not treasure every brick and tile... They have their own philosophy, some saying, "What does this little bit count for?" Others say, "The pavilion nearest the water enjoys the moonlight first; those who live near the river eat water, those who live near the mountains burn firewood, it’s the old rule.”
    The same thing, two different ways of handling it, what is the reason? The difference lies in the former having the thought of being a "household manager," while the latter lacks the thought of being a "household manager."
    As the saying goes, "You don't know the price of fuel and rice until you manage the household." When starting a stove at home, many household managers know how to be thrifty and frugal. This "household" is a small "household." The "household management" of the people of Daqing is different from this kind of "household management." They consciously act as masters of the country, "managing" the country's "household," "managing" the "household" of socialist construction. Therefore, a drop of oil, a piece of coal, an ounce of steel, these "fuel and rice" of the country, in their eyes, will be so precious!
    The reason why the people of Daqing can have this kind of "household management" thinking is because Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in their hearts.

    当家人更知柴米贵
    北京无线电二厂  刘宗明
    在大庆，油井棋布，钻塔林立，油罐成群。油，打开龙头就哗哗往外流。可是，大庆人是怎样对待这比水还多的油呢？看到有人浪费一茶缸油，他们气得脸色通红，双眉紧拧；看到一点油撒在钢板上，他们用干净抹布沾起来，一滴一滴收到缸子里……。油，在大庆油田的职工眼中，比珠宝珍贵，比金子重要。他们说：“当家人更知柴米贵，身在油田更爱油。”
    但是，也有人却是另一种作法：采煤的，乱用煤；炼钢的，不珍视钢；搞建筑的，不爱惜一砖一瓦……。他们自有一套哲学，有人说：“这点东西算啥？”有人说：“近水楼台先得月，靠河吃水，靠山烧柴，老规矩。”
    一样事情，两样处理，原因何在呢？区别就在前者有“当家人”的思想，后者缺乏“当家人”的思想。
    俗话说：“不当家不知柴米贵”。在家起炉灶，许多当家人很知道勤俭持家，精打细算。这个“家”是小“家”。大庆人的“当家”，和这种“当家”不同，他们自觉作国家的主人，“当”的是国家的“家”，“当”的是社会主义建设的“家”。所以，一滴油、一块煤、一两钢，这些国家的“柴米”，在他们眼中，就会那样珍贵！
    大庆人所以能够有这种“当家”思想，是因为毛泽东思想在他们心中当了家。
