    Australian and New Zealand Accomplice Troops
    Australia is a member of the ANZUS Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization controlled by the United States. Since U.S. imperialism has stepped up its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Australian army has become an important accomplice of the United States.
    According to the American *Newsweek* published on February 28, the Australian accomplice troops currently in South Vietnam total about 1,700, mainly the Australian First Infantry Battalion. In addition, there are some armored soldiers, artillery soldiers, engineers, signal soldiers, and personnel serving as "advisors" in the South Vietnamese puppet army, as well as some air force personnel. Many officers in this accomplice army participated in the British colonial army's suppression of the national liberation struggle of the Malayan people and are executioners who massacred the Malayan people.
    The Australian accomplice troops in South Vietnam are attached to the U.S. invading army's 173rd Airborne Brigade. Their initial main task was to guard the left wing of the four-mile "defense circle" around the Bien Hoa airbase, providing cover for the U.S. invading army. Later, they were increasingly driven by the U.S. invading army to undertake some of the most dangerous tasks, becoming scapegoats for the U.S. invading army.
    The Australian accomplice troops are known as "faceless troops." This is because the main force of this accomplice army was escorted onto the ship by military police armed with bayonets when it set sail from Sydney, Australia. United Press International reported that "strict security measures were taken for this operation. Soldiers' wives or other relatives were not allowed to approach the ship—the 'Sydney.' Soldiers armed with bayoneted rifles guarded the area, and police boats patrolled the port." After the "Sydney" set sail, a Reuters reporter accompanying the ship reported that the commander of the force instructed all personnel not to disclose their names, ranks, unit numbers, or addresses to the press. A senior officer explained the policy of this "faceless army" by saying that the purpose of doing so was to "maintain morale."
    Now, Australia has decided to increase the accomplice troops to 4,500. This is another shameful act by the Australian government, which is willing to serve the U.S. policy of aggression, and is hostile to the Vietnamese people.
    In South Vietnam, the New Zealand accomplice troops provide artillery cover for the Australian accomplice troops. The New Zealand accomplice troops are the 161st Battery of the New Zealand Artillery Regiment. This unit participated in the war of aggression against Korea. In addition to the artillery battery, New Zealand also has a 30-man combat engineer team stationed in South Vietnam. (Lè Shān)

    澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军
    澳大利亚是美国控制的美、澳、新条约组织和东南亚条约组织的成员。自从美帝国主义加紧侵越战争以来，澳大利亚军队又成为美国重要帮凶。
    据二月二十八日出版的美国《新闻周刊》报道，目前在南越的澳大利亚帮凶军共约一千七百名，以澳大利亚第一步兵营为主力，此外还有一些装甲兵、炮兵、工兵、信号兵和在南越伪军中担任“顾问”的人员以及一些空军人员。在这支帮凶军中，有许多军官参加过英国殖民军镇压马来亚人民的民族解放斗争，是屠杀马来亚人民的刽子手。
    在南越的澳大利亚帮凶军附属于美国侵略军第一七三空降旅，最初的主要任务是驻守边和空军基地周围四英里的“防御圈”的左翼，为美国侵略军打掩护，后来，他们愈来愈多地被美国侵略军驱使担负某些最危险地区的任务，成为美国侵略军的替死鬼。
    澳大利亚帮凶军被人称为“不露面的军队”。这是因为这支帮凶军的主力在澳大利亚的悉尼启程的时候，是被手持刺刀的军警押上轮船的。合众国际社报道说，“对于这次行动采取了严密的保安措施。不准士兵的妻子或其他亲属靠近这只船——‘悉尼号’。手持上了刺刀的步枪的士兵守卫着这个地区，警察汽艇则在港内巡逻”。“悉尼号”启程以后，随船的路透社记者报道说，这支部队的指挥官指示全部人员不得向报界透露姓名、级别、部队番号或住址。一名高级军官解释这种“不露面的军队”的政策时说，这样做的目的是在“保持士气”。
    现在，澳大利亚已经决定把帮凶军增至四千五百人。这是甘心为美国侵略政策效劳的澳大利亚政府敌视越南人民的又一可耻行动。
    在南越，为澳大利亚帮凶军提供炮火掩护的是新西兰帮凶军。新西兰帮凶军是新西兰炮兵团第一六一连。这支部队曾经参加过侵朝战争。除了炮兵连以外，新西兰还有一支三十人的战斗工兵队驻在南越。　　（乐山）
