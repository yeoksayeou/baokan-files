    What Comes First
    Now, I am determined to make efforts to transform my worldview. First, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, I will study and apply Chairman Mao's writings creatively with profound class feelings. In my studies, I will resolutely ensure: when dealing with the relationship between transforming the objective world and transforming the subjective world, that transforming the subjective world comes first; when dealing with the relationship between educating others and transforming oneself, that transforming oneself comes first; and when dealing with the relationship between words and deeds, that setting an example through one's own practical actions comes first.
      Secretary of the Danutu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiangsu Province  Su Jianmin

    什么为先
    现在，我决心下功夫改造世界观，首先象焦裕禄同志那样，怀着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。在学习中坚决做到：在处理改造客观世界和改造主观世界的关系时，以改造主观世界为先；在处理教育别人和改造自己的关系时，以改造自己为先；在处理言和行的关系时，以自己的实际行动进行身教为先。
      江苏丹徒县委书记  苏建民
