    This is their motivation to move forward
    Arriving at the Yutian Grain Depot, one hears and sees moving deeds everywhere. Whether it's the tidy warehouses transformed from dilapidated buildings, now impenetrable to insects, rodents, and sparrows, or the thousands of pieces of native equipment and tools made by their own hands, or the grain loss figures that are far below the local average, or the rich and diverse exhibition materials supporting agricultural production, all of this is testament, proving that they have indeed created outstanding achievements in the work of the grain depot.
    How did these achievements come about?
    Why do they "rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than spoil a single grain," and why does everyone see a single grain as weighing a thousand catties?
    Why have they steadfastly walked the path of hard work, diligence, and thrift for twelve years?
    Why are they not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, and consistently persistent in working hard, diligently, practically, and cleverly?
    After observation and interviews, it turns out that there is strong ideological and political work here, and that every employee has Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding light in their hearts.
    This is the driving force behind the progress of the Yutian Grain Depot. Learning from the Yutian Grain Depot should also start here.
    The most authoritative call
    One morning in 1962, Yang Nanping, a storekeeper who had recently arrived at the grain depot, finished cleaning the freight yard and casually dumped the dirty soil into the pigsty. Zhang Ru, the director of the grain depot who was sweeping nearby, noticed that there were a few grains of corn that had not been picked out. Without saying a word, he jumped into the pigsty, used his hands to dig through the dirty soil, picked out the few kernels of corn, wiped them off, and put them in his pocket. Seeing this scene, Yang Nanping's face turned red, and he said shamefully, "I was careless and didn't notice that there were still grains in the soil." Zhang Ru comforted him, "It's not your fault. You haven't been at the grain depot for long, and you don't understand the atmosphere here."
    One grain of rice weighs a thousand catties. – This is the good atmosphere that the leading cadres of the grain depot have taken the lead in forming.
    In 1963, the young storekeeper Hu Zemin was responsible for Warehouse No. 5. This warehouse could store 100,000 catties of grain. At that time, there were only more than 26,000 catties of corn in the warehouse, just enough to cover the bottom, and the young man was a bit careless. On July 23rd, storekeepers from grain depots throughout the county held a joint inspection. In Warehouse No. 5, near the wall at the bottom of the warehouse, they found about five liang of corn that had already become moldy and deteriorated. Five liang of corn is an insignificant figure compared to the several million catties of grain in the entire depot. However, at the Yutian Grain Depot, this was a major accident. The workers felt like they had a heavy stone weighing on their hearts.
    Zhang Ru immediately convened a meeting of all the depot's employees and took the lead in examining his own thinking of complacency and carelessness. He said, "Damaging five liang of grain may not seem like much. However, on the battlefield, our soldiers could have used these five liang of grain to hold on until the last minute and defeat the enemy…." After the meeting, he also carefully helped the storekeeper analyze the reasons for the grain deterioration and reported to the County Grain Bureau. Hu Zemin was so moved by the highly responsible spirit of the leaders that he cried a lot. That day, Hu Zemin truly understood the weight of the burden on his shoulders. Since then, he has carefully inspected the granaries under his care on time, tested them carefully on time, and never interrupted them in wind, rain, or festivals.
    The workers of the Yutian Grain Depot follow in the footsteps of the leading cadres, and the new workers follow the old workers. This kind of depot spirit of cherishing grain like life and being strict and meticulous has been passed down year after year.
    One early morning in June 1965, a newly transferred laboratory technician was cleaning the freight yard when she saw a kernel of corn on the ground. She picked it up casually and flicked it far away with a snap. The storekeeper Wu Ruihua saw it and hurried over to pick up the corn kernel and put it in his pocket. The new laboratory technician glanced at Wu Ruihua and smiled disdainfully. Afterwards, she said to Hu Zemin, "Wu Ruihua is too stingy. He picks up a kernel of corn in a hurry." Hu Zemin said very seriously, "A kernel of corn is also produced by farmers who sweat and toil. It is the wealth of the country and cannot be wasted casually." The education of the old workers and the example set by the old workers made her understand the meaning of cherishing grain. Now, whenever this laboratory technician sees fallen grain in the yard, even if it is just a grain of rice, she hurries to pick it up.
    In January of last year, a nine-person working group from the Ministry of Grain, without prior notice, went directly to this grain depot to inspect the work. As soon as the nine people entered the depot, they swept the yard. After sweeping several layers of courtyards inside and out, they only found one grain of grain. From this, it can also be seen that the slogan "Rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than spoil a single grain," put forward by this grain depot in the spirit of extreme responsibility for the country's wealth, is by no means empty talk.
    The exemplary role of leading cadres is a silent order and the most authoritative call. The former Party branch secretary Jin Ming, and the current branch secretary and grain depot director Zhang Ru, take the lead in charging into battle in various activities. When renovating the warehouses and pounding cinder floors, Jin Ming and Zhang Ru appeared in the most difficult positions. In torrential rain and snowy nights, Jin Ming and Zhang Ru took the lead in checking warehouses and looking at stockpiles. Leading cadres also insist on participating in labor and taking the lead in being diligent and thrifty…. The formation of the revolutionary depot style of the Yutian Grain Depot has been greatly influenced by the personal example of the leading cadres.
    Blocking ant nests
    In December 1960, Liu Yongquan, an administrator who had been at the grain depot for a short time, found two small bags of broken grain in the shed where furniture was stored. He thought: What's the point of storing it? Wouldn't it be better to grind it up and feed the pigs? He didn't know that these broken grains were prepared for the production team to mix with medicine when sowing seeds. Just as Liu Yongquan put on the millstone, the director of the grain depot, Zhang Ru, hurriedly rushed to the mill shed: "What are you grinding?" Liu Yongquan said: "I'll grind the two small bags of broken grain so that we can feed the pigs in our depot." Zhang Ru said: "How can this work? The pigs belong to our grain depot, and the broken grain belongs to the country. We must never dig into the corner of the country!" Liu Yongquan felt that he had done something wrong. He immediately unloaded the millstone and carried the broken grain back to its original place. At a meeting of all the depot's employees, he also took the initiative to examine his erroneous thinking of "being the first to benefit from being close to the water."
    The Party branch often pays attention to educating employees with this kind of clear distinction between public and private. They do not agree to take advantage of the country, even if it is just a little bit.
    Speaking of the guard, Xiao Duan, everyone in the grain depot says he is a good young man. However, one night in 1962, while patrolling the open-air grain piles in the yard, he reached out and took a few handfuls of peanuts from the peanut pile and ate them. After the Party branch discovered this situation, it immediately convened a meeting of all the depot's employees to discuss: What problems does taking peanuts show? Everyone discussed it very seriously. Some said: "The number of peanuts is not large, but it can measure the level of a person's ideological consciousness!" Some said: "We are not afraid of eating a few handfuls of peanuts, but we are afraid of the thought that directs oneself to take the peanuts!"
    The Party branch of the Yutian Grain Depot understands that "a thousand-mile dike is destroyed by an ant's nest." If you don't pay attention to small problems, big problems will occur. Whenever they discover a sign of a bad tendency, they promptly seize it and carry out ideological education at a high level of principle. As time goes by, people's spiritual world has undergone a leap, and the concept of the country and collectivism have taken deep root in the minds of employees.
    Forget the bitter roots, remember the sweet roots
    Every year, except for the busy season of grain entering and leaving the depot, from the gate of the Yutian Grain Depot, the sound of chopping hemp stalks is often heard. However, in April 1962, the axe for chopping hemp stalks suddenly stopped sounding.
    The story of the guards of the Yutian Grain Depot chopping hemp stalks has to be told from 1954. At that time, the employees of the Yutian Grain Depot put forward the slogan "Rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than spoil a single grain." From the Party branch secretary and the director of the grain depot to the storekeepers, accountants, and cooks, everyone became a mason. Some plastered the walls in the warehouses, and some cleared garbage in the yard. In this upsurge of labor, the guards could no longer sit still. Should they go to the site to do a great job? The responsibility of protecting the safety of the grain depot cannot be abandoned; Should they stand by? It's really not a taste. Finally, everyone came up with an idea: while standing guard at the gate, they chopped the broken sack pieces left over from repairing sacks into hemp knives, which would be used as building materials. This grain depot is responsible for the sack repair tasks of the county's grain departments, and broken sack pieces are common. From that time on, every time a new guard was changed, they would hand over their guns, axes, wooden stumps, and whetstones. The job of chopping hemp stalks has been passed down.
    Why did the axe suddenly stop sounding? Zhang Ru, the director of the grain depot, went to the gate and saw the guard, Liu Jiaqing, sitting listlessly at the guard room entrance. He asked with concern, "Lao Liu, are you feeling unwell?" "No." "Why aren't you chopping hemp stalks?" "I can't find the axe."
    Liu Jiaqing is the son of a poor peasant. He worked as a handyman and temporary worker for landlords since he was a teenager. After liberation, he turned over and participated in revolutionary work, and his life gradually improved. Slowly he forgot the bitterness of the past. When the country encountered temporary difficulties, he was frightened. That day, the axe was not lost, but he had no mind to chop hemp stalks.
    The Party branch conducted an investigation and found that this was not just Liu Jiaqing's problem. Several other people were also experiencing significant ideological fluctuations. The Party branch analyzed this situation and decided to organize the old employees who had suffered greatly in the old society to recall the bitterness of the old society and think about the sweetness of the new society, to help everyone improve their class consciousness.
    Shi Yunhan, who came from a poor peasant background, poured out his suffering in the old society at the meeting to recall the bitterness and think about the sweetness. He was born into a poor family and worked as a long-term worker for landlords and begged for food. Even in the cold winter months, he could only wear a single pair of pants. When he was sixteen years old, he was forced to go to Guandong. He drifted in the Northeast for fifteen years before returning to his old home in Yutian with two shoulders carrying a mouth. At that time, his old father was too sick and hungry to move. Shi Yunhan had no money to see a doctor for his father. He begged a sorghum dumpling from his neighbor, wanting his father to have a full meal. However, the old man was reluctant to eat it. Before he died, he left half of it for Shi Yunhan…. Speaking of his sadness, Shi Yunhan said emotionally with tears in his eyes: "The old society was a palace of hell. How could there be a way out for us working people! …Now that we have turned over, we are frightened when we encounter a little difficulty. How can we be worthy of the dead martyrs and how can we be worthy of the relatives who were tortured to death by the old society?"
    Liu Jiaqing listened to Shi Yunhan's accusations against the old society, and the tragic life of his childhood appeared before his eyes. He said to his comrades with excitement: "Without the Party, where would I, Liu Jiaqing, be? I have forgotten my roots! …As long as everyone trusts me, let's wait and see!" The next morning, the sound of axes rang out again. Several other people also aroused class feelings through recalling the bitterness and thinking about the sweetness, and took the initiative to examine their thoughts of fearing hardship and difficulties.
    In the past, there was a saying in this area's rural areas: "Making adobe bricks and building walls is like seeing the King of Hell; smashing cinder houses is like reporting a funeral to the Land God." Because smashing cinder must be done in one go in the summer while it is hot, it is indeed a difficult task. In order to reduce soil grain and save paving materials, from 1960 to 1962, this grain depot insisted on smashing cinder floors for three years. Every winter, they pushed carts to collect stove ash and cinder from various agencies, schools, and factories. In the summer, the workers took large paddles and smashed the floor under the scorching sun. With this revolutionary spirit, under the difficult living conditions caused by severe natural disasters, they worked continuously for three summers and finally repaired the 900-square-meter freight yard into a smooth cinder floor.
    The Party branch of the Yutian Grain Depot firmly grasped the key link of class struggle and often used Chairman Mao's thoughts on class and class struggle to educate employees. As soon as a new employee enters the depot, they are told what class is, what exploitation is, and what the difference is between the old and new societies. In work, study, and life, whenever problems belonging to the struggle between two ideologies and two roads are encountered, they are seized upon to carry out education, guiding employees to distinguish between right and wrong and identify the direction. Combining the ideological situation of the employees, they have repeatedly carried out "three histories" education, telling the history of revolutionary struggle, the history of family blood and tears, and the history of the grain depot's pioneering work. This has cultivated the class feelings of the employees, improved their class consciousness, and enabled the employees to maintain full revolutionary enthusiasm whether in smooth times or in difficult times.
    A furnace for transforming people
    Because the Yutian Grain Depot has strong ideological and political work, it has not only excellently completed the task of grain storage, but also, like a revolutionary furnace, has transformed the thinking of many people and initially cultivated a revolutionary team. The transformation of Xiao Chen is a moving example.
    Xiao Chen, whose name is Chen Yanbo, was transferred to the grain depot in April 1965 as a laboratory technician. Before coming to the grain depot, she worked as a mechanic at a pumping station. At that time, this rural girl who grew up "eating candy beans" had not had her thinking well transformed and was contaminated with some bad habits of being lazy and having a lax work style.
    When she heard that she was going to be transferred to the Yutian Grain Depot, she was afraid that the work at the grain depot would be tiring, and even more afraid that the work in an advanced unit would be stressful. That day, she wanted to come to the grain depot to see the situation first. As soon as she entered, she ran into a young man who was covered in soil from tossing grain. In the laboratory, she saw a young girl wearing a torn hat and a large apron around her waist, looking like a tofu seller. She thought: I would rather go home and farm than work at the grain depot. Without meeting the leaders of the grain depot, she ran back to the Water Conservancy Bureau.
    The next day, comrades from the County Water Conservancy Bureau brought Xiao Chen's luggage from the pumping station to the grain depot. She came to the grain depot again with a forced smile.
    Zhang Ru, the director of the grain depot, greeted Xiao Chen into the office as if he had met a long-lost relative. He patiently talked about the current revolutionary situation and learning from Lei Feng, and then talked about how the grain depot had worked hard to start a business and the lofty ideals of young people. Zhang Ru said: "Young people must have lofty ideals, that is, to contribute everything to the revolution and to the people. With such ideals, they are not afraid of great difficulties and dare to shoulder heavy burdens." The four-hour conversation touched Xiao Chen's heart. She thought: When I first graduated from school, I also had such ideals. But why are the thoughts I have now different from the thoughts I had then? Should I go home or engage in revolution? A fierce struggle unfolded in Xiao Chen's mind. She couldn't decide for a while, so she secretly went home on the pretext of visiting her mother to hear her opinion.
    When Xiao Chen returned home, she poured out all the words she had accumulated in her stomach, wanting to get her mother's sympathy and support. However, her mother criticized her: "People are like small trees, and they can't grow into timber if no one takes care of them. Transferring you to the grain depot to work is to let you learn well, but you don't know how to be grateful when you are in a blessed situation!" Her mother also told her about her father's tragic experience in the old society.
    Early the next morning, urged by her mother, she returned to the grain depot with a feeling of helplessness.
    Xiao Chen is back, but will she be able to continue working in this so-called "dirty and tiring" grain depot where she can't learn technology? The Party branch of the grain depot is very concerned about this issue and specially organized a "drink water and think of the source" discussion for her. One old employee after another told about the bloody history of their families in the old society at the meeting. Comrades from the Party branch told about the struggle deeds during the Anti-Japanese War and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. As Xiao Chen listened, she couldn't help but ask herself: In the past, the working people suffered the same hardships, and now they enjoy the same blessings, so why can others do the work, but she dislikes it for being dirty and tiring? Thinking of this, it seemed that those heroic and unyielding People's Liberation Army and Volunteer Army soldiers were all accusing her of being a deserter of the revolution. She was in an excited mood, her thoughts surging, and finally stood up to express to everyone: "I was wrong! I will definitely listen to the Party and work in the grain depot for the rest of my life!"
    The hard-working style in the grain depot was indeed difficult to adapt to for Xiao Chen, who was used to a scattered life. For example, in the past, Xiao Chen used thick bamboo poles as firewood, but here, whether it is a grain of grain, a small piece of broken mat, or a broom handle, people pick it up and keep it safe. The process of learning these excellent styles is also a process of ideological transformation.
    What fundamentally changed Xiao Chen's thinking was studying Chairman Mao's works.
    The Party branch and the Youth League branch helped Xiao Chen repeatedly study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." She slowly learned to examine her own thinking by comparing it with Chairman Mao's works. Her interest in learning also became higher and higher, sometimes studying until late at night. By studying Chairman Mao's works, she began to understand that a person lives for the revolution, and grain depot work is revolutionary work. At a study meeting, she systematically examined and criticized her erroneous thinking, and said with deep feeling: "I am like a furnace. Before, the fire was suppressed by bourgeois ideology; now, Chairman Mao's works have opened up the furnace!"
    Since then, Xiao Chen has been full of energy when she works, and she rushes to do dirty and heavy work. Her work style has also become much more down-to-earth. Some people say that Xiao Chen's face has turned black, but Xiao Chen said: "My face is black, but my heart is red!"

### 这就是他们前进的动力

    这就是他们前进的动力
    来到玉田粮库，耳闻目见，到处是动人的事迹。无论是由破烂房屋改造成的虫鼠麻雀无处容身的整洁的仓房，还是他们凭自己双手制造的上千件土设备、土工具，无论是那大大低于当地平均水平的粮食损耗数字，还是丰富多样的支持农业生产的展览材料，这一切都是见证，证明他们在粮库工作中确实创造了出色的成绩。
    这些成绩是怎么得来的？
    为什么他们“宁流千滴汗，不坏一粒粮”，人人把一粒粮食看得千斤重？
    为什么他们能在艰苦奋斗、勤俭创业的道路上，坚定不移地走了十二年？
    为什么他们不怕苦，不怕累，长年坚持穷干、苦干、实干、巧干？
    经过观察，访问，原来这里有强有力的思想政治工作，原来每个职工心里都有毛泽东思想作为指路明灯。
    这就是玉田粮库前进的动力。学习玉田粮库，也应当从这里学起。
    最权威的号召
    一九六二年的一天早晨，来粮库不久的保管员杨南平，清扫完了货场，顺手把脏土倒进猪圈里。正在一旁扫地的粮库主任张儒，发现里面有几粒粮食没有拣出来，二话没说就跳进猪圈，用手扒开脏土把几颗玉米粒挑出来，擦了擦装进衣袋里。杨南平看到这种情景，顿时脸上火辣辣的，惭愧地说：“我疏忽大意了，没有注意土里还有粮粒。”张儒安慰他：“这不怪你，你来粮库不久，还不了解库里的风气。”
    一粒粮食千斤重。——这是粮库领导干部带头形成的好风气。
    一九六三年，青年保管员胡泽民负责五号仓房。这座仓房能储存十万斤粮食。当时仓房里只有二万六千多斤玉米，刚刚铺满仓底，年青人有点疏忽大意。七月二十三日这一天，全县粮库保管员举行联合检查，在五号仓房靠仓底的墙根上，发现有大约五两玉米已经发霉变质。五两玉米，对全库几百万斤粮食来说，是个微不足道的数字。但是，在玉田粮库，这就是个大事故。职工们心里都象压上了块大石头。
    张儒马上召集全库职工开会，带头检讨了自己的麻痹大意思想。他说：“坏五两粮，看来不算什么。但是，在战场上，我们的战士有了这五两粮食，就能坚持到最后一分钟，把敌人打垮……。”会后，他还认真地帮助保管员分析粮食变质的原因，并向县粮食局作了汇报。胡泽民被领导上这种高度负责的精神感动得痛哭了一场。这一天，胡泽民才真正了解到自己身上的担子的分量。以后，凡是经他保管的粮仓，他都按时仔细检查，按时认真化验，刮风下雨，逢年过节，从不间断。
    玉田粮库的职工跟着领导干部的脚印走，新职工跟着老职工走。这种爱粮如命，严细认真的库风，一年年传了下来。
    一九六五年六月间的一天清早，一个新调来的化验员正在打扫货场，她看到地上有一个玉米粒，便顺手拣了起来，啪的一声，弹出老远。保管员吴瑞华看见了，赶忙跑过去把玉米粒拣起来，放在自己衣袋里。这位新化验员看了吴瑞华一眼，轻视地笑了。事后，她对胡泽民说：“吴瑞华太小气了，看到个玉米粒也赶忙拣起来。”胡泽民很严肃地说：“一颗玉米粒，也是农民一个汗珠摔八瓣生产出来的，这是国家的财富，不能随便糟踏着玩。”老职工的教育，老职工做出的榜样，使她懂得了爱惜粮食的意义。现在，这位化验员每逢在院子里见到有掉的粮食，哪怕是个谷子粒，也赶忙拣起来。
    去年一月间，粮食部的一个九人工作组，事先没有通知，就直接到这个粮库来检查工作。九个人一进库便扫院子，里里外外几层院子扫完了，只找到了一颗粮食。由此也可以看出，这个粮库本着对国家财富极端负责的精神提出的“宁流千滴汗，不坏一粒粮”，这个口号绝不是一句空话。
    领导干部的表率作用，是无声的命令，也是最权威的号召。原党支部书记靳明，现在的支部书记、粮库主任张儒，在各项活动中都领头冲锋陷阵。在改造仓房、打焦渣地坪的时候，靳明、张儒出现在最艰苦的岗位上。在倾盆大雨之中，在风雪交加之夜，靳明、张儒带头查仓看囤。领导干部们还坚持参加劳动，带头勤俭节约……。玉田粮库革命库风的形成，领导干部的身教起了重大作用。
    堵蝼蚁之穴
    一九六○年十二月间，管理员刘永泉来粮库不久，他发现在放家具的棚子里有两小口袋碎土粮。他想：存它有啥用处，把它磨一磨喂猪多好？他不知道这些碎粮食是准备供应给生产队在下种时拌药用的。刘永泉刚套上磨，粮库主任张儒便匆匆忙忙地赶到磨棚里来：“你磨的是啥？”刘永泉说：“我把两小口袋碎土粮磨磨，好喂咱库里的猪。”张儒说：“这哪能行，猪是我们粮库的，碎土粮是国家的，我们决不能挖国家的墙角！”刘永泉觉得自己把事办错了，马上卸了磨，把碎土粮又扛回原处。在一次全库职工会上，他还主动检查了自己“近水楼台先得月”的错误思想。
    党支部经常注意用这种公私分明的思想教育职工。哪怕是占国家一点便宜，也不答应。
    提起警卫员小段，粮库里都说是个好青年。可是，在一九六二年的一天深夜里，他在院里巡逻露天粮囤，路过花生囤，顺手掏出来几把花生吃了。党支部发现这一情况以后，马上召开全库职工大会，让大家讨论：拿花生吃，说明了什么问题？大家讨论得非常认真。有的说：“几把花生数量不大，可是能量出人的思想觉悟的高低！”有的说：“不怕吃几把花生，就怕支配自己去拿花生的思想！”
    玉田粮库的党支部懂得，“千里之堤，溃于蝼蚁之穴。”小问题不注意就会发生大问题。他们每当发现一点不良倾向的苗头，就及时抓住，提到原则高度进行思想教育。这样日子一长，人们的精神世界就发生了飞跃，国家观念、集体主义思想在职工头脑中深深扎下了根子。
    忘苦根　牢记甜根
    每年，除了粮食入库、出库的大忙季节，从玉田粮库的大门洞里，经常会传出一阵阵嘭嘭的剁麻刀的声音。可是，在一九六二年四月间，剁麻刀的斧头突然不响了。
    提起玉田粮库警卫人员剁麻刀的事，还得从一九五四年讲起。当时，玉田粮库职工提出“宁流千滴汗，不坏一粒粮”的口号。从党支部书记、粮库主任，一直到保管员、会计、伙房的大师傅，都当了泥瓦匠。有的在仓房里，粉刷仓壁，有的在院子里清除垃圾。在这个劳动热潮中，警卫人员再也坐不住了。到现场去大干一番吧？保卫粮库安全的责任不能放弃；袖手旁观吧？又实在不是滋味。最后，大家想了一个主意：在大门口一面站岗，一面把修补麻袋剩下来的碎麻袋片剁成麻刀，作为建筑材料。这个粮库担负着全县粮食部门的麻袋修理任务，碎麻袋片是常有的。从那时候起，每换一个新的警卫人员，他们都是一手交枪，一手交斧头、木墩和磨刀石。剁麻刀的活儿，一直传了下来。
    为什么斧头突然不响了？粮库主任张儒到门口一看，警卫员刘家庆正在警卫室门口，无精打彩地坐着。他关心地问：“老刘，身上不舒服？”“没有。”“怎么没剁麻刀啊？”“斧子找不到了。”
    刘家庆，是个贫农的儿子。他从十几岁就给地主当小工，打短工。解放以后翻了身，参加了革命工作，生活逐渐好起来，慢慢地把黄连的苦味忘掉了。在国家遇到暂时困难的时候，他被吓住了。那天，斧子并没有丢失，只是他没有心思去剁麻刀罢了。
    党支部做了一番调查，这不仅是刘家庆一个人的问题，另外还有几个人思想波动也很大。党支部分析了这种情况，决定组织在旧社会苦大仇深的老职工忆旧社会的苦，想新社会的甜，帮助大家提高阶级觉悟。
    贫农出身的史云汉，在忆苦思甜的会上倾诉了在旧社会所受的苦情。他从小家贫如洗，给地主当过长工，讨过饭。十冬腊月里，还只能穿条单裤。十六岁那一年，被迫下了关东。在东北整整漂流了十五年，又两个肩膀扛着一个嘴巴回到玉田老家。当时，老父亲连病带饿，骨瘦如柴，已经不能动了。史云汉无钱给父亲看病，从邻居讨来了一个高粱饽饽，想让父亲吃顿饱饭。可是，老人家不舍得吃。临死的时候，还给史云汉剩下半块……。史云汉说到伤心处，含着眼泪激动地说：“旧社会是阎王殿，哪有我们劳动人民的活路！……现在，我们翻了身，刚遇到一点困难，就被吓倒了，怎么对得起死去的烈士，怎么对得起被旧社会折磨死的亲人？”
    刘家庆倾听着史云汉对旧社会的控诉，小时候的悲惨生活，又一幕一幕地展现在眼前。他情绪激昂地对同志们说：“没有党，哪有我刘家庆？我忘本了！……只要大家信得过我，咱走着瞧吧！”第二天一清早，一阵阵的斧子声又响起来了。另外几个人通过忆苦思甜，也激发了阶级感情，主动检查了怕艰苦、怕困难的思想。
    过去，这一带农村中流传着这样一句话：“脱坯打墙，活见阎王；砸焦渣房，土地爷前去报丧。”由于砸焦渣必须在夏天趁热一气呵成，这确实是一件艰苦的活儿。为了减少土粮，节省铺垫器材，从一九六○年到一九六二年，这个粮库坚持砸了三年焦渣地坪。每到冬天，就推着车子到各机关、学校、工厂搜集炉灰焦渣。到了夏天，职工们就拿着大拍板，顶着毒日头砸地坪。就凭着这种革命精神，在严重自然灾害造成的艰苦生活条件下，他们连续干了三个夏天，终于把九百多平方米的货场修成了平整如镜的焦渣地面。
    玉田粮库党支部紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，经常用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的思想教育职工。新职工一进库，就讲什么是阶级，什么叫剥削，新旧社会有什么区别。在工作、学习、生活中，每逢遇到属于两种思想、两条道路斗争的问题，就抓紧教育，引导职工分清是非，辨明方向。他们结合职工的思想情况，多次进行了“三史”教育，讲革命斗争史、家庭血泪史、粮库创业史。这就培养了职工的阶级感情，提高了职工的阶级觉悟，使职工们不管在顺利的时候，还是困难的时候，都保持着充沛的革命热情。
    改造人的熔炉
    玉田粮库因为有强有力的思想政治工作，不仅出色地完成了粮食保管任务，而且象一座革命化的熔炉一样，改造了不少人的思想，初步培养起一支革命化的队伍。小陈的转变，就是一个动人的例子。
    小陈，名叫陈艳博，一九六五年四月间调到粮库来当化验员。来粮库以前，她在一个扬水站当机手。那时候，这个“吃糖豆”长大的农村姑娘，思想没有得到很好改造，身上沾染着一些好逸恶劳、作风散漫的坏习惯。
    一听说要调她到玉田粮库，她就害怕粮库活累，更怕先进单位工作紧张。那天，她想先到粮库来看看情况。一进门，就碰到个因为倒腾粮食弄得满身是土的小伙子。在化验室里，她看到一个年轻姑娘，戴着个破帽子，腰里扎着大围裙，活象一个卖豆腐脑的。她想：情愿回家种地，也不在粮库工作。没见粮库领导的面，就跑回水利局去了。
    第二天，县水利局的同志把小陈的行李从扬水站捎到粮库来了。她又硬着头皮来到粮库。
    粮库主任张儒象见了久别的亲人一样，热情地把小陈领到办公室里。他耐心地从当前的革命形势谈到学习雷锋，又从粮库怎样艰苦创业谈到青年人的远大理想。张儒说：“青年人要有远大理想，就是要为革命、为人民贡献自己的一切。有了这样的理想，天大的困难也不怕，多重的担子也敢挑。”四个小时的谈话，触动了小陈的心。她想：自己刚从学校毕业的时候，也有过这样的理想。可是，为什么现在想的和那时候想的不一样呢？到底是回家，还是干革命？小陈的脑子里展开了激烈的斗争。她一时决定不下，还是借故偷偷回了趟家，想听听妈妈的意见。
    小陈回到家里，把积了一肚子的话倒出来，想得到妈妈的同情和支持。可是，妈妈却批评了她：“人和小树一样，没人管也长不成材。调你到粮库工作，是让你学好，你偏身在福中不知福！”妈妈还对她讲了父亲在旧社会的悲惨遭遇。
    第二天大清早，在妈妈催促下，她又带着无可奈何的心情回到粮库。
    小陈回来了，可是，能不能在这所谓“又脏又累，又学不到技术”的粮库里干下去呢？粮库党支部非常关心这个问题，特意为她组织了一次“饮水思源”座谈会。一个又一个的老职工，在会上讲述了自己家庭在旧社会的血泪史。党支部的同志讲述了在抗日战争时期和在抗美援朝战争期间的斗争事迹。小陈听着，听着，不禁问自己：过去，劳动人民受的一样的苦，现在又享的一样的福，为什么别人能干的活，自己就嫌脏怕累呢？想到这里，仿佛那些英勇不屈的解放军、志愿军战士，都在指责她当了革命的逃兵。她心情激动，思潮起伏，最后站起来向大家表示：“我错了！我一定好好听党的话，在粮库干一辈子！”
    粮库里艰苦奋斗的作风，对于过惯了散漫生活的小陈来说，开始确实不能适应。比如，过去小陈用一掐粗的竹竿当柴烧，可是在这里，不管是一粒粮，还是一小片破席，一个扫帚把子，人们都拣起来，保存好。学习这些优良作风的过程，也是一个思想改造的过程。
    促使小陈的思想发生根本变化的，还是学习毛主席著作。
    党支部和团支部帮助小陈反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章。她慢慢学会了对照毛主席著作检查自己的思想。学习的兴趣也越来越高，有时候一直学到深夜。通过学习毛主席著作，她开始懂得了一个人活着是为了革命，粮库工作就是革命工作。在一次学习会上，她比较系统地检查批判了自己的错误思想，并且深有所感地说：“我好比一个火炉，以前被资产阶级思想把火压住了；现在，毛主席著作把火炉捅开了！”
    从此，小陈工作起来满身是劲，不管是脏活重活，都抢着干。作风也踏实多了。有人说小陈的脸晒黑了，小陈却说：“我脸黑了，可心红了！”
