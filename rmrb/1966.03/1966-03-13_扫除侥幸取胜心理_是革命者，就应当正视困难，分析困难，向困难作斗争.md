    Eliminate the Mentality of Winning by Luck
    A Revolutionary Should Face Difficulties, Analyze Difficulties, and Struggle Against Difficulties
    In the past, many things could have been done successfully and well, but they were not; many things could have been done faster, but they were not. When examining the reasons, we always emphasized the many difficulties and poor conditions. After studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I truly found the reason: Poor conditions and many difficulties are also facts, but these are not the fundamental reasons. The fundamental reason is that my own thinking has not been truly revolutionized.
    In the past, if anyone said that I had not established a world view of wholeheartedly serving the people, I would not have agreed. Wasn't I constantly studying articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune"? Wasn't I constantly saying that I should serve the people well? Wasn't I also constantly thinking about how to better complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party and the people? Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel that the main problem is not whether I studied or not, said or not, thought or not, but mainly whether I did it or not, whether I did it resolutely and thoroughly or not. Compared with neighboring counties, Guidong County had many gaps in terms of water conservancy, fertilizers, seeds, and cultivation methods. We also wanted to mobilize the masses to work hard and change the low-yield situation. We also conducted some experiments in the spirit of "major changes lead to major production increases, minor changes lead to minor production increases," which did play a significant role. However, because I did not have thoroughly revolutionary thinking and courage, some things only started or reached the middle, and then wavered and stopped because of difficulties, only half-revolutionized.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "If we have correct theory, but only talk about it for a while, put it on the shelf, and do not put it into practice, then even the best theory is meaningless." I used to commit the mistake of "talking about it for a while and putting it on the shelf."
    To do any work well, you will encounter difficulties. It is impossible not to encounter difficulties in building a county into a new socialist countryside. Chairman Mao said: "The psychology of all cadres who rely on accidental convenience and fluke wins without their own hard work, bloodshed and sweat must be swept away." We are Marxists and proletarian revolutionaries, and we should not have the mentality of winning by luck. On the contrary, we should face difficulties squarely, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties. When we learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we should be like him, according to Chairman Mao's teaching that "the more difficult the place, the more we must go," go to the most difficult places to work and struggle, and regard taking on heavy burdens as our responsibility and struggling against difficulties as our glory.

    扫除侥幸取胜心理
    是革命者，就应当正视困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争
    过去有许多事情，本来可以办成功、办好的，但是没有办成功、没有办好，本来可以办得快一些的，结果没有办快。检查原因，总是强调困难多，条件差。学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹后，我真正找到了原因：条件差、困难多，也是事实，但这不是根本原因。根本原因是自己的思想没有真正革命化。
    过去，谁要说我没有树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观，我是不会同意的。难道我不是经常在学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章吗？难道我不是经常在说要好好为人民服务吗？难道我不是经常也在想如何把党、把人民交给自己的任务完成得更好一些吗？同焦裕禄同志一比，觉得问题主要不是在于学了没学，说了没说，想了没想，主要在于做了没做，做得坚决不坚决、彻底不彻底。比起兄弟县来，桂东县在水利、肥料、种子、耕作方法等方面，存在着不少差距，我们也想发动群众大干一场，改变低产面貌，还本着“大改大增产，小改小增产”的精神搞过一些试验，确也起了不小作用。但是，由于自己没有彻底革命的思想和胆略，因此，有些东西只开了一个头或搞到中途，就因为碰到困难而动摇了，停止了，革了半截子命。
    毛主席教导我们：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”我以前就犯了“空谈一阵，束之高阁”的毛病。
    做任何一项工作，要把它做好，都会遇到困难的。要把一个县建设成为社会主义新农村，不可能不碰到困难。毛主席说过：“干部中一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理，必须扫除干净。”我们是马克思主义者，是无产阶级革命家，不应当有侥幸取胜的心理。相反，我们应当正视困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。我们向焦裕禄同志学习，就应当象他那样，按照毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”的教导，到最困难的地方去工作，去斗争，把挑重担子看作是我们的责任，把向困难作斗争看作是我们的光荣。  湖南桂东县委副书记  徐作生
