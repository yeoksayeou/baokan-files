    Industrial High-Speed Sewing Machine Made in Shanghai
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai – The Shanghai Garment Factory is producing a small batch of industrial high-speed sewing machines.
    This sewing machine is suitable for use in industries such as clothing and knitting. It operates at 4,000 revolutions per minute and can sew both thick and thin fabrics, with very uniform stitches.
    When used to sew garments with short seams, the efficiency is about 30% higher than that of ordinary industrial sewing machines; when used to sew garments with long seams, the efficiency is about 50% higher.
    This high-speed sewing machine also has many advantages: the machine head is flat and upright, so the light is not affected during operation; it has a reverse stitching device for easy use; it rotates with bevel gears, which is light and flexible, noiseless, and does not break the thread; one oiling can last for about a month, saving a lot of oil.
    In the process of trial-manufacturing this sewing machine, the workers of the Shanghai Garment Factory demonstrated both a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and a strict scientific attitude. They spent more than 180 days and conducted more than 260 repeated tests before finally achieving success.

    工业用高速缝纫机在上海制成
    新华社上海电　上海服装厂正在小批生产一种工业用高速缝纫机。
    这种缝纫机适合服装和针织等行业使用，每分钟四千转，厚薄布料都能缝制，上下针脚非常均匀。
    用这种缝纫机缝制短缝道服装，效率比一般工业缝纫机高百分之三十左右；缝制长缝道的服装，效率高百分之五十左右。
    这种高速缝纫机还有很多优点：机头平立，操作时光线不受影响；有倒回针装置，使用方便；用伞齿轮转动，轻巧灵活，没有响声，不断线；加油一次，可用一月左右，用油很省。
    上海服装厂职工在试制这种缝纫机的过程中，既发挥了高度的革命干劲，又坚持了严格的科学态度。他们花费了一百八十多天的时间，并且进行了二百六十多次的反复试验，最后才获得成功。
