    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency in London on March 1st, British Prime Minister Wilson announced at the Prime Minister's residence on the evening of February 28th that Britain would hold a new general election on March 31st.

    Wilson's statement said that the current Parliament would be dissolved on March 10th, and the new Parliament would convene on April 18th.

    Wilson's statement did not explain the reasons why the Labour government, which had been in power for only sixteen months, announced the early election. However, the British Prime Minister made it very clear at a press conference held in Birmingham ten days ago: Whether or not to hold a new general election depends on whether a government is capable of "continuing to do its job" and "being able to clearly represent Britain when dealing with foreign politicians."

    According to the current British system, the British Parliament is re-elected every five years, but the ruling party can, during its term, dissolve Parliament early and hold a general election based on changes in the political situation and the ruling party's own interests.

    According to British newspapers, the Wilson government's decision to hold an early election was an attempt to take advantage of the Conservative Party's slump since its downfall in 1964 and the worsening internal contradictions, to change its fragile position of only having a three-seat majority in the House of Commons to consolidate the Labour Party's rule before Britain's political and economic situation continues to deteriorate.

    This sudden announcement of the general election profoundly reflects the turbulent and unstable political and economic situation in Britain. The Wilson government has been in a precarious state since it came to power in October 1964. The death of a member of parliament and by-elections in evenly matched constituencies can become a matter of life and death for the government. At the same time, it has become increasingly difficult for important and controversial bills proposed by the government to be passed in Parliament.

    What particularly worries the Labour Party is that the British public is increasingly dissatisfied with the Wilson government's obsequious pro-American policy. Its role as an accomplice in the US aggression against Vietnam has been strongly condemned by the British people and ordinary Labour Party members. The "East of Suez" policy pursued by the Wilson government in coordination with the US aggression and war policies in Asia and Africa has caused fierce disputes within the Labour government. Nine African countries severed diplomatic relations with Britain in protest against the British government's colonial policy in Southern Rhodesia... Local journalists here point out that these circumstances indicate that if the situation deteriorates further, it will be difficult for the Labour government to maintain its position.

    英国工党政府内外交困日子难过  宣布提前举行大选力图改善处境
    据新华社伦敦一日电  英国首相威尔逊二月二十八日晚上在首相府宣布，英国在三月三十一日举行新的大选。
    威尔逊发表的声明说，本届议会将在三月十日解散，新的议会将在四月十八日开会。
    威尔逊的声明没有说明上台只有十六个月的工党政府宣布提前大选的原因。但是，这个英国首相十天前在伯明翰举行的一次记者招待会上说得很明白：是否举行新的大选取决于一个政府是不是有能力“继续做它的工作”以及“在同外国政治家打交道时能否明确地代表英国讲话”。
    根据英国现行制度，英国议会每五年改选一次，但是，执政党可以在任期内根据政局变化和执政党本身的利害考虑，宣布提前解散议会和举行大选。
    据英国报纸报道，威尔逊政府决定提前大选是想利用保守党在一九六四年下台以后一蹶不振、党内矛盾越来越严重的条件，抢在英国的政治经济形势将要继续恶化以前，改变它在下院只有三席多数的脆弱地位来巩固工党的统治。
    这次突然宣布大选，深刻地反映了英国的政治和经济形势动荡不稳。威尔逊政府从一九六四年十月上台以来一直处于风雨飘摇的状态。议员的死亡和在势均力敌的选区举行补缺选举都可以成为政府的生死存亡问题。同时，政府提出的重要而有争论的法案已经越来越难以在议会得到通过。
    尤其使工党不安的是：英国公众对威尔逊政府奴颜婢膝的亲美政策日益不满，它在美国侵略越南问题上所扮演的帮凶角色遭到英国人民和工党普通党员的强烈谴责；威尔逊政府配合美国在亚洲和非洲的侵略和战争政策而推行的“苏伊士以东”政策在工党政府内引起剧烈的争吵；九个非洲国家同英国断绝外交关系，抗议英国政府在南罗得西亚的殖民政策……这里的报界人士指出，这种种情况表明，如果局势进一步恶化，工党政府的地位就很难继续维持下去。
