    Seeing Products from the Perspective of Ideology
    Politics is the commander, the soul. How to implement Chairman Mao's instruction in the factory? In the past, my understanding of this was very limited, and I often took detours.
    In the past few years, the syrup in our factory had a high number of colonies (the fewer colonies, the better), which seriously affected product quality. We wanted to solve this problem, but when we looked at the factory building, it was old and dilapidated; when we looked at the equipment, it was all large vats, basins, sticks, and spoons, without the conditions for sealing; and when we looked at the operating methods, everything was manual, bottling, capping, and labeling. In short, we felt there was no way to control the colonies, so we could only "sigh at the ocean's vastness."
    In 1965, we studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers, using the "two-point theory" to find ideological gaps. Only then did we realize that the reason we couldn't control the colonies in the past was not because the factory building was old, but because our thinking was old; not because the equipment was old, but because our thinking was old; not because manual operation was backward, but because our thinking was backward. We only saw machines, equipment, and factory buildings, but we didn't see people, and we didn't realize the great power of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We didn't understand that with ideologically strong people, there would be no worries about high-quality products.
    Once the ideological problem was solved, we saw the favorable conditions, and the direction became clear, and we had sufficient drive. Hygiene is very important to the quality of medicine. Therefore, we started with large-scale sanitation work, which greatly changed the sanitation situation. In terms of process operation, all large and small equipment and tools were sterilized. The workers repaired the walls themselves and installed ultraviolet devices with strong sterilizing power. Due to these measures, hundreds of thousands of colonies were eliminated, and many products reached sterility. The workers were right: "Emphasizing politics can improve quality and eliminate colonies."
    Vice Director of Tianjin Friendship Pharmaceutical Factory Jia Lisuo
    Editor's Note: The same factory building, the same equipment, the same manual operation. Before emphasizing politics, people could only sigh and were powerless. After emphasizing politics, and with Mao Zedong Thought arming their minds, people's mental outlook changed, and they could actively find ways to repair the factory building, improve equipment, change operating methods, and produce sterile products. The experience of the leading cadres of Tianjin Friendship Pharmaceutical Factory once again proves the power of emphasizing politics.

    从思想看产品
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。怎样在工厂里贯彻毛主席这一指示呢？过去我体会得很少，常走一些弯路。
    前几年，我厂糖浆里菌落多（菌落越少越好），严重地影响产品质量。我们想动手解决这个问题，但是，看看房子，又旧又破；看看设备，都是大缸大盆、棍子、勺子，没有条件密闭化；再看看操作方法，全部是手工操作，装瓶，拧盖，贴签，都是如此。总之，觉得没有办法控制菌落，只好“望洋兴叹”。
    一九六五年，我们和职工一起学习毛主席著作，运用两分法，寻找思想上的差距。这才认识到，过去没有能控制菌落，不是房子旧，是思想旧，不是设备老，是思想老，不是手工操作落后，是思想落后。我们只看到机器、设备、厂房，唯独没看到人，没有认识到用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，会有巨大的威力。不懂得有了思想过硬的人，就不愁有高质量的产品。
    思想问题解决了，就看到了有利条件，而且方向明了，干劲足了。卫生，对药品质量有着十分重要的关系。于是，我们就从大搞卫生入手，使卫生面貌大改观。在工艺操作上，把所有的大小设备和工具都消毒灭菌。工人们自己动手修补了墙壁，安装了杀菌力强的紫外线装置。由于采取了这些措施，消灭了成千上万的菌落，不少产品达到无菌。工人说得对：“突出政治，就能提高质量，消灭菌落。”  天津友谊制药厂副厂长  贾力锁
    编者注：同样的厂房，同样的设备，同样是手工操作，没有突出政治之前，人们看着它只能望洋兴叹，无能为力。突出了政治，毛泽东思想武装了头脑，人们的精神面貌变了，就能积极设法修补厂房，改进设备，改变操作方法，制造出无菌产品。天津友谊制药厂领导干部的体会，再一次证明了突出政治的威力。
