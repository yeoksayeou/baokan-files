    How can political work organs better emphasize politics?
    The situation reflected in the symposium of the Finance and Trade Political Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China shows that political work cadres must first take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, transform their subjective world, and be models in emphasizing politics.
    According to the Southern Daily, "Has the political organ emphasized politics? How can politics be emphasized?" Recently, the Finance and Trade Political Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited the directors and propaganda section chiefs of the finance and trade political departments of the prefectural committees and the directors of the propaganda offices of the provincial directly affiliated units to discuss this issue. The situation reflected in the symposium shows that political organs also have the problem of emphasizing or not emphasizing politics. If political organs want to do a good job in political work, they must first require their cadres, especially leading cadres, to take the lead in emphasizing politics, take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and take the lead in transforming their world outlook.
    Will political organs naturally emphasize politics?
    Some political cadres once believed that political organs do political and ideological work every day, so of course they emphasize politics. Is this actually the case? Everyone believes that since the establishment of the finance and trade political organs at all levels in Guangdong Province, they have done some political work under the leadership of the Party committee, but it cannot be said that this is equivalent to emphasizing politics. Everyone has identified some manifestations of the failure to emphasize politics in the current finance and trade system's political organs: mainly, they do not study Chairman Mao's works seriously, do not thoroughly understand the spirit of the instructions from above, and do not keep up closely. Some political cadres have a floating work style, do not go deep into reality, do not go deep into the masses, and have not well grasped the living thoughts of the masses. One comrade examined himself and said: He has worked in the prefectural committee organ for three years, but his time in the countryside is less than three months, and his furthest footprint only reached the commune Party committee. He is unclear about what is above and unclear about what is below. Some political cadres are busy all day with routine administrative work, and the focus is not on ideological work. Some political cadres only focus on completing current business work, only grasp the "small guarantee," and even leave their political work posts to engage in purely business activities, without putting their main energy on grasping the ideological revolutionization of people, this "big guarantee."
    Why have political organs not been able to emphasize politics? Everyone analyzed that emphasizing politics and not emphasizing politics is a struggle between the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism. This struggle will inevitably be reflected in the revolutionary ranks and will also be reflected in political organs. Therefore, in political organs and among political cadres, there will also be phenomena of not emphasizing politics. Therefore, political organs and political cadres must consciously carry out ideological struggle, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and continuously improve their understanding of the great strategic significance of emphasizing politics. Some comrades examined themselves and said that they had fallen into blindness on this issue, believing that they were already "red," arrogant and complacent, superior to others; only paying attention to educating others, neglecting or forgetting to transform themselves; only requiring others to study, but relaxing their own study, and even when studying, it was often to "arm their mouths," not primarily to arm their own minds. Everyone believes that this is the crux of the current failure of political organs to emphasize politics well.
    Why should political organs emphasize emphasizing politics even more?
    When talking about why political organs should emphasize emphasizing politics even more, everyone believed that the current situation of emphasizing politics is indeed very good. After the great debate on the relationship between politics and business in various places, more and more people attach importance to political work, the enthusiasm of workers and masses for studying Chairman Mao's works is increasing step by step, and the ranks of political workers are also more complete than in the past. These are all favorable conditions for doing a good job in political work. However, it should be seen that under the new situation, many new problems have been raised, the requirements for political work are higher, and the burden on political organs has not been reduced but increased. Therefore, political organs at all levels and every political cadre must establish lofty ideals, keep up with the new situation, shoulder heavy burdens, strictly demand themselves, and put in greater hard work in emphasizing politics.
    Everyone talked about the importance of emphasizing politics in political organs from their own personal experience. They said that political organs are the command headquarters on the political and ideological front, and they are responsible for grasping the ideological revolutionization of people. To correct others, one must first correct oneself. If one is not revolutionized oneself, how can one guide others to revolutionize? If one does not transform one's own thinking, how can one help others transform their thinking? If one does not study hard, how can one motivate others to study? One comrade gave an example: There are two stores in their coal construction company. One was originally backward, but because the political instructor sent by the higher level was humble and eager to learn, had a hardworking and in-depth work style, and cooperated well with the store director, the store finally changed from backward to advanced. The other was an advanced store, but because the political instructor was arrogant and self-righteous and did not get along with the store director, the store became backward. Some comrades examined themselves and said that when they approached the masses, they did not treat them with sincerity, but put on a teaching posture, and as a result, the masses respected them from a distance. After the socialist education movement, they realized their shortcomings, and when they talked to the masses, they first bared their hearts, and the masses were willing to tell them their innermost thoughts. Many comrades have the experience that as a political cadre, if one's own ideological problems are not solved, grasping the living thoughts of the workers will not hit the mark, will not dig to the root, and will not set a good example, and will not achieve good results. Therefore, when political cadres start to solve the problems of the workers, they must first examine themselves, improve themselves, and use their own revolutionization to drive the revolutionization of the workers.
    How can political organs better emphasize politics?
    Everyone also studied how political organs can better emphasize politics. It was unanimously believed that the most fundamental measure is to put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in their work and put the transformation of world outlook in the first place in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Political cadres must honestly work hard on promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology and transforming their thinking, thoroughly overcome all forms of bourgeois individualism, establish a thorough proletarian world outlook, and do political work for the rest of their lives. Political organs must adhere to the "three firsts," that is, when deploying, inspecting, and summarizing work, first deploy, inspect, and summarize whether they have emphasized politics and whether they have creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works.
    Everyone particularly pointed out that political cadres must step out of the office, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the front lines, go deep into the masses, participate in labor, do concrete work, and transform their subjective world in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements. The political departments at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels should follow the "three-three system" principle, ensuring that one-third of the people are stationed at selected points, one-third of the people are running around, and one-third of the people are managing the house; each person has one-third of their time stationed at selected points each year, one-third of their time running around, and one-third of their time staying at home. Leading cadres above the level of political instructor should generally go to the grassroots level to take temporary positions and stay at selected points this year, serving as deputy political instructors, to cultivate models of how political organs can emphasize politics (how to be a good political instructor).
    Everyone also proposed that political organs must resolutely get rid of unnecessary routine and administrative work, "giving up something to gain something," stand at the breakthrough point, implement face-to-face leadership, systematically grasp the ideological dynamics of the workers, be good at grasping the main contradictions, proactively do ideological work, solve problems on the spot, solve problems based on the specific issues, and solve problems in a timely manner.

    政治工作机关怎样才能更好地突出政治？
    中共广东省委财贸政治部座谈会反映的情况表明，政治工作干部首先要带头活学活用毛主席著作，改造主观世界，做突出政治的模范。
    据南方日报报道　“政治机关是不是突出了政治？怎样才能突出政治？”最近，中共广东省委财贸政治部邀集地委财贸政治部主任、宣传科科长和省直属单位宣传处处长，座谈了这一问题。座谈中反映出来的情况表明：政治机关同样存在着突出不突出政治的问题；政治机关要做好政治工作，首先要求它的干部，特别是领导干部带头突出政治，带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头改造世界观。
    政治机关是不是会
    自然突出政治？
    有一部分政治干部曾经认为：政治机关天天做政治思想工作，当然是突出政治了。实际情况是不是这样呢？大家认为，广东省各级财贸政治机关从成立以来，在党委的领导下，做了一些政治工作，但不能说就等于突出了政治。大家检查出，目前财贸系统各级政治机关还有一些不突出政治的表现：主要是对毛主席著作学得不认真，对上头的指示精神吃得不透，跟得不紧。有些政治干部作风漂浮，不深入实际，不深入群众，没有很好地掌握群众的活思想。有一个同志检查说：自己在地委机关工作了三年，下乡的时间却不到三个月，足迹最远只走到公社党委会，对上头闹不清，对下头也闹不清。还有一些政治干部成天忙于事务性行政性的工作，重点没有放在思想工作上。也有一些政治干部单从完成当前业务工作着眼，只抓了“小保证”，甚至离开政治工作岗位去单纯搞业务，没有把主要精力放在抓人的思想革命化这个“大保证”上面来。
    政治机关为什么没有能够突出政治呢？大家分析说，突出政治和不突出政治，是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。这个斗争必然要反映到革命队伍中来，同样也反映到政治机关中来。因此，在政治机关中，在政治干部身上，也会存在不突出政治的现象。因此，政治机关和政治干部要自觉地开展思想斗争，兴无灭资，不断提高对突出政治的伟大战略意义的认识。有些同志检查说，自己在这个问题上恰恰陷入了盲目性，自认为已经“红”了，骄傲自满，高人一等；只注意教育别人，忽视或忘记了改造自己；只要求别人学习，自己却放松学习，即使学习，也往往是为了“武装嘴巴”，不是首先为了武装自己的头脑。大家认为，这就是当前政治机关不能很好地突出政治的症结所在。
    政治机关为什么更
  要强调突出政治？
    在谈到政治机关为什么更要强调突出政治的问题时，大家认为，当前突出政治的形势确实很好，各地经过政治和业务关系的大辩论，越来越多的人重视政治工作，职工群众学习毛主席著作的热情步步高涨，政治工作人员的队伍也比过去健全，这些都是做好政治工作的有利条件。但是，应该看到在新的形势下，许多新问题被提出来了，对政治工作的要求更高了，政治机关身上的担子不是减轻而是加重了。因此，各级政治机关和每个政治干部必须树立远大理想，跟上新形势，挑起重担子，严格要求自己，在突出政治方面下更大的苦功。
    大家从自己的切身体会，谈了政治机关强调突出政治的重要性。他们说，政治机关是政治思想战线上的指挥部，是抓人的思想革命化的。正人先正己。如果自己不革命化，怎么能够引导别人革命化？自己不改造思想，怎么能够帮助别人改造思想？自己不好好学习，又怎么能够带动别人学习？有一个同志举出一个事例：他们那里的煤建公司有两家商店，一家原来是落后的，由于上级派去的政治指导员虚心好学，作风艰苦深入，同商店主任合作得很好，终于使商店由落后变为先进；另一家是先进的商店，但由于政治指导员高傲自大，同商店主任合不来，反而使商店落后了。有的同志检查说：自己接近群众的时候，不是推心置腹，而是摆出一副教人的架势，结果群众就敬而远之；经过社会主义教育运动，认识到自己的缺点，同群众谈话时先交心，群众也就乐于同自己说心里话了。许多同志都有这样的体会：作为一个政治干部，自己的思想问题不解决，抓职工的活思想，就抓不到点子上，挖不到根子上，也做不出好榜样，收不到好效果。因此，政治干部在着手解决职工问题的时候，先要检查自己，提高自己，用自己的革命化去带动职工的革命化。
    政治机关怎样才能
  更好地突出政治？
    大家还研究了政治机关怎样才能更好地突出政治的问题。一致认为，最根本的措施是一定要把学习毛主席著作摆在自己工作的首位，把改造世界观摆在学习毛主席著作的首位。政治干部要老老实实地在兴无灭资、改造思想上狠下功夫，彻底克服形形色色的资产阶级个人主义，树立彻底的无产阶级世界观，干一辈子政治工作。政治机关要坚持“三个首先”，即在布置、检查、总结工作时，首先布置、检查、总结自己是否突出了政治，是否活学活用毛主席著作。
    大家特别提出，政治干部一定要走出办公室，深入基层，深入现场，深入群众，参加劳动，做具体工作，在三大革命运动的实践中改造主观世界。省、地、县三级政治部要按照“三三制”的原则，做到有三分之一的人蹲点，三分之一的人跑面，三分之一的人管家；每个人每年有三分之一的时间蹲点，三分之一的时间跑面，三分之一的时间留家。政治教导员以上的领导干部，今年要普遍下基层代职蹲点，当副政治指导员，培养政治机关如何突出政治（怎样当好政治指导员）的样板。
    大家还提出，政治机关要坚决摆脱那些不必要的事务性、行政性工作，“有所舍才能有所取”，站到突破口上来，实行面对面的领导，系统地掌握职工的思想动态，善于抓住主要矛盾，有预见性地把思想工作做到前头，做到就地解决问题，就事解决问题，及时解决问题。（附图片）
