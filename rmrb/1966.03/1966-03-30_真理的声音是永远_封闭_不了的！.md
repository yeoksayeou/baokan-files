    The Voice of Truth Can Never Be "Silenced"!
    In recent months, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, while conducting rampant anti-China activities, have been vigorously attacking Chinese news agencies and radio stations. Right-wing newspapers have long been clamoring to drive out Xinhua News Agency reporters. The Indonesian Journalists Association, controlled by the right wing, has also issued statements demanding that the government "expel" Chinese journalists. On March 25, the Indonesian government indeed yielded to the right-wing reactionary forces and announced the "temporary closure" of the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch. The Chinese people express great indignation at this.
    Since its establishment, the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch has consistently provided truthful and correct reports, based on the stance of benefiting the Indonesian people's struggle against old and new colonialism and safeguarding national independence, and from the perspective of strengthening the militant friendship between the two peoples. The Xinhua branch's position has remained consistent for twelve years. The work of the Xinhua branch has been highly praised by people from all walks of life in Indonesia. However, in recent months, the Indonesian right-wing forces have been constantly attacking and persecuting the Xinhua branch. Now, the Indonesian government has brazenly closed the Xinhua branch. What exactly is the reason for this? It is simply because our reporters reported on the various atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces after the September 30th Movement, including anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China, and persecution of overseas Chinese. They said that this reporting by Chinese journalists was a "slander" against the Republic of Indonesia, "inciting discord," "hostile propaganda," "interference in internal affairs," "undermining" the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and "damaging Indonesia's international reputation." This is a complete distortion of facts and nonsense.
    As everyone knows, after the September 30th Movement, a violent anti-communist and anti-people wave occurred in Indonesia. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces launched an unprecedented persecution and suppression against the Indonesian Communist Party and progressive forces. They arrested hundreds of thousands of people, massacred hundreds of thousands, and incited hysterical anti-communist frenzy everywhere. These are universally known facts, and have been reported by news agencies of various countries. Why are Chinese journalists uniquely forbidden from reporting? Is it not a bad thing that the right-wing reactionary forces committed unprecedented bloody anti-communist and anti-people atrocities in Indonesian history, while Chinese journalists reporting them truthfully is "slander"?
    Everyone also knows that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, while creating anti-communist and anti-people atrocities, also stirred up a wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment. The right-wing forces launched all their propaganda machines, clamoring against China and inciting racist emotions. They organized anti-China demonstrations everywhere. They gathered thugs to attack and destroy overseas Chinese organizations, smash overseas Chinese schools and shops, plunder overseas Chinese property, burn overseas Chinese houses, and even beat, kidnap, and massacre our compatriots. They openly dispatched armed forces and directed thugs to attack our embassy, commercial counselor's office, consulate, and Xinhua branch in Indonesia, damaging the buildings of our diplomatic missions in Indonesia and injuring our diplomatic officials and journalists. May we ask, why can't Chinese journalists truthfully report on the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' rampant anti-China and persecution of overseas Chinese? Are these appalling atrocities committed by the Indonesian right wing against China "justified," while Chinese journalists reporting them are engaged in "hostile propaganda" and committing a crime?
    The anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities manufactured by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are a brazen trampling and violation of international law, and an unadulterated fascist act. Faced with the bloody reality of rampant anti-China sentiment and persecution of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, any just and upright journalist cannot turn a deaf ear and remain silent, let alone a Chinese journalist. Chinese journalists have every right and responsibility to report to the world on the racist acts of the Indonesian right-wing forces. This is self-evident and completely justified.
    Obviously, if it is said that someone has "slandered" the Republic of Indonesia, "undermined" the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and "damaged" Indonesia's international reputation, then it is none other than the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. It is not we who are interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, but the Indonesian government that is interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese press, attempting to deprive the Chinese press of the right to report the truth.
    Frankly speaking, the Chinese journalists' reports on the anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China, and anti-Chinese atrocities that occurred in Indonesia are far from being as thorough as the atrocities themselves. We have not reported too much, but too little. Even until today, the Chinese press has not published any comments on the changes in the Indonesian situation in recent months. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces frantically attacked Chinese news agencies and their journalists, and the Indonesian government, under orders, closed the Xinhua branch, simply to shut the mouths of others after the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces committed heinous crimes. However, no one can deprive Chinese journalists of the right to report the truth by any means. The Indonesian government can close the Xinhua branch, but it can never "close" the voice of truth!
    As the right-wing reactionary forces are rampantly anti-China, the Indonesian government's explicit order to close the Xinhua branch is clearly a deliberate attempt to worsen the relations between China and Indonesia. We want to solemnly warn the Indonesian government that you have gone far enough in this regard. If you continue down the path of deteriorating relations between the two countries, then you must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 真理的声音是永远“封闭”不了的！

    真理的声音是永远“封闭”不了的！
    近几个月来，印度尼西亚的右派反动势力在进行猖狂的反华活动的时候，大肆攻击中国的通讯社和广播电台。右派报纸早就在吵吵嚷嚷要赶走新华社记者。右派控制的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会也曾发表声明，要求政府把中国记者“驱逐”出去。三月二十五日，印度尼西亚政府果然听命于右派反动势力，宣布“暂时封闭”新华社驻雅加达分社。中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨。
    新华社驻雅加达分社建立以来，从有利于印度尼西亚人民反对新老殖民主义、维护民族独立斗争的立场出发，从加强两国人民的战斗友谊出发，一贯进行真实的、正确的报道。新华分社的这种立场，十二年来如一日。新华分社的工作，受到了印度尼西亚各界人士的高度评价。但是，最近几个月来，印度尼西亚右派势力一直不断地攻击和迫害新华分社。现在印度尼西亚政府悍然封闭新华分社，这究竟是什么原因呢？无非是因为我们的记者报道了印度尼西亚右派反动势力在九月三十日事件以后进行的反共、反人民、反华和迫害华侨的种种暴行。他们说，中国记者的这种报道是对印度尼西亚共和国的“诬蔑”，是“煽动不和”、“敌对宣传”、
  “干涉内政”，是“破坏”中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系，是“败坏了印度尼西亚的国际声誉”。这完全是颠倒黑白，胡说八道。
    大家知道，在九月三十日事件以后，在印度尼西亚发生了狂暴的反共、反人民浪潮。印度尼西亚右派反动势力向印度尼西亚共产党和进步力量发动了空前规模的迫害和镇压。他们逮捕了几十万人，屠杀了数以十万计的人，到处煽动了歇斯底里的反共狂。这些都是举世周知的事实，并且见之于各国通讯社的报道，为什么独独不许中国记者报道呢？难道右派反动势力干出了印度尼西亚历史上罕见的反共、反人民血腥暴行不是坏事，而中国记者如实地加以报道反而是“诬蔑”吗？
    大家也知道，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在制造反共、反人民的暴行的同时，还掀起了一股反华和排华的妖风。右派势力开动了他们的全部宣传机器，叫嚣反华，煽动种族主义情绪。他们到处组织反华的示威游行。他们纠集暴徒袭击和破坏华侨社团，捣毁华侨学校和商店，掠夺华侨财产，焚烧华侨房屋，以至殴打、绑架和惨杀我国的侨胞。他们公然派遣武装部队和指使暴徒袭击我国驻印度尼西亚的大使馆、商务参赞处、领事馆和新华分社，破坏我国驻印度尼西亚外交机构的建筑物，打伤我国的外交官员和新闻记者。试问，印度尼西亚的右派反动势力这样放肆地反华和迫害华侨，为什么中国记者反倒不能如实地加以报道呢？难道印度尼西亚右派反对中国的这些骇人听闻的暴行都是“正当”的，而中国记者加以报道就是“敌对宣传”，就犯了罪吗？
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力制造的反华、排华暴行，是对国际公法的肆无忌惮的践踏和蹂躏，是不折不扣的法西斯行为。面对着印度尼西亚发生的这种猖狂反华和迫害华侨的血淋淋的现实，任何一个具有正义感的正直的新闻记者，都不能充耳不闻，默不作声，何况是中国自己的新闻记者呢？中国的记者有一切权利，也有责任向全世界报道印度尼西亚右派势力的种族主义行径。这是天经地义的，是完全正当的。
    显然，如果说到有谁“诬蔑”了印度尼西亚共和国，“破坏”了中国和印度尼西亚友好关系，“败坏”了印度尼西亚的国际声誉的话，那末，这不是别人，正是印度尼西亚的右派反动势力。不是我们干涉印度尼西亚内政，倒是印度尼西亚政府干涉中国新闻界的内部事务，企图剥夺中国新闻界报道事实真相的权利。
    老实说，中国记者对于印度尼西亚发生的反共、反人民、反华、排华暴行的报道，比起这种暴行本身来，是远远不够充分的。我们不是报道得太多，而是报道得太少了。甚至直到今天以前，中国新闻界对印度尼西亚近几个月来的形势变化，还没有发表任何评论。印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂地攻击中国的通讯社和它的记者，印度尼西亚政府奉命封闭新华分社，无非是要在印度尼西亚右派反动势力干出了滔天罪行之后，还要堵住别人的嘴。但是，任何人采取任何手段，要想剥夺中国新闻工作者报道事实真相的权利，那是绝对办不到的。印度尼西亚政府尽可以封闭新华分社，但是它永远不能“封闭”真理的声音！
    正当右派反动势力猖狂反华之际，印度尼西亚政府明令封闭新华分社，这显然是蓄意恶化中国和印度尼西亚两国的关系。我们要正告印度尼西亚政府，你们在这方面已经走得够远了。如果你们继续沿着恶化两国关系这条路走下去，那么，你们必须对由此而产生的一切后果承担全部责任。
