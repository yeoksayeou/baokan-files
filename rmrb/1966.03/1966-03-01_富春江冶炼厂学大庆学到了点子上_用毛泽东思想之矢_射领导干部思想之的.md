    Editor's Note: The Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant has changed, from a backward enterprise to an advanced one. How did this enterprise change? Because the leaders of the enterprise changed, from unconsciously revolutionary to consciously revolutionary. And how did the leaders change? Because their attitude towards studying Chairman Mao's works changed. Previously, they studied Chairman Mao's works to educate others. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's works to transform themselves first. All the changes at the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant started here.
    For many leading cadres, there should be such a change in studying Chairman Mao's works, from only wanting to educate others to first transforming themselves. We say that to put great effort into the "use" of studying Chairman Mao's works, we must first put great effort into using it to transform our own thinking.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for transforming the subjective world and the objective world. To transform the objective world, we must first transform the subjective world. To transform the subjective world of those being led, we must first transform the subjective world of the leaders themselves. If you cannot correct yourself, how can you correct others?
    Daqing's "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi said it well: "The workers' problems are the cadres' problems, the problems below are the leaders' problems, and all problems are ideological problems." This is an important experience in building a revolutionary enterprise in Daqing. The leaders of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant learned this experience and took great strides forward on the road of revolutionization.
    From a Backward Enterprise to an Advanced Enterprise
    A small factory in the mountain recesses of Fuchunjiang—the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant—since learning from Daqing in 1964, has greatly developed its revolutionary spirit and greatly changed its enterprise appearance, becoming an advanced unit in the national metallurgical system, known as the "Little Daqing" of Zhejiang Province.
    The Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant was a small factory built in 1958 using indigenous methods. In the early days of its construction, it relied entirely on hand-operated bellows for production in earthen furnaces. The first batch of semi-finished products it produced weighed only eight liang and three qian. Through the efforts of the employees over the years, especially since learning from Daqing, the production level of this factory has risen rapidly, and it has gradually built a small non-ferrous metal joint enterprise that combines indigenous and foreign methods and continuously improves its degree of mechanization.
    In the first year of learning from Daqing—1964—they removed the label of continuous losses for five years since the plant was built, and turned over a considerable amount of profit to the state; in the second year of learning from Daqing—1965—they achieved a comprehensive leap forward in production, with output doubling that of the previous year, and profits turned over exceeding more than three times that of 1964. Some major economic and technical indicators have caught up with or exceeded the domestic advanced level, and manual operation has been basically changed to mechanization. They vigorously developed comprehensive utilization, and in addition to the main products, they have also produced five kinds of by-products, including two kinds of precious metals.
    How did the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant learn from Daqing?
    Their experience, in summary, is: give prominence to politics, adhere to taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link; leading cadres take the lead in conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's works, and constantly promote ideological revolutionization; take the lead in conscientiously participating in labor, and always maintain the true color of laborers; take the lead in conscientiously implementing the four major democracies and rely on the working class to run the enterprise.
    From Unconsciously Revolutionary to Consciously Revolutionary
    To learn from Daqing, it is necessary to start with the revolutionization of the leadership. From the beginning of learning from Daqing, the leaders of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant have continuously used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their non-proletarian ideology, and with the spirit of thorough self-revolution, drive all the employees of the plant to continuously revolutionize.
    In the first few years of the plant's construction, although it exceeded the state plan every year, it lost money year after year. At that time, the leading cadres of the factory did not look for the reasons subjectively, but often pushed the responsibility onto objective factors, and even thought that "small-scale smelting enterprises cannot avoid losing money," and complacently wore a "loss hat" on their heads.
    In 1963, Party Secretary Yi Fang'an and Factory Director Yu Jinluan attended the industrial conference held by the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, and after hearing the experiences of many brother factories in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, they began to feel that the "loss hat" on their heads was a kind of pressure. After returning to the factory, when implementing the spirit of the conference, the workers also raised many opinions on the waste phenomenon and the work style of the cadres in the factory, which touched the leading cadres of the factory even more.
    At the beginning of 1964, the revolutionary fire of the Daqing spirit burned to the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant. The leading cadres of the factory could no longer sit still. They conveyed Daqing's experience to all the employees of the factory, and the emotions of the masses were like the water of the Fuchunjiang River, with rolling waves. Everyone was determined to remove the loss hat and "throw it into the Fuchunjiang River." The workers' letters of determination and guarantees were posted on the walls of the workshops, dormitories, and canteens within a few days, demanding that the factory Party committee immediately wave the banner and lead everyone to make revolution and remove the loss hat.
    The revolutionary determination of the employees greatly educated the leading cadres of the factory. The Party committee held many meetings in a row, believing that to lead the employees to revolutionize the backward fate of the enterprise, it is necessary to first revolutionize the backward fate of the ideology, especially to have the leading cadres take the lead in self-revolution. The eight Party committee members conducted recollections and comparisons of the life of the old and new societies at the Party committee meeting to conduct self-class education. Most of them examined their thinking of being content with the status quo that "the revolution has reached the top," and some painfully examined that they had the idea of being an "official" in the past few years, accustomed to squatting in the office, relying on listening to reports to understand the situation, directing production, and abandoning the good traditions of going deep into reality and contacting the masses in the past. Those who originally complained that the higher authorities did not provide enough help now also realized that it was not that the higher authorities did not provide enough help, but that here, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought was not held high enough. After recollection and comparison, the members of the Party committee vowed to learn and use Chairman Mao's works well, and together with all the employees of the factory, learn from the Daqing people and take the Daqing road.
    From Only Educating Others to First Transforming Oneself
    In the past, the purpose of leading cadres in studying Chairman Mao's works was not clear. They believed that learning was for educating workers. After learning from Daqing, they clarified that Chairman Mao's works should first be used to transform themselves. Party Secretary Yi Fang'an took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works to transform his own thinking, determined to be a "yellow ox" serving the people like the Daqing cadres. One deputy factory director used to have a bad relationship with the masses. For a long time, he attributed the reason for this contradiction to "the backwardness of the masses." The more he thought this way, the more he simply criticized the lower levels, and the more tense his relationship with the masses became. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized that the main aspect of this contradiction was in himself, not in the masses. His bad relationship with the masses was not because the masses were backward, but because he lacked the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and lacked a mass viewpoint. After examining the shortcomings in himself, he changed his past work style of saying more and doing less, criticizing the lower levels more and examining himself less, and used the spirit of self-criticism and exemplary actions to improve his relationship with the masses. As a result, the relationship became harmonious, and his work was also more handy than before.
    All the members of the factory Party committee took the lead in studying and using Chairman Mao's works in this way. When arranging, reporting, inspecting, and summarizing work, they first arranged, reported, inspected, and summarized the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works. No matter how tight the task, they had to ensure that learning was not squeezed out. Leading cadres also carried Chairman Mao's books with them when they went out to meetings or squatted in working groups for labor. Factory Director Yu Jinluan, who was more than fifty years old, studied with his reading glasses whenever he had time. Many young workers said with emotion: "The factory director is so old, but he still grasps the study of Chairman Mao's works so tightly. To be good successors to the revolution, we must study Chairman Mao's works even more carefully."
    Use Mao Zedong Thought to Create a Revolutionary Team
    The leading cadres of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant not only required themselves to study and use Chairman Mao's works well, but also put arming the employees with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the workforce at the top of all the enterprise's work. They repeatedly explained the significance of studying Chairman Mao's works among the employees, established typical examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and widely exchanged experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. They also organized workers to visit class education exhibitions and listen to old workers give reports comparing the past and the present, guiding the employees to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way with class feelings. Therefore, a new atmosphere of reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words has formed throughout the factory. Many people have read articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Combat Liberalism" more than a dozen or dozens of times. The workers deeply realized that "Chairman Mao's works should be studied every day. Today's study has today's benefits, tomorrow's study has tomorrow's benefits, and more study leads to more progress." Many workers used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to consciously examine their past erroneous thoughts such as doing work mainly to "support their families," and understood the principle of working for the revolution, and their revolutionary spirit was greatly developed.
    Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, backward workers have become advanced, advanced workers have become even more advanced, and a large number of new people and new things have emerged.
    Mine transport worker Lou Jinbao used to be a farmer who pinched iron rakes, and after entering the factory, he was still doing the work of pinching iron rakes. He felt that he was not promising and was not at ease with his work. After studying articles such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Serve the People," he raised his class consciousness and realized that pinching iron rakes was also revolutionary work, and regardless of wind or rain, he always ran to the front when something happened. This worker who used to "not care about anything" has now become an advanced producer who "cares about everything."
    Five-good miner Zhao Laohu regarded Chairman Mao's works as a guiding light, and studied them whenever he had time, asked questions when he didn't understand, and used them after studying them. During a typhoon and rainstorm, he bravely took the lead in rescuing the materials in the warehouse.
    Zhejiang Province advanced producer Zhang Yongren, after studying Chairman Mao's works, never forgot to build the country with diligence and thrift. He suggested that the factory retrieve more than 20 tons of furnace slag with recycling value from the old factory site, adding more than 10,000 yuan to the state's wealth.
    Excellent warehouse keeper Yu Jikui studied Chairman Mao's works with class feelings and vowed to be a new socialist Foolish Old Man. He worked hard to develop a solid skill and could quickly and accurately take out any one of the more than 2,000 items he kept in the dark.
    Chemist Qi Sixiao, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," was determined to be a selfless person. On the way to the mining area to retrieve samples, he encountered a torrential rain and unhesitatingly threw himself on more than 40 bags of samples to prevent them from being damaged.
    Now, in the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant, everyone cares about politics, everyone does ideological and political work, not only the leaders do the ideological work of the employees, but also the employees do the ideological work of the leaders. In the past, the Party committee members who were specifically in charge of political work had dozens of people coming to him every month, asking him to help solve problems, and often could not solve them completely. Now, wherever there is a problem, there is someone doing ideological and political work, basically achieving that problems do not leave the work group and contradictions are not handed over.
    The revolutionary team armed with Mao Zedong Thought can hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, strive forward, overcome all difficulties, and carry out creative labor. The leading cadres of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant promptly guided this revolutionary enthusiasm of the employees to the key to production and concentrated their efforts to fight annihilation battles. In the "battle" to reverse the long-term loss-making situation of the enterprise, the employees completed the repair of the reverberatory furnace one month ahead of schedule under the difficult conditions of tight time and insufficient labor, and then carried out the "Three-Month Great Battle." As a result, the output and labor productivity of this month were greatly improved, the product quality was good, the production cost was low, and the first profit was 441 yuan. Although this number was very small, it broke the superstition that "small-scale smelting enterprises cannot avoid losing money," greatly liberated the employees' thinking, and encouraged them to win greater victories, and finally changed from loss to profit in the year of learning from Daqing, removing the hat of enterprise losses.
    From Not Believing in the Masses to Relying on the Masses Wholeheartedly
    The leading cadres of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant realized that a good workforce is brought out by good leading cadres. And if leading cadres want to have a good work style that is hard to fault, and maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the employees, they must participate in labor like ordinary laborers, and do real work and practical work. Party Secretary Yi Fang'an is one of the cadres who participates in labor the most impeccably. After returning from the Daqing study tour, he was the first to move into the workers' dormitory and went to the most difficult posts to do the dirtiest and heaviest work. He carried stones with his bare back, his hands and feet were blistered, and his back was tanned black, but he never complained. The workers said that he looked like a people's "old yellow ox."
    Under the leadership of the leading cadres, all the cadres in the factory also went down to participate in labor. Wherever it was most difficult and wherever was the key, they went there to work. In the cold winter and flying snow, the mine was the coldest, and there were cadres there pushing mine carts with the workers; in the dog days of summer, the front of the furnace was the hottest, and there were cadres there doing smelting with the workers. All the major types of work, whether day shift or night shift, had cadres there working shifts. They gradually changed from laymen to experts, achieving to be both an ordinary laborer and a good leader. In the past two years, the cadres of the entire factory participated in labor for an average of one-third of the time each month.
    Through participating in labor, the cadres established deep class feelings with the workers and cared more about the workers' labor conditions. The sintering process in the smelting workshop was the place with the worst labor conditions in the entire factory, with high temperatures, heavy sulfur gas, heavy dust, and a lot of effort. In the past, cadres did not participate in labor here much and did not understand the workers' suffering. Therefore, when the production of sintered blocks could not keep up with production needs, the factory director criticized the workshop director, the workshop director complained to the section chief, and the section chief blamed the workers. After the cadres of the factory Party committee and relevant sections worked shifts here, they personally experienced the fatigue in the operation and regarded improving the labor conditions here as a major issue related to class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and production viewpoint. After repeated experiments, the new technology of machine-made balls was successfully used to replace the original backward method, which greatly improved the labor conditions, saved two-thirds of the labor force, reduced costs, and doubled output.
    In the past, the leading cadres did not have enough understanding of the infinite wisdom and great creativity of the working masses, and they always believed in themselves more and believed in the masses less. Therefore, they formulated many "checkpoints" that bound the creativity of the working masses. For example, Wang Shuid, a forger in the machine repair workshop, repeatedly suggested changing the hand-forging hammer to mechanical forging, but he had never received support from the leadership. The technical department wanted him to produce a design sketch, and the leading cadres of the factory were also afraid that he would spend money and fail. In this way, this innovation suggestion was shelved for five years. After learning from Daqing, the leading cadres of the factory established the idea of relying on the working class wholeheartedly to run the enterprise, abolished unreasonable rules and regulations, and encouraged employees to innovate boldly. The leading cadres took the lead in promoting democracy and consulted with the working masses on everything. This mobilized the enthusiasm of the working masses to be masters of their own affairs to the greatest extent. The entire factory, from top to bottom, strove forward, worked hard, and the flowers of technological innovation bloomed everywhere. The heavy hand-forging hammer was reformed into mechanical forging in less than a month. The leaching tower and dust collection equipment for recovering concentrate powder and other by-products from smoke and dust, the flat cars for casting metal semi-finished products, and a total of dozens of major innovation projects were successfully achieved one after another. These innovation projects required little investment, were built quickly, and yielded great results. After being applied in production, they achieved the results of more, faster, better, and more economical. ×××
    When reviewing the path they have taken in the past, the leading cadres of the Fuchunjiang Smelting Plant deeply realized that to run a socialist enterprise well, it is necessary to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics at all times, rely closely on the working masses, and continuously revolutionize and continuously move forward. Since the beginning of this year, in the spirit of finding shortcomings after winning battles, they have further examined the weak links in the enterprise's management work. They are determined to give more prominence to politics, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, fully develop the human factor, organize and implement the masses' high revolutionary enthusiasm to specific production posts, carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the campaign to compare with, learn from, catch up with, and help each other, and seize new victories.

    富春江冶炼厂学大庆学到了点子上
    用毛泽东思想之矢  射领导干部思想之的
    编者按：富春江冶炼厂变了，从一个落后的企业变成一个先进的企业。这个企业是怎样变的呢？因为企业的领导人变了，从不自觉革命变得自觉革命了。领导人又是怎样变的呢？因为他们对学习毛泽东同志著作的态度变了。从前，他们是为了教育别人而学习毛泽东同志著作。后来，他们是为了首先改造自己而学习毛泽东同志著作。富春江冶炼厂的一切变化，都从这里开始了。
    对于许多领导干部来说，学习毛泽东同志著作，都应该有一个这样的变化，从只想教育别人变到首先改造自己。我们说，学习毛泽东同志著作要在用字上狠下功夫，首先就要在用来改造自己的思想上狠下功夫。
    毛泽东思想是改造主观世界和客观世界的最有力的武器。要改造客观世界，首先要改造主观世界。要改造被领导者的主观世界，首先要改造领导者自己的主观世界。不能正己，焉能正人？
    大庆“铁人”王进喜说得好：“工人的问题是干部的问题，下面的问题是领导的问题，一切问题是思想问题。”这是大庆建设革命化企业的一个重要经验。富春江冶炼厂的领导人学到了这个经验，就在革命化道路上大踏步前进了。
    从落后企业变为先进企业
    富春江畔山岙［ào　奥］里的一个小工厂——富春江冶炼厂，一九六四年学大庆以来，革命精神大发扬，企业面貌大变样，成为全国冶金系统的一个先进单位，被誉为浙江省的“小大庆”。
    富春江冶炼厂，是在一九五八年用土法建成的一个小工厂，初建时，全靠手拉风箱的土炉生产，炼出的第一炉半成品，只有八斤三两重。经过职工几年来的努力，特别是学习大庆以来，这个工厂的生产水平迅速上升，逐步建成了一个土洋结合、机械化程度不断提高的小型有色金属联合企业。
    学大庆的第一年——一九六四年，他们摘掉了建厂五年来连年亏损的帽子，向国家上交了数目可观的利润；学大庆的第二年——一九六五年，他们又在生产上实现了全面跃进，产量比上一年提高了一倍，上交利润超过了一九六四年的三倍以上，有些主要经济技术指标赶上或超过了国内先进水平，手工操作基本上改变为机械化。他们大搞综合利用，除主产品外，又搞成了包括两种贵重金属在内的五种副产品。
    富春江冶炼厂是怎样学大庆的呢？
    他们的经验，概括起来，就是：突出政治，坚持以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲；领导干部带头认真学习毛主席著作，不断促进思想革命化；带头认真参加劳动，始终保持劳动者的本色；带头认真实行四大民主，依靠工人阶级办企业。
    从不自觉革命变为自觉革命
    学大庆，要从领导革命化做起。富春江冶炼厂的领导，从学大庆一开始，就用毛泽东思想不断地改造自己的非无产阶级思想，以彻底的自我革命精神，带动全厂职工不断革命。
    建厂最初的几年，这个工厂虽然每年超额完成国家计划，但是连年亏损。工厂领导干部当时不从主观上找原因，往往把责任推到客观上去，甚至以为“办小型冶炼企业非亏本不可”，心安理得地把一顶“亏损帽子”戴在头上。
    一九六三年，党委书记伊方安和厂长于金銮参加杭州市委召开的工业会议，听到许多兄弟厂开展增产节约运动的经验，开始感到自己头上戴的“亏损帽子”是一种压力。回厂后在贯彻会议精神时，工人群众又对厂里存在的浪费现象和干部作风提了不少意见，使工厂领导干部更有所触动。
    一九六四年初，大庆精神这把革命的火烧到了富春江冶炼厂。工厂领导干部再也坐不住了。他们向全厂职工传达了大庆的经验，群众的情绪就象富春江的江水，浪涛滚滚。大家立志摘掉亏损帽子，要“把它丢到富春江去”。职工们的决心书、保证书，在几天之内贴满了车间、宿舍、食堂的墙壁，要求工厂党委马上挥动大旗，领导大伙闹革命，摘掉亏损帽子。
    职工们的革命决心，使工厂领导干部受到很大教育。党委一连开了好多次会议，认为要领导职工群众革企业落后的命，首先要革思想落后的命，特别是要领导干部带头自我革命。八个党委委员在党委会上对新旧社会的生活进行了回忆对比，进行自我阶级教育。他们中间的多数人，检查了自己“革命到顶”甘居中游的思想，有的人沉痛地检查自己几年来有了当“官”的思想，习惯于蹲在办公室里，靠听汇报了解情况，指挥生产，抛掉了过去深入实际、联系群众的好传统。原来埋怨上级帮助少的人，现在也认识到不是上级帮助不够，而是在自己这里，毛泽东思想的红旗举得不高。经过回忆对比，党委的成员立志学好用好毛主席著作，与全厂职工一道，学大庆人，走大庆路。
    从只为教育别人变为首先改造自己
    过去，领导干部学习毛主席著作，目的是不明确的。他们认为，学是为了用来教育工人的。学大庆以后，他们明确了学习毛主席著作首先应该用来改造自己。党委书记伊方安带头学毛主席著作改造自己的思想，决心象大庆干部那样，做一个为人民服务的“老黄牛”。有一位副厂长，过去和群众的关系不大好，长期以来他把这个矛盾的原因归咎于“群众落后”。越是这样想，单纯批评下面的时候就越多，他同群众的关系也就越紧张。学了毛主席的著作后，他认识到这个矛盾的主要方面是在自己，而不在群众，自己同群众关系不好，不是因为群众落后，而是因为自己缺乏全心全意为人民服务的思想，缺乏群众观点。检查出自己身上的缺点以后，他就一改过去说得多、做得少，批评下面多、检查自己少的思想作风，用自我批评的精神，用模范的行动，去改善同群众的关系。结果，关系融洽了，他的工作也比以前得心应手了。
    工厂党委所有的委员都是这样带头学、带头用毛主席著作的。他们在布置、汇报、检查、总结工作的时候，都首先布置、汇报、检查、总结学习毛主席著作的情况。任务再紧，也要保证学习不被挤掉。领导干部外出开会，下班组蹲点劳动，也都随身带着毛主席的书。五十多岁的厂长于金銮，一有空就带着老花眼镜学。许多青年工人感动地说：“厂长这么大年纪，学习毛主席著作还抓得这么紧，我们要当好革命接班人，更要用心学好毛主席著作。”
    用毛泽东思想造就一支革命化队伍
    富春江冶炼厂的领导干部不仅要求自己学好用好毛主席著作，也把用毛泽东思想武装职工群众、促进职工队伍的思想革命化放在企业一切工作的首位。他们在职工群众中反复讲解学习毛主席著作的意义，树立活学活用毛主席著作的典型，广泛交流学习毛主席著作的经验。他们还组织工人参观阶级教育展览会和听老工人作今昔对比的报告，引导职工带着阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作。因此，在全厂形成了读毛主席书、听毛主席话的新风气。《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》等文章，许多人都已读了十几遍、几十遍。工人们深有体会地说，“毛主席著作要天天学，今天学有今天的好处，明天学有明天的好处，多学多进步。”很多工人以毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地检查自己过去做工主要是为了“养家糊口”等错误思想，懂得了为革命而做工的道理，革命精神大大发扬。
    在毛泽东思想的哺育下，落后的工人变先进了，先进的工人更先进了，新人新事大量涌现。
    矿山运输工人娄金宝，过去是捏铁耙的农民，进厂后干的还是捏铁耙的活。他认为没出息，工作不安心。学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《为人民服务》等文章后，他提高了阶级觉悟，认识到捏铁耙也是革命工作，不管风里雨里，遇事总是跑在前头。这个过去“百不管”的工人，现在变成“样样管”的先进生产者了。
    五好矿工赵老虎，把毛主席著作当作指路明灯，有空就学，不懂就问，学了就用。在一次台风暴雨的袭击中，他奋不顾身，带头抢救仓库里的物资。
    浙江省先进生产者张永仁，学了毛主席著作，念念不忘勤俭建国。他建议工厂从旧厂址取回了二十多吨有回炉价值的炉渣，为国家增加了一万多元财富。
    优秀仓库保管员俞吉奎，带着阶级感情学习毛主席著作，立志做个社会主义的新愚公。他苦练出了一身过硬本领，能在黑夜里从他保管的两千多种物品中迅速、准确地拿出其中任何一件。
    化验员祁斯孝，学习《纪念白求恩》后，决心做个毫不利己的人。他在一次去矿区取回样品的途中，遇到了倾盆大雨，毫不迟疑地把身体扑在四十多袋样品上，使样品免受损失。
    现在，在富春江冶炼厂，大家关心政治，大家做思想政治工作，不仅领导做职工的思想工作，职工也做领导的思想工作。过去分工专管政治工作的党委委员，一个月有好几十个人找上门来，要他帮助解决问题，往往不能完全解决。现在，哪里有问题，哪里就有人做思想政治工作，基本上做到了问题不出班组，矛盾不上交。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的队伍，就能高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，奋发图强，排除万难，进行创造性的劳动。富春江冶炼厂领导干部，及时把职工们这种革命积极性引导到生产关键上去，集中力量打歼灭战。在扭转企业长期亏损局面这一“仗”中，职工们在时间紧、劳力不足的困难条件下，提前一个月完成了反射炉的抢修任务，紧接着进行了“三月大会战”。结果，这一个月的产量和劳动生产率大大提高，产品质量好，生产成本低，第一次盈利四百四十一元。这个数字虽然很小，但是破除了“办小型冶炼企业非亏本不可”的迷信，大大解放了职工们的思想，鼓舞着他们去夺取更大的胜利，终于在学大庆的当年由亏损变盈余，摘掉了企业亏损的帽子。
    从不相信群众变为全心全意依靠群众
    富春江冶炼厂的领导干部认识到，一支好的职工队伍，是靠好的领导干部带出来的。而领导干部要有过得硬的好作风，跟职工群众保持最广泛、最经常、最密切的联系，必须象普通劳动者那样参加劳动，真干、实干。工厂党委书记伊方安是参加劳动最过得硬的一个干部。他从大庆学习参观回来后，第一个搬到工人宿舍去住，到最艰苦的岗位，拣最脏、最重的活干。他赤膊背石头，手脚都磨起了泡，背脊晒得油黑，从不叫苦。工人们说他活象个人民的“老黄牛”。
    全厂干部在领导干部的带动下，也纷纷下去参加劳动。哪里最困难，哪里是关键，他们就到哪里干。严冬飞雪，矿山最冷，有干部在那里和工人一起推矿车；三伏酷暑，炉前最热，有干部们在那里和工人一起搞冶炼。各主要工种，不论日班、夜班，都有干部在那里顶班劳动。他们逐步从外行变成了内行，做到既是一个普通劳动者，又是一个好的领导者。过去两年，全厂干部平均每人每月有三分之一的时间参加劳动。
    干部通过参加劳动，和工人建立了深厚的阶级感情，更加关怀工人的劳动状况。冶炼车间的烧结工序；是全厂劳动条件最差的地方，温度高，硫气重，灰尘多，费力大。过去，干部不大到这里参加劳动，对工人的疾苦没有体会，因此，当烧结块的生产跟不上生产需要时，厂长批评车间主任，车间主任埋怨工段长，工段长就责怪工人。工厂党委和有关科室的干部在这里顶班劳动后，亲身体会到操作中的劳累，把改善这里的劳动条件看作是一个关系阶级观点、群众观点、生产观点的大问题。经过反复试验，成功地用机器制团的新工艺代替了原来的落后办法，大大改善了劳动条件，节约了三分之二的劳动力，降低了成本，产量也成倍增长了。
    过去，领导干部对工人群众有着无穷的智慧和伟大的创造力这一点认识不足，他们总是相信自己多，相信群众少。因此订了不少束缚工人群众创造性的“关卡”。例如，机修车间锻工汪水大多次建议把手打榔头改成机械锻打，一直没有得到领导上的支持。技术部门要他拿出设计草图，工厂领导干部也怕他花了钱，搞不成。就这样，这项革新建议一直搁浅了五年之久。学大庆后，工厂领导干部树立了全心全意依靠工人阶级办企业的思想，废除了不合理的规章制度，鼓励职工大胆创新。领导干部带头发扬民主，遇事同工人群众商量。这就把职工群众当家作主的积极性最大限度地调动起来了，全厂上下，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，技术革新的花朵到处盛开。笨重的手打榔头，不到一个月就改革成机械锻打了。从烟尘中回收精矿粉和其它副产品的淋洗塔、收尘设备，浇铸金属半成品的平板车等一共有几十项重大革新项目，一项接一项地获得成功。这些革新项目投资少，建设快，收效大，在生产上应用后，收到了多快好省的效果。×××
    富春江冶炼厂的领导干部在回顾过去走过的道路时，深深体会到，要办好社会主义企业，必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，时时突出政治，紧紧依靠工人群众，不断革命，不断前进。今年以来，他们本着打了胜仗找缺点的精神，进一步检查了企业管理工作中的薄弱环节。他们决心更加突出政治，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，充分发扬人的因素，把群众高涨的革命热情组织和落实到具体的生产岗位上来，开展增产节约运动和比学赶帮超运动，夺取新的胜利。
