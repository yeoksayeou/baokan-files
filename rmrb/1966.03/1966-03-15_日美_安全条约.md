    The notorious U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was signed on September 8, 1951, the same day as the signing of the illegal San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan. Its purpose was to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, to enable U.S. imperialism to permanently use its military bases in Japan, and to maintain a strong U.S. military presence in Japan in order to suppress the Japanese people's revolutionary movement and carry out aggressive activities in Asia.
    In order to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, under the guise of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," signed the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" on January 19, 1960. The new treaty stipulates that, with U.S. support, Japan will rearm indefinitely and engage in nuclear armament; Japan has the obligation to protect U.S. troops stationed in Japan and will send troops abroad to act as accomplices of U.S. aggressors; the United States continues to have the right to station troops in Japan and use military bases; and the economic plunder of Southeast Asia and other regions by U.S. and Japanese monopoly capital will be strengthened. This treaty further strengthens the semi-military occupation of Japan by U.S. imperialism, binds Japan to the U.S. war chariot of aggression, and seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world.

    日美“安全条约”
    臭名远扬的日美“安全条约”，是一九五一年九月八日在签订非法的旧金山对日“和约”的同一天签订的。它的目的在于加速复活日本军国主义，使美帝国主义永久使用它在日本的军事基地，维持一支强大的驻日美军，以便镇压日本人民的革命运动和在亚洲进行侵略活动。
    为了进一步加强美日军事同盟，日美反动派又以修改日美“安全条约”为名，于一九六○年一月十九日签订了“日美共同合作和安全条约”。新条约规定：在美国支持下日本无限度地重整军备并进行核武装；日本有义务保护驻日美军，并将派兵出国，充当美国侵略者的帮凶；美国继续有权在日本驻军和使用军事基地；加强美日垄断资本对东南亚和其它地区的经济掠夺。这一条约进一步加强美帝国主义对日本的半军事占领，把日本绑在美国侵略战争的战车上，严重威胁亚洲和世界和平。（伟）
