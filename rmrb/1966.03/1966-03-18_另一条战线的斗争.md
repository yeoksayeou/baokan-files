    Today, in South Vietnam, there is a powerful liberation armed force, and also a powerful political struggle force of the people. They are closely integrated, weaving a vast ocean that will drown the enemy.
    The deepest source of the power of war lies in the people. The powerful force demonstrated by the South Vietnamese people's struggle on the military and political fronts proves this point. The political struggle teams composed of tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in South Vietnam are powerful and full of fighting spirit. They heroically go to enemy-occupied cities or enemy strongholds to fight the enemy face-to-face. Because they are united, organized, dare to fight, and are good at fighting; because justice and truth are on their side, even though they are empty-handed, they can fight the US-puppet troops who are armed with modern weapons in a state of disarray and helplessness. This extraordinary political struggle of the South Vietnamese people severely strikes and disintegrates the enemy, and powerfully coordinates with the military struggle of the people's armed forces.
    The vigorous development of the South Vietnamese people's political struggle powerfully shows that no matter whether it is the "strategic hamlet" plan that has already failed in South Vietnam by US imperialism, or the so-called "social reform" new tricks that are destined to fail, they cannot stop the South Vietnamese people's struggle. On the contrary, it can only deepen their hatred for the American aggressors and strengthen their determination to fight for liberation.

    另一条战线的斗争
    今天，在越南南方，有了一支强大的解放武装力量，还有一支强大的人民群众的政治斗争队伍，它们紧密地结合在一起，交织成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海。
    战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。南越人民在军事和政治两条战线上的斗争显示的强大威力，证明了这一点。南越成千成万的各阶层人民组成的政治斗争队伍，声势浩大，斗志昂扬。他们英勇地开到敌占区城市或敌人据点去，同敌人进行面对面的斗争。由于他们团结起来，组织起来，敢于斗争，善于斗争；由于正义和真理是属于他们这一边的，因此，虽然他们赤手空拳，却能把手持现代化武器的美伪军斗得狼狈不堪，束手无策。南越人民这种力量非凡的政治斗争，沉重地打击和瓦解敌人，有力地配合了人民武装的军事斗争。
    南越人民政治斗争的蓬勃发展有力地说明，不论美帝国主义在南越已经破了产的“战略村”计划也好，还是它注定要失败的所谓“社会改革”的新花招也好，都不能阻挡南越人民的斗争，相反地，只能加深他们对美国侵略者的仇恨，加强他们争取解放的决心。
