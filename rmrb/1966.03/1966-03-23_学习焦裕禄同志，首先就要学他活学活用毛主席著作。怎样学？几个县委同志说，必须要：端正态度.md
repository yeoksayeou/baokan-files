    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, first we must learn how he creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. How should we learn? Several county committee comrades said that it is essential to:
    Correct Attitude
    In the past, I also studied Chairman Mao's works, but I did not learn well. The reason was the presence of an "I" within. If the work was done well, the higher-ups praised it, and the masses were satisfied, I would consider it "my" achievement in work. If the work was not done well and I received criticism, I would think it was because "I" didn't do the work well. Because of the "I," when I achieved certain successes in my work, I became complacent, smug, and arrogant; when shortcomings occurred in my work, I often felt resentful.
    When examining problems in my work, I focused more on examining work methods and style, and did not examine the root of my thinking by looking at the essence through the phenomena. Therefore, even after examination, I would relapse into old habits and fail to completely correct myself. When giving guidance to cadres, it was still to educate others, while neglecting my own ideological transformation. From now on, I will definitely be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and make great efforts in the "application" aspect, especially in transforming my own thinking.
    Only by transforming our own thinking and establishing a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people can we do our work well.

    学习焦裕禄同志，首先就要学他活学活用毛主席著作。怎样学？几个县委同志说，必须要：
    端正态度
    我过去也学习毛主席著作，但没有学好。原因是里边有个“我”字。把工作搞好，上级表扬，群众满意，就认为是“我”工作有成绩。若是工作搞不好受批评，又认为是“我”工作没搞好。因为有“我”字，当工作中取得一定成绩时，就沾沾自喜，骄傲自满；当工作中发生缺点时，又往往产生怨气。
    在检查工作中的问题时，只是在工作方法上、作风上检查的多，而没有通过现象看本质，检查自己的思想根源。因此检查过了，老毛病又犯了，不能彻底改正。给干部做点辅导，也还是为了教育别人，而忽视了自己的思想改造。今后一定象焦裕禄同志那样，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，特别是在改造自己思想上狠下功夫。
    只有把自己思想改造好了，树立起全心全意、完全彻底地为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，才能把工作做好。
