    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 1st: Hanoi newspapers today published the joint communiqué issued by the Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation and the Japanese Communist Party Delegation regarding the friendly visit of the Japanese Communist Party Delegation to Vietnam. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

    At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Japanese Communist Party Delegation, headed by Comrade Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Central Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party, paid a friendly visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from February 17th to 27th, 1966.

    During its visit to Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh received the delegation and held cordial talks.

    The delegation paid a friendly visit to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and also held intimate meetings with the delegation of combat heroes and combat models of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, who were visiting North Vietnam.

    The delegation visited the Vietnam Revolution Museum; met with workers of the "March 8th" Textile Factory, who were actively implementing the national plan and preparing for combat by launching competitions; and also visited the people of Thanh Hoa Province, who were actively producing and fighting bravely for the cause of resisting America and saving the nation.

    The delegation participated in a grand rally of the people of the capital city of Hanoi, solemnly held by the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party to welcome the delegation.

    During the above-mentioned meetings and visits, the Japanese Communist Party Delegation was always received with great cordiality and enthusiasm. This reception fully embodies the deep friendship and militant solidarity of the Vietnamese working class and the Vietnamese people towards the Japanese working class and the Japanese people.

    During the visit of the Japanese Communist Party Delegation to Vietnam, the Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation and the Japanese Communist Party Delegation held talks in an intimate atmosphere. The two sides briefed each other on the situation in Vietnam, the situation in Japan, and the revolutionary struggles of the two peoples, and exchanged views on other issues of common concern to the two parties.

    Participating in the talks:

    On the Vietnamese side:

    Le Duan, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party; Truong Chinh, Member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee; Le Duc Tho, Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee; Nguyen Duy Trinh, Member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee; Nguyen Van Tran, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee; Tran Quang Huy, Alternate Member of the Party Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda and Education Committee; Hoang Tung, Alternate Member of the Party Central Committee and Editor-in-Chief of the Party Central Committee's newspaper *Nhan Dan*; Tran Chi Hien, Deputy Director of the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Party Central Committee.

    On the Japanese side:

    Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Central Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party; Masayoshi Oka, Standing Committee Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee and Editor-in-Chief of *Akahata*; Korehito Kurahara, Member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and Minister of the Cultural Department of the Party Central Committee; Akira Yonehara, Member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and Editor-in-Chief of the theoretical journal *Zenei*; Kazuyoshi Sunama, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee; Koichiro Ueda, Alternate Member of the Party Central Committee; Tetsuzo Fuwa, Alternate Member of the Party Central Committee; Akira Kudo, Alternate Member of the Party Central Committee and Editor-in-Chief of the magazine *Parliament and Local Government*.

    Both sides sternly condemned the US imperialism for blatantly violating the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue, launching a war of aggression against South Vietnam, and carrying out unjust and illegal bombing raids against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Disregarding the opposition of the people of the world and the people of the United States, US imperialism has dispatched more than 200,000 American and puppet troops to South Vietnam, massively using various modern instruments of war, various poisonous gases and poisons, implementing a "kill all, burn all, destroy all" policy, and massacring innocent people in South Vietnam on a large scale. At the same time, it has also frantically bombed and strafed schools, hospitals, temples, churches, dams, and densely populated areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The US imperialist aggression against Vietnam is a monstrous crime against the national liberation movement, an intolerable infringement upon a socialist country, and an extremely arrogant provocation against the peace-loving and just people of the world. It seriously threatens the peace and security of the peoples of all countries.

    Both sides strongly condemned the deceptive nature of US President Johnson's so-called "unconditional negotiations," pointing out that this is merely to cover up the US imperialist plot to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    Both sides resolutely exposed the Sato government's policy of following and cooperating with US imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Both sides strongly condemned the collusion between US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital to revive Japanese militarism, turning Japan into an important base for US imperialism to carry out aggression and war in Asia, especially making Japan serve the US war of aggression against Vietnam. Both sides agreed that the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" is actually a step towards establishing a military alliance of aggression in Northeast Asia with the United States as its core. Both sides sternly condemned US imperialism for bringing nuclear submarines into Japan. Both sides affirmed that the Japanese people's demand for the removal of all US imperialist military bases in Japan and the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan will make an important contribution to peace in Asia and the independence of Japan.

    Both sides agreed that at present, it is a very important and urgent task to form and expand a united front of the people of the world against US imperialism and for world peace and national independence. The Vietnamese Labor Party and the Japanese Communist Party will do their utmost to make a positive contribution to the realization of this task.

    The Japanese Communist Party Delegation believes that the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation is not only for their own interests but also for the common interests of the entire socialist camp and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world. The Japanese Communist Party Delegation thoroughly supports the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, fully supports the four-point proposition of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and fully supports the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on March 22, 1965. The Japanese Communist Party Delegation fully supports President Ho Chi Minh's letter to the heads of state of various countries on January 24, 1966.

    The Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation clearly stated that the Vietnamese people fully support the heroic and tenacious struggle of the Japanese people against the rule, oppression, and exploitation of US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, and for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and improvement of living standards. The Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation warmly welcomes the great victories achieved by the Japanese people in the current revolutionary struggle under the leadership of their strong and wise vanguard, the Japanese Communist Party. These victories are also the victories of the Vietnamese people.

    The Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation sincerely thanked the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese working people, and all democratic and progressive forces for their enthusiastic and powerful support to the cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation.

    The Japanese Communist Party Delegation sincerely thanked the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese people for their consistent and warm support for the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace.

    The delegations of the two parties firmly believe that the deep friendship and militant solidarity between the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese working class, and the Vietnamese people, and the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese working class, and the Japanese people will be increasingly consolidated and developed, making contributions to vigorously promoting the common struggle against US imperialism, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and striving for the victory of world peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

    越南劳动党代表团和日共代表团发表联合公报
    谴责美国用和谈骗局掩盖扩大侵越战争  抨击佐藤政府为美帝侵略越南战争服务
    新华社河内一日电　河内各报今天刊载了越南劳动党代表团和日本共产党代表团就日本共产党代表团在越南进行友好访问发表的联合公报。公报全文如下：
    应越南劳动党中央委员会的邀请，以日本共产党中央委员会总书记、中央政治局常务委员宫本显治同志为首的日本共产党代表团，于一九六六年二月十七日到二十七日，对越南民主共和国进行了友好访问。
    在访问越南期间，胡志明主席接见了代表团，并且进行了亲切的谈话。
    代表团友好地访问了越南祖国战线中央委员会，还同正在越南北方访问的越南南方解放武装力量的战斗英雄和战斗模范代表团举行了亲密的会见。
    代表团参观了越南革命博物馆；同正在积极实现国家计划和准备战斗而开展竞赛的“三·八”纺织厂工人进行了会见；还访问了正在为抗美救国而积极生产和英勇战斗的清化省人民。
    代表团参加了由越南劳动党河内市委员会为欢迎代表团而隆重举行的首都河内人民的盛大集会。
    在上述会见和访问中，日本共产党代表团始终受到了十分亲切而热烈的接待。这种接待充分地体现了越南工人阶级和越南人民对日本工人阶级和日本人民的深厚友谊和战斗团结。
    在日本共产党代表团访问越南期间，越南劳动党代表团和日本共产党代表团在亲密的气氛中举行了会谈。双方互相介绍了越南形势、日本形势以及两国人民的革命斗争情况，并且就两党共同关心的其他问题交换了意见。
    参加会谈的：
    越南方面有：
    越南劳动党中央委员会第一书记黎笋，党中央政治局委员长征，党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记黎德寿，党中央政治局委员阮维桢，党中央书记处书记阮文珍，党中央候补委员、中央宣教委员会副主任陈光辉，党中央候补委员、党中央机关报《人民报》总编辑黄松，党中央对外联络委员会副主任陈志贤。
    日本方面有：
    日本共产党中央委员会总书记、中央政治局常务委员宫本显治，党中央政治局常务委员、书记处书记、《赤旗报》总编辑冈正芳，党中央政治局委员、党中央文化部部长藏原惟人，党中央政治局委员、理论刊物《前卫》总编辑米原昶，党中央书记处书记砂间一良，党中央候补委员上田耕一郎，党中央候补委员不破哲三，党中央候补委员、《议会和自治体》杂志总编辑工藤晃。
    双方严厉谴责美帝国主义明目张胆地违反一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，对越南南方发动侵略战争和对越南民主共和国进行非正义的、非法的轰炸。美帝国主义不顾世界人民和美国人民的反对，把二十多万名美军和仆从军派进越南南方，大规模地使用各种现代化的战争工具、各种毒气和毒药，实行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的政策，大规模屠杀越南南方无辜人民。同时，它还疯狂地轰炸和扫射越南民主共和国的学校、医院、寺庙、教堂、水坝和人口稠密的地区。美帝国主义对越南的侵略，是对民族解放运动犯下的滔天罪行，是对社会主义国家的一个不可容忍的侵犯，是对全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的极其蛮横的挑衅。它严重地威胁着各国人民的和平与安全。
    双方强烈谴责美国总统约翰逊所谓
  “无条件谈判”的欺骗性，指出这只是为了掩盖美帝国主义加强和扩大侵越战争的阴谋。
    双方坚决揭露了佐藤政府在侵略越南战争中追随美帝国主义，而且同它合作的政策。双方强烈谴责美帝国主义同日本垄断资本勾结起来，复活日本军国主义，把日本变成美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略和战争的重要基地，尤其是使日本为美国侵略越南的战争服务。双方一致认为，“日韩条约”实际上是建立以美国为核心的东北亚军事侵略联盟的一个步骤。双方严厉谴责美帝国主义把核潜艇开进日本。双方确认，日本人民要求撤除美帝国主义在日本的一切军事基地、要求把冲绳、小笠原群岛归还日本，将对亚洲的和平与日本的独立作出重要的贡献。
    双方一致认为，目前，组成和扩大世界人民反对美帝国主义、争取世界和平与民族独立的统一战线，是一项十分重要和迫切的任务。越南劳动党和日本共产党将竭尽自己的最大努力，为实现这一任务作出积极的贡献。
      日本共产党代表团认为，越南人民进行的抗美救国斗争不仅是为了本身的利益，而且也是为了整个社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平与自由的人民的共同利益。日本共产党代表团彻底支持越南人民的正义斗争，完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线一九六五年三月二十二日的五点声明。日本共产党代表团完全支持胡志明主席一九六六年一月二十四日给各国首脑的信。
    越南劳动党代表团明确表示，越南人民全力支持日本人民为反对美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的统治、压迫和剥削，争取独立、民主、和平、中立和改善生活而进行的英勇和顽强的斗争。越南劳动党代表团热烈欢迎日本人民在他们的坚强而英明的先锋队——日本共产党的领导下，在当前的革命斗争中所取得的巨大胜利。这些胜利也正是越南人民的胜利。
    越南劳动党代表团衷心感谢日本共产党、日本劳动人民和所有民主、进步力量对越南人民的抗美救国斗争事业所给予的热情和强有力的支持。
      日本共产党代表团衷心感谢越南劳动党和越南人民对日本人民争取独立、民主与和平的斗争所给予的一贯的热烈的支持。
    两党代表团坚信，越南劳动党、越南工人阶级、越南人民和日本共产党、日本工人阶级、日本人民之间的深厚友谊和战斗团结将日益巩固和发展，为大力促进反对美帝国主义、保卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的共同的斗争事业，为争取世界和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的胜利作出贡献。
            一九六六年二月二十七日
