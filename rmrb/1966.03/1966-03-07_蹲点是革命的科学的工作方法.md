    Staying at a Point is a Revolutionary and Scientific Working Method

    Unable to Stay and Able to Stay
    "Leaders staying at a point, gaining experience, using the point to lead the area, combining point and area" is the most scientific working method. In the past, although we wanted to do this, we often couldn't stay at the point for long, often being pulled back by routine office work. It was difficult to gain successful experience at the point, so using the point to lead the area and combining point and area was impossible. As a result, there were many general calls to action in our work and leadership was generalized.
    Why couldn't we stay? In 1963, when the whole county began to learn from Dazhai, the county party committee held a special discussion on this issue. Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," linked it to their thinking, linked it to reality, and began a revolution in ideological understanding by summarizing experiences and lessons. We realized that the main reason we couldn't earnestly persist in staying at a point in the past was that we didn't truly recognize that leading cadres staying at a point was a profound ideological revolution and a revolution in leadership style, and it was a question of whether to follow the mass line and whether to share weal and woe with the masses. If our thinking wasn't revolutionary, fearing hardship and fatigue, we couldn't stay or stay stably; or although people went down, they couldn't sit down; instead of strengthening investigation and research and using the method of dissecting a sparrow to use a point to lead an area, they were "flying all over the sky." As a result, the point didn't become a point, it was impossible to guide the area, and the work was still generalized. After some improvement in understanding, everyone deeply felt that if we wanted to push the mass movement to learn from Dazhai to a high tide, we must revolutionize our thinking, revolutionize our organs, and completely change the generalized leadership style of the past; we must go deep into the grassroots, stay down and learn from Dazhai with the masses, and create models. In this way, while the county party committee was vigorously carrying out ideological revolutionization and organ revolutionization, it took the lead in walking out of the office.
    Under the leadership of the county party committee, many county and commune leading cadres also walked out of their offices and went to the grassroots to stay at a point, becoming revolutionary doers. The county had its points, the commune had its points, and the departments had their points. The central work and departmental work were closely integrated. The county party committee cultivated twelve typical examples in 1963. After most of the county and commune leading cadres stayed at points in 1964, the number of points in the county expanded to one hundred and five. In 1965, it increased to one hundred and forty-nine. With so many points, the whole county used these key teams as banners to carry out the "one leading two, a sea of red" campaign of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. This allowed the movement to learn from Dazhai to grow from small to large, blooming throughout the county.
    Subjective Point Selection and Objective Point Selection
    The purpose of staying at a point is to lead an area. In the past, we didn't sufficiently understand this issue. Although we also advocated staying at a point, the purpose was not clear. Often, we were doing it for the sake of doing it, starting from subjective wishes to select points, and doing it in isolation. As a result, not only was it difficult to cultivate typical examples, but even if they were established, the surrounding masses were not convinced, and they could not truly play the role of using a point to lead an area. After summarizing this experience and these lessons, the county party committee realized that to cultivate typical examples, it must be combined with vigorously carrying out mass movements. Only the living typical examples that emerge in mass movements are truly persuasive. To this end, since 1963, we have always insisted on creating points in mass movements. The method is to grasp trends, grasp a bit of red, and when we discover that a brigade has advanced trends or a special skill, we convene cadres and members of surrounding brigades to visit and have discussions. If it is a good experience, we learn it; if there are shortcomings, we point them out. In this way, the advanced experience of one team is continuously enriched, developed, and improved, from one skill to several skills, from one advanced trend to several advanced trends, and it gradually becomes a typical example recognized by the surrounding brigades. Typical examples emerging in this way are living typical examples of carrying forward the Dazhai spirit and adhering to self-reliance. The leadership does not give them material "preferential treatment," and the masses are convinced.
    In the selection and establishment of points, according to past experiences and lessons, we have also paid special attention to two issues: One is to establish different typical examples in different regions. According to the natural characteristics of the county, it is divided into five different regions: hilly areas, rocky mountainous areas, high-altitude cold areas, flat arid areas, and small water areas. Each region establishes its own typical examples. In this way, carrying out the campaign of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing can be done with an object to compare with, a model to learn from, and a goal to catch up with, making it easy to learn and easy to help. The other is to pay attention to cultivating typical examples in general teams and backward teams. If we only establish typical examples in advanced teams, general teams, especially backward teams, often feel that they are too high to reach, and they lack confidence in learning and catching up. But establishing typical examples in backward teams, because the original conditions are similar, one team runs ahead and another team lags behind, has not only a great shock to the surrounding backward teams, but also a great impetus to the surrounding advanced teams. Learning from and catching up with the advanced easily forms a conscious action of the masses.
    Point Leads Area and Area Promotes Point
    Practice has proven that the point and the area are like the locomotive and the carriages. With a prominent point, an advanced area will appear. To use the point to lead the area and combine the point and the area, creating the point is the prerequisite. But if we only guard the point and ignore the work in the area, no matter how well the work at the point is done, it is difficult to form a true mass movement in the area. Therefore, we have adopted a working method of basing ourselves on the point and focusing on the area. The county party committee's requirement for each cadre staying at a point is: stay at the point steadily, run around the area diligently, do a good job at one point, and lead one piece of land. In this way, it is possible to break through one point, gain leadership experience, and use the work at the point to promote the development of work in the area. In order to closely link the point and the area, and strengthen the interaction between point leading area and area promoting point, we also carried out the "one leading two" campaign of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing in the county. Taking the one hundred and forty-nine model teams that learned from Dazhai well as the core, according to the principles of proximity, similar conditions, and voluntary combination, we adopted the "plum blossom" method of arranging points and spreading the net. Each model team helped and led two to three general teams and backward teams, establishing one hundred and forty-nine "one leading two" advanced experience promotion networks. They promoted each other and moved forward together, so that all five hundred and thirty-one brigades in the county were organized into the "one leading two" campaign.
    "One leading two" is valuable in its persistence and good in its regularity. Only by continuously carrying out helping and learning activities can advanced experiences be widely promoted and quickly transmitted. To this end, we first strengthened the ideological education of both the helping and learning parties. In advanced teams, we focused on solving the one-sided understandings such as fear of trouble, fear of loss, fear of exerting effort without reward, and fear of others surpassing oneself. We established the lofty ideal of having a foothold in our own brigade, looking towards Tiananmen Square, having the world in our hearts, and helping and leading fraternal teams for the revolution. In backward teams, we focused on solving ideological obstacles such as "skepticism" and fear of difficulties, established the concept of the primacy of human factors, established the idea of learning from and catching up with the advanced for the revolution, and established the great ambition to dare to "overtake those ahead." In particular, it is necessary to make advanced teams clear about their responsibilities and recognize the principle of "iron must be strong itself." Thus, they constantly create new methods and transmit new experiences, truly playing the role of "one leading two."
    The law of the development of things is always from imbalance to relative balance, and then from relative balance to new imbalance. Therefore, while carrying out "one leading two," we also grasped "two promoting one," that is, consciously organizing backward units to catch up with the advanced. The approach is: using the viewpoint of one dividing into two, while helping them find gaps, we greatly praise their achievements and inspire them to establish lofty ambitions. Help them thoroughly understand both ends: one end is the advanced experience of the point, and the other end is the reason for their own backwardness, and then prescribe the right medicine. When the backward teams have made obvious progress, we promptly use the unique advantages of the backward units to promote the advanced teams, and promote the advanced units to "rehearse new plays." In this way, the backward teams learn the multiple highlights of the advanced units, and the advanced teams learn the one highlight of the backward units, and there appeared a lively and vigorous leap forward situation of "one leading two," "two promoting one," one point leading one area, multiple points leading the whole county, advanced teams soaring upward, general teams not yielding an inch, and backward teams catching up from behind.
    Transforming the Objective World and Transforming the Subjective World
    Whether or not we can earnestly persist in the leadership method of staying at a point and leading an area is actually a process of struggle between the new and the old, the correct and the wrong, and the proletarian ideology and the bourgeois ideology.
    To popularize the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai from point to area within the scope of a county, the key is to earnestly persist in leaders staying at a point and earnestly strengthening the leadership of "one leading two." The county party committee included this issue in its important agenda, studied it regularly, checked it continuously, and summed it up earnestly. When there was experience, it was promoted promptly; when there were problems, they were solved immediately. The whole county started with vigorously carrying out organ revolutionization and ideological revolutionization of workers and cadres, selecting and transferring two hundred and nine backbone members with high ideological awareness, firm stances, familiarity with rural work, and a certain level of leadership from the county and commune levels, such as heads of county-level sections and bureaus and members of the commune party committee or above, to go deep into the front line of production, both staying at a point and taking care of the area, and specifically organizing mass movements to compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass.
    After the cadres staying at a point went to the countryside, the county party committee attached great importance to their training and improvement, holding collective training twice a year, conducting "small rectification" to improve thinking and exchange experiences. It also stipulated eight rules of conduct for staying at a point, including taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and constantly revolutionizing one's own thinking; cultivating and improving grassroots cadres, being a good adviser to grassroots cadres, and not taking over everything; highlighting politics and strengthening lively ideological work among cadres and the masses; resolutely relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, and adhering to the "three togethers," etc. In order to strengthen the masses' supervision of the cadres staying at a point, the grassroots party branch conducted an appraisal every quarter. Doing so promoted the cadres staying at a point to both transform the objective world and transform the subjective world. Seventy-two of the one hundred and forty-nine "one leading two" advanced experience promotion networks in the county have become county-wide red networks, and sixty-eight model cadres staying at a point have emerged.
    Although we have achieved some success in leading the movement to learn from Dazhai using the method of staying at a point and leading an area, compared with advanced fraternal counties, there are still many gaps. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and with the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution, earnestly persist in the method of combining point and area, and push the movement to learn from Dazhai to a new high tide.

    蹲点是革命的科学的工作方法
    山西盂县县委书记　梁和义　县委常委　高承治
    蹲不住和蹲得住
    “领导蹲点，取得经验，以点带面，点面结合”，这是最科学的工作方法。过去，我们虽然也想这样做，但是蹲点老蹲不住，往往蹲不多久，就会被机关事务性的工作拉回来。点上难以取到成功的经验，以点带面，点面结合也就无从谈起。因之，工作中一般号召多，领导一般化。
    为什么蹲不下去？在一九六三年全县开始学大寨时，县委专题讨论了这个问题。大家反复学习了毛主席《关于领导方法的若干问题》一文，联系思想，联系实际，从总结经验教训入手，在思想认识上进行革命。我们认识到：过去不能认真坚持蹲点，最主要的是没有真正认识领导干部蹲点是一场深刻的思想革命和领导作风革命，是走不走群众路线、能不能和群众同甘共苦的问题。思想不革命，怕苦怕累，下去就蹲不住、蹲不稳；或者是人虽下去了，但坐不下来；不是加强调查研究，用解剖麻雀的方法，以点带面，而是“满天飞”。结果点不成为点，无法指导面，工作仍是一般化。认识有所提高之后，大家深深感到，要想把学大寨的群众运动推向高潮，必须思想革命化，机关革命化，彻底改变过去的一般化的领导作风；必须深入基层，蹲下来和群众一起学大寨，搞样板。这样，县委在大搞思想革命化和机关革命化的同时，首先带头走出办公室。
    在县委的带动下，许多县社领导干部也纷纷走出办公室，到基层去蹲点，当革命的实干家。县有县的点，社有社的点，部门有部门的点。中心工作和部门工作紧密结合了起来。县委在一九六三年培养了十二个典型。一九六四年县社领导干部大部分蹲点后，全县的点扩大到一百零五个，一九六五年又增加到一百四十九个。有了这样多的点，全县就以这些重点队为旗帜，开展了“一带二、一片红”的比学赶帮超运动。使得学大寨运动由小到大，全县开花。
    主观定点和客观选点
    蹲点的目的是为了带面。过去我们对这个问题认识不足，虽然也提倡蹲点，但目的不明确，往往是为搞点而搞点，从主观愿望出发定点，孤立地搞点。结果不仅是典型培养起来很费力，一下树立不起来，就是树立起来了，周围群众也不心服口服，不能真正起到以点带面的作用。县委总结了这个经验教训以后，认识到：要培养典型，就必须和大搞群众运动相结合。只有在群众运动中涌现出的活典型，才是真正具有说服力的。为此，我们从一九六三年以来，始终坚持了在群众运动中搞点。方法是抓苗头，抓一点红，发现那个大队有先进苗头，有一技之长，就召集周围大队的干部和社员进行参观、座谈。是好经验就学，有缺点就提。这样，一个队的先进经验不断得到充实、发展和提高，由一技之长到几技之长，由一个先进苗头到几个先进苗头，就逐渐成为周围大队所公认的典型了。这样涌现出来的典型，是发扬大寨精神、坚持自力更生的活典型，领导上不给吃物质上的“偏饭”，群众就没有不信服的。
    在选点树点中，我们根据过去的经验教训，还特别注意了两个问题：一个是在不同地区树立不同的典型。按照全县自然特点，划为丘陵区、土石山区、高寒区、平旱区、小水区等五种不同地区，各树自己的典型，这样，开展比学赶帮超，就能做到比有对象，学有样板，赶有目标，学的好学，帮的好帮。另一个是注意了在一般队和后进队中培养典型。如果光在先进队树立典型，一般队特别是后进队往往有高不可攀之感，学赶信心不足。而在后进队树起典型，因为原来的条件相差不多，甲队跑前，乙队落后，不仅对周围的后进队震动很大，而且对周围的先进队，也有很大的推动，学赶先进就容易形成群众自觉的行动。
    点带面和面促点
    实践证明，点与面好比火车头与车厢的关系，有了突出的点，就会出现先进的面。以点带面，点面结合，创造点是前提。但是只守住这个点，忽视面上的工作，点上的工作做得再好，面上的工作也难以形成真正的群众运动。因此，我们采取了立足于点，着眼于面的工作方法。县委对每个蹲点干部的要求是：要在点上蹲得住，面上跑得勤，搞好一个点，带好一个片。这样，就能够突破一点，取得领导经验，又能够以点上工作促进面上工作的发展。为了使点面紧紧挂钩，加强点带面，面促点的相互作用，我们又在全县开展了以“一带二”为中心的比学赶帮超运动。以学大寨好的一百四十九个标兵队为核心，按地区相近，条件相同，自愿结合等原则，采取“梅花式”的布点撒网方法，每个标兵队帮带二至三个一般队和后进队，共建立了一百四十九个“一带二”先进经验推广网。互相促进，共同前进。使全县五百三十一个大队全部都组织到“一带二”运动中来。
    “一带二”，贵在坚持，好在经常。只有不断开展帮学活动，才能使先进经验推得广，传得快。为此，我们首先加强对帮学双方的思想教育工作。在先进队，是着重解决怕麻烦、怕吃亏、怕出力不讨好、怕别人超过自己等片面认识。树立脚踏本大队，眼望天安门，胸怀全世界，为革命而帮带兄弟队的远大理想。在后进队，是着重解决“怀疑论”和畏难情绪等思想障碍，树立人的因素第一的观念，树立为革命而学赶先进的思想，树立敢于“后来者居上”的雄心大志。特别是要使先进队明确自己的责任，认识“打铁先得本身硬”的道理。从而不断地创造新办法、传出新经验，真正发挥“一带二”的作用。
    事物的发展规律，总是由不平衡到相对的平衡，再由相对的平衡到新的不平衡。因此，我们在开展“一带二”的同时，又抓了“二促一”，就是有意识地组织后进单位赶超先进。做法是：用一分为二的观点，在帮助他们找差距的同时，大大表扬他们的成绩，启发他们树立雄心壮志。帮助他们吃透两头：一头是点上的先进经验，一头是自己落后的原因，然后对症下药。当后进队有了明显的进步后，就及时运用后进单位的独到之处来促进先进队，促进先进单位“排新戏”。这样，后进队学习先进单位的多点红，先进队学习后进单位的一点红，就出现了“一带二”、“二促一”、一点带一片，多点带全县，先进队扶摇直上，一般队寸步不让，后进队迎头赶上的生动活泼的跃进局面。
    改造客观世界和改造主观世界
    能不能认真坚持蹲点带面的领导方法，这实际上是新与旧、正确与错误、无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想斗争的过程。
    要在一个县的范围内由点到面普及大寨的革命精神，关键就是认真坚持领导蹲点，切实加强对
  “一带二”的领导。县委把这个问题列入了重要议事日程，定期研究，不断检查，认真总结，有经验及时推广，有问题立即解决。全县从大搞机关革命化和职工干部思想革命化入手，从县、社两级选拔抽调了二百零九名思想觉悟高、立场坚定、熟悉农村工作、有一定领导水平的县级科局长和公社党委委员以上的骨干，深入生产第一线，既蹲点，又照顾面，具体组织比学赶帮超的群众运动。
    蹲点干部到农村后，县委十分重视对他们的培养提高，每年集训两次，进行“小整风”，提高思想，交流经验。并且规定了蹲点的八项守则，其中包括带头活学活用毛主席著作，不断革自己思想的命；培养提高基层干部，给基层干部当好参谋，不包办代替；突出政治，在干部群众中加强活的思想工作；坚决依靠贫下中农，坚持三同等。为了加强群众对蹲点干部的监督，每季由基层党支部进行一次鉴定。这样做，就促使蹲点干部既改造客观世界，又改造主观世界。全县一百四十九个“一带二”先进经验推广网，有七十二个搞成了全网红，涌现出六十八名模范蹲点干部。
    我们在用蹲点带面的方法领导学大寨运动中，虽然取得了一些成绩，但与先进的兄弟县比较，仍存在着不少差距。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以不断革命彻底革命的精神，认真坚持点面结合的方法，把学大寨运动推向新的高潮。
