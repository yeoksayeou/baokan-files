    Political Leadership First
    ——On the Struggle for Stable and High Yields in the Suburbs of Shanghai
    Great changes have taken place in the ten counties of Shanghai's suburbs over the past decade. Grain and cotton yields have doubled, the income of commune members has doubled, and people's political consciousness and production enthusiasm have soared to unprecedented heights. Where did these changes come from? What are the important experiences? The vast number of cadres in the suburbs have, from their own experience, proposed: Emphasizing politics promotes high yields.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The serious problem is the education of the peasants." In the countryside, "the basic task of political work is to constantly instill socialist ideas into the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." Over the past decade, party organizations at all levels in the Shanghai suburbs have led the vast number of peasants on a path full of struggle. Following Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, every major step forward must go through a complex class struggle and the struggle between two roads and two ideologies, achieving a victory in political and ideological struggle.
    In leading agricultural production, we must first grasp ideological work, improve people's political consciousness, and not first grasp production measures, urging cultivation and planting. The Shanghai suburban party organizations, like party organizations across the country, have constantly grasped live thoughts with the development of the objective situation, using proletarian ideology to transform the peasants' old ideas and old habits, gradually expanding their horizons from small plots, small families, and small collectives to large collectives, the whole country, and the whole world; making them understand for whom they farmed in the past and why they farm today; making them learn to correctly handle the relationship between individuals, collectives, and the state, closely linking their own fate with the collective and the revolutionary cause. In this way, the vast number of peasants are gradually cultivated into a large agricultural labor force with socialist consciousness, becoming the most active factor in the development of productive forces in the Shanghai suburbs.
    The socialist collective ownership agricultural economy is a transitional economy. This economy is full of contradictions and struggles internally. Not only are there struggles between different classes and strata, but there is also a large amount of struggle between socialist ideology and the spontaneous capitalist ideology of small production. These struggles are manifested in management policies, management systems, labor attitudes, and the relationship between individuals and collectives, etc. The development of this struggle not only determines the development speed of the collective economy, but also determines the direction of its development. The establishment of the socialist system has opened up broad paths for the development of the socialist economy. However, the change in ownership does not equal the change in ideology, and the private consciousness in people's minds will never easily disappear. If these old ideas cannot be thoroughly transformed, they will inevitably have a corrosive effect on the new economic base. Therefore, to develop the socialist agricultural economy, we must first and constantly arm the peasants' minds with socialist ideology.
    On the basis of constantly improving the political consciousness of the peasants, educating them to establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution and promoting the continuous advancement of production is another important experience in the development of agriculture in the suburbs of Shanghai. When agricultural production in the suburbs of Shanghai developed to a certain level, the peasants generally produced the idea of ​​"almost there" and "good enough". This "petty bourgeois contentment" of the small-scale peasant economy made the peasants unable to see the great potential of socialist large-scale agriculture, and they often consciously or unconsciously stopped after achieving some success. The Shanghai suburban party organizations grasped these active thoughts of the peasants, carried out socialist education, uncovered the lid of production struggle, laid out contradictions, found gaps, tapped potential, learned from advanced models both locally and elsewhere, sought ideological gaps from production gaps, promptly proposed new goals of struggle, broke the view of complacency and stagnation, and pushed production to one height after another.
    Agricultural production is a struggle between man and nature, and we must constantly understand and master the laws of nature in order to effectively transform nature. The process of the comrades in the suburbs of Shanghai striving for stable and high yields is a process of constantly using Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" to understand and transform nature. They deeply realized that in the complex agricultural production, in order to achieve the expected victory, one's own thoughts must conform to objective reality, one must dare to make revolution and be good at making revolution, strictly abide by the principle of "everything through experiment"; one must inherit and carry forward the inherent traditional experience of the peasants, and accept and master new scientific and technological knowledge; one must fully utilize existing conditions and constantly create new conditions. Only in this way can we achieve victory in transforming nature.
    Lenin said that it takes several generations to transform small peasants. The experience of the suburbs of Shanghai once again tells us that to continuously develop agricultural production, we must continuously emphasize politics, adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, adhere to the socialist direction, adhere to class struggle and the struggle between two roads, and adhere to using socialist ideology to transform small peasant ideology. This is of course a long-term struggle process. However, as long as we continue to follow this path, a peasant force with a high degree of socialist thought will grow up.
    Adhering to the socialist direction of development in the countryside, and leading the peasants to continuously make revolution in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, the key lies in the revolutionization of the county committee leadership. With a county committee armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it is possible to realize the leadership of the proletariat over the peasants, to continuously consolidate and strengthen the socialist position in the countryside, and to build a new socialist countryside.

### 首先是政治领导——评上海郊区争取农业稳产高产的斗争

    首先是政治领导
    ——评上海郊区争取农业稳产高产的斗争
    上海郊区十县，十年来发生了极大的变化。粮棉产量成倍增加，社员收入成倍增加，人们的政治觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨。这些变化从何而来？有些什么重要经验？郊区广大干部从切身体会提出：突出了政治，促进了高产。
    毛泽东同志说过，“严重的问题是教育农民。”在农村，“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”十年间，上海郊区各级党组织，领导广大农民，走过一条充满斗争的道路。按照毛泽东同志的教导，每前进一大步，都要经历一场复杂的阶级斗争和两条道路、两种思想的斗争，在政治、思想斗争中取得一次胜利。
    领导农业生产，首先要抓思想工作、提高人的政治觉悟，而不能首先抓生产措施、催耕催种。上海郊区党组织，同全国各地党组织一样，随着客观形势的发展，不断抓活思想，用无产阶级思想改造农民的旧思想、旧习惯，使他们的眼光从小块田、小家建、小集体，逐步扩展到大集体、全国、全世界；使他们了解过去为谁种田，今天为什么种田；使他们学会正确处理个人、集体、国家三者之间的关系，把自己的命运同集体、同革命事业紧密地结合在一起。这样，就把广大农民逐步培养成为一支具有社会主义觉悟的农业劳动大军，成为上海郊区生产力发展的最活跃的因素。
    社会主义的集体所有制农业经济，是一种过渡性的经济。这种经济的内部，充满着矛盾和斗争。不仅有不同阶级、阶层之间的斗争，更大量的是社会主义思想和小生产自发资本主义思想之间的斗争。这些斗争，表现在经营方针、管理制度、劳动态度以及个人和集体关系等等方面。这种斗争的发展，不仅决定着集体经济的发展速度，而且决定着集体经济的发展方向。社会主义制度的建立，为社会主义经济的发展开辟了广阔的道路。但所有制的改变，并不等于意识形态的改变，人们头脑里的私有意识决不会轻易消失。这种种旧的思想如果不能获得彻底改造，必然会对新的经济基础发生腐蚀作用。因此，要发展社会主义农业经济，必须首先地、不断地用社会主义思想武装农民的头脑。
    在不断提高农民政治觉悟的基础上，教育农民树立不断革命的思想，促进生产的不断前进，这是上海郊区发展农业的又一个重要经验。上海郊区农业生产发展到一定程度的时候，农民中普遍产生了“差不多”、“过得去”的思想。这种小农经济的“小康思想”，使得农民看不到社会主义大农业的巨大潜力，经常在得到某种成就之后，自觉地或者不自觉地停顿下来。上海郊区党组织抓住农民的这些活思想，进行社会主义教育，大揭生产斗争的盖子，摆矛盾，找差距，挖潜力，学习本地和外地的先进典型，从生产差距追寻思想差距，及时提出新的奋斗目标，打破自满停滞的观点，把生产推向一个又一个高度。
    农业生产是人对大自然的斗争，必须不断认识和掌握自然规律，才能有效地改造自然。上海郊区的同志们争取稳产高产的过程，就是不断运用毛泽东同志的《实践论》，认识自然和改造自然的过程。他们深切地体会到，在复杂的农业生产中，要想取得预期的胜利，必须使自己的思想符合客观实际，既要敢于革命，又要善于革命，严格遵守“一切经过试验”的原则；既要继承和发扬农民固有的传统经验，又要接受和掌握新的科学技术知识；既要充分运用已有条件，又要不断创造新的条件。这才能取得改造自然的胜利。
    列宁说过，改造小农需要几代的时间。上海郊区的经验再一次告诉我们，要不断发展农业生产，必须不断突出政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持社会主义方向，坚持阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，坚持用社会主义思想改造小农思想。这当然是一个长期斗争过程。但是，只要沿着这条道路走下去，具有高度社会主义思想的农民队伍就会成长起来。
    在农村坚持社会主义发展方向，领导农民在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中不断革命，关键在于县委领导的革命化。有了一个以毛泽东思想武装起来的县委会，才能实现无产阶级对农民的领导，才能不断巩固和加强农村中的社会主义阵地，建设社会主义的新农村。
