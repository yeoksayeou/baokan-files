Title: Single-Minded Focus on Business Will Not Work

    Last July, I became the group leader of the dumpling team. As soon as I started, I was busy from morning till night, focusing solely on the business aspect, and not paying attention to leading everyone in studying Chairman Mao's works. I was even unwilling to let some skilled workers study, fearing it would affect the work. For example, the cashier in our group was efficient at his job; he could collect payments and also make dumplings. He was a good hand. I just “blocked” him from studying. Coincidentally, problems kept arising with him. He would either make mistakes in collecting payments, or quarrel with customers. Once, the dumplings he made split open when cooked, and the customer criticized him. The next day, he didn't come to work. I was most afraid of wasting time, but this ended up wasting even more time.
    Through this incident, the leadership helped me study Chairman Mao's works on political and ideological work. I began to realize that focusing solely on business would not work, and we must take the road of giving prominence to politics. Afterwards, we persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works and understood that making dumplings was also a matter of doing revolution. Our sense of responsibility greatly increased, and our business work was also done well.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Wei Zhenshui's experience is very convincing. Focusing solely on business leads to more and more problems. Using politics to command business, the workers' ideological awareness improves, their sense of responsibility is strengthened, and things are done well. It can be seen that politics and business are in a commander-commanded relationship, with politics commanding business and business obeying politics.

    单抓业务行不通
  去年七月，我当了饺子组组长。一上来，从早忙到晚，一个劲地抓业务，不注意领导大家学习毛主席著作，甚至不愿意让一些熟手去学习，怕影响工作。比如组里的收款员，干活利落，既能收款，又能包饺子，是一把好手。我就“卡”着不让他学习。说也巧，偏偏在他身上不断出问题，不是收错款，就是跟顾客吵架。有一次，他包的饺子一煮露了馅，顾客提出批评，他第二天不上班了。我最怕耽误时间，这下子却耽误了更多的时间。
    通过这件事，领导上帮助我学习了毛主席有关政治思想工作的著作。我开始认识到就业务抓业务这条道走不通，必须走突出政治的路。以后，我们坚持学习毛主席著作，懂得了包饺子也是干革命的道理，责任心大大加强，业务工作也做好了。

    编者注：蔚振水同志的体会，很有说服力。就业务抓业务，越抓问题越多。用政治统帅业务，工人思想觉悟提高了，责任心加强了，事情就办好了。可见政治和业务是统帅被统帅的关系，政治统帅业务，业务服从政治。
