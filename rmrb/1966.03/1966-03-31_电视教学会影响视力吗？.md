    Television Industrial Middle School in Taiyuan uses modern television equipment for teaching. Initially, some students' parents and students were concerned that television teaching would affect their eyesight. To ensure the healthy growth of students, since the establishment of the television school, we have paid attention to the eyesight protection of students in television classes, strengthened students' eye hygiene education, and improved the teaching environment. Facts have proven that, in accordance with national health requirements, a classroom lighting coefficient of one-quarter to one-sixth (the ratio of window light-transmitting area to floor area) and good lighting do not affect television teaching.
    What is the vision situation of the students in the Television Industrial Middle School? Since 1964, we have conducted continuous eight-month dynamic observations on the vision changes of one hundred students in the Xiyangshi, Xiaoweiying, Shuangta Xijie, and Yongding Lu television classes of the Television Industrial Middle School. During the vision examination, we also investigated the teaching environment and the reasons for vision decline. The results of the survey are: In the first examination in April 1965, poor vision accounted for 26 percent, or 23 percent by eye count. The second examination in June remained basically unchanged. In the re-examination in December 1965, poor vision accounted for 25 percent, or 21 percent by eye count. From the overall observation of the four television classes over eight months, the vision of students in the television classes showed a trend of improvement.
    Judging from the development trend of students' vision, the proportion of vision improvement was larger than the proportion of continued vision decline. Vision improvement accounted for 19.5 percent, while vision decline accounted for 8 percent. The main reasons are that the Television Industrial Middle School implements a combination of study and labor, students have a lighter academic burden, more outdoor activities, appropriate arrangements for labor, and sufficient sleep time. At the same time, each television class seriously protects students' eyesight and insists on doing eye exercises, which is also greatly related.

    电视教学会影响视力吗？
    太原电视工读中学是利用现代化的电视设备进行教学的。开始，有些学生的家长和学生担心用电视教学会影响视力。为了保证学生的健康成长，从电视学校成立以来，我们就注意了对电视班学生的视力保护工作，加强了学生用眼卫生教育，改善了教学环境。事实证明，按照国家卫生要求，教室采光系数达到四分之一至六分之一（窗户透光面积与地面积之比），良好的采光对电视教学并没有影响。
    电视工读中学的学生的视力情况究竟怎样呢，从一九六四年以来，我们对电视工读中学的西羊市、校尉营、双塔西街、永定路四个电视班的一百名学生进行了连续八个月的视力变化动态观察。在视力检查的同时，并对教学环境、视力减退原因进行了调查。调查结果是：一九六五年四月第一次检查，视力差占百分之二十六，以眼数计占百分之二十三。六月第二次检查，基本未改变。一九六五年十二月复查，视力差占百分之二十五，以眼数计占百分之二十一，从四个电视班八个月总的观察情况看，电视班学生视力呈现好转趋势。
    从学生视力发展趋势看，视力好转的比视力继续减退的所占比例较大，视力好转的占百分之十九点五，视力下降的占百分之八。分析其原因，主要是由于电视工读中学实行边学习边劳动，学生课业负担较轻，户外活动较多，适当安排劳动，睡眠时间充足。同时，各电视班认真保护学生视力，坚持做眼睛保健操，也有很大关系。
