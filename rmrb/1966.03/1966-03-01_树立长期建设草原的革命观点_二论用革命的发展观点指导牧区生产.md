    Our socialist animal husbandry economy has seen significant development under the correct leadership of the Party, and will continue to develop greatly in the future. To further develop animal husbandry production, it is essential to adopt a correct viewpoint towards grasslands. Should we rely on nature, depend on the heavens for livestock, and simply utilize existing natural grasslands, or should we establish a long-term construction viewpoint, combining grassland utilization with grassland construction? This is an important issue of understanding how to emphasize politics in the development of animal husbandry production.
    Our pastoral and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas possess vast grasslands. Under the correct guidance of the pastoral area policies formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, herdsmen have done much work in grassland construction, and grassland construction has greatly developed. In recent years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has surveyed over 800 million mu of grassland, sunk over 35,000 water wells, and constructed over one million mu of fodder and feed bases. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has completed surveys and comprehensive utilization plans for over 100 million mu of grassland, built over 600 grassland water conservancy projects, pastoral roads, and bridges, and constructed thousands of small-scale water conservancy projects. Qinghai Province has eliminated harmful rodents on over 27 million mu of grassland and carried out several grassland construction projects. Other regions have similarly done much work. This situation demonstrates that the situation of simply relying on natural grasslands and “migrating with the water and grass” to raise livestock can be broken. The vast number of herdsmen in our country can make greater contributions in constructing grasslands and building new socialist pastoral areas.
    The majority of our country's grasslands are distributed in border areas inhabited by minority nationalities. Large-scale grassland construction is not only a need for developing our national economy but also an important condition for further developing the socialist economy and culture of many fraternal nationalities. It is also conducive to enhancing the unity of all nationalities in our country. This is a long-term historical task.
    How to treat grasslands and whether or not to have a long-term revolutionary viewpoint of construction is first and foremost a political issue, and whether or not to emphasize politics in the development of animal husbandry production. Grasslands are the main material foundation for developing socialist animal husbandry and building new socialist pastoral areas. In the development of animal husbandry production, if grassland construction is neglected, it will be impossible to break away from the backward state of relying on nature and depending on the heavens for livestock. It will be impossible to achieve a revolution on the production front, and it will be impossible to build a socialist animal husbandry economy. Should we rely on the heavens for livestock or rely on construction for livestock? Should we simply utilize existing natural grasslands to develop animal husbandry, or should we actively construct grasslands to develop animal husbandry? This is a fundamental dividing line between the socialist collective animal husbandry economy and the backward individual natural economy of the past. Therefore, whether or not to carry out grassland construction is essentially a question of whether or not to take the socialist animal husbandry economic road, that is, whether or not to build socialism in pastoral areas.
    Some people believe that our country's grasslands are very large, and cannot be fully utilized now, so there is no need for any construction. Others believe that grassland construction is a matter for the future, and that construction now would be of no use. This is separating the relationship between utilization and construction. These comrades do not understand that without a construction viewpoint, utilizing grasslands will lack a correct direction, and the purpose of fully utilizing grasslands cannot be achieved. Only by actively carrying out grassland construction with a revolutionary spirit can grasslands be utilized more rationally, economically, and scientifically; can the enthusiasm of the people be more fully mobilized, the socialist collective economy consolidated, and productive forces further developed. Utilizing natural resources and developing socialist production undertakings in accordance with local conditions is an issue we must pay attention to. However, no natural condition is absolute, and the size and quality of grasslands are also not absolute. Without a construction viewpoint, only utilization without construction will gradually worsen good grasslands and gradually shrink large grasslands. Conversely, with a construction viewpoint, giving full play to man's dynamic role on grasslands, bad grasslands will gradually improve, and small grasslands will gradually grow larger. Therefore, saying that grasslands are large enough that construction is unnecessary is actually failing to see the role of human factors and is a passive reflection of relying on nature and depending on the heavens for livestock. To build new socialist pastoral areas and develop a socialist animal husbandry economy, we must first overcome this passive reliance in our guiding ideology and establish a long-term revolutionary viewpoint of grassland construction.
    There are also two different understandings of what path to take and what methods to use for grassland construction. Some people, upon mentioning construction, think of spending large sums of state money or inappropriately applying foreign experience, doing things in a foreign style and on a large scale, focusing only on machinery and equipment, while failing to see the people. As a result, money is spent, but little is accomplished. Doing so is to be divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and grasslands will never be well constructed. Who should build grasslands? Primarily, it should be the broad masses of herdsmen, relying on their own hands to build through self-reliance. This is the only correct path for grassland construction. The saying that "herdsmen can only graze livestock and cannot build," or "can only work on horseback, not off horseback" is completely wrong and views the new socialist herdsmen with the old eyes of the old society. Since liberation, the laboring herdsmen of all nationalities in our country have experienced democratic reform and socialist revolution and have been organized into the socialist collective economy. Politically, they understand best the suffering of the old society and can best appreciate the sweetness of the new society. They listen most attentively to the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and have great enthusiasm for socialist construction. Culturally, they have also turned over a new leaf. Most pastoral areas have a number of educated youth who have received secondary education. It should also be noted that the laboring herdsmen who have lived on the grasslands for generations are the most familiar with grasslands and love them the most. "Grass is grain, water is oil." They cherish grasslands as their own lives, never casually digging a shovel or hoe on the grasslands, and never casually wasting a drop of water or a blade of grass. They possess boundless strength for grassland construction. As long as their enthusiasm is fully brought into play, construction methods will emerge endlessly, the strength of construction will be inexhaustible, and grassland construction will continuously move forward in accordance with local conditions.
    Some people, when they think of pastoral areas, think of vast grasslands and scattered herdsmen's households, and do not acknowledge that herdsmen can become the main force in grassland construction. This view actually fails to see the great strength of the people's communes and is also a manifestation of not believing in the broad masses of herdsmen. Today's herdsmen are revolutionary herdsmen, herdsmen armed and organized with Mao Zedong Thought. They are engaged in animal husbandry production for the sake of the revolution and are building grasslands for the sake of the revolution. As long as the herdsmen's thinking is revolutionized, they will become a huge force for grassland construction. The Wushenzhao Commune in Wushen Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has only 1,400 full and semi-laborers. In addition to managing 404 herds of livestock of all sizes, they have also carried out large-scale grassland construction. In seven years, desert control alone has reached more than 100,000 mu. In addition, they have also planted trees, built water fields, and opened up "grass gardens." Chen Guanzhu and Liu Maotong, herdsmen in Jungar Banner, have reformed and constructed thousands of mu of grassland while grazing sheep, achieving remarkable results. If millions of herdsmen are mobilized, and all work like the herdsmen of the Wushenzhao Commune, like Chen Guanzhu and Liu Maotong, working every day, every month, every year, persevering unremittingly, and combining revolutionary drive with scientific spirit, then even the largest grasslands can certainly be well constructed through long-term hard work, and the broad masses of herdsmen can fully become the main force in grassland construction.
    Grassland construction is a long-term socialist undertaking and a great production revolution that no one has ever done before. It is necessary not only to make revolution against nature but also to carry out ideological revolution. Leaders and revolutionary cadres at all levels in pastoral and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas must strive to realize the revolutionization of their own thinking in the current socialist education movement, in the class struggle and production struggle, and translate revolutionization into production, into grassland construction, establishing the revolutionary thinking and revolutionary viewpoint of relying on herdsmen, self-reliance, striving for strength, and building grasslands, promoting production struggle and grassland construction with class struggle, and gradually building our country's 4 to 5 billion mu of grassland well, laying a reliable material foundation for the development of the motherland's socialist animal husbandry economy.

### 树立长期建设草原的革命观点——二论用革命的发展观点指导牧区生产

    树立长期建设草原的革命观点
    ——二论用革命的发展观点指导牧区生产
    我国的社会主义畜牧业经济，在党的正确领导下，已经有了很大的发展，今后还要继续大大发展。为了进一步发展畜牧业生产，必须以正确的观点对待草原。是依赖自然，靠天养畜，单纯利用现有天然草原呢，还是树立长远的建设观点，利用草原和建设草原相结合呢？这是在发展畜牧业生产中怎样突出政治的一个重要的认识问题。
    我国的牧区和半农半牧区，拥有广大面积的草原。在党中央和毛泽东同志所制定的牧区方针政策的正确指导下，牧民们在草原建设上做了许多工作，草原的建设已经有了很大的发展。内蒙古自治区几年来勘查了八亿多亩草原，打了三万五千多眼水井，建设了百万多亩饲草饲料基地。新疆维吾尔自治区完成了上亿亩草原踏查和综合利用规划，修建草原水利工程、牧道、桥梁六百多项，建设了数以千计的小型水利工程。青海省在二千七百多万亩草原上消灭了害鼠，进行了多项草原建设。其他地区同样做了许多工作。这种情况表明：靠天养畜，“逐水草而居”的单纯利用天然草原的局面可以打破，我国广大牧民可以在建设草原、建设社会主义新牧区中做出更大贡献。
    我国的草原，绝大部分分布在边疆少数民族地区。大规模建设草原，既是发展我国国民经济的需要，又是许多兄弟民族进一步发展社会主义经济和文化的重要条件，也有利于增强我国各民族的团结。这是一项长时期的历史任务。
    如何对待草原，要不要有一个长期建设的革命观点，这首先是个政治问题，是在发展畜牧业生产中要不要突出政治的问题。草原是发展社会主义畜牧业、建设社会主义新牧区的主要物质基础。在发展畜牧业生产中，如果忽视了草原的建设，就不能摆脱依赖自然、靠天养畜的落后状态，就不能实现生产战线上的革命，也就不能建设社会主义的畜牧业经济。是靠天养畜，还是靠建设养畜？是单纯利用现有天然草原发展畜牧业，还是积极建设草原发展畜牧业？这是社会主义集体畜牧业经济和过去个体落后的自然经济的一个根本的分界线。因此，要不要进行草原的建设，实质上也就是要不要走社会主义畜牧业经济道路的问题，也就是要不要在牧区建设社会主义的问题。
    有人认为，我国的草原大得很，现在还利用不了，不需要进行什么建设。还有人认为，建设草原是将来的事，现在建设了也不顶用。这是把利用和建设的关系分割开了。这些同志不了解，没有建设的观点，利用草原就没有正确的方向，就不能达到充分利用草原的目的。只有以革命的精神，积极进行草原建设，才能更合理、更经济、更科学地利用草原；才能更充分地调动人民群众的积极性，巩固社会主义集体经济，进一步发展生产力。利用自然资源，因地制宜地发展社会主义生产事业，这是我们必须重视的一个问题。但是，任何自然条件都不是绝对的，草原的大与小，好与坏也都不是绝对的。没有建设的观点，只利用，不建设，这样，好草原就会逐渐变坏，大草原就会逐渐变小。相反，有了建设的观点，充分发挥人对草原的能动作用，坏草原就会逐渐变好，小草原就会逐渐变大。因此，说草原大就可以不建设，这实际上是看不到人的因素的作用，是消极地依赖自然、靠天养畜的一种思想反映。我们要建设社会主义新牧区，发展社会主义畜牧业经济，首先就要在指导思想上，克服这种消极的依赖思想，树立一个长期建设草原的革命观点。
    建设草原要走什么样的道路，要用什么样的方法，这也有两种不同的认识。有人一提建设，就想大花国家的钱，或者不适当地搬用外国的经验，办洋的，办大的，眼睛只看在机器设备上面，而看不到人，结果花了钱，办不了多少事。这样做，是脱离群众、脱离实际的，是永远不会把草原建设好的。草原靠谁来建设？主要应当靠广大的牧民，靠牧民用自己的双手，自力更生去建设。这是建设草原的唯一正确的道路。“牧民只会放牧不会建设”，“只能马上劳动，不能马下劳动”。这种说法是十分错误的，是拿旧社会的老眼光来看待社会主义的新牧民。解放以后，我国各族劳动牧民，都经历了民主改革和社会主义革命，已经组织在社会主义集体经济中。在政治上，他们最懂得旧社会的苦，也最能体会新社会的甜，他们最听共产党和毛主席的话，对社会主义建设有极大的积极性。在文化上，他们也翻了身。多数牧区都有了一批受过中等教育的知识青年。还应当看到，世世代代生活在草原上的劳动牧民，他们最熟悉草原，最热爱草原。“草是粮食，水是油”，他们爱惜草原如同自己的生命，从来不在草原上随便挖一锹一镐，不随便浪费一滴水和一根草。在他们当中，蕴藏着无限的建设草原的力量。只要充分发挥他们的积极性，建设的办法就会层出不穷，建设的力量就会无穷无尽，草原的建设就会因地制宜地不断地向前发展。
    有些人一提起牧区，就联想到辽阔的草原，零零散散的牧户，不承认牧民能够成为建设草原的主力军。这种看法，实际上没有看到人民公社的伟大力量，也是不相信广大牧民群众的一种表现。今天的牧民是革命的牧民，是用毛泽东思想武装起来和组织起来的牧民，他们为革命而从事畜牧业生产，为革命而建设草原。只要是牧民的思想革命化了，就会成为建设草原的巨大力量。内蒙古自治区乌审旗乌审召公社只有一千四百个整、半劳动力，他们除了经营四百零四群大小牲畜外，还进行了规模巨大的草原建设。七年时间，光治沙一项就达十万亩之多。另外还种了树，建设了水地，开辟了“草园”。准格尔旗牧民陈官柱、刘茂同二人，一边放羊一边种草，两个人改造和建设了几千亩草原，做出了十分出色的成绩。如果千百万牧民群众全都动员起来，都象乌审召公社牧民那样干，都象陈官柱、刘茂同那样干，天天干，月月干，年年干，坚持不懈地干，并且把革命干劲同科学精神很好地结合起来，经过长时期的艰苦努力，再大的草原也一定能够建设好，广大的牧民完全能够成为建设草原的主力军。
    建设草原是一项长期的社会主义事业，也是一项前人从未做过的生产大革命。不仅要革大自然的命，还要进行思想革命。牧区和半农半牧区的各级领导和革命干部，要在当前的社会主义教育运动中，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，努力实现自己思想的革命化，把革命化落脚到生产上，落脚到草原建设上，树立依靠牧民、自力更生、奋发图强、建设草原的革命思想和革命观点，以阶级斗争促进生产斗争，促进草原建设，逐步把我国四、五十亿亩草原建设好，为祖国社会主义畜牧业经济的发展，打下可靠的物质基础。
