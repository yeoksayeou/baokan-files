    Scientific Workers Combine with Workers and Peasants
    New Progress in China's Research and Utilization of Karst
    The Geological Society of China convened a national academic conference on karst, summarizing and exchanging experiences in karst utilization, and actively serving production and construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 13th. China has made progress in the research and utilization of karst. Recently, the Geological Society of China convened a national academic conference on karst in Guilin, Guangxi, to summarize and exchange achievements and experiences in this area. Ninety-three academic papers were presented at the conference, and it was unanimously suggested that the term "喀斯特 (Kāsītè)" be changed to "岩溶 (Yánróng)".
    Karst is a natural phenomenon resulting from the erosion of soluble rocks such as limestone by water. It is widely distributed in China with diverse types, not only creating unique landscapes such as the Seven Star Cave in Guilin and the Stone Forest in Lunan, Yunnan, for people to appreciate; but also karst areas have abundant reserves of high-quality groundwater; the minerals in karst caves, as well as limestone, dolomite, gypsum, etc. in the soluble rock, are also valuable resources. However, due to the formation and development of karst, the general rules of surface runoff are disrupted, leading to unfavorable situations such as "flooding after rain, drought after rain, reservoirs unable to hold water, and dams unable to block water," as well as "water flowing underground, crops dying in the fields," affecting the stable and high yield of agriculture in karst areas. When mining underground minerals or excavating tunnels, one often encounters attacks from karst groundwater, causing serious disasters. In the construction of farmland water conservancy, roads, bridges, and industrial and civil engineering projects, leakage, unstable foundations, and collapses are often caused by the existence of karst.
    Since liberation, especially in recent years, with the development of industrial and agricultural construction, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and scientific and technical personnel have launched effective struggles to overcome the unfavorable factors caused by karst. In karst areas such as Hunan and Guangxi, the masses have adopted simple and effective methods such as "blocking," "diverting," "storing," "blasting," and "lifting" to develop a large amount of shallow karst groundwater and have built tens of thousands of reservoirs, ponds, and groundwater projects, which have played a good role in the development of agricultural production. Hydrological and engineering geological personnel and workers in Guizhou, together, successfully built a hydropower station on a river that was considered impossible to build a station on due to the existence of karst. After several years of testing, the reservoir has not leaked, and the dam stands firm. In the struggle against karst mine water in many mines, methods such as "dewatering," "intercepting," "waterproofing," and "avoiding water" were used to save or preserve mines that foreign experts thought were impossible to mine.
    In the practice of the arduous struggle against karst, Chinese scientists and workers have accumulated rich data on karst in China, and have new understanding and development in the basic theories such as karst development. In the methods and means of understanding and studying karst, there have also been many new developments in recent years.
    With the development of research and utilization of karst, a young scientific research team for karst has also grown stronger. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Serve the People," using the dialectical materialist viewpoints of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," and with the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or fatigue, they climb cliffs, walk on precipices, explore caves, and fight in karst areas all year round. They seek underground water sources for people in water-scarce karst areas and actively participate in farmland water conservancy construction and other engineering construction, and are praised by the masses.

    我国研究利用岩溶获新进展
    中国地质学会召开全国岩溶学术会议，总结交流利用岩溶经验，积极为生产建设服务。
    新华社南宁十三日电　我国研究、利用岩溶（喀斯特）的工作取得进展。最近中国地质学会在广西桂林召开全国岩溶学术会议，总结交流了这方面的成就和经验。会上提出九十三篇学术论文，并一致建议，把“喀斯特”这一名词改称为“岩溶”。
    岩溶是水对石灰岩等可溶岩溶蚀后的一种自然现象。它在我国分布广、类型多，不仅造成形形色色的特殊景观，如桂林的七星岩、云南路南的石林等，可供人们欣赏；而且岩溶地区有储量丰富、质地优良的地下水；岩溶洞穴中的矿产以及溶岩中的石灰岩、白云岩、石膏等也是很宝贵的资源。但是，由于岩溶的形成和发展，破坏了地表径流的一般规律，出现“雨后受洪涝，雨过即干旱，修塘不盛水，建坝无水拦”以及“水在地下流，禾在田中死”的不利情况，影响了岩溶地区农业的稳产和高产。在开采地下矿产、挖掘隧道时，也往往会遇到岩溶地下水的袭击而造成严重灾害。在农田水利、道路、桥梁以及工业、民用等工程的建设中，也常常因岩溶的存在，而引起渗漏、基础不稳和塌陷等问题。
    解放以来，特别是近几年，随着工农业建设的发展，广大工农群众和科学技术人员为克服岩溶所造成的不利因素展开了有成效的斗争。湖南、广西等岩溶地区的群众，采用既简单又有成效的“堵”、“引”、“蓄”、“爆”、“提”等办法，开发了大量的浅层岩溶地下水，并兴建了成千上万的水库、山塘和地下水工程，对农业生产的发展，起了良好的作用。贵州的水文地质、工程地质人员和工人群众一起，在因存在岩溶而被人认为绝对无法建立电站的河流上，成功地建起了水电站。经过几年的考验，水库一直不漏水，大坝屹立无恙。不少矿山与岩溶的矿坑水作斗争中，用“疏干”、“截流”、“防水”、“躲水”等办法，救活或者保住了外国专家认为无法开采的矿井。
    我国科学工作者和工人群众在与岩溶作顽强斗争的实践中，积累了有关我国岩溶的丰富资料，在岩溶发育等基本理论上有了新的认识和发展。在认识和研究岩溶的方法、手段上，最近几年也有了许多新的进展。
    随着研究利用岩溶工作的发展，一支年轻的研究岩溶的科学工作队伍也成长壮大起来了。他们遵循毛主席《为人民服务》的教导，用《矛盾论》、《实践论》的辩证唯物观点，以不怕苦，不怕累的革命精神，攀悬崖，走绝壁，探洞穴，终年累月战斗在岩溶地区。他们为缺水的岩溶地区人民寻找地下水源，积极参加农田水利建设和其他工程建设，受到群众的赞扬。
