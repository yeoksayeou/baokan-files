Title: An Ill-Fitting Overcoat

    The West German government, which has consistently and actively revived militarism and openly engaged in revanchist clamoring, recently distributed a so-called "peace note" to many countries, talking at length about "comprehensive disarmament" and "guaranteeing European peace," attempting to paint a picture of West German "peace policies" to the world. This is a conspiracy by West German militarist forces to coordinate with the U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary global strategy and realize its ambitions of aggression.
    Currently, U.S. imperialism is shifting its strategic focus from Europe to Asia. Soviet revisionists are executing a policy of appeasement and retreat in Europe, greatly assisting the United States in this regard. In fact, the United States has not relaxed its aggressive deployment in Western Europe, but rather is relying more heavily on West German militarist forces. Especially since France wants to dismantle the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, West Germany's position in the U.S. imperialist global strategy has become even more important. West German militarist forces, in turn, see this as a great opportunity to make a comeback. This is the background to the Bonn government's latest diplomatic action.
    From Washington and Bonn's perspective, it is deemed necessary for the West German government to put on a "peaceful" appearance to deceive the public. This is not only conducive to the United States further reviving West German militarism, but also to the United States and the Soviet Union reaching political deals such as the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." Therefore, it would be foolish to think that the United States has changed its policy of supporting West German revanchist forces and that the situation in Europe has truly eased.
    However, isn't it rather ill-fitting for the West German government to put on such a "peaceful" overcoat? Everyone knows that the West German militarist forces, which have been revived under U.S. support, have always wanted to take the path of revanchism. Although the Bonn government's "peace note" contains many pleasant "peace" phrases, it cannot hide its fox tail. This note reiterates the West German government's consistent position: to restore the borders of Hitler's Germany in 1937, to achieve "reunification" by annexing the German Democratic Republic, and to obtain nuclear weapons through the U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Can all of this be called a "picture of peace policies"? The Bonn authorities think they are clever, but they are actually very foolish.

    不合身材的外衣
    一贯积极复活军国主义并且公开进行复仇主义叫嚣的西德政府，最近忽然向许多国家散发了一份所谓“和平照会”，大谈什么“全面裁军”、“保证欧洲和平”，要向世界描绘一幅西德“和平政策的图景”。这是西德军国主义势力为了配合美帝国主义反革命全球战略，实现它的侵略野心的一个阴谋。
    目前，美帝国主义正在把它的战略重心从欧洲移到亚洲。苏联修正主义者在欧洲执行步步退让的绥靖主义政策，在这方面给美国帮了大忙。事实上，美国并没有放松它在西欧的侵略部署，不过是要更加倚重西德军国主义势力罢了。特别是由于法国要拆散北大西洋集团，西德在美帝国主义全球战略中的地位就变得更为重要了。而西德军国主义势力，则认为这是它东山再起的大好机会。这就是波恩政府这一次采取的外交行动的背景。
    从华盛顿和波恩看来，由西德政府装出一副“和平”姿态，以掩人耳目，是大有必要的。这不仅有利于美国进一步复活西德军国主义，同时也有利于美苏之间做成所谓“防止核扩散”一类的政治交易。因此，如果以为美国已经改变扶植西德复仇主义势力的政策，欧洲的局势有了真正的缓和，那真是活见鬼。
    但是，西德政府披上这样一件“和平”外衣不是太不合身材了吗？谁都知道，在美国扶植下已经复活起来的西德军国主义势力，一直就想要走复仇主义道路。波恩政府的“和平照会”中虽然讲了许多动听的“和平”字句，但也隐藏不了它的狐狸尾巴。这个照会重申西德政府的一贯立场：要恢复一九三七年希特勒德国的边界，要实现并吞德意志民主共和国的“重新统一”，要通过美国控制的北大西洋集团取得核武器。所有这些难道就能够说是什么“和平政策的图景”吗？波恩当局自以为聪明，其实是愚蠢得很。
