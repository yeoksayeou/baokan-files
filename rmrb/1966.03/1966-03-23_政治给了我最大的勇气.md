    Politics Gave Me the Greatest Courage
    Last May, I went to Changpu Commune in Susong County to participate in rural mobile medical service. At first, I thought the rural equipment and conditions were poor. Whenever I encountered patients who needed surgery, I would always say, "There are no conditions for surgery here. You should go to the county hospital for diagnosis and treatment!" One patient after another was thus pushed back by me.
    After a while, I realized that farmers faced many difficulties in going to the county town for treatment. For those who lived far away, the patient needed several people to carry them, it cost a lot of money, wasted a lot of workdays, and sometimes someone had to accompany them in the hospital. At the same time, I thought about myself. As a surgeon, if I couldn't perform surgery away from the hospital, what was the point of going to the countryside? I studied "On Protracted War" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." Chairman Mao's words seemed to be directed at me. A surgeon who cannot perform surgery away from the hospital, isn't this reversing the relationship between people and things?
    One day, poor peasant Tang Zhengbao was critically ill and needed surgery to save his life. At that time, I thought: if I mobilized him to go to the county hospital, it would be dozens of li away, and time would not wait, there would definitely be danger; if I performed surgery on the spot, what if something went wrong and the masses didn't understand? Just at this time, the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated, his limbs were cold, and his blood pressure dropped. The patient's family members anxiously said, "The patient is in this condition, what are you still thinking about?"
    Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility in his work and his extreme warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people." I am a Communist Party member, and I usually say that I want to learn from Bethune. Now is the time when the people need me most, how can I only think about myself? At this time, I seemed to have gained strength and decided to do everything possible to save my class brothers.
    With the support of the local Party committee, our medical team and the medical staff of the local hospital worked together to clean a room, use a cloth canopy to block the dust, use a wooden bed instead of an operating table, and use a flashlight instead of a surgical lamp. After a hard battle, the surgery was finally completed, and Tang Zhengbao was saved. Afterwards, we rescued more than a dozen critically ill patients under the same conditions.
    From my practice in the countryside, I deeply realized that in health work, the relationship between people and things is also one where the human factor comes first. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings and give full play to people's subjective initiative, we should perform surgery for farmers if there are conditions; if there are no conditions, we can also create conditions to perform surgery for farmers. Only in this way can we fight a hard battle against disease prevention and treatment in the vast world of the countryside.

### 政治给了我最大的勇气

    政治给了我最大的勇气
    去年五月，我到宿松县长铺公社参加农村巡回医疗。开始认为农村设备条件差，碰到要开刀治疗的病人，我总是说：“这里没有动手术的条件，你们还是到县医院去诊治吧！”一个又一个的病人就这样被我推了回去。
    过了一段时间，我发现农民到县城去治病的困难很多。路远的，病人要好几个人抬，花钱多，误工多，有时还要人在医院里陪着。同时，我又想了想自己，一个外科医生，离开了医院就不能开刀，下乡又有什么作用呢？我带着这个问题学习了《论持久战》。毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”毛主席的话，就好象是对我说的。一个外科医生，离开医院就不能做手术，这不是把人和物的关系颠倒了吗？
    有一天，贫农唐正保病危，需要动手术抢救。当时我想：如果动员他到县医院去，要抬几十里路，时间不等人了，肯定会有危险；就地做手术，万一出了问题，群众不谅解，怎么办？正在这个时候，病人情况骤然恶化，四肢发冷，血压下降，病人的家属着急地说：“病人都到这个地步了，你们还在想什么？”
    毛主席在《纪念白求恩》中说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”我是个共产党员，平时常说要学习白求恩，现在正是人民最需要的时候，怎能一古脑儿尽想自己呢？这时，我好象增添了力量，决心想尽一切办法，抢救自己的阶级兄弟。
    在当地党委的支持下，我们医疗队和当地医院的医务人员一起动手，把一间屋子打扫干净，用布篷挡住灰尘，用木床代替手术床，用电筒代替手术灯，经过一场苦战，终于做完了手术，使唐正保得救了。以后，我们又在同样的条件下，抢救了十几个危重的病人。
    我从下乡实践中深深体会到：在卫生工作中，人与物的关系，同样是人的因素第一。我们只要按照毛主席的教导，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，有条件要给农民开刀治病；没有条件也可以创造条件，给农民开刀治病。只有这样，我们在农村这个广阔的天地里，才能打过硬的防病治病仗。
