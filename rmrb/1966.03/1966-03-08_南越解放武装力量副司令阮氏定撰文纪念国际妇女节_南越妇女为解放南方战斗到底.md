    Nguyen Thi Dinh, Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, Writes an Article Commemorating International Women's Day
    South Vietnamese Women Fight to the End to Liberate the South
    Countless Sisters Have Demonstrated the Noble Qualities of Heroism, Unyielding Spirit, Loyalty, and Competence on All Fronts
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th) According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, Nguyen Thi Dinh, President of the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation and Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, recently published an article to celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day and commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation. The article warmly praises the enormous contributions of South Vietnamese women in the anti-American national salvation struggle and calls on them to continue to hold high the banner of anti-American national salvation and devote all their revolutionary enthusiasm to complete the common task: liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the motherland.
    The article, entitled "South Vietnamese Women in the Armed Struggle for the Liberation of the Motherland," points out that the broad masses of South Vietnamese women have participated in the armed struggle. Together with men, they used their ingenuity to seize weapons from the enemy, capture enemy strongholds, punish villains, destroy the puppet regime, and dismantle "strategic hamlets." They also led uprisings in various places, bravely and directly commanding battles, making many contributions to the work of crushing the enemy's rule, establishing combat villages, forming various armed teams, and resolutely defending villages and crushing all the enemy's "mopping-up" conspiracies.
    The article says that the crucible of struggle has forged the steel-like will of South Vietnamese women. Many kind women have become brave warriors and talented commanders. In the ranks of the Liberation Armed Forces, more and more sisters are directly taking up guns to kill the enemy and directly organizing and commanding battles, giving the enemy fatal blows on all battlefields, including in cities where the enemy's command headquarters are concentrated. The best representatives of the sisters are the two Liberation Army heroes Nguyen Thi U and Ta Thi Kieu. Their names and achievements make all the Vietnamese people feel admiration and love. Since the American bandits increased their troops to invade the South, many outstanding women such as Truong Thi Thuan and Bay Moc have emerged in the ranks of heroes who annihilate the Americans. They have added glory to South Vietnamese women.
    The article says that in order to serve the front lines, tens of thousands of sisters have joined various labor teams, and the footsteps of the sisters resound on all roads from the war zone to the front lines. In order to ensure that all the needs of the front lines are met, everyone voluntarily contributes all their strength and even their lives. Many sisters travel back and forth in the sea of fire and bullets to transport ammunition and carry the wounded. Countless sisters work hard day and night in various military medical, military, ordnance departments, and production units, ensuring the supply of every bottle of medicine, every bullet, every piece of clothing, and every bowl of rice for the troops. The sisters of the various film projection teams and cultural troupes rush to the front lines and the rear, encouraging the soldiers to bravely kill the enemy.
    The article says that in the construction of the armed forces, the mothers of the soldiers must be mentioned. They wholeheartedly support the troops, receive the wounded back home to recuperate, and, regardless of their old age and frailty, voluntarily serve on the front lines. South Vietnamese women also enthusiastically mobilize their husbands and sons to join the army and take on all household chores.
    The article says that in summarizing the achievements of women in the armed struggle in the past few years, there are several prominent features: First, in this second war of resistance, more and more Kinh and ethnic minority women in the mountainous areas have participated in armed activities, and women are participating in the work of all departments of the armed forces. This proves that the revolutionary consciousness of women has been continuously improved, and the awareness of anti-American national salvation is getting higher and higher. Second, on the front line of armed struggle, women can do all kinds of work and have made outstanding achievements. This proves that the potential of women is very great, and the perseverance of women is very strong.
    The article points out that South Vietnamese women have achieved the high honor of being awarded the "Bronze Wall" Medal, First Class, by the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces for their achievements in political struggle, on the production front, and in armed activities. They deserve the title of "Heroic, Unyielding, Loyal, and Competent" awarded by the Vietnamese People's Revolutionary Party. These achievements are the crystallization of the high national and class consciousness of South Vietnamese women, and the crystallization of the high patriotic spirit and the high hatred for the American invaders and their traitorous running dogs. South Vietnamese sisters clearly understand that only when the nation and the workers and peasants are completely liberated can women be truly liberated from the shackles of the old society. Because of this, the sisters have further enhanced their spirit of courage and sacrifice, and have carried forward the tenacious and hard-working qualities of Vietnamese women. They insisted on participating in various military activities. This achievement is also the result of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation organizing and educating South Vietnamese women, leading them to advance bravely on the road of anti-American national salvation.
    The article says: At present, due to the US imperialists' conspiracy to increase troops and expand the war of aggression, the anti-American national salvation struggle of the South Vietnamese people will be even more arduous and cruel. Our road ahead is full of glory, but also full of difficulties. We women must strive to improve our level in all aspects, firmly adhere to the position of fighting to the end, and devote all our revolutionary enthusiasm to complete the common task: liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the motherland. This road to national salvation is also the only road for our women to save ourselves. We must stand up with the whole people, hold high the banner of anti-American national salvation, and annihilate the American army and the puppet army. The article calls on all South Vietnamese women to compete with the Northern women who are carrying out the "Three Responsibilities" movement and resolutely defeat the American aggressors.

    南越解放武装力量副司令阮氏定撰文纪念国际妇女节
    南越妇女为解放南方战斗到底
    无数姐妹在各条战线上表现了英雄、不屈、忠厚和能干的高贵品质
    据新华社河内七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方妇女解放联合会会长、越南南方解放武装力量副司令阮氏定，最近为庆祝“三八”国际妇女节和纪念越南南方妇女解放联合会成立五周年发表文章，热烈赞扬越南南方妇女在抗美救国斗争中的巨大贡献，并号召她们继续高举抗美救国的旗帜，拿出自己全部的革命热情来完成共同的任务：解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。
    这篇题为《在为争取祖国的解放而进行武装斗争中的越南南方妇女》的文章指出，广大的越南南方妇女参加了武装斗争。她们同男人一起，用智谋夺取敌人的枪支，攻下敌人的据点，惩办恶棍，摧毁伪政权，捣毁“战略村”。她们还在各地领导了起义，勇敢地直接指挥战斗，为粉碎敌人的统治，建立战斗村，成立各种武装队伍，决心保卫村庄，粉碎敌人的一切“扫荡”阴谋等工作作出了许多贡献。
    文章说，斗争的熔炉冶炼出越南南方妇女钢铁般的意志。许多善良的妇女已经成了勇敢的战士和天才的指战员。在解放武装力量的队伍中，有越来越多的姐妹直接拿枪杀敌，直接组织和指挥战斗，在所有各个战场上，连同在敌人的首脑机关集中的城市里，都给予了敌人致命的打击。最能代表姐妹们的是两位解放军英雄阮氏坞和谢氏娇。她们的名字和成绩，使越南全体人民都感到钦佩和敬爱。自从美国强盗增派军队侵入南方以来，在歼美勇士的行列中，已经出现了许多象张氏顺、七莫等出色妇女。她们为南方妇女增添了光彩。
    文章说，为了服务前线，数以万计的姐妹加入了各个民工队，从战区到前线，所有各条道路上都响彻着姐妹们的脚步声。为了保证满足前线的一切需要，每个人都自愿贡献自己的一切力量以至生命。许多姐妹在火海弹雨中往来运送弹药、搬运伤员。不知多少姐妹在各个军医、军用、军械部门和生产单位中，日夜辛勤地劳动着，保证部队的每一瓶药、每一颗子弹、每一件衣服和每一碗饭的供应。各个电影放映队和文工团的姐妹们，奔驰在前线和后方，鼓励战士们英勇杀敌。
    文章说，在武装力量的建设工作中，必须提到各位战士母亲。她们全心全力扶养部队，接待伤员回家养伤，还不顾自己年老力衰，自愿到前线服务。越南南方妇女还热情地动员丈夫和儿子参军，承担一切家务。
    文章说，在总结妇女在过去几年中的武装斗争成绩时，有几个突出的特点：一，在这第二次抗战中，越来越多的京族和山区少数民族妇女参加了武装活动，在武装力量的所有各个部门的工作中都有妇女参加。这一点证明了妇女的革命觉悟程度得到不断的提高，抗美救国的意识越来越高涨。二，在武装斗争的战线上，一切工作，妇女都可以做，并且做出了出色的成绩。这证明妇女的潜力是非常大的，妇女的毅力是非常坚强的。
    文章指出，越南南方妇女在政治斗争中、在生产战线上和在武装活动中，以自己的这些成绩，获得了南方解放武装力量授予一级“铜墙”勋章的崇高荣誉，配得上越南人民革命党授予的“英雄、不屈、忠厚、能干”的称号。这些成绩是南方妇女高度民族觉悟和阶级觉悟的结晶，是高度的爱国主义精神和对美国侵略者及其卖国走狗的高度仇恨的结晶。越南南方姐妹都清楚地理解到：只有当民族和工农获得完全解放的时候，妇女才能真正地从旧社会的枷锁中解放出来。由于这样，姊妹们更加提高了勇敢精神和牺牲精神，发扬了越南妇女的坚韧不拔、刻苦耐劳的品质。坚持参加了各项军事活动。这个成绩也是越南南方民族解放阵线和越南南方妇女解放联合会组织和教育南方妇女，领导她们在抗美救国道路上勇猛前进的结果。
    文章说：目前，由于美帝国主义增兵和扩大侵略战争的阴谋，越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争还要艰苦和残酷。在我们前进的道路上，充满着光荣，也充满着艰难。我们妇女要努力提高各方面的水平，坚定战斗到底的立场，拿出自己的全部革命热情来完成共同任务：解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。这条救国的道路也正是我们妇女自救的唯一道路。我们要同全民一齐站起来，高举抗美救国的旗帜，歼灭美军和伪军。文章号召全体南方妇女同开展“三承担”运动的北方妇女进行竞赛，坚决打败美国侵略者。
