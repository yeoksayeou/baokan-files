    A Letter from Young Pioneers
    The No. 1 Branch of Shanghai Taishan Refractory Material Factory received a letter from a group of Young Pioneers, along with 92 cents. The factory initiated a heated discussion among its employees regarding this matter. ...
    The office of the director of the No. 1 Branch of Shanghai Taishan Refractory Material Factory recently received the following letter:
    Dear Uncles and Aunts in the Director's Office,
    Hello.
    Yesterday, while we were doing labor, we saw a cart of waste paper about to be thrown away. We felt very sorry about it. Our team decided to ask the factory leaders to sell the waste paper. However, there was no one in the director's office, so we had to sell it ourselves. The waste products sold included one *jin* of silk cloth, eight *jin* of waste paper, and eighteen *jin* of broken glass, totaling 92 cents. We are now handing it over to the factory.
          Sincerely,
    All members of the Third Team, Class 2, Grade 2, Fuxing Middle School
    The director of the Taishan Factory No. 1 Branch felt very heavy-hearted upon reading this letter. After investigation, it was learned that these admirable children, unable to find the director, had asked a factory worker, who replied, "The stuff is dirty, just throw it away!"
    "Just throw it away!" Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, some people in the factory had thrown away two 90% new bearing housings and two large bearings worth more than 150 yuan as waste products; others had thrown away 14 kilograms of old copper parts; as for screws, nuts, and broken firebricks, bituminous coal, and scrap wood that could be recycled as raw materials... these were even more within the scope of "throwing away." No wonder people often waited at the main gate for the "garbage" they "threw away"!
    The Party General Branch of the No. 1 Branch linked these many phenomena together and recalled that they had held an exhibition in the factory last April entitled "Practice Economy and Oppose Waste." Although the atmosphere of practicing economy in the factory had improved, it was not deep enough, mainly because the leading comrades did not have a sufficient understanding of the long-term and arduous nature of implementing the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. After first examining the leadership's thinking, they summarized and wrote an article entitled "What Does '92 Cents' Show?" The article solemnly excerpted Chairman Mao's quotations, printed the article as a document, and distributed it to all factory employees for discussion and study.
    This special document deeply touched the hearts of all factory employees. More than eighty production teams in the factory, after reading the children's letter in the document, felt very ashamed. Almost everyone had these kinds of thoughts: "Why can't some of us do what the fourteen- or fifteen-year-old students of Fuxing Middle School can do?" "92 cents is just a grain of rice in the waste pile of our factory..." "Our sense of responsibility as masters of our own house is not as good as the children's!" In the study and discussion, the topic naturally turned to what wasteful loopholes still existed in the factory?
    Workers in the material preparation workshop pointed to a mountain of magnesite and said:
  "These raw materials are transported from the Northeast thousands of miles away to Shanghai, but they are often thrown away as garbage simply because the specifications do not meet the requirements. It's such a pity!" This was a big loophole, and they immediately thought of ways to try to use this batch of raw materials that were previously considered "garbage" without affecting the quality of the refractory bricks. In the past month, they had utilized more than 40 tons; the workers in the selection team were more careful in selecting broken firebricks for recycling, and in just over ten days, they picked out more than ten tons of broken firebricks worth more than 100 yuan from the "garbage"; the research office changed the old habit of experimenting and throwing away materials, and repeatedly used recycled materials without fear of trouble, saving the country a lot of high-grade refractory materials... Every workshop and every team immediately took action, earnestly plugging the wasteful loopholes in the production process.
    In the process of study and discussion, new people and new deeds continued to emerge. A worker in the machine repair department collected more than 30 kilograms of copper shavings and scrap materials in just over ten days; a worker in the kiln workshop paid attention to whether there were any "treasures" in the garbage dump on the second day of study and discussion. That day, he indeed found a new steel wire rope twelve millimeters thick and twenty meters long; a cleaning worker in the forming workshop paid attention to the garbage truck every day, saying: "I guarantee that no one will pick up the garbage I push out!"... A new atmosphere began to grow in the factory.

### 一封少先队员的来信

    一封少先队员的来信
    上海泰山耐火材料厂一分厂收到了少先队员的一封信，信里附了九角二分钱。工厂通过这件事，在职工里展开了一场热烈的讨论。……
    上海市泰山耐火材料厂一分厂的厂长室，不久前收到这样一封来信：厂长室的叔叔、阿姨们，
    你们好。
    我们在昨天劳动时，看见一车废纸要倒掉，大家感到很可惜，我小队同学就决定要求厂里领导人，把废纸卖掉，但是，厂长室里没有人，于是我们只好自己去把它卖掉。卖掉的废品有丝布一斤、废纸八斤、碎玻璃十八斤，共卖九角二分。现交于厂方。
          此致敬礼
    复兴中学中二（2）班第三小队全体队员
    泰山厂一分厂厂长看到这封信，心情十分沉重，经了解，才知道这些可敬的孩子，找不到厂长，曾经问过厂里一位工作人员，得到的回答是：“东西很脏，倒掉算了！”
    “倒掉算了！”就是在这种思想主导下，厂里曾有人把两只九成新的轴承壳和价值一百五十多元的两只大轴承当作废品倒掉；也有人把十四公斤重的旧铜零件倒掉；至于那些螺丝、螺帽，以及还可回收做原料的碎火砖、二煤、碎木头……更是属于“倒掉”的范围了。难怪每天大门口常有人等他们“倒掉”的“垃圾”！
    一分厂党总支把这许多现象联系起来，又回忆了去年四月份曾在厂里办了一个“厉行节约、反对浪费”的展览会，厂里节约风气虽有好转，但还不够深入，主要原因是领导同志对贯彻党的勤俭建国的方针的长期性、艰巨性认识不足。他们首先检查了领导思想以后，就汇总写成一篇题为《“九角二分钱”说明了什么？》的文章，文章里郑重地摘录了毛主席的语录，把这篇文章打印成文件，分发全厂职工，讨论学习。
    这个特别的文件，深深触动了全厂职工的心弦。全厂八十多个生产小组，读了文件里孩子的信，都感到十分惭愧，大家几乎都有这样的话：“复兴中学十四五岁的孩子能做到的事，为什么我们有些人就不能做到？”“九角二分只不过是我们厂浪费堆里的一粒米……”“我们有些人当家作主的责任感还不及孩子！”在学习讨论里，话题很自然地转到厂里究竟还有那些浪费漏洞？
    制料工段工人指着堆积如山的镁砂说：
  “这些原料从千里外的东北运到上海，只因为规格不合，常常当垃圾扔掉，太可惜了！”这是个大漏洞，他们立即想办法，在不影响耐火砖质量的情况下，试用这批过去当“垃圾”的原料，近一个月来，就利用了四十多吨；拣料小组工人，挑选回炉碎火砖更细心了，十多天就从“垃圾”里拣出十多吨价值一百多元的碎火砖；研究室改变了过去边试验边扔料的老习惯，不怕麻烦地反复使用回炉料，更为国家节约许多高级耐火材料……各个工段、各个小组一下子都行动起来，认真从生产过程中堵塞浪费的漏洞。
    在学习讨论过程中，新人新事不断涌现，机修部门一位工人十多天就收集了铜屑碎料三十多公斤；窑炉工段一位工人在学习讨论的第二天，就注意垃圾堆里有没有“宝”？这一天，果然被他发现一根十二毫米粗、二十米长的新钢丝绳；成型工段一位清洁工人每天注意垃圾车，他说：“我保证做到我推出去的垃圾没有人拾！”……一股新风气开始在厂里成长。  （德）
