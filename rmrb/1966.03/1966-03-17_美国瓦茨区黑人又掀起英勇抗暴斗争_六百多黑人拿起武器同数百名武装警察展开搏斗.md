    Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, 16th: The Watts district of Los Angeles, USA, where a world-shaking black anti-tyranny struggle erupted last August, has once again seen black people taking up arms and bravely resisting police persecution.
    More than six hundred black people participated in the struggle that broke out on the evening of the 15th. The spark that ignited this incident was the police's unwarranted arrest of a young black man, accusing him of the crime of "throwing stones at cars." This once again enraged the black people who were deeply dissatisfied with the authorities' tyrannical rule. They gathered in groups, rushing to the scene of the incident, and unanimously condemned the police's brutality.
    The Los Angeles local authorities, frightened like "birds startled by the twang of a bow" by the previous anti-tyranny struggle, hastily dispatched hundreds of fully armed police and ordered three thousand National Guard troops to be on alert. However, the police's actions fueled the black people's anger.
    According to the Associated Press, in addition to using stones as weapons, the black masses also exchanged fire with the police. They also overturned and burned some cars, and attacked shops that had consistently cheated and exploited black people. The fight between the black people and the police lasted for six hours. According to preliminary statistics, one black person was killed, more than twenty people were injured, and twenty-seven people were arrested.
    After the incident, the authorities were very afraid that the situation would further escalate. California Governor Brown had already rushed back to Los Angeles from Washington that night to personally plan the suppression.
    In the unprecedented anti-tyranny struggle last August, thousands of black people, unafraid of violence and sacrifice, took up arms and fought more than 20,000 fully armed soldiers and police for more than a week, adding a glorious page to the history of the black people's struggle in the United States.

    美国瓦茨区黑人又掀起英勇抗暴斗争
    六百多黑人拿起武器同数百名武装警察展开搏斗
    新华社十六日讯　洛杉矶消息：曾经在去年八月爆发过震动世界的黑人抗暴斗争的美国洛杉矶市瓦茨区，黑人群众再一次拿起武器英勇抗击警察的迫害。
    十五日晚间爆发的这次斗争有六百多名黑人参加。引起这次事件的导火线，是警察无理逮捕一名黑人青年，加在他头上的罪名是：“向汽车扔石头”。这又一次激怒了对当局的暴虐统治十分不满的黑人。他们成群结队，冲向出事地点，齐声谴责警察的暴行。
    被上次抗暴斗争吓得象“惊弓之鸟”的洛杉矶地方当局，慌忙出动了几百名全副武装的警察，并且命令三千名国民警卫队处于戒备状态。但是警察的行动在黑人的怒火上加了油。
    据美联社报道，黑人群众除了用石头做武器之外，还同警察交了火。他们还推翻和烧毁了一些汽车，袭击了一贯欺诈和剥削黑人的商店。黑人们和警察的搏斗持续了六个小时。据初步统计，一名黑人被杀害，二十多人受伤，二十七人被捕。
    事情发生后，当局非常害怕事态进一步扩大。加利福尼亚州州长布朗已经在当天晚上从华盛顿赶回洛杉矶亲自策划镇压。
    在去年八月那场规模空前的抗暴斗争中，成千上万的黑人不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，拿起武器同两万多名全副武装的军警搏斗了一个多星期，给美国黑人斗争史增添了光辉的一页。（附图片）
