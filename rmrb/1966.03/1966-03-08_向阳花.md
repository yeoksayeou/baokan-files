    "Sunflower"
    Collective creation of the Printmaking Department of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts
    Yi Heyuan, lyricist
    The woodcut series "Sunflower" depicts the advanced deeds of Comrade Chen Xueying, member of the Party General Branch Committee and women's team leader of the Sanshan Brigade in Zhenhai, Zhejiang.
    In 1963, Comrade Chen Xueying voluntarily settled in a backward production team. Based on the opinions of the masses, she sorted out the work point accounts of the production team leader, who was also her nephew; and patiently helped the team leader and her timid husband. When the area was hit by a flood, she led the commune members to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and overcome the natural disaster. The broad masses of commune members said she was a good example for the women of Sanshan.
    Communist Party member Chen Xueying,
    Sunflower blooms dazzling bright,
    Voluntarily settles in a backward team,
    Commune members welcome her with delight.
    Collective interest kept in mind,
    Work point accounts must be settled clear,
    Though the team leader is her own nephew,
    How can one be partial for personal favor?
    The husband is as timid as Xiwang,
    Xueying is like Li Shuangshuang,
    Not afraid of offending people for the public good,
    The revolutionary principles explained in detail.
    If cadres do not labor,
    They are like duckweed, difficult to take root.
    Xueying's heartfelt words,
    Every sentence touches the team leader's heart!
    News of the bumper harvest spreads quickly,
    But unexpectedly, a torrential rain brings disaster,
    A season of hard work washed away,
    Like a sudden misfortune from the sky!
    Heroes and good men are not afraid of difficulties,
    Learn from the foolish old man who moves mountains,
    Chairman's writings guide the way,
    Commune members are clear-minded and work harder.
    People rely on the heart, trees rely on roots,
    Hard work brings a good harvest,
    Red flowers bloom everywhere,
    Everyone praises Chen Xueying.

    “向阳花”
    浙江美术学院版画系集体创作
    易和元　配诗
    “向阳花”木刻组画，描写了浙江镇海三山大队党总支委员、妇女大队长陈雪英同志的先进事迹。
    一九六三年，陈雪英同志主动到后进队落户。根据群众意见，对生产队长也就是她的亲侄清理了工分账目；并耐心帮助队长和胆小怕事的丈夫。当遭受洪灾时，她又领导社员，发扬自力更生精神，战胜自然灾害。广大社员说她是三山妇女的好榜样。
    共产党员陈雪英，向阳花开耀眼明，主动安家后进队，社员个个喜相迎。
    集体利益记在心，工分账目要算清，队长虽是亲侄子，为公哪能徇私情。
    丈夫胆小象喜旺，雪英她是李双双，为公岂怕得罪人，革命道理仔细讲。
    干部如果不劳动，就象浮萍难生根。雪英一席知心话，句句打动队长心！
    丰收喜讯快传开，岂料暴雨又成灾，一场辛苦付流水，好比横祸天外来！
    英雄好汉不怕难，要学愚公会移山，主席著作把路引，社员心明干劲添。
    人靠心来树靠根，辛苦换来好收成，红花朵朵开遍地，人人称赞陈雪英。
