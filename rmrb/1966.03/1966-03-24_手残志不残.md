    Handicapped in Body, But Not in Spirit
    Xu Xuehui, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Youth League of the Kunming Department Store

    Six years ago, Xu Xuehui lost both hands while fighting Nationalist bandits who were illegally crossing the border, in order to protect state property. At the beginning of last year, Comrade Xu Xuehui stepped onto a new job position. In the new work position, Comrade Xu Xuehui encountered new difficulties and tests. Because she armed her mind with Mao Zedong Thought, she finally overcame the new difficulties and passed the new tests. This article, "Handicapped in Body, But Not in Spirit," introduces her continuous progress in the new work position, and the source of the strength that encourages her to move forward. ——Editor

    In a peaceful environment, tests of bloodshed and sacrifice are not always frequently encountered. The tests encountered in large quantities are: How to treat class struggle? How to correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and the interests of the Party? How to treat various difficulties? In the past year, I have encountered many problems in my thinking and work. These problems are a new test.

    In early 1965, the organization transferred me from the Yunnan Provincial People's Bank to the Kunming Recently Department Store to serve as the secretary of the Communist Youth League General Branch. In the store, the target of the Communist Youth League's work is mainly young shop assistants. To do a good job in the League, to understand young people, it is necessary to take some time to stand at the counter and bring ideological work to the counter. Standing at the counter was a new subject for me. I used to be in an office, mainly sitting in the office; now, standing at the counter for a whole day, my back aches and I am exhausted. Despite this, I can still cope. However, standing at the counter itself is a revolutionary issue, and it has not been resolved in my mind. For example, some comrades asked me: "Little Xu, how did you come here?" I immediately replied: "I am doing Communist Youth League work in the store's political office." Let him know that I am not a shop assistant, but a cadre participating in labor. Some young people in the store are not at ease with commercial work. How can I do a good job for others when I have this kind of thinking? It just so happened that a leading comrade saw me standing at the counter and encouraged me, saying: "Little Xu is indeed a hero, go wherever needed!" With such a high evaluation of me by the leadership, how can I always consider personal gains and losses? I must do a good job and not let down the expectations of the organization and the trust of my comrades.

    After I lost my hands, although I overcame the difficulties in general life such as eating, dressing, combing my hair, and washing my face, the speed and quality of handling these personal life matters, whether fast, slow, good, or bad, had little to do with others. It was just that I rested less, got up earlier, and went to bed later. Now, I am participating in collective labor, and the quality of serving customers directly affects the quality of service to the people. At first, I wrote orders and priced them at the calico counter, because this counter had a dedicated cashier, and the work of the shop assistants was relatively simple. But in order to further improve the quality of service, I learned about the properties of linen and woolen fabrics from the shop assistants, as well as the amount of fabric needed for adults' and children's clothing, so that I could serve as a good consultant for customers.

    But to do a good job in the entire League General Branch, to be more familiar with young people, to understand young people, it is not enough to work in just one counter. I asked the Party Committee to let me participate in labor at the watch and clock counter on the third floor, where young people are more concentrated. This counter's work is more complicated. At first, I could only play the role of "guarding" the counter. When customers came, I had to stand aside. Later, I humbly asked the comrades for advice, learned about product knowledge, and at the same time, I tried to take the watch out of the glass cabinet. I insisted on practicing every day and finally could take the watch out of the cabinet and serve customers independently.

    The other end of the watch and clock counter sells records. Many customers often want to try out the records while selecting them. To try out the records, you need to crank the record player and change the stylus. What if you don't have fingers? Although many customers, seeing that I didn't have hands, rushed to help, I thought, I am a shop assistant, this is what I should do, how can I let customers do it for me? I tried again to hold the record player with my left wrist and crank the handle with my right wrist. The first time, I had no experience and couldn't control it, and almost overturned the record player. After practice, I was finally able to wind the spring. The most difficult thing was to change the stylus when trying out records. Every time I changed one or two records, I had to change the stylus once. To take the needle out of the small iron box, should I ask someone to open it? Or should I open it myself? I had another struggle in my mind. At this time, the glorious images of Comrades Lei Feng and Wang Jie encouraged me. No! I must learn to open it myself. At first, I didn't open it well, and the needles scattered all over the floor. I thought, "Failure is the mother of success," and I still had to practice. I picked up the needles, and then used both wrists to clamp the needle and put it on the head of the record player. The stylus was short and small, and when I clamped it with both wrists, I couldn't even see the tip of the needle. What should I do? Although the comrades also rushed to do it every time, I thought, if they all replaced my labor, wouldn't I never learn the ability to serve the people for the rest of my life? The more they rushed to do it and cared about me, the more I had to learn it. Now I can not only change records, but also change styluses.

    For a period of time, I participated in labor at the eyeglasses counter. In addition to selling finished products, sometimes customers choose a frame and also need to temporarily install lenses on the counter. I was determined to learn how to install lenses. Some comrades were very concerned about me and advised me, saying: "Forget it! It's difficult for those of us with fingers to learn, it's even more difficult for you without fingers." But I thought, if others use one times the energy to learn, I will spend ten times the energy to learn. Every time I installed a pair of eyeglasses, I felt as happy as a soldier winning a battle. At first, the installation speed was very slow, but later I could install more than thirty pairs every day.

    In overcoming difficulties, Chairman Mao's teachings have always been the great motivation for me to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. The customers' encouragement and trust also spurred me to keep moving forward. Some customers, seeing me installing lenses, insisted on buying the pair I installed. Although I repeatedly stated that I was an apprentice and the quality of the installation was not good, they still wanted to buy it. What moved me the most was that a customer said: "I don't wear eyeglasses, but I also want to buy a pair as a souvenir. This is not for buying eyeglasses, I must take your revolutionary spirit back with me."

    Although I withstood a test in fighting the bandits, it does not mean that I have obtained a "pass" in class struggle from now on, or obtained "immunity" to bourgeois ideology. Any negligence or relaxation in ideological transformation may lead to a fall.

    Our store studied the People's Liberation Army last year, and after the socialist education movement, the ideological awareness of the staff has greatly improved, but the class struggle inside and outside the counter still exists. Some young people are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. Individual shop assistants talk about eating and dressing and pursue a bourgeois lifestyle. Faced with this situation, should I learn from the Nanjing Road Good Eighth Company and remain spotless, or should I slide down? This is a serious test for myself.

    After I was transferred from the countryside to work in the city, my thoughts and feelings had changed somewhat. For a while, I was very particular about dressing, mistakenly thinking that dressing well was more appropriate. Almost all of my monthly salary was spent on food and clothing. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "China is a large country, but it is still very poor. It will take decades to make China rich." Chairman Mao's words made me realize that our country is carrying out socialist construction, and there are many things that need us to do. If we are not hardworking in our thinking, our revolutionary will will decline.

    After arriving at the store, although I was more vigilant about this issue, there was still a struggle in my mind. When the store received new-style sweaters and beautiful underwear, I also wanted to buy them. But when I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lei Feng's words: "In work, aim for high standards, in life, aim for low standards," I restrained myself. To correct others, one must first correct oneself. If I don't have the spirit of diligence and thrift, I won't have the right to speak in doing other people's work, and my back won't be straight.

    Going from an office to the grassroots, from doing general work to doing grassroots leadership work for the Communist Youth League, were all new tests for me.

    The first difficulty I encountered was the issue of working hours. Office work is more regular, while store employees work in shifts. When I rest, the shop assistants don't rest, and when the shop assistants rest, I don't rest. What should I do? I thought, standing at the counter itself is a process of doing work, so I can't just buy and sell, but also pay attention to observing the problems that shop assistants often encounter in their work, the problems that easily cause ideological struggle, and strive to do ideological work to the point. In addition, after work, before going to bed, there is still some free time to visit collective dormitories and talk to comrades. I can also use my rest time to visit families. Although doing so takes up my rest time, I think that a revolutionary, especially a political cadre, must not use the sound of the bell for work as the dividing line of work! Serving the people should be regardless of time and place. Wherever there are masses, we must go to work, and ideological work can never be off duty.

    In the past year, in the face of many new tests, thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings, the Party Committee's care, the comrades' help, and the customers' encouragement, I have been able to overcome one difficulty after another in my continuous progress and withstand one test after another. But in all aspects, I am still not very strong. In the future, I will definitely work harder to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and better complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

    手残志不残
    共青团昆明市近日百货商店总支书记　徐学惠
    六年前，为了保护国家财产，在和偷越国境的国民党残匪搏斗中失去双手的徐学惠同志，去年年初踏上了新的工作岗位。在新的工作岗位上，徐学惠同志遇到了一个个新的困难和考验。由于她以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，她终于战胜了新的困难，闯过了新的考验。《手残志不残》这篇文章，就介绍了她自己在新的工作岗位上不断前进的过程，以及鼓舞她不断前进的力量的源泉。　——编者
    在和平环境里，流血牺牲的考验总不会经常碰到的。大量碰到的考验是，怎样对待阶级斗争？怎样正确处理个人利益与党的利益的关系？怎样对待各种困难？一年来，我在思想上、工作上碰到许多问题。这些问题是一种新的考验。
    一九六五年初，组织上把我从云南省人民银行调到昆明市近日百货商店，担任共青团总支书记。在商店里，共青团的工作对象主要是青年营业员。要做好团的工作，要了解青年，就必须抽出一定的时间去站柜台，把思想工作做到柜台中去。站柜台，对我来说是个新的课题。我过去在机关里，主要是坐办公室；现在，站一天柜台，腰酸背痛，精疲力竭。尽管这样，我总算还可以对付过去。但站柜台本身就是革命的问题，在我思想上并没有得到解决。比如，有的同志问我：“小徐你怎么上这儿来？”我马上回答说：“我是在商店政治处做团的工作。”让他知道我不是营业员，而是干部来参加劳动的。商店青年中有的人还不安心商业工作，自己有这种思想怎么去做好别人的工作呢？恰巧有位领导同志看到我站柜台就鼓励我说：“小徐到底是英雄，那里需要到那里！”领导对我这样高的估价，自己怎么能老考虑个人的得失。我一定好好干，不能辜负组织的期望和同志们的信任。
    在我失去双手以后，虽然克服了吃饭、穿衣、梳头、洗脸等一般生活上的困难，但处理这些个人生活上的事，快点、慢点、好点、差点和别人关系不大，无非是我少休息点、起早点、睡晚点，现在是参加集体劳动，接待顾客的好差、快慢就直接影响到为人民服务的质量。开始，我在花布柜开单、计价，因为这个柜有专人收款，营业员的工作比较简单。但是为了进一步提高服务质量，我就向营业员了解麻纱、线呢等的性能，大人、小孩缝衣服的用布量，给顾客当好参谋。
    但要做好整个团总支的工作，更多地熟悉青年，了解青年，只在一个柜劳动是不够的。我要求党委让我到青年比较集中的三楼钟表柜去参加劳动。这个柜劳动比较复杂，开始我只能起个“守”柜台的作用，顾客一来我只好靠边站。后来，我虚心向同志们请教，学习商品知识，同时我试着从玻璃柜里往外拿表，坚持天天练，终于能从柜台里把表拿出来，可以单独接待顾客了。
    钟表柜的另一头是卖唱片。许多顾客往往在挑选唱片中要试唱，试唱片要摇唱机、换唱针，没有手指头怎么办？虽然许多顾客见我没有手都争着来帮忙，可我想，我是营业员，这是我应当做的事，怎能让顾客代劳呢？我又试着用左手腕按住唱机，右手腕摇手把，第一次没经验，掌握不住，差一点把唱机摇翻了。经过练习终于可以把发条上紧了。最困难的是试唱片要换针，每换一、两次唱片，就要换一次唱针。要从小铁盒里拿出针来，是请人开呢？还是自己开呢？思想上又有了斗争。这时雷锋、王杰等同志的光辉形象鼓舞了我。不！一定要自己学会开。开始开不好，针撒了满地，我想“失败是成功之母”，还是要练下去。把针拣起来，再用两只手腕夹住针，往唱机头上安，唱针又短又小，两腕一夹，连针尖都看不见了，又怎么办？虽然每次同志们也都抢着干，但我想，都让他们代替了我的劳动，我不是一辈子也学不会为人民服务的本领了吗？他们越抢着干越关心我，我就越要学会它。现在我不仅可以换唱片，而且也会换唱针了。
    有一段时间，我在眼镜柜参加劳动。这个柜除了卖成品外，有时顾客挑选了镜架，还要在柜台上临时安装镜片。我就下决心学会装镜片。有些同志非常关心我，劝我说：“算了吧！我们有手指头的人都难学，你没有手指头就更难学了。”但我想别人用一倍的精力去学，我就花十倍精力去学。每当我装上了一副眼镜，就象战士打了胜仗一样，心里有说不出的高兴。最初，安装的速度很慢，后来每天可以安装三十多副了。
    在克服困难中，毛主席的教导一直是我排除万难，去争取胜利的巨大动力。顾客们对我的鼓励、信任也鞭策着我不断前进。有的顾客看到我装镜片，一定要买我装的那副。虽然我一再声明，自己是学徒，装的质量不好，他们还是要买。最使我感动的是，有位顾客说：“我不戴眼镜，但也要买一副做纪念，这不是为了买眼镜，我一定要把你这种革命精神带回去。”
    我虽然在和匪徒斗争中，经受住了一次考验，但并不等于从此就获得了阶级斗争中的
  “通行证”，获得了对资产阶级思想的“免疫力”。思想改造的任何疏忽、放松，都会有摔跤的可能。
    我们商店去年学习了解放军，又经过社会主义教育运动，职工思想觉悟有了很大提高，但柜台内外的阶级斗争仍然存在着。青年中有的人受资产阶级思想影响比较深，个别营业员讲吃、讲穿，追求资产阶级的生活方式。面对这种情况，自己是学习南京路上好八连一尘不染呢，还是滑下去？这是对自己一个严重的考验。
    我从乡下调到城市工作后，思想感情上曾起过一些变化，有一段很讲究穿着，错误地认为穿好点才相称。每月的工资几乎全花在吃穿上了。后来我学习了毛主席著作，毛主席教导我们：“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。”毛主席的话，使我认识到我国正在进行社会主义建设，很多事需要我们去做，如果思想上不艰苦，革命意志就会衰退。
    到商店后，我虽然比较警惕这个问题，但在思想上还是有斗争的。商店到了新式的毛衣、漂亮的卫生衣，自己也很想买。但一想起毛主席的教导，想到雷锋同志说的：“工作上向高标准看齐，生活上向低标准看齐。”就克制住了。正人必先正己。自己没有勤俭节约的精神，就没有取得做别人工作的发言权，腰杆就不硬。
    由机关到基层，由做一般工作到做团的基层领导工作，对我都是一个个新的考验。
    首先碰到的困难是工作时间问题，机关工作比较规律，商店职工是轮休。我休息时营业员们不休息，营业员们休息时我又不休息，怎么办呢？我想，站柜台本身就是个做工作的过程，因而不能只是买买卖卖，还要留心观察营业员们在工作中常常碰到的问题，容易引起思想斗争的问题，力争把思想工作做到点子上去。另外，在下班以后，睡觉以前，还有点空隙时间可以串串集体宿舍，和同志们谈谈心，也可以利用自己休息时间去家庭访问。虽然这样做要占去自己的休息时间，但我想，一个革命者，特别是政治干部，绝不能以上下班的铃声作为工作的分界线！为人民服务应该是不分时间地点的。那里有群众那里就要我们去工作，思想工作是永远不能下班的。
    一年来，在许许多多新的考验面前，由于有毛主席的教导，党委的关怀，同志们的帮助，顾客的鼓舞，才使我在不断前进中战胜了一个又一个困难，经受住一次又一次考验。但从各方面看，我都还很不过硬。今后我一定更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，更好地完成党交给的任务。
