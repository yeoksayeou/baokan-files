    Imperialism and its Servants Should Not Rejoice Too Soon
    Public Opinion in Mali, Burma, and Other Countries Condemns Imperialism's Orchestration of Military Coups in Africa
    Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, March 12th: A recent editorial in the Malian weekly "Development," broadcast by Malian radio, condemned imperialism for orchestrating military coups in African countries in an attempt to obstruct the African revolution.
    The editorial stated: "We have said many times before that imperialism attempts to plot all kinds of conspiracies, fund all subversive activities, and provoke all kinds of divisions in order to obstruct the African revolution, finding accomplices among African traitors and those who can help it make a fortune. The series of military coups can only be understood in this way."
    The editorial warned imperialism and its servants not to rejoice too soon, "because, according to the dialectic of things themselves, we know that this situation is temporary and cannot last long. The people of African countries will not fail to react accordingly to this new situation created by imperialism and its servants."
    The editorial continued: "The African people have been fully mobilized. The insidious plans of the imperialists have been exposed, namely: imperialism always attempts to overthrow all leaders who are making genuine efforts to lead their countries out of the abyss of underdevelopment, and always attempts to brutally destroy all the fundamental interests of the masses of the people."
    The editorial concluded, "The African people of our entire continent will eventually see 'the utter demise of imperialism.'"
    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Georgetown dispatch: Several mass organizations in British Guiana recently held a forum in Georgetown on the situation in Ghana, strongly condemning the United States and Britain for instigating reactionary forces to overthrow the Nkrumah government.
    Several hundred people attended the forum. Leaders of organizations such as the National Renaissance Committee, the African Association for Cultural Relations with Independent Africa, and the African-Asian-American Association condemned the military coup in Ghana in their speeches.
    The forum passed a resolution expressing "full support for the African people's liberation movement and the struggle to wipe out white supremacist governments, colonialism, and neo-colonialism from the entire African continent."
    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 12th: The famous Burmese writer Du Ama published an article in the "People's Daily" on the 12th, pointing out that the coup in Ghana was orchestrated by American and British imperialists.
    She said: "The African people are breaking free from the shackles of old colonialists and establishing independent countries. At this time, imperialists are instigating their lackeys to launch coups in newly independent countries, attempting to implement their neo-colonialist policies, and exploit and interfere with these countries."
    She said: The African people must drive out the imperialists and their lackeys before they consolidate their positions.

    帝国主义及其仆从不要高兴得太早了
    马里缅甸等国舆论谴责帝国主义在非洲策动军事政变
    新华社巴马科十二日电　马里电台广播的最近一期马里《发展》周刊的社论，谴责帝国主义在非洲国家策动军事政变，企图阻挠非洲革命。
    社论说：“我们早已多次说过，帝国主义企图策划各种阴谋，资助所有的颠覆活动，挑起各种各样的分歧，来阻挠非洲革命，在非洲叛徒和那些能帮助它大发横财的人中找到策应者。对一连串的军事政变只能这样理解。”
    社论警告帝国主义及其仆从不要高兴得太早，“因为按照事物本身的辩证法，我们知道，这种局面是暂时的，是不能长久的。非洲各国人民不会不对帝国主义及其仆从制造的这种新的局面作出相应的反应。”
    社论接着说：“非洲人民已经充分动员起来。帝国主义者的阴险计划已经暴露，那就是：帝国主义总是企图推翻那些为使自己的国家摆脱不发达的深渊而作出真正努力的所有领导人，总是企图凶暴地毁掉人民群众的一切基本利益。”
    社论最后说，“我们整个大陆的非洲人民终将看到‘帝国主义彻底完蛋’。”
    新华社十二日讯　乔治敦消息：英属圭亚那一些群众团体最近在乔治敦举行加纳形势讨论会，强烈谴责美国和英国授意反动势力推翻恩克鲁玛政府的行径。
    参加讨论会的有几百人。民族复兴委员会、非洲人同独立非洲文化关系协会和非洲—亚洲—美洲协会等团体的领导人在发言中都谴责了加纳的军事政变。
    讨论会通过了一项决议，表示“全力支持非洲人民的解放运动以及把白人霸权政府、殖民主义和新殖民主义从整个非洲大陆扫除干净的斗争”。
    新华社仰光十二日电　缅甸著名作家杜阿玛十二日在《人民报》上发表文章指出，加纳政变是由美英帝国主义者策划的。
    她说：“非洲人民正在挣脱老殖民主义者的枷锁和建立独立的国家。在这个时候，帝国主义者又在怂恿他们的走狗在新独立的国家里发动政变，妄图执行他们的新殖民主义政策，对这些国家进行剥削和干涉。”
    她说：非洲人民必须趁帝国主义者及其走狗还没有巩固他们的地位之前把他们赶出去。
