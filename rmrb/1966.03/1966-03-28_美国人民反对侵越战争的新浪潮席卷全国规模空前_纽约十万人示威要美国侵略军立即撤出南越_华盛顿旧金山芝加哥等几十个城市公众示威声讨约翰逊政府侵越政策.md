    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The largest city in the United States—New York City—saw 100,000 members of the public hold an unprecedentedly massive protest demonstration and rally on the afternoon of the 26th, demanding that the Johnson government “immediately withdraw American troops (from Vietnam)!” “Stop the aggression!” “Immediately stop the Vietnam War!”
    This was the climax of the anti-aggression against Vietnam protest activities that have swept across the United States in the past two days, and also the largest-scale demonstration by the people against their own country’s imperialism in American history. The total number of participants in the demonstration almost doubled the original expected number of 35,000.
    The demonstration started at 1 p.m. and lasted almost the entire afternoon. The mighty demonstration procession marched along Fifth Avenue, New York’s most prosperous street, towards Central Park; along the way, people continuously joined the ranks of the marchers. Participants in the demonstration included not only young people, but also many elderly people, and mothers pushing strollers. A number of veterans wearing military caps participated in the demonstration, attracting particular attention. The placards held by the demonstrators read slogans such as: “Immediately withdraw American troops (from Vietnam)!” “Stop the aggression!” “Immediately stop the Vietnam War!” A group of black demonstrators also marched forward carrying the flag of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. All along the route of the procession, thousands of citizens crowded the sidewalks to watch. Some demonstrators distributed pamphlets opposing the war of aggression against Vietnam to onlookers.
    The authorities dispatched thousands of police officers, deploying dense sentry posts along the route of the procession. A small number of secret agent thugs and hooligans wantonly provoked the demonstrators, throwing stink bombs and tomatoes at them, using foul language, and even resorting to violence, but all of this could not stop the advance of the powerful demonstration procession.
    Subsequently, the demonstrating masses held a protest rally in the square of Central Park; many people spoke at the meeting, criticizing the Johnson government’s policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    On the same day, in the capital Washington, as well as dozens of large and small cities in the north, midwest, and south, including San Francisco, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Miami, and Nashville, anti-aggression against Vietnam protest waves were also widely launched, with demonstrations ranging from nearly a hundred to thousands of people participating.
    In Washington, more than 400 demonstrators held a march in front of the White House to protest the aggression against Vietnam, and then went to demonstrate in front of the U.S. "Embassy" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime. Demonstrators held placards demanding "America, get out of Vietnam!" "Withdraw the U.S. troops!" "Stop the slaughter!" and other slogans against the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    In San Francisco, an important city on the West Coast, more than 7,000 members of the public held a grand demonstration against the aggression against Vietnam on the 26th.
    In front of a recruiting station in Los Angeles, about 300 people also held a demonstration on this day. Their placards read: “Get out of Vietnam immediately!” “Stop the atrocities in Vietnam and Watts!” Some demonstrators also shouted: “Withdraw the troops from Vietnam!” On the evening of the 25th, more than 1,400 teachers and students from the Los Angeles campus of the University of California also held a 12-hour after-school lecture meeting against the government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    Although some cities in the Midwest had just experienced heavy snow, temperatures had plummeted, and the roads were muddy, these did not stop the public in these cities from taking to the streets to hold protest demonstrations. It is estimated that 6,000 and 3,000 people respectively participated in the demonstrations held in Detroit and Chicago on the 26th.
    In Cleveland, Ohio, more than 300 people braved sub-zero temperatures to hold a demonstration in the public square. Placards held by the demonstrators read: “Get out of Vietnam!” “Johnson, Johnson, how many children did you kill today?” In another city in this state, Dayton, 200 demonstrators marched to the post office to deliver protest letters to members of Congress against the government’s policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    From March 25th, the people of hundreds of American cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington, have continuously carried out unprecedented large-scale demonstrations against the war of aggression against Vietnam. Just as the Johnson government was desperately clamoring to fight the war of aggression against Vietnam to the end, millions of American people stood up and, from within the reactionary fortress of American imperialism, let out roars of anti-aggression that shook the earth. This is another heavy blow to the Johnson government, which is in internal and external difficulties and extremely isolated, and this is a great march by the courageous American people to attack American imperialism. The American people have united their just struggle with the struggle of the Vietnamese people and with the torrent of the world against American imperialism, and are constantly striking at the foundations of American imperialism. Their great struggle will surely achieve final victory. (Attached pictures)

    美国人民反对侵越战争的新浪潮席卷全国规模空前
    纽约十万人示威要美国侵略军立即撤出南越
    华盛顿旧金山芝加哥等几十个城市公众示威声讨约翰逊政府侵越政策
    据新华社二十七日讯  美国第一大城市——纽约市的十万公众二十六日下午举行声势空前浩大的抗议示威和集会，要求约翰逊政府“立即把美军
  （从越南）撤回来！”“停止侵略！”“立即停止越南战争！”
    这是两天来席卷美国各地的反对侵略越南的抗议活动的最高潮，同时也是美国有史以来规模最大的一次人民反对本国帝国主义的示威行动。示威参加者的总数比原来预期的三万五千人几乎超出了两倍。
    示威从下午一时开始，几乎延续了整整一下午。浩浩荡荡的示威队伍穿越纽约最繁华的五马路向中央公园行进；一路上都不断有人加入游行者的行列。参加示威的不仅有青年，而且有许多老年人，还有推着婴儿车的母亲。不少头戴军帽的退伍军人参加示威，特别引人注目。示威者举着的标语牌上写着：“立即把美军（从越南）撤回来！”“停止侵略！”“立即停止越南战争！”等口号。一批黑人示威者还打着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜前进。游行队伍经过的沿途，都有数以千计的市民拥挤在人行道上观看。一些示威者向路旁观众散发了反对侵越战争的小册子。
    当局出动了上千名警察，在游行队伍经过的一路上布下了密集的岗哨。一小撮特务打手和流氓分子向示威者肆意寻衅，向示威者投掷臭蛋和西红柿、骂下流话，甚至大打出手，但是这一切都不能阻挡强大的示威队伍前进。
    接着，示威群众在中央公园的广场上举行了抗议集会；会上有不少人发言抨击约翰逊政府的侵越政策。
    同一天，在首都华盛顿以及包括旧金山、底特律、芝加哥、波士顿、亚特兰大、迈阿密、纳什维尔在内的北部、中西部和南部的数十个大、小城市里也都广泛地掀起了反对侵越战争的抗议浪潮，分别举行了有近百人到数千人参加的示威游行。
    在华盛顿，四百多名示威者在白宫前面举行了抗议侵略越南的游行，接着又前往南越傀儡政权驻美“大使馆”门前示威。示威者举着要求“美国滚出越南！”“把美军撤回来！”“停止屠杀！”和其他反对侵越战争口号的标语牌。
    在西海岸的重要城市旧金山，二十六日有七千多公众举行了盛大的反对侵略越南的示威。
    在洛杉矶市内一处征兵站门前，这一天也有大约三百人举行了示威。他们的标语牌上写着：“立即滚出越南！”“停止在越南和瓦茨区的暴行！”有的示威者还高呼：“把军队撤出越南！”在二十五日晚上，加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶校部的一千四百多名师生还举行了持续十二小时的反对政府侵越政策的课余宣讲会。
    尽管中西部的一些城市刚刚下过大雪，气温陡降，道路泥泞，但是这些并不能阻挡这些城市的公众走上街头举行抗议示威。据估计，在底特律和芝加哥两个城市二十六日举行的示威中，分别有六千人和三千人参加。
    在俄亥俄州的克利夫兰，三百多人冒着零度以下的严寒在公共广场上举行了示威。示威者举着的标语牌上写道：“从越南撤出来！”“约翰逊，约翰逊，今天你杀害了多少儿童？”在这个州的另一城市德顿，有两百名示威者举行游行，前往邮局投递写给国会议员反对政府侵越政策的抗议信件。
    从三月二十五日起，纽约、旧金山、芝加哥、华盛顿等上百个美国城市的人民连续进行了规模空前的、反对侵越战争的大示威。正当约翰逊政府拼命叫嚷要把侵越战争打到底的时候，千千万万的美国人民站出来，从美帝国主义反动堡垒的内部，发出了震撼大地的反侵略的怒吼。这是对内外交困、十分孤立的约翰逊政府的又一个沉重打击，这是勇敢的美国人民向美帝国主义实行冲击的伟大进军。美国人民把他们的正义斗争同越南人民的斗争、同全世界反对美帝国主义的洪流汇合起来，不断打击着美帝国主义的基础。他们的伟大斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。（附图片）
