    The Days I Spent With the Dazhai People
    Beijing Scientific and Educational Film Studio Zhao Ying
    In February 1965, I accepted the task of writing and directing the film "Dazhai Fields." Dazhai is a red banner on the national agricultural front. Could a science and education film depict Dazhai? Could scientific principles and revolutionary fervor be integrated? I had no confidence in answering any of these questions.
    At this time, the leadership gave us important instructions: "To film Dazhai's science and education film, you must have both the people of Dazhai and the fields of Dazhai. Without the people of Dazhai, there would be no fields of Dazhai. However, the science and education film should focus on the scientific technologies of Dazhai's fields."
    The leadership's help made it clearer to me: fields are cultivated by people, land is transformed by people, and scientific technologies are summarized by people in production practices. To talk about the scientific technologies that created Dazhai's fields while ignoring the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people is clearly neglecting the primary importance of the human factor.
    I arrived at Dazhai Village in early February. The weather was very cold, and the ground was still frozen, but every day before dawn, cadres and commune members were already up in the mountains. Some were splitting mountains and filling gullies, some were building stone embankments, some were starting pens, chopping grass, composting fertilizer, and delivering manure... After dinner, commune members studied Chairman Mao's writings, current affairs, and culture. It was almost impossible to find a suitable time to approach them. Seeing how busy the Dazhai people were, I thought it would be better to look at Dazhai's fields first. I climbed Kangjia Ridge Mountain, where I saw several commune members carrying baskets of furnace ash to the fields. I asked curiously, "Doesn't applying furnace ash to the fields damage the soil?" "This is red soil, sticky soil. Applying furnace ash can loosen the soil." "Just furnace ash?" "No, we also apply manure." Later, I learned that the person I was talking to was Jia Chengyun, who was very experienced in farming. I then ran to the Quanshuiwa area, where I saw several female commune members carrying baskets of soil to the fields. I asked, very curious, "Auntie, what's the deal with applying soil on top of soil?" She replied, "This isn't soil, it's sheep manure. This is sandy land, with more sand than soil, so crops don't grow well. We need to apply soil manure to improve the soil." Standing in Quanshuiwa and looking diagonally across, a winding "Great Wall" appeared in the distance. I couldn't help but ask, "What is that, like the Great Wall?" "That's the ridge land of Mailingzhai, the bright, bare thing is the earthen embankment." It turned out that the Dazhai people had built earthen embankments on the ridge land. Smooth, solid, and bright earthen embankments like walls formed a "Great Wall" to conserve water and resist drought. The hillside was layered with neat terraced fields, with sturdy stone embankments along the edges, and stone dams along the gully land. These were all measures to conserve water, soil, and fertilizer. At that moment, I thought to myself: Dazhai has both vigor and science. I thank the commune members for giving me a science lesson.
    A week passed, and my mind was filled with the heroic deeds of the Dazhai people farming for the revolution and various scientific measures. For example, the Three Battles of Langwozhang, the Three Trials of Phosphate Fertilizer, the Three Deep Method of corn planting, and the "Three No's" and "Three No Reductions" proposed after the 1963 disaster. It was like a catalog, arranged in my initial impressions.
    Time was pressing. The script had to be finished by the end of February, otherwise, the filming season would be missed. However, there was little to see in February. To write about the situation throughout the four seasons, it was impossible to watch for a year and then write. Even if I really watched for a year and wrote it, it might not be usable. Comrade Chen Yonggui had said: The collective economy has new methods every year, one change per year, and revolution is about replacing the old with the new. What if the situation changes? This made me very distressed. I thought of what Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": A person's knowledge has two sources, one is from their own practice, and the other is from other people's accounts or books. Chairman Mao's teachings made me realize that, to reflect Dazhai in a timely manner, in addition to participating in labor and experiencing it firsthand, I must also deeply understand the production practices of the Dazhai people and the scientific practices of the scientific workers. The Dazhai people have rich production knowledge and scientific knowledge. The scientific workers living here have systematically summarized the scientific achievements of the Dazhai people's farming. With Chen Yonggui personally serving as the technical advisor for the film and agronomist Xu Yuntian serving as the scientific consultant, as long as I learn deeply from all aspects and take the path of three combinations in the writing work, the work can be successful.
    With everyone's help, the script was finally written. In order to capture the production shots that were highly seasonal, filming had to begin simultaneously with reviewing the script. At this time, the Dazhai people were rushing to repair the land, fearing that missing the season would affect planting. We were rushing to film shots, also fearing that missing the season would delay the film's release. Filming and production were in conflict. Dazhai's labor force was not large, but the filming work could not be separated from people and the land. Filming also required attention to lighting, angles, scenes, and the emotions of the laborers. Sometimes, the angle was selected, and the commune members arrived, but the sky became overcast, and filming was impossible. We had to wait. After waiting for a long time, the sun came out, but the light changed, and the original angle could not be used. We had to find a new one. This inevitably meant moving the commune members from this plot of land to that plot of land, and from that plot of land to another plot of land... Moving the commune members back and forth took a lot of time, which affected production. What to do? This was a real problem. Later, when Comrade Chen Yonggui learned about it, he proactively said to us, "Don't have any worries. The situation in 1965 is much better than in 1964. The land has basically recovered. We have the strength to cooperate with you." He introduced us to the situation in Dazhai over the past ten years and frankly pointed out the shortcomings of the script. He also personally took us to Langwozhang to choose filming locations. All the comrades in the Party branch came to see us; all the commune members were responsive to our requests. This enthusiastic help gave us strength. But then I thought, we cannot endlessly accept the support of the Dazhai people. The fundamental solution to the conflict is how we can better coordinate with production. Otherwise, if the filming takes too long and occupies too much manpower, it will cause losses to production. This would not be a science and education film serving production, but production serving the science and education film! Therefore, we implemented working methods such as two learnings, two helps, three worships, three diligences, and three simultaneities. The two learnings were: learn Chairman Mao's writings, learn the Dazhai spirit; the two helps were: help each other with ideology, help each other with work; the three worships were: worship commune members as teachers, worship cadres as teachers, worship scientific workers as teachers; the three diligences were: be diligent with your mouth, ask questions if you don't understand, and use what you understand; be diligent with your legs, climb the mountains frequently to become familiar with the terrain and plots, and familiarize yourself with filming angles; be diligent with your hands, prepare quickly, film quickly, quickly pack up the machines after filming, and quickly participate in labor; the three simultaneities were: write, film, and revise simultaneously. At the same time, when we encountered intermittently sunny and cloudy weather, we made decisive decisions whether to film or not, so as not to make the commune members wait and delay production.
    We also changed the past negative attitude of only participating in labor on cloudy days and only filming on sunny days. Every day, all the comrades in the team not only carried the machines, but also carried labor tools to the fields, combining filming and participation in labor. In this way, we had more opportunities to contact the commune members, became more familiar with production, and became more familiar with each other in joint labor. The opportunities to talk heart-to-heart also increased. Each time we talked heart-to-heart, our understanding of the people and things in Dazhai deepened. After a period of time, we wrote down everything we saw and heard from the Dazhai people, and after analysis and research, we incorporated them into the film. For example, the scene of Chen Yonggui educating the youth, Jia Jincai's working hands, the working hands of the Dazhai people, etc. There were also some relatively lively mass languages, such as: "In the past, some people said that there is no skill in farming, just have fertilizer; skillful plowing and planting is not as good as lazy people applying manure." But the Dazhai people say: "Farming requires skill, using both hands and brains; lazy people applying manure is not as good as rational fertilization." Or: "Red soil is very sticky, with poor ventilation and water permeability; when it dries, it's like a knife, and when it's wet, it's a lump of goo." "Sandy soil has good ventilation and water permeability, but it doesn't retain water and fertilizer well; with more sand and less soil, crops don't grow well." These languages from the masses powerfully helped us in the treatment of the shots, allowing us to handle the static shots of soil and fertilizer more lively and vividly.
    In 1965, the crops in the Dazhai fields grew even better than in 1964. The seedlings emerged most completely. We often estimated the year's harvest with the Dazhai people. Although we temporarily used ×× to replace the yield figures in the script, we thought in our hearts: the yield per mu must exceed a thousand catties, and we must be able to capture the scene of a bumper harvest. Who knew that from the time of sowing in April to July, there had not been a single thorough rain. In June, the scorching sun shone from morning to night, and the seedlings in the fields dried up and curled their leaves. On July 19, the weather suddenly changed. A strong wind howled, and dark clouds covered the sky. The eagerness to see rain made many people run out to look at the sky. However, a torrential rain fell, and the concentrated rainwater brought mountain floods, destroying dozens of mu of land. The seedlings we had carefully selected to film were also washed away. After the rain, the Dazhai people, barefoot in the muddy fields, rebuilt embankments and supported the seedlings. They had almost no pessimistic or disappointed emotions. On August 19, another hailstorm occurred, and the corn leaves were beaten to a pulp. From September 4 to 5, a strong wind blew for a day and a night, blowing the almost ripe grain all over the ground. The Dazhai fields were subjected to various disasters one after another: drought, flood, wind, and hail. What would the yield be? How would the "Dazhai Fields" film continue? We were really sad and anxious.
    Later, the leaders of the Xiyang County Party Committee learned about our distress and said to us, "Although Dazhai has suffered disasters, according to our investigations, the yield will not be too low. You can film the disaster situation, film the Dazhai people's disaster relief actions, and film the various crops on the ground. This can further explain why the Dazhai people and Dazhai fields can withstand the test of disasters, and the educational significance will be even greater." These few concise and powerful instructions awakened me. Dazhai had clearly suffered disasters, but we still insisted on filming the scene of favorable weather. This unrealistic idea prevented us from filming all the real disaster situations; nor did we film all the various revolutionary actions of the Dazhai people in the face of the disaster, guided by Mao Zedong Thought. For example, in the face of the disaster, they proposed: difficult conditions cannot defeat them, great achievements cannot elate them, severe disasters cannot scare them, high honors cannot flatter them, and unhealthy tendencies cannot blow them down. In the most difficult moments, they seized the time to study Chairman Mao's writings, especially the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which they studied countless times. More importantly, they learned and applied it, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide practical actions and taking a series of measures to deal with the disaster. We also did not truthfully film all of these. Later, although we salvaged some of it with remedial measures, some of the main content, such as the scene of the Dazhai people supporting the seedlings one by one after they were washed down, and some other moving scenes, could not be filmed because we missed the opportunity.
    In mid-September, we were once again involved in the autumn harvest filming work. Because we corrected our shortcomings and improved our methods, the work progressed relatively smoothly. We also added some shots of the main scientific basis for why the Dazhai fields can resist disasters -- the "sponge field" measures.
    When the commune member congress announced the yield of 796 catties per mu, we and all the Dazhai people were so happy that we couldn't sleep. After the commune member congress, the Dazhai people reviewed the sample film of "Dazhai Fields." Comrade Chen Yonggui and the Dazhai commune members gave us great encouragement. An 80-year-old poor peasant woman said to me, "I haven't been to the fields for 20 years. When I was young, I went to every plot of land, but that was working for the landlord. The land at that time was all small strips and small plots; there were more stones than soil. After watching the movie, I realized how much it has changed. Look how good the land is, the earthen embankments are bright and shiny, the stone dams are neatly arranged. This is because our Dazhai people listened to Chairman Mao's words that we have today!" The Dazhai people love Chairman Mao in everything. They read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Over the past year, these ideas have strongly infected me, making me further realize that we filmmakers can only truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialist construction if we honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words and integrate well with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

### 和大寨人在一起的日子

    和大寨人在一起的日子
    北京科学教育电影制片厂　赵莹
    一九六五年二月，我接受了《大寨田》影片的编导任务。大寨是全国农业战线上的一面红旗。科教片能不能表现大寨，科学与革命干劲是否可以融合为一体？一连串的疑问，我心里一点数也没有。
    这时，上级领导给了我们重要的指示：“拍大寨的科教片，既要有大寨人，又要有大寨田，没有大寨人就没有大寨田。但科学教育片应该着重表现大寨田的科学技术。”
    领导的帮助，使我进一步明确了：田是人种的，地是人整的，科学技术是人在生产实践中总结出来的。离开大寨人的革命干劲，只谈大寨田建成的科学技术，显然是忽视了人的因素第一。
    二月上旬到了大寨村。这里天气很冷，地还冻着，可是每天天不亮干部和社员们都上山了。他们有的劈山填沟，有的开石垒坝，有的在起圈、切草、沤肥、送粪……。晚饭后，社员们学毛主席著作，学时事、文化，简直找不到一个合适的时间去接近他们。看到大寨人这么忙，我想，还是先看看大寨的地吧。我爬上康家岭山，这时有几个社员正在挑着几筐炉灰往地里倒，我奇怪地问：“地里上炉灰，不破坏土壤吗？”“这是红土壤，粘性土壤，上炉灰能松土。”“光上炉灰？”“不，还要上粪”。后来我才知道和我说话的人，就是种地很有经验的贾承运。我又跑到泉水洼地方，看见几个女社员挑着一筐筐土往地里倒。我又很新奇地问：“大嫂，这土上又上土是怎么回事？”她回答说：“这不是土，是土羊粪。这是沙性地，沙多土少，庄稼长不好，要上土粪改土。”站在泉水洼往斜对面看去，一道蜿蜒的“万里长城”出现在远方。我不由得又问：“那是什么，好象万里长城似的？”“那是麦岭寨的岭梁地，明晃晃、光光的是土堾（土堰）。”原来在岭梁地上，大寨人都修了土堰。光滑、结实、明晃晃象墙一样的土堰连成了一道保水抗旱的“万里长城”。山坡上是一层层整齐的梯田，田边都有坚固的石堾（石堰），节节沟地上都有条条石坝。这些都是保持水、土、肥的措施。这时我暗暗想：大寨有干劲也有科学。我感谢社员们给我上了一堂科学课。
    一个星期过去了，脑子里装了很多大寨人为革命种田的各种英雄事迹和各种科学措施。例如：三战狼窝掌、三试磷肥、玉米三深法等，以及一九六三年遭灾后提出的“三不要”、“三不减”等。它就象一本目录，排列在最初的印象中。
    时间赶得紧，二月底必须写完剧本，不然就要耽误拍摄季节。但二月份能看到的东西很少，要写一年四季的情况，又不可能看上一年再写。就是真的看了一年写出来了，也不一定能用。陈永贵同志就说过：集体经济年年都有新套套，一年一个样，革命就是去旧换新。情况变了怎么办？这使我很苦恼。我想毛主席在《实践论》里说过：一个人的知识有两个来源，一个是自己实践得来的，另一个是通过别人口述或书本得来的。毛主席的教导使我认识到，要想及时反映大寨，除了自己参加劳动亲身体验外，还必须深入了解大寨人的生产实践和科学工作者的科学实践。大寨人有丰富的生产知识、科学知识；住在这里的科学工作者又系统地总结了大寨人种田的科学成果。又有陈永贵亲自担任本片的技术指导，农学家许运天担任科学顾问，只要深入地从各方面学习，在编写工作上走三结合的道路，工作是能够取得胜利的。
    在大家的帮助下，剧本终于写出来了。为了拍下季节性极强的生产镜头，必须边审查剧本，边抢拍镜头。这时大寨人正抢修土地，怕误了季节影响下种，而我们抢拍镜头，也是怕误了季节，耽误出片。拍电影和生产有了矛盾。大寨的劳动力是不多的，但拍摄工作一时一刻也离不开人和地，在拍摄中还要讲光线、角度、场面和劳动者的情绪等等。有时选好角度，社员也来齐了，可是天阴了，不能拍，只好等着。等了半天太阳出来了，光线又起了变化，原来的角度不能拍了，只好重新另找。这就不得不把社员从这块地调到那块地，从那块地又调到另一块地……把社员调来调去，就要花费不少时间，以致影响生产。怎么办？这真是一个难题。后来陈永贵同志知道了，就主动对我们说：“你们不要有顾虑，一九六五年的情况比一九六四年好得多，土地基本上恢复了，我们有力量配合你们。”他给我们介绍了大寨十几年的情况，并且坦率地指出了剧本的缺点，还亲自带我们到狼窝掌选择拍摄地点。党支部全体同志来看我们；全村社员对我们有求必应。这种热情的帮助，使我们增加了力量。但转念一想，我们不能无止境地接受大寨人的支援。解决矛盾的根本问题，是我们如何跟生产配合好，否则因拍摄时间太长，占用人力过多，将会给生产造成损失，这就不是科教片为生产服务，而是生产为科教片服务了！因此，我们实行了两学、两帮、三拜、三勤、三边等工作方法。两学是：学习毛主席著作，学习大寨精神；两帮是：互相帮思想、互相帮工作；三拜是：拜社员为老师、拜干部为老师、拜科学工作者为老师；三勤是：嘴勤，不懂就问，懂了就用；腿勤，勤爬山熟悉地形和地块，熟悉拍摄角度；手勤，准备工作做的快，拍的快，拍完了快收机器，快参加劳动；三边是：边写、边拍、边修改。与此同时，碰上时晴时阴的天气，我们也当机立断，拍与不拍赶快决定，不要叫社员等着，以免耽误生产。
    我们还改变了以往只有阴天才参加劳动，晴天光拍电影不参加劳动的消极态度。全组同志每天不但扛着机器，而且还扛着劳动工具下地，拍电影和参加劳动结合起来进行。这样，我们接触社员的机会多了，熟悉生产的面更宽了，在共同劳动中，大家越来越熟悉了，谈心的机会也增多了。谈一次心，我们对大寨的人和事的了解就更深一层。经过一段时期，我们把从大寨人那里看到的、听到的都记了下来，经过分析研究，把它们充实到影片中去了。如：陈永贵教育青年的镜头，贾进财的劳动的手，大寨人的劳动的手等镜头。还有一些比较生动活泼的群众语言，如：“过去有人说，种地无巧，有肥就好；能耕巧种，不如懒汉上粪”。可是大寨人说：“种地需要巧，动手又动脑，懒汉上粪不如合理施肥”，又如：“红土地，粘性大，通气透水条件差，干了就象一把刀，湿了就是一包糟”，“沙土地，通气透水倒是好，就是水肥双不保，沙多、土少，庄稼长不好。”这些来自群众中的语言，有力地帮助了我们对镜头的处理，使我们把静止的土壤和肥料等镜头处理得比较活泼生动。
    一九六五年，大寨田里的庄稼长的比一九六四年还要好，苗苗出的最全，我们常和大寨人一起估计着当年的收成。我们在剧本上虽然暂时用××来代替产量数字，但心里却想着：亩产一定过千斤，我们一定可以把丰收景象拍摄下来。那知从四月下种后到七月，一直没有下过一场透雨。六月份火辣辣的太阳，从早到晚晒个不停，地里的苗苗干得卷起了叶子。七月十九日天气突变，疾风呼啸，阴云密布，等雨盼雨的心情使不少人跑出来看天，可是下了一场暴雨，集中的雨水带来了山洪，几十亩地被冲坏了，我们早就选好要拍的苗苗也冲坏了。雨后，大寨人赤着脚在泥泞的地里，又是垒坝又是扶苗。他们简直没有一点悲观失望的情绪。八月十九日，又下了一场冰雹，玉米叶子打了个稀烂。九月四日到五日，刮了一天一夜的大风，将要成熟的谷子刮了满地。大寨田接二连三遭到了旱、洪、风、雹各种灾害，产量会怎样呢？《大寨田》影片又如何进行下去呢？我们真是又难过又着急。
    后来昔阳县委领导同志知道了我们的苦恼，对我们说：“大寨虽然受了灾，根据我们调查的情况看，产量不会过低。你们可以把灾情拍下来，把大寨人抗灾的行动拍下来，把各种地上的庄稼拍下来，这样能进一步说明大寨人和大寨田为什么能经受住灾情的考验，教育意义也更大。”这几句简练有力的指示，使我醒悟过来。大寨明明遭受了灾害，我们还偏偏想拍风调雨顺的景象。这种脱离实际的想法，使我们没有把所有真实的灾情全部拍摄下来；也没有把大寨人面对灾情、用毛泽东思想指导的各种革命行动全部拍摄下来。例如：他们面对灾情提出了：条件坏难不倒，成绩大喜不倒，灾害重吓不倒，荣誉高夸不倒，歪风邪气吹不倒。在最困难的时刻，他们抓紧时间学习毛主席著作，特别是《愚公移山》这一篇，不知学过多少次。更主要的是他们学了就用，以毛泽东思想指导实际行动，对灾情采取了一系列的措施。对这些，我们也没有如实地全部拍摄下来。以后，虽然用补救的办法抢拍了一些，但有些主要内容，如苗苗被冲倒后，大寨人把它们一棵棵扶起的场面，以及其他一些动人的场面，都因错过时机，无法拍摄了。
    九月中旬，我们又投入了秋收拍摄工作。由于我们纠正了缺点，改进了方法，工作进行得比较顺利。并且还增拍了一些大寨田为什么能抗灾的主要科学根据——“海绵地”的措施等镜头。
    当社员大会公布了亩产七百九十六斤时，我们和全体大寨人，高兴得睡不着觉。社员大会以后，大寨人审查了《大寨田》影片的样片。陈永贵同志和大寨社员们给了我们很大的鼓励。一位八十岁的贫农老大娘对我说：“我二十年没有下过地了，年青的时候哪块地都去过，那是给地主干活。那时的地，都是小条条、小块块；多见石头，少见土。看了电影，才知道变化这么大。看那地好的呀，土堾（堰）明晃晃光亮亮的，石坝齐格楞楞的。这是咱大寨人听了毛主席的话，才有了今天呀！”大寨人，处处热爱毛主席。他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。一年来，这些思想强烈地感染着我，使我进一步体会到：我们搞电影工作的人，也只有老老实实听毛主席的话，很好地同工农兵结合，才能使电影真正为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务。
