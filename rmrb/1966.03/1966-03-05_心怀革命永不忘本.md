    Always Remember the Revolution and Never Forget Our Roots
    Xini Wande (Mongolian), Deputy Secretary of the Ulan County Party Committee, Qinghai

    Comrade Jiao Yulu came from a poor peasant family, and I also came from a poor herdsman family. He could always think of the poor and lower-middle peasants in everything he did, but I have not done as well in this regard. The conditions in our Ulan County are better than those in Lankao, but our work is not as good as Lankao's. The main reason is the lack of Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, and the lack of revolutionized thinking. Without revolutionized thinking, we cannot do our work well. For example, the Chaka Commune has achieved good results by studying Chairman Mao's works extensively and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the masses. However, our county party committee did not quickly promote Chaka's experience throughout the county, which shows that our measures are weak, our actions are slow, and there is a tendency toward generalized leadership.

    In the future, whether I am working in the office or in the yurt, I will bring Chairman Mao's works with me, study and apply them in light of reality, so that I can truly become a proletarian fighter worthy of the name. I will strive to do my work well, keep the world in mind while staying in Ulan, and establish revolutionary ambitions. In the future, I will be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, highlighting politics, keeping the word "revolution" in my heart, and using Chairman Mao's stand, viewpoint, and method to look at and deal with all problems. I will forever share weal and woe with the poor herdsmen, and completely change the face of Ulan.

    心怀革命永不忘本
    青海乌兰县委副书记　希尼万德（蒙古族）
    焦裕禄同志是贫农家庭出身，我也是贫苦牧民出身。他能时时事事为贫农下中农着想，而我这方面却做得差。我们乌兰县的条件比兰考好，可是工作不如兰考。主要原因是缺乏焦裕禄同志的革命精神，缺乏革命化的思想。没有革命化的思想就做不好工作。如茶卡公社抓了大学毛主席著作，发挥了群众的干劲，做出了较好的成绩。但是我们县委没有把茶卡的经验很快地推广到全县，说明我们的措施不力，行动不快，存在着领导一般化的作风。
    今后，我不论在机关办公，或者下帐房工作，都要带上毛主席著作，结合实际，边学边用，使自己真正成为一个名副其实的无产阶级战士。努力做好工作，身在乌兰，眼看世界，树立革命的雄心壮志。今后要象焦裕禄同志那样，突出政治，心怀“革命”二字，用毛主席的立场、观点、方法去看待一切问题，处理一切问题。永远和贫苦牧民同甘共苦，彻底改变乌兰面貌。
