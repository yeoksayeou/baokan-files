    In discussions concerning the Hai Rui issue, some comrades' papers have cited a passage from Marx's "Debates on the Law on Thefts of Wood" from October 1842 (《Marx Engels Collected Works》, Volume 1, People's Publishing House, 1965 edition, page 135 onwards) regarding customary rights (laws) as a basis for distinguishing the behavior of "upright officials." I feel this quote is not comprehensive or appropriate enough. The inappropriate citation is partly due to the fact that some paragraphs and phrases of the original text have not been translated accurately or clearly enough. In order to clarify Marx's original intention, I have checked the passage concerning customary rights (laws) in the book against the original text, and made some modifications to certain key phrases that I believe are more in line with the original meaning. I am now copying the relevant paragraphs below, and also putting forward some of my understanding of Marx's long passage, for reference in everyone's discussions.

    Marx said in this debate:

        But we, the unpractical people, want to uphold the rights of the politically and socially oppressed poor masses, and expose the fabrications of those obsequious so-called historians, who treat this stuff as the real philosopher's stone in order to turn all dirty desires into pure gold of law. We demand customary rights for the poor, not limited to the customary rights of a certain place, but the customary rights inherent in the poor of all countries. We further believe that customary rights, in their essence, can only be the rights of this lowest, most impoverished natural mass.

    The customs of the so-called privileged are habits that contradict the law. These habits originated in an era when human history was still part of natural history, when, according to Egyptian legends, all the gods appeared in the form of animals. Humanity is like splitting into many different kinds of animal groups, and the relationship between them is not equality, but inequality fixed by law. The unfree era of the world demands unfree laws; because human law embodies freedom, while this animal law, on the contrary, embodies unfreedom. ...The same is true under feudalism, where one kind of person lives off another kind of person, the latter being like a hydra attached to the shore, with only many hands to pick the fruits of the land for the former, while living off dust themselves; because if worker bees kill drones in the natural animal world, then in the spiritual animal world, the opposite is true, the drones kill the worker bees – tormenting them to death with work. When the privileged appeal to their customary rights from legal rights, they are not demanding the human content of the law, but the animal form of the law, which has now become purely an animal mask.

    The customary rights of the aristocracy, in terms of their content, are opposed to the form of universal law. They cannot be made into the form of law, because they are formations in a state of lawlessness. These customary rights are opposed to the legal form and its generality and necessity, which in itself shows that they are illegal rights of custom. Therefore, they cannot be opposed to the law, but can only be abolished as an antithesis to the law, and sometimes even punished, because a person's behavior does not cease to be unlawful just because it is his habit, just as a robber's son's robbery is not excusable because it is a family tradition. If a person deliberately breaks the law, then it is this knowing violation that should be punished; if he breaks the law out of habit, then it is this bad habit that should be punished. In an era where universal laws exist, reasonable customary rights are also the customs prescribed by statutory law, because a right does not cease to be a custom because it is enacted into law, it is only no longer purely a custom. For a person with legal rights, the law (right) becomes his own habit; this law will be enforced against those who have no legal rights, even if it is not the latter's habit. The fact that a right (law) is a right (law) does not depend on the accidental fact that the custom is reasonable; on the contrary, a custom becomes reasonable because the right is enacted into law, because the custom has become a habit of the state.

    Therefore, as a separate field existing alongside statutory law, customary law (right) is only reasonable when this law (right) exists outside the law, that is, only when the custom is a foreshadowing of statutory law. Therefore, there is no such thing as the customary rights of the privileged classes. In the law, the privileged classes not only have their reasonable rights recognized, but their unreasonable desires are often also recognized. The privileged classes have no right to demand anything outside the law, because the law has foreseen all the possible effects of their rights. Therefore, they demand these possible effects only as a field of menusplaisirs (Note: small pleasures, perks), the purpose of which is to allow the same content, which has been defined in its reasonable limits in the law, to be further developed in their habits and desires outside the reasonable scope.

    If the customary rights of the aristocracy are habits that contradict the concept of reasonable law (right), then the customary rights of the poor are opposed to the habits of current law. What the content of the latter opposes is not the form of statutory law, but rather its own lack of form. The form of law does not exist in opposition to it, but it has not yet acquired this form. ...

    The most liberal legislation, in terms of private rights, is limited to formulating the form for existing rights and elevating it to universal law. Where there is no right, this form is not formulated. ...

    This legislation cannot but be one-sided, because any customary right of the poor, as we see in all the institutions of the Middle Ages, is based on the instability of certain ownership. It cannot be absolutely certain whether it belongs to private property or public property, it is a mixture of private law and public law. The tool used by legislation to recognize this dual form is reason; and reason is not only one-sided in itself, its main function is to make the world one-sided – this is a great and admirable work, because only one-sidedness can pick out the special thing from the inorganic slurry and give it a certain form. The nature of things is the product of reason. Everything must isolate itself and split into isolated things in order to become what it must become. Reason puts every content of the world into a fixed scope and solidifies this flowing content into fossils, thereby showing the diversity of the world, because without these numerous one-sidednesses, the world would not be multifaceted.

    Therefore, reason applied the existing categories in abstract private law (the format of which is seen in Roman law), eliminating this duality and unstable form of ownership. Since the legislator's reason has abolished its own state privileges, it also believes that it is more reasonable to abolish the responsibility of this unstable ownership to the poor. However, it has forgotten that, even from a purely private law perspective, there are also two kinds of private rights (laws), the private rights (laws) of the possessors and the private rights (laws) of the non-possessors, not to mention that no legislation has ever abolished the state privileges of ownership, only removed the nature of the arbitrary behavior of these privileges, and endowed them with civil nature. All forms of rights in the Middle Ages, including ownership, are dual, binary, and split in all aspects, and reason righteously uses its unified principle to oppose this contradictory regulation, but reason still ignores one situation, that is, some objects of ownership can never have the nature of private property that has already been recognized, and because the original nature of the former and its accidental existence only belong to the scope of preemption, that is, to the scope of preemption of such a class, this class is precisely because of this preemption is excluded from any other ownership, its position in civil society is the same as the position of those objects of ownership in the natural world. ...

    It can be seen from this that there is an instinctive sense of rights in the customs of the poor, the roots of these customary rights are positive and legitimate, and customary law (right) is even more natural here, because the existence of the poor themselves is still only a habit of civil society, and this habit has not yet found its proper place in the state's conscious division."

    From Marx's long passage above, I think there are four points that should be pointed out:

   (1) What Marx wants to expose here is mainly the false appearance of the universal form of bourgeois law, which has evolved from the German feudal society, that covers up the bestiality of the privileged class. This is exactly the situation shown by the general law of Germany when the *Rheinische Zeitung* launched a debate on the law on thefts of wood at that time. Here, Marx did not want to focus on revealing the tragic fate suffered by the working people of medieval Europe under the arbitrary, tyrannical, and cruel feudal legal system.

      (2) In the debate exposing the essence of the law on thefts of wood, Marx was undoubtedly upholding the rights of the poor class (the customary rights of the poor). However, in Marx's early works, there were indeed some remnants of natural law and natural rights concepts. Moreover, at that time, Marx was conducting the debate under the rule of the German Junker landlord bourgeoisie, and in the debate, he had to start from the situation of the current local law of Prussia to expose and criticize, which is also understandable.

      (3) Marx repeatedly pointed out in the above passage that the customary rights of the privileged classes are nothing but the manifestation of the bestial rights of the exploiters' bloody suppression and cruel oppression of the working people's blood and sweat since class society. It is "illegal" and unreasonable; here, by illegal, Marx means violating the humanistic concept of law.

    But Marx clearly pointed out that the entire content of these so-called customary rights of the privileged classes, whether reasonable or unreasonable, including all their possible effects, has been entirely foreseen in the law of the privileged classes. He said: "They have no right to demand anything outside the law." He pointed out that "there is no such thing as the customary rights of the privileged classes here at all"; if there is anything else, it can only be some extra enjoyment of the privileged classes.

      (4) But I think the most important point of Marx's long passage is: if we want to talk about the contradictions reflected in the law of the exploiting class, point out its dual nature, and divide it into two, then it can only be the contradiction between "the private rights (laws) of the possessors and the private rights (laws) of the non-possessors"; this contradiction, as Marx said, has been unified by the "reason" of the privileged class legislators, that is, unified on the side of affirming the exploitation system and maintaining the interests of the privileged classes. The customary rights of the poor class cannot be recognized and affirmed in any legal form under the rule of the exploiting class.

    Based on the above opinions, I think that from what Marx said in "Debates on the Law on Thefts of Wood," no theoretical basis can be derived to explain the conceptual difference between "upright officials" and "corrupt officials" or local tyrants and bullies in Chinese feudal society.

    谈马克思关于两种权利的一段话及其译文
    申徒
    在有关海瑞问题的讨论中，有些同志的论文曾经引用一八四二年十月马克思《关于林木盗窃法的辩论》（《马克思恩格斯全集》第一卷，人民出版社一九六五年版，第一三五页以下）中有关习惯权利
  （法）的一段文字，以之作为辨析“清官”行为的根据。我觉得这段话引得不太全面、不太恰当。引用不当，部分原因可能是原文的某些段落和词句翻译得不够确切或不够明确。为了弄清楚马克思的原意，我把书中谈到习惯权利
  （法）的那一段，同原文前后进行了核对，对某些关键性词句作了一些我认为较合原意的修改。现在把有关段落抄录于后，并把我理解马克思这一大段话所得的几点意见一并提出，供大家讨论时的参考。
    马克思在这篇辩论中说：
        但是我们这些不实际
    的人却要为政治上和社会上备受压迫的贫苦群众伸张权利，揭露那些卑躬屈节唯命是听的所谓历史学家们所捏造出来的东西，他们把这种东西当做真正的哲人之石，以便把一切肮脏的欲求点成法之纯金。我们为穷人要求习惯权利，并不是限于某个地方的习惯权利，而是一切国家的穷人所固有的习惯权利。我们更进一步认为，习惯权利按其本质来说只能是这一最低下的、一无所有的自然群众的权利。
    所谓特权者的习惯是和法相抵触的习惯。这些习惯产生于人类史还是自然史的一部分的时代，当时根据埃及的传说，所有的神都以动物的形象出现。人类就象分裂成许多不同种的动物群，决定他们之间的关系的不是平等，而是法律所固定的不平等。世界上不自由的时代要求不自由的法；因为人类法体现着自由，而这种动物的法与之相反，却体现着不自由。……在封建制度下也是这样，一种人靠另一种人为生，后者象附在岸土上的水螅一样，它只有许多只手，为上种人拣取土地的果实，而自身却靠尘土为生；因为如果说在自然动物界中工蜂杀死雄蜂，则在精神动物界中，恰恰相反是雄蜂杀死工蜂——用工作把它们折磨死。当特权者从法定权利向其习惯权利作呼吁时，则他们所要求的不是法的人类内容，而是法的动物形态，后者现在实际上已变成纯粹是动物的假面具了。
    贵族的习惯权利按其内容说是与普遍法律的形式相对抗的。它们不能制成法律的形式，因为它们是无法状态下的形成物。这些习惯权利同法律形式及其一般性和必要性相对抗，这一点本身就说明它们是习惯的非法权利。因此，不能以之与法律相对抗，而只能作为法律的对抗物加以废除，甚至有时还要加以惩罚，因为一个人的行为方式并不因为这是他的习惯而不再是不法的行为，正如强盗儿子的抢劫行为并不因为是家风而可以原谅一样。如果一个人故意犯法，那末应该惩罚的是这种明知故犯；如果他犯法是由于习惯，那就应该惩罚他的这种不良习惯。在存在着普遍法律的时代，合理的习惯权利也就是制定法所规定的习惯，因为权利并不因为被制定为法律而不再是习惯，它只不再单纯是习惯罢了。对于一个有合法权利的人，法（权利）成为他自己的习惯；这个法将对没有合法权利的人贯彻执行，尽管它不是后者的习惯。权利（法）之为权利（法），并不取决于习惯是否合理这个偶然事实；相反，习惯成为合理的，却是因为权利被制定为法，因为习惯已成为国家的习惯。
    因此，作为同制定法并存的一种各别领域，习惯法（权利）只在这个法（权利）并存于法律之外，即只在习惯是制定法的一种预示的场合，才是合理的。因此，根本谈不到什么特权阶级的习惯权利。在法律里，特权阶级不仅使他们的合理权利得到承认，而且他们的不合理欲求甚至也还经常得到承认。特权阶级没有权利在法律之外还要求什么，因为法律已把他们权利的一切可能效果都预计在内了。因此，他们要求这些可能效果，这也只是作为menusplaisirs（注：小乐趣，外快）的领域，其目的是使法律里已按其合理界限加以规定的同一内容，在习惯里在合理范围之外使他们的癖好和欲求得到更多的发挥余地而已。
    如果说贵族的习惯权利是一些和合理法（权利）概念相抵触的习惯，则贫民的习惯权利是同现行法的习惯相对抗的。后者的内容所对抗的不是制定法的形式，它所对抗的毋宁是它自身的缺乏形式。法的形式倒不是同它对立并存，而是它还没有获得这个形式。……
    最自由的立法，在私权方面，只限于为现存的权利制定其形式，把它提升为普遍的法律。在没有权利的场合，也就不去制定这种形式。……
    这些立法不可能不是片面的，因为贫民的任何习惯权利，正象我们在中世纪一切制度中所看到的那样，是以一定的所有权的不固定性为基础的。它究竟是属于私有财产或公共财产，都不能绝对肯定，它是一种私法和公法的混合物。立法工作用以认识这种二重形态的工具就是理智；而理智不但本身是片面的，它的主要作用就是在于使世界成为片面的，——这真是一件伟大而令人赞叹的工作，因为只有片面性才会从无机的稀糊中拣出那特殊的东西而给予它以一定的形式。事物的性质是理智的产物。每一种东西要成为什么东西，必须把自己孤立起来，分裂成为孤立的东西。理智把世界的每一内容纳入一种固定的范围，并把这一流动的内容凝结成为化石，从而表明世界的多样性，因为没有这些众多的片面性，世界就不会是多面的。
    因此，理智应用了抽象私法中那些现存的范畴（其格式见之于罗马法），取消了所有权的这种两重性和不固定形态。由于立法者的理智把自己的国家特权取消了，他也就认为更有理由把这个不固定的所有权对贫民阶级的责任也加以取消。然而它忘记了，即使单纯从私法角度讲，这里也有两种私权（法），占有者的私权（法）和非占有者的私权（法），更何况任何立法都没有取消过所有权的国家特权，去掉的只是这些特权的胡作非为的性质，而赋以它们以民事的性质。中世纪的一切权利形态，其中也包括所有权，在各方面都是二重的、二元的、分裂的，而理智也就理直气壮地用自己的统一原则对抗这种矛盾的规定，但理智仍然忽略了一种情况，即有些所有权对象按其本质来说永远也不能具有那种早被确认的私有财产的性质，而由于前者的原始性质和它的偶然存在只是属于先占权的范围，也就是属于这样一种阶级的先占权的范围，这个阶级正是由于这种先占权而被排除于任何其他所有权之外，它在市民社会中的地位同那些所有权对象在自然界中的地位是一样的。……
    由此可见，在贫民阶级的习惯中存在着本能的权利感，这些习惯权利的根源是肯定的、合法的，而习惯法（权利）在这里更是十分自然的，因为贫民阶级的存在本身至今仍然不过只是市民社会的一种习惯，而这种习惯在国家的有意识的划分中还没有找到它的应有的地位。”
    从马克思上述这一长段话里，我认为有四点情况应该指出：
   （一）马克思在这里所要揭露的，主要是从德国封建社会中脱胎而形成的资产阶级法的那种掩盖特权阶级兽性的普遍形式的假相。这正是当时《莱茵报》展开关于林木盗窃法辩论时德国一般法所表现的情况。这里，马克思并没有要着重揭示欧洲中世纪劳动人民在专断蛮横凶暴残酷的封建法制下所遭受的悲惨命运。
      （二）在揭露林木盗窃法的实质的辩论中，马克思无疑是在为贫民阶级伸张权利（贫民的习惯权利）。不过，在马克思的早期著作中，确也存在着一些自然法和自然权利的残余观念。而且，当时马克思是在德国容克大地主资产阶级的统治下进行辩论，在辩论中他不得不就普鲁士现行地方法的情况出发进行揭露与批判，这也是可以理解的。
      （三）马克思在上述这段文字中一再指出，特权阶级的习惯权利不是什么别的东西，它只可能是自有阶级社会以来剥削者血腥镇压与残酷压榨劳动人民血汗的兽性权利的表现。它是“违法的”，不合理的；这里所谓违法，马克思指的是违反法的人性理念。
    但是马克思十分明确地指出，这些特权阶级的所谓习惯权利的整个内容，不论是合理的或不合理的，包括它们一切可能的效果，都已全部预计于特权阶级法律之内了。他说：“他们没有权利在法律之外还要求什么。”他指出，这里“根本谈不到什么特权阶级的习惯权利”；如果还有什么的话，也只能是特权阶级的一些额外享受。
      （四）但是我认为马克思这一长段话中最重要的一点意思是：如果要谈剥削阶级法所反映的矛盾，指出其表现的二重性，要加以一分为二的话，那只能是“占有者的私权（法）和非占有者的私权（法）”之间的矛盾；这个矛盾，正象马克思所说，已由特权阶级立法者的“理智”加以统一，即统一于肯定剥削制度与维护特权阶级利益的一面了。贫民阶级的习惯权利在剥削阶级的统治下不可能得到任何法律形式的承认与肯定。
    根据上述意见，我认为从马克思《关于林木盗窃法的辩论》中所说的话里是得不出说明中国封建社会“清官”和“贪官”或豪强恶霸在观念上的区别的任何理论根据的。
