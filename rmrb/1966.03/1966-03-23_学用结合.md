    Learning and Application Combined
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a living example of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the past, I did theoretical work, and although I read many of Chairman Mao's books, my study was mostly dogmatic, and I didn't sufficiently integrate theory with practice to transform my subjective world. After coming to Wuzhai County in 1964, I buried myself in routine work and studied very little, going to another extreme. Because I couldn't creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, my investigation and research couldn't be thorough, my work on production was always just patching things up, I lacked the ambition to transform the world, and I didn't clearly raise the banner of relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Furthermore, I didn't set an example by taking the lead in practice, so my work was in a passive state for a long time, becoming like an old monk's hat—mediocre.

    学用结合
    焦裕禄同志是一个活学活用毛主席著作的活样板。我过去是做理论工作的，虽然也看了不少毛主席的书，但多是教条式的学习，联系实际，改造自己的主观世界很不够。一九六四年来五寨工作后，又埋在事务圈子里，学习很少了，走到另一个极端。由于不能活学活用毛主席著作，调查研究不能深入，搞生产老是修修补补，缺乏改天换地的雄心壮志，依靠贫下中农的旗帜也举的不鲜明，更没有以身作则带头实践，所以工作上长期处于被动局面，成了老和尚的帽子——平不塔。
