    Zimbabwean People Determined to Take Up Arms to Overthrow Colonial Rule
    Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization and Others Reaffirm Support for Zimbabwean People's Struggle on "Zimbabwe Day"
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 16) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently wrote to the Zimbabwe African Trade Union Congress on the occasion of "Zimbabwe Day" on March 17. The letter stated that Chinese workers deeply admire the struggle of Zimbabwean workers and people against the heinous conspiracies of imperialists and colonialists and pledge to be a staunch backing for the Zimbabwean people.
    The All-China Youth Federation also wrote to the Zimbabwe African National Union, expressing firm support for the just struggle of the Zimbabwean people and youth against imperialism and for genuine national independence.
    The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement today on "Zimbabwe Day," extending fraternal greetings to the fighting Zimbabwean people. The statement said that the Chinese people have consistently and resolutely supported the struggle of the Zimbabwean people and all African people against imperialism and for national independence and defense. The statement expressed deep conviction that no matter how vicious and malicious imperialism headed by the United States and new and old colonialism are, and no matter what conspiracies they employ, and no matter how tortuous and arduous the road of struggle is, the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of African countries can never be extinguished and will surely achieve final victory. The heroic Zimbabwean people will certainly achieve genuine independence and freedom.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, March 16) Our correspondent reports: On the eve of "Zimbabwe Day" (March 17), news coming here from Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia) indicates that the Zimbabwean people are determined to strengthen their struggle, overthrow the colonial rule of the Smith regime, which is supported by British and American imperialism, and strive for genuine independence.
    News reports that recently, guerrilla activities by African freedom fighters against the Smith colonial regime have emerged in some areas of Southern Rhodesia, causing great unease to the colonial authorities. In early March, in the town of Magwegwe near Bulawayo, the second largest city, Africans launched attacks on colonial officials in resistance to colonial rule. Local Africans continue to resist the bloody suppression by colonial troops. Other reports say that, under the resolute struggle of the Zimbabwean people, the Smith colonial authorities, who are panic-stricken, have not only extended the "state of emergency" implemented throughout the country and intensified violent suppression, but have also strengthened the security of Smith's official residence.
    For more than four months, the new crimes of the imperialists and colonialists in Southern Rhodesia have only provided new negative examples to the African people, enriching their experience in struggle and strengthening their fighting spirit and determination to win independence. Some Zimbabwean freedom fighters recently told Xinhua reporters here that before the illegal declaration of "independence," they believed that Zimbabwe could achieve independence through "constitutional negotiations" with the British government. But now they believe that there is only one way, that is, to take up arms and overthrow the colonial regime, which is armed to the teeth and supported by British and American imperialism. Some of them also pointed out that the United Nations is a tool of US and British imperialism. The resolutions passed by the United Nations are detrimental to the Zimbabwean people and beneficial to British imperialism, and no illusions should be held about the United Nations.
    The idea of armed struggle and self-reliance has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the African people. People firmly believe that although the road to victory is tortuous, as long as the Zimbabwean people strengthen national unity, persevere in long-term struggle, and with the support of the African people and the people of the world, they will surely be victorious.

    津巴布韦人民决心拿起武器推翻殖民统治
    我亚非团结会等就“津巴布韦日”重申支持津巴布韦人民斗争
    据新华社十六日讯　中华全国总工会最近就三月十七日“津巴布韦日”写信给津巴布韦非洲人工会大会。信中说，中国工人对津巴布韦工人和人民为反对帝国主义和殖民主义者这一罪恶阴谋而进行的斗争深表敬佩，并誓作津巴布韦人民的后盾。
    全国青联也写信给津巴布韦非洲民族联盟，对津巴布韦人民和青年反对帝国主义、争取真正民族独立的正义斗争表示坚决支持。
    中国亚非团结委员会今天在就“津巴布韦日”发表的声明中，向斗争中的津巴布韦人民致兄弟的敬意。声明说，中国人民一贯坚决支持津巴布韦人民和全体非洲人民的反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。声明中表示深信，不论以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义怎样穷凶极恶和施展什么阴谋诡计，也不管斗争的道路是怎样曲折艰巨，非洲各国人民的反帝革命斗争是永远扑灭不了的，是一定要取得最后胜利的；英勇的津巴布韦人民，是一定能够取得真正的独立和自由的。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十六日电　本社记者报道：在“津巴布韦日”（三月十七日）前夕，从津巴布韦（南罗得西亚）传到这里的消息表明，津巴布韦人民决心加强斗争，推翻英美帝国主义支持下的史密斯集团的殖民统治，争取真正的独立。
    消息说，最近，在南罗得西亚的一些地区出现了非洲自由战士反对史密斯殖民政权的游击战活动，使殖民当局感到十分不安。三月初，在第二大城布拉瓦约附近的马格韦格韦市镇，爆发了非洲人反抗殖民统治的袭击殖民官员事件。当地的非洲人还在继续抵抗殖民军队的血腥镇压。另有消息说，在津巴布韦人民的坚决斗争下，惶惶不安的史密斯殖民当局除了延长在全国实行的“紧急状态”、加紧暴力镇压外，已对史密斯的官邸加强了警卫。
    四个多月来，帝国主义者和殖民主义者在南罗得西亚的新罪行，只是向非洲人民提供了新的反面教材，使他们的斗争经验更加丰富，加强了他们的斗志和争取独立的决心。津巴布韦的一些自由战士最近在这里对新华社记者说，在非法宣布“独立”以前，他们认为，津巴布韦可以通过同英国政府举行“制宪谈判”来取得独立。但是现在认为，只有一条路，即拿起武器，推翻在英美帝国主义支持下武装到牙齿的殖民政权。他们中间有些人还指出，联合国是美英帝国主义的工具。联合国通过的决议对津巴布韦人民不利，而对英帝国主义有利，不能对联合国存幻想。
    武装斗争和自力更生的思想在非洲人民中间已经更加深入人心。人们深信，虽然走向胜利的道路是曲折的，但是只要津巴布韦人民加强民族团结，坚持长期斗争，在非洲人民和世界人民的支持下，他们一定会胜利。
