    The venue of the memorial service was adorned with wreaths sent by Party and state leaders such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and others. Wreaths were also sent by various central government organs, people's organizations, and well-known figures from educational and academic circles.
    Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of the Secretariat, attended the memorial service and presented a wreath to the portrait of Comrade Ai Siqi.
    Also attending the memorial service were Comrades Kang Sheng, Guo Moruo, Wu Yuzhang, Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, Zhang Jichun, Xiao Hua, An Ziwen, Fan Wenlan, Xu Bing, Jiang Nanxiang, Kong Yuan, Zhang Jingfu, and others.

    Lin Feng, Principal of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered a memorial speech. He said, "Today, with heavy hearts, we mourn Comrade Ai Siqi, a loyal fighter on the Party's theoretical front." He said, "From his youth until his last breath, Comrade Ai Siqi actively participated in the propaganda and education work of Marxist-Leninist philosophy under the leadership of the Party. He tirelessly studied and researched Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously criticized bourgeois academic thought and modern revisionist trends. On the theoretical propaganda and education front, he devoted his life to doing much beneficial work for the Party.
    "Comrade Ai Siqi was utterly devoted to the Party, listened to the Party, and was a docile tool of the Party. He was modest and prudent, and had an open mind. Standing on the Party's position, he unyieldingly persisted in the struggle against opportunism. The excellent qualities possessed by Comrade Ai Siqi are worthy of our emulation."
    Comrade Lin Feng concluded, "Comrade Ai Siqi has bid farewell to us forever, but the spirit with which he worked diligently and wholeheartedly for the Party throughout his life will remain alive in our hearts." After the memorial service, Comrade Ai Siqi's ashes were moved to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in the western suburbs of Beijing for burial. (Picture attached)
