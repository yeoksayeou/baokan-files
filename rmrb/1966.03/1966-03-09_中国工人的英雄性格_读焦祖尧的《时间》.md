    The Heroic Character of Chinese Workers
    ——Reading Jiao Zuyao's "Time"
    Taiyuan Liang Gengshou
    Jiao Zuyao's short story "Time" (published in the January 1965 issue of "Harvest" magazine) is a relatively good work. Through the conflict caused by the different understandings of time between Ji Aishui and his son, it expresses the Chinese working class's attitude of being masters of their own affairs, and expresses the older generation's earnest expectations and strict demands on the younger generation.

    Mastering time, who among comrades participating in revolutionary work doesn't understand this? But the things we think we understand best often prevent us from truly recognizing their significance. In "Time," the young miner Ji Yangchun believes that "time is calculated by clocks, twenty-four hours a day, eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, and one and a half hours to watch a movie..." But in his father Ji Aishui's eyes, time is not what the clock hands record, but the magnificent cause of the communist revolution! It is from this ideological height that the author grasps the theme of the work.

    Due to the different understandings of time, conflicts between father and son naturally arise. For the old miner Ji Aishui, who was deeply trampled upon and weathered many hardships in the old society, strong class love and hatred, and the working class's noble revolutionary sense of responsibility, gave him a clear understanding of the relationship between the past, present, and future. Therefore, the thought of fighting for the communist revolution for the rest of his life naturally became his flesh and blood, penetrating into his bones, and placed in his "heart." He likes to listen to the rumbling sound of machines operating, he likes to go to work a little earlier and leave work a little later, and this has become his "habit." Embodied in him is the Chinese working class's high sense of revolutionary responsibility and conscious labor enthusiasm. The young miner Ji Yangchun is different. In his view, time is calculated by clocks, and work is carried out according to clocks. Under the control of this thought, he lives mechanically and rigidly according to the clock, only seeing the movement of the clock hands and not seeing the progress of the torrent of life; only hearing the subtle sound of the clock ticking and not hearing the call of the battle life. How exactly should we treat life? Should we adopt an active and enterprising spirit, or hold a passive and indifferent attitude? Should we be the masters of time, or be dominated by time? Two different understandings unfold a conflict between Ji Aishui and Ji Yangchun. This is not a general father-son conflict, but a conflict between extreme enthusiasm and responsibility towards the revolutionary cause and passive and negative thinking. Through the conflict and its resolution between them, the work reveals a thought-provoking theme: that any work is revolution, and all is for realizing the great ideal of communism. Therefore, each of us must cherish time and consciously work diligently for the arrival of this day.

    "Time" has a theme that is rich in practical significance, and it raises a serious question about life: how to treat life. Therefore, the work can give you life enlightenment, room for thought, the power of impact, and encourage you to actively treat life and consciously be the master of life.

    This work also has some characteristics in artistic depiction.

    The development of the plot in "Time" can closely revolve around the contradiction and conflict of the characters' personalities. At the beginning of the novel, it forcefully renders the tense atmosphere formed by the father and son's different understandings of "time." Then, through the description of specific work scenes, the author initially tells the reader that their contradiction on the "time" issue is based on the difference in work attitudes. Why are work attitudes different? In the third part, the author skillfully uses Ji Aishui's painful memories to explain the root of the problem. Because the scene of recalling bitterness is timely and can still closely revolve around the main thread of the father and son's different views on "time," it is not far-fetched or stiff. Through the father's earnest teachings, Ji Yangchun is greatly moved, and there are also changes in his actions, and the contradiction seems to be resolved. However, the son's understanding of "time" has not grasped the essence, so the plot twists and turns, and the contradiction continues to develop in depth. Finally, through Ji Aishui's exemplary actions and teachings, he truly educates his son and resolves the contradiction. Throughout the article, personality conflict is the guiding principle, the understanding of "time" is the center, the watch is the clue, there is relaxation and tension, there are waves and ripples, compact and moving.

    This work also has some shortcomings. Going to work a little earlier and leaving work a little later is not the essential problem. The main problem is whether or not there is the thinking of being masters of one's own affairs and a conscious attitude towards labor.
  "Time" does not express this idea prominently and clearly enough, and it makes an excessive rendering of the time of going to and from work, which makes it seem a bit stiff.

    中国工人的英雄性格
    ——读焦祖尧的《时间》
    太原  梁庚寿
    焦祖尧的短篇小说《时间》（见一九六五年一月份《收获》杂志）是一篇较好的作品。它通过季艾水父子对于时间的不同的理解所造成的冲突，表现了中国工人阶级主人翁的劳动态度，表现了老一辈对年青一代殷切的期望和严格的要求。
    掌握时间，对于参加革命工作的同志们来说，谁还不懂得呢？但自以为最明白的事情，却往往不能真正认清它的意义。《时间》中的青年矿工季阳春，认为“时间用钟表来计算，一天二十四小时，上班时间是八小时，睡觉也要八小时，看一场电影的时间是一个半小时……。”而在他父亲季艾水的眼中，时间并不是钟表指针所记录下来的东西，而是壮丽的共产主义革命事业！作者正是从这样一个思想高度来把握作品的主题的。
    由于对时间理解的不同，自然地造成父子间的矛盾和冲突。对于在旧社会深受践踏、饱经风霜的老矿工季艾水来说，强烈的阶级爱憎和工人阶级崇高的革革责任感，使他对过去、现在、未来三者的关系有着清楚的理解。所以为共产主义革命事业奋斗终生的思想，便自然地变成了他的血肉，深入到他的骨髓，放在他的“心坎”上。他喜欢听机器运转时隆隆的声音，他喜欢提早一点上班和推迟一些下班，这也成了他的“习惯”。在他身上，体现着中国工人阶级高度的革命责任感，自觉的劳动热忱。青年矿工季阳春则不同。在他看来，时间是按钟表计算的，工作是按钟表进行的。在这种思想支配下，他机械刻板地根据钟表来生活，只看到钟表指针的移动，看不到生活急流的前进；只听到钟表走动的细微的声音，听不见战斗生活的召唤。究竟怎样对待生活？是采取积极进取的精神，还是抱着消极冷漠的态度？是做时间的主人，还是受时间的支配？两种不同的认识，在季艾水与季阳春之间展开了一场冲突。这不是一般的父子冲突，而是对革命事业极端热忱负责与被动消极的两种思想的冲突。作品通过他们之间的矛盾冲突及其解决，揭示了一个引人深思的主题：即任何工作都是革命，都是为了实现共产主义的伟大理想。因此，我们每个人必须珍惜时间，为这一天的到来而自觉勤奋地工作。
    《时间》的主题是富有现实意义的，它提出了一个严肃的生活问题：怎样对待生活的问题。因此作品能给你生活的启示，思索的余地，冲击的力量，鼓舞你积极地去对待生活，自觉地做生活的主人。
    这篇作品在艺术描写上也有一些特色。
  《时间》的情节发展，能紧紧地环绕着人物的性格的矛盾冲突而展开。小说一开头就较有力地渲染出了父子俩由于对“时间”的不同认识所形成的紧张气势，接着作者通过对具体工作场面的描写，初步地告诉读者，他们在“时间”问题上的矛盾，是基于工作态度的不同。工作态度的不同又是因为什么呢？第三部分作者巧妙地利用季艾水的痛苦回忆说明了问题的根源。由于忆苦的场面适逢其时，并仍能紧紧围绕父子对“时间”不同看法这一主脉，所以毫不牵强附会和生硬。通过父亲语重心长的教导，季阳春大受感动，行动上也有了转变，矛盾似乎解决了。但儿子对“时间”的理解并未抓住本质，因而峰回路转，矛盾继续向深处发展。最后通过季艾水的身教言教，才真正地教育了儿子，解决了矛盾。通篇以性格冲突为纲，以对“时间”的理解为中心，以手表为线索，有弛有张，有波有澜，紧凑动人。
    这篇作品还有一些缺陷，提早一些上班与推迟一点下班，这不是本质问题。主要问题是有没有主人翁的思想，自觉的劳动态度。
  《时间》表现这个思想还不够突出鲜明，而在上班下班的时间上作了过分的渲染，因而显得有点生硬。
