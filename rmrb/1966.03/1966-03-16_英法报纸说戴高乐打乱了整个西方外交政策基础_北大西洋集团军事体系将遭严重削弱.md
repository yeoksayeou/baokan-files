    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, French and British newspapers point out that French President De Gaulle's formal proposal to withdraw from the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" institutions has plunged the North Atlantic Group into an unprecedented and serious crisis.
    The French ruling party, Union for the New Republic's newspaper *La Nation*, published an article by Rodier on the 9th, asking: "Should France, as a sovereign nation, be asked to abandon its control over its own destiny in the event of a conflict involving it? When everyone knows that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in its current form, can no longer provide France's security with indispensable guarantees, should France remain silent?"
    *Combat*’s editorial on the same day pointed out that De Gaulle’s decision "will obviously disrupt not only the Atlantic defense system, but also the fundamental reliance upon which Western diplomacy is based." The editorial said, "Undoubtedly, the international aspect of this event is more alarming. Washington reacted quickly."
    The editorial pointed out that the United States will launch diplomatic activities in the coming months to restrain France’s demands, "but this kind of diplomatic activity can only be a case of getting half the result with twice the effort, and President Johnson knows this."
    The British newspaper *The Times*’s editorial on the 9th said that France's decision makes "the question of the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization even more serious than in the past." The editorial said, "Removing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters from France will cause inconvenience. Making some alternative supply arrangements will cause disconnections. Not having France as the rear of the Western troops stationed in Europe is a loss... and the psychological blow of France leaving the alliance institutions is even greater."
    *The Financial Times*’s editorial on the 10th said that De Gaulle "is taking actions that go even further and faster than his critics had ever worried about," "If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to continue to exist, then this organization will be severely weakened by the withdrawal of its largest and most centrally located member from the military system that was built up with great effort."

    英法报纸说戴高乐打乱了整个西方外交政策基础
    北大西洋集团军事体系将遭严重削弱
    据新华社十四日讯　法国和英国的报纸指出，法国总统戴高乐正式提出要退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构使北大西洋集团陷入空前严重的危机。
    法国执政党保卫新共和联盟机关报《民族报》九日发表罗迪埃写的一篇文章质问道：“难道人们应该要求作为一个主权国家的法国在发生同它有关的冲突情况下放弃主宰自己的命运？当每个人都知道北大西洋公约组织在它目前的形式下不再能给法国的安全以不可缺少的保证时，难道法国应该保持沉默？”
    《战斗报》同一天的社论指出，戴高乐的决定“显然不仅将会打乱大西洋防务体系，而且还会打乱西方外交赖于作为基础的基本依靠”。社论说，“无疑，这个事件的国际方面是比较惊人的。华盛顿反应迅速”。
    社论指出，美国在今后几个月内将展开外交活动，抑制法国的要求，“但是，这种外交活动只能是事倍功半，约翰逊总统是知道这一点的”。
    英国《泰晤士报》九日的社论说，法国的决定使“北大西洋公约组织的前途问题比过去更加严重了”。社论说，“把北大西洋公约组织总部从法国撤出，会造成不方便。另作一些供应安排，则会造成脱节。没有法国作西方驻欧洲部队的后方，是一个损失……而法国离开联盟机构的打击在心理上更要大得多。”
    《金融时报》十日的社论说，戴高乐“正在采取的行动，甚至比抨击他的人所曾耽心的更进一步，步伐更加迅速”，“如果北大西洋公约组织要继续存在下去的话，那么这个组织将由于它的最大的和占最中心地位的成员退出那个费了极大力气建立起来的军事体系而遭到严重削弱。”
