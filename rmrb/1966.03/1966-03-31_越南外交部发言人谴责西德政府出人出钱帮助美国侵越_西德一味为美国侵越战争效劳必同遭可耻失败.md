    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 29th – The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 29th, strongly condemning the West German government's collusion with the United States and its service to the US war of aggression against South Vietnam.
    The statement pointed out that a West German government delegation, led by Special Ambassador and former Hitler SS officer Schmidt-Horix, is currently active in Saigon to discuss concrete measures with the United States and the Saigon puppet regime to strengthen West Germany's service to the US war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The statement pointed out that previously, the West German government had already provided hundreds of millions of marks to equip the Saigon puppet army and help it build logistical bases. The West German government also produces bombs for the United States and provides technicians, materials, and experience in the manufacture of poison gas and chemical poisons. West German newspapers have repeatedly revealed that the West German government has sent many cadres and military personnel to South Vietnam and is planning to form a foreign legion to send to South Vietnam.
    The statement said that these criminal actions of the West German government are part of the US plan to instigate more vassal states to participate in the war of aggression against South Vietnam.
    The West German militarist revanchist clique betrays the true interests of the West German people and attempts to gain US assistance in obtaining nuclear weapons by sending mercenaries to South Vietnam.
    The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the above-mentioned conspiracies and actions of the West German government and firmly demands that the West German government immediately cease its collusion with the United States in the war of aggression in South Vietnam.
    The statement called on the West German people to take more resolute action to stop the criminal claws of the West German authorities in time.
    The statement said that the US aggressors are suffering disastrous defeats in Vietnam and will surely suffer complete defeat.
    If the West German government stubbornly continues to provide personnel and money to help the United States invade South Vietnam, then it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused thereby, and it will suffer the same disgraceful end as the US aggressors.

    越南外交部发言人谴责西德政府出人出钱帮助美国侵越
    西德一味为美国侵越战争效劳必同遭可耻失败
    新华社河内二十九日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十九日发表声明，强烈谴责西德政府同美国勾结，为美国侵略越南南方战争效劳。
    声明指出，由特派大使、原希特勒党卫军军官施密特·霍里克斯率领的西德的一个政府代表团目前正在西贡活动，以便同美国和西贡伪政权讨论加强西德为美国侵越战争效劳的具体措施。
    声明指出，在此以前，西德政府已经提供成亿的马克，以装备西贡傀儡军队和帮助它建设后勤基地。西德政府还为美国生产炸弹，提供制造毒气和化学毒药的技术人员、资料和经验。西德报刊曾经多次透露，西德政府派遣了许多干部和军事人员到越南南方，并且正在策划成立外籍兵团派往越南南方。
    声明说，西德政府的这些罪恶行动，是美国嗾使更多的仆从国参加侵略越南南方战争的计划的一部分。
    西德军国主义复仇主义集团背叛西德人民的真正利益，企图以派遣雇佣军到越南南方来换取美国帮助它们染指核武器。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府强烈谴责西德政府的上述阴谋和行动，坚决要求西德政府立即停止它在越南南方的侵略战争中同美国的勾结。
    声明呼吁西德人民采取更加坚决的行动，及时制止西德当局的罪恶魔爪。
    声明说，美国侵略者正在越南遭到惨败，并且必将遭到完全的失败。
    如果西德政府一味顽固地出人、出钱来帮助美国侵略越南南方，那么它必须对由此而造成的一切后果承担全部责任，而且它必将遭到同美国侵略者一样的可耻下场。
