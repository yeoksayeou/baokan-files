    The U.S. 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), touted by the United States as an "ace army" with "high mobility," has not only failed to reverse the losing situation of the U.S. military in its invasion of South Vietnam since its entry in September of last year, but has also been badly battered itself, losing more than one-third of its troops. The following are the defeats of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the South Vietnamese battlefield over the past five months:
    From September 18 to 19, 1965, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, annihilated more than 200 American invading soldiers and shot down or damaged 60 helicopters in Thuan Ninh, about 30 kilometers northeast of An Khe, the base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division.
    From October 10 to 14, 1965, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, annihilated 363 American invading soldiers, shot down 17 helicopters, damaged 7, and captured a large number of weapons in Phu Cat County.
    From October 19 to November 19, 1965, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army annihilated a total of 2,500 enemy soldiers in the battle of encircling and ambushing reinforcements in the Plei Me area of Gia Lai Province, including the complete annihilation of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and four other companies, totaling more than 1,700 people, shot down or damaged 31 helicopters, and captured a large number of weapons and military supplies.
    From December 18 to 20, 1965, the liberation armed forces in Binh Khe County, Binh Dinh Province, annihilated a total of 484 enemy soldiers, including 376 from the 1st Cavalry Division, shot down 14 helicopters, and damaged many others.
    From January 27 to February 21 of this year, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, crushed the so-called "Operation Masher" (later renamed "Operation White Wing") launched by more than 20,000 American invading soldiers and South Korean mercenary troops in the Bong Son area. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 4,500 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 2,741 from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, and more than 200 aircraft were shot down, damaged, and destroyed.
    From the night of February 19 to the early morning of February 20 this year, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army suddenly attacked the division's base in An Khe, annihilating a total of 497 American invading soldiers, destroying 97 aircraft of various types, leveling the division's general radio transmitting station, and burning down many warehouses and barracks.

    美国第一骑兵师挨打记
    被美国吹嘘为“王牌军”和有“高度机动性”的美国第一骑兵师（空中机动师），自去年九月侵入越南南方以后，不仅没有能挽救侵越美军的败局，而且自己也被打得落花流水，损失兵力三分之一以上。以下就是美国第一骑兵师在南越战场上五个多月来的败绩：
    一九六五年九月十八日到十九日，南越平定省解放武装力量在距离美国第一骑兵师的基地——安溪东北面约三十公里的顺宁，歼灭美国侵略军两百多名，击落、击伤直升飞机六十架。
    一九六五年十月十日到十四日，南越平定省解放武装力量，在符吉县，歼灭美国侵略军三百六十三名，打落直升飞机十七架，打伤七架，缴获大批武器。
    一九六五年十月十九日到十一月十九日，南越解放军在嘉莱省波来梅地区的围点打援战斗中，共歼敌两千五百名，其中全歼美国第一骑兵师第三旅第一营和其他四个连，共一千七百多人，击落击伤直升飞机三十一架，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    一九六五年十二月十八日到二十日，解放武装力量在平定省平溪县共歼敌军四百八十四名，其中歼灭第一骑兵师三百七十六名，击落直升飞机十四架，击伤多架。
    今年一月二十七日到二月二十一日，南越平定省解放武装力量在蓬山地区，粉碎两万多名美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军发动的所谓“捣碎机攻势”（后来改名为“白翼攻势”）。据不完全统计，共歼敌四千五百多名，其中有美国第一骑兵师的部队二千七百四十一名，击落、击伤和炸毁飞机二百多架。
    今年二月十九日夜到二十日凌晨，南越解放军突然袭击这个师在安溪的基地，共歼灭美国侵略军四百九十七名，摧毁各种类型飞机九十七架，夷平了这个师的无线电总发报站，烧毁许多仓库和兵营。
