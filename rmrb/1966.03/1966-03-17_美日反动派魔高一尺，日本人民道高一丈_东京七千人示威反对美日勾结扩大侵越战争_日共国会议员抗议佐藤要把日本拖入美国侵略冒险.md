    The U.S.-Japanese Reactionaries Are One Foot Higher, the Japanese People Are Ten Feet Higher
    Tokyo Seven Thousand People Demonstrate in Tokyo Against U.S.-Japanese Collusion to Expand the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Protest Sato's Attempt to Drag Japan into America's Aggressive Adventures
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 15th: Workers, students, and citizens in Tokyo, Japan, have been holding continuous gatherings, expressing their intention to use practical struggle to successfully hold the "National Unified Action to Realize Various Demands" on March 20th. Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, delivered a speech to more than 7,000 young workers and students in Tokyo on the evening of the 14th, severely condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and exposing the Sato government's attempt to send troops abroad to act as accomplices of the U.S. aggressors.
    On the evening of the 14th, approximately seven thousand young workers and students braved the cold wind to hold a gathering in Hibiya Park, Tokyo.
    Yoshitaro Hirano emphasized that the Vietnam issue today must be observed from a class viewpoint. The Vietnam War is by no means a simple international dispute, as some people say, but a war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism against Vietnam. Therefore, only the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops is the correct way to solve the Vietnam issue.
    Hirano said that Vietnam is currently the focus of various contradictions in the world. The Vietnamese people are fighting for national liberation, standing on the forefront of the world's people's anti-American struggle, and fighting for the progress of mankind and world peace. Hirano said that the Vietnam issue once again shows that there can be absolutely no "peaceful coexistence" between the oppressor and the oppressed, the aggressor and the aggressed. The people's war waged by the Vietnamese people will defeat all aggressors and is bound to achieve final victory.
    Hirano also condemned the Japanese Sato government for providing bases and military supplies to U.S. imperialism for its aggression against Vietnam. He said that the Sato government has become an accomplice to the U.S. imperialist aggressor-in-chief. Hirano expressed that the Japanese people firmly oppose the Sato government's attempt to invite Nguyen Cao Ky, the puppet of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam, to visit Japan.
    Hirano pointed out that the Sato Cabinet is plotting to formulate a "Law on Cooperation with the United Nations," attempting to send troops abroad, and is also plotting to establish a single-seat constituency system, amend the Constitution, and implement conscription. He said that Japanese youth and students should, like the Vietnamese patriotic youth Nguyen Van Troi, fight for the complete independence of the motherland and for smashing the enemy's war plot.
    The conference passed a declaration of struggle, calling on Japanese youth and students to unite, protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and prevent Nguyen Cao Ky, the South Vietnamese puppet whose hands are stained with the blood of the South Vietnamese people, from visiting Japan. After the meeting, the attendees sang revolutionary songs and went to the Diet to petition. They also shouted slogans such as: "Oppose the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky coming to Japan!" "Oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam!" "Down with the Sato Cabinet! Dissolve the Diet!" and held demonstrations in the downtown area of ​​Tokyo.
    In the Oji district of Tokyo's Kita ward, about a thousand residents held a rally and demonstration that evening to oppose the United States establishing a field hospital in the area to accommodate wounded and sick U.S. troops invading Vietnam.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 15th: The Japanese Communist Party Diet Members' Group submitted a letter of protest to Prime Minister Sato on the 14th, strongly condemning the Japanese government for assisting U.S. imperialism in its attempt to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Asia.
    Masao Iwama, Deputy Head of the Japanese Communist Party Diet Members' Group, and Goro Sudo, a Japanese Communist Party Diet member, submitted a letter of protest to Prime Minister Eisaku Sato on the evening of the 14th. The letter of protest stated: "Prime Minister Sato's refusal to withdraw his remarks about dispatching troops to 'defend Okinawa' together with the United States shows that the Sato government is pursuing a policy of vigorously cooperating with U.S. imperialism to expand the flames of the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Asia."
    The letter of protest emphasized: "The policy implemented by the Sato Cabinet is a policy to help U.S. imperialism expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Asia, and to drag the entire Japan, including Okinawa, into the war."

    美日反动派魔高一尺，日本人民道高一丈
    东京七千人示威反对美日勾结扩大侵越战争
    日共国会议员抗议佐藤要把日本拖入美国侵略冒险
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本东京的工人、学生和市民连续举行集会表示要用实际斗争，成功地举行三月二十日的“实现各项要求全国统一行动”。日本和平委员会会长平野义太郎十四日晚上对东京七千多青年工人和学生发表讲话，严厉谴责美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的罪行，并且揭露佐藤政府企图派兵出国，充当美国侵略者的帮凶。
    十四日晚上，大约七千名青年工人和学生，冒着寒风在东京日比谷公园举行集会。
    平野义太郎强调指出，必须用阶级观点来观察今天的越南问题。越南战争决不象有些人所说的那样，是什么单纯的国际纠纷，而是美帝国主义向越南发动的侵略战争。因此，只有美国全部撤出它的军队，才是解决越南问题的正确途径。
    平野说，越南是目前世界各种矛盾的焦点。越南人民正在为争取民族解放而斗争，他们站在世界人民反美斗争的最前线，为人类的进步事业与世界和平而战斗。平野说，越南问题再一次表明，压迫者与被压迫者之间，侵略者与被侵略者之间是绝对不能“和平共处”的。越南人民所进行的人民战争将击败一切侵略者，必定取得最后胜利。
    平野还谴责了日本佐藤政府向美帝国主义提供侵略越南的基地和军用物资。他说，佐藤政府已经成为美帝国主义侵略罪魁的帮凶。平野表示，日本人民坚决反对佐藤政府企图邀请美帝国主义的南越傀儡阮高其访问日本。
    平野指出，佐藤内阁正在阴谋制定“与联合国合作法案”，企图派兵出国，并且阴谋建立小选举区制、修改宪法和实行征兵制。他说，日本青年学生应当象越南爱国青年阮文追那样，为祖国的完全独立，为粉碎敌人的战争阴谋而奋斗。
    大会通过了斗争宣言，呼吁日本青年和学生团结起来，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，并且阻止双手沾满了南越人民鲜血的南越傀儡阮高其访问日本。大会结束后，到会者高唱革命歌曲，到国会去请愿。他们还高呼：“反对南越傀儡阮高其到日本来！”“反对美国侵略越南！”“打倒佐藤内阁！解散国会！”的口号，在东京的闹市区举行示威游行。
    在东京都北区的王子地方，这天晚上约一千名居民举行集会和示威游行，反对美国在这个地方建立野战医院，以收容侵越美军的伤病员。
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团十四日向首相佐藤递交抗议信，强烈谴责日本政府协助美帝国主义企图把侵越战争扩大到整个亚洲。
    日本共产党国会议员团副团长岩间正男和日共国会议员须藤五郎十四日晚上，向首相佐藤荣作递交了一封抗议信。抗议信指出：“佐藤首相拒绝撤销他关于派兵同美国一起‘防卫冲绳’的讲话，表明佐藤政府奉行大力配合美帝国主义把侵越战争的战火扩大到整个亚洲的政策。”
    抗议信强调说：“佐藤内阁执行的政策是为帮助美帝国主义把侵越战争扩大到整个亚洲，并且要把包括冲绳在内的整个日本拖入战争的政策。”
