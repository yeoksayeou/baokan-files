    The three articles published here explore the issue of reforming rules and regulations from the perspective of materialist dialectics. Since the national liberation, we have gradually reformed the old rules and regulations of enterprises and established new ones. Some of these new rules and regulations are still imperfect and need further reform.
    Rules and regulations serve production and the people's lives, and should reflect the objective laws of development. Practice has proven that rules and regulations that correctly reflect the objective laws of development promote the development of production and facilitate the people's lives. However, those rules and regulations that are divorced from reality, piecing together a bunch of dull and tasteless clauses, making it impossible for people to grasp the essentials, cannot serve production or the people's lives. Because these rules and regulations are formulated under the guidance of banal philosophical thought, they are metaphysical.
    We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the viewpoint of materialist dialectics to further reform unreasonable rules and regulations, and liberate ourselves from the shackles of banal philosophy. This is an important part of the revolutionization of enterprises.
    Socialist enterprises are the people's enterprises. Only when the rules and regulations of socialist enterprises are liberated from banal philosophy can the people's enterprises truly serve the people, and the people's enterprises rely on the people.

    从烦琐哲学中解放出来
    这里发表的三篇文章，运用唯物辩证法的观点，探讨了改革规章制度的问题。全国解放以来，我们逐步改革了企业的旧的规章制度，建立了新的规章制度。这些新的规章制度，有的还不完善，还需要进一步改革。
    规章制度是为生产、为人民生活服务的，它应当反映客观事物的发展规律。实践证明，凡是正确地反映了客观事物发展规律的规章制度，都促进了生产的发展，便利了人民的生活。而那些脱离实际，拼凑一大堆枯燥无味的条文，使人不得要领的规章制度，就不能为生产、为人民生活服务。因为这些规章制度是在烦琐哲学的思想指导下制定的，是形而上学的。
    我们必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，运用唯物辩证法的观点，进一步改革不合理的规章制度，从烦琐哲学的束缚中解放出来。这是企业革命化的一个重要内容。
    社会主义企业是人民的企业。社会主义企业的规章制度，只有从烦琐哲学中解放出来，才能做到人民的企业为人民，人民的企业靠人民。
