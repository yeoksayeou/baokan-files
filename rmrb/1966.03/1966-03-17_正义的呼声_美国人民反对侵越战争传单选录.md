    Voices of Justice
    Selected Leaflets of the American People Opposing the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    We hope you will oppose this war. We don't know what dangers we are running by giving you this leaflet, and you won't know what dangers you will run by opposing the war.
    More and more American soldiers have refused to go to Vietnam to fight and have been tried by military courts. They have shown great courage.
    You may have many other things to do. Because you are in the military, you understand better than civilians what ways can be taken to oppose it. But whatever you do, you must be careful. Draw your own conclusions from what you see, read, and hear. Don't be afraid to ask questions at informational meetings, and if you are not satisfied with the answers, keep asking. Take every opportunity to talk to your comrades about the war.

    As a soldier, you are trained to obey orders, but as a person, you must be responsible for your own actions. International law and American law both recognize that a soldier, even if acting under orders, must bear the ultimate legal and moral responsibility for their actions.
    This principle became part of the law after World War II. During World War II, the Allied powers met in London and decided that German war criminals must be punished, even if they committed war crimes under orders.
    This principle is the basis of the Nuremberg trials. We believe that the entire war in Vietnam is criminal and immoral. We believe that the atrocities that must be committed to wage war against the Vietnamese people are unforgivable.

    McNamara says, "Americans should endure casualties." Brother! That means you. You won't see him eating in the jungle or going home in a coffin. There are no bombs buried in the Pentagon like there are in your barracks, your base, and the local bars.

    正义的呼声
    美国人民反对侵越战争传单选录
    我们希望你将反对这种战争。我们不知道我们在给你这份传单时冒什么样的危险，你也不会知道你在反对战争时会冒什么危险。
    越来越多的美国兵已经拒绝到越南去作战，而且已经受到军事法庭的审判。他们表现得非常勇敢。
    你可能有另外许多事可以做。由于你是军人，你比老百姓更清楚地了解可以采取什么方式来反对。但是不管做什么事情，你必须小心。从你所看到的、读到的和听到的事情中得出自己的结论。在了解情况的会议上，不要怕提问题，如果你对回答不满意，继续提问题。利用一切机会向你的伙伴谈谈有关这次战争的情况。

    作为一名士兵，你受了服从命令的训练，但是作为一个人，你必须对你自己的行动负责。国际法和美国法律都承认，一名士兵即使是奉命采取行动，也必须对他的所作所为负最后的法律上的和道义上的责任。
    这一原则在第二次世界大战后已经成了法律的一部分。第二次世界大战时，盟国在伦敦开会决定必须对德国战犯进行惩罚，即使他们是根据命令而犯了战争罪行的。
    这个原则是纽伦堡审讯的基础。我们认为，越南的整个战争是犯罪的，是不道德的。我们认为，为了对越南人民进行战争而必须采取的暴行是不可饶恕的。

    麦克纳马拉说，“美国人应该忍受伤亡”。兄弟！这指的就是你。你不会看到他在丛林中吃饭，或装在棺材中回家。在五角大楼，也没有象你的营房，你的基地和当地酒巴一样，埋有炸弹。

    正文：转载美国《国民前卫》报一篇由美国青年彼得·莱梅·克拉克写的文章。作者在文章中叙述了他自己怎样在被征以后到征兵站散发反对侵越战争传单，征集反对侵越战争签名，拒绝在忠诚宣誓书上签名，从而避免被征兵的故事。
