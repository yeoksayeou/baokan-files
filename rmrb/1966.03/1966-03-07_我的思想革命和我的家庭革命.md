    Editor's Note: This article tells the story of a worker's family member who, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and through participation in collective production, gradually transformed her thinking and became an advanced element. The material is very vivid and colloquial; we suggest everyone read it.

    Two years ago, Comrade Tian Aizhen was a worker's family member with not-so-advanced thinking. When she first joined collective production, she shirked the heavy work and chose the easy, and was very unsettled. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works and undergoing a relatively long period of labor training, her class consciousness gradually increased, and she made rapid progress. She not only progressed herself but also helped her husband progress, and helped other comrades progress. At the recent Northwest Regional Industrial and Transportation Conference, Comrade Tian Aizhen was recognized as a red banner on the Northwest industrial and transportation front.

    Some workers' family members with backward thinking often have some negative influence on the workers' thinking in their daily family life. One important reason is that they are separated from collective production for a long time and confined to the small circle of the family. The experience of the revolutionary transformation of the families of Daqing workers, and Tian Aizhen's self-transformation experience, both tell us that to carry out ideological transformation of workers' family members, we must organize workers' family members to participate in collective production. Organizing workers' family members to participate in collective production can not only promote the revolutionary transformation of workers' family members but also have a positive effect on the revolutionary transformation of the workers' ranks.

    Industrial and mining enterprises in various places should, according to specific circumstances, organize workers' family members to participate in productive labor within their capabilities, each doing their best and getting what they deserve, to add new strength to socialist revolution and socialist construction.
      I am a family member of an employee of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, and the mother of two children. In March 1964, many workers' family members in our area participated in collective productive labor. I thought to myself: What's the point of staying at home every day when I'm so young? So I also signed up to join the Cleaning Team Three of the Karamay Service Company as a cleaning worker.

    From Being Unsettled at Work to Being Content at Work

    At first, I thought there was nothing to cleaning work, just sweeping up the garbage, loading it onto the cart, and pulling it to the Gobi Desert. Seeing other people pulling small carts so easily, it looked like riding in a sedan chair. However, when I actually started doing it, it wasn't as simple as I had thought.

    On the first day, pulling the small cart to the garbage dump to load garbage, there were all kinds of smells inside. When the dust was stirred up, I was almost unable to breathe. After the cart was loaded, it took a lot of effort to pull it. It didn't listen to me at all on the road. Other comrades pulled a full cart and ran effortlessly, but I couldn't. I couldn't pull it up on the uphill road, and I didn't dare go down on the downhill road. At this time, I realized that this job wasn't easy.

    I gritted my teeth and worked for three days, and I was so tired that my back ached, my legs hurt, and I couldn't lift my arms. At this time, I didn't want to do it anymore. But I was afraid of losing face if I quit. When I signed up, I said I wasn't afraid of getting dirty or tired. How could I be embarrassed to back down now? I carried this ideological burden and pulled the small cart for more than a month.

    One day, I heard that the team decided to use small carts to concentrate the garbage in one place, and then use tipper trucks to transport it out. I was extremely happy. I thought: Loading trucks would be easier and cleaner than pulling small carts. A few days later, when the team decided to draw some people to load trucks, I was the first to sign up.

    After going to the truck-loading team and loading trucks for a day, I realized that I hadn't found the "trick" and hadn't taken advantage of it. Loading trucks was dirtier and more tiring than pulling small carts. At this time, I was extremely angry and complained that I shouldn't have gone to the truck-loading team. But it was too late to regret it now, so I had to bite the bullet and do it.

    After that, I had no confidence in this job at all. I went to work every day in a huff, and when I got off work, I threw tantrums at my mother. My mother saw through my thoughts. She said: "You're tired from work, sit down and rest! The first three steps are difficult in any job, you'll get used to it."

    No matter what my mother said, I was still sluggish at work every day. If there was no ash, I would load the truck; if there was ash, I wouldn't load it, and I would stand aside and watch. I didn't accept other people's opinions, and even felt dissatisfied with others. I didn't listen to the team leader's education either. The team leader had no choice but to report the situation to the team headquarters.

    The captain came to me and said: "Little Tian, your team has a lot of opinions about you, do you know?"

    I said: "I don't know."

    The captain said: "If you don't do your job well in the future, you'll be transferred to another team."

    When I heard this, I was extremely happy: Any team is better than this team, and the work is cleaner than this team's work. After that, I deliberately didn't do my job well, wanting to make the comrades, the team leader, and the captain all very angry. If they got angry enough, they would transfer me out.

    After a few days, I didn't hear any news about being transferred out. I couldn't wait any longer, and went to the captain and said: "Captain, give me a job transfer, I really can't do this job."

    The captain said angrily: "You have to do it whether you can do it or not."

    I turned around and left after hearing this. I thought, what's so great about being a captain, aren't you just a family member like me? I'll load a few times when I'm happy, and I'll stand aside and rest when I'm not happy. Let's see what you, the captain, can do to me? As long as I go to work every day, I still get paid, and you can't give me a penny less.

    At the beginning of 1965, when I was carrying the heaviest ideological burden, the leaders and comrades helped and educated me, and asked me to study the deeds of the Daqing family members participating in labor together. After studying, my mind was shaken: Aunt Xue is so old, she doesn't care about compensation when she works, am I, a young person, not as good as an old lady?

    At this time, the drilling site was carrying out a socialist education movement, and my mother also participated. One evening I asked her what kind of meeting she was attending, and she said it was a comparison between the old and new societies by recalling them. Then, my mother began to talk about the family situation before and after liberation.

    Before liberation, my family was very poor, often not knowing where the next meal would come from. Despite this, the landlords and bullies were constantly looking for trouble for us and bullying us. My father knew how to do bricklaying work, and sometimes he earned some money doing odd jobs, but they would find ways to extort it as soon as they saw it. Several times, they locked my father up, and my mother had to borrow money everywhere and sell everything in the house to redeem my father. In 1949, my hometown was liberated, and the bullies and landlords were overthrown, and we finally lived a good life. However, my father's health was too severely damaged in the old society, and he contracted tuberculosis. Although the government made great efforts to give him good medicine and injections, it still couldn't cure him.

    When my mother mentioned these things, it made me recall them too. I was only twelve or thirteen years old at the time. When my father was dying, he grabbed my red scarf and said: "Child, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought us light. I hope you don't forget your roots, study hard, and grow up to repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's kindness." Recalling these things, and thinking about the present, I felt very sad. I hadn't done anything for the people in the past seven or eight years. Now that I'm working, I'm afraid of getting dirty and tired, and I'm not doing my job well. I knew I was completely wrong.

    When I became ideologically conscious, I began to study Chairman Mao's works. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I thought to myself, Bethune was a foreigner who dedicated his life to the Chinese revolution; I am Chinese, so how do I treat my work? I felt that Chairman Mao's words: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, shirking the heavy work and choosing the easy, pushing the heavy burden onto others and choosing the light one for themselves" seemed to be addressed to me. After that, I was more content at work.

    Later, our team organized everyone to study the advanced deeds of Shi Chuanxiang, a latrine cleaner in Beijing. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi met with Shi Chuanxiang, he said: "You are a cleaning worker, a servant of the people, and I am a chairman, also a servant of the people." This teaching made me understand a fundamental principle, that is, in our society, all work is to serve the people. If you do it well, you are serving them well. Pulling garbage and cleaning latrines is doing revolution, is specifically serving the people. I realized from the bottom of my heart that there are only dirty thoughts, not dirty jobs.

    From then on, I resolved to always listen to Chairman Mao's words, keep the suffering of the class firmly in mind, earnestly study Shi Chuanxiang, maintain and carry forward the true qualities of the working people, do whatever the Party tells me to do, and resolutely be a good cleaning worker.

    From Progressing Myself to Helping Others Progress

    Being content at work doesn't mean that I have no shortcomings.

    The first shortcoming is not accepting criticism. I can accept the team leader's opinions; I can't accept the comrades' opinions.

    Later, I thought to myself: Why can't I accept the comrades' opinions? Chairman Mao taught us: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing and pointing out our shortcomings. No matter who it is, anyone can point them out to us. As long as what you say is right, we will correct it." Comparing it with my own thoughts, I knew I was wrong again. At this time, I asked myself: You have read Chairman Mao's books, do you listen to Chairman Mao's teachings? Not accepting other people's criticism is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, it is wrong, and I must resolutely get rid of this bad habit. So, I took the initiative to make a self-criticism to all the comrades in the team.

    After overcoming this shortcoming, a concern arose in my mind. I felt that my body wasn't good, and I didn't have the strength to work as hard as others. Other people don't pant when they load a truck of garbage, but I gasp for breath after loading half a truck and have to stop and catch my breath before loading again. I thought to myself, everyone else is working non-stop, but I'm the only one stopping. Will others have opinions about me? What if they gossip about me? I want to do my job well, but what if I don't have that much strength? Thinking it over, I might as well do other work. But then I thought, is this in line with Chairman Mao's teachings? Linking it to Chairman Mao's teachings in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I knew my thinking was wrong again. People's strength is not the same, although my strength is small, but as long as I have the spirit of being utterly selfless, I can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people. Therefore, I resolved to throw this worry far away and serve the people wholeheartedly to the end.

    With the ideological burden put down, and all concerns gone, I felt very happy, and when I worked, I felt full of energy and became more and more fond of my job. Some comrades were very surprised to see my enthusiasm and asked me: "Little Tian, where do you get so much energy now?" I said: "It comes from reading Chairman Mao's books." From then on, the comrades slowly approached me and cared for me.

    At this time, I thought again, Chairman Mao's books cured my own ideological illness and improved my class consciousness, but this only made me better; if I used Chairman Mao's books to help everyone solve ideological problems and mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, wouldn't the effect be even greater? I discussed it with the team leader and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. I am the only one in our team who is a bit educated, so I will read to everyone.

    On the first day, I read with great difficulty, but when I looked, everyone was dozing off. I said to everyone: "Let's come earlier tomorrow to study." Everyone agreed.

    But when they came the next day, they sat together and started chatting about family matters again. I read Chairman Mao's works to everyone, and as I read, some people started dozing off again. I said angrily: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is for your own good, but you don't study hard."

    As soon as I said this, everyone started giving me their opinions. Some said: "You big intellectual, you just read on and on, who knows what you're reading?" Some said: "You come so early, you have your mother cooking at home, you're active and we're backward."

    When everyone gave their opinions, I felt that they were right. Changing the method would have a better effect. I discussed it with the team leader and changed it to studying every Monday and Friday. Each time we studied, we focused on the problems we had, and when we were afraid of difficulties, we studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and when we were afraid of giving opinions, we studied "Serve the People." I also took the initiative to talk about my own thoughts, and when everyone saw me talking, they followed suit.

    Comrade Wu Fengying in our team used to be unsettled at work. After studying Chairman Mao's works, her thinking improved and she made rapid progress. She used to think that pulling garbage was shameful. When she saw fellow villagers and acquaintances at work, she pulled her hat down low and wore her mask high. When her family wrote to her asking what job she did, she always refused to tell them. Every day after getting off work, she complained to her husband: "I ran over ten thousand miles with you, just to pull garbage for you here!" Because she was unsettled at work, she saw feces on the pedal twice when she went to sweep the toilet, and she cursed: "Damn it, this person's ass is crooked." Later, after studying "Serve the People" and with the help of the comrades, her thinking changed. She said: "Zhang Side ran twenty-five thousand miles, burned charcoal for the revolution, and finally gave his life. Cleaning work is also revolutionary work, and it is also serving the people, so why am I not content? I want to learn from Comrade Zhang Side and be a cleaning worker for the rest of my life." She also took the initiative to self-criticize to the comrades, saying: "I complained about the dirt and mess when I was cleaning the toilet, which is a manifestation of not wholeheartedly serving the people. If you want to serve the people, you can't be afraid of trouble." Wu Fengying's ideological awareness improved, and she became more active in her work.

    After that, we often persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works. During the day, while loading the trucks, I would read Chairman Mao's works to everyone after the trucks left. Sometimes everyone would talk about their experiences, and I would take notes. This greatly helped everyone's ideological improvement.

    Family Storm

    After the personal ideological problem was solved, a storm arose in the family. At this time, my husband had an argument with me and wouldn't let me work anymore.

    My husband is thirty-six years old this year. He doesn't recognize many characters, has a relatively violent temper, and has been deeply influenced by the old society. He has feudal remnants of thought and has never wanted me to participate in work. Later, when he saw that other family members were participating in labor, he reluctantly agreed after I discussed it with him.

    After I started working, he would run back from the drilling site every time he had a rest, asking me to ask for leave and go to the movies with him. At first, I agreed to everything. When I didn't go to work, I would ask someone to ask for leave for me, saying that I wasn't feeling well or had something else to do. But later, my ideological awareness improved, and I felt that this was not conducive to work.

    Once, when he was resting, he wouldn't let me go to work. I patiently said to him: "Work is very busy now. Unless there is something special, I shouldn't ask for leave."

    He said: "What's so busy about pulling garbage? If you can't finish it today, you can pull it tomorrow."

    I asked him: "What if you can't finish it tomorrow?"

    He said: "If you can't finish it tomorrow, you can pull it the day after tomorrow."

    I said again: "Wouldn't that accumulate more and more?"

    He said threateningly: "Forget it! Forget it! If you want to go, go, don't tell me so many great principles."

    In this way, he wouldn't let me, and I wouldn't let him, and the two of us quarreled.

    He said: "I know your heart has changed. You used to do whatever I asked you to do, but now you've only been working for a few days, and you're holding your head so high that you even look down on your own man."

    I said: "It's not that I look down on you because I've started working. What you said is not good for work, so I don't listen to you."

    He also said: "Our life is not really difficult, can't we still live without you working? I make more than a hundred yuan a month, isn't that enough for you to spend?"

    I said: "I'm not participating in work to earn that little bit of money, but to make revolution."

    From then on, the two of us would quarrel as soon as we met. I said his bourgeois thinking was too serious, and he said I was being falsely active. The phenomenon of disunity between the two of us became more and more serious, which added difficulties to life and brought pain to our thoughts. Later, he threatened me with divorce, asked me to go back to my hometown, asked me to move to Baijitan, and wouldn't let me work, etc. I thought, I didn't do anything bad, so I'm not afraid of what you do to me. After a few days, I thought to myself again, it's not a solution to just be at odds like this. To do my job well, I must get through my husband's thinking and solve the family problem.

    After that, I changed my attitude and tried my best to persuade him and cared for him and showed consideration for him in life. However, he still couldn't figure it out and kept quarreling with me.

    A few days later, I went to the drilling site and heard that he was in low spirits and dozing off during working hours. I was so angry that I was shaking and couldn't wait to scold him. Afterwards, I thought carefully, my thinking was cleared by Chairman Mao's works. His thinking is not clear, and it's useless to just argue with him. I should still help him study Chairman Mao's works and let Chairman Mao's thought illuminate him.

    A few days later, he came back. I took out the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and read it to him. Who knew that he would reach out and snatch the book away, saying: "This is my book, give it back to me. The more people study Chairman Mao's works, the better they become, but the more you study, the worse you become, studying to argue with me. Does Chairman Mao's book tell you to study well, or does it tell you to argue with me?"

    I asked him: "What haven't I learned well?"

    He couldn't say anything and just said: "You know yourself."

    This time when he left, he took all the money from the house with him. I wrote a letter to the responsible comrades in his team, telling them about the situation. After two days, a comrade from their team came to me to find out about the situation and asked me to write a detailed letter. After that comrade left, I wrote a second letter in detail.

    Then, I went to the drilling site for the second time to find out about his ideological situation, help him wash his clothes, and study Chairman Mao's works. According to his ideological situation at the time, I mainly helped him study "Combat Liberalism." I first told him what harm liberalism has in our work, and then I read it to him item by item. He smiled every time I read an item. I asked him every time I read an item: Do you have this kind of thinking? He just smiled. After reading it, he said with a smile: "These eleven items almost all fit my thinking."

    I asked him: "What are you going to do?"

    He said: "In the future, I will be determined to throw away liberalist thoughts."

    In fact, his ideological transformation was not really implemented at that time. A few days after I returned from the drilling site, he came back to Karamay. Knowing that I had written a letter to his leader, he had a big opinion about me. He said: "You wrote a letter to report me, you are intentionally trying to harm me."

    I said: "I didn't want to harm you, but to help you progress."

    He also said: "If you want to divorce me, just bring it up."

    I said: "What's the use of divorce? Can divorce solve ideological problems? With your kind of thinking, I wouldn't be at ease even if we divorced."

    He left the next day. I was worried, so I went to the drilling site a few days later to help him. In this way, with the help of the leaders, we studied Chairman Mao's works together many times and talked heart-to-heart together, and his ideological awareness gradually improved. From then on, he came back every two weeks, and he never quarreled with me again when he came back.

    Once, when he came back, he asked me: "Are you a five-good this month?"

    I asked him: "Are you a five-good this month?"

    He said: "I'm not good enough yet, I was rated as a four-good this month."

    I said: "Don't be discouraged if you're rated as a four-good, you have to continue to work hard, and you have to overcome your shortcomings."

    He said: "I'm not discouraged, my confidence is great, I want to catch up with you and surpass you. Our team all praised you and told me to learn from you."

    He also said to me: "When people make progress and achieve results, it is easy to become arrogant. I hope that you will keep Chairman Mao's words in mind when you make some achievements, don't be proud, and continue to move forward."

    When the two of us are united, he also strongly supports me in my work.

    When Thoughts are Put into Practice, Work is Excellent

    In our team, there are many comrades who have experienced such tortuous ideological struggles and family struggles as I have. It is all because they have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works, which has not only solved their own ideological problems, but also solved various external ideological obstacles, and after a relatively long period of labor training, their level of ideological understanding has gradually improved, and their idea of serving the people has gradually strengthened, and they have become more and more fond of cleaning work. The comrades all said: "Now when we see a dirty place in the city, we can't put our hearts down; we feel comfortable in our hearts when we clean it up, even if we are a little tired."

    In the past, because ideological problems were not solved, the operation of cleaning the latrine was not careful, the mouth of the can was not covered, and wherever it went, it spilled and stank. When pulling garbage, it would dump a large pile from this garbage dump to that garbage dump. There were no requirements, no standards, and no one cared whether it was done well or badly. Now, our awareness has gradually increased, and everyone is working hard to practice basic skills and is carrying out regular operations in a big way. Cleaning the latrine has formed a new set of operating procedures and work standards, achieving stability, accuracy, speed, and cleanliness. Stability means that every scoop of feces is held steady and not spilled on the ground; accuracy means that every scoop of feces is lifted up and aligned with the mouth of the can and poured in, not spilled outside the can, and the spoon does not touch the mouth of the can; speed means that it is quick to scoop, quick to lift, quick to hook up the cart, and quick to release it at the destination; cleanliness means that the ground is clean after the can cart leaves and does not overflow on the way. We have also taken many measures in pulling garbage.

    In August last year, the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration named our Cleaning Team Three as a Five-Good Red Banner Team. We are determined to continue to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, humbly learn from Daqing, and devote ourselves to cleaning work for a lifetime for the sake of revolution, for the sake of improving the sanitation of the mining area, ensuring the health of the broad masses of workers and staff, and better promoting production.

### 我的思想革命和我的家庭革命

    我的思想革命和我的家庭革命
    田爱珍
    编者按　这篇文章，说的是一个职工家属，在毛泽东思想哺育下，在集体生产过程中，逐步改造思想，成为先进分子的经历。材料很生动，非常口语化，建议大家一读。
    两年前，田爱珍同志还是一个思想不那么进步的职工家属。她刚参加集体生产的时候，拈轻怕重，很不安心。后来，经过学习毛泽东同志著作，经过比较长期的劳动锻炼，阶级觉悟逐步提高，进步很快；不但自己进步，还帮助丈夫进步，帮助其他同志进步。在不久以前召开的西北区工业交通会议上，田爱珍同志被评为西北工业交通战线上的一面红旗。
    有些思想落后的职工家属，常常在家庭日常生活中，对职工的思想起某些消极影响。重要原因之一，就是她们长期脱离集体生产，束缚在家庭的小圈子里。大庆职工家属革命化的经验，田爱珍自我改造的经历，都告诉我们，要对职工家属实行思想改造，就必须组织职工家属参加集体生产。组织职工家属参加集体生产，不仅可以促进职工家属革命化，对于职工队伍的革命化也有积极作用。
    各地工矿企业应该根据具体情况，把职工家属组织起来，参加力所能及的生产劳动，各尽所能，各得其所，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设增加新的力量。
      我是新疆石油管理局的职工家属，是两个孩子的妈妈。一九六四年三月，我们那里很多职工家属都参加了集体生产劳动，我就想：自己年轻轻的，天天呆在家里有啥意思？也报名参加了克拉玛依服务公司清洁三队当清洁工人。
    从不安心工作到安心工作
    开始，我认为清洁工作没有啥，就是把垃圾打扫打扫，装上车拉到戈壁滩就行了。看到别人拉小车挺轻快，象坐轿一样。但是，实际一干，并不象原来想的那么简单。
    第一天拉着小车到垃圾堆去装垃圾，那里边什么味道都有。灰土一扬，简直呛的喘不过气来。车子装好了，得费很大力气才能拉着走，路上一点都不听自己使唤。别的同志拉满满的一车，不费劲拉着就跑，我就不行，遇到上坡路拉不上去，下坡路又不敢下。在这时，自己才知道这个活不是好干的。
    咬着牙干了三天，累得腰酸腿疼，胳膊抬不起来啦。这时，我就不想干了。可是，不干又怕丢人。报名那阵说了自己不怕脏不怕累，现在想打退堂鼓，怎么好意思开口呢？我就背着这个思想包袱，拉了一个多月的小车。
    有一天，听说队里决定用小车把垃圾集中到一块，再用翻斗汽车往外运。我高兴极了。心想：装车这活总比拉小车轻一些，也干净些。过了几天，当队上决定抽一部分人装汽车时，我第一个抢着报名装车。
    到装车班后，装了一天车，才知道自己没找到“窍门”，没占上“便宜”。装汽车比拉小车还脏还累。这时，自己就气得不得了，埋怨自己不该到装车班去。但是现在后悔也来不及了，只好硬着头皮干吧。
    以后，对这个工作一点信心也没有了。每天赌着气去上班，下班就给母亲耍脾气。母亲看透了我的心思，她说：“干活累了，快坐下歇歇吧！干什么工作都是头三步难行，习惯了就好啦。”
    我不管母亲怎么说，每天上班干活还是疲疲沓沓。没有灰，我就装车；一有灰，我就不装，站到旁边看。别人给我提意见，我不接受，甚至对别人不满。班长教育我也不听。班长没办法，就把这情况反映到队部。
    队长找我说：“小田，你们班对你意见很大，你知道吗？”
    我说：“不知道。”
    队长说：“你今后要不好好干，非把你调到别的队去不行。”
    我听了这话，心里高兴极了：哪个队也比这个队好，比这个队的工作干净。以后我就故意不好好干，想把同志们、班长、队长他们肚子都气得大大的。气狠了，他们就会把我调出去。
    过了几天，听不到往外调的消息。我等不得了，找到队长说：“队长，给我调个工作吧，这个工作我实在干不了。”
    队长生气地说：“你干得了也得干，干不了也得干。”
    我听了转身就走。心里想，你当个队长有什么了不起的，还不是和我一样，也是个家属？我高兴干了就装上两下，不高兴我就站一边休息，看你队长能把我怎么样？只要每天上班，照样得发工资，少给我一分都不行。
    一九六五年初，在我思想包袱背得最严重的时候，领导和同志们对我进行了帮助和教育，叫我和大家一起学习大庆家属参加劳动的事迹。学习后，我脑子一震：人家薛大娘年纪那么大，干工作不计报酬，我一个年轻人还不如个老大娘？
    这时，钻井处正搞社会主义教育运动，我母亲也参加了。有一天晚上我问她开什么会，她说是新旧社会回忆对比。接着，母亲就说起解放前后家庭的情况。
    解放前，我家是很穷的，经常是吃上顿没下顿。尽管这样，地主恶霸还是不断地找我们的麻烦，欺负我们。我父亲会做瓦工活，有时打短工挣下两个钱，他们一看见就想办法勒索。有几次，他们把父亲关起来，母亲只得到处借钱，把家里的东西都卖了，把父亲赎回来。一九四九年家乡解放，打倒了恶霸地主，这才过上了好日子。但是，父亲的身体因为在旧社会被折磨得太严重了，得了痨病，尽管政府尽了很大的力，给吃好药，打好针，还是没有能治好。
    母亲一说起这些，使我也回忆起来。当时我只有十二三岁，父亲临死时拉着我的红领巾说：“孩子，共产党和毛主席使我们得到了光明，希望你不要忘本，好好学习，长大成人报答共产党和毛主席的恩情。”回忆起这些事情，想想现在，感到很难过。自己七八年来没有为人民做什么事情，现在参加工作了，又怕脏怕累，不好好干。我知道自己完全错了。
    思想觉悟了，我就开始学习毛主席著作。学了《纪念白求恩》之后，自己想，白求恩是一个外国人，为中国革命献出生命；自己是中国人，又是怎样对待工作呢？我感到毛主席说的：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的”这些话，好象就是对自己说的一样。以后，我就比较安心工作了。
    后来，我们队里又组织大家学习北京掏粪工人时传祥的先进事迹。刘少奇主席接见时传祥时说：“你当清洁工人是人民的勤务员，我当主席也是人民的勤务员。”这个教导，使我懂得了一个根本的道理，就是在我们的社会里，干什么工作都是为人民服务，干好了，就是服好了务。拉垃圾掏大粪就是干革命，就是具体的为人民服务。更从心坎里认识到：只有肮脏的思想，没有肮脏的工作。
    从这以后，我决心永远听毛主席的话，牢记阶级苦，认真学习时传祥，保持和发扬劳动人民的本色，党叫干啥就干啥，坚决当好清洁工。
    从自己进步到帮助别人进步
    我安心工作以后，不等于没有缺点了。
    第一个缺点就是不接受批评。班长给我提意见，我还能接受；同志们给我提意见，就接受不了。
    以后，自己就想：为什么同志们提意见自己接受不了呢？毛主席教导我们说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”和自己的思想一对照，自己知道又错了。在这时自己就问自己：你读了毛主席的书，听不听毛主席的教导呢？不接受别人的批评，这样做是不符合毛主席的教导的，是错误的，要坚决改掉这个坏毛病。于是，我就主动向全班同志作了检讨。
    这个缺点克服了，自己思想上又产生了一个顾虑，觉得自己的身体不好，干活没有别人的力气大。别人装一车垃圾都不喘气，我装上半车就上气不接下气的，只好站住喘一口气再装。自己想，别人都不停，光我停，别人会不会对我有意见呢？说我的闲话咋办？自己想把工作搞好，可是没有那么大的力量又怎么办呢？想来想去，干脆还是干别的工作吧。但是我又想，这是不是符合毛主席的教导呢？与毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文的教导一联系，知道自己的想法又错了。人的力量是不会一样的，自己的力量虽然小，但只要有毫无自私自利之心的精神，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。因此，下定决心把这个顾虑扔的远远的，全心全意为人民服务到底。
    思想包袱放下了，一切顾虑也没有了，精神感到非常愉快，干起活来浑身是劲，越干越热爱自己的工作。有的同志看到我这个干劲非常惊奇，就问我：“小田，现在你那来这么大的劲呀？”我说：“这是读毛主席的书得来的。”从此以后，同志们就慢慢地靠近我，爱护我。
    这时候我又想，毛主席的书治好了我自己的思想病，提高了我的阶级觉悟，但这也只不过是我一个人好；如果用毛主席的书帮助大家解决思想问题，调动大家的积极性，不是作用就更大了吗？我就和班长商量，组织大家学习毛主席著作。我们班就我有点文化，就由我给大家读。
    第一天，我读的挺费劲，可一看，大家都打瞌睡了。我就对大家说：“明天咱们来早点学。”大家同意了。
    可是第二天一来，坐到一块又拉开家常了。我给大家读毛主席著作，读着读着，一些人又打起瞌睡来。我生气地说：“学习毛主席著作是为了你们好，可你们不好好学。”
    这一说，大家就冲我提开意见啦。有的说：“你这大知识分子，光哗啦哗啦读，谁知道你读的啥？”有的说：“来的那么早，你家里有母亲做饭，你积极我们落后。”
    大家一提，我觉得提的对。改变方法，效果就会好。我和班长商量，改成每星期一、五学习。每次学习都针对我们存在的问题学，怕困难，就学《愚公移山》，怕提意见，就学《为人民服务》。我还主动联系自己的思想去谈，大家看我谈，也跟着谈起来。
    我们班里的吴凤英同志，过去不安心工作，经过学习毛主席著作后，思想提高了，进步很快。她原先认为拉垃圾见不得人，工作时见了老乡和熟人，就把帽子拉得低低的，口罩戴得高高的。家里来信问她干什么工作，她一直不肯告诉。每天下班回到家里还埋怨爱人说：“我跟你跑了一万多里路，到这里给你拉垃圾！”由于不安心工作，有两次去扫厕所时，看见踏板上有粪便，她就骂：“他妈的，这个人屁股长歪了。”后来学了《为人民服务》，又经过同志们的帮助，思想起了变化，她说：“张思德跑了两万五千里，为了革命烧炭，最后献出了生命。我搞清洁工作也是革命工作，也是为人民服务，为什么就不安心呢？我要向张思德同志学习，当一辈子清洁工人。”她还主动向同志们检讨说：“打扫厕所嫌脏乱骂人，这是没有全心全意为人民服务的思想表现，为人民服务就不能怕麻烦。”吴凤英的思想觉悟提高了，工作也积极起来。
    以后，我们就经常坚持毛主席著作学习。白天装车，车子一走，我就给大家读毛主席著作。有时大家谈谈心得，我就作记录。这样，对大家的思想提高帮助很大。
    家庭风波
    个人思想问题解决了，家里又起了风波。这时，我爱人和我闹意见，不让我工作了。
    我爱人今年三十六岁，不识几个字，性子比较暴躁，在旧社会受的影响深，有封建残余思想，从来不愿我参加工作。后来见到别的家属都参加了劳动，我和他商量，他才勉强同意了。
    我参加工作后，他每到休息时就从钻井处跑回来，要我请假和他一块去看电影。开始我都答应了，不上班就叫人代我请个假，说不舒服或有别的事情。但是后来，我的思想觉悟提高了，感到这样不利于工作。
    有一次他休息，又不让我上班，我耐心地对他说：“现在工作很忙，没有特殊的事情，能不请假就不请假。”
    他说：“拉垃圾的有啥忙的？今天拉不完明天再拉。”
    我问他：“明天拉不完呢？”
    他说：“明天拉不完后天拉。”
    我又说：“那不越积越多吗？”
    他就气势汹汹地说：“算啦！算啦！你高兴去你就去吧，别和我讲那么多大道理。”
    就这样，他不让我，我不让他，两个人吵了起来。
    他说：“我知道你的心变了，从前叫你干啥就干啥，可现在自己才工作几天，头就抬那么高，连自己的男人都看不起。”
    我说：“不是我参加工作了就看不起你。你说的那些话对工作没有利，所以我就不听你的。”
    他又说：“我们生活又不是真正困难，你不参加工作还不是照样生活？我一个月一百多元，还不够你花的？”
    我说：“我并不是为了挣那两个钱才参加工作，而是为了革命才参加工作。”
    从此以后，我们两人一见面说不上两句话就吵架，我说他资产阶级思想太严重，他说我是假积极。两个人不团结的现象越来越严重，给生活增加了困难，也给思想带来痛苦。以后他提出离婚来威胁我，让我回老家去，让我搬到白碱滩去，不让我工作等。我想，我没做坏事，你怎么着我都不害怕。过了几天，自己又想，光这样别扭下去也不是办法，要想把工作搞好，必须打通爱人的思想，把家庭问题解决好。
    以后，我改变了态度，尽力说服他，从生活上关心他、体贴他。可是，他还是想不通，老跟我吵。
    过了两天，我到钻井处去，听说他的情绪不高，工作时间打瞌睡，我气得直发抖，恨不得说他一顿。事后，我仔细地想了想，自己的思想是用毛主席著作打通的。他的思想不通，光和他顶也没用，还是帮助他学毛主席著作，让毛主席思想去照亮他。
    又过了几天，他回来了。我就拿《纪念白求恩》这篇文章念给他听。谁知他竟伸手把书抢走了，说：“这是我的书，还给我。人家学毛主席著作越学越好，你越学越坏，学着和我闹意见。毛主席的书是叫你学好，还是叫你和我闹意见的？”
    我问他：“我那点没学好？”
    他没辞了，只好说：“你自己知道。”
    这次他走时，把家里的钱全都带走了。我就给他们队的负责同志写了一封信，告诉了这些情况。过了两天，他们队上的一个同志来找我了解情况，并叫我详细地写封信去。那个同志走后，我又详细地写了第二封信。
    接着，我第二次到钻井处去，了解他的思想情况，帮助他洗衣服，学习毛主席著作。根据他当时的思想情况，主要帮助他学习《反对自由主义》。我先给他讲自由主义在我们工作中有什么危害性，接着就一条条给他读。念一条，他就笑一笑。我每念一条就问他一条：有没有这种思想？他只是笑。读完后，他笑着说：“这十一条差不多都符合我的思想。”
    我问他：“你准备怎么办哪！”
    他说：“以后下定决心把自由主义思想扔掉。”
    其实，那时他的思想改造并没有真正落实。我从钻井处回来没几天，他又回克拉玛依来了，知道我给他的领导去信，对我意见可大啦。他说：“你写信告我，是有意害我。”
    我说：“我并不是想害你，而是为了帮助你进步。”
    他又说：“你要想跟我离婚，就干脆提出来吧。”
    我说：“离婚顶什么用？离婚能解决思想问题吗？象你这样的思想，就是离了婚我也不放心。”
    第二天他就走了。我不放心，过了几天又去钻井处帮助他。就这样，经过领导的帮助，我俩多次一起学习毛主席著作，一起谈心，他的思想觉悟逐步提高。从此后，他每隔两星期回来一次，回来再也不和我吵架了。
    有一次，他回来问我：“这个月你是不是五好？”
    我问他：“这个月你是不是五好？”
    他说：“我还不够，这个月评了个四好。”
    我说：“评四好不要灰心，要继续努力，有缺点要克服。”
    他说：“我才不灰心呢，我的信心大了，我要赶上你超过你。我们队都夸你好，都让我向你学习。”
    他还对我说：“人有了进步，取得成绩，很容易自高自大起来。我希望你做出一点成绩，要牢记毛主席的话，不要骄傲，要继续前进。”
    我俩团结好了，在工作上他也大力支持我了。
    思想落了实，工作就过硬
    在我们队里，象经历过我这样曲折的思想斗争和家庭斗争的同志很多。都是由于认真学习了毛主席著作，既解决了自己的思想问题，又解决了各种外来的思想阻力，加上经过一段较长时间的劳动锻炼，思想认识水平逐步提高，为人民服务的思想逐步加强，对清洁工作越来越热爱了。同志们都说：“现在看见市区内有个脏的地方，我们的心就放不下；累一点把它打扫干净了，心里才舒坦。”
    过去由于思想问题没有解决，掏大粪操作不细心，罐口不加盖，走到那洒到那，也臭到那。拉垃圾从这个垃圾堆到那个垃圾堆，一倒一大片。没有要求，没有标准，干好干坏也没人管。现在，我们的觉悟逐步提高，人人苦练基本功，大搞正规操作。掏大粪形成了一套新的操作规程和工作标准，做到了稳、准、快、净。稳，就是每勺子粪便端的稳，不洒在地上；准，就是每勺子粪便提起来对准罐口倒入，不洒在罐外，勺子不碰罐口；快，就是掏得快，提得快，挂车快，拉到终点放得快；净，就是罐车走了地面净，途中不溢出。在拉垃圾方面，我们也采取了不少措施。
    去年八月，新疆石油管理局党委命名我们清洁三队为五好红旗队，我们决心继续活学活用毛主席著作，虚心学习大庆，为了革命，为了搞好矿区的卫生，保证广大职工身体健康，更好地促进生产，干一辈子清洁工作。
