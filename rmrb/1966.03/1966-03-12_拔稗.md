    Uprooting Barnyard Grass
    Wei Qiao
    Anyone who has grown rice knows how annoying barnyard grass is. A single barnyard grass plant monopolizes the surrounding fertilizer, growing thick and strong. However, barnyard grass is very difficult to get rid of. It is said that if barnyard grass is eaten by cattle, turned into manure, and spread on the ground, it will still sprout and grow. Therefore, people have a saying: "Farm until you're old, barnyard grass cannot be eliminated."
    However, in the early and late rice fields of several hundred mu in Fengshan Brigade, Anping Commune, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, not a single barnyard grass plant could be found, which has been praised by visitors from all over. Their experience in eliminating barnyard grass is simple: relying on a pair of hands to pull it out. When the rice seeds have not yet fallen into the mud, the women in the brigade select the grains, removing the barnyard grass seeds; in the seedling fields, despite the chill of early spring, they always go to pull them out repeatedly; when transplanting seedlings, they carefully pay attention to removing barnyard grass; even in the season when the rice waves roll and the grains mature, as long as there is barnyard grass, they still go to the fields to pull it out. Not only in the fields and on the edges of the fields, but even on the ground, they are pulled clean. In this way, they finally eliminated the "un-eliminable" barnyard grass.
    To eliminate barnyard grass in the fields, one must first eliminate the "un-eliminable" "barnyard grass" in one's mind. Once the "barnyard grass" in the mind is eliminated, the barnyard grass in the fields will not be able to stay.
    Relying on hands, being meticulous, and persistently uprooting barnyard grass is also a manifestation of the Dazhai spirit. The experience of Fengshan Brigade in eliminating barnyard grass proves that to do a good job in production, the Dazhai spirit is indispensable in matters large and small.
    Everyone has a pair of hands. Under the leadership of the Party, as long as we firmly believe in our own hands and rely on our own hands, any "barnyard grass" in the world can be uprooted!

    拔稗
    魏桥
    种过水稻的人，谁都厌恶稗草。一株稗草独吞了周围的肥料，长得又粗又壮。但是，稗草很不易除掉。据说，稗草被牛吃了，变成粪，拉在地上，还会发芽、生长。因此，人们流传这样的话：“种田种到老，稗草除不了。”
    可是，浙江诸暨县安平公社凤山大队，几百亩早稻、晚稻田里，却找不到一株稗草，受到了各地参观者的称赞。他们除稗的经验，说来也简单，就是靠一双手拔。当谷种还未落泥的时候，队里妇女就进行粒选，剔除稗种；在秧田里，尽管春寒料峭，他们总是几次三番地去拔；插秧的时候，他们又精心地注意除稗；就是在稻浪翻滚谷子成熟的季节，只要有稗，还是下田去拔。不仅田里、田边，连地上也都拔得干干净净。就是这样，终于除掉了“除不了”的稗草。
    要除掉田里的稗草，先要除掉思想上“除不了”这株“稗草”。思想上的“稗草”除掉了，田里的稗草也就留不住了。
    依靠双手，一丝不苟，坚持拔稗，这也是大寨精神的一种表现。凤山大队除稗的经验证明，要把生产搞好，在大小问题上都少不了大寨精神。
    人人都有一双手。在党的领导下，只要坚信自己的一双手，依靠自己一双手，世界上的任何“稗草”都能拔掉！
