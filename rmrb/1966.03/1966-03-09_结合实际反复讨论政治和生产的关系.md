    Editor's Note: Currently, many regions are carrying out discussions on the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production. This is very necessary. The question of what position to put politics in is a fundamental one. Only by clarifying and resolving this issue can everyone truly realize that politics is the commander, is the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and can we achieve politics commanding everything and Mao Zedong Thought commanding everything.
    How can we ensure that the discussion of the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production, is carried out well? Judging from the report on the Shuikou Commune in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, published in today's newspaper, there are two points to note:
    First, closely integrate with reality. Every comrade has successful experiences and failed lessons in their work. By comparing and analyzing these two aspects, we can see which ones are in line with Mao Zedong Thought and were done correctly, and which ones are not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and were done wrong. In this way, we will deepen our understanding of the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production.
    Second, through practice. Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Only through practice can people truly and deeply understand the importance of highlighting politics. Comrade Huang Hai, Secretary of the Shuikou Commune Party Committee, said it well: In the past, my understanding of the importance of highlighting politics was relatively abstract. Now, after practice, with the living example of the Wu'ai Brigade, I deeply realize that only by highlighting politics and arming the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought can production truly be done well. Comrade Huang Hai's experience shows that practice is a continuation of this discussion, and an even more important discussion.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A correct understanding often requires many repetitions of the process from matter to spirit, and from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to knowledge, and from knowledge to practice, before it can be completed. This is the Marxist epistemology, the epistemological of dialectical materialism.” When discussing the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production, we must act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings.

    According to a report in the Southern Daily, the Party Committee Secretary and the Party Branch Secretaries of the brigades of Shuikou Commune in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, recently conducted a second discussion on the relationship between politics and production. The discussion showed that the issue of the relationship between politics and production cannot be resolved through one discussion; highlighting politics cannot be implemented through one discussion, and it requires close integration with reality and repeated discussions. Only in this way can people gradually deepen their understanding and consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and guide production and work.

    Last autumn, Shuikou Commune held a discussion on the relationship between politics and production at a three-level cadre meeting. Everyone's understanding of the great significance of highlighting politics has improved, but the problem has not been completely resolved. At that time, some comrades' thinking was not clear, some comrades were skeptical, holding a "wait and see" attitude. Some comrades went to the production teams, but only carried Chairman Mao's writings as a formality. Some comrades felt that when production was busy, politics should give way to production. For example, after the discussion, the enthusiasm of cadres and masses in Fancun Brigade to study Chairman Mao's writings gradually increased. After entering the busy farming season, some people proposed that "political work should give way," and they wavered in highlighting politics. The Dengwuwei Third Production Team and the Miaoxia Second Production Team in this brigade also used methods of awarding fresh fish and awarding work points to replace political work, attempting to use it to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses. These situations aroused the attention of the commune party committee, which believed that it was necessary to conduct another discussion.

    Purely material assistance creates passive dependence
    Firmly grasp politics to boost the spirit of self-reliance
    The topic of this discussion was still: Is highlighting politics really important? After several months of practice, many comrades have had personal experiences and new understandings.

    Huang Hai, Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, used the changes in the Wu'ai Brigade last year's early and late rice crops as an example, providing a very convincing answer: Wu'ai Brigade's production has not improved in the past two years. Last year, the Commune Party Committee sent two Party Committee members to be stationed in the brigade, adopting the method of supplementing whatever was lacking and giving whatever was needed to help them with production. As a result, it fostered a sense of dependence among the cadres. For example, during the early rice crop, when they encountered drought, the Xiaobei River flowed through here, and it was entirely possible to use manpower to carry water to fight the drought. However, the cadres of this brigade said: "Without a water pump, we can't fight the drought." They did not take action and only waited for the commune to send a water pump. The stationed cadres and commune leaders did not seize these active thoughts to conduct political and ideological education, but instead transferred a water pump, paid for the diesel fuel, and even delivered the wood for building the pump shed. As a result, the cadres and commune members' sense of dependence became more serious, and they relied solely on the water pump, canceling the method of manual water carrying. As a result, more than 250 mu of rice fields in the entire brigade suffered reduced yields because the water pump could not irrigate them. After the first discussion on the relationship between politics and production last autumn, the Commune Party Committee studied Chairman Mao's writings with this issue in mind, summarized experiences and lessons, and realized that leading production must highlight politics and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members. When this brigade needed to irrigate the late rice crop, the commune leaders no longer supplied whatever was lacking or gave whatever was needed, as they had done in the past. Instead, they mobilized the cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's writings, talk about the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, and strengthen the revolutionary spirit of the cadres and commune members. In this way, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle was promoted. Poor peasant commune member Hu Mei said: "We have hundreds of commune members, hundreds of hands, and hundreds of shoulders. We can irrigate the water even without a water pump!" Later, the commune members worked early and late to carry water and scoop water to irrigate the fields. As a result, the entire brigade increased production by more than 24,000 jin.

    By comparing the changes in the early and late rice crops of the Wu'ai Brigade, Comrade Huang Hai said with deep emotion: "In the past, my understanding of the importance of highlighting politics was relatively abstract. Now, after practice, with the living example of the Wu'ai Brigade, I deeply realize that only by highlighting politics and arming the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought can production truly be done well."

    The masses study Chairman Mao's writings, and the revolutionary spirit is greatly boosted.
    Practice proves that production cannot be done well without relying on politics.
    Li Ruichi, the party branch secretary of Huangchi Brigade, also talked about new experiences. During the last discussion, he once asserted: "Politics cannot fill the stomach. If you have enough to eat, you can even get a stone mill up a mountain." At that time, although he could not figure out the issue of highlighting politics, he felt that it was "the trend of the times," so he adopted a "wait and see" attitude. After returning, he organized the commune members to study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Once the masses studied, their revolutionary spirit was greatly boosted, and a vibrant scene appeared everywhere. Seeing this scene, the seventy-year-old poor peasant Li Qian said excitedly to him: "Ruichi, if you had led our commune members to read Chairman Mao's books earlier, the poor face of Huangchi would have changed even faster!" After hearing what the old poor peasant said, he did not sleep well all night. The next day, he and several branch committee members discussed it and felt that the brigade's increase in production in recent years was not large, and although there were many reasons, the fundamental one was the failure to highlight politics. He said: "Although politics cannot directly fill the stomach, production cannot be done well without relying on politics."

    He also talked about such a thing: When they called for winter planting of green manure last year, some cadres initially had the idea of relying solely on chemical fertilizers for production. They emphasized that there was no habit of planting green manure locally, were afraid of difficulties, and were unwilling to plant more. The party branch organized everyone to study the article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Everyone said: Solving fertilizer problems through self-reliance, reducing production costs, and increasing the income of commune members is the most realistic and important issue of caring about the well-being of the masses. No matter how great the difficulties, we must overcome them. They said what they did, and everyone went down to the production teams overnight and studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with the commune members, and spoke about the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, and mobilized the commune members to plant more green manure. Once the revolutionary spirit was promoted, the commune members were enthusiastic, and the entire brigade planted more than 1,160 mu of green manure in one go, more than six times the amount of green manure planted in the winter of the previous year.

    Backward teams are backward primarily because their political work is backward.
    Putting politics in command will have immediate results.
    During the last discussion, there was also such an opinion: Advanced teams have a high level of mass consciousness and can highlight politics; backward teams have a low level of mass consciousness, and talking about politics will not be listened to. Now, this opinion is also untenable.

    Cheng Shiyang, Deputy Secretary of the Dali Brigade Party Branch, used his brigade as an example to illustrate that what the backward team lacks is not the masses, but that the cadres have not done a good job in political work; if political work is truly done well, it will surely have immediate results. The natural conditions of the Dali Brigade are the worst in the entire commune. In recent years, the production face of this brigade has not changed much, the relationship between cadres and the masses is not harmonious, and the masses' production mood is low. At the beginning of last year, when other brigades were bustling with activity in preparing for farming, this brigade was deserted, and many people lost confidence in doing a good job in production. After the Spring Festival, with the help of a Commune Party Committee member, the Brigade Party Branch organized everyone to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "Combat Liberalism," focusing on the ideological situation of cadres and masses at that time. Through study, the ideological awareness of cadres and masses was improved. The cadres realized that they had not led production well in the past, and that the commune members had opinions, but they not only did not humbly examine themselves, but also did not want to be cadres. This was a manifestation of a lack of the spirit of serving the people. The commune members realized that they had not actively done a good job in production in the past, and that it was not conducive to unity and production to have opinions about the cadres but not raise them in person and talk nonsense behind their backs. This was a manifestation of liberalism. From then on, the cadres consciously corrected their mistakes, the commune members supported the cadres, and a warm atmosphere of unity in production appeared in the entire brigade. They stormed the place for five or six days and prepared more than 1,000 mu of rice fields. When there was a shortage of fertilizer, everyone actively sold household fertilizer and accumulated soil and miscellaneous fertilizer. Many cadres and commune members took the initiative to invest their savings in the team in order to help the team solve the problem of insufficient production funds.

    Through the second discussion, many cadres of Shuikou Commune have a new understanding of highlighting politics, and the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's writings has been improved. They have all arranged study time and stipulated that they must study at every meeting and study before discussing problems. The Commune Party Committee also appointed the Commune Cadres and the Brigade Party Branch Secretaries as the core to establish a political work organization responsible for tutoring and helping production team cadres and commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way.

### 结合实际反复讨论政治和生产的关系

专栏：

    结合实际反复讨论政治和生产的关系
    水口公社许多干部逐步加深认识，自觉用毛泽东思想改造自己指导生产
    编者按：目前，许多地区正在开展政治和业务、政治和生产的关系的讨论。这是十分必要的。把政治摆在什么地位的问题，是一个根本问题。只有把这个问题辩明了，解决了，才能使大家真正认识到政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，才能做到政治统帅一切，毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    怎样才能使政治和业务、政治和生产的关系的讨论进行得好呢？从本报今天发表的广东省阳山县水口公社的报道来看，有两点是要注意的：
    第一，密切联系实际。我们每一个同志在工作中都有成功的经验，也有失败的教训。把这两方面的情况，加以对比，加以分析，就可以看出那些是合于毛泽东思想的，做对了；那些是不合于毛泽东思想的，做错了。这样，就会加深对政治和业务、政治和生产的关系的理解。
    第二，经过实践。实践是检验真理的唯一标准。只有通过实践，人们才能真正深刻认识突出政治的重要性。水口公社党委书记黄海同志说得好：过去我对于突出政治的重要性，认识得比较抽象。现在经过实践，有了五爱大队这个活事例，我才深刻认识到：只有突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，生产才能真正搞得好。黄海同志的体会说明了，实践是这个讨论的继续，而且是更重要的讨论。
    毛泽东同志说：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。这就是马克思主义的认识论，就是辩证唯物论的认识论。”在讨论政治和业务、政治和生产的关系的时候，我们必须按照毛泽东同志的这一教导办事。
    据南方日报报道  广东省阳山县水口公社党委书记和大队党支部书记，最近就政治和生产的关系问题，进行了第二次讨论。讨论表明，政治和生产的关系问题，不是经过一次讨论就可以解决的；突出政治，不是经过一次讨论，就可以落实的，需要密切结合实际，反复讨论。只有这样，人们才能逐步加深认识，自觉地用毛泽东思想来改造自己，指导生产和工作。
    去年秋天，水口公社曾经在三级干部会议上，就政治和生产的关系问题，进行过一次讨论。大家对于突出政治的重大意义的认识有所提高，但是，还没有完全解决问题。当时有些同志思想就没有通，有些同志半信半疑，抱着“试试看”的态度。有些同志下生产队，虽然带上毛主席著作，只是作作样子。有些同志碰到生产大忙时，就要政治给生产让路。例如，樊村大队经过讨论后，干部和群众学习毛主席著作的积极性逐步提高。进入农忙季节后，有人就提出：“政治工作要让一下路”，他们对突出政治动摇了。这个大队的邓屋围第三生产队和庙下第二生产队，还用奖鲜鱼和奖工分的办法代替政治工作，企图用它来刺激群众积极性。这些情况引起了公社党委的重视，认为有必要再次进行讨论。
    单纯物质帮助造成消极依赖思想
    紧紧抓住政治振奋自力更生精神
    这次讨论的议题仍然是：突出政治到底重要不重要？经过几个月的实践，不少同志都有了亲身的体会和新的认识。
    公社党委书记黄海以五爱大队去年早晚两造的变化为例，提供了一个很有说服力的答案：五爱大队近两年生产上不去，去年公社党委就派两个党委委员驻在队里，采取缺什么就补什么、要什么就给什么的办法，帮助他们搞生产。结果助长了干部的依赖思想。例如，早造遇到天旱，本来小北江流经这里，完全可以用人力挑水抗旱。但是，这个大队的干部说：“没有抽水机就抗不了旱。”他们不动手，只等公社调抽水机来。驻队的干部和公社领导，没有抓住这些活思想进行政治思想教育，而是调去了一部抽水机，并且代付了柴油钱，甚至连搭抽水机工棚的木料也送上门。这样，干部和社员的依赖思想更严重了，单纯依靠抽水机，取消了人工挑水的办法。结果，全大队有二百五十多亩包麦，因抽水机灌不到水而减了产。去秋第一次讨论政治与生产的关系以后，公社党委带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，总结经验教训，明白了领导生产必须突出政治，充分调动干部和社员的积极性。这个大队在晚造需要浇水时，公社领导不再象过去那样缺啥给啥，要啥给啥，而是发动干部和社员学习毛主席著作，讲愚公移山的精神，长干部和社员的革命志气。这样一来，自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神就发扬起来。贫农社员胡眉说：“我们有几百个社员，几百双手，几百个肩头，没有抽水机也能浇上水！”以后，社员就起早摸黑挑水、戽水浇田，结果全大队共增产二万四千多斤。
    通过对比五爱大队早晚两造的变化，黄海同志深有感触地说：“过去我对突出政治的重要性，认识得比较抽象。现在经过实践，有了五爱大队这个活事例，我才深刻认识到：只有突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，生产才能真正搞得好。”
    群众学习毛主席著作革命精神大振
    实践证明要搞好生产非靠政治不可
    湟池大队党支部书记黎如翅，也谈了新体会。上次讨论时，他曾经认定：“政治不能饱肚，有饭吃饱，辘石头上山都可以。”当时他虽然对突出政治问题想不通，但是觉得“大势所趋”，便抱着“试试看”的态度。回去以后，组织社员学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章。群众一学习，革命精神大振，到处出现一片生气勃勃的景象。七十多岁的老贫农黎乾看到这般情景，激动地对他说：“如翅，你要是早带领我们社员读毛主席的书就好了，湟池的穷面貌会改变得更快！”听了老贫农这句话，他一夜没睡好。第二天，他和几个支委一议论，觉得这几年队里增产幅度不大，原因固然很多，根本的一条是没有突出政治。他说：“政治虽然不能直接饱肚，要搞好生产非靠政治不可。”
    他还谈了这样一件事：去年号召冬种绿肥的时候，起初有些干部存有单纯依赖化肥搞生产的思想，强调当地无种绿肥的习惯，害怕困难，不愿多种。党支部就组织大家学习《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇文章。大家说：自力更生解决肥料，降低生产成本，增加社员收入，这是关心群众生活最现实的大问题，困难再大也要克服。说干就干，大家连夜下到生产队，和社员一起学习《愚公移山》，大讲艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，发动社员多种绿肥。革命精神一发扬，社员们热情洋溢，全大队一鼓作气种下绿肥一千一百六十多亩，相当于前年冬种绿肥的六倍多。
    落后队首先是因为政治工作落后
    政治挂帅就会有立竿见影的效果
    在上次讨论时，还有这样一种意见：先进队群众觉悟高，可以突出政治；后进队群众觉悟低，讲政治听不入耳。现在，这种意见也站不住脚了。
    大里大队党支部副书记成什养以本大队为例，说明落后队落后的并不是群众，而是干部没有做好政治工作；要是政治工作真正做到家，就一定能够收到立竿见影的效果。大里大队的自然条件，是全公社最差的一个大队。近几年来，这个大队的生产面貌变化不大，干群关系不融洽，群众生产情绪低。去年初，别的大队热气腾腾备耕，这个大队却冷冷清清，很多人对搞好生产失去了信心。春节后，大队党支部在一个公社党委委员的帮助下，针对当时干部和群众的思想情况，组织大家学习《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》等文章。通过学习，干部和群众的思想觉悟提高了。干部认识到自己过去没有领导好生产，社员有意见，自己不但不虚心检查自己，反而不想当干部，这是缺乏为人民服务的精神的表现。社员认识到自己过去不积极搞好生产，对干部有意见当面不提背后乱说，不利于团结，不利于生产，这是自由主义的表现。从此，干部自觉改正错误，社员支持干部，全大队出现了团结搞生产的热烈气氛。他们突击五、六天，就把一千多亩包麦地整好。肥料不足，大家又积极交售家栏肥和积土杂肥。许多干部和社员为了帮助队里解决生产资金不足的问题，主动把自己的积蓄投给队里。
    通过第二次讨论，水口公社的许多干部对突出政治有了新的认识，学习毛主席著作的自觉性提高了。他们都安排了学习时间，规定逢会必学，研究问题先学。公社党委还指定以公社干部和大队党支部书记为核心，成立了政治工作机构，负责辅导、帮助生产队干部和社员活学活用毛主席著作。
