    Editor's Note: Currently, many regions are carrying out discussions on the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production. This is very necessary. The question of what position to put politics in is a fundamental one. Only by clarifying and resolving this issue can everyone truly realize that politics is the commander, is the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and can we achieve politics commanding everything and Mao Zedong Thought commanding everything.
    How can we ensure that the discussion of the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production, is carried out well? Judging from the report on the Shuikou Commune in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, published in today's newspaper, there are two points to note:
    First, closely integrate with reality. Every comrade has successful experiences and failed lessons in their work. By comparing and analyzing these two aspects, we can see which ones are in line with Mao Zedong Thought and were done correctly, and which ones are not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and were done wrong. In this way, we will deepen our understanding of the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production.
    Second, through practice. Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Only through practice can people truly and deeply understand the importance of highlighting politics. Comrade Huang Hai, Secretary of the Shuikou Commune Party Committee, said it well: In the past, my understanding of the importance of highlighting politics was relatively abstract. Now, after practice, with the living example of the Wu'ai Brigade, I deeply realize that only by highlighting politics and arming the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought can production truly be done well. Comrade Huang Hai's experience shows that practice is a continuation of this discussion, and an even more important discussion.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A correct understanding often requires many repetitions of the process from matter to spirit, and from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to knowledge, and from knowledge to practice, before it can be completed. This is the Marxist epistemology, the epistemological of dialectical materialism.‚Äù When discussing the relationship between politics and work, and politics and production, we must act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings.

    According to a report in the Southern Daily, the Party Committee Secretary and the Party Branch Secretaries of the brigades of Shuikou Commune in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, recently conducted a second discussion on the relationship between politics and production. The discussion showed that the issue of the relationship between politics and production cannot be resolved through one discussion; highlighting politics cannot be implemented through one discussion, and it requires close integration with reality and repeated discussions. Only in this way can people gradually deepen their understanding and consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and guide production and work.

    Last autumn, Shuikou Commune held a discussion on the relationship between politics and production at a three-level cadre meeting. Everyone's understanding of the great significance of highlighting politics has improved, but the problem has not been completely resolved. At that time, some comrades' thinking was not clear, some comrades were skeptical, holding a "wait and see" attitude. Some comrades went to the production teams, but only carried Chairman Mao's writings as a formality. Some comrades felt that when production was busy, politics should give way to production. For example, after the discussion, the enthusiasm of cadres and masses in Fancun Brigade to study Chairman Mao's writings gradually increased. After entering the busy farming season, some people proposed that "political work should give way," and they wavered in highlighting politics. The Dengwuwei Third Production Team and the Miaoxia Second Production Team in this brigade also used methods of awarding fresh fish and awarding work points to replace political work, attempting to use it to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses. These situations aroused the attention of the commune party committee, which believed that it was necessary to conduct another discussion.

    Purely material assistance creates passive dependence
    Firmly grasp politics to boost the spirit of self-reliance
    The topic of this discussion was still: Is highlighting politics really important? After several months of practice, many comrades have had personal experiences and new understandings.

    Huang Hai, Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, used the changes in the Wu'ai Brigade last year's early and late rice crops as an example, providing a very convincing answer: Wu'ai Brigade's production has not improved in the past two years. Last year, the Commune Party Committee sent two Party Committee members to be stationed in the brigade, adopting the method of supplementing whatever was lacking and giving whatever was needed to help them with production. As a result, it fostered a sense of dependence among the cadres. For example, during the early rice crop, when they encountered drought, the Xiaobei River flowed through here, and it was entirely possible to use manpower to carry water to fight the drought. However, the cadres of this brigade said: "Without a water pump, we can't fight the drought." They did not take action and only waited for the commune to send a water pump. The stationed cadres and commune leaders did not seize these active thoughts to conduct political and ideological education, but instead transferred a water pump, paid for the diesel fuel, and even delivered the wood for building the pump shed. As a result, the cadres and commune members' sense of dependence became more serious, and they relied solely on the water pump, canceling the method of manual water carrying. As a result, more than 250 mu of rice fields in the entire brigade suffered reduced yields because the water pump could not irrigate them. After the first discussion on the relationship between politics and production last autumn, the Commune Party Committee studied Chairman Mao's writings with this issue in mind, summarized experiences and lessons, and realized that leading production must highlight politics and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members. When this brigade needed to irrigate the late rice crop, the commune leaders no longer supplied whatever was lacking or gave whatever was needed, as they had done in the past. Instead, they mobilized the cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's writings, talk about the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, and strengthen the revolutionary spirit of the cadres and commune members. In this way, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle was promoted. Poor peasant commune member Hu Mei said: "We have hundreds of commune members, hundreds of hands, and hundreds of shoulders. We can irrigate the water even without a water pump!" Later, the commune members worked early and late to carry water and scoop water to irrigate the fields. As a result, the entire brigade increased production by more than 24,000 jin.

    By comparing the changes in the early and late rice crops of the Wu'ai Brigade, Comrade Huang Hai said with deep emotion: "In the past, my understanding of the importance of highlighting politics was relatively abstract. Now, after practice, with the living example of the Wu'ai Brigade, I deeply realize that only by highlighting politics and arming the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought can production truly be done well."

    The masses study Chairman Mao's writings, and the revolutionary spirit is greatly boosted.
    Practice proves that production cannot be done well without relying on politics.
    Li Ruichi, the party branch secretary of Huangchi Brigade, also talked about new experiences. During the last discussion, he once asserted: "Politics cannot fill the stomach. If you have enough to eat, you can even get a stone mill up a mountain." At that time, although he could not figure out the issue of highlighting politics, he felt that it was "the trend of the times," so he adopted a "wait and see" attitude. After returning, he organized the commune members to study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Once the masses studied, their revolutionary spirit was greatly boosted, and a vibrant scene appeared everywhere. Seeing this scene, the seventy-year-old poor peasant Li Qian said excitedly to him: "Ruichi, if you had led our commune members to read Chairman Mao's books earlier, the poor face of Huangchi would have changed even faster!" After hearing what the old poor peasant said, he did not sleep well all night. The next day, he and several branch committee members discussed it and felt that the brigade's increase in production in recent years was not large, and although there were many reasons, the fundamental one was the failure to highlight politics. He said: "Although politics cannot directly fill the stomach, production cannot be done well without relying on politics."

    He also talked about such a thing: When they called for winter planting of green manure last year, some cadres initially had the idea of relying solely on chemical fertilizers for production. They emphasized that there was no habit of planting green manure locally, were afraid of difficulties, and were unwilling to plant more. The party branch organized everyone to study the article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Everyone said: Solving fertilizer problems through self-reliance, reducing production costs, and increasing the income of commune members is the most realistic and important issue of caring about the well-being of the masses. No matter how great the difficulties, we must overcome them. They said what they did, and everyone went down to the production teams overnight and studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with the commune members, and spoke about the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, and mobilized the commune members to plant more green manure. Once the revolutionary spirit was promoted, the commune members were enthusiastic, and the entire brigade planted more than 1,160 mu of green manure in one go, more than six times the amount of green manure planted in the winter of the previous year.

    Backward teams are backward primarily because their political work is backward.
    Putting politics in command will have immediate results.
    During the last discussion, there was also such an opinion: Advanced teams have a high level of mass consciousness and can highlight politics; backward teams have a low level of mass consciousness, and talking about politics will not be listened to. Now, this opinion is also untenable.

    Cheng Shiyang, Deputy Secretary of the Dali Brigade Party Branch, used his brigade as an example to illustrate that what the backward team lacks is not the masses, but that the cadres have not done a good job in political work; if political work is truly done well, it will surely have immediate results. The natural conditions of the Dali Brigade are the worst in the entire commune. In recent years, the production face of this brigade has not changed much, the relationship between cadres and the masses is not harmonious, and the masses' production mood is low. At the beginning of last year, when other brigades were bustling with activity in preparing for farming, this brigade was deserted, and many people lost confidence in doing a good job in production. After the Spring Festival, with the help of a Commune Party Committee member, the Brigade Party Branch organized everyone to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "Combat Liberalism," focusing on the ideological situation of cadres and masses at that time. Through study, the ideological awareness of cadres and masses was improved. The cadres realized that they had not led production well in the past, and that the commune members had opinions, but they not only did not humbly examine themselves, but also did not want to be cadres. This was a manifestation of a lack of the spirit of serving the people. The commune members realized that they had not actively done a good job in production in the past, and that it was not conducive to unity and production to have opinions about the cadres but not raise them in person and talk nonsense behind their backs. This was a manifestation of liberalism. From then on, the cadres consciously corrected their mistakes, the commune members supported the cadres, and a warm atmosphere of unity in production appeared in the entire brigade. They stormed the place for five or six days and prepared more than 1,000 mu of rice fields. When there was a shortage of fertilizer, everyone actively sold household fertilizer and accumulated soil and miscellaneous fertilizer. Many cadres and commune members took the initiative to invest their savings in the team in order to help the team solve the problem of insufficient production funds.

    Through the second discussion, many cadres of Shuikou Commune have a new understanding of highlighting politics, and the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's writings has been improved. They have all arranged study time and stipulated that they must study at every meeting and study before discussing problems. The Commune Party Committee also appointed the Commune Cadres and the Brigade Party Branch Secretaries as the core to establish a political work organization responsible for tutoring and helping production team cadres and commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way.
