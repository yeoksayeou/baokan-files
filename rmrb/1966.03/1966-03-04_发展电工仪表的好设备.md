    Good Equipment for Developing Electrical Measuring Instruments
    Shenyang has produced a highly stable DC regulated power supply, solving the problem of high power supply costs and unstable performance in many relatively precise electrical measurement tasks.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – Shenyang has developed a highly stable DC regulated power supply, providing relatively good equipment for the development of electrical measuring instruments in China.

    This DC regulated power supply is mainly used by electrical measurement and scientific research departments to calibrate high-precision electrical measuring instruments. It can convert AC electricity into DC electricity and stabilize voltage and current fluctuations.

    Currently, in many relatively precise electrical measurement tasks in China, dry batteries or storage battery packs are still used as power sources, which are not only costly, inconvenient to use, and difficult to maintain, but also have unstable performance when discharging at higher currents. The successful trial production of the new DC regulated power supply has solved this problem.

    This DC regulated power supply was made by the Shenyang Electronic Testing Instrument Production Cooperative. This cooperative only transitioned from the saw-making industry to producing electronic testing instruments last year. The entire cooperative had no technicians, only two of the sixty-seven workers had experience with radio, and the equipment was very simple. However, they displayed the hard-bone spirit of the Chinese working class, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally produced this product. After appraisal by the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Measurement and long-term testing, it was determined that this product has good performance and is now in mass production.

    发展电工仪表的好设备
    沈阳制成稳定度很高的直流稳压电源，解决了许多比较精密的电工计量工作中电源成本高，稳定性能满足不了要求的问题
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳制成了一种稳定度很高的直流稳压电源，为我国发展电工仪表提供了一种比较好的设备。
    这种直流稳压电源主要是供电工计量和科学研究部门鉴定高精度电工仪表用的。它能使交流电变成直流电，并且使电压、电流的波动非常稳定。
    目前，我国在许多比较精密的电工计量工作中，仍然采用干电池或蓄电池组作为电源，不仅成本高，使用不便，维护困难，而且在放电流较大的情况下，它的稳定性能还满足不了要求。新的直流稳压电源的试制成功，解决了这个问题。
    制成这种直流稳压电源的是沈阳市电子测试仪器生产合作社。这个合作社是去年才从制锯行业转过来生产电子测试仪器的。全社没有技术员，六十七名工人中只有两人搞过无线电，设备也十分简陋。但是他们发扬中国工人阶级的硬骨头精神，克服了重重困难，终于制成了这种产品。经过辽宁省计量局鉴定和长时间考用，认为这种产品性能好，现已进行大批生产。
