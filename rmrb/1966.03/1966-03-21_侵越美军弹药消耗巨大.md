　　US Military Ammunition Consumption in Vietnam War is Enormous

　　The US Assistant Secretary of Defense recently stated at a gathering of American business and industrial figures that the US war of aggression against Vietnam consumes ammunition worth $210 million per month, and the US aggressor troops currently in South Vietnam receive twice the number of bombs per month as they did during the Korean War.

　　The American magazine *Newsweek*, published on March 14, provided the following statistics on the ammunition consumption of US aggressor troops in South Vietnam in 1965:

　　步枪和机枪子弹　Ten Billion rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition
　　飞机机关枪子弹　Eighty-nine Million rounds of aircraft machine gun ammunition
　　从直升飞机上投掷的手榴弹　Seven Million grenades dropped from helicopters
　　地面作战使用的手榴弹　Ten Million grenades used in ground combat
　　迫击炮炮弹　Ten Million mortar shells
　　飞机投掷的炸弹　Two Million bombs dropped from aircraft
　　火箭　Five Million rockets

　　B-52 bombers based in Guam flew about 200 bombing missions, costing $500 million (including the value of the bombs).

　　*Newsweek* stated that it has been calculated that for every South Vietnamese person killed, the US aggressors need to spend $375,000.

　　It can be imagined that the number of South Vietnamese people killed by the US and the figures for its consumption are clearly greatly reduced.

　　Due to the huge consumption of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the US Congress recently approved an additional $4.8 billion in military spending for the war of aggression against Vietnam for the purchase of weapons.

　　According to official materials quoted in a recent issue of *U.S. News & World Report*, the US military is expected to issue orders worth a total of $20 billion in the first half of this year for the procurement, research, and development of new weapons, about 70 percent more than in the first half of last year. Among them, the total expenditure for the purchase of aircraft, guns, artillery shells, bombs, trucks and other military equipment is worth about $14.6 billion, almost double the same period last year.

　　However, despite the fact that US imperialism is placing increasingly larger bets in this war of aggression, it cannot save the inevitable defeat. The increasing number of casualties suffered by the US military in Vietnam in South Vietnam is the most powerful proof.

### 侵越美军弹药消耗巨大

    侵越美军弹药消耗巨大
    美国助理国防部长最近在一次美国企业界、工业界人士集会上说，美国侵越战争每月消耗弹药价值达两亿一千万美元，目前在南越的美国侵略军每月得到的炸弹相当于侵朝战争期间的两倍。
    三月十四日出版的美国《新闻周刊》对一九六五年美国侵略军在南越的弹药消耗作了如下的统计：
  步枪和机枪子弹　十亿发
  飞机机关枪子弹　八千九百万发
  从直升飞机上投掷的手榴弹　七百万颗
  地面作战使用的手榴弹　一千万颗
  迫击炮炮弹　一千万发
  飞机投掷的炸弹　两百万颗
  火箭　五百万支
    以关岛为基地的B—52型轰炸机出动轰炸约二百次，耗费（包括炸弹价值）五亿美元。
    《新闻周刊》说，有人统计每屠杀一名越南南方人民，美国侵略者就需要耗费三十七万五千美元。
    可以想到，美国屠杀南越人民的数目和它的消耗的数字，显然是大大地缩小了。
    由于侵越战争消耗巨大，美国国会最近又批准追加四十八亿美元侵越军费，作为采购武器之用。
    据最近一期《美国新闻与世界报道》引用官方公布的材料说，今年上半年内，美国军方在采购、研究和发展新式武器等方面，预计将发出总值二百亿美元的订单，比去年上半年多百分之七十左右。其中，用于采购飞机、枪炮、炮弹、炸弹、卡车及其他军用器材的开支总和约值一百四十六亿美元，几乎比去年同期增加一倍。
    但是，尽管美帝国主义在这场侵略战争中投下越来越大的赌注，却挽救不了既定的败局。侵越美军在南越遭到越来越多的伤亡，就是最有力的证明。
