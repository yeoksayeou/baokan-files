Title: Using One to Drive a Hundred, Always Taking the Initiative

    In recent years, I've had this experience: To grasp production, you must first grasp politics, which is the fundamental. By emphasizing politics, we won't resort to "treating the head when the head hurts, and treating the foot when the foot hurts." We can solve problems from the root, using one to drive a hundred, and always taking the initiative.

    Take the issue of water release, for example. In the old society, there was a saying: "When it comes to tea and wine, nobody cares where the money comes from. But when it comes to water release, even fathers and sons won't yield to each other." After liberation, things improved a lot, but disputes over water release still occurred frequently. Last June, because it hadn't rained heavily for two consecutive months, the fields were severely dry. Even for digging one hoe-stroke earlier or releasing one second of water earlier, the production teams would fight over it. How could this problem be solved? We thought: Should we first organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, raise awareness, enhance the overall perspective, and overcome the selfish departmentalism? Although we weren't very confident in this method, we still squeezed out half a day to organize the cadres of each team to study the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In the discussion, some said that compared with Comrade Bethune's communist spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, we were indeed far behind. Others said that if we all fight for water, you take a little, he takes a little, we still can't solve the problem of water shortage. After the study, everyone raised their awareness, and disputes over water release never happened again. On the evening of the second day after the discussion, Zou Changyou, the captain of the Sixth Production Team, even took the initiative to organize members of his team to deliver water to the eighth and ninth teams downstream. The commune members happily reflected: "In the past, when it came to water release, even tying up a tiger couldn't guard it. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's works, people automatically send the water down."

    Through this event, I received a great education. In the past, I was busy dealing with water disputes, and couldn't finish dealing with them every day. By emphasizing politics, the problem was solved in half a day. It seems that to continuously develop production, we must always emphasize politics.
      Zou Minghan, Captain of the First Brigade, Yunxi Commune, Shifang County, Sichuan Province

    Editor's note: Whether emphasizing politics is effective or not, Comrade Zou Minghan originally had doubts. However, the facts educated him: If leading production doesn't emphasize politics, it can only be "treating the head when the head hurts, and treating the foot when the foot hurts," and being passive everywhere. By emphasizing politics, problems can be solved from the root, even water disputes that in the old society fathers and sons wouldn't yield to each other, were smoothly resolved. Comrade Zou Minghan's experience is a good medicine for those who don't believe in the power of politics.

### 以一带百处处主动

    以一带百处处主动
    几年来，我有这样的体会：抓生产，先要抓政治，这才是抓到了根本。突出了政治，就不会“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”，就能从根本上解决问题，以一带百，处处主动。
    就拿放水这件事情来说，旧社会有一个说法：
  “吃茶喝酒，谁给钱都没有来头。要放水，就是父子都不得相让。”解放后，情况好多了，可是为放水闹意见的事还是经常发生。去年六月间，因为连续两个月没有下大雨，田里旱得很凶。各个生产队之间，就连早挖一锄头、早放一秒钟的水，都要争一下。怎样解决这个问题呢？我们想：是不是先组织大家学习毛主席著作，提高认识，增强全局观点，克服各顾各的本位主义思想。对这个办法，我们信心虽然并不很足，但还是挤了半天时间，组织各个队的干部学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章。在讨论中，有的说，和白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人的共产主义精神一比，确实相差太远了。有的说，我们大家争着放水，争了半天，你放一点，他放一点，还是解决不了缺水的问题。学习以后，大家提高了觉悟，为放水闹意见的事情，再也没有发生。在讨论后的第二天晚上，第六生产队队长邹长友，还主动组织本队社员把水送到下游的八、九队去。社员们高兴地反映说：“过去放水，就是拴个老虎也守不住。现在学了毛主席著作，人家自动地就把水送下来了。”
    通过这件事，我受到了很大的教育。过去忙着处理争水问题，天天处理不完；突出了政治，半天时间就把问题解决了。看来要不断发展生产，就要永远突出政治。
      四川省什邡县云西公社一大队队长　邹明汉
    编者按：突出政治管不管用，邹明汉同志原来也是怀疑的。可是，事实教育了他：领导生产如果不突出政治，就只能是“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”，处处被动；突出了政治，就能从根本上解决问题，甚至象水利纠纷这种在旧社会父子不相让的问题，也顺利地解决了。邹明汉同志的体会，对于那些不相信政治威力的人，是一剂良药。
