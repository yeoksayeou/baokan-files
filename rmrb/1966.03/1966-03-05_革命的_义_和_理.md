    In a train car from Guangzhou to Foshan, a debate unfolded among the passengers. The main question debated was: Is being a cadre "ek dat" or not?
    “Ek dat” in Cantonese means “to suffer a loss” or "take a hit". Is being a cadre really "ek dat"? From different perspectives, one will arrive at different answers. If starting from the small "self," being a cadre means worrying and expending effort, "spending energy and time," and even "suffering grievances" if things don't go well, so of course it's "ek dat." Female production team leader Comrade Zuo Feng didn't see it that way. She believed: "'Ek dat'? We have to think about what our 'dat' is like," think about the past, compare it to the present, "what have we 'ek'ed'?" Furthermore, "For the revolution, for the people, what does it matter if we earn a few fewer work points!" In this debate, she was truly righteous in word and stern in tone, and justified in reason and full of confidence. This "righteousness" is the righteousness of the revolution; this "reason" is the reason of the revolution. Precisely because she holds the revolutionary "righteousness" and "reason" in her heart, she is "stern in word" and "full of confidence."
      "We have to think about what our 'dat' is like," this question is extremely well-posed! Before liberation, what was the "dat" of us poor and lower-middle peasants? It was the "dat" of being beasts of burden for the landlords, the "dat" of not having enough to eat or wear! Why did we have such a "dat"? Because the official seal was in the hands of the reactionaries. Back then, could we poor and lower-middle peasants be any kind of "cadre"? Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we ourselves have grasped the official seal and improved our lives, yet we are afraid of "ek dat" and unwilling to be cadres? Mu Guiying in *Mu Guiying Takes Command* said, "If I don't take command, who will?" Today, in the countryside, we poor and lower-middle peasants must have this spirit of "If I don't take command, who will?" and firmly grasp the official seal! If everyone is afraid of "spending energy and time," afraid of "ek dat," and unwilling to be cadres, are we supposed to give the official seal to landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements?
      "For the revolution, for the people, what does it matter if we earn a few fewer work points!" These words explain the principle at a deeper level. In fact, as a production team cadre, as long as you earnestly participate in collective labor, you won't earn fewer work points. These words reflect the consciousness and style of a revolutionary cadre. Being a cadre means being a servant of the people, contributing to the revolution. For the people, for the revolution, there is fundamentally no question of "ek dat." Comrade Zuo Feng said it well: "I want revolution," "What am I afraid of if it's a bit hard?" For the people, for the revolution, "spending time and energy" is our revolutionary cadres' responsibility and our revolutionary cadres' glory.
    A woman who is illiterate, in this debate, has such a firm stance and such clear viewpoints, and the key lies in her earnest study of Chairman Mao's writings and arming her mind with Mao Zedong Thought.

### 革命的“义”和“理”

    革命的“义”和“理”
    薛步
    在一节从广州开往佛山的火车车厢里，乘客之间展开了一场辩论。辩论的主要问题是：当干部“蚀底”不“蚀底”？
    广东话的“蚀底”，就是“吃亏”的意思。当干部究竟“蚀底”不“蚀底”呢？从不同的角度出发，就会作出不同的回答。如果从小“我”出发，当干部操心费力，“花精神，花时间”，弄得不好还要“受气”，当然是“蚀底”的。女生产队长左凤同志不是这么看问题的。她认为：“‘蚀底’？可要想想我们的‘底’是怎样的呀”，想想过去，比比现在，“我们‘蚀’了什么？”再说，“为革命，为人民，就算少赚几个工分，又算得什么！”她在这场辩论中，真是义正词严，理直气壮。这个“义”，就是革命的“义”；这个“理”，就是革命的“理”。正因为她心中装着的是革命的“义”和“理”，所以，她就“词严”，“气壮”。
      “可要想想我们的‘底’”，这个问题提得好极了！解放前，我们贫下中农是什么“底”？是给地主当牛作马的“底”，是没吃少穿的“底”！为什么会有这样的“底”？因为印把子掌握在反动派手里。那时候，我们贫下中农能当什么“干部”吗？如今，我们在共产党领导下，自己掌握了印把子，又改善了生活，反倒怕“蚀底”，不愿当干部了？《穆桂英挂帅》里的穆桂英说过“我不挂帅谁挂帅”的话。今天，在农村里，我们贫下中农就要有这种“我不挂帅谁挂帅”的气概，牢牢地掌握好印把子！如果大家都怕“花精神，花时间”，怕“蚀底”，不愿当干部，难道把印把子去让给地富反坏吗？
      “为革命，为人民，就算少赚几个工分，又算得什么！”这话把道理又说深了一层。事实上，作为一个生产队的干部，只要你认真参加集体劳动，也不会少挣工分的。她的这番话，反映了一个革命干部的觉悟和风格。当干部，就是做人民的勤务员，为革命出力。为人民，为革命，就根本不存在“蚀底”的问题。左凤同志说得好：“我要革命”，“辛苦点怕什么”。为人民，为革命，“花时间，花精神”，这是我们革命干部的责任，也是我们革命干部的光荣。
    一个不识字的妇女，在这场辩论中，立场如此坚定，观点如此鲜明，关键就在于她认真地学习了毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑。
