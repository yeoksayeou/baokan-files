    Master Niu and Foreman Lu
    Qiqihar Railway Bureau　Qin You
    Master Niu's name is Niu Chengdong, and he is the leader of the connecting rod group in the Yitulihe Locomotive Depot factory. Recently, he has been paying special attention to repairing trains to a high standard.
    Those who know the inside story understand that this is inseparable from Foreman Lu Zhanshan changing his work style and doing a good job in ideological work.
    One day, a locomotive entered the factory for washing and inspection. After washing and inspection, the knocking sound was very loud. Foreman Lu Zhanshan's fiery temper flared up, and he said, "Repair everything according to standards, and I don't believe the knocking sound can't be eliminated!"
    Master Niu shook his head when he heard this: "It's easy for cadres to just talk, but it's difficult to do the work!"
    Lu Zhanshan heard this and thought about it: he felt that his partner was unwilling to adhere to high standards because of his own tendency to be bossy!
    A few days later, it just so happened that there was no washing and inspection task, so Lu Zhanshan said to Master Niu, "Let's go out with the train today and take a look!" So, they took their inspection hammers and got on the train.
    As soon as the train left Yitulihe Station, it charged into the Hada Ridge. The long slope with a gradient of 26 per thousand made traction very difficult. At this time, the driver had already pulled the steam valve to the maximum, and the exhaust sound shook the valley. Master Niu leaned his upper body out to listen to the locomotive's movement. Based on his many years of experience, he could hear that the banging exhaust sound was mixed with a clanging knocking sound, and the car body was vibrating violently. He couldn't help but nod and whispered, "It needs to be repaired properly when we get back."
    Lu Zhanshan saw all of this. On the way back, they followed two more trains, and they specifically chose a train that had just been washed and inspected, but the knocking sound was still very loud because of the poor repair quality. Master Niu said excitedly, "The crew members can handle such high ridges, and the trains we repair should also be able to handle them!"
    Since returning from this trip, Master Niu's temper has changed. He no longer complained about having too much work, and he even actively sought out work.

    牛师傅和鲁工长
    齐齐哈尔铁路局　秦邮
    牛师傅叫牛成栋，是伊图里河机务段工厂连杆组长。近来，他特别注意高标准修车。
    知道底细的人明白：这和工长鲁占山改变作风做好思想工作分不开的。
    一天，一辆机车进厂洗检。洗检后，打音很重，工长鲁占山的火炮性子就发作了，他说：“处处按标准修，就不信打音消灭不了！”
    牛师傅一听就摇头：“干部上下嘴唇一碰，就妥了，说话容易干活难哪！”
    鲁占山听在耳里，想在心中：觉得伙伴不愿坚持高标准是和自己好指手划脚的作风有关系呀！
    过了几天，正巧没有洗检任务，鲁占山对牛师傅说：“今天咱俩跟车出去看看吧！”于是，他们提了检点锤就上了车。
    列车一出伊图里河车站，就闯哈达岭。千分之二十六的长大坡道，牵引十分困难。这时，司机早已把汽门拉到头，排汽声震动着山谷。牛师傅将上半身探出去，听听机车走行的动静，凭着多年的经验，听出在嘭嘭的排汽声中，夹杂着叮当作响的打音声，车身震动得很厉害。他不由地点点头，低声说：“回去得好好修啊。”
    这一切，鲁占山都看在眼里。在往回返的时候，他们又跟了两趟车，还特地选了一台刚洗检出厂的车，同样因为修车质量不高，打音很重。牛师傅激动地说：“闯这样高的大岭，乘务员是过得硬的，咱们修的车也该过得硬啊！”
    从这次跟车回来，牛师傅脾气就变了。活再多也不嫌麻烦，还主动找活干哩。
