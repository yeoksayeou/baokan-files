    According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa: A people's police force in Lhasa, Tibet, composed of the sons and daughters of emancipated serfs and slaves, under the cultivation and education of the Party, serves the people everywhere and in everything, and is deeply loved by the masses.
    From this year's Spring Festival to the Tibetan New Year (February 21), the Lhasa people's police launched a "Love the People Month" campaign, doing great good for the people. Tibetan policemen enthusiastically helped the masses carry water, sweep the floor, repair wells, and improve environmental sanitation. Some gave haircuts and washed clothes for the masses, helped patients register for medical treatment, and guided farmers and herdsmen from the countryside. These policemen also regularly help elderly people living alone, the chronically ill, and poor residents with little labor. Policeman Basang, a slave in the old society, loves the working masses very much after becoming a policeman. He helps old Ama Luosang Quzhen carry water, sweep the floor, buy oil, and buy grain. Luosang Quzhen said, "Basang is even closer than my own son. I miss him in my heart if I don't see him for three days."
    On the eve of the Tibetan New Year, at a police-people forum in Lhasa, resident Luosang said that in the old society, reactionary policemen with fierce faces and long sticks came out every morning to make trouble for the common people. Compared with the old police, the people's police after liberation are truly as different as heaven and earth. Every year during the rainy season, the people's police come to my house to check whether the house is leaking and whether the walls are strong. At the forum, many residents said that this is because of the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    处处为人民　事事为人民
    拉萨民警深受群众爱戴
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏拉萨一支由翻身农奴和奴隶的子女组成的人民警察，在党的培养教育下，处处为人民、事事为人民，深受群众的爱戴。
    今年春节到藏历年（二月二十一日）前，拉萨的人民警察开展了爱民月运动，为人民大办好事。藏族民警热情帮助群众背水、扫地、整修水井、改善环境卫生，有的为群众理发洗衣，帮助病人挂号，为乡下来的农牧民带路。这些民警在平时还经常帮助孤寡老人、长期病人和劳动力少的贫苦居民做事。民警巴桑，在旧社会是个奴隶，当了民警后非常热爱劳动群众。他帮助老阿妈洛桑曲珍背水扫地，买油买粮。洛桑曲珍说：“巴桑比我的亲儿子还亲，三天不见，我心里就想念他。”
    藏历年前夕，在拉萨的一次警民座谈会上，居民洛桑说，在旧社会，满脸横肉的反动警察，每天清早手拿长棍，出来找老百姓的麻烦。解放后的人民警察和旧警察相比，真是天上地下。每年雨季，人民警察到我家察看房屋是否漏雨，墙壁是否坚固。座谈会上，很多居民都说，这是共产党毛主席领导得好。
