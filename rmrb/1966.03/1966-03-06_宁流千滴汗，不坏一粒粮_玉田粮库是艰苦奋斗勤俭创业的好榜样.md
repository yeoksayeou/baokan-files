    "Rather Sweat a Thousand Drops Than Spoil a Grain of Rice"
    Yutian Grain Depot is a Good Example of Hard Work and Frugal Entrepreneurship
    For twelve years, they have persisted in the "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" struggle, maintaining and promoting the proletarian style of hard work. Relying on their own wisdom and hands, the grain depot workers thoroughly improved the storage conditions, achieved "four-without" warehouses, and greatly reduced the natural loss of grain and storage costs.
    Our newspaper, Tianjin, 5th - The workers of Yutian Grain Depot in Hebei Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have worked hard for twelve years to transform a dilapidated old house into a "four-without" grain depot, famous throughout the country for being free of insects, mold, sparrows and mice, and accidents, becoming a red banner in the national grain work system.
    Yutian Grain Depot was established in 1949. It is responsible for receiving, storing, and transporting grain and oil sold to the state by more than 430 production teams from six nearby communes. From 1955 to 1965, it stored and managed more than 200 million jin of grain and oil for the country. The average annual natural loss per thousand jin of grain was six liang and eight qian in the early days of the depot, but now it is only one liang and nine qian; the storage cost per ten thousand jin of grain has also been reduced from 55 yuan in the past to 7 yuan and 6 fen.
    When talking about how they achieved these achievements, Zhang Ru, the director of the grain depot, told reporters: "The twelve years we have gone through are the twelve years of struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies, the twelve years of Mao Zedong Thought taking root in the grain depot."
    In 1954, the Ministry of Food promoted the experience of Yu Hang, Zhejiang, in creating insect-free granaries through self-reliance, pointing out a way for them to improve storage conditions. However, at that time, some people were still looking to the state, hoping that the state would provide funds to tear down the dilapidated houses and build new warehouses. Most of the workers disagreed with this view. They said: "The country is under construction and funds are needed everywhere. We can't just reach out to the state for money!" The Party branch supported the opinion of the majority and put forward the slogan "Rather sweat a thousand drops than spoil a grain of rice", guiding the workers to embark on the road of self-reliance, hard work and frugal entrepreneurship.
    In the process of continuously improving storage conditions over the past twelve years, the grain depot workers have put in arduous labor and experienced many ideological struggles. When they first started renovating the warehouses in 1954, some people said: "The tadpoles in the well, the maggots in the soy sauce, and the insects in the grain are born naturally and can't be completely eliminated." Others said: "The experience of Yu Hang is good, but our depot's conditions are poor and we can't learn from it." The Party branch conducted repeated education and mobilization, criticizing conservative and fearful thinking. Jin Ming, the Party branch secretary at the time, took the lead, peeling off the mud from the walls, digging out the cracks in the walls, and excavating the source of insects, which motivated all the workers in the depot. They suspended ceilings and plastered walls. Since they didn't have any experience at first, they hired a few technicians to experiment in two warehouses first. The workers learned and worked at the same time. Some people's hands were burned by lime, but they didn't complain. After more than a year of hard work, the beams and pillars of the seventy-two warehouses were generally trimmed and cleaned, all the walls were plastered with a fresh coat, and ceilings were suspended in all the warehouses, which were snow-white, flat, and clean.
    At this time, some people said: "We've finally made it through this time." The Party branch promptly seized this ideological trend and organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's thought on continuous revolution. "We've changed 'heaven', but we haven't changed 'earth' yet!" Everyone then focused their attention on transforming the warehouse floor. How to transform the warehouse floor? Some people suggested: "If you want the warehouse floor not to be damp and not be stolen by mice, unless you make a cement floor, any other method is like a blind man lighting a lamp - a waste of effort." However, according to calculations, the cement floor of more than seventy warehouses would require more than ten tons of cement. Most of the workers were reluctant to spend this money. At this time, the experience of a grain depot in Shandong Province in transforming the warehouse floor by using the "laying sand and brick" method was passed on here. At that time, some workers didn't quite believe this experience and were afraid of "wasting manpower and money." Zhang Ru, the director of the grain depot, and several old workers, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that everything should be tested through experiments, first conducted experiments in the two most humid warehouses. They laid a foot-thick layer of hot sand on the warehouse floor and then laid a layer of adobe bricks on top of it. After a year, when they dug open the warehouse floor, it was only half an inch wet. Mice had also disappeared. Just as they were preparing to widely promote this experience, someone proposed: "The amount of work involved in laying sand and bricks is too large, let's hire people to do it. Hiring people to lay the warehouse floor is cheaper than buying sorghum stalks and reed mats!" However, the old workers did not agree. They said: "If we spend money everywhere, isn't that buying 'four-without'? What revolution are we still going to make!" From that time on, every spring, they made adobe bricks; in the summer, they dug sand from the moat, and then exposed the sand to the scorching sun until it reached forty degrees, and then laid it in the warehouse while it was hot. In this way, starting in 1957, the workers worked hard for three springs and summers, moving more than 600 cubic meters of sand and stone and making more than 20,000 adobe bricks, and finally transformed all the warehouses into "iron-bottom warehouses" with sand and brick floors.
    During this period, after studying Chairman Mao's note added to the article "Running Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally" and the section on thrift in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the workers strengthened their thinking on hard work and frugality. At the same time, the renovation of the warehouses saved the workers a lot of heavy labor. For example, in the past, when the warehouse floor was paved with stone blocks and reed mats, every year during the cleaning and disinfection (brushing lime to kill insect eggs), it had to be moved in and out, exposed to the sun, and knocked, which was very heavy labor. After laying sand and bricks, it could be used for more than ten years at a time, saving a lot of labor. The workers said: "We liberated ourselves through labor." In this way, the workers' enthusiasm for improving storage conditions on their own was further enhanced.
    From 1954 to 1965, in the course of twelve years, the grain depot's less than twenty workers independently organized three "battles" and completed eight projects. They renovated seventy-two warehouses, built fifty open-air pile bottoms, laid more than 900 square meters of cinder floor, built more than 150 meters of enclosing walls, and built two underground fire-fighting pools, saving the country a lot of investment.
    Yutian Grain Depot workers are not only willing to work hard, but also good at working cleverly. In order to save expenses for the country, many people have painstakingly studied carpentry, ironwork, and other technologies, and have self-made and repaired tools and equipment. They have already self-made more than 1,000 pieces of storage machinery and testing instruments. The four conveyors they manufactured themselves alone have saved the country more than 10,000 yuan in funds. The warehouse floor sampling device, bamboo tube thermometer, etc., which they created, are new creations in grain storage work, but the cost is very cheap.
    In the autumn of 1965, the Yutian County Grain Bureau asked the grain depot to buy an electric thermostatic incubator to help the production team do seed germination tests in winter. When the workers heard that it would cost more than 800 yuan to buy one, they decided to make it themselves. The custodians Wu Ruihua and Wang Lianzhong, after eighteen experiments, made a seed incubator with automatic control for only a dozen yuan. Recently, they have also used indigenous methods to make more precise testing instruments such as protein digestion distillers and fat extractors, solving the problem of testing the nutritional content of grain.
    Yutian Grain Depot workers are extremely responsible for state property, meticulously adhere to the grain depot's various inspection, testing, cleaning, hygiene, equipment disinfection and storage systems, regardless of how tight the work is, regardless of wind, rain, or festivals, they have never relaxed. In order to gain experience in high-temperature airtight sterilization to eliminate wheat pests, the grain depot used 150,000 jin of wheat for experiments starting in 1955. The workers measured the temperature every three hours and tested the moisture content every seven days, persisting for three years without a single interruption. In this way, in the course of twelve years, they have researched 30 different storage methods for wheat, corn, potatoes and other crops.
    The spirit of diligence and thrift has taken root in the hearts of the people of this grain depot and has spread to all aspects. If anyone sees a grain of rice or a piece of broken rope in the yard, they pick it up right away. Even using a broken bamboo broom handle to burn for fire feels like a pity. The workers picked them up one by one and stacked them in the equipment room. In 1963, it was used to replace reed mats to cover several houses. Half of the filing cabinets and tables used in the offices and laboratories were made by the workers using old wood and adobe bricks. Even "chicken feathers and garlic peels" have become useful things here. When the canteen slaughters a chicken during the New Year, they save the chicken feathers and make feather dusters. Broken burlap bags and rotten hemp rope ends are picked up and chopped into hemp knives for plastering walls and building houses.... At the beginning, some people thought it was "stingy" for the old workers to do this. Now, the common saying is: "I feel heartache when I hear about spending the state's money. I feel unwilling to see a little bit of the state's things being wasted."
    Not long ago, the Ministry of Food held a flag-awarding conference in Tangshan City, awarding the Yutian Grain Depot a banner embroidered with the words "Carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and forever advance on the road of hard work and frugal entrepreneurship", and called on grain workers across the country to learn from this advanced unit in the national grain work.

    “宁流千滴汗，不坏一粒粮”
    玉田粮库是艰苦奋斗勤俭创业的好榜样
    他们坚持“兴无灭资”斗争十二年，保持和发扬无产阶级艰苦奋斗的作风。粮库职工凭自己的智慧和双手，彻底改善了仓储条件，实现了仓库“四无”，大大降低了粮食的自然损耗和保管费用。
    本报天津五日电　河北省玉田粮库职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，艰苦奋斗十二年，把一座破破烂烂的旧宅院改造成了全国闻名的无虫、无霉烂、无雀鼠、无事故的“四无”粮库，成为全国粮食工作系统的一面红旗。
    玉田粮库是在一九四九年建立的。它负责接收、保管和调运附近六个公社四百三十多个生产队向国家交售的粮食和油料。从一九五五年到一九六五年，它为国家储存保管了二亿多斤粮食和油料。平均每一千斤粮食一年的自然损耗，建库初期为六斤八两，现在只有一两九钱；每一万斤粮食的保管费用，也由过去的五十五元降低到七元零六分。
    粮库主任张儒在谈到他们如何取得这些成就的时候，对记者说：“我们走过的十二年，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想打架的十二年，是毛主席思想在粮库中扎根的十二年。”
    一九五四年，粮食部推广了浙江余杭自己动手创造无虫粮仓的经验，为他们指出了改善仓储条件的门路。可是，当时还是有人眼睛望着国家，希望国家出钱，把破烂房屋拆掉，另盖新仓房。大多数职工不同意这种意见。他们说：“国家正在建设，到处需要资金。我们不能动不动就伸手向国家要钱！”党支部支持大多数人的意见，并且提出了“宁流千滴汗，不坏一粒粮”的口号，引导职工走上自己动手、勤俭创业的道路。
    在十二年来不断改善仓储条件的过程中，粮库职工付出了艰巨的劳动，也经历过多次思想斗争。一九五四年刚开始改造仓房的时候，有人说：“井里的蛤蟆，酱里的蛆，粮食里的虫子是天生的，治也治不完。”还有人说：“余杭的经验好是好，就是咱库条件差，学不了。”党支部进行了反复的教育动员，批判了保守畏难思想。当时的党支部书记靳明首先上阵，剥墙泥，掏墙缝，挖虫源，带动了全库职工。他们吊顶棚，抹墙壁，开始没有经验，就请了几名技术工人，先在两间仓房作试验。职工们边学边干。有的被石灰烧肿了手，也不叫苦。经过一年多的辛勤劳动，七十二间仓房的梁柱普遍经过剔缝刮污，所有仓壁粉刷一新，仓房都吊上了顶棚，雪白平整，干干净净。
    这时候，又有人说：“这回可熬出来了。”党支部及时抓住这个思想苗头，组织职工学习了毛主席关于不断革命的思想。“咱们改了‘天’，还没换
  ‘地’呢！”大家又把注意力集中到改造仓底方面。怎么样改造仓房地面呢？有人提出：“要想仓底不返潮，老鼠盗不动，除非是打水泥地面，别的办法都是瞎子点灯白费蜡。”可是，一计算，七十多间仓房的水泥地面，得用十多吨水泥。多数职工都舍不得花这笔钱。正在这时候，山东省粮库采用“铺沙垫坯”办法改造仓底的经验，传到了这里。当时，有的职工不大相信这一经验，害怕“劳民伤财”。粮库主任张儒和几个老职工就根据毛主席一切经过试验的教导，先在两座最潮湿的仓房里进行试验。他们把仓底铺上了一尺厚的热沙子，上面又铺上一层土坯。过了一年扒开仓底一看，只湿了半寸。老鼠也绝迹了。正准备普遍推广这一经验时，又有人提出来：“铺沙垫坯的工程量太大，雇人搞吧。请人垫仓底，比原来买秫秸、苇席还省钱呢！”但是，老职工却不答应，他们说：“要是处处花钱，那不是买‘四无’吗？还要咱革什么命！”从那时候起，每到春天，他们就脱土坯；到夏天，他们从护城河里挖沙子，然后顶着毒日头把沙子晒到四十度，趁热铺到仓房里。就这样，从一九五七年开始，职工们苦干了三个春夏，搬运了六百多立方米的沙石，脱了两万多块土坯，终于将仓房全部改造成为铺沙垫坯的“铁底仓”。
    这个期间，职工们经过学习毛主席为《勤俭办社》一文所加的按语，《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中关于节约的部分，艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的思想加强了。同时，仓房经过改造，节省了职工许多笨重劳动。例如，过去仓底砌石块、铺苇席的时候，每年清仓消毒（刷石灰杀虫卵），要搬出搬进，曝晒，敲打，是很笨重的劳动。铺沙垫坯以后，一次可以用十几年，节省了很多劳动力。职工们说：“我们是通过劳动，自己解放了自己。”这样一来，职工们自己动手改善仓储条件的积极性更加提高了。
    从一九五四年到一九六五年，十二年当中，这个粮库的不到二十名职工先后自己动手组织了三个“战役”，完成了八项工程。他们改造了七十二间仓房，修建了五十座露天囤底，铺了九百多平方米的焦渣地坪，建了一百五十多米长的围墙，还建了两个地下防火水池，为国家节省了大量投资。
    玉田粮库职工不但肯于苦干，而且善于巧干。为了给国家节省开支，不少人刻苦钻研木工、铁工等技术，自制自修工具、器材。他们已自制保管机具和化验仪器一千多件。只是自己制造的四台输送机，就为国家节省资金上万元。他们创制的仓底扦样器、竹管测温器等，都是粮食仓储工作中的新创造，成本却非常便宜。
    一九六五年秋天，玉田县粮食局让粮库买一台电热恒温箱，以便在冬季帮助生产队做种子发芽试验。职工们听说要花八百多元才能买一台，便决定自己做。保管员吴瑞华和王连仲两个人经过十八次试验，只花了十几块钱就做出了一台自动控制种子培养箱。最近，他们又用土办法制成了蛋白消解蒸流器、脂肪提取器等比较精密的化验仪器，解决了化验粮食营养成分的难题。
    玉田粮库职工们对国家财产极端负责，一丝不苟地坚持粮库的各种检查、化验、清洁卫生、器材的消毒保管等制度，不管工作多紧，不管刮风下雨或逢年过节，从来没有放松过。粮库里为了取得高温密闭消灭小麦害虫的经验，从一九五五年开始，用十五万斤小麦作了试验。职工们每隔三小时测一次温度，七天化验一次水分，一直坚持了三年，没有中断过一次。就这样，他们在十二年当中，研究出小麦、玉米、薯类等三十项不同的保管方法。
    这个粮库勤俭节约之风已深入人心，遍及各个方面。院子里丢一粒粮食、一根碎绳头，谁看到谁就随手拣起来。用坏了的竹扫帚把子，拿去烧火也觉得可惜。职工们把它一个个拣起来，码在器材房里。一九六三年，用它代替苇箔盖了好几间房子。办公室、化验室里用的文件橱、桌子，有一半是职工们用旧木料和土坯做成的。就连“鸡毛蒜皮”的东西，在这里也成了有用之物。过年过节食堂里杀只鸡，他们把鸡毛留起来，扎成鸡毛掸子。破麻袋片、烂麻绳头，他们拣起来，剁成抹墙盖房用的麻刀……。开始时，有人看到老职工这么做，认为是“小气”。现在，普遍的说法是：“一听说花国家的钱就心疼。看到糟踏国家一点东西，就觉得不忍心。”
    不久以前，粮食部在唐山市召开授旗大会，把一幅绣有“发扬不断革命精神，在艰苦奋斗、勤俭创业的道路上永远前进”字样的锦旗，授予玉田粮库，并号召全国粮食职工向这个全国粮食工作先进单位学习。
