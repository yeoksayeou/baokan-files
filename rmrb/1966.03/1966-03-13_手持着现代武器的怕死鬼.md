    Cowards with Modern Weapons
      From "Lowering Their Heads"
      To "Wailing Loudly"
    During the war of aggression against Korea, a saying was popular on the front lines of the American invading army: "Lower your heads!" More than a decade later, the American invading army has developed from "lowering their heads" to "wailing loudly." On the South Vietnamese battlefield, their soldiers cry, and their officers cry, whenever they encounter life-threatening dangers; infantrymen cry, paratroopers cry; even the American "advisors" sent to the South Vietnamese puppet army look to the sky and wail loudly.
    At the front, we visited the South Vietnamese Liberation Army units participating in the defense of the country. The tiger-fighting heroes of this unit, fresh from the battlefield, summarized the morale of the American army in three stages: first, they dare not show their heads; then, they drop their guns and run away; and finally, they wail loudly. They become frightened and disoriented at the sound of gunfire. Some soldiers, forced to charge by their officers, would run behind the tanks and wail loudly as soon as they were pushed back.
    One day, we visited a company that had fought against the US 173rd Airborne Brigade. Deputy Squad Leader Li Hongming vividly described the ugly behavior of the American soldiers on the battlefield: "When the American devils attack, they dare not disperse, let alone maneuver; they always crawl forward in groups of three or five. They are covered in sweat, panting for breath, and look ridiculously frightened. Every time we repulse an American attack, we hear crying from their positions. At first, we thought it was the sound of cows, but upon closer listening, we realized it was their crying, and everyone laughed. At this time, we would fire single shots, one shot for each one." As we were talking, a group of soldiers gathered around, and a young soldier chimed in, "At the time, we encouraged each other by saying, 'The enemy is crying because we're beating them! We must beat them harder and make them cry even louder!'" This made all the soldiers around laugh.
    Burying Their Heads in Piles of Earth
    "American officers are afraid of death, and 'advisors' are even more afraid of death," the soldiers said with disdain. "From a distance, they dare to resist with their pistols, but when we charge, they are so scared that they drop their pistols and run for their lives."
    During the battle of Ping Ye, when the Liberation Army directly penetrated the puppet army's command post, an American "advisor" who was resisting with two guns was so frightened that he dropped his revolver with one hand and threw away his submachine gun with the other, only caring about burying his head in a pile of earth and shivering. Liberation Army soldiers rushed over and told him to raise his hands in surrender. He tremblingly raised his hands and knelt down, shouting for mercy in gibberish. Because prisoners were difficult to guard in the jungle, Liberation Army soldiers had to tie them up. When a single rattan vine was not enough to restrain him, this American "advisor," pale with fright, hurriedly pointed to his pocket, indicating for the soldiers to take out the American-made nylon rope to tie him up. The soldiers greeted this ugly scene of the American prisoner with scornful laughter. One soldier sarcastically said, "The American army has a high degree of awareness!"
    "May God Bless"
    The Johnson administration had racked its brains to boost the morale of the American troops invading Vietnam. They established a war psychology research organization in Saigon to instill aggressive ideology into the American troops and their accomplice forces. They used Lincoln's poems to numb and deceive the soldiers, enabling them to die for "defending American freedom." At the same time, they adopted a series of material incentives. However, what was the response to these measures of appeasement and bribery? A letter from America written by a soldier's family wrote: "Our whole family hopes you will do everything possible to save your life, find a way to leave South Vietnam quickly, and return home to reunite with us." The American soldier's reply stated: "...This war, I don't know when it will end. Forget it, let's leave everything to fate! When in danger, we can only ask God to bless us."
    Because the United States was having difficulty finding soldiers, the Johnson administration had to repeatedly extend the terms of service for American troops invading Vietnam, which made the morale of the American troops worse and worse. At the front, we saw letters between a US Army sergeant named Io Francis, captured from his body, and his wife. His wife advised him "not to participate in sweeps, but to wait until his service period is over and return home as soon as possible." This old sergeant, already forty-two years old, wrote in his reply: "My service period was originally over, but under the compulsion of my superiors, I had to extend my service period. May God bless me to return home safely..." However, this sergeant had not finished writing this letter when he was driven to the front lines and killed in the "sweep" that his wife did not want him to participate in.
    Scarecrow-like Spinelessness
    Why did the American invading army, possessing planes, cannons, and modern equipment, suffer a slump in morale as soon as it arrived on the South Vietnamese battlefield? Listen to the invaders' own answers! One American second lieutenant replied, "I don't know why the American government sent me to South Vietnam? Almost every Vietnamese person is hostile to us, and I feel very sad." Another American lieutenant refused to carry out combat orders, and his superior asked him why. He replied bluntly, "The American war in Vietnam is not worth sacrificing an American." Another American prisoner of war said, "I am very willing to listen to English broadcasts from Hanoi and hope that the struggle of the people of the world against the American government's aggression against Vietnam will become even more vigorous, so that I can return home soon." This is the state of mind determined by the nature of the US imperialism's unjust war of aggression, a fundamental contradiction that no new weapon can overcome.

    手持着现代武器的怕死鬼
      从“低下头来”
      到“嚎啕大哭”
    在侵朝战争中，在美国侵略军的前线阵地上，曾经流行着这样一句话：“低下头来！”十几年后的今天，美国侵略军已经从当年的“低下头来”发展到“嚎啕大哭”。在南越战场上，一旦遇到了生命危险，他们的士兵哭，军官也哭；步兵哭，伞兵也哭；甚至派到南越伪军中的美国“顾问”们，也仰天嚎啕，大哭不已。
    在前线，我们访问过参加保邦战斗的南越解放军部队。刚从战场上回来的这个部队的打虎英雄们，把美军士气概括为三部曲：开始是不敢露头，接着是丢枪逃跑，最后是嚎啕大哭。他们一听到枪响，就惊惶失措。一些在军官驱使下不得不硬着头皮冲锋的士兵，一旦被打退，就纷纷跑到战车后面嚎啕大哭。
    一天，我们到打过美军一七三空降旅的一个连队，副班长黎洪明绘声绘色地向我们介绍战场上美军的丑态：“美国鬼子进攻时不敢分散，更不敢迂回，总是三五成群地向前爬，他们满头大汗，气喘吁吁，惊惶失措的样子，非常可笑；每次打退美军的进攻，就听到他们阵地一片哭声。开始，我们还以为是牛叫，仔细一听，原来是他们的哭声，大家都笑了。这时候，我们就打单发，一枪一个。”正谈着，围上来一群战士，有一个年轻的战士插嘴说：“当时我们就互相鼓励说，‘敌人被我们打哭啦，我们要狠狠地打，让他们哭的更凶吧！’”说得周围的战士们都大笑起来。
    把头埋在土堆里
    “美国军官怕死，‘顾问’更怕死。”战士们轻视地说：“距离远时，他们还敢拿着手枪抗拒，当我们冲上去时，他们就吓得丢掉手枪，拼命地逃跑了。”
    在平也战斗中，当解放军一直插进伪军营指挥所时，一个正在用两支枪抵抗的美国“顾问”，吓得一手丢掉转轮手枪，一手扔出冲锋枪，只顾把头埋在土堆里打哆嗦。解放军战士冲过去叫他举手投降，他颤抖地举起双手跪下来，嘴里叽哩呱啦地喊饶命。因为在丛林中俘虏不易看押，解放军战士不得不把他们捆起来，当时只用一根藤条，捆不住，这个吓得面如土色的美国“顾问”，急忙用手指着自己的衣袋，让战士取出美国制的尼龙绳子捆他。美军俘虏的这种丑态，受到了战士们卑视的一笑。一个战士讽刺地说：“美军的自觉性很高啊！”
    “但愿上帝保佑”
    约翰逊政府为了提高侵越美军的士气，曾经费尽了心思。它们在西贡成立了战争心理研究机关，对美军及其帮凶军灌输侵略思想。它们用林肯的诗来麻痹欺骗广大士兵，使其能够为“保卫美国的自由”而卖命。同时，它们还采取一系列的物质刺激的办法，可是，这种笼络收买的办法，得到的回答是什么呢？一封从美国寄来的美军士兵家信中这样写道：“我们全家希望你千方百计保住性命，快想办法离开南越，回家团圆。”美国士兵的回信写道：“……这个战争，不知何时才能打完。算了，一切听天由命吧！遇到危险，只好求上帝保佑。”
    由于美国兵源困难，约翰逊政府不得不一再延长侵越美军的服役期限，这就使美军的士气愈来愈坏。在前线，我们曾经看过从一个美军中士埃俄·弗朗斯身上缴获的他和他妻子来往的信件。他的妻子劝他“不要去参加扫荡，挨到服役期满就快点回家”。这位已经四十二岁的老中士官在回信中写道：“我的服役期本来已满，可是在上级的强迫下，不得不把服役期延长，但愿上帝保佑，能够安全回家……”。但是，这位中士还没有写完这封信，就被驱上前线，在他妻子不愿让他参加的“扫荡”中被打死了。
    稻草人样的软骨头
    为什么拥有飞机、大炮现代装备的美国侵略军，一来到南越战场士气就一蹶不振呢？请听听侵略者自己的回答吧！一个美军少尉回答道：“不知美国政府把我送到南越来干什么？几乎每个越南人都敌视我们，我感到非常悲哀。”另一个美军中尉拒不执行战斗命令，上司问他为什么？他干脆地回答：“美国在越南的战争，不值得牺牲一个美国人。”还有一个美军俘虏说：“我很愿意听河内的英语广播，希望世界人民反对美国政府侵略越南的斗争更高涨，我好早日回家。”这就是美帝国主义非正义的侵略战争本质所决定的精神状态，是任何新式武器也克服不了的根本矛盾。
