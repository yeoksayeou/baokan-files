　　New Xinmi Coal Mine Shaft Put into Production
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 3rd (electric dispatch) The Peigou shaft of the Xinmi Mining Bureau of Henan Province, with an annual output of 600,000 tons, was officially put into production on March 1st.
　　Xinmi Coal Mine is one of the larger local coal mines in Henan Province. It is rich in underground coal resources, and six pairs of mines have been built successively since liberation. There are also two pairs of shafts, each with an annual output of 600,000 tons, under construction.
　　The large amount of high-quality coal produced by this coal mine is mainly supplied to Hubei, Hunan and other provinces and some areas of Henan for the people's livelihood needs.
　　The newly built Peigou Mine was designed by the Wuhan Design Institute. Its entire production process, except for semi-mechanized coal mining on the working face, has achieved mechanization in power supply, ventilation, transportation, hoisting, and drainage systems.

    新密煤矿新建竖井投入生产
    新华社郑州三日电　河南新密矿务局新建年产六十万吨的裴沟竖井，在三月一日正式投入生产。
    新密煤矿是河南省较大的地方煤矿之一。这里地下煤炭资源丰富，解放以来已经陆续建成六对矿井。还有两对年产各六十万吨的竖井正在兴建中。
    这个煤矿生产的大量优质煤，主要是供给湖北、湖南等省和河南部分地区人民生活需要。
    新建裴沟矿井是由武汉设计院设计的。它的全部生产过程，除了工作面采煤是半机械化以外，供电、通风、运输、提升、排水等系统都实现了机械化。
