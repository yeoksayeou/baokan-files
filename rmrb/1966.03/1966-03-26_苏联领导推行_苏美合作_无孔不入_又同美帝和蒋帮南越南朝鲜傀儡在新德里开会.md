    Soviet Leaders Pervasively Promote "Soviet-U.S. Cooperation"
    Again Meet with U.S. Imperialists and Chiang Gang, South Vietnamese, and South Korean Puppets in New Delhi
    (Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 25th) – News from New Delhi: From the 22nd to the 24th, the Soviet Union, along with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, "Malaysia," the South Vietnamese and South Korean puppet groups, as well as the United States, Britain, and others, participated in the "United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East" meeting in New Delhi. Soviet representatives also used this occasion to echo the U.S. imperialists' "peace talk" conspiracy on the Vietnam issue and its policy of aggression in Asia.
    According to TASS reports, the head of the Soviet delegation, Volkov, in his speech on the 24th, disregarding the fact that U.S. imperialism is expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina, claimed that "in the region of the (Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East) activities, no problem cannot be resolved peacefully," and also touted the "Tashkent Declaration" concocted by the new Soviet leadership pursuing the Soviet-U.S. cooperation line, boasting that it was "an example for handling these (Asian) problems."
    According to the Indian Press Trust, Volkov also praised the "Asian Development Bank," a tool controlled by the United States to carry out economic aggression against Asian countries, in his speech, saying that as long as the members of the "Asian Development Bank" adhere to the "principle of equality and mutual benefit," it "will be useful."

    苏联领导推行“苏美合作”无孔不入
    又同美帝和蒋帮南越南朝鲜傀儡在新德里开会
    新华社二十五日讯　新德里消息：苏联在二十二日到二十四日又同蒋介石集团、“马来西亚”、南越和南朝鲜傀儡集团、以及美国、英国等一起，在新德里参加了“联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会”会议。苏联代表还利用这个场合来给美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和谈”阴谋和侵略亚洲的政策帮腔。
    据塔斯社报道，苏联代表团团长沃尔科夫在二十四日的发言中，不顾美帝国主义正在扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战争的事实，说什么“在（亚洲及远东经济）委员会活动的地区，没有任何问题是不可以和平地解决的”，他还抬出苏联新领导奉行美苏合作路线炮制的“塔什干宣言”，吹嘘它是“处理这些（亚洲）问题的范例”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，沃尔科夫在发言中还为美国控制的对亚洲各国进行经济侵略的工具——“亚洲开发银行”进行吹嘘，说是只要“亚洲开发银行”的成员“本着平等互利原则”，它“就会有用处”。
