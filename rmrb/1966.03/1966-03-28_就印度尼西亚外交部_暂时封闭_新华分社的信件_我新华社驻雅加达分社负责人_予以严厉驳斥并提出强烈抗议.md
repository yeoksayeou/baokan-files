    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Jakarta dispatch: The Director of the Information Department of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arratas, met with Zhang Haitao, the head of the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch, on March 25th and handed him a letter. This letter, issued by the Coordinating Minister for the President and Deputy Minister for Political Affairs of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry in the name of the Foreign Minister and signed by Arratas, unreasonably announced the “temporary closure” of the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch, revoked the press credentials of Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch reporters, suspended all their reporting activities, and stopped the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch from distributing Xinhua News Agency news releases in Indonesia. Zhang Haitao immediately issued a stern rebuttal and strong protest against this serious step taken by the Indonesian government to undermine relations between the two countries and the absurd excuses it used. The full text of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's letter is as follows:

To Mr. Zhang Haitao, Head of the Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta:

    Facts have shown that recently, the masses of the people have repeatedly expressed their anger towards the Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta through various statements, resolutions, or demonstrations. This is because the Indonesian people cannot accept the unfriendly propaganda campaign that the Xinhua News Agency has continuously carried out in its news reports on the development of the situation in Indonesia. Although this propaganda campaign has been severely warned, it still carries a tone of incitement and division and has a tendency to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. Noting this, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia believes that, in order to prevent further deterioration of the good relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, and to further ensure the personal safety of Xinhua News Agency reporters themselves in the face of the people's anger, it is necessary to take security measures against the Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta. Therefore, according to the order of the Coordinating Minister and Acting Foreign Minister, we hereby convey the decision of the Indonesian government to temporarily close the Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta. Accordingly, from today onwards, your credentials and those of your colleagues as permanent Jakarta-based reporters of the Xinhua News Agency are revoked, and we request that you immediately cease all reporting activities and stop distributing Xinhua News Agency news releases within Indonesia.

    Coordinating Minister for the President and Deputy Minister for Political Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, in the name of the Foreign Minister,
    Signed on behalf of Arratas, Director of the Information Department
    March 24, 1966
                 In Jakarta

    就印度尼西亚外交部“暂时封闭”新华分社的信件
    我新华社驻雅加达分社负责人
    予以严厉驳斥并提出强烈抗议
    新华社二十八日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚外交部新闻司司长阿拉塔斯三月二十五日约见新华社驻雅加达分社社长张海涛，并把一封信件交给了他。这封由印度尼西亚外交部总统筹人、政治事务副部长以外交部长名义发出的、由阿拉塔斯签字的信件无理宣布“暂时封闭”新华社驻雅加达分社，撤销新华社驻雅加达分社记者的记者证，停止他们的一切报道活动，并停止新华社雅加达分社在印度尼西亚发行新华社新闻稿。对于印度尼西亚政府采取的这一破坏两国关系的严重步骤及其所持的荒谬借口，张海涛当即予以严厉的驳斥并提出强烈的抗议。印度尼西亚外交部的信件全文如下：雅加达新华通讯社社长张海涛先生敬启者：
    事实已表明：最近人民群众通过各种声明、决议或示威游行一再表现他们对雅加达新华通讯社的愤怒情绪。这是因为印度尼西亚人民不能接受新华通讯社在关于印度尼西亚局势发展的新闻报道中所不断进行的不友好的宣传运动，虽然这种宣传运动已受到严重警告，但是它仍然带着煽动性和分裂性的语调，并且具有干涉印度尼西亚内政的倾向。注意到这点，印度尼西亚共和国政府认为，为了防止印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国良好关系的进一步恶化，并且为了在人民表现其愤怒的情况下进一步保障新华社记者本身的人身安全，有必要对雅加达新华通讯社采取安全措施。因此，根据统筹部长兼代理外交部长阁下的命令，谨此转达印度尼西亚政府的决定，暂时关闭雅加达新华通讯社。据此，自今日起撤销你和你的同事们作为新华社常驻雅加达记者的证件，我们要求你立即停止一切报道活动和停止在印度尼西亚境内发行新华社新闻稿。
    外交部总统筹人、政治事务副部长以外交部长名义
    新闻司司长阿拉塔斯代签
    一九六六年三月二十四日
                于雅加达
