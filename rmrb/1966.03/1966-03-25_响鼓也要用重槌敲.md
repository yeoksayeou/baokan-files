    As the saying goes, "A fast horse doesn't need a whip, and a loud drum doesn't need a heavy hammer." Should a loud drum be struck with a heavy hammer? Recently, after reading "Ouyang Hai's Song," I have some new thoughts on this question.
    Should a loud drum be struck with a heavy hammer or tapped lightly? Regarding some shortcomings in a good seed like Ouyang Hai, should we accurately assess the situation and offer earnest help, loving him more deeply and assisting him more diligently, or should we fear dampening his enthusiasm and refrain from strict criticism, giving only a few light taps? The debate between instructor Zeng Wujun and company commander Guan Yingkui is very thought-provoking.
    A loud drum is still a loud drum without a heavy hammer, but advanced individuals are in danger of falling behind if they do not constantly, everywhere, and in every matter, take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and strive for self-improvement. Today, classes and class struggle still exist in society, and the dirty tentacles of the exploiting classes are striving to extend to all areas of social life. As a worker said, if proletarian ideology loosens, bourgeois ideology will attack. We must be vigilant; even a loud drum needs a heavy hammer.
    As the saying goes, "People get lost in the thick of things, and fear no one mentioning it." Advanced comrades have relatively high revolutionary consciousness. Therefore, people tend to overlook certain weaknesses in them and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards their mistakes, only offering a few superficial points. Zeng Wujun said it well: "The better a soldier is, the higher the demands should be placed on him, so that he can progress faster."
    Grasping both ends and bringing along the middle is a good method for doing ideological work. If we only focus on the ideological education of backward comrades, without grasping and timely helping the certain unfavorable tendencies in the thinking of advanced comrades, the advanced may transform to the opposite. How can a loud drum not be struck with a heavy hammer?
    To strike a loud drum with a heavy hammer, it must be struck in the right place, so that it will make a greater sound. Assistance to advanced individuals is only effective when effort is exerted at crucial moments. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as the steering wheel, proceed from the perspective of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and not concede an inch on matters of principle. As for trivial matters of daily life, there is no need to criticize too much, otherwise, it will make advanced individuals timid and at a loss. This is also worth noting.
    It was precisely under the constant hammering of instructor Zeng Wujun that Ouyang Hai gradually grew into a communist fighter. We must be like Zeng Wujun, strike even loud drums with a heavy hammer, and cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    响鼓也要用重槌敲
    北京通县永乐店农场下乡知识青年  朱洸
    俗话说：“快马不用鞭催，响鼓不用重槌。”究竟响鼓要不要用重槌敲呢，最近，读了《欧阳海之歌》，对这个问题有了一些新的想法。
    响鼓是用重槌敲呢，还是用轻槌点呢？对欧阳海这棵好苗子身上的一些缺点，是摸准情况，认真帮助，爱之愈深，帮之愈切呢，还是怕挫伤他的积极性，不进行严格的批评，只要点两下就行了呢？指导员曾武军和连长关英奎之间的一场争论，很发人深思。
    响鼓不用重槌仍是响鼓，但先进人物如果不时时、处处、事事以毛泽东思想为准绳，自强不息，就有跟不上趟的危险。今天，社会上还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，剥削阶级肮脏的触角竭力伸向社会生活各个领域。正如一个工人所说的，无产阶级思想松一松，资产阶级思想就攻一攻。我们可要警惕啊，响鼓也要用重槌敲。
    俗话说：人在事中迷，就怕没人提。先进同志革命觉悟是比较高的。因此，使人容易忽视他们身上的某些弱点，对他们的错误采取姑息迁就的态度，只是隔靴搔痒的点两下。曾武军说得好：“一个战士越是不错，对他的要求就应该越高，这样，他才能进步得更快”。
    抓两头，带中间，是做人的思想工作的好方法。如果我们只抓落后同志的思想教育，而没有去抓住先进同志思想中的某些不好的苗头，及时帮助，先进也就可能向对立面转化。响鼓怎么能不用重槌敲呢！
    用重槌敲响鼓，要敲的是地方，才会发出更大的声音。对先进人物的帮助，只有在节骨眼上使劲，才有效果。我们要拿毛泽东思想作方向盘，从兴无灭资的角度出发，原则问题分寸不让。至于鸡毛蒜皮的生活琐事，就不必过多指责，否则，又会使先进人物缩手缩脚，无所适从。这也是值得注意的。
    欧阳海正是在指导员曾武军不断用重槌敲打下，逐步成长为共产主义战士的。我们要象曾武军那样，响鼓也要用重槌敲，造就无产阶级革命事业接班人。
