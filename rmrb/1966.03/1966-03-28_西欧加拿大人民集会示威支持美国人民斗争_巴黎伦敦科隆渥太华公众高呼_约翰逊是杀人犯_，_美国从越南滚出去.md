    According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 25th - Several thousand people from all walks of life in Paris held a demonstration and march in front of the American Embassy in France on the evening of the 25th, protesting the American aggression against Vietnam and supporting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism.
    The demonstrators emphasized in their leaflets that this action was also to support the American people who are currently struggling against the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    In the Place de la Concorde, the demonstrators repeatedly shouted slogans such as "America is a murderer," and "Johnson is a murderer." The banners and signs they held read: "Down with American aggression in Vietnam," "Support the South Vietnam National Liberation Front," "America is Nazi, America go home," "The National Liberation Front is the only true representative of South Vietnam," "American leaders are the number one war criminals," "Immediately stop American aggression," "Withdraw all American troops from Vietnam," etc. In the procession, people held high the flags of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, London, March 26th - More than two hundred Londoners held a torchlight procession on the evening of the 26th to support the American people's protest movement against the U.S. government's aggression against Vietnam.
    As the marchers passed Downing Street, heavily guarded by police, they shouted angrily: "No intervention in Vietnam!" "American war-mongers get out, get out, get out!"
    A protest meeting was also held in London on the evening of the 25th. Ralph Schoenman, director of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, strongly condemned the American war of aggression against Vietnam, especially the barbaric torture and slaughter of the Vietnamese people by the United States.
    He said that the US government had violated all international agreements, and US President Johnson was a war criminal and executioner.
    Schoenman pointed out: "Talking about so-called peace negotiations is criminal and abhorrent, because so-called peace talks mean betraying the Vietnamese people."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, March 26th - Many cities in West Germany held mass demonstrations, rallies, and other activities to support the American people's protest movement against the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam.
    On the 26th, in Cologne, a large city in West Germany, about four hundred university students held a demonstration in the rain. The demonstrators marched through the city streets, holding placards and shouting slogans, and held a mass rally and distributed leaflets in a square near the city center.
    The placards held by the demonstrators read: "Yankees go home," "End the massacre of the Vietnamese people," "Support the Vietnamese people," "Oppose (West German government) support for the Vietnam War," "No (West) Germany shall participate in the massacre of people," etc. The demonstrators also shouted "Federal Chancellor Erhard, we warn you, do not give Nguyen Cao Ky aid," "Not a pfennig, not a person for the Vietnam War" during the march.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th - Helsinki dispatch: 250 people from all walks of life in Finland held a demonstration and march in Helsinki on the 24th to protest the American aggression against Vietnam.
    The demonstrators handed over a letter of protest to the American Embassy in Finland. The letter of protest pointed out that the Vietnam issue can only be finally resolved when the Americans withdraw from Vietnam.
    This protest activity was in support of the mass movement of the American people against the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, March 26th - Approximately four thousand Canadians held a massive demonstration and march in Ottawa on the 26th to support the American people's protest movement against American aggression against Vietnam.
    The demonstration was organized by many peace, student and religious groups from across the country. Demonstrators from more than a dozen major Canadian cities held a one-hour march and demonstration on the capital's main streets. The placards they held read: "US withdrawal from Vietnam is the only way to achieve peace," "Oppose America's dirty war" and "Stop supporting American slaughter and aggression." The flags of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front fluttered in the demonstration procession. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Withdraw American troops" and "We want Vietnam, not Yankees."
    As the marching procession passed the gate of the American Embassy, the crowd shouted "Yankees go home" and "Johnson - murderer."
    This demonstration was the largest demonstration in Ottawa's history. Participants included students, pastors and other people from all walks of life. Workers, led by the banner of the "Labor Against the Vietnam War Committee," also participated in the demonstration.
    After the demonstration, a mass rally was held in front of the Parliament, where representatives of various groups spoke, condemning American aggression against Vietnam.
    During the march, the Progressive Workers Movement of Canada issued a statement calling on "workers and oppressed people of the world to unite." The statement said: "American imperialism is the enemy of the people of all countries, not only of Vietnam, but also of the Dominican Republic, Congo, Indonesia and the American people themselves. American imperialism is the enemy of Canadian workers, students and intellectuals." The statement said: "The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people. Canadians must support and assist the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in its just struggle against American rule and oppression."
    A letter of appeal issued by the Toronto End the Vietnam War Liaison Committee said that action must be taken to end the American war of aggression against Vietnam. This war launched by the United States "is an unjust war, a barbaric war." The letter of appeal said that the Vietnamese people "demand the right to manage their own lives and choose their own form of government. This is what they are fighting for."

    西欧加拿大人民集会示威支持美国人民斗争
    巴黎伦敦科隆渥太华公众高呼“约翰逊是杀人犯”，“美国从越南滚出去”
    据新华社巴黎二十五日电  巴黎各界几千人二十五日晚上在协和广场美国驻法国大使馆前面举行示威游行，抗议美国侵略越南，支持越南人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争。
    示威群众在他们的传单上强调指出，这次行动也是为了支持目前正在为反对约翰逊政府侵略越南的政策而进行斗争的美国人民。
    在协和广场上，示威群众不断高呼“美国是杀人犯”，“约翰逊是杀人犯”等口号。他们高举着的横幅和标语牌上写着：“打倒美国在越南的侵略”，“支持越南南方民族解放阵线”，“美国是纳粹，美国滚回去”，“民族解放阵线是越南南方唯一的真正代表”，“美国领导人是头号战争罪犯”，“立即制止美国的侵略”，“从越南撤走所有的美国军队”等。在游行队伍中，人们高举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。
    据新华社伦敦二十六日电二百多伦敦市民二十六日晚间举行火炬游行，支持美国人民反对美国政府侵略越南的抗议运动。
    游行的人群在经过由警察层层设防的唐宁街的时候，愤怒高呼：“不准干涉越南！”“美国战争贩子滚出去，滚出去，滚出去！”
    二十五日晚在伦敦也举行了抗议集会。罗素和平基金会董事拉尔夫·休恩曼在会上严厉谴责美国对越南的侵略战争，特别是美国野蛮地对越南人民进行严刑拷打和屠杀。
    他说，美国政府破坏了一切国际协定，美国总统约翰逊是战争罪犯和刽子手。
    休恩曼指出：“谈论所谓和平谈判是犯罪和令人憎恶的，因为所谓的和谈意味着出卖越南人民。”
    据新华社波恩二十六日电西德许多城市举行群众示威、集会等活动，声援美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵越战争的抗议运动。
    二十六日在西德大城市科隆，约四百名大学生冒雨举行示威。示威者举着标语牌，高呼口号游行穿过市街，并在市中心附近的一个广场上举行群众集会和散发传单。
    示威者举着的标语牌上写着：“美国佬滚出越南去”，“结束对越南人民的屠杀”，“声援越南人民”，“反对（西德政府）支持越南战争”，“不许（西）德国参加屠杀人民”等。示威者在游行时还高呼“联邦总理艾哈德，我们警告你，不许给阮高其援助”，“不为越南战争出一芬尼，一个人”。
    新华社二十六日讯  赫尔辛基消息：芬兰各界人民二百五十人二十四日在赫尔辛基举行示威游行和集会，抗议美国侵略越南。
    示威者交给美国驻芬兰大使馆一封抗议信。抗议信指出，只有美国人从越南撤走才能最后解决越南问题。
    这次抗议活动是对美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵越战争的群众运动的声援。
    新华社渥太华二十六日电大约四千名加拿大人二十六日在渥太华举行声势浩大的示威游行，声援美国人民反对美国侵略越南的抗议运动。
    这次示威是由全国各地许多和平、学生和宗教团体组织的。来自加拿大十多个大城市的示威者在首都的主要街道上举行了一小时的游行示威。他们举的标语牌上写着：“美军撤出越南是实现和平的唯一道路”，“反对美国的肮脏战争”和“停止支持美国的屠杀和侵略”。示威行列中飘扬着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。示威者高呼“撤出美军”、“要越南，不要美国佬”等口号。
    当游行队伍经过美国大使馆大门的时候，群众高呼“美国佬滚回去”，“约翰逊——杀人凶手”。
    这次示威是渥太华有史以来最大的一次示威。参加示威的有学生、牧师和其他各界人士。参加示威的还有以“劳工反对越南战争委员会”的大旗为前导的工人。
    示威以后在议会前面举行了群众集会，各团体的代表讲话，谴责美国侵略越南。
    在游行过程中，加拿大进步工人运动发表声明，呼吁“全世界的工人和被压迫的人民联合起来。”声明说：“美帝国主义是各国人民的敌人，不仅是越南、而且是多米尼加共和国、刚果、印度尼西亚和美国本国人民的敌人。美帝国主义是加拿大工人、学生和知识分子的敌人。”声明说：“越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民唯一真正的代表。加拿大人必须支持和援助越南南方民族解放阵线反对美国统治和压迫的正义斗争。”
    多伦多结束越南战争联络委员会发表的呼吁书说，必须采取行动来结束美国侵略越南的战争。由美国发动的这场战争“是非正义战争，是野蛮的战争”。呼吁书说，越南人民“要求管理自己生活和选择自己的政府形式的权利。这就是他们为之而奋斗的东西”。
