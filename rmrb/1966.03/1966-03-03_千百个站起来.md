    Thousands Upon Thousands Stand Up
    The barbarous act of the pro-American dictatorial government of Colombia in savagely murdering the prominent Colombian figure Camilo Torres has ignited a new wave of struggle among the Colombian people. The bloody massacres of the reactionaries have played the role of mobilizing the people, and this historical law has once again been verified.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: The various persecutions that reactionaries inflict upon the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote a broader and more intense revolution by the people.
    Imperialism and all reactionaries always rely on bayonets to maintain their rule over the people. They believe that the more people they kill, the more stable their rule will be. However, the facts are always contrary to their wishes. The more brutal and vicious the reactionary rulers are, the more they expose their reactionary face, thereby promoting the awakening of the broad masses of the people, so that they not only understand that they must rise up to resist, but also understand how they should resist. Although Torres was a preaching priest, the bloody crimes of the reactionaries aroused his patriotism, causing him to resolutely leave the church, head to the mountains, take up arms, and participate in the struggle. In a declaration he made not long ago, he pointed out that the reason he joined the National Liberation Army was "so that future Colombians can have their own homeland that does not depend on the strong power of the United States."
    Now, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism have murdered Father Torres. However, when one person falls, thousands upon thousands stand up. The new anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle wave that is rising in Colombia shows that Camilo Torres' blood has not been shed in vain. More and more patriots will surely follow in his footsteps and embark on the revolutionary road of striving for national liberation.

    千百个站起来
    哥伦比亚亲美独裁政府野蛮杀害哥伦比亚著名人士卡米洛·托雷斯的暴行，激起了哥伦比亚人民新的斗争浪潮。反动派的血腥屠杀，起了动员人民的作用，这一历史规律又一次得到了验证。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。
    帝国主义和一切反动派总是要靠刺刀来维持它们对人民的统治。他们认为，杀人越多，他们的统治就越稳固。但是，事实总是同它们的愿望相反。反动统治者越残暴凶恶，就越暴露出它们的反动面目，从而促使广大人民的觉醒，使他们不仅懂得了必须起来反抗，而且懂得了应当怎样反抗。托雷斯虽然是一个传教的神父，但是反动派的血腥罪行却激发了他的爱国心，使他毅然决然地离开教堂，奔向山区，拿起武器，参加斗争。他在不久以前发表宣言指出，他之所以参加民族解放军是为了“使未来的哥伦比亚人能够有一个自己的、不依靠于美国强权的祖国”。
    现在，美帝国主义的走狗把托雷斯神父杀害了。但是，一个人倒下去，千百个站起来。在哥伦比亚正在兴起的新的反美反独裁斗争浪潮，表明卡米洛·托雷斯的鲜血并没有白流。必将有越来越多爱国者沿着他的足迹走上争取民族解放的革命道路。
