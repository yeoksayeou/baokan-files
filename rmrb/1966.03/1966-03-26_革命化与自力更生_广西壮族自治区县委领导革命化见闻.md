    Revolutionization and Self-Reliance
    ——Observations on the Revolutionization of County Committee Leadership in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

    Editor's Note: Many county committees in Guangxi arm their minds with the spirit of self-reliance, educate the broad masses, guide current work, and formulate future plans. The mental outlook of the people has undergone tremendous changes, and so has production and construction.

    Promoting the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of Dazhai is one of the important guidelines for building a new socialist countryside. Our peasants are diligent and brave, and they have the desire and the strength to build the country and their hometowns by relying on their own strength. As long as leaders at all levels, following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, concentrate the demands of the masses and arm them with the thought of self-reliance, the Party's correct policy, which embodies the demands of the broad masses, can be transformed into an immeasurable material force.

    Recently, we visited the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and saw an inspiring atmosphere: many county committees, in the process of realizing ideological revolutionization, raised high the revolutionary banner of self-reliance. They use the spirit of self-reliance to guide current work, summarize past experiences, and plan future construction. All counties have established Dazhai-style communes and production teams in their respective areas, striving to promote and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of these units.

    Experience from many county committees proves that establishing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is not an easy task, and it involves sharp ideological struggle. The focus of the struggle lies in whether or not the policy of implementing production revolution can be based on relying on one's own strength. This struggle is usually manifested through issues such as how to handle the relationship between leaders and the masses, the relationship between people and things, the relationship between self-reliance and state support, the relationship between current interests and long-term interests, and so on. How to implement the policy of self-reliance is an important problem that must be solved in the process of county committee leadership revolutionization.

            Leaders must have Dazhai in their hearts

    Many counties in Guangxi have established Dazhai-style red flags in their respective areas, calling on the people of the entire county to learn from these red flags. However, many of these newly established Dazhai-style red flags did not just appear now, but have existed for a long time. Why weren't they erected in the past? Comrades from many county committees say that the problem lies with the leadership. Only with revolutionary leadership can revolutionary things existing among the masses be discovered, summarized, and promoted in a timely manner, otherwise they will be overlooked.

    Xishan Commune in Gui County, with nine thousand mu of cultivated land, is often hit by drought, relies on state-supplied grain every year, and has a very low standard of living. Poverty leads to change. Beginning in the autumn of 1964, more than four thousand commune members, under the leadership of the Party branch, learned from Dazhai and resolved to work hard, not wanting a single yuan from the state, and started building a 15-li-long water diversion canal. This canal is all filling work, with a total earthwork volume of nearly 300,000 cubic meters. Last autumn, half of the task had been completed. After the project is completed, all cultivated land can be turned into "water-conserving fields." The goal set by the commune members is: strive not to rely on state-supplied grain this year.

    The county knew about Xishan Commune's construction of the canal at that time. A responsible comrade even went to see it and was deeply moved by the hardworking spirit of the masses, and took the initiative to support it with an investment of one thousand yuan. As county committee leaders, they should have taken this opportunity to make a big deal, raised high the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance of Xishan Commune, and promoted ideological revolution and production revolution in other places. Unfortunately, the Gui County Committee did not do this at that time, but just gave some money and that was it.

    Why didn't they recognize the self-reliant "thousand-mile horse" when they saw it at that time? According to the responsible comrade of the Gui County Committee, it was because the county committee leadership still had problems in their mental state at that time. In 1965, in the process of revolutionization, the county committee inspected and criticized the erroneous ideas of arrogance, complacency, and contentment with the status quo, and resolved to work hard for three years to overcome the water conservancy barrier. Therefore, they put forward a large-scale water conservancy plan. However, they placed this plan on the basis of reaching out to the state for money. The water conservancy projects managed by the county alone required a state investment of more than 2.3 million yuan. However, the higher authorities only approved more than 800,000 yuan. What to do? At this time, the county committee further established its determination to achieve production revolution through self-reliance and reliance on the masses. The self-reliant red flag of Xishan Commune was also raised by the county committee. With the raising of this red flag, the spirit of self-reliance in the entire county was greatly boosted, and the original water conservancy construction plan was still strived to be completed despite the reduction of state investment.

    Many county committee comrades have such experiences when talking about establishing Dazhai-style red flags. This is a very important experience, which shows that whether a county promotes the spirit of self-reliance actually reflects the mental state of the county committee leadership. If a county wants to change the economic face of its region through production revolution, it must first establish the ambition to change the world; however, this alone is not enough. It is also necessary to solve the problem of how to turn ambition into reality, that is, to rely on the masses, strive for progress, and be self-reliant, otherwise ambition will only be an empty slogan. Only when the county committee has the Dazhai spirit in its heart can it find the local Dazhai and have the possibility of raising high the red flag of self-reliance among the masses.

              Use revolutionary viewpoints to look at poverty

    As a county, from establishing Dazhai-style red flags to forming a situation of forests of red flags, there is a process of correctly viewing conditions, relying on the masses to change conditions, and creating conditions. This raises the question of what poor places rely on to turn themselves around, and the question of what is the decisive condition for turning around.

    Guangxi has poor counties and poor communes and production teams. What is called poverty is relative. Compared with before liberation, some poor places are rich; if compared with places with faster production development, they are poor, and can also be called backward. What do poor places rely on to turn themselves around? The self-reliant red flags established by various counties in Guangxi this time all prove that they must rely on revolution, rely on self-reliance, rely on people's hard labor, and rely on their own hands to create conditions. However, there has not been a lack of struggle in this regard, and this struggle is also first reflected in the thinking of the county committee leadership.

    The Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous County has always been "three dependent" – dependent on state-supplied grain for food, dependent on relief for money, and dependent on support for production. Is the problem with the masses? No. Originally, the county committee thought that it was poor and also a minority ethnic area, so it regarded itself as the state's "full son" (youngest son) and felt that relying on the state was justified. The county committee's eyes saw mostly the poor production base, backward production technology, thin family background, large mountains and deep gullies, and the suffering of the masses, etc., and always thought that there was a lack of conditions for turning around. This is naturally not a revolutionary viewpoint. The main error in using this viewpoint to look at poverty is that it does not see the human factor, the dynamic role of people, the wisdom of people, and the great labor of people, and it regards the human factor as very small and the image of difficulties as very large. In this way, it is inevitable to draw the conclusion that poor places cannot rely on their own strength to turn themselves around. This is an idea that is opposed to the policy of self-reliance, and of course there can be no Dazhai spirit.

    The revolutionization movement has changed the mental outlook of the Yao Autonomous County Committee. The county committee criticized the idea of dependency and found that the ideological root cause was a lack of revolutionary ideals, a lack of mass viewpoints, and a lack of perseverance in overcoming difficulties. Then, the county committee made up its mind: to make revolution, no longer be a "full son," strive for progress, be self-reliant, and change the backward outlook. The county committee's viewpoint changed, and the things in its eyes also changed. It saw the strength of the people in the entire county. Therefore, the entire county was mobilized to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, build terraced fields on a large scale, and plant green manure on a large scale. The masses were in high spirits and broke old habits, starting water conservancy projects before the autumn harvest last year. The Dazhangma Commune in this county originally planned to build a canal and waited for the state to give money every year without taking action. Last year, they didn't wait and did it themselves. At that time, they didn't even have hammers for breaking stones or iron bars for prying stones. It was really difficult enough. The commune members were not discouraged. They used large stones as hammers and hard wood as iron bars and quickly opened up the canal. In the eyes of the county committee, Dayaoshan not only has revolutionary masses, but Dayaoshan has also become a good place with abundant products and good for developing production and diversified operations. The determination of the people of the entire county is: strive not to rely on state-supplied grain this year!

    Many county committees have realized that by using revolutionary viewpoints and class viewpoints to look at poverty, they can see the strength of the revolutionary class of poor and lower-middle peasants, and they can see the revolutionary aspirations of the people, that is, poor people have great ambitions. There is nothing more solid in the world than revolutionary aspirations. With revolutionary people, they can be invincible and change the world. Otherwise, even if a few red flags are erected, if the conditions of backward places cannot be universally analyzed with revolutionary viewpoints and the revolutionary factors are seen, it will be impossible to widely mobilize and organize the masses to take the road of self-reliance. A few red flags will only be "a little red among the green," and it will be impossible for flowers to bloom everywhere.

              Correctly use state support

    Is it easier to do things with more money from state support? It should be said that it is good in some ways, but not in others.

    Comrades from the Wuming County Committee told us: "In the past, we liked to reach out to higher authorities for money, always thinking that it would be good to mobilize the masses and get things done with money. When the money came, it was distributed downwards without doing people's work and without mobilizing the masses. As a result, the people below developed the habit of doing things if they were given money, and not doing them if they were not given money. This lesson is too great!" The county committee cited an example to illustrate the process of its own ideological change. The state invested in building a large dam in the Fuliang Commune. Soon, the dam foundation leaked. In 1963, the county instructed the commune to repair it and took the initiative to allocate cement, only requiring the commune to find a little sand by itself. Because ideological work was not done and the masses were not mobilized, the commune refused to do it and refused to do it until the county sent the sand. This dragged on for two years. After the socialist education movement, the matter of repairing the dam foundation was re-proposed. After mobilizing the masses to discuss it, everyone only asked the county to subsidize half of the materials. Not only did they repair the old dam, but they also designed and built a new dam themselves.

    Where is the lesson? The lesson lies in how to view money, is it money in command, or is it politics in command.

    The state's support for agriculture and for poor teams is a revolutionary measure, which fully embodies the superiority of the socialist system and embodies the Party's concern for the people's production and life. Therefore, it should not be seen simply as a sum of money, but as a political force of the Party and the state to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, when using state support, the correct approach for the county committee should be to first give the masses the revolutionary thought of self-reliance, first boost their enthusiasm, and mobilize the positive factors of people, and then supplement it with support, so as to fully exert the role of state support. By doing so, even if the support is very small, or no support is given, big things can still be done.

    Conversely, if money and materials are put in command, only material support is given, but no revolutionary ideas are given, and there is no politics in the eyes, the support will not play a positive role, and it is also easy to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses. Comrades from the Wuming County Committee told us that there is a Laipo Commune in this county with many difficulties in production and life. A responsible comrade from the county went to inspect the work and did not mobilize the cadres and the masses to change the situation through self-reliance, but only gave them 20,000 yuan and left. Two years have passed, and the appearance of this commune has not changed, and the Party branch secretary is still constantly complaining, complaining that other leaders in the county did not give them money. Some communes received more support and produced more grain, but were heavily in debt, and as a result, increased production did not increase income. In these places, it seems that the masses have ideological problems, but in fact they are harmed by the erroneous ideas of the leaders, harmed by the leaders' viewpoints of bestowing favors, only knowing things but not knowing people, and ignoring politics.

    Money needs people to use it, and it is not enough to rely on money alone. Giving only money but not revolutionary ideas actually gives the masses the idea of dependence. Giving revolutionary ideas, and then supplementing them with necessary money and material support, can not only promote the ideological revolution of people, but also effectively promote the production revolution. This is a valuable lesson learned by many county committees from practice, which shows that when implementing the policy of self-reliance, they are not just staying on the level of rhetoric, but are going deep into the actual work process.

            How to stand in an invincible position

    Four districts in Yulin County carried out the socialist education movement, and in 1965, grain production increased by more than 40%. Under the excellent situation of a large increase in production, the county committee discovered a matter that deserves vigilance: one production team was invested by the state with 900 yuan to build a warehouse. After the investment was spent, only half of the warehouse was built, and they stopped and waited for the state to give more money, unwilling to use the conditions of a bumper harvest to complete the warehouse construction. This situation aroused the attention of the county committee. Coupled with some other situations, the county committee realized that these places lacked the spirit of self-reliance and requested that another self-reliance education be carried out in these four districts to make up for this important lesson. This is an important sign of the Yulin County Committee raising high the revolutionary banner of self-reliance and highlighting politics.

    Recently, based on the investigation and research on the actual situation of the entire county, the Yulin County Committee put forward a plan for the entire county to realize water conservancy, gardenization, greening, and increase the yield per unit area. This is a grand plan, and it will take several years of hard work to achieve it. What is even more gratifying is that the entire plan does not include state investment or other aspects of support, and everything relies on one's own efforts. Comrades from the county committee said: "Now revolution is everywhere, and everyone is working hard and striving for progress through self-reliance. We do not place all our hopes on state support. We think about what to do if we encounter special circumstances? We believe that we must increase production even if we have no money or chemical fertilizer. We have to feed ourselves and give more grain to the country. This is the only way. We have already made this clear to the masses. Leading production with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance will result in not only grain, but also the cultivation of revolutionary people and strong revolutionary organizations. We are not afraid of any situation!" In other counties, when talking about self-reliance, comrades from the county committee also often ask themselves: what to do in special circumstances, what to do in years of continuous natural disasters, whether to support the country in the most difficult times, and whether we can stand in an invincible position in any storm? That is to say, many county committees no longer regard self-reliance simply as a matter of improving the lives of the local people, but also as a matter of making more contributions to the country; not only as a matter of the present, but also as a matter of the long term; not only as a matter of production revolution, but also as a matter of cultivating revolutionary organizations and revolutionary people. This is the comprehensive viewpoint of implementing the policy of self-reliance, and also the high standard of implementing self-reliance, which shows that people are no longer regarding self-reliance as an expedient measure, but as a strategic idea to be implemented. In this way, they can stand in an invincible position.

    According to our understanding, this idea is actually a reflection of the guiding ideology of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee. In order to promote the revolutionization of leading cadres at all levels in the region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee instructed cadres throughout the region to promote various tasks with the viewpoints of class struggle, self-reliance, and serving the people, and required all cadres not to be mediocre people who are content with the status quo, afraid of difficulties, and do nothing, but to be thorough revolutionaries who are based in Guangxi, have the world in mind, dare to shoulder heavy responsibilities, and constantly make revolution. This has had a profound impact on the revolutionization of county committees and has played a huge role in promoting the implementation of the self-reliance policy.

    革命化与自力更生
    ——广西壮族自治区县委领导革命化见闻
    编者按：广西许多县委以自力更生的精神武装自己的头脑，教育广大的群众，指导当前的工作，制订未来的规划。人们的精神面貌发生了巨大变化，生产建设也就发生了巨大变化。
    发扬大寨艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，是建设社会主义新农村的重要方针之一。我国农民是勤劳勇敢的，是有依靠自己的力量建设国家、建设家乡的要求和力量的。只要各级领导者按照毛泽东同志的教导，把群众这种要求集中起来，给以自力更生的思想武装，党的这个体现广大群众要求的正确方针，就能变成不可估量的物质力量。
    最近，我们访问了广西壮族自治区，看到一种令人振奋的气象：许多县委在实现思想革命化的过程中，把自力更生的革命大旗高高举起。他们用自力更生的精神指导当前的工作，总结过去的经验，规划未来的建设。各县都树立了本县大寨式的公社、生产队，力求使这些单位的革命精神发扬光大。
    根据许多县委的经验证明，树立自力更生的革命精神，不是一件容易的事情，其中包含着尖锐的思想斗争。斗争的焦点，在于能不能把实行生产革命的方针放在依靠自己力量的基点上。这个斗争，通常是通过如何处理领导与群众的关系、人与物的关系、自己动手与国家支援的关系、目前利益与长远利益的关系等等问题表现出来。如何贯彻自力更生的方针，是县委领导革命化过程中必须解决的一个重要问题。
            领导心里必须有大寨
    广西许多县都树立了本县大寨式的红旗，号召全县人民向这些红旗看齐。但是，其中有许多新树起的大寨式的红旗，并不是现在才有的，而是早存在的。为什么过去没有树立起来？许多县委的同志说，问题在于领导。只有有了革命的领导，才能及时发现、总结、推广群众中存在的革命的事物，否则会视而不见。
    贵县西山公社，九千亩耕地经常遭受旱灾，年年吃统销粮，生活水平很低。穷则思变。一九六四年秋天开始，全社四千多社员在党支部领导下学大寨，决心苦干，不要国家一元钱，动手建设一条长十五华里的引水渠道。这条渠全部是垫方，总工程量近三十万土方，去年秋天已完成任务的一半，工程竣工后可使全部耕地变成“保水田”。社员们提出的奋斗目标是：争取今年就不吃统销粮。
    西山公社建设水渠的事，县上当时就知道，一位负责同志还去看过，而且被群众的苦干精神深深感动，主动地支援给一千元投资。作为县委的领导，应该趁此大作文章，把西山公社自力更生革命精神高高举起，推动其它地方的思想革命和生产革命。可惜的是，当时贵县县委没有这样做，只是给了一点钱就完了。
    为什么那时候见到了自力更生的千里马而没有识别出来呢？据贵县县委负责同志谈，是由于当时县委领导在精神状态上还存在问题。一九六五年，县委在革命化的过程中，检查、批判了骄傲自满、安于现状的错误思想，决心大干三年闯过水利关，于是提出了一个规模很大的水利计划。但是，他们却把这个计划放在伸手向国家要钱的基础上。仅仅县管的水利工程，就要求国家投资二百三十多万元。可是，上边只批了八十多万元，怎么办？这时，县委才进一步树立了自力更生、依靠群众实现生产革命的决心。西山公社这面自力更生的红旗，也才被县委举起。这面红旗一举，全县自力更生精神大振，在国家减少投资的情况下，仍然争取完成原订的水利建设计划。
    许多县委的同志在谈到树大寨式的红旗时，大都有这样的体会。这是个非常重要的经验，说明一个县发扬不发扬自力更生的精神，实际上反映出了县委领导的精神状态。一个县要想通过生产革命改变本地区的经济面貌，首先要立改天换地的雄心壮志；但是，只有这一点还不够，还必须解决如何把雄心壮志变为现实的路线问题，那就是依靠群众，奋发图强，自力更生，否则雄心壮志就只不过是一个空口号。县委心里有大寨精神，才能找到本地的大寨，才有可能把群众中的自力更生的红旗高高地举起。
              用革命观点看穷
    作为一个县，从树立大寨式的红旗到形成红旗如林的局面，有一个正确看待条件，依靠群众改变条件、创造条件的过程。这就有个穷地方翻身靠什么的问题，有个什么是翻身的决定性的条件的问题。
    广西有穷的县，也有穷的社队。所谓穷，是相对而言。拿一些穷的地方同解放以前比，是富了；如果同生产发展较快的地方比，就是穷的，也可以称为后进。穷地方翻身靠什么？这次广西各县树立的自力更生红旗，都证明要靠革命，靠自力更生，靠人的艰苦劳动，靠自己的双手去创造条件。但是在这方面并不是没有过斗争的，而这一斗争也首先反映在县委领导的思想上。
    大瑶山瑶族自治县，一向是“三依赖”——吃粮依赖统销，用钱依赖救济，生产依赖支援。问题在群众吗？不是。原来，县委思想上自以为穷，又是少数民族地区，便以国家的“满仔”（小儿子）自居，觉得依赖国家理所当然。县委的眼睛看到的多是生产基础差、生产技术落后、家底子薄、山大沟深、群众生活苦，等等，总认为缺少翻身的条件。这自然不是革命的观点。用这种观点看穷，主要的错误在于看不到人的因素、人的能动作用、人的智慧、人的伟大劳动，把人的因素看得很渺小，把困难的形象看得很高大，这样，就必然会得出穷地方无法依靠自己力量翻身的结论。这是同自力更生方针相对立的思想，当然也就不可能有大寨精神了。
    革命化运动，改变了瑶族自治县县委的精神面貌。县委批判了依赖思想，找出思想上的根源是缺乏革命理想，缺乏群众观点，缺乏战胜困难的毅力。接着，县委下定决心：要革命，不再当“满仔”，奋发图强，自力更生，改变落后面貌。县委的观点变了，眼中的事物也变了，看到了全县人民的力量。于是全县总动员，大修水利，大修梯田，大种绿肥。群众情绪高得很，打破了旧的习惯，在去年秋收以前就修水利工程。这个县的大樟马公社原计划修一条水渠，年年等国家给钱，没有动手，去年不等了，自己干，当时连打石头的锤、撬石头的铁棍都没有，确实够困难了。社员们并不气馁，用大石头当锤，用硬木头当铁棍，很快把渠修通了。在县委的眼睛里，大瑶山不但有革命的群众，大瑶山也成为物产丰富、发展生产和多种经营的好地方了。全县人民的决心是：争取今年就不吃统销粮！
    许多县委都体会到，用革命观点、阶级的观点看穷，就可以看到贫下中农这个革命阶级的力量，就可以看到人的革命志气，就是人穷志长。世界上没有再比革命志气更坚硬的东西了，有了革命的人便可以无坚不摧、改天换地。否则，虽然树起了几面红旗，如果不能用革命的观点普遍地分析落后地方的条件，看到革命的因素，便不可能去广泛地动员组织群众走自力更生的路，几面红旗只会是“万绿丛中点点红”，不可能花开遍地。
              正确使用国家支援
    国家支援的钱多了是不是就好办事了？要分两方面说，也好办，也不好办。
    武鸣县委的同志跟我们说：“过去，我们爱向上伸手要钱，总认为有了钱好发动群众，好办事。钱来了，往下分，不做人的工作，不发动群众，结果使下面养成了给钱就办，不给不办的习惯。这个教训太大了！”县委曾举出一个例子，说明自己思想变化的过程。国家曾投资在福良公社修了一座大水坝。不久，坝基渗水，一九六三年县里指示公社负责修补一下，并主动拨给了水泥，只要求公社自己想办法挖一点沙子，由于没有做思想工作，没有发动群众，公社不干，非等到县里送沙子去不干，一拖就是两年。社会主义教育运动后，修补坝基的事被重新提出，发动群众一讨论，大家只要求县上补助一半材料，不但补好了旧坝，自己还另外设计、建筑了一条新坝。
    这个教训在哪里？教训在如何看待钱，是钱挂帅，还是政治挂帅。
    国家对农业的支援、对穷队的支援，是一项革命的措施，充分体现了社会主义制度的优越性，体现了党对人民生产和生活的关怀。因此，不应该单单看到这是一笔钱，应看作是党和国家鼓舞人民群众积极性的政治力量。所以，县委在使用国家支援时，正确的做法应该是先给群众以自力更生的革命思想，先鼓干劲，把人的积极因素调动起来，再辅之以支援，才能充分发挥出国家支援的作用。这样做，即使支援的很少，或者不给支援，照样可以办大事情。
    反之，如果以钱以物挂帅，只给物质支援，不给革命思想，眼里无政治，支援就不会起到积极的作用，而且还容易腐蚀群众的革命斗志。武鸣县委的同志告诉我们，这个县有个赖坡公社，生产生活有不少困难，县上一位负责同志去检查工作，没有发动干部和群众自力更生改变面貌，只给了两万元便走了。两年过去了，这个公社的样子还是没有变，支部书记还不断发牢骚，埋怨县上其他领导人没有给他们钱。有的社虽然拿到的支援多，粮食也多打了，但负债累累，结果增产没有增加收入。这些地方，看起来是群众思想有问题，其实是领导上的错误思想害了他们，是领导上的恩赐观点、只知有物不知有人的观点、忽视政治的观点害了他们。
    钱要人用，单是靠钱是不行的。只给钱不给革命思想，实际上是给了群众依赖思想。给了革命思想，再辅以必要的钱和物的支援，既可促进人的思想革命，又能有效地推动生产革命。这是许多县委从实践中得到的一条可贵的经验教训，说明他们在贯彻自力更生方针时，已不是停留在口头上，而是深入到实际工作过程中去了。
            怎样才能立于不败之地
    玉林县有四个区进行了社会主义教育运动，一九六五年粮食都增产百分之四十以上。在大增产的大好形势下，县委发现了一件值得警惕的事：有一个生产队，国家给投资九百元盖仓库，投资花完了，仓库只盖了一半，便停下来等着国家再给钱，不愿意利用丰收的条件完成仓库建设。这一情况引起了县委的重视，加上其他一些情况，县委发觉这些地方的自力更生精神不足，要求在这四个区里再进行一次自力更生的教育，补足这重要的一课。这是玉林县委高举自力更生革命旗帜，突出政治的一个重要标志。
    最近，玉林县委根据对全县实际情况的调查研究，提出一个全县实现水利化、园田化、绿化、提高单位面积产量的规划。这是个宏伟的规划，要苦战几年才能实现。更可喜的是，整个规划没有计算上国家的投资和其他方面的支援，一切靠自己动手。县委的同志说：“现在到处都在革命，都在发奋图强，自力更生。我们不把一切希望寄托在国家支援上，我们想到遇到特殊情况怎么办？我们认为，没有钱、没有化肥也得增产，自己要吃饭，还要多给国家点粮，这才行。我们已经同群众讲清了这一点。用自力更生的革命精神领导生产，结果既有粮，又能培养出革命的人、培养出坚强的革命组织，无论遇到什么情况就不怕了！”在其他县里，县委的同志谈到自力更生时，也常反问自己：遇到特殊情况怎么办，连年灾荒怎么办，在最困难的时候要不要支援国家，在任何风浪中能不能立于不败之地？这就是说，许多县委已不但把自力更生看作是如何改善当地人民生活的事，也看作是对国家应有更多贡献的事；不但看作是眼前的事，也看作是长远的事；不但看作是生产革命的事，也看作是培养革命的组织、革命的人的事。这就是贯彻自力更生方针的全面观点，也是贯彻自力更生的高标准，说明人们已不是把自力更生当作权宜之计，而当作一个战略思想加以贯彻了。这样就可以立于不败之地。
    据我们了解，这种思想实际上是中共广西壮族自治区党委指导思想的反映。为促进全区各级领导干部的革命化，中共广西壮族自治区党委指示全区干部用阶级斗争的观点、自力更生的观点、为人民的观点推动各项工作，要求所有的干部不要作安于现状、害怕困难、碌碌无为的庸人，要作立足广西，胸怀世界，敢挑重担，不断革命的彻底革命者。这对县委革命化发生了深远的影响，对贯彻自力更生方针起到了巨大的推动作用。
