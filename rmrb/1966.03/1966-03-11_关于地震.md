    About Earthquakes
    An earthquake is a natural phenomenon, a reflection of crustal tectonic movement. When the force on underground rocks exceeds their inherent strength, the rock layers will rupture or move along existing fault surfaces, causing an earthquake. This type of earthquake is called a tectonic earthquake. In addition, there are volcanic earthquakes and collapse earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes and collapse earthquakes are generally not very strong and have less impact. More than ninety percent of earthquakes are tectonic earthquakes, which are more powerful and have a wider impact.
    The origin of an earthquake is called the hypocenter. The vertical projection from the hypocenter underground to the ground surface is called the epicenter. The impact and destructive effect of an earthquake depends on its magnitude: it is greatest in the epicenter area, and weakens with increasing distance from the epicenter. The magnitude of the earthquake's energy is expressed in terms of magnitude, which is measured by instruments. The impact and destructive degree of an earthquake is expressed in terms of intensity. Earthquake intensity is divided into twelve degrees. A first-degree earthquake cannot be felt by humans, and can only be recorded by seismographs; second to fifth degree earthquakes are felt earthquakes, which can be felt by humans and manifest as shaking furniture, falling soil from roofs, etc. From the sixth degree onwards, buildings suffer varying degrees of damage or destruction; tenth to twelfth degree earthquakes cause large-scale destruction, with huge cracks and deformations in the ground, widespread damage to buildings, and resulting disasters.
    Regions where earthquakes occur frequently are called seismic zones. The activity frequency and maximum possible intensity of each seismic zone are different. Seismic activity often does not occur in isolation. Assuming a series of earthquakes occur, the largest is generally called the mainshock, those occurring before the mainshock are called foreshocks, and those after the mainshock are called aftershocks. Usually, large earthquakes are always followed by aftershocks. The intensity of aftershocks gradually weakens with time, the frequency gradually decreases, and slowly tends to calm down. However, it is not necessarily true that each aftershock is smaller than the previous one, nor is the interval time necessarily longer than the previous one; rather, it declines in a wave-like manner.
    The period of earthquakes is very long, and data accumulation is slow. Although it is still difficult to predict the exact time of an earthquake, after studying the characteristics of seismic activity in a region, the seismic risk of that region can be estimated. As for predicting the specific time of strong earthquakes and observing and determining "precursors," scientists have done a lot of work, but have not yet achieved reliable results.
    The threat of earthquakes to human life is mainly caused indirectly by the collapse of buildings and landslides during vibrations. Landslides, rockfalls, and ground fissures often occur in places with loose rocks and soil, steep slopes, riverbanks, etc. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid these locations as much as possible during an earthquake. In places far away from the earthquake's origin, there are often relatively weak vibrations before the destructive vibrations arrive, giving people time to take cover. When a foreshock occurs, casualties and losses can be reduced if timely precautions and avoidance are taken. In extremely strong earthquakes, especially in places close to the epicenter, buildings often collapse immediately when the vibration begins. Strong vibrations generally last for a very short time. If it is too late to go outside to take cover indoors, temporarily taking shelter under a relatively solid barrier (such as solid furniture, etc.) can also avoid being injured. Relatively light earthquakes, although not enough to destroy the entire building, can still pose a threat to people due to falling eaves tiles, clods of earth, decorations, etc., so people should try to stay away from buildings. When we feel an earthquake, we should remain calm, and take countermeasures in an orderly manner based on the specific situation, avoiding injuries caused by crushing and bumping due to chaos. Some buildings, after an earthquake, may have internal damage even if there is no visible external damage, and are easily damaged by further vibrations. Therefore, safety measures should be taken for dangerous buildings as soon as possible; it is best to suspend their use until they are reinforced.

    关于地震
    地震是一种自然现象，是地壳构造运动的一种反映。当地下的岩石所受作用力超过它本身的强度时，岩层就要破裂或沿原有断裂面错动，引起地震。这种地震叫构造地震。此外，还有火山地震和陷落地震。火山地震和陷落地震的力量一般不太大，影响较小。百分之九十以上的地震是构造地震，这种地震威力较强，波及面较大。
    地震的发源处称为震源。由位于地下的震源中心至地面的垂直投影称为震中。地震的影响和破坏作用取决于地震本身的大小：震中区最大，离震中愈远则愈弱。地震本身能量的大小以震级表示，震级由仪器测得。地震的影响和破坏程度以烈度表示。地震烈度分为十二度。一度地震，人不能感觉到，只有地震仪器能记录到；二到五度为有感地震，人感觉得到，并表现为家具摇晃，房上掉土等。从六度起，房屋遭受不同程度的损坏或破坏；十度到十二度地震，则引起大范围的破坏，地面产生巨大裂缝和变形，建筑物普遍遭到破坏，造成灾害。
    经常发生地震的地区称为地震活动区。各地震区的活动频度和最大可能强度都不一样。地震活动往往不是单个出现的。假定发生了一系列地震，最大的通称主震，发生在主震前的叫前震，主震后的叫余震，通常大地震后总会发生余震，余震的强度随时间逐渐减弱，频度渐稀，慢慢趋于平静。不过，并不是每一次余震一定比前一次小，间隔时间也不一定比前一次长，而是波浪式地下降的。
    地震的周期很长，资料积累很慢。预报地震发生的时刻虽然还有困难，但在研究清楚一个地区地震活动的特点后，就可估计这一地区的地震危险性。至于预报强震发生的具体时刻，观察确定“前兆”这方面，科学家们虽已做了不少工作，但还没有取得可靠成果。
    地震对人类生命的威胁，主要是由于振动时建筑物的倒塌和山石崩裂等间接造成的。滑坡、滚石、地裂等现象往往发生在岩石、土层松散的地方及陡坡、河岸等处。因此，地震时宜尽量避开这些地点。在远离地震发生的地方，当引起破坏的振动到达以前，常有比较微弱的振动，使人能来得及躲避。在前震发生的时候，如果能够及时预防和躲避，是可以减少伤亡和损失的。极其强烈的地震，特别在距震中较近的地方，建筑物往往在开始振动时就立即倒塌。强烈振动一般持续很短，如在室内来不及外出躲避时，能暂避在较坚固的屏障（如坚实的家具等）下面，也可避免碰伤。比较轻的地震，虽不足以摧毁整个建筑物，然而檐瓦、土块、装饰物等的坠落，也能对人造成威胁，所以人们要尽量远离建筑物。当我们感到地震时，应该沉着，有秩序地根据具体情况，采取对策，要避免由于混乱造成的压伤、碰伤。有的建筑物经过地震后，外表虽无损坏，可能已有内伤，再遇振动很容易损坏。因此，对危险建筑物应及早采取安全措施；在没有加固以前，最好暂停使用。
