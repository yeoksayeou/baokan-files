    Grasp "Human Heads" First, Then Grab Hoes
    Last year, our unit undertook some production tasks, which involved reclaiming more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields. The first battle was to build a large embankment 3.6 meters high and 19 meters wide at the base within 40 days. Including the inner embankment project, the total earthwork was more than 130,000 cubic meters. Considering the manpower of our company, each person would have to move nearly 200 cubic meters on average. At that time, it was the coldest period of winter, with freezing temperatures and snow. Some soldiers developed thoughts of fearing hardship and difficulty. Some comrades reminded me to grasp "human heads" first, then grab hoes, so that the progress of the project would be guaranteed. However, at that time, my mind was filled with cubic meters of earth and stone, progress and quality. I thought that water conservancy construction was a rigid target. If we missed the season, the annual task would fail. We had to make a forced march. As for political and ideological work, if we didn't do it today, we could do it tomorrow. So, I desperately tried to save time. We mobilized everyone to work before dawn, and when brother units finished work, we were still working. Unexpectedly, the progress was still not as good as that of the brother companies, with an average of only four cubic meters completed per person per day.
    With this problem in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao. Only then did I begin to wake up, understand the relationship between politics and all tasks, and realize that just having good wishes, without grasping the primary thing—mobilizing people's enthusiasm—it would be impossible to complete various work tasks well. Therefore, the real rigid targets and rigid tasks are to highlight politics. Politics is the commander, the soul. Whoever leaves it will be like a blind man riding a blind horse, going astray.
    Having learned this lesson, although the subsequent tasks were even more arduous, because we explained to the soldiers the important significance of this project in helping farmers develop agricultural production, and improved the soldiers' consciousness; at the same time, in response to the fear of hardship and fatigue of some soldiers, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant quotations, enhancing their courage to overcome difficulties. Although everyone only worked seven hours a day, the progress rose sharply, with the average amount of earth moved by each person per day increasing from four cubic meters to six cubic meters, and then from six cubic meters to eight cubic meters, finally completing the task smoothly.

    Editor's Note: Of course, you can’t avoid grasping the hoes in production and construction. But hoes are inanimate objects, and they will have different effects when used by different people. Only by grasping "human heads" well can the role of the hoes be greatly enhanced. Comrade Ma Changde's experience vividly illustrates the dialectical relationship between highlighting politics and completing production tasks.

### 先抓“人头”  后抓锄头

    先抓“人头”  后抓锄头
    去年，我们部队担负了一些生产任务，要围垦三千多亩水稻田。头一仗，要在四十天内筑一条高三米六、底宽十九米的大堤，加上内圩工程，总计十三万多土方。以我们连的人力来说，每人平均将近二百方。当时正值数九寒天，冰天雪地，有的战士产生了怕苦、畏难的思想。有的同志提醒我，先抓“人头”，后抓锄头，工程进度才有保证。可是，我当时满脑袋装的是土方石方、进度质量，心想，修水利是硬指标，误了季节，一年任务就要落空，非突击不可；至于政治思想工作，今天不做，明天还可以做。于是我拼命在时间上打主意，天不亮透就动员大家上工，兄弟单位收工了，我们还在干。不料，进度还是赶不上兄弟连队，平均每人每日只完成四方多。
    带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席的有关著作和军委、林彪同志的指示，这才开始清醒过来，搞清了政治和各项工作的关系，才明白光有良好的愿望，不抓第一位的东西——调动人的积极性，就不可能很好地完成各项工作任务。因此，真正的硬指标、硬任务是突出政治。政治是统帅，是灵魂，谁离开了它，就会象盲人骑瞎马，走到邪路上去。
    接受了这个教训，以后的任务虽然更加艰巨，但是由于向战士讲明了这项工程对帮助农民发展农业生产的重要意义，提高了战士的自觉性；同时针对某些战士怕苦怕累的思想，组织大家学习了毛主席的有关语录，增强了战胜困难的勇气。大家每天虽然只干七小时，进度却直线上升，平均每人每日挑土由四方到六方，又由六方到八方，终于顺利地完成了任务。马长德
    编者注：搞生产建设，当然不能不抓锄头。但锄头是死的，不同的人使用它，会发生不同的作用。只有抓好了“人头”，锄头的作用才能大大提高。马长德同志的体会，生动地说明突出政治同完成生产任务之间的辩证关系。
