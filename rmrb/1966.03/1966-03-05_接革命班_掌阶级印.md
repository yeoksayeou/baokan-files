    Editor's Note: Comrade Lü Yulan's speech is a paean to Mao Zedong Thought. We are pleased to see that under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, a new generation in our country has grown up in struggle, "taking over the revolutionary mantle and holding the seal of class."
    Lü Yulan, a young woman who graduated from elementary school, became the head of a primary agricultural production cooperative at the age of fifteen and the Party branch secretary of a production brigade at the age of nineteen. Her work has always been active and outstanding. In the era of Mao Zedong, our country has truly seen the emergence of so many outstanding talents.
    The road is made by people. On the road of advancement, Lü Yulan encountered the rampant attacks of class enemies, the serious difficulties of small-scale production habits, and the heavy pressure of harsh natural conditions... For a teenager, these were all difficult to overcome. However, Lü Yulan resisted and won. When she encountered problems, she asked the Party for instructions and obtained the Party's leadership; she sought advice from poor and lower-middle peasants and obtained their support. In this way, she felt that there was no problem that could not be solved and no difficulty that could not be overcome.
    What force enabled her to rely closely on the Party and the masses at "both ends," and gradually shift from unconsciously relying on them to consciously relying on them? It is Mao Zedong Thought. For more than a decade, she has honestly studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works and honestly acted in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings. Her experience in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is very rich, and the most important thing, we believe, is the word "honest." It seems that whoever is more honest in this regard will make faster progress.

    Taking Over the Revolutionary Mantle and Holding the Seal of Class
    A Report (Abstract) on the Creative Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works by Lü Yulan, Party Branch Secretary of Dongliusangu Brigade, Zhangsanzhai Commune, Linxi County, Hebei Province.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th – For ten years, Lü Yulan, the Party branch secretary of Dongliusangu Brigade, Zhangsanzhai Commune, Linxi County, Hebei Province, has led Party members in relying on poor and lower-middle peasants to overcome one difficulty after another in class struggle and production struggle, continuously consolidating and strengthening the collective economy, and greatly changing the face of production. People asked her where the strength for her tenacious struggle came from. She replied, "Of all the things, the first thing is to study Chairman Mao's works. As long as Chairman Mao's words flash in your mind at all times, you will have courage and strength."
    Now, Dongliusangu, where Lü Yulan is located, has been transformed from a bitter place where "even immortals won't come down, and it's useless to work yourself to death" into a good place where "the sand river doesn't fly sand, and good crops grow on the sandy beach." In 1965, for the first time, it achieved self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus, and also had a bumper harvest of cotton.
    Lü Yulan is twenty-six years old this year. Because she has always insisted on taking the socialist road and loves the collective, she has been supported by many poor and lower-middle peasants and Party members. At the age of fifteen, she was elected as the head of the primary agricultural production cooperative, and at the age of nineteen, she was elected as the Party branch secretary. She has participated in the Provincial Model Worker Conference several times, and also won the honorary title of National "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetter, and was also elected as a member of the County People's Committee. In January of this year, she attended the Hebei Provincial Conference of Activists in Studying Chairman Mao's Works, and recently participated in the Hebei Provincial Congress of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, where she made a report entitled "Taking Over the Revolutionary Mantle and Holding the Seal of Class."
    The following is an abstract of her speech.
    Work is Struggle; Revolution Cannot Be Afraid of Offending People
    In 1955, after graduating from elementary school, I returned to our village, Dongliusangu, with the ideal of building a new socialist countryside, and participated in agricultural production. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and determined to learn from Xu Jianchun, a Shandong educated youth who returned to the countryside. I had a lot of enthusiasm and participated in both light and heavy work. Not long after returning home, the mutual aid group was transformed into an agricultural cooperative, and I was very happy. I went from house to house to connect and organized a small cooperative of twenty-four households. Then I went to the county to attend a meeting and study Chairman Mao's article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and received a great education. Soon after, I became the head of the cooperative. However, some people in the Party branch looked down on me, and my parents were afraid that I would offend people and also complained about me. When I encountered some difficulties in my work, I wrote to the district asking to quit. They wrote back encouraging me, saying, "You are a youth of the Mao Zedong era. This is revolution. Difficulties are just the beginning, and you will encounter even greater difficulties in the future." They also told me to work hard to transform backward people and backward families into advanced ones. Later, I went to the province (Shandong Province; Dongliusangu was originally under the jurisdiction of Shandong) to attend a meeting and saw Xu Jianchun. Xu Jianchun said that she had also encountered some difficulties like mine. The leaders also said that whether or not you offend people depends on what it is and who it is against. Fighting against class enemies and against erroneous ideas is not considered offending people; it is what we should do. Only then did I realize that every village has struggles, that doing work requires fighting against class enemies and fighting against erroneous ideas, and that doing revolution cannot be afraid of offending people. Thinking of this, my enthusiasm grew.
    The women in our village did not have the habit of working in the fields, so I went from door to door to mobilize them. Lü Tianlan's family had just married a daughter-in-law, and the father-in-law wouldn't let her go to the fields. I went to call on them, but they slammed the door in my face. So, I took my shoe sole and pretended to learn how to sew, sitting on the kang in Lü Tianlan's house. When her father-in-law was there, I would do needlework; when her father-in-law was not at home, I would whisper, "Women can only be completely liberated by participating in field labor. It's so good that men and women are members of the cooperative." She said, "I want to go, but my family won't let me." I said, "If you want to go, run out when the gathering is called. In the crowd, your father-in-law won't pull you back." Her thinking was cleared, and she took the initiative to go, and slowly persuaded the family.
    The more you are afraid of something happening, the more likely it is to happen; the more you are afraid of offending people, the more people you offend. I was not afraid anymore; I didn't yield. Whoever's thinking was not cleared, I would do their work; whoever did well, I would praise them; if I was wrong, I would let everyone criticize me. I managed things democratically. With this, fewer people resented me, and everyone's hearts were aligned. However, some people with serious capitalist ideas were very dissatisfied with me. In particular, the class enemies hated me to the core. I thought, let them hate me. The more they hate me, the more it proves that I am doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and the more it proves that our path is the right one. That year, there were ten primary agricultural production cooperatives in our village, and ours was the most united, with the most women participating in work. Others called us "Iron Ball, Iron Ball," saying that our cooperative had many people with aligned hearts, united like an iron ball, not afraid of wind or rain. So, we simply named ourselves the "Iron Ball Cooperative."
    Listen to Chairman Mao's Words; Walk the Socialist Road

    In 1956, during the advanced cooperation movement, five villages in our area joined together to form an advanced agricultural production cooperative, and I served as the deputy director. Dongliusangu was a famous poor sandy nest. In the past, there was a saying: "The sandy river land cannot support a family. You're not afraid of planting, just afraid of the wind. Even immortals won't come down, and it's useless to work yourself to death." How to change this impoverished situation? I pondered while eating, I thought while walking, and I asked everyone I met. Some people said, "Fate is determined by heaven. Treating sand is not easier than treating a headache or fever." I consulted with old poor peasant Lü Tianquan and old Party member Lü Tingwei. They said: Since ancient times, our Dongliusangu has had two scourges: landlords and sandy wastes. Now that the landlords have been overthrown, the sandy wastes are still preventing us from turning over. Now we have the leadership of the Party and organized cooperative members. Whether we do well or not depends entirely on us. They also said that to control the sand, we must plant trees.
    At that time, there were no tree seedlings, and no money to buy them. So, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and carried forward the "poor stick" spirit, collecting seeds and cultivating seedlings ourselves. What kind of seedlings to cultivate? Old poor peasant Lü Tingwei said: "Elm seeds can sprout after they mature." Lü Tingwei served as our advisor, and I organized nine young women to collect elm seeds every day. At that time, some people said: "You want to collect elm seeds to cultivate seedlings? A blind man lighting a lamp—it's a waste of wax." "Look at you group of yellow-haired girls, climbing trees and walls, wanting to become spirits!" We resisted these evil winds and continued to collect. That spring, we collected a full bin of elm seeds. Cultivating seedlings requires land. Although I was the deputy director at that time, I couldn't make big decisions. I asked the production team for land, and only got six mu of poor land after much begging, and they stipulated two conditions: one was to compensate for the loss if it didn't go well; the second was not to record work points. We went all out; we had to do well even if we didn't get work points. We still went to work during regular hours, without resting at noon, and quickly planted four mu of elm trees and inserted two mu of poplar branches. After six or seven days, the lush small seedlings sprouted.
    In the fall, when the seedlings grew to more than one and a half meters, I organized more than forty women to start winter afforestation. Every morning, we got up, took two wotou, carried the seedlings on our backs, and went to the sandy beach six or seven li away to plant trees, and came back in the evening. Sometimes, the wind blew so hard that we couldn't open our eyes. After a few days, our eyes were red and swollen, and our hands were chapped. Some people called us "red-eyed old monkeys," saying that we had become "earth grandmothers." Some people secretly called me silly Yulan, and some even went to my house, patted my shoulder, and said: "Yulan, you have no older brothers above you and no younger brothers below you, and you are a girl. In a few years, I don't know which village you will marry into. Who are you working for!" I said, "Bethune ran more than ten thousand li to China. Who was he doing it for!" Old poor peasant Lü Tingwei said to us: "Afforestation can not only prevent wind and fix sand, but it is also useful for fighting!" He told us, "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, this place used to be a forest, which sheltered many comrades. Later, the devils became furious and destroyed the forest." When we heard that planting trees was also useful for fighting, we decided to build the forest. In this way, every spring we collected seeds and cultivated seedlings, and in winter we afforested. By 1959, we had planted more than 600 mu of trees, a total of more than 110,000 trees. Some grew to the thickness of bowls, a green expanse. In the winter of 1959, the county held a forestry and animal husbandry observation meeting in our village. When the Party branch was re-elected that year, I was elected as the branch secretary.
    Stand Firm, Defend the Socialist Position

    To make revolution and build a new socialist countryside, we must not be afraid of taking risks. In this regard, many revolutionary martyrs have set a brilliant example for us. Whenever I encounter difficulties, I think of Chairman Mao's teachings; whenever I encounter risks, I compare myself with the revolutionary martyrs' spirit of daring to struggle and not fearing bloodshed and sacrifice. With such strict demands, I cast aside the word "I"; once I cast aside the word "I," the fearless spirit came up.
    After taking on the heavy responsibility of branch secretary, I wholeheartedly wanted to do a good job in the collective. If anyone violated policies and took the capitalist road, I wouldn't do it. Some individuals had serious capitalist ideas. I stopped them and educated them, but they were dissatisfied with me and opposed me, and even wrote letters to county-level leaders to accuse me.
    In 1960, I led the rectification and commune management in the village. I brought the third volume of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* from the county women's federation, and I had just bought the fourth volume myself. When I read these books by Chairman Mao, it was as if I had a sun in my heart, and I was not afraid of anything. I thought of what Chairman Mao taught in "Serving the People," that because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing and pointing out shortcomings. I made up my mind that this time, no matter what, I would resolutely act according to the county Party committee's instructions. If I had shortcomings or mistakes, I would first examine myself and resolutely correct them; I would resolutely fight against things that were not conducive to socialism and would never be ambiguous.
    At the rectification meeting, the person who opposed me wanted to bring me down. At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching in "Methods of Work of Party Committees," he said: "We must never forget to draw a clear line of demarcation between these two categories of things: first, between revolution and counterrevolution; second, between achievements and shortcomings. Bearing these two categories of things in mind, things will be easy to handle; otherwise, one will confuse the nature of the problem." Some of the opinions raised by the masses were indeed very good and helpful for future work; some of the groundless things that were raised were obviously slanders. For correct opinions, we must seriously examine and improve; for malicious attacks, we don't have to rush to explain or refute. We should do what we should do. Thinking of these things, I gained strength and courage.
    At night, I reread "On Chongqing Negotiations" and the sentence "What is work? Work is struggle" was especially cordial. I felt that I had never understood it so deeply as at this time. Looking back on these years, working means struggle, and today I am facing a serious struggle again. Chairman Mao, how right you are! Aren't you saying this to me? I know that it is not just me who is being fought, but the socialist road that I am defending. The people who are fighting me don't want to do anything to me, but they want to take the capitalist road freely. I am a Communist Party member and I must withstand the test and fight resolutely to the end. I was thinking alone in the room, it was past midnight, when I heard someone knocking on the door outside and shouting: "Yulan." I said: "Who is it?" "It's me, open the door!" Hearing a familiar voice, I opened the door, and old poor peasants Lü Tingwei, Sun Zhenxiang, Lü Shizhou, Yang Chongxing, Feng Siqing and six or seven others all came in. They said: "Don't listen to the nonsense at the meeting. You must think clearly and don't cry." I said: "I won't cry, I won't shed a tear. Liu Hulan was heroic and unyielding under the enemy's guillotine. What is my matter!" We will see each other in production, don't worry, go to rest!" They left the house, but actually did not leave, fearing that something would happen to me, and were protecting me in secret. I knew that the poor and lower-middle peasants who were truly determined to take the socialist road were on my side, and I was even more encouraged to fight. Later, the prefectural and county Party committees sent people to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, mobilized the masses, exposed and struggled against the criminals who had infiltrated the ranks of cadres, and dealt with them according to their respective circumstances. This educated and improved the masses, and also strengthened me.
    Uniting with comrades with the feelings of class brothers, the struggle is still continuing. The person who opposed me did not dare to show his face, but secretly provoked Ni Xiuli, a disabled soldier who had a low level of awareness at the time and had the burden of being a meritorious person. He said something like: "Of the twenty-eight Party members in the village, who is not longer than her in terms of years of work and Party age? You, a meritorious disabled soldier, also have to turn around under a woman's mouth." Ni Xiuli, who was straight-minded, irritable, and ignited at the slightest spark, quarreled with me when he heard these words.
    What should be done about Ni Xiuli's behavior? I took this question and looked for answers in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of Communists towards backward people is not to despise them or look down on them, but to be close to them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." He also said that it is necessary to "pay attention to uniting those comrades who have different opinions from their own to work together." He opposed me because he did not yet understand me and had been instigated by others. When he came to his senses, he would work with me. Besides, it takes two hands to clap, so we can't put all the blame on him. We should follow what Chairman Mao said and muster up the courage to unite him. I took the initiative to talk to him, but he refused. I talked to him many times, but he ignored me. A group of women couldn't stand it anymore. Some said: "Yulan, why are you so spineless, talking to him so humbly." Some advised me: "Why do you have to unite him!" I said: "A revolutionary should put the interests of the revolution first, the interests of the class first, have a broad mind, not hold grudges against his comrades, and should unite them and work with them." I still took the initiative to approach him and unite him. Whenever it rained, I would wade through the water to see if his house was leaking, whether he had firewood to burn, and whether he was short of rice and noodles. During the New Year and holidays, I would ask him about his health and warmth. When I went to the district for a meeting, I felt sorry that his disabled leg, which had shed blood for the revolution, was cold, so I gave him the quilt to cover. One winter, after a heavy snowfall, I went to sweep his house and courtyard before he got up. Once, I was sweeping the snow for him when he opened the door and said: "It's very cold, don't sweep it, sit inside!" I was overjoyed and thought, you finally said something! Later, I would take the initiative to ask for his opinions on any work. Over time, Ni Xiuli changed. One day, he took the initiative to come to my house to talk to me. I first said: "Xiuli brother, we are both Communist Party members, and Communist Party members should carry out criticism and self-criticism from the Party's standpoint. You are a revolutionary disabled soldier, you have shed blood for the revolution, and you are an old Party member. In the past, I did not care enough about you and did not learn enough from you. This is my fault, but you also have a shortcoming: you don't criticize problems within the Party. If there are any places where I don't do well, please point them out and criticize me severely." Xiuli lowered his head sadly and said: I used to listen to others and disagree with you. In the future, please remind me more if anything happens, and let's do revolution together. Seeing that Ni Xiuli had really changed his mind, I took out Chairman Mao's works to study with him whenever I had time, reading "Serving the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Combat Liberalism" to him word by word. The more he learned, the brighter his mind became, and his awareness improved. Later, he was very enthusiastic about his work. In 1965, he was elected as a member of the Party branch committee and became my strong assistant. Some other comrades who had ideological knots with me or had misunderstandings and quarreled with me for a while, I brought them all back, so that more people were united around the Party branch and worked with me. This greatly enhanced the Party branch's combat effectiveness.

    Strengthen Core Leadership, Rely on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cultivate Backbone Forces

    Because I was young, shouldering the heavy responsibility of Party branch secretary, I had high enthusiasm but few methods. At first, I didn't know how to be a "squad leader," and like a child, I only knew how to "blow the whistle" but didn't know how to "play the piano." In my work, I didn't follow the mass line, didn't know how to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants in everything, only believed in myself, didn't believe in others, and was simple and rigid. I took care of everything, big and small, and was busy all day long. As a result of my doing this, the other branch committee members had opinions about me, and their work slowly became passive, and they pushed everything onto me.
    I did the work myself, suffered the hard work, and still made everyone unhappy. For a time, I couldn't understand it. Afterwards, I reflected this problem to the district Party committee secretary, and he helped me analyze the problems in my work. After returning to the village, I studied repeatedly, took the initiative to examine my shortcomings of not relying on the masses enough, and took on the responsibilities that I should have taken on. When I examined myself, the other branch committee members also examined their own shortcomings. Then we studied ways to improve, emphasizing political and ideological work, extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, doing a good job in the ideological work of cadres and members, and implementing political and ideological work on the five fronts of grain, cotton, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. The branch committee members divided up the work, discussed major matters collectively, made resolutions, and went to grasp them separately. In this way, the work went smoothly, everyone's enthusiasm was brought into play, and it was rhythmic like "playing the piano." From this period of practice, I realized that: a person is made of iron, but can only twist a few nails; a single piece of wood cannot support the sky; a branch secretary, like Chairman Mao taught, must be good at being a "squad leader," unite cadres, and give play to the role of the organization. Only by relying on the strength of everyone can we do the work well.
    In recent years, the appearance of our village has undergone great changes. These changes are the result of hard work under the correct leadership of the Party and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants. My understanding of the role of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and my reliance on the poor and lower-middle peasants, have gone through a process from unconsciousness to relative consciousness. When I first became the branch secretary, I implemented the Party's policies and resolutely took the socialist road. Although the method was simple, some people supported me, but at that time, I only thought that these people were good, and I didn't see their class essence. One day, I read Chairman Mao's *Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan*, which said: "The main force that has been bitterly fighting in the countryside has always been the poor peasants. From the secret period to the public period, the poor peasants have been actively fighting there. They listen to the leadership of the Communist Party the most." This reminded me, and I looked at the booklet that divided the components during the land reform, and it turned out that most of the people who supported me in taking the socialist road and loved the collective were poor and lower-middle peasants. These people are ideologically advanced, and it is their class essence that is good.
    Seeing that they are the pillars and the objects of reliance, how to rely on them? First, assign tasks. As soon as there is a task, I say: "The poor and lower-middle peasants take the lead and guarantee the completion of the task." Without consultation, without seriously soliciting their opinions, consultation is also just a formality, talking about numbers. Over time, some poor and lower-middle peasants also have opinions. With this question in mind, I repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's theses on the mass line. Chairman Mao said: "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at making every movement and every struggle of ours understood and mastered not only by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership. The boundary of whether our work makes mistakes is also here." Chairman Mao's words made my heart as bright as if two doors had been opened. Right! We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and improve our work. Later, I would consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants about everything. They have rich experience, many methods, and high enthusiasm, and the production tasks are completed very well. From here, I realized that: once the Party's policies are grasped by the masses, they understand what they are doing is for, and there will be a leap from spirit to matter. The responsibility of the cadres is to hand over the Party's policies to the masses and make them understand the truth that farming is for revolution.

    To make the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants last, we must also care about their lives. As Chairman Mao said, care about the pain of the masses, sincerely and truly serve the masses, solve the problems of production and life of the masses, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, the problem of childbirth, and solve all the problems of the masses. If we do this, the masses will support us and regard revolution as their supreme glory. Hua Yuelin, the feeder of the twelfth team, scalded his chest when he was decocting medicine for a sick cow. The brigade paid for him to buy medicine, and I and several branch committee members went to see him every day, asked a doctor for him, and helped him decoct the medicine. He said with deep emotion: "I came to Dongliusangu from Henan to escape the famine in the old society. Although I am a foreigner, everyone did not treat me as an outsider. Today I was injured for the collective, and everyone cares about me so much. I will definitely make greater efforts for the collective in the future and feed the livestock well." From then on, Hua Yuelin was more enthusiastic about the collective. One winter, the newborn calf could not get milk, was weak and afraid of the cold, so he took off his new cotton coat and covered the calf. At that time, his wife was still in confinement. In order to get the cow to produce milk earlier, he cooked porridge in a pot for more than half a pot. One day, his wife asked him: "Why do you cook the porridge so thin?" He replied: "I am serving two months of confinement!" "How many months of confinement are there?" his wife asked in surprise. He smiled and said: "There is also the calf's mother!" In this way, he patiently raised the cow and took care of the calf for seven days and nights until the cow produced milk.
    Lü Xiaobao, the accountant of the eighth team in our village, is an orphan. In the past, because no one took care of him at home, he developed bad habits of not knowing how to be thrifty, eating well and being lazy. He spent money lavishly when he had it, so that he couldn't wear cotton clothes in winter. When he was in the most difficult situation, I took him to live in my own home, took apart and washed his cotton clothes, made cotton shoes, first bought him picture books to read, and then guided him to study Chairman Mao's works. After more than ten months of patient help in my home, he gradually raised his class consciousness, worked actively, and became more concerned about collective affairs. In 1964, he used the money he saved to buy a hair clipper to give haircuts to the members of the whole village. The masses called him a "volunteer barber." In the winter of 1965, he gloriously joined the Communist Youth League and was also rated as a "five-good" member.
    From these two incidents of Hua Yuelin and Lü Xiaobao, I deeply felt that: the more we care about the lives of the masses, the greater the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will be. From then on, our brigade Party branch, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, put the issue of caring about the lives of the masses on the agenda, discussed it regularly, and focused on it once every year and festival. We regularly educated cadres and Party members to regard caring about the lives of the masses as an important task in their work. Cadres and Party members were assigned to be responsible for the family members of revolutionary martyrs, the family members of soldiers, the family members of cadres, the family members of workers, and the poor and lower-middle peasant households in difficulty. These households basically achieved that someone carried water, someone took care of them when they were sick, someone helped repair the house when it was damaged, and someone visited them during the New Year and festivals. In this way, the core combat effectiveness of our village Party branch was strengthened, and a group of revolutionary backbones and a group of activists were united around the core. Whatever we did, from within the Party to outside the Party, from the poor and lower-middle peasants to the broad masses, it would be pushed open all at once.

### 接革命班　掌阶级印

专栏：

    编者按：吕玉兰同志这篇讲话，是一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。我们高兴地看到，在毛泽东思想哺育下，我国一代新人，已经在斗争中成长起来，“接革命班掌阶级印”了。
    吕玉兰，这个高小毕业的女青年，十五岁担任初级农业生产合作社社长，十九岁担任生产大队党支部书记，工作一贯积极、出色。在毛泽东时代，我们国家硬是涌现了这么多这么优秀的人材。
    路是人走出来的。吕玉兰在前进道路上，遇到的是阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，小生产习惯势力的严重困扰，恶劣自然条件的重压……对一个十几岁的青年来说，这都是些不容易克服的困难。可是，吕玉兰抗住了，胜利了。遇到问题，她就向党请示，取得党的领导；向贫农下中农求教，取得贫农下中农的支持，这样，她就觉得没有什么问题不能解决，没有什么困难不能克服。
    是什么力量使她紧紧依靠党和群众这“两头”，并且逐步由不自觉地依靠到自觉地依靠呢？是毛泽东思想。十几年来，她老老实实地学习毛泽东同志的著作，老老实实地按照毛泽东同志的教导办事。她活学活用毛泽东思想的经验很丰富，最重要的一条，我们认为就是“老实”二字。看来谁在这方面老实些，谁的进步就会快些。
    接革命班　掌阶级印
    河北省临西县张三寨公社东留善固大队党支部书记吕玉兰活学活用毛主席著作的报告（摘要）
    新华社天津四日电　河北省临西县张三寨公社东留善固大队党支部书记吕玉兰，十年来带领党员依靠贫农下中农，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中战胜一个又一个困难，使集体经济不断巩固壮大，生产面貌发生了很大变化。人们问她那股顽强斗争的力量是从哪里来的？她回答说：“千条万条，学习毛主席著作是第一条，只要脑子里时时闪耀着毛主席的话，就有胆略，就有力量。”
    现在，吕玉兰所在的东留善固，由一个“神仙不下界，累死也白搭”的苦地方，变成了“沙河不飞沙，沙滩上长出了好庄稼”的好地方，一九六五年第一次做到了粮食自给有余，棉花也获得丰收。
    吕玉兰今年二十六岁，由于一贯坚持走社会主义道路，热爱集体，得到许多贫农下中农和党员们的拥护和支持，十五岁时就被选为初级农业生产合作社社长，十九岁被选为党支部书记。她曾经几次参加省劳模会，又获得了全国“三八”红旗手的光荣称号，还当选了县人民委员会委员。今年一月，她出席了河北省学习毛主席著作积极分子会议，最近又参加了河北省贫农下中农代表大会，并在会上作了题为“接革命班掌阶级印”的报告。
    下面是她的发言摘要。
    工作就是斗争，革命不能怕得罪人
    一九五五年我在高小毕业后，就抱着建设社会主义新农村的理想，回到了我们村——东留善固，参加农业生产。那时候，我才十五岁，决心学习山东省回乡知识青年徐建春，浑身一股子热劲，不论轻活重活都参加。回家不久，互助组转为农业社，我心里可高兴啦，一户户串连，组织起了一个二十四户的小社。接着到县里开会，学习毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》的文章，受到了很大的教育。不久以后，我当了社长。可是，党支部里却有人瞧不起我，爹娘怕我得罪人，也埋怨我，工作中遇到一些困难，我就给区里写信，要求不干了。他们来信鼓励我说：“你是毛泽东时代的青年，革命哩，困难仅仅是开始，以后还会遇到更大的困难。”他们还叫我努力把落后的人、落后的家庭，改变成先进的。以后我到省里（山东省，东留善固原属山东管辖）开会，看见徐建春，徐建春说她也遇到了我那样一些困难。领导上也说，得罪人不得罪人，要看是什么事，对什么人。跟阶级敌人斗，跟错误思想斗，不算得罪人，是我们应该做的。我这才明白哪村也有斗争，干工作就得和阶级敌人斗争，和错误思想斗争，干革命就不能怕得罪人。想到这，我的劲头大了。
    我们村的妇女没有下地干活的习惯，我就挨门挨户去动员。吕天兰家新娶了儿媳妇，老公公不让她下地，去叫吧，人家插上门。我就拿着鞋底子，装着跟人家学做活，坐在吕天兰家炕头上，她老公公在的时候，就做针线活，她老公公不在家，就小声说：“妇女只有参加田间劳动，才能彻底解放。男女一样当社员，你说多么好。”她说：“我愿意去，家里不让去。”我说：“你愿去，集合的时候，一下跑出去，在人群里，你老公公不会拉回你来。”她思想通了，以后就主动去了，也慢慢地把家庭说服了。
    越怕出事越出事，越怕得罪人越得罪的人多。我不怕了，不迁就了，谁思想不通，就做谁的工作，谁做得对就表扬谁，我不对就让大家批评，民主管事。这一闹，怨我的少了，大家心齐了。但是，有的资本主义思想严重的人对我很不满意。特别是阶级敌人，更是恨透我了。我想，你们恨吧，你们越恨我，越证明我按照毛主席的指示办了，越证明我们的道路走对了。这一年，我们村有十个初级农业生产合作社，就数我们社心齐，妇女出勤多。别人喊我们“铁球、铁球”，说我们社人多心齐，团结得象铁球一样，不怕风吹雨打。我们就干脆起名叫做“铁球合作社”。
    听话要听毛主席的话，走路要走社会主义路
    一九五六年高级合作化，我们那里五个村联合起来成立一个高级农业生产合作社，我担任副社长。东留善固是有名的穷沙窝，过去流传着这样几句话：“沙河地，不养家，不怕种，就怕刮，神仙不下界，累死也白搭。”怎样改变这穷困的面貌呢？我吃饭琢磨，走路也想，逢人就问。有的人说：“命由天定，治沙不比治头痛脑热的容易。”我找老贫农吕天全和老党员吕廷伟商量。他们说：自古以来，咱东留善固有两害，一是地主，二是沙荒。如今地主被打倒了，沙荒还压着咱们翻不了身。现在有党的领导，有组织起来的社员，搞好搞不好，全看咱们的了。他们还说，要治沙就得造林。
    当时没有树苗，又没有钱买。我们就按照毛主席的教导，发扬“穷棒子”精神，自己采种，自己育苗。育什么苗？老贫农吕廷伟说：“榆树籽成熟以后可以出苗。”吕廷伟给我们当参谋，我组织九名青年妇女每天采榆树种。那时候有人说：“你们想采榆树籽育苗啊，瞎子点灯——白费蜡。”“看你们这群黄毛妮子，上树爬墙的，想要成精啊！”我们顶着这些歪风，还是继续采。这年春天，采了满满一囤脚榆树籽。育苗，需要地。我那时候虽然是副社长，但做不了大主，向生产队要地，好说歹说才给了六亩赖地，还订了两个条件：一是搞不好如数赔产；二是不给记工分。我们豁出去了，不给工分也得搞好，正时正晌照样出工，中午不休息，很快种上了四亩榆树，插了二亩杨树条，过了六、七天，青葱葱的小树苗都出土了。
    到了秋后，小树苗长到一米半以上，我又组织了四十多名妇女开始冬季造林。每天早晨起来，我们带上两个窝窝头，背上树苗子，到六、七里地以外的沙滩上造林，晚上才回来。有时候刮起风来睁不开眼，干了几天，眼被打红了，手冻裂了，有人叫我们“红眼老马猴”，说我们变成“土奶奶”啦。有些人背地里叫我傻玉兰，还有人找到我家去，拍着我的肩膀说：“玉兰哪，你上边没有哥哥，下边没有弟弟，又是个闺女，过几年还不知嫁到那村去，你给谁打乾坤哪！”我说：“白求恩跑一万多里到中国来，他为了谁呀！”老贫农吕廷伟对我们说：“造林不但能防风固沙，打仗还有用呢？”他告诉我们，“抗日战争时候，这里曾经是一片树林，掩护过很多同志，以后鬼子发狠，就把这片林子破坏了。”我们听说植树造林打仗还有用，就决心要把林子造起来。就这样，每年春天采种育苗，冬天造林，到了一九五九年，植树六百多亩，共十一万多棵。有的长到碗口粗，绿油油的一片。一九五九年冬天，县里在我们村开了林业、畜牧观摩会。这年党支部改选时，我当选为支部书记。
    站稳立场，坚持社会主义阵地
    要干革命，要建设社会主义新农村，就不能怕冒风险。在这方面很多革命先烈给我们树立了光辉的榜样。我遇到什么困难，就想想毛主席的教导：遇到什么风险，就用革命先烈的敢于斗争、不怕流血牺牲的精神，和自己比一比。这样一严格要求，就把“我”字丢开了；一丢开“我”字，不怕鬼的楞劲就上来了。
    我担上支部书记这个重担子以后，一心想把集体搞好，谁违犯政策走资本主义道路，我就不干。有个别人资本主义思想严重，我制止他，教育他，他却不满意我，跟我作对，甚至写信到县级领导去告我。
    一九六○年，我在村里领导整风整社，从县妇联拿来了《毛泽东选集》第三卷，自己又刚买了第四卷。我读了毛主席的这些书，就象心里有了太阳，什么也不怕。我想到毛主席在《为人民服务》里教导的，因为我们是为人民服务的，所以有缺点就不怕别人批评指出。我打定主意，这次整风，不管怎么样，坚决按县委指示办，自己有缺点、错误，先检查，坚决改正；对于不利于社会主义的事就坚决斗争，决不含糊。
    在整风会上，跟我作对的人想把我斗倒。这时候，我想起毛主席在《党委会的工作方法》中的教导，他说：“我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。记着这两条界限，事情就好办，否则就会把问题的性质弄混淆了。”群众提的意见，有的确实很好，对今后工作有帮助；有人提的那些没影的事，很明显是诬蔑。对正确的意见，就要认真检查改进；对恶意的攻击，不一定忙着解释、反驳。该干什么还得干什么。一想起这些，我添了劲，壮了胆。
    晚上，我再看《关于重庆谈判》，看到“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”这句话，格外亲切，觉得从来没有象这时领会得深刻。回想这些年，一干就是斗争，今天又面临一场严重斗争。毛主席呀，你说的多么对，你这不是冲着俺说的吗？我知道斗的不是我一个人，是斗的我坚持的社会主义道路。斗我的人不是想把我斗得怎么样，是想自自在在地走资本主义道路。我是共产党员，一定要经得起考验，坚决斗争到底。我在屋里一个人想，多半夜了，听到外面“砰”“砰”敲门，喊：“玉兰。”我说：“谁呀？”“俺，开门吧！”听着是熟人的声音，一开门，老贫农吕廷伟、孙振祥、吕世周、杨崇兴、冯四清等六七个人全进来了。他们说：“会上的胡言乱语，你别听，一定要想开点，别哭。”我说：“我不哭，一滴眼泪也不掉，刘胡兰在敌人铡刀下英勇不屈，我这点事算什么！咱们生产上见，你们放心吧，都休息去吧！”他们出屋了，实际上都没有走，怕我出事，在暗中保护着我。我知道真正坚决走社会主义道路的贫农下中农，是站在我这一边的，更加鼓起了斗争勇气。后来，地委、县委派人来，依靠贫农下中农，发动群众，对钻进干部队伍的犯罪分子进行了揭发斗争，并分别情况作了处理。这样就教育提高了群众，更锻炼了我自己。
    以阶级兄弟的感情团结同志斗争还在继续着。和我作对的人不敢出头露面了，却在暗地里挑拨当时觉悟不高、背着功臣包袱的残废军人倪修礼。说什么：“全村二十八名党员，论工作年头，论党龄，谁不比她长，你这有功的残废军人，也得在女人的嘴巴子底下转。”心眼直，脾气暴躁，一点火就着的倪修礼，听了这些话和我闹起别扭来。
    对待倪修礼这种行为该怎么办？我带着这个问题，从毛主席著作中找答案。毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”还说，要“注意团结那些和自己意见不同的同志一道工作。”他反对我，是因为他还不了解我，又受了别人挑唆。当他省悟过来的时候，是会和我一道工作的。再说，一个巴掌拍不响，不能把责任都推到他身上。应该照毛主席说的那样，鼓起勇气去团结他。我主动找他谈心，他拒绝，好多次跟他说话，他不理。一群妇女看不过去，有的说：“玉兰，干啥那么没骨气，低三下四地找他说话。”有的劝我：“干啥非团结他不行！”我说：“一个革命者，就应该以革命利益为重，以阶级利益为重，心胸开阔，对自己的同志不能记仇，应该团结他们，同自己一道工作。”我还是主动地接近他，团结他。每逢下雨，我要趟着水去看一看他的房子漏不漏，有没有柴烧，缺不缺米面。过年过节，我去问寒问暖。到区里开会，我心痛他那条为革命流过血的残废腿受凉，把被子让给他盖。冬天下了大雪，不等他起床，我就去给他扫房扫院子。一次，我正给他扫雪，他开门一看说：“天怪冷，别扫啦，屋里坐吧！”我喜得了不得，心里想，你可算说了句话！以后，有什么工作，我就主动找他征求意见。时间长了，倪修礼变了。一天，他主动来我家，找我谈心。我首先说：“修礼哥，我们都是共产党员，共产党员应该站在党的立场上开展批评与自我批评。你是革命残废军人，为革命流过血，又是老党员，过去我对你关心不够，向你学习不够，这是我的不对，可是你也有一个缺点，有问题不在党内批评。我那些地方做得不对，你尽管提出来，狠狠地批评吧。”修礼伤心地低着头说：以前我听了别人的话，跟你过不去，今后有啥事多提醒我，咱们一同干革命。我看倪修礼真的回心转意了，得空就拿上毛主席著作跟他一起学习，把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《反对自由主义》一字一句念给他听。他越学心里越亮，觉悟提高了，以后对工作非常热情。一九六五年他被选为党支部委员，成了我的有力助手。其他有些和我结了思想疙瘩，或者发生了误会，一时和我闹别扭的同志，我都一一把他们争取过来，使更多的人团结到党支部周围，和我一道工作了，这样就大大增强了党支部的战斗力。
  加强核心领导，依靠贫下中农，培养骨干力量
    由于我年纪小，担起党支部书记这个重担子，热情高，办法少。开始不知道怎样当“班长”，象小孩一样，只会“吹哨”，不会“弹钢琴”。在工作当中，也不会走群众路线，不懂得事事依靠贫农下中农，只相信自己，不相信别人，简单生硬，大事小事我全包揽，整天忙得脚不沾地。我这样干的结果，反倒惹得其他支委对我有意见，他们的工作慢慢消极了，什么事情都往我身上推。
    自己做了工作，受了累，还惹得大家不高兴，一时理解不了。事后，我把这个问题反映给区委书记，他帮助我分析了工作中存在的问题。回村后，我反复学习，主动检查了依靠群众不够的缺点，把应该承担的责任，承担下来。我一检查，别的支委也检查起自己的缺点来。然后我们研究了改进办法，强调政治思想工作，大学毛主席著作，做好干部、社员的思想工作，并把政治思想工作落实在粮、棉、林、牧、副五条战线上去。支委作了分工，重大事项，集体研究，做出决议，分头去抓。这样一来，工作顺手了，大家的积极性发挥出来了，象“弹钢琴”一样，有节奏了。从这一段实践中，使我体会到：一个人浑身是铁，能捻几颗钉，一根木头撑不起天，一个支部书记要象毛主席教导的那样，要善于当“班长”，团结干部，发挥组织的作用。依靠大家的力量，才能把工作做好。
    这几年，俺村的面貌发生了很大的变化，这些变化都是在党的正确领导下，依靠贫农下中农艰苦奋斗的结果。我在认识贫农下中农的作用上，在依靠贫农下中农上，经历了一个从不自觉到比较自觉的过程。刚当支部书记的时候，我执行党的政策，坚决走社会主义道路，虽然方法简单，也有一些人支持我，但是那时我只觉得这些人好，看不到他们的阶级本质。有一天，我读毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，里边说：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。从秘密时期到公开时期，贫农都在那里积极奋斗。他们最听共产党的领导。”这一下提醒了我，找到土改时候划成份的册子一看，原来支持我走社会主义道路，爱护集体的大多数是贫农下中农，这些人思想进步，是他们阶级本质好。
    看到了他们是顶梁柱，是依靠对象，怎样依靠他们？先是交任务，一有了任务就说：“贫农下中农起带头，保证完成任务。”不商量，不认真征求他们的意见，商量也是走过场，讲数字。这样时间长了，有的贫农下中农也有意见。我带着这个问题，反复地翻看了毛主席有关群众路线的论述。毛主席说：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”毛主席的话使我心里象开了两扇门一样那么豁亮。对！一定要按照毛主席的教导，改进工作。以后，有事我就同贫农下中农商量，他们经验丰富，办法多，积极性很高，生产任务完成得很好。从这里，我体会到：党的政策，一旦被群众掌握了，明白了他们要做的工作是为了什么，就会完成一次从精神变物质的飞跃。当干部的责任，就是把党的政策交给群众，使他们懂得种田就是为革命的道理。
    要使广大贫下中农的革命干劲持久下来，还必须关心他们的生活。象毛主席说的那样，关心群众的痛痒，真心真意地为群众办事，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，穿衣的问题，生小孩的问题，解决群众的一切问题。我们这样做了，群众才会拥护我们，把革命当作他们无上光荣的事情。十二队饲养员华岳林给病牛熬药，烫伤了前胸，大队出钱给他买药，我和几个支委天天去看他，给他请医生，帮他煎药。他深受感动地说：“我是旧社会从河南逃荒来到东留善固的，虽说是外乡人，可大家没把我当外人看待，今天我为集体受了伤，大家这样关心我，以后一定要为集体出更大的力，喂好牲口。”从这以后，华岳林为集体更热心啦。一年冬天，刚生下来的小牛犊，接不上奶，体弱怕冷，他就脱下自己的新棉袄给小牛犊盖上。当时，他老婆正坐月子，为了让母牛早点下来奶，他熬粥时一熬就是多半锅。一天，他老婆问他：“为啥把粥熬这么稀？”他回答说：“我一个人侍候两个月子呢！”“那有两个月子？”他老婆惊奇地问。他笑了，说：“还有小牛它娘哩！”就这样，他耐心地饲养母牛，关照着小牛，一连七个昼夜，直到牛下来了奶。
    俺村八队会计吕小宝，是个孤儿，过去因为家中没人照管，养成了不知勤俭，好吃懒做的坏习惯，有了钱就胡花乱花，闹得冬天穿不上棉衣服。在他生活最困难的时候，我把他接到自己家来住，替他拆洗了棉衣，做了棉鞋，先给他买小人书看，以后又引导他学习毛主席著作。经过在我家十个多月的耐心帮助，他逐步提高了阶级觉悟，劳动积极了，对集体的事更关心了。一九六四年，他用自己节省下来的钱买了一把推子，给全村的社员理发，群众称他是“义务理发员”。一九六五年冬，他光荣地参加了共产主义青年团，还被评为“五好”社员。
    从华岳林、吕小宝这两件事中，我深深感到：越是关心群众生活，群众的革命干劲就越大。从此，我们大队党支部，就按照毛主席的指示，把关心群众生活的问题列入议程，定期讨论，逢年过节大抓一次。经常教育干部、党员把关心群众生活作为自己工作中的一项重要任务。对烈属、军属、干部家属、工人家属和贫农下中农困难户，都有干部和党员分工包管，对这些户基本上做到了吃水有人担，病了有人管，房子坏了有人帮助修理，逢年过节有人看。这样一来，俺们村党支部核心战斗力加强了，核心周围，团结起一把子革命骨干，还有一群积极分子，办什么事由党内到党外，由贫农下中农到广大群众，一下就推开了。
