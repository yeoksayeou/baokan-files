    My Rolling Mill
    Chen Yulin, Rolling Mill Worker, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company
    When I go on duty, it also goes on duty; when I roll steel, it also rolls steel. My rolling mill, oh, so full of fighting spirit!
    I use a small hammer to tap its chest, clang, clang!
    I use a wrench to test its arm strength, clank, clank!
    I use calipers to measure its appetite, capable of holding the sea and the ocean!
    Born with a steel and iron frame, born with a heroic courage.
    Pairs of rollers, all fighting on the front lines!
    Specially seeking out the difficult to roll, specially tackling the tough ones!
    I come to my post full of passion, shouting at the rolling mill: "The Third Five-Year Plan has begun, how much steel will you roll to dedicate to the Party?"
    My rolling mill, oh, opening its rumbling throat to sing loudly: "The steel needed for the revolution, leave it to us!"

    我的轧机
    马鞍山钢铁公司轧钢工  陈玉林我上岗，它也上岗；我轧钢，它也轧钢。我的轧机呵，斗志昂扬！用小锤敲敲它的胸膛，当当！用扳手试试它的臂力，铿锵！用卡尺量量它的胃口，装得下大海和大洋！生就一副钢筋铁骨，生就一副英雄胆量。一对对轧辊，都战斗在最前方！专找难的轧，专找硬的上！我满怀激情来上岗，冲着轧机嚷：“第三个五年计划开始啦，你轧多少献给党？”我的轧机呵，扯开隆隆的嗓子高声唱：“革命需要的钢材，包在咱身上！”
