    Leaders of the Thirteenth Construction Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Go Among the Workers, Asking Them to Use Jiao Yulu as a "Standard" to Examine the Leaders' Thoughts and Work, Promoting the Further Revolutionization of the Leaders
  (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st) The *Shanxi Daily* reports that the leading cadres of the Thirteenth Construction Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry brought the article "The Example of a County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu" to the workers to preach, asking the workers to use Jiao Yulu as a "standard" to give opinions to the leaders, and to examine the leaders' work and style.
    The workers and grassroots cadres were deeply moved by the company leaders' conscious revolutionary spirit. They said excitedly: Because we have Chairman Mao, we have good cadres like Jiao Yulu; because we have Chairman Mao, the leaders are so consciously transforming themselves.
    They said: The leaders are determined to learn from Jiao Yulu, and we are determined to learn from the people of Lankao; the leaders are determined to be Daqing-style leaders, and we are determined to be Daqing people; the people of Lankao can subdue the "three scourges" and create a new world, and we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties and create a Daqing-style enterprise. The workers gave opinions to the leading cadres very seriously, helped the leaders sum up their experiences and lessons, and realized revolutionization.
    What the workers and grassroots cadres are most concerned about is how to highlight politics and take Mao Zedong Thought as the commander in the enterprise, especially in the leading core. They believe that whether an enterprise is run well or not depends on whether the books of Chairman Mao are read and used well. "Good or not depends on the leaders." If the leaders truly use Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, highlight politics, the masses will follow, and even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. The employees believe that their company's conditions are no worse than Lankao's or Daqing's, but their work is far from catching up with Lankao and Daqing. The fundamental gap lies in not learning and using Chairman Mao's works as well as they do. Therefore, the first opinion everyone has is to ask the leaders to take the lead in learning Chairman Mao's works well, especially to work hard on the word "use."
    The second opinion is to ask the leaders to highlight politics at all times, highlight politics everywhere, and highlight politics in everything. Some workers said that there are many active thoughts, they have them, and the leaders also have them. The leaders should first grasp their own active thoughts, and also grasp their active thoughts. For example, there are many active thoughts in evaluation and rewards. The workers themselves have to grasp it, and the leaders must grasp it even more.
    The third opinion is to ask the leaders to go deeper into the masses and persist in participating in labor. Some employees said that in the past few years, the leaders shouted a lot from above, but came down less often, and everyone had a lot of opinions. Now that they have come down, they are very welcome. When the leaders come down, they are one step closer to them; when the leaders participate in labor, they are one step closer to them; when the leaders mingle with them, they are heart to heart. They hope that the leaders will get more mud on their bodies, discuss things with everyone, and be workers first, then leaders. Some employees also said that the leaders go deep down, not only to participate in labor, but also to help sum up experience, offer ideas, and find solutions. Some employees also criticized some leading comrades for going down to the lower levels relatively less, relying too much on holding meetings and listening to reports to guide the mass movement.
    The leaders' conscious revolutionary spirit stimulated the masses' enthusiasm to help the leaders rectify their work style; the masses' sincere help further promoted the leaders' progress on the road to revolutionization. They are determined to do revolution for a lifetime like Jiao Yulu, read Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, transform their thinking for a lifetime, and better lead all the company's employees to struggle for the proletarian revolutionary cause for the rest of their lives.

    The two news items published here on learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu are worth reading. These two news items come from the two fronts of workers and peasants, and the methods introduced are not exactly the same, but they all illustrate an important issue: as long as leading cadres consciously make revolution, they can mobilize the broad masses to rise up and make revolution; only when leading cadres make revolution together with the broad masses can the revolution be carried out thoroughly.
    The Linyou County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China did this, and the masses said, "If the county party committee continues to work with us like this, it will not be difficult to change the backward situation." The leading cadres of the Thirteenth Construction Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry did this, and the workers said, "The leaders are determined to learn from Jiao Yulu, and we are determined to learn from the people of Lankao; the people of Lankao can subdue the 'three scourges' and create a new world, and we can also overcome difficulties and create a Daqing-style enterprise."

    领导有决心学习焦裕禄  工人有决心学习兰考人
    冶金工业部第十三建设公司领导干部到工人中去，请工人以焦裕禄为“标尺”，检查领导的思想和工作，促进领导进一步革命化
  据新华社太原一日电《山西日报》报道，冶金工业部第十三建设公司的领导干部带着《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇文章，到工人当中去宣讲，让工人们照着焦裕禄这个“标尺”，给领导提意见，检查领导的工作和作风。
    工人和基层干部们，深为公司领导的这种自觉的革命精神所感动。他们激动地说：有了毛主席，才有焦裕禄这样的好干部；有了毛主席，领导才这样自觉地改造自己。
    他们说：领导有决心学习焦裕禄，我们有决心学习兰考人民；领导有决心当大庆式的领导，我们有决心当大庆人；兰考人民能够制服“三害”创出一个新天地，我们也一定能够克服困难，创出一个大庆式的企业来。工人们十分认真地给领导干部提意见，帮助领导总结经验教训，实现革命化。
    工人和基层干部最关心的是在企业里特别是在领导核心中怎样突出政治以毛泽东思想挂帅。他们认为，企业办得好不好，就看对毛主席的书读得好不好，用得好不好。“好不好，看领导”，领导真正作到了用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，群众就会跟上来，天大的困难也能拿下来。职工们认为，自己公司的条件不比兰考差，不比大庆坏，但是工作远没有赶上兰考和大庆。根本的差距在于没有象人家那样，把毛主席的著作学好用好。因此，大家的第一条意见，就是要求领导带头把毛主席著作学好，特别是要在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    第二条意见是，要求领导时时突出政治，处处突出政治，事事突出政治。有的工人说，活思想多得很，他们有，领导也有。领导首先应当抓自己的活思想，也要抓他们的活思想。比如，在评比、奖励上，活思想就很多。工人自己要抓，领导上更要抓。
    第三条意见是，要求领导更多地深入群众，坚持参加劳动。有的职工说，前几年领导在上边喊的多，下来的少，大伙儿意见很多。现在下来了，他们非常欢迎。领导一下来，就和他们近了一层；领导一参加劳动，就和他们亲了一层；领导和他们打成一片，那就心贴心了。他们希望领导身上多沾点泥土，遇事同大家商量，先当工人，后当领导者。还有的职工说，领导深入下来，不光是为了参加劳动，还要帮助下边总结经验，出主意想办法。还有一些职工，对于有的领导同志深入下层比较少，过多地靠开会、听汇报来指导群众运动，提出了批评。
    领导自觉革命的精神，激发了群众帮助领导整风的积极性；群众实心实意地帮助，又促使领导在革命化的道路上前进了一步。他们下定决心，要象焦裕禄那样干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，更好地领导全公司职工，为无产阶级的革命事业奋斗终生。（附图片）

    这里登载的两条向焦裕禄同志学习的消息，值得一读。这两条消息来自工农两个战线，介绍的方法也不尽一样，但都说明了一个重要问题：只要领导干部自觉革命，就能带动广大群众起来革命；只有领导干部同广大群众一起革命，才能使革命进行彻底。
    中共麟游县委这样做了，群众说，县委同我们这样干下去，不难改变落后面貌。冶金工业部第十三建设公司领导干部这么做了，工人说，领导有决心学习焦裕禄，我们有决心学习兰考人民；兰考人民能够制服“三害”创出新天地，我们也能够战胜困难创出大庆式企业。
