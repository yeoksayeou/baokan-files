    Ugly Face of a Nuclear Bully
    U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara made a statement before the U.S. Congressional Atomic Energy Committee on the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." In addition to wantonly slandering and attacking China, he mainly spoke about the following points: First, the United States can continue to expand its nuclear arsenal at will, and countries like the Soviet Union can also have a share, but other non-nuclear countries developing nuclear weapons would "cause significant and destabilizing changes in the balance of power"; second, non-nuclear countries can be "provided guarantees" by the United States; third, the "multilateral nuclear force" plan that the United States is promoting within the North Atlantic group to allow West Germany to get involved in nuclear weapons is "not contradictory" to preventing proliferation.
    In a nutshell, McNamara's words mean one thing: the magistrate is allowed to burn down houses, while the common people are forbidden even to light lamps. He portrays the United States, the nuclear bully that threatens world peace and the security of all countries, as "bestowing blessings from heaven": all non-nuclear countries can expect to rely on it for "protection." If any country wants to develop its own nuclear weapons, that would be breaking the "balance of power."
      What does "balance of power" mean? To put it bluntly, it means trying to maintain the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is very uncomfortable with the undermining of its nuclear monopoly. However, the ruthless fact is that the U.S. nuclear overlord's monopoly has long been broken. McNamara's vigorous promotion of "preventing nuclear proliferation" is simply to maintain a bit of U.S. nuclear advantage in order to use it as capital for nuclear blackmail. Of course, on this issue, McNamara also has an unspoken intention in his statement, which is to make a dirty political deal with the Soviet leadership on the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation."
    Today, U.S. imperialism is suffering a major defeat on the South Vietnamese battlefield, scurrying like a frightened rat in the face of the raging anti-U.S. struggles of people around the world, and losing power within the imperialist bloc. All of this shows that U.S. imperialism's ambition to dominate the world has become a pipe dream. The same is true on the issue of nuclear weapons. Frankly speaking, the status of U.S. imperialism as a nuclear overlord has collapsed, and its nuclear blackmail tactics have long ceased to work in the face of the revolutionary people.

    核恶霸的嘴脸
    美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在美国国会原子能委员会就所谓“防止核扩散”问题，发表了一个声明。他除了大肆诬蔑和攻击中国之外，主要讲了这样几点：一、美国可以继续随意进行核扩军，苏联这样的国家也可以有一份，而其他非核国家发展核武器就要“引起力量均势方面重大的、破坏稳定的变动”；二、非核国家可以由美国来“提供保证”；三、美国在北大西洋集团内搞的让西德染指核武器的“多边核力量”计划同防止扩散“并无矛盾”。
    千句并一句，麦克纳马拉的话就是一个意思：只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯。他把威胁世界和平和各国安全的美国这个核恶霸，描绘成“天官赐福”：所有的非核国家，都可以指望依靠它提供“保护”。如果哪个国家要发展自己的核武器那就是打破“力量均势”。
      “力量均势”是什么意思呢？拆穿了说，就是要力图继续保持美帝国主义的核垄断地位。美帝国主义对于自己核垄断地位的动摇是十分不舒服的。但是，无情的事实却是，美国核霸王的垄断地位早已被打破了。麦克纳马拉所以这样大肆鼓吹“防止核扩散”，就是还想保持美国的一点核优势，以便作为它核讹诈的资本。当然，在这个问题上，麦克纳马拉在他的声明中还有一个没有说出来的意图，这就是要同苏联领导在所谓“防止核扩散”的问题上作一笔肮脏的政治交易。
    今天，美帝国主义在南越战场上大吃败仗，在各国人民的反美斗争怒火中狼奔豕突，在帝国主义集团内部大权旁落，凡此种种，都表明美帝国主义称霸世界的野心已经成了一场春梦。在核武器的问题上，也是如此。老实说，美帝国主义这个核霸王的地位已经崩溃了，它的核讹诈的手段在革命人民面前也早已吃不开了。
