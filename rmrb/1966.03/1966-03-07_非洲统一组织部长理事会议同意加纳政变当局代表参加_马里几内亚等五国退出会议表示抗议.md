    Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, March 6th: The Ministerial Council meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, concluded in the early hours of March 6th after eight African countries withdrew from the meeting.

    Among the eight countries that withdrew, Mali, Guinea, Tanzania, and Kenya protested the participation of representatives of the Ghana coup authorities, while Algeria, Somalia, and Congo (Brazzaville) protested the adoption of a resolution draft by the meeting's Political Committee on the Southern Rhodesia issue that took a regressive stance. The United Arab Republic protested both events.

    The sixth regular meeting of the OAU Ministerial Council, which opened on February 28th, was held after the military coup in Ghana. Many African countries accused the coup of being an imperialist-orchestrated subversive plot against African independence. Therefore, at the beginning of the meeting, representatives from Mali, Guinea, Tanzania, and other countries argued that the representatives sent by the Ghana coup authorities could not represent Ghana and were not qualified to attend the meeting. However, disregarding the opposition of representatives from many countries, the meeting agreed on March 1st to allow representatives of the Ghana coup authorities to participate, whereupon delegations from Mali and other countries withdrew from the meeting in protest.

    Malian delegation leader and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ousman Ba said upon withdrawing from the meeting on March 3rd that the presence of the Ghana coup delegation violated the principles of the OAU. He pointed out that "the Ghana coup was orchestrated by imperialists." Ousman Ba also resigned from his positions as Vice-Chairman of the meeting and Chairman of the meeting's Political Committee.

    Guinean roving ambassador Diallo Abdoulaye said after withdrawing from the meeting on March 3rd that the delegation sent by the Ghana coup authorities was a tool of the imperialists. He said, "The Organization of African Unity was established to oppose imperialism," "We are unwilling to sit next to representatives of imperialism."

    Tanzanian delegation leader and Minister of Local Government Kambona announced at the meeting on March 3rd that it was difficult for the Tanzanian delegation to work with representatives of the Ghana military regime. He said that Tanzania supports African unity but cannot sacrifice the principles supported by the OAU at the same time.

    United Arab Republic delegation leader and Foreign Minister Riad said after withdrawing from the meeting on March 3rd that from the beginning of the meeting, the United Arab Republic and many other participating countries opposed the attendance of representatives of the Ghana coup group. He also expressed opposition to the draft resolution on the Southern Rhodesia issue.

    There was also fierce debate at the meeting on the Southern Rhodesia issue. The Algerian delegation put forward a proposal advocating military action to end the rule of the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. On the other hand, Tunisia and other countries put forward a draft resolution that only required Britain to take "effective measures" against the Smith regime and allowed OAU member states not to implement the decision to sever diplomatic relations with Britain. When this regressive proposal was passed at the Political Committee meeting, representatives from Algeria, Congo (Brazzaville), and Somalia successively withdrew from the meeting in protest.

    Algerian delegation leader Rahal said after withdrawing from the meeting on March 4th that the Algerian government could never agree to a resolution that, in effect, negated all past actions of the OAU on the Southern Rhodesia issue.

    Somali Foreign Minister Dualeh said after withdrawing from the meeting on March 4th that Somalia could not support resolutions that compromised the principles on which the OAU was founded.

    The Mauritanian representative announced that he would not participate in the work of the meeting because he opposed the Tunisian proposal on the Southern Rhodesia issue.

    In view of the opposition of many countries, the Council adopted some amendments to the proposal on Southern Rhodesia on the 5th, including deleting the section allowing member states not to sever diplomatic relations with Britain. Four countries did not vote during the vote, and one country abstained.

    During the meeting, the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia was very active. According to a report from Addis Ababa in Cairo's Al-Ahram on the 5th, since the opening of the OAU Ministerial Council meeting, U.S. Ambassador Edward Korry always arrived at the meeting place every morning at the beginning of the meeting, talked to some delegations, and then returned in the afternoon, staying in the lounge attached to the venue, and waited until the meeting adjourned before leaving, no matter how long the meeting lasted.

### 非洲统一组织部长理事会议同意加纳政变当局代表参加  马里几内亚等五国退出会议表示抗议

    非洲统一组织部长理事会议同意加纳政变当局代表参加
    马里几内亚等五国退出会议表示抗议
    新华社六日讯　亚的斯亚贝巴消息：在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴举行的非洲统一组织部长理事会会议，在八个非洲国家先后退出会议后，已于三月六日凌晨闭幕。
    在退出会议的这八个国家中，马里、几内亚、坦桑尼亚和肯尼亚四国是抗议加纳政变当局的代表参加会议，阿尔及利亚、索马里和刚果（布）三国是抗议会议的政治委员会在南罗得西亚问题上通过了采取倒退立场的决议草案，阿联是抗议上述两个事件。
    在二月二十八日开幕的非洲统一组织部长理事会第六次例会，是在加纳发生军事政变后举行的。许多非洲国家指责这次政变是帝国主义策划的、针对非洲独立的一个颠覆阴谋。因此，会议一开始，马里、几内亚和坦桑尼亚等国代表就提出，加纳政变当局派出的代表不能代表加纳，没有资格出席会议。然而，会议不顾许多国家代表的反对，在三月一日同意让加纳政变当局的代表参加会议，于是马里等国代表团纷纷退出会议，表示抗议。
    马里代表团团长、负责外交事务国务部长乌斯曼·巴三日在退出会议时说，加纳政变代表团出席会议是违反非洲统一组织原则的。他指出，“加纳政变是由帝国主义者策划的。”乌斯曼·巴还为此辞去了会议副主席和会议政治委员会主席的职务。
    几内亚巡回大使迪亚洛·阿卜杜拉耶三日在退出会议后说，加纳政变当局派出的代表团是帝国主义者的工具。他说，
  “建立非洲统一组织是为了反对帝国主义”，“我们不愿意坐在帝国主义的代表的旁边”。
    坦桑尼亚代表团团长、地方政府部长坎博纳三日在会上宣布，坦桑尼亚代表团很难同加纳军事政权的代表在一起工作。他说，坦桑尼亚支持非洲统一，但是同时不能牺牲非洲统一组织所支持的原则。
    阿联代表团团长、外交部长里亚德三日在退出会议后说，从会议一开始，阿联和其他许多参加会议的国家就反对加纳政变集团的代表出席会议。他还表示反对关于南罗得西亚问题的决议草案。
    会议在南罗得西亚问题上也发生了激烈的争论。阿尔及利亚代表团提出了主张采取军事行动，来结束南罗得西亚史密斯政权统治的建议。另一方面，突尼斯等国提出一项决议草案，只要求英国对史密斯政权采取“有效措施”，并容许非洲统一组织成员国不执行与英国断绝外交关系的决定。当这项倒退的提案在政治委员会会议上通过后，阿尔及利亚、刚果（布）、索马里代表相继退出会议表示反对。
    阿尔及利亚代表团团长拉哈勒四日在退出会议后说，阿尔及利亚政府决不能同意这样的决议：它事实上等于否定非洲统一组织过去在南罗得西亚问题上的一切行动。
    索马里外交部长杜阿莱四日退出会议后说，索马里不能支持那些在非洲统一组织作为基础的原则上进行妥协的决议。
    毛里塔尼亚代表由于反对关于南罗得西亚问题的突尼斯提案，宣布不参加会议的工作。
    鉴于不少国家反对，理事会五日通过关于南罗得西亚的提案时，作了一些修改，包括删去其中关于容许成员国不同英国断绝外交关系的一节。表决时，有四个国家没有投票，一个国家弃权。
    在会议举行期间，美国驻埃塞俄比亚大使活动频繁。据开罗《金字塔报》五日从亚的斯亚贝巴报道，从非洲统一组织部长理事会会议开幕以来，美国大使爱德华·科里总是每天早晨会议开始时就到开会地点，同一些代表团谈话，然后下午又回来，留在会场附设的休息室里，不论会议开多久，都要等到会议散会才离开。
