    New Sisters in the Countryside
    Hong Qi
    “You ask how my sister and I took root in the countryside? Well, how can I say? Let me start from the beginning.
    “My sister's name is Feng Shumei, and she is currently the Deputy Director of the Women's Federation in the Red Star Commune. My name is Feng Shulan, and I am twenty-two years old this year. I am the women's captain and director of the Women's Federation in the Zhiyuanzhuang Production Team.
    “People say we are revolutionary sisters. Actually, what we have done is still far from the Party's requirements and the hopes of the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    “How were we tempered? That's a long story.
    “Since I was little, I wanted to be a tractor driver, driving the iron ox frantically on the land of our motherland, in the fields of our commune. When I graduated from junior high school, my sister graduated from senior high school. That's right, it was 1962. Just when the Party was calling on educated youth to return to the countryside and participate in agricultural production, I was determined to return to the countryside. Just as I was thinking about it, my sister came. She was the propaganda committee member of the Communist Youth League Committee of Beijing No. 18 Middle School.
    “She turned her big eyes, her thick black eyebrows rising and falling, and said, ‘Shulan, our family had endless suffering in the old society. After liberation, our family of three has been living on government relief, and our disabled father entered the home for the elderly. The state even provided us with schooling. Now that we have grown up, we must not forget the kindness of the Party and the poor and lower-middle peasants.’ I was surprised, why did she mention these things again today? In the past, she often mentioned these things to me when I was disobedient. She also said, ‘Our country is still very poor, and industry and agriculture need to develop greatly. Our country is a backward agricultural country…’ She went on and on, and I got anxious: ‘If you have something to say, say it quickly, I just like to be straightforward.’ She smiled and said, ‘Are you afraid of being tired?’
    ‘No!’
    ‘Are you afraid of hardship?’
    ‘No!’ At this point, I stood up abruptly and glared at her, asking: ‘Can’t you just say it straight!’
    ‘Don’t be anxious.’ My sister giggled, ‘What do you think about us returning to the countryside to participate in agricultural production?’
    ‘Oh, after talking for so long, that’s it!’ I was both angry and amused, ‘We thought of the same thing.’ After thinking for a while, I asked again: ‘Does Old Su know?’ You don’t know who Old Su is yet! He is the Party branch secretary of our production team, the model worker Su Shuye, and a relative to us sisters.
    “My sister said: ‘Look at what you’re saying, I already discussed it with Old Su. Old Su said we were doing the right thing, and the village especially needs educated youth like us.’
    “My sister and I returned home together. Our home is the production team.
    “The team cleared out a room for us. Just as we got to the door, Old Su greeted us. Seeing that his hands were covered in mud, I asked him: ‘What have you been doing?’ He just smiled and didn't say anything, letting us into the room. Hey, Old Su and poor peasant Uncle Dong had already built the kang and the stove for us.
    “Then, everyone brought us pots, bowls, spoons, grain, flour, and vegetables. Seeing how much the poor and lower-middle peasants cared about us, I felt so warm inside.
    “Back in the village, I felt like I had endless energy. I carried soil at a brisk pace and plowed the land without even raising my head. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised me for working so hard, and I was really happy. I thought, doing agricultural work just requires a lot of brute force. But once, I and Niu Xiuying, Su Daoying, and a few other young people went to transplant rice seedlings. I mustered all my strength to surpass them, but my hands wouldn't listen to me. After a while, I fell behind and my back and legs were aching. They said: ‘Transplanting rice with you, we have to transplant two fen less land every day.’
    ‘You don't have any sense of unity!’ I got anxious.
    “At this time, Old Su came over, looked at me about to cry, and looked down at my legs, which were cracked by the wind, and said with affection:
    ‘Come over here, clean your legs and put some oil on them.’ After saying that, he walked into the field, picked up the rice seedlings, bent down, and quickly transplanted them. Hey, it was fast and good. I admired him from the bottom of my heart. Why couldn't I do it? At this time, Old Su called me over and said, ‘You can't just blame others for not having unity. Why are you transplanting slowly? You have to check yourself first. Go back and ask your sister how she learned to transplant rice seedlings.’
    “In the evening, I finally waited for my sister to come back. She became the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch not long after returning to the village and was so busy that she couldn't come home. This time, I asked her to teach me how to transplant rice seedlings. But she took out two books, *Serve the People* and *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, and said that Old Su told her that if your technique isn't good, it's mainly because your thinking isn't good, and told me to study these two books carefully. I thought: I have to listen to Old Su. I reopened these two books and studied them. As I studied, I thought, isn't my slow transplanting just because my technique is not high? I want to learn Norman Bethune's attitude of striving for perfection in technique. From then on, I always held a handful of seedlings, practicing twisting the seedlings while walking, practicing twisting the seedlings while talking, and practicing twisting the seedlings after putting down my bowl.
    “Before long, I became the leader of the youth shock team.
    “At first, I didn't know how to work, and sometimes I cried out of anger. Old Su said to me: ‘To raise other people’s thinking, you have to do work. Can you cry backward people into becoming advanced ones?’ I couldn't help but laugh. Old Su's words really touched people's hearts. In the evening, according to Old Su's instructions, I studied *Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods*. My sister also said when she came back: ‘To improve people’s thinking, you must first start by caring about the well-being of the masses. This is Chairman Mao’s teaching.’
    “I did what Chairman Mao said. There was an old poor peasant in our team named Wei Shuangyin who had worked as a hired laborer all his life in the old society. One afternoon, I heard people say that Uncle Wei had not yet returned to eat. I was stunned and remembered that the old man hadn't looked well these days and must be sick. I looked for him everywhere and finally found him in the feeding shed outside the village. I helped him back to the village, asked a doctor for him, got medicine, cooked for him, and took care of him day and night. Oh, you want me to talk about my thoughts at the time. This is what happened: I sent Uncle Wei back, went into the room, turned around and came out, and heard him say weakly outside: ‘Girl, go do your work, don't worry about me, I'm fine.’ Hearing these words, I felt a burst of sadness in my heart. He was sick, but he was thinking about the team's work. I ran outside because I thought he was dirty. At this moment, I remembered what Chairman Mao said, that the cleanest people are workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are cleaner than the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao said it so right. Thinking of these things, I didn't mind him being dirty when I took his urine.
    “Later, my sister was transferred to the commune, and I was elected secretary of the Communist Youth League branch.
    “There was a member of the Communist Youth League in the branch named Liu Chuanjiang, and everyone had a lot of opinions about him. I thought, he is from a poor peasant family, and I should help him more. One day, he was playing cards, and I walked over and said in a low voice: ‘Here is this *China Youth* for you to read. There are some good articles in it.’
    ‘Bah, who reads your junk!’ Unexpectedly, Liu Chuanjiang threw the book hard on the ground and left.
    ‘You, you, dead backw…’ I wanted to say he was dead backwards. But then I thought, I can’t do that. Chairman Mao said that work must be thorough and meticulous, and ideological work cannot be solved in one morning. Lei Feng was as warm as spring to his comrades, and Norman Bethune was extremely enthusiastic to his comrades. My sister often said that I should ‘change my stubborn temper’. I picked up the book and chased after him and said, ‘Chuanjiang, take a look, this book is very good, you take a look.’ Seeing that I was not angry and was still so enthusiastic, Xiao Liu took the book. After that, I often talked to him, and he slowly became a good youth in our team.
    “Because I did some things that I should have done, studied Chairman Mao's books, and listened to Chairman Mao's words. Therefore, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village regarded me as their own daughter. In fact, I still don't care about them enough and haven't met the Party's requirements.
    “Ah! There is also the most important point that I missed. On June 23 last year, the commune party committee simultaneously approved our sisters' admission to the Party. We sang, we danced, and we were so happy that we shed tears. Old Su held our hands tightly and said: From today onwards, the Party has put forward higher requirements for you.
    “Okay, that's all I have to say.”

    农村新姐妹
    洪琪
    “你问我们姐俩是怎样在农村扎根的吗，这可怎么说呢，我还是从头说起吧。
    “我姐姐叫冯淑美，她眼下在红星公社，是妇联副主任。我呢，叫冯淑兰，今年二十二岁，在志远庄生产队，是妇女队长兼妇联主任。
    “人们都说我们是革命姐妹。其实，我们做的离党的要求，离贫下中农的希望，还差远哪。
    “我们是怎么锻炼的？那说起来话就长啦。
    “我从小就想当一名拖拉机手，驾驶着铁牛在祖国的大地上，在我们公社的田野里，拼命地跑。初中毕业那年，我姐姐高中毕业。对啦，是一九六二年。正是党号召知识青年回乡参加农业生产的时候，我就决心回农村。正想着，姐姐来了。她是北京十八中团委会的宣传委员。
    “她转动着大眼睛，浓黑的眉毛一纵纵的，说：‘淑兰，咱家在旧社会，有说不完的苦水呀。解放后，咱们一家三口一直在政府救济下生活，残废的爸爸进了敬老院。国家还供咱俩上了学。咱长大成人了，可不能忘了党和贫下中农的恩情呵。’我奇怪，她今天为什么又说起这些事。过去，她常在我不听话的时候，跟我提这些。她又说：‘咱国家还很穷，工农业要大发展，咱国家是个落后农业国……’说起来没完，我急了：‘你要说什么，就快说吧，我就喜欢直来直去。’她笑了，说‘你怕累吗？’
    ‘不怕！’
    ‘你怕苦吗？’
    ‘不怕！’这会，我腾地站起来，瞪起眼睛问她：‘你就不会直说了！’
    ‘别急呀。’姐姐嘎嘎地笑了，‘咱回乡参加农业生产你看行吗？’
    ‘唉呀，说了半天就是这个！’我又气又笑，‘咱俩想到一条道上了。’我想了一会，又问：‘老苏知道了吗？’你还不知道老苏是谁吧！他是我们生产队的党支部书记，劳动模范苏树业，我们姐俩的亲人。
    “姐姐说：‘瞧你说的，早跟老苏商量了，老苏说我们做得对，村里特需要我们这样的知识青年。’
    “我们姐俩双双回到家。我们这个家，就是生产队。
    “队上给我们腾出了一间房，刚到门口，老苏就迎了出来，一看他两手沾满了泥，我就问他：‘您干什么了啊？’他光笑不说话，把我们让进屋里，嘿，老苏和贫农董大爷已经给我们盘好了炕，搭好了灶。
    “接着，大家给我们送来锅碗盆勺、粮面、蔬菜。看到贫下中农这么关心我们，心里好热。
    “回到村里，我觉得浑身的劲都使不完，挑起土来一溜小跑，刨起地来头也不抬，贫下中农都夸我干活真冲，我心里真高兴，心想，干农业活多使点笨劲儿就行。可有一次，我和牛秀英、苏道英几个青年去插秧。我憋足劲要超过她们去，可手不听使唤，没干一会，就落在后面了，还累的腰酸腿疼，她们却说：‘和你一块插秧呀，每天得少插二分地。’
    ‘你们没有一点团结性！’我急了。
    “这时，老苏走来了，看着我要哭的样子，低头看了看我的腿，风吹裂了，疼爱地说：
  ‘过来吧，把腿擦干净，抹点油。’说完，他走进池子，拿起稻秧，弯下腰去，刷刷地插起来，嘿，又快又好，我打从心眼里羡慕，怎么我就不能呢？这时，老苏把我叫过去，说‘你不能光怪别人没团结性，你为什么插的慢，得先检查自己，回去问问你姐姐，她是怎样学会插秧的。’
    “晚上，好不容易等着姐姐回来了。她呀，回村不久，就当上了团支书，成天忙得回不了家。这回，我就让她教我插秧。她却拿出两本《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》的书来，还说是老苏说的，技术不过硬，主要是思想不过硬，让我好好学习这两本书。我想：老苏的话我得听，我又重新翻开了这两本书，学着，学着，我想，我插秧慢，不就是技术不高吗？我要学习白求恩对技术精益求精的态度。从那儿起，我总拿着一把秧，走路练捻秧，说话练捻秧，撂下饭碗练捻秧。
    “过不久，我当了青年突击队的组长。
    “开始自己不会工作，有时一个人气得哭鼻子。老苏对我说：‘要别人思想高起来，得做工作。你哭，能把后进的哭成先进吗？’我忍不住笑了。老苏这些话，真打动人的心。晚上，我按老苏的嘱咐，学习《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。姐姐回来也说：‘要提高人的思想，必须先从关心群众生活入手。这是毛主席的教导。’
    “毛主席怎么说的我就怎么做。我队有个老贫农，名叫魏双银，在旧社会扛了一辈子长活。一天下午，听人说魏大爷还没回来吃饭。我一愣，想起老人这几天脸色不好，准病了。就到处找他，最后在村外的饲养棚找到了。我把他搀回村，给他请大夫、取药、做饭、端尿，白天黑夜服侍他。噢，你还要我说说当时的想法，是这么回事：我把魏大爷送回去，进屋，扭头就出来了，在外边听他有气无力地说：‘闺女，你干活去吧，别管我，我不碍事。’听了这话，我心里一阵酸疼，他病着，心里惦记的是队里活，我往外跑是嫌他脏。这会儿，我想起毛主席说的最干净的是工人、农民，尽管他们手是黑的脚上有牛屎，还比资产阶级和小资产阶级干净。毛主席说的多对呀。想起这些，我端尿也不嫌他脏了。
    “后来，姐姐调公社了，我被选为团支部书记。
    “团支部里有个团员叫刘传江，大伙对他意见可大了，我想，他是贫农子弟，我得多帮助他。一天，他正在玩牌，我走过去，压低了嗓音说：‘给你这本《中国青年》看，里边有几篇好文章。’
    ‘呸，谁看你这玩艺！’真没想到，刘传江把书使劲扔在地上走了。
    ‘你，你，死落……’我想说他死落后。可我又一想，不能这样。毛主席说做工作要深入细致，思想工作不是一个早晨就能解决的。雷锋对同志象春天般温暖，白求恩对同志极端热忱。姐姐也常说我‘改改你那牛脾气’。我就捡起书又追上他说，‘传江，看看吧，这书可好了，你看看吧。’小刘见我不发火，还这么热心，就接过书。之后，我经常和他谈心，他慢慢成了我队的好青年。
    “因为我做了些我应该做的事，学了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话。所以，村里贫下中农就把我当成亲闺女。其实，我对他们关心还不够，还没有达到党的要求。
    “啊呀！还有最重要的一点我漏了，去年六月二十三日，公社党委同时批准我们姐俩入党了。我们唱呵，跳呵，高兴得直掉眼泪。老苏紧紧握住我们的手说：从今天起，党对你们提出了更高的要求。
    “好了，就说这些吧。”
