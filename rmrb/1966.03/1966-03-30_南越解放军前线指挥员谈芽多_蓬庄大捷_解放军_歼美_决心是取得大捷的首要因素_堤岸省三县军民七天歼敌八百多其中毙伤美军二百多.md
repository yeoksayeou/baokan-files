    Hanoi, March 28th, Xinhua News Agency—According to a broadcast by the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, the frontline commander of the great victory of Nha Do—Phu Nhuan in South Vietnam recently stated that the victory of the South Vietnam Liberation Army on February 24th in completely annihilating two infantry battalions and two armored battalions of the U.S. First Infantry Division at Nha Do—Phu Nhuan was another heavy blow to the U.S. conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. In this battle, the Liberation Army soldiers’ deep-seated hatred for the enemy and high determination to "annihilate the Americans" were the primary factors in achieving this great victory.

    He pointed out that the great victory of Nha Do—Phu Nhuan, together with the victories achieved by the military and civilians in Cu Chi District, Rach Gia Province, Bien Hoa Province, and the central Trung Bo plains, contributed to defeating the American aggressors' "pacification" plan.

    He said that the great victory of Nha Do—Phu Nhuan marked a new growth of the Liberation Army. The morale of the Liberation Army is very high, and they are eager day and night to annihilate the American invading forces. Many people wrote letters of determination before the battle, setting out plans to annihilate the American bandits, determined to become glorious "American-annihilating heroes." Therefore, when they received the order to attack the American bandits who were conducting "sweeps," the soldiers traveled day and night, rushing to the battlefield. They were not afraid of any difficulties and hardships, created many ways to annihilate the enemy, and successfully realized the battle plan. This spiritual factor is the result of improved political awareness and is the primary factor in achieving the great victory of Nha Do—Phu Nhuan.

    He said that the Liberation Army also fully utilized the advantages of people's war in terms of command and tactics. The Liberation Army units cooperated closely with each other, completely isolating the enemy. The Liberation Army excellently used close combat tactics, wiping out the enemy's headquarters at the beginning. At the same time, the troops went deep into the enemy's camp, dividing and encircling the enemy forces, and eliminating them quickly and cleanly.

    He said that in this battle, many examples of heroic fighting emerged. Many soldiers, when enemy tanks were rampant, disregarded all dangers, cleverly and bravely climbed onto the enemy tanks, opened the turret cover, and threw grenades inside, eliminating the enemy soldiers inside. Chen Hongxie, a soldier who was not yet eighteen years old, fought the enemy with bayonets in a trench alone, stabbing three American invaders to death in one breath. Some artillerymen destroyed five enemy vehicles with only six shells.

    The commander finally said that the great victory of Nha Do—Phu Nhuan was another heavy blow to the U.S. First Infantry Division. However, it can be said with certainty that it will suffer even more fatal blows.

    Hanoi, March 27th, Xinhua News Agency—According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of Duc Hoa, Duc Hue, and Ben Luc districts in Thu Dau Mot Province near Saigon in South Vietnam, in their counter-"sweep" battles from March 14th to 20th, annihilated more than 800 enemies in total (including killing and wounding more than 200 American invading soldiers and completely annihilating a puppet army ranger company), destroyed and damaged ten M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, shot down and damaged seven enemy aircraft of various types, and damaged two warships.

    The report said that starting from the 14th, the enemy dispatched a total of seven battalions of U.S. and puppet troops to carry out "sweeps" in the villages along the Dong Van Co River in Duc Hoa, Duc Hue, and Ben Luc districts. The local military and civilians immediately gave a head-on blow, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. The military and civilians of Shengli Township in Ben Luc County alone wiped out more than 200 enemy troops from the puppet 25th Division.

    Throughout the counter-"sweep" battle, the militia in various villages fully utilized the great power of people's guerrilla warfare, constantly attacking the enemy and carrying out surprise attacks deep into the enemy's camp, making the enemy suffer blows everywhere and unable to attend to everything. After suffering heavy blows in succession, these seven battalions of enemies had no choice but to flee back in a panic on the 20th.

    The report said that this counter-"sweep" victory is another victory achieved by the military and civilians of Thu Dau Mot Province after wiping out more than 700 enemies in the Duc Hoa and Duc Hue areas at the beginning of this year.

    南越解放军前线指挥员谈芽多—蓬庄大捷
    解放军“歼美”决心是取得大捷的首要因素
    堤岸省三县军民七天歼敌八百多其中毙伤美军二百多
    新华社河内二十八日电 据越南南方解放电台广播，越南南方芽多—蓬庄大捷的前线指挥员最近发表谈话指出，越南南方解放军二月二十四日在芽多—蓬庄全歼美国第一步兵师的两个步兵营和两个装甲营的胜利，是对美国扩大侵越战争阴谋的又一次沉重打击。在这次战斗中，解放军战士对敌人的刻骨仇恨和高度的“歼美”决心，是取得这次大捷的首要因素。
    他指出，芽多—蓬庄大捷同古芝县、迪石省、边和省、中部中区平原等地军民所取得的胜利一起，为击败美国侵略者的“绥靖”计划作出了贡献。
    他说，芽多—蓬庄大捷标志着解放军新的成长。解放军的士气非常高，他们日夜都在渴望着歼灭美国侵略军。很多人在战斗前都写了决心书，订出歼灭美国强盗的计划，决心使自己成为光荣的“歼美勇士”。因此当接到袭击正在进行“扫荡”的美国强盗的命令时，战士们日夜兼程，奔赴战场。他们不怕一切艰难困苦，创造了许多歼灭敌人的办法，圆满地实现了战斗计划。这种精神因素是政治觉悟提高的结果，是取得芽多—蓬庄大捷的首要因素。
    他说，解放军在指挥、战术等方面也充分发挥了人民战争的优点。解放军各部队之间紧密配合，使敌人完全陷于孤立的境地。解放军出色地运用了近战战术，在一开始就把敌人的指挥部吃掉。同时各部队深入敌军营地，分割、包围敌军，迅速而干净地消灭它们。
    他说，在这场战斗中，涌现出许多英勇战斗的榜样。许多战士在敌人的坦克逞凶的时候，不顾一切危险，机智勇敢地爬上敌军的坦克，揭开炮塔盖，把手榴弹投进去，消灭车内敌军。不满十八岁的战士陈鸿协，一个人在战壕里同敌人拼刺刀，一口气刺死三个美国侵略者。有的炮手只用六发炮弹，就击毁了敌军的五辆战车。
    这位指挥员最后说，芽多—蓬庄大捷是对美国第一步兵师的又一次沉重打击。但是，可以肯定地说，它还会遭到更致命的打击。
    新华社河内二十七日电据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方西贡附近堤岸省德和、德惠和边沥三县军民在从三月十四日到二十日的反“扫荡”战斗中，共歼灭敌人八百多名（其中打死、打伤美国侵略军二百多名，全歼伪军别动队一个连），击毁、击伤M—113型两栖装甲车十辆，击落、击伤各种类型敌机七架，击伤战船两艘。
    报道说，从十四日开始，敌人出动美伪军共七个营，到德和、德惠、边沥三县境内东万古河沿岸各乡进行“扫荡”。当地军民立即给予迎头痛击，使敌人遭到很大伤亡。仅边沥县盛利乡军民就一举歼灭伪二十五师的敌军二百多名。
    在整个反“扫荡”战斗中，各乡游击队充分发挥人民游击战争的强大威力，不断袭击敌人，并深入敌军营地进行奇袭，使敌人处处挨打，顾此失彼。这七个营的敌人在连续遭到惨重打击后，不得不于二十日狼狈逃窜回去。
    报道说，这次反“扫荡”胜利是堤岸省军民继今年年初在德和、德惠地区一举歼敌七百多名之后取得的又一次胜利。
