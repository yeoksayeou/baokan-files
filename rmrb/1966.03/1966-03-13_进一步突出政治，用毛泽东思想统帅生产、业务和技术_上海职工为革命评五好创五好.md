    Further Emphasize Politics, Use Mao Zedong Thought to Command Production, Business, and Technology
    Shanghai Workers Evaluate and Create "Five Goods" for the Revolution
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 11) A mass movement of evaluating "Five Goods" for the revolution, striving for "Five Goods" for the revolution, and creating "Five Goods" for the revolution is being carried out in depth on Shanghai's industrial and transportation front. Through summary evaluations, the vast number of cadres and workers further emphasize politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to command production, command business, and command technology, their revolutionary spirit is more vigorous, and the movement to increase production and practice economy is developing more deeply forward.
    According to the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the beginning of this year, the industrial and transportation departments, in conjunction with summarizing the work of the past year, extensively carried out activities to establish pacesetters, promote advanced elements, exchange experiences, and evaluate "Five Good" workers, "Five Good" groups, and "Five Good" workshops.
    To engage in production for the revolution and to work for the revolution have become the slogans of action for the vast number of workers. They take "Good political ideology, Good completion of tasks, Good compliance with discipline, Good constant learning, Good unity and mutual assistance" as their direction of effort. They believe that all five aspects must be good, but the most fundamental is good political ideology. Politics is the soul and the foundation, and good political ideology should be placed first, with one "good" leading "four goods."
        Whether or not a person's political ideology is good is prominently manifested
    in whether or not they act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions
    In the evaluation process, the vast number of workers conducted in-depth discussions on the relationship between politics and production, politics and technology, and politics and business, which enlightened and educated many cadres.
    Some cadres said that in the past they talked about emphasizing politics, but in reality, they believed that "good political ideology is empty, invisible and intangible." However, workers in many factories used vivid facts to illustrate that whether a person's political ideology is good is prominently manifested in whether or not they listen to Chairman Mao? Is it working for the revolution and for the people, or for "me"? For public or for private? Two kinds of thinking and two kinds of manifestations are clearly distinguished at all times, in matters big and small.
    The example of Cao Zhihong, a punch press worker at Shanghai Radio Factory No. 2, shows that as long as a person has the idea of ​​wholeheartedly serving the people and wholeheartedly serving the revolution, there will be a huge driving force for work. Cao Zhihong was fast and skilled, and was once known as the "Miracle Puncher." However, for a long time, he only produced 600 kilograms of silicon steel sheets for transformers per day, just completing the quota. Last year, he studied Chairman Mao's works and studied Wang Jie, further establishing the idea of ​​producing for the revolution and fully leveraging his technical expertise. The same person, using the same equipment, with proletarian ideas in his mind, the production effect is very different. Recently, Cao Zhihong's daily output reached 1,000 kilograms, and he also often actively assisted the group in doing ideological and political work and group management work, and helped others improve their skills. The workers said that he is now a veritable "Miracle Puncher."
    Many workers in the Shanghai Watch Factory believe that only with a hard ideology can hard tasks be completed, and this "hard" is truly hard. They cited examples from outside the factory to examples inside the factory: Daqing Oilfield started with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." When the ideology became hard, the oil came out. Their own factory makes watches. Without experience or equipment, with the ambition to fill the country's gaps, when the ideology became hard, the watches were made. Many people also cited many examples to prove that "if the political ideology is good, things will definitely be made. Although some people cannot produce hard things temporarily, they will eventually complete hard tasks." The Comprehensive Group of the Tool Workshop in this factory has several workers whose technical level is not high, but their political ideology is good. In order to catch up with the advanced level and make a trademark engraving machine, they adhered to the revolution without drawings or equipment, studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," visited fraternal factories, and collectively came up with ideas and solutions, and finally overcame numerous difficulties and built the machine. The workers said: "The emergence of this machine proves that when the ideology becomes hard, the results will be completed hard."
     If you do not emphasize politics and do not adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, you will lose the qualification to be a leader
    How can we emphasize politics? The workers believe that it is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions; correctly handle the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the country; not only think about the Chinese revolution, but also think about the world revolution; in a word, it is everything for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the revolution.
    Many cadres have been educated from the workers' debates and further realized that whether the relationship between politics, production, business, and technology is handled well is a matter of principle related to where the team is led. If you do not emphasize politics and do not adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, you will lose the qualification to be a leader. Some cadres self-critically said that in the past, they also emphasized politics verbally, but in reality, when tasks were busy, they "emphasized business over politics." When their standpoints and views were biased, production often slid into evil ways.
    The large number of advanced figures emerging is a powerful shock to the metaphysical thinking methods of many cadres. Many cadres felt that their understanding lagged behind the rapidly developing situation and underestimated the profound changes in the mental outlook of the workers. According to the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the vast number of cadres on the industrial and transportation front earnestly studied the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics and strengthening ideological and political work, fully promoted democracy in the evaluation and selection, boldly mobilized the masses, and relied on the revolutionary consciousness of the masses. As a result, some people who worked diligently and buried their heads in work for the revolution, and some workers who were previously backward and have now transformed, were evaluated by the masses as advanced and established as pacesetters.
    The activity of evaluating and creating "Five Goods" promotes workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with deeper class feelings
    The activity of creating "Five Goods" and striving for "Five Goods" promotes the vast number of workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with deeper class feelings. The workers said: Just exchanging technical experience, different industries are like different mountains, and you can't learn anything if you're not in the same industry; now we are exchanging experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, exchanging advanced ideas, and different industries share the same principle. Many groups often combine current production tasks and active thoughts within the group to select and read quotations from Chairman Mao; some hang blackboards and signs with quotations from Chairman Mao in front of steelmaking furnaces and next to machine tools. When there are problems in production and study, the workers first consult Chairman Mao's works; when there are disputes, everyone acts in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. Everyone feels happy, and everyone is full of energy. There is both democracy and centralization. Cadres and workers are even more determined to work hard and strive to catch up with advanced scientific and technological levels.
    The revolutionary and production enthusiasm of the workers is promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy to develop more deeply forward. In the first month of this year, the production tasks of various departments on Shanghai's industrial and transportation front were completed very successfully. The output of many raw materials, materials and important products urgently needed by the country exceeded the original planned targets. Many factories have accelerated the pace of catching up with advanced scientific and technological levels. New materials, new processes, new technologies, new equipment and new designs were widely adopted, enabling the successful trial production of some new types of products with higher levels in advance. Mass technical innovation and technical revolution activities are more active, and increased production has been achieved with fewer people and less equipment.

### 进一步突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产、业务和技术  上海职工为革命评五好创五好

    进一步突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产、业务和技术
    上海职工为革命评五好创五好
    据新华社上海十一日电　一个为革命评五好、为革命争五好和为革命创五好的群众运动，正在上海工业交通战线深入开展。通过总结评比，广大干部职工进一步突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产、统帅业务、统帅技术，革命精神更加奋发，增产节约运动更加深入地向前发展。
    根据中共上海市委的决定，今年年初，工业交通部门结合总结一年以来的工作，广泛开展了树标兵、发扬先进、交流经验、评比五好职工、五好小组、五好车间的活动。
    为革命搞生产，为革命工作，已经成为广大职工的行动口号。他们把“政治思想好、完成任务好、遵守纪律好、经常学习好、团结互助好”，作为自己努力的方向。他们认为，五个方面都要好，但是最根本的一条是政治思想好。政治是灵魂、是根本，要把政治思想好放在首位，一好带“四好”。
        一个人政治思想好不好，突出地表现
    为是不是按毛主席的指示办事
    广大职工在评比过程中，就政治和生产、政治和技术，以及政治和业务的关系，进行了深入的讨论，使不少干部受到启发，得到教育。
    有的干部说，过去他们嘴上也讲突出政治，实际上却认为“政治思想好是空的，看不见摸不着”。可是许多厂职工用生动的事实说明，一个人政治思想好不好，突出地表现为是不是听毛主席的话？是为革命、为人民工作，还是为了“我”？为公还是为私？两种思想、两种表现，每时每刻，在大小事情上都界限分明。
    上海无线电二厂冲床工曹志鸿的例子表明，一个人只要有了一心为人民、一心为革命的思想，工作就有巨大的动力。曹志鸿手脚快，技术高，一度被人称为“神冲手”。但是在较长时间里，他冲制变压器用的硅钢片，日产量只达到六百公斤，刚刚完成定额。去年，他学习了毛主席著作，学习了王杰，进一步树立为革命而生产的思想，充分发挥了技术特长。同样的人，用同样的设备，头脑里有了无产阶级思想，生产效果就大不相同。最近，曹志鸿的日产量达到了一千公斤，还常常主动协助小组做思想政治工作和小组管理工作，帮助别人提高技术。工人们说，现在才是名副其实的“神冲手”。
    上海手表厂许多职工认为，只有思想硬，才能完成硬任务，这个“硬”，才是真正硬。他们从厂外事例举到厂内事例说：大庆油田，以“两论”起家，思想硬了，石油就出来了。自己厂做手表，在一无经验、二无设备的情况下，凭着一股填补国家空白的志气，思想硬了，手表也就造出来了。不少人还举出了许多事例，证明了“政治思想好，东西一定搞得出来。有些人虽然暂时拿不出硬东西，但终究会完成硬任务的。”这个厂工具车间综合组有几个工人技术水平不高，可是政治思想好。他们为了赶超先进水平，搞一台商标刻字机，在没有图纸、没有设备的情况下，坚持革命，学习《愚公移山》，到兄弟厂参观，集体出主意想办法，终于克服了重重困难，把机器造出来了。工人说：“这台机器的产生就证明，思想硬了，成果就完成得硬。”
     如果不突出政治，不坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，就要失去作领导的资格
    怎样才算突出了政治？职工们认为就是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事；正确处理个人、集体和国家三者的关系；不仅想着中国革命，还要想着世界革命；一句话，就是一切为革命，一心为革命。
    不少干部从工人群众的辩论中得到了教育，进一步看到，政治和生产、业务、技术的关系处理得好不好，是关系到把队伍带向哪里的原则问题。不突出政治，不坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，就要失去作领导的资格。有的干部自我批评说，过去口头上也强调突出政治，实际上任务一忙，就“轻政治、重业务”，立场、观点偏了，生产往往也滑到邪道上去。
    先进人物的大量涌现，对不少干部形而上学的思想方法是一次强有力的冲击。不少干部感到自己认识落后于飞速发展的形势，对职工群众精神面貌深刻变化估计不足。根据中共上海市委的指示，工交战线广大干部认真学习解放军突出政治、加强政治思想工作的经验，在评选中充分发扬民主，放手发动群众，依靠群众革命自觉性。结果，有些勤勤恳恳、为革命埋头工作的人，有些以前后进、现在已经转变了的职工，被群众评为先进、树为标兵。
    评五好创五好的活动，推动职工以更深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作
    创五好、争五好的活动，推动广大职工以更深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作。职工们说：光交流技术经验，隔行如隔山，不是同工种就学不到什么；现在交流的是活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，交流的是先进思想，隔行不隔理。很多小组，经常结合当前生产任务和组内活思想，选读毛主席语录；有的把写有毛主席语录的黑板和牌子挂在炼钢炉前，机床旁边。生产、学习中有了什么问题，职工们首先向毛主席著作请教；有什么争论，大家遵照毛主席教导办事，人人心情舒畅，个个干劲充沛，既有民主，又有集中，干部和工人更加奋发图强，努力赶超先进的科学技术水平。
    职工群众的革命和生产积极性，正在推动增产节约运动更加深入地向前发展。今年开头一个月，上海工业交通战线上各个部门的生产任务完成得都很出色。不少国家急需的原料、材料和重要产品产量，都超过原订计划指标。许多厂赶超先进科学技术水平的步伐加快了。广泛地采用了新材料、新工艺、新技术、新设备和新设计，使一些新型的具有较高水平的产品提前试制成功。群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动更加活跃，在减人减设备的情况下实现了增产。
