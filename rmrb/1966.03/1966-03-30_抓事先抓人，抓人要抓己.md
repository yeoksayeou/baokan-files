Editor's note: The author of this article vividly illustrates several important issues through personal experience: Leading production cannot be simply about grasping production without grasping people's thoughts. Focusing solely on production yields one if you grasp one, two if you grasp two, and zero if you don't grasp at all. By grasping production through ideological and political work, grasping one yields three, grasping three yields nine, and so on, infinitely. In emphasizing politics, leading cadres must also include themselves, reveal their thoughts, and actively transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world. That is to say, "grasping people requires grasping oneself."

I have been stationed in Yuangezhuang for a year. Although I have created some sensational scenes and earned the title of advanced commune, looking back, the work in the first half of the year was largely blind. Only recently have I figured out some of the ways.

When stationed in a village, what should be grasped first? In the past, I focused on production tasks and production progress. As soon as I arrived in the village, I directly grasped production. When the brigade and production team cadres were slow to mobilize the masses, I would get anxious. I would often go to the team that you said was difficult to mobilize myself and stir things up. When the production progress went up, I would organize an on-site meeting to let other brigades learn. This seemed sensational enough, but once you left, things were not the same. You had to grasp everything yourself. If you grasp one, it's one; if you grasp two, it's two; if you don't grasp, it's zero. I was often troubled by this. I secretly complained that the masses were not as highly conscious as the people of Dazhai, and that the grassroots cadres were not up to the task. How to solve this? For a long time, I couldn't figure out a solution. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, I found this way of "grasping people before grasping matters, grasping people requires grasping oneself."

The matter began with the understanding of a cadre.

Not long after I arrived in Yuangezhuang, I developed a bad impression of the Party Branch Secretary, Li Qingrong: while the commune members were actively delivering fertilizer to the team, he secretly sent manure to his private plot; during the drought resistance and seedling protection, their team was close to the water source, while the North Caokou Brigade was far from the water source, and when they were asked to support North Caokou with some water, he refused. From then on, I felt that he was too bad, simply not like a Party Branch Secretary, and I found fault with him in everything. Later, I discovered some more problems with him, and I was very angry. I criticized him at the branch meeting, and then again at the mass meeting. However, the more I criticized him, the more distant he became from me. At this time, I had the idea of ​​removing him from his position as Party Branch Secretary. After study by the commune Party committee, my opinion was agreed, and the county Party committee was informed. At first, I thought this was for the sake of work, for the sake of being responsible for the cause of the Party, and that it was a resolute and vigorous work style. Later, after thinking it over, I felt that this way of doing things was not right. So, according to my old habit, I opened Chairman Mao's works and talked to Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. When I read the last paragraph in "On Practice," the two kinds of understanding in my mind began to clash. Chairman Mao said: "Social development has reached today's era, and the responsibility for correctly understanding the world and transforming the world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party." He also said: "The struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to transform the world includes the task of realizing the following: transforming the objective world and also transforming the subjective world." We must thoroughly transform the entire world, so can't Li Qingrong, a Party member comrade, be transformed? If a Party member comrade cannot be transformed, what's the point of talking about transforming the world? The more I thought about it, the more I realized the error of wanting to abandon Comrade Li Qingrong. At this time, I began to examine my own understanding in light of Chairman Mao's teachings on transforming one's own subjective world. Comrade Li Qingrong has made mistakes, and they are very serious mistakes for a Party Branch Secretary, but he came from a poor brick kiln worker's background, suffered cruel class oppression, and fundamentally loves the Party and the cause of socialism. His mistakes still fall within the scope of help and education, and we should patiently help him understand and correct them. I only know how to criticize all day long, seeing nothing good in others. Isn't this violating Chairman Mao's teaching of looking at comrades with a one-divides-into-two perspective? What else is this if not a simplistic and crude approach? Stationed in a village, if I can't even do a good job of the ideological work of the village's Party Branch Secretary, how can I expect to do a good job of the ideological work of the masses? How can I educate the team cadres to do the ideological and political work of the masses? The root of the problem was found, and my heart was also clear.

The next day, I found Comrade Li Qingrong, sincerely made a self-criticism, put down the airs of a commune secretary, took responsibility for not helping him correct his mistakes in time, and solicited his opinions and criticisms. Then I helped him analyze his mistakes and their root causes. Comrade Li Qingrong remained silent, lowered his head, his face red, and did not say a word. It was not until I was about to leave that he excitedly asked me, "How did you think of examining yourself?" I frankly said, "Chairman Mao criticized me severely in his book. Chairman Mao told me to do this." Who knew that after I left, he opened Chairman Mao's works and began to study, thinking all night long without sleeping. At four o'clock the next morning, before dawn, he ran several miles to knock on my door at the commune. As soon as he entered, he made a self-criticism to me, examining his own individualism and impure Party spirit. He also said, "I originally thought, you don't like me anyway, you wouldn't see me even if I carried a mountain, so I might as well just 'paper over the cracks' and not offend you..."

Recognizing mistakes is the first step, but correcting mistakes is the ultimate goal. I didn't prematurely draw conclusions about what kind of comrade Li Qingrong really was, nor was I satisfied with his self-criticism, let alone my own self-criticism. Instead, I actively and comprehensively paid attention to his actions, analyzed his thoughts, and often had heart-to-heart talks with him, doing meticulous ideological work. I tested him, helped him, and strictly demanded of him in his work. The facts of the past six months have proved that this comrade has changed greatly: he has taken the lead in criticizing the idea of farming only for filling one's stomach or for the benefit of one's own village several times at commune member meetings; in the fight against drought, he took the lead in putting in hard work, leading the commune members to carry water to irrigate the land, not waiting for water or relying on the sky; after the autumn harvest, he also mobilized the commune members to discuss and actively lent 6,000 jin of reserve grain to the severely affected South Caokou Brigade. This spirit of collectivism greatly encouraged the cadres and commune members of the South Caokou Brigade. Because Li Qingrong's work was outstanding, the commune's mobile red flag has not left Yuangezhuang for three months. The above facts fully demonstrate that Comrade Li Qingrong is a good Party Branch Secretary in the commune, both in terms of political consciousness and work ability.

At this time, our commune Party committee launched a heated discussion on the transformation of Li Qingrong and summarized the work of being stationed. Everyone unanimously agreed that being stationed is personal practice, a process of personally exploring the laws of transforming the world. To transform the objective world, we must first transform people. The correct way to be stationed should not be to simply grasp production, but to grasp politics and grasp people, using more than 80 percent of our energy, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, to understand people, educate people, and cultivate people. Grasping people's ideological and political work is like grasping machine manufacturing. If we build a machine, we can produce an incalculable number of products. If we cultivate people with firm political thoughts, the revolution in production will develop at a high speed and sustainably. Grasping production alone yields one if you grasp one, two if you grasp two, and zero if you don't grasp at all. Through ideological and political work to grasp production, grasping one yields three, grasping three yields nine, and so on, infinitely. This is probably the "human factor first" in being stationed. Of course, to complete this task well, we must first transform our subjective world according to Chairman Mao's teachings, so that our understanding conforms to objective laws. This is "grasping people before grasping matters, grasping people requires grasping oneself."

### 抓事先抓人，抓人要抓己

专栏：

    抓事先抓人，抓人要抓己
    编者按：这篇文章的作者，用亲身的经历生动地说明了几个重要问题：领导生产，不能单纯抓生产，不抓人的思想。光抓生产，抓一是一，抓二是二，不抓是零；通过思想政治工作抓生产，抓一是三，抓三是九，以至无限。领导干部在突出政治当中，还必须把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，在改造客观世界的同时，积极改造自己的主观世界。就是说“抓人要抓己”。
    我在袁各庄蹲点一年了。虽然也搞出了几个轰轰烈烈的场面，挂了个先进公社的牌子，但回过头来一看，前半年的工作，盲目性很大，最近才算摸到了一些门路。
    进村蹲点，到底应该先抓什么？过去，我心里想的是生产任务、生产进度，进村就直接抓生产。大队、生产队干部发动群众迟缓，我心里着急，常常是你说那个队难发动，我就亲自到那个队去，乒乓二五，给你轰起来。生产进度上去了，然后组织现场会，让别的大队学习。这样看来也够轰轰烈烈，可是，等你一离开，就不是那个样子了。事事你得去抓，你抓个一，就是个一，你抓个二，就是个二，你不抓，就是个零。我常常为这件事苦恼。暗暗埋怨群众不如大寨人的觉悟高，基层干部不顶事。怎么解决？好长一段时间我想不出办法。学习了毛主席的著作，我才找到了这条“抓事先抓人，抓人要抓己”的门路。
    事情是从对一个干部的认识开始的。
    我到袁各庄蹲点不久，就对支部书记李庆荣产生了一个坏印象：社员都积极向队里投肥，他却偷偷往自留地里送粪；抗旱保苗的时候，他们队离水源近，北曹口大队离水源远，让他们支援北曹口一部分水，他不同意。从那以后，我觉着他太差劲了，简直不象个支部书记的样子，处处不顺眼。后来，又发现他一些问题，我很生气，在支部会上提出批评，后来又在群众大会上提出批评。可是，越批评他越和我疏远。这时候，我产生了撤销他支部书记的念头。经公社党委研究，同意了我的意见，并且向县委备了案。开初，我觉得这是为了工作，为了对党的事业负责，是雷厉风行的作风。后来，我前思后想，觉得这样办不对头。于是，按照老习惯，我打开了毛主席著作，和毛主席说开心里话了。当我读到《实践论》中最后一段的时候，脑子里两种认识就打开架了。毛主席说：“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党肩上。”还说：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造主观世界。”整个世界我们都要彻底改造，李庆荣是个党员同志，就不能改造了吗？一个党员同志都改造不了，还谈什么改造世界？越想越觉着想抛开李庆荣同志的想法的错误。这时，我开始对照毛主席关于改造自己的主观世界的教导，检查自己的认识。李庆荣同志有错误，而且对一个支部书记来说是很严重的错误，但是，他是贫苦的烧窑工人出身，受过残酷的阶级压迫，对党、对社会主义事业，从根本上是热爱的。他的错误仍然属于帮助教育的范围，应该耐心地帮助他认识和改正。自己整天只知批评，看人家一无是处，这不是违背毛主席一分为二地看待同志的教导吗？这不是简单粗暴的做法又是什么？在一个村蹲点，连这个村的支部书记的思想工作都做不好，还怎么设想去做好群众的思想工作？还怎么教育队干部去做群众的思想政治工作？病根找到了，心里也亮堂了。
    第二天，我找了李庆荣同志，真诚地作了自我检查，放下了公社书记的架子，承担起没使他及时改正错误的责任，并征求他的意见和批评，然后帮助他分析错误及其根源。李庆荣同志一直闷着，低头红着脸不说一句话。直到我临走的时候，他才激动地问我：“你怎么想起检查自己来？”我坦率地说：“毛主席在他的书里狠狠地批评了我，是毛主席叫我这样做的。”谁知我走了以后，他就翻开毛主席著作学上了，一边学，一边想，一个晚上都没睡觉。第二天早晨四点钟，天还未明，他就跑了好几里地，来公社敲我的门。进门就向我做检查，检查自己的个人主义，党性不纯，还说：“原来我想，你反正看着我不顺眼，我扛个山来你也看不见，不如干脆‘合稀泥’，不撞你的眼眶子……”。
    认识错误是第一步，改正错误才是最终目的。李庆荣同志到底是怎样一个同志，我并没过早地下结论，没满足他的检查，更没满足自己的检查，而是积极地、从多方面注意他的行动，分析他的思想，经常和他谈心，做细致的思想工作。在工作中考验他，帮助他，严格要求他。半年来的事实证明，这个同志大有变化：他几次在社员大会上带头检查和批判为吃饱肚子、为本村种田的思想；抗旱斗争中，他带头下硬功夫，领导社员担水浇地，不等水，不靠天；秋收以后，他又发动社员讨论，主动把六千斤储备粮借给受灾严重的南曹口大队。这种集体主义精神大大鼓舞了南曹口大队的干部和社员。由于李庆荣的工作做得出色，公社的流动红旗，三个月来没离过袁各庄。以上事实充分说明，李庆荣同志不论在政治觉悟方面还是在工作能力上，都是公社里的一个好支部书记。
    这时候，我们公社党委就李庆荣转变这件事，开展了一次热烈的讨论，总结了蹲点工作。大家一致认为，蹲点是亲自实践，是亲自摸索改造世界规律的过程，要改造客观世界，必须首先改造人。蹲点的正确途径不应该是单抓生产，而应该是抓政治、抓人，用百分之八十以上的精力，以毛泽东思想为指导，去了解人，教育人，培养人。抓人的思想政治工作，就象抓机器制造一样，造出一部机器，就能生产出无法计算的产品，培养出政治思想过硬的人，生产革命就会高速度地、持续地开展起来。单抓生产，抓一是一，抓二是二，不抓是零。通过思想政治工作去抓生产，抓一是三，抓三是九，以至无限。这大概就是蹲点当中的“人的因素第一”吧。当然，要很好地完成这一任务，首先必须按照毛主席的教导，改造主观世界，使自己的认识符合客观规律。这就是“抓事先抓人，抓人要抓己。”
