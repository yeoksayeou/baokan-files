    Putting Ideological Work First
    ——How Changshu County Grasped Ideology Vigorously in Seizing High Yields of Grain and Cotton
    Last year, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, achieved high yields of both grain and cotton, making a double contribution to the state. The county's nearly 200,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 141 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the 750,000+ mu of grain fields averaged 990 jin of grain per mu. In addition, the 90,000+ mu of rapeseed fields averaged 204 jin of rapeseed per mu. Not only were the grain, cotton, and oil crop procurement quotas overfulfilled, but the collective retention of reserve grain and the food rations distributed to commune members were also increased compared to the previous year.
        The Key Lies in the Spirit
    The most important experience of Changshu County in achieving high yields of both grain and cotton is that leaders took the lead, promoting progress at all levels, extensively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, breaking down complacency, and establishing the idea of continuous revolution.
    From 1962 onwards, Changshu County's grain and cotton production increased year after year. After the autumn harvest of 1964, the people of the county were overjoyed. However, when discussing grain and cotton production for 1965, two different opinions emerged: Some people believed that the current foundation was good, the potential was great, and as long as they advanced victoriously, continued the revolution, learned from advanced experiences, and caught up with the advanced, they could climb to new peaks of high grain and cotton yields; others were complacent, burdened by thoughts of pride and self-satisfaction, looking only backward and not forward, wanting only to maintain the status quo and not to strive for more. Some people in high-yield areas thought: "After three consecutive years of good harvests, all our strength has been used up, all methods have been exhausted, and all potential has been tapped. It's impossible to increase grain and cotton production any further." Some people in mid-yield areas thought: "Now we have enough to eat, wear, and use. As long as we can maintain this level for a long time, we'll be content." Some people in low-yield areas thought: "If the high-yield areas increase by 100 jin every year, and we also increase by 100 jin every year, we can account for ourselves to both our superiors and subordinates."
    The county Party committee promptly grasped this ideological trend and believed that to achieve high yields of both grain and cotton, it was necessary to reverse this mental state in a timely manner. At the same time, it was believed that to solve this ideological problem, it was first necessary to solve the ideological problems of leaders at all levels, especially the members of the county Party committee.
    Therefore, in the winter of 1964, the members of the county Party committee concentrated on studying the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao on opposing pride, complacency, and stagnation, and comprehensively analyzed the county's agricultural production situation from the perspective of "one divides into two." They saw that although there had been consecutive years of good harvests, grain yields were not as good as Jiading in the east or Wuxi in the west; cotton yields were not as good as Cixi in the south or Qidong in the north. In particular, in comparison with Qidong County, which also had high yields of both grain and cotton, they felt that although both were concentrated cotton-producing counties, both had more than one mu of land per person, and both had the same climatic and production conditions, why was cotton production lower than Qidong? The county Party committee made a serious comparison and unanimously felt that it was because their dedication to farming for the revolution and scientific farming were not as good as Qidong, and first and foremost, the county Party committee's spirit of continuous revolution was not as good as Qidong's.
    The comparison was very shocking. The members of the county Party committee consciously criticized their own complacency and resolved to take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, using Chairman Mao's thorough revolutionary and continuous revolutionary thought to arm their own minds and the minds of leading cadres at all levels. The standing committee of the county Party committee established a central study group, and combined with the actual ideological situation of each period, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. When the county Party committee and commune Party committees deployed, inspected, and summarized production and work, they first deployed, inspected, and summarized the study, experience, and problems of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, every time they held a meeting of commune Party committee secretaries, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's articles according to the content of the meeting, with problems in mind, and in light of ideological considerations. Communes, brigades, and production teams followed suit. In order to make the study more effective for grassroots cadres and the masses, each brigade established Mao Zedong Thought study groups with the Party and Youth League branches as the core. There were more than 5,500 study groups in the county, with more than 80,000 Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and activists participating in the study. At the same time, more than 17,000 propagandists and storytellers were trained to explain Chairman Mao's works or quotations and tell revolutionary stories at brigade clubs and during field labor breaks.
              Fight the Ideological Battle First
    Changshu County's practice proves that to be proactive in production, one must first be proactive in ideological work. What does it mean to be proactive? The Changshu County Party Committee has two concise and vivid formulations: Put ideological work first, and solve ideological problems in the bud.
    In order to grasp the ideological trends of the masses in each period in a timely and accurate manner, last year, many leading cadres in Changshu County often went deep into the front line of production to live and work with the masses, grasp the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and grasp ideological and political work. Many active thoughts among grassroots cadres and commune members were grasped in this way in a timely manner.
    The county Party committee deeply realized that the most powerful weapon to win the initiative in ideological battles is Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of grain and cotton production in 1965, leaders at all levels promptly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant works in response to the active thoughts that emerged among cadres and commune members in each period, achieving immediate results.
    In winter, when summing up the production experience of 1964 from top to bottom, in response to the complacent, complacent, and top-level pride of some people, the county Party committee leaders promptly organized cadres at all levels and the broad masses throughout the county to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and launched a nationwide discussion on "For Whom Do We Farm?" They guided everyone to recall and compare the old and new societies and the two different purposes of farming, so that everyone realized that farming now is not only for food, clothing, and use, but more importantly, to support national construction and support the world revolution, so that everyone's ideological awareness was greatly improved. Many people said that if we don't understand that farming is for the revolution, people will lose energy and fields will lose production, and even the advanced will become backward; if we understand that farming is for the revolution, our vision will be broader, our enthusiasm will be greater, and our confidence in striving for high yields of both grain and cotton will be stronger.
    In summer, before and after cotton sowing, the weather was cold and rainy, which affected emergence, and some cadres and commune members in cotton-growing areas showed anxiety and fear of difficulties. The Party committees of the cotton-growing communes organized the study of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," established the idea that we must despise difficulties strategically and overcome all difficulties to win victory, and carried out activities to resist disasters and protect seedlings, and finally achieved the victory of early seedlings, full seedlings, and strong seedlings.
    During the summer harvest and planting season, due to the delayed maturity of wheat and the increase in the area of late rice, the contradiction between season and quality, and between tasks and labor, was quite prominent, and some cadres developed a fear of difficulties. The entire county studied "Concentrate a Superior Force to Destroy the Enemy One by One" from top to bottom, fully prepared material resources, and rationally arranged labor. As a result, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was high, the wheat was harvested quickly, the late rice was planted in a timely manner, and the field management of cotton was well done.
    The victory of the summer harvest and planting season made some cadres complacent again. They lacked sufficient ideological preparation for the possible difficulties in striving for a good autumn harvest. In response to this idea, the county Party committee organized cadres and the masses throughout the county to study the two articles "Unite the Whole Party and Strive to Fulfill the Party's Tasks" and "Continue to Maintain the Style of Hard Struggle," used the viewpoint of "one divides into two," and carried out summary and evaluation activities to find reasons and tap potential. Some cadres said: "If we find shortcomings after winning a battle, we will not be overwhelmed by victory; if we present problems after making achievements, we will not be complacent." Some people said: "Looking back and comparing with the past, the achievements are not small; looking forward and comparing with the advanced, the gap is very large." Through the study of these two articles, the ideology was corrected, and the tasks and measures for autumn harvest production were further implemented.
          Learn from, Catch Up With, and Surpass the Advanced
    In summarizing and evaluating production in 1964, Changshu County selected pacesetters at the county, commune, and brigade levels. Advanced banners were established throughout the county in terms of rice, wheat, cotton, and improving production conditions. After the pacesetters were established, they mobilized the surrounding communes and teams to compare gaps, find reasons, and tap potential, and carried out activities to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced. At the same time, last year, the county Party committee organized commune cadres and a small number of top teams to visit and study in Qidong, Wuxi, Jiading, Cixi, and other places, to learn from others' strengths and make up for their own weaknesses.
    Visiting and studying and summarizing and evaluating promoted the ideological revolutionization of leaders at all levels and the broad masses of cadres. Some high-yield units felt after visiting other places that they were just "oxen in a herd of elephants, a little brother," and there was nothing to be proud of. Some mid-yield units felt compared to high-yield units that "there are pacesetters ahead and pursuers behind," and the situation was pressing, and the idea of being in the middle was dangerous. Some low-yield units reflected after several visits and studies: "There are advanced banners outside and high-yield pacesetters inside, and we will definitely be able to jump out of our own circle and achieve high yields of both grain and cotton."
    The reason why Changshu County's mutual learning activities were both lively and effective was mainly because they highlighted Mao Zedong Thought. In several activities organized by the county Party committee to visit other places, they paid attention to grasping the active thoughts of the visitors, and studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a living way in light of the actual ideological situation. In April last year, when visiting the suburbs of Shanghai, some comrades did not bring problems and humbly learn from others' strengths, but only compared themselves with others' material conditions and did not talk about the revolutionary spirit, saying: "Other people's production is good, but it is not possible to learn from it and do it." In response to this ideological problem, we organized everyone to study the article "Get Rid of the Burden and Start the Machine." After studying and checking, the attitude of learning from the advanced was corrected, and the harvest of learning was even greater.
    In the year since Changshu County launched the "learn from the advanced" campaign, many new high-yield units have emerged. In rice and cotton production, 62 production teams and 58 production teams respectively had average yields per mu exceeding the pacesetters of 1964, and in wheat production, 45 production teams had average yields per mu approaching the pacesetters of 1964.
    Recently, the Changshu County Party Committee summarized the production and work of 1965 from the perspective of "one divides into two." They felt that although the total output of grain and cotton had increased compared to the previous year, the increase was not large enough, the rice yield was even lower than the previous year, and diversified operations were still a weak link; they paid attention to grasping the active thoughts in the struggle for production, but they did not grasp the active thoughts in the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads enough. Compared with fraternal counties in work and production, they were still far from enough. The county Party committee believes that the gap in work and production is first and foremost a gap in ideology, and what stands out is the gap in the revolutionization of the ideological style of the county Party committee leadership. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, the county Party committee leadership consciously examined their thoughts and work, and resolved to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example in future work, continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly use Chairman Mao's thorough revolutionary and continuous revolutionary thoughts to arm the minds of leaders at all levels and the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and win new victories.

### 思想工作做在前头——常熟县在夺取粮棉双高产中如何抓活思想

    思想工作做在前头
    ——常熟县在夺取粮棉双高产中如何抓活思想
    江苏省常熟县去年获得粮棉双高产，对国家作出双贡献。全县近二十万亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一百四十一斤；七十五万多亩粮田，平均亩产粮食九百九十斤。此外，九万多亩油菜田，平均亩产菜籽二百零四斤。不仅超额完成了粮棉油交售任务，集体提留的储备粮和分配给社员的口粮，也都比上一年有所增加。
        关键是精神状态
    常熟县所以能够实现粮棉双高产，一条最重要的经验是：领导带头，层层带动，大学大用、活学活用毛主席思想，破骄傲自满情绪，立不断革命思想。
    从一九六二年起，常熟县粮棉连年增产。一九六四年秋季丰收以后，全县人民欢欣鼓舞。但是，在议论一九六五年粮棉生产的时候，却出现了两种不同的意见：一部分人认为，现在基础很好，潜力很大，只要乘胜前进，不断革命，学先进、赶先进，就能攀登粮棉双高产的新高峰；一部分人则心满意足，认为增产已经到顶，背上骄傲自满的思想包袱，只向后看，不向前看，只想保，不想跳。高产地区有些人认为：“连续三年丰收，力气用尽，办法使尽，潜力挖尽，粮棉再要增产不行了。”中产地区有些人认为：“现在有吃，有穿，有用，只要能长久保持这个水平，就心满意足了。”低产地区有些人认为：“高产地区年年增一百，我们同样年年增一百，对上、对下都交代得过去了。”
    县委及时掌握了这个思想动向，认为要实现粮棉双高产，必须及时扭转这种精神状态。同时，认为要解决这一思想问题，首先必须解决各级领导的思想问题，特别是县委领导成员的思想问题。
    于是，在一九六四年冬天，县委成员集中学习了中央和毛主席有关反对骄傲自满、故步自封的指示，以一分为二的观点，全面分析了全县农业生产形势，看到了虽然连年丰收，但粮食产量，东不如嘉定，西不如无锡；棉花产量，南不如慈溪，北不如启东。特别是对照了粮棉双高产的启东县，感到同样是集中产棉县，同样是每人一亩多田，同样的气候条件和生产条件，但是棉花产量为什么却低于启东？县委认真作了对比，一致感到是由于为革命种田、科学种田不如启东，而首先是县委领导的不断革命精神不如启东。
    经过对比，震动很大。县委成员自觉地批判了自己的自满思想，决心带头活学活用毛主席著作，以毛主席的彻底革命、不断革命思想来武装自己的头脑、武装各级领导干部的头脑。县委常委建立了中心学习小组，结合每个时期的思想实际，活学活用毛主席著作。县委、公社党委在部署、检查、总结生产和工作时，都首先部署、检查、总结毛主席著作的学习情况、经验和问题。同时，每次召开公社党委书记会议，都根据会议的内容，带着问题，针对思想，组织大家学习毛主席文章，公社、大队和生产队也跟着这样做。为了使基层干部和群众学得更有成效，各个大队以党、团支部为核心，建立毛主席著作学习小组。全县共有学习小组五千五百多个，参加学习的党、团员和干部、群众积极分子有八万多人。同时，培训了一万七千多名宣传员、故事员，在大队俱乐部和利用田间劳动休息时间，讲解毛主席著作或语录，讲革命故事。
              先打思想仗
    常熟县的实践证明，要生产上着着主动，首先要思想工作上着着主动。什么叫主动？常熟县委有两句简明、生动的提法，就是：思想工作做在前头，思想问题解决在苗头。
    为了及时、准确地掌握群众每个时期的思想动向，去年常熟县许多领导干部经常深入到生产第一线去，跟群众生活、劳动在一起，抓毛主席著作的学习，抓思想政治工作。基层干部和社员中的许多活思想，就是这样及时抓起来的。
    县委深深体会到：要打胜思想上的主动仗，最强大的武器就是毛泽东思想。在一九六五年的粮棉生产过程中，各级领导针对每个时期干部、社员中出现的活思想，及时组织大家学习毛主席的有关著作，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    冬天，在上上下下总结一九六四年生产经验时，针对一些人的心满意足、增产到顶的骄傲自满思想，县委领导上及时组织全县各级干部和广大群众，大学毛主席《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，开展了“为谁种田”的全民大讨论。引导大家回忆对比新旧两个社会，两种不同种田的目的，使大家认识到，现在种田不单是为了吃穿用，更重要的是为了支援国家建设，支援世界革命，使大家思想觉悟大大提高。许多人说，不明种田为革命，人脱劲，田脱产，先进也要变后进；懂得种田为革命，眼光越看越远，干劲越来越大，争取粮棉双丰收信心越来越强。
    夏季，棉花播种前后，天气低温多雨，影响出苗，棉区一些干部和社员出现了焦急畏难情绪。棉区各公社党委就组织学习《愚公移山》，确立了必须在战略上藐视困难，排除万难，去争取胜利的思想，开展抗灾保苗活动，终于取得了早苗、全苗、壮苗的胜利。
    夏收夏种期间，由于麦子成熟期推迟，晚稻面积增多，季节与质量、任务与劳力之间矛盾相当突出，一部分干部又产生了畏难情绪。全县从上到下学习了《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》，充分做好物质准备，合理安排劳力。结果，干部群众热情高涨，麦子收得很快，晚稻种得适时，棉花田间管理搞得好。
    夏收夏种的胜利，又使一部分干部麻痹起来，他们对争取秋熟丰收中可能遇到的困难问题，缺乏足够的思想准备。针对这个思想，县委又组织全县干部、群众学习了《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》、《继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风》这两篇文章，运用一分为二的观点，开展总结评比活动，找原因、挖潜力。有的干部说：“打了胜仗找缺点，就不会被胜利冲昏头脑；有了成绩摆问题，就不会故步自封。”有人说：“向后看，比过去，成绩不小；向前看，比先进，差距很远。”通过这两篇文章的学习，思想对了头，秋熟生产的任务和措施都进一步落实下来。
          学赶超先进
    常熟县在总结评比一九六四年生产中，县、公社、大队三级都评出了标兵。全县范围内在水稻、麦子、棉花和改善生产条件等方面，都树立了先进旗帜。标兵树起来以后，就发动周围社队比差距、找原因、挖潜力，开展学、赶、超先进的活动。同时，县委去年又几次组织公社和少数尖子队干部，到启东、无锡、嘉定、慈溪等地参观学习，取人之长，补己之短。
    参观学习和总结评比，促进了各级领导和广大干部的思想革命化。一些高产单位到外地一看，感到自己不过是“大象群里的黄牛，是个小弟弟”，没有什么值得骄傲的地方。一些中产单位跟高产单位一比，觉得“前有标兵，后有追兵”，形势逼人，中游思想危险。一些低产单位经过几次参观学习，反映说：“外有先进旗帜，内有高产尖子，一定能跳出自己的圈子，实现粮棉双高产。”
    常熟县的相互学习活动所以搞得既热火又有成效，主要原因是突出了毛泽东思想。县委在几次组织去外地参观的活动中，都注意抓参观人员的活思想，针对思想实际，活学活用毛主席著作。去年四月份到上海市郊区参观，有些同志不是带着问题，虚心向人家的长处学习，而是只跟人家比物质条件，不讲革命精神，说什么：“人家生产好是好，就是学不象，做不到”。针对这一思想问题，就组织大家学习《放下包袱，开动机器》一文。一学一查，学先进的态度端正了，学习的收获也就更大了。
    常熟县在开展学先进活动一年来，又涌现了许多新的高产单位。在水稻和棉花生产上，全县分别有六十二个生产队和五十八个生产队平均亩产量超过了一九六四年的标兵，在麦子生产上，也有四十五个生产队平均亩产量接近一九六四年的标兵。
    最近，常熟县委以一分为二的观点，总结了一九六五年的生产和工作。感到粮棉总产量虽比上一年有所增加，但增产幅度不够大，水稻产量还比上一年低了一些，多种经营仍然是个薄弱的环节；注意抓生产斗争中的活思想，但对阶级斗争、两条道路斗争中的活思想抓得不够。在工作上、生产上与兄弟县相比，还很不够。县委认为，工作上和生产上的差距，首先是思想上的差距，突出的是县委领导上思想作风革命化方面的差距。县委领导学习毛主席的指示后，自觉地检查了思想和工作，决心在今后工作中，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断地以毛主席的彻底革命、不断革命的思想，来武装各级领导和广大干部、群众的思想，夺取新的胜利。
