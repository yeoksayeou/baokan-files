    Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Discuss Communist Morality
    Compiled by the Editorial Department of "Philosophical Research"
    Foreword
    Since humanity entered class society, there has only been class morality in the world; there is no such thing as supra-class, general morality. The proletarian communist morality is fundamentally opposed to the morality of all exploiting classes.
    Proletarian revolutionaries demand of themselves to serve the people wholeheartedly, to serve the revolution wholeheartedly, and to possess what Chairman Mao said was "the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self," which is the fundamental principle of proletarian communist morality. Chairman Mao said: "Starting from this point, one can become a person of great benefit to the people. A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has shed vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." Only the interests and goals of the Party, the people, and communism, along with "the spirit of utter selflessness," are the starting point for the proletariat's attitude towards suffering and happiness, life and death, and are the criteria for the proletariat to evaluate right and wrong, good and evil.
    The proletarian communist morality is gradually formed in revolutionary practice, in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and in the process of breaking down all old moral concepts.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, have creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, greatly changed their spiritual outlook, and developed communist moral qualities. Among them have emerged a large number of new people with noble communist moral qualities. In their diaries, articles, and words and deeds are contained many profound thoughts, shining with the brilliance of communist morality. We have excerpted some materials from newspapers and periodicals about workers, peasants, and soldiers discussing communist morality and published them here for everyone to study and research.
    Comrade Wu Han promotes a moral theory that the proletariat must inherit the morality of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, otherwise it would be "creating" its own morality out of thin air, which is impossible. He wants to "apply to today" the morality of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, such as loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, the bourgeoisie's "making money by all means," Mencius's spirit of the "great man," and Hai Rui's "unyielding integrity," as "component parts" of communist morality. Comrades, please compare Comrade Wu Han's views with the views of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and think about it and discuss it: Is Comrade Wu Han right, or are the workers, peasants, and soldiers right? What exactly is the nature of Comrade Wu Han's moral outlook? When the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, strengthening their communist moral cultivation, and thoroughly breaking with all old moral concepts, what exactly is Comrade Wu Han promoting his moral theory for?
    I. Listen to Chairman Mao's words, establish "the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self," and be a noble, pure, and moral person.
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Bethune's communist spirit of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self" and to be a moral person.
    Bourgeois morality proceeds from extreme egoism and is extremely selfish and self-interested. To establish proletarian morality, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly break down bourgeois moral concepts, and then have "the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self." The formation of communist moral qualities in the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the result of listening to Chairman Mao's words, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and thoroughly breaking down all old moral concepts in revolutionary practice. They say: "The most fundamental thing" is "to arm one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought and squeeze out all selfish thoughts remaining in one's mind."
    "How to live, for whom to live"
    After studying Volumes I, II, III, and IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," what I feel most deeply is that I have understood how to live, for whom to live…
    I think that making myself live is to make others live better.
    I want to take Comrades Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, and Fang Zhimin as examples and be a person who loves the motherland, loves the people, and is forever loyal to the Party and the people's revolutionary cause. (Lei Feng's Diary)
    How should people study to be human? What kind of person should they be? Through studying "Serve the People," I deeply realize that: Being human is to be a Lei Feng-style person with communist morality who serves the people wholeheartedly. (Wang Jie's Diary)
     "Living is not for eating, living is to serve the people wholeheartedly"
    "People live to eat…" I think this statement is wrong. We eat to live, but living is not for eating. I live to serve the people wholeheartedly, to fight for the cause of human liberation—communism.
                                          (Lei Feng's Diary)
    When the interests of the people are in your heart, you consider your personal business and tiredness less… I think: To contribute your strength for the interests of the people is to live meaningfully.
    To truly and thoroughly serve the people, you must first have the idea of loving the people and have the people in your heart. When I think this way, I feel uncomfortable if I don't care about the interests of the people and can't serve the people well. I feel happy when I can work for the interests of the people.
    We who are alive should think of the interests of the people as Chairman Mao said. We must not be afraid of criticism and must correct our mistakes for the interests of the people. We must live as heavy as Mount Tai and not as light as a feather.
    In dealing with personal family and daily life issues, the most important thing is to put revolutionary interests first.
    (Chen Lanhua, Director of the Women's Congress of Xishuyuan Brigade, Shuyuan Commune, Junan County, Shandong)
    "Completely" and "thoroughly" are like two rulers. By measuring with these two rulers, you can know what is wrong in your thinking and what problems there are in your work. After that, I often use these two rulers to measure myself. Whether it is a big job or a small job, it should be completed according to this high standard.
    Where is my foothold for serving the people? It should be based on every comrade, doing a good job of cooking and taking care of everyone's life. I should warmly care for comrades who are cold and hungry.
    Constantly compare myself with the two "extremes," and correct problems immediately, which makes our revolutionary family warmer and stronger.
    These two "extremes" have become my constant direction of effort and are my two mirrors. Only by constantly looking at myself with these two mirrors can I continuously improve my thinking and do my work better. (Sun Leyi, Quartermaster of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army)
    A person's life is limited, but serving the people is unlimited. I want to devote my limited life to the unlimited "serving the people."
                                            (Lei Feng's Diary)
    Mao Zedong Thought is the basis for being human
    Mao Zedong Thought is my basis for being human, the soul of my life, the source of my strength, the pointer of my actions, the weapon of my struggle, and the foundation of my revolution. In a word, it is impossible to carry out the revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works.
    Do it until old, learn until old, and make my life a life of revolution, a life of serving the people, and a life of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.
                          (Liao Chujiang, Instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army)
    To better dedicate one's limited life to the Party's cause and contribute to socialist construction, the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's works well, to arm one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, to squeeze out all selfish thoughts remaining in one's mind, so that one can be thoroughly revolutionized, so that one will not take the wrong path in life, and so that one can truly learn the ability to serve the people.
                (Li Suwen, Salesperson at Heping Non-Staple Food Store, Shenyang)
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Eighth Route Army, the People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers… they did not work for grain distribution, nor for money distribution, nor for work points. They worked hard, and many people blocked gun holes with their bodies at critical moments for the victory of a battle. Where did this revolutionary spirit and self-sacrificing spirit come from? It came from Mao Zedong Thought.
                        (Chen Yonggui, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade)
    To serve the people honestly, to be a good servant of the people, to complete the work tasks assigned by the Party, there is no other trick or shortcut, the only thing is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and always strive to be a good fighter of Chairman Mao. (Wang Jie's Diary)
    Noble qualities come from noble thoughts, and noble thoughts come from Chairman Mao's teachings. Mao Zedong Thought will take root in the minds of the Chinese people, will take root in the minds of the people of the world, and will take root in the minds of future generations.
                                (Zhang Hongchi, D慶 Five-Good Pacesetter)
     II. Conscious Labor, Selfless Labor
    Editor's Note: Labor is glorious, and not laboring is shameful, is the criterion of communist morality; "despising labor and loving leisure," "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," are the moral standards of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and the two are diametrically opposed. Chairman Mao taught us to "become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness." Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "We must give laborers, especially those labor heroes and inventors who have made significant inventions and creations in their labor, the glory they deserve, and give those social parasites who do nothing and eat without working the contempt they deserve. This is one of the standards of our new morality." The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres, in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, consciously labor and selflessly labor for the revolution, and "always be an ordinary laborer"!
    "Labor is glorious, and not laboring is shameful"
    In the dozen years since liberation, my thinking has improved several times. When I was first liberated, I wanted to work hard to repay the great kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. Later, under the education of the Party, I understood that it was not enough to just know how to repay the kindness, but I had to serve the people well and strive for the liberation of the exploited and oppressed class brothers all over the world and the realization of communism.
    Labor is glorious, and not laboring is shameful. All work is doing revolution and is an indispensable part of the people. Our excrement collection is also needed by the people.
    Our work is a bit dirty and a bit tiring, but if it is done well, the residents will not be dirty or smelly and will be clean. We are dirty and tired, but we bring a good environment to millions of people, so the dirtier and more tired we are, the more glorious we are.
            (Shi Chuanxiang, Excrement Removal Worker of the Cleaning Team of Chongwen District, Beijing)
    When we think that the grain, vegetables, fruits, meat, cotton, etc., that we produce with our own hands are eaten and worn by the hard-working worker brothers; eaten and worn by the People's Liberation Army soldiers who are guarding the front lines of national defense day and night; eaten and worn by the scientists who are climbing the peak of science and creating new miracles for the people; eaten and worn by the engineers of the human soul and the educators who are carefully cultivating the next generation; eaten and worn by all those who participate in the socialist revolution and construction, we feel that we are engaged in the most glorious and heroic revolutionary work.
              (Zhang Chunyu, Liutuan Brigade, Liutuan Commune, Yanshou County, Heilongjiang)
    When I saw that the cesspool in the toilet was full, I immediately started to take out the excrement. Although I sacrificed my morning's rest time, the toilet was very clean. People jokingly called me a excrement man. I think it is very glorious to be a excrement man. Wasn't Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, who participated in the Beijing Heroes' Conference in 1959, a excrement worker? How fortunate would I be if I could be such a excrement man! (Lei Feng's Diary)
    Labor is not for "wages" or "rewards," but "for the revolution" and "to add bricks and tiles to the communist building"
    Someone once asked me how much I earn a month. When he found out that I earn the same salary as him, he was very surprised and didn't understand why I was working harder and harder in my labor. The reason is very simple. I have been educated in the revolutionary history of the Party, and I have inherited the working class's hatred for the old society. I feel that if I don't take the lead in labor, I will feel uneasy and can't sleep well. Can a worker's labor be completely controlled by the amount of wages? Can it only depend on how much bonus is received?… Taking the initiative to lead in labor is not to be an advanced producer, let alone to win a reward, but to fulfill a worker's responsibility and to do my best to work for the Party.
                            (Zhao Mengtao, National Advanced Producer)
    We are farming now to make revolution, to eliminate poverty and blankness, to eliminate low production, to eliminate capitalism, to eliminate the three major differences (the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor), and to directly serve the construction of socialism and the future realization of communism… We are adding bricks and tiles to our country's revolutionary cause and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.
              (Zhang Keming, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch of Bowang Brigade, Hejin County, Shanxi)
    Some people say that we workers just go to work and get off work every day… This can't be considered doing revolution. Only fighting enemies with real swords and guns is considered doing revolution. I don't think this is right. The People's Liberation Army is doing revolution, and we workers are also doing revolution. I work in an iron and steel plant. We produce more iron, produce good iron, and refine good steel. This is hitting the enemy, this is revolution. We use our brains more in production, think of more ways, and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, also for the sake of revolution. (Meng Tai, National Labor Model)
    "Revolutionary work has no distinction between high and low"
    Whatever is beneficial to the people is noble, and whatever harms the interests of the people is lowly. Revolutionary work is all work that is beneficial to the people, so revolutionary work has no distinction between high and low. However, people's thoughts do have distinctions between high and low. Serving the people wholeheartedly, being utterly selfless, and being devoted to others are noble thoughts; coveting ease and comfort, pursuing enjoyment, and harming others to benefit oneself are lowly thoughts. In our socialist society, there are only unpromising people, not unpromising jobs. At the same time, the question of what is high and low is class-based, and different classes have different views. (Li Suwen, Salesperson at Heping Non-Staple Food Store, Shenyang)
    I gradually realized from Chairman Mao's teachings that ordinariness and extraordinariness, greatness and ungreatness, are not determined by the work position itself, but by whether we have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and whether we have the revolutionary spirit of sacrificing personal interests and even lives without hesitation for the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    In our socialist country, there is no work that is "inferior to others," only thoughts that are "inferior to others."
    The work of a salesperson seems very ordinary, but its relationship with production and people's lives is so close that socialist construction cannot be separated from it for a moment. The small counter also has a broad world. I have now deeply fallen in love with this line of work, and I am determined to stand at the counter for the revolution for the rest of my life.
    (Xia Meiyan, Salesperson at the Seventh Branch of the Linfen Sugar, Tobacco, and Wine Company, Shanxi)
                "Always be an ordinary laborer"
    In the future, I must learn from Wang Jie's revolutionary spirit of daring to take on heavy burdens and demanding myself to a high standard, abandon all personal distractions, and promote ideological revolutionization. In my work, I must always maintain the true qualities of a worker, always be an ordinary laborer, and work with all the workers in the factory to build our factory into a revolutionary textile enterprise. (Hao Jianxiu, National Labor Model)
    Is it idealess for a high school student to return to his hometown to participate in agricultural production? Is it "burying" talent? No! Absolutely not. Using revolutionary spirit to create a new world in the countryside, seeking benefits for millions of people, and contributing strength to the country's prosperity, is this not a lofty ideal? Of course, going from high school to university can learn more knowledge, and in the future, one may become an expert or scientist and make contributions to the country's socialist construction. But these people should also be laborers. They cannot be separated from ordinary labor and cannot be separated from the workers and peasants; if they break away from labor, break away from the masses, and break away from the needs of the country to pursue some ideal, that is a personal plan and cannot be said to be a lofty ideal.
            (Wang Jingzhang, Educated Youth Peasant of Dajin Commune, Hongan County, Hubei)
    I want to stay at the bottom, stay among the working people, and be an ordinary laborer, creating the world with my own hands. Labor is like a touchstone, testing everyone.
                                (Educated Youth Peasant Dong Jia Geng)
              III. Revolutionary Collectivism
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said: "The highest criterion for all words and deeds of Communists must be that they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by the broadest masses of the people." The interests of the people and the interests of the Party are higher than everything else. The collectivist spirit of revolution first, collective first, and others first is the highest principle of proletarian communist morality. Proletarian collectivism is fundamentally opposed to bourgeois individualism. To establish proletarian collectivism, we must break down bourgeois individualism. In the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers constantly overcome bourgeois individualism and consciously use the proletarian collectivist spirit as the criterion for their moral cultivation.
          "There is no personal liberation without class liberation"
    Under the education of the Party, the broad working people armed with Mao Zedong Thought all understand that there is no personal liberation without class liberation. Not for one's own interests, but selfless and public-minded, they can completely understand and do it.
          (Cheng Dewang, Advanced Producer and Youth Tricycle Worker in Shanghai)
    We are the working class, and our words and deeds cannot be separated from the class. Do not speak without leaving the class, and do not act without leaving the class.
                (Liu Kun, Veteran Worker of Zhuzhou Tianxin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant)
              "Consciously put the interests of the Party first"
    A Communist Party member must consciously put the interests of the Party first at all times. When personal interests conflict with the interests of the Party, they must unconditionally subordinate personal interests to the interests of the Party.
              (Zhi Shunyi, Close Comrade-in-Arms of Dong Cunrui and Special-Class Combat Hero)
    For the Party, I am not afraid of going to a mountain of knives or a sea of fire; for the Party, I am willing to be crushed to pieces. (Wang Jie's Diary)
    For the benefit of the Party, no matter if it is a deep mountain or a dense forest, or a border area of ​​an island, wherever it is difficult, wherever I need to work, I will go there. I will never covet enjoyment and comfort because of retirement. (Zhang Hongchi, D慶 Five-Good Pacesetter)
    Without the Party, without the collective, there is nothing of me. What I have belongs to the Party and the collective. I want to dedicate everything to the Party.
            (Wang Chuanhe, Feeder of Haoyi Brigade, Chengxi Commune, Linyi, Shanxi)
            "Have a spirit of self-sacrifice for the collective"
    The spirit of self-sacrifice is always needed, not only on the battlefield, not only in the fierce revolutionary struggle, but also in a peaceful environment, in daily work and life. The spirit of self-sacrifice is the spirit of serving the revolution and the people wholeheartedly. We must have this spirit at all times to do our work well. (Li Suwen, Salesperson at Heping Non-Staple Food Store, Shenyang)
    We know that revolutionaries always put the interests of the Party and the people first. No matter when or under what circumstances, as long as it is needed by the Party and the people, he will work hard to do it. When personal interests conflict with the interests of the Party and the people, he will consciously sacrifice personal interests (even sacrifice personal life) and obey the interests of the Party and the people. This spirit is the communist spirit. With this spirit, at the critical moment when the interests of the Party and the people are threatened, he can put his personal life and death aside and step forward to defend the interests of the Party and the people.
                                    (Xiao Lewen, Five-Good Soldier)
                Be a Screw That Never Rusts
    The role of a person for the revolutionary cause is like a screw on a machine. The machine is a solid whole because it is connected and fixed by many screws. It can operate freely and exert its great working ability. Although the screw is small, its role is inestimable. I am willing to be a screw forever. Screws need to be maintained and cleaned regularly so they don't rust. The same is true of people's thoughts, which need to be checked regularly so that they don't go wrong. (Lei Feng's Diary)
    In the future, I want to be a "universal screw" in my work. Wherever the Party screws me, I will be there, never rusting and shining brightly. (Wang Jie's Diary)
    I want to be like a universal screw, whether screwed on a gun, screwed on a farm tool, screwed on a car, a machine, or a pot table… Wherever it is screwed on is beneficial to the Party, and it will play the role of a small screw.
                                (Zhang Hongchi, D慶 Five-Good Pacesetter)
            IV. Have the Motherland in Mind and Have the World in View
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said: "We are internationalists, and we are also patriots." He also said: "People who have won the revolution should help the struggle of people who are striving for liberation. This is our internationalist obligation." The patriotism we are talking about is loving the socialist motherland. Our internationalism is proletarian internationalism, which is internationalism that firmly opposes narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism. The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "Have the Motherland in Mind and Have the World in View." They work actively, work selflessly, fight resolutely, and wholeheartedly "serve the entire Chinese people and serve the people of the world," embodying noble communist moral qualities.
                  "Fight to the death" for the motherland
    The revolutionary predecessors laid down the country for us. I want to use practical actions to defend and build her… For the sake of the Party and the motherland, for the sake of the people, I will work hard for one day as long as I have one day of life. I can endure everything that is unbearable. For the sake of the Party and the motherland, for the sake of the people, I am determined to work hard to the death! Fight to the death! (Wang Jie's Diary)
    We must be loyal to the country, the revolution, and the people. Personal interests must be subordinate to the collective and revolutionary interests… As long as it is beneficial to the revolution and the people of the motherland, we must fight to the end.
                        (Mai Xiande, Mechanic of the "Maritime Hero Boat")
            "Care for state property more than your own things"
    Our country is led by the Communist Party, and the people are in charge. I am a worker, so I have to look like a master of the house. I often say to my fellow boatmen, the boat is our home, and we must take care of the boat like we take care of our new clothes. It hurts in my heart wherever there is a hole. The boat is loaded with state property, and we must take care of state property more than our own things. Without today's country, where would our happiness come from? We must always think that there is a country before there is a home. (Zheng Peiliang, Captain of the Jianglun Wooden Boat Transportation Cooperative, Yingshan County, Sichuan)
    Caring for state property and the safety of the people's lives is more important than caring for your own life… (Lei Feng's Diary)
    I have always believed that the blast furnace is my home, and the factory is closer than my home. In 1953, the planes of the U.S. imperialism often came to disturb Anshan. I moved my luggage from my home to the blast furnace. Every time a plane came, I would put a pipe wrench in my waist and carry a large iron rod in my hand, and stand in the middle of the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces. At that time, I didn't think about anything, I just wanted to guard my blast furnace and defend my blast furnace. Although I didn't go to the Korean front, I was also resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and that was also revolution!… If you only think about making money yourself and don't care about the collective, how can production be improved, how can the country be prosperous, and how can your personal life be truly improved!
                (Meng Tai, National Labor Model)
      Cannot forget that "two-thirds of the world's
            Poor people have not been liberated"
    A revolutionary fighter should not only stand in the company and see the whole country, but also see the whole world. At present, two-thirds of the working people in the world have not been liberated, and they are still living in extreme poverty. Therefore, even if our lives are good, we must never forget them.
            (Liao Chujiang, Instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army)
      "Eating well, dressing well, living well, and playing well is happiness," and "working for money, paid according to labor, doing more for more money, doing less for less money." This is the "small calculation" of a very few individualists.
    Our proletarian revolutionary fighters "calculate" completely different "accounts." We often calculate the "bitter accounts" of class brothers, not forgetting the past; calculate the "enemy situation accounts" of the activities of enemies at home and abroad, increasing vigilance; calculate the "big accounts of the revolution" of the 600 million people, diligently building and defending the socialist cause… Revolutionary fighters "live in the company and watch the world," often talking about "two-thirds of the world's poor people have not been liberated," and we "serve the people wholeheartedly and fight for the cause of human liberation—communism." This is our revolutionaries' "account book."
                  (Gao Mao, a PLA Unit)
    Although we are eating better and dressing better than before, this fully reflects the superiority of our country's socialist system. However, in the world, there are still many working people who are oppressed. They are still not eating well, not dressing well, and even naked. We still have the obligation to help them and support them so that they can live as happily as we do.
        (Jiang Jiayu, Electric Motor Repairman of the Power Plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company)
    We cannot control the affairs of the village in the old society, but we should also care about the major events of the world in the new society. Imperialism and revisionism are causing trouble, and I will shave my beard and work harder to fight them. Our country exploded an atomic bomb, and I was so happy that I could not sleep for two nights. Chairman Mao told us to establish patriotism and internationalism. We are farmers who are led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. We should hold a hoe and think about revolution, stand at the door of our house, see Beijing, and think about the suffering people all over the world.
  (Wang Changfu, Chairman of the Poor Peasants' Association of Wule Production Brigade, Yangjingdi Commune, Pingshun County, Shanxi)
    If a revolutionary looks down on his work, cannot connect his job with the great revolutionary cause like Wang Jie, and always think of the 650 million people in the country and that two-thirds of the people in the world have not been liberated, then there is no point in serving the people completely and thoroughly.
                (Huang Guobao, Driver of the Storage and Transportation Station of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Jianli County, Hubei)
    Don't be afraid! Imperialism scolds us, revisionism restricts us, and we must stand up straight and work hard! The Chinese people must have the hard-boned spirit of the Chinese people.
    We want to make revolution, and we want to liberate all the oppressed people in the world who have not been liberated. What's so great about going to bed two hours later and sweating a few more times? We want to support the oppressed nations and people.
                              (Wang Jinxi, "Iron Man" of D慶)
            V. Hate the Enemy and Love the People
    Editor's Note: Hating the enemy and loving the people is the manifestation of communist morality. Chairman Mao said: "There is absolutely no such thing as love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason. As for the so-called 'love of humanity', there has never been such a unified love since mankind differentiated into classes... We cannot love the enemy, we cannot love the ugly phenomena of society, and our purpose is to eliminate these things." He also said:
  "First, we must be ruthless to the enemy, we must overwhelm it, and we must eliminate it; second, we must be kind, united, and harmonious to our own people, to the people, to comrades, to superiors, and to subordinates." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers follow Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class hatred. They say: We must love the people and hate the enemy. "Without 'hate', we cannot be 'ruthless'. The deeper the hatred, the more ruthless we are."
              Be ruthless to the enemy and be loyal and honest to the people
    Lu Xun's two lines of poetry have taught me a lot. I am determined to follow Lu Xun's two lines of poetry:
              "Fierce-browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers,
          Head-bowed, I gladly serve the children."
    Be ruthless to the enemy and be as cruel as winter. Be loyal and honest to the Party and the people, always loyal to the Party and the people, and be a docile tool of the Party and the people.
                                            (Lei Feng's Diary)
    Treat comrades with the warmth of spring,
    Treat work with the heat of summer,
    Treat individualism like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves,
    Treat the enemy like the ruthless winter. (Lei Feng's Diary)
                You must "hate" the enemy in order to be "ruthless"
    To be ruthless to the enemy, to have red eyes when you see the enemy, to rush up with a bayonet and stab the enemy to death, you must arouse class hatred. Without "hate", you cannot be "ruthless". The deeper the hatred, the more ruthless you are… Concentrate your hatred on the tip of the bayonet and the head of the bullet, stabbing the enemy and shooting at the enemy… Even if you run out of ammunition and food, you must be like the warriors in "Who Are the Most Lovable People", with the enemy's brains on the body of the grenade and the enemy's ears in your mouth. (Guo Xingfu, Company Commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army)
    "Be unshakable in the face of class enemies and resolutely fight against monsters and demons"
    To make revolution, you must have the spirit of daring to fight against the enemy. Since I joined the revolutionary struggle, I have always been a thorn in the enemy's side, and they hate me with bulging eyes. But I am not afraid. I remember that on the sixteenth day of the first month of 1936, the revolutionary guerrillas were scattered by the enemy, and I and some comrades were arrested. At first, the enemy wanted to lure me to surrender, and I shouted: "Resolutely overthrow the reactionaries!" The enemy beat me viciously, cut me with bayonets, forced me to kneel on the red-hot bricks, and also used the cruel punishment of stepping on the lever to harm me, forcing me to expose the revolutionary organization. I didn't say a word, and the angry enemy pushed up the bullets and threatened me with shooting. I thought to myself: If you are determined to make revolution, are you still afraid of being shot?! I remained unyielding. The enemy had no choice but to hang me on a tree. Later, I was rescued by the masses and escaped from the tiger's mouth. After liberation, I actively participated in land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and was again opposed by the enemy. They cursed me secretly and plotted to harm me, but I was unshakable and resolutely fought against monsters and demons, and won the victory together with the masses.
        (Zeng Yansong, Director of the Women's Congress of Yanjiang Brigade, Shaping Commune, Yizhang, Hunan)
    Be ready to destroy invading enemies at any time.
    I will definitely contribute all my strength, even my life. As long as I am still breathing, I will fight on and never submit to the enemy, and resolutely liberate the suffering working people. (Mai Xiande, Mechanic of the "Maritime Hero Boat")
                    Do not forget class struggle
    The enemy is not sleeping, but sharpening its knives, and still wants to make a comeback.
    At present, imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism are staging an anti-China chorus. I am a revolutionary fighter holding a gun, and I cannot be paralyzed in the slightest. I must increase my vigilance a hundredfold, establish the idea of ​​serving the troops for a long time, and work hard to prepare for battle, ready to smash all new conspiracies of the enemy at any time. (Wang Jie's Diary)
    Today's good days did not come easily! How many revolutionary comrades have sacrificed themselves? Which mountain does not have the blood shed by our comrades! Which mountain does not have the bone dregs of our comrades!… Our revolutionary achievements and today's good days are what these comrades exchanged for their lives. Now, if we who are alive do not work hard, how can we be worthy of them? Furthermore, there are still imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in the world, and the landlords and rich peasants who have not been reformed in the country are not reconciled. This group of bad guys all want to ride on our heads again, so we must not forget the class or slack off! This year I am sixty years old, and as long as I have one breath left, I will fight to the end! The older I get, the more I have to seize every minute and second and rush to take on heavy burdens. For the revolution, I am willing to go to a mountain of knives, jump into a sea of ​​fire, and risk my old life.
                (Li Jinyu, Director of Jiancun Credit Cooperative, Cangshan County, Shandong)
    In my mind, I have memorized class struggle. We cannot let go of this class struggle at all, and we must never forget our roots, and we must fight for a lifetime and fight to the end.
    If we are slightly careless or doze off

    工农兵谈共产主义道德
    《哲学研究》编辑部编
    前言
    自从人类进入阶级社会以来，世界上就只有阶级的道德，没有什么超阶级的、一般的道德。无产阶级的共产主义道德同一切剥削阶级的道德是根本对立的。
    无产阶级革命者要求自己全心全意为人民，全心全意为革命，要求自己具有象毛主席所说的“毫不利己专门利人的精神”，这是无产阶级共产主义道德的根本准则。毛主席说：“从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”只有党的、人民的、共产主义的利益和目的，“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，是无产阶级对待苦与乐、生与死的出发点，是无产阶级评价是非、善恶的准则。
    无产阶级的共产主义道德，是在革命的实践中，在学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的过程中逐步形成的，是在破除一切旧道德观念的斗争过程中形成的。
    我国广大工农兵群众，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的三大革命运动中，活学活用毛主席著作，大大地改变了精神面貌，发扬了共产主义的道德品质。在他们中间涌现出大批具有高尚的共产主义道德品质的新人。在他们的日记、文章和言行中，包含着许多深刻的思想，闪烁着共产主义道德的光辉。我们从报刊上摘录了工农兵谈共产主义道德的一部分材料，发表在这里，供大家学习和研究。
    吴晗同志宣扬这样一种道德论，说无产阶级必须继承地主阶级和资产阶级的道德，否则就是“凭空创造”自己的道德，那是不可能的。他要把地主阶级的、资产阶级的道德，什么忠孝节义，礼义廉耻啦，什么资产阶级的“多方赚钱”啦，什么孟轲的“大丈夫”精神啦，什么海瑞的“刚直不阿”啦，“移用在今天”，作为共产主义道德的“组成部分”。请同志们把吴晗同志的观点和工农兵的观点对照一下，想一想，议一议：究竟是吴晗同志对呢，还是工农兵对呢？吴晗同志的道德观究竟是什么货色呢？在广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作、加强自己的共产主义道德修养，同一切旧道德观念彻底决裂的时候，吴晗同志宣扬他的道德论，究竟是为了什么呢？
    一、听毛主席的话，树立“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，做一个高尚的、纯粹的、有道德的人
    编者按：毛主席教导我们，学习白求恩“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义精神，做一个有道德的人。
    资产阶级道德是从极端利己主义出发的，是极端自私自利的道德，要树立无产阶级道德就必须以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底破除资产阶级道德观念，才能具有“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。工农兵群众的共产主义道德品质的形成，都是在革命的实践中，听毛主席的话，活学活用毛主席著作，大破一切旧道德观念的结果。他们说：“最根本的一条”，就是“用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，挤出残存在头脑中的一切私念”。
    “怎样做人，为谁活着”
    我学习了《毛泽东选集》一、二、三、四卷以后，感受最深的是，懂得了怎样做人，为谁活着……。
    我觉得要使自己活着，就是为了使别人过得更美好。
    我要以黄继光、董存瑞、方志敏等同志为榜样，做一个热爱祖国、热爱人民，永远忠于党、忠于人民革命事业的人。（雷锋日记）
    人活着要怎样学习做人？做什么样的人？通过学习《为人民服务》，我深刻认识到：做人就是做一个雷锋式的、具有共产主义道德、全心全意为人民服务的人。　（王杰日记）
     “活着不是为了吃饭，活着是为了全心全意为人民服务”
    “人活着就是为了吃饭……”，我觉得这种说法不对，我们吃饭是为了活着，可活着不是为了吃饭。我活着是为了全心全意为人民服务，是为人类的解放事业——共产主义而斗争。
                                          （雷锋日记）
    心里有了人民的利益，个人的忙、累，就考虑得少了。……我觉得：为了人民的利益，把自己的力量贡献出来，才算活的有意义。
    要真正做到彻底为人民服务，得先有爱人民的思想，心里要有人民。我这么一想，就觉得不关心人民的利益，不能好好为人民服务，心里就不好受。能为人民的利益去工作，就感到高兴。
    咱们活着的人，应该象毛主席说的那样，为人民利益着想。不能怕别人批评，要为人民的利益而改正错误。要活的象泰山重，不能象鸿毛那么轻。
    在处理个人家庭和日常生活问题上，最要紧的，是得把革命利益摆在第一位。
    （山东莒南县书院公社西书院大队妇代会主任　陈兰花）
    “完全”和“彻底”就象两把尺子一样，用这两把尺子一量，就知道思想上还有什么不对头的地方，工作上有什么问题。在这以后，我常用这两把尺子来衡量自己，不管是大工作还是小工作，都应该按照这个高标准去完成。
    我为人民服务的落脚点在哪？应该落脚在每一个同志的身上，干好烧火做饭的事，管好大家的生活。我应该热忱关怀挨冷受冻的同志。
    用两个“极端”经常对照自己，有了问题就马上改正，这就使我们革命大家庭更加温暖，更加有力量。
    这两个“极端”，成了我经常努力的方向，是我的两面镜子。经常用这两面镜子照照自己，才能使思想不断进步，工作做得更好。　（解放军济南部队某部司务长　孙乐义）
    人的生命是有限的，可是，为人民服务是无限的，我要把有限的生命，投入到无限的“为人民服务”之中去。
                                            （雷锋日记）
    毛泽东思想是做人的依据
    毛泽东思想是我做人的依据，生命的灵魂，力量的源泉，行动的指针，战斗的武器，革命的根本。一句话，干革命不学毛主席著作不行。
    做到老，学到老，使自己的一生，成为革命的一生，为人民服务的一生，学习和运用毛泽东思想的一生。
                          （解放军某部指导员　廖初江）
    要想把自己有限的一生更好地献给党的事业，贡献给社会主义建设事业，最根本的一条，就是要很好地学习毛主席著作，就是要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，挤出残存在自己头脑中的一切私念，使自己彻底革命化，这样才不会走错人生的路途，才能真正学到为人民服务的本领。
                （沈阳市和平副食品商店营业员　李素文）
    抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争时期，八路军、解放军、人民志愿军，……，他们一不为分粮，二不为分钱，三不为工分，拼着命地干，不少人在紧要关头，为了一个战斗的胜利，用自己的身躯去堵枪眼。这种革命精神，自我牺牲的精神，是从哪里来的呢？是来自毛泽东思想。
                        （大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵）
    要老老实实的为人民服务，当好人民的勤务员，完成党交给的工作任务，没有别的窍门或捷径，唯一的只有读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，永远争做毛主席的好战士。　（王杰日记）
    高尚的品质来源于高尚的思想，高尚的思想来源于毛主席的教导。毛泽东思想将在我们中国人头脑里扎根，将在世界人民头脑里扎根，而且将在子孙万代头脑里扎根。
                                （大庆五好标兵　张洪池）
     二、自觉劳动、忘我劳动
    编者按：劳动光荣，不劳动可耻，是共产主义道德的准则；“好逸恶劳”，“劳心者治人、劳力者治于人”，是地主和资产阶级的道德标准，二者是针锋相对的。毛主席教导我们要“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。刘少奇同志说：“我们必须给劳动者、特别是那些在劳动事业中有重大发明和创造的劳动英雄们和发明家们以应得的光荣，而给那些无所事事、不劳而食的社会寄生虫以应得的贱视。这就是我们的新道德的标准之一。”广大工农兵群众和干部，遵照毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志的教导，为革命而自觉劳动、忘我劳动，“永远做一个普通劳动者”！
    “劳动是光荣的，不劳动是可耻的”
    解放十几年来，我的思想有过几次大提高。刚解放时，我一心好好干，想报答党和毛主席的大恩。后来，在党的教育下，才懂得光知道报恩不行，要好好为人民服务，为解放全世界受剥削、受压迫的阶级弟兄和实现共产主义而奋斗。
    劳动是光荣的，不劳动是可耻的。什么工作都是干革命，都是人民不可缺少的一部分，我们掏大粪也是人民的需要。
    我们的工作是脏一点、累一点，但是搞好了，居民就会不脏不臭，干干净净。我们一人脏累，却给千百万人带来好的环境，所以我们越脏越累越光荣。
            （北京市崇文区清洁队粪便清除工人　时传祥）
    当我们想到，我们亲手生产出来的粮食、蔬菜、瓜果、肉类、棉花等，被辛辛苦苦劳动的工人兄弟吃上了、穿上了；被日夜坚守在国防前线的解放军战士吃上了、穿上了；被为攀登科学高峰、为人民创造新奇迹的科学家吃上了、穿上了；被人类灵魂的工程师、精心培养下一代的教育工作者吃上了、穿上了；被一切参加社会主义革命和建设的人们吃上了、穿上了，我们就感到自己是在从事着一件最光荣、最豪迈的革命工作。
              （黑龙江延寿县六团公社六团大队　张春雨）
    我看到厕所的粪池满了，立即动手把大粪掏出来，虽然牺牲了自己一上午的休息时间，但是厕所里弄得很干净。人家开玩笑地说我是一个大粪夫。我觉得当一个大粪夫是非常光荣的。一九五九年参加北京群英会的时传祥同志，不就是一个掏大粪的工人么？我要是能够当一个这样的大粪夫，那该多荣幸啊！　（雷锋日记）
    劳动不是为“工资”、“奖励”，而是“为革命”、“为共产主义大楼添砖瓦”
    曾有人问我一个月拿多少工资。当他发现我和他拿的工资一样，就表示很奇怪，不了解为什么我在劳动中越干越起劲。道理说穿了很简单，我受了党的革命历史的教育，我继承了工人阶级仇恨旧社会的感情。我觉得如果自己不好好带头劳动，就会感到良心不安，睡不好觉。一个工人劳动得好坏，难道能完全受工资多少支配？难道能只看拿多少奖金？……自己积极带头劳动，不是为了当个先进生产者，更不是为争得一份奖励，而是要尽到一个工人的责任，要尽最大努力为党工作。
                            （全国先进生产者　赵梦桃）
    我们现在种田，就是在革一穷二白的命，革低产的命，革资本主义的命，革三大差别（城乡之间、工农之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别）的命，直接为建设社会主义和将来实现共产主义服务。……是在为我国的革命事业和全世界人民的革命事业添砖和瓦。
              （山西河津县伯王大队团支部书记　张克敏）
    有人说，我们工人每天上班下班不过是干干活，……这不能算是干革命，只有真刀实枪地同敌人打仗才算干革命。我看这个不对头。解放军是干革命的，我们工人也是干革命的。我在炼铁厂工作，我们多出铁，出好铁，炼好钢，这就是打击敌人，这就是革命。我们在生产上多用脑筋，多想办法，搞技术革新技术革命，也是为了革命。（全国劳动模范　孟　泰）
    “革命工作没有高低贵贱之分”
    凡是有利于人民的，就是高尚的，如果是损害人民利益的，就是低贱的。革命工作都是有利于人民的工作，因此，革命工作没有高低贵贱之分。但是，人的思想却有高低贵贱之分。全心全意为人民服务，毫不利己，专门利人，就是高尚的思想；贪图安逸，追求享受，损人利己就是低贱的思想。在我们的社会主义社会里，只有没出息的人，没有没出息的工作。同时，看待什么是高低贵贱的问题，是有阶级性的，不同的阶级有不同的看法。　（沈阳市和平副食品商店营业员
　李素文）
    我从毛主席的教导中逐渐认识到，平凡与不平凡，伟大与不伟大，并不决定于工作岗位本身，而是决定于我们自己有没有全心全意为人民服务的思想，有没有为无产阶级革命事业，毫不犹豫地牺牲个人利益甚至生命的革命气概。
    在我们社会主义国家里，没有“低人一等”的工作，只有“低人一等”的思想。
    售货员的工作，看来很平凡，但是它跟生产和人们生活的关系是这样的密切，社会主义建设事业，一刻也离不开它。小小的柜台，同样有广阔的天地。我现在已经深深地爱上了这一行，我决心为革命站一辈子柜台。
    （山西省临汾糖业烟酒公司第七门市部营业员　夏美岩）
                “永远做一个普通劳动者”
    今后我一定要学习王杰那种勇于挑重担、以高标准要求自己的革命精神，抛开一切个人杂念，促进思想革命化。在工作上我要永远保持工人的本色，永远做一个普通劳动者，和全厂职工一起，为把我们的工厂办成一个革命化的纺织企业而奋斗。　（全国劳动模范　郝建秀）
    一个高中生回乡参加农业生产，是没有理想，是“埋没”人材吗？不！绝对不。用革命精神，去创造农村新的天地，为千万人谋福利，为祖国富强贡献力量，这难道不是远大的理想吗？当然，从高中进大学，能学到更多的知识，将来可能当上专家、科学家，对祖国的社会主义建设能做出贡献。但这些人也应该是劳动者，他们也离不了平凡的劳动，离不了工农群众；如果脱离劳动、脱离群众、脱离国家需要，去追求什么理想，那就是个人打算，不能说是有远大理想。
            （湖北红安县大金公社知识青年农民　王敬璋）
    我要留在底层，留在劳动人民中间，作一个普通的劳动者，用双手创造世界。劳动象试金石一样考验着每一个人。
                                （知识青年农民　董加耕）
              三、革命的集体主义
    编者按：毛主席说：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”人民的利益、党的利益高于一切，革命第一、集体第一、他人第一的集体主义精神，是无产阶级共产主义道德的最高原则。无产阶级的集体主义是同资产阶级的个人主义根本对立的。要立无产阶级的集体主义，就要破资产阶级的个人主义。广大工农兵群众，在活学活用毛主席著作中，不断地克服资产阶级的个人主义，自觉地用无产阶级的集体主义精神作为自己道德品质修养的准则。
          “没有阶级的解放就没有个人的解放”
    在党的教育下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大劳动人民，都懂得没有阶级的解放就没有个人的解放。不为一己利益，大公无私，他们是完全想得通、做得到的。
          （上海市先进生产者、青年三轮车工人　程德旺）
    我们是工人阶级，一言一行都不能离开阶级，离开阶级不讲话，离开阶级不行动。
                （株洲田心机车车辆工厂老工人　刘　昆）
              “自觉地把党的利益摆在首位”
    一个共产党员，任何时候都要自觉地把党的利益摆在首位，当个人利益和党的利益发生矛盾的时候，要无条件地把个人利益服从党的利益。
              （董存瑞亲密战友、特等战斗英雄　郅顺义）
    为了党，我不怕进刀山入火海，为了党，那怕粉身碎骨我也心甘情愿。　（王杰日记）
    为了党的利益，不管是深山密林，不管是海岛边疆，哪里艰苦，哪里需要我去工作，我就到那里去。我决不因为退伍而去贪图享受安逸。　（大庆五好标兵　张洪池）
    没有党，没有集体，就没有我的一切，我的就是党的、集体的，我要把一切献给党。
            （山西临猗城西公社好义大队饲养员　王传河）
            为集体要有“自我牺牲的精神”
    自我牺牲精神永远需要，不仅在战场上需要，在激烈的革命斗争中需要，而且在和平的环境里，在日常的工作生活中，也同样需要。自我牺牲的精神，也就是一心一意地为革命、为人民服务的精神，在任何时候都要有这样一种精神，才能把工作做好。　（沈阳市和平副食品商店营业员　李素文）
    我们知道，革命者总是把党和人民的利益放在第一位的，无论在什么时候，什么情况下，只要是党和人民所需要的，他就会努力去干。当个人利益一旦与党和人民的利益发生矛盾的时候，他就会自觉地牺牲个人利益（甚至牺牲个人的生命），服从党和人民的利益。这种精神，才是共产主义精神。有了这种精神，在党和人民的利益遭到威胁的紧急关头，他就能置个人生死于度外，挺身而出，捍卫党和人民的利益。
                                    （五好战士　肖乐文）
                做一个永不生锈的螺丝钉
    一个人的作用，对于革命事业来说，就如一架机器上的一颗螺丝钉。机器由于有许许多多的螺丝钉的联接和固定，才成了一个坚实的整体，才能够运转自如，发挥它巨大的工作能力。螺丝钉虽小，其作用是不可估计的。我愿永远做一个螺丝钉。螺丝钉要经常保养和清洗，才不会生锈。人的思想也是这样，要经常检查，才不会出毛病。　（雷锋日记）
    今后在工作中要做一个“万能螺丝钉”，党把我拧在那里，就在那里，永不生锈，闪闪发光。　（王杰日记）
    我要象个万能的螺丝钉一样，拧在枪杆上也行，拧在农具上也行，拧在汽车上、机器上、锅台上……凡是拧在对党有利的地方都行，都要起一个小螺丝钉的作用。
                                （大庆五好标兵　张洪池）
            四、心怀祖国，放眼世界
    编者按：毛主席说：“我们是国际主义者，我们又是爱国主义者”。又说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们所讲的爱国是爱社会主义的祖国。我们的国际主义是无产阶级的国际主义，是坚决反对狭隘的民族主义和狭隘爱国主义的国际主义。工农兵群众遵照毛主席的教导，“心怀祖国，放眼世界”。他们积极工作，忘我劳动，坚决斗争，全心全意“为全中国人民，为全世界人民服务。”体现了高尚的共产主义道德品质。
                  为祖国“奋斗到死”
    革命前辈为我们打下了江山，我要用实际行动来保卫她、建设她；……为了党和祖国，为了人民，我有一天的生命，就努力工作一天。一切难以忍受的我都能忍受下去，为了党和祖国，为了人民，我坚决努力到死！奋斗到死！（王杰日记）
    我们必须忠心为国家、革命、人民，个人利益服从集体、革命利益，……只要对革命、对祖国人民有益，一定奋斗到底。
                        （“海上英雄艇”轮机兵　麦贤得）
            “爱护国家财产要胜过自己的东西”
    我们的国家是共产党领导，是人民当家，我是个工人，就得象个当家作主的样子。我常向船工同志们说，船就是我们的家，爱护船要象爱护自己的新衣服一样，哪里挂个洞，心里都痛木了。船上装的是国家的东西，爱护国家财产要胜过自己的东西。没有今天的国家，哪有我们的幸福？要随时想到有国才有家。　（四川营山县江轮木船运输合作社驾长　郑培亮）
    爱护国家的财产和人民的生命安全，要比爱护自己的生命为重……。　（雷锋日记）
    我一直认为，高炉就是我的家，厂子比我的家还亲。一九五三年，美帝国主义的飞机常来骚乱鞍山，我把行李卷从家里搬到高炉，每次飞机一来，我就腰里掖把管钳子，手里提条大铁棍，往一、二高炉中间一站。那时，我什么也没想，就想守着我的高炉，保卫我的高炉。虽说我没去朝鲜前线，可我那也是抗美援朝嘛，那也是革命嘛！……如果光想着自己挣钱，不关心集体，那生产怎么能搞好，国家怎么能富强，你个人的生活又怎么能真正改善呢！
                （全国劳动模范　孟　泰）
      不能忘记“世界上还有三分之二的
            穷人没有得到解放”
    一个革命战士，不仅要站在连队，看到全国，而且还要看到全世界。目前，世界上还有三分之二的劳苦大众没有得到解放，他们还过着极端贫困的生活。因此，即使我们的生活好了，也决不应该忘记了他们。
            （解放军某部指导员　廖初江）
      “吃得好，穿得好，住得好，玩得好，才是幸福”、“干活拿钱，按酬付劳，钱多多干，钱少少干”。这是极少数个人主义者打的“小九九”。
    我们无产阶级革命战士“算”的是完全不同的“账”。我们经常算着阶级兄弟的“苦情账”，不忘过去；算着国内外敌人活动的“敌情账”，提高警惕；算着六亿人民“革命的大账”，勤勤恳恳地建设和保卫社会主义事业……。革命战士“身居连队，眼看全球”，常念叨着“世界上还有三分之二的穷人没有得到解放”，我们
  “是为了全心全意为人民服务，是为人类的解放事业——共产主义而斗争”。这就是我们革命者的“账本”。
                  （解放军某部　高　懋）
    我们虽然比以前吃得好了，穿得好了，这充分体现了我国社会主义制度的优越性。但是，在世界上，还有很多劳动人民受压迫，他们还吃不好，穿不好，甚至赤身裸体，我们还有义务，去帮助他们，支援他们，使他们也能和我们一样幸福生活。
        （石景山钢铁公司动力总厂电机修
          理工　姜加禹）
    旧社会村里的事咱也管不着，新社会天下大事咱也应该关心。帝国主义、修正主义捣乱，我剃了胡子加劲干和他斗争。咱们国家爆炸了原子弹，我高兴得两夜睡不着。毛主席叫咱树立爱国主义、国际主义思想，咱是毛主席、共产党领导下的种地人，应该手拿?头心想革命，站到家门口，看到北京城，想到全世界的受苦人。
  （山西平顺县羊井底公社吾乐生产大队贫协主任　王长富）
    一个革命者如果看不起自己的工作，不能象王杰那样把本职工作和伟大的革命事业联系起来，时刻想到全国六亿五千万人，时刻想到世界上还有三分之二的人没有解放，就谈不上完全彻底地为人民服务。
                （湖北监利县供销社储运站司机　黄国保）
    不怕！帝国主义骂我们，修正主义卡我们，我们就要挺起腰杆，鼓起干劲来干！中国人民，就要有中国人民的硬骨头劲才行。
    我们就是要革命，就是要把全世界还没有得解放的被压迫人民解放出来。晚睡两个钟头，多出几身汗嘛，有什么了不起的。我们就是要支援被压迫的民族和人民。
                              （大庆“铁人”　王进喜）
            五、憎恨敌人，热爱人民
    编者按：憎恨敌人，热爱人民是共产主义道德的表现。毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。至于所谓‘人类之爱’，自从人类分化成为阶级以后，就没有过这种统一的爱。……我们不能爱敌人，不能爱社会的丑恶现象，我们的目的是消灭这些东西。”又说：
  “第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”广大工农兵遵照毛主席的教导，永远不忘阶级仇。他们说：对人民要爱，对敌人要恨，“不‘恨’就不能‘狠’，恨的越深就越狠”。
              对敌人耍狠，对人民要忠诚老实
    鲁迅的两句诗对我教育很深，我坚决要按照鲁迅的那两句诗去做：
              “横眉冷对千夫指，
          俯首甘为孺子牛。”
    对敌人要狠，要象严冬一样残酷无情。对党、对人民要忠诚老实，永远忠于党，忠于人民，做党和人民的驯服工具。
                                            （雷锋日记）
    对待同志要象春天般的温暖，
    对待工作要象夏天一样的火热，
    对待个人主义要象秋风扫落叶一样，
    对待敌人要象严冬一样残酷无情。　（雷锋日记）
                对敌人要“恨”才能“狠”
    要做到对敌人狠，一见敌人就眼红，端着刺刀就能冲上去把敌人刺死，就一定要激发阶级仇恨。不“恨”就不能“狠”，恨得越深就越狠。……要把仇恨集中到刺刀尖上，子弹头上，刺向敌人，射向敌人；……即使打到弹尽粮绝，也要象《谁是最可爱的人》中那些勇士一样，手榴弹弹体上有敌人的脑浆，嘴里有敌人的耳朵。　（解放军某部连长　郭兴福）
    在阶级敌人面前“毫不动摇，坚决同牛鬼蛇神作斗争”
    干革命，就是要有敢于同敌人斗争的精神。我自从参加革命斗争后，一直是敌人的眼中钉，他们恨我恨得鼓眼暴睛。但我不怕，记得一九三六年正月十六日那天，革命游击队被敌人打散了，我和一些同志被捕。开始，敌人想引诱我投降，我大喊：“坚决打倒反动派！”敌人就毒打我，用刺刀砍我，逼我跪在烧得火红的砖上，还用踩杠子的毒刑残害我，强迫我暴露革命组织。我一言不发，气得敌人推上枪弹，用枪毙来威胁我。我心想：有心干革命，还怕弹穿身？！我仍然坚强不屈。敌人无可奈何，把我吊在树上。后来，经过群众搭救，脱离虎口。解放后，我积极参加土地改革和镇压反革命等运动，又遭到了敌人的反对。他们暗中咒骂我，谋害我，但我毫不动摇，坚决同牛鬼蛇神作斗争，和群众一道取得了胜利。
        （湖南宜章沙坪公社沿江大队妇代会主任　曾炎宋）
    随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。
    我一定贡献自己的一切力量，甚至生命。只要我的气还在喘着，我一定斗争下去，决不在敌人面前屈服，坚决解放受苦受难的劳动人民。　（“海上英雄艇”轮机兵　麦贤得）
                    不要忘记阶级斗争
    敌人没有睡觉，而在磨刀，还想卷土重来。
    目前，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义正在演出反华大合唱，我是一个手握枪杆的革命战士，丝毫不能麻痹，我一定百倍提高警惕，树立长期为部队服务的思想，努力做好战斗准备，随时准备粉碎敌人的一切新阴谋。　（王杰日记）
    今天的好日子来得不易啊！有多少革命同志牺牲了，哪个山上没有咱同志们淌的血！哪个山上没有咱同志的骨头渣！……咱革命的胜利果实和今天的好日子，就是这些同志拿命拼来的。如今咱活着的人要不好生干，怎么能对得住他们？再想想，世界上还有帝国主义、修正主义和反动派，国内没改造好的地主、富农还不死心。这一伙坏蛋都想再骑在咱们的头上，可不能忘了阶级、松了劲啊！今年我六十岁了，只要还有一口气，也要拼到底！越老越要争分夺秒，抢重担子挑。为了革命上刀山，跳火海，豁上老命，我也甘心情愿。
                （山东省苍山县涧村信用社主任　李金玉）
    我这个脑瓜子里头，把阶级斗争记死了。这个阶级斗争啊，一点也不能放过去，永远也不能忘本，要斗争一辈子，斗争到底。
    对这个阶级斗争，要是脑瓜里稍微有点马虎、稍微打个盹就不行。这五年我就是这样，我就相信党、相信群众、相信自己，错误思想要让我逮住，就抓住不放，就要斗。对党不利的话不说，对党不利的事不做，坚决拥护党，坚决跟毛主席走。阶级斗争永远也不忘，坚决不能忘，要永远记住旧社会的苦，要记着新社会的甜，还要时刻想到全世界还有三分之二被压迫人民。干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，斗争一辈子。
                              （大庆“铁人”　王进喜）
            六、吃苦在前，享受在后
    编者按：毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。那些地方的工作是很艰苦的。艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”遵照毛主席的教导，工农兵群众高度发扬了自力更生、艰苦奋斗、不怕困难、不怕苦，吃苦在前、享受在后的共产主义精神。大庆精神，大寨精神就是这种革命精神。
                “斗争才是真正的幸福”
    通过毛主席著作学习，我懂得了革命就是我的理想，斗争才是真正的幸福。　（王杰日记）
    有人说：人生在世，吃好、穿好、玩好是最幸福的。
    我觉得人生在世，只有勤劳，奋发图强，用自己的双手创造财富，为人类的解放事业——共产主义贡献自己的一切，这才是最幸福的。　（雷锋日记）
    幸福是有阶级性的，我们无产阶级的幸福，就是建设社会主义，实现共产主义，使全世界被压迫的人民彻底解放。这些实现了，幸福才有保证，才是牢固的。
                          （沈阳纺织厂老工人　胡玉琴）
      “幸福总是和为人民服务的工作联系在一起的”
    幸福总是和为人民服务的工作联系在一起的，全心全意为人民服务，就会得到无穷的乐趣。
    一九五九年三月，在和越境的六个匪徒搏斗的紧要关头，我所想到的只是自己死也要保护住钱箱里的五万多元钱，这是国家和人民的财产呀。虽然我的双手被万恶的匪徒砍去了，这看来也许是最大的不幸，但是我感到以自己的斗争来维护国家财产和党的利益，却是我最大的幸福。在我受伤以后，不知有多少阶级兄妹的鲜血输送给我。当这些充满革命情谊的热血，流遍我全身的时候，我觉得浑身都充满了力量，享受到人间的最大幸福。
    每当我克服一个困难，学会做一件事情的时候，我感到一个没有双手的人，能重新为党工作，这是多么幸福的事啊。
    人们有各种不同的人生观，不过归根到底只有两种：一种是为自己，一种是为人民。一切为了个人的“幸福”，都是资产阶级个人主义的卑劣的表现。我们革命青年如果沉迷于物质享受，就会丧失革命斗志，从而毁灭自己。我们应当向雷锋同志学习，全心全意地为人民服务，为了党的事业不懈地工作，乃至献出自己最宝贵的生命。　（女英雄　徐学惠）
      “一九五八年由于一次偶然事故，使我遭到了严重的烫伤，全身烧伤面积达百分之八十九点三，生命处于死亡的边缘，可是，当时我并没有过多的想到个人的安危，我想的只是如何才能早日恢复健康，回到炼钢炉前，参加夺钢战斗。”“我想，一个人革命不革命，决定在一个人的思想，自己身体固然有点残废，只要思想不生锈，我就能革命。”“曾有一些‘好心人’对我讲：‘老邱啊！这下你可在家享享福了，反正不干工作照样可以拿工资，家中又有爱人服侍你！’……但是，作为一个共产党员，一个革命者来说，这种‘满足’是可耻的。”“两年来，我重新和工人同志们在一起，为祖国的钢铁工业进行着战斗，每当做完一件工作的时候，我就感到高兴，感到这就是我最大的幸福。”　（上海第三钢铁厂　邱财康）
                  “自力更生，克服困难”
    我们这个钻井大队，从一开始就参加了大庆油田建设。在这五个年头里，我们走的是一条向困难作顽强斗争、奋勇前进的道路。同天斗，战胜了冬季的严寒和夏天的连天大雨，井越打越快，越打越多；同地斗，战胜了复杂地层，把井打好；同人的错误思想斗，战胜了城乡资本主义自发势力的影响和害怕困难的思想，巩固了队伍，促进了人的思想革命化。
                                （大庆“铁人”　王进喜）
    自力更生克服困难，给革命接班人树立了好榜样。现在的青年人，都是吃蜜糖长大的，他们没有经受过旧社会的苦，也没有遇到过什么大困难。我们自力更生克服困难，就使他们懂得了应该怎样对待困难。我们队里的青年人，经过一年的奋斗，已经认识到：困难并不可怕，只要有革命干劲，靠自己的双手能把幸福争回来。　（大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵）
    我们对兰考的一草一木都有深厚的感情。面对着当前严重的自然灾害，我们有革命的胆略，坚决领导全县人民，苦战三五年，改变兰考的面貌。不达目的，我们死不瞑目。
                          （前河南兰考县委书记　焦裕禄）
                  勤俭节约，艰苦朴素
    坐在破椅子上就不能革命吗？
    灾区面貌没有改变，还大量吃着国家的统销粮，群众生活很困难。富丽堂皇的事，不但不能做，就是连想也很危险。兰考是灾区，比不得丰收区。即使是丰收区，也是不应该做的。
                        （前河南兰考县委书记　焦裕禄）
    我们是干革命，为人民服务的，不是来升官发财的。生活上用劲大了，工作上就会用劲小，思想上开了享受的口子，就会越裂越大，走到邪路上去。
                  （解放军济南部队某部司务长　孙乐义）
    要敢挑重担，见困难就上；要吃苦在先，享乐在后；要把方便让给别人，困难留给自己。
        （山西临猗县城西公社好义大队饲养员　王传河）
          七、为革命而生，为革命而死
    编者按：毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”无产阶级革命者，相信自己的事业是正义的，不惜牺牲个人的一切，随时准备把自己的生命奉献给我们的事业。为革命而生，为革命而死，这就是共产主义道德的最高表现。这种为革命而不怕死的革命精神，就是无产阶级的革命气节和革命坚定性。雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、韦必江……等同志的英雄事迹，正是这种崇高的共产主义道德的表现。他们是我们学习的榜样。
                为共产主义理想不怕牺牲
    人民革命的胜利，是要千百万人的牺牲去换取的，为了胜利而承担这种牺牲，是我们共产党人最大的骄傲和愉快。
    即使有一天，这个世界上没有了我，我也仍然衷心地相信：共产主义的理想必然胜利！一定会有更多更多觉醒了的人为它战斗！
    如果需要为共产主义的理想而牺牲，我们每一个人，都应该、也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳。
    当我临终之时，我将无愧地对世人宣称，我的一生，都献给了壮丽的共产主义事业。
    一个人的生命和无产阶级永葆青春的革命事业联系在一起，那是无尚的光荣！　（共产主义战士　欧阳海）
    当你真正把为人民的利益，为共产主义事业而死，看成是理所当然和最大幸福的时候，你就会有百倍千倍的勇气，面对着死亡；你就会有无穷无尽的智慧，迎接着困难，世界上就没有任何力量，能阻挡你的前进！
      “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”。在战争年代，如果没有无数的象董存瑞那样的革命先烈，以高度的自我牺牲精神，忘我战斗，新中国的诞生是不可能的。……今天，社会主义革命和社会主义建设，也仍然需要我们在必要时，象向秀丽、欧阳海那样，勇敢地献出自己的生命；需要我们当个人利益与集体利益发生矛盾的时候，毫不犹豫地牺牲个人的利益；需要我们为了共产主义的建设事业，自觉地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。这一切，都是革命的自我牺牲精神的表现。这种革命的自我牺牲精神，就是全心全意为人民服务的精神，就是“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，就是彻底革命的精神，就是伟大的共产主义精神，它是永远值得我们学习和发扬的。
              （董存瑞亲密战友、特等战斗英雄　郅顺义）
    “为共产主义事业而生，为无产阶级利益而死”
    人总有一死，不能无谓地死，要为共产主义事业而生，为无产阶级利益而死。
    遇难挺身而出，遇利克己让人。
    怕什么，我们是为人民服务的，当人民需要的时候，我们就应该挺身而出，不能贪生怕死。
    消防队不仅要救火，群众被水淹了我们也要抢救。凡是群众受到灾难，我们就不能不管。　（消防战士　韦必江）
    为革命而牺牲是有意义的。在革命斗争中，有个人的死，才有人民大众的生，有少数人的死，才有多数人的生，有革命先烈的死，才有子孙万代的生。总而言之，没有部分人的死亡，就不能取得革命的胜利，就不可能使广大人民群众很好地活下去。一个革命战士，就应该象董存瑞那样，生为人民生，死为人民死。只有这样，才能真正作到毛主席所讲的那样：生的伟大，死的光荣。（董存瑞亲密战友、特等战斗英雄　郅顺义）
    我为人民而生，为人民而战，为人民献出问心无愧的一生。　（共产主义战士　欧阳海）
    在战争期间，要象黄继光、董存瑞那样，为了革命粉身碎骨而毫无犹豫，献身于炮火之中；要象罗盛教、白求恩那样，发扬大无畏的国际主义精神；在和平建设时期，就要象雷锋那样，全心全意地为人民服务。　（大庆五好标兵　张洪池）
