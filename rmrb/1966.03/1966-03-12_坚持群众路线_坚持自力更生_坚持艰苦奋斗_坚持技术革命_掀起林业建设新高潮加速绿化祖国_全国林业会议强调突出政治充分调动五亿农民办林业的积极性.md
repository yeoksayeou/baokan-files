    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, giving prominence to politics, relying on the spirit of Dazhai, relying on the Party's policies, and relying on the enthusiasm of 500 million peasants, launch a mass upsurge in forestry construction, accelerate the greening of the motherland to meet the needs of national economic development, national defense construction, and people's lives. This is the task of forestry work proposed at the recent National Forestry Work Conference held in Beijing.

    Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Bo Yibo and other Party and state leaders received all the representatives attending the meeting. Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin held a discussion with some representatives and spoke on some major issues in China's forestry construction. The representatives were greatly encouraged, and they expressed that they would redouble their efforts to complete the task of forestry construction.

    The meeting considered that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China's forestry construction has made great achievements in the past sixteen years. Many newly built forests across the country have begun to play a role in preventing wind and fixing sand, conserving water and soil, and ensuring agricultural production. Some have also begun to provide timber and forest by-products. At the same time, work in forest fire prevention, forest renewal, closing hillsides for afforestation, and tending secondary forests has played a significant role in protecting and expanding forest resources. With the development of forestry construction, not only has a forestry construction team been formed, but also a new situation of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in forestry has emerged in many regions.

    Based on summarizing the experience of forestry construction over the past sixteen years, the meeting proposed that China's forestry development should follow its own path. The meeting held that China's path of forestry development is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, adhere to the mass line, adhere to self-reliance, adhere to hard struggle, adhere to technological revolution, vigorously launch mass movements, and follow the path of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in forestry. In forestry work, it is necessary to give prominence to politics and use politics to drive forestry construction; it is necessary to adhere to the mass line, rely on the people's communes, and vigorously launch mass movements; it is necessary to focus on collective ownership by communes and production brigades, combining collective, state-owned, and state-collective joint ventures; it is necessary to base on afforestation, combining harvesting and cultivation; it is necessary to start from the current production and livelihood needs of the masses, combining short-term and long-term goals, using short-term benefits to support long-term development, and promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; it is necessary to combine leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers and peasants to carry out mass scientific experiments, technical innovations, and technical revolution. In this way, China's forestry construction can fully implement the requirements of the Party's general line for socialist construction, achieve excellence as the top priority, seeking more within excellence, seeking speed within excellence, and seeking economy within excellence.

    The meeting discussed and studied the future forestry construction guidelines and made arrangements for this year's work. The meeting required all localities to continue to give prominence to politics, conscientiously implement the principles of relying on the masses, self-reliance, vigorously afforestation, attaching equal importance to afforestation and management, combining forestry and grain, multiple operations, combining harvesting and cultivation, and comprehensive utilization, so as to better serve the needs of agricultural production increase, national defense construction, industrial production, and people's lives. The broad masses of forestry workers, especially leading cadres at all levels, must put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work, make great efforts in the word "application," and establish the thinking of thorough revolution, wholeheartedly serving the people, building forestry for the people, and relying on the people to build forestry. The meeting required all localities to start from the current urgent needs of the masses, deeply mobilize the masses, and carry out afforestation, cultivation, and forest protection movements on a larger scale; actively run commune and brigade forest farms; seize the time to create farmland protection forests and soil and water conservation forests to promote stable and high agricultural yields; actively create fuelwood forests and timber forests, accelerate the greening of "four sides" [of houses, villages, roads, and waterways], vigorously carry out hillside closure for afforestation, and strive to solve the problem of rural firewood and timber self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Universally promote the advanced experience of forest tree grafting and actively develop various woody grains and woody oilseeds. The meeting pointed out that it is also necessary to strengthen state-owned afforestation undertakings and accelerate the construction of national timber base areas.

    全国林业会议强调突出政治充分调动五亿农民办林业的积极性
    据新华社九日讯　高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，靠大寨精神，靠党的政策，靠五亿农民的积极性，掀起一个群众性的办林业的林业建设新高潮，加速绿化祖国，以适应国民经济发展、国防建设和人民生活的需要。这是最近在北京举行的全国林业工作会议提出的林业工作的任务。
    刘少奇、周恩来、李富春、李先念、谭震林、薄一波等党和国家领导人接见了出席会议的全体代表。谭震林副总理同部分代表进行了座谈，并就我国林业建设上的一些重大问题讲了话。代表们受到很大鼓舞，他们表示一定加倍努力，完成林业建设任务。
    会议认为，十六年来，我国林业建设在毛泽东思想的指导下，取得很大的成绩。全国有不少新造的树林开始发挥防风固沙、保持水土、保障农业生产的作用，有一些还开始提供木材和林副产品。同时，护林防火、森林更新、封山育林和抚育次生林等方面的工作，对保护和扩大森林资源起了很大作用。随着林业建设的发展，不仅形成了一支林业建设队伍，而且在许多地区出现了全党全民办林业的新形势。
    会议在总结十六年来林业建设经验的基础上，提出我国林业发展应当走自己的道路。会议认为，我国林业发展的道路，就是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持群众路线，坚持自力更生，坚持艰苦奋斗，坚持技术革命，大搞群众运动，全党全民办林业的道路。在林业工作中，必须突出政治，以政治带动林业建设；要坚持群众路线，依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动；要以社队集体为主，集体、国营、国社合营相结合；要以营林为基础，采育结合；要从群众当前生产生活需要出发，长短结合，以短养长，农林牧副互相促进全面发展；要实行领导干部、技术人员和工农群众相结合，开展群众性的科学实验、技术革新、技术革命。这样，我国的林业建设就能全面贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的要求，作到好字当头，好中求多，好中求快，好中求省。
    会议讨论和研究了今后的林业建设方针，部署了今年的工作。会议要求各地继续突出政治，认真贯彻依靠群众，自力更生，大力造林，造管并重，林粮结合，多种经营，采育结合，综合利用的方针，更好地为农业增产、国防建设、工业生产和人民生活需要服务。林业部门的广大职工，特别是各级领导干部，要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，在“用”字上狠下功夫，树立彻底革命，全心全意为人民服务，为人民建设林业，依靠人民建设林业的思想。会议要求各地从当前群众的迫切需要出发，深入发动群众，更大规模地开展造林、育林、护林运动；积极办好社队林场；抓紧营造农田防护林、水土保持林，促进农业稳产高产；积极营造薪炭林和用材林，加紧“四旁”绿化，大力开展封山育林，争取尽快解决农村烧柴和用材自给问题。普遍推广林木嫁接的先进经验，积极发展各种木本粮食、木本油料。会议指出还要加强国营造林事业，加速国家用材林基地的建设。
