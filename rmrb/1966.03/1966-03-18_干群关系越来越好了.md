    The Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses is Getting Better and Better
    Daqing Oilfield, Zhang Wentao
    One day off, Song Baotang, the captain of the drilling and pre-drilling engineering team, came to the surveying team and saw two apprentices playing chess, so he sat down beside them. Unexpectedly, the two apprentices looked at each other, and one of them said, "Let's go eat," and left without finishing the game.
    Song Baotang was a little puzzled, thinking: Before, when I came here, they were very enthusiastic to me, why are they different today?
    The next day, Song Baotang chatted with the leader of the surveying team. He told the leader to go back and talk to the two apprentices to see what problems they had in their minds.
    A few days later, the team leader told Song Baotang the ideological problems of the two apprentices in detail.
    The matter was like this: One day, Song Baotang led some comrades from the pre-drilling engineering team to work on the well site. Because there were not enough people, Song Baotang asked the two apprentices to help the repair team. Usually, the two of them always had their instruments with them, but this time the captain asked them to help the repair team, and it was inconvenient to carry the instruments, so they put the instruments on the snow. Who knew that after finishing the work, the instruments were frozen to the ground. It took a lot of effort to get them out. After Song Baotang found out, he criticized them again. The two felt a little wronged, so they developed a complaint against Song Baotang.
    After listening to this, Song Baotang came to the surveying team's dormitory that evening, found the two apprentices, and asked for their opinions. At first, the two said, "No opinions." Seeing that they were unwilling to speak, Song Baotang directly brought up the matter of letting them help with work on the well site. And he examined his own shortcomings such as simple working methods, not thinking thoroughly, and insufficient investigation and research. When the two apprentices saw that the captain had examined himself, they couldn't stay put either. Before the captain finished speaking, they also scrambled to examine themselves. They said: "We are not strong in responsibility, and almost scrapped the instruments. It is not right to have opinions on the leaders and not raise them, but to keep them in our hearts and sulk."
    Two apprentices, one captain, talked more and more intimately. Finally, the two apprentices also sincerely suggested to the captain methods to improve the work. Song Baotang also pointed out the direction of their efforts with great concern. And encouraged them to read Chairman Mao's books and work hard on the word "use". The two apprentices were more and more excited as they listened. Finally, holding Song Baotang's hand tightly, they said: "Don't worry, from now on we will definitely do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions!"
    From then on, not only was the gap between the two apprentices and the captain eliminated, but the unity of the team became better and better.

    干群关系越来越好了
    大庆油田　张文涛
    一个休息天，钻井钻前工程队队长宋保堂来到测量班，看到两个徒工正在下棋，也就坐在一旁。可是没想到，两个徒工互相看了看，其中一个人说了声：“吃饭去”，结果一盘棋没下完就走了。
    宋保堂有点纳闷，心想：以前我到这里来，他们对我很热情，今天为什么不同了呢？
    第二天，宋保堂找测量班的班长闲聊起来。他告诉班长回去和两个徒工谈谈心，看他们思想上到底有什么问题。
    过了几天，班长一五一十地把两个徒工的思想问题告诉了宋保堂。
    事情原来是这样：有一天，宋保堂带着钻前工程队的一部分同志在井上工作。由于人手不够，宋保堂就叫这两个徒工帮助维修班工作。两个人平日都是仪器不离身，这次队长叫他俩帮助维修班工作，背着仪器不方便，就把仪器放在雪地上。谁知干完工作后，仪器冻在地上了。费了九牛二虎之力才取了下来。宋保堂发现后，又批评了他们一顿。两个人觉得有点委屈，于是，对宋保堂便产生了埋怨情绪。
    宋保堂听后，就在这天傍晚，来到测量班宿舍，把两个徒工找到跟前，征求他们的意见。开始，两人说：“没啥意见。”宋保堂见他们不肯说，就直截了当地把井场上让他们帮助工作的事儿提起来了。并且检查了自己工作方法简单，想的不周全，调查研究不够等缺点。两个徒工见队长检查了自己，也都呆不住了。没等队长说完，也争着检查起自己来。他们说：“我们责任心不强，险些报废仪器。对领导有意见又不提，放在心里生闷气，太不应该了。”
    两个徒工，一个队长，越谈越亲切。最后，两个徒工还诚恳地给队长提出了工作中要改进的方法。宋保堂也很关切地给他俩指出了努力的方向。并鼓励他们读毛主席的书，在“用”字上狠下功夫。两个徒工越听越激动。最后，紧握着宋保堂的手说：“你放心，今后我们一定照毛主席的指示办事！”
    从那以后，不仅消除了两个徒工和队长之间的隔阂，而且队里的团结也越来越好了。
