    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Four newly built small fertilizer plants in Anhui have recently been officially put into production. Including those built before this, Anhui now has twelve small fertilizer plants. These fertilizer plants can produce 160,000 tons of fertilizer annually.
    These four newly built fertilizer plants are located in the high-yield rice area south of the Yangtze River, the Pi-Shi-Hang irrigation area of Jianghuai, and the Huaibei Plain, a low-yield grain area. They can produce nearly 30,000 tons of ammonia and ammonium bicarbonate annually. The design, building construction, equipment installation, and the training of technical personnel for these four fertilizer plants were all completed with the specific assistance of the old plants. Therefore, the construction speed was very fast. They were generally completed and put into production in just six or seven months, shortening the original plan by three or four months. The average investment for each plant was reduced by about 10% compared to the original plan. The quality of the project was also very good, achieving success on the first test run.

    安徽又建成四座小型化肥厂
    据新华社合肥电　安徽新建的四座小型化肥厂已在最近正式投入生产。连同在此之前建成的在内，目前安徽已拥有小型化肥厂十二座。这些化肥厂每年可以生产化肥十六万吨。
    新建的这四座化肥厂分布在长江南岸水稻高产区、江淮淠史杭灌区和粮食低产区淮北平原，每年可产氨水和碳酸氢铵近三万吨。这四座化肥厂的设计、厂房建筑和设备安装，以及技术力量的培养等，都是在老厂的具体帮助下完成的，因而建设速度都很快，一般只用了六七个月就迅速建成投入生产，比原计划缩短三四个月，平均每个厂的投资比原计划节省百分之十左右。工程质量也都很好，做到了一次试车成功。
