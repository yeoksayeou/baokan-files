    A Lost Hydrogen Bomb
    A little over two months ago, on January 17th, residents of the small town of Palomares on the southeastern coast of Spain saw a team of American B-52 bombers refueling in the air. Suddenly, one bomber collided with the tanker and crashed.
    For two planes to collide in the vast sky is as rare as two ships colliding in the boundless ocean, which wouldn't be unusual for the United States. But this time, Washington was tight-lipped about the crash, not saying a word for a whole month about what had happened.
    During this time, however, U.S. Air Force personnel quietly conducted an intense search in the Palomares area where the incident occurred.
    U.S. Newsweek wrote: "For six weeks, dozens of U.S. Air Force personnel, with primitive tools like bamboo poles or modern equipment like ray vibrators and measuring instruments, have been poking and 'listening' on a small, desolate piece of land on the southeastern coast of Spain, day after day. Each day, Navy frogmen from a team of ships anchored in the sea also meticulously searched the nearby shallow waters, while small submarines groped in the deeper waters further offshore. Throughout this time, helicopters and observation planes circled overhead, trucks raced back and forth, and bulldozers scraped at the earth."
    It was only recently, after the Spanish authorities leaked information, that Washington issued a statement confirming that the incident involved nuclear radiation and a missing hydrogen bomb.
    The U.S. State Department's statement admitted that the crashed bomber was carrying four megaton-class hydrogen bombs. After the incident, three were found among the scattered wreckage and debris, two of which had burst their casings upon impact with the ground. Although a thermonuclear reaction had not occurred, they had emitted the radioactive material contained within, dangerously contaminating the surrounding area.
    However, the Americans were so busy there not out of concern for the lives of the Spanish villagers, but for fear of the secrets of the lost hydrogen bomb being revealed and causing adverse political reactions, especially inciting a wave of protests against U.S. military bases by the people of various countries.
    The U.S. government, in order to prepare for wars of aggression and maintain a tense situation, often sends aircraft carrying nuclear bombs to patrol the skies, and this is not the first time that such a plane carrying nuclear bombs has had an accident.
    Each accident has aroused the hatred and opposition of the people of all countries towards U.S. imperialism's preparation for nuclear war. This time, the United States will not be able to quell the anger of the Spanish people. After the incident, local residents held protest demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Americans and their bombs," "Americans, take your bombs and get out!" Citizens of Madrid also held anti-American demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy. (Píng Mò) (Attached picture)

    一颗失落的氢弹
    两个多月以前，一月十七日，西班牙东南沿海小镇帕洛马雷斯居民看到一队美国B—52型轰炸机在空中加油。突然间，一架轰炸机同加油飞机相撞同时坠毁。
    在偌大的天空中两架飞机竟然相撞，正如在无边的海洋里两艘轮船相撞一样，在美国说来本来不算稀奇。可是这一次，华盛顿对于撞机事件却讳莫如深，整整一个多月，绝口不谈是怎么回事。
    但是这期间，美国空军人员却在出事地区帕洛马雷斯悄悄地进行了紧张的搜索活动。
    美国《新闻周刊》这样写道：“六星期以来，几十个美国空军人员，带着象竹竿这种原始的工具或是象射线震动仪和测量仪这类现代化装备，在西班牙东南沿海一小片荒凉的土地上，一天又一天地在地上戳着、‘听’着。每一天，从停在海里的一队船舰上下来的海军蛙人，也在附近的浅海里周到地搜寻，同时，小型的潜水艇则在离岸较远的深水里摸索。整个时间里，直升飞机和观测飞机在天上盘旋，卡车来回奔驰，推土机挖削着泥土。”
    直到最近，因为西班牙官方有了透露，华盛顿方面才发表声明证实，原来事件中牵涉到核辐射和一颗丢失了的氢弹。
    美国国务院的声明承认，那架撞毁的轰炸机携带有四颗百万吨级的氢弹。事件发生后，在散落到当地的飞机残骸、碎片中间找到了三个，其中两个已因落地时撞击而外壳爆裂。虽然尚未引起热核反应，却已散发出装在其中的放射物质，使周围受到危险的污染。
    不过，美国人在那里这样忙碌，并非出于对西班牙村民生命的关怀，而是怕失落了氢弹的秘密和引起不良的政治反应，特别是激起各国人民反对美国军事基地的抗议浪潮。
    美国政府为了准备侵略战争，保持紧张局势，经常派出携带核弹的飞机在天空巡逻，而这种带核弹飞机的出事，已经不是第一次了。
    每一次的出事，都引起了各国人民对美帝国主义准备核战争的仇视和反对。这次美国要想平息西班牙人民的愤怒，也是办不到的。在事件发生后，当地的居民就举行了抗议示威，高呼“打倒美国佬和他们的炸弹”，“美国佬连着你们的炸弹一起滚蛋！”的口号。马德里市民还在美国大使馆前举行了反美示威。　（苹末）（附图片）
