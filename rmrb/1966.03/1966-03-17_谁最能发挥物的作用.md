    Who can best unleash the potential of things? People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can best unleash the potential of things.

    The Guangzhou Knitting Factory obtained ten imported warp knitting machines, and regarded them as invaluable treasures. They busied themselves with supporting facilities and building workshops, which can be said to be valuing the material factors! But, did they unleash the potential of these things? No. The warp knitting machines sat idle for more than four years, and not only were they not put into production, but even trial production was unsuccessful. In the end, the "treasures" became "burdens."

    Who made these ten warp knitting machines play their role? It was people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, people who acted under the guiding ideology of "the human factor first." They dismantled the machines to understand their workings, and used indigenous methods to tackle key problems, finally bringing these ten warp knitting machines back to life, putting them into production, and unleashing their potential.

    Placing the human factor first is the only way to unleash the potential of things; placing the material factor first, on the contrary, prevents the potential of things from being unleashed. Isn't this a clear example?

    Why is it that placing the human factor first is the only way to unleash the potential of things, while placing the material factor first, on the contrary, prevents the potential of things from being unleashed? The reason is very simple: people are alive, things are dead; people are the masters of things, and the role of things cannot be separated from the role of people for even a moment. Machines need people to manufacture them, and need people to operate them; the reform of machines also needs people to use their brains and think of methods. Without people, there would be no machines; the more the role of people is brought into play, the more the role of machines is brought into play. Some people look at the relationship between people and things from a metaphysical point of view, separating the human factor from the material factor, and talking about the role of things apart from the role of people. If they are constantly going from thing to thing, revolving around things, and not first unleashing the role of people, how can the role of things be fully unleashed? And how can they not move towards their own opposite, valuing things but wasting them, and going from regarding things as "treasures" to regarding them as "burdens"!

    The material factor first is a reflection of bourgeois ideology. In the eyes of the bourgeoisie, workers are merely parts of machines, slaves of machines. The interests of the bourgeoisie are in sharp opposition to the interests of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie cannot expect the proletariat to bring their initiative into play for them. Therefore, the bourgeoisie can only rely on machines, using machines to extract more labor from the workers. However, no matter how efficient the machines in the hands of the bourgeoisie are, their irreconcilable contradiction with the proletariat determines that the efficiency of the machines is always limited and cannot be fully unleashed.

    In our country, workers are the masters of the country, and also the masters of machines. The interests of the country are completely consistent with the class interests and personal interests of the working class. The working class has immeasurable revolutionary enthusiasm for the sake of the interests of the country and their own interests. Therefore, in our country, the human factor is the first factor. As long as the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people is fully mobilized, the role of things can be more fully unleashed. The same machine has one efficiency in capitalist countries, but can achieve a higher efficiency in our country. The reason for this lies in the positive human factors that we have; we are able to mobilize the positive human factors.

    The human factor first. Only by fully unleashing the role of people can the role of things be fully unleashed. This is a Marxist truth. Let us study Chairman Mao Zedong's writings, talk a lot about highlighting politics, fully mobilize the positive factors of people, study the performance of things, grasp the laws of things, and make the role of things be most fully unleashed in our hands.

### 谁最能发挥物的作用

    谁最能发挥物的作用
    谁最能发挥物的作用？用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最能发挥物的作用。
    广州针织厂得到十台进口的经编机，如获至宝，忙着搞配套，建厂房，可以说是看重物的因素了！可是，他们发挥了物的作用没有呢？没有。经编机摆了四年多，不但没有投入生产，连试产也没有成功。最后，“宝贝”成了“包袱”。
    是谁使这十台经编机发挥了作用呢？是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是在“人的因素第一”的指导思想下行动起来的人。他们拆机器摸究竟，用土法攻关键，终于使这十台经编机起死回生，投入生产，发挥了作用。
    把人的因素摆在第一位，才能发挥物的作用，把物的因素摆在第一位，反而不能发挥物的作用。这不是一个鲜明的例子吗？
    为什么把人的因素摆在第一位，才能发挥物的作用；把物的因素摆在第一位，反而不能发挥物的作用呢？道理很简单：人是活的，物是死的，人是物的主人，物的作用一时一刻也离不开人的作用。机器要人来制造，要人来操作；机器的改革，也要人来动脑筋，想办法。没有人，便没有机器；人的作用发挥得越大，机器的作用也发挥得越大。有些人用形而上学的观点看待人和物的关系，把人的因素同物的因素割裂开来，撇开了人的作用去讲物的作用，整天从物到物，在物的圈子里转来转去，不首先发挥人的作用，怎么能使物的作用得到充分发挥呢？又怎么能不走向自己的反面，看重物反而糟踏了物，从把物当“宝贝”到把物当“包袱”呢！
    物的因素第一，这是资产阶级思想的反映。在资产阶级心目中，工人只是机器的零件，是机器的奴隶。资产阶级的利益同无产阶级的利益是尖锐对立的，资产阶级不可能指望无产阶级为他们发挥积极性。因此，资产阶级只能指望机器，用机器榨取工人更多的劳动。但是，不管资产阶级手里的机器有多么高的效率，他同无产阶级不可调和的矛盾，决定了机器的效率总是有限的、不可能充分发挥的。
    在我们国家，工人是国家的主人，也是机器的主人。国家的利益同工人阶级的阶级利益和个人利益是完全一致的。工人阶级为着国家的利益和自己的利益，有着不可估量的革命积极性。因此，在我们国家里，人的因素是第一位的，只要把人民群众的革命积极性充分调动起来，就能使物的作用得到更充分的发挥。同样一台机器，在资本主义国家是一个效率，到了我们国家就能发挥更高的效率，其原因就在于我们有人的积极因素，我们能够调动人的积极因素。
    人的因素第一。只有充分发挥人的作用，才能充分发挥物的作用。这是一条马克思主义的真理。让我们大学毛泽东同志的著作，大讲突出政治，把人的积极因素充分调动起来，研究物的性能，掌握物的规律，使物的作用在我们手中得到最充分的发挥。
