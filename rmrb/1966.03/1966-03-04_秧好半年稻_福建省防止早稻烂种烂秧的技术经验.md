    “Good Seedlings are Half the Harvest,” this is a production experience summarized by farmers in Fujian Province over a long period. In the past, we also conducted some experiments and research and promoted some technical measures, but none of them solved the problem well. Last year, by summarizing the typical experiences of more than a dozen brigades, such as Xianjie in Changle, Liming in Longhai, and Qiaojie in Minhou, which have not had seedling rot for many years, we further understood the laws of seed germination and the causes of seedling rot, and found ways to prevent seed and seedling rot.

    Understanding the Laws of Early Rice Germination

    Whether early rice germinates normally is greatly affected by the supply of temperature, moisture, and oxygen. What are the laws of early rice germination? 1. The minimum temperature for early rice seed germination is 10 to 12 degrees Celsius, the most suitable is 30 to 35 degrees, and the maximum is 40 degrees. Early spring in our province often has low temperature and rain. Therefore, early rice seeds must go through the germination stage before sowing, and measures such as heating, watering, and turning are taken to adjust the temperature and moisture, and keep the temperature as much as possible at 30 to 35 degrees, so that the germination is neat, rapid, and uniform. If the temperature is too high, exceeding 40 degrees, "bud burn" will occur. 2. When the oxygen supply is sufficient, the roots and leaves grow normally; if the oxygen supply is insufficient, the leaves and young roots grow weakly. 3. In moist conditions, the roots of the seeds are long and the buds are short, making it easy to take root; in flooded conditions, the buds are long and the roots are short, the top is heavy and the bottom is light, making it difficult to take root and easily causing bud rot. 4. Before the true leaves emerge from the leaf sheath, early rice seeds have strong cold resistance. After the true leaves emerge from the leaf sheath, the cold resistance decreases. In the past, the old method of cultivating water seedlings was used, so seed and seedling rot often occurred. The main reason was that the laws of early rice germination were not mastered, and the technology was not properly controlled.

    How to Prevent Seedling Rot

    The experiences and methods of Xianjie, Liming, and other brigades in preventing seedling rot are as follows:

    1. Do a good job in germination: On the basis of sunning the seeds, selecting seeds with salt (mud) water, disinfecting the seeds, and soaking the seeds, use the method of "high-temperature breaking germination, suitable-temperature germination" according to the characteristics of seed germination. Before germination, use 37 to 38 degrees Celsius warm water to water the seeds or soak them in warm water for 2 to 3 minutes, then put the seeds into a bamboo basket and place them in a room for heat preservation and germination. Pad the bottom of the basket with rice straw, cover the top of the basket tightly with rice straw or sacks, and surround the stacked baskets tightly with rice straw to increase insulation. After stacking, water with warm water once every morning and evening. When about 90% of the seeds have broken germination and exposed white, turn and loosen the seeds and water with warm water. Afterwards, maintain the temperature at 30 to 35 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too low, the growth of roots and buds will be poor; if the temperature is too high, there is a danger of "bud burn." When the buds are half the size of a grain of rice and the roots are the size of a grain of rice, they can be taken out for sowing. At this time, if the weather is cold and rainy, spread the seeds out to dry and control germination. Wait until the cold wave passes before seizing the sunny weather for sowing.

    In the past one or two years, some brigades in Longhai, Jinjiang, and other counties have changed the old-fashioned germination method and adopted greenhouse steam germination, which has achieved significant results in preventing seedling rot. Using greenhouse steam germination, the seeds can break germination and expose white on the day of "entering the nest" (i.e., putting them in the basket), and the roots and buds can grow to the extent required for sowing on the second day. Sowing can be done on the third day, shortening the time by 3 to 4 days compared with the general germination method. In this way, in the case of frequent changes in cold and warm weather in early spring, people can grasp the "end of cold and beginning of warmth" to sow in a timely manner and avoid damage from cold waves based on weather forecasts.

    2. Finely prepare the seedling fields, apply mud to the seeds, moisten to take root, and shallowly cultivate seedlings: The seedling fields must be shallowly ploughed, no more than three inches. Land preparation should be done as early, thoroughly, evenly, and cleanly as possible. The seedling bed must be leveled, so that the young seedlings in a field can get a reasonable water layer, without being dry at higher places and submerged at lower places, so that growth is normal. It is best to use moist seedling fields with ditches and ridges. After preparing the seedling bed of the moist seedling field, flatten it with a wooden board and then sow. The more level the seedling bed, the higher the seedling emergence rate. After the seedling bed is prepared, sticky soil should be sown after the soil is settled, so that half of the seeds fall into the mud and half are exposed outside the soil, so that the roots are firm and quick, and the oxygen is sufficient. Sandy soil should be sown in muddy water to achieve the same purpose.

    From sowing to rooting, manage the water according to the characteristics of rice seeds, which "grow buds in water layer and roots in moisture". There is no need to irrigate after sowing. Keep water in the ditch and the seedling bed moist, so that the seedlings have sufficient air and appropriate moisture to promote rapid rooting, good root growth, and strong seedlings. At this time, because the true leaves have not yet emerged, they are more cold-resistant, and there is no need to take deep water to keep warm, so as to avoid insufficient oxygen in deep water, which will not grow roots and only grow sheaths. If attacked by low temperatures or cotton rot fungus, seedling rot will occur.

    After rooting, as the true leaves emerge one after another, the cold resistance of the seedling body gradually weakens. If the seedling bed continues to be kept moist at this time, the seedlings will be frozen to death if attacked by a cold wave; if the weather is sunny, the seedlings will have scorched leaves. Therefore, after the true leaves come out, shallow irrigation should be used to protect the seedlings and keep them warm. As the seedlings grow, the water layer gradually deepens to about one inch, which can prevent seedling rot and promote the growth of strong seedlings.

    3. Sow early at the appropriate time and prevent blind premature sowing: Practice has proved that the early rice sowing period should be controlled at an average daily temperature of 10 to 12 degrees Celsius or more for safety. Rice seeds need three consecutive days of sunny weather after sowing to quickly take root and emerge. Therefore, within the appropriate early sowing range, it is also necessary to grasp the "end of cold and beginning of warmth" and seize the sunny weather for sowing according to the laws of early spring climate change.

    4. Apply decomposed organic fertilizer: It is emphasized that basal fertilizer for seedling fields should be decomposed organic fertilizer. If green manure is applied, it should be ploughed into the soil 15 to 20 days before sowing. Farm manure, human manure, and urine should be applied after being decomposed to avoid harmful substances being generated during the fermentation process, causing seedling rot.

    Pay Attention to Cultivating Strong Seedlings

    Practice has proved that strong seedlings re-green faster, tiller earlier, tiller faster, and have a higher panicle rate than "hair seedlings", which can increase production by 10% to 20%. To cultivate strong seedlings, first of all, sow thinly and spread evenly. If sowing is dense, even if more fertilizer is applied, the purpose of cultivating strong seedlings cannot be achieved. Thin sowing means that each seedling occupies a large space, can fully absorb nutrients and make full use of sunlight, and the seedlings develop well and grow strongly. Thin sowing should also be combined with early sowing, so that strong seedlings with five to six leaves can be cultivated.

    Secondly, apply sufficient basal fertilizer and topdressing at the appropriate time. Early rice seedling cultivation is in the low-temperature season. To cultivate strong seedlings, basal fertilizer, seedling-needle fertilizer (generally applied when one leaf is encased), weaning fertilizer, and a transplanting fertilizer must be applied. In areas where there is a habit of cultivating long-aged seedlings, a seedling-strengthening fertilizer can be applied between the weaning fertilizer and the transplanting fertilizer. As for the amount of fertilizer applied each time, it should be determined according to the soil fertility and the growth of the seedlings.

    Thirdly, moist seedling fields should be used for seedling cultivation. According to the experimental data of Fujian Agricultural College, the embryo conversion rate (the ratio of dry matter converted from each gram of embryo dry matter to dry matter of roots and leaves) of seedlings cultivated in moist seedling beds is 2.6 times that of water seedlings, so the seedlings are strong.

    “秧好半年稻”
    福建省防止早稻烂种烂秧的技术经验
      “秧好半年稻”，这是福建省农民在长期生产实践中总结出来的一条增产经验。过去我们也曾经搞过一些试验研究，推广过一些技术措施，但都没有把问题解决好。去年我们通过总结长乐仙街、龙海黎明、闽侯桥街等十几个大队多年不烂秧的典型经验，进一步认识了种子萌发的规律和烂秧的原因，找到了防止烂种、烂秧的办法。
    认识早稻萌发的规律
    早稻发芽正常与否，受温度、水分和氧气的供应条件影响很大。早稻发芽的规律是什么呢？1，早稻种子发芽的最低温度是摄氏十至十二度，最适宜为三十至三十五度，最高为四十度。我省早春经常低温阴雨，因此，早稻种子在播种前，要经过催芽阶段，采取加热、淋汤、翻动等措施，调节好温度和水分，把温度尽可能保持在三十至三十五度，使出芽整齐、迅速和均匀。温度太高了，如果超过四十度，就会发生“烧芽”。2，氧气供给充足，根叶生长正常，如果氧气供给不足，本叶和幼根生长微弱。3，种子在湿润情况下，根长芽短，容易扎根；在淹水情况下，芽长根短，上重下轻，不易扎根，容易烂芽。4，早稻种子在真叶抽出鞘叶前，抗寒力较强，真叶从鞘叶抽出后，抗寒力减弱。过去用老办法育水秧的，所以常常发生烂种、烂秧，主要原因是没有掌握早稻发芽规律，技术掌握不当。
    怎样才能不烂秧
    仙街、黎明等大队不烂秧的经验和方法有以下几点：
    1、认真做好催芽工作：在晒种、盐（泥）水选种、种子消毒和浸种的基础上，根据种子萌发的特点，采用“高温破胸，适温催芽”的方法进行催芽。出芽前，用三十七至三十八度的温水淋种或在温水中浸二至三分钟，然后把种子装入箩筐内，放在室内保温催芽。箩底垫稻草，箩顶用稻草或麻袋盖密，并在箩筐堆迭的周围，用稻草围紧围密，这样可以增加保温能力。堆后要每天早晚各淋温水一次，等到种子破胸露白达百分之九十左右时，要把种子翻动抖松，并淋温水，以后保持三十至三十五度，温度降低，根芽生长不良，温度过高，就有“烧芽”危险，等芽长半粒谷、根长一粒谷时，就可以取出播种。这时，如果天气低温阴雨，就把种子摊开晾种，控制发芽，等寒潮过后，抢晴播种。
    最近一、二年，龙海、晋江等县部分大队改变过去旧式催芽，采用温室蒸气催芽，取得不烂秧显著效果。采用温室蒸气催芽的，“入巢”（即装箩）当天就可以破胸露白，第二天根芽生长就可以达到播种要求程度，第三天就可以播种，比一般方法催芽缩短时间三至四天以上。这样，在早春天气冷暖变化频繁的情况下，根据天气预报，人们就能够掌握“冷尾暖头”适时下种，避过寒潮为害。
      2、精做秧田，泥浆落谷，湿润扎根，浅水育秧：秧田必须浅耕，不超三寸。整地要尽可能做到早、烂、平、净。秧板一定要整平，这样一丘田的幼秧都能得到合理的水层，不至高的旱，低的淹，使生长正常。秧田最好采用有沟有畦的湿润秧田。在整好湿润秧田的秧板后，要用木板拉平，然后播种。秧板愈平，成苗率愈高。秧板整好后，粘土要等土泥沉实后播种，使种子撒下以后，有半粒落入泥浆里，半粒露在土外，使扎根牢，扎根快，氧气充足。沙土要浑水播种，才能达到同样的目的。
    播种后到扎根前，要根据水稻种子“水层长芽，湿润长根”的特点进行管水。播种后不必灌水，保持沟中有水，秧板湿润，使秧苗有充分空气和适当水分，促进扎根迅速，根部生长良好，秧苗粗壮。这时，因为真叶尚未吐出，比较耐寒，不必采取深水保温，以免深水氧气不足，不长根，光长芽鞘，遇到低温袭击或生绵腐菌，就发生烂秧。
    扎根以后，随着真叶相继出生，这时秧体抗寒力逐渐削弱，如果此时继续保持秧板湿润，遇到寒潮袭击，秧苗就会受冻而死；遇到天气晴朗，秧苗就会叶片焦枯。所以在真叶出来后，要采用浅水灌溉，护苗保温。随着秧苗的生长，水层逐渐加深到一寸左右，这样，既可防止烂秧，又能促使秧苗茁壮。
    3、适期早播、防止盲目提早：实践证明，早稻播种期应该掌握在日平均气温稳定在十至十二度以上比较安全。水稻播种后需要连续三天以上的晴天，才能很快地扎根出苗。因此，在适期早播范围内还要根据早春气候变化规律，掌握“冷尾暖头”抢晴播种。
    4、施用腐熟有机质肥料：秧田基肥要强调施用腐熟的有机质肥料。如果施用绿肥，要在播种前十五至二十天耕翻入土。厩肥、人粪尿等都要经过腐熟以后施入，以免有机肥料在发酵过程中，发生有害物质，造成烂秧。
    重视培育壮秧
    实践证明，壮秧比“牛毛秧”返青快、分蘖早、分蘖快、成穗率高，可增产一至二成。培育壮秧，首先要稀播、匀撒。如果密播，就是增施肥料，也不能达到育壮秧的目的。稀播种，每株秧苗所占空间大，可以充分吸收养料和充分利用阳光，秧苗发育良好，生长强健。稀播还要结合早播，这样才能培育出五至六叶包心的壮秧。
    其次，施足基肥，适期追肥。早稻育秧处在低温季节，培育壮秧必须施足基肥、秧针肥（一般在一叶包心时施下）、断乳肥和一次送嫁肥。有习惯培育长秧龄秧苗的地区，可在断乳肥和送嫁肥之间，加施一次壮苗肥。至于每次施肥用量，则要根据土壤肥力和秧苗生长情况来决定。
    第三、育苗要采用湿润秧田。根据福建农学院的试验材料，采用湿润育秧的秧苗，胚乳转化率（每克胚乳干物质转化为根叶干物质的比率）为水秧的二点六倍，所以秧苗粗壮。
