    Hanoi, March 4 (Xinhua) The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 4th, firmly refuting a series of slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently made by the Vientiane authorities of Laos.
    The statement said that recently, the Vientiane authorities issued many communiques fabricating the activities of the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Laos. On February 25, in a communique of a so-called "resolution of the National Assembly of Laos" issued by the Lao Prime Minister's Office, it slandered that the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "violated the neutrality of Laos."
    The statement said, "This is entirely a deceptive argument by the United States and the pro-American clique in Laos, attempting to use it to cover up the conspiracies of interference and aggression by the American imperialists against the Kingdom of Laos."
    The statement said that for a long time, the American imperialists have systematically undermined the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, and blatantly violated the sovereignty and neutrality of Laos. They have used American planes to continuously bomb and strafe many places in Laos, especially in central and lower Laos. They have also instigated right-wing troops to attack and nibble at many places controlled by the Lao Patriotic Front and other patriotic forces in Laos. At present, the American imperialists are plotting to send American troops to Laos, expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina, and attempt to save themselves from the predicament in which they are deeply mired in South Vietnam.
    The statement said that the so-called "resolution of the National Assembly" initiated by the pro-American clique in Laos is not the true voice of the Lao people, and is therefore completely worthless, and cannot undermine the friendship between the Vietnamese and Lao people. The Lao people clearly know that the American imperialist aggressors are their irreconcilable enemies, while the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always strictly fulfilled the 1962

    越南外交部发言人发表声明
    坚决驳斥万象当局对越南的诬蔑
    新华社河内四日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人四日发表声明，坚决驳斥老挝万象当局最近对越南民主共和国进行的一系列诬蔑。
    声明说，最近，万象当局发表许多捏造越南民主共和国军队在老挝活动的公报。二月二十五日，在老挝首相府发表的一项所谓“老挝国民议会决议”的公报中，又诬蔑越南民主共和国军队“侵犯老挝的中立”。
    声明说，“这完全是美国和老挝亲美集团的欺骗论调，妄图用它来掩盖美帝国主义者对老挝王国的干涉和侵略阴谋。”
    声明说，长期以来，美帝国主义者曾经系统地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，明目张胆地侵犯老挝的主权和中立。他们使用美国飞机接连轰炸和扫射老挝的许多地方，特别是中寮和下寮地区。他们还唆使右派军队进攻和蚕食老挝爱国战线党和老挝其他爱国力量控制的许多地方。目前，美帝国主义者正在阴谋把美国军队派往老挝，把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那，妄图挽救他们在越南南方深陷泥沼的困境。
    声明说，由老挝亲美集团倡议的所谓“国民议会决议”并不是老挝人民的真正声音，因此完全没有价值，是破坏不了越南人民同老挝人民之间的友谊的。老挝人民清楚地知道，美帝国主义侵略者是他们不共戴天的敌人，而越南民主共和国则一贯严正履行一九六二年日内瓦协议，彻底尊重老挝的主权和中立，一贯希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上同老挝王国保持良好的睦邻关系。
    声明最后要求美国和万象当局必须立即停止对越南民主共和国的诬蔑宣传，严格履行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
