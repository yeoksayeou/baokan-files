    She Walks on the Golden Road
    Red Star Commune Member Xiang Anhua
    A car heading from the Red Star Commune to Beijing carried a young woman. She is Comrade Liu Qingfeng, who is attending the Beijing Municipal Experience Exchange Meeting for Studying Chairman Mao's Works.
    Speaking of Liu Qingfeng's story, it's a long one! Originally from Yutian County, Hebei, in early 1960, she dropped out of junior high school and found a boyfriend who was a truck driver,一心想in hopes of finding a job in the city. Unexpectedly, her husband's hometown was also in the countryside. Not long after their marriage, he repeatedly urged her to return to the village. Helpless, she had to return to Suncun Brigade in Daxing County. From then on, the once talkative and cheerful girl became silent. After having children, she stopped going to the fields altogether.
    Her father learned of this situation and wrote to her, asking her to return to her parents' home. The whole family held a family meeting and recalled the revolutionary family history. Her father said earnestly, "Child, you must not forget your roots! You grew up under the red flag, why don't you listen to Chairman Mao's words? You have let down the Party's years of cultivation and education of you!..." Listening, listening, Qingfeng's eyes were filled with tears. She expressed to her father that she would inherit the cause of the revolutionary predecessors and be a red successor.
    After returning home, her child became ill. Qingfeng took the child by bus to the city for treatment. On the bus, the child suddenly had convulsions, and Qingfeng became anxious. Seeing her like this, the conductor comforted her and told the passengers to hurry up and get on and off the bus. When the final stop arrived, all the passengers got off. Qingfeng was also preparing to transfer, but the conductor stopped her: "Comrade, we'll take you to the hospital." "Take me?" Qingfeng asked in surprise. "Yes, a special car will take you." With this answer, the bus sped off like an arrow. Arriving at the Children's Hospital, Qingfeng excitedly grabbed the conductor's hand and said repeatedly, "Thank you, thank you." The conductor and driver said, "This is Chairman Mao's teaching, it is our duty to serve the people." These short words were deeply imprinted in her heart.
    As luck would have it, on the day the child was discharged from the hospital, they encountered a rainstorm on the way home. The wind was strong and the rain was heavy, and the roads were muddy. What to do? At this moment, two People's Liberation Army soldiers ran over from the wind and rain. One took off his raincoat and put it on her, and the other held the child, helping her find a place to shelter from the rain. After the rain, Qingfeng thanked them and asked for their names. They only answered three words: "People's Liberation Army," and strode away in their wet clothes. Qingfeng gratefully watched their receding figures. She said in her heart, this is the soldier taught by Chairman Mao!
    Her father's teachings, the warmth of revolutionary comrades, all intertwined in her heart, churning in her heart...
    She thought, her father is an old revolutionary, an old Party member, and often reads Chairman Mao's works until late at night; unfamiliar bus conductors and People's Liberation Army soldiers are so enthusiastic in helping me, also because they listen to Chairman Mao's words; what about me, I'm only twenty-one years old, and still an educated youth, why don't I study Chairman Mao's books properly?
    She opened Chairman Mao's works, and studied the article "Serve the People" more than thirty times in a row for seven days. She read and thought, thought and read, and a bright window opened in her heart. She understood how people should live. She thought of her own love of ease and aversion to labor, and not participating in labor, and couldn't help shedding tears of shame. She said to herself secretly: Yes, I want to go out of the house, be with the commune members, and participate in production labor.
    From then on, she worked in the fields during the day and studied Chairman Mao's works at night. She read one article after another. When she saw Chairman Mao's words that revolutionary work depends on everyone, and that helping one comrade progress is adding a revolutionary force, she thought that there are many women in the village who stop working in the fields once they have children, and she should mobilize them to participate in labor. She first chose to mobilize her sister-in-law, who lived separately.
    She said to her sister-in-law with great enthusiasm: "Sister-in-law, come out and work. Working is good for the country and for individuals!" Her sister-in-law only said, "I have too many children, I can't go!" and ignored her. Although she was rebuffed, she was not discouraged at all, thinking that I want to learn the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," if it doesn't work once, try twice, if it doesn't work twice, try three times, sooner or later I will persuade you. So she "stuck" to her sister-in-law. She mobilized her whenever she had the chance, but unexpectedly, this made her sister-in-law angry. Qingfeng thought: This person is too hopeless, I can't help her. After that, she ignored her sister-in-law.
    The Party branch discovered her mood and talked to her in time, and asked her to read the article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses and Pay Attention to Methods of Work" again.
    She opened Chairman Mao's works, and as she read, her eyes suddenly stopped on the sentence "All the actual problems in the lives of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to." Qingfeng thought: That's right, I just didn't care about my sister-in-law's life. She has five children and a lot of housework, but I only knew how to tell her grand principles. No wonder the branch secretary said that I didn't do my job well!
    From then on, she helped her sister-in-law wash her children's dirty clothes, and when she returned home, she chopped firewood for her sister-in-law. While her sister-in-law was cooking, she gave her firewood and told her about Chairman Mao's works, and her insights from her studies. Their conversations added new content, and their relationship became closer. With her help, her sister-in-law arranged her housework and participated in labor.
    After that, she cooperated with the branch to mobilize women to come out to participate in labor from house to house. Now, the women there have truly become half the sky.

    她走在金色的大道上
    红星公社社员　向安华
    一辆从红星公社开往北京的汽车上，坐着一个年轻的妇女。她就是出席北京市毛主席著作学习经验交流会的刘庆凤同志。
    说起刘庆凤的事来，话还长着呢！她原是河北玉田县人，一九六○年初中没毕业就找了个当汽车司机的对象，一心想在城里找个工作。没想到，她爱人的老家也在农村，结婚不久，就三番两次地动员她回乡，她无可奈何只得回到大兴县孙村大队。从此爱说爱笑的姑娘变得沉默寡言。有了孩子后就根本不再下地了。
    她父亲知道了这种情况，就来信让她回娘家，全家开了家庭会，回忆了革命的家史。她父亲语重心长地说：“孩子，不能忘本啊！你在红旗下长大，为什么不听毛主席的话？你对不起党对你这些年的培养教育啊！……”听着，听着，庆凤眼里满噙着泪水，她向父亲表示，要继承革命前辈的事业，做红色接班人。
    回家以后，孩子得了病。庆凤抱着孩子搭车到城里去看病，在车上孩子突然抽起风来，庆凤急得坐立不安。售票员见她这样，一面安慰她，一面告诉乘客，要求大家抓紧时间，紧下快上。终点站到了，乘客都下了车。庆凤也要准备转车，售票员拦住了她：“同志，我们送你到医院。”“送我？”庆凤惊讶地问。“是的，专车送你。”随着这回答，公共汽车象一支离弦的箭疾驶起来。到了儿童医院，庆凤激动地拉着售票员的手连声说：“谢谢你们，谢谢你们。”售票员和司机却说：“这是毛主席的教导，为人民服务是应该的。”这简短的两句话，深深地印在她的心里。
    事也凑巧，孩子出院的那天，回家路上又遇上了一场暴风雨。风大雨狂，道路泥泞。怎么办？这时，从风雨中跑过来两名解放军。一个脱下雨衣给她穿上，另一个抱着孩子，帮她找到了避雨的地方。雨后，庆凤向他们道谢，问他们的名字。他们只回答了三个字“解放军”，穿着湿淋淋的衣服大踏步地走了。庆凤感激地望着那远去的背影。心中说这就是毛主席教导出来的战士啊！
    父亲的教导，革命同志间的温暖，一起交织在她的心里，在她的心中翻腾着……
    她想，父亲是老革命、老党员，还经常读毛主席著作直到深夜；素不相识的汽车售票员，解放军，这么热心地帮助我，也是因为听了毛主席的话；我呢，才二十一岁，还是个知识青年，为什么就不好好读读毛主席的书呢？
    她翻开了毛主席著作，一连七天，《为人民服务》这篇文章，就学习了三十多遍。她读啊，想啊，想啊，读啊，心里打开了一扇透亮的窗户，她懂得了人应该怎样活着。她想起自己好逸恶劳，不参加劳动，不由得流下了羞愧的眼泪。她暗暗地说：对，我要走出家门，和社员在一起，参加生产劳动。
    从此，她白天下地干活，晚上学习毛主席著作。她读了一篇又一篇，当她看到毛主席说的革命的工作要靠大家来做，能帮助一个同志进步就是增加一份革命力量时，她想到村里有好些妇女一有了孩子就不下地干活了，应该去动员她们参加劳动。她首先选定了动员她那分开另过的嫂嫂。
    她满腔热情地对嫂嫂说：“嫂子，你出来干活吧。干活对国家对个人都有好处啊！”她嫂嫂只说了句“我孩子多，去不了呀！”就不理她这个茬了。虽然碰了钉子，她一点也不灰心，心想我要学“愚公移山”的精神，一次不成二次，二次不成三次，迟早我得把你给说活动了。于是她就跟她嫂嫂“泡”上了。得空见面就动员她，没想到，这反而惹她嫂嫂生了气。庆凤想：这个人太混，帮助不了啦。这以后就不理她嫂嫂了。
    党支部发现她这种情绪，及时找她谈话，并要她再看看《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇文章。
    她翻开了毛主席著作，看着看着，眼光一下子停在“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题”这句话上。庆凤想：对呀，我就是没有关心我嫂子的生活呀，她五个孩子，家务很重，可我光知道跟她说大道理，怪不得支书说我工作没有做到家呢！
    从此后，她嫂嫂孩子的衣服脏了，她帮着洗，回了家，她给嫂嫂打柴禾。她嫂嫂做饭，她一边给烧火，一边给她讲毛主席著作，讲她学习的心得感想。她们之间的谈话增加了新的内容，她们关系更亲密了。她嫂嫂在她的帮助下，安排好家务，参加了劳动。
    以后她又配合支部，挨家挨户动员妇女出来参加劳动，现在她们那儿妇女真正成了半边天。
