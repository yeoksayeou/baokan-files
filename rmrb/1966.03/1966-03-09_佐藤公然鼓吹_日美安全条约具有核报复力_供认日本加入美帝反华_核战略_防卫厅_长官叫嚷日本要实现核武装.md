    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th - Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, among others, openly admitted during a response at the Senate Budget Committee on the afternoon of the 7th that the Japanese government, through the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," has already joined the U.S. imperialist "nuclear strategy system" of "containing" China.

    Sato said, "The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty possesses nuclear retaliatory power," and it includes Japan accepting the "guarantee" of the U.S. using all weapons.

    Etsusaburo Shiina said: "The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is a 'family heirloom sword'," and "it can exert the strength (of all weapons)."

    The Director-General of the "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Minister of Defense), Ryozo Matsuno, clamored that Japan's "defense power" must consider carrying out "special reforms," implying that Japan should import nuclear weapons from the United States to achieve nuclear armament.

    At the same time, Matsuno once again attacked China's nuclear tests conducted for defense purposes. He nonsensically said, "If China's nuclear armament can proceed smoothly, it will be a threat to our country."

    The *Akahata* reported in a message on the 8th that Sato, Shiina, and others' speeches at the Senate Budget Committee were a step further than the Japanese government's openly admitting a few days ago that Japan had entered the United States' "nuclear umbrella" under a "unified view." It proves that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," through the joint statement signed by Sato with Johnson during his visit to the United States last January, has become a de facto "nuclear guarantee system." The Japanese government's statement about the "Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' possessing nuclear retaliatory power" and U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara's statement in the U.S. Senate on the 3rd that "the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty takes into consideration the danger of a U.S.-China war" show that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a completely offensive and aggressive treaty.

    It is reported that the Sato government, in order to accelerate the expansion of armaments and preparations for war, is planning to submit a series of draft laws to this National Diet to revive militarism. In addition to proposing the "Law on Cooperation with the United Nations" in order to create a "legal basis" for sending troops overseas, it is also preparing to submit to the Diet draft laws related to expanding military bases and upgrading the Japanese "Defense Agency" to the Ministry of Defense (Ministry of National Defense), as well as other draft laws. According to the *Akahata's* exposure, the establishment of the "Ministry of National Defense" is to transfer the authority to decide on dispatching troops to the Minister of Defense and to facilitate the formulation of various fascist decrees such as "handling emergency situations."

    佐藤公然鼓吹“日美安全条约具有核报复力”
    供认日本加入美帝反华“核战略”
    “防卫厅”长官叫嚷日本要实现核武装
    新华社东京八日电  日本首相佐藤荣作和外务大臣椎名悦三郎等人七日下午在参议院预算委员会答辩时，公开承认日本政府通过日美“安全条约”已经加入了美帝国主义“遏制”中国的“核战略体制”。
    佐藤说，“日美安全条约，具有核报复力”，它包括日本接受美国使用一切武器的“保障”。
    椎名悦三郎说：“日美安全条约是‘传家宝刀’”，“它可以发挥（所有武器的）实力”。
      “防卫厅”长官（相当于国防部长）松野赖三叫嚷说：日本的“防卫力量”，必须考虑进行“特殊的改革”，这暗示着日本要从美国引进核武器，实现核武装。
    同时，松野再一次攻击中国为了防御而进行的核试验。他胡说：“中国的核武装，如果能顺利地进行，对我国是个威胁”。
    《赤旗报》八日在一条消息中指出，佐藤、椎名等人在参议院预算委员会的发言，比前几天日本政府公然承认日本已经进入美国的“核保护伞”下的“统一见解”又进了一步。它证明日美“安全条约”通过去年一月佐藤访美时同约翰逊签定的共同声明已经成为实质上的“核保障体制”。日本政府关于“日美‘安全条约’具有核报复力”的发言和美国国防部长麦克纳马拉三日在美国参议院讲的“日美安全条约，考虑到美中战争的危险性”的话联系起来，说明日美“安全条约”完全是攻击性、侵略性的条约。
    据报道，佐藤政府为了加紧扩军备战，正策划向这次国会提出一系列复活军国主义的法律草案。它除了提出“与联合国合作法案”以便制造向海外派兵的“法律根据”外，还准备向国会提出有关扩大军事基地法案和把日本“防卫厅”升格为国防省（国防部）的法案以及其他法律草案。据《赤旗报》揭露，设置“国防省”是为了把决定出兵的权限交给国防大臣并且便利于制定“处理紧急事态”等各项法西斯法令。（附图片）
