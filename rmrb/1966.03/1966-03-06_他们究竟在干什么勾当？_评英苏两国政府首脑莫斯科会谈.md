What Exactly Are They Up To?
    —A Critique of the Moscow Talks Between the Heads of Government of Britain and the Soviet Union
    By Our Staff Commentator

    The British Labour government and the Soviet leaders are playing a very active role in promoting the Johnson government’s "peace talks" conspiracy. Following a series of mutual visits by high-ranking officials of Britain and the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Wilson visited the Soviet Union in late February and held talks with Soviet leaders such as Kosygin. This was the first contact between the heads of government of Britain and the Soviet Union since the new Soviet leadership came to power. The content of their talks was quite extensive, but the central topic was the Vietnam issue.

    The joint communiqué of the British-Soviet talks stated that both sides "frankly stated their respective views on the situation in Vietnam." At first glance, it seems that you talked about your views, and I talked about mine, and there was a great distance between the two sides. Is this really the case?

    The wording of the communiqué was indeed carefully crafted. However, Wilson, due to his own needs, still let the cat out of the bag. He said, "Our meeting was extremely beneficial"; he and Kosygin "agreed that military means cannot solve the Vietnam issue"; "Vietnam (issue) means a cloud constantly shrouding the overall relationship between East and West. But I think we very much hope to find ways and means to improve the situation, and they (referring to Moscow) believe they and we can play a role in this regard."

    During the British-Soviet talks, Wilson also sent his Minister of State, Chalfont, to contact the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Soviet Union. British newspapers said, "President Johnson and Kosygin both approved of Lord Chalfont's four-hour meeting with Le Trang, the (Vietnamese) envoy in Moscow—although Kosygin could not publicly admit this." After this contact, Wilson spread rumors and misled the public. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 25, sternly refuting it and accusing Wilson of exonerating U.S. imperialism’s war of aggression against Vietnam.

    It is now very clear what the British-Soviet Moscow talks were up to on the Vietnam issue.

    In fact, the Soviet leaders' involvement with the Labour government on the Vietnam issue did not start today. Over the past year, as the Johnson government has gradually expanded its war of aggression against Vietnam and repeatedly pursued the "peace talks" fraud, the British Labour government and the Soviet leaders have had frequent contacts, echoing each other and coordinating their actions.

    On February 7 last year, U.S. imperialism bombed North Vietnam in an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to stop resisting and surrender. Five days later, the British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs hurriedly flew to Moscow to hold urgent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the Vietnam issue. On February 16, the Soviet leaders formally proposed to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China to convene an international conference on Indochina without preconditions. Closely coordinated with the Soviet proposal, the British government sent a letter to the Soviet Union on February 20, suggesting that Britain and the Soviet Union, in their capacity as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, jointly solicit the opinions of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on the so-called "peaceful settlement" of the Vietnam issue. This scheme by the Soviet leaders and the Labour government failed. Because the Soviet proposal was rejected by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China; under such circumstances, the British proposal became stillborn.

    In April last year, the Soviet Union, in its capacity as one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, proposed convening an international conference on the Cambodian issue. Britain immediately responded to this. The purpose of this joint action by Britain and the Soviet Union was to attempt to use this conference as a channel to smuggle in Johnson's private goods of "unconditional discussions" on the Vietnam issue. This conspiracy was seen through by the Royal Government of Cambodia, thus declaring bankruptcy.

    In June last year, the Labour government launched a so-called Commonwealth "Peace Mission" in an attempt to peddle the Johnson government’s "peace talks" plan. At that time, the Soviet government handed a memorandum to this "mission," asking it to "put forward its own proposals" to the Vietnamese people. The Soviet leaders outwardly adopted a detached attitude, but in reality, they wanted the British government to exert pressure on the Vietnamese people. Wilson was well aware of this. He emphasized that Kosygin "asked our representatives to go to Hanoi," so Britain "has a responsibility to do this work by any means we can," in order to "create conditions for reconvening the Geneva Conference jointly presided over by Gromyko and Stewart." However, this conspiracy planned by the Labour government did not succeed. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly condemned Wilson’s despicable plot and refused to receive this so-called "Peace Mission."

    In late November and early December last year, the foreign ministers of Britain and the Soviet Union held talks in Moscow. The Soviet government specially arranged for Stewart to deliver a speech on Moscow Television. In his speech, the British Foreign Secretary openly requested that Britain and the Soviet Union together "convene a conference of the governments of all countries. Let this conference arrange a ceasefire as soon as possible." Stewart said more clearly after returning to London: "I have no doubt that the Soviet government, like us, is eager to end the fighting there (referring to Vietnam)."

    Look, one initiates, one responds; one openly acts, one secretly supports. How closely and harmoniously the Soviet leaders and the British Labour government cooperate!

    Extinguishing the flames of the Vietnamese people’s struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and inducing the Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and fall into the U.S.'s "peace talks" trap—this is what the Johnson government has racked its brains for and dreamed of. The British Labour government, out of its imperialist nature of hating national liberation movements and out of the need to rely on U.S. imperialism, actively acts as a loyal pawn of U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue. The Soviet leaders colluding with such a notorious U.S. pawn and taking joint action obviously also want to greatly help the Johnson government promote the "peace talks" fraud.

    Of course, the roles played by the British Labour government and the Soviet leaders are not entirely the same. The Wilson government is doing it blatantly. It applauded the U.S. imperialism expanding the war; it shouted for the U.S. imperialism promoting the "peace talks" fraud. The Soviet leaders have a different approach. They also utter a few words condemning U.S. imperialism and pretend to support the Vietnamese people. In order to win the trust of the Vietnamese people and the anti-imperialist people of the world, to facilitate control of the Vietnamese war of resistance, and to facilitate bargaining with U.S. imperialism, they sometimes also provide some military assistance to Vietnam. However, their real purpose is always to try every possible means to lead the Vietnamese people to the Johnson government’s "unconditional discussions" conference table, trying to realize a new "Munich" conspiracy.

    Facts over the past year show that the Soviet leaders’ approach to the Vietnam issue has become increasingly cunning. At first, they still came out in the open to carry out activities. The later it got, the more concealed their activities became. However, since the fox has such a huge tail, no matter how it hides it, it will always be revealed. People see that as long as Washington throws out a little new stuff, Moscow immediately or overtly or covertly actively acts and cooperates with it. Recently, Washington has played a card in the "peace talks" fraud, deliberately making some concessions on the issue of the status of the so-called National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. It was against this background that the leaders of Britain and the Soviet Union held talks in Moscow on the Vietnam issue. Although the Soviet leaders kept their mouths shut, it is not difficult to see what they are up to from Wilson’s activities and reactions in Moscow.

    The British and Soviet leaders serve U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue by using their status as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference. As we all know, it is the responsibility of the two chairmen to maintain the Geneva Accords. At present, U.S. imperialism is wantonly invading Vietnam, which has trampled the Geneva Accords beyond recognition. Under such circumstances, the two chairmen do not stop U.S. imperialism’s rampant aggression, but instead help the Johnson government peddle the "peace talks" fraud; they do not want the U.S. invading forces to withdraw from South Vietnam immediately, but instead want the Vietnamese people to stop resisting. This shows that they do not want to solve the Vietnam issue on the basis of maintaining the Geneva Accords at all, but want the Vietnamese people to tolerate the U.S.'s occupation of South Vietnam and tolerate the U.S.'s division of Vietnam. Such chairmen have long abandoned their due positions and have degenerated into accomplices in U.S. imperialism’s aggression against Vietnam.

    The British and Soviet leaders collude with each other, each with its own plans. Wilson attempts to use this to play the role of the so-called "liaison between East and West" in order to enhance the value of the Labour government and gain political capital. The Soviet leaders want to use this channel to facilitate their transactions with U.S. imperialism and bring the Vietnam issue into the orbit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. However, all these plans will eventually be just a pipe dream. This is because U.S. imperialism has fallen deeply into the quagmire of aggression against Vietnam and cannot extricate itself. No matter who acts alone or colludes with others, as long as they act as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, the result will be the same as that of U.S. imperialism, ending up in disgrace.

    他们究竟在干什么勾当？
    ——评英苏两国政府首脑莫斯科会谈
    本报评论员
    英国工党政府和苏联领导人，在推行约翰逊政府“和谈”阴谋的活动中，起着十分活跃的作用。英苏两国高级官员接连互访之后，英国首相威尔逊又于二月下旬访苏，同柯西金等苏联领导人举行了会谈。这是苏联新领导上台以后英苏两国政府首脑第一次进行接触。他们会谈的内容相当广泛，但是，中心的议题是越南问题。
    英苏会谈公报说，双方“坦率地阐述了自己对越南局势的有关观点”。乍看之下，似乎是你谈你的，我讲我的，两家之间距离很大。事情果真是这样吗？
    公报的措词真是煞费了苦心。但是，威尔逊由于自己的需要，还是走漏了口风。他说，“我们的会晤是极其有益的”；他和柯西金“一致认为，军事手段不能解决越南问题”；“越南（问题）意味着不断笼罩着东西方总的关系的乌云。可是我认为，我们十分希望找到改善局势的方式方法，他们（指莫斯科）认为他们和我们在这方面可起作用”。
    在英苏会谈期间，威尔逊还派遣他的国务大臣查尔方特，同越南民主共和国驻苏联大使馆临时代办进行了接触。英国报纸说，“约翰逊总统和柯西金都赞成查尔方特勋爵和（越南）驻莫斯科使节黎庄的四小时会谈，——虽然柯西金不能公开承认这一点。”在这次接触之后，威尔逊大放其风，造谣惑众。越南民主共和国外交部已于二月二十五日发表声明，严正地予以驳斥，并指责威尔逊为美帝国主义侵略越南战争开脱罪责。
    英苏莫斯科会谈在越南问题上究竟在搞些什么名堂，这就十分清楚了。
    事实上，苏联领导同工党政府在越南问题上拉拉扯扯，并非自今日始。一年来，随着约翰逊政府一步步扩大侵略越南战争，一次次推行“和谈”骗局，英国工党政府和苏联领导人进行了频繁的接触，相互呼应，配合行动。
    去年二月七日，美帝国主义轰炸越南北方，企图迫使越南人民停止抵抗，屈膝投降。五天以后，英国外交国务大臣急忙飞往莫斯科，同苏联外长葛罗米柯就越南问题举行紧急会谈。二月十六日，苏联领导就向越南民主共和国和中国正式建议，召开印度支那问题的没有先决条件的国际会议。同苏联的建议密切配合，英国政府二月二十日致函苏联，建议英苏以日内瓦会议两主席身份联合出面，就所谓“和平解决”越南问题征求一九五四年日内瓦会议参加国的意见。苏联领导和工党政府的这一策划，没有得逞。因为苏联的建议遭到了越南民主共和国和中国拒绝；在这种情况下，英国的建议，也就成了死胎。
    去年四月间，苏联又以日内瓦会议两主席之一的身份，建议召开有关柬埔寨问题的国际会议。对此，英国马上响应。英、苏这个联合行动的目的，是企图利用这一会议作为渠道，来偷运约翰逊“无条件讨论”越南问题的私货。这个阴谋被柬埔寨王国政府识破，从而宣告破产。
    去年六月，工党政府搞了一个所谓英联邦“和平使团”，力图兜售约翰逊政府的“和谈”方案。当时，苏联政府曾把一份备忘录交给这个“使团”，要它向越南人民“提出自己的建议”。苏联领导人表面上采取了超然的态度，实际上是要英国政府向越南人民施加压力。对此，威尔逊是心领神会的。他强调说：柯西金“叫我们的代表去河内”，因此英国“有责任通过我们所能有的任何手段来做这一工作”，以便“为重新召开葛罗米柯和斯图尔特共同主持下的日内瓦会议创造条件”。但是，工党政府策划的这一阴谋，并没有成功，越南民主共和国政府严正地谴责了威尔逊的卑鄙图谋，并且拒绝接待这个所谓
  “和平使团”。
    去年十一月底、十二月初，英、苏两国外长在莫斯科会谈。苏联政府特别安排斯图尔特在莫斯科电视台发表演说。这位英国外交大臣在演说中公开要求英、苏一起“召开一次有关各国政府的会议。让这个会议尽快地安排停火”。斯图尔特回到伦敦之后说得更明白：“我不怀疑苏联政府如同我们一样切望使那里（指越南）的战斗结束”。
    请看，一个倡议，一个响应；一个公开活动，一个暗中支持。苏联领导人同英国工党政府一搭一档，配合得多么紧密，多么协调！
    扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火，诱骗越南人民放下武器，使他们落入美国的“和谈”圈套，这是约翰逊政府绞尽脑汁、梦寐以求的。英国工党政府出于仇视民族解放运动的帝国主义本性，出于投靠美帝国主义的需要，在越南问题上积极充当美帝国主义的忠实走卒。苏联领导人同这样一个臭名远扬的美国走卒互相勾结，联合行动，显然也要在约翰逊政府推行“和谈”骗局的活动中大帮其忙。
    当然，英国工党政府和苏联领导人扮演的角色，并不完全相同。威尔逊政府是明目张胆地干。美帝国主义扩大战争，它拍手叫好；美帝国主义推行“和谈”骗局，它奔走呼号。而苏联领导人则另有一番做法。他们口头上也讲几句谴责美帝国主义的话，装出一副支持越南人民的姿态。为着骗取越南人民和世界反帝人民的信任，为着便于控制越南抗战局势，更为着便于同美帝国主义讨价还价，他们有时还给越南一些军事援助。但是，他们真正的目的总是千方百计地企图把越南人民引向约翰逊政府“无条件讨论”的会议桌旁，力图实现新的“慕尼黑”阴谋。
    从一年来的事实可以看出，苏联领导人在越南问题上的做法越来越狡猾了。起初，他们还抛头露面地活动。越到后来，他们的活动就越加隐蔽。但是，狐狸既然有一个偌大的尾巴，不管它怎样掩藏，总是要露出来的。人们看到，只要华盛顿抛出一点新货色，莫斯科立即或明或暗地积极活动，加以配合。最近华盛顿又在“和谈”骗局方面打出一张牌，故意在所谓越南南方民族解放阵线的地位问题作了一些松动。就是在这种背景下，英、苏两国领导人在莫斯科就越南问题举行了会谈。虽然苏联领导人守口如瓶，但是从威尔逊在莫斯科的活动和反应，不难看出他们究竟在干什么勾当。
    英、苏两国领导人在越南问题上为美帝国主义效劳，是利用他们作为日内瓦会议两主席的身份进行的。众所周知，维护日内瓦协议是两主席的职责。目前，美帝国主义肆无忌惮地侵略越南，已经把日内瓦协议践踏得不成样子。在这种情况下，两主席不去制止美帝国主义穷凶极恶的侵略，反而帮助约翰逊政府兜售“和谈”骗局；不是要美国侵略军立即撤出南越，反而要越南人民停止抵抗。这就表明，他们根本不是要在维护日内瓦协议的基础上解决越南问题，而是要越南人民容忍美国霸占南越，容忍美国分裂越南。这样的两主席，早已抛弃了他们所应有的立场，而堕落成为美帝国主义侵略越南的帮手。
    英、苏两国领导人互相勾结，是各有一番打算的。威尔逊企图借此起所谓“东西方联系人”的作用，以抬高工党政府的身价，捞取政治资本。苏联领导人是要利用这条渠道，更便于他们同美帝国主义进行交易，把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道。但是，所有这些打算，到头来，终将是春梦一场。这是因为，美帝国主义已深深地陷入侵略越南的泥坑而不能自拔。不管什么人，单独行动也好，串同一气也好，只要是充当美帝国主义的帮手，其结果，将同美帝国主义一样，落得个身败名裂的下场。
