    “It's Handing Over the Shift, Not Ditching the Shift”
    Beijing First Machine Tool Plant　Wang Enxi
    My master retired more than two years ago, but he still often comes to the group to be a quality improvement consultant and a technical innovation advisor. That's not all, he often uses a scar on his waist to educate us, to remind us what class is and what class struggle is. Some people advised him: Since you're retired, rest more at home. He replied, "The factory is my home. My retirement is handing over the shift, not ditching the shift."
      "It's handing over the shift, not ditching the shift," what a weight these words carry! Revolutionary elders always hope that the next generation will grow up healthy and take over the revolutionary shift well. Grandma Li in *The Red Lantern* is like that. When she saw Tie Mei holding up the red lantern, bravely fighting the class enemies, she felt very happy. How can young people take over the revolutionary shift well and shoulder the revolutionary burden, both quickly and steadily? This certainly depends on the degree of their own efforts, but it also requires the passionate care and cultivation of the older generation, to pass on revolutionary thought, revolutionary style, revolutionary methods, and revolutionary traditions to the next generation, to help them take over the revolutionary shift well. This is the lofty responsibility of the revolutionary older generation, and it is also the thorough revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary older generation.
    Handing over the shift is a century-long plan for the revolutionary cause. We of the older generation must hand over this shift well.

### “是交班，不是甩班”

    “是交班，不是甩班”
    北京第一机床厂　王恩熙
    我师傅退休两年多了，可是他还常常到小组里来，做提高质量的顾问，做技术革新的参谋。这还不算，他还时常用他腰间的一块伤疤，教育我们，要我们记住什么是阶级，什么是阶级斗争。有人劝他：退休了就在家里多休息吧。他回答说：“工厂就是我的家，我退休，是交班，不是甩班。”
      “是交班，不是甩班”，这话说得多么有分量啊！革命的老人总是希望下一代健康地成长起来，接好革命的班。《红灯记》中的李奶奶就是这样的。她看到铁梅高举红灯，勇敢地和阶级敌人战斗下去时，心情非常喜悦。青年人怎样才能接好革命班，挑起革命重担来，既走得快，又走得稳，这固然要看自己努力的程度如何，但是也很需要老一辈的热情关怀和培养，把革命的思想、革命的作风、革命的方法和革命的传统交给下一代，帮助他们接好革命的班。这是革命老一辈人的崇高责任，也是革命老一辈人的彻底革命精神。
    交班是革命事业的百年大计。我们老一辈人，可要把这个班交好。
