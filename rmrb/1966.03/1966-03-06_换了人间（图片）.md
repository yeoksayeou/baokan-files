    The World Transformed
    Sketches from Jinan Match Factory Chen Hongren
    The Party's Kindness is Endless
    To ensure the health of the workers, the factory's medical personnel regularly make rounds in the workshops. The workers say: "Without knowing the bitterness of the past, it's hard to appreciate the sweetness of today." Today, the lives of the workers are cared for by the Party in every way.
    Reading Chairman Mao's Books
    In the packaging workshop, the female workers are concentrating on reading Chairman Mao's works. They take the women of Daqing and Dazhai as their models, placing the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought as the top priority in all work, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Advanced work groups are constantly emerging in the workshop.
    Grasping the Gun Tightly
    Just as dawn breaks, the militia of the match factory are drilling. In the midst of busy production, they still train hard in the skills of killing the enemy, so that if the enemy dares to invade, they will be smashed to pieces!
    Bearing the Motherland in Mind and Keeping the World in View
    Entering the match stick workshop, the workers are packing boxes. The workers say: We produce match sticks for the construction of our motherland and also to support the world revolution.

    换了人间
    济宁火柴厂速写　陈宏仁
    党的恩情说不完
    为保证工人的身体健康，工厂的医务人员经常到车间来巡回医疗。工人们说：不知昔日苦，难知今日甜。今天工人的生活处处得到了党的关怀。
    读毛主席的书
    在包装车间，女工们正在聚精会神地读毛主席著作。她们以大庆、大寨妇女为榜样，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，车间里不断涌现出先进班组。
    紧握手中枪
    天刚亮，火柴厂的民兵就在操练。在繁忙的生产中，他们仍苦练杀敌本领，敌人胆敢来侵犯，就打它个稀巴烂！
    胸怀祖国放眼世界
    走进火柴梗车间，工人们正在打包装箱。工人们说：我们生产火柴梗，为了建设祖国，也为了支援世界革命。
