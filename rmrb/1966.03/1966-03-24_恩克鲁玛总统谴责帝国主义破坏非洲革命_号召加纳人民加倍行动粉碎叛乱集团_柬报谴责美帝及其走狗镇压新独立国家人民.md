    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 21st—President Nkrumah, in a speech broadcast again to the Ghanaian people on the "Voice of the African Revolution" radio station in Guinea on the evening of the 20th, condemned imperialism for instigating a handful of Ghanaian military and police officers to launch a rebellion in an attempt to strangle Ghana and undermine the African revolution, and called on the Ghanaian people to redouble their efforts to smash the rebel clique.

    He said, "The rebellion launched by certain army and police officers in Ghana under instigation is directed not only against Ghana, but also against the African revolution and the unity and independence of our continent. They hope to strangle Ghana and undermine the African revolution through this irresponsible action."

    Nkrumah said that Ghana had indicated to its African brother countries that "unless Africa is politically united, it will never truly escape foreign interference and control. We also warned that imperialism and neocolonialism would turn some of us into lackeys and traitors in order to undermine and subvert the revolution in Africa and the existence of independent African countries. This has become our main foreign policy, and it is what we have been loudly calling for on the African continent." He pointed out that since Ghana's independence, the enemy has tried every possible means to make Ghana submit to them. He said that this rebellion attempts to strike at the achievements we have made. They are striking at Ghana and the African revolution, but they cannot succeed. We will not let them succeed.

    Nkrumah condemned the rebels' cruelty, massacre, and barbaric viciousness.

    Nkrumah pointed out that "these crimes committed by this small group of crazy military and police officers cannot escape the condemnation of the people and the responsibility for them, and they must not go unpunished."

    Nkrumah said that the rebel clique "attempts to justify their rebellion with lies, and uses torture and intimidation to force and coerce upright citizens to submit to them." He said, "No matter how many lies and slanders there are, they cannot absolve them of the guilt for their unjustified killings or allow them to escape the punishment they deserve."

    Nkrumah called on the Ghanaian people to redouble their efforts to "smash this gang of military and police bandits." He said, "We must use every means to overthrow these adventurers and selfish individuals. I will soon be with you, and together we will carry the revolutionary struggle through to the end with renewed spirit and energy."

    He said, "We are not isolated in this revolutionary struggle against the enemies of progress and freedom." He said, "Do not be intimidated by the rifles and submachine guns used by these traitors to scare you. They know that they are powerless in the face of your united strength."

    Nkrumah finally called on the Ghanaian people to swiftly smash the rebel clique before they bring greater destruction to Ghana and create chaos in the African revolution. Forever forward, never backward.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 19th—The *Cambodge Soir* published a commentary on the 19th, pointing out that US imperialism and its lackeys have consistently used the name of "freedom" to massacre, oppress, and plunder the masses of the people and democratic forces in newly independent countries, and that the people must be prepared to use a just war to counter an unjust war. The commentary stated that in South Vietnam, Indonesia, and some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the reactionary forces colluding with American interests have never ceased to implement a policy of oppression and suppression against the people. In order to cover up their crimes, the imperialists and their lackeys are always shouting "freedom" in front of the people of various countries.

    The commentary pointed out that the imperialists and their lackeys always use two-pronged tactics to achieve their sinister goals: the tactics of war and the tactics of "peace." "These two-pronged tactics serve the purpose of massacring, suppressing, and exploiting the masses of the people and democratic forces."

    The commentary emphasized that in the face of the deception and brutality of imperialism and the reactionaries, the forces that love peace and uphold justice must also use two-pronged tactics to counter the enemy's conspiracies. On the one hand, it is necessary to thoroughly expose the deceptive means of "peace" and "freedom" used by the imperialists and their lackeys; "on the other hand, it is necessary to be prepared to use violence when necessary to stop all the atrocities of the fascists and their accomplices—in other words, it is necessary to be prepared to wage a just war in the event that the American imperialists and their lackeys launch an unjust war."

    恩克鲁玛总统谴责帝国主义破坏非洲革命
    号召加纳人民加倍行动粉碎叛乱集团
    柬报谴责美帝及其走狗镇压新独立国家人民
    新华社科纳克里二十一日电 恩克鲁玛总统二十日晚在几内亚“非洲革命之声”电台再次向加纳人民发表讲话，谴责帝国主义唆使一小撮加纳军警发动叛乱企图扼杀加纳和破坏非洲革命，并且号召加纳人民加倍行动，粉碎叛乱集团。
    他说，“加纳某些陆军军官和警官受人唆使而发动的叛乱不仅是针对加纳，而且是针对非洲革命以及我们大陆的统一和独立的。他们希望通过这种不负责任的行动来扼杀加纳和破坏非洲革命。”
    恩克鲁玛说：加纳曾向非洲兄弟国家表明，“除非非洲在政治上联合起来，否则决不会真正摆脱外国的干涉和控制。我们还警告说，帝国主义和新殖民主义会把我们中间的一些人变成走狗和卖国贼，以便破坏和颠覆非洲的革命和非洲独立国家的存在。这已成为我们的主要的外交政策，这是我们一直向非洲大陆大声疾呼的。”他指出，自从加纳独立以来，敌人千方百计地想使加纳屈从于他们。他说：这次叛乱企图打击我们所取得的成就。他们打击加纳和非洲革命，但是他们不能得逞。我们不让他们得逞。
    恩克鲁玛谴责叛乱者的残酷、屠杀和野蛮的凶恶行为。
    恩克鲁玛指出，“这一小撮疯狂的军警所犯下的这些罪行是无法逃脱人们的谴责和对此所负的责任的，他们决不能逍遥法外。”
    恩克鲁玛说，叛乱集团“企图用撒谎来为他们的叛变行为辩解，用拷打和恫吓来强迫和强制正直的公民向他们屈服”。他说，“不管多少谎言和诽谤，都不能为他们的毫无道理的杀人行动开脱罪责或者使他们逃脱应受的惩罚。”
    恩克鲁玛号召加纳人民加倍行动，“粉碎这个军警匪盗集团”。他说，“我们必须用一切办法来推翻这些冒险者和自私自利的人。我很快就要同你们在一起，我们将在一起用新的精神和精力来把革命斗争进行到底。”
    他说，“我们在这场反对进步和自由的敌人的革命斗争中不是孤立的”。他说，“你们不要被这些卖国贼用来吓唬你们的步枪和轻机枪所吓倒。他们知道，他们在你们的团结一致的力量面前是无能为力的。”
    恩克鲁玛最后号召加纳人民在叛乱集团对加纳带来更大的破坏和在非洲革命中间制造混乱以前，迅速粉碎他们。永远前进，决不后退。
    新华社金边十九日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》十九日发表评论指出，美帝国主义及其走狗一贯借“自由”为名，对新独立国家的人民群众和民主力量进行屠杀、压迫和掠夺，人民要准备用正义的战争对付非正义的战争。评论说：在越南南方、印度尼西亚和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一些国家里，同美国利益勾结在一起的反动势力一刻也没有停止对人民实行压迫和镇压的政策。为了掩盖他们的罪行，帝国主义者及其走狗总是在各国人民面前高喊“自由”。
    评论指出：帝国主义者及其走狗总是使用两手策略来达到他们的罪恶目的：这就是战争的策略与“和平”的策略。“这两手策略都是为屠杀、镇压和剥削人民群众和民主力量这一目的服务的”。
    评论强调指出：面对着帝国主义、反动派的欺骗和残暴手段，热爱和平与主持正义的力量必须同样使用两手策略来对付敌人的阴谋。一方面，必须彻底揭露帝国主义者及其走狗利用的“和平”与“自由”的欺骗手段，“另一方面，必须准备在必要时使用暴力来制止法西斯主义者及其合伙者的一切暴行——换句话说，就是必须准备在美帝国主义者及其走狗发动一场非正义战争的情况下，进行一场正义的战争。”
