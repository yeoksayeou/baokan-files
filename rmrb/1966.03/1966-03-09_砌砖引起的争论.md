    The Argument Caused by Bricklaying
    Not long ago, a quality inspection and evaluation was conducted on the bricklaying project at the Changchun Cotton Textile Factory construction site. It was discovered that a apprentice bricklayer achieved 100% mortar adhesion, while a senior bricklayer only achieved 80%. Some people thought that the apprentice's good bricklaying was "coincidental," and the senior worker's substandard work was a "temporary oversight." Others disagreed: If only one brick laid by the apprentice was good, it might be a coincidence. But why were all three bricks checked full of mortar and evenly spaced? If only one brick laid by the senior worker was bad, it could be considered a temporary carelessness. But why were several checked, all with poor compression? After debate, the answer was reached:
    These two people were laying bricks on the same wall, doing the same job, but their thoughts were different. The senior worker accepted the task with the intention of "demonstration" and "grabbing extra pay". He was focused on becoming an "advanced" worker and laying bricks to earn money. He abandoned the advanced operating method of "one shovel of mortar, one brick, knead it well", and rushed for quantity using the old method of spreading a large layer of mortar, which affected the bricklaying quality. The apprentice was not like that. He was determined to be a red successor, earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works, wanting to master the technique faster, and build more and better buildings for the country. Therefore, although his operation was not as skilled as his master, he had a red heart to serve the people and treated the project quality meticulously, resulting in good walls.
    In a word, because they positioned politics and technology differently, the products they produced were different. Liu Jiade
      Editor's note: This argument is very enlightening. Small things illustrate great principles: No matter how superb a person's professional skills are, if they do not correctly position politics and technology, and do not use proletarian politics to command technology, they cannot use their technology to serve socialist construction well.

### 砌砖引起的争论

    砌砖引起的争论
    不久前，在长春棉纺织厂工地上，对砌筑工程质量，作了一次检查评比。大家发现，一个学徒工砌的砖，粘灰面达到百分之百；一个高级工砌的砖，粘灰面只达到百分之八十。有人认为，学徒工砌出了这么好的墙面，是“碰巧”；高级工出次品，是“一时疏忽”。有人提出不同的看法：如果学徒工砌的砖只有一块好，可能是碰巧，为什么一连检查三块，块块都是浆满缝匀呢？如果高级工砌的砖只有一块不好，算是一时大意，为什么一连检查了几块，块块压实面都不好呢？争论之后得出了答案：
    这两个人同在一道墙上砌砖，干的是一个活，心里想的却不是一回事。高级工是抱着“示范”和“抓额字”（超额工资）的念头接受任务的。他一心想当“先进”，为挣钱而砌砖，丢掉了“一铲灰一块砖揉一揉”的先进操作方法，用老一套大铺灰的操作方法赶数量，结果影响了砌砖质量。学徒工不是这样。他决心做一个红色的接班人，认真地学习毛主席著作，想更快地掌握技术，为国家建设更多更好的建筑物。因此，尽管他在操作上还不如师傅熟练，由于他有一颗为人民服务的红心，对待工程质量一丝不苟，结果砌出了好的墙面。
    一句话，由于政治与技术的位置摆得不同，他们生产出来的产品就不同。  刘家德
      编者注：这场争论对人很有启发。小事情说明了大道理：一个人的专业技术不管多么高超，如果不把政治和技术的位置摆正，不用无产阶级政治统帅技术，他就不可能用自己的技术，很好地为社会主义建设服务。
