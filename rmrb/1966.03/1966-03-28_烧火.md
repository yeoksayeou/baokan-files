　　Burning Firewood
　　Lan Guifeng, Zhuang Worker of Liuzhou Zinc Plant
　　Early in the morning, I went to work. Just as I entered the locker room, Comrade Zhang Kangren, the team leader, said to me gently, "Old Lan, you're on firewood duty today. Get ready, and we'll clear the furnace right away."
　　I walked to the furnace, holding an iron rod in my hand. Just as I was about to open the furnace door, my heart started pounding for some reason. I thought, is the team leader going to a meeting today? Why else would he ask me to burn firewood? Although this thing isn't anything particularly difficult, it's my first time, so I couldn't help but feel flustered, afraid that I wouldn't be able to control the temperature and it would affect the quality. The more I thought about it, the faster my heart beat, and the iron rod trembled in my hand.
　　"Old Lan, when clearing the furnace, be careful to leave a little more red slag, so that the temperature won't be affected by clearing the furnace."
　　The team leader's words woke me up. I looked back and realized that the team leader was standing behind me.
　　Following the team leader's instructions, I quickly finished clearing the furnace. After clearing the furnace, it was time to add coal. Before, when I watched the team leader add coal, it seemed so easy, but now, as soon as I picked up the iron shovel, my hand started to tremble. When I threw coal into the furnace, the shovel always hit the furnace opening, and coal dust fell like a wind and rain onto the furnace floor. In the end, with great difficulty, I managed to throw the coal in.
　　I wiped my sweat and said to the team leader:
　　"Team leader, are you going to a meeting today?"
　　"I'm not going anywhere," the team leader said.
　　"Then why did you ask me to burn firewood!"
　　"Have you forgotten? Aren't we trying to achieve technical balance for all members of the team? Asking you to burn firewood today is precisely for this purpose. Especially now that we are carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, how can we do it if our technical skills don't keep up?"
　　The team leader probably saw the difficulty on my face, so he pointed:
　　"Look!"
　　I followed the team leader's finger and saw a huge red banner on the wall that read "Standing before the furnace, keep the world in view."
　　Instantly, a surge of hot blood rushed to my brain, and I felt my whole body burning. I seemed to hear the cries of the oppressed class brothers; I seemed to see the world's revolutionary people resisting imperialism...
　　The team leader said excitedly, "Every time we see this banner, we feel the great responsibility of the revolution!"
　　The team leader smiled and patted me on the shoulder, saying:
　　"Old Lan, burning firewood isn't as difficult as the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, is it?"
　　My heart suddenly brightened: That's right! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words. The Foolish Old Man could move two great mountains, and I am a worker of the socialist era. I should and can overcome any difficulty! So, I straightened my chest and said, "Team leader, I am determined to learn how to burn firewood!"
　　From then on, every time the team leader finished an operation, he would explain it to me and demonstrate it repeatedly. Under the team leader's patient guidance, I quickly learned how to burn firewood. Now, whenever I burn the furnace fire brightly, the motor roars cheerfully, and the furnace fire laughs, I feel an indescribable joy in my heart.

    烧火
    柳州锌品厂壮族工人  蓝桂丰
    清早，我去上班。刚走进更衣室，班长张康仁同志温和地对我说：“老蓝，今天你烧火，准备好，马上清炉。”
    我走到炉子旁边，手拿着一根铁棍，刚要打开炉门，不知怎的，心里蹦蹦直跳。我想，班长今天可能去开会吧？要不怎么叫我烧火呢？这玩艺儿虽说不是什么奇难的事，但对我来说，却是头一遭，因此心中不免发慌，怕温度掌握不好，影响质量，越想心越跳，铁棍在手上颤抖。
      “老蓝，清炉的时候，要注意多留点红渣，这样，就不会因清炉而影响温度。”
    班长一句话，点醒了我。我往后一看，才知道班长站在我身后。
    照着班长的话去干，很快就清完了炉。清炉之后，就是投煤。以前我看班长投煤的时候，很顺手，可是我呢，现在一抓起铁铲手就打颤。往炉子投煤时，铁铲总是碰着炉门口，煤粉象刮风落雨似的往炉底洒落，最后好不容易，才勉强把煤投了进去。
    我抹了抹汗，对班长说：
      “班长，今天你是不是要去开会？”
    “那里我也不去。”班长说。
      “那为什么要我烧火！”
    “你忘了吗？我们不是要使全班所有人员达到技术平衡吗？今天叫你烧火，正是为了这个。尤其目前我们正进行增产节约运动，假使我们技术跟不上去，怎么能行呢？”
    班长大概见我面有难色，于是顺手一指：
    “你看！”
    我顺着班长的手指看去，看到墙壁上“站在炉前，放眼世界”的红色的巨幅标语。
    刹时，一股热血冲激我的脑腔，我直觉得浑身滚热。我仿佛听到，被压迫阶级弟兄的呐喊；我仿佛看到，世界革命人民对帝国主义的反抗……
    班长激动地说：“每看这幅标语，我们就会感到革命责任重大！”
    班长又微笑着，拍拍我的肩膀说：
      “老蓝，烧火这工作，不比愚公移山那么难吧？”
    我心里豁然一亮：对呀！我们要听毛主席的话。愚公能移走两座大山，我是社会主义时代的工人，什么困难都应该而且能够克服！于是，我挺起胸膛说：“班长，我坚决要学会烧火！”
    从此以后，班长每逢操作完一次，就同我讲一次，不断地做示范。在班长的耐心指导下，我很快就学会了烧火。现在，每当我把炉火烧旺，马达欢叫，炉火欢笑的时候，我心里总有说不出来的愉快。
