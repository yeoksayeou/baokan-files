    Editor's Note: The January issue of Shanghai's *Academic Monthly* published "Discussions on 'Upright Officials.'" The following are excerpts from the discussions.

    Zhou Gucheng: "Upright officials" and corrupt officials are birds of a feather, but they are not entirely without distinction. Even if "upright officials" have their merits, they are ultimately insignificant.

    Regarding so-called upright officials and corrupt officials: (1) Since both so-called upright officials and corrupt officials are tools of the ruling class, it wouldn't be very unfair to say they are birds of a feather, or that there is no difference between them. (2) However, under the premise of oppressing and exploiting the people, it is not in accordance with the facts to say that there is absolutely no difference between upright officials and corrupt officials. It is always better to have less oppression than more oppression, and less exploitation than more exploitation. Furthermore, although upright officials and corrupt officials are both tools for oppressing and exploiting the people, if upright officials can use political power to force the people to build water conservancy projects, etc., thereby developing production, it is not entirely without benefit to the people. In this sense, a so-called upright official, as long as they can truly do a little good, is ultimately better than a corrupt official by a small margin. (3) However, the actions of upright officials may provide temporary and minor benefits to the people; in return, they prolong or consolidate the ruling class itself, which is completely contrary to the people's desire to overthrow the ruling class and thoroughly eliminate oppression and exploitation. This is a function that corrupt officials cannot perform. In this sense, the so-called upright official who always serves the ruling class, even if they have merits, their merits are ultimately insignificant, or even cannot compensate for their crimes.

    Regarding so-called "affirmation" and "negation": (1) Judging from the current usage, affirmation and negation seem to refer entirely to the scope of evaluation, and are not the same thing as historical existence or non-existence. The influence of historical figures or events may change due to evaluation; but their existence will not become non-existent due to a negative evaluation. (2) The current so-called evaluation is mostly re-evaluation. For example, if someone was evaluated too highly in the past, negate part or all of them; if someone was evaluated too lowly in the past, affirm part or all of them. Times have changed, and evaluations will naturally be different. However, the existence of historical figures or events themselves, or, on a broader scale, the existence of history itself, will not change due to evaluation. (3) When we study history, we value the discovery of laws the most, and we value the elucidation of the inevitable trend of historical development the most. When the trend is clear, it is much easier to evaluate figures. However, having a clear understanding of the actions of key figures directly helps in discovering laws and elucidating trends.

    Ping Xin: It is absurd to erase the boundary between upright officials and the people, but it is also unconvincing to erase the distinction between them and corrupt officials and powerful gentry. There are two standards for criticizing upright officials: one is present political right and wrong; the other is historical right and wrong.

    "Good ministers" and "circumspect officials" who were honest and self-disciplined, dared to speak out in court, built water conservancy projects, supported agricultural affairs, rectified officialdom, reduced and exempted taxes, and were relatively concerned about the people's hardships are recorded throughout history. Many of their "virtuous deeds" and "exemplary actions" have been embellished and exaggerated by historians. However, historical records reveal the style of upright officials that differed from general feudal bureaucrats to some extent. It is obviously inconsistent with historical truth to regard them as birds of a feather with the violent and corrupt officials, powerful traitors, and powerful gentry of their time. Upright officials had in common with general officials of the feudal state that they served the feudal ruling class, but they also had aspects that differed from them and even contradicted each other. If the latter is exaggerated, and the boundary between upright officials and the people is erased with a single stroke, it is of course absurd. However, if only the former is seen, and the boundary between them and evil officials and powerful gentry is erased altogether, it will not be convincing.

    The main mistake of Comrade Wu Han lies in obliterating the boundary between upright officials and the people, thereby abstracting the state and laws used by the feudal landlord class to oppress the people; at the same time, he seriously distorted the historical image of the Ming Dynasty peasants and eliminated the role of the people in historical struggle. This kind of "using the past to serve the present" eulogy and judgment cannot but have extremely bad effects on current socialist politics.

    Can we, because Comrade Wu Han made mistakes on the Hai Rui issue, go to another extreme and indiscriminately smear upright officials in history? This is an important issue related to commenting on historical right and wrong.

    The so-called "circumspect officials" and "good officials" in history should have been analyzed specifically and evaluated separately, and not treated in general terms. Among them, there are indeed some idealized figures who have been excessively beautified by the ruling class and are merely nominal. Their destructive and corrupting effects in history far outweighed their positive effects, and even some so-called famous ministers' "benevolent governance and virtuous achievements" are simply fabricated historical scandals. For them, there is only the part of derogation. However, among the so-called upright officials, there are indeed many who have done some beneficial things for the people, alleviated some of the people's pain and disasters, and some of their achievements have even left good effects on later generations (such as developing agricultural production, building water conservancy projects, and protecting water and soil). How can they be devalued to nothing simply because they were loyal to the dynasty and the interests of the entire ruling class at the time? If putting upright officials on the ninth heaven is committing a right-leaning error, is putting them all into the eighteenth level of hell committing a "left"-leaning error?

    Should upright officials like Hai Rui be criticized? There is no doubt that it is necessary. There are two standards for criticism: one is based on the right and wrong of current politics, and the other is based on the right and wrong of past history. If any upright official firmly defended the entire exploiting class at the time, numbed and suppressed the people, and hindered the development of history; if he stubbornly maintained the traditional system that violated the interests of the working people and the track of social progress, then this should not only be regarded as being in a position of opposition to the masses of the people at the time, but should also be regarded as belonging to two opposing camps with the modern working people, and be regarded as the distant ancestors (here not referring to the distant ancestors of blood relations, but referring to the distant ancestors of class relations) and predecessors of the modern exploiting class. Which side should our thoughts and feelings stand on? This inevitably involves the issue of right and wrong in current politics.

    However, historical figures are, after all, ancient people who have passed away. We cannot use today's proletarian political scale to measure them and demand that they treat the people in the same way as today's revolutionary politicians; we must carefully analyze and treat them separately based on the specific historical conditions at the time. If someone believes that all upright officials are historical sinners, and there is not the slightest difference between them and all corrupt officials, powerful traitors, and national vermin, then that is a complete vulgarization of Marxism. Is it possible that the proletariat only cares about the right and wrong of current politics and ignores historical right and wrong? I cannot agree with this prejudice that seriously distorts the Marxist class view.

    Shu Shiheng: I disagree that "upright officials" are self-regulating devices of the feudal system. The greatness of "upright officials" is a political fantasy of the feudal rulers. The standard for evaluating "upright officials" should be whether they are beneficial to the social production of the time.

    The so-called "upright official" is only a product of feudal society, mostly appearing after the middle of each dynasty. Some say that upright officials are a kind of self-regulating device of the feudal system in the process of intensifying contradictions. I cannot fully agree with this point of view. The so-called upright official refers to local officials (good officials, circumspect officials). The influence of individual local officials can only be temporary and local, and cannot play a regulatory role in the overall political situation of the dynasty, let alone play a regulatory role in the "feudal system."

    The situation of upright officials is somewhat special. Although its influence is small, it has a false name, and this false name becomes larger and larger after his death. This is a "political fantasy". It is clear from the history of the famous upright officials Bao Zheng and Hai Rui. The feudal system needs to use political fantasies to rule. After the class contradictions are intensified, the feudal ruling class cannot and is unwilling to improve politics, and it must rely more on political fantasies. The greatness of "upright officials" is a component of feudal political fantasies. They praised upright officials in order to publicize that the "law of the king" is fair, and that the feudal emperor is striving for political integrity, so as to achieve deception of the people.

    "Upright officials" have their own characteristics in China. This is the so-called "loving the people like children". This statement is both a deception and a self-exposure of the essence of upright officials. Why is it a deception? Upright officials are "loyal to the emperor", and they do have some actions that seem to sympathize with the people. There are inevitable contradictions between loyalty to the emperor and loving the people. How do upright officials unify loyalty to the emperor and loving the people? That is: "Loving the people is for the sake of loving the emperor." Loving the people is the means, loving the emperor is the purpose; loving the people is the coat, loving the emperor is the essence. This kind of "loving the people" cannot but be a deception. Why is it a self-exposure? The key lies in the meaning of "like a child." This is because the "upright official" wants to be the people's father and ride on the people's heads. In China's feudal and semi-feudal eras, there was not only the rule of the feudal system, but also the rule of the patriarchal system. Under the patriarchal system, wives and children are slaves of the patriarch, and it is a matter of course for them to be oppressed and exploited, and they cannot resist. The suppression of peasant uprisings and the massacre of the people by "upright officials" are also within the scope of "loving the people like children". The dual political and patriarchal rule is the old tradition of Chinese feudal society. The so-called "upright official" is just a loyal executor of the old tradition, which is its characteristic.

    To evaluate upright officials, we must first recognize that they are one of the tools of feudal rule and are essentially reactionary. However, if individual upright officials have really done a little good, can they be affirmed? From a Marxist-Leninist point of view, we must also treat the exploiting class differently. If upright officials are treated the same as corrupt officials, the problem cannot be solved. The difficulty is, what standard to use to distinguish between good and bad.

    In my opinion, the standard for distinction is whether it is beneficial to the social production of the time. From a Marxist-Leninist point of view, the change of class society is gradually progressing rather than regressing. Therefore, it can be said that in ancient society, the more social production develops, the closer the working people are to complete liberation; and every step society takes forward, the more opportunities the working people have to be liberated. The development of social production is of great importance. If a certain upright official has done something that is beneficial to social production, even if it is a partial benefit, this event can still be affirmed, without exaggerating, shrinking, or burying its benefits.

    There is another problem. In history, most of the beneficiaries of the advancement of production are the exploiting class, and the peasants benefit very little. Is it not possible to affirm this event if "who benefits" is used as a measure? In my opinion, this is not how to view the problem. The struggle for production itself is a revolution, which is carried out by the working people. In the struggle for production, the workers transform the world and also improve their political consciousness. In the feudal era, the advancement of social production, from another point of view, also promoted the death of the feudal system, and it cannot be said that it was not beneficial to the peasants.

    Qiu Riqing: Upright officials in history should be viewed from two perspectives. Theories that spread illusions about upright officials must be criticized, but upright officials cannot be completely equated with corrupt officials.

    We must follow the law of one divides into two when it comes to upright officials in history.

    (1) Regarding upright officials in history, we must see the side that they have in common with corrupt officials. They are both tools for exercising dictatorship over the peasant class. In this respect, or fundamentally speaking, they are "birds of a feather." But on the other hand, we must also see the side that upright officials do not completely have in common with corrupt officials. Generally speaking, upright officials more strictly maintain feudal ethics and laws, and in order to consolidate the fundamental interests of the feudal dynasty, they carried out certain activities that objectively conformed to some of the people's wishes at the time, such as redressing some unjust cases, suppressing some powerful bullies, or building some water conservancy projects, or making some improvements. Of course, we must also see the harmfulness of these upright officials' phenomena.

    It is entirely possible for the ruling class to make certain activities or measures under certain historical conditions that both represent or conform to its own long-term and fundamental interests and conform to the temporary or non-fundamental interests of the peasant class or the ruled class. Otherwise, how can contradictions be eased? This is by no means a "two combining into one" point of view. Of course, in terms of wording, it can only be said that "it both represents or conforms to its own long-term interests and conforms to the temporary interests of the peasant class," and cannot say "it both represents or conforms to its own long-term interests and represents the temporary interests of the peasant class." Upright officials in history, under certain historical conditions, can do some things in order to consolidate the rule of their own class that objectively conform to the temporary interests of the peasant class at the time. Separating these things (measures) from the perspective of long-term interests and temporary interests conforms to the dialectics of one divides into two.

    (2) Historically, feudal dynasties and feudal literati have greatly publicized and beautified the lofty image of upright officials. The masses of the people, influenced by the former, have unhealthy and backward illusions about upright officials, only seeing the side that corrupt officials are opposed to the people, and not seeing the side that upright officials are also opposed to the people, believing that no revolution is needed, no change in production relations is needed, and that having upright officials can solve the problem. These should all be thoroughly exposed and criticized today.

    (3) But while we expose and criticize upright officials, we cannot completely equate them with corrupt officials, and we should comprehensively evaluate them, both seeing the side that they have in common with corrupt officials in essence and seeing the side that they do not completely have in common with corrupt officials.

    Hao Bingheng: Removing the feudal dross of "upright officials" can be used as a reference for the socialist revolution.

    What is an upright official? Including being upright and selfless, having a sense of justice, and not being confused, the most important thing is not to be corrupt, not to reach out to the people or reach out to the people less. In this way, the exploitation of the people is reduced, which is also beneficial to the feudal dynasty. Taking Hai Rui as an example, he did a lot to reduce the people's burden, which is commendable.

    When every feudal dynasty rises, there are relatively few phenomena of corruption, and when it declines, bribery often prevails. The emergence of upright officials often happens at this time. Hai Rui's era was exactly this era. Yan Song need not be mentioned. Xu Jie, who was known as a good prime minister, also owned 400,000 mu of fertile land. When Zhang Juzheng's father died, in order to go home for mourning, he used 200 civilians to carry the sedan chair back. Needless to say, the extravagance and extortion along the way. Compared with Hai Rui, whose estate was only 150 taels of silver after his death (one said more than ten taels), which side did the people's sympathy and support lie on? Isn't this very obvious?

    We have a Marxist-Leninist scale, and the ancients also had a scale, which is feudal morality, law, and custom. It is okay to use the Marxist-Leninist scale to measure the ancients and make reasonable judgments, but to demand it of the ancients is equivalent to turning back time and forcing the ancients' cart to fit the wheels of today's people. Is it worth praising upright officials? According to Chairman Mao's instructions, "removing its feudal dross" and using it as a reference for the socialist revolution or socialist construction is okay, but there is no need to praise it.

### 上海学术界部分人士笔谈“清官”问题

    上海学术界部分人士笔谈“清官”问题
    编者按  上海《学术月刊》今年一月号，发表了《关于“清官”讨论笔谈》。下面选载的是笔谈的摘要。周谷城：“清官”贪官是一丘之貉，但又非全无区别。“清官”纵有好处，毕竟没有什么了不起。
    关于所谓清官、贪官。（一）所谓清官和贪官，既然都是统治阶级的工具，那末说他们同是一丘之貉，或没有什么区别，不会有很大的不公道。（二）不过在压迫人民、剥削人民的前提之下，说清官与贪官彼此全无区别，确与事实不符。压迫轻一点的比压迫重一点的总要好些；剥削少一点的比剥削多一点的总要好些。进一步说，清官与贪官虽同是压迫人民、剥削人民的工具，但清官如能利用政治力量，强迫人民兴修水利等事，从而发展生产，未尝于人民毫无益处。就这点说，所谓清官，只要真能做一点点儿好事，到底要比贪官好一点点儿。（三）但清官之所作所为，于人民或有暂时的些微利益；换得的却是统治阶级本身的延长或巩固，这是与人民打倒统治阶级，彻底肃清压迫与剥削的愿望完全相反的。这里起了贪官所不能起的作用。就这点说，始终为统治阶级服务的所谓清官，纵有好处，其好处毕竟没有什么了不起，甚或不能偿还其罪行。
    关于所谓“肯定”、“否定”。（一）肯定与否定云云，就目前的用法看，所指的似乎完全属于评价范围，与历史的存在与否，不是一事。历史人物或事情，其影响可能因评价而变更；但其存在，不会因作了否定的评价而变成不存在。（二）现在所谓评价，多是重行评价。如对某人过去评价太高了，否定其一部分或全部；对某人过去评价太低了，肯定其一部分或全部。时代变了，评价自然不同。不过历史人物或事情自身的存在，扩大一点说，历史自身的存在，不会因评价而变更。（三）我们研究历史，最重发现规律，最重阐明历史发展的必然趋势。趋势明白了，于评价人物要方便得多。不过，于关键性的人物之所作所为，摸得很清，于发现规律，阐明趋势，又有直接帮助。
    平  心：把清官同人民之间的界限勾销是荒谬的，但是把他们同贪吏、豪强之间的区别划去也不能服人。对清官的批判有两条标准：一是现实的政治是非；二是历史是非。
    清廉自守、立朝敢谏、兴修水利、扶植农事、整饬吏治、减免赋役以及比较关心民困的“良相”“循吏”，史不绝书。他们的“德政”“懿行”不少是经过了史家的缘饰渲染的。但是，史籍上的纪载，多少透露了清官不同于一般封建官僚的风格。把他们和同代的暴官污吏、权奸豪强看作一丘之貉，显然是不符合历史真象的。清官同封建国家的一般官吏有共同为封建统治阶级服务的一面，又有同他们相异以至彼此矛盾的一面。如果夸大了后者，把清官同人民之间的界限一笔勾销了，当然是荒谬的。但是，如果只看到前者，而忘记了后者，把他们同恶吏、豪强之间的界限一概划去了，也是不能叫人心服的。
    吴晗同志的主要错误，在于抹煞了清官同人民之间的分界线，从而把被封建地主阶级用来压迫人民的国家和王法给抽象化了；同时严重歪曲了明代农民的历史形象，取消了人民在历史上的斗争作用。这种“古为今用”的歌颂和论断，对于当前的社会主义政治不能不产生极坏的影响。
    能不能因为吴晗同志在海瑞问题上犯了错误，我们就走到另外一个极端，不分皂白地把历史上的清官一概抹黑呢？这是关系到评论历史是非的一个重要问题。
    对于历史上的所谓“循吏”“良吏”，本来应当作具体分析，分别估价，不能笼统对待。他们之中，的确有一些是被统治阶级过分美化了、徒有虚名的偶象人物。他们在历史上的破坏作用和腐蚀作用远远大于积极作用，甚至有些所谓名臣的“善政德业”，根本就是秽史伪造的。对于他们，只有贬斥的份儿。可是，在所谓清官中，确有不少是对人民作了一些有益的事，减轻了人民的一些痛苦灾害，他们的某些治绩，甚至对后世都留下了良好的影响（如发展农业生产、兴修水利、保护水土之类）。怎能因为他们忠于当时的王朝和整个统治阶级的利益，就贬得一文不值呢？如果说把清官捧上九天，是犯了右倾的错误，把他们一概打入十八重地狱，是不是犯了“左”倾的错误呢？
    对于海瑞之类的清官要不要批判呢？毫无疑问是需要的。批判的标准有两条：一条是按照现实的政治是非，另一条是按照已往的历史是非。任何一个清官，如果他在当时坚决捍卫整个剥削阶级，对人民进行麻痹镇压，阻碍了历史的发展；如果他顽强地维护那违反劳动人民利益和社会进步轨道的传统制度，这就不仅应当被看作同当时的人民大众处于敌对的地位，而且应当被视为同现代的劳动人民属于两个对抗的营垒，被视为现代剥削阶级的远祖（这里不是指血统关系的远祖，而是指阶级关系的远祖）和先行者。我们的思想感情究竟应当站在哪一方面呢？这就必然涉及现实的政治是非问题。
    可是，历史人物毕竟是过去了的古人，我们不能拿今天的无产阶级政治秤尺去衡量他们，要求他们同现在的革命政治家一样对待人民；对于他们必须依据当时的具体历史条件认真分析，分别对待。假如有人认为凡是清官，都是历史罪人，同所有的贪官污吏、权奸恶霸、民蠹国贼没有一丝一毫区别，那是把马克思主义十足庸俗化了。难道无产阶级是只管现实政治是非不顾历史是非的粗暴力量吗？不能同意这种严重曲解马克思主义阶级观的偏见。
    束世?：不同意“清官”是封建制度的自我调节器。“清官”的高大是封建统治者的政治幻想。评价“清官”的标准要看是否有利于当时的社会生产。
    所谓“清官”，只是封建社会的产品，大都出在每一王朝的中年以后。有人说，清官是封建制度在矛盾尖锐化过程中的一种自我调节器。这个论点我不能完全同意。所谓清官，指的是地方官（良吏、循吏）。个别地方官的影响只能是短暂的、局部的，对整个王朝政局不能起调节作用，更不能对“封建制度”起调节作用。
    清官的情况有些特殊，它影响虽小却有虚名，而这虚名在他死后才越来越大。这是一种“政治幻想”。拿著名的清官包拯、海瑞的历史来看就很清楚。封建制是需要利用政治幻想进行统治的。在阶级矛盾尖锐化以后，封建统治阶级不能也不愿改善政治，就更要倚靠政治幻想，“清官”的高大是封建政治幻想的一个组成部分。他们歌颂清官，无非是借以宣扬“王法”是公正的，封建皇帝是力求政治清明的，以此达到对民众的欺骗。
    “清官”在中国有它的特点。这就是所谓“爱民如子”。这话，一方面是欺骗，一方面也是对清官本质的自我暴露。为什么说是欺骗？清官是“忠君”的，又确有象是同情人民的一些举动，忠君与爱民不免有矛盾。清官是怎样把忠君和爱民统一起来的呢？那就是：“爱民所以爱君也”。爱民是手段，爱君是目的；爱民是外套，爱君是本质。这种“爱民”不能不是欺骗。何以说是自我暴露？关键就在于“如子”的含义。这就是“清官”要做人民的爸爸，要骑在人民的头上。在我国封建时代和半封建时代不仅有封建制的统治，还有宗法制的统治。在宗法制下，妻、子是家长的奴隶，他们受压迫、受剥削是理所当然的，不能反抗。“清官”之镇压农民起义，屠杀人民，也是“爱民如子”范围以内的事。政治的、宗法的双重统治，是中国封建社会的旧传统，所谓“清官”，不过是旧传统的忠实执行者，这是它的特点。
    评价清官必须首先认清它是封建统治工具之一，本质上是反动的。但个别清官如果真正做了一点好事，能否加以肯定？从马克思列宁主义讲来，我们对于剥削阶级也要分别对待。如果说清官与贪官一视同仁，总不能解决问题。困难的是，用什么标准来区分好坏。
    在我看，区分的标准为是否有利于当时的社会生产。从马克思列宁主义看来，阶级社会的更迭是逐渐进步而不是退步。因此可以说，在古代社会中，社会生产愈发展，则劳动人民愈接近彻底解放；而社会每前进一步，劳动人民获得解放的机会也就多一些。社会生产的发展，关系是巨大的。某一清官如曾做了一些有利于社会生产的事，尽管是局部的利益，仍可对这一件事加以肯定，不夸大、不缩小，不埋没他的好处。
    还有一个问题，历史上生产的推进，受益的人多半是剥削阶级，农民受益很小。拿“对谁有利”来衡量，是不是对这件事也不能加以肯定？在我看，不能这样看问题。生产斗争的本身就是一种革命，是由劳动人民进行的。在生产斗争中，劳动者改造了世界，也提高了自己的政治觉悟。在封建时代，社会生产的推进，从另一方面看，也同时促进了封建制的死亡，不能说对农民无益。
    丘日庆：对历史上的清官要一分为二。散播对清官幻想的论调必须批判，但是不能把清官与贪官完全等同起来。
    我们对于历史上的清官，必须依据一分为二的规律。
    （一）对于历史上的清官，要看到它同贪官相同的一面。它们同是对农民阶级专政的工具。在这一点上说，或从根本上说，它们是“一丘之貉”。但在另一方面，我们又要看到清官同贪官不完全相同的一面。一般说来，清官比较严格维护封建纲常和法，为了巩固封建皇朝根本利益，作了某些活动，在客观上符合人民当时的某些愿望，例如平抑一些冤狱，裁抑一些强豪，或兴修一些水利，或作出一些改良。当然，我们对于这些清官的现象，又要看到它的危害性。
    统治阶级在一定的历史条件下，作出某些活动或措施，既代表或符合它本身的长期的、根本的利益，又符合农民阶级或被统治阶级的暂时的或非根本的利益是完全可能的。否则，矛盾何从缓和？这绝不是“合二而一”的观点。当然在用语上，这只能说“既代表或符合它本身的长期利益，又符合农民阶级的暂时利益”，而不能说“既代表或符合它本身的长期利益，又代表农民阶级的暂时利益”。历史上的清官，在一定的历史条件下，为了巩固本阶级的统治，是可以作出一些事情在客观上符合于农民阶级当时的短暂的利益的。把这些事情（措施）从长远的利益和暂时利益分别来看，是符合一分为二的辩证法的。
      （二）历史上封建皇朝和封建文人大肆宣传、美化清官的高大形象，人民群众因受到前者的影响而对清官产生不健康的、落后幻想，只看到贪官同人民对立的一面，没有看到清官也同人民对立的一面，认为不要革命，不要改变生产关系，有了清官就能解决问题。这些今天都应该受到彻底的揭露和批判。
      （三）但我们在揭露和批判清官的同时，又不能将它同贪官完全等同起来，应该全面地评价，既要看到在本质上它同贪官相同的一面，又要看到它同贪官不完全相同的一面。
    郝昺衡：剔除“清官”的封建性糟粕，可以作为社会主义革命的借鉴。
    什么是清官？包括刚正无私、有正义感、不糊涂，最主要的还在于不贪污，不向人民伸手或少向人民伸手。这样，就减轻了对人民的剥削，也对封建王朝有利。拿海瑞说，就作过不少减轻人民负担的事，这是难能可贵的。
    每一个封建王朝上升的时候，贪污的现象比较少，一到了它走下坡路的时候，往往贿赂公行。清官的出现，常常在这个时候。海瑞的时代，正是这个时代。严嵩不必说了，号称好宰相的徐阶也拥有四十万亩良田，张居正死了父亲，为了奔丧，用二百民伕抬着轿子把他抬了回去，沿途的铺张勒索，那还用说吗？比起海瑞来，死后清点遗产只有一百五十两银子（一说十多两），人民的同情和拥护，到底在哪一方，这不是很明显的吗？
    我们有一把马克思列宁主义的尺，古人也有一把尺，那就是封建道德、法律和习惯。拿马克思列宁主义的尺去衡量古人作出合理的判断，是可以的，若以之要求古人，那就等于年光倒流，强古人之车合今人之辙了。清官值得值不得歌颂呢？按照毛主席的指示，“剔除其封建性的糟粕”，作为社会主义革命或社会主义建设的借鉴是可以的，歌颂就不必了。
