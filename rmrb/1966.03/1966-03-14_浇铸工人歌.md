    Song of the Foundry Workers
    Worker of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Jiang Yude
    Walking into the boiling workshop,
    Rays of red light everywhere, flashes of lightning,
    The smelting furnace churns up a red storm,
    The tapping spout spews out raging flames.
    Whirr—fire clouds fill the sky,
    People never know fatigue—
    Listen! There is still the sound of shackles in the world,
    Look! Half the Earth is still dark.
    All oppressed brothers,
    Quickly throw your chains into the furnace to melt!
    The red storm sweeps across the five continents and four seas,
    The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are fighting for freedom!
    How Chairman Mao says, that’s how we’ll do!
    With the world revolution in our hearts,
    The workshop is the front line for killing the enemy.
    Foundry workers fear no difficulty,
    The four volumes of treasured books point the way,
    We raise the red-hot large steel ladle,
    To pave the road of revolution smoother and smoother.

    浇铸工人歌
    武汉钢铁公司工人  蒋育德走进沸腾的车间，道道红光，刷刷闪电，化铁炉卷起红色的风暴，出铁口喷出熊熊的火焰。哗——满天火云飞，人们永不知疲倦——听！世界上还有镣铐的响声，看！地球上还黑着半边天。一切受压迫的兄弟呵，快把锁链投进炉里熔炼！红色的风暴席卷五洲四海，亚非拉人民在为争取自由而
  战！毛主席怎样说，咱们就怎样干！心里有世界革命的风云，车间就是杀敌的前线。浇铸工人不畏难，四卷宝书把方向指点，咱们举起通红的大钢勺，把革命的路越铺越平坦。
