    Stars in Motion
    Zhou Fen
    In nature, there is no absolute stillness; everything is in motion. The "constant" in "constant star" (恒星) is not entirely accurate. In 1718, when British astronomer Halley compared the positions he had measured of four bright stars, Sirius, Arcturus, etc., with those measured by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD, he discovered that the positions of these four stars on the celestial sphere did indeed change, and that this change could not be explained by phenomena such as precession and nutation.
    The phenomenon discovered by Halley is called proper motion, which is the projection on the celestial sphere of the distance a star travels in space in one year. Using photographic methods, the proper motions of more than 200,000 stars have now been measured. Generally speaking, stars closer to us have larger proper motions, and those farther away have smaller proper motions. The largest known proper motion is that of "Barnard's Star," discovered by Barnard. It moves ten and one-quarter seconds per year, taking about 370 years to move one degree. The average proper motion of stars visible to the naked eye is only one-tenth of a second, so the shapes of constellations do not show any significant changes over thousands of years. Over a longer period of time, differences will gradually become apparent. The Big Dipper will look very different in 200,000 years from now, unrecognizable even.
    In addition to proper motion, stars also have a motion towards or away from us, called radial motion. The radial velocity of a star can be calculated from the spectral line shift of the star's spectrum. Currently, the radial velocities of about 16,000 stars have been measured, most of which are a few kilometers or tens of kilometers per second, but some are as fast as 500 kilometers per second.
    If the distance, proper motion, and radial velocity of a star are determined, it is easy to calculate its velocity in space relative to the sun, also called spatial velocity. Research shows that the smaller the mass of a star, the greater its spatial velocity, with the fastest possibly exceeding 800 kilometers per second!
    The sun is a star, and of course, it is also in motion. The sun and all the celestial bodies in the solar system are moving towards a point near Vega at a speed of 20 kilometers per second. This point is called the apex, and the distance traveled each year is about 600 million kilometers.
    After subtracting the sun's velocity from the spatial velocity of a star, we obtain the star's true motion, called peculiar motion. The peculiar motion of stars is also regular: stars moving along the galactic plane are more numerous, and those moving perpendicular to the galactic plane are fewer. This is similar to pedestrians on a road: there are more people walking along the street, and they are faster; fewer people cross the street, and they are slower.
    Stars not only move in space but also rotate on their axes. Generally speaking, yellow stars rotate more slowly; for example, the rotational speed of the sun's equator is only 2 kilometers per second. Blue or white stars rotate faster; the fastest ones have equatorial speeds of up to 300 kilometers per second!
    "All that is so-called eternal is being inevitably transformed into an endless cycle of arising and passing away." This famous saying by Engels in *Dialectics of Nature* is convincingly proven in the study of stars.

    恒星在运动中
    周芬
    在自然界里没有绝对的静止，一切都在运动着。恒星的这个“恒”字并不完全确切。一七一八年英国天文学家哈雷把他所测定的天狼、大角等四颗亮星的位置和公元二世纪希腊天文学家托勒密所测定的相比时，发现了这四颗星在天球上的位置确有变化，而这变化不能用岁差、章动等现象来解释。
    哈雷所发现的这种现象叫做自行，它是一年中恒星在空间里所走过的距离在天球上的投影。用照相方法，现在已经测出二十多万颗恒星的自行。一般说来，离我们近的恒星自行大，远的自行小。已知自行最大的是巴拿德所发现的“飞星”，它每年移动十又四分之一秒，大约要三百七十多年才能移动一度。肉眼看得见的星，自行的平均值只有十分之一秒，所以星座的形状几千年来看不出有什么显著的变化。时间更长一点，就可以渐渐看出不同来了。二十万年以后的北斗七星和现在将要差得很多，认都认不出来了。
    除了自行以外，恒星还有一种向我们走近或离开我们的运动，叫做视线运动。从恒星光谱的谱线位移可以算出恒星的视线速度。目前已经测出约一万六千颗星的视线速度，其中绝大多数是每秒几公里或几十公里，但也有快到每秒五百公里的。
    如果测定了恒星的距离、自行和视线速度，便很容易算出它们在空间里对于太阳而言的运动速度，也叫做空间速度。研究的结果是：质量越小的星，空间速度越大，最快的可能超过每秒八百公里！
    太阳是一颗恒星，当然也在运动。太阳和太阳系里所有的天体都在以每秒二十公里的速度向织女星附近的一点前进，这一点叫做奔赴点，每年前进的距离约等于六亿公里。
    把太阳的运动速度从恒星的空间速度里扣除掉以后，就得到恒星的真正运动情况，叫做本动。恒星的本动也是有规律的：沿银河平面运动的恒星多，垂直于银河平面运动的少。这和马路上的行人一样：顺着大街走的多，速度也比较快；横穿马路的少，速度也小。
    恒星不但在空间里运动，同时也在自转。一般地说，黄颜色的星转得比较慢，例如，太阳赤道上的转动速度只有每秒二公里；蓝色星或白色星自转较快；转动最快的，赤道速度可达每秒三百公里！
      “一切所谓永恒的都是可变的，动的物质之永远的周转才是最后的结论。”恩格斯在《自然辩证法》里说的这句名言，在恒星的研究中，得到了令人信服的证明。
