    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    To study Marxism, one should not only learn from books, but mainly learn through class struggle, practical work, and contact with workers and peasants in order to truly learn.
                    《在中國共產黨全國宣傳工作會議上的講話》 (Talk at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China)
    If there is a correct theory, but it is only talked about for a while, shelved, and not put into practice, then even the best theory is meaningless.
                   《实践论》 (On Practice)

    毛主席语录
    学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。
                    《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》
    如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。
