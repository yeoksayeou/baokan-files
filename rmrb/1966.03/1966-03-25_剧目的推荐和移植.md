    Recommendation and Transplantation of Repertories
    Wang Wei
    Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Central-South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recommended one hundred revolutionary modern drama repertories to the entire region. A good recommendation!
    In the past two years, various regions and opera genres across the country have created and performed many revolutionary modern dramas, occupying the socialist stage of drama. Many excellent repertories have been transplanted to many opera genres for performance. The Propaganda Department of the Central-South Bureau selected and recommended excellent repertories emerging from last year's regional performances and other regions. This has greatly promoted the widespread dissemination of excellent repertories. This not only reflects the flourishing scene of revolutionary modern drama, but also meets the requirements of the broad masses and various theatrical troupes, especially grassroots troupes.
    Of course, various opera genres and theatrical troupes can also organize their own manpower to create new repertories. However, some troupes, due to limitations in manpower and other conditions, find it difficult to meet performance requirements by relying solely on their own creations. Therefore, one way to meet performance needs is to "transplant" repertories.
    Although most of the one hundred repertories recommended by the Propaganda Department of the Central-South Bureau are works welcomed by the masses, they are not perfect. Some repertories lack ideological depth, some are not artistically complete enough, and some language needs further processing and refinement. Therefore, the work of transplantation cannot simply be copied verbatim, but is a creative labor that needs to be improved, enriched, and made more perfect.
    Recommending good repertories should be a regular task. It is hoped that relevant literary and art leading departments in various places will pay attention to this work.

    剧目的推荐和移植
    王为
    最近，中共中央中南局宣传部向全区推荐了一百个革命现代戏剧目。推荐得好！
    近两年来，全国各地区、各剧种都创作并演出了许多革命现代戏，占领了社会主义的戏剧舞台。许多优秀剧目被移植到很多剧种演出。中南局宣传部根据去年全区汇演和其它地区涌现的优秀剧目，加以挑选、推荐，这就大大促进了优秀剧目的广泛流传。既反映了革命现代戏蓬勃发展的景象，又满足了广大群众以及各个剧团特别是基层剧团的要求。
    当然，各个剧种、各个剧团自己也可以组织人力创作新剧目，但是，有的剧团由于人力等条件的限制，仅仅依靠自己创作是难以满足演出要求的，因此，满足演出的办法之一就是“移植”剧目。
    中南局宣传部所推荐的一百个剧目，虽然大多是群众所欢迎的作品，但并不是完美无缺的，有的剧目思想深度不够，有的艺术上还不够完整，有的语言还需要加工提炼。因此，移植的工作，就不能简单地原样照搬，而是一种创作性的劳动，需要提高它，丰富它，使之更加完善。
    推荐好剧目应该是一件经常性的工作，希望各地有关文艺领导部门都来重视这项工作。
