    From "Three No-Brings" to "Three Brings"
    Shao Dianjun
    Before this Socialist Education Movement, when postmen in Huai'an County, Hebei Province, went to the countryside, they only delivered letters and did not bring stamps; they only handed over remittance slips and did not bring remittances; they only delivered notifications and did not bring packages. This was the business procedure stipulated by the postal and telecommunications departments. After the Socialist Education Movement, they changed this system, bringing stamps, remittances, and packages when delivering to the countryside.
    The change from three no-brings to three brings is indeed a great change. What exactly do the "three brings" bring? The practice of the past six months has answered: it has facilitated customers, benefited production, and been welcomed by the masses. They no longer have to run to the county seat just to buy stamps or collect remittances and packages, saving countless labor. The masses see the "three brings" as "practical actions to support agriculture" and call the postmen "red communications soldiers."
    Originally, buying stamps, sending parcels, and picking up items at the post office counter had a long history; the superiors had regulations, and the masses had "habits." However, it was impacted and eliminated in the Socialist Education Movement of a county bureau. What force was it due to? It is the class feeling nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. By studying Chairman Mao's works, highlighting politics, and changing their state of mind, they felt that without reform, there would be no convenience for the peasant brothers, and the function of the postal and telecommunications departments to serve the masses would not be further enhanced.
    Reforming the old and inappropriate business systems is a revolutionary act. "Three Brings" is precisely the result of daring to revolutionize. Those who dare to revolutionize will proceed from the production and life of the masses, dare to break free from the shackles of old things, and never stubbornly stick to the old frameworks. The Huai'an Post and Telecommunications Bureau has this spirit of daring to revolutionize.

    从“三不带”到“三带”
    邵佃俊
    在这次社会主义教育运动以前，河北省怀安县邮递员下乡时，光管送信，不带邮票；光交汇单，不带汇款；光送通知单，不带包裹。这是邮电部门规定的业务手续制度。经过社会主义教育运动，他们变革了这个制度，下乡投递时带上了邮票、汇款、包裹。
    由三个不带变成了三个带，确实是很大的变化。“三个带”究竟带来什么？半年来的实践作了回答：方便了顾客，有利于生产，受到群众欢迎。他们不再单单为了购买邮票或者拿汇款、包裹到县城跑路了，节省了无数的劳力。群众把“三个带”看成是“支援农业的实际行动”，称投递员为“红色通信兵”。
    本来，到邮局的柜台上买邮票，寄包裹，取物件，有很长的历史；上级有规定，群众有“习惯”。而在一个县局的社会主义教育运动中，就冲击了它、革掉了它。是由于什么力量呢？是毛泽东思想哺育起来的阶级感情。他们学习毛主席著作，突出政治，精神状态变了，觉得不进行变革，就没有方便农民兄弟，就没有进一步发挥邮电部门为群众服务的职能。
    变革旧的不适当的业务制度，是一种革命的行动。“三带”，正是敢于革命的结果。敢于革命的人，就会从有利于群众的生产和生活出发，敢于摆脱旧事物的束缚，绝不死守旧框框不放。怀安邮电局，就具有这种敢于革命的精神。
