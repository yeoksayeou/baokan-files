	Brief Comments
	A Defeated General Boasts
	Former U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Taylor, clamored to "break the myth of the invincible liberation war." He certainly speaks with a big tone.
	However, the "invincibility of the liberation war" is not a myth, but an irrefutable truth. Isn't it precisely because Taylor exhausted all his efforts to break this truth without success that he broke his own rice bowl? Now that this defeated general of the South Vietnamese people has stepped down, yet shouts about "breaking the myth of the invincible liberation war," this kind of bragging seems particularly ridiculous.
	Transfer is Sufficient
	According to a New Delhi report, as a result of the talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia has agreed to provide India with loans of 60 million to 80 million US dollars within five years.
	Everyone knows that Yugoslavia, like India, relies on American "aid" and loans to survive. Not long ago, Yugoslavia had just begged the United States for 80 million US dollars in "aid." It seems that the loans it wants to give to India can simply be transferred in Washington.

    三言两语
    败将吹牛
    美国前任南越“大使”泰勒叫嚷要“打破解放战争无往不胜的神话。”口气着实不小。
    但是，“解放战争无往不胜”，并不是什么神话，而是颠扑不破的真理。泰勒不正是因为费尽了力气想要打破这个真理未成，而打破了自己的饭碗的吗？现在，这个南越人民的手下败将下了台，却高喊什么要“打破解放战争无往不胜的神话”，这种牛皮就特别显得可笑。
    转账即可
    据新德里消息，印南两国总理会谈结果，南斯拉夫答应在五年内向印度提供六千万到八千万美元的贷款。
    谁都知道，南斯拉夫也和印度一样，都是靠美国的“援助”和贷款过活的。不久以前，南斯拉夫才刚向美国乞求到了八千万美元的“援助”。看来，它要给予印度的贷款，在华盛顿转一下账就可以了。
