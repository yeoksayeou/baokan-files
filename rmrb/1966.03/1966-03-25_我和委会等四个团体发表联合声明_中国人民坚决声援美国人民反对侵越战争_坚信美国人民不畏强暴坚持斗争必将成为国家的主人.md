    I and the Peace Committee and other four groups issued a joint statement
    The Chinese people resolutely support the American people's opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam
    Confident that the American people, unafraid of violence and persistent in struggle, will become masters of the country
    Xinhua News Agency, 24th – The China Peace Committee and other four people's organizations today reiterated in a joint statement: The Chinese people express deep sympathy and support for the American people's mass movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam and against oppression and exploitation. The statement said that the Chinese people and the people of the world will always stand with the great American people and are confident that the American people will become the masters of their own country and achieve final victory in the struggle against the war of aggression and for true democracy, freedom, and peace.
      The China Peace Committee, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation today issued a joint statement in support of the American people's movement against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The statement said: The American people's movement against the Johnson administration's war of aggression against Vietnam is rising one after another, surging forward. The "National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam" in the United States called for the "International Protest Day Against U.S. Intervention in Vietnam" to be held from March 25th to 26th, setting off another climax and receiving widespread international response. The Chinese people resolutely support this just struggle of the American people.
    The statement pointed out that large numbers of American students, youths, women, intellectuals, religious figures, black masses, and an increasing number of workers, regardless of the persecution and threats from the American military and police, have marched and gathered, taking various forms to launch struggles. They put forward resounding slogans: "Stop Johnson's bloody war!" "U.S. troops get out of Vietnam!" This unprecedentedly widespread anti-war movement of the American people, echoing and combining with the struggle against the persecution of black people, the strangulation of democratic freedoms, and the oppression of working people, has made the American ruling clique feel very frightened and uneasy.
    The statement strongly condemned the U.S. government for intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam, despite the strong protests and opposition from the American people and the people of the world, and also deliberately attempting to extend the flames of war to the entire Indochina, directing its main spearhead against China. The statement pointed out that the "peace talks" conspiracy played by the American reactionaries is only to cover up its actions to strengthen the war and to deceive and paralyze the American people and the people of the world. The statement said that it is very clear that in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is the aggressor and the culprit for destroying the 1954 Geneva Accords. The U.S. government must immediately stop its aggression against the whole of Vietnam, must withdraw all its invading troops from South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems. Otherwise, peace cannot be restored on Vietnamese soil. The Vietnamese people have solemnly declared that they will never yield to the threat of U.S. imperialism at any time, and they will fight to the end against U.S. imperialist aggression.
    The statement said that the Chinese people are linked to the fraternal Vietnamese people by flesh and blood. We steadfastly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until their struggle achieves final victory. We are ready, if the U.S. aggressors dare to impose war on our heads, we will fight together with the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries in the world, including the American people, to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.
    The statement said: The U.S. imperialists' launching of the war of aggression against Vietnam has also brought endless disasters to the American people themselves. Ordinary American citizens are forced to bear the heavy burden of military spending, shedding blood and sacrificing their lives for the Wall Street bosses to make war fortunes. The expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam will inevitably accelerate the fascistization of the United States domestically, pushing the people into an abyss of suffering. The interests of the American people and the Vietnamese people are consistent, and U.S. imperialism is their common enemy. The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression has powerfully supported the struggle of the American people. The American people's anti-war movement is also a great support to the Vietnamese people. In the common struggle of the whole world against U.S. aggression, oppression, interference, and subversion, the American people's movement against the aggressive policies and war policies of their own imperialist government has a special significance and is increasingly becoming an important component of the international united front against U.S. imperialism.
    The statement finally said: The Chinese people express deep sympathy and support for the American people's mass movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam and against oppression and exploitation. We have always believed that the U.S. imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, are our enemies, and the peace-loving American people are our friends. In the United States, the real force is not the reactionaries, but the people. The power of the reactionaries is superficial, temporary, and decadent. The newborn power of the people is invincible. We are confident that more than 90% of the American people will increasingly awaken and join the ranks of opposing the war of aggression and striving for true democracy, freedom, and peace. They will unite more closely, fear no violence, persevere in the struggle, until they achieve final victory. The American people will become the masters of their own country. The Chinese people and the people of the world will always stand with the great American people.

    我和委会等四个团体发表联合声明
    中国人民坚决声援美国人民反对侵越战争
    坚信美国人民不畏强暴坚持斗争必将成为国家的主人
    新华社二十四日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等四个人民团体今天在一项联合声明中重申：中国人民对美国人民反对侵越战争、反对压迫剥削的群众运动表示深切的同情和声援。声明说，中国人民和全世界人民将永远站在伟大的美国人民一边，并且坚信美国人民一定会成为自己国家的主人，在反对侵略战争，争取真正的民主、自由与和平的斗争中取得最后的胜利。
      中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会四个人民团体，今天就支持美国人民反对美帝国主义侵略越南战争的运动发表了联合声明。
    声明说：美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵略越南战争的运动，此起彼伏，一浪推一浪，汹涌前进。美国“结束越南战争全国协调委员会”号召于三月二十五日至二十六日举行的“反对美国干涉越南国际抗议日”，掀起了另一个高潮，并且得到国际上广泛的响应。中国人民坚决支持美国人民的这种正义斗争。
    声明指出，美国广大学生、青年、妇女、知识分子、宗教人士、黑人群众和越来越多的工人，不顾美国军警的迫害和威胁，纷纷游行集会，采取了多种多样的形式展开斗争。他们提出了响亮的口号：“停止约翰逊的血腥战争！”“美军撤出越南！”美国人民这一空前广泛的反战运动，同反对迫害黑人、绞杀民主自由、压榨劳动人民的斗争相呼应，相结合，使美国统治集团感到十分恐慌和不安。
    声明强烈谴责美国政府不顾美国人民和世界人民的强烈抗议和反对，仍在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，还蓄意要把战火烧到整个印度支那，把主要矛头针对中国。声明指出，美国反动派玩弄的“和谈”阴谋，只不过是为了掩盖它强化战争的行动，欺骗和麻痹美国人民和世界人民。声明说，事情十分清楚，在越南，美帝国主义是侵略者，是破坏一九五四年日内瓦协议的祸首。美国政府必须立即停止对整个越南的侵略，必须从越南南方撤走全部侵略军，让越南人民解决自己的问题。否则，越南土地上就不可能恢复和平。越南人民已经庄严宣告，在任何时候决不向美帝国主义的威胁屈服，他们将为反对美帝国主义侵略战斗到底。
    声明说，中国人民同兄弟的越南人民是血肉相联的。我们坚定不移地支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，直到他们的斗争取得最后的胜利。我们已经准备好了，如果美国侵略者胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们将同越南人民和包括美国人民在内的全世界各国人民一起，为彻底打败美帝国主义而奋斗。
    声明说：美帝国主义者发动侵越战争，也给美国本国人民带来无穷的灾难。普通的美国公民被迫承担军费的重荷，为华尔街老板发战争财去流血送命。侵越战争的扩大化，势必加速美国国内的法西斯化，把人民推进痛苦的深渊。美国人民同越南人民的利益是一致的，美帝国主义是他们的共同敌人。越南人民反对美帝侵略的斗争，有力地支援了美国人民的斗争。美国人民的反战运动，也是对越南人民的很大支援。在全世界反对美国侵略、压迫、干涉、颠覆的共同斗争中，美国人民反对本国帝国主义政府的侵略政策和战争政策的运动，具有特殊的意义，越来越成为反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线的重要组成部分。
    声明最后说：中国人民对美国反对侵越战争、反对压迫剥削的群众运动，表示深切的同情和声援。我们一向认为，侵略成性的美帝国主义是我们的敌人，爱好和平的美国人民是我们的朋友。在美国，真正有力量的不是反动派，而是人民。反动派的力量是表面的、暂时的、腐朽的。而新生的人民的力量是不可战胜的。我们坚信，百分之九十以上的美国人民将日益觉醒起来，参加到反对侵略战争，争取真正的民主、自由与和平的行列中来。他们将更紧密地团结起来，不畏强暴，坚持斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。美国人民一定会成为自己国家的主人。中国人民和全世界人民将永远站在伟大的美国人民一边。
