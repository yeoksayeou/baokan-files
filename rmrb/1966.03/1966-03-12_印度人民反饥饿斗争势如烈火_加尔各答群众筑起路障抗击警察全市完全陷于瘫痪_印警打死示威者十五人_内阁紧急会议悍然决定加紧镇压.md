    Xinhua News Agency, March 11th dispatch from Calcutta: The continuous anti-hunger struggle of the people in Calcutta, India's largest city, and its suburbs, which has lasted for twenty-three days, is further expanding. From the 10th to the morning of the 11th, demonstration processions of people in the city and nearby suburbs followed one after another. In some places, the number of demonstrators reached more than 10,000.
    According to Western news agencies, in Calcutta, demonstrators built barricades on major streets to resist police suppression. The police opened fire and threw tear gas at the demonstrators, who retaliated with stones. Fifteen demonstrators were killed. According to the Press Trust of India, when the police were frantically arresting demonstrators in Calcutta, angry crowds burned two police vans used to capture people.
    Calcutta was paralyzed on the 11th. Shops, factories, and schools were closed. Many areas of the city were without electricity, and telephone lines were also cut in some places. International and some domestic flights to and from Calcutta were suspended on the 11th.
    According to Indian newspapers on the 11th, in Singur Bagan, north of Calcutta, five hundred demonstrators valiantly resisted the brutal suppression of the police and government troops. In Rishra, more than five thousand demonstrators engaged in fierce combat with the police. At the Sindh Motor Factory, two thousand workers held a demonstration. In addition, large numbers of people held demonstrations at Khurda Road Railway Station, Falakata, and Alipurduar, protesting the Indian government's food policy. The police and army barbarously opened fire, threw tear gas, and beat demonstrators with batons, but the demonstrators persisted in their struggle. *The Statesman*, in its report, admitted that the mass demonstration movement had undergone "new developments."
    According to *The Indian Express* on the 11th, the Indian cabinet convened an emergency meeting on the 10th to discuss the situation in Calcutta, stating that it would "take all possible measures" to suppress the demonstrating masses.
