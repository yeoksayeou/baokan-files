    To Win National Liberation, Revolutionary Violence Must Be Used to Repulse Counter-Revolutionary Violence
    The Flames of the Peruvian People's Armed Struggle Are Spreading and Expanding
    Urban People's Struggle Against Plunder, Persecution, and Defense of Their Own Interests Rises Wave Upon Wave
    Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Lima Dispatch: The Peruvian people's struggle against the oppression and rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and for national liberation, is developing. The people's armed struggle has seen new developments in the Andes Mountains for more than eight months, and the people of all strata in the cities are constantly launching wave after wave of struggle against plunder, persecution, and defense of their own interests.
    The Peruvian patriotic armed struggle launched since June of last year is a sign that the Peruvian people's revolutionary movement has entered a higher stage. U.S. imperialism has tried to extinguish this spark, which is bound to start a prairie fire, from the very beginning. It has instigated the Peruvian authorities to establish a joint command of the army, navy, air force, and police, with U.S. "advisors" directing a large number of troops to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas. The reactionary government also announced martial law and promulgated a "death penalty law" to persecute revolutionaries. However, the result of violent suppression is only to make more people understand that revolutionary violence must be used to counter counter-revolutionary violence. Now, more and more patriots are embarking on the road of armed struggle. Among the twenty-four provinces in the country, the scope of guerrilla activities has expanded to nine provinces. In addition to the "Pachacutec" and "Tupac Amaru" fronts, which launched the armed struggle first, the "Cesar Vallejo" and "Javier Heraud" fronts have been established in Piura province in the north and Ayacucho province in the center. Even the British bourgeois newspaper *The Observer* admitted in an article published on January 16 that "guerrilla activity in (Peru's) remote areas is spreading, not declining."
    In the frequent battles of the past eight months, the guerrillas have occupied the U.S. copper company's mining area in the Andamarca region, attacked police outposts in Junín province, successfully ambushed and severely damaged government troops many times in the provinces of Junín, Huancavelica, and Cusco, and attacked large estates.
    The Peruvian People's Guerrillas have received strong support from the peasants. Indigenous peasants once used bows and arrows to assist the guerrillas in annihilating a police patrol. It is reported that many college students are taking Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on people's war to the mountains to mobilize peasants to carry out struggles. Many peasants, unwilling to continue to suffer the oppression and persecution of the reactionaries, have joined the guerrillas.
    Another front for the Peruvian people to combat U.S. imperialism and reactionary rule is the continuous struggle launched by the broad masses of urban working people against plunder and for the defense of their right to survival.
    At the beginning of last year, the Peruvian people first launched a fierce struggle against the U.S. plunder of Peruvian oil resources and demanded the nationalization of oil. People in the capital Lima, Cusco, and Puno provinces continuously held rallies and demonstrations, forcing the Peruvian Congress not to rashly approve a new contract signed by the authorities with the U.S.-funded International Petroleum Company. Peruvian workers in U.S. enterprises also frequently launched strikes against the plunder and control of U.S. monopoly capital, and demanded that U.S.-controlled public utilities be nationalized. For more than a year, workers in various industries, such as fishery workers, electricity workers, teachers, medical personnel, and civil servants, have continuously launched struggles against rising prices and for the right to live. At the beginning of last year, 30,000 fishermen across Peru went on strike, and their 700 representatives held demonstrations in Lima for ten consecutive days, regardless of the encirclement of the police and cavalry, demanding guarantees for their welfare. 50,000 teachers insisted on striking for more than 20 days to demand higher pay. In early April last year, workers, students, and citizens in Lima held a march and demonstration against raising urban transportation fees, and clashed fiercely with the police who suppressed them, which greatly alarmed the ruling authorities.
    The reactionary ruling authorities tried to suppress the development of the people's movement. In addition to declaring martial law, they also established a so-called "Special Investigation Committee" in August last year to carry out espionage sabotage against the people's movement in the name of "anti-communist subversion." However, the Peruvian workers who stood at the forefront of the struggle still carried out a heroic struggle. (Attached picture)

### 争取民族解放必须以革命暴力反击反革命暴力  秘鲁人民武装斗争烽火不断蔓延扩大

    争取民族解放必须以革命暴力反击反革命暴力
    秘鲁人民武装斗争烽火不断蔓延扩大
    城市人民反掠夺反迫害和捍卫切身权益斗争一浪接一浪
    新华社八日讯  利马消息：秘鲁人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的压迫、统治和争取民族解放的斗争正在发展。人民武装斗争八个多月以来在安第斯山脉有了新的开展，城市各阶层人民为反对掠夺、反对迫害和捍卫切身权益，也在不断掀起一个又一个的斗争浪潮。
    从去年六月发动的秘鲁爱国武装斗争是秘鲁人民革命运动进入更高阶段的一个标志。美帝国主义曾经力图从一开始就扑灭这一势必燎原的火种，它指使秘鲁当局建立陆军、海军、空军和警察部队的联合指挥部，由美国“顾问”指挥大批军队“围剿”游击队。反动政府还宣布戒严令，颁布了迫害革命者的“死刑法”。但是，暴力镇压的结果只是使更多的人懂得了必须用革命的暴力来反击反革命的暴力，现在，越来越多的爱国人士走上了武装斗争的道路。在全国二十四个省份中，游击队的活动范围已经扩大到九个省。除了最先发动武装斗争的“帕查库特克”和“图帕克·阿马鲁”两条战线外，在北部的皮乌拉省和中部的阿亚库乔省又成立了“塞萨尔·巴列霍”和“哈维尔·埃劳德”这两条新的游击战线。连英国资产阶级报纸《观察家报》一月十六日发表的一篇文章也承认，“（秘鲁）偏僻地区的游击活动在蔓延，而不是在衰落”。
    在过去八个月的频繁的战斗中，游击队员们曾经攻占了在安达马尔卡地区的美国铜公司的矿区，袭击了胡宁省的警察哨所，在胡宁、乌安卡维利卡、库斯科省多次成功地伏击、重创了政府军，并且袭击了大庄园。
    秘鲁人民游击队得到了农民有力的支持。印第安农民曾经用弓箭协助游击队消灭了一支警察巡逻队。据报道，不少大学生带着毛泽东主席关于人民战争的思想上山发动农民进行斗争。不少农民由于不甘继续遭受反动派的压迫和残害，纷纷参加了游击队。
    秘鲁人民打击美帝国主义和反动统治的另一条战线，是广大的城市劳动人民不断展开的反对掠夺、维护生存权利的斗争。
    去年年初，秘鲁人民首先展开了反对美国掠夺秘鲁石油资源、要求石油国有化的激烈斗争。首都利马、库斯科和普诺省的人民不断举行集会和示威，迫使秘鲁议会不敢贸然批准当局同美资国际石油公司签订的一项新合同。美国企业的秘鲁工人也频频展开反对美国垄断资本掠夺和控制的罢工斗争，并且要求把美国公司控制的公用事业收归国有。一年多以来，渔业工人、电力工人、教师、医务人员、公务人员等各个行业的工人连续展开了反对物价上涨、争取生活权利的斗争。去年年初，秘鲁全国三万渔民举行罢工，他们的七百名代表，在利马不顾警察和马队的包围，连续十天举行示威，要求保障他们的福利。五万名教师为要求提高待遇，坚持罢工二十多天。去年四月初，利马工人、学生和市民举行反对提高城市交通费的游行示威，同镇压他们的警察发生激烈冲突，使统治当局十分惊慌。
    反动统治当局力图压制人民运动的发展，除了宣布戒严令，还从去年八月开始成立了一个所谓“特别调查委员会”，以“反共产主义颠覆”为名对人民运动进行特务破坏，但是站在斗争最前列的秘鲁工人依然进行了英勇的斗争。（附图片）
