    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 23rd. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently held a meeting in Anshan to discuss how to highlight politics in rural areas and arm rural cadres and masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting called on Party committees at all levels in the region to allow Mao Zedong Thought to take root among rural cadres and masses through the Socialist Education Movement.

    Participants in the meeting included Song Renqiong, First Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary, Yu Ping, Alternate Secretary, Li Huang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, and comrades from the municipal Party committees of Anshan, Yingkou, and Lüda, as well as some county Party committees, people's commune Party committees, production brigades, and production teams.

    The meeting held that since the launch of the Socialist Education Movement, especially since the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee proposed in January this year that Mao Zedong Thought should take deep root among the masses through the Socialist Education Movement, a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively has formed among the vast cadres and masses in the Northeast region. Studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the actions of tens of thousands of people. The atmosphere of caring for the collective, selflessness, unity, and mutual assistance has been greatly promoted, and good people and good deeds have emerged continuously. Some of the masses said: After studying Chairman Mao's books, our hearts are red, our eyes are bright, and our bones are strong. After listening to Chairman Mao's words, we fear neither heaven nor earth. This high tide has not only promoted the in-depth development of the Socialist Education Movement, but also vigorously promoted the development of farmland capital construction and the winter and spring production movement.

    After discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed that allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take deep root among the vast cadres and masses through the Socialist Education Movement is a fundamental measure to eradicate revisionism, feudalism, and capitalism, and is also the fundamental task of the Socialist Education Movement. As long as this root is deeply and firmly planted among cadres and masses, preventing the emergence of revisionism, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism and communism will have a solid political foundation, ideological foundation, and mass foundation. This is a historical task, and it must be rooted generation after generation. It is not easy to plant it so deeply at once in the Socialist Education Movement, but as long as we grasp it tightly, it will always be planted deeper and firmer step by step, so that the vast cadres and masses can learn Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to it, and pass it on.

    The meeting listened to the experience introductions of cadres from seven units, including the Lijia Brigade in Liaoyang County, the Lizhi Brigade, the Guantun Brigade in Yingkou County, and the Xiafangshen Brigade in Haicheng County, and some production teams on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively in the Socialist Education Movement; as well as the experiences these units had explored in allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root among cadres and masses. Based on the experiences of these units and the situations in various localities, the meeting conducted research on how to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively in the Socialist Education Movement, and how to allow Mao Zedong Thought to take root among cadres and masses. Everyone believed that: So-called rooting means that, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, the following fundamental viewpoints must be clearly and firmly established among cadres and masses:

    First, there must be the view of adhering to carrying out the socialist revolution to the end and building communism. That is to take class struggle as the key link, better and more comprehensively implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continuously and deeply carry out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, adhere to socialism, and move towards communism.

    Second, there must be a clear class viewpoint. It is necessary to implement the Party's class line in rural areas, firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, establish the class superiority of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and solidly unite with the middle peasants and all others who can be united.

    Third, there must be the view of putting politics in command of everything. That is to learn from the People's Liberation Army, highlight politics at all times and in all places, implement the four firsts, oppose the eclecticism that puts politics and business, technology on an equal footing, repeatedly conduct education in socialism, collectivism, patriotism, and internationalism, and continuously improve the awareness of cadres and masses, have the motherland in mind, and have the world in view.

    Fourth, there must be the view of constantly strengthening Party building. Adhere to the nature of the Party as the vanguard of the proletariat, constantly strengthen the Party's leadership core, develop the Party's strength, adhere to the implementation of the Party's democratic centralism, carry forward the Party's three major work styles, adhere to cadres participating in collective labor, and implement the mass line.

    Fifth, there must be the view of striving for progress and relying on our own efforts. Carry forward the Yan'an spirit, carry forward the Daqing and Dazhai spirit, boost morale, strive for the upper reaches, carry out mass movements of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, transform nature, and develop production and various construction undertakings.

    The meeting then summarized several experiences on how to achieve the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the leading core and among different masses. The meeting held that: To make Mao Zedong Thought take root in rural areas, the leading core must first and foremost put Mao Zedong Thought in command at all times and in all places. The most basic link in the leading core is the brigade Party branch (including the Party小组 of the production team). The meeting held that production brigades and production teams are the grassroots organizations closest to the masses. If the roots of Mao Zedong Thought are not well planted in these two levels of cadres, everything will be without foundation. As the masses said: "Villages look at villages, households look at households, the masses look at cadres, and cadres look at the Party branch." "If the core studies well, we will follow. If the branch doesn't take the lead, the members will be worried." Judging from the experience of various places, organizing these two levels of cadres to study Chairman Mao's works is of utmost importance.

    The meeting emphasized: To allow Mao Zedong Thought to take root in production brigades and production teams, the problem of the guiding ideology and leadership style of the Party committees above the commune level must be solved. If the leadership above does not realize revolutionization, the roots below will not be well planted, and even if they are well planted, they will be impacted and will not be able to persist. The meeting called on Party committees at all levels to use the problem to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, and treat the work of rooting Mao Zedong Thought from top to bottom as a major event and treat it seriously.

    The meeting pointed out that to allow Mao Zedong Thought to take root among the masses, we must first focus on organizing the old poor and lower-middle peasants, youth, and women to study and use Chairman Mao's works well. Because the old poor and lower-middle peasants suffered the most in the old society, they have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works. Today, they are not only an important force in carrying out the three great revolutionary struggles in rural areas, but also an important force in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, combining theory with practice, and using Mao Zedong Thought to conduct class education for the younger generation; youth are the main force on the production front line and where our hope lies. To prevent revisionism from emerging in the third and fourth generations, we must arm them with Mao Zedong Thought; women are "half the sky," and organizing the vast number of women to study Chairman Mao's works is also an important task. Experience has proven that housewives can also study Chairman Mao's works. The meeting believed that organizing these three groups of people to study and use Chairman Mao's works well laid the foundation for Mao Zedong Thought to take root among the peasant masses. The meeting pointed out that allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root among the peasant masses means using the proletarian world outlook to educate and transform the peasants, revolutionizing the peasant masses, and farming for the revolution. As an old poor peasant said: "Being a peasant also depends on what kind of peasant you are. In the past, they were exploited peasants, selfish and self-employed peasants. Now, we must be peasants with socialist awareness, and revolutionary peasants."

    The meeting called on Party committees at all levels and comrades participating in the Socialist Education Movement to consciously put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, promote everything, and transform everything. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying, studying diligently and assiduously, taking the lead in using, using practically and conscientiously, and truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Only by setting an example and showing how it's done can we lead the masses to study well and be competent to undertake the task of rooting Mao Zedong Thought among cadres and masses.

    The meeting finally emphasized that the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works and allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take deep root among cadres and masses is a fundamental construction for educating cadres, educating Party members, and educating peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and it should not be regarded as an expedient measure, as a means to simply complete certain tasks. In the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, we must strengthen ideological leadership, pay attention to grasping ideological trends, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The methods and organizational forms of study must be flexible, diverse, and lively according to specific circumstances, adapting to people, places, times, and things. To allow Mao Zedong Thought to take root among cadres and masses, we also need to implement the leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, combining general calls with individual guidance, and combining leading backbones with the broad masses, conscientiously concentrate the wisdom and creativity of the masses, conscientiously study and summarize typical examples, and conscientiously establish and cultivate a team of activists who are closely connected with the masses.

    东北局和辽宁省委召开会议讨论农村如何突出政治问题
    让毛泽东思想在干部群众中扎根
    是社会主义教育运动的根本任务
    新华社沈阳二十三日电  中共中央东北局和中共辽宁省委最近在鞍山市召开会议，讨论如何在农村中突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装农村干部和群众的问题。会议号召全区各级党委要通过社会主义教育运动，让毛泽东思想在农村干部群众中扎下根子。
    参加这次会议的有中共中央东北局第一书记宋任穷、第三书记马明方、候补书记喻屏、辽宁省委书记处书记李荒等，以及鞍山、营口、旅大等市的市委，部分县委、人民公社党委和生产大队、生产队的同志。
    会议认为，自从开展社会主义教育运动以来，特别是今年一月中共中央东北局提出要通过社会主义教育运动，让毛泽东思想在群众中深深扎根，东北地区广大干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作已经形成高潮。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已经成为成千成万人的行动。关心集体、舍己为公、团结互助的风气大大发扬，好人好事不断涌现。有的群众说：学了毛主席的书，心红眼亮骨头硬，听了毛主席的话，天不怕地不怕。这个高潮，不但推动了社会主义教育运动深入发展，也有力地促进了农田基本建设和冬春季生产运动的开展。
    会议经过讨论一致认为，通过社会主义教育运动，让毛泽东思想在广大干部和群众中深深扎下根子，是挖掉修正主义、封建主义和资本主义根子的根本措施，也是社会主义教育运动的根本任务。只要在干部和群众中把这个根子扎深、扎牢，防止修正主义的产生，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义和共产主义就有了雄厚的政治基础、思想基础和群众基础。这是一个历史任务，要一代一代地扎下去。在社会主义教育运动中，一下就扎得那么深是不容易的，但是只要抓紧去做，总会一步一步地扎深扎牢，使广大干部和群众把毛泽东思想学到手，坚持住，传下去。
    会议听取了辽阳县李家大队、营口县立志大队、官屯大队、海城县下房身大队等七个单位和一些生产队的干部关于在社会主义教育运动中活学活用毛主席著作的经验介绍；以及这些单位所摸索到的让毛泽东思想在干部群众中扎根的经验。会议根据这些单位的经验和各地的情况，对在社会主义教育运动中怎样活学活用毛主席著作，怎样让毛泽东思想在干部和群众中扎根等问题进行了研究。大家认为：所谓扎根，就是要按照毛主席的教导，在干部和群众中明确地牢固地树立以下几个根本的观点：
    第一、要有坚持把社会主义革命进行到底和建设共产主义的观点。就是要以阶级斗争为纲，更好地更全面地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，不断地深入开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，坚持社会主义，走向共产主义。
    第二、要有明确的阶级观点。要贯彻执行党在农村中的阶级路线，坚定地依靠贫农下中农，树立贫农下中农的阶级优势，巩固地团结中农和其他一切可以团结的人。
    第三、要有以政治统帅一切的观点。就是要大学解放军，时时处处突出政治，落实四个第一，反对那种把政治与业务、技术平列起来的折衷主义，反复地进行社会主义、集体主义、爱国主义、国际主义的教育，不断地提高干部和群众的觉悟，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。
    第四、要有不断地加强党的建设的观点。坚持党的无产阶级先锋队的性质，不断地加强党的领导核心，发展党的力量，坚持贯彻执行党的民主集中制，发扬党的三大作风，坚持干部参加集体劳动，贯彻群众路线。
    第五、要有奋发图强，自力更生的观点。发扬延安精神，发扬大庆、大寨精神，鼓干劲，争上游，开展比学赶帮超的群众运动，改造自然，发展生产和各项建设事业。
    会议接着就如何在领导核心、不同的群众中做到活学活用毛主席著作问题，分别归纳出几条经验。会议认为：要使毛泽东思想在农村中扎根，首先是领导核心要时时处处以毛泽东思想挂帅。领导核心的最基本的环节是大队党支部（包括生产队的党小组）。会议认为，生产大队和生产队是最接近群众的基层组织，在这两级干部中如果不把毛泽东思想的根子扎好，一切都没有基础。正如群众说的：“村看村，户看户，群众看干部，干部看的党支部”，“核心学得好，我们跟着跑，支部不带头，社员就发愁”。从各地的经验看，组织这两级干部学习毛主席著作，有着十分重要的意义。
    会议强调指出：要让毛泽东思想在生产大队和生产队扎根，必须解决好公社以上党委的领导思想和领导作风问题。上边领导不实现革命化，下边的根子就扎不好，就是扎好，也会受到冲击，不能坚持下去。会议号召各级党委都要带着这个问题，活学活用毛主席著作，从上到下都把毛泽东思想扎根工作当作一件大事去做，认真对待。
    会议指出，要让毛泽东思想在群众中扎根，首先要着重组织老贫下中农、青年和妇女这三部分人学好用好毛主席著作。因为老贫下中农在旧社会受苦最深，对毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情，今天他们不仅是农村进行三大革命斗争的重要力量，也是活学活用毛主席著作，结合实际，运用毛泽东思想对青年一代进行阶级教育的重要力量；青年是生产第一线的主力，是我们希望的所在，要第三代第四代不出修正主义，就要用毛泽东思想武装他们；妇女是“半边天”，组织广大妇女学习毛主席著作也是一件重要工作，经验证明，家庭妇女同样可以学习毛主席著作。会议认为，组织这三部分人学好用好毛主席著作，就为毛泽东思想在农民群众中扎根打下了基础。会议指出，让毛泽东思想在农民群众中扎根，就是要用无产阶级世界观教育农民，改造农民，使农民群众革命化，为革命而种田。正如一个老贫农说的那样：“当农民也要看当什么样的农民，过去是受剥削的农民，是自私自利单干的农民，现在要当有社会主义觉悟的农民，当革命的农民”。
    会议号召各级党委和参加社会主义教育运动的同志，自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。各级领导干部都要带头学，刻苦勤奋地学，带头用，扎扎实实地用，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。只有以身作则，做出样子，才能很好地领导群众学习，才能胜任愉快地担负起把毛泽东思想在干部和群众中扎根的任务。
    会议最后着重指出：活学活用毛主席著作，让毛泽东思想在干部和群众中深深地扎下根子，是用毛泽东思想教育干部、教育党员、教育农民的根本建设，不能把它当作权宜之计，当成只是完成某些任务的手段。在学习毛主席著作运动中，要加强思想领导，注意抓思想苗头，及时发现和解决问题。学习的方法和组织形式，必须根据具体情况，因人因地因时因事制宜，灵活多样，生动活泼。要让毛泽东思想在干部和群众中扎根，同样需要实行从群众中来到群众中去、一般号召和个别指导相结合、领导骨干和广大群众相结合的领导方法，认真集中群众的智慧和创造，认真研究和总结典型，认真建立和培养密切联系群众的积极分子队伍。
