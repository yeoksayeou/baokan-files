    Comprehensive utilization of resources is a major technical and economic policy of the Party and the state for developing socialist industrial production, an extremely important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy, and an important working link in implementing the Party's general line and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    **Using the Viewpoint of "One Divides into Two" to Look at Resource Utilization**

    In industrial production practice, whether resources can be comprehensively utilized well ultimately comes down to the question of whether the law of dialectical "one divides into two" can be used to observe and treat objective things.

    The opposite of comprehensive resource utilization is single resource utilization. To achieve comprehensive resource utilization, it is necessary, in the process of industrial production, to oppose the one-sided utilization of raw materials, materials, and fuel resources, and the single production of some main products that are indeed urgently needed at the moment, while discarding some by-products that are produced at the same time, and are clearly useful and can be used, as "waste." Only by striving to take the road of comprehensive resource utilization, so that industrial production continuously advances in depth and breadth, can it be gradually achieved that "waste" is not wasted, and everything is used to its fullest.

    Making the best use of everything is to fundamentally realize an ideal of socialist industrial production, which is to achieve the maximum degree of economy in raw materials, materials, and fuels, that is, to achieve the maximum possible increase in the production of raw materials, materials, fuels, and their processed products.

    In recent years, various departments and regions have done a lot of work and achieved many results in the comprehensive utilization of resources. For example, mechanical coking ovens have basically recovered chemical raw materials such as benzene and tar; blast furnace slag is widely used as mineral wool and slag cement. However, generally speaking, the work in this area is still far behind the requirements of national economic development. At present, there are still some departments and enterprises that talk about comprehensive resource utilization every year, but in reality, they rarely take more effective measures, and as a result, many resources have not yet been comprehensively utilized. In the raw material industry, the material industry, and the fuel industry, there are many man-made "waste gases, waste liquids, waste residues, waste heat, and waste energy"; in the processing industry, there are many man-made "waste materials, waste scraps, and waste parts." Under the word "waste," many valuable resources are lost in vain. This is a great waste.

    With the rapid development of industrial production, the resources that can be comprehensively utilized are also growing rapidly. If we only talk about increasing production, and not about practicing economy; if we only unilaterally and massively develop the single utilization of resources, and not correspondingly develop the comprehensive utilization of resources on a large scale, then this great waste will expand. The nature of the problem will become the question of whether or not to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Chairman Mao taught us that any objective thing can be divided into two. Production practice also tells us that there is never a single component or single element in nature, and therefore only things that can be used in a single way. Air is certainly a mixture; even pure water contains a very small amount of heavy water. In the process of industrial production, the processing object must be transformed into a finished product, whether it is mechanical processing or chemical processing, is a process of "one divides into two," and often a continuous process of "one divides into two" multiple times. If we guide industrial production according to the laws derived from the objective things themselves, we must do everything possible to adopt methods of comprehensive resource utilization and develop multi-variety production.

    **Comprehensive Utilization of Raw Material, Material, and Fuel Industries**

    The comprehensive utilization of raw material, material, and fuel industries is a major issue that needs to be taken seriously. For example, using coal to generate electricity, coal is divided into two under combustion conditions: the combustible substances generate heat and electricity; the incombustible substances become ash and slag. In a country with a basic industrial foundation, it is common for so many thermal power plants to discharge millions of tons of ash and slag every year. Some power plants, when the natural terrain is not conducive to the massive stacking of ash and slag, will occupy large areas of farmland as ash disposal sites, and even silt up nearby rivers. However, these industrial ash and slag that have to be discarded are good raw materials for the building materials industry to manufacture bricks, ceramsite, and blocks. The best way is to develop more cooperation between thermal power plants and brick factories, with one saving ash disposal sites and the other saving raw material sites, and farmland and rivers can also be less threatened. The so-called "waste slag" will then have a way out. Every million tons of ash and slag can make six to seven hundred million bricks. Utilizing four to five million tons of ash and slag every year to manufacture two to three billion bricks to support socialist infrastructure construction is indeed a major event.

    Timber harvested in forest areas is transported to sawmills, and the logs are processed into finished timber, which is the process of trees being mechanically processed several times in a row. In the forest areas, the logs that are easy to collect and transport are transported away, and the branches, etc., that are not easy to collect and transport are left behind. The branches, etc., are also composed of wood fibers, and they become "waste materials" simply because of different specifications, and remain in large quantities in the forest areas, which not only affects the nurturing and renewal of the forest, but also easily causes accidents such as spontaneous combustion. Therefore, it is best to slice and pack the branches, etc., and transport them out of the forest area to use them to develop the production of fiberboard. Also, in the sawmill, the part of the log that meets the specifications becomes finished timber, and the remaining scraps, shavings, and sawdust that do not meet the specifications are also regarded as "waste materials" and downgraded to civilian fuel. It is best to bond and hot-press the processed residues of this wood, change its broken shape, make it meet certain specifications, and develop the production of particleboard, shavings board, etc. In this way, the artificial wood made from processing waste in the process from harvesting to wood production can become high-quality building materials and unique furniture materials; the utilization rate of wood can also be increased to more than 90%. Every production of ten million cubic meters of finished timber, and at the same time, an increase in production of four to five million cubic meters of artificial wood, this is the greatest saving and greatest increase in the production of wood itself.

    The smelting and processing of symbiotic minerals requires separating and purifying multiple metals and non-metals, and then rationally utilizing them separately, which is itself a comprehensive utilization of natural resources. China is rich in many types of iron ore, some of which are symbiotic with copper and cobalt, some with vanadium and titanium, some with tantalum and niobium, and some with rare earth metals. These symbiotic minerals often exceed the value of the iron ore itself, and are conducive to the development of a variety of special alloy steels. China also contains many types of multi-element non-ferrous metal ores, often with several, dozens of symbiotic elements appearing at the same time, and therefore, to refine copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, cobalt, bismuth, etc., to refine gold, silver, platinum group elements, etc., to refine many semiconductor elements and rare and dispersed elements, etc., it has great natural conditions. Complex minerals can find certain laws, decompose into many simple minerals, and then be utilized separately; many simple technologies can also be integrated into complex production processes under certain conditions to comprehensively process complex symbiotic minerals. For China's so abundant symbiotic minerals, we should specifically analyze them, treat them differently, give play to the wisdom of the masses, master complete sets of excellent technologies, and conduct comprehensive exploration, comprehensive development, and comprehensive processing and utilization.

    As for the highly comprehensive utilization of oilfield gas, natural gas, and refinery by-product gas to develop the petrochemical industry, it is a good model for opening up new fields of industrial production.

    **Comprehensive Utilization of the Processing Industry**

    The raw material industry, the material industry, and the fuel industry must take the road of comprehensive utilization of natural resources, and the processing industry must also take the road of comprehensive utilization of industrial resources such as raw materials, materials, and fuels.

    Taking light industry as an example. With the rapid development of light industry, there are thousands of light industrial products serving the people's lives. The widespread development of comprehensive utilization of raw materials, materials, and fuels is also colorful, with great potential and great promise.

    For example, in cotton ginning factories and oil pressing factories, try to recover cotton linters as much as possible, and in cotton textile factories, try to recover waste flowers and waste yarns as much as possible, for the production of rayon, photosensitive film, and smokeless gunpowder. In slaughterhouses, extensively promote the stripping of pigskins for leather making; recover pig bones to extract bone glue and grind bone meal; select a portion of pig offal to extract various drugs. In sugar factories, fully utilize by-product molasses to ferment and manufacture organic chemical raw materials such as alcohol, acetone, and butanol; use a large amount of bagasse, part of which replaces fuel and part of which is used for papermaking; use a large amount of beet pulp as feed. In salt fields, extensively promote the extraction of chemical products such as bromine, iodine, boron, strontium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium from by-product bittern. In paper mills, properly treat a large amount of waste pulp liquor and recover alkali and widely used lignin adhesives from it. In aquatic product processing plants, extensively utilize fish scales, fish offal, fish bones, shrimp shells, shellfish, seaweed roots, etc., to extract various vitamins and scarce drugs, and use processing residues as feed and fertilizer. In this way, almost all products of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery that provide raw materials for light industry can be comprehensively processed and utilized. Many production tasks that are difficult to complete by single utilization can be taken strides by taking the road of comprehensive utilization, and produce various colorful by-products. From this, it can be seen that correctly handling the relationship between main products and by-products can often seek less from more and more from less; seek savings from good and speed from savings; both the main and auxiliary are beneficial, and they complement each other. It is particularly easy for light industry to achieve fast construction, low investment, great results, and more accumulation by taking the road of comprehensive utilization. Moreover, vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery products will inevitably be conducive to expanding the collective income and personal income of farmers, accelerating the development of the rural collective economy, accelerating the development of production undertakings that combine industry and agriculture, and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    Certain chemical industries that deeply process raw materials, materials, and fuels have special flexibility and diversity in terms of comprehensive utilization. For example, the rubber processing industry and the plastics processing industry can recover a large number of old products and implement multiple recycling. As another example, in the pharmaceutical industry, the dye industry, the pesticide industry, and the chemical reagent auxiliary agent industry, it is most clearly told to people that there has never been a single and unidirectional chemical reaction completed. Controlling the special conditions under which the main reaction and the side reaction are taking place, the external causes act through the internal causes to produce different changes, so the products produced and the raw materials recovered never exist in a single state. Multi-variety joint production and repeated recycling of various raw materials are often the characteristics of these chemical industries, and even in the "waste liquid" of chemical sewage, some residual chemical substances can be recovered and new products can be separated from them. In these chemical industries, continuously following the mass line, widely adopting reasonable and legitimate suggestions, and taking effective measures can promote the comprehensive utilization work to develop rapidly with each passing day.

    The machinery industry is a basic industry and also a processing industry that mainly mechanically processes metal materials. In each mechanical processing step, a large amount of cutting, planing, milling, drilling... is carried out, while mechanical products are produced day and night, various edges, corners, waste materials, waste scraps, and even some small quantities of unqualified parts, components, and semi-finished products that are inevitably produced from the remaining metal materials are produced day and night. These waste metal materials can be classified and recovered according to different materials, centrally processed, and after selecting a part of the handicraft recycling processing materials from them, they become a large number of high-quality furnace materials needed by the metallurgical industry. This is an indispensable cycle, turnover, and reproduction process of a part of metal materials between departments. Under the guidance of the policy of self-reliance, China relies on its own machinery industry to equip various departments of the national economy, producing so many mechanical products every year, and at the same time, producing so many metal materials remaining from processing every year. This is a large amount of "waste metal" resources that must be planned for recovery and used to support the production of the metallurgical industry.

    Looking at a slightly larger scope, all departments of the national economy that use mechanical equipment for production inevitably wear and damage some mechanical equipment during the production process. Therefore, it is inevitable that some waste old parts will be replaced during equipment maintenance and some waste old equipment will be replaced during equipment transformation and upgrading. Similarly, the more metal products used in society, the more waste metal products are metabolized. Every industrial city often recovers thousands of tons, tens of thousands of tons, or hundreds of thousands of tons of waste metal materials from these aspects every year, so how large a "waste metal" resource should it be nationwide. The tens of thousands of rural people's communes across the country also have a large amount of "waste metal" resources that can be recovered every year due to the increasing number of mechanical products and metal products supporting agriculture. There are broken and rotten "broken copper, rotten iron, residual lead, and discarded aluminum" everywhere, and they cannot be underestimated. Their grades are all above 90%, which is better than the general grades of non-ferrous metal ores with only 1% to a few percent, and better than the general grades of lean iron ores with only 30% or less, how good they are to the metallurgical industry! You can find "treasures" from "waste" everywhere and turn the useless into the useful. Fully doing a good job in the recovery and utilization of waste metals to support the industrial production of metal materials is of particularly great political and economic significance. This is a work with great prospects and great potential.

    **Vigorously Develop the Comprehensive Utilization of Resources**

    In the field of industrial production, from all kinds of raw material industries, material industries, and fuel industries to all kinds of processing industries that utilize raw materials, materials, and fuels, there are roughly four aspects of the comprehensive utilization of resources intertwined. Specifically, one is the comprehensive utilization of metal and non-metal mineral resources, the second is the comprehensive utilization of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery products, the third is the recycling and comprehensive utilization of materials remaining from various processing and waste old articles, and the fourth is the recovery and utilization of heat energy in the industrial production process.

    In carrying out these four aspects of work, it can be required by two levels of standards. The most fundamental requirement is to make the current man-made "waste" as soon as possible to achieve at least the minimum of making the best use of everything. At the same time, we should strive to advance in depth and breadth and develop more advanced comprehensive utilization and making the best use of everything.

    At present, to achieve making the best use of everything as soon as possible, we must especially seize the above four aspects of resources and make full use of the eight kinds of man-made "waste" (namely: "waste gas, waste liquid, waste residue, waste heat, waste energy, waste material, waste scrap, waste part"). We must ideologically realize that the large-scale existence of the above eight kinds of man-made "waste" is synonymous with the man-made large-scale waste of raw materials, materials, and fuels. We must be determined to resolve the contradiction between increasing the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels and wasting raw materials, materials, and fuels, and use materialist dialectics to take the road of comprehensive utilization.

    In industrial production, objective things, from natural resources to production processes, have internal connections. Comprehensive utilization is precisely to do things according to objective laws, so that waste is not wasted, a large number of by-products are produced, so as to facilitate the comprehensive development of productivity. Therefore, we must strive to promote two ways of comprehensive utilization of resources. One way is to develop joint enterprises, develop multi-variety joint production, and develop continuous multiple processing. For example, joint enterprises of non-ferrous-chemical-steel-building materials-electricity; joint enterprises of petroleum-chemical-electricity. The other way is to develop production cooperation between enterprises according to appropriate specialization, develop fixed-point recovery, fixed-point supply of raw materials, materials, and fuel resources, and organize complete sets of processing. For example, fixed-point supply of serpentinite from the surrounding rock of asbestos mines to calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants, from which nickel-phosphorus iron is recovered for fixed-point supply to steel plants for blowing nickel iron, and then fixed-point smelting of stainless steel. The common premise of the promotion of these two production methods is that we must break the old framework of each department managing its own affairs, fighting alone, being careless, and eating the rich and abandoning the poor between departments, and resolutely take the road of comprehensive resource utilization.

    We want to take the road of comprehensive utilization of resources. We should see that through repeated production practice and repeated summing up of experience, people are able to understand the laws and gain the initiative; at the same time, we should also see that taking the road of comprehensive utilization of resources will encounter many difficulties. It should be admitted that our work on comprehensive resource utilization has just begun, and there are many new problems and new things that we do not know much about, or even know very little about. "The majestic pass is really like iron, but now we are striding forward from scratch." We should adopt a down-to-earth scientific attitude, work hard, learn from practice, and overcome various difficulties step by step.

    Chairman Mao has always taught us to attach importance to the work of comprehensive resource utilization and has repeatedly shown concern for the development of this work. As early as 1958, when inspecting Wuhan Iron and Steel, Chairman Mao instructed that more comprehensive joint enterprises should be established and multi-variety production should be developed. We should check the work of the past few years from a high standard, divide it into two, and conscientiously sum up experience and strive to move forward. In this first year of entering the third five-year plan, the work of comprehensive resource utilization must be adapted to the victorious development situation of the national economy. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us grasp, grasp well, and grasp the work of comprehensive resource utilization according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    *Editor's Note:* Objective things have always been divided into two. There is never a single component or a single element in nature, and therefore only things that can be used in a single way. Vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of resources is precisely doing things according to the objective laws of things, comprehensively developing productive forces, and carrying out socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. From the several articles published in this newspaper today, it can be seen that there is a vast world in the comprehensive utilization of resources, and there is much that can be done. Let us, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, widely develop the comprehensive utilization work of the raw material, material, and fuel industry and the processing industry, and gradually utilize all the "waste gas, waste liquid, waste residue, waste heat, waste energy, waste material, waste scrap, and waste parts" in industrial production, and turn one use into multiple uses, and turn the useless into the useful. This is a great increase in production and practicing economy.

    资源的综合利用是增产节约的一个重要方面
    薛葆鼎
    资源的综合利用，是党和国家发展社会主义工业生产的一项重大技术经济政策，是增产节约的一个极其重要的方面，是执行党的总路线、多快好省地建设社会主义的一个重要工作环节。
    用一分为二的观点来看待资源的利用
    在工业生产实践中，能不能很好地综合利用资源的问题，归根到底，是一个能不能运用一分为二的辩证法规律，来观察和对待客观事物的问题。
    资源综合利用的对立面，是资源的单一利用。要实现资源的综合利用，就是要在工业生产的过程中，反对片面地利用原料、材料、燃料的资源，单一地生产一些的确为眼前所急迫需要的主产品，而把一些同时生产出来的、明明还有用而且也能用的副产品，当作“废物”抛弃掉。只有努力走资源综合利用的道路，使工业生产不断地向深度和广度进军，才能够逐步做到“废物”不废，物尽其用。
    物尽其用，就是要在根本上实现社会主义工业生产的一项理想，这就是实现对原料、材料、燃料最大程度的节约，也就是实现对原料、材料、燃料和它们的加工产品最大可能的增产。
    几年来，各个部门和各个地方，在资源的综合利用方面，做了不少的工作，取得了不少的成绩。例如，机械炼焦炉基本上都回收了苯和焦油等化工原料；高炉渣大量用作矿渣棉和矿渣水泥等。但是，总的说来，这一方面的工作，还远远落后于国民经济发展的要求。现在，还有那么一些部门和企业，年年讲资源综合利用，实际上却很少采取更为有效的措施，结果，有很多资源至今还没有能够得到综合利用。在原料工业、材料工业、燃料工业中，出现了许多人为的“废气、废液、废渣、废热、废能”；在加工工业中，出现了许多人为的“废料、废屑、废件”。在一个“废”字底下，许多宝贵的资源，被白白损失了。这是一笔很大的浪费。
    随着工业生产的飞快发展，可以综合利用的资源，也在飞快增长。如果只讲增产，而不讲节约；如果只片面大量发展单一利用资源，而不相应地大量发展综合利用资源，那么，这一笔很大的浪费，还会扩大。问题的性质，就将变为要不要多快好省地建设社会主义的问题。
    毛主席教导我们，任何客观事物都可以一分为二。生产实践也告诉我们，自然界从来不存在单一成分、或者单一元素、因而只能单一利用的东西。空气固然是混合物；纯粹的水中也有极小量的重水存在。在工业生产的过程中，加工对象要变为成品，不论是机械加工的性质，或者是化学加工的性质，都是一个一分为二的过程，而且往往是连续多次一分为二的过程。要是按照客观事物本身引出的规律来指导工业生产，就得尽一切可能采取综合利用资源的方法，发展多品种的生产。
    原料、材料、燃料工业的综合利用
    原料工业、材料工业、燃料工业的综合利用，是一件需要认真对待的大事情。比如说，利用煤炭发电，煤炭在燃烧的条件下一分为二，可燃的物质发了热、发了电；不可燃的物质成了烟灰、炉渣。在一个工业有了点基础的国家里，从那么多的火力发电厂里，每年排出几百万吨灰渣，是平常的事。有些电厂，遇到自然地形不利于大量堆放灰渣的时候，就会大面积占用农田作排灰场，甚至淤塞近旁的河流。但是，这些不得不抛弃的工业灰渣，对于建筑材料工业来说，却是制造砖、陶粒、砌块的好原料。最好的办法是多发展火力电厂和砖厂之间的协作，一个省去排灰场，一个省去原料场，农田河流也可以少受一点威胁。所谓“废渣”，也就有了出路。每一百万吨灰渣，可以制砖六、七亿块。每年利用四、五百万吨灰渣，制造二、三十亿块砖，来支援社会主义基本建设，确实是一件大事。
    林区采伐的木材，运进锯木厂，把原木加工为成品材，是树木被连续几次机械加工的过程。在林区里，便于集运的原木运走了，不便于集运的枝丫等留下了。枝丫等，同样是木纤维组成的，仅仅由于规格不同，就成了“废料”，大量留在林区里，既影响森林的抚育更新，又容易引起自燃等意外。因此，最好是把枝丫等切片、打包，运出林区，利用它来发展纤维板的生产。还有，在锯木厂里，合乎规格的那一部分原木变成了成品材，不合乎规格的边角余料、刨花、锯屑，也就当作“废料”，降为民用燃料。最好是把这种木材的加工剩余物，进行粘合、热压，改变它破碎的形状，使它合乎一定的规格，发展碎木板、刨花板等的生产。这样，从采伐到制材的过程中，利用加工废料制成的人造木材，又可以成为上等建筑材料和独具一格的家具用材；木材的利用率，也可提高到百分之九十以上。每生产一千万立方米成品材，同时增产四、五百万立方米人造木材，这是在生产过程中木材本身的最大节约和最大增产。
    共生矿物的冶炼加工，要把多种金属和非金属分离、提纯好，再分别合理利用，其本身就是综合利用自然资源。我国蕴藏许多类型的铁矿，有的与铜、钴共生，有的与钒、钛共生，有的与钽、铌共生，有的与稀土金属共生。这些共生矿物，往往超过铁矿自身的价值，有利于发展多种特殊的合金钢材。我国还蕴藏许多类型的多元素有色金属矿，往往几种、十几种共生元素同时出现，因而，要提炼铜、铅、锌、钨、锡、钼、钴、铋等，要提炼黄金、白银、铂族元素等，要提炼许多半导体元素和稀散元素等，都具备大好的自然条件。复杂的矿物，可以找出一定的规律，分解为许多简单的矿物，再分别加以利用，许多简单的技术，又可以在一定条件下，综合成复杂的生产流程，来综合处理复杂的共生矿物。对于我国这么丰富的共生矿物，应当具体分析，区别对待，应当发挥人民群众的智慧，掌握成套的精良技术，进行综合勘探，综合开发，综合加工利用。
    至于高度综合利用油田气、天然气、炼油副产气，发展石油化学工业，更是开辟工业生产新领域的好典型。
    加工工业的综合利用
    原料工业、材料工业、燃料工业要走综合利用自然资源的道路，加工工业也要走综合利用原料、材料、燃料等工业资源的道路。
    以轻工业为例。随着轻工业的飞跃发展，为人民生活服务的轻工业产品，成千上万种，广泛地开展综合利用原料、材料、燃料的工作，也是五光十色，大有潜力，大有可为。
    比如，在轧花厂、榨油厂中尽量回收棉籽绒，在棉纺织厂中尽量回收废花废纱，用来发展人造纤维、感光胶片、无烟火药的生产。在屠宰场中大量推广剥取猪皮，用以制革；回收猪骨，提取骨胶，磨制骨粉；选取一部分猪内脏，提取多种药物。在糖厂中充分利用副产糖蜜，发酵制造酒精、丙酮、丁醇等有机化工原料；利用大量蔗渣，一部分代替燃料，一部分造纸；利用大量甜菜丝干作饲料。在盐场内大量推广从副产的盐卤中提取溴、碘、硼、锶、锂、镁、钾、钙等的化工产品。在造纸厂中处理好大量纸浆废液，从中回收碱和用途很广的木质素粘合剂。在水产加工厂中大量利用鱼鳞、鱼内脏、鱼骨、虾皮、贝壳、海带根等等，提取多种维生素和稀缺的药物，并且利用加工残渣作饲料、肥料。诸如此类，凡是农林牧副渔的产品，提供轻工业作原料的，几乎没有不能综合加工利用的。许多单一利用所难以完成的生产任务，走综合利用的道路，就能迈开步伐，搞出形形色色、丰富多采的副产品来。由此可见，正确处理好主产品与副产品的关系，往往就能多中求少，少中出多；好中求省，省中出快；主副两利，相反相成。轻工业走综合利用的道路，格外容易做到建设快、投资省、收效大、积累多。而且大力开展农林牧副渔产品的综合利用，必然有利于扩大农民的集体收入和个人收入，加快发展农村集体经济，加快发展亦工亦农的生产事业，进一步巩固工农联盟。
    某些对原料、材料、燃料进行深度加工的化学工业，在综合利用方面，具有特殊的灵活性和多样性。比如，橡胶加工工业和塑料加工工业，都能回收大量的破旧产品，实行多次再生利用。再如，在医药工业、染料工业、农药工业、化学试剂辅剂助剂工业中，最明显地告诉人们，从来没有单一而单向完成的化学反应。控制主反应和副反应所在进行的特殊条件，外因通过内因起作用而发生各不相同的变化，从而产生的产品和回收到的原料，也从来不存在单一出现的状态。多品种联合生产，多种原料反复回收利用，往往是这些化学工业的特点，甚至在化学污水的“废液”中，还能回收到一些残留的化学物质，从中分离出新产品来。在这些化学工业中，不断地走群众路线，广泛采取合情合理的建议，采取有效的措施，就能推动综合利用工作日新月异地发展。
    机械工业，是基础工业，又主要是对金属材料进行机械加工的加工工业。在各个机械加工的工序上，大量进行切、削、刨、铣、钻……，一边日日夜夜产生出机械产品，一边日日夜夜产生出各种金属材料加工剩余下来的边角、废料、废屑，乃至不可避免地还产生出一些少量不合格的零件、部件、半制品。这些废金属材料，都可以按照不同的材质，分类回收，集中处理，从中选出一部分手工业再生加工材料之后，就大量成为冶金工业所需要的上等炉料。这是一部分金属材料，在部门之间不可少的循环周转、再生产过程。我国在自力更生的方针指引下，依靠自己的机械工业，来装备国民经济的各个部门，每年生产那么多的机械产品，同时，每年也产生出那么多加工剩余的金属材料。这是一大笔一定要有计划回收、用来支援冶金工业生产的“废金属”资源。
    再放大一点范围看，国民经济各个部门凡是利用机械设备进行生产的，都在生产过程中不可避免地要磨耗、损坏着一些机械设备。因此，必然会周期性地在设备检修中换下一些废旧配件，在设备改造、更新中换下一些废旧设备。同样，在社会上使用的金属制品越多，代谢下来的废金属制品也越多。每一个工业城市，每年从这些方面回收到的废金属材料往往是几千吨、几万吨、几十万吨，全国又该是多么大的一笔“废金属”资源。全国几万个农村人民公社，由于支援农业的机械产品和金属制品的日益增多，每年也有一大笔能回收到的“废金属”资源。到处有用坏、用烂了的“破铜、烂铁、残铅、弃铝”，可不能小看它们。它们的品位都在百分之九十以上，比之一般品位只在百分之一到百分之几的有色金属矿，比之一般品位只有百分之三十以下的贫铁矿，它们对冶金工业是多么好的高品位炉料！到处能从“废物”中找到“宝物”，化无用为有用。充分搞好废金属的回收利用工作，支援金属材料的工业生产，政治上、经济上的意义特别重大。这是一件大有前途，大有作为的工作。
    大力开展资源的综合利用
    在工业生产领域内，从各种各样的原料工业、材料工业、燃料工业，到各种各样利用原料、材料、燃料的加工工业，大致交织着四个方面资源的综合利用。具体说来，一是金属和非金属矿产资源的综合利用，二是农林牧副渔产品的综合利用，三是各种加工剩余的材料和废旧物品回收材料的再生利用、综合利用，四是工业生产过程中热能的回收利用。
    在开展这四个方面的工作上，大体上可以按两级标准要求。最根本的要求是，使当前的人为“废物”，尽快做到最起码的物尽其用。同时，再力求向深度和广度进军，发展更为高级的综合利用和物尽其用。
    当前，要尽快做到物尽其用，特别要抓住上述四个方面的资源，充分利用八种人为的“废物”（即：“废气、废液、废渣、废热、废能、废料、废屑、废件”）。我们一定要从思想上认识到上述八种人为的“废物”的大量存在，就是原料、材料、燃料被人为大量浪费的同义词。我们一定要下决心解决增产原料、材料、燃料与浪费原料、材料、燃料的矛盾，运用唯物辩证法，走综合利用的道路。
    在工业生产中，客观事物，从自然资源到生产流程，都存在着内部联系。综合利用，正是要按客观规律办事，使废物不废，大出副产品，以利于全面发展生产力。因此，我们要努力推广综合利用资源的两种方式。一种方式是发展联合企业、发展多品种的联合生产、发展连续性的多次加工。例如，有色—化工—钢铁—建筑材料—电力的联合企业；石油—化工—电力的联合企业。另一种方式是按照适当的专业化，发展企业之间的生产协作，发展定点回收、定点供应原料、材料、燃料的资源，组织配套成龙的加工。例如，用石棉矿围岩的蛇纹石定点供应钙镁磷肥厂，从此回收镍磷铁定点供应钢铁厂吹炼镍铁，再定点冶炼不锈钢。这两种生产方式的推广，共同的前提是一个，一定要在各部门之间，打破各管各、单打一、丢三拉四、吃富弃贫的老框框，坚决走资源综合利用的道路。
    我们要走综合利用资源的道路，应当看到，通过反复地生产实践、反复地总结经验，人们是能够认识规律、取得主动权的；同时，也应当看到，走综合利用资源的道路，会遇到许多的困难。应当承认，我们对资源综合利用的工作还刚刚开始，有许多新问题、新事物，我们还知之不多，甚至知之甚少。“雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”我们应当采取老老实实的科学态度，艰苦奋斗，从干中学，一步一个脚印地克服各种困难。
    毛主席历来教导我们要重视资源的综合利用工作，多次亲切关怀这方面工作的开展。早在一九五八年视察武钢的时候，毛主席就指示过，要多办点综合性的联合企业，发展点多品种生产。我们对于几年来的工作，应该从高标准检查，一分为二，认真总结经验，努力前进。在这进入第三个五年计划的第一年的时候，资源综合利用工作一定要同国民经济的胜利发展形势相适应。让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，把资源综合利用工作，按照毛主席的指示，抓紧抓好抓起来。
    编者的话：客观事物从来就是一分为二的。自然界从来就不存在单一成分、或者单一元素、因而只能单一利用的东西。大力开展资源的综合利用，正是按照事物的客观规律办事，全面地发展生产力，多快好省地进行社会主义建设。从本报今天发表的几篇文章中，可以看出，在资源的综合利用方面有着广阔的天地，是大有可为的。让我们按照毛主席的指示，把原料、材料、燃料工业和加工工业的综合利用工作广泛地开展起来，逐步地把工业生产中的“废气、废液、废渣、废热、废能、废料、废屑、废件”统统利用起来，化一用为多用，化无用为有用。这就是极大的增产节约。
