    Cart Stage
    Zhou Xirong, Xiangshan Brigade, Sijiqing Commune, Beijing Municipality
    Not long ago, the Beijing Haidian District Pingju Troupe came to the Xiangshan Brigade of the Sijiqing Commune to perform for the broad masses of commune members. Before the performance, the actors of the Pingju Troupe pulled five flatbed carts loaded with props and costumes, walking from the troupe's dormitory to Xiangshan. These five carts were specially made by the troupe for performing for the peasants in the countryside for a long time. When going to the countryside, they are very good transportation tools; during performances, as long as the five carts are put together, they form a very ideal mobile stage.
    The Haidian District Pingju Troupe's cart stage is well designed. This is because they have truly moved the stage to the countryside to perform for the broad masses of peasants. What is even more commendable is that they have made long-term preparations for facing the countryside and serving the peasants, and are determined to train themselves in performing for the peasants. When the comrades of the Pingju Troupe carried props and costumes, walked more than a dozen li of mountain roads, and performed at Guajiatta, a mountain production team of the Xiangshan Brigade, the commune members said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the troupe bring the play up the mountain." "We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Pingju Troupe comrades." The broad masses of commune members not only praised the Pingju Troupe comrades for performing well, but also praised their revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, moving the stage to the countryside to serve the broad masses of peasants.

    大车舞台
    北京市四季青公社香山大队  周锡荣
    不久前，北京市海淀区评剧团到四季青公社香山大队为广大社员演戏。演出前，评剧团的演员同志拉着五个装满道具和服装的平板大车，从剧团宿舍步行到香山。这五个大车是剧团为了长期下乡为农民演戏特制的。下乡时，是很好的运输工具；演出时，只要把五个大车一并，就是一个很理想的活动舞台。
    海淀区评剧团的大车舞台设计得好。这是因为他们真正把舞台搬到了农村，为广大农民演戏。更可贵的是他们对面向农村、为农民服务，作了长远的准备，并且决心在为农民演戏中锻炼自己。当评剧团同志背着道具、服装，走了十几里的山道，到香山大队的山区生产队挂甲塔演出时，社员们说：“只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，剧团才能把戏送上山来。”“我们要学习评剧团同志的革命精神。”广大社员不仅是赞扬评剧团同志戏演得好，而且赞扬他们这种艰苦奋斗，把舞台搬到农村为广大农民服务的革命精神。
