　　Jilin Establishes a Large Number of Sideline Production Bases
　　Producing Fine Varieties, Technology, Experience, and Talent
　　Jilin Province, based on its provincial resources, has established over 300 sideline production bases for seventeen types of products, including reeds, wood ear mushrooms, *Tricholoma mongolicum*, apples, chestnuts, black and white melon seeds, honeybees, and domestic rabbits. These bases will not only provide a large quantity of commodities but also undertake the task of producing fine varieties, technology, experience, and talent.
　　These bases have been established successively since last year. The sidelines they operate are generally projects where local resources are relatively abundant, the masses have a habit of production, and sales are guaranteed. There are also some new projects that involve artificial cultivation and breeding but have broad prospects for development. Last year, relevant provincial departments discovered excellent reeds suitable for weaving mats in Fenghuang Commune, Shulan County, and designated it as a base. Management was strengthened, and in the same year, a large number of reed roots were supplied to 30 counties within the province for propagation. Hunjiang City began planting *Codonopsis pilosula* in 1952, but by 1964, only 380 mu were cultivated in 20 production brigades. After the establishment of sideline production bases last year, it rapidly developed to 1,328 mu planted in 110 production brigades.
　　In order to rapidly promote the development of sideline production, more than 800 technicians and 3,000 peasant technicians were trained last year. Grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have been equipped with full-time sideline production instructors to strengthen the technical force of sideline production.

### 吉林建立大批副业生产基地  出良种、出技术、出经验、出人材

    吉林建立大批副业生产基地
    出良种、出技术、出经验、出人材
    吉林省根据省内资源情况，建立了芦苇、木耳、元蘑、苹果、板栗、黑白瓜子、蜜蜂、家兔等十七种副业产品基地共三百多处。这些基地，将不仅提供大量商品，还担负出良种、出技术、出经验、出人材的任务。
    这些基地是从去年以来陆续建立的，所经营的副业一般是当地资源比较丰富，群众有生产习惯，销路有保证的项目，也有一些是人工栽植和饲养，但有广阔发展前途的新项目。去年，省有关部门在舒兰县凤凰公社发现适合编席的优良芦苇，便划为基地，加强管理，当年就向省内三十个县供应了大量苇根，进行繁殖。浑江市从一九五二年就开始种党参，但到一九六四年只在二十个生产大队培植了三百八十亩，去年建立副业生产基地以后，迅速发展到一百一十个生产大队种植一千三百二十八亩。
    为了迅速促进副业生产的发展，去年培训了八百多名技术员和三千多名农民技术手，基层供销社配备了专职副业生产指导员，加强了副业生产的技术力量。
