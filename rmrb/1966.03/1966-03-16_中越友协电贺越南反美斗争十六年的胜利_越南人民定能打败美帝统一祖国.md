    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th. The Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association stated today in a telegram to the Vietnam-China Friendship Association that it firmly believes that the heroic Vietnamese people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, will certainly be able to thoroughly defeat the aggression of American imperialism and realize the great cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the motherland.
    The Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association sent the telegram to the Vietnam-China Friendship Association for the sixteenth anniversary of the Vietnam National Anti-American Struggle Day on March 19th and the "Week of Supporting the Vietnamese People."
    In its telegram, the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association praised the heroic Vietnamese people for their steadfast, unyielding, and heroic struggle against American imperialism over the past sixteen years, achieving brilliant victories. The telegram pointed out that these victories are also a tremendous support and encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world.
    The telegram exposed the new tricks of American imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam while playing "peace talk" tricks. The telegram said that some lackeys who are eager to serve American imperialism are also running around, attempting to extricate American imperialism from its predicament and create another "Munich" that betrays the Vietnamese people. The telegram said, however, that the schemes and tricks of American imperialism cannot deceive anyone. The American so-called "peace talk" conspiracy is incompatible with the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. The Vietnamese people have repeatedly declared that no matter how much sacrifice and hardship they must endure, they are determined to fight to the end and completely shatter the barbaric aggression of American imperialism.
    In its telegram, the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association reiterated the Chinese people's firm support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle to resist America and save the nation. The telegram said that the Chinese people have made all preparations and are determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people in the great cause of the Vietnamese people fighting against American aggression and realizing the unification of their motherland, and in the cause of defending peace in Indochina and Asia, until the aggression of American imperialism is completely defeated.

    中越友协电贺越南反美斗争十六年的胜利
    越南人民定能打败美帝统一祖国
    新华社十五日讯　中越友好协会今天在致越中友好协会的一份电报中表示坚信，有着光荣革命传统的英雄的越南人民，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，一是能够彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略，实现解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的大业。
    中越友协是为三月十九日越南全国反美斗争日十六周年和“声援越南人民周”致电越中友协的。
    中越友协在电报中赞扬了英雄的越南人民十六年来同美帝国主义进行了坚强不屈、英勇卓绝的斗争，取得了辉煌的胜利。电报指出，这些胜利同时也是对全世界革命人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。
    电报中揭露了美帝国主义一方面扩大侵越战争，一方面玩弄“和谈”骗局的新花招。电报说，一些热心为美帝国主义效劳的走卒，也在到处奔走，企图为美帝国主义解围，制造出卖越南人民的另一次“慕尼黑”。电报说，但是，美帝国主义的阴谋把戏是骗不了人的，美国的所谓“和谈”阴谋同越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明水火不能相容。越南人民已经反复宣告，不管还要付出多少牺牲，经历多少艰苦，他们决心战斗到底，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的野蛮侵略。
    中越友协在电报中重申中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。电报说，中国人民已经作好了一切准备，决心在越南人民抗击美国侵略、实现祖国统一的伟大事业中，在保卫印度支那和亚洲和平的事业中，同越南人民共同斗争，直到彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略。
