    Bikini Incident

    The "Bikini Incident" occurred on March 1, 1954. This was a serious crime in which American imperialism used nuclear weapons to kill the Japanese people once again, after the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    At that time, the United States, disregarding the protests of peace-loving people all over the world, brazenly conducted hydrogen bomb tests near Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the mid-Pacific. Japanese fishing boats were fishing on the high seas at the time and were harmed by the radioactive dust emitted during the American hydrogen bomb explosion. Twenty-three crew members were injured, and radio operator Aikichi Kuboyama died of his injuries on September 23 of that year. For twelve years, the Japanese people have held activities every year on this day, March 1—the day the "Bikini Incident" occurred—to oppose the aggressive and nuclear war policies of American imperialism.

    比基尼事件
    “比基尼事件”发生在一九五四年三月一日，这是美帝国主义在广岛和长崎投掷原子弹后，又一次用原子武器杀害日本人民的严重罪行。
    当时，美国不顾全世界爱好和平人民的抗议，悍然在中太平洋上的马绍尔群岛的比基尼岛附近进行氢弹试验。日本渔船这时正在公海上捕鱼，遭到了美国氢弹爆炸时发出的放射性微尘的伤害，船员二十三人受伤，其中无线电报务员久保山爱吉于当年九月二十三日不治身死。十二年来，日本人民每年都要在“比基尼事件”发生的这一天——三月一日——举办活动，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和核战争政策。
