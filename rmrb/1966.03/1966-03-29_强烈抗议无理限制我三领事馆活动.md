    Note from Our Embassy to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    Strongly Protests Against Unreasonable Restrictions on the Activities of Our Three Consulates
    Solemnly Points Out: This is a crude violation of the privileges of consular institutions, a blatant trampling on international law, and the creation of extraordinary obstacles in relations between the two countries
    Authorized to Declare: Our consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan are temporarily closed, and consular services will be temporarily handled by our Consulate General in Jakarta
    Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch  The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on the 26th, stating that due to repeated attacks and sabotage by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against our consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan, and unreasonable restrictions on the normal business activities of the consulates, it is impossible to carry out normal work. As of the 26th, the above-mentioned three consulates will be temporarily closed, and their consular business will be temporarily handled by the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta.
    The note requested that the Indonesian government take measures to lift all unreasonable restrictions on the above-mentioned three consulates and effectively guarantee the safety of consular personnel so that they can return to perform their duties.
    The full text of the note is as follows: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and hereby states the following regarding the serious infringement of consular privileges and consular business activities of the Chinese consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan:
    Since February 1966, the three Chinese consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan have successively received notices from local people in power restricting the activities of the consulates, followed by many restrictions. These restrictions include the following: requiring Chinese consuls to obtain approval from the military authorities and obtain a pass to leave the city or go to other places on official business. The military authorities in Sumatra also stipulated that Chinese consuls must notify the Second Military Region Command when leaving the consulate; the military authorities in Banjarmasin even stipulated that Chinese consuls and consular staff must report to the military security authorities every time they go out, even when contacting government authorities for official business or going to the market to buy goods. When a Chinese consul went to the airport to see off his wife, he had to report to the military authorities and obtain a pass before he could proceed. In a notice to the Chinese consul in Medan, the Inter-Regional Commander of the Sumatra Defense Area blatantly proposed "to station a military officer in the consul's residence and office to monitor and register every visitor"; the local authorities in Banjarmasin dispatched military police to set up a sentry post near the Chinese consulate, interrogating, registering, and even searching every overseas Chinese who went to the consulate to discuss matters.
    It must be solemnly pointed out that the Indonesian government and relevant local authorities bear the unshirkable responsibility for protecting the safety of Chinese consulates and their personnel, but they must not use "protection" as an excuse to take various unreasonable restrictive measures. The above-mentioned restrictions on the three Chinese consulates crudely violate the privileges of consular institutions and seriously interfere with the normal business activities of the consulates. This is a blatant trampling on international law and international practice, rare in international relations, and creates extraordinary obstacles in relations between China and Indonesia. The Chinese Embassy hereby lodges a strong protest to the Indonesian government.
    In view of the fact that the three Chinese consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan have been repeatedly attacked and sabotaged by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, the safety of Chinese consuls and consular staff has been seriously threatened, and the normal business activities of the consulates have been unreasonably restricted, and consular privileges have been crudely violated, making it impossible for the above-mentioned three consulates to carry out normal work. The Chinese Embassy is authorized to declare that the Chinese consulates in Banjarmasin, Makassar, and Medan will be temporarily closed from today, and the consuls and consular staff are ordered to withdraw to Jakarta. The consular business in the consular districts of the above-mentioned three consulates will be temporarily handled by the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta. The Embassy requests the Indonesian government to take measures to lift all unreasonable restrictions on the above-mentioned three consulates and effectively guarantee the safety of the consulates and their personnel so that the personnel of the three consulates can return to the consulates to perform their duties. During the temporary departure of the personnel of the three consulates, the houses and property of the three consulates will be guarded by designated staff, and the Embassy requests the Indonesian government to notify the relevant local authorities to provide protection.
    With the highest respect.
                  Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia

专栏：

    我国大使馆照会印度尼西亚外交部
    强烈抗议无理限制我三领事馆活动
    严正指出：这是粗暴地侵犯领事机构的特权，公然践踏国际公法，并在两国关系中制造了异乎寻常的障碍
    受权申明：我驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰三领事馆暂时停止办公，领事业务暂由我驻雅加达总领事馆负责处理
    新华社二十八日讯  中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十六日照会印度尼西亚共和国外交部，由于中国驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰三领事馆一再遭到印度尼西亚右派反动势力的袭击和破坏，领事馆的正常业务活动又受到无理限制，以致无法进行正常工作。从二十六日起，上述三领事馆暂时停止办公，它们的领事业务，暂由中国驻雅加达总领事馆负责处理。
    照会要求印度尼西亚政府采取措施，取消对上述三领事馆的各种无理限制，并切实保障领事馆人员的安全，以便他们能够返回执行他们的职务。
    照会全文如下：印度尼西亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意，并就中国驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰领事馆的领事特权和领事业务活动受到严重侵犯的情况，申述如下：
    自一九六六年二月以来，中国驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰三领事馆，先后接到地方两项人民命令掌权者限制领事馆活动的通告，随后即遭到许多限制，这些限制包含以下的内容：规定中国领事离开市区或因公去外地均须得到军事当局的批准，领取通行证。苏门答腊的军事当局还规定中国领事离馆出门必须通知第二军区司令；马辰军事当局甚至规定中国领事和领事馆人员每次出门均须报告军事治安当局，即使向政府当局接洽公务，去市场购买物品亦不例外，中国领事去机场为其夫人送行，亦须报告军事当局，领取通行证，始能成行。苏门答腊防御区际司令在给中国驻棉兰领事的通知书中，竟公然提出“将安置一名军官在领事馆住所和办公室，以便监视和登记每一位来访者”；马辰地方当局派出军警在中国领事馆近邻设立哨站，对每一位去领事馆接谈事务的华侨，进行盘查、登记，甚至搜身。
    必须郑重指出：印度尼西亚政府和有关地方当局，对中国领事馆及其人员的安全负有不可推卸的保护责任，但决不能借口“保护”，采取无理限制的种种措施。上述对三个中国领事馆的各种限制，粗暴地侵犯了领事机构的特权，严重地干涉了领事馆的正常业务活动，这是对国际公法和国际惯例的公然践踏，是国际关系中所罕见的，并且在中国和印度尼西亚两国关系中制造了异乎寻常的障碍。对此，中国大使馆特向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈抗议。
    鉴于中国驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰三领事馆一再遭到印度尼西亚右派反动势力的袭击和破坏，中国领事和领事馆工作人员的安全受到了严重威胁，而领事馆的正常业务活动又受到无理限制，领事特权也受到粗暴侵犯，以致上述三领事馆无法进行正常工作。中国大使馆特受权申明：中国驻马辰、望加锡和棉兰三领事馆，自即日起暂时停止办公，领事和领事馆工作人员奉命撤至雅加达，上述三领事馆领区的领事业务，暂由中国驻雅加达总领事馆负责处理。大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府采取措施，取消对上述三领事馆的各种无理限制，并切实保障领事馆及其人员的安全，以便该三领事馆人员能够返馆执行其职务。在上述三领事馆人员暂时离开领事馆期间，三领事馆的房屋、财产即由指定的工作人员看管，大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府通知有关地方当局给予保护。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                  中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆
                      一九六六年三月二十六日于雅加达
