    Spreading Wings with Revolutionary Enthusiasm
    ——An Account of Female Flight Commander Chen Zhiying
    On February 15th, thick clouds hung low over an air force airfield of the People's Liberation Army, the surrounding scenery obscured by the pervasive mist. At that moment, a plane returning from a long-distance flight requested landing.
    A series of roaring engine sounds came from the sky. People couldn't help but focus their attention on the robust female commander. Because, in such weather, landing an aircraft requires the commander to issue each instruction to the air quickly, decisively, and accurately. Any hesitation or negligence could lead to serious consequences.
    The plane was descending towards the airport runway. People only saw the fuselage when the plane was about one hundred meters from the ground. The plane appearing so low made everyone's heart suddenly tense. But the female commander was so calm. She only said in an extremely calm tone: "Steady, pull up a little, pull up a little more, good!" The plane then aligned with the runway and landed lightly and smoothly. At this time, people at the airport breathed a sigh of relief and praised, "Well commanded!"
    This calm and decisive flight commander is Chen Zhiying, the first female flight commander of New China and the deputy chief of staff of an air force regiment.
    Chen Zhiying was born into an ordinary farmer's family and only had seven years of schooling. Nurtured by the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, she led the first group of female aviators of New China across Tiananmen Square fourteen years ago on "March 8th" International Women's Day, receiving the review of the Party and the people. Over the past ten years, she has performed countless flight missions, day and night, in wind and rain. Each time, she has excellently completed the tasks assigned to her by the Party and the people. After the Party transferred her to leadership work, she quickly became an excellent flight commander. In the countless flights she has commanded over the years, no accidents have occurred, and she has trained batches of male and female pilots for the country.
    The organizational work and technical requirements of commanding flight are quite complex. What does Chen Zhiying rely on to do her commander work well? She said: "Rely on politics. No matter how complex the aircraft is, it is operated by people. We command people, not aircraft. As long as we arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, grasp people's living thoughts, any complex aircraft will obey orders."
    Once, Chen Zhiying served as the commander for night flight training. Yu Yaqin, a female pilot who had not flown at night, saw others flying for a while and said: "I think, this subject can be flown solo after eight takeoffs and landings!" This sentence was spoken casually, but Chen Zhiying did not let it easily slip past her ears. She understood that Yu Yaqin was smart and had mastered the technology quickly. Precisely because of this, she often saw some new subjects as too simple. Without overcoming this kind of thinking, it would hinder her from advancing more steadily in technology. She seized this ideological bud, and during the critique, she gave everyone a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The problem of knowledge is a scientific problem, and there can be no hypocrisy or pride..." She asked everyone to take this passage as the guiding ideology of this training, link it to themselves, conduct self-examinations, and organize everyone to analyze and discuss the requirements of the new subject, recognize its difficulties, and treat it correctly. This critique vividly educated Yu Yaqin and other pilots, making them treat the new subject more steadily and meticulously in training, ensuring the quality of training. The first solo flight was well received by the superiors.
    In commanding flight, Chen Zhiying's requirements for the pilots are strict, but they are also full of deep class feelings. She can empathize with the pilots, patiently helping them overcome ideological and technical difficulties. Female pilot Zhang Zhenghui was a competitive girl. Because her technical progress was relatively slow, seeing that her female companions had all flown solo one by one, she was very anxious and lost confidence in flying. Chen Zhiying thought that she must not let her class sister stop flying easily, and she must help her fly. She asked Zhang Zhenghui to move in and live with her, often talking to her, telling her about the scene when Chairman Mao received the first group of female pilots, the significance of the Party training female pilots, and also told her about an unforgettable incident. Chen Zhiying said to Zhang Zhenghui: "A girl from a capitalist country once wrote me a letter saying that she loved flying very much, but she could not afford the huge tuition fees, and her wish could not be realized. She was very envious of us for having such a country and social system that allows women's ideals and talents to be fully developed. Think about it, how much happier we are than this girl! What reason do we have to lose confidence. When encountering difficulties, we must think more about the expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao for us. We must fly out, not only for Chinese women, but also to point out a path of struggle for women in the world!"
    With Chen Zhiying's help, Zhang Zhenghui strengthened her confidence in flying. Chen Zhiying also helped her technically. With Chen Zhiying's patient help, Zhang Zhenghui made rapid progress, finally mastered the operating skills, and flew alone into the blue sky of the motherland.
    As a commander, Chen Zhiying never relied on her position as a leading cadre to consider herself brilliant or to be self-righteous. She always followed Chairman Mao's instruction to be the student of the masses before being the teacher of the masses. When she arranges work and formulates plans, she conducts thorough investigation and research in advance, solicits the opinions of the masses, and anticipates solutions to problems that may occur during implementation. She is an "all-weather" pilot and a leading cadre, but when flying, whether she is flying with old pilots or new pilots, she very humbly listens to their opinions.
    Chen Zhiying is thirty-seven years old this year and has been flying in the skies of the motherland for fifteen years. Today, she is still flying. She often says: "For us women of New China, whether to fly or not, and how many years to fly, this is not an individual issue, it is closely linked to the cause of the Party. We must strive to fly for a longer period of time." In order to realize this wish, she strives to study Chairman Mao's works, arm her mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and keep her revolutionary youth forever. She persists in physical exercise for a long time. For the aviation cause of the great motherland, she is spreading her wings with revolutionary enthusiasm.

    满怀革命豪情展翅飞翔
    ——记女飞行指挥员陈志英
    二月十五日，人民解放军空军某飞机场上空，浓云低垂，四周的景物，都隐没在弥漫的云雾中。就在这时，一架远航归来的飞机要求着陆。
    一阵阵隆隆的马达声从天上传来，人们情不自禁地把目光都集中到那位身材魁梧的女指挥员身上。因为，飞机在这样天气降落，要求指挥员向空中下达的每个口令，都应当迅速果断，准确无误，任何犹豫、疏忽，都会造成严重后果。
    飞机在向机场跑道下滑了，直到飞机离地面一百米左右，人们才见到机身。飞机这样低才出现，使得大家的心骤然紧张。但这位女指挥员是那样镇定，她只用极平和的语调说了句：“沉着，拉一点，再拉一点，好！”飞机就对准跑道，轻捷而平稳地着陆了。这时机场上的人们才轻舒了一口气，称赞道：“指挥得好！”
    这位镇定、果敢的飞行指挥员，就是新中国的第一个女飞行指挥员、空军某团副参谋长陈志英。
    陈志英出生在一个普通农民的家庭，只念过七年书。在毛泽东思想阳光的哺育下，她在十四年前的“三八”节，曾率领新中国第一批女航空员飞过天安门，接受党和人民的检阅。十多年来，她执行过无数次的飞行任务，不论白天夜晚，风里雨里，每一次，她都出色地完成了党和人民交给她的任务。党调她做了领导工作以后，她又很快成了一个出色的飞行指挥员。几年来，在她指挥过的无数次飞行中，从未发生过事故，为国家训练出了一批又一批的男女飞行员。
    指挥飞行的组织工作和技术要求是相当复杂的。陈志英靠什么做好指挥员工作的？她说：“靠政治。不管飞机多么复杂，它都是人操纵的。我们指挥的是人，不是飞机。只要用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，抓好人的活思想，多么复杂的飞机就都听使唤了。”
    有次，陈志英担任夜间飞行训练的指挥员。没有飞过夜航的女飞行员俞亚琴，看见别人飞了一阵以后，就说：“我看，这个课目有八个起落就可以放单飞了！”这句话是随口说出的，可陈志英却没有让它轻易从耳边滑过。她了解，俞亚琴人聪明，技术掌握得也较快，正是这样，她时常把一些新课目看得太简单。不克服这种思想，就会阻碍她在技术上更踏实地前进。她抓住这个思想苗头，在讲评时就给大家讲了一段毛主席的语录：“知识的问题是一个科学问题，来不得半点的虚伪和骄傲……”要大家把这段话作为这次训练的指导思想，联系自己，对照检查，并且组织大家分析讨论新课目的要求，认识它的难处，正确对待。这个讲评，生动地教育了俞亚琴和其他飞行员，使她们在训练中更加踏实细致地对待新课目，保证了训练质量，第一次放单飞就得到上级的好评。
    在指挥飞行中，陈志英对飞行员们的要求是严格的，但又是充满深厚阶级感情的。她能设身处地地为飞行员们着想，耐心地帮助飞行员们克服思想上和技术上的困难。女飞行员张正辉是个要强的姑娘。由于技术进步比较慢，看见别的女伴都一个个放单飞了，她心里非常着急，失去了飞出来的信心。陈志英想，决不能让自己的阶级姊妹轻易停飞，一定要帮助她飞出来。她叫张正辉搬来和自己住在一起，经常跟她谈心，讲毛主席接见第一批女飞行员时的情景，讲党培养女飞行员的意义，还讲了自己难忘的一件事。陈志英对张正辉说：“一个资本主义国家的姑娘曾给我来过一封信，说她很热爱飞行，可就是交不起巨额的学费，愿望无法实现。她非常羡慕我们有这样一个使妇女理想和才能充分发挥的国家和社会制度。你想，比起这个姑娘我们是多幸福！我们有什么理由丧失信心。遇到困难要多想想党和毛主席对我们的期望，我们一定要飞出来，这不仅是为了中国妇女，也是为了给世界妇女指出一条斗争道路！”
    张正辉在陈志英帮助下增强了飞出来的信心。陈志英又在技术上帮助她，在陈志英的耐心帮助下，张正辉进步很快，终于掌握了操作要领，单独驾着飞机飞上了祖国的蓝天。
    作为一个指挥员，陈志英从不因为自己是领导干部而自恃高明，自以为是。她总是照着毛主席提出的要做群众的先生，就要先做群众的学生这个指示去做。她安排工作、制订计划的时候，事先都要进行周密的调查研究，征求群众意见，对执行中可能发生的问题，都要设想出解决的方案。她是“全天候”飞行员，又是领导干部，但是飞行时，不论是和老飞行员或新飞行员同机，她都非常虚心地听取他们的意见。
    陈志英今年已经三十七岁了，在祖国的天空已经飞行了十五年，今天仍然在飞。她常说：“我们新中国的妇女，飞或者不飞，飞多少年，这不是一个个人的问题，它同党的事业紧密地联系在一起。我们一定要争取飞更长的年限。为了实现这个愿望，她努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，使自己永葆革命青春。她长期坚持体育锻炼，为了伟大祖国的航空事业，她正满怀革命豪情展翅飞翔。
