    Serving the Struggle for Production, Serving Scientific Experimentation
    Situ Huimin
    In the past two years, various fields of cultural and artistic work, and scientific and technological work in our country have seen many new figures, new ideas, and new achievements. People are gradually realizing that cultural, artistic, scientific, and technological work must highlight politics, with politics as the commander, driving all aspects of work. People also realize that cultural, artistic, scientific, and technological work must serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and especially serve the five hundred million peasants who are most urgently in need of cultural and artistic life and scientific and technological knowledge. Under the guidance of this ideological policy, our science education film workers have also made great efforts and achieved considerable success and experience in the past year. They went down to the countryside and factories, determined to learn from the masses for a long time and work for the masses, thereby understanding the likes and needs of the masses, and making progress in terms of ideological content and even expressive forms of science education films. The number of science education films has greatly increased, and the scope of film subjects has also expanded, more closely meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the development of advanced science and technology. More than half of the science education films produced in 1965 explained agricultural science and technology knowledge, disseminating and exchanging advanced experiences in agricultural technology. The subjects of industrial technology, applied science, and even auxiliary teaching have also increased.
    Science education films have become a powerful tool for serving the struggle for production and scientific experimentation. Under this new situation, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the broad film audience, have also gained new understanding and new views of science education films. They have already seen that before the cultural revolution, a considerable part of the science education films belonged to those that only sought good looks, but did not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or production and construction; some were boring and uninteresting; some films were even difficult to watch and useless. Now, because science education film workers have gone deep into life, become familiar with or gradually familiar with the hobbies and needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and produced many good films, the broad masses can understand them, watch them well, and meet the current urgent needs. The masses deeply feel that watching science education films can not only enrich cultural life, but also increase knowledge, solve many problems encountered in production and work, and promote the development of industry, agriculture, and other socialist construction. For example, the films "Dazhai Field," "Transforming Mountain Pits into Cold Waterlogged Fields," "Farmland Shelterbelts," "Chemical Herbicides," "Spring Corn Fertilization and Water Management," and "Combination Fixtures" produced by the Beijing Science Education Film Studio last year; the films "Late Japonica Rice Nongken No. 58," "Prevention and Control of Broad Bean Weevils and Pea Weevils," "Water Hammer Pump," "Metal Spraying," "Debris Flow," and the "Cixi Cotton Production Technology Experience" series produced by the Shanghai Science Education Film Studio; the films "Clever Management of 'Golden' Water" and "Cotton Patch Bud Replanting" produced by the Agricultural Film Studio; the films "Branched Large Red Spike Sorghum" and "Soybean Seed Fields" produced by the Changchun Film Studio; the films "Ramie Seedling Breeding" and "Early Rice Short-Stemmed Good Varieties" produced by the Pearl River Film Studio; and the science education films "Horizontal Terraces" and "Water Diversion and Sand Control," a series of soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River produced by the Xi'an Film Studio, have all been warmly welcomed by the broad masses.
    From our past achievements and experience, the development of science education films, like other undertakings, will inevitably achieve nothing in the socialist era if they do not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not serve socialism, do not highlight politics, and do not take Mao Zedong Thought as the commander; only by putting the direction on the correct track of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism, will we gain the support of the broad masses of people, will our cause have broad prospects, and will we play a role in promoting the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We can also see that although our cause is still very young, and we still lack experience in film production and creation, thanks to the attention of the leadership, the love of the masses, and the efforts of science education film workers, we will continue to improve and develop; constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our thinking and working methods; constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress in our work. If we persevere seriously, we will be able to establish a gradually perfect new art form that is loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers and applied by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Although science education films have made great progress and improvements in terms of quantity, subject scope, film content, and artistic form in the recent period, due to the continuous and in-depth development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the continuous emergence of new scientific and technological achievements, science education films are required to closely cooperate with the needs of scientific and technological development, and to exchange and disseminate new achievements and new experiences in science and technology. We can expect that in the coming period, my country's science education film industry will inevitably have greater and more rapid development.
    In the past two or three years, various provinces and cities have held many science education film exhibitions, or organized screenings of science education films for relevant industries. The audience of science education films is increasing year by year, which is an excellent situation. It is hoped that science education film workers and relevant leading departments will strengthen cooperation, take advantage of the victory to advance, and enable science education films to better serve the struggle for production and scientific experimentation.

    为生产斗争服务　为科学实验服务
    司徒慧敏
    近两年来，我国文化艺术工作、科学技术工作的各个领域，都出现了很多新的人物、新的思想和新的成果。人们逐渐认识到，文化、艺术、科学技术工作，必须突出政治，以政治为统帅，带动各方面的工作。人们也认识到，文化、艺术、科学技术工作，必须为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为广大工农兵群众服务，特别要为最迫切需要文化艺术生活和科学技术知识的五亿农民服务。我们的科学教育电影工作者，在这种思想方针指引下，最近一年来，也作了很大的努力，并取得了较大的成绩与经验。他们下乡下厂，决心长期地向群众学习，为群众工作，从而了解群众的喜好与需要，使科学教育电影，从思想内容以至于表现形式等方面都有了进步。科学教育电影的数量大大增加，影片的题材范围也有所扩大，更密切地适应工农业生产和先进科学技术发展的需要。一九六五年制作的科学教育电影中有一半以上的题材，是阐明农业科学技术知识，传播和交流农业技术先进经验的。工业技术和应用科学以至辅助教学的题材也增加了。
    科学教育电影，已经成为为生产斗争和为科学实验服务的有力工具。在这个新形势下，工农兵群众和广大电影观众，对于科学教育电影也有了新的认识和新的看法。他们已经看到，在文化革命以前，科学教育电影中，有相当一部分是属于只求好看，不为工农兵，不为生产建设服务的；也有一些是令人感到枯燥乏味的；有一些影片甚至看也看不好，用也用不上。现在，由于科学教育电影工作者深入生活，熟悉了或者逐渐熟悉了工农兵群众的爱好和需要，制作了许多好影片，使广大群众看得懂，看得好，能够满足当前的急迫需要。群众深深感到，看了科学教育电影，既能丰富文化生活，又能增长知识，解决在生产和工作中遇到的许多问题，促进工农业和其他社会主义建设的发展。如：去年北京科学教育电影制片厂摄制的《大寨田》、《改造山坑冷浸田》、《农田防护林》、《化学除草剂》、《春玉米肥水管理》、《组合夹具》；上海科学教育电影制片厂摄制的《晚粳稻农垦58号》、《防治蚕豆象与豌豆象》、《水锤泵》、《金属喷涂》、《泥石流》、《慈溪棉花生产技术经验》组片；农业电影制片厂摄制的《巧管“千金”水》和《棉花贴芽补种》；长春电影制片厂摄制的《分枝大红穗高粱》和《大豆种子田》；珠江电影制片厂摄制的《苎麻种子育苗》和《早稻矮秆良种》；西安电影制片厂摄制的黄河中游水土保持组片《水平梯田》和《引水拉沙》等科学教育影片，都获得了广大群众热烈欢迎。
    从我们过去所获得的成绩和经验看来，科学教育电影的发展，也如同其他各种事业一样，在社会主义时代，如果不为工农兵服务，不为社会主义服务，不突出政治，不以毛泽东思想挂帅，必然是一事无成；只有把方向摆到为工农兵、为社会主义这条正确的轨道上来，才会得到广大人民群众的拥护，我们的事业也才有广阔的前途，并在促进社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥作用。我们也可以看到，尽管我们的事业还很年轻，在制片和创作工作中还缺乏经验，但由于领导的重视，群众的喜爱，加上科学教育电影工作者的努力，就会不断地改进和提高；不断地以毛泽东思想来改造我们的思想和工作方法：不断地总结经验，在工作中有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。我们认真坚持下去，一定能够建立逐渐完美的、为工农兵群众所喜爱、为工农兵所应用的新的艺术形式。
    尽管最近一个时期，科学教育电影无论是数量、题材范围、影片的内容和艺术形式都有了很大的发展与提高，但由于社会主义革命和社会主义建设不断深入发展，新的科学技术成就不断出现，这就要求科学教育电影，紧紧地配合着科学技术发展的需要，交流和传播科学技术的新的成就和新的经验。我们可以预期：在今后一个时期，我国科学教育电影事业必然会有更大、更迅速的发展。
    最近二、三年来，各省市已经多次举办科学教育电影展览，或对有关行业组织科学教育电影的放映活动，科学教育电影的观众一年年在增加，这是一个极好的形势。希望科学教育电影工作者和各有关领导部门，加强合作，乘胜前进，使科学教育电影能够更好地为生产斗争服务，为科学实验服务。
