    祝天乔  配诗
    浙江镇海县三山大队贫农出身的生产队副队长翁光星，一家三代当保健员，积极为社员服务。“卫生员之家”木刻组画描绘的就是这个平凡而感人的故事。一翁光星是卫生员，一颗红心亮闪闪，培养妻女当助手，他把医术耐心传。二劳动归来手不闲，打针治病为社员。妈妈心里有意见：不知劳累为哪般？光星他把妈妈劝：看看现在想从前，若非解放见大阳，农民生病有谁管？四有个孩童太贪玩，跌破头皮血斑斑，儿媳不在难救急，婆婆学把绷带缠。五孩童伤好笑声喧，他妈一见乐开颜，亲到翁家去致谢，感谢白发卫生员。六趁热打铁铁更坚，支书上门把话谈，表扬老人好风格，革命道理讲一番。七思想一通劲更添，老人也当卫生员，祖孙三代心一条，搞好保健为生产。
