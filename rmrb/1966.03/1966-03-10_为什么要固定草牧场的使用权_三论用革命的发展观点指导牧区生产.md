    Party policy is the lifeblood of the Party. Any work we undertake requires correct policies. In pastoral production and grassland construction, correct policies are equally essential. The vast pastoral and semi-agricultural areas of our country are vigorously engaged in grassland construction. To do this work well, we must first, in accordance with the principles of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, and based on the actual conditions of each region, fix clearly and appropriately the right to long-term use of all collectively owned grassland pastures to the people's communes, production teams, state-owned enterprises, and institutions. This is an important prerequisite for carrying out grassland construction work and an important policy of the Party.
    Grassland, like arable land, is an important means of production. Grassland construction relies on highlighting politics, raising the political consciousness of the herders, and on the correct implementation of the Party's policies, mobilizing the revolutionary and construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of herders. Our Party has always attached importance to grassland construction. In order to strengthen the protection, management, utilization, and construction of grasslands, the Party has formulated a series of policies related to grassland work. For example, in the early days of liberation, the Party formulated a policy to abolish feudal privileges in the occupation of grassland pastures and implement the rational use of grassland pastures; later, in response to the problems existing in some semi-agricultural and pastoral areas and pastoral areas, it proposed a policy to prohibit land reclamation and protect pastures; in the relevant policy regulations of the people's communes in pastoral areas, it also proposed a policy to delineate the scope and boundaries of grassland pasture use, and so on. These policies, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the ethnic characteristics, regional characteristics, and production characteristics of the pastoral areas, were proposed to solve the urgent problems that needed to be solved at the time, and played a huge role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the herders and promoting the great development of animal husbandry production.
    After the people's communes were established, with the continuous development of animal husbandry production, grassland pastures were utilized on a larger scale, and the further construction of natural grasslands became increasingly urgent. To smoothly build grasslands, it is necessary to fix the right to use grassland pastures. This is the urgent demand of the broad masses of herders. Only when the right to use grassland pastures is clearly fixed can each production unit have the right to manage and use the fixed grassland pasture area, as well as the responsibility to protect, cultivate, and construct it. In this way, it is possible to establish a clear responsibility system and responsibility sections, so that the enthusiasm of the masses to build grasslands can be fully utilized, and the idea of long-term construction can be established, in order to use rationally and build well. The practical experience of many regions has proven that fixing the right to use grassland pastures is conducive to strengthening ethnic unity; conducive to changing backward management methods and management habits; conducive to establishing a clear responsibility system, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses to protect, utilize, and build grasslands, carrying out grassland construction faster, better, and more economically, and promoting greater development of animal husbandry production.
    "Anyway, the grassland is so big, it doesn't matter whether it is fixed or not." This idea is completely wrong. Fixing the right to use grassland pastures is primarily aimed at this kind of unplanned random grazing, which lacks a long-term construction perspective. To build a socialist animal husbandry economy, we must rationally utilize grasslands and vigorously build grasslands. Unplanned random grazing makes rational utilization impossible, and the phenomenon of only caring about the present and not the future is difficult to avoid. It is difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for construction and comprehensively carry out grassland construction. In Xilingaole Commune, Alxa Left Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the situation changed drastically before and after fixing the right to use grassland pastures: before fixing the right to use grassland pastures, the boundaries between inside and outside were unclear, random grazing occurred at the junctions, and the grassland pasture was over-utilized and gradually degraded. After fixing the right to use grassland pastures and strengthening ideological and political work, the four boundaries were clear, herders no longer grazed beyond the boundaries, cooperation was strengthened, unity was enhanced, the grassland was protected, and the potential of the existing grassland was fully tapped; they planned to plant grass, plant trees, and seal off beaches to cultivate grass, and then formulated a five-year grassland construction plan. This fact fully proves that the policy of fixing the right to use grassland pastures is in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of herders and has been supported by the broad masses of herders.
    "Fixing the right to use grassland pastures will restrict grazing and affect production." On the surface, fixing the right to use grassland pastures will restrict grazing to some extent, while unplanned grazing may seem unrestricted, but the utilization rate of grassland pastures will inevitably decrease, the grassland will inevitably be damaged, and in the end, animal husbandry production will truly be greatly restricted. From this point of view, a small range of restrictions is precisely for a larger range of "freedom." If everyone grazes within a fixed area, it can promote the planned and rational utilization of grassland pastures, more effectively carry out grassland construction, and animal husbandry production can achieve continuous and greater development. Of course, after fixing the right to use grassland pastures, cooperation is not unnecessary. In the event of natural disasters or other special circumstances, necessary adjustments can be made in accordance with the principles of overall planning, voluntary and mutual benefit. At the same time, the state can also retain and control a part of the mobile grassland pastures to solve the needs of disaster resistance and famine preparedness.
    Fixing the right to use grassland pastures is not for the sake of fixing; the fundamental purpose is to better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of herders to build grasslands and carry out grassland construction. Therefore, while fixing the right to use grassland pastures, we should mobilize the masses to formulate grassland construction plans in accordance with local conditions, taking the people's commune or production team as the unit, and implement the policy of fixing the right to use grassland pastures in grassland construction.
    Fixing the right to use grassland pastures is closely related to the socialist construction of pastoral areas, the consolidation of the collective economy of the people's communes, and the vital interests of the broad masses of herders. It is a work with strong policy and a wide range of implications. To do this work well, we must first strengthen the leadership of the Party and earnestly highlight politics. We must not be afraid of trouble, conduct thorough and meticulous investigations and studies, and earnestly solve various ideological problems; we must educate the broad masses of herders, especially grassroots cadres, to establish an overall concept of starting from the overall situation, starting from production, and starting from unity. Through fixed work, we must achieve benefits for unity, benefits for production, benefits for management, and benefits for mutual assistance and mutual support. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the front lines, do it themselves, discover problems in a timely manner, and summarize experiences. In practical work, we must make good use of the Party's mass line working methods, hand over the policy of fixing the right to use grassland pastures to the masses, so that the Party's policy becomes the conscious action of the masses, consciously implemented and consciously executed.

    为什么要固定草牧场的使用权
    ——三论用革命的发展观点指导牧区生产
    党的政策是党的生命。我们进行任何一项工作，都需要有正确的政策。在牧区生产和草原建设中，同样必须有正确的政策。我国广大牧区和半农半牧区，正在大力进行草原建设。要做好这项工作，首先要把全民所有的草牧场，按照统筹安排、全面规划的原则，根据各个地区的实际情况，因地制宜地、明确地固定给人民公社、生产队、国营企业、事业单位长期使用。这是开展草原建设工作的一个重要前提，是党的一项重要政策。
    草原，跟耕地一样，是重要的生产资料。草原的建设，要靠突出政治，提高牧民群众的政治觉悟，要靠正确贯彻执行党的政策，调动广大牧民群众的革命和建设的积极性。我们党历来重视草原的建设，为了加强草原的保护、管理、利用和建设的工作，党曾经制定了一系列有关草原工作的政策。比如，在解放初期，党就制定了废除草牧场的封建占有特权，实行合理使用草牧场的政策；之后，又针对一些半农半牧区和牧区所存在的问题，提出了禁止开荒，保护牧场的政策，在牧区人民公社的有关政策规定中，又提出划定草牧场的使用范围和界限的政策，等等。这些政策，都是以毛泽东思想作指导，结合牧区的民族特点、地区特点和生产特点，为着解决当时迫切需要解决的问题而提出的，起了调动牧民群众的积极性，促进畜牧业生产大发展的巨大作用。
    人民公社化以后，随着畜牧业生产的不断发展，草牧场在更大的范围得到了利用，天然草原进一步建设的问题越来越迫切了。要顺利地建设草原，就必须固定草牧场的使用权。这是广大牧民群众的迫切要求。只有草牧场的使用权明确地固定下来了，各个生产单位在所固定的草牧场范围内，既有管理使用之权，又有保护、培育、建设之责。这样，才有可能建立明确的责任制度和责任地段，使群众建设草原的积极性充分发挥出来，树立长期建设的思想，以便合理地使用和很好地建设。许多地区的实践经验证明，固定草牧场的使用权，有利于加强民族团结；有利于改变落后的经营方式和经营习惯；有利于建立明确的责任制，进一步调动广大群众保护、利用、建设草原的积极性，多快好省地开展草原建设，促进畜牧业生产的更大发展。
    “反正草原这么大，固定不固定没关系。”这种想法是十分错误的。固定草牧场使用权，首先就是针对这种无计划地随便放牧，缺乏长远建设观点提出的。我们要建设社会主义的畜牧业经济，必须合理利用草原，大力建设草原，而无计划地随便放牧，就不可能合理利用，只顾眼前、不顾长远的现象就难以避免，就难以调动广大群众的建设积极性，全面开展草原建设。内蒙古自治区阿拉善左旗锡林高勒公社，在固定草牧场使用权的前后，情况发生了极大的变化：固定草牧场使用权以前，内外界限不清，交界处乱放乱牧，草牧场利用过度，逐渐退化。在固定了草牧场的使用权、加强了思想政治工作以后，四界明确，牧民不再越界放牧，加强了协作，增强了团结，保护了草原，充分挖掘了现有草原的潜力；他们有计划地种草、种树、封滩育草，进而制定了五年草原建设规划。这一事实充分证明，固定草牧场使用权的政策，符合广大牧民的根本利益，得到了广大牧民群众的拥护。
    “固定草牧场使用权，放牧要受限制，生产要受影响。”从表面上来看，草牧场的使用权固定了，放牧是要受到一些限制，而无计划地放牧，看起来好象是不受限制，但草牧场的利用率必然降低，草原必然受到损害，最后是使畜牧业生产要真正受到极大限制。由此看来，一个小范围内的限制，正是为了更大范围内的“自由”。如果大家都在固定的范围内放牧，就可以促进草牧场的有计划地合理地利用，更有效地开展草原建设，畜牧业生产就可以获得不断的更大发展。当然，固定草牧场使用权以后，并不是不需要协作了。遇到天灾或其他特殊情况，按照统筹安排、自愿互利的原则，是可以进行必要的调剂的。同时，国家也还可以保留并掌握一部分机动的草牧场，以解决抗灾备荒的需要。
    固定草牧场使用权，并不是为固定而固定，根本的目的是为了更好地调动广大牧民群众建设草原的积极性，开展草原建设。因此，在固定草牧场的同时，应当发动群众，以人民公社或生产队为单位，因地制宜地制定草原建设规划，把固定草牧场使用权的政策落脚到草原建设上去。
    固定草牧场使用权，对于牧区的社会主义建设，对于人民公社集体经济的巩固，对于广大牧民群众的切身利益，都具有非常密切的关系，是一项政策性很强、牵涉面很广的工作。做好这一工作，首先要加强党的领导，认真突出政治。要不怕麻烦，进行周到细致的调查研究，认真解决各种思想认识问题；要教育广大牧民群众，特别是基层干部，树立从全局出发，从生产出发、从团结出发的整体观念，通过固定工作，要做到有利于团结，有利于生产，有利于经营管理，有利于互相协助和互相支援。各级领导干部要深入现场，亲自动手，及时发现问题，总结经验。在实际工作中，要很好地运用党的群众路线的工作方法，把固定草牧场使用权的政策交给群众，使党的政策成为群众的自觉的行动，自觉地贯彻，自觉地执行。
