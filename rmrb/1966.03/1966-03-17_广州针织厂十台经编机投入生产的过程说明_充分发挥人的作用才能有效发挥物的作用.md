    Process Description of Putting Ten Weft Knitting Machines into Production at Guangzhou Knitting Factory
    Fully Utilizing the Role of People is the Only Way to Effectively Utilize the Role of Things
    Around the Spring Festival, a batch of colorful nylon headscarves appeared on the Guangzhou market. This new product immediately attracted many women and quickly sold out. The workers at the Guangzhou Knitting Factory, who produced these nylon headscarves, were happier than anyone else. Their happiness stemmed not only from producing this new product for the first time but also from the fact that the human factor had finally shone brightly, allowing the material factor to finally bear fruit.
    The story goes like this:
    In 1961, the state equipped the Guangzhou Knitting Factory with ten weft knitting machines imported from abroad. These weft knitting machines, used for weaving chemical fibers, represented the "cutting-edge equipment" of textile technology worldwide, with only a few in the entire country. Such excellent machinery and equipment should have played a significant role in production! The factory's leading cadres were overjoyed, treating them like treasures. They instructed workers not to enter the weft knitting workshop casually and not to touch the machines carelessly, fearing they might damage the "foreign treasures."
    Machines are not for display; they are meant to be put into production and produce goods. What was the factory's leadership thinking? They were still focused on the "material" aspect. With weft knitting machines, they needed warping machines; with warping machines, they needed setting machines; with setting machines, they needed modern factories with automatic temperature and humidity control; after the factory was approved and built, they needed to import nylon raw materials. In short, in the minds of the leadership, "the material factor came first." The more they believed in the material factor, the more they felt that the material conditions were inadequate, and the more they reached out for more material conditions. Thus, one year, two years, three years, four years passed, and the weft knitting machines were never formally put into production.
    The higher authorities constantly inquired about the production status of the weft knitting machines. Each time, the factory's leading cadres replied that they were still in the trial production phase. However, after several years of trial production, the quality was never guaranteed, with too many holes. Later, an expert was invited, who discovered that the crux of the quality problem was uneven tension in the single strands of the warping frame. What could be done? The expert suggested importing new warping frames. At this point, the factory's leading cadres became somewhat distraught. How could these "foreign treasures" be so difficult to handle? They would have to import new warping frames again, but how could they say that? Even worse, during trial production, the static eliminator on one of the weft knitting machines broke down, and despite searching everywhere, they couldn't find a way to repair it. Thus, with trial production after trial production, the leading cadres became increasingly discouraged, eventually losing all hope. The initial "treasure" was now regarded as a "burden." They repeatedly requested to have this set of weft knitting machines and supporting equipment transferred out. Some technicians who had returned from Shanghai after training and technicians sent by the higher authorities were also transferred away from the weft knitting workshop to do other work.
    Observe how those who emphasize "the material factor first" and engage in "machine-only theory" ultimately go to their own opposite, even treating good machinery and equipment as "burdens" and unwilling to bear them any longer.
    Were the weft knitting machines a "burden"? Should they be transferred out? During the Socialist Education Movement that began in September of last year, workers at the Guangzhou Knitting Factory studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, rallied their revolutionary spirit, and engaged in a sharp debate with the factory's leading cadres on the above issue. Maintenance worker Liang Luoxian said, "The main reason why the weft knitting machines have not been put into production for a long time is that the factory leadership does not value the human factor, does not trust us workers, and does not rely on us workers. In a word, they don't have us workers in their minds!" Some said, "To be helpless in the face of foreign equipment is to inflate the arrogance of foreigners and deflate our own morale!" Others said, "Treating imported equipment as a burden is an extremely irresponsible act towards state property." Still others said, "The 'burden' is not on the ten weft knitting machines but in the heads of the cadres; what needs to be transferred out is not the machines but the cadres' inaction!" After the debate, the factory's leading cadres were covered in sweat and became much clearer, realizing that "seeing things but not seeing people" had harmed themselves, harmed the machines, and harmed production.
    A three-way combination attack team composed of workers, cadres, and technicians was formed. They immediately dismantled two weft knitting machines and found that there was nothing mysterious inside, but some parts had already rusted, and some were about to corrode. When the veteran workers saw this, they hurried to wipe and repair them, saying, "The Socialist Education Movement has educated people and also saved these machines." The static eliminator that had never been repaired was also quickly repaired by several electricians.
    "Foreign equipment" is not mysterious, and the workers' confidence in tackling problems became even stronger. How to solve the problem of uneven tension in the single strands when the warping frame was drawing silk? Was it necessary to import new warping frames? Maintenance worker Xu Beirun pondered beside the warping frame for a few days and finally discovered that the uneven tension was caused by the large circle holes, thin circle cores, and uneven pressure. They only spent two yuan to buy some glass tubes to enlarge the circle cores, and they overcame the technical difficulty that had been unsolvable for many years.
    What if a modern factory building has not been built yet? The workers used large pieces of canvas and plastic sheeting to separate the large workshop into small rooms, and they also used waste materials to build an earth-insulated furnace to stabilize the temperature and humidity in the workshop, enabling the warping machines and weft knitting machines to be put into production smoothly.
    This problem-solving effort only took about ten days, and only cost two yuan and some waste materials. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought finally enabled the ten weft knitting machines to play their role.
    With the material factor first, the "treasure" became a "burden"; with the human factor first, the "burden" became a "treasure." The "resurrection" of the ten weft knitting machines at the Guangzhou Knitting Factory educated all the employees of the factory, promoted the ideological transformation of the cadres, and also promoted the workers' efforts to carry out technical innovation. They now understand that only by fully utilizing the role of people can the role of things be fully utilized, and the same equipment can produce more and better products.

    广州针织厂十台经编机投入生产的过程说明
    充分发挥人的作用才能有效发挥物的作用
    春节前夕，广州市场上出现了一批五颜六色的尼龙头巾。这种新产品，一下吸引了许多妇女，很快就卖完了。生产这种尼龙头巾的广州针织厂的工人们比谁都高兴，他们高兴的不只是第一次生产了这种新产品，而是人的因素第一放出了光采，使物的因素终于结出了成果。
    事情原来是这样的：
    一九六一年，国家给广州针织厂装备了十台从国外进口的经编机。这种织造化学纤维的经编机，是世界上纺织技术的“尖端设备”，在全国为数也不多。这样好的机器设备，在生产中该会有多大的作用啊！工厂的领导干部如获至宝，高兴极了，并且吩咐工人不准随便进入经编车间，不准随便动机器，唯恐把“洋宝贝”碰坏了。
    机器不是摆设，是要投入生产，拿出产品来的。工厂的领导干部打的什么主意呢？他们打的还是“物”的主意。有了经编机，又要整经机；有了整经机，又要定型机；有了定型机，又要自动调节温度和湿度的现代化厂房；厂房拨款兴建了，又要进口尼龙原料。总之，在领导干部的心目中，是“物的因素第一”。越是迷信物的因素，越是觉得物的条件还不具备，越是伸手要更多的物质条件。就这样，一年，二年，三年，四年，经编机一直没有正式投入生产。
    上级不断地催问经编机的生产情况。工厂的领导干部每次回答总是：正在试产阶段。可是试产试了几年，质量一直没有保证，烂洞太多。后来，请来了一位专家，发现了质量问题的症结：整经架单条张力不匀。怎么办呢？专家建议进口新的整经架。这时候，工厂的领导干部就有点心烦意乱了。这“洋宝贝”怎么这样难伺候呢？又要进口新的整经架，这话怎好说呢？更不幸的是，试产中有一台经编机上的静电消除器坏了，跑了几处地方，都没有办法修好。就这样，试产试产，领导干部越试越失去信心，试到最后完全泄了气。当初的“宝贝”，这时就被当成“包袱”了。他们几次要求把这堆经编机和配套设备全部调出。一些从上海学习回来的技工和上级派来的技术员，也被他们调离经编车间去干别的工作了。
    请看，强调“物的因素第一”的人，搞“唯机器论”的人，最后竟走向自己的反面，连好端端的机器设备都当成“包袱”，不愿再背了。
    经编机是不是“包袱”？要不要调出？在去年九月开始的社会主义教育运动中，广州针织厂的工人们大学毛主席著作，振起革命精神，就上面这个问题同工厂领导干部展开了一场尖锐的辩论。保全工梁洛贤说：“经编机长期不能投入生产，主要是工厂领导上不重视人的因素，不相信我们工人，不依靠我们工人。一句话，心目中没有我们工人！”有的说：“在洋设备面前，无所作为，这是长洋人的志气，灭自己的威风！”有的说：“把进口的设备当成包袱，是对国家财产极端不负责任的行为。”还有的说：“‘包袱’不在十台经编机上，而是在干部的脑袋上；要调出去的不是机器，而是干部的无所作为的思想！”一场辩论，工厂的几个领导干部出了一身汗，顿时清醒了许多，才感到“见物不见人”，害了自己，也害了机器，也害了生产。
    一个由工人、干部和技术员组成的三结合攻关小组成立了。他们一上来就拆开两台经编机，发现里面并没有什么奥妙，倒是有的部件已经生锈，有的快要腐蚀。老工人见了这种情形，一边赶忙擦洗修饰，一边说：“社教运动教育了人，也救了这些机器。”那个始终没有修好的静电消除器，也由几个电工很快整修好了。
      “洋设备”并不神秘，工人们攻关的信心更足了。整经架拉丝时单条张力不匀的问题怎么解决呢？非进口新的整经架不行吗？保全工徐北润在整经架旁琢磨了几天，终于发现张力不匀，是圈孔太大，圈芯太细，压力不匀造成的。他们只花了两块钱，买了些玻璃管把圈芯套大些，就把多年摸不透的技术难关攻克了。
    现代化的厂房还没有盖起来怎么办？工人们用大块帆布和塑料布把大车间隔成小间，又用废旧材料建造了一座土保温炉，稳定了车间里的温度和湿度，使整经机、经编机顺利地投入了生产。
    这次攻关，只用了十天左右的时间，只花了两元钱和一些废旧材料。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，终于使十台经编机发挥了作用。
    物的因素第一，“宝贝”成了“包袱”；人的因素第一，“包袱”成了“宝贝”。广州针织厂十台经编机“起死回生”的事情，教育了厂里的全体职工，推动了干部们的思想改造，也推动了工人们大搞技术革新。他们现在懂得了：只有充分发挥人的作用，才能充分发挥物的作用，同样的设备就可以生产更多更好的产品。
