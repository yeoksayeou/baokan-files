    Leaders and the Masses
    In the past, it was thought that to improve this factory, a complete change of cadres and workers was necessary. In reality, this was only wanting others to make revolution, without considering how to make revolution ourselves, without examining whether we were relying on and mobilizing the masses.
    Now, with a change in the ideology and work style of the leading cadres, the revolutionary spirit of the workers has been greatly promoted, leading to many innovations. First, a trailblazer, Zheng Jinman, emerged in the tailoring process, followed by Li Zichao, who contributed technical skills, and then Zhou Yunwen, a master of thrift. There was also Li Ernu, who has consistently been diligent and thrifty. It feels like there is something new happening almost every day. Many innovations are proposed and implemented by the workers themselves, achieving high efficiency in a short time with little or no money. This is unlike our past approach of a small number of people working behind closed doors, slowly.
    The rapid change in everyone's mental outlook was something I didn't expect. Some innovations have already been implemented without us even knowing. What does this indicate? It indicates that the leadership is lagging behind the masses. There are no backward masses, only backward leaders.

    领导和群众
    过去认为要搞好这个厂，非把干部、工人大换班不可。实际上，这是只要别人革命，不考虑自己如何革命，不检查自己有没有依靠群众，发动群众。
    现在，领导干部的思想作风一变，职工的革命精神就大大发扬起来，搞了许多革新。裁衣工序先出了个闯将郑金满，又出了个献技术绝招的李子超，后来又出了个节约好手周允文，还有一贯勤俭节约的李二女，真是几乎天天都有新事。许多革新，都是工人自己提，自己动手做的，做到了不花钱或少花钱，实效高，时间快。不象我们过去那样关起门来少数人搞，慢吞吞的。
    大家的精神面貌改变得这么快，这是我原来意想不到的。有些革新已经搞成了，我们还不知道。这说明什么呢？这说明领导落后于群众，没有落后的群众，只有落后的领导。
