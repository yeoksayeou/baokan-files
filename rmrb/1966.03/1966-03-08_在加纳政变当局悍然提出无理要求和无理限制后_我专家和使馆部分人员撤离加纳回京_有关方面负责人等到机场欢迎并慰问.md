    Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Chinese experts who were helping with construction in Ghana under the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Ghana, as well as some staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, the first group of 125 people, have returned to China, and 120 of them returned to Beijing by plane this afternoon.
    The returning personnel arrived in Shanghai on the 5th. Zhou Qinwen, the leader of our architectural expert group, who was brutally beaten and injured by Ghanaian coup troops, experts Yuan Yuncong, translator Jin Zhicai, embassy staff member Guo Binggang, and another sick comrade, have remained in Shanghai for treatment.
    The Chinese experts and some embassy staff members withdrew from Ghana after the Ghanaian coup authorities brazenly unilaterally undermined the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Ghana, unreasonably demanded that all Chinese experts withdraw from Ghana, and unreasonably restricted the number of staff at the Chinese Embassy in Ghana.
    When the returning personnel arrived in Beijing today, Fang Yi, Director of the Foreign Economic Relations Commission; Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Xu Shiping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering; Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry; Huang Hua, our former ambassador to Ghana; Wang Daohan, Du Ganquan, Jia Ke, and hundreds of staff members from relevant departments went to the airport to greet them and express their cordial greetings to the returning personnel. The welcomers presented flowers to all the returning personnel.
    When our experts and some embassy staff members returned to Shanghai by plane, they were welcomed and comforted by Zhang Chengzong, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and responsible persons from relevant departments.

    在加纳政变当局悍然提出无理要求和无理限制后
    我专家和使馆部分人员撤离加纳回京
    有关方面负责人等到机场欢迎并慰问
    新华社七日讯　根据中国和加纳两国经济技术合作协定在加纳帮助建设的中国专家，以及中国驻加纳大使馆部分工作人员，第一批共一百二十五人已经回国，其中一百二十人于今天下午乘飞机回到北京。
    回国人员是在五日到达上海的。曾遭到加纳政变部队士兵野蛮殴打受伤的我国建筑专家组组长周勤文、专家袁允从、翻译金智才、大使馆工作人员郭炳刚，和另外一位患病的同志，已留在上海治疗。
    中国专家和大使馆部分工作人员，是在加纳政变当局悍然片面破坏中国和加纳两国经济技术合作协定，无理要求全部中国专家撤出加纳，同时无理限制中国驻加纳大使馆人数之后，撤离加纳的。
    回国人员今天到达北京的时候，对外经委主任方毅，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，建筑工程部副部长许世平，纺织工业部副部长陈维稷，我国前驻加纳大使黄华，有关方面的负责人汪道涵、杜干全、贾克和机关工作人员数百人，前往机场迎接，向回国人员表示亲切慰问。欢迎的人们向全体回国人员献了花。
    我国专家和大使馆部分工作人员乘飞机回到上海时，曾受到上海市副市长张承宗和有关方面负责人的欢迎和慰问。
