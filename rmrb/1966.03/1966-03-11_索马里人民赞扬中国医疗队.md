    Somali People Praise Chinese Medical Team
    Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu—The "Somali News" recently published a reader's letter saying, "The Somali people express their gratitude to the Chinese medical team who came to our country to fight stubbornly against various diseases." The reader, Abukar Osman, said in the letter that the Chinese doctors are "sincere doctors." He expressed his gratitude on behalf of many patients cured by the Chinese medical team to the Chinese doctors and their Somali assistants.
    After the Chinese medical team arrived in Somalia in early July last year at the invitation of the Somali government, they were warmly welcomed by the Somali authorities and the public. In the hospitals where Chinese doctors work, many patients wait for Chinese doctors to diagnose and treat them every day, many of whom come from afar. Recently, the Chinese medical team successfully performed two esophageal cancer surgeries on patients, which have been highly praised by people from all walks of life in Somalia. (Attached picture)

    索马里人民赞扬中国医疗队
    新华社摩加迪沙电  《索马里新闻》最近登载一封读者来信说，“索马里人民向来到我国同各种疾病作顽强斗争的中国医疗队表示感谢”。读者阿布卡尔·欧斯曼在信中说，中国医生是“诚心诚意的医生”。他代表被中国医疗队医好的许多病人向中国医生和他们的索马里助手们表示感谢。
    中国医疗队在去年七月初应索马里政府的邀请到达索马里以后，受到了索马里当局和公众的热烈欢迎。在中国医生工作的医院，每天都有许多病人等候中国医生的诊治，其中有不少是从远处赶来的。最近，中国医疗队又成功地为病人做了两次食道癌手术，受到了索马里各界人民的高度赞扬。（附图片）
