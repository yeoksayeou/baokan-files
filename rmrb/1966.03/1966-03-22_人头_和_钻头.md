    "Human Heads" and "Drill Bits"
    Zhan Xiang
    Comrade Wei Guangrong, a driller in a Daqing drilling team, once said, "If you only focus on the drill bit and not the human head, you will suffer; if you focus on the human head first and then the drill bit, you will taste sweetness."

    This is a lesson learned from experience, containing both positive and negative experiences, and containing the truth of carrying out revolutionary work.

      "Human head" refers to people's thoughts; "drill bit" refers to things, tools, technology, and professional skills. The relationship between "human head" and "drill bit," in real life, which one plays the dominant role should be very clear. However, some comrades often cannot see it clearly and do not grasp it correctly.

      "Human head" is not an abstract thing. In a society where classes and class struggle exist, "human head" always has class character: there is the "human head" of the proletariat, and there is also the "human head" of the bourgeoisie. Even in the revolutionary ranks where the direction and road are basically the same, "human head" always carries the mark of class, and class struggle cannot but be reflected in the "human head" of the revolutionary ranks.

      "Human head" controls the "drill bit." The state of the "human head," the people's political orientation and ideological awareness, determine how the "drill bit" functions. The "drill bit" is not only manufactured by people and operated by people, but also improved by people and updated by people. The "drill bit" can be used for socialism, and it can also be used for capitalism. It can be used in a way that is fast, efficient, and economical, or it can end up being slow, inefficient, wasteful. It all depends on who is in control. Some people think that "human head" is important, "drill bit" is also important, technology is also important..., and they put the two on the same level, treating them "equally." This view is not Marxism-Leninism, but eclecticism. Failing to distinguish between the principal and secondary aspects, confusing the nature of things, being ambiguous, and appearing to be right but not actually being right, these are the characteristics of eclecticism.

    Under our socialist system, the "drill bit" is a tool of socialist production. The problem is that people must be aware of this. When Daqing "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi stepped onto the drilling platform and gripped the cold brake handle with his powerful hands to start drilling, was he simply treating the brake handle as a tool for drilling wells? No, he first regarded it as a weapon to fight against imperialism and revisionism! Only the "human head" armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have this precious revolutionary consciousness!

    From the leadership's point of view, to lead, one must grasp the "human head." Leadership is the leadership of the masses; what kind of leadership is it if you don't grasp the "human head"? Comrade Wei Guangrong's lesson learned illustrates that whether or not to grasp the "human head" is essentially a question of whether or not to implement leadership.

    Whether or not one attaches importance to the "human head," whether or not one grasps the "human head," this in itself is a "human head" problem. The reason for this lies in the realm of understanding, but the reason rooted in class stand is even more worthy of attention.

    Some comrades "only focus on the drill bit and not the human head" in their work because there is a problem in their own "human head": either their concept of class struggle is weak, or they only see things and not people, and they lack a mass viewpoint...

### “人头”和“钻头”

    “人头”和“钻头”
    战香
    大庆一位钻井队司钻魏光荣同志说过“光抓钻头，不抓人头，吃了苦头；抓了人头，再抓钻头，尝到甜头。”
    这是经验之谈，包含着正面和反面的经验，包含着进行革命工作的真理。
      “人头”，就是人的思想；“钻头”，就是物、工具、技术、业务。“人头”和“钻头”的关系，在实际生活中，究竟是什么起着支配作用，本来是很明显的。可是，有些同志往往看不清，抓不对。
      “人头”不是一个抽象的东西。在存在着阶级和阶级斗争的社会里，“人头”总是有阶级性的：有无产阶级的“人头”，也有资产阶级的“人头”。即使在方向、道路基本一致的革命队伍中，“人头”也总是带着阶级的烙印，阶级斗争不能不反映到革命队伍的“人头”中来。
      “人头”是管“钻头”的。“人头”的状况怎样，人的政治方向和思想觉悟怎样，决定了“钻头”发挥作用怎样。“钻头”不仅由人制造，由人操作，而且由人改进，由人更新。“钻头”可以为社会主义所用，也可以为资本主义所用，可以在使用时做到多快好省，也可以落得少慢差费，这完全是看掌握在什么人手里。有人认为，“人头”重要，“钻头”也重要，技术也重要……，把两者平列起来，“一视同仁”。这种看法，不是马克思列宁主义，而是折衷主义。不分主要方面和次要方面，混淆事物的性质，模棱两可，似是而非，这是折衷主义的特点。
    在我们的社会主义制度下，“钻头”是社会主义生产的工具。问题在于人们要自觉到这一点。大庆“铁人”王进喜同志跨上钻台，用强有力的手握住冰冷的刹把开钻的时候，他是仅仅把刹把当作一个打井的工具吗？不，他首先是把它当成向帝国主义和修正主义斗争的武器！只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的“人头”，才能具有这种可贵的革命自觉！
    从领导的角度来说，要领导，就必须抓“人头”。领导是群众的领导，不抓“人头”，算是什么领导呢？魏光荣同志的经验之谈，说明了抓不抓“人头”也就是要不要实行领导的问题。
    重视不重视“人头”，抓不抓“人头”，这本身也是个“人头”问题。认识上的原因是有的，阶级立场上的原因，更值得注意。
    有些同志在自己的工作中“光抓钻头，不抓人头”，就是因为他自己这个“人头”里有问题：或者是阶级斗争观念淡薄，或者是见物不见人，缺乏群众观点……。
