    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Thu Dau Mot Province in South Vietnam, on February 24th, once again fiercely shelled the Phu Loi Airfield, the base of the U.S. First Infantry Division, destroying 15 U.S. helicopters and killing over 100 U.S. invading troops.

    According to a supplementary report by the same news agency, in the first attack on this airfield on the night of January 30th, the Liberation Armed Forces destroyed a total of 72 U.S. aircraft, 3 armored vehicles, and 3 artillery pieces, burned down numerous barracks, and eliminated over 300 U.S. invading troops.

    Thus, in less than a month, the Liberation Armed Forces of Thu Dau Mot Province launched two fierce attacks on Phu Loi Airfield, destroying a total of 87 U.S. aircraft and annihilating over 400 U.S. invading troops.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th – According to a recent announcement by the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, from January to mid-February, guerrillas throughout South Vietnam, with intense hatred for the U.S. aggressors, shot down over 100 U.S. aircraft of various types with rifles. Many resourceful and courageous guerrilla fighters have emerged in the mass movement to eliminate enemy aircraft.

    Guerrillas in Binh Dinh Province shot down 10 U.S. aircraft and damaged 3 with rifles from January 25th to February 4th. Two guerrillas in Kon Tum Province each shot down a U.S. helicopter with a single rifle bullet. On one occasion, when eight U.S. jet fighters were bombing and strafing Phong Thanh Commune in Ca Mau Province, three guerrillas from the commune, disregarding their own safety, climbed mountains and forded rivers to pursue the enemy aircraft. They shot down a U.S. jet fighter with three rifle bullets and then shot down a U.S. fighter that came to rescue the U.S. pilot.

    Many guerrilla units in South Vietnam not only severely punish enemy aircraft that come to invade but also try every possible means to actively lure enemy aircraft to attack. A young guerrilla group in the Kon Long area of Kon Tum Province once lit a bonfire on the ground, skillfully creating a false target to lure enemy aircraft into a trap. When the enemy aircraft came to bomb and strafe blindly, they concentrated their fire and fiercely struck back, shooting down a U.S. bandit aircraft on the spot. In one battle, the guerrillas in Vi Thanh City, Rach Gia Province, shot down a U.S. fighter, killed two U.S. bandits on board, and captured another bandit alive. Then, the guerrillas put on the U.S. pilots' uniforms and sent out "SOS" signals to lure the U.S. bandits' helicopters to come to "rescue." As soon as the foolish enemy aircraft landed, the guerrilla heroes threw a volley of grenades at it, destroying the U.S. helicopter on the spot.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 14th – Saigon dispatch: On the evening of March 12th, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces shelled the Vung Tau U.S. military airfield, about 60 kilometers southeast of Saigon, with mortars.

    According to Western news agencies, the shelling lasted for about 45 minutes, causing chaos among the defending enemy. U.S. and puppet troops suffered casualties. "Thirty-seven wounded" were transported to a field hospital. At the same time, nearby enemy barracks, military communications schools, and political schools, as well as a village occupied by the enemy, were hit by shells.

    Vung Tau is one of the important coastal bases of the U.S. invaders in South Vietnam. In addition to U.S. aircraft, the Vung Tau airfield also houses aircraft of a group of Australian accomplice troops.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on March 3rd, the Liberation Armed Forces of Gia Dinh Province in South Vietnam completely annihilated an enemy flotilla sailing on the Long Tau River in the Nha Be area, 24 kilometers southeast of Saigon, destroying two minesweepers, one escort vessel, and one 1,000-ton oil tanker.

  According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th – According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on February 22nd, the Liberation Armed Forces of Ca Mau Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on Ca Mau City and nearby enemy troops, completely annihilating one company and two platoons of puppet troops, and also killing and wounding 49 U.S. and puppet troops, including one puppet military officer and 21 U.S. technical personnel, destroying one enemy reconnaissance aircraft and four military vehicles, and seizing a batch of weapons and ammunition.

    This is the third attack launched by the Liberation Armed Forces of Ca Mau Province against enemy troops in Ca Mau City since the beginning of this year.

    “土办法”战胜了“洋家伙”　没有空军也能痛歼美国空军
    南越解放军两袭富利机场毁美机八十七架
    各地游击队一个多月内机智勇敢用步枪打落美机百余架
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量，二月二十四日再次猛烈炮击美国第一步兵师基地富利机场，击毁美国直升飞机十五架，打死美国侵略军一百多名。
    另据这家通讯社补充报道，解放武装力量在一月三十日夜间第一次袭击这个机场的战斗中，共击毁美国飞机七十二架，装甲车三辆，大炮三门，烧毁许多兵营，消灭美国侵略军三百多名。
    这样，土龙木省解放武装力量在不到一个月的时间里，就对富利机场发动了两次猛烈袭击，共击毁美国飞机八十七架，歼灭美国侵略军四百多名。
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放电台最近公布，从一月到二月中旬，越南南方各地游击队怀着对美国侵略者的高度仇恨，用步枪打落各种类型的美国飞机一百多架。在全民消灭敌机的射击运动中，涌现出许多机智勇敢的游击战士。
    平定省游击队从一月二十五日到二月四日，就用步枪打落美国飞机十架，打伤三架。昆嵩省的两个游击队员，各以一发步枪子弹分别打落美国直升飞机一架。有一次，当八架美国喷气式飞机对金瓯省丰盛乡进行狂轰滥炸时，这个乡的三个游击队员不顾自己的生命危险，翻山涉水追击敌机。他们用三发步枪子弹打下美国喷气式飞机一架，接着，又打落前来救援美国飞行员的一架美国驱逐机。
    越南南方许多游击队，不但严惩前来侵犯的敌机，而且还千方百计主动地引诱敌机来打。昆嵩省昆龙地区的一个少年游击小组，有一次在地面上燃起篝火，巧设假目标，诱使敌机上当，当敌机前来盲目轰炸扫射时，他们就集中火力迎头痛击，当场打落美国强盗飞机一架。迪石省渭清市的游击队在一次战斗中，打落了美国驱逐机一架，打死机上的两名美国强盗，并生俘另一名强盗。接着，游击队员们便穿上美国飞行员的衣裳，发出“呼救”信号，诱骗美国强盗的直升飞机前来“救援”。当愚蠢的敌机刚落地时，游击健儿们猛烈向它投出一排手榴弹，就当场摧毁这架美国直升飞机。
    新华社十四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十二日晚上用迫击炮轰击了西贡东南约六十公里的头顿美军机场。
    据西方通讯社报道，炮轰持续了约四十五分钟，守敌一片混乱。美军和伪军都遭到了伤亡。“有三十七名伤员”运入了某野战医院。和这同时，附近的敌人兵营、军事通讯学校和政治学校以及敌人占领的一个村子都挨了炮弹。
    头顿是美国侵略者在南越沿海的重要基地之一。头顿机场除了驻有美国飞机以外，还驻有一批澳大利亚帮凶军的飞机。
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉定省解放武装力量三日在西贡东南二十四公里的芽?地区全部消灭行驶在龙都河上的一个敌军艇队，击毁扫雷艇两艘、护航艇一艘和载重一千吨的油船一艘。
  据新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方金瓯省解放武装力量二月二十二日向金瓯市和附近的敌军发动猛烈袭击，全歼伪军一个连和两个排，另外还打死打伤美伪军四十九名，其中有伪军校级军官一名和美军技术人员二十一名，炸毁敌侦察机一架和军车四辆，缴获武器、弹药一批。
    这是今年年初以来，金瓯省解放武装力量对金瓯市敌军发动的第三次袭击。
