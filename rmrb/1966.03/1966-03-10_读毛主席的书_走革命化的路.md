    Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Taking the Revolutionary Road
    Zhang Yongzhen, Family Member of a Worker at Sichuan Province Automobile Team No. 13

    I am a worker's family member, and in the past, I was often distressed about being a family member. I thought, what future is there in being a family member at such a young age? I complained that the Youth League organization didn't care about me, and I didn't want to participate in learning. I didn't plan the household's financial expenditures either. If I didn't have money, I would ask my husband for it, and if he couldn't give it, I would argue. When things got serious, I would "not care about anything": not caring if the rice was cooked properly, not caring if there was food to eat, not caring if my husband's and children's clothes were dirty, not caring if the children were sick. Looking back now, I was only thinking about myself. How dangerous that kind of thinking was! I really didn't know what I was living for.
    In the winter of 1964, I studied "Combat Liberalism" in the Youth League, and I began to realize the danger of my wrong ideas. Later, the team organized family members to study. Once, I heard about the advanced deeds of Gao Baozhen, the "Good Sister-in-Law" of the plateau, which moved me deeply. Then we studied "Sisters' Tears of Blood and Hatred," which evoked my own bitter memories. Before liberation, I grew up in a poor peasant family in Xinzhen Township, Pingshan County. We ate leftover food, wore ragged clothes, and lived a life worse than animals. Landlords forced us to pay rent and conscripted laborers. My family of thirteen suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation. After liberation, only five of us were left. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to save us, I wouldn't have the happy life I have today. Thinking about this, I regretted not listening to the Party and not listening to Chairman Mao in the past, and forgetting my roots. Soon, the Youth League branch called on us to study Chairman Mao's works, and I was happy from the bottom of my heart. I repeatedly studied eight articles, including "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and I understood that living means serving the people wholeheartedly and being a person who is beneficial to the people. I should not only take care of my children and do a good job with housework, but also do more for the revolution and for the people, and fulfill the responsibilities that a Youth League member and a worker's family member should fulfill.

    Quarreling and Mutual Assistance  In the past, I thought that I depended on my husband for a living, and I couldn't ask for anything from others. I had a very cold attitude towards my neighbors. I didn't interfere in other people's business. If others had difficulties, I would watch with indifference. My relations with the masses were not good. If I encountered a small problem, I would quarrel with others, always wanting to win the argument. After arguing, we would treat each other like enemies. Now I have changed. Not only do I not quarrel with others, but I also try to help them as much as possible. How did I change? Studying Chairman Mao's works opened my mind. Chairman Mao said in his article "Serve the People," "We have come together from all corners of the country and from the five lakes and four seas for a common revolutionary goal."
  "All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, cherish each other, and help each other." Yes! Aren't we dozens of family members following the team and gathering together for a common revolutionary goal? I remember when I gave birth to my third child, everyone helped me invite the doctor, brought me soup and water, and later persuaded me to participate in learning and social activities. What were they doing it for? Why should I quarrel with them? The more I thought about it, the more I realized I was wrong. So I went to Ma Miaoying and Wang Zhizhen, with whom I had quarreled, to exchange views, take the initiative to examine my shortcomings, and improve unity. At the same time, I tried to arrange my housework as quickly as possible every day and take time to help others.

    As my own thinking changed, my relationship with my neighbors also improved. In the past, it was cold and lonely, with quarrels and fights; now it is warm and affectionate, with mutual assistance.

    More Money and Less Money  In the past, I didn't pay attention to saving in my daily life. My husband's monthly salary, plus my income from temporary work, was not enough, and we often quarreled about money. I studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao taught us to establish the idea of hard struggle, diligence, and thrift, and to have long-term plans for doing things. I thought these principles should also be applied to housework. In order to put them into action, I adopted the method of recalling and comparing: I compared my current life with the life before liberation, when we worried about the next meal after eating this one, and compared it with families with less income than us. This comparison revealed the problem. From then on, every month when I received my salary, I would buy all the oil, salt, firewood, and rice for the whole month at once, and deposit the rest in the bank, without spending a penny recklessly.

    I realized that even if you have a lot of money, if you don't pay attention to saving and spend it recklessly when you shouldn't, you will feel like you have less money when you urgently need it; now I don't waste a penny, and when I urgently need to spend money, I feel like I have enough.

    Hindering and Promoting  Chairman Mao taught us that carrying out ideological struggle is a weapon for unity and progress, and that we must use a positive revolutionary spirit to overcome negative liberalism. In the past, my attitude towards my husband was not only committing liberalism, but also "dragging him down." My husband had to come back from work on time, or I would quarrel with him. One Sunday, he hauled two carts of coal ash to pave the road near the team's water pipe. I scolded him for pretending to be active and not knowing to come back early to rest. Several nights, he had to go to participate in learning, and I forced him to ask for leave. Once, he was sick and absent from work and didn't get a production bonus. I grumbled at him. Thinking about it now, how wrong this kind of thinking is! I loved and cared for him from the perspective of personal interests, but in reality, I was not loving him, but harming him, "dragging him down." Now I care for him and help him ideologically, first of all by helping him study Chairman Mao's works. Every night, I prepare "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong," his notebook, and his pen for him, and help him persist in studying. After studying Chairman Mao's works, his work has improved, our feelings have become even better, and our family life has become even happier.

    读毛主席的书  走革命化的路
    四川省汽车十三队职工家属  张永珍
    我是一个职工家属，过去常为当家属而苦恼，心想，年纪轻轻当家属，有什么出息呢？埋怨团组织不关心我，学习也不愿参加。家庭经济开支也不计划，没有钱向爱人要，拿不出来就吵架。闹得严重的时候，我来个“四不管”：饭没有煮好不管，没有菜吃不管，爱人和娃娃的衣服脏了不管，娃儿生病不管。现在想起来，那时一心专为个人打算，这种思想多险！真不知道活着是为了什么。
    一九六四年冬天，我在团内学了《反对自由主义》，开始认识到自己错误思想的危险性。后来，车队又组织家属学习。有一次，听了高原“惠嫂”高宝珍的先进事迹，使我很感动。接着我们又学习了《姐妹血泪仇》，更引起了我辛酸的回忆。解放前，我生长在屏山县新市镇一个贫农的家里，吃的是对时饭，穿的是烂衫衫，过着牛马不如的生活，地主逼租子，拉壮丁，我一家十三口人受尽了压迫和剥削，解放时只剩下五个人。要不是共产党、毛主席来解救我们，我那有今天的幸福生活。想到这些，后悔过去不听党的话，不听毛主席的话，忘了本。不久，团支部号召我们学习毛主席著作，我从心眼里高兴。我反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等八篇文章，懂得了活着就要全心全意为人民服务，要做一个有益于人民的人。我不但要带好娃娃，搞好家务，还应该为革命、为人民做更多的事，尽我一个共青团员、一个职工家属应该尽的责任。
    吵架和互助  过去我认为，我是靠爱人生活的，求不着别人，对左邻右舍的态度很冷淡，河水不犯井水。别人有困难，冷眼相看。群众关系处得不好，碰到一点小问题，就和别人吵架，总想吵个赢；吵嘴以后，见面如仇人。现在我转变了，不但不和别人吵架，还要尽量帮助人家。我是怎样转变的呢？是学习毛主席著作开了窍。毛主席在《为人民服务》这篇文章中说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”
  “一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”是啊！我们几十户家属跟着车队，团聚在一起，不是为了共同的革命目标么？记得我生第三个娃娃的时候，大家帮我请医生，端汤送水，后来又劝我参加学习，参加社会活动。她们为了什么呢？我为什么要和她们吵架呢？越想越不对。我就去找和我吵过架的马妙英、王志珍交换意见，主动检查自己的缺点，搞好团结。同时，我每天尽量快些安排好家务，抽出时间去帮助别人。
    自己的思想转变了，左邻右舍的关系也好转了。过去是冷冷清清，吵嘴打架；现在是亲亲热热，互相帮助。
    钱多和钱少  以往，我在过日子方面不注意节约，我爱人每月的工资，加上我做临时工的收入，还不够用，常常为钱吵架。我带着这个问题去学毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们，要树立艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约、勤俭持家的思想，做事情要有长期打算。我想这些道理也应该用于家务。为了落实到行动上，我采取了回忆对比的办法：我拿现在的生活和解放前吃上顿愁下顿的生活相比，和经济收入比我们少的家庭相比。这一比，就比出了问题。从此以后，每月领了工资，我就把全月油盐柴米一次买齐，剩下的存在银行里，不乱花一分钱。
    我体会到：就是钱多，但不注意节约，不该花的乱花，到急需用钱的时候，就会感到钱少；现在我不浪费一分钱，到急需花钱的时候，反而感到钱够用了。
    促退和促进  毛主席教导我们，开展思想斗争是团结进步的武器，要用积极的革命精神，克服消极的自由主义。过去我对爱人的态度，不但是犯了自由主义，简直是在“拉后腿”。我爱人下班必须按时回来，要不就和他吵架。有一个星期天，他拉了两车炭灰，在车队的水管附近垫路，我骂他假积极，不晓得早点回来休息。有几个晚上，他要去参加学习，我逼着他去请假。还有一次他生病，缺勤，没有得到生产奖，我冲着他发牢骚。现在想起来，这种思想是多么错误啊！我从私人利益去爱他关心他，实际上不是爱他，而是害他，是“拉后腿”。现在我是从思想上关心他、帮助他，首先帮助他学习毛主席著作。每天晚上，我把《毛泽东著作选读》、笔记本、钢笔给他准备好，帮助他坚持学习。学了毛主席著作，他的工作搞好了，我们的感情也更好了，家庭生活也过得更幸福了。
