    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, Bangkok Dispatch: "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station on the 12th called on the people nationwide to resolutely oppose the Thai authorities' sinister plot to turn Thailand into a large concentration camp of U.S. imperialism. The radio station revealed that the Thai authorities are massively driving people in the northeast into "self-reliant villages." These "self-reliant villages" are actually the "strategic hamlets" established by the United States in South Vietnam. The radio station said that the Thai authorities have already driven the people of Nakhon Phanom Province and Sakon Nakhon Province into "self-reliant villages," and are now attempting to drive the people of Ubon Ratchathani Province into "self-reliant villages," causing immense suffering to the people.
    The radio station called on the Thai people to rise up and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom group to stop the Thanom group from turning Thailand into a large concentration camp of U.S. imperialism.
    According to Thai newspapers, Charoon, the Deputy Director-General of the Thai Civil Assistance Department, revealed in February that 44 "self-reliant villages" have been established in various parts of Thailand, imprisoning more than 30,000 households, totaling 200,000 Thai people, and another 50,000 households are about to be imprisoned.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, Bangkok Dispatch: "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station on the 11th condemned the Thai authorities for condoning the U.S. invading troops to commit outrages on Thai soil.
  The radio station said that U.S. troops stationed in Thailand completely disregard Thai law, and criminal U.S. troops are not subject to Thai court sanctions. In October 1964 and June 1965, two U.S. invading troops raped two Thai girls. Because U.S. invading troops enjoy so-called "diplomatic privileges" in Thailand, these two criminals are still at large. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Army Commander-in-Chief Praphas Charusathien openly declared that U.S. invading troops raping Thai girls are not subject to Thai court sanctions under "diplomatic privileges," and "this is very correct."
    According to Thai newspapers, with the connivance of the Thai authorities, more than 20,000 U.S. invading troops stationed in Thailand often get drunk and make trouble, rape women, and run over people near their bases. Americans also use so-called "diplomatic privileges" in Thailand to engage in smuggling activities, damaging Thailand's economic interests.
    Thai newspapers also recently reported that Praphas, with anxiety, admitted on the 8th that university and college students and people from all walks of life in Thailand strongly oppose the Thanom group selling Thailand to the United States as a military base for expanding the Indochina war, and pointed out that the stationing of U.S. troops in Thailand "is aggression."

    “泰国人民之声”电台揭露美帝和他侬政府罪恶活动
    号召人民同美帝及其走狗坚决斗争
    新华社十三日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十二日号召全国人民坚决反对泰国当局把泰国变成美帝国主义大集中营的罪恶阴谋。电台揭露说，泰国当局正在大规模地把东北部的人民驱进“自立村”。这种“自立村”实际上就是美国在南越建立的“战略村”。电台说，泰国当局已经把那空拍侬府和沙空那空府的人民驱进“自立村”，现在又企图把乌汶府的人民驱进“自立村”，使人民遭受莫大的痛苦。
    电台号召泰国人民起来同美帝国主义和他侬集团进行坚决的斗争，制止他侬集团把泰国变成美帝国主义的大集中营。
    据泰国报纸报道，泰国民助厅副厅长乍仑在二月间透露，目前在泰国各地已设立了四十四个“自立村”，囚禁了三万多户共二十万泰国人民，现在还有五万户即将被囚禁。
    新华社十三日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十一日谴责泰国当局纵容美国侵略军在泰国土地上为非作歹。
  电台说，驻泰国美军完全无视泰国法律，犯罪美军不受泰国法庭的制裁。一九六四年十月和一九六五年六月，有两名美国侵略军强奸了两名泰国少女。由于美国侵略军在泰国享有所谓“外交特权”，这两个罪犯至今还逍遥法外。泰国副总理兼陆军总司令巴博公然宣称，美国侵略军强奸泰国少女在“外交特权”下不受泰国法庭制裁，“这样做很对”。
    另据泰国报纸报道，在泰国当局的纵容下，驻在泰国的两万多名美国侵略军，经常在基地附近酗酒胡闹、强奸妇女和驾车压死人。美国人还利用在泰国的所谓“外交特权”，大肆进行走私活动，损害泰国的经济利益。
    泰国报纸最近还报道，巴博在八日带着焦急不安的心情承认，泰国的大、专学校学生和各阶层人民强烈地反对他侬集团把泰国出卖给美国作为扩大印度支那战争的军事基地，并指出，美军驻扎泰国“是侵略”。
