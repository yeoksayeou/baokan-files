    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th - The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee recently convened a rural grassroots political work conference, focusing on how to emphasize politics in rural grassroots work. The conference called on Party organizations at all levels in rural areas throughout the province, as well as the vast numbers of Party members and cadres, to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, strengthen the construction of rural Party branches, create five-good production teams, operate sample fields combining the three major revolutions, and build new socialist villages.

    The representatives attending the conference studied Chairman Mao's discourses on emphasizing politics; in the spirit of rectification, they studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, finding a model for arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding their work; they exchanged experiences in emphasizing politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using politics to lead professional work, and grasping revolution to promote production, learning methods for strengthening grassroots political work.

    The meeting held that politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. Following Chairman Mao's teaching, grassroots political work in rural areas throughout the province is being strengthened step by step. The movement to study Chairman Mao's works is developing further among the vast numbers of cadres and masses. The experience of many typical units shows that because they emphasized politics and creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, people's mental outlook has undergone profound changes, and production has become better and better. Wuying Commune in Suihua County, known as "nine floods in ten years," suffered disasters year after year in the past, and a large part of the masses depended on state relief for their livelihood. Starting in 1963, the Party committee of this commune adhered to emphasizing politics, armed cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, established confidence in overcoming natural disasters, built flood prevention and drainage projects, and established some stable and high-yield fields, finally changing from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area. In three years, it sold a large amount of grain to the state, and the commune also had surplus grain, and the lives of the masses have also improved. Since 1963, the Party branch of Kanggang Brigade of Sifang Commune in Zhaodong County has vigorously grasped political and ideological work and studied Chairman Mao's works extensively. The mental outlook of cadres and commune members has undergone great changes, and grain output has increased year after year. The secretary of the brigade Party branch said: "Grasping ideology solves all problems; if you don't grasp ideology, it's like pulling a roller on uneven ground—one bump after another." After studying a large number of cases, the meeting believed that in order to educate the vast number of peasants into new-type peasants with socialist consciousness and build the province's rural areas into new socialist villages, it is necessary to hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high, create a strong atmosphere of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and deeply root the emphasis on politics. At any time, we must not forget class struggle, not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, not forget relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, not forget the Party's policies, and not forget the Party's work.

    The meeting pointed out that in practical work, many places have not truly put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, have not truly emphasized politics, and have not used Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Some "talk about production in detail, but talk about politics in a formulaic way"; some emphasize production and politics in rotation, emphasizing production when farming is busy and politics when farming is slack; some believe that production is politics, and that if production is done well and more grain is produced, "one good thing can cover up a hundred shortcomings," and so on. The meeting held that confusing politics and production, and replacing politics with production, is actually a kind of eclecticism. Many facts prove that without emphasizing politics and without carrying out the ideological revolution of people, production will stagnate and society will regress. Therefore, whether or not to emphasize politics, and whether or not to put political work in the first place, is actually a major issue of whether or not to adhere to class struggle, whether or not to adhere to revolution, and is also the key to whether or not production can get better and better.

    The meeting pointed out that emphasizing politics means emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Some cadres still lack understanding of this. The meeting required that grassroots Party branches and cadres put emphasizing politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in

    黑龙江省农村基层政治工作会议提出号召
    用毛泽东思想加强农村党支部建设
    创造五好生产队，办好三大革命相结合的样板田
    新华社哈尔滨二十日电　中共黑龙江省委最近召开农村基层政治工作会议，着重研究了在农村基层工作中如何突出政治的问题。会议号召全省农村各级党的组织和广大党员、干部，用毛泽东思想作指导，加强农村党支部建设，创造五好生产队，办好三大革命相结合的样板田，建设社会主义新农村。
    出席会议的代表学习了毛主席有关突出政治的论述；用整风的精神，学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，找到了用毛泽东思想武装自己、指导工作的榜样；交流了突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作、以政治带业务、抓革命促生产的经验，学到了加强基层政治工作的办法。
    会议认为，政治是统帅、是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。遵循着毛主席的这一教导，全省农村基层政治工作正在一步步地加强。在广大干部和群众中，学习毛主席著作的运动正在进一步发展。许多典型单位的经验说明，它们由于突出了政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻变化，生产搞得越来越好。被称为“十年九涝”的绥化县五营公社，过去连年受灾，很大一部分群众靠国家救济生活。从一九六三年开始，这个公社的党委坚持突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众，树立了战胜灾荒的信心，建设防涝排涝工程，建立起一部分稳产高产田，终于由缺粮变为余粮，三年中卖给国家大批粮食，社内还有余粮，群众生活也改善了。肇东县四方公社康岗大队党支部从一九六三年以来狠抓政治思想工作，大学毛主席著作，干部和社员的精神面貌发生了很大变化，粮食产量连年上升。大队党支部书记说：“抓思想一通百通，不抓思想就横垄子拉滚子——一步一个坎。”会议研究了大量事例以后认为：要把广大农民教育成具有社会主义觉悟的新型农民，把全省的农村建设成社会主义新农村，必须把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，把活学活用毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的，把突出政治的根子扎得深深的，任何时候都不忘记阶级斗争，不忘记无产阶级专政，不忘记依靠贫农下中农，不忘记党的政策，不忘记党的工作。
    会议提出，在实际工作中，许多地方还没有真正把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，还没有真正突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。有的“讲生产头头是道，讲政治穿靴戴帽”；有的是生产和政治轮流突出，农忙突出生产，农闲突出政治；有的认为生产就是政治，把生产搞好，多打了粮食，“一俊可以遮百丑”，等等。会议认为，把政治和生产混为一谈，用生产代替政治，这实际上是一种折衷主义。许多事实证明，不突出政治，不搞人的思想革命化，生产就会停滞，社会就会倒退。所以，突出不突出政治，是不是把政治工作放在首位，实际上是坚持不坚持阶级斗争，坚持不坚持革命的大问题，也是生产能不能够越搞越好的关键。
    会议指出，突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，目前有的干部对这一点还缺乏认识。会议要求，基层党支部和干部要把突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。会议指出，农村中党的支部和人民公社生产队，是进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的基层单位，因此，必须千方百计地加强政治工作，在日常工作中随时随地注意突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想。首先，要加强党支部的建设，彻底克服单纯抓生产，忽视政治工作、忽视党的工作的现象。党支部要组织党员带头学好毛主席著作，象解放军那样，坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想，做好人的工作。要发扬理论和实际相结合、和人民群众紧密地联系在一起以及自我批评的三大作风，建立活学活用毛主席著作、密切联系群众、批评与自我批评的三项制度。要坚持贯彻民主集中制，实行集体领导，充分发扬党内民主。要做好接收新党员的工作。培养好革命接班人。要逐步建立公社各级的政治机构。其次，创造五好生产队，培养五好社员，开展比学赶帮超运动。要高举旗，多树点，一帮一，一带二，把比学赶帮超运动广泛深入地开展起来。第三，办好三大革命相结合的样板田。要把样板田办成政治上的旗帜，生产上的模范，科学实验上的尖兵，做到政治思想、生产、科学、人才四丰收。还必须发扬大寨的自力更生的革命精神，依靠集体力量切实发展生产。
    会议特别强调了县、社领导干部革命化的问题，认为这是把突出政治落实到基层的关键。会议要求县、社党委负责干部要带头学好用好毛主席著作，首先用于改造自己的主观世界，切实克服一般化的领导作风，深入蹲点，总结经验，用榜样的力量去推动工作。
    参加会议的有地委组织部长、宣传部长、农村工作部长，部分县委书记、县长，县委农村工作部长，学习毛主席著作好的公社党委书记和大队党支部书记，以及部分样板田负责人等共四百多人。
