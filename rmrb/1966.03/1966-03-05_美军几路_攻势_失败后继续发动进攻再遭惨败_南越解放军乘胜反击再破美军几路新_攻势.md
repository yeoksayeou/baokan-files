    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th Dispatch from Saigon: Starting in late February, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces further demonstrated the power of people's war. On the one hand, they ensured that the multiple "offensives" of the U.S. aggressor troops and their accomplice forces either went nowhere or were fiercely attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces at unfavorable times and locations for the enemy. On the other hand, taking advantage of the enemy being out on "sweeps" and their isolated "strongholds" being empty, they launched fierce attacks on the enemy's lairs, causing them to be caught off guard and suffer heavy losses.

    According to Western news agencies, on February 20th, the U.S. Marine Corps, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the so-called "Operation Double Eagle," launched the "Second Phase" of the "Operation Double Eagle" near Tam Ky in Quang Nam Province with a force of 6,000 men, together with 2,000 South Vietnamese puppet troops. However, like the "First Phase," this "offensive" repeatedly failed, and they had to announce on March 1st that they were "ending the twelve-day offensive without encountering the Viet Cong."

    It is reported that after the U.S. First Infantry Division's aggressive troops launched the so-called "Pile Driver," "Deer Hide," "Quick Kick Four," and "Roundhouse" "offensives" near Saigon in January and suffered failures, on February 21st, they launched new "offensives" called "Mighty Mite" and "Rolling Stone" in the area 50 kilometers north and northeast of Saigon, with a division-sized force and allied with the Australian accomplice troops. The "Mighty Mite" offensive's "mighty" army carried out an armed parade for a week, repeatedly failed, and had no results, and had to be declared over on the 27th. At the same time, the Liberation Armed Forces chose favorable locations and timing, and on the night of the 24th, fiercely attacked the enemy troops launching the "Rolling Stone Offensive" in the Nha Do and Phuoc Son areas, bringing into full play the superiority of close combat and night combat, wiping out two battalions and two armored convoys of the First Infantry Division in one fell swoop, and severely damaging a battalion of Australian accomplice troops, inflicting a devastating blow on that enemy force.

    It is reported that the troops of the U.S. First Cavalry Division, who had been carrying out the "White Wing Offensive" in the Phu My area for a long time, suffered heavy casualties due to continuous attacks by the Liberation Armed Forces. On February 23rd, they had to withdraw the battered Second Brigade from the battlefield for reorganization. On March 2nd, the "White Wing Offensive," renamed from "Crusher Offensive," was again renamed the bizarre "Black Horse Offensive." However, no matter how the code name was changed, the fate of failure could not be changed after all. After the launch of the "Black Horse Offensive," the seemingly strong but inwardly weak enemy has repeatedly failed in the past two days.

    Taking advantage of the enemy's large-scale "sweeps," the Liberation Armed Forces have launched fierce attacks on U.S. military lairs in recent days.

    It is reported that on February 25th, 28th, and March 2nd alone, the Liberation Armed Forces took the initiative to attack the U.S. Marine Corps near Phu Bai base three times. On the 28th, the Liberation Armed Forces ambushed three companies of the Marine Corps nine kilometers southeast of Phu Bai, severely beating them for more than six hours, killing and wounding a large number of enemies. On March 2nd, two companies of U.S. Marine Corps aggressor troops were beaten up again by the Liberation Armed Forces at the same location. In addition, U.S. military bases in Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Hue were also actively attacked by the Liberation Army in late February, and the garrisons suffered heavy casualties.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd Telegram: The Vietnamese *People's Army Newspaper* published a commentary on the 2nd, pointing out that no matter how many troops U.S. imperialism sends to South Vietnam, it will not be able to seize the initiative on the battlefield, but will only encounter increasingly disastrous defeats.

    The commentary pointed out that a large number of U.S. aggressor troops had just set foot on the land of South Vietnam when they fell into an extremely passive predicament, and were subjected to successive attacks by the Southern army and people. Under the powerful people's war waged by the Southern army and people, the U.S. aggressor troops had to divide their forces to defend the "ink blots," and also had to disperse to open up important transportation lines, especially to deal with the continuous attacks by the army and people in various parts of the South. Therefore, no matter how many U.S. troops it sends, it will inevitably fall into the net of people's war in South Vietnam.

    The commentary pointed out that in many battles, the U.S. military has not yet encountered the main force of the Liberation Army, but has only been hit by guerrillas, and has already been beaten dizzy. The U.S. military vainly attempts to "actively" attack the "Viet Cong main force," but the Liberation Army's main force sometimes takes the initiative not to fight, and sometimes takes the initiative to give the U.S. military a fatal blow. Even in their "actively" launched "sweeps," the U.S. military is very passive. The South Vietnamese army and people have not only smashed their "sweeps," but have also continuously counterattacked and annihilated them. The battles in Cu Chi, Phu My, and Ben Cat have already proved this point.

    The commentary said that the U.S. aggressor troops are in a completely passive and defensive position on all battlefields in South Vietnam. Guerrillas and the Liberation Army in various places are dividing the enemy to fight, day and night, in the rainy season, and also in the dry season, in the mountains, plains, and cities. No matter how frantically the United States struggles, it cannot avoid suffering increasingly disastrous defeats.

### 美军几路“攻势”失败后继续发动进攻再遭惨败  南越解放军乘胜反击再破美军几路新“攻势”

    美军几路“攻势”失败后继续发动进攻再遭惨败
    南越解放军乘胜反击再破美军几路新“攻势”
    越《人民军队报》指出美国增兵多少也改变不了被动局面
    新华社四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量从二月下旬开始，进一步发挥人民战争威力，一方面使美国侵略军及其帮凶军的多次“攻势”不是纷纷扑空，就是在对他们不利的时间和地点被解放武装力量揪住了猛揍；另一方面乘敌人外出“扫荡”，孤立的“据点”空虚之际，猛袭敌人的巢穴，打得敌人顾此失彼，损失惨重。
    据西方通讯社报道，二月二十日，在所谓“双鹰攻势”中惨遭失败的美国海军陆战队，又出动六千人的兵力，伙同二千名南越伪军，在广南省三岐附近发动了“双鹰攻势”的
  “第二阶段”。但是，和“第一阶段”一样，这个“攻势”也连连扑空，不得不在三月一日宣布“在没有同越共遇遭的情况下结束了历时十二天的攻势”。
    据报道，美国第一步兵师的侵略军一月在西贡附近发动的所谓“木槌”、“鹿皮”、“快踢四号”、“圆屋”等等“攻势”遭到失败后，二月二十一日，又以师的规模，伙同澳大利亚帮凶军，在西贡以北和东北五十公里地区，发动了所谓“猛犬”、“滚石”等新的“攻势”。“猛犬”攻势的“浩浩荡荡”的大军进行了历时一周的武装大游行，连连扑空，毫无结果，二十七日不得不宣布结束。与此同时，解放武装力量却选择了有利的地点和时机，二十四日夜间在芽多和蓬庄地区，抓住发动“滚石攻势”的那股敌军痛打，发挥近战、夜战的优越性，一举全歼第一步兵师的两个营和两个装甲车队，重创澳大利亚帮凶军一个营。使那股敌人遭到歼灭性的打击。
    据报道，在较长时期内在蓬山地区进行
  “白翼攻势”的美国第一骑兵师的部队，由于不断遭到解放武装力量的痛击，伤亡巨大，在二月二十三日，不得不把被打得七零八落的第二旅撤离战场进行整编。三月二日，从“捣碎机攻势”改名的“白翼攻势”又被改名为稀奇古怪的“黑马攻势”。但是，代号尽管改来改去，失败的命运终究不能改变。“黑马攻势”发动后两天来，外强中干的敌人又连连扑空。
    解放武装力量乘敌人大批外出“扫荡”之际，连日来猛袭美军巢穴。
    据报道，单在二月二十五日、二十八日和三月二日，解放武装力量就三次主动进攻芙拜基地附近的美国海军陆战队。二十八日，解放武装力量在芙拜东南九公里的地方，突然袭击海军陆战队的三个连，把它们狠狠地揍了六个多小时，大量杀伤敌人。三月二日，两连美国海军陆战队侵略军在同一个地点又被解放武装力量痛打了一顿。此外，岘港、朱莱、顺化等地美军基地也在二月下旬遭到解放军的主动袭击，驻军死伤累累。
    新华社河内三日电　越南《人民军队报》二日发表评论指出，不管美帝国主义增派多少军队到越南南方，也无法夺取战场上的主动权，而只会遇到日益惨重的失败。
    评论指出，大批美国侵略军刚刚踏上越南南方的土地，就陷于极为被动的窘境，遭到南方军民的接连进攻。在南方军民强大的人民战争的威力下，美国侵略军一面要分兵把守“墨渍”，一面又要分散开来打通重要交通线，尤其是要对付南方各地军民的连续进攻。因此，不管它增派多少美军，都必将陷入越南南方人民战争的天罗地网之中。
    评论指出，在许多战斗中，美军还没有遇到解放军的主力部队，只是遭到游击队的打击，就已经被打得晕头转向。美军妄想“主动”攻打“越共主力”，但解放军主力时而主动不打，时而主动给予美军以致命的打击。就连美军在他们“主动”发动的“扫荡”中，也十分被动。越南南方军民不仅粉碎了它们的“扫荡”，而且还连续反击消灭它们。古芝、蓬山和边葛等地的战斗，就已经证明了这一点。
    评论说，美国侵略军在越南南方各个战场上完全处于被动挨打的境地。各地的游击队和解放军正在把敌人分割开来打，日夜地打，雨季打，旱季也打，山区打、平原和城市也打。不管美国怎样疯狂挣扎，也无法避免遭到日益惨重的失败。
