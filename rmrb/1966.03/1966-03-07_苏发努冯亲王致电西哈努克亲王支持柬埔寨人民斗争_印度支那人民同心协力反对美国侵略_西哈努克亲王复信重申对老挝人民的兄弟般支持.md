    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, March 5th (via Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on March 5th): Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, pointed out in a telegram sent to Cambodian Head of State Norodom Sihanouk on February 1st, that the situation in Laos is becoming increasingly serious due to the U.S.'s planning of new military conspiracies. He also expressed hope that the peoples of the three Indochinese countries would further promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, working together to achieve a swift victory in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    The telegram reiterated firm support for the just struggle of the Cambodian people to safeguard the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It also reaffirmed that the Lao people stand firmly with the Cambodian people, advancing shoulder to shoulder in the battle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    The telegram pointed out that just as the U.S. imperialists are plotting new military adventures in both regions of Vietnam and instigating the Thai reactionaries and the Saigon puppet regime to constantly intimidate and provoke the neutrality, independence, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the U.S. imperialists intend to send U.S. ground troops into Laos to directly attack and occupy central and lower Laos, introducing B-52 strategic bombers into Laos to slaughter the Lao people. Their aim is to turn central and lower Laos into a bridgehead linking their main battlefield in South Vietnam with their military bases in Thailand, in order to realize their plot to expand and intensify the war of aggression against Laos. The telegram said that the Washington ruling clique and its lackeys, in order to deceive public opinion and cover up their crimes of aggression, are now repeating the old tune, saying that "North Vietnam is using Lao territory to infiltrate South Vietnam." The U.S. imperialists' habitual tactic of "the thief crying stop thief" cannot deceive public opinion and is destined to fail.

    The telegram said that although their new military conspiracies have been exposed and condemned by the Lao people, the peoples of Indochina, and progressive world opinion, the U.S. imperialists are warlike by nature and will continue to blindly embark on the path of intensifying the war of aggression in Indochina. Under such circumstances, all peace-loving and justice-upholding governments and peoples of Asia and the world must not stand idly by and allow the U.S. imperialists to repeatedly trample on the national sovereignty of all countries. On the contrary, they must resolutely take all corresponding measures to oppose their conspiracies and acts of aggression. Therefore, it can be foreseen that the war of aggression against Laos will take extremely fierce forms and may extend beyond the scope of Indochina, thereby greatly exacerbating the situation in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The telegram emphasized that the Lao Patriotic Front's position in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is firm and unwavering. Whether the U.S. aggressors support the Vientiane puppet regime and the puppet army in continuing the special war (which is essentially a new type of war of neo-colonialist aggression), or send their own expeditionary forces into Laos to directly occupy Laos, no matter what form and scale this war of aggression takes, the Lao people will continue to struggle in various forms until final victory.

    The telegram said that we are in similar situations, so we understand with sympathy the various difficulties suffered by the fraternal Cambodian people due to the interference and aggressive policies of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. We express our heartfelt admiration for the indomitable fighting spirit and achievements made by the Cambodian people, under Your Highness' wise leadership, in the struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and in defending the independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia. These achievements of great significance are a great encouragement to the Lao people, and at the same time make valuable contributions to the struggle of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for independence and national sovereignty, and against imperialism-colonialism headed by U.S. imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 4th (via Cambodian News Agency report on March 4th): Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk recently wrote a letter to Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, warmly thanking the Lao Patriotic Front for its support of the Cambodian people's struggle against U.S. aggression, and reaffirming Cambodia's support for the Lao people's righteous actions in defending the sacred rights of Lao independence and territorial integrity.

    This letter is Prince Sihanouk's reply to Prince Souphanouvong's telegram of February 1st.

    Prince Sihanouk wrote in his letter: "Just as you do, we also know that the United States, with the help of its mercenary army, mainly Thai mercenaries, is attempting to launch a military offensive and occupation of lower Laos in order to realize its plan to expand its direct aggression against Vietnam. Cambodia reiterates its fraternal support for your righteous actions in defending the sacred rights of Lao independence and territorial integrity."

    Prince Sihanouk said: "We warmly hope that all countries that love justice and peace will join you and us in protesting the new plans of the U.S. warmongers to once again undermine the already signed agreements and the United Nations Charter."

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, March 3rd (via Pathet Lao Radio broadcast): According to incomplete statistics, from January to February 20th this year, more than 12,400 people in upper, central, and lower Laos participated in rallies and demonstrations against U.S. aggression in Laos.

    These rallies passed thousands of protest letters, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to directly send troops to occupy central and lower Laos, demanding that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs immediately stop attacking central and lower Laos, and demanding that U.S. imperialism immediately stop sending aircraft to bomb the liberated areas.

    The masses participating in rallies in various places expressed their determination to unite around the Lao Patriotic Front, actively participate in production, support the front lines, and carry the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle through to the end.

    Lao Patriotic Army and People in Attopeu, Sam Neua, etc. Annihilate More Than 400 Puppet Troops

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, March 5th (via Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on March 5th): On February 27th, the Lao Patriotic Army and people of Attopeu Province annihilated 104 U.S.-puppet troops invading the Muang Khong area, killing 100, capturing 4, and seizing many weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

    This radio station broadcast a few days ago that the Patriotic Army and people of Attopeu Province had killed 65 enemies who were "mopping up" in the Muang Khong area in early February and captured 29.

    In Sam Neua Province, in battles to counter U.S.-puppet offensives against the Houi To, Houi Thoun, and Phou Xaloy liberated areas on February 6th, the Patriotic Army and people annihilated a total of 94 enemies and seized a large number of weapons and ammunition. The Patriotic Army and people in the Ta La and Na Khang areas of this province killed 114 enemies, including an American officer, in the bandit suppression battles from February 17th to 19th for three days; captured 43 enemies, and seriously injured the bandit leader Vang Pao. In the operations, the Patriotic Army and people seized 15 artillery pieces of various calibers, 20 light and heavy machine guns, and shot down 2 aircraft.

    苏发努冯亲王致电西哈努克亲王支持柬埔寨人民斗争
    印度支那人民同心协力反对美国侵略
    西哈努克亲王复信重申对老挝人民的兄弟般支持
    新华社康开五日电　据巴特寮电台五日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在二月一日打给柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的电报中指出，老挝的局势由于美国策划新的军事阴谋而日趋严重，并且表示希望印度支那三国人民进一步发扬团结互助精神，同心协力，以从速取得反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争的胜利。
    电报重申坚决支持柬埔寨人民为维护柬埔寨王国的独立、主权和领土完整而进行的正义斗争，并且重申老挝人民在反对共同敌人——美帝国主义及其仆从——的战斗中坚决同柬埔寨人民站在一起，并肩前进。
    电报指出，正当美帝国主义者阴谋对越南两个地区策划新的军事冒险计划，唆使泰国反动派和西贡傀儡政权不断对柬埔寨王国的中立、独立和领土完整进行恫吓和挑衅的时候，美帝国主义者打算把美国地面部队派进老挝来直接进攻和占领中寮和下寮地区，把B—52型战略轰炸机引进老挝来屠杀老挝人民，其目的是为了把中寮和下寮地区变成把他们在南越的主要战场同他们在泰国的军事基地连结起来的桥头堡，实现他们扩大和加强侵略老挝的战争的阴谋。电报说，华盛顿统治集团及其仆从为了欺骗舆论和掩盖他们的侵略罪行，现在又重弹老调，说什么“北越利用老挝领土渗入南越”。美帝国主义者惯用的“贼喊捉贼”的昭然若揭的手法是骗不了舆论的，而且注定是要遭到失败的。
    电报说，尽管他们新的军事阴谋已经遭到老挝人民、印度支那各国人民和世界进步舆论的揭露和谴责，但是美帝国主义者的本性是好战的，他们还要继续盲目地走上加紧侵略印度支那战争的道路。在这样的形势下，一切爱好和平和主持正义的亚洲和世界各国政府和人民决不能袖手旁观和听任美帝国主义者一再践踏各国人民的国家主权，相反，必须坚决采取一切相应的措施来反对他们的阴谋和侵略行动。因此，人们可以预料，侵略老挝的战争将采取极其激烈的形式，并将可能超出印度支那的范围，从而大大地加剧东南亚和世界局势。
    电报强调指出，老挝爱国战线党在抗美救国斗争中的立场是坚定不移的。不管美国侵略者支持万象傀儡政权和傀儡军继续进行特种战争（实质上这是一种新殖民主义侵略的新型战争），还是把自己的远征军派进老挝来直接侵占老挝，不管这场侵略战争采取什么形式和规模，老挝人民将采取各种形式继续进行斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    电报说，我们处境相似，所以怀着同情的心情来理解由于美帝国主义者及其仆从的干涉和侵略政策使兄弟的柬埔寨人民所遭受的种种困难。我们对柬埔寨人民在殿下的英明领导下在反对美国侵略者及其仆从、维护柬埔寨王国的独立、中立和领土完整的斗争中所表现的不屈不挠的斗争精神和取得的成就表示由衷的钦佩。这些具有巨大意义的成就是对老挝人民的莫大的鼓舞，同时也是为争取亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的独立和国家主权、反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义——殖民主义的斗争作出了宝贵的贡献。
    新华社金边四日电　据柬埔寨新闻社四日报道：柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王最近写信给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，热烈感谢老挝爱国战线党对柬埔寨人民反对美国侵略的斗争的支持，并且重申柬埔寨支持老挝人民保卫老挝独立和领土完整的神圣权利的正义行动。
    这封信是西哈努克亲王对苏发努冯亲王二月一日来电的复信。
    西哈努克亲王在信中写道：“正如你们一样，我们也知道，美国在其雇佣军、主要是泰国雇佣军的帮助下，企图对下寮展开军事进攻和占领，以便实现它扩大对越南直接侵略的计划。柬埔寨重申对你们保卫老挝独立和领土完整的神圣权利的正义行动的兄弟般的支持。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“我们热烈希望所有爱好正义和和平的国家同你们和我们一起，抗议美国好战分子准备再次破坏已经签订的协议和联合国宪章的新计划。”
    据新华社康开三日电　据巴特寮电台广播：据不完全统计，今年一月到二月二十日，老挝上寮、中寮和下寮地区共有一万二千四百多人参加了反对美国侵略老挝的集会和游行示威。
    这些集会通过了成千份抗议书，强烈谴责美帝国主义阴谋直接派兵侵占老挝中寮和下寮地区，要求美帝国主义及其走狗立即停止进攻中寮和下寮地区，要求美帝国主义立即停止派遣飞机轰炸解放区。
    参加各地集会的群众都表示决心团结在老挝爱国战线党的周围，积极参加生产，支援前线，把反美爱国斗争进行到底。
  老挝阿速坡桑怒等地爱国军民歼灭伪军四百多人
    新华社康开五日电　据巴特寮电台五日广播，老挝阿速坡省爱国军民二月二十七日歼灭进犯芒球地区的美伪军一百零四人。其中打死一百名，俘虏四名，并且缴获许多武器、弹药和军用物资。
    这家电台前几天广播，阿速坡省爱国军民在二月初曾经打死在芒球地区进行“扫荡”的敌人六十五名，俘虏二十九名。
    在老挝桑怒省，爱国军民二月六日在反击美伪进攻会多、会敦和富沙里解放区的战斗中，共歼灭敌人九十四名，缴获大批武器弹药。这个省的塔拉和纳康地区的爱国军民曾经在二月十七日到十九日三天的剿匪战斗中，打死敌人一百一十四名，其中有一名美国军官；俘虏敌人四十三名，重伤匪首王宝。爱国军民在作战中，缴获各种口径的大炮十五门，轻、重机枪二十挺，击毁飞机二架。
