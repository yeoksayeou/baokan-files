    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 28th – After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, ninety percent of the county, district, and commune-level leading cadres of Yichang County, Hubei, have gone to the forefront of agricultural production with Chairman Mao's writings, production tools, and luggage to study Chairman Mao's writings with the masses, participate in production, and solve problems existing in production.
    On February 12, Feng Yunhan, deputy secretary of the county party committee, carrying his luggage, braved the snow and went to the Dingjiaba Brigade of the Xiaoxita Commune to stay and work. As soon as he put down his luggage, he joined the commune members in carrying soil to improve the sandy fields. During breaks, he also led the commune members in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Returning to the home of poor peasant Cao Shifu, he helped with carrying water and grinding grain. Poor and lower-middle peasant commune members said, "This comrade is really good. As soon as he arrives, he works with us and doesn't put on any airs of a cadre." The Xia'an Brigade of the Wayaoping Commune is a production team newly planting citrus trees. Last year, it was threatened by drought and pests, and now these "two harms" have reappeared, worrying the commune members. At this time, Ma Baoshan, deputy secretary of the county party committee, arrived. He climbed Jinzi Mountain with cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants to investigate and found a spring on the mountain. After measurement and surveying, they found that as long as a winding canal was built with a hundred or so workdays, it could irrigate more than four thousand fruit trees on the mountain, ensuring a bumper harvest of citrus. Subsequently, they discovered several other springs on other hills, finding ways to overcome drought and reduce pests. The masses happily said: The county committee leaders came just in time.
    After studying, the cadres of the Sandouping District were determined to change the face of Sandouping more quickly. They analyzed that the main reasons why the face of Sandouping had not changed much were twofold: first, the leadership core of the district committee had not been revolutionized; second, the situation was unclear. They vigorously grasped the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings and organized investigation teams, using Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of investigating wind vents and exploring quicksand, to understand the natural laws of Sandouping. They specifically clarified four bases: the base for converting slopes into terraced fields, the base for planting trees and afforestation, the base for building water conservancy projects, and the base for developing diversified management. They first conducted typical investigations and then proposed a draft for changing the face of the entire district. Now, Jian Yourong, the district head of this district, has led a working group to the Longtan Brigade of the Gaojia Commune for pilot projects. He ate, lived, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the second production team of this brigade, conducted preliminary investigations and research on the natural conditions, and is drawing up a blueprint for changing the face of the brigade.
    Qu Jiali, the newly appointed party secretary of the Xiaofeng Commune, had not completely "settled" down after several months in office. After studying the deeds of Jiao Yulu, he immediately bought a hoe and a sickle, and went to the Xiaofenghe Brigade with "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to stay and work. He earnestly participated in labor, picked the dirtiest and most tiring work to do, and cared for the lives of the masses. When the quilt of the "five-guarantee" household Chen Yousheng was dirty, he helped wash it; when the quilt of the orphan Chen Guangyuan was torn, he helped mend it as if he were his own son.
    Recently, a snow fell in the Yichang area. Many leading cadres, remembering Comrade Jiao Yulu's words, "Communist Party members should appear in front of the masses when the masses are most difficult," braved the wind and snow to visit the poor and lower-middle peasants to inquire about their well-being and help solve their difficulties.

    宜昌县各级领导干部带着毛主席著作和生产工具
    深入第一线  决心蹲好点
    新华社武汉二十八日电　湖北宜昌县的县、区、社三级领导干部学习焦裕禄同志的事迹以后，百分之九十的人带着毛主席著作，带着生产工具和行李，到农业生产第一线去，同群众一道学习毛主席著作，一道参加生产，一道解决生产中存在的问题。
    县委副书记冯运汉二月十二日背着行李，踏着雪，到小溪塔公社丁家坝大队蹲点。他把行李一放，就同社员一起挑土改沙田，休息时又领导社员学习毛主席著作，回到贫农曹世富家，又帮忙挑水、推磨。贫农下中农社员说：“这位同志真好，一来就跟我们一块劳动，看不出一点干部架子。”瓦窑坪公社下岸大队是新种植柑桔的生产队，去年曾受旱灾和虫灾的威胁，现在这“两害”又露头，社员们正为这事担心。这时，县委副书记马宝山来到了这里。他同干部、贫农下中农一道爬上金子山调查，发现山上有一股泉水，经过丈量勘测，只要花百把个工，开一条盘山渠，就可以灌溉山上四千多棵果树，能确保柑桔丰收。接着，他们又在另几个山头上发现几处泉水，找到了战胜旱灾和减少虫害的办法。群众高兴地说：县委领导来得真及时。
    三斗坪区的干部在学习以后，决心较快地改变三斗坪面貌。他们分析三斗坪面貌所以改变不大，主要原因是两条：一是区委领导核心没有革命化；二是情况不明。他们一面狠抓活学活用毛主席著作；一面组织调查组，用焦裕禄同志查风口、探流沙的革命精神，摸清三斗坪的自然规律。具体弄清四个底：坡改梯田的底，植树造林的底，兴修水利的底，发展多种经营的底。先作典型调查，然后提出改变全区面貌的草案。现在，这个区的区长简友荣已带领一个工作组，到高家公社龙潭大队作试点。他在这个大队第二生产队和贫农下中农同吃同住同劳动，对自然条件作了初步的调查研究，正在绘制改变面貌的蓝图。
    小峰公社新任党委书记屈家立，到职几个月还没有完全“沉”下去。学了焦裕禄的事迹，马上买了锄头、镰刀，带着《毛泽东选集》到小峰河大队蹲点。他认真参加劳动，拣最脏、最累的活干，关心群众生活。五保户陈有生的被子脏了，他帮忙洗；孤儿陈光元的被子破了，他象对自己的儿子一样帮他补好。
    最近宜昌地区下了一场雪，许多领导干部记住焦裕禄同志的话：“共产党员应该在群众最困难的时候，出现在群众的面前”，顶风踏雪，到贫农下中农家中去问寒问暖，帮助解决困难。
