　　In the past, the work of our county committee was also quite demanding. Most of the members spent two-thirds of the year in the countryside, traveling a lot and enduring much hardship. Sometimes we ate dry rations when hungry and drank water from the canals when thirsty. However, we couldn't achieve any significant results in our work. Why? In the past, we thought it was due to low ideological level and poor ability, a matter of working methods. Now, after examining ourselves in light of Comrade Jiao Yulu, we have found the problem: Although we went to the countryside, our hearts remained at the top. We didn't immerse ourselves among the masses and didn't trust them. Why didn't we trust the masses? Upon strict self-examination, the fundamental problem is that we couldn't shed our "official" airs. With official airs, we were afraid of hardship in our hearts and couldn't take the lead. With official airs, our class feelings weren't strong, and we were ideologically distant from the masses. Therefore, in our work, there were three excesses and three deficiencies: We went down with our own preconceived notions, issuing orders was excessive, consulting and discussing with the masses was deficient; we spent more time following基层干部 (basic-level cadres) around, and little time genuinely talking to the masses; we spent more time flying around on the surface, and little time earnestly dissecting sparrows. Naturally, we couldn't do our work well this way.

　　We also didn't do our work well because we lacked Comrade Jiao Yulu's burning class feelings for the people. Comrade Jiao Yulu thought of the people's food and shelter in heavy snow, and had deep feelings for every blade of grass and tree in Lankao. What about us? Although we sometimes cared about some specific problems of the masses, in our hearts we always felt there was a gap between us and the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants. What was the reason? Our Ye城 County Committee leadership team mostly came from the petty bourgeoisie and didn't pay enough attention to ideological remoulding in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. Our concern for the masses stemmed more from the idea of "being responsible to the superiors." Helping the masses solve a few difficulties was often with a condescending attitude. We couldn't truly feel the pain and love for the masses from the bottom of our hearts. How could we mobilize the masses' enthusiasm to do our work well?

　　Looking at ourselves in the mirror of Comrade Jiao Yulu, we deeply feel that to do our work well, we must be of one heart and one mind with the masses. To be of one heart and one mind with the masses, we must transform all non-proletarian ideas and train ourselves to become proletarian revolutionary fighters, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, truly loving and caring for the masses and faithfully serving the people. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must carry forward the fine revolutionary traditions, maintain a hardworking and simple work style, and share weal and woe with the people of the whole county at all times, resolutely achieving "five nos" and "five yeses": No special treatment, no extravagance, no waste, no official airs, no fear of hardship and fatigue; Yes to integrity and public service, yes to taking the lead in labor, yes to treating people equally, yes to daring to shoulder heavy responsibilities, yes to educating family members to treat people with equality. We will fight for the people's cause for the rest of our lives.

    要和群众心贴心
    过去，我们县委的工作也很不轻闲，大部分成员一年总有三分之二的时间在乡下，跑了不少路，吃了很多苦，有时饿了啃干粮，渴了喝渠水，但在工作上就是跑不出个名堂。为什么呢？过去认为思想水平低，能力差，是个工作方法问题。现在对照焦裕禄同志来检查自己，问题找出来了，这是因为我们人虽然下乡了，但是心还在上面，不深入群众，不相信群众。为什么不相信群众？严格检查起来，根本问题还是放不下“官”架子，有了官架子，思想深处就怕苦，不能身先士卒；有了官架子，阶级感情就不浓厚，和群众在思想上有距离。因此，在工作中存在着三多三少：带着自己的框框下去，指手划脚的多，和群众商量研究的少；下乡跟着基层干部转的多，与群众真正谈心少；浮在上面满天飞的多，踏实蹲下来解剖麻雀少。这样当然做不好工作。
    做不好工作，还因为我们缺乏焦裕禄同志那种对人民群众的火热的阶级感情。焦裕禄同志在大雪纷飞时想到群众的吃住，对兰考的一草一木都有深厚的感情。而我们呢？虽然有时也关心群众的一些具体问题，但在思想深处总觉得和群众，特别是和贫下中农群众有个道道隔着。原因在哪里？我们叶城县委这个领导班子，大都出身于小资产阶级，平时没有严格按照毛主席的教导重视思想改造。我们关心群众多出于“对上级负责”的思想，帮助群众解决一点困难，常常是怀有恩赐观点，不能对群众真正从心里疼起来、爱起来。这样怎能发挥群众的积极性，去做好工作呢？
    照了焦裕禄同志这面镜子，我们深深感到，要做好工作，就要和群众心贴心；要和群众心贴心，就必须改造一切非无产阶级思想，锻炼成为无产阶级的革命战士，象焦裕禄同志那样，真正地疼群众、爱群众，忠实地为人民服务。象焦裕禄同志那样发扬革命的优良传统，保持艰苦朴素的工作作风，时时处处和全县人民同甘共苦，坚决做到“五不”、“五要”。即不闹特殊，不讲排场，不铺张浪费，不摆官架子，不怕苦怕累；要廉洁奉公，要带头劳动，要平等待人，要敢于挑重担子，要教育家属也以平等态度待人。为人民的事业奋斗终生。
