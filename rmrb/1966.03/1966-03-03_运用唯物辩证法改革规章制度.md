    Using Materialist Dialectics to Reform Rules and Regulations
    Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Li Si
    Starting in 1964, in accordance with the requirements of the revolution in enterprise management, we rectified and revised the railway transportation rules and regulations. This revision changed the previous method of a few people sitting in the office "building a cart behind closed doors." We adopted the method of going downstairs and out of the hospital, delving into reality, going to the masses to investigate and research, and widely soliciting opinions from material consignment departments, passengers, and grassroots employees. We used materialist dialectics to analyze and study the problems that were exposed. Through such a mass appraisal and critical analysis, everyone further recognized that the old rules and regulations contained many remnants of capitalist management ideology, such as departmentalism, a purely indicative viewpoint, and a purely economic viewpoint. At the same time, it was discovered that many contents of the old regulations were seriously divorced from reality and the masses. We made necessary reforms to all of these. We deeply realized that the process of revising the rules and regulations was actually a process of learning and applying materialist dialectics.
    Opposing Subjective One-Sidedness, Transportation Plans Must Serve Production and Circulation
    Under the socialist economic system, the railway transportation of goods, like industrial and agricultural production, must implement the principle of planned management. The railway must not only carry goods according to the plan, but also try its best to realize the transportation plan. However, in the past, we did not proceed from reality when formulating plans, and in execution, we one-sidedly emphasized the seriousness of the plan and rigidly acted according to the plan. For example, when some enterprises needed to add to the transportation plan due to increased production and overproduction, we were afraid of breaking the original transportation plan and affecting the original work arrangements of our department. We only agreed to material units going through the formalities for transportation outside the plan and controlled the transportation outside the plan very tightly. Increased production and overproduction are obviously good things, but from the perspective of emphasizing the fulfillment rate of railway transportation plans, we regarded good things as "bad things." Therefore, many enterprise departments reflected: "The railway transportation plan does not serve production and circulation; instead, production and circulation must serve the realization of the railway transportation plan."
    The transportation plan is a component of the national economic plan, and it is subordinate to the production, supply, and sales plans. It should conform to the laws of production and circulation and adapt to the needs of production and circulation. Leaving the needs of production and circulation, pursuing the realization of the transportation plan in an isolated and one-sided way inevitably violates the objective laws of the development of things. Chairman Mao taught us: "The so-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions." "In fact, this balance and unity are broken locally every month and every quarter, and local adjustments need to be made." In the past, when dealing with transportation planning work, we often regarded the balance and unity of the plan as something immutable. In this way, we naturally could not correctly handle various specific problems occurring in transportation planning work according to the needs of objective development, thereby causing the transportation plan to go to its opposite, affecting production development, and hindering commodity circulation.
    In this revision of the rules and regulations, we realized that transportation planning work should jump out of the small circle of considering issues from the perspective of the railway department itself and must act according to the objective laws of the development of things, linking transportation with production, supply, and sales. We must never regard the transportation plan as something fixed and unchangeable; it should develop and change with the development and changes of production. Starting from this understanding, the new regulations first changed the old method of waiting for enterprise departments to submit plans. The railway department actively participated in the work of material distribution plans, delving into production, supply, and sales to understand the sources of goods and the laws of cargo flow, and working with material units to prepare transportation plans. For goods that had already been included in the plan for the month but had not been loaded, regardless of whether it was the responsibility of the shipping unit or the railway, as long as they had been moved into the loading area and were not passing through difficult sections, they could be arranged to be loaded in the first ten days of the next month without having to go through the formalities for transportation outside the plan. The station will accept and promptly organize the loading and transportation of emergency agricultural materials for drought resistance, flood prevention, drainage, disaster relief, epidemic prevention, and emergency planting and harvesting, as well as other emergency materials, regardless of whether there is a plan. The new regulations also relaxed the regulations on changing the departure and destination stations and the names of goods based on the actual situation. These reforms have been welcomed by material units and grassroots employees. Everyone believes that this facilitates the units consigning materials and accelerates the transportation of materials, so that railway transportation can better serve industrial and agricultural production.
    Starting from the Overall Interest, Strengthening the Responsibility of the Railway
    In the process of transporting goods, the railway has to deal with a large number of material consignment units. In order to handle this relationship well, it is necessary to reasonably divide the responsibilities of the railway and the material consignment department in the transportation process. In our country, both the railway and the material consignment department are socialist enterprises, and their interests are consistent. Dividing transportation responsibilities means carrying out necessary division of labor according to different work positions. This division of labor is based on the premise of mutual assistance and cooperation. Therefore, we must never treat the issue of dividing responsibilities with a bourgeois viewpoint. In particular, the railway transportation department should strictly demand itself to assume more responsibility and solve practical problems for consignment units in the spirit of actively serving the material department, and jointly guarantee the completion of material transportation tasks.
    Some provisions in the old transportation rules and regulations regarding the division of transportation responsibilities did not correctly handle the relationship between the railway and the material department, but proceeded from shirking the railway's responsibility and safeguarding the local interests of the railway department. Such regulations are essentially a concrete reflection of the bourgeois viewpoint. Take the provision of when the railway begins to be responsible for the consigned goods as an example. The old regulations stipulated that the railway would only "accept for carriage" goods after they were loaded into the truck, and only then would it begin to be responsible for the goods. This provision became the railway's "air-raid shelter" for shirking responsibility. Because the situation where the goods moved by the material unit to the station could not be loaded into the truck on the same day was very common. If they were not loaded into the truck, they would not be considered "accepted for carriage," and the railway would not be responsible for safekeeping. The material consignment unit had to send people to the station to guard the goods themselves, and they also had to prepare their own moisture-proof equipment. This brought many difficulties to enterprise departments.
    The requirements for cargo packaging were vaguely stipulated in the old regulations: the shipper should apply appropriate packaging according to the transportation distance, climate conditions, and weight. On the surface, it seemed very reasonable, but in essence, it only benefited the railway in shirking responsibility. Some railway staff members often used this as an excuse that the packaging was not good and asked the shipper to note "packaging is not strong, and damage is the shipper's responsibility." In this way, when the goods were damaged, the railway could completely shirk responsibility.
    This time, we criticized the departmentalism that previously considered issues in isolation from the interests of the railway department and correctly handled the responsibility relationship between the railway and the shipping and receiving units, reforming these unreasonable regulations. The new regulations emphasized that we should consider issues from the overall interests of protecting state materials, strengthened the responsibility of the railway, and stipulated that in special, first-class, and second-class stations, the railway would be responsible for safekeeping once the goods were moved in, based on the actual situation of the current railway equipment conditions. In third-class and below stations, the railway should also actively create conditions to gradually open safekeeping services. Currently, more than 400 railway stations across the country have opened this safekeeping service. The new regulations also stipulate that the railway should actively help consignment units research and improve cargo packaging. Regarding the handling of compensation for cargo transportation accidents, the new regulations also changed the previous incorrect practices of "pushing," "delaying," and "denying," emphasizing that the responsibility for the accident should be determined truthfully and that compensation should be actively paid to material units to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of shippers and consignees. The implementation of the new regulations shows that this series of reforms has not only strengthened the cooperative relationship between the railway and brother enterprises but also helped to establish a reasonable responsibility system so that the people's railway can better serve the people.
    Opposing Absolutism, Correctly Handling the Relationship Between Safety and Efficiency
    Like other industrial and mining enterprises, railway transportation must put safe production in an important position. Only by ensuring the safety of passengers and goods can we talk about better service. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to stipulate some measures to ensure transportation safety in railway rules and regulations. However, things are always interconnected and mutually influential, and the issue of transportation safety is not isolated or absolute. If we excessively exaggerate the aspect of ensuring safety, we will neglect other aspects. Being safe for safety's sake will also go to its opposite, playing not a positive role but a negative role in production.
    In the past, railway regulations stipulated the transportation conditions for dangerous goods such as explosives and flammable materials and fragile goods too strictly and rigidly. It is necessary to separately stipulate certain packaging conditions for this type of goods according to its nature, or to designate special stations to handle the transportation of those chemical products with strong explosive properties. However, if we indiscriminately apply overly strict and rigid restrictions to these goods with varying degrees of danger without analysis, we will inappropriately expand the scope of dangerous goods. For example, the old regulations listed daily small commodities made of celluloid, such as hairpins, eyeglass frames, and ping-pong balls, and general medicinal products such as Shidi Shui and iodine tincture, as dangerous goods. They also put forward harsh packaging requirements for these goods and even strictly restricted the stations that could handle the transportation of these goods. This artificially hindered the circulation of these daily necessities for the people. Brother enterprises engaged in these small commodities were also dissatisfied with this one-sided approach of the railway.
    Not only that, but within the railway's internal operations, the scope of dangerous goods names prohibited from humping shunting operations was also inappropriately expanded. It is in line with the need to ensure safety to prohibit humping operations when loading and unloading explosives, flammable materials, and fragile goods when trains are assembled and disassembled at the station and these vehicles are moved, in order to avoid accidents caused by collisions. However, the old regulations even listed toxic and crude miscellaneous goods in the names of goods prohibited from humping. This affected the railway's operating efficiency and tied up the production enthusiasm of grassroots employees.
    In this process of reforming the rules and regulations, we realized that we must never treat the issue of transportation safety with a one-sided and isolated viewpoint. We must strive to accelerate the transportation of materials and improve transportation efficiency on the premise of ensuring safety. The new regulations revised the scope of dangerous goods names, relaxed the transportation conditions for certain dangerous goods, and facilitated the transportation of daily chemical, medicinal small commodities, and materials supporting agriculture. At the same time, through repeated on-site experiments, the scope of dangerous goods names prohibited from humping shunting operations was re-stipulated. The implementation of the new regulations shows that these regulations can not only ensure transportation safety but also accelerate the transportation of materials and improve transportation efficiency. According to the new regulations, the number of prohibited humping cars can be reduced by half, and the station's shunting efficiency has increased by 15% to 20% compared to before. In this way, the new regulations better reflect the inherent dialectical relationship between safety and efficiency.
    Specific Analysis of Specific Problems, Handling the Relationship Between General and Individual Well
    Things are ever-changing, diverse, and varied. Rules and regulations cannot cover everything in detail and can only make provisions based on the commonality of things. Precisely because of this, when formulating rules and regulations, it is necessary to conduct specific analysis of various situations and problems in the work, distinguishing which are frequent phenomena, which are accidental phenomena, which are the mainstream of things, and which are the secondary aspects of things. Only through such specific analysis and research can the rules and regulations correctly reflect the objective regularity in the work.
    Some of the old rules and regulations violated the principle of specific analysis of specific problems. For example, the old passenger transportation regulations stipulated that passengers traveling without a ticket would be fined 2.5 yuan in addition to making up for the ticket; passengers who got off the train halfway and stopped traveling would not be refunded for their tickets. This provision was originally intended to prevent bad elements from engaging in fraud and seemed to be very reasonable. In practice, however, it was both unworkable and unreasonable. Taking passengers traveling without a ticket as an example, most of them boarded the train because they did not have time to buy a ticket temporarily, and some lost their tickets along the way. After all, the speculative and opportunistic elements who deliberately did not buy tickets were extremely few. If we do not ask about the circumstances and do not distinguish between objects, fining everyone uniformly would be somewhat unreasonable. Not only would the majority of passengers have opinions, but the employees at the station and on the train would also find it difficult to implement. The provision of no refunds for getting off the train halfway was also to prevent bad elements from engaging in fraud, and it was not easy to detect at intermediate stations. Bad elements engaging in fraud is an extremely individual and abnormal phenomenon, while the situation where passengers need to terminate their trip due to illness or other reasons is a more common and normal phenomenon. If we restrict the legitimate demands of the majority of passengers in order to prevent the speculative behavior of individual bad elements, this violates the principle that the people's railway should facilitate passengers everywhere.
    When we studied and revised this provision, we studied and applied the viewpoint of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" and made a specific analysis of the situation of passengers traveling without a ticket and refunds for getting off the train halfway. The new regulations stipulate that passengers traveling without a ticket can adopt differentiated treatment methods according to different situations: fines will only be added if it is clearly determined that they are engaging in speculation or fraud; generally, if they do not have time to buy a ticket or lose their ticket for some reason, they only need to make up for the ticket; passengers who stop traveling halfway for some reason can apply for a refund as long as they apply to the railway.
    Breaking Down Sophistry, Giving Full Play to People's Active Role
    The old transportation rules and regulations were numerous and complex in content. The complicated rules and regulations have their historical roots. After liberation, we inherited some of the methods of the old railways and also copied many foreign rules and regulations. These rules and regulations simply talk about constraints and neglect the active factors of people. As a result, they often expose serious contradictions that are seriously divorced from the current production reality, and there are often situations where the rules and regulations are mutually repetitive or "fighting." Since the rules and regulations are contradictory and repetitive and cannot solve practical problems, explanations and revisions must be made everywhere, "patching" everywhere, and therefore the more revisions are made, the more chaotic they become.
    The fact that transportation rules and regulations have long been numerous, chaotic, and divorced from reality also has its ideological roots. This is that in enterprise management, we have the erroneous idea of simply relying on rules and regulations and not believing in the masses. In the old rules and regulations, there were many overly detailed, rigid, and unrealistic provisions. Some stations' "Detailed Technical Management Rules" were as long as 50,000 to 60,000 words, and even the location of the medical center was stipulated.
    The old transportation rules and regulations were so many, so chaotic, so detailed, and so rigid that not only could the staff and masses who implemented the rules and regulations not see, remember, and implement them, but even the cadres who personally participated in the formulation and management of the rules and regulations could not remember and manage them. Therefore, some employees simply put the rules and regulations aside and acted according to their own "experience" and imagination. When there are too many rules and regulations, no one reads them or manages them, which is equivalent to a pile of waste paper. However, in the past, we sitting in the offices always believed that modern transportation tools like railways require a high degree of accuracy and centralized unity, and that it would be impossible to do a good job of transportation work without a strict and complete set of rules and regulations. Therefore, we demanded that everything be strictly handled in accordance with the rules and regulations, no matter how big or small. Although we talked about relying on the masses to do a good job in railway transportation work, we always put the rules and regulations above the human factor in our hearts.
    Of course, a modern, large, complex transportation industry like the railway needs a strict and complete set of rules and regulations to manage it well. However, the starting point of enterprise management is not simply relying on dead rules and regulations but should rely on giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. At the same time, there should be a correct understanding of the quantity, detail, and strictness and completeness of the rules and regulations. The rules and regulations should reflect the party and the state's policies and guidelines. In principle and on major issues, the rules and regulations should strive to be comprehensive, complete, and in line with the actual situation. For specific operation processes and operation methods, it is not necessary to require all of them to be stipulated. Otherwise, the rules and regulations will go to the road of sophistry and become things that bind the masses' hands and feet, and will be regarded by the masses as a pile of useless waste paper. Therefore, we have streamlined the transportation rules and regulations drastically this time. The new transportation regulations only have two external regulations (passenger regulations and cargo regulations) and three internal operation rules, totaling less than 150,000 words, which is 90% less than the old regulations. Since the implementation of the new regulations, the broad masses of passengers, material consignment units, and grassroots railway employees have been very satisfied.
    Rules and Regulations Play a Promoting Role in Production
    Through this reform of the transportation rules and regulations, we have deeply realized that rules and regulations have a great impact on people's production practice. Many facts prove that because many of the old transportation rules and regulations were stipulated from the perspective of the local interests of the railway, and many of them were divorced from production practice, this has fostered departmentalism and bureaucracy in our railway transportation work, hindering the railway from better serving production and the people. The new transportation rules and regulations have eliminated the old provisions of departmentalism and bureaucracy, enhanced the service viewpoint and the overall viewpoint, and simplified transportation procedures and improved service quality in every way from the perspective of facilitating passengers and material consignment units. Because the guiding ideology of the new regulations is clear, although it has been in trial implementation for almost half a year, many good people and good deeds of grassroots units, employees, and the masses actively serving passengers and enterprise departments have already emerged throughout the railway.
    Rules and regulations are a reflection of people's understanding of objective things in a certain period, and objective things are constantly changing and developing. Precisely because of this, we must not adopt a once-and-for-all attitude towards reforming rules and regulations. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, through the cyclical process of practice – understanding – re-practice – re-understanding, enable our thinking to constantly adapt to the changing objective situation, consciously transform the subjective world, and continuously reform the rules and regulations so that they can correctly reflect objective production practice in order to make the railway transportation work even more outstanding.

    运用唯物辩证法改革规章制度
    铁道部运输总局副局长　李斯
    我们从一九六四年开始，按照企业管理革命化的要求，整顿和修改了铁路运输规章制度。这次修改，改变了以往只由少数人坐在办公室里“闭门造车”的办法，采取下楼出院，深入实际，到群众中去调查研究，广泛征求物资托运部门、旅客和基层职工的意见，对暴露出来的问题运用唯物辩证法进行分析研究。经过这样一次群众性审查鉴定和分析批判，使大家进一步认清了旧规章制度中存在着不少资本主义经营管理思想的残余，例如本位主义、单纯指标观点和单纯经济观点等。同时也发现了旧规章中有不少的内容严重地脱离实际、脱离群众。对此，我们都进行了必要的改革。我们深刻地体会到，这次修改规章制度的过程，实际上是一次学习和运用唯物辩证法的过程。
    反对主观片面，运输计划必须为生产、流通服务
    在社会主义经济制度下，铁路运输货物和工农业生产一样，必须实行计划管理的原则。铁路不仅要按计划承运货物，而且要尽量使运输计划付诸实现。但是，过去我们制订计划不从实际出发，在执行中又片面地强调计划的严肃性，死板地按计划办事。例如，在有的企业因为增产、超产需要追加运输计划的时候，我们唯恐冲破原来的运输计划，影响本部门原定的工作安排，只同意物资单位办理计划外运输的手续，而对于计划外运输又卡得很紧。增产、超产明明是好事，从强调铁路运输计划兑现率的角度去看，却把好事当成了“坏事”。所以，不少企业部门反映：“铁路的运输计划不是为生产、流通服务，倒是生产、流通要为铁路运输计划的实现服务。”
    运输计划是国民经济计划的一个组成部分，它是从属于生产、供应、销售的计划的。它应该符合于生产和流通的规律，适应生产和流通的需要。离开生产和流通的需要，孤立地片面地去追求运输计划的实现，这就必然违反事物发展的客观规律。毛主席教导我们说：“所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。”“事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整。”我们过去在处理运输计划工作的时候，常常把计划的平衡和统一看成是一成不变的东西，这样，自然就不能按照客观发展的需要去正确地处理运输计划工作中发生的各种具体问题，因而使运输计划走到了它的反面，影响生产发展，阻碍商品流通。
    在这次改革规章制度的工作中，我们认识到运输计划工作应该跳出从铁路本部门出发考虑问题的小圈子，必须按照事物发展的客观规律办事，把运输同产、供、销各个方面联系起来。决不能把运输计划看做是固定不变的东西，应该随着生产的发展、变化而发展、变化。从这样的认识出发，新规章首先改变了以往等待企业部门提报计划的老办法，铁路部门主动地参与物资分配计划工作，深入产、供、销各个环节，摸清货源、货流规律，会同物资单位编好运输计划。对于当月已经列入计划但未装出的货物，不分是发货单位还是铁路的责任，只要已经搬进货位和不是通过困难区段的，都可以安排在次月上旬补装，不必再办理计划外运输的手续。有关抗旱、防洪、排涝、抢险、防疫以及抢种抢收的紧急支援农业物资和其他紧急物资，不管有无计划，车站都随时受理，迅速组织装运。新规章还从实际情况出发，放宽了变更发、到站和货物品名的规定。这些改革受到物资单位和基层职工的欢迎，大家认为这样做便利了托运物资的单位，加速了物资的运送，铁路运输就能更好地为工农业生产服务。
    从整体利益出发，加强了铁路的责任
    铁路在运输货物的过程中，要同广大的物资托运单位发生关系，为了处理好这种关系，需要合理划分铁路和物资托运部门在运输过程中的责任。在我国，铁路和物资托运部门都是社会主义性质的企业，利益是一致的，划分运输责任，也就是按照工作岗位的不同，进行必要的分工。这种分工是以互助协作为前提的。因而绝不能用资产阶级观点来对待划分责任的问题。特别是铁路运输部门，更应该本着积极主动为物资部门服务的精神，严格要求自己多承担责任，多为托运单位解决实际问题，共同保证完成物资运输任务。
    旧的运输规章制度中关于划分运输责任的某些规定，不是正确地处理铁路与物资部门间的关系，而是从推卸铁路责任，维护铁路本部门局部的利益出发的。这样的规定实质上是资产阶级观点的具体反映。就以铁路从什么时候开始对托运货物负责这项规定来说吧，在旧规章里规定，铁路要在装车以后才算“承运”货物，这时才开始对货物负责。这样规定就成为铁路推卸责任的“防空洞”了。因为，物资单位搬到车站的货物当天来不及装车的情况是很普遍的，不装车就不算“承运”，铁路就可以不负保管责任，物资托运单位只好自己派人来车站看管，防湿用具也要自己准备。这就给企业部门带来了不少困难。
    对货物包装的要求，在旧规章里只含糊地规定：发货人要根据运输距离、气候条件、重量大小，加以适当的包装。表面看来似乎很合理，实质上只是有利于铁路推脱责任。有些铁路工作人员往往因此借口包装不好，要发货人注明“包装不固，破损自己负责”。这样，在货物损坏的时候，铁路就可以把责任推脱得一干二净。
    这次我们批判了过去孤立地从铁路本部门利益出发考虑问题的本位主义思想，正确地处理了铁路同发、收货单位的责任关系，改革了这些不合理的规定。新规章强调了要从爱护国家物资的整体利益出发考虑问题，加强了铁路的责任，根据当前铁路设备条件的实际情况，规定在特、一、二等车站，货物一经搬入就由铁路负责保管。在三等以下车站，铁路也要积极创造条件，逐步开办保管业务。现在全国铁路已经有四百多个车站开办了这项保管业务。新规章还规定，铁路要主动帮助托运单位研究改善货物包装。对于处理货运事故的赔偿问题，新规章也改变了以往“推”“拖”“赖”的不正当作法，强调要实事求是地判明事故责任，主动向物资单位支付赔偿，以维护发货人和收货人的正当权益。新规章试行的情况表明，这一系列的改革，既加强了铁路和兄弟企业的互相协作关系，也有助于建立合理的责任制度，使人民铁路能够更好地为人民服务。
    反对绝对化，正确处理安全与效率的关系
    铁路运输和其他工矿企业一样，必须把安全生产放在重要的位置上，只有确保了旅客和货物的安全，才能谈得上更好地服务。所以，铁路规章制度中规定一些保障运输安全的措施是完全必要的。但是，事物总是互相联系互相影响的，运输安全的问题也不是孤立的、绝对的，如果我们过分地夸大了确保安全的一面，就会忽视其他方面。为安全而安全，也就会走到它的反面，对生产不是起积极的作用，而是起消极的作用了。
    过去，铁路规章中对于爆炸品、易燃品等危险货物和易碎品的运输条件规定得过严过死。对于这一类货物按照它的性质分别规定一定的包装条件，或者对那些有强烈爆炸性的化工物品，指定专门的车站办理运输，都是必要的。但是，如果不加分析地对这些危险程度不尽相同的货物，同样加以过严过死的限制，就会不恰当地扩大了危险货物的范围。例如，旧规章把发卡子、眼镜框、乒乓球等赛璐珞制的日用小商品和十滴水、碘酒等一般医药用品，都列为危险货物，对这些货物也提出了苛刻的包装要求，甚至严格限制了办理运输这些货物的车站。这样就人为地阻碍了这些人民生活必需商品的流通。经营这些小商品的兄弟企业对铁路这种片面做法也不满意。
    不仅如此，在铁路内部作业中，也不恰当地扩大了禁止溜放调车作业的危险货物品名范围。装有爆炸品、易燃品、易碎品的车辆，在车站编解列车、调动这些车辆的时候，为了避免因冲撞发生意外事故，禁止溜放作业，这是符合保证安全的需要的。但是旧规章甚至把毒害品、粗杂品也列在禁止溜放货物品名中。这样，就影响了铁路的作业效率，束缚了基层职工的生产积极性。
    在这次改革规章的过程中，我们认识到决不能用片面的孤立的观点去对待运输安全问题，必须在保证安全的前提下力求加速物资的运输和提高运输效率。新规章中修改了危险货物品名范围，放宽了某些危险货物的运输条件，便利了日用化工、医药小商品和支援农业物资的运输。同时，也通过下现场反复试验，重新规定了禁止溜放调车作业的危险货物品名范围。新规章试行的结果说明，这些规定既可以保证运输安全，又可以加速物资的运输，提高运输效率。按照新规定禁溜车可以减少一半，车站的调车效率比以前提高了百分之十五至百分之二十。这样，新规章就比较好地反映出安全与效率内在的辩证关系。
    具体问题具体分析，处理好一般同个别的关系
    事物是千变万化、多种多样的，规章制度不可能面面俱到，只能根据事物的共性作出规定。正因为如此，所以在制定规章制度的时候，必须对工作中的各种情况和问题进行具体的分析，区别哪些是经常有的现象，哪些是偶然的现象，哪些是事物的主流，哪些又是事物的次要方面。只有这样具体的分析研究，才能使规章制度正确反映工作中的客观规律性。
    旧的规章制度有一些就违背了具体问题具体分析的原则。如旧客运规章规定，旅客无票乘车，除补票以外还要罚款二元五角；旅客中途下车停止旅行，铁路一概不办理退票。这样规定原是为了防止坏分子弄虚作假，似乎是很有理由的。在实际中却是执行不通也不合理。就拿无票乘车的旅客来说，大多数都是因为临时来不及买票才上车的，也有途中遗失客票的，故意不买票的投机取巧分子究竟是极少数。如果不问情节，不分对象，一律罚款，就有些不近情理了，不仅广大旅客有意见，车站和列车上的员工也感到难于执行。中途不退票的规定，也是为了防止坏分子弄虚作假，中途站不易发现。坏分子弄虚作假是极个别的不正常的现象，而旅客因病因事需要中止旅行的情况却是比较多的正常现象。如果我们为了防止个别坏分子的投机行为而限制了广大旅客的正当要求，这就违反了人民铁路应该处处方便旅客的原则。
    当我们研究修改这个规定的时候，学习和运用了毛泽东同志《矛盾论》的观点，对旅客无票乘车和中途退票的情况作了具体分析。新规章规定对无票乘车的旅客，可以根据不同情况，采取区别对待的办法：查明确是投机取巧或弄虚作假的才加罚款；一般因故来不及买票或遗失客票，只办理补票就行；中途因故停止旅行的旅客，只要向铁路提出，就可以办理退票手续。
    打破烦琐哲学，充分发挥人的积极作用
    旧的运输规章制度数量很多，内容烦琐。规定烦琐的规章制度是有其历史根源的。解放后，我们沿袭了一些旧铁路的办法，又照搬了许多外国的规章条文。这些规章制度单纯讲制约，忽视人的积极因素，因而常常会暴露出严重脱离当前生产实际的矛盾，也常常会出现规章制度互相重复或“打架”的情况。既然规章矛盾重复，不能解决实际问题，就又要做解释，做修改，处处“打补钉”，因而越改越多，越补越乱。
    运输规章制度所以长期存在着又多又乱，脱离实际的现象，还有其思想上的根源。这就是我们在企业管理中，存在着单纯依靠规章命令办事，不相信群众的错误思想。在旧规章制度中，有许多过细过死、脱离实际的规定。有的车站的《技术管理细则》，竟多达五六万字，甚至把医疗所的位置也作了规定。
    旧运输规章制度这么多、这么乱、这么细、这么死，不仅执行规章制度的职工群众看不了、记不住，很难执行得通；甚至连亲自参加制订规章和管理规章的干部也记不住、管不了。所以，有的职工干脆把规章制度撂在一边，凭自己的“经验”、臆想办事。规章制度多了，反而没人看、没人管，等于一堆废纸。可是，过去我们坐在机关里，总认为象铁路这样现代化的运输工具，要求高度的准确和集中统一，如果没有一套严密完整的规章制度，是不可能搞好运输工作的。因此，事无巨细都要求严格按规章制度办事。虽然嘴上讲依靠群众搞好铁路运输工作，心眼里却总是把规章制度放在人的因素之上。
    当然，象铁路这样现代化的庞大复杂的交通运输业，是需要有一套严密完整的规章制度，才能管理好的。但是企业管理的立足点，决不是单纯依靠死的规章制度，而应该依靠发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性。同时，对于规章制度的多、细和严密完整，也应当有一个正确的理解。规章制度应当体现党和国家的方针政策，在原则上，在重大问题上，规章制度应该力求订得全面一些，完整一些，切合实际情况；对于具体的作业过程和作业方法，就不必一一要求都作出规定。否则，规章制度就要走到烦琐哲学的道路上去，成为束缚群众手脚的东西，就会被群众视为一堆毫无用处的废纸了。因此，我们这次大刀阔斧地精简了运输规章制度。新运输规章只有两个对外的规程（客规和货规）和三个内部作业规则，一共不到十五万字，比旧规章减少了百分之九十。新规章试行以来，广大旅客、物资托运单位和铁路基层职工都很满意。
    规章制度对生产起到促进作用
    通过这次改革运输规章制度，我们深深体会到：规章制度对于人们的生产实践是有很大影响的。许多事实证明，由于旧运输规章制度中有不少是从铁路的局部利益出发规定的，有不少是脱离生产实践的内容的，这就助长了我们在铁路运输工作中的本位主义和官僚主义，妨碍了铁路更好地为生产、为人民服务。新的运输规章制度革除了本位主义和官僚主义的旧规定，增强了服务观点和全局观点，处处从便利旅客和物资托运单位出发，简化了运输手续，提高了服务质量。由于新规章的指导思想明确，试行以来虽然将及半年，但全路已经出现了基层单位、职工群众主动为旅客服务、为企业部门服务的许多好人好事。
    规章制度是人们在一定时期，对于客观事物的认识的反映，而客观事物总是不断变化着发展着的。正因为如此，我们对于改革规章制度决不能抱一劳永逸的态度，必须按照毛主席的指示，通过实践——认识——再实践——再认识的循环往复的过程，使我们的思想经常能够适应客观的变化情况，自觉地改造主观世界，不断地改革规章制度，使之正确地反映客观的生产实践，才能把铁路运输工作做得更加出色。
