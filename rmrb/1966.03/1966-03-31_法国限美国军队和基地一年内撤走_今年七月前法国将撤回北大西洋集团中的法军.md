    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 30th - France presented a new note to the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the 29th, stating that France is prepared to withdraw French officers and troops from the military institutions of the group before July this year.

    France also suggested a one-year timeframe for the withdrawal of approximately 30,000 American soldiers, nine U.S. Air Force bases, and forty military facilities from French territory. In addition, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and the Headquarters Allied Forces Central Europe must also be moved at the same time. This is the first concrete action taken by France, in its formal proposal to the Allies, regarding the timetable for the withdrawal of American troops and bases from France, and France's preparation to withdraw officers and troops from the military "integration" agencies of the Atlantic group. This action is to fulfill its decision of March 7th to sever relations with the military system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by the United States.

    Prior to this, U.S. President Johnson had exerted pressure on France in various ways, attempting to force France to change its mind. In his reply to De Gaulle on March 22nd, Johnson emphasized the necessity of military "integration" and "mutual dependence" among member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, expressed his "bewilderment at De Gaulle's opinion that the stationing of allied military forces on French territory undermined French sovereignty," and believed that "their stationing is a wise and farsighted application of French sovereignty." On the 23rd, Johnson, in a speech at the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State, again expressed his determination to "maintain and strengthen the deterrent force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" together with other allies. On the 25th, the United States again sent a note to France, asking France to "further clarify its policies" so that the United States could "consult with other allies."

    However, French Prime Minister Pompidou reaffirmed France's determination to withdraw from the "integrated" organization of the North Atlantic group in a televised speech on the 28th. He said that this "integration" might involve France "in a conflict that has nothing to do with either Europe or the North Atlantic." On the afternoon of the 29th, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, West Germany, and Italy and delivered the aforementioned note. On the 30th, France also delivered the same note to other allies.

    France's new actions have thrown U.S. officials into a flurry of activity. General Lemnitzer, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (who is also Commander-in-Chief of U.S. forces in Europe), hurriedly left for the United States on the 29th, intending to spend two weeks discussing matters related to the withdrawal. On the same day, U.S. Under Secretary of State Ball convened a fourteen-nation meeting of other allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Paris, without France's participation, once again attempting to mobilize the strength of the fourteen nations to oppose France. According to Agence France-Presse, Ball raised the issues of "whether France's actions are legal," the military consequences of France's withdrawal, and who would bear the financial expenses. United Press International reported that Ball "described Washington's views on the entire issue to the allies." However, French commentator Tabouis wrote in *Le Parisien Libéré*: "Since nothing can make France change its decision, it is no longer effective to threaten France and attempt to mobilize France's European partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against France."

### 法国限美国军队和基地一年内撤走  今年七月前法国将撤回北大西洋集团中的法军

    法国限美国军队和基地一年内撤走
    今年七月前法国将撤回北大西洋集团中的法军
    新华社三十日讯  巴黎消息：法国二十九日向北大西洋集团成员国提出一份新照会，表示法国准备在今年七月以前撤退这个集团军事机构中的法国军官和军队。
    法国还建议给一年的时限让大约三万美军、九个美国空军基地和四十个军事设施撤离法国领土。此外，欧洲盟军最高司令部和中欧盟军司令部也须在同时迁走。这是法国正式向盟国提出的关于美国军队和基地撤离法国以及法国准备从大西洋集团的军事“一体化”机构撤回军官和军队的时间表。这是法国为履行其三月七日的决定、同美国控制的北大西洋公约组织军事体系断绝关系的第一个具体行动。
    在此以前，美国总统约翰逊曾经通过种种方式对法国施加压力，想迫使法国回心转意。三月二十二日，约翰逊在给戴高乐的复信中，强调北大西洋公约组织成员国之间实行军事“一体化”和“互相依赖”的必要性，表示对戴高乐提出的“盟国军事力量驻扎在法国领土上有损法国主权的意见感到迷惑不解”，并且认为“它们的驻扎是明智和高瞻远瞩地运用法国的主权”。二十三日，约翰逊在美国国务院外交学院发表演说时，又表示要决心同其他盟国一起来“维护和加强北大西洋公约组织的威慑力量”。二十五日，美国又给法国照会，要法国“进一步阐明政策”，以便美国“同其他盟国磋商”。
    然而，法国总理蓬皮杜二十八日通过电视讲话重申法国要退出北大西洋集团“一体化”组织的决心。他说，因为这种“一体化”可能会把法国“卷入一场既同欧洲无关、又同北大西洋无关的冲突中去”。二十九日下午，法国外交部召见美、英、西德、意大利四国外交代表，递交了上述内容的照会。三十日，法国又把同样的照会交给了其他盟国。
    法国的新行动又使美国官员陷于一阵手忙脚乱之中。北大西洋公约组织驻欧部队最高司令兰尼兹尔（他也是驻欧美军司令）二十九日赶紧动身回美国，打算用两周时间商谈有关撤退的事宜。同一天，美国副国务卿鲍尔在巴黎召集北大西洋公约组织其他盟国代表举行了没有法国参加的十四国会议，再一次企图动员十四国力量来反对法国。据法新社报道，鲍尔在会上提出了法国行动“是否合法”、法国退出的军事后果以及谁负担财政开支的问题。合众国际社消息说，鲍尔“向盟国叙述了华盛顿对整个问题的看法”。但是，法国评论员塔布伊在《今日巴黎报》上写道：“既然没有任何东西能使法国改变自己的决定，因此，要威胁法国和企图动员法国的北大西洋公约组织欧洲伙伴起来反对法国，就不再有效了。”
