    Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the people, becomes an incomparably enormous force. In leading agricultural production, the Huang County Party Committee earnestly studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, first using Mao Zedong Thought to solve some important problems in the ideological and work style of the county committee leadership, and then using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses and mobilize their enthusiasm. In this way, they achieved one victory after another in the struggle to transform heaven and earth.

    The thoroughly revolutionary proletarian worldview is established and consolidated in struggle. In the process of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the comrades of the Huang County Party Committee vigorously destroyed bourgeois ideology, vigorously established proletarian ideology, and waged a serious struggle against the ideology of "passive maintenance of the status quo." They overcame a sense of "complacency," discarded a sense of "self," eliminated a sense of "fear," and broke away from a sense of "reliance," implementing the policy of self-reliance and eliminating the idea of relying on the state. With a thoroughly revolutionary spirit, they changed the spiritual outlook of the county committee, improved the ideological style of the county committee, and greatly promoted the production revolution movement throughout the county.

    Once the worldview problem is solved, it becomes easier to solve the methodological problem. The Huang County Party Committee firmly grasped the core of materialist dialectics—the law of the unity of opposites—to guide their practice. When encountering problems, they were able to conduct specific analyses and constantly sum up experiences and lessons from the perspective of dividing one into two. Therefore, their ideas, plans, and measures for leading the production struggle could be more in line with objective reality.

    They dialectically recognized the relationship between internal and external causes of things, overcoming the one-sidedness of past observations. When there were achievements, they not only emphasized internal causes but also saw the objective favorable conditions; when encountering natural disasters, they not only saw external causes but also examined the subjective reasons. They emphasized the human factor, striving to bring into play the subjective initiative of people, fully utilizing favorable conditions, and changing unfavorable conditions.

    They properly resolved the contradiction between long-term construction and current production, both grasping basic farmland construction to gradually transform the local natural conditions fundamentally, and arranging labor according to the specific conditions of different seasons to solve the current urgent production problems.

    They learned to correctly handle the relationship between heat and cold, first being promoters, fully mobilizing the masses, and greatly boosting revolutionary vigor; and also maintaining a clear head, seeking truth from facts to solve problems. They had a scientific attitude, and the plans they formulated were positive, prudent, and reliable; they closely watched the progress of the movement, promptly discovered problems, grasped the proper timing, protected the enthusiasm of the masses, and rationally resolved the relationship between the long-term interests and the immediate interests of the masses.

    They appropriately treated advanced units and backward units, both going to the advanced Xiadingjia Brigade to truly understand that to promote specific experiences in increasing production, it is first necessary to spread the revolutionary spirit; and also going to backward units to analyze the reasons for backwardness and help backward units catch up with the advanced.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "'Why should people not regard these oppositions as dead, rigid things, but as living, conditioned, mobile, and mutually transforming things?' Because objective things are inherently so." It was precisely by using materialist dialectics and opposing metaphysics that the Huang County Party Committee achieved effective leadership over the county's production struggle.

    Matter transforms into spirit, and spirit can also transform into matter. The Huang County Party Committee studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, understood the principles of thorough revolution and passive maintenance of the status quo, internal and external causes, major and minor contradictions, and so on, and used these principles to arm the cadres and the masses. Once the masses were of one heart, things became easier to handle. Once Mao Zedong Thought was grasped by the masses, it generated tremendous material strength, promoting the production and construction movement throughout the county, both vigorously and solidly.

    The purpose of the Huang County Party Committee's study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works was very clear: to use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of the three great revolutionary movements in Huang County. They worked hard to focus on the word "use." Their study had no trace of dogmatism; they always first raised questions, studied Comrade Mao Zedong's relevant works with these questions in mind, and sought the guiding ideology and working methods for solving problems. They used what they learned immediately, and it was truly effective.

    The Huang County Party Committee's experience in studying and applying materialist dialectics to guide the production struggle once again proved that only by working hard on the word "use" can we truly learn Mao Zedong Thought and fully exert the power of Mao Zedong Thought. Party leading organs at all levels must strive to creatively study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, give full play to the leading role of the proletariat, and exert the greatest combat power!

    最大的战斗力
    毛泽东思想一旦被人们掌握，就会成为无比巨大的力量。黄县县委在领导农业生产的过程中，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，先用毛泽东思想解决了县委领导思想和工作作风方面的一些重要问题，又用毛泽东思想武装群众，调动了广大群众的积极性。这样，他们就在改天换地的斗争中，取得了一个又一个的胜利 。
    彻底革命的无产阶级世界观，是在斗争中建立和巩固起来的。黄县县委的同志们，在学习毛泽东同志著作的过程中，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，同“消极守业”思想进行了严重的斗争。他们克服了一个“满”字，丢掉了一个“我”字，打掉了一个“怕”字，摆脱了一个“靠”字，贯彻了自力更生的方针，破除了依赖国家的思想。他们用彻底革命的精神，改变了县委的精神面貌，改进了县委的思想作风，大大促进了全县的生产革命运动。
    解决了世界观问题，也就比较容易解决方法论问题。黄县县委牢牢抓住唯物辩证法的核心——对立统一的法则，指导自己的实践。他们遇到问题，能进行具体分析，不断以一分为二的观点，总结经验教训。因而，他们领导生产斗争的思想、计划和措施，就能比较地符合客观实际。
    他们辩证地认识到事物内因和外因的关系，克服了过去观察问题的片面性。有了成绩，不只强调内因，同时看到客观的有利条件；遇到自然灾害，不只看到外因，同时检查主观上的原因。他们强调人的因素，努力发挥人的主观能动性，充分利用有利条件，改变不利条件。
    他们妥善地解决了长远建设同当年生产的矛盾，既抓农田基本建设，逐步从根本上改造当地的自然条件；同时按照不同季节的具体情况，安排劳力，解决当前的迫切生产问题。
    他们学会了正确处理热与冷的关系，首先是当促进派，充分发动群众，大鼓革命干劲；又能保持清醒的头脑，实事求是地解决问题。他们有科学的态度，制定的计划是积极的、稳妥的、可靠的；他们密切注视运动的进程，及时发现问题，掌握火候，保护群众的积极性，合理解决群众的长远利益和眼前利益的关系。
    他们恰当地对待先进单位和后进单位，既到先进的下丁家大队蹲点，真正懂得了推广具体的增产经验，必须首先传播革命精神；又到后进单位蹲点，分析后进原因，帮助后进单位赶超先进。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“‘为什么人的头脑不应当把这些对立看作死的、凝固的东西，而应当看作生动的、有条件的、可变动的、互相转化的东西’呢？因为客观事物本来是如此的。”黄县县委正是运用了唯物辩证法，反对了形而上学，对全县的生产斗争实现了有力的领导。
    物质变精神，精神又可以变物质。黄县县委学习了毛泽东同志的著作，认识了彻底革命和消极守业、内因和外因、主要矛盾和次要矛盾等等道理，用这些道理把干部和群众武装起来，群众就齐心了，事情就好办了。毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量，推动了全县的生产建设运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    黄县县委学习毛泽东同志著作的目的，是十分明确的：用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射黄县三大革命运动之“的”。他们努力在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们的学习没有教条主义气味，总是先提出问题，带着问题学习毛泽东同志的有关著作，寻找解决问题的指导思想和工作方法。他们学了就用，真是立竿见影。
    黄县县委学习和运用唯物辩证法指导生产斗争的体会，又一次证明了，只有在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能真正学到毛泽东思想，才能充分发挥毛泽东思想的威力。各级党的领导机关，要努力活学活用毛泽东同志著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，充分发挥无产阶级的领导作用，发挥最大的战斗力！
