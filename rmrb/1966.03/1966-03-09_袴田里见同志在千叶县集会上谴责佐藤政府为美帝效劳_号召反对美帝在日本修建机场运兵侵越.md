    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th—Hakama Rimi, member of the Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee, exposed at a mass rally in Tomisato Village, Chiba Prefecture, on the 6th, that American imperialism is using Tokyo’s Haneda Airport to transport large numbers of American invading troops to South Vietnam. He called on the Japanese people to rise up and oppose the Sato government's plot to build a new "international airport" in Tokyo to serve the expansion of the war of aggression by the United States.

    On the afternoon of the 6th, three thousand Japanese people held a protest rally and demonstration march near Tomisato Village, Chiba Prefecture, where the Sato government plans to build a new "international airport."

    At the rally, Hakama Rimi revealed that as the United States expands its war of aggression against Vietnam, at least 80 to 100 aircraft of the American "Northwest Airlines" and "Flying Tiger Airlines" transport large numbers of American troops invading Vietnam to Haneda Airport every month, and then transport them to South Vietnam via Okinawa or Manila. Currently, about 13,000 American troops invading Vietnam are transferred through Tokyo's Haneda Airport to South Vietnam every month. After arriving at Haneda, they are strictly prohibited from leaving the airport for fear of exposing the truth of the troop transport.

    Hakama said that the Sato government has recently been desperately clamoring, saying that Haneda Airport, as a civil international airport, is too "small" and cannot meet the needs, attempting to blame the recent series of accidents involving passenger planes of Japanese and some foreign airlines on the fact that Haneda Airport is "small." Hakama pointed out that this is a complete lie of the Sato government. The real reason why Haneda Airport is "small" is that the United States is using it militarily to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the accident in which an All Nippon Airways plane crashed into the sea when landing in Tokyo Bay on February 4, causing a major tragedy, was because it was affected by the priority landing of three American military aircraft at the time.

    Hakama said that the Sato government is now using the excuse that Haneda Airport is "small" to plot to seize farmers' land in Tomisato to build a new large-scale "international airport." This is to serve the United States' expansion of its war of aggression against Vietnam according to the will of American imperialism.

    Hakama called on the masses present and all democratic forces to unite, persist in the struggle, and resolutely oppose the Sato government's plot to build a so-called "international airport" for aggressive purposes under the direction of American imperialism.

    The protest rally was jointly organized by the Anti-Construction of "International Airport" Alliance of Tomisato Village and Yachimata Town in Chiba Prefecture, and the Chiba Prefecture Implementation Committee for Demanding the Abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." In addition to the local farmers, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Tokyo, Saitama Prefecture, and Gunma Prefecture also rushed to participate in the rally, expressing their firm support for the farmers' struggle. The masses attending the meeting held signs in their hands, wore headbands indicating their determination to fight, and wore ribbons with slogans such as "Resolutely oppose the construction of a new airport!" on their shoulders. The emotions were extremely激昂. The local masses also specially built a "Unity Hut" and a lookout tower at the entrance of the village of Yachimata Town to closely monitor the personnel who attempted to forcibly build the "international airport" from breaking into the village.

    Participants in the rally included Nishizawa Tomio, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Taniguchi Zentaro, member of the Diet of the Japanese Communist Party, Ogawa Mitsuo, member of the Diet of the Socialist Party, and Hori Makoto, secretary-general of the Central Implementation Committee for Demanding the Abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and Implementing Various Demands.

    The rally unanimously adopted a declaration of struggle expressing resolute opposition to the construction of the airport. After the meeting, the masses braved the severe cold and rain and snow to hold a demonstration march. The march was enthusiastically encouraged and welcomed by people along the way.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, the Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper, *Akahata*, published an article on February 26, condemning the Sato government for adapting to the needs of the United States' expanding war of aggression and placing Japan under the American "nuclear umbrella."

    *Akahata* pointed out that at a time when the U.S. attempt to turn Japan into a nuclear base has become apparent, especially after the Honolulu Conference when the U.S. has stepped up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the issuance of a "unified view" on the "nuclear umbrella" issue, openly admitting that Japan has joined the U.S. (aimed at attacking China) "nuclear strategic system," is particularly noteworthy.

    *Akahata* said that in fact, Japan has become a base for the United States to prepare for a nuclear war and an accomplice in assisting the United States in carrying out nuclear blackmail. Japanese Prime Minister Sato also recently stated: "According to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are allowed to dock in Sasebo or Yokosuka."

    Matsuno Raizo, director-general of the Japan "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Minister of Defense), openly admitted at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 39th: "The third expansion plan that began this year is aimed at China. It has 'flexibility' and can 'cope with all changes.'"

    袴田里见同志在千叶县集会上谴责佐藤政府为美帝效劳
    号召反对美帝在日本修建机场运兵侵越
    新华社东京七日电  日共中央政治局委员袴田里见六日在千叶县富里村群众大会上揭露美帝国主义利用东京羽田机场向南越大批运送美国侵略军，号召日本人民起来反对佐藤政府在东京新建一个为美国扩大侵略战争服务的“国际飞机场”的阴谋。
    六日下午，有三千名日本群众在佐藤政府准备新建“国际机场”的千叶县富里村附近举行抗议大会和示威游行。
    袴田里见在大会上揭露，随着美国扩大侵略越南战争，每月至少有八十架到一百架美国“西北航空公司”和“飞虎航空公司”的飞机把大批侵越美军运到羽田机场，然后再经过冲绳或马尼拉运往南越。现在，每月经东京羽田机场转往南越的侵越美军约有一万三千多人。他们到达羽田后，由于害怕暴露运兵真相，被严禁离开机场。
    袴田说，佐藤政府最近拼命地叫嚷，说什么作为民用国际机场的羽田机场已经太“小”，不能满足需要，企图把最近日本和一些外国民航公司的客机接连失事的责任推到羽田机场“小”这一点上。袴田指出，这是佐藤政府的弥天大谎。羽田机场“小”的真正原因，是美国在军事上利用它扩大侵略越南战争。他说，二月四日全日本航空公司的飞机在东京湾降落时失事，坠入海中造成重大惨案，就是因为当时受到三架美国军用飞机优先降落的影响。
    袴田说，佐藤政府现在借口羽田机场“小”，阴谋霸占农民土地在富里修建一个新的大规模的“国际机场”，这是按照美帝国主义的意旨，为美国扩大侵略越南战争效劳。
    袴田号召与会群众和一切民主力量团结起来，坚持斗争，坚决反对佐藤政府在美帝国主义的指使下修建为侵略目的服务的所谓“国际机场”的阴谋。
    抗议大会是由千叶县富里村和八街町的反对修建“国际机场”同盟、要求废除日美“安全条约”千叶县实行委员会联合主办的。参加大会的除了当地的农民外，东京都、埼玉县和群马县的各阶层人民一千多人也赶来参加了大会，表示他们坚决支持农民的斗争。与会群众手里举着标语牌，头上扎着表示斗争决心的手巾，肩上挂着写有“坚决反对修建新机场！”口号的布带。情绪极为激昂。当地群众还特地在八街町的村子口修建了一个“团结小屋”和了望台，以严密监视企图强行修建“国际机场”的人员闯进村里。
    参加大会的有日共中央政治局候补委员西泽富夫、日共国会议员谷口善太郎、社会党国会议员小川三男和要求废除日美“安全条约”、贯彻各项要求中央实行委员会事务局长堀真琴等人。
    大会一致通过了表示坚决反对修建机场的斗争宣言。会后，群众冒着严寒和雨雪举行了示威游行。游行队伍沿路受到人们的热情鼓励和欢迎。
    据新华社东京电  日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》二月二十六日发表文章，谴责佐藤政府正在适应美国扩大侵略战争的需要，把日本置于美国“核保护伞”之下。
    《赤旗报》指出，佐藤政府在美国使日本变成核基地的企图已经表面化的时候，特别是在檀香山会议后美国加紧推行扩大侵略越南战争的时候，发表关于“核保护伞”问题的“统一见解”，公开承认日本已经参加美国（以攻击中国为目的）的“核战略体制”，这一点特别值得重视。
    《赤旗报》说，事实上日本已经成为美国准备发动核战争的基地和协助美国进行核讹诈的帮凶。日本首相佐藤最近也表示：“根据美日安全条约，美国核动力航空母舰，不论是在佐世保、还是在横须贺停泊都是被允许的。”
    日本“防卫厅”长官（相当于国防部长）松野赖三十九日在众议院预算委员会公开承认：“从今年开始的第三次扩军计划是针对中国的，它具有‘伸缩性’，可以‘应付一切变化’。”
