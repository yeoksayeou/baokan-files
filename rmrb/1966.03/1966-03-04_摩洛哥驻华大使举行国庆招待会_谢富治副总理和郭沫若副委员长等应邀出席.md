    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd – The Ambassador of the Kingdom of Morocco to China, Abdellatif Filali, held a reception at the embassy this evening to celebrate the National Day of the Kingdom of Morocco.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Cai Tingkai, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng and others were invited to attend the reception.

    Ambassador Abdellatif Filali spoke at the reception. He spoke about Morocco's achievements in politics, economics, and culture, as well as Morocco's foreign policy. He said that in international relations, our policy is to respect each other's dignity and freedom, friendly cooperation, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and peaceful resolution of international disputes. The Ambassador said that the relationship between People's China and Morocco is friendly and very long-standing. We are very pleased to see that Sino-Moroccan relations are developing and consolidating further today, especially in trade that benefits both parties.

    Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi spoke at the reception. He praised the Kingdom of Morocco, under the leadership of King Hassan II, for pursuing a policy of peace, neutrality, and non-alignment, advocating friendly relations with Asian and African countries, and making contributions to promoting Asian-African solidarity and safeguarding world peace. He said that China and Morocco are two friendly countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1958, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, the people of our two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other.

    Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi said that the Chinese government and people have always supported the just struggle of Morocco and all Arab people, and supported all anti-imperialist revolutionary causes of the people of the world. The anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries in the world is indivisible. As long as all countries and peoples who are invaded and oppressed unite, support each other, and fight together, they can completely shatter the aggression and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States. We believe that in the common struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, for promoting Asian-African solidarity and defending world peace, the friendship between the Chinese and Moroccan peoples, and the friendship between the Chinese people and the Arab peoples, will surely be consolidated and developed day by day.

    Also invited to attend the reception were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, as well as responsible persons from other relevant departments.

    Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.
