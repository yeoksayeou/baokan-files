    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, March 28th -- Pakistani newspapers have published editorials warmly praising the friendship between China and Pakistan and condemning imperialist attempts to undermine relations between the two countries.

    The *Mountain Star* published an editorial on the 28th pointing out that imperialists have created a very serious situation, particularly in Asia. They want to turn Asia into a battlefield to realize their own expansionist and colonialist goals. Therefore, they regard the friendly relations between Pakistan and China as an obstacle to them. The editorial emphasized that we should always be vigilant against their conspiracies in order to deal with any possible situation.

    The editorial said: "We must make it clear that we will not allow any country to interfere in our internal affairs, thereby damaging our national dignity and honor. We are very clear about what is in our national interest and what is not. We can in no way abandon our relations with such a great and cordial country as China."

    *Construction News*'s editorial on the 28th said: "Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit not only strengthened the eternal friendship between China and Pakistan, but also dispelled rumors spread by certain imperialist agents about the so-called reversal of Sino-Pakistani relations and Pakistan's return to the imperialist camp."

    The *Eastern Examiner* weekly of Chittagong said in an editorial on the 26th that the very profound friendship between the people of China and Pakistan, which has grown steadily in the past few years, will be further developed during the visit of the two countries' leaders. The editorial said that as Pakistan became a free country and the People's Republic of China was liberated from the shackles of imperialism and reactionaries, this historic friendship has been even more greatly promoted.

    The editorial concluded: "During Chairman Liu Shaoqi's most welcome visit, not only will the people of the two countries draw closer together, but the cause of world peace will also be strengthened by establishing a zone of peace in this region."

    巴基斯坦报刊谴责帝国主义企图破坏巴中关系
    刘主席的访问加强了巴中人民永恒友谊
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十八日电  巴基斯坦各报发表社论，热烈赞扬中巴两国的友谊，谴责帝国主义企图破坏巴中两国的关系。
    《山岳报》二十八日发表社论指出，帝国主义者特别在亚洲制造了非常严重的局势，他们想把亚洲变成战场，来实现他们自己的扩张主义和殖民主义的目的。因此，他们把巴中两国的友好关系看作是对他们的一个障碍。社论强调说，我们应当对他们的阴谋经常保持警惕，以便对付可能发生的任何情况。
    社论说：“我们要毫不含糊地表明，我们不容许任何国家干涉我国的内部事务，从而损害我们的民族尊严和荣誉。我们非常清楚，什么是我们的民族利益，什么不是我们的民族利益。我们无论如何都不能抛弃我们同中国这样一个伟大亲切的国家的关系。”
    《建设报》二十八日的社论说：“刘少奇主席的这次访问不仅加强了中巴两国的永恒友谊，而且扫清了某些帝国主义代理人散布的所谓巴中关系逆转和巴基斯坦又转向帝国主义阵营的谣言。”
    吉大港的《东方考察家》周刊二十六日的社论说，在过去几年中不断增长的中巴两国人民十分深厚的友谊将在两国领袖的访问中得到新的发展。社论说，随着巴基斯坦成为一个自由的国家，中华人民共和国从帝国主义和反动派的桎梏下解放出来，这种历史性的友谊更加发扬光大了。
    社论最后说：“在刘少奇主席这次最受欢迎的访问中，不仅两国人民将靠拢得更加紧密，而且将由于在这个地区建立一个和平区域而使世界和平事业得到加强。”
