    Japanese Peace Fighters Rally in Shizuoka to Commemorate Bikini Day on March 1st
    Condemn US Aggression Against Vietnam and "Containment" of China
    Prince Souphanouvong Supports Japanese People's Opposition to US Nuclear War Policy
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 1st) A national conference of 3,600 Japanese peace fighters, "Oppose the War of Aggression Against Vietnam, Stop Nuclear War, Completely Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, and Aid Atomic Bomb Victims," was held in Shizuoka City on the afternoon of the 1st to commemorate Bikini Day on March 1st.

    The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikyo), which organized the national conference, submitted a report to the conference stating that as US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam gradually escalates, the danger of fighting a nuclear war is increasing in Asia, and the situation in Asia has entered a new stage. The report condemned the Japanese government for supporting US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

    The report condemned US imperialism for attempting to drag more countries into its nuclear military alliance under the pretext of guaranteeing the "security" of non-nuclear countries and for pursuing a policy of "containment" against China.

    The report proposed that the following be listed as tasks of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs: demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, dismantling military bases in Japan, opposing the US nuclear strategy system in the Asia-Pacific region, completely prohibiting the use, testing, manufacturing, and storage of nuclear weapons, opposing Japan's nuclear armament, striving to regain Okinawa and Ogasawara, and strengthening joint struggles with the people of the world.

    On the first day of the "National Conference," many peace fighters also gathered at forty venues in Shizuoka City and Yaizu City to discuss the current situation and the tasks of the Japanese peace fighters' struggle.

    On the morning of the 1st, a solemn memorial ceremony was held at the grave of Aikichi Kuboyama, a victim of the Bikini incident in Yaizu City.

    When the representative of the Japanese Communist Party took an oath at the grave, he emphasized that today is a day to once again express determination to oppose aggression against Vietnam and strive for the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. All democratic forces should unite to fight for Japan's independence and peace and against US imperialism.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, March 1st) According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent a telegram to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on February 25th, stating that the Lao people are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese people against the common enemy of the people of the world—US imperialism's aggression.

    In his telegram congratulating the Japanese "March 1st Bikini Day National Conference," Prince Souphanouvong said that the Lao people are convinced that this conference will further promote the Japanese people's struggle to defend national independence, shatter US imperialism's attempt to turn Japan into a military base for aggression against Asia, and the conspiracy to turn Japan into a nuclear base.
