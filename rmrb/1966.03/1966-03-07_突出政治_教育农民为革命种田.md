    Emphasize Politics, Educate Peasants to Farm for the Revolution
    Hubei Provincial Rural Work Conference pointed out: It is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, grasp class struggle and the struggle between two roads, realize the revolutionization of leadership above the county committee level, boost the enthusiasm of the masses from both political and ideological education and caring for the lives of the masses, boost enthusiasm according to the Party's policies, and combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic spirit.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th dispatch) The Hubei Provincial Party Committee recently convened a provincial rural work conference, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and correctly solved the problem of politics commanding economics, business, and technology. The conference called on Party organizations at all levels throughout the province to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, grasp the three great revolutions simultaneously, and under the unified planning and leadership of the state, boldly mobilize the masses, go all out, aim high, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    More than 400 people attended this conference, including secretaries or deputy secretaries of the Party committees of various districts, cities, and counties, commissioners or deputy commissioners, county heads or deputy county heads, and other rural work cadres. The comrades attending the meeting conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works on political work and the relevant instructions of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and used the method of "one divides into two" to summarize the rural political work in the province in recent years. Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, made an important speech at the meeting.
    After discussion, the conference considered that emphasizing politics means taking Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and grasping the struggle between the two classes and the two roads. This is the only guarantee for carrying the socialist revolution through to the end and successfully completing socialist construction.
    The conference particularly emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest instruction for all our work, and the guide for us to observe and handle all problems. If we do not study Chairman Mao's works and do not take Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, bourgeois ideology will be the commander. The comrades attending the meeting recalled the development process of the revolutionary history. No matter which period, which region, or which department, wherever Mao Zedong Thought was well commanded and the main contradiction of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads was grasped, the work and production were good; wherever Mao Zedong Thought was poorly commanded and class struggle was not vigorously grasped, the work and production were poor. Since the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Party organizations at all levels in Hubei Province have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasped the main contradiction of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, learned from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, and conscientiously implemented the Party's various policies, thereby fully mobilizing the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the vast number of cadres and commune members, and have achieved great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction, with the province achieving bumper harvests for three consecutive years.
    The conference considered that although rural political work has been strengthened, it has not been fully achieved to put political work in the first place of all work, and not enough effort has been put into the application of creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Many comrades are still unclear about the significance of emphasizing politics and have not correctly placed the positions of politics and production. They still talk about production in terms of production, and are very interested in production progress and fertilizer accumulation figures, but not very interested in class struggle and the ideological problems of Party members, cadres, and the people. Therefore, it is still necessary to further improve the consciousness of all comrades and reduce blindness in correctly handling the relationship between politics and economy, and business.
    The conference considered that the relationship between politics and production is a unity of opposites. Generally speaking, politics serves the economic base and is the superstructure. At the same time, politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. However, it must not be simplified into "politics serves production" or "production is the end, and politics is the means." The ultimate goal of us communists is to build our country into a strong socialist country and move towards communism; at the same time, we actively support the world revolution and strive to realize communism throughout the world. Our insistence on putting politics in command and carrying out economic construction is all to achieve this goal. To lead agricultural production, it is necessary to constantly educate the broad masses with this goal, so that they consciously farm for the revolution. People are the decisive factor in the development of production. Only when the broad masses truly understand the revolutionary significance of doing a good job in production, and fully exert their subjective initiative under certain conditions, can any difficulty be overcome, and revolutionary spirit can be transformed into material strength.
    The conference considered that while putting political work in the first place and educating peasants to farm for the revolution, it is also necessary to implement the socialist principles of distribution according to work and exchange at equal value, and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The conference required Party organizations at all levels and all Party members and cadres throughout the province to boost the enthusiasm of the masses from both political and ideological education and caring for the lives of the masses, to boost enthusiasm according to the Party's policies, and to be good at combining revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic spirit.
    How can we emphasize politics? Everyone believes that the primary issue is the revolutionization of leadership above the county committee level. The fundamental issue of leadership revolutionization is to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to learn with ideological problems in mind, to learn with work problems in mind, to transform thinking, and to improve work. During the conference, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee organized the comrades attending the conference to study the revolutionary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu and the experience of the Xiangyuan County Party Committee of Shanxi Province in "open-door revolution" published in the *People's Daily*, and, like Lankao and Xiangyuan, strived to solve the problem of the revolutionization of county committee leadership.
    What should the Party committee focus on when grasping political and ideological work? The comrades attending the conference believed that it is necessary to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and grasp "five things that must not be forgotten," namely, not forgetting class struggle, not forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, not forgetting relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, not forgetting the Party's policies, and not forgetting the Party's work. In the future, if any unit fails to do a good job in production, the reasons should first be sought from these five aspects. Of course, there are also technical reasons for backwardness in production; however, as long as these five aspects are resolved and the enthusiasm of the broad masses is brought into play, technical problems can be better resolved.
    The conference considered that emphasizing politics requires further improvement of the leadership style and leadership methods of Party committees at all levels. At this meeting, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee summarized and promoted the ten-character leadership method of Xiaogan County: "duty, squatting, labor, learning, democracy." The so-called duty means that the main leading members of the Party committees at all levels from the county, district, commune to the brigade branch committee take turns on duty to be responsible for handling the daily work of the committee, and those who are not on duty go down to squat. Those who squat and those who are on duty participate in labor, conduct investigation and research, and scientific experiments; they must study Chairman Mao's works; and in handling everything, they must promote democracy and consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, first democracy, then concentration. Everyone believes that this is conducive to giving full play to the role of government departments, enabling the Party committee to get rid of affairs and concentrate its efforts on grasping political work; and it is conducive to overcoming bureaucracy and realizing the combination of leadership and the masses.
    The conference also discussed the issue of striving for a greater harvest in agricultural production this year. The conference required Party committees at all levels throughout the province to educate the broad masses of cadres and commune members to link doing a good job in production in their own region and unit with the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan, and with supporting national construction and supporting the world revolution. Further carry out the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, put great effort into the application of what is learned, realize the revolutionization of leadership, and the revolutionization of the masses. Leading cadres at all levels must adhere to running "three-way combination" model fields well, adhere to the style of the mass line, boldly mobilize the masses, implement production plans, and vigorously grasp the implementation of measures and hard technologies. At the same time, it is necessary to insert red flags and set up pace-setters, and carry out a mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing throughout the province with the goal of "five goods," and concretely implement the emphasis on politics in the struggle to carry out the "five goods" movement and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

### 突出政治　教育农民为革命种田

    突出政治　教育农民为革命种田
    湖北省农村工作会议指出：要用毛泽东思想挂帅，抓紧阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，实现县委以上领导革命化，从政治思想教育和关心群众生活两方面来鼓群众的干劲，按照党的政策鼓干劲，把革命热情和求实精神结合起来。
    据新华社武汉六日电　中共湖北省委最近召开的全省农村工作会议，活学活用毛主席著作，正确解决政治统帅经济、业务、技术的问题。会议号召全省各级党组织高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，三大革命一起抓，在国家统一计划、统一领导下，放手发动群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    参加这次会议的有各地、市、县委书记或副书记，专员或副专员，县长或副县长以及其他农村工作干部共四百多人。到会同志认真学习了毛主席有关政治工作的著作和中共中央中南局、湖北省委的有关指示，用一分为二的方法，总结了近几年全省农村政治工作。中共湖北省委第一书记王任重在会上作了重要讲话。
    会议经过讨论认为，突出政治，就是要以毛泽东思想挂帅，抓住两个阶级和两条道路的斗争。这是将社会主义革命进行到底，社会主义建设胜利完成的唯一保证。
    会议特别强调指出：毛泽东思想，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是我们进行一切工作的最高指示，也是我们观察和处理一切问题的指南。不学习毛主席著作，不以毛泽东思想挂帅，资产阶级思想就会挂帅。与会同志回忆了革命历史的发展经过，不论哪个时期、哪个地区、哪个部门，凡是毛泽东思想挂帅好的，抓住了阶级斗争和两条道路斗争这个主要矛盾，工作和生产就好；凡是毛泽东思想挂帅差的，阶级斗争抓得不力，工作和生产就差。从党的八届十中全会以来，湖北省各级党组织高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓住阶级斗争和两条道路斗争这个主要矛盾，学习解放军政治工作经验，认真贯彻执行党的各项方针政策，因而充分调动了广大干部、社员的政治热情和生产积极性，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设上取得了巨大成就，全省连续三年获得丰收。
    会议认为，尽管农村政治工作有了加强，但是还没有完全做到把政治工作放在一切工作的首位，对活学活用毛主席著作，还没有在用字上狠下功夫。还有许多同志对突出政治的意义模糊不清，没有把政治与生产的位置摆正。他们还是就生产论生产，对生产进度、积肥数字很感兴趣，而对阶级斗争，对党员、干部和人民群众的思想问题，兴趣不大。因此，还必须在正确处理政治与经济、业务的关系上，进一步提高全体同志的自觉性，减少盲目性。
    会议认为，政治与生产的关系是对立的统一。一般来讲，政治是为经济基础服务的，是上层建筑。同时，政治又是经济的集中表现。但是，绝对不能简单化成“政治为生产服务”、“生产是目的，政治是手段”。我们共产党人的最终目的是要把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，走向共产主义；同时，积极支援世界革命，为在全世界实现共产主义而奋斗。我们坚持政治挂帅，进行经济建设，都是为了实现这个目的。领导农业生产，就要时时刻刻用这个目的来教育广大群众，使他们自觉地为革命种田。人是发展生产中起决定作用的因素。只有让广大群众真正懂得了搞好生产的革命意义，在一定的条件下充分发挥了主观能动作用，任何困难都可以战胜，革命精神就能变成物质力量。
    会议认为，把政治工作摆在第一位，教育农民为革命种田，同时必须实行按劳分配、等价交换的社会主义原则，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系。会议要求全省各级党组织和全体党员、干部，要从政治思想教育和关心群众生活这两个方面来鼓群众的干劲，要按照党的政策鼓干劲，要善于把革命热情和求实精神结合起来。
    怎样才能突出政治？大家认为，首要的问题是县委以上领导革命化。而领导革命化的根本问题，是活学活用毛主席著作，要带着思想上的问题学，带着工作上的问题学，改造思想，改进工作。会议期间，中共湖北省委组织参加会议的同志学习了焦裕禄同志的革命事迹和《人民日报》发表的中共山西襄垣县委“开门革命”的经验，象兰考和襄垣那样，努力解决县委领导革命化的问题。
    党委着重抓政治思想工作，抓什么？参加会议的同志认为，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓“五个不可忘记”，即不可忘记阶级斗争，不可忘记无产阶级专政，不可忘记依靠贫农下中农，不可忘记党的政策，不可忘记党的工作。今后那个单位生产没搞好，要首先从这五个方面找原因。当然，生产落后也有技术原因；但是，只要解决了这五个方面的问题，发挥了广大群众的积极性，技术问题就可以更好地解决。
    会议认为，突出政治，必须进一步改进各级党委的领导作风和领导方法。这次会上，中共湖北省委总结推广了孝感县实行“值班、蹲点、劳动、学习、民主”十个字的领导方法。所谓值班，就是从县、区、公社直到大队支部委员会各级党委主要领导成员轮流值班，负责处理委员会的日常工作，不值班的就下去蹲点。蹲点和值班的都参加劳动，进行调查研究、科学实验；都要学习毛主席著作；办一切事，都要发扬民主，同贫农下中农和基层干部商量，先民主，再集中。大家认为，这有利于充分发挥政府部门的作用，使党委摆脱事务，集中力量抓政治工作；有利于克服官僚主义，实现领导与群众相结合。
    这次会议还讨论了争取今年农业生产更大丰收的问题。会议要求全省各级党委，要教育广大干部、社员，把搞好本地区、本单位的生产同执行第三个五年计划联系起来，同支援国家建设、支援世界革命联系起来。进一步开展群众性的学习毛主席著作运动，在用字上狠下功夫，实现领导革命化，群众革命化。各级领导干部要坚持办好“三结合”的样板田，坚持群众路线的作风，放手发动群众，落实生产规划，狠抓措施落实，狠抓过硬技术。同时，要插红旗，树标兵，在全省开展以“五好”为目标的比学赶帮超的群众运动，把突出政治具体落实到开展“五好”运动、争取今年农业丰收的斗争中去。（附图片）
