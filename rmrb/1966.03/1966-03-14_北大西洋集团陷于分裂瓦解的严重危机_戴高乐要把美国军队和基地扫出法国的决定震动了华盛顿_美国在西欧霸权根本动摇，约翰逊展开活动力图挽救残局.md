    The North Atlantic Group is in a serious crisis of division and collapse.
    De Gaulle's decision to sweep American troops and bases out of France shakes Washington.
    US hegemony in Western Europe is fundamentally shaken, Johnson launches activities to salvage the situation.
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 13) Taking advantage of the United States' internal and external difficulties, French President De Gaulle has recently intensified his struggle to break free from American control. He formally proposed withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military "integration" mechanism and expelling American troops and bases from France, putting this aggressive group in the most serious crisis in its seventeen-year history.
    De Gaulle wrote a letter to US President Johnson on March 7. Subsequently, on March 12, the French government issued a memorandum to Western allies, targeting the United States and making these sharp demands. Prior to this, at a press conference on February 21, De Gaulle reiterated his intention to abolish the protective status established by the United States in Europe through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to end the military "integration" system. He also announced that, at the latest, by April 4, 1969, when the North Atlantic Treaty expires, foreign bases and troops (mainly American) on French territory would be brought under French jurisdiction. Within two weeks, on March 7, he took further concrete action, writing to Johnson and raising the issue of jurisdiction over the 30,000 US troops stationed in France and American bases.
    De Gaulle's move caused a great shock in Washington. After receiving the letter, Johnson hastily summoned his aides to discuss countermeasures. On the one hand, he replied to De Gaulle, threatening that his proposal struck at the heart of the alliance and could have a profound impact on Franco-American relations. On the other hand, he launched a large-scale diplomatic offensive through letters, telephone conversations, and other means, promoting to other allies that the US troops and bases in France were "related to the entire alliance," demanding that various allies express their opinions, support the US position, so as to isolate and attack France. On the 11th, the United States also secretly convened a meeting of representatives from fourteen allied countries in Paris behind France's back, attempting to pressure the allies to pass a joint declaration insisting on "military integration" to exert pressure on France. Negotiations are currently underway with various countries through diplomatic channels regarding the joint declaration.
    Johnson's approach provoked an even stronger reaction from France. After receiving Johnson's reply, French Minister of Information Bouchier announced at a press conference that France was prepared to take unilateral action to restore French sovereignty. France also distributed memorandums to various allies, explaining France's position. The memorandum stated that, due to fundamental differences between France and other allies on the issue of "integrated" military systems, it seemed impossible to reform the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Therefore, although France would remain within the Western alliance, it would withdraw from the current military "integration" organization.
    Western newspaper reports revealed that, for France, ending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military "integration" includes three aspects: First, foreign troops, bases, and facilities on French territory must either withdraw or be placed under the jurisdiction of the French authorities. Some newspapers believe that this is essentially asking the Americans to pack up and leave. In addition to causing embarrassment to the United States, it would also bring it huge material losses and technical difficulties. Second, withdrawing French troops and officers from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe near Paris and the Central European Command in Fontainebleau, and withdrawing the two French army divisions and three tactical air force squadrons still stationed in West Germany. De Gaulle already wrote to West German Chancellor Erhard on the 9th, requesting bilateral discussions on this matter. Third, relocating the above-mentioned two command headquarters from French territory.
    United Press International quoted French sources as saying that France would soon withdraw French officers, and troops stationed in West Germany might withdraw before the end of this year. France also hopes that US troops and bases stationed in France will withdraw before the end of this year.
    Judging from what De Gaulle said at his recent press conference and in the memorandum to allies, his considerations for accelerating the pace of withdrawing from the current form of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are threefold:
    First, to further break free from American control. De Gaulle said at a press conference on February 21 that France's subordinate position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was "incompatible" with its desire for autonomy. He believes that France, as a nuclear power, must assume its own "political and strategic responsibilities."
    Second, due to the Soviet Union's "detente" with the United States, the memorandum believes that the "imminent threat at the time of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949" no longer exists. Therefore, in De Gaulle's view, the current form of the North Atlantic military structure has lost its significance. At the same press conference, De Gaulle said that due to the "internal and external evolution" of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, "the danger to the West has largely disappeared...the possibility of a world war breaking out over European issues is diminishing to some extent." Therefore, the current military structure of the North Atlantic Alliance is no longer suitable for the new situation.
    Third, worrying that military subordination to the United States would drag France into the American war of aggression in Vietnam. De Gaulle never hides the fact that a very important consideration for his current eagerness to break free from American control is his fear that the United States will continue to expand the war and drag allies into the water. In this regard, De Gaulle made it very clear in his memorandum. He said that the center of international crisis has shifted from Europe to other regions, especially Asia, "and the Atlantic Alliance countries as a whole have nothing to do with what is happening there." France does not want to be "drawn into a war it does not want to fight."
    Western newspaper commentators generally believe that France's decision to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization raises the question of the future of the entire alliance. Many newspapers are already talking about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without France and envisioning various alternative solutions. Although British Prime Minister Wilson is still cheering for the United States, saying that without France, "the unity of the alliance must be maintained" and that it must continue, his Defense Minister Healey believes that without France's participation, the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be "greatly reduced." *The Times* is also concerned that some loose bilateral arrangements cannot equal an "alliance."

### 北大西洋集团陷于分裂瓦解的严重危机  戴高乐要把美国军队和基地扫出法国的决定震动了华盛顿  美国在西欧霸权根本动摇，约翰逊展开活动力图挽救残局

    北大西洋集团陷于分裂瓦解的严重危机
    戴高乐要把美国军队和基地扫出法国的决定震动了华盛顿
    美国在西欧霸权根本动摇，约翰逊展开活动力图挽救残局
    据新华社十三日讯　法国总统戴高乐最近趁美国内外交困的时机，加紧了摆脱美国控制的斗争，正式提出要退出北大西洋公约组织军事“一体化”机构、并把美军和基地赶出法国，使这个侵略集团面临着它十七年历史上最严重的危机。
    戴高乐三月七日给美国总统约翰逊写了一封信，接着，法国政府十二日又发表了给西方盟国的备忘录，针对美国，提出了这样一些尖锐的要求。前此，在二月二十一日的记者招待会上，戴高乐重申要取消美国利用北大西洋公约组织在欧洲建立的保护地位和结束军事“一体化”制度。他还宣布，至迟到一九六九年四月四日北大西洋公约期满时要把法国领土上的外国基地和部队（主要是美国的）收归法国管辖。不出两周，三月七日他就进一步采取具体行动，写信给约翰逊，提出三万驻法美军和美国基地的管辖权问题。
    戴高乐此举在华盛顿引起了很大的震动。约翰逊接信后慌忙召集左右，商讨对策。他一方面复信戴高乐，威胁说他的建议打击了联盟的心脏，可能对法美关系产生深刻的影响。另一方面，他又通过写信、电话交谈等途径，大肆展开外交活动，向其他盟国宣传驻法美军和基地“关系到整个联盟”，要求各盟国发表意见，支持美国的立场，以孤立和打击法国。十一日，美国还背着法国在巴黎秘密召开了十四个盟国代表会议，企图压各盟国通过一个坚持“军事一体化”的联合宣言，来对法国施加压力。目前还在通过外交途径就联合宣言同各国谈判。
    约翰逊的这一作法引起了法国更强烈的反应。在接到约翰逊复信后，法国宣传部长布歇就在记者招待会上宣布，法国准备单方面采取行动恢复法国的主权。法国还给各盟国分送了备忘录，说明法国的立场。备忘录说，由于法国和其他盟国在“一体化”军事体系问题上意见根本分歧，要改革北大西洋公约组织看来根本不可能，所以法国尽管将留在西方联盟内，但是要退出目前的军事“一体化”组织。
    西方报纸消息透露，对法国来说，结束北大西洋公约组织军事“一体化”包含三项内容：第一、法国领土上的外国军队、基地和设施要么撤走，要么交由法国当局管辖。有些报纸认为，这实际上是要美国佬卷起铺盖走路。这除了给美国面子上难堪以外，还会给它带来巨大的物质损失和技术困难。其次，从巴黎附近的欧洲盟军最高司令部和枫丹白露的中欧司令部撤回法国的军队和军官，撤回法国还留在西德的两个陆军师和三个战术空军联队。戴高乐已经在九日写信给西德总理艾哈德要求就此举行双边讨论。第三，上述两个司令部迁离法国领土。
    合众国际社引用法国人士的话说，法国很快就会撤退法国军官，驻西德军队可能在今年年底以前撤退。法国也希望驻法美军和基地在今年年底以前撤走。
    从戴高乐在最近的一次记者招待会上和致盟国备忘录中所说的话看来，他之所以要加快步调退出目前形式的北大西洋公约组织的考虑有三：
    一、进一步摆脱美国的控制。戴高乐在二月二十一日的记者招待会上说过，法国在北大西洋公约组织里所处的从属地位同它要自主的愿望是“不相容的”。他认为，法国，作为一个原子大国，必须承担它自己的“政治和战略责任”。
    二、由于苏联同美国搞“缓和”，备忘录认为，已经不存在“一九四九年北大西洋公约组织成立时的那种迫在眉睫的威胁”，所以，在戴高乐看来，目前形式的北大西洋军事结构已经失去其意义。在同一次记者招待会上，戴高乐说，由于苏联和东欧国家“内部和外部的演变……对西方的危险远远地消失了……在欧洲问题上爆发世界大战的可能性在某种程度上正在消失”，所以，目前的北大西洋联盟的军事结构已经不适合新的情况。
    三、担心同美国军事上的从属关系会把法国卷入美国侵略越南的战争中。戴高乐从不隐讳，他之所以在目前急于摆脱美国的控制，很重要的一个考虑就是怕美国不断扩大战争，拖盟国下水。在这方面，戴高乐在他的备忘录中说得很清楚。他说，国际危机的中心已从欧洲转到其他地区、特别是亚洲，“而大西洋联盟国家作为一个整体与那里的事情无关”。法国不愿“卷入一场它所不愿意打的战争”。
    西方报纸评论普遍认为，法国退出北大西洋公约组织的决定提出了整个联盟的前途问题。许多报纸已经在谈论没有法国的北大西洋公约组织和设想种种替代办法。虽然英国首相威尔逊还在替美国打气，说什么没有法国，“还要保持联盟的团结”，还要干下去，他的国防大臣希利却认为，没有法国参加，北大西洋公约组织的重要性将“大为缩小”。《泰晤士报》也担心，一些松弛的双边安排究竟不能等于一个“联盟”。
