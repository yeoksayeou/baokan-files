    Providing Valuable Data for Current Construction Needs and Scientific Research
    The State Science and Technology Commission Commends the Science and Education Film "Debris Flow"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st) The color science and education film "Debris Flow," produced by the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, brings the rare natural phenomenon of debris flow to the screen, allowing people to understand this natural disaster that poses a great threat to economic construction and the lives and property of people in mountainous areas, and to learn methods of defense.
    In early March, the State Science and Technology Commission wrote to the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, warmly congratulating the successful production of "Debris Flow" and praising the film for "supporting the needs of current construction and providing valuable data for scientific research."
    Last April, three creators from the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, Yin Hong, Pan Huigen, and Xu Feng, carrying Chairman Mao's works, and with the feeling that they must uncover the mysteries of nature and benefit the people, accompanied a scientific expedition team to Tibet. They climbed mountains and crossed rivers, hacking through thorns and thistles, exploring with the team during the day, and sitting in tents on the ice and snow at night to study "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao's instructions encouraged them to film a series of precious natural phenomena.

    为当前建设需要和科学研究提供了珍贵资料
    国家科委表扬科教片《泥石流》
    据新华社上海二十一日电　上海科学教育电影制片厂摄制的彩色科学教育片《泥石流》，把罕见的一种自然现象——泥石流搬上了银幕，使人们了解了这种对山区经济建设和人民生命财产具有很大破坏力的自然灾害，学到了防御办法。
    国家科学技术委员会三月初写信给上海科学教育电影制片厂，热烈祝贺《泥石流》的摄制成功，赞扬这部影片“配合了当前建设的需要，为科学研究提供了珍贵的资料”。
    去年四月，上海科学教育电影制片厂的殷虹、潘惠根和徐风等三位创作人员带着毛主席著作，怀着一定要揭破这个大自然的奥秘，为人民造福的感情，随同科学考察队到西藏去。他们爬山涉水，披荆斩棘，白天和队员一起探险，晚上坐在冰雪上的帐篷里，学习《矛盾论》。毛主席的指示，鼓舞着他们拍下了一系列珍贵的自然现象。
