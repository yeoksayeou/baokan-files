    I Got Inspiration
    I was deeply moved after studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and it gave me great inspiration. I learned a thought—a thorough revolutionary thought; a viewpoint—a clear class viewpoint; a style—a hard-working style; I found a root cause—that my own thinking was not guided by Mao Zedong Thought; and I strengthened two resolutions—the resolution to transform the objective world and the resolution to transform the subjective world.

    In the past, if you said I didn't have a thorough revolutionary thought, I couldn't figure it out. Now, after comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu, the facts are just like that. I think I am getting old and can't work in the countryside for many more years, so I am preparing to hand over my work. This is a manifestation of a lack of spirit. At the same time, my class feelings have weakened in the past two years, I don't care enough about the lives of the masses, and I am not hardworking enough in my work style. These are mainly because Mao Zedong Thought has not been in command.

    In the future, I will use Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, constantly look at myself, constantly compare myself, and be determined to transform my own thinking and establish a firm communist world outlook.

    我得到了启发
    学习焦裕禄同志的事迹后，深受感动，对我启发极大。我学到了一个思想——彻底革命的思想；一个观点——鲜明的阶级观点；一个作风——吃苦耐劳的作风；找到了一个根源——自己思想没有以毛泽东思想挂帅；坚定了两个决心——改造客观世界和改造主观世界的决心。
    过去，如果说我没有彻底革命思想，我还想不通，现在和焦裕禄同志比较后，事实就是如此。我认为自己年纪大了，在农村干不了几年了，准备交班，这就是精神状态不振的表现。同时，这两年自己的阶级感情淡薄了，关心群众生活不够，作风上不够艰苦。这些，主要是毛泽东思想没挂帅。
    今后，我要以焦裕禄同志为镜子，经常照、经常比，下定决心改造自己的思想，树立坚定的共产主义世界观。
      山西夏县县委书记  刘之光
