　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 4th—Pai Lazha, a company commander of the Chiang army remnants who fled to areas outside Yunnan province, along with "Second Lieutenant" administrative officer Zhou Youneng, squad leader Zha Yue, and other officers and soldiers, totaling twenty-eight people, under the influence of our lenient policy, were unwilling to continue serving as pawns for the US-Chiang clique. Since January, they have abandoned the darkness for the light, and surrendered to our border troops. Upon their return, they also brought with them three rifles and carbines, and more than two hundred and seventy rounds of ammunition.
　　The local People's Government has given lenient treatment to the Chiang army remnant personnel who surrendered and returned, and has made proper arrangements for their lives. Surrendering personnel who returned with weapons were also given bonuses according to regulations.

    不愿继续为美蒋卖命
    流窜云南境外蒋军二十八人投诚归来
    新华社昆明四日电　流窜云南境外的蒋军残部分队长排拉扎、“少尉”行政官周有能、小队长扎约等官兵二十八人，在我宽大政策的感召下，不愿继续为美蒋卖命，从一月份以来先后弃暗投明，向我边防部队投诚。他们在归来时，还携带步枪、卡宾枪三支和子弹二百七十多发。
    当地人民政府对投诚归来的蒋军残部人员给予宽大待遇，并妥善安排了他们的生活。对携带武器归来的投诚人员，还按照规定发给了奖金。
