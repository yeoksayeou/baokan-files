    Devoting Full Enthusiasm to Building Roads for the Nepalese People

    "Chinese Experts Truly Care About the Interests of the Masses"

    More than three years ago, comrades from the Chinese highway expert group set foot on the land of our friendly neighbor, the Kingdom of Nepal. With excitement, and entrusted by the people of our motherland, we went to help the Nepalese people build a highway. This highway, over one hundred kilometers long, would pass through towering mountains, stretching from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, all the way to the Friendship Bridge on the Sino-Nepalese border.

    We were far from our motherland, far from Chairman Mao, but we firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words. We were determined to make ourselves revolutionaries who wholeheartedly served the Chinese people and the people of the world, to be Bethune-style internationalist fighters.

    As soon as we arrived at the construction site in Nepal, the local people were very enthusiastic. They vacated their houses for us, moving elsewhere to live. But as soon as the tents from China arrived, we immediately set about erecting them, resolutely returning the houses to the masses. We lived in tents for several years, and the comrades all felt at ease and happy. Each time we went out to inspect the route, we always took care not to step on the rice paddies when passing through farmers' fields. If we accidentally knocked over a few seedlings, we would gently prop them up. The Nepalese friends traveling with us said with emotion, "Chinese experts truly care about the interests of the masses."

    For more than three years, the cadres and engineering technicians of the expert group have insisted on working alongside the Nepalese workers, resolutely shedding the airs of experts. On one occasion, a bridge pier caisson needed to be poured with concrete, requiring continuous overtime shifts for several nights. For several nights, our cadres and engineering technicians all went to the construction site to participate in the labor. Many Nepalese workers were very moved by this, and they voluntarily came to help, finally ensuring the smooth completion of the project.

    In order to choose a suitable route for the highway, the chief engineer led the survey team, climbing mountains and wading through rivers for more than two months, covering over six hundred kilometers. A Nepalese technician, Shah, said to us excitedly, "Your chief engineer is over fifty years old and still walked so many roads, climbed so many mountains, and crossed so many rivers. It's truly moving!" Another Nepalese friend said, "American experts take the most money, but are the most afraid of hardship. To inspect routes, they either take helicopters or jeeps. And if they go by car, they have people build the road for them first. The Chinese experts are unmatched!"

    "We Trust You!"

    Dr. Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self was not only reflected in his extreme responsibility towards his work, but also in his extreme enthusiasm for the people. We often asked ourselves: When the Nepalese people have illnesses and suffering, do we care for them like our own brothers? When they have difficulties, do we help them without hesitation? For more than three years, many comrades in our team have demanded this of themselves.

    Our expert group's doctors, in addition to treating the comrades of the expert group, treated an average of more than forty Nepalese people every day. Once, a Nepalese farmer had his leg broken by a rock, and the local Nepalese villagers carried him to our expert group for treatment. Our doctor immediately placed him on his own bed and performed a bone-setting operation. After the farmer returned home, our doctor was still worried. Every day, he had to climb over a thousand meters of high mountains and walk seven or eight li to change the farmer's dressing. More than a month later, the farmer's leg healed. His family sent people to our expert group, holding our doctor's hands, excitedly and gratefully saying repeatedly, "Chinese doctors are too good! Too good!" Another time, in Baskal, an elderly Nepalese woman fell ill, but our doctor happened to be away. The elderly woman waited for three days, unable to even walk. Although there were doctors from the American "Peace Corps" there, she insisted on waiting for the Chinese doctor to treat her. She said, "Chinese doctor, I just trust you!"

    Building a Friendship Bridge Over Turbulent Rapids

    In order to help the Nepalese masses overcome difficulties, our comrades often disregarded their own safety. In a deep mountain canyon, a suspension bridge made of iron chains was washed away by floods. The Nepalese laborers who needed to cross the river to the construction site could only temporarily string a rope across the canyon, risking their lives, using their hands and legs to straddle the rope, inching their way across. When three comrades from our expert group saw this scene, they felt very sad. They obtained steel cables, sledgehammers, and wooden planks, and resolved to build a bridge for the Nepalese people. But how to get to the shore to drive the piles and install the steel cables? The river was roaring and raging, the rapids crashing against the large rocks, stirring up high waves. The three comrades from our expert group also learned the Nepalese farmers' way of crossing the river, using their hands and legs to straddle the rope, slowly sliding across. When the Nepalese laborers learned that the comrades from our expert group were risking their lives to build a bridge for them, they were all moved and said in unison, "Chinese experts, too good." A suspension bridge was built, and the Nepalese laborers could safely pass through the bridge every day, no longer needing to sleep in caves and under trees.

    "Like Working With You"

    The comrades of our expert group regarded the Nepalese people as their own brothers, and the Nepalese people also regarded us as family. Wherever the Chinese experts went, whether it was the elderly or children, they would kindly say "Hello!" When we went to the construction site, we often had to pass through many cliffs and precipices, sometimes climbing forty-five-degree steep slopes, sometimes passing over shaky suspension bridges made of iron chains. At such times, the Nepalese laborers would often stop their own work, regardless of the danger, to help us pass through these dangerous roads.

    Once, four Nepalese carpenters came to the Baskal construction site and asked for work. At the time, we needed carpenters, so we kept them. They said, "We just like working with you, you sincerely teach us techniques, you treat us too well!" The Nepalese masses truly regarded the Chinese experts as family. During the Nepalese Dasain festival, the workers sent representatives, carrying peanuts, sugarcane, and bananas from their homes, walking for two full days, to visit us in Kathmandu. At parting, they tearfully held our hands and said, "How much we want to work with you again!" (Originally published in the February 24th "China Youth Daily") (Attached picture)

### 满腔热忱为尼泊尔人民修路

    满腔热忱为尼泊尔人民修路
    刘春义
    “中国专家真关心群众利益”
    三年多以前，中国公路专家组的同志踏上了我们友好邻邦尼泊尔王国的土地。我们带着激动的心情，受祖国人民的重托，去帮助尼泊尔人民修建公路。这条公路全长一百多公里，它将穿过丛山峻岭，从尼泊尔的首都加德满都一直伸延到中尼边境的友谊桥。
    我们远离了祖国，远离了毛主席，但是我们牢牢地记住毛主席的话。我们立志要使自己成为全心全意为中国人民和全世界人民服务的革命者，当白求恩式的国际主义战士。
    我们一到尼泊尔的工地，当地群众很热情，他们把自己的房子让出来给我们，自己却搬到别处去住。但是当国内的帐篷一到，我们马上动手把帐篷搭起来，坚决把房子退还给群众。我们住了几年帐篷，同志们的心情都感到坦然愉快。每次出外视察路线，当我们穿过农民秧田的时候，我们总是注意不要踩坏秧田，如果碰歪了几棵秧苗，我们一定轻轻地把它们扶起来。同行的尼泊尔朋友感动地说：“中国专家真关心群众利益。”
    三年多以来，专家组的干部和工程技术人员坚持同尼泊尔工人一起劳动，坚决丢掉专家架子。有一次，有一个桥基沉井要浇灌混凝土，必须连续加几个夜班干完，几个晚上，我们的干部和工程技术人员全到工地去参加劳动了。很多尼泊尔工人看了很受感动，他们主动地跑来一起干，终于保证了这项工程的顺利完成。
    为了给公路选择一条合适的路线，总工程师带领着测量队，两个多月，爬山涉水，走了六百多公里的路程。一个尼泊尔技术员沙哈激动地对我们说：“你们的总工程师五十多岁了还走了这么多路，爬了这么多的山，跨过那么多的河，真叫人感动！”还有位尼泊尔朋友说：“美国专家拿钱最多，但是最怕吃苦。去视察路线，不是坐直升飞机，就是坐吉普车。要是坐车去还得由人先给他把路修出来。中国专家谁也比不上啊！”
    “就是信得过你们！”
    白求恩大夫毫不利己专门利人的精神，不光表现在他对工作的极端负责任，还表现在对人民的极端热忱。我们常常这样问自己：当尼泊尔老百姓有了疾苦的时候，我们是不是象亲兄弟一样去关心他们？当他们有了困难的时候，我们是不是毫不犹疑地去帮助他们？三年多来，我们队伍里的许多同志正是这样要求自己的。
    我们专家组的医生，除了给专家组的同志看病以外，平均每个大夫每天要为四十多个尼泊尔老百姓治病。有一次一个尼泊尔农民被石头砸断了腿，当地的尼泊尔老乡就把他抬到我们专家组来治疗。我们的大夫立刻把他安置在自己床上，进行了接骨手术。这位农民回去后，我们的大夫还不放心。每天他还要爬上一千多米的高山，走七八里地，去给这位农民换药。一个多月以后，这位农民的腿长好了。他们家里专门派人到我们专家组来，拉着我们大夫的手，又激动又感激地连声说：“中国医生太好啦！太好啦！”还有一次，在巴斯卡尔，有一位尼泊尔老大娘病了，我们的医生恰好不在那里。这位老大娘等了三天，连路都走不动了。虽然那里有美国“和平队”的医生，但她还是坚持非要等中国大夫来给她治。她说：“中国大夫啊，我就是信得过你们！”
    激流上架起友谊桥
    为了帮助尼泊尔群众克服困难，我们的同志常常把自己的生命安危置之度外。在一个深山峡谷，有一座铁索吊桥被洪水冲断了。要过河来工地的尼泊尔民工，只能临时在峡谷上拉一根绳索，冒着生命危险，用双手双腿挎住绳索，一点一点地滑过来。我们专家组的三位同志看到这情景，心里很难过。他们弄到了钢索、鎯头、木板，决心要为尼泊尔老百姓搭一座桥。但是怎么到岸边去打桩眼，把钢索安上呢？河水在汹涌咆哮，急流冲击着大石，激起了高高的浪花。我们专家组的三位同志，也学着尼泊尔农民过河的办法，用手和腿挎住绳索，慢慢地滑过去。当尼泊尔的民工知道我们专家组的同志冒着生命危险为他们架桥的时候，都感动得异口同声地说：“中国专家，太好啦。”一座吊桥搭起来了，尼泊尔民工们每天可以稳稳当当通过这座桥，再也不需要露宿在山洞树下了。
    “喜欢同你们一起干活”
    我们专家组的同志把尼泊尔老百姓看成自己的亲兄弟，尼泊尔老百姓也把我们当作亲人一样。中国专家所到之处，无论是老人，还是小孩，都会亲切地叫“您好！”我们下工地时，常常要经过许多断崖峭壁，有时候要爬过四十五度的陡坡，有时候要经过摇摇晃晃的铁索桥。在这样的时候，尼泊尔的民工常常会停下自己的工作，不顾危险，帮助我们通过这些险路。
    有一次巴斯卡尔工地上来了四个尼泊尔木工，要求工作。当时我们正需要木工，就把他们留下来了。他们说，“我们就是喜欢同你们一起干活，你们真心教我们技术，你们待我们太好啦！”尼泊尔群众真是把中国专家当成了亲人，在尼泊尔的德赛节，工人们推派了代表，从家里背上花生、甘蔗、芭蕉，足足步行了两天，到加德满都来看望我们。临别时，他们含泪拉着我们的手说：“多么想再和你们在一起工作啊！”（原载二月二十四日《中国青年报》）（附图片）
