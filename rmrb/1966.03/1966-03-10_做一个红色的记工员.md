    Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong said that women "are a force determining the victory or defeat of the revolution." Women account for half of the population and play an important role in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. At present, many female cadres and masses on various fronts in our country, with deep class feelings, are studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a living way, and their spiritual outlook and work style have undergone profound changes. Facts fully prove that Comrade Mao Zedong's books are the most powerful weapon for giving full play to the role of women as "half the sky" and promoting women's conscious and thorough revolution.
    The authors of these articles include commune work-point recorders, telephone operators, nurses, foremen, and family members of workers. They are doing different work in different posts, but because they have worked hard to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, improved their ideological awareness, and always think of "revolution" in everything, they have made their own contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in ordinary work posts.

    Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Happy to Be a Work-Point Recorder
    In March 1965, the commune members elected me as a work-point recorder. At that time, I had many concerns. On the surface, I said I couldn't do it, but in reality, I had four fears in my mind: first, fear of trouble; second, fear of difficulty; third, fear of scolding; and fourth, fear of being criticized. Fearing trouble meant that being a work-point recorder was not freedom, I had to use a pen and abacus every day. Others could rest, but I still had to calculate work points. Fearing difficulty was because I only had a primary school education, I couldn't use the abacus quickly or accurately, and if I made mistakes, the commune members would be dissatisfied. It was truly like carrying a stone uphill – exerting effort without gaining advantage. Fearing scolding meant that evaluating work points was difficult, I was afraid that the masses would be unreasonable and scold me, suffering undeserved grievances. Fearing criticism was that as time went on, I wouldn't be able to figure out the accounts, and wouldn't be able to explain them, fearing being criticized. Thinking it over, more and more problems arose, and more and more difficulties were thought of. Just when I was ideologically confused and couldn't make up my mind, I went to read Chairman Mao's books and saw in the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" that Comrade Bethune was a foreigner, he was completely selfless, and regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. And I am a commune member, yet I dare not take on collective affairs. What kind of thinking is this! Thinking of this, I felt ashamed, and I expressed my attitude to the leaders and commune members, willing to do the work-point recorder work and ensuring that it would be done well.

    Serving the People, Welcome Criticism
    After evaluating work points for a few days, I encountered many problems. Once, during the summer harvest and planting, I reported the ten-day summary of work points, reporting in detail what everyone did each day. I thought the task could be completed, but unexpectedly, after I reported, several commune members asked one after another, "How many points do I have?" "How many points do I have?" Some people asked me to report it again. At that time, I impatiently said, "You didn't listen when I reported, what's the point of reporting more!" My saying this angered the young Ma Meizhen, who said in a loud and rough voice, "If you don't want to do it, then don't do it!" At that time, I was so sad that I almost cried. I thought this work was really difficult, and you would get angry at any moment. At that time, I managed to endure it, but I was not convinced in my heart. That night, I studied Chairman Mao's works and read the article "Serve the People." Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others pointing out our shortcomings if we have them. No matter who it is, anyone can point them out to us. If you are right, we will correct them." The more I read, the more I felt that what Chairman Mao said was absolutely true. In this way, I relieved my depression and didn't bother with some commune members saying excessive things, and I also realized that I had not fulfilled my responsibility in my work. Another time, I reported the ten-day summary of work points to the male commune members. After reporting, Ma Guolin said: "Your team committee is not responsible, they missed recording my work points. I have said it several times, but you didn't evaluate them for me." I explained the situation to him, but he didn't listen to my explanation at all, and further said that I was "subjective" and "irresponsible in my work," etc. At that time, I couldn't suppress the fire in my heart and argued with him. That night, I was not calm in my heart, so I read Chairman Mao's books again and repeatedly reviewed "Serve the People." Chairman Mao said: "As long as we persist in doing what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will surely prosper." These words enlightened me, and I thought, Ma Guolin's suggestion is a good one, it is helping me improve my work, how can I argue with him? After understanding this, I discussed it with the team leader the next day and re-evaluated his work points.

    To Be a Good Work-Point Recorder, Be Extremely Responsible
    To be a good work-point recorder, you must strictly demand yourself and not be careless. Once, when announcing the ten-day summary of work points, commune member Wang Huizhen said: "Why was my work point not evaluated for one day?" I thought, I shouldn't have missed a day's work points! Thinking it over and over, I couldn't figure out the reason for the omission. I went to read Chairman Mao's books and asked Chairman Mao for guidance. I read in the article "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Surveys'": "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." Yes, if I can't remember, why not go to the commune members to investigate and understand? I took advantage of a lunch break and an evening to go to the masses to understand and reminisce with the commune members. Through investigation, it was determined that Wang Huizhen indeed did not go to work that day. After saying this, Wang Huizhen herself remembered and admitted that she indeed did not go to work. In mid-November 1965, during the autumn distribution, after the total work points were announced, Xu A'bao said that he was short more than one hundred work points, and he told everyone. After hearing this, I couldn't calm down. That night, I read Chairman Mao's article "On the Chongqing Negotiations." Chairman Mao said: "Going there is for work. What is work? Work is struggle. Those places have difficulties and problems that need us to solve. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we have to go, that is a good comrade." These words spoke to my heart. The next day, I went to Xu A'bao's house and compared it with her item by item. In the end, I found that a batch of flower-catching work points had been missed and not reported, with a difference of one hundred and forty-three work points. This matter gave me an extremely profound lesson: if you are afraid of difficulties and don't solve them, it will seriously affect the labor enthusiasm of the commune members and bring losses to the Party and the collective economy.

    I have not studied Chairman Mao's books for a long time, but I have realized that there are thousands upon thousands of golden keys in Chairman Mao's books that can open any lock. Many locks that I myself cannot open and knots that I cannot untie have been opened and untied by Chairman Mao's books. I have also realized that reading Chairman Mao's books is the foundation of doing things and being a person. If you don't study Chairman Mao's works and don't arm your mind with Mao Zedong Thought, you will lose your way and not do your job well.

### 做一个红色的记工员

专栏：

    编者按：毛泽东同志说，妇女“是决定革命胜败的一个力量”。妇女占人口的半数，在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，起着重要的作用。目前，我国各个战线上许多妇女干部和群众，怀着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东同志著作，她们的精神面貌和工作面貌发生了深刻的变化。事实充分证明：毛泽东同志的书，是充分发挥妇女“半边天”的作用，推动妇女自觉革命、彻底革命的最强大武器。
    这几篇文章的作者，有公社记工员、电话员、护士、工长、职工家属。她们在不同岗位上做着不同的工作，但是，由于努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，提高了思想觉悟，时时事事想到“革命”二字，就在平凡的工作岗位上，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出了自己的贡献。
    做一个红色的记工员
    江苏太仓县浏河公社刘南大队社员  吴志凤
    读毛主席书  乐意做记工员
    在一九六五年三月份，社员选我当记工员，当时我的思想有很多顾虑，表面上说我不会做，实际上是思想上有四怕：一怕烦，二怕难，三怕骂，四怕整。怕烦，是做了记工员不自由，要天天动笔动算盘，人家可以休息，我还要算工分。怕难，是我只有高小文化水平，算盘打不快，打不准，弄错了，社员要不满意，真是搬了石头上山——吃力不讨好。怕骂，是评工分做难人，怕群众不讲道理，要骂到我头上来，吃冤枉气。怕整，是将来日子一长，搞不清账目，没法交代，怕挨批评。想来想去，问题越想越多，困难也越想越多。正在思想混乱，拿不定主意的时候，我就去读毛主席的书，看到《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里写着，白求恩同志是一个外国人，他毫不利己，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，而我是一个社员，集体的事情，还不敢担当起来，这是啥思想呀！想到这里，我就觉得难为情，我就向领导和社员表示了态度，愿意做记工员工作，保证把它搞好。
    为人民服务  要欢迎批评
    评了几天工分，碰上很多问题。有一次，夏收夏种中，我报十天小结工分，把每人每天做啥活都详细报过一遍，心想任务总可以完成了吧，没想到等我报过以后，有好几个社员，接二连三地问：“我几分？”“我几分？”有的人提出，要我再报一遍。我当时就不耐烦地说：“我报的时候，你们不听，有啥多报头！”我这样一讲，惹怒了青年马美珍，她高声粗气地说，“你不愿意做，就不要做！”当时我难过得几乎哭出来。我想这工作实在难做，动不动就要受气。当时总算忍耐了下来，但心里不服气。当天晚上，学习了毛主席著作，读了《为人民服务》一文。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”我越看越觉得毛主席讲的话千真万确。这样，就解除了苦闷，不去计较有的社员讲些过分话，自己也认识到，在工作中没尽到责任。又有一次，我向男社员报十天小结工分数，报好以后，马国林说：“你们队委不负责任，漏记了我的工分，我老早讲过好几次，你们不给我评。”我向他说明了情况，但他根本不听我的解释，进一步还说我“主观”、“工作不负责”等。当时，我压不住内心的火，同他争吵了起来。在这天晚上，我心里不平静，就又读了毛主席的书，反复重温《为人民服务》，毛主席说：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”这几句话启发了我，我想，马国林提的是好意见，是帮助我改进工作，我怎能去和他争吵呢？想通后，第二天就和队长商量好，补评了他的工分。
    当好记工员  要极端负责
    做一个好的记工员，要严格要求自己，不能马虎。有一次，也是公布十天小结工分，社员王惠珍说：“有一天，我的工分为啥没评着。”我想，不会漏掉一天工分吧！想来想去，想不出漏掉的原因。我就去读毛主席的书，向毛主席请教。读到《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》一文上说：“没有调查就没有发言权”。对呀，自己记不起，为啥不到社员中去调查了解？我抽一个中午和晚上的空闲时间，到群众中去了解，同社员一起回想。通过调查，认定王惠珍那天确实没有出工，这样一说，王惠珍自己也想起来了，承认确实没有出工。一九六五年十一月中旬，秋季分配的时候，总工分公布后，许阿宝说少一百多个工分，并且到处讲。我听到以后，心总是安不下来。那天晚上又读了毛主席的《关于重庆谈判》一文，毛主席说：“去，是为了工作去的。什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这几句话说到我心里。第二天，我去许阿宝家和她一笔一笔对，对到最后，果然漏掉一笔捉花工分，没有上报，相差一百四十三个工分。这件事给我极为深刻的教训：如果怕困难，不去解决，就会严重影响到社员的劳动积极性，给党给集体经济带来损失。
    我学习毛主席的书时间不长，可是我体会到在毛主席的书里有千千万万个金钥匙，能打开任何一把锁。我自己有很多打不开的锁，解不开的疙瘩，都被毛主席的书打开和解开了。我还认识到，读毛主席的书是办事、做人的根本。假使不学毛主席的著作，不以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，就要迷失方向，做不好工作。
