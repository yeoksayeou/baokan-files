    Xinhua News Agency, 11th - According to reports from returning fishermen: The No. 3001 and No. 3010 fishing boats of the Shijiao Brigade of the Beipo People's Commune in Suixi County, Guangdong Province, were fishing in the public waters of the Beibu Gulf fishing grounds on March 2nd. At 9:45 AM, four U.S. imperialist military aircraft flew in from the southwest, suddenly dove towards the two fishing boats, and dropped eleven bombs, which exploded in the sea in front of and behind the fishing boats, seriously threatening the safety of our fishermen and fishing boats.
    The Johnson administration of the United States, while expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, has brazenly bombed our fishing boats engaged in normal production on the high seas, carrying out military provocations, which have aroused close attention from our relevant departments.

    美机公然在公海上轰炸我渔船
    我有关方面严密注视美帝的军事挑衅
    新华社十一日讯　据回来的渔民报告：我广东省遂溪县北坡人民公社石角大队的三○○一号和三○一○号渔船两艘，三月二日在北部湾公海渔场捕鱼。九时四十五分，美帝国主义军用飞机四架从西南方向飞来，突然向这两艘渔船低空俯冲，投下炸弹十一枚，落在渔船前后的海里爆炸，使我渔民和渔船的安全受到严重威胁。
    美国约翰逊政府在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，公然在公海上轰炸我正常生产的渔船，进行军事挑衅，已引起我有关方面的严密注意。（附图片）
