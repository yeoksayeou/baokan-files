    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th. The first meeting of the "Japan-Soviet Economic Cooperation Committee," held here by the new Soviet leaders and the Sato government to strengthen their collusion, took place from the 14th to the 19th, with six sessions held, and concluded on the afternoon of the 23rd after signing a joint statement.

    According to Japanese bourgeois newspapers, at the meeting, the Soviet side's "expectations" and "enthusiasm" towards Japan on the issue of Japan-Soviet economic cooperation made Japan "very surprised." In order to persuade Japan to give "assistance" to the Soviet Union's plan to develop Siberia, Soviet representatives gave detailed explanations of the Soviet Union's "new Five-Year Plan," which has not yet been approved, to representatives of Japanese monopoly capital and government economic officials. The Soviet representatives also proposed four huge plans at the meeting for Japan to help it develop Siberia. A commentary by Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 23rd said that the Soviet Union's active request for Japan's assistance in developing Siberia was due to the Soviet Union's "policy towards Communist China" and had "defense reasons and political reasons."

    According to reports, Japan, taking advantage of the new Soviet leaders' political and economic reliance on Japan, put aside the Soviet Union's proposal for cooperative development of Siberia and first demanded that the Soviet Union agree to let Japan develop Sakhalin's natural gas, which could bring great benefits to Japanese monopoly capital in the short term, claiming that whether the Soviet Union agrees to this demand is the "touchstone" of "Japan-Soviet economic cooperation." Japan also demanded that the Soviet Union allow Japan to develop copper mines in Eastern Siberia to meet the urgent needs of the capitalist world for this strategic material. It was revealed that the Soviet Union expressed no objection to Japan's development of natural gas in Sakhalin. Regarding Japan's request to develop copper mines in Eastern Siberia, in addition to the Soviet representative expressing to the Japanese Sumitomo Zaibatsu Group on the 17th that the Soviet Union could sell some of its existing refined copper to Japan, Nesterov, the head of the Soviet delegation, specifically told reporters from the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* after the meeting: "The Soviet Union is prepared to resolve this issue in a commercial manner, so please do not worry."

    The joint statement issued by Japan and the Soviet Union after the talks stated that the two sides "exchanged views widely and frankly" during the meeting and "achieved epoch-making results in deepening mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries." The two sides also decided to fix the "Japan-Soviet Economic Cooperation Committee" as a channel for strengthening political and economic collusion between the two countries, and agreed to hold a second meeting in Moscow next year.

    According to Japanese newspapers, both Japan and the Soviet Union "highly evaluated" the results of this meeting. Kyodo News reported that the Japanese government believes that this meeting is a "quiet revolution" in Japan-Soviet economic relations.

    Nesterov, the head of the Soviet delegation, told Japanese reporters after the meeting, "The results of this meeting make me believe that there is nothing that can be called an obstacle to expanding trade relations and economic cooperation between Japan and the Soviet Union," and that "there are no obstacles to improving good-neighborly relations between the two countries."

    Japanese experts on Soviet affairs believe that this meeting was an economic meeting with political objectives, held by Japan and the Soviet Union against the background of US-Soviet cooperation. Both sides attempted to promote political cooperation through economic cooperation in order to achieve the goal of jointly opposing China.

    苏联领导联日反华已到不择手段地步
    竟乞求日本帮助开发西伯利亚
    日报说苏联代表在日苏会谈中的“热情”令人“吃惊”
    新华社东京二十四日电  苏联新领导同佐藤政府为加强勾结而在这里举行的“日苏经济合作委员会”第一次会议，从十四日到十九日举行了六次会议，在二十三日下午签署了一项共同声明后收场。
    据日本资产阶级报纸报道，在会议上，苏联方面对日苏经济合作问题上表现出的对日本的“期待”和“热情”，使日本“大吃一惊”。苏联代表为了劝诱日本对于苏联开发西伯利亚的计划给以“协助”，竟把还没有通过的苏联“新五年计划”向日本大垄断资本的代表和政府经济官员们做了详细的说明。苏联代表在会上还提出了要日本帮助它开发西伯利亚的四项庞大计划。日本广播协会电台二十三日的评论说，苏联积极要求日本协助开发西伯利亚，是出于苏联“对共产党中国的政策”，有着“国防上的理由和政治上的理由”。
    据报道，日本利用苏联新领导在政治上、经济上都有求于日本的情况，把苏联要求合作开发西伯利亚的建议搁置在一旁，首先要求苏联答应由日本开发可在短期内给日本垄断资本带来很大利益的库页岛天然气，扬言苏联是否同意这一要求，是“日苏经济合作”的“试金石”。日本还要求苏联让日本开发东西伯利亚的铜矿，以适应目前资本主义世界对这项战略物资的迫切需要。据透露，苏联对于日本开发库页岛的天然瓦斯问题表示没有异议。对于日本要求开发东西伯利亚铜矿问题，除了由苏联代表在十七日同日本住友财阀集团会谈时表示苏联可以把现有的精铜卖些给日本之外，苏联代表团团长涅斯捷罗夫又特地在会议结束后对《日本经济新闻》记者说：“这一问题苏联准备按着商业方式解决，请不要担心”。
    日苏双方在会谈后发表的联合声明说，双方在会议过程中，“广泛而坦率地交换了意见”，“在加深两国的理解和友好方面取得了划时代的成果”。双方并决定把“日苏经济合作委员会”作为两国政治、经济加强勾结的渠道固定下来，并且约定明年在莫斯科举行第二次会议。
    据日本报纸报道，日苏双方对这次会议的成果“评价很高”。共同社报道说，日本政府认为，这次会议是日苏两国经济关系上的“悄悄的革命”。
    苏联代表团团长涅斯捷罗夫在会议结束后对日本记者说，“这次会议的结果使我认为扩大日苏间的贸易关系、经济合作关系没有可以称为障碍的东西”，而且“改善两国睦邻关系的障碍也不存在”。
    日本的苏联问题专家认为，这次会议是在美苏合作的背景下，日苏双方举行的一次以政治目的为主的经济会议。双方都企图通过经济合作，促进政治的合作，以达到联合反华的目的。
