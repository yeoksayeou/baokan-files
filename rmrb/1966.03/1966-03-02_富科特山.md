    Phou Kout Mountain is located in Xieng Khouang Province, more than twenty kilometers away from Khang Khay City, with an altitude of over 1,300 meters. Phou Kout Mountain is a natural barrier to the northwest of the Plain of Jars and is known as the "Iron Gate of the Plain of Jars." American imperialism and its running dogs have always dreamed of occupying the Plain of Jars, and to do so, they must first capture Phou Kout Mountain, this "Iron Gate." Since July of last year, American imperialism and its running dogs have repeatedly invaded Phou Kout Mountain. Especially since the beginning of February this year, American imperialism has pieced together a large number of puppet troops and launched a frenzied offensive against Phou Kout Mountain, attempting to open this "Iron Gate" and then capture the Plain of Jars. However, the heroic patriotic Laotian soldiers and civilians have shattered the enemy's offensive. The Phou Kout Mountain position has always stood like iron, towering before the enemy.

    富科特山
    富科特山位于川圹省，距康开市二十多公里，拔海一千三百多米。富科特山是查尔平原西北面的一道天然屏障，有“查尔平原铁门”之称。美帝国主义及其走狗一直梦想占领查尔平原，为此就必须首先攻占富科特山这个“铁门”。从去年七月以来，美帝国主义及其走狗多次进犯富科特山。特别是自今年二月初以来，美帝国主义拼凑了大量的傀儡军队，向富科特山发动疯狂的进攻，企图打开这个“铁门”，进而攻占查尔平原。但是英雄的老挝爱国军民粉碎了敌人的进攻。富科特山阵地始终象钢铁一样地巍然屹立在敌人面前。
