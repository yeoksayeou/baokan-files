    In a small village at the foot of Mount Luofu in Guangdong, there is a rural cultural center jointly run by soldiers and commune members. The local people affectionately call it the Army-Civilian Friendship Club.
    The cultural center is neatly arranged with Chairman Mao's works and a batch of red books. On the sunny wall is posted the song "Learn from Wang Jie, Be Wholeheartedly for the Revolution." Among the books in the club are a large number of revolutionary war memoirs. There are also slogans on the wall such as "Adhere to the Four Firsts" and "Hard Training to Master the Skills to Kill the Enemy." It can be seen that the soldiers have put a lot of effort into the construction of the club.
    Before the establishment of the cultural center, the village youth lacked books to read and collective activities after work. How envious they were of the soldiers in the nearby barracks, who had singing and dancing, lively amateur activities!
    The neighboring machine gun company of a certain unit and the commune members of Jiaotaitou Production Team got along like one family. The soldiers often waded across a shallow river to help the commune members carry water, sweep the floor, plant in spring, and harvest in autumn. However, things are always developing. With the deepening of the soldiers' study of Chairman Mao's works, their understanding of supporting the government and cherishing the people has become more and more profound. They are no longer merely satisfied with helping the masses with spring planting and autumn harvesting, and gradually developed the idea of helping their relatives study Chairman Mao's works and improve their ideological awareness. At this time, the Party put forward the call for cultural work to face the countryside and occupy the ideological front, pointing out the path for them. They immediately bought more than eighty copies of Chairman Mao's works and some red books and sent them to Jiaotaitou Production Team, throwing themselves into the work of establishing a cultural center with fiery enthusiasm. It was just one evening not long after the cultural center was established, when the soldiers were preparing to go to the production team, there was thunder and lightning, and a torrential rain began to fall. The soldiers were not afraid of difficulties, they put the copied song sheets in their pockets and set off in the rain. But when they walked to the river, they were suddenly stunned. The shallow river, which was not even knee-deep, was flooded by the mountain torrents and could not be crossed. What to do? Could they go back? When they thought of the commune members waiting for them, the soldiers seemed to have gained strength and went downstream along the river regardless. They detoured for five miles, found a bridge, and finally did not break their promise. When the soldiers, covered in mud, took out the neatly folded song sheets from their chests, the cultural center was boiling. The commune members said that the soldiers brought not only a red song, but also a red heart to us. In this way, they finally set up a lively and popular cultural center.
    The young people studied "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune", and gradually understood the spiritual world of the soldiers. The young people thought very simply: Bethune, a foreigner, also helped us Chinese. The unknown soldiers of the People's Liberation Army regarded our village as their hometown. Shouldn't we help others in our own home? A gratifying atmosphere appeared in the village day by day. When the team distributed firewood and rice, people no longer carried it to their own homes first, but first carried it back to those families lacking labor. The water jars of some families lacking people to carry water were unknowingly filled with water. The young woman Zhu Zengdi imitated the soldiers in this way, delivering water to an old couple every day before dawn. One day, the old man was so moved that he was uneasy. He grabbed the girl's hand and said, "Zengdi, you are so good, how can I thank you?" The girl said carelessly, "I don't need thanks. Chairman Mao is telling us to do good deeds!"
    The activists in the cultural center are not all young people. Among them is a sixty-five-year-old man named Zhu Liji. At first, the elderly were not very interested in the club, but he loved the People's Liberation Army. He firmly believed that the soldiers would not do meaningless things, so he also came to the cultural center. At first, the old man heard the story of "Nine Red Hearts Towards the Motherland" and the story of the 12,000-ton hydraulic press. Later, he studied "All Work is for the Revolution" and "Serve the People," and his heart gradually broadened. The old man took care of two cows for the production team. Originally, he thought that such an age was good enough, but unknowingly he felt that he still had extra strength to use, so he handed the cows over to his wife to graze, and he followed the livestock to collect manure every day, accumulating more than 4,000 catties of good fertilizer for the production team every month.
    In this way, the commune members, under the leadership of the production team and with the help of the soldiers, studied Chairman Mao's works and established the ambition to engage in production with the spirit of Dazhai. When they lacked money to buy chemical fertilizers, they went up the mountain to cut grass and resolutely refused national loans. Building fertilizer toilets required several hundred yuan to buy wood. They went to the forest farm in the deep mountains to cut down trees themselves, and spent more than ten yuan to get things done. The commune members also started early and worked late to open canals to divert water and improve natural conditions. Last year, this small Jiaotaitou Production Team with more than 120 people increased grain production by 50,000 catties. The harvest of production added glory to the cultural center. The commune members said that the cultural center contributed to this.

    军民友谊俱乐部
    邝新芬
    广东罗浮山山脚下一个小小的村庄里，有个部队战士和社员合办的农村文化室，当地群众亲切地把它叫着军民友谊俱乐部。
    文化室干干净净地摆着毛主席著作和一批红色书籍，向阳的墙壁上贴着《学习王杰，一心为革命》的歌曲。俱乐部书籍中，有大批的革命战争回忆录，墙壁上还有“坚持四个第一”，“苦练杀敌本领”的标语，可以看出，在俱乐部的建设中，战士们花了不少心血。
    在成立文化室以前，村里青年劳动以后，缺乏书看，也没有多少集体活动。他们是多么羡慕附近营房战士们有歌有唱，活蹦乱跳的业余活动啊！
    角田头生产队的邻居，某部机枪连和社员们相处得一家人一样，战士们经常涉过一道浅浅的小河，帮社员担水、扫地、春种、秋收。但是，事情总是不断在发展，随着战士们学习毛主席著作的深入，对拥政爱民的认识也愈来愈深刻了。他们不再仅仅满足于帮助群众春种秋收，逐渐产生了帮亲人学习毛主席著作，提高思想觉悟的意念。正在这时，党提出了文化工作面向农村，占领思想阵地的号召，给他们指出了道路。他们马上买了八十多本毛主席著作单行本和一些红色书籍送到角田头生产队，以火一样的热情，投入了建立文化室的工作。还是文化室刚成立不久的一个晚上，战士们准备到生产队去的时候，雷电交加，下起了倾盆大雨。战士们毫不畏难，把抄好的歌篇揣在怀里，冒雨出发。但他们走到河边时，突然愣住了，原来深不没膝的小河被冲下来的山洪涨满，无法涉渡了，怎么办？能够回去吗？当想到社员们正在期待着他们的时候，战士们身上好象增加了力量，不顾一切地沿河向下游走去。他们绕了五里路，找到了桥，终于没有失约。当浑身泥水的战士从胸前掏出折得整整齐齐的歌片时，文化室沸腾了，社员们说，战士们送来的不仅是一篇红歌，还送给了我们一颗红心。就这样，他们终于办起了一个有声有色、受人欢迎的文化室。
    青年们学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，慢慢地了解了战士们的精神世界。青年们想的很简单：白求恩一个外国人还帮助我们中国，素不相识的解放军战士把我们村当作家乡，我们在自己家里还不能帮助别人吗？村子里一天天出现了可喜的气象。队里分柴分米，人们不再是先往自己家里担，而是先给那些缺乏劳力的家庭担回去，也有些缺人担水的家庭的缸里，不知不觉被人添满了水。女青年朱曾娣就是这样模仿着战士，每天天不亮就摸着黑给一对老夫妇送水。一天，这位老大爷实在被感动得心中不安了，他抓住姑娘的手说：“曾娣，你这样好，大爷怎样谢你呢？”这位姑娘却毫不在意地说：“我不要谢，这是毛主席在叫我们做好事呀！”
    文化室的积极分子不完全是青年，其中就有一个六十五岁的老汉朱李九。开始，老年人对俱乐部并没有多大兴趣，但是他热爱解放军，他深信战士们不会办那些没有意义的事情，于是他也走进文化室来了。起初，老人在这里听到了《九颗红心向祖国》和关于一万二千吨水压机的故事，后来又学习《一切工作都是为革命》，和《为人民服务》，他的心逐渐开阔起来了。老人为生产队看两头牛，本来他以为以这样的年纪就算说得过去了，可是不知不觉地他感到自己还有多余的力量可使，于是把牛交给老伴去放，自己每天跟着牲口去拾粪，每一个月都为生产队积四千多斤上好肥料。
    社员们就是这样在生产队领导下，在战士们的帮助下，学习了毛主席著作，树立了用大寨精神搞生产的志气。买化肥缺钱了，他们上山刈草，坚决不要国家贷款，盖积肥厕所买木材要几百元，他们到深山的林场里自己动手采伐，用了十几元也办成了事情；社员们还起早贪黑开渠引水，改善自然条件，去年这个一百二十多口人的小小的角田头生产队增产粮食五万斤。生产的丰收给文化室增添了光彩，社员们都说这里面有文化室的功劳。
