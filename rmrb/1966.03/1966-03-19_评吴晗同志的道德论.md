    Critique of Comrade Wu Han's Moral Theory
    Guan Feng Wu Chuanqi

    Summary: Comrade Wu Han advocates that the proletariat must inherit the morals of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. In a word, the morality of the proletariat originates from the morality of the exploiting classes, morality originates from morality, and ideas originate from ideas. This violates the basic viewpoints of historical materialism. Comrade Wu Han wants the proletariat to accept loyalty, filial piety, fidelity, righteousness, ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as well as "careful calculation and making money in every way" and democracy and freedom, and these are precisely the core and main norms of landlord and bourgeois morality. The moral core and norms of the landlord and bourgeoisie, as well as other moral concepts, have no supra-class elements. Moral norms and laws are closely linked, and the morality of the exploiting classes, like the laws of the exploiting classes, cannot be inherited at all. Using old language materials cannot be equated with inheriting the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie. To defeat the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie, it is necessary to vigorously promote the new morality of the proletariat.
  I. Refuting Comrade Wu Han's Idealist
      Theory of the Origin of Morality
    Comrade Wu Han's theory of the origin of morality is the theoretical premise for his advocacy that the proletariat must inherit the morality of the landlord class and the morality of the bourgeoisie.
    Comrade Wu Han said: "Whether it is feudal morality or bourgeois morality, the proletariat can critically absorb certain parts of it"; "If the proletariat is not good at absorbing certain excellent things from the past ruling classes, or even completely abandoning them, then it seems that it can only inherit from the ancient proletariat or create it out of thin air. The problem is that in ancient times, the proletariat did not exist, and it is unlikely to create it out of thin air." ("More on Morality")
    According to Comrade Wu Han, the historically ruled and exploited classes had no morality, so there is no question of the proletariat critically inheriting the morality of the working people in history. In another place, he clearly said: "The so-called class morality is the morality of the ruling class." ("On Morality") This means that in history there is only the morality of the ruling class, and in the field of morality, there is no division into two, no class struggle.
    According to Comrade Wu Han, the proletariat has no morality either. To have morality, it must "absorb" the morality of the landlord class and the morality of the bourgeoisie; if it abandons the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie, it is to "create it out of thin air," and "creating it out of thin air" is impossible. This means that the morality of the landlord class and the morality of the bourgeoisie are the source, and the only source, of the proletariat's moral concepts; the proletariat has neither the morality of the working people in history to critically inherit, nor can it absorb moral concepts from its own class position.
    In a word, the morality of the proletariat originates from the morality of the exploiting classes, morality originates from morality, and ideas originate from ideas. This is Comrade Wu Han's theory of the origin of morality.
    Marxism-Leninism believes that social existence determines social consciousness. Morality is a social ideology, and like other social ideologies, it is determined by social existence. This is the basic viewpoint of historical materialism.
    Engels once said:
      "If the three classes of modern society, the feudal aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat, each have their own special morality, then from this, we can only draw the conclusion that people consciously or unconsciously, ultimately, always draw their moral concepts from the actual relations on which their class position is based - that is, from the economic relations in which production and exchange are carried out."①
    That is to say, the morality of each class is determined by their class position and is formed from their social practice and class struggle. According to Comrade Wu Han, Engels' viewpoint is the "creation out of thin air" theory that should be overthrown. See, isn't what he wants to oppose the basic viewpoint of historical materialism, isn't it Marxism?
    II. Comrade Wu Han wants to make the core of landlord and bourgeois morality
            the core of communist morality
    Regarding the morality of the feudal landlord class, what does Comrade Wu Han want the proletariat to accept? What he wants the proletariat to accept are mainly loyalty, filial piety, fidelity, righteousness, ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame. And these are precisely the core and main norms of landlord class morality.
    The thinkers of the landlord class repeatedly emphasized: "The great ethics of man are, internally, father and son, externally, ruler and minister, serving the father with filial piety, and serving the ruler with loyalty." It also says: "If the minister serves the ruler, the son serves the father, and the wife serves the husband, the three are in harmony and the world is at peace, and if the three are reversed, the world is in chaos." ("Han Feizi: Loyalty and Filial Piety") Dynasties always did their best to promote "loyalty," "filial piety," and "fidelity," and to praise loyal ministers, filial sons, and chaste women, treating them as models for people, asking everyone to learn from them as examples. These are the core and highest principles of feudal morality, the so-called "Three Bonds," namely, "the ruler is the bond of the minister, the father is the bond of the son, and the husband is the bond of the wife." Other norms of landlord class morality are derived from this core.
    Ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the main moral categories for maintaining the Three Bonds and maintaining the feudal hierarchy. The "Guanzi: Shepherd People" says: "Ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are not upheld, the country will perish." The so-called "country" here refers to the feudal dynasty, the state machine of the landlord class. What is "ritual"? The thinkers of the landlord class explained it very clearly. The "Zuo Zhuan" says: "The ruler commands respectfully, the father is kind and the son is filial, the elder brother loves and the younger brother respects, the husband is harmonious and the wife is gentle, the mother-in-law is kind and the daughter-in-law listens, this is ritual." ("Zuo Zhuan" Zhao Gong Twenty-sixth Year) Song Rong and Yin Wen said: "Ascending and descending, yielding and giving way, the noble and the lowly have ranks, and the relationship between the close and the distant is called ritual." ("Guanzi: The Art of the Mind") Xunzi said: "Ritual is about having ranks for the noble and the lowly, differences for the elder and the young, and appropriate measures for the poor and the rich." ("Xunzi: On Ritual") Zheng Xuan said: "Ritual is for correcting the distinctions between ruler and minister, father and son, clarifying the order between men and women, the elder and the young, so it can bring peace to those above and transform those below." ("Commentary on the Classic of Filial Piety") Sima Guang said: "What is ritual? It is the framework. … Ritual distinguishes the noble and the lowly, orders the close and the distant, manages all things, and controls all affairs… then it is brilliantly ordered, this is the great guideline of ritual." ("Zizhi Tongjian") What is "righteousness"? Song Rong and Yin Wen said: "Righteousness means that each is in their proper place." ("Guanzi: The Art of the Mind") Mencius said: "Righteousness is the right path for people," "The essence of righteousness is following one's elder brother," "Respecting elders is righteousness," "Without ritual and righteousness, there will be chaos above and below" ("Mencius"). That is to say, "righteousness" is that people of all ranks act in accordance with the regulations of the feudal hierarchy, each fulfilling their duties and behaving properly. It is closely related to loyalty to the ruler, respect for superiors, filial piety, and brotherly love. The so-called "serving superiors by inferiors is the righteousness of ancient times," "righteousness cannot be lacking," "it is only natural" ("Collected Works of Hai Rui"). In feudal society, a servant's absolute and unconditional loyalty to his master was called "righteous servant," and even a trained dog was called a "righteous dog." What is "integrity"? Zhu Xi said: "Integrity is having discernment and not taking things casually." ("Commentary on Mencius") Although Zhu Xi said it very abstractly, when viewed in connection with the entire feudal moral system, it means strictly abiding by feudal laws, being loyal to the dynasty, and loyal to the entire interests of the landlord class; the so-called "not taking things casually" is essentially serving the feudal state. What is "shame"? The landlord class believed that not acting and thinking according to the feudal order and feudal ethical principles was shameful. Mencius said: "The heart of shame and aversion is righteousness." ("Mencius") It can be seen that shame and aversion are based on feudal ritual and righteousness.
    The feudal morality of loyalty, filial piety, fidelity, righteousness, ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are completely things that serve the landlord class, and there are no supra-class "elements" in them. However, Comrade Wu Han wants the proletariat to accept these things.
    Regarding "loyalty," Comrade Wu Han said: The proletariat should inherit the "loyalty" of feudal morality, saying "In the past, one had to be loyal to the monarch, today, shouldn't one be loyal to the country, loyal to the people, and loyal to the socialist construction cause!" ("On Morality") He also said: "'Loyalty to the monarch' is a past moral concept. Except for a few remnants of the old dynasty, no one talks about loyalty to the monarch today. Should even the word 'loyalty' be negated as a result? I don't think it should." ("Several Questions on Learning Historical Knowledge")
    May I ask: Who advocates not wanting "this 'loyalty' word"? Aren't people using this "loyalty" word frequently in speech and in writing? If it is to retain this "loyalty" word, is it necessary for Comrade Wu Han to come out and loudly call for it?
    May I ask: Is the proletariat's loyalty to the country, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the socialist construction cause inherited from the "loyalty" of landlord class morality? No. The "loyalty" of the landlord class wanted to eliminate anti-feudal movements and protect the landlord class; while the "loyalty" of the proletariat wants to overthrow the landlord class and its moral concepts. The two are completely opposite, and there is no common ground here. The proletariat's loyalty to the country, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the socialist construction cause is by no means inherited from the landlord class, but generated in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and in the socialist revolutionary struggle. Its generation and development must break the feudal landlord and bourgeois moral concepts.
    Comrade Wu Han's saying that it is necessary to retain "this 'loyalty' word" and "loyalty to the socialist construction cause" is nothing more than a deceptive technique. On the surface, it seems that the content of the landlord class's "loyalty" has been discarded, but this is an illusion. If the content of the landlord class's "loyalty" is really completely discarded, how can one talk about inheritance? Here, he is using "public prejudice" to promote feudal morality. Due to the long-term influence of feudal morality, the breaking of feudal morality is far from thorough enough. Under this circumstance, abstractly promoting the inheritance of the feudal landlord class's "loyalty" will make some people with low awareness unconsciously think of inheriting rather than breaking the content of the old morality's "loyalty." Not only that, Comrade Wu Han also made a specific explanation, saying that today's patriotism and the landlord class's "loyalty" have a historical inheritance relationship and are not "two different things" (see "Three Essays on Morality"). Clearly, isn't this asking the proletariat to inherit the content of the landlord class's "loyalty"? Where is it just about retaining a "loyalty" word?
    Comrade Wu Han's technique is nothing more than driving the content of the landlord class's "loyalty" out the front door and quietly bringing it in through the back door. The former is an illusion, and the latter is the essence.
    Regarding "filial piety," Comrade Wu Han said: The proletariat must inherit feudal "filial piety," saying "One must be good to one's parents. When parents are old and have lost their ability to work, shouldn't children take care of their parents?" ("On Morality")
    The proletariat's view of the relationship between children and parents, as well as taking care of and supporting parents, is based on the principles of proletarian revolution and derived from the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people. Nothing is inherited from the feudal morality of "filial piety" here. In order to draw a clear class line and prevent people's concepts from becoming blurred, we simply do not use the word "filial piety" to express the relationship between children and parents. This has long become a habit among revolutionary comrades.
    A son's absolute obedience to his father, the so-called "if the father tells the son to die, the son dare not not die," is the fundamental principle of feudal morality's filial piety. Does the proletariat want to inherit this principle? What communists must absolutely obey is only the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolution and the party organization. Communists handle the father-son relationship on the premise of class relations, and there is absolutely no absolute obedience of son to father.
    Feudal morality's filial piety believes that "one's body, hair, and skin are received from one's parents, and one dares not damage them, this is the beginning of filial piety; establishing oneself in the world and following the path, promoting one's name to future generations to glorify one's parents, this is the end of filial piety" ("Classic of Filial Piety"). According to this moral dogma, proletarian fighters shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for the revolution is unfilial, and completely abandoning "promoting one's name and glorifying one's parents" is also unfilial. Does this moral dogma have anything that the proletariat can inherit?
    Feudal morality's filial piety believes that "while parents are alive, one should not travel far, and if one must travel, one must have a fixed destination." According to this moral dogma, revolutionaries who "travel far" while their parents are alive and make the world their home are unfilial. Shouldn't this moral dogma also be completely abandoned?
    Feudal morality's filial piety believes that "sons concealing their fathers' misdeeds" is moral, otherwise it is unfilial. If the parents of a proletarian revolutionary have committed a crime, they must be exposed, and even if they have made a general mistake, criticism should be adopted to help them as much as possible. Isn't this completely opposite to the feudal filial piety of "sons concealing their fathers' misdeeds"?
    Feudal morality believes that having no descendants is the greatest unfilial piety. Mencius said: "There are three unfilial things, and having no descendants is the greatest." ("Mencius") Carrying on the family line is the greatest filial piety in feudalism, and only male children count, female children do not. The proletariat can only despise this kind of moral dogma.
    Regarding "fidelity," Comrade Wu Han said, "It should not be understood as the fidelity of women," but should be understood as having integrity, "Our ancestors had integrity, and people of our generation should have even more integrity" (see Comrade Wu Han's recently published "Is it Revolution or Inheritance"). Shouldn't this "having integrity" be inherited?
    However, who are the "our ancestors" that Comrade Wu Han is talking about? Which class are they? When he opposed criticizing emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, he said: "To say that all our ancestors were bad people, that the history of the motherland is completely dark, that we are all descendants of bad people,… what good is this?" ("Some Preliminary Opinions on Evaluating Historical Figures") It can be seen that the "ancestors" that Comrade Wu Han is talking about are emperors, kings, generals, ministers, and other figures of the landlord class, and the "integrity" that he wants to inherit is the "integrity" of the landlord class. The so-called "people of our generation should have even more integrity" means that "our" integrity is an extension of the landlord class's integrity, without any qualitative difference. To put it bluntly, this is to more stubbornly adhere to the exploiting class's position; his so-called "integrity" is the "Hai Rui" he created who dares to scold, "losing his official position but not yielding, not being discouraged," that is, the so-called "integrity" of opposing socialism.
    Regarding ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame, Comrade Wu Han believes that the proletariat must also inherit them. He said: "The ritual in ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame is still needed today. There can't be no politeness between people. It's wrong to enter a movie theater naked. Some young people are unkempt, have very long hair, and their clothes are extremely dirty and smelly. It is said that this is called 'simplicity.' This is probably due to a lack of ritual education?" "Righteousness, helping each other between friends, caring for each other, criticizing each other, isn't this very appropriate?" "Integrity, do we need integrity? Do we need to cherish state property?… Public and private must be distinguished, and public things must not be occupied. We should have such a virtue. Shame, don't do bad things. I think these morals of the old era should all be critically inherited and applied to today." ("Several Questions on Learning Historical Knowledge")
    Listen, Comrade Wu Han is lecturing us using the "ritual" of feudal morality: If we don't accept the "ritual" of feudal morality, then we can only be barbarians, those who will "enter a movie theater naked." Comrade Wu Han couldn't help but burst into scolding. May I ask, who advocates being unkempt, having very long hair, and having extremely dirty and smelly clothes, and calling this "simplicity"? Probably in Comrade Wu Han's eyes, the working people are all smelly. After scolding us, he praised the "ritual" of the landlord class and insisted that the proletariat accept it.
    Please, is the mutual help, mutual care, and mutual criticism among revolutionary friends inherited from the "righteousness" of feudal morality? Is there any mutual care or mutual criticism in feudal "righteousness"? "A scholar dies for his confidant" is one aspect of feudal "righteousness," but don't we have to absolutely abandon it? Communists can only die for the revolution, for the interests of the people, and never for any "confidant" or any individual or small group.
      "Cherishing state property" and "distinguishing between public and private and not occupying public things" are generated from the economic foundation of the system of ownership by the whole people and the collective ownership system, and are derived from the interests of the revolution. The popularization of this virtue is the result of the party's political education work. It is definitely not inherited from the landlord class's moral dogmas. According to Comrade Wu Han's logic, if the proletariat does not inherit the "integrity" of the landlord class, it will steal state property and engage in corruption. Isn't this slander against the proletariat?
      "Don't do bad things," is this inherited from the feudal moral dogmas? Each class has its own standards for what is good and what is bad, and the same is true for shame and glory. What the landlord class considers bad and shameful, we consider good and glorious. How can the proletariat inherit the moral dogma of "shame" from the landlord class? According to Comrade Wu Han's logic, if the proletariat does not accept this moral dogma, it will only do bad things!?
    Here, Comrade Wu Han uses the technique of labeling the morality of the landlord class with the names of socialist morality. The reason he wants to do this is to dress up the feudal rituals, righteousness, integrity, and shame as something that seems acceptable and should be accepted, so as to facilitate their sale. What "critically inheriting," what "helping each other," "criticizing each other," what "distinguishing between public and private," "cherishing state property," etc., are just some confusing terms and phrases.
    Regarding bourgeois morality, what does Comrade Wu Han want the proletariat to accept? What he wants the proletariat to accept are mainly the bourgeoisie's "careful calculation, making money in every way" and democracy and freedom. And these are precisely the core and main norms of bourgeois morality.
    Regarding the core of bourgeois morality, Comrade Wu Han believes that the proletariat must inherit it. He said: "Not only feudal morality, but also bourgeois morality, careful calculation, making money in every way, shouldn't it become an important principle for socialist management of enterprises?"
    See, isn't this clearly treating the bourgeois management principle of making money as a principle for socialist management of enterprises, as proletarian morality?
    The purpose of production and management activities of socialist enterprises is to serve politics and the masses, and definitely not to make money. Of course, socialist enterprises also talk about "profit" under the above premise, and also strive to practice thrift, improve labor efficiency, and reduce production costs, but definitely not to treat "making money in every way" as a principle and policy. Comrade Li Suwen, a commercial worker, said: "Serving the people is infinite," "Being at the counter, one should have the whole country in mind and the world in view." This is the worldview and morality of a communist commercial worker. Is this noble character inherited from the bourgeois morality of "making money in every way"? No, absolutely not. It is the result of Mao Zedong Thought education, it is the result of the struggle against the bourgeois money morality. In recent years, our party has led enterprise employees to widely carry out the struggle between two management ideologies within enterprises. This is a struggle to overcome the capitalist management ideology and management style that still exist in enterprises, and it is also a struggle to educate and transform people with the communist worldview and morality. Comrade Wu Han, however, forcibly stuffs the so-called "morality" of the bourgeoisie's "making money in every way" to the proletariat. What is this for?
    Obviously, Comrade Wu Han wants the proletariat to inherit the bourgeoisie's "careful calculation, making money in every way," which is to inherit the core of bourgeois morality - egoism, individualism, which is to inherit the bourgeoisie's money morality; and in essence, it is still to change the purpose of production and management policies of socialist enterprises, and to promote putting money first and profits first.
    Comrade Wu Han also takes the bourgeoisie's democracy and freedom, as political and moral categories, for the proletariat to inherit. He said: "The two concepts of democracy and freedom, in the early days of the rise of the bourgeoisie, had progressive significance in resisting the shackles of the feudal system. But as the bourgeoisie grew stronger and grasped political power, democracy was only bourgeois democracy, and there was no democracy for the people, and the same was true for freedom. In this way, democracy and freedom also changed their nature. Since there has been a proletariat, since there has been Marxism-Leninism, since socialist countries have been established, should these two concepts of democracy and freedom be critically inherited?" Then he also said that our democracy and freedom are the people's democracy and the people's freedom (it is not difficult for discerning people to see that these are just words to cover up the truth), but he asserted that the proletariat inherited the bourgeoisie's democracy and freedom.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There is only concrete freedom, concrete democracy, there is no abstract freedom, abstract democracy. In a class-struggle society, if there is the freedom for the exploiting class to exploit the working people, then there is no freedom for the working people to be free from exploitation. If there is bourgeois democracy, then there is no democracy for the proletariat and the working people."②
    The bourgeoisie's democracy and freedom, not only after the bourgeoisie "grasped political power," are only the bourgeoisie's democracy and the bourgeoisie's freedom; but also in the "early days of the rise" of the bourgeoisie, the two concepts of democracy and freedom created by their thinkers are also bourgeois, and there is not a single bit of national, supra-class content. At this time, the two concepts of democracy and freedom, on the one hand, are the bourgeoisie's "resistance to the shackles of the feudal system"; on the other hand, they are a deception of the working people. Because at this time, the two concepts of democracy and freedom are components of the bourgeois worldview and are weapons for striving to establish the bourgeois dictatorship. Comrade Wu Han only talks about the side of democracy and freedom "resisting the shackles of the feudal system" in the "early days of the rise" of the bourgeoisie, and avoids talking about their bourgeois content and their side of deceiving the working people. This is precisely to make the proletariat completely accept the bourgeoisie's democracy and freedom.
    Bourgeois democracy, whether as a political system or as a system of thought, is, for the working people, "hypocritical, deceptive democracy, a paradise for the rich, and a trap and a fraud for the poor and the exploited"③. Bourgeois democracy as a political system is bourgeois dictatorship, and as a system of ideas, it is the theoretical basis of bourgeois dictatorship. The bourgeoisie's democracy only gives democracy to the capitalists, and exercises dictatorship over the proletariat and other working people; the proletariat's democracy only gives democracy to the working people and those who support the socialist revolution, and exercises dictatorship over the bourgeoisie who oppose the socialist revolution. From the perspective of moral concepts, the bourgeoisie believes that it is moral to deceive the people with the slogan of national democracy, and that it is moral for their various groups and their representatives to fight each other for power and profit under the slogan of democracy; the proletariat believes that it is moral to exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie who oppose the socialist revolution, and that people who implement democratic centralism within the people and have proletarian communist morality must strictly abide by democratic centralism. Obviously, the two are incompatible.
    The bourgeoisie's freedom is freedom of trade, is the freedom for capitalists to exploit workers. The bourgeoisie believes that it is moral to exploit workers, and that it is moral for them to crush each other, deceive each other, and cheat each other under the slogan of free trade. We believe that this is extremely dirty and extremely immoral. The proletariat's freedom is only given to the people, and never to the reactionaries. The proletariat believes that it is moral to eliminate capital and eliminate exploitation, and not give it half a point of freedom, and that within the people, freedom is also relative to discipline, and that it is moral to act according to the principle of "unity of freedom and discipline." The reactionaries, however, scold us for not having freedom and not wanting morality. See, isn't the proletariat's freedom completely opposite to the bourgeoisie's freedom?
    Using the morality of the exploiting classes to transform the spiritual outlook of the proletariat, this is the secret of Comrade Wu Han's moral theory.
  III. The Proletariat Must Completely Abandon the Moral Concepts of the Exploiting Classes
    When Comrade Wu Han was proving that the proletariat must inherit the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie, he said: "Didn't Lenin say: 'Proletarian culture is not something that falls from the sky, nor is it fabricated by those who call themselves proletarian culture experts. This is complete nonsense. Proletarian culture should be the inevitable result of the development of all the knowledge created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist, landlord, and bureaucratic societies.' (Lenin: "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues") In a broad category, morality belongs to the scope of culture." ("More on Morality")
    This is a great distortion of Lenin.
    Lenin always divided the culture created in exploiting class societies into two. He said: "In every national culture, there are two national cultures"④, one is the reactionary culture, and the other is the culture of the masses of the people. Comrade Wu Han, however, equates "all the knowledge created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist, landlord, and bureaucratic societies" with bourgeois culture and landlord class culture. Isn't this a distortion of Lenin?
    In Volume 31 of "The Complete Works of Lenin," pages 253-254, Lenin discussed how Marx critically inherited the cultural heritage of human history when he created communist theory. He pointed out: Marx re-examined all the historical heritage, "criticized it, and tested it one by one according to the practice of the workers' movement, and then came to conclusions that people limited by bourgeois narrowness or shackled by bourgeois prejudice could not reach." The passage from Lenin that Comrade Wu Han quoted is on page 254. Starting from page 257, Lenin began to discuss the issue of morality. Lenin's entire discussion of the issue of morality in this article not only did not say to inherit the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie, but also said that we must abandon the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie; and pointed out that "our morality is derived from the interests of the proletarian class struggle." Comrade Wu Han, however, in the name of Lenin, said that the morality of the proletariat originates from the morality of the exploiting classes, and that the proletariat must inherit the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie. May I ask: What kind of morality is Comrade Wu Han's method of quoting?
    Regarding the literature, art, philosophy, economics, etc. of the landlord and bourgeoisie, we must of course critically inherit them, that is, as Chairman Mao said, discard its dross and absorb its essence. However, the moral concepts and moral norms of the landlord and bourgeoisie are different from the above ideological heritage. Classical writers have never said to inherit the moral concepts and moral norms of the landlord and bourgeoisie. Comrade Wu Han used "In a broad category, morality belongs to the scope of culture" to prove that the proletariat must inherit the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie. This is futile. Broadly speaking, legal norms and laws also belong to the scope of culture, do we also want to inherit the laws of the landlord and bourgeoisie, do we also want to inherit the "Six Codes" of the Kuomintang reactionaries? Marxism believes that the bourgeois state machine must be smashed. This includes smashing and completely abandoning bourgeois law.
    In the superstructure, moral concepts and norms are different from philosophy, economics, literature, and art. Philosophy and economics are abstract reflections of social existence, and literature and art are reflections of social existence using artistic images; while moral concepts and norms, like legal norms and laws, are the sum of people's behavioral rules. Laws and legal norms are behavioral rules (statute law and customary law) formulated or recognized by state organs and enforced by violent organs; morality regulates people's behavior through social opinion.
    Moral concepts and norms are closely linked to laws, which is particularly evident in Chinese feudal society. Many moral dogmas are directly written into legal provisions. For example, the "Tang Code" and the "Ming Code" stipulated that disloyalty, unfilial piety, and infidelity were all major crimes that were "unforgivable"; the "Han Code," "Tang Code," and "Ming Code" stipulated: "Relatives should be able to conceal each other's crimes," which means that moral dogmas such as "sons concealing their fathers' misdeeds" are also laws.
    Although morality and law are different, it is, after all, like law, the sum of people's behavioral rules. The morality and laws of the exploiting classes are behavioral rules formed according to the will of the exploiting classes and directly oppress the working people; its function is to directly serve the consolidation of the social order of the exploiting classes. Therefore, the morality of the exploiting classes, like the laws of the exploiting classes, cannot be inherited at all.
    In addition to the moral core and main norms of the landlord and bourgeoisie, Comrade Wu Han also put forward some other moral concepts for the proletariat to inherit. Here, we select the main ones to discuss.
    Comrade Wu Han wants us to inherit the spirit of the great man said by Mencius. Mencius said: "To walk the great path of the world, to achieve one's ambition and lead the people, to not achieve one's ambition and walk one's own path alone, wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue." ("Mencius: Teng Wengong II") Comrade Wu Han quoted this passage, wanting the proletariat to inherit it, and said, "In the near and modern revolutionary history, there have also been countless martyrs and heroes who meet this standard."
    Please, isn't the "path" that Mencius is talking about the "path" of the feudal landlord class? Mencius's "wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue" is based on the "path" of the landlord class as a premise, that is, no matter the temptation of wealth and honor, the torment of poverty and lowliness, or the oppression of strong power, never change the spirit of implementing the "path" of the landlord class, this is the so-called virtue of a great man. What is expressed here is the stubborn party spirit of the landlord class. For example, now a landlord class element says: "Wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue, and I must walk my own path (that is, adhere to the landlord class's position) until death," isn't this extremely reactionary? How can this so-called morality have anything that the proletariat can inherit?
    According to Comrade Wu Han, modern proletarian revolutionary heroes inherited the morality of the landlord class and are the result of Mencius's thought education. Isn't this extremely absurd? Sometimes, we also borrow "wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue" to explain the revolutionary firmness of proletarian fighters. This is by no means saying that the proletariat inherited the moral concepts of the landlord class, but only borrowing language materials from Mencius. The revolutionary firmness of proletarian fighters is by no means derived from the morality of the landlord and bourgeoisie, but formed in the revolutionary struggle, under the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    When Comrade Wu Han was arguing that feudal morality must be inherited, he also said: "Honesty, diligence, courage, hard work, and lofty aspirations, can't these virtues all be transferred and used today?"
    Please, is there any abstract "honesty," "courage," or "lofty aspirations"? The "honesty" talked about in landlord class morality is being loyal to the landlord class, being honest with the landlord class; the honesty talked about in proletarian morality is being loyal to the party, being loyal to the people, being honest with the party and the people. If you are also "honest" in the enemy's court, that is a traitor who betrays the party's secrets. The "courage" talked about in landlord class morality is linked to maintaining the interests of the landlord class. In feudal society, the executioner who suppressed peasant uprisings was praised by the landlord class as "commendably loyal and brave" and morally noble. Today, in the proletarian dictatorship, landlord class elements still talk about the "courage" of their class, which is stubbornness and opposition to the proletarian dictatorship; the courage talked about in proletarian morality is fearlessness in the struggle against the landlord and bourgeoisie, bravely killing enemies and risking one's life in the revolutionary war. The "lofty aspirations" of the landlord class are vast fortunes, wealth and honor, or individual careerists vying for power and profit, which in the era of the proletarian dictatorship means restoring the rule of the landlord and bourgeoisie; the lofty aspirations of the proletariat are to build China into a great socialist power, to completely eliminate exploitation and classes in China and the world, and to realize communism. "Honesty," "courage," "lofty aspirations," etc. are completely concrete and class-based. The proletariat's honesty, courage, and lofty aspirations are diametrically opposed to the landlord class's "honesty," "courage," and "lofty aspirations," how can the landlord class's "honesty," "courage," and "lofty aspirations" be "transferred and used today"?
    As for "diligence" and "hard work," these are simply not the morality of the landlord class.
  "Diligence" and "hard work" are always linked to labor. They are the virtues of the working people. The landlord class is a parasitic class that does not work and obtains benefits without labor. They believe that labor is shameful and something that lowly people do. They do not have and cannot have the virtues of "diligence" and "hard work." Comrade Wu Han is hanging the virtues of "diligence" and "hard work" that only the working people can have on the head of the landlord class. Isn't this blatantly promoting that the landlord class started by being "diligent, thrifty," and hardworking?
    Comrade Wu Han also promotes the landlord class's "unyielding integrity," calling it supra-class and forcing the proletariat to accept it. This is also completely deceiving. There is no such thing as supra-class "unyielding integrity." The so-called "unyielding integrity," for the landlord, fundamentally speaking, is adhering to the

    评吴晗同志的道德论
    关锋　吴传启
    提要　吴晗同志主张无产阶级必须继承地主阶级、资产阶级的道德。一句话，无产阶级的道德来源于剥削阶级的道德，道德来源于道德，观念来源于观念。这是违反历史唯物主义的基本观点的。吴晗同志要无产阶级接受忠、孝、节、义、礼、义、廉、耻，以及“精打细算，多方赚钱”和民主、自由，而这些正是地主资产阶级的道德核心和主要规范。地主资产阶级的道德核心和规范以及其他道德观念没有任何超阶级的因素。道德规范和法律是紧密联系在一起的，剥削阶级的道德和剥削阶级的法律一样，是根本不能继承的。不能把利用旧有的语言资料，说成是继承地主资产阶级道德。要战胜地主资产阶级的道德，必须大力发扬无产阶级的新道德。
  一、驳吴晗同志的唯心
      主义道德来源论
    吴晗同志的道德来源论，是他主张无产阶级必须继承地主阶级道德、资产阶级道德的理论前提。
    吴晗同志说：“无论是封建道德，还是资产阶级道德，无产阶级都可以批判地吸取其中某些部分”；“无产阶级若不善于吸取过去统治阶级某些优良的东西，甚至完全摒弃，那么，看来只有向古代的无产阶级继承，或者自己来凭空创造了。问题是在古代，无产阶级并不存在，自己凭空创造呢，也不大可能。”（《再说道德》）
    照吴晗同志说来，历史上被统治、被剥削的阶级是没有道德的，所以也就没有无产阶级批判地继承历史上劳动人民的道德的问题。在另一个地方，他明白地说：“所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德。”（《说道德》）这就是说，历史上只有统治阶级的道德，在道德领域里，没有一分为二，没有阶级斗争。
    照吴晗同志说来，无产阶级也是没有道德的，要使自己有道德，就必须“吸取”地主阶级道德、资产阶级道德；如果摒弃地主资产阶级道德，那就是要“凭空创造”，而“凭空创造”是不可能的。这就是说，地主阶级的道德、资产阶级的道德是无产阶级道德观念的源泉，并且是唯一的来源；无产阶级既没有历史上劳动人民的道德可供批判继承，又不能从自己的阶级地位中吸取道德观念。
    一句话，无产阶级的道德来源于剥削阶级道德，道德来源于道德，观念来源于观念。这就是吴晗同志的道德来源论。
    马克思列宁主义认为，社会存在决定社会意识。道德是一种社会意识形态，它同其他社会意识形态一样，是由社会存在决定的。这是历史唯物主义的基本观点。
    恩格斯曾经说道：
      “如果近代社会的三个阶级封建贵族、资产阶级和无产阶级各有自己的特殊的道德，那么从这上面，我们只能得出这样的结论，即人们自觉地或不自觉地，归根到底总是从他们阶级地位所依据的实际关系中——就是说从生产和交换所依以进行的经济关系中，吸取自己的道德观念。”①
    这也就是说，各个阶级的道德都是由他们的阶级地位决定的，是从他们的社会实践和阶级斗争中形成的。照吴晗同志说来，恩格斯的观点就是应该被打倒的“凭空创造”论。请看，他所要反对的不正是历史唯物主义的基本观点，不正是马克思主义吗？
    二、吴晗同志要把地主资产阶级道德的核心当
            作共产主义道德的核心
    对于封建地主阶级的道德，吴晗同志要无产阶级接受什么呢？他要无产阶级接受的，主要的就是忠、孝、节、义、礼、义、廉、耻。而这一些，正是地主阶级道德的核心和主要规范。
    地主阶级的思想家一再强调：“人之大伦，内则父子，外则君臣，事父以孝，事君以忠。”又说：“臣事君，子事父，妻事夫，三者顺则天下治，三者逆则天下乱。”（《韩非子·忠孝》）历代的封建王朝，总是尽力宣传“忠”、“孝”、“节”，表彰忠臣、孝子、节妇，把他（她）们当作人的楷模，要大家当作榜样来学习。这一些是封建道德的核心和最高原则，也就是所谓“三纲”，即“君为臣纲，父为子纲，夫为妻纲”。地主阶级道德的其他规范，都是从这个核心派生出来的。
    礼、义、廉、耻是维护三纲、维护封建等级制度的主要道德范畴。《管子·牧民篇》说过：“礼义廉耻，国之四维，四维不张，国乃灭亡。”这里所谓的“国”就是封建王朝，就是地主阶级的国家机器。什么是“礼”呢？地主阶级的思想家讲得很清楚。《左传》上说：“君令臣恭，父慈子孝，兄爱弟敬，夫和妻柔，姑慈妇听，礼也。”（《左传》昭公二十六年）宋荣、尹文说：“登降揖让，贵贱有等，亲疏之体谓之礼。”（《管子·心术上》）荀子说：“礼者，贵贱有等，长幼有差，贫富轻重皆有称者也。”（《荀子·礼论》）郑玄说：“礼所以正君臣父子之别，明男女长幼之序，故可以安上化下也。”（《孝经注》司马光说：“何谓礼？纪纲是也。……夫礼辨贵贱，序亲疏，裁群物，制庶事……然后粲然有伦，此礼之大经也。”（《资治通鉴》）什么是“义”呢？宋荣、尹文说：“义者，谓各处其宜也。”（《管子·心术上》）孟子说：“义者，人之正路也”，“义之实，从兄是也”，“敬长，义也”，“无礼义，则上下乱”（《孟子》）。这就是说，“义”就是各个等级的人，按照封建等级制度的规定，各自尽伦尽职，规规矩矩地行事，它是和忠君、敬上、孝悌密切联系的，所谓“以下事上，古之义也”，“义不可缺”，“理所当然”（《海瑞集》）。在封建社会里，仆人绝对地、无条件地忠于主人，叫做“义仆”，甚至把驯犬叫做“义犬”。什么是“廉”呢？朱熹说：“廉，有分辨，不苟取也。”（《孟子注》）尽管朱熹说得很抽象，但是同整个的封建道德体系联系起来看，就是严守封建法律、忠于王朝、忠于地主阶级的整个利益；所谓“不苟取”实质上也是为封建国家服务的东西。什么是“耻”呢？地主阶级认为不按着封建秩序和封建伦理纲常行事和思想，就是可耻的。孟子就说过：“羞恶之心，义也。”（《孟子》）可见，羞恶、羞耻，是以封建的礼义等等为基础的。
    封建道德的忠孝节义和礼义廉耻，完完全全是为地主阶级服务的东西，其中没有任何超阶级的“元素”。可是，吴晗同志竟要无产阶级把这些东西接受下来。
    关于“忠”，吴晗同志说：无产阶级要继承封建道德的“忠”，说什么“过去要忠于君主，今天呢，难道不应该忠于国家，忠于人民，忠于社会主义建设事业！”（《说道德》）又说：“‘忠君’，是过去的道德观念，除了个别遗老外，今天没有人讲忠君了，是不是连带这个‘忠’字也应该否定呢？我看不应该。”（《学习历史知识的几个问题》）
    试问：有谁主张不要“这个‘忠’字”呢？人们在口头上，在文章里不是经常使用这个“忠”字吗？如果是为了保留这个
  “忠”字，那里用得着吴晗同志出来大声疾呼呢？
    试问：无产阶级忠于国家、忠于人民、忠于社会主义建设事业，难道是从地主阶级道德的“忠”继承来的吗？不。地主阶级的“忠”要消灭反封建的运动，保卫地主阶级；而无产阶级的“忠”则要打倒地主阶级及其道德观念。两者是完全相反的，这里没有丝毫的共同点。无产阶级忠于国家、忠于人民、忠于社会主义建设事业，绝不是从地主阶级那里继承来的，而是在反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中，在社会主义革命斗争中产生的。它的产生和发展，非要破除封建地主资产阶级道德观念不可。
    吴晗同志说什么要保留“这个‘忠’字”，“忠于社会主义建设事业”云云，不过是骗人的手法。表面看来，似乎把地主阶级“忠”的内容都舍掉了，然而这是假象。如果真的把地主阶级“忠”的内容完全舍掉，继承又从何谈起呢？在这里，他是利用“公众成见”来宣扬封建道德。由于封建道德的长期影响，对于封建道德破除得还远远不够彻底，在这种情况下，抽象地宣扬继承封建地主阶级的“忠”，就会使一些觉悟不高的人，不知不觉地想到去继承而不是破除旧道德的“忠”的内容。不仅如此，吴晗同志还作了具体交代，他说：今天的爱国主义和地主阶级的“忠”有历史继承关系，并且不是“两码子事”（见《三说道德》）。明明白白，这不是要无产阶级继承地主阶级“忠”的内容吗？哪里只是要保留一个“忠”字呢？
    吴晗同志的手法不过是，把地主阶级“忠”的内容从前门赶出去，从后门悄悄地引进来。前者是假象，后者是本质。
    关于“孝”，吴晗同志说：无产阶级必须继承封建的“孝”，说什么“对父母要好，父母年老了，丧失劳动力了，子女难道不应该照顾父母？”（《说道德》）
    无产阶级关于子女对父母的关系，以及照顾父母、赡养父母，是建立在无产阶级革命原则的基础上的，是从全心全意为人民服务的原则派生出来的。这里并没有从封建道德的“孝”继承什么东西。为了划清阶级界限，不使人们的观念模糊，我们根本不用“孝”这个词来表达子女和父母的关系。这一点，在革命同志之间早已成为习惯了。
    儿子对父亲绝对服从，所谓“父叫子死，子不敢不死”，这是封建道德孝的根本原则。难道无产阶级要继承这条原则吗？共产主义者所要绝对服从的，只是无产阶级革命的根本利益、党的组织。共产党人是在阶级关系的前提下处理父子关系的，绝没有什么儿子对父亲的绝对服从。
    封建道德的孝认为，“身体发肤，受之父母，不敢毁伤，孝之始也；立身行道，扬名于后世以显父母，孝之终也”（《孝经》）。按着这个道德教条，无产阶级战士为革命而流血牺牲，就是不孝，彻底摒弃“扬名声，显父母”，也是不孝。难道这个道德教条，有无产阶级可以继承的东西吗？
    封建道德的孝认为，“父母在，不远游，游必有方”。按着这个道德教条，革命者父母在而“远游”，以四海为家，就是不孝。对于这个道德教条，不也是应该完全摒弃吗？
    封建道德的孝认为，“子为父隐”是合乎道德的，否则就是不孝。无产阶级革命者，如果自己的父母犯了罪，必须揭发，就是犯了一般性的错误，也要采取批评的方法，尽可能地给以帮助。这跟“子为父隐”的封建孝道，不是截然相反吗？
    封建道德认为，绝后是最大的不孝。孟子说：“不孝有三，无后为大。”（《孟子》）传宗接代是封建的最大孝道，并且只有男孩子才成，女孩子是不算数的。无产阶级对这种道德教条，当然只能唾弃。
    关于“节”，吴晗同志说，“不应理解为妇女守节的节”，而应该理解为有骨气，“我们的祖先是有骨气的，我们这一代的人更要有骨气”（见吴晗同志最近发表的《是革命，还是继承》），这
  “有骨气”，难道不应该继承吗？
    可是，吴晗同志所说的“我们的祖先”是谁呢？是哪个阶级呢？他在反对批判帝王将相的时候说：“把我们的祖宗全说成是坏人，祖国的历史漆黑一团，我们全是坏人的子孙，……这有什么好处呢？”（《关于评价历史人物的一些初步意见》）可见，吴晗同志所说的“祖先”就是帝王将相等地主阶级的人物，他要继承的“骨气”就是地主阶级的“骨气”。所谓“我们这一代的人更要有骨气”，就是说“我们”的骨气是地主阶级的骨气的扩大，而没有质上的任何区别。说穿了，这就是要更顽固地坚持剥削阶级立场；他所谓的“骨气”，就是他塑造的“海瑞”的敢骂，“丢了官并不屈服，不丧气”，就是反社会主义的所谓“骨气”。
    关于礼义廉耻，吴晗同志认为，无产阶级也必须继承。他说：“礼义廉耻中的礼，今天还是要的，人与人之间不能一点礼貌也没有，光着身子进电影院是不对的。有些青年人，不修边幅，头发留得好长，衣服脏极了，臭烘烘的，据说这样才叫做‘朴素’，这恐怕是缺乏礼的教育所致吧？”“义，朋友之间互相帮助，彼此爱护，互相批评，这不是很应该吗？”“廉，要不要廉洁？要不要爱护国家财物？……公私要分清楚，不可占用公家的东西，应该有这样的品德。耻，不好的事不要去做。旧时代的这些道德，我看都应该批判地继承应用于今天。”（《学习历史知识的几个问题》）
    请听，吴晗同志用封建道德的“礼”对我们进行说教了：如果不接受封建道德的“礼”，那就只能是野蛮的人，那是会“光着身子进电影院”的。吴晗同志禁不住破口大骂了。试问，有谁提倡不修边幅，头发留得好长，衣服脏极了，臭烘烘的，并把这叫做“朴素”呢？大概在吴晗眼里，劳动人民都臭烘烘的。他骂了我们一顿之后，把地主阶级的“礼”捧了出来，非要无产阶级接受不可。
    请问：革命的朋友之间互相帮助，彼此爱护，互相批评，难道是从封建道德的“义”继承来的吗？封建的“义”，有什么彼此爱护，互相批评吗？“士为知己者死”，倒是封建的“义”的一个内容，可是我们对它不是必须绝对摒弃吗？共产主义者只能为革命而死，为人民的利益而死，绝不能为什么“知己”、为任何个人和小集团而死。
      “爱护国家财产”，“公私分明，不占用公家的东西”，这是从全民所有制和集体所有制的经济基础中产生的，是从革命的利益引伸出来的，这种品德的普及是党的政治教育工作的结果。它决不是从地主阶级的道德教条中继承来的。照吴晗同志的逻辑，无产阶级如果不继承地主阶级的“廉”，就会盗窃国家财物、假公济私。难道这不是对无产阶级的诽谤吗？
      “不好的事不要去做”，难道是从封建的道德教条那里继承来的吗？什么是好事，什么是坏事，各阶级都有自己的标准，耻辱与光荣也是这样。地主阶级认为坏的、可耻的事，我们则认为是好的、光荣的。无产阶级怎么能继承地主阶级“耻”这个道德教条呢？照吴晗同志的逻辑，无产阶级如果不接受这个道德教条，就要尽做坏事了！？
    在这里，吴晗同志采用的手法，是把地主阶级的道德，贴上社会主义道德名词的标签。他所以要这样做，是为了把封建的礼义廉耻打扮成似乎可以而且应该接受的东西，以便于推销它们。什么“批判地继承”啊，什么“互相帮助”、“互相批评”啊，什么“公私分明”、“爱护国家财产”啊，等等，都只不过是一些迷惑人的名词术语而已。
    关于资产阶级道德，吴晗同志要无产阶级接受什么呢？他要无产阶级接受的，主要的就是资产阶级的“精打细算，多方赚钱”和民主、自由。而这一些恰恰是资产阶级道德的核心和主要规范。
    对于资产阶级道德的核心，吴晗同志认为，无产阶级必须继承。他说：“不止是封建道德，就是资产阶级的道德，精打细算，多方赚钱，难道不应该成为社会主义经营管理企业的一条重要原则？”
    请看，这不是明明要把为了赚钱的资产阶级经营原则也当作社会主义经营管理企业的原则、当作无产阶级道德吗？
    社会主义企业生产和经营活动的目的，是为政治服务，为群众服务，而决不是为了赚钱。当然，社会主义企业在上述前提下也讲“利润”，也要力求厉行节约，提高劳动效率，降低生产成本，但决不是把“多方赚钱”当作原则方针。商业工作者李素文同志说：“为人民服务是无限的”，“身在柜台，胸怀全国，放眼世界”。这是一个共产主义商业工作者的世界观和道德观。这种高尚品德难道是从“多方赚钱”的资产阶级道德观那里继承来的吗？不是，绝对不是。它是毛泽东思想教育的结果，它是和资产阶级的金钱道德斗争的结果。几年来，我们党领导企业职工在企业内部广泛地开展了两种经营思想的斗争，这是为了克服企业中残存的资本主义经营思想、经营作风的斗争，也是用共产主义世界观道德观教育人、改造人的斗争。吴晗同志却把资产阶级“多方赚钱”的所谓“道德”硬塞给无产阶级，这究竟是为了什么呢？
    很显然，吴晗同志要无产阶级继承资产阶级的“精打细算，多方赚钱”，就是要继承资产阶级道德的核心——利己主义、个人主义，就是要继承资产阶级的金钱道德；并且实质上还是要改变社会主义企业生产的目的和经营方针，提倡钞票挂帅、利润挂帅。
    吴晗同志还把资产阶级的民主、自由，作为政治范畴和道德范畴，要无产阶级继承下来。他说：“民主、自由这两个概念，在资产阶级兴起初期，对反抗封建制度的束缚来说是具有进步意义的。但随着资产阶级的成长壮大，掌握了政权，民主只是资产阶级的民主，对人民是没有民主的，自由也是一样。这样，民主和自由也就变了质了。自从有了无产阶级之后，有了马列主义之后，建立了社会主义国家之后，民主和自由这两个概念是不是批判地继承下来呢？”接着他也说，我们的民主、自由是人民的民主、人民的自由（明眼人不难看出，这不过是掩盖真相的词句），但是他却断言无产阶级继承了资产阶级的民主、自由。
    毛泽东同志说：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”②
    资产阶级的民主、自由，不仅在资产阶级“掌握了政权”之后，只是资产阶级的民主、资产阶级的自由；就是在资产阶级
  “兴起初期”，他的思想家所创造的民主、自由这两个概念，也是资产阶级的，绝没有一点全民的、超阶级的内容。在这个时候，民主、自由这两个概念，一方面是资产阶级“反抗封建制度的束缚”；另一方面又是对劳动人民的欺骗。因为，这时民主、自由这两个概念是资产阶级世界观的组成部分，是争取建立资产阶级专政的武器。吴晗同志只谈资产阶级“兴起初期”民主、自由“反抗封建制度束缚”的一面避而不谈它们的资产阶级内容，它们欺骗劳动人民的一面。这正是为了要无产阶级把资产阶级的民主、自由，完全接受下来。
    资产阶级民主，无论作为政治制度来说，还是作为思想体系来说，对于劳动人民，都是“虚伪的、骗人的民主，对富人是天堂，对穷人和被剥削者是陷阱和骗局”③。资产阶级民主作为政治制度就是资产阶级专政，作为观念体系就是资产阶级专政的理论基础。资产阶级的民主，只把民主给予资本家，对无产阶级和其他劳动人民则实行专政；无产阶级的民主，只把民主给予劳动人民以及拥护社会主义革命的人们，对反对社会主义革命的资产阶级则实行专政。从道德观念方面来说，资产阶级认为用全民民主的口号欺骗人民是道德的，它们各个集团及其代表人物，在民主的口号下，互相争权夺利，是道德的；无产阶级认为，对反对社会主义革命的资产阶级实行专政，在人民内部实行民主集中制，具有无产阶级共产主义道德的人们，一定是严格遵守民主集中制的。很显然，两者是水火不相容的。
    资产阶级的自由就是贸易自由，就是资本家剥削工人的自由。资产阶级认为，剥削工人是道德的，他们在自由贸易的口号下，互相倾轧，尔虞我诈，是道德的。我们认为，这是极其污浊、极不道德的。无产阶级的自由只给予人民，绝不给予反动派。无产阶级认为，消灭资本、消灭剥削，不给它半点自由，是道德的，认为在人民内部，自由也是对纪律而言的，按着“自由和纪律的统一”这个原则行动，才是道德的。而反动派则骂我们没有自由，不要道德。请看，无产阶级的自由跟资产阶级的自由不是完全相反的吗？
    用剥削阶级的道德，改造无产阶级的精神面貌，这就是吴晗同志的道德论的秘密。
  三、无产阶级必须彻底摒弃剥削阶级的道德观念
    吴晗同志在论证无产阶级必须继承地主资产阶级道德时说：“列宁不是说过吗？‘无产阶级文化并不是从天上掉下来的，也不是那些自命为无产阶级文化专家的人杜撰出来的。这完全是胡说。无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会和官僚社会压迫下创造出来的全部知识发展的必然结果。’（列宁：《青年团的任务》）在广义的范畴来说，道德是属于文化范围的。”（《再说道德》）
    这是对列宁的极大歪曲。
    列宁总是把在剥削阶级社会里创造出来的文化一分为二。他说：“每一种民族文化中，都有两种民族文化”④，一种是反动的文化，一种是人民大众的文化。而吴晗同志却在“人类在资本主义社会、地主社会和官僚社会压迫下创造出来的全部知识”和资产阶级文化、地主阶级文化之间划上一个等号。难道这不是对列宁的歪曲吗？
    在《列宁全集》第三一卷第二五三——二五四页，列宁论述马克思在创立共产主义理论的时候，批判地继承了人类历史上的文化遗产。他指出：马克思对历史上的文化遗产，“都重新探讨过，批判过，根据工人运动的实践一一检验过，于是就得出了那些被资产阶级狭隘性所限制或被资产阶级偏见束缚住的人所不能得出的结论”。吴晗同志所引的列宁的那段话，就在二五四页上。从二五七页开始，列宁才开始论述道德问题。列宁在这篇文章里对道德问题的全部论述，不但没有说继承地主资产阶级道德，而且说我们必须摒弃地主资产阶级道德；并且指出，“我们的道德是从无产阶级阶级斗争的利益中引伸出来的”。吴晗同志却假借列宁的名义说，无产阶级的道德来源于剥削阶级的道德，无产阶级必须继承地主资产阶级道德。试问：吴晗同志的这种引证法又是哪一种道德呢？
    对于地主资产阶级的文学、艺术、哲学、经济学等等，我们当然要批判地继承，即如毛主席所说的，剔除其糟粕，吸收其精华。但是，地主资产阶级的道德观念和道德规范，却同上述思想遗产不同。经典作家都没说过继承地主资产阶级的道德观念和道德规范。吴晗同志用“在广义的范畴来说，道德是属于文化范围的”来证明，无产阶级必须继承地主资产阶级道德。这是徒劳的。广义地说，法权规范、法律也属于文化范畴，难道我们也要继承地主资产阶级的法律，也要继承国民党反动派的《六法全书》吗？马克思主义认为，必须打碎资产阶级国家机器。其中就包括着打碎和完全摒弃资产阶级法律。
    在上层建筑中，道德观念、规范和哲学、经济学、文学艺术是有其不同的。哲学、经济学是对社会存在的抽象反映，文学艺术是用艺术形象对社会存在的反映；而道德观念、规范和法权规范、法律一样，是人们行为规则的总和。法律、法权规范，是由国家机关制定或认可的行为规则（成文法和习惯法），并且由暴力机关强制执行的；道德则通过社会舆论来规范人们的行为。
    道德观念、规范和法律是紧密结合在一起的，这在中国封建社会里表现得特别明显。许多道德教条都直接写在法律条文上。例如，《唐律》、《明律》规定，不忠、不孝、不节都是“十恶不赦”的大罪；《汉律》、《唐律》、《明律》规定：“亲亲得相首匿”、“亲属相为容隐”，这就是说，“子为父隐”之类的道德教条也就是法律。
    尽管道德和法律是有区别的，但是，它毕竟和法律一样，是人们行为规则的总和。剥削阶级的道德和法律，都是根据剥削阶级的意志而形成的、直接压迫劳动人民的行为规则；它的职能都是直接为巩固剥削阶级的社会秩序服务的。因此，剥削阶级的道德和剥削阶级的法律一样，是根本不能继承的。
    吴晗同志除了地主资产阶级道德核心和主要规范以外，还提出了其他一些道德观念要无产阶级继承。在这里，我们择其主要的讨论一下。
    吴晗同志要我们继承孟子所说的大丈夫精神。孟子说：“行天下之大道，得志与民由之，不得志独行其道，富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈。”（《孟子·滕文公下》）吴晗同志引了这段话，要无产阶级继承，并且说，“在近、现代革命史中，也出现过符合这个标准的无数烈士和英雄人物”。
    请问：孟子所说的“道”，难道不是封建地主阶级之“道”吗？孟子所说的“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”是以地主阶级之“道”为前提的，就是说，不论是富贵的引诱，贫贱的折磨，强力的压迫，决不改变实行地主阶级之“道”的精神，这就是所谓大丈夫的品德。这里表现的是地主阶级的顽固的党性。例如，现在一个地主阶级分子说：“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈，至死要独行其道（即坚持地主阶级的立场）”，这不是十分反动的吗？这种所谓道德，怎么能有无产阶级可以继承的东西呢？
    照吴晗同志的说法，现代无产阶级革命英雄是继承了地主阶级的道德，是孟夫子思想教育的结果。这不是十分荒唐吗？我们有时候，也借用“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”，来说明无产阶级战士的革命坚定性。这里绝不是说无产阶级继承了地主阶级的道德观念，而只是从孟子那里借用了语言资料。无产阶级战士的革命坚定性绝非来源于地主资产阶级道德，而是在革命斗争中，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育下形成的。
    吴晗同志在论证必须继承封建道德的时候，还说：“诚实、勤劳、勇敢、刻苦耐劳、雄心壮志这些美德，难道不都可以移用在今天？”
    试问：有什么抽象的“诚实”、“勇敢”、“雄心壮志”吗？地主阶级道德所讲的“诚实”是忠实于地主阶级，对地主阶级诚实；无产阶级道德所讲的诚实是忠于党、忠于人民，对党、对人民老老实实，如果在敌人的法庭上也“诚实”，那是出卖党的秘密的叛徒。地主阶级道德所讲的“勇敢”是和维护地主阶级的利益联系在一起的，在封建社会里，镇压农民起义的刽子手，被地主阶级颂扬为“忠勇可嘉”、道德高尚，在无产阶级专政的今天，地主阶级分子还讲他们那个阶级的“勇敢”，这就是顽固不化，反对无产阶级专政；无产阶级道德所讲的勇敢是在反对地主资产阶级的斗争中无所畏惧，在革命战争中英勇杀敌，奋不顾身。地主阶级的“雄心壮志”是万贯家财、荣华富贵或个人野心家的争权夺利，在无产阶级专政的时代就是复辟地主资产阶级的统治；无产阶级的雄心壮志是把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国，是在中国和全世界彻底消灭剥削、消灭阶级，实现共产主义。“诚实”、“勇敢”、“雄心壮志”等等完全是具体的、阶级的。无产阶级的诚实、勇敢、雄心壮志与地主阶级的“诚实”、“勇敢”、“雄心壮志”绝然对立，怎么能把地主阶级的“诚实”、“勇敢”、“雄心壮志”“移用在今天”？
    至于“勤劳”、“刻苦耐劳”，这根本不是地主阶级的道德。
  “勤劳”、“刻苦耐劳”总是和劳动联系在一起的，它是劳动人民的美德。地主阶级是不劳而获的寄生虫，他们认为劳动是可耻的，是卑贱人做的事情，他们没有也不可能有“勤劳”、“刻苦耐劳”的品德。吴晗同志把劳动人民才可能有的“勤劳”、“刻苦耐劳”的美德挂在地主阶级的头上，这不是露骨地宣传地主靠自己“勤劳节俭”起家吗？
    吴晗同志还宣传地主阶级的“刚直不阿”，把它说成超阶级的，硬要无产阶级接受。这也是完全骗人的。超阶级的“刚直不阿”是没有的。所谓“刚直不阿”，在地主那里，从根本上说来，就是坚持维护地主阶级的整个利益的原则，而不逢迎破坏这种原则的上司；如果说到无产阶级道德时，有限制的借用“刚直不阿”这个词汇，那么它指的是坚持无产阶级革命原则。两者是极端相反的。无产阶级从革命利益出发维护自己的领导，这是应有的美德；而地主资产阶级却把这种美德骂为“阿”，骂为“逢迎拍马”。在一九五七年，资产阶级右派不是就这样恶毒地攻击过我们吗？在无产阶级专政的条件下，宣扬抽象的即故意掩盖其阶级内容的“刚直不阿”，只能是反对无产阶级、反对社会主义的东西。
    在世界上还没有从经济上、政治上、思想上彻底消灭剥削阶级及其影响以前，是不可能有什么超阶级的道德的。正如恩格斯所说：“只有在不仅消灭了阶级对立，而且甚至在实际生活中这种对立已被遗忘了的社会发展阶段上，超越阶级对立及对这种对立的回忆之上的、真正人类的道德方才成为可能。”⑤
    吴晗同志利用人们还在使用的在历史上形成的语词、语言，掩盖地主资产阶级道德的阶级性，把它说成“全民性”的东西，要人们把它接受下来。这完全是骗人的戏法。
    恩格斯在《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》一书中，论到婚姻制度时说，在人类社会发展的历史上，随着私有制的出现，形成了一夫一妻制婚姻。又说，无产阶级的婚姻也是一夫一妻制。这两种一夫一妻制是不是有什么相同的地方呢？恩格斯作了完全否定的回答。他说，在无产阶级这里，古典的一夫一妻制的全部基础，都除去了。“无产者的婚姻，决不是在一夫一妻制这个词的历史意义上，而是就这个词的语源意义上说来，是一夫一妻制的。”⑥我们认为，恩格斯在这里指出了研究历史、特别是思想史的一个重要原则。这就是必须把词的本来的意义即
  “历史意义”和“语源意义”区别开。这也就是说，语词、语言和它在不同时代、不同阶级那里所代表的意义，不是一码事。同一句语言，同一个语词，它的意义，它的社会内容，在不同时代、不同阶级那里，还往往是完全相反的。刘少奇同志在《论共产党员的修养》一书中，在谈到共产主义道德，谈到共产党员要有坚定的立场，要无条件地热爱人民、为人民服务的时候，曾经引用了范仲淹的“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”⑦。毫无疑义，刘少奇同志引用范仲淹的这句话，只是利用旧有的语言资料。范仲淹所说的“天下”，是地主阶级的天下，是地主阶级的整体利益；而刘少奇同志引用范仲淹这句话，从上下文看来，明明白白，是说明共产党员应该把无产阶级革命的利益、群众的利益摆在第一位，吃苦在前，享受在后。两者的阶级实质是完全相反的。有人用刘少奇同志引用了范仲淹的话，来论证共产党员继承了地主阶级的道德，那完全是歪曲和欺骗群众。我们要采用历史上形成的为人民群众熟悉的、今天还有用的语言资料，来丰富我们的语言，同时要坚决反对把语言资料的利用说成是继承地主资产阶级的道德。
    四、吴晗同志的道德论，是他的反社会主义
              思想的一个组成部分
    正是在地主资产阶级的复辟活动，贩卖地主资产阶级道德，特别在一九六二年当吹捧“孔子”十分猖獗的时候，吴晗同志抛出了他的《说道德》《再说道德》。在这种情况下，吴晗同志宣扬地主资产阶级道德，硬要无产阶级继承地主资产阶级道德的核心和主要规范，硬要无产阶级把家谱续到地主资产阶级那里，其政治意义不是代表复辟资本主义的逆流，反对社会主义，又是什么呢？
    很显然，吴晗同志的道德论，既是对一九五八年以来文化革命的“反动”，又是三年暂时经济困难期间，在意识形态领域内，对无产阶级的斗争。
    从中国近代革命史、特别是辛亥革命以来的革命史上可以看出，每一次封建道德的复辟活动，每一次复古尊孔运动，都是反动阶级政治复辟运动的先导，都是对前一次革命运动的反动。而当这种反动逆流受到揭露、批判之后，坏事就变成好事，促进了新的革命高潮的到来，为革命的前进作了思想上的准备。
    要战胜地主资产阶级的道德，必须大力宣扬无产阶级的新道德，宣扬革命者的高贵品质。无产阶级道德的发扬，同破除旧道德是分不开的。旧道德不破，新道德不立，旧道德不止，新道德不行，旧道德不塞，新道德不流。一句话，不坚决摒弃地主资产阶级的吃人道德，就不可能发扬无产阶级的高尚道德。另一方面，新道德的发扬和巩固，又将加速旧道德的最后死亡。
    目前在我国，共产主义道德获得了空前的发展。广大工农兵群众，在毛泽东思想的哺育之下，抗拒了形形色色的剥削阶级道德的思想毒素，树立了以一心为革命、全心全意为人民服务为核心的共产主义道德。这是扫除旧道德的基本的社会力量。
    新道德总是在同旧道德的斗争中成长起来的。无产阶级道德形成的过程，也就是同地主资产阶级的斗争过程。无产阶级道德的进一步发扬，必然伴随着同地主资产阶级道德的激烈斗争。无产阶级必将在这场斗争中，把自己的道德提高到更高的境界。
