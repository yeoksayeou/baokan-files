    Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 26th—The Central Delegation dispatched by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, led by Zeng Shan, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Minister of Internal Affairs, arrived in batches in Xingtai, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, and other areas of Hebei Province on the 23rd and 24th to express their condolences to the masses affected by the strong earthquake on the 22nd. The delegation highly praised the revolutionary spirit of the masses in the disaster areas in their tenacious struggle against natural disasters.
    The arrival of the Central Delegation in the earthquake-stricken areas greatly encouraged the masses, who surrounded them and shouted for a long time: "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" The delegation held mass meetings or symposiums in various disaster areas, conveying the cordial concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the people in the disaster areas. They also especially encouraged them to carry forward the spirit of being fearless of heaven and earth, and daring to resist any disaster; to remain calm, heighten vigilance, do a good job in disaster relief and prevention, and to be self-reliant, work hard, arrange their lives well, and quickly engage in production without delaying the farming season.
    Inspired by the delegation, the cadres and masses in the disaster areas greatly strengthened their confidence in overcoming the disaster. They told the delegation: "Please rest assured, Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of any difficulties, we can be self-reliant and rebuild our homes!" Wang Zizhou, a 68-year-old poor peasant commune member, led the commune members in singing the song "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are of One Heart" when welcoming the delegation. He said: "We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, boost our energy to engage in production, and build our homes better!" Song Shuchen, the Party branch secretary of a production brigade, said: "Disasters cannot scare us, with people, we have everything!"
    The delegation members also visited the homes of commune members and visited commune members who were injured in the earthquake. After visiting the disaster areas, the delegation members saw with their own eyes that although the earthquake on the 22nd was stronger than the earthquake on the 8th, the losses caused were much lighter. This is mainly because, under the leadership of the Party, the local masses carried forward the revolutionary spirit of resisting natural disasters, constantly heightened their vigilance, and took various preventive measures. In one production brigade, with the Party branch as the core, 27 Party members, together with members of the Communist Youth League and militiamen, had mobilized the masses before this earthquake to prepare for disaster prevention. They formulated specific measures to deal with emergencies, requiring that in the event of an earthquake, every household should have someone to take care of it, who would help the elderly out of the house, who would lead the livestock out of the shed, which route to take, and where to transfer to, all with clear regulations. The Party branch also designated special personnel to patrol and report the alarm day and night, and notify everyone in time if there was a situation. Therefore, when the first strong earthquake occurred on the afternoon of the 22nd, the masses of the entire village were transferred to a safe place in an orderly manner, completely avoiding casualties to people and livestock.
    The Central Delegation attached great importance to the experience of the people in the disaster areas in resisting earthquake disasters, highly praised their revolutionary spirit and creativity, and at the same time emphasized to local cadres and the masses that as long as they adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, give prominence to politics, fully mobilize the masses, and prepare for both possibilities, being neither afraid nor chaotic, there will be ways to deal with earthquake disasters. The delegation asked the local disaster relief personnel to summarize the experience of the masses in resisting earthquake disasters and promote it.
    Wherever the delegation members went, they saw People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters helping with disaster relief work, and some were conducting propaganda to the masses. These PLA commanders and fighters rushed to the disaster-stricken villages late at night after the strong earthquake occurred on the afternoon of the 22nd. A large number of cadres dispatched by Party and government organs at all levels also arrived at the scene one after another. Batches of cooked food, finished grain, medicines, cooking utensils, and materials for building simple houses were also being transported to the disaster areas, ensuring that the lives of the affected people were properly arranged. Medical teams from various places arrived quickly after the disaster, ensuring that the injured received timely treatment.
    This reporter saw in the disaster area that in the days after the disaster, PLA troops, disaster relief personnel, and grassroots cadres were conducting extensive propaganda work to the broad masses. The activities of Party and League organizations and militia organizations in various villages were very active. People posted many slogans on the walls to inspire fighting spirit. Production activities in villages with minor damage have not been interrupted, and some villages with more severe damage have also resumed production. Under the guidance of the idea of "being neither afraid of earthquakes nor taking them lightly," the people in the disaster areas are engaging in a tenacious struggle with full confidence. The commune members of one production brigade submitted a letter of determination to the delegation, which read: "The delegation brought us Mao Zedong Thought, brought revolutionary enthusiasm, brought courage to overcome natural disasters, and brought the deep affection of the Party and Chairman Mao. We believe that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be overwhelmed by disasters or difficulties. We will definitely be self-reliant, strive for progress, rebuild our homes, and develop production to repay the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." This letter of determination deeply expressed the common sentiment of the people in the disaster areas.

    中央慰问团在邢台、衡水、石家庄地震灾区进行慰问
    党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀极大鼓舞了灾区群众
    灾区群众决心发扬自力更生精神，奋发图强，重建家园，发展生产
    新华社石家庄二十六日电　中共中央和国务院派出的中央慰问团，在中共中央委员、内务部部长曾山率领下，已在二十三日和二十四日分批到达河北省邢台、衡水、石家庄等地区，慰问在二十二日强烈地震时受灾的群众。慰问团高度赞扬了灾区群众同自然灾害进行顽强斗争的革命精神。
    中央慰问团来到地震灾区，给灾区群众带来了极大的鼓舞，群众围着他们长久地高呼：“共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”慰问团在灾区各地召开了群众大会或座谈会，转达了党中央和毛主席对灾区群众的亲切关怀，还特别鼓励他们发扬天不怕地不怕、敢于抵抗任何灾害的硬骨头精神；鼓励他们保持镇定，提高警惕，做好救灾防灾工作，并且要自力更生，艰苦奋斗，安排好生活，不误农时地迅速投入生产。
    灾区的干部和群众受到慰问团的鼓舞，战胜灾害的信心大大加强。他们向慰问团表示：“请党中央和毛主席放心，我们不怕任何困难，我们能够自力更生，重建家园！”六十八岁的老贫农社员王子周在欢迎慰问团的时候，带领社员们激动地高唱起《贫农下中农一条心》这支歌。他说：“我们一定听毛主席的话，鼓足劲头搞生产，把家园建设得更好！”一个生产大队的党支部书记宋书辰说：“灾害吓不倒我们，有了人，就有了一切！”
    慰问团人员还分头访问了社员的家庭，探望了在地震时受伤的社员。经过在灾区访问，慰问团人员亲眼看到，尽管二十二日的地震比八日的地震强烈，但是造成的损失却要轻得多。这主要是因为当地群众在党的领导下，发扬抗御自然灾害的革命精神，随时提高警惕，采取了各种预防措施的结果。有一个生产大队，以党支部为核心，二十七名党员同共青团员和民兵一起，在这次地震以前分头发动群众做好防灾的准备工作。他们拟定了应付紧急情况的具体措施，要求做到一发生地震，每户人家都有人照应，谁扶老人出屋，谁牵牲口出棚，走哪条路线，转移到什么地方，都有明确的规定。党支部还指定专人昼夜巡逻报警，一有情况就及时通知大家。因此，在二十二日下午发生第一次强烈地震时，全村群众便秩序井然地转移到安全地点，完全避免了人畜的伤亡。
    中央慰问团十分重视灾区人民群众这些抗御地震灾害的经验，高度赞扬了他们的这种革命精神和创造性，同时向当地干部和群众强调指出，只要坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，充分发动群众，做好两手准备，既不怕，又不乱，就会有办法应付地震灾害。慰问团要求当地救灾人员，把群众创造的抗御地震灾害的经验总结起来，加以推广。
    慰问团人员所到之处，看到许多村庄都有人民解放军指战员在帮助进行救灾工作，有的在向群众进行宣传。这些解放军指战员是在二十二日下午发生强烈地震后，深夜赶赴受灾村庄的。由各级党政机关派出的大批干部也随即陆续赶到现场。成批的熟食品、成品粮、药品、炊具和修建简易房屋用的材料，也正源源运往灾区，使受灾群众的生活得到了妥善安排。各地医疗队在灾后很快赶到，使伤员得到及时治疗。
    本社记者在灾区看到，在受灾后的这几天里，解放军部队、救灾人员和基层干部，都在对广大群众进行广泛的宣传工作。各村庄的党团组织和民兵组织的活动很活跃。人们在墙壁上贴起许多激励斗志的标语。灾情较轻的村庄，生产活动一直没有中断，受灾较重的村庄有的也已恢复生产。受灾群众在“既要不怕地震，又要认真对待地震”、“有灾救灾，无灾防灾”的思想指导下，正满怀信心地进行顽强的斗争。有个生产大队的社员向慰问团递交了一封决心书，上面写道：“慰问团给我们带来了毛泽东思想，带来了革命干劲，带来了战胜自然灾害的勇气，带来了党和毛主席的深情厚意。我们相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，灾害压不倒，困难难不倒。我们一定自力更生，奋发图强，重建家园，发展生产，答谢党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀。”这封决心书深深地表达了灾区群众的共同心意。
