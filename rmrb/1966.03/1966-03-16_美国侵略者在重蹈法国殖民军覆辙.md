    American Aggressors Are Repeating the Mistakes of the French Colonial Army

    Twelve years ago, in March, when the heroic Vietnamese people launched the world-renowned Dien Bien Phu campaign, inflicting a fatal blow on the French colonial army, the American magazine *Newsweek* sent one of its main editors, Deboschgraff, to visit the Vietnamese battlefield. This March, Deboschgraff was once again sent by *Newsweek* to South Vietnam to interview the situation in South Vietnam under the rule of the South Vietnamese puppet regime and the fighting of the American aggressor troops. After returning to the United States, Deboschgraff published a report in the March 14th issue of *Newsweek* comparing the present with the past. From this report, it can be seen that the American aggressor troops are repeating the mistakes of the French colonial army and heading towards complete defeat. The following is an excerpt and annotated translation of this report:

    Twelve years later (returning to Vietnam), you will say to yourself that someone has copied an old movie script. The location hasn't changed, and the characters are almost the same. The plot, structure, and interjections are tragically familiar. The old one was a low-budget (one million dollars a day) production, while the current one is a costly (thirty-five million dollars a day) farce, where money is no object. But witnessing the shooting and hearing the dialogue, you can't help but say, "Seen it before, heard it before." (Everyone knows how the French colonialists' script ended, and the American aggressors' script will have no other ending.)

    Now, just like twelve years ago, a red-faced senior official is handing out the same dangerous oversimplifications to newly arrived reporters. He declares, "We control most of the people, and the Viet Cong controls most of the countryside" or "They control twenty-five percent of the territory, we control twenty-five percent, and the rest is contested territory." But in fact, everything—people and countryside—is being contested. The enemy can strike at our vitals at the time and place of their choosing; we can do the same to them. (The first half of the sentence is the truth, and the second half is boastful talk. The recent consecutive multi-pronged offensives launched by the American aggressors and the failure of them is proof of this.)

    In the same restaurant in Di An, the same interlocutor (now twelve years older) meticulously lists the various scandals of the American commodity import program being undermined, the licensing arrangements that benefit a few, the illegal exchange of South Vietnamese currency, the names of the wives of South Vietnamese generals and field-grade officers who run businesses in place of their husbands, and the enrichment of American civilian contractors. Twelve years ago, he was telling me stories of French merchants getting rich.

    Now, just like in the past, even in the heart of Saigon, the Viet Cong's taxation system is more effective than the government's.

    Now, just like in the past, the blue dots (representing the areas under the jurisdiction of the puppet regime—translator's note) on the map are deliberately enlarged, and the red dots (representing the liberated areas—translator's note) are shrunk to please the domestic government. (The two "twenty-five percents" mentioned by the above-mentioned senior US military official in Vietnam were obtained by this method.) Once, when the French government was facing another periodic vote of no confidence on the Indochina issue, the French commanding general in Vietnam showed me an urgent telegram from Paris: "Order, launch a conspicuous military operation with great publicity and minimal losses." This time I heard a senior American official who had just returned from Washington privately tell reporters that he was depressed by the impact of the war on the country and even the White House. He revealed, "The President doesn't know how to explain to the people when so many coffins are returned as the election approaches." (The reason why Johnson feels particularly depressed is that the more he orders the American aggressor troops in Vietnam to launch "conspicuous military operations," the more coffins are returned to the United States.)

    In this visit, just like twelve years ago, I witnessed that large-scale conventional military operations rarely achieve anything other than some exaggerated figures of enemy killed, many of whom are civilians. In a recent Marine sweep, only eighteen weapons were recovered from the bodies of three hundred and fourteen dead, and you immediately know that many of the enemy killed figures released daily by Saigon are honest non-combatants. Last month, when the United States launched the large-scale "Operation White Wing," special forces officers estimated that for every Viet Cong we killed or wounded, we would kill or wound ten civilians. (Since the American aggressors set foot on South Vietnamese soil, they have been constantly using this kind of brutal behavior, forcing the fourteen million South Vietnamese people to rise up and wage a resolute struggle against them.)

    Some observers point to the unprecedented mobility of the U.S. military to justify these large-scale operations. But, once away from their helicopters, the U.S. military's mobility is far less than that of the guerrillas. Even in the mountainous jungle, guerrillas can move ten to fifteen miles a day. I myself, depending on the terrain, can only move two to five miles a day. By four or five o'clock in the afternoon, the troops I accompanied often had to stop, dig trenches, spend the night, and replenish supplies.

    In addition to conventional tactics, there is the old American pacification program. Just as under the French in the past, these pacification programs are mostly in the blueprint stage. In theory, they look good and promising. But a few trips to the field reveal that they seem to be fantasies. Although many old hands in Vietnam say, "The situation in the Mekong Delta is improving," the fact is that U.S. troops do not have fixed operations here, and most of the area is still controlled by the Viet Cong. Once, a proud village chief was telling a television crew filming a pacification program, "This is the best village pacified in the Delta." Before he finished speaking, gunfire rang out nearby. (This is because the South Vietnamese people also have their own "pacification plan," which is to remove the American aggressors from their homeland without leaving one behind.)

### 美国侵略者在重蹈法国殖民军覆辙

    美国侵略者在重蹈法国殖民军覆辙
    十二年以前的三月，当英勇的越南人民发动举世闻名的奠边府战役给法国殖民军以致命打击的时候，美国《新闻周刊》派遣了它的一名主要编辑德博什格拉夫访问了越南战场。今年三月，德博什格拉夫又奉《新闻周刊》之命前往南越，采访南越傀儡政权统治下的南越和美国侵略军作战的情况。回国以后，德博什格拉夫在三月十四日的《新闻周刊》上发表了一篇今昔对比的报道。从这篇报道里，可以看出美国侵略军正在重蹈法国殖民军的覆辙、走向彻底的失败。现将这篇报道摘译并加批注发表如下：
    分别了十二年以后（再来越南），你会对自己说，有人抄袭了一部老的电影脚本。地点没有变，人物几乎是相同的。情节、结构、插话令人可悲地熟悉。旧的一部是低预算（每天一百万美元）的产品，而现在的一部是不惜巨资（每天三千五百万美元）的滑稽剧，没有钱的问题。但是目睹射击、耳听对话，你会情不自禁地说，“曾经见过，曾经听过”。（人们都晓得，法国殖民者的脚本是怎样收场的，美国侵略者的脚本也不会有别的结局。）
    现在，正象十二年以前一样，一位面孔红红的高级官员向新到的记者们散发同样危险的过度简单化的东西。他宣称，“我们控制大部分人民，越共控制大部分农村”或“他们控制百分之二十五的领土，我们控制百分之二十五，其余的是争夺中的领土”。但是，事实上，每一件东西——人民和乡村——都在争夺之中。敌人可以在他们选择的时间和地点对我们的要害进行打击；我们也可以对他们那样做。（前半句是实话，后半句则是大话。美国侵略者最近连续发动的多路攻势都遭到失败就是证明。）
    在堤岸同一个餐馆里，同一个谈话人（现在老了十二岁）历历如数地举出美国商品输入计划遭受破坏的种种丑闻，使少数人得到好处的许可证安排，南越货币的非法兑换，代替丈夫出面经营商业的南越将军和校级军官们的妻子的姓名，美国民用承包商的发财致富。十二年以前，他正向我讲述法国商人发财致富的故事。
    现在，正象过去一样，甚至在西贡的心脏，越共的征税制度比政府的更为有效。
    现在，正象过去一样，为了使国内政府高兴，故意把地图上的蓝点（代表伪政权辖区——译注）扩大，把红点（代表解放区——译注）缩小。（上面那个侵越美军高级官员所说的两个“百分之二十五”，就是用这种方法得出来的。）有一次，当法国政府面临又一次印度支那问题周期性不信任投票的时候，在越南的法国的指挥将军把从巴黎来的一份紧急电报给我看“命令，发动大事宣扬而损失最小的一次引人注意的作战行动”。这一次我听见，一位刚从华盛顿归来的美国高级官员私下告诉新闻记者们说，他对战争在国内甚至在白宫产生的影响感到忧郁。他吐露说，“总统不知道当选举临近的时候这么多棺材运回来，他向人民如何交代”。（约翰逊之所以特别感到忧郁的是，当他越是发布命令让侵越美军发动“引人注意的作战行动”，运回美国的棺材就越是增多。）
    在这次访问中，正象在十二年前一样，我目睹大规模常规作战行动除了一些夸大的击毙敌人的数字以外，很少有别的结果，而被击毙的人中间有许多是平民。在最近一次海军陆战队扫荡行动中，从三百一十四名死者身上只取得十八件武器，你就立刻知道西贡每天发布的击毙敌人数字中有许多是诚实的非战斗人员。上一个月，当美国发动大规模“白翼行动”的时候，特种部队军官估计，我们每杀死或杀伤一名越共就要杀死或杀伤十个平民。（美国侵略者从踏上南越土地就是不断用这种残暴行为，迫使一千四百万南越人民起来同它进行坚决的斗争。）
    有些观察家指出美国军队没有先例的机动性，来为这些大规模行动进行辩护。但是，一离开了他们的直升飞机，美国军队的机动就大大不如游击队了。甚至于在多山的丛林里游击队每天可以移动十哩到十五哩。我自己本人，依地形而定，一天只能移动二——五哩。行动到了下午四点或五点，我所伴随的部队往往就要停下来掘壕过夜并且重新取得给养。
    除了常规战术，还有与旧日相似的美国绥靖计划。正象当年在法国人手下一样，这些绥靖计划大都处于蓝图的阶段。在理论上，它们看来不错、有希望。但是，到现场去走几趟就发现它们似乎是幻想。虽然许多越南问题老手说，“在湄公河三角洲，情况好转起来了”，事实是在这里美国部队并没有固定的作战行动，大部分地区仍受越共的控制。有一次一个骄傲的村长正在向拍摄绥靖计划的电视工作队说，“这是三角洲绥靖最好的村庄”。话还没有说完，附近就响起了枪声。（这是因为南越人民也有自己的“绥靖计划”，这个计划就是要把美国侵略者一个不剩地从自己的国土清除出去。）
