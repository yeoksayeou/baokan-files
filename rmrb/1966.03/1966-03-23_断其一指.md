    Sever One Finger

    Annihilation warfare is the fundamental guiding ideology of the people's revolutionary army in combat. For the enemy, defeating ten of their companies is not as good as annihilating one. Similarly, for a person, injuring ten fingers is not as good as severing one.
    Since the American invading army marched into the South Vietnamese battlefield in force, fifteen complete battalions have been completely annihilated, including six infantry battalions and six armored battalions of the First Infantry Division, one battalion of the First Cavalry Division, one battalion of the Third Marine Division, and one battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade. This is the glorious achievement of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces accumulated through countless campaign annihilation battles. It can be seen that the guiding ideology of annihilation warfare can be implemented in mobile warfare. In guerrilla warfare, although there are tasks of sabotage and harassment, annihilation warfare can also be carried out under all favorable conditions.
    A relatively weak people's revolutionary army cannot defeat a relatively strong reactionary army in one fell swoop. To change the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, we must eat away at the enemy bit by bit. In other words, it is difficult to knock off ten of the enemy's fingers at once. In one campaign or one battle, it is possible to concentrate forces and knock off one of the enemy's fingers. Knock off one, and they have nine left; knock off two, and they have eight left. To transform a relative disadvantage into a relative advantage, we must knock them off one by one, and fight annihilation battles time and time again. The South Vietnamese people's armed forces annihilated more than 34,000 American invaders in less than a year. This is the result of accurately targeting one platoon, one company, or one battalion of the enemy and eliminating them thoroughly and cleanly, accumulating small victories into great victories.
    In annihilation warfare, the gain or loss of a city or a piece of land is not important; what is important is annihilating the enemy's effective strength. Doing so is the most effective way to strike the enemy, making them lose a little with each annihilation. The U.S. military in Vietnam currently numbers more than 200,000. Even if the Johnson government continues to increase troops, every 10,000 annihilated is 10,000 less. This is the most painful point for the U.S. imperialism, which lacks sufficient troops. Annihilation warfare demoralizes the enemy and lowers their morale. The U.S. military in Vietnam often turns pale at the mention of annihilation warfare. According to American reporters, when the U.S. soldiers in Vietnam encounter annihilation warfare and people's armed forces "swarming from all directions," they are truly terrified: some are "numbed by the shock," and others desperately cry out, "Oh, God! It's terrible." The great power of annihilation warfare is evident.
    To fight annihilation warfare, it is necessary to fight close combat, night combat, and bayonet combat, and to fight quickly and decisively. This is the specialty of the people's army. In close combat, night combat, and bayonet combat, the human factor is fully brought into play. The slogan put forward by the South Vietnamese people's armed forces, "Grab the enemy's belt and fight, grab the enemy's neck and fight," fully embodies the brave spirit of the people's army in daring to fight and daring to charge. With this spirit, we can resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate the enemy.
    The strategic thinking of imperialism and all reactionaries is opposed to the strategic thinking of the people's revolutionary army. Their forte is to rely on firepower. The United States consumes approximately 200 million bullets, 3 million shells, bombs, and grenades every month in South Vietnam. In the final analysis, it is because they rely mainly on weapons to fight wars, because the army under their command is a mercenary army that is both afraid of hardship and afraid of death, and because they are waging an unjust war against the people.
    The ideology of annihilation warfare was formed in the historical process of the revolutionary people's long-term armed struggle against imperialism and reactionaries. The heroic Vietnamese people are brilliantly using this strategic thinking in their struggle against the American aggressors, constantly achieving new victories.

    断其一指
    何江
    歼灭战，是人民革命军队作战的基本指导思想。对于敌，击溃其十个连不如歼灭其一个连。正象对于人，伤其十指不如断其一指。
    美国侵略军大举闯进南越战场以来，已被全歼十五个整营，其中第一步兵师六个步兵营、六个装甲营，第一骑兵师一个营，第三海军陆战师一个营，第一七三空降旅一个营。这是南越人民武装积无数次战役歼灭战而获得的辉煌战果。可见，在运动战中，固然可以贯彻歼灭战的指导思想；在游击战中，虽有破坏和袭扰的任务，但也同样可以在一切有利条件下进行歼灭战。
    相对弱小的人民革命军队要打败相对强大的反动军队，不能一蹴而就。为了改变敌我力量的对比，只有一口一口地把敌人吃掉。换句话说，一下子要扳掉敌人十个指头，是难以做到的。在一个战役或一次战斗中，集中力量，扳掉敌人的一个指头，是可以做到的。扳掉它一个，它就剩下九个；扳掉它两个，它就剩下八个。相对的劣势要转化为相对的优势，就是要一个一个地扳，要一次一次地打歼灭战。南越人民武装不到一年内歼灭美国侵略军三万四千多人，就是找准敌人的一个排，一个连，一个营，彻底、干净加以消灭，积小胜为大胜的结果。
    打歼灭战，不在于一城一地的得失，重要的是歼敌有生力量。这样做，对敌人的打击最有效，使敌人被歼一点少一点。侵越美军现有二十多万，即使约翰逊政府继续增兵，被歼灭一万就少一万。这是兵力不足的美帝国主义感到最痛的地方。歼灭战使敌军精神沮丧，士气低落。侵越美军对于歼灭战，往往谈虎色变。据美国记者报道，侵越美军士兵碰上歼灭战，遇上“从四面八方拥来”的人民武装，真是丧魂失魄：有的“由于震惊而神经麻木了”，有的绝望地呼叫，“啊，上帝！真可怕”。歼灭战威力之大，可见一斑。
    打歼灭战，就是要打近战、夜战、白刃战，速战速决。这是人民军队的特长。在近战、夜战和白刃战中，人的因素得到了充分的发挥。南越人民武装提出的“抓着敌人腰带打，抓着敌人脖子打”的口号，充分体现了人民军队敢打、敢冲的勇敢精神。有了这种精神，就能坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把敌人歼灭。
    帝国主义和一切反动派的战略思想，同人民革命军队的战略思想是相对立的。它们的拿手好戏是拼火力。美国在南越每个月消耗约两亿发子弹，三百万颗炮弹、炸弹和手榴弹。说到底，是因为它们打仗，主要是靠武器，是因为它们手下的军队是一支既怕苦又怕死的雇佣军，是因为它们进行的是一场反人民的不义战争。
    歼灭战的思想，是革命人民在同帝国主义和反动派进行长期武装斗争的历史进程中形成的。英勇的越南人民在反对美国侵略者的战斗中，出色地运用这一战略思想，不断地取得新的胜利。
