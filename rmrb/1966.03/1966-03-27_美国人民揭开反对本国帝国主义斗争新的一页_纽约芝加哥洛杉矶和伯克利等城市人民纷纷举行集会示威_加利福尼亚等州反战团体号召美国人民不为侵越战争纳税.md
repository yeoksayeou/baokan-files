　　New China News Agency, March 26th – A new and massive movement protesting the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam has begun across the United States on the 25th, with demonstrations expanding and expected to reach a climax on the 26th.
    United Press International described the demonstrations as "a violent eruption of activity from Massachusetts (in the northeast) to California (in the southwest)." This is another national action taken by the American people following the nationwide protests against the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam last October.
    According to the "National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam," which is responsible for organizing the demonstrations, public participation is expected in 120 U.S. cities and 40 other countries during the three-day "International Protest Day" activities. Major cities such as Washington, New York, and Chicago are planning grand demonstrations or marches on the 26th. The committee's chairman, Ames Park, said that these protests would "tell everyone that no one can stop us because we have launched a mass movement to end the war."
    On the 25th, in Berkeley, on the West Coast, the protest demonstration against the arrival of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg was the largest of the first day's protest activities. More than a thousand demonstrators marched on the University of California campus to protest against American aggression against Vietnam. The demonstrators held placards against the Johnson government's aggression and war policies. The placards read, "Yankee, Get Out of Vietnam!" and other slogans. More than seven thousand faculty members and students at the University of California besieged Goldberg, who went to the school to peddle Johnson's policy of aggression against Vietnam, and raised a series of questions to him at the meeting. Goldberg was passively parrying, his arguments were exhausted, and he was in a very embarrassed state. When a standing vote was taken at the meeting on whether to approve the government's policy of aggression against Vietnam, more than 90 percent of those present immediately stood on the opposing side. Earlier that day, when the school authorities awarded Goldberg an "Honorary Doctorate of Laws," more than 500 faculty members and students collectively walked out of the venue in protest. On the same day, nearly a thousand students held an anti-U.S. aggression against Vietnam protest rally at the Los Angeles campus of the same university.
    In New York, hundreds of demonstrators held a mass rally in downtown Manhattan protesting the aggression against Vietnam. Fifteen American veterans who had participated in World War II and the Korean War angrily burned their discharge certificates at the meeting, expressing their strong protest against the U.S. government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    In Boston, more than two hundred demonstrators held a sit-in demonstration outside a local military base on the 25th. A young man named David Benson publicly tore his draft registration card into pieces.
    On the same day, protest demonstrations of varying scales were also held in Chicago, Ann Arbor, Cambridge, and other cities.
    In order to welcome this International Protest Day, the public in some places had already begun to take action as early as the 24th. In Iowa City, Iowa, about two hundred demonstrators held a torchlight parade protesting the aggression against Vietnam on the evening of the 24th. In New York, fifty college students began a fifty-six-hour hunger strike on this day to protest the government's war of aggression against Vietnam; three New York youths also publicly burned their draft cards on this day, two of whom had already been jailed for five months and one year respectively for refusing to serve in the military.
    In addition, anti-war groups in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and other states issued calls demanding that the American people not pay taxes for the war of aggression against Vietnam. A special committee composed of medical students in New York City has requested an investigation into the crimes of the United States in carrying out chemical warfare in Vietnam; they also called on medical students across the country to organize similar institutions.
    The Johnson government suppressed the American public participating in the protests, and many demonstrators were arrested by the police in various places on charges of so-called "inciting riots, obstructing traffic, and causing trouble."

    美国人民揭开反对本国帝国主义斗争新的一页
    纽约芝加哥洛杉矶和伯克利等城市人民纷纷举行集会示威
    加利福尼亚等州反战团体号召美国人民不为侵越战争纳税
　  新华社二十六日讯　一次新的声势浩大的抗议约翰逊政府侵越战争的运动，已经于二十五日在美国各地开始，示威活动正在扩大，二十六日将达到高潮。
    合众国际社把这次示威活动形容为“从（东北部的）马萨诸塞州到（西南部的）加利福尼亚州的猛烈爆发的活动”。这是继去年十月美国人民对约翰逊政府侵越政策发动全国性抗议之后，又一次采取的全国性行动。
    据负责组织这次示威活动的“结束越南战争全国协调委员会”宣布，在这次历时三天的“国际抗议日”活动中，预计将有一百二十个美国城市和四十个其他国家的公众参加。华盛顿、纽约和芝加哥等重要城市都计划在二十六日举行盛大的示威或进军。这个委员会的主席埃姆斯帕克说，这些抗议活动将“告诉每一个人，由于我们发动了争取结束战争的群众运动，任何人都无法阻拦我们”。
    二十五日，在西海岸的伯克利市，针对美国驻联合国大使戈德堡的到来而举行的抗议示威是第一天抗议活动中规模最大的。一千多名示威者向加利福尼亚大学校园举行抗议进军，反对美国侵略越南。示威群众举着反对约翰逊政府的侵略和战争政策的标语牌。标语牌上写着“美国滚出越南！”等口号。加利福尼亚大学的七千多名师生对前往该校兜售约翰逊侵越政策的戈德堡发动了围攻，在大会上向他提出了一连串的质问，戈德堡被动招架，理屈辞穷，狼狈不堪。会上就是否赞成政府侵越政策进行起立表决时，百分之九十以上的到会者立即站到了反对的一边。在这一天的早些时候，当学校当局授予戈德堡“名誉法学博士学位”时，当场有五百多名师生集体退出会场，表示抗议。同一天，在这个大学的洛杉矶校部，也有近千名学生举行了反对美国侵略越南的抗议大会。
    在纽约，数百名示威者在曼哈顿闹市区举行了抗议侵略越南的群众大会。十五名参加过第二次世界大战和侵朝战争的美国退伍军人，在会上愤怒地烧掉了他们的退伍证书，表示对美国政府侵越政策的强烈抗议。
    在波士顿，两百多名示威者二十五日在当地的一处军事基地外面举行了静坐示威。一个名叫戴维·本森的青年当众把他的兵役登记证撕成碎片。
    同一天，在芝加哥、安阿伯、坎布里奇等城市也举行了规模不等的抗议示威。
    为了迎接这次国际抗议日，一些地方的公众早在二十四日就已经开始采取行动。在衣阿华州的衣阿华市，大约两百名示威者在二十四日晚上举行了抗议侵略越南的火炬游行。在纽约，有五十名大学生在这一天开始了五十六小时的绝食斗争，抗议政府的侵越战争；三名纽约青年还在这一天当众焚毁了征兵证，他们中间有两个人由于拒服兵役已经分别坐过五个月和一年的牢。
    另外，加利福尼亚、俄勒岗、华盛顿、亚利桑那等州的反战团体发出号召，要求美国人民不要为侵越战争纳税。纽约市一批医学院学生组成了一个特别委员会，要求调查美国在越南进行化学战的罪行；他们还号召全国各地的医学院学生也组织同样的机构。
    约翰逊政府对参加抗议活动的美国公众进行镇压，在各地有许多示威者被警察以所谓
  “煽动骚乱、阻碍交通和惹事生非”的罪名逮捕。
