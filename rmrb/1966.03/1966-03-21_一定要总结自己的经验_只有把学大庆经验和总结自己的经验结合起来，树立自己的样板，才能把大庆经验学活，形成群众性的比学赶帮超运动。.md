    Be Sure to Summarize Your Own Experiences
    Only by combining the study of Daqing's experience with the summarization of one's own experiences and establishing one's own model can Daqing's experience be truly learned and a mass movement of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced be formed.
    In studying Daqing's experience, we deeply realize that studying the advanced experiences of fraternal units must be combined with summarizing our own experiences and establishing our own model. Only in this way can we learn actively and learn well.
    Before studying Daqing, we did not pay enough attention to this point. We lacked sensitivity to the advanced things around us. Many advanced models among the masses were not carefully cultivated and summarized. Some good experiences, although discovered, were not elevated high enough, promoted widely enough, and not adhered to. This is a profound lesson from our past work.
    Daqing's experience has greatly inspired us on this point. We began to realize that to learn from Daqing well, we must grasp this point. Therefore, in the past two years, leading cadres at all levels of our factory have personally taken charge and gone deep to cultivate and summarize our own models. Our factory's body shop has a wheel production line. The workers have persisted in carrying out technical revolution for eight years, designing and manufacturing themselves, and carrying out more than sixty innovations on this line. Every machine tool and every process has been innovated, liberating the workers from the heavy physical labor of moving fifteen tons of parts every day, realizing mechanization and automation, and greatly changing the face of wheel production. The batch output has increased from fifty-three vehicle sets to one hundred and twenty vehicle sets. After the leading cadres went deep to stay at selected points, "treasures" like these that had been buried in the grassroots for a long time were unearthed one by one. In addition, the leading cadres, together with the grassroots cadres, summarized some of their own Daqing-style experiences, such as the engine factory's experience in conducting family work and strengthening ideological and political work in collective dormitories, the heat treatment workshop's experience in the electrical welding group doing the work of backward people and transforming backward groups, and the chassis factory's experience in vigorously carrying out "three transformations," etc. In the past two years, we have summarized and established our own models in a relatively concentrated manner four times, so that we have our own experiences and models in various periods and aspects, which has powerfully promoted the movement of learning from Daqing and learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced.
    Practice has proved that only by combining the study of Daqing's experience with the summarization of one's own experiences and establishing one's own model can Daqing's experience be truly learned concretely and form a mass movement.
    The activity of focusing on five-good equipment and vigorously carrying out civilized production, which was widely carried out in our factory not long ago, is a good illustration. We have also carried out civilized production in the past, but we have not persisted well. In the third quarter of last year, we heard that the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company was doing well in civilized production, so we called on the whole factory to learn from Ma'anshan Iron and Steel and carry out civilized production. The call was made, but the action was not fast, the momentum was not great, and the results were not significant. Not long after, the chassis factory of our factory put forward the slogan of "three transformations." They wanted to strive for a relatively significant change in the spiritual state of the workers, production technology, and civilized production in a not long period of time. After the Party committee discovered this trend, the leading comrades personally took charge, went deep to summarize their experience, and at an appropriate time, held an on-site meeting to promote it. This immediately stimulated the civilized production activities of the whole factory. After the on-site meeting, many people went to the chassis factory every day to visit and study, and quickly formed a upsurge of "learning from the chassis, catching up with the chassis, and surpassing the chassis." This situation has also promoted the chassis factory. They felt that "the situation is pressing people" and they must continue to move forward. Some people were originally worried that "like in the past, the rabbit's tail will not be long." Now they are determined to put forward measures to consolidate and improve, so that the "three transformations" activities will continue and gradually improve.
    Now, our factory is further setting off a wave of learning from Daqing. In the past two years, although we have done some work in learning from Daqing, it is still far from enough, and we have not learned many things. The gap between us and Daqing is still very large, and Daqing is moving forward quickly. In the future, we must earnestly combine learning from Daqing's experience with earnestly summarizing and promoting our own experience, and strive to make better achievements.

    一定要总结自己的经验
    只有把学大庆经验和总结自己的经验结合起来，树立自己的样板，才能把大庆经验学活，形成群众性的比学赶帮超运动。
    在学习大庆经验中，我们深刻体会到，学习兄弟单位的先进经验，一定要与总结自己的经验相结合，树立自己的样板，只有这样才能学得活，学得好。
    学大庆以前，我们对这一点注意很不够，对自己周围的先进事物缺乏敏感，群众中的许多先进典型，没有认真培养和总结；有些好的经验，虽然被发现了，但是树得不高，推得不广，没有坚持下来。这是我们过去工作中的一条深刻教训。
    大庆经验在这一点上给了我们很大启发，我们开始认识到，要学好大庆必须抓住这一条。因此近两年来，我厂的各级领导干部亲自挂帅，深入下去，培养、总结自己的样板。我们厂所属的车身厂有一条车轮生产线，职工们坚持八年大闹技术革命，自己设计、自己制造，在这条线上搞了六十多项革新，台台机床、道道工序都有革新，把工人从每天需要搬运十五吨零件的繁重体力劳动中解放出来，实现了机械化、自动化，大大改变了车轮生产面貌，班产量由五十三辆份提高到一百二十辆份。领导干部深入下去蹲点以后，类似这些长期埋藏在基层中的“宝贝”，被我们一一发掘出来了。另外，领导干部深入下去联系蹲点，还和基层干部一起，总结出了一些自己的大庆式经验，如发动机厂进行家属工作的经验和加强集体宿舍思想政治工作的经验，热处理车间电气焊小组做后进人、改造落后小组等工作的经验，底盘厂大搞“三变样”的经验等。两年来，我们先后四次比较集中的总结、树立了自己的样板，使各个时期、各个方面都有了自己的经验和自己的样板，这就有力地推进了学大庆的比学赶帮超运动。
    实践证明，只有把学大庆经验和总结自己的经验结合起来，树立自己的样板，才能把大庆经验学活、学具体，形成群众性的活动。
    不久前，我厂普遍开展的以五好设备为中心、大搞文明生产的活动，就是一个很好的说明。文明生产过去我们也搞过，但没有很好坚持下来。去年第三季度，我们听到马鞍山钢铁公司文明生产好，就号召全厂学马钢，搞文明生产。号召是提出来了，可是行动不快，声势不大，成绩不显著。不久以后，我厂的底盘厂提出了“三变样”的口号，他们要在一个不长的时间内，争取在职工的精神状态、生产技术、文明生产三方面有一个比较显著的改变。党委发现这个苗头以后，领导同志亲自挂帅，深入下去，总结了他们的经验，并在适当时机，召开现场会，加以推广。这样一下就把全厂文明生产活动带动起来了。现场会后，每天都有许多人去底盘厂参观、学习，很快形成了一个“学底盘、赶底盘、超底盘”的热潮。这种形势又促进了底盘厂，他们感到“形势逼人”，非不断前进不行。原来有一些人还担心“和过去一样，兔子尾巴长不了”。现在他们下决心，提出巩固提高的措施，使“三变样”活动坚持下去，逐步提高。
    现在，我们厂正在进一步掀起学大庆的热潮。两年多来，我们虽然在学大庆方面做了一些工作，但还很不够，很多东西我们还没有学到手。我们和大庆的差距还很大，大庆又在很快前进。今后，我们要认真学习大庆的经验同认真总结推广自己的经验结合起来，争取作出更好的成绩。第一汽车制造厂党委副书记  王黎山
