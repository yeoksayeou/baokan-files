    To Serve Farmers Well, We Must Study Their Needs
    Designers from Fourteen Fountain Pen Factories Nationwide, Establishing a Mindset of Serving Farmers, Conduct In-depth Rural Research, and Design Fifty New Fountain Pen Varieties in Half a Year, Welcomed by Farmers

    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd) Recently, many brightly colored, novel in style, and high-quality ordinary iridium pens have appeared in stationery stores in small and medium-sized towns. These new pens, produced for the vast number of farmers, are new products carefully designed by fourteen fountain pen factories nationwide. But it is also these new pens that reflect a revolution in product design thinking that factories in various regions have experienced in recent months.

    This product design revolution began at a symposium half a year ago. At that time, the Ministry of Light Industry, based on feedback from farmers in various regions, decided to convene a design symposium in Shanghai focused on ordinary iridium pens for rural areas. The notice also told pen factories in various regions that the designers attending the symposium should bring some of the ordinary iridium pens that are currently being mass-produced, so that they could exchange experiences with each other. However, before the symposium even began, a "strange thing" happened: when the pens brought by designers from various regions were opened box by box, they were all, without exception, the kind of iridium pens with thick barrels, old styles, and black ink colors. The pen nibs of these pens were all exposed nibs, the ink absorption was uniformly a push-button spring type, and the pen clips all had a round bead at the top. In the countryside, this kind of pen has been an old product that has been sold for decades, and some people have habitually abbreviated it as "Big Old Black."

    Why do factories in various regions all make products of the same specifications? Do farmers only want this kind of "Big Old Black"? At the beginning of the design symposium, there were different opinions. Some designers believed that although this pen was old-fashioned, farmers liked it; pens used in rural areas only need to be practical, there is no need to spend too much effort, and farmers may not welcome newly designed pens. Other designers did not see it that way. They believed that pens used by farmers should be practical, but there cannot be only one specification. If we can truly design some inexpensive and high-quality iridium pens, farmers will still like them.

    The opinions of designers from various regions were very inconsistent. The person in charge of this symposium from the Ministry of Light Industry decided to let everyone go to the countryside to directly listen to the farmers' feedback. Before leaving, they hastily designed some new specifications of iridium pens.

    Designers from fourteen factories came to Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, by boat and bus, and visited two production teams of a people's commune, a county-run middle school, and a commune-run primary school, and finally visited a wholesale department in the county that sells cultural goods. Here, everyone personally heard various different opinions. Some older commune members did indeed have a deep impression of the "Big Old Black" and liked to use it. They said that the barrel of this pen is thick, not only strong, but also easy to hold; the pen is black, so it is easy to find if it falls in the field. The commune members suggested that factories can make more of this kind of pen in the future. However, some primary and middle school students disliked its thick barrel and old-fashioned style, and hoped that pens with thinner barrels and better-looking colors could be made. Everyone was very interested in the batch of newly designed iridium pens that the designers brought.

    This survey visit gave the designers attending the symposium a profound education. Everyone further realized that in order to serve farmers well, they must carefully study the needs of farmers. In order to design different iridium pens according to the different needs of farmers, designers must establish a mindset of serving the people and serving the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    After the symposium, the designers from the fourteen pen factories returned to their respective regions and immediately took action. Some factories further visited nearby rural areas, collected more feedback from local farmers, and then seriously designed new pens for farmers based on various opinions. In the past six months, these pen factories have designed a total of fifty new varieties. Most of the new varieties have been put into mass production after trial sales in rural areas. Many of these new pens have adopted the advanced flower basket ink-absorption structure, and also retained the advantages of the "Big Old Black" such as the exposed nib. The colors have also been increased in many ways, which have been welcomed by the vast number of farmers.

    Some time ago, the Ministry of Light Industry held the 1965 National Fountain Pen Professional Conference in Chongqing. The materials provided by the meeting show that the quality and variety of ordinary iridium pens currently being mass-produced nationwide have greatly improved compared with 1964.

    要为农民服务得好　就要研究农民需要
    全国十四个自来水笔厂设计人员，树立为农民服务的思想，深入农村调查研究，半年来设计出五十个钢笔新品种，受到广大农民欢迎
    据新华社上海二十二日电在各地中小城镇的文具商店里，最近出现了许多颜色鲜艳、式样新颖、质量很好的普通铱金笔。这些为广大农民生产的新笔，是全国十四家自来水笔厂精心设计出来的新产品。但也就是这些新笔，反映了各地工厂在近几个月内所经历的一场产品设计思想的革命。
    这场产品设计革命，是在半年前的一次座谈会上开始的。那时，第一轻工业部根据各地农民的反映，决定在上海召集一个普通铱金笔面向农村的设计座谈会。通知上还告诉各地笔厂，前来参加座谈的设计人员，要随身带来一些目前正在大量生产的普通铱金笔，以便相互交流经验。可是，座谈会还没有召开，就出现了一件“怪事”：各地设计人员带来的笔，一盒盒打开来一看，不约而同的都是那种笔杆粗大、式样很老、颜色墨黑的铱金笔。这种笔的笔尖全是明尖，吸水一律是揿头弹簧式的，笔夹头上也都有一颗圆粒。在农村，这种笔是已经销了几十年的老产品，有些人也都习惯地把它简称为“大老黑”。
    为什么各地工厂都做这同一规格的产品？难道农民就只要这种“大老黑”？在设计座谈会一开始，就有不同的看法。有些设计人员认为，这种笔虽然老式，但农民喜欢；农村用的笔，只要实用，不必去多花什么力气，设计了新式笔，农民也不一定欢迎。另外一些设计人员却不这样看。他们认为，农民用的笔要讲究实用，但也不能只有一种规格。如果真正能够设计出一些价廉而又物美的铱金笔，农民还是会喜欢的。
    各地设计人员的意见很不一致。第一轻工业部主持这次座谈会的负责人决定让大家到农村去，直接听听农民的反映。临行以前，他们突击设计了一些新规格的铱金笔。
    十四个厂的设计人员坐船搭车来到了浙江省余姚县，先后访问了一个人民公社的两个生产队、一所县办中学和一所社办小学，最后还访问了县里一个经营文化用品的批发部。在这里，大家亲自听到了各种不同的意见。有些年纪大一点的社员，确实对“大老黑”印象很深，喜欢用它。他们说，这种笔的笔杆粗大，不但牢，而且抓得住；笔是黑的，掉在田里，也好找。社员们建议工厂以后可以多做些这种笔。但是一些中小学生却都嫌它笔杆粗，式样太老，希望做些笔杆细一些的、颜色好看一些的笔。大家对设计人员们带去的那批新设计的铱金笔，都很有兴趣。
    这次调查访问使参加座谈会的设计人员受到了一次深刻的教育。大家进一步认识到，要为农民服务得好，就必须好好研究农民的需要。要想根据农民的不同需要设计出不同的铱金笔，设计人员就必须树立为人民服务，为广大贫下中农服务的思想。
    座谈会结束后，十四家笔厂设计人员回到各地，立即行动起来。有的厂又进一步访问了附近的农村，从当地的农民那里收集更多的反映，然后根据各方面的意见，认真为农民设计新笔。这半年来，这些笔厂一共设计了五十个新品种，大部分新品种经过在农村试销，现在已投入大量生产。这许多新笔，很多都采用了先进的花篮式的吸水结构，又保持了“大老黑”的明尖等优点，颜色也增加了许多种，受到了广大农民的欢迎。
    前些时候，第一轻工业部在重庆举行了一九六五年全国自来水笔专业会议。会议提供的材料表明，全国目前正在大量生产的普通铱金笔，质量和品种比一九六四年都大有进步。
