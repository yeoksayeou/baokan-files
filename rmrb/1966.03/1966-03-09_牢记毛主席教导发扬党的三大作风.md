    We have read Chairman Mao's books, but we have not put in as much effort in the application as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, and we have not become leaders in promoting the Party's three great styles of work like him.
    Firmly Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings and Promote the Party's Three Great Styles of Work
    Yixing County is a land of fish and rice, known as "Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below," a beautiful place by Taihu Lake. In recent years, relying on our superior conditions and the support of the state, we have had continuous good harvests for four years. However, from the perspective of the Party and the people's demands on us, the changes are not satisfactory. The fundamental reason is that we have read Chairman Mao's books, but we have not put in as much effort in the application as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, and we have not become leaders in inheriting and promoting the Party's three great styles of work like Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    The integration of theory and practice is one of the Party's three great styles of work. Comrade Mao Zedong has always opposed the subjective style of separating theory from practice. He emphasized: "No investigation, no right to speak." Comrade Jiao Yulu kept this teaching in mind. In more than a year in Lankao, he braved wind and rain and traveled to nearly 90 percent of the production brigades in the county, conducting extensive investigations and research, and finally helped the county Party committee grasp first-hand information for eradicating the "three pests" in Lankao. As for me, I have been in Yixing for more than four years. Leaving aside other things, I have not conducted in-depth investigations into how to afforest the 300,000 mu of barren mountains in Yixing like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Some people say that bamboo does not grow on certain mountains, trees do not survive on certain mountains, and only grass grows on certain mountains. I can only parrot what others say, without being able to offer scientific evidence, so I cannot make a determination to change it. As a result, year after year, large areas of afforestable barren mountains remain unchanged. It was not until the provincial forestry survey team came last year that they helped us understand the situation of the barren mountains and prompted us to make a determination to formulate a plan for transforming the barren mountains. Last winter and this spring, we have planted more than 50,000 mu of bamboo, trees, tea, and fruit trees. Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "Eating leftovers has no taste." But we always eat leftovers. The mountain management survey is one example.
    The style of maintaining close contact with the masses is also a fine tradition of our Party. The reason why our Party has been able to gain the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people in the process of the Chinese revolution and construction is inseparable from the power generated by this good style of work. In his work in Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu often lived in the thatched huts of old poor peasants, squatted in cowsheds, and ate and worked with the masses. In the disaster year, when heavy snow blocked the doors of the masses, he personally visited poor families and asked about their difficulties, and called himself the son of the old poor peasants. This style of maintaining close contact with the masses has had a profound education on me. It is precisely because Comrade Jiao Yulu inherited this good style of the Party that he quickly united the 360,000 people of the county and gathered them into a huge force to eradicate the "three pests." Last autumn, Yixing was hit by a typhoon, and the houses of some of the masses were destroyed by floods. Although the county Party committee instructed the lower levels to care about the people's lives, we did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, personally wade through water and streams to visit poor families and ask about their difficulties and help solve problems. The houses of some poor and lower-middle peasants were not repaired in time, which directly affected the production and lives of the masses, and they therefore had many opinions about our leading organs. From this, it can be seen how big the gap is between us and Jiao Yulu in caring for the masses, contacting the masses, and serving the people. Why can't we care for the masses and maintain close contact with the masses like Jiao Yulu? The fundamental reason is that we have forgotten the Party's fine traditions, lack Jiao Yulu's strong Party spirit, and lack Jiao Yulu's strong class feelings.
    The disasters in Lankao are historical. It can be said that Comrade Jiao Yulu dedicated everything to the Party and to the people in Lankao. But at the time of his death, he still used a self-critical tone to say to the higher-level Party committee: "I have not completed the task assigned to me by the Party." This is such a precious spirit. As for me, I have long had a sense of complacency. I have always thought that my work has been diligent and conscientious, and that I have not been half-hearted towards the Party and the people, and that I can get by. Therefore, I do not strictly demand myself, and I rarely engage in regular self-criticism. I have relaxed the transformation of my subjective world, which has greatly affected the promotion of the transformation of the objective world.
    We are determined to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, resolutely reject "official" air, arrogance, and squeamishness, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and integrate the Party's style of combining theory with practice, the style of maintaining close contact with the masses, and the style of self-criticism into our words and deeds. We will conscientiously do a good job as the "squad leader" and promote the revolutionization of the county Party committee's leadership.
      Xu Jieqing, Secretary of the Yixing County Party Committee, Jiangsu

### 牢记毛主席教导发扬党的三大作风

    我们读了毛主席的书，没有象焦裕禄同志那样在“用”字上狠下功夫，没有象他那样当好发扬党的三大作风的带头人
    牢记毛主席教导发扬党的三大作风
    宜兴县是素称“上有天堂，下有苏杭”的鱼米之乡，是太湖之滨一个好山好水中的好地方。近几年来我们靠着自己的优越条件和国家的支援，连续四年丰收了，但从党和人民对我们的要求来看，变化不是令人满意的。根本原因是我们读了毛主席的书，没有象焦裕禄同志那样在“用”字上狠下功夫，没有象焦裕禄同志那样，当好继承和发扬党的三大优良作风的带头人。
    理论和实践相结合，是我们党的三大优良作风之一。毛泽东同志一贯反对理论脱离实践的主观主义作风，他强调指明：“没有调查就没有发言权”。焦裕禄同志记着这个教导，在兰考一年多里，就冒着风雨，跑遍全县近百分之九十的大队，作了面广量大的调查研究，终于帮助县委抓到了根治兰考“三害”的第一手资料。而我呢，到宜兴已经四年多了，不说别的，对宜兴的三十万亩荒山如何绿化，就没有象焦裕禄同志那样深入实际作调查。有人说，什么山栽竹不长，什么山栽树不活，什么山只会长草，我只能人云亦云，提不出科学的依据，所以要改变它也下不了决心。结果一年拖一年，大片宜林荒山还是没有变样。直到去年省里派来了林业调查队，才帮助我们摸清了荒山的情况，促使我们下决心制订了改造荒山的计划。去冬今春已栽竹、树、茶、果树五万多亩。焦裕禄同志说，“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”。可是我们就老是吃别人嚼过的馍。治山调查就是一例。
    和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风，也是我党的一个优良传统。我们党在中国革命和建设的过程中，所以能够得到全中国人民的热烈拥护，同这个好作风所产生的力量是分不开的。焦裕禄同志在兰考工作中，经常住老贫农的草庵子，蹲在牛棚里，和群众一起吃饭，一起劳动；灾年，大雪封住了群众的门，他亲自上门访贫问苦，并且把自己称作是老贫农的儿子。这种密切联系群众的作风，对我的教育是极为深刻的。正是由于焦裕禄同志继承了党的这种好作风，所以他很快就把全县三十六万人民紧紧地团结在一起，汇成了根除“三害”的巨大力量。去年秋天宜兴遭到台风袭击，有一部分群众的房子被洪水冲毁了。县委当时虽然也布置下面要关心群众生活，但我们没有象焦裕禄同志那样，亲自涉水过涧，访贫问苦，帮助解决问题。一部分贫下中农的房子倒了没及时修复起来，直接影响了群众的生产和生活，他们因此对我们领导机关有不少意见。由此可见，我们在关心群众，联系群众，为人民服务方面同焦裕禄相比，有多么大的差距。为什么我们不能象焦裕禄那样关心群众，和群众紧密联系在一起？根本原因是我们忘记了党的优良传统，缺乏焦裕禄那种坚强的党性，缺乏焦裕禄那种强烈的阶级感情。
    兰考的灾害是历史性的。焦裕禄同志在兰考，可说是把自己的一切献给了党，献给了人民。可是他临终时还用自我批评的口气对上级党说：“我没有完成党交给我的任务。”这是何等可贵的精神。而我呢，长期以来总存在着自满情绪，自以为一贯工作还是勤勤恳恳的，对党对人民没有三心二意，是可以过得去的。因此不严格要求自己，经常的自我批评也较少，放松了对自己主观世界的改造，从而对推动客观世界的改造，也大大受到了影响。
    我们决心以焦裕禄同志为榜样，狠狠反掉“官”气、骄气和娇气，活学活用毛主席著作，把党的理论与实践相结合的作风、和人民群众紧密联系在一起的作风、自我批评的作风，贯穿在自己的一言一行之中。认真当好“班长”，推动县委领导革命化。
