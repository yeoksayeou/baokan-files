    Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement on US Aircraft Again Wantonly Bombing the Residence of Our Delegation in Laos
    Strongly Protest the Barbaric Crimes of US Imperialism and Its Followers
    Xinhua News Agency, March 25th. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on March 25th regarding the US aircraft bombing the city of Khang Khay in Laos and the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation in Laos once again, strongly protesting this barbaric crime of US imperialism and its followers. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
             March 25, 1966

    On the morning of March 24th, four US jet aircraft once again carried out indiscriminate bombing of Khang Khay City in Laos and the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation in Laos. The residence of the Chinese delegation was destroyed by bombing, and the material property suffered significant losses. This is a provocative act carried out by US imperialism and the Laotian reactionaries in collusion. The Chinese people express extreme indignation at this serious provocative incident.

    In the process of expanding the Indochina war, US imperialism has repeatedly targeted the Chinese diplomatic institutions in Laos as targets of its attacks. The Chinese government has issued warnings about this on many occasions, but US imperialism and its followers not only turned a deaf ear but instead carried out even more frenzied bombing of the Chinese diplomatic institutions in Laos. This is an intentional provocation against the Chinese people, and this debt must be settled. The Chinese government strongly protests the barbaric crimes of US imperialism and its followers and solemnly points out that US imperialism and its followers must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    我外交部就美机又滥炸我驻老挝代表团住所发表声明
    强烈抗议美帝及其追随者野蛮罪行
    新华社二十五日讯　中国外交部二十五日就美国飞机再次轰炸老挝康开市和中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义及其追随者的这一野蛮罪行。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
              一九六六年三月二十五日
    三月二十四日上午，美国喷气式飞机四架，再一次对老挝康开市和中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地进行狂轰滥炸。中国代表团的住所被炸毁，物资财产遭到重大损失。这是美帝国主义和老挝反动派相互勾结干出来的挑衅行为。中国人民对于这一严重挑衅事件表示极大的愤慨。
    美帝国主义在扩大印度支那战争的过程中，一再把中国驻老挝的外交机构当作它攻击的目标。中国政府曾经对此多次提出警告，但是美帝国主义和它的追随者不仅置若罔闻，反而对中国驻老挝外交机构进行了更加疯狂的轰炸。这是对中国人民的有意寻衅，这笔账是一定要算的。中国政府强烈抗议美帝国主义及其追随者的野蛮罪行，并且郑重指出，美帝国主义及其追随者必须对由此而产生的一切后果承担全部责任。
