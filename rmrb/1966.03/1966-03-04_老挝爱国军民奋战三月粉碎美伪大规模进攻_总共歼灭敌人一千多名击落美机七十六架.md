　　Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd – According to a Pathet Lao radio broadcast: After three months of valiant fighting, the patriotic army and people of Laos' Xieng Khouang province have crushed a continuous large-scale offensive by the US imperialists and their Vientiane running dog puppet 13th Mobile Regiment and Kong Le's troops, consisting of over ten battalions, against Phou Kout Mountain and other liberated areas of Xieng Khouang province. In the fighting, the patriotic army and people annihilated over a thousand enemies and shot down seventy-six US aircraft.
　　The radio station said that in the past three months, while launching offensives against Upper Laos, Central Laos, and Lower Laos, the US imperialists and their running dog troops also continuously launched large-scale offensives, using land and air forces, against the Xieng Khouang-Plain of Jars area, especially the important strategic area of the Plain of Jars - the Phou Kout Mountain area. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the truly neutral armed forces guarding the Phou Kout Mountain area, as well as the local guerrillas and people, with a high degree of patriotism and a deep hatred for the enemy, launched valiant counterattacks against each enemy offensive. The radio station said that in fighting the enemy, the patriotic army and people displayed courage and tenacity. Some soldiers were buried by the mud stirred up by the enemy's bombs, but as soon as their comrades rescued them, they immediately threw themselves back into battle; some soldiers were seriously wounded but refused to leave the front line. In addition to fighting bravely alongside the main forces, local militia and guerrillas, along with the people, also undertook support work, ensuring the needs of the front line.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd – According to a Pathet Lao radio broadcast on the 2nd: Khamtay Siphandone, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, wrote a letter on February 26 to the patriotic armed forces of Xieng Khouang province, praising them for the brilliant victories they had achieved in crushing the offensive by the US imperialists and their running dog troops against the liberated areas of Xieng Khouang province.
　　The letter pointed out that the victory of the patriotic army and people of Xieng Khouang province is a support for the soldiers and civilians in other liberated areas of Laos who are fighting back against the US imperialists and their running dog troops.
　　The letter called on the patriotic army and people of Xieng Khouang province to make persistent efforts, strive for greater victories, and inflict even heavier blows on the enemy.

    老挝爱国军民奋战三月粉碎美伪大规模进攻
    总共歼灭敌人一千多名击落美机七十六架
    新华社康开二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝川圹省爱国军民在经过三个月的英勇战斗以后，粉碎了美帝国主义及其万象走狗伪第十三机动团和贡勒军队的十个多营对富科特山和其他川圹省解放区连续发动的大规模进攻。在作战中，爱国军民共歼灭敌人一千多名，击落美国飞机七十六架。
    电台说，最近三个月来，美帝国主义及其走狗军队在对老挝上寮、中寮和下寮发动进攻的同时，还用陆军和空军对川圹查尔平原地区，特别是查尔平原的重要战略地带——富科特山地区接连发动大规模进攻，守卫富科特山地区的人民解放军和真正中立武装力量部队的指战员以及当地游击队和人民怀着高度的爱国精神和对敌人的刻骨仇恨，对敌人的各次进攻展开了英勇的反击。电台说，在同敌人作战中，爱国军民表现得英勇顽强，有些战士被敌人的炸弹掀起的泥土埋住了，但当战友们把他们抢救出来以后，又立即投入战斗；有的战士负了重伤不肯下火线。各地民兵游击队除同主力部队一起英勇杀敌外，还同人民一起担负起支前工作，保证了前线的需要。
    新华社康开二日电　据巴特寮电台二日广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表坎代·西番顿二月二十六日写信给川圹省爱国武装力量，表扬他们在粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗军队对川圹省解放区的进攻中所取得的辉煌战果。
    信件指出，川圹省爱国军民的这一胜利是对正在反击美帝国主义及其走狗军队的老挝其他解放区军民的一个支持。
    信件号召川圹省爱国军民再接再厉，争取更大的胜利，给予敌人更加沉重的打击。
