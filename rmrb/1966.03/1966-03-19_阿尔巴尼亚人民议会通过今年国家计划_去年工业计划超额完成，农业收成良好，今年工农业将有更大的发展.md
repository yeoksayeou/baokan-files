    蒂奥多西在报告中指出，一九六五年工业计划完成了百分之一百零一点五，工业总产值比一九六四年增长百分之六点五。
    他说，尽管在一九六五年遇到了旱灾，但是，农业仍然获得了良好的收成。一九六五年的农业总产值高于第三个五年计划（一九六一至一九六五年）的年度平均数，其中粮食高百分之五，棉花——百分之十三，烟草——百分之十一。在一九六五年期间开垦的新地比一九六四年增加百分之二十九。蒂奥多西还谈到了其他方面的成就。
    蒂奥多西在谈到一九六六年国家计划草案时指出，一九六六年的工业总产值预计比一九六五年增长百分之九，农业总产值预计比一九六五年增长百分之十五，其中粮食生产增加百分之二十五。

    一九六六年国家预算收入为三十五亿八千万里克，比一九六五年增加百分之二点七；支出为三十五亿二千万里克，比一九六五年增加百分之六点八。一九六六年的国民收入比一九六五年将增加百分之十。他指出，一九六六年用于发展国民经济的支出为二十二亿五千万里克，占预算支出的百分之六十三点九，比一九六五年增加百分之十点一。
    维尔利说，一九六六年国家计划和预算提出的任务是巨大的，但完全是可以实现的。这方面的保证是劳动人民群众的革命热情，是以霍查同志为首的党中央委员会的英明的和有远见的领导，是阿尔巴尼亚在全面发展经济和文化中所已经取得的成就。
