    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published a report on February 8 about leaders of some enterprises in the Northwest region discussing how to learn from Daqing, we have continuously received letters from employees of some enterprises, talking about their experiences and understandings in learning from Daqing. This newspaper plans to publish excerpts of these letters gradually. We hope that comrades will actively participate in the discussion of this issue so as to exchange experiences, inspire each other, and promote the activity of "learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, surpassing Daqing, and creating more Daqing-style enterprises" more widely and solidly.
    The letters from Jinzhou Railway Bureau and First Automobile Works published today propose that to learn from Daqing, we must establish our own "Daqing." This is a good question.
    The National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference recommended seventy Daqing-style enterprises to the whole country. In addition to Daqing Oilfield, the other sixty-nine Daqing-style advanced units can be said to be "Daqings" in various departments and regions. With each department and region having its own "Daqing," we can better learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing. One Daqing becomes seventy "Daqings," and seventy "Daqings" can become even more Daqings.
    Learning from Daqing should proceed from the specific conditions of each enterprise and should combine Daqing's advanced experience with the specific conditions of the enterprise. How to combine them? An important method is to combine learning Daqing's advanced experience with summarizing one's own advanced experience, just like the First Automobile Works, so that these experiences are gradually improved, gradually enhanced, and gradually promoted. As everyone knows, any advanced experience of fraternal units cannot take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit without one's own practice and without summarizing and promoting one's own experience.
    Every region, every unit, and every enterprise must summarize its own experience in learning from Daqing in order to truly learn Daqing's experience.

    To Establish Our Own "Daqing"
    To Make Daqing Experience Blossom and Bear Fruit in Our Unit, We Must Cultivate Models and Establish Our Own "Daqing"

    To truly learn Daqing's experience and make it take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit in our unit, we believe that learning from Daqing must be combined with summarizing our own experience and establishing our own "Daqing" in our unit.
    There are many benefits to cultivating models and establishing our own "Daqing" in our unit. Grasping typical examples, on the surface, is doing the work of a few people, but typical examples can play the role of "seeds" and "yeast," influencing and driving hundreds of units and tens of thousands of employees and their families in the overall situation. In reality, it is doing the work of the majority and driving the whole. Grasping typical examples is also a breakthrough in all work. Leading cadres can grasp the materials below through typical examples, gain the right to speak, and use the individual to guide the general. By grasping typical examples, the broad masses of employees have vivid learning models, can compare the gaps, and have a direction for advancement. Therefore, grasping typical examples is an important method of learning from Daqing and realizing living leadership.
    To grasp typical examples, we must first highlight politics, using the abstract to drive the concrete, so that the typical example can be held high, called out loudly, and stand firmly. In the past, our bureau also cultivated some typical examples in carrying out the "Full Over Five" (locomotive fully loaded, exceeding axle load and safe operation of five hundred kilometers) movement, but all comparisons were technical and economic indicators; the summed-up and promoted experience of Sun Fuyou in shunting, Yuan Chenglong in locomotive operation, and Yang Weixue in locomotive firing were all technical and business experiences. Therefore, the limitations were very large, and they could only be promoted in technical and business departments and individual types of work. Employees in other departments and types of work could not learn from them. Moreover, without highlighting politics, technical experience cannot be promoted well, and their vitality is very short-lived.
    Daqing has provided us with valuable experience in this regard. Daqing's grasping of typical examples such as Wang Tieh-jen and Team Four of the Third Mine all highlighted politics, focusing on summarizing how they grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and publicized the revolutionary spirit, noble style, and the fine tradition of hard struggle of the proletariat, becoming a living example for the broad masses of employees and promoting the ideological revolutionization of people. Daqing's experience gave us great inspiration. Later, when we summarized the experience of the Sunjia Engineering Zone, we did not simply summarize their road maintenance methods and how to move sand dunes, treat diseases, and eliminate weeds, but focused on summarizing their revolutionary spirit of being loyal to the Party and loyal to socialism and their revolutionary spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and their meticulous and conscientious work style. When summarizing the experience of Xinmin Station, we did not summarize how they beautified the station and decorated charts, etc., but focused on summarizing their idea of wholeheartedly serving the people. When summarizing Zhang Deyou's experience, we not only summarized how he practiced hard skills, but more importantly, we summarized what ideas he used to practice hard skills, highlighting his idea of "practicing for the people and practicing for the revolution." In this way, politics was highlighted, making the typical example truly a huge spiritual force to encourage everyone to achieve revolutionization. Typical examples summarized in this way are not limited by departments or types of work, and anyone in any department can learn from them. They have strong vitality and can be consolidated and sustained.
    Everything has two sides, and typical examples are no exception. In the past, it was believed that typical examples must be complete and flawless. Therefore, when summarizing typical examples, we only paid attention to the side of achievements and did not pay enough attention to shortcomings and problems. After the typical example was established, we were surprised to find certain shortcomings and problems, and instead of actively educating and improving them, we let them go. These are all one-sided.
    In this regard, Daqing's experience has also given us a lot of inspiration. We realize that the attitude towards typical examples should be two-sided, just like anything else. First, when discovering typical examples, we must comprehensively measure them, look at the mainstream, and look at the essence. As long as we see the signs, we must grasp them, help them, support them, and improve them to make them grow healthily. My bureau's advanced units, Sunjia Engineering Zone, Xinmin Station, and advanced figures such as Chen Shuren and Zhang Deyou, are not complete and flawless. For example, Xinmin Station initially had unbalanced development in various departments, with the passenger transport department being better than the freight transport and operation departments, and safety was not stable enough, but their spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people was the dominant aspect. We seized this advanced seedling and continued to help cultivate it, and it continued to improve. If the advanced seedling is unrealistically required to be too high, it will not be easy to discover typical examples. For example, some departments have also produced some relatively good teams in recent years, but because of the pursuit of being big and comprehensive, they have never established a flag of the overall situation that looks like it.
    Of course, cultivating typical examples must be realistic and cannot only pay attention to summarizing achievements and experience, but also point out shortcomings and problems so that advanced typical examples can see both their advantages and their disadvantages. In this way, advanced typical examples can continuously overcome shortcomings and continue to move forward.
    We believe that to realize the revolutionization of enterprises, all departments and units should have their own typical examples, but typical examples do not lie in quantity, but in quality. If there are too many, they will become generalized. One of our branch bureaus grasped hundreds of typical examples. Although the leaders put in a lot of effort, they still did not highlight the typical examples. The learning goals of the employees were not clear, and the actual effect was not great. The key to grasping more or less lies in what standards to use to grasp. Adhering to high standards and strict requirements makes the typical example refined and can produce top students. Advanced typical examples selected with high standards can play the role of "Daqing".

### 要树立自己的“大庆”  要使大庆经验在本单位开花结果，就要培养典型，树立自己的“大庆”

专栏：

    编者按　本报在二月八日发表了西北地区部分企业的领导人座谈怎样学大庆的报道以后，不断收到一些企业的职工写的信，谈他们学大庆的心得和体会。本报打算陆续择要选载。希望同志们热烈参加这个问题的议论，以便交流经验，互相启发，把“学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，创造更多的大庆式企业”的活动，更广泛更扎实地开展起来。
    今天发表的锦州铁路局和第一汽车制造厂的来信提出，要学大庆，就要树立自己的“大庆”，这个问题提得好。
    全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议向全国推荐了七十个大庆式企业。除了大庆油田，其他六十九个大庆式先进单位，都可以说是各个部门、各个地区的“大庆”。各个部门、各个地区有了自己的“大庆”，就能更好地学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆。一个大庆变成七十个“大庆”，七十个“大庆”就可以变成更多的大庆。
    学大庆应该从各个企业的具体情况出发，应该把大庆的先进经验同本企业的具体情况结合起来。怎样结合呢？一个重要的方法，就是要象第一汽车制造厂那样，把学习大庆的先进经验同总结自己的先进经验结合起来，使这些经验逐步完善，逐步提高，逐步推广。大家知道，兄弟单位的任何先进经验，不通过自己的实践，不通过总结和推广自己的经验，是不可能生根、发芽、开花、结果的。
    每个地区、每个单位、每个企业学大庆，都要总结自己的经验，这样才能把大庆的经验真正学到手。
    要树立自己的“大庆”
    要使大庆经验在本单位开花结果，就要培养典型，树立自己的“大庆”
    要把大庆经验真正学到手，在本单位扎根、发芽、开花、结果，我们认为，学大庆必须和总结自己的经验相结合，在本单位树立起自己的“大庆”。
    在本单位培养典型，树立自己的“大庆”有很多好处。抓典型，表面上看是做少数人的工作，可是典型能够起到“种子”“酵母”的作用，影响和带动全局上百个单位、几万名职工和家属，实际上是做了多数人的工作，带动了全面。抓典型也是一切工作的突破口。领导干部通过典型，掌握下面的材料，能够取得发言权，能够用个别指导一般。抓典型，广大职工有了活的学习榜样，能够比出差距，前进有了方向。因此，抓典型是学大庆、实现活的领导的一种重要方法。
    抓典型，首先必须突出政治，以虚带实，典型才能举得高，叫得响，站得稳。过去，我局在开展“满超五”（机车满载、超轴和安全运行五百公里）运动中，也培养了一些典型，但是比的都是技术经济指标；总结和推广的孙福佑调车经验、袁成龙机车操纵经验、杨维学机车焚火经验等，都是一些技术业务的经验。因此局限性很大，只能在技术业务部门和个别工种中推广，其它部门、工种的职工都学不了。而且不突出政治，技术经验也推广不好，它们的生命力很短促。
    大庆在这方面为我们提供了宝贵的经验。大庆抓王铁人、三矿四队等典型，都是突出政治，着重总结他们怎样在毛泽东思想哺育下成长，宣传了无产阶级的革命精神、高尚风格和艰苦奋斗的优良传统，成为广大职工的活榜样，推动了人的思想革命化。大庆的这个经验给我们很大启发，后来我们在总结孙家工区经验的时候，就没有单纯去总结他们的养路方法和怎样搬砂丘、治病害、灭草荒，而着重总结他们忠于党、忠于社会主义的革命精神和“愚公移山”的革命气概，精益求精、一丝不苟的作风。在总结新民车站经验的时候，我们没有总结他们怎样美化站容，装饰图表等，而是集中地总结了他们全心全意为人民服务的思想。总结张德有的经验时，不仅总结他怎样练硬功，更重要的是总结他用什么思想去练硬功，突出了他“为人民而练，为革命而练”的思想。这样就突出了政治，使典型真正成为鼓舞大家实现革命化的巨大精神力量。这样总结出来的典型不受部门、工种的限制，任何部门、任何人都可以学习，生命力强，能巩固持久。
    任何事物都是一分为二的，典型也不能例外。过去认为典型就必须完整无缺，因而在总结典型的时候，只注意成绩的一面，对缺点和问题注意不够。典型树立起来以后，发现某些缺点和问题，就大惊小怪，不去积极教育提高，而放任自流。这些都是片面的。
    在这方面，大庆的经验也给了我们不少启发。我们认识到，对典型的态度应该同任何事物一样要一分为二。首先，发现典型时要全面衡量，看主流，看本质。只要看准苗头，就要抓下去，帮助它，扶持它，提高它，使其健康成长。我局的先进单位孙家工区、新民车站和陈淑仁、张德有等先进人物，也不是完整无缺的。如新民车站，最初各部门发展不平衡，客运部门好于货运和运转部门，而且安全方面还不够稳固，但是他们全心全意为人民服务的精神是主导方面。我们抓住这个先进苗头，不断帮助培养，不断得到提高。假若对先进苗头不切实际的要求过高，就不易发现典型。譬如有的部门，几年来也涌现出一些比较好的班组，但由于贪大求全，始终没有树立起象个样子的全局旗帜。
    当然，培养典型必须实事求是，不能只注意总结成绩和经验，还要指出缺点和问题，使先进典型既看到自己的优点，也看到自己的缺点。这样，先进典型可以不断克服缺点、继续前进。
    我们认为，要实现企业革命化，各部门、各单位都应该有自己的典型，但是典型不在数量多，而在于精，过多了就成了一般化。我们有一个分局，抓了上百个典型，虽然领导费了很大劲，仍然没有把典型突出起来，职工学习目标不明确，实际效果也不大。抓多抓少的关键在于用什么标准去抓。坚持高标准，严要求，典型就精，就能出尖子。用高标准选出来的先进典型，才能起“大庆”的作用。
