    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, the eight-act drama "Andean Storm," created and performed by the Drama Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has been warmly welcomed and praised by drama circles, the general public, and Latin American foreign guests in Beijing. The audience believes that "Andean Storm" is a good play reflecting the oppressed people taking up arms and launching armed struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys. It powerfully illustrates the truth that where there is oppression, there is struggle, and shows that American imperialism can be defeated. Watching it is greatly encouraging and educational.
    At a symposium held by the Chinese Dramatists Association, Ouyang Shanzun, director of the China-Latin America Friendship Association and vice president of the Beijing People's Art Theater, and the famous playwright Li Jianwu, among others, warmly praised the drama for its profound theme and its high ideological and combative nature. Many viewers, after seeing the drama, also wrote letters to the theater troupe and newspapers, thanking the troupe for providing them with another living textbook of anti-American struggle. Many people also expressed in their letters that they would better study Chairman Mao's works, resolutely be promoters of world revolution, and support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    Latin American foreign guests in Beijing were very excited after watching "Andean Storm," praising the drama for realistically reflecting the raging anti-American revolutionary struggle in Latin America. They said that everything depicted in the drama could happen at any time and is happening all the time in any part of Latin America. Chilean expert Palacios and his wife Ana, and Brazilian expert Martins and his wife Maria, who came from the foothills of the Andes, excitedly ran backstage after the performance to shake hands with the actors one by one, congratulating them on the success of the performance, and said: "This is a performance with truly revolutionary content, the characters are very prominent, and it is very moving. This is your support for the Latin American people's revolution." Some Latin American foreign guests also introduced to the actors many revolutionary stories of the vigorous anti-American armed struggles launched by the people of their countries, exposing the crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys, the reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists, who use counter-revolutionary dual tactics of slaughter and deception to try to extinguish the flames of the Latin American people's revolutionary struggle. They expressed that as long as there are American invading bandits on the land of Latin America, they will fight forever and never lay down their weapons.

    据新华社十三日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部文工团话剧团创作并演出的八场话剧《安第斯山风暴》，受到首都戏剧界、广大观众和在北京的拉丁美洲外宾的热烈欢迎和赞扬。观众认为，《安第斯山风暴》是一个反映被压迫人民拿起武器和美国侵略者及其走狗展开武装斗争的好戏，它有力地说明了哪里有压迫，哪里就有斗争的真理，说明美帝国主义是可以打败的，看了受到极大的鼓舞和教育。
    在中国戏剧家协会举行的座谈会上，中国、拉丁美洲友好协会理事、北京人民艺术剧院副院长欧阳山尊，著名剧作家李健吾等，热烈称赞话剧主题深刻，具有很高的思想性和战斗性。许多观众看过话剧以后，还写信给剧团和报社，感谢剧团为他们提供了又一个反美斗争的活教材。许多人还在来信中表示，要更好地学习毛主席著作，坚决做世界革命的促进派，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争。
    在北京的拉丁美洲外宾，看了《安第斯山风暴》，心情都很激动，称赞话剧真实地反映了拉丁美洲如火如荼的反美革命斗争的形势。他们说，话剧中表现的一切，在拉丁美洲任何地方随时都可能发生，也随时都在发生着。来自安第斯山山麓的智利专家帕拉西奥斯和他的夫人安娜，巴西专家马尔丁斯和他的夫人玛丽娅看完演出后，激动地跑到后台同演员一一握手，祝贺演出成功，并说：“这是一场具有真正革命内容的演出，人物形象很突出，非常感动人，这是你们对拉丁美洲人民革命的支持。”一些拉丁美洲外宾，还给演员们介绍了许多他们国家人民展开的轰轰烈烈反美武装斗争的革命故事，揭露美帝国主义及其走狗各国反动派、现代修正主义者，用屠杀和欺骗的反革命两手，企图扑灭拉丁美洲人民革命斗争烈火的罪行。他们表示，只要在拉丁美洲的土地上还有美国侵略强盗，他们就要永远战斗下去，绝不放下手中武器。
