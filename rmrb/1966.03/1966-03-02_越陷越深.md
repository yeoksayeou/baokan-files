　　Chen Yi, the Vice Premier, said last September when discussing the issue of economic independence and self-reliance of Asian and African countries: “Relying on American aid, the bread will become less and less.” India is a typical example. Even India's bourgeois newspapers admit this frankly.

　　Because of accepting American “aid” and loans, India has not only had to endure heavy exploitation and bear a heavy debt for several years, but also has opened the door wide to American capital, resulting in the decline of its national economy and the impoverishment of its people. The deeper India's economic difficulties become, the more the Indian ruling clique has to rely on American "aid" to survive. This forms a vicious cycle, making India's national economic situation worse and worse.

　　The most fundamental reason why India's famine has reached such a serious point is that the Indian ruling clique maintains the feudal exploitative land system, causing grain production to decrease rather than increase. Instead, the Indian authorities abandon the fundamental and pursue the incidental, increasingly relying on American "aid" in grain to solve the difficulties. This approach further deepens India's agricultural crisis. This is perfectly clear.

　　The so-called "aid" from the United States is never free. Accepting American "aid" inevitably harms the national interests of the recipient country. How can their lives get better? Relying on American aid, the bread will become less and less; that's the logic.

　　American “aid” has already caused serious harm in India, but the Indian ruling clique is like an opium addict, unable to survive without American “aid”. Recently, they asked the United States for another 100 million US dollars in "aid." Let's see how bad India's economy will become.

    越陷越深
    陈毅副总理去年九月在谈到亚非国家的经济独立自主问题时说过：“依靠美国援助，面包会越来越少”。印度就是一个典型的例子。关于这一点，连印度的资产阶级报纸也直认不讳了。
    由于接受美国的“援助”和贷款，印度几年来不但必须忍受重利盘剥，背上了一身债，而且给美国资本大开方便之门，结果弄得本国经济雕蔽，民穷财尽。印度的经济困难越是加深，印度统治集团就越是要靠美“援”过日子。这样就形成一种恶性循环，使得印度的国民经济状况越来越恶化。
    印度的粮荒闹到如此严重地步，最根本的原因是印度统治集团保持封建剥削的土地制度，使粮食生产有减无增。而印度当局反而舍本求末，越来越多地依赖美国
  “援助”粮食来解决困难，这种做法就更加深了印度的农业危机。这是明明白白的事情。
    美国的所谓“援助”，从来就不会是白给的。接受了美“援”，就不可能不损害本国的民族利益，日子怎么能好过得了呢？依靠美国援助，面包会越来越少，道理就在这里。
    美“援”早已在印度造成了严重的恶果，但是，印度统治集团有如上了瘾的鸦片鬼，离开美
  “援”就过不了日子。最近，他们又从美国要了一亿美元的“援助”。且看印度的经济还会糟到什么样子吧。
