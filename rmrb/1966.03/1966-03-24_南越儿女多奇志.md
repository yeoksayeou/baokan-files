    South Vietnamese Sons and Daughters Have Lofty Aspirations
    Chinese News Delegation
    When we heard one victory after another from the South Vietnamese military and civilians on the South Vietnamese battlefield, we rejoiced and celebrated their victories with them. However, these victories were not easily won, nor were they achieved without a price. For these victories, millions of heroic sons and daughters of South Vietnam paid a great deal of labor and hardship, sweat and blood, and dedicated all their strength and talent.

      Triumphant Songs of Heroic Troops
    During our visit, we spent many unforgettable days with the soldiers of the South Vietnam Liberation Army. We heard the triumphant songs of their revolutionary heroism, how they highly developed their courage and spirit of sacrifice in fierce battles, using all their strength to overwhelm the enemy without being intimidated by them. We also saw their tense and arduous lives, how they always maintained the spirit of revolutionary optimism, using various methods to overcome difficulties without being hindered by them. This spirit of not fearing hardship or death has enabled this people's army to grow in arduous battles and become an invincible and all-conquering force.
    Shortly after the Liberation Army annihilated more than 2,000 American soldiers of the U.S. First Infantry Division in the Bau Bang area on November 12 last year, we rushed to visit the camp of a heroic unit that participated in this battle. This was an ancient forest stretching for hundreds of miles. The commanders and political workers of this unit pointed to the sand table made of soil depicting the Bau Bang battle and said to us, "This annihilation battle was fought very bravely and flexibly. More than 2,000 men of the U.S. First Infantry Division were camping in a rubber forest, never dreaming that we would come so quickly. Within more than ten minutes after the attack was launched, its headquarters was completely destroyed. The soldiers fought very bravely, especially the platoon that launched the initial attack, which fought decisively and stubbornly."
    The task of this platoon was to launch the initial attack against the enemy, attract the enemy's fire, and cover the fraternal troops in destroying the enemy's headquarters. As expected, after the battle started, more than ten enemy tanks guarding the campsite quickly reinforced in this direction, bombarding fiercely with artillery fire. American infantry, awakened from their sleep, also jumped out of their beds and desperately resisted with various weapons. The soldiers used rows of rubber trees as cover, using hand grenades and submachine guns to destroy enemy tanks and kill and wound the enemy. Platoon leader Nguyen Ba suffered a chest wound but continued to calmly command the battle. Anti-tank gunners rolled through the long, thorny cogon grass to open the field of fire for the anti-tank guns, fiercely bombarding enemy tanks. Anti-tank gunner A Lien destroyed an enemy tank with one shot, but suddenly a piece of shrapnel hit his chest, causing serious injury. However, he persisted in firing fiercely at the enemy. The soldiers firmly held back the enemy, persisting to the last minute.
    At this moment, a violent explosion finally erupted behind the enemy, and the fraternal troops broke into the enemy's headquarters. The enemy wavered. Platoon leader Nguyen Ba immediately raised his submachine gun and shouted, "Comrades, resolutely hold them back, the time has come to perform meritorious service for the people!" He led the soldiers to charge at the enemy. Although this platoon suffered heavy casualties in the battle, it paved the way for the victory of the entire battle.

      Achievements of a Female Guerrilla Captain
    No matter which village or town we visited, no matter which unit or organization we visited, we were deeply moved by the high level of awareness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the South Vietnamese people. In this great people's war, everyone, from gray-haired old men to young girls and innocent children, became heroic warriors, contributing all their strength to the cause of national liberation. They have been tempered as strong as steel in arduous battles, and they are not intimidated by any difficulties or any enemies.
    We visited female guerrilla captain A Xin in a certain county of Quang Nam Province in the coastal area of ​​Central Trung Bo. In a house with a thatched roof already damaged and earthen walls already peeling off on the edge of the village, we saw female guerrilla captain A Xin. This famous female guerrilla fighter was originally a petite, dark-skinned rural girl in her twenties. She was squatting on the ground, discussing a battle plan to oppose the enemy's grain grabbing with several male and female guerrillas. She came over to warmly greet us. She talked about the glorious victories achieved by the guerrillas in this county in the battle against the American aggressors, and talked about the continuous expansion and consolidation of the liberated areas in this county that stretched under the enemy's nose, but she did not talk about her own heroic deeds of killing the enemy. In fact, her bravery and resourcefulness are widely spread among the local people. Her father worked as a hired hand for a landlord and was killed by the French devils in a "sweep." Later, under the rule of the American puppet clique, she and her mother sometimes did odd jobs for the landlord and sometimes begged for food, leading a wandering life. After joining the guerrillas, she had participated in dozens of battles, large and small, killing and wounding many enemies.
    Once, Nguyen Bang, a local bully hated by everyone, summoned the people nearby to the stronghold to threaten them and demand that they hand over money and food. She and several female guerrillas mixed into the crowd and entered the stronghold. When the bully came over to speak to the crowd, she pulled out her pistol and fired four shots in a row, killing the bastard. By the time a large number of puppet troops rushed over, they had already run out of the stronghold under the cover of the masses.
    Another time, she led several female guerrillas to ambush on the highway. Soon, an American jeep drove from Da Nang. She shot and killed the driver with one shot, and the two American "advisors" in the car were so frightened that they immediately raised their hands in surrender. When the two Americans saw that they were all women, they gestured and said a few stuttering Vietnamese words to them, indicating that if they were released back to the stronghold, they could give a lot of American dollars. She was so angry that she shouted: "We are the people's guerrillas. Your guns can't scare us, and your money can't buy us. Follow us obediently!"

        The Experience of a Little Hero
    We also visited a little hero, A Ji, in a fishing village by the sea in a certain county of Quang Ngai Province in Central Trung Bo. When we walked into this battle village through traps and minefields, sharp stakes and bamboo fences, the person in charge of the National Liberation Front of this village pointed to the beach outside the village and said affectionately, "This little devil is on sentry duty on the beach."
    We found this little hero in a single-person bunker under a coconut tree. He turned out to be a chubby fifteen-year-old boy, wearing a white short coat and trousers, and carrying an American carbine. This child, who grew up in battle, still retained the innocence of his childhood. He had a wide American leather belt tied around his waist, which was full of various things he loved, including American hand grenades, a slingshot for hitting birds, a leather ammunition box containing bullets, and another leather box containing small stones for hitting birds. However, when he saw American warships passing by on the sea and watched their activities with such alert eyes, it was impossible to tell that he was a child.
    This child grew up in the bloody storm of the American puppet group's massacre. His father was a cadre in this village during the anti-French war and was brutally killed by the American puppet group. His mother was hunted by the enemy everywhere. Finally, she handed this eight-year-old child over to the guerrillas and ran away herself. This child grew up under the care of the guerrillas, and by the age of ten, he had become a clever scout. He often led the guerrillas into the enemy's strongholds, ambushed on the highways, and delivered letters to the guerrillas. He also climbed to the barbed wire outside the enemy's strongholds at night to dismantle the enemy's hand grenades, and then placed these hand grenades on the roads often traveled by the enemy, killing and wounding many enemies. Once, he put a hand grenade into the enemy's rice pot. When the enemy opened the pot lid, the hand grenade exploded.
    After telling the story of his heroic killing of the enemy, this little hero said to us in a resolute tone, "We will resolutely eliminate the American devils, avenge our parents, and avenge the parents who were killed by the American devils all over the world."

      The Miracle of a Model Village Supporting the Front
    Resolutely eliminate the American devils! We heard this firm will and heroic oath of the South Vietnamese people everywhere we visited. In order to eliminate the American aggressors, regardless of gender, age, they support their own soldiers with every bit of strength and every grain of food.
    We visited a famous model village supporting the front on the Thap Muoi Plain. As we approached the village, we saw the lively scene of the whole village enthusiastically preparing for the dry season battles. Many women, the elderly, and children were repairing the traffic trenches, bunkers, and traps around the village that had been damaged by rainwater during the rainy season, burying landmines, planting bamboo spikes, and preparing to counterattack the enemy's dry season "sweeps." Many young people were making stretchers and sharpening carrying poles in the open space, preparing to go to the front line to support the Liberation Army.
    The heroic deeds of the masses in this village enthusiastically supporting the Liberation Army in eliminating the enemy have become a model for the local people to learn from. In May last year, the rainy season had already begun, and it was raining heavily, and the river was rising sharply. One night, dense gunfire suddenly rang out, and a fire broke out in the enemy stronghold not far away. A large group of Liberation Army soldiers came to the village and asked to help them cross the river immediately to block the fleeing enemy. However, there were not many boats for crossing the river in this village, and the river was very wide, and it would take a long time to cross one boat. At this moment of great anxiety, the masses came up with a good idea. Many young men and women, and even some elderly people, jumped into the river and connected seven boats together, building a pontoon bridge. They braved the torrential rain and surging river water, and supported the boats with their shoulders and chests, stabilizing the bridge. The Liberation Army soldiers were very excited and wanted to jump into the water as well. The masses shouted, "Go quickly, go and eliminate the enemy." When the soldiers passed over this pontoon bridge, they shouted excitedly, "Comrades, we will answer you by completely eliminating the enemy." The large group of Liberation Army soldiers quickly crossed the river and rushed towards the burning enemy stronghold.
    The great victory of the anti-American national salvation struggle on the South Vietnamese battlefield is the common victory of millions of heroic South Vietnamese sons and daughters, and it is also the brilliant victory of the South Vietnamese people's war. The American aggressors have become increasingly trapped in this vast ocean of people's war. No matter how high it "gradually escalates," no matter how much it increases its troops, weapons, and military spending, it cannot save the American aggressors from their doom. (Attached picture)

    南越儿女多奇志
    中国新闻代表团
    我们在越南南方战场上听到南越军民一个又一个捷报传来的时候，同他们一起欢欣鼓舞，一起庆祝战斗的胜利。但是，这些胜利不是轻易得来的，也不是毫无代价地得来的。为了这些胜利，越南南方千百万英雄儿女付出了巨大的劳动和艰辛、汗水和鲜血，献出了他们自己全部的力量和才智。
      英雄部队的凯歌
    我们在访问中同越南南方解放军的战士们一起，度过了许多难忘的日子。我们听到了他们革命英雄主义的凯歌，他们在激烈的战斗中，高度发扬勇敢和牺牲精神，用一切力量压倒敌人，而不被敌人所吓倒。我们也看到了他们紧张和艰苦的生活，他们始终保持革命乐观主义的精神，用各种办法来克服困难，而不被困难所阻挡。这种不怕苦、不怕死的精神，使这支人民军队在艰苦的战斗中成长起来，成为战无不胜、攻无不克的坚强力量。
    在去年十一月十二日解放军在保邦地区一举歼灭美军第一步兵师二千多人以后不久，我们赶去访问了参加这次战斗的一支英雄部队的营地。这是一片绵延数百里的古老的森林。这支部队的指挥人员和政治工作人员手指着用沙土制作的这次保邦战斗的沙盘对我们说，“这次歼灭战打得很勇猛、很灵活。美国第一步兵师的二千多人正在一片橡胶林里宿营，做梦也没有想到我们来得这么快。从发动攻击以后十多分钟内，就完全打烂了它的指挥部。战士们个个打得非常勇猛，特别是首先发动攻击的一个排，打得又坚决又顽强。”
    这个排的任务是首先向敌人发动攻击，吸引敌人的火力，掩护兄弟部队捣毁敌人的指挥部。果然，战斗打响后，守卫宿营地四周的十多辆敌人战车迅速向这个方向增援，用猛烈的炮火进行轰击，从睡梦中惊醒的美国步兵也从地铺上跳起来，用各种武器拼命顽抗。战士们利用一排排的橡胶树作为掩护，用手雷和冲锋枪炸毁敌人的战车，杀伤敌人。排长阮坝左胸负了伤，继续沉着地指挥作战。反坦克炮手们用身体在带尖刺的长长的茅草上滚进，为反坦克炮打开射界，对敌人战车进行猛烈轰击。反坦克炮手阿连一炮击毁了敌人的一辆战车，突然一块弹片打进了他的前胸负了重伤，但是他仍坚持向敌人猛烈开炮。战士们牢牢地拖住了敌人，坚持到最后一分钟。
    这时，敌人背后终于发出了猛烈爆炸的巨响，兄弟部队突入敌人的指挥部了。敌人动摇起来。排长阮坝立刻举起冲锋枪高喊道，“同志们，坚决拖住他们，为人民立功的时候到了！”他率领战士们向敌人冲杀过去。这个排在战斗中虽然遭到了较大的伤亡，但是为整个战斗的胜利开辟了道路。
      女游击队长的功勋
    我们不论访问哪个村庄和市镇，也不论访问哪个部队和单位，都为南越人民这种高度的觉悟、勇敢和自我牺牲的精神深深激动着。在这伟大的人民战争中，他们每个人，从白发苍苍的老大爷，年青的姑娘和带着稚气的少年儿童，都变成了英勇的战士，为祖国解放的事业贡献他们全部的力量。他们在艰苦的战斗中锻炼得象钢铁一样坚强，不管甚么样的困难，甚么样的敌人，都吓不倒他们。
    我们在中部中区沿海的广南省某县访问了女游击队长阿心。在村子边上一间茅草顶已经破坏，土墙已经剥落的屋子里，我们看到了女游击队长阿心。这个著名的女游击战士原来是一个身材瘦小、肤色黝黑的二十多岁的农村姑娘。她正蹲在地上，同好几个男女游击队员讨论反对敌人抢粮的战斗计划。她走过来热情地招待我们。她谈到了这个县的游击队在同美国侵略军的战斗中取得的光辉胜利，谈到了这个县伸在敌人鼻子底下的解放区不断扩大和巩固，但是没有谈到她自己英勇杀敌的事迹。其实，她的英勇和机智在当地群众中是传播很广的。她的父亲给地主当过雇工，被法国鬼子在一次“扫荡”中杀害了。后来，在美伪集团统治下，她和母亲有时给地主做些零活，有时讨饭，过着流浪的生活。她加入游击队后，已参加了大小几十次战斗，打死打伤了许多敌人。
    有一次，当地一个人人痛恨的大恶霸阮邦把附近的群众召到据点去进行威胁，要他们缴钱缴粮。她同几个女游击队员混在人群中进入了据点。等这个恶霸走过来向群众讲话的时候，她就掏出手枪连放四枪，打死了这个坏蛋。等大批伪军赶过来时，她们早就在群众的掩护下，跑出了据点。
    还有一次，她带着几个女游击队员在公路上打埋伏。不久，从岘港方面开来了一辆美国吉普车。她一枪就把开车的打死了，车上的两个美国“顾问”吓得立刻举手投降。这两个美国佬一看都是些妇女，就用手势和几句结结巴巴的越南话对她们表示，如果把他们放回据点，他们就可给很多美金。她气得大喝一声：“我们是人民的游击队，你们的枪吓不倒，钱也买不倒，快老老实实跟我们走！”
        小英雄的经历
    我们还在中部中区广义省某县一个临海的渔村里访问了一个小英雄阿集。当我们穿过陷阱和地雷阵、尖桩和竹篱笆走进这个战斗村的时候，这个村子的民族解放阵线的负责人指着村子外面的海滩亲昵地说，“这个小鬼在海边放哨呢”。
    我们在一棵椰子树下的单人掩体里找到了这个小英雄，他原来是一个十五岁的长得胖呼呼的孩子，穿着一套白色的短褂和裤子，背着一支美国卡宾枪。这个在战斗中成长起来的孩子还保持着童年的稚气，他腰里扎着一条很宽的美国皮带，上面挂满了各种各样他心爱的东西，有美国的手榴弹，也有打鸟的弹弓，一只皮弹药盒里装着子弹，另一只皮盒里却是打鸟的小石子。但是，当他看到海面上驶过美国军舰，用那样警觉的眼光注视它们的活动时，就一点也看不出是一个孩子了。
    这个孩子是在美伪集团大屠杀的血雨腥风中成长起来的。他的父亲在抗法战争中是这个村的干部，被美伪集团残酷杀害了，他的母亲到处被敌人追捕。最后，她把这个只有八岁的孩子交给了游击队，自己跑出去了。这个孩子在游击队员的抚养下成长起来，到十岁的时候就已经成为一个机灵的侦察员了。他经常带领着游击队摸进敌人据点去，到公路上打伏击，给游击队送信。他还在夜晚爬到敌军据点外面的铁丝网边上去拆掉敌人的手榴弹，然后把这些手榴弹放置在敌人经常走过的道路上，炸死炸伤了很多敌人。有一次，他把一颗手榴弹放进了敌人的饭锅里去。等敌人一开锅盖，手榴弹就爆炸了。
    这个小英雄在讲完他英勇杀敌的故事后，用坚决的语调对我们说，“我们坚决消灭美国鬼子，给我们的爸爸妈妈报仇，也给全世界被美国鬼子杀死的爸爸妈妈报仇”。
      支前模范村的奇迹
    坚决消灭美国鬼子！我们在访问中到处都听到了南越人民的这种坚定的意志和英雄的誓言。为了消灭美国侵略者，他们不分男女老幼，把每一分力量，每一颗粮食，支援自己的子弟兵。
    我们在塔梅平原上访问了一个有名的支前模范村。我们走近村子时，就看到了全村群众轰轰烈烈的准备旱季战斗的生动场面。许多妇女、老年人和孩子都在村子周围修复在雨季中被雨水冲坏了的交通壕、掩体和陷阱，在埋地雷，布竹签，准备反击敌人的旱季“扫荡”。许多年青人在场地上扎担架、削扁担，准备出发到前线去支援解放军。
    这个村子的群众热烈支援解放军消灭敌人的英勇事迹，已成为当地人民学习的榜样。去年五月，雨季已经开始，大雨下个不停，河水猛涨起来。在一个夜晚，突然响起了密集的枪炮声，距离不很远的敌军据点里冲起了大火。大队解放军来到了村子，要求帮助他们马上渡过河去，堵击溃逃的敌人。但是，这个村子渡河的船只不多，而且河水很大，渡过一船去要花很多时间。正在万分着急的时候，群众想出了好办法。许多男女青壮年，甚至还有一些老年人跳下河去，把七条船接连在一起，搭成了一座浮桥。他们冒着倾盆大雨和汹涌的河水，用肩膀和胸膛顶住船只，稳住了这座桥。解放军战士们非常激动，也要跳下水去。群众高喊说，“你们快走，快去消灭敌人。”战士们在通过这座浮桥的时候，个个激动地高喊道，“乡亲们，我们要以全部消灭敌人来回答你们。”大队的解放军迅速地通过了这条河，向火光冲天的敌军据点冲去。
    南越战场上抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利，是千百万英雄的南越儿女共同的胜利，也是南越人民战争光辉的胜利。美国侵略者已在这人民战争的汪洋大海中越陷越深，不管它“逐步升级”升到哪一级，也不管它增加多少兵力、武器和军费，都挽救不了美国侵略者的没顶之灾。（附图片）
