    The 1966 national budget and fiscal investment and loan program forcibly passed by the Sato government in the Japanese House of Representatives clearly exposes the reactionary essence of the Sato government, which only cares about the wealth of Japanese monopoly capitalists and disregards the lives of the broad masses of the people.
    In recent years, due to the reactionary policies of the Japanese ruling clique that harm the country and the people, Japan's economic situation has deteriorated. Especially since the Sato government came to power, prices have soared, taxes have increased sharply, and people's lives have become increasingly difficult. Instead of taking effective measures to alleviate the people's plight, the Sato government has intensified its efforts to plunder the people's wealth, serve the monopoly capital groups, and actively push Japan onto the road of war.
    The purpose of this budget and fiscal investment and loan program, which amounts to more than six trillion yen, is to further strengthen the plunder of the Japanese people, step up the pursuit of the US imperialist policies of aggression and war, revive the economic foundation of militarism, and serve the Japanese monopoly capital in overcoming serious economic difficulties and expanding overseas.
    In this budget, Japan's military expenditure has reached the highest amount since the war, and loans for overseas expansion and fiscal investment have increased significantly compared with the previous year. In order to raise the funds needed for the budget and make up for the financial difficulties, the Sato government does not hesitate to issue a large number of "deficit bonds" and uses methods such as increasing taxes and raising public utility fees to plunder the people's pockets.
    The Sato government's perverse actions, thinking they are clever, are actually bringing calamity upon themselves. Not only will it not be able to overcome the increasingly serious economic difficulties, but it will also make the economic difficulties more profound and complex. More importantly, this reactionary economic policy of internal oppression and external expansion will inevitably further intensify the class contradictions and national contradictions in Japan, making the broad masses of the Japanese people who suffer from it more aware of the reactionary face of the Sato government and arouse more resolute and powerful struggles. Now, people from all walks of life in Japan have voiced strong protests against Sato's economic policies. Japanese political parties and organizations have decided to launch a nationwide unified action against the US-Japanese reactionaries on March 20, giving the Sato government a heavy blow. It is foreseeable that the Japanese people's anti-US patriotic struggle will develop more rapidly, and the Sato government's reactionary policy of antagonizing the Japanese people will not end well.

### 自取其祸

    自取其祸
    日本佐藤政府强使日本众议院通过的一九六六年度国家预算和财政投资贷款计划，清楚地暴露了佐藤政府只顾日本垄断资本家发财、不顾广大人民死活的反动实质。
    近年来，由于日本统治集团执行祸国殃民的反动政策，使得日本的经济情况每况愈下。特别是佐藤政府上台以来，物价猛涨，捐税激增，人民生活越来越困苦。佐藤政府不仅不采取一些有效的措施以舒民困，反而变本加厉地搜刮民财，为垄断资本集团服务，积极把日本推向战争的道路。
    现在它精心编制的这个高达六万多亿日元的预算和财政投资贷款计划，目的就是要进一步加强对日本人民的掠夺，加紧追随美帝国主义侵略和战争政策、复活军国主义的经济基础，为日本垄断资本度过严重经济困难和向海外扩张效劳。
    在这个预算中，日本的军费支出达到了战后以来的最高额，用于海外扩张和财政投资的贷款都比上一年有了很大的增加。为了筹措预算所需的资金和弥补财源的困窘，佐藤政府不惜发行大量“赤字公债”，并且通过加重税收、提高公用事业费用等手段，大肆搜刮人民的腰包。
    佐藤政府这样倒行逆施，自以为得法，其实是自取其祸。它不仅不能克服日益严重的经济困难，反而会使经济困难更加深刻化、复杂化。更加重要的是，这种对内压榨对外扩张的反动经济政策，必然会使日本的阶级矛盾和民族矛盾进一步加剧起来，使深受其害的日本广大人民更加认识到佐藤政府的反动面目，而激起更加坚决有力的斗争。现在，日本各阶层人民已经发出了抗议佐藤经济政策的强大呼声。日本各政党团体决定在三月二十日展开反对美日反动派的全国统一行动，给佐藤政府以沉重的打击。可以预见，日本人民的反美爱国斗争必将更加迅猛地发展起来，佐藤政府与日本人民为敌的反动政策是决不会有好结果的。
