	"The people understand that the legal path is exhausted. The people understand that only the path of armed struggle remains." This is a famous saying by Camilo Torres, a prominent figure in Colombia, when he joined the patriotic armed struggle. Now, Torres has gloriously sacrificed in battle. However, this truth he pointed out has been grasped by more and more patriots in Colombia.
	Oppressed people and oppressed nations are not born loving bloodshed. However, imperialism and reactionaries always force them to a dead end. When peaceful means fail, they have no choice but to resort to force. The people of Colombia, like revolutionary people in many other countries, have been forced to take up arms to carry out revolutionary struggle. Now, the flames of armed struggle have been ignited throughout Colombia, and they are burning brighter and brighter, making U.S. imperialism and its running dogs tremble with fear.
	Under the instigation of the United States, the reactionary government of Colombia attempts to frantically suppress the patriotic guerrilla armed forces, repeatedly launching large-scale "encirclements and suppressions," with extreme viciousness. However, the result is that the more the guerrillas are "suppressed," the more there are, and the more the guerrilla areas are "encircled," the wider they become. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "All reactionaries attempt to eliminate revolution by means of massacre. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will become. But contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force becomes, and the closer the reactionaries are to their demise." This irresistible law will once again be verified in Colombia.

### 越“剿”越多

专栏：短评

     越“剿”越多
    “人民懂得合法的道路已经走完了。人民懂得只剩下了一条武装斗争的道路。”这是哥伦比亚著名人士卡米洛·托雷斯在参加爱国武装斗争时所说的一句名言。现在，托雷斯在战斗中光荣牺牲了。但是，他所指出的这一真理，已为哥伦比亚越来越多的爱国者所掌握。
    被压迫人民和被压迫民族都不是生来就喜爱流血的。但是，帝国主义和反动派总是把他们迫得无路可走。文的行不通了，他们就只好来武的。哥伦比亚的人民，也和其他许多国家的革命人民一样，是被迫拿起武器来进行革命斗争的。现在，武装斗争的烽火已经在哥伦比亚各地燃起，而且越燃越旺，使得美帝国主义和它的走狗心惊胆战。
    哥伦比亚反动政府在美国指使下，企图对爱国游击武装力量进行疯狂的镇压，一再发动大规模的“围剿”，凶恶万分。但是，结果是游击队越“剿”越多，游击区越“围”越广。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。”这一条不可抗拒的法则，将在哥伦比亚又一次得到验证。
