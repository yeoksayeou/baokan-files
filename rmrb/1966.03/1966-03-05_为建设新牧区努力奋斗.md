    Strive to Build a New Pastoral Area
    Wanma Xian (Tibetan, female), Deputy County Head of Luqu County, Gansu Province
    I was deeply moved when I finished reading the newsletter "The Model of a County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu" and the *People's Daily* editorial "Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a Good Student of Comrade Mao Zedong," and I couldn't calm down for a long time. Comrade Jiao Yulu creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, was loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and established a proletarian revolutionary worldview that did not seek fame or fortune, and was not afraid of hardship or death. Comrade Jiao Yulu's ambition to rely on the masses, lead the masses, overcome natural disasters, and change the face of Lankao deeply touched me and educated me, causing me to spontaneously examine myself and make corrections.
    I also came from a poor family and suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation in that cannibalistic old society. After liberation, the Party painstakingly cultivated me for more than ten years, making me a cadre of the country. But upon examination, I have done too little for the people, far inferior to Comrade Jiao Yulu. The Party recently sent me to Luqu County to take on leadership work, and I was always afraid of not being able to shoulder this responsibility well. After learning about Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary deeds, my determination has grown, and my enthusiasm has increased. I will creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like him, and temper and transform myself in actual struggle. In my work, I will be as responsible, courageous in struggle, and daring to overcome and defeat all difficulties as Comrade Jiao Yulu. I will establish deep feelings with every blade of grass and every tree in Luqu, and devote myself heart and soul to the socialist revolution and construction in the pastoral area.

    为建设新牧区努力奋斗
    甘肃碌曲县副县长　万玛仙（藏族，女）
    我怀着激动的心情，一口气读完了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》的通讯和《人民日报》社论《向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习》，很久不能平静。焦裕禄同志活学活用毛主席著作，忠于毛泽东思想，树立不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死的无产阶级革命世界观；焦裕禄同志依靠群众，领导群众，战胜自然灾害，改变兰考面貌的雄心壮志，深深地感动了我，教育了我，使我不由自主地对照自己，作了检查。
    我也是贫苦家庭出身的人，在那吃人的旧社会里，受尽了压迫和剥削。解放后，党费尽心血把我培养了十多年，使我成为国家的干部。但检查起来，我为人民做的事情太少了，比起焦裕禄同志就差得太远了。党最近又派我到碌曲县担任领导工作，自己总怕挑不好这个担子。学了焦裕禄同志的革命事迹，决心大了，劲头足了，我要象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，在实际斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己。工作上要象焦裕禄同志那样勇于负责，敢于斗争，敢于克服和战胜一切困难。和碌曲的一草一木建立深厚的感情，为牧区的社会主义革命和建设事业鞠躬尽瘁。
