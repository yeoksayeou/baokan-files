    The telegram expressed respect to all Ghanaian youth and people who are determined to crush the rebellion subservient to British imperialism. The telegram expressed its firm belief that the Ghanaian youth and people will demonstrate a high degree of political awareness, take up arms and fight until the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, and for peace and African independence, is carried through to final victory.
    The telegram guaranteed unconditional support for the Ghanaian youth and people. It said that the Guinean African Democratic Revolution Youth Organization, together with the Guinean People's Army, will dedicate all its energy and creative power to the cause of the true liberation of the African people who are fighting against imperialism and its puppets.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, 6th - Abd al-Rahman, Chairman of the Sudanese People's Democratic Party, said on the 3rd regarding the coup d'état in Ghana that imperialism wants to use Ghana as a base to attack newly independent African countries that are struggling to consolidate their independence.

    The statement said: Imperialism is trying to stifle the freedom of the people of Asian and African countries. But from the perspective of historical development, imperialism is doomed to failure, because the liberation movement of the ruled and exploited people of all countries is irresistible.
    In the statement, the Permanent Secretariat expressed its firm belief that the glorious Ghanaian people will never let imperialist exploiters take away their revolutionary fruits, and they will always be loyal to the correct path they have pioneered.
    The Secretariat reiterated its unconditional support for the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism and against new and old colonialism.
