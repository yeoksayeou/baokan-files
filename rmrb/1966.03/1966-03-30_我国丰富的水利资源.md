　　Our country has numerous rivers, and its water resources are extremely abundant. According to statistics, there are more than 1,580 large and medium-sized rivers with drainage areas of over 1,000 square kilometers, with an average annual total water volume of 2,680 billion cubic meters. The most famous are the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Huai River, Hai River, Pearl River, Liao River, and Songhua River, among which the Yangtze River and Pearl River have the most abundant water volume, and the Yellow River and Yangtze River have the largest drainage areas. There are also dotted natural lakes throughout the country, as well as a large number of small rivers and streams and abundant underground water sources. All of these provide very favorable conditions for our country to develop farmland irrigation and prosper the entire national economy.
　　Since liberation, the Party and government have attached great importance to the development of water conservancy. Especially since 1958, relying on the enthusiasm of the 500 million peasants who have embarked on the path of communization, great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction. Millions of small-scale water conservancy and soil conservation projects have been built across the country, more than 1,000 large and medium-sized backbone projects have been newly built, and a total of nearly 130,000 kilometers of river dikes have been repaired and newly built. A large number of electromechanical drainage and irrigation stations and irrigation wells have been developed. These water conservancy facilities have improved the flood control and drainage capacity in many places, and the irrigated area in the country has increased several times, initially building a batch of high and stable yield farmlands that are guaranteed against drought and flood. However, our country's existing water conservancy facilities are far from meeting the needs of national economic development; the existing water conservancy projects still have great potential to be tapped and benefits to be further expanded. Therefore, further controlling mountains, rivers, and fields, and repairing, managing, and utilizing water conservancy projects well, and striving for stable and high agricultural yields, is still a long-term and arduous struggle task for the people of our country.

### 我国丰富的水利资源

    我国丰富的水利资源
    我国河流众多，水利资源非常丰富。据统计，流域面积在一千平方公里以上的大、中河流，就有一千五百八十多条，多年平均总水量为二万六千八百亿立方米。最著名的是长江、黄河、淮河、海河、珠江、辽河和松花江，其中又以长江和珠江水量最丰沛，黄河和长江流域面积最大。各地还有星罗棋布的天然湖泊，以及大量的小河小溪和充沛的地下水源。所有这些，都为我国发展农田灌溉以及繁荣整个国民经济，提供了十分有利条件。
    解放以来，党和政府对发展水利事业极为重视。特别是一九五八年以来，依靠走上公社化道路的五亿农民的积极性，水利建设取得很大成绩，全国建成了数以百万计的小型水利和水土保持工程，新建了一千多处大、中型骨干工程，整修和新修了总长近十三万公里的江河堤防，发展了大量的机电排灌站和灌溉机井。这些水利设施，提高了不少地方的抗洪除涝能力，使全国灌溉面积有了成倍的增长，初步建成了一批旱涝保收稳产高产农田。但是，我国现有的水利设施，还远远不能满足国民经济发展的需要；已有的水利工程，还可大挖潜力，继续扩大效益。因此，进一步治山治水治田和修好管好用好水利工程，争取农业稳产高产，仍是我国人民的一个长期的、艰巨的斗争任务。
