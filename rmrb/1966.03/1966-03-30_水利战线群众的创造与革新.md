    The Creativity and Innovation of the Masses on the Water Conservancy Front
    Many exhibits in the Water Conservancy Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center not only demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people in tenaciously transforming nature, but also showcase the wisdom and talent of the peasant masses in harnessing mountains, rivers, and fields. The following collection of materials fully proves the truth that "the people have unlimited creativity."

    Rafer Bang Levee
    Farmers in Chengcheng County, Shaanxi Province, creatively used the Rafer Bang Levee method to transform fragmented drylands into large-scale terraced fields that conserve water and soil. The Loess Plateau lacks stone, so stone embankments like those in Dazhai cannot be built. In the past, embankments were built by turning the soil with shovels and treading, which was inefficient and not very sturdy. Now, the masses have learned from the experience of building houses and walls, using a row of wooden rafters as a mold to build embankments along contour lines. This method of construction is fast and very durable. It is also effective in conserving water and soil. Using this simple and easy method, the people of Chengcheng have built 730,000 mu of terraced fields in just three years, more than the total area of land improved in the past thirteen years. At the same time, they have initially controlled 60 percent of the soil erosion area in the county.

    Splitting Ridge Soil
    The people of the Pi-Shi-Hang Irrigation Area on the northeastern edge of the Dabie Mountains and the Jianghuai Hills are vigorously developing canal systems, and the benefits are constantly expanding. The high ridges and steep slopes here are full of hard yellow clay, which the locals call "stone-like soil." Initially, digging canals on the ridges relied entirely on shovels, picks, and hoes. One blow of the hoe would only create a small pit, and not even half a shovel of soil could be dug out, making progress very slow. Later, the laborers created the "deep digging steep slope splitting method": Based on the terrain and the strength of the soil's viscosity, first dig a steep slope three meters long and two meters high on the ridge. Hollow out a seam at the foot of the slope and cut the ends deep to the bottom. Then, insert many sharpened hardwood stakes side by side into the steep ridge soil, and use wooden mallets or stone hammers to pound them until large cracks appear on the ground. At this time, people hold the wooden stakes, step on the cracks, and gather their strength to pull the stakes towards themselves, and a large piece of hard soil will fall down. Digging hard soil with this method is more than ten times more efficient than using shovels, picks, and hoes. Most of the more than 14,000 kilometers of main, branch, fighting, and farm supporting canals that have been dug in the Pi-Shi-Hang Irrigation Area have been dug using this method of digging hard clay.

    Fighting Shifting Sands
    The people of Cangzhou Prefecture, Hebei Province, worked hard throughout the winter and spring to dredge the 160-kilometer-long Xuanhui River, forming a water conservancy system that combines drainage, platforms, modification, irrigation, and afforestation, initially changing the low-yield, disaster-prone appearance of the areas along the river. The river is mostly shifting sand sections, and the most stubborn "enemy" the laborers encountered when digging this river was shifting sand. The fine sand that filled the riverbed "flies with the wind when dry and flows with the water when wet." The groundwater level is also high, so every shovel of sand dug out is immediately replaced by another. A three-meter-long bamboo pole cannot reach the hard soil layer when inserted into the mud and sand, and small carts cannot travel on the silt, and the sand slurry does not stick to the shovel. How to dig the river channel? The laborers brought their collective wisdom into play and found broken wooden boards and rotten branches, and laid wooden board roads and "branch ferries" on the riverbed to first remove the silt. After the silt was removed, the groundwater raised the shifting sand again, so the laborers used tubes made of branches to insert into the sand pits, creating well eyes to collect water. In this way, they drained water and dug sand at the same time, finally breaking through the shifting sand layer. Later, from using branches to make water collecting wells, many methods for fighting shifting sands, such as "rolling dragon ditch drainage" and "willow strip sand barriers," were developed. Using these "earth" methods, even the "Jinsha Ridge," which had never been conquered in the history of the Xuanhui River, was subdued by the laborers.

    Clever Design
    The people of Ganyu County, Jiangsu Province, which borders the Yellow Sea, have built a drainage and irrigation engineering system in the plains that "separates flood and drought, separates drainage and irrigation, separates high (water) and low (water), and separates salty (water) and fresh (water)," relying entirely on more than 30,000 culverts and bridges of various sizes. Many of these supporting projects were designed by "local experts." Liu Shanhua, a returned educated youth from the Black Forest Commune, took old farmers as his teachers, combined with the masses, and considered linking the originally separately constructed drainage culverts and irrigation culverts, designing a "three-story" small water conservancy hub that combines irrigation, drainage, and transportation. This three-combination small-scale project occupies less land, is easy to manage, saves labor and materials, and implements upper irrigation, lower drainage, and combined transportation, which is very popular among farmers.

    Spring Group River
    The Dandong Irrigation Area in Henan Province, located on the north bank of the Yellow River, originally only relied on diverting water from the surface Dan River for irrigation, and the benefited area was only 30,000 mu. Due to irrigation without drainage, the soil was salinized, and grain production was very low. Later, after years of observation by water management personnel and visits to old farmers, it was found that the irrigation area has flat terrain, high in the northwest and low in the southeast, and the groundwater level is very high, and the flow direction is consistent with the ground slope, so there is great potential for developing and utilizing groundwater. Therefore, they worked with the farmers to create a method of digging spring group rivers: In places with sufficient confined water head facing the groundwater flow direction, dozens of free-flowing spring wells are dug in a line, connected by water conveyance channels, and canal head gates are built in appropriate positions to concentrate the water volume, and then introduced into farmland for irrigation through diversion canals. They dig spring group rivers like this, and use groundwater and surface water jointly, ensuring that clear water flows continuously in the irrigation area. Not only has the irrigated area been expanded by more than 40,000 mu, but the groundwater level in the upstream area has also been greatly reduced, improving more than 60,000 mu of swampy saline-alkali land. Last year, the average grain yield in the entire irrigation area was 650 jin per mu, and the yield exceeded the "Yellow River."

### 水利战线群众的创造与革新

    水利战线群众的创造与革新
    全国农业展览馆水利馆的许多展品，不但显示了我国人民顽强改造大自然的革命精神，而且表现了农民群众治山治水治田的聪明才智。下面集纳的这些材料，充分证明了“人民群众有无限的创造力”这个真理。椽帮埝
    陕西省澄城县农民群众创造性地运用椽帮埝的治理方法，把支离破碎的旱原改造成蓄水保土的大面积水平埝地。黄土高原缺少石头，不能象大寨那样用石头垒地埝。过去靠锨翻脚踏培土修地埂，效率很低，还不结实。现在群众吸取民间盖房打墙的经验，用一排木椽子当模具，沿着地面等高线培修地埝，这样整修的速度快，很坚固耐久。蓄水保土，效果也好。澄城人民运用这种简单易行的办法，仅三年的时间，就修成水平埝地七十三万亩，比过去十三年整地的总面积还多，同时还使全县百分之六十的水土流失面积得到初步控制。劈岗土
    大别山东北麓、江淮丘陵的淠史杭灌区人民，大搞渠道配套，效益不断扩大。这里的高岗陡坡，尽是坚硬的黄泥礓土，当地群众称之为“赛石头”。开始在岗地上挖渠，全靠锨铲镐刨，一镐刨下去，一个小窝窝，挖不出半锨土，进度很慢。后来，民工们创造了“深挖陡坡劈土法”：根据地形和土质粘性强弱，先把岗地挖一个长三米、高二米的陡坡，坡脚掏一道缝，并把两头深切到底，然后用许多削尖了的硬木桩，并排地插入陡坡岗地上，再用木榔头或石锤等工具夯打，打到地面裂开大缝时，人们就手把木桩、脚登裂缝，叫齐了劲头，用力往怀里一扳木桩，一大片硬土就倒下去了。用这种方法挖硬土，比锨铲镐刨的效率提高十倍多。现在淠史杭灌区已挖成的总长一万四千多公里的干、支、斗、农配套渠道，大部分是用这种办法刨挖硬礓土的。战流沙
    河北省沧州专区人民，大干一冬春，疏浚了长达一百六十公里的宣惠河，形成了一个排、台、改、灌、林相结合的水利系统，初步改变了沿河两岸的低产多灾面貌。这条河绝大部分是流沙段，民工们在挖这条河时，遇到的最顽固的“敌人”就是流沙。淤满河床的细沙，“干了随风飘，湿了顺水流”，地下水位又高，挖一锨涨一锨。三米长的竹竿往泥沙里一插，竟摸不到硬土层，淤泥上走不得小车，沙泥浆不挂锨。河道怎么挖？民工们发挥集体智慧，找来碎木板、烂荆条，在河床上铺了木板道、“荆条渡”，首先把淤泥给清掉了。挖掉淤泥，地下水又把流沙抬上来了，民工们就用荆条编成的筒子插进沙窝，打成一眼一眼的集水井。这样一面排水，一面挖沙，终于突破了流沙层。后来，从用荆条打集水井，又发展到“滚龙沟排水”、“柳条排拦沙”等许多战流沙的方法，运用这些“土”办法，就连宣惠河历史上从未被征服的“金沙岭”，也叫民工们给治服了。巧设计
    濒临黄海的江苏省赣榆县人民，在平原地区建成的“洪涝分开、排灌分开、高（水）低（水）分开、咸（水）淡（水）分开”的排灌工程系统，完全靠着大小三万多座涵闸和桥梁控制。这些配套工程有很多是“土专家”设计的。黑林公社回乡知识青年刘善华，拜老农为师，同群众结合，把原来分开建筑的排水涵洞和灌溉涵洞联系起来考虑，设计出一种灌溉、排水、交通相结合的“三层楼”式小型水利枢纽。这种三结合的小型工程占地少，管理方便，省工省料，实行上灌、下排、结合交通，很受广大农民欢迎。泉组河
    位于黄河北岸的河南省丹东灌区，原来只靠引地面上丹河的水灌溉，受益面积只有三万亩，由于有灌无排，土质盐碱化，粮食产量很低。后来，经过管水人员多年观察和访问老农，发现灌区地势平坦，西北偏高，东南偏低，地下水位很高，并且流向和地面坡降一致，开发利用地下水，大有潜力，大有可为。于是，他们同农民一起创造了挖泉组河的办法：在迎着地下水流向有充足承压水头的地方，在一条线上深打几十眼自流井泉，用输水渠道连贯起来，并在适当的位置修建渠首闸，集中水量，再通过引水渠，引入农田灌溉。他们这样大挖泉组河，地下水与地面水联合运用，保证了灌区清水长流，不仅扩大了四万多亩的灌溉面积，还使上游地区的地下水位大大下降，改良了六万多亩沼泽盐碱地。去年全灌区平均亩产粮食六百五十斤，产量过了“黄河”。（附图片）
