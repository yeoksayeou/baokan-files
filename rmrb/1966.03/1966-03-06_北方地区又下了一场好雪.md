    Xinhua News Agency, 5th. A good snowfall has occurred again in the vast areas of northern China; some places even had rain.
    This snow and rain began at eight o'clock this morning and covered a relatively large area. Regions that experienced snowfall successively were Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, central Inner Mongolia, central and northern Shaanxi, Shandong, and western Liaoning; regions that experienced rainfall were southern Shaanxi and Henan Province. The heaviest snowfall occurred in northern Shaanxi, southern Inner Mongolia, northern Shanxi, Beijing, northern and central Hebei, and southern Shandong. Measurements taken at eight o'clock in the evening showed that precipitation in these areas generally ranged from five to ten millimeters, with some areas reaching ten to eighteen millimeters. The lightest snowfall was in western Liaoning, generally less than one millimeter. In other snowy areas, precipitation generally reached three to five millimeters. In rainy areas, central Henan received the most rain, with precipitation reaching ten to twenty-five millimeters.
    As of eight o'clock tonight, the above-mentioned snowfall and rainfall areas were slowly moving towards the south, but snowfall was still continuing in most areas.
    This snowfall and rainfall is another large-scale snowfall and rainfall following the relatively large-scale snowfall in the north from February 19th to 22nd. Relevant departments believe that this snow and rain is beneficial to the revival and growth of wheat and the sowing of spring crops. However, all regions must still pay attention to preventing spring drought. In particular, areas with less precipitation this time must pay more attention to drought prevention. In snowy areas, vigorous efforts should be made to organize snow accumulation and moisture conservation work immediately after the snow.

    北方地区又下了一场好雪
    新华社五日讯　我国北方广大地区又下了一场好雪；有些地方还下了雨。
    这场雪、雨从今天上午八时开始，下的范围较大。先后下雪的地区是北京、河北、山西、内蒙古中部、陕西中部北部、山东、辽宁西部；下雨的地区是陕西南部和河南省。下雪最大的地方为陕西北部、内蒙古南部、山西北部、北京、河北北部中部和山东南部，到晚上八时测量，这些地方降水量一般有五到十毫米，部分地区达十到十八毫米。下雪最小的地方是辽宁西部，一般不到一毫米。其他下雪的地方，降水量一般达三到五毫米。下雨的地方，以河南中部得雨较多，降水量达十到二十五毫米。
    上述的降雪、降雨区到今晚八时正缓慢向偏南方向移动，但大部地区降雪仍在继续。
    这次降雪、降雨，是继二月十九日到二十二日北方较大范围降雪之后，又一次大范围的降雪、雨。有关部门认为，这场雪、雨，对于小麦返青生长和春播作物播种都有好处。但各地仍须注意预防春旱。特别是这次降水量少的地区，更须重视防旱工作。得雪地区，雪后应即大力组织积雪保墒工作。
