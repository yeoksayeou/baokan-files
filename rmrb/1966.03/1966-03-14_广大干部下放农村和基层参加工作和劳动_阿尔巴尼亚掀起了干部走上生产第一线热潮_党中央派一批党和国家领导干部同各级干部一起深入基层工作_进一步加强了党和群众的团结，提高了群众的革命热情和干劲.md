    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 11th -- Our reporter reports that since January of this year, a large number of leading cadres and office staff in various parts of Albania have enthusiastically responded to the Party Central Committee's call to go deep into the grassroots, deep into production, and strengthen the frontline of production. They have volunteered to be transferred to rural areas and grassroots units for long-term work and participation in labor, demonstrating a high degree of political awareness and promoting the further development of production and construction and various revolutionary undertakings.

    This year marks the first year of Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan. Since the publication of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers' communiqué on October 25th last year regarding the participation of the entire people in the discussion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country has been unprecedentedly high. The measures taken by the Labor Party Central Committee to eliminate bureaucracy have been enthusiastically supported by cadres at all levels and the broad masses. They have actively responded to the Party's call and put forward many revolutionary initiatives. On January 18th, eleven agricultural experts from the Durrës District took the lead in volunteering to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and called on other agricultural experts to settle down in the countryside. This revolutionary initiative of theirs was immediately met with enthusiastic response and received strong support from the Labor Party Central Committee. On February 1st, the Labor Party Central Committee specifically made a decision to support the transfer of cadres to support industrial and agricultural production, pointing out that this action is a manifestation of the laborers' high political awareness and a manifestation of their healthy worldview.

    The Political Bureau of the Labor Party Central Committee then held a meeting on February 9th and decided to send twelve Party and state leading cadres, including Political Bureau members Manush Myftiu, Rita Marko, Gogo Nushi, Haki Toska, and Central Committee member and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Abdyl Këllezi, to go deep into the grassroots for long-term and continuous work. The Albanian Labor Party Central Committee instructed them to combine their strength with the revolutionary enthusiasm and determination of the working people and the Party cadres who went to the production posts, and to make efforts with their talents and abilities to further strengthen the work of the Party and the people's power.

    The above two decisions of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee further stimulated and enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad cadres. Under the leadership of leading cadres at all levels, a surge of cadres going to the grassroots and the frontline of production has formed. By the end of February, more than 7,000 people had volunteered to leave the cities to work in the grassroots and rural areas. Among them were cadres from Party and state organs, representatives of the People's Assembly, veteran guerrillas and officers of the People's Army, as well as doctors, technicians, literary and art workers, and young people determined to work in the countryside.

    A large number of transferred cadres, full of revolutionary passion for building a new socialist countryside and a fighting determination to vigorously develop grain production, have settled down in the countryside and become ordinary agricultural cooperative members and agricultural workers. Some have also gone to factories and mines. After arriving at the grassroots, they have gone deep into production and among the masses, appearing as ordinary laborers and playing an exemplary leading role in labor. They are simple in style and hard-working in life, and have become confidants of the masses.

    I. Dervishi, a senior officer of the People's Army who was transferred to the village of Brata in the Vlorë District, was a well-known military doctor during the National Liberation War and is now a famous doctor known to every household in the Brata mountainous area. Dervishi works day and night, often walking to nearby mountain villages late at night to treat farmers, and also participates in labor with farmers in his spare time. The local residents are filled with infinite love and gratitude for the doctor sent by the Party. At present, they are repaying the Party's care with selfless labor. The transferred cadre Zefi, with his exemplary role, influenced and motivated all members of the Talaqi Agricultural Cooperative in the Mirditë District, greatly increasing the attendance rate of the members.

    Ai Toçi, a representative of the People's Assembly and member of the District Party Committee who was transferred to the Korçë Brewery, on the one hand, takes on Party work, and on the other hand, goes deep into the workshop as an ordinary worker, working and talking with veteran workers. His humble, simple style and diligent spirit have won the enthusiastic praise of the workers.

    As a result of the large number of cadres being transferred to rural areas and grassroots and carrying out activities, the unity between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and drive of the masses have been greatly enhanced. The peasants said excitedly, "The Party has never forgotten us. The pulse of the Party and the pulse of the people always beat together. After the transferred cadres came to us, our strength has become greater, our confidence has become stronger, and our relationship with the Party has become closer." Under the exemplary actions of the transferred cadres, the elderly farmers of the village of Vuno in the Vlorë District automatically formed a "senior citizens production team" of more than a dozen people. After the arrival of the transferred cadres, the farmers in the Brata area immediately set higher production plans and vigorously developed grain production. Many farmers regard the transferred cadres as their family members, warmly welcoming them to live in their homes. Many farmers voluntarily give their houses and furniture to the transferred cadres and actively help them solve their living problems.

    广大干部下放农村和基层参加工作和劳动
    阿尔巴尼亚掀起了干部走上生产第一线热潮
    党中央派一批党和国家领导干部同各级干部一起深入基层工作
    进一步加强了党和群众的团结，提高了群众的革命热情和干劲
    新华社地拉那十一日电  本社记者报道，今年一月以来，阿尔巴尼亚各地的大批领导干部和机关工作人员，热烈响应劳动党中央关于深入基层、深入生产、加强生产第一线的战斗号召，志愿下放到农村和基层单位长期工作和参加劳动，表现了高度的政治觉悟，推动了生产建设和各项革命事业的进一步发展。
    今年，是阿尔巴尼亚开始执行第四个五年计划的第一年。去年十月二十五日阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议关于全民参加讨论第四个五年计划的文告发表以后，全国人民的革命热情空前高涨。劳动党中央为清除官僚主义而采取的措施，得到了各级干部和广大群众的热烈拥护。他们积极响应党的号召，纷纷提出了许多革命倡议。一月十八日，都拉斯区十一名农业专家首先志愿报名到农村去参加农业生产，并且号召其他农业专家也到农村安家落户。他们的这一革命倡议立即得到了热烈的响应，并得到劳动党中央的大力支持。劳动党中央在二月一日专门作出了关于支持干部下放支援工农业生产的决定，指出这一行动是劳动者高度的政治觉悟的表现，是他们健康的世界观的表现。
    劳动党中央政治局接着在二月九日召开会议，决定派政治局委员马·穆夫蒂乌、里·马尔科、果·努什、哈·托斯卡，中央委员、部长会议副主席阿·凯莱齐等十二个党和国家领导干部深入基层进行长期和连续不断的工作。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央指示他们，要把自己的力量同劳动人民和同前往生产岗位去的党的干部们的革命热情和决心汇合在一起，以自己的才干和能力为进一步加强党和人民政权的工作作出努力。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的上述两个决定，进一步激发和提高了广大干部的革命热情。在各级领导干部的带动下，形成了一个干部到基层和走上生产第一线的热潮。到二月下旬为止，自愿离开城市到基层和农村工作的已达到七千多人。他们当中有党和国家机关的干部，有人民议会代表，有老游击队员和人民军军官，也有医生、技术人员、文艺工作者和志在农村的青年。
    大批下放干部满怀建设社会主义新农村的革命激情和大搞粮食生产的战斗决心，到农村安家落户，成为普通的农业合作社员和农业工人。还有一部分人到了工厂和矿山。他们到基层以后，深入生产，深入群众，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，并且在劳动中起模范带头作用，他们作风俭朴，生活艰苦，成了群众的知心朋友。
    下放到发罗拉区布拉达村的人民军高级军官伊·德尔维什在民族解放战争时期曾经是一位著名的军医，现在已经是布拉达山区家喻户晓的名医了。德尔维什日以继夜地工作，不辞劳苦经常在深夜步行到附近的山村为农民治病，并且利用空闲时间同农民一起参加劳动。当地居民对党派来的医生充满了无限的热爱和感激，目前他们正以忘我的劳动来报答党的关怀。下放干部泽菲以自己的模范作用影响和带动了米尔迪塔区塔拉奇农业社的全体社员，使社员的劳动出勤率大大提高了。
    下放到科尔察啤酒厂的人民议会代表、区党委委员爱·托希一方面担任党的工作，一方面又以一个普通工人的身份深入车间，与老工人一块劳动、一块谈心。他的谦逊、朴实的作风和勤劳的精神赢得了工人们的热烈赞扬。
    由于大批干部下放到农村和基层并展开活动的结果，党和群众之间的团结进一步加强了，群众的革命热情和干劲大大提高了。农民们兴奋地说，“党一刻也没有忘记我们。党的脉搏和人民的脉搏始终在一起跳动。下放干部来到我们这里后，我们的力量更大了，信心更足了，我们和党的关系更密切了。”发罗拉区沃诺村的老年农民在下放干部的模范行动的带动下，自动组成了十几人的“老人生产队”。布拉达地区的农民在下放干部到达以后，立刻订出了更高的生产计划，大搞粮食生产。许多农民把下放干部当作自己的家里人，热情欢迎他们住到自己的家里。不少农民自愿把自己的房子和家具让给下放干部，主动帮助他们解决生活问题。
