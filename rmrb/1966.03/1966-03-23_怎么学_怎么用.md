    How to Learn, How to Use
    When studying Chairman Mao’s works, only by first using them to transform oneself can one effectively transform others; only by first practicing oneself can one better guide the practice of others.
    Comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu, there are significant gaps in my ideology, work, and style. These gaps are mainly due to the difference in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially the greatest difference lies in the word "use." In the "use" aspect, my effort is not as ruthless as his, my focus is not as accurate, my methods are not as flexible, and my results are not as good. My deepest experiences in this regard are as follows:
      (1) To creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, one must first transform oneself. Only by first transforming oneself can one effectively transform others. Comrade Jiao Yulu studied Chairman Mao's works primarily to transform himself, enabling himself to establish a communist worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. In the past, when I studied Chairman Mao's works, I used them more to educate others and less to transform myself; and in transforming myself, I transformed my thinking methods more and my ideological awareness less. (Correct thinking methods must be guided by a revolutionary worldview. It is difficult to achieve results by merely focusing on methods without first transforming one's worldview and strengthening the cultivation of ideological awareness – Editor.) I always thought that I had participated in the revolution for many years and that the problem of wholeheartedly serving the people had been solved, so I consciously or unconsciously relaxed my ideological transformation. The words "complacency," "fear," and "ego" often appeared in my thinking. Since 1959, our county has suffered severe natural disasters for three consecutive years. In 1963, production developed, and we became complacent. We were smug about the rapid recovery and the annual increase in double-cropping rice and green manure, and we were even happier about the encouragement from higher authorities and the praise from the masses. I always felt that the work was done almost well, and I was not sensitive to advanced things, afraid of taking risks, and one-sidedly sought stability, without demanding myself to a higher standard. Therefore, the complacent thought had not been overcome, and the burden of "rapid recovery" could not be shaken off. Because of this, the speed of agricultural production development has slowed down in the past two years. Our "complacency," "fear," and "ego" thoughts are the result of lacking Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. From this, it can be seen that to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, one must first transform oneself; and to transform oneself, one must first transform one's ideological awareness.
    (2) To creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, one must first use them to guide one's own practice. Thinking and speaking are not the same as doing. Only by first practicing oneself can one better guide the practice of others. Comrade Jiao Yulu, in transforming the objective world, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide his own practice, setting a good example for us to learn from. He not only made the ambitious goal of working hard for three to five years to change the face of Lankao, and not resting in peace until the goal was achieved, but more importantly, he had a spirit of seeking truth from facts and the most practical work. Thorough and systematic investigation and research enabled him to propose a realistic plan to change the face of Lankao. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, we lack his spirit of doing solid work and doing it ourselves. That is to say, in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the transformation of the objective world, we talk more and do less; we educate others more and do less ourselves. I have been in Taoyuan for several years, and although I have also visited many places, I lack Comrade Jiao Yulu's working style of conducting investigation and research personally and grasping first-hand materials. We have not seriously, systematically, and meticulously examined a mountain or a river, so we cannot come up with a blueprint to change the face of nature. Thus, in guiding the overall situation, there is only a general framework, lacking specific measures and good examples. Despite having ideals, despite constantly educating cadres and the masses to establish lofty aspirations, we have not achieved significant results.
      (3) To creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the important thing is to relate to one's own ideological reality. Living in the homes of the masses is not the same as closely connecting with the masses. The key lies in whether one has deep class feelings, whether one can share the same fate and breathe the same air with the masses, and whether one can mobilize the masses to rise up themselves to fight for the realization of their fundamental interests. The masses praised Jiao Yulu, saying: his heart is close to the masses, the hearts of the masses are close to him, and he and the masses are of one mind. Although I also constantly ran down to the grassroots in the past, and after participating in the socialist education movement, I also lived, ate, and worked with the masses, I thought that this meant closely connecting with the masses. Now, comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel very inadequate. To closely connect with the masses, one must first believe in the masses like Jiao Yulu, and according to the demands and fundamental interests of the masses, educate, enlighten, and lead the masses to rise up themselves to liberate themselves and fight for the realization of their fundamental interests. To do this, we must constantly improve our style, not only from the form, but more importantly, from the ideology, and from the class feelings.
    In short, to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must first learn his "use" skill in studying Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our own thinking, guide our own practice, and improve our own style.

    怎么学  怎么用
    学习毛主席著作，只有首先用来改造自己，才能有效地改造别人；只有首先自己实践，才能更好地指导别人实践。
    我与焦裕禄同志比较，在思想、工作和作风上，都有很大的差距。这些差距，主要是活学活用毛主席著作的差距，特别是在“用”字上差距最大。在“用”字上，功夫不如他狠，重点不如他准，方法不如他活，效果不如他好。在这方面，我最深刻的体会有以下三点：
      （一）活学活用毛主席著作，首先要改造自己。只有首先改造自己，才能有效地改造别人。焦裕禄同志学习毛主席著作，首先是用来改造自己，使自己树立了完全彻底为人民服务的共产主义世界观。我过去学习毛主席著作，用来教育别人多，改造自己少；在改造自己中，又是改造思想方法多，改造思想意识少。（正确的思想方法，要有革命的世界观作指导。不首先改造世界观，加强思想意识的修养，而单纯从方法上下功夫，那是难于奏效的——编者。）总认为自己参加革命多年，全心全意为人民服务的世界观问题解决了，自觉不自觉地放松了对自己的思想改造。在思想上也就常出现“满”“怕”“我”三个字。一九五九年以来，我县连续三年遭受严重的自然灾害。一九六三年生产有了发展，我们便产生了骄傲自满思想。对于恢复快，双季稻、绿肥年年增产而沾沾自喜，对于来自上级的鼓励和群众的称赞，更是内心高兴。总认为工作做得差不多，对先进事物不敏感，怕冒风险，片面求稳，没有以更高的标准要求自己。因此，骄傲自满的思想一直没有得到克服，“恢复快”的包袱老是丢不掉。正因为这样，这两年农业生产发展的速度就慢下来了。我们这种“满”“怕”“我”的思想，正是缺乏焦裕禄同志那种完全彻底为人民服务精神的结果。由此看来，活学活用毛主席著作，必须首先改造自己；而改造自己，又必须首先改造自己的思想意识。
    （二）活学活用毛主席著作，首先要用于指导自己的实践。自己想到讲到不等于自己做到。只有首先自己实践，才能更好地指导别人实践。焦裕禄同志在改造客观世界中，用毛泽东思想指导自己的实践，给我们树立了一个学习的好样板。他不仅立下了苦战三五年，改变兰考面貌，不达目的，死不瞑目的雄心壮志，更重要的是有实事求是的精神和最切实的实际工作。艰苦系统的调查研究，使他能够提出改变兰考面貌的切合实际的规划。同焦裕禄同志比较，我们就缺乏他这种扎扎实实干、亲自动手干的精神。也就是说，在用毛泽东思想指导改造客观世界上，讲的多、做的不够；教育别人多，自己亲自动手做的不够。我来桃源几年，虽然也跑了不少地方，但是缺乏焦裕禄同志那种亲自做调查研究、掌握第一手材料的工作作风，我们没有认真地、系统地、细致地考查一个山头、一条河流，所以拿不出改变自然面貌的蓝图。这样，在指导全面上，便只有一个大框框，缺少具体措施和好的样板。尽管有理想，尽管经常地教育干部群众树雄心立壮志，但是一直没有取得显著的效果。
      （三）活学活用毛主席著作，重要的是联系自己的思想实际。住在群众家里不等于密切联系了群众，关键在于有没有深厚的阶级感情，能不能和群众同命运、共呼吸，能不能发动群众自己起来为实现自己的根本利益而斗争。群众赞扬焦裕禄说：他的心贴着群众，群众的心贴着他，他和群众是一个心思。我过去虽然也不断在下面跑，参加社会主义教育运动以后，也做到与群众同吃同住同劳动，自认为这样也就是密切联系群众了。现在与焦裕禄同志比较，感到很不够。密切联系群众，首先要象焦裕禄一样相信群众，要根据群众的要求和根本利益，教育、启发和带动群众自己起来解放自己，为实现自己的根本利益而斗争。要这样，就必须不断改进作风，不仅从形式上改，更重要的是从思想上改，从阶级感情上改。
    总之，向焦裕禄同志学习，首先要学习他在学习毛主席著作中的“用”字功夫，用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，指导自己的实践，改进自己的作风。
