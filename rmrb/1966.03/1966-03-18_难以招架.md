	De Gaulle checkmated the United States, giving Johnson a big headache and making it difficult for him to cope. The United States attempted to rally the other member states of the North Atlantic Group to exert pressure on France. However, it convened two meetings but failed to produce a so-called "joint declaration," and further exposed the numerous contradictions between the United States and its other "allies," further proving that the United States' hegemony in the West is indeed declining.
	In fact, this is not surprising. The reason why France dares to openly challenge the hegemony of the United States is precisely because the balance of power within the imperialist camp has changed to the disadvantage of the United States. Getting rid of American control is not only France's demand, but also the demand of many other Western European countries. Therefore, how can the United States expect its other "allies" to listen to its dispatch as they did in the past? Johnson simply has too little self-awareness.
	Moreover, even if the United States can rely on pressure to barely produce a "joint declaration," what use can it be? Does Johnson think that this will scare De Gaulle into obediently continuing to prostrate himself at the feet of the American leader? I am afraid that the United States' playing such a card will only force its opponent to reveal its cards faster.

    难以招架
    戴高乐将了美国一军，这使得约翰逊大伤脑筋，难以应付。美国企图纠集北大西洋集团的其他成员国一起来对法国施加压力。但是，它召集了两次会议，都没有能把一个所谓“联合宣言”炮制出来，而且进一步暴露了美国和其他“盟国”之间的重重矛盾，更加证明美国在西方的霸权的确日薄西山了。
    其实，这是毫不奇怪的。法国之所以敢于公开向美国的霸权挑战，正是因为在帝国主义阵营内部力量对比发生了不利于美国的变化。摆脱美国控制，不仅是法国的要求，同样也是其他许多西欧国家的要求，因此，美国又怎么能期望其他的“盟国”还和过去一样听它支遣呢？约翰逊简直是太无自知之明了。
    况且，即使美国能够依靠压力，勉强搞出一个“联合宣言”来，又能顶什么用呢？难道约翰逊认为这一下子就能够把戴高乐吓住，乖乖地继续匍伏在美国盟主脚下吗？恐怕美国打出这样一张牌来，只会逼得它的对手更快地摊牌罢了。
