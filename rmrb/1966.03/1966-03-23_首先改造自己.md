    First Remold Oneself
    We are all studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. How are we applying them? Are we hitting the nail on the head? This is worth studying carefully. Comrade Yang Huiquan said that the reason why his results in studying Chairman Mao's works in the past were not as good as those of Comrade Jiao Yulu was mainly because: he used them more to remold others and less to remold himself; he used them more to remold working methods and less to remold ideological consciousness; he guided others' practice more and personally engaged in practice less. Many other county committee comrades have also written letters discussing similar situations. This shows that, in order to achieve the practical effect of transforming the objective world, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, through the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, we must first use them to transform our own subjective world, that is, start with the transformation of our own thinking.
    The comrades of the county committee are educating the people and organizing the people to engage in revolutionary practice every day. Being in this position of educating and leading people, if they lack awareness, they can easily neglect their own ideological transformation. Aren't there quite a few comrades who say this:
  “I have been in the revolution for half my life, what problems could there be with my worldview!”
  “I am busy all day long, isn't it all for the people!” Due to the existence of such thoughts, the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is naturally not applied to oneself; or only attention is paid to learning working methods, and not to transforming the world outlook.
    Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are science. The purpose of studying them lies entirely in application, not for the sake of studying. We must put great effort into the word "use," and first use it to transform our own thinking and practice.
    Objective things are constantly developing and changing, and no one's ideological transformation can be "once and for all." Comrade Mao Zedong said that it is most difficult for a person to consistently benefit the broad masses, consistently benefit the revolution, and work hard for decades as if it were one day. What makes it difficult? It is difficult to maintain the youth of a revolutionary forever, to share the same fate and breathe the same air with the broad masses of the people forever; it is difficult to make one's own thinking and actions always keep up with the development of objective things. Ideological transformation is long-term and arduous; one must transform oneself throughout one's revolutionary life.

### 首先改造自己

    首先改造自己
    我们都在活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，怎样用？是不是用到了点子上？值得很好研究。杨汇泉同志说，他过去学习毛泽东同志的著作，效果所以不如焦裕禄同志，主要原因是：用来改造别人多，改造自己少；改造工作方法多，改造思想意识少；指导别人实践多，自己亲身实践少。还有不少县委同志来信，也谈到类似的情况。这说明，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，要想象焦裕禄同志那样，收到改造客观世界的实效，首先要用来改造自己的主观世界，即从自己的思想改造入手。
    县委的同志，天天都在教育人民群众，组织人民群众从事革命实践。处于这种教育人、领导人的地位，如果缺乏自觉，就容易忽视自己的思想改造。不是有不少同志这样说么：
  “革命半辈子了，世界观还会有什么问题！”
  “整天忙忙碌碌，还不是为的人民！”由于存在着诸如此类的思想，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，自然用不到自己身上；或者只注意学习工作方法，不注意改造世界观。
    马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想是科学。学习它的目的，全在于应用，决不是为学习而学习。我们必须在用字上狠下功夫，并且首先用于改造自己的思想和实践。
    客观事物是不断发展变化的，任何人的思想改造，都不可能“一劳永逸”。毛泽东同志说过，一个人，一贯地有益于广大群众，一贯地有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，是最难的。难在什么地方？就难在永葆革命者的青春，永远同广大人民群众同命运共呼吸；难在使自己的思想和行动永远跟得上客观事物的发展。思想改造是长期的、艰苦的，革命一辈子，就要改造一辈子。
