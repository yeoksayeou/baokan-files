	“Playing the Hero”
	Today, this column publishes articles written by several county committee comrades from areas with good natural conditions and relatively advanced work. In the process of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, they have raised some thought-provoking questions in light of the specific conditions of their regions.
	Good natural conditions and many favorable factors are inherently good things for socialist revolution and construction. However, if one falls into blindness towards them, it is difficult to fully leverage the positive effects of good conditions. Consider this: Yixing County has not been able to afforest and green its 300,000 mu of barren hills in a planned way; Xuancheng County in the Jianghuai Plain is content with the gradual improvement of people's lives and its work is not progressing quickly; Qidong County, due to years of high yields and improved living standards, some people once only sought stable production and neglected continuous revolution. No place can afford complacency. In areas with successful work and good natural conditions, it is even more necessary to strive to give full play to human agency on the basis of superior objective conditions, and to promote the continuous advancement of work. If good conditions are carried as a "burden", one will stagnate.
	Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "Revolutionaries should play the hero in the face of difficulties." Revolutionaries should be even more capable of playing the hero under good conditions. Because when conditions are good, as long as we can carry forward the Party's three major work styles and maintain closer ties with the masses, we can lead the masses to do many things that should be done, better and faster. To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we should identify shortcomings, make resolutions, demand high standards of ourselves, view things with a developmental perspective, stand tall, see far, and truly have the motherland in our hearts and the world in our sights, and build a new socialist countryside.
	Work is struggle. Whether in difficulty or in smooth progress, life is testing every revolutionary. May our county committee leading comrades, no matter what the conditions, be thorough revolutionaries, guide situations according to their inherent nature, and firmly lead the people of the whole county to carry the revolution through to the end.

### “逞英雄”

    “逞英雄”
    今天本栏刊登了几位自然条件好的和工作比较先进地区的县委同志写的文章。他们在学习焦裕禄同志的过程中，结合本地区的情况，提出了一些发人深思的问题。
    自然条件好，有利因素多，这对社会主义革命和建设来说，本来是好事情。但是，如果对它陷入盲目性，就难于充分发挥好条件的积极作用。请看：宜兴县的三十万亩荒山没有能够有计划地造林绿化；江淮平原上的宣城县，满足于人民生活已经逐年改善，工作进展不快；启东县因连年高产，日子好了，有些人曾一度只求稳产，忽视不断革命。任何地方，都不能有自满情绪。在工作有成绩、自然条件好的地区，更要努力在优越的客观条件的基础上，充分发挥人的能动性，推动工作的不断前进。如果把好条件当作“包袱”背起来，就会停滞不前。
    焦裕禄同志说：“革命者应在困难面前逞英雄。”在好的条件下革命者应该更能逞英雄。因为条件好，只要能够发扬党的三大作风，更加紧密地联系群众，就能够领导群众，把许多该办的事，办得更好些、更快些。学习焦裕禄同志，应该找差距，下决心，以高标准要求自己，用发展的眼光看待事物，站得高，看得远，真正胸怀祖国、放眼世界，建设社会主义的新农村。
    工作就是斗争。无论在困难之中，还是在顺利之中，生活都在考验每一个革命者。愿我们的县委领导同志，不论在什么样的条件下，都要做一个彻底的革命者，因势利导，坚定地领导全县人民将革命进行到底。
