	Humphrey's Delirium
	Lin Ping

	U.S. Vice President Humphrey suddenly spoke at length on the "friendship" with the Chinese people on the 12th. Among the recent war threats and aggressive clamors constantly issued by American military and political leaders against the Chinese people, this unusual tone seems quite out of harmony.

	Humphrey expressed his "brilliant views" from two aspects. First, he said: "Among the Chinese people, there is still a great deal of friendship toward us"; second, he said: "We must seize every opportunity to express our friendliness to the Chinese people." With give and take, rather than wishful thinking, Humphrey spoke quite thoughtfully. But, unfortunately, even if delirium comes from the mouth of the U.S. Vice President, it can only remain delirium.

	There is no doubt that there is a great friendship between the Chinese people and the American people. Chairman Mao Zedong has long said: "The Chinese people understand that American imperialism has done many bad things to China and many bad things to the whole world. It is only the ruling group of the United States that is not good; the American people are very good." He also said: "The people of the world, including the American people, are our friends." As for U.S. imperialism, it is the Chinese people's irreconcilable enemy, and also the enemy of the American people. The Chinese people have only strong hatred for it. It is none other than the likes of Johnson and Humphrey who are constantly deepening the Chinese people's hatred for U.S. imperialism. Now, the American people are rising up to oppose their own country's imperialism. The friendship between the Chinese and American people will increasingly develop in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. This is precisely what these U.S. imperialist bosses are most worried about and yet helpless against.

	Humphrey's so-called desire to "seize every opportunity" to express "friendliness" to the Chinese people is also quite unnecessary. The Chinese people have already learned enough about the "friendliness" of U.S. imperialism. If Humphrey thinks that the Chinese people are forgetful and will forget what U.S. imperialism has done to us over the past hundred years, then isn't U.S. imperialism still expressing this "traditional" "friendliness" to the Chinese people? It still occupies our territory of Taiwan, it constantly sends aircraft and warships to violate our airspace and territorial waters, it spares no effort to establish a crescent-shaped military encirclement around our country, pointing the spear of aggression at the Chinese people, and it is also preparing to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to China. Is there anything more expressive of U.S. imperialism's "friendliness" to the Chinese people than these actions? Humphrey's "Judas-like kiss" can only arouse the Chinese people's disgust and make us increase our vigilance a hundredfold.

	In fact, Humphrey's set is not a new creation. People remember that sixteen years ago, when U.S. Secretary of State Acheson published the "White Paper" on China, he also played this trick of extravagantly talking about "Sino-American friendship." It seems that although nearly a sixth of a century has passed, the American rulers have not learned to be any smarter. At this time when 650 million people in China are united as never before under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, Humphrey actually uses the ostrich's ability to dream of finding loopholes among the Chinese people, which can only show that he is a hundred times more incompetent than Acheson.

	Humphrey only said one true thing in his speech: "We know too little about Asia." The problem is that reactionaries like Humphrey can never truly understand today's Asia, today's China. This is why they are doomed to misfortune.

    汉弗莱的梦呓
    林平
    美国副总统汉弗莱十二日忽然大谈起同中国人民的“友谊”来。在最近美国军政头目们对中国人民不断发出战争威胁和侵略叫嚣声中，这种异乎寻常的论调，未免太不调和了。
    汉弗莱从两方面来发表他的“高见”。第一、他说：“在中国人民中间，对我们仍然有很大的友谊”；第二、他说：“我们必须利用一切机会向中国人民表示我们的友好。”有来有往，而不是一厢情愿，汉弗莱说得相当周到。但是，可惜梦呓即使出自美国副总统之口，也仍然只能是梦呓。
    中国人民同美国人民之间存在着很大的友谊，这是毫无疑问的。毛泽东主席早就说过：“中国人民懂得，美国帝国主义对中国做了许多坏事，对全世界做了许多坏事，只是美国的统治集团不好，美国人民是很好的。”他又说过：“全世界人民包括美国人民都是我们的朋友。”至于美帝国主义，那是中国人民不共戴天的死敌，也是美国人民的死敌。中国人民对它只有强烈的仇恨。不是别人，正是约翰逊、汉弗莱之流不断在加深中国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨。现在，美国人民正在起来反对本国的帝国主义。中美人民的友谊，将在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中日益发展。这正是汉弗莱这些美帝国主义头子们所最担心而又无可奈何的。
    汉弗莱所谓要“利用一切机会”向中国人民表示“友好”，那也就大可不必了。对于美帝国主义的“友好”，中国人民已经领教得够多了。汉弗莱如果认为中国人民善忘，会把过去一百多年美帝国主义对我们的所作所为忘怀的话，那么美帝国主义目前不是仍在对中国人民表示它的这种“传统”的“友好”吗？它至今霸占着我国的领土台湾，它不断地派遣飞机、军舰侵犯我国领空领海，它在我国的周围不遗余力地建立一个新月形的军事包围圈，把侵略矛头指向中国人民，他还准备把侵越战争扩大到中国来。难道还有什么比这些行动更能表达美帝国主义对中国人民的“友好”的吗？汉弗莱这种“犹大式的亲吻”，只能引起中国人民的厌恶，并使我们百倍提高警惕。
    其实，汉弗莱的这一套，也并不是什么新创造。人们记得，十六年前，美国国务卿艾奇逊在发表关于中国问题的“白皮书”的时候，就曾经耍过这种侈谈“中美友谊”的伎俩。看来，虽然已经过了将近六分之一个世纪，美国统治者丝毫没有学得聪明点。在今天六亿五千万人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导下空前未有地团结一致的这个时候，汉弗莱竟然使出鸵鸟的本领，梦想在中国人民中间找空子，这只能表明他比起艾奇逊来还要低能百倍。
    汉弗莱在他的演说中只说了一句真话：“我们对亚洲懂得太少了”。问题是象汉弗莱这样的反动派，永远也不可能真正懂得今天的亚洲，今天的中国。这就是为什么他们注定要倒霉的原故。
