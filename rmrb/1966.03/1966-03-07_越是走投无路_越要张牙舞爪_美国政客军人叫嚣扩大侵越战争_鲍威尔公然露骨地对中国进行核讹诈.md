    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th) As U.S. President Johnson and Defense Secretary McNamara and others have recently been continuously clamoring for further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, some American military figures are also cheering and advocating for more military measures to "exert pressure" on the Vietnamese people. However, these war cries of bared fangs and brandished claws cannot scare anyone, but instead increase the concern and opposition of some American congressmen to the consequences of Johnson's further expansion of the war.
    The White House issued a report on the 5th by Vice President Humphrey regarding his trip to the Far East. This report admits that the United States is facing a "long and costly struggle" in South Vietnam. The report declared that the United States would fight to the end in South Vietnam to prevent the South Vietnamese people from achieving victory. According to American news agencies, U.S. President Johnson also received Williamson, the commander of the 173rd Airborne Brigade of the U.S. forces invading Vietnam, on the same day, and discussed the situation in South Vietnam with him. After the meeting, Williamson told reporters that it was necessary to "continue to exert pressure" on the Vietnamese people, and said that he "definitely" believed that the United States should lay mines in the port of Haiphong "to prevent people from using it."
    Taylor, U.S. presidential advisor and former "ambassador" to South Vietnam, also advocated on the 5th to block the port of Haiphong in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by means of laying mines. When testifying on February 17th, Taylor also said that the reason he advocated laying mines was because this "would avoid some international problems that would be caused if a naval blockade were implemented." Taylor also insisted on strengthening the bombing of North Vietnam. He said that he believed that the United States should "increase the number of times we bomb and the targets we attack."
    Powell, the former commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, advocated on the 4th for "bombing the port of Haiphong." He also blatantly engaged in nuclear blackmail against China, saying that the United States "should make it very clear that if Communist China participates in the war, we (the United States) will use nuclear weapons."
    The U.S. government's conspiracy to further expand the war is causing anxiety among some senators, even though they share the same goal as the Johnson administration of occupying South Vietnam. Senate Democratic Leader Mansfield said on the 5th that he opposed laying mines or bombing Haiphong, because he feared that this would greatly expand the conflict in Southeast Asia before the United States was ready.
    Senator Morse warned on the evening of the 4th that further expansion of the war would plunge the United States into the quagmire of "fighting a fifty-year war in Asia." Morse said, "Month after month, escalation after escalation, the United States is now increasingly falling into the bottomless abyss of fighting a ground war in Asia," and there is a risk of fighting with China. Morse also said that the U.S. policy towards Vietnam was "shockingly immoral." He said that China was not carrying out aggression there; there, "we (the United States) are the aggressors." He was worried that in the coming years, the Democratic Party would suffer serious setbacks in elections due to the war of aggression against Vietnam. (Attached picture)

### 越是走投无路　越要张牙舞爪  美国政客军人叫嚣扩大侵越战争  鲍威尔公然露骨地对中国进行核讹诈

    越是走投无路　越要张牙舞爪
    美国政客军人叫嚣扩大侵越战争
    鲍威尔公然露骨地对中国进行核讹诈
    据新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统约翰逊和国防部长麦克纳马拉之流近日来连续发出要进一步扩大侵越战争的叫嚷的时候，美国一些军人也正在摇旗呐喊，鼓吹采取更多的军事措施来对越南人民“施加压力”。但是这些张牙舞爪的战争叫嚣吓不倒什么人，却是增加了美国一些议员对约翰逊进一步扩大战争的后果的忧虑和反对。
    白宫五日发表了副总统汉弗莱关于远东之行的一个报告。这个报告承认，美国在南越正面临一个“漫长的代价高昂的斗争”。报告扬言美国要在南越打到底，阻止南越人民取得胜利。据美国通讯社报道，美国总统约翰逊这一天还接见了侵越美军第一百七十三空降旅旅长威廉森，同他讨论南越局势。威廉森在会见后对记者发表谈话时强调要对越南人民“继续施加压力”，并说，他“肯定地”认为，美国应当在海防港口布雷，“不让人们使用它”。
    美国总统顾问、前驻南越“大使”泰勒五日也鼓吹通过布雷的办法来封锁越南民主共和国的海防港。泰勒在二月十七日作证时还曾经说，他所以主张布雷，是因为这“将会避免如果实行海军封锁将引起的一些国际问题”。泰勒还坚持加强对越南北方的轰炸。他说，他认为美国应当“增加我们（轰炸的）次数和攻击的目标。”
    前美国战略空军司令部司令鲍威尔四日主张“轰炸海防港”。他还露骨地对中国进行核讹诈，说什么美国“应该十分清楚地表明，如果共产党中国参加战争，我们（美国）将使用核武器”。
    美国政府进一步扩大战争的阴谋正在引起一些参议员的不安，尽管他们同约翰逊政府霸占南越的目的是相同的。参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德五日表示，他反对在海防布雷或轰炸海防，因为他担心这会在美国还没有作好准备的时候就大大扩大在东南亚的冲突。
    参议员莫尔斯四日晚上警告说，进一步扩大战争将使美国陷入“在亚洲打一场五十年战争”的泥沼中。莫尔斯说，“一月又一月，一次又一次升级，美国现在正在日益陷入在亚洲打地面战争的无底深渊中”，并且存在同中国作战的风险。莫尔斯还说美国对越南的政策是“惊人地不道德的”。他说，中国并没有在那里进行侵略，在那里，“我们（美国）是侵略者”。他担心在今后一些年里，民主党将由于侵越战争在选举中遭到严重的挫折。（附图片）
