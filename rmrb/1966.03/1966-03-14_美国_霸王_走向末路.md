    The history books are full of examples of ambitious individuals who tried to become overlords but ended up defeated and in ruins. Such were the fates of Napoleon and Hitler. Now, American imperialism is following the same path.
    Since the end of the war, American imperialism has been arrogantly trying to act as the overlord of the world. The counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism is to establish a slave system worldwide, with itself as the twentieth-century slave owner. American imperialism not only wants to overthrow and subvert socialist countries and seize vast regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but it also does not let its so-called "allies" off lightly. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "American imperialism even implements a 'survival of the fittest' policy towards its allies in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania, trying to trample them under its feet."
    In the early post-war period, American imperialism relied on its dominant position in the capitalist world and exploited the weakened state of Western European countries due to the war. Through "economic aid," assembling military blocs, and other means, it placed its "allies" under its control, issuing orders and bossing them around. The "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" is a major tool for the United States to control Western European countries. And these allies, at that time, had to rely on the United States, so they had to swallow their anger and accept the position of junior partners. At that time, American imperialism truly had the air of an "overlord," extremely smug.
    However, the relationship between the United States and Western European countries is full of complex contradictions. The United States wants to strengthen its control, while Western European countries want to break free from that control. This struggle is becoming increasingly fierce. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that the imperialist bloc is accelerating towards disintegration.
    Lenin said, "Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism." After Western European countries recovered their strength and revitalized their economies, how could they willingly let the United States ride on their backs?
    Recently, French President de Gaulle's proposal to take command of the 30,000 American troops and military bases stationed in France is a prominent example of the changing status between the United States and its "allies." The large-scale arms race of the United States after the war affected technological innovation in the civilian economy. On the other hand, France has vigorously updated equipment in the industrial and agricultural sectors, increasing its competitiveness in foreign markets. The United States reached its hands out far and wide, trying to seize the entire world, and as a result, it put countless nooses around its own neck, especially getting deeply mired in the quagmire of South Vietnam, running around in a panic. On the other hand, France has extricated itself from the quagmires of the war of aggression against Indochina and the war of aggression against Algeria. Thus, in Sino-French relations, it is no longer France that is seeking help from the United States, but the United States that is seeking help from France; France has taken the initiative, and the United States has become passive. It is only natural that France does not take the United States' side. This situation will continue to develop.
    The "overlord" dream of American imperialism is moving towards disillusionment. Its policy of establishing world hegemony not only encounters the resistance of the revolutionary people of the world, especially the oppressed nations and oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also encounters the resistance of all countries that are subjected to its aggression, control, interference, and bullying. At present, American imperialism is losing support and is unprecedentedly isolated. American imperialism, which vainly attempts to act as a global overlord, will one day be surrounded by the world and end up in ruin.

    美国“霸王”走向末路
    何卓
    野心勃勃要充当霸王，结果落得一败涂地的，在历史上不乏先例。拿破仑、希特勒的下场，都是如此。现在，美帝国主义也正在沿着同样的道路走下去。
    战后以来，美帝国主义狂妄地要充当全世界的霸王。美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，就是要在全世界建立起奴隶制度，由它来充当二十世纪的奴隶主。美帝国主义不仅要推翻和颠覆社会主义国家，囊括亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大地区，而且对自己的所谓“盟国”，也不轻轻放过。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“美帝国主义甚至对它在西欧、北美和大洋洲的盟国，也实行‘弱肉强食’的政策，力图把它们踩在自己的脚下。”
    战后初期，美帝国主义依仗着它在资本主义世界的优势地位，利用西欧国家在战争中力量严重削弱的情况，通过“经济援助”、拼凑军事集团等手段，把它的“盟国”置于自己的控制之下，对它们发号施令、颐指气使。“北大西洋公约组织”，就是美国控制西欧国家的一个主要工具。而这些盟国当时也有求于美国，只好忍气吞声，屈居于小伙计的地位。那个时候，美帝国主义真是一副“霸王”气概，神气极了。
    但是，在美国同西欧国家的关系上，充满着错综复杂的矛盾。美国要加强控制，西欧国家要摆脱控制，这一斗争一天比一天激烈。毛泽东同志早就指出：帝国主义集团正在加速走向四分五裂。
    列宁说过，“经济政治发展的不平衡是资本主义的绝对规律”。当西欧国家在恢复了元气、重振了实力之后，它们怎么还会甘心被美国骑在自己的脖子上呢？
    最近，法国总统戴高乐提出要管辖美国驻在法国的三万军队和军事基地，正是美国和它“盟国”之间的地位发生改变的一个突出的例子。美国在战后进行大规模的扩军备战，影响了在民用经济方面的技术改革；而法国则在工业和农业部门中大力进行设备更新，提高了它在国外市场上的竞争能力。美国把手伸得长长的，想把全世界攫为己有，结果是给自己套上了无数的绞索，特别是深陷在南越这个泥沼之中，狼狈周章；而法国则先后从侵略印度支那战争和侵略阿尔及利亚战争这两个泥坑脱身出来。这样，在美法关系上，不再是法国有求于美国了，而是美国有求于法国了；法国主动了，美国被动了。法国不买美国的账，这是理所当然的。这种局势还会继续发展。
    美帝国主义的“霸王”梦正在走向幻灭。它建立世界霸权的政策，不仅遇到了全世界革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国被压迫民族和被压迫人民的反抗，而且也要遇到所有受它侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家的反抗。目前，美帝国主义已经众叛亲离，空前孤立。妄想充当全球霸主的美帝国主义，终有一天会陷于“天下之围”，落得一个覆灭的下场。
