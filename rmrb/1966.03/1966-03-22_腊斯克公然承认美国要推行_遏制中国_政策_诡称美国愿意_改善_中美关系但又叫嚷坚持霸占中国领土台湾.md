    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 21st dispatch: In a television interview on the 20th, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk went to great lengths to defend the U.S. government's policies of aggression and hostility toward China. However, his defense itself proves once again that the Johnson administration is adhering precisely to these policies.
    Because broad sections of the American public are worried that the continuous "escalation" of the war of aggression in Vietnam will lead to a "head-on collision with China," a major debate on China policy has recently unfolded in the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, and in public opinion, following the great debate on Vietnam policy. It was in this context that Rusk had to come out to offer a sophistical defense of the American policy of hostility toward China.
    In his remarks, Rusk slandered China as "belligerent" and carrying out "seizures" externally. He said that China keeps Asia in a state of "tension," wants to "seize South Vietnam through Hanoi," and that there is "no sign that Beijing will become a loyal and peaceful member of the world family." He even picked up the anti-China slanders of the Khrushchev revisionists as the basis for his attack on China, saying that "even in the communist world, China's belligerence has become a source of unrest."
    The U.S. Secretary of State emphasized that the United States must continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and persist in its aggression against Vietnam. On the one hand, he said that the United States is willing to "improve" relations with China, but on the other hand, he said that China has responded to all proposals on this issue by asking, "Are you (the United States) prepared to hand over Formosa (i.e., Taiwan)?" Rusk said that the U.S. response to this question is: "No, we are not prepared to do so," "not prepared to hand over the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan)." He said that in the one hundred and twenty-nine ambassadorial-level talks that have taken place between China and the United States, whenever China proposes that the United States return China's territory of Taiwan, "the talks become very difficult because the United States will never accept this." He also said, "We also cannot agree to their activities of seizing South Vietnam through Hanoi."
    While reiterating that the United States persists in its policy of aggression against China, Rusk spoke at length about the United States' willingness to hold "unconditional talks" with China on Southeast Asia and other issues, and said that if communist China expresses its willingness to go to the negotiating table, "I will go to Geneva tomorrow afternoon." He also said that the United States adopts a "flexible policy" toward China, and the United States keeps "the door open to establishing peaceful relations" with China. He also trotted out Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and other heads of American imperialism to help Johnson, saying that they all "consistently kept the door open to establishing peaceful relations (with China)." His words aptly show that Johnson, at least like Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy, is a jackal of the same lair in pursuing a policy of aggression against China. In his remarks, Rusk repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of his so-called "unconditional talks" is to have the Chinese people agree to the United States' occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and give up their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.
    In his remarks, Rusk frankly admitted that the U.S. government is implementing a "containment policy" toward China. He said that the U.S. policy is to achieve "peace" in the Pacific, and the United States is determined to fulfill its obligations to the countries in that region. He clamored, "If this is containment (of China), then let it be containment."
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 18th dispatch: On the 17th, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk attended a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the U.S. government's tool of aggression – the foreign "aid" program – and requested Congress to approve the program. He said, "The foreign aid program that this committee is now discussing is of great importance to the security and national interests of the United States, both in the short term and in the long term."
    In his speech, Rusk once again stubbornly stated that the United States must stay in South Vietnam and must occupy South Vietnam. Rusk also expressed the hope that "other countries will send more troops to South Vietnam in the near future." Rusk said that in the 1967 fiscal year, 72 percent of the "supporting assistance" (i.e., indirect "military assistance") that the United States gives to other countries or regions will be used for South Vietnam, and most of the "economic assistance" will also be used for South Vietnam. In addition, the United States will "increase aid to Thailand and Laos."

### 腊斯克公然承认美国要推行“遏制中国”政策  诡称美国愿意“改善”中美关系但又叫嚷坚持霸占中国领土台湾

    腊斯克公然承认美国要推行“遏制中国”政策
    诡称美国愿意“改善”中美关系但又叫嚷坚持霸占中国领土台湾
    新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克二十日在电视谈话中竭力为美国政府对中国的侵略和敌视政策进行辩解，但是，他的辩解本身恰恰再次证明，约翰逊政府坚持的正是这种政策。
    由于美国国内广泛阶层的人士担心侵越战争的不断“升级”将导致“同中国迎头相撞”，最近在美国参众两院和舆论界继侵越政策大辩论之后，又展开了一场对华政策的大辩论。正是在这种情况下，腊斯克不得不出来为美国敌视中国的政策进行狡辩。
    腊斯克在谈话中诬蔑中国
  “好斗”，对外进行“攫取”。他说，中国使亚洲“保持紧张局势”，要“通过河内攫取南越”，
  “没有迹象表明北京会成为世界大家庭中忠诚和和平的一员”。他甚至捡起赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反华谰言来作为他攻击中国的根据，说什么“即使在共产党世界中，中国的好斗态度也成了不安的根源”。
    美国国务卿强调美国要继续霸占中国的领土台湾，坚持侵略越南。他一方面说什么美国愿意“改善”同中国的关系，同时又说，中国对就这个问题提出的一切建议都反问道，“你们（美国）是否准备交出福摩萨（即台湾）”。腊斯克说，美国对这个问题的答复是：“不行，我们不准备这样做”，“不准备把中华民国（即台湾蒋介石集团）拱手交出去”。他说，在中美两国已经进行了一百二十九次的大使级会谈中，每当中国提出要美国交还中国领土台湾的时候，“谈话就很难进行下去，因为美国决不会接受这一点”。他还说，“我们也不能同意他们通过河内攫取南越而进行的活动”。
    腊斯克在重申美国坚持对中国的侵略政策的同时，又大谈美国愿意就东南亚和其他问题同中国举行“无条件会谈”，并且说，如果共产党中国表示愿意到会议桌上去的话，“我明天下午就到日内瓦去”。他还说，美国对中国采取“灵活政策”，美国使同中国建立“和平关系的大门敞开”。他还搬出杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪等美帝国主义头子来为约翰逊帮忙，说他们都是“始终使（同中国）建立和平关系的大门敞开”。他的这番话恰好表明，约翰逊至少同杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪等人一样，都是对中国奉行侵略政策的一丘之貉。腊斯克在谈话中一再强调，他所谓“无条件会谈”的目的，就是要中国人民同意美国霸占中国领土台湾和放弃对越南人民抗美救国斗争的支持。
    腊斯克在谈话中直言不讳地承认，美国政府正对中国实行“遏制政策”。他说，美国的政策是使太平洋得到“和平”，美国决心履行它对那个地区的国家的义务。他叫嚷说，“如果这是遏制（中国），那末就算是遏制吧。”
    新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克十七日就美国政府的侵略工具——对外“援助”计划出席众议院外交委员会作证，要求国会批准这个计划。他说，“这个委员会现在正在讨论的援外计划不论是从短期说，还是从长远说，对美国的安全和国家利益都是十分重要的。”
    腊斯克在发言时又一次顽固表示，美国一定要赖在南越不走，一定要侵占南越。腊斯克还表示希望“其他国家在不久的将来将派更多的军队到南越。”腊斯克说，在一九六七财政年度，美国给予其他国家或地区的“支持援助”（即间接“军事援助”）百分之七十二将用于南越，“经济援助”大部分也将用于南越。此外，美国还将“增加对泰国和老挝的援助”。
