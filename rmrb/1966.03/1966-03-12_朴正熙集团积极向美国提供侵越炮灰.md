    Park Chung-hee Clique Actively Provides Cannon Fodder to the U.S. for Aggression Against Vietnam

    U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated defeats and faces numerous difficulties in its war of aggression against Vietnam. One of the serious difficulties is the shortage of troops. U.S. imperialism has tried to drag others into the water to provide cannon fodder for the U.S., but has been rejected by its Western European "allies." Therefore, it has had to settle for second best and entrust the task of providing cannon fodder to American puppets like Park Chung-hee.

    The South Korean Park Chung-hee clique is a loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism. For the benefit of its American master, it does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the people, and has repeatedly provided cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam. Recently, Park Chung-hee, in his "State of the Union Address" to the puppet National Assembly, brazenly described South Vietnam as "our second front," guaranteeing to provide the Saigon puppet clique with "necessary and sufficient" support.

    Since February of last year, the South Korean puppet National Assembly has passed decisions to send accomplice troops to South Vietnam three times. So far, the Park Chung-hee clique has provided more than 20,000 puppet troops to South Vietnam, dispatching the largest number of accomplice troops for its master. Under the command of the American aggressors, these accomplice troops have committed all kinds of evils, burning, killing, and looting, committing heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people. In addition to the combat troops, the Park Chung-hee clique has also sent more than 1,000 engineering and technical personnel to South Vietnam.

    The Park Chung-hee clique not only willingly acts as a loyal lackey of the U.S. aggressors, but also runs around to serve the U.S. imperialism in further expanding its war of aggression. From February 7 to 18, Park Chung-hee, at the instigation of his American master, visited "Malaysia," Thailand, and Taiwan one after another.

    The U.S. ruling clique is "very pleased" with the active service of the Park Chung-hee puppet clique.

    In order to get rid of the predicament on the Vietnam battlefield, the Johnson administration is eager to win over Asian servants to work for it in South Vietnam. The collusion between the U.S. and Park has further intensified. At the beginning of this year, U.S. Vice President Humphrey visited Seoul twice, and held "talks" with South Korean puppet President Park Chung-hee and puppet Prime Minister Chung Il-kwon respectively on the Vietnam issue, and reached an agreement on South Korea sending an additional division and a regiment of 20,000 puppet troops to South Vietnam as cannon fodder. The United States will provide South Korea with more military and economic "assistance," including: the United States will fully equip three reserve divisions in South Korea in the next few years, and update the equipment of the existing seventeen army divisions and one marine corps division; the United States will provide South Korea with 150 million U.S. dollars and other loans in 1966. It is reported that after the United States provided South Korea with 150 million U.S. dollars in August last year, the Park Chung-hee puppet clique decided to send 15,000 accomplice troops to South Vietnam. In November, the United States shipped 30 warships to South Korea. On February 25 this year, another 120 warships were shipped to South Korea; on February 14, 16 American M48 heavy tanks were transferred to the South Korean puppet regime to strengthen the equipment of the puppet army in order to draw more people to South Vietnam as cannon fodder.

    However, the Park Chung-hee clique's following of its American master and continued support for the war of aggression against Vietnam will neither extricate the U.S. aggressors from their predicament nor bring any good end to itself. On the South Vietnam battlefield, the South Korean accomplice troops have been heavily attacked by the South Vietnamese people's armed forces. On April 2, 1965, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and guerrillas fiercely bombarded the barracks of the South Korean accomplice troops not far from Saigon, killing and wounding more than 300 people. On February 12 this year, the army and people of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam, in the anti-"sweeping" battle, smashed the offensive of five companies of South Korean accomplice troops, annihilating more than 200 accomplice troops on the spot. According to incomplete statistics, from January 27 to February 17, the South Vietnam Binh Dinh Provincial Liberation Armed Forces annihilated 400 South Korean accomplice troops in the anti-"sweeping" battle in the Bong Son area. Under the heroic attack of the army and people of South Vietnam, the South Korean accomplice troops have become birds startled by the twang of a bow, and the sentiment of war-weariness is constantly growing. Some committed suicide, some were shot by American officers for refusing to rescue the South Vietnamese puppet army, and 500 people refused to go out for "sweeping" and demanded that they be repatriated to South Korea. As the Vietnamese *People's Daily* pointed out: "Tens of thousands of South Korean accomplice troops have been beaten to a pulp by the army and people of South Vietnam. No matter how many more living targets they sell to the United States, their accomplice troops will still be burned to ashes in the sea of ​​hatred of the people of South Vietnam, along with the U.S. expeditionary force."

### 朴正熙集团积极向美国提供侵越炮灰

    朴正熙集团积极向美国提供侵越炮灰
    美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中，连遭惨败，困难重重。严重的困难之一，是兵力不足。美帝国主义想拖人下水，为美国提供炮灰，遭到它的西欧“盟国”拒绝。因而，它不得不退而求其次，把提供炮灰这件事寄托在象朴正熙之流的美国傀儡身上。
    南朝鲜朴正熙集团是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，为了它的美国主子的利益，不惜牺牲人民的利益，一再为美帝国主义侵越战争提供炮灰。最近，朴正熙在向伪国会发表的“国情咨文”中竟狂妄地把南越说成是“我们的第二战线”，保证要对西贡傀儡集团提供“必要的、充分的”支持。
    去年二月以来，南朝鲜伪国会曾经三次通过派遣帮凶军到南越的决定，到目前为止，朴正熙集团已经向南越提供了两万多傀儡军，为主子派遣了数量最多的帮凶军。这批帮凶军在美国侵略者的指挥下，为非作歹，烧杀抢掠，对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行。除了作战部队之外，朴正熙集团还向南越派遣了一千多名工程技术人员。
    朴正熙集团不仅自己甘当美国侵略者的忠实走狗，而且四处奔走，为美帝进一步扩大侵略战争效劳。二月七日至十八日，朴正熙在美国主子的唆使下，先后到“马来西亚”、泰国和台湾活动。
    美国统治集团对于朴正熙傀儡集团的积极效劳感到“非常高兴”。
    为了摆脱在越南战场上的困境，约翰逊政府正急于拉拢亚洲仆从为它在南越卖命。美朴之间的勾结进一步加紧。今年年初，美国副总统汉弗莱两次到汉城活动，同南朝鲜伪总统朴正熙和伪总理丁一权分别就越南问题举行“会谈”，并就南朝鲜增派一个师和一个团共两万傀儡军去南越充当炮灰一事达成协议。美国将给予南朝鲜更多的军事和经济“援助”，其中包括：美国将在今后几年内完全装备南朝鲜三个后备师，更新现有的陆军十七个师和海军陆战队一个师的装备；美国在一九六六年向南朝鲜提供一亿五千万美元及其他贷款等。据报道，美国在去年八月向南朝鲜提供一亿五千万美元之后，朴正熙傀儡集团就决定派遣一万五千名帮凶军到南越去。十一月，美国又把三十艘战艇运进南朝鲜。今年二月二十五日，又有一百二十艘战艇运到南朝鲜；二月十四日，有十六辆美国M48重型坦克移交给南朝鲜傀儡政权，加强傀儡军的装备，以便抽出更多的人去南越当炮灰。
    但是，朴正熙集团追随美国主子，继续支持侵越战争，既不能使美国侵略者摆脱困境，也不会给它自己带来任何好的下场。在南越战场上，南朝鲜帮凶军遭到南越人民武装的沉重打击。一九六五年四月二日，南越解放军和游击队猛烈轰击离西贡不远的南朝鲜帮凶军兵营，毙伤三百余人。今年二月十二日，越南南方平定省军民，在反“扫荡”战斗中，粉碎了南朝鲜帮凶军五个连的进攻，当场歼灭帮凶军二百多名。据不完全统计，从一月二十七日至二月十七日，越南南方平定省解放武装力量在蓬山地区的反“扫荡”战斗中，就歼灭了南朝鲜帮凶军四百名。在南越军民的英勇打击下，南朝鲜帮凶军已成了惊弓之鸟，厌战情绪不断增长，有的自杀，有的因拒绝去救援南越伪军而被美国军官枪毙，并有五百人拒绝出动“扫荡”，要求把他们遣返南朝鲜。正如越南《人民报》所指出的：“成万名南朝鲜帮凶军已经被越南南方军民打得落花流水。不论他们再卖给美国两万或更多的活靶子，他们的帮凶军仍将同美国远征军一起，在越南南方人民仇恨的火海中被烧成灰烬。”（志光）（附图片）
