    How to Look at Quantity
    The Dongduzhuang Brigade in Xin County has drilled three mechanized wells and one hundred and two brick wells. If we calculate the overall picture, the entire brigade has one or two thousand mu of land that can be irrigated, which means the water conservancy conditions are already quite good. However, after measuring each well and inspecting each plot of land, problems such as unreasonable layout, poor quality of brick wells, and incomplete water tools were discovered. If a severe drought occurs, much of the land still cannot be irrigated. Zeng Guangfu, the Party Branch Secretary, deeply felt: "Whether it's digging wells or doing other work, we can't just look at superficial numbers and be satisfied with the average!"
    A short article signed [by a writer] in the *Dazhong Daily* stated, "Numbers" are important. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must pay attention to the quantitative aspect of situations and problems and have a basic quantitative analysis. Any quality is manifested in a certain quantity; without quantity, there is no quality." Therefore, we must have "numbers" in our minds. If we have no "numbers" in our minds and do not understand the quantitative boundaries that determine the quality of things, two results will occur: either we will be timid and hesitant, and not actively pursue things that could have been done; or we will exceed objective possibilities and try to do things that are fundamentally impossible.
    We cannot be without basic statistics and major percentages. "Numbers" also have superficial and real aspects, general and specific aspects. We cannot be satisfied with general and superficial statistical figures, let alone satisfied with the average. What deserves our special attention is that, under the current excellent situation, people's minds are often easily paralyzed by superficial numbers, satisfied with the general average, and do not go deep to discover problems. In this way, contradictions are concealed, hindering the further development of the revolutionary cause. Comrade Zeng Guangfu has always stood at the forefront of the movement, maintaining a clear and calm mind, and is able to see problems in our progress in the excellent situation. His spirit of being a sober-minded promoter deserves to be learned.

### 怎样看数量

    怎样看数量
    莘县董杜庄大队打了三眼机井、一百零二眼砖井。如果算大账，全大队已有一两千亩地能浇上水，可以说水利条件已经不错了。但是，经过逐井测量、逐块土地检查，就发现了布局不合理，砖井质量不高，水具也不齐全等问题，如果遇上大旱，有许多地还是浇不上水。党支部书记曾广福深有所感地说：“打井也罢，做别的工作也罢，都不能光看表面数字，满足于平均数！”
    《大众日报》发表署名短文说，“数”，是重要的。毛主席教导我们说：“对情况和问题一定要注意到它们的数量方面，要有基本的数量的分析。任何质量都表现为一定的数量，没有数量也就没有质量。”所以，我们必须胸中有“数”。如果胸中无“数”，不懂得决定事物质量的数量界限，就会产生两种结果：或者是束手缩脚，本来有可能办到的事情也不积极去办；或者是超过客观可能，勉强去办一些根本办不到的事情。
    不能没有基本的统计、主要的百分比。“数”又有表面和真实之分，一般与个别之分。不能满足于一般的表面的数字统计，更不能满足于平均数。特别值得我们注意的是，在当前一派大好形势下，人们的思想往往容易为表面数字所麻痹，满足于一般平均数，而不去深入地发现问题。这样，就掩盖了矛盾，妨碍了革命事业的进一步发展。曾广福同志始终站在运动的前头，保持清醒、冷静的头脑，能够在大好形势下，及时看出前进中的问题。他的这种冷静促进派的精神，值得学习。
