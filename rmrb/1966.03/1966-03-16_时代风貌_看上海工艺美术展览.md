    A Reflection of the Times
    ——Seeing the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Exhibition
    Hua Junwu
    Our country's arts and crafts, with their long history, are created by the working people. They use their wisdom and skillful hands to produce thousands upon thousands of beautiful works of art. When people see these artworks made from various materials, they cannot help but exclaim in amazement and praise. Some are truly ingenious in conception and of unimaginable skill.
    Every era and every class requires art to suit its political needs and aesthetic viewpoints. Arts and crafts that existed for a long time in feudal society also served the feudal class in terms of subject matter and content without exception. Fishing, wood gathering, farming, and studying were common themes in traditional paintings and arts and crafts, but the fishermen and farmers under cruel feudal exploitation were depicted as so elegant and leisurely, as if there were no pain or oppression in the world. This kind of content was of course in line with the needs of the feudal class. Even patterns of fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy were in line with the interests and aesthetic viewpoints of the landlord class. As for the arts and crafts selected and sent to the court, without exception they catered to the tastes and preferences of the largest feudal lords both politically and artistically.
    Whether arts and crafts can eliminate the long-term influence of the feudal class in terms of subject matter, content, aesthetic viewpoints and tastes, and whether they can eliminate the aesthetic tastes of the literati, is a major issue concerning whether arts and crafts can break new ground, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialism. Since the founding of the People's Republic, many folk arts and crafts workers have been engaged in innovation, striving to reflect real life in their content and to possess the characteristics of the times.
    However, it is relatively rare to see so much, so concentrated, and so prominently using the spirit of socialist revolution to express our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to express the themes of Chinese revolutionary history and the current world people's revolution, as in the recent Shanghai Arts and Crafts Exhibition.
    Using velvet embroidery to reproduce pictures depicting Chairman Mao and the history of the Chinese revolution, this is a new velvet embroidery that expresses the content of the Chinese proletarian revolution. This is a revolutionary and innovative initiative in embroidery techniques.
    Using large ivory carvings to depict the glorious course of the Chinese revolution, expressing the process of the birth and growth of the Chinese Communist Party, and showing the vigorous scene of socialist revolution and socialist construction since the founding of the People's Republic. Looking at the new China from a single ivory is a very clever concept, highlighting politics and artistically expressing politics. It is traditional art, but it is also innovated art.
    Walking into this exhibition, one will have a very interesting feeling: many major themes in our lives are reflected. It reflects new people and new things, and reflects the three great revolutionary movements. It portrays advanced figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Daqing people, the Dazhai people, and portrays heroic and model figures of the socialist era such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu and Mai Xiande. An ivory carving of a 10,000-ton hydraulic press, and colored lights to depict the explosion of China's first atomic bomb. This is the revolutionization of arts and crafts in terms of subject matter and content. In our arts and crafts, a kind of feudal literati's leisurely sentiment has long occupied a dominant position. I think it has been dispelled in this exhibition, which is a major event. For example, in past Chinese paintings or arts and crafts, shepherd boys were often depicted. Of course, shepherd boys in the old society were mostly exploited and suffered as child laborers, but in artworks they were portrayed as lazy, leisurely, and happy angels. They were either dozing off on the backs of cows, or fighting crickets in the shade of trees; either hanging books on cow horns, or playing short flutes. This is not the true face of shepherd boys' lives, but actually a reflection of the literati's laziness and aversion to labor. Take a small boxwood carving "Morning Song of Jiangnan" for example, this sculpture is very meaningful. Now riding on the back of the cow is a girl carrying a pesticide sprayer, starting a new day of labor. Riding on the back of the cow in both cases, but reflecting two different attitudes toward labor, expressing two different aesthetic viewpoints. This is a new sentiment and a new aesthetic viewpoint in arts and crafts.
    To express new content is different from creation that follows established rules. Some old-content arts and crafts, such as sculptures, are nothing more than things like Li Bai drunk and Magu offering longevity. Naturally, it is not necessary to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers to make these things, just follow the established rules. Now, to express new people and new things, if you do not integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, you cannot correctly express them. The practice of Shanghai arts and crafts workers going deep into life to create is completely correct, and is also an important reason for the success of many works this time.
    If we do not use old habits and prejudices to look at these new-content arts and crafts, we will feel that the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Exhibition is full of vigorous innovative spirit. Chairman Mao said: "As for the new culture, it is something that reflects the new politics and new economy in the ideological form, and serves the new politics and new economy." The innovation of the Shanghai arts and crafts community is the result of following Chairman Mao's instructions. It enables arts and crafts to break away from outdated content and move towards a new world.
    However, some people think that most of the works in the exhibition are unaffordable for the masses, so they cannot be popularized, and therefore doubt whether the direction is correct. Here, I think we should look at it from two aspects. First, we strive for certain products to be innovated in terms of materials and craftsmanship, reduce costs, and facilitate popularization. On the other hand, certain materials such as ivory, jade, and certain precious woods are inherently expensive, and the production is labor-intensive, so they can only be used for national displays and exhibitions, and can only be popularized through these methods. It represents a country's high level of art or technology. It is impossible and unnecessary for everyone to be able to afford it. This is not only the case with arts and crafts, but there are similar situations in other parts of art. The original of an oil painting or a sculpture is also popularized to the masses through display exhibitions or reproduced as printed matter. Therefore, it is a one-sided view to require that certain works in arts and crafts can be purchased by the masses to be considered popularization.
    The direction of Shanghai's arts and crafts is correct, and most of the works are successful. The sentiment is healthy. This is the basic aspect, which does not mean that it is impeccable. Some sculptures still lack vividness in the portrayal of figures, the colors of some velvet embroideries can be improved, and the patterns of some works still seem outdated and cumbersome. Due to the innovation of content, there are still contradictions between the expression of new life and traditional artistic expression techniques, which is almost inevitable when a new thing appears in art, and needs to be gradually overcome in artistic practice. There are a large number of folk arts and crafts workers in our country, who create many works of art. We should care about their work and cooperate with each other. What we should pay more attention to and learn from is the revolutionary spirit shown by the Shanghai arts and crafts community this time. (Attached pictures)

    时代风貌
    ——看上海工艺美术展览
    华君武
    有悠久历史的我国工艺美术品是劳动人民所创造的，他们用智慧和巧手制作出了千千万万优美的工艺美术品。人们在看到用各种各样材料制成的艺术品时，都不禁会发出惊叹声，赞美声。有一些真是构思巧妙，难以想象的技艺。
    每个时代，每个阶级都要艺术适合本阶级的政治需要和审美观点。长期在封建社会存在的工艺美术品，也毫无例外地在题材内容上为封建阶级服务。渔、樵、耕、读是传统绘画和工艺美术常常表现的题材，但是在残酷封建剥削下的渔民、农民却被描绘成那样雅致、那样优闲，似乎在人世间就没有痛苦和压迫似的。这种表现的内容，当然是符合封建阶级的需要的。就是一些福、禄、寿、喜的图案，也都是符合地主阶级的利益和审美观点的。至于那些被选送到宫廷里的工艺美术品，就在政治上和艺术上无一不是迎合最大的封建主的口胃和喜爱了。
    工艺美术能否在题材内容和审美观点和趣味上驱除封建阶级长期施加的影响，能否驱除士大夫的审美情趣，是工艺美术能否推陈出新，为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的大问题。建国以来，我们已有不少民间工艺美术工作者在从事革新的尝试，在内容上力求反映现实生活，具有时代的特征。
    但是象最近上海工艺美术展览会这样大量、集中、突出地用社会主义革命精神来表现我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，表现中国革命历史和当前世界人民革命的题材，在过去许多工艺美术展览会里还是比较少见的。
    用绒绣复制了表现毛主席、表现中国革命历史的图画，这就是表现中国无产阶级革命内容的新绒绣。这是刺绣工艺上推陈出新的革命创举。
    用大象牙雕刻出中国革命的光辉历程，表现中国共产党产生和成长的过程，表现了建国以来社会主义革命和社会主义建设的蓬勃景象。从一根象牙来看新中国，是非常巧妙的构思，它突出了政治，又艺术地表现了政治。它是传统的艺术，但又是革新了的艺术。
    走进这个展览会，会有一种很有意思的感觉：我们生活中的许多重大题材，大多有了反映。它反映了新人新事，反映了三大革命运动。它刻划了工农兵里的先进人物大庆人，大寨人，刻划了社会主义时代的英雄模范人物雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄和麦贤得。用象牙雕出的万吨水压机，用彩灯表现出我国第一颗原子弹的爆炸。这是工艺美术品在题材内容上的革命化。在我们工艺美术品里，长期盘踞着一种封建士大夫的闲情逸致，我认为在这个展览会里被驱散了，这是一件大事。比方说，过去的中国绘画或工艺美术品里，牧童是常常被描写的对象，牧童在旧社会当然大多是被剥削的遭受苦难的童工，但是在艺术品里却被刻划成为懒散的、优闲的、快乐的天使，他们不是趴在牛背上打瞌睡，就是在树荫下斗蟋蟀；不是牛角挂书，就是横吹短笛，这不是牧童生活的真正面貌，实际是士大夫的不事劳动、懒散情绪的反映。就拿一件小小的黄杨木雕“江南晨曲”来说，这件雕塑就很有意味，现在骑在牛背上的是一个背着农药喷雾器的姑娘，正在开始新的一天的劳动。同样骑在牛背上，但是却反映了对待劳动的两种态度，表达了两种不同的审美观点。这是工艺美术里新的情调，新的审美观点。
    要表现新内容就和因袭成法的创作有所不同，有些旧内容的工艺美术品，拿雕塑来说，不外乎是李白醉酒和麻姑献寿一类的东西，做这些东西自然用不着深入工农兵生活，只要按照成规去做就可以了。现在要表现新人新事，如果不去和工农兵结合，就不能正确地表现他们，上海工艺美术工作者深入生活搞创作的作法是完全正确的，也是这次许多作品得到成功的重要原因。
    如果不是用旧习惯和偏见来看待这些新内容的工艺美术品，我们就会感到上海这次工艺美术展览会里充满着朝气蓬勃的革新精神。毛主席说过：“至于新文化，则是在观念形态上反映新政治和新经济的东西，是替新政治新经济服务的。”上海工艺美术界的革新就是按照毛主席指示办事的结果。它使工艺美术从陈旧的内容脱出，走向一个新的世界。
    但是也有一些人认为展览会里的作品大多数是群众买不起的，因此也就不能普及，因而怀疑方向对不对头。这里我想应当从两个方面来看。第一我们力求某些产品，能在材料工艺上革新，降低成本，便于普及。另一方面某些材料例如象牙、玉石和某些贵重木材等，本身就是昂贵的，制作又是费工的，只能成为国家陈列、展览之用，它只能通过这些方式去普及。它代表一个国家高度的艺术或技术水平。不可能也不需要人人买得起。这不仅只是工艺美术品，就在美术的其它部分里也有类似的情况。一张油画或一座雕塑的原作也是通过陈列展览或复制成印刷品才向群众普及的。因此要求工艺美术中某些作品能为群众购买才算普及，是一种片面的观点。
    上海工艺美术的方向是正确的，大多数作品是成功的。情调是健康的。这是基本的一面，这并不等于说是无懈可击了。某些雕塑人物形象刻画上还不够生动，某些绒绣的色彩还可以改进，某些作品的图案还显得陈旧烦琐，由于内容革新，表现新生活和传统艺术表现手法之间也还存在矛盾，这在艺术上一件新事物出现时几乎是不可避免的，需要在艺术实践里逐步克服的。在我国有大量的民间工艺美术工作者，他们创造出许多艺术品，我们应当去关怀他们的工作，互相协作。而我们更加应当重视和学习的，就是上海工艺美术界这次所表现的革命精神。（附图片）
