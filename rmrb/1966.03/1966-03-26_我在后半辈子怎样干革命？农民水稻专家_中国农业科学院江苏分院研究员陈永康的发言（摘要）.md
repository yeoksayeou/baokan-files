(Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th) Chen Yongkang, the famous farmer rice expert and researcher at the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, recently gave a speech at the National Rural Mass Scientific Experiment Movement Experience Exchange Conference held in Fuzhou City. The title of his speech was: "How Should I Carry Out Revolution in My Later Years?" An abstract follows:

    Now, I would like to discuss the following question: How should I carry out revolution in my later years?

      Revolution to the End, Transformation Until Old Age

    I have studied Chairman Mao’s article “In Memory of Norman Bethune” many times. After each study, I would think: Bethune was a foreigner, yet he could serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly. I am a member of the Chinese Communist Party, so I should even more wholeheartedly serve the people and the revolution. Recently, after hearing about the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao’s good student, I have become even more determined to carry out revolution to the end, transform myself until old age, and serve the people better and dedicate everything to the revolution in my later years.

    After joining the Party in 1954, I transformed from a peasant into a proletarian revolutionary fighter. The Party organization constantly educated me that a Communist Party member should place the interests of the revolution as their first priority and subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolution. I have frequently demanded of myself and transformed myself according to these standards. Encouraged and supported by the Party organization, I became increasingly enthusiastic in studying rice cultivation techniques, determined to contribute more to the people. In 1958, after I presented the concept of "Three Blacks and Three Yellows" at the National Rice Science Work Conference, it immediately attracted the attention of the Party and agricultural scientists. The Party transferred me to the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences as a researcher. I never imagined that this muddy-legged peasant would enter the doors of the Academy of Sciences and engage in scientific research. I often think that the honor I have today is entirely given by the Party and the people, and entirely brought about by the revolution. I myself am nothing great. I should wholeheartedly work for the revolution and serve the people.

    After arriving at the Jiangsu Branch, I resolved to work with the scientists to constantly seek ways for higher and even higher rice yields. I will contribute as much strength as I can to the development of socialist agricultural science and technology.

      "Lao Lai Qing" [Old Arrive Green] is a late-rice variety I cultivated before liberation, and it has been promoted in many places. Later, I saw that the "Nongken No. 58" variety was even better than "Lao Lai Qing," so I began cultivation trials in 1963 to study the characteristics and cultivation techniques of this new variety, and suggested its promotion. Someone once asked me: "'Lao Lai Qing' is your original variety, and also a high-yielding variety. Now you want it to give way to the new variety, are you willing?" I felt very strange when I heard this question. The point of developing varieties is nothing more than to achieve higher and higher yields. If there is a new variety with higher yields, what is there to be unwilling about giving up the older, inferior variety? I think as long as you think of revolution in your mind, what is there that an individual can be unwilling to give up?

    Studying Comrade Jiao Yulu’s glorious deeds of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people has deeply moved me. His mind was filled with revolution, and he thought of the people. Even until his death, he did not forget the matter of the people in disaster areas turning over a new leaf. Compared to him, I am far behind. I am determined to use Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, constantly examine myself, and use Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, and learn from him forever. I am determined to live until that day and carry out revolution until that day. In our country, with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the People's Communes, as long as we are all like Comrade Jiao Yulu – not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or difficulty, not fearing death – not only can the backwardness of agriculture be quickly changed, but also the world’s advanced levels can be surpassed. I am determined that in my later years, under the leadership of the Party, together with the scientists and the masses, I will do two things well for the revolution. One is to gradually create a set of the most advanced and highest-yielding rice high-yield experiences. The other is to pass on everything I know to the younger generation, and cultivate successors for the revolution.

          Be Honest, Do Honest Work

    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a model of seeking truth from facts, and I will always learn from him. Only by being honest and doing honest work can we wholeheartedly serve the people. I have come to realize that if we are not pragmatic, the things we do will harm the Party, harm the people, and harm the revolution. Chairman Mao’s words gave me great encouragement. He said: "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in accordance with the interests of the people…" I must adhere to Chairman Mao’s words in the future. Farming is like doing any other thing. If you want to make a name for yourself, there is no other trick but to rely on honesty. Fearing hardship won't work, fearing difficulty won't work, and fearing trouble won't work either. Someone once asked me: How can your rice-growing experience be used well? I said, first be serious, second rely on hard work, and third summarize. There is no clever way to get high yields. Of course, hard work is not reckless work, we must also pay attention to clever work and pay attention to practical results. The labor that should be spent must be spent, and the effort that should not be spent should not be spent. Labor should be used at critical junctures. With the spirit of hard work, we can have clever methods. In production, to promote a new technology or a new experience well and use it well, the most important thing is to have the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai people who are not afraid of hardship or difficulty.

    I often think this way: We who are engaged in agricultural science and technology work, when researching a new technology, must consider whether it can be applied on a large area, must consider whether it can increase production, and at the same time must consider whether it can reduce costs. The new technologies that can increase production with less money or no money are most welcomed by the masses. Now some places have a great interest in chemical fertilizers. I believe that even if the country's chemical fertilizer production develops in the future, chemical fertilizers cannot be used as the main fertilizer. Using too much chemical fertilizer not only increases costs, but also is not good for the soil. In particular, the base fertilizer and thickening fertilizer for "Nongken No. 58" should rely mainly on organic fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer can only be used to catch "yellow sugar" and hang spikes. This saves money and can improve the soil, making the soil more and more fertile, and ensuring stable and high yields. We who are engaged in agricultural science and technology should create conditions for farmers to develop agricultural production through self-reliance.

    I have come to realize that we who are engaged in agricultural science and technology, if we want to produce some scientific achievements that are truly welcomed by the peasant masses and meet the needs of agricultural production development, there is also no other trick but to rely on an honest attitude. We must consciously go downstairs and out of the hospital, set up sample points, squat down and go deep, and honestly learn from the masses and sincerely rely on the masses. If we don't do this, we won't be able to make a name for ourselves.

          First Be a Student, Then Be a Teacher

    In recent years, many places that grow rice have been promoting my rice cultivation experience. In fact, the experience being promoted now cannot be regarded as my personal experience. The original experience included the experience of the masses in the Taihu area, and was later summarized and improved by scientists. In the process of large-scale promotion in recent years, it has been supplemented and developed by the masses and scientists. This experience is entirely the product of the "three combinations" of leaders, masses, and scientists, and is the product of collective wisdom and collective labor. The process of learning and promoting this set of high-yield rice experience is precisely the process of my constantly learning from scientists and from the masses.

    My rice growing experience was originally very fragmented and unsystematic. I only knew what to do to make it better. As for why I had to do it that way, I was not completely clear. After arriving at the Jiangsu Branch in 1958, I gradually became clear with the help of scientists.

    Beginning in 1962, a set of high-yield rice experience summarized and researched with scientists was taken to the Taihu area, applied on a large area from point to area, and applied to various sample fields with different conditions. Many good experiences of the masses were continuously absorbed, and many new contents were added, and it has been developed year by year. The masses have taught me a lot. The practice of the masses has made this set of experience more and more complete, more and more in line with the growth law of rice, and more and more adaptable to different production conditions, and the scope of application has become larger and larger.

    Chairman Mao said it so correctly: The masses are the real heroes. One person's ability is limited, but the wisdom of the masses is boundless. Constantly learning from the masses and constantly asking the masses for advice can help us to move forward and improve continuously. In this regard, compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of often "living in thatched huts" and "squatting in cattle sheds" to seek advice from the poor and lower-middle peasants, I am far behind. In the future, I must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example and better learn from the masses, especially from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Living water flows forever, and experience is endless.

    I deeply realize that any advanced production experience will not be perfect, and will not be good to the top and unchanging. Only by constantly experimenting, constantly summarizing, and constantly supplementing in the process of promotion and application can it continue to develop. Otherwise, if production develops forward, but the experience is still the old set, its role in production will become smaller and smaller.

    The method of constantly summing up experience taught to us by Chairman Mao is the magic weapon for the continuous development of high-yield rice experience. The original experience of early sowing and early transplanting on green manure stubble has been developed through practice and summary to be able to be used for late sowing and late transplanting on wheat stubble. The original experience of cultivating "Lao Lai Qing" has been developed through practice and summary into the 1,000-jin high-yield technology of "Nongken No. 58". The original experience used for late rice has also begun to have some ways to be used for middle rice and early rice through practice and summary. This set of experience, through continuous summary, continuous development, and continuous improvement, has played an increasingly important role in production. Since last year, this set of rice cultivation experience has also crossed the Yangtze River, to the Lixiahe area of ​​northern Jiangsu, and to the new rice areas on the Huanghuai Plain. I heard that it has also achieved good harvests. We are currently preparing to summarize it. I think that through this summary, the content of this set of experience will be richer and the scope of application will be wider.

    我在后半辈子怎样干革命？
    农民水稻专家
    中国农业科学院江苏分院研究员陈永康的发言（摘要）
    据新华社福州二十五日电　著名的农民水稻专家、中国农业科学院江苏分院研究员陈永康，最近在福州市举行的全国农村群众科学实验运动经验交流会议上作了发言。他的发言题目是：《我在后半辈子怎样干革命？》摘要如下：
    现在，我想谈这样一个问题：我在后半辈子怎样干革命？
      革命到底，改造到老
    毛主席写的《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，我曾经学习过好多遍。在每次学习以后，我都这样想：白求恩是一个外国人，能一心一意地为中国人民服务，我是中国共产党的一个党员，就更应该一心为人民，一心为革命。最近，听了毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹以后，更加使我坚定了这样的决心：要革命到底，改造到老，一定要在后半辈子为人民服务得更好，为革命献出一切。
    一九五四年我入党以后，从一个农民变成了无产阶级的革命战士。党组织不断地教育我，一个共产党员，应该以革命利益为第一生命，应该以个人利益服从革命利益。我就经常地按这样的标准要求自己，改造自己。在党组织的鼓励支持下，我钻研水稻栽培技术的劲头越来越大，决心为人民多贡献一点力量。一九五八年，我在全国水稻科学工作会议上，提出了“三黑三黄”的看法以后，立即引起了党和农业科学家们的重视，党就把我调到中国农业科学院江苏分院当起了研究员。真想不到我这个泥腿子还会跨进科学院的大门，搞科学研究工作。我经常想，我今天这样的荣誉，全是党给的，人民给的，全是革命带来的，我自己并没有啥了不起，我应该一心一意为革命工作，为人民服务。
    到了江苏分院以后，我就决心跟科学家们一道，不断地为水稻高产更高产寻找门路。为了发展社会主义农业科学技术，有多少力，出多少力。
      “老来青”是我在解放前培育出来的一个晚稻品种，好多地方都推广了。后来，我看到“农垦58号”品种比“老来青”还要好，从一九六三年起就进行栽培试验，研究这个新品种的特性和栽培技术，建议推广。有人曾经问过我：“‘老来青’是你的起家品种，又是高产良种，现在要它让位给新品种，舍得吗？”我听到这个问题感到很奇怪：搞品种，无非是为了高产更高产，有了更高产的新品种，丢掉比较差的老品种，有什么舍不得呢？我想只要头脑里想的是革命，个人还有什么东西舍不得呢？
    学习了焦裕禄同志一心为革命，一心为人民的光辉事迹，使我受到很深的感动。他头脑里装的是革命，想的是人民，一直到临死的时候，还不忘灾区人民翻身的事，我跟他比起来差得很远。我决心以焦裕禄同志当镜子，经常对照检查自己，我决心以焦裕禄同志为榜样，永远向他学习。我决心活到那一天，就革命到那一天。在我们的国家里，有党和毛主席领导，有毛泽东思想指引，又有人民公社，只要我们都象焦裕禄同志那样不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕难，不怕死，不但农业落后面貌可以很快改变，而且世界先进水平也可以超过。我决心在我的后半辈子，要在党的领导下，跟科学家和群众一道，要为革命做好两件事。一件是：逐步创造出一套最先进的、产量最高的水稻高产经验；还有一件是：把自己所懂得的一切，全部交给青年一代，为革命培养接班人。
          做老实人，办老实事
    焦裕禄同志是个实事求是的模范，我要永远向他学习。只有做老实人，办老实事，才能真心真意地为人民服务。我体会到，如果不实事求是，做出来的事，就要害党、害人民、害革命。毛主席的话给了我很大的鼓舞。他说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，……。”我今后一定要坚持照着毛主席的话去做。种田跟干其他任何事情一样，要想搞出一点名堂来，没有别的窍门，只有靠老老实实。怕吃苦不行，怕困难不行，也不能怕麻烦。有人曾经问我：你的种稻经验怎样才能用得好？我说，第一要认真，第二靠苦干，第三要总结。想高产没有偷巧的办法。当然，苦干不是蛮干，还要讲究巧干，讲究实效。该多花的工，一定要多花，不该出的力，就不要出，劳力要用在关口上。有了苦干的精神，才能有巧干的办法。在生产上，要把一项新技术、新经验推广得好、用得好，最重要的，就是要有大寨人那种不怕苦、不怕难的革命精神。
    我常这样想，我们搞农业科学技术工作的人，研究一样新技术，一定要考虑大面积能不能应用，一定要考虑能不能提高产量，同时还要考虑能不能降低成本。凡是能少花钱、不花钱能增产的新技术，群众就最欢迎。现在有些地方，对化肥的兴趣很大。我认为，就是今后国家化肥生产发展了，也不能把化肥当主要肥料，化肥用多了，不仅增加成本，同时对土壤没有好处。特别是“农垦58号”基肥和长粗肥更应该靠有机肥为主，化肥只能用来捉捉“黄糖”，吊吊穗子，这样既省钱，又能改良土壤，使土壤越种越肥，保证稳产高产。我们研究农业科学技术的人，应该为农民自力更生地发展农业生产创造条件。
    我体会到，我们搞农业科学技术的人，要想搞出一些真正受农民群众欢迎、适合农业生产发展需要的科学成果来，同样没有别的窍门，还是要靠老老实实的态度，要自觉地下楼出院，蹲点办样板，蹲下去了还要深下去，还要老老实实地向群众学习，真心诚意地依靠群众。不这样，就不会搞出什么名堂来。
          先当学生，后当先生
    近几年来，许多种水稻的地方，都在推广我栽培水稻的经验。其实，现在推广的这套经验，不能算是我个人的经验。原来的经验里，就包含了太湖地区群众的经验，后来又经过科学家总结提高，在近几年大面积推广过程中，又经过群众和科学家补充发展。这套经验完全是领导、群众和科学家“三结合”的产物，是集体智慧和集体劳动的产物。学习和推广这套水稻高产经验的过程，正是我不断地向科学家、向群众学习的过程。
    我的种稻经验，原来很零碎，不系统，我只晓得要怎样做才好，至于为啥要那样做，我并不完全清楚。一九五八年到了江苏分院以后，在科学家的帮助下，才逐渐认识清楚。
    从一九六二年开始，同科学家一起总结研究的一套水稻高产经验，拿到太湖地区，由点到面地大面积应用推广，拿到各种条件不同的样板田里去应用，不断地吸取群众的好经验，补充了许多新内容，逐年地得到了发展。群众使我学到了许多东西。群众的实践，使这套经验越来越完整，越来越切合水稻的生长规律，越来越适应不同的生产条件，可以推广应用的范围，也就越来越大了。
    毛主席说得实在正确：群众是真正的英雄。一个人的本事有限，群众的智慧无边。不断地向群众学习，不断地向群众请教，才能不停地前进，不断地提高。在这方面，与焦裕禄同志那种经常“住草庵”、“蹲牛棚”，向贫下中农求教的精神相比，差得很远。今后一定要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，更好地向群众学习，特别是向贫下中农学习。活水长流，经验无尽
    我深深地体会到，任何先进的生产经验，都不会是十全十美的，都不会是好到了顶，不变化的。只有在推广应用过程中，不断地实验，不断地总结，不断地补充，才能不断地向前发展。不然的话，生产向前发展了，经验还是老一套，在生产中的作用就会愈变愈小。
    毛主席教给我们的不断总结经验的方法，是水稻高产经验能够不断发展的法宝。原来是在绿肥茬口上的早播早栽的经验，通过实践、总结，发展到能用于小麦茬口上的晚播晚栽了；原来栽培“老来青”的经验，又是经过实践、总结，发展成“农垦58号”的千斤高产技术；原来用于晚稻的经验，通过实践、总结，对如何用于中稻和早稻，也开始有了门路。这套经验，通过不断总结，不断发展，不断提高，在生产中的作用越来越大。从去年开始，这套水稻栽培经验，还过了长江，到了苏北里下河地区，到了黄淮平原上的新稻区，听说也得到蛮好的收成。目前正在准备进行总结。我想，通过这次总结，这套经验的内容就会更加丰富，适用的范围也会更加广泛了。
