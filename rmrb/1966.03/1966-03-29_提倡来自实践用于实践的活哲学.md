    Advocate a Living Philosophy That Comes From and Is Used for Practice
    The important characteristic of the current domestic situation in our country is, on the one hand, a flourishing high tide of production and construction, and on the other hand, a flourishing high tide of studying Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres across the country have actively participated in this study movement. The philosophical thought of "one divides into two," the transformation of matter into spirit and spirit into matter, has been understood by an increasing number of people and is being applied more and more widely to the revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, achieving great results.
    In the practice of studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought, many workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres have summarized their experiences, understandings, and lessons in this regard, and have written many excellent articles. These articles have educated the entire body of cadres and the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves. The editorial department of *Philosophical Research* has selected a hundred examples from these articles, illustrating the fundamental law of materialist dialectics—the law of the unity of opposites—from various aspects, and has published a "Foreword" expounding Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution to Marxist dialectics. This is a very meaningful undertaking. Our philosophical journals and philosophical workers should focus their attention on these living philosophies that come from practice and are used for practice, publish such living philosophies, study such living philosophies, write such living philosophies, and end the scholastic philosophy that goes from books to books and from concepts to concepts.
    The most prominent feature of the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical works is that they study with class feelings, apply what they learn, and integrate theory with practice to the greatest extent. This also reflects the characteristics of Marxist philosophy, namely its class nature and its practicality. Workers, peasants, and soldiers use the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to study the struggles and work they are engaged in, to find the regularity within them, and based on the understanding of this regularity, to improve their work, reduce blindness, and increase awareness, taking a step forward on the road from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. Freedom is the recognition of necessity and the transformation of the objective world. Without the recognition of objective laws, there is no freedom. However, if we only stop at recognizing objective laws and do not transform the world according to these laws, people still cannot attain freedom. Freedom is not realized in people's minds, but in the process of the transformation of matter into spirit and spirit into matter based on practice. The superiority of workers, peasants, and soldiers over intellectuals lies in the fact that they learn philosophy from the needs of practice and act immediately upon understanding. This is particularly worthy of learning for intellectuals.
    It should be said that cadres, especially leading cadres, have very good conditions for studying Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought. Many of our cadres have organized tens of thousands of people to carry out revolutionary struggles and production struggles, accumulating considerable practical experience, which is the basis for studying Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought. We should have more cadres, like workers, peasants, and soldiers, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to better summarize their experiences, understandings, and lessons, to improve their philosophical thinking level, and to better lead the masses forward.
    The current focus of cadres studying Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical thought is to overcome bourgeois metaphysics and to overcome one-sidedness and absolutism in their thinking methods. This metaphysical way of thinking hinders the progress of various tasks. For example, paying attention to economy and business while neglecting politics; paying attention to material factors while neglecting human factors; paying attention to going all out while neglecting scientific attitude; paying attention to scientific attitude while neglecting going all out; or not seeing the factors of difficulty in times of success; or not seeing the factors of smoothness in times of difficulty. All of these violate Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical thought. We should use the dialectical method, that is, the method of conducting concrete analysis of concrete problems, to summarize the experiences of the past sixteen years, especially the past eight years, to correctly understand the positive and negative experiences and lessons, to understand the objective laws of the development of things, to overcome one-sidedness and absolutism, to develop the ability to comprehensively observe and deal with problems, and to earnestly use the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to think and work.
    More than twenty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to "cast off the baggage" and "start up the machinery." He said, "To remove the strong blindness within our Party, we must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and develop the habit of analysis." Striving to study Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought of "one divides into two" and using this thought to summarize work experience will make it possible to gradually reduce blindness, increase awareness, add a little dialectics, and reduce a little metaphysics.
    To advocate a living philosophy that comes from practice and is used for practice, professional philosophical workers must strive to learn from the masses and learn from actual life. Some philosophical workers have already felt the pressure of the situation and are determined to go deep into factories, villages, shops, and companies to study actual problems. We hope that more philosophical workers will go to the grassroots level, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn how they read Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical books with deep class feelings, learn how they apply Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought to actual struggles, and learn how they use vivid and simple language to write philosophical articles. Only through long-term such learning can it be hoped to change the bookishness and student airs of some philosophical workers, gradually master the method of linking theory with practice, and write philosophy that comes from practice and is welcomed by workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres.
    Striving to study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical thought, advocating a living philosophy that comes from practice and is used for practice, will bring about a revolutionary change in our philosophical front. This change will directly affect our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and promote the progress of all undertakings in our country.

### 提倡来自实践用于实践的活哲学

    提倡来自实践用于实践的活哲学
    目前我国国内形势的重要特点，一方面是蓬勃发展着的生产建设高潮，一方面是蓬勃发展着的学习毛泽东思想的高潮。全国广大工农兵群众和革命干部纷纷投入了这个学习运动。一分为二，物质变精神、精神变物质的哲学思想，已经为越来越多的人所理解，并且越来越广泛地运用到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的革命运动当中，收到极大的效果。
    在学习和运用毛泽东同志哲学思想的实践中，许多工农兵群众和革命干部，总结了自己这方面的心得、体会和经验，写了许多出色的文章。这些文章教育了全体干部和工农兵群众自己。《哲学研究》编辑部从这些文章当中，摘选了一百个实例，从各个方面说明了对立统一规律这个唯物辩证法的根本规律，并且发表“前言”，阐述了毛泽东同志对马克思主义辩证法的伟大贡献，这是一件很有意义的工作。我们的哲学刊物、哲学工作者都应当把注意力集中到这些来自实践、用于实践的活哲学，发表这样的活哲学，学习这样的活哲学，写作这样的活哲学，结束从书本到书本，从概念到概念那样的经院哲学。
    工农兵学习毛泽东同志哲学著作的最鲜明的特点，是带着阶级感情学，学了就用，理论和实践最大限度地结合起来。而这也正反映了马克思主义哲学的特点，即它的阶级性和实践性。工农兵用一分为二的观点，来研究自己所进行的斗争和工作，找寻其中的规律性，并且根据对于这种规律性的认识，来改进自己的工作，减少了盲目性，提高了自觉性，在从必然王国到自由王国的道路上，前进了一步。自由是对必然的认识和对客观世界的改造。没有对客观规律性的认识，就没有自由。但是，如果仅仅停留于认识客观规律，而不去按照规律改造世界，人们还是不能得到自由。自由不是在人的头脑中实现的，而是实现于以实践为基础的物质变精神、精神变物质的过程中。工农兵比知识分子高明之处，就在于他们是由实践的需要出发来学哲学的，并且一经认识，立即行动。这是特别值得知识分子学习的地方。
    应当说，干部，特别是领导干部，在学习毛泽东同志的哲学思想方面，是有很好的条件的。我们的许多干部曾经组织成千成万的群众进行革命斗争和生产斗争，积累了相当丰富的实践经验，这就是学习毛泽东同志哲学思想的基础。我们应当有更多的干部，也象工农兵那样，更好地学习和运用毛泽东思想，更好地总结自己的心得、体会和经验，提高自己的哲学思想水平，更好地领导群众前进。
    目前干部学习毛泽东同志辩证法思想的重点，是克服资产阶级的形而上学，克服思想方法上的片面性和绝对化。这种形而上学的思想方法，阻碍着各项工作的前进。例如，注意了经济和业务，忽略了政治；注意了物的因素，忽略了人的因素；注意了鼓足干劲，忽略了科学态度；注意了科学态度，又忽略了鼓足干劲；或者在成功的时候，看不到困难的因素；或者在困难的时候，又看不到顺利的因素。诸如此类，都违背了毛泽东同志的辩证法思想。我们应当运用辩证的方法，也就是对具体问题进行具体分析的方法，把十六年来的经验，特别是最近八年来的经验，加以总结，正确地认识正面和反面的经验教训，认识事物发展的客观规律，克服片面性和绝对化，锻炼全面地观察和处理问题的能力，认真地用一分为二的观点去思索、去工作。
    二十多年以前，毛泽东同志就教导我们“放下包袱”“开动机器”。他说：“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”努力学习毛泽东同志的一分为二的哲学思想，并且运用这种思想总结工作经验，就有可能逐步减少盲目性，提高自觉性，增加一点辩证法，减少一点形而上学。
    提倡来自实践、用于实践的活哲学，专业的哲学工作者要努力向群众学习，到实际生活中学习。一部分哲学工作者已经感到形势逼人，下决心深入工厂、农村、商店、连队，努力研究实际问题。我们希望有更多的哲学工作者到基层去，向工农兵学习，学习他们如何带着深厚的阶级感情来读毛泽东同志的哲学书，学习他们如何应用毛泽东同志的哲学思想于实际斗争，学习他们如何运用生动朴素的语言来写作哲学文章。只有经过长期的这样的学习，才可以指望改变一部分哲学工作者的书生气和学生腔，逐步掌握理论联系实际的方法，写出从实践中来的哲学，写出为工农兵和革命干部所欢迎的哲学。
    努力学习和运用毛泽东同志的辩证法思想，提倡来自实践、用于实践的活哲学，将使我们的哲学战线发生革命性的变化。这种变化将直接影响到我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，促进我国各项事业的前进。
