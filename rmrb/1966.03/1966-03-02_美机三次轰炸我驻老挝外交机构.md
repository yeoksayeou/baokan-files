    As the United States expands its aggression against Laos, U.S. aircraft have repeatedly bombed our diplomatic institutions in Laos, openly provoking the Chinese people.
    On June 11, 1964, U.S. fighter-bombers invaded the Xieng Khouang region of Laos and carried out a barbaric bombing of Kang Khai City, the former seat of the Lao Royal Government, hitting the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos, wounding five members of our delegation and killing one person.
    On November 20, 1965, the United States again dispatched four F-105 aircraft to frantically bomb Kang Khai City, the former seat of the Lao Royal Government, firing rockets and dropping bombs on the residences of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos and the Xinhua News Agency's Kang Khai branch, causing serious damage to the houses and equipment of both residences.
    On the morning of February 18, 1966, four U.S. jet fighter-bombers invaded northern Laos to bomb and strafe Phong Saly City, and attacked the Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly. More than 200 bullet holes were found in the courtyard of our Consulate General, and more than 50 bullet holes were found in the buildings, causing serious damage to the buildings and property.

    美机三次轰炸我驻老挝外交机构
    随着美国扩大对老挝的侵略，美国飞机多次轰炸我驻老挝外交机构，对中国人民进行公开挑衅。
    一九六四年六月十一日，美国战斗轰炸机侵入老挝川圹地区，对原老挝王国政府所在地康开市进行野蛮的轰炸，命中中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地，炸伤我代表团工作人员五人，炸死一人。
    一九六五年十一月二十日，美国再次派遣F—105型飞机四架疯狂轰炸老挝前王国政府所在地康开市，向中国驻老挝经济文化代表团和新华社康开分社住所发射火箭、投掷炸弹，使两处住所的房屋、设备遭受严重破坏。
    一九六六年二月十八日上午，四架美国喷气式战斗轰炸机侵入老挝北部对丰沙里市进行轰炸、扫射，并且袭击了中国驻丰沙里总领事馆。我总领事馆院内中弹二百余处，房屋中弹五十多处，造成房屋和财产的严重损失。
