    The Sato Government and the "Nuclear Umbrella"
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    The Japanese Sato government recently openly declared that Japan is under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella," and that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" "of course includes" U.S. nuclear weapons "defending" Japan; clamoring that Japan has already joined the U.S. "nuclear strategy system." This once again exposes the ugly face of the Sato government willingly acting as an instrument of aggression for U.S. imperialism.

    Japanese militarism is accelerating its revival. Since Sato came to power, he has not only desperately strengthened conventional military forces, but also tried to rely on U.S. imperialism to dabble in nuclear weapons, preparing for the nuclear armament of Japanese militarism. After the signing of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," the Sato government did not conceal its view that Japan possessing nuclear weapons "is not necessarily unconstitutional." The meaning of the Sato government's openly declaring that Japan is under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" is self-evident.

    May we ask, who is threatening Japan with nuclear weapons, making it necessary for Sato and his ilk to seek "nuclear protection"? The Sato government has been spreading rumors that "China's nuclear armament" "threatens" Japan; this is complete nonsense. The obvious fact is that U.S. imperialism once dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese soil, causing great disaster to the Japanese people. Now the U.S. is transporting nuclear weapons into Japan, turning Japan into a nuclear war base. The nuclear threat to Japan does not come from elsewhere, but precisely from U.S. imperialism. Is there any doubt about this?

    As for the Chinese people possessing nuclear weapons, it is entirely for the defense against U.S. imperialism's nuclear war of aggression. The Chinese government has long declared to the world that China will never, under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons. China demands the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The Chinese people's possession of nuclear weapons is precisely to break the U.S. imperialist nuclear monopoly, smash U.S. imperialist nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, and pave the way for the final elimination of nuclear weapons. This is a major contribution to peace in Asia and the world. Peace-loving Japanese people and all Japanese people who cherish national interests should only be glad that socialist China possesses nuclear weapons. Obviously, the Sato government's clamor about "China's nuclear threat" is merely serving U.S. imperialism's nuclear war plans.

    To put it bluntly, the so-called U.S. "nuclear protection" for Japan is to tie Japan more tightly to the U.S. nuclear war chariot, turning Japanese territory into a warehouse and launch pad for U.S. nuclear weapons. In fact, Japan has long become a U.S. imperialist nuclear war base. U.S. imperialism has already stored nuclear weapons on Japanese soil, and U.S. nuclear submarines have entered Japanese ports eight times. Now, the Sato government openly declares that Japan is placed under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" in an attempt to legitimize Japan as a U.S. imperialist nuclear war base, so that U.S. imperialism can more freely and in greater quantities transport nuclear weapons into Japan in the future, and point the spearhead at China and Asian countries.

    However, the Sato government incorporating Japan into the U.S. imperialist "nuclear strategy system" can only drag the Japanese nation into the abyss of dangerous disaster. Not only can the U.S. "nuclear protection" not "protect" Japan, but on the contrary, when U.S. imperialism launches a nuclear war in Asia, Japan will be involuntarily drawn in, incurring heavy consequences. The Japanese people will never allow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to use Japanese territory to launch a nuclear war. The Asian people and the people of the world will not agree either. If the Japanese militarists are obsessed with their course, and try to lead Japan onto the path of nuclear war, the result can only be lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet; there will be no other outcome.

    佐藤政府和“核保护伞”
    本报评论员
    日本佐藤政府最近公开声称，日本是在美国的“核保护伞之下”，日美“安全条约”中“当然包括”美国以核武器“防卫”日本；叫嚷日本已经加入了美国的“核战略体制”。这再一次暴露了佐藤政府甘心充当美帝国主义侵略工具的丑恶面目。
    日本军国主义正在加速复活。佐藤上台以后，不仅拼命加强常规军事力量，而且还力图依靠美帝国主义来染指核武器，为日本军国主义核武装作准备。佐藤政府在“日韩条约”签订之后毫不隐讳地说：日本拥有核武器“未必是违反宪法的”。佐藤政府公然宣布日本在美国的“核保护伞之下”，究竟是什么涵义，也就不言而喻了。
    试问，是谁在用核武器威胁着日本，以致佐藤之流有必要寻求“核保护”呢？佐藤政府扬言什么“中国的核武装”“威胁”了日本，这完全是胡说八道。明摆的事实是，美帝国主义曾经把两颗原子弹扔在日本的土地上，使日本人民遭到了极大的灾害。现在美国又把核武器运进日本，把日本当作核战争基地。对于日本的核威胁，不是来自别处，而恰恰是来自美帝国主义，这难道还有什么疑问吗？
    至于中国人民掌握核武器，则完全是为了防御美帝国主义的核侵略战争。中国政府早就向全世界宣布，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。中国要求全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器。中国人民有了核武器，正是为了打破美帝国主义的核垄断，粉碎美帝国主义的核讹诈和核威胁，并为最后消灭核武器开辟道路。这是对亚洲和世界和平的重大贡献。热爱和平的日本人民和一切珍视民族利益的日本人士，只有为社会主义中国拥有核武器而感到高兴。很显然，佐藤政府所以叫嚷“中国核威胁”，不过是为美帝国主义的核战争计划效劳。
    说穿了，所谓美国对日本的“核保护”，就是要把日本更紧地绑在美国的核战车上，使日本的国土成为美国的核武器的仓库和发射台。事实上，日本早已变成了美帝国主义的核战争基地。美帝国主义在日本的国土上已经储放了核武器，美国的核潜艇也先后八次开入日本港口。现在，佐藤政府公开宣布日本置于美国的“核保护伞之下”，是企图使日本作为美帝国主义的核战争基地合法化，使美帝国主义今后可以更自由地、更大量地把核武器运进日本，并把矛头指向中国和亚洲各国。
    但是，佐藤政府把日本纳入美帝国主义的“核战略体制”，只能把日本民族拖入危险的灾难的深渊。不但美国的“核保护”“保护”不了日本，相反地当美帝国主义在亚洲发动核战争的时候，日本就要不由自主地被卷进去，招致惨重的后果。日本人民决不会允许美日反动派利用日本的土地发动核战争。亚洲人民和全世界人民也决不会答应。如果日本军国主义者执迷不悟，要把日本引上核战争的道路，结果只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，不可能有别的下场。
