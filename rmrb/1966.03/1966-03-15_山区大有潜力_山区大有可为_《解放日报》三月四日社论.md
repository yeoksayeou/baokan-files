    From the report published in today's edition of this newspaper about Leping County, Jiangxi Province, adopting various forms to develop and construct mountainous areas, we can see that highways have been built on the peaks of high mountains, and state-owned reclamation farms have been established; in the remote, sparsely populated deep mountain valleys, new socialist mountain villages have emerged, with the presence of smoke everywhere; previously bare mountains are being covered with new greenery; previously barren and infertile fields are being reclaimed and becoming fertile; the natural resources of the mountains are being developed and utilized; soil erosion in the mountains is being gradually controlled; and agricultural production in the mountains has seen significant development. This is truly a beautiful landscape painting filled with the spirit of the socialist era, which is exciting to read.
    East China is a region with many mountains. The area of mountainous and hilly regions accounts for about half of the total area of the entire region. The proportion of mountainous areas in the provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi is even greater, with some having "seven parts mountains, one part water, and two parts farmland," and others having "six parts mountains, one part water, two parts farmland, and one part roads and villages." Therefore, mountainous areas occupy an extremely important position in the socialist construction of the East China region. The state of production, construction, and work in the mountainous areas has a significant impact on the development of the entire region's socialist construction.
    The mountainous areas of East China are not only vast but also rich in resources. In particular, many mountainous areas in the south of the Yangtze River have always been important bases for timber and economic forests, and some mountainous areas are also bases for commodity grain production and draught animal production. However, a large amount of barren mountains in the region suitable for afforestation have not been planted with trees. If these barren mountains are all afforested, with bamboo and wood becoming forests, tung and tallow trees forming continuous patches, mulberry and tea trees covering the slopes, and pear and jujube trees everywhere, then not only will it be possible to provide the country with more and more timber and bamboo, but also to provide more and more industrial raw materials, export goods, and articles for people's daily use. A considerable amount of low-yield fields in the mountainous areas of the region have not been transformed, and the overall level of grain production is still stable but not high. If some basic farmland construction is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and improvements are made in farming techniques, then low-yield fields can be gradually transformed into high-yield fields, greatly improving the level of grain production in the mountainous areas. Many grasslands in the mountainous areas of the region have not been used to develop animal husbandry. Fully utilizing these grasslands to raise cattle, pigs, and sheep will not only provide more animal power and fertilizer for agricultural production but also greatly increase the supply of livestock products. More prominently, there are still many remote mountainous areas in the region with inconvenient transportation and sparse populations, where many natural forest product resources have not been developed, and many wild plants and a wide variety of mountain specialties have not been fully utilized. The development and utilization of all these resources will provide a large amount of wealth for socialist construction.
    Further developing and constructing mountainous areas is not only conducive to the prosperity of the mountain economy but also conducive to promoting the development of agricultural production in the plains. This is because mountainous areas are the rear of the plains and the upper reaches of rivers. Green mountains and clear waters are the basic conditions for ensuring stable and high agricultural production; poor mountains and bad waters are the main sources of droughts and floods. In the struggle to transform nature, mountain management, water management, and field management are closely linked, and mountain management is fundamental. Only by managing the mountains well, with trees, forests, and grass on the mountains, can we effectively regulate the climate, conserve water sources, and prevent mountain floods and soil erosion. Conversely, if the mountains are barren and the ridges are bald, once mountain floods break out, the floods will carry mud and sand, destroying crops and farmland; encountering drought will lead to severe water shortages. The mountainous people say: "An inch of trees moistens a tenth of an acre of land," "Mountains are stripped bare, fields become streams," "Mountains are bare, fields are barren," which are valuable experiences gained from long-term practice, and also an vivid generalization of the inherent connection between mountains, water, and fields. Therefore, further developing and constructing mountainous areas is greatly beneficial to the plains and is a fundamental construction for our development of agricultural production.
    Further developing and constructing mountainous areas is the urgent demand of the vast mountainous people. Many mountainous areas in East China were old revolutionary base areas during the domestic revolutionary war, the war of resistance against Japan, and the liberation war. The masses there have a relatively high political consciousness and a deep feeling for the Party. During the arduous revolutionary war years, they provided manpower and food to support the revolutionary war, making tremendous contributions. Since liberation, they have also provided great support for the country's socialist construction. However, because many places have not paid enough attention to work in mountainous areas in recent years, the development of various production and construction projects in mountainous areas has been relatively slow, and the material and cultural level of the vast mountainous people is still relatively low. At present, they are eagerly demanding to rapidly change the poor and blank face of the mountainous areas and build a prosperous and rich socialist new mountainous area with lush forests and abundant grain. They want the mountainous areas to play a greater role in supporting the plains and the coast in future socialist construction. To this end, we should use the greatest mass viewpoint and the greatest political enthusiasm to look at the issue of further developing and constructing mountainous areas, and we should put strengthening work in mountainous areas on the agenda without delay and earnestly strengthen the Party's leadership over work in mountainous areas.
    Some comrades now have insufficient understanding of the importance of further developing and constructing mountainous areas. They only pay attention to grasping the plains and do not pay attention to grasping the mountainous areas. This is a kind of one-sidedness that must be overcome in leadership work. Work in the plains should be valued, and leadership over work in the plains should continue to be strengthened in the future. However, socialist construction is a whole. We must not only build the plains well but also build the mountainous areas well; the plains have irreplaceable roles in the mountainous areas, and the mountainous areas also have irreplaceable roles in the plains; neither can be neglected. What's more, the mountainous areas and the plains are interdependent and mutually promote each other. The development of mountainous construction can not only create important conditions for the stable and high production of agricultural production in the plains, but also provide many important means of production for agricultural production. If the level of grain production in the mountainous areas is greatly improved, and the production of woody grain, woody oil, and fiber crops in the mountainous areas is further developed, it can also greatly alleviate the contradiction between grain crops and economic crops competing for land, fertilizer, and labor in the plains, becoming a powerful support for the plains. Therefore, in all places with mountains, Party organizations must establish an overall perspective, grasping both the plains and the mountains. Those who did not pay attention to the mountains in the past should pay attention to them in the future; those who did not pay enough attention to them in the past should pay serious attention to them in the future. In some places that are purely mountainous or mainly mountainous, strengthening work in mountainous areas should be placed in the most important position.
    Some comrades believe that the conditions in the mountainous areas are relatively poor in many aspects, and even if great efforts are spent to grasp them, it is difficult to change the situation. This is an ideological obstacle that must be resolutely overcome. It should be admitted that due to long-term historical reasons, the objective conditions for developing production in some mountainous areas are worse than those in the plains. However, this issue must not be viewed from a static, metaphysical perspective. Many famous agricultural advanced units in East China, such as the Xiadingjia Brigade in Shandong, the Dagaowu Brigade and Maoping Brigade in Zhejiang, the Hetang Reclamation Farm in Jiangxi, and the Pingzhai Brigade in Fujian, etc., all came from mountainous areas. The original natural conditions and production conditions of these advanced units were relatively poor, but after unremitting hard struggle, haven't they all changed their past backward appearance and established a thriving socialist mountainous economy? Precisely because some mountainous areas are currently relatively backward in some aspects, we need to strengthen our work even more. Mountainous construction is a matter of construction for one generation and benefits for several generations. For the sake of the country's long-term interests and the happiness of future generations, we should further vigorously grasp the construction of mountainous areas. We should have such revolutionary spirit and revolutionary vision.
    Some comrades think that mountainous areas are bitter, and therefore are afraid to go to mountainous areas to work. This is a reflection of a lack of revolutionary ideals and revolutionary ambition. We are engaged in revolution and construction, and every step requires hard work. Further developing and constructing mountainous areas requires fighting with mountains, fighting with water, fighting with fields, needing to drive away bears and leopards, venture into rapids and dangerous shoals, and climb towering mountains and ridges. Of course, it is an arduous revolutionary struggle. The question is how we understand this hardship and treat this hardship. Is it to not be afraid of hardship for the sake of revolution and to take great suffering as joy, or is it to avoid revolutionary struggle for fear of hardship? In 1957, Jiangxi Province had 50,000 cadres who made the great ambition of "Foolish Old Man," embraced revolutionary passion, cut through thorns and thistles, and embarked on the journey of developing and constructing new socialist mountainous areas. After several years of hard struggle, they have consolidated and established more than 200 state-owned reclamation farms in the province, which can produce hundreds of millions of catties of grain every year, and also manage large areas of mountains. Moreover, many mountainous areas have been connected by highways, with schools, hospitals, electric lights, and telephones, and the masses are cheering: "Socialism has gone up the mountain!" The revolutionary spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship of Jiangxi cadres going to the mountains and the revolutionary ambition of "ten thousand rivers and thousands of mountains are nothing" have set a good example for us.
    Mountainous areas are a vast world. There is great potential and great promise there. Further developing and constructing mountainous areas is an important part of the great socialist construction undertaking, an important aspect of the struggle to realize my country's third five-year plan, and has great economic significance and great political significance. We should earnestly strengthen the Party's leadership over work in mountainous areas, achieve ideological ascent, cadre ascent, and work ascent, plant the red flag of socialist construction all over the thousands of mountains and ridges, and make Wuyi Mountain and Tianmu Mountain offer more treasures, and make Jinggang Mountain and Dabie Mountain make new and greater contributions to the revolution in the new historical period!

    山区大有潜力　山区大有可为
    《解放日报》三月四日社论
    从今天本报发表的江西省乐平县采取多种形式开发和建设山区的报道里，可以看到，在那高山之巅，已经修通了公路，办起了全民所有制的垦殖场；在那荒无人烟的深山冷坞里，已经出现了一座座社会主义的新山村，烟火处处；原来光秃秃的山岭正在披上新绿；原来荒僻瘦瘠的田地正在垦熟变肥；山区的自然资源正在被开发利用；山区的水土流失正在被逐步控制；山区的农业生产已经有了显著的发展。这真是一幅美丽的充满了社会主义时代精神的山水画，读了令人兴奋。
    华东是一个多山的地区，山区加上丘陵地区的面积，约占全区总面积的一半左右。福建、浙江、江西三省山区的比重还要大一些，有的是“七山一水二分田”，有的是“六山一水二分田，一分道路和庄园”。所以，山区在华东地区的社会主义建设中占着极为重要的位置。山区的生产如何，建设如何，工作如何，对全区社会主义建设事业的发展有着重大的影响。
    华东的山区，不仅地方广阔，而且资源十分丰富。特别是江南许多山区，历来是重要的用材林基地和经济林基地，有一些山区也是商品粮生产基地和耕畜生产基地。可是，全区的山区也还有大量适宜于营林的荒山没有种上树。把这些荒山都绿化起来，使之竹木成林，桐桕连片，桑茶满坡，梨枣遍地，那就不仅能够为国家提供越来越多的木材、竹子，而且可以提供越来越多的工业原料、出口物资和人民生活用品。全区的山区还有相当数量的低产田没有得到改造，粮食生产水平总的来说还是稳而不高。有计划有步骤地进行一些农田基本建设，同时在耕作技术等方面加以改进，那就可以逐步变低产为高产，大大提高山区的粮食生产水平。全区的山区还有不少草场没有用来发展畜牧业。充分利用这些草场养牛，养猪，养羊，那就不仅能够为农业生产提供更多的畜力和肥料，而且可以大大增加畜产品的供应。更突出的是，全区还有不少交通不便、人烟稀少的深山区，那里有许多天然的林产品资源还没有被开发，有许多野生植物以及多种多样的山货特产还没有被充分利用。所有这些资源的开发和利用，都将为社会主义建设提供大量的财富。
    进一步开发和建设山区，不仅有利于山区经济的繁荣，也有利于促进平原地区农业生产的发展。这是因为，山区是平原的后方，是江河的上游。青山绿水，是保证农业稳产高产的基本条件；穷山恶水，是旱涝灾害的主要根源。在改造自然的斗争中，治山治水治田是密切联系的，治山又是根本。只有把山治好，山上有树有林有草，才能有效地调节气候，涵养水源，防止山洪暴发和水土流失。反之，如果山是荒山，岭是秃岭，一旦山洪暴发，洪水就会挟泥沙俱下，既冲毁庄稼，又冲毁农田；遇到干旱又会严重缺水。山区群众说：“寸树斗水丈地湿”，“山剥皮，田变溪”，“山上光，田里荒”，就是从长期实践中得出来的宝贵体验，也是对山水田之间内在联系的形象概括。所以，进一步开发和建设山区，大有利于平原，是我们发展农业生产的一项根本建设。
    进一步开发和建设山区，是广大山区人民的迫切要求。华东的许多山区，在国内革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争时期，都是革命的老根据地。那里的广大群众政治觉悟比较高，对党有着深厚的感情。在艰苦的革命战争年代里，他们出人出粮，支援革命战争，曾经作出过巨大的贡献。解放以来，他们对国家的社会主义建设也提供了巨大的支援。但是，由于近些年来不少地方对山区工作注意不够，山区各项生产建设的发展比较缓慢，广大山区人民的物质文化水平也还是比较低的。目前，他们迫切要求迅速改变山区一穷二白的面貌，建设林茂粮丰、繁荣富裕的巩固的社会主义新山区。使山区在今后的社会主义建设中，发挥更大的支援平原、支援沿海的作用。为此，我们应该用最大的群众观点，最大的政治热情，来看待进一步开发和建设山区的问题，应该刻不容缓地把加强山区工作提到议事日程上来，切实地加强党对山区工作的领导。
    现在有一些同志对进一步开发和建设山区的重要性认识不足。他们只重视抓平原，不重视抓山区。这是领导工作中必须克服的一种片面性。平原的工作是应该重视的，今后还要继续加强对平原工作的领导，但是，社会主义建设事业是一个整体。我们既要建设好平原，也要建设好山区；平原有山区不能代替的作用，山区也有平原不能代替的作用；两者不可偏废。何况，山区和平原是互相依存、互相促进的。山区建设的发展，不仅可以为平原地区农业生产的稳产高产创造重要的条件，还可以给农业生产提供许多重要的生产资料。如果把山区的粮食生产水平大大地提高一步，再把山区木本粮食、木本油料、纤维作物的生产进一步发展起来，还可以大大缓和平原地区粮食作物和经济作物争地争肥争劳力的矛盾，成为对平原的一种强有力的支援。所以，所有有山的地方，党组织必须树立全面观点，一手抓平原，一手抓山区。过去不重视山区的，今后应该重视起来；过去不够重视的，今后应该认真重视。有些地方属于纯山区或者主要是山区，更要把加强山区工作放在首要的位置上。
    有的同志认为山区在许多方面条件比较差，即使花大力气去抓，也难以改变面貌。这是必须坚决克服的一个思想障碍。应该承认，由于长期的历史的原因，有些山区发展生产的客观条件是要比平原差一些。但是，看待这个问题，决不能持静止的形而上学的观点。华东地区许多著名的农业先进单位，例如山东的下丁家大队，浙江的大高庑大队、茆坪大队，江西的荷塘垦殖场，福建的坪寨大队等等，都出在山区。这些先进单位原来的自然条件和生产条件都比较差，经过不懈的艰苦斗争，现在不是都已改变了昔日的落后面貌，建立了欣欣向荣的社会主义山区经济了吗？正因为有些山区目前在有些方面还比较落后，就更需要我们去加强工作。山区建设是一代建设、几代得益的事情。为了祖国的千秋大业，为了子孙万代的幸福，我们应该进一步大抓山区的建设。我们应该有这样的革命气魄和革命胸怀。
    有些同志认为山区苦，因而怕到山区去工作。这是缺乏革命理想和革命志气的反映。我们干革命，搞建设，每一步都要付出艰辛的劳动。进一步开发和建设山区，需要与山斗争，与水斗争，与田斗争，需要驱熊罴虎豹，闯急流险滩，攀崇山峻岭，当然是一场艰苦的革命斗争。问题是我们怎样认识这种艰苦，对待这种艰苦。是为了革命不怕吃苦，并且以吃大苦为乐，还是为了怕吃苦而逃避革命斗争。江西省在一九五七年时，就有五万干部立下“愚公”大志，怀抱革命激情，披荆斩棘，踏上了开发和建设社会主义新山区的征途。经过几年的艰苦斗争，他们已经在全省巩固地建立起二百多个全民所有制的垦殖场，每年可以生产几亿斤粮食，还管理着大片的山场，而且使许多山区通了公路，有了学校医院、电灯电话，群众在欢呼：“社会主义上了山！”江西干部上山艰苦创业的革命精神和“万水千山只等闲”的革命志气，给我们树立了良好的榜样。
    山区，是一个广阔的天地。那里大有潜力，大有可为。进一步开发和建设山区，是伟大的社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分，是为实现我国第三个五年计划而斗争的一个重要方面，有极大的经济意义，也有极大的政治意义。我们应该切实加强党对山区工作的领导，做到思想上山、干部上山、工作上山，把社会主义建设红旗插遍千山万岭，要武夷山、天目山奉献出更多的宝藏，要井冈山、大别山在新的历史时期为革命作出新的更大的贡献！
