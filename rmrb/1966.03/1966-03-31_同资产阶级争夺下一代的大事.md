    Today, this newspaper publishes the experience of Taiyuan City in running TV work-study middle schools (see pages 4 and 5). We will also successively publish the experience of Mudanjiang City in establishing youth centers, and the experience of Changchun City in systematically guiding urban youth to the countryside. The specific practices of these three cities are different, but they have one thing in common. That is, under the leadership of the Party, they highlight politics, proceed from competing with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, and cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture to understand and solve the problem of managing and educating urban out-of-school youth. These three cities implement the practice of the whole Party taking action, relying on the masses, and promoting the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. They adopt diverse forms and methods to organize out-of-school youth and those who do not yet have the conditions for employment, to study Chairman Mao’s works, learn cultural and scientific knowledge and production skills, and participate in activities within their capabilities as well as various social activities. This can cultivate this group of urban youth into a revolutionary new generation and prepare them for their future participation in socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Youth are our future and the hope of the revolution. Our Party and state have always been concerned about the healthy growth of youth and have consistently attached importance to the work of cultivating and educating them. Since the founding of New China, with the continuous upsurge of the national economy, the cause of education has also developed vigorously. In recent years, two education systems have been actively promoted in urban and rural areas. While running full-time schools well, a large number of part-work and part-study, part-farming and part-study schools have been established; various spare-time schools, correspondence schools, etc., have also been established, which has given young people more opportunities to enroll and study. However, with the continuous development of production, the gradual improvement of people's lives, and the increasing cultural demands of the people, it is still not possible to meet the requirements of all young people to enroll and study due to various other reasons. Among the out-of-school youth, most are young, lack the ability to live independently, do not have the skills of production labor, and cannot participate in production labor. In large, medium, and small cities with a considerable concentration of population, the problem of enrolling and studying for this part of the youth, that is, the problem of managing and educating them, should and can be solved earlier.
    Organizing all urban youth, managing and educating them well, is a major event for us to compete with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, and it is a major event for cultivating a new type of laborers who can engage in both physical and mental labor. This is a serious and complex class struggle that runs through the entire socialist period.
    We must never ignore the basic fact that in the socialist period, there are classes and class struggles, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Our youth are growing up in an environment of intense and complex class struggle. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are fighting for youth. The proletariat cares for and educates them with the greatest enthusiasm, and the bourgeoisie and the habits of the old society are also trying their best to influence them. Imperialism has also placed its hope of "peaceful evolution" on our next generation. Our youth can embark on the socialist road and become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; they may also embark on the capitalist and revisionist road and become successors to the bourgeoisie. The outcome of this struggle is related to the question of whether our revolutionary cause has successors and whether our revolutionary red flag will never change color. The overthrown bourgeoisie and other reactionary classes are not reconciled to their demise. They are spare no effort from all aspects to exert influence on young people with decadent and reactionary things, and attempt to realize their conspiracy of "peaceful evolution" in our descendants. Youth idling in society are the key targets of the bourgeoisie. Because of the lack of organized management and education for these young people, the bourgeoisie and the habits of the old society have more opportunities to influence them. Facts have proved that the ideological essence of the vast majority of these young people is good, and they have a revolutionary aspiration to improve; under the conditions of a strong proletarian dictatorship, as long as we organize them and manage and educate them properly, we can make them a positive force for the revolution: going to the countryside, they can become good farmers; going to the factory, they can become good workers; going to the store, they can become good shop assistants; going to the army, they can become good soldiers. If we do not manage and educate them, then the bourgeoisie will take advantage of the opportunity to seduce, corrupt and paralyze them, lead them astray, and turn them into negative factors in society. The seriousness of the problem lies here.
    Managing and educating urban youth well is an important educational task and, even more, a major and serious political task. The initial experiences of Taiyuan, Mudanjiang, and Changchun show that to manage and educate these young people well, first of all, there must be correct guiding ideology and a clear orientation in running schools. We actively create various learning conditions for these urban youth, not simply to solve their problem of entering higher schools, nor simply to solve their employment problem, but to be fully responsible for our revolutionary descendants from the height of the long-term interests of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take class struggle and the two-road struggle as the key link, and cultivate youth into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. We must educate them to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and we must constantly conduct class education on them so that they understand why they should study politics, cultural and scientific knowledge, and production labor skills, and how they can serve the people wholeheartedly after they have learned them well. How to run schools, what to teach, how to teach, and so on should all be subordinate to this fundamental idea. If we want to compete with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, we must use such schools and educational units to educate the children of the working people, and also educate the youth from exploiting class families, and truly win this part of the youth over to serving the proletarian revolutionary cause, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    The situations in Taiyuan, Mudanjiang, and Changchun also show that to run such schools and educational units, it is necessary to go through a series of sharp ideological struggles. It is necessary to resolutely and constantly oppose the bourgeois educational thought of education for the sake of education, and to implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Students should be tempered in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. It is necessary to oppose one-sided emphasis on learning culture and professional skills and one-sided pursuit of entering higher schools. It is necessary to break the old framework, oppose the so-called "regularization" and "uniformity" and other erroneous guiding ideologies, carry forward the revolutionary tradition of self-reliance and hard struggle, adapt to local conditions, make use of simple resources, and adopt diverse methods according to the different situations and objective needs of young people to manage and educate all young people well. We firmly believe that with Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon, we will have the correct direction, and we can run such schools and educational units in accordance with this direction, and cultivate youth into a new generation of socialism. Facts have proved that those who have resolutely done so have achieved remarkable results. In the early stage of its establishment, the Mudanjiang Youth Center once only satisfied the young people's desire to enter higher schools, focusing on cramming culture, or only paying attention to arranging employment. As a result, some people still complained, picked and chose jobs, and preferred easy jobs to hard ones. Later, they highlighted politics and grasped hard the study of Chairman Mao's works, which enabled the youth to have the correct direction, understand the principles of revolution, and have the enthusiasm and creativity to contribute to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. This experience and lesson should be remembered by all educators.
    The guiding principle for running schools and educational units that manage and educate these young people should mainly be oriented towards the countryside, and cultivate labor reserve forces for the countryside. All management and education work in these schools and educational units should be arranged according to the requirements of being oriented towards the countryside. After young people go to the mountains and the countryside, the Party and League organizations at all levels in the countryside, and the cadres of the communes and teams, should enthusiastically care for their growth, properly arrange their production and life, and strengthen their management and education; the relevant units in the cities should still serve as their rear, continue to care for them, support them, and be responsible for them to the end. It should be seen that organizing all the out-of-school youth in the city, educating them, and systematically transferring them to the countryside is not only a major event in cultivating and educating the new generation, but also of great political significance for building a socialist new countryside and for gradually narrowing the difference between mental and physical labor.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Youth is the most active and energetic part of the entire social force. They are the most willing to learn and the least conservative in their thinking, especially in the socialist era." Educating the younger generation is a major task of strategic significance for our Party and state. Organizing all out-of-school youth in the city, managing and educating them well, and arranging employment for them is a very important and complex task. This work involves education, labor, planning, industry, agriculture, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, street organizations and other relevant departments. The Party should take charge, the Communist Youth League should take charge, the relevant government departments should take charge, and mass organizations and schools should also take charge. Only under the unified leadership of the Party, with all relevant departments dividing their responsibilities, actively cooperating, and relying on the strength of the masses, can this work be done well. The key to the success of Taiyuan, Mudanjiang, and Changchun in the management and education of young people lies in the fact that the local Party committees personally grasped this matter and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of all sectors of society. Many cities are currently carrying out this work, and I believe there must be many good experiences, and I hope to summarize and improve them, and create better experiences. All cities across the country must attach great importance to this issue, and effectively manage and educate young people well, and achieve a complete victory in the struggle with the bourgeoisie for the younger generation.

### 同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事

    同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事
    今天本报发表了太原市举办电视工读中学的经验（见第四、五版），接着还要陆续刊登牡丹江市创办青少年之家的经验，长春市有计划地把城市青少年导向农村的经验。这三个城市的具体做法各不一样，但有一个共同点。这就是，在党的领导下，突出政治，从同资产阶级争夺下一代出发，从培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者出发，来认识和解决管好教好城市未升学青少年的问题。这三个市实行全党动手，依靠群众，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，采取多种多样的形式和办法，把未升学的和暂时还不具备就业条件的青少年组织起来，学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习文化科学知识和生产劳动技能，参加力所能及的生产劳动和各种社会活动。这就能够培养这一部分城市青少年成为革命的新一代，为他们将来参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设准备了条件。
    青少年是我们的未来，是革命的希望。我们党和国家向来是关心青少年的健康成长的，是一贯重视青少年的培养教育工作的。新中国建国以来，随着国民经济的不断高涨，教育事业也有了蓬勃的发展。近几年来，在城乡积极推行两种教育制度，在办好全日制学校的同时，举办了大批半工半读半农半读的学校；还举办了各种业余学校、函授学校等，这就使青少年有了更多的入学读书的机会。但是，随着生产的不断发展，人民生活的逐步改善，人民群众对文化要求的日益增长，同时由于其他种种原因，仍然不能满足全部青少年入学读书的要求。在未升学的青少年中，大部分年龄较小，缺乏独立生活的能力，没有生产劳动的技能，还不能参加生产劳动。在人口相当集中的大中小城市，对于这一部分青少年入学读书、也就是对他们管理教育的问题，应当而且可以早些解决。
    把城市青少年全部组织起来，管好教好，是我们同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事，是培养既能从事体力劳动又能从事脑力劳动的新型劳动者的大事。这是贯串整个社会主义时期的一场严重的复杂的阶级斗争。
    我们千万不能忽视这样一个基本事实：在社会主义时期，存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们的青少年是在激烈的复杂的阶级斗争的环境里成长的。无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级正在争夺青少年。无产阶级以最大的热情关怀和教育他们，资产阶级和旧社会习惯势力也在竭力影响他们。帝国主义也把“和平演变”的希望寄托在我们下一代的身上。我们的青少年可以走上社会主义道路，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人；也可能走上资本主义、修正主义道路，成为资产阶级的接班人。这个斗争的结局，关系到我们的革命事业是不是后继有人的问题，关系到我们的革命红旗是不是永不变颜色的问题。被推翻的资产阶级和其他反动阶级是不甘心自己的灭亡的，他们正在不遗余力地从各个方面用陈腐的、反动的东西对青少年施加影响，企图在我们后代身上实现他们的“和平演变”的阴谋。闲散在社会上的青少年，正是资产阶级重点进攻的对象。因为对这些青少年缺乏有组织的管理和教育，就使资产阶级和旧社会的习惯势力有更多的机会对他们施加影响。事实证明，这些青少年，绝大多数人的思想本质是好的，有革命上进心；在强大的无产阶级专政的条件下，我们只要把他们组织起来，管理教育得法，就可以使他们成为革命的积极力量：到农村去，可以成为好农民；到工厂去，可以成为好工人；到商店去，可以成为好店员；到部队去，可以成为好战士。如果我们不去管理教育他们，那么资产阶级就会乘虚而入，对他们进行引诱、腐蚀和麻醉，把他们引入歧途，变成社会上的消极的因素。问题的严重性就在这里。
    管好教好城市青少年，是一项重要的教育任务，更是一项重大的、严肃的政治任务。太原、牡丹江和长春三个市的初步经验说明，要管好教好这些青少年，首先要有正确的指导思想和明确的办学方向。我们积极地为这些城市青少年创造各种学习条件，不是单纯地为了解决他们的升学问题，也不是单纯地为了解决他们的就业问题，而是站在无产阶级革命事业的长远利益的高度，对我们的革命后代全面负责的问题。我们要遵照毛泽东同志的教导，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，培养青少年成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。要教育他们认真学习毛泽东同志著作，要对他们经常进行阶级教育，使他们懂得为什么要学习政治、学习文化科学知识和生产劳动技能，学好了又如何全心全意地为人民服务。学校怎样办，教什么，怎样教等等问题，都应该服从这个根本思想。我们要同资产阶级争夺下一代，就要通过这样的学校和教育单位，去教育劳动人民的子女，也教育出身于剥削阶级家庭的青少年，真正把这一部分青少年争取到为无产阶级革命事业服务，为中国人民和世界人民服务这一方面来。
    太原、牡丹江和长春三个城市的情况还说明，要办这样的学校和教育单位，必然要经过一系列尖锐的思想斗争。要坚决地、不断地反对为教育而教育的资产阶级办学思想，要贯彻执行教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。要让学生在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中进行锻炼。要反对片面强调学习文化、业务和片面追求升学。要打破旧框框，反对所谓“正规化”、“一律化”等错误的指导思想，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命传统，因地制宜，因陋就简，针对青少年的不同情况和客观需要，采取多种多样的办法，把青少年统统管好教好。我们坚信，有了毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，就有了正确的方向，就可以按照这个方向办好这样的学校和教育单位，把青少年培养成为社会主义的新一代。事实证明，凡是坚决这样做了的，就能收到显著的效果。牡丹江市青少年之家，在创办初期，曾经一度只是满足青少年的升学愿望，大抓补习文化，或者只注意安排就业，结果仍然有人发怨言，挑肥拣瘦，拈轻怕重。后来，他们突出了政治，狠抓毛泽东同志著作的学习，就使青少年有了正确的方向，懂得了革命的道理，有了为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献力量的积极性和创造性。这一经验教训，对于所有的教育工作者来说，都是应当记取的。
    管理教育这些青少年的学校和教育单位的办学方针，主要应该面向农村，为农村培养劳动后备力量。这类学校和教育单位的一切管理和教育工作，都应该根据面向农村的要求进行安排。青少年上山下乡之后，农村的各级党、团组织和社、队干部，要热情地关怀他们的成长，妥善地安排好他们的生产和生活，加强对他们的管理教育；城市的有关单位仍然要作为他们的后方，继续关心他们，支援他们，对他们负责到底。应该看到，把城市中未升学的青少年统统组织起来，进行教育，并且有计划地把他们输送到农村，这不仅是培养教育新一代的大事，而且对于建设社会主义新农村，对于逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，都有重要的政治意义。
    毛泽东同志说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”教育青少年一代，是我们党和国家的一项具有战略意义的重大任务。把城市未升学的青少年统统组织起来，管好教好，并且安排好就业，这是一项十分重要而又复杂的工作。这项工作，涉及教育、劳动、计划、工业、农业、共青团、妇联、街道组织等有关部门。党应该管，共青团应该管，政府有关部门应该管，群众团体和学校也应该管。只有在党的统一领导下，各有关部门分工负责，积极协作，依靠群众的力量，才能把这项工作办好。太原、牡丹江和长春三个市对青少年的管理教育工作所以做得好，关键就在于当地党委亲自抓了这件事，并且充分调动了社会各方面的积极性。目前许多城市都在进行这项工作，相信一定有不少很好的经验，希望加以总结提高，创造出更好的经验。全国所有的城市一定要十分重视这个问题，切实把青少年管好教好，在同资产阶级争夺青少年一代的斗争中取得彻底的胜利。
