    The Ministry of Culture and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association held a reception tonight at the Great Hall of the People to warmly bid farewell to the Song and Dance Troupe from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Responsible persons from relevant departments, including Yang Xiufeng, Li Chang, Li Qi, and Han Nianlong, along with hundreds of people from the capital's literary and art circles, joined the Vietnamese literary and art fighters at the reception to express their friendship. They sang the song "Liberate the South" together and raised their glasses to congratulate the great victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.
    Li Qi, Vice Minister of Culture, said in his speech at the reception that the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe, following the teachings of President Ho Chi Minh, wholeheartedly devoted themselves to the fiery battle, tightly grasped the literary and artistic weapons in their hands, and depicted the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people defeating U.S. imperialism and praised the great people's war in traditional national forms. Your performances have encouraged the people of our country and established a great heroic image of the Vietnamese people in the hearts of our people.
    Li Qi said that the great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation being waged by the heroic Vietnamese people is not only to defend their motherland but also to defend the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and all oppressed and exploited people in the world. The Chinese people resolutely support the firm position of the Vietnamese people in carrying through the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. No matter what storms and waves may arise, 650 million Chinese people will forever fight alongside the fraternal Vietnamese people until the final victory is won.
    Qu Huy Can, head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe, said in his speech that although the Vietnamese people still face numerous hardships on their path forward, they have firm confidence in defeating the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnamese people's struggle is not only a struggle to defend the independence of their motherland but also a struggle to defend world peace. To defend world peace, we must first defend national independence, and our path of struggle will never change.
    Comrade Qu Huy Can said that in the days of fighting against the fierce enemy, the Vietnamese people deeply appreciate the noble proletarian internationalist feelings of the Chinese Communist Party and government towards the Vietnamese people and deeply appreciate the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people towards the Vietnamese people. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese party and government leaders and the Chinese people for their warm reception of the Song and Dance Troupe.
    Yang Xiufeng, President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, said in his toast, let the people of China and Vietnam join hands even more closely to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. He asked the Vietnamese comrades to convey the Chinese people's high respect to President Ho Chi Minh and other leaders of the Vietnamese Party and government, as well as to the heroic Vietnamese people.
    Also joining the Vietnamese comrades tonight were responsible persons from relevant departments and literary and art circles in the capital, including Shi Huaibi, Fan Jin, Sun Xiaocun, Li Wei, Ren Yinglun, Lü Ji, Dai Ailian, and Ma Sicong.
    Hoang Bac, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, and Le Tung Son, Acting Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation in China, were also invited to attend the reception.
    Literary and art workers from the capital performed Chinese and Vietnamese song and dance programs at the reception, including "Fighting Vietnam," "Vietnam-China," "Ready to Fight at Any Time," "U.S. Imperialism Will Be Defeated, Vietnam Will Win," excerpts from "Nguyen Van Troi in Prison," and "Night Raid."
