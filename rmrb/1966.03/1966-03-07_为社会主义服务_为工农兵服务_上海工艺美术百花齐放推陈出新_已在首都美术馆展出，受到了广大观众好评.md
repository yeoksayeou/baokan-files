    Serving Socialism, Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Shanghai Arts and Crafts Flourish and Innovate
    Exhibited at the National Art Museum, Receiving High Praise from Audiences
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 5th) The Shanghai Arts and Crafts Exhibition opened at the Beijing Art Museum on March 6th.
    This exhibition showcases the new achievements of Shanghai arts and crafts workers, under the leadership of the Party, in implementing the literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and in serving socialism and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Nearly one thousand arts and crafts items are on display, including more than twenty varieties such as velvet embroidery, jade carving, ivory carving, lacquer carving, wood carving, and bamboo carving. Many exhibits warmly praise the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the socialist era and enthusiastically extol the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This clears away old themes in content and reflects the spirit of the times. With the changes in content, there have also been innovations in form and style.
    The exhibition is divided into three sections: velvet embroidery, carving, and comprehensive display. Velvet embroidery is a part of Shanghai's embroidery craft. Among the exhibits this time are "Chairman Mao's Portrait," "Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan," "Chairman Liu at Anyuan Coal Mine," "Chairman Mao Writing," "Rectification Report," "Eve of the Decisive Battle," "Founding Ceremony," and so on, based on oil paintings and photographs of the same name. This practice of expressing major revolutionary historical themes in arts and crafts is a new gain in the revolutionization of arts and crafts.
    The carving crafts exhibited this time include jade carving, ivory carving, lacquer carving, wood carving, as well as bamboo carving, inkstone carving, porcelain carving, and ivory filigree carving. Among them, the ivory carving "Spring" reflecting the study of Chairman Mao's works by the people of the whole country, the jade carving "Study When You Have Time," as well as the boxwood carving "Jiao Yulu," the jade carving "Daqing People," the mahogany carving "Dazhai People," and the ivory carving "Ten Thousand Ton Hydraulic Press," have all been well received by the audience.
    The giant ivory carving "Glorious Course" comprehensively depicts the revolutionary history of the Chinese people's heroic struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This work weighs seventy-five kilograms and is two point two meters long. This artwork was created by ivory carving artists over two years, using a combination of round carving, relief carving, and openwork carving techniques on an entire elephant tusk. The artists have also made new attempts in combining realistic techniques with traditional decorative techniques.
    The comprehensive display exhibits two types of items: one is practical items such as machine-embroidered, drawn-thread embroidered, and embroidered clothes, pillowcases, tablecloths, and bedsheets; the other is folk arts and crafts such as artificial flowers, velvet birds, lanterns, paper-cuts, dough figurines, and straw braiding. These exhibits have been innovated, developed, and improved in terms of pattern design, needlework application, and modeling.
    Shanghai arts and crafts have a good reputation both domestically and internationally. The personnel in Shanghai's arts and crafts industry will widely solicit opinions through the exhibition in order to further explore how to better adapt to the needs of the vast domestic masses and the international market in the future. This exhibition is sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau.

    为社会主义服务　为工农兵服务
    上海工艺美术百花齐放推陈出新
    已在首都美术馆展出，受到了广大观众好评
    据新华社五日讯　上海市工艺美术展览会三月六日在北京美术馆开幕。
    这个展览会，展出了上海工艺美术工作者在党的领导下，贯彻百花齐放、推陈出新的文艺方针，为社会主义服务、为工农兵服务所取得的新成果。
    这次展出的工艺美术品将近一千件，其中有绒绣、玉雕、牙雕、漆雕、木雕、竹雕等二十多个品种。许多展品，都热情地歌颂了社会主义时代工农兵英雄人物，热情地歌颂了亚非拉人民的革命斗争。这就从内容上清除了陈旧的题材，反映了时代精神。随着内容的变化，在形式风格方面也有所创新。
    展览会分绒绣、雕刻、综合陈列三个部分。绒绣是上海刺绣工艺的一部分。这次展出的展品中，有根据同名油画和摄影制作的“毛主席象”、“毛主席在井冈山”、“刘主席在安源煤矿”、“毛主席在著作”、“整风报告”、“决战前夕”、“开国大典”等等。这种在工艺美术品中表现重大革命历史题材的作法，是工艺美术革命化的新收获。
    这次展出的雕刻工艺品，有玉雕、牙雕、漆雕、木雕，以及竹刻、砚刻、瓷刻、象牙细刻等。其中反映全国人民大学毛主席著作的牙雕“泉”，玉雕“有空就学”，以及黄杨木雕“焦裕禄”，玉雕“大庆人”，红木雕“大寨人”，牙雕“万吨水压机”等等，都受到了观众的好评。
    巨型牙雕“光辉的历程”，概括地表现了中国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下英勇斗争的革命历史。这件作品重七十五公斤，长二点二米。这件艺术品是牙雕艺人们花了两年多的时间，在整支象牙上运用圆雕、浮雕、镂空雕相结合的表现手法创作出来的。艺人们在运用写实手法和传统装饰手法相结合方面，也作了新的尝试。
    综合陈列的展品有两种类型：一是机绣、抽绣、刺绣的衣服、枕套、台布、被单等实用品；一是人造花、绒鸟、灯彩、剪纸、面人、草编等民间工艺美术品。这些展品在图案设计、针法运用和造型等方面，都有所创新、发展和提高。
    上海工艺美术品在国内和国际上都有很好的声誉。上海工艺美术界的人员将通过展览，广泛听取意见，以便今后在很好地适应国内广大群众和国际市场需要方面，做进一步的探索。这个展览会是由上海市手工业管理局主办的。
