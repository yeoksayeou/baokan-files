    Pursuing the Root and Investigating the Core
    A person's revolutionary sentiment comes from close contact with the broad masses of the people, especially workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants. Comrade Qiu Yulang, in studying Comrade Jiao Yulu, focused on examining this point. He said that while he had feelings for the people, mountains, rivers, plants and trees of Sandu, his feelings were not deep or strong enough.
    If one's feelings for the masses are not deep or strong enough, it is not easy to use the revolutionary dialectic of "one divides into two" to look at relevant issues. For example, only seeing the negative side and not seeing the positive side; only seeing unfavorable conditions and not seeing favorable conditions; only seeing unchanging factors and not seeing changeable factors, especially not seeing that people are the most active and positive factor.
    If one's feelings for the masses are not deep or strong enough, one will also lack confidence in victory in changing the face of backward areas, and may even have the idea of not wanting to work in these areas for a long time.
    If one's feelings for the masses are not deep or strong enough, one will often handle work with "selfishness" in mind, and will not have great ambitions, and it will be difficult to do a good job.
    Comrade Qiu Yulang said that with each comparative study and examination, his understanding improved and the root of his thinking was dug deeper. This corresponds to reality.
    In studying the brilliant deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, we need to use the spirit of rectification to seriously compare and examine ourselves, repeatedly study, repeatedly think, and repeatedly analyze, like Comrade Qiu Yulang and some other comrades, to solve problems of ideological understanding and class stand, and be determined to implement it into action. This is the best learning attitude.

    寻根究底
    一个人的革命感情，来自同广大人民，特别是工人和贫农下中农的紧密联系。邱玉郎同志在学习焦裕禄同志的时候，着重检查了这一点。他说，自己对三都的人民和山水草木，虽有感情，但不深不厚。
    对群众的感情不深不厚，就不容易用一分为二的革命辩证法来看有关的问题。例如，只看到消极的一面，看不到积极的一面；只看到不利的条件，看不到有利的条件；只看到不变的因素，看不到可变的因素，特别是看不到人是最活跃、最积极的因素。
    对群众的感情不深不厚，也就会在改变落后地区面貌上缺乏胜利信心，甚至产生不愿长期在这些地区工作的念头。
    对群众的感情不深不厚，往往会带着“私”字来处理工作，就不会有雄心壮志，就难以做好工作。
    邱玉郎同志说，每对照学习检查一次，认识就提高一次，思想根子挖的也更深一层。这是符合实际的。
    在学习焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹中，我们需要象邱玉郎同志和其他一些同志这样，用整风精神认真对照检查，反复学，反复想，反复分析，解决思想认识问题和阶级立场问题，并且决心把它贯彻到行动上去。这是最好的学习态度。
