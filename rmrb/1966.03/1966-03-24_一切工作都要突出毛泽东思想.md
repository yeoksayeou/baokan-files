    The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Requires Cadres Throughout the Province to Adhere to Giving Prominence to Politics, Placing the Study of Chairman Mao's Works in the Forefront, and Regarding the Good Leadership of the Study of Chairman Mao's Works as the Most Important Political Task, So That the Work of the Whole Province Will Advance Along the Correct Political Direction
    (Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 23) The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently demanded that leading cadres at all levels throughout the province adhere to giving prominence to politics, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, and regarding good leadership of the study of Chairman Mao's works as the most important political task; vigorously mobilize workers, peasants, and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works so that Mao Zedong Thought takes root among the masses, in order to correctly implement the Party's policies and ensure that the work of the entire province advances along the correct political direction.
    The meeting held that the movement of cadres and masses in Yunnan Province to study Chairman Mao's works is gradually deepening. Taking a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a hoe to the front line of production is beginning to become the conscious action of the broad masses of cadres. The study of Chairman Mao's works by workers, peasants, and soldiers is also more active and widespread than in the past and has achieved significant results. In discussing the current problems in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the meeting pointed out that some comrades still do not truly understand the importance of giving prominence to politics in all work. The meeting demanded that all parts of the province should conduct an in-depth debate on the relationship between politics and work, politics and production, and politics and technology, in light of the ideological and practical realities of cadres, especially leading cadres. Through discussion, the broad masses of cadres should understand that giving prominence to politics means giving prominence to Mao Zedong Thought. We must always adhere to taking class struggle as the key link; we must take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest instruction for building socialism and moving towards communism; we must adhere to the Party's leadership role, adhere to the mass line and democratic centralism; and adhere to continuous revolution. Establish the view that politics commands everything and raise the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's works.
    The meeting pointed out that giving prominence to politics requires, first and foremost, leading cadres at all levels to place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work and to regard leading cadres and the masses in studying Chairman Mao's works as the most important political task. Leading cadres at all levels, especially those above the county level, must set an example by studying diligently and taking the lead, striving to master Mao Zedong Thought.
    When talking about the need to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the meeting pointed out that "application" is multifaceted, but the most fundamental is to transform thinking, transform the world outlook, continuously revolutionize oneself, and establish the idea of not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, and being wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people. At the same time, we must also learn to use the dialectical viewpoint of "one divides into two" to analyze and deal with problems, understand objective laws, and transform the objective world.
    The meeting also emphasized the need to vigorously mobilize workers, peasants, and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, and make Mao Zedong Thought take root among the masses. We must fully recognize the great significance of the masses studying Chairman Mao's works. Once the masses have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, they can mobilize all positive factors and generate tremendous material strength. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to advocate that cadres and the masses study and apply together. The method of study should be realistic, focused, concise, learn a little and use a little, and not engage in formalism.
    The meeting required Party committees at all levels to widely mobilize the masses to summarize the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, pay attention to discovering and cultivating typical examples, set up models, and conscientiously implement the leadership method of combining general appeals with specific guidance.

    一切工作都要突出毛泽东思想
    中共云南省委要求全省干部坚持突出政治，把学习毛主席著作放在首位，把领导好学习毛主席著作作为头等重要的政治任务，使全省工作沿着正确的政治方向前进
    据新华社昆明二十三日电中共云南省委最近举行的扩大的常委会议，要求全省各级领导干部坚持突出政治，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把领导好学习毛主席著作作为头等重要的政治任务；大力发动工农群众学习毛主席著作，使毛泽东思想在群众中扎根，以便正确贯彻执行党的方针政策，使全省的工作沿着正确的政治方向前进。
    会议认为，云南省广大干部和群众学习毛主席著作的运动正在逐步地深入发展。带上一部《毛泽东选集》、一把锄头到生产第一线去，开始成为广大干部的自觉行动。工农群众学习毛主席著作也比过去更为活跃和广泛，并且收到了显著的效果。会议在讨论当前学习毛主席著作运动存在的问题时指出，当前还有些同志没有真正懂得在一切工作中必须突出政治的重要性。会议要求，全省各地应当结合干部特别是领导干部的思想实际和工作实际，深入地开展一次政治和业务、政治和生产、政治和技术的关系的大辩论。通过讨论，使广大干部懂得突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想。要处处坚持以阶级斗争为纲；要以毛泽东思想作为建设社会主义走向共产主义的最高指示；要坚持党的领导作用、坚持群众路线和民主集中制；坚持不断革命。确立政治统帅一切的观点，提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    会议指出，突出政治，首先要求各级领导干部把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把领导干部、群众学习毛主席著作作为头等重要的政治任务。各级领导干部，特别是县以上干部，都必须以身作则，带头刻苦学习，起模范作用，努力把毛泽东思想学到手。
    会议在谈到必须活学活用毛主席著作的时候指出，“用”是多方面的，但最根本的是改造思想，改造世界观，使自己不断革命化，树立不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的思想。同时，还要学会运用“一分为二”的辩证观点来分析和处理问题，认识客观规律，改造客观世界。
    会议还强调要大力发动工农群众学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装群众，使毛泽东思想在群众中扎根。必须充分认识群众学习毛主席著作的重大意义，群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以调动一切积极因素，产生巨大的物质力量。会议指出，要提倡干部和群众一起学一起用。学习的方法，应当实事求是，少而精，学一点用一点，不搞形式主义。
    会议要求各级党委广泛发动群众总结学习毛主席著作的经验，注意发现和培养典型，树立样板，认真实行一般号召和具体指导相结合的领导方法。
