    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 30th -- Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, arrived in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, by special plane from Lahore at noon on the 30th. Hundreds of thousands of citizens stood along the streets, waving Chinese and Pakistani national flags, playing music, and shouting slogans to warmly welcome the Chinese state leader.

    Welcoming Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese guests at Karachi Airport were Pakistani Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Ataf Hussain, Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Saeed Hasan, Pakistani Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral A. R. Khan, senior local government officials, and notables from all walks of life. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Pakistan also went to the airport to welcome them.

    Thousands of welcomers gathered on the large balcony and square of the airport. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi waved to them, they scattered rose petals at the Chinese guests. Their shouts of "Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi!" "Welcome Vice Premier Chen Yi!" "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!" resounded through the sky.

    On the streets of Karachi, huge portraits of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the national flags of China and Pakistan were erected. Banners hanging on the streets were written in large Chinese and Urdu characters:
    "Welcome the leaders of the great people of a great country," "Long Live People's China," "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship," and "Long Live Afro-Asian Solidarity."

    As the motorcade passed by, girls wearing badges with portraits of Chairman Liu Shaoqi on their chests waved to the Chinese guests. Boy Scouts in uniform blew their horns. Some welcomers held up placards with the words: "The Pakistani people will never forget China's support," "A friend in need is a friend indeed," "Pakistani students oppose American aggression," and "Support the struggle of the Vietnamese freedom fighters."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage received a warm send-off when they left Lahore on the 30th.

    Governor of West Pakistan Malik Amir Muhammad Khan and ministers of various departments of the West Pakistan provincial government, as well as thousands of local people, went to the airport to bid farewell to Chairman Liu Shaoqi. The dense crowds lining the streets shouted slogans and said "Goodbye" to the Chinese guests.

    Before leaving Lahore, Chairman Liu Shaoqi planted a mango tree in the garden of the West Pakistan Governor's residence where they stayed, and Vice Premier Chen Yi also planted a ginkgo tree there. They also visited an agricultural product exhibition, which showcased Pakistan's achievements in promoting new varieties and improved seeds in recent years.

    在卡拉奇机场上欢迎刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理和夫人、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他中国客人的有，巴基斯坦工业和自然资源部长阿塔弗·侯赛因、计划委员会副主席赛义德·哈桑、巴基斯坦海军总司令阿·勒·汗海军中将、当地政府高级官员和各界知名人士。前往机场欢迎的还有各国驻巴基斯坦的外交使节。
    数以千计的欢迎群众聚集在机场的大阳台上和广场上。当刘少奇主席向他们挥手的时候，他们纷纷向中国客人撒玫瑰花瓣。他们发出的“欢迎刘少奇主席！”“欢迎陈毅副总理！”“巴中友谊万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    在卡拉奇的街道上，竖立着刘少奇主席的巨幅画象和中巴两国国旗。悬挂在街道上的横幅，上面用大字的中文和乌尔都文写着：
  “欢迎伟大国家的伟大人民的领导人”、“人民中国万岁”、“巴中友谊万岁”和“亚非团结万岁”。
    当车队经过的时候，胸前挂有刘少奇主席肖象的徽章的姑娘们向中国客人挥手致意。穿着制服的童子军吹起了号角。一些欢迎者高举着的标语牌上写着：“巴基斯坦人民决不会忘记中国的支持”，“患难朋友才是真朋友”，“巴基斯坦学生反对美国侵略”，“支持越南自由战士的斗争”。
