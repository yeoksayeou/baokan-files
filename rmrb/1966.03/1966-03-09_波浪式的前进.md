    The anti-American struggle of the people of all countries today is like the waves of the sea, with ups and downs, highs and lows, but the general trend is that the waves behind push the waves ahead, and each wave is higher than the previous one, constantly moving forward.

    From the perspective of a single country, it is an advance in waves. The Dominican Republic is a good example. In 1963, U.S. imperialism overthrew the constitutional government of the Dominican Republic. The anti-American tide once subsided. In April 1965, the Dominican people launched an armed uprising and overthrew the traitorous dictatorial government supported by the United States. U.S. imperialism sent tens of thousands of troops to intervene. The anti-American tide surged sharply. Later, while stationing troops in the Dominican Republic, U.S. imperialism used the "Reconciliation Act" to disintegrate the constitutional government. The anti-American struggle once became silent. However, since the end of last year, the anti-American struggle in the Dominican Republic has risen again and again.

    From the perspective of a region, it is also an advance in waves. We can clearly see this phenomenon from the development of the entire Latin American situation in the past two or three years. In this vast region, the anti-American struggle has never stopped for a single day, and it is constantly rising. In this continuous rise, there are waves of ups and downs. For example, in 1963, U.S. imperialism launched military coups in a series of Latin American countries to counterattack the national democratic movement of the Latin American people. In this year, Latin American countries still launched anti-American struggles of different scales, but on the whole, it did not appear as a peak of anti-American struggle. However, in January 1964, the Panamanian people broke out in an anti-American patriotic struggle, like a spring thunder, shaking Latin America. Immediately afterwards, the people of many other countries also launched fierce anti-American struggles, including anti-American and anti-dictatorial armed struggles. In this way, an anti-American upsurge was created throughout Latin America. After this, U.S. imperialism successively launched military coups in several countries, causing temporary setbacks to the anti-American struggles in these countries. However, in April 1965, the eruption of the Dominican political volcano and U.S. imperialism's armed intervention in the Dominican Republic once again brought about another upsurge in the anti-American struggle of the entire Latin American people.

    From a global perspective, the situation is more complicated, but it is also an advance in waves. The world's anti-American struggle also has ups and downs, and in this ups and downs, new upsurges are constantly emerging, forming a magnificent picture.

    The ups and downs and constant progress of the anti-American struggles of the people of all countries are not accidental phenomena.

    The contradiction between U.S. imperialism and the people of all countries is irreconcilable. Its invasion, interference, control, and bullying of other countries everywhere will inevitably arouse the resistance of the people of all countries. Its role as a world policeman to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries precisely plays a role in fueling the anti-American tide of the world's people. First of all, U.S. imperialism's intervention and suppression of the people's struggle in one place or another is to mobilize the people of all countries to rise up against U.S. imperialism, thereby creating one anti-American wave after another around the world. At the same time, U.S. imperialism's intervention and suppression of the people's struggle in one place can only create new anti-American storms in that place. Even if the people's struggle there is temporarily quelled, it is only creating a powder keg. The anti-American struggle there will sooner or later break out again. In this way, the anti-American struggle of the people of the world will continue to rise wave after wave.

    However, like the development of all things in the world, the anti-American struggle does not advance in a straight line. The awareness of the people of all countries is gradually increasing. Their strength is gradually increasing. Their struggle experience is gradually accumulated. To completely defeat U.S. imperialism, it is necessary to go through tortuous and repeated struggles. There are low tides, there are high tides, then there are low tides again, and then there are high tides again, going through many low tides and high tides until the final victory. This is a universal law.

    At present, the advantage is no longer on the side of imperialism and reactionaries headed by the United States, but on the side of the world's people. The counterattacks of imperialism and reactionaries can only temporarily gain the upper hand in some places. The people's struggle in these places, which looks like a low tide, is actually brewing a new upsurge. "Listening to thunder in silence," some seemingly silent areas often suddenly erupt in volcanoes, setting off fierce anti-American struggles. And in the world, a new and greater anti-American storm is rising. Through wave-like development, the people of all countries will further take action and grow stronger. U.S. imperialism and all reactionary and decadent forces will inevitably be washed away and submerged step by step in the rolling waves of the people's struggle around the world.

### 波浪式的前进

    波浪式的前进
    何江
    当前各国人民的反美斗争，好象大海里的波涛，有起有伏，有高有低，而总的趋势是后浪推前浪，一浪高一浪，不断地向前发展。
    从一个国家来看，是波浪式的前进。多米尼加就是一个很好的例子。一九六三年，美帝国主义颠覆了多米尼加的宪法政府。反美浪潮曾经一度低落。一九六五年四月，多米尼加人民举行武装起义，推翻了美国扶植的卖国独裁政府。美帝国主义出动几万军队进行干涉。反美浪潮急剧高涨。后来，美帝国主义在陈兵多米尼加的同时，利用“和解法”瓦解了宪法政府。反美斗争曾一度沉寂。但是，从去年年底以来，多米尼加的反美斗争又接连兴起。
    从一个地区来看，也是波浪式的前进。我们从最近两三年来整个拉丁美洲的局势发展中，就可以很清楚地看到这种现象。在这个广大地区，反美斗争一天也没有停息过，它是不断高涨的。而在这不断高涨的过程中，则有着波浪起伏。例如，一九六三年，美帝国主义曾经在拉丁美洲一系列国家制造军事政变，对拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动进行反扑。在这一年中，拉丁美洲各国仍然展开了不同规模的反美斗争，但整个说来，它没有出现反美斗争的高峰。但是，到了一九六四年一月，巴拿马人民爆发了反美爱国斗争，有如一声春雷，震动了拉丁美洲。紧接着，其他许多国家的人民也都展开了激烈的反美斗争，包括反美反独裁的武装斗争。这样，就在整个拉丁美洲造成一个反美的高潮。在这以后，美帝国主义又在几个国家先后制造军事政变，使这些国家的反美斗争受到暂时的挫折。但是，到了一九六五年四月，多米尼加政治火山的爆发和美帝国主义对多米尼加的武装干涉，又使整个拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争出现了另一个高潮。
    从全世界范围来看，情况比较复杂，但同样是波浪式的前进。全世界的反美斗争也是有起有伏，而在这种起伏中不断地出现新的高潮，构成了一幅汹涌澎湃的图画。
    各国人民的反美斗争的波浪起伏，不断前进，不是偶然的现象。
    美帝国主义同各国人民的矛盾是不可调和的。它到处侵略、干涉、控制和欺负别的国家，必然要激起各国人民的反抗。它充当世界宪兵，去镇压各国人民的革命斗争，这对于世界人民的反美浪潮，又恰恰是起了推波助澜的作用。首先，美帝国主义对这一个或那一个地方的人民斗争进行干涉和镇压，也就是调动各国人民起来反对美帝国主义，从而在全世界造成一个又一个反美浪潮。同时，美帝国主义对某一个地方的人民斗争进行干涉和镇压，又只能是在那个地方制造新的反美风暴。即使暂时把那里的人民斗争平息下去了，也不过是制造了一个火药桶。那里的反美斗争迟早还要重新爆发的。这样，就使全世界人民的反美斗争一浪接一浪地不断高涨。
    但是，同世界上一切事物的发展一样，反美斗争并不是直线前进的。各国人民的觉悟是逐步提高的。他们的力量是逐步增强的。他们的斗争经验是逐步积累起来的。要彻底战胜美帝国主义，必须经过曲折反复的斗争。有低潮，有高潮，再有低潮，再有高潮，经过多少次低潮和高潮，直到最后胜利。这是一条普遍的规律。
    目前，优势早已不在以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派方面，而在世界人民方面。帝国主义和反动派进行反扑，只能在某些地方暂时占了上风。这些地方的人民斗争，看起来是低潮，实际上是在酝酿新的高潮。“于无声处听惊雷”，某些表面上看来是沉寂的地区，常常突然火山迸发，掀起猛烈的反美斗争。而在全世界，一个新的更大的反美风暴正在兴起。经过波浪式的发展，各国人民力量必将进一步行动起来，壮大起来。美帝国主义和一切反动腐朽的势力，必将在全世界人民斗争的滚滚波涛面前，一步一步地被冲垮，被淹没。
