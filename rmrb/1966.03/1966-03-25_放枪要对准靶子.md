    "Aim the Gun at the Target..."
    Liu Xingli, Li Borong
    One day, the political instructor said to Wu Jingrun, the instructor of the Seventh Company: "Your company is over-pouring concrete too much, you have to get a good grip on it." Wu Jingrun thought to himself, that's right! If this keeps up, what will become of it?
    Back at the company headquarters, he opened up Chairman Mao's works and found teachings about diligence and frugality. He copied here and drew there, preparing for a full two hours. After dinner, Wu Jingrun took his notebook and went to give a lesson to all the soldiers in the company.
    First, he read aloud to everyone Chairman Mao's quotations on the policy of practicing strict economy, opposing waste, and building the country through diligence and thrift; then he explained the principle that if one more cubic meter of concrete is used, the country will have to spend more than thirty yuan, instructing the soldiers to keep Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind and reduce the over-pouring indicators. He spoke for a full hour. Afraid that the soldiers would not discuss it seriously when they returned, he specifically came up with two discussion questions. After thinking about it, he felt that it was not enough, so he calculated for everyone a detailed account of the waste since the pouring of concrete began. Only then did he let the soldiers return to their discussions with peace of mind.
    A few days later, the small statistician said to the instructor with a statistics table: "What should we do? The over-pouring indicators are still climbing!" Wu Jingrun put down the statistics table, grabbed his safety helmet, and followed the soldiers of the Third Platoon to the construction site.
    Wu Jingrun first pushed a small cart with the soldiers transporting materials. He saw everyone loading more and running faster, one competing with the other, but the cart left droppings like a sheep, with concrete falling all over the ground. After working for a while, he went to the place where materials were loaded, shoveling upwards with the soldiers, while watching the concrete scattering down as the shovels flew up and down, thinking secretly about a problem. In order to get the problem right, he went to the top and tried it with the soldiers pouring concrete, and found that although there were regulations to mix in stones, the soldiers, in order to break through the indicators, seized time, and were afraid of trouble, and did not use stones.
    From pushing carts, passing slurry, and pouring concrete together, Instructor Wu Jingrun clarified the problem: the soldiers had erased three of the four big characters of "more, faster, better, and more economical," leaving only the word "faster."
    Why only grasp the word "faster"? The instructor pondered. Recalling the soldiers shouting on the construction site: "Surpass a certain company to strive for first place." What they were thinking about was the red arrow on the blackboard. After thinking it over, he felt that behind the word "faster" there was something not very good. This was the company's reputation, the class's four-good, and individual honor. More cement was poured, stones were saved, this was the phenomenon, the essence was still how to correctly treat honor. If the attitude towards honor is not right, the work is done faster, but it also causes waste to the country. This is the ideological root of the new soldiers' "over-pouring."
    Wu Jingrun began his second lesson preparation. This time, he combined the soldiers' active thoughts about honor with the study of Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly treating honor, and also read a passage from Comrade Wang Jie's diary on his attitude in the face of honor. Chairman Mao's teachings, Wang Jie's example, and the soldiers' active thoughts were combined. The lesson was finished in only half an hour. The soldiers discussed one after another: "This time the instructor has dug out our old roots." From then on, the "over-pouring" indicators continued to decline. Those transporting and loading materials picked up every drop of slurry that fell. Soon, "over-pouring" was eliminated, and work efficiency was even higher.
    From the two lectures, Wu Jingrun deeply realized: to aim the gun at the target, to grasp living thoughts when giving lectures. Otherwise, from the superficial phenomenon, the lessons are also given, and the time is also spent, but the problem is not solved. Therefore, whether or not politics is truly emphasized is not something that can be accounted for just because enough time has been spent, but depends on the actual effect.

    “放枪要对准靶子……”
    刘兴利  李伯荣
    有一天，教导员对七连指导员吴景润说：“你们连混凝土超灌太多了，得好好抓一抓。”吴景润心想，可也是啊！老这么下去，那还得了。
    回到连部，他翻开毛主席著作，找到了有关勤俭节约的教导，这里抄抄，那里画画，足足准备了两个小时。吃过晚饭，吴景润把本子一夹，去给全连战士上课了。
    首先他把毛主席关于厉行节约、反对浪费、勤俭建国的方针的语录念给大家听；接着又讲了多用一立方米混凝土，国家就要多开支三十多元钱的道理，嘱咐战士们要牢记毛主席的教导，把超灌的指标降下来。足足讲了一个多小时。怕战士们回去讨论不认真，还专门出了两道讨论题。想了想，他觉得还不够劲，又给大家算了从灌注混凝土以来浪费的细账。这时，他才放心地让战士们回去讨论。
    没过几天，小统计员拿着统计表对指导员说：“怎么办哪？超灌的指标还是一个劲地往上爬呀！”吴景润放下统计表，抓起了安全帽，跟着三排战士来到了工地。
    吴景润先是跟运料的战士们一块推小车，只见大家多装快跑，一个赛一个，可是小车走过就象羊拉粪一样，混凝土掉了一地。干了一阵子，他又到上料的地方，一边和战士们一锹锹往上递，一边看着随着铁锹上下飞舞，滴滴哒哒撒下的混凝土，暗暗地想着一个问题。为了把问题弄准，他又到上面与灌混凝土的战士们一起试了试，从中又发现，明明早有规定要掺石头，可是战士们为了突破指标，抢时间，怕麻烦，没有用石头。
    从一起推车、递浆、灌注的劳动中，指导员吴景润把问题弄清楚了，原来战士们把多、快、好、省四个大字，抹去了三个，只留了一个“快”字。
    为什么只抓了一个“快”字呢？指导员心里琢磨开了。回想起战士们在工地上喊的：“超过某连争第一”。心里想的是小黑板上的红箭头。思前想后，他觉得，在“快”字背后有一种不大好的东西。这就是连里的名声，班里的四好，个人的荣誉。多灌了水泥，剩下了石头，这是现象，实质还是如何正确对待荣誉。对待荣誉的态度不对头，活干的是快了，但是也给国家造成了浪费。这正是新战士“超灌”的思想根子。
    吴景润开始第二次备课了。这回，他带着战士对待荣誉的活思想，学习了毛主席关于正确对待荣誉的教导，又看了王杰同志在荣誉面前的态度的一段日记。毛主席的教导，王杰的榜样，战士的活思想三者结合起来了。只用了半个小时，课讲完了。战士们纷纷议论：“这下子指导员把咱们的老根子挖出来了。”打这以后，“超灌”的指标连续下降。运料、上料的，看到有一滴灰浆掉了都要收起来。不久，“超灌”消除了，工效更高了。
    前后两次讲课，吴景润深深体会到：放枪要对准靶子，讲课要抓住活思想。不然，从表面现象看，课也讲了，时间也用了，可并没有解决问题。所以是不是真正突出了政治，不是时间够了，就可以交账的，而要看实际效果。
