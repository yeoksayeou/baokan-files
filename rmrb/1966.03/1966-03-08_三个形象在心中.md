    I came to the Guang'anmenwai Commune in the morning dew to find Comrade Wang Huiquan, but the female comrade who received me told me that she had gone "to make repairs at someone's home." I was very surprised. Isn't she a warehouse keeper? How did she learn to make repairs? The female comrade smiled and said, "Comrade, you don't understand Wang Huiquan. She single-mindedly thinks about how to serve the people more."
    Indeed, Comrade Wang Huiquan is such a person. She is fifty-four years old this year, and her first half of her life was a difficult road. The Party brought her light and warmth, and she single-mindedly listened to Chairman Mao's words and followed the Party. In 1950, she joined the ranks of the Party. For ten years, she had been working as the director of the street residents' committee. In 1960, she was transferred to the Guang'anmenwai Commune Comprehensive Repair Factory as a warehouse keeper. The room full of parts and materials made her dizzy and her head swim. She also thought, I don't know half a peck of characters, can I manage the warehouse? But then she thought: I am a Communist Party member, I should do whatever the Party asks me to do, and I must overcome difficulties and not retreat. At first, she used drawing squares, triangles, and lines to replace bookkeeping, but how could she keep doing this? For the needs of the revolution, she didn't care about her age and poor memory, and she was determined to start from scratch.
    She asked someone to copy the names of the materials onto small pieces of paper and began to study. But these words seemed to be playing hide-and-seek with her, forgetting what she learned today tomorrow, and it felt like she was lifting a thousand pounds when she picked up the pen. It was difficult, really difficult. The Party told her that when she encountered difficulties, she should consult Chairman Mao's works. She picked up the book "Serve the People" and asked someone to read it to her. As she listened, she became engrossed and fascinated. She felt that Chairman Mao's words spoke to her heart, and with love for Chairman Mao and the ideal of serving the people, she picked up these pieces of paper again.
    She studied before meetings, before meals, while walking, and even on the bus. Workers, soldiers, and students all became her teachers. Back home, the light in front of the window stayed on until late at night, as she read and thought about each word. Sometimes, when she encountered a stumbling block, she would gently wake up her sleeping daughter, who would pout with sleepy eyes. She would then coax her in a soft voice, "You are a good daughter. If you teach Mom, and Mom manages the warehouse well, it will also be your achievement. You are also serving the people." Her daughter understood her mother's heart and became her mother's little teacher from then on. Under the lamp, the mother and daughter held hands, head to head, with the same voice ringing in their hearts: In order to better serve the people, we must learn well and teach well. In this way, Wang Huiquan finally learned bookkeeping and simple vocabulary.
    How to better serve the people? This question churned in Wang Huiquan's heart day and night. She always felt that she was not doing enough, so she took the initiative to deliver materials to people's homes and volunteered to work as a purchasing agent. Every time she bought materials, she needed to spend money to hire a car to transport them. She thought: The Party calls on us to build the country diligently and thriftily, and to run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. If we can save, we should save as much as possible. So she pulled the factory's flatbed cart and transported them back herself. In her work, she made many friends who pulled carts and learned how to load the cart and steer it. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, or severe cold and scorching heat, she often pulled the cart to transport materials to the factory. Drops of sweat sprinkled all over the road. She felt that only in this way would she live a more meaningful life and feel more at ease in her heart.
    She never knew fatigue, let alone tiredness. She often said: "I want to learn from three people, namely Dr. Bethune, Zhang Side, and Old Man Yu Gong." These three images are guiding her to move forward continuously.
    In 1962, the Comprehensive Repair Factory was split into branches, mainly engaged in black and white iron and cage repair business. Last year, the Party committee called on people to carry forward the "back basket" spirit, go out of the factory gate, go from street to street, and bring repair services to people's doorsteps. But some women felt that pushing a cart on the street, shouting and hawking, they could not open their mouths when they saw strangers, and they were even more ashamed when they saw acquaintances. Wang Huiquan thought: I am a Communist Party member, and I should take the lead in doing things that are beneficial to the masses. She took the lead in pushing out the cart, and her footprints were left in the streets and alleys, and her voice was heard from door to door.
    Some people say: Wang Huiquan is not only repairing for the masses, but also a volunteer propagandist! This is true. Once, she went from door to door and saw that the bottom of someone's washbasin was broken. As soon as she took it to repair it, the old aunt stopped her and said, "This broken thing is useless and not worth repairing." When Wang Huiquan heard this, she said, "Auntie, this basin can still be used for a long time if you change the bottom! Our country has to use steel to build buildings and make machines, so we should let steel be used in the most useful places. Besides, it costs five or six cents to repair this basin, and it can still be used the same way, and it can also save more than a dollar." These words moved the aunt's heart and made her change the bottom of the basin, and she also used sand to wipe the washbasin clean and bright.
    She wholeheartedly served the masses, and the masses also regarded her as a confidant. Whenever the sound of a cart came from the street corner, it was like a gust of spring breeze blowing open the doors of every household. The Young Pioneers hopped and brought out tea, and the old ladies and aunts automatically lined up to have their items repaired, picked up benches and chatted with her, and poured out their hearts.
    In the evening, I went to her house. As soon as I sat down, the door was pushed open one after another. First, the director of the residents' committee came to invite her to participate in the residents' committee and let her guide the work. Then, a reckless little boy broke into the house and said that his mother wanted to find her and asked her to go there once in the evening. I smiled and asked her, "You take care of so many things!" She said happily, "I am a Communist Party member, and I can't ignore the affairs of the masses." A photo of the mother and daughter on the wall caught my attention, and the topic immediately turned to her daughter. I asked, "Old Wang, you only have one daughter, and you sent her to the Great Northern Wilderness. Are you really willing to do that?" She restrained her smile and said seriously, "We must listen to the Party's words. As long as it is beneficial to the country, we will do it. Precisely because I only have one daughter, I want her to guard the border and do more for the country."

    三个形象在心中
    肖波
    我踏着晨露来到广安门外公社，要找王惠泉同志，接待我的女同志却告诉我，她“上门修理”去了。我很惊异，她不是仓库管理员吗，怎么又学会修理了呢？那女同志笑着说：同志，你还不了解王惠泉，她啊，就一个心眼地想怎么多为人民服务。
    的确，王惠泉同志就是这样的人，她今年五十四岁了，她的前半辈子走过了一条艰难的道路。党给她带来了光明和温暖，她一个心眼听毛主席的话，跟党走。一九五○年她参加了党的队伍。十年来，她一直担任着街道居民委员会主任的工作。一九六○年被调到广安门外公社综合修理工厂当仓库保管员。满屋的零件、材料，看得她眼花缭乱，头昏脑胀。她也想过，我斗大的字不识半升，能管得了库吗？可她又想：我是个共产党员，党叫干啥就干啥，有困难要克服，不能后退。开始她用画方块，三角，画线来代替记账，可是，怎么能老这样呢，为了革命的需要，她顾不得自己上了岁数，记忆力差，决心从头学起。
    她请人把材料名称都抄在一张张的小纸片上，开始了学习。可是这些词好象故意和她捉迷藏，今天学的明天就忘，提起笔来更有千斤重，难啊，真难啊。党告诉她遇到了困难，应该去向毛主席著作请教。她拿起了《为人民服务》这本书，请人念给她听，听着、听着，她听得出了神，入了迷。她觉得毛主席的话句句讲到了她心坎上，怀着对毛主席的热爱，怀着为人民服务的理想，她重新捧起了这些纸片。
    开会前学，吃饭前学，走路学，公共汽车上也学。工人、战士、学生都当过她的老师。回到家，窗前的灯火就一直亮到深夜，她一个字一个字地念着，想着。有时遇到了拦路虎，她便轻轻推醒酣睡着的闺女，闺女睡眼矇眬地噘起嘴。她便细声慢语地哄闺女：“你是个好闺女，你把妈妈教会了，妈把仓库管好了，也是你的成绩。你这也算是为人民服务。”闺女懂得了妈妈的心，从此当起妈妈的小老师来。灯下，母女俩手把着手，头挨着头，心里响着同一个声音：为了更好地为人民服务，必须学好，教好。就这样，王惠泉终于学会记账和简单的词汇。
    如何更好地为人民服务呢？这个问题在王惠泉的心中日夜翻腾着。她总觉得自己做得太少，于是，她主动送料上门，自告奋勇兼任采购员。每次买了料，需要花钱雇车运，她想：党号召我们勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业，能节约就应该尽量节约，她就拉着厂里的排子车自己运回来，在工作中，她交了许多拉车的朋友，学会了装车，掌把。不分春夏秋冬，不论严寒酷暑，她常拉着车子往厂里运料。一颗颗的汗珠，洒遍了大路。她觉得，只有这样，才越活越有意思，越活心里越坦实。
    她从不知疲倦，更不知劳累。她常常说：“我要向三个人学习，就是白大夫，张思德，老愚公”。这三个形象正引导她不断前进。
    一九六二年，综合修理厂分厂了，他们主要经营黑白铁、笼屉修理业务。去年，党委号召大学“背篓”精神，走出厂门，走街串巷，把修理服务送上门。但有的妇女，觉得推车上街，吆喝买卖，见了生人，张不开嘴，见了熟人，更是满面羞愧。王惠泉想：我是个共产党员，对群众有利的事，应该带头干。她带头推出了小车，大街小巷，都留下了她的脚印，挨门挨户，传出了她的声音。
    有人说：王惠泉不但是给群众修修补补，还是个义务宣传员呢！这话不假。有一次，她串门入户，看到人家的脸盆底坏了，刚拿去想修，那家的大娘却拦住了她，说：“这破东西没啥用了，值不得修理了。”王惠泉一听这话，就说：“大娘，这盆换个底还可以使好久呢！咱们国家盖楼造机器，都得用钢铁，应该让铁用在最有用的地方，再说这盆花五六毛钱修好了一样用，还能节省一块多钱。”一番话，说动了大娘的心，让她换了盆底，她还用沙土把脸盆擦得净亮。
    她一心一意为群众，群众也把她当作知心人。每当街口传来小车吱吱声，就象一阵春风刮开了各家的大门，红领巾们蹦蹦跳跳地端出了茶水，大娘大婶们把要修的物件都自动地排起了队，拿起板凳来和她谈心，把心里的话都倒了出来。
    晚上，我到她家里。刚坐不一会，门就接二连三地被推开，先是居民委员会主任来约她参加居委会，让她指导指导工作，接着，一个愣头愣脑的小男孩闯进了屋，说他妈妈要找她，让她晚上去一次。我笑着问她：“你管的事儿真多啊！”她乐呵呵地说：“我是个共产党员，群众的事不能不管。”墙上一张母女合影引起了我的注意，话题一下转到她闺女身上，我问：“老王，你只有一个闺女，还把她送到北大荒。你真舍得。”她收敛了笑容，正正经经地说：“党的话咱一定要听，只要对国家有利，咱就干。正因为我只有一个闺女，更要让她去把边疆口子，多为国家出力。”
