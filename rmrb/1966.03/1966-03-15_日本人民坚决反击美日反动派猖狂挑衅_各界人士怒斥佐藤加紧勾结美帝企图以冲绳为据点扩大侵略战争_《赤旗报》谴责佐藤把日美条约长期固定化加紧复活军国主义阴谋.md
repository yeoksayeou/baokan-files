    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 14th: People from all walks of life in mainland Japan and Okinawa have issued statements angrily denouncing Japanese Prime Minister Sato for repeatedly clamoring in the Diet to send Japanese troops to "defend" Okinawa together with the United States, in order to serve as an accomplice in U.S. aggression.
      Masao Iwama, Deputy Head of the Japanese Communist Party Congressional Group, published an article in the March 14th issue of "Akahata" stating: "Prime Minister Sato's speech increasingly exposes the Sato government's intention to fully cooperate with U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression."
    He emphasized that U.S. imperialism, based on the "San Francisco Treaty" and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," has long carried out military rule over Okinawa and has turned all of Japan into a U.S. military base.
    Iwama condemned the Sato government for not only attempting to cover up this reality but also emphasizing the need to fulfill the "obligations" of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to pave the way for sending the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" to participate in the U.S. war of aggression. He stressed that the Japanese people absolutely cannot allow this.
    He then pointed out: "To satisfy the urgent demands of returning the Okinawan people to the embrace of their motherland and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Okinawa, it is necessary to achieve Japan's true independence and remove the U.S. aggressive bases that threaten peace in Asia."
    Kamejiro Senaga, Chairman of the Okinawa People's Party, pointed out that "Just as [the United States] is expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam with Okinawa as an advanced base, Prime Minister Sato's speech clearly exposes that the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' which in fact includes Okinawa in the 'defense zone,' is a war treaty."
    Senaga said that Sato's speech shows his traitorous and reactionary essence.
    Lawyer Eiichiro Fukazawa said, "Sato's speech is completely as reactionary as that of a Japanese fascist wartime cabinet minister." Fukazawa said, "We are fighting to remove the U.S. military's nuclear base from Okinawa, and Sato's speech is a challenge to our struggle."
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 14th: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," published an article on the 14th pointing out that the Sato government's proposal in the Diet to perpetuate the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a submission to the pressure of U.S. imperialism, which is attempting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and demonstrates the strong demand of Japanese monopoly capital to revive militarism.
    The article exposes Eisaku Sato's recent justifications for perpetuating the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Sato stubbornly insisted that "because of this treaty, Japan's 'security' is reliably guaranteed," and he also said, "Now, Japan must not only enjoy benefits but must also sincerely fulfill the 'obligations' stipulated by the treaty." These arguments are a tactic to force the Japanese people to agree to and fulfill the "obligations" stipulated by the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," such as providing bases to the United States, agreeing to the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines and nuclear-powered fleets into Japanese ports, assisting the United States in expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, and sending the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" overseas under the name of the "United Nations Forces" to participate in the U.S. war of aggression.
    The article refutes Sato and others' cliché of "defending Japan's security against communist aggression," pointing out that this is shameless and despicable propaganda. The article points out that even children now know that U.S. imperialism is the aggressor. It is U.S. imperialism that is crossing oceans to invade Vietnam, Korea, and other countries in Asia.
    The article, in refuting U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's spread of the so-called Chinese "threat" and the use of the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" to "protect" Japan, said that U.S. imperialism, based on the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," has turned Japan into its base and is expanding the war of aggression in Asia. This is not only not "guaranteeing" Japan's security but is precisely the root of the danger of dragging Japan into war.
    The article called on the Japanese people to use the successful holding of the March 20th unified action to fight back against the provocations of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    日本人民坚决反击美日反动派猖狂挑衅
    各界人士怒斥佐藤加紧勾结美帝企图以冲绳为据点扩大侵略战争
    《赤旗报》谴责佐藤把日美条约长期固定化加紧复活军国主义阴谋
    据新华社十四日讯　东京消息：日本本土和冲绳各界人士发表谈话，愤怒谴责日本首相佐藤在国会里一再叫嚷要派日本军队同美国一起“保卫”冲绳，以便充当美国侵略帮凶。
      日本共产党国会议员团副团长岩间正男在十四日的《赤旗报》上发表讲话说：“佐藤首相的讲话，越来越露骨地暴露了佐藤政府同美帝国主义在扩大侵略战争方面实行全面合作的意图。”
    他强调说，美帝国主义根据“旧金山和约”和日美“安全条约”，长期对冲绳进行军事统治，并且使整个日本变成美国的军事基地。
    岩间谴责佐藤政府不仅企图掩盖这一现实情况，而且强调什么需要履行日美“安全条约”的“义务”，以便给派日本“自卫队”参加美国的侵略战争开辟道路。他强调指出，日本人民对此是绝对不能容许的。
    他接着指出：“要满足使冲绳人民返回祖国怀抱以及美国军队撤出冲绳等迫切要求，就必须实现日本的真正独立，同时撤除威胁亚洲和平的美国的侵略基地。”
    冲绳人民党主席濑长龟次郎指出，“正当（美国）以冲绳为前进据点扩大侵越战争的时候，佐藤首相的讲话，清楚地暴露了事实上把冲绳划进‘防卫区域’的日美‘安全条约’，是一个战争条约。”
    濑长说，佐藤的讲话，表明了他的卖国的反动本质。
    律师深泽荣一郎说，“佐藤的讲话，完全象日本法西斯战时内阁大臣的讲话一样反动。”深泽说，“我们正在为使美军从冲绳撤除核基地而进行斗争，佐藤的讲话是对我们的斗争进行挑战”。
  据新华社东京十四日电　日本共产党中央机关报《赤旗报》十四日发表文章指出，佐藤政府在国会上提出要把日美“安全条约”长期固定化，是屈服于企图扩大侵越战争的美帝国主义的压力和表明日本垄断资本复活军国主义的强烈要求。
    文章揭露佐藤荣作最近为使日美“安全条约”长期固定下来而进行的辩解。佐藤硬说，“因为有这个条约，日本的‘安全’才得到可靠的保证”，他还说，“现在，日本不仅只是享受恩惠，而且必须以诚意来履行”条约所规定的“义务”。这些论调，是一种手法，那就是企图强使日本人民同意和履行向美国提供基地、同意美国核潜艇和核动力舰队进入日本港口；协助美国扩大侵越战争以及日本“自卫队”以“联合国军”名义向海外派兵参加美国的侵略战争等日美“安全条约”所规定的“义务”。
    文章在驳斥佐藤等人的“为反对共产主义的侵略而保卫日本的安全”的滥调时指出，这是厚颜无耻的卑劣宣传。文章指出，现在连小孩子都知道美帝国主义才是侵略者。因为越过重洋正在侵略越南、朝鲜和亚洲其他国家的，正是美帝国主义。
    文章在驳斥美国国防部长麦克纳马拉散布的所谓中国的“威胁”和用美国的“核保护伞”“保卫”日本时说，美帝国主义根据日美“安全条约”，把日本变成它的基地，在亚洲扩大侵略战争，不仅不是“保障”日本的安全，而正是把日本卷进战争的危险的根源。
    文章号召日本人民用成功地举行三月二十日统一行动来反击美日反动派的挑衅行为。
