    Củ Chi County’s “American-Annihilating Heroes” Joint Celebration and Vietnamese *People's Army Daily* Point Out the Great Significance of Củ Chi and Bồng Sơn Victories
    Vice-Chairman Phùng Văn Cung Emphasizes that the South Vietnamese People Can Persist in the Anti-American National Salvation Struggle for a Long Time
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 28th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the glorious victory of the military and civilians of Củ Chi County demonstrates that the decisive factor in battle victories is the spirit and righteous power of the revolutionary people. The American bandits are merely "paper tigers," and the Vietnamese people will surely defeat them.
    This was put forth in a summary report on the Củ Chi victory recently delivered at the first “American-Annihilating Heroes” Joint Celebration held in Củ Chi County, Gia Định Province, South Vietnam.
    From January 8th to February 5th of this year, the military and civilians in the northern and southern regions of Củ Chi County defeated a large-scale "mopping-up" operation by tens of thousands of American bandits, annihilating more than 2,600 American aggressors and their puppet troops. In this battle to severely punish the American aggressors, a large number of "Heroic American-Annihilating Units" and "American-Annihilating Heroes" emerged.
    Ninety-seven “American-Annihilating Heroes” and representatives of "Heroic American-Annihilating Units" participated in the joint celebration. Their heroic deeds in killing the enemy were warmly praised at the meeting. Among them: The militia of An Phú commune, which conducted more than 40 battles in seven days, annihilated nearly 300 American bandits, shot down seven enemy planes, and damaged twelve; the guerrilla fighters from Trung Lập Hạ commune fought for ten hours in a small area, repelling over ten enemy offensives supported by aircraft, artillery, and armored vehicles, and killing 118 American bandits; female guerrilla leader Võ Thị Mợ actively coordinated with brother units to jointly annihilate 26 American aggressors; combat team leader Sơn of a certain unit of the Liberation Armed Forces, together with other comrades-in-arms, launched a night attack on the headquarters of an American brigade, killing 82 American aggressors, destroying one 105mm howitzer, one 81mm mortar, one heavy machine gun, and one M-113 amphibious armored vehicle; the famous "King of Mines," comrade Quế, militia captain of Đức Hiệp commune, together with other militiamen, used mines to kill 57 American aggressors, in addition to destroying three M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and three military vehicles each, and shooting down three helicopters.
    These "American-Annihilating Heroes" vividly reported their combat deeds to the meeting, and the entire venue repeatedly erupted in warm applause and victorious cheers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 28th – The Vietnamese *People's Army Daily* published a commentary on the 28th, pointing out that the glorious victory of the military and civilians in the Bồng Sơn area of Bình Định Province, South Vietnam, is a heroic ode to the invincible people's war.
    The commentary said that since the United States dispatched troops to directly invade South Vietnam, the battle of Bồng Sơn was the one in which it mobilized the most troops and the "mopping-up" operation lasted the longest, and it was also the one in which it suffered the most disastrous defeat.
    The commentary said that the American bandits threw more than 20,000 troops into one battlefield at the same time, supported by hundreds of aircraft and artillery, and smugly thought that this time they would "eliminate the Viet Cong's regular army." However, the invincible power of people's war shattered all the foolish and subjective plans of the American aggressors. Wherever the US military and puppet troops went, they were beaten to a pulp by the Liberation Armed Forces, in a sorry plight. The Liberation Armed Forces fighters used elusive and diversionary tactics, sometimes intercepting the enemy in front and sometimes pursuing the enemy from behind. They flexibly used various combat forms such as ambushes, attacks, and artillery strikes, putting themselves in a proactive position and putting the enemy in an embarrassing situation of passively coping, being on tenterhooks day and night, unable to sit or sleep in peace, exhausted, and finally eliminated.
    The commentary said that the Bình Định Provincial Liberation Armed Forces continuously fought against "mopping-up" operations for more than a month, fighting enemies far outnumbering them in a not very wide area, flexibly exerting their strength, defeating the strong with the weak, defeating the many with the few, and giving the American bandits and their running dogs increasingly heavy blows with unparalleled bravery and tenacity. The American aggressors carried out "mopping-up" operations in this coastal plain area near the strategic highway, where they could mobilize their forces flexibly and get strong support from the strongholds along Highway 1 in this area, and the US Seventh Fleet on the sea also often provided support. They thought the terrain was favorable to them, but they still suffered a disastrous defeat.
    The commentary said that the battle of Bồng Sơn powerfully proved the invincible power of people's war. The American aggressors' arrogant fantasy of trying to "overwhelm the Viet Cong main force" has been shattered.
    The commentary pointed out that the glorious victory of the military and civilians of Bình Định Province in the Bồng Sơn area shows that the American bandits' steel, bombs, and poison gas can never subdue the people of South Vietnam, and the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces fighters will surely give the American aggressors and their dog troops more and heavier blows, burying the American aggressor bandits in the flames of people's war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 28th – According to the *Liberation Daily*, the central organ newspaper of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, Phùng Văn Cung, Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, recently told a *Liberation Daily* reporter: The South Vietnamese people "have enough strength to persevere in the anti-American national salvation struggle for ten, twenty, or even longer years."
    Phùng Văn Cung made these remarks after inspecting some liberated areas in the western region of southern South Vietnam.
    Phùng Văn Cung said that in the western region of the south, the strength of the South Vietnamese people in all aspects has grown rapidly, and the anti-American national salvation struggle is developing very deeply and broadly.
    He said that although the American bandits have exhausted all cruel means against the South Vietnamese people, indiscriminately bombing and even spraying chemical poisons, people still remain and rely on a solid network of tunnels to continue production, study, and fight. The village guerrillas bravely ambush the enemy in the anti-"mopping-up" battles, seize weapons, and arm themselves. Now they not only have enough rifles, but also other weapons, not only hitting the enemy on the ground, but also hitting the enemy's planes.
    Phùng Văn Cung said that the people have generally participated in the battle. They are always ready to strike the enemy and defend their homeland.
    He also mentioned that even the people living in enemy-occupied areas are supporting the anti-American national salvation cause with practical actions. (Attached picture)

    古芝和蓬山大捷证明人民战争威力无敌  真正强大的是南越人民而不是泥足巨人
    南越古芝县“歼美勇士”联欢大会和越南《人民军队报》指出古芝和蓬山大捷意义重大
    冯文恭副主席强调南越人民能够长期坚持抗美救国斗争
    新华社河内二十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，古芝县军民的辉煌胜利表明：战斗胜利的决定因素是革命人民的精神和正义的力量。美国强盗只不过是“泥足巨人”，越南人民一定会战胜他们。
    这是最近在越南南方嘉定省古芝县举行的第一次“歼美勇士”联欢大会上发表的关于古芝大捷的总结报告中提出的。
    从今年一月八日到二月五日，古芝县南、北部地区军民，击败了美国强盗成万人的大规模“扫荡”，一举歼灭美国侵略军及其仆从军二千六百多名。在这次痛歼美国侵略者的战斗中，涌现出大批“英勇歼美单位”和“歼美勇士”。
    参加这次联欢大会的有九十七名“歼美勇士”和
  “英勇歼美单位”的代表。他们英勇杀敌的事迹受到了大会的热烈表扬。他们当中如：安富乡民兵，在七天中连续进行了四十多次战斗，歼灭美国强盗近三百名，击落敌机七架，击伤十二架；中立下乡的游击队战士们在一块狭小的地方进行了十个小时的战斗，击退在飞机、大炮和装甲车掩护下的敌人上十次进攻，并且打死美国强盗一百一十八名；女游击组长武氏模主动协同兄弟单位作战，共同歼灭了二十六名美国侵略军；解放武装力量某部队的战斗组长山同志和其他战友一起，夜袭美军一个旅的参谋部，打死八十二名美国侵略军，击毁一○五毫米大炮一门、八十一毫米的迫击炮一门、重机枪一挺和M—113两栖装甲车一辆；著名的“地雷大王”、德协乡民兵队长瑰同志，和其他民兵一起，用地雷炸死美国侵略军五十七名，此外，还击毁M—113两栖装甲车和军用车各三辆、击落直升飞机三架。
    这些“歼美勇士”向大会生动地报告了他们的战斗事迹，全场一再爆发出热烈的掌声和胜利的欢呼声。
    新华社河内二十八日电　越南《人民军队报》二十八日发表评论指出，越南南方平定省蓬山地区军民反“扫荡”的辉煌胜利，是无敌的人民战争的一首英雄赞歌。
    评论说，自从美国派遣军队直接侵略越南南方以来，蓬山一战是它出动军队最多、“扫荡”时间最长的一次战斗，也是它遭到最惨重失败的一次战斗。
    评论说，美国强盗在同一时间内向一个战场抛出两万多名军队，并以成百架飞机和大炮作支援，还得意洋洋地认为这一次将“消灭越共的正规军”。但是，无敌的人民战争力量粉碎了美国侵略者的一切愚蠢和主观的打算。美军及仆从军走到哪里，都被解放武装力量打得落花流水，焦头烂额。解放武装力量战士们以神出鬼没、声东击西的战术，时而在前面截击敌人，时而又在后面追击敌人，他们灵活地运用伏击、袭击、炮击等各种战斗形式，使自己处于主动，而使敌人陷于被动应付的尴尬处境，日夜提心吊胆，坐卧不安，疲劳不堪，不断被消耗，最后终于被消灭掉。
    评论说，平定省解放武装力量连续反“扫荡”一个多月，同人数远超过自己的敌人在一个不很宽的地区战斗，灵活地发挥自己的力量，以弱胜强，以少胜多，无比英勇顽强，给予美国强盗及其走狗越来越沉重的打击。美国侵略者在这个靠近战略公路的沿海平原地区进行“扫荡”，它可以机动地调动兵力，又可得到这个地区沿第一号公路的据点给予有力的支持，海面上的美国第七舰队也经常给予支援，它以为地形对它是有利的，但是，仍然遭到了惨重的失败。
    评论说，蓬山之战有力地证明了人民战争的无敌力量。美国侵略者企图“压倒越共主力”的狂妄的幻想已经破灭了。
    评论指出，平定省军民在蓬山地区的辉煌胜利表明，美国强盗的钢铁、炸弹和毒气永远不能使越南南方人民屈服，越南南方解放武装战士们必将给予美国侵略者及其走狗军队以更多、更沉重的打击，使美国侵略强盗葬身在人民战争的烈火中。
    新华社河内二十八日电　据南南方民族解放阵线中央机关报《解放报》报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团副主席冯文恭最近对《解放报》记者说：越南南方人民“有足够的力量把抗美救国斗争坚持到十年、二十年或者更长时间”。
    冯文恭是在视察了越南南方南部西区的一些解放区后发表这篇谈话的。
    冯文恭说，在南部西区，越南南方人民在各方面的力量都迅速成长壮大，抗美救国斗争非常深入和广泛地发展着。
    他说，虽然美国强盗对南越人民用尽了一切残暴手段，狂轰滥炸，甚至撒放化学毒药，但人们仍都留下来依靠着坚固的地道网继续坚持生产、学习和战斗。村里的游击队在反“扫荡”战斗中，英勇伏击敌人时，夺取武器、武装自己。现在他们不仅有足够的步枪，而且还有其他武器，不仅打击地面上的敌人，还打敌人的飞机。
    冯文恭说，人民都普遍地参加了战斗。他们随时都准备打击敌人，保卫自己的家乡。
    他还谈到，即使是生活在敌占区的人民，也在用实际行动支持抗美救国事业。（附图片）
