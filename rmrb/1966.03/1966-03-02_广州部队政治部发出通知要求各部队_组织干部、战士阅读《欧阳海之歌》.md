    Guangzhou Military Region Political Department Issues Notice Requiring All Units
    to Organize Cadres and Soldiers to Read "Ouyang Hai's Song"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st) The Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice requiring all units to vigorously organize cadres and soldiers to read "Ouyang Hai's Song," and to link the organization and guidance of reading "Ouyang Hai's Song" with the implementation of the five principles of giving prominence to politics, and with launching a new upsurge in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works.
    The notice said that the full-length biographical novel "Ouyang Hai's Song" is a good work for publicizing Mao Zedong Thought. It is a good teaching material for giving prominence to politics, strengthening political and ideological work, and grasping living ideas firmly, and is a good teaching material to inspire and educate all commanders and fighters to accelerate revolutionization.
    The notice said that Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on literary and artistic work in the army pointed out: "Proletarian literature and art... It is a powerful ideological weapon, a tool for publicizing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in a vivid and popular way." "Ouyang Hai's Song," this excellent socialist literary work, is precisely a supplementary reading material for studying Chairman Mao's works and a powerful tool for ideological education. For this reason, political organs at all levels must link the organization and guidance of reading this work with the implementation of the five principles of giving prominence to politics, and with launching a new upsurge in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

    广州部队政治部发出通知要求各部队
    组织干部、战士阅读《欧阳海之歌》
    据新华社广州一日电  中国人民解放军广州部队政治部最近发出通知，要求各部队大力组织干部、战士阅读《欧阳海之歌》，并把组织和指导阅读《欧阳海之歌》，与贯彻执行突出政治五项原则联系起来，与掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮联系起来。
    通知说，长篇传记小说《欧阳海之歌》是一部宣传毛泽东思想的好作品。它是一部突出政治，加强政治思想工作，大抓狠抓活思想的好教材，是鼓舞和教育全体指战员加速革命化的好教材。
    通知说，林彪副主席对部队文艺工作的指示指出：“无产阶级文艺……它是强有力的思想武器，是形象地、通俗地宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的工具。”《欧阳海之歌》这部优秀的社会主义文学作品，正是学习毛主席著作的辅助读物，也是思想教育的有力工具，为此，各级政治机关必须把组织和指导阅读这一作品与贯彻执行突出政治五项原则联系起来，与掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮联系起来。
