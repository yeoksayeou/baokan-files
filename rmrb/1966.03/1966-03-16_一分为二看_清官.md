    Looking at "Upright Officials" with One Divides into Two
    Sun Guangxuan, Liu Dunwen
    Summary: "Upright officials" must both maintain the feudal exploitation system and prevent driving peasants to rebellion. They are both executioners and swindlers. To think that "upright officials" have both bad and good sides is not one divides into two, but eclecticism.
        "Upright Officials" Can Be Divided into Two
    In the discussion about "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," many people, under the guise of one divides into two, beautify Hai Rui to defend Comrade Wu Han's mistakes. Comrade Wu Han said in his "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'": "In terms of ideological understanding, subjectively wanting to highlight Hai Rui's good side, the writing became more and more one-sided... only talking about the advantages, and rarely or not talking about the shortcomings, portraying Hai Rui as a very tall, complete, and flawless politician of the feudal era." This means that Hai Rui had both good and bad sides. Comrade Jiang Xingyu also questioned in this way: "What we find difficult is how to apply one divides into two to Hai Rui?" "Is one divides into two applicable to specific historical figures? Is one divides into two a universal truth?" "Some say that affirming Hai Rui served the feudal ruling class and negating that Hai Rui did good things for the people. This is certainly correct, but is it the right way to put it as one divides into two?" (Wenhui Bao, January 7, 1966, Symposium Minutes) It seems that they thought that by asking these questions, they could deal a heavy blow to the other side, making them unable to speak again.
    Yes, since one divides into two is the most universal and general law of things, it is, of course, fully applicable to analyzing "upright officials." The problem is how to apply one divides into two to "upright officials."
    The world's affairs are complex and ever-changing. They are composed of various different contradictions. Therefore, one divides into two must also have its infinitely many forms of expression. That is to say, the one divides into two of each specific thing must be expressed through specific and unique forms. Whether or not one can correctly analyze specific things depends not only on the method but first and foremost on what class standpoint you are taking and what viewpoint you are using to conduct the analysis. Only by firmly standing on the proletarian class standpoint and using the Marxist viewpoint of one divides into two can we dispel the heavy fog created by the feudal ruling classes throughout history and restore "upright officials" to their original features.
      How to Divide "Upright Officials" into Two
    To analyze "upright officials" with one divides into two, one must first start by analyzing the essence and characteristics of "upright officials." The essence of "upright officials," like all other officials, is that they are tools of the feudal ruling class to oppress and exploit the people. But "upright officials" also have their characteristics: they must both be loyal to the emperor and "pacify the people," that is, both maintain the feudal exploitation system and prevent driving the peasants to rebellion. Taking Hai Rui as an example, he always prided himself on "certainly seeking to live up to His Majesty's desire for governance." Therefore, he did not hesitate to "risk death and exhaustively speak a word for Your Majesty," submitting the "Petition for Social Order" to the Jiajing Emperor. It can be said that "loyalty to the emperor" was the starting point of all his words and deeds. And his "pacifying the people" was only considering that "the people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is strong, the state is secure," only for the sake of better loyalty to the emperor and better seeking "eternal security" for the feudal dynasty. Therefore, on the one hand, he actively strengthened feudal rule: vigorously promoting the baojia system, consolidating the basic organizations of the feudal regime, reorganizing the army and repairing the city, and exercising strict control over the people; on the other hand, he opposed some people within the feudal ruling class who "want to make plans for present-day temporary peace and do not think of the endless benefits for ten thousand generations," opposed "draining the pond to catch all the fish," and frankly said, "Draining the pond to catch all the fish, one may get fish, but there will be no fish next year," racking his brains to prevent driving the peasants to rebellion.
    How did Comrade Wu Han view Hai Rui? He believed that Hai Rui "consciously did some good things," and that Hai Rui's actions were both "consistent with the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class and consistent with the current interests of the vast oppressed and exploited people." Comrade Wu Han committed two serious errors here. First, Hai Rui's preventing the peasants from being driven to rebellion actually meant strengthening control over the peasants, allowing the ruling class to exploit them to their heart's content, and making them struggle on the verge of death day and night. Lenin once sharply criticized those bourgeois figures who wantonly beautified the landlords: "You don't understand that you are not turning slaves into revolutionaries, but turning slaves into lackeys." Four hundred years later, Comrade Wu Han still kept saying that Hai Rui and other upright officials "consciously did some good things." Isn't this propagating the philosophy of lackeys? Second, Hai Rui's certain measures may have been able to achieve temporary and local "pacification of the people," but since he was intent on strengthening feudal rule, in the end, even certain temporary "sweeteners" would in fact be turned into nothing, and the peasants would still be driven to rebellion. For example, Hai Rui forced the peasants to be enemies with "miners and poor people" and posted notices threatening, "If you don't die at the hands of the enemy, you will surely die by the law. Dying as an enemy is an act of loyalty, dying by the law is being foolish and stubborn," is one example. What reason did Comrade Wu Han have to praise these so-called "good things" without reservation, and single-mindedly regard these so-called "good things" as the "fruits" that the peasants obtained without any discount? Isn't this deliberately reversing black and white, confusing right and wrong, and promoting illusions about the ruling class?
    Precisely because Hai Rui had to both maintain feudal exploitation and prevent driving the peasants to rebellion, his "achievements" were characterized by a remarkable feature: he was good at adopting counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics towards the people. He often combined both soft and hard approaches, acting as both a swindler and an executioner. When the working people had not yet been driven to rebellion, Hai Rui appeared with a "soft" posture, but once they were "driven to rebellion" and rose up to resist, Hai Rui immediately advocated "crimes that cannot be forgiven," saying, "It is also permissible to decree that the ten evils and serious crimes such as robbery should not be pardoned." Now some people think that "upright officials" only use the "soft" hand, or even only mean "concessions" to the peasants. This is being deceived by the ruling class. Lenin said: "All oppressive classes, in order to maintain their rule, need two kinds of social functions: one is the function of the executioner, and the other is the function of the priest." This is true for an oppressive class, and for "upright officials," who are tools of the dictatorship of the oppressive class, they cannot ultimately be divorced from the function of the executioner. Regarding this, we must divide into two, exposing their two faces and two methods that are mutually opposed and complementary. We must never be deceived by temporary and local appearances. Examining Hai Rui, wasn't he precisely advocating both severe punishment of the "ringleaders" and "reforming hearts and propagating civilization" in the "Petition for Pacifying the Li" and the "Strategies for Governing the Li," that is, so-called suppression and appeasement? Didn't he precisely advocate "using troops to pacify the people, going hand in hand without contradicting each other"?
    Precisely because Hai Rui had to both maintain feudal exploitation and prevent driving the peasants to rebellion, and because these two were ultimately irreconcilable contradictions, the role he played in history could not but be a "tragic" one, ending in failure. Hai Rui said in the "Petition of Self-Indictment": "I have dedicated my heart to repaying the emperor, and among all the officials, none should be like me." He also said: "I want to use my body as a barrier to turn back the raging tide that has already fallen; use my body as a beacon to open the gate to the restoration of antiquity." But no matter how brazen he was, no matter how strong his spirit of "dedication" to the feudal dynasty was, in the end, it was of no avail. More than fifty years after his death, the peasants still went to "Liangshan" after all, the Ming Zhu dynasty was overthrown, and Hai Rui himself was nothing more than a negligible pitiful worm in the development of history!
      Eclecticism Cannot Masquerade as One Divides into Two
    Whether the above analysis is appropriate is, of course, open to discussion. But in any case, we must never agree with some comrades who, under the guise of "one divides into two," say that "all things have their duality, that is, the distinction between good and bad. There are always good people in a bad group, and there are always bad people in a good group." ("'Upright Officials' and Corrupt Officials Have Good and Bad Distinctions," Wenhui Bao, January 27, 1966) It should be known that although things in the world do have duality, because the nature of the contradictions is different, "duality" does not always manifest itself as the distinction between good and bad. And more importantly, what is "good" and what is "bad" have different interpretations for different classes. Those who abandon class analysis and make the above arguments, vaguely and generally speaking of "good" and "bad," will inevitably lead to relativism and eclecticism, leading to half good and half bad, this is right and wrong, that is right and wrong, blurring the distinction between right and wrong, thereby covering up the essence of things.
    Using eclecticism to replace the dialectics of one divides into two is not an accidental phenomenon, and we should be vigilant. Lenin said,
  "When Marxism is changed into opportunism, it is easiest to deceive the masses by using eclecticism to masquerade as dialectics. In this way, people can feel a sense of pseudo-satisfaction, as if all aspects of the process, all trends of development, all contradictory influences, etc., have been taken into account..." Is it not precisely to express that they are seemingly impartial, fair, and just, and thus better "deceive the masses" that some comrades are vigorously begging for eclecticism and insisting that Hai Rui has both a "good" side and a bad side?

    一分为二看“清官”
    孙光萱　刘钝文
    提要：“清官”既要维护封建剥削制度，又要防止把农民逼上梁山。他们既是刽子手，又是骗子手。认为“清官”既有坏的一面，又有好的一面，这不是一分为二，而是折衷主义。
        “清官”可以一分为二
    在关于《海瑞罢官》的讨论中，不少人打着一分为二的幌子，来美化海瑞，为吴晗同志的错误作辩护。吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中说：“在思想认识上，主观地要突出海瑞好的一面，越写越片面……只讲优点，少讲或不讲缺点，把海瑞写成一个封建时代非常高大、完整无缺的政治家。”这就是说，海瑞既有好的一面，也有坏的一面。蒋星煜同志也这样质问：“我们感到困难的，是对海瑞应怎样一分为二？”“对具体历史人物是否适用一分为二？一分为二是否普遍真理？”“有的说肯定海瑞为封建统治阶级服务，否定海瑞为人民做了好事。这样说当然很对，是否就是一分为二的提法？”（《文汇报》一九六六年一月七日座谈纪要）看来，他们以为只要这么问上几下，就可以狠狠地将对方一军，使对方再也开口不得。
    是的，一分为二既然是事物最普遍、最一般的规律，当然也完全适用于分析“清官”，问题在于如何对“清官”一分为二。
    世界上的事物纷繁复杂，千变万化，它们由各种不同的矛盾所构成，因此，一分为二也就必然有其无限多的表现形式，也即是说，每一具体事物的一分为二，都必然通过具体的特殊的形式表现出来。能不能正确地对具体事物进行具体分析，并不是单纯的方法问题，而首先要看你是站在什么阶级立场和用什么观点去进行分析。对于“清官”只有站稳坚定的无产阶级立场，用马克思主义的一分为二的观点进行分析，才能够拨开历代封建统治阶级制造的重重迷雾，还“清官”以本来面目。
      怎样对“清官”一分为二
    要对“清官”作一分为二的分析，首先必须从分析“清官”的本质和特点入手。“清官”的本质和其他一切官吏一样，都是封建统治阶级压迫剥削人民的工具；而“清官”又有其特点：既要忠君，又要“安民”，即既要维护封建剥削制度，又要防止把农民逼上梁山。以海瑞而论，他一直以“必求仰副皇上求治之心”自许，所以他不惜“昧死竭惓惓为陛下一言之”，向嘉靖帝上《治安疏》。可以说“忠君”是他全部言行的出发点。而他的“安民”，不过是考虑到“民为邦本，本固邦宁”，为了更好地忠君，更好地求封建王朝“万世治安”而已。所以他一方面积极强化封建统治：大力推行保甲制，巩固封建政权的基层组织，整军修城，对人民实行严格的控制；另方面他又反对封建统治阶级内部的某些人“欲为目前苟安之图，不思万世无穷之利”，反对“竭泽而渔”，直言不讳地说，“竭泽而渔，非不得鱼，明年无鱼”，费尽心机防止把农民逼上梁山。
    吴晗同志是怎样看海瑞的呢？他认为海瑞是“有意识地办了一些好事”，海瑞的所作所为既是“和封建统治阶级的长远利益一致的，也是和被压迫被剥削的广大人民当前利益一致的”。吴晗同志在这里犯了两个严重的错误。第一，海瑞防止把农民逼上梁山，其实恰恰意味着加强对农民的控制，使农民听凭统治阶级尽情剥削，日夜挣扎在死亡线上。列宁曾经尖锐地指责那些肆意美化大地主的资产阶级人士：“你们不明白，你们不是把奴隶变成革命家，而是把奴隶变成奴才了。”在相隔四百年之后，吴晗同志居然还是念念不忘地说海瑞等清官“有意识地办了一些好事”，这不是在宣扬奴才哲学吗？第二，海瑞的某些措施，也许能够做到一时一地的“安民”，但他既然一心是要强化封建统治，到头来仍不免连某些暂时的“甜头”也在事实上化为乌有，仍不免把农民逼上梁山。例如海瑞强迫农民与“矿徒穷民”为敌，并贴告示威胁说，“不死于敌，必死于法。死敌为忠义士，死法为愚顽民”，就是一例。吴晗同志有什么理由对这些所谓“好事”毫无保留地大加吹嘘，一厢情愿地把这些所谓“好事”看作是农民不折不扣得到的“果实”呢？这不是蓄意颠倒黑白、混淆是非、宣扬对统治阶级的幻想吗？
    正因为海瑞既要维护封建剥削，又要防止把农民逼上梁山，所以表现在他的“政绩”上，一个显著的特点就是善于对人民采用反革命的两手策略，他往往软硬兼施，一身而兼任骗子和刽子手。当着劳动人民还没有被逼上梁山的时候，海瑞是用“软”的姿态出现，但一旦他们被“逼上梁山”，起而反抗，海瑞就立刻主张“罪不容诛”，说什么“诏开十恶及强盗重罪不赦，可也”。现在有些人认为“清官”只是使用“软”的一手，甚至只是意味着对农民的“让步”，这是受了统治阶级的欺骗。列宁说过：“所有一切压迫阶级，为了维持自己的统治，都需要有两种社会职能：一种是刽子手的职能，另一种是牧师的职能”。作为一个压迫阶级来说是如此，作为压迫阶级专政工具的“清官”来说，也终究不能与刽子手的职能绝缘。对此，我们必须一分为二，揭露他们相反相成、互为表里的两副脸孔，两种手段，决不能为一时一地的假象所惑。验之于海瑞其人，他不正是在《平黎疏》、《治黎策》中主张既要严惩“首恶”，又要“革心宣化”，即所谓剿抚并施吗？他不正是主张“用兵安民，并行不悖”吗？
    正因为海瑞既要维护封建剥削，又要防止把农民逼上梁山，而这两者归根结蒂又是无法调和的矛盾，所以他在历史上所扮演的不能不是一个“悲剧”的角色，以失败告终。海瑞在《自陈不职疏》中说：“矢心图报，群臣中当莫有如臣者矣。”又说：“欲以身为障，回既倒之狂澜；以身为标，开复古之门路。”可是尽管他多么大言不惭，尽管他对于封建王朝有多么强烈的“献身”精神，到头来却全然无济于事。在他死后五十多年，农民毕竟还是上了“梁山”，明朱王朝覆灭了，而海瑞本人，也不过是历史发展中无足轻重的一个可怜虫！
      折衷主义不能冒充一分为二
    以上分析是否恰当，当然可以商榷。但是无论如何，我们决不能同意某些同志以“一分为二”作幌子，说什么“凡事物总有其两重性，亦即好坏之分。一个坏的集团内也总有好的人，一个好集团内也总有坏的。”（《“清官”、贪官有好坏之分》，《文汇报》一九六六年一月二十七日）须知世界上的事物固然都有两重性，但由于矛盾性质不同，“两重性”并不永远表现为好坏之分。而且更为重要的是，什么是“好”，什么是“坏”，不同的阶级有着不同的解释。撇开了阶级分析而持上述论调的人，那样含含糊糊地笼而统之地侈言什么“好”“坏”，这就势必导致相对主义和折衷主义，导致好坏参半，此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，是非不分，从而掩盖事物的本质。
    用折衷主义来代替一分为二的辩证法，不是偶然的现象，我们应当有所警惕。列宁说过，
  “把马克思主义改为机会主义的时候，用折衷主义冒充辩证法是最容易欺骗群众的。这样能使人感到一种似是而非的满足，似乎考虑到了过程的一切方面，发展的一切趋势，一切相互矛盾的影响等等……”某些同志之所以起劲地乞灵于折衷主义，硬说海瑞既有什么“好”的一面，也有坏的一面，不正是为了表白自己仿佛不偏不倚，平正公允，从而更好地“欺骗群众”吗？
