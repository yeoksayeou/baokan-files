    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, March 11th. The Central Delegation, led by Zeng Shan, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Internal Affairs, arrived in the earthquake center of the Xingtai area of Hebei Province on the 10th, divided into five routes, to convey the sincere regards of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council to the people in the disaster areas. The Central Delegation included heads of various central ministries, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Beijing Municipality. When they arrived in the villages affected by the earthquake with medicines, food, tents, and other relief supplies, they were warmly welcomed by the local people. Supporting the old and leading the young, people gathered at the entrance of the villages, and many excitedly shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Please rest assured, Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to overcome the disaster and difficulties!"
    Wherever the delegation went, they held mass meetings or cadre symposiums to understand the disaster situation and guide the people to overcome the disaster. The delegation was pleased to see that the injured and sick had been treated and the people's lives had been initially arranged. The delegation also highly praised the revolutionary spirit displayed by the local people and cadres in the struggle against the disaster, relief efforts, and reconstruction of their homes, encouraging everyone to stand tall in the face of the disaster, work hard, and rebuild their homes in a better way. The delegation members also visited many commune members' families, comforted the injured and sick, and inquired in detail about their suffering, difficulties, and demands. Many elderly commune members, with tears in their eyes, held the delegation members' hands for a long time. They said: "Thank you, Chairman Mao, for your concern. Chairman Mao always remembers us. If it were in the old society, we would never be able to recover from such a major disaster." Some said: "With the Party and Chairman Mao backing us, we are not afraid of any disaster, no matter how big." Some said with passion: "Parents are dear, but the Party and Chairman Mao are even dearer; a thousand things are good, but socialism is better."
    The Central Delegation also met with representatives of the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters, medical personnel, cadres, workers, and students who participated in the disaster relief, expressed satisfaction with their work, and encouraged them to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of serving the people, overcome difficulties together with the people in the disaster areas, and strive for the complete victory of the disaster relief work.

Some soldiers said: "Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people well. Now, as long as we can relieve the people's suffering, we are not afraid of any hardship or fatigue." Some troops marched more than a hundred li day and night, arrived at the scene first, and immediately devoted themselves to the disaster relief work with high class feelings. After a unit got off the train near the disaster area, they ran into the disaster-stricken villages to rescue the injured.

The medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army rescued the wounded, and many moving deeds emerged. The local people were deeply moved. They said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of the people, and the People's Liberation Army are our closest relatives."

After the medical personnel of Shijiazhuang "Bethune International Peace Hospital" arrived in the severely affected villages, some bandaged the wounds of the commune members, and some built houses. Many people worked for a day and a night, forgetting to eat and rest. Now there is enough medical force in the disaster area, and the injured have been treated two or three times. In addition to working in the heavily affected areas, they also organized medical teams to conduct mobile medical services in the lightly affected areas. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and other relevant departments also sent veterinary medical teams to the disaster area.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee sent a large number of cadres to the disaster area to strengthen the leadership of grassroots work. They publicized the concern of the Party and the government for the disaster area to the masses, and organized the masses to arrange their lives and restore production. After many leading cadres came to the disaster area, they personally carried the wounded on their backs, built houses, and brought water and food to the commune members. The broad masses of cadres and the masses shared weal and woe, which greatly encouraged the masses. Now the lives of the people in the disaster area and the production in the disaster area are rapidly recovering.

    各方面发扬革命集体主义精神热情支援地震灾区
    灾区人民说：“千好万好，不如社会主义好。”“有党和毛主席，有解放军，天塌下来也不怕。”“请党中央和毛主席放心，我们一定能够战胜灾害和困难！”
    新华社邢台十一日电　由中共中央委员、内务部部长曾山率领的中央慰问团，十日分成五路，到达河北省邢台地区地震中心地带，代表党中央、毛主席和国务院，向灾区人民进行亲切的慰问。中央慰问团包括中央各部、中国人民解放军以及北京市的负责人。他们带着药品、食物、帐篷和其它慰问品到达遭受地震灾害的村庄时，受到当地群众极其热烈的欢迎。人们扶老携幼，齐集村头，许多人激动地高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“请党中央和毛主席放心，我们一定能够战胜灾害和困难！”
    慰问团每到一地，都召开了群众会或干部座谈会，了解灾情，指导人民战胜灾害。慰问团到达灾区时，看到伤病人员得到救治，人民的生活初步得到安排，感到满意。慰问团还高度赞扬了当地群众和干部在抗灾救灾和重建家园斗争中所发扬的革命精神，勉励大家在灾害面前挺起腰杆，艰苦奋斗，把家园重新建设得更加美好。慰问团人员还访问了许多社员的家庭，慰问了伤病人员，详细了解了他们的疾苦、困难和要求。许多老年社员噙着泪花，拉着代表团团员久久不放。他们说：“谢谢毛主席费心，毛主席总是记着我们的，要是在旧社会，遇到这样大的灾，我们就会永远翻不了身。”有的说：“有党和毛主席撑腰，不管多大的灾害也吓不倒我们。”有的满怀激情地说：“爹亲娘亲，不如党和毛主席亲；千好万好，不如社会主义好。”
    中央慰问团还会见了参加救灾的人民解放军指战员、医疗人员、干部、工人和学生的代表，对他们的工作表示满意，勉励他们继续发扬为人民服务的革命精神，同灾区人民一起克服困难，争取救灾工作的完全胜利。
    新华社邢台十一日电　河北省邢台地区发生强烈地震后，受到中共中央、国务院、中共中央华北局和中国人民解放军的亲切关怀和各方面的大力支援。这种一方有难各方支援的革命集体主义精神，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    地震发生后，附近的中国人民解放军指战员立即奉命赶赴灾区。有的战士说：“毛主席教导我们要好好为人民服务，现在只要能解除人民的疾苦，我们再苦再累也不怕。”有的部队昼夜兼程行军一百多里，最先到达现场，并且满怀高度的阶级感情立即投入救灾工作。有一支部队在灾区附近下车后，跑步进入受灾村庄救护受伤人员。有的指战员宁肯自己饿着，把带的干粮送给受灾的群众；有的宁肯挨冻，把自己的衣服让给群众。解放军的医务人员为群众救死扶伤，出现了许多动人事迹，当地群众深深感动，他们说：“共产党毛主席是人民的救星，解放军是最亲的亲人。”“有党和毛主席，有解放军，天塌下来也不怕。”人民解放军还调拨了各种物资和交通工具供灾区使用。在解放军的帮助下，一些受灾严重的村庄，社员们很快就住进了新修起的简易房屋。
    四天来，中央有关各部门和河北省的有关部门，已将救灾急需的各种物资运到灾区。这些物资包括医疗器材、药品、食品、建筑材料、炊具、通讯器材等等。许多部门派出负责人到灾区指导救灾工作，并且采取最迅速的办法调运人民所需要的物品，解决灾区的困难。
    天津、北京以及灾区附近城市大批医务人员，在地震发生后迅速赶到受灾地区。来自不同地区的医务人员，刚到现场，彼此还不知道姓名和工作单位，便自动搭配起来，有的当医生，有的当护士，有的修盖简易病房，很快建起了“战地医院”。石家庄“白求恩国际和平医院”的医务人员赶到受灾严重的村庄后，有的给社员包扎伤口，有的修建房屋，许多人工作了一天一夜，忘记了吃饭和休息。现在灾区已有了足够的医疗力量，受伤的人已经治疗了两三遍。他们除了在重灾区进行工作外，还组织医疗队到轻灾区巡回医疗。另外，农业部及其他有关部门还派出兽医医疗队赶到灾区。
    中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会派出了大批干部到达灾区，加强对基层工作的领导。他们向群众宣传党和政府对灾区的关怀，组织群众安排生活和恢复生产。许多领导干部来到灾区以后，亲自背扶伤员，修盖房屋，给社员端水送饭。广大干部和群众同甘共苦，使群众受到很大鼓舞。现在灾区人民的生活和灾区的生产正在迅速恢复中。
    新华社十一日讯　河北省邢台地区发生强烈地震的消息传到北京后，北京市人民极为关切。在中共中央、国务院的统一领导和部署下，中共北京市委和市人民委员会迅速组织人力和运送物资支援灾区人民，并派市委常委、副市长崔月犁和卫生局副局长阎毅等带领医疗队，代表中共北京市委、北京市人民委员会和北京市人民随中央慰问团前往灾区慰问和支援抗灾。
    为了抢救灾区受伤群众，北京市组织医疗队赶赴灾区，同时运去了急需的药品、医疗器械和救护车。第一批医疗队在地震发生的当天下午就出发了。医务人员到达灾区后，克服了种种困难，为抢救阶级兄弟忘我地工作。
    北京市其他有关单位也积极地支援灾区群众。农林局派出了畜牧医疗队。人民解放军北京卫戍区和北京市商业局、环境卫生局等单位连夜准备出救灾物资，并且派出司机和工人一同前往灾区。人民解放军空军驻京单位、北京铁路局、北京市交通运输局等部门通力合作，连夜组织运输，把参加救灾的人员和救灾物资迅速运往灾区。中央在京所属医疗单位和解放军驻京医疗单位也组织了医疗队前往灾区。
