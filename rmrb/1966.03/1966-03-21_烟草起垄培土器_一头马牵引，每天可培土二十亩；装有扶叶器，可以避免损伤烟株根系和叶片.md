    Tobacco Ridging and Hilling Machine
    Pulled by a single horse, it can hill twenty mu per day; equipped with leaf lifters to avoid damaging tobacco roots and leaves.
    The newly designed and trial-manufactured tobacco ridging and hilling machine in Shandong has recently been put into small-scale production.
    This hilling machine is mainly used for ridging and hilling tobacco. It can adjust the working width and can cut off covering weeds. The ridges it makes are rounded, and the soil on the ridges is loose, which is conducive to preserving moisture. This machine is also equipped with leaf lifters, which will not damage the roots and leaves of tobacco plants during hilling. This tobacco hilling machine has low resistance; pulled by a single horse, it can hill twenty mu per day, increasing work efficiency by 6.6 times compared to manual hilling. This tobacco ridging and hilling machine was jointly researched and designed by the Changwei Agricultural Machinery Research Institute and the Tobacco Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

    烟草起垄培土器
    一头马牵引，每天可培土二十亩；装有扶叶器，可以避免损伤烟株根系和叶片
    山东新设计试制的烟草起垄培土器已在最近小批地投入生产。
    这种培土器主要是用在烟草的起垄培土作业上，能调节工作幅宽，并且可以切除覆盖杂草。它起的垄是漫圆形的，垄上土壤疏松，便于保墒。在这种机具上还装有扶叶器，在培土过程中不会损伤烟株根系和叶片。这种烟草培土器阻力较小，用一头马牵引每天可培土二十亩，比人工培土工效提高六点六倍。这种烟草起垄培土器，是昌潍农业机械科学研究所跟中国农业科学院烟草研究所共同研究设计的。
