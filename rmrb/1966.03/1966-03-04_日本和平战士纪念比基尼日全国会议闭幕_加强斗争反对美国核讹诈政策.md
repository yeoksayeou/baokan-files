    Japanese Peace Fighters Commemorate Bikini Day at National Conference Closing
    Strengthen Struggle Against US Nuclear Blackmail Policy
    "Akahata" Exposes Sato Government's Intensified Revival of Japanese Militarism
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd dispatch: The "National Conference Against the War of Aggression in Vietnam, to Stop Nuclear War, for the Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and to Aid Atomic Bomb Victims," held in Shizuoka City, Japan, victoriously concluded on the afternoon of the 2nd. This conference, commemorating Bikini Day (March 1st), angrily condemned the US aggression against Vietnam and expressed resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle.
    More than four thousand peace fighters from all over Japan participated in this closing meeting.
    The meeting was hosted by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikyo). Council Representative Director Masaharu Hatanaka, in his speech to the conference, pointed out that US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Sato government's participation in this aggression are the root cause of the current tense situation. Hatanaka said that it is necessary to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle.
    Other representatives who spoke at the meeting emphasized the demand for the US military to voluntarily withdraw from Vietnam. They expressed their determination to persist in the struggle until the Japan-US "Security Treaty" is abolished.
    The resolution unanimously adopted by the conference called for continuing to raise the banner of the anti-atomic bomb movement, strengthening the struggle to oppose the aggressive and nuclear blackmail policies of US imperialism, and opposing the US war of aggression against Vietnam. The resolution also called for vigorously carrying out actions in support of the Vietnamese people.
    Telegrams from the Peace Committees and the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, from groups in South Vietnam Liberation areas, and from Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk were read at the meeting. After the meeting, all participants held a demonstration.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," revealed on the 2nd that the Japanese Sato government, the Liberal Democratic Party, and monopoly capital groups are making every effort to revive militarism in all aspects of Japan.
    The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party are conspiring to accelerate the revision of the Japanese Constitution, abolishing the clauses prohibiting the use of war as a means. They are also attempting to establish a one-party rule by establishing a "small constituency system." The government is heavily promoting the "small constituency system" with the aim of redrawing electoral districts to increase the chances of Liberal Democratic Party candidates being elected.
    In addition, the Sato government is strengthening its suppression of activities against the revival of militarism. The "Self-Defense Forces" completed the redeployment of the army last year, making preparations and arrangements for suppressing the people, and conducted large-scale exercises to suppress the people in Hokkaido, Gunma, and Kyushu in October last year.
    At the same time, the "Defense Agency" has been studying and formulating the "Emergency State Law" since August of last year. And the establishment of a wartime system is precisely part of Japan's "Three Arrows Operation Plan" and the Third Expansion Plan. Starting this year, the "Self-Defense Forces" also plans to station a large number of helicopters and armored vehicles around various cities to suppress the people.
    The Japanese authorities are conspiring to revise the current criminal law in order to abuse fabricated charges such as espionage and rebellion to persecute democratic forces.
    The Sato government and monopoly capital are preparing to promote militarism among the people. The "Defense Agency" has increased its publicity funds for "strengthening national defense awareness" to 266 million yen in 1966, an increase of 64 million yen compared to last year. The Japan Monopoly Capital Organization also established a "Defense Roundtable" last autumn, conducting militaristic propaganda throughout the country. (Attached picture)

    日本和平战士纪念比基尼日全国会议闭幕
    加强斗争反对美国核讹诈政策
    《赤旗报》揭露佐藤政府加紧复活日本军国主义
    新华社三日讯东京消息：在日本静冈市举行的“反对侵越战争、阻止核战争、全面禁止核武器和救济原子弹受害者全国会议”二日下午胜利闭幕。这次纪念比基尼日（三月一日）的会议愤怒谴责美国侵略越南，并且表示坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争。
    四千多名由日本各地来的和平战士参加了这次闭幕会议。
    会议是由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会主持的。协议会代表理事畑中政春在大会上讲话时指出，美帝国主义对越南的侵略和佐藤政府参与这场侵略，是目前紧张局势的根源。畑中说，必须坚决支持越南人民的斗争。
    在会上发言的其他代表在讲话中强调要求美国军队主动撤出越南。他们表示要决心坚持斗争，直到废除日美
  “安全条约”为止。
    会议一致通过的决议号召继续举起反对原子弹运动的旗帜，加强斗争，以反对美帝国主义的侵略和核讹诈政策，反对美国侵略越南的战争。决议还号召大力开展声援越南人民的行动。
    会上宣读了由中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的和平委员会及亚非团结委员会发出的、由越南南方解放区的团体发出的、和柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王发出的电报。会后，全体与会者举行了示威游行。
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》二日揭露，日本佐藤政府、自由民主党和垄断资本集团正竭力在日本各个方面复活军国主义。
    日本政府和自由民主党正在阴谋加速修改日本宪法，废除禁止采用战争手段的条款。它们还企图通过设立“小选区制度”来确立一党统治。政府正在大事宣传“小选区制度”，目的是要重划选区，以便增加自由民主党候选人当选的机会。
    此外，佐藤政府正在加强镇压反对复活军国主义的活动。“自卫队”去年完成了军队的重新部署，作了镇压人民的准备和安排，并且在去年十月在北海道、群马和九州等地进行了大规模的镇压人民的演习。
    与此同时，“防卫厅”从去年八月以来就一直在研究制订“紧急状态法”的问题。而建立战时体制，正是日本的“三矢作战计划”和第三次扩军计划的一部分。从今年开始，“自卫队”还计划在各城市周围派驻大批直升飞机和装甲车来镇压人民。
    日本当局正在阴谋修改目前的刑法，以便滥用间谍、叛乱等捏造的罪名，来迫害民主力量。
    佐藤政府和垄断资本准备在人民中间宣传军国主义。“防卫厅”把一九六六年度用于“加强国防意识”的宣传经费增加到二亿六千六百万日元，这比去年增加六千四百万日元。日本垄断资本组织去年秋天也成立了一个“防务座谈会”，在全国各地进行军国主义宣传。（附图片）
