    The courageous act of the patriotic officers and soldiers of the First Armored Regiment of the South Vietnamese puppet army in staging an uprising is commendable and represents an important trend.
    The US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has not only awakened the Vietnamese people to take up arms and wage a resolute struggle against the invaders, but has also made more and more patriotic officers and soldiers in the puppet army realize the truth, turn their guns around, and stand on the side of the people to jointly strike at the US aggressors and their lackeys.
    In a people's war, disintegrating the enemy's army is a major task. Chairman Mao once pointed out: "Our victory depends not only on the operations of our army, but also on the disintegration of the enemy's army." The Chinese people's war has proven this, and the South Vietnamese people's war is also proving this.
    The South Vietnamese puppet army is forced by the US aggressors onto the battlefield to massacre their own compatriots. The contradiction between them and US imperialism and a handful of traitors will become increasingly acute. Under the blows, efforts to win over, and division of the people's armed forces, the puppet army is disintegrating rapidly. Many of them can gradually realize that this is an unjust war, that it is a crime against the people, and that if they continue down this path, it will lead to a dead end. They cannot but consider finding a way out, and the only way out is to abandon the darkness and seek the light, and join the ranks of the struggle against US aggression and for national salvation.
    The uprising of the First Armored Regiment of the South Vietnamese puppet army is a new symbol, marking the rapid disintegration of the South Vietnamese puppet army, thereby accelerating the complete defeat of the US aggressors.

    重要的动向
    南越伪军第一装甲团爱国官兵举行起义的勇敢行为，是值得赞扬的事情，也是一个重要的动向。
    美帝国主义的侵越战争，不仅唤醒了越南人民拿起枪杆同侵略者进行坚决的斗争，而且也使越来越多的伪军中的爱国官兵觉悟过来，掉转枪口，站到人民方面来，共同打击美国侵略者及其走狗。
    在人民战争中，瓦解敌军是一项重大工作。毛主席曾指出：“我们的胜利不但是依靠我军的作战，而且依靠敌军的瓦解”。中国人民战争证明了这一点，南越人民战争也正在证明这一点。
    南越伪军是被美国侵略者强迫驱上战场，屠杀自己的同胞的。他们同美帝国主义和一小撮卖国贼之间的矛盾，是会日益尖锐化的。在人民武装的打击、争取和分化下，伪军日益迅速瓦解，其中很多人能够逐步认识到这是不义之战，这是对人民的犯罪行为，并且如果再沿着这条道走下去，就是死路一条；他们就不能不考虑找一条生路，而唯一的生路，就是弃暗投明，站到抗美救国斗争的队伍中来。
    南越伪军第一装甲团的起义事件，是一个新的标志，它标志着南越伪军迅速瓦解，从而加速美国侵略者的彻底失败。
