    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - Soviet Ambassador to the United States Dobrynin signed a two-year cultural exchange agreement with the US government in Washington on the 19th, which is said to be "aimed at promoting understanding and improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union."
    This new cultural exchange agreement was reached after only two weeks of negotiations. Its main content includes exchanges in film, artistic performances, science, and agriculture between the two countries for the two years up to 1967.
    It is reported that this agreement was originally scheduled to be signed on the 16th, but was postponed because Johnson requested a review of the content of the agreement to ensure that all performance programs selected by the United States could be staged in the Soviet Union. The White House only decided on the 18th that the agreement was completely acceptable.
    After the agreement was signed, Dobrynin said: "Everything is going smoothly."

    苏美又作成一笔交易　签订新文化交流协定
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联驻美大使多勃雷宁十九日在华盛顿同美国政府签订了一项为期两年的、被称为
  “目标在于促进美苏两国之间的谅解和改善关系”的文化交流协定。
    这项新的文化交流协定只经过两周的谈判就达成了协议。它的主要内容包括：在到一九六七年为止的两年内两国在电影、艺术表演、科学和农业等方面进行交流活动。
    据报道，这个协定原来准备在十六日签字，但是由于约翰逊要求审查协定的内容，以保证所有由美国选择的演出节目都能在苏联上演而推迟，到十八日白宫才决定这项协议是完全可以接受的。
    协议签字后，多勃雷宁说：“一切进展顺利”。
