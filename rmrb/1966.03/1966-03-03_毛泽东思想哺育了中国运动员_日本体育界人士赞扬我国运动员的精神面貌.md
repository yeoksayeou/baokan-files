    Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures Chinese Athletes
    Japanese Sports Figures Praise the Mental Outlook of Chinese Athletes
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo)　Taro Kuramachi, a director of the Japan Skating Federation, and Zhouzuo Shimoyama, a coach, and others who led the Japanese men's and women's speed skating delegation on a visit to China, praised the rapid growth of Chinese skating athletes under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, who have entered the ranks of the world's excellent skating athletes.
    Taro Kuramachi told Chinese reporters in Tokyo on the 11th: Sports in China are not only valued by the country, but also by all the people. What impressed him most was that China carries out the education of Mao Zedong Thought among athletes very thoroughly. The slogans of "Strengthen the body, build the motherland, and defend the motherland," which can be seen everywhere on the sports field, have truly become the common goal of the vast number of athletes.
    Hirokazu Yano, an observer who accompanied the skating delegation, published an article in the "Mainichi Shimbun" on the 11th, saying: The level of Chinese skating athletes is much higher than originally thought. They have a kind of courage during the competition, which Japanese athletes do not have. Compared with Chinese athletes, it is not so much that Japanese athletes are physically weaker, but that their mental strength is even worse.

    毛泽东思想哺育了中国运动员
    日本体育界人士赞扬我国运动员的精神面貌
    据新华社东京电　率领日本男女速度滑冰代表团访问中国回来的日本滑冰协会理事仓町太郎和教练下山周作等，称赞中国滑冰运动员在毛泽东思想教育下迅速成长，已经进入世界优秀滑冰运动员的行列。
    仓町太郎十一日在东京对中国记者说：体育事业在中国不仅得到国家的重视，而且得到全体人民的重视。他感到印象最深刻的是，中国在运动员中进行毛泽东思想的教育，非常彻底。在运动场上到处可以看见的锻炼身体，建设祖国，保卫祖国等口号，真正成了广大运动员的共同目标。
    滑冰代表团随团观察员矢野博一在十一日的《每日新闻》发表文章说：中国滑冰运动员的水平比原来想的要高得多。他们在比赛时有一种魄力，这是日本运动员所没有的。同中国运动员比较，与其说日本运动员体力差，不如说精神力量更差。
