    Poverty of Blacks in Watts

    Watts is the "black residential area" of Los Angeles, an important city in the western United States. Los Angeles, located in California, is the largest city in the United States in terms of area, surpassing New York. In terms of population, it ranks third among American cities, after New York and Chicago. According to materials in the August 30, 1965 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," Los Angeles has a population of about 2.7 million, of which blacks number about 400,000 to 450,000. About 80,000 blacks live concentrated in Watts.

    In Watts, more than 35 percent of adults are unemployed. One-eighth are illiterate, and two-thirds of adults have not received secondary education. The annual income of black families in Watts is only half that of whites in other areas, and 60 percent of children live on welfare. Ninety percent of the houses in Watts were built before the war, and most are dilapidated.

    United Press International once reported on the tragic lives of blacks in Watts, as recounted by some Watts residents. One man from Watts said, "I have never seen any situation that can compare with it there (Watts)." A woman said, "What is needed here is food and sufficient housing. Most of the people in this area are at the very bottom and cannot enjoy due rights. Because of racial discrimination, our men cannot hold their heads up as real men because they cannot find work." A fourteen-year-old boy said, "Everyone should come to Los Angeles to see what is happening here. Under these circumstances, there is no other way but riots. During elections, officials come to tell us what they are going to do, but once the election is over, they refuse to see us." (Fan Wen)

    瓦茨区黑人的贫困
    瓦茨区是美国西部重要城市洛杉矶的“黑人聚居区”。洛杉矶位于加利福尼亚州，是美国面积最大的城市，超过纽约。依人口而论，则次于纽约、芝加哥，在美国城市中占第三位。据一九六五年八月三十日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》的材料，洛杉矶市人口约二百七十万，其中黑人约为四十万至四十五万。集中居住在瓦茨区的黑人约有八万多名。
    在瓦茨区，百分之三十五以上的成年人失业。文盲占八分之一，成年人中有三分之二没有受过中等教育。瓦茨区黑人家庭的每年收入只及其他地区白人收入的一半，百分之六十的儿童靠救济度日。瓦茨区的房屋百分之九十是战前造的，大多数已经破烂不堪。
    合众国际社曾经报道一些瓦茨区居民叙述瓦茨区黑人悲惨生活的情况。一个瓦茨区的男子说，“我从来没有看到任何情况是能同那里（瓦茨区）相比的”。一个妇女说，“这里所需要的就是食物和足够的住房。这个地区的大多数人民都是处于最下层和不能享有正当权利的。由于种族歧视，我们的男人都抬不起头来当真正的男子汉，因为他们无法找到工作。”一个十四岁的男孩子说，“每个人都应当到洛杉矶来看看这里所发生的情况。在这种情况之下，除了暴乱就没有别的办法。在选举时期，官员们来告诉我们他们要干些什么事情，但是选举一过他们就不肯见我们了。”　　（凡文）
