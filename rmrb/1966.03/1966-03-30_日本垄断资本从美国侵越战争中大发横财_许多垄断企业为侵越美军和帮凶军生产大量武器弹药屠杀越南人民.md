    (Dispatch from our newspaper) U.S. imperialism not only turns Japan into an important military base for launching aggressive wars in Asia, but also turns Japan into an arsenal and weapons depot in Asia.

    Today, as the United States continues to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. "special procurement" orders from Japanese enterprises have surged, and are of diverse types, such as military vehicles like trucks, engines, parts like tires, electrical appliances like generators for base construction, timber, shaped steel for port construction, materials for constructing positions, communications equipment, military uniforms, jungle equipment, weapons, ammunition, etc., without exception. "Special procurement" orders related to the repair of warships, aircraft, tanks, etc. in Japan are also increasing rapidly. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, U.S. "special procurement" orders for the war of aggression against Vietnam in January of this year reached $4.76 million, about four times the same period last year.

    In order to make a fortune from the war, Japanese monopoly enterprises are all scrambling for U.S. military "special procurement" orders. Large monopoly enterprises such as "Mitsui & Co.," "Hitachi Cable," and "Mitsubishi Electric" have produced small-scale power generation equipment sets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for the invading U.S. military to strengthen its forward bases. Large monopoly enterprises such as "Mitsui & Co.," "Nakamoto Shoji," and "Ishikawa Industry" supplied the invading U.S. military with 8.9 million sandbags for constructing positions. Companies such as "Mitsui & Co." and "Mitsubishi Corporation" also supplied the invading U.S. military with a large amount of barbed wire installed around U.S. military barracks and airfields. In addition to jungle boots, Japanese chemical companies also produce a large number of explosives for the invading U.S. military. "Toyota Motor" and "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries" produced military vehicles such as trucks and jeeps for the invading U.S. military, and transported them to South Vietnam on landing craft operated by Japanese sailors.

    U.S. military aircraft damaged by the Vietnamese people in the war of aggression against Vietnam are repaired by large Japanese monopoly enterprises. The Gifu plant of "Kawasaki Aircraft" repairs B-52 strategic bombers and C-130 large transport aircraft for the U.S. military. The Komaki factory of "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries" repairs F-102 jet fighters for the U.S. Air Force base in Da Nang, South Vietnam. The Atsugi plant of "Japan Aircraft" repairs jet fighters damaged in sorties from aircraft carriers of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

    Despite strict secrecy, the fact that Japanese arms factories are producing large quantities of weapons and ammunition for the U.S. military is constantly being revealed. Last August, the U.S. Christian Science Monitor reported that "at least 90 percent of the napalm bombs dropped by U.S. aircraft in Vietnam are purchased from two companies in Japan."

    Japanese arms companies not only directly manufacture weapons and equipment for the invading U.S. military, but also export large quantities of arms to U.S. lackeys in Asia. Last year, Japan's "Howa Machinery" company exported 5,000 automatic rifles and 2.5 million rounds of ammunition to Thailand. Thailand is still importing 5,000 automatic rifles from Japan this year. It is said that Thailand intends to purchase 40,000 to 45,000 automatic rifles from Japan in the future. It is worth noting that the number of helicopters exported by the Japanese aircraft manufacturing industry to Thailand has been increasing year by year in recent years. "Kawasaki Aircraft" alone will export five helicopters with strong combat capabilities to Thailand.

    Australia and the Philippines, which are serving the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, have ordered complete sets of equipment for arms production, machine guns, small rockets, etc. from major Japanese monopoly enterprises. In particular, the Philippines is negotiating with "Fuji Heavy Industries" and "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries" to purchase 20 to 30 jet aircraft and helicopters.

    In addition, "Kawasaki Aircraft" has also accepted orders from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan and Israel for "MAT" anti-tank missiles. "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries" has also accepted an order from India for tanks. It is not difficult to imagine that in the future, as U.S. imperialism intensifies its instigation of its Asian lackeys to expand their military preparations, their orders to Japanese arms dealers will continue to increase.

### 日本垄断资本从美国侵越战争中大发横财  许多垄断企业为侵越美军和帮凶军生产大量武器弹药屠杀越南人民

    日本垄断资本从美国侵越战争中大发横财
    许多垄断企业为侵越美军和帮凶军生产大量武器弹药屠杀越南人民
    本报讯  美帝国主义不仅把日本变成它在亚洲发动侵略战争的重要军事基地，而且把日本变成亚洲的兵工厂和武器库。
    在美国不断扩大侵越战争的今天，美国对日本企业的“特需”订货激增，而且种类繁多，诸如卡车等军用车辆、引擎、轮胎等部件，基地建设用的发电机等电气器具、木材，港湾建设用的型钢，构筑阵地用的器材，通讯器材，军服，丛林装备，武器弹药等等，一应俱全。有关在日本修理军舰、飞机、坦克等的“特需”订货也在急剧增加。据日本通商产业省的统计，今年一月美国侵越战争“特需”订货达四百七十六万美元，约为上一年同期的四倍。
    日本大垄断企业为了发战争横财，对于美军“特需”订货无不趋之若鹜。“三井物产”、“日立电线”、“三菱电机”等大垄断企业，生产了数十万美元的小型发电成套设备，供侵越美军加强前线基地使用。“三井物产”、“中本商事”、“石川产业”等大垄断企业，给侵越美军供应了八百九十万个构筑阵地用的砂袋。“三井物产”、“三菱商事”等公司，还为侵越美军供应了大量设在美军兵营和飞机场周围的铁丝网。日本的化工企业除了丛林靴以外，还为侵越美军生产大批炸药。“丰田汽车”、“三菱重工业”两公司，为侵越美军生产卡车、吉普车等军用车辆，并且用有日本海员操作的登陆艇运到南越去。
    在侵越战争中被越南人民打伤的美国军用飞机，是在日本的大垄断企业修理的。“川崎航空”公司岐阜制作所，为美军修理B—52型战略轰炸机和C—130型大型运输机。“三菱重工业”公司小牧工厂，为南越岘港美空军基地修理F—102喷气式战斗机。“日本飞行机”公司厚木制作所，为美国第七舰队的航空母舰修理因出击受伤的喷气式战斗机等。
    尽管严守秘密，但日本军火工厂在为美军生产大量武器弹药的事实，也不断被透露出来。去年八月，美国《基督教科学箴言报》就报道说：“美国飞机在越南投下的凝固汽油弹，至少有百分之九十是从日本的两家企业采购来的。”
    日本的军火企业，不仅直接为侵越美军制造武器装备，而且向美国在亚洲的仆从出口大量军火。去年日本“丰和工业”公司向泰国出口五千支自动步枪和二百五十万发子弹。今年泰国仍从日本进口五千支自动步枪。据说，泰国今后想从日本采购四万至四万五千支自动步枪。值得注意的是，近年来日本飞机制造业向泰国出口的直升飞机逐年增加，仅“川崎航空”公司一家就要向泰国出口五架作战性能较强的直升飞机。
    为美国侵越战争效劳的澳大利亚、菲律宾，分别从日本的各大垄断企业订购军火生产的成套设备、机枪、小型火箭等。特别是菲律宾从“富士重工业”、“三菱重工业”两公司洽购二、三十架喷气式飞机和直升飞机。
    此外，“川崎航空”公司还接受台湾蒋介石匪帮和以色列关于反坦克用“MAT”型导弹的订货。“三菱重工业”公司还接受印度购买的坦克订货。不难设想，今后随着美帝国主义加紧唆使其亚洲仆从扩军备战，它们向日本军火商的订货还会不断增加。
