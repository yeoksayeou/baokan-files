    Engaging in Nursing Work with Revolutionary Spirit
    Zhou Yulan, Head Nurse of the Burn Ward, Beijing Children's Hospital

    I am an overseas Chinese who returned to China in 1953. The Party, in order to cultivate me, sent me to nursing school to study. In 1955, I was assigned to work as a nurse at the Children's Hospital. Over the past ten years, under the Party's nurturing and education and with the help of comrades, my class consciousness has continuously improved, making me fall in love with the nursing profession and determined to do nursing work for the rest of my life, serving the broad masses of the working people. Since 1960, I began to study Chairman Mao's works. Under Chairman Mao's teachings, especially after repeatedly studying articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I further understood that nursing work is revolutionary work, and to engage in revolution, one must serve the people wholeheartedly.

    Pediatric nursing work has many different characteristics from adult nursing work. Children, due to their young age, have weak resistance and rapid changes in their condition. Some cannot even speak and can only express their pain and demands through crying. Initially, I thought that crying was a normal phenomenon for children after getting sick. However, mothers understand their children particularly well, knowing why they are crying or laughing. I thought that as a pediatric nurse, I should also care for and comfort sick children like a mother. There was a sick overseas Chinese child named Yang Huilan who was hospitalized due to burns on her buttocks. After being hospitalized, the child felt everything was unfamiliar and her personality seemed very withdrawn. She didn't say a word for four or five days and didn't cooperate with the treatment. I started by understanding her eating habits to approach her. I remembered that overseas Chinese mostly liked to eat popsicles, so I asked her, "Do you like to eat popsicles?" Huilan nodded, and I was extremely happy. After work, with the doctor's consent, I bought her a popsicle. From then on, little Huilan slowly started to talk and also cooperated with the treatment. After the child recovered and was discharged from the hospital, her father wrote in the guestbook: "You are all thinking of the children in every way, which I have rarely seen. Only in New China, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, can there be such a moving new atmosphere." I thought that we had only done a little bit of work that we should do, but the parents associated it with the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the superiority of the socialist system. This made me further realize the revolutionary significance of nursing work; doing nursing work is doing revolution.

    Serving Sick Children, Serving Parents
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Our troops are entirely for the purpose of liberating the people and working thoroughly in the interests of the people." I realize that the core of this sentence lies in the words "entirely" and "thoroughly." Pediatric nursing work seems simple, and anyone can do it, but it is often not easy to achieve "entirely" and "thoroughly." Especially when there are many patients, heavy tasks, and tight schedules, it is easy to find it troublesome and do things perfunctorily. For example, feeding is a regular nursing task, but due to the torment of illness and the unfamiliar environment, some sick children often do not eat well, which requires us to patiently persuade and carefully help. We once cared for a sick child with severe burns on the face. The mouth was very swollen, and even a slight movement would cause severe pain. Her appetite was good, but it took about an hour to feed her a meal. At that time, the ward had a heavy workload, and we were all a little annoyed, fearing it would affect other work. Later, I thought that we were working for the interests of the people and should find ways to relieve the child's pain; also, as a Communist Party member, I should take the lead in overcoming difficulties, and put aside other work when it was time to feed her, and personally feed her. No matter how long it took, I had to make sure the child was full and well-fed.

    Changing dressings for burn patients is a delicate task, because dressing changes will bring considerable pain to the children. Some children have a very serious fear, not allowing medical staff to approach them. How can we resolve this contradiction and reduce the child's pain? I actively created conditions. On the one hand, I strictly required myself to be as gentle and careful as possible when changing dressings; on the other hand, I wanted to eliminate the child's fear, approaching them more often at ordinary times, and trying to divert the child's attention and reduce their pain during dressing changes. While changing dressings, I would chat with the children about their families, teach them songs, or have them do some interesting things, so that their energy was diverted, reducing the pain, and the dressing change was quickly completed.

    In order to prevent cross-infection, parents are not allowed to stay or visit in the ward. Therefore, many parents ask about the condition, sometimes a parent asks three or four times a day. When we are busy with work, we often show impatience, and our answers are not detailed enough. I thought, can this be considered wholeheartedly serving the people? With this question, I used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon, and the spirit of "never tire of taking things, never tire of answering questions" on the commercial front as a model, and compared and examined myself. I felt that my past attitude towards parents had not been "entirely" and "thoroughly" achieved. I one-sidedly thought that we were serving the sick children, and as long as we took good care of the children, it would be fine, without understanding that serving parents and serving sick children are consistent. Later, when parents inquired about the condition again, I would prepare in advance and patiently and carefully explain the condition, treatment, and effects, as well as the child's emotions, hobbies, and performance, and give necessary comfort. This was praised in letters from the parents of the sick children. Each letter from the parents motivates us to better improve our work and better serve the sick children and their parents.

    Red Heart Leads to Skillful Hands
    When the burn ward was first established, we encountered many problems in our nursing work that we could not solve. Sick children who have been lying in bed for a long time cannot turn over, often increasing pain due to the pressure of body weight on the wound surface, and it is also easy to develop bedsores; some sick children with burns on their lower body are also easily contaminated by feces and urine, causing bacterial infections, endangering their lives. At first, I just did it with enthusiasm. Seeing that the dressing was dirty, I would change it, not knowing how many times a day I changed the medicine. Not only was the child in pain, but the work was also very passive. All this told me that it is not enough to just want to do a good job; you must have a solid skill to serve the people. At first, when we saw that the wound surface was under pressure or soiled by feces and urine, we would fold the diaper and place it on the waist or legs, and place a curved plate to collect feces and urine to prevent pressure or contamination of the wound surface.

    Once, I had a backache and put a hot water bag under my waist when I slept, which felt very uncomfortable. This made me think that the child's waist must also feel uncomfortable with a few diapers under it. The child's pain is my pain. Therefore, in nursing, I paid attention to how the child should lie comfortably, without putting pressure on the wound surface, and also collecting feces and urine. After clinical practice, I summarized experience and lessons from success and failure. Finally, I and my comrades summarized ten lying positions that can be applied to various burn sites, and designed methods for collecting feces and urine for male and female patients based on the "Ten Lying Positions." This not only reduced the child's pain, but also reduced the chance of contamination, and was able to collect accurate urine volume, providing the doctor with a basis for observing and rescuing shock, and improving the quality of medical care.

    Burn patients are most afraid of Pseudomonas infection, especially Pseudomonas septicemia. Therefore, early prevention and early treatment of Pseudomonas infection has become an important task of the burn ward. How to recognize Pseudomonas? We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted in-depth investigation and research, understood the essence of things from practice, and found the rules. When some sick children showed Pseudomonas infection, we closely observed and paid attention to the subtle differences between them and ordinary sick children, carefully studying everything from the overall situation to the wound surface, from the smell to the color. Finally, we were able to identify sick children with Pseudomonas infection early. Whenever we found that the dressing turned blue-green and the wound surface emitted a special smell, we immediately isolated it without waiting for the bacterial culture results, and promptly cooperated with the doctor to take treatment measures to reduce the spread of Pseudomonas and the occurrence of Pseudomonas septicemia.

    In the ten years since returning to China, I have only done a little bit of work that I should have done. In the future, I must always remember Chairman Mao's words: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, learn from the experience of advanced units, learn from all the comrades in this ward, and constantly improve my ability to serve the people.

### 用革命精神从事护士工作

    用革命精神从事护士工作
    北京市儿童医院烧伤病房护士长  周玉兰
    我是一九五三年归国的华侨。党为了培养我，送我到护士学校学习。一九五五年分配到儿童医院作护士。十多年来在党的培养教育和同志们的帮助下，阶级觉悟不断提高，使我爱上了护士专业，决心干一辈子护士工作，为广大劳动人民服务。一九六○年以来，我开始学习毛主席著作。在毛主席的教导下，特别是在反复的学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》等文章之后，使我进一步懂得了护士工作就是革命工作，干革命，就要全心全意为人民服务。
    儿科护理工作和成人的护理工作有着许多不同的特点。孩子由于年龄小，抵抗力弱，病情变化快，有的还不会说话，只能用哭来表达痛苦和要求。开始我以为哭是孩子生病后的正常现象。然而母亲们却特别了解自己的孩子，哭笑都知道是为什么。我想，自己是一个儿科护士，也应该象妈妈那样去关心和体贴病儿。有一个叫杨惠兰的华侨病儿，因臀部烫伤住院。住院后，孩子觉得一切都很生疏，性情显得很孤僻，四五天都不说一句话，医疗上也不合作。我就从了解她的饮食习惯入手来接近她。我想起了华侨大都喜欢吃冰棍，我就问她：“你喜欢吃冰棍吗？”惠兰点头了，我高兴极了。下班后，取得医生的同意，就买来冰棍给她吃。从此以后，小惠兰慢慢开口了，在治疗上也合作了。孩子痊愈出院后，她的父亲在留言簿上写道：“你们处处为孩子着想，我从来少见。只有在新中国，在党和毛主席的领导下，才会有这样动人的新气象。”我想，我们只是做了自己应该做的一点点工作，家长却联想到这是党和毛主席的英明领导和社会主义制度的优越性。这使我进一步认识到护士工作的革命意义，干护士工作就是干革命。
    为病儿服务，为家长服务
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我体会这句话的中心是在“完全”“彻底”四个字上。儿科护理工作看来简单，谁都会做，但是，往往不容易做到“完全”“彻底”。特别是在病人多，任务重，工作紧张的时候，容易嫌麻烦，潦草从事。例如：喂饭，是一项经常性的护理工作，但是，由于疾病的折磨和环境的生疏，有些病儿常常不好好吃饭，这就需要我们耐心地说服和细心地帮助。我们曾护理一个面部严重烧伤的病儿，嘴肿的很厉害，稍微一动，就会引起剧烈的疼痛。她的食欲很好，喂她一顿饭需要一个小时左右。当时病房任务很重，我们思想上都有些嫌麻烦，怕影响别的工作。后来我想，我们是为着人民利益而工作的，应该想办法为病儿解除痛苦；自己又是个共产党员，应该带头克服困难，到喂饭时就把别的工作先放下，亲自喂她饭。不管费多长时间，也要使孩子吃饱、吃好。
    给烧伤病儿换药是个细致的工作，因为换药处理伤面都会给病儿带来较大的痛苦。有些病儿惧怕的心理十分严重，不让医护人员接近他。怎样才能解决这个矛盾，减轻病儿的痛苦呢？我就积极地创造条件。一方面严格要求自己在换药时尽量作到手轻心细，动作轻柔；另一方面，要消除孩子的惧怕心理，平时多接近他们，在换药时想方设法转移病儿的注意力，减少他们的痛苦。换药时，和病儿谈家常，教唱歌，或让他们做些有趣的事情，使他们精力分散，减轻了疼痛，很快就把药换完了。
    为了防止交叉感染，病房里是不允许家长陪住和探视的。因此，家长询问病情的很多，有时一个家长在一天内就要询问三四次。工作一忙，我们就常常流露出急躁情绪，解答问题就不够细致。我想，这能算是全心全意为人民服务吗？我带着这个问题，以毛主席的教导为武器，以商业战线上“百拿不厌，百问不烦”的精神为样板，对照检查了自己，觉得过去自己对待家长的态度，没有做到“完全”“彻底”。片面地认为我们是为病儿服务的，只要照顾好孩子就行了，不了解为家长服务和为病儿服务是一致的。后来，再有家长询问病情时，我就事先作好准备，耐心、详细地把病情、治疗情况和效果，以及孩子的情绪、爱好、表现等，都一一向家长交代清楚，并且给予必要的安慰，这就受到病儿家长来信赞扬。家长的每封来信，都激励我们更好地改进工作，更好地为病儿服务，为家长服务。
    心红才能技精
    刚成立烧伤病房时，我们在护理工作中遇到很多问题不能解决。病儿长期躺在床上不能翻身，常常因身体重量压迫伤面，增加痛苦，而且很容易发生褥疮；有些下身烧伤的病儿还容易被大小便污染，造成细菌感染，危及生命。最初，我单凭一股子热情去干，看到敷料脏了就换，一天不知道换多少次药，不仅孩子痛苦，工作也非常被动。这一切都告诉我，仅仅想做好工作，没有一套为人民服务的硬本领是不行的。起先，我们看到伤面受压或大小便弄脏伤面时，就用尿布折起来放在腰部或腿部，并且放上弯盘，收集大小便，防止压迫或污染伤面。
    有一次我腰痛，睡觉时在腰下边放了个暖水袋垫着，觉得很不舒服，这使我联想到：孩子的腰部垫几块尿布，也一定不好受。孩子的痛苦就是我的痛苦。于是，在护理时我就注意孩子怎样躺着才舒服，才不会压迫伤面，而且还能收集大小便。经过临床实践，从成功和失败中总结了经验教训，最后我和同志们总结出十种能够适用于各种烧伤部位的卧位。并根据“十大卧位”设计了男女病儿收集大小便的方法。这不仅减轻了病儿痛苦，也减少了污染机会，而且能够收集准确的尿量，供给医生作为观察和抢救休克的根据，提高了医疗护理质量。
    烧伤病儿最怕绿脓感染，特别是绿脓败血症。因此，早期预防和早期治疗绿脓感染，就成为烧伤病房的一项重要任务。怎样认识绿脓呢？我们遵照毛主席的教导，进行深入的调查研究，从实践中认识事物的本质，找出规律。有的病儿出现绿脓感染时，我们就密切观察，注意他们和一般病儿表现的微小区别，从全身情况到伤面，从气味到颜色，都仔细研究，终于做到了能早期识别绿脓感染的病儿了。每当发现敷料变成蓝绿色，伤面发出一种特殊的气味，就不等细菌培养结果，立刻给以隔离，及时配合医生采取治疗措施，减少绿脓的传播及绿脓败血症的发生。
    回国后的十几年中，自己只不过做了应该做的一点工作。今后我要时刻记住毛主席的话
  “虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，认真地学习毛主席著作，学习先进单位的经验，向本病房所有的同志学习，不断提高为人民服务的本领。
