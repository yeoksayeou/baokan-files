    Unite Against Imperialism, Defend Peace
    ——A Fond Farewell to Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Visit Abroad
    At the invitation of the heads of state of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries, our Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, has departed for Pakistan, embarking on a friendly visit to Asian neighbors. The entire Chinese people are filled with unparalleled excitement, warmly bidding farewell to Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit, and wishing the visit a complete success.
    China and Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries are friendly neighbors. Between China and many neighboring countries, there is not only a historical record of traditional friendship, but also, since the 1950s, a new chapter of friendship with extremely rich and vivid content has been written. China and many neighboring countries have continuously developed friendly cooperative relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. China and Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Nepal, and other countries, in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, have successfully resolved border issues left over from history, thus creating one peaceful and friendly international border after another on the Asian continent. Government and non-governmental representatives visit each other in an endless stream on the roads from China to many neighboring countries. Economic and cultural exchanges between China and many neighboring countries are also becoming more frequent. The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Asian countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan provide a good example of a new type of equal and friendly international relations.
    From the very first day of its birth, the People's Republic of China has unswervingly pursued a socialist foreign policy of peace and a policy of good neighborliness. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, explicitly declared, "The People's Republic of China has consistently sought to establish and develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to pursue a policy of good neighborliness towards all neighboring countries." The Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently adhered to the principles of this socialist foreign policy.
    China and the Asian and African countries share common interests, namely, opposing imperialism and all foreign aggression and interference, developing national economies, and carrying out peaceful construction. China and the Asian and African countries have every reason to support and assist each other in the common struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism. Therefore, all peace-loving Asian and African countries that pursue an independent foreign policy naturally establish equal and friendly relations with China. The peoples of Asian and African countries also naturally demand friendship with China. The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries cannot be destroyed by imperialism or any reactionary forces.
    Currently, imperialism, headed by the United States, is launching a frenzied offensive against the peoples of Asia and Africa. Imperialism has instigated a series of reactionary military coups in Africa, launching a counterattack against independent African countries and the African people, attempting to drag independent African countries back into colonial status. In Asia, US imperialism has sent more than 200,000 troops to launch an inhumane war of aggression against the South Vietnamese people, and has dispatched large numbers of aerial bandits to carry out indiscriminate bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. US imperialism is also stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. It is trying to turn Laos into an auxiliary battlefield for the invasion of Vietnam, and it is constantly provoking and infringing upon Cambodia through the puppet armies of Thailand and South Vietnam. Not long ago, US imperialism supported and encouraged Indian expansionists to launch an armed invasion of Pakistan, disrupting the peace of the subcontinent. At the same time, US imperialism is constantly plotting subversive conspiracies against Asian countries in order to re-control these countries. US imperialism is the most barbaric aggressor in the contemporary world and the most ferocious enemy of the Asian people and the people of the whole world.
    Faced with the offensive of imperialism headed by the United States, Asian and African countries need to further strengthen the cause of unity against imperialism, strengthen mutual support and cooperation, to thwart any counterattack by imperialism, promote the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African people, and safeguard the independence and sovereignty of Asian and African countries. Asian countries, due to their geographical proximity, are more closely linked in the struggle against interference, subversion, and aggression by imperialism and its lackeys, and must unite to fight the enemy together.
    The anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world is a whole. The anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian people is also a whole. The Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation is support and assistance to the people of the whole world, and first of all to the people of Asian countries. It is conceivable that if the South Vietnamese people had not bravely resisted the US aggressors, the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries would have been subjected to a more serious threat from US imperialism. The glorious victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation is also a victory for the Asian people and the people of the whole world. Similarly, the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination and the Pakistani people's struggle against aggression, and the Cambodian and Lao people's struggles against aggression and interference, are all positive contributions to Asian and world peace.
    Opposing aggression and safeguarding peace are inseparable. In order to defend Asian and world peace, it is necessary to resolutely oppose aggression and stop aggression. Chairman Mao Zedong explicitly declared: "The Chinese people regard the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victory and give warm sympathy and support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles." China's solemn position is unshakable under any circumstances. It is precisely from this principled position that the Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation, resolutely support the Lao and Cambodian people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and interference, resolutely support the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination, the Pakistani people's struggle against Indian aggressors, and all just struggles of the Asian people to safeguard independence and sovereignty.
    Now, Chairman Liu Shaoqi is going to bring the closest and most sincere friendship of the 650 million Chinese people once again to the people of neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. We firmly believe that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit will further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and its neighbors, enhance the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, and will make new and significant contributions to the cause of Asian and African unity against imperialism and to the cause of defending Asian and world peace.

    团结反帝  保卫和平
    ——欢送刘少奇主席出国访问
    我国刘少奇主席应巴基斯坦、阿富汗等国元首的邀请，已在陈毅副总理的陪同下，前往巴基斯坦，开始了对亚洲邻国的友好访问。全中国人民怀着无比的兴奋，热烈欢送刘少奇主席的出访，并预祝访问的圆满成功。
    中国和巴基斯坦、阿富汗等国，都是友好的邻邦。中国和许多邻国之间，不仅有着传统友谊的历史纪录，而且在二十世纪五十年代以后，又写下了内容极其丰富和生动的友谊的新篇章。中国和许多邻国之间，在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的基础上，不断地发展了友好合作关系。中国和巴基斯坦、阿富汗、缅甸、尼泊尔等国都本着互谅互让的精神，顺利地解决了历史遗留下来的边界问题，因而在亚洲大陆上出现了一条又一条和平友好的国际边界线。政府的和民间的代表相互访问，络绎不绝于中国通往许多毗邻国家的道路上。中国同许多邻国之间，经济和文化交流也日益频繁。中国和巴基斯坦、阿富汗等亚洲国家的友好合作关系，为平等友好的新型国际关系提供了良好的范例。
    中华人民共和国自从诞生的第一天起，就坚持不渝地奉行社会主义的和平外交政策和睦邻政策。中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席明确地宣布，“中华人民共和国一贯寻求在平等互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上建立和发展同一切国家的友好关系，并且对所有邻国执行睦邻政策。”中国政府和中国人民始终如一地遵循着这个社会主义对外政策的原则。
    中国同亚非国家，有着共同的利益，那就是反对帝国主义和一切外来的侵略和干涉，发展民族经济，进行和平建设。中国和亚非国家有一切理由在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，进行相互支持和相互援助。因此，一切爱好和平、奉行独立自主政策的亚非国家，都很自然地同中国建立平等友好的关系。亚非各国人民也很自然地要求同中国友好。中国人民和亚非各国人民之间的友谊，是帝国主义和任何反动势力也破坏不了的。
    目前，以美国为首的帝国主义正在对亚非人民进行猖狂的进攻。帝国主义在非洲策动了一系列反动军事政变，对非洲独立国家和非洲人民进行反扑，妄图把非洲独立国家重新拉回到殖民地地位上去。在亚洲，美帝国主义派出了二十多万军队，对南越人民发动了一场灭绝人性的侵略战争，并且出动大批空中强盗对越南民主共和国进行狂轰滥炸。美帝国主义还正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争。它力图把老挝变成侵略越南的辅助战场，它又通过泰国和南越的傀儡军队不断地向柬埔寨进行挑衅和侵犯。不久以前，美帝国主义支持和怂恿印度扩张主义者对巴基斯坦发动了武装侵略，破坏了次大陆的和平。同时，美帝国主义还不断地策划对亚洲国家的颠覆阴谋，以达到重新控制这些国家的目的。美帝国主义是当代世界最野蛮的侵略者，是亚洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    面临着以美国为首的帝国主义的进攻，亚非国家需要进一步加强团结反帝事业，加强相互支持和合作，来挫败帝国主义的任何反扑，促进亚非人民的反帝斗争，维护亚非国家的独立和主权。亚洲国家由于地理上的接近，它们在反对帝国主义及其走狗的干涉、颠覆和侵略的斗争中，更是休戚相关，更要团结起来，共同对敌。
    全世界人民的反帝斗争，是一个整体。亚洲人民的反帝斗争，也是一个整体。越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是对全世界人民的支持和援助，首先是对亚洲各国人民的支持和援助。可以设想，如果没有南越人民英勇抗击美国侵略者，那末，亚洲各国的独立和主权势将受到美帝国主义的更严重的威胁。越南人民抗美救国斗争的光辉胜利，也是亚洲人民和全世界人民的胜利。同样，克什米尔人民要求自决的斗争和巴基斯坦人民的反侵略斗争，柬埔寨人民和老挝人民的反侵略、反干涉的斗争，也都是对亚洲和世界和平的积极贡献。
    反对侵略和维护和平，是不可分割的。为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，就必须坚决反对侵略和制止侵略。毛泽东主席明确地宣布过：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”中国的这一严正立场在任何情况下都是不可动摇的。正是从这个原则立场出发，中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持老挝、柬埔寨人民的反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决、巴基斯坦人民抗击印度侵略者的斗争和亚洲各国人民维护独立、主权的一切正义斗争。
    现在，刘少奇主席将要把六亿五千万中国人民最亲密、最真诚的友谊，再一次带给巴基斯坦、阿富汗等邻国的人民。我们深信，刘少奇主席的出访，必将进一步加强中国和它的邻邦之间的友好合作关系，增进中国人民和亚洲各国人民的友谊，必将对亚非团结反帝的事业，对保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业作出新的重大的贡献。
