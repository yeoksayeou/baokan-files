    A certain artillery battalion of a regiment recently conducted live ammunition shooting practice. When announcing the results, the artillery battalion's Party committee highlighted politics, changing the past practice of evaluating performance based solely on the number of hits on the target. Instead, they emphasized commendations for units with clear training objectives, ideological leadership, and strong work styles, while criticizing the mindset of shooting solely for the sake of achieving good scores. Afterwards, the cadres said that the Party committee had done a good job in "guarding the gate," guiding them to never forget the fundamentals. The soldiers reflected that they had attended the most vivid and practical lesson on highlighting politics.
    The *Liberation Army Daily* published a short commentary stating: In the company-level units, announcing results and conducting reviews and individual talks are common and routine tasks. The Party committee of a certain artillery battalion grasped the problem in this seemingly ordinary matter, guarded the gate of highlighting politics, raised the ideological understanding of the cadres, and also educated the masses.
    Guarding the gate of highlighting politics means using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and handle all problems; it means establishing the thought of serving the revolution and the people wholeheartedly in all work. The guiding ideology, methods, and results differ greatly when handling any matter or doing any work. Take announcing shooting results, for example: Should we simply announce the superficial shooting figures, rank them in order, or should we, according to actual combat requirements, focus on publicizing the good ideology and good work style that led to the achievements? These two different approaches are guided by two different ideologies, and therefore will produce two different results. The former approach will lead people to focus on the "holes" on the target, compete for personal honor, and encourage the idea of valuing technology over politics. The latter approach will educate people to view achievements from a political and ideological perspective, and to establish the idea of shooting for the revolution. The Party committee of the artillery battalion adopted the latter approach, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve practical problems, and guarded the gate that even announcing shooting results must highlight politics.
    Whether or not to highlight politics: we must guard the gate on major events and important tasks, and we must also guard the gate on minor events and daily affairs. We must ensure that everyone, at all times, and in all places, focuses on political ideology and consciously highlights politics.

    处处把好突出政治的关
    某团炮营不久前进行了一次实弹射击。宣布成绩的时候，炮营党委突出政治，改变了过去就靶上眼数评成绩的作法，着重表扬了训练目的明确、思想领先、作风过硬的好单位，批评了单纯为成绩而打靶的思想。事后，干部们说，党委这一关把得好，引导我们时时不忘根本。战士们反映，上了一堂最生动最实际的突出政治课。
    《解放军报》发表短评说：在连队里，公布成绩和进行讲评、个别谈话一样，本来是经常要做、司空见惯的事。某团炮营党委在这个习以为常的事情上抓住了问题，把好了突出政治的关口，提高了干部的思想认识，也教育了群众。
    把好突出政治的关口，就是用毛泽东思想来观察、处理一切问题；就是在一切工作中树立一心为革命、一心为人民的思想。办任何事情，作任何工作，指导思想不同，作法不同，结果大不一样。就拿宣布射击成绩来说，是单纯公布射击表面数字，排个先后次序，还是按照实战要求，着重宣扬取得成绩的好思想、好作风？这两种不同的作法，是两种不同的思想作指导的，因此也就会出现两种不同的结果。前一种作法，会引导人们着重看靶上“窟窿”，争个人荣誉，助长重技术、轻政治的思想。后一种作法，会教育人们从政治思想上看成绩，树立为革命而打靶的思想。炮营党委采用了后一种作法，用毛泽东思想来回答和解决实际问题，把好了宣布射击成绩也要突出政治这一关口。
    是不是突出政治，大事情、重要任务要把关，小事情、日常事务也要把关。要做到人人、时时、处处都着眼于政治思想，自觉地突出政治。
