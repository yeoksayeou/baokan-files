    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th—William Epton, Vice Chairman of the Progressive Labor Party and a Black leader, who was unreasonably sentenced to one year in prison by the American judicial authorities, was released on bail on the 14th.

    Epton said after his release that he would never stop fighting. According to a report in the American weekly newspaper *Challenge* on the 22nd, Epton told the newspaper's reporter after his release: "Prisons have never been able to stop people from protesting and fighting for their circumstances. Although I am out of prison, it does not prove that politicians and courts have not been unjust to me and – more importantly – to my people. My struggle is only part of a larger struggle. This struggle will never stop unless we win."

    Epton was arrested by the authorities on July 25, 1964, for participating in the anti-violent struggle of Black people in Harlem, New York City, in the summer of 1964. On December 20 last year, the New York State Supreme Court used a "law" formulated in this state at the beginning of the century and not cited for decades, forcibly imposed on Epton the crime of "plotting to advocate criminal anarchism and conspiring to riot," and threw him into prison. This act of persecution by the American authorities has been condemned by the international and domestic progressive public in the United States.

    在国内外进步力量大力声援下保释出狱
    美国黑人领袖埃普顿表示决不停止斗争
    新华社二十七日讯  纽约消息：被美国司法当局无理判处一年徒刑的美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿十四日保释出狱。
    埃普顿出狱后表示将决不停止斗争。据美国《挑战》周报二十二日报道，埃普顿出狱以后对这家报纸的记者发表谈话说：“监狱从来没有能够制止人们为他们的境遇提出抗议和进行斗争。虽然我出狱了。但这并不能证明政客和法院不曾对我以及——更重要的——对我的人民作过不公正的事情。我的斗争只是整个斗争的一部分。除非我们取得胜利，否则这场斗争将决不停止。”
    埃普顿由于在一九六四年夏天参加纽约市哈莱姆区黑人的抗暴斗争，在同年七月二十五日被当局逮捕。去年十二月二十日，纽约州最高法院利用这个州在本世纪初制订而几十年来没有引用过的一条“法律”，给埃普顿强加上“图谋鼓吹犯罪性的无政府主义并且阴谋暴动”的罪名，把他投入了监狱。美国当局这种迫害行为，遭到了国际上和美国国内进步公众的谴责。
