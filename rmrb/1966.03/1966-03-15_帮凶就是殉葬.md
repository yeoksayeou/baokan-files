	Accomplices Are Just Being Buried Alive with the Dead
	By Our Staff Commentator

	The Australian government recently brazenly decided to send an additional three thousand troops to participate in the U.S. war of aggression in South Vietnam. Thus, the Australian ruling clique has further exposed its ugly face as a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism.

	The U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has lost all popular support. Moreover, with the American aggressors deeply mired in the quagmire and facing imminent disaster, many of the U.S.’s "allies" are unwilling to accompany them to their deaths. The Johnson administration spent a great deal of effort to barely pull in the South Korean puppet clique and a handful of accomplices such as Australia and New Zealand. The Holt government has in fact placed itself in the same position as the U.S. running dog Park Chung-hee clique. Holt and his ilk actually want to portray their actions of desperately following the U.S. aggression policy as being for "their own national security" and to achieve "stability" in Asia, which is truly shameful and laughable.

	The Australian government's decision to send more accomplice troops this time was a dirty deal made between the two sides not long ago when U.S. Vice President Humphrey went to Australia to collect cannon fodder. Humphrey agreed to purchase small arms and ammunition from Australia as an exchange condition for Australia increasing accomplice troops. The Holt government is taking the lives of Australian youths in exchange for the profits of arms dealers. The Canberra gentlemen are in fact acting as shameful headhunters.

	The Holt government's willingness to act as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is completely against the will of the Australian people. The Australian people have long launched a wave of struggle against the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, demanding the withdrawal of Australian accomplice troops. The Australian ruling authorities' decision to send more cannon fodder to Vietnam is a practice that is only hurting themselves. The wave of Australian people opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and the accomplice behavior of their own reactionaries will surely rise higher.

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 13th, sternly warning the Australian government and other U.S. vassal governments that they must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused in Vietnam due to their collusion with the United States. As the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, the U.S. aggressors are suffering a disastrous defeat in Vietnam and will inevitably suffer a complete defeat. No matter how many troops some of the U.S. vassals send to South Vietnam, they cannot help the U.S. aggressors reverse the situation, and they will surely suffer a tragic fate. In the end, accomplices can only become sacrifices buried with the dead.

    帮凶就是殉葬
    本报评论员
    澳大利亚政府最近悍然决定增派三千军队参加美国在南越进行的侵略战争。这样，澳大利亚统治集团就进一步暴露出它是美帝国主义忠实奴仆的丑恶面目。
    美帝国主义的侵越战争是失尽人心的，更加以美国侵略者深陷在泥潭里，面临着灭顶之灾，因而美国的许多“盟国”都不愿意奉陪。约翰逊政府费了九牛二虎之力才勉强拉到了南朝鲜傀儡集团和澳大利亚、新西兰等寥寥可数的几个帮凶。霍尔特政府事实上是把自己置于和美国走狗朴正熙集团同等的地位。霍尔特之流居然想把他们死命追随美国侵略政策的行径，说成是什么为了“自己的国家安全”和实现亚洲的“稳定”，实在可耻而又可笑。
    澳大利亚政府这次决定增派帮凶军，是不久以前美国副总统汉弗莱到澳大利亚搜罗炮灰的时候，双方做成的一笔肮脏的交易。汉弗莱同意了向澳大利亚购买小型武器弹药作为澳大利亚增加帮凶军的交换条件。霍尔特政府拿澳大利亚青年的生命去换取军火商的利润。堪培拉绅士们实际上充当了壮丁贩子的可耻角色。
    霍尔特政府甘心充当美帝国主义侵略越南的帮凶，是完全违背澳大利亚人民的意志的。澳大利亚人民早就掀起了反对美国侵越战争、要求撤回澳大利亚帮凶军的斗争浪潮。澳大利亚统治当局决定增派侵越炮灰的做法，正在国内激起了强烈的公愤。霍尔特政府实际上是搬起石头砸自己的脚。澳大利亚人民反对美帝国主义侵略和本国反动派帮凶行为的浪潮必将会更加高涨起来。
    越南民主共和国外交部十三日发表声明，严厉警告澳大利亚政府以及其它美国的仆从政府，它们必须对由于它们同美国勾结而在越南造成的严重后果承担全部责任。正如越南外交部的声明所指出的，美国侵略者正在越南遭到惨败，必将遭到彻底的失败。美国的一些仆从不论向越南南方增派多少军队，都不可能帮助美国侵略者扭转局势，而肯定将遭到悲惨的命运。帮凶者到头来只能成为殉葬品。
