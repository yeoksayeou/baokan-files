    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, March 27th – Accompanied by President Ayub Khan, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife visited the Taxila Museum, about twenty miles north of Rawalpindi, this morning.
    Taxila is a world-renowned historical site. It marks the magnificent Gandhara culture of the 5th century BC.
    In the museum, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife viewed the exquisite and beautiful sculptures, stone Buddhist statues, stupas, jewelry, pottery, and metalwork excavated from the ancient city of Taxila.
    President Ayub Khan personally introduced the unearthed cultural relics to Chairman Liu. He told Chairman Liu that the stone walls were excavated in Taxila and are very strong without cement or plaster.
    The long-standing friendly relations between China and Pakistan can also be seen from Taxila. The director of the Archaeological Bureau, who guided the tour, told the Chinese guests that the famous Chinese travelers, Faxian of the Jin Dynasty and Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty, visited Taxila in the 5th and 7th centuries respectively, when Taxila was a famous academic center in the subcontinent.
    In his travelogue "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," Xuanzang described the products and climate of Taxila as follows: "The land is fertile, and agriculture is prosperous. There are many springs and abundant fruits, and the climate is mild and pleasant."
    After the visit, Chairman Liu wrote in the guest book: "From the historical sites of Taxila, we see the glorious cultural tradition of the Pakistani people, and we also think of the long-standing friendly exchanges between the people of China and Pakistan. I wish the Pakistani people greater achievements in developing national culture. May the friendship between China and Pakistan last forever."
    On the lawn behind the museum, villagers dressed in brightly colored costumes performed the Hazara folk dance for the Chinese guests. President Ayub Khan presented the Chinese guests with oranges freshly picked from the fruit trees he personally planted in his orchard near Taxila. Officials from the Archaeological Bureau presented Chairman Liu and his wife with albums introducing the historical sites of Taxila and a sculpture, and Chairman Liu and his wife reciprocated with albums introducing ancient Chinese culture.
    Chairman Liu and other Chinese guests were warmly welcomed by thousands of villagers and citizens along the twenty-mile road from Rawalpindi to Taxila. As the motorcade passed, male students saluted, and turbaned old men and veiled women enthusiastically waved to the Chinese guests. Many people applauded warmly and shouted "Long live China!"

    在阿尤布·汗总统陪同下
    刘主席和夫人参观泰格西拉博物馆
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十七日电  刘少奇主席和夫人，在阿尤布·汗总统的陪同下，今天上午参观了拉瓦尔品第以北约二十英里的泰格西拉（城）的博物馆。
    泰格西拉是世界闻名的历史古迹。它标志着公元前五世纪的辉煌的甘达拉文化。
    刘少奇主席和夫人在博物馆里观看了从泰格西拉古城挖掘出来的精致美丽的雕塑品、石雕佛象、塔、珠宝、陶器和金属制品。
    阿尤布总统亲自向刘主席介绍了出土的文物。他对刘主席说，石墙是在泰格西拉出土的，它不用水泥或者灰泥，但是十分坚固。
    从泰格西拉也可以看到中国和巴基斯坦之间悠久的友好关系。引导参观的考古局局长对中国客人说，中国有名的旅行家、晋朝的法显和唐朝的玄奘先后在五世纪和七世纪访问过泰格西拉，当时泰格西拉是次大陆上一个著名的学术中心。
    玄奘在他的游记《大唐西域记》中，对泰格西拉的物产和气候作了这样的介绍：“地称沃壤，稼穑殷盛。泉流多，华果茂，气序和畅。”
    刘主席在参观后在留言簿上题词说：“从泰格西拉的古迹里，我们看到巴基斯坦人民的光辉文化传统，也联想到中巴两国人民之间悠久的友好来往。祝巴基斯坦人民在发展民族文化方面取得更大的成就。祝中巴友谊万古长青。”
    在博物馆后面的草场上，穿着色彩鲜艳的服装的村民们为中国客人表演了哈扎拉民族舞。阿尤布总统把他在泰格西拉附近的果园里亲手栽的果树上刚摘下来的桔子送给中国客人。考古局官员把介绍泰格西拉古迹的画册和一件雕塑品送给了刘主席和夫人，刘主席和夫人也把介绍古代中国文化的画册回赠他们。
    刘主席和其他中国客人在从拉瓦尔品第通往泰格西拉的长达二十英里的沿途，受到数以千计的村民和市民的热烈欢迎。当车队经过的时候，男学生们致敬礼，缠头的老人和戴面纱的妇女热情地向中国客人挥手致意。许多人热烈鼓掌，并且高呼“中国万岁！”
