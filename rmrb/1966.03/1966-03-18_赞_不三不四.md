    Praising "Neither Fish nor Fowl"
    Shanghai Qiwen Numbering Machine Factory　Zeng Caijin
    The multiple-cam rings of the eight engraving machines in our factory's type wheel workshop often broke down. Several mechanics were assigned to repair them, but the multiple-cam rings continued to break down frequently. Later, the factory assigned a young worker to repair them. After more than a year of diligent research, he discovered twelve patterns and data points related to the failure of the multiple-cam rings. From then on, not only did the multiple-cam rings break down less frequently, but also a batch of previously scrapped rings, after being ground and repaired by him, could be used for another three to five years. Now, when the factory's employees talk about this young worker's mechanical repair skills, everyone praises him unanimously.
    However, the emergence of any new thing, the start of any new technology, will not be smooth sailing; it will always encounter this or that difficulty and setback. A year ago, when that young worker first went to the workshop to repair the engraving machines, due to a lack of practical experience in repairing multiple-cam rings, he had to repair and explore simultaneously, operating the engraving machines, observing the damage to the multiple-cam rings. At that time, some people said that he was "neither fish nor fowl, neither like an engraving worker nor like a mechanic." According to these people, since he was a mechanic, he had to specialize in mechanical repairs, not touch this or fiddle with that; otherwise, he was "neither fish nor fowl." Little did they know that later, it was precisely because this young mechanic worked in a "neither fish nor fowl" manner that he finally discovered the patterns and data related to the failure of the multiple-cam rings, and solved the "long-standing difficult" problem.
    Currently, we are catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced levels in all aspects. To achieve this goal, we must have the original spirit of "tearing down the fences and jumping out of the old frameworks." As long as it is beneficial to the revolutionary work, beneficial to the production and construction, no matter whether the methods are "neither fish nor fowl" or "neither here nor there," we must do it. We praise the revolutionary spirit of "exploring on our own without experience" and "doing it ourselves without equipment" which is "neither fish nor fowl," and oppose the truly "neither fish nor fowl" conservative and superstitious thinking of the "formulaic" type and the "dare not surpass the predecessors by one step."

    赞“不三不四”
    上海启文速印机号码机厂　曾才金
    我厂字轮车间的八台雕刻机的倍令经常要坏，几个机修工都调去修过，可是倍令仍然经常要坏。后来厂部调了一位青工前去修理，经他一年多时间的刻苦钻研，共摸索出修理倍令的十二种规律和数据，从此，不仅倍令不容易坏了，并且连过去别人修理时所报废的一批倍令，经他磨修之后，也可再用上三、五年。现在厂里职工，谈起这位青工的机修技术，大家都一致称赞。
    然而，任何一个新事物的产生，任何一项新技术的开始，都不会一帆风顺，总是会遇到这种或那种困难和曲折的。一年前，那位青工刚去车间修理雕刻机时，由于缺乏修理倍令的实践经验，他只好一面修理，一面摸索，操作操作雕刻机，观察观察倍令的损坏情况。当时，有些人就说他“不三不四的，既不象雕刻工，又不象机修工。”按照这些人的看法，既然是机修工，就得专门机修，不得东摸摸，西弄弄，否则，就是“不三不四”。那晓得后来正因为这位青年机修工工作的“不三不四”，终于摸索出损坏倍令的规律和数据，解决了“老大难”问题。
    当前，我们正在各方面赶超世界先进水平。要达到这一目标，我们必须要有“拆掉墙篱笆，跳出老框框”的独创精神。只要对革命工作有利，对生产建设有利，不管所干的方式方法是“不三不四”，或者是“不五不六”，我们就是要干。我们赞扬那种“没有经验自己摸”；“没有设备自己搞”的“不三不四”的革命精神，反对那种“象样论”和“不敢超越前人一步”的真正不三不四的守旧迷信思想。
