	The scientific research and production departments affiliated with the Beijing Musical Instrument General Factory are trial-producing more than thirty kinds of musical instruments for farmers, including lightweight organs, simplified yangqins, large and small sanxians, pipas, banhus, and erhus. Three types are already in mass production.
	These musical instruments are trial-produced based on the needs of rural clubs and the opinions of amateur literary and artistic activists among the farmers. They generally have the characteristics of good sound quality, being lightweight and sturdy, low cost, economical, and practical, making them suitable for rural use. The lightweight organ designed and trial-produced by the Beijing Musical Instrument Research Institute has a loud sound and stable structure, with a cost about 30% lower than the lowest-priced organ currently on the market. At the same time, it is small in size, light in weight, and can be disassembled and folded, making it easy to carry, and suitable for use in rural primary schools, clubs, and mobile bands.

    适合农村需要的乐器
    北京乐器总厂所属科学研究和生产部门正在为农民试制轻便风琴、简易洋琴、大小三弦、琵琶、板胡、二胡等三十多种乐器，现在已有三种大批生产。
    这些乐器是根据农村俱乐部的需要和农民业余文艺活动分子的意见试制的。一般都具有音响效果良好、轻便坚固、成本低廉、经济实用等特点，适合农村使用。北京乐器研究所设计试制的轻便风琴，发音宏亮，结构稳定，成本比目前市场上价格最低的风琴还便宜百分之三十左右。同时，它的体积小，重量轻，可以拆卸折迭，便于携带，适合农村小学、俱乐部和流动乐队使用。
