    Ghanaian Coup Authorities Restore Diplomatic Relations with Britain
    British Government Immediately Issues Statement of Welcome
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 6th—The “National Liberation Council” of the Ghanaian military coup authorities issued a statement on the 5th, announcing the "decision to immediately restore diplomatic relations with the British government."
    That evening, the British government immediately issued a statement saying: British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, "welcomes" this decision by the Ghanaian coup authorities.
    One day before this decision was announced, the British government announced its recognition of the Ghanaian military coup authorities as the "Government of Ghana."
    Last December, the Ghanaian government severed diplomatic relations with Britain in protest against the British government's sheltering of the white colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia's criminal act of unilaterally declaring "independence."

    加纳政变当局恢复同英国外交关系
    英国政府立即发表声明表示欢迎
    新华社六日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳军事政变当局的“全国解放委员会”五日发表声明，宣布“决定立即同英国政府恢复外交关系”。
    当天晚上，英国政府立即发表声明说：英国联邦关系大臣阿瑟·博顿利“欢迎”加纳政变当局的这一决定。
    在这个决定宣布的前一天，英国政府宣布承认加纳军事政变当局为“加纳政府”。
    去年十二月，加纳政府由于抗议英国政府庇护南罗得西亚白人殖民政权片面宣布“独立”的罪恶行动，断绝了同英国的外交关系。
