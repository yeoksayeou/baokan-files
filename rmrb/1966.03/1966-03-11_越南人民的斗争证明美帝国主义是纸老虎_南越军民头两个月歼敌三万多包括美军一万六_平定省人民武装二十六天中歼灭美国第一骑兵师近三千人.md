    Hanoi, March 10th (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency reported that the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces issued a communique on the 7th stating that, according to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnamese army and people annihilated more than 32,000 enemy troops in January and February this year, including more than 16,000 U.S. aggressor troops and 3,500 South Korean mercenary troops.

    Among the annihilated enemy troops, seven battalions and thirty companies were completely wiped out, including four battalions and three companies of U.S. aggressor troops, and two companies of South Korean mercenary troops.

    During this period, the South Vietnamese army and people also shot down and destroyed more than 500 enemy aircraft of various types, damaged many others, and destroyed nearly 300 enemy military vehicles, including more than 120 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and tanks; and sank 20 enemy military ships and vessels.

    In addition, the South Vietnamese army and people also uprooted 35 enemy strongholds and pillboxes, forcing the enemy to abandon two military sub-districts and seven strongholds.

    The communique stated that in the first two months of this year, the U.S. aggressors frantically launched more than 20 large-scale "sweeps," each involving 10 to 20 battalions, and implemented extremely barbaric fascist policies of "burn all, kill all, destroy all" during these "sweeps." However, under the resolute blows of the South Vietnamese army and people, all these "sweeps" by the U.S. aggressors suffered heavy defeats. The more large-scale "sweeps" the U.S. aggressors and their mercenary troops launched, the more severe punishment they received from the South Vietnamese army and people.

    The communique stated that in these two months, the South Vietnamese army and people continued to maintain the initiative on all battlefields. They not only attacked and annihilated the enemy when they launched "sweeps," but also actively launched many large-scale offensives against the enemy, wiping out large numbers of enemy troops, many times annihilating entire battalions and companies. In many areas, the army and people not only attacked enemy camps and land and water transportation lines, but also continuously attacked provincial capitals and towns in enemy-occupied areas, severely punishing the enemy in their "safe rear."

    The communique stated that the Southern people's guerrilla warfare continued to develop widely and had achieved brilliant results. Guerrilla units in various places continue to tighten the encirclement of the U.S. aggressors, and many combat villages and combat townships continue to develop and consolidate. According to incomplete statistics, in these two months, guerrilla units in various parts of the South actively cooperated with the main forces and local forces to annihilate the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 10,000 enemy troops; shooting down and damaging 120 enemy aircraft of various types; and destroying 60 various military vehicles.

    The communique pointed out that in these two months, although U.S. imperialism launched many large-scale "sweeps" in an attempt to seize the initiative, the result was even heavier defeats. The facts of the past two months prove that the more U.S. aggressors reinforce South Vietnam, the more they are annihilated, and the more they are unable to save their complete defeat.

    The communique called on the South Vietnamese army and people to continue to carry forward the spirit of heroic combat, further develop the movement to "find Americans to annihilate, find puppet troops to fight," and strive for greater and more victories.

    Hanoi, March 10th (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency reported that the Liberation Armed Forces of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam severely attacked the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, which was conducting a large-scale "sweep." According to incomplete statistics, the army and people of Binh Dinh Province annihilated nearly 3,000 U.S. aggressor troops in the 26 days from January 27th to February 21st.

    During this period, in just seven days from February 15th to 21st, the army and people of Binh Dinh Province annihilated more than 1,440 U.S. aggressor troops, shot down and damaged four U.S. helicopters, and seized a large number of weapons and ammunition.

    On February 15th, a battalion of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, had just broken into Phu Huu Village, An Nhon Township, Hoai An County, when it was fiercely intercepted by the Liberation Armed Forces, and more than 200 were killed or wounded. That night, the Liberation Armed Forces took advantage of the enemy's shock and attacked the U.S. military base in Tan Thanh Village, An Nhon Township, eliminating 45 enemies. In the early morning of February 17th, the Liberation Army launched a surprise attack on two companies of U.S. aggressor troops stationed in Loc Giang Village, An Nhon Township, killing the enemy with grenades and bayonets, so that these two companies of U.S. troops were completely wiped out in an instant, killing and wounding 242. On the same day, the Liberation Army launched an attack on a company of U.S. troops in Phu Ninh Village, An Nghia Township. The U.S. bandits hurriedly dispatched two battalions of U.S. troops to rescue them, but they were ambushed by the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army soldiers fought close combat and bayonet combat with enemies several times larger than themselves, repelling the enemy's counterattacks dozens of times, and annihilating 380 enemies. On February 18th, the Liberation Armed Forces continued to intercept U.S. troops in the Phu Ninh and Da Mong areas of Hoai An County, eliminating 220 enemies. On the 20th, Liberation Army soldiers quickly launched a charge when the enemy's helicopters had just landed in Phu Ninh Village, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the U.S. aggressor troops, killing the U.S. troops howling and screaming, and annihilating 160 enemies on the spot. On February 21st, the Liberation Army eliminated 200 enemy troops in An Quy Township, Hoai Nhon County.

    In this way, adding the annihilated puppet troops and South Korean mercenary troops, from January 27th to February 21st, the army and people of Binh Dinh Province eliminated more than 5,000 enemies.

    Hanoi, March 10th (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency reported that guerrillas and local troops in Binh Khe County, Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, severely attacked the invading South Korean mercenary troops in three days from February 26th to 28th, eliminating 351 enemy troops.

    On February 26th, the U.S. puppet clique dispatched five battalions of South Korean mercenary troops to "sweep" through Ping An, Ping Hoa, and Ping Thuan townships in Binh Khe County, Binh Dinh Province. Wherever they went, they killed, burned, robbed, and raped women, committing all kinds of evils. The guerrillas and local troops in Binh Khe County were determined to severely attack the invading enemy and protect the lives and property of the people. They continuously tracked and fiercely intercepted the enemy for three consecutive days, eliminating a total of 351 enemy troops and shooting down two helicopters. These mercenary troops were beaten to a pulp by the guerrillas and fled back to Binh Khe County town in a panic on the 28th.

    Xinhua, March 10th – Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the U.S. puppet special forces camp 97 kilometers northwest of Da Nang in the early morning of the 9th and 10th, giving full play to the superiority of close combat, and wiping out all the enemy troops in this camp, more than 400, including 12 U.S. military "advisers," and leveled this lair.

    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Armed Forces began to attack this isolated stronghold of the enemy near the Vietnam-Laos border on the morning of the 9th, killing and wounding some enemies and shooting down an aircraft.

    On the night of the 9th, the Liberation Armed Forces surrounded the camp. After all preparations were completed, they broke into the enemy camp under fierce fire cover in the early morning of the 10th and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, wiping out all the enemy troops. United Press International reported: "Communist troops moved to within 100 meters of the barbed wire and trenches around the camp and began digging works shortly after midnight. The garrison in the camp could clearly hear the Communist troops digging trenches and foxholes outside the camp in preparation for a full-scale attack. The attack began at about 3:30 a.m. Within an hour, communist automatic weapons, mortars and small arms rained down a storm of fire. They stormed into the camp." Agence France-Presse reported that communications with the camp were cut off at 4:25 a.m. Associated Press reported: "The camp is a sheet of flames" and "Everything is on fire."

    Reuters reported: "A radio operator said he believed he was the only survivor of the camp's 400-plus garrison."

    Hanoi, March 10th (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency reported that the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam, Dak Lak, Quang Ngai, Lam Dong, Tra Vinh, and Thu Dau Mot provinces in South Vietnam have recently launched attacks, eliminating entire companies and platoons of enemy troops.

    On the night of February 21st, the army and people in the northern part of Quang Nam Province fiercely attacked an enemy stronghold on the Vinh Dien-Ai Nghia highway, completely wiping out a security company in this stronghold and seizing all weapons. The next morning, the enemy dispatched twelve armored vehicles to rescue them, but they were fiercely intercepted by the local army and people, and 100 were killed. On this day, the Liberation Armed Forces also bravely attacked the artillery positions of the U.S. Marine Corps south of Da Nang and the U.S. military dormitory. According to preliminary reports, the Liberation Armed Forces killed more than 20 U.S. aggressor troops and destroyed two 105mm howitzers.

    The army and people in the southern part of Dak Lak Province attacked the enemy stronghold in Sui Duc on the night of February 21st, completely wiping out the enemy's 901st Security Company and seizing many weapons.

    越南人民的斗争证明美帝国主义是纸老虎
    南越军民头两个月歼敌三万多包括美军一万六
    平定省人民武装二十六天中歼灭美国第一骑兵师近三千人
    新华社河内十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量指挥部七日发表公报说，据不完全统计，越南南方军民在今年一月份和二月份两个月里共歼灭敌人三万二千多名，其中包括美国侵略军一万六千多名和南朝鲜帮凶军三千五百名。
    在被歼灭的敌军中，有七个营和三十个连被全歼，其中包括美国侵略军四个营、三个连和南朝鲜帮凶军两个连。
    在这期间，南方军民还击落和摧毁敌军各种类型飞机五百多架，击伤许多架，击毁敌人各种军用车辆近三百辆，其中包括M—113型两栖装甲车和坦克一百二十多辆；击沉敌人军用船只和舰艇二十艘。
    此外，南方军民还拔除敌人据点和岗楼三十五个。迫使敌人放弃两个军事支区和七个据点。
    公报说，在今年头两个月里，美国侵略者疯狂地发动了二十多次大规模“扫荡”，每次出动十到二十多个营，并且在
  “扫荡”中实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”的极其野蛮的法西斯政策。但是，在越南南方军民的坚决打击下，美国侵略者的所有这些“扫荡”全都遭到惨重的失败。美国侵略者及其帮凶军越是发动大规模的“扫荡”，就越遭到越南南方军民更严厉的惩罚。
    公报说，在这两个月里，越南南方军民在各个战场上都继续掌握着主动权。他们不仅在敌人出动“扫荡”的时候袭击和歼灭敌人，而且还主动向敌人发动多次大规模的进攻，歼灭敌人大批有生力量，其中许多次是整营整连地歼灭敌军。许多地区的军民不仅袭击敌人的营地和水陆交通线，并且还不断进攻敌占区的省会、市镇，在敌人的“安全后方”，严惩敌人。
    公报说，南方人民游击战争继续得到广泛的发展，并且已经取得了辉煌的战绩。各地游击队不断紧缩对美国侵略者的包围圈，许多战斗村和战斗乡不断得到发展和巩固。据不完全的统计，在这两个月里，南方各地游击队积极配合主力部队和地方部队歼灭敌人，共打死打伤和俘虏敌军近一万名；击落击伤各种类型敌机一百二十架；击毁各种军车六十辆。
    公报指出，在这两个月里，尽管美帝国主义发动了多次大规模“扫荡”，妄图取得主动权，但结果却遭到了更沉重的失败。两个月来的事实证明，美国侵略者向越南南方增兵越多，被歼灭的也就越多，就更加无法挽救它们的彻底失败。
    公报号召越南南方军民继续发扬英勇战斗的精神，进一步开展“找美国佬歼，找伪军打”的杀敌运动，争取更大更多的胜利。
    新华社河内十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省解放武装力量痛打进行大规模“扫荡”的美国第一骑兵师，据不完全统计，从一月二十七日到二月二十一日的二十六天中，平定省军民共歼灭美国侵略军近三千名。
    在这个期间，仅仅从二月十五日到二十一日的七天内，平定省军民就歼灭美国侵略军一千四百四十多名，击落击伤美国直升飞机四架，缴获大批武器和弹药。
    二月十五日，美国第一骑兵师的一个营，在飞机、大炮的掩护下，刚刚闯进怀恩县恩祥乡富友村，就遭到解放武装力量的猛烈阻击，被打死打伤两百多名。当天晚上，解放武装力量趁敌人惊魂未定又袭击了恩祥乡新清村的美军驻地，歼敌四十五名。二月十七日凌晨，解放军对驻扎在恩祥乡禄江村的两连美国侵略军发起突然袭击，用手榴弹和刺刀杀敌，使这两连美军在倾刻间就全军覆没，被打死打伤二百四十二名。当天，解放军又对安义乡富宁村的一连美军发动进攻，美国强盗慌忙派遣两营美军前往救援，但是遭到解放军的狙击。解放军战士同比自己多好几倍的敌人打近战、拼刺刀，打退了敌人成十次的反扑，歼灭敌人三百八十名。二月十八日，解放武装力量继续在怀恩县富宁、多蒙地区截击美军，歼敌二百二十名。二十日，解放军战士趁着敌人的直升飞机刚刚在富宁村着陆时，迅速发起冲锋，同美国侵略军展开白刃战，杀得美军狼嚎鬼叫，当场歼敌一百六十名。二十一日，解放军又在怀仁县安桂乡消灭敌军二百名。
    这样，加上被歼灭的伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军，从一月二十七日到二月二十一日，平定省军民共歼敌五千多名。
    新华社河内十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省平溪县游击队和地方部队，二月二十六日到二十八日三天内，痛歼进犯的南朝鲜帮凶军，消灭敌军三百五十一名。
    二月二十六日，美伪集团出动了五个营的南朝鲜帮凶军，对平定省平溪县的平安、平和、平顺等乡进行“扫荡”。他们每到一个地方就杀人、放火、抢劫、强奸妇女，无恶不作。平溪县游击队和地方部队决心痛击来犯的敌人，保卫人民的生命财产，他们连续三天跟踪猛烈阻击敌人，共歼敌三百五十一名，击落直升飞机两架。这些帮凶军被游击队打得焦头烂额，在二十八日慌忙逃回平溪县城。
    新华社十日讯  西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量九日和十日凌晨猛袭岘港西北九十七公里处的美伪特种部队营地，充分发挥近战的优越性，一举全歼这个营地的敌军四百多名，其中有美军“顾问”十二名，并夷平了这个巢穴。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量九日早晨开始对敌人这一个靠近越南—老挝边界的孤立据点发动进攻，杀伤了一些敌人，并打下飞机一架。
    九日夜晚，解放武装力量即把这个营地包围起来，在一切准备工作完成后，十日凌晨在猛烈的火力掩护下，突入敌营地，同敌人展开肉搏战，全歼敌军。合众国际社的报道说：
  “共产党部队运动到靠近这个营地周围的铁丝网和壕沟不到一百米的地方。并在子夜过后不久，就开始挖工事。营地的驻军可以清楚地听到共产党部队就在营地外为准备全面出击而挖掘壕沟和单人掩体的声音。约在凌晨三点半，攻击开始了。在一个小时内，共产党的自动武器、迫击炮和小型武器发出狂风暴雨般的火力。他们冲进了营地。”据法新社报道，到四点二十五分，外界同这个营地的电讯联络即告中断。美联社报道说：“营地是一片火焰”，
  “一切东西都着火了”。
    路透社报道说：“一个无线电报务员说，他相信他是这个营地四百多名驻军中唯一的幸存者。”
    新华社河内十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南、多乐、广义、林同、茶荣和土龙木等省解放武装力量，最近纷纷出击，歼灭整连和整排的敌军。

    多乐省南部军民，在二月二十一日夜间袭击绥德敌军据点，全歼敌军第九零一保安连，并且缴获许多武器。
    广义省解放武装力量于二月二十三日深夜至二十四日凌晨猛烈袭击山河县环所敌军据点，全歼敌“民卫队”一个连。
