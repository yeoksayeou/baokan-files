    The Drums of War Sound
    Daqing Oilfield　Wang Dacai
    The drums of war are beating, the drilling rigs rumble, and people cheer;
    The earth trembles, the ice melts for a thousand miles, heralding the arrival of spring.
    The drums of war sound again and again, and the new Five-Year Plan has begun;
    We tell each other: We must study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" well again.
    The drums of war stir up a fiery red tide, and everyone's heart is burning with passion;
    Eating wind and sleeping in the open, we will surely make the waves of oil run high.

    战鼓擂动
    大庆油田　王大才战鼓敲响了，钻机隆隆人欢笑；大地震动，千里冰消报春到。战鼓声声敲，新的五年计划开始了；奔走相告：再把“两论”学习好。战鼓激红浪，人人心中烈火烧；餐风宿露，定叫石油浪头高。
