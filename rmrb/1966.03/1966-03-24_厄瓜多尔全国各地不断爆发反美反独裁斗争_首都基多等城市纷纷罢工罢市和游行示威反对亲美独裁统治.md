    Xinhua News Agency, Quito, March 23rd: Approximately 5,000 workers and students in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, recently held large-scale demonstrations protesting the pro-American military dictatorship's raising of prices and pursuing economic policies that sell out national interests.
    The demonstrating masses marched through the city center, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Dictatorial Regime" and "Hang the Traitors." The reactionary authorities mobilized large numbers of soldiers and police to suppress the demonstrations, but the valiant demonstrators persisted in their struggle and continued to hold lightning rallies in the commercial districts and suburbs.
    Prior to the demonstrations, the workers and students held rallies. Representatives of many mass organizations spoke at the meetings, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's oppression and plunder of Ecuador, as well as the pro-American military dictatorship's treasonous policies. They unanimously demanded that the dictatorship revoke the concessions granted to American companies.
    The representative of the Coastal Agricultural Workers Union condemned at the meeting the dictatorship's adoption of policies that bowed to the interests of American monopoly capital. He said, "For the benefit of those American companies that plunder Ecuador's oil, aquatic products, bananas, forests, and various natural resources, the dictatorial regime does not hesitate to worsen the living conditions of the people."

    Xinhua News Agency, Quito, March 22nd: The Ecuadorian people continue to wage a heroic struggle against the dictatorial regime imposed by U.S. imperialism.
    Following the large-scale anti-American and anti-dictatorial demonstrations held by people across Ecuador in January and February, strikes, market shutdowns, and demonstrations have continuously erupted in Quito, the capital city, as well as in many important Ecuadorian cities and regions such as Cuenca, Loja, Manabi, Tulcan, Duran, and Alausi.
    On March 18th, women in the capital, Quito, held an anti-dictatorial demonstration in Independence Square, despite attacks by police with tear gas. They shouted slogans such as "We want a constitution, we want the people, no more military boots." On the same day, the people of Alausi, a town in the province of Chimborazo, also held demonstrations and a market shutdown to protest high prices, and the police opened fire to suppress them.
    On February 25th, large-scale demonstrations also broke out in Quito, Cuenca, Loja, Manabi, and other cities. This large-scale demonstration, which affected many parts of the country, forced the dictatorial government to temporarily cancel its decision to raise prices.
    Students in Tulcan, the capital of Carchi province, held a demonstration on the 12th to oppose the U.S. imperialist-backed dictatorial regime.
    The demonstrating students shouted slogans such as "Down with the Dictatorship" and used stones to attack the vehicles carrying members of the Ecuadorian military junta and the provincial government office building. The dictatorial authorities dispatched soldiers and police to suppress the demonstrations. Paratroopers fired shots to threaten the demonstrators. The police used tear gas. One student was injured. Disregarding the suppression by soldiers and police, the demonstrators continued to march in groups to protest and persisted in their struggle until the evening.
    On February 14th, workers at the "Pepsi-Cola" beverage company in Guayaquil, which is operated by American capital, went on strike and occupied the factory building, demanding that the American factory owner fulfill his promise to increase wages.
    Automobile drivers in Tulcan also went on strike, protesting the Ecuadorian dictators' arrival in this northeastern border city of Ecuador. (Attached photo)
