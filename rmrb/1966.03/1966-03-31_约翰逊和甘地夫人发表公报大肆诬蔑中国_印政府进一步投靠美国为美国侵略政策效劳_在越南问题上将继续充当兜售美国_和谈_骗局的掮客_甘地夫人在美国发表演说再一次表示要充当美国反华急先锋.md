    Johnson and Mrs. Gandhi Issue Communiqué, Viciously Slandering China
    Indian Government Further Kowtows to the U.S., Serving U.S. Aggression Policy
    Will Continue to Act as Brokers Peddling the U.S. "Peace Talks" Deception on the Vietnam Issue
    Mrs. Gandhi Delivers Speech in the U.S., Once Again Expressing Her Intention to Act as an Anti-China Vanguard for the U.S.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 30th: Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi concluded her two-day talks with U.S. President Johnson on the 29th. The outcome of the talks demonstrates that, in order to beg for more dollars, the Indian government is further selling itself to the United States, serving the U.S. policy of aggression and war in Asia.
    The communiqué issued after the talks indicates that they discussed the issue of the U.S. giving India more "aid," Sino-Indian relations, Indo-Pakistani relations, and the Vietnam issue. The communiqué stated that the talks were "frank and friendly," and that "the President and Prime Minister believe that this visit once again affirmed the strong friendly ties between the United States and India." Mrs. Gandhi also said obsequiously on the 28th that each of her visits to the United States was an opportunity for "education." She also said on the 29th that "India is as important to the United States as the United States is to India."
    The communiqué shows that the U.S. and India want to unite against China. The communiqué distorts the truth by describing India's aggression against China as China pursuing a policy of "aggression" against India, and claiming that "this policy of aggression constitutes a threat to peace, especially peace in Asia." In order to display her identity as an anti-China vanguard for the U.S., Mrs. Gandhi also slandered China once again in a speech at the U.S. National Press Club on the 29th, falsely accusing China of adopting a "threatening posture" towards India and slandering China as not wanting peace in the Indian subcontinent, being interested in "as much turmoil and instability as possible" there. In order to take off India's "non-aligned" cloak and cover up the ugly act of selling itself to the United States, Mrs. Gandhi also said that "Beijing is trying to undermine India's policy of non-alignment."
    The communiqué also shows that, on the Vietnam issue, India will further act as a broker peddling the U.S. "peace talks" deception. The communiqué stated that in this regard, the President explained the "policy pursued" by the United States. The Prime Minister explained her country's continued expression of concern and efforts to achieve a just and peaceful resolution of this issue." Mrs. Gandhi later blatantly said to reporters that India is the chairman of the International Supervisory Commission, and "we continue to play a constructive role in the work of seeking peace in Vietnam." She also advocated reconvening the fourteen-nation Geneva Conference as a venue for peddling the U.S. "peace talks" deception.
    Regarding Indo-Pakistani relations, the communiqué pretentiously stated that it would further "restore the peaceful situation in the (Indian) subcontinent," but Mrs. Gandhi made it clear when answering reporters' questions that the so-called "peace" in the Indian subcontinent in India's mind is for Pakistan to abandon its struggle against Indian aggression and allow India to occupy Kashmir.
    Regarding the issue of India begging for "U.S. aid," the communiqué stated that Johnson assured Mrs. Gandhi that the U.S. government is "deeply interested in participating in international efforts, especially the efforts made under the leadership of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to help India..." "The President and Prime Minister discussed India's urgent food requirements due to last year's unprecedented drought." "The President assured her that, with the consent of Congress, the United States will continue to participate generously in international efforts to alleviate India's current food shortage. The President told Mrs. Gandhi that he intends to submit a special message to Congress soon, asking Congress to approve this U.S. aid."
    The communiqué also stated that Mrs. Gandhi welcomed Johnson's proposal to establish an "Indo-U.S. Foundation." According to Western news agencies, in order to strengthen U.S. cultural infiltration in India, Johnson decided on the 28th to extract a considerable amount of 300 million U.S. dollars worth of Indian rupees from the proceeds of surplus wheat sold by the United States to India to establish an "Indo-U.S. Foundation" to promote so-called "education and scientific" activities in India. After the talks, Mrs. Gandhi is preparing to go to New York on March 30th and will return to New Delhi via London on April 1st.

    约翰逊和甘地夫人发表公报大肆诬蔑中国
    印政府进一步投靠美国为美国侵略政策效劳
    在越南问题上将继续充当兜售美国“和谈”骗局的掮客
    甘地夫人在美国发表演说再一次表示要充当美国反华急先锋
    新华社三十日讯  华盛顿消息：印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人二十九日结束了同美国总统约翰逊为期两天的会谈。会谈的结果表明，为了乞求更多的美元，印度政府正在进一步卖身投靠美国，为美国在亚洲的侵略和战争政策效劳。
    会谈结束后发表的公报说明，他们在会谈中讨论了美国给予印度更多“援助”的问题、中印关系、印巴关系和越南问题等。公报说，会谈是“坦率和友好的”，“总统和总理认为，这次访问又一次肯定了美国和印度之间坚强的友好联系”。甘地夫人在二十八日还奴颜婢膝地说，她每一次访问美国都是一次“受教育”的机会。她在二十九日又说，“印度对美国来说同美国对印度来说一样重要。”
    公报表明美印两国要联合反华。公报颠倒是非地把印度对中国的侵略说成是中国对印度推行“侵略政策”，并且说什么“这种侵略政策构成了对和平，特别是亚洲和平的威胁”。为了显示自己作为美国反华急先锋的身份，甘地夫人二十九日在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演说时还再一次诬蔑中国对印度采取“威胁姿态”，并且诽谤中国不希望印度次大陆有和平，中国感兴趣的是那里“尽量发生动乱和不稳定”。为了替印度脱下了“不结盟”的外衣，卖身投靠美国的丑行遮羞，甘地夫人还说什么“北京试图破坏印度的不结盟政策”。
    公报还表明，在越南问题上，印度将要进一步充当兜售美国的“和谈”骗局的掮客。公报说，在这方面，总统解释了美国“奉行的政策。总理解释了她的国家为使这一问题得到公正和和平的解决而继续表示的关切和作出的努力。”甘地夫人后来对记者发表谈话时还露骨地说，印度是国际监督委员会的主席，“我们在越南继续谋求和平的工作中始终起建设性的作用”。她还鼓吹重新召开十四国日内瓦会议，作为兜售美国“和谈”骗局的场所。
    关于印巴关系，公报装腔作势地说要进一步“恢复（印度）次大陆的和平局势”，但是甘地夫人在回答记者的问题时表明，印度心目中的印度次大陆的所谓“和平”，就是要巴基斯坦放弃反对印度侵略的斗争，任由印度霸占克什米尔。
    关于印度乞讨“美援”的问题，公报说，约翰逊向甘地夫人保证，美国政府“深有兴趣，要参加国际的努力，特别是在国际复兴和开发银行的领导下作出的努力，来帮助印度……”。“总统和总理讨论了印度由于去年空前干旱而产生的紧急的粮食要求”，“总统向她保证，在国会同意的情况下，美国将继续慷慨地参加为缓和印度目前缺粮问题而作出的国际努力。总统对甘地夫人说，他打算很快向国会提出一个特别咨文，请国会批准美国的这种援助。”
    公报还说，甘地夫人欢迎约翰逊关于成立“印美基金会”的建议。据西方通讯社报道，为了加强美国对印度的文化渗透，约翰逊二十八日已决定从美国向印度抛售的剩余小麦所得到的款项中抽出相当三亿美元的印度卢比来成立一个“印美基金会”，来促进印度的所谓“教育和科学”活动。在会谈结束后，甘地夫人准备在三月三十日前往纽约，并将在四月一日取道伦敦返回新德里。
