    As long as there is breath, there must be a fight
    The Unyielding Spirit of Nguyen Van Thien, a Soldier of the Vietnamese People's Army
    Nguyen Van Thien, this is the name of a young anti-aircraft artillery gunner in a unit of the Vietnamese People's Army. This name has now become a symbol of revolutionary heroism for the military and civilians in North Vietnam. In the fierce battles to severely punish American air pirates, this young gunner made brilliant contributions to the great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation with his unparalleled heroic actions.
    In the fierce battle to defend the Ham Rong Bridge in Thanh Hoa Province, Nguyen Van Thien commanded an anti-aircraft gun. Once, in a fierce battle to severely punish American air pirates, he was seriously wounded in the abdomen, and his intestines were flowing out. However, this young man, only twenty-two years old, in order to ensure the victory of the battle, regardless of his personal safety, made up his mind to fight to the end. Enduring the severe pain, he used one hand to press his intestines back into his stomach, and the other hand continued to hold the flag firmly, directing the battle. Blood kept flowing from his wound, but he did not utter a word, as if nothing had happened, not letting his comrades know, and insisted on fighting, fighting alongside his comrades to shoot down American bandit planes. When the political instructor ordered him to be treated and bandaged, and sent him off the firing line, he suddenly stood up, unwilling to leave the position:
    "Report to the political instructor, I am very clear-headed, I can still fight!"
    In the military hospital, Nguyen Van Thien bravely and calmly endured the severe pain of eleven wounds on his abdomen, stomach, waist, hands, and feet. When the comrades in the military hospital wanted to cover his eyes before performing surgery on him in order to cut open his abdomen and reconnect his blood vessels, he pulled off the bandage and silently watched the doctor perform the surgery calmly. In the hospital bed, his heart was always burning with anger to defeat the enemy, and he repeatedly asked to return to the army and his fighting post as soon as possible.
    Now, this steel warrior of the Vietnamese People's Army has finally returned to the anti-aircraft artillery position and plunged into a new fierce battle.
    Nguyen Van Thien's heroism and courage vigorously encourage the military and civilians in North Vietnam to strike even harder at American air pirates. When publishing reports about Nguyen Van Thien's heroic fighting deeds, the Vietnamese *People's Daily* pointed out: Nguyen Van Thien is a representative of the heroic young generation of Vietnam. He highly developed the revolutionary courage of the People's Army soldiers, like Nguyen Viet Xuan, as long as there is breath, there must be a fight, unafraid of sacrifice and hardship, and resolutely eliminate the American invading bandits.

    只要还在呼吸就要战斗
    越南人民军战士阮文田的硬骨头精神
    阮文田，这是越南人民军高射炮部队某部一个青年炮长的名字。这个名字，现在已经成为越南北方军民革命英雄主义的象征。在痛歼美国空中强盗的激烈战斗中，这位青年炮长以无比英勇的行为，为抗美救国的伟大斗争作出了光辉的贡献。
    在保卫清化省咸龙桥的激烈战斗中，阮文田指挥着一门高射炮。一次，他在痛歼美国空中强盗的激战中，腹部负了重伤，肠子也流出来了。但是，这个年仅二十二岁的青年，为了保证战斗的胜利，不顾个人的安危，下定决心，坚决战斗到底。他忍受着剧烈的创痛，用一只手把肠子压回肚里，另一只手继续牢牢地拿着旗子，指挥战斗。鲜血从他的伤口不住地流淌，但是，他却一声不哼，若无其事地不让战友们知道，并且一直坚持战斗，与战友们一起打下了美国强盗飞机。当政治指导员下令要给他治疗和包扎，并把他送下火线时，他却猛然站起来，不愿离开阵地：
    “报告政治指导员，我清醒得很，我仍然能够战斗！”
    在军医院里，阮文田勇敢、平静地忍受着腹部、胃部、腰部和手脚上十一处伤口的剧痛。当军医院的同志们要蒙上他的眼睛给他动手术，以便剖开他的腹部给他接复血脉时，他却拉下了绷带，一声不哼，泰然地看着医生作手术。在病床上，他的心中也时刻燃烧着战胜敌人的怒火，一再要求早日回到部队，回到自己的战斗岗位上去。
    现在，这位越南人民军的钢铁战士，终于回到高射炮阵地上，投入新的激烈的战斗中去了。
    阮文田的英雄气概和勇敢精神，有力地鼓舞着越南北方军民更加沉重地打击美国空中强盗。越南《人民报》在发表有关阮文田的英勇战斗事迹时指出：阮文田是越南英雄的年青一代的代表，他高度发扬了人民军队战士的革命勇气，象阮曰春那样，只要还在呼吸就要战斗，不怕牺牲和艰苦，坚决消灭美国侵略强盗。
