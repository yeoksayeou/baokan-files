    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 15th -- The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published an editorial on March 15th entitled "The Anti-China Movement of Imperialism and Revisionism is Bound to Meet a Shameful Defeat." The editorial pointed out that at a time when U.S. imperialism is shifting the spearhead of its global strategic aggression towards Asia, and particularly towards the People's Republic of China, they, in collusion with modern revisionist leaders, have launched a frenzied anti-China movement, attempting to use deafening anti-China clamor to cover up the truth, stir up anti-communist hysteria, and slander the great Chinese people. Under the infamous slogan of "containing China," U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are plotting dangerous conspiracies, preparing to attack China, and preparing to intensify aggression and expand the war in Asia, using this anti-China clamor as cover for the war conspiracies currently being planned by the U.S. government.

    The article pointed out that Asia today is experiencing a surging revolutionary tide and anti-imperialist struggle. The people of Asian countries, as well as the people of African and Latin American countries, have risen up to fight because they have been subjected to U.S. aggression, interference, and U.S. oppression. As long as U.S. imperialism engages in aggression, as long as it still uses all means and all ways to suppress and enslave others, then the oppressed people and nations can only oppose U.S. imperialism with all means and ways.

    The article said that the great People's China enjoys enormous respect and prestige among the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other countries of the world, and has a very significant influence on the international stage, because China's revolutionary example has helped the people of these countries find the path to their own liberation.

    The article pointed out that People's China has made unremitting struggles to strengthen the anti-imperialist unity of the people of Asia and Africa and to safeguard peace and strengthen international security. People's China pursues a thorough revolutionary policy, vigorously exposing the common conspiracy of imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists to collude in establishing world hegemony.

    The article pointed out that it is precisely because China follows this correct position that China has been subjected to the frenzied hatred of U.S. imperialism, which today sees China as the main and biggest obstacle to its establishment of world hegemony. The article said that China's revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and peace-loving policy is a huge force that prevents U.S. imperialists from succeeding.

    The article said that Khrushchev revisionist leaders are playing a very despicable and shameful role in supporting the imperialist anti-China movement of "containing China." The Soviet revisionist leaders are doing everything possible to smear China's Marxist-Leninist and peace-loving foreign policy and undermine its prestige. Recently, their anti-China propaganda and anti-China activities have been completely coordinated with imperialism. They have taken a series of more vicious steps directly linked to the U.S. imperialist "firepower encirclement" of China. The Soviet leaders, who have long betrayed the interests of the people of all countries in the world, have become faithful supporters and accomplices of U.S. imperialism in realizing its policy of "containing China."

    The article then pointed out that these frenzied anti-China actions by U.S. imperialists and their supporters can only show their weakness and only show that they have suffered defeat and are unable to stop the development of revolutionary struggles. If U.S. imperialism, due to madness, completely loses its senses and dares to attack China, then it will meet its inevitable death there.

    阿报谴责苏联领导人充当美帝“遏制中国”的帮凶
    中国坚定地奉行彻底革命政策
    帝国主义和修正主义反华必败
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十五日发表一篇题为《帝国主义和修正主义的反华运动必将遭到可耻失败》的编辑部文章指出，在美帝国主义把全球战略的侵略矛头移向亚洲、特别是指向中华人民共和国的时候，他们伙同现代修正主义领导人掀起了一场疯狂的反华运动，企图用震耳欲聋的反华叫嚣来掩盖真理，掀起反共的歇斯底里，诽谤伟大的中国人民。美帝及其仆从在臭名远扬的“遏制中国”的口号下，正在策划危险的阴谋，准备进攻中国，并准备加紧侵略和扩大亚洲战争，用这种反华叫嚣为美国政府目前正在策划的战争阴谋打掩护。
    文章指出，亚洲今天存在着汹涌澎湃的革命高潮和反帝斗争。亚洲各国人民、以及非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民都是由于受到美国的侵略、干涉以及美国的压迫才起来进行斗争的。只要美帝国主义进行侵略，只要它还是用一切手段和一切方式来压制和奴役别人，那么被压迫人民和国家也就只有用一切手段和方式来反对美帝国主义。
    文章说，伟大的人民中国在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和世界其他国家人民中间享有巨大的尊敬和威望，在国际舞台上有着十分巨大的影响，这是因为中国的革命榜样帮助这些国家的人民找到了争取自己解放的道路。
    文章指出，人民中国为加强亚非各国人民的反帝团结、为维护和平与加强国际安全进行了不懈的斗争。人民中国奉行着彻底的革命政策，大力揭露了帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者互相勾结建立世界霸权的共同阴谋。
    文章指出，正是因为中国遵循这一正确立场，中国遭到了美帝国主义的疯狂仇恨，它今天把中国看成是它建立世界霸权的主要的和最大的障碍。文章说，中国的革命、反帝、爱好和平的政策是使美帝国主义者不能得逞的巨大力量。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导人在支持帝国主义“遏制中国”的反华运动中扮演着十分卑鄙和可耻角色。苏联修正主义领导人千方百计地给中国马克思列宁主义的，爱好和平的对外政策抹黑、破坏它的威信。最近，他们的反华宣传和反华活动已经同帝国主义完全协调一致。他们采取了一系列更加恶毒的、同美帝国主义对中国的“火力包围圈”直接相联的步骤。长期以来背叛了世界各国人民利益的苏联领导人已经成为美帝国主义实现“遏制中国”政策的忠实支持者和帮凶。
    文章接着指出，美帝国主义者及其支持者的这些疯狂的反华行动，只能表明他们的虚弱，只能表明他们遭受了失败，而又无法阻止革命斗争的发展。如果美帝国主义由于疯狂，完全丧失理智，胆敢进攻中国，那末，它将在那里遭到不可避免的死亡。
    文章说：人民中国一向出色地履行着她的光荣的国际主义义务。中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的共产党，高举着马列主义和无产阶级国际主义的胜利旗帜，站在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争最前线。在从意识形态上和政治上完全粉碎修正主义、捍卫马列主义纯洁性的斗争中，他们过去和现在都作出了具有重大世界历史意义的卓越贡献。
