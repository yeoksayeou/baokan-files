    Victory in Sight
    ·Chinese News Delegation·
    At the invitation of the South Vietnam Patriotic and Democratic Journalists Association, we visited the heroic land of South Vietnam and spent many days and nights of battle with the heroic people of South Vietnam. The land of South Vietnam is lovely. The towering peaks and vast forests of the Truong Son Mountains, the endless coconut groves along the central coast, the lush green grasslands of the Central Highlands, and the boundless emerald rice fields on both sides of the Tha Me Plain have all left us with unforgettable impressions. However, the brave people of South Vietnam are even more lovable than this magnificent natural scenery. In the troop camps deep in the dense forests, we listened to the stories of soldiers using bayonets and grenades to fiercely strike the American devils; in the winding trenches of the combat villages, we saw many young women who skillfully used rifles to kill the enemy, brave old men fighting heroically, old women rescuing the wounded, and little girls throwing grenades at enemy sentry posts. In the wind and rain, we marveled at teams of transport personnel carrying grain and ammunition in baskets made of wild vines, climbing steep cliffs to reach the front lines; in the dim light of oil lamps in small thatched huts, we saw white-haired old women and little girls gathered together, sewing and mending uniforms for the soldiers at the front. In these days spent with the people of South Vietnam, their revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism constantly inspired us, making us deeply proud to be with these comrades-in-arms.
      A Great Situation
    We visited various battlefields in South Vietnam and traveled over 2,000 kilometers of roads opened up by the blood and sweat of the South Vietnamese army and people. During our visit, we witnessed the tremendous changes that have shaken the world in the South Vietnamese battlefield since the beginning of 1965. The people's war, extensively carried out by the people of South Vietnam, has demonstrated its invincible power. The "special war" in which the United States provided guns, money, and advisors, and the South Vietnamese puppet regime provided troops, has been completely bankrupted. The 200,000 American aggressor troops who personally took the field have also suffered a tragic defeat. In the camps in the forests of the D liberated area near Saigon, we listened to the soldiers laugh about the hideous appearance of the American devils when they saw their bayonets and grenades in the battles of Duc Co, Bau Bang, and Dau Tieng. We also danced around bonfires in the Central Highlands with young men and women of ethnic minorities dressed in colorful clothes, to the melodious music of gongs, round drums, and bamboo tube zithers, sucking rice wine brewed in a wine jar with thin bamboo poles, celebrating the victory of the battle together. We visited the graveyard of the modern equipment of the US-puppet mechanized troops and the American "flying coffins" in the thickets of the vast swamps of the Tha Me Plain, and also saw the battlefield on the red highway of the Pleiku plateau, where the guerrillas ambushed the enemy convoy, with burned enemy tanks and trucks everywhere. In the suburbs of Da Nang, an important US military base occupied by tens of thousands of US Marines, we looked at the iron bridges, airports, and bunkers in the base with the guerrillas, mocking this American paper tiger in armor. We also looked at the lights in Saigon, the heart of the enemy's rule, on the Saigon River at night, and listened to the sound of gunfire from the guerrillas launching attacks inside and outside Saigon. No matter where they were, the American aggressors were trapped in the heavy encirclement of the South Vietnamese army and people, in a passive and beaten position.
    During our visit, we mostly traveled during the day, sometimes by bicycle and sometimes by boat. Except for a few enemy-occupied cities and strongholds, we traveled freely and in all directions. We visited farmers, workers, and soldiers along the way, and visited their combat villages, camps, and factories in the dense forests, and saw a thriving scene in the South Vietnamese liberated areas. Under the gas lamps in the newly liberated rural areas near Da Nang, we saw farmers excitedly raising their hands for the first time to elect the leaders of the local National Liberation Front committee. We also saw many men, women, old and young people in mutual aid teams transplanting rice seedlings in newly reclaimed wasteland in the old liberated areas of the Tha Me Plain, developing agricultural production. We visited small munitions factories deep in the dense forests, using unexploded enemy bombs and shells to make grenades and mines, and small factories using the debris of destroyed enemy planes and tanks to make daily necessities. We also visited small schools hidden under trees. In many places, children used tree bark to make ink, sharpened bamboo pieces into nibs, and used thin tree bark and the film inside thick bamboo branches as paper, overcoming the shortage of stationery. In the countryside near Saigon, we squeezed into a thatched hut with the farmers, enthusiastically applauding the wonderful performances of the propaganda team. In the printing factories in the mountainous forests, we watched the workers skillfully print one colorful victory report and propaganda item after another on stone printing plates. Our journey of more than 2,000 kilometers was full of passion and friendship. The Vietnamese comrades accompanying us said that in many places we passed through, before 1965, there were enemy strongholds everywhere, and one could not walk during the day, only at night. Some places could not even be walked at night, and one had to take a detour. Now, the South Vietnamese liberated areas are constantly expanding and consolidating in the victorious battles, and four-fifths of the land and more than ten million people have been liberated. Many previously divided liberated areas have been linked together. Our trip also reflects the excellent situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield.
      A Wall of Iron
    Throughout our visit, the magnificent scene of the large-scale people's war of the South Vietnamese people constantly excited us. On the nights of battle, teams of guerrillas wearing foliage camouflage, carrying machine guns and rifles, marched quickly along the roads in the jungle under the constant flares and blind strafing of enemy aircraft, heading to the enemy's burning encampment ahead to harass and attack the enemy. On the eve of fierce battles, batches of men and women of the transport army, in the howling of wind and rain, carried loads, pushed bicycles, and drove ox carts to send ammunition, grain, and supplies to the front-line troops. Overnight, thousands of people transformed the newly liberated enemy "strategic hamlets" into people's combat villages, and broke the enemy's strategic highways and railways into pieces. How many times have hundreds and thousands of women, old people, and children, including the families of puppet soldiers, carried the bodies of people who were innocently killed by the US-puppet troops, shouting anti-American slogans and rushed into the enemy's strongholds to demonstrate. In the great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, everyone has become a soldier, every village has become a battle fortress, and every inch of land has become the enemy's graveyard.
    We visited a combat village in a township in the Xin An-Di An liberated area, only a dozen kilometers away from Saigon. The Vietnamese comrade who guided us took us on a small boat across several wide and deep ditches, and through many trap and minefields, spiked bamboo fences and barbed wire, pointed stakes and trenches, before entering the village. More than 600 men, women, old and young people in the whole village have been organized. Young and middle-aged men and women joined the guerrillas, old women formed medical rescue teams, old men established logistics teams, and children joined the Young Pioneers. As long as the bamboo clapper in the village rings, everyone takes up a combat position and participates in the battle to defend their homes. Not long before our visit, they had just crushed a large-scale enemy "mopping-up" operation. That morning, more than 1,000 puppet soldiers led by American advisors came to the village in two ways from the air and on the ground to "mop up." The enemies from the air had just landed when they were attacked by the guerrillas' fierce fire, killing and wounding many people, and two helicopters were shot down. The enemies coming from the ground were also lured by the guerrillas into minefields and trapfields, and many more people lost their lives, and three tanks were destroyed. Later, the enemy concentrated artillery fire to bombard the village, and enemy planes continued to bomb and strafe. The guerrillas quickly moved into underground fortifications to persist in the battle, and drove the enemy back again and again. From morning until afternoon, the enemy entered the village, but found that the guerrillas and the masses had all been transferred from the trenches to another village. The enemy pushed open the door to enter the house, and a grenade exploded. They climbed in from the window, and a grenade also exploded. They reached into the chicken coop to catch chickens, and a grenade exploded again. Finally, the enemies were so scared that they all crowded in the open space in the village, and dared not move a step. Before dark, the enemy hurriedly retreated to their stronghold. However, on the way, they were ambushed by the guerrillas from several other villages, and left many corpses and wounded soldiers to flee for their lives. When the remaining enemies saw their stronghold and were glad that they had not lost their lives, suddenly fierce fire was shot at them from the stronghold. It turned out that the local armed forces in this area had taken the opportunity of their departure to "mop up" to have taken the opportunity to raid their old nest. The army and people in this area are united as one, forming a wall of iron. No matter how strong the enemy is, they cannot escape the fate of being annihilated.
    The Great Power
    of the People's Army
    It was during our visit to the southern battlefield that the American aggressors threw a large number of invading troops into the South Vietnamese battlefield, vainly attempting to seize the initiative on the battlefield. However, in the competition with the South Vietnamese army and people, the American aggressor troops were beaten like the puppet troops, unable to take care of both ends. We remember that when the US First Infantry Division, known as the "Big Red One," arrived on the battlefield near Saigon, the American aggressors had bragged about this "ace army," saying that the United States would no longer lose. The commander of the First Infantry Division also sent an open letter to the soldiers, asking them not to live up to the "Big Red One" emblem on their shoulders and to win glory for the American aggressors. This "ace army" did conduct a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the D liberated area near Saigon with a fierce momentum under the cover of a large number of planes and artillery. However, like the puppet troops, they failed one after another. Besides being killed and wounded by the guerrillas' sniper fire and mines, they could not even find a shadow of the Liberation Army. At that time, we were visiting a Liberation Army camp in the jungle not far away. The commanders were studying the opportunity to capture the American aggressor troops calmly on a map on a large table made of rough wood in the command post under a large tree. The scouts kept running back to report the actions of this American "ace army." The soldiers were wiping their weapons and ammunition, ready to receive the order to attack the American devils at any time. When the soldiers heard that the United States used all types of aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, and artillery of various calibers to indiscriminately bomb and bombard the uninhabited jungle, they could not help but laugh. One soldier satirically said, "Listen, the American devils' armed exercise is very lively." Another soldier added, "When they finish their exercise, we will find them and give them a good punch." Sure enough, this arrogant American aggressor army tasted the iron fist of the Liberation Army in mid-November last year, revealing the true form of a paper tiger.
    On November 10, more than 2,000 troops from the First Infantry Division set out from the US military stronghold in Lai Khe and "mopped up" the Bau Bang village to the north along the highway, attempting to capture the main force of the Liberation Army. This enemy force failed on the first day and established a camp north of Bau Bang village. It also failed on the second day. The cunning enemy moved the camp to the rubber garden south of Bau Bang village, preparing to continue the search on the third day. That night, the US military authorities in Saigon announced triumphantly, "The Viet Cong's main force in the Bau Bang area has escaped." However, they were happy too soon. The major forces of the Liberation Army in the southern region had already made combat preparations. After receiving the order, they immediately rushed towards Bau Bang village like countless arrows, quickly and covertly completing the encirclement of this enemy force before dawn that day. At dawn on the 12th, the Liberation Army launched a sudden and fierce attack on the sleeping enemy. The soldiers inserted themselves into the enemy's formation like small tigers, dividing the enemy and launching close combat with the enemy with bayonets and grenades. One unit broke into the enemy's field command post in more than ten minutes, completely destroying the enemy's command system. The Liberation Army annihilated all the enemies in just three hours, quickly withdrew from the battlefield after the battle, and returned to their camp. When we went to interview the camp of a heroic unit that participated in this battle, the American bombers were still bombing the Bau Bang battlefield extensively. However, in addition to eliminating many American wounded soldiers, they did not bomb a single Liberation Army soldier. The local people told us an interesting story: in this battle, only twelve American devils were left to escape back to the stronghold. The US military commander in Lai Khe gave each of them a medal to boost the morale of the invading troops. However, a few days later, when these twelve frightened American devils were incorporated into another unit and were about to depart for another "mopping-up" operation, they forgot about the medals and cried and shouted and refused to get on the bus. Then, the Liberation Army highly applied the combat art of people's war and continuously inflicted heavy blows on the First Infantry Division, annihilating its two armored battalions in Ganche on November 20, and annihilating one of its battalions and severely damaging several other battalions in Dau Tieng on December 5.
      Meeting with Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho
    Shortly after our visit to the South Vietnamese battlefield, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, warmly invited us to visit him. We followed the Vietnamese comrades who led us through the dense forest and came to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho's simple office and residence. This was a very small thatched shed, with no walls around it. The roof was made of a type of leaf that was not easily flammable. In the shed were a desk and a grass-green hammock. A piece of plastic cloth was hung at one end of the shed, with a map hanging on it. Two thin wooden boards were placed between the two pillars of the shed, with two rows of books on them. On the other side of the pillar, there was a cloth backpack and a flashlight. At this time, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho walked over with a smile. He was radiant, with slightly white hair on his temples, wearing a light yellow military uniform and anti-war shoes. After warmly shaking hands with us, he had a cordial conversation with us. He spoke in a firm and optimistic tone about the excellent situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield and about the South Vietnamese people's confidence in the inevitable victory of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. He said that the South Vietnamese army and people have brought into play the powerful power of people's war, trapping the American aggressors in a heavy encirclement. No matter how many troops the American aggressors send, no matter what weapons they use, they cannot change their passive and beaten predicament that is getting deeper and deeper. The South Vietnamese army and people are determined to fight to the end. No matter whether they have to fight for five years or ten years, no matter how many difficulties there are on the road ahead, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation will surely be victorious, and the American aggressors will surely be defeated. Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho's bold words are also the common belief and determination of the vast number of South Vietnamese people. The excellent situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield is encouraging the South Vietnamese army and people to continue to bravely advance in order to finally defeat the American aggressors.

    胜利在望
    ·中国新闻代表团·
    我们应越南南方爱国民主新闻工作者协会的邀请，访问了越南南方英雄的土地，同英雄的越南南方人民一起度过了许多战斗的日日夜夜。越南南方的土地是可爱的。长山山脉的兀突奇峰和浩瀚林海，中部沿海绵延的椰子林带，西原高原浓绿的茂密的大草原，塔梅平原两岸一望无际的青翠稻田，都给我们留下难忘的印象。然而，英勇的越南南方人民比这壮丽的自然景色更加可爱，在密林深处的部队营地里，我们倾听过战士们用刺刀和手榴弹痛打美国佬的战斗故事；在战斗村的曲曲折折的战壕里，我们会见过多少神枪杀敌的青年妇女、英勇战斗的老大爷、抢救伤员的老大娘和向敌人岗哨扔手榴弹的小姑娘。在狂风暴雨中，我们赞叹过一队又一队的运输队员用野藤制成的背篓背着粮食和弹药，攀登悬崖绝壁赶到前线去；在小茅屋里昏暗的油灯下，我们看到过头发花白的老大娘和小姑娘聚在一起，一针一线地给前线战士缝补军服。在这些同越南南方人民朝夕相处的日子里，他们的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神时刻激励着我们，使我们深为能同这些战友们在一起而感到无比自豪。
      一片大好形势
    我们访问了越南南方的各个战场，跋涉了大约二千多公里南越军民用血汗开辟出来的道路。我们在访问中看到了南越战场上从一九六五年初以来发生的震撼全世界的巨大变化。南越人民广泛开展的人民战争，显示了不可战胜的强大威力。由美国出枪、出钱、出顾问，南越伪政权出兵的“特种战争”已经彻底破产，二十万之众的美国侵略军亲自上阵也遭到了悲惨的失败。我们在西贡附近D解放区密林中的营地里，倾听战士们笑谈美国佬在德古、保邦、油汀的战斗中看到他们的刺刀和手榴弹时丧魂落魄的丑态，也在西原山区的篝火边同穿着色彩鲜艳的衣服的少数民族青年男女一起，在铜锣、圆鼓和竹管琴悠扬的乐声中跳舞，用细竹竿在一个酒坛里吸用大米酿成的酒，共同庆祝战斗的胜利。我们在塔梅平原一望无际的沼泽地的灌木林中参观过美伪机械化部队的现代化装备和美国“会飞的棺材”的坟场，也在波来古高原红色的公路上看到过游击队奇袭敌军车队后到处都是烧毁了的敌人坦克和卡车的战场。我们在盘踞着几万美国海军陆战队的美军重要基地岘港的市郊，同游击队员一起眺望这个基地内的铁桥、机场、碉堡，嘲笑这只披盔戴甲的美国纸老虎，也在夜晚的西贡河上眺望敌人统治的心脏西贡市内的灯火，倾听游击队在西贡市内外进行袭击的枪炮声。不论在什么地方，美国侵略者都陷在南越军民的重重围困之中，处于被动挨打的境地。
    我们在访问中几乎都是在白天走路，也有时骑自行车和坐船，除了少数敌占城市和据点外，到处自由来往、四通八达。我们在沿途访问了农民、工人和战士，参观了他们的战斗村、营地和密林中的工厂，看到了南越解放区一片欣欣向荣的气象。我们在岘港附近新解放农村的汽灯下，看到过农民们激动地第一次举手选举本乡民族解放阵线委员会的领导人，也在塔梅平原的老解放区里，看到过许多男女老少的变工组在新开垦的荒地里插秧，发展农业生产。我们参观过在密林深处的用敌军没有爆炸的炸弹和炮弹制造手榴弹和地雷的小军火厂、用被击毁的敌人飞机和坦克的残片制造日用器具的小工厂，也访问过树木掩蔽下的小学校，许多地方的孩子们用树皮泡成墨水，把竹片削成笔尖，用薄树皮和粗竹枝内的薄膜作为纸张，克服文具纸张不足的困难。我们在西贡附近的农村里，同农民挤在一间茅屋里，为文工队员们演出的精采节目热烈鼓掌，也在山区森林中的印刷工厂里，看工人们灵巧的手在石印版上印出一张又一张套色的捷报和宣传品。我们这二千多公里的行程，是充满了激情和友谊的行程。陪同我们的越南同志说，在我们走过的很多地方，在一九六五年以前，还是敌军据点林立，白天不能走，要到夜晚才能走，有些地方连夜晚也不能走，还要绕道走。现在，越南南方解放区在胜利的战斗中不断扩大和巩固，五分之四的土地和一千多万人口已经解放，过去许多被分割的解放区已联成一片。我们的这次行程，也正好反映了南越战场上的大好形势。
      人民的铜墙铁壁
    在我们访问的全部行程中，越南南方人民声势浩大的人民战争的雄伟情景始终激动着我们。在战斗的夜晚，一队又一队身上戴着枝叶的伪装、背着机枪、步枪的游击队员们，在敌机不断投掷照明弹和盲目扫射下，在丛林中的道路上疾步行进，奔向前面火光冲天的敌军宿营地去骚扰敌人，打击敌人。在激战的前夜，一批又一批男女运输大军，在狂风暴雨的呼啸声中，挑着担，推着自行车，赶着牛车，把弹药、粮食和物资送到前方部队去。在一夜之间，成千上万的群众把刚解放的敌人的“战略村”改建成为人民的战斗村，把敌人的战略公路和铁路破坏得支离破碎。有多少次，成百成千的妇女、老人、小孩，包括伪军的家属，抬着被美伪军无辜杀害的群众的尸体，喊着反美口号冲进敌人据点去示威游行。在伟大的抗美救国斗争中，每个人都变成了战士，每个村庄都成了战斗的堡垒，每寸土地都变成了敌人的坟场。
    我们访问了距离西贡只有十多公里的新安—堤岸解放区某乡的一个战斗村。引导我们的越南同志带着我们乘小船渡过了几道很宽很深的水沟，穿过了许多道陷阱和地雷阵、尖竹篱笆和铁丝网、尖桩和交通壕，才走进了村子。全村男女老幼六百多人都已组织起来，青壮男女参加了游击队，老大娘组成了医疗救护队，老大爷成立了后勤队，孩子们都参加了少年先锋队。只要村子里的竹梆一响，人人都走上战斗的岗位，投入了保卫家乡的战斗。在我们访问以前不久，他们刚刚粉碎了敌军一次大规模的“扫荡”。那天早晨，由美国顾问率领的一千多名伪军从空中和地面上分成两路到这个村子来“扫荡”。从空中来的敌人刚刚着陆，就遭到游击队的猛烈火力的攻击，被打死打伤很多人，两架直升飞机被击落。从地面上来的敌人也被游击队诱入了地雷阵和陷阱阵，又有许多人送了命，三辆坦克被炸毁。后来，敌人就集中炮火对村子进行轰击，敌机也不断轰炸扫射，游击队就迅速转入地下工事坚持战斗，一次又一次把敌人打了回去。从早晨一直打到下午，敌人才进入了村子，但是发现游击队和群众都已从交通壕里转移到另外一个村子里去了。敌人推门进屋，手榴弹爆炸了，从窗子里爬进去，手榴弹也爆炸了，伸手到鸡窝里抓鸡，手榴弹又爆炸了，最后吓得敌人都挤在村子里的空场上，一步也不敢动。在天黑以前，敌人急急忙忙撤回自己的据点。但是，他们在半路上又遭到另外几个村子游击队的伏击，丢下了许多尸体和伤兵夺路逃命。等残余的敌人看到自己的据点，庆幸自己没有送命的时候，突然据点里又向他们射出了猛烈的火力，原来这个区的地方武装乘他们出发“扫荡”的机会，已经抄掉了他们的老窝。这个地区的军民万众一心，结成了一道铜墙铁壁，不管任何强大的敌人，都逃不掉被歼灭的命运。
  子弟兵的
    强大威力
    正是我们在南部战场上访问的时候，美国侵略者把大批侵略军投入南越战场，妄图夺取战场的主动权。但是，在同南越军民较量中，美国侵略军象伪军一样被打得蒙头转向，顾了头顾不了尾。我们记得，当被称为“大红一”的美国第一步兵师到达西贡附近战场的时候，美国侵略者曾给这支
  “王牌军”大吹大擂过，说什么美国不再输掉了。第一步兵师的师长也给士兵们发了一封公开信，要他们不要辜负肩上“大红一”的标志，给美国侵略者争口气。这支“王牌军”确实气势汹汹地在大量飞机和大炮的掩护下，对西贡附近的D解放区进行了大规模的“扫荡”。但是，他们还是象伪军一样接连都扑了空，除了被游击队的狙击火力和地雷杀伤很多人外，连个解放军的影子也没有找到。那时，我们正在距离并不很远的丛林中的一个解放军营地里访问，指挥员们正在大树底下的指挥所里，伏在用粗木头钉成的大桌子上的一张地图上，镇静地研究捕捉美国侵略军的战机。侦察员们不断跑回来报告这支美国“王牌军”的行动。战士们都在擦拭武器和弹药，随时准备接受打击美国佬的命令。战士们当听到美国包括B—52战略轰炸机在内的各种类型的飞机和各种口径的大炮对空无一人的丛林滥施轰炸和轰击的时候，都禁不住哈哈大笑起来。一个战士讽刺地说，“你们听，美国佬的武装大演习打得多热闹。”另一个战士接着说，“等他们演习打完后，我们去找他们狠狠揍上一拳。”果然，这支狂妄的美国侵略军在去年十一月中旬尝到了解放军铁拳的滋味，现出了纸老虎的原形。
    十一月十日，第一步兵师二千多人的部队从莱溪的美军据点出发，沿公路向北边的保邦村进行“扫荡”，企图捕捉解放军的主力。这支敌军第一天就扑了空，在保邦村的北边建立了营地，第二天又扑了空，狡猾的敌人就把营地转移到保邦村南面的橡胶园里去，准备第三天继续进行搜索。当天晚上，西贡美军当局趾高气扬地宣布，“保邦地区的越共主力已经逃跑。”但是，他们高兴得早了一些。南部地区解放军各路大军早已作好了战斗准备，在接到命令以后，立刻象无数个箭头向保邦村疾进，在当天天亮以前迅速隐蔽地完成了对这支敌军的包围。十二日天刚拂晓，解放军对沉睡中的敌人发动了突然猛烈的攻击，战士们个个象小老虎一样插入敌阵，分割敌人，用刺刀和手榴弹同敌人展开了近战。一支部队在十多分钟内就打进了敌人的野战指挥所，全部打烂了敌人的指挥系统。解放军在仅仅三个小时内就歼灭了全部敌人，在战斗结束后迅速撤出战场，回到了自己的营地。当我们到参加这次战斗的一支英雄部队的营地采访时，美国的轰炸机还在对保邦战场大肆轰炸。但是，他们除了消灭了很多美国伤兵以外，一个解放军也没有炸到。当地的群众告诉我们一个有趣的故事：这支美国侵略军在这次战斗中，只剩下了十二个美国佬逃回了据点。莱溪的美军司令官为了给侵略军打气，给他们各人发了一枚奖章。但是，过不几天，这十二个被吓坏了的美国佬当被编入另外一支部队又要出发
  “扫荡”时，就忘记了奖章，大哭大喊不肯上车。接着，解放军又高度运用人民战争的战斗艺术，连续给第一步兵师以沉重的打击，十一月二十日在甘车消灭了它的两个装甲营，十二月五日又在油汀消灭了它的一个营和重创另几个营。
      会见阮友寿主席
    我们在南越战场访问不久以后，越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席热情地邀请我们到他那里去作客。我们跟着带领我们的越南同志穿过密林，来到了阮友寿主席的简朴的办公室和住处。这是一间很小的草棚，四周没有墙壁，屋顶是用一种不易着火的树叶编成的。棚子里放着一张办公桌，挂着一张草绿色的吊床。棚子的一端悬着一块塑料布，上面挂着一张地图。棚子的两个柱子间架着两块薄木板，放着两排书。另一边柱子上，挂着一个布背包和一个手电筒。这时，阮友寿主席笑着走过来了，他神采奕奕，两边鬓发上微微有些白发，身穿淡黄色的军服，脚穿抗战鞋。他同我们热烈握手后，同我们进行了亲切的谈话。他用坚定的和乐观的语调谈到了南越战场上的大好形势，谈到了南方人民抗美救国斗争必胜的信心。他说，南越军民发挥了人民战争的强大威力，使美国侵略者陷在重重包围之中。不管美国侵略者增派多少兵力，使用什么武器，都改变不了他们越陷越深的被动挨打的困境。南越军民决心战斗到底，不管还要打五年还是十年，不管在前进的道路上还有多大困难，越南人民抗美救国的斗争必定胜利，美国侵略者必定失败。阮友寿主席的豪言壮语，也是广大越南南方人民的共同信念和决心。南越战场上的一片大好形势，正在鼓舞着南越军民为最后打败美国侵略者继续奋勇前进。（附图片）
