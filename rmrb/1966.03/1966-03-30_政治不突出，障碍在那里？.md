    Political Prominence: Where are the Obstacles?
    Why has Wangdu County been unable to change its low-yield, backward appearance for a long time? The main reason is that political prominence has not truly been emphasized.
    Speaking for myself, I have four erroneous ideas:
      First, I thought that production backwardness can be seen immediately, while political backwardness is not easy to see. Even if political work is good, it won't work if the grain doesn't increase. I didn't realize that emphasizing politics is the biggest hard task, grasping the human factor, and improving people's thinking are the only ways to truly increase grain production.
    Second, I thought that good production can cover up a hundred shortcomings; high output means that political work is naturally good. Using production struggles to cover up class struggles; using administrative orders to replace the Party's policies, substituting administration for the Party, with the Party not managing the Party, preventing the Party's guidelines and policies from meeting the masses in a timely manner, hindering the enthusiasm of the masses for collective production; using material incentives to replace emphasizing politics, and cadre lines to replace mass lines. For cadres, emphasizing use and neglecting training; for Party members and the masses, emphasizing production and neglecting education, failing to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Third, I thought that politics can be grasped during slack periods, but only production can be emphasized during busy periods, separating politics and production. I didn't understand that the busier production is, the more ideological problems there are, and the more political work needs to be grasped. Politics is the commander, but it must be implemented in production.
    Fourth, I thought that politics is a guarantee, without realizing that it is the commander. Only talking about guarantee, but not about commander, actually reduces the proper status of politics.
    In short, I cannot consciously and regularly put political work first. Ultimately, I have not clearly realized that whether or not to emphasize politics is a fundamental issue of which road to take and in which direction to advance.
    In terms of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, especially in terms of transforming my own thinking, the gap with the People's Liberation Army is very large. Connecting with work more, connecting with thinking less; connecting with work methods more, connecting with ideological consciousness less; connecting with others more, connecting with myself less; connecting with other places more, connecting with this place less. Therefore, I am prone to getting angry and impatient at work, criticizing people inaccurately and indiscriminately, patiently listening to positive words, and impatiently listening to negative words. Sometimes it is not a "group speech hall," but a "one-person speech hall," where the individual has the final say. These are all because Mao Zedong Thought has not taken root in my mind.
    Through this small-scale rectification, I realized that whether or not to grasp the ideological revolutionization of people is a matter of whether or not to grasp class struggle; it is a matter of adhering to or not adhering to revolution; it is a matter of whether socialism advances or regresses. Whether or not to emphasize politics is actually a struggle between two guiding ideologies and two work lines: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

### 政治不突出，障碍在那里？

    政治不突出，  障碍在那里？
    望都县为什么长期不能改变低产落后面貌？主要是没有真正突出政治。
    就我来说，有四种错误的想法：
      一、认为生产落后了，马上就可以看出来，政治落后不容易看出来，政治工作再好，粮食上不去也不行。没有认识到突出政治，就是最大的硬任务，抓人的因素，提高人的思想，才能把粮食真正搞上去。
    二、认为生产好了可以遮百丑；产量高，政治工作就自然好。以生产斗争掩盖阶级斗争；以行政命令代替党的政策，以政代党，党不管党，使党的方针政策，不能及时和群众见面，障碍群众集体生产的积极性；以物质刺激代替突出政治，以干部路线代替群众路线。对干部，重使用，轻培养；对党员、群众，重生产，轻教育，不用毛主席思想武装他们的头脑。
    三、认为闲时可以抓政治，忙时只能突出生产，把政治和生产分家。不了解生产越忙，思想问题越多，越需要抓政治工作。政治是统帅，但必须落脚到生产上。
    四、认为政治是保证，而没有认识到是统帅。只讲保证，不讲统帅，实际是降低了政治应有的地位。
    总之，不能自觉地、经常地把政治工作放在首位。归根到底，还没有明确认识到：突不突出政治，是一个走什么道路、朝什么方向前进的根本问题。
    在活学活用毛主席著作方面，和解放军比起来，特别是联系自己的思想进行自我改造方面，差距很大。联系工作多，联系思想少；联系工作方法多，联系思想意识少；联系别人多，联系自己少；联系外地多，联系本地少。因而工作中好发火，好急躁，批评人不准确，不择方式，耐心听正面话，不耐心听反面的话，有时不是“群言堂”，是“一言堂”，个人说了算。这些都是毛泽东思想没有在自己头脑里扎根的缘故。
    通过这次小整风，认识到抓不抓人的思想革命化，就是抓不抓阶级斗争的问题；就是坚持革命不坚持革命的问题；就是关系到社会主义前进，还是倒退的问题。突不突出政治，实际上是无产阶级同资产阶级两种指导思想、两种工作路线的斗争。
