    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th—The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué on the 8th regarding the brilliant achievement of the army and people of North Vietnam in shooting down the nine hundredth American bandit aircraft. The communiqué praised this glorious achievement and called on them to continue to advance courageously and strive for new and greater victories.
    The communiqué said that after the failure of the Johnson clique's "peace discussion" scam, they brazenly sent out planes to expand their attacks on North Vietnam. At the same time, in South Vietnam, they frantically adopted a "scorched earth" policy of so-called "destroying everything, burning everything, and killing everyone," and repeatedly used chemical poisons to destroy crops and kill residents and livestock. This is an extremely barbaric crime by the American bandits and their running dogs. These bloodthirsty fellows have lost all humanity. The Vietnamese people warn the American war criminals: Those who play with fire will perish by it. The blood debt owed by the American war criminals must be repaid with blood. The South Vietnamese puppet clique, who led the wolf into the house, will also be severely punished.
    The communiqué said that the great victory of the army and people of North Vietnam in shooting down nine hundred American aircraft and the recent glorious achievements of the army and people of South Vietnam eloquently demonstrate that the strength of the Vietnamese people is invincible, and the Vietnamese army and people have the ability and determination to defeat the American bandits on the ground and in the air.
    The communiqué sternly warned the American bandits that no matter how frantically they intensify and expand the war, and no matter what cunning and brutal methods they employ, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous and shameful defeats.
    The communiqué said that the Vietnamese army and people will continue to hold high the glorious banner of President Ho Chi Minh's "determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits," defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the motherland.

    越南人民军总司令部就击落美机第九百架发表公报
    号召军民奋勇前进争取新的更大胜利
    新华社河内八日电  越南人民军总司令部八日就越南北方军民击落美国强盗飞机第九百架发表公报，赞扬越南北方军民这一辉煌战功，并号召他们继续勇敢前进，争取新的更大的胜利。
    公报说，在约翰逊集团的“和平讨论”骗局失败后，他们又悍然出动飞机扩大袭击越南北方，同时，在越南南方疯狂地采取所谓“毁光、烧光、杀光”的“焦土”政策，接连使用化学毒剂破坏庄稼，杀害居民和家畜。这是美国强盗及其走狗极端野蛮的罪行，这些嗜血的家伙已经丧尽人性。越南人民警告美国战争罪犯：玩火者必自焚，美国战争罪犯欠下的血债必须以血偿还。引狼入室的南越走狗集团也必将遭到严厉的惩罚。
    公报说，越南北方军民击落九百架美国飞机的重大胜利和南方军民最近取得的辉煌战功，雄辩地说明越南人民的力量是无敌的，越南军民有足够的能力和决心战胜地面上的和空中的美国强盗。
    公报严厉警告美国强盗，不管他们疯狂地把战争加强和扩大到什么程度，玩弄什么样的狡猾和残暴的手段，他们都必将遭到更加惨重的和可耻的失败。
    公报说，越南军民一定继续高举胡志明主席的“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的光辉旗帜，保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国。
