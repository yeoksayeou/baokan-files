    From Unable to Afford to Affordable
    In Wenzhou and Ningbo, Zhejiang, two types of river mud suction boats have emerged. In the past, they only performed in the waterways, and the commune members didn't welcome them, but now they are starting to be promoted and used. How did this change come about?
    In the waterways near Wenzhou and Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, a few months ago, two new types of agricultural machinery appeared—river mud suction boats. Commune members flocked to visit them, praising the mud suction boats for using less manpower, sucking mud quickly, and having high efficiency. Many production team cadres happily calculated how to get one for their team.
    However, just a year ago, river mud suction boats were only doing demonstrations in the waterways. Because the machines were too expensive, the peasants couldn't afford them. How did they go from being unaffordable to affordable? There is a tortuous process here.
    In the Wenzhou and Ningbo areas of Zhejiang Province, there are large areas of flat, river-networked land, and the broad masses of commune members have historically had the habit of using river mud as base fertilizer. However, in the past, manually collecting river mud was very inefficient, and it took a lot of labor every year. Therefore, as early as three years ago, the relevant leading departments in Zhejiang Province arranged for the design personnel of the mechanical research institutes in these two regions to carry out the trial production of river mud suction machines.
    After receiving this task, the design personnel of the Wenzhou Municipal Mechanical Research Institute first drove wooden boats through the large and small rivers of the suburbs of Wenzhou City, observed the hand-operated mud collecting tools, and then proposed many mud suction schemes. After analysis and comparison, they finally decided to adopt the closed suction technical route, carried out prototype design, installed water pumps, mud pumps, vacuum pumps, as well as pipelines and suction heads in a steel plate boat, and a propeller at the stern. Due to the complex structure and many parts, it took twenty horsepower to drive, and the hull was also very large. At that time, the design researchers also felt that it should be made more impressive and more mechanized, so they specially equipped the boat with electrical devices, electric start, electric horn, and traffic lights.
    The news that the river mud suction boat was successfully trial-produced quickly spread throughout the rural areas, and nearby farmers happily told each other. The mud suction boat performed in the river in the suburbs, with good mud suction quality and high efficiency. It could fill a boat with river mud in three minutes. People looked at the mud suction boat again and again, touched it again and again, and praised it incessantly. Just as everyone was excited, a commune member asked, "How much does one cost?"
    "Twelve thousand yuan," the technician replied.
    "Oh my, how much rice does it take to buy a river mud suction boat! We can't afford it," the farmer said, shaking his head repeatedly.
    The technicians, who thought that the successful trial of the mud suction boat could be handed in, were shocked when they heard "We can't afford it." This sentence from the peasants triggered a heated debate among the researchers who had worked hard on design and testing for more than a year. Many people advocated redesigning to reduce costs, otherwise the peasants would not be able to afford it, and the machine would be useless no matter how good it was; some people also believed that the existing river mud suction boat had a reasonable structure and the technology had passed the test, and there was nothing to change anymore. Even with minor repairs and modifications, it would still require those parts, and the cost would still be tens of thousands of yuan. Some design personnel also said: "Whether the machine is easy to use is the responsibility of the technical department. As for whether others can afford it or not, that should be considered by the state. For example, if a good car is designed and manufactured, but there is no good road, you can't blame the car for being bad!" Others said: "As long as we design and manufacture good machines, are we afraid that no one will want them? At least state-owned farms can use them." Still others said: "If the peasants can't afford it, the state can provide loan support."
    Should the research and design of agricultural machinery products consider whether the peasants can afford it or not? The leaders of the Wenzhou Municipal Mechanical Research Institute believed that the mud suction boat had been created, but the price was too high, the peasants did not welcome it, and no one would buy it, so the thing would be useless no matter how good it was. Therefore, it was decided to learn from this experience and lesson and improve the design. After more than thirty trials, some parts were simplified, and the cost was reduced from 12,000 yuan to more than 5,000 yuan, and the machine was more flexible and easier to operate than before. Later, this type of river mud suction boat was gradually promoted and used in various places. At present, the Wenzhou Municipal Mechanical Research Institute is further designing and testing semi-mechanized river mud mechanical equipment with high mud suction quality and lower prices.
    The river mud suction boat designed and manufactured by the Ningbo Special District Industrial Science Research Institute was also very expensive at first. One day, the director of the research institute and the technicians drove the river mud suction boat they designed to the river in the countryside to test mud suction. Some commune members saw that some of the machines on the mud suction boat were similar to the machines on their team's water pumping boat, and said: "Can we modify our team's water pumping boat to be a boat that can both pump water and suck mud? It would be great to use one boat for multiple purposes!"
    This reminder from the peasants enlightened the researchers. The director of the research institute and the technicians immediately went to the countryside to investigate and learned that many production teams had water pumping boats, and the boats had water pumps and diesel engines. Water pumping boats only pump water for three or four months a year, and the utilization rate is very low. It is indeed a good idea to use the equipment on the boats to turn them into boats for multiple purposes. They calculated the accounts carefully. It would cost at least three to four thousand yuan to build a new river mud suction boat, and it would cost more than two tons of steel to build a steel plate hull river mud suction boat. Through discussions and interviews, they consulted with the peasants and decided to use the original power of the water pumping boat to convert the water pump so that it could both pump water and suck mud. In this way, by spending only a small amount of money, the water pumping boat could be turned into an agricultural boat for pumping water, sucking mud, and transporting.
    In the design and modification, the technicians and workers carefully calculated and strived to reduce costs. As a result, it only cost more than 700 yuan to modify a three-purpose boat, and it performed well after actual operation.

    从买不起到买得起
    浙江的温州和宁波，出现了两种吸河泥机船。过去它们只是在河道里表演表演，社员并不欢迎，而现在已经开始推广使用。这个变化是怎么发生的呢？
    在浙江省温州、宁波附近的河道里，几个月前出现了两种新型的农业机械——吸河泥机船。社员们成群结队地前去参观，人们称赞吸泥机船使用人力少、吸泥快、工效高，许多生产队干部高兴地盘算着，要为队里办一台。
    可是，在一年以前，吸河泥机船只不过在河道里表演表演罢了。因为机器价格太贵，农民买不起。怎么会由从买不起到买得起呢？这里有个曲折的过程。
    浙江省温州、宁波地区有大片的平原水网地带，广大社员过去就有捻河泥作基肥的习惯。但是，过去用人工捻河泥，效率很低，每年要花很多劳动力。因此，浙江省有关领导部门早在三年前就布置这两个地区机械研究所的设计人员进行吸河泥机的试制工作。
    温州市机械研究所的设计人员接到这个任务以后，先驾着木船驶遍了温州市郊大小河流，观察手工捻泥工具，然后提出了许多吸泥方案。经过分析比较，最后确定采取闷吸式的技术路线，进行样机设计，在钢板船内装了水泵、泥泵、真空泵，还有管道和吸头，船尾有推进器。由于结构复杂，部件很多，要二十马力才能带动，船身也很大。当时设计研究人员还觉得应当搞得更象样一点，机械化程度高一些，于是，又特地在船上配了电气装置、电启动、电喇叭、红绿灯。
    吸河泥机船试制成功的消息很快传遍四乡农村，附近农民高兴得奔走相告。吸泥机船在郊区河里表演，吸泥质量好、功效高，三分钟就能吸满一船河泥，人们围着吸泥机船看了又看，摸了又摸，啧啧称赞。正当大家兴高采烈的时候，一个社员问：“要多少钱一台？”
    “一万二千元”，技术员回答说。
    “啊呀，这要多少稻谷才能买一台吸泥机船呀！我们买不起。”农民连连摇头说。
    满以为吸泥机船试验成功可以交卷的技术人员，一听“我们买不起”，不觉大吃一惊。农民的这一句话，在辛辛苦苦设计试验了一年多时间的研究人员中间，引起了一场热烈争论。很多人主张要重新设计，降低造价，否则农民买不起，机器再好也发挥不了作用；也有些人认为现有的吸河泥机船结构合理，技术已过关，再没有什么好改了，即使小修小改，还是要那些部件，造价总要万把元。有的设计人员还说：“机器好不好用是技术部门的责任，至于别人买得起买不起，那是应该由国家去考虑的事。比如设计制造出好汽车，如果没有好公路，总不能怪汽车不好呀！”也有的说：“我们只要设计制造出好机器，还怕没人要？至少国营农场总可以用。”还有人说：“农民买不起，国家可以贷款扶持嘛”。
    农业机械产品研究设计究竟要不要考虑农民买得起买不起呢？温州市机械研究所的领导上认为，吸泥机船是创造出来了，但是价格太高，农民不欢迎，没人买，东西再好也是白搭。于是决定吸取这次的经验教训，改进设计。经过三十多次试验，有些部件简化了，造价也从一万二千元降低到五千多元，而且机器比原来灵巧，操作方便。后来这种吸河泥机船就在各地逐步推广使用。目前，温州市机械研究所还在进一步设计试验吸泥质量高、价钱更低的半机械化吸河泥机械设备。
    宁波专区工业科学研究所设计制造的吸泥机船，原来造价也很高。一天，研究所主任和技术员驶着他们设计的吸河泥机船到农村河里试验吸泥。有些公社社员，看到了吸泥机船上有的机器和自己队里的抽水机船上的机器差不多，就说：“我们队里的抽水机船好不好改成能抽水又能吸泥的船呢？一船多用，那多好呀！”
    农民这一提醒，使研究人员的思想开了窍，研究所主任和技术人员立即到农村调查，了解到许多生产队都有抽水机船，船上有水泵，有柴油机。抽水机船一年中抽水时间只有三、四个月，利用率很低，把船上的设备利用起来，变成一船多用，这的确是一个好主意。他们算了一笔细账，新造一条吸泥机船至少要三、四千元，造一条钢板船壳的吸泥机船要花两吨多钢材。他们通过座谈访问，和农民商量，决定利用原来抽水机船上的动力，将水泵改装为既能抽水又能吸泥，这样只花少量钱，就可以使抽水机船变为抽水、吸泥、运输三用的农船了。
    技术人员和工人在设计改装中，精打细算，努力降低费用，结果只花了七百多元就改装成一台三用船，经过实地操作，性能良好。
