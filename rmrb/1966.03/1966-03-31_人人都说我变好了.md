    Everyone Says I Have Improved
    Li Genyuan, narrated, Taiyuan Television Work-Study Middle School, compiled
    My name is Li Genyuan. I am sixteen years old and a second-year student in the Yongding Road television class at Taiyuan Television Work-Study Middle School. When I first arrived at the television class, I was a notorious "troublemaker," "fighting king," and "underachiever." The teachers couldn't do anything with me, and the students all hated and feared me. Now, everyone who knows me says: Li Genyuan has improved. How did I transform from a "troublemaker" into an outstanding team member?
        How I Picked Up Bad Habits
    My father is an old worker who pulls a flatbed cart, and my mother has been sick for a long time. Our family life is quite difficult. In 1958, my mother died, and my two older sisters also got married one after another. Only my father, younger brother, and I were left at home. Since there was no one to take care of me at home, I often played outside and got into fights. When I returned home, I had to carry water, cook, wash clothes, and mend clothes. At school, I often worried about things at home, couldn't concentrate on what the teacher was saying, and my grades were consistently poor. Coupled with my love for causing trouble and fighting, some teachers didn't like me.
    I spent six years in elementary school and caused trouble for six years. I was frequently criticized by teachers.
    After graduating from senior elementary school, I didn't get into middle school. From June to October 1964, I idled at home for a full four months, playing outside all day.
    From senior elementary school onwards, I had known a few "friends." I played marbles with them. Once, I was walking with them on the street, and they suddenly entered a courtyard. I waited outside for a while, but they didn't come out. When I followed them in, there was an old man in the yard, and my "friends" were reselling something to the old man. Later, they took me to a restaurant and shared half a bowl of noodles with me. In this way, I was gradually influenced by the bad influence of those so-called "friends" and gradually picked up bad habits.
        "I Will Also Oppose Her"
    In October 1964, the principal of the elementary school said to me: "The Television Work-Study Middle School is recruiting students. Go to the television class to study." My father and elder sister also said the same.
    I wasn't interested in attending television school. My eyesight was poor, and when the teacher asked me to sit in the second row, I insisted on sitting in the last row. During class, I made a fool of myself in the back, causing everyone to turn around and look at me; I picked up furnace ash and made the classroom smoky. Once, during class, a classmate and I filled a penholder with rice and blew it at whoever was listening attentively. After one semester, I only scored sixteen points in algebra.
    I often fought with classmates. I was tall and strong, and I never lost a fight. After I hit someone, I didn't allow them to tell the teacher. If anyone told, I would beat them even more severely. In this way, I beat up all the classmates in the class. I not only bullied classmates in my class, but also bullied elementary school students in the school. I fought from inside the class to outside the class, and from the school to the neighborhood.
    Our television class counselor, Teacher Ping, had just graduated from middle school. I figured she couldn't do anything with me. I deliberately annoyed her. She said a few words to me, and I would retort with a few words. I thought: Humph! If she opposes me, I will also oppose her!
          Under the Education of the Teacher
    Gradually, I found that Teacher Ping's attitude towards me was quite good. She often talked to me about my thoughts. At first, I didn't care whether I listened or not, but Teacher Ping was very patient. If I liked to listen, she would talk; if I didn't like to listen, she would still talk. She also bought me the book "The Vanguard in Studying Chairman Mao's Writings - Liao Chujiang," and asked me to study hard and guide me in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Slowly, I was able to listen to some of her words. I secretly thought: Teacher Ping is putting so much effort into me, talking to me about my thoughts every day. Teacher Ping is truly doing this for my own good.
    Teacher Ping took us to the Victory Binding Society to work. Speaking of labor, I was really energetic. I loved to work and loved to pick up heavy tasks since I was little. Entering the Television Work-Study Middle School, studying and working at the same time, this was right up my alley. I wasn't afraid of getting dirty or suffering when I worked, and I worked quickly. Teacher Ping discovered this advantage of mine, praised me in public, and asked me to help other students. The old workers praised me for doing a good job too. I was actually being praised, which was something I never thought would happen. During labor, I also had shortcomings, such as often being late, liking to joke around, being careless about quality when doing light work, and sometimes not paying attention to safety when doing heavy work. However, the old workers were very strict with us. Under their education and help, I gradually became able to abide by labor discipline. At the same time, I also slowly got rid of my bad habit of not following discipline in learning.
    Starting from this point of labor, Teacher Ping's praise and encouragement for me became more and more frequent. Strangely, in the past, teachers always criticized my shortcomings, but I could never change these shortcomings. Now, the more Teacher Ping praised my advantages, the more I wanted to overcome my shortcomings. The students' attitude towards me also changed. They all played with me and helped me study. I liked sports activities, and everyone let me be the sports committee member in the class. I began to worry about the affairs of the whole class and serve the students in the whole class.
    Teacher Ping asked me to study Chairman Mao's writings. At first, I didn't know what Chairman Mao's writings were talking about. Under Teacher Ping's inspiration, I studied articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I saw in "Serve the People" that: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of anyone pointing out our shortcomings. Anyone can point them out to us. If you are right, we will correct them." These words were like they were saying to me. I said in a class meeting: "In the past, I hated others criticizing me. Now I know that classmates criticizing me is helping me. I must accept criticism and correct myself." After studying these articles, I became interested in Chairman Mao's writings. I saved money and bought a "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" (Type B) and began to study. Teacher Ping also gave me a notebook. After studying, I wrote my心得 (xinde - understandings/reflections) in the notebook.
    Teacher Ping was very concerned about me in both learning and life. She knew that my foundation was poor, so she helped me with tutoring, corrected my homework face-to-face, and even asked me to go to her home on Sundays for tutoring. My pen broke and I couldn't do my homework. Teacher Ping gave me her own pen, which made me very moved.
      From "Troublemaker" to Outstanding Team Member
    I really changed. In the past, I couldn't even manage myself well. Now, I can not only manage myself well, but also help others. In the middle of the second semester of the first year, I was elected as the class president. In addition to doing a good job as the class president, I also tried my best to do good deeds for the people around me. My academic performance is also gradually improving. Last semester, my algebra score reached seventy-eight points. The teachers all said that I have improved, the neighbors also said that I have improved, and my father no longer beats me. The elementary school students and children who I used to beat up have also become close to me.
      On "June 1st" Children's Day, I was rated as an outstanding team member by the school. That night, I was so happy that I couldn't sleep. I thought, if the Party and the government hadn't established television work-study middle schools for us, troublemakers like me wouldn't know what kind of people we would have become, let alone become outstanding team members? I thank the Party and the government for their concern for our younger generation. I must continue to move forward and be a firm revolutionary successor.

    人人都说我变好了
    李根源  口述  太原电视工读中学  整理
    我叫李根源，今年十六岁，是太原电视工读中学永定路电视班二年级的学生。我刚到电视班的时候，是出名的“捣蛋鬼”、“打架王”、“差等生”，老师拿我没有办法，同学都恨我，怕我。现在，认得我的人都说：李根源变好了。我是怎样从一个“捣蛋鬼”变成了优秀队员的呢？
        我怎样沾染上坏习气的
    我爸爸是一个拉平车的老工人，妈妈长期有病，家庭生活比较困难。一九五八年，妈妈死了，两个姐姐也先后出嫁，家里只剩下爸爸、弟弟和我三个人。家里没人照顾我，我就经常在外边玩，打架。回到家里，还得担水、做饭、洗衣服、补衣服。到了学校，我经常惦记着家里的事，老师讲的听不进去，学习成绩一直很差，再加上爱捣蛋打架，一些老师都不喜欢我。
    我在小学里念了六年书，就捣了六年蛋。我经常受到老师的批评。
    高小毕业以后，我没有考上中学。一九六四年六月到十月，我在家里整整闲荡了四个月，成天在外边玩。
    从高小的时候起，我就认识了几个“朋友”。我跟他们一起打过弹子。有一次，我跟他们在街上走着，他们忽然进了一个院子。我在外面等了一阵，不见他们出来，跟进去一看，院里有个老头，我的那些“朋友”正在跟老头倒卖什么东西。后来他们引我进了饭馆，分给我半碗面吃。就这样，我慢慢地受到了那几个所谓
  “朋友”的坏影响，逐渐地沾染了坏习气。
        “我也会跟她作对”
    一九六四年十月，小学里的校长跟我说：“电视工读中学招生了，你去电视班学习吧。”我爸爸和大姐也这样说。
    我对上电视学校不感兴趣。我的眼睛不好，老师让我坐在第二排，我偏要坐在最后一排。上课的时候，我在后面出洋相，逗得大家回过头来看我；我把炉灰挑起来，弄得满教室乌烟瘴气。有一次，上课的时候，我跟一个同学把大米装在钢笔杆里，看见谁在用心听讲，就对准谁吹过去。一学期下来，我的代数只考了十六分。
    我常常跟同学们打架。我个儿高，力气大，打架是从来不吃亏的。我打了人，还不准他们告诉老师，谁要告了，我就把他打得更厉害。就这样，我打遍了全班的同学，我不但欺负同班同学，而且还欺负所在学校的小学生。我从班内打到班外，又从学校打到街坊上。
    我们电视班的辅导员平老师是刚从中学毕业出来的。我瞧她对我也没有办法。我故意气她。她说我几句，我也顶她几句。我想：哼！她跟我作对，我也会跟她作对！
          在老师的教育下
    慢慢地，我发现平老师对我的态度挺好，经常跟我谈思想，起初我爱听不听的，可是平老师很耐心，我爱听，她也谈；我不爱听，她也谈。她还给我买了《学习毛主席著作的尖兵——廖初江》这本书，让我好好学习，并且指导我学习毛主席著作。慢慢地，我能听她的一些话了。我暗暗想：平老师在我身上下这么大的辛苦，天天这样跟我谈思想，平老师真正是为了我好。
    平老师带我们到胜利装订社去劳动。说起劳动来，我可带劲啦。我从小就爱劳动，爱拣重活干。进了电视工读中学，一边读书，一边劳动，这一点倒是对我的劲。我劳动起来不怕脏，不怕苦，而且干得快。平老师发现了我这个优点，当众表扬了我，还让我帮助别的同学。老工人见我干得好，也表扬我。我居然也能受到表扬，这真是想也没有想过的事。在劳动中，我也是有缺点的，比如我常迟到，爱说笑，干轻活儿有时候马马虎虎，不注意质量，干重活儿有时候不注意安全。可是老工人对我们要求很严格，在他们的教育、帮助下，我逐步能遵守劳动纪律了。同时，我也慢慢地改掉了学习上不遵守纪律的坏习惯。
    从劳动这一点开始，平老师对我的表扬和鼓励越来越多了。说也奇怪，从前老师总是批评我的缺点，可我怎么也改不了这些缺点；现在平老师越是表扬我的优点，我就越想克服自己的缺点。同学们对我的态度也变了，他们都跟我一起玩，并且帮助我学习。我爱好体育活动，大家让我担任班上的体育委员。我开始为全班的事操心，为全班的同学服务了。
    平老师让我学毛主席著作，我起初不知道毛主席著作究竟说些什么。在平老师的启发下，我学习了《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。我看到《为人民服务》里说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”这几句话，就象对我说的一样。我在全班会上发言说：“过去我讨厌别人批评我，现在我才知道，同学们批评我是帮助我。我一定接受批评，好好改正。”学了这几篇文章以后，我对毛主席著作有了兴趣。我省下钱买了一本《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本，开始学习。平老师还给了我一本笔记本，我学了以后，就把心得写在笔记本上。
    平老师在学习上和生活上都对我很关心。她知道我基础差，就帮我补课，当面批改我的作业，星期天还让我到她家里去补习功课。我的钢笔坏了，不能做作业，平老师就把自己的钢笔给了我，使我很受感动。
      从“捣蛋鬼”到优秀队员
    我真的变了。过去我是连自己也管不好的，现在我不但能管好自己，而且能帮助别人了。一年级下学期期中，我被选为班主席。我除了做好班主席工作以外，还尽量多给周围的人做好事。我的学习成绩也在逐步上升，上学期代数成绩达到了七十八分。老师们都说我变好了，邻居们也说我变好了，我爸爸也不再打我了，过去被我打过的小学生、小朋友，也跟我亲近起来了。
      “六一”儿童节的时候，我被学校评为优秀队员。那天晚上，我高兴得睡不着觉。我想，要不是党和政府为我们办起了电视工读中学，象我这样的“捣蛋鬼”，还不知道会变成什么样的人，哪里会成为优秀队员呢？我感谢党和政府对我们青少年一代的关怀。我一定要继续前进，做一个坚定的革命接班人。
