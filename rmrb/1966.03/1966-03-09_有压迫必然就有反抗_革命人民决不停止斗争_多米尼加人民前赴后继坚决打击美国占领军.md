    Where There is Oppression, There is Resistance. Revolutionary People Will Never Stop Fighting.
    The Dominican People Advance Wave Upon Wave to Resolutely Strike the U.S. Occupation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Santo Domingo: Residents of the Dominican capital continue to take action to strike the lingering U.S. occupation army. A group of Dominican patriots used stones to attack a U.S. invading army vehicle in the downtown area of the capital on the 5th, and shot and wounded a U.S. soldier in the vehicle. The patriots also threw a grenade at a jeep of the U.S.-controlled "Inter-American Force", injuring two American lackeys in the "Inter-American Force."
    On the same day, the people of the Dominican capital held a funeral for a female student who was killed by reactionary Dominican police during an anti-American demonstration held on February 9th. At the end of the funeral, a small group of reactionaries suddenly opened fire and threw grenades at the masses attending the funeral, injuring three people. The people attending the funeral were enraged by the new atrocities of the reactionaries and immediately held a fierce protest demonstration in the streets. The atrocities of the U.S. invading army and the Dominican reactionary military police in suppressing the demonstrating masses on February 9th triggered a new and sustained anti-American storm in the Dominican Republic, and Dominican workers held a nationwide protest strike.
    In order to ease the people's struggle, the Dominican puppet authorities announced on February 16 that the pro-American right-wing military leaders, former Army Chief of Staff Martinez Arana and former Air Force Commander Santos Cespedes, who had been assigned to diplomatic positions abroad, would leave the Dominican Republic. However, after a conspiracy by the United States and the Dominican reactionary armed forces, the puppet authorities formally appointed Arana as Deputy Minister of the Dominican Army and Cespedes as Deputy Minister of the Air Force on February 26. This kind of conspiracy was strongly opposed by the Dominican people. In recent days, anti-American demonstrations and attacks on the U.S. invading army have been continuously occurring in the Dominican capital.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, in the armed struggle of the Dominican people to fight for national sovereignty and oppose U.S. aggression that broke out in April last year, the heroic Dominican women played a great role. From the beginning of the struggle on April 24, patriotic women took to the streets with other patriotic soldiers and civilians and actively participated in the struggle for the liberation of their motherland. In the heroic struggle with the U.S. invading army, patriotic women from all walks of life braved the flames of war to bandage wounds, transport food, weapons, make bombs, and hide weapons for patriotic soldiers and civilians, and actively participated in military training and anti-American battles.

    有压迫必然就有反抗  革命人民决不停止斗争
    多米尼加人民前赴后继坚决打击美国占领军
    新华社六日讯  圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都居民继续采取行动来打击赖着不走的美国占领军。一群多米尼加爱国者五日在首都闹市区用石块袭击了一辆美国侵略军的车辆，并且开枪打伤了车上的一名美国兵。爱国者还向美国控制的“泛美部队”的一辆吉普车投掷手榴弹，炸伤了两名“泛美部队”中的美国的仆从军。
    在同一天，多米尼加首都人民为在二月九日举行的反美示威中被多米尼加反动警察杀害的一名女学生举行了葬礼。在葬礼结束的时候，一小撮反动分子突然向参加葬礼的群众开枪、扔手榴弹，有三名群众受伤。参加葬礼的人们被反动分子的新的暴行所激怒，立即在大街上举行了激烈的抗议示威。美国侵略军和多米尼加反动军警二月九日镇压示威群众的暴行，曾经在多米尼加引起声势浩大的新的持续的反美风暴，多米尼加工人举行了全国性的抗议罢工。
    为了缓和人民的斗争，多米尼加傀儡当局二月十六日宣布早被指派到国外担任外交职务的亲美右翼军事头目、前陆军参谋长马丁内斯·阿拉纳和前空军司令桑托斯·塞斯佩德斯将离开多米尼加。但是，经过美国和多米尼加反动武装部队的阴谋策划，傀儡当局二月二十六日又正式任命阿拉纳为多米尼加陆军部副部长，塞斯佩德斯为空军部副部长。这种阴谋手法遭到了多米尼加人民的强烈反对。最近几天，多米尼加首都不断发生反美示威和袭击美国侵略军的活动。
    据新华社讯  在去年四月爆发的多米尼加人民争取民族主权、反对美国侵略的武装斗争中，英勇的多米尼加妇女起了很大的作用。从四月二十四日斗争一开始，爱国妇女就同其他爱国军民一起走上街头，积极参加争取祖国解放的斗争。在同美国侵略军展开的英勇搏斗中，各阶层的爱国妇女冒着战火替爱国军民包扎伤口、运送食物、武器、制造炸弹、掩藏军火，并且积极地参加了军事训练和反美战斗。（附图片）
