    Be Vigilant Against Another Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy of US-British Imperialism in the Middle East
    Arab Countries Condemn US-British Plot to Establish "Islamic Treaty" Group to Suppress National Democratic Movements
    Kings of Saudi Arabia and Iran Publicly Initiate Islamic Summit to Serve US-British Interests
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th – Our correspondent reports: Since the end of last year, clandestine activities to piece together a so-called “Islamic Treaty” have suddenly emerged in the Middle East. However, as soon as it surfaced, its true face was exposed, and the people of Arab countries rose up in angry denunciation.

    Arab public opinion quickly pointed out that this "Treaty" is a military and political alliance planned by the United States and Britain, cloaked in Islamic religious garb, with the aim of suppressing national democratic movements in the region and dividing the ranks of Arab countries.

    News of US-British imperialism plotting this treaty began to leak out as early as last December, before Saudi Arabian King Faisal's visit to Iran. Western newspapers reported as early as last December that Washington had instructed King Faisal and the King of Iran to carry out the task of establishing an "Islamic Treaty."

    The joint communique issued after Faisal's visit to Iran stated that the two Kings unanimously agreed to initiate an Islamic summit, providing "an opportunity to discuss issues of concern to Islamic countries and to provide a starting point for them to achieve unity and protect their interests." Later, Faisal reiterated at a press conference in Amman in January that preparations for convening the Islamic summit were underway. He said that it had been decided in principle to establish an "Islamic Committee composed of several Islamic countries" to initiate the Islamic Conference.

    Cairo newspapers revealed that this planned treaty would include about a dozen Islamic countries from the Maghreb to the Arabian Gulf, including Bahrain, Qatar, and several small emirates in the Arabian Gulf. The planners of this treaty even intend to include "Malaysia" and others as possible future members.

    It is noteworthy that shortly after Faisal returned home from Tehran, he announced that Britain and the United States would provide Saudi Arabia with $300 million in air force weapons and equipment. In discussing the arms deal between Britain and the United States and Saudi Arabia last December, the Tunisian magazine *Jeune Afrique* said that this deal was related to King Faisal's visit to Iran and his request there to establish an "Islamic Front." Britain would not have provided Saudi Arabia with these weapons if it had not received assurances that these weapons would be used to establish a "East of Suez" force called the "Islamic Front." The newspaper also said that Washington's concern is to prevent any unexpected situations regarding the oil issue.

    All of these conspiracies cannot escape the vigilance of the Arab people regarding this treaty and have aroused their widespread protests.

    President Nasser of the UAR pointed out that the "Islamic Treaty" is the product of the policies of the United States and Britain, an imperialist conspiracy aimed at opposing the liberation movement, conspiring against the Arab people, and dragging them into the Western sphere of influence. The Arab people will overthrow the "Islamic Treaty" just as they overthrew the Baghdad Pact before.

    Syrian Prime Minister Zein said at a press conference on March 5 that Syria condemns all imperialist treaties, including the "Islamic Treaty." Syrian public opinion clearly stated that Syria opposes any conspiracy by imperialism to lure certain Arab countries to separate themselves from Arab unity.

    President Sallal of Yemen said on March 3 that all Arab people oppose the "Islamic Treaty." He emphasized the need to fight against imperialism, reactionary forces, and the planned "Islamic Treaty."

    President Arif of Iraq recently stated during a visit to the UAR, "We do not accept nor will we allow any treaty involving imperialism."

    Algerian Foreign Minister Bouteflika said on February 11: Algeria opposes conferences of Muslim leaders aimed at establishing new political organizations.

    The Kuwaiti Foreign Minister stated that Kuwait does not approve of participating in this treaty.

    Daoud Hussein, Executive Committee Member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said at a press conference in Algiers that the United States and Britain are the behind-the-scenes manipulators of this treaty. After the failure of the Baghdad Pact, these two countries are attempting to implement their aggressive policies through this treaty.

    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement on March 1 condemning the "Islamic Treaty" as a new conspiracy by imperialism to revive the Baghdad Pact. The statement pointed out that the purpose of this treaty is to unite all reactionary forces to stop the revolutionary tide in the Arab world.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 6th – According to reports in newspapers here, the UAR National Assembly on the 5th condemned imperialism for plotting an "Islamic Treaty" in the Middle East, attempting to serve imperialism, attack the Arab nationalist movement, and harm the Palestinian cause.

    The National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution stating that the Arab people will not be deceived by various slogans and will not allow imperialism or reactionaries to infiltrate their ranks. The Arab Affairs Committee of the National Assembly made a report on this issue before the resolution was passed, pointing out that the Arab people and the Islamic world have long suffered from imperialism, which arbitrarily divided the Arab world, issued the Balfour Declaration, and divided a part of Arabia.

    The report said that after rejecting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and all other imperialist treaties, the Arab nation remains firmly opposed to all alliances.

    UAR Prime Minister Mohieddin expressed the UAR government's agreement with the National Assembly's opinion after the parliamentary debate. He said that the Arab people can defeat treaties or any other imperialist conspiracies.

### 警惕美英帝国主义在中东的又一反革命阴谋

    警惕美英帝国主义在中东的又一反革命阴谋
    阿拉伯各国谴责美英策划建立“伊斯兰条约”集团镇压民族民主运动
    沙特阿拉伯伊朗两国国王公然发起召开伊斯兰首脑会议为美英效劳
    新华社开罗七日电　本社记者报道：去年年底以来，中东忽然出现了拼凑所谓“伊斯兰条约”的鬼鬼祟祟的活动。但是它刚一露头，真面目就被揭穿，阿拉伯各国人民群起愤怒声讨。
    阿拉伯舆论很快就指出，这个“条约”是美国和英国策划的、披上伊斯兰宗教外衣的一种军事和政治联盟，它的目的是要镇压这一地区的民族民主运动、分裂阿拉伯国家的队伍。
    美英帝国主义策划这个条约的消息，早在去年十二月在沙特阿拉伯国王费萨尔出访伊朗之前就开始透露出来了。西方报纸早在去年十二月就报道，华盛顿已经指使费萨尔国王和伊朗国王执行建立“伊斯兰条约”的任务。
    在费萨尔访问伊朗后发表的联合公报说，两国国王一致同意要发起召开伊斯兰首脑会议，提供“讨论伊斯兰国家所关心的问题的机会和提供使它们达到团结和保卫它们利益的起点”。后来费萨尔在一月在安曼举行的记者招待会上再次说，召开伊斯兰首脑会议的准备工作正在进行中。他说，原则上已经决定成立一个“由若干伊斯兰国家组成的伊斯兰委员会”来发起召开伊斯兰会议。
    开罗报纸透露，这个策划中的条约将包括从马格里布到阿拉伯湾的十来个伊斯兰国家，其中有巴林、卡塔尔和阿拉伯湾的几个小酋长国。这个条约的策划人甚至打算把“马来西亚”等也算作今后可能的成员。
    值得注意的是，在费萨尔从德黑兰回国后不久就宣布，英国和美国将给沙特阿拉伯三亿美元的空军武器和装备。突尼斯杂志《青年非洲》去年十二月在谈到英国和美国同沙特阿拉伯的军火交易时说，这笔交易同费萨尔国王访问伊朗和他在那里要求建立“伊斯兰阵线”有关。如果英国没有得到关于这些武器将用于建立一支名为“伊斯兰阵线”的“苏伊士以东”部队的保证，英国是不会向沙特阿拉伯提供这些武器的。报纸还说，华盛顿所关心的是，使石油问题不发生任何意外情况。
    这一切阴谋策划逃不过阿拉伯人民对这个条约的警惕，并且激起了他们普遍的抗议。
    阿联总统纳赛尔指出，“伊斯兰条约”是美英两国政策的产物，是一个帝国主义的阴谋，它的目的是同解放运动作对，阴谋反对阿拉伯人民，把他们拉进西方势力范围。阿拉伯人民将打倒“伊斯兰条约”，就象他们以前打倒巴格达条约一样。
    叙利亚总理扎因三月五日在记者招待会上说，叙利亚谴责包括“伊斯兰条约”在内的所有帝国主义条约。叙利亚舆论明白表示，叙利亚反对帝国主义引诱某些阿拉伯国家置身于阿拉伯团结之外的任何阴谋。
    也门总统萨拉勒三月三日说，所有的阿拉伯人民反对“伊斯兰条约”。他强调必须同帝国主义、反动势力和策划中的“伊斯兰条约”进行斗争。
    伊拉克总统阿里夫最近在访问阿联时说过，“我们不接受也不允许有帝国主义牵涉在里面的条约。”
    阿尔及利亚外交部长布特弗利卡二月十一日说：阿尔及利亚反对以建立新的政治组织为目标的穆斯林领导人会议。
    科威特外交大臣表示，科威特不赞成参加这个条约。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织执行委员达乌德·侯赛尼在阿尔及尔举行的记者招待会上说，美国和英国是这一条约的幕后操纵者。这两个国家在巴格达条约遭到失败之后，企图通过这一条约实行它们的侵略政策。
    亚非人民团结组织书记处三月一日发表声明，谴责“伊斯兰条约”是帝国主义企图使巴格达条约复活的一个新阴谋。声明指出，这个条约的目的是联合所有反动力量来阻止阿拉伯世界的革命潮流。
    新华社开罗六日电　据这里报纸报道，阿联国民议会五日谴责帝国主义在中东策划“伊斯兰条约”，企图为帝国主义效劳，打击阿拉伯民族主义运动和损害巴勒斯坦的事业。
    国民议会一致通过一项决议指出，阿拉伯人民不会受种种口号的欺骗，不让帝国主义或反动派渗透到他们的队伍中去。国民议会阿拉伯事务委员会在决议通过之前作了一项关于这一问题的报告指出，阿拉伯人民和伊斯兰世界早就遭受帝国主义之害，帝国主义任意分割阿拉伯世界，发表贝尔福宣言，把阿拉伯的一部分分割出去。
    报告说，阿拉伯民族在拒绝了“艾森豪威尔主义”和所有其它帝国主义条约之后，仍然坚决地反对所有的联盟。
    阿联总理毛希丁在议会辩论后表示阿联政府同议会的意见一致。他说，阿拉伯人民能够击败条约或其他任何帝国主义阴谋。
