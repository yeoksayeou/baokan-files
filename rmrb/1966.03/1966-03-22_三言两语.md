    Quick Comments
    Harming Others for Self-Interest
    It seems that the Johnson administration doesn't have many ways to deal with de Gaulle's challenges. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk had to put on the face of a benefactor and settle old scores. He said that the United States had "invested huge manpower and material resources" in the North Atlantic Group and that "since 1947, the U.S. defense budget alone has been about 850 billion U.S. dollars."
    What Rusk said is true, but he failed to explain why the United States has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on arms expansion and war preparations since the war, and why its "allies" should only be subject to its control forever. If Washington thinks it is actually doing a losing business, then doesn't it just show that the money the United States spends is just a self-serving investment that harms others?
    Hoist with Their Own Petard
    U.S. Under Secretary of State Ball, in response to France's request to withdraw from the military "integration" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said that "old nationalism has re-emerged in Western Europe, in which one country only cares about its own interests and does not care about what happens to other countries."
    In Western Europe, a "nationalism" that demands to get rid of being dominated is indeed rising. This "nationalism" is precisely caused by the United States' long-term policy of "only caring about its own interests and not caring about what happens to other countries" towards its Western European "allies." If France's actions are really as Ball said, it is nothing more than "treating others in the same way they treat you."
    Bringing Humiliation Upon Oneself
    U.S. Senator Fulbright, commenting on France's request to reorganize the North Atlantic Group, said: The view that the North Atlantic Group must be reorganized "may be correct. General de Gaulle's problem is that he makes suggestions in an offensive way. It seems to me that he often seems to intentionally insult people."
    Since de Gaulle's proposition is correct, how has it become "insulting"? Obviously, it is because the United States is accustomed to riding on the heads of its "partners" to issue orders and impose them on others. Therefore, whoever dares to disobey its will is considered rebellious and an "insult" to its "chieftain." But if this is called an "insult," then it is the United States who is bringing humiliation upon itself.

    三言两语
    损人利己
    看来，约翰逊政府对付戴高乐的挑战办法不多了。美国国务卿腊斯克只好摆出一副恩主的脸孔，算起老账来。他说，美国对北大西洋集团“投入了巨大的人力物力”，“一九四七年以来光是美国防务预算约为八千五百亿美元”。
    腊斯克说的都是实情，但是他没有能说明白，为什么美国战后以来花了几千亿美元进行扩军备战，美国的“盟国”就只应永远受它的控制。如果华盛顿认为它实际上是做了一桩亏本生意的话，那末不是正好说明美国所花的钱不过是一种损人利己的投资吗？
    自作自受
    美国副国务卿鲍尔针对法国要求退出北大西洋组织军事“一体化”说，在西欧“重新兴起了老的民族主义，在这种民族主义下，一国只顾自己的利益而不顾别国怎么样”。
    在西欧，的确正在兴起一种要求摆脱受人支配的“民族主义”。这种“民族主义”却正是由于美国长期对西欧“盟国”采取“只顾自己利益而不顾别国怎么样”的政策而引起来的。如果法国的做法真是鲍尔所说的那样，也不过是“以其人之道还治其人之身”罢了。
    自取其辱
    美国参议员富布赖特在评论法国要求改组北大西洋集团的做法时说：认为北大西洋集团必须改组的看法“可能是正确的。戴高乐将军的毛病是他以得罪人的方式提出意见。在我看来他常常好象是有意要侮辱人。”
    既然戴高乐的主张是正确的，怎么又成了“侮辱人”呢？显然是因为美国习惯于骑在“伙伴”头上发号施令，强加于人，因此，谁要是敢于违抗它的意旨，便被认为是大逆不道，是对它这个“盟主”的“侮辱”。但如说这是“侮辱”的话，那也是美国自取其辱罢了。
