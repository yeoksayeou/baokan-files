    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 19th - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio on the 18th: Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee and Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism of the National Union Government, sent an urgent telegram on March 16th to the two chairmen of the 1961-1962 Geneva Conference on Laos, condemning the United States and its lackeys for recently intensifying the bombing of central and lower Laos and spreading chemical toxins, and for intensifying deployments in all aspects in order to introduce US ground forces into Laos for direct combat.
    The telegram stated that in the past two months, the US aggressors have intensified the day and night bombing of various regions in central and lower Laos controlled by the Lao Patriotic Front with unprecedented brutality. According to incomplete statistics, in the past sixty days alone, US and its lackeys' jet aircraft and T-28 aircraft have carried out more than a thousand bombings in the aforementioned regions, committing heinous crimes.
    The telegram said that the most barbaric thing is that the US imperialists have deliberately and on a large scale intensified the use of chemical toxins as a means of warfare to massacre the people and destroy crops.
    The telegram said that while carrying out air raids on central and lower Laos, the US imperialists are actively implementing their plans to prepare conditions in all aspects for future military operations and the introduction of US ground forces to attack and occupy central and lower Laos. Now, hundreds of military advisors and technicians from the United States, South Vietnam, and Thailand are engaged in building military fortifications and expanding many airports.
    The telegram said that these crimes irrefutably prove the US imperialists' interference and aggression against Laos, further exposing their bellicose intentions and exposing all their ulterior slanders against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The telegram firmly demanded that the US aggressors and their lackeys immediately stop these crimes, abandon all conspiracies and acts of aggression against Laos, and especially abandon the plot to send US ground forces to occupy central and lower Laos. The telegram requested the two chairmen to notify the member states of the 1961-1962 Geneva Conference on Laos of the serious situation created by the US imperialists and their lackeys, and requested these countries to respect and strictly implement the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 19th - According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station: Under the cover of US aircraft, the Kong Le troops launched another large-scale attack on the Phou Kout Mountain area held by Lao patriotic armed forces on the 15th.
    The Lao patriotic armed forces held their positions and bravely resisted, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and damaging six US aircraft.
    On the 14th, US aircraft dispatched more than a hundred sorties to frantically bomb and strafe the Phou Kout Mountain area, paving the way for the Kong Le reactionary troops. However, under the heroic counterattack of the Lao patriotic armed forces who are determined to defend Phou Kout Mountain, the Kong Le reactionary troops failed to advance a single step.

    冯维希谴责美帝及其走狗加紧侵犯中下寮
    美机出动百多架次掩护贡勒部队进攻富科特山遭受重创未能得逞
    据新华社康开十九日电　据巴特寮电台十八日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希三月十六日打紧急电报给一九六一——一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议两主席，谴责美国及其走狗最近加紧轰炸中、下寮并撒放化学毒剂，在各方面加紧进行部署，以便把美国的地面部队引进老挝直接参战。
    电报说，在过去的两个月中，美国侵略者以史无前例的野蛮手段明显地加紧对老挝爱国战线党控制的中、下寮各个地区进行夜以继日的轰炸。据不完全统计，仅仅在过去的六十天中，美国及其走狗的喷气式飞机和T—28型飞机曾经对上述地区进行了一千多次轰炸，犯下了恶毒的罪行。
    电报说，最野蛮的是，美帝国主义者蓄意大规模地加紧使用化学毒剂作为战争手段来屠杀人民和毁坏庄稼。
    电报说，美帝国主义者在对中寮和下寮地区进行空袭的同时，正在积极实现他们的计划，以便在各方面为今后采取军事行动和引进美国地面部队来进攻和占领中寮和下寮准备条件。现在，数以百计的军事顾问和美国、南越以及泰国的技术人员正在从事于建筑军事工事和扩建许多机场。
    电报说，这些罪行无可争辩地证明了美帝国主义者对老挝的干涉和侵略，进一步暴露了他们的好战企图，揭穿了他们反对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国的一切别有用心的谰言。
    电报坚决要求美国侵略者及其走狗立即停止这种罪行、放弃一切反对老挝的阴谋和侵略行动、特别是放弃关于派遣美国地面部队来占领中、下寮地区的图谋。电报要求两主席把美帝国主义者及其走狗所制造的严重局势通知一九六一——一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议的成员国，并要求这些国家尊重和严格执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    新华社康开十九日电　据“老挝之声”电台广播：在美国飞机的掩护下，贡勒军队十五日又向富科特山地区的老挝爱国武装力量发起大规模进攻。
    老挝爱国武装力量坚守阵地，英勇阻击，使敌人遭到重创并且击伤美国飞机六架。
    十四日，美国飞机出动了一百多架次疯狂轰炸和扫射富科特山地区，为贡勒反动军队开路。但是，在决心保卫富科特山的老挝爱国武装力量的英勇反击下，贡勒反动军队未能前进一步。
