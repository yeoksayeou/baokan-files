    The Revolution in Soil and Water Conservation Work in Chengcheng County
    Two characteristics: short time, only three years to make a great change in the appearance of the Loess Plateau gully area; large area, the initially treated land has exceeded half of the total land area.
    The soil and water conservation work in Chengcheng County, Shaanxi Province, is attracting widespread attention from people in soil erosion areas of the Loess Plateau. There are two characteristics of Chengcheng's soil and water conservation work: one is the short time, only three years to make a great change in the appearance of the Loess Plateau gully area; the other is the large area, the total land area of the county is 1,110 square kilometers, and the area initially treated reaches 665 square kilometers. This is a revolution in soil and water conservation work.
    Entering the territory of Chengcheng County, people first see a magnificent picture of transforming nature: the Loess Plateau, which is divided by thousands of gullies, has terraced fields connecting to embankment fields from near to far, and embankment fields connecting to embankments. Along the edges of the gullies, sealing walls winding up and down, out of sight. Looking up from the bottom of the gully, the newly built dams and embankments are stacked on top of each other, like castles connected by countless barriers; looking down from a high place, the neat terraced fields and embankment fields are like green carpets, and the surrounding ridges and embankments are like carefully inlaid lace.
    In the past three years, Chengcheng County has treated more than 700,000 mu of cultivated land, making about 70% of the county's cultivated land initially control soil erosion. According to relevant departments, it can store an additional 15 million cubic meters of water and conserve 1.2 million cubic meters of soil every year. The county has only more than 90,000 male and female full and semi-laborers. In the past three years, more than 10 million workdays have been used for soil and water conservation, and more than 20 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. If all these earthworks are built into embankments one meter high and one meter wide, they can surround Chengcheng County more than a hundred times.
    The fruits of huge labor are that the total grain output of the county has increased significantly in the past three years: 48% in 1963 compared with 1962; 12.6% in 1964 compared with 1963; and 27% in 1965 compared with 1964. The grain yield per unit area has increased by nearly one time compared with the average of the fourteen years before soil and water conservation.
    In the past three years, Chengcheng has overfulfilled the state's grain purchase tasks every year, and the lives of commune members have also gradually improved.

          Grasp the Main Contradiction from Investigation and Research
    Chengcheng is located on the Weibei Plateau, bordering the Guanzhong Plain to the south. The county has an area of 1,110 square kilometers, and there are nearly a thousand deep gullies that can be named. Large gullies are ten to twenty li up and down, and general gullies are also two or three li. Thousands of gullies have divided the land into fragments. Of the county's more than one million mu of cultivated land, half is gully slope land, and half is undulating, steep, original land. The Loess Plateau has strong winds and little rain, and the climate is dry, but the very precious rainwater flows away along the gully slopes, causing the county's grain output to be low and unstable for a long time. From the liberation in 1949 to 1962, there were three bumper years, four lean years, and seven average years. The average grain yield per mu in fourteen years was only more than 110 jin.
    Necessity spurs change. A revolution in thought and production is brewing.
    In 1962, Chengcheng County launched a county-wide discussion on whether grain and cotton production could be increased.
    Some people say that to increase production, the area of irrigated land must be expanded. However, there are only five small rivers in Chengcheng, with a total flow of less than one cubic meter per second. Where does the water come from to greatly expand irrigated land? Some people suggested drawing water from the Luo River in the west of the county, and some proposed digging deep wells to develop groundwater. However, whether it is river water or well water, it requires a lot of funds and technical equipment to pump it to the Loess Plateau more than 100 meters high. Most cadres and commune members believe that this road is not feasible for the time being.
    Some people say that livestock and fertilizer are very important for increasing production. At that time, the county had only more than 20,000 draft animals, with an average of more than 50 mu of cultivated land per animal. With weak animal power, it is impossible to cultivate deeply and meticulously; with few animals, there is naturally little fertilizer. It seems to be a real problem. This year, county and commune leaders personally stayed in breeding rooms to feed livestock, and the situation of fewer and weaker draft animals in the county quickly improved, and fertilizer also increased. However, the situation of low grain yield has not changed much.
    The Chengcheng County Party Committee decided that leading cadres should go down to investigate in person. The county party secretary, county party committee members, the county head, and the director of the agricultural and animal husbandry bureau all went to the countryside to investigate and research. One situation caught their attention: whether on the original land, slopes, or at the bottom of gullies, there were a few production teams that, although their natural conditions were not good and they also lacked draft animals and fertilizer, built embankments in some of their cultivated land and leveled the land. As a result, the loss of water, soil, and fertilizer was relatively small, and the grain yield was 20% to 30% higher than that of teams with the same conditions around them. In years with severe droughts and floods, the yield was relatively stable. Local people have this experience: "Picking up manure is not as good as lining the pen, lining the pen is not as good as building embankments"; "If slope land is not built with embankments, three mu can only be planted as two and a half mu."
    The Chengcheng County Party Committee finally found the main contradiction in developing agricultural production: drought and severe soil erosion. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction centered on controlling soil erosion, store all the limited rainwater in the fields, and protect the fertilizer and topsoil from being lost with the water to change the low-yield and backward appearance. That is to say, it is necessary to transform more than one million mu of undulating and fragmented original land, slope land, and gully land into level fields with embankments and ridges, and gradually green the barren gullies and slopes.

          Start from the Revolutionization of Leadership
    Discovering the problem does not mean solving it. At that time, some cadres had many concerns about carrying out soil and water conservation work and lacked confidence. Some people said that soil and water conservation is not new in Chengcheng. Since the cooperativization, many teams have been doing it every year, but they have not achieved anything. Some people said that some communes and teams had also worked hard for a while in the past, but later suffered natural disasters and could not persist, wasting a lot of labor.
    The county party committee also conducted investigations and research on different types of areas that had carried out soil and water conservation, and specifically summarized their successful experiences and lessons from failure in carrying out soil and water conservation in different periods. It was found that the teams that succeeded in maintaining soil and water had one thing in common, that is, the cadres and the masses had an ambition to change the world, actively created conditions according to the established goals, and launched an attack on nature, cutting slopes, building embankments, filling gullies, and building dams, persisting unremittingly, and finally achieved results and changed the appearance; while the failed teams, in addition to improper methods and measures, lacked lofty ideals and only passively defended against the harm of soil erosion, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Therefore, they treated it every year, and lost it every year. The same is soil and water conservation. Due to the different mental states of the leaders, some teams succeeded and increased production; some teams failed, did not increase production, and even reduced production. This matter gave the county party committee leading cadres an enlightenment: to revolutionize production, the leadership's thinking must be revolutionized first. Without revolutionary leadership, there would be no revolutionary mass movement.
    Therefore, the county party committee led the county's cadres, held meetings to study the revolutionization of leadership thinking and the problem of changing the backward appearance of production, and organized cadres to review Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" and other works to improve understanding and unify thinking. After repeated discussions, everyone agreed that soil and water conservation is the fundamental way to develop agricultural production in the Loess Plateau gully area. In the past, a few teams did well, and most teams did not do well, mainly because the county party committee's leading ideology had not yet been revolutionized. For example, some people believe that Chengcheng has an average of five mu of land per person, and although the yield per mu is not high, the total output is quite a lot; in times of good weather, they are content with the status quo and do nothing, and when natural disasters are serious, they only care about the immediate and lose sight of the long-term, lacking revolutionary ambition, which makes the county's soil and water conservation work in a state of piecemeal work for a long time. Some people attribute this situation in the past to: being accustomed to low yields and used to fighting passive battles.
    After fully exposing contradictions and launching ideological struggles, starting from the summer of 1963, the county party committee led the people of the county to carry out a mass movement of farmland capital construction centered on controlling soil erosion, thoroughly changing the backward production appearance of the plateau gully area.
    The county party committee transferred a large number of cadres from the leading organs to the communes to take on leadership work and strengthen the leadership of grassroots work. Leading cadres of the county party committee took the lead in staying in backward teams, and they chose Zhengjiapo, Dongwupo and other production teams with relatively poor working foundations and more arduous soil and water conservation projects as the first batch of soil and water conservation models in the county. Of the seventeen communes in the county, eleven county-level leading cadres, fourteen commune party committee secretaries, and fifteen commune directors have learned the techniques of soil and water conservation such as building embankments and ridges, and ordinary cadres have also generally changed from laymen to experts. This has greatly promoted the development of the soil and water conservation movement throughout the county.

          Let the Masses Be the Masters of Nature
    Farmland capital construction centered on soil and water conservation requires the broadest mobilization of the masses to participate. How to turn the ideas of the leaders into the actions of the masses, the key lies in highlighting politics and arming the minds of cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The facts in Chengcheng prove that once Chairman Mao's brilliant thought is grasped by the broad masses, the consciousness and enthusiasm of commune members to carry out soil and water conservation will be greatly developed and become a huge material force.
    In the beginning, although many commune members in many places had an urgent desire to prevent and control soil erosion, they lacked confidence in changing the natural appearance by relying on their own strength. Some people said: Chengcheng County has thousands of gullies, and relying on a shovel to throw dirt, how long will it take? Some people said: Generations have not achieved anything, it's useless. The county party committee believes that if this idea of not believing in one's own strength is not broken, the masses cannot be the masters of nature. Since 1963, the county party committee has organized the study of Chairman Mao's articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" among commune and team cadres and commune members to liberate people's minds; and the leading cadres of the county party committee personally participated in cultivating models to educate the masses with facts. The Dongwupo Production Team of the Wujiapo Brigade of the Siqian Commune is a famous poor team. After studying, the commune members' understanding has been improved. They said: The slope is dead, and people are alive. It can only be people managing the land, and not letting the land control people; although the difficulties are great, the more you don't do it, the greater it will be. They overcame various difficulties and built more than 900 mu of land with embankments and ridges in two years, and the grain yield increased by 70%.
    In the process of treatment, some cadres and the masses did not have enough understanding of the significance of soil and water conservation. Some people only sought immediate results, only engaged in temporary measures, and did not repair permanent projects; some people had a fluke mentality when the weather was good and the work stopped; people on the original land believed that their cultivated land was relatively flat, and it didn't matter much if they didn't treat it; the teams at the bottom of the gully were worried that the original land would not be treated, and they would not be able to treat it well, so they were reluctant to act. The remnants of the small-scale peasant economy and the old habits have made some people have not fundamentally changed their determination to change the situation of soil erosion. The party branches of various teams organized poor and lower-middle peasant commune members to recall the bitterness and think about the sweetness, to talk about the suffering of soil erosion, and to talk about the interests of the country, the collective, and the individual, so that everyone linked the control of soil erosion to not transporting sediment to the Yellow River, linked the current increase in production to building a new socialist countryside, and linked the local development of soil and water conservation to the revolutionary interests of the people of the country, which greatly inspired the masses' consciousness in controlling soil erosion.

  Act as a Calm Revolutionary Promotive Force
    In leading the people of the county to carry out the soil and water conservation movement, the Chengcheng County Party Committee not only actively educated the masses to improve their consciousness, but also was good at patiently waiting to promote the healthy development of the movement. In the winter of 1963, when the county party committee was cultivating the Shuikou Brigade of the Wangzhuang Commune as a model for the treatment of original land, some cadres believed that this brigade had a lot of original land and the amount of work was relatively small, and it should be completed in two or three years as soon as possible. However, the commune members did not have confidence for a while, and they formulated a long-term plan to complete the initial treatment in eight years. After discovering this situation, the leading cadres of the county party committee believed that the important thing was not the plan, but that the masses' awareness of controlling soil erosion was not high, and they should improve their understanding from practice while strengthening ideological education. So they agreed to this plan. In the actual treatment process, the progress of the project greatly exceeded the original plan. In the spring of 1964, the commune members themselves revised the plan to complete the treatment in five years. They fought an annihilation battle in the summer and revised it again to three years. By winter, 6,000 mu of the brigade's 6,800 mu of cultivated land had been initially treated, and it took only a little more than a year in total.
    Then they immediately turned to comprehensive, high-standard, and high-quality treatment, always staying ahead and playing a model role. In the process of promoting advanced experience, the Chengcheng County Party Committee held many on-site meetings, repeatedly organized cadres and commune members to visit, compare, and evaluate, so that the masses could appraise, learn, improve, and promote themselves, and the masses could make their own decisions instead of letting the leading cadres make decisions for the masses. As a result, the soil and water conservation movement was carried out faster rather than slower, and the quality of the project was higher rather than lower.
    When the masses' enthusiasm for controlling soil erosion was high, the Chengcheng County Party Committee emphasized that everything should proceed from reality and correctly handle the relationship between carrying out soil and water conservation and doing a good job in the current production, the relationship between farmland capital construction and fertilizers, seeds and other yield-increasing measures, and the relationship between the speed and quality of soil and water conservation projects. The county party committee clearly stated that soil and water conservation work should start from production and serve production. All communes and teams put the current production in the first place, comprehensively arranged labor and planting plans, so that the professional soil and water conservation team remained at about 10% of the total labor force, and the annual investment in farmland capital construction remained at about 20% of the total agricultural investment. At the same time, try to use the winter slack season and the gap between summer farm work to mobilize more labor to concentrate on fighting annihilation battles. In this way, it will not delay the current production and speed up the treatment progress. In the relationship between good and fast, emphasize seeking fast in good and quality first. In the work of cultivating models, attention was also paid to cultivating models of different treatment measures such as embankment building with rammed earth, embankment building with shovels, filling gullies and building dams, repairing terraced fields, and afforestation and planting grass in different types of areas, and promoting them throughout the county according to local conditions. Make the soil and water conservation movement both vigorous and down-to-earth.

    澄城县水土保持工作的革命
    两个特点：时间短，只用了三年时间，就使黄土高原沟壑区的面貌有了很大变化；面积大，初步治理的土地已超过土地总面积的一半。
    陕西省澄城县的水土保持工作，正在引起黄土高原水土流失地区人们的广泛注意。澄城治理水土的工作有两个特点：一是时间短，只用了三年时间，就使黄土高原沟壑区的面貌有了很大的变化；二是面积大，全县土地总面积一千一百一十平方公里，初步治理的面积达到六百六十五平方公里。这是水土保持工作上的革命。
    人们进入澄城县境，首先看到的是一幅改造大自然的宏伟图画：被千沟万壑割裂的黄土高原，由近而远，坝地连着梯田，梯田接着埝地，沟壑边沿，封沟墙蜿蜒上下，一眼望不到头。站在沟底往上看，新修的坝、埝重重叠叠，象是无数壁垒相连的城堡；站在高处往下看，整齐的梯田、埝地，又象是片片绿色地毯，四周的埂、埝仿佛是精心镶嵌的花边。
    三年来，澄城县共治理耕地七十多万亩，使全县约百分之七十的耕地初步控制了水土流失。据有关部门推算，每年可多蓄水一千五百万立方米，保土一百二十万立方米。全县男女全半劳力只有九万多个，三年来用于水土保持的工日达一千多万个，完成土方工程二千多万立方米。如果把这些土方全部修筑成一米高、一米宽的地埂，可以围绕澄城县四周一百多圈。
    巨大劳动获得的果实是，三年来全县粮食总产量大幅度上升：一九六三年比一九六二年增长百分之四十八；一九六四年比一九六三年增长百分之十二点六；一九六五年又比一九六四年增长百分之二十七。粮食的单位面积产量比治理水土以前的十四年的平均数，增加了将近一倍。
    三年来，澄城年年超额完成国家的粮食征购任务，社员群众的生活也逐步有所改善。
          从调查研究中抓主要矛盾
    澄城地处渭北高原，南临关中平原。全县一千一百一十平方公里面积，叫得上名字的深沟就将近一千条。大沟一上一下有一二十里，一般的沟也有二、三里。千沟万壑把土地割裂得支离破碎。全县一百多万亩耕地，一半是沟坡地，一半是起伏不平坡度较大的原地。黄土高原风多雨少，气候干旱，而十分宝贵的雨水却顺着沟坡流失，使全县粮食产量长期低且不稳。从一九四九年解放以后到一九六二年，三丰，四歉，七个平年，十四年平均，粮食单产只有一百一十多斤。
    穷则思变。一场思想上和生产上的革命在酝酿中。
    一九六二年，澄城县在全县范围内开展了一场粮棉能不能增产的大讨论。
    有人说，要增产就得扩大水浇地面积。但是澄城境内只有五条小河，总流量不到一个秒立方米。大量扩大水浇地，水从那里来？有人建议从县西的洛河抽水，有人提议打深井开发地下水。但是，无论是河水或是井水，要抽上一百多米的黄土高原，都需要大量资金和技术设备。大多数干部和社员认为这条路暂时行不通。
    有人说，要增产，牲畜和肥料很重要。当时，全县只有两万多头耕畜，平均每头负担耕地五十多亩。畜力弱，不能深耕细作；畜少，肥料自然也少。看来确实是个问题。这一年，县、社领导干部亲自住饲养室，喂牲畜，全县耕畜少和弱的情况很快有了好转，肥料也增多了。然而粮食低产的情况并没有多大的改变。
    中共澄城县委决定领导干部亲自下去调查。县委书记、县委委员、县长和农牧局长都下乡调查研究。有一个情况引起了他们的注意：无论在原上、坡上或沟下，都有少数生产队虽然自然条件也不好，同样也缺少耕畜和肥料，但他们在一部分耕地里修筑了埝埂，平整了土地，于是水、土和肥料流失得比较少，粮食产量比周围同样条件的队就高出二三成，在旱涝灾害严重的年头，产量也比较稳定。当地群众都有这样的经验：“拾粪不如垫圈，垫圈不如修埝”；“坡地不修埝，三亩种成二亩半”。
    澄城县委终于找到了发展农业生产的主要矛盾：干旱和严重的水土流失。要解决这个矛盾，只有大规模地开展以治理水土流失为中心的农田基本建设，把有限的雨水全部蓄在田里，把肥料和活土层保护住不让随水流失，才能改变低产落后的面貌。也就是说，需要把一百多万亩起伏不平、支离破碎的原地、坡地、沟地，修成有埝有埂的水平田，把荒沟荒坡逐步绿化。
          从领导革命化开始
    发现了问题并不等于解决了问题。当时，一部分干部对开展水土保持工作顾虑重重，信心不足。有人说，水土保持在澄城不是新鲜事，自从合作化以后，不少队年年搞，也没搞出个名堂。有人说，有些社队过去也大干过一阵，以后遭到自然灾害，就不能坚持下来，浪费了不少劳动力。
    县委又对过去搞过水土保持的不同类型地区进行调查研究，具体总结他们在不同时期开展水土保持的成功经验和失败教训。发现保持水土成功的队有一个共同之点，就是干部和群众都有一个改天换地的雄心壮志，按照既定目标，积极创造条件，向大自然展开进攻，斩坡、帮埝、填沟、打坝，坚持不懈，终于获得成效，改变了面貌；而失败的队除了方法、措施不当以外，都是缺乏远大理想，对水土流失的祸害只是消极防御，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，因而年年治理，年年流失。同样是水土保持，由于领导精神状态不同，有的队成功了，增了产；有的队却失败了，不增产，甚至减了产。这件事给县委领导干部一个启发，要生产上革命，领导思想就得先革命。没有革命化的领导，就没有革命的群众运动。
    于是，县委领导全县干部，开会研究领导思想上革命化和改变落后的生产面貌问题，组织干部重温毛主席的《愚公移山》、《关于农业合作化问题》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》等著作，提高认识，统一思想。经过反复讨论，大家一致认为水土保持是黄土高原沟壑区发展农业生产的根本道路。过去少数队搞得好，多数队没有搞好，主要是县委领导思想还没有革命化。例如，有人认为澄城平均每人五亩地，单产虽不高，总产却不少；在风调雨顺的时候，安于现状，无所作为，当自然灾害严重的时候，又只顾眼前，丢了长远，缺乏革命的雄心壮志，使全县的水土保持工作，长期处于零敲碎打的状态。有人把过去这种情况，归结为：习惯了低产量，打惯了被动仗。
    经过充分揭露矛盾，展开思想斗争，从一九六三年夏天开始，县委领导全县人民，开展一个以治理水土流失为中心的农田基本建设的群众运动，彻底改变高原沟壑区生产落后的面貌。
    县委从领导机关中抽调大批干部，下放到公社担任领导工作，加强基层工作的领导。县委领导干部带头到落后队蹲点，他们选择工作基础比较差而水土保持工程又比较艰巨的郑家坡、东吴坡等生产队，作为全县第一批水土保持样板。全县十七个公社，现在已经有十一名县级领导干部和十四名公社党委书记、十五名社长学会了帮埝、筑埂等治理水土流失的技术，一般干部也普遍由外行变成了内行。这就大大地促进了全县水土保持运动的发展。
          让群众作大自然的主人
    以水土保持为中心的农田基本建设，需要最广泛地动员群众参加。如何把领导的思想，变为群众的行动，关键在于突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众的头脑。澄城的事实证明，毛主席的光辉思想一经为广大群众所掌握，社员们开展水土保持的自觉性和积极性就会极大地发扬，成为巨大的物质力量。
    开始的时候，不少地方的社员虽然有着防治水土流失的迫切愿望，但是对于凭仗自己力量改变自然面貌还缺乏信心。有人说：澄城县千沟万壑，就凭一锨一锨撂土，要撂到何年何月？有人说：祖祖辈辈都没治出个名堂，不顶事。县委认为，不破除这种不相信自己力量的思想，群众就不能做大自然的主人。从一九六三年以来，县委就在社队干部和社员中间，组织学习毛主席的《愚公移山》等文章，解放人们的思想；并由县委领导干部亲自参加培养样板，用事实教育群众。寺前公社吴家坡大队东吴坡生产队是有名的穷队。经过学习以后，社员的认识提高了，他们说：坡是死的，人是活的，只能人治地，不能叫地制了人；困难虽大，越不干就越大。他们克服种种困难，两年就修成了有埝有埂的地九百多亩，粮食产量增加了七成。
    在治理过程中，还有一部分干部和群众对水土保持的意义认识不足，有的人只图当年见效，只搞临时措施，不修永久性工程；有人在风调雨顺的时候，就抱着侥幸心理，治理工作停顿下来；原上的人认为自己的耕地地势较平，治不治问题不大；沟底的队又担心原上不治，自己也治不好，迟迟不愿行动。小农经济的思想残余和旧的习惯势力，使一部分人还没有从根本上改变水土流失状况的决心。各队党支部就组织贫农下中农社员忆苦思甜，大诉水土流失的苦，大讲国家、集体和个人的利害关系，从而使大家把治理水土流失和不向黄河输送泥沙联系起来，把当前增产和建设社会主义新农村联系起来，把当地开展水土保持同全国人民的革命利益联系起来，大大启发了群众在治理水土流失中的自觉性。
  作冷静的革命促进派
    澄城县委在领导全县人民进行水土保持运动中，既积极教育群众提高觉悟，又善于耐心等待，促使运动健康地发展。一九六三年冬，县委在培养王庄公社水洼大队作为治理原地样板时，有的干部认为，这个大队原地多，工程量比较小，应该尽快在两三年内治完。但是社员一时还没有信心，订出一个八年完成初步治理的长远规划。县委领导干部发现这个情况以后，认为重要的不是规划，而是群众治理水土流失的自觉性还不高，应该在加强思想教育的同时，让社员从实践当中提高认识，于是就同意了这个规划。在实际治理过程中，工程进度大大超过了原来计划。一九六四年春，社员自己修改规划为五年治完。夏季打了一个歼灭战，又修改为三年。到冬季，全大队六千八百亩耕地已经初步治完六千亩，总共只用了一年多一点时间。
    接着他们就立即转入全面高标准高质量治理，始终走在前头，发挥了样板作用。在推广先进经验的过程中，澄城县委多次召开现场会，反复组织干部和社员参观、评比，让群众自己鉴定、学习、提高、推广，由群众自己下决心，而不由领导干部代替群众下决心。结果，水土保持运动开展得更快而不是慢，工程质量更高而不是低。
    当群众治理水土流失的热情高涨起来以后，澄城县委又强调一切从实际出发，正确处理开展水土保持与搞好当年生产的关系，农田基本建设与肥料种子及其它增产措施的关系，水土保持工程快和好的关系。县委明确提出：水土保持工作从生产出发，为生产服务。各社队都把当前生产列为第一位，全面安排劳力和种植计划，使水土保持专业队伍保持在总劳力的百分之十左右，全年农田基本建设投工保持在农业总投工的百分之二十左右。同时，尽量利用冬闲和夏季农忙间隙，动员较多劳力集中力量打歼灭战。这样，既不耽误当年生产，又加快了治理进度。在好与快的关系上，强调好中求快，质量第一。在培养样板工作中，也注意在不同类型地区，培养了椽帮埝、锨拍埝、填沟打坝、修梯田、造林种草等不同治理措施的样板，在全县因地制宜地推广。使水土保持运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
