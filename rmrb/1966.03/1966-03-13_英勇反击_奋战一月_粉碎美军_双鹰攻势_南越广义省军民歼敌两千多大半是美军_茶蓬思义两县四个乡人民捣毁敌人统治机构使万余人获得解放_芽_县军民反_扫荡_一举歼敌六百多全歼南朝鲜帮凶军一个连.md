    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam achieved brilliant results in the battles against the so-called "Operation Double Eagle" by the US puppet troops from January 27 to February 27, annihilating a total of 2,039 enemies, including 1,266 US aggressors killed or wounded, completely wiping out one US company, one puppet battalion, and four puppet companies, and shooting down 44 US aircraft.
    During this large-scale "sweep," the enemy mobilized over 10,000 troops, including 8,000 US soldiers, and launched an offensive against various counties in southern Quang Ngai Province under the cover of hundreds of aircraft and armored vehicles. The army and people of Quang Ngai Province, carrying forward the tradition of heroic combat, brought into play the superiority of people's war in the counter-"sweep" battles, closely cooperating with each other, not only thwarting the "sweep" by the US aggressors and their puppet troops but also actively attacking enemy strongholds and ambushing the enemy on major transportation lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. According to incomplete statistics, in the month from January 27 to February 27, the army and people of Quang Ngai Province annihilated a total of 2,039 enemy troops, including 1,266 US aggressors killed or wounded, and killed the puppet county chiefs of Duc Pho and Mo Duc counties; completely wiped out one US company, one puppet battalion, and four puppet security and commando companies, shot down 44 US aircraft, destroyed two M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, and seized more than 150 various weapons, including one mortar and 15 machine guns.
    At the same time, the people of four communes in Tra Bong and Tu Nghia counties in this province also rose up to demolish the enemy's ruling organizations, liberating more than 12,000 compatriots.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Mo Duc County near Saigon in South Vietnam killed and wounded 658 enemies in the counter-"sweep" battle on February 27, completely wiping out a company of South Korean mercenaries.
    On this day, the US aggressors mobilized more than 3,000 enemy troops, including two battalions of South Korean mercenaries, to conduct a "sweep" in Quy Duc commune, Mo Duc County. The Liberation Armed Forces fighters, who were waiting in battle formation, calmly fought back. When the enemy approached the position, they immediately launched a fierce attack, and charged forward to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, leaving the enemy dizzy and corpses strewn across the field. At the same time, the fighters also braved the enemy's artillery fire and went straight to the enemy's forward command post, completely wiping out a company of South Korean mercenaries. Under the heroic counterattack of the Liberation Armed Forces, the enemy's "sweep" was quickly thwarted.
    According to preliminary statistics, in this fierce counter-"sweep" battle, the army and people of Mo Duc County annihilated a total of 658 enemy troops, including 458 killed and 200 wounded, completely wiping out a company of South Korean mercenaries. Among the enemy killed, there were three US military commanders, one puppet army major, and five captains.

    敌人在这次大规模“扫荡”中，共出动了包括八千名美军在内的一万多兵力，在成百架飞机和装甲车掩护下，向广义省南部各县发动进攻。广义省军民发扬英勇战斗的传统，在反“扫荡”的战斗中，发挥人民战争的优越性，互相紧密配合，不仅挫败了美国侵略军及其仆从军的“扫荡”，而且还主动袭击敌人的据点，并在主要交通线上狙击敌人，使敌人遭到惨重伤亡。据不完全统计，从一月二十七日到二月二十七日的一个月中，广义省军民共歼灭敌军两千零三十九名，其中打死、打伤美国侵略军一千二百六十六名，并打死了德普、慕德两个县的伪县长；全歼美军一个连、伪军一个营和伪保安队、别动队四个连，击落美国飞机四十四架，击毁M—113型两栖装甲车两辆，缴获各种武器一百五十多件，其中有迫击炮一门、机枪十五挺。
