    Long-Term Participation in Rural Grassroots Health Construction Work
    More Than 500 Medical Personnel in Hubei Settle in Rural Areas
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan) More than 500 medical personnel in Hubei Province who have settled down in rural areas to participate in grassroots health construction work on a long-term basis have successively taken up their work posts. Many are actively engaged in disease prevention and treatment.
    More than half of these medical personnel previously worked in hospitals at the prefecture and city levels or above. They included backbone forces such as hospital directors, department heads, attending physicians, and professors and lecturers from medical colleges. After arriving in rural areas, in addition to personnel from Wuhan Medical College and Hubei Medical College preparing to establish branch schools in Yunyang and Xianning prefectures respectively to cultivate specialized medical and health personnel for the countryside, the others were assigned to areas lacking doctors and medicine. Some strengthened the district and commune health centers, while others established regional hospitals in districts and communes. The eighteen medical personnel who arrived in the Wuduhe mountain area of Yichang have, in the past two months, built a regional hospital in a simple and crude manner, cured forty-three patients, and performed more than thirty operations for farmers, deeply welcomed by the farmers.

    长期参加农村基层卫生建设工作
    湖北五百多名医务人员落户农村
    据新华社武汉电  湖北省到农村安家落户长期参加基层卫生建设的五百多名医务人员，已经陆续走上工作岗位。许多人正在积极投入防病治病工作。
    这批医务人员中有一半以上过去是在专区和市以上的医院工作的。其中包括院长、科主任、主治医师和医学院校的教授和讲师等骨干力量。他们到达农村后，除武汉医学院、湖北医学院的人员分别在郧阳、咸宁两个专区筹办分校，为农村培养专科医药卫生人材外，其他人都分配到缺医少药的地区，有的充实和加强区、公社卫生院，有的到区、公社建立地区医院。到达宜昌雾渡河山区的十八名医务人员，两个月来已因陋就简地建成一所地区医院，治好了四十三个病人，还给农民做了三十多次手术，深受农民欢迎。
