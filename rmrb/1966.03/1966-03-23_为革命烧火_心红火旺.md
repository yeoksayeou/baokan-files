    Burning Fire for Revolution, Hearts Red and Flames High
    Zhang Daolu, Cook Squad Leader, a Certain Unit of the PLA's Third Company

    Speaking of stoking a fire, it seems very simple, but in reality, it's not; there's a lot of knowledge inside. Two years of practice have taught me: Only by arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought and establishing the idea of wholeheartedly serving the revolution can we burn the revolutionary fire brightly, save more coal, and promote the development of the revolutionary cause; otherwise, the fire won't burn well, the food won't be cooked well, and coal will be wasted.
  Different Classes Have Different Understandings of "Success"

    In August 1963, I was conscripted into the army. At that time, I thought: I'm a junior high school graduate, if the superiors ask me to do technical work, that would be ideal. In my opinion, doing technical work would be impressive in the army, and I could find a good job when I returned to the local area, truly "glamorous" and with "prospects." Unexpectedly, the leadership sent me to the cook squad. I thought to myself: "After studying for eight or nine years, I'm not learning technology but wielding a fire shovel; isn't this like using a cannon to shoot mosquitoes?" The more I thought about it, the more I felt being a "cook" had no "prospects."

    Once, I went to the health team for treatment. The medic said to me, "Little Zhang, you smell of cooking oil; have you been improving your living standards?" This was originally an unintentional remark, but upon hearing it, it felt like adding fuel to the fire. When I went back, I said, "As soon as we go out, people know what we do, what's glorious about it! What prospects! I don't want to continue doing this." But then I thought, I'm a new recruit, the future is long, it wouldn't be good for me to continue like this. Then I thought: They probably won't ask me to do this job for the rest of my life, right? So, I reluctantly continued. If individualistic calculations aren't completely discarded, how can one have the heart to do a good job! When stoking the fire, although I held the coal shovel and stood in front of the stove busily, I was actually distracted and careless. Every day, I had to burn one or two hundred catties of coal, but the food still wasn't cooked well, the diet wasn't improved, and everyone had a lot of complaints.

    Later, the instructor took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with me, advising me to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the word "apply," and constantly transform my non-proletarian thoughts, establishing the idea of wholeheartedly engaging in revolution. So, I studied "Serve the People." I thought: Why did Comrade Zhang Side love the charcoal-burning work, even sacrificing his most precious life in the end? How did he understand "success," and how did he treat it? And why did Chairman Mao write an article praising his death for the people's interests as "heavier than Mount Tai?" Thinking of this, I also thought of Comrade Lei Feng. Why was he willing to be a revolutionary "screw" in an ordinary work position, making extraordinary contributions to the revolution? And why did Chairman Mao personally inscribe the words, calling on the people of the whole country to "learn from Comrade Lei Feng?" Carrying this question, I also carefully studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." After repeated consideration and the help of comrades, I clearly realized: The so-called "success" has different understandings for different classes. In the eyes of the exploiting classes, individualism comes first, oppressing others, harming others to benefit oneself, and pursuing personal fame, status, and material enjoyment everywhere; this is their greatest "success." However, proletarian revolutionaries are the opposite; they have lofty revolutionary ideals, always thinking of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and regard wholeheartedly serving the people as their greatest success. Comrade Zhang Side was precisely the latter type of person, so his death was "heavier than Mount Tai," and Comrade Lei Feng was also such a person, so he became a great communist fighter. I am a revolutionary youth; after coming to the army, the superiors asked me to be a cook, how could I think that it was "underutilizing talent" and had no "prospects"? All work is for the revolution, and stoking the fire and cooking is also a part of revolutionary work; how can revolutionary work have no prospects? Burning the fire well, cooking the food well, making comrades healthy and full of energy, practicing the skills to kill the enemy, defending socialist construction, and defending world peace, isn't this the greatest success, the greatest glory of stoking the fire? After such a comparison and examination, I realized that whether a job has prospects or not, there is a class standpoint issue here. Serving the people means having prospects, planning for oneself means having no prospects. In the past, I thought that cooking work had no prospects because my own thinking had no prospects. The reason was that I had individualistic selfishness in my thinking and had not yet established a revolutionary worldview. Thus, I felt that to be a good cook for the revolution, I must often creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly transform my worldview, and eliminate selfishness. Only in this way can I hold the coal shovel well for the revolution and stoke the fire well for the revolution.

      Stoking the Fire Depends on Thought; a Red Heart Makes the Flames Burn Brightly

    To stoke the fire well for the revolution, we must wage a firm struggle against all kinds of selfishness. When people's subjective factors are brought into play, they can better master the technology and make the fire burn brightly.

    At the end of February last year, in order to save more coal for the country, the leadership asked us to switch to using double-eye return air stoves and pointed out: This is a revolution in the kitchen. However, I couldn't figure it out. I thought: Saving coal must also be done while cooking good food; can't such a big country afford to burn coal for a company? With this idea, the first time I used the new stove to cook, I lit the fire, added coal, and the smoke was trapped in the stove, and the flames didn't rise. I got angry and stabbed at it fiercely, but the more I stabbed, the less it burned, and I only saw crushed coal leaking down. As a result, the snow-white rice turned into yellow rice. In the following days, the food we cooked was either undercooked or had a smoky smell, and everyone had a lot of complaints. I felt even more frustrated and complained, "It's so much easier to cook with a blower! Throw in a few shovels of coal and don't care about it; why not do the easy work and look for trouble!" Some people in the squad also felt that it was a thankless task and complained that we shouldn't have changed the stove.

    At this time, the instructor helped us study the situation. He pointed out: The fire doesn't burn, and the food isn't cooked well, not because the new stove is not as good as the old stove, but mainly because there are still too many old-fashioned ideas in our minds, too little of the word "revolution," we haven't mastered the characteristics of the new stove, and subjectively, we are not actively practicing. He also told us to study Chairman Mao's discourse on the relationship between people and weapons well, break down conservative thinking, and establish a spirit of daring to make revolution. I thought about it carefully, that's right! So, I studied Chairman Mao's works according to the instructor's instructions. I thought that Chairman Mao emphasized that the people who play a decisive role in war should be those with a high degree of class consciousness, extremely responsible for the revolutionary cause, and able to exert subjective initiative. Similarly, only such people can improve the stove and also master its characteristics, master new stoking methods, make the fire burn brightly, and cook the food well. Thinking this way, I also had confidence and dared to innovate. So, I and everyone else worked hard to study and explore, modified the hearth nineteen times over fifteen days, and finally figured out the characteristics of the new stove. From then on, stoking the double-eye return air stove became easier, reducing the coal consumption from an average of more than two catties per person per day to about one catty.

    Of course, ideological transformation is not a one-time thing. In the process of stoking the double-eye return air stove, we must constantly overcome the thought of seeking ease. Once, my arthritis flared up again, and I found it difficult to walk. In order to get some rest for myself, when stoking the fire, I didn't spread the coal evenly into the hearth as before but added more at a time. I burned seven or eight catties of coal more in a day. At night, I lay in bed tossing and turning, unable to sleep. I felt that this was not just burning a few more catties of coal, but forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings and burning away the idea of diligence and thrift. This showed that I had not truly established the idea of saving every piece of coal for the revolution. Chairman Mao said: "To make our country prosperous and strong, it takes decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of a policy of practicing strict economy and opposing waste to build the country diligently and thriftily." This made me understand that saving coal is to accelerate national construction. If I seek ease for myself, it will cause waste and affect national construction; if I am not afraid of trouble and not afraid of fatigue, it will add bricks and tiles to socialist construction and make contributions. From then on, I launched a struggle against the "selfishness" of seeking ease, taking the stove pit as a battlefield and the coal shovel as a weapon, ensuring that the coal was weighed before stoking, not losing any lumps; keeping an eye on the stove when stoking, observing carefully, and adding coal in a timely manner. Later, we also made an iron sieve to screen the coal kernels and mix them in for burning. Although this was dirty, tiring, and relatively laborious, we felt extremely happy whenever we saved an ounce of coal for the country. Therefore, a month later, the daily coal consumption per person was further reduced to four liang and eight qian. From this, I realized that the relationship between transforming the subjective world and transforming the objective world is: transforming people can transform things, and transforming things also transforms people. Truly, a red heart makes the stove fire burn brighter and brighter, and the stove fire makes thoughts more and more red.

        Tear Open the "Seal" and Charge Forward

    When coal consumption dropped to four liang and eight qian and received praise, some people in our squad said, "It's almost there," "It's just a matter of reducing coal consumption by one qian or half a qian, there's not much profit left." I also felt that being able to burn the fire to this extent was indeed almost there. So, I put a "seal" on four liang and eight qian.

    Was it really "almost there"? In order to clarify this issue, everyone sat down to study Chairman Mao's discourse on the laws of development of objective things. After discussion, we realized that objective things are constantly developing, and we must also look at coal saving work with a developmental perspective. There is no big profit, but there is still small profit. Big and small are relative, not absolute; small profits lead to big profits, with small profits, there is no worry about no big profits. As the saying goes: "Dripping water forms a river, accumulating grains forms a basket." If each person saves one liang of coal per day, a company will save more than a dozen catties a day, and several thousand catties a year. If 650 million people save like this, this is a remarkable number, and building socialism requires this revolutionary spirit of one liang and half a qian. With this revolutionary spirit, we can also make revolution on one liang and half a qian.

    How to break through the barrier of four liang and eight qian? At first, I just "fueled up" with enthusiasm, but coal consumption still hovered around four liang and eight qian. We were not reconciled and always felt that there was still potential to be tapped. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's discourse on methods of thinking and methods of work, we realized that it is not enough to only have the desire and drive to do a good job, we must also have the correct methods and a scientific attitude. Without a scientific attitude, only drive is reckless and cannot achieve anything. Only by combining the revolutionary spirit with the scientific attitude can we discover, create, and advance.

    Once, when stirring the fire, I found that crushed coal was leaking into the stove pit, which reminded me of the matter of burning smokeless coal mixed with yellow mud in my hometown. I thought to myself: If we mix smoky coal with yellow mud, it will be difficult to hook the coal, can't this also save coal? I and Sun Chengxiang conducted experiments together. At first, there was too little yellow mud mixed in, and it didn't save coal; if too much was mixed in, it wouldn't ignite, and it would suffocate the fire as soon as it was pressed on. Experiments failed again and again. I thought: For success, we must summarize experience, but we must take a positive attitude towards failure. Only in this way can we enhance our confidence and seek success. Although there are factors of success in failure, if we treat failure with a negative attitude, we cannot understand this law and turn failure into a driving force for success. So, we treated failure with a positive attitude and quickly found the reasons for the failure: Smoky coal and smokeless coal have different properties; smokeless coal has little adhesion and needs to be mixed with yellow mud to increase adhesion; smoky coal itself has adhesion, and if yellow mud is mixed in, the gaps will be smaller, air will not easily enter, and the fire will naturally suffocate. "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit," we were inspired by summarizing lessons.

    One day, I helped the comrade feeding the pigs to cook pig food, and unintentionally added some coal kernels and furnace ash into the hearth. Although the flames were very short, they quickly cooked the pig food. This incident attracted my attention, and I also recalled the situation where the furnace ash turned black when water was poured on it in the past, and I felt that the furnace ash contained carbon. I told everyone about this discovery, and they actively encouraged me to experiment with mixing furnace ash for burning. The first time, one catty of coal was mixed with three liang of furnace ash, which not only did not affect the firepower, but also reduced coal consumption, and I felt unspeakably happy. Then, I mixed in more furnace ash, but the firepower was not as good as before. In order to find the right ratio, I explored for more than half a month and finally figured out the ratio and method of mixing furnace ash for burning in various situations. The coal consumption was reduced to less than four liang, and the "seal" of "almost there" was torn off.

    Through tearing off the "seal," I realized that sticking the "seal" and tearing the "seal," failure and success, are both contradictory and unified and can be transformed into each other depending on certain conditions. The most fundamental condition is to have Chairman Mao's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win and a spirit of courageous practice. Only in this way can we tear open the "seal" and charge forward, dare to actively treat failure, and seek success from failure.

      Learning from Advanced Experience Must Start from Reality

    Through vigorously engaging in furnace ash mixing and burning, coal consumption has been greatly reduced. Can it be reduced further? I and several comrades in the squad sat around the stove, analyzing and studying the barriers to coal consumption one step at a time, and discovered a new problem: The coal used to keep the fire going after meals is too wasteful. This made me feel that after the coal consumption has been reduced to a certain level, the main contradiction of saving coal for stoking the fire is reduced to a secondary position, while keeping the fire going has shifted from a secondary contradiction to a main contradiction. Can the method of mixing furnace ash be used to keep the fire going? We did experiments according to the set of methods used to keep the fire going with furnace ash in boilers. However, after several experiments, we either extinguished the fire or burned the bottom fire completely. What was the reason? Through studying Chairman Mao's works, we realized that the reason for this failure was: Learning from the advanced experience of others, without specifically analyzing and treating specific situations, we committed the mistake of mechanically copying. Originally, the boiler area is large, and the bottom fire is thick, so it can be filled with more furnace ash; while the small double-eye return air stove has a small hearth and a thin bottom fire, so filling too little will burn too much, and filling too much will extinguish the fire. After finding the reason, we repeatedly studied and experimented based on the characteristics of the double-eye return air stove. Finally, we found a layered fire-keeping method suitable for double-eye return air stoves: that is, pressing a layer of furnace ash and then pressing a layer of coal. If the bottom fire is not good, press coal first and then ash; if the bottom fire is strong, press ash first and then coal. At the same time, we also found a method of slag removal and fire keeping.

    The success of the furnace ash fire-keeping experiment not only reduced the daily coal consumption per person a little more and found the overall law of fire stoking but also gave me great inspiration. Learning all advanced experiences must start from reality and combine advanced experiences with one's own specific situation.

    为革命烧火　心红火旺
    解放军某部三连炊事班长　张道路
    说起烧火来，好象很简单，实际上却不然，里边的学问可大着哩。两年的实践告诉我：只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，树立一心为革命的思想，才能把革命的火烧旺，节约更多的煤炭，促进革命事业的发展；不然的话，火烧不旺，饭做不好，还要浪费煤。
  对“出息”，不同阶级的人有不同的理解
    一九六三年八月，我应征入伍了。那时候我想：我是初中毕业生，如果上级叫我做技术工作，就太理想了。在我看来，干技术工作，在部队里能吃得开，回地方后也可以找个好工作，真是又“光彩”，又有“出息”。没想到，领导上却让我到炊事班。我暗想：“念了八九年的书，不学技术，拿烧火铲，这不是高射炮打蚊子吗？”越想越觉得当个
  “伙夫”没“出息”。
    有一次，我到卫生队看病。卫生员对我说：“小张，你身上有油味，是不是改善生活了？”这本来是无意中说出的话，我一听却似火上加油。回去就说：“咱们一出门，人家就知道是干啥的，有啥光彩！有啥出息！我是不想再干下去啦。”可是又一想，我是个新兵，来日方长，这样下去对自己没好处。又想：总不会叫我干一辈子这个工作吧？于是，我勉强干下去了。个人主义的算盘没有彻底扔掉，那能有干好工作的心眼！烧火的时候尽管也拿着煤铲站在灶前忙忙碌碌，其实心不在焉，马马虎虎。每天要烧一、二百斤煤，饭还做不好，伙食得不到改善，大家很有意见。
    后来，指导员主动找我谈心，劝我要活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上下功夫，不断改造非无产阶级思想，树立一心干革命的思想。我就学习了《为人民服务》。我想：张思德同志为什么热爱烧炭工作，甚至最后献出了自己最宝贵的生命？他对“出息”是怎样理解的，又是怎样对待的？毛主席又为什么写文章赞扬他为人民利益而死，“重于泰山”？想到这，我又联想到雷锋同志，他为什么能在平凡的工作岗位上愿做一颗革命的
  “螺丝钉”，为革命做出了不平凡的贡献呢？毛主席又为什么亲自题字，号召全国人民“向雷锋同志学习”呢？我带着这个问题，又认真地学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》。经过反复琢磨和同志们的帮助，我明确地认识到：所谓“出息”，不同阶级的人有不同的理解。在剥削阶级看来，个人主义第一，压迫别人，损人利己，处处追求个人的名誉、地位和物质享受，这就是他们最大的“出息”；而无产阶级革命者则相反，他们有远大的革命理想，时时想着中国革命和世界革命，把全心全意为人民服务，看成是自己最大的出息。张思德同志正是后一种人，所以他的死“重于泰山”，雷锋同志也正是这样的人，所以他成了伟大的共产主义战士。我是一个革命的青年，来到部队后，上级叫我当炊事员，我怎么能认为是“大材小用”、没有“出息”呢？一切工作都是为了革命，烧火做饭也是革命工作的一部分，革命工作哪有没出息的？把火烧好，把饭做好，使同志们身体健壮，精神饱满，练好杀敌本领，保卫社会主义建设，保卫世界和平，这不就是烧火的最大的出息、最大的光彩吗？这样一对照检查，才知道看待一个工作有没有出息，这里有个阶级立场问题。为人民服务，就是有出息，为个人打算，就是没有出息。我过去认为炊事工作没出息，就是因为自己的思想没有出息。其原因就是在思想上有着个人主义的私心，还没有树立起革命的世界观。从而使我感到：要为革命当好炊事员，就必须经常活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己的世界观，消除私心。只有这样才能为革命拿好煤铲子，为革命烧好火。
      烧火靠思想　心红火才旺
    要为革命烧好火，必须对各种私心进行坚决的斗争。人的主观因素发挥了，才能更好地掌握技术，把火烧旺。
    去年二月底，领导上为了给国家节约更多的煤炭，要我们改用双眼回风灶。并指出：这是伙房里的革命。可是，我却想不通。我认为：节约煤也得把饭做好，我们这么大个国家还供不起一个连队烧煤？有了这个想法，第一次用新灶做饭，引上火，添上煤，烟焖在灶膛里，火苗上不来。我就生了气，狠狠地捅起来，越捅越不旺，只见碎煤哗哗地往下漏。结果，雪白的大米变成了黄米饭。以后接连几天，做出的饭不是夹生，就是串烟，大家吃了很有意见。我心里更窝火，埋怨说：“用吹风机做饭多痛快！扔进几锹煤就不管了，放着省事的活不干，自找麻烦！”班里也有人觉得费力不讨好，埋怨不该改灶。
    这时，指导员帮助我们进行了研究。指出：火烧不着，饭做不好，不是新灶不如旧灶，主要是头脑里因循守旧的思想还太多，“革命”二字还太少，没有掌握新灶的特点，而主观上又不主动地去实践。并且告诉我们要好好地学习毛主席关于人和武器关系的论述，破除守旧思想，树立敢于革命的精神。我仔细一寻思，对！就照指导员的指点学习了毛主席著作。我想，毛主席强调的在战争中起决定性作用的人，应当是有高度的阶级觉悟，对革命事业极其负责，能够发挥主观能动作用的人。同样，只有这样的人，才能把灶改好，也能够掌握它的特点，掌握新的烧火方法，把火烧旺，把饭做好。这样一想，也就有信心，敢于革新了。于是我和大家一起苦心钻研，摸索了十五天，改修炉膛十九次，终于摸到了新灶的特点。从这以后，烧双眼回风灶就顺心了，使耗煤量由每人每日平均二斤多降到一斤左右。
    当然，思想改造不是一劳永逸的。在烧双眼回风灶的过程中，还要不断克服图省事的思想。有一次，我的关节炎又犯了，行走感到很吃力。为了自己得到休息，烧火时没有象以前那样把煤均匀地撒进炉膛里，而是一次多添一些。一天多烧了七、八斤煤。晚上，我躺在床上翻来复去地睡不着。觉得这不仅是多烧了几斤煤，而是忘了毛主席的教导，把勤俭节约的思想烧掉了。这说明我还没有真正树立起为革命而节约每一块煤的思想。毛主席说：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”这使我懂得了：节约煤炭是为了加速国家建设。如果自己图省事，就会造成浪费，影响国家建设；如果自己不怕麻烦，不怕劳累，就会给社会主义建设增添砖瓦，做出贡献。从此，我和图省事的“私心”展开了斗争，把灶坑当战场，把煤铲当武器，做到了烧火前把煤称好，块粒不丢；烧火时人不离灶，细心观察，适时添煤。后来，我们还做了个铁筛子，随时筛拣煤核掺烧。这样做，虽然又脏又累又比较费劲，可是每当我们为国家节约一两煤的时候，就感到无比的高兴。因此，一个月后，每人每日耗煤量又下降到四两八钱。由此，使我认识到改造主观世界和改造客观世界的关系是：改造了人，才能改造物，改造了物同时又改造了人。真是，心红使炉火越烧越旺，炉火又把思想越炼越红。
        撕开“封条”往前闯
    当耗煤量降到四两八钱，受到一片赞扬的时候，我们班就有人说：“差不多了”，“耗煤量再降也只是一钱半钱的，油水不大了”。我也觉得能把火烧到这么个程度，确实差不多了。于是，给四两八钱贴上了“封条”。
    真的“差不多”了吗？为了弄清这个问题，大家坐下来学习了毛主席关于客观事物发展规律的论述。经过讨论，才明白了：客观事物是不断发展的，我们也必须用发展的眼光看待节煤工作。大的油水没有，小的油水还是有的。大和小是相对的，不是绝对的；小中见大，有了小油水，就不愁没有大油水。俗话说：“滴水成河，积粒成箩”。每人每天节约一两煤，一个连队一天就是十几斤，一年就是几千斤。六亿五千万人都这样去节约，这可是一个了不起的数字，建设社会主义就需要这一两半钱的革命精神。有了这种革命精神，在一两半钱上面也能闹革命。
    怎样突破四两八钱这个关呢？开始，我只是从干劲上“加油”，但是，耗煤量仍在四两八钱左右晃来晃去。我们又不甘心，总觉得还有潜力可挖。经过反复学习毛主席关于思想方法和工作方法的论述，才知道：仅有做好工作的愿望和闯劲是不够的，还得要有正确的方法和科学的态度。如果没有科学的态度，只有闯劲，那是蛮闯，是闯不出什么名堂来的。只有把革命的精神和科学的态度结合起来，才能有所发现，有所创造，有所前进。
    一次拨火，我发现碎煤哗哗地往灶坑里漏，就联想到家乡烧无烟煤拌黄泥的事。心想：有烟煤拌黄泥掺烧，勾火勾不下煤，这不也可以节约吗？我和孙成祥一起进行了试验。开始，黄泥拌少了，不节约煤，拌多了，又不起火，一压上火就憋死了。一次又一次地试验，都失败了。我想：成功，固然要总结经验，但是，对于失败更要采取积极的态度，只有这样才能增强信心去求得成功。失败里面虽然有成功的因素，如果以消极态度对待失败，就不能认识这个规律，把失败变为成功的动力。于是，我们以积极态度对待失败，很快找出了失败的原因：有烟煤和无烟煤性质不一样，无烟煤粘结性小，需要拌黄泥增加粘结性；有烟煤本身就有粘结性，再拌上黄泥，间隙更小了，空气不易进去，火当然会憋死。“吃一堑，长一智”，从总结教训中得到了启发。
    一天，我帮助喂猪的同志煮猪食，无意中往灶膛里添进去一些煤核与炉灰，火苗虽然很短，却很快把猪食煮熟了。这件事，引起了我的注意，使我又联想到过去往炉灰上泼水炉灰变黑的情形，觉得炉灰里含有炭。我把这个发现告诉了大家，他们积极鼓励我试验掺烧炉灰。头一次，一斤煤掺三两炉灰，不但没影响火力，而且耗煤也有了下降，我心里说不出的高兴。接着多掺炉灰，但火力却不如以前了。为了找到合适的比例，摸了半个多月，终于摸出了在各种情况下掺烧炉灰的比例和方法。使耗煤量降到了四两以下，把“差不多”的“封条”撕掉了。
    通过撕“封条”，使我体会到：贴“封条”和撕“封条”，失败和成功，都是对立而又统一的，是可以依据一定的条件互相转化的。最根本的条件就是要有毛主席的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想和勇于实践的精神，只有这样，才能撕开“封条”往前闯，敢于积极对待失败，从失败中求成功。
      学习先进经验要从实际出发
    通过大搞炉灰掺烧，耗煤量有了大幅度下降。还能不能再降呢？我和班里几个同志围在炉旁，从耗煤的一道道关口，一步步地分析研究，又发现了新的问题：饭后用的压火煤太费。这使我感到：当耗煤量下降到一定程度以后，烧火节约煤的这个主要矛盾降低到次要地位，而压火就由次要矛盾转到主要矛盾上来了。能不能把炉灰掺烧方法用到压火上呢？我们就按照锅炉用炉灰压火的一套方法做了试验。可是，试验了几次，不是把火压死了，就是底火着光了。什么原因呢？通过学习毛主席著作，才使我们明白了这次失败的原因是：学习别人的先进经验，没有对具体情况进行具体分析，具体对待，犯了生搬硬套的错误。原来，锅炉面积大、底火厚，可以多压炉灰；而小小的双眼回风灶，灶膛小、底火薄，压少了燃过了头，压多了却又把火压死了。原因找到后，针对双眼回风灶的特点，又进行了反复研究，反复试验。最后，终于找出了一种适合双眼回风灶的分层压火法：即压一层炉灰再压一层煤，底火不好，就先压煤后压灰；底火旺，就先压灰后压煤。同时，还摸到了除渣压火的方法。
    炉灰压火试验成功，不仅使每人每天耗煤量又下降了一些，摸到了烧火的全程规律，而且从中也给了我很大启发。学习一切先进经验，必须从实际出发，把先进经验同自己的具体情况结合起来。
