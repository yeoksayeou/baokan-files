    Xinhua News Agency, 4th March—While Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah was abroad on a state visit, a military coup took place in Accra, the capital of Ghana, in the early hours of February 24th.

    Ghanaian radio broadcast a statement at 6 a.m. local time on February 24th, saying: "Colonel Kotoka, commander of the Second Infantry Brigade of the Ghanaian Army, announces that the army, in cooperation with the police, has taken over the government of Ghana as of today." Kotoka also announced the dissolution of the parliament, the dismissal of government ministers, and the dissolution of the People's Convention Party.

    It is reported that the coup forces met resistance from troops loyal to President Nkrumah and the presidential guard. Fierce fighting took place around the presidential palace. Some government ministers and leaders of the People's Convention Party were arrested.

    On the evening of February 24th, according to Ghanaian radio broadcasts, a seven-member "National Liberation Council" has been established to handle national affairs. The chairman of this council is Ankrah, the former Deputy Chief of Defense Staff who was dismissed by President Nkrumah last year, the vice-chairman is Police Inspector-General Harlley, and Kotoka is one of the members of this council. After the coup, Ankrah was promoted from Major General to Lieutenant General and designated as Commander of the Armed Forces; Kotoka was promoted to Major General and designated as Commander of the Army.

    According to Western news agencies on March 1st, the Ghanaian coup authorities in Accra, Tema, Kumasi, and in the jungle are still encountering resistance. Gunfire was still heard in Accra on the night of March 1st. Martial law was imposed at Accra's airport, with soldiers loading their guns and aiming at every landing aircraft.

    It is reported that after the Ghanaian military coup, British General Henry Alexander, who once served as Chief of Staff of the Ghanaian Armed Forces, hastily issued a statement praising the Ghanaian soldiers who launched the coup. He said that the Ghanaian coup was "excellent" for this West African country. Comments in the British bourgeois press do not hide their joy at the Ghanaian coup.

    On the day the coup occurred, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Williams immediately stated that the United States wants to maintain "good and beneficial" relations with the military in Ghana who launched the coup. According to a *New York Herald Tribune* correspondent in Washington, U.S. officials openly expressed their pleasure at the coup. Agence France-Presse reported from Washington on February 25th that the Johnson administration "is pleased" with the coup in Ghana "and intends to establish cordial relations with the new military leaders."

    加纳部分军队发动政变夺取政权
    美国官员和英国将军感到高兴　华盛顿希望保持“良好”关系
    新华社四日讯　在加纳总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛出国访问期间，二月二十四日凌晨在加纳首都阿克拉发生了军事政变。
    加纳电台在二月二十四日当地时间六点广播一篇声明说：“加纳陆军第二步兵旅旅长科托卡上校宣布，军队在警察的合作下从今天起已经接管了加纳政府。”科托卡还宣布解散议会，解除政府部长的职务和解散人民大会党。
    据报道，政变部队遭到忠于恩克鲁玛总统的军队和总统府卫队的抵抗。在总统府周围进行了激烈的战斗。一些政府部长和人民大会党的领导人被捕。
    二月二十四日晚上，据加纳电台广播，已经成立了一个由七人组成的“全国解放委员会”，来处理国家事务。这个委员会的主席是去年被恩克鲁玛总统解职的前副国防参谋长安克拉，副主席是警察总监哈利，科托卡是这个委员会的委员之一。政变后，安克拉由少将被提升为中将，并被指定为武装部队司令；科托卡被提升为少将，并被指定为陆军司令。
    据西方通讯社三月一日报道，加纳政变当局在阿克拉、特马、库马西和在丛林中仍然遭到抵抗。阿克拉在三月一日晚上还听到枪声。阿克拉的机场实行戒严，士兵们子弹上膛，瞄准着每一架降落的飞机。
    据报道，加纳军事政变发生后，曾担任加纳国防军参谋长的英国将军亨利·亚历山大连忙发表声明，对发动政变的加纳军人表示赞扬。他说，加纳政变对这个西非国家是“极好的”。英国资产阶级报纸的评论都不掩饰它们对加纳政变的高兴。
    政变发生的当天，美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿威廉斯立即表示，美国要同加纳发动政变的军方保持“良好和有利的”关系。据《纽约先驱论坛报》驻华盛顿记者报道，美国官员们对这次政变公开表示高兴。法新社记者二月二十五日从华盛顿报道，约翰逊政府对于加纳发生政变“是感到高兴的”，“并打算同新的军事领导人建立亲切的关系”。
