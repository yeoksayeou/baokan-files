    Young Pioneers Plant Cogongrass (Note)
    Wang Yinming
    Han River, waves surging,
    Ba Mountain white clouds reflected in the water.
    Red flags flutter, reflecting on the river,
    Young Pioneers plant cogongrass.
    You carry water, I lift the hoe,
    Sweat mingled with river water irrigates.
    One plant a row, row after row,
    The beach is wrapped in a green waistband.
    Not picky about the environment, roots and leaves flourish,
    Wind and rain cannot wither;
    Standing at the forefront of flood control,
    Steadfastly protecting the levee.

  A blade of grass, a steel knife,
  Chops waves and battles the raging tide;
  A clump of branches, a bunker,
  Not allowing floods to change course at will...
    Han River, waves surging,
    The banks are full of songs and the river full of laughter.
    Cogongrass and Pioneers grow together,
    Spring breeze and rain make them rise higher and higher!
    Note: Cogongrass has deep roots and propagates quickly, making it a good plant for flood control, levee protection, and soil and water conservation. The people on both sides of the Han River are planting this plant in large quantities.

    少先队员栽芭茅（注）
    王寅明汉江河，浪滔滔，巴山白云水底飘。风展红旗映江面，少先队员栽芭茅。你担水、我举镐，汗水和着江水浇。
  一株一行又一片，沙滩缠上绿围腰。不择环境根叶茂，风吹雨打永不凋；抗洪站在最前哨，挺身护堤脚跟牢。
  一片叶子，一把钢刀，斩波劈浪战狂涛；
  一丛枝条，一座碉堡，不准洪水乱改道……汉江河，浪滔滔，满岸歌声满河笑。芭茅、队员同成长，春风化雨节节高！
    注：芭茅扎根深，繁殖快，是防洪护堤、水土保持的好植物。汉江两岸的人民正在大量种植这种植物。
