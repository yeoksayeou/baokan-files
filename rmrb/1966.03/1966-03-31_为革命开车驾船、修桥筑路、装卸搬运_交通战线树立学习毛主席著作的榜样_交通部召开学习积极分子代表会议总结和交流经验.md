    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: A large number of activists who creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works have emerged in the national transportation system. They have drawn tremendous spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of driving and sailing ships for the revolution, building bridges and roads for the revolution, loading and unloading for the revolution, and doing all work for the revolution. They have made extraordinary achievements for the country and the people in their respective ordinary positions.
    The staff of the Fengjie Channel Section of the Yangtze River Shipping Company creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, consciously using Zhang Side and Bai Qiu'en as two mirrors, and completely and thoroughly serving the people as two measuring sticks, to educate and spur themselves on. On the 130-kilometer dangerous waterway of the Three Gorges of the Sichuan River, they persist year after year in fighting floods, reefs, and storms, wholeheartedly serving ships. The entire section has achieved bright lights and clear signs. In order to grasp the natural laws of the Sichuan River, they do not avoid difficulties and dangers, exploring the water, fighting reefs, and measuring wind conditions. They finally gained the initiative in managing the channel, ensuring safe navigation for three consecutive years, and becoming a model for national channel work.
    The 308 Road Construction Team of the Transportation Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region fights on the plateau with perennial snow and an altitude of 4,500 meters. With the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains, they endure great hardships and hard work, overcome numerous difficulties, and have built roads in perennially frozen areas and on cliffs, initially changing the past situation where plateau roads could not pass through or connect. They have made great contributions to the construction of the frontier of the motherland.
    Many activists in studying Chairman Mao's works follow Chairman Mao's teaching of wholeheartedly serving the people, working hard on the four words "thoroughly" and "completely," and raising transportation services to a new level. Yang Huaiyuan, a service member on the Democratic No. 5 Wheel of the Shanghai Shipping Company, is a prominent example. He considers everything for the passengers, enthusiastically serves the passengers, does not mind dirt or fatigue, and whether it is holding children, washing diapers, carrying luggage, or taking care of sick passengers, he consciously and happily does everything that passengers need and that he can do, truly becoming a people's servant, making extraordinary achievements in ordinary work positions, and being praised by passengers.
    These workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a very high spiritual realm. They always put class interests first, and revolutionary interests first, demonstrating a lofty communist spirit. Liu Yuanfu, captain of the Guangdong Yuehe barge, and Luo Hongyuan, a wooden boat worker on the Jialing River in Sichuan, both activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly risked their lives to fight against torrents and whirlpools in the transportation process in order to rescue state property and people who fell into the water. Over the past few years, Luo Hongyuan has led the masses to rescue state grain, steel, and other materials worth more than 500,000 yuan. Liu Yuanfu has rescued more than 20 people from the water. Li Wenjie, a repairman from the Chinese aid to Yemen highway expert group, recently bravely rescued a rock crusher while being burned in a fire accident in Yemen and was gloriously injured, demonstrating the noble qualities and internationalist spirit of the Chinese working class.
    The entire crew of the Nanhai 155 Wheel of the Guangzhou Maritime Transport Bureau is an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works. They constantly arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and their class consciousness is constantly improved, so they show great fearless heroism in the face of the enemy. The workers of the 155 Wheel undertake transportation tasks between China and Vietnam and Cambodia. Each of their voyages faces the crazy provocations of American imperialism. Either enemy planes circle overhead and dive to strafe, or enemy ships block the way, but all the crew members are calm and fearless, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's provocations and excellently completing the transportation tasks, being hailed as the "sea hard bones" on the transportation front.
    Recently, the Ministry of Communications convened a meeting of activist representatives of the transportation system in Beijing to study Chairman Mao's works, summarize and exchange their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. The Ministry of Communications believes that they have set an example for the broad masses of cadres and workers in the transportation system, calling on workers throughout the national transportation system to learn from them and launch a new upsurge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    为革命开车驾船、修桥筑路、装卸搬运
    交通战线树立学习毛主席著作的榜样
    交通部召开学习积极分子代表会议总结和交流经验
    据新华社二十八日讯  全国交通系统涌现了一大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。他们从毛主席著作中吸取了巨大的精神力量，树立了为革命开车驾船、为革命修桥筑路、为革命装卸搬运、为革命干一切工作的思想，在各自不同的平凡岗位上为国家为人民作出了不平凡的事迹。
    长江航运公司奉节航道段职工活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地以张思德和白求恩两面镜子，以完全、彻底为人民服务两把尺子，教育和鞭策自己，在川江三峡天险一百三十多公里的航道上，成年累月坚持同洪水、暗礁、急风暴雨作斗争，全心全意为行船服务，全段做到了灯光明亮、标志鲜明。为了掌握川江的自然规律，他们不避艰难险阻，摸水性，斗礁石，测风情，终于取得了管好航道的主动权，连续三年确保了行船安全，成为全国航道工作标兵。
    新疆维吾尔自治区交通厅三○八筑路队，战斗在终年积雪、海拔四五千米的高原上。他们以愚公移山的精神，吃大苦耐大劳，克服了重重困难，在千年不化的冰冻地带和悬崖峭壁上修通了公路，初步改变了以往高原公路通不过、联不上的局面，为祖国边疆建设作出很大贡献。
    许多学习毛主席著作积极分子遵循毛主席提出的全心全意为人民服务的教导，在“彻底”和“完全”四个字上狠下功夫，把交通服务工作提到了一个新的水平上。上海轮船公司民主五号轮服务员杨怀远就是一个突出的典型。他处处为旅客着想，热情为旅客服务，不嫌脏、不怕累，不论是抱孩子、洗尿布、挑行李，还是照料生病的旅客，凡是旅客需要的、自己力所能及的事，他都自觉愉快地做，真正成为一名人民勤务员，在平凡工作岗位上做出不平凡的事迹，受到旅客们的赞扬。
    这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的职工，有着很高的精神境界。他们处处以阶级利益为重，以革命利益为重，表现了崇高的共产主义精神。学习毛主席著作的积极分子广东粤河驳船驾长刘源富和四川嘉陵江木船船工罗洪元，在运输过程中为了抢救国家财产和落水的人们，曾经多次冒着生命危险同激流漩涡搏斗。几年来，罗洪元带领群众抢救国家粮食、钢铁等物资总值达五十多万元。刘源富先后从水中救起二十多人。我国援助也门公路专家组修理工李文杰，最近在也门一次火灾事故中，不畏烈火烧身，抢救轧石机而光荣负伤，表现了中国工人阶级的高尚品质和国际主义精神。
    广州海运局南海一五五轮全体船员，是一个学习毛主席著作的先进集体。他们不断用毛泽东思想武装自己，阶级觉悟不断提高，因而在敌人面前表现了大无畏的英雄气概。一五五轮职工担负我国和越南、柬埔寨之间的运输任务。他们每一次航行，都面临美帝国主义的疯狂挑衅，不是敌机在上空盘旋俯冲扫射，就是敌舰在前面阻拦，但是全体船员个个镇定自若，毫不畏惧，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的挑衅，出色地完成了运输任务，被人们誉为交通战线上的“海上硬骨头”。
    最近，交通部在北京召开了交通系统学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议，总结交流了他们学习毛主席著作的经验。交通部认为他们给交通系统的广大干部和职工树立了榜样，号召全国交通系统职工向他们学习，掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
