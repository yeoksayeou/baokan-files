    Indonesian Government Unreasonably Announces "Temporary Closure"
    Xinhua News Agency Branch Xinhua News Agency Issues Statement Expressing Strong Protest
    Solemnly points out: All facts show that the slander, persecution, and final closure of the Xinhua News Agency branch are part of a anti-China conspiracy by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. This serious step, which deliberately cuts off the link between the friendship of the two peoples and damages the relations between the two countries, violates the wishes of the broad masses of the Indonesian people and can only benefit imperialism and new and old colonialism, especially US imperialism.
    The voice of truth cannot be blocked
    The cause of justice will surely triumph
    Xinhua News Agency, March 25th. Xinhua News Agency issued a protest statement regarding the Indonesian government's unreasonable announcement of the "temporary closure" of the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    On March 25, 1966, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified Zhang Haitao, the director of the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch, unreasonably announcing the "temporary closure" of the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch, revoking the journalist credentials of Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta reporters, ceasing all their reporting activities, and stopping the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch from distributing Xinhua News Agency news releases in Indonesia. Xinhua News Agency expresses a strong protest against this serious step by the Indonesian government that deliberately undermines relations between the two countries.
    The Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch was established in 1954. For twelve years, the Xinhua branch has truthfully, accurately, and extensively reported on the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggles against new and old colonialism, to safeguard national independence, and to strive for democracy and progress. It has reported on the strengthening and development of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. The Xinhua branch has also introduced China's construction and development to the Indonesian people through the Jakarta edition of Xinhua News Agency news releases and Xinhua News Agency news photos, as well as the surging anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles around the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the sympathy and support of the world's people for the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggles. Indonesian newspapers and periodicals have widely used Xinhua News Agency's news releases, and people from all walks of life in Indonesia have enthusiastically praised and highly valued the work of the Xinhua branch, considering the work of the Xinhua branch to be one of the strong links strengthening the friendship between the two peoples.
    Now, the Indonesian government has unreasonably forcibly closed the Xinhua branch, cutting off this link of friendship between the two peoples, thereby seriously damaging the relations between China and Indonesia. This behavior, which violates the wishes of the broad masses of the Indonesian people, can only benefit imperialism and new and old colonialism, especially US imperialism.
    In fact, since the drastic changes in the Indonesian political situation in October 1965, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have launched a frenzied anti-China, anti-Chinese, anti-communist, and anti-people wave, constantly attacking and persecuting the Xinhua branch, clamoring to "smash" the Xinhua branch. Since last October, the Xinhua branch's telecommunications links with China have been cut off several times, and news releases published by the Xinhua branch have been seized. On October 30, 1965, a unit of the army armed with guns and ammunition suddenly surrounded the Xinhua branch, climbed over the walls and entered the premises, causing trouble and harassment for an hour and a half. Subsequently, the military sent armed personnel and plainclothes agents to monitor the Xinhua branch. On March 9, 1966, Indonesian reactionary forces took even more appalling measures, organizing hundreds of thugs to launch a frenzied attack on the Xinhua branch. They openly shouted slogans such as "Smash the People's Republic of China" and "Kill you all," injuring three Xinhua News Agency reporters, including Zhang Haitao, and two staff members, setting fire to the Xinhua branch's office premises, and wantonly destroying and looting various supplies. This atrocity, rare in the history of international relations, shows that the anti-China activities of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have reached an extreme point. All of this fully shows that the slander, persecution, and final closure of the Xinhua branch are part of an anti-China conspiracy by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, and they must bear full responsibility for their series of atrocities persecuting the Xinhua branch.
    The Indonesian government has fabricated various excuses for closing the Xinhua branch, saying that the Xinhua News Agency's reports are "inflammatory," are "hostile propaganda," and "tend to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs," and so on. These are all groundless slanders.
    Since last October, the Xinhua News Agency has made some objective reports on the situation in Indonesia. All these reports are based on facts. The Xinhua News Agency reported on the extremely serious anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents that occurred in Indonesia and published relevant notes from the Chinese government, which is perfectly justified and absolutely legitimate. World progressive public opinion has every right to truthfully report and comment on the perverse acts of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. It is ridiculous for the Indonesian government to say that these reports are "inciting discord," "hostile propaganda," and "interfering in internal affairs." When announcing the closure of the Xinhua branch, the Indonesian government even claimed that this was to "prevent the further deterioration of good relations between Indonesia and People's China," which is a completely deceptive trick. Everyone knows that it is the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, supported by imperialism and new and old colonialism, who are undermining the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. They have committed countless anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes while vigorously opposing communism and China and shouting "Long Live America." The Xinhua News Agency's exposure of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' conspiracy to frantically oppose China and undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is precisely to safeguard the anti-imperialist solidarity and fighting friendship between the two peoples.
    We firmly believe that although the Xinhua branch has been closed, the long-standing great friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples cannot be destroyed by any force. The Xinhua News Agency's position of upholding truth and safeguarding justice is unshakable. We will, as always, support the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggles against imperialism and new and old colonialism, to safeguard national independence and to strive for democracy and progress. The voice of truth cannot be blocked. The cause of justice will surely triumph!

    印度尼西亚政府无理宣布“暂时封闭”
    新华分社新华社发表声明提出强烈抗议
    严正指出：一切事实表明，诬蔑、迫害和最后封闭新华分社，是印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华阴谋的一个组成部分。这种蓄意切断联系两国人民友谊的纽带、破坏两国关系的严重步骤，违反印度尼西亚广大人民的愿望，只能有利于帝国主义和新老殖民主义，特别是美帝国主义。
    真理的声音封锁不了
    正义的事业必定胜利
    新华社二十五日讯　新华通讯社就印度尼西亚政府无理宣布“暂时封闭”新华社驻雅加达分社发表抗议声明。声明全文如下：
    印度尼西亚政府外交部于一九六六年三月二十五日通知新华社驻雅加达分社社长张海涛，无理宣布“暂时封闭”新华社驻雅加达分社，撤销新华社驻雅加达记者的记者证，停止他们的一切报道活动，并停止新华社驻雅加达分社在印度尼西亚发行新华社新闻稿。新华通讯社对印度尼西亚政府这一蓄意破坏两国关系的严重步骤，提出强烈的抗议。
    新华社驻雅加达分社是一九五四年建立的。十二年来，新华分社真实、正确、大量地报道了印度尼西亚人民反对新老殖民主义、维护民族独立和争取民主、进步的革命斗争，报道了中国人民和印度尼西亚人民战斗友谊的加强和发展。新华分社还通过新华社新闻稿雅加达版和新华社新闻图片，向印度尼西亚人民介绍了中国的建设和发展，介绍了世界各地特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲风起云涌的反帝反殖斗争，以及世界人民对印度尼西亚人民革命斗争的同情和支持。印度尼西亚报刊曾广泛地采用了新华社的新闻稿件，印度尼西亚各界人士也热情赞扬和高度评价新华分社的工作，认为新华分社的工作是加强两国人民友谊的强有力的纽带之一。
    现在，印度尼西亚政府毫无道理地强行封闭了新华分社，切断了这条联系两国人民的友谊的纽带，从而严重地破坏了中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的关系。这种违反印度尼西亚广大人民愿望的行为，只能有利于帝国主义和新老殖民主义，特别是美帝国主义。
    事实上，自从一九六五年十月印度尼西亚政局发生急剧变化以后，印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起疯狂的反华、排华、反共、反人民的浪潮，一直不断地攻击和迫害新华分社，叫嚷要“粉碎”新华分社。自去年十月以来，新华分社同国内的电讯联系数度被切断，新华分社出版的新闻稿被扣压。一九六五年十月三十日，一部分陆军荷枪实弹，突然包围新华分社，翻墙入院，捣乱骚扰一个半小时，随后军方又派武装人员和便衣监视新华分社。一九六六年三月九日，印度尼西亚反动势力更采取了骇人听闻的手段，组织暴徒数百人疯狂袭击新华分社。他们公然狂呼“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“全部杀死你们”等口号，打伤新华社记者张海涛等三人和工作人员二人，纵火焚烧新华分社办公处所，并肆意捣毁和抢走了各种用具。这种国际关系史上罕见的暴行，说明印度尼西亚右派反动势力的反华活动已猖狂到了极点。这一切充分表明，诬蔑、迫害和最后封闭新华分社，是印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华阴谋的一个组成部分，他们必须对他们迫害新华分社的一系列暴行承担完全的责任。
    印度尼西亚政府为封闭新华分社，编造了种种借口，说什么新华通讯社的报道是“煽动性”的，是“敌对宣传”，“倾向于干涉印度尼西亚内政”，等等。这些都是毫无道理的诽谤。
    自从去年十月以来，新华通讯社对印度尼西亚的局势作了一些客观报道。所有这些报道，没有一件没有根据，没有一件不是事实。新华通讯社报道了在印度尼西亚发生的极端严重的反华、排华事件，发表了中国政府的有关照会，这是天经地义、绝对正当的。对于印度尼西亚右派反动势力的倒行逆施，全世界进步舆论完全有权如实报道和评论。印度尼西亚政府把这些报道说成是“煽动不和”，“敌对宣传”，“干涉内政”，是非常可笑的。印度尼西亚政府在宣布封闭新华分社时，还硬把这说成是“防止印度尼西亚同人民中国的良好关系进一步恶化”，这完全是骗人的把戏。谁都知道，破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好关系的，是得到帝国主义和新老殖民主义支持的印度尼西亚右派反动势力，他们一面大举反共、反华，一面高呼“美国万岁”，犯下了无数的反华、排华罪行。新华通讯社揭露印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂反华，破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友谊的阴谋，恰恰是为了维护两国人民的反帝团结和战斗友谊。
    我们坚信：虽然新华分社被封闭，但是中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间历史悠久的伟大友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。新华通讯社坚持真理、维护正义的立场是不可动摇的。我们将一如既往地支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，维护民族独立和争取民主、进步的革命斗争。真理的声音是封锁不了的。正义的事业必定胜利！　　一九六六年三月二十五日于北京
