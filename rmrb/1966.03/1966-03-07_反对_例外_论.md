    Opposing "Exceptionalism"
    Worker of Beijing United Plate Making Factory, Hua Youyi
    Editor's Note: Currently, a new movement of increasing production and practicing economy is rising on the national industrial front. Starting today, the supplement will open a "Miscellaneous Talks on Increasing Production and Practicing Economy" column, expressing opinions on various living thoughts in the movement of increasing production and practicing economy. We hope readers will actively contribute.
    In the current movement of increasing production and practicing economy, the vast number of workers in our factory have further established the idea of taking thrift as an honor and waste as a shame. Take the plate making process as an example. The main materials they use are non-ferrous metals—copper and zinc. The material usage standard stipulates that the edges of each plate should not be wider than one centimeter. Since the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, they have tried every means to save copper. Not only did they strive to be clever tailors when cutting materials, but they also compressed the edge, which was originally specified to have one centimeter of extra material, to zero point five centimeters. They have truly achieved a "penny-pinching" attitude to save copper for socialism!
    However, I have also seen another situation: A comrade engaged in new technology experiments used materials lavishly during plate making, widening the specified one-centimeter edge to one and a half centimeters. When workers raised their opinions to him, he said nonchalantly: "I am doing experiments, saving can be an 'exception' for my work."
    Is it true that practicing economy can be an "exception" when conducting experiments? In my opinion, this "exceptionalism" is wrong. When conducting experiments, one may encounter failures once, twice, dozens, or even hundreds of times. In order to achieve the success of the experiment, this kind of "waste" is necessary and indispensable. This kind of "waste" is the "capital" that should be spent to achieve the success of the experiment, and is not actually waste. But one must not draw the conclusion that one can be lavish and not pay attention to saving when conducting experiments. On the contrary, in the process of conducting experiments, we should also strive to save and spend as little "capital" as possible.
    We should adhere to the principle of saving at all times, in all matters, and in all places, and oppose all kinds of "exceptionalism."

### 反对“例外”论

专栏：增产节约杂谈

    反对“例外”论
    北京市联合制版厂工人　华有益
    编者按：当前，一个新的增产节约运动正在全国工业战线上兴起。从今天起，副刊开辟一个“增产节约杂谈”的栏目，针对增产节约运动中的各种活思想，发表议论。希望读者们踊跃来稿。
    在当前的增产节约运动中，我厂广大职工进一步树立了节约为荣，浪费为耻的思想。就拿晒版工序来说吧，他们用的主料是有色金属——铜和锌，用料指标规定，每块版四周边缘不得宽于一公分。增产节约运动开展以来，他们就千方百计节约用铜，开料时不仅争做巧裁缝，而且把规定有一公分富余的边缘压缩到零点五公分。为社会主义节约用铜，他们真是做到了“分分计较”的地步！
    然而，我也见到另一种情景：有一位搞新技术试验的同志，在晒版时用料大手大脚，把留一公分边缘的规定放宽到一点五公分。工人向他提出了意见，他却满不在乎地说：“我是搞试验的，节约对我的工作来说，可以‘例外’”。
    厉行节约，搞试验就可以“例外”吗？我认为，这种“例外”论是不对的。搞试验，可能会碰到一次、二次、几十次甚至几百次的失败；为了求得试验的成功，这种“浪费”是必要的，决不可少的。这种“浪费”，是为了求得试验成功应当花的“本钱”，实际上并不是浪费。但千万不能得出这样的结论：搞试验，就可以大手大脚，不注意节约了。恰恰相反，在搞试验的过程中，我们也应当力求节约，尽可能的少花“本钱”。
    我们应该时时、事事、处处坚持节约这个原则，反对各种“例外”论。
