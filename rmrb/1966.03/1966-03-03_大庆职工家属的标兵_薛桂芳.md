    Xue Guifang, a Model for Oilfield Workers' Families
    Lit the First Torch for Oilfield Families to Make Revolution

    Spring of 1962, a day with a Force 7 gale.

    On the vast wilderness, gusts of sand were swirling. An old woman, nearly fifty years old, led four young women, carrying three children on their backs, shouldering five iron shovels, carrying a kerosene lamp, and carrying luggage, embarked on the journey of reclamation, heading towards the depths of the wilderness.

    They were the first batch of reclaimers from the families of Daqing Oilfield workers.

    Leading the team was Xue Guifang, a worker's family member with a poor peasant background. She was the first among more than 20,000 family members to raise her hand, respond to the call of the Daqing Oilfield Party Committee, and sign up to participate in collective production labor.

    The road to reclamation was not smooth. Before them lay all the hardships that reclaimers could encounter. However, the more difficult thing was how to break through the ingrained habits that restricted the families of workers from engaging in productive labor.

    Before they embarked on their journey, some well-meaning people advised Xue Guifang: "How can workers' families reclaim land and cultivate the fields? Besides, your sons and daughters all have jobs, and your old man also earns money. You should be enjoying life. Why do you have to suffer that hardship?"

    Xue Guifang had her own ideas. She replied in a soft voice: "This depends on who you're talking to. We were poor people in the old days and were used to laboring since childhood. Don't look at how old I am, I can never forget the suffering in the old society, and I can't stay at home even if life is good. Listening to the Party and going to reclaim land is to contribute to socialism."

    These five women did not retreat in the face of this ingrained habit that restricted them.

    That day, they walked a path in the wilderness amid the sky filled with sand, taking difficult steps.

    At dusk, they arrived at the virgin land that was about to be cultivated. Here, there were only four pillars and a pile of sheep grass left by the oil drilling workers some time ago. They put up a temporary shed to settle down, and spread the ground with sheep grass. That's how they settled down.

    The next morning, each of them picked up an iron shovel and shoveled the black, oily soil on the wilderness. The land that had been sleeping for thousands of years slowly awakened under their hands.

    In the first three days, they each had blisters on their hands and purple scars. They opened up five mu of land.

    The news of Xue Guifang's reclamation spread among the families of oil workers like a thunderclap in spring.

    Then eighteen more family members came, and they also borrowed a wooden plow.

    At first, everyone was full of enthusiasm, digging the ground with shovels and pulling the plow with people. No one bowed their heads in the face of difficulties.

    As the days passed, some young people who had grown up in the "sugar water" of the new society, without experiencing such hardships, had blisters on their hands, their bodies ached all over, and they were burdened by their children, secretly complaining. Some regretted it, and some simply wanted to turn back and go home to enjoy a leisurely life.

    People who had been skeptical about family reclamation at the beginning also took the opportunity to clamor: "I knew it wouldn't work!" "Family members should just stay at home and take care of the children and serve their husbands." "Okay, can't I support you with so much money I make a month? You better come back early!" Some simply took their wives back home.

    In this way, three or two people left the reclamation team one after another. In less than a few days, more than half of the people had left. The remaining dozen or so people were also unstable in their thoughts, and even they themselves doubted whether this path of family members reclaiming land and cultivating the fields could be successful.

    During these days, Xue Guifang felt like a stone was pressing on her heart. The remaining people were all looking at her, waiting for her to make a decision and take charge.

    "I don't believe this road can't be taken. Even if I'm the only old woman left, I will work to the end!" She showed everyone the scars on her hands: "This scar was from when I was a child and worked for the landlord and was tortured. One day, I was so hungry that I scooped up a mouthful of millet rice from the landlord's dog food bowl to eat, and was discovered by the landlord's wife. She hit me on the head with a stick, knocked me down, and my hand touched the knife, leaving this scar. I will never forget it until I die. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would I be today? When I think of the suffering I endured in the old society, I am not afraid of any hardship."

    Xue Guifang's words deeply moved the hearts of the young reclamation team members. They said: "We can never forget Grandma Xue's words, we can never forget the class suffering endured by the older generation, we must be like Grandma Xue and work to the end!"

    They persevered in the wilderness. That year, they finally opened up thirty-two mu of wasteland and harvested more than three thousand catties of grain. For those who looked down on family members participating in productive labor, this little bit of land and this little bit of grain were indeed nothing great; but what was valuable was that they lit the first torch for oilfield families to make revolution.

    The Daqing Oilfield Party Committee seized this new thing that had just emerged from the Xue Guifang-led reclamation team, and vigorously praised it, publicized it, and promoted it among all oilfield workers and their families, supporting it in all aspects, so that this revolutionary torch quickly spread like a prairie fire. Throughout the oilfield, family production teams and workers' villages were established one after another.

    At present, there are more than four hundred family production teams like Xue Guifang's in Daqing Oilfield. In 1965, they harvested more than 40 million catties of grain, more than 30 million catties of vegetables, and also produced a large amount of meat, eggs, and other non-staple foods. They established nurseries, canteens, sewing groups, and workshops for processing various foods, and established part-work, part-study schools. Ninety-five percent of the family members with labor ability in the entire mining area have participated in collective production labor. Now they think of the collective, love labor, talk about diligence and thrift, and do revolution. As the oilfield workers praised them: "Our family members are holding up half the sky."

    Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm the Minds of Oilfield Workers' Families

    The family members of Xue Guifang's production team came from more than a dozen provinces and cities. Their origins and experiences were different, and their thoughts were also branded with different classes.

    Xue Guifang, the political instructor of this production team, thought: If we want to make the family members willing to participate in collective production labor, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their thinking and make them understand the revolutionary significance of participating in collective production labor.

    On the road to ideological revolutionization of family members, Xue Guifang became the guide for the family members.

    Sun Faying is a family member of a worker from a poor peasant family in northern Jiangsu. When she came to Daqing in 1960, the oilfield had just been developed, and the family members had not yet been organized. At that time, the neighbors talked about eating, drinking, and dressing. Over time, she got used to the non-laborious life that she couldn't stand before, and her idle hands became idle. She thought: Her mouth hangs on her husband's shoulders, he earns money, and she eats, which is more comfortable. In this way, she stayed at home from 1960 to 1963.

    The tide of the Daqing family revolution broke Sun Faying's "peaceful" ideological and living world.

    The turning point started from an unforgettable recollection of bitterness meeting.

    At that recollection of bitterness meeting, Xue Guifang told her sisters about her bitter life experience before liberation. She said that at that time, a family of four or five people worked desperately for the landlord, but in the end they still couldn't eat or wear enough. Her husband was a drilling worker who was injured at work, but the capitalist not only did not give him treatment, but fired him instead. In that dark and hopeless year, the fate of all poor people in the world was the same, bitter than coptis…

    The more Xue Guifang spoke, the more painful she became. Every word and sentence powerfully touched the hearts of the sisters. Sun Faying and many others couldn't help but shed tears.

    That day, Sun Faying's mind was surging, thinking of the sad family history that her mother told her: In the year she was born, her father dragged his sickly body to work as a long-term worker for the landlord in order to keep his family of three alive, and was tortured to death.

    In the evening, her husband also told her about his family history: Before liberation, in a year of severe drought on the plains of northern Jiangsu, his family of old and young begged for food, and his father was reluctant to eat the little bit of leftover soup and rice that he begged for, and starved to death by the sea.

    A series of sad past events awakened Sun Faying's class consciousness. This working woman who had been following her mother to herd cattle and farm since she was a child, and even worked as a production team leader in the countryside after she got married, asked herself: Faying, where has your working people's quality gone? Don't you feel ashamed for not working? Why don't you firmly remember the truth: forgetting the class bitterness is forgetting the root, losing labor is losing the nature of the working people?

    The next spring, she joined the family production team. She and her sisters studied Chairman Mao's works together and worked together, and her horizons became wider.

    At first, Xue Guifang led everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, and Sun Faying said that she couldn't read a word and couldn't learn it. However, Xue Guifang's example of hard study educated her.

    Xue Guifang also couldn't read a word, but she didn't retreat in the face of difficulties. She took Chairman Mao's book and asked people who could read to teach her. At night, she often asked her youngest daughter to read Chairman Mao's works to her, sometimes reading until very late. She eagerly studied culture, determined to break through this barrier between her and Chairman Mao's works.

    Sun Faying followed Grandma Xue's example, listening when others read, and participating in discussions. If she didn't recognize the words, she asked everywhere.

    After reading Chairman Mao's books, Sun Faying felt clear-headed. She gradually understood that whether or not to labor was not only a matter of forgetting the root or not, but also a matter of revolution or not. When she truly understood the meaning of labor, she had inexhaustible energy. No matter what she did, no matter how heavy the work was, she rushed forward with all her strength, not knowing what hardship or fatigue was. Last year, she was elected as the production team leader, and then was rated as a "Five-Good" family member.

    Dong Ying is another type of young family member. She is a junior high school graduate. Like many educated youths, she came to Daqing with her own "ideals". She envied car drivers driving around, felt that instrument workers were relaxed and comfortable, and also wanted to try driving a tractor on the prairie. However, when it came to participating in agricultural production labor, she thought that it was not something that people who had studied for so many years like her should do.

    She participated in the family production team with her own plans, thinking that as long as she performed well, the leadership would definitely "pull" her out and introduce her to a job she yearned for. She waited for that day.

    However, agricultural labor was by no means as easy as she imagined. The hoe and sickle seemed to weigh a thousand pounds in her hands and were out of control. When others had hoed to the end of the row, she had only hoed to the middle; when harvesting crops, others had already harvested two rows, and she had not yet finished one row.

    Whenever this happened, it was always Grandma Xue, whom she thought was clumsy and uneducated, who came to teach her and help her hand in hand. Xue Guifang helped her learn production technology, and Xue Guifang's love for agriculture also deeply infected her.

    Soon, Dong Ying encountered an unexpected thing. At an award ceremony in the entire oilfield, their family production team was named a "Pacesetter Team" together with two advanced production units. Leaders of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry personally presented them with the award flag. Why did the higher authorities attach so much importance to family production labor? Isn't it because family members, like workers, are doing revolutionary work. At this time, she remembered that Grandma Xue had told her more than once that working and farming are both revolutionary work. In the past, she couldn't listen to these words, but now she realized something.

    Dong Ying started to make some progress, and Grandma Xue encouraged her, saying: "You are young and educated. If you can't figure something out, read Chairman Mao's books and see what he said. You will be right to do what he says."

    Dong Ying opened Chairman Mao's book and found the key to happiness. Many doubts in her heart were dispelled, and many knots in her mind were untied. She studied the article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and dug out the roots of the problems in her thinking. She was born in a middle-peasant family, and the seeds of "for me and for myself" were planted in her heart since she was a child. Weren't her original "ideals" based on personal ideas! What an ugly thought! She was determined to unify her future with the needs of the revolution, do something in agricultural production, and be a laborer and revolutionary who is "both physically and mentally present" like Grandma Xue.

    Zhou Xizhen, a family member of a worker, was born in a merchant family and had done business with her father when she was a child. This planted a "root" in her mind - planning for herself everywhere and wanting to earn more money. When she came to Daqing, she treated collective labor with this kind of thinking.

    The labor remuneration for Daqing workers' family members is evaluated and recorded based on labor, and distributed according to work. Zhou Xizhen was a nursery worker, and a knot was tied in her thinking: taking care of children earns one less work point than working in the fields. After calculating again and again, she always felt that it was not worth it and was unwilling to do it.

    Xue Guifang's thoughts were different from Zhou Xizhen's. She was not a nursery worker, but she put more effort into the children in the nursery than the nursery workers. Before winter came, she busied herself with repairing the stove, sealing the windows, and preparing for the winter for the nursery. In the summer, when the children's mothers went to the fields, she repeatedly reminded the nursery workers to take care of the children's meals and naps on time. Usually, after a day's work, she was tired enough, but she didn't go home first, but went to the nursery to see if the nursery workers had any difficulties and to see if the children were being taken care of well.

    Xue Guifang's enthusiastic care for the nursery was a silent education for Zhou Xizhen. Since she didn't know when, Xue Guifang had become a kind and respectable person in her mind.

    One day, Zhou Xizhen asked Xue Guifang: "There are no children of yours in the nursery, why do you put so much effort into it?"

    Zhou Xizhen didn't expect that this question made Xue Guifang laugh, and she said: "Who said there are no children of mine, those children are yours and mine, they are all the new generation of the country, and they will take over the revolution when they grow up!"

    The short words expressed the breadth of mind of a revolutionary, with the country in mind and the revolution as the most important thing. In contrast, Zhou Xizhen deeply felt that the selfish and self-interested thinking was ugly, and she wanted to completely get rid of the influence brought by her family background.

    At that time, the family members were studying "Serving the People" and "In Memory of Bethune". The lofty images of Zhang Side and Bethune were also educating Zhou Xizhen. She was determined to abandon the word "I" and be a noble person.

    Now, Zhou Xizhen sees taking care of children as doing revolution. She has become the director of the nursery, organizing nursery workers to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everyone's thinking, and turning the nursery into an advanced nursery.

    The revolutionary torrent of Daqing family members not only impacted the family members' thinking, but also impacted the old thinking in the workers. Xue Guifang is a fighter who fights against this old thinking.

    When Yu Jinlan, a family member, began to participate in labor, her husband held her back. At that time, he often took his wife away from the production team, and he would be gone for ten days and a half months. For this reason, Xue Guifang talked to her lover four or five times in a row, hoping that he and his wife would support each other on two fronts. At first, he couldn't figure it out. He said: "It's convenient for my wife to stay by my side and serve me, sewing and washing."

    Soon, the Spring Festival arrived. According to Xue Guifang's suggestion, the production team held a worker-family get-together. The captain reported the progress of the family members in the past year, and also said that the progress of the family members was inseparable from the support of the workers. She expressed her gratitude to the workers for their support on behalf of the production team. That day, the workers came forward to speak one after another, expressing that they would further give the family members more support. Some people even challenged their lovers on the spot, striving to be "Double Five-Goods" in the new year.

    Yu Jinlan's husband hid in the corner, lowered his head, and his face turned red. He couldn't say a word.

    From then on, people saw that Yu Jinlan's husband had changed. He helped his wife cook and take care of the children. The two helped each other, encouraged each other, and made progress together.

    Caring for Class Sisters with Deep Class Feelings

    In the minds of the families of Daqing Oilfield workers, Xue Guifang is the most caring person who understands their sufferings, and everyone affectionately calls her "Our Grandma Xue."

    She asked doctors for family members in the middle of the night and poured dirty water and washed diapers for mothers who had just given birth. When a pregnant woman wanted to eat popcorn, she would take out a basin of corn that she had saved from her own home and quietly place it at the door of the other's home. When a sick woman wanted to eat tofu, she would bring a large basin from afar; if no one fetched water, she would help fetch water; if no one cooked rice, she would help cook rice. If some family members went out, she would take care of the children at home, and she would also feed the chickens.

    Some may say that this is just general neighborhood mutual assistance. No, Xue Guifang's thoughtful care for the surrounding class sisters, with deep class feelings, is out of the needs of the revolution.

    Xie Guixiang, a family member, initially emphasized that her children were young and her housework was busy, and she was unwilling to participate in collective production labor. Xue Guifang persuaded her many times, but she always ignored her.

    When Xie Guixiang was about to give birth to her second child, her husband was not at home, and she was worried that no one would take care of her. Xue Guifang put aside her own housework and went to Guixiang's home with her bedding. She said, "Guixiang, what are you worried about? I'll take care of you." The short words moved Xie Guixiang so much that she didn't know what to do. A few days later, the baby was born. Xue Guifang cooked eggs for her, boiled millet porridge, sewed clothes for the baby, and took care of the older children's meals and sleep. From morning to night, she was busy.

    On the fourth day after the baby was born, Guixiang's husband, Master Suo, returned. When he arrived home and saw that the adults and children were taken care of very well, he said with emotion: "Grandma Xue is so old and takes care of us like this, how can we feel at ease!" Xue Guifang said: "Don't say that, what does this count for! We are all people who suffered in the old society, who wouldn't have some trouble at home." Then she told Master Suo about her past. The year Xue Guifang gave birth to her eldest daughter, she gave birth in the afternoon and was still picking cotton for the landlord in the fields in the morning. On the third day after giving birth, her family had no means of living, and she had to pull herself together and go to work for the landlord. Xue Guifang said: "Now, the revolution has brought us together, and when I see who has difficulties, I can't let it go, and I feel comfortable helping a little."

    The couple was deeply moved by Grandma Xue's words. The man said, "There's nothing to say, I'll work harder in the future." He originally asked for six days off, but only stayed at home for three days before going back to work.

    Xie Guixiang figured out the problem she hadn't figured out for a long time. Soon, she sent her child to the nursery and participated in labor with everyone, joining the ranks of family members' revolutionization.

    Many young family members, like Xie Guixiang, found the correct answers from their own life experiences, and one by one studied Xue Guifang and participated in the production team.

    Handling these household chores such as cooking, taking care of children, sewing and washing, is to reduce the housework burden of workers' families and ensure that they jump out of the small world of the family and participate in collective production labor. This is the practical problem that needs to be solved first. The Daqing Party Committee regards the establishment of canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups as three battles, and mobilized the masses to fight "annihilation warfare". Now, each production team has established year-round nurseries, busy-farming canteens, and sewing groups, so that children are taken care of, meals are cooked, and dirty clothes are washed. In this way, the obstacles to the revolutionization of all oilfield workers' families have been cleared.

    Labor in the Oilfield and Make Revolution for a Lifetime

    The "March 8th" International Women's Day in 1965 is a day that Xue Guifang will never forget. During this festival, she led six representatives of Daqing workers' families and stepped onto the solemn rostrum of the Great Hall of the People to report to the Party and to the women of the capital on the achievements of the Daqing family revolution.

    The conference began. The kind and loud voice of Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, rang in her ears: "The families of Daqing workers are advancing on the road of revolutionization, and they have set a learning example for the families of our workers across the country…"

    Xue Guifang sat on the rostrum, gazing at the solemn and magnificent People's Great Hall, gazing at the brilliant lights on the circular roof, her heart excited almost to jump out.

    At this moment, thunderous applause suddenly broke out in the hall, welcoming her to give a speech. She stood up, looking at the huge portrait of Chairman Mao, feeling very excited. With tears in her eyes, she stepped onto the magnificent rostrum of the motherland and reported on the situation of the Daqing Oilfield workers' family revolution. She said in a voice from the bottom of her heart, "We have a good life, we cannot forget the suffering of the old society, we cannot forget that there are still unliberated people in the world, I will labor in the oilfield for a lifetime and make revolution for a lifetime."

    Thinking about the past, looking at today, and looking forward to the future, how could Xue Guifang not be excited! In the cannibalistic old society, she was running on the brink of starvation all year round, thinking day and night about how to fill her family's stomachs. After liberation, she no longer worried about life, but she just lived in the small world of the family. When she came to Daqing, the Party's call was like a bright light, illuminating her heart. She stepped out of her home, not shunning difficulties and hardships, and walked to the wilderness, leading the families to break a revolutionary path. Later, she read Chairman Mao's books and understood that making revolution is the cause of hundreds of millions of people, so she went to care for the surrounding class sisters with enthusiasm. She honorably joined the Communist Party of China and grew from an ordinary working woman into a revolutionary fighter dedicated to the cause of communism.

    After returning to Daqing from Beijing, Xue Guifang demanded more strictly of herself, guiding her thoughts and actions with Mao Zedong Thought in everything, and leading the workers' family team well with Mao Zedong Thought. She often said to her team members: "Our family members must be like the workers, we must always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, always make revolution, and never be proud. Compared with Wang "Iron Man" and Zhang Hongchi, I am still far behind, I want to learn from Wang "Iron Man" and be an old ox for a lifetime; learn from Zhang Hongchi and be a screw that never rusts!"

    大庆职工家属的标兵——薛桂芳
    点起了油田家属闹革命的第一个火把
    一九六二年春，一个七级大风天。
    茫茫的荒原上，卷起阵阵风沙。一位年近五十的老大娘，带着四名青年妇女，背着三个孩子，扛着五把铁锹，带着一盏煤油灯，挑着行李，踏上了垦荒者的征途，向着荒原深处进发。
    她们，是大庆油田职工家属的首批垦荒者。
    带队的是贫农出身的职工家属薛桂芳。她是两万多名家属当中第一个举起手来，响应大庆油田党委的号召，报名参加集体生产劳动的。
    垦荒的道路是不平坦的。在她们面前，摆着垦荒者所能遇到的一切艰辛。但是，更困难的，还是怎样冲破束缚职工家属投入生产劳动的习惯势力。
    她们踏上征途之前，有些好心肠的人就劝薛桂芳：“哪有职工家属开荒种地的？何况你，儿子姑娘都有工作，老头子也挣钱。该享福了，干啥不行，偏要受那个苦？”
    薛桂芳有她自己的主意。她细声慢语地回答：“这个话看你对谁说。咱在早是受苦人，从小劳动惯了。你别看我这么大年纪，多久也忘不了旧社会受的苦，日子好了也不能守在家里。听党的话去开荒，就是为给社会主义出把力。”
    这五名妇女都没有在这种束缚她们的习惯势力面前退却。
    这一天，她们在漫天的风沙中，迈着艰难的步伐，在荒原中走出了一条路。
    傍晚时分，她们到达了就要开垦的处女地。这里只有石油钻井工人前些时候留下的四根柱子和一堆羊草。她们几个人搭起一个临时安身的棚子，用羊草铺好了地铺。就这样安家落户了。
    第二天清早，她们一人拿起一把铁锹，在荒原上，一锹一锹地翻起了黑油油的泥土。千年沉睡的土地，在她们手下慢慢苏醒了。
    头三天，她们每人手上都打了血泡，结了紫疤。她们开了五亩地。
    薛桂芳垦荒的消息，象一声春雷，在石油工人家属中间传开了。
    跟着又来了十八个家属，她们还借来了一副木犁。
    开头，大伙儿一股热劲儿，用锹挖地，用人拉犁，没有人在困难面前低头。
    一天天过去了，一些在新社会糖水里泡大的青年人，没有经历过这样的艰苦，她们手上打了血泡，浑身累得酸疼，加上有孩子牵累，背地里偷偷嘀咕起来。有些人后悔了，有些人干脆想走回头路，回家讨个清闲。
    原来对家属垦荒抱怀疑态度的人，这时也趁机嚷嚷开了：“我早就料到不行吧！”“家属嘛，在家抱抱孩子，侍候侍候丈夫就行了。”“得了，我一个月拿这么多钱还养活不了你？趁早还是回来吧！”有的干脆把自己的妻子接回去了。
    这样，三个两个地纷纷离开了垦荒队。不到几天，人就走了一大半。剩下的十来个人，思想也不稳定，连她们自己也怀疑家属开荒种地这条路能不能走通了。
    这些日子，薛桂芳心里象压了块石头。剩下的人都眼看着她，等她下决心，拿主意。
    “我就不相信这条路走不通。剩下我一个老婆子也要干到底！”她把手上的伤疤给大家看：“这个伤疤，是我小时候给地主干活被折磨的。有一天，我实在饿了，从地主的狗食盆里，捞起一口小米饭吃，被地主婆发现了。她一棒子打在我头上，把我打倒了，手碰在刀上，留下了这块伤疤。我到死也忘不了它。没有共产党和毛主席，哪有我今天？一想到旧社会受的这些罪，我什么苦都不怕了。”
    薛桂芳的话，深深打动了青年垦荒队员的心。她们表示：“我们永远不能忘记薛妈妈这些话，永远不能忘了老一辈受的阶级苦，我们要象薛妈妈一样，干到底！”
    她们在荒原上坚持下来了。这一年，好不容易开了三十二亩荒地，收了三千多斤粮食。对那些看不起家属参加生产劳动的人来说，这一点地，这一些粮食，的确没有什么大了不起；但是，可贵的是，她们点起了油田家属闹革命的第一个火把。
    大庆油田党委抓住薛桂芳领导的垦荒队这个刚露头的新事物，在全油田职工和家属中大力表扬它，宣传它，推广它，从各方面支持它，使这支革命的火把很快就象燎原的烈火一样扩散开来。整个油田，一个一个家属生产队建立起来了，一个一个工农村建立起来了。
    目前，象薛桂芳她们这样的家属生产队，在大庆油田已有四百多个。一九六五年打了四千多万斤粮食，收了三千多万斤蔬菜，还生产了大量肉、蛋等副食品。她们自己办了托儿所、食堂、缝补组和加工各种食品的作坊，办了半工半读的学校。全矿区有劳动能力的家属，已有百分之九十五参加了集体生产劳动。她们现在想的是集体，爱的是劳动，讲的是勤俭，干的是革命。正如油田职工赞扬她们时说的：“咱们的家属，顶起了半边天。”
    用毛泽东思想武装职工家属的头脑
    薛桂芳生产队的家属来自十几个省市，各人的出身、经历不同，思想上也带着不同的阶级烙印。
    薛桂芳，这个生产队的政治指导员想：要想使家属们乐于参加集体生产劳动，必须用毛泽东思想去改造她们的思想，使她们懂得参加集体生产劳动的革命意义。
    在家属思想革命化的道路上，薛桂芳成了家属们的带路人。
    孙发英，是出身于苏北一个贫农家庭的职工家属。一九六○年来到大庆时，油田刚刚开发，家属还没有组织起来。那时候，左邻右舍，你来我往，谈的全是吃喝穿戴。日久天长，她看不惯的不劳动的生活也看惯了，闲不住的双手也闲住了。她想：嘴巴挂在丈夫的肩头上，他挣钱，我吃饭，这样更舒坦。就这样，她从一九六○年到一九六三年，一直守在家里。
    大庆家属闹革命的浪潮，打破了孙发英“平静”的思想和生活的天地。
    转折是从一个令人难忘的忆苦会开始的。
    那次忆苦会上，薛桂芳向姐妹们讲述了自己解放前苦难的生活经历。她说，那时一家四五口人给地主拼死拼活地干，到头来还是吃不上，穿不上。她丈夫当钻井工人，因工负伤，资本家不仅不给医治，倒反把他开除了。在那暗无天日的年月里，天下穷人的命运，都是一样，比黄连还苦……。
    薛桂芳越讲越沉痛，字字句句有力地扣在姐妹们的心上。孙发英和许多人再也忍不住了，流下了一串串泪珠。
    这一天，孙发英心事如潮，想起了妈妈告诉她的辛酸的家世：她出生那一年，父亲为了一家三口人活命，拖着多病的身体给地主做长工，被折磨死了。
    晚上，丈夫也对她讲起了自己的家世：解放前，苏北平原上的一个大旱之年，他一家老小行乞讨饭，父亲舍不得吃要来的一点点残汤剩饭，活活饿死在海边上。
    一连串辛酸的往事，唤起了孙发英的阶级自觉。这个从小就跟着母亲放牛、种田，直到结婚后还在农村当生产队长的劳动妇女，自问自地说：发英啊发英，你的劳动人民的品质哪里去了？你不觉得不劳动可耻吗？你为啥不牢牢记住：忘掉阶级苦就是忘本，丢掉劳动就是丢掉劳动人民本色这个道理呢？
    第二年一开春，她就参加了家属生产队。她和姐妹们一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，眼界更加开阔了。
    起初，薛桂芳领着大家学习毛主席著作，孙发英说自己一字不识，学不进去。可是，薛桂芳努力学习的榜样，教育了她。
    薛桂芳也是一字不识，但是她没有在困难面前退缩。她拿着毛主席的书，向识字的人请教。夜晚，她经常叫她的小女儿读毛主席著作给她听，有时读到很晚很晚。她，如饥如渴地学习文化，决心冲破横在她和毛主席著作之间的这一关。
    孙发英学着薛妈妈的样子去做，别人阅读，她凑上去听；别人讨论，她也参加。不认识字，就到处请教。
    读了毛主席的书，孙发英觉得心明眼亮。她渐渐懂得了，劳动不劳动，不仅是忘本不忘本的问题，还是革命不革命的问题。当她真正懂得了劳动的意义，她浑身就有使不完的劲。不管干什么，不管活儿多重，她都一股劲儿地往前冲，不知什么叫苦，什么叫累。去年她被选为生产组长，接着又被评上“五好”家属。
    冬英，是另一个类型的青年家属。她是初中毕业生。象许多知识青年一样，她是抱着自己的“理想”到大庆的。她看着汽车司机开着车到处跑，很羡慕；看见仪表工人干活好象很轻松，很自在，也很向往；看见别人在大草原上开拖拉机，觉得很神气，很威武，也要试一试。但是，提到参加农业生产劳动，她却想，这可不是象她那样念了多少年书的人干的。
    她带着个人的打算参加了家属生产队，她想，只要自己表现得好，领导上一定会把自己“拔”出去，介绍一个自己向往的工作。她等待着这一天。
    可是，农业劳动绝不是象她想象的那么轻而易举。锄头，镰刀，不知怎么的，在她手里都好象有千斤重，不听使唤。一垄地，别人已经锄到地头，她才锄到半当腰；收割庄稼，别人已经割完两垄，她一垄还没有割完。
    每当这种时候，总是那个她认为是粗手粗脚没有文化的薛妈妈，来手把手地教她，帮她。薛桂芳帮助她学会了生产技术，薛桂芳热爱农业的思想也深深地感染着她。
    不久，冬英又遇到了一件意外的事。那是在全油田的一次授奖大会上，她们家属生产队竟然和两个先进生产单位同时被命名为“标杆队”。石油工业部领导同志亲手给她们发了奖旗。上级为什么这样重视家属生产劳动？还不是因为家属和职工一样干的是革命事业。这时她想起薛妈妈不止一次地对她讲过，做工、务农，都是革命工作。以前，她对这些话听不进去，现在她有点领悟了。
    冬英开始有点进步，薛妈妈就鼓励她说：“你年轻，有文化，有什么想不通的，就读毛主席的书，看看他老人家是怎么说的，你照着去做就对了。”
    冬英打开毛主席的书，象找到了开心的钥匙。心头上多少疑云被驱散了，脑子里有多少疙瘩被解开了。她学了《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文，挖出了思想上的病根子。她出身在中农家庭，从小心里就埋下了为我为个人的思想种子。原来的“理想”，不正是从个人的想法出发的吗！多丑的思想啊！她决心把自己的前途和革命的需要统一起来，在农业生产上干一场，象薛妈妈那样做一个“人在心也在”的劳动者、革命者。
    职工家属周希珍，出身于商人家庭，小时候跟着父亲做过生意。这给她思想上埋下一个“根子”处处为个人打算盘，想多挣几个钱。来到大庆当初，她就是抱着这种思想对待集体劳动的。
    大庆职工家属的劳动报酬是评工记分，按劳分配。周希珍当保育员，思想上结了个疙瘩：带孩子比干地里活少拿一个工分，算来算去总觉得不合算，不愿意干。
    薛桂芳和周希珍的想法可不一样，她不是保育员，但是她在托儿所孩子身上花的心血，比保育员还多。没到冬天，她就张罗着给托儿所修炉子，封窗户，准备过冬。到了夏天，孩子妈妈下地去了，她又一再提醒保育员按时照顾孩子吃饭，午睡。平时，干完一天活已经够累了，她却不先回家，先到托儿所转一圈，问问保育员工作有没有困难，看看孩子带得好不好。
    薛桂芳热心关怀托儿所，对周希珍来说，是个无声的教育，不知从什么时候起，在她心目里，薛桂芳就成了一位可亲可敬的人物。
    有一天，周希珍问薛桂芳：“托儿所里没有你的孩子，你为什么花那么大的心思呢？”
    周希珍没有想到，这一问把薛桂芳问笑了，她说：“谁说没有我的孩子，那些孩子是你的，也是我的，都是国家的新一代，长大了还要接革命的班哩！”
    简短的话语，表达出一个革命者的胸怀，以国家为怀，以革命为重。对比自己，周希珍深深感到自私自利的思想是丑恶的，要彻底摆脱家庭出身带来的这个影响。
    那时候，家属们正在学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》。张思德、白求恩的崇高形象也教育着周希珍。她决心抛开“我”字，作一个高尚的人。
    现在，周希珍把看孩子看作是在干革命。她已经当了托儿所的所长，组织保育员们学习毛主席著作，用毛主席思想指导大家的思想，把托儿所办成了先进的托儿所。
    大庆家属革命的激流，不仅冲击着家属们的思想翻了个个儿，也冲击着职工中的旧思想。薛桂芳就是向这种旧思想进行斗争的战士。
    家属于金兰开始参加劳动的时候，她的丈夫拖她的后腿。那时候，他常把妻子从生产队带走，一走就是十天半月。为了这，薛桂芳一连找她的爱人谈了四五次话，希望他和妻子在两条战线上相互支持。开始，他有点想不通。他说：“老婆守在身边侍候着，缝补洗涮都方便。”
    不久，春节到了，生产队按照薛桂芳的建议，开了职工联欢会。队长报告了家属们一年来的进步，还说，家属的进步，是和职工们的支持分不开的。她代表生产队对职工们的支持表示感谢。那天，职工们纷纷起来发言，表示要进一步给家属更多的支持。有的人当场还和自己的爱人挑战，争取在新的一年里当“双五好”。
    于金兰的丈夫躲在墙角，低着头，涨红着脸，说不出话来。
    从这以后，人们看到，于金兰的丈夫变了。他帮助爱人做饭，看孩子。两个人互相帮助，互相鼓励，共同进步。
    用深厚的阶级感情关心阶级姐妹
    在大庆油田职工家属的心目里，薛桂芳是最了解她们痛痒的贴心人，大家都亲切地称她是“我们的薛妈妈”。
    她三更半夜替家属请大夫，帮产妇倒脏水，洗尿布。谁家孕妇想吃苞米花，她就拿出一盆自己家里节省下的苞米，悄悄放在人家门口。病妇想豆腐吃，她从老远端来一大盆；没人挑水，她就帮助挑水；没人煮饭，她帮助煮饭。有的家属出门，家里的孩子她给带，家里的小鸡她也给喂。
    也许有人会说，这不过是一般的邻里互助。不，薛桂芳体贴关怀周围的阶级姐妹，她怀着深厚的阶级感情，是出于革命的需要。
    家属谢桂香，起初强调孩子小，家务忙，不愿意参加集体生产劳动。薛桂芳多次劝她，她总是不理睬。
    谢桂香要生第二个孩子的时候，丈夫不在家，愁着没有人照顾。薛桂芳丢开自己的家务，背着铺盖到桂香家去了。她说：“桂香，愁啥？我来侍候你。”简短的话语，感动得谢桂香不知怎么是好。过几天，婴儿生下了。薛桂芳给她煮鸡蛋，熬小米粥，为婴儿缝衣服，照顾大孩子吃饭睡觉。从早到晚，忙个不停。
    婴儿出生的第四天，桂香的丈夫所师傅，回来了。他到家一看，大人小孩都照顾得很好，感动地说：“薛妈妈这么大年纪，这样照顾我们，怎么过意得去呢！”薛桂芳说：“你可别这么说，这算得了啥！咱们都是旧社会的受苦人，谁家还能没有点事儿。”接着她对所师傅讲起她的往事。薛桂芳生大女儿那年，下午生，上午还在地里给地主摘棉花。生下第三天，家里生活无着落，她又不得不强打精神爬起来，给地主去干活。薛桂芳说：“如今，革命把咱们聚到一块儿来，看到谁家有难处，我心里就放不下，帮助做一点，心里才舒坦些。”
    夫妻俩听了薛妈妈这番话，都深深被感动了。男的说：“没啥可说的，往后我更要好好干。”他原来请了六天假，只在家住了三天，就回去工作了。
    谢桂香想通了她好久没有想通的问题。不久，她把孩子送进托儿所，同大家一道参加劳动，加入了家属革命化的行列。
    许多青年家属，也象谢桂香这样，从自己的生活经历中找到了正确答案，一个个都学习薛桂芳，参加了生产队。
    把这些做饭、看孩子、缝补洗涮之类的家务琐事处理好，是减轻职工家属们的家务负担，保证她们跳出家庭小天地，参加集体生产劳动，首先需要解决的实际问题。大庆党委把建立食堂、托儿所、缝补组作为三个战役，发动群众打“歼灭战”。现在，每个生产队都建立了长年托儿所，农忙食堂和缝补组，做到孩子有人带，吃饭有人做，脏衣有人洗。这样，就为全油田的职工家属实现革命化清除了障碍。
    要在油田干一辈子劳动闹一辈子革命
    一九六五年“三八”妇女节，是薛桂芳永远不能忘怀的日子。就在这个节日期间，她带着六名大庆职工家属的代表，走上人民大会堂庄严的讲坛，向党，向首都妇女汇报了大庆家属革命的业绩。
    大会开始了。全国妇联主席蔡畅同志亲切、响亮的声音，在她耳边响着：“大庆职工家属在革命化的道路上前进，她们为我们全国职工家属，树立了学习的榜样。……”
    薛桂芳坐在主席台上，凝视着这庄严雄伟的人民大厦，凝视着圆形屋顶上灿烂的灯光，她的心兴奋得几乎要跳了出来。
    这时，全场突然响起了雷鸣般的掌声，欢迎她给大家讲话。她站起来，端详着毛主席的巨幅画象，心里非常激动。她含着热泪，迈上祖国雄伟的讲坛，汇报了大庆油田职工家属闹革命的情况。她用发自内心的声音讲道，“我们过了好日子，不能忘了旧社会的苦，不能忘了世界上还有没解放的人民，我要在油田上干一辈子劳动，闹一辈子革命。”
    想想过去，看看今天，展望未来，薛桂芳怎么能不激动啊！在吃人的旧社会，她终年奔波在饥饿线上，日思夜想的是怎样才能填饱一家人的肚子。解放了，她不再为生活操心了，但是她只是生活在家庭的小天地里。到了大庆，党的号召象一盏明灯，照亮了她的心，她迈出家门，不避艰难困苦，向大荒原走去，带领家属们闯出了一条革命化的道路。以后，她读毛主席的书，懂得了干革命是千百万群众自己的事业，就满怀热情地去关怀周围的阶级姐妹。她光荣地参加了中国共产党，从一个普通的劳动妇女成长为一个献身于共产主义事业的革命战士了。
    从北京回到大庆后，薛桂芳更加严格要求自己，处处以毛泽东思想指导自己的思想和行动，用毛泽东思想带好职工家属队伍。她常对队员们说：“我们家属要同职工一样，要永远听党和毛主席的话，永远革命，永不骄傲。我跟王‘铁人’、张洪池相比，还差得很远，我要学习王‘铁人’，作一辈子老黄牛；学习张洪池，当一颗永不生锈的螺丝钉！”
