    Seeing the Light Again
    Based on the narration of Fang Yongxiu, Packaging Section Chief of Jining Match Factory, compiled and drawn by Ding Ningyuan
    Editor's Note: In a class society, the liberation of the individual always depends on the liberation of the class. The sequential pictures "Seeing the Light Again" and the sketch "The World Transformed" published here vividly and concretely illustrate this truth. The experience of female worker Fang Yongxiu depicted in the "Seeing the Light Again" sequential pictures is the epitome of the lives of the Chinese working class in the old and new societies.
    Without understanding class oppression and exploitation, one cannot understand the true meaning of revolution. Therefore, reflecting class struggle and exposing the evil nature of the bourgeoisie through our literary and artistic works, educating the people to care about the revolutionary cause, and carrying the revolution through to the end have become very important tasks for our literary and artistic workers.
    Based on this requirement, Shandong art workers went deep into factories and rural areas, collected a large amount of material reflecting class oppression from workers and peasants, and created a batch of art works with class education as their content. The "Seeing the Light Again" sequential pictures are one of them. (Attached pictures)
    1　My hometown is in Weishan County, Shandong Province. When I was eight years old, I followed my mother to Jining to escape the famine. When I was thirteen, due to financial difficulties, my mother reluctantly found me a husband's family.
    2　My husband's family was as poor as my own, so they asked someone to introduce me to work at Zhenye Match Factory (the predecessor of Jining Match Factory). The capitalists stipulated: work starts at four o'clock in the morning; being three minutes late results in half a day's wage being deducted. Poor families didn't have clocks, so they had to wait at the factory gate in the middle of the night.
    3　Working from four o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock in the evening, the wages for these sixteen or seventeen hours couldn't even buy a pound of red sorghum. The workers worked on empty stomachs and often fainted in the workshop.
    4　Because of the exhaustion and dirt, plus the smoke, I got an eye disease. The hateful capitalist made fun of me and actually used iodine as eye drops, dripping it into my eyes. It hurt so much that I rolled on the ground, but that beast laughed beside me.
    5　Once, the capitalist's dog was running around in the yard with a steamed bun in its mouth. I glanced at it, and he cursed at me: "Poor wretch, wait for the dog to shit it out before you eat it!" After saying that, he took a bamboo stick and whipped my face.
    6　The capitalist's children were pampered, but workers weren't allowed to go home to breastfeed their children. My third child died of cold and hunger! After the child died, his father got dysentery, and because we didn't have money to buy medicine, we watched him breathe his last.
    7　After my child's father died, life became even harder. At this time, I went completely blind. The capitalist exploited me like this and then fired me. Heavens! A blind person like me couldn't even find the door to beg for food!
    8　There was only one way to go: to my death. I asked my eldest child to lead me to the old Grand Canal. I said, "I can feel the place now, you go back!" The child hugged me desperately and said, "Mom! You can't die! If you die, who will take care of me and my younger brother..."
    9　Just when I was at the end of my rope, like a thunderclap from a clear sky, Jining City was liberated in 1948. The Communist Party came, and the people's savior, Chairman Mao's troops, came. From then on, I, like all the sufferers, stood up and became masters of our own destiny.
    10　The Party and the government first arranged for my livelihood and then invited famous doctors everywhere to treat my eyes. In less than two years, my eyes were cured. When I saw the light again, it was like a dream; everything in the world had changed.
    11　I went back to work at the Jining Match Factory. In 1953, I joined the Party. In 1958, I was promoted to section chief. In 1963, I attended the Shandong Provincial Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction. For the cause of the Party, I work diligently.
    12　I actively pass on my skills to new workers and encourage them to work hard. Therefore, for many years, our workshop has completed the production tasks assigned by the Party on time.
    13　I study culture and read Chairman Mao's books. Whenever I encounter difficulties in my work, I consult Chairman Mao's works. The more I study, the clearer my heart becomes, and the more energy I have for my work.
    14　In our factory, there is still a house where capitalists used to beat workers - the "Teaching Room". I often take young workers to see it, teaching them not to forget the bitterness of the class. At the same time, I encourage young people to listen to the Party and be revolutionary successors who will never change their color.

    重见光明
    根据济宁市火柴厂包装工段段长  房永秀口述  丁宁原编绘
    编者按：在阶级社会里，个人的解放总是有赖于阶级的解放。这里刊登的《重见光明》连环画和《换了人间》速写，生动而具体地说明这一真理。《重见光明》连环画中所描写的女工房永秀的遭遇，就是我国工人阶级在新旧社会生活的缩影。
    不懂得阶级的压迫和剥削，就不懂得革命的真正意义。因此，通过我们的文艺作品，来反映阶级斗争和揭露资产阶级的罪恶本质，教育人民关心革命事业，将革命进行到底，就成为我们文艺工作者一项很重要的任务。
    山东的美术工作者根据这一要求，深入到工厂农村，在工人、农民中收集了大量的反映阶级压迫的素材，创作了一批以阶级教育为内容的美术作品。《重见光明》连环画，是其中的一套。（附图片）
    1　我老家在山东省微山县。八岁那年，跟妈逃荒到济宁。我十三岁时，因生活困难，妈忍痛给我找了个婆家。
    2　婆家和娘家一样穷，后来就托人介绍我到振业火柴厂（济宁市火柴厂前身）当工人。资本家规定：早四点钟上班，迟到三分钟扣半天工资。穷人家没有钟表，半夜三更就得到厂门口去等候。
    3　从早晨四点一直干到晚上九点，这一天十六、七个钟头的工资还买不了一斤红高粱。工人们饿着肚子干活，常常晕倒在车间。
    4　因为又累又脏，加上烟熏，我害了眼病。可恨的资本家拿我开心，竟把碘酒当眼药，给我滴在眼里，疼得我满地打滚，这畜生却在旁边大笑。
    5　有一次，资本家的狗叼着馒头在院子里跑，我瞧了一眼，把头就破口大骂：“穷骨头，等狗拉下来再给你吃吧！”说完拿竹条就往我脸上抽打。
    6　资本家的孩子娇生惯养，却不叫工人回家给孩子吃奶。我的第三个孩子就这样连冻带饿死了！孩子死了，他爹又得了痢疾，因为没有钱买药，也眼睁睁地看着他断了气。
    7　孩子他爹一死，日子更难过了。就在这时，我一双眼睛全瞎了。资本家把我剥削成这样子，反把我开除了。天哪！我一个双眼瞎子，要饭也找不到门啊！
    8　只有走绝路了。我叫我的大孩子领我到老运河边上。我说：“我能摸到地方了，你回去吧！”孩子没命地抱着我说：“娘！你不能死啊！你死了，谁来管我和弟弟……”
    9　正当走投无路的时候，平地一声雷，一九四八年济宁市解放了。共产党来了，人民救星毛主席的队伍来了。从此，我和所有受苦人一样，都翻身当家做了主人。
    10　党和政府首先给我安排了生活，又到处请名医为我治眼，不到两年，我一双眼就治好了。当我重见光明的时候，真象作了一场梦，世界上一切都变了。
    11　我重新走进济宁火柴厂工作。一九五三年我入了党，一九五八年我被提拔为工段长，一九六三年出席了山东省社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会。为了党的事业，我辛勤地工作着。
    12　我把技术积极传授给新工人，并鼓励他们好好干活。因此，我们的车间，多年来，都按时完成党交给的生产任务。
    13　我一边学文化，一边读毛主席的书，工作中有了困难就向毛主席著作请教。真是越学心里越亮堂，越学工作越有劲。
    14　在我们厂里，还保留着一个过去资本家打工人的房子——“教习室”，我常领着年青工人去看，教他们不忘阶级苦。同时我勉励青年人要听党的话，做永不变色的革命接班人。
