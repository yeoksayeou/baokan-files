    Comrades, have you ever thought about it: Every day, just as dawn is breaking, when people are still sound asleep, on those cloud-shrouded snowy mountains, there is a border guard, single-mindedly and intently cranking a motor, non-stop. Every day is like this, over a thousand "every days" have been like this!
    This border guard is named Ning Xiaohua. He is a machine operator in the "Plateau Red Border Defense Team," a five-good soldier model.
              ※
    One snowy night, inside a bunker of the border defense team, the new machine operator Ning Xiaohua laboriously cranked the motor. He cranked and cranked, as snow swirled outside the bunker; inside, Ning Xiaohua was drenched in sweat.
    Radio Station Chief Wang Chengyou turned around, looked at Ning Xiaohua, and said considerately: "Xiao Ning, are you tired!"
    Ning Xiaohua smiled honestly and said: "Not tired, I'm used to laboring at home."
      "Used to laboring at home" – these words, coming from the mouth of a poor peasant's son, are so simple, so warm! But, as a revolutionary soldier, just having this simple feeling is not enough; one should also understand more, deeper revolutionary principles. The station chief said meaningfully: "Xiao Ning, tell me, why do we have to get up in this snowy night to crank the motor and send telegrams?"
      "Why? For our team!" Xiao Ning blurted out.
      "It's for our team, but not just for our team."
    The station chief's words attracted Xiao Ning. He honestly asked: "Not just for our team? For whom else?"
      "For the revolution." The station chief's eyes gleamed: "Xiao Ning, you are cranking the motor for the revolution!"
      "Cranking the motor for the revolution?" Xiao Ning blinked his big eyes.
      "Yes, cranking the motor for the revolution! Think about it, if it weren't for the revolution, who would run up to this snowy mountain top at over five thousand meters? If it weren't for the revolution, who would brave the wind and snow to get up in the middle of the night to crank the motor? If no one in our border defense team cranked the motor, how could we promptly report to the motherland? How could we promptly hear the orders from the Party and the motherland? And how could we satisfactorily complete the task of guarding the border?"
    Cranking the motor for the revolution! How powerful these words are! The veterans of the Red Army marched twenty-five thousand li, climbing snowy mountains and crossing grasslands, for the revolution; the "Old Tibetans" marched into Tibet, eating wild herbs and digging up ground squirrels, for the revolution; now, he himself is cranking the motor on this snowy mountain, also for the revolution! Ning Xiaohua thought of this, and with an admiring heart, said to the station chief: "When will I be able to understand so many great principles like you do? I'd laugh in my sleep!"
    The station chief smiled. He took out a book and said to Ning Xiaohua: "Originally, I didn't understand anything, but it, taught me to understand revolutionary principles. Here, study it."
    Xiao Ning looked at the book. This was a golden, shining book! This was a book written by Chairman Mao himself! He stretched out his hands and took the book. Holding the book, he stepped out of the bunker, looked up, and in the icy peaks and snowy sea, a red sun was breaking through the clouds and rising slowly…
              ※
    This day, Ning Xiaohua was concentrating on transcribing quotations from Chairman Mao.
    The radio's alarm clock rang; it was almost time to crank the motor. Xiao Ning put down the book, gripped the crank handle, and started cranking vigorously.
    Xiao Ning's hand kept turning, and the motor hummed happily. A flashing thought rose in Xiao Ning's heart: Our Chairman Mao said that we should choose the heaviest loads to carry; how great it would be if I could shoulder the heavy task of cranking the motor for two people!
    Xiao Ning told the station chief his idea.
    The station chief looked at Xiao Ning and said with affection:
  "On such a high snowy mountain, cranking the motor with two people is already a heavy burden, how can one person do it?"
    Xiao Ning said: "Cranking the motor alone will be more tiring; but, if one person is freed up to go to the squad, one more person can stand guard, which can reduce everyone's burden!"
    From that day on, Xiao Ning single-handedly shouldered the heavy burden of two people. On this snowy mountain at an altitude of over five thousand meters, if two people take turns cranking, they can still switch hands. Now, Ning Xiaohua actually started cranking alone.
    To persist in such arduous labor, physical strength alone is not enough. More importantly, it depends on Mao Zedong Thought, on revolutionary perseverance!
    One bitterly cold winter night, the temperature dropped to minus twenty-four degrees Celsius. In the middle of the night, as soon as the radio's alarm clock rang, Ning Xiaohua crawled out of bed and immediately started cranking the motor. The weather was cold, and coupled with the high-altitude oxygen deficiency, cranking the motor was very strenuous. At this moment, Ning Xiaohua remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Work is struggle!" Yes, work is struggle! Cranking the motor on the snowy mountain means struggling against the wind and snow! Struggling against the high-altitude oxygen deficiency! Struggling against fatigue! Thinking of this, a warm current flowed through his whole body. He gripped the crank handle tightly and cranked vigorously!
    In the sound of the motor cranking, a year, two years passed; in the sound of the motor cranking, more than a thousand days and nights passed. Xiao Ning studied Chairman Mao's works while cranking the motor. The more he cranked, the more energetic his hand became; the more he studied, the redder his heart became.
              ※
    Moonlight shone through the glass, illuminating Ning Xiaohua. He was reading a letter from home under the lamp.
    Ning Xiaohua had been in the army for more than three years. His mother had found him a partner in his hometown. The girl herself was willing, and Ning Xiaohua's parents were also happy. But the girl made a condition: Ning Xiaohua had to go back to meet her in person before they could get engaged. This condition was not high: Overstaying veterans were allowed to ask for leave to go back for engagement; besides, after being away from home for more than three years, Xiao Ning also wanted to ask for leave to go back and see his white-haired parents. However, with the invaders firing shots today and crossing the border to provoke tomorrow, how could a border guard leave his battle post at this time?
    Xiao Ning studied Chairman Mao's works whenever he had a problem. He opened the book: "A Communist Party member should be open and frank, loyal, active, putting the interests of the revolution first and foremost, subordinating personal interests to the interests of the revolution." Yes, although he was not yet a Communist Party member, he was a member of the Communist Youth League and should learn from the Party members, putting the interests of the revolution first and foremost. Cranking the motor at the border post is a revolutionary interest; going back for engagement is a personal interest. Personal interests should be subordinate to the interests of the revolution!
    Ning Xiaohua excitedly picked up his pen and wrote a letter to his mother. He explained the great principle that the interests of the revolution are the first priority to his mother. He also specially told his mother that these words were said by Chairman Mao. He told his mother that in the past, for the revolution, the veterans of the Red Army did not go home for ten or twenty years. Now, for the revolution, what does it matter if I delay my engagement for a few years!
    Soon, Ning Xiaohua's mother replied. The letter said, child, you did the right thing. In the old society, we poor peasants couldn't afford to eat or wear, and suffered so much! Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came and we lived a good life. Do as Chairman Mao says.
    Looking at his mother's letter, Xiao Ning was extremely happy. Chairman Mao! Your words are so effective! You educated me, and also educated my mother. Chairman Mao's book is truly the guiding light for the working people of the world!
              ※
    Autumn, this was the fourth autumn that Ning Xiaohua had come to the plateau.
    This day, Ning Xiaohua had just gotten up when the team gave him a task: to take the instructor to another place for a meeting.
    This task was so fresh for Ning Xiaohua! Having come to the snowy mountain for four years, he had not left the snowy mountain in four years, had not taken off his cotton-padded coat, had not seen the fields, nor had he seen the villages. Now, to go to this rich semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, how could he not be excited!
    Ning Xiaohua took the instructor to his destination, stayed for only one night, and returned to the garrison the next day. This business trip of Xiao Ning's was not an ordinary business trip! For Xiao Ning, who had lived on the snowy mountain for more than a thousand days and nights, it was simply a "ceremony"! It was the most vivid and practical political lesson. With excitement, he said to his comrades: "The Young Pioneers there are so much like my younger brothers and sisters! The Tibetan Abba and Ama there are so much like my parents. For the Tibetan people, for the people of the whole country, for the people of the whole world, I am willing to work on the snowy mountain for the rest of my life!" Through studying Chairman Mao's works, Ning Xiaohua gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    At this time, some of the soldiers who enlisted with Ning Xiaohua had become platoon leaders, and some had become deputy instructors. Ning Xiaohua, on the other hand, was still a machine operator. Someone said to him: "Look, after five years of service, you are still a machine operator!"
    Ning Xiaohua raised his head and said proudly: "Cranking the machine is also doing revolution! Doing revolution is not for fame or status, but to serve the people! As long as the revolution needs it, I am willing to crank the machine on the snowy mountain for the rest of my life!"

    雪山千日摇机声
    杨星火
    同志们啊，你可曾想到：每天，天快亮的时候，人们正睡得香甜的时候，在那云雾缭绕的雪山上，有一位边防战士，正在一刻不停、聚精会神地摇着马达。每天都是这样，一千多个“每天”，都是这样啊！
    这位边防战士，名叫宁孝华。他是“高原红色边防队”的摇机员，五好战士标兵。
              ※
    在一个风雪的夜晚，在边防队的地堡里，新来的摇机员宁孝华，吃力地摇着马达。摇啊，摇啊，地堡外大雪纷飞；地堡内，宁孝华满头大汗。
    电台台长汪成友回过头来，望了望宁孝华，体贴地说：“小宁，累了吧！”
    宁孝华憨厚地笑了笑，说：“不累，在家劳动惯了。”
      “在家劳动惯了”，这话，从一个贫农的儿子口里说出来，多么朴素，多么亲切啊！可是，作为一个革命战士，光有这种朴素的感情，还不够；还应该懂得更多、更深的革命道理。台长意味深长地说：“小宁，你说，我们为什么要在这风雪夜里，起来摇机、发报？”
      “为什么？为了我们队嘛！”小宁冲口而出。
      “是为了我们队，又不仅是为了我们队。”
    台长的话，吸引了小宁。他老老实实地问：“不仅是为我们队？还为哪个哟！”
      “为了革命。”台长眼里闪着光采：“小宁啦，你是在为革命摇机呀！”
      “为革命摇机？”小宁忽闪着一双大眼睛。
      “是啊，为革命摇机！你想想，要不是为了革命，谁跑到这五千多米的雪山顶上来？要不是为了革命，谁冒着风雪半夜起来摇机？咱们边防队没有人摇机，怎能及时向祖国汇报？怎能及时听到党和祖国的命令？又怎能圆满地完成守卫边防的任务？”
    为革命摇机！这话多有劲儿！老红军万里长征，爬雪山、过草地，是为了革命；“老西藏”进军西藏，吃野菜、挖地老鼠，是为了革命；如今，自己在这雪山上摇马达，也是为了革命！宁孝华想到这，他怀着羡慕的心情，对台长说：“什么时候，我要能象你一样，懂得那么些大道理，我睡着都会笑醒罗！”
    台长笑了。他拿出一本书，对宁孝华说：“本来，我什么也不懂，是它，教我懂得了革命道理。给你，学吧。”
    小宁望着那本书，这是一本金光闪闪的书！这是毛主席亲笔写的书啊！他伸出双手，接过了这本书。他捧着书，跨出地堡，举眼一看，冰峰雪海中，一轮红日正冲云破雾，冉冉升起……
              ※
    这天，宁孝华正在全神贯注地抄写毛主席语录。
    电台的闹钟响了，快到摇机的时候了。小宁放下书，手握摇柄，用劲地摇起来。
    小宁的手不停地转动着，马达呜呜地欢唱着。一个闪光的念头，从小宁心中升起：咱们的毛主席说啦，担子要拣重的挑；这两个人的摇机重担，我一个人挑起来，那有多好！
    小宁把自己的想法，告诉了台长。
    台长望着小宁，爱惜地说：
  “在这么高的雪山上，两个人摇机，担子就够重了，一个人摇怎么行？”
    小宁说：“一个人摇机，是要累些；可是，抽出一个人到班里去，多一个人站岗，就可以减轻大家的负担啊！”
    从这天起，小宁一个人挑起了两个人的重担。在这海拔五千多米的雪山上摇机，两个人轮流摇，还可以换换手。如今，宁孝华竟一个人摇开了。
    要坚持这样的艰苦劳动，光凭体力是不行的。更重要的是凭毛泽东思想，凭革命毅力！
    一个严寒的冬夜，气温下降到零下二十四度。半夜，电台的闹钟一响，宁孝华从被窝里钻出来，立刻开始摇机，天气寒冷，再加上高山缺氧，摇机非常吃力。就在这个时候，宁孝华想起了毛主席的话：“工作就是斗争！”对呀，工作就是斗争！在雪山上摇机，就要向风雪作斗争！向高山缺氧作斗争！向疲劳作斗争！想到这里，一股暖流流过全身。他握紧机柄，呼呼地摇开了！
    在摇机声中，一年、两年过去了；在摇机声中，一千多个日夜过去了。小宁一面摇机，一面学毛主席著作。越摇，手越有劲；越学，心越红。
              ※
    月光透过玻璃，照着宁孝华。他正在灯下看家信。
    宁孝华入伍已经三年多了。妈妈在家乡为他找了个对象。姑娘本人情愿，宁孝华的爹妈也乐意。可是，姑娘提了个条件：要宁孝华回去见一面，才能定亲。这个条件，本来不高：超期服役的老兵，请假回去定个亲，也是准许的；再说，离家三年多了，小宁也想请假回去，看看白发的爹娘。可是，侵略者今天开枪，明天越境挑衅，一个边防战士，怎能在这个时候离开战斗岗位？
    小宁有问题就学毛主席著作，他翻开书：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。对呀，自己虽然还不是共产党员，却是一个共青团员，应该向党员看齐，以革命利益为第一生命。在边防哨卡摇机，这是革命利益；回去定亲，这是个人利益。个人利益应该服从革命利益嘛！
    宁孝华兴奋地提起笔来，给妈妈写了封信。他把革命利益是第一生命的大道理，讲给妈妈听。他还特地告诉妈妈，这话是毛主席说的。他对妈妈说，过去，为了革命，老红军十年二十年都没回家。如今，为了革命，我晚几年定亲，又算得什么呢！
    不久，宁孝华的妈妈回信了。信上说，孩子，你做得对。旧社会我们贫农吃不上，穿不上，受了多少苦啊！毛主席、共产党来了，我们才过上了好日子。毛主席怎么说，你就怎么做吧。
    望着妈妈的来信，小宁高兴极了。毛主席呀！你的话真灵啦！你教育了我，还教育了我的妈妈。毛主席的书，真是天下劳动人民的指路明灯啊！
              ※
    秋天，这是宁孝华来到高原的第四个秋天。
    这天，宁孝华刚刚起床，队里交给他一个任务：送指导员去另一个地方开会。
    这个任务对宁孝华是多么新鲜啊！来到雪山上四年了，四年来，他没有离开过雪山，没有脱下过棉袄，没有看过田野，也没见过村庄。如今，要到这富饶的半农半牧区去，怎不叫人兴奋啊！
    宁孝华送指导员到了目的地，只住了一夜，第二天他就返回驻地。这一次小宁去出差，不是一次普通的出差啊！这对在雪山上住了一千多个日夜的小宁，简直是一次“观礼”！是一堂最生动、最实际的政治课。他怀着激动的心情，对战友说：“那里的红领巾，多象自己的弟妹！那里的藏族阿爸、阿妈，多象自己的爹娘。为了西藏人民，为了全国人民，为了全世界人民，我愿在雪山上干一辈子！”通过学习毛主席著作，宁孝华光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    这时，和宁孝华一起入伍的战士，有的当了排长，有的当了副指导员。宁孝华呢，还是一个摇机员。有人对他说：“你看，当了五年兵，还是个摇机员！”
    宁孝华昂起头，自豪地说：“摇机也是干革命嘛！干革命，不是图名誉地位，是为人民服务！只要革命需要，我愿在雪山上摇一辈子机！”
