Title: Argument in a Dead End

    The debate in the U.S. Congress surrounding the policy of aggression against Vietnam continues to develop, greatly unsettling the Johnson administration. The "New York Times" said that "the battle (referring to the debate) in Washington" "shows disturbing signs that mean disaster."

    This unprecedentedly fierce dispute within the U.S. ruling clique reflects the serious failure of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. If U.S. imperialism were not at a dead end in the quagmire of the war of aggression against Vietnam, facing numerous difficulties, how could such fierce mutual squabbling, mutual attacks, and mutual blaming have occurred within the U.S. ruling clique? In particular, in this great debate, the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam has been besieged by many members of Congress, and Johnson's repeated defenses have failed to quell the dispute. This further illustrates that the U.S. ruling clique has no confidence in whether it can rely on expanding the war to find a way out of the predicament.

    Of course, the clamorous arguments in the U.S. Congress are nothing more than disputes over how to maintain the U.S. ruling position in South Vietnam. As history has repeatedly proven, although the imperialist reactionaries have countless contradictions, they are always consistent on the point of counter-revolution. Despite the clamor within the U.S. ruling clique, it will not change its basic policy of aggression against Vietnam.

    However, in any case, as the United States continues to "gradually escalate" in the war of aggression against Vietnam and suffer further defeats, the contradictions within the U.S. ruling clique are bound to deepen further, and more disputes will inevitably occur between various factions. The corruption and weakness of U.S. imperialism are also fully reflected in this regard.

### 在死胡同里的争吵

    在死胡同里的争吵
    美国国会围绕侵越政策而进行的辩论，还在继续发展，约翰逊政府大为不安。《纽约时报》说，“在华盛顿进行的战斗（指辩论）”，“表现出令人不安的意味着灾难的迹象”。
    美国统治集团内部爆发的这场空前激烈的争吵，反映了美国侵越战争的严重失败。如果不是美帝国主义在侵越战争的泥潭里走投无路，困难重重，美国统治集团内部又何至于会发生如此激烈的互相争吵、互相攻讦、互相埋怨？特别是，在这场大辩论中，约翰逊政府的侵越政策受到了许多议员们的围攻，约翰逊一再为自己辩护，也无法把争吵平息下去。这就更加说明了，美国统治集团内部对于是否能够依靠扩大战争来找到挽救败局的出路，也是毫无信心的。
    当然，美国国会中七嘴八舌的争吵，无非是争论怎样才能维持美国在南越的统治地位。正如历史一再证明了的，帝国主义反动派虽然矛盾百出，但是在反革命这一点上面总是一致的。尽管美国统治集团内部吵吵嚷嚷，它是不会改变侵略越南的基本政策的。
    但是，不管怎么样，随着美国在侵越战争中的继续“逐步升级”，进一步遭到失败，美国统治集团内部的矛盾也必然要进一步加深，各种派系之间势将会发生更多的争吵。美帝国主义的腐朽性和虚弱性，在这方面也充分反映出来。
