    Deep Class Feelings Bring About a High Degree of Awareness
    Shandong Workers, Peasants, and Masses Study Chairman Mao's Works and Apply What They Learn
    Party Organizations at All Levels in the Province Promote and Guide the Masses in the Living Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works Based on Actual Conditions
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th) The broad masses of grassroots cadres and workers and peasants in Shandong Province have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works, promoting ideological revolutionization and driving forward industrial and agricultural production. Some elderly peasants say they want to treat Chairman Mao's books as the best “family heirlooms.”
    The movement of grassroots cadres and workers and peasants studying Chairman Mao's works has developed step by step, from cadres to activists, and from activists to the broad masses. According to statistics from sixteen counties in five prefectures, nearly 70,000 study groups of Chairman Mao's works have already been organized. According to a survey of 709 brigades in some counties, about 90 percent of the brigades have organized studies of Chairman Mao's works, of which 38 percent are doing a relatively good job of learning and applying them in a living way.
    Among the grassroots cadres and workers and peasants, the articles studied the most, remembered the most deeply, and applied the best are "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Many people, when they have ideological problems, think of Zhang Side and automatically examine themselves; when dealing with people and affairs with selfishness, think of Bethune, and the idea of "public" prevails; when encountering difficulties in their work, think of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and their revolutionary spirit is encouraged, greatly increasing their enthusiasm. Many quotations from Chairman Mao's books have become their criteria for transforming their thinking, distinguishing right from wrong, observing problems, and guiding their actions.
    The workers and peasants study Chairman Mao's works with profound and strong class feelings, believing that Chairman Mao's books speak their "inner thoughts," are "books that speak for the laboring people," and "books for making revolution." In their studies, they are most easily reminded of the past suffering, appreciate today's sweetness, and are filled with hope for the future. They accept and understand Chairman Mao's books quickly and deeply. They say that many of Chairman Mao's viewpoints are understood with one mention and clarified with one point. Therefore, they have a high degree of consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works. Many people, although with low levels of education or even little literacy, are not daunted by this. They say: "A dull knife fears constant sharpening, and lack of understanding fears many readings." Li Zhanyuan, an oil pressing worker in Boxing County, only knows about 300 characters. He holds Chairman Mao's works in one hand and checks the dictionary in the other, persisting in studying every day. Not only has he studied Chairman Mao's works deeply and applied them well, but he has also learned more than 2,000 characters and written more than 450 study notes and diaries. The greatest characteristic and greatest advantage of workers and peasants studying Chairman Mao's works is that they apply what they learn immediately, with immediate results. Chen Lanhua, director of the Women's Congress of the Xishuyuan Brigade of the Shuyuan Commune in Junan County, said: "Studying is for the sake of application, and there is no need to study if it is not applied!" After studying "On Practice," she led women to plant large experimental fields. Li Dexun, a barber in Jinan, originally thought that barbering was "something that cannot be seen," but after studying Chairman Mao's works, he raised his awareness, worked outstandingly, and is now a model barber.
    In the past year, the main methods adopted by party organizations at all levels in Shandong to lead grassroots cadres and workers and peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works are:
    1. Grasp living study and application. Various localities use the method of "following the task, seizing the opportunity, and watching the development" to promote the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Following the task means studying Chairman Mao's relevant works whenever there is a current task. For example, when carrying out the drought resistance struggle, study Chairman Mao's works on striving for strength, self-reliance, daring to revolutionize, and thoroughly revolutionizing. Seizing the opportunity means discovering living thoughts from different tasks, different work links, and different events, seizing the opportunity to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. When work has achieved results and it is easy to generate complacency, study discussions on "one divides into two," "modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind," etc. When signs of disunity appear, study "Combat Liberalism." Watching the development means mastering the changes in ideological conditions with the development of struggle tasks and constantly studying Chairman Mao's works.
    2. Proceeding from the actual conditions of the masses, organize studies by differentiating different objects, different seasons, and different units. For example, in the busy farming season, use more forms of studying in the fields, individual study, family study, and meeting study. In the slack farming season, study in party schools, youth league schools, and folk schools, or in work teams and clubs.
    3. Vigorously grasp typical examples and establish models for the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and various regions and departments have held experience exchange meetings on studying Chairman Mao's works, establishing a large number of typical examples and promoting the study movement.
    4. Do a good job of tutoring in studying Chairman Mao's works. Tutoring teams have been widely established throughout the province. A large number of tutoring materials have also been published throughout the province.
    Various places in Shandong have also paid special attention to grasping the study of grassroots party branch secretaries. Some prefectural and county party committees have also helped them study Chairman Mao's works by transferring grassroots cadres to take turns entering party schools, studying during meetings, and studying when deploying and inspecting work.
    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee believes that the activities of grassroots cadres and workers and peasants studying Chairman Mao's works are developing very unevenly, and not many have truly learned well. In particular, leadership work has not kept up, lagging behind the masses and lagging behind the situation. This year, in addition to continuing to grasp the study of "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" by grassroots cadres and workers and peasants, various places must also study Chairman Mao's works and quotations on classes and class struggle, firmly establish the idea of war preparedness and the viewpoint of class struggle, carry out the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, invigorate revolutionary spirit, take the Dazhai road, develop agricultural production, and build new socialist countryside.

### 深厚的阶级感情带来高度的自觉性  山东工农群众学毛主席著作学了就用

    深厚的阶级感情带来高度的自觉性
    山东工农群众学毛主席著作学了就用
    全省各级党组织从实际出发推动和辅导群众活学活用毛主席著作
    据新华社济南二十八日电  山东省广大基层干部和工农群众认真学习毛主席著作，促进了思想革命化，推动了工农业生产。有些老年农民说，他们要把毛主席的书当作最好的
  “传家宝”。
    基层干部和工农群众学习毛主席著作的运动，是由干部到积极分子，由积极分子到广大群众，一步一步发展起来的。据五个专区的十六个县统计，已经组织起学习毛主席著作小组将近七万个。根据在一部分县的七百零九个大队调查了解，有组织地学习毛主席著作的大队占百分之九十左右，其中活学活用比较好的大队占百分之三十八。
    基层干部和工农群众学习毛主席著作，学得最多、记得最深、用得最好的是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》三篇文章。许多人思想上有了毛病，想起了张思德，就自动检查自己；对人处事有了私心，想起了白求恩，为“公”的思想就占了上风；工作中遇到了困难，想起了《愚公移山》，革命精神就鼓舞起来，干劲大增。毛主席书中的许多语录，成了他们改造思想、明辨是非、观察问题、指导行动的准则。
    工农群众学习毛主席著作，有深厚、强烈的阶级感情，认为毛主席的书说出了他们的“心里话”，是“替劳动人民说话的书”、“闹革命的书”，在学习中最能叫他们想起过去的苦，体会到今日的甜，对未来充满希望。他们对毛主席的书接受快，领会深。他们说，毛主席的许多论点一提就懂，一点就明。因此，他们学习毛主席著作有高度的自觉性。许多人虽然文化程度较低，甚至识字很少，并不因此被难倒。他们说：“心钝就怕工夫磨，不懂就怕遍数多”。博兴县榨油工人李占元，只识三百来字，他一手拿毛主席著作，一手查字典，天天坚持学习，不但毛主席著作学得深，用得好，还认了两千多字，写了四百五十多篇学习笔记和日记。工农群众学习毛主席著作的最大特点和最大优点是学了就用，立竿见影。莒南县书院公社西书院大队妇代会主任陈兰花说：“学就是为了用，不用就不必学了！”她学习《实践论》，就带领妇女大种试验田。济南理发员李德训，原来认为理发“见不得人”，学习毛主席著作，提高了觉悟，工作很出色，现在成为模范理发员。
    近一年来，山东各级党组织领导基层干部和工农群众学习毛主席著作的主要做法是：
    一、抓活学活用。各地用“跟任务、抓时机、看发展”的方法推动活学活用毛主席著作。跟任务，就是当前有什么任务，就学习毛主席的有关著作。如开展抗旱斗争，就学习毛主席有关奋发图强，自力更生，敢于革命，彻底革命的著作。抓时机，就是从不同任务、不同工作环节、不同事件中，发现活思想，抓住时机，活学活用毛主席著作。当工作有了成绩，容易产生骄傲自满情绪的时候，便学习“一分为二”、
  “虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”等论述。当出现不团结苗头的时候，便学习《反对自由主义》。看发展，就是随着斗争任务的发展，掌握思想情况的变化，不断学习毛主席著作。
    二、从群众的实际情况出发，区别不同对象、不同季节、不同单位组织学习。如在农忙季节里多采用地头学、个人学、家庭学、会议学等形式学习，农闲季节则在党校、团校、民校学或在班组里学、俱乐部里学。
    三、狠抓典型，大树活学活用毛主席著作的样板。山东省委和各地区、各部门分别召开了学习毛主席著作经验交流会，树立了大批典型，促进了学习运动。
    四、做好学习毛主席著作的辅导工作。全省各地普遍建立了辅导队伍。全省还出版了大量辅导读物。
    山东各地还特别注意抓好基层党支部书记的学习。有些地委和县委还通过调基层干部轮流进党校、开会时学习、部署检查工作时学习等办法，帮助他们学习毛主席著作。
    山东省委认为，基层干部和工农群众学习毛主席著作的活动，发展很不平衡，真正学得好的还不多。特别是领导工作跟不上，落后于群众，落后于形势。今年各地除继续抓紧基层干部和工农群众学好《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇著作外，还要学习毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争的著作和语录，牢固地树立战备思想、阶级斗争的观点，开展兴无灭资的斗争，振作革命精神，走大寨之路，发展农业生产，建设社会主义新农村。
