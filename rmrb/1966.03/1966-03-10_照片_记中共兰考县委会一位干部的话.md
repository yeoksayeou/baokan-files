    ——Remembering a Cadre of the CPC Lankao County Committee

Yán Yùchāng, old Jiao went down to the countryside, and I often followed him. When the masses planted trees, he added soil; when the commune members controlled alkali land, he wielded a hoe; in the cow shed, he lit the lamp to add night grass; he ate from the same pot as the old poor peasants... I should have taken so many shots, but he always dodged aside! Old Jiao said: "If you want to take pictures, you should take pictures of the commune members, look how happily they're working!" The two or three photos that came out were taken while he wasn't paying attention, and I secretly pressed the shutter. "Why are there so few photos of Old Jiao? I really want to see him again..." Now, the villagers say this, and I can't stop the sadness in my heart. Seeing that I was upset, the villagers comforted me again: "Comrade, put your mind at ease: We remember him investigating the wind direction against the wind, we remember him braving the rain to explore the waterways, we remember the sound of him knocking on doors on snowy days, we remember him explaining 'The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains'! Comrade, we don't mind that you took so few photos, you could take more but you still couldn't capture it all. Although there are few photos of Old Jiao, all 360,000 people in Lankao have an image of him in their hearts! All 600 million of us in the country have Old Jiao imprinted in our hearts!"

    照片
    ——记中共兰考县委会一位干部的话阎豫昌老焦下乡去，我常跟在他身边。群众栽树他培土，社员治碱他挥锨，牛屋里他执灯添夜草，和老贫农同吃一锅饭……好多的镜头我应该照啊，他总是闪一边！老焦说：“要照应该照社员，你看哪，干的多么欢！”照出来的那两三张，是趁他没注意，我悄悄把快门按。“老焦的照片咋这样少？多想把他再看看……”如今哪，乡亲们这样讲，我止不住心头酸。见我难受乡亲们又劝：“同志啊，你心放宽：咱记得他顶风查风口，咱记得他冒雨把水路探，咱记得他雪天叩门声，咱记得他讲解《愚公移
  山》！同志啊，俺们不嫌你照的少，你照的再多也照不全。老焦的照片虽说少，咱三十六万兰考人，人人心里都有底板！咱全国六亿人啊，都把老焦印心间！”
