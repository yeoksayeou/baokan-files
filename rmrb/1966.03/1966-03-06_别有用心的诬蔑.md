    Malicious Slander with Ulterior Motives
    The Vientiane authorities of Laos have recently made a series of continuous slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying that the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is active in Laos and "violates the neutrality of Laos." As the saying goes, "Ivory doesn't grow from a dog's mouth." Such nonsense from the Vientiane authorities is not worth taking seriously. However, at a time when U.S. imperialism is actively planning to expand its war of aggression to the entire Indochina, it is noteworthy that the Vientiane authorities are issuing such frequent and ill-intentioned howls.
    Everyone knows that the Vientiane authorities are nothing more than a mouthpiece for Washington. The U.S. Secretary of Defense openly clamored on February 23 this year: "North Vietnam is a constant source of aggression against Laos." The Vientiane authorities are simply saying this tune in Lao. The purpose is obviously to cover up the U.S. expansion of its aggression against Laos.
    Recently, U.S. imperialism has not only intensified its indiscriminate bombing of the Lao liberated areas and directed the Lao right-wing army to launch frenzied attacks on the Lao patriotic forces, but also conspired to directly send troops to Laos to turn Laos into a second South Vietnam. Following Washington's instructions, the Vientiane authorities fabricated the ghost story of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's army entering Laos in order to create an excuse for U.S. imperialism to realize its criminal plan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on March 4, incisively exposing the despicable conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The people of Indochina have been dealing with U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for a long time and are very familiar with their tricks. They know that whenever Washington and its agents are vigorously clamoring that others are "aggressing," it means that they intend to take new aggressive actions, so they must be doubly vigilant and be prepared to give them a head-on blow.

### 别有用心的诬蔑

    别有用心的诬蔑
    老挝万象当局最近接连不断地对越南民主共和国进行一系列诬蔑，说什么越南民主共和国的军队在老挝活动，“侵犯老挝的中立”。俗话说，“狗嘴里长不出象牙”。对于万象当局的这种无稽之谈，本来是不值得认真对待的。但是，当美帝国主义正在积极策划把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的这个时候，万象当局如此频繁地发出这种别有用心的狂叫，却很可注意。
    谁都知道，万象当局不过是华盛顿的传声筒。美国国防部长在今年二月二十三日就公开叫嚷：“北越是对老挝进行的侵略的经常泉源”。万象当局只是把这种调调用老挝语说出来。其目的，显然是要为美国扩大对老挝的侵略打掩护。
    近来，美帝国主义不仅变本加厉地对老挝解放区进行狂轰滥炸，指使老挝右派军队对老挝爱国力量发动疯狂进攻，而且阴谋直接出兵老挝，把老挝变成为第二个南越。万象当局按照华盛顿的意旨，捏造所谓越南民主共和国军队进入老挝的鬼话，正是为了给美帝国主义实现它的这个罪恶计划制造借口。越南民主共和国外交部三月四日发表声明，一针见血地揭露了美帝国主义及其走狗的卑鄙阴谋。
    印度支那人民长期同美帝国主义及其走狗打交道，对于它们的伎俩，是熟悉得很的。他们知道，每当华盛顿和它的代理人使劲叫嚷别人“侵略”，那就意味着它们打算采取新的侵略行动，因而要对它们加倍警惕，并且作好准备，以便给以迎头痛击。
