    Arming Minds with Mao Zedong Thought, Organizing to Participate in Production Labor:
    Daqing Employees' Families Trained to Become Revolutionary Laborers
    They have tempered their thinking in the three great revolutionary movements, learned skills, and made great contributions to oilfield construction.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch) Daqing Oilfield employees' families, through the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and organized participation in collective production labor, have become a revolutionary labor force.  They have tempered their thinking in the three great revolutionary movements, learned labor production skills, fully exerted the role of "half the sky" in oilfield production and construction, and set a shining example for the revolutionary transformation of employees' families nationwide.

    Currently, over 95% of Daqing Oilfield employees' families with the ability to work, including the families of leaders at all levels, have participated in collective production labor. Among them, two-thirds are engaged in collective agricultural and sideline production and service industries; one-third are workers and farmers, working in the mining area during the slack farming season or when the oilfield needs them, carrying out tasks such as repairing roads, sewing labor protection supplies, and engaging in agricultural labor during the busy farming season.

    Following Our Own Path, Cultivating a Revolutionary Family Force
    In the past, some places building industrial and mining areas blindly copied foreign models, building large-scale towns as living bases, which transformed a large number of employees' families from rural areas from producers to consumers. This not only increased the burden on the state and enterprises but also, due to separation from collective labor, made them susceptible to bourgeois ideology, which was detrimental to the revolutionization of families and employees, and detrimental to the proletarian revolutionary cause. At the beginning of Daqing Oilfield's construction, the oilfield Party committee determined that it must break with foreign conventions and follow its own path according to Mao Zedong Thought.  It had to fully exert the role of this new socialist position politically, ideologically, and economically, not only to increase new products for socialist construction, but also to cultivate a revolutionary employee force and a revolutionary family force.  They conducted a lot of education among the families, mobilizing and organizing them to participate in collective production labor. The oilfield Party committee believed that only by arming the minds of employees' families with Mao Zedong Thought, only by organizing them to participate in labor and taking the path of collectivization, could families more quickly accept proletarian ideology. Only in that way could families, living dispersed in various small households, be cultivated into a politically conscious, organized, disciplined, and skilled proletarian revolutionary labor force.  This is precisely what happened.  Daqing Oilfield organized employees' families to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, conducted repeated class education, labor education, mining area construction policy education, and education on the situation and tasks, organizing them to participate in production labor, participate in class struggle, and guiding them to take the path of collectivization, which rapidly brought about profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the vast number of employees' families.  Many of the various erroneous thoughts they had in the past, such as belittling labor, relying on their husbands, and feeling inferior, were corrected, and they generally recognized that "labor is glorious, not laboring is shameful," and that "women should also contribute to socialist construction and serve the revolution."  Their class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and their collectivist spirit was greatly promoted. Many people said: "In the past, we ate our fill and had nothing to do, carried our children around, and had petty calculations in our minds; now, our minds are clear, our eyes are bright, we are full of strength, and we are dedicated to building the great oilfield."

    Employees' families, organized to participate in collective production labor, have created a large amount of material wealth for the country and supported oilfield construction. In 1965 alone, families throughout the mining area produced more than 40 million jin of grain, more than 30 million jin of vegetables, and 250,000 jin of poultry, eggs, and meat products. In recent years, because families in the mining area have produced a large amount of grain and various non-staple foods themselves, the state's supply burden for Daqing Oilfield has been greatly reduced.  Families also worked together with employees in the mining area to build the mining area during slack farming seasons and after work, and have built more than one million square meters of "dry-built" housing in recent years.  Various workshops, canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, barber shops, and other service departments run by families are spread throughout the mining area's industrial and agricultural villages.

    Loving Labor, Thinking of the Collective, Doing Revolution
    Daqing Oilfield's practice proves that for employees' families to be revolutionized, they must first take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, and realize laborization and collectivization. In class struggle and collective production labor, people transform nature and society, and at the same time transform themselves. The backward can become advanced, and the advanced can become even more advanced.

    The vast majority of families in the mining area are from working people's backgrounds, have a certain degree of awareness, and have a desire to contribute to socialist construction. Some of them suffered oppression and exploitation in the old society. Once mobilized, organized, and given revolutionary education, their class consciousness is further enhanced, and they become the backbone of the family force. These people love labor, care about the collective, take the lead in everything, and help backward families improve their ideological understanding at any time. Xue Guifang, the production team leader who suffered hardship and bitterness in the old society, is already over fifty years old, but she still helps team members and relevant employees solve ideological problems at any time, making the production team she leads a banner among the families. She herself has always maintained the glorious title of a five-good family member and has become a role model for families to learn from. She said: "As long as I live, I will labor every day, and as long as I have a breath, I will contribute to socialism." Some families also came from working people's backgrounds, but were used to living by relying on their husbands, and had the dependent thought of "marrying a man to eat and dress." Through labor, these people have also changed, and many have become labor activists. They said: "In the past, we looked at a house and thought of our husbands and children." "Now, we love labor, think of the collective, and do revolution. We will not be lazy women!"

    Some families who came from exploiting class families or were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology came to the oilfield wanting to live a comfortable and easy life, belittled labor, and were afraid of hardship, but now they are also determined to take the path of laborization and revolutionization. One employee's family, who came from a landlord family, did not like anything when she first came to Daqing from Shanghai and planned to go back after her husband got his salary, squatting at home all day. When people mobilized her to work, she said, "I am afraid of the cold, afraid of the wind, and afraid of getting my face tanned." Later, after the leaders and everyone patiently helped her and advised her to read Chairman Mao's works, she was finally changed. Now she not only works well but has also become a good propagandist for the production team. Another family was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, loved ease and hated work. In 1955, she followed her husband to the Yumen Oil Mine, and all she thought about was eating, drinking, playing, and having fun. After coming to Daqing, although she joined the production team, she always worked on and off at the beginning, rarely attending. With the help of the leaders and everyone, she is now not afraid of hardship or fatigue in labor, rushes to do heavy work, and has been elected as the squad leader by everyone.

    Some families are also willing to participate in labor, but have a sense of inferiority, thinking that "families are just for taking care of housework and looking after children. What good is it to organize them?!" Now they dare to think and dare to act. One year, fifteen young family members planted a piece of land. At first, they did not know how to plow the land with oxen. On the first day in the field, when they told the ox to walk, the ox insisted on standing; when they told the ox to stand, the ox insisted on walking. Some people got big blood blisters on their hands and cried. However, after studying Chairman Mao's works, they mustered up their courage and worked hard for six days, and finally learned the skill of one person holding a plow and plowing several acres of land a day. They summed up their experience and said: "Women comrades should not underestimate themselves. As long as they have the revolutionary determination, they can learn and do well what women have never done before."

    Establishing New Families and New Customs on the Basis of Revolutionization and Laborization
    Daqing Oilfield has seen the emergence of many new types of families. In these families, bourgeois ideology has been repelled, and proletarian ideology has occupied the position. Before employees' families participated in labor, some families often had negative factors due to backward thinking. Employees said: "A east wind blows when I go to work, and a west wind blows when I get off work." "You talk about petroleum machinery, she talks about woolen fabric." They always couldn't talk to each other. These families participated in labor, their thinking changed, and new scenes appeared in the family. Now employees say of their families: "They talk about labor, they talk about revolution, and we have a common language." There are also some families where employees, with the old society's views of belittling women, regarded their families as their appendages and even beat and scolded their wives, causing family discord. When families were mobilized to participate in collective production, they disagreed even more. Now these people have changed their wrong thinking, and their families have also taken on a new look. When Yin Shuqin first participated in collective labor, her husband tried every means to stop her. Once, when Yin Shuqin went to a meeting, her husband grabbed a carrying pole and blocked the door, not letting her go, and said: "You can participate in the production team, but first, you must take good care of the children, second, you must take care of the housework, and third, you must cook meals for me on time. If you miss one, it won't work!" After the education of the Party branch and Yin Shuqin's struggle, her husband's awareness improved, and he took the initiative to propose learning from his wife. From then on, the couple made a plan to strive to become a "double red household." At the year-end general evaluation, sure enough, one became a five-good family member and the other became a five-good employee.

    After families participated in labor, they achieved economic independence and political equality. Husband and wives in many families no longer squabble over small things. Many families study Chairman Mao's works with their husbands after work, talk about work, talk about ideals, encourage each other, and improve together. This family relationship, built on the basis of laborization and revolutionization, has also had a profound impact on the healthy growth of the next generation. Many children, like their parents, love labor and love the country and the collective.

    Because of adhering to the path of revolutionization and laborization, a new style of mutual respect, unity, and mutual assistance has also emerged among employees' families. If someone in the family is unhappy, everyone goes to analyze and solve the problem; if a family has difficulties, everyone rushes to help. This new social atmosphere, where one person has trouble and everyone helps, fills every corner of the Daqing mining area with a new atmosphere.

    Among the employees' families in Daqing Oilfield, more than 4,300 people have become five-good family members in recent years, more than 130 people have become members of the Communist Youth League, and more than 160 people have honorably become members of the Communist Party of China. This revolutionary family force, together with the revolutionary employee force, has made great contributions to China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    用毛泽东思想武装头脑　组织起来参加生产劳动
    大庆职工家属锻炼成革命化的劳动者
    她们在三大革命运动中炼红了思想，学会了本领，为油田建设作出巨大贡献
    据新华社二日讯　大庆油田职工家属活学活用毛泽东思想，组织起来参加集体生产劳动，已经成为一支革命化的劳动大军。她们在三大革命斗争中炼红了思想，学会了劳动生产的本领，在油田生产和建设中充分发挥了“半边天”的作用，为全国职工家属革命化树立了光辉榜样。
    现在，大庆油田有劳动能力的职工家属，包括各级领导干部的家属在内，百分之九十五以上已经参加了集体生产劳动。她们之中，有三分之二从事集体农副业生产和服务性行业的劳动；三分之一是亦工亦农的劳动者，在农闲或油田需要时，为矿区进行维修公路、缝补劳保用品等工作，农忙季节就从事农业劳动。
    走自己的路子，带出一支革命化家属队伍
    过去有些地方建设工矿区，由于照洋框框翻版，建设了规模较大的城镇作为生活基地，使大批从农村来的职工家属，由生产者变为消费者。这样不仅增加国家和企业的负担，而且由于脱离集体劳动，容易受资产阶级思想侵蚀，不利于家属和职工的革命化，不利于无产阶级的革命事业。大庆油田建设之初，油田党委就认定必须打破洋框框，按照毛泽东思想走自己的路子，要在政治、思想、经济上全面地发挥这个社会主义新阵地的作用，不光是为社会主义建设增加新产品，还必须带出一支革命化的职工队伍，带出一支革命化的家属队伍。他们对家属们进行了很多教育，动员和组织家属参加集体生产劳动。油田党委认为，只有用毛泽东思想武装职工家属的头脑，只有组织她们参加劳动并走集体化的道路，才能使家属更快地接受无产阶级的思想，才能把分散在各个小家庭生活的家属培养成为一支有政治觉悟、有组织、有纪律、有生产技能的无产阶级革命化的劳动大军。事实正是这样。大庆油田把职工家属组织起来大学毛主席著作，针对她们的思想反复地进行阶级教育、劳动教育、矿区建设方针的教育和形势任务的教育，组织她们参加生产劳动，参加阶级斗争，引导她们走集体化的道路，就使广大职工家属的精神面貌迅速发生了深刻变化。她们之中的许多人过去存在的轻视劳动、依赖丈夫、自卑等种种错误思想，得到了纠正，而且普遍认识到了：“劳动光荣，不劳动可耻”、“妇女也应当为社会主义建设出力，为革命效劳”。她们的阶级觉悟大大提高，集体主义精神大大发扬。许多人说：“过去是，吃饱饭，没事干，抱上孩子到处转，心里装个小算盘；现在是，心里明，眼睛亮，浑身上下是力量，一心建设大油田”。
    职工家属组织起来参加集体生产劳动，为国家创造了大量物质财富，支援了油田建设。单是一九六五年一年，全矿区家属就生产了四千多万斤粮食，三千多万斤蔬菜，二十五万斤禽蛋肉食品。几年来，由于矿区家属自己动手生产了大量粮食和各种副食品，大大减轻了国家对大庆油田的供应负担。家属们还同矿区职工一起利用农闲和工余时间建设矿区，几年来先后建设了一百多万平方米的“干打垒”住宅。由家属们举办的各种作坊、食堂、托儿所、缝衣组、理发店等服务部门，遍及矿区各个工农村。
    爱的是劳动，想的是集体，干的是革命
    大庆油田的实践证明，职工家属要革命化，首先必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，实现劳动化，集体化。在阶级斗争中、集体生产劳动中，人们改造自然，改造社会，同时也改造自己，后进的可以变为先进，先进的更加先进。
    矿区的家属绝大部分是劳动人民出身，有一定的觉悟，有为社会主义建设出力的愿望。她们之中的一部分人在旧社会由于受压迫受剥削，一经动员组织和受到革命化的教育，阶级觉悟就更加提高，成为家属队伍中的骨干。这些人热爱劳动，关心集体，处处起带头作用，随时帮助后进家属提高思想认识。在旧社会饱受苦难辛酸的生产队指导员薛桂芳，已经五十多岁了，还随时帮助队员和有关职工解决思想问题，使她所领导的生产队成为家属当中的一面旗帜。她自己也始终保持着五好家属的光荣称号，成为家属学习的榜样。她说：“我只要活一天，就要劳动一天，只要还有一口气，就要为社会主义出一把力。”有些家属原来也是劳动人民出身，但过惯了依靠丈夫的生活，有“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想。通过劳动，这些人也变了，许多人成了劳动积极分子。她们说：“过去，眼里看的是一间房子，心里想的丈夫孩子。”“现在，爱的是劳动，想的是集体，干的是革命。我们不当懒婆娘！”
    有些出身于剥削阶级家庭或受资产阶级思想影响较深的家属，到油田来的时候一心想过舒服安逸的生活，轻视劳动，害怕艰苦，现在也坚决走劳动化、革命化的路。有一个出身地主家庭的职工家属，刚从上海到大庆的时候，看见什么都不合心意，打算等爱人发了工资就回去，成天蹲在家里。人家动员她劳动，她说：“怕冷、怕风、怕晒黑了脸。”后来经过领导和大家耐心帮助，又劝导她读毛主席的著作，终于把她改变过来了。现在她不仅劳动好，还成了生产队的好宣传员。还有一个家属受资产阶级思想影响较深，好逸恶劳，一九五五年她随爱人到了玉门油矿，成天讲究吃、喝、玩、乐，到大庆以后，虽然参加了生产队，但是开始时总是三天打鱼，两天晒网，很少出勤。经过领导和大家的帮助，现在她在劳动中不怕苦、不怕累，抢重活干，被大伙选为班长。
    有些家属也愿意参加劳动，但是有自卑感，认为“家属嘛，管管家务，看看孩子就行了，组织起来能顶啥用？！”现在她们也敢想敢干了。有一年，十五名青年家属种了块地。开始她们不会使牛犁田，头一天下地，叫牛走，牛偏站；叫牛站，牛偏走，有的人手拉起了大血泡，就哭了起来。但是，她们经过学习毛主席的著作，鼓起了勇气，勤学苦练了六天，终于练出了一人扶一张犁，一天耕几亩地的本领。她们总结经验说：“女同志不要小看自己，只要有革命的决心，过去妇女没有干过的事，照样能学会，能干好。”
    在革命化劳动化基础上建立新家庭新风尚
    大庆油田，出现了许许多多新型的家庭。在这些家庭里面，资产阶级思想受到排挤，无产阶级思想占领了阵地。职工家属没有参加劳动以前，有些家属由于思想落后，家庭里面常常出现消极因素，职工说：“上班刮东风，下班刮西风。”“你讲石油机器，她讲毛料哔叽。”总是说不到一起去。这些家属参加了劳动，思想变了，家庭也出现了新气象。现在职工提起他们的家庭来都说：“说的都是劳动，讲的都是革命，可有共同语言了。”也有一些家庭，由于职工带着旧社会轻视妇女的观点，把家属看成是自己的附属品，甚至打骂老婆，造成家庭不和，动员家属参加集体生产，他们更不同意。现在这些人都改变了错误思想，家庭也换了新面貌。家属尹淑琴开始参加集体劳动时，爱人百般阻挠她，有一次尹淑琴去开会，她丈夫抓起扁担拦住门不让去，还说：“你参加生产队可以，但是第一要看好孩子，第二要管好家务，第三要按时给我做好饭，少一条都不行！”经过党支部的教育和尹淑琴的斗争，丈夫觉悟提高了，主动提出向爱人学习。从此，夫妻两人订了争当“双红户”的计划，到年终总评时，果然一个成了五好家属，一个成了五好职工。
    家属参加劳动以后，取得了经济上的独立，政治上的平等，许许多多家庭的夫妻之间再也不为一些小事扯皮了。许多家属工余同丈夫一起学习毛主席著作，谈工作，谈理想，互相鼓励，共同提高。这种建立在劳动化革命化基础上的家庭关系，对下一代的健康成长也发生了深刻影响。不少儿童就象他们的父母一样，热爱劳动，热爱国家和集体。
    由于坚持走革命化、劳动化的道路，在职工家属中间，也出现了互相尊重、团结互助的崭新的风尚。家属中有人有了不开心的事，大家都去分析解决；谁家有了困难，大家也赶来帮忙。一人有事、大家相助的这种社会新风气，使得大庆矿区的各个角落都充满了新的气息。
    大庆油田职工家属中，几年来已经有四千三百多人成了五好家属，一百三十多人成为共青团团员，一百六十多人光荣地成为中国共产党党员。这支革命化的家属队伍同革命化的职工队伍一起，在我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出了巨大贡献。
