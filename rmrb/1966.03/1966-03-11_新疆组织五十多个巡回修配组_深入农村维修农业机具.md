    According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 10th: Agricultural machinery repair departments in various parts of Xinjiang have recently organized more than fifty mobile repair teams to go deep into rural areas to carry out various repair activities, so that these agricultural machinery can fully play their role in spring plowing. In the past four months, they have repaired more than 1,000 combine-tractors and more than 80,000 pieces of other mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural implements.

    In order to ensure that all tractors and agricultural implements that need repair can be repaired, this year, while utilizing repair network points for on-site repair, agricultural machinery repair departments in various places have also transferred experienced technicians and cadres to organize mobile repair teams to go to the forefront of agricultural production to repair agricultural tools for communes and production teams, and to impart operation and repair techniques, and to train technical personnel for production teams. At present, in Hotan, Hami and other areas where spring cultivation starts earlier, some tractors have already been driven to the fields and are about to begin spring plowing.

    新疆组织五十多个巡回修配组
    深入农村维修农业机具
    据新华社乌鲁木齐十日电新疆各地农业机具修配部门，最近组织了五十多个巡回修配组，深入农村进行各种维修活动，以便这些农业机具能够在春耕中充分发挥作用。四个月来，他们已修理拖拉机一千多混合台，其他机械化和半机械化农具八万多架（件）。
    为了保证所有需要修配的拖拉机和农机具都能修好，今年，各地农机具修配部门，在利用修配网点就地修配的同时，还抽调了有经验的技术工人和干部，组织巡回修配组，分赴农业生产第一线，为公社、生产队修农具并传授操作和修配技术，为生产队培养技术人材。目前，开春较早的和田、哈密等专区，部分拖拉机已经开到田边地头，即将开犁春耕。
