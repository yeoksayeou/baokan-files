    Bullets That Are Truly Tough Have Eyes
    Zhou Hongxing
    I really like the line in the soldiers' song: "Bullets that are truly tough have eyes." How can bullets be "truly tough"? Originally, I thought they were only "trained" to be that way. Why does it also say they "have eyes"? I thought that must be a "figure of speech" to describe the soldiers' superb marksmanship. After reading many reports about emphasizing politics, I have a new understanding of these issues.
    The same bullets, guns, and cannons have different effects when held by armies and soldiers of different natures. What about when the same bullets, guns, and cannons are held by revolutionary armies and revolutionary soldiers? Facts have proven that when they proceed from a "purely technical" point of view and "train hard" for superb skills, not only does their technique improve slowly, but they often encounter this or that problem. When they arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and solve the question of "for whom" and "why" they are training and fighting, they can train with the idea of the enemy situation in mind, concentrate their hatred on the muzzle of the gun, overcome all kinds of hardships and difficulties, and quickly master superb techniques and skills. Therefore, the soldiers say: "Only when the gun in our minds is tough, can the gun in our hands be tough," "Only when our minds are red, will the sights be correct." They use their personal practice to prove the brilliance and correctness of the assertion that "progressive political spirit must be infused into the army" and that "all techniques and tactics" can "exert their due effect" ("On Protracted War").
    This made me understand that "bullets that are truly tough" do indeed "have eyes." This "having eyes" is because revolutionary soldiers "have eyes." However, this is neither the physical eyes of ordinary people, nor the "fiery golden eyes" mentioned in myths, but "spiritual eyes," "political eyes." This "eye" has the broadest vision, "standing on the cliff, embracing the globe," "living in a thatched hut, looking out at the world." This "eye" has the clearest love and hate, and observes things most thoroughly. It is an inexhaustible source of strength and wisdom.
    This also made me think that not only do soldiers' "bullets that are truly tough have eyes," but also on the drill bits of Wang Jinxi, the Daqing man who built his career on the "Two Theories," on the hoes of Chen Yonggui, the Dazhai man who succeeded through "self-reliance and hard struggle," on the cards of Rong Xianjie, the model grain store cashier praised by the masses as a "living household register" and "iron abacus"... In short, on all truly tough tools and technologies, this "spiritual eye" and "political eye" grows.
    With this "spiritual eye" and "political eye," bullets, drill bits, and hoes can "have eyes," and people can master superb skills. For example, a grain store cashier in Jilin City, wholeheartedly wanted to learn Rong Xianjie's superb skills of "instant calculation" (being able to instantly state the price of any amount of rice, white flour, sorghum flour, corn flour from one jin to forty jin, and soybean oil from one liang to four jin, without using an abacus) and "knowing five things" (knowing the names, addresses, occupations, population, and grain consumption of the grain-using households), but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't learn it. What was the reason? Tracing it to the root, it was because her "ideology was not tough enough." Finally, she started by studying Chairman Mao's works, solved a series of ideological problems, and then truly developed the superb skills of "instant calculation" and "knowing five things." If we want to make the business and technology we engage in truly tough, and be able to grow "spiritual eyes" and "political eyes," we must study Mao Zedong Thought diligently.

    过得硬的子弹长着眼
    舟红行
    我很喜欢战士的歌曲中这样一句歌词：“过得硬的子弹长着眼。”子弹怎样才能“过得硬”呢？原来，我只以为是“练”出来的。为什么又说它“长着眼”呢？我又以为那一定是“形容词”，形容战士们高超的射击本领。读了许多有关突出政治的报道之后，我才对这些问题有了新的看法。
    同样的子弹、枪炮掌握在不同性质的军队和士兵手中，其作用显然是不同的。同样的子弹、枪炮掌握在革命军队和革命战士的手中，情形又怎样呢？事实证明，当他们从“纯技术”观点出发，“苦练”过硬功时，不光技术迟迟上不去，而且常常会出现这样或那样的问题；当他们以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，解决了“为谁”、“为什么”而练兵打仗时，他们就能够带着敌情观念去练，就能够把仇恨集中在枪口上，战胜各种艰苦困难，迅速掌握过硬的技术和本领。所以战士们说：“只有思想中的枪过硬，手中的枪才能过硬”，“只有思想红，才会准星正”。他们用亲身的实践证明了只有把“进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中”、“一切技术和战术”才能“发挥它们应有的效力”（《论持久战》）这一论断的英明、正确。
    由此使我明白了，“过得硬的子弹”的确是“长着眼”的。这“长着眼”，是由于革命战士“长着眼”。不过，这既不是普通人的肉眼，也不是神话中所说的“火眼金睛”，而是“精神眼睛”、“政治眼睛”。这个
  “眼睛”，视野最广阔，“站在崖顶，胸怀全球”，“身居茅屋，放眼世界”；这个“眼睛”，爱憎最分明，观察事物最透彻。它是力量和智慧的无尽的源泉。
    由此也使我联想起，不仅战士
  “过得硬的子弹长着眼”，在靠“两论”起家的大庆人王进喜的钻头上，在以“自力更生、奋发图强”取胜的大寨人陈永贵的锄头上，在被群众誉为“活户口”、“铁算盘”的粮店模范收款员荣先杰的卡片上，……总之，在一切真正过得硬的工具和技术上，都长着这个“精神眼睛”、“政治眼睛”。
    有了这个“精神眼睛”、“政治眼睛”，子弹、钻头、锄头才能“长着眼”，人们才能掌握过硬的本领。例如，吉林市一位粮店收款员，一心要学会荣先杰“一口清”（从一斤到四十斤的大米、白面、高粱米、玉米面和一两至四斤的豆油，随便你买多少，可以不用算盘，随口报出你要买的粮米或油应付的钱）“五知道”（把用粮户的姓名、住址、职业、人口和用粮情况全都了解）的过硬本领，学来学去还是学不会。什么原因呢？追到了根底，是因为“思想不过硬”。最后，她从学习毛主席著作入手，解决了一系列思想问题，然后才真正地练出“一口清”、“五知道”的过硬本领。要想使自己从事的业务和技术，真正过硬，能够长起“精神眼睛”、“政治眼睛”，就非刻苦学习毛泽东思想不可。
