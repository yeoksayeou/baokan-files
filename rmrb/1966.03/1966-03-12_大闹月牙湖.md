　　After the New Spring Festival, the weather suddenly turned cold. A northwest wind blew in a sky full of goose feather snowflakes, and the yellow earth was immediately covered with a layer of snow felt. The doors of each house were closed, and just at this moment, the black lacquered gate of a house in the east of the village creaked open, and a man in his forties walked out. The snow beat his face, and the wind blew against him, but he didn't seem to care at all, hurrying forward.

　　This man's name is Zhang Daxian, and he is the Party Branch Secretary of the Crescent Lake Brigade. It is said that the brigade's agricultural production was very successful last year, and bumper harvests were achieved in both the summer and autumn seasons; this year, the wheat roots are growing well again, and the commune members are all delighted, so what is he worried about? It turns out that this is the case. The three natural villages and ten production teams of this brigade are all located on the Yellow Ridge, with more than 300 mu of ridge slopes. Some plots are high in the middle and low at both ends, while others are low in the middle and high at both ends. The high ones can't retain water, and the low ones can't drain water, and every year only one crop of early autumn crops is planted, and the harvest is not reliable. In the past, the brigade always lacked confidence in transforming this part of low-yielding land. Recently, Zhang Daxian visited Dazhai and was inspired by the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the Dazhai people. He thought: If the people of Dazhai can turn poor mountain gullies full of stones into fertile fields, can't we make good crops grow on ridge slopes? Having determination also requires methods! He was racking his brains for this problem, preparing to brave the wind and snow to consult with the old advisor, Zhang Yucuan.

　　Zhang Yucuan is already over sixty years old and is an agricultural enthusiast. He is a top expert in the field of farming and is proficient in all kinds of agricultural work. At this moment, he was asking his grandson, Jinqiu, to read "Serve the People" to him when he suddenly saw Daxian push the door open and enter. After Yucuan and Daxian chatted for a while, Daxian changed the subject and asked, "Uncle, that piece of land at Zhang Lao's grave used to be your family's ancestral land and was also on the eastern ridge. How did you manage to make it so flat and cultivate such a strong soil base?" The old man sighed and said, "That piece of land was watered with sweat! In the past, my family only had that ancestral burial ground, which was uneven and the yellow soil clods were as hard as flint, only growing wild wormwood, not crop seedlings. Later, I shoveled away the soil from the high places, filled in the low places, and turned up the raw yellow soil below, which made the soil quality even worse. What to do? The silt of Crescent Lake is a good treasure for nourishing the land, but at that time, the lake was managed by the landlord Zhang Laotian, who dared to move earth on the head of the local tyrant? I could only take the time to pick up wild manure, one basket of manure a day, and the manure spread on the ground was at least two inches thick, only then did I fertilize this piece of land. Because I owed Zhang Laotian the debt of the King of Hell, he eventually seized it." Daxian listened intently, slapped his knees with both hands, and exclaimed happily, "Crescent Lake used to be managed by Zhang Laotian, but now it's managed by our People's Commune!" Only then did Yucuan realize Daxian's intention and said with a smile:
  "You want to transform that 300 mu of ridge slope land?" Daxian nodded with a smile. Yucuan hesitated for a while, smacked his lips and said, "The method is good, but the project is too big!" Daxian said confidently, "With more people, we can move mountains. What are we afraid of if the project is big!"

　　After lunch, the heavy snow was still falling. The charcoal fire in the brigade office was burning brightly, and all the production team leaders of the brigade came to the meeting. Everyone knew that holding a meeting in the heavy snow must be to arrange some urgent tasks. Before the meeting, Daxian first took out a small booklet from his pocket and said to everyone, "Let's first study the article 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains'." This is also a habit of this brigade. Every time they have a meeting, they must first study Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with the work tasks. After reading the article, the female team leader of the third team, Zhang Yurong, hurriedly said, "Old Zhang, we have accepted the task. Just tell us how to do it!" Daxian chuckled and said, "You are really a prophet, what task?" Yurong made a face and said with a smile, "You introduced the situation of visiting Dazhai to everyone the day before yesterday, and today you are studying 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains'. After analyzing the two together, I know what the task is: First, flatten the land, and second, add lake mud, right?" Daxian laughed heartily when he heard this, and everyone else applauded enthusiastically. After a short discussion, the meeting ended. Everyone was very motivated and determined to make a big fuss at Crescent Lake and transform the low-yielding land.

　　That afternoon, the wind and snow lessened. Zhang Daxian led more than twenty male commune members, carrying shovels and brooms, clearing snow and clearing roads, preparing to start full-scale work as soon as the snow stopped. At this time, a middle-aged woman came from Huanggangtou, with a blue belt tied around her waist, wearing a bamboo hat, and carrying a round-mouthed iron shovel on her shoulder. She walked up to Daxian and roared angrily, "You are really strange. When you go out to do public work, you don't even call me." Daxian said, "I'm afraid you women comrades can't bear this hardship." She said, "How can you underestimate people? If you dare to go up the mountain to catch tigers, I dare to go down the sea to capture dragons." Someone joked from the side, "Wow! Sister-in-law Zhang is really capable!" Sister-in-law Zhang then said, "Family members of cadres must take the lead in participating in collective labor!" Daxian nodded and said with a smile, "Okay, right, this time you're right." Everyone laughed heartily.

　　After a while, another group of women walked over, talking and laughing, led by Zhang Yurong. When Zhang Daxian saw them, he shouted, "It's cold and snowy! Why are you here too!" The women seemed to have discussed it in advance, and they answered in one voice, "The cold weather can't beat the heat in our hearts, and the heavy snow can't beat our great enthusiasm."

　　The next day, the wind and snow stopped, and the commune members gathered from all directions. The Crescent Lake was full of people. Poles and carts shuttled back and forth, and laughter was everywhere. Daxian pushed a cart and sang happily. One person sings and everyone else harmonizes, and the melodious singing spreads everywhere:

　　Work hard, work practically, and work skillfully,
　　Work hard to transform low-yielding land,
　　Shed a few more drops of sweat in the spring,
　　In the autumn, grain and cotton will pile up like mountains. (Attached picture)
　　Dazhai spirit blossoms new flowers. Wang Xin

    大闹月牙湖
    安徽阜南县文化馆　吴兆洛
    交罢新春，天气忽然转冷了。一场西北风，吹来了漫天的鹅毛雪片，黄橙橙的大地立刻铺上了一层雪毡。各家的大门都关上了，就在这当儿，村东头的一家黑漆大门吱呀一声开了，走出来一位四十来岁的汉子。雪打脸，风吹面，他好象一点也不在意，急急忙忙地向前走着。
    这人名叫张大献，是月牙湖大队的党支部书记。按说，去年全大队的农业生产搞得很出色，夏秋两季都取得了丰收；今年呢，麦根长得又好，社员们都欢天喜地的，他还忧心个啥哩？原来是这么回事。这个大队的三个自然庄、十个生产队，都座落在黄岗头上，有三百多亩岗坡地，有的地块是中间高两头洼，有的地块是中间洼两头高。高的保不住水，洼的排不出涝，每年种一茬早秋作物，收成还不牢靠。过去对这部分低产田，大队一直缺乏信心改造它。最近张大献到大寨去参观了一次，被大寨人自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神所鼓舞。他想：大寨人能把尽是石头的穷山沟改成良田，我们就不能让岗坡地长出好庄稼吗？有决心还要有办法呀！他正是为了这个问题在动脑筋，准备冒着风雪，去找老顾问张玉川商量哩。
    张玉川已经六十多岁了，是个爱社迷，他在庄稼行里是头等把式，精通各项农活。此刻，他正叫孙孙金球给他读《为人民服务》，忽然看见大献推门进来。玉川老汉和大献谈了一阵家常之后，大献一转话题问道：“大伯，张老坟那块地，过去是你家的地根，也是在东岗坎上，怎么侍弄得那么平整，地劲培的那么大呀？”老汉叹了口气说：“那块地是用汗水浇出来的呀！俺家过去只有那一块祖传的老坟地，高洼不平，黄土块子跟火石一般硬，只长野黄蒿，不长庄稼苗。后来，我把高处的土铲掉，把洼处填平，又把下面的生黄土翻上来，这样土质就更孬了。怎么办呢？月牙湖的淤泥肥，是养地的好宝贝，可那阵湖归地主张老天管，谁敢在太岁头上动土？我只得抽空拾野粪，一天一筐粪，地皮上铺的粪足有二寸厚，才把这块地喂肥。因为欠下张老天的阎王债，到底给他霸占去了。”大献听入了神，他两手啪地拍了下膝盖，高兴地叫道：“月牙湖那阵归张老天管，现在可归咱人民公社管了呀！”玉川老汉这时才悟出大献的来意，笑道：
  “你是想改造那三百亩岗坡地呀？”大献含笑点了点头。玉川老汉迟疑了一会，咂了咂嘴说：“办法虽好，可工程太大呀！”大献充满信心地说：“人多能搬山，工程大怕什么！”
    吃罢晌午饭，大雪仍纷纷扬扬地下着，大队办公室里的炭火烧得正旺，全大队的生产队长都来开会了。大家心里都明白，大雪天开会，一定要布置什么紧急任务。开会之前，大献先从怀里掏出一本小册子，向大家说道：“先学学《愚公移山》这篇文章吧。”这也是这个大队的习惯，每次开会，都要结合工作任务，先学习毛主席著作。文章念完，三队的女队长张玉蓉就急忙说：“老张，任务我们接受了，你就说说怎么干吧？”大献嘿嘿地笑道：“你真是未来先知，啥任务呀？”玉蓉做了个鬼脸，笑道：“你前天向大家介绍参观大寨的情况，今天又学习《愚公移山》，两下结合起来一分析，我就知道啥任务了：第一平整土地，第二加施湖泥，对吗？”张大献一听哈哈大笑起来，其他的人都热烈鼓掌。会议经过简短的讨论，便结束了，大家劲头都很足，决心大闹月牙湖，改造低产田。
    当天下午，风雪小了。张大献带领二十多个男社员，拿着铁锨、笤帚，在铲雪清路，准备雪停就全面开工。这时，从黄岗头来了一个中年妇女，腰间扎着一条蓝带子，头上戴顶斗笠，肩膀上扛一把圆口铁锨，走到大献跟前，气呼呼地吼道：“你这人真怪，出门干公活，也不喊我一声。”大献说：“我怕你们女同志吃不了这份苦。”她道：“你怎么小看人。你敢上山掏老虎，我就敢下海擒蛟龙。”有人在一旁打趣道：“嗬！张嫂子真行！”张嫂子紧接着说：“干部家属要带头参加集体劳动嘛！”大献点着头笑道：“好，对，这回算你有理。”逗得大家哈哈笑起来。
    过了一会，又有一群妇女说说笑笑的走过来，领头的是张玉蓉。张大献一看，喊道：“雪天冷呀！你们怎么也来了！”妇女们好象是预先商量好的，一条嗓的大声回答道：“天冷顶不住心头热，雪大顶不住干劲大。”
    第二天风雪停了，社员们从四面八方集拢来了。月牙湖上，黑压压的全是人。挑子、小车来往穿梭，到处笑语声喧。大献推着小车，乐哈哈地唱起歌来。一人唱歌众人和，琅琅歌声四处传：
    苦干实干加巧干，
    下劲改造低产田，
    春天多流几滴汗，
    秋后粮棉堆成山。（附图片）
