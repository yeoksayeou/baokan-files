Agriculture has achieved an all-round bumper harvest, the total industrial output value has increased significantly, and other tasks have also achieved great achievements.
    When reviewing the path the Autonomous Region has experienced in the eight years since its establishment, Qin Yingji said that our various undertakings must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, emphasize politics, and take class struggle and the struggle between two roads as the key. He said that practice has proved that whenever we follow Mao Zedong Thought closely and well, our achievements will be great.

He said that the US aggressors have become increasingly deeply mired in the vast ocean of people's war in Vietnam. Although its war blackmail policy and "peace talks" conspiracy have been repeatedly thwarted, it has not given up. Qin Yingji said that we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against US imperialism, do a good job in all preparations, and be ready at any time to oppose US imperialism imposing war on the people of our country. He also expressed his firm support for the Vietnamese people in carrying out the just struggle against US aggression and for national salvation to the end. He said that no matter what storms arise, we, together with the people of the whole country, will resolutely support the fraternal Vietnamese people until we completely defeat the aggression of US imperialism.

    覃应机在回顾自治区成立八年来所经历的道路时说，我们的各项事业，必须以毛泽东思想为指针，突出政治，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲。他说，实践证明，什么时候我们跟毛泽东思想跟得紧，跟得好，我们的成绩就大。他号召自治区的全体干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作，不断总结经验，使我们不断有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    覃应机说，今年是第三个五年计划的第一年，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，促进人的思想革命化，继续贯彻自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向新的高潮，全面完成和超额完成自治区的国民经济计划。
    覃应机在谈到目前的世界形势时，热烈祝贺英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。他说，美国侵略者在越南已经越来越深地陷入人民战争的汪洋大海。虽然它的战争讹诈政策和“和谈”阴谋接连遭到挫败，但是它并没有死心。覃应机说，我们必须对美帝国主义保持高度的警惕，作好各项准备工作，随时准备反对美帝国主义把战争强加在我国人民头上。他还表示坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底。他说，不管发生什么惊涛骇浪，我们同全国人民一起，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民，直到彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略。
