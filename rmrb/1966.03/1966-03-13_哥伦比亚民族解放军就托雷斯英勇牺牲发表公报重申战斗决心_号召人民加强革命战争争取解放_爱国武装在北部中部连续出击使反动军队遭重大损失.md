    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th, Bogotá dispatch: The Colombian National Liberation Army recently issued a communiqué regarding the heroic sacrifice of the prominent Colombian figure Camilo Torres in battle, stating that Camilo's murder "fills our hearts with fighting resolve and hatred for the oligarchy's military police," and that the National Liberation Army will "never retreat a step, vowing to fight for liberation to the death."

    The communiqué stated that thousands of people will "take the positions left by this heroic warrior in the National Liberation Army."

    Camilo Torres was previously a priest and professor, and one of the leaders of the Colombian "United Front Movement." At the beginning of this year, he joined the National Liberation Army, becoming one of the leaders of this anti-government guerrilla force. In a declaration after joining the army, he announced that what he sought was "to liberate the people from exploitation, the oligarchy, and imperialism."

    The National Liberation Army's communiqué stated that Camilo Torres, along with four other brave patriots, unfortunately and gloriously sacrificed his life in a fierce battle on February 15th. In this battle, the warriors of the National Liberation Army bravely repelled another encirclement by government troops, inflicting many casualties on them and capturing some long-range weapons and other equipment. The communiqué said, "Camilo died like a hero," and that "the Colombian people have made enormous efforts to free themselves from the shameful shackles of the oligarchy and U.S. imperialism, and have had to offer the blood of their excellent sons and daughters to the altar of the interests of the motherland." However, the people will reduce those who murdered him to "powder and dust" and "strengthen the will to fight to final victory." The communiqué called on people to learn from Camilo's example as a leader, not fearing sacrifice, personally participating in armed struggle, learning from his scientific insight that revolutionary war is the only effective means of struggle for liberation, and from his insistence on the unity of all Colombian people to carry out the struggle. The communiqué called on people from all walks of life to unite, organize, and vow to fight to seize political power. The communiqué also called on all people's organizations to strongly demand that the government return Camilo's body.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th, Bogotá dispatch: Colombian guerrillas have recently continued to launch attacks, inflicting losses on the government's reactionary troops.

    According to reports, in the Barrancode Lova district of Bolívar Province in the north, guerrillas successfully ambushed a patrol of the National Police at the beginning of this month. According to official announcements, two soldiers from the patrol were killed. Guerrilla activity has developed in this province since the beginning of this year.

    A guerrilla force active near the city of San Vicente de Chucurí in the province of Norte de Santander in the north successfully ambushed a motorcycle patrol of the Fifth Brigade, which was "encircling" the guerrillas, at the end of February.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th, Bogotá dispatch: Colombian patriotic guerrillas continue to constantly strike at the reactionary government troops in the central and northern regions.

    On the 4th, a patriotic guerrilla force fought with government troops near the Chaparral region of Tolima Province, wounding two government soldiers. In mid-February, the Colombian National Liberation Army ambushed a patrol of government troops in the jurisdiction of San Vicente de Chucurí in Santander Province, and attacked a village in Magdalena Province. According to a communiqué issued by the Colombian Ministry of Defense on March 1st, it admitted that government troops had been killed by guerrillas twenty-one times in the first two months of this year, and fourteen had been wounded, including nine officers among the casualties.

    哥伦比亚民族解放军就托雷斯英勇牺牲发表公报重申战斗决心
    号召人民加强革命战争争取解放
    爱国武装在北部中部连续出击使反动军队遭重大损失
    新华社十二日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚民族解放军最近就哥伦比亚著名人士卡米洛·托雷斯在战斗中英勇牺牲一事发表公报说，卡米洛的被杀害“使我们心中充满了战斗的决心和对寡头势力的军警们的仇恨”，民族解放军将“决不后退一步，誓死争取解放”。
    公报说，数以千计的人将“接替这位英雄战士在民族解放军中留下的岗位”。
    卡米洛·托雷斯过去是一位神父和教授，是哥伦比亚“统一战线运动”的领导人之一。今年年初，他参加了民族解放军，成为这支反政府游击武装的领导人之一。他入伍后在一项宣言中宣布，他所寻求的是“使人民摆脱剥削、寡头集团和帝国主义而取得解放”。
    民族解放军的公报说，卡米洛·托雷斯是在二月十五日一场激烈的战斗中和另外四位勇敢的爱国者一起不幸光荣牺牲的。在这场战斗中，民族解放军的战士勇敢地击退了政府军的另一次围剿，给他们造成了许多伤亡，缴获了一些远射程武器和其它装备。公报说，“卡米洛是象英雄那样去世的”，“哥伦比亚人民为了摆脱寡头势力和美帝国主义的可耻枷锁进行了巨大努力，不得不把自己优秀儿女的鲜血献给祖国利益的祭坛”。但是，人民将使杀害他的那些罪魁“粉身碎骨”，并“加强战斗到最后胜利的意志”。公报号召人们学习卡米洛作为一个领导人以身作则，不怕牺牲，亲自参加武装斗争的精神，学习他的这种科学见解：即革命战争是争取解放的斗争的唯一有效手段，以及他竭力主张的全体哥伦比亚人民团结起来进行斗争的主张。公报号召各阶层人民团结起来，组织起来，誓死为夺取政权而斗争。公报还号召各人民团体强烈要求政府归还卡米洛的尸体。
    据新华社十二日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚游击队最近继续出击，使政府的反动军队遭受损失。
    据报道，在北部的博利瓦尔省的巴兰科德洛瓦区，游击队在本月初成功地伏击了国民警察的巡逻队。据官方宣布，巡逻队的两名士兵被打死。游击活动是今年年初发展到这个省的。
    活跃在北部桑坦德省圣维森特德丘库里市附近的一支游击队二月底胜利地伏击了“围剿”游击队的第五旅的一支摩托车巡逻队。
    据新华社十日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚爱国游击队继续在中部和北部地区不断打击反动的政府军。
    四日，一支爱国游击队在托利马省查帕拉尔地区附近同政府军打了一仗，打伤了两名政府军士兵。二月中旬，哥伦比亚民族解放军在桑坦德省圣维森特德丘库里市管辖区内伏击了政府军的一支巡逻队，并在马格达莱纳省袭击了一个村庄。据哥伦比亚国防部三月一日发表的公报承认，政府军在今年头两个月里被游击队打死二十一名，打伤十四名，其中包括伤亡的军官九名。
