    Thinking of the Whole World
    —Words from Family Members of Daqing Workers
    Living for the revolution, life is worth a thousand gold pieces; living for oneself is not worth a needle. Whether gold or needle, action provides the conclusion.
  The moon cannot shine without the sun,
  seedlings will wither without rain.
  If family members engage in revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works,
  they will lose their way.
  In the past, the eyes saw only a room,
  the heart thought only of husband and children; now the eyes see all of China, the heart thinks of the whole world. Hanging one's mouth on others will not bring true equality. For women to be completely liberated, they must participate in collective productive labor.

### 心里想着全世界——大庆职工家属的话

专栏：

    心里想着全世界
    ——大庆职工家属的话活着为革命，生命值千金；活着为个人，不如一根针；是金还是针，行动作结论。月亮离开了太阳就不能发
  光，禾苗离开了雨水就要枯
  黄，家属闹革命不学毛主席著
  作就要迷失方向。过去眼里看的是一间房
  子，心里想的是丈夫和孩子；现在眼里看到全中国，心里想着全世界。把嘴巴挂在别人身上，不会有真正的平等，妇女要彻底解放，必须参加集体生产劳动。
