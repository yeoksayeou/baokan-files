    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 18th (by dispatch from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency): Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, issued an appeal on the 16th anniversary of Vietnam's National Anti-US Struggle Day (March 19th), calling on the entire people to vigorously promote the Anti-US National Salvation Movement and resolutely defeat the US imperialist war of aggression under any circumstances, so as to achieve the noble goal of liberating the South, defending the North, and then unifying the motherland.

    The appeal pointed out that the "March 19th" anti-US struggle proves that the military force of US imperialism is not terrible. Our people can defeat it. Today, our people are directly fighting hundreds of thousands of US troops and their puppet troops, and have inflicted a disastrous defeat on them, making it impossible for them to escape the fate of complete failure.

    The appeal said, "This struggle demonstrates the endless potential and invincible power of our people, proving that once our people unite closely and fight resolutely, they can completely defeat all enemies, even if it is the head of imperialism - US imperialism."

    The appeal said that the US imperialist strategy of "special warfare" has been completely bankrupt. Its conspiracy to attack and destroy North Vietnam cannot shake the people of both the North and the South. On the contrary, our people are even more determined to oppose it. Its deceptive "peace talks" have been exposed in front of our people and the people of the world. People of the five continents strongly condemn its war of aggression. The American people are also rising up more and more resolutely against it. US imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation. Its internal contradictions are numerous and constantly quarreling with each other.

    The appeal expressed heartfelt gratitude for the extensive activities of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world in supporting the Vietnamese people against the US aggressors. The appeal pointed out that our military and civilians are becoming stronger and more victorious as they fight. Today, our people are winning victories and will surely achieve final victory.

    The appeal called on the Liberation Armed Forces to fight bravely and continuously, annihilate more enemy forces, actively build and fully develop their own strength, so as to defeat the US expeditionary forces, crush the puppet army, and defend and liberate the people.

    The appeal called on the people of South Vietnam to unite closely, fight bravely, resolutely smash the enemy's "pacification" conspiracy to nibble away at the liberated areas, and destroy the remaining "strategic hamlets." The appeal called on the people of the southern cities to carry forward the glorious tradition of "March 19th" and use political violence and armed forces to drive away the US aggressors and their running dogs.

    The appeal also called on personnel of the puppet regime and puppet army to quickly awaken, return to the embrace of the people, and participate in the Anti-US National Salvation struggle.

    阮友寿主席为纪念越南全国反美斗争日发表号召书
    促进抗美救国运动打败美帝侵略战争
    号召解放武装力量英勇持续战斗消灭敌人更多有生力量
    新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿为纪念越南全国反美斗争日（三月十九日）十六周年发表号召书，号召全民大力促进抗美救国运动，在任何情况下，都坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，实现解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的崇高目的。
    号召书指出，“三·一九”的反美斗争证明，美帝国主义的武力并不可怕。我国人民是可以把它打败的。今天，我国人民直接同几十万美军和它的走狗军队作战，已经把它们打得惨败，使它们无法摆脱彻底失败的命运。
    号召书说，“这一斗争显示了我国人民的无穷无尽的潜力和无敌力量，证明我国人民一旦紧密团结、坚决斗争，就完全可以击败一切敌人，尽管它是帝国主义头子——美帝国主义。”
    号召书说，美帝国主义的“特种战争”战略已彻底破产。它袭击、破坏越南北方的阴谋完全不能使南北两方人民动摇，相反，我国人民更加坚决反对它。它的“和谈”骗人手段已在我国人民和世界人民面前被揭露。五大洲人民强烈谴责它的侵略战争。美国人民也日益坚决地起来反对它。美帝国主义已陷于空前的孤立。它的内部矛盾重重，不断地互相争吵。
    号召书表示衷心感谢亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和世界人民的支持越南人民反对美国侵略者的广泛活动。号召书指出，我国军民越战越强，越战越胜。今天，我国人民正在取得胜利，并一定取得最后胜利。
    号召书号召解放武装力量英勇和持续地进行战斗，消灭敌人更多的有生力量，积极建设和充分发展自己的力量，以打垮美国远征军，击溃伪军，保卫和解放人民。
    号召书号召越南南方人民紧密团结，英勇斗争，坚决粉碎敌人蚕食解放区的“绥靖”阴谋，摧毁残存的“战略村”。号召书号召南方城市人民发扬“三·一九”的光荣传统，用政治暴力和武装力量来把美国侵略者及其走狗赶走。
    号召书还号召伪政权和伪军人员赶快觉悟过来，回到人民的怀抱，参加抗美救国斗争。
