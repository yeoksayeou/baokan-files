    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: An Air Force unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army solemnly held a celebration and award ceremony today in a certain area of Southwest China, warmly celebrating the victory of shooting down a US imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft on March 23rd, commending the meritorious units and personnel in the battle, and encouraging all commanders and fighters to make persistent efforts and strive to create greater victories in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace.
    Chang Qiankun, Deputy Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tian Weiyang, person in charge of the local troops, and persons in charge of the local Party, government, and garrison attended the meeting.
    At the meeting, Tian Weiyang read out the commendation order issued by Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, to the meritorious combat troops. Chang Qiankun and Tian Weiyang presented the certificates of merit to the meritorious units and personnel respectively. At this time, prolonged applause resounded throughout the venue, congratulating the awarded units and individuals.
    Chang Qiankun spoke at the meeting. He said that the victory in this battle was a major victory achieved in less than twenty days, following the downing of a US imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft by our air force in the Central and Southern regions on March 5th. It gave another severe punishment to the American aggressors who are recklessly expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and are increasingly frequently carrying out military provocations against our country. This is the result of your holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implementing Vice Chairman Lin Biao's five principles of giving prominence to politics. He pointed out that this victory once again eloquently proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the best weapon, and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, and give prominence to politics everywhere, we can be invincible at any time and under any conditions. He called on all air force units to earnestly study the experience of combat troops in giving prominence to politics and winning battles, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and being constantly prepared; to take Chairman Mao's works as the supreme instructions for all work; to take Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu as examples; to dedicate our hearts to the people, kill the enemy with hatred, and strive to shoot down more enemy planes, making contributions to the revolutionary cause of the people of all China and the world.
    In his speech, Tian Weiyang, on behalf of the local Party, government, army, and people of all ethnic groups, warmly praised the major victory achieved by the air force in the struggle to defend the southwestern airspace of the motherland. He said that we must earnestly study the experience of the air force units participating in the war in giving prominence to politics and winning battles, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the activities of learning from Jiao Yulu more solidly, accelerate the revolutionization of leading ideology, accelerate the "three implementations" of militia work, and resolutely eliminate all enemies who dare to invade.
    Zhu Yilong, representative of the meritorious combat personnel, said in his speech that he must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to make progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," study Chairman Mao's books more conscientiously, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be ready for battle at any time, no matter when the enemy comes, we will eliminate as many as they come.

    空军某部隆重举行祝捷授奖大会
    新华社二十六日讯  中国人民解放军空军某部，今天在西南地区某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，热烈庆祝三月二十三日击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机的胜利，表扬在战斗中有功的单位和有功人员，勉励全体指战员再接再励，在保卫祖国领空的战斗中，争取创造更大的胜利。
    中国人民解放军空军副司令员常乾坤、当地部队负责人田维扬和当地党、政府和驻军的负责人出席了大会。
    会上，田维扬宣读了国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志颁发给作战有功部队的嘉奖令。常乾坤和田维扬分别把奖状发给立功的单位和人员。这时，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声，向受奖的单位和个人表示祝贺。
    常乾坤在大会上讲话。他说，这次战斗的胜利，是继我空军部队三月五日在中南地区击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机以后，不到二十天的时间里，又取得的一次重大胜利。它给了正在冒险扩大侵略越南战争，越来越频繁地向我国进行军事挑衅的美国侵略者又一次严厉的惩罚。这是你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻林彪副主席关于突出政治的五项原则所取得的成果。他指出，这次胜利再次雄辩地证明了，毛泽东思想就是最好的武器，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就是最大的战斗力。只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，处处突出政治，就能在任何时候，任何条件下所向无敌。他号召空军各部队，认真学习作战部队突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，常备不懈的经验，以毛主席著作为各项工作的最高指示，以雷锋、王杰、麦贤得和焦裕禄为榜样，掏尽红心为人民，满怀仇恨杀敌人，争取打下更多的敌机，为全中国和全世界人民的革命事业作出贡献。
    田维扬在讲话中，代表当地党、政府、军队和各族人民，热烈赞扬空军部队在保卫祖国西南领空的斗争中所取得的重大胜利。他说，我们要认真学习参战的空军部队突出政治打胜仗的经验，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，把学习焦裕禄的活动开展得更加扎实，加速领导思想革命化，加速民兵工作“三落实”，坚决消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    作战有功人员代表朱以隆在讲话中表示，一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，更加认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，随时作好战斗准备，不管敌人什么时候来，来多少就消灭它多少。
