    Gujiazi Branch Implements the Method of the Communist Youth League Leading the Young Pioneers
    The Youth Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Department of Student and Children Affairs of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Working Group of the Gaixian County Committee of the Communist Youth League
    The Gujiazi Brigade Branch of the Communist Youth League in Gaixian County, Liaoning Province, is a model of the "Four Good" League Branches in Liaoning Province. They have also achieved great success in leading the Young Pioneers work.
    At first, the League branch committee members worried that their education level was low, that they didn't understand education, and that they couldn't lead. They studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem, and understood that the Young Pioneers were a school for children to learn communism, and that children should be guided to be tempered in revolutionary struggles. Once they understood this principle, their minds were suddenly enlightened. The League branch committee members said: "We can lead the Young Pioneers to make revolution." For more than a year, the Gujiazi League branch has worked hard to study Chairman Mao's writings, constantly practice, and constantly summarize experience, making the Young Pioneers work very active.
      Teach the Class Education Lesson Well
    In the past, some children randomly called old poor peasants nicknames and could not clearly distinguish between landlords and rich peasants. The League branch analyzed the children's situation and believed that class education should be carried out. They invited old poor peasants with deep hatred to tell the team members their family history, organized team members to investigate village history, and visited class education exhibitions to understand the class relations in the village in the old society, enhancing the team members' class feelings of loving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Class education proved effective, so the League branch further carried out class education activities. Five old poor peasants were invited to be fixed class instructors, and 81 poor peasant households in the village were mobilized to tell the children their family history full of blood and tears.
    The League branch used the facts of the current class struggle to educate children. A landlord element mixed sand into the manure he handed over to the production team. The deputy secretary of the League branch told the team members about this incident at the Young Pioneers meeting. A landlord element escaped to other places to do bad things and was sent back to the village to supervise labor. The League branch promptly told the team members about his crimes in the old society and his current sabotage activities.
    Last year, during a severe drought, a member of the Communist Youth League was asked by his father to fetch water from the canal to irrigate his private plot. He thought, "If everyone comes to fetch water, the production team's paddy fields will dry up." His father chased him three times, but he returned with empty buckets each time. The League branch publicized the deeds of this League member among the team members and organized the team members to discuss "Is it right to use the water from the canal to irrigate private plots during a drought?" This gave the team members a vivid education in loving the collective.
    In conjunction with class education, organize team members to study Chairman Mao's relevant quotations. For example, when telling the story of land reform and fighting landlords, the team members were organized to study Chairman Mao's quotation "All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall." When talking about the sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants, they studied the quotation "After the enemy with guns is eliminated, the enemy without guns still exists." The team members said: "What class says what words. Landlords and rich peasants can't do good things. We must be vigilant."
  Striving to Build a New Socialist Countryside
    Some children do not love labor. The League branch feels that it is necessary to educate children to establish the lofty ideal of changing the face of their hometowns with their own hands and building a new socialist countryside. They drew three maps and asked the Party branch secretary to explain to the team members the struggle of all the villagers to transform the world. The first picture shows Gujiazi before liberation, with sand dunes, waterlogged depressions, and graves everywhere, a desolate scene; the second picture shows the current Gujiazi, with sand dunes moved away, waterlogged depressions converted into paddy fields, flood control embankments built, fruit trees planted, electric wells drilled, and canals dug; the third picture shows the future Gujiazi, with paddy fields in front and behind the village, grapes on the vines, fruits on the branches, and guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood. The past and future vision of the hometown makes the team members love agricultural labor even more and determined to contribute to changing the face of the countryside. The League branch promptly guided this enthusiasm of the team members into labor. When the villagers were controlling mountains and rivers, the Young Pioneers planted trees and afforested; when the villagers were preparing for plowing, the Young Pioneers collected manure and accumulated fertilizer; when the villagers were busy with summer hoeing, the Young Pioneers pulled grass and caught insects; when the villagers were busy with autumn harvest, the Young Pioneers carried out grain-picking activities. The team members said: "Working hard to build a new socialist countryside, the more we work, the more we love to work, and the more energy we have."
    In labor, carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological education in response to living ideas. When selecting seeds, some team members were not serious, so they were told the principle of "good seeds produce good seedlings." Some team members were afraid of being tired, so they were told the story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." When transplanting rice seedlings, the team members were told about the model deeds of League members' arduous labor. When the Young Pioneers' experimental fields were applying manure, some team members were afraid of getting dirty and smelly, so the League branch secretary took the lead in doing dirty and tiring work. After the labor, he said to the team members: "People who are afraid of dirt and odor and do not love labor will have their thoughts become smelly bit by bit in the future." With living examples and patient persuasion and education, the education of loving labor becomes vivid and profound.
  Care for Children's Studies and Lives
    For a period of time, parents and schools asked the League branch to manage the studies of the team members. The League branch committee members held a meeting to study the Party's educational policy and summarized the previous stage of the Young Pioneers' work. They felt that they had not grasped it comprehensively in the past and that they should comprehensively manage the studies and lives of children.
    The League branch and the school jointly strengthened ideological education for children to study hard. Some team members did not value learning, saying, "It doesn't matter whether you study well or not, you can earn work points the same way." The League branch invited old poor peasants to talk about the suffering of generations being "blind people" without education; invited returned educated youth to talk about the importance of culture in farming, inspiring team members to study diligently for the revolution. They also organized team members to discuss issues such as "What is the relationship between learning and revolution?" and told the stories of Lei Feng's hard study and the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to educate team members to overcome difficulties in learning.
      "There is learning in farming, and you can learn a lot of knowledge that you can't learn in the classroom." The League branch opened up a seven-point paddy field as an experimental field for the Young Pioneers, invited old poor peasants and educated youth to be technical advisors, and arranged comparative experiments of scattered application of chemical fertilizers and spherical fertilizers, and experiments of single-plant and multi-plant transplanting. Scientific and technological groups such as electricians and veterinarians were established. The electricians of the production brigade were invited to give the electrician group lectures on the basics of electricity and teach some repair techniques. The members of the veterinary group, led by the epidemic prevention worker, learned how to prevent hog cholera and vaccinated livestock. These activities combined book knowledge with practical knowledge for children. They learned vividly and with interest.
    The League branch mobilized young people to help the Young Pioneers carry out cultural and sports activities. The military sports committee member was responsible for the "Little Militia" activities of the Young Pioneers, leading the team members to learn military techniques and carry out military games. League members who were good at sports helped the Young Pioneers establish basketball teams and table tennis teams, and held ball game competitions and small sports meets. Young people who loved literature and art helped the Young Pioneers establish the "Red Scarf Little Troupe." The League branch also sent a young man to be a singing teacher, carrying out large-scale revolutionary song singing activities in the Young Pioneers.
      Positive Guidance, Praise and Encouragement
    Some children have some fights and scolding. How should we treat them? The League branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "The attitude of Communists towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to be close to them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." They also recalled the example of finally educating the backward youth Yu Yuejiang well and joining the League after seven years. They realized that "for children, we should be like regulating water. Blocking is not a solution. We must repair the channels and guide it to flow to useful places!"
    The League branch committee members make friends with children with shortcomings on an equal footing to help them make progress. Team member An Guoshan was very naughty. Wang Jiuyun took the initiative to make friends with him, gave him Lei Feng's Diary, and told him the principle of uniting with children. With his patient help, An Guoshan became a good boy. Several team members often played table tennis until late at night, and the next day they did not go to school and slept on the sandy hill outside the village. The League branch organized a table tennis team for them, let them study Xu Yinsheng's speech, set their own rules, abide by them together, and organized them to compete in other villages. As a result, this group of naughty children listened to the League branch and made progress.
    The League branch educates children by mainly praising them. Jiang Xingmao was a child with many shortcomings. Some people said: "If you can educate such a child well, you will become living gods." However, the League branch did not think so. Children with more shortcomings also have many advantages. They should be viewed in two parts. One day, the lock of the school classroom was broken, and Jiang Xingmao brought the lock from his home to the school. When the League branch heard about it, they immediately praised him. Jiang Xingmao did a lot of good things in a row and was praised. With the help and education of the League branch, he became an excellent team member.
      Let Team Members Learn to Be Masters
    To let the Young Pioneers be masters in the team, the League branch must respect the team members' democratic rights. This understanding was gained from lessons. The commune League committee was preparing to convene a Young Pioneers representative meeting, and the League branch did not determine the representatives through democratic elections by the team members. As soon as the list was announced, the team members muttered, "This is too undemocratic." The League branch committee immediately held a meeting to review and publicly apologized to the team members and decided to re-elect democratically. The team members were very satisfied and said, "The League branch handles things reasonably." This incident made the League branch realize that the Young Pioneers are the children's own organization. Although the children are young, they must also exercise their democratic rights, and in leading the Young Pioneers' work, they must fully promote democracy and give play to the children's enthusiasm so that they can develop a democratic style from an early age.
    To let the Young Pioneers be masters in the team, we must cultivate Young Pioneers cadres and let them lead the team members to carry out activities. The League branch deeply realized that the Young Pioneers cadres are also children. They have advantages and disadvantages. It is unrealistic to ask them to be good in everything. They should be enthusiastically helped in practical work. Young Pioneers Deputy Brigade Captain Zou Suzhen quarreled with others when transplanting rice seedlings because a few mud spots splashed on her new clothes. The League branch held a meeting to study and decided that Young Pioneers Committee Member Hua Yuzhen would help her. Hua Yuzhen said to her, "Mud spots on clothes can be washed off, but mud spots on thoughts are dangerous." Zou Suzhen was very grateful for the League branch's help. Later, she always strictly demanded herself and was recently elected as the League branch secretary.

    实行以团带队的古家子团支部
    共青团中央少年部、共青团辽宁省委学少部、共青团盖县县委工作组
    辽宁省盖县古家子大队团支部，是辽宁省四好团支部的标兵。在领导少先队工作上也取得很大成绩。
    开始的时候，团支委们顾虑自己文化低，不懂教育，怕领导不了。他们带着这个问题，学习毛主席著作，懂得了少先队是儿童们学习共产主义的学校，要引导少年儿童在革命斗争中经受锻炼。明白了这个道理，思想豁然开朗。团支委们说：“领着队员干革命，我们能行。”一年多来，古家子团支部努力学习毛主席著作，不断实践，不断总结经验，把少先队工作搞得十分活跃。
      上好阶级教育这一课
    以前，有些孩子乱叫老贫农的外号，对地主富农划不清界限。团支部分析了孩子们的情况，认为应当进行阶级教育。他们请苦大仇深的老贫农给队员们讲家史，组织队员调查村史，参观阶级教育展览会，了解旧社会本村的阶级关系，增强了队员们热爱贫下中农的阶级感情，阶级教育灵验了，团支部就进一步开展了阶级教育活动。请五个老贫农作为固定的阶级教员，还发动全村八十一户贫农都给孩子讲了血泪斑斑的家史。
    团支部运用现实的阶级斗争事实教育少年儿童。一个地主分子往生产队交粪掺上了沙子，团支部副书记在少先队会上给队员们讲了这件事。一个地主分子逃到外地干坏事，被送回本村监督劳动，团支部就及时把他在旧社会的罪恶和现在的破坏活动告诉队员。
    去年大旱，有个共青团员，他父亲让他到水渠挑水浇自留地。他想：“大家都来挑水，生产队稻田就干了。”父亲撵他去了三次，他都担着空桶回来了。团支部在队员中宣传了这个团员的事迹，组织队员讨论了“天旱用水渠的水浇自留地对不对？”使队员受到一次生动的热爱集体的教育。
    结合阶级教育，组织队员学习毛主席的有关语录。例如，在讲土改斗地主的故事的时候，组织队员学习了毛主席的“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的语录，在讲地主、富农分子的破坏活动的时候，学习了“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”的语录。队员们说：“什么阶级说什么话，地主、富农干不出好事，一定得提高警惕。”
  为建设社会主义新农村出力
    有些孩子不热爱劳动，团支部感到，必须教育少年儿童树立用自己的双手，改变家乡面貌，建设社会主义新农村的远大理想。他们画了三张地图，请党支部书记给队员讲解全村社员改天换地的斗争。第一张画的是解放前的古家子，到处是沙丘、涝洼、坟地，一片荒凉；第二张画的是现在的古家子，搬走了沙丘，涝洼地改成水田，修起防洪堤，种上果树，打了电井，挖了水渠；第三张画的是未来的古家子，村前村后是水田，葡萄满架果满枝，旱涝保丰收。家乡的过去和未来的远景，使队员们更加热爱农业劳动，决心为改变农村面貌出一分力。团支部及时把队员们这种热情，引导到劳动中去。社员们治山治水，少先队就植树造林；社员们备耕，少先队就拣粪积肥；社员们夏锄大忙，少先队就拔草、捉虫；社员们忙秋收，少先队就开展拣粮活动。队员们说：“为建设社会主义新农村劳动，越干越爱干，越干越有劲。”
    在劳动中，针对活思想，进行深入细致的思想教育。选种时，有的队员不认真，就给他们讲“好种出好苗”的道理。有的队员怕累，就讲《愚公移山》的故事。插秧时给队员讲团员艰苦劳动的模范事迹。少先队试验田施大粪时，有的队员怕脏怕臭，团支部书记带头干脏活、累活。劳动后，他对队员们说：“怕脏怕臭、不爱劳动的人，将来思想就会一点一点变臭。”有了活生生的榜样，又有了耐心的说服教育，热爱劳动的教育就生动了，深刻了。
  关心少年儿童的学习和生活
    有一段时间，家长和学校要求团支部管队员的学习。团支委开会学习了党的教育方针，总结了前一段少先队的工作，感到过去抓得不全面，应当把少年儿童的学习和生活全面管起来。
    团支部和学校一起对少年儿童加强了学好功课的思想教育。有些队员不重视学习，说：“学习好坏没关系，一样劳动挣工分。”团支部请老贫农讲了祖祖辈辈当“睁眼瞎”，没文化的苦；请回乡知识青年讲种田要有文化的道理，启发队员们为革命勤奋学习。还组织队员讨论了“学习与革命有什么关系”等问题，讲了雷锋刻苦学习和愚公移山的故事，教育队员克服学习上的困难。
      “种田里边有学问，能学到很多课堂上学不到的知识。”团支部给少先队开辟了一块七分地的水稻试验田，请老贫农和知识青年做技术顾问，安排了散施化肥和施球肥的对比试验，单株和多株插秧的试验。建立了电工、兽医等科学技术小组，请生产大队电工给电工小组讲电的常识，教给一些修理技术。兽医小组的队员，在防疫员带领下，学习防猪瘟的办法，给牲畜打针。这些活动使少年儿童把书本知识和实际知识结合起来，他们学得生动了，也学得有味了。
    团支部发动青年帮助少先队开展文化体育活动。军体委员负责少先队的“小民兵”活动，领导队员学习军事技术和开展军事游戏。擅长体育的团员帮助少先队建立了篮球队、乒乓球队，举行球类比赛和小运动会。爱好文艺的青年，帮助少先队建立了“红领巾小剧团”。团支部还派了一名青年当教歌员，在少先队里开展大唱革命歌曲活动。
      正面引导　表扬鼓励
    有些孩子发生一些打架骂人的事情。应该怎样对待他们？团支部组织大家学习了毛主席语录“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”又回忆了用七年时间终于把后进青年于跃江教育好，入了团的事例。认识到“对于孩子要象调理水一样，堵不是个办法，要修好渠道，引它往有用处流！”
    团支委以平等态度同有缺点的孩子交朋友，帮助他们进步。队员安国山很调皮，王久云主动和他交了朋友，送给他雷锋日记，给他讲要和小朋友团结的道理。安国山在他耐心帮助下，变成了好孩子。有几个队员，时常打乒乓球到深更半夜，第二天不上学，到村外沙岗睡大觉。团支部给他们组织了一个乒乓球队，让他们学习徐寅生的讲话，自己订立规矩，共同遵守，还组织他们到外村比赛。这样一来，这群顽皮的孩子，听团支部的话了，都有了进步。
    团支部教育少年儿童，采取以表扬为主的办法。姜兴茂是个缺点较多的孩子。有人说：“能把这样的孩子教育好，你们就成了活神仙了。”团支部却不这样想。缺点较多的孩子也有许多优点，应该一分为二地看待孩子。一天，学校教室的锁坏了，姜兴茂把自己家里的锁拿到学校。团支部听到后马上表扬了他，姜兴茂一连串做了不少好事，都得到了表扬，在团支部帮助教育下，成为优秀队员。
      让队员学习当家作主
    要让少先队员在队里当家作主，团支部要尊重队员的民主权利。这个认识是从教训中取得的。公社团委准备召开少先队员代表大会，团支部没有经队员民主选举确定了代表。名单一宣布，队员就嘀咕起来，说：“这太不民主了。”团支委立即开会作了检查，并且公开向队员检讨，决定重新民主选举。队员非常满意，都说：“团支部办事就是讲道理。”这件事，使团支部认识到，少先队是少年儿童自己的组织，孩子们年纪虽小，也要行使民主权利，在领导少先队工作中必须充分发扬民主，发挥少年儿童的积极性，让他们从小养成民主的作风。
    让少先队员在队里当家作主，就要培养少先队干部，让他们带领队员开展活动。团支部深深体会到，少先队的干部也是小孩子，他们有优点，也有缺点，要求他们样样都好是不切实际的，要在实际工作中热情地帮助他们。少先队副大队长邹素珍在插秧的时候，因为新衣服上溅上几个泥点，就和别人吵起来，团支部开会研究，决定由少年委员花玉珍帮助她，花玉珍对她说：“衣服上沾了泥点可以洗掉，思想上沾了泥点就危险了。”邹素珍很感激团支部的帮助，以后总是严格要求自己，最近被选为团支部书记。
