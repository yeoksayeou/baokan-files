    Taking the Lead in Applying Mao Zedong Thought Well
    Chen Junxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Baisha County Committee, Guangdong

    Baisha County is an old revolutionary base area with revolutionary traditions. It has abundant rainfall, a mild climate, is evergreen throughout the year, and has vast and fertile land, with relatively good natural conditions. However, the level of grain production is relatively low. I have been working in this county for several years, but I have not yet figured out the rules for changing Baisha's face. I always thought that ethnic minority areas had less labor and the masses had lower consciousness, so changes should be made slowly. I didn't have the deep class feelings like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and I didn't creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to change the subjective world and the objective world with Mao Zedong Thought. In my work, I didn't pay attention to highlighting politics, mistakenly believing that if production was good, politics would also be good.

    In the future, I must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. I will insist on reading and applying them every day, taking the lead in studying and applying them. Secondly, I will promote democracy, follow the mass line, conduct investigations and research, comprehensively understand the natural laws of Baisha County, and change the face of Baisha County as soon as possible.

    带头用好毛泽东思想
    广东白沙县委副书记　陈俊祥
    白沙县是革命的老根据地，有革命传统；雨水充沛，气候温和，四季常青，土地广阔肥沃，自然条件也比较好的，但是，粮食生产水平比较低。我在这个县工作几年了，还没有摸出改变白沙面貌的规律。我总认为民族地区劳力少，群众觉悟低，要改变嘛，应该慢慢来。我没有象焦裕禄同志那样带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改变主观世界和客观世界。在工作中不注意突出政治，错误地认为生产好，政治也会好。
    今后，我一定要活学活用毛主席著作。坚持天天读，天天用，带头学，带头用。其次，发扬民主，走群众路线，调查研究，全面摸清白沙县的自然规律，尽快改变白沙县的面貌。
