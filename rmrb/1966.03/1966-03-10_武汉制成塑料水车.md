    Wuhan Makes Plastic Waterwheels
    A new type of waterwheel – the polyvinyl chloride plastic waterwheel – has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Hubei Xinsheng Plastics Factory. This waterwheel has been used continuously at varying speeds in rural Hubei, and no mechanical damage has occurred.
    This plastic waterwheel is made mainly of plastic, supplemented with iron parts, making it light and flexible. The entire waterwheel and its accessories weigh only forty kilograms, and can be moved by one person.
    When using this waterwheel, it can be used to draw water wherever it is simply fixed; while wooden waterwheels are more difficult to fix, and installation takes longer.
    The plastic pipe of the plastic waterwheel is enclosed, which not only saves effort in drawing water, but also produces a large amount of water. A plastic waterwheel generally only requires one or two people to operate, but the water drawing efficiency is about twice as high as that of a three-person treadle-operated wooden waterwheel.
    This waterwheel is corrosion-resistant, acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and rust-free, which can save a lot of maintenance costs.

    武汉制成塑料水车
    一种结构新颖的水车——聚氯乙烯塑料水车，最近在湖北新生塑料厂试制成功。这种水车在湖北农村采用不同速度连续试用，没有发生任何机械损坏。
    这种塑料水车是以塑料为主，配以铁零件装制而成的，轻巧灵便。全副水车和附件总共只有四十公斤重，一个人就可以搬动。
    使用这种水车的时候，不论在什么地方，只需简单固定就可车水；而木制水车固定比较困难，安装时间也比较长。
    塑料水车的塑料管是封闭式的，不仅车水省力，而且出水量大。一部塑料水车一般只需一人或两人操作，而车水效率要比一部三人脚踏木制水车高一倍左右。
    这种水车抗腐蚀，耐酸、耐碱，不生锈，使用起来可以节省不少维修费用。
