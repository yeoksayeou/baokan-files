    The Sports Front Decides to Launch a New Upsurge of Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works in a Living Way
    Adhering to Giving Prominence to Politics and Accelerating the Revolutionization of Sports Teams
    Vice Premier He Long pointed out at the National Sports Work Conference: Studying Chairman Mao's works should be conscious, frequent, and linked to reality, especially making great efforts in "application."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th—The 1966 National Sports Work Conference recently held in Beijing called on sports workers and athletes across the country to unswervingly give prominence to politics, regard Chairman Mao's works as the supreme instructions for sports work, and take the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the most urgent, most important, and most fundamental task in all sports work, and launch a new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a more extensive, deeper, and more effective way.
    Vice Premier He Long gave important instructions to the conference. He pointed out that the five principles of giving prominence to politics put forward by Comrade Lin Biao are completely suitable for sports teams. Sports teams from top to bottom must earnestly study and implement them. He demanded that sports teams must continue to emphasize learning from the People's Liberation Army, especially learning from the People's Liberation Army's experience in giving prominence to politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, vigorously grasping the "four firsts," the "three-eight" work style, and the experiences of "four goods" and "five goods."
    Regarding the question of how to give prominence to politics and study and apply Chairman Mao's works well in sports teams, Vice Premier He Long reiterated that studying Chairman Mao's works should be conscious, frequent, and linked to reality, especially making great efforts in "application," first of all, transforming one's world outlook. If people's thinking is transformed well, and they have a correct world outlook, they can grasp correct ideological methods and cultivate a good work style, and other problems can be readily solved. Departing from politics and Mao Zedong Thought means losing direction and making mistakes. In the future, whether the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and sports commissions at all levels are arranging work, summarizing work, or holding meetings, they must give prominence to politics, let ideology lead, and check how well the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is being done.
    In accordance with the instructions of Vice Premier He Long, the conference unfolded criticism and self-criticism in the spirit of rectification, exchanged and summarized experiences, and affirmed the achievements of China's sports cause in 1965. At the same time, the conference believed that the sports front still lags behind other advanced units in learning Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, it requires sports workers and athletes to study Chairman Mao's works with a clear class stand and class feelings, and with problems in mind, just like the People's Liberation Army, Daqing people, and Dazhai people. The purpose of learning is all for application. It is necessary to use it to transform the thinking of sports teams, so that sports teams become a revolutionary force that is both red and expert, and use ideological revolutionization to drive the revolutionization of sports work.
    The representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that to accelerate the revolutionization of sports teams, leading cadres of sports departments at all levels must first consciously take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well, and at the same time regard leading the study of Chairman Mao's works as the primary task. It is necessary to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, engaging in revolution for a lifetime, studying Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, and making great efforts in "application" for a lifetime. It is necessary to take class struggle as the key link, carry out the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in sports teams, and establish the idea of serving the revolution wholeheartedly; it is necessary to learn from the People's Liberation Army, use politics to command professional work and technology; it is necessary to view achievements and shortcomings dialectically, guard against arrogance, and continuously make revolution. Oppose the erroneous ideas of belittling politics and valuing professional work, equating politics and technology, as well as bourgeois individualism, championism, complacency, and stagnation. At any time and in any work, politics must be put first.
    The conference emphasized that sports work, whether in popularization or improvement, must follow its own path, that is, the path of giving prominence to politics. It is necessary to study and explore the laws of sports work with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, correctly handle various relationships, such as the relationship between politics and technology, popularization and improvement, the overall situation and the local situation, key points and generalities, learning and creating, success and failure, etc., to promote sports work to better serve socialist revolution and construction.
    When summarizing the sports work in 1965, the conference believed that this year, sports work showed a brand-new situation in both popularization and improvement, and it was a year of great strides forward. Many activists in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way emerged in sports teams, which promoted the rapid development of the sports cause. China's table tennis team and Comrade Xu Yinsheng, etc., are the pacesetters in the sports front in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. They armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, transformed their subjective world, and paid attention to using dialectical viewpoints to guide training and competitions, thereby achieving major victories. Under the guidance of the idea of "exercising for the revolution," the broad masses of people enthusiastically and consciously participated in various sports exercises, so that unprecedentedly active scenes appeared in swimming, shooting, mountaineering, communications, long-distance running, military camping, and other sports activities with high practical value, and the number of people participating in exercise was unprecedentedly large. A series of practices have proved that giving prominence to politics is the fundamental reason why sports work achieved great results in 1965.
    When discussing the tasks of sports work in 1966, the conference pointed out that it is necessary to continue to resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique" and that sports should "serve labor production and national defense construction," actively adopt various measures to strengthen mass sports work, especially to vigorously strengthen mass national defense sports work. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's idea of people's war, greatly promote exercising for the revolution, so that the broad masses of people can enhance their national defense concepts through sports, especially national defense sports, master some military knowledge and military skills, as well as some skills that can be used for production, life, and national defense, and exercise and cultivate a strong physique that can endure great hardships and hard work. It is necessary to take sports as an important means of carrying out communist education to the people, focusing on the sports work of young people, especially the sports work of schools, so that they can develop in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education.
    The conference also required the broad masses of athletes to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "playing ball for the revolution" and "having the motherland in mind and the world in sight," adhere to the principle of starting from the needs of actual combat, conducting large-volume training from difficulty and strictness, achieving the five hardnesses of not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of difficulty, not being afraid of fatigue, and ideology, body, technology, training, and competition; establish their own unique style, carry out activities of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, and continuously improve the level of sports technology and climb world peaks.
    The conference also emphasized that carrying out sports work must rely on the leadership of party committees at all levels, rely on the masses, and closely cooperate with various relevant departments. Sports departments at all levels must vigorously promote the style of going deep into reality and going deep into the masses to conduct investigation and research, continuously sum up experience, establish advanced models, and promote the entire sports work; it is necessary to earnestly implement the spirit of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, practice economy, work hard, and oppose extravagance and waste.
    The conference, held in February, also discussed issues such as the Third Five-Year Development Plan for the sports cause and adopted the "Decision on Launching a New Upsurge of Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works in a Living Way on the Sports Front."

    体育战线决定掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮
    坚持政治挂帅加速体育队伍革命化
    贺龙副总理向全国体育工作会议指出：学习毛主席著作要自觉，要经常，要联系实际，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    新华社四日讯　最近在北京召开的一九六六年全国体育工作会议，号召全国体育工作者和运动员坚定不移地突出政治，把毛主席著作当作体育工作的最高指示，把活学活用毛主席著作作为一切体育工作中最迫切、最重要、最根本的任务，掀起一个更广泛、更深入、更有成效的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    贺龙副总理对会议作了重要指示。他指出，林彪同志提出的突出政治的五项原则，完全适合于体育队伍，体育队伍从上到下都要认真学习，切实执行。他要求体育队伍必须继续强调大学解放军，特别要学解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，大抓四个第一、“三八”作风和“四好”、“五好”等方面的经验。
    关于在体育队伍中如何突出政治，学好用好毛主席著作的问题，贺龙副总理再次强调，学习毛主席著作要自觉，要经常，要联系实际，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，首先是改造世界观。人的思想改造好了，有了正确的世界观，才能掌握正确的思想方法，培养出良好的工作作风，其他问题都可以迎刃而解。离开了政治，离开了毛泽东思想，便迷失了方向，就会犯错误。国家体委和各级体委今后无论布置工作、总结工作和举行会议，都要政治挂帅、思想领先，要检查活学活用毛主席著作做得怎么样。
    会议按照贺龙副总理的指示，以整风的精神，展开批评和自我批评，交流和总结了经验，肯定了我国体育事业在一九六五年取得的成绩。同时，会议认为，体育战线在学习毛主席著作方面，同其他先进单位比较，还有差距。因此，要求体育工作者和运动员要象解放军、大庆人、大寨人那样，以鲜明的阶级立场、阶级感情，带着问题学习毛主席著作。学的目的全部在于用。要用以改造体育队伍的思想，使体育队伍成为一支又红又专的革命队伍，用思想革命化带动体育工作革命化。
    到会代表一致认为，要加速体育队伍的革命化，各级体育部门的领导干部首先要自觉地带头学好用好毛主席著作，同时也要把领导学习毛主席著作当作首要任务。要象焦裕禄同志那样，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下一辈子功夫。要以阶级斗争为纲，在体育队伍中开展兴无灭资的斗争，树立一心为革命的思想；要大学解放军，以政治统帅业务、统帅技术；要一分为二地看待成绩和缺点，力戒骄傲，不断革命。反对轻政治、重业务，政治和技术平列，以及资产阶级个人主义、锦标主义、骄傲自满、故步自封等错误思想。在任何时候，做任何工作，都要把政治放在第一位。
    会议强调指出，体育工作无论在普及或提高方面，都必须走自己的路，也就是走突出政治的路。必须以辩证唯物论的观点研究、探索体育工作的规律，正确处理各种关系，如政治和技术、普及和提高、全局和局部、重点和一般、学习和创造、胜和负的关系等等，促使体育工作更好地为社会主义革命和建设服务。
    会议在总结一九六五年的体育工作时认为，这一年体育工作在普及和提高方面，都出现了崭新的局面，是大踏步前进的一年。体育队伍中涌现出不少活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，推动了体育事业的迅速发展。我国乒乓球队和徐寅生同志等，就是体育战线上活学活用毛泽东思想的标兵。他们用毛泽东思想武装自己，改造自己的主观世界，并且注意运用辩证观点指导训练和比赛，从而取得了重大胜利。全国广大群众在“为革命而锻炼”的思想指导下，踊跃地自觉地参加了各种体育锻炼，因而在游泳、射击、登山、通讯、长跑、军事野营等实用价值很高的体育活动中，出现了前所未有的活跃景象，参加锻炼的人空前的多。一系列的实践都证明，一九六五年体育工作所以取得很大成绩，突出政治是根本原因。
    会议在讨论一九六六年体育工作的任务时指出，必须继续坚决贯彻党中央和毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”和体育运动“为劳动生产和国防建设服务”的指示，积极采取各项措施，加强群众体育工作，特别要大力加强群众性的国防体育工作。要在毛主席人民战争的思想指导下，大大提倡为革命而锻炼，使广大群众通过体育运动，特别是国防体育运动，增强国防观念，掌握一些军事知识和军事技术，以及一些既能用于生产、生活，又能为国防服务的技能，锻炼和培养能够吃大苦、耐大劳的坚强体魄。要把体育运动作为向人民群众进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一，重点抓好青少年的体育工作，首先是学校的体育工作，使他们在德育智育体育几方面都得到发展。
    会议还要求广大运动员继续发扬“为革命而打球”、“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的革命精神，坚持从实战需要出发，从难、从严进行大运动量训练的原则，做到不怕苦、不怕难、不怕累和思想、身体、技术、训练、比赛五过硬；树立自己的独特风格，开展比学赶帮超活动，不断提高运动技术水平，攀登世界高峰。
    会议还强调，开展体育工作必须依靠各级党委的领导，依靠群众，同各有关部门密切协作。各级体育部门都要大力提倡深入实际、深入群众进行调查研究的作风，不断总结经验，树立先进典型，推动整个体育工作；要切实贯彻勤俭办事业的精神，厉行节约，艰苦奋斗，反对铺张浪费。
    在二月间举行的这次会议，还讨论了关于体育事业第三个五年发展规划等方面的问题，通过了“在体育战线上掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的决定”。
