    What Comes First?
    Ma Guozheng
    The short story "The Fiftieth Hurdle" (contained in "Selections of New Writers and Works," Volume 1) depicts the story of a "Tiger Mountain Hero Company" with glorious traditions in the process of diligently practicing superb skills. Company Commander Miao Donghua only emphasized proficiency in military techniques, neglecting political command and ideological work, thus fostering the purely military viewpoint, championship-seeking mentality, and complacency of Second Squad Leader Zhou Dashan. Faced with this situation, the newly transferred company political instructor—the company commander's old comrade-in-arms, Zhang Youfa—keenly sensed the lack of political awareness. He adhered to principles, insisted on highlighting politics, and engaged in a serious yet patient struggle against the company commander's and others' tendency to disregard politics. There is a very vivid dialogue between the instructor and the company commander:
    "Old Miao, what do you say is the most important thing in our creation of 'Four Goods'?"
    "That goes without saying, political ideology comes first!"
    "Right! Then what comes first for us?"
    "What do you say comes first for us?" The company commander paused slightly.
    "Old Miao, we are old comrades, let's have a heart-to-heart today..." "It seems to me that our company is first in grenade throwing and first in the red flag."
    The crux of the matter lies here: it's not politics first, but grenade throwing first, red flag first. Precisely because politics is not in command, from the company commander and the second squad leader to the soldiers of the second squad, complacency has grown. They are self-satisfied in the face of honor, unable to withstand praise, and even specially made envelopes printed with the words "Tiger Mountain Hero Company" to distribute to soldiers to widely write letters to "spread the good news" and "promote our company's fame." Everyone has shed their spiritual armor and is reveling in a chorus of praise. Precisely because politics is not in command, everyone's mind is filled with "breaking the 50-meter barrier in grenade throwing," practicing martial arts purely to compete for honors, and some bizarre arguments have emerged: "Military technology is hard, and hard work requires hard methods to cultivate." "Meetings are for sitting on your butt, they are soft methods and cannot cultivate hard skills." Therefore, they do not talk about ideology, do not discuss contradictions, and plunge headlong into military technology. Precisely because politics is not in command, phenomena of not observing discipline have emerged, and they no longer implement combat readiness measures in dormitory life. In a word: a series of chain reactions have occurred.
    What exactly comes first? Is it politics or professional work! This is not completely resolved in people's practice. Some people are like this company commander, verbally admitting that political ideology comes first, but in action, it is still technology first. Some people simply do not understand the power of the spiritual atom bomb. They are puzzled and always believe that political ideology is empty, invisible, and intangible, while technology is hard and immediate. Fighting requires technology, running a factory requires technology, and playing ball also requires technology.... Little do they know that only when politics is in command can professional skills have a clear political direction, can professional skills be commanded well, and can the purpose of studying professional skills be clarified; only then can we "move one hair and affect the whole body," exert the greatest subjective initiative to improve professional skills; only then can we make the greatest effort to overcome difficulties and climb peaks; only then can we eliminate all kinds of distracting thoughts and devote ourselves wholeheartedly to professional activities and make outstanding achievements for the people.
    The question of what to put first is not a matter of method, but a matter of direction and principle. We must not take it lightly.

    什么第一？
    马国征
    短篇小说《五十大关》（载《新人新作选》第一集），描写了一个有光荣传统的“虎山英雄连”在苦练过硬本领过程中发生的故事。连长缪东化只强调军事技术过得硬，忽视政治挂帅，不注意抓活思想，助长了二班长周大山的单纯军事观点、锦标主义思想和骄傲自满情绪。面对这种情况，新调来的连指导员——连长的老战友章有法，敏锐地嗅到了不问政治的气味，他坚持原则，坚持突出政治，同连长等人的不问政治倾向进行了既严肃又耐心的斗争。这里有一段指导员跟连长的对话很生动：
    “老缪，你说咱们创四好当中什么是第一位的东西？”
    “那还用说，政治思想第一嘛！”
    “对！那我们是什么第一？”
    “你说我们是什么第一？”连长略顿了一下。
    “老缪，咱们是老战友，今天谈谈心，……”“我看，咱连好象是投弹第一、红旗第一。”
    症结就在这里：不是政治第一，而是投弹第一，红旗第一。正由于政治不挂帅，从连长、二班班长到二班战士，滋长了自满情绪，在荣誉面前沾沾自喜，经不起夸，甚至特制了印有“虎山英雄连”字样的信封，发给战士广泛写信“报喜”，“给咱们连扬扬名”，大家解除了精神武装，陶醉在一片颂声中了。正由于政治不挂帅，大家满脑子就是“投弹突破五十米大关”，单纯为争荣誉而练武，一些离奇的论调也出现了：“军事技术是硬的，硬功夫要硬方法才能培养出来。”“开会是坐屁股，是软方法，培养不出硬功夫。”因而不谈思想，不摆矛盾，一头钻到军事技术里去了。正由于政治不挂帅，不遵守纪律的现象露头了，宿舍生活中也不执行备战措施了。一句话：产生了一系列连锁反应。
    究竟什么第一？是政治，还是业务！在人们的实践中并不是完全解决了的。有些人就象这个连长那样，口头上承认政治思想第一，可行动上还是技术第一：有些人就是不懂得精神原子弹的威力，他们疑惑不解，总认为政治思想是空的，看不到摸不着，而技术则是硬的、现的：打仗要靠技术，办工厂要靠技术，打球也要靠技术……。殊不知，只有政治挂了帅，业务技术才能有明确的政治方向，才能把业务技术统帅好，才能明确钻研业务技术的目的是什么：才能“牵一发而动全身”，发挥最大的主观能动性去提高业务技术水平；才能以最大的努力去克服困难，攀登高峰；才能排除各种杂念，全身心地投入业务活动中去，为人民作出出色的成绩来。
    究竟把什么放在第一位的问题，不是一个方法问题，而是一个方向问题，原则问题。我们千万不可等闲视之。
