    In 1964, November, at Datong Weir in Ningbo, Zhejiang, a simple inclined ship lift was completed. When the electric winch was started, wooden boats, fully loaded with agricultural by-products, daily necessities, and agricultural fertilizers, sat steadily on the “bamboo bed” of the small car, crossing the dam along the inclined rails. The ship’s body was stable, and it only took two minutes to cross the dam. Since then, Datong Weir ended its history of using manual labor to drag boats over the dam for more than a hundred years, realizing the mechanization of boats crossing the dam.
    This simple ship lift was successfully built by the technical personnel of our institute in cooperation with local workers. We conducted the design of simple ship lifts in two locations in Zhejiang, and Datong Weir was one of them. The designs of these two ship lifts were basically similar in scale and had similar conditions. However, the design work in these two places formed a sharp contrast between being more, faster, better, and more economical versus being less, slower, worse, and more expensive.
    Two young technicians came to Datong Weir to do the design. As soon as they arrived at the dam, they lived and worked together with the workers. At the construction site, they not only saw but also personally felt how urgent the people's demands for building ship lifts were. Datong Weir is a weir dam leading to the Zhongtang River. It is an important transportation hub, and materials from the vast area nearby must be transported out through here. However, boats crossing Datong Weir had to be pulled by manpower. A ten-ton wooden boat required more than twenty strong laborers to push the winch and drag the boat over the dam, which was very strenuous work.
    At the construction site, the old workers also told them about their miserable experiences in the old society. Before liberation, Datong Weir was occupied by feudal overseers. The dam workers toiled year-round but could not get enough to eat. After reaching middle age, losing their labor power, they were kicked away by the overseers and left to wander the streets. All of this deeply aroused the class feelings of the two young people, and they secretly made up their minds: they must help them improve their working conditions. Originally, they felt that designing a simple small ship lift was not much of a "promising endeavor," but now they felt that it was a worthwhile undertaking.
    What kind of ship lift should be designed? They had no experience. According to foreign books, it was suitable to build ship lifts with a head of water of more than 30 meters, while Datong Weir only had a low head of water of two meters. According to the rules in the books, only ship locks could be built. Building ship locks would be a large project, with high cost and complex technology, so it was obviously not feasible. Should they simply copy the foreign models, or should they proceed from reality and take their own path? They decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and go to the masses to find a solution. Upon investigation, they learned that the workers at Sanba in Hangzhou had already created a simple dam-crossing machine, which was to lay broken tires on a simple small car and pull the boat over the dam on top. The workers at Datong Weir also wanted to adopt this method because it was simple and easy to implement and cost very little. But this native ship lift also had shortcomings. For example, when the boat crossed the dam, the boat’s body was tilted, and liquid fertilizer could not be fully loaded across the dam.
    These two young people absorbed the advantages of this good creation by the masses and made a fundamental transformation to it, proposing a new design plan. The new plan was to change the past earth slide into a small iron rail and use a double-layered hook flatcar. The car used a flexible “bed” made of bamboo shoots, so that the boat was placed on the “bed” stably and without tilting. An electric winch was used to replace manpower, and indicator lights on the operating console were used to control the winch. After such a transformation, the original imperfect native method became a simple ship lift combining both native and foreign methods.
    Eight scientific and technical personnel, including several engineers, participated in the design of the simple ship lift in another place in Zhejiang. Their approach was different from that of the two young technicians at Datong Weir. After arriving at their destination, they did not seriously go to the masses to conduct on-the-spot investigations. Instead, they took a cursory look at the site twice, collected some data, and then quickly returned to the research institute and squatted in the building to do the design. When problems were encountered in the work, they did not go to the site to investigate but instead sought guidance from books. They did not understand that many of China's small and medium-sized rivers had not yet prepared a complete set of original data for design work; even if there was, it was not the most reliable primary data. As a result, a lot of time was spent, but what was obtained was some impractical clause.
    After more than three months, they designed several plans separately. Which plan was more correct and in line with reality? They did not ask the workers and masses for advice but shut themselves up and compared them themselves. Some comrades used the advantages of their own plans to compare the disadvantages of other people's plans, and they argued endlessly. After spending a lot of time, they selected a plan copied from a foreign book, believing that it had been "tested" abroad and was safe and reliable. But when it was brought to the site, the masses did not approve it. The workers pointed out that it had three major shortcomings: First, it occupied too much land, occupying about nine mu of farmland near the weir; second, the cost was too high; third, the time for boats to cross the dam was too long, taking about twenty-two minutes per cycle. This plan was rejected. Later, they spent more than two months remedying the shortcomings of the original plan, but because the investment was high, the masses still did not approve it. At this time, the Datong Weir simple ship lift, which started later than them, had already been completed. It did not occupy farmland, saved investment, and the time to cross the dam was fast. They had to redesign it.
    The sharp contrast in the designs of these two ship lifts gave the research and design personnel of our institute a profound education. It tells us that to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical in technical work, we must put Mao Zedong Thought in command and politics in command. If we depart from this point, we will inevitably go down the road of being less, slower, worse, and more expensive.

### 我们在浙江两个地方设计简易升船机，两处任务相同，条件也基本相同，结果一个是多快好省，一个是少慢差费。它们说明了什么问题呢？  设计工作绝对不能脱离群众

    我们在浙江两个地方设计简易升船机，两处任务相同，条件也基本相同，结果一个是多快好省，一个是少慢差费。它们说明了什么问题呢？
    设计工作绝对不能脱离群众
    一九六四年十一月，在浙江宁波大通堰，一台简易的斜面升船机建成了。开动电动绞车，一只只满载衣副产品、日用百货和农用肥料的木船，安安稳稳地坐在小车的“竹床”上，沿着倾斜的轨道翻过坝去，船身平稳，只要两分钟就过了坝。从此，大通堰结束了一百多年来用人力拖船过坝的历史，实现了船只过坝机械化。
    这台简易升船机，是我所的技术人员和当地的工人合作搞成功的。我们在浙江两处地方进行了简易升船机的设计，大通堰就是其中之一。这两处升船机的设计，规模基本相似，条件也差不多。但是这两处的设计工作，却形成了多快好省与少慢差费的尖锐对比。
    到大通堰作设计的是两位青年技术员，他们一到坝上就和工人们生活在一起，劳动在一起。在工地上，他们不仅看到，而且亲身感受到了人们对修建升船机的要求是那么迫切。大通堰是通向中塘河的一道堰坝，这是一个重要的交通枢纽，附近广大地区的物资，都要经过这里运输出去。但是船只过大通堰却要用人力牵引，一只十吨的木船，得用二十多个壮劳动力，推动绞车，将船拖过坝去，工作十分劳累。
    在工地上，老工人们还给他们讲述旧社会的悲惨遭遇。解放前，大通堰为封建把头所占有，车坝工人终年辛苦，得不到一饱，过了壮年，丧失了劳力，就被把头一脚踢开，流落街头。所有这些，深深激发了两个青年人的阶级感情，他们暗暗下了决心：一定要帮助他们改善劳动条件。原先，他们还觉得设计简易小升船机没有多大“奔头”，而现在觉得是大有搞头了。
    设计什么样的升船机呢？他们没有经验，根据外国书本上的记载，修建升船机要有三十米以上高的水头才适宜，而大通堰只有两米的低水头，按书本规定，只能修建船闸。修船闸的工程大，造价高，技术复杂，显然没有条件。是照搬洋框框呢，还是从实际出发走自己的路？他们决定按照毛主席的教导，走到群众中去找办法。一调查，才知道杭州三坝的工人们早已创造了一种简易过坝机械，它就是在一台简单的小车上，铺上破轮胎，把船放在上边拉过坝去。大通堰的工人们也想采用这个办法，因为它简单易行，花钱很少。但这个土升船机也有缺点，例如船过坝时，船身是倾斜的，液体肥料就不能满装过坝。
    这两个青年人就吸取了群众这个好创造的优点，并把它作了根本的改造，提出了一个新的设计方案。新方案是把过去的土滑道改为小铁轨，采用了一个双层挂钩平车，车上用竹梢做一个有弹性的“床”，船放在“床”上既平稳而又不致倾斜，并且用电动绞车来代替人力，由操作台上的指示灯来指挥。经过这样一改造，原来不完善的土办法就变成了一台土洋结合的简易升船机。
    到浙江另一地方参加设计简易升船机的有八个科学技术人员，其中还有几名工程师。他们和大通堰两个青年技术员的做法不一样。到达目的地以后，他们没有认真走到群众中去作实地调查，而是在现场上走马看花的转了两次，搜集了一些资料以后，他们就很快回到研究所，蹲在大楼里作设计。工作中遇到了问题，不是到现场去调查，而是向书本去求教。他们不了解，我国的许多中小型河流还没有为设计工作准备出一套完整的原始资料；即使有，也不是最可靠的第一性资料。结果花了不少时间，得到的却是一些脱离实际的条文。
    经过了三个多月，他们分头设计出了几个方案。哪一个方案比较正确和符合实际呢？他们不是去向工人群众请教，而是关起门来自己进行比较，有些同志以自己方案之长，来对比他人方案之短，争论不休。费了好多时间，才选定了一个从外国书上搬来的方案，认为这是在国外经过“考验”的，稳妥可靠。可是它一拿到现场上，群众却通不过。工人们指出它有三大缺点：一、占地太多，要占堰坝附近耕地达九亩左右；二、造价太高；三、船只过坝时间太长，每循环一次约需二十二分钟。这个方案就被否定了。以后，他们又花了两个多月时间，对原方案的缺点作了一些补救，由于投资高，群众还是通不过。就在这个时候，动手比他们晚的大通堰简易升船机已经竣工了，它不占农田，投资省，过坝时间又快。他们不得不重新设计。
    这两处升船机设计的鲜明对比，使我所研究设计人员受了一次深刻的教育，它告诉我们，技术工作要达到多快好省，必须毛泽东思想挂帅，政治挂帅，离开了这一点，就必然走到少慢差费的路上去。
