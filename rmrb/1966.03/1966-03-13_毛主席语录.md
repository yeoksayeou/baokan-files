    Mao Zedong Quotations
    "Take your two feet, go to all parts and places within your work area, learn from Confucius's 'ask about everything,' and even if your talent is small, you can solve problems, because when you haven't gone out, your brain is empty, and when you return, your brain is no longer empty, it has brought back all the necessary materials to solve the problem, and the problem is solved in this way."
                            《反对本本主义》[Against Book Worship]

    毛主席语录
    “迈开你的两脚，到你的工作范围的各部分各地方去走走，学个孔夫子的‘每事问’，任凭什么才力小也能解决问题，因为你未出门时脑子是空的，归来时脑子已经不是空的了，已经载来了解决问题的各种必要材料，问题就是这样子解决了。”
