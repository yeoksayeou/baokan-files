    De Gaulle's New Challenge
    Recently, French President De Gaulle wrote to US President Johnson, requesting that the US turn over the bases, facilities, and 30,000 troops maintained in France under the name of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" to French control. This event has caused a great shock in the Western world. The Associated Press said that France's action "struck the heart of the alliance." The French newspaper *Combat* also said that this was De Gaulle giving the North Atlantic Group "a hoeing."
    The North Atlantic Group is a tool used by the United States to control Western European countries. With the restoration and strengthening of the economic and military strength of Western European countries and the relative decline of US strength, Western European countries will inevitably strive to break free from US control. Among these countries, France has been the most active. Recently, France has focused its struggle against the US on the issue of reorganizing the North Atlantic Group.
    France's demand to change the status quo of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" began in 1958. In order to prevent the United States from controlling the organization single-handedly, De Gaulle requested the establishment of a leadership core of the United States, Britain, and France within the North Atlantic Group. France's request was, of course, not agreed to by Washington. After the US flatly refused, De Gaulle began a series of actions to resist the North Atlantic Group. From 1959 to 1960, France successively withdrew its Mediterranean fleet from the North Atlantic Group, forced more than two hundred American aircraft carrying nuclear weapons to leave French airports, and firmly prohibited the United States from setting up intermediate-range missiles within French territory. However, despite this, the slogan put forward by France at that time was only to "reform and strengthen" the North Atlantic Group and to make France "enjoy its status" in the group.
    After the Kennedy government came to power in 1961, it began to tighten its control over Western Europe, further promoting the plan to require Western European countries to only develop conventional weapons and rely on the United States for nuclear weapons, while striving to suppress France's development of its own nuclear weapons. The De Gaulle government then put forward a tough stance against the North Atlantic Group, in fact, the US military "integration" plan, insisting that this plan must be changed. However, France still left room at that time and did not decisively propose a "complete reorganization" of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
    With the "Nassau Agreement" of 1963, in which the US and Britain attempted to strike at France on the issue of nuclear weapons, De Gaulle's opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization became even more intense. At the end of 1964, after the US's plan to isolate France with the "multilateral nuclear force" declared failure, De Gaulle finally proposed for the first time in his New Year's Eve speech to reporters that "the current organizational form of the North Atlantic Group is not meant to be maintained permanently."
    The news that France would completely reorganize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and might withdraw from the organization when the treaty expired in April 1969, amid the further deterioration of Franco-American relations in the first half of 1965, spread like wildfire throughout the Western world. De Gaulle's speech at a press conference on September 9 and the specific plan for reorganizing the North Atlantic Group and excluding the United States, published in the authoritative French magazine *Foreign Policy* quarterly on October 15, finally confirmed these rumors.
    France's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group and its firm refusal to allow the United States to use French territory for strategic deployments is a huge blow to US control over Western Europe. *The Washington Star* admitted last August that without France's participation, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would be "crippled." Therefore, although responsible officials of the US State Department have repeatedly asserted that "even if France withdraws from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, other member states will still be able to operate an effective military system," US Secretary of Defense McNamara was forced to state last month that the United States was prepared to "seriously and politely consider any suggestions that France or any other ally might make."
    However, the Johnson administration's combination of soft and hard tactics cannot change France's determination to break free from US control. After the De Gaulle government's request for bilateral talks with the United States was rejected, it has stated that it will unilaterally take the measures it deems necessary to restore French sovereignty. The American ruling group will certainly try to counterattack. But when its weakness in its inability to do so is increasingly exposed to its Western European "allies," it will be difficult for the United States to maintain its hegemony over Western Europe.

    戴高乐的新挑战
    最近，法国总统戴高乐写信给美国总统约翰逊，要求把美国在“北大西洋公约组织”名义下在法国保有的基地、设施和三万驻军交归法国控制。这件事在西方世界引起了很大震动。美联社说，法国这一行动“击中了联盟的心脏”。法国《战斗报》也说，这是戴高乐给北大西洋集团的“一锄头”。
    北大西洋集团是美国用来控制西欧国家的一个工具。随着西欧国家经济和军事实力的恢复和加强以及美国实力的相对下降，西欧国家就必然力求摆脱美国控制。在这当中，法国表现得最为积极。最近，法国已把抗美斗争的重心放到改组北大西洋集团的问题上。
    法国要求改变“北大西洋公约组织”的现状是从一九五八年开始的。为了不让美国一手控制这个组织，戴高乐曾要求在北大西洋集团中建立以美、英、法三国为核心的领导。法国的要求，当然不会为华盛顿所同意。在美国断然拒绝后，戴高乐就开始了一系列抵制北大西洋集团的行动。从一九五九年到一九六○年，法国先后从北大西洋集团撤回了它的地中海舰队，迫使美国两百多架载有核武器的飞机离开法国机场，同时，坚决禁止美国在法国境内设置中程导弹。但是，尽管这样，法国当时提出的口号还只是“改革和加强”北大西洋集团和使法国在集团中“享有它的身份”。
    肯尼迪政府一九六一年上台后，开始加紧控制西欧，进一步推行要西欧国家只发展常规武器，而在核武器上依靠美国的计划，同时竭力压制法国发展自己的核武器。戴高乐政府于是针对北大西洋集团，其实也就是美国的军事“一体化”计划，提出了必须改变这个计划的强硬主张。但是，法国当时仍然留有余地，没有断然提出“彻底改组”“北大西洋公约组织”的建议。
    随着一九六三年美英通过“拿骚协议”，力图在核武器问题上打击法国，戴高乐反对北大西洋公约组织的态度就更趋激烈。一九六四年底，在美国孤立法国的“多边核力量”计划宣告失败后，戴高乐在除夕对记者讲话中终于第一次提出了北大西洋集团“目前的组织形式不是规定要长久维持下去”的主张。
    法国要彻底改组北大西洋公约组织，并在一九六九年四月公约期满时可能退出这个组织的消息，在一九六五年上半年法美关系更趋恶化声中，曾经沸沸扬扬，传遍西方世界。九月九日，戴高乐在记者招待会上的讲话，十月十五日法国权威性杂志《外交政策》季刊所刊登的改组北大西洋集团、排除美国的具体方案，终于证实了这些传说。
    法国要退出北大西洋集团和坚决不允许美国利用法国领土进行战略部署，是对美国控制西欧的巨大的打击。《华盛顿明星晚报》去年八月就承认，没有法国参加，北大西洋公约组织就会是“断肢缺腿”的。因此，尽管美国国务院的负责官员一再扬言，“即使法国退出北大西洋公约组织，其他成员国仍然能够运用一个有效的军事体系”，但是美国国防部长麦克纳马拉上月不得不表示，美国准备“认真而有礼貌地考虑法国或任何其他盟国要提出的任何建议”。
    但是约翰逊政府的软硬兼施，并不能改变法国摆脱美国控制的决心。戴高乐政府要求同美国进行双边会谈，遭到对方拒绝后，已表示将单方面采取它认为必要的措施来恢复法国的主权。美国统治集团当然要力图进行反扑。但是当它力不从心的弱点，越来越暴露于它的西欧“盟国”面前的时候，美国要想保持它对西欧的霸权是很难办得到的。（史元）
