    The "Kokoku Chemical Industries" company, located in Okyomachi, Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, is a monopolistic enterprise that accepts "special procurement" military orders for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam. It made a fortune manufacturing jungle boots for the U.S. military in the Vietnam War.

    The jungle boots used by the United States in its war of aggression against Vietnam have consistently been produced by large Japanese chemical companies. These transactions are all cash transactions, which has made the large Japanese monopoly enterprises extremely envious. With the intensification of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, orders for jungle boots have increased year by year, and the transaction volume has increased from $100,000 before 1960 to $2,074,000 (approximately 750 million Japanese yen) in 1964.

      "Kokoku Chemical Industries" company has been particularly active in accepting "special procurement" orders for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, taking the lead among other chemical companies. It produces more than 200,000 pairs of jungle boots for the U.S. military in Vietnam each year, with sales exceeding 100 million Japanese yen. Because it made a large fortune in this "special procurement" order and became a nouveau riche, it built a luxurious six-story office building, and the original head office building has been converted into a warehouse. Because of this, people have denounced this Japanese monopoly enterprise, which made a killing in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, as a "merchant of death."

    东京的“死亡贩子”
    座落在东京都新宿区大京町的“兴国化学工业”公司，是一家接受美帝国主义侵越战争“特需”军事订货的垄断企业。它是替侵越美军生产丛林靴而发了财的。
    美国在侵越战争中使用的丛林靴，一直是由日本的大化工企业生产。这种交易全是现钱交易，因而使日本大垄断企业十分眼红。随着美国侵越战争的加剧，丛林靴的订货与年俱增，交易额也从一九六○年以前的十万美元，增加到一九六四年的二百零七万四千美元（约合七亿五千万日元）。
      “兴国化学工业”公司接受美国侵越战争的“特需”订货特别积极，走在其它化工企业的前头。它替侵越美军生产的丛林靴，每年多达二十万双以上，销售额在一亿日元以上。由于它在这项“特需”订货中发了大财，变成了暴发户，新修了一所豪华的六层办公大楼，原来的总社办事处的房子已改做了仓库。因为这样，人们把这家在美国侵越战争中捞了一把的日本垄断企业斥之为“死亡贩子”。
