    United as One
    He Jiang
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Since the emergence of this monster of imperialism, world affairs have been linked together. It is impossible to sever them."
    Imperialism not only exploits and oppresses its own people but also greedily plunders and enslaves other nations. Thus, the cause of liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, and the struggles of the people of all countries in the world, are linked together as a whole.
    Today, U.S. imperialism is the biggest monster among the imperialist monsters. Its frantic aggression in various parts of the world has united the people of all countries on an unprecedented scale, supporting each other and forming the broadest international united front against the U.S.
    When one side has problems, all sides provide assistance. This is a kind of mutual support. Wherever the people rise up to resist U.S. imperialism, the people of the whole world will support the struggle there. Wherever U.S. imperialism interferes with or suppresses a revolutionary struggle, the people of the whole world will rise up to denounce U.S. imperialism. In this way, the struggles of the people of the whole world are closely linked together.
    You oppose the U.S. there, and I oppose the U.S. here. This is also a kind of mutual support. Today, in the major continents and oceans of the world, from the highlands of South Vietnam to the jungles of Congo (Leopoldville), from the coasts of Japan to the streets of Santo Domingo, from the foothills of the Andes to the banks of the Mekong River, anti-U.S. storms are rising everywhere. Although these places are tens of thousands of miles apart and separated by vast oceans, they encourage and echo each other in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.
    The people of the world rise up to oppose U.S. imperialism, and the American people rise up to oppose their own country's imperialism. This is another kind of mutual support. The struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism supports the American people; the struggle waged by the American people at home, in turn, supports the people of all countries.
    In short, in today's world, no matter what region, what country, what nation, as long as they rise up to oppose U.S. imperialism, they will inevitably converge with the struggles of the people of all countries. The more the people of each country contain the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism in their own struggle, the harsher the blows they inflict on U.S. imperialism, the greater their support for the people of other countries. The heroic Vietnamese people have trapped more than 200,000 U.S. troops on the battlefield in South Vietnam, unable to extricate themselves, and have given them a severe blow. This not only greatly encourages the people of the world but also is a great aid to the people of all countries.
    U.S. imperialism always tries its best to divide the people of the world in order to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one. An attack on any country or region is an attack on the people of the whole world. Only by uniting and supporting each other can the people of the world smash the schemes and tricks of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, in the eyes of the people of all countries, supporting others is supporting themselves.
    Birds of a feather flock together, and people are divided into groups. The people of the world are united as one in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are united as one in counter-revolutionary activities. The Khrushchev revisionists shout "unity" with their mouths, but in fact, they are precisely colluding with U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries, undermining the anti-imperialist unity of the people of all countries, and undermining the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the people of the whole world. They are unadulterated accomplices of U.S. imperialism.
    However, neither U.S. imperialism nor any of its accomplices can change the dialectical laws of historical development. The result of U.S. imperialism carrying out aggression around the world can only be to unite the struggles of the people of all countries, and to isolate itself. U.S. imperialism cannot divide the people of the world, but is destined to divide itself. The great unity of the people of the world is the great division of U.S. imperialism. The people of the world, united and fighting heroically, will surely wipe out this great monster of U.S. imperialism and all the demons and monsters step by step.

    联成一气
    何江
    毛泽东同志说过：“自从帝国主义这个怪物出世之后，世界的事情就联成一气了，要想割开也不可能了。”
    帝国主义不仅剥削和压迫本国人民，并且贪得无厌地掠夺和奴役其他民族。这样，一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放事业，世界各国人民的斗争，就联系起来成为一个整体。
    今天的美帝国主义，是帝国主义怪物中的最大怪物。它在世界各地的疯狂侵略，使得世界各国人民在史无前例的规模上联成一气，互相支持，结成最广泛的国际反美统一战线。
    一方有事，八方援助。这是一种互相支持。无论哪个地方的人民起来反抗美帝国主义，全世界人民就去支持那里的斗争。无论美帝国主义去干涉或镇压哪一个地方的革命斗争，全世界人民就一齐起来声讨美帝国主义。这样，全世界人民的斗争就密切地联结在一起了。
    你在你那里反美，我在我这里反美。这也是一种互相支持。今天，在世界的各大洲、各大洋，从南越的高原到刚果（利）的丛林，从日本的海滨到圣多明各的街头，从安第斯山麓到湄公河畔，到处兴起反美风暴。这些地方尽管相距万里远隔重洋，但是在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，都是互相鼓舞，互相呼应的。
    世界各国人民起来反对美帝国主义，美国人民起来反对本国帝国主义。这又是一种互相支持。世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，支持了美国人民；美国人民在国内所进行的斗争，又支持了世界各国人民。
    总之，在今天的世界上，不管那个地区，那个国家，那个民族，只要起来反对美帝国主义，那就必然同世界各国人民的斗争汇合在一起。各国人民在自己的斗争中牵制美帝国主义的侵略力量越多，给予美帝国主义的打击越狠，他们对于其他国家人民的支援作用也就越大。英勇的越南人民，使美帝国主义的二十多万大军陷在南越战场上不能自拔，并且给了它以狠狠的打击。这不仅大大鼓舞了全世界人民，而且是对各国人民的巨大援助。
    美帝国主义总是千方百计地企图把世界人民分割开来，以达到各个击破的目的。它对任何一个国家、一个地区的进攻，也就是对全世界人民的进攻。全世界人民只有联合起来，互相支持，才能粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋诡计。因此，在各国人民看来，支援了别人，也就是支援了自己。
    物以类聚，人以群分。全世界人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中联成一气。美帝国主义及其走狗们则在反革命活动中联成一气。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者口里高喊“联合”，其实他们恰恰是同美帝国主义和反动派互相勾结，破坏各国人民的反帝团结，破坏全世界人民的反帝革命事业。他们是美帝国主义的不折不扣的帮凶。
    但是，美帝国主义也好，它的任何帮凶也好，都不能改变历史发展的辩证规律。美帝国主义在全世界进行侵略的结果，只能是把各国人民的斗争联合起来，而把它自己孤立起来。美帝国主义不可能把世界人民分割开来，却注定要把它自己分割开来。全世界人民的大联合，也就是美帝国主义的大分割。全世界人民团结起来，英勇斗争，就一定会把美帝国主义这个大怪物以及一切牛鬼蛇神一步一步地统统消灭掉。
