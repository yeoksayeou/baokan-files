    A leading cadre, in any work, setting an example and taking the lead in practice is very important, but it must not be limited to this. His more important task is to explore the laws of things in practice, summarize experience, and use it to arm the vast number of cadres, lead everyone, and move forward together. Today, the deeds of Comrade Du Fengming, director of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, introduced in this newspaper, are worth learning from in this regard.
    Is there no waste material to be purchased in the countryside? For a period of time, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative issued notices and held meetings, but it still could not purchase it. What is the problem? Comrade Du Fengming went to the countryside to purchase "scrap" for two days, found the crux of the problem, obtained the right to speak and lead in solving this problem, and promoted the rapid development of waste material purchasing work in the suburbs of Beijing.
      The advanced experience of the "Backpack Store" is very good. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative summarized it, publicized it, and called on everyone to learn from it. Why hasn't it been widely promoted? Comrade Du Fengming personally went deep into the "Backpack Store" and, in the course of common labor, discovered that the reason why the advanced experience of this store had not been widely promoted was that leading cadres at all levels had not truly learned the revolutionary spirit of the "Backpack Store." He learned this revolutionary spirit and thus obtained the right to speak and lead in promoting this advanced experience. Sure enough, this advanced experience was quickly promoted throughout the city.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Any leader who does not obtain specific experience from individual personnel or individual events in individual units at the lower level will not be able to provide universal guidance to all units. This method must be universally promoted so that leading cadres at all levels can learn to use it." Comrade Du Fengming, following Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching, used the leadership method of "breaking through a point and promoting the whole," and within the scope of his work, powerfully played the leading role of "lighting a lamp and illuminating a large area."
    It is indeed commendable that leading cadres like Comrade Du Fengming go deep into the mountains to sell goods with backpacks and go deep into the countryside to purchase "scrap." Of course, Comrade Du Fengming did not achieve this without struggle. More than ten years of urban life and leadership work have unconsciously given him a certain "official airs," and his ideological feelings have become relatively estranged from the masses. Precisely because of this, he felt "shabby" when he picked up a large broom to sweep snow, and he felt embarrassed to shout and sell goods. This kind of emotion is a very dangerous sign for Communists.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "Because of victory, arrogance, complacency, stagnation and unwillingness to make progress, and a desire for enjoyment and reluctance to endure hardship may grow within the Party." In the process of going deep into the countryside, the deep class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for Comrade Du Fengming aroused his memories of the past arduous revolutionary life, and he had an especially deep understanding of Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching. Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and the deep feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants became the driving force for him to transform his thinking and continuously make revolution.
    Comrade Du Fengming's advanced deeds show that leading cadres at all levels need to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works even more, constantly carry out ideological transformation in the process of going deep into reality and going deep among the masses, maintain revolutionary youth forever, play a greater leading role, and do more things for the people.

### 老干部要发挥更大的领导作用

    老干部要发挥更大的领导作用
    一个领导干部，在任何工作中，以身作则，带头实践，是非常重要的，但是，决不能仅仅限于这一点。他的更重要的任务，是要在实践中，探索事物的规律，总结经验，用以武装广大干部，带动大家，共同前进。今天，本报介绍的北京市供销合作社主任杜逢明同志的事迹，在这方面是值得学习的。
    农村里没有什么废旧物资可以收购吗？有一段时间，北京市供销社又发通知，又开会，还是收购不上来。问题究竟在哪里呢？杜逢明同志到农村收购了两天“破烂”，找到了问题的症结，取得了解决这个问题的发言权和领导权，推动了北京郊区废旧物资收购工作的迅速开展。
      “背篓商店”的先进经验好得很，市供销社总结了，宣传了，也号召大家学习了，为什么推而不广呢？杜逢明同志亲自深入“背篓商店”，在共同劳动当中，发现这个商店的先进经验所以推而不广，就在于各级领导干部没有真正学到“背篓商店”的革命精神。他学到了这种革命精神，也就取得了推广这个先进经验的发言权和领导权。果然，这个先进经验很快就在全市推广了。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导。这一方法必须普遍地提倡，使各级领导干部都能学会使用。”杜逢明同志按照毛泽东同志的这个教导，运用“突破一点，推动全盘”的领导方法，在他工作的范围内，有力地发挥了“拨亮一盏灯，照红一大片”的领导作用。
    象杜逢明同志这样的领导干部，深入山区背篓卖货，深入农村收购“破烂”，确实难能可贵。当然，杜逢明同志做到这样，并不是没有斗争的。十几年的城市生活和领导工作，使他不自觉地有了某种“官架子”，同群众的思想感情比较疏远了。正是因为这样，他拿起大笤帚扫雪，觉得“寒伧”，想吆喝卖货，觉得不好开口。这种情绪，对于共产党人来说，是一种非常危险的苗头。
    毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会上指出：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”在深入农村的过程中，贫下中农对杜逢明同志深厚的阶级感情，唤起他对过去艰苦的革命生活的记忆，他对于毛泽东同志的这一教导，体会得格外深切了。毛泽东同志的教导，贫下中农的深情，成为他改造思想，不断革命的动力。
    杜逢明同志的先进事迹说明，各级领导干部更加需要学习毛泽东同志的著作，在深入实际、深入群众的过程中，不断进行思想改造，永葆革命青春，发挥更大的领导作用，为人民作更多的事情。
