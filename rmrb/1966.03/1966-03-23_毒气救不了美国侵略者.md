    Poison Gas Cannot Save the American Aggressors
    While intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is increasingly and frantically using chemical poisons and gases in South Vietnam to destroy crops, kill livestock, create diseases, and slaughter the people. With its extremely inhuman and barbaric crimes, U.S. imperialism is showing the people of the world that it is the most ferocious and brutal aggressor.
    What is particularly infuriating is that U.S. imperialism has turned a deaf ear to the condemnation and protests of fair-minded public opinion in various countries and blatantly announced that it will use poison gas as a "basic standard weapon," and is even using West German militarists to carry out this war crime in South Vietnam. This shows that U.S. imperialism not only inherited the mantle of Hitler fascism, but is even more ferocious and arrogant than it. While engaging in this inhumane act, the Johnson government is still endlessly talking about "seeking peace" and "upholding justice," which is truly the height of shamelessness.
    U.S. imperialism's unscrupulous means in South Vietnam do not indicate its strength, but on the contrary, prove that even with a massive increase in troops, it cannot save its defeat, and therefore has to resort to barbaric means such as poisons and gases. However, no matter what kind of poison or gas, it cannot save the American aggressors. The tragic failure of a series of large-scale "sweeps" launched by the American aggressors in the past two months is the most powerful proof. The more ferocious and brutal U.S. imperialism becomes, the deeper the hatred and the higher the fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people will be. As the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said, no matter how mad and ferocious U.S. imperialism becomes, it cannot escape the fate of complete defeat in South Vietnam.

    毒气救不了美国侵略者
    美帝国主义加紧扩大侵越战争的同时，在越南南方越来越疯狂地使用化学毒药和毒气，破坏庄稼，杀害牲畜，制造疾病，残杀人民。美帝国主义以其极端惨无人道的野蛮罪行，向全世界人民表明它是最凶恶、最残暴的侵略者。
    特别令人发指的是，美帝国主义竟然对世界各国公正舆论的谴责和抗议置若罔闻，明目张胆地宣布要用毒气作为什么“基本标准武器”，而且利用西德军国主义者在南越进行这种战争罪行。这说明美帝国主义不仅继承了希特勒法西斯的衣钵，而且比它还要凶残和狂妄。约翰逊政府在干着这种灭绝人性的勾当的时候，居然还喋喋不休地高谈什么“谋求和平”、“维护正义”，真是可谓无耻到了极点。
    美帝国主义在南越如此的不择手段，并不表明它有力量，而且恰恰相反，证明它虽然大量增兵也无法挽救败局，因而不得不乞灵于毒药、毒气这些野蛮的手段。但是，不管什么样的毒药、毒气，都是救不了美国侵略者的。美国侵略者近两个月来发动的一系列大“扫荡”的悲惨失败就是最有力的证明。美帝国主义越凶恶、残暴，南越人民的仇恨就越增深，斗志就越高昂。正如越南民主共和国外交部的声明中所说的，不管美帝国主义疯狂和凶恶到什么程度，也摆脱不了在越南南方彻底失败的命运。
