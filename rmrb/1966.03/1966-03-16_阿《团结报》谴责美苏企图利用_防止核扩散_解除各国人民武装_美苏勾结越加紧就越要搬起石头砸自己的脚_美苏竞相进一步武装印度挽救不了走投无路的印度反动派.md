    Albanian "Unity Newspaper" Condemns US-Soviet Attempts to Use "Nuclear Non-Proliferation" to Disarm the People of All Countries
    The Closer the US-Soviet Collusion, the Sooner They Will Lift a Rock Only to Drop it on Their Own Feet
    US and Soviet Union Compete to Further Arm India, But This Cannot Save the Desperate Indian Reactionaries
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 13 (Electric dispatch) - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on March 13, pointing out that the Geneva Disarmament Conference has become a political exchange between the two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. They attempt to dominate the world through the platform of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, legalize nuclear monopoly, and disarm the people of all countries. The Disarmament Conference is used to divert public opinion from the real events of the present day and to create illusions about the so-called "great powers."
    The commentary stated that the only issue discussed at this conference, the "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," means encouraging the heinous aggression of US imperialism in Vietnam. It means closing one's eyes to the rampant arms race of imperialist powers and to the threat of the 2,500 US military bases scattered around the world, especially the military bases that "encircle" and "contain" the People's Republic of China. The commentary pointed out that what imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists dream of is attempting to disarm the people of all countries through a "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons" agreement, maintain the status of nuclear powers, and attack countries and peoples that do not listen to US commands or engage in genuine struggles for universal disarmament. However, their sinister actions have met with resolute opposition from the people of all countries.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the Khrushchev revisionists' capitulationist stance on this issue shows how deeply they have sunk into betraying the revolutionary and peaceful interests of the people of all countries.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 13 (Electric dispatch) - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on March 13, condemning the US imperialism and Khrushchev revisionists for continuing to arm the Indian reactionaries in order to further their conspiracy to invade China and other countries in Asia.
    The commentary stated that while the Soviet and American propaganda machines are vigorously touting the "benefits" of the "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons" treaty at the Geneva Conference, as if this were a direct step towards disarmament, US imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists are competing in India to see who can provide this large Asian country with more and better weapons. According to the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and India on March 7, the Khrushchev revisionists will provide India with forty MI-4 helicopters worth $4.5 million.
    The commentary stated that India is the link in the cooperation between US imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism. It is increasingly being used as the center of a conspiracy to create threats to the security of Asian countries. It plays the role of a provocateur against the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Pakistan, and Southeast Asian countries.
    The commentary concluded by pointing out that the further arming of India by US imperialists and modern revisionists is part of the US imperialist "global strategy." However, what the starving people of India are asking for is bread, work, and freedom, not weapons. In order to oppose the anti-national and anti-people policies of their government, the Indian people are launching vigorous demonstration struggles at home. The recent large-scale armed rebellion by the Mizo tribes clearly shows that the Indian reactionary government has fallen into a desperate situation.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 12 (Electric dispatch) - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on March 12, condemning the anti-China clamor of the US ruling clique.
    The commentary stated that the only purpose of the United States gathering a large number of military forces in the Far East and Southeast Asia and sending diplomats to engage in activities in Asia is to establish an encirclement around the People's Republic of China.
    The commentary stated that although the adventurous plans of the US imperialists have received the support and cooperation of the Soviet revisionists, they have aroused the indignation of the people of all countries in the world. The imperialist ringleaders have begun to launch a widespread anti-China propaganda campaign, trying their best to portray China as the greatest danger to peace, a country that attempts to export revolution to other countries and to impose its rule on the whole of Asia. The commentary pointed out that their attacks have not diminished but have instead enhanced the prestige of the People's Republic of China in the eyes of the people of all countries, who rightfully regard US imperialism as their greatest enemy. The US's nuclear blackmail against China has further strengthened the people of all countries' hatred of the aggressors, further heightened the vigilance of the people of all countries, and launched even greater revolutionary movements in all countries of the world. The stone that the US imperialists are trying to use to strike at the People's Republic of China is falling on the US imperialists' own feet. There is no doubt that the evil aggressors will be completely defeated.

### 阿《团结报》谴责美苏企图利用“防止核扩散”解除各国人民武装  美苏勾结越加紧就越要搬起石头砸自己的脚  美苏竞相进一步武装印度挽救不了走投无路的印度反动派

    阿《团结报》谴责美苏企图利用“防止核扩散”解除各国人民武装
    美苏勾结越加紧就越要搬起石头砸自己的脚
    美苏竞相进一步武装印度挽救不了走投无路的印度反动派
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十三日发表评论指出，日内瓦裁军会议已经成为苏美两大国的政治交易所，它们企图通过日内瓦裁军会议的讲坛来称霸世界并使核垄断合法化，解除各国人民的武装。裁军会议被用来转移公众舆论对当代真正事件的注意，并且制造对所谓“大国”的幻想。
    评论说，这次会议唯一讨论的“不扩散核武器”问题意味着鼓励美帝国主义对越南的罪恶侵略，意味着在帝国主义大国放肆的军备竞赛面前闭上眼睛，在美国遍布世界各地的二千五百个军事基地、特别是在“包围”和“遏制”中华人民共和国的军事基地的威胁面前闭上眼睛。评论指出，帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者梦寐以求的是企图通过“不扩散核武器”协议，来解除各国人民的武装，维护核大国的地位，打击不听从美国指挥或者为普遍裁军而进行真正斗争的国家和人民。但是，他们的罪恶行动受到了世界各国人民的坚决反对。
    评论最后说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在这个问题上的投降主义立场表明，他们对世界各国人民革命与和平利益的背叛已经陷入到了多么深的程度。
    据新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十三日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者继续武装印度反动派，以便进一步侵略中国和亚洲其他国家的阴谋。
    评论说，正当苏美宣传机器在日内瓦会议上大肆鼓吹关于“不扩散核武器”条约的“好处”，似乎这是直接导向裁军的一个步骤的时候，美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却在印度进行竞赛，看谁对这个亚洲大国提供的武器更多、更好。根据苏联和印度三月七日达成的协定，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者将向印度提供价值四百五十万美元的四十架Ml—4型直升飞机。
    评论说，印度是美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义合作的纽带，它日益被用来作为制造威胁亚洲各国安全的阴谋的中心，它扮演着反对中华人民共和国、巴基斯坦共和国和东南亚各国的挑衅者的角色。
    评论最后指出，美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者进一步武装印度，是美帝国主义“全球战略”的一部分。但是，正在遭受饥饿的印度人民所要求的是面包、工作和自由，而不是武器。为了反对他们政府的反民族、反人民的政策，印度人民正在国内展开有力的示威斗争。最近米佐部族人民举行的大规模武装暴动清楚表明，印度反动政府已经陷入了走投无路的境地。
    据新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十二日发表评论，谴责美国统治集团的反华叫嚣。
    评论说，美国在远东和东南亚集结大批军事力量和派遣外交官到亚洲活动、其唯一目的就是要在中华人民共和国的周围建立包围圈。
    评论说，虽然美帝国主义者的冒险计划得到了苏联修正主义者的支持和合作，但是却激起了世界各国人民的愤慨。帝国主义头子开始掀起一场广泛的反华宣传运动，竭力把中国说成是和平的最大危险，是企图向其它国家输出革命和企图把自己的统治强加于整个亚洲的一个国家。评论指出，他们的攻击不但没有降低，而是更加提高了中华人民共和国在世界各国人民眼中的威望，各国人民都理所当然地把美帝国主义看作是最大的敌人。美国对中国的武力讹诈更加增强了各国人民对侵略者的憎恨，进一步提高了各国人民的警惕性并且在世界各国展开了更加巨大的革命运动。美帝国主义者企图打击中华人民共和国的石头正落到美帝国主义自己的脚上。毫无疑问，万恶的侵略者必将遭到彻底的失败。
