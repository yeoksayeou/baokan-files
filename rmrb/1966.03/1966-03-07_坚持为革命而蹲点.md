    I started stationing myself at the Da Xidi Brigade in May 1964. At the beginning, going down to station myself at a point wasn't a conscious decision. I didn't have a clear understanding of how to station myself or how to go deep into the work. At that time, I thought that as long as a person was at the point, the situation was investigated at the point, meetings were held at the point, and work was done at the point, that was enough. My thinking hadn't come down, and my working methods hadn't changed; I was still using the same old methods from the office. I relied on listening to reports and making phone calls to understand the situation, and I moved around within the cadre circle; I used the method of holding large meetings to arrange work, relying on old experience and clichés for each task. Using these methods to do leadership work didn't seem to be a problem when I was in the office, but it didn't work at all when I went down.
    One thing that was very educational for me was the cotton planting in 1964. I had just arrived at the point at that time. The progress of cotton planting in the county was slow, and the quality of some of it wasn't very good. To solve this problem, I hurriedly convened a meeting of commune cadres and county cadres stationed in the countryside in the Chengguan Commune. The meeting lasted until late at night. Some said that the slow progress was a problem of ideology, others said it was due to ineffective measures, and so on. What was the crux of the problem? What ideological problems were there? What measures would be considered effective? I couldn't figure it out. Because I hadn't personally participated in the practice and obtained first-hand material, I couldn't judge right from wrong or convince everyone. In the end, I had to rely on everyone's opinions and my past experience to barely summarize the experience of grasping the "five implementations" (task, ideology, measures, quality, leadership) in current agricultural production. Immediately afterward, I convened a "on-site meeting" with cadres from three communes participating. Although the meeting was held on-site, it was still the same old routine of having a meeting first, a report second, a discussion third, and a conclusion fourth. As a result, everyone was uninterested. They said, "What you said about implementing tasks and ensuring quality is all very good, but what we want is how to plant in a timely manner?" At this point, I realized that these "experiences" seemed to come from the point, but they didn't actually come from practice, they were very superficial and couldn't solve the problem. Therefore, I rooted myself in a production team within the brigade as a point within a point and personally participated in the practice. At that time, I discovered that the main problem was that some cadres and masses had the idea of planting late, so they were standing still. After the problem was discovered, I created a model in the production team and held a meeting on-site, raising questions and presenting the situation for everyone to discuss. This time, I finally found out that the reason for the slow planting progress was the existence of complacency among cadres and masses and the lack of specific organizational work. Once the main problem was solved, the planting progress in the county accelerated.
    After this incident, I studied Chairman Mao's article "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" with the question of how to fundamentally change my style of work. Chairman Mao taught us: "Correct ideas of people can only come from social practice, from their three kinds of practice in society, the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment." I then realized that the main problem in my work was that my body had arrived at the point, but my thinking hadn't, and I hadn't truly gone deep into reality and hadn't broken with the old leadership style. The reason for this was that I hadn't completely revolutionized myself, and I was afraid of a hard life and difficult work.
    Once my understanding improved, I got rid of administrative affairs and resolved to stay at the point. First, I grasped the key of participating in collective productive labor, because only through labor can I gain the trust of the masses and become one with the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the beginning, I went to the Fourth Production Team to prepare the land, but because I hadn't really put down my airs, I sometimes showed the airs of a "commander" and couldn't treat labor as an ordinary worker. Therefore, the commune members said that I didn't look like a peasant. This criticism educated me. From then on, I resolved to participate in labor in a down-to-earth manner and transform myself through labor.
    After stationing myself at the point, I resolutely implemented the "three togethers" (eat, live, and work together), personally changed reality, and personally solved contradictions. In terms of work style and methods, I gradually explored "three destructions and three establishments": destroy the generalized appeals of the bureaucratic work style, establish the work style of going deep into reality, finding experience, and driving the overall situation; destroy the method of grasping everything but not tightly, establish the method of having a point within a point, grasping the point deeply, making breakthroughs first, and creating models; destroy the bureaucratic work style, establish the mass line work style of coming from the masses and going to the masses. After resolving to change the leadership style and eating, living, and working together with the commune members, I began to taste the sweetness of going deep into reality. I accumulated a lot of perceptual material and learned about many things that I couldn't have learned when I was stationed in the office and listening to reports. When guiding work again, I had a bottom line in my heart, there were more methods, and my words carried weight. For example, in the cotton planting work, what were the specific problems? I only figured it out when I participated in labor at the Da Xidi point. In response to these problems, I and the commune members studied and improved the methods and proposed five "no plantings": no planting if the land is not level, no planting if base fertilizer is not applied, no planting if the variety is not right, no planting if seeds are not soaked and mixed with pesticides, no planting if the plowmen are not well trained.
    For example, in July 1965, most of the commune teams' cotton buds and bolls were falling off, some very seriously, threatening cotton production. I brought this problem and held an on-site meeting at the point with the participation of branch secretaries from sixteen villages and comrades from the technical extension station. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's works with problems, and labored and practiced in the cotton fields with problems. They found five major reasons for the shedding of buds and bolls: bollworm damage, incomplete pruning, insufficient nutrition, anthracnose, and man-made boll damage. Everyone also, through repeated practice, believed that the main contradiction to prevent boll shedding was water, followed by fertilizer. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the mood of complacency and slackness, and attack cotton with both water and fertilizer, protect buds and bolls, increase the number of bolls, increase the weight, and increase production. This measure was promoted to the surface and quickly took effect. From then on, we insisted on the method of discovering problems through labor.
    Stationing at a point is an important measure to improve the leadership style and implement the leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses. For more than a year of stationing at the point, I deeply feel that we must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, not be afraid of hardship or difficulties, and insist on stationing at the point for the revolution in order to do a good job. Otherwise, if the person goes down but the thinking doesn't, and the style of work doesn't change, it's just a formal stationing, and the effect is not great.

    坚持为革命而蹲点
    河北望都县委代理书记　马国庆
    我从一九六四年五月开始到大西堤大队蹲点。下去蹲点，开头并不是自觉的。对于怎样蹲点、怎样深入工作，没有明确的认识。那时认为反正人到了点上，情况在点上摸，会议在点上开，工作在点上做，这就算蹲了点。思想没有下来，工作方法没有改变，还是原来在机关的那一套。了解情况靠听汇报、打电话，在干部圈子里转；布置工作用开大会的方法，每项工作凭老经验老生常谈一顿。用这些方法做领导工作，过去在机关时还没有感觉到不行，一到下边就不灵验了。
    有一件事情对我的教育很深刻。一九六四年棉花播种的时候，我刚刚到点上。当时全县种棉的进度较慢，有的质量不太好。为解决这个问题，我急忙在城关公社召开了公社干部和县下乡干部会议。会议一直开到深夜。有的说进度慢是思想问题，有的说是由于措施不力等等，其说不一。问题的症结何在？到底有哪些思想问题？什么措施才算有力？弄不清楚。由于自己没有亲身参加实践，取得第一手材料，也无法判明是非，说服大家。最后，只好根据大家的意见，凭着以往的经验，勉强总结了当前农业生产抓五落实（任务、思想、措施、质量、领导）的经验。紧接着召开了三个公社干部参加的“现场会”。会议虽然是在现场开，可是仍然是一开会，二报告，三讨论，四结论的老套套。结果大家都不感兴趣。说：“你说的要落实任务、保证质量等等，都很好，可我们要的是到底怎样适时播种？”这时使我感到，这些“经验”看来好象是点上来的，实际上不是从实践中来的，很浮浅，解决不了问题。为此，我由大队扎根到一个生产队，作为点中之点，亲身参加实践。当时发现主要问题是有些干部、群众有晚种的思想，所以按兵不动。问题发现以后，就在生产队搞出样板，又在现场开会，提问题，摆情况，大家讨论。这次终于找出了播种进度慢的原因，是干部、群众中存在麻痹思想和缺乏具体的组织工作。主要问题解决了，全县播种进度就加快了。
    这件事情过后，我就带着怎样从根本上改变作风这一问题，学习了毛主席的《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》这篇文章。毛主席教导我们说：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”我才认识到工作中的主要问题是自己身子到了点上，思想还没有来到点上，还没有真正深入实际，还没有与旧的领导作风决裂。所以如此，是由于自己还没有彻底革命化，怕生活艰苦，怕工作困难。
    认识提高了，我就摆脱了行政事务，下决心蹲了下来。首先抓住了参加集体生产劳动这一条，因为只有劳动才能取得群众的信任，才能同贫下中农合成一体。开始，我到第四生产队整地，由于自己还没有真正放下架子，有时“指挥官”的派头又拿了出来，不能以普通劳动者的身份对待劳动。因此社员们说我不象庄稼人。这个批评，使我受到了教育。从此，下定决心踏踏实实地参加劳动，在劳动中改造自己。
    蹲下来以后，坚决实行“三同”，亲手变革现实，亲手解决矛盾。在工作作风和方法上，逐步摸索“三破三立”：破一般号召的机关化的作风，立深入实际，找出经验，带动全面的作风；破样样都抓，抓而不紧的方法，立点中有点，抓点抓深，先行突破，搞出样板的方法；破官僚主义作风，立从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线作风。经过下决心转变领导作风，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，开始尝到了深入实际的甜头。手头上积累了许多感性材料，了解到许多过去蹲机关、听汇报时根本了解不到的情况。这样再指导工作，心里就有底了，办法也多了，说话有份量了。例如在棉花播种工作中，到底有哪些具体问题？我在大西堤点上参加劳动中才弄清楚。针对这些问题，我和社员们研究改进办法，提出了五不耩：地不平不耩，不施底肥不耩，品种不对不耩，不浸种拌种不耩，不训练好扶耧手不耩。
    又如一九六五年七月份，大部分社队的棉花蕾铃脱落，有的脱落得很严重，威胁着棉花增产。我带着这个问题，在点上召开了有十六个村的支部书记、技术推广站同志参加的现场会，大家带着问题学习毛主席著作，带着问题在棉田劳动、实践。对蕾铃脱落找出了五大原因：棉铃虫危害，整枝不细，营养不足，有炭疽病和人为的伤铃。大家又通过反复实践，认为要防止落铃主要矛盾是水，其次是肥。因此，必须克服麻痹松劲情绪，对棉花要水肥齐攻，保蕾保铃，增铃重，增产量。这个措施推到面上，很快奏效了。从此，我们坚持了通过劳动发现问题的办法。
    蹲点是改进领导作风，实行从群众中来、到群众中去的领导方法的重要措施，蹲点一年多以来，深深感到必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，不怕苦，不怕困难，坚持为革命而蹲点，才能蹲得好。否则，人下去思想不下去，作风不改变，只是形式上的蹲点，效果不大。
