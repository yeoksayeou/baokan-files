    In the Days of Conquering Huangtiandang
    Jiang Zongrong
      "The Municipal Party Committee has approved our plan to reclaim 600 mu of land in Huangtiandang!" As soon as this news spread, the entire Qunli Brigade burst into excitement.
    The Qunli Brigade is located on the banks of Huangtiandang in the eastern suburbs of Suzhou, surrounded by water on three sides and low-lying. At the beginning of this year, the commune members launched a vigorous "Learn from Dazhai, Create Dazhai" movement. Now, in order to better welcome the motherland's Third Five-Year Plan, they have put forward the resounding slogan of "Asking for land from the water surface, asking for grain from the lake bottom" and formulated a battle plan to reclaim Huangtiandang. Now that the leadership has approved this plan, how can the commune members not be happy!
    To reclaim Huangtiandang, we must first build a dike to block the river water. At the oath-taking rally the day before the battle, Jin Quansheng, the Party Branch Secretary, issued a resounding call to the commune members: For the sake of the revolution, for the sake of benefiting future generations, we must establish Dazhai ambitions, be Dazhai people, take the Dazhai road, and use our iron hands to overcome all difficulties and conquer Huangtiandang.
    The commune members were even more high-spirited, and letters of determination and guarantees flew into the venue like snowflakes. February 6th was the first day of the battle.
    In the early morning, when the Huangtiandang was still shrouded in a thin mist, more than 170 farm boats were flying back and forth on the river like shuttles, transporting load after load of soil from Xiangmen, two li away, from Yangnianqiao, three li away, and from Nanbang, four li away.
    When the commune members were rowing their boats to Yangnianqiao to transport soil, they found that the foundation of the dam at the construction site was shallow, making it inconvenient for boats to travel and affecting the progress of the project. Pan Jinrong, a poor peasant representative from the 30th team, immediately rolled up his trouser legs, braved the bitter cold, and stood in the icy water to dredge the mud until the river channel was clear and boats full of mud could travel unhindered before coming ashore.
    Early in the morning, the Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and several leading comrades from the Suburban Working Committee and the Commune Party Committee came to the various construction sites and worked with the commune members. The commune members excitedly said: "These are good cadres sent by Chairman Mao. Leading comrades are working with us, and our enthusiasm is even greater."
    Time passed day by day, and the earthen dam was constantly lengthening, one li, two li, three li... However, on the night of the 20th, a gale of force seven or eight suddenly blew. The wind, carrying rain and snow, caused turbulent waves in the Huangtiandang. Storms and floods violently beat against the earthen dam, scattering the mud and sweeping away the grass bags.
    On the morning of the 21st, the wind and snow grew heavier. Xu Jingnan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, led several brigade cadres to the construction site against the wind and waves. The scene that unfolded before them was: a long section of the earthen dam had collapsed, and a long row of grass bags had been swept away by the flood. The wind and rain were still roaring, and the waves were still raging.
    The cadres suddenly saw that a section of the earthen dam, built with stones, stood firm, resisting the wind and waves. However, the brigade didn't have any stones, so what to do?
      "Let the masses see, discuss with the masses, and there will always be a way!" the cadres all said.
    So, Deputy Brigade Leader Xu Sannan led more than 200 commune members who had just finished studying the article "Jiao Yulu - The Example of a County Party Secretary" to the earthen dam site to observe. Back at the general meeting place, everyone discussed loudly: "The section of the earthen dam built with stones hasn't been damaged. It seems that we can only build with stones to resist!" "If the old heavens want to destroy it, we won't allow it. We must defeat it!"
    Guo Quansheng, a poor peasant commune member from the 28th team, excitedly said: "My family has a pig shed that is already broken. I'll tear it down and give the stones to the brigade to build the dike."
    "We have stones at home, we'll take the lead!" many production team leaders said.
    Before long, piles of stones appeared near the earthen dam.
    Jin A'er, Zhang Maonan, Zhong Haigen and other six young people from the 50th team not only carried the stones from their own homes to the construction site, but also rocked two boats to dig up many stones from the river and sent them to the construction site. The construction site manager wanted to issue them work point tickets, but they resolutely refused.
    Lu Jinfa, a poor peasant commune member from the 21st team, sent all the stones from his home. The construction site manager wanted to issue him work point tickets, but he said: "These are what I usually pick up. It is right to dedicate them to the brigade to repair the dike, so why issue work point tickets?"
    The commune members all refused work point tickets. What to do? The branch leadership immediately conducted research and clearly pointed out: "The higher the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must pay attention to handling affairs in accordance with policies. Work point tickets must be issued. If they don't take them, we will record them in the account and settle them later at the price."
    Cadres talk about policies, take the lead in doing, the masses are in high spirits, and the enthusiasm is great. Everyone expressed that they must overcome the old heavens and seize victory.
    To build stones on the constructed earthen dam, only three hundred tons of stones is far from enough. When the relevant departments in Suzhou City learned about this matter, they promptly approved them to transport some rubble from Huangshan. From Huangtiandang to Huangshan, it takes 21 li of waterways, and from the stone extraction point to the river, it takes three or four hundred meters of road, and the mountain road is uneven, making it difficult to transport stones.
    However, these difficulties did not scare the commune members. Under the leadership of Party branch member Xu Xianggen, they organized a stone transport commando team, borrowed ten small flatbed trucks from the construction company, and were specially responsible for the task of stone extraction and land transportation in Huangshan. Two people pushed a truck. Originally, it was estimated that each truck could only transport ten times a day, but on the first day, each truck transported twenty-five times.
    The land transportation problem was solved. How to arrange the water transportation task? The boats are all concentrated in Huangtiandang to carry mud, how to schedule them? They decided to use the method of "people rest, boats don't rest" to concentrate on rushing to transport stones at night.
    One day, Wang Jinlin, Niu Guojin, Niu Funan, and Wu Fengxing, four young people, silently rocked a boat each to Huangshan to transport stones. The weather was bad that day, and the wind was strong and the sky was dark when they returned, but they were enthusiastic and energetic, and said boldly: "Even if we encounter greater difficulties, we must rush to transport the stones back!" With such enthusiasm and perseverance, they finally transported all the stones back at more than twelve o'clock in the middle of the night.
    Now, on the side of the four and a half li long earthen dam newly built in Huangtiandang, more than 800 meters of stone embankment has been built.
    The commune members of the Qunli Brigade have received strong support from many fraternal brigades and urban people for building dikes and reclaiming Huangtiandang. This kind of revolutionary selfless assistance has given the commune members of the Qunli Brigade great encouragement.
    One day, the Jiangdun Brigade of Hengtang Commune rocked fifteen boats of mud to Huangtiandang to support the Qunli Brigade. When the commune members of the Qunli Brigade saw this, they were very moved and wanted to fill fifteen boats of mud for them to take back while they were ashore to rest, so they secretly borrowed more than a dozen mud baskets. Unexpectedly, this "scheme" was discovered by the Jiangdun commune members at the time. They resolutely refused to go ashore to rest, but instead rocked the boats to the Renminqiao construction site to help transport fifteen boats of mud.
    One day, the commune members of the Qunli Brigade were taking mud at the Renminqiao construction site. Suddenly, a middle-aged man came riding a bicycle and asked: "Are you from the Qunli Brigade?" Xu Fengxiang, the person in charge of the construction site, replied with a smile: "Yes, what's the matter?" The man nodded, said "Yes", and hurriedly rode his bicycle away. After a while, he led a few people carrying stones and came over, smiling and saying to Xu Fengxiang: "Originally we wanted to bring a few boats of mud, but we didn't have time. Today we came to the nearby rice mill to load rice husks. We brought seven 'fei wo' (note) here. Please accept this little token of our appreciation." After speaking, they all left quickly.
    There is no end to such things.
    Why did they do this? Facts are the best answer. On the morning of March 4, more than 500 commune members of the Youlian Brigade went to the Qunli Brigade to visit. Regardless of men, women, old or young, those who carried, those who carried on their backs, those who carried on poles, everyone brought mud. The cadres and commune members of the Qunli Brigade repeatedly thanked them, but they replied: "Class brothers are relatives, and it is right to support each other for the revolution!"
    Yes, what is closer than class brothers? What is deeper than revolutionary friendship? This profound revolutionary friendship, class friendship, has further stimulated the revolutionary fighting spirit of the commune members of the Qunli Brigade. They call the built dam "the revolutionary friendship dam", and they are determined to repay the fraternal brigades with practical actions.

    在征服黄天荡的日子里
    江宗荣
      “市委已经批准我们围垦黄天荡六百亩土地的计划啦！”这个消息一传开，整个群力大队顿时沸腾起来了。
    群力大队在苏州市东郊的黄天荡畔，三面临水，地势低洼。今年年初，社员们轰轰烈烈地展开了“学大寨、创大寨”运动。现在，他们为了更好地迎接祖国第三个五年计划，又提出了“向水面要田，向湖底要粮”的响亮口号，制订了围垦黄天荡的战斗计划。现在，领导上批准了这个计划，社员们怎么能不高兴呢！
    要围垦黄天荡，先要筑条堤坝，挡住河水。在战斗前一天的誓师大会上，党支部书记金泉生响亮地向社员们发出号召：为了革命，为了给子孙万代造福，我们要立大寨志，做大寨人，走大寨路，用我们的一双铁手，去排除万难，战胜黄天荡。
    社员们更是意气风发，决心书、保证书如雪片一样飞进会场。二月六日，这是战斗的第一天。
    清晨，当黄天荡里还飘散着薄薄的晨雾的时候，一百七十多条农船便象穿梭似的来回飞驰在河面，从二里外的巷门里，从三里外的杨年桥，从四里外的南浜，运来了一船又一船的泥土。
    在社员们摇着船来到杨年桥运泥时，发现工地上的坝基浅，船只行驶不便，影响工程进度。三十队的贫农代表潘金荣立即卷起裤管，冒着严寒，站在冰冷的水里扒泥，直到河道畅通，装满泥土的船只行驶无阻时，才走上岸来。
    清早，市委副书记和郊区工委、公社党委几位领导同志，来到各工地和社员们一起干活。社员们激动地说：“这是毛主席派来的好干部，领导同志和我们一起劳动，我们的劲头更大了。”
    时间一天天过去了，土坝在不断地伸长，一里、两里、三里……可是，就在二十日夜里，突然刮起了七八级的大风。风带着雨水，夹着雪花，使黄天荡里掀起了汹涌的水浪。暴风、洪水，猛烈地拍打着土坝，击散了泥土，卷走了草包。
    二十一日清晨，风雪越来越大，党支部副书记许京南带领几个大队干部，迎着风浪来到工地。展现在他们眼前的景象是：一段长长的土坝被冲坍，一长排草包被洪水卷走。风雨还在咆哮，水浪还在怒吼。
    干部们猛然看到，有一段砌着石头的土坝巍然屹立，抵住了风浪。可是，大队没有石头，怎么办？
      “让群众来看看，找群众商量，总会有办法的！”干部们都这么说。
    于是，副大队长许三男带领了刚学完《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇文章的二百多名社员，来到土坝现场观看。回到大会场，大家大声议论起来：“那段砌着石头的土坝没冲坏，看来只有砌石头阻挡！”“老天要破坏，我们不答应，一定要斗倒它！”
    二十八队贫农社员郭泉生激动地说：“我家里有一个猪棚，已经坏了，把它拆掉，石头给大队筑堤坝。”
    “我们家里有石头，我们带头！”许多生产队长都这么说。
    不一会，土坝附近就出现了一堆堆的石头。
    五十队青年金阿二、章毛男、仲海根等六人，不仅将自己家里的石头扛到工地，而且还摇了两条船去河里挖了好多石头，送到工地。工地管理员要给他们开工分票，他们坚决不要。
    二十一队贫农社员陆进法将家里的石头都送了来。工地管理员要给他开工票，他说：“这是我平时拾来的，献给大队修堤是应该的，还开什么工票？”
    社员们都不要工票，这怎么办呢？支部领导立即进行了研究，并明确地指出：“群众的情绪越是高涨，我们越是要注意按照政策办事。工分票一定要开，他们不拿，我们给记在账上，以后按价格结算。”
    干部讲政策，带头干，群众情绪高，干劲大。人人表示一定要战胜老天，夺取胜利。
    要在筑成的土坝旁砌上石头，仅有三百吨石头，远远不够。当苏州市有关部门知道这事后，及时批准他们去黄山运载一些乱石。从黄天荡到黄山，要行二十一里路的水道，而且从取石地点到河道边，要走三、四百米路，山路又高低不平，运石有困难。
    但是，这些困难并没能把社员们吓住，他们在党支部委员许祥根的带领下，组织了一支运石突击队，向建筑公司商借了十部小板车，专门负责在黄山取石和陆路运输任务。他们两人推一部车，原来估计每天每车只能运十次，可他们第一天每车就运了二十五次。
    陆路运输问题解决了，水上的运输任务怎么安排？船只都集中在黄天荡里载泥，怎么调度呢？他们决定用“人休息船不休息”的办法，利用晚上时间突击抢运。
    一天，王金林、钮国金、钮福男、吴凤兴四个青年，不声不响地每人摇了一条船，去黄山运石。这一天天气不好，回来时风大天黑，可他们心热干劲足，豪迈地说：“就是碰到再大的困难，我们也要把石头抢运回去！”凭着这样的干劲和毅力，他们终于在深夜十二点多把石头全部运回。
    现在，在黄天荡新筑的长达四里半的土坝旁，已经筑起了八百余米长的石岸。
    群力大队社员们筑堤坝，围垦黄天荡，得到了许多兄弟社队、城市人民的大力支援。这种革命的无私的援助，给了群力大队社员很大的鼓舞。
    一天，横塘公社蒋墩大队摇了十五船泥来到黄天荡，支援群力大队。群力大队社员看到后，很受感动，想趁他们上岸休息时，给他们罱满十五船泥回去，就暗暗地借了十多只罱泥箩头来。不料，这一“计谋”当时就被蒋墩社员发觉，他们坚决不肯上岸休息，反而还摇了船去人民桥工地帮助运送了十五船泥。
    一天，群力大队社员正在人民桥工地上取泥，忽然一位中年人骑着自行车来询问：“你们是群力大队吗？”工地负责人许凤祥笑着回答道：“是呀，你有什么事？”那人点了点头，说了声“有”，就急忙骑了自行车飞驰而去。不一会儿，他带领了几个扛着石头的人走来，笑着对许凤祥说：“本来我们想带几船泥来，可是没工夫，今天来附近米厂装砻糠，我们带了七只飞硪（注）来，这一点心意，你们收下吧。”说完，他们都飞快地走了。
    这样的事情说也说不完。
    他们为什么这样做呢？事实是最好的回答。三月四日上午，友联大队的五百多社员前往群力大队参观，他们不分男女老少，扛的扛，背的背，挑的挑，每人都带来了泥。群力大队干部、社员再三向他们道谢，可他们却回答说：“阶级弟兄是亲人，为了革命，相互支援，这是应该的嘛！”
    是的，有什么能比阶级弟兄更亲呢？有什么能比革命友情更深呢？这种深厚的革命友情，阶级友情，更激发了群力大队社员的革命斗志，他们称筑起的坝为“革命的友谊坝”，他们决心要以实际行动来向兄弟社队答谢。
