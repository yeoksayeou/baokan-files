    Xinhua News Agency, 28th. An observer article in the Peruvian Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," exposed that the Soviet revisionist group, under the smokescreen of "struggle against the cult of personality of Stalin," is pushing the Soviet economy onto the road of capitalist restoration.

    The article said, "After Stalin's death, due to the Khrushchev group's usurpation of Soviet power and the leadership of the CPSU, the phenomenon that Lenin had condemned, 'all the evils inherent in bourgeois parliamentarism are constantly reviving,' has run rampant under the banner of 'struggle against the cult of personality of Stalin.' Khrushchevism is precisely the political reflection of that constant revival of 'all the evils inherent in bourgeois parliamentarism.'"

    Referring to the "reform" measures implemented by Khrushchev's successors in the economic field, the article pointed out that this kind of economy "based on 'profits,' 'material incentives,' 'supply and demand,' 'giving managers and administrators greater authority,' and 'flexible (implementation of) planned economy' is nothing but a return to capitalist economy."

    The article pointed out, "More seriously, the Soviet state is no longer a proletarian dictatorship, but a 'state of the whole people,' and the party is no longer the organized vanguard of the working class, but a 'party of the whole people.'"

    The article said that Khrushchev's successors can swear a thousand times that they will never "return to capitalism"; these oaths are worthless. The objective reality is that "freedom of trade," "profits," "material incentives," and the replacement of party organs with "technical institutions" in the administrative management of enterprises, as well as a series of sabotages of the planned economy, are causing serious chaos in the Soviet socialist economy and pushing this economy onto the road of capitalist restoration.

    The article said, "To insist that relying on the current economic policies implemented in the Soviet Union is to build communism is a clumsy deception. The leaders of the Chinese fraternal party, in their Nine Commentaries on the Open Letter of the CPSU Central Committee, timely and powerfully exposed the false communism of Khrushchev's revisionism. Everything that has happened in the Soviet Union since that commentary was published, including the most recent CPSU Central Committee plenum (referring to the September plenum of last year, at which measures to so-called "reform" the economy were adopted - editor), has confirmed the irrefutable truth of the powerful exposure made by the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party."

    The article pointed out, "Khrushchevites without Khrushchev are merely agents and tools of the international bourgeoisie." The so-called "'all-round (construction) of communism' is a clumsy deception and a disgraceful betrayal."

    The article concluded, "The Soviet people will eventually shoulder their own mission and cast aside all kinds of Khrushchev elements."

    秘共《红旗报》揭露苏共领导的拙劣骗局和可耻背叛
    苏共领导正把苏联推向资本主义复辟道路
    事实证明了中国对赫鲁晓夫集团假共产主义的揭露是真实的
    新华社二十八日讯 秘鲁共产党机关报《红旗报》在一篇观察家文章中揭露苏联修正主义集团在
  “反对斯大林个人迷信斗争”的烟幕下，正在把苏联经济推向资本主义复辟的道路。
    文章说，“斯大林逝世后，由于赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺了苏维埃政权和苏共领导，列宁所斥责过的那种
  ‘资产阶级议会制所固有的一切坏处都在不断地复活着’的现象，在挥舞着
  ‘反对斯大林个人迷信斗争’的旗号下大肆泛滥。赫鲁晓夫主义正是‘资产阶级议会制所固有的一切坏处’的那种不断复活在政治上的反映。”
    文章在谈到赫鲁晓夫的继承者在经济上所实行的“改革”措施时指出，这种“基于‘收益’、‘利润’、‘物质刺激’、‘供求’和‘给经理和管理人员以更大职权’、‘灵活（执行）计划经济’的经济不是别的，而是返回资本主义经济。”
    文章指出，“更严重的是，苏维埃国家已经不是一个无产阶级专政的政权，而是一个‘全民国家’，党已经不是工人阶级有组织的先锋队，而是一个‘全民党’。”
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫的继承者可以一千次地宣誓说，绝不“回到资本主义”；这些誓言没有任何价值。客观现实是，“贸易自由”、“利润”、“物质刺激”和在企业的行政管理中用“技术机构”代替党的机构，以及对计划经济的一系列的破坏，在苏联社会主义经济中正引起严重的混乱，并把这一经济推上了资本主义复辟的道路。
    文章说，“硬说依靠在苏联实行的现行经济政策是建设共产主义，那是拙劣的欺骗。中国兄弟党的领导人在他们的九评苏共中央公开信中及时地有力地揭露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的假共产主义。从那篇评论发表以来，在苏联发生的一切事情，包括最近一次苏共中央全会（指去年九月全会，会上通过所谓“改革”经济的措施——编者），证实了中国共产党领导人所进行的有力揭露的无可辩驳的真实性。”
    文章指出，“没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义者只不过是国际资产阶级的代理人和工具。”所谓“‘全面（建设）共产主义’，是拙劣的骗局和可耻的背叛。”
    文章最后说，“苏联人民终将负起自己的使命，把各式各样的赫鲁晓夫分子抛到一边。”
