    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th Dispatch: French President De Gaulle and US President Johnson are engaged in a sharp struggle over the control of US troops and bases in France.
    White House Press Secretary Moyers confirmed on the 8th that French President De Gaulle had written to US President Johnson, "talking about some actions (related to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) that France intends to take."
    This is the first concrete action taken by De Gaulle since he stated at a press conference on February 21 that foreign bases and troops on French territory would be placed under the jurisdiction of the French authorities, targeting the bases and facilities maintained by the United States in France under the name of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as the approximately 30,000 US troops stationed there.
    De Gaulle's letter was delivered to US Ambassador Bohlen on the afternoon of the 7th by French Foreign Minister De Murville. Moyers said that after receiving De Gaulle's letter, Johnson held talks with Secretary of State Rusk, Under Secretary of State Ball, and Secretary of Defense McNamara, and then immediately sent a reply.
    According to The Washington Post, Johnson's response to De Gaulle's suggestion was a straightforward "no." The American press also believes that Johnson's quick response indicates that France's letter was expected.
    News also revealed that Johnson refused to hold bilateral talks with France on the issue of US bases and troops in France, using the excuse that this needed to be discussed among all member states of the North Atlantic Group, in order to incite other member states to exert pressure on France. US State Department spokesman McCloskey said that De Gaulle's proposal to determine France's sovereignty over the bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization within France affected the entire North Atlantic Group, so it should be discussed with other member states. US representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Cleveland, had already promoted to representatives of other member states at the weekly regular meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in Paris on the 9th that the status of US troops stationed in France "is not only related to the United States, but also to the entire alliance." The Associated Press reported that "intense inter-allied consultations" were also underway, and consideration was being given to convening a special ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss the issue. On the other hand, French government spokesman Yvon Bourges announced after a cabinet meeting on the 9th that France believes that it is impossible to have an effective discussion on the effective reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and therefore France is prepared to unilaterally take the measures it deems necessary to restore French sovereignty. He also said that France is prepared to submit detailed notes to the member states of the North Atlantic Group on this matter.
    French newspapers welcomed De Gaulle's actions. Le Echo said: "The major move that will lead to France's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has begun." L'Aurore wrote: "The withdrawal of American troops stationed in France is the beginning of Paris's complete disengagement from the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    戴高乐向美国在西欧的霸权提出严重挑战
    要求管辖美国在法国的三万军队和军事基地
    约翰逊慌忙召集左右商讨对策企图抵制法国的要求
    新华社九日讯  华盛顿消息：法国总统戴高乐和美国总统约翰逊正就法国境内的美国军队和基地的控制权问题展开尖锐的斗争。
    白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯八日证实，法国总统戴高乐已经写信给美国总统约翰逊，“谈到法国打算采取的（同北大西洋公约组织有关的）一些行动”。
    这是戴高乐在二月二十一日的记者招待会上表示要把法国领土上的外国基地和部队收归法国当局管辖以来采取的第一个具体行动，矛头针对美国在北大西洋公约组织名义下在法国保有的基地和设施以及驻扎在那里的大约三万名美军。
    戴高乐的信是由法国外交部长德姆维尔在七日下午交给美国大使波伦的。莫耶斯说，约翰逊接到戴高乐的信后，就同国务卿腊斯克、副国务卿鲍尔和国防部长麦克纳马拉举行了会谈，并且随即送出了复信。
    据《华盛顿邮报》报道，约翰逊对戴高乐建议的答复是一个直截了当的“不”字。美国报界还认为，约翰逊答复得这样快说明，法国的信早就在预料之中。
    消息还透露，约翰逊拒绝就法国境内的美国基地和军队问题同法国举行双边会谈，借口是这需要在北大西洋集团所有成员国中讨论，以便煽动其他成员国对法国施加压力。美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基说，戴高乐要确定法国对北大西洋公约组织在法国境内基地的主权的建议影响到整个北大西洋集团，因此，要同其他成员国商议。美国驻北大西洋公约组织代表克利夫兰九日已经在巴黎北大西洋集团理事会的每周例会上向其他成员国代表宣传，驻法美军的地位问题“不仅关系到美国，而且同整个联盟有关”。美联社报道，同时还在进行“紧张的盟国间的磋商”和考虑召开北大西洋公约组织特别部长会议来讨论这个问题。另一方面，法国政府发言人伊冯·布歇在九日的一次内阁会议后宣布，法国认为，不可能就有效的改组北大西洋公约组织进行有效的讨论，因此法国准备单方面采取它认为必要的措施来恢复法国的主权。他还说，法国准备就此向北大西洋集团各成员国递交详细的照会。
    法国的报纸欢迎戴高乐采取的行动。《回声报》说：“将导致法国退出北大西洋公约组织的重大举动已经开始了。”《震旦报》写道：“美国驻法国的部队走向撤退，这是巴黎对美国和北大西洋公约组织完全脱身过程的开端。”（附图片）
