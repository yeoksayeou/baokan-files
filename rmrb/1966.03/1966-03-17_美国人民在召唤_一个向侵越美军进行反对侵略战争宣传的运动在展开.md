    Editor's Note: The American people are expanding the movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam to the American aggressive forces in South Vietnam. This is a very important development in the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    More than 20 years ago, when the anti-fascist war was being waged, Comrade Mao Zedong, when talking about the Japanese and German people who should resolutely oppose the aggressive wars waged by their own reactionaries, pointed out: "To defeat the war of the Japanese aggressors and Hitler by all means is in the interests of the Japanese and German people; the more thorough the defeat, the better." He said, "This is because the war of the Japanese aggressors and Hitler not only harms the people of the world, but also harms their own people." Today, the war of aggression against Vietnam is also the same for the American people. It is completely correct for the American people to try their best to mobilize the American soldiers invading Vietnam to refuse to fight and oppose the war. It is completely in line with the interests of the American people. They show true patriotism and internationalism.
    The vast majority of American soldiers invading Vietnam were deceived by the American ruling authorities to go to the South Vietnamese battlefield as cannon fodder. The far-sighted American people reveal the truth to them through various channels, explain the principles, and point out the direction, which will inevitably play a role in awakening them, so that the movement of refusing to fight and opposing the war will gradually develop among the American troops invading Vietnam, echoing the increasingly expanding movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam in the United States, becoming a powerful obstacle to the American ruling group's insistence on the war of aggression against Vietnam, and accelerating the complete defeat of American imperialism.
    This newspaper's comprehensive report: As American imperialism intensifies its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam by increasing its troops, the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam is developing more rapidly. One of the important characteristics is that the American people are taking various methods to directly carry out propaganda to the American army, calling on them to refuse to participate in the heinous war of aggression.
    Distributing leaflets against the war of aggression against Vietnam to the front lines
    Since last November, officers and soldiers of the Third Marine Division, Naval Construction Battalions, First Infantry Division, and 173rd Airborne Brigade of the American troops invading Vietnam have successively received a large number of anti-war leaflets sent from their home country. These leaflets advocated that the United States "stop the Vietnam War" and that "American troops withdraw from Vietnam," and encouraged American officers and soldiers to refuse to fight and go on strike, "let the Vietnamese people choose their own government." These leaflets were vivid in material selection, diverse in form, and sincere and inflammatory in tone. Some leaflets were named after the "Vietnam Day Committee" (an employee of the committee claimed that they had printed 30,000 copies of leaflets calling on soldiers to oppose the war), and some leaflets were not named, but sent from various states in the United States. Some were signed by individuals and had a mailing address attached. Many leaflets were sent directly to the soldiers themselves. In January of this year, more and more American soldiers invading Vietnam received such leaflets. Many soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade received such leaflets every day. On the night of January 2, airplanes were also found flying over the Long Beach Naval Base in California, distributing leaflets to the base, and many leaflets fell on the warships docked at the base. In June last year, the "Non-Violent Action Committee" also sent people to the Pentagon to distribute leaflets and give anti-war speeches in the corridors, calling on the staff of the Department of Defense to oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam by resigning.
    Calling on military family members to call on their husbands and sons to withdraw from the war of aggression against Vietnam
    Recently, many family members of American troops invading Vietnam in the country have also received anonymous phone calls and letters from the American people. The general content of these phone calls and letters is to condemn the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam, calling on the family members of American soldiers to call on their husbands and sons to oppose and withdraw from the Vietnam War, saying, "Why should your son sacrifice in vain?" "Why don't we withdraw from Asia so that your husband can come back?" The wife of an army major received phone calls from several people saying that her husband had "fallen into the mire of sin" for participating in the "heinous Vietnam War."
    Blocking troop trains and carrying out propaganda to the American army
    In August last year, in Berkeley, California, under the auspices of the American youth anti-war organization "Vietnam Day Committee," demonstrations and propaganda were carried out to block troop trains for four consecutive times in one month. The soldiers on the train were all transferred to South Vietnam to fight. The number of participants in the demonstrations was 500 at one time, one-third of whom were women, and some even brought children. At the risk of their lives, some people lay on the tracks, forcing the train to reduce its speed, while others jumped on the train, grabbing the train with one hand and holding up anti-war signs with the other, and carrying out propaganda to the soldiers. Some also distributed leaflets to the train. Several hundred other people stood on the side of the road holding anti-war signs. These actions were deeply supported and sympathized with by the American soldiers on the train. Many soldiers smiled and waved to them. Some even made temporary signs and held them out of the window, saying, "We support you," "We are with you, keep up the good work." In December last year, some American youths also broke into San Francisco International Airport and talked to soldiers who were about to take a plane to South Vietnam, and carried out face-to-face anti-war propaganda.
    Supporting American officers and soldiers in opposing the war of aggression against Vietnam
    Last year, many officers and soldiers of the American troops invading Vietnam refused to fight and opposed the war of aggression, and were expelled and persecuted by the American military authorities. In addition to publicizing these events, some events were directly supported and supported by the American people and anti-war organizations. Some held "sympathy demonstrations" of dozens of people for the persecuted soldiers. Some organized committees to protect the persecuted soldiers, held meetings to study countermeasures, and provided free defense lawyers. Some also strived to have the expelled anti-war soldiers publish speeches in newspapers to expose the injustice of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the atrocities of the American army in Vietnam. Some active-duty soldiers even directly participated in the ranks of anti-war parades. Recently, Duncan, a retired former sergeant major of the American army, publicized the crimes of the American war of aggression against Vietnam to thousands of listeners in New York.
    Propaganda has an impact, and the American military authorities are very uneasy
    Although the American people's anti-war propaganda campaign against the American army has just begun and is not very widespread, it has caused a relatively large response within the American army invading Vietnam. In particular, sending leaflets and making phone calls made the American military authorities very uneasy. In December last year, when Democratic Senator McGovern "visited" South Vietnam and had lunch with the commander of the Third Marine Division, Major General Walter, Walter took out an anti-war leaflet from his pocket, read it to him, and expressed "extreme anger." Many American soldiers invading Vietnam have already been affected by this propaganda. A soldier of the 173rd Airborne Brigade said that these leaflets did "have an impact on some soldiers," "they feel what is the point of fighting here," "since no one at home cares about (this war), why bother?" In June last year, twenty American soldiers invading Vietnam jointly wrote a letter to an anti-war organization, expressing their approval of the anti-war publication it published, saying, "Everything you wrote in the publication about Vietnam is true." These soldiers also exposed the atrocities of the American army in South Vietnam in the letter. In addition, many officers and soldiers felt "anger," "surprise," "worry," and "pain" about various atrocities. Colonel Clay, the chief advisor to the First Military Region of the Vietnamese puppet army, said: "This is the third war I have participated in. I recall that this kind of thing has never happened in the past... If this continues, we will have problems." An army major worriedly said: "They will soon throw stones at our (returning) wounded soldiers, just like the French in the war in Indochina."
    The ruling group is very annoyed but helpless
    This practice of the American people has aroused the "serious concern" of the American ruling group. The U.S. Department of Justice is studying and brewing to persecute these organizations that send leaflets for violating the "Anti-Insurrection Act." The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking for people who send letters and make phone calls. Some members of the U.S. Congress have proposed to sentence those who make phone calls to 15 years in prison and a fine of 10,000 U.S. dollars. The American troops invading Vietnam have also strengthened the inspection of mail. The 173rd Airborne Brigade reviews every anonymous letter through the brigade's "Propaganda and Education Office." However, some American troops invading Vietnam admitted that it is actually impossible to review the large number of letters from the United States every day, and it will arouse the opposition of the vast number of soldiers. U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation "authorities" also said that it is "extremely difficult" to find people who make phone calls, and even the people who receive the phone calls do not know whether the phone calls are from local or foreign places.
    The American people's anti-war propaganda campaign against the American army and their families is continuing. No matter what means the Johnson government takes, it cannot be stopped.

### 美国人民在召唤  一个向侵越美军进行反对侵略战争宣传的运动在展开

    美国人民在召唤
    一个向侵越美军进行反对侵略战争宣传的运动在展开
    编者按：美国人民正在把反对侵越战争的运动扩大到在南越的美国侵略军队中去，这是美国人民反对侵越战争运动的一个很重要的发展。
    在二十多年前反法西斯战争在进行的时候，毛泽东同志谈到日本和德国人民应当坚决反对本国反动派进行的侵略战争时曾经指出：“用一切方法使日本侵略者和希特勒的战争归于失败，就是日本人民和德国人民的利益；失败得越彻底，就越好。”他说：“这是因为日本侵略者和希特勒的战争，不但是损害世界人民的，也是损害其本国人民的。”今天，侵越战争对于美国人民来说也是如此。美国人民想尽方法动员侵越美军士兵拒战反战，这种做法是完全正确的，是完全符合美国人民利益的，他们表现了真正的爱国主义和国际主义。
    绝大部分侵越美军士兵，是被美国统治当局骗到南越战场上去当炮灰的。先知先觉的美国人民通过各种途径向他们揭露真相、说明道理、指出方向，就必然会对他们发生警醒的作用，使得拒战和反战的运动在侵越美军当中逐渐发展起来，与美国国内日益扩大的反对侵越战争运动互相呼应，成为美国统治集团坚持侵越战争的强大阻力，加速美帝国主义的彻底失败。
    本报综合报道　随着美帝国主义大量增兵加紧扩大侵越战争，美国人民反对侵越战争的运动更加迅猛地发展起来。其中一个重要的特点，就是美国人民采取多种方式，直接向美军展开宣传，号召他们拒绝参加罪恶的侵略战争。
  向前线散发反对侵越战争的传单
    去年十一月以来，侵越美军海军陆战队第三师、海军工兵、第一步兵师和第一七三空降旅等部队官兵，先后接到大量从国内寄来的反战传单。这些传单主张美国“停止越南战争”，“美军撤出越南”，鼓动美军官兵拒战罢战，“让越南人民自己选择自己的政府”。这些传单选材生动，形式多样，语气诚恳而且富有煽动性。有些传单具名是“越南日委员会”（该委员会的一名工作人员宣称，他们曾编印了三万份号召军人反战的传单），有的传单没有具名，寄自美国各州。有的由个人具名，并附有通讯地址。许多传单都是直接寄给士兵本人的。今年一月间，侵越美军收到这种传单的人越来越多，第一七三空降旅有许多士兵每天接到这种传单。一月二日夜间，美国加利福尼亚州长滩海军基地上空，还发现有飞机向该基地散发传单，许多传单落在停泊在该基地的军舰上。去年六月，“非暴力行动委员会”还派人到五角大楼去散发传单，在楼内走廊上作反战讲演，号召国防部的工作人员用辞职来反对侵越战争。
    号召军属呼夫唤子脱离侵越战争
    最近，侵越美军在国内的许多家属也纷纷接到美国人民的匿名电话和匿名信件。这些电话和信件的一般内容是谴责约翰逊政府的侵越政策，号召美军家属呼夫唤子，反对和脱离越南战争，其中说：“为什么你的儿子要无谓牺牲？”“为什么我们不从亚洲撤退，这样你的丈夫就可以回来了。”有个陆军少校的妻子接到几个人的电话说，她的丈夫由于参加了“罪恶的越南战争，已经掉进了罪恶的泥坑”。
  阻挡运兵火车，向美军进行宣传
    去年八月间，在加利福尼亚州伯克利市，在美国青年反战组织“越南日委员会”的主持下，一月内曾连续进行四次阻挡运兵火车的示威宣传。车上的士兵都是调赴南越作战的。参加示威的人数有一次有五百人，其中三分之一是妇女，有些还带着孩子。他们冒着生命危险，一部分人卧在铁轨上，逼迫火车减低行车速度，一部分人则跳上车去，一手抓住火车，一手高举反战标语牌，向士兵宣传。有的还向车内散发传单。另有几百人则手持反战标语牌，站立在路边。这些行动深深得到车上美军士兵的支持和同情。许多士兵向他们微笑招手。有些还临时作了标语牌，举到窗外，说：“我们支持你”，“我们与你们在一起，把这件好事继续进行下去。”去年十二月间，有的美国青年还闯进旧金山国际机场，与即将搭机开赴南越的士兵谈话，进行面对面的反战宣传。
    支持美军官兵反对侵越战争事件
    去年，侵越美军有许多官兵拒绝作战，反对侵略战争，遭到美军当局的开除和迫害。对这些事件，美国进步报刊除了广为宣传外，有些事件还直接得到美国人民和反战组织的支持和声援。有的为受迫害军人举行了数十人的“同情示威”。有的组织了保卫受迫害军人的委员会，开会研究对策，免费提供辩护律师。有的还争取被开除的反战军人在报上发表谈话，揭露侵越战争的非正义性和美军在越南的暴行。有些现役军人还直接参加了反战游行的行列。最近，退伍的美军前军士长邓肯在纽约向成千听众宣传美国侵越战争的罪恶。
  宣传产生影响，美军当局很不安
    美国人民对美军开展的反战宣传虽然还刚刚开始，规模也不十分广泛，但在侵越美军内部已引起较大的反响。特别是寄传单、打电话，使美军当局十分不安。去年十二月间，当民主党参议员麦克戈文“访问”南越，与海军陆战队第三师师长、少将华尔特共进午餐时，华尔特就从口袋里掏出一张反战传单，念给他听，表现“十分震怒”。有许多侵越美军士兵则已经受到这些宣传的影响。第一七三空降旅一个士兵说，这些传单对“有些士兵确实发生了影响”，“他们觉得（在这里打仗）到底有什么意思”，“既然国内没有人关心（这一战争），他们又何苦来呢？”去年六月，有二十个侵越美军士兵联合写信给一个反战组织，对它出版的反战刊物表示赞同，说：“你们在刊物上写的每一件关于越南的事情都是真实的。”这些士兵还在信中揭露了美军在南越的暴行。另有许多官兵则对种种暴行感到“愤怒”、“惊奇”、“忧虑”、“痛苦”。越南伪军第一军区首席顾问、美军上校克莱说：“这是我参加的第三次战争了，我回忆过去从未发生过这类事情，……假如这样下去，我们会出问题的。”有一名陆军少校担心说：“他们不久就会象法国在印度支那的战争一样，要向我们（回国）的伤兵扔石头了。”
    统治集团大为恼火而又无可奈何
    美国人民的这种做法引起美国统治集团的“严重忧虑”。美国司法部正在研究酝酿对这些寄发传单的组织以违反“反叛乱法令”的罪名予以迫害。美国联邦调查局正查找发信和打电话的人员。美国国会有的议员提出要对打电话的人处以十五年徒刑，一万元美金罚款。侵越美军也加强对邮件的检查工作，第一七三空降旅由该旅的“宣传教育处”审查每一封匿名信件。但是侵越美军有人承认，要审查每天来自美国的大量信件在事实上并不可能，而且会激起广大士兵的反对。美国联邦调查局“权威人士”也说，要查找打电话的人有“极端困难”，甚至接到电话的人也不知道电话是来自本地或外地。
    美国人民向美军及其家属展开的反战宣传运动正在继续开展。约翰逊政府不管采取什么样的手段，都是无法加以遏止的。
