    It's Good That They Come From and Return to the Communes
    Zhao Zhenxing, Principal of Xinhui Agricultural Technical School, Guangdong
    Our school was established in 1958. From the beginning, the county party committee decided that our school would implement a half-farming, half-study system. Students would come from the communes and, upon graduation, return to the communes, cultivating agricultural technical talent for the county who are both educated and capable. Seven years of practice have proven that the "come from the communes, return to the communes" method is excellent.
    
    Graduates Returning to the Communes
    Are Able to Apply What They Learn
    In the past seven years, our school has had 427 graduates. They have returned to the forefront of agricultural production, actively carrying out agricultural technology research and promotion work. The agricultural science research stations and agricultural technology promotion stations in all twenty communes in our county are led by our school's students or staffed by them as technicians. They have all played a significant role in the production teams. According to a survey of 170 graduates in eight communes, 146 have achieved results, large or small, in areas such as planting model fields, promoting improved varieties, and improving soil, and have been praised by the broad masses of commune members and cadres. Many have been named "Five-Good" commune members, "Five-Good" cadres, youth pacesetters, and technical experts, and 27 have achieved significant results in agricultural technology research and promotion work.
    
    Zou Chaogen, a student from Siqian Commune, had been a youth team leader before coming to the agricultural technical school, specifically responsible for transforming the acidic, low-yield fields in his brigade. After two years of work, due to a lack of scientific knowledge, he did not achieve good results. In 1958, he came to our school to study with this problem in mind. During his studies, he paid special attention to researching this issue. After graduating, he returned to the Zou Er production team in his brigade as the team leader, using the knowledge he had learned to transform ten mu of acidic soil, achieving a bumper harvest, with a yield of over 800 jin per mu that year.
    
    Ke Mingfu, a graduate from 1960, actively experimented with planting peanuts after returning to the Lile Commune. Based on the characteristics of the Lile soil—high clay content, low organic matter, and high water table—and with the support of the commune party committee, he adopted methods such as improving the soil, ridge planting, and lowering the water table. After three years of experiments, he achieved a yield of 416 jin of peanuts per mu. In the past, peanuts here only produced 60-70 jin per mu, and farmers believed that the soil was not suitable for growing peanuts. After Ke Mingfu successfully improved the soil and experimented with planting peanuts, he changed the farmers' views and promoted the large-scale planting of peanuts throughout the commune. This year, Siqian Commune planted 20,000 mu of early rice pearl millet, achieving significant yield increases. The improved variety of pearl millet was mainly cultivated by graduate He You in 1963, starting with five jin of seeds and several rounds of breeding.
    
    After returning to their teams, our school's students actively took on the task of agricultural technology propaganda and guidance, helping various production teams solve some agricultural technical problems.
    
    The students who returned to the communes not only played the role of technicians, but also ordinary laborers, working like commune members. According to a survey of fourteen graduates from Yaoxi Commune, in 1964, these students all worked more than 250 labor days throughout the year, with the highest reaching 480 days. The average labor days were equivalent to the level of a Grade 1 laborer. They are truly new-type peasants who are both educated and capable, and they have initially established a new style of work.
    
    Implementing "Come From the Communes, Return to the Communes"
    Is a Battle of Ideological Revolution
    Implementing the half-farming, half-study system, "come from the communes, return to the communes," is a battle of ideological revolution. When we first started implementing "come from the communes, return to the communes," we encountered considerable ideological resistance. A few teachers believed that the students sent by the communes had uneven levels of education, making it difficult to teach them well. In response to this thinking, the school party branch helped teachers comprehensively analyze the students' strengths and weaknesses, and called on teachers to work alongside students. Through labor, teachers realized that although some of these students had lower levels of education, most of them were children of poor and lower-middle peasants, with good political thought, strong labor perspectives, clear class viewpoints, and a high degree of self-awareness in their studies, making rapid progress.
    
    Students come from the communes, but will they return to the communes? At the beginning, many teachers, parents, and students had varying degrees of resistance in their minds. They believed, "You don't need to study to farm, so why go to agricultural school?" and "Sooner or later, you'll be using a hoe, so sooner is better than later." Some teachers and staff also held the outdated notion that "those who excel in study become officials," believing that letting students return to the communes was "unfair to the students and unfair to the parents," feeling "guilty." Some advocated dividing students into two types: those with good grades would become cadres after graduation, and those with poor grades would become commune members. At that time, the school party branch launched a major debate among teachers and students in response to these ideas. The questions for debate were: "Do farmers need scientific knowledge?" "Does the countryside need technical personnel?" "Is it a waste of talent to go back to be a farmer?" At the same time, teachers and students were organized to go to the countryside to listen to the opinions and demands of commune cadres and members. Cadres and members raised many technical issues and asked the school's teachers and students to help solve them. The school also invited Zhou Hanhua and Yuan Shizhang, advanced educated youths from the countryside, to give reports at the school. Through these efforts, the ideological awareness of teachers and students was raised. After 1960, graduates of our school also made some achievements in the countryside and received praise from the masses and cadres. These facts educated students, parents, and teachers, and changed their views. Before 1960, agricultural schools often did not have enough enrollments. After 1960, more and more students applied to agricultural technical schools. In 1963, the number of students applying to agricultural schools was four times greater than the planned enrollment.
    
    All of the School's Work is
    Adapted to "Come From the Communes, Return to the Communes"
    Half-farming and half-study, "come from the communes, return to the communes," requires the school to adapt a series of tasks to it.
    
    In addition to grasping class education, the school's ideological and political work also focuses on educating students to "take pride in agriculture and find joy in agriculture." The first step is to study Chairman Mao's works, such as "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Serve the People," to help students gradually establish a revolutionary worldview. The second is to focus on students' production labor training, as well as paying attention to cultivating pacesetters among graduates and organizing them to return to the school to give reports, introducing the achievements they have made in agricultural production.
    
    In addition to regular political education, the school also pays special attention to grasping the education of new students and graduates. When students enter the school, we explain the nature and tasks of the school to the students, that the school cultivates new-type peasants, and that students come from the communes and will return to the communes to work after graduation. After enrollment, the first two weeks are mainly spent participating in production labor. In response to the students' active thoughts, we organize the study of Chairman Mao's works, conducting education on the importance of the future and agricultural production in the national economy. When students are about to graduate, we conduct another round of intensive education, in addition to the above content, specifically discussing "whether or not to go to the grassroots level," "whether or not they are willing to go to the most difficult places," "how to carry out work after returning," and so on.
    
    School education must also be coordinated with commune education. Before students enroll, commune cadres conduct an education for the students, explaining the learning tasks. Each semester, the school sends the students' grade reports to the students' parents and also to the commune cadres. Each academic year, students spend three to four months going to the communes to conduct surveys, visit, intern, and labor, in order to understand the needs of agricultural production, strengthen ties with the communes, and enhance their feelings for the peasants. After students graduate and return to the communes, the school strengthens ties with graduates, using the agricultural science and technology stations in each commune as a base. The school often sends teachers down to understand their problems and help them solve them as much as possible. The school also holds graduate representative meetings from time to time, commending advanced individuals, exchanging experiences, and studying problems.
    
    Professional courses are set up according to the production needs of the communes in the county. There cannot be too many, because if there are too many, they cannot be "specialized"; but there cannot be too few, because if there are too few, students will not be able to adapt to the diverse requirements of the countryside. It should be "one specialty with multiple skills." According to the principle of "commune needs, local focus," we have compiled the textbooks for professional courses. In accordance with the spirit of "On Practice," we emphasize on-site teaching and emphasize teaching in conjunction with the production season. We implement the three-way combination of teachers, experienced farmers, and students, teaching and learning from each other. We often invite local experts to teach at the school, and sometimes take students to production units to learn from experienced farmers, enriching students' practical knowledge.
    
    Production experiments and scientific research must also meet local needs. The county party committee designated our school as a base for cultivating improved rice varieties. Therefore, our main research and experimental projects are cultivating improved varieties, followed by plant protection and fertilizer experiments. In recent years, our school has cultivated improved rice varieties such as "Xin Nong Xuan" No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 23, supporting the communes with nearly 100,000 jin of improved varieties. In particular, the early-maturing rice variety "Xin Nong Xuan 23," which has a high yield, has been decided by the county party committee to be promoted throughout the county.
    
    In order to meet the needs of the communes, we also run various short-term training classes to cultivate the talents urgently needed by the communes. In the past seven years, the school has cooperated with various departments to run various training classes for animal husbandry, plant protection, breeding, accounting, farm implement technicians, agricultural middle school teachers, etc., totaling 1,289 people, powerfully supporting various communes and developing agricultural production.

    社来社去好
    广东新会农业技术学校校长  赵振兴
    我们学校是一九五八年办起来的。学校从开办时起，县委就决定我校实行半农半读，学生从社队来，毕业后回社队去，为本县培养能文能武的农业技术人材。七年来的实践证明，社队来社队去的办法好得很。
    毕业生回到社队
    能够学以致用
    七年来，我校已有四百二十七名毕业生。他们回到农业生产第一线，积极开展了农业技术研究和推广工作。我们全县二十个公社的农业科学研究站和农业技术推广站，都由我校的学生担任了领导工作或作了技术员。他们都在生产队中起了显著的作用。根据八个公社一百七十名毕业生的调查，有一百四十六人在种样板田、推广良种、改良土壤等方面，取得了或大或小的成绩，受到广大社员和干部的赞扬。有不少人被评为五好社员、五好干部、青年标兵和技术能手，有二十七人在农业技术研究和推广工作方面取得了显著成绩。
    司前公社学生邹朝根未到农业技术学校以前，当过青年队长，专门负责改造本大队的酸性低产田。搞了两年，由于缺乏科学知识，没有取得好的效果。一九五八年他带着这个问题来我校学习，在学习期间，他特别注意对这个问题的研究。毕业以后，他回到本大队的邹二生产队当队长，运用学到的知识改造了这个队的十亩酸性田，获得了大丰收，当年亩产就达到八百多斤。
    一九六○年毕业的学生柯明福，回到礼乐公社后，积极试种花生。他根据礼乐土壤粘性大，有机质少，地下水位高的特点，在公社党委支持下，他采取改良土壤，起畦穴播，降低地下水位等办法，经过三年试验，使每亩花生达到四百一十六斤。过去，这里的花生每亩只产六七十斤，农民认为这里的土壤不适宜种花生。柯明福改良土壤，试种花生成功后，改变了农民的看法，推动了全社大种花生。今年，司前公社种了二万亩早稻珍珠矮，获得了显著的增产。珍珠矮这个良种，主要是由毕业生何有在一九六三年用五斤种子经过几次繁育而培育起来的。
    我校的学生回队后，积极担负起了农业技术的宣传和辅导工作，帮助各生产队解决了一些农业技术问题。
    回到社队的学生，不仅起了技术员的作用，而且又是普通劳动者，和社员一样劳动。根据崖西公社十四个毕业生的调查，一九六四年，这些学生全年所做的劳动日都在二百五十个以上，最高的达四百八十个，平均劳动日相当于一级劳动力的水平，他们真正是能文能武的新型农民，初步树立了新的风尚。
    实行社来社去
    是场思想革命
    实行半农半读，社队来社队去，是一场思想革命。开始实行社队来社队去的时候，我们曾经遇到不少思想阻力。少数教师认为社队保送来的学生，文化程度参差不齐，难以教好。针对这种思想，学校党支部帮助教师全面分析了学生的优缺点，并号召教师与学生同劳动。通过劳动，使教师认识到这些学生虽然有的文化程度低一些，但是他们绝大部分是贫下中农子弟，政治思想好，劳动观点强，阶级观点明确，学习的自觉性高，进步很快。
    学生从社队来，但是否回社队去？开始时，不少教师、家长和学生，思想上都有不同程度的抵触，他们认为“耕田不用学，何必读农校”，“迟早都是拿锄头，迟拿不如早拿”。有的教师和职工也存在着“学而优则仕”的陈腐观念，认为让学生再回社队是“对不起学生，对不起家长”，感到“理亏”。有的主张将学生分为两种，成绩好的毕业后当干部，不好的当社员。当时，学校党支部针对这些思想，曾经在师生中开展了大辩论。辩论的问题是：“当农民要不要科学知识”、“农村需要不需要技术人员”、“回去当农民是不是浪费人材”？同时，还组织师生下乡，听取社队干部、社员的意见和要求。干部和社员提出很多技术问题，要求学校的师生帮助解决。学校还请农村的先进知识青年周汉华、袁仕章来校作报告。通过这些工作，提高了师生的思想觉悟。到一九六○年以后，本校的毕业生在农村也做出一些成绩，受到了群众、干部的赞扬。这些事实教育了学生、家长和教师，改变了他们的看法。一九六○年以前，农业学校招生经常名额不足，一九六○年以后，报考农业技术学校的学生就越来越多了，一九六三年报考农业学校的学生比计划招生数多了四倍。
  学校的一切工作与
    社来社去相适应
    半农半读、社来社去，就要求学校把一系列的工作同它相适应。
    学校的思想政治工作，除了抓阶级教育以外，还着重向学生进行“以农为荣，以农为乐”的教育。首先是学习毛主席著作，如《青年运动的方向》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》等文章，帮助学生逐步树立革命的世界观。再就是抓学生的生产劳动锻炼，以及注意在毕业生中培养标兵，组织他们回校作报告，介绍他们在农业生产上做出的成绩。
    学校除了经常性的政治教育以外，还特别注意抓新生入学和毕业生的教育。学生入学时，我们就向学生说明学校的性质和任务，学校是培养新型农民，学生由社队来，毕业后仍然回到社队去劳动。入学后，头两星期主要是参加生产劳动，针对学生的活思想，组织学习毛主席著作，向学生进行前途教育和农业生产在国民经济中的重要性的教育。学生快毕业的时候，再集中进行一次教育，除上述内容外，还具体讨论“要不要到基层去”，“愿不愿到最艰苦的地方去”，“回去如何开展工作”，等等。
    学校教育还要和社队教育相配合。学生在入学前，由社队干部向学生进行一次教育，交代学习任务。学校在每学期都把学生的成绩报告书，发给学生家长，也发给社队干部。每一学年，学生都有三到四个月下社队去调查访问、实习和劳动，以了解农业生产上的需要，加强和社队的联系，增强同农民的感情。学生毕业回社队后，学校又以各公社的农业科技站为基点，加强和毕业生的联系。学校经常派教师下去了解他们的问题，并尽可能帮助他们解决。学校还不定期地召开毕业生代表会议，表扬先进，交流经验，研究问题。
    专业课程是根据本县社队的生产需要设置的，不能太多，太多了，就不能做到“专”；但又不能太少，太少了，学生就不能适应农村的多种要求，应该是“一专多能”。根据“社队需要，本地为主”的原则，我们编写了专业课的教材。按照《实践论》精神，强调现场教学，强调结合生产季节进行教学。实行教师、老农、学生三结合，互教互学，常请一些土专家来校上课，也有时带学生去生产单位向老农请教，丰富学生的实际知识。
    生产试验、科学研究也要符合本地需要。县委指定我校为水稻良种培育基地。因此，我们的主要研究试验项目是培育良种，其次是植物保护和肥料试验。几年来，我校培育了“新农选”1号、2号、3号、4号、23号等水稻良种，支援了社队良种近十万斤。特别是早造早熟水稻品种“新农选23号”，产量高，县委已决定在全县推广。
    为了满足社队的需要，我们还开办了各种短期训练班，培养社队急需的人材。七年来，学校和各部门配合，开办了畜牧、植保、育种、会计、农具手、农业中学教师等各种训练班，共培养了一千二百八十九人，有力地支援了各社队，发展农业生产。（附图片）
