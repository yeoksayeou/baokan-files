    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Telegram: According to the Vietnam News Agency, since the beginning of this year, the political struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the "pacification" plan of the American bandits and their running dogs has been vigorously developing. In January and February alone, more than 700,000 people rose up to fight face-to-face with the US-puppet clique.

    The report said that in the southern central region alone, the number of people participating in the struggle in January reached 112,000. In Bến Tre Province, the number of people participating in the struggle in January was 40,000, while in the first 20 days of February, the number of people participating in the struggle increased to more than 240,000.

    The report said that since the beginning of this year, while carrying out large-scale "mopping-up" operations, the American bandits and their running dogs have also inhumanly implemented the "three alls" policy of kill all, burn all, and destroy all. However, these bloody crimes of the American aggressors have further aroused the hatred of the South Vietnamese people towards them. While the South Vietnamese army and people are fiercely attacking the enemy militarily, the rural people have launched an increasingly fierce and widespread political struggle, making the enemy increasingly passive.

    The report said that the rural people in various parts of South Vietnam are determined to further advance this struggle movement on the basis of the victories already achieved, and to crush the US-puppet clique's plan to "pacify the countryside."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Telegram: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, workers and students in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam have launched strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations in the first two months of this year, opposing the heinous actions of the American aggressors and their running dogs in intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam, stepping up the exploitation of the working people, and intensifying conscription.

    According to reports, in Saigon, Gia Định, Biên Hòa, Rạch Giá, Cà Mau, Cam Ranh Bay, Đắk Lắk, Chu Lai and other places, more than 50,000 workers and laborers have carried out strikes, demonstrations and other struggles, demanding increased wages, improved working conditions, lower prices, and an end to the dismissal of workers.

    At the same time, the people of Saigon, Rạch Giá and other places carried out struggles against the American aggressors and their running dogs' forced relocation, burning of houses, and seizure of land. Many students in the enemy-occupied cities also held rallies, demonstrations, class boycotts, and other struggles, opposing the US-puppet clique's forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression.

    Workers at the Vĩnh Long, Cam Ranh Bay, Chu Lai and other airports also held many go-slows and strikes. In Rạch Giá and Cà Mau, when peasants poured into the cities to stage demonstrations, urban workers and laborers also held various struggles to cooperate with them.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Telegram: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in February, hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life in the South Vietnamese provinces of Bến Tre, Mỹ Tho, Thủ Dầu Một, Châu Đốc, Cà Mau and other provinces successively held many large-scale rallies and demonstrations, strongly protesting and denouncing the towering crimes committed by US imperialism and its running dogs against the Vietnamese people.

    In Bến Tre Province alone, in the first twenty days of February, more than 200,000 people successively held hundreds of rallies and demonstrations, strongly protesting the barbaric crimes of the US-puppet clique in massacring innocent people, demanding that they compensate the victims for their losses, and demanding that US imperialism get out of South Vietnam.

    The people of Thủ Dầu Một, Châu Đốc, and Mỹ Tho provinces also repeatedly carried the bodies of their compatriots killed by the enemy and the destroyed utensils, and launched face-to-face struggles with the enemy, demanding compensation for losses. Nearly 10,000 people from various villages in Cái Bè District, Mỹ Tho Province participated in the struggle.

    The people of Long Xuyên, Châu Đốc, Cà Mau and other cities also launched fierce struggles with the enemy. Especially in Cà Mau City, struggles broke out successively on February 20, 22 and 23, with more than 1,000 to 2,000 people participating each time. On the 23rd, more than 2,000 farmers and citizens held demonstrations, shouting slogans against the US-puppet clique's persecution of the people. The demonstration lasted from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. that day.

    新华社河内电  据越南通讯社报道，今年以来，越南南方人民反对美国强盗及其走狗“绥靖”计划的政治斗争蓬勃发展，在一月份和二月份里，就有七十多万人次起来同美伪集团进行了面对面的斗争。

    报道说，今年以来，美国强盗及其走狗在进行大规模“扫荡”的同时，还灭绝人性地实行杀光、烧光、毁光的
  “三光”政策。但是，美国侵略者的这些血腥罪行，更加激起了越南南方人民对他们的仇恨。越南南方军民在军事上猛烈打击敌人的同时，农村人民展开了愈来愈猛烈和广泛的政治斗争，使敌人愈来愈陷于被动。
    报道说，越南南方各地农村人民决心在已经取得的胜利的基础上，进一步推进这个斗争运动，粉碎美伪集团的“绥靖农村”的计划。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方敌占区工人、学生在今年头两个月中，纷纷举行罢工、罢课和游行示威，反对美国侵略者及其走狗加强侵越战争，加紧剥削劳动人民和抓兵等罪恶行动。
    据报道，在西贡、嘉定、边和、迪石、金瓯、金兰湾、多乐、朱莱等地，已有五万多工人和劳动者进行了罢工、示威等斗争，要求增加工资，改善劳动条件，降低物价，停止解雇工人等。
    同时，西贡、迪石等地的人民进行了反对美国侵略者及其走狗迫迁、烧毁房屋和霸占土地的斗争。很多敌占城市内的学生也纷纷举行集会、游行示威、罢课等斗争，反对美伪集团强迫他们为美国侵略战争充当炮灰。
    永隆、金兰湾、朱莱等机场的工人也举行了多次怠工和罢工。在迪石和金瓯，当农民涌进城市进行示威游行的时候，城市工人和劳动者也举行各种斗争配合他们。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：在二月份，越南南方槟椥、美萩、土龙木、朱笃、金瓯等省数十万各阶层人民相继举行许多次声势浩大的集会和游行示威，强烈抗议和控诉美帝国主义和它的走狗对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行。
    在槟椥省，仅二月份头二十天中就有二十多万人相继举行上百次集会和游行示威，强烈抗议美伪集团残杀无辜人民的野蛮罪行，要求它们赔偿被害者的损失，要求美帝国主义从越南南方滚出去。
    土龙木、朱笃、美萩各省人民也多次抬着被敌人杀害的同胞的尸体和被破坏的用具，同敌人展开面对面的斗争，要求赔偿损失。美萩省丐?县各乡就有近万人参加了斗争。
    龙川、朱笃、金瓯等城市的人民也同敌人展开激烈的斗争。特别是在金瓯市，二月二十、二十二和二十三日三天中接连爆发了斗争，每次都有一千多人到两千人参加。在二十三日，两千多农民和市民举行游行示威，高呼反对美伪集团迫害人民的口号。示威从当天早上八时一直延续到下午三时。
