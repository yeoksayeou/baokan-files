    Recently, the likes of Johnson are vigorously promoting so-called "social reforms" in South Vietnam. American official figures and propaganda machines, as well as the South Vietnamese puppet group, are also clamoring around the so-called South Vietnamese "Rural Construction Program" put forward by Johnson at the Honolulu Conference, shouting that the United States is determined to launch a "war to win the hearts and minds of the people" in South Vietnam. US Vice President Humphrey even said: If we follow the formulated plan of action, then the "victory sought" by the United States will be realized. It seems that this trick of Washington has really become a magic weapon to save the United States from its defeat in South Vietnam.

    Johnson's introduction of the so-called "Rural Construction Program" of "reforming South Vietnamese society" at this time has, first and foremost, the purpose of attempting to deceive public opinion, ease the increasingly strong opposition to the US war of aggression against Vietnam at home and abroad, and make people believe that US imperialism is not the executioner who slaughters the South Vietnamese people, but a philanthropist who cares about the suffering of the South Vietnamese people.

    Johnson's doing this is also intended to consolidate and expand the US aggressors' territory in South Vietnam. The so-called "Rural Construction Program" is essentially a new "appeasement" plan. It aims to "eliminate communists in a region"; dispatch armed secret agents of the Central Intelligence Agency to "investigate communist sympathizers" door-to-door; and then do some "good deeds," from "establishing schools" to "helping" farmers cultivate their land, "in order to restore the government's image among the villagers." In reality, this is using the name of "rural construction" to strengthen control over the people in the occupied areas and consolidate the fascist rule of the US-puppet group. The US ruling group even describes this as something done to "establish a free, independent, strong, and peaceful Vietnam" and to "realize the deepest aspirations of the Vietnamese people." This is truly the height of shamelessness.

    In fact, this is not a new trick. A few years ago, during the Kennedy-Ngo Dinh Diem period, the so-called "Staley Plan" was formulated. At that time, that plan, under the guise of "reform," established the heinous "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam, promoting so-called "industrial development" and "social welfare," which resulted in a shameful failure. No wonder some American bourgeois newspapers cannot help but sigh at Johnson's repeating the same mistake, pointing out that the United States has "bitter experience" in this regard.

    Why does Johnson knowingly commit such an error? This is because US imperialism is at a loss in the vast ocean of the South Vietnamese people's war. In the words of the US magazine *Newsweek*, for the US aggressors, "not one square mile of South Vietnam is truly pacified." The famous American commentator Walter Lippmann used a more vivid analogy, saying, "The Vietnam War is like hitting a bowl full of water with a fist. We can make a hole anywhere in the water with our powerful fist. But once we pull our hand back—perhaps to make another hole in the water—the first hole disappears." The situation is like this: although the US aggressors can occupy some places, they cannot gain a firm foothold, and they are being beaten passively everywhere. Johnson brings out his "appeasement" plan to use political control and deception to cooperate with his military "sweeps" in order to realize his bankrupt so-called "ink blot strategy," consolidate the existing occupied areas, and expand its occupied areas. They attempt to rely on the US aggressor troops on the South Vietnamese battlefield to "provide a shield" for the new plan, so that "real improvements" can be achieved after nine or ten months; and "complete pacification" can be achieved after five or six years. This is, of course, a complete dream.

    First of all, US imperialism faces an insurmountable contradiction. The US magazine *Life* said in its January issue: "We cannot defeat this armed enemy unless we win the people; however, unless we defeat this armed enemy, we cannot win the people." The crux of the matter lies here. Today, although the number of US aggressor troops in South Vietnam has increased to more than 200,000, it has not improved its passive situation of being beaten. The series of "offensives" launched by the US aggressor troops in Vietnam in the past month have failed one after another, indicating that the US aggressors' "sweep" plan will not succeed. The US "reform" trick is to support US military operations, but it must first rely on military operations to pave the way. If this path cannot be paved, then any "appeasement plan" and "rural construction plan" can only become castles in the air.

    Of course, the US aggressors can conduct this kind of "experiment" on the small piece of land that they still occupy. Some American "appeasement experts" are now also seriously selecting some places as so-called "preliminary experimental areas." However, the United States is implementing a brutal policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" in South Vietnam, while at the same time playing the role of a merciful savior. How can this deceive people? The West German weekly *New Politics* put it very sharply: Johnson "and his Saigon henchmen burn villages, destroy crops that have not yet been harvested, and therefore, after the Saigon regime lost nine-tenths of the territory of South Vietnam, they now want to implement 'social reform' there in order to win the war. Isn't this a huge and laughable joke?"

    In the final analysis, the "reforms" and "good deeds" done by US imperialism in South Vietnam are all intended to strengthen the US aggression against South Vietnam and maintain the rule of the tottering Saigon puppet regime. The likes of Johnson are constantly clamoring about "reforming South Vietnamese society," "eliminating" social injustices and corruption, and "winning the hearts and minds of the people." However, US imperialism cannot abandon the utterly corrupt South Vietnamese puppet regime. Johnson publicly declared that "defending" this regime is the obligation of the United States. The US aggressors and their lackeys are in complete opposition to the South Vietnamese people. The vast majority of South Vietnamese people are increasingly aware that only by driving out the US aggressors and overthrowing the traitorous regime can a free, independent, strong, and peaceful Vietnam truly be established. Therefore, no matter how the US-puppet group engages in the so-called "social reform" trick, it will be of no avail.

    刽子手的骗术
    烽林
    最近，约翰逊之流正在大事鼓吹在南越实行什么“社会改革”。美国的官方人物和宣传机器以及南越傀儡集团，也围绕着檀香山会议上约翰逊打出的所谓南越“乡村建设计划”，喧喧嚷嚷，叫喊什么美国决心在南越发动一场
  “争取人民民心的战争”。美国副总统汉弗莱甚至说：如果按照制定的行动计划去做的话，那么，美国“所谋求的胜利就会实现。”好象华盛顿这一花招，真的成了挽救美国在南越一败涂地的处境的一个法宝。
    约翰逊在这个时候端出所谓“改革南越社会”的“乡村建设计划”，首先一个目的，是企图欺骗舆论，缓和美国国内外对其侵越战争政策日益强烈的反对，要使人相信美帝国主义并不是屠杀南越人民的刽子手，而是关切南越人民疾苦的慈善家。
    约翰逊搞这一套，也是为了想要巩固和扩大美国侵略者在南越的地盘。所谓“乡村建设计划”，实质是一个新的“绥靖”计划。它要“在一个地区内肃清共产党人”；派遣中央情报局的武装特务挨户“调查共产党同情分子”；然后办些“好事”，从“兴办学校”到“帮助”农民耕田，“以便恢复政府在村民中的形象”。这实际上是借“乡村建设”之名，加强对占领区人民的控制，巩固美伪集团的法西斯统治。美国统治集团竟然把这一套说成是什么为了“建立一个自由、独立、强大与和平的越南”，要“使越南人民的最深切的愿望得到实现”。这真是无耻之尤。
    其实，这并不是什么新鲜的玩艺儿。几年以前，在肯尼迪—吴庭艳时期，就曾制定过所谓“斯特利计划”。当时，那个计划以“改革”为名，在南越建立万恶的“战略村”，鼓吹进行什么“工业发展”、“社会福利”，结果是遭到了可耻的失败。难怪一些美国资产阶级报刊都不能不对约翰逊的重蹈覆辙发出感叹，指出美国在这方面“有着辛酸的经验”。
    约翰逊何以明知而故犯呢？这是因为美帝国主义在南越人民战争的汪洋大海中一筹莫展。用美国《新闻周刊》的话来说，对于美国侵略者，“南越没有一平方英里的地方是真正平定了的”。美国著名评论员李普曼则作过更形象的比喻，他说：“越南战争就象是用拳头打一满盆水。我们用我们的强有力的拳头在水里的任何地方都可以打一个洞。但是我们一旦把手缩回来——可能是为了在水里打另一个洞——第一个洞就不见了。”事情就是这样的，美国侵略者虽然可以侵占一些地方，但站不住脚跟，处处都是被动挨打。约翰逊搬出他的“绥靖”计划来，是想用政治控制和欺骗配合他的军事“扫荡”，以便实现其已破产了的所谓“墨渍战略”，巩固现有的占领区，并且扩大它的占领区。他们企图依靠南越战场上的美国侵略军为新计划“提供一个盾牌”，以便九、十个月后“取得真正的改善”；五、六年后取得“彻底绥靖”。这当然完全是梦想。
    首先，美帝国主义面临着一个无法克服的矛盾。美国一月号《生活》杂志就这样说：“我们不能打败这个武装的敌人，除非我们赢得人民；然而除非我们打败这个武装的敌人，我们不能赢得人民”。问题的症结正是在这里。今天美国侵略军在南越虽然已增至二十多万，但丝毫未能改善它被动挨打的处境。侵越美军近一月来发动的一系列“攻势”纷纷失败，说明美国侵略者的“扫荡”计划是成功不了的。美国的“改革”把戏是为了支持美国军事行动，但是它首先要靠军事行动来开道。开不出这条道，什么“绥靖计划”、
  “乡村建设计划”，都只能成为空中楼阁。
    当然，美国侵略者可以在它们目前还占领的一小块地盘上进行这种“试验”。一些美国“绥靖专家”现在也煞有介事地在选择一些地方当作什么“初步试验区”。可是，美国一面在南越实行残暴的“杀光、烧光、毁光”政策，同时却又要扮演大慈大悲的救世主，这怎么能骗得了人呢？西德《新政治》周刊说得一针见血：约翰逊“和他的西贡帮凶烧毁村庄、毁坏还没有收割的庄稼，因此西贡政权失去了南越的十分之九的领土以后，现在竟想在那里实行‘社会改革’，借此来取得战争的胜利。这岂不是一个天大的引人发笑不止的笑话。”
    归根结蒂，美帝国主义在越南南方所做的“改革”和“好事”，都是为了加强美国对南越的侵略，维护摇摇欲坠的西贡傀儡的统治。约翰逊之流口口声声叫嚷什么“改革南越社会”，“铲除”社会方面的不正义和腐败，要“争取民心”。但是，美帝国主义却不能抛弃腐败透顶的南越傀儡政权。约翰逊公开声明“保卫”这个政权是美国的义务。美国侵略者和它的走狗已同南越人民处于完全对立的地位。广大的南越人民越来越清楚地认识到，只有赶走美国侵略者，推翻卖国政权，才能够真正建立一个自由、独立、强大与和平的越南。因此，不管美伪集团怎样搞所谓“社会改革”的把戏，都是无济于事的。
