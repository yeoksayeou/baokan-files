Local guerrillas and the Liberation Army concealed themselves in the fortifications of Hoa Thang Commune. After a group of US aggressor troops approached the fortifications, they suddenly launched a fierce counterattack. After two hours of intense fighting, the Liberation Army and guerrillas completely frustrated the enemy's multiple offensives, killing and wounding 405 US aggressor troops.
    On the 4th and 6th, the Liberation Army and guerrillas successively intercepted another group of enemy troops who came to "sweep" and attacked the enemy troops stationed in Phu Yen, eliminating 107 enemies and destroying three artillery pieces.

    On the morning of the 16th, the local troops and guerrillas of the D War Zone, three kilometers northwest of Ban Nang, attacked the camp of a US paratrooper battalion and intercepted another US battalion that came to rescue them. The battle lasted for more than three hours. The Liberation Armed Forces, divided into several routes, went straight into the US military positions, dividing and encircling the US troops to eliminate them one by one.

    On March 14th, the enemy dispatched seven battalions of US and puppet troops, under the cover of many planes, armored vehicles, and artillery, to launch a large-scale "sweep" against the villages along the Dong Vang Co River in Duc Hoa County, Di An Province. The local military and civilians gave the enemy a fierce blow, eliminating more than 150 US aggressor troops, shooting down and damaging three enemy planes, and destroying and damaging eight M-113 amphibious armored vehicles in two battles in Hoa Khanh Commune and Ha Huu Thanh Commune.
