    The US aggressor authorities in Vietnam are racking their brains over the depletion of manpower in the South Vietnamese puppet group. A dispatch from Saigon by a "Washington Post" reporter quoted a US military officer as saying: "They have scraped the bottom of the barrel, and now they are scraping the dirt under the bottom of the barrel." This metaphor is indeed quite vivid and appropriate.
    But what about the situation of the American aggressors themselves? It seems that if they haven't scraped the bottom of the barrel, they are probably close to it.

    彼此彼此
    侵越美军当局对于南越傀儡集团兵源枯竭大伤脑筋。《华盛顿邮报》记者从西贡发出的电讯引用一个美军军官的话说：“他们已经把桶底挖穿了，现在正在刮桶底下面的泥土”。这一比喻的确颇为形象而恰当。
    但是，美国侵略者自己的情况又如何呢？看来，他们如果尚未把桶底挖穿的话，大概也差不多了。
