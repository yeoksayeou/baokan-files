    Southern Petrel
    ——Dedicated to Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau, Southern Vietnamese Heroine
    Cheng Guangrui
    What wind brought news of you, Sister Chau, what wind? Such moving news, leaving people unable to calm down. I seem to see on the South Vietnamese coast, towering giant rocks, standing firm, despite the shocking waves and raging tides. I seem to see on the South Vietnamese land, vigorous coconut trees, standing tall, despite the fierce winds and sudden rain, still calm and collected. Listen, on the Saigon River, the waves surge, that is your heart surging; look, in the southern night, the moon is white and the wind is clear, that is your unparalleled steadfastness. I entered that dark prison, reciting your blood-written verses a thousand times; I entered that torture chamber, listening to your unyielding laughter, shaking heaven and earth. Look, your blood-stained clothes, like a red flag, are flying and turning; listen, your angry words, like bullets, are fiercely attacking. I participated in your Party membership ceremony, seeing your eyes filled with crystal-clear tears, ah, the night was so dark, the lamp was so dim, the heart was so red! I saw you under torture, sometimes in a coma, sometimes waking up, when you woke up, a phantom appeared before your eyes: Uncle Ho was kindly instructing you. Isn't that you? Sister Chau, leaning against the wall, a moment of spring dream, dreaming of thousands of miles of the South, that prairie fire-like guerrilla song; dreaming of the rolling waves of the Hien Luong River, unable to express the parting of flesh and blood; dreaming of the red flag fluttering over Hoan Kiem Lake, filled with the spring breeze of victory. Sister Chau, who are you? We are strangers, completely unfamiliar, but it's like we've met somewhere before, in China? Chongqing? Yes, aren't you Sister Jiang? That green pine on Red Rock, fighting in the wind, standing in the rain, scowling coldly at the ferocity of ice and snow. Sister Chau, your birth is great; Sister Jiang, her death is glorious; you are a pair of biological sisters, equally heroic, equally steadfast. Ah, the coconut trees by the Saigon River, the green pines on the banks of the Jialing River, the same circumstances, the same ideals, the same struggle. Now, Sister Jiang has heroically sacrificed, but her motherland is covered with red flowers; Sister Chau, in order for red flowers to bloom all over the South, aren't you fighting tenaciously? Ah, more than one thousand three hundred days, a short journey in the river of time, outside the iron window, the situation is changing, how many things will make you excited and shocked. More than one thousand three hundred days, in the South, the flower of people's war is blooming more and more red, how much land has been liberated again, people are happier, the water is greener, the mountains are bluer. More than one thousand three hundred days, in this world, how many storms have been set off again, how many people have awakened again, drawing bows to shoot fierce tigers, waving swords to chop giant whales. More than one thousand three hundred days, in the fire, you have been refined like pure steel, smashing how many lies, breaking how many whips, wearing through several layers of iron chains! Now, how many mountains of knives and seas of fire are waiting for you to charge; your heroic poems have not yet been finished, how many people are waiting to recite them! Sister Chau, what wind brought your laughter, what wind? Such laughter, overflowing with revolutionary heroism, makes people so happy. I seem to see a petrel, wiping away the blood stains from its wings, flying from the sea again, facing a day of wind and rain, fighting in the sky...

    南方海燕
    ——寄越南南方女英雄阮氏珠同志
    程光锐——寄越南南方女英雄阮氏珠同志是什么风吹来你的消息，珠姐，是什么风？那么动人心弦的消息啊，叫人不能平静。我仿佛看见南越海边上，巨岩高耸，任凭惊涛激，骇浪冲，岿然不动。我仿佛看见南越土地上，椰树劲挺，任凭狂风吹，骤雨打，依旧从容。听，西贡河上，波涛汹涌，那是你心潮在翻腾；看，南方之夜，月白风清，那是你无比的坚贞。我走进那黑牢，把你血写的诗句，千百遍朗诵；我走进那刑房，听你不屈的笑声，使天地震惊。看啊，你血染的衣衫，象红旗，正飞舞翻动，听啊，你愤怒的语言，象子弹，正猛烈进攻。我参加了你的入党仪式，看你满眼热泪晶莹，啊，夜是那样黑，灯是那样暗，心是那样红！我看见你酷刑之下，一会儿昏迷，一会儿苏醒，醒来时，眼前一片幻影：胡伯伯正亲切地叮咛。那不是你吗？珠姐，倚在墙边，片刻春梦，梦见千里南方，那如火燎原的游击歌声；梦见贤良江波浪滔滔，诉不尽骨肉的离情；梦见还剑湖红旗猎猎，兜满了胜利的春风。珠姐，你是谁？我们素不相识，十分陌生，可是，又象在哪里见过面，在中国？重庆？是的，你不就是江姐吗？那红岩上的青松，风里斗，雨里挺，横眉冷对冰雪的狰狞。珠姐，你是生的伟大；江姐，她是死的光荣；你们是一对亲生的姐妹，一样英勇，一样坚贞。啊，西贡河边的椰树，嘉陵江畔的青松，一样的境遇，一样的理想，一样的斗争。如今，江姐已壮烈牺牲，她的祖国却遍地花红；珠姐，为了红花开遍南方，你不正在顽强斗争？啊，一千三百多天，时间长河里短短的航程，铁窗外风云变幻，多少事会使你激动，震惊。一千三百多天，南方啊，人民战争之花越开越红，多少土地又解放了，人更欢，水更绿，山更青。一千三百多天，这世界，又掀起了多少次暴风，多少人民又觉醒了，弯弓射猛虎，挥剑斩长鲸。一千三百多天，你在烈火中，炼得象纯钢铮铮，碰碎多少谎言，震断多少皮鞭，磨穿铁链几重！如今，前面多少刀山火海，正等待你去冲锋；你英雄的诗篇还未写完，多少人正等待朗诵！珠姐，是什么风吹来你的笑声，是什么风？这样洋溢着革命豪情的笑声啊，叫人多么高兴。我仿佛看见一只海燕，把满翅的血迹揩净，又从海上飞起，迎着一天风雨，搏击长空……
