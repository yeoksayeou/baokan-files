    Act as a revolutionary pragmatist
    ——On the bumper harvest of grain and cotton in Tianmen County in 1965
    Editor's Note: Last year, in the upsurge of the "compare with, learn from, catch up with, help" movement in our country's cotton-growing areas, a number of advanced units with high yields of both grain and cotton emerged. Some areas and units used to mainly produce cotton, and the total grain output was low, relying on state supply. Now, not only is cotton continuing to have high yields, but grain has also increased, achieving bumper harvests of both grain and cotton. The reports from Tianmen and Changshu use facts to illustrate that the local natural conditions are not incapable of achieving double harvests. When they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, gave prominence to politics, educated the masses to farm for the revolution, correctly handled the relationship between grain and cotton, the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and grasped the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, the situation greatly changed. The account of Mashanzhuang is well calculated. In the past, they always thought: contributing cotton to the state and eating grain supplied by the state was something they could take for granted; after doing the calculation, they found that as long as their work was done well, they could not only eat less or none of the grain supplied by the state but also produce more grain to sell to the state. Once the ideological problem was solved, the double harvest of grain and cotton was achieved.
    Now, the southern and northern cotton-growing areas are successively entering a stage of intense preparations for plowing. It is hoped that all production units in cotton-growing areas will continue to give prominence to politics in the new production year, calculate several major accounts ideologically, and strive for bumper harvests of both grain and cotton.
      Nineteen sixty-five was a year of breaking through "barriers" for Tianmen County, Hubei Province. In this year, they broke through the "barrier" they had long yearned for: "cotton production per mu exceeding 100 jin, and grain self-sufficiency with surplus." Compared with 1964, cotton production increased by more than 40 percent, and grain production increased by 20 percent. Last year was also the year in which the people of Tianmen made the greatest contribution to the state, selling an average of 95 jin of ginned cotton per capita based on the agricultural population. At the same time, they also sold a portion of grain. This is a great victory, a victory for the vast number of cadres and masses in Tianmen who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. When summarizing the experience of last year's bumper harvest, the vast number of cadres and masses composed a rhyme: "Water has a source, a tree has roots, there are reasons for last year's bumper harvest: Chairman Mao's works are well studied, giving prominence to politics is the first rule."
              Dialectics Teaches People to Dare to "Break Through"
    Tianmen County is located in the rich Jianghan Plain and has always been known for its cotton production. Since 1962, the county's cotton production has been increasing year by year, and its contribution to the state has also been greater each year. By 1964, the county's cotton yield per mu reached 85 jin, exceeding the highest level in history. However, compared with some advanced counties inside and outside the province, the pace was not fast enough, especially in terms of achieving double harvests of grain and cotton, they always "picked one end, and let the other slide."
    In 1964, the achievement of Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, in achieving high yields of both grain and cotton greatly shocked Tianmen County. Qidong County had less cotton field area than Tianmen, but due to higher yields per mu, the total output exceeded Tianmen's. The average contribution of cotton and grain to the state per capita was also higher than that of Tianmen. Both are old cotton-growing areas, so why can Qidong contribute more cotton and more grain, while Tianmen cannot? Some counties with the same conditions have achieved 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but Tianmen cannot pass the "100-jin barrier"? From the winter of that year to the spring of 1965, the Tianmen County Party Committee studied Chairman Mao's related works with these questions in mind and used Mao Zedong Thought to examine and summarize the work of the previous years.
    Why was the pace of increase in Tianmen County not fast in the previous few years? Why did the yield of grain and cotton resemble a seesaw, with one end going up and the other going down? They identified many reasons, but unanimously believed that the most fundamental reason was that the County Party Committee had more metaphysical thinking and less dialectics in its guiding ideology. This was mainly reflected in two aspects: one was how to correctly view the contradiction between grain and cotton; the other was how to correctly understand "great drive and steady steps."
    In the past, Tianmen County often only saw one aspect of the contradiction between grain and cotton, that is, they compete for land, labor, and fertilizer. Therefore, when the County Party Committee discussed this issue, it was always trapped in the circle of "whether cotton is the main focus or grain is the main focus," and it did not dare to propose seizing double harvests of grain and cotton. In the winter of 1964, they compared themselves with Qidong's experience in achieving high yields of both grain and cotton to find shortcomings, and studied Chairman Mao's works to find reasons. They found that the essence of the problem lay in the fact that in the past, they used a one-sided and static viewpoint to view the contradiction between grain and cotton, which was competing for this and competing for that. They did not see that grain and cotton also have mutually promoting aspects, and they did not see the subjective initiative of people, the most active factor in production, in resolving these contradictions. Last year, after studying and summarizing, they had a clearer understanding of the dialectical relationship between the mutual contradiction and mutual promotion of grain and cotton. They no longer argued over whether grain was the main focus or cotton was the main focus, but instead wanted to seize double harvests of grain and cotton. They also realized that grain and cotton do have contradictions in competing for this and that, but as long as the enthusiasm of the people is mobilized, it can be resolved. To compete for land, make every effort to increase land utilization and increase yield per unit area. To compete for labor, make every effort to improve work efficiency, reform production tools, and also use reasonable arrangements of crop varieties to stagger agricultural work appropriately. To compete for fertilizer, find ways to open up fertilizer sources. As long as we see the role of people and are good at bringing their role into play, the contradictions can be resolved. In order to do a good job in grasping both, last year, from the County Party Committee to the commune and brigade, two teams were established, one team to focus on cotton and one team to focus on grain. The use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials was also properly arranged according to the proportion of grain and cotton. In addition, the weather was relatively favorable for summer crops in the period before the summer harvest, so last year the county's summer grain production increased by more than 80 million jin at once.
    In recent years, the Tianmen County Party Committee has had a one-sided understanding of "steady steps." Everything is done with the word "steady" in mind, neither being too forward nor falling behind. Things that could have been done through hard work were not dared to be done under the guidance of the idea of striving for "stability." Showing that there was more "steady effort" and not enough "daring effort." Last year, after studying Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" and reviewing the path they had taken in the previous few years, they finally realized that "daring" and "steady" are a unity of opposites. Without "daring," there is no such thing as "steady," and without "great drive," there is no such thing as "steady steps." The kind of "stability" without "daring" is essentially a manifestation of being content with the status quo and sticking to old ways. The County Party Committee comrades improved their understanding, had more dialectics in their minds, and greatly broadened their minds. They were determined to break the idea of "stability first," establish the correct idea of "great drive and steady steps," learn from Qidong, catch up with Qidong, strive for double harvests of grain and cotton, and make double contributions.
    Then, the County Party Committee convened a county-wide meeting of four-level cadres, a meeting of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, and a cotton technology meeting. At these meetings, everyone was organized to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and the experience of Qidong County in achieving high yields of both grain and cotton was discussed extensively. The articles introducing Qidong's experience and the People's Daily's editorial "Cotton-Growing Areas Should Strive for Double Harvests of Grain and Cotton" were printed into booklets and distributed to each production brigade as learning materials. At the same time, the County Party Committee took the lead in reviewing the lack of daring and the "smooth and steady" guiding ideology at these meetings. Many communes and production brigades also summarized their experiences and lessons in this regard. Through a series of meetings, discussions, summaries, and studies, the county broke through metaphysics and the idea of being content with the status quo, and fostered the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, proposing the slogan of learning from Dazhai, learning from Qidong, and farming for the revolution, making everyone's hearts warm. This laid a good ideological foundation for winning a double harvest of cotton and grain in 1965.
            Scientific Attitude Makes People Good at "Breaking Through"
    Last year, the comprehensive renewal of improved varieties of cotton in more than 700,000 mu of cotton fields in Tianmen County was an important measure to achieve a substantial increase in cotton production. Now, when cadres and the masses recall last year's struggle to comprehensively renew improved varieties of cotton, they all say that it was "broken through" with the spirit of "breaking through barriers."
    Originally, the county introduced a batch of high-quality cotton parent seeds from other places in 1964. The ginning outturn of this batch of cotton seeds reached 40 percent, which was about 8 jin more ginned cotton per 100 jin of seed cotton than the county's large-area degraded cotton seeds. However, the number of these imported high-quality cotton seeds was not large. In 1964, they were only planted in six communes including Xiaomiao, Zhaochang, and Jinxing. This year, a total of more than 7 million jin of seeds were propagated. After supporting other places with more than 3 million jin, the remaining improved varieties were less than 4 million jin after careful selection. If all 740,000 mu of cotton fields in the county were replaced with this improved variety, then each mu would only have about 5 jin of seeds. In the past, the amount of seeds used per mu of cotton field here was more than 20 jin to 30 jin. Now the amount of seeds used is only a quarter of the past. Can we ensure a full stand of seedlings? At that time, the question was: dare we break through this "barrier"? Dare we implement a comprehensive renewal of seeds? The Tianmen County Party Committee's decision on this issue showed both a high degree of revolutionary drive and a strict scientific attitude.
    The Tianmen County Party Committee conducted many investigations and analyses, and concentrated the opinions of the masses and did a lot of work among the masses before deciding to comprehensively renew cotton seeds. In 1964, the six communes that planted the introduced improved varieties used an average of only 4.3 jin of seeds per mu. Although there were few seeds, the commune members still maintained a full stand of seedlings by carefully spot-sowing at fixed distances. This is the basis for the county-wide use of about 5 jin of seeds per mu to ensure a full stand of seedlings. At the same time, the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee went to Nie Fan, Guangming and other production brigades to stay, investigate, and specifically understand the situation of cotton field seed usage. After discussions with poor and lower-middle peasants, grassroots cadres, and technicians, it was believed that one jin of seeds has 4,800 to 5,000 seeds. With an average density of 4,000 plants per mu (the local density in the past was only 2,600 to 2,700 plants), using about 5 jin of seeds per mu, each nest can be planted with four or five seeds, and it is possible to ensure one seedling with four or five seeds. Through these investigations and studies, the Tianmen County Party Committee further realized that whether or not it is possible to use about 5 jin of improved varieties per mu for comprehensive renewal depends on people. In order to have more confidence in breaking through this "barrier," before cotton sowing, the County Party Committee conscientiously summarized and promoted the experience of the six communes of Xiaomiao, Zhaochang, etc. in ensuring a full stand of seedlings with a small amount of seeds, and carried out a series of work. In this way, the cadres and commune members participating in sowing were able to meet the technical requirements ideologically and technically. As a result, cotton sowing generally met the technical requirements, and the quality was better than in any previous year.
              Let Logistics Really Serve Production
    In the struggle for a double harvest of cotton and grain in Tianmen County last year, the various logistics departments also made great contributions.
    At the time of organizing the production upsurge, the Tianmen County Party Committee realized that if the front line of production rushed forward without the strong cooperation of the logistics departments, it would be an "isolated army" and it would not be easy to break through. To this end, the county focused on organizing the staff of the financial and trade, industrial and communications departments to study Chairman Mao's works and educated them to serve agricultural production and serve the central task. The County Party Committee told them the goal and significance of the "barrier breaking" for grain and cotton production, so that each department consciously served the "barrier breaking" and served agricultural production.
    Political work is effective as soon as it is grasped. In the past, the supply and marketing cooperatives supplied chemical fertilizers and pesticides in a timely manner without violating the farming season, which was considered good service. Last year, after studying, they felt that this was not enough. They should consider how to better promote production and provide more practical and effective services for production. In the past, chemical fertilizers were sold as soon as they arrived. Last year, after conducting investigations, they found that this had a major shortcoming, that is, some production teams easily caused fertilizer waste and untimely topdressing because they did not fully master the storage and fertilization techniques. For example, topdressing was not needed at this time, but they were afraid that the fertilizer would dissolve, so they applied a large amount to the fields. When topdressing was really needed, there was often no fertilizer to apply, which affected cotton production. Last year, they changed this practice of selling as soon as the goods arrived, adopting a two-level storage system at the county and district levels, and closely cooperating with the agricultural department to supply fertilizers in stages according to the law of cotton fertilizer use. In the past, there were often uneven distribution of fertilizers between production teams, resulting in some teams having too much fertilizer and some teams not having enough. Based on this situation, before spring plowing last year, the supply and marketing departments conducted a comprehensive survey of the fertilizer surplus and deficiency of more than 5,000 cotton-growing production teams in the county. Based on the results of their census, the County Party Committee adjusted between the fertilizer-deficient teams and the fertilizer-surplus teams. This work played a certain role in the balanced increase in cotton production in Tianmen last year.
    Tianmen County has more than two mu of cultivated land per capita based on the agricultural population, and the labor force is relatively tight. In the past, the acquisition of grain, the supply of rations, and the means of production were carried out according to administrative divisions, which often caused the members of some production teams to have to travel a long way to buy and sell things, spending a lot of non-productive labor. Last year, under the guidance of the idea of everything for production and everything for the "front," the supply and marketing, grain departments, and transportation front jointly discussed and implemented supply according to economic divisions. Some batches of production materials were directly transported to the production teams, saving a large amount of manpower for the production teams. Last year, the supply and marketing departments saved about 40,000 labor days for the production teams by implementing this method of supplying chemical fertilizers alone, while also saving a large amount of expenses for the country.
              Another New Battle Begins
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Tianmen County won a double harvest of cotton and grain last year. However, the vast number of cadres and masses in Tianmen are not satisfied with this victory. They said that looking back, there are some achievements; looking forward, compared with the advanced, there are many loopholes and a large gap.
    As early as after the Spring Festival this year, the Tianmen County Party Committee held a series of meetings, used the spirit of finding shortcomings after winning a battle, used the one-divides-into-two viewpoint, and adopted the method of launching mass movements to mobilize cadres and commune members to conduct large-scale discussions, summaries, and comparisons of last year's production achievements. This large-scale discussion, summary, and comparison activity is to correctly understand where last year's achievements came from, whether the material factor is first or the human factor is first, whether technology is first or politics is first, so that everyone can have a correct view of the relationship between people and things, people and nature, and politics and technology through summarizing, so that the vast number of cadres and masses can receive an education in Mao Zedong Thought. The second is to truly recognize their shortcomings, and boost the revolutionary drive to "surpass the advanced and become a pioneer" by comparing with the advanced, finding gaps, and tapping potential, and to win a greater harvest of grain and cotton again.
    At present, the cadre meetings and the meetings of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the county to the commune levels have all been held. This large-scale discussion, summary, and comparison activity is deepening into the production teams and is being carried out among the vast number of commune members. At the same time, the preparations for plowing cotton fields and paddy fields are also underway in various places. Water conservancy projects are being stepped up. The whole county is working hard to strive for a greater harvest of grain and cotton in 1966.

    当革命的实干家
    ——记天门县一九六五年的粮棉双丰收
    编者按：去年，我国各棉区，在比学赶帮超运动中，涌现了一批粮棉双高产的先进单位。有些地区和单位过去主要生产棉花，粮食总产较低，要靠国家供应。现在不但棉花继续高产，粮食也上去了，做到粮棉双丰收。天门、常熟的报道，用事实说明，并不是当地自然条件不能争取双丰收。当他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，教育群众为革命种田，正确处理了粮棉关系，国家、集体、个人三者关系，阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命一齐抓，情况就大有改变。马山庄的一笔大账算得好。过去他们总以为：给国家贡献棉花，吃国家供应的粮食，心安理得；经过算账，发现只要自己的工作做得好，不但可以少吃、不吃国家供应的粮食，而且可以多产粮食卖给国家。思想问题一解决，就实现了粮棉双丰收。
    现在，南北棉区相继进入紧张备耕阶段。希望棉区各生产单位，在新的生产年度中，继续突出政治，从思想上算几笔大账，争取粮棉双丰收。
      一九六五年，对湖北天门县来说，是闯“关”的一年。这一年，他们久所向往的“棉花亩产过百斤，粮食自给有余”的
  “关”闯过来了。与一九六四年比较，棉花增产四成多，粮食增产两成。去年也是天门人民向国家贡献最大的一年，按农业人口平均每人售皮棉九十五斤。同时，还出售一部分粮食。这是一个很大的胜利，这是天门广大干部和群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的胜利。广大干部和群众在总结去年丰收经验时，编
  了一个顺口溜“水有源，树有根，去年丰收有原因：毛主席著作学得好，突出政治第一条。”
              辩证法教人勇于“闯”
    天门县位于富饶的江汉平原，一向以产棉著称。一九六二年以来，这个县棉花产量逐年上升，对国家贡献也一年比一年大，到一九六四年，全县棉花单产达到八十五斤，超过历史上最高水平，但是同省内外一些先进县比较起来，步子迈得还不够快，特别是在夺取粮棉双丰收方面，总是“挑一头，溜一头”。
    一九六四年，江苏启东县夺得粮棉双高产的事迹，使天门县上下受到很大震动。启东县棉田面积比天门少，但这一年由于单产高，总产量却超过了天门，平均每人贡献给国家的棉花和粮食也都比天门多。同样是老棉区，为什么启东能做到棉花贡献大，粮食贡献也大，而天门却做不到？不少条件相同的县达到亩产皮棉百斤，而天门却过不了“百斤关”？这年冬到一九六五年春，天门县委带着这些问题学习毛主席的有关著作，用毛泽东思想检查、总结前几年的工作。
    天门县前几年为什么增产的步子不快，为什么粮食、棉花产量象坐“翘板”，一头上，一头下？他们检查出了许多原因，但一致认为最根本的原因是县委领导思想的形而上学多了一些，辩证法少了一些。这突出表现在两个方面：一个是如何正确看待粮棉矛盾；一个是如何正确认识“干劲要大，步子要稳”。
    过去，天门县在处理粮棉关系问题上，往往只看到粮棉有争土地、争劳力、争肥料的矛盾的一方面。因此，县委讨论这个问题时，总是陷在“是以棉为主，还是以粮为主”的圈子里，可就是不敢提出夺取粮棉双丰收。一九六四年冬，他们对照启东粮棉双高产经验找差距，学习毛主席著作找原因，发现问题的本质在于过去用片面的、静止的观点来看待粮食、棉花争这争那，互相矛盾的方面，看不到粮食、棉花还有互相促进的一方面，看不到人——这个生产中最活跃的因素，在解决这些矛盾中的主观能动作用。去年，他们经过学习、总结，对粮棉互相矛盾又互相促进的辩证关系，认识得比较清楚了，不再在以粮为主还是以棉为主的问题上争论了，而是要夺取粮棉双丰收。他们也认识到，粮棉确实有争这争那的矛盾，但只要把人的积极性调动起来，是可以解决的。争土地，就千方百计提高土地利用率，提高单位面积产量。争劳力，就千方百计提高工效，改革生产工具，还可用合理安排作物品种的办法把农活适当错开。争肥料，就想办法开辟肥料来源。只要看到人的作用，又善于发挥人的作用，矛盾是可以解决的。为了作好两手抓，去年从县委到公社、大队，都建立了两套班子，一套班子抓棉花，一套班子抓粮食。肥料、农药和其他物资的使用，也按粮棉比例作了恰当安排。加上夏收前一段期间，气候对夏收作物比较有利，因此，去年全县夏粮一下增产八千多万斤。
    近几年，天门县委对“步子要稳”有着片面的理解，干什么都是“稳”字当头，既不冒尖，也不落后。本来经过努力可以办到的，也在力求“稳当”的思想指导下，不敢干了。表现出“稳劲”有余，“闯劲”不足。去年，经过学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等著作，回顾前几年走过的路子，他们终于认识到“闯”和“稳”是对立的统一，没有“闯”，也就无所谓“稳”，没有“干劲大”，也就不存在“步子稳”。而那种没有“闯劲”的“稳”，实质上是安于现状，故步自封的表现。县委同志们的认识提高了，脑子里的辩证法多了，心胸大为开阔，决心破“稳字当头”的思想，树立正确的“干劲要大步子要稳”的思想，学启东，赶启东，争取粮棉双丰收，做出双贡献。
    接着，县委召开了全县四级干部会，贫农下中农代表会和棉花技术会，在这些会议上，组织大家学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等文章，大讲启东县粮棉双高产的经验，并且把介绍启东经验的文章和人民日报的《产棉区要力争粮棉双丰收》的社论，印成小册子发到各生产大队作为学习资料。同时县委在这些会上带头检讨了闯劲不足，“四平八稳”的指导思想。许多公社、生产大队也都总结了这方面的经验教训。全县通过一系列会议的讨论、总结、学习，从领导到群众大破形而上学，大破安于现状的思想，大长敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命闯劲，提出学大寨、学启东，为革命种田的口号，把大家心里搞的热呼呼的。从而为夺取一九六五年棉粮双丰收打下良好思想基础。
            科学态度使人善于“闯”
    去年，天门县七十多万亩棉田全面更新良种，是夺得棉花大幅度增产的一项重要措施。现在，干部和群众回忆起去年全面更新良种的斗争，都说，那是用“闯关”的精神“闯”过来的。
    原来，这个县在一九六四年从外地引进一批优良棉花原种，这批棉种的衣分率达百分之四十，比全县大面积的退化棉种，每百斤籽棉要多产皮棉八斤左右。但是引进的这批优良棉种数量不多，一九六四年只放在小庙、赵场、金星等六个公社种植，这一年一共只繁育种子七百多万斤，除支援外地三百多万斤，剩下的良种经过精选后，不到四百万斤了。如果全县七十四万多亩棉田都换上这个良种，那每亩只有五斤左右种子。而这里过去每亩棉田的用种量是二十多斤到三十斤。现在用种量只及过去的四分之一，能保全苗吗？当时摆着的问题是：这一“关”敢不敢闯？敢不敢实行全面更新种子？天门县委对于这个问题的决定，既表现了高度的革命干劲，也表现了严格的科学态度。
    天门县委作了许多调查、分析，并且集中了群众的意见，在群众中做了许多工作，才下决心全面更新棉种。一九六四年那六个种植引进良种的公社，平均每亩只用了四斤三两种子，种子少，但社员们用精心定距点播的办法，仍保住了全苗、齐苗。这就是全县大面积每亩可用五斤左右种子保全苗的依据。同时县委负责同志分别到聂范、光明等生产大队蹲点、调查，具体了解棉田用种量的情况，经过和贫农下中农、基层干部、技术员座谈，认为，一斤种子有四千八百粒到五千粒，平均每亩以四千株密度计算（当地过去密度只二千六七百株），每亩用五斤左右种子，每窝可种四五粒，以四五粒种子保一株苗是可能的。天门县委通过这些调查研究，进一步认清了能不能用每亩五斤左右的良种进行全面更新，关键在于人。为了更有把握地闯过这一“关”，在棉花播种前，县委认真地总结和推广了小庙、赵场等六个公社用少量种子保全苗的经验，并进行了一系列工作。这样，使参加播种的干部和社员做到思想、技术都过得硬。结果，棉花播种普遍达到技术要求，质量比以往任何一年都好。
              让后勤切实为生产服务
    天门县去年夺取棉粮双丰收的斗争中，各个后勤部门也作出了很大的贡献。
    在组织生产高潮的时候，天门县委就认识到，光是生产第一线往前闯，后勤部门不给以有力的配合，就会“孤军”深入，就不容易闯上去。为此，全县抓紧组织财贸、工交各部门的职工学习毛主席著作，向他们进行为农业生产服务，为中心服务的教育。县委把粮棉生产“闯关”的目标、意义告诉他们，使各部门自觉地为“闯关”服务，为农业生产服务。
    政治工作一抓就灵。过去，供销社供应化肥、农药，做到如期供应，不违农时，就算服务得好了。去年，他们经过学习后，觉得仅仅是这样还不够，应该从如何更好地促进生产来考虑，做到更能切实有效地为生产服务。过去供应化肥是货到就卖。去年他们通过在下面调查，发现这样做有个很大缺点，就是一部分生产队由于没有完全掌握存放和施肥技术，容易造成肥料浪费和追肥不适时。例如本来这个时候不需要追肥，但怕肥料溶化，也就大量往田里施，到正需要施肥的时候，往往又无肥可施了，这就影响棉花产量。去年他们改变这种货到就卖的做法，采取县、区两级储存，同农业部门密切配合，按棉花用肥的规律，分期供应。过去化肥的分配，生产队与生产队之间往往有畸多畸少的现象，以致有的队化肥用不完，有的队不够用。根据这个情况，去年春耕前，供销部门对全县五千多个棉区生产队的化肥余缺情况进行全面调查，县委根据他们普查结果，在缺肥队和余肥队之间进行调剂。这一工作，对天门去年棉花平衡增产起了一定的作用。
    天门县按农业人口平均，每人有两亩多耕地，劳动力比较紧张。过去按行政区划收购粮食、供应口粮和生产资料，往往使一部分生产队的社员要绕很远的路买卖东西，花费很多非生产性的劳动。去年，在一切为生产，一切为“前方”的思想指导下，由供销、粮食部门和交通运输战线共同商量，实行按经济区划供应，有些成批的生产资料直接运到生产队，为生产队节省了大批人力。仅供销部门去年由于实行这种办法供应化肥，就为生产队节省了大约四万个劳动日，同时为国家节约大批费用。
              又一个新的战斗开始
    天门县去年在毛泽东思想指导下，夺得了棉粮双丰收的胜利。但天门的广大干部、群众并没有满足这一胜利。他们说，向后看，成绩有些；向前看，比先进，漏洞不少，差距很大。
    早在今年春节过后，天门县委就召开了一系列会议，用打了胜仗找缺点的精神，用一分为二的观点，采取搞群众运动的方法，发动干部和社员群众对去年的生产成绩进行大讨论、大总结、大评比。这个大讨论、大总结、大评比活动，一是正确认识去年的成绩是从哪里来的，是物的因素第一，还是人的因素第一？是技术第一，还是政治第一？使大家通过总结，对人和物、人和天、政治和技术的关系有个正确的看法，从而使广大干部和群众受到一次毛泽东思想的教育。二是通过比先进，找差距，挖潜力，真正认识自己不足之处，鼓起“超先进，当闯将”的革命干劲，再夺粮棉高产。
    目前，从县到公社的各级干部会和贫农下中农代表会，都已经开过了。这一大讨论、大总结、大评比活动正深入到生产队，在广大社员群众中开展。和这同时，各地的棉田、稻田备耕活动也正在紧张进行。水利工程正在加紧施工。全县上下正为争取一九六六年粮棉更大丰收而艰苦奋斗。
