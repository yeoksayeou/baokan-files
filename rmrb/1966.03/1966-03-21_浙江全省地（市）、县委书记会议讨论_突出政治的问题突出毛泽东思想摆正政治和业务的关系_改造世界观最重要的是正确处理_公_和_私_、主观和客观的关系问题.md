    (Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 19th) The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently convened a conference of prefectural (municipal) and county Party committee secretaries. With prominent ideological and work problems in mind, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and discussed how to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

    This was a meeting focused on creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The comrades who attended the meeting studied the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on politics being the commander and the soul, examined their thinking, and summarized their experiences. They further recognized that emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to command, transform, and promote everything, has great strategic significance. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, against revisionism, for preventing revisionism, and for building socialism. It is the guiding principle for all our work. Once Mao Zedong Thought is mastered by cadres and the masses, it will become a tremendous material force for transforming society and the world, and a powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Every Communist Party member, especially leading Party cadres, should more consciously regard Chairman Mao's books as supreme instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves, educate the people, summarize experiences, and solve problems.

    Everyone believed that to emphasize politics and adhere to the principle of Mao Zedong Thought taking command, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against two erroneous tendencies. One is to oppose the purely professional viewpoint of emphasizing work and neglecting politics, and the eclectic viewpoint of equating politics and work, and to rectify the relationship between politics and work. The other is to overcome the complacency and empiricism that believes one can "get by" without learning, relying on past achievements, and to rectify the relationship between study and work. Emphasizing politics is an objective law that is independent of people's will. If proletarian politics is not emphasized, bourgeois politics will inevitably be emphasized. If Mao Zedong Thought is not studied, one will lose direction and go astray. Using Mao Zedong Thought to command work will ensure the correct direction and thriving work; grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works to drive work will ensure smooth work and twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, whether or not politics is emphasized is a matter of success or failure of the revolution, and of the progress or regression of society. Emphasizing politics and emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought is a grand plan for centuries, millennia, and ten thousand years.

    The comrades attending the meeting unanimously believed that to emphasize politics and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the most fundamental thing is to transform one's worldview. On the issue of transforming the worldview, the most important are the following two issues:

    First, correctly handle the relationship between "public" and "private." Using Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people as a weapon, and taking advanced figures like Jiao Yulu as examples, the comrades present at the meeting saw their problems to varying degrees, examined and criticized prominent problems in their thinking. They believed that a Communist Party member, especially a leading Party cadre, should see farther and be more broad-minded than others. "Farther" means seeing the bright future of the communist cause, making revolution forever, making revolution thoroughly, making revolution in the first half of one's life, and making revolution better in the second half of one's life, consistently benefiting the people and the revolution, dedicating oneself to the people and the revolution until one's last breath. "Broader" means having the motherland in one's heart, taking a global view, and serving the vast majority of the people of China and the world unswervingly.

    Individualism is the core of bourgeois ideology, and overcoming individualism is the core of transforming one's worldview. Only when a person puts the "public" interest first can they have a clear direction and a clear sense of love and hatred. Putting the "self" first will lead to losing direction and being unable to distinguish between friends and enemies. Only when the "public" interest is put first can one be selfless, dedicated to serving others, open-minded, and feel comfortable. Putting the "self" first will lead to pursuing fame and fortune, being preoccupied with status, fearing hardship and death, and being anxious about gains and losses. Only when the "public" interest is put first can one refrain from taking credit for achievements, refrain from concealing mistakes, dare to uphold the truth, dare to be realistic, dare to correct mistakes, and dare to fight against all words and deeds that harm the interests of the people. Putting the "self" first will lead to being unable to withstand praise, unable to withstand criticism, unable to adhere to principles, correct errors, and unable to proceed from reality and be responsible to the people.

    Only when the "public" interest is put first can one be courageous, discover, invent, create, and make progress. Putting the "self" first will lead to being timid, getting by, being arrogant, sticking to old ways, and accomplishing nothing.

    The "public" and the "self" are a class struggle in ideology, waxing and waning with each other, and cannot "peacefully coexist." We must fight against the "self" every day, every month, every year, and forever. The cause of revolution is endless, and self-transformation is also endless. Going against the current, one will retreat if one does not advance, and there can be no relaxation. Only by sweeping away the root of all evils, bourgeois individualism, and establishing the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people, can we better shoulder the historical mission of opposing imperialism, opposing revisionism, preventing revisionism, and building socialism.

    Second, correctly handle the relationship between the subjective and the objective. The comrades attending the meeting re-read Chairman Mao's relevant philosophical works and cited a large number of facts to illustrate that initiative comes from seeking truth from facts, from understanding objective laws, and from transforming the objective world. When the subjective correctly reflects the objective, work will be fast, good, and economical, and as irresistible as a bamboo splitting. When the subjective and objective are inconsistent, work will be slow, poor, and wasteful, and suffer setbacks. We cannot rely solely on enthusiasm in making revolution and carrying out construction. We must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific spirit. Enthusiasm should be great, and steps should be steady.

    Everyone believed that there is no shortcut to making one's thinking conform to the regularity of the objective external world. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn to apply materialism and dialectics in actual work, be good at investigation and research, be good at analyzing contradictions, be good at summarizing experiences, and constantly fight against subjectivism and metaphysics. We must overcome the shortcomings of "investigating situations without analyzing them, and doing work without summarizing it" in order to be more conscious and less blind, make fewer mistakes, and do better work.

    The comrades attending the meeting also earnestly discussed the issue of democratic centralism. They studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and further realized that democratic centralism is a fundamental issue in the life of our Party. There must be full democratic life both inside and outside the Party. Without democracy, there can be no correct centralization. Without democracy, if opinions do not come from the masses, it will be impossible to formulate good lines, principles, policies, and methods, and there will be no enthusiasm and creativity from the broad masses. To implement democratic centralism, we must correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective. We must place ourselves within the collective and the masses, and not above the collective and the masses. We must listen to opinions from all sides, especially patiently listen to opposing opinions and critical opinions, and let people finish speaking, and not always be self-righteous. All major matters must be discussed and decided by everyone, and everyone must carry them out separately. We should promote "group speech hall" and oppose "one-man speech hall." Only by truly implementing democratic centralism can we create a political situation inside and outside the Party that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and allows for individual ease of mind and lively activity.

    After this meeting, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee held a plenary session and passed a resolution on earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works.

    浙江全省地（市）、县委书记会议讨论
    突出政治的问题突出毛泽东思想摆正政治和业务的关系
    改造世界观最重要的是正确处理“公”和“私”、主观和客观的关系问题
    据新华社杭州十九日电　中共浙江省委最近召开全省地（市）、县委书记会议，带着当前思想上和工作上的突出问题，学习了毛主席的有关著作，讨论了怎样把毛泽东思想真正学到手的问题。
    这是一次活学活用毛主席著作的会议。到会同志学习了党中央和毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂的指示，检查了思想，总结了经验，进一步认识到，突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、改造一切、推动一切，具有伟大的战略意义。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和防止修正主义、建设社会主义的强大思想武器，是我们一切工作的指针。毛泽东思想一旦被干部、群众所掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的巨大物质力量，就会成为威力强大的精神原子弹。每一个共产党员，特别是党员领导干部，都应当更加自觉地把毛主席的书当作最高指示，用毛泽东思想改造自己，教育人民，总结经验，解决问题。
    大家认为，要突出政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，和两种错误倾向作斗争。一是要反对那种重业务轻政治的单纯业务观点，把政治和业务并列起来的折衷主义观点，摆正政治和业务的关系；二是克服那种认为凭老本钱不学习也“过得去”的自满情绪和经验主义思想，摆正学习和工作的关系。突出政治，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。不突出无产阶级的政治，势必突出资产阶级的政治；不学习毛泽东思想，就会迷失方向，走到邪路上去。用毛泽东思想去统帅业务，则方向对头，业务兴旺；抓学习毛主席著作去带动工作，则工作顺利，事半功倍。因此，突出不突出政治，是关系到革命成功还是失败的问题，社会前进还是倒退的问题；突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    到会同志一致认为，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，最根本的是改造世界观。在改造世界观的问题上，最重要的是以下两个问题：
    第一，正确处理“公”和“私”的关系问题。到会同志以毛主席为人民服务的思想为武器，以焦裕禄等先进人物为榜样，在不同程度上看到了自己的问题，检查和批判了思想上的突出问题，认为一个共产党员，特别是党员领导干部，应当比别人看得远一些，大一些。远，就是要看到共产主义事业的光辉前景，永远革命，彻底革命，前半辈子革命，后半辈子更好地革命，一贯地有益于人民，一贯地有益于革命，为人民为革命鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。大，就是要胸怀祖国，放眼世界，坚定不移地为全中国和全世界绝大多数人民服务。
    个人主义是资产阶级思想的核心，克服个人主义是改造世界观的核心。一个人“公”字当头，才能方向明确，爱憎分明；“我”字当头，就会迷失方向，敌我不分。“公”字当头，才能毫不利己，专门利人，襟怀坦白，心情舒畅；“我”字当头，就会追求名利，计较地位，怕苦怕死，患得患失。“公”字当头，才能有了成绩不居功，有了错误不掩饰，敢于坚持真理，敢于实事求是，敢于修正错误，敢于同一切危害人民利益的言行作斗争；“我”字当头，就会经不起表扬，经不起批评，不能坚持原则，纠正错误，不能从实际出发，向人民负责。
  “公”字当头，才能勇往直前，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进；“我”字当头，就会畏首畏尾，得过且过，骄傲自满，故步自封，无所作为。
    一“公”一“我”，是意识形态上的阶级斗争，彼此消长，不能“和平共处”。要和“我”字天天斗，月月斗，年年斗，永远斗下去。革命的事业是无止境的，自我改造也是无止境的。逆水行舟，不进则退，丝毫不能放松。只有扫掉资产阶级个人主义这个万恶根源，确立完全地彻底地为人民服务的思想，才能更好地担负起反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和防止修正主义、建设社会主义的历史使命。
    第二，正确处理主观和客观的关系。到会同志重读了毛主席的有关哲学著作，列举大量事实说明：主动权来自实事求是，来自对客观规律的认识和对客观世界的改造。主观正确反映客观，工作就多快好省，势如破竹；主观和客观不一致，工作就少慢差费，遭受挫折。我们干革命，搞建设，不能光凭热情，要把革命热情和科学精神结合起来。干劲要大，步子要稳。
    大家认为，要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，没有捷径可走，只有按照毛主席的教导，学会在实际工作中应用唯物论、辩证法，善于调查研究，善于分析矛盾，善于总结经验，不断地同主观主义、形而上学作斗争，克服那种“摸了情况不分析，做了工作不总结”的毛病，才能多一点自觉性，少一点盲目性，才能少犯错误，做好工作。
    到会同志还认真讨论了民主集中制问题。大家学习了毛主席的有关指示，进一步认识到，民主集中制是我们党的生活中一个根本性的问题。不论党内党外，都要有充分的民主生活。没有民主，不可能有正确的集中。没有民主，意见不是从群众中来，就不可能制定出好的路线、方针、政策和办法，就不可能有广大群众的积极性和创造性。要实行民主集中制，就要正确处理个人与集体的关系。要把自己放在集体和群众之中，不要把自己放在集体和群众之上。要听各方面的意见，特别是要耐心听那些反对的意见和批评的意见，要让人家把话说完，不要总是自以为是。一切重大事情，要大家商量办，大家说了算，大家分头干，提倡“群言堂”，反对“一言堂”。只有真正实行民主集中制，才能在党内和党外造成又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼那样一种政治局面。
    这次会议以后，浙江省委举行了全体会议，通过了关于认真学习毛主席著作的决定。
