    The African People Will Surely Defeat Imperialism and Its Running Dogs
    President Touré Reiterates at Women's Rally in Conakry Full Support for the Ghanaian People Against the Rebellion
    President Keïta Calls on the Malian People to Be Vigilant Against Imperialism and Colonialism
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 7th—A women's rally was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, on the evening of the 6th to condemn the imperialist-orchestrated coup in Ghana and to express firm support for the Ghanaian people.
    President Sékou Touré and President Nkrumah attended the rally. The women chanted: "Long live Ghana!" "Long live the African Revolution!" "Down with imperialism and its running dogs!"
    Speaking at the rally, President Sékou Touré reiterated that the Guinean people would do everything possible to support the fraternal Ghanaian people. He said that the Ghanaian and Guinean people, with the strong support of the people of all African countries, will surely smash the military rebellion in Ghana.
    The mass meeting passed a telegram to the National Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea. The telegram stated that the women of the Second District of Conakry were extremely indignant at the military coup launched by imperialism in collusion with African traitors and expressed their heartfelt support for the fraternal Ghanaian people. They will wage a relentless struggle against imperialism, neo-colonialism, old colonialism, and their puppets in Africa.
    In the telegram, the women of the Second District of Conakry vowed to unswervingly implement the following slogan: Be vigilant! We must counter the violence of imperialism with revolutionary violence!
    A similar mass rally was also held by the women of the First District of Conakry on the evening of the 7th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 7th—In an editorial published on the 9th anniversary of Ghana's independence, *Liberté*, the organ of the Democratic Party of Guinea, reiterated that the Guinean people actively support the Ghanaian people and are determined to stand with the fraternal Ghanaian people to stop the clutches of imperialism.
    The editorial severely condemned imperialism for plotting the heinous coup. It said that the purpose of the Ghanaian puppets, nurtured by those holding London wallets, and imperialism is to overthrow the Republic of Ghana, stifle the Ghanaian liberation revolution, and stifle the Ghanaian people.
    The editorial pointed out that President Nkrumah is still leading the Convention People's Party and the heroic Ghanaian people in fighting against the usurpers. Although anti-people elements have plotted a despicable conspiracy in favor of their Western lenders, Africa will equally win in Accra.
    The editorial called on the people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism.
    Conakry Radio, in a commentary broadcast on the 9th anniversary of Ghana's independence on the 6th, said: "The Ghanaian people will surely win, and the usurpers will be overthrown."
    The radio station condemned Britain and the United States for supporting the Ghanaian military traitors. The radio station said: The hasty recognition of the traitorous regime in Ghana and all the decisions announced in London and Washington regarding the granting of economic and financial assistance to the usurpers in Accra are useless. It is absurd and ridiculous for imperialism to think that it can use money to buy the freedom that the Ghanaian people have obtained at a high price. Imperialism will inevitably suffer a greater defeat in Ghana.
    The radio station said that the Guinean people solemnly declare that they are determined to frustrate and smash the subversive conspiracies of imperialism, no matter where imperialism comes from or in what guise it appears. The people, armed to serve the freedom of Africa, guarantee to show solidarity with the fraternal Ghanaian people and the peoples of all countries who are fighting against dying imperialism.
    The radio station said that the Guinean people will continue to support the fraternal Ghanaian people without reservation until the complete victory over the foreign-nurtured traitors.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, March 8th—Malian President Modibo Keïta has called on the Malian people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism and colonialism.
    Speaking at the Sixth Economic Conference of the Bamako Region held recently in Bamako, he said, "We always stand with the people who are willing to fight to defend their rights to freedom and dignity and resist imperialism and neo-colonialism."
    He said: To be vigilant requires that "we ourselves not be intimidated by temporary difficulties that will soon pass, and we must arm ourselves ideologically."
    He pointed out that with a dual vigilance towards ourselves and towards the outside, we can further arm ourselves to deal with the difficulties encountered in safeguarding national independence and carrying out construction, and to deal with the obstacles set by colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism.

    非洲人民必将战胜帝国主义及其走狗
    杜尔总统在科纳克里妇女集会上重申全力支援加纳人民反对叛乱
    凯塔总统号召马里人民对帝国主义和殖民主义保持警惕
    新华社科纳克里七日电  几内亚首都科纳克里妇女六日晚举行集会，谴责帝国主义策划加纳政变，表示坚决支持加纳人民。
    塞古·杜尔总统和恩克鲁玛总统参加了集会。妇女们高呼：“加纳万岁！”“非洲革命万岁！”“打倒帝国主义及其走狗！”
    塞古·杜尔总统在集会上讲话时，重申几内亚人民尽一切努力支援兄弟的加纳人民。他说，受到非洲各国人民有力支持的加纳和几内亚两国人民必将粉碎在加纳的军事叛乱。
    群众大会通过一封给几内亚民主党全国政治局的电报。电报说，科纳克里第二区的妇女们对帝国主义和非洲叛徒勾结在一起发动的军事政变十分愤慨，并且对兄弟的加纳人民表示衷心的支持。她们将对帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其在非洲的傀儡进行无情的斗争。
    科纳克里第二区的妇女们在电报中宣誓要坚持不懈地执行下列口号：保持警惕！我们要以革命的暴力来对付帝国主义的暴力！
    科纳克里第一区的妇女们七日晚也举行了类似的群众集会。
    新华社科纳克里七日电  几内亚民主党机关刊《自由报》七日就加纳独立九周年发表社论重申，几内亚人民积极支援加纳人民，并且决心同兄弟的加纳人民站在一起，制止帝国主义的魔爪。
    社论严厉指责帝国主义策动罪恶的政变。它说，受手持伦敦钱包的人豢养的加纳傀儡和帝国主义的目的，是要推翻加纳共和国，扼杀加纳解放革命，扼杀加纳人民。
    社论指出，恩克鲁玛总统仍在领导加纳人民大会党和英勇的加纳人民，向篡夺者进行斗争。尽管反人民分子策划了有利于他们的西方贷款人的卑鄙阴谋，非洲同样地要在阿克拉赢得胜利。
    社论号召人民对帝国主义的阴谋保持警惕。
    科纳克里电台六日在为庆祝加纳独立九周年发表评论中说：“加纳人民定将胜利，篡夺者将被打倒”。
    电台谴责英国和美国支持加纳军人叛徒。电台说：对加纳卖国政权的迫不及待的承认，以及在伦敦和华盛顿宣布的关于给予阿克拉篡夺者以经济和财政援助的一切决定，都是没有用处的。帝国主义认为它能够用金钱购买加纳人民付出高昂代价所获得的自由，这是荒谬可笑的。帝国主义在加纳必将遭到更大的失败。
    电台说，几内亚人民庄严地宣布，他们决心挫败和粉碎帝国主义的颠覆阴谋，不管帝国主义从什么地方来，以什么姿态出现。武装起来为非洲自由服务的人民，保证声援兄弟的加纳人民和正在同垂死的帝国主义进行斗争的各国人民。
    电台说，几内亚人民将继续无保留地支持兄弟的加纳人民，直到完全战胜外国豢养的叛徒为止。
    据新华社巴马科八日电  马里总统莫迪博·凯塔号召马里人民对帝国主义和殖民主义的阴谋保持警惕。
    他在最近在巴马科举行的巴马科地区第六次经济会议上讲话时说，“我们始终同愿意为维护自己的自由和尊严的权利而战斗的人民站在一起，抵挡帝国主义和新殖民主义。”
    他说：要保持警惕，就要求“我们自己不要被暂时的很快就会过去的困难所吓倒，我们要在意识形态上武装自己。”
    他指出，有了对自己和对外部的双重警惕，就可以进一步武装起来，对付在维护民族独立和进行建设中遇到的困难，对付殖民主义、帝国主义和新殖民主义所设置的障碍。
