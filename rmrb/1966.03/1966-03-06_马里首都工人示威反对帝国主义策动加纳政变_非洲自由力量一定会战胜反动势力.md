    Malian Capital Workers Demonstrate Against Imperialist-Instigated Coup in Ghana
    African Forces of Freedom Will Surely Defeat Reactionary Forces
    President Keita Announces Withdrawal of Embassy in Accra and Expresses Support for the People of Ghana
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: Bamako dispatch: Malian President Modibo Keita announced in the National Assembly on March 2nd, when speaking about the coup in Ghana, that Mali has decided to withdraw its embassy in Accra.
    He also announced that Mali's delegation attending the Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of African Unity had been ordered to withdraw from the meeting and return home immediately to protest the presence of representatives from the Ghanaian coup authorities.
    President Modibo Keita pointed out that the spearhead of the coup in Ghana was actually "aimed at all the sovereignty and genuine freedom that still exist in Africa."
    He announced that Mali unequivocally supports the people of Ghana.
    He said that neocolonialism has changed its tactics, implementing a new gunboat policy in the past year or so. "Although seemingly fierce, it does not indicate that those who constantly plot conspiracies against our freedom are strong. On the contrary, it proves that the political and ideological consciousness of the African people has greatly improved over the years." He expressed his belief that the forces of freedom will surely defeat the reactionary forces.
    On the afternoon of February 28th, thousands of workers in the city and suburbs of Bamako, the capital of Mali, held demonstrations against the imperialist-instigated military coup in Ghana. During the march, they shouted: No to imperialism, no to colonialism, no to neocolonialism, we want true independence, we want African dignity. After the march, they held a rally.
    Sisoko, Secretary-General of the National Workers' Union of Mali, said in his speech that "the subversion suffered by our Ghanaian brothers is a shameful crime of imperialism. Such crimes of imperialism occur endlessly whenever the people of a country express their desire for independence, freedom, and progress, their determination to control their own destiny, and especially their determination to no longer be exploited."
    Sisoko condemned the crimes of imperialism in South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Portuguese colonies, and Vietnam.
    Sisoko said: "Imperialism is the main enemy of all people and the real criminal against the people of African countries." He pointed out that "no matter what evil schemes imperialism plots now and in the future, the African people will surely achieve victory."
    The National Union of Journalists of Mali issued a statement on March 1st saying: "The military coup that is currently causing bloodshed in Ghana is another crime committed by imperialism and international trusts, whose nature is to dominate the world, against the independence, freedom, and dignity of the people of African countries."
    The statement said that the recent series of dangerous events in Africa fully demonstrate that the enemies of the African people are implementing a vicious plan to restore colonialism. The statement called for stopping the claws of the imperialist aggressors.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: Bamako dispatch: Under the chairmanship of Modibo Keita, Secretary-General of the Sudanese Union Party and President of the Republic, the Sudanese Union Party held a cadre meeting in Bamako on the 1st to discuss the impact of the coup in Ghana on the situation. The meeting decided to immediately establish a National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution.
    Members of the National Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union Party, government and parliament members, and heads of various people's organizations attended the meeting.
    President Modibo Keita said at the meeting that Mali and Africa must learn a lesson from the events in Ghana.
    The President said, "At this critical moment for Africa, we are prepared to fulfill our duties to the end."
    He asked the soldiers to be vigilant in order to defend the Malian revolution.
    Colonel Sekou Traore, Chief of Staff of the Malian Army, reiterated on behalf of the army that the army fully supports the Party, the government, and the state organizations.
    He said that in Mali, any collusion by imperialists and their agents at home and abroad will be thwarted and is doomed to failure.

    马里首都工人示威反对帝国主义策动加纳政变
    非洲自由力量一定会战胜反动势力
    凯塔总统宣布撤回驻阿克拉使馆并表示支持加纳人民
    新华社五日讯　巴马科消息：马里总统莫迪博·凯塔三月二日在国民议会就加纳政变发表讲话时宣布，马里已经决定撤回它驻阿克拉的大使馆。
    他还宣布，马里出席非洲统一组织部长理事会会议的代表团已经奉命退出会议，并且立刻回国，以抗议加纳政变当局的代表出席这个会议。
    莫迪博·凯塔总统指出，加纳政变的矛头实际上“是指向在非洲还存在的全部主权和真正自由”。
    他宣布，马里毫不含糊地支持加纳人民。
    他说，新殖民主义改变了手法，在最近一年多来执行新的炮舰政策，“虽然表面上气势汹汹，但并不表示那些不断策划阴谋反对我们自由的人有力量。恰恰相反，这证明几年以来非洲人民的政治思想觉悟已经大大提高了”。他表示相信，自由的力量一定会战胜反动势力。
    二月二十八日下午，马里首都巴马科市和郊区数千名工人举行示威游行，反对帝国主义在加纳策动军事政变。他们在游行时高呼：不要帝国主义、不要殖民主义、不要新殖民主义，要真正的独立，要非洲的尊严。游行结束后，他们举行了大会。
    马里全国工人联合会总书记西索科在会上讲话时说，“使加纳兄弟受害的颠覆是帝国主义的一种可耻的罪行。每当一个国家的人民表示要求独立、自由和进步的愿望，表示决心要掌握自己的命运的愿望，尤其是每当一个国家的人民表示不愿再受剥削的决心时，帝国主义的这种罪行就层出不穷。”
    西索科谴责了帝国主义在南非、南罗得西亚、葡属殖民地和越南的罪行。
    西索科说：“帝国主义是所有人民的主要敌人，是非洲各国人民的真正罪犯。”他指出，“不管帝国主义现在和将来策划什么罪恶勾当，非洲人民必将取得胜利。”
    马里全国新闻工作者联合会三月一日发表声明说：“目前使加纳流血牺牲的军事政变是本性要独霸世界的帝国主义和国际托辣斯对非洲各国人民的独立、自由和尊严犯下的又一罪行。”
    声明说，最近在非洲连续发生的危险事件充分证明，非洲人民的敌人正在执行殖民主义复辟的恶毒计划。声明号召制止帝国主义侵略者的魔爪。
    新华社五日讯　巴马科消息：马里苏丹联盟党在总书记和共和国总统莫迪博·凯塔的主持下，一日在巴马科举行干部会议，讨论加纳政变对形势的影响。会议决定立即成立保卫革命全国委员会。
    参加这次会议的有苏丹联盟党全国政治局、政府和议会的成员以及各人民团体的负责人。
    莫迪博·凯塔总统在会上讲话说，马里和非洲必须从加纳事件中吸取教训。
    总统说，“在这个非洲的严重时刻，我们准备履行我们的职责到底。”
    他要求战士们提高警惕，来保卫马里革命。
    马里陆军参谋长塞库·特拉奥雷上校以军队的名义在会上重申，军队完全支持党、政府和国家组织。
    他说，在马里，帝国主义者及其国内外的代理人的任何勾当，将被挫败，并注定都要失败。
