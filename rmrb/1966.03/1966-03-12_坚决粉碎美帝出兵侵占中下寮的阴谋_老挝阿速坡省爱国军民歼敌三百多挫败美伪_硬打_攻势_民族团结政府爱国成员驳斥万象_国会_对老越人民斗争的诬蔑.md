    The Patriotic Military and Civilians of Attopeu Province, Laos, Annihilate Over 300 Enemies, Foiling the US-Puppet "Hard Hit" Offensive
    Patriotic Members of the National Union Government Refute Vientiane "National Assembly's" Slanders Against the Lao and Vietnamese People's Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 10th – According to Radio Pathet Lao, in the counter-attacks in the Mang Khoai One Fang Ding area of Attopeu Province, southern Laos, in late February and early March, patriotic military and civilians annihilated over 340 officers and soldiers of the US imperialists and their running dogs' puppet 16th Mobile Regiment, thwarting the enemy's so-called "hard hit" offensive. According to the radio broadcast, Khamtay Siphandone, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, wrote to the military and civilians of Attopeu Province on the 5th, commending them for this glorious victory.
    The letter stated that the victory of the military and civilians of Attopeu Province is a powerful support for the patriotic military and civilians in other parts of Laos who are fighting the US imperialists and their running dog armies, and it is also a severe warning to the US imperialists who are plotting to directly invade and occupy the central and lower Lao regions.
    Siphandone called on the military and civilians in the lower Lao region, especially the military and civilians in Attopeu Province, to bravely and ingeniously seek out the enemy and strike, winning every battle and annihilating the enemy!
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 10th – According to Radio Pathet Lao, patriotic ministers and state secretaries in the Lao National Union Government issued a statement in the liberated area on the 9th, pointing out that the US imperialists' instigation of the Vientiane "National Assembly" to pass a "resolution" on February 24 slandering the Lao people's anti-US patriotic struggle and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is part of the US imperialists' deliberate plot to further create tension in Laos and Indochina.
    The statement pointed out that the US imperialists' plot to directly send troops to invade Laos has been strongly condemned and protested by world public opinion. Therefore, it instigated its Vientiane running dogs to come forward and issue this slanderous "resolution" in order to create more excuses for realizing its plot to directly send troops to invade Laos.
    The statement said that in the face of the above-mentioned extremely serious conspiracy of the US imperialists, the patriotic members of the Lao National Union Government solemnly declare:
    1. Resolutely condemn the Vientiane "National Assembly" for passing the so-called February 24 "resolution" that distorts the Lao people's anti-US patriotic struggle and slanders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; 2. Reiterate once again: it is none other than the US imperialists and their running dogs who have seriously undermined the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question and should bear full responsibility for the current increasingly tense situation in Laos; 3. The US imperialists and their running dog group, primarily the Kouprasith-Sananikone group, will inevitably be shamefully defeated in their attempt to undermine the diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the face of the new military adventures of US imperialism, the Lao people must strengthen their combat solidarity with the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples more than ever before to oppose the common enemy.
    The statement said that the patriotic members of the National Union Government once again sternly warn the US imperialists that if they dare to risk directly sending troops to trample on Lao territory, the Lao people will, together with the people of the fraternal countries of Indochina, with the support of the people of the world, deal a fatal blow to the US aggressors and their running dogs, and completely eliminate the US imperialists and their running dogs.
    This statement was jointly issued by Prince Souphanouvong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy and Planning of the Lao National Union Government, Khamsouk Keola, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Phoumi Vongvichit, Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism, Khoun Mongkhonvilay, State Secretary for Veterans Affairs, Chao Sopsaisana, State Secretary for Public Works and Transport, and Khampheun Tounalom, State Secretary for National Economy and Planning.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 11th – Radio Pathet Lao published a commentary on the 9th, pointing out that the purpose of Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn's "visit" to Laos at the end of March is to further collude with the Vientiane reactionary group to cooperate with the US imperialists in realizing their plan to invade Laos. "The Lao people resolutely oppose Thanom's trip to Laos."
    According to the Bangkok Post of March 1, Thanom Kittikachorn will visit Laos at the end of March at the invitation of Prince Souvanna Phouma.
    The commentary pointed out that the Thai reactionary authorities have long colluded with the Lao running dog group to carry out aggressive activities against Laos. In mid-November last year, the Thai reactionary authorities dispatched two battalions of Thai troops to Savannakhet and Thakhek, and recently dispatched three companies of artillery to participate in the attack on the Lao patriotic armed forces in the Phou Kouth Mountain area of Xieng Khouang Province. This time, Thanom's attempt to collude further with Prince Souvanna Phouma in Laos is in order to take a further step on the road of following the United States in invading Laos.

    坚决粉碎美帝出兵侵占中下寮的阴谋
    老挝阿速坡省爱国军民歼敌三百多挫败美伪“硬打”攻势
    民族团结政府爱国成员驳斥万象“国会”对老越人民斗争的诬蔑
    新华社康开十日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝南部阿速坡省芒球一方钉地区爱国军民，在二月底和三月初的反击战中，消灭美帝国主义及其走狗集团伪十六机动团官兵三百四十多人，挫败了敌人的所谓“硬打”攻势。据这家电台广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表坎代·西番顿五日写信给阿速坡省军民，表扬他们取得的这一光辉战绩。
    信中说，阿速坡省军民的这一胜利是对正在打击美帝国主义及其走狗军队的老挝其他地方的爱国军民的一个有力的支持，也是对阴谋直接出兵侵占中寮和下寮地区的美帝国主义的一个严厉警告。
    西番顿号召下寮地区军民、尤其是阿速坡省军民勇敢机智地寻找敌人打，每打必胜，歼灭敌人！
    新华社康开十日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝民族团结政府中的爱国大臣和国务秘书九日在解放区发表声明指出，美帝国主义指使万象“国会”于二月二十四日通过诬蔑老挝人民反美救国斗争和越南民主共和国的“决议”，是美帝国主义蓄意进一步制造老挝和印度支那紧张局势的阴谋的组成部分。
    声明指出，美帝国主义准备直接出兵侵略老挝的阴谋遭到全世界舆论强烈谴责和抗议。因此，它便指使它的万象走狗出面发表这个充满诬蔑的“决议”，以便为实现它的直接出兵侵略老挝的阴谋制造更多的借口。
    声明说，面对着美帝国主义上述极其严重的阴谋，老挝民族团结政府中的爱国成员郑重宣布：
    一、坚决谴责万象“国会”通过歪曲老挝人民反美救国斗争和诬蔑越南民主共和国的所谓二月二十四日“决议”；二、再一次重申：严重地破坏一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议、并应对目前老挝日益紧张局势担负全部责任的不是别人，正是美帝国主义及其走狗；三、美帝国主义及其走狗集团，首先是库帕拉西—萨纳尼空集团，妄图破坏老挝王国和越南民主共和国之间的外交关系的阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。面对着美帝国主义的新的军事冒险，老挝人民比任何时候都要增强同越南人民和柬埔寨人民的战斗团结、以反对共同的敌人。
    声明说，民族团结政府中的爱国成员再一次严厉警告美帝国主义，如果它胆敢冒险直接出兵蹂躏老挝领土，老挝人民必将同印度支那各兄弟国家人民一起，在全世界人民的支持下，给美国侵略者及其走狗以致命的打击，彻底消灭美帝国主义及其走狗。
    这个声明是由老挝民族团结政府副首相兼国民经济和计划大臣苏发努冯亲王，卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉，新闻、宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希，退伍军人国务秘书昏·蒙昆维莱，公共工程和运输国务秘书昭苏·冯萨，国民经济和计划国务秘书坎芬·杜纳龙联合发表的。
    据新华社康开十一日电　巴特寮电台九日发表评论指出，泰国总理他侬·吉滴卡宗在三月底来老挝“访问”的目的，是为了进一步同万象反动集团勾结，配合美帝国主义实现它的侵略老挝的计划。“老挝人民坚决反对他侬的老挝之行。”
    据《曼谷邮报》三月一日报道，他侬·吉滴卡宗应富马亲王的邀请，将在三月底访问老挝。
    评论指出：泰国反动当局在很久以来就同老挝走狗集团勾结，对老挝进行侵略活动。泰国反动当局在去年十一月中旬，派遣两个营泰国军队进入沙湾拿吉和他曲，最近又派遣三个连炮兵参与进攻川圹省富科特山地区的老挝爱国武装力量。这次他侬到老挝企图进一步同梭发那·富马亲王进行勾结，以便在追随美国侵略老挝的道路上跨进一步。
