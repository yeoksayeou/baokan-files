    Taking a Lesson from Different Trades
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, Sun Jipeng
    When others have good work experience and advanced work methods, we should go to them humbly to ask for advice, take the "good seeds" from others, and cultivate our own "strong seedlings." This practice of learning from others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses is called "taking a lesson."
    Speaking of "taking a lesson," it is generally more common to seek out "peers" or "opponents." Generally, "peers" have similar work and are consistent in the basic laws of the movement of things. Therefore, as long as the "lesson" of a "peer" is "taken" and flexibly applied in combination with one's own situation, it will achieve immediate results.
    This "lesson-taking" method is commonly used by people in the comparison, learning, catching-up, and helping movement and has proven to be completely effective in practice. However, is "lesson-taking" limited to the same industry and the same type of work? We say that not only should we take lessons from the same industry, but we should also take lessons from different industries. Some people may say, "Different trades are like different mountains, even if you get it, it is difficult to apply!" In fact, in our country, all trades and professions have the most valuable "basic lesson"—under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, self-reliance, striving for progress, hard struggle, and building the country through diligence and thrift.
    Some factory directors and party secretaries of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, which is known as "a flower in Jiangnan," led workers, cadres, and technicians in batches and phases to visit local industrial factories and communes in the area to ask for advice. These local factories and communes neither smelt steel nor iron, nor do they produce ore or coke, but make shoes and cast pots. However, the comrades of Ma Steel found in this "basic lesson" that: running enterprises with diligence and thrift is not as good as local factories; "two innovations" are not as good as local factories, etc., which played a major role in promoting their own work.
    Judging from the results already received by Ma Steel, even if "the drummer sells candy, each doing his own thing," the "basic lesson" can still be connected. Therefore, it can be said that lessons can be "taken" from different trades.

    隔行可取经
    马鞍山钢铁公司　孙继鹏
    别人有了好的工作经验，有了先进的工作方法，就前往虚心求教，采别人之“良种”，育自己之“壮苗”。这种取人之长，补己之短的做法，叫做“取经”。
    谈到“取经”，一般是找“同行”寻“对手”的为多。大凡“同行”，工作有相似之处，在事物运动的基本规律上是一致的。因此，“同行”的“经”，只要是“取”到了手，结合本身情况加以灵活运用，都会取得立竿见影的效果。
    这种“取经”方式，是人们在比学赶帮超运动中所惯用的，实践证明是完全行之有效的。但是，“取经”是否只限于同行业、同工种呢？我们说不仅同行的“经”要取，非同行的“经”也要取。也许有人会说：“隔行如隔山，即便取到了手，也难以应用呀！”其实在咱们国家里，千行百业都有本最可贵的“基本经”——在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的革命精神。
    被誉为“江南一枝花”的马鞍山钢铁公司的一些厂矿的厂长、党委书记，带领着工人、干部、技术人员，分批分期地到所在地区的地方工业厂、社登门求教。这些地方厂、社，既不炼钢、炼铁，也不出矿、出焦，而是制鞋、铸锅的。但是马钢的同志，却在这本“基本经”里，找出了：勤俭办企业不如地方厂；“双革”不如地方厂等十条差距，对推动本身工作起了重大作用。
    从马钢已经收到的效果来看，即使是“打锣卖糖各干一行”，但“基本经”还是可以一脉相通的。所以说隔行可“取经”。
