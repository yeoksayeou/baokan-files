    Learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts
    Without conducting investigation and research on a certain task, it is impossible to truly solve problems; to solve difficult problems in work, one must, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be meticulous, conduct investigation and research, and never give up until the truth is known.
    Shen County's northern region is often subjected to wind and sand disasters, while the southeastern region is mostly saline-alkali land, resulting in a very low level of production. I came to work in Shen County in 1961. How could the impoverished state of this area be changed? What fundamental aspects should be addressed? It was not until the autumn of 1964 that I realized that without eliminating the three major disasters of "drought, flooding, and alkali," changing the impoverished state of Shen County would merely be empty talk. After identifying this root cause, considerable work was done, but the results were not significant enough. What was the reason? After reading Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I was shocked. Whether in terms of ideological style or work style, there was a significant gap between myself and Comrade Jiao Yulu, especially in the spirit of seeking truth from facts.
    During last year's fight against drought, several communes in the northern region wanted to dig wells, but because the Hutuo River had rolled back and forth in this area seventy or eighty years ago, it had accumulated many sandy ridges, making it difficult to dig canals and wells. Furthermore, the commune and team cadres were only willing to dig mechanized wells and cone wells, and were unwilling to dig brick wells. We had repeatedly told these comrades that under the current circumstances, engaging in "small-scale indigenous projects" was the main way to solve the county's water source problem, and had organized them to visit communes that had already achieved success. However, they said, "This method is indeed feasible, but the ground here is bottomless quicksand, making it impossible to build them!" Thus, the inability to build brick wells in the northern region became a consensus among most leading cadres and grassroots cadres.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "Eating food that others have already chewed has no flavor." This sentence gave me great inspiration. Wasn't it just the office and some commune and team cadres who said that brick wells could not be built in the northern part of the county? Without conducting my own investigation and research, I believed it to be true. Wasn't this precisely "eating food that others have already chewed"? Thinking of this, I made up my mind to resolutely investigate and experiment, and to personally taste the soil and water there.
    On the afternoon of February 16th, I took the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and newspapers reporting Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, and tied a newly purchased iron shovel to my bicycle to go to the Xiwu Village Brigade of the Bingcao Commune to understand whether it was possible to dig brick wells. In the evening, I invited several old poor peasants and veteran Party members for a discussion. They said that canal water was not available, digging mechanized wells was expensive and slow, and digging brick wells was quick, but not feasible. Veteran Party member Wei Fengxiang said, "In 1957, more than twenty brick wells were dug, but in a short time, the sand at the bottom silted up the wells by several feet, and soon they became dry wells. Afterwards, people never mentioned digging brick wells again." At that time, only about ten feet deep was dug, what if dig deeper? Everyone was not sure. At night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Was it really impossible to build brick wells here? Chairman Mao taught us, "No investigation, no right to speak," and "Man's correct ideas can only come from social practice." Chairman Mao's words seemed to light a bright lamp in my heart. I thought: In solving the problem of digging wells, holding symposiums is the first step in investigation, and also only one way, whether it is feasible or not, you have to do it yourself, see it for yourself.
    The next morning, Wei Fengxiang, poor peasant commune members Qiao Zhanmin, and Shang Baocang and I dug earth wells in the northwest of the village to explore the underground soil layers. When we dug to a depth of more than nine feet, quicksand appeared as expected. Digging another two feet deeper, the surrounding mud and sand collapsed directly downward. The commune members Jin Qiling and Zhang Shanbao who were present said: "When so many wells were dug in 1957, they were all like this, the quicksand layer has no bottom." At this time, everyone was a little discouraged. I said to continue digging, but I had no confidence in my heart.
    After lunch, I read the article "The Example of the County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu" again. When I read that Comrade Jiao Yulu often traveled tirelessly in the wind and rain in order to find out the origin and course of a large wind gap and a main river channel, I blamed myself for hesitating. Chairman Mao taught us: "We should be honest in everything we do; if we want to accomplish a few things in the world, an honest attitude is essential." I made up my mind to never give up until I got to the bottom of the matter. I carried a bamboo pole more than seven feet long, and Wei Fengxiang and others hitched up a cart to haul wooden stakes and sorghum stalks to the construction site. After digging out the mud and sand that had collapsed in the morning, Shang Baocang picked up the bamboo pole and plunged it downward, leaving only a little over a foot of the seven-foot-long bamboo pole. When plunging it down, it was very easy below the foot, but when it reached three feet, it became difficult again. Wei Fengxiang said: "The soil layer below must be different!" I picked up the bamboo pole covered with muddy water and saw that the top one foot of the section was yellowish-brown and had very little mud, while the lower half was covered with thick, black mud. The problem of different soil qualities became clear. We continued to dig, and after digging through more than two feet of black clay layer, it was sand. I quickly grabbed a handful of sand, and saw that this layer of sand was coarser than the upper layer of sand, and I tasted the water and it was very sweet. Qiao Zhanmin quickly dug a few more shovels, and four or five small springs were gushing out of a small pit one foot square. When the bamboo pole was plunged down, it was easy to penetrate below four feet. Everyone was happy, because the water source was strong and the water was good, and a clay layer was found. In order to more fully understand the underground soil conditions, the next day we conducted a second experiment at a higher location more than two hundred meters northwest of this experimental point. The results proved that both experimental points had a very thick clay layer at a depth of about eighteen or nineteen feet. Wei Fengxiang said happily: "The failure to successfully dig so many brick wells in 1957 was because we did not dig to the bottom, thanks to our experiment that we found the clay layer, now I don't believe anyone who says that brick wells cannot be dug here."
    Currently, this brigade has formulated a plan to dig twenty brick wells, and has prepared the materials and started construction.
    During the two days of labor and experimentation, I sweated a lot, and my hands, face, and clothes were covered with mud, but I felt indescribably happy in my heart. Because the myth that there is no bottom to the quicksand here was shattered by facts.
    From this experiment, I deeply realized that: The attitude of seeking truth from facts is the prerequisite for solving difficult problems. To truly learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's high degree of scientific and realistic spirit, we must first learn his thorough revolutionary spirit of meticulously investigating and researching according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and not giving up until the truth is known.

### 把焦裕禄同志的求实精神学到手

    把焦裕禄同志的求实精神学到手
    对某种工作，自己不调查研究，就不可能真正解决问题；要解决工作中的疑难问题，就必须象焦裕禄同志那样，遵照毛主席教导，一丝不苟，调查研究，不得真知，决不罢休
    深县北部常遭风沙灾害，东南部多是盐碱地，生产水平很低。一九六一年我来到深县工作。怎样改变这里的贫困面貌呢？从根本上抓些什么呢？一直到一九六四年秋才认识到，不除掉“旱、涝、碱”三大灾害，要改变深县贫困面貌，那只是纸上谈兵。找到这个根源以后，曾作了不少工作，但成效不够显著。原因在哪里？读了焦裕禄同志的事迹以后，才大吃一惊，不论在思想作风或工作作风方面，自己与焦裕禄同志都有很大差距，特别是在求实精神方面差距更大。
    在去年的抗旱斗争中，北部几个公社想打井，但因七八十年以前滹沱河在这一带滚来滚去，淤积了很多沙岗，开渠挖井有不少的困难。社、队干部又只愿打机井和锥井，不愿意打砖井。我们曾对这些同志一再讲：在目前情况下搞“小土群”是解决我县水源问题的主要办法，并几次组织他们到已经搞出成效的公社参观。他们却说：“这个法倒是行，但我们这里地下是无底的流沙走泥，实在搞不成呀！”这样，北部地区不能搞砖井成了多数领导干部和基层干部的一致说法。
    焦裕禄同志说：“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道。”这句话给了我极大的启示：我县北部不能搞砖井，这不只是办公室和一些社队干部说的吗？自己不调查研究，信以为真，这不正是“吃别人嚼过的馍”吗？想到这里，我下了决心，坚决去调查实验一番，亲口尝一尝那里的水土。
    二月十六日下午，我带着《毛泽东选集》和报道焦裕禄同志事迹的报纸，并把新买的铁锨捆在自行车上，到兵曹公社西午村大队，了解能不能挖砖井的问题。晚上，我请来几位老贫农、老党员座谈。他们说，渠水用不上，打机井既费钱又来得慢，搞砖井倒是快当，但是弄不成。老党员魏凤祥说：“一九五七年挖了二十多眼砖井，时间不长，底下冒的沙把井淤了好几尺，不久就成了旱井。以后，人们再也不提挖砖井的事了。”那时，只挖一丈多深，若再深挖怎么样呢？大家都不清楚。夜里，我翻来复去睡不好觉。这里搞砖井就真的不行吗？毛主席教导我们：“没有调查就没有发言权”，“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来”。毛主席的话好象在我心里点上了明灯。我想：在解决挖井问题上，开座谈会是调查的第一步，也只是一种方式，是行是不行，还得亲手干干，亲眼看个究竟。
    第二天上午，我和魏凤祥、贫农社员乔占民、尚宝仓在村西北挖土井，探地下土层的情况。挖到九尺多深的地方，果然出现了流沙走泥。再挖下二尺来深，四周的泥沙直往下塌。在场的社员靳其领和张山宝说：“一九五七年挖那么多井，都是这样，流沙层没有底。”这时，大家有点泄劲。我嘴里说接着挖，可是心里一点底也没有。
    中午饭后，再一次读《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》一文，当读到焦裕禄同志为了弄清一个大风口，一条主干河道的来龙去脉，经常不辞劳苦地在风雨中奔波的时候，我就责备自己不该犹豫。毛主席教导我们：“我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”我下定决心，不弄个水落石出决不罢休。我扛着一根七尺多长的竹竿，和魏凤祥等，套车拉着木桩、秫秸，赶到工地。挖出了上午塌下的泥沙后，尚宝仓拿起竹竿向下扎，七尺多长的竹竿剩下一尺多。往下扎的时候，一尺多以下很省劲，到三尺多的时候就又吃力了。魏凤祥说：“下面的土层准是不一样！”我拿起粘着泥水的竹竿一看，上头一尺多的一节是土黄色，粘泥很少，下半截粘的泥厚厚的，是黑色。土质不同的问题清楚了。我们继续挖，挖了二尺多黑粘土层就是沙。我赶忙抓起一把沙，一看这层沙比上层沙粒粗，又尝了尝水很甜，乔占民又紧挖几锨，一个一尺见方的小坑就有四、五个小泉往上冒水。用竹竿往下一扎，四尺多下面又扎着省劲了。大伙都乐了，因为水源壮水又好，又找到了胶泥层。为了更全面地了解地下土层情况，第二天我们又在这个实验点西北二百多米的地势较高的地方搞第二次实验。结果证明：两个实验点都在一丈八九尺深的地方有很厚的胶泥层。魏凤祥高兴地说：“一九五七年挖那么多砖井不成功，就是因为没有挖到底道，多亏我们搞实验才找到了胶泥层，现在谁说这里不能挖砖井我也不信了”。
    目前这个大队订出了挖二十眼砖井的计划，并已备好了料，动了工。
    两天的劳动实验，我流了很多汗，手脸和衣服上粘了不少泥土，但心里却有说不出的高兴。因为这一带流沙走泥没有底的神话被事实戳破了。
    从这次实验里，我深深体会到：寻根求源的求实态度是解决疑难问题的前提。要真正把焦裕禄同志那种高度的科学的求实精神学到手，首先必须学习他遵照毛主席教导，一丝不苟，调查研究，不得真知不罢休的彻底革命精神。
