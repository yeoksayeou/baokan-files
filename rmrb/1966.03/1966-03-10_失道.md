    Losing the Way
    American Ambassador to the United Nations, Goldberg, listed a batch of New Zealand, Australian, and South Korean mercenary troops in the American war of aggression against Vietnam, in order to prove that the United States was not "fighting alone." He also said that even if the United States was fighting alone, this "would not necessarily be conclusive evidence of a country's injustice and depravity."
    Fighting alone is indeed not the only evidence of waging an unjust war. However, as the saying goes, "He who loses popular support finds few supporters." Waging an unjust war inevitably fails to gain the support of the people of various countries. It is precisely because the Johnson government is conducting an unjust war of aggression in South Vietnam that it has plunged itself into extreme isolation. It has exhausted its efforts to rope in a few accomplices, but it cannot strengthen its momentum or conceal the injustice and depravity of American imperialism.

    失道
    美国驻联合国大使戈德堡列举了美国在侵越战争中有一批新西兰、澳大利亚和南朝鲜帮凶军，以证明美国并非“孤军作战”。他还说，即使美国是孤军作战，这也“并不一定是一个国家不义和堕落的确凿证据”。
    孤军作战的确不是进行非正义战争的唯一证据。但是，俗话说“失道者寡助”。进行不义之战，必然是得不到各国人民支持的。约翰逊政府正是因为它在南越进行一场非正义的侵略战争，才使自己陷于极端的孤立。它费尽力气，拉上几个帮凶，也壮不了声势，掩饰不了美帝国主义的不义和堕落。
