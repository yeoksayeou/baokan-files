    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 11th -- Conakry Radio announced on the evening of the 10th that Guinean President Sékou Touré said at a women's rally in Conakry on the 7th that Guinea would send troops to fight in Ghana to help the Ghanaian people liberate themselves from the dictatorial rule of military traitors.

    President Touré said that Guinea would send troops and military personnel recruited from women and youth, "which is not surprising, because it involves the freedom and dignity of Africa." Touré emphasized that everyone knows that Guinea, Ghana, and Mali constitutionally established a union a few years ago, so fighting in Ghana is like fighting on our own land.

    Touré pointed out that Guinea is not isolated. He called on the Guinean people to remain firm and vigilant in action.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 11th -- The Supreme Revolutionary Council of Congo (Léopoldville) expressed its support for Ghanaian President Nkrumah on the 11th and condemned imperialism for orchestrating the military coup in Ghana.

    Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Revolutionary Council of Congo (Léopoldville) Kabila and General Secretary Yumbu said in a telegram to Guinean President Touré, "The conspiracy achieved in Ghana through a military coup is merely a harbinger of the demise of imperialism in Africa and will in no way stop the mighty torrent of Ghanaian and African people determined to strive for the complete liberation of Africa."

    The telegram emphasized, "The revolutionary forces of Africa should strengthen unity more than ever before in order to wage a tenacious struggle against the reactionary forces that serve imperialism and humiliate our people."

    The Supreme Revolutionary Council expressed its support for the position taken by the Guinean President and people on the Ghana issue.

    Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, March 11th -- The Somali Youth League, the ruling party of Somalia, as well as the Somali Student Union and the Somali Democratic Union, issued statements on the 11th pointing out that imperialism colluded with all reactionaries to orchestrate the coup in Ghana, with the aim of paralyzing the African national liberation movement, erasing the national achievements made by the people, and making the country abandon its independent foreign policy and become a docile tool of imperialism.

    The statement said: This coup orchestrated by imperialism "is aimed at genuine patriotic workers, peasants, youth and all progressive forces." The statement said: The Somali Youth League and the Somali Student Union support Ghanaian President Nkrumah and his government, sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Ghanaian people to restore peace and democracy, and fully believe that this struggle will be victorious.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, March 11th -- The Tanganyika African National Union's newspaper *The Nationalist* published a commentary on the 11th saying that the military coup in Ghana orchestrated by imperialism had become "a spark that ignited the anti-imperialist flame in Africa."

    The commentary emphasized that the current imperialist offensive in Africa is merely its "last struggle," and they will inevitably lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet.

    The commentary continued: On the surface, imperialism seems to have won a victory, but "imperialists have exposed their masks through their own actions, and everyone can see that it is a naked fox. The struggle in Africa has entered a new stage, a more resolute and determined stage, and this struggle will surely lead us to final victory."

    Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, March 10th -- The Malian *Development Newspaper* published an article on the 10th, condemning imperialism and neo-colonialism for carrying out heinous activities in Africa, attempting to regain the ground lost as a result of the national independence won by most parts of Africa. The article emphasized, "Their attempt will inevitably fail."

    The article pointed out that the imperialist and neo-colonialist offensive against Africa will inevitably awaken all African people, preparing them to fight and block their channels for plundering African wealth.

    The article said that imperialists also talk about "democracy," but it is actually the democracy of speculators, the freedom to exploit others in order to establish financial oligarchies everywhere.

    The article pointed out that the African people have now analyzed all these phenomena and truly recognize that imperialism is attempting to deprive Africa of its personality and hinder the progress of the African continent. The article said, "This attempt by imperialism will inevitably be defeated."

    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the National Executive Committee of the General Union of Congolese (Brazzaville) Students issued a communiqué on the 10th pointing out that the recent coup in Ghana "is clearly reactionary and is the result of a conspiracy planned by American and British imperialists."

    The communiqué pointed out that the pro-imperialist coup has intensified the current struggle in Africa, but this is only a "concrete manifestation of imperialism's death throes."

    Sudan's *New Sudan News* commented on the Ghanaian coup on the 10th, saying that it is already very clear that the coup was orchestrated behind the scenes by Britain and the United States.

    The newspaper emphasized that all African people and free African countries oppose this reactionary coup. It is the responsibility of all free forces to oppose this conspiracy and thwart it.

    非洲舆论指出非洲人民斗争已进入新的阶段
    帝国主义挡不住非洲人民争取彻底的解放
    刚果（利）革命最高委员会谴责帝国主义策动加纳军事政变
    新华社科纳克里十一日电　科纳克里电台十日晚宣布，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔七日在科纳克里举行的一次妇女集会上讲话时说，几内亚将派军人去加纳作战，以便帮助加纳人民从军人叛徒的独裁统治下解放出来。
    杜尔总统说，几内亚要派出军人和从妇女和青年中招募的军事人员，“这并不奇怪，因为这牵涉到非洲的自由和尊严”。杜尔强调说，任何人都知道，几内亚、加纳和马里在几年前已经通过宪法手续建立了一个联盟，因此我们在加纳作战就是在我们自己的土地上作战。
    杜尔指出，几内亚并不是孤立的。他号召几内亚人民在行动中保持坚定和警惕。
    新华社开罗十一日电　刚果（利）革命最高委员会十一日表示支持加纳总统恩克鲁玛，谴责帝国主义在加纳策动军事政变。
    刚果（利）革命最高委员会副主席卡比拉和总书记尤姆布在打给几内亚总统杜尔的电报中说，“通过军事政变在加纳所实现的阴谋，只不过是帝国主义在非洲完蛋的预兆，丝毫阻挡不了决心争取非洲彻底解放的加纳和非洲人民力量的洪流。”
    电报强调指出，“非洲的革命队伍比以往任何时候更应该加强团结，以便对为帝国主义效劳而使我们的人民蒙受侮辱的反动势力进行顽强的斗争。”
    革命最高委员会表示支持几内亚总统和人民在加纳问题上采取的立场。
    新华社摩加迪沙十一日电　索马里执政党索马里青年联盟以及索马里学生联盟和索马里民主联盟十一日发表声明指出，帝国主义同一切反动派勾结一起策动加纳政变，目的是要使非洲的民族解放运动瘫痪，勾消人民取得的民族成果，使这个国家抛弃独立的外交政策，成为帝国主义的驯服工具。
    声明说：这次由帝国主义策动的政变“矛头是针对真正的爱国工人、农民和青年以及全体进步力量的”。声明说：索马里青年联盟和索马里学生联盟支持加纳总统恩克鲁玛和他的政府，同情和支持加纳人民为恢复和平和民主而进行的正义斗争，并且完全相信，这个斗争一定会获胜。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十一日电　坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟机关报《民族主义者报》十一日发表评论说，帝国主义策动的加纳军事政变成了“点起非洲反帝烈火的一个火花。”
    评论强调说：目前帝国主义在非洲的进攻只不过是它的“最后挣扎”而已，它们必将搬起石头打自己的脚。
    评论接着说：从表面上看，帝国主义似乎取得了一次胜利，但是，“帝国主义者通过他们自己的行动揭露了自己的假面具，大家都看得见那是一只赤裸裸的狐狸。非洲的斗争进入了一个新阶段，一个更加坚决更加毅然决然的阶段，这个斗争必定是我们赢得最后的胜利。”
    新华社巴马科十日电　马里《发展报》十日发表文章，谴责帝国主义和新殖民主义在非洲进行罪恶的活动，企图重新取得由于非洲大部分地区赢得民族独立而丧失的地盘。文章强调指出，“他们的这种企图必将失败。”
    文章指出，帝国主义和新殖民主义对非洲的进攻，必然使所有的非洲人民觉悟起来，准备战斗，堵塞它们掠夺非洲财富的通道。
    文章说，帝国主义者也侈谈什么“民主”，但它实际上是投机者的民主，是剥削别人以便到处建立财政寡头制度的自由。
    文章指出，非洲人民现在对所有这些现象作了分析，并且真正认识到，帝国主义企图剥夺非洲的人格，阻碍非洲大陆的前进。文章说，“帝国主义的这种企图必将遭到失败”。
    据新华社十一日讯　刚果（布）学生总联合会全国执行委员会十日发表一项公报指出最近在加纳发生的政变“显然是反动的，并且是美英帝国主义者策划阴谋的结果。”
    公报指出，亲帝国主义的政变加剧了非洲目前的斗争，但这只是“帝国主义垂死挣扎的具体表现。”
    苏丹《新苏丹报》十日评论加纳政变时说，事情已经很清楚，这次政变是英国和美国在幕后策划的。
    报纸强调说，全体非洲人民和非洲的自由国家都反对这次反动政变。反对这个阴谋并挫败它，是一切自由力量的责任。
