Edition: 6

    Abstract: Based on several case judgments by Hai Rui, he primarily exonerated landlords and local bullies. Whether a "clean official's" judgment is fair cannot be measured by feudal laws, nor can his merits and demerits be judged by suppressing individual despots. The so-called "strict enforcement of the law" by "clean officials" created a deceptive effect of the "sanctity" of feudal laws. The "legal" and "illegal" behaviors of the exploiting classes are often difficult to distinguish, and we cannot separate or even oppose the rights superficially granted to the landlord class to exploit and oppress peasants in feudal laws from the rights that the landlord class exceeded as prescribed.

    Feudal scholar-officials and bourgeois literati generally believe that the so-called "clean officials" in feudal society have the characteristics of "selfless integrity," "fearlessness of the powerful," and "concern for the people's suffering" in their actions. In particular, the so-called "reversal of unjust verdicts" is most likely to mislead people. It seems that Comrade Wu Han understood the mystery, so his play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" begins with "reversing unjust verdicts." Therefore, we would also like to discuss this issue.

    What "Unjust Verdicts" Did Hai Rui Reverse?

    In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "On Hai Rui," Comrade Wu Han repeatedly praised Hai Rui: "He personally tried cases, handled many backlog cases, and redressed many unjust verdicts. In cases of lawsuits between peasants and landlords, he sided with the peasants. Magistrate Hai and Grand Coordinator Hai were saviors for the oppressed, bullied, and wronged people at the time." Hai Rui's life was "a life of standing on the side of peasants and citizens to fight against feudal bureaucrats and large landlords."

    After checking, we believe that Comrade Wu Han's conclusions are completely unfounded.

    Hai Rui only left eight cases in which he was entrusted to participate in trials during his tenure as magistrate of Chun'an and Xingguo (see "Collected Works of Hai Rui"). Among these eight cases, six were homicide cases: (1) The hired worker Wu Jixiang guarded the firewood mountain for the landlord Wu Xiang and beat to death Wu Lan, who "stole firewood on the mountain." Wu Lan's son, Wu Yun, accused Wu Xiang of instigating the murder. (2) The maid Qingxiang of the landlord's wife, Wu A'yi, was injured by Wu Wan, the cousin of Wu's husband, and died soon after. Wu Wan claimed that Yi poisoned Qingxiang to frame him, while Yi claimed that Wu Wan poisoned her in an attempt to escape. (3) Hu Shengrong and Hu Shengzu brothers were fighting over a mountain with Shao Shizhong. Shengzu died of illness, and Shengrong falsely claimed that Shao beat him to death. (4) Shao Shouyu accidentally killed his cousin Shao Shouzheng, who came to steal fish from his fish pond at night, and was accused of revenge killing. (5) Xu Ji asked his brother-in-law Dai Wusun for a debt, and "the two quarreled" and beat Dai to death. Someone falsely accused Dai's wife, Xu, of having an affair with the village head, Pan Tianqi, and colluding with her brother and lover to commit the murder. (6) The landlord Chen Shunxing accused another evil landlord, Zeng Keying, of beating his hired worker Li Fuxing to death, but Zeng refused to accept the charge.

    Among the above six cases, although the first, second, and sixth cases involved disputes between the working people and landlords, after Hai Rui "carefully reviewed the words of the crowd" and clarified "the truth of the matter," he "reversed the verdicts" for the landlords Wu Xiang, landlord's wife Yi, and even the "rich and evil landlord" Zeng Keying. In contrast, for the hired worker Wu Jixiang, who committed homicide while guarding the firewood mountain for his master, he ordered him to bear full responsibility and upheld the original "death penalty" verdict. In addition to these six homicide cases, the remaining two cases were: one involved disputes over graves among members of the He surname clan, which was purely an internal dispute among property owners; the other was that the poor people Fang Cong and Fang Tianyu both borrowed grain from the landlord He Mengdun due to food shortages during the famine year. Because He did not fulfill the contract and only lent Fang Tianyu less than half of the rice, Fang Tianyu and Fang Cong had a dispute and accused each other of omissions. The original instigator of the latter case was the landlord He Mengdun, but Hai Rui, during the trial, cited He's reason that "the grain has been consumed over time" and believed that "the fault is not with Mengdun," and did not even condemn him.

    Judging from the above eight cases, Hai Rui only "reversed the verdicts" for a few landlords and evil bullies, and also exonerated a landlord. It is impossible to talk about "standing on the side of the peasants."

    Regarding the materials on Hai Rui's judgments, there is also "The Official Case Records of Mr. Hai Gangfeng," compiled and prefaced by Li Chunfang. Although its publication (1606) was not far from Hai Rui's death (1587), it is basically a public case novel that relies on and promotes Hai Rui. This public case record is divided into seventy-one episodes, collecting seventy-six cases ①. Many of the materials are taken from Song and Yuan vernacular stories and public case stories that were already popular among the people during Hai Rui's lifetime, but it also refers to some judicial trial materials, which may contain Hai Rui's own things. The seventy-six cases it contains can be divided into: twenty-nine cases of rape, adultery, especially rape and murder, fourteen cases of murder for money, twelve cases of family, marriage, and property disputes, eight cases of false accusation or slander, and seven cases of robbery, theft, and fraud. In addition, there are two cases of beating people to death due to debt collection, one case of treason, one case of occupying someone else's wife, one case of fighting over water, and one case of monkey spirit haunting. From the perspective of class relations, most of them are cases of licentiousness, intrigue, and mutual slaughter among the exploiting classes such as landlords, bureaucrats, and big merchants. There are only twenty-five cases that more clearly involve the exploiting classes and the laboring people and small merchants. Among them, twenty cases belong to the resistance and sabotage of the feudal system and order by the working people and other ruled people. Hai Rui strictly maintained the feudal system and protected the personal and property safety of the landlords, and cruelly suppressed and punished them. For example, in the thirty-sixth episode, Fu Shizhi, Zhu Ruzhang, and hundreds of others in the suburbs of Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, "planned to start a major event." After being reported, Hai Rui immediately carried out a large-scale search and arrest and sentenced "Fu Shizhi, Zhu Ruzhang, and ten others to be beheaded without delay, and the rest were sentenced to death as followers," which is a more typical example. The remaining five cases are two cases of landlords forcing debts and beating poor people or their families to death, two cases of deliberately killing their servants and framing others, and one case of relying on power to occupy someone else's wife and frame her husband. In short, they are all cases of landlords committing heinous crimes to persecute the people. However, Hai Rui treated such heinous crimes as leniently as possible, as long as he had an excuse to exonerate them. For example, in the seventh episode, Wang Aili, a "ferocious tyrant" who was "unkind to the rich, exploited the people to enrich himself," and "poisoned one side," went to the home of the poor Hu Jinbao to force debts and injured Jinbao's mother, causing her to die soon after. However, he bit back and falsely claimed that he was injured by Jinbao. He was summoned seven times but did not appear in court. As a result, Hai Rui only let Wang Aili pay for the funeral on the grounds of "accidental," "injury by mistake," and "not what he intended," and did not pursue the matter. Although the remaining four cases were handled, two of the cases of master killing slaves were mainly sentenced because the criminals framed the other two landlords and were exposed. There are only two cases that can truly be said to have restrained the illegal infringement of the poor people by the powerful. One is the local tyrant Shen Yisen, who beat the poor He Zhongsheng to death for forcing debts and falsely accused He Zhongsheng of stealing. The other is Luo Kexian, the son of an official family, who was rampant in the countryside and raped other people's wives and daughters. He occupied the wife of the poor Long Decai, but bribed the county official to falsely accuse Long Decai of abduction and sentenced Long Decai to many years in prison. In these two cases, Hai Rui had to punish them separately on the grounds of "improper behavior" and "actually violating the law" due to the difficulty of resisting public anger.

    In this public case record, although the compilers embellished two cases of cracking down on the powerful, from the overall point of view of the above twenty-five cases, the basic point that Hai Rui acted as a tool of the landlord class's dictatorship and used feudal laws to suppress the resistance of peasants and other ruled people is obvious. Although it is a novel that has been "artistically exaggerated" by feudal literati, the problems it reflects are closer to historical truth than the conclusions made by Comrade Wu Han.

            What is the Essence of "Reversing Unjust Verdicts"?

      "Unjust verdict" is a legal concept. Its meaning is: when hearing a case, the judge judges the innocent as guilty, connives at, condones, and shields the guilty, so that the victims are wronged and cannot be redressed. In feudal society, there are many reasons for unjust verdicts, but the main ones are two situations: one is that the presiding officials intentionally create them due to flattering the powerful, currying favor with dignitaries, or accepting bribes; the other is that they are caused by subjective assumptions and biased listening based on standing on the side of the exploiting class. Especially in cases involving peasants, in that dark feudal rule where no officials are not corrupt, no officials are not dirty, and suppressing peasants is the primary goal, and extracting confessions by torture is the characteristic of trials, there is no prison that is not unjust. In the entire feudal society, the so-called "unjust verdicts" are countless. Precisely because of this, occasionally a so-called "clean official" can clearly judge three or two public cases or redress one or two unjust verdicts. After being rendered and beautified by feudal literati, it can play the role of paralyzing the people.

    But can we, like Comrade Wu Han, think that "clean officials" are "fair and selfless" or even "stand on the side of the peasants"? No. First of all, the judgments of "clean officials" are based on feudal laws, and feudal laws are the expression of the will of the feudal rulers. The feudal rulers even do not hide this point. Ancient Chinese jurists said: "Establish criminal law to deter those below, those below fear those above, so the ruler has something to govern them." ② Therefore, we cannot simply look at whether the trial is fair from a legal form, and cannot simply look at whether it is a crime or not from legal provisions. That is to say, we cannot think that what is legal is reasonable and just, and what is illegal is wrong, is a crime, but must analyze its social nature and class content. Otherwise, it is tantamount to admitting that feudal laws are also reasonable and just for peasants. In this way, it will inevitably lead to praising feudal laws themselves and their legislators, thereby affirming the feudal exploitation system.

    Secondly, the so-called "clearly judging public cases" and "reversing unjust verdicts," even if they crack down on individual corrupt officials and evil tyrants, cannot be said to "represent the interests of the peasants" and "stand on the side of the peasants." Because since the law is the expression of the will of the entire ruling class, it not only protects the personal interests of its members, but more importantly, protects the overall and long-term interests of its class. To this end, while suppressing peasants, it is also necessary to restrain the behavior of its internal groups and members that damage its overall and long-term interests. "Clearly judging public cases" and "reversing unjust verdicts" have always been needed by the feudal rulers and included in their laws. In China's feudal society, which lasted for thousands of years, since the establishment of the Qin and Han central authoritarian monarchical system, dynasties of all ages, in order to maintain and consolidate the unified state power in order to more effectively rule and suppress peasants, have repeatedly promulgated decrees to crack down on and suppress local separatist forces. At the same time, in order to alleviate internal contradictions and class contradictions and decorate the facade, they would also sanction some too outrageous corrupt officials and powerful tyrants when necessary. Taking the Ming Dynasty as an example, starting from Zhu Yuanzhang, almost every emperor has never broken such edicts: "All crimes shall be judged according to the Ming Law, and the law department shall not be allowed to be profound," "Questioning crimes is based on the Ming Law, and no deep and unjust abuse is allowed." ③ Sometimes officials who cause unjust verdicts are also punished. Zhu Yuanzhang once ordered: "All judicial inquiries of prisoners must be based on the law and detailed reasoning, and must not be illegally tortured and forged into prison, and those who violate it will be investigated and punished." ④ Even during the Jiajing period, although class contradictions were very sharp, the rulers still "ordered the law department to question and manage lawsuits, must distinguish right from wrong, and judge from a 'public' place, so that people have no grievances." ⑤ However, the purpose of all these practices by the feudal rulers is nothing more than to maintain a large unjust verdict under the whole world. Because the feudal exploitation system protected by the feudal state and law is a dark and unjust verdict for peasants and other working people. All the sufferings of the peasants arise from this. And all the officials of the feudal state are tools for guarding this unjust verdict. Hai Rui, based on his class instinct, also noticed this. Didn't he say that if he didn't maintain the law and discipline and abide by the ancestral precepts, and made the "discipline exhausted," it would lead to "great chaos in the world"?

    Not only that, but "clean officials" reversing such "unjust verdicts" can also play such a role: adding a circle of light that "no one is allowed to infringe" on the "three-foot imperial law" and the "golden rules and jade laws" of the feudal emperor, thereby showing its "sanctity" in order to more effectively suppress the peasants. Engels once talked about why the British bourgeoisie regarded bourgeois law as sacred. He said: "For the bourgeois, the law is of course sacred, because the law was originally created by the bourgeois, was promulgated with his consent and for the protection of him and his interests. The bourgeois understands that even if individual legal provisions are inconvenient for him, the entire legislation is ultimately used to protect his interests, and the most important thing is that the sanctity of the law, the inviolability of the order determined by a part of society actively according to their own will and passively accepted by another part, is the most reliable pillar of his social status." ⑥ Engels' analysis also applies to feudal law. The "clean officials" "enforcing the law like a mountain" made the "sanctity" of feudal law produce a confusing effect, especially when this "sanctity" has been trampled by themselves into an indecent shape. In this regard, "clean officials" have indeed played a role that corrupt officials cannot play. They are "both good at understanding the common interests of their class and very clever at maintaining these class interests."

            The Role of "Reversing Unjust Verdicts" Should Not Be Exaggerated

    Comrade Wu Han not only seriously distorts the essence of the "reversal of unjust verdicts" of clean officials, but also greatly exceeds the feudal literati in exaggerating the role of "reversing unjust verdicts" of "clean officials."

    We believe that under certain historical conditions, some officials, starting from consolidating feudal rule, curbed the atrocities of some corrupt officials and evil tyrants, but the role they can play in this regard is very limited and does not promote the development of the entire history. But in Comrade Wu Han's writing, it seems that as long as "clean officials" like Hai Rui sacrifice this "three-foot imperial law," any problem can be solved, and even a "utopia" can be created for the peasants. This can only be a deception to the world. On the contrary, Hai Rui is an expert in executing the "three-foot imperial law" in suppressing peasants and creating unjust verdicts, but he often fails in limiting the atrocities of internal members.

    Here, we must first break a concept, that is, to clearly divide the rights superficially given to the landlord class in feudal laws from the rights enjoyed by the landlord class beyond the regulations, and even oppose them. In fact, in feudal society, there is no insurmountable gap between the two. This is because:

    First, feudal law itself is unequal in form, it is an open law of privilege. Marx said: "In the Middle Ages, every form of right, freedom, and social existence was expressed as a privilege." ⑦ In our feudal society, from the pre-Qin "punishments do not apply to officials, and rituals do not apply to common people," to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the old tradition of "the law can be enforced on common people, but cannot be practiced on local officials" has always been implemented. The so-called "princes commit crimes and are punished the same as common people" is just a deafening lie. The feudal codes of all dynasties, such as the famous Tang and Ming laws, granted landlords and bureaucrats various privileges, and even the right to arbitrarily scold and kill peasants. For example, the Ming Law stipulates that it is legal for parents to scold slaves and hired workers, and there is no crime in falsely accusing slaves and hired workers, "there is no crime in beating slaves and hired workers to death," "beating hired workers is not considered if it does not cause injury, and if it causes injury, it is reduced by three grades compared to ordinary people," and there is no crime in "accidental" killing of slaves and hired workers. The so-called "accident" here is just a pretext to exonerate them. And great nobles, great bureaucrats, and large landlords also enjoyed the long-standing so-called "eight discussions" ⑧ in litigation. The Ming Chengzu even stipulated that the salary of meritorious officials could offset one, two, or even three death sentences ⑨. In addition to these "legal rights," if they still need to be punished, they have a guarantee, that is, to redeem their crimes with money. The Tang and Ming laws stipulate that except for the ten evil crimes, as long as there is money, from whipping ten times to the death penalty can be redeemed. In contrast, peasants and other working people, especially slaves and hired workers, have no rights to speak of, and even have no right to appeal if they are wronged. Legal provisions such as "slaves and hired workers must not lead the master" and "slaves must not testify against the master" are everywhere. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: Under cruel economic exploitation and political oppression, the peasants in China's past dynasties "lived a poor and miserable slave-like life. The peasants were bound by the feudal system and had no personal freedom. The landlords had the right to arbitrarily scold and even execute the peasants, and the peasants had no political rights." ⑩ In this case, the feudal law itself gave the landlords and bureaucrats the conditions to create various unjust verdicts for the peasants. Then, their greedy and insatiable so-called "customary rights" have a lot of room to maneuver. As Marx pointed out, "There is no fundamental discussion of the customary rights of privileged classes. The law not only recognizes their reasonable rights, but even often recognizes their unreasonable desires" ((11).

    Second, the law has always been subordinate to politics. Any law is aimed at the ruled class, not something that binds the hands and feet of the rulers themselves. Lenin said: "No law can limit the expression of the will of the ruling class." ((12 China's feudal dynasties of all dynasties have so-called relatively fixed codes, such as the Han Law, Tang Law, and Ming Law. They are often formulated at the beginning of the founding of the country after large-scale peasant uprisings. At that time, the feudal rulers were awed by the aftermath of the peasant uprisings and urgently needed to adjust the contradictions between the various groups of the ruling class. Generally speaking, they considered their long-term interests more. However, the greedy and insatiable nature of the feudal rulers made them want to break through it as long as possible. Du Zhou of the Han Dynasty once truthfully said: "Where did the three feet come from? What the previous master was, was written as law, and what the latter master was, was sparse as an order. It was right at the time, what ancient law is it." ((13 Therefore, the feudal emperor could increase the exploitation and oppression of the peasants with new laws at any time.

    Third, any substantive law "has its own unique and necessary litigation form" ((14), and torture to extract confessions is a litigation form organically linked to the content of feudal law and is an inevitable product of feudal substantive law. In feudal society, torture to extract confessions is an important means of creating "unjust verdicts." All "unjust verdicts" often have to go through torture to obtain confessions to complete the legal formalities, that is, the so-called "under the hammer, what can you not get" ((15), "under tea torture, what prison cannot be formed" ((16, and torture itself is legally creating a large number of unjust verdicts. Therefore, legal history is not without such records: "Some died under the stick without true feelings and no stolen goods, and some died in prison without complete confessions" ((17: "Although not sentenced to death, most of them died violently" ((18. It can be seen that "the application of the exploiting class's law is more inhumane than the law itself" ((19. In this way, how can Hai Rui, who has class prejudice and often uses severe punishments, "never had seven or eight people shackled in front of the yamen," not create unjust verdicts?

    From the above three points of view, the so-called "legal" behavior and "illegal" behavior of feudal lords are often difficult to distinguish. It is not the legalization of illegal behavior, but the legalization of illegal behavior. And the so-called "three-foot imperial law" itself is a sanctified illegal behavior.

    Secondly, although the greed of the exploiting ruling class to squeeze the working people as much as possible is generally restricted by the level of production development in this society and the degree of resistance struggle of the people, the provisions of the law are also influenced by this restriction, but the boundless greed of the members of the feudal landlord class wants to break through this restriction and act on its own as long as possible. Taking the Ming Dynasty as an example, after Zhu Yuanzhang promulgated the "Great Ming Law," he ordered "his descendants to abide by it, and any ministers who dared to discuss changes would be charged with the crime of changing the ancestral system" ((20, but it was not long before it was "regarded as a mere formality due to long-term adherence." Zhu Yuanzhang once took vigorous action to punish corruption on the surface, not only repeatedly ordered and prohibited, but also uniquely adopted the cruel punishment of "peeling skin and stuffing grass," but in the entire Ming Dynasty, from the prime minister and the factory guards to the eunuchs, and from the government to the county, how many were not corrupt. The famous ones such as Yan Song, Liu Jin, and Wei Zhongxian were all rich enough to rival the country, and the licentious and brutal feudal emperors were their leaders and backers.

    In addition, in the feudal central authoritarian state, no matter how centralized the power is, there is always a certain degree of feudal separatism. Therefore, there is a great emperor in the court, and there are also small emperors or local emperors in the local areas. They all want to make a little independence. In this way, in feudal society, what the landlord class often enjoys is far more than just "legal rights." And in their situation of corruption, mutual protection between officials, collusion, and nominal unity, how much can a "clean official" holding the "three-foot imperial law" achieve even if he wants to "work hard" for the interests of his class? Like Hai Rui, although he was touted as "upright and unyielding," he only approved "one out of twenty points" on the issue of allowing accusations against local officials.

    Hai Rui's attitude towards the "reversal of unjust verdicts" is also clear. He believed that "small people do not care about righteousness," firstly, "it is easy to approve the reversal of cases, which makes the people argue"; secondly, "prison is valuable for the first words, and the county official asks the first words"; thirdly, "the county official is closest to the people, and the superiors should only hold the county official accountable, and should not easily reverse the case." This adds another obstacle to the redress of unjust verdicts.

    Finally, it should be pointed out that even if certain "clean officials" restrain the atrocities of certain corrupt officials and evil tyrants under the premise of maintaining feudal rule, without the anti-feudal struggle of the peasants, there would be no "reversal of unjust verdicts" due to "appeasing the people's grievances." If we uglify the image of the peasants and obliterate the struggle and revolutionary nature of the peasants like Comrade Wu Han, and depict the peasants as so pale and weak, begging for a "blue sky master," it is impossible to produce "clean officials" like Hai Rui at all, because the "clean officials" themselves are a kind of resistance reaction caused by the anti-feudal class struggle of the peasants within the feudal rulers.

    In summary, we can only draw the conclusion that Comrade Wu Han arbitrarily fabricated history, completely distorted and exaggerated the essence and role of Hai Rui's "reversal of unjust verdicts," thereby completely distorting and exaggerating the essence and role of so-called "clean officials" like Hai Rui.

    Comrade Wu Han distorted Hai Rui, who was loyal to the feudal emperor and loyal to the feudal law, into a "savior" of the peasants. This shows that his view of the state and the law is trans-class. In his view, the state and the law are not tools of class oppression, and the feudal state and the law are not tools for oppressing the peasants, but "sacred objects" that treat landlords and peasants equally. Therefore, what can be blamed is not the feudal state system and the law itself, but only those corrupt officials and evil tyrants who violate the imperial law. This is completely contrary to Marxism-Leninism.

    ① The style of the book is generally divided into three parts except for occasional incompleteness: first, record the case, then record
      Original and defendant's pleadings, and finally Hai Rui's judgment. It is the earliest surviving work praising Hai Rui.

  “关心民瘼”等特点。尤其是所谓“平冤狱”，最能迷惑人们的视听。看来，吴晗同志是洞悉此中奥妙的，所以他的《海瑞罢官》就是从“平冤狱”开场的。因此，我们也想就这个问题谈些看法。
    海瑞平反了些
    什么“冤狱”？
    吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》和《论海瑞》等文中，不止一次地称颂海瑞：“亲自审案，处理了许多积案，昭雪了许多冤狱。对农民和地主打官司的案件，他是站在农民一边的。海知县、海都堂是当时被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星。”海瑞的一生是“站在农民和市民的立场上向封建官僚、大地主斗争的一生”。
    吴晗同志的这些结论，经过查检，我们认为是完全没有根据的。
    海瑞在淳安、兴国知县任上仅留下受委参审的八个案件（见《海瑞集》）。在这八个案件中，有六个是人命案：（一）雇工吴吉祥为地主吴湘看守柴山，打死“到山盗砍柴”的吴镧，吴镧之子吴沄控告吴湘指使。（二）地主婆吴阿伊的婢女青香被吴夫的堂弟吴万打伤不日身死，吴万说是伊氏毒死青香嫁祸于人，伊氏则称毒是吴万下的，企图借此脱身。（三）胡胜荣、胡胜祖弟兄与邵时重争山，胜祖病死，胜荣捏称为邵打伤致死。
  （四）邵守愚黑夜误杀前来其鱼塘盗鱼的堂弟邵守正，被控以仇杀。（五）徐继向其妹夫戴五孙讨债，“两相争闹”将戴打死，有人诬告系戴妻徐氏与里长潘天麒通奸伙同其兄与奸夫共同谋害。（六）地主陈舜兴控告另一恶霸地主曾克滢打死其雇工李福兴，而曾不服。
    以上六案中，虽然第一、二、六案涉及劳动人民与地主之争，但海瑞经过“细审众词”，弄清“真实之情”以后，一一为地主吴湘、地主婆伊氏，甚至“富恶田东”曾克滢等三人“平了反”。第三、四、五案也分别为争山的邵时重、养鱼的邵守愚和里长潘天麒等雪了“冤”。与此相反，对于替主人看守柴山而犯命案的雇工吴吉祥，则断令承担全部罪责，维持“抵死”的原判。除这六条人命案以外，剩下的两案：一为何姓族人互争坟地，纯系有产者内部之争；一为贫民方淙与方天禹两家岁荒缺食，同向地主何孟敦借谷，由于何未履行合同仅借给方天禹不到半数的稻谷，致使方天禹与方淙发生争吵，互有漏失，因而相控。后一案始作俑者原系地主何孟敦，但海瑞在参审时，却以何所提出的“仓谷日久，或有消耗”为理由，认为“曲亦不在孟敦”，竟不加谴责。
    从以上八案看来，海瑞只不过替几个地主、恶霸“平了反”，而且还为一个地主作了开脱，是根本谈不上“站在农民一边”的。
    关于海瑞断狱的材料，还有一部署名李春芳编次并作序的《海刚峰先生居官公案传》。虽然它的刊行（一六○六年）去海瑞之死（一五八七年）未远，但它基本上是一部依托海瑞并宣扬海瑞的公案小说。这部公案传共分七十一回，收录七十六案①，取材于宋元话本和海瑞生前即已流行于民间的公案故事者不少，但也参考了一部分司法审判材料，其中很可能包含有海瑞本人的东西。它所收录的七十六案，就案情来分：属于强奸、通奸特别是奸杀方面的有二十九案，谋财害命的十四案，家庭、婚姻与财产纠纷的十二案，诬害或诬告的八案，抢劫偷窃与诈骗的七案。此外，因逼债殴死人命的两案，谋反的一案，霸占人妻的一案，争水互殴的一案，猴精作祟的一案。从阶级关系来看，大部分都是地主、官僚与大商人等剥削阶级内部荒淫无耻、勾心斗角、互相撕杀的案件。比较明显地涉及剥削阶级与劳动人民和小商小贩等之间的案件只有二十五个。其中属于劳动人民与其他被统治者反抗和破坏封建制度与秩序的二十案，海瑞均从严格维护封建制度和保护地主人身、财产安全出发，残酷地加以镇压与惩办。如第三十六回浙江诸暨县郊有傅仕志、朱如张等数百人“谋举大事”，经人告发，海瑞立即大肆搜捕，并判处“傅仕志、朱如张等十人不待时斩，余徒各以从者拟死”，便是比较典型的例证。剩下的五案分别为地主逼债并殴死贫民或其家属的两案，故意杀死自己的仆人诬害别人的两案，倚仗权势霸占人妻并陷害其夫的一案，总之都是地主阶级穷凶极恶迫害人民的案件。而海瑞对待这类滔天罪行，只要有所借口，能开脱的就尽可能开脱。如第七回“为富不仁、剥民肥己”、
  “流毒一方”的“凶豪”王爱礼，到贫民胡进保家逼债，并击伤进保母亲，以致不日身死，他却反咬一口，捏称自己被进保打伤，七次传讯均不到庭，结果海瑞竟以“失手”、“误伤”、“非其心之所然”为理由，只让王爱礼出钱殡葬，不予追究。其余四案虽然作了处理，但其中两个主杀奴的案件，主要是由于凶犯诬害了另外两家地主并被揭发才判处的。真正称得上抑制了一下豪强非法侵害贫苦人民的案件只有两件。一件是土豪沈一森，因逼债活活打死贫民何仲升，反诬控何仲升偷盗。另一件是宦家之子骆可显，横行乡里，奸人妻女，他霸占了贫民龙得才的老婆，却买通县官诬赖龙得才拐带，判处龙得才多年徒刑。这两案在众怒难犯的情况下，海瑞才不得不以“所为不轨”、“实犯律条”为由，分别加以惩处。
    在这部公案传中，编撰者虽然点缀了这样两个打击豪强的案件，但就以上二十五个案件的整体看来，海瑞充当地主阶级专政的工具，运用封建法律镇压农民与其他被统治者的反抗这一基本点，则是昭然若揭的。尽管它是被封建文人“艺术夸张”过的小说，可是它所反映的问题，倒比吴晗同志所作的结论更加接近历史真实。
            “平冤狱”的实质何在？
      “冤狱”是一个法律概念。它的含义是：法官在审理案件时，把无罪判成有罪，姑息、纵容、包庇有罪，而使受害者衔冤受屈不为昭雪。在封建社会里，造成冤狱的原因很多，但主要不外两种情况：一种是承审官吏由于趋炎附势，阿谀权贵或贪赃受贿有意制造的；一种是由于站在剥削阶级立场上主观臆断，偏听偏信造成的。特别是涉及农民的案件，在那种无官不贪、无吏不污，并以镇压农民为首要职志，以刑讯逼供为审判特征的暗无天日的封建统治下，更是无狱不冤。在整个封建社会中，所谓“冤狱”真是罄竹难书。正因为如此，偶尔有个把所谓“清官”能够明断三几件公案或昭雪一两桩冤狱，经过封建文人的渲染、美化，就最能起麻痹人民的作用。
    但是我们能否象吴晗同志那样，认为“清官”就是“公正无私”甚至“站在农民一边”的呢？不能。首先，“清官”的断案是以封建法律为准绳的，而封建法律是封建统治者意志的表现。封建统治者甚至也不隐讳这一点。中国古代法学家就说：“立刑法以威其下，下有畏于上，故主有以牧之。”②因此，我们不能单纯从法律形式上来看审判是否公正，不能单纯从法律规定来看犯罪与否。也就是说，不能认为合法的就是合理的、公正的，违法的就是错误的，就是罪行，而必须分析其社会性质与阶级内容。否则，就无异于承认封建法律对于农民也是合理的、公正的。这样一来，也就必然会导致歌颂封建法律本身及其立法者，从而肯定封建剥削制度。
    其次，所谓“明断公案”与“平冤狱”，即使打击了个别的贪官污吏与恶霸豪强，也不能说这是“代表农民的利益”，
  “站在农民一边”的。因为法律既然是统治者整个阶级意志的表现，它就不只是保护其成员的个人利益，而重要的是保护其阶级的整体利益与长远利益。为此，它在镇压农民的同时，也有必要约束一下其内部集团与成员个人损害其整体与长远利益的行为。“明断公案”与“平冤狱”，自来就是封建统治者所需要并列入他们法律之内的。在我国长达数千年的封建社会中，自秦汉中央集权君主专制制度建立以来，历代王朝为了维护和巩固统一的国家政权以期更有效地统治和镇压农民，就曾一再颁行打击和压抑地方割据势力的法令。与此同时，它们为了缓和内部矛盾与阶级矛盾并装饰一下门面，在必要时也会对一些太不象话的贪官污吏和豪强恶霸加以制裁。以明朝为例，从朱元璋开始，几乎历代皇帝都未断过这样的诏令：“凡一应罪犯，悉依大明律科断，法司不许深刻”，“问罪依大明律，不许深文枉滥”③。有时对造成冤狱的官吏也要惩办，朱元璋就曾下令：“凡鞠问罪囚，必须依法详情推理，毋得非法苦楚，锻炼成狱，违者究治。”④就是到嘉靖年间，虽然阶级矛盾已很尖锐，但统治者仍“谕法司问理词讼，必须辨曲直，从‘公’处断，使人无冤”⑤。然而，封建统治者的这种种作法，其目的不外是想借以维持一个普天之下的大冤狱。因为被封建国家和法律所保护的封建剥削制度，对于农民和其他劳动人民来说，就是一个暗无天日的大冤狱。农民的一切疾苦都是从这里产生的。而封建国家的所有官吏正是看守这一冤狱的工具。这种实质，海瑞基于他的阶级本能也是有所察觉的。他不是说，如果不维护一下法纪，恪守祖宗成宪，而使“纲纪尽废”，就会“天下大乱”吗？
    不仅如此，“清官”平反这类“冤狱”还能起这样一种作用：为“三尺皇家法”，为封建皇帝的“金科玉律”，增添一圈表面看来“谁也不许侵犯”的光轮，从而显示其“神圣性”，以便更有效地镇压农民。恩格斯曾谈到英国资产阶级为什么要神圣地看待资产阶级法律的问题，他说：“对资产者说来，法律当然是神圣的，因为法律本来就是资产者创造的，是经过他的同意并且是为了保护他和他的利益而颁布的。资产者懂得，即使个别的法律条文对他不方便，但是整个立法毕竟是用来保护他的利益的，而主要的是：法律的神圣性，由社会上一部分人积极地按自己的意志规定下来并由另一部分人消极地接受下来的秩序的不可侵犯性，是他的社会地位的最可靠的支柱。”⑥恩格斯的分析同样适用于封建法律。“清官”们“执法如山”，也就使封建法律的“神圣性”得以产生迷惑人的效果，特别是当这种“神圣性”已被他们自己践踏得不成体统的时候。在这一方面，“清官”的确起了贪官所不能起的作用，他们“既善于理解自己阶级的共同利益，又能非常聪明地维护这些阶级利益”。
            “平冤狱”的作用不容夸大
    吴晗同志不但严重地歪曲了清官“平冤狱”的本质，而且在夸大“清官”“平冤狱”的作用方面也大大地超过了封建文人。
    我们认为，在一定的历史条件下，某些官吏从巩固封建统治出发，抑制了一下某些贪官恶霸的暴行，但是，他们在这方面所能起的作用也是非常有限的，对于整个历史的发展起不了促进作用。但吴晗同志的笔下，似乎只要海瑞这类“清官”祭起这“三尺皇家法”，就可以解决任何问题，甚至可以为农民创造出一个“世外桃源”来，这只能是欺世之谈。恰恰相反，海瑞执行“三尺皇家法”，在镇压农民、制造冤狱方面是行家，而在用来限制内部成员的暴行方面却往往失灵。
    这里首先必须打破一种观念，即把封建法律表面上赋与地主阶级的权利，和地主阶级超越规定所享有的权利截然加以划分，甚至对立起来。其实在封建社会，二者之间并没有不可逾越的鸿沟。这是因为：
    第一，封建法律本身在形式上就是不平等的，它是一种公开的特权法。马克思说：“在中世纪，权利、自由和社会存在的每一种形式都表现为一种特权。”⑦我国封建社会，自先秦的
  “刑不上大夫，礼不下庶人”开始，一直到明、清，始终贯彻了“法可执于庶民，而不可行于乡官”这一老传统。所谓“王子犯法与庶民同罪”，只不过是掩耳盗铃的弥天大谎。历代的封建法典，如有名的唐、明律，都赋与了地主和官僚以各种特权，甚至任意打骂和杀死农民的权利。例如明律就规定：家长骂奴婢和雇工人是合法的，诬告奴婢和雇工人无罪，“殴奴婢不至死者无罪”，“殴雇工人非折伤勿论，至折伤以上减凡人三等”，以及“过失”杀奴婢和雇工人无罪。这里所谓“过失”，只不过是为其开脱罪责的遁词而已。而大贵族、大官僚、大地主在诉讼方面，还享有相沿已久的所谓“八议”⑧。明成祖甚至规定，功臣的俸禄可以抵一次、二次乃至三次死罪⑨。在这些“法定权利”以外，如果仍须科刑，他们还有一重保障，即用钱来赎罪。唐、明律都规定：除十恶大罪以外，只要有钱，从笞十到死刑都可以赎。与此相反，农民与其他劳动人民，特别是奴婢与雇工，则毫无权利可言，即使受冤也无权申诉。法律上奴婢与雇工人
  “不得首主”，“奴婢不得证主”等规定比比皆是。正如毛泽东同志所指出的：中国历代农民在残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫下，
  “过着贫穷困苦的奴隶式的生活。农民被束缚于封建制度之下，没有人身的自由。地主对农民有随意打骂甚至处死之权，农民是没有任何政治权利的”⑩。在这种情况下，封建法律本身就赋与了地主和官僚对农民制造各种冤狱的条件。那么，他们贪婪无厌的所谓“习惯权利”也就大有游刃的余地。正如马克思所指出的，“根本谈不到特权等级的习惯权利。法律不但承认他们的合理权利，甚至经常承认他们的不合理的欲求”（（11。
    第二，法律自来就是从属于政治的。任何法律都是针对被统治阶级，而不是束缚统治者自己手脚的东西。列宁说：“任何法律都不能限制统治阶级意志的表现。”（（12我国历代封建王朝有所谓比较定型的法典，如汉律、唐律、明律等。它们往往是在大规模农民起义之后，开国之初所制定的。当时封建统治者慑于农民起义的余威，以及亟需调整统治阶级各集团间的矛盾，一般说来，考虑其长远利益较多。但封建统治者贪婪无厌的本性，使他们只要有可能就要加以冲破。汉朝的杜周即曾真实地说过：“三尺安出哉，前主所是著为律，后主所是疏为令，当时为是，何古之法乎。”（（13因此，封建皇帝随时都可能以新的法令来加重对农民的剥削与压迫。
    第三，任何实体法都“具有本身特有的必要的诉讼形式”（（14，而刑讯逼供便是和封建法律的内容有机地连系在一起的诉讼形式，是封建实体法的必然产物。在封建社会中，刑讯逼供是制造“冤狱”的重要手段。一切“冤狱”往往都要通过刑讯取得口供来完成法定手续，即所谓“捶楚之下，何求而不得”（（15，“茶酷之下，何狱不成”（（16，而刑讯本身又在合法地大量制造冤狱。因此，法律史上不乏这样的记载：“有情未真赃未获而死于杖下者，有招供未具而死于狱中者”（（17：“虽非死刑，大半殒毙”（（18。由此可见，剥削阶级“法律的运用比法律本身还要不人道得多”（（19。这样，这位具有阶级偏见而又动辄使用重刑的海瑞，“衙门前尝不绝七八人枷号”，又怎能不制造冤狱呢？
    从以上三点看来，封建主的所谓“合法”行为与“不法”行为往往是难解难分的。不是不法行为的合法化，便是合法的不法行为。而所谓“三尺皇家法”本身，就是神圣化了的不法行为。
    其次，虽然剥削统治阶级尽可能多地压榨劳动人民的贪欲，一般说来，多少要受这一社会的生产发展水平和人民群众反抗斗争的程度所制约，法律的规定也受这一制约的影响，但封建地主阶级的成员永无底止的贪欲，只要有可能也要突破这种制约而自行其是。以明代为例，朱元璋颁布了“大明律”之后，曾令“子孙守之，群臣敢稍议更改，即坐以变乱祖制之罪”（（20，但曾几何时就由于“因循日久，视为具文”。朱元璋在表面上对于惩办贪污也曾雷厉风行过一阵，不但三令五申，而且独出心裁地采取了“剥皮实草”的酷刑，但终明一代上自首相与厂卫权阉，下至府县又几人不贪。有名的象严嵩、刘瑾、魏忠贤等均富可敌国，而荒淫残暴的封建皇帝便是他们的头头和靠山。
    此外，在封建的中央集权制国家，不管集权到什么程度，总存在着不同程度的封建割据。因此有朝廷的大皇帝，也还有地方的小皇帝或土皇帝。他们多少都要闹点独立性。这样一来，在封建社会中，地主阶级所经常享有的就远不限于什么“法定权利”。而在他们这种贪墨成风、官官相护、狼狈为奸和貌合神离的情况下，手执“三尺皇家法”的“清官”，即使想为本阶级的利益“奋发有为”一番，又能有多大作为？就象海瑞，虽然被吹嘘成“刚直不阿”，但在允许告乡官的问题上，他所批准的也只不过“二十分中之一而已”。
    在“平冤狱”问题上，海瑞本人的态度也是鲜明的。他鉴于“小民不顾理义”，一则曰“轻于准理翻案，使民争讼之道也”；再则曰“狱贵初辞，县官所问正初辞也”；三则曰“县官于民最亲，上司止当责成县官，不可轻为翻案”。这就给冤狱的昭雪，又增添了一道路障。
    最后还应该指出的是，某些“清官”在维持封建统治的前提下，即使对某些贪官恶霸的暴行有所抑制，但是，如果没有农民反封建的斗争，就不会有因“息民怨”而“平冤狱”的产生。如果象吴晗同志那样丑化农民的形象，抹煞农民的斗争性与革命性，而把农民描绘成那样苍白无力，一味乞求什么“青天大老爷”，也就根本不可能产生海瑞这类“清官”，因为“清官”本身正是农民反封建的阶级斗争在封建统治者内部所引起的一种抵制性的反应。
    综上所述，我们只能得出这样的结论：吴晗同志任意伪造历史，完全歪曲和夸大了海瑞“平冤狱”的本质与作用，从而也就完全歪曲和夸大了海瑞这类所谓“清官”的本质与作用。
    吴晗同志把一个忠于封建皇帝、忠于封建法律的海瑞歪曲为农民的“救星”，这正说明了他的国家观与法律观是超阶级的。在他看来，国家与法律并不是阶级压迫的工具，封建国家与法律并不是压迫农民的工具，而是对地主与农民一视同仁的“圣物”，因此，可以指责的并不是封建的国家制度与法律本身，只不过是那些违反皇家大法的贪官污吏与恶霸豪强而已。这是完全违反马克思列宁主义的。
