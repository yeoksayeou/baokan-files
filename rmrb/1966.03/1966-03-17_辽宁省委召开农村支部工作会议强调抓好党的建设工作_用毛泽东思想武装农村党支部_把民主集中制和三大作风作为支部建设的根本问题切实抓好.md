    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th - The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently held a rural branch work conference, calling on Party organizations at all levels in rural areas throughout the province to place the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, to further arm all Party members in rural areas with Mao Zedong Thought, to better play the role of Party branches as fighting fortresses, to unite and lead the broad masses of commune members, to carry out the three great revolutionary movements, and to victoriously complete the various tasks of socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas.
    More than 1,000 people attended the conference, including secretaries, organization ministers, and rural work ministers of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, municipal party committees, prefectural party committees, and county party committees; secretaries of commune party committees; secretaries of Party branches of production brigades; and secretaries of Party branches of grassroots agricultural, commercial, and trade enterprises. At the meeting, they conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on giving prominence to politics and strengthening Party building, summarized and exchanged experiences in rural branch work, and also studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Information provided at the meeting showed that most Party branches in rural areas of Liaoning can conscientiously implement the Party's line and policies, closely unite the broad masses, actively complete the various tasks assigned by higher Party organizations, and lead cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. However, a considerable number of Party branches do not give enough prominence to politics and their three great work styles are not strong enough. They only pay attention to grasping production, neglecting politics, and neglecting Party building, especially failing to conscientiously organize Party members and cadres to study Chairman Mao's works. This is not in line with the current new situation and new tasks of the vigorously developing revolution and construction in rural areas of Liaoning Province.
    The meeting held that to strengthen rural branch building, the first thing to do is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well. Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on Party building begins with building the Party ideologically. To build the Party ideologically, boils down to arming the minds of Party members with Mao Zedong Thought, so that our Party organizations and all Party members can strictly act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought in all work. The experiences of many advanced Party branches introduced at the meeting, such as the Xiadianzi Brigade in Huanren County, the Doushuangshuzi Brigade in Liaoyang County, the Yangtun Brigade in Heishan County, the Shangguan Brigade in Beizhen County, and the Lamaqiaozi Brigade in Faku County, are all good examples of living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and achieving outstanding achievements in the three great revolutionary movements. Their experience proves that to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, it is necessary to raise the awareness of Party members in studying Chairman Mao's works, and to raise their understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's works; it is necessary to put great effort into the word "application," studying with ideological problems and practical problems in work. Party members and cadres should currently focus on solving the problem of worldview in their study of Chairman Mao's works, so that rural Party members and cadres can become thorough revolutionaries with firm positions and unlimited loyalty to the revolutionary cause, like Comrade Jiao Yulu. According to the characteristics of Party members in rural areas, in the study, it is advisable to advocate studying one or two articles at a time, clarifying one or two viewpoints, and solving one or two problems, gradually moving from the shallow to the deep. The meeting especially demanded that rural Party branch secretaries and branch committee members should take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought well, and also organize the masses, especially organizing the study of poor and lower-middle peasants and young people.
    The meeting pointed out that while strengthening the ideological building of the branch, it is necessary to attach importance to organizational building. In the organizational building of the branch, it is currently necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's principle of democratic centralism. The whole Party must re-study Chairman Mao's instructions on democratic centralism, and conscientiously implement democratic centralism as the fundamental system of the Party and the state in rural branches. How to correctly implement democratic centralism? First of all, the Party branch must fully promote democracy, encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of Party members. All major issues in the Party's work should be submitted to the Party member congress for full discussion and decision, and should not be decided by individuals. Whether it is Party members or the masses, they should be allowed to express different opinions, let everyone speak, and listen to good words, bad words, correct words, and wrong words, and let people finish speaking. Party members or the masses should be allowed to criticize cadres; if cadres make mistakes, they should, according to the specific situation, take different forms and make self-criticisms to Party members and the masses. In internal Party discussions, if there are major differences, it is best not to rush to make a decision, but to study Chairman Mao's works, go to the masses for investigation, repeatedly study, unify understanding, and then draw conclusions. Secondly, the branch committee should also implement a system of combining collective leadership with individual division of labor and responsibility. The branch secretary should give play to the role of the committee members, be good at concentrating everyone's experience and wisdom, and unite the members of the branch committee to work together to do a good job. Branch committee members should have a clear division of labor, not only grasping the work under their charge, but also caring about the overall situation and helping the branch secretary to do a good job, so that the branch committee can truly form a strong leadership core. Again, it is also necessary to strictly abide by the organizational principles of the individual obeying the organization, the minority obeying the majority, the lower level obeying the higher level, and the whole Party obeying the central authorities. Conscientiously implement the Party's line, policies, and instructions from higher levels.
    The meeting pointed out that the Party's three great work styles—the style of combining theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the masses, and the style of self-criticism—are the scientific summary of Comrade Mao Zedong's experience in Party building. The meeting demanded that the establishment and development of the Party's three great work styles be resolutely grasped as the fundamental issue of strengthening rural branch building. The meeting held that to develop the style of combining theory with practice, it is necessary to thoroughly understand both ends, to use the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought to observe and handle problems in work, and to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, proceeding from reality in everything, conscientiously conducting investigations and research, and earnestly listening to opinions from the masses. In order to closely link with the masses, it is necessary to educate Party members on the mass viewpoint and firmly establish two most basic viewpoints: first, the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly; second, the viewpoint of believing in and relying on the masses. All Party members in rural areas should also consciously and actively carry out criticism and self-criticism, and should play a vanguard role and exemplary role in everything at all times, uniting the broad masses around the Party branch.
    The meeting held that the purpose of strengthening rural branch building is to improve the combat effectiveness of rural Party organizations and to do a good job in the three great revolutionary movements. In branch work, it is wrong to only grasp production and business, without giving prominence to politics and without grasping Party work, but to grasp Party work in isolation from the Party's central tasks and the struggle for production will also make Party work weak and powerless. The correct approach is to combine these two aspects well. The branch should learn to grasp revolution and promote production, and strengthen Party building by leading actual struggles. The meeting called for, in order to improve agricultural production throughout the province and lay the foundation for achieving the goals stipulated in the "National Program for Agricultural Development," it is necessary to take class struggle as the key link, to do a good job in socialist education, to develop the spirit of Dazhai, to mobilize all commune members, to launch a mass movement to learn from Dazhai and catch up with Dazhai, and to promote the further development of a new upsurge in agricultural production.
    The meeting also demanded that Party committees at all levels throughout the province must place the work of building Party branches in rural areas in an important position, and resolutely correct the erroneous tendency of only grasping production targets and technical measures, without giving prominence to politics, and without grasping Party building work. Party committees at all levels must thoroughly change their leadership style, adhere to the leadership methods of combining general appeals with specific guidance, combining leadership with the masses, and going from the masses to the masses, as consistently advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong; face the grassroots, go deep into the grassroots, take root in the grassroots, and truly regard the grassroots as their base of activities. The main leading cadres of Party committees at all levels should take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, frequently go deep into the grassroots to squat on the spot, grasp first-hand information, summarize and promote the experience of branch work, establish models, guide the overall situation, and continuously improve the leadership level of grassroots Party organizations.
    At this meeting, according to the recommendations of the municipal and prefectural Party committees, a group of good branches were commended. Fifty units were commended as Party branches.

    辽宁省委召开农村支部工作会议强调抓好党的建设工作
    用毛泽东思想武装农村党支部
    把民主集中制和三大作风作为支部建设的根本问题切实抓好
    新华社沈阳十六日电　中共辽宁省委最近召开的农村支部工作会议，号召全省农村各级党组织把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，进一步用毛泽东思想武装农村中的全体党员，更好地发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用，团结带领广大社员群众，开展三大革命运动，胜利地完成农村中社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各项任务。
    参加这次会议的有辽宁省各市委、地委、县委的书记、组织部长和农村工作部长，公社党委书记，生产大队党支部书记，基层农事企业财贸单位的党支部书记等共一千多人。他们在会议上认真地学习了毛主席有关突出政治、加强党的建设的指示，总结并交流了农村支部工作的经验，还学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹。
    会议提供情况表明，辽宁各地农村中的党支部，大多数能认真贯彻执行党的方针政策，紧密团结广大群众，积极地完成上级党组织所给予的各项任务，领导干部和群众学习毛主席著作。但是，也有相当一部分党支部突出政治不够，三大作风不过硬。只注意抓生产，忽视政治，忽视党的建设，特别是没有认真组织党员、干部学习毛主席著作。这和当前辽宁省农村蓬勃发展的革命和建设的新形势、新任务不相适应。
    会议认为，加强农村支部建设，首先要学好用好毛主席著作。毛泽东同志的建党思想，首先就是从思想上来建党。从思想上建党，归根结蒂就是用毛泽东思想武装党员的头脑，使我们的党组织和全体党员在一切工作中都能严格按照毛泽东思想办事。会上介绍的桓仁县下甸子大队、辽阳县窦双树子大队、黑山县杨屯大队、北镇县上观大队、法库县拉马桥子大队等许多先进党支部的经验，都是活学活用毛泽东思想并在三大革命运动中取得卓越成就的好典型。他们的经验证明，要学好用好毛主席著作，必须提高党员学习毛主席著作的自觉性，提高他们对毛主席著作伟大意义的认识；必须在用字上狠下功夫，带着思想问题和工作中的实际问题去学习。党员干部学习毛主席著作，当前应当着重解决人生观问题，使农村党员干部都能象焦裕禄同志那样，成为立场坚定，对革命事业无限忠诚的彻底革命者。根据农村中党员的特点，在学习中应提倡一次学一两篇文章，明确一两个观点，解决一两个问题，逐渐由浅入深。会议特别要求，农村党支部书记和支部委员要带头学好用好毛泽东思想，还要组织群众，特别是组织好贫农下中农和青年的学习。
    会议指出，在加强支部的思想建设同时，必须重视组织建设。在支部的组织建设中，当前要认真贯彻执行党的民主集中制原则。全党要重新学习毛主席有关民主集中制问题的指示，把民主集中制当作党和国家的根本制度在农村支部里切实地实行起来。怎样正确贯彻执行民主集中制呢？首先，党支部要充分发扬民主，鼓励党员的积极性和创造性。凡是党的工作中的重大问题，都要提交党员大会充分讨论决定，不能由个人说了算。无论对党员还是对群众，都要允许讲不同意见，让大家说话，对好话，坏话，正确的话，错误的话都要听，并且让人家把话说完。要允许党员或群众批评干部；干部有了错误，应该根据具体情况，采取不同形式，向党员和群众作检讨。党内讨论问题，遇有重大分歧，最好不要急于作出决定，应该通过学习毛主席著作，到群众中去调查，经过反复研究，统一认识，再作结论。其次，支部委员会还要实行集体领导与个人分工负责相结合的制度。支部书记要发挥委员的作用，善于集中大家的经验和智慧，团结支委会的成员同心协力做好工作。支部委员要有明确分工，既要抓好分管的工作，又要关心全面，帮助支部书记做好工作，使支部委员会真正形成一个坚强的领导核心。再次，还要严格遵守个人服从组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央的组织原则。认真贯彻执行党的方针政策和上级的指示。
    会议指出，党的三大作风——理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风，以及自我批评的作风，是毛泽东同志关于党的建设经验的科学总结。会议要求把树立和发扬党的三大作风，作为加强农村支部建设的根本问题切实抓好。会议认为，发扬理论和实践相结合的作风，必须吃透两头，要运用毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法去观察和处理工作中的问题，要象焦裕禄同志那样，一切从实际出发，切实搞好调查研究，认真倾听来自群众的意见，为了密切联系群众，必须对党员进行群众观点的教育，牢固地树立起两个最基本的观点：一是全心全意为人民服务的观点；二是相信群众、依靠群众的观点。所有农村中的党员还要自觉地、积极地开展批评自我批评，时时事事都要起先锋作用和模范作用，把广大群众团结在党支部的周围。
    会议认为，加强农村支部建设的目的，是为了提高农村党组织的战斗力，搞好三大革命运动。在支部工作中，只抓生产、业务，不突出政治，不抓党的工作是错误的，但是脱离党的中心任务和生产斗争，孤立地抓党的工作，也会使党的工作变得软弱无力。正确的做法应该是把这两方面很好地结合起来。支部要学会抓革命促生产，通过领导实际斗争来加强党的建设。会议号召，为把全省农业生产搞上去，为实现“全国农业发展纲要”规定的目标打下基础，必须以阶级斗争为纲，搞好社会主义教育，必须发扬大寨精神，动员全体社员群众，开展一个学大寨赶大寨的群众运动，促进农业生产新高潮的进一步发展。
    会议还要求全省各级党委必须把农村中党支部的建设工作摆到重要地位上来，切实纠正那种只抓生产指标和技术措施，不突出政治，不抓党的建设工作的错误倾向。各级党委必须彻底转变领导作风，坚持运用毛泽东同志一贯提倡的一般号召与具体指导相结合，领导与群众相结合，从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法；面向基层，深入基层，扎根基层，真正把基层作为自己活动的基地。各级党委的主要领导干部，都要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，经常深入基层蹲点，掌握第一手材料，总结推广支部工作经验，树立样板，指导全面，不断地提高基层党组织的领导水平。
    这次会议，根据各市委、地委的推荐，表扬了一批好支部。受表扬的党支部有五十个单位。
