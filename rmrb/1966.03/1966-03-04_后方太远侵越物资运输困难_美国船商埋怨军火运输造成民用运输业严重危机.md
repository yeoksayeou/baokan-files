    Overextended Rear Lines Cause Difficulties in Transporting Supplies for Vietnam War
    American Ship Owners Complain that Military Supplies Transport is Causing a Severe Crisis in Civilian Transport
    (Xinhua News Agency, New York) An article in the *Wall Street Journal* on February 24th stated that the US expansion of the war in South Vietnam has put American merchant ships under heavy pressure, and many ship companies' customers have been snatched away by foreign shipping companies.
    The article revealed that, according to the American shipping industry's estimates, "the total amount of US military supplies shipped to the Vietnam region rose to an average of 463,166 tons per month in the second half of 1965, almost double the monthly average before the large-scale troop increase last summer. Nearly 98 percent of supplies and two-thirds of the soldiers are transported to the region by sea."
    The article pointed out: "The task of transporting military supplies is almost entirely undertaken by shipping companies flying the American flag," which "is definitely a mixed blessing for the country's fourteen subsidized shipping companies."
    The article quoted the Pacific Transportation Business Manager of the National Shipping Isbrandtsen Lines as saying: "Without a doubt, the commercial position of shipping companies is getting worse, and foreign shipowners are reaping the benefits."
    He emphasized: "It is very difficult to win back customers lost in this way."
    Amsden, the Vice Chairman of Lorents Company—a West Coast freight forwarding company said to have many customers—said that the company "has reduced the number of goods it entrusts to American shipping companies from 50 percent last year to 10 percent at present."
    Eight months ago, Pacific Vegetable Oil Company used to ship approximately 10,000 tons of goods per month on American-flagged ships. However, James Isler, the General Manager of Transportation at Pacific Vegetable Oil Company, said, "Now all our goods are shipped on foreign ships... Even if the situation in Vietnam eases, we will probably continue to charter foreign ships."
    The article said that shipowners also complained that "the government pays them too little in freight—sometimes 40 percent less than the corresponding commercial price."
    The article emphasized: "In addition to the current lack of unloading space, unloading in the chaotic ports of Vietnam takes a very long time." The article revealed that the "President Harding" of the American President Lines in San Francisco recently spent thirty-seven days waiting for a vacant berth at the Da Nang pier, and other freighters were said to have been delayed for six weeks or longer.
    The article pointed out, "Such delays have a double impact on shipping companies." "Ships are anchored and idle, resulting in huge cash outlays, and expenses are also incurred due to disrupted schedules."
    A recent survey by American shipping companies of sixteen ships on the Vietnam route showed that delays cost an extra $865,696 in freight in the fourth quarter of last year, with each ship averaging fifteen and a half days longer than usual unloading time.
    The article revealed that shipping companies have requested subsidies for delays in unloading at South Vietnamese ports, but the government has not taken any action. (Attached picture)

### 后方太远侵越物资运输困难  美国船商埋怨军火运输造成民用运输业严重危机

    后方太远侵越物资运输困难
    美国船商埋怨军火运输造成民用运输业严重危机
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：《华尔街日报》二月二十四日刊载一篇文章说，美国扩大南越战争使美国的商船遭受沉重压力，许多船公司的顾客被外国轮船公司抢走了。
    文章透露，据美国航运业估计，“美国运往越南地区的军用物资总量在一九六五年下半年上升到每月平均四十六万三千一百六十六吨，比去年夏天大举增兵以前每月的平均数增加将近一倍。将近百分之九十八的供应和三分之二的士兵是经海路到这个地区去的。”
    文章指出：“运送军事物资的任务几乎全部由挂美国旗的轮船公司担任”，这“对这个国家的十四家接受津贴的轮船公司来说肯定是一件好坏参半的事情”。
    文章引述国家海运伊斯米尔轮船公司太平洋运输业务经理的话说：“毫无疑问，轮船公司的商业地位是每况愈下了，外国轮船主正在坐收渔利。”
    他强调指出：“这样失掉的主顾是很难争取回来的。”
    洛雷茨公司——一家据说有很多客户的西海岸货物托运公司——的副董事长阿姆斯登说，这家公司“已把委托美国轮船公司运输的货物数量从去年的百分之五十减少到目前的百分之十。”
    在八个月以前，太平洋植物油公司一直用挂美国国旗的轮船每月装运大约一万吨货物，但是，太平洋植物油公司运输总经理詹姆斯·伊斯勒说，“现在我们的所有货物都用外国船装运……即使越南局势缓和下来，我们大概将继续租用外国船只”。
    文章说，船主们还抱怨说，“政府给他们的运费太少——有时候比相应的商业价格少百分之四十。”
    文章强调指出，“除了目前卸货地方不够之外，在杂乱的越南港口卸货时间拖得很长。”文章透露，旧金山美国总统轮船公司的“哈定总统号”最近在岘港码头等待靠码头的空位花了三十七天，其他货轮据说有拖了六个星期或者更多时间的。
    文章指出，“这样耽搁时间对轮船公司有双重影响。”“轮船抛锚闲等，现款开支很大，由于时间表被打乱而支出的费用也很大。”
    美国轮船公司最近对走越南这条航线的十六艘船所作的调查表明，去年第四季度由于耽搁时间使运费多花了八十六万五千六百九十六美元，每艘船比通常的卸货时间平均多了十五天半。”
    文章透露，轮船公司要求对在南越港口卸货的耽搁时间给予补贴，但是政府没有采取任何行动。（附图片）
