    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, March 6th. On the eve of Ghana's ninth anniversary of independence (March 6th), President Nkrumah, in a speech to the Ghanaian people broadcast by Radio Guinea, said that he would do his utmost to "crush this heinous rebellion." He called on the Ghanaian people to muster their courage, move forward with perseverance, and never retreat.
    Nkrumah began by saying: "It was on this day [nine years ago] that the united strength of the Ghanaian people achieved independence from British imperialism. This achievement was not an easy one. It required sacrifice, suffering and loss from all of us."
    He said: "It was not until I arrived in Beijing, China, that I learned that some members of my armed forces, supported by some members of my police force, had set about overthrowing my government. I know that you have always been loyal to me, to the Party, and to the government, and I expect all of you at this moment of trial to maintain a firm resolve and resolute resistance, regardless of intimidation."
    He then listed the achievements of the People's Convention Party under his leadership at home, as well as the role it has played in international affairs.
    Nkrumah accused the rebels of "arresting, detaining, and assassinating ministers, party officials, and trade unionists, as well as indiscriminately killing unarmed men and women." He said, "I know you have courage and determination! I know the extent to which you are angered by this lawless rebellion. I know that you will take the initiative to crush the rebellion when the time is right. The Party's strength will guarantee the restoration of your dignity and personality. As for me personally, I will do my utmost to crush this heinous rebellion."
    Nkrumah said: "In our Party's struggle for independence, we have had opponents and enemies. Imperialism, neo-colonialism, and their accomplices and lackeys have never been our friends. They have tried to undermine the work of the People's Convention Party by various means. All their attempts have failed. Even several attempts on my life have failed."
    He pointed out: "What happened in Ghana is not a coup, but a rebellion, which will be crushed by its own actions." He said, "Slander and defamation cannot defeat a brave and courageous man. I will soon be with you again."
    Nkrumah pointed out that the rebels "issued orders that our ninth anniversary of independence—our great day—should not be celebrated. This proves that they are violating the firm will of the Ghanaian masses. The fact that they do not allow you to celebrate the ninth anniversary of independence—the great National Day—shows that they are destroying what we have spent years building."
    Nkrumah finally called on the Ghanaian people to muster their courage, move forward with perseverance, and never retreat. He said: What has happened is only a stage in our struggle, and it will pass, "Victory is ours."
    Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, March 7th. President Nkrumah and President Sékou Touré arrived in Bamako by the same plane from Conakry on the morning of the 7th. They were warmly welcomed at the airport by Malian President Modibo Keita. Also present at the airport to welcome them were leaders of the Sudanese Union-African Democratic Rally of Mali and ministers of the Malian government.
    After Nkrumah got off the plane, he first embraced the Malian president and others. The national anthems of Ghana, Guinea, and Mali were played at the airport. The three presidents together reviewed the guard of honor. Then, they rode in the same convertible to the presidential palace.
    Accompanying President Nkrumah and President Touré to Bamako were Guinean Foreign Minister Lansana Béavogui, as well as other senior Guinean officials and senior Ghanaian officials.

    恩克鲁玛总统谴责帝国主义及其爪牙的破坏活动
    号召加纳人民以坚韧不拔精神粉碎叛乱
    恩克鲁玛总统和杜尔总统到达马里受到凯塔总统热烈欢迎
    新华社科纳克里六日电　在加纳独立九周年（三月六日）前夕，恩克鲁玛总统在通过几内亚电台向加纳人民发表的讲话中说，他将尽他最大的努力来“粉碎这一罪恶的叛乱”。他号召加纳人民鼓起勇气，以坚韧不拔的精神，永远前进，决不后退。
    恩克鲁玛首先说：“就是在
  （九年前）这一天，加纳人民联合起来的力量从英帝国主义手里取得了独立。这个成就不是一件轻易的事。它使我们大家都付出了牺牲，遭受了痛苦和损失。”
    他说：“直到我到达中国的北京之后，我才得知我的武装部队的某些人员在我的某些警察人员的支持下着手推翻我的政府。我知道，你们一向是忠于我、忠于党和政府的，我期望你们大家在这个考验的时刻，不顾恫吓，保持坚定的决心和坚决进行抵抗。”
    他接着列举了在他领导下的人民大会党在国内所取得的成就，以及在国际事务中所起的作用。
    恩克鲁玛指责叛乱者“逮捕、扣留和暗杀部长们、党的文职官员和工会工作者以及乱杀手无寸铁的男女”。他说，“我知道你们有勇气和有决心！我知道你们对这一无法无天的叛乱感到愤怒的程度。我知道你们在适合的时机将会采取主动粉碎叛乱。党的魄力将保证重新挽回你们的尊严和人格。至于我个人，我将尽我最大的努力去粉碎这一罪恶的叛乱。”
    恩克鲁玛说：“在我们党为独立而进行的斗争中，我们有过对手和敌人。帝国主义、新殖民主义以及它们的爪牙和走狗一直就不是我们的朋友。他们曾经企图通过种种办法来破坏人民大会党所做的工作。他们的一切企图都遭到了失败。甚至几次谋害我的生命的企图也遭到了失败。”
    他指出：“在加纳发生的不是政变，而是叛乱，它将被它自己的行动所粉碎。”他说，“造谣诬蔑诋毁不了一个勇敢而有胆量的人。不久我将再同你们在一起。”
    恩克鲁玛指出，叛乱者“发布命令说我们的独立九周年——我们的这个伟大的日子——不应该庆祝了。这证明他们违反了加纳群众的坚决意志。他们不允许你们庆祝独立九周年——伟大的国庆日——这一事实表明他们在摧残我们花了多年工夫建造起来的事业。”
    恩克鲁玛最后号召加纳人民鼓起勇气，以坚韧不拔的精神，永远前进，决不后退。他说：已经发生的事情只不过是我们斗争中的一个阶段，是会过去的，“胜利是属于我们的。”
    新华社巴马科七日电　恩克鲁玛总统和塞古·杜尔总统七日上午由科纳克里乘同一架飞机到达巴马科。他们在机场上受到马里总统莫迪博·凯塔的热烈欢迎。到机场欢迎的还有马里苏丹联盟党的领导人和马里政府的部长们。
    恩克鲁玛下飞机后，首先同马里总统和其他人拥抱。机场上演奏了加纳、几内亚和马里的国歌。三位总统一同检阅了仪仗队。接着，他们同乘一辆敞篷车去总统府。
    随同恩克鲁玛总统和杜尔总统到达巴马科的，有几内亚外交部长朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉，以及其他几内亚高级官员和加纳高级官员。
