    Visiting Friendly Neighbor Pakistan
    Chang Zhiqing, Lin Cai, Chen Zhanyuan, Yang Yuan
    From late November to early December last year, we—the Chinese journalists delegation—made a friendly visit to Pakistan at the invitation of the Pakistan Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Wherever we went, we received a warm welcome and generous hospitality.

          Sino-Pak Friendship is More Beautiful Than Flowers
    On the morning of November 24, in Rawalpindi—the temporary capital of Pakistan—we were invited to attend a meeting of the Pakistan National Assembly. We also received cordial and friendly receptions from the Speaker of the Pakistan Assembly and government ministers, and held cordial and friendly talks. They all praised in unison the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan and the continuous development of friendly relations.
    Throughout the entire visit, starting from Peshawar, we were often moved by the sincere affection of the Pakistani people for the Chinese people. In many places—in the square of Peshawar University, in a spinning mill in Karachi, in the workshops of factories near Chittagong, at a symposium of rickshaw and handicraft workers on the streets of Kamila, at the entrance of a hotel in Lahore, at the airport in Dhaka… as soon as we arrived, bursts of enthusiastic applause and cheers erupted from the crowd: "Long live Sino-Pak friendship!"
    The night in the square of Peshawar University was unforgettable. That day—November 22nd—we were invited to visit an exhibition there. The square was brightly lit, and more than a thousand students gathered there. As we passed through the surging crowd, applause and cheers rose and fell, and the entire square was like a boiling ocean. Finally, we were already in the car and about to leave, but several students rushed to shake our hands, repeatedly instructing us: "Please bring our warmest greetings and best wishes to the Chinese students."
    The reception held for us by the Lahore China-Pakistan Friendship Association was also a very cordial and enthusiastic gathering. The hosts praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan in warm language: "Pakistan and China are the best neighbors, and we often hear the voices of 650 million Chinese people supporting Pakistan." "In history, China has always been a friend of Pakistan; after the liberation of China, it is a great friend of Pakistan; now, after the test of this Indo-Pakistani conflict, it proves that China is a great brother of Pakistan!" "China's policy has never been two-faced; she has consistently supported the struggle against aggression and oppression." Their speeches were often interrupted by bursts of applause.
    One sunny morning, we were waiting for a plane back to Dhaka at Kamila Airport. In the lagoon on one side of the green airport, a patch of red lotus flowers bloomed, bright and dazzling. The manager of the airport asked people to pick a large handful of lotus flowers and distribute them to us, saying: "Blooming flowers are the most beautiful, but Sino-Pak friendship is more beautiful than flowers." He added: If it were imperialists, even if they offered one million U.S. dollars, I wouldn't give them even a petal.
    While visiting the Peshawar region, we had a discussion with a group of elderly people. One of the elders with a fluttering silver beard was particularly talkative. He talked about the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan from as far back as two thousand years ago to the present. Finally, he stood up excitedly and said loudly: "U.S. imperialism and its lackeys always want to undermine the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China, but this is like using a knife to cut the flowing water of a river. No matter how sharp the knife is, the flowing water cannot be cut off. On the contrary, the more it is cut, the more it flows. No force can undermine the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China." This reminded us of a famous poem by Li Bai, a poet of the Tang Dynasty: "Draw a knife to cut the water, and the water flows more."

      Pakistan is Moving Forward
    In Pakistan, we visited many cities and factories, and also visited the vast countryside. We are pleased to have the opportunity to see the achievements Pakistan has made in economic construction and the development of national culture.
    Pakistan has good conditions for developing its national economy. It is vast in area, with fertile land, and the tropical climate is conducive to agricultural production. Industrial resources are also very rich, with large deposits of minerals such as iron, chromite, uranium, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. More importantly, it has one hundred million hardworking and courageous people.
    In recent years, the Pakistani government has increasingly emphasized the development of agriculture. In particular, cash crops such as jute, cotton, sugarcane, and tea have developed rapidly. Grain production has also increased compared to the past.
    In order to develop agriculture, the Pakistani government pays great attention to water conservancy work. According to a person in charge of the East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority, the upstream of East Pakistan's two main rivers—the Ganges and the Brahmaputra—are both in India. In developing water conservancy, people must not only fight against nature, but also fight against the Indian reactionaries. India built a large dam on the upper reaches of the Ganges, twelve miles from the border of East Pakistan. When the rainy season concentrates in the summer, it discharges a large amount of water, causing many farmlands in East Pakistan to be flooded; when there is a shortage of water in the winter, it cuts off the river water, making many lands in East Pakistan unable to be cultivated.
    However, water conservancy work in East Pakistan has not stopped because of this. They have taken measures such as raising river banks, raising coastlines, and extracting groundwater to control floods to facilitate irrigation. The right bank of the Brahmaputra River has been raised, and preparations are being made to raise the left bank. Dikes are being built in coastal areas to prevent seawater backflow. As for the water dams and other supplementary projects in the western three rivers of the Indus River system built in West Pakistan, they are also being accelerated.
    Pakistan's industry has also developed significantly in recent years, especially industries based on agriculture as raw materials, such as jute, textiles, and sugar manufacturing.
    Although Pakistan has always been rich in jute and cotton, it did not have a single jute factory before independence, and the cotton textile industry was also pitifully small. Now it is different. There are already twenty-four jute factories with seventeen thousand looms. The cotton textile industry has also developed from 170,000 spindles and 4,800 looms at the beginning of independence to the current 2.8 million spindles and 42,500 looms. The sugar manufacturing industry was almost non-existent in the past. Now, East Pakistan alone has more than a dozen sugar factories. In addition, after independence, especially in recent years, modern enterprises such as shipyards, fertilizer plants, cement plants, oil refineries, paper mills, and glass factories have also been established.

    In the development of national culture, Pakistan has also achieved positive results.
    The first is the development of national languages. The Pakistani constitution stipulates that Urdu and Bengali are the national languages, replacing English. National languages are now commonly used in teaching in primary and secondary schools, and some universities have also begun to use national languages in teaching. The number of literary and artistic works and scientific and cultural books published in national scripts, as well as films produced in national languages, is gradually increasing.
    In Dhaka, we had the opportunity to appreciate the music and dance performances of the teachers and students of the Bulbul Academy of Arts, and also watched the large-scale dance drama "Kashmir Dance" performed at the Engineering College. These performances all have distinct national styles: healthy, lively, and beautiful.

        The Combat Friendship of Journalists
    During our visit to Pakistan, we had many unforgettable meetings with our colleagues in the Pakistani press. Through these activities, the friendship between Chinese and Pakistani journalists and the solidarity between the journalists of the two countries in the anti-imperialist struggle were further strengthened.
    The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists held a grand reception for us. The journalist organizations in all major cities of Pakistan that we visited also held equally warm receptions for us. Journalists from the two countries gathered together, fully exchanging and expressing the combat friendship forged by the peoples of the two countries in the struggle against the common enemy, defending their respective national territories and sovereignty, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    It has been more than three months since we left Pakistan, but those days full of friendship and moving scenes are still before our eyes. (Attached picture)

### 访问友好邻邦巴基斯坦

    访问友好邻邦巴基斯坦
    常芝青  林彩  陈展元  杨原
    去年十一月下旬到十二月上旬，我们——中国新闻工作者代表团，应巴基斯坦新闻广播部的邀请，在巴基斯坦作了半个多月的友好访问。我们走到哪里，都受到热烈的欢迎和盛情的款待。
          中巴友谊比鲜花更美
    十一月二十四日上午，在拉瓦尔品第——巴基斯坦临时首都，我们应邀列席了巴基斯坦国民议会的会议。同时分别受到了巴基斯坦议长和政府部长们亲切友好的接见，进行了亲切友好的谈话。他们都异口同声地颂扬了中巴两国人民的兄弟友谊和友好关系的不断发展。
    在从白沙瓦开始的整个访问期间，我们常常为巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的真挚的情谊所感动。在许多地方——在白沙瓦大学的广场上，在卡拉奇的一个纺纱厂里，在吉大港附近工厂的车间里，在卡米拉街上的三轮车和手工业工人的座谈会上，在拉合尔的旅馆门口，在达卡的飞机场上……当我们到达的时候，立刻就从人群中迸发出一阵阵的热烈的鼓掌和欢呼：“巴中友谊万岁！”
    白沙瓦大学广场上的夜晚是令人难忘的。那一天——十一月二十二日，我们应邀去那里参观一个展览会。广场上灯火辉煌，有一千多个学生聚集在那里。当我们在汹涌的人群中间通过的时候，鼓掌声和欢呼声此起彼伏，整个广场就象一片沸腾的海洋。最后，我们已经坐上汽车要离开了，还有几个学生争先恐后地跑来和我们握手，一再嘱咐我们：“请把我们最亲切的问候和最美好的祝愿带给中国学生们。”
    拉合尔巴中友协为我们举行的招待会，也是一次非常亲切和热烈的聚会。主人以热情的语言，赞扬中巴两国人民的友谊：“巴中两国是最好的邻居，我们经常听到六亿五千万中国人民支持巴基斯坦的声音。”“在历史上，中国一直是巴基斯坦的朋友；中国解放以后，是巴基斯坦的伟大的朋友；现在，经过这次印巴冲突的考验，证明中国是巴基斯坦的伟大的兄弟！”“中国的政策从来不是两面三刀的，她一贯支持反侵略、反压迫的斗争。”他们的讲话常常为一阵阵的掌声所打断。
    一个阳光灿烂的早晨，我们在卡米拉机场上等飞机回达卡。在绿草如茵的机场一边的湖荡里，开放着一片红色的莲花，鲜妍夺目。这个机场的经理叫人去采来一大把莲花分送给我们，他说：“盛开的花朵是最美丽的，但巴中友谊比鲜花更美丽。”他接着补充说：如果是帝国主义者，就是出一百万美元，我连花瓣也不给一个。
    在白沙瓦地区访问时，我们曾同一批老者座谈。其中一个飘拂着银须的老者特别健谈，他从远自二千年前谈到现在的中巴两国人民的友谊，最后他激动地站起来并且高声说：“美帝国主义及其走狗总想破坏巴中人民的友谊，但是，这好比是用刀来砍江河的流水，不管这把刀多么锋利，流水是砍不断的，相反，越砍越流，任何力量也不能破坏巴中人民的友谊。”这使我们想起我国唐代诗人李白的一句名诗：“抽刀断水水更流”。
      巴基斯坦在前进
    在巴基斯坦，我们参观了许多城市和工厂，也访问了广大的农村。我们高兴有机会看到巴基斯坦在经济建设和发展民族文化方面所取得的成就。
    巴基斯坦具有发展民族经济的良好条件，它的幅员辽阔，土地肥沃，热带气候又有利于农业生产。工业资源也很丰富，有大量的矿藏，如铁、铬铁、铀、煤、石油、天然气等。更重要的是它有一亿勤劳勇敢的人民。
    近年来，巴基斯坦政府日益重视发展农业。特别是经济作物如黄麻、棉花、甘蔗、茶叶等发展较快。粮食比过去也有增加。
    为了发展农业，巴基斯坦政府很注意水利工作。据东巴水利电力局的一位负责人谈：东巴的两条主要河流——恒河和布拉马特普拉河，上游都在印度。在发展水利事业中，人们不但要和自然界作斗争，还要和印度反动派作斗争。印度在恒河上游离东巴边境十二英里处筑了一个大坝，夏天雨水集中时，它大量放水，使东巴的许多农田遭到水淹；冬天缺水时，它又把河水卡断，使东巴的许多土地不能耕种。
    但是东巴的水利工作并没有因此停顿。他们采取加高河岸、加高海岸、抽地下水等办法来控制水灾，以利灌溉。布拉马特普拉河的右岸已经加高了，准备再加高左岸。在靠海的地方修筑堤坝，以防海水倒灌。至于在西巴基斯坦兴修的印度河水系中西部三条河的水坝和其他补充工程，也正在加速进行。
    巴基斯坦的工业，近几年来也有了较大的发展，特别是以农业为原料的工业，如黄麻、纺织、制糖等工业的发展较快。
    巴基斯坦虽然历来盛产黄麻和棉花，但是在独立前却没有一个黄麻工厂，棉纺织业也少得可怜。现在则不同了。已有二十四家黄麻工厂，织机一万七千台。棉纺织业也由独立初期的十七万纱锭、四千八百台织机，发展为现在的二百八十万纱锭、四万二千五百台织机。制糖工业过去几乎没有，现在仅东巴就有十多家制糖厂。此外，独立以后，特别是近几年来，还建立了造船厂、化肥厂、水泥厂、炼油厂、造纸厂、玻璃厂等现代化的企业。
    在发展民族文化方面，巴基斯坦也取得了积极的成果。
    首先是发展民族语言。巴基斯坦宪法规定乌尔都文和孟加拉文为国语，以代替英语。中、小学已普遍地用民族语言教学，有些大学也开始用民族语言教学。用民族文字出版的文艺作品和科学文化书籍以及用民族语言摄制的影片逐渐增多。
    在达卡，我们有机会欣赏了勃尔·勃尔艺术学院师生们的音乐舞蹈表演，还观看了在工程学院演出的大型舞剧《克什米尔舞》。这些演出都具有鲜明的民族风格：健康、活泼、优美。
        新闻工作者的战斗友谊
    在巴基斯坦访问期间，我们同巴基斯坦新闻界的同行有过许多次令人难忘的会见。通过这些活动，进一步加强了中巴两国新闻工作者之间的友谊和两国新闻工作者在反帝斗争中的团结。
    巴基斯坦全国记协为我们举行了盛大的招待会。在我们所到的巴基斯坦各大城市的记者组织都为我们举行了同样热情的招待会。两国新闻工作者欢聚一堂，充分地交流和表达了两国人民在反对共同敌人、保卫各自国家的领土和主权、维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中所结成的战斗友谊。
    我们离开巴基斯坦已经三个多月了，但是，那些充满友谊的日子和动人的场面依然在我们眼前。（附图片）
