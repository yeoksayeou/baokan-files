    What should forestry departments and cadres, as assistants to Party committees and governments in leading forestry production, do in their work? The recent National Forestry Work Conference put forward excellent suggestions: Forestry departments and cadres should consciously highlight politics, and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, place the work of doing a good job in "people work" in the primary position.

    Afforestation and greening the motherland is a task involving the broadest masses. Trees can only be planted in large numbers and extensively if everyone participates. After planting, they need everyone to care for them and protect them, so that they can survive and grow well. To develop forestry production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, we must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and follow the mass line. We must strengthen political and ideological work among the masses, so that they understand for whom they are planting trees and why, in order to fully display the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary drive of self-reliance and hard struggle. This is the prerequisite for doing a good job in forestry.

    Planting people before planting trees. This is a truth for forestry work. For forestry cadres, spreading advanced technical experience in afforestation is undoubtedly important; but what is especially important is to do a good job in the ideological education of the masses, and to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Technology must be mastered by the masses. If political and ideological work among the masses is done well first, and the masses are fully mobilized, then even if there are certain shortcomings and difficulties in technology and material conditions, they can be solved by relying on the masses, so that forestry production can be developed in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In the past, some forestry cadres, when speaking to the masses, only talked about trees and wood, and the masses called them "wooden cadres." They put in a lot of effort, but achieved little, because they did not understand that only by doing political work well first can technical work be done well.

    Forestry work, like other work, is carried out in the context of class struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants stand high and see far. They understand the importance of developing forestry for building a new socialist countryside and supporting the socialist construction of the country. They firmly support afforestation. However, there are also a few people with capitalist ideas who only care about personal interests and disregard collective and national interests; they only care about immediate interests and disregard the long-term interests of the country and the people. They are not so interested in afforestation work, which has a relatively long production cycle and slow benefits. Individual selfish and extremely self-interested people and hostile class elements even destroy forests for cultivation, indiscriminately cut down trees, and damage forestry construction. This shows that on the forestry front, there is also a complex class struggle, a struggle between two roads. This also shows that on the forestry front, it is also necessary to take class struggle as the key link, first grasp the struggle between the two roads, and persistently educate peasants with collectivist ideology, in order to develop forestry production faster and better. Grasping class struggle works wonders, and this is also entirely applicable to forestry construction.

    To highlight politics in forestry, the key lies in strengthening the leadership of forestry work by Party committees at all levels. All rural cadres and forestry workers should be organized to conscientiously study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, so that they firmly establish the idea of running forestry for the people and relying on the people to run forestry. They should be regularly urged to do a good job in political and ideological work, and experiences in this area should be summarized and exchanged in a timely manner, and advanced individuals and advanced units in this area should be commended. Cadres and forestry workers should be educated to conscientiously grasp the implementation of forest rights, handle problems in this regard in a timely manner, and correctly implement the Party and state forestry policies, in accordance with the principle of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. As an assistant to the Party committee and government, the forestry department should mainly report the situation and raise questions to the Party committee and government from a political and ideological perspective, so that the Party committee and government can take timely and effective measures to solve these problems. In short, from the Party committee to the forestry department, to the commune, brigade, and production team, all should first consider issues from a political point of view, and, on the basis of doing a good job in political and ideological work, formulate plans for developing forestry according to local conditions, and lead the masses in afforestation, nurturing forests, and protecting forests.

    Afforestation is in line with the fundamental interests of the masses and is a common wish and urgent need of the masses. The broad masses have realized from their own experience that only by planting trees and creating forests can they effectively combat natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand, and gradually achieve stable and high agricultural yields. Only then can they better develop diversified operations, increase the income of collectives and commune members, consolidate and strengthen the collective economy of the people's communes more quickly, and support national construction more forcefully. Since liberation, although China's forestry production has made great progress, many places still lack forests and trees. This situation has caused many inconveniences to the masses in their production and life. They all hope to develop forestry faster and change the natural appearance of their hometowns more quickly. This is the most important and fundamental favorable condition for developing China's forestry. As long as Party committees and governments at all levels earnestly strengthen leadership and do a good job in political and ideological work, the forestry construction of every place will develop at an unprecedented speed.

      "Hearts reddened, mountain tops greened." In the great struggle of planting trees and transforming the appearance of the motherland, in order to achieve the expected victory, it is necessary to first raise the awareness of the broad masses about the importance of forestry work, that is to say, it is necessary to arm the cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Party committees at all levels, especially county Party committees, should attach importance to developing forestry production, strengthen leadership over forestry work, and place the political and ideological construction of the forestry front in the first place. In this way, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and masses for afforestation, nurturing forests, and protecting forests will be more fully mobilized, so that China's forestry construction will advance along the correct direction and achieve even greater victories in the new period.

### 树木先树人

    树木先树人
    林业部门和林业干部，作为党委和政府领导林业生产的助手，应当怎样进行工作？最近召开的全国林业工作会议，提出了很好的意见：林业部门和林业干部，应当自觉地突出政治，在毛泽东思想指导下，把做好人的工作摆在首要的地位。
    植树造林，绿化祖国，这是一项群众性最为广泛的工作。树要依靠大家动手去栽，才能栽得多，栽得普遍；栽上以后，更要大家关心它、爱护它，才能活得多，长得好。为了多快好省地发展林业生产，就必须相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线；就必须对群众加强政治思想工作，使群众懂得为谁栽树，为什么栽树，以便充分发挥自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神和革命干劲。这是做好林业工作的前提。
    树木先树人。对于林业工作来说，这是一个真理。作为林业干部，传播植树造林的先进技术经验，无疑是重要的；但是尤其重要的，是做好群众的思想教育工作，用毛泽东思想武装群众。技术是要群众来掌握的。首先做好了对群众的政治思想工作，把群众充分地发动起来了，即使在技术方面，在物质条件方面，还有某些不足和困难，也能够依靠群众加以解决，使林业生产多快好省地开展起来。过去，有些林业干部对群众讲话，开口是树，闭口是木，群众就叫他们是“木头干部”。他们费力不小，而收效甚微，就是因为他们不懂得，只有首先做好了政治工作，然后才能够做好技术工作。
    林业工作同其他工作一样，是在阶级斗争的情况下进行的。广大贫农下中农，站得高，看得远，懂得发展林业对于建设社会主义新农村，对于支援国家社会主义建设的重要性，是坚决拥护植树造林的。但是，也有少数具有资本主义思想的人，只顾个人利益，不顾集体利益和国家利益；只关心眼前利益，不关心国家和人民的长远利益。他们对于生产周期比较长、受益比较慢的植树造林工作，并不是那么感兴趣；个别自私自利之心极为严重的人和敌对阶级分子，甚至毁林开荒，乱砍滥伐林木，破坏林业建设。这就说明，在林业战线上，同样存在着复杂的阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争。这也就说明，在林业战线上，同样要以阶级斗争为纲，首先抓好两条道路的斗争，坚持不懈地用集体主义思想教育农民，才有可能更快更好地发展林业生产。阶级斗争一抓就灵，这对于林业建设工作，也是完全适用的。
    突出政治搞林业，关键在于各级党委加强对于林业工作的领导。要组织所有农村干部和林业职工，认真地学习毛泽东同志著作，使他们牢固地树立为人民办林业、依靠人民办林业的思想。经常督促他们做好政治思想工作，及时地总结和交流这方面的经验，表扬这方面的先进人物和先进单位。教育干部和林业职工，按照国家、集体和个人兼顾的原则，认真地抓好林权的落实工作，及时处理这方面的问题，正确地贯彻执行党和国家的林业政策。作为党委和政府助手的林业部门，应当主要地从政治思想方面向党委和政府反映情况和提出问题，使党委和政府能够及时地采取有力的措施解决这些问题。总之，从党委到林业部门，到公社、大队和生产队，都应当首先从政治上考虑问题，在抓好政治思想工作的基础上，因地制宜地制订发展林业的规划，领导群众造林、育林和护林。
    植树造林符合群众的根本利益，是群众的共同愿望和迫切要求。广大群众从亲身经验中认识到，只有植了树，造了林，才能有效地战胜水、旱、风、沙等自然灾害，逐步实现农业的稳产高产；才能更好地发展多种经营，增加集体和社员的收入，更快地巩固和壮大人民公社集体经济，更有力地支援国家建设。解放以来，我国的林业生产虽然有了很大发展，但是不少地方仍然缺林少树。这种情况，已经使群众在生产和生活上感到许多不便。他们都希望更快地发展林业，更快地改变自己家乡的自然面貌。这是发展我国林业的最重要、最根本的有利条件。只要各级党委和政府切实加强领导，做好政治思想工作，每个地方的林业建设，都会以前所未有的速度发展起来。
      “红了心头，绿了山头。”在植树造林，改造祖国河山面貌的伟大斗争中，要想取得预期的胜利，必须首先提高广大群众对林业工作重要性的认识，就是说，必须用毛泽东思想把干部和群众武装起来。各级党委、特别是县委，要重视发展林业生产，加强对林业工作的领导，把林业战线的政治思想建设工作摆在首位。这样，就会把广大干部和群众造林、育林和护林的积极性更加充分地调动起来，使我国的林业建设沿着正确的方向前进，在新的时期中取得更加伟大的胜利。
