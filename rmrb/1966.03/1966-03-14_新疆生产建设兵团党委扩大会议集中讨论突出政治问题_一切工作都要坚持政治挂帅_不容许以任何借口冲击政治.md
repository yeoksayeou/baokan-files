    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 13th—The Party Committee of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at a recent enlarged working conference, called on all personnel of the Corps to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the five principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao regarding prominence of politics, learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, learn from Dazhai, and strive to build a better and more revolutionary corps, and strive to achieve new and greater development in production and construction.
    At this conference, the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on army building and political work were earnestly studied, as were the relevant documents of the recent political work conference convened by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army. The conference focused on discussing the issue of giving prominence to politics in the construction of the Corps. The conference held that, for sixteen years, the Production and Construction Corps has unswervingly implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and promoted the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance. In recent years, organizations at all levels of the Corps have resolutely implemented Vice Chairman Lin Biao's series of instructions on studying Chairman Mao's works and giving prominence to politics, setting off a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the Corps, and powerfully promoting the continuous development of the Corps' production and construction and various tasks. The direction of the Corps is correct, and it is a good corps created by Mao Zedong Thought. However, compared with the People's Liberation Army, Daqing, and Dazhai, the Corps has shortcomings in studying Chairman Mao's works, giving prominence to politics, revolutionization, and hard struggle and self-reliance, and cannot keep up with the needs of the developing revolutionary situation. Therefore, it is necessary to further highlight politics and accelerate the revolutionization of the Corps' construction. The conference held that giving prominence to politics is the foundation for strengthening the construction of the Corps' production teams, work teams, and fighting teams, and the foundation for ensuring that the Corps will never change its nature. Therefore, whether it is production and construction work, military work, technical work, business work, or any other work, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and adhering to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command. It is necessary to highlight politics at all times, in all matters, and in all places, and it is not permitted to attack politics under any pretext.
    The conference held that to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions, and work hard on the word "use." All personnel of the Corps must study, and leading cadres must especially take the lead in studying. Through the leading cadres taking the lead in studying, the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works that has already formed in the Corps will be led to a deeper and more solid stage, and new and greater learning results will be achieved.
    The conference also held that to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to grasp the socialist education movement well, firmly grasp class struggle, and further improve the socialist consciousness of all personnel, in order to ensure that the Corps' socialist construction cause achieves new and greater development; to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, promote the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, and accelerate the development of the Corps' production and construction cause; to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's ethnic policies and enhance ethnic unity; to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to do a good job of living political and ideological work, grasp living thoughts, and mobilize people's positive factors; to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to advocate a humble style and never be arrogant. All personnel must forever remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to advance, whereas conceit makes one lag behind."
    The conference held that to give prominence to politics, it is necessary to continuously accelerate the revolutionization of the leading core. Leading cadres at all levels must earnestly carry forward the glorious traditions of the Party and the People's Liberation Army, adhere to the four firsts, carry forward the three-eight work style, conscientiously participate in physical labor, conduct investigations and studies at selected points, and maintain close ties with the masses. The conference also required organizations at all levels to implement the issue of giving prominence to politics in production and construction, in preparedness for war, and in ethnic unity, to ensure the realization of the Corps' 1966 production and construction plan.

    新疆生产建设兵团党委扩大会议集中讨论突出政治问题
    一切工作都要坚持政治挂帅  不容许以任何借口冲击政治
    新华社乌鲁木齐十三日电  中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设兵团党委在最近召开的扩大的工作会议上，号召兵团全体人员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻林彪副主席提出的关于突出政治的五项原则，学习解放军，学习大庆，学习大寨，为建设一个更加革命化的好兵团而奋斗，为实现生产建设新的更大的发展而奋斗。
    这次会议，认真地学习了党中央、毛主席关于军队建设和政治工作的指示，学习了解放军总政治部最近召开的政治工作会议的有关文件，集中讨论了在兵团建设中突出政治的问题。会议认为，十六年来，生产建设兵团坚定不移地贯彻执行了党中央、毛主席的指示，继承和发扬了中国人民解放军的光荣传统，发扬了艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神。最近几年，兵团各级组织坚决地贯彻执行了林彪副主席关于大学毛主席著作和突出政治的一系列指示，在全兵团掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，有力地推动了兵团的生产建设和各项工作的持续发展。兵团的方向是正确的，是毛泽东思想缔造的好兵团。但是，和解放军、大庆、大寨比较，兵团在学习毛主席著作、突出政治、革命化以及艰苦奋斗、自力更生等方面，存在差距，还跟不上革命形势发展的需要。因此，必须进一步突出政治，加速实现兵团建设的革命化。会议认为，突出政治，是加强兵团生产队、工作队、战斗队建设的根本，是保证兵团永不变质的根本。因此，无论是生产建设工作、军事工作、技术工作、业务工作和其他一切工作，都必须坚持政治挂帅，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。必须时时突出政治，事事突出政治，处处突出政治，不容许以任何借口冲击政治。
    会议认为，突出政治，必须把学习毛主席著作摆在首位，把毛主席的书当作最高的指示，在“用”字上狠下功夫。兵团的所有人员都必须学，而领导干部尤其要带头学。通过领导干部带头学，把兵团已经形成的学习毛主席著作的群众运动，引向更加深入更加扎实的阶段，收到新的更大的学习成效。
    会议同时认为，突出政治，必须抓好社会主义教育运动，狠抓阶级斗争，进一步提高全体人员的社会主义觉悟，以保证兵团的社会主义建设事业取得新的更大的发展；突出政治，必须坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，加速发展兵团的生产建设事业；突出政治，必须认真执行党的民族政策，增强民族团结；突出政治，必须做好活的政治思想工作，抓好活思想，调动人的积极因素；突出政治，必须提倡谦虚的作风，绝不骄傲。全体人员要永远记住毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导。
    会议认为，突出政治，必须不断加速领导核心的革命化。各级领导干部要认真发扬党和解放军的光荣传统，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，认真参加体力劳动，蹲点调查研究，密切联系群众。会议还要求各级组织把突出政治问题，落实到生产建设上去，落实到战备工作上和民族团结工作上去，保证实现兵团一九六六年的生产建设计划。
