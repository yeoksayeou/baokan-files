    The biggest executioner of our time, U.S. imperialism, is increasingly and madly spreading chemical poisons and toxic gases in South Vietnam, slaughtering people, poisoning livestock, destroying crops, and creating disease. The Chinese people are filled with righteous indignation at the inhuman fascist atrocities of the American bandits! The Chinese people angrily denounce the towering crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people.
    For several years, in addition to using various modern weapons, U.S. imperialism has resorted to the most barbaric and brutal war methods, such as releasing poison gas and spreading poison, in a vain attempt to force the South Vietnamese people to stop resisting, in order to achieve its goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam and long-term division of Vietnam. Recently, U.S. imperialism's use of poison gas and poison has seen new developments: the scope of the release is becoming wider and wider, and the frequency is becoming more and more frequent; the U.S. authorities openly declared that they want to use this bloody method as a "basic standard weapon" for the U.S. military in "mopping up" operations, and will continue to use it in large quantities in the future; it is also preparing to use the help of West German militarism to produce and use various chemical weapons in South Vietnam. This shows that U.S. imperialism not only inherited the aggressive ambitions of the Hitler fascist bandits, but also exceeded the ferocious beastly behavior of the German fascist bandits, making all aggressors in history pale in comparison.
    The fact that U.S. imperialism wields the counter-revolutionary butcher knife and more and more frantically slaughters the South Vietnamese people cannot demonstrate its strength, but precisely shows its extreme weakness and cowardice. The Johnson administration's large-scale deployment of poison gas warfare proves that it has indeed exhausted its tricks and reached a dead end.
    U.S. imperialism naively believed that with B-52 bombers in the sky, aircraft carriers at sea, ground forces exceeding 220,000 and continuing to increase, coupled with the use of inhuman means such as poison gas and poison, it could intimidate the Vietnamese people and reverse its defeat on the South Vietnamese battlefield. This is completely a pipe dream.
    In fact, the more ferocious and brutal U.S. imperialism is, the more it can only deepen the hatred of the South Vietnamese people for it, only inspire the fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people, and only strengthen the Vietnamese people's belief in a decisive victory.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements on March 13 and 22 respectively, strongly condemning the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism in using various chemical poisons and toxic gases in the war of aggression against Vietnam. In the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, U.S. imperialism was also severely warned that no matter how crazy and ferocious it is, it cannot escape the fate of complete failure in South Vietnam. These two statements fully embody the steel-like fighting will of the 31 million Vietnamese people.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country issued a statement on March 24, expressing firm support for the just position of the Vietnamese people. We once again call on all peace-loving countries and people in the world to take immediate action to resolutely stop the aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism and resolutely support the great just struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and strive for the reunification of the motherland.

    制止美帝国主义的侵略魔爪
    当代最大的刽子手美帝国主义正在越南南方日益疯狂地撒放化学毒药和毒气，残杀人民，毒害牲畜，破坏庄稼，制造疾病。对于美国强盗这种灭绝人性的法西斯暴行，中国人民义愤填膺！中国人民愤怒声讨美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行。
    几年来，美帝国主义在使用各种现代化武器之外，还乞灵于施放毒气、撒布毒药等最野蛮、最残暴的战争手段，妄图迫使南越人民停止抵抗，以达到它永远霸占南越，长期分裂越南的目的。最近，美帝国主义使用毒气和毒药，又有了新的发展：施放的范围越来越广泛，次数越来越频繁；美国当局明目张胆地宣称要把这种血腥手段当作美军在“扫荡”中的一种“基本标准武器”，在今后继续大量加以使用；它还准备利用西德军国主义的帮助在南越生产和使用各种化学武器。这说明美帝国主义不仅继承了希特勒法西斯强盗的侵略野心，而且超过了德国法西斯强盗的凶恶兽行，使有史以来的一切侵略者都难以望其项背。
    美帝国主义挥动反革命的屠刀，越来越疯狂地对越南南方人民进行屠杀，绝不能说明它的强大，恰好表明它是极端的虚弱和胆怯。约翰逊政府大搞毒气战，证明它的确已经黔驴技穷，走投无路。
    美帝国主义满以为：天上有了B—52型轰炸机；海上有了航空母舰；地面部队已经超过二十二万，而且还要陆续增加；再加上使用毒气和毒药这种惨无人道的手段，就可以吓倒越南人民，挽回自己在南越战场上的败局。这完全是痴人作梦。
    事实上，美帝国主义越是凶恶、残暴，只能加深南越人民对它的仇恨，只能激励南越人民的斗志，只能加强越南人民决战决胜的信念。
    越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国外交部，在三月十三日和二十二日，分别发表声明，强烈控诉美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中使用各种化学毒药和毒气的罪恶行为。越南民主共和国外交部声明中，还严厉警告美帝国主义，不管它疯狂和凶恶到什么程度，也摆脱不了在越南南方彻底失败的命运。这两项声明，充分体现了越南三千一百万人民的钢铁般的战斗意志。
    我国外交部三月二十四日发表声明，表示坚决支持越南人民的严正立场。我们再一次呼吁全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，立即行动起来，坚决制止美帝国主义的侵略魔爪，坚决支持越南人民为解放南方、保卫北方、争取祖国统一而进行的伟大正义斗争。
