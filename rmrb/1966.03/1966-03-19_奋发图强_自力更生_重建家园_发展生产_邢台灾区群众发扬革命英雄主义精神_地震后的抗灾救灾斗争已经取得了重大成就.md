    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, 18th—Our correspondent reports: The people in the Xingtai earthquake disaster area, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have fought tenaciously in the face of severe natural disasters, demonstrating a great spirit of revolutionary heroism.
    Now, the struggle against disaster in the Xingtai earthquake area has achieved significant successes. During a recent visit to the epicenter of the earthquake, this reporter saw that the masses had returned to the fields for production as usual, and in many villages, the bells rang on time for starting and ending work. Some villages have already begun the labor of rebuilding their homes. On the third day after the disaster, when the aftershocks were still continuing and the earth was still trembling slightly, the laborers on a water conservancy construction site went to work. The entire construction site was bustling, and the pressure machines roared. In many villages, new slogan boards were erected, adorned with images of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and vows of "Striving for Strength, Self-Reliance, Rebuilding Homes, and Developing Production." The indomitable spirit of the people in the disaster area in the struggle against the disaster left a very deep impression on this reporter.
    During the visit to the disaster area, one sentence could be heard everywhere: "With Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of any difficulties!" At mass meetings where people in the disaster area discussed production for self-salvation, at various gatherings held by Party members, Youth League members, and militia members, and in the wards of the "battlefield hospital," people were reading aloud and explaining Chairman Mao's quotations. When faced with difficulties, people read Chairman Mao's books, and they derived infinite confidence and strength from Chairman Mao's books. After Old Poor Peasant Wang Loju ran out of his house during the earthquake on the morning of the 8th, he heard someone in the neighbor's house calling for help. He immediately ran to rescue four members of the neighbor's family from the collapsed house. As soon as the rescue was over, he rushed to the livestock shed and, risking the collapse of the earthen walls, rescued all five livestock of the team together with other commune members. This old poor peasant, who begged for food and worked as a farmhand in the old society, loves Chairman Mao's books. During these days of intense disaster relief activities, he still led a study group, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, and used Mao Zedong Thought to encourage everyone to actively participate in the struggle to rebuild their homes. He said: "Chairman Mao's books are the books for us poor people to make revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of any difficulties." He also told the reporter: "Please rest assured, people of the whole country! Difficulties cannot overwhelm us. The country is under construction, and there are many places where money is needed. We cannot lie on the state forever after the disaster; we have ways to be self-reliant!"
    The arduous struggle against disaster relief is also a vivid lesson in the contrast between the old and the new. After this disaster relief struggle, the people here cherish the socialist system and love the Party and Chairman Mao with incomparably deep feelings. Many elderly people compared this disaster with their experiences during the three years around 1943. They said that in those years, the area suffered from four major disasters: severe drought, locusts, floods, and the mopping-up operations of the Japanese invading army. People fled with their children, many families were scattered, wives and children were separated, and homes were destroyed. Although this earthquake caused them serious losses, the Party and the government, and all parties, provided timely rescue and support. The people's emotions were stable, and their lives were guaranteed, which was very different from the old society. Sixty-year-old Granny He Xiao'e said that during the great disaster before liberation, her husband starved to death, and she begged for food with her three children for three full years. Later, she even gave away one of her daughters in order to barely survive. She said to her son, Si Yinchou, with tears in her eyes: "Son! You must never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and never forget it for generations." Si Yinchou, who is the deputy captain of the production team, expressed his determination in front of his mother: "I was raised by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and I will definitely do a good job in production and serve the people wholeheartedly." These days, he has been busy building simple houses for the commune members, and only built a shack for his own family.
    Communist Party members and grassroots cadres fought heroically in the face of severe natural disasters. In the village where Si Yinchou is located, the moving story of a young female commune member and newly admitted Party member, Si Pingzhen, rescuing commune members is being spread. On the morning of the 8th, after she was awakened by the strong earthquake, she immediately put on her clothes and rushed out of the house. At this moment, she didn't think of anything else, but immediately rescued the masses. Along the way, she rescued an old woman and a child from the collapsed houses, and then together with the commune members, rescued three cadres. At this time, her fingers had been worn out from digging rubble, but she continued to run to the east end of the village and rescued two commune members. After the medical team arrived, she took the medical staff to treat the commune members, and didn't sleep for two days and two nights. When others advised her to rest, she said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu said that when the masses are in the most difficult time, Communist Party members should appear in front of the masses. I am now a probationary party member, and I want to train myself into a true Communist Party member!"
    In another heavily affected village, He Qinghai, an old Party member who had not been able to work in the fields for two years due to long-term illness, used his hands to dig through the rubble to rescue two families in a moment of time after the earthquake. Then, he threw himself into the disaster relief struggle day and night. He said: "We persevered even when the Japanese invading army was mopping up, so these difficulties are nothing. I am an old Party member, and now is the time when the Party needs me to play a role!"
    Many moving stories of grassroots cadres putting the public before themselves are also being spread in the disaster area. When a medical team of a certain unit was treating a child, they found that the child's injury was not caused by a single blow, but was slowly crushed by heavy objects. When the military doctor asked the parent who accompanied the child, it turned out that the parent was a cadre of the production team. When the roof collapsed, he ran out of the house alone, and when he found that many houses had collapsed, he immediately ran to rescue his neighbors. Later, he went to check the brigade's warehouse, and when he returned home to look for his child, he found that he was still buried under the house. By the time he dug him out, the child had been seriously injured. Also in this medical team, when the military doctor was treating a commune member with a serious head injury, the commune member asked the military doctor to save others first, because he was a cadre. He said, "Please ask for me, let me go back, I still have a lot of work to do." The high level of awareness and heroic and tenacious spirit displayed by the grassroots cadres in the face of the disaster greatly educated the medical staff.
    The Party branches in many villages have played a role as fighting fortresses in this disaster relief struggle. In a heavily affected village, under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members are repairing farm tools and arranging seeds in preparation for spring plowing. The cattle and horses that were rescued by the poor peasant old feeder Liu Luolian at the risk of his life during the earthquake are now well fed. The militiamen delivered the relief supplies sent by the state to every household, and the entire disaster relief work was carried out in an orderly manner. Late at night, Li Zhenhong, the secretary of the brigade Party branch, an old soldier who participated in the Nanniwan Great Production, together with other cadres of the brigade, visited the commune members from house to house to see how they were living. Li Zhenhong was injured in the head during the earthquake, but these days he and the cadres were always the first to get up and the last to rest in the entire village. After the earthquake, he often used the deeds of how people in Yan'an overcame various difficulties and carried out production for self-salvation after Yan'an was blockaded by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, to encourage the masses to be self-reliant and overcome the disaster, and also led the commune members to study Chairman Mao's quotations. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members of the entire village were divided into several groups, such as farming, building houses, and distributing relief supplies, and quickly restored the order of production and life.
    There are many such things in various places. One night, the Party branch committee of another production brigade held a meeting in a tent to discuss the blueprint for building a new home. The Party branch committee members spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. They said: "The earthquake knocked down our houses, but it cannot knock down our revolutionary determination!" Jin Jingyin, the secretary of the Party branch, was injured, and his eighteen-year-old daughter was killed when the house collapsed. He suppressed his grief and encouraged everyone at the meeting with high morale, saying: "We must lead the masses to fight against natural disasters just like we fight against class enemies!"
    The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is being increasingly strongly demonstrated in the disaster relief struggle of the masses in the disaster area. One night, this reporter participated in a discussion meeting for commune members studying Chairman Mao's works in a production team. People listened attentively to the captain, Zhao Jinghui, read Chairman Mao's quotations: "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." Everyone compared their thoughts with Chairman Mao's words. The more they discussed, the more enthusiastic they became. The commune members couldn't help but shout slogans at the meeting: "Resolutely listen to the Party, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty!" After the meeting, people immediately formed a team to clear the collapsed houses and worked until midnight. Liu Erwu, a demobilized soldier who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, was given the relief supplies from the state by the team after the earthquake, but he refused to accept them no matter what. He said: "I want to use the energy I used to fight against the American invaders on the Korean battlefield to do a good job in production." Now, the commune members of this production team are already measuring the foundations and starting to build new homes.

    奋发图强　自力更生　重建家园　发展生产
    邢台灾区群众发扬革命英雄主义精神
    地震后的抗灾救灾斗争已经取得了重大成就
    新华社邢台十八日电　本社记者报道：邢台地震灾区的群众，用毛泽东思想武装自己，在严重的自然灾害面前顽强奋战，表现了伟大的革命英雄主义精神。
    现在，邢台地震灾区的抗灾斗争已经取得了重大成就。本社记者最近在地震中心地带访问的时候，看到群众已经照常下地生产，许多村庄里按时响起了上工和下工的钟声。有些村庄已经开始重建家园的劳动。灾后的第三天，当地震的余震还在继续、大地有时还微微抖动的时候，一处水利工地上的民工就出工了。整个工地上热气腾腾，压力机发出隆隆的响声。许多村庄里新搭起了标语牌，上面挂着毛主席象，贴着毛主席语录和“奋发图强，自力更生，重建家园，发展生产”的誓言。灾区群众在抗灾斗争中顽强不屈的精神，给了记者极为深刻的印象。
    在灾区访问时，到处可以听到这样一句话：“有毛泽东思想，俺们什么困难也不怕！”在灾区群众讨论生产自救的群众会上，在党员、团员、民兵举行的各种集会上，在“战地医院”的病房里，人们都在朗读和讲解毛主席的语录。有了困难读毛主席的书，人们从毛主席的书里得到了无限的信心和力量。老贫农王洛居，八日清晨地震时从家里跑出来以后，听到邻家有人呼救，立即跑去从倒塌的屋里救出邻居家的四口人。救人刚结束，他又奔到牲口棚，冒着土墙可能倒塌的危险，同别的社员一起把队里的五头牲口全都抢救了出来。这个在旧社会讨过饭、当过长工的老贫农，热爱毛主席的书，在这几天紧张的救灾活动中，他仍然领导着一个学习小组，坚持学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来鼓舞大家积极参加重建家园的斗争。他说：“毛主席的书，是俺们穷人闹革命的书。有毛泽东思想，俺们什么困难也不怕。”他还对记者说：“请全国人民放心吧！困难压不倒俺们。国家在建设，需钱的地方多着哩。受了灾不能老躺在国家身上，俺们自力更生有办法！”
    艰巨的抗灾救灾斗争，也是一堂生动的新旧对比教育课。这里的群众经过这次抗灾斗争，以无比深厚的感情更加热爱社会主义制度，热爱党和毛主席。许多老年人把这次灾害同一九四三年前后三年的遭遇相比，他们说，那几年当地遭到大旱、蝗虫、洪水和日本侵略军扫荡四大灾，人们携儿带女，纷纷逃亡，许多人家妻离子散，家破人亡。这次地震虽然使他们遭到了严重损失，但是党和政府和各方面及时抢救支援，群众情绪稳定，生活得到保障，和旧社会大大不同。六十岁的老大娘何小娥说，解放前那次大灾，她的丈夫饿死了，她带着三个孩子整整讨了三年饭，以后还把一个闺女送了人，才勉强活过来。她流着泪对儿子四印丑说：“儿啊！你可千万别忘了共产党和毛主席，世世代代永远不要忘记。”担任生产队副队长的四印丑在母亲面前表示决心说：“俺是共产党和毛主席养大的，俺一定搞好生产，全心全意为人民服务。”这几天，他忙着给社员盖好简易房子，只给自己家里盖了一个窝棚。
    共产党员和基层干部在严重的自然灾害面前英勇地战斗。在四印丑所在的这个村庄里，传颂着一个年轻的女社员、新入党的四平珍抢救社员的动人事迹。八日凌晨，她被强烈的地震惊醒后，立即披衣冲出屋来。在这时刻，她没有想到别的，而是立即抢救群众。一路上她从塌坍的房子里抢救出一个老大娘和一个小孩，接着又同社员一起救出了三个干部。这时她的手指因为扒瓦砾已经磨破了，但她又接着奔到村东头救出了两个社员。医疗队赶到后，她带着医务人员给社员们治伤，两天两夜没有睡觉。别人劝她休息，她说：“焦裕禄同志说，当群众最困难的时候，共产党员要出现在群众面前。我现在是个预备党员，我要把自己锻炼成一个真正的共产党员！”
    在另一个受灾较重的村庄里，因长期患病有两年没有下地劳动的老党员何庆海，在地震后的片刻时间里，他用双手刨开瓦砾救出了两家人。接着，他又不分昼夜地投入了救灾斗争。他说：“日本侵略军扫荡的时候，我们都坚持了下来，现在这点困难算不了什么。我是老党员，现在正是党需要我起作用的时候！”
    在灾区还传颂着许多基层干部公而忘私的动人事迹。一支部队医疗队在给一名孩子治伤的时候，发现这个孩子的伤不是一下子砸成的，而是慢慢地被重物压伤的。军医向陪送来的家长一问，原来这位家长是生产队的干部，他在房顶塌下来的时候，一人跑到屋外，发现许多房子倒坍，便立即跑去抢救邻居，后来又去看了大队的仓库，回到家找孩子时才发现还压在房子底下，等他扒出来的时候，孩子已受了重伤。也是在这支医疗队里，当军医为一位头部负重伤的社员治疗时，这个社员却叫军医先去救别人，因为他是个干部。
    他说：“替我请求请求，放我回去，我还有许多工作要做。”基层干部在灾害面前表现的高度觉悟和英勇顽强的精神，使医疗队员受到很大教育。
    许多村的党支部，在这次抗灾斗争中发挥了战斗堡垒作用。在一个受灾较重的村庄里，社员们在党支部的领导下正在修理农具和安排种子，为春耕生产作准备。被贫农老饲养员刘洛连在地震时冒着危险救出的牛马，现在喂养得很好。民兵们把国家发的救济物资送到每家每户，整个救灾工作做得有条有理。深夜，参加过南泥湾大生产的老战士、大队党支部书记李振鸿，还同大队其他干部一起，挨家挨户看望社员们住得怎样。李振鸿在地震时头部受伤，但是这几天来全村总是他和干部们最先起床，最后休息。地震后，他经常用当年延安被蒋匪军封锁后人们克服种种困难开展生产自救的事迹，来鼓舞群众自力更生战胜灾害的信心，还领导社员学习毛主席语录。全村社员在党支部的领导下，分成农活、盖房和分配救济物资等几个小组，迅速地恢复了生产和生活秩序。
  象这样的事各地还有许多。另一个生产大队的党支部委员会，一天深夜在一个帐篷里举行了会议，讨论建设新家园的蓝图。党支部委员们在会上热烈发言，他们说：“地震震倒了我们的房屋，但震不倒我们革命的决心！”党支部书记靳景印受了伤，有个十八岁的女儿在房子倒塌时牺牲了，他抑制了悲痛，在会上斗志昂扬地鼓励大家说：“我们一定要象同阶级敌人斗争那样，带领群众向自然灾害作斗争！”
    自力更生的革命精神，正越来越强烈地在灾区群众的抗灾斗争中表现出来。有一天夜里，记者在一个生产队参加社员学习毛主席著作的讨论会。人们聚精会神地听队长赵景会念毛主席的语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”大家用毛主席的话对照自己的思想，越讨论心里越热，社员们在会上情不自禁地呼起口号来：“坚决听党的话，不怕苦，不怕难！”会后人们立即组成一支队伍，清理倒塌的房屋，一直劳动到午夜。参加过抗美援朝战争的复员军人刘二物在地震后，队里把国家的救济物资分配给他，他怎么也不接受。他说：“我要拿出在朝鲜战场上打美国侵略者的劲头来搞好生产。”现在，这个生产队的社员，已经在丈量地基，开始建设新的家园。
