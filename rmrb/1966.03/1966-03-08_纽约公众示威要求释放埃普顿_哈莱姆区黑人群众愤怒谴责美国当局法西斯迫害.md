    New York Public Demonstrations Demand the Release of Epton
    Black Masses in Harlem Angrily Condemn the Fascist Persecution by the American Authorities
    Jagan, Leader of the People's Progressive Party of British Guiana, Calls for the Dismissal of Charges Against Epton
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The fascist actions of the American authorities in illegally arresting and interrogating William Epton, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Labor Party and a Black leader, have aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the American public. They have condemned the atrocities of the American ruling clique and resolutely demanded Epton's release.
    According to the "Challenge" weekly, the organ of the American Progressive Labor Party, after Epton's arrest, more than three hundred New York citizens demonstrated in front of the prison. Carrying placards with slogans such as "Release Epton!", "Imprisoning Epton Will Not Stop Our Struggle," and "The Ku Klux Klan Murderous Police Run Rampant While the Innocent are Arrested," they marched for two hours and distributed leaflets to passers-by, explaining the significance of the demonstration. Participants included workers from the taxi drivers' union, dockworkers, railway workers, students, anti-war movement participants, and slum residents. They chanted slogans along the way. A Black woman pushing a stroller joined the demonstration, saying, "The struggle is united." Some held a demonstration in front of the judge's residence.
    Epton also serves as the chairman of the Progressive Labor Party in Harlem, New York. His arrest has aroused great indignation among the Black residents of Harlem. According to a record of street interviews conducted by a reporter from "Challenge" weekly, an unemployed salesperson said, "The outbreak in 1964 (referring to the Black anti-violence struggle in Harlem) was not a race riot. We revolted against the conditions in the ghetto. The prosecution of Epton is unjust; he has not been given the constitutional right to state his views on the living conditions of Black people. This country claims freedom of speech, but American Black people do not have this freedom; Epton is a living example." A mechanic said that this is "another trick against a true leader of the Black people. We will not forget this frame-up, nor will we forget that those who are framing Epton now are the same enemies who assassinated Malcolm X."
    "Challenge" weekly also reported the statement of support for Epton from the American anti-war group "Vietnam Day Committee," saying, "The New York City and State governments are saying that the Harlem uprising was started and maintained by Epton alone. They are trying to hide the real reasons for the people's anger. The Harlem uprising in the summer of 1964 was caused by the police brutality, high rents, overcrowded housing, and countless other insults endured by Black people in Harlem and other slums across the United States. During the uprising, Epton argued that the people of Harlem had the right to demonstrate against their living conditions. Thus, Epton is clearly being framed. Epton's conviction is not a coincidence at a time when fierce opposition to the Vietnam War is expanding and the U.S. government is intensifying its genocidal war against the Vietnamese people and planning to expand the war to the entire Southeast Asia. Epton strongly opposes the war, and he called on his brothers not to fight against the Vietnamese people, saying, 'The struggle for freedom and liberation is in this country (the United States).' We demand the dismissal of the charges against Epton and the withdrawal of his conviction. We demand the immediate release of Epton."
    "Challenge" weekly also reported some cables from international public figures supporting Epton.
    The New Zealand Workers' Action Movement said in a cable to Epton, "The Workers' Action Movement wholeheartedly supports you and the Progressive Labor Party." Jagan, leader of the People's Progressive Party of British Guiana, said in a cable, "We strongly condemn the conspiracy to accuse Epton of criminal anarchy using the 1964 Harlem uprising. (This matter) shows that American society has not eliminated racial discrimination. All charges must be dropped immediately." (Attached image)

    纽约公众示威要求释放埃普顿
    哈莱姆区黑人群众愤怒谴责美国当局法西斯迫害
    英属圭亚那人民进步党领袖贾根呼吁撤销对埃普顿的控诉
    本报讯美国当局对美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿进行非法逮捕和审讯的法西斯行为，激起美国广大公众的愤慨。他们纷纷谴责美国统治集团的暴行，并坚决要求释放埃普顿。
    据美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》周报报道，埃普顿被捕以后，三百多纽约市民在监狱前面进行了示威。他们手持“释放埃普顿！”、“监禁埃普顿决不能使我们停止斗争”，“三K党杀人警察横行霸道而无辜的人遭到逮捕”等标语牌游行了两个小时，并向路人散发传单，解释示威的意义。参加游行示威的有出租汽车司机工会的工人、搬运工人、铁路工人、学生、反战运动参加者、贫民窟居民等。他们沿途高呼口号。一个黑人妇女推着儿童车参加了示威行列，她说，“斗争是一致的”。有人在法官的住宅前面举行了示威。
  埃普顿兼任进步劳工党纽约哈莱姆区主席。他的被捕引起哈莱姆区黑人居民的莫大愤慨。据《挑战》周报记者在街头与一些行人谈话的记录，一个失业的售货员说，“一九六四年的爆发事件（指哈莱姆区黑人抗暴斗争）并不是种族暴动。我们起义反对聚居区的情况。埃普顿的被控诉是不公道的，他并没有得到宪法规定的权利来陈述他对黑人生活情况的意见。这个国家口称言论自由权，但是美国黑人并没有这个自由，埃普顿是一个活生生的例子”。一个机械工人说，这是“反对黑人真正领袖的又一个把戏。我们不会忘记这个陷害，我们也不会忘记现在陷害埃普顿的人，正是暗杀马尔科姆·爱克斯的同一个敌人”。
    《挑战》周报还报道美国反战团体“越南日委员会”声援埃普顿的言论说，“纽约市政府和州政府正在说，哈莱姆起义是埃普顿一个人发动而保持下去的。它们正在企图隐瞒人民愤怒的真正原因。一九六四年夏天哈莱姆起义是由于哈莱姆区和遍布美国的其他贫民窟中的黑人所忍受的警察暴行、高昂的房租、拥挤不堪的住房和数不清的其他的侮辱造成的。在起义期间，埃普顿主张哈莱姆人民有权举行示威反对他们的生活条件。这样，埃普顿显然是被陷害的。埃普顿的被判有罪是在对越南战争的激烈反对正在扩大的时候，也正是在美国政府加强对越南人民灭绝种族的战争、计划把战争扩大到整个东南亚的时候，这不是偶合。埃普顿强烈反对战争，他呼吁他的兄弟们不要向越南人民作战，他说，‘争取自由和解放的斗争就在这个国家（美国）里’。我们要求取消对埃普顿的控告，撤回对他的判罪。我们要求立即释放埃普顿”。
    《挑战》周报还报道了一些国外公众声援埃普顿的电文。
    新西兰工人行动运动给埃普顿的电文说，“工人行动运动衷心支持你和进步劳工党。”英属圭亚那人民进步党领袖贾根的电报说，“我们强烈谴责利用一九六四年哈莱姆起义事件以犯罪的无政府主义来控告埃普顿的阴谋。（这件事）表明美国社会没有消除种族歧视。必须立即撤销所有控诉各点。”（附图片）
