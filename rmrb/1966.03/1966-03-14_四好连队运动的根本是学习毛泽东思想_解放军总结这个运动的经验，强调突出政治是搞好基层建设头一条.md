    Editor's Note: The company is the grassroots unit of the People's Liberation Army. The PLA strengthens grassroots development by creating the "Four Goods" company movement, laying a solid foundation for all work. This experience is worthy of serious study by comrades on all fronts.
    The task of leading cadres is to grasp the "two ends." One end is to earnestly study and research Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's guidelines and policies; the other end is to grasp the grassroots and grasp living ideas. This is what we often say as using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the "target" of actual work, combining it with the actual situation, and implementing the Party's guidelines and policies.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us to learn to apply the method of leadership that combines leaders and the masses, and combines the general and the individual. Its basic spirit is to urge us to go deep among the masses, deep into the grassroots, to study and summarize the experiences of the masses, and to guide the overall work. The PLA's firm grasp of grassroots work and creation of "Four Goods" companies are precisely in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings. In learning from the PLA, we must also firmly grasp grassroots work, go down to stay at selected points, go to production brigades, production teams, factories, stores, and schools to conduct specific leadership and create experiences to guide the overall situation.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army recently pointed out when summarizing the experience of creating the "Four Goods" company movement: The process of creating the "Four Goods" company movement is a process of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and using politics to command military affairs, command business, and drive all work. The reason why "Four Goods" companies can become even better is the result of giving prominence to politics; the reason why companies that were not good enough to be "Four Goods" can enter the ranks of "Four Goods" is also the result of giving prominence to politics. If we give prominence to politics, work will greatly develop; if we neglect politics, all work will regress.
    The PLA began carrying out the "Four Goods" company movement throughout the army in 1961. Over the past five years, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions to adhere to the "Four Firsts," to firmly grasp grassroots construction, and to root all work in the companies, the various units have repeatedly grasped implementation, laid the foundation, and sought quality, and grassroots construction has been greatly strengthened. Especially in the past year, the various units, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on giving prominence to politics, have launched a larger-scale upsurge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, placing political work at the forefront at all times and in all places. The class consciousness of cadres and soldiers is higher than ever, the political atmosphere is stronger than ever, and the number of "Four Goods" companies is greater than in any previous year, and the quality is also getting better and better. In the face of severe and complex class struggles at home and abroad, they have withstood various tests. In the struggle to defend the borders, coasts, and air defenses, they have been heroic and fearless, and have achieved one victory after another. The company is a university for studying Mao Zedong Thought, and the "Four Goods" company movement has further brought into play the role of this university. In the past year, a large number of new soldiers have grown up rapidly, and a large number of veteran soldiers and grassroots cadres have maintained the good traditions and good work style of the people's army after transferring to the local industrial and agricultural fronts, playing a positive role. Countless facts have proven that the "Four Goods" company movement has become a huge driving force for promoting the PLA's extreme proletarianization and extreme combat effectiveness.
    The conditions for a "Four Goods" company are: good political and ideological work, good "Three-Eight" work style, good military training, and good life management. To become a "Four Goods" company, all four aspects must be good, but good political and ideological work is the first priority and the decisive factor. Over the past five years, the experience gained by various units from practice is that the "Four Goods" movement is a political movement. Whoever gives prominence to politics can win the title of "Four Goods," and whoever neglects politics will lag behind. There was a maintenance station in the Shenyang Military Region that had not been awarded the title of "Four Goods" for several years. The cadres were very anxious. Focusing only on work style did not result in the successful completion of tasks. Focusing only on technology raised the technical level, but did not raise people's awareness, so the tasks were still not completed. Focusing only on life management could not solve the problem. Last year, they seriously summarized their experiences and lessons, placed political and ideological work at the forefront of all work, vigorously grasped revolutionization, and vigorously grasped living ideas, constantly arming the minds of officers and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, the outlook of the maintenance station quickly changed. Cadres and soldiers were in high spirits, had strong fighting will, and did all their work relatively well. At the end of the year, they finally leapt into the ranks of "Four Goods" companies. In the Guangzhou Military Region, there was a company that had won the "Four Goods" title for three consecutive years since the launch of the "Four Goods" movement. Ideological work had always been done very well. The year before last, because of the emphasis on military technology and the weakening of political and ideological work, the result was that military technology was not strong enough, and there were also many ideological problems, so it was not rated as a "Four Goods" company at the end of the year. At the beginning of last year, the company's Party branch first mobilized the masses to summarize their experiences and find lessons, and then led everyone to study Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and other articles, combined with recalling the glorious history of the company, so that everyone further realized that the People's Army has always relied on politics, and that their company was invincible in the past because officers and soldiers had a high degree of class consciousness and a spirit of courage. Some cadres also examined their thoughts of only caring about the immediate goal of "preserving the Four Goods" and "preserving the honor." Afterwards, they gave prominence to politics at all times and in all places. No matter how heavy the task or how tight the time, they always put ideological work first. At the end of the year, all tasks caught up, and they returned to the ranks of "Four Goods" companies. The paths taken by these two units show that there are thousands of ways to improve grassroots construction, but giving prominence to politics is the top priority. If political and ideological work is slightly relaxed, one will go astray.
    How to give prominence to politics, and what to focus on in giving prominence to politics? The experience of many "Four Goods" companies is that the fundamental aspect is to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to work hard on the word "use," truly treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work, constantly link them to reality, transform thoughts, improve work, and guide actions, fundamentally improving the level of awareness of cadres and soldiers. The company where the combat hero Yang Gensi, of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region, was before his death, was rated as "Four Goods" for the fifth time at the end of last year. The reason why this company can continue to advance is because they often organize officers and soldiers to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, use the viewpoint of "one divides into two," and consciously expose contradictions and solve contradictions. Last year, they launched seven such activities to timely find ideological and work style shortcomings and weaknesses in their work. In the continuous process of exposing and solving contradictions, people's thinking became more revolutionary and work became more revolutionary. When the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Railway Corps was repairing roads in the plateau snow-capped mountains, the cadres and soldiers carried Chairman Mao's works with them, learning wherever they went, and using Chairman Mao's words every day to overcome the "self" in their minds and the "difficulties" in their work. Last year, they climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed icy rivers, worked in the open air at minus 30 degrees, and lived in tents covered with snow on all sides. Some soldiers had distracting thoughts. As soon as they thought of what Chairman Mao said, "We are working and fighting to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go, that is the good comrade," they immediately roused their revolutionary spirit and strengthened their belief in overcoming difficulties, and successfully completed their tasks in the remote mountains and rivers, and have been rated as "Four Goods" companies for several consecutive years. They deeply felt from their actual work that Mao Zedong Thought is the pointer and driving force for all work, and that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat force.
    In giving prominence to politics, many "Four Goods" companies also pay attention to grasping and grasping living ideas, and constantly use Chairman Mao's viewpoints to solve various realistic ideological problems of soldiers. The cadres of these companies adhere to the "Five Togethernesses" with the soldiers year after year, timely grasp the signs of thinking, and take different measures to deal with different situations, so that ideological work is done to the soldiers' hearts. In grasping living ideas, these "Four Goods" companies all have a strong political and ideological work team with Party members as the backbone. Their experience is that if political and ideological work is done only by the instructor, it will be deserted, weak and powerless; if political workers, military cadres and the broad masses of soldiers do it together, there will be ideological work in everything and everywhere, so that "good things are praised and problems are grasped by someone." The Fifth Company of a certain unit on the Fujian Front, which has been rated as a "Four Goods" company for five consecutive years, is an advanced collective with strong political and ideological work. The Communist Party members of this company not only play an exemplary leading role everywhere, placing their own ideological revolutionization in the first place, but also are very concerned about the progress of the masses, and often study and report on the ideological situation of the masses, so that the Party branch can discover problems quickly and solve them quickly. The military cadres of this company also pay attention to doing ideological work everywhere. They not only vigorously grasp living ideas in their work, but also constantly educate soldiers with vivid examples in their daily lives, improving their class consciousness in all aspects. In a "Four Goods" company of the Air Force performing decentralized duties, because there is a strong ideological work backbone team, ideological work is very active at each duty station, and some realistic ideological problems among soldiers can be discovered and solved in time, and all work is done very well. They said that political and ideological work is everyone's business. Everyone is both an object of political work and a force for carrying out political work. Hundreds of people see problems, think about problems, and talk about problems, which will form a lively situation in which everyone does political and ideological work.
    In the "Four Goods" company movement, the leading organs and leading cadres of many units generally attach importance to going deep into the companies and the masses, and implementing face-to-face leadership. In order to make the companies always give prominence to politics and not go astray, they often organize grassroots cadres to study Chairman Mao's discussions on politics being the commander and soul, and political work being the lifeline of our army, and to study the resolution of the Enlarged Meeting of the Military Commission in 1960 and the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao. In order to help "Four Goods" companies overcome the idea that "Four Goods has reached the top" and to help companies that have not been rated as "Four Goods" eliminate the mood of "Four Goods is hopeless," they again led all officers and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's "one divides into two" viewpoint during the initial and final evaluations of "Four Goods," to correct everyone's understanding, and to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm for creating "Four Goods" companies. The "Four Goods" movement is a mass-based movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. In order to keep the "Four Goods" movement in a constant state of competition, some units, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on grasping the two ends and leading the middle, both help advanced companies consolidate and improve their existing achievements, so as to make them better and better, and attach importance to helping backward companies summarize their experiences and lessons, and fully mobilize their positive factors to encourage them to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. Some units also actively help advanced companies and backward companies "thread the needle" in the "one help one, one pair red" activities, so that they can form "pairs," so that the experience of advanced companies can blossom and bear fruit in backward companies, and the new achievements and new experiences of backward companies can be used to promote the continued progress of advanced companies, so that the "Four Goods" movement can continue to improve and develop healthily. At present, cadres of various units are resolutely implementing the five principles of giving prominence to politics put forward by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, taking Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work, vigorously grasping living ideas, raising people's awareness higher, and laying a more solid foundation for the companies.

    四好连队运动的根本是学习毛泽东思想
    解放军总结这个运动的经验，强调突出政治是搞好基层建设头一条
    编者按：解放军的基层是连队。解放军通过创造四好连队运动，狠抓基层建设，为一切工作打下坚实的基础。这个经验，值得各个战线的同志们认真学习。
    领导干部的任务是抓“两头”。一头是认真学习和研究毛泽东思想、党的方针政策；一头是抓基层，抓活思想。这也就是我们常说的用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射实际工作之“的”，结合实际情况，贯彻执行党的方针政策。
    毛泽东同志一再教导我们，要学会运用领导和群众相结合、一般和个别相结合的领导方法。它的基本精神，就是要我们深入群众，深入基层，学习和总结群众的经验，指导全盘的工作。解放军狠抓基层工作，创造四好连队，正是按照毛泽东同志的教导作的。我们学习解放军，同样要狠抓基层工作，下去蹲点，到生产大队、生产队、工厂、商店、学校去，进行具体的领导，创造指导全盘的经验。
    新华社十三日讯　中国人民解放军最近在总结创造四好连队运动经验时指出：创造四好连队运动的过程，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用政治统帅军事、统帅业务、带动一切工作的过程。四好连队所以能好上加好，是突出政治的结果，原来不够四好的连队所以能进入四好行列，也是突出政治的结果。突出了政治，工作就会大发展，忽视了政治，一切工作就会退下来。
    解放军在全军范围内开展创造四好连队运动是一九六一年开始的。五年来，各部队根据林彪副主席提出的坚持四个第一，狠抓基层建设，把一切工作的根子扎在连队的指示，反复抓落实，打基础，求质量，基层建设有了极大的加强。特别是去年一年，各部队遵照林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示，掀起更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，时时处处把政治工作摆在首位，干部、战士的阶级觉悟比任何时候都高，政治空气比任何时候都浓，四好连队比任何一年都多，质量也越来越好。他们在国内外严重复杂的阶级斗争中，经受住了各种考验，在保卫边防、海防和空防斗争中，他们英勇无畏，取得了一个又一个胜利。连队是学习毛泽东思想的大学校，四好连队运动更加发挥了这所大学校的作用。过去一年有大批新战士迅速成长起来，大批老战士和基层干部转到地方工农业战线以后，保持了人民军队的好传统、好作风，起了积极的作用。无数事实证明，创造四好连队运动，成了推动全军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的一个巨大动力。
    四好连队的条件是：政治思想好，三八作风好，军事训练好，生活管理好。要成为一个四好连队，四个方面都要好，但是政治思想好是第一位的，是决定因素。五年来，各部队从实践中获得的经验是，四好运动是个政治运动，谁突出政治，谁就能荣获四好，谁忽视政治，谁就要落后掉队。沈阳部队有个机务站，前几年四好称号一直不沾边，干部们很着急，光抓作风，各项任务完成得不好；光抓技术，技术水平提高了，但是人的觉悟没提高，任务还是完不成；光抓生活管理，更不能解决问题。去年，他们认真总结了经验教训，把政治思想摆在一切工作首位，大抓革命化，大抓活思想，不断用毛泽东思想武装指战员头脑。这样，机务站的面貌很快发生了变化，干部和战士情绪高，斗志强，各项工作做得都比较出色，年终终于跃入了四好连队的行列。在广州部队，有一个从开展四好运动以来连续三年获得“四好”称号的连队，思想工作一直做得很好。前年因为大抓军事技术，削弱了政治思想工作，结果军事技术不过硬，思想问题也不少，年终没有评上四好连队。去年年初，这个连队党支部先发动群众总结经验，寻找教训，然后领导大家学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文章，结合回忆连队光荣历史，使大家进一步认识到人民军队历来就是靠政治的，自己连队过去所以能所向无敌，就是因为指战员有高度的阶级觉悟和勇敢的精神。有些干部还检查了只顾眼前
  “保四好”、“保荣誉”的思想。以后，他们时时处处突出政治，不管任务多重，时间多紧，总是把思想工作做在前面，年终各项工作都赶了上来，重新回到四好连队的行列。这两个单位走过的道路表明，搞好基层建设有千条万条，突出政治是头一条，政治思想工作稍一放松，就会走到邪路上去。
    如何突出政治，在突出政治中着重突出什么？许多四好连队的经验是，根本的根本是活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，真正把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，不断地联系实际，改造思想，改进工作，指导行动，从根本上提高干部、战士的觉悟水平。南京部队某部战斗英雄杨根思生前所在的连队，去年年底，第五次评上四好。这个连队所以能不断前进，就是因为他们经常组织指战员认真学习毛主席著作，运用一分为二的观点，自觉地揭露矛盾，解决矛盾。去年一年，他们发动群众进行了七次这样的活动，及时找出思想上、作风上的缺点和工作上的薄弱环节，在不断揭露矛盾、解决矛盾中，人的思想更加革命化，工作更加革命化。铁道兵某部九连，在高原雪山地区修路时，干部和战士身边带着毛主席著作，走到那里，学到那里，天天用毛主席的话克服头脑里的“我”字，工作上的“难”字。去年，他们爬雪山、涉冰河，劳动在零下三十度的露天里，食宿在四面积雪的帐篷中，有的战士思想出现了杂念，一想到毛主席说的：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”就立即振起革命精神，增强战胜困难的信念，在穷山恶水中出色地完成了任务，连续几年都被评为四好连队。他们从实际工作中深深地感到，毛泽东思想是一切工作的指针和前进的动力，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。
    在突出政治中，许多四好连队还注意大抓狠抓活思想，不断用毛主席的观点解决战士的各种现实思想问题。这些连队的干部长年坚持与战士“五同”，及时抓住思想的苗头，针对不同情况，采取不同办法处理，把思想工作做到了战士的心坎上。在抓活思想工作中，这些四好连队都有一支以党员为骨干的坚强的政治思想工作队伍。他们的体会是：政治思想工作光靠指导员一个人去做，就会冷冷清清，软弱无力；政工干部、军事干部和广大战士一起干，就能事事有思想工作，处处有思想工作，做到“好事有人夸，遇到问题有人抓”。连续五年被评为四好连队的福建前线某部五连，是个政治思想工作过得硬的先进集体。这个连队的共产党员不仅处处起模范带头作用，把自己的思想革命化放到首要地位，而且非常关心群众的进步，经常研究和汇报群众的思想情况，使党支部发现问题快，解决问题也快。这个连队的军事干部也处处注意做思想工作，他们不仅在工作中大抓活思想，日常生活中也不断用活生生的事例教育战士，从各方面提高他们的阶级觉悟。在空军一个分散执勤的四好连队里，由于有一支坚强的思想工作骨干队伍，各个执勤点上思想工作都很活跃，战士中的一些现实思想问题，都能及时发现，及时解决，各项工作都做得很好。他们说，政治思想工作是大家的事，大家既是政治工作的对象，又是进行政治工作的力量，成百个人都来看问题，想问题，谈问题，就会形成人人做政治思想工作的活跃局面。
    在创造四好连队运动中，许多部队的领导机关和领导干部普遍重视深入连队、深入群众，实行面对面领导。为了使连队永远突出政治，不走邪路，他们经常组织基层干部学习毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂，政治工作是我军生命线等论述，学习一九六○年军委扩大会议决议和林彪副主席的指示。为了帮助四好连队克服“四好到顶”的思想，帮助没有评上四好的连队消除“四好无望”的情绪，他们又在四好初评和总评时，领导全体指战员学习毛主席一分为二的观点，端正大家的认识，调动大家创造四好连队的积极性。四好运动是群众性的比学赶帮超运动，有些单位为了使四好运动经常保持你追我赶的局面，根据毛主席关于抓两头、带中间的指示，既帮助先进连队巩固和提高现有成绩，做到好上加好，又重视帮助后进连队总结经验教训，充分调动他们的积极因素，鼓励他们学先进、赶先进、超先进。有的单位还在“一帮一、一对红”活动中，积极帮助先进连队和后进连队“穿针引线”，使他们结成“对子”，让先进连队的经验在后进连队开花结果，又用后进连队的新成就、新经验，来促进先进连队继续前进，使四好运动不断提高，健康发展。目前，各部队干部正在坚决执行林彪副主席提出的突出政治的五项原则，把毛主席的书作为各项工作的最高指示，大抓狠抓活思想，把人的觉悟提得更高，把连队的基础打得更扎实。
