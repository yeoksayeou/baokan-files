    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Religious figures in the capital gathered today to commemorate the twelfth anniversary of "Bikini Day" on March 1st, sternly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in detonating a hydrogen bomb over Bikini Atoll, and firmly supporting the anti-American struggle of Japanese religious believers and the Japanese people.
    Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, presided over the meeting. He said that "Bikini Day" is a day for Japanese religious believers and the Japanese people to struggle against the United States.
    Zhang Jie said that U.S. imperialism is currently actively reviving Japanese militarism, and the reactionary Japanese government is betraying the interests of the Japanese people, acting as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism.
    The Japanese Religious Believers Peace Council will hold a memorial service on March 1st at the tomb of Mr. Aikichi Kuboyama, who died from the atomic disaster caused by U.S. imperialism.  Awang Jiatsuo, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, expressed firm support at the meeting on behalf of Chinese Buddhists for the memorial service in front of Mr. Kuboyama's tomb on March 1st, and extended deep condolences to the family of Mr. Kuboyama and the families of other victims.
    Li Chuwen, Secretary-General of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, said that the disaster caused by U.S. imperialism dropping hydrogen bombs on Japan is something that the Japanese people and people all over the world can never forgive.
    Pi Shushi, Chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, pointed out in his speech that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. It colludes with the reactionary Sato government of Japan to revive Japanese militarism, forcibly tying the Japanese people to its war machine, making them cannon fodder for U.S. imperialist wars of aggression. The Japanese people, who possess a strong sense of national self-respect, are unwilling to be subordinate to the United States and have launched a massive anti-American movement. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Japanese people for peace and independence.
    Li Yuhang, Vice President of the Chinese Taoist Association, said that Chinese Taoists resolutely stand in solidarity with Japanese religious believers and the Japanese people to fight to the end against the aggressive wars of U.S. imperialism and to defend world peace.
    A telegram to the Japanese Religious Believers Peace Council was approved at the meeting. Religious figures such as Zhao Puchu, Juzan, Liu Pinyi, Cao Daosheng, Li Depei, and Zhou Shujia also spoke or gave written speeches at the meeting.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: The China Peace Committee for World Peace and the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China recently reiterated in a telegram to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs that the Chinese people will, as always, resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and for independence, democracy, peace, and prosperity. The China Peace Committee for World Peace and the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China sent the telegram to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs for the "March 1st Bikini Day National Conference" in Japan.
    The telegram concluded by expressing the firm belief that this conference will make new contributions to completely thwarting the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, to realizing the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, to promoting the success of the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs this year, and to defending peace in Asia and the world.

    纪念三月一日“比基尼日”十二周年
    我和委会等致电支持日本人民斗争
    首都宗教界集会严厉谴责美帝国主义滔天罪行
    据新华社二十八日讯　首都宗教界人士今天集会，纪念三月一日“比基尼日”十二周年，严厉谴责美帝国主义在比基尼岛上空爆炸氢弹的滔天罪行，坚决支持日本宗教徒和日本人民的反美斗争。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任张杰主持会议。他说，“比基尼日”，是日本宗教徒和日本人民的反美斗争日。
    张杰说，目前美帝国主义正在积极复活日本军国主义，日本反动政府出卖日本人民的利益，正在充当美帝国主义的帮凶。
    日本宗教徒和平协议会将于三月一日在受美帝国主义原子灾害致死的久保山爱吉先生墓前举行纪念会。中国佛教协会副会长阿旺嘉措在会上以中国佛教徒的名义，对三月一日久保山先生的墓前祭表示坚决的支持，并向久保山先生的家属及其他遇难者的家属致以深切的慰问。
    中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会秘书长李储文说，美帝国主义在日本投掷氢弹所造成的灾害，是日本人民和全世界人民决不能饶恕的。
    中国天主教爱国会主席皮漱石在讲话中指出，美帝国主义是世界人民的公敌。它与日本佐藤反动政府勾结，复活日本军国主义，强行把日本人民绑在它的战车上，充当美帝侵略战争的炮灰。富有民族自尊心的日本人民不甘居美帝的从属地位，掀起了声势浩大的反美运动。中国人民完全支持日本人民这一爱好和平和维护独立的正义斗争。
    中国道教协会副会长黎迂航说，中国道教徒坚决同日本宗教徒和日本人民团结在一起，为反对美帝国主义的侵略战争和保卫世界和平而斗争到底。
    会上通过了致日本宗教徒和平协议会电报。在会上讲话和书面发言的，还有赵朴初、巨赞、刘品一、曹道生、李德培、周叔迦等宗教界人士。
    据新华社二十八日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会最近在致日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的一份电报中重申，中国人民将一如既往地坚决支持日本人民反对美帝国主义和争取独立、民主、和平、繁荣的正义斗争。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会是为日本“三月一日比基尼日全国大会”致电日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的。
    电报最后表示深信，这次大会必将为彻底挫败美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，为促进今年第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的成功，为保卫亚洲与世界和平，作出新的贡献。
