    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, Fourteenth. Four types of newly manufactured light plows in Shandong Province have recently been put into mass production.
    The four types of tractor-drawn light plows are: a seven-bottom plow matched with the domestically produced Dongfanghong-54 tractor, a six-bottom plow matched with medium-sized tractors, a light five-bottom plow matched with the Tieniu-45 tractor, and a suspended four-bottom plow matched with the domestically produced Dongfanghong-28 tractor.
    These four types of plows, developed by the Shandong Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, underwent lengthy regional trials and pilot use in the North China region before being formally put into production. They proved to have good tillage quality, a flat surface after plowing, fine soil pulverization, and small furrow dikes, suitable for the requirements of intensive farming. They are more efficient, consume less fuel, and have lower manufacturing costs, and are easier and more labor-saving to operate than the heavy tractor-drawn plows currently used in various places.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, Thirteenth. The Guiding County Tobacco Floss Handicraft Production Cooperative in Guizhou Province has recently successfully trial-produced a vibrating screen for curing tobacco processing, which greatly improves the efficiency of screening tobacco.
    The "Yangbaoshan" tobacco floss, "Shuangyan" tobacco floss, and other famous fine tobacco flosses produced by this tobacco floss cooperative are sold far and wide to Liaoning, Hebei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and other places, in addition to meeting the needs of the province's market. In the past, when producing tobacco floss here, the process of separating impurities was all done manually, requiring several processes such as grain sieves, rice sieves, flour sieves, and silk sieves, which was very inefficient. Each worker could only sieve about 100 jin of tobacco per day. Now, using an electric three-layer vibrating screen, each person can sieve about 1,000 jin of tobacco per day, increasing work efficiency by nine times and greatly reducing labor intensity.
    This vibrating screen was researched and manufactured by tobacco floss workers based on the principle of single-layer vibrating screens for flour processing. It is simple in structure and inexpensive to manufacture. Using this vibrating screen to sieve tobacco can also improve the quality of tobacco floss and make fuller use of raw materials to increase tobacco floss production.

### 山东成批生产四种轻型犁  贵州制成烤烟加工震动筛

    山东成批生产四种轻型犁
    贵州制成烤烟加工震动筛
    新华社济南十四日电　山东省新制成的四种轻型犁最近已成批投入生产。
    这四种机引轻型犁是：为国产东方红—54型拖拉机配套的七铧犁，为中型拖拉机配套的六铧犁，为铁牛45型拖拉机配套的轻型五铧犁，为国产东方红—28型拖拉机配套的悬挂四铧犁。
    由山东农业机械研究所试制成功的这四种犁，在正式投入生产之前都曾在华北地区进行了长时间的区域性试验和试用，证明耕地质量好，耕后地表平整，碎土细，墒沟小，适于农业精耕细作的要求。它们比各地目前采用的机引重型犁效率高，耗油少，而且制造成本低，操作灵便省力。
    新华社贵阳十三日电　贵州省贵定县烟丝手工业生产合作社，最近试制成功烤烟加工震动筛，使筛烟效率大大提高。
    这个烟丝社生产的“阳宝山”烟丝、“双雁”烟丝等各种著名的细烟丝除了供应本省市场需要以外，还远销到辽宁、河北、江西、湖南、广西等地。过去这里生产烟丝的时候，分离杂质的加工过程都是手工操作的，需要通过谷筛、米筛、粉筛、绢筛等几道工序，效率很低，每个工人一天只能筛烟一百斤左右。现在使用电动三层震动筛，每人每天可以筛烟一千斤左右，工作效率提高九倍，而且劳动强度大大降低。
    这种震动筛是烟丝工人根据面粉加工的单层震动筛的原理，研究制造成功的，结构简单，造价便宜。使用这种震动筛筛烟还可以提高烟丝质量，并能更充分的利用原料增产烟丝。
