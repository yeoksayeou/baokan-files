Title: Sato Wants to Lead Japan into New War Adventures, Repeatedly Clamoring to Permanently Fix the Japan-U.S. Treaty and "Defend" Okinawa Together with the United States, Blatantly Advocating Dispatching Troops to Okinawa and Overseas, Not Hesitating to Get Involved in the U.S. Aggressive War

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 11th, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato reiterated on the afternoon of March 10th at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should be permanently fixed.
　　Sato and some senior officials even blatantly advocated during the replies sending troops abroad to participate in the "United Nations forces" that serve the U.S.'s aggression plans.
　　Sato's advocacy of Japan maintaining the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" for a long time is hostile to China. Although he used the excuse that "(the Japanese government) only believes it is necessary to establish a long-term 'defense system' and keep the Japan-U.S. 'security guarantee system' continuing, based on considering China's nuclear armament."
　　Sato also sought excuses in his speech for Japan sending troops overseas. He said something like, "When Okinawa is attacked," Japan can dispatch troops to Okinawa and "not hesitate to get involved in the war."
　　Takatsuji Masami, Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau of Japan, blatantly clamored at the same meeting: "The (Japanese) Constitution allows the (Japanese) 'Self-Defense Forces' to participate in 'United Nations forces' like those dispatched to Lebanon, Congo, the Middle East, and other places."
　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato continued to clamor on the afternoon of March 11th at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that "once" Okinawa, the main U.S. base in the Far East, "is attacked," Japan will dispatch troops to "defend" jointly with the United States.
　　When answering questions from Socialist Party members on this issue, Sato not only did not demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Okinawa, but also deliberately avoided the fact that Okinawa has become a U.S. military base for invading Asia, and desperately used flowery language such as "the sense of unity between Okinawa and the (Japanese) mainland" and "defending compatriots" to defend the conspiracy of dispatching Japanese troops to Okinawa to fight alongside the United States.
　　Fujisaki Manri, Director of the Treaty Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, even brought out the "Japan-U.S. Talks Record" when signing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in 1960 as a basis, saying that it did not restrict Japan from dispatching troops to Okinawa.
　　On the same day, the Sato cabinet also issued a so-called "government view," sophistically arguing that Sato's speech at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors on the afternoon of the 11th was "appropriate."
　　Socialist Party members Kameda Tokuji and Inaba Seiichi pointed out during the questioning that Okinawa has become a U.S. nuclear base, and U.S. troops are launching attacks on Vietnam from here. Therefore, Sato's advocacy of sending troops to Okinawa is to actively get involved in the U.S.-launched aggressive war. They also pointed out that Sato's speech was even more blatant than the speech made by Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in the Diet at the time of the forced passage of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in 1960. They pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi was afraid of the opposition of the Japanese people at the time and did not dare to raise the issue of sending troops to Okinawa to conduct "defense" together with the United States. Sato even raised it. Socialist Party members demanded that Sato declare his speech on the 10th regarding sending troops to Okinawa to be invalid. However, Sato insisted on his position. As a result, all opposition party members walked out, and the meeting was adjourned because it could not continue.

### 佐藤要把日本引向新的战争冒险  一再叫嚷将长期固定日美条约并同美国一起“保卫”冲绳  公然鼓吹向冲绳和海外派出军队不惜卷入美国侵略战争

    佐藤要把日本引向新的战争冒险
    一再叫嚷将长期固定日美条约并同美国一起“保卫”冲绳
    公然鼓吹向冲绳和海外派出军队不惜卷入美国侵略战争
    据新华社东京十一日电　日本首相佐藤荣作十日下午在参议院预算委员会上，再次主张要把日美“安全条约”长期固定下来。
    佐藤和一些高级官员在答辩时甚至公然鼓吹要派兵出国参加为美国的侵略计划服务的“联合国军”。
    佐藤主张日本要长期保持日美“安全条约”是敌视中国的。尽管他借口说什么（日本政府）“只是基于考虑到中国的核武装，才认为有必要建立长期的‘防卫体制’和使日美‘安全保障体制’继续存在下去”。
    佐藤在发言中还为日本向海外派兵寻找借口。他说什么，“冲绳受到攻击时”，日本可以向冲绳出动军队，并且“不惜卷入战争”。
    日本内阁法制局长官高辻正巳在同一个会议上，露骨地叫嚣：“日本‘自卫队’参加象派遣到黎巴嫩、刚果、中近东等地那样的‘联合国军’，（日本）宪法是允许的。”
    据新华社东京十二日电  日本首相佐藤荣作十一日下午在参议院预算委员会上继续叫嚷，美国在远东的主要基地——冲绳“一旦遭到攻击时”，日本将派遣军队，和美国共同“防卫”。
    佐藤在回答社会党议员对这一问题的质询时，不但不要求美军撤出冲绳，还故意逃避冲绳已经成了美国侵略亚洲的军事基地的事实，而拼命地用“冲绳和（日本）本土的一体感”、“保卫同胞”等花言巧语，为向冲绳派遣日本军队和美国联合作战的阴谋辩解。
    外务省（外交部）条约局长藤崎万里在会上竟搬出一九六○年日美“安全条约”签字时的“日美会谈纪要”为根据，说什么它并没有限制日本向冲绳出动军队。
    在同一天，佐藤内阁还发表了所谓“政府见解”，诡辩佐藤十一日下午在参议院预算委员会的发言是“妥当”的。
    社会党议员龟田得治、稻叶诚一等在质询时指出，冲绳已经变成美国的核基地，美军正从这里出发进攻越南，因此佐藤鼓吹的向冲绳出兵，就是要主动卷入美国发动的侵略战争。他们还指出，佐藤的发言比一九六○年强行通过日美“安全条约”当时的首相岸信介在国会上的发言更加露骨。他们指出，岸信介在当时害怕日本人民的反对而未敢提出向冲绳出兵同美国共同进行“防卫”的问题，佐藤竟然提出来了。社会党议员要求佐藤宣布他十日关于向冲绳出兵的发言作废。但是，佐藤坚持他的主张。于是，反对党议员全部退场，会议因无法进行而休会。
