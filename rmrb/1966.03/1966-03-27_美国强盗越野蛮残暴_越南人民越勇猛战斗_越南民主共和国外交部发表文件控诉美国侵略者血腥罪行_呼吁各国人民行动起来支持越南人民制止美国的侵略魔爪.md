    The more barbaric and brutal the American robbers are, the more valiantly the Vietnamese people fight.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issues a document accusing American aggressors of bloody crimes.
    Calling on people of all countries to take action to support the Vietnamese people and stop the aggressive claws of the United States.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 25th - The Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a record of the crimes of destructive war waged by U.S. imperialism in North Vietnam on the 25th. The full text is as follows:
    In 1964, the situation of the American aggressors and their lackeys in South Vietnam became very difficult. In order to salvage its failure in the "special war," U.S. imperialism advocated "bringing the war to North Vietnam" in the form of air force warfare.
    On August 5, 1964, the U.S. Air Force attacked some coastal areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the first time, starting a new stage of the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam.
    Since February 1965, U.S. imperialism has brazenly waged a destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with its air force.
    In the three days of February 7, 8, and 11, 1965, hundreds of planes of the United States and its lackeys attacked many areas in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam near the 17th parallel, especially Dong Hoi City (the capital of Quang Binh Province) and Ho Xa City (Vinh Linh area).
    Since then, for a whole year, the robber attacks by the U.S. Air Force on North Vietnam have been continuous and intense, and the scope has been expanding.
    The planes of the United States and its lackeys, taking off from the Seventh Fleet and from U.S. military bases in South Vietnam and Thailand, bombed from areas near the 17th parallel and the coast, to other areas deep into the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The "escalation" gradually increased from one latitude to another, reaching the Sino-Vietnamese border. Bombing went from intermittent to continuous every day, even day and night. The air force of the United States and its lackeys attacked many residential areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, destroying many economic, cultural, and social welfare facilities.
    According to figures published by Saigon, from February 7, 1965, to November 18, 1965, the U.S. Air Force and its lackeys carried out more than 3,000 attacks on North Vietnam. From February 7, 1965, to November 22, 1965, the planes of the United States and its lackeys made 18,000 sorties, dropping tens of thousands of tons of bombs on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an independent and sovereign country and a member of the socialist camp. The Johnson administration brazenly used its air force to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which exposed its aggressive and bellicose face to world opinion. The U.S. government has trampled on the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam and the most basic principles of international relations, which it had guaranteed to respect. The following lists some of the ironclad evidence of the many barbaric war crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in North Vietnam that even progressive humanity cannot forgive.
    The planes of the United States and its lackeys bombed many residential areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including villages, towns, and some important cities, such as Vinh City and Nam Dinh City. Many economic, cultural, social welfare facilities, and residential areas were destroyed. Vinh City, an important industrial city, was bombed and strafed by robber planes 63 times, with about 1,000 tons of bombs dropped. Son La City, the capital of the Northwest Autonomous Region, was bombed 20 times. Nam Dinh City, the textile industrial complex of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was bombed 10 times. These attacks by the air force of the United States and its lackeys killed many peaceful residents, including the elderly, women, and children. Some families were tragically killed by bombs from American planes. For example, Mr. Duc's family in Dong Hoi City, his mother, wife, children, and his pregnant sister were all killed by U.S. planes on April 4, 1965; Nguyen Luong, a Catholic in Quynh Luu area, Nghe An Province, his wife and two daughters, one and three years old, were killed by U.S. planes on March 15, 1965, and he himself was seriously injured; Mrs. Sinh Dai in Nam Dinh City, herself and her three children, three, seven, and ten years old, were killed in a U.S. air raid on Nam Dinh City.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also attacked peaceful residents in the demilitarized zone near the 17th parallel. According to the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam and the regulations on the demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides, all military activities are strictly prohibited in this area. However, planes of the United States and its lackeys have repeatedly attacked many places in this area, such as the villages of Da Ro, Co Bai, Da Bang, Da Po, and Sa Liet. The areas north of the Hien Luong Bridge, which crosses the Ben Hai River as a temporary demarcation line, have also been bombed by U.S. planes. Hon Co Island, a small island with an area of less than four square kilometers located in the northern part of the demilitarized zone, about 20 kilometers from the coast near the 17th parallel, has also been repeatedly attacked by the United States and its lackeys, reaching 150 times.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also systematically attacked various medical and health institutions in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including more than 30 hospitals, such as specialized lung disease hospitals, specialized leprosy hospitals, provincial hospitals, and county hospitals, as well as medical stations and midwifery stations in various villages, and even the Thanh Hoa Province nursing home for the elderly, which was continuously bombed and strafed by American planes. Some places were bombed and strafed dozens of times. It must be emphasized that all the above-mentioned medical and health institutions have clear Red Cross symbols, which can be identified from a long distance, and these institutions are generally far away from military areas, some located nine to ten kilometers away from transportation hubs. For example, the Quynh Lap Leprosy Hospital in Nghe An Province, for ten consecutive days from June 12 to 22, 1965, U.S. imperialism destroyed 160 houses and various scientific research equipment, as well as various equipment and facilities for the treatment of 2,600 patients, killing 139 patients and doctors and injuring 80 people; on August 7, 1965, the 71st Tuberculosis Hospital in Thanh Hoa Province was heavily bombed, nearly 50 houses were destroyed, 30 people were killed, including five physicians, and many others were injured; U.S. planes also bombed and strafed the Yen Bai Provincial Health Department, hospitals, various epidemic prevention stations, tuberculosis prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations on July 9, 10, and 11, 1965, destroying 30 houses, killing 47 people, most of whom were physicians, medical personnel, pregnant women, and children, and many others were injured.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also bombed and strafed educational institutions in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. To date, more than 120 schools, including one university, 13 normal schools and specialized secondary schools, 90 primary, secondary, and high schools, and 20 kindergartens, have been bombed and strafed by American planes and reduced to rubble. Hundreds of teachers and students, many of whom are children under the age of ten, were brutally killed and injured by American robber planes. Many schools have been destroyed more than once by American planes. For example, the Huong Lap Elementary School in the demilitarized zone was bombed eight times, and the Vinh Teacher's College was bombed with tons of bombs by U.S. planes.
    Recently, after the failure of the United States' so-called "peace seeking," American planes have been frantically bombing the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam day and night, committing many new crimes. On January 31, 1966, American planes attacked a primary school in Hai Hoa Commune, Tinh Gia District, Thanh Hoa Province, killing and injuring 24 primary school students. On February 9, 1966, twelve American planes bombed and strafed the Huong Phuc School in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province, causing casualties to 57 students under the age of fifteen. The frantic attacks by U.S. imperialism on these schools prove that the American aggressor robbers, when they are at their wit's end, do not hesitate to take any barbaric and criminal actions, including dropping bombs on innocent children.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also deliberately destroyed many water conservancy projects in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to create floods, droughts, death, and starvation to threaten and intimidate the Vietnamese people. To date, American planes have bombed and strafed water conservancy projects in Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Ninh Binh, Nam Ha, and Ha Tay provinces. The Chu River agricultural irrigation system in Thanh Hoa Province alone was bombed and strafed 29 times by American planes from April 4, 1965, to August 26, 1965. The main sluice gate of this water conservancy system, the Bai Thuong sluice gate, was bombed and strafed seven times, the Pan Thach sluice gate was bombed eleven times, and the Phong Lac sluice gate was bombed three times. On September 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15, 1965, American planes continuously bombed the Nhi Khe sluice gate in Ha Tay Province. These crimes of the American aggressor robbers are unforgivable to progressive humanity and have aroused the unparalleled anger of millions of conscientious people around the world. From east to west, world opinion has been constantly exposing this extremely malicious and insidious means and conspiracy of the American aggressor robbers. On August 23, 1965, the famous British scholar Lord Russell issued a statement strongly protesting and condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and demanding that it immediately stop the above-mentioned inhuman acts of murder and conspiracy.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also attacked the meteorological observatories and stations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the climate research equipment serving the national economy. To date, more than 30 meteorological observatories and stations belonging to Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, Son La, Lai Chau, Nghia Lo, Yen Bai, Haiphong and other provinces and cities have been destroyed. Some meteorological observatories and stations have been bombed nearly ten times, such as the Tuan Giao Meteorological Station and the Vu Do Meteorological Station. The Son La Meteorological Observatory and the Phu Yen Meteorological Station have been bombed with tons of bombs. American pilots could not have mistaken these meteorological observatories and stations for any military targets, because the meteorological observatories and stations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are established in accordance with the practices of many countries in the world: such as gardens with green grass, fences painted in white, and louvered boxes for placing instruments, and wind columns up to ten to twelve meters high... etc., they all understand these, and they can be identified from high altitude.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also cruelly destroyed many churches and temples, killing priests and monks. For example, Pastor Truong Van Loc of the Qui Hoa Church in Ky Anh District, Ha Tinh Province, and the abbots of the Phuoc Trach Temple, Yang Yu Yun and Nguyen Dan, in Quang Trach District, Quang Binh Province, were killed by American planes. In addition, many Catholics or Buddhists were killed and injured. Among the churches and temples destroyed by American planes are the Thuy Khe Church (Ninh Binh), the Thanh Vinh Church (Thanh Hoa), the Phu Xuan Church and the Vinh Ly Church (Nghe An), the Qui Hoa Church (Ha Tinh), the Tam Toa Church (Quang Binh), etc., and the Vong Cung Temple and the Nam Anh Temple (Nam Ha), the Son Thuy Temple (Ninh Binh), the Giap Hoa Temple and the Dong Tac Temple (Thanh Hoa), the Pu Quang Temple and the Phuoc Trach Temple (Quang Binh), etc.
    The air force of the United States and its lackeys also bombed many markets and other public facilities in various parts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, such as: Ho Xa vegetable market (Vinh Linh), Tuong vegetable market (Ha Tinh), Dung vegetable market and Sa vegetable market (Nghe An), Tu Tru vegetable market (Thanh Hoa), Van Dinh vegetable market (Ha Dong), some bus stations and train stations, as well as farms, construction sites, factories, bridges, and transportation lines, etc., killing and injuring many peaceful residents.
    In short, American planes carried out frantic bombing raids on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, killing many peaceful residents, including children, women, the elderly, teachers, monks, patients, and doctors. The so-called "military targets" and "steel and cement" points of U.S. President Johnson are densely populated areas, hospitals, schools, markets, churches, temples, etc.
    In order to carry out its heinous destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, U.S. imperialism used the latest supersonic jet aircraft, such as: F-100, F-101, F-102, F-104, F-105 jet aircraft, as well as the Air Force's B-57 bombers and the Navy's A-3, A-4, A-6, F-8U, F-4 jet aircraft. In addition, RF-101, RB-57, U-2 and other aircraft and unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft were used to intrude into the airspace of North Vietnam for reconnaissance activities. They also used weapons with enormous destructive power, such as various rockets, 1,500 kg explosives and bombs, Bullpup missiles; used napalm bombs, phosphorus bombs, "lazy dog" bombs (a bomb weighing about eight taels with six copper directional fins that shoots out about 250 steel balls when it explodes), and even used chemical poisons - a weapon that can cause many casualties. Many weapons and war tools were used by the United States for the first time, such as: Bullpup air-to-ground missiles and F-4, F-105 and other supersonic jet aircraft.
    The Johnson government's barbaric bombing and strafing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attacking cities and villages and hospitals, schools, sluice gates, meteorological observatories, markets, temples, churches, etc., where people live, grossly violated human morality and conscience, trampled on the most basic humanitarian principles, and seriously violated the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam and international law.
    In order to defend its extremely blatant acts of aggression and the barbaric crimes committed against the people of North Vietnam, the U.S. authorities have resorted to the means of slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    U.S. imperialism fabricated the so-called "Gulf of Tonkin incident" on the evening of August 4, 1964, as an excuse for its "retaliatory" bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 5, 1964. However, its methods were too clumsy, and its aggressive face has been exposed in the face of world opinion.
    In early February 1965, President Johnson, in explaining the new war actions taken by the United States against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 7th, 8th, and 11th, pointed out that this was a "retaliatory" action taken by the United States against the attacks launched by the South Vietnam Liberation Army against the Pleiku and Qui Nhon U.S. military bases. This reason of the United States has gone bankrupt in the face of world opinion. The Johnson government then used the reason of "stopping aggression from the north" to justify its illegal actions of carrying out increasingly expanded continuous bombing and strafing of North Vietnam since March 1965. However, this new argument of the United States has also been completely refuted by the facts that have occurred in Vietnam.
    Vietnam and the United States are separated by thousands of miles, and the Vietnamese people have never invaded the United States. In the past, U.S. imperialism interfered in Vietnam and helped French colonialists carry out their war of aggression against Vietnam. The Vietnamese people won victory in the First Resistance War, and the 1954 Geneva Accords recognized the national rights of the Vietnamese people, namely: independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. However, U.S. imperialism continues to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of the Vietnamese people: they support the fascist dictatorial puppet regime in Saigon and launched a "special war" against the patriotic movement of the people of South Vietnam. Recently, they sent 200,000 U.S. expeditionary troops to directly invade South Vietnam, carrying out large-scale "sweeps," implementing the "scorched earth policy" of killing all, burning all, and destroying all, and openly using poison gas and chemical poisons on a large scale in South Vietnam, killing innocent people, destroying villages, and committing extremely barbaric crimes against the people of South Vietnam. Thus, only the people of South Vietnam - the victims of U.S. aggression - have the right to legitimate self-defense and retaliation. Under the fierce attacks of the people of South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has expanded the war to the north, clamoring to "retaliate" for its failures and "stop aggression" against South Vietnam. This is the strange logic of a robber who is both incompetent and unreasonable!
    The Johnson government is confident that by using force, it can subdue the Vietnamese people and force them to accept the U.S.'s arbitrary conditions for negotiations. This is simply a fantasy! The "escalation" war waged by the United States in North Vietnam not only cannot shake the people of both North and South Vietnam, but on the contrary, deepens the hatred of all the Vietnamese people towards the American aggressor robbers; the people of both sides of Vietnam are further strengthening their unity and are determined to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of their motherland.
    The army and people of North Vietnam are determined to defeat the repeated invasions of the U.S. Air Force. As of February 7, 1966 - one year after the United States launched its "escalation" war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 874 aircraft of various most modern types, including those of the U.S. Air Force and Navy, have been shot down in the north. Despite the various tactical means employed by the aerial robbers, whether it is a large-scale offensive or a small-scale sneak attack, flying at high altitude or low altitude, coming by day or by night, they have not escaped the air defense fire net of the army and people of the north.
    The army and people of North Vietnam, with their brilliant achievements, have shattered the so-called "U.S. air superiority," proving that with the high spirit of bravery of the soldiers, infantry weapons, and conventional anti-aircraft guns, it is possible to shoot down the latest supersonic jet aircraft, which has disrupted the wishful thinking of the American aggressors. This failure of the United States is acknowledged even by commentators close to the Pentagon, such as Joseph Alsop, in the New York Herald Tribune: "The President's strategy has failed because the North Vietnamese people do not submit because bombs fall on their territory."
    At the same time, the people and armed forces of South Vietnam are launching attacks on the enemy on all battlefields with doubled courage. The earth-shattering achievements established by the South Vietnam Liberation Army and guerrillas in recent times in Ben Cat, Bau Bang, Pleime, Dau Tieng and other places have dealt thunderous blows to the nests of the American aggressors and their lackeys in Saigon, Bien Hoa, Da Nang, Chu Lai, etc. This clearly proves that the destructive war waged by U.S. imperialism in North Vietnam has not reduced, but rather strengthened the fierce attacks of the army and people of South Vietnam against the American aggressors and their lackeys.
    The U.S. authorities' use of the air force to wage a destructive war against North Vietnam has not only failed to achieve the results they had hoped for, but has also suffered very serious political failures in the world and within the United States. The more "escalation" there is in North Vietnam, the more the Johnson government exposes its aggressive and warlike nature, and the more it is met with strong opposition and severe condemnation from progressive humanity. The governments and leaders of socialist countries and many nationalist countries, as well as intellectuals, monks, and prominent figures of many international and national organizations, and public opinion on five continents (to date, including nearly 40 international organizations and more than 350 national organizations in nearly 100 countries) condemn and demand that the U.S. government must stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, that U.S. troops must withdraw completely from South Vietnam, and that the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam must be respected and strictly implemented. Some honest people and some Western governments also disapprove of the U.S. government's proposal to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and demand that the United States must stop this barbaric aggression. Demonstrations held by hundreds of millions of people have continuously broken out in all major cities in the world, putting forward slogans such as "Stop bombing North Vietnam," "Stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam," and "U.S. troops withdraw from South Vietnam." In the United States, strong and widespread movements of various forms have also been launched, from organizing rallies, marches, and holding discussion forums to preventing ships carrying U.S. military supplies from sailing to Vietnam, tearing up draft cards, fasting, refusing to go to kill the people of South Vietnam, and self-immolation, to oppose the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    In short, in American history, the United States has never been so isolated and so strongly opposed by the people of the world as it is now. No American president has been "so much accused and criticized" as President Johnson.
    Looking back on the past year's so-called "U.S. escalation process," the New York Times bitterly admitted on December 4, 1965: "Up to now, escalation has failed. The more escalation there is, the more failure there is, and it brings very serious and huge crises." The Christian Science Monitor believed on December 13, 1965, that "it can be concluded that the first stage (of U.S. escalation in Vietnam) has not brought any victory in any aspect. ......"
    It is clear that after a year of practice, the "gradual escalation" strategy pursued by the United States in North Vietnam has shown that it is no longer the "magic wand" that Johnson had imagined to reverse the U.S.'s predicament in South Vietnam. On the contrary, the more "escalation" there is, the more the American aggressors fail, and the deeper they sink into a more difficult and passive situation.
    Faced with the increasingly strong pressure from world opinion to stop the bombing and strafing of North Vietnam, the U.S. government played the deceptive trick of "suspending bombing" in May 1965.
    Recently, while launching the so-called "peace seeking" offensive, they have again played the trick of "suspending bombing of the north."
    However, wide world opinion has seen through the essence of the U.S.'s "peace seeking" offensive - playing the trick of "suspending bombing" and the "fourteen-point plan" - they are merely tricks to deceive public opinion, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept the conditions in the U.S.'s so-called "unconditional negotiations," and to cover up the U.S.'s conspiracy to step up its aggression against Vietnam. Despite continuous military and political failures, U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam has not changed.
    The U.S. government's blatant destruction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - an independent and sovereign country and a member state of the socialist camp - with its air force is clearly a blatant act of aggression and an extremely brutal and barbaric act of robbery. It goes without saying that the U.S. government must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing, strafing, and other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. government must immediately stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam and must withdraw all U.S. and its vassal troops and weapons from South Vietnam, allowing the people of South Vietnam to solve their own affairs. This is the firm demand of all the Vietnamese people, and this is the urgent demand of progressive public opinion around the world.
    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly call on the governments and people of all socialist countries, the governments and people of all nationalist countries and all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries in the world, as well as the American people, to take active and timely action to stop the bloody aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism extending to Vietnam, and to vigorously support the Vietnamese people's just war against U.S. imperialist aggression.
    For our own part, for the supreme interests of the motherland - independence and freedom, and for the interests of world peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress, the Vietnamese people are determined to realize the strong call issued by our leader President Ho Chi Minh on July 20, 1965:
    "Even if we have to fight for another five, ten, twenty years or even longer, we will resolutely fight until complete victory."
    The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that with their own determination and tenacious efforts, and with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, our patriotic and just struggle will surely achieve a brilliant victory.

### 美国强盗越野蛮残暴　越南人民越勇猛战斗  越南民主共和国外交部发表文件控诉美国侵略者血腥罪行  呼吁各国人民行动起来支持越南人民制止美国的侵略魔爪

    美国强盗越野蛮残暴　越南人民越勇猛战斗
    越南民主共和国外交部发表文件控诉美国侵略者血腥罪行
    呼吁各国人民行动起来支持越南人民制止美国的侵略魔爪
    新华社河内二十五日电　越南民主共和国外交部新闻司二十五日发表关于美帝国主义在越南北方进行破坏性战争的罪行录。全文如下：
    一九六四年美国侵略者及其走狗在越南南方的处境变得十分困难。美帝国主义为了挽救它在“特种战争”中的失败，主张以空军进行战争的形式“把战争引到越南北方”。
    一九六四年八月五日，美国空军第一次袭击越南民主共和国沿海的一些地区，开始了美国在越南进行的侵略战争的新阶段。
    从一九六五年二月以来，美帝国主义悍然以空军对越南民主共和国进行了破坏性战争。
    在一九六五年二月七日、八日和十一日三天中，美国及其走狗的成百架飞机袭击了靠近十七度线的越南民主共和国领土的许多地区，特别是洞海市（广平省会）和胡舍市（永灵区）。
    从此以后，在整整的一年中，美国空军对越南北方的强盗袭击就连续、剧烈地进行，而且范围日益扩大。
    从第七舰队，从美国在南越和泰国的军事基地起飞的美国及其走狗的飞机，从轰炸靠近十七度线和沿海的地区，到日益深入越南民主共和国领土的其他地区进行轰炸，从一个纬度逐步“升级”到另一个纬度，一直升到中越边境。从间隔地进行轰炸到每天都连续轰炸，甚至夜以继日地轰炸。美国及其走狗的空军曾经袭击了越南民主共和国的许多居民区，破坏了许多经济、文化和社会福利等设施。
    据西贡公布的数字，从一九六五年二月七日到一九六五年十一月十八日，美国及其走狗的空军对越南北方进行了三千多次的袭击。从一九六五年二月七日到一九六五年十一月二十二日，美国及其走狗的飞机就出击了一万八千架次，在越南民主共和国领土上投下了成万吨的炸弹。
    越南民主共和国是一个独立和拥有主权的国家，是社会主义阵营的一个成员。约翰逊政府悍然用空军袭击越南民主共和国，这就在全世界舆论面前自我暴露了它的侵略和好战的面目。美国政府已经践踏了它所保证尊重的一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际关系中最起码的准则。以下列举美帝国主义在越南北方所犯下的许许多多连进步人类都不能饶恕的野蛮战争罪行的铁证一部分。
    美国及其走狗的飞机，轰炸了越南民主共和国的许多居民区，包括村庄、市镇和一些重要城市，如荣市、南定市等。许多经济、文化、社会福利设施和居民区遭到破坏。重要的工业城市荣市被强盗飞机轰炸、扫射达六十三次，投下了约一千吨的炸弹。西北自治区首府山萝市被轰炸达二十次。越南民主共和国的纺织联合工业区南定市被轰炸达十次。美国及其走狗的空军的这些袭击，杀害了许多和平居民，其中包括老人、妇女和儿童。有些家庭遭到美国飞机的炸弹杀害的境况是令人伤心的，例如洞海市德先生的一家，母亲、妻子和孩子以及他的怀孕的妹妹都在一九六五年四月四日被美机炸死；义安省琼琉地区天主教徒阮良，他的妻子和两个一岁和三岁的女儿都在一九六五年三月十五日被美机炸死，他自己也受了重伤；南定市的生大娘，她本人及三个三岁、七岁和十岁的孩子都在美机对南定市的一次袭击中被杀害。
    美国及其走狗的空军还袭击靠近十七度线的非军事区内的和平居民。按照一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的规定和双方达成的非军事区的规定，这一地区是严格禁止一切军事活动的。美国及其走狗的飞机却多次袭击这个地区的许多地方，如达罗、固拜、达邦、达坡、沙列等村庄。作为临时分界线的横跨边海河的贤良桥以北等地区也都遭到美机的轰炸；位于非军事区北部的靠近十七度线距海岸约二十公里的、面积不到四平方公里的小岛——昏果岛也遭到美国及其走狗的反复袭击，已达一百五十次。
    美国及其走狗的空军还有系统地袭击了越南民主共和国的各个医疗卫生机构。包括肺病专科医院，麻风病专科医院，省立医院，县医院等三十多所医院以及各乡的医疗站、助产站等医疗卫生机构，甚至供老年人安度晚年的清化省养老院也连续遭到美国飞机的轰炸和扫射。有的地方被轰炸、扫射达数十次之多。必须强调指出的是，所有上述的医疗卫生机构都有着明显的红十字标志，在很远的距离就可以辨认出来，而且这些机构一般都距离军事区域较远，有的设在距离交通要道九到十公里远的地方。例如治疗麻风病的义安省琼立医院，从一九六五年六月十二日到二十二日的一连十天中，美帝国主义共破坏了一百六十幢房子和各种科学研究设备，以及供二千六百名病人治疗的各种设备设施，使一百三十九名病人和医生遭到死亡，八十人受伤；一九六五年八月七日，清化省七一肺结核医院遭到猛烈轰炸，近五十幢房屋被炸毁，三十人死亡，其中有五位医师，还有许多人受伤；美国飞机还在一九六五年七月九、十、十一日三天中向安沛省的卫生厅、医院、各防疫卫生站、防痨病站、妇幼保健站等进行轰炸、扫射，炸毁三十幢房屋，杀害了四十七人，其中大部分是医师，医务人员，孕妇和小孩，还有许多人受伤。
    美国及其走狗的空军还对越南民主共和国的教育机构进行轰炸和扫射。到目前为止，一百二十多所学校，其中有一所大学、十三所师范学校和专科中学、九十所第一、二、三级普通学校和二十所幼儿园遭到美国飞机的轰炸和扫射，成为废墟。成百名教师和学生，其中有许多是十岁以下的小孩，惨遭美国强盗飞机的杀害、杀伤，不少学校不止一次地遭到美机的破坏，例如位于非军事区的香立小学就遭到八次轰炸，荣市师范大学被美机投下了成吨的炸弹。
    最近，在美国的所谓“寻求和平”失败以后，美国飞机又日夜地狂轰滥炸越南民主共和国领土，犯下了许多新的罪恶。一九六六年一月三十一日，美国飞机袭击清化省静嘉县海和乡的小学，炸死、炸伤小学生二十四名。一九六六年二月九日，十二架美国飞机对河静省香溪县香福学校进行轰炸、扫射，五十七名十五岁以下的学生遭到伤亡。美帝国主义对这些学校的疯狂袭击证明，美国侵略强盗在他们走投无路时，不惜采取任何野蛮的罪恶行为，包括把炸弹投在无辜的小孩头上。
    美国及其走狗的空军，还蓄意破坏越南民主共和国的许多水利工程，企图造成水灾、旱灾、死亡和饥饿来威胁、恫吓越南人民。到目前为止，美国飞机已经轰炸、扫射了清化、义安、河静、广平、宁平、南河、河西等省的水利工程。仅清化省内的朱江农田水利系统，从一九六五年四月四日到一九六五年八月二十六日，就被美国飞机轰炸、扫射达二十九次。这个水利系统的主要水闸——沛上水闸被轰炸、扫射了七次，盘石水闸被炸十一次；丰乐水闸被炸三次。一九六五年九月九、十、十一、十二、十四和十五日，美国飞机对河西省二溪水闸连续进行轰炸。美国侵略强盗的这些罪行是进步人类所不能饶恕的，它激起了世界上成百万有良知的人们的无比愤怒。从东到西，世界舆论不断纷纷揭露美国侵略强盗的这种极其恶毒和阴险的手段和阴谋。一九六五年八月二十三日，英国著名学者罗素勋爵发表声明，强烈抗议和谴责美帝国主义的罪行，要求它立即停止上述的惨无人道的杀人行为和阴谋。
    美国及其走狗的空军还袭击越南民主共和国的气象台、站和为国民经济服务的气候研究的设备。到目前为止，已有三十多所属于广平、河静、义安、清化、山萝、莱州、义路、安沛、海防等省市的气象台、站被炸毁。有的气象台、站被轰炸近十次，如巡教气象站、宇岛气象站。山萝气象台、符晏气象站都被投下成吨的炸弹。美国飞行员不可能把这些气象台、站误认为任何军事目标，因为越南民主共和国的气象台、站都按照世界上许多国家惯例设立的：如园地有青草，有涂着白漆的栅栏和放置仪器的百叶箱子，有高达十米——十二米的风柱……等等，这些它们都全懂，而且在高空就可以辨认出来。
    美国及其走狗的空军还残酷破坏许多教堂，寺庙，杀害牧师、僧侣，例如河静省其英县归和教堂的张文禄牧师、广平省广泽县福泽乡寺院主持和尚杨玉蕴和阮旦等都是被美国飞机炸死。此外，还有许多天主教徒或佛教徒被炸死炸伤。在遭到美国飞机破坏的教堂和寺庙中，有水基教堂（宁平）、清永教堂（清化）、富春教堂和永丽教堂（义安）归和教堂（河静）、三座教堂
  （广平），等等，有望宫寺和南英寺（南河）、山水寺（宁平）、甲华寺和东则寺（清化）、普光寺和福泽寺（广平）等等。
    美国及其走狗的空军还轰炸越南民主共和国各地的许多市场和其他公共设施，如：胡舍菜市（永灵）、象菜市（河静）、容菜市和砂菜市（义安）、四柱菜市（清化）、云亭菜市（河东），一些汽车站和火车站，以及农场、工地、工厂、桥梁和交通运输线等，炸死、炸伤许多和平居民。
    总之，美国飞机对越南民主共和国领土进行了狂轰滥炸，杀害了许多和平居民，包括儿童、妇女、老人、教员、修士、病人和医生等。美国总统约翰逊所谓的“军事目标”和“钢骨水泥”点，就是居民稠密地区、医院、学校、市场、教堂、寺庙等等。
    美帝国主义为了对越南民主共和国进行罪恶的破坏性战争，使用了最新式的超音速喷气式飞机，如：F—100型、F—101型、F—102型、F—104型、F—105型喷气式飞机，以及空军的B—57型轰炸机和海军的A—3型、A—4型、A—6型、F—8U型、F—4型喷气式飞机。此外，还使用RF—101型、RB—57型、U—2型等飞机和无人驾驶高空侦察机侵入越南北方上空进行侦察活动。它们还使用具有巨大破坏力的武器，如各种火箭、一千五百公斤重的炸药和炸弹、小斗犬式导弹；使用了凝固汽油弹、磷质炸弹、“懒狗”炸弹（一种重约八公两的有六片铜质定向翼、爆炸时射出约二百五十颗钢珠的炸弹），甚至还使用了化学毒药——一种能使很多人伤亡的武器。有许多种武器和战争工具是美国第一次试用的，如：小斗犬式空对地导弹和F—4型、F—105型等超音速喷气式飞机。
    约翰逊政府使用空军野蛮地轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国，袭击人民聚居的城市、乡村和医院、学校、水闸、气象台、市场、庙宇、教堂等，粗暴地违反了人类的道德和天良，践踏了最起码的人道原则，极其严重地违反了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际法。
    美国当局为了替自己的极其露骨的侵略行为和对越南北方人民所犯下的野蛮罪行辩护，不惜玩弄了诬蔑越南民主共和国的手段。
    美帝国主义制造了所谓一九六四年八月四日晚上的“北部湾事件”，以作为它在一九六四年八月五日对越南民主共和国进行“报复”性轰炸的借口。但是，它的手法太过于拙劣了，它的侵略面目已经在世界舆论的面前暴露无遗。
    一九六五年二月初，约翰逊总统就美国于七日、八日和十一日对越南民主共和国采取的新的战争行动进行解释时指出，这是美国对越南南方解放军向波来古和归仁美军基地发动进攻而采取的“报复”行动。美国的这一理由在世界舆论面前破产了，约翰逊政府于是又以“制止来自北方的侵略”的理由来为它们自一九六五年三月以后对越南北方进行日益扩大的连续的轰炸和扫射的非法行为进行辩护。但是，美国的这个新的论点也已经被在越南发生的事实完全驳倒了。
    越南与美国相隔成万里，越南人民从来没有侵犯美国。过去，美帝国主义曾经干涉过越南帮助法国殖民主义者进行侵略越南的战争。越南人民在第一次抗战中取得了胜利，一九五四年日内瓦协议承认了越南人民的各项民族权利，即：独立、主权、统一和领土完整。但是美帝国主义仍然继续粗暴地干涉越南人民的内部事务：它们扶植了西贡的法西斯独裁走狗政权，发动了“特种战争”，来反对越南南方人民的爱国运动。最近，他们派出了二十万美国远征军直接侵略越南南方，大肆进行“扫荡”，实行杀光、烧光、毁光的“焦土政策”，并且公开地在越南南方大规模使用毒气和化学毒药，杀害无辜人民，破坏村庄，对越南南方人民犯下了极其野蛮的罪行。这样，只有越南南方人民——美国侵略的受害者，才有权进行正当的自卫和报复。在越南南方人民的猛烈打击下，美帝国主义又把战争扩大到北方，叫嚷要为它的失败“报复”和“制止侵略”越南南方。这是既无能又理亏的强盗的奇怪逻辑！
    约翰逊政府满以为使用武力，就可以使越南人民屈服，迫使越南人民接受美国横蛮的条件进行谈判。这简直是幻想！美国在越南北方进行的“升级”战争，不仅不能使越南南北两方人民动摇，相反地更加深了全体越南人民对美国侵略强盗的仇恨；越南两方人民更加增强团结，决心为祖国的独立和自由战斗到底。
    越南北方军民坚决打败美国空军的屡次进犯。截至一九六六年二月七日——美国对越南民主共和国进行“升级”战争的一年后，包括美国空军、海军的各种最现代化类型的八百七十四架飞机在北方被击落了。尽管空中强盗玩弄了各种战术手段，但不管是大规模进攻还是小股偷袭，高空飞行还是低空飞行，白天来还是晚上来，它们都没有逃脱了北方军民的防空火网。
    越南北方军民以自己的辉煌战绩粉碎了所谓“美国空中优势”，证明了凭着战士们的高度勇敢精神、步兵的武器和常规的高射炮是可以打下最新式的超音速喷气式飞机的，这就打乱了美国侵略者的如意算盘。美国的这一失败连接近五角大楼的评论家约瑟夫·艾尔索普也在《纽约先驱论坛报》上承认道：“总统的战略已失败，因为北越人民并不因为炸弹落到他们的领土上而屈服”。
    与此同时，越南南方人民和武装力量以双倍勇猛的气势连续地在各个战场上向敌人展开进攻。南方解放军和游击队过去期间在文相、保邦、波来梅、油汀等地所建立的惊天动地的战绩，给予美国侵略者及其走狗在西贡、边和、岘港、朱莱等地的巢穴以雷霆般的打击。这一点清楚地证明，美帝国主义在越南北方进行的破坏性战争丝毫没有减少反而加强了越南南方军民对美国侵略者及其走狗的猛烈进攻。
    美国当局利用空军对越南北方进行的破坏性战争，不仅没有达到象它们所希望那样的结果，而且在世界和美国国内却遭到非常惨重的政治方面的失败。在越南北方越是“升级”，约翰逊政府越暴露了它的侵略和好战成性的面目，越遭到进步人类的强烈反对和严厉谴责。社会主义各国和许多民族主义国家的政府和领导人，以及许多国际和国家组织的知识界、修士、知名人士，五大洲舆论（截至目前为止，包括近四十个国际组织和近一百个国家的三百五十多个国家组织）谴责和要求美国政府必须停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，美国军队必须从越南南方全部撤走，必须尊重和严正施行一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。一些正直的人和一些西方国家政府也不赞成美国政府轰炸越南民主共和国的主张，并要求美国必须停止这种蛮横的进攻。世界上所有大城市都连续爆发了数以亿计的人们举行的示威，提出了“停止轰炸北越”，“停止侵略越南南方的战争”，“美国军队从越南南方撤走”等口号。在美国国内，也掀起了形式多种多样的强烈、广泛的运动，从组织集会、游行、开讨论会到阻止运进美国军事物资的船只开往越南，撕毁征兵证、绝食、不愿去杀害越南南方人民、自焚等，来反对约翰逊政府对越南的侵略政策。
    总之，在美国历史上，美国从来没有象现在这样遭到孤立和受到世界人民的强烈反对。从来没有一个美国总统象约翰逊总统这样受到“这样多的指责和批判。”
    回顾一年来的所谓美国“升级过程”，一九六五年十二月四日，《纽约时报》辛酸地承认：“到现在，升级已经失败。越升级就越失败，而且带来非常严重和巨大的危机”。《基督教科学箴言报》一九六五年十二月十三日认为“可以作出这样的结论，
  （美国在越南升级）的第一个阶段在各方面并没有带来任何胜利。……”
    很明显，经过一年的实践，美国在越南北方推行的“逐步升级”战略，已经表明不再是约翰逊所幻想那样的扭转美国在越南南方窘境的“魔杖”。相反，越“升级”，美国侵略者就越失败，就越深陷于更加困窘、被动的局面。
    面对世界舆论日益强烈地要求停止对越南北方的轰炸、扫射的压力，美国政府在一九六五年五月间玩弄了“暂停轰炸”的欺骗手段。
    最近，它们在展开所谓“寻求和平”攻势的同时，又玩弄
  “对北方暂停轰炸”的把戏。
    但是，世界广泛舆论已拆穿了美国的“寻求和平”攻势——玩弄“暂停轰炸”和“十四点计划”的把戏——的实质，它们只不过是欺骗舆论的伎俩，企图迫使越南人民接受美国的所谓“无条件谈判”中的条件，掩盖美国加紧侵略越南的阴谋。尽管在军事和政治上不断遭到失败，美帝国主义在越南的侵略政策仍然没有改变。
    美国政府公然用空军破坏越南民主共和国——一个独立和拥有主权的国家、社会主义阵营的成员国之一，这很显然是一种明目张胆的侵略行动，是一种极其粗暴和野蛮的强盗行径。美国政府必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其他的战争行动，这是理所当然的事情。美国政府必须立刻停止对越南南方的侵略战争，必须把美国及其仆从的军队和武器全部撤出越南南方，让越南南方人民自己解决自己的事务。这是全体越南人民的坚决要求，这是全世界进步舆论的迫切要求。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府恳切呼吁各个社会主义国家的政府和人民，各个民族主义国家和世界上爱好和平和主持正义的各国政府和人民，以及美国人民，积极和及时地行动起来，以便制止美帝国主义伸向越南的血腥的侵略魔爪，有力地支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争。
    在我们自己方面，为了祖国的最高利益——独立和自由，为了世界的和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的利益，越南人民坚决实现自己的领袖胡志明主席于一九六五年七月二十日发表的强有力的号召：
    “即使要再战斗五年、十年、二十年甚至更长的时间，我们也要坚决战斗到完全胜利。”
    越南人民深信，以自己的决心和顽强的努力，并得到全世界人民的同情和支持，我们的爱国正义斗争事业一定取得辉煌的胜利。
