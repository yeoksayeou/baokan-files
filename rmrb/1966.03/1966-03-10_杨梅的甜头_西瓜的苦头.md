    The Sweetness of Yangmei, The Bitterness of Watermelon
    Yangmei, as a commodity, is delicate and easily perishable, not suitable for long-term storage. Last year, we reversed our past practice of passively waiting for production departments to sell and retail units to buy. We proactively connected with production units, and planned to organize the source of goods, organizing direct meetings between production, supply and sales parties. In this way, the effect was very good, supporting production and facilitating retail.
    Why were we able to do this? The main reason is that politics took command. Before the large-scale marketing of Yangmei in May and June, we conducted repeated inspections and criticisms among employees, especially leading cadres, comparing individual thoughts and work, to criticize purely business viewpoints and capitalist management ideas, so that the idea of serving production and the people's lives penetrated everyone's minds. All employees used their brains and came up with many good methods, and the work of managing Yangmei was better than any previous year.
    However, amidst the praise from all sides, we were overwhelmed by victory and believed that with the precedent of managing Yangmei, there would be no mistakes in managing watermelon. We relaxed our political and ideological work and did not do a good job of investigation, research and organization in advance. As a result, when the watermelons came onto the market, we sometimes called and telegraphed the production areas, requesting them to delay or stop delivery, and sometimes sent people to the production areas to urge delivery. This stop-and-start manner caused great dissatisfaction in the production areas, who criticized us for "using people when you need them, and ignoring them when you don't." "You want more when there are few watermelons, you don't want them when there are many, and you urge for them when there are none." "You thought of everything, whether there would be many, few, losses or profits, but you didn't think about production."
    The examples of Yangmei and watermelon vividly illustrate two kinds of thoughts and two kinds of work styles, resulting in two kinds of results, which made us deeply feel the importance of highlighting politics at all times and in all matters.
    Hong Yong, Secretary of the Party General Branch of Tianjin City Dry and Fresh Fruit Company
    Editor's Note: Highlighting politics is not empty; it must be manifested in practical work. Thought governs people's actions. A slight difference in thought, whether to highlight politics or not, will produce two different effects in practice. "The sweetness of Yangmei, the bitterness of watermelon," doesn't this illustrate this vividly?

    杨梅的甜头  西瓜的苦头
    杨梅这种商品，娇嫩易烂，不宜久存。去年我们一反过去坐等生产部门来卖、坐等零售单位来买的做法，主动和生产单位挂钩，有计划地组织货源，组织产供销三家直接见面。这样，效果很好，支持了生产，又便利了零售。
    为什么能够这样作呢？主要是政治挂了帅。五六月份杨梅大量上市以前，我们就在职工中，特别在领导干部中，对照各个人的思想和工作，反复检查和批判了单纯业务观点和资本主义经营思想，使为生产服务、为人民生活服务的思想钻进了大家的头脑。全体职工开动脑筋，想出了许多好办法，经营杨梅的工作做得比哪一年都好。
    可是在各方面的赞扬声中，我们被胜利冲昏了头脑，认为有了经营杨梅的先例，经营西瓜也不会出漏子，便放松了政治思想工作，事先也没有做好调查研究和组织工作。结果，西瓜上市了，时而给产地打电话，拍电报，要求缓发、停发，时而派人到产地催发。这样忽停忽发，产地意见很大，批评我们是“用人朝前，不用人朝后”。“瓜少了多要，瓜多了不要，瓜没了催要”。“你们对多、少、赔、赚，什么都想到了，就是没想到生产”。
    杨梅和西瓜的事例，生动地说明了两种思想、两种作风，得出的两种结果，使我们深深感到时时、事事都必须突出政治的重要性。天津市干鲜果品公司党总支书记  洪  涌
    编者注：突出政治不是空的，它必须在实际工作中表现出来。思想支配人的行动，一念之差，是突出政治还是不突出政治，就会在实践中产生两种不同的效果。“杨梅的甜头，西瓜的苦头”，不是很生动地说明了这一点吗？
