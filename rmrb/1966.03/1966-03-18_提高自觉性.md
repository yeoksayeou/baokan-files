	“At present, emphasizing politics is not yet a very conscious concept in the ideological leadership of county committees.” This is the experience of county committee comrades in several counties in Zhejiang Province.

	Generally speaking, county committees conduct their work according to the Party's guidelines and policies. Aren't the Party's guidelines and policies politics? Why is it said that some county committees are not conscious?

	Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Many comrades often remember the specific and individual work lines and policies of our Party, but forget our Party's general line and general policy. And if we truly forget our Party's general line and general policy, we will be a blind, incomplete, and unclear revolutionary. When we implement specific work lines and specific policies, we will lose our direction, waver from left to right, and delay our work."

	On the issue of emphasizing politics, some comrades are not conscious and have a blind spot, to a large extent, because these comrades cannot escape the circle of daily affairs and are blocked from political vision by some routine work, unable to see the large amount of class struggle and the struggle between two roads. They are unaware or only partially aware of what path to lead the masses on, what kind of production to engage in, who to rely on, and what kind of enterprise to create. When there are achievements in production, they do not understand how the achievements came about; when problems arise in work, they cannot figure out where the root cause of the problem lies.

	To enhance the consciousness of emphasizing politics is to enhance the consciousness of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The more Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of leading cadres of county committees, the sharper their political vision will be, and they will be able to grasp the main contradictions in work and production, and have a clear direction in any situation.

	Our county committee comrades generally have relatively rich practical experience, but the problem is that some comrades have not used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and summarize it, and many understandings still remain at the perceptual stage. Connecting theory with practice, studying earnestly, practicing earnestly, and summarizing earnestly are the fundamental methods to enhance the consciousness of emphasizing politics.

    提高自觉性
    “目前，突出政治，在县委领导思想上还不是很自觉的”。这是浙江省几个县的县委同志的体会。
    一般说来，县委都是根据党的方针政策进行工作的。党的方针政策还不是政治吗？为什么说有的县委还不自觉呢？
    毛泽东同志说：“许多同志往往记住了我党的具体的各别的工作路线和政策，忘记了我党的总路线和总政策。而如果真正忘记了我党的总路线和总政策，我们就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，在我们执行具体工作路线和具体政策的时候，就会迷失方向，就会左右摇摆，就会贻误我们的工作。”
    在突出政治的问题上，有些同志所以不自觉，有盲目性，在很大程度上，是由于这些同志跳不出日常事务的圈子，被一些事务工作挡住了政治视线，看不到大量存在的阶级斗争和两条道路斗争；对于领导群众走什么样的道路，搞什么样的生产，依靠什么人，创什么业，也就不知不解或者是半知半解。生产上有了成绩，不了解成绩是怎样来的；工作中出了问题，弄不清问题的根源在那里。
    提高突出政治的自觉性，就是提高活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性。县委领导干部头脑中的毛泽东思想越多，政治眼光就越锐利，就能抓住工作和生产中的主要矛盾，在任何情况下都能有明确的方向。
    我们的县委同志一般有比较丰富的实践经验，问题在于有些同志没有用毛泽东思想加以分析总结，许多认识还停留在感性阶段。联系思想，认真学习，认真实践，认真总结，是提高突出政治的自觉的根本方法。
