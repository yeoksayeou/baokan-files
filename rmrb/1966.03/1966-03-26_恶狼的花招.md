　　The Tricks of the Evil Wolf
　　Leng Ran
      "Today we live in a false peace. Our diplomats and our leaders have not really led us toward true peace." The head of the US "Peace Corps," Jack Hood Vaughn, recently said this gloomily in a speech in Africa. Immediately following, he announced in a hopeful tone: "The world has finally found a real movement to achieve peace"—this is the US "Peace Corps."
    It seems that Mr. Vaughn is quite proficient in the advertising techniques of Madison Avenue. With a small propaganda trick, the US "Peace Corps" becomes the unique treasure guaranteeing the realization of world peace.
    But haven't Johnson and Rusk also been swearing that they are truly leading the world towards true peace? Why does the head of the US "Peace Corps" openly denounce them as "false" in front of the African people?
    Mr. Vaughn does this because he has no choice.
    Shortly after the US "Peace Corps" was launched, one of the main planners of this organization, US Congressman Ruth, announced that an important task of the "Peace Corps" was to "help make American foreign policy warm and humane." But even if the evil wolf keeps its lips tightly closed, people still know that it has ferocious fangs in its mouth; how can the American imperialists, by creating a group of "Peace Corps," make the people of the world think that its policy of aggression and war is in any way "warm" and "humane"? Over the years, although the United States has sent many "Peace Corps" to Africa, the African people have increasingly realized the sinister face of American neocolonialism from the education of facts. Not long ago, the American journal *Foreign Affairs* had to admit in an article: "American policy toward Africa, in the minds of a large part of the African continent, has largely lost credibility."
    Precisely because of this, Mr. Vaughn had to adopt new tactics when peddling the US "Peace Corps" in Africa. He also made some slight criticisms of American diplomats and leaders, in an attempt to make the African people believe that the "Peace Corps" is not on the same path as American diplomats and leaders, but is a genuine "peace brand."
    But everyone knows that the US "Peace Corps" is an institution under the leadership of the US government, just as the wolf's lips are part of the wolf. If an evil wolf claims that its teeth will bite people but its lips are kind, no one will believe it and be willing to accept its kiss. Can this wolf-like trick of the head of the US "Peace Corps" deceive anyone?

    恶狼的花招　
　  冷然
      “今天我们生活在虚假的和平中。我们的外交官和我们的领导人没有真正地使我们走向真正的和平。”美国“和平队”的头子杰克·胡德·沃恩最近在非洲发表的一次讲话里这样阴郁地说。紧接着，他又用一种充满希望的声调宣布：“世界终于找到了一个实现和平的真正运动”——这就是美国的“和平队”。
    看来，沃恩先生对于麦迪逊大街的广告术是颇为精通的。他用了一个小小的宣传手法，美国“和平队”就成为保证实现世界和平的独一无二的宝贝了。
    但是，约翰逊和腊斯克之流不是也一直赌咒发誓地说他们是在真正地使世界走向真正的和平吗？为什么美国“和平队”的头子居然公开在非洲人民面前把他们也说成是“虚假”的呢？
    沃恩先生这样做，是有不得已的苦衷的。
    在美国“和平队”出笼后不久，成立这个组织的主要策划人之一、美国众议员鲁斯就宣布：“和平队”的一个重要任务就是“帮助把美国外交政策变得温暖和人道”。但是，恶狼即使紧闭双唇，人们仍然知道它嘴里长着凶残的獠牙；美帝国主义搞了一批“和平队”，又怎么能使世界人民认为它的侵略政策和战争政策有什么
  “温暖”和“人道”呢？几年来，尽管美国向非洲派遣了不少“和平队”，但是非洲人民从事实的教育中越来越清楚地认识了美国新殖民主义的狰狞面目。不久前，美国《外交季刊》在一篇文章里就不得不承认：“美国对非洲的政策，在非洲大陆一大部分人的心目中，已经在很大程度上丧失了信誉。”
    正是由于这样，沃恩先生在非洲兜售美国“和平队”的时候，不得不采用新的手法。他对美国的外交官和领导人也轻描淡写地作一些非议，无非是企图使非洲人民相信，“和平队”同美国的外交官和领导人并非一路货色，而是真正的“和平牌”。
    但是，谁都知道，美国的“和平队”是美国政府领导下的机构，正如同狼的嘴唇是狼的一部分一样。如果一头恶狼声称它的牙齿虽然要咬人而它的嘴唇却是善良的，决没有人会信以为真而愿意接受它的接吻。美国“和平队”头子的这种恶狼式的花招难道能骗得了谁吗？
