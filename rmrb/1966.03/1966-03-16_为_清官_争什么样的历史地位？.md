    What Kind of Historical Status Should Be Sought for "Upright Officials"?
    Li Qing, a Soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Summary: Comrade Fang Shi obliterates the essence of "upright officials" and treats them as the driving force of historical development, which is completely absurd. His efforts to win historical status for "upright officials" are actually efforts to win historical status for the feudal landlord class.
    Comrade Fang Shi's "Questioning (On the Appraisal of the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office')" (published in the "People's Daily" on February 3 this year) is an article defending "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and arguing for the status of Hai Rui and historical "upright officials." Here, I would like to raise some opinions on the "upright official" issue for discussion with Comrade Fang Shi.
    Comrade Fang Shi begins by stating that if "upright officials" and corrupt officials are considered to be "the same thing," then there is "no need to study history." He quotes Comrade Yao Wenyuan's statement: "Fundamentally speaking, no matter how 'upright' or 'good' the 'upright officials' or 'good officials' are, they can only be 'upright officials' or 'good officials' of the landlord class who exercise dictatorship over the peasants, and not the opposite." However, Comrade Fang Shi precisely ignores the five important words "fundamentally speaking." What is "fundamental"? It is class essence. Can it be said that, from the perspective of class essence, "upright officials" and corrupt officials are not "the same thing"? This is a class boundary that must never be denied.
    Some people shout loudly, using "one divides into two" as an excuse, to praise "upright officials." It is said that although "upright officials" are members of the ruling class, they are "standing on the side of the people." Comrade Fang Shi actually believes that Hai Rui is such an "upright official." This is completely classless dream talk. In feudal society, how could there be an official who is both loyal to the emperor and the landlord class and "good" to the people, a "two-in-one" official? Comrade Fang Shi admits on the one hand that "obliterating the class essence of 'upright officials'... is obviously a serious error of principle," but on the other hand, he is unwilling to admit that "fundamentally speaking," "upright officials" and corrupt officials are "the same thing." How contradictory is this!
    Some people who praise "upright officials" always clamor that "upright officials" are welcomed by the people. Comrade Fang Shi also says that Hai Rui "was loved by the people." Their basis is nothing more than: "History has records." Little do they know that in order to consolidate their reactionary rule and paralyze the people, the feudal ruling class always spared no effort to publicize the "virtuous governance" of "upright officials." Those who compile historical materials always do so from the interests of their own class. Chairman Mao taught us that we should smell everything with our noses, distinguish its good from its bad, and then decide whether to welcome it or resist it. Therefore, when we quote historical materials, we must use the Marxist class viewpoint to analyze them, eliminate the false and retain the true, and discard the dross and select the essence. We must never parrot others or mechanically apply them. In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han pieced together some historical materials written by feudal literati, elaborated on them, and portrayed Hai Rui as a "savior of the people." Comrade Fang Shi also echoes here, affirming that the people "love" Hai Rui. We cannot help but ask, on what class position is Comrade Fang Shi standing when he looks at historical materials?
    Comrade Fang Shi does not study the class essence of "upright officials," but blindly praises the positive role of "upright officials," declaring that if there were only corrupt officials and peasant uprisings in history, then production could not have developed and history could not have progressed. The implication is that the development of Chinese feudal society was fortunate to have "upright officials," and "upright officials" actually became the driving force of historical development. This is also extremely absurd.
    Chairman Mao taught us, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."① "In Chinese feudal society, it was only this peasant class struggle, these peasant uprisings and peasant wars that constituted the real motive force of historical development."② He also taught us that in feudal society, "only the peasants and the handicraftsmen were the basic classes that created wealth and culture."③ These teachings of Chairman Mao are the most basic principles for us to study the development of Chinese feudal society. However, in Comrade Fang Shi's writing, "upright officials" have become the driving force for "production development" and "historical advancement"! How incompatible is this view with the Marxist viewpoint! Where is there any mention of studying from a proletarian standpoint?
    Some people, under the banner of "historicism," oppose using the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method to study history. When people expose the reactionary essence of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers and re-evaluate their historical role, they vehemently oppose it, saying that studying history in this way is "not true" and "unhistorical." Comrade Fang Shi is also like this. When people expose the class essence of Hai Rui and historical "upright officials," he domineeringly declares that "there is no need to study history."
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years."④ Our study of history is to study and summarize the experiences and lessons of thousands of years of class struggle, to stand on the proletarian stand, and to thoroughly clarify the history that has been confused by feudal historians and bourgeois historians from the viewpoint of class struggle. One of the important contents is to re-evaluate the emperors, kings, generals, and ministers who have always been praised in history, and to resolutely expose the "upright official" masks worn by some landlords and expose their true colors.
    "Upright officials" have deceived the people for many years, and now it is time to completely end the "upright official" scam! May I ask Comrade Fang Shi, can the study of this history of thousands of years of class struggle be done without analyzing it from the viewpoint of class struggle? Can we proletarians not re-evaluate the history that has been seriously distorted by the landlord class? If not, is it "necessary to study history" only by continuing to stand on the position of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, praising "upright officials," letting "upright officials" deceive the people, and even promoting class reconciliation like Comrade Wu Han? Whose history will such "history" be? We resolutely do not want such history! The "upright officials" created by the ruling class in history must be negated! The class essence of Hai Rui must be exposed! "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" must be criticized!
    Therefore, we believe that Comrade Fang Shi's efforts to win historical status for "upright officials" are actually efforts to win historical status for the feudal landlord class.

### 为“清官”争什么样的历史地位？

    为“清官”争什么样的历史地位？
    中国人民解放军某部　李庆
    提要：方史同志抹杀“清官”的本质，把“清官”当作历史发展的动力，这是完全荒谬的。他竭力为“清官”争历史地位，实际上是为封建地主阶级争历史地位。
    方史同志的《对（评新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》》一文质疑》（载
  《人民日报》今年二月三日）是一篇为《海瑞罢官》作辩护并为海瑞和历史上的“清官”争地位的文章。这里想着重就“清官”问题提一些意见，和方史同志商榷。
    方史同志一开头就提出：如果认为“清官”和贪官是“一号货色”，那就没有“什么必要研究历史”了。他引用了姚文元同志的这段话：‘从根本上说，不论‘清官’、‘好官’多么‘清’，多么‘好’，他们毕竟只能是地主阶级对农民实行专政的‘清官’、‘好官’，而不可能相反”。但是，方史同志恰恰忽略了“从根本上说”这五个重要的字。“根本”是什么？就是阶级本质。难道说，从阶级本质来看，“清官”和贪官不是“一号货色”吗？这是一条绝不能否定的阶级界限。
    有些人大叫大嚷，以“一分为二”为借口，大肆颂扬“清官”。据说，“清官”虽然是统治阶级的一员，但是他们是“站在人民的一边”的。方史同志实际上认为，海瑞就是这样的“清官”。这完全是没有阶级观点的梦呓。在封建社会，怎么可能有既对皇帝、地主阶级忠，又对人民“好”的“合二而一”的官老爷呢？方史同志一方面也承认“抹杀‘清官’的阶级本质……显然是严重的原则的错误”，一方面却又不愿意承认从根本上说，“清官”和贪官是“一号货色”，这是多么自相矛盾呵！
    一些吹捧“清官”的人，总是叫嚷“清官”是受人民欢迎的。方史同志也说，海瑞“受到人民热爱”。他们的根据，不外是：“史有记载”。殊不知封建统治阶级为了巩固其反动统治，麻痹人民，总是不惜笔墨地渲染“清官”的“德政”。编撰史料的人总是从本阶级的利益出发来编撰史料的。毛主席教导我们，对于任何东西都用鼻子嗅一嗅，鉴别其好坏，然后才决定欢迎它，或者抵制它。因此，我们引用史料必须运用马克思主义的阶级观点去分析，去伪存真，去芜存精，绝不可人云亦云，死搬硬套。在《海瑞罢官》里，吴晗同志拼凑了一些封建文人写的史料，加以发挥，把海瑞描绘成“人们的救星”。方史同志也在这里随声附和，肯定人民“热爱”海瑞。我们不禁要问，方史同志究竟是站在什么阶级的立场上来看待史料的？
    方史同志不去研究“清官”的阶级本质，一味吹捧“清官”的积极作用，宣称如果历史上只有贪官污吏，农民起义，那末生产就不能发展了，历史就不能发展了。言下之意，中国封建社会的发展幸亏有了“清官”，“清官”竟然成了历史发展的动力。这也是荒谬透顶的。
    毛主席教导我们，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”①“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”②还教导我们，在封建社会里“只有农民和手工业工人是创造财富和创造文化的基本的阶级”③。毛主席的这些教导，是我们研究中国封建社会发展的最基本的原理。但是在方史同志的笔下，“清官”却变成了“生产发展”“历史推进”的动力！这种观点与马克思主义的观点是多么格格不入！哪里还谈得上什么站在无产阶级立场研究呢？
    有些人打着“历史主义”的招牌，反对用无产阶级的立场、观点和方法去研究历史。人家揭露帝王将相的反动本质，重新评价他们的历史作用，他们就激烈反对，说是这样研究历史就“不真实”了，“非历史主义”了。方史同志也是这样，人家揭露海瑞和历史上“清官”的阶级本质，他就专横地宣布“没有什么必要研究历史了”。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”④我们研究历史就是要研究和总结几千年阶级斗争的经验教训，就是要站在无产阶级的立场上，用阶级斗争的观点，把被封建史家、资产阶级史家搞得混混沌沌的历史彻底澄清。其中重要的内容之一，就是对历史上一贯颂扬备至的帝王将相重行评价，就是要坚决揭穿套在一些地主头上的“清官”面纱，暴露其真相。
    “清官”骗人民已经骗了不少年，现在该是彻底结束“清官”骗局的时候了！请问方史同志，研究这几千年的阶级斗争史不用阶级斗争观点去分析能行吗？我们无产阶级不去把被地主阶级严重歪曲了的历史重新评价能行吗？如果不行，难道继续站在地主阶级资产阶级的立场上，颂扬“清官”，让“清官”来欺骗人民，甚至象吴晗同志那样宣扬阶级调和，才是有“必要研究历史”？这样的“历史”将是谁的历史呢？这样的历史，我们坚决不要！历史上统治阶级制造的“清官”一定要否定！海瑞的阶级本质一定要揭露！《海瑞罢官》一定要批判！
    因此，我们认为，方史同志竭力为“清官”争历史地位，实际上是为封建地主阶级争历史地位。
