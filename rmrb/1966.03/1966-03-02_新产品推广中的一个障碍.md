    Some new products, with good performance, high efficiency, and material savings, are priced too high, seriously affecting their promotion and use.
    New industrial products are increasingly emerging in our country. Their performance, quality, and other aspects are better than older products. In factory construction, we should try to promote the use of these new products as much as possible to improve the technical level of our country's industrial equipment.
    However, in our work, we have encountered a major contradiction: some new products have good performance, high efficiency, and can also save materials, but they are too expensive. When designing factories, we often cannot adopt these new products due to this reason and are forced to use older products with poorer performance but lower prices, which affects the innovation of design work and the improvement of the technical level of the factory. We are engaged in electrical design for mechanical factories, so let us give a few examples in this regard. For example, using high-efficiency new light sources for lighting in tall factory buildings is increasingly urgent, such as high-pressure mercury fluorescent lamps and tungsten iodide lamps. They have high luminous efficiency, which is beneficial for production and saves electricity. However, a set of 400-watt high-pressure mercury fluorescent lamps costs more than 120 yuan, a set of 40-watt fluorescent lamps costs more than 10 yuan, while a 500-watt incandescent light bulb only costs 3 yuan each, which is a huge difference.
    Furthermore, using solid-state silicon rectifiers as DC power supplies has great advantages over motor-generator sets, such as small size, simple maintenance, and reduction of operating personnel, etc. However, the prices of these two products are now vastly different. A certain model of silicon rectifier costs around 6,000 yuan, while a motor-generator set for the same purpose costs less than 3,000 yuan.
    Another example is the new dry-type transformer, which is smaller in size and has many advantages. However, the price of this new dry-type transformer is one to two times higher than that of an oil-immersed transformer of the same capacity.
    When designing factories, we often hesitate because of such problems. If we use new products and new technologies, we will have to spend a lot more money. In the end, we often have to consider the economy and choose old products. This situation is not conducive to the promotion of new technologies, and it is also uneconomical from the perspective of the entire country. We believe that all new industrial products should prioritize quality and be of the highest standard. However, if we do not pay attention to saving and the cost is too high and the price is too expensive, the best products still cannot play their due role, then what practical significance does this have? We hope this issue can attract the attention of production units and other relevant parties.

    新产品推广中的一个障碍
    有些新产品，性能好，效率高，也节约原材料，但价格过高，严重影响了它的推广使用
    现在我国新的工业产品越来越多，它们的性能、质量等各方面都比老产品好，在工厂建设中应当尽量推广使用这些新产品，提高我国工业装备的技术水平。
    但是，在工作中我们遇到了一个很大的矛盾，这就是：有一部分新产品，它们的性能好，效率高，也能节省材料，就是价格太贵。我们在设计工厂的时候，往往由于这个原因不能采用这些新产品，不得不被迫采用性能差但价钱低的老产品，以至影响到设计工作的革新和工厂技术水平的提高。我们是搞机械工厂的电气设计的，就举几个这方面的例子来说吧。例如在高大厂房内使用高效率新光源照明，现在愈来愈迫切需要高压水银荧光灯和碘钨灯等，它发光效率高，既有利于生产，又节省电力。但是一套四百瓦的高压水银荧光灯要一百二十多元，一套四十瓦日光灯要十元多，而五百瓦的白炽灯泡每个只要三元，相差多么大。
    又如，采用固体硅整流器作为直流电源，比电动发电机组有很大优点，如体积小，维护简单，能减少操作人员等等。但这两种产品现在价格相差悬殊，一台某种型号的硅整流器要六千元左右，而同样用途的电动发电机组每套还不到三千元。
    又如新型的干式变压器，它体积较小，优点很多。但这种新型的干式变压器的价格，却比同等容量的油浸式变压器贵一到两倍。
    我们在设计工厂的时候，经常因为遇到这样的问题而举棋不定，如果采用新产品新技术，就要多花许多钱，最后往往不得不从经济上考虑而选用老产品。这种状况，对于新技术的推广是不利的，从整个国家出发算大账，也是不合算的。我们认为，一切工业新产品应当好字当头，质量第一。但如果不注意省，成本太高，价格太贵，最好的产品仍然不能起它应有的作用，这还有什么实际意义呢？希望这个问题能够引起生产单位和其它有关方面的注意。
