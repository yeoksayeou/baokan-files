    Editor's Note: We recommend the outstanding daughter of the Vietnamese people, the revolutionary female hero of South Vietnam – Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau – to our readers with excitement and high respect.
    In "Living Like Him," the heroic and unyielding female hero who regarded death as homecoming – Sister X – is now Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau, the female hero who inspires millions of people to wage a determined struggle against US imperialism. In the enemy's prison, Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau spent more than one thousand three hundred days. During this long period, whether it was the enemy's inhumane torture or the enemy's sweet words of deception, the staunch proletarian revolutionary fighter Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau, like an incomparably hard giant rock, like a spotless piece of white jade, fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of preferring death to submission, and highly developed the firm and unwavering revolutionary integrity. Precisely because of this, Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau gloriously joined the Party in the enemy's prison, she truly "deserves the glorious title of a Party member."
    Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau's glorious deeds once again powerfully declare to the world: revolutionary people will never be intimidated or deceived. We firmly believe that Vietnam, with thousands upon thousands of heroes like Nguyen Van Troi and Nguyen Thi Chau, will surely be able to defeat US imperialism.
    Comrades who have read "Living Like Him" must still remember Sister X in the book, right? Her heroic image of being courageous and unyielding, regarding death as homecoming in the face of the enemy, is inspiring millions of revolutionary people to carry out successive battles against US imperialism and its running dogs! That beloved Sister X is the female hero Nguyen Thi Chau we are about to introduce below. At that time, in order not to expose her situation in the enemy's prison, a code name was used. Now the Vietnamese people, with victorious pride, have announced the glorious name of Nguyen Thi Chau.

    One

    In the dense forests of South Vietnam, we met the female hero who would rather die than bow her head – Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau. On that day, we were also joined by Phan Thi Quyen, the wife of Martyr Nguyen Van Troi. According to South Vietnamese customs, comrades call Phan Thi Quyen "Sister Quyen," and Nguyen Thi Chau "Sister Chau."
    Sister Chau is slightly older than Sister Quyen, born in 1938. The long prison life has damaged her health. Her complexion is still somewhat pale, and her eyesight is worse than before, but she is still radiant. Her long black hair is draped over her shoulders. Sister Chau said that her hair used to be longer. When the enemy tortured her, they tied her tightly to a bench with her long hair. In order to resist the enemy's torture, she cut it off at the roots and now it's growing back.
    Sister Chau met many sisters in prison, and Sister Quyen was one of them. Although they didn't have the same parents, they were as close as blood relatives. Sister Quyen told us: "Sister Chau helped me so much. As soon as I was arrested and taken to the General Police Department prison, a female fellow inmate in the neighboring cell asked me loudly what my name was and why I had been arrested. I told her truthfully. She asked, 'Is your husband the one who wanted to blow up McNamara?' I couldn't see her through the wall. I could tell that her tone was so affectionate. She asked my age and said, 'Now we are sisters, I am your older sister.' That was Sister Chau."
    In prison, whenever there was a chance to be together, Sister Chau would tell Sister Quyen about how the American bandits brought profound disasters to South Vietnam, tell the stories of the heroic struggles of revolutionary martyrs, and read revolutionary poems aloud. Sister Chau often told Sister Quyen about Nguyen Van Troi, which made Sister Quyen understand that as Nguyen Van Troi's wife, she should bear a sacred responsibility, that is, to jointly withstand all tests with this staunch revolutionary fighter.
    Sister Quyen said: "That day, the secret agents let me see Brother Troi. When I saw Brother Troi covered in bruises and scars, emaciated, I really wanted to cry. Suddenly I remembered what Sister Chau had said to me: 'You and Brother Troi have only been married for nineteen days. The enemy is trying to use the feelings of the wife to make your husband submit. You must be careful!' Remembering Sister Chau's words, I bit my lip and didn't cry after all. The enemy forged a confession and wanted Brother Troi to sign it. Brother Troi waved his pen and crossed out the confession, leaving only horizontal and vertical lines on the paper. I nodded to Brother Troi and said, 'You did the right thing, Brother Troi. I will always be with you. Even if I go to prison until I die, I will never surrender to the enemy!' Sister Chau suffered for this. The enemy said she taught me, and beat her half to death."
    Sister Chau smiled modestly and said: "Sister Quyen made rapid progress, mainly because she was from a working-class background, educated by the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people, influenced by Brother Troi, and helped by comrades in prison. Sister Quyen quickly cheered up after being imprisoned. The enemy let her boil water and do hard labor, which was convenient for her to go in and out. The prison Party branch wanted her to find out the situation of new inmates in various cells and be responsible for contacting outside organizations. When Sister Quyen was released from prison, we gave her another task, asking her to establish a mass organization in the cotton mill where she worked. Sister Quyen is very capable. Not long after she returned to the factory, she connected the sisters in the packaging workshop to carry out a struggle."
    Sister Quyen busily said: "Compared with Sister Chau, I have done too little for the revolution. But whenever I complete a task, no matter how big or small, I am always happy. I feel that now I am standing with Brother Troi, standing with Sister Chau."

    Two

    Enemy planes dropped bombs somewhere nearby again. We listened quietly to Sister Chau telling about her one thousand three hundred and ten days of prison life amid the booming explosions.
    Sister Chau was imprisoned on February 9, 1961. At that time, she was studying in high school and had just joined the Youth League. She was arrested because of a reactionary relative's denunciation. Sister Chau was sent to the "Central Special Task Force." This special agent organization was managed by Ngo Dinh Diem's younger brother, Ngo Dinh Can, specializing in so-called "Recall Policy" to deceive and soften the youth. Duong Van Hieu, the head of the "Special Task Force," personally conducted the first "Recall Talk" with Sister Chau. He smiled wickedly and said, "Don't be restrained, just like a younger sister in front of an older brother."
    Sister Chau felt nauseous and said, "I am very fortunate not to have an older brother like you."
    Duong Van Hieu shook his head and said, "Don't hate us so much. We are just trying to save the country and drive out those who infringe on the country's independence. In your own family, if you see a thief coming in, wouldn't you pick up a stick and drive him away?"
    Sister Chau said angrily: "Drive them away, yes, but the thieves I see are shouting that others are thieves all day long."
    The enemy arranged for some reactionary students to use all kinds of sweet words to "enlighten" Sister Chau in turn. They babbled about how happy and promising the students in the South were. Sister Chau disdained to pay attention, thinking that this group of running dogs was too stupid and too ridiculous. Sister Chau knew the situation of the students in the South best. In the South, how many young people have been harmed by the US-Ngo clique, lost their families and died, not to mention studying, they can't even eat. But the children of the rich can spend 20,000 yuan to buy a graduation diploma. It is difficult for poor students like Sister Chau to get a diploma, and even if they get one, they can't find a job without connections. The "enlightenment" was ineffective, and the enemy changed its tricks to lure Sister Chau: "Since it was a relative who denounced you, it is also possible that they caught some evidence. You might as well admit one or two minor things and strive to get out of prison as soon as possible." This aroused Sister Chau's high vigilance. She thought: Even if it is a minor thing, as long as I admit it in front of the enemy, isn't it also compromising my integrity? Isn't it also changing color? How is this different from those shameful traitors!

    Three

    The enemy knew that it was impossible to "recall" Sister Chau, so they transferred her to "P42." "P42" was a real hell on earth. No one knew how many white bones of revolutionary soldiers were piled up in that gloomy dungeon and dark ditch.
    Sister Chau was blindfolded and sent to "P42." She couldn't see anything, but she heard people being tortured everywhere. The enemy deliberately left a night for Sister Chau to think about it.
    That night, many thoughts flooded Sister Chau's mind. She thought of the Party, of her comrades, and naturally also of her fiancé, Comrade Le Hong Tu. Le Hong Tu was not only the person Sister Chau loved, but also the guide who led her to participate in the revolution. At first, Sister Chau participated in the student movement only to be able to study and find a job smoothly. Under the inspiration and help of Comrade Le Hong Tu, Sister Chau jumped out of the narrow personal circle. She understood that if the American bandits are not driven away, if the puppet regime of US imperialism is not overthrown, if the society where people eat people is not fundamentally overthrown, the South of the motherland will never be saved. Sister Chau remembered that Le Hong Tu was holding a banner and walking at the front of the student demonstration team, and Sister Chau was following him closely. Armed police rushed over and beat Le Hong Tu until his head was bleeding, but he still shouted the slogan "Down with the US-Ngo clique" and greeted everyone to maintain the formation and continue to move forward. Sister Chau also remembered that the last time they parted, Le Hong Tu had instructed her: "No matter what happens, you must always follow the revolution!" Sister Chau thought, now is the time to test myself.
    A special agent pushed Sister Chau to see Major A.Qing. This guy asked Sister Chau about the Youth League's activities and asked about her organizational relationships. Sister Chau gave him a concise answer: "I don't know!" Special Agent A.Qing roared, and four or five minions rushed up, pushed Sister Chau into the torture chamber, tied her to a bench, pried open her mouth with an iron ruler and poured soapy water in, swelling her stomach and then pressing hard to force the soapy water out. Then they used electric shock. ... The gangsters continuously tortured Sister Chau in this way. First she walked into the torture chamber herself, then two people carried her in, and then she was carried in on a stretcher, until she lost consciousness and was thrown back into the cell. This torment lasted for more than a month, without getting any results.
    The special agent major was helpless. After a few days, he suddenly put on a smiling face and said to Sister Chau: "The last time we met was not pleasant. It shouldn't happen again this time, right?" He handed over a bottle of penicillin and said: "Your face is full of sores. Taking this medicine will make them better. This medicine is very expensive and difficult to buy. I treat you differently. It won't be like this for others."
    Sister Chau said: "There is no need to play this trick! Take out whatever else you have!"
    "We don't have to quarrel. As long as you are willing to repent and rehabilitate, you can be released immediately. We can also help you financially and send you to study abroad. You can choose to go to the United States or the United Kingdom. I am very willing to train talented people like you."
    "Sorry, I have never accepted anyone's favor in my life, let alone the favor of someone like you."
    Sister Chau saw through that these American running dogs, learned from their masters, had nothing more than two tricks: one hard and one soft. First they "recall" you, if they can't recall you, they torture you. If they can't get anything out of you, they "recall" you again. Anyway, they want you to kneel down and surrender.

    Four

    Sister Chau was pushed into the torture chamber again. This time, in addition to hanging and pouring soapy water, they also stuck large needles into the center of Sister Chau's fingernails, filling all ten fingers. They tortured Sister Chau all night, and Sister Chau cursed them all night. Sister Chau returned to the cell, unconscious for a while and awake for a while. She felt that she might stop breathing at any time. She thought, I can't die like this without understanding. Anger burned in Sister Chau's heart, and she recited a few lines of poetry. She moved her body with difficulty, approached the wall, took off her hair clip, and used all her strength to carve her poetry deeply on the cell wall:
        I will stand tall like a giant rock by the sea,
        No matter how bad the wind and waves are, I will never lower my head.
        Bloodstains soaked my white clothes,
        But the heart under the clothes is forever pure and white.

    Sister Chau fainted on the ground after carving the poetry.
    Soon, the enemy transferred Sister Chau to Gia Dinh Prison.
    In Gia Dinh Prison, Sister Chau spent the most unforgettable moment of her life. She was accepted into the Party in the cell. She had heard before that there was a Sister N, who was in charge of the Party's work with urban intellectuals. She didn't expect to meet Sister N in Gia Dinh Prison, and Sister N became her introducer to the Party.
    One day, Sister N asked Sister Chau: "Do you want to join the Party?"
    Sister Chau was very excited, and it took a long time before she could speak: "I'm afraid I'm not good enough. I hope to wait for a while and let the Party see me again."
    "The organization has reviewed your resume. The organization also knows your performance in prison. I believe you are fully worthy of the glorious title of a Party member."
    Sister Chau grabbed Sister N's hand, and tears streamed down her face. This was the first time she had cried since she was imprisoned. These were tears of happiness.
    At midnight on September 2, 1961, which was also the night of the National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a Party membership ceremony was held for Sister Chau. Everyone in the collective cell was asleep, and a small oil lamp was lit in the corner of the room. A sickle and axe were pasted on the wall, which Sister N had just cut from a small notebook. Sister N announced the decision to admit new Party members. Sister Chau raised her hand and swore an oath facing the sickle and axe. The oath was two sentences that she had already thought about: Be loyal to the Party for life and resolutely struggle for the Party until the last breath. How much Sister Chau wanted to proclaim her oath loudly to the Party and to the brothers and sisters all over the world who are fighting for justice! But at this moment, she could only restrain her emotions and keep her voice very low. The cell was quiet, the wick of the lamp was fluttering, and Sister Chau's heart was also fluttering. When the enemy severely tortured her and forced her to admit that she was a Party member, Sister Chau was very regretful because she was not yet. Unexpectedly, in the sound of shackles, under the enemy's barbaric destruction, she gloriously entered the ranks of the Party. Sister Chau felt that the blood all over her body was surging like a tide. She urged herself not to let down the glorious title of a Party member, and not to let down this solemn moment!
    Sister N assigned Sister Chau to be responsible for the work of the Youth League in Gia Dinh Prison. Sister Chau was very active. The enemy noticed and transferred her to the "Special Task Force." According to the Party's instructions, Sister Chau established the Party's grassroots organization there, with her as the branch secretary. The work progressed rapidly. Every cell had a group, and they could collectively study politics and culture, and criticize and help each other. Party members and Youth League members carried out propaganda and education for general criminals through individual friendships, artistic performances and other secret ways. Sister Chau and her comrades also successfully led several hunger strikes, demanding to improve living conditions. The enemy said that wherever Sister Chau went, there would be no peace.
    Once, a secret letter was discovered by a special agent. Sister Chau was very calm. She cleverly destroyed the documents so that the enemy could not find any handle. The special agents pushed Sister Chau into the torture chamber, inserted two wires into her ears, connected the other two to her toes, and started the generator, shaking and stopping, stopping and shaking. Sister Chau convulsed all over, feeling sparks all over the sky. The gangsters also dripped soapy water into her nostrils. When the soapy water went in, blood flowed out. She fainted, and used a stick to gently tap her from foot to head. When she regained consciousness, they started the generator again. ... The next day, Sister Chau suffered from menorrhagia. The enemy still tortured her as usual. Sister Chau cursed them as worse than beasts. The enemy tied Sister Chau's hands and feet together, and a dozen people surrounded her and kicked and beat her indiscriminately. Sister Chau's fingernails were beaten off, and her gums were kicked to pieces, but she bit her shoulder hard, determined not to make a sound in front of the enemy, and determined not to show the slightest weakness in front of the enemy.
    Speaking of this, Sister Chau became particularly excited. She said: "At that time, I had difficulty breathing. I vaguely felt that President Ho was standing in front of me. Uncle Ho said to me: 'Child, be brave! Hold your head up!' Thinking of this, I immediately felt very powerful. A special agent came to ask for a confession again, and I slapped him twice hard. ... I fainted again. The next day I woke up and saw that my whole body was wrapped in bandages, leaving only my eyes. But I didn't feel any pain. I remembered what the revolutionary predecessor Brother Dong said: 'Ideals can eliminate all pain.' When a person puts ideals in his heart, physical pain is nothing!"

    Five

    The enemy had transferred Sister Chau to Republican Prison, Phu Loi Prison, Chi Hoa Prison, and Thu Duc Prison one after another. ... She had lived in almost all the women's prisons in Saigon, some of them several times in and out, and finally she was transferred back to the General Police Department Prison.
    Wherever she was transferred, Sister Chau did everything possible to work and fight for the Party. As soon as she arrived, the flames of struggle were quickly ignited in the prison. So the heads of the prisons seemed to be scalded when they saw Sister Chau being escorted in, saying: "Oh my! How did she come again!" The enemy couldn't wait to end Sister Chau's life immediately, but things were not that simple. At that time, the People's Armed Forces of South Vietnam had won successive battles, and the urban mass movement was surging higher and higher. In this climate, killing a revolutionary youth would immediately arouse widespread anger among the people. The people can't be killed. Killing one Nguyen Thi Chau will lead to thousands of Nguyen Thi Chau standing up. In addition, when Ngo Dinh Diem fell, the puppet regime was crumbling. The reactionary politicians were trying to seize power and profit, and they were trying to use various opportunities to gain political capital and attack each other. Therefore, the puppet authorities had to carefully consider killing Nguyen Thi Chau. Since it was inconvenient to kill her, it would be better to let her go. One is to avoid her leading the prisoners in more intense struggles in prison; the other is to release her, and use this to show the people "democracy." However, it could not be released so casually. It would be best to get a letter of repentance from the prisoner, or at least let Sister Chau make a slight gesture of bowing her head in public before pushing her out, so that the surface would look good.
    One day, the special agent major of the police department prison said to Sister Chau in desperation: "Madam! I am almost kneeling down to beg you. We don't want you to repent, and we don't want you to rehabilitate. We just ask you to salute the national flag, that is, to bow your head a little, can you?"
    Sister Chau said firmly: "I will not bow my head. I only have hatred for a slave regime. I will never salute this dirty flag."
    "Do you really not want to be forgiven by the government?"
    "I am innocent and do not want anyone to forgive me."
    "What do you want?"
    "I hope to bask in the sun in the courtyard."
    "That's easy to say, I'll solve it for you right away. But you might as well show us a little friendliness. For example, when others salute the national flag, you also stand up with them. I don't want you to bow and salute, just stand aside, that's always okay, right?"
    "Even if a gun is pointed at me, I won't stand up."
    "Then pretend you are sick and can't stand up. Just tell me, you are willing to show respect to the national flag."
    Sister Chau turned her head and didn't bother to pay attention to him.
    The special agent roared: "You people, why are you so stupid and rigid in revolution? What does it matter to say a few kind words? If you say it, you will be released, and you can do whatever you want when you go out."
    The fellow inmates in the prison heard it and burst into laughter. The special agent major, like an evil dog hit by a stick, tucked its tail and slipped away.
    The special agent major thought he was very clever, and thought that Sister Chau would fall into his trap. Unexpectedly, Sister Chau was so firm and so alert, not leaving the slightest gap for the enemy to take advantage of. We are proud of Sister Chau's "stupidity" and "rigidity." This quiet and thin girl used her iron will to defend the lofty revolutionary integrity of a proletarian fighter. Just as she said in her poetry, she is a giant rock by the sea, standing proudly and not taking a step back under the impact of the storm!

    Six

    The enemy failed shamefully in both hard and soft tactics. Sister Chau carried out a heroic struggle with the enemy for more than one thousand three hundred days, walked out of the prison, and returned to her home. The whole family was both surprised and sad. The grandmother cried, hugging her granddaughter when she saw her tortured beyond recognition. The mother knew that she couldn't stay at home, and said to Sister Chau: "Your body is too weak now. Stay at home and take care of yourself for a few days. When you get better, you can go wherever you want. I won't stop you." Sister Chau wanted to stay with her relatives so much, but she always felt empty in her heart. She couldn't wait to find the Party and accept the combat tasks assigned to her by the Party. Sister Chau only stayed at home for two days, then went to the organization to connect her relationship, and then came to the liberated area.
    Five months after Sister Chau was imprisoned, her fiancé, Comrade Le Hong Tu, was also arrested. He and Le Quang Vinh and more than a dozen other young people wanted to use grenades to blow up the American "ambassador" Nolting, but were unfortunately arrested. The eighth letter in the first collection of "Letters from the South" describes this event that frightened the enemy. Le Hong Tu was exiled to Con Son Island, and was escorted back to Saigon in October last year. The enemy announced that he would be executed.
    We asked Sister Chau if she had met Comrade Le Hong Tu in prison. Sister Chau said: "I haven't met him. He once asked someone to say hello to me and brought me a gift, which was a heart made of coins, one side carved with a sickle and axe, and the other side carved with TC, which is the abbreviation of our two names. Unfortunately, this gift was searched away by the enemy."
    Sister Chau took out a photo of Comrade Le Hong Tu for us to see. He was a heroic young man, with bright eyes staring ahead. Under the photo was a line of words, which was what he replied to the enemy when he was sentenced to death in the special military court: "It's a pity that I don't have enough grenades to kill all the American bandits!" We looked at the strong young face for a long time, and felt that these words were not printed on the photo, but were shouted to the world in his firm and loud voice.
    After a while, Sister Chau said: "He was very gentle to his comrades. I remember that some progressive students went on a picnic together, and the weather was cold. He always gave his blanket to others. Some students threw a tantrum at him, and asked him afterwards: 'Are you angry with me?' He said: 'My heart is filled with friendship for you, there is no room for anger.' He is such a person!"
    Sister Chau used very few words to introduce her fiancé Le Hong Tu to us. Comrade Le Hong Tu hated the enemy, hated them deeply, and loved his comrades, loved them deeply. It is such a young man with a pure and kind heart, such a student who has not yet graduated from high school, whom the US-puppet clique is planning to kill at any time. People are watching closely with burning eyes of anger, and will never allow the killing of Le Hong Tu – the excellent son of the Vietnamese people!
    We are about to shake hands and say goodbye to Sister Chau and Sister Quyen. They accepted the invitation to visit Nguyen Van Troi Primary School. They walked along the path in the forest, and after a few steps, they disappeared into the dense bushes. The hearty laughter was still echoing in the forest. We looked in the direction where Sister Chau and Sister Quyen were going, and talked about our feelings. We know that in the South, people like Comrade Nguyen Thi Chau are countless, it can be said that they are very ordinary. Precisely because they are ordinary, they are even more remarkable. Doesn't the heroic spirit of Nguyen Thi Chau, who would rather die than bow her head in the face of the enemy, also embody the steadfast and unyielding heroic character of the Vietnamese nation!

    She moved her body with difficulty, approached the wall, took off her hair clip, and used all her strength to carve her poetry on the cell wall.
    Sister Chau said firmly: "I will not bow my head. I only have hatred for a slave regime. I will never salute this dirty flag."

    坚贞不屈的女英雄——阮氏珠
    徐怀中　丛深　马真划　李珉
    编者按：我们怀着激动的心情和崇高的敬意，向读者们推荐越南人民的优秀女儿、越南南方的革命女英雄——阮氏珠同志。
    在《象他那样生活》里，那位英勇不屈、视死如归的女英雄——X姐，就是现在这位鼓舞千百万人民向美帝国主义进行坚决斗争的女英雄阮氏珠同志。在敌人的监狱里，阮氏珠同志整整度过了一千三百多天。在这个漫长的时日里，无论是敌人的惨无人道的刑讯，无论是敌人的花言巧语的诱骗，坚强的无产阶级革命战士阮氏珠同志，就象一座坚硬无比的巨岩，就象一块一尘不染的白玉，充分显示出宁死不屈的英雄气概，高度发扬了坚定不移的革命气节。正因为如此，就在敌人的监狱里，阮氏珠同志光荣地加入了党的队伍，她真正“配得上一个党员的光荣称号”。
    阮氏珠同志的光辉事迹，再一次有力地向全世界宣告：革命的人民，永远是吓不倒、骗不了的。我们深信，有着千千万万个阮文追式、阮氏珠式的英雄的越南，是一定能够打败美帝国主义的。
    读过《象他那样生活》一书的同志们，一定还记得书中的那位X姐吧？她在敌人面前那威武不屈、视死如归的英雄形象，正鼓舞着千百万革命人民，向美帝国主义及其走狗进行前仆后继的战斗！那位令人敬爱的X姐，就是我们下面要介绍的女英雄阮氏珠。当时为了不暴露她在敌人监狱里的情况，用了代号。现在越南人民带着胜利的自豪，宣布了阮氏珠这个光辉的名字。
    一
    在越南南方茂密的森林里，我们会见了宁死不低头的女英雄——阮氏珠同志。那天，同我们一起会见的，还有阮文追烈士的妻子潘氏娟。按照越南南方风俗，同志们管潘氏娟叫娟姐，管阮氏珠叫珠姐。
    珠姐比娟姐稍大些，一九三八年生。长久的监狱生活毁坏了她的健康，至今脸色还有些苍白，视力也比从前差了，但依然神采焕发。黑黑的长发散披在肩后。珠姐说，她的头发原先还要长些，敌人行刑的时候，用她的长发把她死死捆在板凳上，她为反抗敌人的折磨，把它齐根儿剪了，如今是新蓄起来的。
    珠姐在监狱里结识了许多姐妹，娟姐就是一个。她俩虽不同父母，却是骨血相亲。娟姐对我们说：“珠姐对我的帮助太大了。我刚被抓进警察总署监狱，隔壁牢房就有位女难友，大声问我叫什么名字，为什么抓进来。我照实说了，她问：‘你丈夫就是要炸死麦克纳马拉的人吗？’隔着墙壁，我看不见她。听得出，她的口吻是那么亲。她问了我的年纪，说：‘现在我们是姐妹了，我是你的姐姐。’她就是珠姐。”
    在监狱里，只要有机会到一起，珠姐就对娟姐讲美国强盗怎样把深重的灾难带到越南南方，讲革命烈士英勇斗争的故事，朗读革命诗歌。珠姐常常对娟姐讲起阮文追，使娟姐懂得了，作为阮文追的妻子，应当承担起一种神圣的责任，那就是和这位坚强的革命战士共同经受一切考验。
    娟姐说：“那天，特务们让我去看追哥。一见追哥满身淤血伤痕，瘦骨嶙嶙的，我真想大哭。忽然想起珠姐曾对我说过：‘你和追哥刚结婚十九天，敌人正想利用做妻子的感情，使你的丈夫屈服，你可要当心啊！’想起珠姐的话，我咬住嘴唇，到底没哭出来。敌人伪造了一张供词，要追哥在上面签字。追哥挥起笔，画掉了供词，那纸上只剩下了横七竖八的大杠杠。我对追哥点头说：‘你做得对，追哥，我要永远和你在一起，就是坐牢坐到死，也决不向敌人屈服！’珠姐为这件事吃了苦，敌人说是她教我的，打得她死去活来。”
    珠姐谦逊地笑笑说：“娟姐进步快，主要因为她是工人出身，受到越南人民革命斗争的教育，有追哥的影响，加上狱里同志们帮助。娟姐入狱以后很快就振作起来了。敌人让她去烧水做苦工，出出进进方便，监狱党支部就要她了解各牢房新难友的情况，负责和外面组织联络。娟姐出狱的时候，我们又交给她一个任务，让她在她做工的药棉厂里建立群众组织。娟姐很能干，她回厂不久，就串连包装车间姐妹们进行了一次斗争。”
    娟姐忙说：“比起珠姐，我为革命做的太少了。不过大小完成一点任务，我心里总是喜欢不尽的。我觉得如今我和追哥站在一道了，和珠姐站在一道了。”
    二
    敌机又往附近什么地方扔炸弹，我们在轰轰隆隆的爆炸声中静听着珠姐讲述她一千三百一十天的监狱生活。
    珠姐是一九六一年二月九日入狱的。当时她正读高中，刚加入青年团不久，因为一个反动亲戚告密被捕。珠姐被送到“中部特别工作团”。这个特务组织，由吴庭艳的弟弟吴庭谨主管，专搞什么“召回政策”来欺骗软化青年。“特别工作团”团长杨文孝，亲自和珠姐进行了首次“召回谈话”。他堆着一脸奸笑说：“你不要拘束，就象一个妹妹在大哥哥面前一样。”
    珠姐一阵恶心，说：“我很庆幸，没有你这样的一位哥哥。”
    杨文孝摇晃着脑袋说：“不必这么仇恨我们，我们不过是为了拯救国家，要把侵犯国家独立的人赶出去。你在自己家庭里，看见有贼进来，是不是要拿起棍子来赶呢？”
    珠姐气愤地说：“赶是要赶的，不过我看见的那些贼，他们整天都在叫嚷别人是贼。”
    敌人安排一些反动学生，用尽甜言蜜语，轮番来“启示”珠姐。他们胡说什么南方学生如何幸福，有前途。珠姐不屑于理睬，觉得这群走狗太愚蠢，太可笑了。南方学生的情况，珠姐是最清楚不过的。在南方，有多少青少年，被美吴集团害得家破人亡，别说念书，饭都吃不上。而有钱人子弟却可以花两万元买一张毕业文凭。象珠姐这样的穷苦学生，很难拿到文凭，就是拿到，没有门子也别想找职业。“启示”无效，敌人又换了花招来诱骗珠姐：“既然是亲戚告密，也可能他们抓到了些凭据。你不如拣着轻的小的，承认一两桩，争取早出狱要紧。”这话引起了珠姐高度的警惕。她想：就算轻的小的，只要在敌人面前承认，不也是屈节吗，不也是变色吗，这和那些可耻的叛徒有什么两样！
    三
    敌人知道，想要“召回”珠姐不可能，把她转到“P42”去了。“P42”是一座真正的人间地狱。在那阴森森的地牢和暗沟里不知堆了多少革命志士的白骨。
    珠姐被蒙着眼睛送进“P42”，什么也看不见，只听到处在拷打人。敌人故意留出一个晚上时间，让珠姐想想。
    这一夜，多少思念涌上珠姐的心头，她想到了党，想到了同志们，自然也想到了她的未婚夫黎鸿司同志。黎鸿司不只是珠姐钟爱的人，也是她参加革命的引路人。最初珠姐参加学生运动，还只是为了能够顺利求学和找职业。在黎鸿司同志启发帮助下，珠姐跳出了狭小的个人圈子，她懂得了，不赶走美国强盗，不打倒美帝国主义的走狗政权，不从根本上推翻人吃人的社会，祖国南方永远不能得救。珠姐记起，黎鸿司举着标语走在学生示威队伍的前头，珠姐紧跟着他。武装警察冲过来，把黎鸿司打得头破血流，他还是高喊“打倒美吴集团”的口号，招呼大家保持队形继续前进。珠姐又记起，最后一次分手的时候，黎鸿司曾嘱咐她说：“无论到什么地步，你要永远跟着革命走！”珠姐想，现在是考验自己的时刻了。
    特务推着珠姐来见少校阿庆。这家伙问珠姐青年团的活动，问组织关系，珠姐给了他一个简明的答复：“不知道！”特务阿庆恶吼一声，四五个喽罗拥上来，把珠姐推进行刑室，绑在板凳上，用铁尺撬开嘴灌肥皂水，灌胀了肚子再用力压，使肥皂水喷出来。随后又上电刑。……强盗们这样连续摧残珠姐，先是她自己走进行刑室，后来是两个人架她进去，再后来是用担架抬进去。直到人事不省，丢回牢房。这样折磨了一个多月，没问出任何结果。
    特务少校无可奈何，过了几天，忽然换上了一副笑脸，对珠姐说：“上次我们见面不大愉快，这次该不会重演了吧。”他递过来一瓶盘尼西林，说：“你脸上长满了疮，吃下这药就会好的。这药很贵，很难买。我对你是另眼看待，换上别人可就不是这样了。”
    珠姐说：“用不着来这一套！还有什么本事你们就拿出来吧！”
    “我们不必斗嘴。只要你愿意悔过自新，马上就可以释放你。我们还可以从经济上帮助你，送你出国留学，到美国到英国由你选。我很愿意造就你这样的人材。”
      “对不起，我长这么大，还从没有接受过别人的恩惠，更不消说是接受你这种人的恩惠了。”
    珠姐看透了，这些美国走狗，从他们主子那里学来的，无非是软硬两手。先是“召回”你，召不回就拷打，打不出名堂，再来“召回”，横竖是要你屈膝投降。
    珠姐又被推进行刑室。这次除了吊打、灌肥皂水，又把大头针插进珠姐手指甲心，十个手指插满了。他们整晚上折磨珠姐，珠姐整晚上破口大骂。珠姐回到牢房，昏迷一阵清醒一阵，她觉得自己随时可能停止呼吸。心想，我不能这样不明不白地死去。珠姐心中燃烧着怒火，吟出几行诗句，她艰难地移动身体，靠近墙壁，取下头发夹子，用尽全身力量，把她的诗句深深地刻在牢房墙壁上：
        我要昂首挺立象海边的巨岩，
        任凭风恶浪险决不低下头来。
        遍体血污浸透了我洁白的衣衫，
        衣襟下的心灵却永远纯净洁白。
    四
    珠姐刻完诗句，昏倒在地上。
    不久，敌人把珠姐转到了嘉定监狱。
    在嘉定监狱，珠姐度过了她一生中最难忘的时刻，她在牢房里被接受入党了。以前她听说过有位N姐，是党内负责城市知识分子工作的，她没想到，会在嘉定监狱里和N姐认识，而且N姐作了她入党的介绍人。
    一天，N姐问珠姐：“你希望入党吗？”
    珠姐心情非常激动，过了好大一会儿才说出话来：“我怕自己还不够，我希望过一段，让党再看看我。”
      “组织上审查了你的履历。你在狱中的表现，组织上也都清楚。相信你完全配得上一个党员的光荣称号。”
    珠姐抓住N姐的手，止不住两行热泪滚下来，这是她入狱后第一次流泪，这是幸福的眼泪。
    一九六一年九月二日午夜时分，也正是越南民主共和国国庆之夜，为珠姐举行了入党仪式。集体牢房里人们都睡了，屋角里亮着一盏小油灯。墙上贴着镰刀斧头，是N姐刚刚从小本子上剪下来的。N姐宣布了吸收新党员的决定。珠姐面对镰刀斧头举手宣誓。誓词是她已经想好了的两句话：一生忠于党，坚决为党斗争到最后一口气。珠姐多么想向党、向全世界正在为正义而战斗的兄弟姐妹们，高声宣读自己的誓言啊！但此刻她只能克制住自己的感情，把声音压得很低很低，牢房里静静的，灯芯儿扑扑跳动着，珠姐的心也扑扑跳动着。先前敌人严刑拷打，逼她承认是党员的时候，珠姐很遗憾，因为自己还不是。没想到就在镣铐声中，在敌人野蛮的摧残下，她光荣地走进了党的行列。珠姐觉得周身血液象潮水一样涌上来，她叮嘱自己，决不能辜负党员这个光荣的称号，决不能辜负这个庄严的时刻！
    N姐分配珠姐负责嘉定监狱里的团的工作。珠姐搞得很活跃，敌人察觉，把她转送到“特别工作团”去。珠姐按照党的指示，又在那里建立了党的基层组织，由她担任支部书记。工作进展很快，每间牢房都有了小组，能够集体学习政治和文化，互相批评帮助。党团员同志通过个别交朋友、文艺表演和其它秘密方式，对一般刑事犯展开了宣传教育。珠姐和同志们还成功地领导了几次绝食斗争，要求改善生活条件。敌人说，珠姐到哪个监狱，就闹得哪里不得安宁。
    一次秘密传递信件，被特务发现了。珠姐很镇定，她巧妙地毁掉文件，使敌人抓不到把柄。特务们把珠姐推进行刑室，用两条电线插进她耳朵里，另外两条接在脚指上，摇起了发电机，摇摇停停，停停又摇，珠姐浑身抽搐，只觉得满天火星。强盗们还把肥皂水滴进鼻孔，肥皂水进去，鲜血流出来。昏死过去了，用棍子从脚到头轻轻敲打，待恢复了知觉，又摇起发电机。……第二天，珠姐患了血崩症，敌人照常行刑，珠姐大骂他们野兽不如。敌人把珠姐手脚捆绑一起，十几个人围成一圈乱踢乱打，珠姐指甲被打掉了，牙床被踢烂了，但她狠狠咬住自己肩膀，决不在敌人面前发出叫声，决不在敌人面前露出一丝一毫的软弱。
    珠姐讲到这儿，格外激昂起来，她说：“当时我呼吸已经很困难。我模模糊糊感觉到，胡主席就站在我面前，胡伯伯对我说：‘孩子，勇敢点！抬起头来！’想到这，我立刻觉得自己很有力量。一个特务又来问口供，我狠狠给了他两个耳光。……我又昏过去了。第二天我苏醒过来，见全身缠着绷带，只剩了两只眼睛。可是我并没有觉得痛苦，我记起革命前辈东哥说过：‘理想可以消除一切痛苦’。一个人，把理想搁在心上，肉体的痛苦就算不得什么了！”
    五
    敌人曾先后把珠姐转到共和监狱，富利监狱，志和监狱，守德监狱。……西贡的女牢她几乎住遍了，有的是几进几出，最后又转回到警察总署监狱。
    随便转到哪里，珠姐都是尽一切可能为党工作，为党战斗。她一来，狱里很快就燃起斗争烈火。所以各监狱的头子一见押送珠姐来，就象是烫着了，说：“哎呀！她怎么又来了！”敌人恨不得马上就结束珠姐的生命，但事情不那么简单。当时越南南方人民武装力量连连打胜仗，城市群众运动一浪高过一浪。在这样的气候下，杀害一个革命青年，立刻会激起人民广泛的愤怒。人民是杀不绝的，杀一个阮氏珠，会有千万个阮氏珠站起来。又加上当时吴庭艳倒台，傀儡政权摇摇欲坠，反动的政客们为了争权夺利，正想利用各种各样的机会捞政治资本，攻击对方。因此要杀阮氏珠，傀儡当局就不得不做慎重考虑。既不便杀害，还不如放掉，一则免得她在狱里带动犯人们进行更激烈的斗争；二则放她出去，还可以借此向人们显示一下“民主”。然而要放也不能那么随便，最好能拿到犯人一份悔过书，至少也要让珠姐在公开场合下，稍稍做一点低头的表示，再推她出去，面子上才好看。
    一天，警署监狱的特务少校气急败坏地对珠姐说：“夫人！我简直要跪下来求你了。我们一不要你悔过，二不要你自新，仅仅请你向国旗敬一个礼，也就是低一低头可以吗？”
    珠姐坚定地说：“我不会低头。我对一个奴才政权只有仇恨，我决不能向这面肮脏的旗子行礼。”
    “你当真不希望得到政府的宽恕吗？”
    “我清白无罪，并不希望谁来宽恕。”
    “你希望什么呢？”
    “我希望能到院子里晒太阳。”
    “这好说，马上给你解决。不过你也不妨稍微向我们表示一点友善。比如说，别人向国旗敬礼的时候，你也随着站起来，不要你低头行礼，只在旁边站一站，这总是可以的吧？”
    “就是用枪口对准我，我也不会站起来。”
    “那末权当你病了，不能站起来。你就向我说一下，你愿意向国旗表示敬意也可以。”
    珠姐扭过头，懒得再理他。
    这个特务吼叫起来：“你这人，怎么革命革的这样笨，这样死板。讲两句和气话有什么要紧，讲了就释放你，你出去还不是该干什么干什么。”
    同狱难友们听见，哄堂大笑。特务少校象挨了棍子的恶狗一样，夹起尾巴溜了。
    特务少校满以为自己很聪明，满以为珠姐会上他的圈套。想不到珠姐是那样坚定，那样机警，不把一丝一毫的可乘之隙留给敌人。我们为珠姐的“笨”和“死板”感到骄傲。这个文静瘦弱的姑娘，用钢铁般的意志捍卫了无产阶级战士崇高的革命气节。正如她在自己诗句里所说的那样，她是一座海边巨岩，在狂风骇浪冲击下傲然屹立，寸步不退！
    六
    敌人硬的软的都可耻地失败了，珠姐同敌人进行了一千三百多天的英勇斗争，走出了监狱，回到了自己的家。全家人又是惊喜又是难过。祖母见孙女被折磨得不成样子，抱着她哭了。母亲知道她在家里住不下来，对珠姐说：“你现在身子太亏了，好好在家养几天，等养好些，该往哪儿你自管去，我不拦着你。”珠姐多么想和亲人们待在一起，但心里总觉得空空落落的，她迫不及待地要找到党，接受党交给她的战斗任务。珠姐只在家里待了两天，就去找组织接关系，随后就到解放区来了。
    在珠姐入狱后五个月，她的未婚夫黎鸿司同志也被捕了。他和黎光咏等十几位青年，要用手榴弹炸死美国“大使”瑙尔汀，不幸被捕。《南方来信》第一集第八封信，记述了这个使敌人丢魂丧胆的事件。黎鸿司曾被流放到昆仑岛，去年十月间又解回西贡，敌人宣布要处死他。
    我们问珠姐，在狱中和黎鸿司同志见没见过面，珠姐说：“没见过。他曾经托人问我好，带给我一件礼物，是用硬币刻成的一颗心，一面雕的是镰刀斧头，一面雕着TC，这是我们两人名字的缩写。可惜这件礼物被敌人搜去了。”
    珠姐拿出一张黎鸿司同志的照片给我们看。他是一个英气勃勃的青年，光亮的眼睛，凝望着前方。照片下首印着一行字，这是他在特别军事法庭上，被宣判死刑的时候回答敌人的一句话：“可惜我没有足够的手榴弹，来把美国强盗杀光！”我们久久望着那刚强的年轻的面容，觉得这话不是印在照片上的，而是他以坚定洪亮的声音在向世界呼喊。
    停了一会，珠姐说：“他对同志，性子倒是很绵的。记得一些进步同学一起去野游，天气凉，他总是把自己的毯子给别人盖。有的同学对他耍脾气，过后问他：‘你生我的气吗？’他说：‘我心里填满了对你们的友情，那里还有空隙生出气来。’他就是这样的一个人！”
    珠姐用了很少的话，把她的未婚夫黎鸿司介绍给我们了。黎鸿司同志对敌人恨，恨得刻骨，对同志爱，爱得深沉。就是这样一个心地纯洁善良的年轻人，就是这样一个高中还没有毕业的学生，美伪集团正随时在打算杀害他。人们正以怒火燃烧的眼睛密切注视着，决不许杀害黎鸿司——越南人民优秀的儿子！
    我们要和珠姐娟姐握手道别了。她们接受邀请，到阮文追小学去访问。她们顺着林间小路走去，走出不几步，就隐没在稠密的树丛中，爽朗的笑声，却还在丛林中回荡。我们望着珠姐和娟姐走去的方向，谈论着自己的感受。我们知道，在南方，阮氏珠同志这样的人是数不尽的，可以说很平常。正因为平常，也就更了不起，千千万万个阮氏珠，在敌人面前所表现的宁死不低头的英雄气概，不也正体现了越南民族坚贞不屈的英雄性格吗！（附图片）

    她艰难地移动身体，靠近墙壁，取下头发夹子，用尽全身力量，把她的诗句刻在牢房墙壁上。
    珠姐坚定地说：“我不会低头。我对一个奴才政权只有仇恨，我决不能向这面肮脏的旗子行礼。”
