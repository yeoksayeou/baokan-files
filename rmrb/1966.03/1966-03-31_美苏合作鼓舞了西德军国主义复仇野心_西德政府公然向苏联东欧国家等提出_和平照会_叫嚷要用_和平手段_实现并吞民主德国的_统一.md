    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 28th -- This agency's reporter reports: The West German government delivered a "Peace Note" to more than one hundred countries, including the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, on the 25th, attempting to take advantage of the new situation in which the United States and the Soviet Union are pursuing a policy of "détente" in Western Europe and shifting their strategic focus to Asia. It uses words like "peace" and "disarmament" to conceal the ambitions of West German militarism and revanchism, in order to paralyze the vigilance of European countries against such ambitions.

    This note, which West German Chancellor Erhard described as "depicting the picture of Germany's (referring to West Germany) peaceful policy," joined the grand chorus of the United States and the Soviet Union, saying that it wanted to prevent "a new war that would destroy all countries, peoples, and the whole world," to implement "universal and supervised disarmament," and to "renounce the use of force" and implement "international cooperation." However, through these deceptive words, this note insists on the consistent position of the West German government: First, to achieve the so-called German "reunification" by annexing the German Democratic Republic; second, to restore the borders of Hitler's Germany in 1937; and third, to seek access to nuclear weapons through the US-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    According to Erhard's introduction to the content of this "Peace Note" in parliament on the 25th, the West German government emphasized in the note the "determination to seek German reunification by peaceful means," that is, to "justly resolve the German question" through "self-determination," as the first foothold of West Germany's "peaceful policy." Erhard said that only in this way "can all efforts for security and disarmament... achieve decisive and lasting achievements."

    The note stated that West Germany wants to "improve" relations with Eastern European countries. It said that West Germany is "trying in various ways to improve relations with various countries and nations in Eastern Europe," and "overall, the results are satisfactory," which "encourages" the West German government to "continue to implement this policy." It also expressed the belief that "the Soviet Union has repeatedly declared that it does not want war" is "serious," and suggested that West Germany exchange declarations of "renunciation of the use of force" with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. However, when it comes to the issue of borders, the note cannot hide the territorial ambitions of West German militarism and revanchism towards Eastern European countries. It said: "As long as a pan-German government freely elected does not recognize other borders, Germany will continue to exist within the borders of December 31, 1937."

    On the issues of disarmament and nuclear weapons, the note imitated the tone of the United States and the Soviet Union, advocating that "nuclear states reach an agreement not to hand over nuclear weapons to other countries," requiring non-nuclear countries to "express their renunciation of the production of nuclear weapons," and be prepared to accept "international supervision." It promoted that West Germany favors "gradually reducing nuclear weapons in Europe" and advocated "supervising" the use of fissile materials. However, while making the above gestures, the Erhard government's note showed that West Germany would never abandon its ambition to rely on the United States to gain access to nuclear weapons. It blatantly claimed that all allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including West Germany, "will jointly be responsible for participating in nuclear defense." The West German government's "Peace Note" was immediately welcomed by the United States. On the same day the note was issued, US Secretary of State Rusk said that this was an "important statement of policy" by West Germany, "very constructive, very progressive." The British Foreign Office also formally expressed "welcome."

    美苏合作鼓舞了西德军国主义复仇野心
    西德政府公然向苏联东欧国家等提出“和平照会”
    叫嚷要用“和平手段”实现并吞民主德国的“统一”
    据新华社波恩二十八日电 本社记者报道：西德政府二十五日向包括苏联东欧国家在内的一百多个国家递交了一份“和平照会”，企图利用美国同苏联在西欧推行“缓和”政策而把战略重点移到亚洲的这种新形势，用“和平”、“裁军”的词汇来掩盖西德军国主义和复仇主义的野心，以麻痹欧洲各国人民对这种野心的警惕。
    被西德总理艾哈德说成是“描绘了德国（指西德）和平政策的图景”的这个照会，参加了美国和苏联的大合唱，说什么要防止“摧毁所有的国家、人民和全世界的新战争”，要实行“世界范围的全面而有监督的裁军”，要“放弃使用武力”而实行“国际合作”。但是，透过这些迷惑人的词句，这份照会坚持的是西德政府的一贯立场：一、要实现并吞德意志民主共和国的所谓德国“重新统一”；二、要恢复一九三七年希特勒德国的边界；三、要通过美国控制的北大西洋集团染指核武器。
    根据艾哈德二十五日在议会对这份“和平照会”内容所作的介绍，西德政府在照会中强调了“用和平手段谋求德国重新统一的决心”，也就是所谓通过“自决”去“公正地解决德国问题”，作为西德“和平政策”的第一个落脚点。艾哈德说，只有这样，“为安全和裁军作出的所有努力……才能取得决定性和持久性的成就”。
    照会表示西德要同东欧国家“改善”关系。它说，西德正在“试图以各种方式改善同东欧各个国家和民族的关系”，而且“总的来说，结果是令人满意的”，这“鼓舞”了西德政府去“继续执行这种方针”。它还表示相信“苏联一再宣称它不希望战争”这一点是“认真的”，并且建议由西德同苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国交换“放弃使用武力”的声明。但是，一谈到边界问题，照会就掩饰不住西德军国主义和复仇主义对东欧国家的领土野心。它说：“只要没有从自由选举中产生的一个全德政府承认其他的边界，德国就继续存在于一九三七年十二月三十一日的边界之内。”
    在有关裁军和核武器的问题上，照会仿效美国和苏联的腔调，主张“核国家达成一致意见，不把核武器交给其他国家支配”，要求无核国家“表示放弃生产核武器”，并且准备接受“国际监督”。它宣传西德赞成“逐步减少在欧洲的核武器”，并且主张对裂变物质的用途进行“监督”。但是，在作出上面种种姿态的同时，艾哈德政府的这份照会表明，西德绝不肯放弃依靠美国染指核武器的野心。它明目张胆地声称，包括西德在内的北大西洋集团“所有盟国将共同负责参加核防务”。西德政府的这份“和平照会”立刻受到了美国的欢迎。在照会发出的当天，美国国务卿腊斯克就说，这是西德“政策的重要声明”，“很有建设意义，很有进取意义”。英国外交部也正式表示“欢迎”。
