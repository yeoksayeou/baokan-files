	Brief Comments
	No Difference
	U.S. State Department Press Officer McCloskey said that the U.S. plans to destroy crops and promote food production in South Vietnam were "not inconsistent."
	This seemingly absurd statement actually has its logic. The so-called "U.S. plan to promote food production in South Vietnam" is just a deceptive cover, serving its aggressive purposes in South Vietnam. Therefore, in terms of purpose, it is indeed completely consistent with the crime of destroying crops.
	Wasted Effort
	Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has been unable to solve India's food shortage and has repeatedly called on the Indian people to "change their eating habits" and "make do."
	The Indian people are accustomed to eating rice. Of course, if there is a shortage of rice and there is flour, the Indian people would probably be willing to give up their habit of eating rice and switch to noodles or bread. The problem is that Mrs. Gandhi said when talking about the food situation in India: "There is a shortage of everything in the country." Therefore, does the Prime Minister want the people to develop a habit of not eating food? But the people find it difficult to comply because they all want to live. Therefore, the anti-hunger struggle inevitably rises everywhere. It seems that Mrs. Gandhi's repeated appeals are in vain.

    三言两语
    并无二致
    美国国务院新闻发布官麦克洛斯基说，美国在南越毁坏庄稼和促进南越粮食生产的计划“并不是不一致的”。
    这种听来绝顶荒谬的说法，其实是有它的道理的。美国的所谓“促进南越粮食生产计划”不过是一个骗人的幌子，是为它在南越的侵略目的服务的。因此，从目的上来说，它和毁坏庄稼的罪行的确是完全一致的。
    枉费心机
    印度总理甘地夫人无法解决印度的粮荒，一再呼吁印度人民“改变他们的饮食习惯”，“凑合过去”。
    印度人民是习惯于吃大米的。当然，如果缺大米而有面粉，恐怕印度人民是会愿意放弃他们吃米的习惯，改吃面条或面包的。问题是甘地夫人在谈到印度的粮食情况时说：“国内什么都缺乏”。因此，总理阁下是不是要人民养成一种不吃粮食的习惯呢？但老百姓可是碍难遵行，因为他们都还想活命。于是，反饥饿斗争就不可避免地到处兴起。看来，甘地夫人再三呼吁也是枉然的。
