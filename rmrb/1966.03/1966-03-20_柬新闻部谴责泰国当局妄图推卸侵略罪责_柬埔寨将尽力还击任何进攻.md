    According to a March 18th report from the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh: The Cambodian Ministry of Information issued a communique on March 17th, stating that Thailand should be held responsible for the border incidents with Cambodia, as these incidents were all provoked by Thai troops.
    The Ministry of Information of the Royal Government pointed out: "For several months, the border incidents that have occurred in Koh Kong province along the Cambodian coast, as well as in the border areas of other Cambodian provinces bordering Thailand, have all been provoked by Thai troops."
    The communique sternly refuted the absurd claim in Bangkok newspapers that the recent border incident in the Chi Neas area of Koh Kong province, provoked by Thai troops, was initiated by Cambodian troops.
    The communique stated that Thailand's propaganda is clearly an attempt to shift responsibility for these incidents onto Cambodia while frantically threatening Cambodia. The communique pointed out that just twenty-four hours ago, Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn announced that he had ordered the Thai Air Force and Navy to bomb our border outposts if necessary.
    The communique said, "Thailand's malicious conspiracies and clamorous threats cannot intimidate us, and we know that they alone should be held responsible for these border incidents, and they alone should be held responsible if they intensify their aggression and worsen the situation."
    The Ministry of Information of the Royal Government of Cambodia stated: "Cambodia will do its utmost to repel any attack, but it will never proactively provoke incidents with neighboring countries."
    According to a March 18th report from the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh, on the morning of March 16th, Thai troops stationed at the Ha Lek outpost used automatic weapons to attack Cambodian military installations in the Chi Neas area of Koh Kong province, Cambodia.
    At the same time, two Thai warships in the coastal waters of Ha Lek also used heavy weapons to attack Cambodian military installations in the Chang Yang area near Chi Neas in support of the Thai troops' attack. Cambodian soldiers launched a fierce counterattack. The two sides exchanged fire for about three hours.
    The news agency also reported that Thai troops had attacked several provincial defense force outposts within Koh Kong province, Cambodia, five times on February 28th, March 1st, 2nd, and 4th. During the same period, Thai aircraft had violated Cambodian airspace in Koh Kong province twelve times.

    柬新闻部谴责泰国当局妄图推卸侵略罪责
    柬埔寨将尽力还击任何进攻
    据新华社金边十八日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十八日报道，柬埔寨新闻部十七日发表公报指出，泰国应对它同柬埔寨的边境事件负责，这些事件都是由泰国军队挑起的。
    王国政府新闻部指出：“几个月来，在柬埔寨沿海的戈公省发生的边境事件，正如在同泰国接壤的柬埔寨其他省份的边境地区发生的事件一样，都是由泰国军队挑起的。”
    公报严正驳斥曼谷报纸把泰国军队最近在戈公省奇内萨地区挑起的边境事件说成是柬埔寨军队挑起的荒谬说法。
    公报说，泰国的宣传显然是企图在疯狂威胁柬埔寨的同时把这些事件的责任推给柬埔寨。公报指出，仅仅在二十四小时以前，泰国总理他侬·吉滴卡宗曾宣布，他已经命令泰国空军和海军在必要时轰炸我国的边境哨所。
    公报说，“泰国的恶毒阴谋和吵吵嚷嚷的威胁决不能吓倒我们，而且我们知道，这些边境事件应由他们单独负责，如果他们加紧进行侵略而使局势恶化的话，这也应该由他们单独负责。”
    柬埔寨王国政府新闻部指出：“柬埔寨将尽力对任何攻击进行还击，但是它决不会主动对邻国挑起事件。”
    新华社金边十八日电据柬埔寨新闻社十八日报道，三月十六日上午，驻扎在哈勒哨所的泰国军队用自动武器袭击柬埔寨戈公省奇内萨地方的柬埔寨军事设施。
    同时，在哈勒沿海的两艘泰国军舰也用重武器袭击奇内萨附近昌扬地方的柬埔寨军事设施，以支援泰国军队的袭击。柬埔寨士兵进行了猛烈的反击。双方交火约三小时。
    这家通讯社还报道，二月二十八日，三月一日、二日和四日，泰国军队曾经五次袭击柬埔寨戈公省境内的几个省防军哨所。同一期间，泰国飞机曾经十二次侵犯柬埔寨戈公省的领空。
