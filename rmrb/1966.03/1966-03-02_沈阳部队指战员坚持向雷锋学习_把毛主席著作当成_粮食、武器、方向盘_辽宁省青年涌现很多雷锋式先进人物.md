    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st—Through a long-term campaign of "Learning from Comrade Lei Feng," the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has propelled the mass movement of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings to a new level. The broad masses of commanders and fighters are studying more actively and applying more effectively, and a large number of advanced units and advanced individuals have emerged.

    Three years ago, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." Today, the leading organs of the Shenyang Military Region held a conference calling on all commanders and fighters to further respond to Chairman Mao's great call, learn from Comrade Lei Feng more deeply and persistently, and launch a new upsurge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings that is even greater and more effective.

    Those attending the conference included Qiang Xiaochu, Zeng Siyu, Liu Zhuanlian, Zhang Qingtai, and other responsible persons from the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shenyang Military Region, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, the government, the military, and the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, the government, and the military; all the soldiers from the squad Lei Feng belonged to; and more than 1,500 activists from various units in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Tian Weixin, a responsible person from the Shenyang Military Region, reported on the situation of the "Learning from Comrade Lei Feng" campaign in the Shenyang Military Region over the past three years.

    Tian Weixin pointed out in his report that the broad masses of commanders and fighters have seen from Comrade Lei Feng's glorious life that the most valuable aspect of Lei Feng's outstanding qualities is that he treated Chairman Mao's writings as "food, weapons, steering wheel," and tirelessly used Mao Zedong Thought to arm his minds. Therefore, when learning from Lei Feng, everyone first learned from Lei Feng by creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings to transform their thinking. Some units also used small-scale rectification methods to study "Serve the People," using Chairman Mao's view of serving the people wholeheartedly as a weapon, comparing it with Lei Feng's revolutionary spirit, and solving practical ideological problems. In this way, the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's writings has greatly advanced, accelerating the pace of revolutionizing and combatizing the troops.

    Tian Weixin pointed out in his report that, because Mao Zedong Thought has armed the minds of commanders and fighters, their ideological horizons have become even higher. Many soldiers said: As long as my heart is beating, my mind will be filled with the 650 million Chinese people and the two-thirds of the world's people who have not yet been liberated. In order to support the world revolution, many people consciously link their words and deeds with the world revolution. In their work, they are not afraid of hardship or fatigue. During training, they proceed from the needs of actual combat and demand strictness and difficulty.

    The communist style of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self" has been greatly promoted in the army. Many cadres and soldiers can not only care for comrades politically with the spirit of "helping one more comrade to progress means one more force for the revolution," but also ensure that when one person is sick, everyone takes care of them, and when one person is in trouble, everyone supports them. A large number of good deeds have emerged in various units, and "volunteer barbers" and "volunteer shoe repairers" are also increasing. They said: "Doing good deeds for others, the purpose is to unite everyone to make revolution. We must do things that are a hundred times disadvantageous to ourselves, but beneficial to others!"

    Tian Weixin said in his report that to learn from Lei Feng, we must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, treat Chairman Mao's writings as the highest instructions, and make great efforts to focus on "application" at all times. Application means revolution, revolutionizing the subjective world, revolutionizing the objective world. First, revolutionize the subjective world. To revolutionize the subjective world, we must resolutely eliminate selfishness, transform our non-proletarian world outlook, and establish a proletarian world outlook. To revolutionize the subjective world, we must have a high standard and not be satisfied with "passable" or "almost," but must take Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu as examples, make revolution for a lifetime, study Chairman Mao's writings for a lifetime, transform our thinking for a lifetime, and forever maintain revolutionary youth.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st—The broad masses of young people in Liaoning Province have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," and have carried out activities to learn from Lei Feng in a sustained and in-depth manner for three years, and a large number of Lei Feng-style advanced figures have emerged.

    In the activities of learning from Lei Feng in this province, young people first regarded Chairman Mao's writings as "food, weapons, steering wheel," like Lei Feng, studied Chairman Mao's books diligently, acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and constantly improved their class consciousness. Lu Jiashan, a returned educated youth from Gaixian County, understood the principle that farming is making revolution after learning from Lei Feng, insisted on scientific experiments, and successively carried out research on more than 30 projects such as fine variety cultivation, rational close planting, and pest and disease control, 19 of which were applied in large-scale production. Zheng Kuangguang and Shen Kexi, members of the Communist Youth League and young people from the Fushun Petroleum Design Institute, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" with Lei Feng as an example in order to solve technical problems in transporting petroleum. Braving wind and snow, they followed the train for observation, traveled more than 5,000 kilometers, and spent more than 20 days, obtained a large amount of first-hand information, and finally broke through the technical barrier.

    The broad masses of young people have also taken Lei Feng as an example, highly promoted the revolutionary spirit of serving the revolution wholeheartedly, everything for the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly, and the fine style of hard work, pioneering, and frugality. Young miners in the coal capital of Fushun widely carried out activities to recover waste materials. The young people of the iron smelting plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company inherited the tradition of frugality of the old hero Meng Tai. After learning from Lei Feng, they have saved more than 125,000 yuan of wealth for the country over the years.

    In the places where Lei Feng worked before his death, the activities of learning from Lei Feng are even more in-depth and extensive. The young people of the coal washing workshop of the Anshan Chemical Plant often carry out "Remembering Lei Feng" activities. Li Shaozhen, a young man who drives the bulldozer that Lei Feng drove before his death, takes Lei Feng as an example everywhere, creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's writings, and has become a "Five-Good Youth League Member" and an expert in saving. Chen Yajuan, a student of Benxi Road Primary School in Wanghua District, Fushun City, who was mentored by Lei Feng when he was a tutor, has been like Lei Feng for several years, utterly devoted to others without any thought of self, doing good deeds for the people, and studying for the revolution. Now she is a student at Fushun No. 18 Middle School, gloriously joined the Communist Youth League, and serves as the secretary of the League branch in her class.

    沈阳部队指战员坚持向雷锋学习
    把毛主席著作当成“粮食、武器、方向盘”
    辽宁省青年涌现很多雷锋式先进人物
    据新华社沈阳一日电  中国人民解放军沈阳部队通过长期开展“向雷锋同志学习”的活动，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新的水平，广大指战员学得越来越活，用得越来越好，涌现出大批先进单位和先进人物。
    三年前，毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召。今天，沈阳部队领导机关举行大会，号召全体指战员进一步响应毛主席的伟大号召，更加深入持久地向雷锋同志学习，掀起一个更大更有成效的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    参加大会的有中共中央东北局、沈阳部队、辽宁省和沈阳市党、政府、军队的负责人强晓初、曾思玉、刘转连、张庆泰等，有雷锋生前所在班的全体战士和各部队学习毛主席著作积极分子等一千五百多人。沈阳部队负责人田维新在会上报告了三年来沈阳部队开展“向雷锋同志学习”的情况。
    田维新在报告中指出，广大指战员从雷锋同志光辉的一生中看到：雷锋优秀品质中最宝贵的一条，就是他把毛主席著作当成“粮食、武器、方向盘”，孜孜不倦地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。因此，大家学雷锋时，首先是象雷锋那样活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想。有些单位还用小整风方法学习《为人民服务》，以毛主席全心全意为人民服务的观点为武器，对照雷锋的革命精神，解决现实思想问题。这样，学习毛主席著作的群众运动就大大向前发展了，加快了部队革命化、战斗化建设的步伐。
    田维新在报告中指出，由于毛泽东思想武装了指战员的头脑，指战员们的思想境界更高了。许多战士说：只要我心在跳，我脑瓜里就装着六亿五千万中国人民和三分之二没有解放的世界人民。为了支援世界革命，许多人自觉地把自己的一言一行，一举一动同世界革命联系在一起。工作中，不怕苦，不怕累，训练时，从实战需要出发从严从难。
      “毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义风格，在部队里得到了极大的发扬。不少干部战士不仅能以“多帮助一个同志进步，革命就多了一分力量”的精神，去从政治上关心同志，而且做到了一人有病，大家照顾，一人有事，八方支援。各个单位都出现了大量的好人好事，“义务理发员”、“义务修鞋工”等也越来越多。他们说：“做好事为别人，目的是团结大家干革命，对自己一百个不利，对别人有一利的事也要做！”
    田维新在报告中说，学雷锋就要活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席著作当做最高指示，时刻要在“用”字上狠下功夫。用，就是革命，革主观世界的命，革客观世界的命。首先是革主观世界的命。要革主观世界的命，就要坚决除去私心，改造自己的非无产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。要革主观世界的命，就要有个高标准，不能满足于“过得去”、“差不多”，必须以雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄为榜样，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，永葆革命的青春。
    据新华社沈阳一日电辽宁省广大青年热烈响应毛主席“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，持续三年深入地开展学习雷锋的活动，涌现出大批雷锋式的先进人物。
    这个省的青年在向雷锋学习的活动中，首先象雷锋那样把毛主席著作当作“粮食、武器、方向盘”，刻苦读毛主席的书，按毛主席指示办事，阶级觉悟不断提高。盖县回乡知识青年吕家善，学习雷锋以后，懂得了种田就是干革命的道理，坚持科学试验，先后进行了良种培育、合理密植、防治病虫害等三十多个项目的研究，其中有十九项在大面积生产中应用。抚顺石油设计院共青团员郑匡光、青年沈克西，为解决运载石油途中的技术难题，以雷锋为榜样反复学习了毛主席的《实践论》，冒着风雪严寒，跟车观察，随车往返五千余公里，历时二十余天，取得了大批第一手资料，终于攻破了技术关。
    广大青年还以雷锋为榜样，高度发扬了一心为革命、一切为革命、全心全意为人民服务的革命精神和艰苦创业、勤俭节约的优良作风。煤都抚顺青年矿工广泛开展回收废旧物资活动。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的青年，继承老英雄孟泰的勤俭节约的传统，学习雷锋以后，几年来，为国家节约财富达十二万五千多元。
    雷锋生前工作过的地方，学雷锋的活动更加深入广泛。鞍钢化工总厂洗煤车间的青年们经常开展“忆雷锋”活动。驾驶雷锋生前驾驶过的推土机的青年李绍臣，处处以雷锋为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，成为五好团员和节约能手。雷锋任辅导员时辅导过的前抚顺市望花区本溪路小学学生陈雅娟，几年来象雷锋那样，毫不利己，专门利人，为人民办好事，为革命而学习。现在她已是抚顺市十八中学的学生，光荣地参加了共青团，并担任了班里的团支部书记。
