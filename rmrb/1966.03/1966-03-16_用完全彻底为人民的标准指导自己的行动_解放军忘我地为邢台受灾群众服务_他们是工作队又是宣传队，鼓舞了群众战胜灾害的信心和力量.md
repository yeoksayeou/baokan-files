    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, 15th - After the Xingtai area of Hebei Province suffered an earthquake disaster, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops who came to provide disaster relief, with deep class feelings, selflessly served the disaster area masses, making a significant contribution to helping restore the lives and production of the disaster area masses.
    The People's Liberation Army is the main force in this disaster relief struggle. The commanders and fighters were dispersed to all disaster-stricken villages, visited most of the affected households, and carried out rescue work day and night. Some were treating injured people in "field hospitals," some were delivering water and food to the injured, some were rushing to build temporary housing, or digging out clothing and grain buried under collapsed houses. They are both work teams and propaganda teams. Disaster area villages are full of slogans posted by the People's Liberation Army; commanders and fighters also participate in mass gatherings or study Chairman Mao's quotations with the masses, boosting the morale of the masses. At night, while the masses are fast asleep, the commanders and fighters are still holding meetings in the camp outside the village, checking their day's work against Chairman Mao's teaching of serving the people completely and thoroughly. All this has brought the disaster area masses infinite confidence and strength to overcome the disaster.
    This people's army, from the moment it received the disaster relief order, has taken the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the foundation for doing a good job in disaster relief, emphasizing that putting politics first in every specific task. All commanders and fighters take Mao Zedong Thought as the supreme instruction, and take the successful completion of the disaster relief task as the best practice of living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, resulting in a large number of inspiring good people and good deeds. An engineering company of a certain unit, which has been rated as a "Four Good Company" for four consecutive years, proposed to use the standard of serving the people completely and thoroughly to guide every specific action. They repaired more than eighty miles of highway and built a thirty-meter-long bridge in two days, ensuring the smooth passage of disaster relief vehicles. Li Jixian, a soldier of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, received two telegrams before departure stating that his father was critically ill. He said, "My father is ill, it is just him alone, and there is collective care. When many class brothers are in trouble, I cannot go home." Zhou Quanwen, the third platoon leader of a certain unit, whose home is in the earthquake-stricken area, was allowed by his leaders to go back and see. He said, "More parents and brothers need us, I cannot only care about myself." Bai Shunkao, another squad leader from the disaster area, passed by his home without entering, working for a day and a night without eating. In the first day or two of entering the village, soldiers of a certain company saw that some people did not have quilts to cover themselves because their houses had collapsed, so they secretly gave their own quilts to the disaster victims. Zhao Shuzhen, a military doctor of a certain unit, saw that a disaster victim named Gu Haiming was injured, his throat was blocked by thick phlegm, he had difficulty breathing, and was in a coma. He inserted a rubber tube into the patient's throat and sucked out the thick phlegm with his mouth, bringing the patient back from danger. Li Gang, a soldier of a certain unit, heard that on the second day of the earthquake, a child was just born, and the mother died due to excessive bleeding. The child's father was working outside, and the grandfather and grandmother were crying in distress. Pan Zhonghe, a training team member of a certain unit, comforted them, saying: The child is a descendant of the revolution and must be raised well. He asked someone in the city to buy condensed milk and a bottle, sent it to the child's home and asked a nurse to help feed it. For three consecutive days, no matter how busy he was, he always went to visit once or twice.
    While carrying out disaster relief work, this PLA unit also vigorously launched propaganda activities to inspire the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. They posted Chairman Mao's quotations and slogans such as "Highlight Politics and Overcome Disasters" and "Self-Reliance and Rebuild Our Homes" on the simple houses built for the disaster victims. Many companies organized propaganda teams to visit households and conduct propaganda to the masses. After entering the village, the first company of an engineering unit combined labor and propaganda, helping one household and talking to them, talking to anyone they met, widely promoting Mao Zedong Thought to the masses and boosting their confidence in fighting the disaster. Li Erfa, a poor peasant who had fled famine before liberation and worked as a hired hand for landlords for twelve years, told the soldiers: "Chairman Mao is the great benefactor of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the PLA has conveyed Chairman Mao's words to us. In the future, I must take the lead in shouldering the banner of revolution." Old poor peasant Ren Yusi has been studying Chairman Mao's works for a long time. He enthusiastically called the soldiers living Zhang Side and Bethune, and pointed to Chairman Mao's works and said to the soldiers: "With this, we are not afraid of any difficulty."
    After several days of disaster relief work, the flesh-and-blood relationship between this army and the local people, which was established as early as the revolutionary war years, has become even stronger. Moving scenes of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army have appeared in many villages in the disaster area. Seeing the troops sleeping outside the village, the masses took the initiative to bring quilts and secretly cover the soldiers. Some, seeing that the soldiers could not get water to drink, boiled water and sent it to the soldiers. Some sent eggs and insisted that the soldiers eat them. Cui Jingzhi, a soldier of a certain unit, built a house for an old woman surnamed Wei and gave her condolences. The old woman refused to accept anything. She said with tears in her eyes: "With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with such a good army of ours, I can overcome any difficulties, and I will never bow to difficulties!"

    用完全彻底为人民的标准指导自己的行动
    解放军忘我地为邢台受灾群众服务
    他们是工作队又是宣传队，鼓舞了群众战胜灾害的信心和力量
    新华社邢台十五日电　河北省邢台地区遭受地震灾害后，前来救灾的中国人民解放军部队指战员，带着深厚的阶级感情，忘我地为灾区群众服务，对帮助恢复灾区群众的生活和生产，作出了重大贡献。
    人民解放军是这次救灾斗争的主力。指战员们分散到所有受灾的村，访问了大多数受灾的户，日夜突击进行抢救工作。他们有的在“战地医院”里为受伤的群众治疗，有的为受伤的人送水送饭，有的在突击修建临时住房，或者挖掘被房屋倒塌埋掉的衣物和粮食。他们既是工作队，又是宣传队。灾区的村庄，到处都有解放军张贴的标语；指战员们还分头参加群众的集会或同群众一起学习毛主席语录，鼓舞群众的斗志。晚上，当群众熟睡了的时候，指战员们还在村外的营地里开会，对照着毛主席说的完全、彻底地为人民服务的教导来检查自己一天的工作。这一切给灾区群众带来了战胜灾害的无限信心和力量。
    这支人民军队，从接到救灾命令的时候起，就把活学活用毛主席著作作为做好救灾工作的根本，强调在每项具体工作中都把突出政治放在第一位。全体指战员以毛泽东思想为最高指示，把胜利完成救灾任务作为活学活用毛主席著作最好的实践，出现了大量激动人心的好人好事。曾经连续四年被评为“四好连队”的某部工兵一连，提出要以完全、彻底为人民服务的标准来指导每一具体行动，他们在两天内就修复公路八十多里，新建一座三十米长的桥梁，使救灾车辆畅通无阻。某部四连战士李继先出发前，接到父亲病危的两封电报，他说：“我父亲病了只是他一个人，何况还有集体照顾，在许多阶级兄弟遭到困难的时候，我不能回家去。”某部三排长周全文家在地震灾区，领导上让他回去看看，他说：“更多的父母兄弟正需要我们，我不能只顾自己。”另一个家在灾区的班长白顺考，路过家门不入，一天一夜顾不上吃饭坚持工作。进村的头一两天，某连战士看到有些群众因为房屋倒塌，没有被子盖，便偷偷把自己的被子给灾民盖上。某部军医赵树祯看到灾民古海明受伤后，喉咙里被浓痰塞住，呼吸困难，处于昏迷状态，就用橡皮管插到病人喉管里，用嘴吸出浓痰，使病人转危为安。某部战士李刚听说一位双目失明的老大娘家里没人照顾，他便给老大娘送饭、喂饭，他对老大娘说：“是毛主席派我来侍候你老人家的。你就把我当做你的儿子吧！”这几天李刚每天都要去送几次饭，他一去，老大娘就摸着他问：“是我的儿子来了吗？”李刚和老大娘简直成了一家人，老大娘遇到什么事都要找他商量。某部训练队潘忠和听说地震的第二天，一个小孩刚生出来，母亲便因流血过多死去，孩子的爸爸在外面工作，爷爷和奶奶愁得直哭。潘忠和劝慰他们说：孩子是革命的后代，一定要想法带好。他托人在城里买了炼乳和奶瓶，送到孩子家并请护士帮助喂养，一连三天，每天不管多忙，他总要去看望一两次。
    这支解放军部队在进行救灾工作的同时，还大力展开宣传活动，用毛泽东思想鼓舞群众。他们在为灾民修建的简易房屋上，贴上毛主席语录和“突出政治，战胜灾害”，“自力更生，重建家园”等标语。许多连队组织了宣传队，逐户访问，向群众进行宣传。工兵某部一连进村后，边劳动，边宣传，帮一户，讲一户，遇一人，讲一人，广泛向群众宣传毛泽东思想，鼓舞群众抗灾的信心。一个曾在解放前逃过荒、给地主扛了十二年活的贫农李二发对战士们说：“毛主席是贫农下中农的大恩人，解放军又把毛主席的话传达给我们，今后我一定要带头扛起革命的大旗。”老贫农任玉四长期学习毛主席著作，他热情地叫战士们是活的张思德、白求恩，他对战士们指着毛主席著作说：“有了这个，天大的困难也不怕”。
    经过几天的救灾工作，这支军队和当地人民之间早在革命战争年代就建立起来的血肉相联的感情，显得更加深厚了。灾区的许多村庄里出现了军爱民、民拥军的动人场面。群众看到部队露宿村外，主动拿来被子偷偷地给战士们盖上。有的看到战士喝不上水，就烧了开水送给战士们喝。有的送来了鸡蛋，硬要战士们吃。某部战士崔景智给一个姓魏的老大娘盖了房子，又给老大娘送了慰问品。老大娘说什么也不收，她感动得流着眼泪说：“有党和毛主席的领导，有咱们这么好的军队，什么困难我也能克服，我绝不能向困难低头！”（附图片）
