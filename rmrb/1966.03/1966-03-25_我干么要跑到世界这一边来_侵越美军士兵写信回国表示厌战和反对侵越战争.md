    "Why Did I Run to This Side of the World?"
    US Soldiers in Vietnam Write Home Expressing War Weariness and Opposition to the Vietnam War
    The American weekly *National Guardian* published on the 19th an article titled "Instances of Corruption and Lying: A Letter from a Disillusioned Soldier in Vietnam." The editors of the *National Guardian* wrote that the report was an excerpt from a letter written by an American soldier in South Vietnam to a friend. This letter had been entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Church on March 4. Church said that this was a "letter worth considering calmly." He also said that the deletions in the letter presented as evidence were made to avoid revealing the soldier's name. The following is a translated excerpt of the letter:
    After personally experiencing the past five months here, I have never felt so disappointed in my country. This is the first time I have been at the scene of the news, and I realize that most reporters are not trying to accurately depict what is happening, but rather are writing what sells and exaggerating for fame and profit. Most of the combat photos, if not deliberately staged, are taken during rear training and presented as front-line combat photos. After the past few months of combat, I am quite clear about what can be done and what cannot be done. If you see a picture of a Viet Cong raising his hands and coming out of a cave, you can be sure it is a deliberately staged picture.
    The educated leaders of this country (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet regime) are corrupt, despicable, and completely thieving. They all hate the communists, but they all have large deposits in foreign banks. The amount of money they deposit in foreign banks each month is many times more than their salaries. In the area where I serve as a ×× (deleted) advisor and a psychological warfare advisor, the US government (through South Vietnamese channels) is paying the salaries of 338 staff members. These people are supposedly carrying out pacification work in an area with five villages, but only fifty or sixty people are working in that area. Therefore, this means that about ×× (number deleted) (South Vietnamese) government officials are embezzling about $4,000 per month. I reported this matter, but nothing happened. I raised so many ×× (deleted) about this matter that they transferred me to a direct combat unit.
    At the same time, the reports from the Vietnamese side are very optimistic, and you would think the war is almost won. They say we distributed four million pills and treated thousands of farmers, but we don't have any medicine at all. These things disappear completely before they reach us, and they are likely sold in the big cities. The losses of our battalion (totaling 250 men) are: 50 killed, 35 wounded, and 16 captured. I personally saw and helped drag away about 25 of our dead, but they reported that we only lost 12 people. But these false reports satisfy Washington. The emphasis is not on what we are doing or what progress is actually being made, but as long as you write that progress is being made, that's fine. They are living in a dream, but I am worried that they are just deceiving themselves and the American public, and in the end, they will suffer.
    For five months, I have been with the same Vietnamese infantry battalion and have seen a lot of fighting in our area ×× (deleted) miles south of Da Nang. I have been very close to death several times. I will be serving as an advisor to a cavalry unit north of ×× (deleted). They have had three advisors in the past year, two of whom were killed and the last one wounded. Two of them were very good friends of mine. Seeing my friends killed and wounded here, risking my life on the front lines every day, while the Vietnamese (referring to the puppets) themselves make no effort and ignore our efforts and sacrifices. Seeing these things makes me very angry. I ask myself, why do I have to run to this side of the world away from my wife, and I don't understand why I have to fight and risk death.
    The *National Guardian* also published on the 19th a letter from a soldier friend in South Vietnam received by a reader of the publication, titled "People Do Not Welcome." The following is a translated excerpt of the letter.
    I really don't know how we will get through such a year. This is truly hell. The weather is deadly hot, exceeding one hundred and ten degrees every day. Now to answer your question: The people here do not welcome us at all. They don't even want us to stay here. When we walk past them, they look at us with hatred. ... Many innocent South Vietnamese are killed, and many houses are burned down.
    The people do want to choose their own regime. The United States is indeed interfering. This desire will always exist. Sooner or later we will have to give up. I don't see how we can win. The South Vietnamese soldiers don't care at all. While we are fighting to the death, they are sleeping in the villages and drinking beer.
    If you ever see this place, you will not understand what we are doing here. The people here hate us.

### “我干么要跑到世界这一边来”  侵越美军士兵写信回国表示厌战和反对侵越战争

专栏：外论摘要

    “我干么要跑到世界这一边来”
    侵越美军士兵写信回国表示厌战和反对侵越战争
    美国《国民前卫》周刊十九日发表了一篇题为《腐败和说谎的实例：一个失望的士兵从越南写出的信》。《国民前卫》周刊的编者注说，这篇报道是美国在南越的一个士兵写给一个朋友的信的摘录。这封信已由参议员丘奇于三月四日列入国会记录。丘奇说，这是一封“值得冷静考虑的”信。他还说，这封列为证件的信件中删去的地方是为了不让人知道这位士兵的姓名。以下是这封信的摘译。
    我在这里亲身体验了五个来月以后，从来没有对我国感到如此失望。我是头一次来到出消息的现场，我认识到大多数记者并不是力图确切描绘所发生的情况，而是写出行销的东西并且为了追求名利而大肆渲染。大多数的战斗图片，要不是故意摆布拍摄的，就是在后方训练时拍摄的，而把它们说成是前线战斗的图片。经过过去几个月的战斗以后，我相当清楚地知道什么事是能够办到，什么事是办不到的。要是你看到一张一个越共高举双手从洞中出来的图片，你可以保险这是一张故意摆布出来的图片。
    这个国家（指南越伪政权）的受过教育的领导人是腐败的、卑鄙的、一塌糊涂的盗贼。他们都是仇恨共产党的，可是他们大家全都在外国银行有大批存款。他们每月在国外的银行储存的款项比他们的薪金多好几倍。在我担任××（删节）顾问并担任心理战的顾问的地区，美国政府（通过南越渠道）正支付三百三十八名工作人员的工资。这些人据说是要对一个有五个村的地区进行绥靖工作，然而在那个地区工作的只有五六十个人。因此这就是说大约××名（南越）政府官员每月贪污约四千美元。我把这件事作了汇报，但是什么事情也没有。我关于这件事提出了这么多的××（删节），他们就把我调到直接作战的单位来了。
    在这件事的同时，越南人打的报告是非常乐观的，你会以为战争几乎是打赢了。他们说我们散发了四百万药片，治疗了好几千农民，其实我们根本没有药品，这些东西到我们手中以前就全部无影无踪了，很可能是在大城市中卖掉了。我们这一营（共有二百五十人）的人的损失是：五十人被打死，三十五人受伤，十六人被俘虏。我亲眼看见还帮忙拖走我们的大约二十五个被打死的人，可是他们报告说我们仅仅损失了十二个人。但是这些假报告却使华盛顿感到满意。着重的不是我们正干什么事情或者是实际上取得什么进展，而是你只要写上正取得进展，那就行了。他们是生活在梦乡之中，但是我担心他们只是在欺骗自己和美国公众，到头来他们是要吃苦头的。
      我五个月来都是同一个越南步兵营呆在一起，在我们的距岘港以南××（删节）英里的地区内看到不少战斗。我有好几次都非常接近死亡。我将要在××（删节）以北的地方担任一支骑兵部队的顾问。过去一年来他们已经换了三个顾问，两个被打死，最后一个被打伤。其中两个都是我的很好的朋友。看到我的朋友在这里被打死打伤，我每天在前线上冒生命的危险，而越南人（指傀儡）自己却不做任何努力，并且对我们所做的努力和牺牲也不理睬。看到这些事情真使我非常生气。我问我自己，我干么非得要远离我的妻子跑到世界这一边来，我也不明白为什么我必须打仗和冒死亡的危险。
      十九日的《国民前卫》周刊还以《人民不欢迎》为题发表
  了该刊一位读者所收到的一个在南越当兵的朋友的来信。以下
  是这封信的摘译。
    我真不知道我们将如何度过这样的一年。这里真是一个地狱。天气热死人，每天都超过一百一十度。现在来回答你的问题：这里的人民根本不欢迎我们。他们甚至不想要我们呆在这里。我们走过他们身边，他们就以憎恶的眼光看我们。……有许多无辜的南越人被杀死，也有许多房屋被烧毁。
    人民的确希望让他们自己来选择他们的政权。美国确实是横加干涉。这种愿望将永远存在下去。我们迟早将不得不放弃。我看不出我们如何能够取胜。南越的士兵一点也不关心。当我们拼死命的时候，他们却在村子里睡大觉，喝啤酒。
    要是你有一天看到这个地方，你将不能理解我们在这里是搞些什么名堂。这里的人民痛恨我们。
