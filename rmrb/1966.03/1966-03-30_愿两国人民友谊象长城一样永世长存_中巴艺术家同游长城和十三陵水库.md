    Chinese and Pakistani Artists Tour the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs Reservoir

    Xinhua News Agency, 29th — Chinese and Pakistani artists today toured the ancient Great Wall and the Ming Tombs Reservoir together.
    A car filled with songs sped along the road leading to the Great Wall. Chinese and Pakistani artists sang loudly: "Our voices come together, surging and roaring. The people's strength comes together, overturning mountains and seas. The Chinese and Pakistani people unite, China and Pakistan unite against the enemy." This song, "The Chinese and Pakistani People Unite," was created by teachers and students of the China Conservatory of Music for the visit of the Pakistani Cultural and Art Troupe. The Pakistani artists quickly learned it, and the song reverberated in the valleys, drifting into the distance with the wind.
    Chinese and Pakistani artists ascended the Great Wall hand in hand, admiring the scenery of the ancient Great Wall. Rahman, the head of the Pakistani Cultural and Art Troupe, praised this great ancient Chinese architecture. He also said, "May the friendship between the people and artists of China and Pakistan be everlasting like the Great Wall." Pakistani friends happily sang the Chinese song "Commune Members are All Sunflowers," which they had just learned, on the Great Wall. Literary and art workers from the China Conservatory of Music and the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble also sang Pakistani folk songs with them.
    In the afternoon, Chinese and Pakistani artists held a get-together by the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Literary and art workers from the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble performed the Pakistani "Anklet Dance." Pakistani artists played Pakistani folk music and sang folk songs. The beautiful and moving songs and dances of the artists of the two countries aroused continuous applause from the audience.

    愿两国人民友谊象长城一样永世长存
    中巴艺术家同游长城和十三陵水库
    新华社二十九日讯  中国和巴基斯坦两国艺术家今天结伴漫游古长城和十三陵水库。
    满载歌声的汽车，在通往长城的马路上飞驰。中巴两国艺术家高唱：“歌声汇合在一起，汹涌澎湃，人民力量在一起，排山倒海。中国巴基斯坦两国人民团结起来，中国巴基斯坦共同对敌团结起来。”这首《中巴人民团结起来》的歌曲，是中国音乐学院师生为巴基斯坦文化艺术团的来访创作的。巴基斯坦艺术家们很快就学会了它，歌声在山谷中荡漾，随风飘向远方。
    中巴两国艺术家们手挽手地登上长城，观赏古长城的景色。巴基斯坦文化艺术团团长拉赫曼赞赏中国古代这一伟大建筑，他还说：“但愿巴中两国人民和艺术家的友谊象长城一样永世长存”。巴基斯坦朋友们在长城上欢乐地唱起他们刚学会的中国歌曲《社员都是向阳花》。中国音乐学院和东方歌舞团的文艺工作者们也同他们一起唱起了巴基斯坦民歌。
    下午，中巴两国艺术家们在十三陵水库边举行了联欢。东方歌舞团的文艺工作者们表演了巴基斯坦的《脚铃舞》。巴基斯坦艺术家们演奏了巴基斯坦的民乐，演唱了民歌。两国艺术家优美动人的歌舞，激起了全场不断的掌声。
