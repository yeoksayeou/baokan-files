    Bearing the Overall Situation in Mind

    The overall situation is composed of individual parts. In our work, we often encounter the relationship between the overall situation and the individual parts; how to resolve this kind of problem is a test for each individual part.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A communist must understand the principle of the part being subordinate to the whole. If a certain opinion seems feasible in the context of the part, but unfeasible in the context of the whole, the part should be subordinate to the whole. Conversely, if it seems unfeasible in the context of the part, but feasible in the context of the whole, the part should also be subordinate to the whole. This is the viewpoint of taking care of the overall situation."

    Producing new heavy rails, from the perspective of the large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, this "seems unfeasible" because it reduces the factory's production efficiency, increases production costs, and reduces revenue by 380,000 yuan per year. However, from the overall perspective, it "is feasible" because two new heavy rails can replace three old heavy rails, saving the state tens of millions of yuan in expenditures each year, and also saving the railway department a lot of expenses.

    What to do? The large rolling mill completely followed Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, resolutely implemented the "viewpoint of taking care of the overall situation," and happily accepted this production task that seemed unfeasible from a partial perspective. By doing so, they truly emphasized politics.

    Aren't we advocating embracing the motherland and having the world in view? The viewpoint of embracing the motherland and having the world in view is also the viewpoint of the overall situation. We revolutionaries must have in mind the overall situation of the Chinese revolution and the overall situation of the world revolution, consciously making the local interests of our own units, departments, and regions subordinate to the overall interests. This is what we mean by emphasizing politics.

    An enterprise must have its own economic accounting, strive to reduce costs, increase production, and accumulate as much capital as possible for the country. However, the enterprise's small accounting must be subordinate to the state's large accounting, and the enterprise's small account must be subordinate to the state's large account. The comrades of the large rolling mill understand this principle; for the sake of the overall interests, they consciously bear local losses. This is a revolutionary consciousness, a consciousness of emphasizing politics.

    Under normal circumstances, enterprises should strive to increase income, not decrease it. In special circumstances, enterprises should bear local losses. Exchanging the small losses of an enterprise for the large interests of the entire country, what could be more enjoyable for revolutionaries who embrace the motherland? Moreover, as long as we truly emphasize politics, this reasonable loss of subordinating to the overall situation will become the driving force for technological innovation and tapping potential. In this way, the loss will be temporary; before long, the loss will turn into no loss, or even into a large surplus.

    The example of the large rolling mill producing new heavy rails once again proves that socialist enterprises must emphasize politics.

### 胸怀全局

专栏：短评

    胸怀全局
    全局是由局部组成的。在我们的工作中，常常碰到全局和局部的关系问题；怎样解决这一类问题，是对每一个局部的考验。
    毛泽东同志说过：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。如果某项意见在局部的情形看来是可行的，而在全局的情形看来是不可行的，就应以局部服从全局。反之也是一样，在局部的情形看来是不可行的，而在全局的情形看来是可行的，也应以局部服从全局。这就是照顾全局的观点。”
    生产新型重轨，从鞍钢大型轧钢厂这个局部来看，似乎“是不可行的”，因为它使工厂的生产效率降低，生产成本增加，每年要减少收入三十八万元。但是，从全局来看，却“是可行的”，因为两根新型重轨可以顶三根旧型重轨用，国家每年可以节约几千万元的支出，铁道部门也将节约许多费用。
    怎么办？大型轧钢厂完全按照毛泽东同志的教导，坚决贯彻“照顾全局的观点”，愉快地接受了这个从局部来看是不可行的生产任务。他们这样做，真正突出了政治。
    我们不是提倡胸怀祖国、放眼世界吗？胸怀祖国、放眼世界的观点，也就是全局观点。我们革命者的心目中要有中国革命的全局，有世界革命的全局，自觉地使本单位、本部门、本地区的局部利益，服从全局利益。这就是我们所说的突出政治。
    一个企业要有自己的经济核算，要努力降低成本，增加生产，为国家积累尽可能多的资金。但是，企业的小核算要服从国家的大核算，企业的小账要服从国家的大账。大型轧钢厂的同志们懂得这个道理，他们为了全局的利益，自觉地承受局部的损失。这是一种革命的自觉，突出政治的自觉。
    在一般情况下，企业应当力争增加收入，而不应当减少收入。在特殊情况下，企业却应当承担局部的损失。以一个企业的小损失换取整个国家的大利益，对于胸怀祖国的革命者，何乐而不为呢？而且，只要真正突出政治，这种服从全局的合理损失，还会变成革新技术、挖掘潜力的动力，这样损失也就会是暂时的，不用多久，损失就会变为不损失，甚至变为大有盈余。
    大型轧钢厂生产新型重轨的事例，再一次证明，社会主义企业必须突出政治。
