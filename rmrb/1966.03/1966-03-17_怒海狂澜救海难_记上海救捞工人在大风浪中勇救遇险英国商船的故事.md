    Rescuing from Disaster Amidst Stormy Seas
    —A Story of Shanghai Salvage Workers Bravely Rescuing a Stranded British Merchant Ship in a Great Storm

            A Distress Call from the Yangtze River Estuary
    On the evening of February 22nd, a cold wave moved southward, the north wind howled, and the East Sea's waves towered.
    The Shanghai Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau received a distress telegram: the British ten-thousand-ton merchant ship "Hapag-Lloyd" was in distress on the Yangtze River estuary and requested emergency rescue.
    A battle to rescue from maritime disaster unfolded. The leaders of the Salvage Bureau immediately deployed for battle, issuing orders: the "Rescue No. 3," which was waiting outside Wusongkou, should proceed quickly to the scene; the "Rescue No. 1," which was waiting at the wharf, should prepare for rescue; the newly transferred "Production No. 2" should also immediately participate in the rescue work. At the same time, a rescue team organized by various trades was quickly formed.
    The rescue fleet set out under the leadership of bureau cadres; a pre-battle mobilization meeting was being held on board. Comrade Fan Lianfang, the Party Secretary, explained in detail to the crew the important significance of this rescue mission and analyzed the favorable factors and difficulties. Finally, he said: "The higher authorities have called on us to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of humanitarianism in rescuing the dying and helping the injured, to be unafraid of danger, and to do everything possible to save the distressed ship."

            Rescuers with Redoubled Courage
    The Party's call clarified the direction for the crew and boosted their morale. Each rescue team immediately launched heated discussions and solemnly swore to the Party and the people: We will resolutely complete the task!
    The divers of the diving team stated: No matter how strong the wind, how high the waves, or how harsh the climate, we must dive into the seabed to find out the situation and plug the holes;
    The mechanics of the mechanical team stated: Under any circumstances, we will stick to our posts and ensure that the machines are running and do not break down;
    The sailors of the sailor team stated: We will rush to wherever we are needed, ensuring that we keep up and cooperate well. …
    The rescue fleet was moving forward. Everyone had a common thought, a common belief: "Now is the time for us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way and learn from the thorough revolutionary spirit of Comrades Wang Jie and Jiao Yulu. We will use the solid rescue skills we have practiced at ordinary times today, coupled with the courage to be unafraid of hardship, unafraid of fatigue, and unafraid of death. Victory will surely belong to us!"
    The fleet sailed out to sea, braving the wind and waves. The sea was blowing at force eight. They were heading due east, but the wind was from the north-northwest, and waves were constantly splashing onto the deck from the ship's side. Sailing across the waves like this is a major nautical taboo. To avoid capsizing, the fleet adopted a zigzagging technique, advancing with difficulty. But the ship still swayed violently, and many crew members suffered from seasickness and vomiting, unable to stand. However, when they thought of the arduous task they were carrying, they braced themselves and stuck to their posts. The old helmsman Yan Wenbin felt an even greater responsibility at this critical moment. He held the helm tightly, watched ahead with his eyes, and stood firmly on the bridge, doing the work of two shifts by himself. Comrades saw that he was too tired and advised him to rest, but he firmly replied, "I am a Communist Party member and must withstand the wind and waves and hold the helm!"
    After a battle with the wind and waves, the fleet finally arrived at the scene of the Yangtze River estuary in time. The distressed "Hapag-Lloyd" was stopped on the northeast sea, the ship was dark, and it looked like the ship has sunk quite deep. The crew members were eager to try, wishing to go up and rescue immediately.

                Dangerous Approach
    However, in the strong wind and huge waves, how difficult it was to approach the ship. "Rescue No. 3" first moved forward, braving the waves, and forcibly approached the distressed ship. Seeing that it was about to approach, a huge wave pushed the ship back again. Circling to approach again, it was pushed back by the waves. After approaching several times, it still failed. "If the ship can't approach, how can we rescue?" Everyone was very anxious, so "Rescue No. 1" was dispatched to approach again, but it also failed. At this time, the distressed ship was also constantly sending signals to the fleet: "Approach me quickly!" "Approach me quickly!" The crew members understood from the signals that the merchant ship was in a critical state and was very likely to continue sinking.
    What to do? The command decided to use a small motorboat to forcibly approach, and immediately sent a reply signal to the distressed ship: "Approaching immediately!" "Approaching immediately!" In this surging sea, it was risky to approach a large ocean liner with a small motorboat. "Who should be assigned such a difficult and dangerous task?" The leaders of the fleet had to consider it carefully. Before the leaders could make a choice, the crew members came forward to volunteer one by one: "I'll go!" "Give me this task!" Finally, engineer Shen A'si, divers Shen Guixiang and Song Shoufu, boatswain Zhang Genfa, shipping section chief Liang Jiwen, technician Shen Qinsheng, dispatcher Wang Zunmin, and others were selected, led by leading cadre Yang Zhenlong, to board the boat and set off. Before leaving, Comrade Fan Lianfang, the Party Secretary, repeatedly urged them to pay attention to safety and to find out the situation first after boarding the ship. Chief Engineer Tan Jixiao replied, "I will definitely drive the small motorboat well and ensure that the comrades safely approach successfully." He immediately set off with the small motorboat.

          Conquering Wave Peaks, Climbing Ropes to Board
    There was no moon in the sky, the sea was pitch black, the wind was getting stronger, and the temperature dropped to minus five degrees. Waves crashed against the small boat advancing in the dark, and the crew members' clothes were soaked by the seawater, but everyone ignored these things and continued to move forward. Gradually, a huge black shadow appeared in front of everyone, and the small boat began to approach the giant ship. At this time, another wave hit, lifting the small boat to a wave peak several meters high, and then another wave pressed the small boat to a very low wave trough. The violent bumps made it impossible for the crew members to board the ship.
    At this time, boatswain Zhang Genfa suddenly saw a cable hanging on the side of the giant ship (this was a lifeline rope prepared by the British crew for escape). He was inspired and waited for another wave to lift the small boat up. He jumped up, grabbed the cable tightly, and climbed up quickly like climbing a cliff. Then divers Song Shoufu and Shen Guixiang also did the same. They quickly lowered the cable on the ship, tied the small boat tightly, and lowered a rope ladder to allow everyone to board the ship.

              The Cabin Water Level with the Sea
      The engine room of the "Hapag-Lloyd" had been completely flooded, the ship had stalled, there was no power, and it was pitch black. There was no one on the deck, no one in the rooms, and it was silent. The British sailors had all run to the bridge, each draped in a blanket, carrying valuables and life jackets, preparing to escape. The captain had also packed the nautical log, ship certificate, and crew handbook beside him, it seemed that they were preparing to abandon ship. Seeing our crew members boarding the ship, they gathered around and asked with worried faces, "We are in such a difficult situation now, what do you think we should do?" Comrade Liang Jiwen expressed his condolences to them and said, "You can rest assured that everyone's life safety is guaranteed. At the same time, we will do our best and take active rescue measures to get the distressed ship out of danger as soon as possible." Upon hearing this, the British sailors' emotions began to stabilize, but they revealed a skeptical look as to whether we could save the sunken ship.
    According to the British sailors, after the "Hapag-Lloyd" encountered the disaster, seawater entered the engine room from the stern, the water level inside the ship was level with the sea surface, and the ship had sunk two meters; if it was not rescued in time, the seawater would seep into the sealed cargo hold, and the ship might sink. It seemed that to save the ship, the engine room leaks had to be plugged first.

        Diving into the Engine Room to Explore Leaks and Close Valves
    Diver Shen Guixiang accepted this task. Diving into the engine room from the deck was like walking down a three-story building. The water in the engine room was very deep, with a thick layer of oil floating on the surface, and the underwater path was winding and curved, bumping into machines everywhere, and it was impossible to see anything, relying entirely on groping forward in the dark. It was possible that he could not climb back up after going down, or that the oxygen tube might get stuck and suffocate him. In short, it was difficult and dangerous to enter. However, Lao Shen did not hesitate. As soon as he received the task, he immediately dived into the engine room. After careful exploration, the leak was quickly found. It turned out that there was a hole at the bottom of the stern, and seawater poured into the rear cabin through the hole, and then rolled into the engine room. It just so happened that a safety valve connecting the engine room to the stern was not closed properly, and seawater poured in from here. Shen Guixiang used all his strength to withstand the pressure of the incoming water and closed the valve, cutting off the water source entering the engine room, taking only more than forty minutes in total.

            Overcoming Difficulties to Move Pumping Machines Onboard
    At the same time, a battle to transport rescue equipment was also underway. "Rescue No. 1" and "Production No. 2" continued to forcibly approach the ocean liner to transport rescue equipment. The crew members seized the favorable opportunity and approached at once. However, it was still very difficult to transport the pumping machine, water pipes, and other rescue equipment onto the ocean liner, because the engine room was flooded and there was no power, so the lifting equipment could not be used. At this time, the crew members thought of the heroic deeds of Wang Tieh-jen of the Daqing Oilfield, whom they had just studied. In order to drill wells and produce oil as soon as possible, Wang Tieh-jen was able to use manpower to move the huge drilling rig step by step from the station to the construction site. Why couldn't we use manpower to move the equipment onto the distressed ship! Revolutionary examples generate great power. The crew members first tied the pumping machine firmly, lifted it to the ship's side, and waited for a wave to lift the ship up. With a shout, the crew members on the ocean liner caught it, worked together, overcame the difficulties, and managed to pull the tons of pumping machine up with manpower.

          Fighting Bravely on the Seabed
    At the same time, a tense battle to plug leaks and patch holes was also underway. Divers Song Shoufu and Shen Guixiang continued to dive, going deep into the bottom of the ship to investigate the situation. The two of them went down from the left and right sides, but they were lifted to the surface by the waves several times because the waves were too big. They decided to take a forced dive. The crew members fastened a circle of ropes around the entire stern, and the divers clung tightly to the ropes, diving step by step along the ship's side. The "Hapag-Lloyd" was very deep, and the divers had to take great risks to find the holes at the bottom of the ship. If the wind and waves overturned the ship, the hull would press down on the divers, possibly crushing them to pieces. But Lao Shen and Xiao Song thought of the selfless revolutionary spirit of Wang Jie and Jiao Yulu and dived into the bottom of the ship without hesitation. Engineer Shen A'si, who was directing the diving on the ship, talked to them many times, telling them to come up quickly if they encountered any difficulties. But the microphone transmitted a firm reply: "We must find the hole before coming up!"
    Was this too risky? No, our divers had their own methods. They held tightly to the ropes on the side of the ship with one hand, kept their bodies close to the side of the ship, and reached out to the bottom of the ship to explore, thus step by step finding out the size and location of the broken holes at the bottom of the ship, and quickly making marks to prepare for the plugging work.
    A waterproof mat was used to plug the leaks. This was an extra-large piece of canvas with blankets and cotton wadding on it. The people on the ship pulled it tight with ropes, and the divers scooped the "mat" from the seabed to the broken hole. Using the strong suction force of the water flowing into the hole, they were able to hold the "mat" tightly, and then they tied the "mat" firmly with steel cables to plug the hole. This dangerous rescue project and the tenacious and brave heroic actions of the Chinese sailors surprised, delighted, and admired the British sailors on the ship, and they constantly praised, "This is really done at the risk of life, it's really amazing!"

            The Ship Rises! The Ship Rises!
    The leaks were finally plugged, and the seawater no longer poured into the cabin; a pumping battle was also being carried out urgently. At this time, it was pitch black on the ship, and machine installation and other work had to be done in the dark. The crew members quickly installed the pumping machine with the night-fighting skills they had practiced in peacetime and quickly started it. "Whirr whirr whirr", the water in the engine room began to be pumped out, and the water level gradually dropped. The British sailors' faces also changed with the slow rise of the ship. The originally skeptical look turned into a smile; some whistled the first whistle after the disaster; some happily sang; some turned on the radio; some measured the water level and quickly ran over excitedly to report: "The ship has risen!" "The ship has risen!" Some even gave our crew members a thumbs up from time to time, expressing their admiration.
    The pumping machine pumped the water out of the cabin day and night, and the water in the cabin became less and less, and the ship slowly floated up. By the evening of February 24th, the "Hapag-Lloyd" had floated to near its normal draft depth. Our rescuers estimated that it could pass through the Tongsha sea surface shoal, so they decided to use a tugboat to tow the ocean liner into Shanghai Port so that it could completely escape the danger.

          The Revolutionary Courage of Chinese Workers
            Saved People, Saved Ships, Saved Goods
    That night at 9 p.m. the ocean liner was finally towed into port smoothly and berthed at the Minsheng Road Wharf.
    When the representative of our Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau bid farewell to the British captain and asked him for his opinion on this rescue, the captain said with emotion: "Thank you for your rescue." The crew members also reflected, "The Chinese crew members worked efficiently, quickly, bravely, and competently. If we encountered such a thing, we wouldn't do it like you."
    Yes, heroic salvage workers, after three days and three nights of arduous struggle, you not only saved people, saved ships, and saved a ship full of grain, but more importantly, you won honor for the motherland with your actions, demonstrating the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of the Chinese people; your victory once again proves that the Chinese salvage workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are brave and tenacious and can withstand the test of great wind and waves!

    怒海狂澜救海难
    ——记上海救捞工人在大风浪中勇救遇险英国商船的故事
            长江口海面来的求救电
    二月二十二日傍晚，寒流南下，北风呼啸，东海巨浪滔天。
    上海海难救助打捞局接到了一个求救电报：英国万吨商船“哈巴古斯号”在长江口海面上失事，请求紧急抢救。
    一场抢救海难的战斗展开了。打捞局领导立即部署战斗，下达命令：正在吴淞口外待命的“救捞三号轮”，迅速开赴现场；正在码头上待命的“救捞一号轮”，做好抢救准备；刚调来的“生产二号轮”，也立即参加抢救工作。与此同时，一支由各工种组织的抢救队伍也很快组成。
    救助船队在局领导干部带领下出发了；一个战前的动员会正在船上召开。党委书记范连芳同志向船员详细说明了这次抢救任务的重要意义，并分析了有利因素和困难，最后说：“上级号召我们，要发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，临危不惧，要想尽一切办法把难船救起。”
            救助人员勇气百倍
    党的号召使船员们明确了方向，鼓舞了士气，各抢救小组立即热烈展开讨论，向党、向人民庄严宣誓：坚决完成任务！
    潜水组的潜水员们表示：风再大，浪再高，气候再恶劣，也一定要潜入海底把失事情况摸清，堵住破洞；
    机务组的机工们表示：在任何情况下，坚守工作岗位，保证机器开得动，不发生故障；
    水手组的水手们表示：那里需要就奔向那里，保证跟得紧，配合得好。……
    救助船队在前进，全体人员有一个共同的想法，一个共同的信念：“现在正是我们活学活用毛主席著作，学习王杰、焦裕禄同志的彻底革命精神的时候，我们把平时练就的救捞过硬本领在今天使出来，再加上不怕苦，不怕累，不怕死的勇气，胜利一定属于我们！”
    船队乘风破浪出海了。海面正刮着八级大风。他们航向正东，风向却是北偏西北，海浪不断从船舷扑上甲板。这样横在海浪里行驶，是航海大忌。为了免于倾覆，船队采用锯齿形的技巧航行，艰难地前进着。但船身还是大摇大摆，许多船员都晕浪呕吐，站立不住。然而，当他们一想到自己身上担负着艰巨的任务时，振作精神，坚守着自己的岗位。老舵工严文彬，在这紧急关头，更感自己身上的重大责任，他紧紧把稳船舵，两眼注视前方，屹立在驾驶台上，一人顶了二班活。同志们看他太累了，劝他休息，他坚决地回答说：“我是共产党员，要顶得住风浪掌得住舵！”
    经过一场和风浪的搏斗，船队终于及时赶到了长江口现场。失事的“哈巴古斯号”停在东北海面上，船上一片漆黑，看上去吃水已经很深。船员们磨拳擦掌，恨不得立即上去抢救。
                冒　险　强　靠
    然而，在大风巨浪里，要把船靠上去，是何等艰难呵。“救捞三号”首先破浪前进，强行向遇难船靠拢。眼看快要靠上了，一个巨浪又把船打了回来。兜个圈子再靠，又被浪头击回，靠了好几次都没有靠上。“船靠不上，怎么施救？”大家心中很急，于是派出“救捞一号”船再靠，也没靠上。此时，遇难船上也不时向船队打来讯号：“快向我靠拢！”“快向我靠拢！”船员们从讯号中明白，这艘商船已处在危急状态中，很有可能继续下沉。
    怎么办？指挥部决定改用小汽艇强靠，随即向遇难船打出回答讯号：“马上靠拢！”“马上靠拢！”在这汹涌澎湃的海浪里，要把小汽艇靠上大海轮，非冒险不可。“让谁去担当这样艰险的任务呢？”船队领导不能不作郑重考虑。没等领导作出选择，船员们一个个来到面前请战了：“我去！”“把这任务交给我！”最后选定工程师沈阿四，潜水员沈桂祥、宋寿富，水手长张根发，船务科长梁吉文，技术员沈钦胜，调度员王尊敏等八人，由领导干部杨振龙带领登艇出发。临行前，党委书记范连芳同志再三叮嘱他们要注意安全，上船后要先摸清情况。轮机长谭继校回答说：“我一定把小汽艇开好，让同志们安全地抢靠成功。”说着开着小汽艇立即出发了。
          征服浪峰　攀缆登船
    天空没有月亮，漆黑漆黑的海上，风越来越大，气温下降到零下五度。一个个浪头袭击着摸黑前进的小艇，船员们的衣服被海水溅得湿透，但大家根本不理会这些，继续前进。渐渐地一个巨大的黑影出现在大家面前，小艇开始向巨轮靠拢了。这时又一个浪头打来，把小艇抬上几米高的浪峰，接着，另一个浪头却又把小艇压到很低很低的浪谷。剧烈的颠簸，使船员们无法登上船去。
    这时水手长张根发忽然看到巨轮船舷上悬着一条缆绳（这是英国船员准备逃生的救生绳），他急中生智，再等一个浪头把小艇抬高时，就纵身一跃，紧紧抓住缆绳，象攀登悬崖那样，迅速攀上去。接着潜水员宋寿富、沈桂祥也照此办理。他们在船上很快放下缆绳，把小艇紧紧牵牢，又放下软梯，让大家登船。
              船舱积水与海面相平
      “哈巴古斯号”机舱已经全部进水，船已熄火，动力全无，一片漆黑。甲板上没有人，房间里也没有人，鸦雀无声。英国海员们都已跑到驾驶台上去了，每人披着一条毛毯，带着细软和救生衣，准备逃生。船长也已把航海日记、船舶证明书和船员手册收拾在身边，看来，他们准备弃船了。看见了我们的船员上了船，他们都围拢来，满脸愁容地问：“我们现在这样困难，你们看怎么办？”梁吉文同志对他们表示了慰问，并说：“你们可以放心，大家的生命安全是有保障的。同时，我们将尽最大努力，采取积极抢救措施，使难船早日脱险。”英国海员们一听这话，情绪开始稳定下来；但，对我们能不能救起沉船，却流露出将信将疑的神色。
    据英国海员介绍，“哈巴古斯号”遇难后，海水由船尾进入机舱，船内积水已和海面相平，船身已下沉了二米；如果不及时抢救，海水渗入密封的货舱，船就有沉没的可能。看来，要救船首先要堵住机舱漏洞。
        潜水下机舱探索漏洞关好闸门
    潜水员沈桂祥接受了这个任务。从甲板潜进机舱，相当于走下一座三层楼。机舱里积水很深，水面上浮着厚厚一层油污，水下路径弯弯曲曲，碰来碰去都是机器，而且伸手不见五指，完全要靠双手摸黑前进，有可能下去了爬不上来；有可能氧气管被卡住而闷死。总之，要进去是艰难而危险的。然而，老沈毫不踌躇，一接任务，立即迅速地潜下机舱。经过细细探索，漏洞很快找到了。原来，船尾底部有个破洞，海水随洞涌进后舱后，便滚滚向机舱闯来，恰巧机舱通向船尾的一个安全闸门没有关好，海水便从这里闯了进来。沈桂祥用尽全身力气，顶住涌来的水流压力，把闸门关好，切断机舱进水水源，前后只花四十多分钟。
            克服困难搬上抽水机器
    在此同时，一场抢运救助器材的战斗也在进行。“救捞一号”、“生产二号”，继续强行向海轮靠拢，以便运送救助器材。船员们看准有利时机，一下子靠了上去。但是，要把船上的抽水机、水管等救助器材运上海轮，还是十分艰难，因为机舱进水后没有动力，起重设备不能利用。这时船员们想到了刚刚学习过的大庆油田王铁人的英雄事迹。为了早日打井出油，王铁人能用人力把巨大的钻机一步步从车站搬到工地，我们为什么不能用人力把设备搬上难船！革命的榜样产生巨大的力量。船员们先把抽水机捆得结结实实，抬上船舷，待一个浪头打来，把船抬高时，一声呼喊，海轮上的船员就把它接住，齐心协力，克服了困难，硬是用人力把上吨重的抽水机拉了上去。
          奋勇战斗在海底
    在此同时，一场堵漏补洞的紧张战斗也展开了。潜水员宋寿富、沈桂祥继续下水，深入船底摸情况。他们两人一个从左边下去，一个从右边下去，但由于海浪太大，几次都被浪头抬上海面。他们决定采取强行下潜。船员们在整个船尾上箍起一圈绳索，潜水员就紧紧攀着绳索，沿着船艕，一步步下潜。“哈巴古斯号”吃水很深，潜水员在船底摸洞，得冒很大的危险，万一风浪一掀，船身将向潜水员压来，说不定就此粉身碎骨。但是老沈和小宋想到王杰、焦裕禄他们忘我革命精神，毫不犹豫，潜入了船底。在船上指挥潜水的工程师沈阿四多次和他们通话，告诉他们，如果有困难就赶紧上来。可是话筒里却传来坚决的回答：“一定要把洞摸到了再上来！”
    这样做是不是太冒险了呢？不，我们的潜水员自有办法。他们一手紧紧攀住船舷上的绳索，把身体紧贴在船边，用手伸向船底探索，这样才一步一步摸清船底坏洞的大小和部位，迅速做好记号，为堵漏工作做好准备。
    堵漏采用了一种防水席。这是一块特大的帆布，上面放着毛毯和棉絮，船上的人用绳索把它拉紧，潜水员就把“席子”从海底兜向破洞。利用洞口那一股强大水吸力，能把“席子”紧紧吸住时，他们就用钢索把“席子”绑牢，把破洞堵住。这种艰险的抢救工程，和中国海员顽强勇敢的英雄行为，使船上的英国海员又惊，又喜，又钦佩，不断称赞说：“这真是冒了生命危险干的，真是了不起！”
            船上升了！船上升了！
    漏洞终于被堵住，海水不再闯进船舱了；一场抽水战斗也在紧急进行。这时，船上一片漆黑，机器安装等工作都要摸黑进行。船员们凭着平日练就的一身夜战硬功夫，很快把抽水机安装好，迅速开动。“哗哗哗”，机舱里的水开始被抽出来，积水逐渐下降了。英国海员的脸色随着船身的慢慢上升，也改变了。原来将信将疑的神色变了笑容；有的人吹起遇难后第一声口哨；有的高兴地唱起歌来；有的打开了半导体收音机；有的量了量水呎，赶紧兴奋地跑来告诉说：“船上升了！”“船上升了！”有人还不时向我们的船员翘起大拇指，表示佩服。
    抽水机日夜不停地把舱里的水往外抽，舱内积水越来越少，船也就慢慢的浮升起来。到二月二十四日傍晚，“哈巴古斯号”已经浮升到接近正常吃水深度。我们的救助人员估计它可以通过铜沙海面浅滩，就决定用拖轮把海轮拖进上海港，使它完全脱离险境。
          中国工人的革命勇敢精神
            救了人救了船救了货
    这天晚上九点多钟，海轮终于被顺利地拖进港，泊靠到民生路码头。
    当我海难救助打捞局代表向英国船长告别，征求他对这次抢救有何意见时，船长感动地说：“感谢你们的抢救。”船员也反映说：“中国船员干活效率高，速度快，勇敢能干，要是我们遇到这样的事，不会象你们那样干的。”
    是的，英勇的救捞工人们，你们经过三天三夜的艰苦奋战，不但救了人，救了船，救了满船的粮食，而更重要的是，你们用行动为祖国争得了荣誉，表现了中国人民的革命人道主义精神；你们的胜利再次证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国救捞工人是勇敢顽强的，是经受得住大风大浪考验的！
