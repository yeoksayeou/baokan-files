    Liaoning Manufactures Large, High-Efficiency Vacuum Pump
    Creates more favorable conditions for further development of vacuum metallurgy technology and improvement of steel quality
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) A large Roots vacuum pump has been successfully trial-produced at the Liaoning Provincial Vacuum Technology Research Institute.
    Vacuum plays a very important role in modern science and technology. Vacuum methods can be used to refine metal materials with excellent properties and extremely high purity that cannot be refined in the atmosphere. Vacuum treatment of molten steel can eliminate various impurities caused by atmospheric pollution to a certain extent.
    The newly manufactured large Roots vacuum pump has a pumping capacity four times greater than the current domestic small Roots vacuum pumps. Its main characteristics are fast start-up and high efficiency. Ordinary vacuum pumps, such as booster pumps and oil diffusion pumps, take one to four hours to reach their ultimate vacuum, while this pump only takes seven minutes to reach its ultimate vacuum. Using this pump to replace mechanical pumps as vacuum treatment equipment for molten steel can save a lot of investment and installation land. Its birth has created more favorable conditions for China to further develop vacuum metallurgy technology and improve steel quality.

    辽宁制成大型高效率真空泵
    为进一步发展真空冶炼技术、提高钢的质量创造了更有利条件
    据新华社沈阳电　大型罗茨真空泵已在辽宁省真空技术研究所试制成功。
    真空在现代科学技术中，有着非常重要的用途。用真空的方法，可以炼出在大气中炼不出的性能优异而纯度极高的金属材料。钢水经过真空处理，可以在一定程度上消除由于大气污染带来的各种杂质。
    新制成的这种大型罗茨真空泵，抽气能力比目前国产的小型罗茨真空泵大四倍。它的主要特点是起动快，效率高，一般真空泵如增压泵、油扩散泵要达到极限真空度，需要一到四个小时，而这种泵达到极限真空度只要七分钟就可以了。用这种泵代替机械泵作为钢水的真空处理设备，可以节省大量投资和安装用地。它的诞生，为我国进一步发展真空冶炼技术、提高钢的质量创造了更有利条件。
