    The tide of struggle of the American people against the Johnson administration's war of aggression against Vietnam is sweeping across the entire United States with unprecedented scale and momentum in history. This shows that the American people stand with the Vietnamese people, not with their own imperialist government.
    The reason why the broad masses of the American people are in complete opposition to the American government on the Vietnam issue is because the Johnson government is waging an unjust war of aggression. Such a war not only harms the interests of the Vietnamese people, but also harms the interests of the American people. The war of aggression against Vietnam is bringing increasingly huge sacrifices and disasters to the American people. From a report in the *Wall Street Journal* about Dodge City, one can see how much the American war of aggression has affected the lives of the American people. American anti-war demonstrators questioned Johnson: "How many more young men did you kill today?" This means that they understand that Johnson's hands are not only stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, but also with the blood of the American people.
    There are inherent and irreconcilable contradictions between the American ruling class and the broad masses of the American people. Because the American ruling group launched a war of aggression that violated the interests of the American people, this contradiction has become more acute. The war of aggression against Vietnam has caused suffering to the American people and has also educated the American people. In today's America, more and more people are gradually recognizing the anti-people essence of the American ruling group through vivid reality, thereby greatly improving their political consciousness. The American people have combined the struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam with the struggle to improve their lives, guarantee democratic rights, oppose racial discrimination, and change the social status quo. This marks an unprecedented awakening of the American people, and a great revolutionary storm is brewing in the United States. If the Johnson government stubbornly continues to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the result can only be to accelerate the arrival of the American revolutionary storm.

    侵越战争唤醒了美国人民
    美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵略越南战争的斗争浪潮，正在以历史上空前未有的规模和声势，席卷整个美国。这表明，美国人民是同越南人民站在一起，而不是同本国的帝国主义政府站在一起。
    美国广大人民所以在越南问题上同美国政府处于完全对立的地位，是因为约翰逊政府在进行的是一场非正义的侵略战争。这样一场战争，不仅损害越南人民的利益，而且也损害美国人民的利益。侵越战争正在给美国人民带来日益巨大的牺牲和灾难。从《华尔街日报》一篇关于美国道奇城的报道，就可以看到，美国的侵略战争已经对美国人民的生活产生多么巨大的影响。美国反侵越战争示威群众质问约翰逊：“今天你又杀死几个小伙子？”这就是说，他们明白，约翰逊的手上，不仅沾满越南人民的鲜血，而且也沾满美国人民的鲜血。
    美国统治阶级和美国广大人民之间，本来就存在着不可调和的矛盾。由于美国统治集团发动违反美国人民利益的侵略战争，这种矛盾就更加尖锐化了。侵越战争使美国人民遭受了苦难，同时也教育了美国人民。在今天的美国，越来越多的人就是通过活生生的现实，逐渐认识到美国统治集团的反人民的本质，从而大大地提高了政治觉悟的。美国人民已经把反对侵越战争的斗争，同要求改善生活、保障民主权利、反对种族歧视、改变社会现状的斗争结合起来。这标志着美国人民的空前觉醒，在美国正酝酿着一个伟大的革命风暴。约翰逊政府一意孤行地继续沿着扩大侵越战争道路走下去，结果只能加速美国革命风暴的来到。
