    Beijing No. 2 Pesticide Factory is producing a new type of plant growth regulator that only appeared in the 1960s - Daomai Li.
    This regulator can inhibit cotton overgrowth, prevent wheat lodging, and ensure higher yields of cotton and wheat. It is also effective in drought resistance, alkali resistance, and promoting phased ripening of fruits and vegetables.
    In cotton fields with sufficient water and fertilizer, cotton plants often grow too vigorously, with stems and leaves growing tall and large, shading each other, causing a large number of buds and bolls to fall off from the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants. According to experiments conducted by the cotton planting science and technology team composed of commune members and agricultural scientific workers from seven counties in the suburbs of Beijing, the use of Daomai Li can effectively prevent the shedding of buds and bolls. After they used some Daomai Li in the cotton fields, it effectively prevented the overgrowth of cotton plants, improved ventilation and light transmission conditions in the fields, significantly reduced the shedding of buds and bolls, and resulted in uniform boll setting. Compared with cotton fields where Daomai Li was not applied, the cotton yield per unit area increased by 10% to 40%. Daomai Li also played a role in chemical pruning on cotton plants, which not only saved labor for pruning but also facilitated appropriate increases in planting density, giving better play to the potential for increased production.
    The Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences, in high-yield wheat fields with sufficient water and fertilizer, after treating wheat seedlings with Daomai Li during the wheat jointing stage, found that the wheat grew with thick and short stems, large ears, and many grains, effectively preventing excessive wheat growth and lodging, achieving a good effect of increasing production by 17% to 22%.

    北京制成植物生长调节剂
    能抑制棉花徒长，能防止小麦倒伏
    北京农药二厂正在生产一种六十年代才出现的新型植物生长调节剂——稻麦立。
    这种调节剂能抑制棉花徒长，防止小麦倒伏，保证棉花和小麦获得较高的产量。它在抗旱、抗盐碱和促进果蔬分期成熟方面也有效果。
    在水肥充足的棉田里，棉株常常生长过旺，茎和叶长得又高又大，互相遮阴，造成棉株中下部蕾铃大量脱落。据北京郊区七个县的公社社员和农业科学工作者组成的植棉科学技术小组试验证明，使用稻麦立之后，就可以有效地防止蕾铃脱落。他们在棉田里使用了一些稻麦立，便有效地防止了棉株徒长，田间通风透光条件得到改善，蕾铃脱落显著减少，结桃均匀。同未施用稻麦立的棉田比较，棉花单位面积产量提高百分之十到百分之四十。稻麦立在棉株上还起到了化学整枝的作用，不仅节省了整枝的人工，还便于适当增加种植密度，更好地发挥增产潜力。
    中国科学院植物研究所和北京市农业科学研究所，在水肥充足的高产麦田里，在小麦起身期，用稻麦立处理麦苗以后，小麦长得茎秆粗矮，穗大粒多，有效地防止了麦苗旺长和倒伏现象，获得了增产百分之十七到百分之二十二的良好效果。  （据新华社讯）
