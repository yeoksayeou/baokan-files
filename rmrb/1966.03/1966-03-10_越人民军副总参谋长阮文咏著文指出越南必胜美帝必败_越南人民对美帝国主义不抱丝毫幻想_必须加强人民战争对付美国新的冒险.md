    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th. The February issue of the Vietnamese magazine "Hoc Tap" (Study) published an article written by Nguyen Van Vinh, Director of the Vietnam Unification Committee and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Vietnam People's Army, entitled "No Force Can Stop the Vietnamese People from Advancing Along the Road to Victory," discussing that the anti-American national salvation struggle of the people in South and North Vietnam will surely win, and the US imperialist aggressors will surely be defeated.

    The article pointed out that the "special warfare" waged by US imperialism in South Vietnam has already failed. In 1965, the US aggressors sent more American troops to South Vietnam in an attempt to save the collapse of the puppet army and puppet regime and seize the initiative, and used the air force to intensify the war against the North, while also releasing a smokescreen of "peace negotiations." They thought that by doing so, they would soon force the military and civilians of South and North Vietnam to sign a ceasefire agreement that they had written in advance. However, the facts did not develop according to the despicable intentions of the US imperialists: the military and civilians in the South have achieved great victories in all aspects. The US aggressor troops have neither fulfilled their political task of preventing the collapse of the puppet army and puppet regime, nor have they themselves suffered heavy military defeats.

    The article pointed out that although US imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it is still unwilling to give up its conspiracy to invade South Vietnam. Soon they may send more troops, so that the US and vassal troops in South Vietnam may increase to about 300,000 or more. But under any circumstances, the military and civilians of the whole of Vietnam will defeat the American aggressor bandits.

    The article said, "We have had a year of practice in defeating US imperialism. Now it is very clear that there is sufficient practice to prove that we will inevitably defeat any type of war by US imperialism. We have had nearly a year of very vivid practice in defeating US imperialism's infantry and other arms and services in South Vietnam, as well as defeating US imperialism's destructive war against the North with its air force."

    The article emphasized, "Our people will surely win because we have absolute political and spiritual superiority, correct leadership lines, the strength of national unity, an invincible people's war, and the warm sympathy and support of the people of the world. As for US imperialism, no matter how stubborn and ferocious it is, it will surely fail."

    The article pointed out that US imperialism's large-scale troop increase in South Vietnam cannot change the balance of power to turn their defeat into victory. The practice in South Vietnam over the past year has clearly confirmed this: despite the large-scale US troop increase in the South, the balance of power between the US-puppet clique and the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces has not changed; if the balance of power has changed in some respects, it has only changed in favor of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, not in favor of US imperialism.

    The article pointed out that US imperialism is waging an unjust war of aggression and cannot get the support of the American people and the people of the world. The location of this war is tens of thousands of miles away from the United States. US imperialism also has to deal with many regions in the world at the same time, so it can only mobilize part of its forces to invest in the Vietnam battlefield. However, because the Vietnamese people are waging a just war, a war of self-defense on their own territory, they not only have various armed forces, but also have millions of patriotic people participating in the killing of the enemy in various forms. Our armed forces, including the main force, local forces and guerrillas, have an absolute advantage over the enemy in terms of both quantity and quality.

    The article said that because the war we are waging is just, because our military and civilians have absolute spiritual superiority, and because we have three types of troops, we can rely on the inexhaustible source of manpower from the masses to quickly replenish and develop our various revolutionary armed forces. Our armed forces not only know how to use various new weapons, but also are good at using simple weapons to carry out self-defense battles in villages and kill a large number of enemies. It is precisely on this basis that the invincible people's war waged by our people in the South makes it impossible for the enemy to withstand it.

    The article pointed out that US imperialism and the traitorous running dogs can never "pacify" their rear areas or control the people in the areas they rule. This is another factor in their inevitable defeat and the inevitable victory of the military and civilians in the South. The article said that in the past war of resistance against France, especially in today's South Vietnam, in many areas, although the enemy has a large army and has adopted countless barbaric methods to suppress the people, they still cannot find a place to stand. During the implementation of the Staley-Taylor plan and the McNamara-Lodge-Taylor "key pacification" plan to "pacify" the South, they sometimes used an entire division to carry out "pacification" in one or two counties and two or three townships at the gates of Saigon-Cholon for one or two years. But they all failed. The guerrillas and liberation armies in Saigon-Cholon and other places not only operate around the cities that serve as the enemy's throat, but also unexpectedly give the enemy thunderous blows in the enemy's city center or fortified bases. Obviously, the enemy cannot freely draw manpower and material resources in the areas they control, and they cannot even sleep peacefully in their offices, barracks and dormitories.

    The article said that the reason for this situation is first of all because the people in the South have a high degree of political consciousness, a strong patriotic heart, a high degree of hatred for the enemy, are willing to sacrifice, are not afraid of hardship, and are not deceived by the enemy. As the offspring of the patriotic movement in the South, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have a thorough understanding of the enemy and are constantly protected by the people.

    The article used a large number of facts to show that the more American troops enter South Vietnam, the more they are annihilated. The "superior" equipment of the US imperialists' sea, land and air forces is completely powerless in the face of the power of the people's war in South Vietnam. After a large number of American troops entered South Vietnam, the puppet army continued to be annihilated in large numbers. In 1965 alone, one-third of the total number of puppet infantry battalions were annihilated.

    The article pointed out that recently US imperialism has still greatly strengthened its war efforts in order to hold on to the South and destroy the North. Therefore, the war on both sides will become more intense.

    The article emphasized, "If it is said that US imperialism is increasing its war of aggression against our country by two or three times, on our part we must strengthen the sacred resistance in the South and the North ten times. We recognize the essence and conspiracy of the enemy, and we will not have the slightest illusion about them."

    The article said, "We are ready at any time to endure all hardships and sacrifices, and face any destruction by the enemy without wavering. We will spare no effort to support the heroic struggle of our compatriots in the South at any time, in order to defeat the American aggressors and their running dogs, liberate the South, defend the North, and then unify the motherland."

    The article concluded, "We are waging a world-shaking patriotic war. The revolution we are carrying out is an epitome of the current world revolution: liberating the nation, building and defending the socialist system, making practical contributions to safeguarding world peace, and promoting the revolutionary cause of the people of the world to move forward. We are taking up arms to strike at the most ferocious enemy of mankind—US imperialism. Glory belongs to our people. Final victory will surely belong to us."

    越人民军副总参谋长阮文咏著文指出越南必胜美帝必败
    越南人民对美帝国主义不抱丝毫幻想  必须加强人民战争对付美国新的冒险
    新华社河内八日电  越南《学习》杂志二月号刊载越南统一委员会主任、越南人民军副总参谋长阮文咏写的一篇题为《没有任何力量能够阻挡越南人民沿着胜利的道路前进》的文章，论述越南南方和北方人民的抗美救国斗争必胜，美帝国主义侵略者必败。
    文章指出，美帝国主义在越南南方打的“特种战争”已经失败。美国侵略者在一九六五年增派美军到越南南方，妄图挽救伪军和伪政权的崩溃和夺取主动权，并且使用空军加强对北方的战争，还放出“和平谈判”的烟幕。他们以为这样做，不久就会迫使越南南方和北方军民在他们事先写好的停战协定上签字。然而事实完全不是按照美帝国主义者的卑鄙意图发展的：南方军民已在各方面取得了巨大胜利。美国侵略军既不能实现其阻止伪军和伪政权崩溃的政治任务，而且连它自己也在军事上遭到了惨重失败。
      文章指出，美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨重失败，但仍然不肯放弃侵略越南南方的阴谋。不久它们可能增派更多的军队，使在越南南方的美军和仆从军可能增加到三十万左右或者更多一些。但不论在任何情况下，越南全国军民都必将战胜美国侵略强盗。
    文章说，“我们已有了一年的打败美帝国主义的实践。现在就很清楚，已有足够的实践证明我们必然战胜美帝国主义任何类型的战争。我们有了近一年战胜美帝国主义在越南南方的步兵和其他各兵种、军种，以及战胜美帝国主义以空军对北方进行破坏性战争的非常生动的实践。”
    文章强调说，“我国人民必胜，是因为我们有着政治和精神上的绝对优势，有着正确的领导路线，有着全民团结的力量，有着无敌的人民战争，有着全世界人民的热烈同情和支持。至于美帝国主义，不管它如何顽固和凶恶，也必定失败。”
    文章指出，美帝国主义大规模增兵南越，也绝不能改变力量对比来使它们转败为胜。越南南方一年来的实践，十分明显地证实了这点：尽管美国大规模向南方增兵，美伪集团和南方解放武装力量之间的力量对比，仍然没有改变；如果力量对比情况在某些方面有了改变，那也只是向有利于越南南方民族解放阵线方面的改变，而不是向有利于美帝国主义方面的改变。
    文章指出，美帝国主义进行的是一场非正义的侵略战争，不能得到美国人民和世界人民的支持。这场战争的地点远离美国万里。美帝国主义还要同时应付世界许多地区，因此，它只能调动其一部分力量投入越南战场。而越南人民由于进行的是正义战争，是在本国领土上进行的自卫战争，因此他们不但拥有各个武装力量，而且还拥有千百万爱国人民通过各种形式来参加杀敌。我们的武装力量，包括有主力部队、地方部队和游击队，这个武装力量在数量和质量上都比敌人占绝对优势。
    文章说，由于我们进行的战争是正义的，由于我国军民在精神上占绝对优势，由于我们拥有三种军队，因此，我们可以依靠人民群众这一无穷无尽的人力源泉，迅速地补充和发展我们的各个革命武装力量。我们的各支武装力量，既懂得使用各种新式武器，又善于运用简陋的武器，在村庄里进行自卫战斗，杀伤大量敌人。正是在这个基础上，我们南方人民进行的无敌的人民战争，使敌人不可能顶得住。
    文章指出，美帝国主义和卖国走狗怎样也“绥靖”不了它们的后方，控制不了它们统治地区的人民。这是它们必败，南方军民必胜的另一个因素。文章说，在过去抗法战争中，特别是在今天的越南南方，在许多地区，尽管敌人拥有一支庞大的军队、尽管它们采取了无数的野蛮手段来镇压人民，它们仍然找不到一个站稳脚跟的地方。在实施“绥靖”南方的斯特利—泰勒计划和麦克纳马拉—洛奇—泰勒的“重点绥靖”计划期间，它们有时用一个整师，在一两年内对西贡—堤岸大门口的一两个县、两三个乡进行“绥靖”。但是它们都遭到了失败。西贡—堤岸和其他地方的游击队和解放军，不单是只在作为敌人咽喉的城市四周活动，而且还神出鬼没地在敌人的城市中心或固守的基地给敌人以霹雳般的打击。显然，敌人是无法在它们控制的地区自由吸取人力物力的，甚至在办公室、营房和宿舍里，他们也是寝食不安的。
    文章说，所以出现有这种形势，首先是因为南方人民具有高度的政治觉悟，有浓厚的爱国心，高度地仇恨敌人，不惜牺牲，不怕艰苦，不受敌人的欺骗。作为南方爱国运动的产儿的南方解放武装力量，对敌人认识得很透，并时刻得到人民的掩护。
    文章用大量事实说明，美军开进南越愈多，被歼灭得愈多。美帝国主义的海陆空
  “优势”装备，在南越人民战争的威力面前根本无能为力。在美军大量开进南越以后，伪军继续被大量歼灭。仅一九六五年，伪军步兵营总数中已有三分之一被歼灭。
    文章指出，最近美帝国主义仍然大大加强战争努力，以便死死抓住南方，破坏北方。因此，两方的战争将更加激烈化。
    文章强调说，“如果说美帝国主义对我国正在增加两、三倍的侵略战争的努力，在我们这方面就必须十倍地加强南方和北方的神圣抗战。我们认清了敌人的本质和阴谋，对它们就不会有丝毫幻想。”
    文章说，“我们随时准备忍受一切艰苦牺牲，面对着敌人的任何破坏毫不动摇。我们不惜一切随时地支持我们南方同胞的英勇斗争，以打败美国侵略者及其走狗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。”
    文章最后说，“我们正进行着一场翻天覆地的爱国战争。我们进行的革命是当前世界革命的缩影：解放民族，建设和保卫社会主义制度，切实为保卫世界和平作出贡献，推动世界人民的革命事业向前发展。我们正拿起武器打击人类最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。光荣属于我国人民。最后胜利必将属于我们。”
