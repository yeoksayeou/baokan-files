    HANOI, March 24 (Xinhua) – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of the Central Trung Bo region of South Vietnam recently issued a communiqué stating that the army and people of Binh Dinh Province have thoroughly shattered the so-called "Operation Masher" (later renamed Operation White Wing) offensive launched by the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. According to statistics, from January 27 to March 7, a total of more than 7,540 enemy troops were annihilated, including 4,763 U.S. aggressors and more than 400 South Korean mercenary troops. Two battalions and six companies of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, one battalion and seven companies of the puppet army were completely wiped out. 301 enemy aircraft were shot down, damaged, or destroyed. 14 M-113 armored vehicles, 16 military vehicles, and 5 artillery pieces were destroyed.
    The communiqué stated that in order to realize the conspiracy of "nibbling" at the liberated areas and opening up Highway 1 between Bong Son and Quang Ngai, which had been cut off by the South Vietnamese army and people for more than a year, the U.S. aggressors dispatched more than 20,000 U.S. aggressors, South Vietnamese puppet troops, and South Korean mercenary troops, as well as more than 500 aircraft, to launch the so-called "Operation Masher" against the northern part of Binh Dinh Province in late January. This was the largest of the so-called "Five-pronged Offensive" launched by them since the beginning of the year, and it was also the largest and longest-lasting large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the South Vietnamese battlefield by the U.S.-puppet clique.
    The communiqué said that, contrary to the wishes of the U.S. aggressors, the U.S. aggressors fell into the vast ocean of people's war as soon as they entered the liberated area. At the beginning of the battle, the Liberation Army annihilated one enemy battalion and shot down and damaged hundreds of aircraft. At the same time, guerrillas in Hoai Nhon, Phu Cat, and Phu My counties also surrounded, attacked, and harassed the enemy day and night, causing heavy casualties to the U.S. aggressors.
    After suffering this heavy blow, the enemy transferred two battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps from Chu Lai base and broke into An Lao and Kim Son in Hoai An County, attempting to reinforce the 1st Cavalry Division, but to no avail. In the six days from February 15 to 20 alone, the Binh Dinh Provincial Liberation Army launched eight consecutive fierce attacks on the 1st Cavalry Division in Phu Ninh, Loc Giang, Phu Huu, and Da Tuong in the Kim Son area of Hoai An County, completely annihilating one battalion and four companies of U.S. aggressors, and severely damaging two other battalions, rendering the 3rd Brigade of this division completely incapable of fighting. On the night of February 20, the Liberation Armed Forces fiercely attacked the U.S. military forward command post located near Bong Son, causing heavy losses to the enemy. On February 23, the Liberation Army completely annihilated two companies of the 1st Cavalry Division in the Jiu Cheng area south of Bong Son. From February 21 to 25, the Liberation Armed Forces successively attacked the U.S. Marine Corps and the puppet army, completely annihilating one battalion and four companies, and severely damaging another battalion.
    After suffering a disastrous defeat, the U.S. aggressors gathered their remnants on March 7 and fled Bong Son in disgrace. This large-scale "mopping-up" operation ended in complete failure.
    The communiqué stated that in this battle, which lasted less than 40 days, one-third of the strength and three-quarters of the aircraft of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division were annihilated and destroyed by the Liberation Armed Forces.
    The communiqué pointed out that the great victory in Binh Dinh powerfully demonstrated the rapid growth of the South Vietnamese local Liberation Armed Forces in military technology and tactics. The army and people of Binh Dinh Province, with their resourceful and flexible tactics, defeated the many with the few, defeating more than 20,000 U.S. aggressors, South Vietnamese puppet troops, and South Korean mercenary troops. This once again shows that the power of people's war is invincible. (Attached picture)

    发挥人民战争威力　机智灵活以少胜多
    南越军民彻底粉碎美国侵略军“捣碎机攻势”
    歼敌七千五百多，消灭美骑一师三分之一兵力和四分之三飞机
    新华社河内二十四日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方中部中区解放武装力量指挥部最近发表公报说，平定省军民已彻底粉碎了美国第一骑兵师发动的所谓“捣碎机攻势”（后改称白翼攻势）。据统计，从一月二十七日到三月七日，共歼灭敌人七千五百四十多名，其中打死、打伤美国侵略军四千七百六十三名、南朝鲜帮凶军四百多名，全歼美国第一骑兵师两个营、六个连和伪军一个营、七个连，击落、击伤和炸毁敌机三百零一架，摧毁M—113型装甲车十四辆、军车十六辆、大炮五门。
    公报说，美国侵略者为了实现“蚕食”解放区、打通被南越军民切断了一年多的蓬山广义之间的一号公路的阴谋，一月下旬出动了两万多名美国侵略军、南越伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军，以及五百多架飞机，对平定省北部地区发动所谓“捣碎机攻势”，这是他们在年初以来发动的所谓“五路攻势”中规模最大的一路，也是美伪集团在南越战场上集中兵力最多和持续时间最长的一次大规模“扫荡”。
    公报说，但是，实际情况同美国侵略者的愿望相反，美国侵略军一进入解放区，就掉进了人民战争的汪洋大海中。战斗一开始，解放军就歼灭敌人一个营，击落和击伤成百架飞机。与此同时，怀仁、符吉和符美等县的游击队也夜以继日地包围、袭击和骚扰敌人，使美国侵略军遭到很大伤亡。
    在遭到这次惨重打击之后，敌人又从朱莱基地调来两个营的美国海军陆战队，闯进怀恩县安老和金山两地，妄图增援第一骑兵师，但也无济于事。仅从二月十五日到二十日的六天中，平定省解放军又在怀恩县金山地区的富宁、禄江、富友和多象等地，接连对第一骑兵师进行八次猛烈打击，全歼美国侵略军一个营和四个连，重创另两个营，使这个师的第三旅完全丧失了战斗力。二月二十日夜间，解放武装力量猛烈袭击设在蓬山附近的美军前方指挥所，使敌人遭到严重损失。二月二十三日，解放军又在蓬山南面的九成地区全歼第一骑兵师两个连。从二月二十一日到二十五日，解放武装力量又接连进攻美国海军陆战队和伪军，全歼敌人一个营和四个连，重创另一个营。
    美国侵略军遭到惨重失败之后，就在三月七日收拾残兵败将，狼狈撤出蓬山。敌人这次大规模“扫荡”就这样以彻底失败告终。
    公报说，在这个不足四十天的战役中，美国第一骑兵师三分之一的兵力和四分之三的飞机被解放武装力量歼灭和击毁。
    公报指出，平定大捷有力地说明了南越地方解放武装力量在军事技术和战术方面的迅速成长。平定省军民以机智灵活的战术，以少胜多，把两万多名美国侵略军、南越伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军打得落花流水。这又一次说明：人民战争的威力是无敌的。（附图片）
