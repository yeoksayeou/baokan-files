He said that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's upcoming friendly visit to Pakistan will further promote the friendship between China and Pakistan and promote the cause of Asian-African solidarity against imperialism.
    Chargé d'Affaires Durrani said that in the past year, Pakistan faced the most critical moment in its national survival. Our country was mobilized to prove its loyalty to our unwavering principles. Our cause has gained the sympathy of the whole world. He said, we can never forget what the Chinese government and people have done for us in our time of need.

We cooperate with China in many aspects of national activities.

Pakistan resolutely supports the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for national self-determination, and after India launched an armed attack on Pakistan, the whole country united and fought bravely to repel the aggressors and safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani government and people against aggression, and firmly support the Kashmiri people's struggle for the right to self-determination.
    Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi said that in recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Pakistan have developed significantly. We have strengthened economic and technological cooperation, and increased cultural exchanges and friendly interactions.

The friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples is built on the basis of opposing aggression and safeguarding justice, and is sincere and valuable. This friendship will surely develop from generation to generation.

    新华社二十三日讯　巴基斯坦驻中国大使馆临时代办杜拉尼为巴基斯坦国庆，今晚在大使馆举行招待会。
    周恩来总理，谢富治副总理，林枫副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，国防委员会副主席蔡廷锴等，应邀出席招待会，同杜拉尼临时代办和罗查大使的夫人共叙友谊。
    杜拉尼临时代办在招待会上宣读了罗查大使的讲话。谢富治副总理也在会上讲了话。他们祝贺中巴两国人民的友谊不断发展。谢富治副总理在讲话中重申：中国政府和人民坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反抗侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争。他说，刘少奇主席即将对巴基斯坦的友好访问，必将进一步促进中巴之间的友谊，促进亚非团结反帝事业。
    杜拉尼临时代办说，在以往的一年里，巴基斯坦面临了她的民族生存中最危急的时刻。我们国家被动员起来证明是忠于我们不能动摇的原则的。我们的事业获得了全世界的同情。他说，我们永远不能忘记中国政府和人民在我们需要的时刻为我们所做的事情，它确保了我们的友谊于真诚和深厚的相互谅解之中，这是巴中关系的一个新阶段。
    谈到刘少奇主席即将对巴基斯坦的访问时，临时代办说，巴基斯坦政府和人民迫切地期待着这一有历史意义的访问，以便使这一伟大国家的元首亲自看到每一个巴基斯坦公民对于中国对巴基斯坦的真诚友谊的崇高表现所怀有的深厚谢意。
    临时代办说，自从一九五八年革命以来，我们一直奉行着对所有国家友好而不对任何人怀有恶意的友好政策。我们在民族活动中的许多方面同中国合作。巴中边界协定以及航空、贸易和文化协定的签订促成了我们两国间坚强的合作结构。中巴合作结构在一天一天地增强起来，并将继续下去，因为它是符合我们两个国家的民族利益的。
    谢富治副总理在讲话中说，近几年来，在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，巴基斯坦奉行独立自主的政策，在国际事务中发挥着越来越重要的作用。巴基斯坦坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决权利的正义斗争，并且在印度向巴基斯坦发动了武装进攻之后，举国一致，奋勇抵抗，打退了侵略者，维护了国家主权和民族的尊严。中国政府和人民坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反抗侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争。
    谢富治副总理说，近几年来，中巴两国间的友好合作关系有了显著的发展。我们加强了经济技术合作，增进了文化交流和友好往来。我们在促进亚非团结反帝的事业中也进行了良好的合作。中巴两国人民的友谊是建立在反对侵略、维护正义的基础之上的，是真诚可贵的。这种友谊一定会世世代代地发展下去。
