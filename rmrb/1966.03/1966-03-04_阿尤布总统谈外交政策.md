    New China News Agency, Rawalpindi, 2nd dispatch: Pakistani President Ayub Khan, in a radio address on the evening of the 1st, spoke about Pakistan's foreign policy, saying, "The guiding principle of our foreign policy is that the differences between other countries should not hinder our relations with them. Therefore, while maintaining genuinely friendly relations with China, we are developing friendly relations with the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other." President Ayub Khan then spoke about the remarks made by U.S. Vice President Humphrey in Canberra, the Australian capital, after his visit to Pakistan, regarding Pakistan being "fully aware of the threat of Communist China," saying, "We immediately made our position very clear." He said, "China poses no threat to the subcontinent if that country is not unduly provoked."
    Ayub then said, "But I wish to reiterate: Pakistan attaches due importance to its relations with the United States, which have their own background, just as our relations with China have their background." Referring to the ministerial meeting between India and Pakistan being held in Rawalpindi, President Ayub Khan expressed his hope that "these discussions will produce results."
    He said, "The basic dispute between India and Pakistan concerns the right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir." He advocated that representatives of both countries try to understand it with a "realistic attitude and devote themselves to solving it."

    阿尤布总统谈外交政策
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二日电巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗一日晚间在广播讲话中谈到巴基斯坦的对外政策时说，“我们对外政策的指导原则是，其他国家之间的分歧不应妨害我们同它们之间的关系。因此，在我们同中国保持真正友好的关系的同时，我们正在发展一方面同美国、另一方面同苏联的友好关系。”阿尤布·汗总统接着谈到了美国副总统汉弗莱访问巴基斯坦以后在澳大利亚首都堪培拉发表的关于所谓巴基斯坦
  “充分知道共产党中国的威胁”的谈话，他说，“我们立即非常清楚地表明了我们的立场”。他说，“中国对次大陆没有威胁，如果不对那个国家进行无端挑衅的话。”
    阿尤布接着说，“但是我希望重申：巴基斯坦对于它与美国的关系给予应有的重视，这种关系有它自己的背景，就象我们同中国的关系有其背景一样。”在谈到正在拉瓦尔品第举行的印度和巴基斯坦两国部长级会议时，阿尤布·汗总统表示，他希望“这些讨论会产生成果”。
    他说，“印巴之间的基本争端关系到查谟和克什米尔人民的自决权。”他主张两国代表设法以“现实的态度来了解它和致力于解决它”。
