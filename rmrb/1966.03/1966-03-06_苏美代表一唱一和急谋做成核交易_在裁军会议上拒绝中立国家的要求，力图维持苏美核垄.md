    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 5th: In order to maintain their nuclear monopoly, the United States and the Soviet Union made a new deal on the 3rd at the Seventeen-Nation Disarmament Conference on quickly concluding a so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons." Ignoring the opposition of neutral countries, they agreed not to discuss other issues besides the so-called "non-proliferation" treaty, so as not to "complicate" matters and hinder reaching an agreement as soon as possible.
    United Press International believes that this shows that the Soviet Union and the United States "have moved one step closer toward a possible non-proliferation treaty."
    At the meeting on the 3rd, some neutral countries were not satisfied with merely negotiating the proposed "non-proliferation" treaty, and demanded that this treaty be linked to measures by countries that already possess nuclear weapons to reduce nuclear armaments. United Arab Republic representative Khallaf said that if non-nuclear countries are to give up the right to possess nuclear weapons, nuclear countries should also undertake the obligation to "begin to reduce and finally eliminate their nuclear weapons stockpiles." Otherwise, such a treaty would only "perpetuate" the current nuclear monopoly of nuclear countries, which is "precisely what broad world public opinion is worried about."
    However, the Soviet Union and the United States sang in harmony at the meeting, rejecting the demands of neutral countries.
    Soviet representative Tsarapkin said at the meeting that "the implementation of a non-proliferation treaty would undoubtedly be conducive to reaching agreements on other issues," and that "whether it is beneficial to intertwine several measures, or to make one measure dependent on the implementation of other measures, is doubtful. This will complicate already difficult negotiations."
    U.S. representative Fisher said in his speech that the United States hopes that an agreement on non-proliferation "will bring us closer to reaching agreements on other issues." He said: "But we cannot link the entry into force of one measure to the entry into force of another measure."
    United Press International wrote: "Tsarapkin's speech was welcomed by Western officials as a major contribution to the final agreement on a non-proliferation treaty. They said that Russia now seems prepared to negotiate really seriously."

    苏美代表一唱一和急谋做成核交易
    在裁军会议上拒绝中立国家的要求，力图维持苏美核垄断
    新华社五日讯　日内瓦消息：美国和苏联为了维持两国的核垄断地位，三日在十七国裁军会议上就迅速缔结所谓“防止核扩散条约”，作了一笔新的交易。它们不顾中立国家的反对，商定除讨论所谓“防止核扩散”条约以外，不讨论其他问题，以免使问题“复杂化”，妨碍尽快达成协议。
    合众国际社认为，这表明苏美“两国朝可能的防止核扩散条约方面又靠近了一步”。
    在三日的会议上，一些中立国家不满足于仅仅谈判建议中的“防止核扩散”条约，要求把这个条约同已经拥有核武器的国家裁减核军备的措施联系起来。阿联代表哈拉夫说，如果要无核国家放弃拥有核武器的权利，核国家也应该承担义务，“开始减少和最后消除它们的核武器储存”。否则，这样一个条约就只会使目前核国家对核武器的垄断“永久化”，而“这正是世界广大舆论所担心的”。
    但是，苏联和美国在会上一唱一和，拒绝了中立国家的要求。
    苏联代表查拉普金在会上说什么“实施防止扩散条约后无疑会有利于就其他问题取得协议”，“把几个措施交织在一起，或是使一个措施取决于其他措施的执行，这样是否有好处是值得怀疑的。这样会使已经很困难的谈判复杂化。”
    美国代表费希尔在发言中说，美国希望防止扩散的协议“会使我们接近于就其他问题达成协议。”他说：“但是我们不能把一个措施的生效同另一个措施的生效连系起来。”
    合众国际社写道：“查拉普金的发言受到西方官员的欢迎，认为这是对最后达成防止扩散条约的一个重大贡献。他们说，俄国现在看来准备真正认真谈判了。”
