    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th – The 11th Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front closed on the 15th. The meeting adopted a letter to the people, calling on the people of the whole country to unite as one and resolutely defeat the American invading robbers.

    The letter to the people also called on the people of the North to vigorously promote production, be ready to fight at any time, smash the war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, build a socialist North that is strong in economy and defense, and wholeheartedly support the revolution in the South, so that the cause of resisting America and saving the country can achieve final victory.

    The meeting began on the 12th. During the meeting, Trường Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, made a report on the new situation and new tasks.

    After analyzing the current situation in both North and South Vietnam, Trường Chinh pointed out that a prominent feature of the current situation is that U.S. imperialism, in its war of aggression against Vietnam, has sent a large U.S. expeditionary force to directly invade South Vietnam, while continuing to expand the destructive war against North Vietnam.

    Trường Chinh pointed out that the entire Vietnamese people are strengthening their unity and resisting America and saving the country with absolute confidence in complete victory. The facts on the battlefields of North and South Vietnam prove that the people of South Vietnam are fully capable of defeating the American robbers, regardless of whether the war they are waging is a "special war" or a local war, regardless of which branches of the military they use, and regardless of how brutal they are. The people of North Vietnam are also fully capable of defeating the destructive war of the American robbers, defending the North, and continuing to build socialism.

    He said that the more the Vietnamese military and civilians fight, the stronger they become, the more they win, and they will certainly win the final victory. The direct aggression of U.S. imperialism against South Vietnam and its attacks on the North further expose it as an international gendarme and the most ferocious and barbaric warmongering imperialism.

    Trường Chinh said that recently, U.S. imperialism launched a peace offensive. This is an extremely cunning trick aimed at covering up its continued strengthening of the war of aggression against South Vietnam and its continued "escalation" actions against North Vietnam.

    Speaking of the current tasks of the Vietnamese people, Trường Chinh said: Resisting America and saving the country is the sacred task of the entire Vietnamese people. Since U.S. imperialism has launched a war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese military and civilians will wage a people's war to eliminate it, defend the socialist North, liberate the South, realize the reunification of the motherland, and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam, as pointed out in the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front.

    He said that to accomplish this arduous and glorious task, the Vietnamese people must grasp the general strategic policy of long-term resistance and mainly relying on their own efforts.

    He said that the Vietnamese people must see through the warmongering and aggressive nature of the enemy, hate them even more, and be determined to defeat them under any circumstances; they must be vigilant against all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks, not be ambiguous about their nature, and not harbor illusions about their false peace rhetoric.

    Trường Chinh finally pointed out that the cause of the Vietnamese people's resistance to America and saving the country is a very great cause, which is not only of great significance to the destiny of the Vietnamese people, but also of great significance to the world revolution. The just struggle of the Vietnamese people against the U.S. imperialist aggressors will surely achieve final victory.

    The delegates attending the meeting also enthusiastically discussed the report made by Hoàng Quốc Việt on behalf of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and other supplementary reports. The meeting once again affirmed that no matter how cunning U.S. imperialism is, it will eventually not escape the fate of failure; although the Vietnamese people will have to go through fierce and arduous struggles, they will surely win the final victory.

    越南祖国战线中央扩大会议通过告人民书
    越南人民万众一心坚决打败美国强盗
    长征同志号召越南军民以人民战争消灭美国侵略者
    新华社河内十六日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会第十一次扩大会议十五日闭幕。会议通过了告人民书，号召全国人民团结一致，万众一心，坚决打败美国侵略强盗。
    告人民书还号召北方人民大力促进生产、随时准备战斗，粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋，建设一个在经济上和国防力量上强大的社会主义北方，全心全力支持南方革命，使抗美救国事业取得最后胜利。
    这次会议是十二日开始举行的。会议期间，越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南国会常务委员会主席、祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员长征作了关于新形势和新任务的报告。
    长征在分析了越南南北两方当前形势后指出，当前形势的一个突出特点是，美帝国主义在侵越战争中已经向越南南方开入一支庞大的美国远征军直接侵略越南南方，同时在继续扩大对越南北方的破坏性战争。
    长征指出，全越南人民正满怀着对完全胜利的绝对信心，加强团结，抗美救国。越南南北战场上的事实证明：越南南方人民完全有能力战胜美国强盗，不论它进行的战争形式是“特种战争”还是局部战争，不论它使用那些兵种和军种，也不论它残暴到什么程度。越南北方人民也完全有能力击败美国强盗的破坏性战争，保卫北方和继续建设社会主义。
    他说，越南军民越战越强，越战越胜，并一定赢得最后胜利。美帝国主义直接侵略越南南方和袭击北方，愈暴露出它是一个国际宪兵，一个最凶恶最野蛮的好战成性的帝国主义。
    长征说，最近，美帝国主义展开了一次和平攻势。这是一种极其狡猾的手段，目的在掩盖它继续加强侵略越南南方的战争和继续对越南北方采取“升级”的行动。
    长征在谈到越南人民的当前任务时说：抗美救国是越南全民的神圣任务。美帝国主义对越南发动了侵略战争，越南军民就进行人民战争来消灭它，保卫社会主义的北方，解放南方，实现祖国的统一，建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主、富强的越南，就象越南祖国战线的纲领所指出的那样。
    他说，要完成这个繁重和光荣的任务，越南人民必须掌握长期抗战、自力更生为主的总战略方针。
    他说，越南人民必须识透敌人的好战和侵略的本质，更加仇恨它们，并决心在任何情况下战胜它们；必须对敌人的一切阴谋和手段提高警惕，对它们的本质不要模糊，对它们的假和平论调不要抱有幻想。
    长征最后指出，越南人民的抗美救国事业是十分伟大的事业，它不但对越南人民的命运具有重大意义，而且对世界革命也有重要意义。越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争一定取得最后胜利。
    出席会议的代表们还热烈地讨论了黄国越代表越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团作的报告及其他补充报告。会议再一次肯定：不管美帝国主义如何狡猾，终究也逃不脱失败的命运；越南人民虽然要经过激烈和艰苦的斗争，但是一定会赢得最后胜利。
