Title: Vietnamese "People's Daily" Exposes Yugoslav Leaders as Running Dogs of U.S. Imperialism; Tito Clique's Promotion of U.S. Peace Talk Swindle Doomed to Failure; Stambolic's Visit to India is to Orchestrate New Actions to Exert Pressure on the Vietnamese People

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 21st – The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published a commentary on the 21st, condemning the Yugoslav Tito clique's attempt to once again promote the U.S. imperialist "peace talk" swindle.

    The commentary, entitled "The Tito Clique is Again Promoting the U.S. 'Peace Discussion' Swindle," said that Yugoslav Prime Minister Stambolic's recent visit to India and other Asian countries was an attempt to have the governments of these countries join Yugoslavia in calling for "discussions" on the Vietnam issue. This is a new action by the Tito clique aimed at promoting the U.S. imperialist "peace discussion" swindle and attempting to exert pressure on the Vietnamese people.

    The commentary said that the Tito clique's face as a running dog of the United States, serving the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam, has long been exposed. In the past, the Tito clique supported the U.S. conspiracy to shove the Saigon puppet regime into the United Nations. After the United States sent planes to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 5, 1964, they followed the United States in slandering the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the past year, the Tito clique has worked even harder to help the United States carry out conspiracies to deceive world public opinion, attempting to cover up the U.S. strengthening of its war of aggression against South Vietnam and its destructive war against North Vietnam with the air force.

    The commentary pointed out that last March, just as the U.S. aggressors were deeply mired in Vietnam, the Tito clique wrote to U.S. President Johnson, offering the tactic of "peace discussions" to save the U.S. from its predicament. Subsequently, they pulled in some non-aligned countries to call for "discussions" on the Vietnam issue. At the end of July last year, just as Johnson decided to send 50,000 more U.S. troops to South Vietnam, Tito met with U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Harriman, after which he put forward the so-called "three-point plan" regarding the Vietnam issue. Last year, during the 20th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, Tito also gave a speech demanding that the United Nations intervene in the Vietnam issue.

    The commentary said that all of the Tito clique's actions show that they are wholeheartedly serving the U.S. policy of aggression and division of Vietnam, and serving the U.S. "unconditional discussion" trick. In various activities, the Tito clique has tried to place the U.S. aggressors and the Vietnamese people on an equal footing, and has tried every means to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people who are fighting for their own right to survival.

    The commentary said, however, that these conspiracies of the Tito clique have long been exposed. The Vietnamese people strongly condemn these conspiracies, and world public opinion also opposes them. Some non-aligned countries that signed the appeal of the non-aligned countries conference initiated by the Tito clique in March 1965 due to a lack of understanding also indicated that they no longer support the appeal. Last September, Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in a letter replying to Tito's "three-point plan," firmly refuted Tito's despicable intentions and emphasized: "All peace proposals that superficially legitimize the U.S. aggression and clinging on in South Vietnam are inevitably doomed to failure."

    The commentary said that the Tito clique is still trying to peddle the U.S. imperialist "peace discussion" slow-moving goods, which proves that they intend to continue to confuse world public opinion, curry favor with the United States, and continue to act as a runner for the United States. This kind of action will inevitably lead them to even more shameful failure.

    越《人民报》揭露南斯拉夫领导人充当美帝走狗
    铁托集团推销美国和谈骗局必遭失败
    斯坦鲍利奇访印是为了策划对越南人民施加压力的新行动
    新华社河内二十一日电　越南《人民报》二十一日发表评论，谴责南斯拉夫铁托集团妄图再次推销美帝国主义“和谈”骗局的阴谋。
    这篇题为《铁托集团又在推销美国的“和平讨论”骗局》的评论说，南斯拉夫总理斯坦鲍利奇最近访问印度等一些亚洲国家，企图要这些国家的政府同南斯拉夫一起呼吁就越南问题进行“讨论”。这是铁托集团旨在推销美帝国主义的“和平讨论”骗局，和妄图对越南人民施加压力的一种新行动。
    评论说，铁托集团充当美国走狗，为美国对越南的侵略政策效劳的面目早就被揭穿了。过去，铁托集团曾支持美国把西贡伪政权塞进联合国的阴谋。一九六四年八月五日美国派遣飞机轰炸越南民主共和国之后，他们又追随美国诬蔑越南民主共和国政府。最近一年来，铁托集团更加竭力帮助美国推行欺骗世界舆论的阴谋，企图掩盖美国加强对越南南方的侵略战争和用空军对越南北方的破坏性战争。
    评论指出，去年三月，正当美国侵略者在越南深深陷入泥潭的时候，铁托集团写信给美国总统约翰逊，献上了“和平讨论”的计策，以便挽救美国的窘境。接着，他们又拉上一些不结盟国家，呼吁就越南问题进行“讨论”。去年七月底，就在约翰逊决定增派五万名美军到南越去的时候，铁托同美国无任所大使哈里曼会晤，然后他提出了关于越南问题的所谓“三点计划”。去年，在联合国成立二十周年期间，铁托还发表讲话要求联合国干涉越南问题。
    评论说，铁托集团的所有上述作法，表明他们一心一意地为美国侵略和分割越南的政策效劳，为美国的“无条件讨论”诡计服务。铁托集团在各种活动中，力图把美国侵略者和越南人民放在同等地位上，并且千方百计地束缚正在为争取自己的生存权利而进行战斗的越南人民的双手。
    评论说，但是，铁托集团的这些阴谋早已被揭穿。越南人民强烈谴责这些阴谋，世界舆论也反对这些阴谋。由于不了解情况而在由铁托集团倡议的一九六五年三月的不结盟国家会议的呼吁书上签字的一些不结盟国家，不久也表示再不支持这项呼吁书了。去年九月，柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王在答复铁托的“三点计划”的信件时，坚决驳斥了铁托的卑鄙意图，并强调指出：“为使美国在越南南方的侵略和死赖着不走表面上合法化的一切和平建议，都是避免不了失败的。”
    评论说，铁托集团仍然竭力推销美帝国主义的“和平讨论”滞销货，这就证明他们打算继续迷惑世界舆论，向美国邀功，继续充当为美国跑腿的角色。这种行动必定会把他们引到更加可耻的失败。
