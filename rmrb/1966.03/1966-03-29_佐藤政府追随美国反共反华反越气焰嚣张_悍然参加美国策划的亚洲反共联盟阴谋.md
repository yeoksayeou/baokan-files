    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina announced on the 23rd during a session of the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that the Japanese Sato government has decided to participate in the second preparatory meeting of the "Foreign Ministers' Conference" of Asian anti-communist countries and puppet groups, scheduled to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on April 10.
    The "Foreign Ministers' Conference" of Asian anti-communist countries and puppet groups is being prepared under the planning and direction of US imperialism, with the South Korean puppet group taking the lead. The first preparatory meeting was held in Bangkok in March last year, and the Sato government also sent representatives to participate at that time.
    According to reports, the participants in the second preparatory meeting include Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, "Malaysia," the South Vietnamese puppet group, the South Korean puppet group, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. They will exchange views on the "Vietnam and China issues."
    In the run-up to the "Foreign Ministers' Conference" of Asian anti-communist countries and puppet groups, the Sato government will hold a "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" in Tokyo on April 6. These two conferences are coordinated, and their purpose is to follow the will of US imperialism, to cobble together an "anti-communist military alliance" to "contain" China in Asia and to directly serve the US imperialists in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, *Akahata*, exposed and condemned on the 24th that the purpose of the "Foreign Ministers' Conference" that the Japanese Sato government is preparing to participate in is to cobble together an "anti-communist military alliance" in Asia and to more actively support the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.

    佐藤政府追随美国反共反华反越气焰嚣张
    悍然参加美国策划的亚洲反共联盟阴谋
    据新华社二十六日讯  日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎二十三日在参议院预算委员会答辩时宣布，日本佐藤政府已决定参加四月十日在泰国曼谷举行的亚洲反共国家和傀儡集团的“外长会议”第二次筹备会议。
    亚洲反共国家和傀儡集团“外长会议”是在美帝国主义的策划和指挥下，由南朝鲜傀儡集团出面筹备的，第一次筹备会议已经在去年三月间在曼谷举行，那时佐藤政府也曾派代表参加。
    据报道，参加第二次筹备会议的，有日本、菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰、“马来西亚”、南越傀儡集团、南朝鲜傀儡集团以及蒋介石集团。它们将就“越南和中国问题”交换意见。
    在举行亚洲反共国家和傀儡集团的“外长会议”的前夕，佐藤政府将在四月六日在东京举行“东南亚开发部长会议”。这两个会议是相互配合的，它们的目的都是秉承美帝国主义的意旨，在亚洲拼凑“遏制”中国的“反共军事联盟”、并且直接为美帝扩大侵越战争效劳。
    日共中央机关报《赤旗报》二十四日揭露并谴责日本佐藤政府准备参加的“外长会议”的目的是在亚洲拼凑一个“反共军事联盟”和更积极地支持美帝国主义的侵越战争。
