    North Korean and Vietnamese Newspapers Condemn US-British Imperialism for Orchestrating the Reactionary Coup in Ghana
    African People Will Surely Strengthen Unity to Smash Imperialist Counterattacks
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th – Pyongyang Dispatch: North Korea's *Rodong Sinmun* (Workers' Daily) published an editorial on the 3rd, stating that the coup in Ghana was a reactionary military coup orchestrated by US and British imperialists and their running dogs. The Korean people firmly support the African people's steadfast position and unwavering determination to crush the imperialists' counter-revolutionary offensive with united strength.
    The editorial listed the various acts of sabotage and conspiracies that US and British imperialists have long carried out against Ghana. The editorial stated that the coup in Ghana is part of a sinister conspiracy long planned by US and British imperialists, and also a blatant link in the imperialists' scheme in Africa to subvert one by one those governments that do not suit their wishes, to strangle the progress of the people on the African continent, and to re-enslave the African people.
    The editorial stated that in recent years, the struggle for liberation and freedom on the African continent has surged even higher. Many countries have adopted independent policies based on opposition to imperialism. The imperialists, headed by the United States, are very afraid of this anti-imperialist and independent stance of the African people. In order to hinder the development of this trend, they have exhausted all kinds of means and methods, and frequently and blatantly carried out sabotage activities and reactionary coup conspiracies.
    The editorial emphasized that these shameless acts of the new and old colonialists are a challenge to all African people and progressive people worldwide. The Korean people cannot turn a blind eye to this provocative attack by the imperialists. We resolutely condemn the despicable activities of the imperialists and their running dogs in undermining national independence and freedom, and attempting to detach Ghana and other African countries from the anti-imperialist front.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th – Hanoi Dispatch: Vietnam’s *Nhân Dân* (People's Daily) reported on the recent military coup in Ghana on the 1st, saying that it is clear that this coup was launched by pro-imperialist forces within Ghana under the instigation of US and British imperialists.
    The newspaper pointed out that British and American imperialists, through British and American newspapers and radio stations, have undisguisedly expressed their "sympathy" and "satisfaction" with the Ghanaian military coup. The newspaper said that US and British imperialists instigated their running dogs to launch a coup to overthrow President Kwame Nkrumah, attempting to create a situation in Ghana that is conducive to their implementation of neo-colonialist policies.
    The newspaper pointed out that the military coup in Ghana further exposes the increasingly shameless conspiracies of the imperialists against independent African countries in order to undermine African unity and hinder the surging anti-imperialist and anti-neo/old colonialist movement in Africa.
    The newspaper said that the military coup in Ghana has angered the governments and people of African countries. The actions of US and British imperialists and their running dogs in Ghana will only make the people of African countries more vigilant and strengthen their unity to oppose the imperialists and colonialists headed by the United States.

    朝鲜越南报纸谴责美英帝国主义制造加纳反动政变
    非洲人民必将加强团结粉碎帝国主义反扑
    新华社五日讯　平壤消息：朝鲜《劳动新闻》三日发表社论说，加纳政变是美、英帝国主义者及其走狗制造的一次反动的军事政变。朝鲜人民坚决支持非洲人民以团结的力量粉碎帝国主义的反革命攻势的坚定立场和不可动摇的决心。
    社论列举了美、英帝国主义者长期以来对加纳进行的各种破坏和阴谋活动。社论说，加纳的这次政变是美、英帝国主义者长期策划的罪恶阴谋的一部分，也是帝国主义在非洲企图逐一颠覆那些不合自己心意的政府、扼杀非洲大陆人民的进步和重新奴役非洲人民的露骨的阴谋活动的一环。
    社论说，近年来，非洲大陆争取解放和自由的斗争更加高涨。许多国家站在反对帝国主义的立场上奉行自主政策。以美国为首的帝国主义者非常害怕非洲人民的这种反帝自主的立场。为了阻挡这种趋势的发展，他们用尽了各种手段和方法，频繁地、露骨地进行破坏活动和制造反动政变阴谋。
    社论强调指出，新老殖民主义者的这种无耻行径是对全体非洲人民和全世界进步人民的挑战。朝鲜人民对帝国主义者的这种挑衅性的攻击绝不能视而不见。我们坚决谴责帝国主义及其走狗破坏民族独立和自由、企图使加纳等非洲国家脱离反帝战线的卑鄙活动。
    新华社五日讯　河内消息：越南《人民报》一日在报道最近在加纳发生军事政变的消息时说，显然，这次政变是加纳国内的亲帝国主义势力在美、英帝国主义的唆使下发动的。
    报纸指出，英、美帝国主义者通过英国和美国的报纸和电台毫不掩饰地表示他们对加纳军事政变的“同情”和“满意”。报纸说，美、英帝国主义者唆使他们的走狗发动推翻恩克鲁玛总统的政变，试图在加纳制造有利于他们实行新殖民主义政策的局势。
    报纸指出，加纳的军事政变进一步暴露了帝国主义者为了破坏非洲团结、阻挠非洲目前正在汹涌澎湃的反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的运动而对非洲独立国家进行的日益增加的无耻阴谋。
    报纸说，加纳的军事政变使非洲国家的政府和人民感到愤怒。美、英帝国主义及其在加纳的走狗的行动只会使非洲各国人民提高警惕，加强团结来反对以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者。
