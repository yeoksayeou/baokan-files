    Lin You County Party Committee Studies Jiao Yulu in the Spirit of Rectification
    Promoting Democracy to Carry Out Criticism and Self-Criticism
    County Party Committee Standing Committee Comrades Consciously Revolutionize, Basic-Level Cadres and Masses Enthusiastically Help Leaders Achieve Revolutionization
    (Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Lin You County Party Committee, Shaanxi Province, in the activity of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, promoted democracy, mobilized cadres and the masses to offer opinions and criticisms to the county party committee leading cadres, and further promoted the ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization of the leadership.
    After the publication of Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds, the Lin You County Party Committee held three Standing Committee meetings to compare themselves with Jiao Yulu and examine their ideology and work. In the discussion, everyone believed that to truly learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, it is necessary to implement the spirit of rectification. Therefore, the county party committee decided that, on the one hand, within the county party committee Standing Committee, studying Jiao Yulu should be regarded as an important part of studying Chairman Mao's works, studying diligently, comparing and examining diligently, summing up work diligently, conducting self-criticism, adhering to self-revolution, and improving ideological understanding; on the other hand, while organizing cadres and the masses to learn from Jiao Yulu, they should fully promote democracy, mobilize cadres and the masses, use Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, offer opinions to the county party committee, especially to the comrades of the Standing Committee, and carry out criticism to promote the revolutionary work of the county party committee leadership. After the county party committee made this decision, it immediately forwarded the examination of the county party committee secretary Liu Zhenzhou and the county party committee Standing Committee member and county magistrate Chen Zhichao to various agencies and communes, encouraging cadres and the masses to actively offer criticisms and opinions to the county party committee leadership.
    The Lin You County Party Committee's determination to resolutely learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu and thoroughly realize revolutionization aroused strong reactions among the cadres and masses throughout the county. Many cadres and the masses enthusiastically helped the county party committee leading cadres to find shortcomings, find key points, improve thinking, and improve work. In the past half month, the county party committee received more than 400 criticisms and suggestions from county-level agencies and communes. Most of these criticisms and suggestions are correct, full of revolutionary passion, and hold earnest expectations for the realization of revolutionization by the county party committee leading cadres. They reflect the opinions and requirements of cadres and the masses, and raise the main problems in the leadership's ideology and work of the county party committee. These problems are mainly: first, the county party committee leadership looks back more and looks forward less; second, the county party committee's leadership work involves more general appeals and less specific guidance; third, the county party committee's leading cadres do not go deep into reality and the masses enough.
    These opinions and criticisms from cadres and the masses have given the county party committee leading cadres a profound revolutionary education. They believe that the main reason is that they have not studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well, and their subjective world has not been transformed enough, and individualistic thoughts exist to varying degrees in their minds. Liu Zhenzhou said in his experience of this study that to truly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must dare to revolutionize the individualism in one's own thoughts, fully promote democracy, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that improving leadership work can be based on a solid and reliable foundation, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses can be better mobilized.
    On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the county party committee decided to take Jiao Yulu as an example and take action immediately. Under the leadership of the county party committee leading cadres, at present, more than 70 percent of the cadres in county-level agencies are taking the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", holding farm tools, and fighting on the front line of production together with the broad masses, and have also organized three investigation groups for forestry, animal husbandry, and water, and started a comprehensive and systematic investigation and research work in the entire county. Because the county party committee leadership and a large number of cadres have gone deep into the countryside, discussed major issues with the masses, and listened to the opinions of the masses, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses have been greatly encouraged. For example, the county originally planned to build 54 new canals this year to expand the irrigation area by 3,600 mu. Before a large number of cadres went to the countryside, it had been overfulfilled. After the cadres went to the countryside, the enthusiasm of the masses was even greater. Now 131 canals have been built, which can irrigate more than 6,000 mu of land. County Party Committee Secretary Liu Zhenzhou went to Caijiahe Brigade of Zhentou Commune to dig pit fields with commune members, and studied and improved the method of digging pit fields with commune members, which doubled the work efficiency. The commune members happily said: As long as the county party committee secretary continues to work with us like this, it will not be difficult to change the backward situation.

    麟游县委以整风精神学习焦裕禄
    发扬民主认真进行批评和自我批评
    县委常委会同志自觉革命，基层干部和群众热情帮助领导实现革命化
    据新华社西安一日电  中共陕西省麟游县委在向焦裕禄同志学习的活动中，发扬民主，动员干部和群众对县委领导干部提出意见和批评，进一步促进了领导思想革命化和工作革命化。
    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹发表以后，麟游县委开了三次常委会，对照焦裕禄，检查思想和工作。在讨论中，大家认为，要真正把焦裕禄同志的革命精神学到手，必须贯彻整风的精神。于是县委决定，一方面在县委常委会内部，把学习焦裕禄作为学习毛主席著作的重要部分，认真学，认真对照检查，认真总结工作，进行自我批评，坚持自我革命，提高思想认识；另一方面，在组织干部和群众向焦裕禄学习的同时，充分发扬民主，发动干部和群众，把焦裕禄同志作为镜子，向县委、特别是向常委会的同志提意见，开展批评，促进县委领导工作革命化。县委作出这个决定以后，立刻把县委书记刘振洲和县委常委、县长陈志超等的检查，批转到各机关、公社，鼓励干部和群众积极对县委领导提出批评和意见。
    麟游县委这种坚决向焦裕禄同志学习，彻底实现革命化的决心，在全县干部和群众中引起了强烈的反应，许多干部和群众热情地帮助县委领导干部，找差距，找关键，提高思想和改进工作。半个多月来，县委收到来自县级机关和公社的批评、建议四百多条。这些批评和建议，绝大部分是正确的，充满着革命激情，对县委领导干部实现革命化抱着殷切的期望，反映了干部和群众的意见和要求，提出了县委领导思想和工作中的主要问题。这些问题主要是，第一，县委领导向后看的多，向前看的少；第二，县委的领导工作一般号召多，具体指导少；第三，县委的领导干部，深入实际，深入群众不够。
    这些来自干部、群众的意见和批评，使县委领导干部受到一次深刻的革命教育。他们认为，主要的是没有很好地活学活用毛主席著作，对主观世界改造得不够，在头脑中程度不同地存在着个人主义的杂念。刘振洲谈到他这次学习的体会说，要真心学焦裕禄同志，就要敢于革自己思想中个人主义的命，就要充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，这样才能使改进领导工作建立在扎实可靠的基础上，才能更好地调动干部、群众的积极性。
    在提高思想认识的基础上，县委决定以焦裕禄为榜样，立刻行动起来。在县委领导干部的带头下，目前，全县县级机关已有百分之七十以上的干部，带着《毛泽东选集》，拿着农具，和广大群众一起，战斗在生产第一线，并且组织了林、牧、水三个调查组，在全县范围内，开始了全面系统的调查研究工作。由于县委领导和大批干部深入农村，同群众共商大事，听取群众意见，极大地鼓舞了群众的政治热情和生产积极性。例如，全县原计划今年新修五十四条水渠，扩大灌溉面积三千六百亩，在大批干部下乡之前，已经超额完成。干部下乡之后，群众干劲更大，现在已经修成一百三十一条，可以灌溉六千多亩田地。县委书记刘振洲到镇头公社蔡家河大队和社员一起挖坑田，同社员一起研究改进挖坑田的办法，使工效提高了一倍。社员高兴地说：只要县委书记同我们这样干下去，不难改变落后面貌。
