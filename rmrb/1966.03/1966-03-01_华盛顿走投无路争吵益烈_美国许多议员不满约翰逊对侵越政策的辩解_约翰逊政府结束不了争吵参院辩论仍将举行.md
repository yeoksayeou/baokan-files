　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th -- Washington news: The great debate among American congressmen on the United States' policy toward Vietnam is continuing. Congressmen, both inside and outside the chambers, have been issuing statements opposing the Johnson administration's "escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam, expressing unease about the "serious dangers" that expanding the war would bring to the United States. At the same time, they are vying with each other to offer advice in an attempt to maintain the United States' rule in South Vietnam.
　　Just hours after Johnson held a press conference, Senator Clark, a Democrat member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a speech in San Francisco on the 26th that he disagreed with Johnson's statement that he was "very happy" that the differences between some congressmen criticizing the American war in Vietnam and the government were "so small." Clark said that if Johnson's policy is to continue to escalate, "then I must say that the President and I are, in fact, very far apart."
　　He said that the Senate's major debate on the Vietnam issue "clearly points out the danger of following the hawkish approach advocated by some government leaders...". This fierce debate is intended to "force the government to painfully reassess... its basic view of our involvement in Vietnam."
　　Clark said that greatly increasing the number of American troops in Vietnam and expanding the bombing there will cost the United States dearly in terms of casualties and money. He said that expanding the Vietnam War would bring significant political setbacks to the Johnson administration because "the American people are precisely opposed to the escalation of this conflict."
　　Clark also reminded that the United States' policy toward Vietnam has also alienated most of the United States' allies.
　　Following Gavin and Kennan, Clark also advocated a "hold the line" strategy for the United States in Vietnam. He said: "We should increase our troops, our armaments, and our financial obligations only to the extent necessary to maintain our current position."
　　He also criticized the Johnson administration for not being "genuinely committed to a peaceful solution" because it is actually saying that it wants to "achieve a complete victory" over communism, which is "not only militarily impossible but also an unconsidered attitude."
　　Senator Morse, who has recently criticized the United States' policy toward Vietnam in succession, after demanding the revocation of the 1964 congressional resolution supporting the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy, delivered a lengthy speech in the Senate on the 25th, accusing the government of planning a major war in Asia. In explaining why he voted against the government's increased appropriations for the Vietnam War, he said that if this appropriation is passed, the Senate "is providing a blank check for American defense spending" to expand the war.
　　Senator Stennis, Chairman of the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, said in a speech to the Reserve Officers Association on the same day, calling on the Johnson administration to conduct a "new and sober assessment" of the United States' "military obligations around the world and our ability to fulfill those obligations." He warned that the Vietnam War has almost exhausted the strategic reserves of the active army. He believes that it is difficult to send a large number of troops to Vietnam "without calling up reserve troops or weakening our troops in Western Europe and Korea." He said that the war's consumption "has caused serious problems in terms of personnel, equipment, repair parts, and other materials... Our military capabilities around the world have been damaged."
　　Referring to the Johnson administration's establishment of new troops to remedy the weakness of insufficient military strength, Stennis said: "This is very time-consuming, and the new troops being established now will not be ready for combat for many months."
　　Embarrassed by this great debate, the Johnson administration attempted yesterday to end the debate in the Senate by means of a vote. However, "after forty minutes of chaos, frustration, and roll call," this attempt failed because the number of people present did not reach the quorum. The Senate debate will continue on Monday.

### 华盛顿走投无路争吵益烈  美国许多议员不满约翰逊对侵越政策的辩解  约翰逊政府结束不了争吵参院辩论仍将举行

    华盛顿走投无路争吵益烈
    美国许多议员不满约翰逊对侵越政策的辩解
    约翰逊政府结束不了争吵参院辩论仍将举行
    新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会议员关于美国对越南政策的大辩论正在继续进行中。议员们在会里会外纷纷发表谈话，反对约翰逊政府把侵越战争“升级”，对扩大战争会给美国带来的“严重危险”表示不安。同时，他们又争相献计，企图维持美国在南越的统治地位。
    在约翰逊刚举行记者招待会几个小时之后，参议院外交委员会委员、民主党参议员克拉克二十六日在旧金山发表的一篇演说中，表示不同意约翰逊所说的他“很高兴”一些批评美国进行越南战争的国会议员同政府之间的分歧是“如此之小”。克拉克说，如果约翰逊的政策是继续升级，“那么我要说总统和我事实上是分歧很大的”。
    他说，参议院中关于越南问题的大辩论“明确指出了追随一些政府领导人……鼓吹的好战方针的危险”。这场激烈的辩论是为了“迫使政府忍痛地重新估计……它对我们卷入越南一事的基本观点”。
    克拉克说，大大增加在越南的美军和扩大对那里的轰炸，美国在人员伤亡和金钱耗费方面都将付出浩大的代价。他说，扩大越南战争会给约翰逊政府带来重大的政治挫折，因为“美国人正是反对这场冲突的升级”。
    克拉克还提醒说，美国对越南的政策还疏远了美国的大部分盟国。
    继加文和凯南之后，克拉克也主张美国在越南采取“固守”战略。他说：“我们增加我们的部队、我们的军备、我们的财政义务应当只达到为保持我们目前的地位所必需的程度”。
    他还批评约翰逊政府并不是“真正致力于和平解决”，因为它实际上在说要对共产主义
  “取得完全的胜利”，而“这不仅是在军事上是不可能的事，而且是一种未经深思的态度。”
    最近接连批评美国对越南政策的参议员莫尔斯在要求撤销一九六四年国会支持约翰逊政府越南政策的决议之后，二十五日又在参议院发表长篇演说，指责政府打算在亚洲进行一场大战。他在解释他为什么投票反对政府增拨款项来进行越南战争的时候说，如果通过这笔款项，参议院“就是为美国防务开支提供一张空白支票”来扩大战争。
    战备委员会主席、参议员斯坦尼斯同一天在后备役军官协会发表演说时，要求约翰逊政府对美国“在全世界承担的军事义务和我们履行义务的能力”进行“新的和清醒的估计”。他警告说，越南战争几乎用尽了现役军队的战略后备力量。他认为，要向越南大量增派军队“而又不征召后备役部队或削弱我们在西欧和朝鲜的部队”，那是很难的。他说，战争的消耗“在人员、装备、修理部件和其他物资方面造成了严重的问题……我们在全世界的军事能力受到了损伤。”
    谈到约翰逊政府正在建立新的部队以补救兵力不足的弱点时，斯坦尼斯说：“这是很花时间的，现在正在建立的新部队在好多个月内不会作好战斗准备。”
    被这场大辩论搞得处境尴尬的约翰逊政府昨天企图在参议院用表决方法结束这场辩论。但是，“参议院在经过了四十分钟的混乱、挫折和唱名之后”，由于到会人数不到法定人数，这个企图未能得逞。参议院辩论星期一将继续举行。（附图片）
