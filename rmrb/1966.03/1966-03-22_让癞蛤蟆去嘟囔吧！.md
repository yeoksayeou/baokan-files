    Let the Toads Croak!
    Leng Ran
    A toad, crouching in a stinking ditch, sees an eagle spreading its wings and soaring in the boundless sky, and finds it extremely displeasing. So, it croaks, "Flying so high, it's really insane!"
    Such toads from fables can often be encountered in real life. For example, the American *New York Herald Tribune* finds the Chinese people's action of learning from Jiao Yulu extremely displeasing. This newspaper wrote: "Judging by the nature of the heroic figures of Communist China, he seems to be tormented by the demands of life," which is "inconceivable." Therefore, it believes that asking people to learn from Jiao Yulu is a kind of "semi-hysterical tone."
    It is not at all surprising that American bourgeois newspapers would make such remarks.
    What is good? What is evil? What is noble? What is base? Different societies and different classes always have different standards. Therefore, the "heroic figures" in the eyes of imperialists and the heroic figures in the eyes of revolutionary people are also completely different.
    In the United States under the imperialist system, what kind of people are regarded as "heroes"? Just look at the various books and periodicals carefully manufactured and widely distributed under the encouragement of the American ruling clique. There, the executioners who massacre the Vietnamese people and the Dominican people, cunning and insidious politicians, as well as robbers who rob and steal, thugs who extort and deceive, criminals who rape women, and all kinds of ferocious and vicious villains have become admired heroes. The bloody "heroic deeds" of these characters are described in vivid detail with an admiring tone. Isn't this insane? However, since toads consider the mold in the stinking ditch to be beautiful, it is of course reasonable for American imperialists to regard these dregs of humanity as "heroes."
    Similarly, for American imperialists, the situation in China is indeed something they cannot comprehend. Because their creed of life is: everything for me, profit is the only goal; in order to benefit oneself, one can harm others as much as possible. Now, in China, communist fighters like Jiao Yulu, who serve the people wholeheartedly, are constantly emerging, and the hundreds of millions of Chinese people are actually using these revolutionary fighters as their role models. How could they not, like toads seeing eagles flying, feel that this is an "insane" action?
    Therefore, the more those despicable characters hiding in the stinking ditch dislike our heroes, the more it proves how noble the revolutionary qualities and revolutionary spirit of our proletarian fighters are. The more they curse us for being "insane," the more it proves that our actions are correct.
    Let those American toads croak. The Chinese people, like eagles, will continue to spread their wings and soar into the sky!

    让癞蛤蟆去嘟囔吧！
    冷然
    癞蛤蟆匍伏在臭水坑里，看见雄鹰在万里高空展翅翱翔，觉得太不顺眼。于是，它嘟囔说：“飞得那么高，真是发疯了！”
    寓言里的这种癞蛤蟆，在现实生活中也经常可以碰到。例如，美国《纽约先驱论坛报》对于中国人民学习焦裕禄的行动就大为看不顺眼。这家报纸写道：“从共产党中国的英雄人物的性质来看，他似乎是被生活的要求所折磨”，这是“不可思议”的。因此，它认为，要人们向焦裕禄学习，是一种“半歇斯底里的调子”。
    美国资产阶级报纸发出这样的议论，是丝毫也不令人奇怪的。
    什么是善？什么是恶？什么是高尚？什么是卑污？不同的社会、不同的阶级，总是有着不同的标准。因此，帝国主义心目中的“英雄人物”和革命人民心目中的英雄人物，也是截然不同的。
    在帝国主义制度下的美国，什么样的人物被当成“英雄”呢？翻翻在美国统治集团鼓励下精心制造并大量发行的各种图书和报刊吧。在那里，屠杀越南人民、多米尼加人民的刽子手，狡诈阴险的政客，以及打家劫舍的强盗，勒索行骗的歹徒，奸淫妇女的罪犯，和各色各样凶残狠毒的恶棍，都成了受到推崇的好汉。这类人物的血淋淋的“英雄业绩”，都被一种赞叹的笔调在绘声绘色地描述着。这不是发疯了吗？但是，既然对癞蛤蟆来说，臭水沟里的霉菌是美好的，那么，对美帝国主义者来说，把这些人类的渣滓看作“英雄”当然也就是理所当然的了。
    同样，对于美帝国主义者来说，在中国出现的情况确实也是他们所不可思议的。因为，他们的生活信条是：一切为我，唯利是图；为了利己，尽可损人。现在，在中国居然不断涌现出象焦裕禄那样全心全意为人民服务的共产主义战士，而且中国亿万人民居然还以这些革命战士作为自己的学习榜样，他们怎么会不象癞蛤蟆看到雄鹰飞翔一样，觉得这是一种“发疯”的行动呢？
    因此，那些钻在臭水坑里的卑污的角色越是对我们的英雄看不顺眼，就越是证明我们无产阶级战士有着多么高尚的革命品质和革命精神。他们越是咒骂我们“发疯”，就越是证明我们的行动是正确的。
    让美国的那些癞蛤蟆去嘟囔吧。中国人民将象雄鹰一样，继续奋展双翅而冲天高飞！
