    Solidly Stationing and Creating Models
    —How the Xingzi County Party Committee of Jiangxi Province Handled Various Relationship Issues During the Stationing Process
    In 1965, the Xingzi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, through repeated study of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," diligently changed its leadership ideology and style in leading agricultural production according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and solidly stationed itself to create models; in the process of stationing, it handled a series of relationship issues according to Chairman Mao's thought, enabling the county to achieve a large-scale balanced increase in production, with the average grain yield per mu exceeding the target set by the "National Agricultural Development Program" for the first time.
    In summarizing its work in 1965, the county party committee deeply realized: "The more you read Chairman Mao's books, the more you progress; the less you read, the less you progress; if you don't read, you don't progress. The more you listen to Chairman Mao's words, the more production increases; the less you listen, the less production increases; if you don't listen, production doesn't increase."
    Where to Start Changing the Production Outlook?
    The county party committee's summary first reviewed the causes of their change in leadership ideology and methods.
    The Xingzi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had long wanted to bring the county's average grain yield per mu to reach and exceed the target set by the "National Agricultural Development Program." However, year after year, it had not been achieved. What was the reason? In the past, some people often attributed the blame to objective reasons, blaming the weather (either floods or droughts), blaming the land (high mountains and cold water), blaming the people (the masses are backward), blaming this and blaming that, but never blaming themselves. Later, through repeated study of Chairman Mao's philosophical works, linking it with thought and practice, the county party committee further realized that the main reason was that they had not diligently stationed themselves according to the teachings of "On Practice."
    In the past, some members of the Xingzi County Party Committee had also gone down to station themselves at points. However, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of stationing, some people "were in the point, but their hearts were in the office," and floated up after only a few days. This kind of "stationing" was actually only licking the "pear skin," and did not truly "eat it personally" as Chairman Mao taught. Because the county party committee had little first-hand information and did not have a thorough understanding of the situation, it could not grasp the main contradictions. It relied solely on superficial understanding from cursory inspections and materials from reports to analyze problems, guide work, and lead production. As a result, it did not hit the mark, and every year was the old yield and the old look.
    Why couldn't they stay stationed? Practice made the county party committee realize that there were practical problems and ideological problems, but mainly ideological problems, that is, they had not mastered "On Practice." These comrades often regarded stationing merely as a working method. Since it was a method, they felt that they could do it this way or that way. Later, through repeated study of "On Practice," combined with positive examples, the county party committee increasingly realized that stationing was not simply a matter of working methods, but a major issue of world outlook, a major issue of revolution and non-revolution. Therefore, in 1965, the county party committee decided to station itself, and expanded the original key point teams into running three model communes. Communes and brigades also ran their own models, layer by layer, level by level, with key points. Leading cadres, especially the top leaders, were determined to go down and implement the "three-way combination" of leadership, the masses, and technicians, and gradually explore, understand, and master the laws of the three major revolutionary movements through labor.
    Where to Start Grasping Balanced Production Increase?
    Xingzi County had three "800-jin communes" and many "1000-jin production teams" as early as 1963, but the yields of different communes, teams, and fields varied greatly, with some exceeding 1000 jin and others only 100 or 200 jin. The so-called "three laggards" (lagging fields, lagging teams, and lagging people) held back the entire county.
    To grasp contradictions, one must grasp the main contradiction; to grasp the main contradiction, one must grasp the main aspect of the contradiction, especially the transformation of the contradiction. In the situation where the county had "800-jin communes" and "1000-jin production teams" while also having mu yields of only 100 or 200 jin, turning the "three laggards" into "three advanced," turning the "draggers" into "locomotives," was the main contradiction for large-scale and substantial production increase, and the main aspect of the current contradiction. When selecting points to create models in 1965, the county party committee decided to take this step. However, some people advocated selecting areas with good conditions, high yields, and small areas to create models, believing that these areas would be easy to improve and could be reliably turned into models; selecting areas with poor conditions, low yields, and large areas to create models was feared to be unable to improve and not be able to become models. In reality, they were afraid of hardship and losing face. The county party committee criticized this cowardly thinking lacking revolutionary spirit, emphasized that they must abandon all personal thoughts, and must be revolutionary vanguards; and decided that, in addition to selecting Aikou Commune, which had the most cold-water and rotten-mud fields and the heaviest labor burden, in the semi-mountainous and hilly areas, and Liaohua Commune, which had the most sand mountains and the most deficient natural fertilizer sources, in the lakeside hilly areas to create models, it would also select Guanchiao Commune, which had the worst conditions, the weakest foundation, the lowest yield, and was known for its backwardness, to create a model.
    After the model points were determined, the county party committee transferred one-third of the "elite troops" from the county's cadres, led by the main responsible comrades of the county party committee, to form model work teams, plunging directly to the bottom and stationing in the production teams. The excellent situation in Guanchiao Commune, where cadres and masses urgently demanded to revolutionize backwardness, was about to erupt.
    The mental state of the people in Guanchiao Commune changed, the production outlook changed, and when the early rice showed a scene of bumper harvest, the county party committee timely organized cadres and members from various places to visit here. Everyone looked on the spot, compared on the spot, and discussed on the spot, with their eyes reddened and their hearts pounding, unable to sit or stand still. High-yield units that used to put on airs of being "the best," were extremely nervous because the formerly most backward units had caught up, "stepping on their heels"; units with conditions similar to or slightly better than Guanchiao Commune were even more anxious; and those units that were "not as good as the best, but better than the worst" could not sit still either. Hechun Commune had always thought that its conditions were poor and that it had a large area of low-yield fields, so achieving high yields was like "force-feeding a short-legged pig"—limited. When they saw that the cadres and masses of Guanchiao Commune were increasing fertilizer and improving soil with revolutionary spirit, and were fully confident of achieving 800 jin, they no longer said that their conditions were poor, but instead rushed to catch up, taking Guanchiao as an example in everything, closely following every step, not giving way in any way, fearing to fall behind. Liaonan Commune saw that Liaohua Commune, which had worse conditions, larger area, and lower yield in previous years, had really caught up, and was in a great posture to surpass them, no longer said that their production had "reached the top," but instead looked for gaps, tapped potential, took measures, and strove for higher yields.
    In 1965, grasping backwardness greatly promoted the county's large-scale and substantial balanced increase in production. The county's average grain yield per mu increased by more than 57 percent compared to last year.
    The practice of grasping backwardness in building model fields gave the county party committee a great inspiration: Under certain circumstances, it is far from enough to only grasp the advanced to lead the backward, but also to grasp the backward to promote the advanced. The attitude of bypassing backward areas, or covering up contradictions and "peacefully coexisting" with backward things is wrong. To grasp balanced production increase, one must start by grasping "backward fields, backward teams, and backward people." The contradiction between the advanced and the backward will transform into its opposite under certain conditions. We are engaged in revolution, and we must do the transformation work of contradictions. This requires struggle, revolutionary spirit, and a spirit of daring.
    What Kind of Spirit Should Model Building Embody?
    Examples are a great force. The Xingzi County Party Committee believes that the purpose of establishing models is to build a base for the three major revolutionary movements, to create a path for building a new socialist countryside with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to provide a demonstration and direction for the people of the county. However, they also believe that there is much to be said about how to build models and what kind of spirit to establish.
    The Xingzi County Party Committee's understanding comes from practice. In 1964, the Xingzi County Party Committee focused on summarizing and popularizing the high-yield experience of two model production teams, one was the experience of the fifth production team of the Dongxing Brigade of the Hengtang Commune, whose grain yield per mu exceeded 1000 jin, and the other was the experience of the seventh production team of the Xingxing Brigade of the Aikou Commune, which transformed low-yield fields and greatly increased grain production (from 100 jin per mu to 700 jin). Because the fifth production team of Dongxing ate "special meals" (preferential fertilizer); while the seventh production team of Xingxing followed the Dazhai road, not wanting state loans, nor preferential fertilizer, relying on self-reliance to accumulate and create fertilizer, and relying on "iron shoulders" to work hard, therefore, the visitors had obviously different views on them. Everyone said that the fifth production team of Dongxing was "a flower on the spot, with fertilizer as the mainstay, beautiful but not easy to learn"; the seventh production team of Xingxing was "iron shoulders are strong, beautiful and easy to learn."
    These vivid facts made the county party committee further understand the principle that "the internal cause is the basis of change, and the external cause acts through the internal cause." Building models that "eat special meals" and are "specialized" is engaging in external causation, and lacks the most vitality. Only by acting according to the law that "the fundamental cause of the development of things is not outside the things, but inside the things," and engaging in self-reliance, hard struggle, and Dazhai-style models, can we be the most persuasive and achieve the purpose of building models. Therefore, the county party committee in 1965 emphasized the correct handling of the relationship between self-reliance and external assistance from the very beginning of building models, and resolutely took the road of self-reliance.
    Over the past year, the county party committee has always adhered to relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to build models, and has handled water conservancy investment, agricultural loans, and fertilizer distribution for the three model communes in accordance with policies. The county party committee emphasized highlighting politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a lively way, and doing a good job in the work of people; emphasized strengthening the construction of rural party branches; and emphasized farming for the revolution and farming with revolutionary spirit. After doing this, these model communes and teams, following the Dazhai road, were high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. In the model points at all levels, they repaired water conservancy themselves if it was not good, accumulated fertilizer themselves if fertilizer was insufficient, changed seeds themselves if seeds were bad, and raised funds themselves if funds were insufficient. The experience they created was visible, tangible, and learnable.
    The revolutionary spirit of the model points encouraged and promoted the vast number of cadres and masses in the county to fight tenaciously against nature and win a bumper harvest. Jiaodong Commune had long wanted to build a three-stage 400-horsepower pumping station. They waited for state investment and waited for external support, waiting for three full years without building it. In 1965, under the encouragement of the revolutionary spirit of the model points, they carried forward the Dazhai spirit, raised funds themselves, raised labor themselves, and completed the station construction plan in one fell swoop, making all 4,700 mu of paddy fields in the commune fully irrigated by gravity.
    Practice has made the Xingzi County Party Committee deeply realize that only by relying on the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, and making the external cause play a role through the internal cause, can such a model have vitality. Therefore, to build models, one must first establish the Dazhai revolutionary spirit.
    What Should be Grasped in Combining Points and Areas?
    The purpose of building models is to create advanced experience, popularize advanced experience, and turn advanced points into advanced areas. How can this be achieved? Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a lively way, the Xingzi County Party Committee further realized: it is not enough to be superstitious about the influence of points and to remain at the level of general appeals. For example, if the points do not eat special meals and develop production by relying on the Dazhai spirit, will it have an impact on the general areas? Of course, it has an impact. However, this impact will not naturally play a significant role. Without solid and meticulous ideological and organizational work, the advanced ideas and advanced experience of the points cannot take root in the areas; especially in some backward areas, without hard and in-depth work to make the external cause play a role through the internal cause, the things of the points cannot penetrate. Therefore, in 1965, the Xingzi County Party Committee combined stationing and building models with carrying out the comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing campaign, and put great efforts into the words "lead" and "promote," which achieved very good results.
    In stationing and leading the comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing campaign, the Xingzi County Party Committee also grasped promoting the points through areas, the method was to make a fuss about the word "surpass." Because the areas compared with the "points," learned from the "points," and caught up with the "points," especially focusing on "surpassing" the points, the areas were not always following the points' butts, being cold and clear, loose and undisciplined, and making little progress; but instead were self-reliant and striving for the upstream. In this way, the advanced points would not dare to "close the door and claim to be the king," but would instead humbly learn from the advanced experience of the areas. As a result, the points and areas formed a competition network of mutual catching up and mutual surpassing, making the competition heat wave of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing higher and higher. This made the Xingzi County Party Committee realize that it is very important to correctly handle the problem of combining points and areas. One must not only station in the points, but also not get trapped in the points; one must not only take care of the overall situation, but also not float on the surface; one must not only lead the areas with the points, but also promote the points with the areas. Under the current conditions, one must especially grasp the word "surpass." This is a key to making advanced experience blossom everywhere.
    Through these facts, the Xingzi County Party Committee realized that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a lively way, and doing everything in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, truly going deep down to station and build models, carrying hoes and sweating with poor and lower-middle peasants, is the best way to transform the objective world and also transform the subjective world. Only in this way can we truly cultivate proletarian feelings, can we give play to the revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties and not fearing hardship, and can we truly combine the general and the individual, theory and practice, and the top and the bottom.

    扎扎实实地蹲点办样板
    ——江西星子县委在蹲点过程中怎样处理各种关系问题
    一九六五年，中共江西省星子县委会通过反复学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》，在领导农业生产中，按照毛主席的指示，认真改变领导思想和领导作风，扎实地蹲点办样板；在蹲点过程中，又按照毛主席的思想，处理一系列的关系问题，使全县获得大面积平衡增产，粮食平均亩产量第一次跨过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    县委在总结一九六五年的工作时，深深体会到：“读毛主席的书，多读多进步，少读少进步，不读不进步；听毛主席的话，全听全增产，半听半增产，不听不增产。”
    改变生产面貌从哪里改起？
    县委的总结，首先回顾了他们改变领导思想领导方法的起因。
    中共星子县委老早就想使全县粮食平均亩产量达到和超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。可是一年又一年都没有实现。原因在哪里？过去有一些人，往往把账记在客观头上，怪天（非涝即旱），怪地（山高水冷），怪人（群众落后），怪这怪那，就是不怪自己。后来县委通过反复学习毛主席的哲学著作，联系思想，联系实际，才进一步认识到，主要应当怪自己没有按照《实践论》、《矛盾论》的教导去认真蹲点。
    过去，星子县委也有些人下去蹲过点。但是，由于对蹲点的意义认识不足，有些人，“身在点里，心在机关”，没有蹲几天就浮起来。这样“蹲点”，实际上是只舔了“梨皮”，并没象毛主席所教导的那样真正“亲口吃一吃”。正因县委掌握的第一手资料少，情况吃不透，抓不住主要矛盾，单凭着走马观花的一知半解和听汇报的材料来分析问题，指导工作，领导生产，结果，打不到点子上，年年是老产量、老面貌。
    为什么蹲不下去？实践使县委认识到，有实际问题，也有思想问题，但主要是思想问题，也就是没有把《实践论》学到家。这些同志往往把蹲点仅仅看成是一种工作方法，既然是方法，就觉得可以这样做，也可以那样做。后来通过反复学习《实践论》，结合正面事例反复研究，县委越来越体会到，蹲点不单纯是工作方法问题，而是世界观的大问题，是革命与不革命的大问题。因此，一九六五年县委便决心蹲点，把原来蹲重点队发展为办三个样板公社，公社、大队也办了自己的样板，层层办样板，级级有重点，领导干部特别是第一把手下狠心蹲下去，实行领导、群众、技术员“三结合”，通过同劳动，逐步摸索、认识、掌握三大革命运动的规律。
    平衡增产从哪里抓起？
    星子县一九六三年就出现了三个“八百斤公社”和不少“千斤生产队”，可是社与社、队与队、田与田之间单产相差悬殊，高的超千斤，低的一、二百斤。所谓“三后进”（后进田、后进队、后进人）拖住了全县的脚。
    抓矛盾要抓主要矛盾，抓主要矛盾要抓矛盾的主要方面，特别是要抓矛盾的转化。在全县有了“八百斤公社”“千斤生产队”而同时又存在着亩产只一二百斤的情况下，把“三后进”变成“三先进”，把“拖脚的”变成“火车头”，就是大面积、大幅度增产的主要矛盾，就是当前矛盾的主要方面。县委在一九六五年选点办样板的时候，便决心走这一步棋。可是有的人却主张选条件好、产量高、面积小的地区办样板，他们认为这样的地区容易上去，有把握成为样板；选条件差、产量低、面积大的地区办样板，怕上不去，怕不能成其为样板。实际上是怕艰苦、怕丢面子。县委批判了这种缺乏革命精神的懦夫思想，强调一定要丢掉一切个人杂念，一定要做革命的闯将；并决定，除了在半山丘陵地区选择冷水烂泥田最多、劳力负担最重的隘口公社，和在滨湖丘陵地区选择沙山绵亘、自然肥源最缺的蓼花公社办样板以外，还选择全县条件最差、基础最薄、产量最低、落后出了名的公社——观桥公社办样板。
    样板点确定以后，县委从全县干部中抽调了三分之一的“精兵”，由县委主要负责同志分别带队，组成样板工作组，一竿子插到底，蹲在生产队。观桥公社的干部和群众迫切要求革落后的命的大好形势，一触即发。
    观桥公社人的精神状态变了，生产面貌变了，在早稻出现一派丰收景象时，县委及时组织各地干部、社员到这里来参观。大家就地看，就地比，就地议，眼红心跳，坐立不安。摆“老大”架子的高产单位，由于原来最落后的赶上来，“踩后脚跟”，紧张极了；条件与观桥公社相同或稍好的单位，更着慌了；那些“比上不足、比下有余”的单位，也坐不住了。河村公社一向认为自己条件差，低产田面积大，搞高产是“短脚猪催膘”——有限。当他们看到观桥公社的干部群众，以革命精神增肥改土，完全有把握实现八百斤的时候，再也不说自己的条件差了，而是急起猛追，处处以观桥为榜样，步步紧跟，一着不让，唯恐掉队。蓼南公社看到条件比自己差，面积比自己大，历年产量比自己低的蓼花公社真的赶上来了，并大有超过之势，再也不说自己生产“到了顶”，而是找差距、挖潜力、采取措施、夺取更高产。
    一九六五年由于狠抓后进，大大促进了全县大面积、大幅度平衡增产。全县粮食平均亩产量比去年增长百分之五十七以上。
    在办样板田中狠抓后进的实践，给了县委很大启发：在一定情况下，光抓先进带后进是很不够的，还要抓后进促先进。那种绕开后进地区走，或者掩盖矛盾、同落后的东西“和平共处”的态度是错误的。要抓平衡增产，就必须从狠抓“后进田、后进队、后进人”抓起。先进和后进的矛盾，在一定条件下会向自己的对立面转化。我们干革命，就是要做矛盾的转化工作。这就需要斗争，需要有革命精神，需要一股闯劲。
    树样板要树什么精神？
    榜样是伟大的力量。星子县委认为，树立样板的目的是建设三大革命运动的根据地，闯出一条多快好省建设社会主义新农村的道路来，为全县人民作出示范，指明方向。但是，他们又认为，样板怎样树，要树立起什么精神，却大有文章。
    星子县委的这个体会是从实践中得来的。一九六四年星子县委重点总结推广了两个样板生产队的高产经验，一个是横塘公社东升大队第五生产队粮食亩产超千斤的经验，一个是隘口公社星星大队第七生产队改造低产田粮食大幅度增产（亩产由一百斤增至七百斤）的经验。由于东升第五生产队吃了“小灶”
  （优待化肥）；而星星第七生产队走大寨之路，一不要国家贷款，二不要优待化肥，自力更生积肥造肥，靠“铁肩膀”硬干，因而前往参观的人，对他们的看法显然不同。大家说，东升第五生产队是“点上一枝花，化肥来当家，好看不好学”；星星第七生产队是“铁肩膀过得硬，好看又好学。”
    这些生动的事实，使县委进一步懂得了“内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用”的道理。办“吃小灶”、“特殊化”的样板，是搞外因论，最缺乏生命力。只有按照“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部”的规律办事，搞自力更生、艰苦奋斗、大寨式的样板，才最有说服力，才能达到搞样板的目的。因此，县委一九六五年办样板，一开始就强调正确处理好自力更生与外援的关系，坚决走自力更生的道路。
    一年来，县委始终坚持了靠毛泽东思想，靠党的政策来办样板，对三个样板公社，在水利投资、农业贷款、化肥分配方面，都是按政策办事。县委强调突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，做好人的工作；强调加强农村党支部的建设；强调为革命种田，用革命精神种田。这样做了以后，这些样板社、队，走大寨之路，意气风发，斗志昂扬。各级的样板点上，都是水利不好自己修，肥料不足自己积，种子不良自己换，资金不足自己筹。他们创造的经验，看得见，摸得着，学得到。
    样板点上的革命精神，鼓舞、推动了全县广大干部和群众顽强地与自然开战，夺取丰收。蛟东公社早就想建一座三级四百马力的抽水机站，他们等国家投资、等外地支援，足足等了三年都没有建成，一九六五年在样板点上的革命精神鼓舞下，发扬了大寨精神，自筹资金，自筹劳力，一举完成了建站计划，使全社四千七百亩水田全部自流灌溉。
    实践使星子县委深深认识到，只有靠艰苦奋斗，自力更生精神，使外因通过内因而起作用，这样的样板才有生命力。因此，树样板，必须首先树大寨的革命精神。
   点面结合要抓什么？
    办样板的目的，是创造先进经验，推广先进经验，把先进的点变成先进的面。怎样才能做到这一点呢？星子县委通过活学活用毛主席著作，进一步体会到：迷信点上的影响、停留在一般号召上是不行的。象点上不吃小灶，靠大寨精神发展生产，对一般面上有没有影响？当然有影响。可是这种影响并不会自然而然发生很大的作用，不做扎实细致的思想工作和组织工作，点上的先进思想、先进经验就不可能在面上扎根；特别是一些后进地区，不经过艰苦深入的工作，使外因通过内因起作用，点上的东西就渗透不进去。因此，一九六五年星子县委就把蹲点办样板同开展比学赶帮超运动结合起来，在“带”字和
  “推”字上狠下功夫，收到了很好的效果。
    星子县委在蹲点领导比学赶帮超运动中，还狠抓以面促点，办法是在“超”上做文章。由于面上比“点”、学“点”、赶“点”，特别着重“超”点，面上就不是老是跟着点的屁股转，冷冷清清，松松垮垮，起色不大；而是自力更生，力争上游。这样一来，先进的点，也就不敢“关门称霸王”，而是虚心学习面上的先进经验，结果，就使点上和面上，形成了一个互赶互超的竞赛网，使比学赶帮超竞赛热潮一浪高一浪。这使星子县委体会到，正确处理点面结合问题很重要。既要蹲在点里，又不能陷在点里；既要照顾全面，又不能浮在面上；既要以点带面，又要以面促点。在目前条件下，特别要抓一个“超”字。这是使先进经验遍地开花的一个关键。
    通过这些事实，星子县委认识到，活学活用毛主席著作，事事处处按照毛主席的指示办事，真正深入下去蹲点办样板，同贫农下中农一起扛锄流汗，是改造客观世界，也是改造主观世界的最好办法。只有这样，才能真正锻炼培养无产阶级感情，才能发挥不怕困难、不怕苦的革命精神，才能真正使一般和个别、理论和实际、上头和下头结合起来。
