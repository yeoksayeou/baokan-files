    Japanese Professor Mekada Praises Our Young Generation
    China is the Most Vibrant Country in the World
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th) Japanese Kyushu University Professor Makoto Mekada recently published an article in the "Japan-China Cultural Exchange" newspaper praising the new generation cultivated by New China. He said, "China, once called the world's aging power, has now become the most vibrant young country in the world. China's charm is the charm of youth, overflowing with youthful vitality."
    Mekada said that during his travels in China, he saw outstanding young men and women everywhere, holding the ideal of building the motherland and dedicating all their strength to serving society.
    Mekada said that the Chinese youth he came into contact with, whether they were young commune leaders in the people's communes or young female narrators in museums and memorial halls everywhere, were all "spirited," "amiable," "simple and modest," and full of "confidence."
    Mekada said that what attracted his attention most was the life of Chinese university students. He said that Chinese universities do not cultivate privileged intellectuals, but cultivate laborers with scientific knowledge. Chinese university students also spend a certain amount of time each year participating in labor in rural areas and factories. Mekada also described the scene he saw when he visited Nanjing University, where a group of students happily built houses together with construction workers. He said that after graduating, Chinese university students, according to the needs of the country, with lofty ideals, go to the border areas and to any place in the motherland to participate in national construction.

    日本教授目加田赞扬我年青的一代
    中国是世界上最富有生气的国家
    据新华社东京九日电  日本九州大学教授目加田诚在最近一期《日中文化交流》报上发表文章赞扬新中国培养起来的年青一代。他说，“曾经被人们称为世界衰老大国的中国，如今已经成为世界上最富有生气的年青国家。中国的魅力，是青春的魅力，她洋溢着青春的活力。”
    目加田说，他在中国旅行期间，到处看到非常出色的男女青年，他们抱着建设祖国的理想，拿出全副力量为社会服务。
    目加田说，他所接触的中国青年，无论是人民公社的年青社长，或是各地博物馆、纪念馆的年青的女讲解员，个个都“精神焕发”，“态度和蔼”，“朴素而谦虚”，而且充满着“信心”。
    目加田说，最引起他注意的是中国大学生的生活。他说，中国的大学不是培养享有特权的知识分子，而是培养具有科学知识的劳动者。中国的大学生每年还要抽出一定的时间到农村和工厂参加劳动。目加田还介绍了他到南京大学去访问时，看到一群学生同建筑工人一起愉快地修建房屋的劳动景象。他说，中国的大学生毕业后根据国家的需要，抱着远大的理想，到边疆，到祖国的任何地方去参加国家建设。
