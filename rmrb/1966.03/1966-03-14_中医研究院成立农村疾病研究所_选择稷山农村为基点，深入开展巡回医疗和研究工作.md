    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, the Chinese Academy of Traditional Medicine recently established a research institute specializing in the study of rural diseases. The basic tasks of this research institute are to conduct rural health work, cultivate rural health personnel, collect, organize, and study the experiences of farmers in combating diseases, and carry out research on the prevention and treatment of rural diseases.
    This research institute has selected rural Jishan County, Shanxi Province, as its base to deeply carry out mobile medical treatment and research on the prevention and treatment of rural diseases. In the past two months, nearly a hundred personnel from traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine have gone deep into production teams to prevent and treat diseases for farmers, delivering medicine and medical care to their doors. They also used rural markets to organize "Ulanmuqi"-style propaganda teams to carry out health propaganda activities, and set up "stalls" in the markets to sell medicine and treat diseases. In addition, medical staff at this research institute have also opened acupuncture training classes and on-the-job health worker training classes.
    While providing mobile medical treatment, they also helped the local health department summarize the experience of integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine to carry out rural health work. They also conducted fieldwork, learning from local traditional Chinese medicine practitioners massage for children and treatment methods for more than a dozen diseases such as nephritis and whooping cough, accumulating some data for future research work.

    中医研究院成立农村疾病研究所
    选择稷山农村为基点，深入开展巡回医疗和研究工作
    据新华社十三日讯　中医研究院不久前建立了一所专门研究农村疾病的研究所。这个研究所的基本任务是，通过开展农村卫生工作，培养农村卫生人员，搜集整理和研究农民同疾病斗争的经验，开展防治农村疾病的研究工作。
    这个研究所已选择山西省稷山县农村为基点，深入开展巡回医疗和研究防治农村疾病的工作。两个月来已有近百名中医、中药人员，深入生产队为农民防病、治病，送药送医上门。他们还利用农村集市，组织“乌兰牧骑”式的宣传队，开展卫生宣传活动，并在集市上“摆摊子”卖药和治病。此外，这个研究所的医护人员还开设了针灸训练班、不脱产卫生员训练班。
    他们在巡回医疗的同时，还帮助当地卫生部门总结了中西医结合开展农村卫生工作的经验，并开展采风活动，向当地中医学习小儿推拿和肾炎、百日咳等十几种病的治疗方法，为今后开展研究工作积累了一些资料。
