    Building it themselves, Improving Living Conditions
    A Batch of Li and Miao Commune Members on Hainan Island Move into New Tile-Roofed Houses
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th. Recently, another 2,500 Li and Miao commune member households in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have moved into new homes. Now, more than 9,000 Li and Miao commune member households here have moved into new tile-roofed houses.
    Before liberation, the vast majority of the Li and Miao people lived in small, dark, and damp boat-shaped thatched huts. In particular, the Miao people here have never had a settled dwelling since ancient times. When typhoons and rainstorms hit, the houses and furniture of many people were often swept away by mountain floods. After liberation, with the development of production, the living standards of the Li and Miao commune members have continuously improved. In 1962, commune members began to build tile-roofed houses to improve their living conditions. When building tile-roofed houses, all localities conscientiously implemented the principle of "self-reliance as the mainstay, state subsidies as a supplement," relying on the masses of commune members, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials. The vast majority of communes and teams made lime and bricks themselves, continuously reducing the cost of housing construction.
    These newly built tile-roofed houses are spacious and bright, and are very popular among the Li and Miao commune members. Many commune members who have moved into new houses hang portraits of Chairman Mao in the center of the walls, sincerely thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    自己动手，改善居住条件
    海南岛一批黎族苗族社员住上新瓦房
    新华社广州十一日电　海南黎族苗族自治州最近又有二千五百户黎族和苗族社员搬进了新居。现在这里已有九千多户黎族和苗族社员住上了新瓦房。
    解放前，这里绝大部分黎族、苗族人民住的都是矮小、阴暗、潮湿的船形茅屋。特别是这里的苗族人民，自古以来没有定居，碰上台风暴雨，不少人的房屋、家具常被山洪卷走。解放后，随着生产的发展，黎族、苗族社员的生活水平不断提高。一九六二年，社员开始兴建瓦房，改善居住条件。各地在兴建瓦房时，认真贯彻“自力更生为主，国家补助为辅”的方针，依靠社员群众，因地制宜，就地取材。绝大部分社队自己动手烧石灰、烧砖瓦，使民房造价不断降低。
    新建的这些瓦房，宽大明亮，很受黎族、苗族社员欢迎。好多住上了新房的社员把毛主席象挂在屋墙中央，衷心地感谢共产党和毛主席。
