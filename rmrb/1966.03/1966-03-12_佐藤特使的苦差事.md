    Special Envoy Sato's Thankless Task

    The Japanese Sato government, which supports U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam, has been thrown into a very embarrassing situation in recent days by a "slip of the tongue" by its special envoy, Yokoyama.

    Special Envoy Yokoyama was dispatched abroad by the Sato government to peddle the U.S.-manufactured "peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue" fraud. However, upon arriving in Paris, Special Envoy Yokoyama made a statement saying, "I personally believe that the South Vietnamese government is merely a puppet government of the United States."

    According to Japanese newspapers, Yokoyama's statement "caused a flurry of anxiety and unease within the 'Foreign Ministry' of the Japanese government." Foreign Minister Shiina "immediately" issued a "directive" to Special Envoy Yokoyama, ordering him to quickly report his statements during the interview with Japanese reporters to the "Foreign Ministry" and warning him to "exercise caution in his words and actions in the future and not to speak rashly."

    It is not at all surprising that Yokoyama's statement caused great consternation within the Japanese "Foreign Ministry." The reason why the Japanese government dispatched Yokoyama as its special envoy was to have him, in accordance with the wishes of the United States, lobby some countries, especially Asian and African countries, to serve the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese government not only attempted to use Special Envoy Yokoyama's activities to peddle the Johnson administration's "peace talks" conspiracy everywhere, slander and undermine the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation, but also to promote Japan's so-called "independent diplomacy," creating the impression that the Japanese government was adopting a "stable diplomatic posture approaching the non-aligned route, in order to enhance Japan's voice in Asian and African countries."

    However, the task that the Japanese government entrusted to Special Envoy Yokoyama is impossible for any such "special envoy" to complete.

    Asian, African, and other countries around the world can see clearly that the Sato government is closely following the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war, and that there is no such thing as "independent diplomacy." It openly slanders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an "aggressor" and openly supports, and in fact participates in, the criminal war of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. When the United States resumed bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the end of January this year, Sato even said, "If the United States is to stop bombing, the aggression from the North must stop."

    Not only that, but now the Sato government is also inviting Nguyen Cao Ky, the head of the South Vietnamese puppet clique, a running dog of U.S. imperialism, to visit Japan in the near future in order to further strengthen Japan's direct collusion with the South Vietnamese puppet clique.

    Since the facts are as such, no matter how desperately the Sato government carries out its so-called "Asia-Africa diplomacy," and no matter how capable its dispatched special envoys are, it cannot deceive Asian and African countries into trusting it. From this point of view, Special Envoy Yokoyama of the Sato government is indeed undertaking a thankless task.

    The Sato government wants to wholeheartedly serve as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time raise the banner of so-called "independent diplomacy" and "Asia-Africa diplomacy" to deceive world public opinion. How can this be done? After Yokoyama carried out the Sato government's instructions to serve the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" fraud, he said a sentence that acknowledged the facts, simply to boast about Japan's so-called "independent diplomacy" and "Asia-Africa diplomacy." However, as soon as the words left his mouth, he exposed the festering sore of U.S. imperialism, causing a great uproar, and thus making the Sato government both laugh and cry, and become utterly flustered.

    The Yokoyama "slip of the tongue" incident completely exposed the hypocrisy of the Sato government's so-called "Asia-Africa diplomacy" and "independent diplomacy." It is truly a case of the Sato government being hoisted by its own petard.

### 佐藤特使的苦差事

    佐藤特使的苦差事
    支持美帝国主义侵略越南战争的日本佐藤政府，最近几天来被它的特使横山的一次“失言”弄得十分狼狈。
    横山特使是佐藤政府为了兜售美国制造的“和平解决越南问题”骗局而派出国外进行活动的。但是，横山特使到了巴黎却发表谈话说：“我个人认为南越政府不过是美国的傀儡政府而已”。
    据日本报纸报道，横山的这次谈话，在日本政府的“外务省中引起了一阵慌张不安。”外务大臣椎名“立即”向横山特使发出“训令”，命令他赶快把接见日本记者时的发言向“外务省”报告，并且警告说，“今后言行必须谨慎，不可轻率发言”。
    横山的这次发言使得日本“外务省”大大着慌，这是丝毫不足奇怪的。日本政府之所以派出横山这位特使，就是要他遵照美国的意旨，向一些国家，特别是向亚非国家进行游说，为美国侵略越南的政策效劳。据日本报纸透露，日本政府不仅企图通过横山特使的活动到处推销约翰逊政府的“和谈”阴谋，诬蔑和破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争，又要宣扬日本的所谓“自主外交”，做出一种似乎日本政府在“向不结盟路线接近的、稳健的外交姿态，以便提高日本在亚非各国的发言权”。
    但是，日本政府交给横山特使的这个任务，是任何这类“特使”都无法完成的。
    亚非各国和世界各国都看得清清楚楚，佐藤政府是紧紧地追随着美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的，根本没有什么“自主外交”。它公然诬蔑越南民主共和国是“侵略者”，公开支持、而且实际上也参与了美帝国主义侵略越南的罪恶战争。当美国在今年一月末恢复轰炸越南民主共和国的时候，佐藤竟然说什么：“如果要美国停止轰炸，必须停止来自北方的侵略”。
    不仅如此。现在，佐藤政府还邀请美帝国主义的走狗南越傀儡集团头子阮高其在最近时期内访问日本，以便进一步加强日本同南越傀儡集团的直接勾结。
    事实既然如此，那么不管佐藤政府怎样拼命地开展它的所谓“亚非外交”，不管它派出的特使怎样能干，都无法骗取亚非国家对它的信任。从这一点上来说，佐藤政府的特使横山确确实实是担当了一个苦差事。
    佐藤政府既要死心塌地地充当美帝国主义的帮凶，又要打起所谓“自主外交”和“亚非外交”的旗号来欺骗世界舆论，这怎么能够办得到呢？横山在执行佐藤政府的指令为美帝国主义“和谈”骗局效劳之后，说了一句承认事实的话，无非是想标榜一下日本的所谓“自主外交”和“亚非外交”。但是，话刚出口，就揭了美帝国主义的烂疮疤，引起了轩然大波，因而使得佐藤政府哭笑不得，狼狈周章。
    横山“失言”事件，完全暴露了佐藤政府所标榜的什么“亚非外交”和“自主外交”的虚伪性。佐藤政府这样丑态毕露，实在是自作自受。　　本报记者　陈泊微
