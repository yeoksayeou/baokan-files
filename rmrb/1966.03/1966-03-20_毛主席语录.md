    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    We Communists are like seeds and the people are like the soil. When we get to a place, we must integrate ourselves with the people there, take root and blossom among them. Wherever our comrades go, they must have good relations with the masses, care for them, and help them solve their difficulties. Unite the broad masses of the people, the more the better. 《On the Chongqing Negotiations》

    毛主席语录
    我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。我们的同志不论到什么地方，都要和群众的关系搞好，要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难。团结广大人民，团结得越多越好。     《关于重庆谈判》
