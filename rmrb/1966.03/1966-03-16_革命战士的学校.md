    Revolutionary Warriors' School
    He Zhuo
    War is a school. People's war is a school that nurtures thousands upon thousands of people's warriors. The South Vietnam battlefield is precisely such a large university.
    This school has two kinds of teachers. One is the positive teacher, which is the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. The other is the negative teacher, which is U.S. imperialism.
    The war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam was for the purpose of permanently occupying South Vietnam, and also to gain experience in suppressing national liberation movements. In the words of U.S. imperialism, it was to use South Vietnam as a "testing ground" for "counter-guerrilla warfare." However, things went contrary to its wishes. As a result, it did not find, nor could it possibly find, any way to deal with people's war, while the South Vietnamese people, step by step, learned how to deal with U.S. imperialism from this large university, developed the skills to kill the enemy and win victory, and cultivated batch after batch of outstanding students.
    Not long ago, the Political Bureau of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces warmly commended Zhang Wenhe, the "U.S.-Annihilating Hero" of Quang Nam Province. Zhang Wenhe is only twenty-four years old. In the four months of the latter half of last year, he wiped out one hundred and fifty-four enemies, including seventy-eight American aggressors. Zhang Wenhe is one of the thousands upon thousands of outstanding students who were trained in this school.
    "U.S.-Annihilating Heroes" like Zhang Wenhe are not isolated cases on the South Vietnam battlefield. Thirteen-year-old Duan Wenlian killed fourteen American aggressors with grenades; female guerrilla leader Wu Shimo eliminated twenty-six American soldiers; landmine king Chang Gui killed seventy-five American soldiers. In Cu Chi district of South Vietnam alone, ninety-seven soldiers were awarded the title of "U.S.-Annihilating Hero." There are many similar cases in other parts of South Vietnam as well.
    The experiences of Zhang Wenhe and other South Vietnamese people's warriors show that, first of all, it is the people, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and the South Vietnam Liberation Army who nurtured them. Secondly, we cannot deny the indispensable role played by the American aggressors.
    The South Vietnamese people's warriors' hatred for the enemy was created by U.S. imperialism. The U.S. invading forces stormed into South Vietnam, killing and setting fires, arousing boundless hatred among the South Vietnamese people. This is national hatred, class hatred, and personal hatred. With this kind of hatred, we can generate a high degree of political consciousness and unparalleled courage, and become a huge spiritual factor in defeating the American aggressors, which can also be transformed into a great and invincible material force.
    The strong confidence of the South Vietnamese people's warriors that the American aggressors can be defeated was established after actual contests with them. One does not know each other without a fight. Through the practice of fighting, they came to know the details of the American aggressors. Zhang Wenhe killed three American bandits in his first battle, and from then on he came to the conclusion: "The American devils are not scary." This is a leap in understanding, and also a new starting point. Countless South Vietnamese people's warriors have gone through such a leap, and from this new starting point are marching towards greater victories.
    The various methods created by the South Vietnamese people's warriors to annihilate the enemy were also learned in practice. They went from having no weapons, to seizing weapons and manufacturing their own; from not knowing how to use weapons, to learning how to use them, to the point of bringing the power of weapons into play to an astonishing degree; from using one method, to using a variety of flexible and mobile tactics to strike at the enemy. The road traveled by the South Vietnamese people's warriors is a common road that all revolutionary people have already taken and will continue to take.
    Of course, U.S. imperialism is absolutely unwilling to accept defeat, and it is determined to continue fighting in South Vietnam. That is to say, it wants to continue running this war school, and to run it bigger and bigger. In other words, the American aggressors want to continue to act as unpaid and obligatory negative teachers. The result can only be to train more "U.S.-Annihilating Heroes" for the South Vietnamese people, to train more people's warriors, until the American aggressors are all drowned in the vast ocean of people's war.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "War educates the people, and the people will win the war." The South Vietnamese people have been educated and tempered in this great school of war, have learned war, and will win the final victory in this war against the American aggressors.

    革命战士的学校
    何卓
    战争，是一所学校。人民战争，是培育千千万万人民战士的学校。南越战场，就是这样一所大学校。
    这所学校有两种教员。一种是正面教员，这就是越南南方民族解放阵线。另一种是反面教员，这就是美帝国主义。
    美帝国主义在南越发动的侵略战争，是为了永久霸占南越，也是为了取得镇压民族解放运动的经验。用美帝国主义的话来说，就是要把南越作为一个“反游击战”的“试验场”。但是，事与愿违。结果是，它没有找到也不可能找到对付人民战争的任何办法，而南越人民却从这所大学校中，一步一步地学会了对付美帝国主义的办法，练成了杀敌致胜的本领，培养了一批又一批的成绩优异的学生。
    不久以前，越南南方解放武装力量政治局热烈表彰了广南省的“歼美勇士”张文和。张文和只有二十四岁。他在去年下半年的四个月内，就消灭了一百五十四个敌人，其中有七十八个美国侵略者，张文和就是在这个学校中锻炼出来的千千万万个优秀生中的一个。
    象张文和这样的“歼美勇士”，在南越战场上并不是个别的。十三岁的段文练，用手榴弹炸死了十四个美国侵略者；女游击组长武士模消灭了二十六个美军；地雷大王长瑰炸死美军七十五名。仅仅在南越的古芝县就有九十七个战士荣获“歼美勇士”称号。在南越的其它地方，同样有很多。
    张文和和其他南越人民战士成长的经历说明，首先是人民，是南越民族解放阵线，是南越解放军培养了他们。其次，我们也不能否认美国侵略者所起的不可缺少的作用。
    南越人民战士的对敌仇恨，是美帝国主义造成的。美国侵略军大举闯进南越，杀人放火，激起了南越人民的无比仇恨。这是民族的仇恨，阶级的仇恨，切身的仇恨。有了这种仇恨，就能产生高度的政治觉悟和无比的勇敢精神，就能成为打败美国侵略者的巨大精神因素，也就能转化成为战无不胜的伟大物质力量。
    南越人民战士认为可以打败美国侵略军的坚强信心，是经过同它实地较量以后建立起来的。不打不成相识。经过打的实践，就知道了美国侵略军的底细了。张文和第一次参加战斗就打死了三个美国强盗，从此他得出一个结论：“美国佬不可怕。”这是认识上的一个飞跃，也是一个新的起点。无数南越人民战士，都是经过这样一个飞跃，从这一新的起点走向更大胜利。
    南越人民战士创造的歼灭敌人的各种办法，也是在实践中学会的。他们从没有武器，到夺取武器和自己制造武器；从不会使用武器，到学会使用武器，以至把武器的威力发挥到惊人的地步；从运用一种办法，到运用多种多样、灵活机动的战术打击敌人。南越人民战士走过的这条道路，是一切革命人民已经走过和将要继续走的共同道路。
    当然，美帝国主义是绝不甘心失败的，它决心要在南越打下去。就是说，它要把这所战争的学校，继续办下去，并且越办越大。也就是说，美国侵略者要继续充当不拿薪水上义务课的反面教员。这样，其结果只能是为南越人民训练出更多的“歼美勇士”，训练出更多的人民战士，直到把美国侵略者通通淹死在人民战争的汪洋大海中。
    毛泽东同志说：“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争。”南越人民，就是这样从战争这所大学校中，受到了教育，得到了锻炼，学会了战争，并将赢得这场反对美国侵略者的战争的最后胜利。
