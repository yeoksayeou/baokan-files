    Disintegrating the puppet army is a major factor in achieving victory.
    The Rapidly Disintegrating South Vietnamese Puppet Army
    The puppet army of South Vietnam, regarded by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs as the pillar of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, is collapsing at an accelerating rate. According to reduced figures, in 1961, the first year that U.S. imperialism launched its "special warfare" in South Vietnam, 17,000 puppet soldiers deserted; this increased to 80,000 in 1964. According to a Reuters report on February 28, in 1965, the number of deserters in the puppet army increased to more than 113,000, an average of nearly 10,000 per month. The puppet soldiers who deserted already accounted for 17.8 percent of the total number of puppet soldiers.
    The rapid collapse of the South Vietnamese puppet army is primarily due to the heavy blows inflicted by the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces. Furthermore, more and more people in the puppet army have recognized the true face of the U.S. imperialist aggressors, abhor the traitorous crimes of the puppet clique, and refuse to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism, thus deserting the puppet army in large numbers. Among the deserters, it is noteworthy that an increasing number of puppet soldiers are defecting to the people with their weapons. Last year, in the central Trung Bo region alone, 19,634 puppet soldiers defected to the people, bringing 1,894 guns, 160,000 rounds of ammunition, and a large amount of other war materiel. It should be particularly pointed out that more puppet soldiers are taking collective action in platoons and companies, and after rising up to eliminate the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs, they are joining the Liberation Armed Forces with all their weapons.
    Due to the large numbers of puppet soldiers deserting and being killed or wounded, the puppet army is now facing a serious shortage of personnel. According to the Associated Press, "In many units, many soldiers are only nominally on the rolls. In some main force units, due to desertions and casualties, the number of soldiers is already 20 to 30 percent less than the authorized strength... even 50 percent less." Because of the continuous mass desertions of puppet soldiers, even though the U.S.-puppet group desperately recruits soldiers, they still find that those recruited today desert tomorrow, making it impossible to fill the vacancies.
    Not only that, but the remaining puppet soldiers are also extremely demoralized, afraid of fighting and doing everything possible to avoid it. For example, during the Dong Xoai campaign last June, when a puppet army unit stationed in Ben Cat was ordered to move out in support, some puppet soldiers cried out that they had headaches when the helicopters arrived to pick them up, some deliberately injured their feet and legs while carrying ammunition to avoid departure, and some burst into tears. The entire camp was a scene of misery.

    瓦解伪军是取得胜利的一个重大因素
    迅速瓦解中的南越伪军
    被美帝国主义及其走狗视为南越伪政权支柱的伪军，正在日益加速崩溃。根据缩小了的数字，一九六一年，即美帝国主义在南越发动“特种战争”的头一年，开小差逃跑的伪军为一万七千人；一九六四年增加至八万人。据路透社二月二十八日报道，在一九六五年，逃跑的伪军竟增加至十一万三千多人，即平均每月近一万人。开小差的伪军已占伪军总数百分之十七点八。
    南越伪军的迅速崩溃首先是由于遭到南越解放武装力量的沉重打击，加上伪军中有更多的人认清了美帝国主义侵略者的真面目，痛恨傀儡集团的卖国罪行，拒绝为美帝国主义充当炮灰，从而纷纷脱离伪军。在逃亡的伪军中，值得注意的一点是，愈来愈多的伪军是携械投向人民的。去年，仅在中部中区就有一万九千六百三十四个伪军，携带一千八百九十四枝枪、十六万发子弹和大批其他作战物资投向人民。特别应该指出的是，有更多伪军以排、连为单位集体行动，在奋起消灭美国侵略者及其走狗后，携带全部武器参加到解放武装力量方面来。
    由于大批伪军士兵逃跑和伤亡，以至现在伪军严重缺额。据美联社报道：“在许多单位，不少士兵只是在名单上徒具虚名。在一些主力部队，由于伪军逃跑和伤亡，士兵数目已比编制少了百分之二十至三十……甚至少百分之五十。”由于伪军连续大批逃亡，因此尽管美伪集团拼命抓兵，却仍然是今天抓来明天跑，补充不了所缺的空额。
    不仅如此，残存的伪军也是士气极度低落，害怕并千方百计逃避战斗。例如去年六月在东帅战役中，驻在边葛的一支伪军奉命出动支援，当接运他们的直升飞机一到，有些伪军就叫嚷头痛，有些在搬运弹药时故意压伤脚腿，以逃避出发，有些则嚎啕大哭。整个营地，一片悲惨景象。
