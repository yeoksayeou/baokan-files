    Floating Store
    [Miao] Shi Tairui
    On the Tuo River, a bamboo pole pushes a light boat,
    Small boats, sailing side by side in two rows,
    Waves at the bow leap into the cabin,
    The stern plows open two furrows...
    The "Floating Store" is doing good business,
    Deep friendship between the city and countryside,
    Villages along the river wave busily,
    Countless smiling faces surge to the bow of the boat.
    Uncle praises the new plow,
    Aunt pulls out colorful silk,
    Enthusiasm is sent to the heart,
    Business is done right at the doorstep.
    Purchasing and selling,
    Mountain goods are collected along with affection,
    The peddler has a drum of wind in his heart,
    Battling waves and struggling upstream.
    Traveling thousands of miles on the river for the revolution,
    Why fear fierce waves,
    The passion in my heart is like the river water,
    Flowing endlessly!

    水上商店
    〔苗族〕石太瑞沱江上，竹篙推轻舟，小船儿，两行并排游，船头浪花跳进舱，船尾犁开两道沟……“水上商店”生意好，城乡情意厚，沿河村寨忙招手，无数笑脸涌船头。大爷赞新犁，大嫂扯彩绸，热情送到心坎上，买卖作到家门口。又采购，又出售，山货收了情意收，货郎心里有面鼓风的帆，击浪搏水争上游。千里行江为革命呵，何惧恶浪陡，心中激情似江水，不尽滚滚流！
