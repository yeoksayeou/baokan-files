    Xinhua News Agency, Tenth Dispatch from New Delhi: News from New Delhi: After ten thousand tribesmen in the Mizo region of Assam, India, staged an armed uprising on February 28, they are still fighting the Indian troops sent to suppress them.
    According to reports from the Press Trust of India and Indian newspapers, approximately ten thousand armed Mizo people belonging to the Mizo National Front attacked the regional capital, Aijal, and another major county, Lunglei, as well as the region’s armory at midnight on February 28, cut off transportation lines, and engaged in fierce battles with the local "security forces."
    By March 3, Mizo armed personnel had controlled most of the region except for Aijal.
    After the incident occurred, the Indian government was very alarmed. Indian Home Minister Nanda stated in Parliament on the 2nd that he would resolutely suppress the armed uprising in the Mizo Hills, saying that the Indian government "will take strong action against Mizo extremists."
    At the same time, a large number of Indian troops were dispatched to the region. Due to the inconvenient mountainous transportation, many troops were transported there by helicopter. Lieutenant General Manekshaw, Commander of the Indian Eastern Military Region, also flew from his headquarters in Calcutta to Aijal on the 4th to command the battle. The Indian Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 5th to discuss the armed suppression of the Mizo people. Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Gandhi also rushed to Gauhati in Assam on the 7th, where she met with Assam Chief Minister Chaliha, saying that she would "pacify this disturbance."
    The Indian army's armed suppression has been strongly resisted by the Mizo tribesmen. When the Mizo people occupied Lunglei, the second largest town in the region, on the 5th, they forced some Indian troops to surrender.
    The Mizo region is located in southern Assam, is a mountainous area, covering an area of ​​approximately 8,000 square miles, with a population of approximately 260,000, belonging to two tribes – the Mizo tribe and the Lusai tribe. This region was occupied by Britain in the 19th century and later became part of India. According to Agence France-Presse, Gilbert Swell, a member of parliament representing the mountain tribes of Assam, pointed out in Parliament on the 3rd that the cause of the Mizo uprising was the neglect of the Mizo region and the forced imposition of the Assamese language on them.
    Mrs. Gandhi also admitted at a press conference in Calcutta on the 6th that most of the mountainous areas are very backward, and the Indian government "has not considered these issues."

    奋起反抗印度政府的民族压迫和军事镇压
    印度米佐部族万人武装暴动猛烈扩展
    现已控制阿萨姆米佐地区大部  印军大批赶往镇压
    新华社十日讯  新德里消息：印度阿萨姆邦米佐地区部族一万人在二月二十八日举行武装暴动后，目前仍在同前往镇压的印度军队进行战斗。
    据印度报业托辣斯和印度报纸报道，属于米佐民族解放阵线的大约一万名武装的米佐人，二月二十八日午夜袭击了这个地区的首府艾贾尔和另一个大县隆勒以及这个地区的军火库，切断了交通线，与当地的“治安部队”展开了激烈的战斗。
    到三月三日，米佐武装人员已经控制除了艾贾尔以外的绝大部分地区。
    事情发生后，印度政府十分恐慌。印度内政部长南达二日在议会上表示要坚决镇压米佐山区的武装暴动，他说，印度政府“将对米佐极端分子采取有力的行动”。
    与此同时，大批印度军队被派往这个地区，由于山区交通不便，许多部队是由直升飞机赶运到那里的。印度东部军区司令马内克肖中将也在四日从他在加尔各答的总部飞往艾贾尔指挥战斗。印度内阁五日召开紧急会议，讨论了武装镇压米佐人民的问题。印度总理甘地夫人还在七日匆匆赶到阿萨姆邦的高哈蒂，会见了阿萨姆邦首席部长恰利哈，说要“平定这种骚乱”。
    印度军队的武装镇压，遭到米佐部族人的强烈反抗。米佐人在五日占领这个地区的第二大城镇隆勒的时候，迫使了一部分印度军队投降。
    米佐地区位于阿萨姆邦南部，是一个山区，面积大约有八千多平方英里，人口约有二十六万多，属于两个部族——米佐部族和卢赛部族。这个地区在十九世纪被英国侵占，后来成为印度的一部分。据法新社报道，代表阿萨姆邦山区部族人的议员吉尔伯特·斯韦尔三日在议会上指出，造成米佐人暴动的原因是，米佐地区遭到忽视，并且强迫他们说阿萨姆语言。
    甘地夫人六日在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上也承认，大部分山区是非常落后的，而印度政府“一直没有考虑这些问题”。
