	Putting oneself in while studying Chairman Mao's writings is the key to truly learning well. Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to learn well and apply his knowledge effectively precisely because he truly put himself in the process of learning, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his own thinking and guide all his practical actions.

	Whether we can put ourselves in the picture when studying Chairman Mao’s works is a topic we often discuss. However, due to the erroneous perception that “a revolutionary worldview has already been established, and the task of ideological transformation is not significant,” this issue has not been well resolved. We often unconsciously remove ourselves and place ourselves in a position where we don’t need to be transformed. When studying Chairman Mao's writings, we often connect reality with the problems of others, neglecting to first transform ourselves. Now, I have a deeper understanding that this issue cannot be slackened in the slightest. Because:

	Only by putting ourselves in the picture can we truly combine study with application. Chairman Mao’s writings are the science that guides the proletariat in revolution and construction. Our purpose in studying them is not for "gilding," "empty talk," or any other purpose, but only, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, to strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and do a better job in revolutionary work. And to achieve this, there is the issue of transforming oneself; it is impossible to imagine that one can use Mao Zedong Thought well and do a good job while there are still many non-proletarian thoughts in one's mind.

	Only by putting ourselves in the picture can Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds. To study Chairman Mao's writings, we must grasp its spiritual essence, master the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought, and learn the thoughts and qualities of the great leader. This requires resolutely fighting against the old ideological consciousness in our minds. Without such an attitude, without putting ourselves in the picture, without contacting our own ideological reality, we will certainly be unable to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

	Only by putting ourselves in the picture can we better transform ourselves and educate others. In order to change the face of Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu first used Mao Zedong Thought to arm the leading core of the county party committee, so that the county party committee leadership could closely follow Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionization of the leading core of the county party committee has a great relationship with him as the "squad leader." It was precisely because Comrade Jiao Yulu himself was able to first study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, that he quickly promoted the revolutionization of the leading core of the county party committee.

	After initially understanding these principles, I deeply feel that the past perception that "a revolutionary worldview has already been established and does not need to be transformed any further" is extremely wrong. This viewpoint itself lacks the metaphysical viewpoint of dividing one into two and urgently needs to be transformed. In fact, as long as class struggle still exists in society, no one's ideological transformation can be "achieved once and for all," and must be continuously resolved in constant struggle.

	The content of Mao Zedong Thought is broad, profound, and extremely rich. It is a complete revolutionary ideological system and theoretical system. To study it well, we must strive to make it a lifelong task, and only by honestly putting ourselves in the picture can we truly learn it.

    把自己摆进去
    学习毛主席著作，能不能把自己摆进去，是能不能学好的关键。焦裕禄同志所以学得好，用得活，就是由于他在学习中，真正把自己摆了进去，用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，指导自己的一切实际行动。
    学习毛主席著作必须把自己摆进去，这是我们常谈的问题。可是，由于自己思想上曾经有“革命人生观已经确立了，思想改造任务不大了”的错误认识，因而这个问题并没有很好解决；常常自觉不自觉地把自己拉了出来，放在一个不必改造的地位上。在学习毛主席著作的时候，多是带着别人的问题去联系实际，忽略了首先是改造自己。现在越发深刻体会到，这个问题不能有丝毫懈怠。因为：
    只有把自己摆进去，才能真正做到学用结合。毛主席著作是指导无产阶级进行革命和建设的科学。我们学习它的目的，不是为了“镀金”、“夸夸其谈”或其他什么目的，而只能象焦裕禄同志那样，是为了严格地按照毛主席的指示办事，把革命工作做得更好。而要做到这一点，就有个改造自己的问题；不能设想，在自己头脑中还存在许多非无产阶级思想的情况下，能够用好毛泽东思想，做好工作。
    只有把自己摆进去，才能使毛泽东思想在自己头脑里扎根。学习毛主席著作要领会其精神实质，掌握毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，学到伟大领袖的思想和品质。这就要和自己头脑中旧的思想意识坚决斗争。没有这样的态度，不把自己摆进去，不接触自己的思想实际，当然就无法学到毛泽东思想。
    只有把自己摆进去，才能更好地改造自己教育别人。为了改变兰考的面貌，焦裕禄同志首先用毛泽东思想武装县委领导核心，以便使县委领导能够紧紧跟上毛泽东思想。县委领导核心的革命化，和他这个“班长”是有着很大关系的。正由于焦裕禄同志本人能够首先活学活用毛主席著作，严格按照毛主席的指示办事，才迅速促进了县委领导核心的革命化。
    初步想通这些道理之后，深深感到过去存在的那种“革命人生观已经确立，不用再改造了”的认识，是极端错误的。这种观点本身，就是缺乏一分为二的形而上学观点，就极需改造。事实上，在社会上还存在着阶级斗争的情况下，任何人的思想改造，也不可能“一劳永逸”，必须在不断斗争中不断解决。
    毛泽东思想的内容是博大精深、极其丰富的，是完整的革命思想体系、理论体系，要想学习好，是要做为毕生的任务来努力的，老老实实把自己摆进去，才能真正学到手。
