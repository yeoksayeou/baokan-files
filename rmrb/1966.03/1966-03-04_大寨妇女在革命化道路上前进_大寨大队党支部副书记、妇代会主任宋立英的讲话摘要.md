    In over ten years of work, our Women's Congress has come to understand that, to enable women to play a role in the three great revolutionary struggles, the most important thing is to give prominence to politics, use Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding principle, and take class struggle as the key link, constantly educating women to raise their class consciousness and socialist awareness.

    **Actively Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Writings**

    To do political and ideological work, first, everyone must understand what Mao Zedong Thought is. Arming the women masses with Mao Zedong Thought is fundamental.

    In August 1963, after seven days and nights of heavy rain, Dazhai suffered a massive disaster. Some women were so anxious they cried, their emotions very unstable. Our Women's Congress, following the instructions of the Party branch, organized everyone to study and discuss Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The women's emotions changed. They said: If the Foolish Old Man could move mountains, we can overcome difficulties. If the heavens wash away the old Dazhai, we will build a new Dazhai with our own hands. Thus, everyone toiled for five days, propping up over 400 mu of corn and over 100 mu of millet. Unexpectedly, a few days later, a strong wind knocked down hundreds of mu of crops again. But the women did not lose heart. They said: This is nothing. If it's knocked down, we'll prop it up again. Let's see if the heavens are more powerful or we are! After several days of hard work, the seedlings stood up straight again. At this time, the women's revolutionary will to transform the world was strengthened. They said: As long as we listen to Chairman Mao, have the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who Removed the Mountains, any difficulty, no matter how great, can be overcome, and the poorest village can be transformed.

    This made us realize that once Mao Zedong Thought arms our minds, it can unleash tremendous power. In 1964, after the Socialist Education Movement, the Party branch further organized male and female commune members to study Chairman Mao's writings. Over the past year, we have successively studied more than ten articles, including "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Combat Liberalism," and "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work."

    **Educate Women Not to Forget Class Struggle**

    In doing political and ideological work among women, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the viewpoint of class and class struggle to educate women, and never forget the bitterness of the class, and not forget class struggle.

    After the Land Reform, cooperativization, and the people's commune movement, the exploiting classes were overthrown, and some people believed that class enemies no longer existed. But in fact, the class enemies are not reconciled to their demise. Our Women's Congress, under the leadership of the Party branch, has waged many struggles against class enemies. We also joined the male commune members in using the method of comparative accounting to calculate the contrast between cooperativization and individual farming, enlightening women to recognize that only by taking the socialist road can we achieve common prosperity. We also summarized the ten superiorities of collectivization, refuting those who wanted to take the capitalist road. In class struggle, our women have been tempered.

    The Women's Congress often uses the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present to educate women about class and class struggle. We educate everyone not to forget the bitterness of the class, to be able to endure great hardship and hard work in labor and work, to overcome all difficulties, and to complete various arduous tasks. The Women's Congress also often uses the living people and events of class struggle in our village to educate the younger generation.

    In 1962, the poor peasant woman Liang Yuxiang, before her death, called her daughter Zhao Suolan to her side and repeatedly instructed her: "I suffered a lifetime in the old society. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who rescued me from the sea of ​​bitterness. You were born after liberation and have not suffered hardship, but you must not forget the bitter days of our family in the past. You must always listen to the Party and follow the Party. Work hard and don't forget that you are the daughter of a poor peasant." At that time, Zhao Suolan, who was only fourteen or fifteen years old, said with tears in her eyes: "Mom! I will definitely listen to you." After her mother's death, we often used her mother's dying words to educate her. She performed very well in all aspects, and she was a "Five-Good Commune Member" and "Five-Good Militia" every year, and she was also elected as the captain of the Iron Girls Team and the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. This January, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

    Not only must we educate the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, but we must also work on the children of landlords and rich peasants. We must educate them to draw a clear line with their parents and stand on the side of the working people.

    **Educate Women to Understand that Farming is for the Revolution**

    Our Women's Congress listens to the Party branch and takes educating women to overcome selfish and self-interested ideas and establish the idea of ​​farming for the revolution as a regular political task.

    Female commune member Zhang Guilin is now good at labor and her thinking is also good. But in the past, her thinking was relatively backward. She would be at the back when going to work and at the front when getting off work. When others were hoeing the ground, she was "running" the ground, and she wouldn't even pick up the stones she encountered. Guo Ailian, the deputy director of the Women's Congress, talked to her, and at first, she didn't admit that she had selfish and self-interested ideas. Guo Ailian enlightened her and said: "People's thinking dominates their actions. If you only think about earning work points to enrich yourself, you won't care about the quality of your work; if you think about the collective and farming for the revolution, you will treat the collective's work as your own." Slowly, Guilin began to admit that her thinking was wrong. In the past, women were unwilling to work with her, so I worked with her and often enlightened her to recall the past. Guilin was moved and paid attention to the quality of her hoeing. When the brigade inspected, they said she hoed well, and Guilin was very happy. After years of help, Guilin has changed.

    When women have the country and the collective in their hearts, they work differently. They love labor, love the collective, and have basically established the idea of ​​farming for the revolution. In 1963, we overcame the once-in-a-century disaster, and the women's thinking also achieved a great harvest, which made everyone truly understand that only by relying on the collective can we overcome all difficulties. The spirit of self-reliance has taken root in people's hearts.

    **Be Thrifty and Manage the Household for the Country and the Collective**

    Dazhai's ability to overcome difficulties with the spirit of self-reliance is closely related to the Dazhai women's thrift and management of the household over the past ten years.

    The Party branch has always attached importance to educating women to be thrifty in managing their households, and to embody the spirit of self-reliance in the daily life of commune members. The Women's Congress also takes educating women to be thrifty in managing their households as a regular task. Dazhai's grain production has increased year by year, and the living standards of commune members have improved day by day, but women have always maintained the good tradition of thrift in managing their households. Every year after the autumn accounting and distribution, they educate women to save at the top of the jar, not at the bottom of the jar. The Women's Congress also invites experienced elderly women to educate women to learn to be careful and thrifty in managing their households through their own experiences. In the past, Wang Zhongyuan's family needed relief every year, and it was never enough. The Party branch assigned the task to the Women's Congress to help Wang Zhongyuan. Later, we asked her to go to the fields to work and helped her to live thriftily. By 1959, Wang Zhongyuan's family had become a surplus grain household and had savings of 600 yuan.

    **Women's Congress Cadres Must Lead by Example**

    Over the past ten years, the cadres of the Women's Congress have listened to the Party, earnestly led by example at all times, in all matters, and strictly demanded themselves.

    First, they take the lead in participating in labor. Of our eleven committee members, apart from one who is taking care of children in the nursery group and one who cannot go to the fields to work due to special circumstances, nine committee members insist on participating in labor, picking up heavy work, hard work, and dirty work. No matter what farming skills they learn, they study hard and diligently, learning ahead of the masses. Over the past few years, the number of days worked by the cadres of the Women's Congress has exceeded the number of days worked by the same labor force. In 1965, the nine committee members worked an average of 234 days, 36 days more than the average number of days worked by the women masses. In labor, our ears are sharp and our eyes are sharp. If women have any problems, they take the initiative to discuss them with us, and we can help them solve the problems at any time. Working together with the women masses allows cadres to continuously improve under the supervision of the masses.

    Our Women's Congress cadres have strict demands on themselves. Whether in work, labor, or daily life, we do what we say. Whoever has advantages, everyone learns from. Whoever has shortcomings, we conduct criticism and self-criticism. We use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to achieve true unity.

    Our Dazhai women are determined to wholeheartedly serve the revolution, produce more grain to support the country, and support the world revolution. We must, as the Party branch teaches, stand on Tiger Head Mountain, look at Tiananmen Square, and have the whole world in our hearts. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    大寨妇女在革命化道路上前进
    大寨大队党支部副书记、妇代会主任宋立英的讲话摘要
    我们妇代会在十多年来的工作中，体会到要使妇女在三大革命斗争中发挥作用，最重要的是突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，以阶级斗争为纲，教育妇女不断提高阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟。
    活学活用毛主席著作
    做政治思想工作，首先要让大家懂得什么是毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装妇女群众，这是个根本。
    一九六三年八月，下了七天七夜的大雨，大寨遭受了特大的灾害。有些妇女急得直哭，情绪很不安定。我们妇代会按照党支部指示，组织大家学习讨论毛主席的《愚公移山》，妇女们的情绪转过来了，她们说：愚公能搬山，咱们就能克服困难，老天冲走了一个旧大寨，咱们就用自己的双手，建设一个新大寨。这样，大家苦战了五天，扶起了四百多亩玉茭，一百多亩谷子。没料到过几天，一场大风，又把几百亩庄稼刮倒了。可是妇女们没泄气，大家说：这算不了什么，刮倒了，再扶起来，看老天爷厉害，还是咱们厉害！经过几天苦战，苗儿果然又齐楚楚地站起来了。这时候，妇女们改天换地的革命意志坚定了。她们说：只要听毛主席的话，有愚公移山的精神，天大的困难也能战胜，再穷的村庄也能变样。
    这使我们认识到毛泽东思想一旦武装了我们头脑，就能发挥巨大的力量。一九六四年，经过社会主义教育运动，党支部进一步组织男女社员学习毛主席著作。一年来，我们先后学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等十多篇文章。
    教育妇女不忘阶级斗争
    在妇女中做政治思想工作，一定要遵循毛主席的教导，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点教育妇女，永远不忘阶级苦，不忘阶级斗争。
    经过土改、合作化、人民公社化，剥削阶级被打倒，有的人认为阶级敌人不存在了。但事实上，阶级敌人并不甘心死亡。我们妇代会在党支部领导下，向阶级敌人进行了好多次的斗争。我们还和男社员一道，用对比算账的办法，算了合作化和单干时的对比账，启发妇女认清只有走社会主义道路，才是共同富裕的道路。我们又总结出集体化的十大优越性，驳倒那些想走资本主义道路的人。在阶级斗争中，我们妇女受到了锻炼。
    妇代会经常用回忆对比的方法向妇女进行阶级和阶级斗争的教育。教育大家不忘阶级苦，做到在劳动和工作中，吃大苦，耐大劳，战胜一切困难，完成各项艰巨的任务。妇代会还常用本村阶级斗争的活人活事来教育年轻一代。
    一九六二年，贫农妇女梁玉祥在临死前把女儿赵素兰叫到跟前，再三嘱咐说：“我在旧社会受了一辈子苦，是共产党和毛主席把我从苦海里搭救出来的。你是解放后生下的，没有吃过苦，可不要忘记咱们家过去的苦日子。你要永远听党的话，跟着党走。好好劳动，不要忘记你是贫农的女儿。”当时，只有十四五岁的赵素兰，流着眼泪说：“妈！我一定听你的话。”她妈妈死后，我们经常用她妈妈临死时说的话教育她。她各方面表现都很好，年年是五好社员、五好民兵，还被大家选为铁姑娘队队长，共青团支部副书记。今年一月，她光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    不仅对贫农下中农的子女要进行教育，还要做地主、富农子女的工作。教育他们和自己的父母划清界限，站到劳动人民的立场上来。
    教育妇女懂得种田为革命
    我们妇代会听党支部的话，把教育妇女克服自私自利思想，树立为革命种田的思想，作为经常的政治任务。
    女社员张桂林现在劳动好，思想也好。可是过去她的思想比较落后。上工走在后头，下工走在前头。别人刨地，她是“跑”地，碰到石头也不拣起来。妇代会副主任郭爱莲和她谈心，她开头还不承认有自私自利的思想。郭爱莲启发她说：“人的思想支配行动，如果你心里只想挣工分肥自己，做活就不顾质量；你如果心里想着集体，想着种田为革命，就会把集体的活当自己的活干。”慢慢地，桂林开始承认自己的思想不对。过去妇女们都不愿和她一起干活，我就和她一起干，经常启发她回忆过去。桂林感动了，刨地注意质量。大队检查时，说她刨得好，桂林很高兴。经过多年的帮助，桂林转变了。
    妇女们心里有了国家、有了集体，干起活来就另一个样。她们热爱劳动，热爱集体，基本上树立了为革命种田的思想。一九六三年，我们战胜了百年不遇的大灾，妇女们的思想也得到了大丰收，使大家真正懂得了只有依靠集体，才能克服一切困难。自力更生精神已深入人心。
    为国家为集体勤俭持家
    大寨能以自力更生的精神，战胜困难，和大寨妇女十多年来勤俭持家有密切的关系。
    党支部一贯重视教育妇女要勤俭持家，把自力更生的精神体现在社员的日常生活中去。妇代会也把教育妇女勤俭持家作为经常工作。大寨粮食逐年增长，社员生活水平日益提高，但妇女们一直保持着勤俭持家的好传统。在每年秋天决算分配后，就教育妇女要在瓮口省，不要在瓮底省。妇代会还请有经验的老年妇女，以亲身的经历教育妇女学会精打细算，勤俭持家。过去王忠元一家，年年救济，年年不够。党支部分配给妇代会任务，要帮助王忠元。以后，我们叫她上地劳动，并且帮她勤俭过日子。到一九五九年王忠元家已经成了余粮户，还有存款六百元。
    妇代会干部要以身作则
    妇代会的干部，十多年来，听党的话，认真做到时时带头，事事带头，以身作则，严格要求自己。
    首先是带头参加劳动。我们十一个委员，除去一个在托儿组看孩子，一个因特殊情况不能上地劳动以外，九个委员坚持参加劳动，拣重活干，拣苦活干，拣脏活干，无论学习什么农活技术，都勤学苦练，学在群众的前头。几年来，妇代会干部的出勤天数，都超过同等劳力的天数，一九六五年，九个委员平均出勤二百三十四天，比妇女群众平均出勤多三十六天。在劳动中，我们的耳灵、眼灵，妇女有啥问题，都主动和我们商量，能随时帮助她们解决问题。和妇女群众在一起劳动，使干部也能在群众监督之下，不断得到进步。
    我们妇代会干部，对自己的要求是严格的。无论在工作上、劳动上、日常生活上，都是说到哪，做到哪，谁有优点，大家学习，谁有缺点，展开批评自我批评。用批评自我批评的武器，达到真正的团结。
    我们大寨妇女决心一心为革命，多打粮食支援国家，支援世界革命。我们要象党支部教育的那样：站在虎头山，眼望天安门，胸怀全世界。　（据新华社讯）
