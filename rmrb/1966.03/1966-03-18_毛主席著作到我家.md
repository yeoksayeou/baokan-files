    Mao Zedong's works come to my home, making the toothless old man grow new teeth.
    Grandpa is over sixty years old, saying he can't just sit at home.
    He says the young comrades sleep too much, helping the youth to feed the horses.
    The mules and horses are strong and fat, feeling like eating watermelon on a dog day.
    Chairman Mao's thought comes to my home, making dead trees bloom with red flowers.
    Grandma thinks of the collective in everything, no longer only caring about what's in front of her eyes.
    Now she raises pigs and accumulates fertilizer, the pigs are like calves and the manure piles are big.
    The black fertilizer goes to feed the cotton fields, urging the fat pigs to be handed over to the state.
    Chairman Mao's works come to my home, making rural construction more enthusiastic.
    Dad is the team leader in the team, working hard day and night without knowing fatigue.
    He walks ahead carrying water to fight drought, and camps in the field during the autumn harvest.
    He is wholeheartedly striving for the top, and everyone calls him a good housekeeper.
    Chairman Mao's works come to my home, spring enters the peach orchard, trees are full of flowers.
    Sister is the warehouse keeper in the team, never making a mistake with a single grain of rice or a penny.
    Whoever moves an inch of grass from the team, feels like a steel needle pricking her.
    Grandpa calls her Golden Lock, Grandma calls her Treasure Money Box.
    Chairman Mao's works come to my home, the small seedlings get rain and put down roots.
    At first, I was restless at home, but now I won't leave home even if you beat me with a stick.
    It's infinitely joyful to struggle with heaven and earth! Always remember this sentence.
    Willing to be an ox for the people, building the countryside and protecting the country.

    毛主席著作到我家
    辽宁省北票县上园公社上园大队业余创作组  宋汉荣主席著作到我家，落齿老人生新牙。爷爷年纪过花甲，说啥屋里坐不下，他说青年觉儿多，帮助青年去喂马。骡马膘肥力气壮，心象伏天吃西瓜。主席思想到我家，枯木逢春开红花。奶奶处处想集体，再不只看眼皮下。如今养猪又积肥，猪象牛犊粪堆大。黑粪去喂棉花地，赶着肥猪交国家。主席著作到我家，建设农村干劲大。爸爸队里当队长，日夜操劳不知乏。抗旱挑水头前走，秋收场里把营扎，一心一意争上游，人人叫他好管家。主席著作到我家，春进桃园树满花。姐姐队里当保管，粒米分文从不差。谁动队里一寸草，好象钢针把她扎。大爷叫她黄金锁，大娘叫她宝钱匣。主席著作到我家，小苗得雨把根扎。当初在家不安心，现在棒打不离家。与天地奋斗乐无穷！永远记住这句话。愿当黄牛为人民，建设农村保国家。
