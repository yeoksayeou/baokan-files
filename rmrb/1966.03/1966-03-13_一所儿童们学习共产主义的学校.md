    A School Where Children Learn Communism
    The Youth League Central Committee's Youth Department, the Zhejiang Provincial Youth League Committee's Student and Youth Department, and the Lin'an County Youth League Committee Working Group
    In Henglu Brigade, Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, there is a very active Young Pioneer team. It unites more than 190 children in the entire village around itself, leading them to take the revolutionary road from an early age. Guiding young children to learn to use class
          perspective to view people and things
    The painful lives of poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society are good teaching materials for class education. The Young Pioneer team invites old poor peasants with deep grievances and bitter hatreds to serve as class teachers, telling the members village history and family history. Ma Xiaogen, deputy secretary of the Party branch, often leads the children to the fields and villages, pointing to the houses and land, and telling about the cruel exploitation of peasants by landlords in the old society. Old poor peasant Ma Xingguan often tells the children about his miserable life in the old society, leading them to see the broken temple he lived in, the broken baskets and wooden buckets he used, and the worn-out cotton-padded clothes worn by three generations of his family. The Young Pioneer team also organized members to watch movies and dramas such as *The Serf*, *The Miner's Lamp*, and *Yang Libei*. These vivid facts educated the members, and they said, "Landlords are our enemies," "We must be good descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants."
    The Young Pioneer team often uses the local history of revolutionary struggle to educate young children. During the Kuomintang rule, a person in this village sacrificed heroically to cover the escape of conscripted men, leaving a blood-stained handprint on the door of a household. Young Pioneers often visit this blood-stained handprint and ask people to tell the story of the martyr's struggle. Underground Party member Lin Yanshan was arrested by the enemy, endured severe torture, and refused to yield to the enemy. The Young Pioneer team often visits the bunker where the martyr sacrificed, and holds team meetings in front of the martyr's tomb on holidays, listening to elders tell the story of Lin Yanshan's heroic struggle.
    Many members do not understand that there is still class struggle now. The Young Pioneer team invites the deputy secretary of the Party branch to give reports to the members, exposing the crimes of landlords and rich peasants in counterattacking and settling accounts and sabotaging the collective economy. After listening, the members said, "Don't think landlords look honest on the surface; they are still secretly trying to seize power from us." Member Cheng Shunbing exposed the fact that bad people were sabotaging night schools and was beaten by bad people. With the support of the Youth League branch, the Young Pioneer team conducted a reasoned struggle with this bad person. In the struggle, the children's eyes became brighter.
    The Young Pioneer team guides young children to care about world revolution. They often organize members to read newspapers, talk about the crimes of US imperialism, the victory of the Vietnamese people, and discuss Chairman Mao's several statements supporting the struggles of the people of various countries. The children know that US imperialism is the biggest enemy of the people of the world, and they say, "If US imperialism is not overthrown, there will be no peace in the world, and the suffering people will not be liberated." Educating young children to study diligently
    Under the leadership of the Youth League branch, the Young Pioneer team educates young children to study diligently. There are 194 young children in this village, and 134 attend full-time primary schools. The Young Pioneer team mobilizes graduates of higher primary schools to study in half-farming, half-study forestry middle school classes and night school junior high school classes, and establishes night school higher primary classes and lower primary classes for younger members.
    There is a saying here that goes, "A hatchet and a basket, in and out of the rice paddies, you can eat your fill even without education." Some young children are influenced by this and say, "As long as you have strength, you can earn work points and eat your fill." In response to these thoughts, the Young Pioneer team invites old poor peasants to tell the children about the suffering of being uneducated in the old society, and invites production brigade cadres to talk about the importance of education for building a new socialist countryside. The youth from this village who joined the navy also wrote to the members, telling them that to master modern weapons, they must have good ideas and education. The Young Pioneer team also held a special discussion on "Why Should We Study?" The members understood that revolution requires education, and they said, "We must master the seal, the gun, and the pen." Now, the night schools are becoming more and more solid, and they persist in studying regardless of wind or rain. The members who attend full-time schools also study hard.
    The Young Pioneer team often commends members who study well, setting examples for everyone. On rainy days, a small bridge was washed away by mountain water, and a member traveled a long way to arrive at school on time. The Young Pioneer team commended him, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm for learning. For members who have difficulty studying, the Young Pioneer team mobilizes members to help them. One member was not studying well and was held back for two consecutive years. The Young Pioneer team sent members to help him regularly, and his academic performance improved greatly, and he was promoted last year. Letting young children receive training in labor
    During the busy seasons of summer harvesting and planting and autumn harvesting and winter planting, the Young Pioneer team mobilizes older members to participate in harvesting rice and transplanting seedlings, and organizes younger members to pull seedlings, deliver meals, and take care of younger siblings. In labor, they educate the members to learn farm work. Many members have learned farm work such as plowing, transplanting seedlings, and field management. Liu Yangen, who is fifteen years old, has learned the best, and the commune members call him a "little expert." The Young Pioneers also played a role in production. The production team wanted to select fine seeds in the field, but the farm work was tight, and they could not spare labor. The Young Pioneer team took on the task and selected more than 3,000 catties of fine seeds. When the large-scale conversion from single-season rice to double-season rice was implemented, all members turned out to pull and transplant seedlings, completing the task of transplanting seedlings in the entire brigade two days ahead of schedule. The commune members said, "This year's bumper harvest is also due to the efforts of the children."
    Planting small experimental plots, conducting scientific experiments, and learning scientific farming. All seven squadrons in the brigade have a small experimental plot, and old farmers are invited to be technical instructors. The experimental plots are good places for members to learn agricultural techniques and cultivate labor perspectives and collectivism. The Party branch called for the promotion of the high-quality rice variety "Dwarf Southern Special," and the Young Pioneer team planted it in their own experimental plots. When the production team discussed the yield-increasing method of opening ditches for drainage in the green manure fields, the Young Pioneer team immediately dug deep ditches and drained stagnant water in their own green manure fields. The members also cared about the collective production of the production team. When a mountain flood broke out, it flooded the experimental plot of the fifth squadron and also flooded the production team's fields. The members first thought of not letting the production team's rice fields suffer losses and rushed to the dam to block the gap.
    The Young Pioneer team collects seeds and raises seedlings themselves, plants trees and makes forests, and is also responsible for taking care of the collective mountain forests. The members said, "To change the appearance of our hometown, we must first green the barren hills and bare ridges." They planted more than two miles of shelterbelts on the river滩 and planted more than 500 chestnut trees on the barren mountains. They opened up a small nursery of three points of land to collect seeds and raise seedlings themselves. The Young Pioneer team carefully takes care of the brigade's closed mountain forest, five mu of peach orchard, and fifteen mu of youth forest. In the past, the five mu of peach orchard could only yield a few hundred catties of peaches each year. After being handed over to the Young Pioneer team, it yielded more than 4,000 catties in one year. The commune members all said, "The Young Pioneer team really has a way."
    Establishing cattle herding teams to take good care of collective farm cattle. In the past, the cattle in this brigade were grazed separately, the cattle grew thin, and they often trampled on crops. After the establishment of the Young Pioneer team, the Young Pioneer team organized the herders and established a cattle herding team, inviting old farmers to talk about the knowledge of raising cattle and the role of cattle in production. The members all understood that cattle are the "tractors of the mountains" and the "lifeblood" of the collective, and they established a care system and took care of them very carefully. In winter, they heat warm water for the cattle to drink. In summer, they drive the cattle to deep pools for bathing. If the cattle do not want to eat grass, they cut tender grass, wrap it in soybeans, and feed them mouth by mouth. Now, the cattle are growing strong and fat. In the past two years, the cattle cared for by the Young Pioneers have bred nine calves. Carrying out diverse recreational and sports activities
    The lives of the young children in this village are very active. After study and labor, they read books, play chess, and tell stories in the children's club. They sing and play games on the roadsides in the village, and play basketball and table tennis at school. Many members also participate in the drama troupe, song and dance troupe, and waist drum team of the production brigade's club.
    The Young Pioneer team is an active propaganda force in this village. During the socialist education movement, the Young Pioneer team performed small programs such as *Don't Forget Class Bitterness* and *Old Bitterness, New Sweetness*. Around the Spring Festival, the Young Pioneer team performed *The Tale of Catching Demons* and *A Small Disturbance*, promoting the breaking of superstitions and thrift during the Spring Festival. During the busy farming season, members participated in labor while collecting good deeds and good people, compiled them into small programs, and performed them for the commune members. The commune members loved to watch these small programs. They said, "They are all based on real people and real events; the more you watch, the more you love them."
    "Little Militia" activities are also very active. The commune armed forces minister and militia company commander are their military instructors, telling them about the bad things that US imperialism has done in the world, and telling them the importance of mastering the gun. They often drill in formation, hold military games such as marching, climbing mountains, attacking hilltops, and catching special agents, and also learn military knowledge such as identifying enemy aircraft, catching airborne agents, using terrain and landforms, and shooting. Learning democratic life
    Commending and rewarding to establish good customs. Commendation and reward has been institutionalized. The roll of honor and blackboard newspaper of the Young Pioneer team often publish good deeds of members, and also focus on commending and rewarding twice a year. Since the establishment of the team, it has commended seven times, commending and rewarding 168 people, setting examples for young children in all aspects. A good atmosphere of everyone striving to do good deeds and everyone asking for progress has emerged in the entire brigade.
    For things that happen among young children, the Young Pioneer team organizes members to discuss and distinguish right from wrong. Member Cheng Shunbing did not like to work, and his parents could not control him. The Young Pioneer team held a discussion on "Is it good not to like to work?" Some members threw stones from the road randomly, and the Young Pioneer team discussed "Is it right not to care for public property?" Two members often fought, like "enemies," and the Young Pioneer team also organized discussions. In this way, the Young Pioneer team's prestige among children is getting higher and higher. Everyone actively does what the Young Pioneer team calls for; everyone can obey what they are not allowed to do. The Young Pioneer team also helps and unites children with shortcomings. All four naughty children in the brigade have made progress under the education of the Young Pioneer team. The commune members praised, "Children managing children really works." (Attached picture)

    一所儿童们学习共产主义的学校
    共青团中央少年部、共青团浙江省委学少部、共青团临安县委工作组
    在浙江省临安县横路大队，有一个非常活跃的少先队。它把全村一百九十多名少年儿童团结在自己的周围，带领他们从小走革命的道路。引导少年儿童学习用阶级的
          眼光看人看事
    旧社会贫下中农的痛苦生活，是阶级教育的好教材。少先队请苦大仇深的老贫农当阶级教员，给队员们讲村史、家史。党支部副书记马小根经常领着孩子们到田间村头，指点着房屋、土地，讲地主在旧社会对农民的残酷剥削。老贫农马兴官，经常给孩子们讲自己在旧社会的悲惨生活，领着孩子们看自己住过的破庙，用过的破篮子、木桶和三代人穿过的破棉袄。少先队还组织队员看了《农奴》、《矿灯》、《杨立贝》等电影、戏剧。这些活的事实教育了队员，他们说：“地主是我们的敌人”，“我们要做贫下中农的好后代”。
    少先队经常用本地的革命斗争历史，教育少年儿童。在国民党统治时，有一个人在本村为了掩护壮丁逃跑，壮烈牺牲，在一户人家的门上留下了血手印。少先队员经常参观这个血手印，请人讲烈士斗争的故事。地下党员林岩山被敌人逮捕，忍受严刑拷打，不向敌人屈服。少先队经常到烈士牺牲的碉堡去参观，每逢节日到烈士墓前举行队会，听长辈讲林岩山英勇斗争的事迹。
    许多队员不懂得现在还有阶级斗争，少先队请党支部副书记给队员作报告，揭露地主富农反攻倒算、破坏集体经济的罪恶。队员们听了后说：“别看地主表面老实，暗地里还在与我们夺天下。”队员程顺炳揭发了坏人破坏夜校的事实，遭到坏人毒打。少先队在团支部的支持下，同这个坏人进行了说理斗争。在斗争中，孩子们的眼睛更亮了。
    少先队引导少年儿童关心世界革命。经常组织队员读报，讲美帝国主义的罪恶，讲越南人民的胜利，讨论毛主席几次发表的支持各国人民斗争的声明。孩子们知道美帝国主义是世界人民最大的仇敌，他们说：“不打倒美帝国主义，世界上不会太平，受苦人不会得到解放。”教育少年儿童努力学习文化
    在团支部领导下，少先队教育少年儿童努力学习文化。这个村有一百九十四名少年儿童，一百三十四名上全日制小学。少先队动员高小毕业生到半农半读的林业中学班和夜校初中班学习，给年龄小的队员建立了夜校高小班和初小班。
    这里有一种“一把柴刀一只篮，进进出出在田畈，没有文化吃饱饭”的说法，有的少年儿童受了影响，说：“只要有力气，一样挣工分吃饱饭。”针对这些思想，少先队请老贫农给孩子们讲在旧社会没有文化的苦，请生产大队干部讲建设社会主义新农村要有文化的道理。当了海军的本村青年也给队员来信，告诉队员掌握现代化武器，要有好思想，也要有文化。少先队还专门举行了“为什么要读书”的讨论会，队员们懂得了干革命需要文化，他们说：“要掌握印把子，掌握枪杆子，也要掌握笔杆子。”现在，夜校越办越巩固，不管刮风下雨，都坚持学习。上全日制学校的队员，学习也很努力。
    少先队经常表扬学习好的队员，给大家树立榜样。下雨天，小桥被山水冲坏了，有个队员绕了很远的路按时来到学校。少先队表扬了他，鼓舞大家的学习积极性。对于学习有困难的队员，少先队发动队员去帮助他们。有个队员学习不好，连续两年留级，少先队派队员经常帮助他，他的学习成绩有了很大提高，去年升级了。让少年儿童在劳动中接受锻炼
    夏收夏种和秋收冬种大忙季节，少先队发动年龄大的队员参加割稻、插秧，组织年龄小的队员拔秧、送饭、带好弟妹。在劳动中，教育队员学习农活。许多队员学会了犁田、插秧和田间管理等农活，十五岁的刘炎根学得最好，社员称他是“小把式”。在生产中少先队员也发挥了作用。生产队要在田间穗选良种，但农活紧，抽不出劳力，少先队把它承担下来，选了三千多斤良种。大面积实行单季稻改双季稻，全体队员出动拔秧、插秧，使全大队插秧任务提前两天完成。社员说：“今年的大丰收，也有孩子们的一份功劳。”
    种小试验田，进行科学实验，学习科学种田。全大队的七个中队都有一块小试验田，请老农当技术指导员。试验田是队员们学习农业技术，培养劳动观点、集体主义的好地方。党支部号召推广水稻良种“矮脚南特”，少先队在自己的试验田里进行了种植。生产队商量在绿肥田开沟排水的增产办法，少先队马上在自己的绿肥田里挖深沟，排积水。队员们还关心生产队的集体生产。山洪爆发，淹了第五中队的试验田，也淹了生产队的田。队员们首先想到的是不让生产队稻田受损失，赶到水坝堵住了缺口。
    少先队自己采种育苗，植树造林，还担负了看管集体山林的任务。队员们说：“要改变家乡面貌，先要绿化荒山秃岭。”他们在河滩种植了二里多长的防护林，在荒山上栽了五百多棵栗子树。开辟了三分地的小苗圃，自己采种育苗。少先队认真看管全大队的封山林、五亩桃园和十五亩少年林。过去，五亩桃园每年只能收几百斤桃子，交给少先队以后，一年就收了四千多斤。社员们都说：“少先队的确有办法。”
    成立牧牛队，看好集体耕牛。这个大队的耕牛，过去是分散放牧，牛长得瘦，还常常糟踏庄稼。建立少先队以后，少先队把牧童组织起来，成立了牧牛队，请老农讲养牛的知识，讲耕牛在生产中的作用。队员们都懂得了耕牛是“山区的拖拉机”，是集体的“命根子”，订立了看管制度，看管得很细心。冬天，他们烧温水给牛喝。夏天，赶牛到深水潭里洗澡。牛不愿吃草，就割嫩草，包上黄豆，一口一口地喂。现在，牛长得膘肥体壮。两年来，由少先队员看管的耕牛，已繁殖了九头小牛。开展多种多样的文娱体育活动
    这个村子少年儿童的生活非常活跃，每当学习、劳动之余，他们在儿童俱乐部里看书、下棋、讲故事。在村头路边唱歌、做游戏，到学校里打篮球、乒乓球。许多队员还参加了生产大队俱乐部的剧团、歌舞队、腰鼓队。
    少先队是这个村的一支活跃的宣传力量。开展社会主义教育运动时，少先队演了《不忘阶级苦》、《旧苦新甜》等小节目。春节前后，少先队演《捉妖记》、《小风波》，宣传破除迷信勤俭过春节。农忙的时候，队员一面参加劳动，一面搜集好人好事，编成小节目，演给社员看。社员很爱看这些小节目。他们说：“演的都是真人真事，越看越爱看。”
    “小民兵”活动也很活跃。公社武装部长、民兵连长是他们的军事教员，给他们讲美帝国主义在世界上干的坏事，告诉他们要掌握枪杆子的道理。他们常常列队操练，举行行军、爬山、攻山头、捉特务等军事游戏，还学习识别敌机、捉空降特务、利用地形地物、射击等军事知识。学习过民主生活
    表扬奖励，树立好风气。表扬奖励已形成制度。少先队大队的光荣簿、黑板报，经常登载队员的好人好事，每年还集中表扬奖励两次，建队以来共表扬了七次，表扬奖励了一百六十八人次，从各方面为少年儿童树立榜样。全大队出现了人人争做好事，个个要求进步的好风气。
    少年儿童中发生的事情，少先队组织队员进行讨论，明辨是非。队员程顺炳不爱劳动，家长管不了他。少先队举行了“不爱劳动好不好？”的讨论会。有些队员拿公路上的石子乱丢，少先队讨论了“不爱护公物对不对？”有两个队员常常打架，象“仇人”一样，少先队也组织讨论。这样，少先队在儿童中威信越来越高。少先队号召的事，大家积极去做；不让干的事，大家都能服从。少先队还帮助和团结有缺点的儿童，全大队四个顽皮儿童，在少先队教育下都有进步。社员称赞说：“孩子管孩子，还真有办法。”（附图片）
