    To Paint Revolutionary Art, First Be a Revolutionary Person
    -- Enlisting in the Army and Creating Art
    Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House Wang Zhongqing Wang Guanqing Wang Yeqiu
    Last July, the three of us accepted the task of creating a series of picture books on Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi, depicting their flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's works. At the time, we were both happy and worried. We were happy because the subject matter of these three picture books was very important, and the leadership entrusted the task to us; we were worried because we lacked practical experience in military life and feared we could not complete the creative task well.
    Generally speaking, paintings with military themes are difficult to create because the People's Liberation Army's uniforms are all the same color, making it difficult for the artist to use backgrounds and props to their advantage. The whole task relies on portraying the characters' image and personality, and we were not familiar with the life of the military and the spiritual outlook of the officers and soldiers. What's more, we were painting real people and real events, with many scenes of reading, discussing, thinking, and writing心得 (personal experiences), which didn't offer much room for creative imagination. Adding to this, all three of us lacked actual training in military life, so there were indeed many difficulties.
      "To paint soldiers well, one must first be a good soldier." To help us create this series of picture books, the publishing house leadership contacted the military and arranged for us to live in a unit with a glorious history of struggle. This unit had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, achieving numerous military exploits. Currently, their achievements in studying Chairman Mao's works are also very outstanding, and they have accumulated considerable experience in emphasizing politics and flexibly applying Mao's works. Living in such a unit should be the best possible situation for our creation. Initially, we stayed at the guesthouse. Wang Yeqiu went to work in the kitchen of the military organ, and Wang Guanqing went to the guard company for interviews. The first time Wang went to the company, the soldiers offered tea and cigarettes, and there were some things to talk about; the second time, they still offered tea and cigarettes, but there was less to say; the third time, there was nothing to say. After that, he lost interest in going and simply hid in the guesthouse to paint. After working in the kitchen for a week, Wang Yeqiu felt that he was "familiar" with the background and props, so he also returned to the guesthouse and locked himself in to create.
    Of course, nothing good could come of creating while holed up in the military guesthouse. At this time, the director of the political department of the unit returned from outside and rushed to the guesthouse to see us. When he learned that we were still "building a cart behind closed doors," he hoped that we would go to the company to live and integrate with the soldiers, taking the mass line approach to creation. Soon, the leader of the creative team, Wang Zhongqing, arrived at the unit with instructions from the publishing house leadership. After a day of ideological exchange among the three of us, we finally realized that whether or not we enlisted in the army was the key to whether or not we could create well, and also a sign of whether or not we had the determination to transform ourselves. We reported this idea to the political department, which agreed that we should all enlist in the army. The three of us went to different units: Wang Guanqing to the guard company, Wang Zhongqing to the chemical defense company, and Wang Yeqiu to the kitchen of the heroic 2nd Company of the 1st Regiment. When Wang Zhongqing arrived at the company, the company commander was very enthusiastic, saying that we were highly educated and knowledgeable, and wanted us to help with the company's work, even arranging for Wang Zhongqing to sleep in the company headquarters. The company commander's words of concern sparked a fierce ideological struggle in Wang Zhongqing: should he stay in the company headquarters or go down to the squad? Going down to the squad meant being exactly the same as the soldiers, which would be hard work in the hot weather; living in the company headquarters would give him some "freedom," allowing him to choose lighter exercises to participate in or simply watch if he couldn't do it, and returning to the company headquarters to paint when he got tired. Just as he was hesitating, the director of the political department called the three of us in for a discussion. He told us not to think about anything else, but to wholeheartedly be ordinary soldiers for half a month. He said, "Being a soldier in the summer will probably be hard for you. You should be prepared to sweat more to become familiar with the life of the soldiers. Only by living in the squad, sleeping in bunk beds, eating with the soldiers squatting on the ground, learning from the most basic standing at attention and standing at ease, to live ammunition shooting at the target range, can you learn the necessary basic lessons of a soldier. Only when you have experienced the life of a soldier and have a genuine feeling for soldiers can you paint soldiers well." His words reminded us of what Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "... If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to become one with the masses, you must make up your mind and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." Where to live may seem like a "small matter," but in essence, it is an important question of how to treat self-transformation and ideological revolution. We made up our minds to first sincerely be soldiers, and then create in the company.
    The soldiers were very happy to hear that Shanghai painters were coming to be soldiers. Some gave us their lower bunks, and others rushed to hang up our mosquito nets. In particular, the squad leader was busy with everything, caring for us in every possible way, and often getting up at night to see if we were properly covered and if the mosquito nets were tucked in well. They enthusiastically taught us how to pack our bags, fold our mosquito nets, and organize our belongings, doing everything they could to help us adapt to the life of a soldier as quickly as possible.
    When Wang Zhongqing first lived with the soldiers of the chemical defense company, he found the smell of sweat and sourness on their bodies unpleasant. Later, when he put on the full protective equipment and trained with the soldiers, he was completely sealed from top to bottom, sweating all over, and unbearably hot. Recalling the scene in the documentary "China's First Atomic Bomb Explosion" where chemical defense soldiers poured buckets of sweat from their protective suits, he felt from the bottom of his heart that Huang Zushi was remarkable and the soldiers were great, and understood that without sweat, there would be no hard-won skills within 200 meters of the soldiers. His feelings changed, and he no longer cared about the smell of sweat and sourness on the soldiers and himself, and from then on, he actively participated in training.
    We studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers in the company and realized that the soldiers had a very strong concept of learning for application, learning whatever they did, and learning wherever they went. The spirit of the "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" three constantly read articles became the criteria for their actions. We deeply realized that our army is a revolutionary army that has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Living together with the soldiers without distinction, we were influenced by the soldiers' revolutionary spirit, and we felt as young as they were. We developed a sincere feeling for being a soldier in our hearts, and a desire to "love soldiers for a lifetime, learn from soldiers for a lifetime, and paint soldiers for a lifetime" sprouted from within.
    Advanced figures like Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi began to become richer and taller in our minds. Creating on this basis was far more effective than "imagining" in the office. For example, originally, when painting Feng Fusheng, eight consecutive panels depicted Feng sitting at a table in a room, calling others to talk and educate them. This time, in the company, we saw that the cadres of the squads, platoons, and companies all lived among the soldiers, and that their example was more important than their words. Only then did we realize that the original depiction did not conform to the "Feng Fusheng" in real life, so we changed it and improved the ideology of the work. Another example is Liao Chujiang, who never forgot to motivate the soldiers to study. The original scene was handled like this: during a break in the march in a heavy snowstorm, Liao gathered the soldiers on the snow to read quotation boards. Later, it was changed to each soldier hanging a quotation board on the back of his backpack, persisting in learning while marching, which not only showed Liao Chujiang's ability to combine learning with work and apply what he learned, but also showed the soldiers' spirited and hard-working spirit, and Liao Chujiang's noble qualities of caring for and showing consideration for the soldiers.
    Life in the company was extremely rich, and our twenty-plus days as soldiers was only a small part of it, so we couldn't think that everything would be fine after we finished being soldiers. We took advantage of the favorable conditions of the "three familiarities" (familiar with people, familiar with things, familiar with the environment) of being soldiers, and seized the opportunity to create in the company, learning, asking, painting, exhibiting, and revising at the same time. Each painting went through three checkpoints: the soldier checkpoint, the fine arts backbone checkpoint, and the leadership checkpoint, and the political and artistic quality was improved. The facts show that the comrades in the military have the most say. When we exhibited pencil sketches in the company, they gave more than 100 comments on the three works, large and small. In the 《廖初江》 (Liao Chujiang) manuscript, in order to express his eagerness to improve his cultural level after being promoted to platoon leader, the author drew Liao alone in a small room, looking up words in a dictionary while studying Chairman Mao's works. The soldiers sharply criticized this. They said, "Our platoon leader, except for two more pockets on his clothes, is the same as the soldiers in everything else. Our good platoon leaders all study with the soldiers. This way of painting makes people feel that Liao Chujiang is putting on the airs of a cadre as soon as he is promoted." Later, it was changed to: Liao holding a dictionary in the company club, mingling with the soldiers, and studying Chairman Mao's works together. In the 《黄祖示》(Huang Zushi) manuscript, in order to express that the soldiers were very sad when the class lost two of its four red banners while he was attending a meeting in Guangzhou, the author focused on "sadness," drawing the deputy squad leader taking down the two red flags from the wall, with all the soldiers in the class looking dejected and depressed. The soldiers and fine arts backbone, after looking at this painting, thought that "not only did Huang Zushi's leadership class lose the red flags, but they also lost their style. They don't deserve to be a four-good class just because they lost the red flags and were emotional. You can't use the method of suppressing the surrounding soldiers to elevate Huang Zushi." That's right! Only a heroic era and a heroic collective can produce countless heroic individuals. Wouldn't this painting smear the entire class? Everyone brainstormed and changed it to the deputy squad leader leading the soldiers, beating drums and gongs, and sending the two red flags to another class. Although they lost the red flags, they maintained the style of a four-good class. Some comments were general, but they were sharp and hit the nail on the head. For example, the soldiers' overall opinion of the 《丰福生》(Feng Fusheng) manuscript was that it was "too delicate and not tough enough," which pinpointed the fatal flaw in the work.
    We realized that if our worldview is not well transformed, it will definitely be expressed in our works and on the screen, and there is no room for any falsehood or disguise. Regarding whether the masses have a say in painting, or whether we painters have higher discernment, life has already provided the answer. The idea of "technique first" is constantly being challenged, and we are beginning to admit defeat.
    Our own practice, and the past and present practice of many comrades, have repeatedly proven a truth: "To paint soldiers well, one must first be a good soldier," "To paint revolutionary art, one must first be a revolutionary person." In the future, we are determined to bravely advance along the literary and art direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 要画革命画先做革命人——下连队当兵和创作

    要画革命画先做革命人
    ——下连队当兵和创作
    上海人民美术出版社  王仲清  汪观清  王野秋
    去年七月，我们三人接受了创作廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示活学活用毛主席著作连环画的任务。当时我们真是既高兴又担忧。高兴的是，这三本连环画的题材很重要，领导上把任务交给我们；担忧的是，我们都缺乏部队生活的实践，怕不能很好地完成创作任务。
    一般地说，部队题材的画是难画的，因为解放军的衣服清一色，作者难于在背景道具上取巧，全靠刻画人物的形象、性格，而我们对部队的生活和指战员的精神面貌又不熟悉。这次画的又是真人真事，其中读书、讨论、思考、写心得等等画面多，没有曲折离奇的故事，在创作上有点施展不开。更加我们三人，都缺乏部队生活的实际锻炼，困难确实不少。
      “要画好兵，首先要当好兵。”社领导上为了我们创作好这套连环画，跟部队联系好，安排我们到一个具有光荣斗争历史的部队去生活。这个部队参加过抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争，历来战功卓著。目前，学习毛主席著作成绩也十分突出，在突出政治、活学活用方面积累了不少经验。在这样的部队里生活，对我们的创作应该说是最好不过的了。开始，我们在招待所住下，王野秋到机关食堂炊事班劳动，汪观清到警卫连采访。汪第一次去连队时，战士送茶、请烟，还有些话可说；第二次去，仍然是送茶、请烟，话就少了；第三次去就没有话可说了。以后就没心思去了，干脆躲在招待所里画起来。王野秋在炊事班劳动一周后，自己认为背景道具都“熟”了，也就回到招待所，关起门来搞创作。
    蹲在部队招待所里创作，当然搞不出什么名堂来。这时候，部队政治部的主任从外边回来了，他风尘仆仆地赶来招待所看我们。当知道我们还是“闭门造车”时，就希望我们到连队去实际生活，和战士相结合，走群众路线的创作道路。不久，创作小组长王仲清带着社领导的指示赶到了部队。我们三人经过一天的思想交锋，最后认识到能否下连队当兵，是能否创作好的关键，也是有无自我改造决心的标志。我们把这个想法向政治部作了汇报，政治部同意我们都下连当兵。我们三人，汪观清在警卫连，王仲清在防化连，王野秋在英雄的一团二连炊事班。王仲清到了连队，连长非常热情，说我们文化高、见识广，要我们帮助搞好连队工作，并要王仲清睡在连部里。连长这些关心的话，引起王仲清激烈的思想斗争：蹲在连部还是下到班里？下班要完全和战士一样，大热天，是要吃苦头的；住在连部，还有一点“自由”，操练可以拣轻的参加，做不来可以旁观，看累了可以回连部去画画。正在犹豫不决之时，政治部主任找我们三人去谈话。他要我们什么也不要想，拿出半个月时间全心全意地当好普通一兵。他说：“炎夏当兵，看样子你们要辛苦了。你们要准备多流点汗，来熟悉兵的生活。只有住到班里去，睡上下铺，和战士蹲在一起吃饭，从最基本的立正稍息学起，到靶场实弹射击，才能学会一个兵的必要基础课。你们对兵的生活有了体验，对兵有了真正的感情，才能画好兵。”他的一番话，使我们记起毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说的：“……你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”住在什么地方，看来是件“小事”，但在实质上却是如何对待自我改造、思想革命化的重要问题。我们下定了决心，首先真心实意地去当兵，而后在连队里进行创作。
    战士们听说上海画家来当兵了，非常高兴。有的把下铺让给我们睡，有的抢着替我们挂蚊帐。尤其是班长忙这忙那，关怀备至，夜里还经常起来看看我们是否盖好肚子，蚊帐是否压好。他们热情地教我们打背包、叠蚊帐、整理内务，集合前帮助我们扣好衣领、戴正帽子，他们竭尽全力来帮助我们尽快适应当兵的生活。
    王仲清刚和防化连战士生活在一起时，嫌人家身上汗酸味难闻。后来他穿戴上全副防护器材与战士同操练时，从上到下密不透风，全身流汗，闷热难忍。联想起记录片《我国第一颗原子弹爆炸》中，防化学兵从防毒衣具里倒出成桶汗水的情景，从内心里感觉到黄祖示是了不起的，部队战士是伟大的，明白了没有流汗就没有战士们二百米内的硬功夫。思想感情起了变化，对战士及自己身上的汗酸味也不在乎了，从此积极参加操练。
    我们在连队和战士们一道学习毛主席著作，体会到战士们学为了用的观念非常强，做什么学什么，走到那里学到那里。《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》老三篇的精神内容，成了他们行动的准则。我们深深体会到，我们的部队，就是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的革命化的军队。
    和战士们不分彼此生活在一起，受到战士们革命气质的熏陶，自己也觉得跟他们一样年轻了。思想上对当兵有了真挚的感情，从内心里萌发出“爱一辈子兵，学一辈子兵，画一辈子兵”的愿望。
    廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示等先进人物，开始在我们头脑里丰富起来，高大起来。在此基础上创作，其效果远非蹲在办公室“设想”所能比拟的。如原先画丰福生，连续八幅都是画丰坐在房间里桌子旁边把别人找来谈话、教育，这次在连队里，看到班排连干部都是生活在战士之中，身教重于言教，才认识到原先那样描绘就不符合实际生活中的“丰福生”，因此，把它改了，提高了作品的思想性。再如廖初江时刻不忘带动战士学习，画面原来是这样处理的：大风雪中行军的间隙，廖把战士集拢在雪地上读语录牌。后来改为每个战士背包后面都挂语录牌，一边行军，一边坚持学习，既表现了廖初江善于把学习与工作结合起来，学以致用；又表现了战士意气风发，苦学苦练的精神面貌，和廖初江爱护体贴战士的高贵品质。
    连队生活极其丰富，我们当兵二十多天不过是接触了其中很少的一部分，因此不能认为一当完兵便万事大吉。我们利用当兵的“三熟”（人熟、事熟、环境熟）有利条件，趁热打铁在连队创作，边学、边问、边画、边展出、边修改。每幅画都经过三关：战士关，美术骨干关，领导关，政治和艺术质量有了提高。事实说明部队的同志是最有发言权的，我们在连队展出铅笔草稿时，他们对三部作品大大小小提了一百多条意见。《廖初江》画稿中，作者为了表现他提任排长后迫切需要提高文化水平的心情，就画廖一人关在小房间里，边查字典边学习毛主席著作。战士们对这提出了尖锐的批评。他们说：“我们的排长，除了衣服上多两只口袋外，其它什么都跟战士一样，我们的好排长都是和战士在一起学习的。这样画法使人感到廖初江一被提拔就摆干部派头。”后来改为：廖在连队俱乐部里手拿字典，和战士打成一片，共同学习毛主席著作。在《黄祖示》画稿中，作者为了表现他去广州开会期间，班里四面流动红旗丢了两面，战士们心里很难过，就在“难过”上下功夫，画成当副班长从墙上取下两面红旗时，全班战士个个垂头丧气，情绪低沉。战士和美术骨干看了这幅画，认为“黄祖示领导的这个班不仅红旗输了，而且风格也输了，单凭他们丢了红旗闹情绪这一点就不配当四好班。不能用压低周围战士的手法来拔高黄祖示。”对呀！只有英雄的时代，英雄的集体，才会产生无数的英雄个人，这样画岂不对整个班抹了灰？大家一同出主意，改成副班长领着战士，敲锣打鼓地将两面红旗送到另一班里，虽然丢了红旗，却保持了四好班的风格。有些意见虽然笼统，但却一针见血，击中要害。如《丰福生》画稿，战士们总的意见是“秀气有余，虎气不足”，这就一语道破了作品的致命伤。
    我们体会到，世界观未改造好，就一定要在作品里、画面上表现出来，来不得半点虚假和伪装。对于画是群众有发言权，还是我们这些画家鉴别力高？生活已经作出答案，“技巧第一”的思想不断受到冲击，我们开始服输了。
    我们自己的实践，许多同志过去和现在的实践，一再证明了一条真理，“要画好兵，首先要当好兵”，“要画革命画，首先要做革命人。”今后我们决心沿着毛主席指示的文艺方向奋勇前进！
