    Editor's Note: The editorial department of "New Construction" invited some in Beijing academic circles on February 2nd of this year to hold a symposium on the "upright official" problem. The speeches of the participants were published in the combined January-February issue of the journal this year. Excerpts of the speeches are now reprinted below.
    Wu Shichang: "Upright officials" implemented reforms, at least reducing the exploitation and suffering of the common people. Saying that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials" is speaking from the perspective of the subsequent dynasty.
    One opinion in the discussion was that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials" because corrupt officials made life unbearable for the people, provoking peasant resistance and accelerating the collapse of the feudal dynasty; "upright officials," on the other hand,缓和 alleviated class contradictions and delayed the collapse of the dynasty. Those who advocate this principle are speaking from the standpoint of the feudal rulers of the subsequent dynasty, because the benefits of the collapse of the old dynasty caused by peasant resistance went to the rulers of the next new dynasty, not to the peasants. Corrupt officials exploited and oppressed the people severely; "upright officials" practiced reformism and缓和 alleviated class oppression, at least reducing the exploitation and suffering of the common people. From the standpoint of the people, it is of course better to suffer less exploitation and fewer deaths.
    If it is said that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials," it would objectively lead people to think that corrupt officials should be praised and "upright officials" should be overthrown. Following this logic, Qin Hui would be better than Yue Fei. When the Jin troops invaded, the main contradiction of the Song Dynasty was foreign invasion. Qin Hui advocated缓和 alleviating this contradiction. He became a traitor and colluded with the enemy. The people opposed him, which aggravated the contradiction between the people and the Song Dynasty. Yue Fei resisted the Jin invaders, defended against foreign aggression, and the people supported him. Some may say that the people would think the Song Dynasty government was not bad because there was a Yue Fei in the Song Dynasty government who was supported by the people. Wouldn't Yue Fei then have缓和 alleviated class contradictions and delayed the collapse of the Song Dynasty? Qin Hui acted in the opposite way to Yue Fei, aggravating class contradictions and accelerating the collapse of the Song Dynasty, so it seems that Qin Hui was better than Yue Fei. This is the conclusion that would be drawn from the principle that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials."
    Tang Lan: "Upright officials" do not necessarily appear when feudal dynasties are declining. Whether "upright officials" are beneficial to the people should be analyzed specifically according to the person and the event. "Upright officials" are not models for us to learn from.
    The concept of "upright official" is not very old. Legends about Bao Zheng only slowly spread after the Yuan Dynasty. At that time, there didn't seem to be the term "upright official." After Hai Rui of the Ming Dynasty died, he was only called "loyal and upright," not "upright official." It was probably Emperor Kangxi who most vigorously promoted "upright officials." Peng Peng, Shi Shilun, and others were all called "upright officials."
    Promoting "upright officials" met the needs of the ruling class. Some articles now say that "upright officials" appear when feudal dynasties are declining. I don't think that's always the case. The Kangxi period was a "prosperous age," but corruption may have been very serious at that time. Many corrupt officials were not conducive to maintaining feudal rule, so Emperor Kangxi especially promoted "upright officials." "Upright officials" were valued because they were "utterly loyal" to the feudal rulers. Peng Peng, Yu Chenglong, and Shi Shilun in the Kangxi period all served the ruling class, suppressed peasant uprisings, and consolidated the feudal dynasty.
    Are "upright officials" beneficial to the people? This question cannot be answered in general terms. Each "upright official" has his specific circumstances. A certain thing done by an "upright official" may have some small benefits for the people. For example, Hai Rui advocated repairing the Wusong River. On the one hand, he used the project to gather famine victims and缓和 alleviate class contradictions, fearing that the people would revolt, which was to consolidate the interests of the ruling class; on the other hand, it was objectively beneficial to the people. But as far as he as a whole person is concerned, he was only a tool beneficial to feudal rule and was not beneficial to the people.
    As for whether the common people said "upright officials" were good, in that time, in a certain place, who would dare not obey what the gentry said? After Hai Rui died, who would dare not go to his funeral when the gentry told people to go? After Shi Shilun left office, someone proposed that everyone take out one wen of money to build a pavilion for him as a memorial, which was called "One Wen Pavilion." When the landlord class made such an appeal, no common person dared not to comply. Of course, there were also some common people who were deceived and said "upright officials" were good. But we cannot conclude from this today that the common people at that time said he was good. At that time, the common people always called the county magistrate "blue sky grand master," but most of the officials they encountered were corrupt and venal. Some "upright officials" like Hai Rui may have been slightly better in character than other feudal bureaucrats and did not commit any major sins. But some "upright officials" like Yu Chenglong were the most ruthless in suppressing peasant uprisings and were executioners with blood on their hands, so their crimes were heinous. In any case, we should negate the entire "upright official" and cannot regard them as models for us to learn from.
    Some people want to say that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials," which is not objective. In comparison, "upright officials" are always a little better than corrupt officials. Hai Rui is better than Yan Song. Just from the point of view of incorruptibility, the difference between "upright officials" and corrupt officials may only be fifty steps versus a hundred steps, but there is still a difference! Treating them all the same, with no distinction, is not convincing.
    Yang Yizhi: "Upright officials" are the pedantic defenders of the feudal society. We cannot say that they are so good, but we cannot say that "upright officials" are worse than corrupt officials.
    "Upright officials" are a false image created by the feudal rulers for their own benefit. It is something that can deceive people very well.
    Feudal dynasties always tend to merge and annex, illegally occupying a lot, weakening the interests of the central government of the feudal dynasty. Most of the people's wealth was embezzled by corrupt officials. In the Ming Dynasty, not only were the officials corrupt, but the lower-level clerks in various departments were also very corrupt. The entire feudal regime was built on embezzlement. The feudal rulers vigorously promoted "upright officials," which was inseparable from this phenomenon of embezzlement and was based on the contradictions in the interests of the feudal ruling class.
    The behavior of "upright officials" and their influence in society generally appear in the form of pedantry and rigidity, often manifested as the pillars of feudal customs and ethics. Comrade Wu Han said that Hai Rui was a leftist in politics at that time, which is hard to say. In short, on the one hand, "upright officials" are related to the financial situation of feudal society and the phenomenon of embezzlement. Under the phenomenon of embezzlement, they are needed by the feudal rulers. On the other hand, "upright officials" are the pedantic defenders of the feudal society, and we cannot say that they are so good.
    We say that "upright officials" are not so good, but we cannot conversely say that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials." This starts from a concept, not from the method of class analysis.
    The difference between "upright officials" and corrupt officials is that "upright officials" serve the ruling class more consciously than corrupt officials, while corrupt officials are not very conscious. But we cannot therefore say that "upright officials" are worse than corrupt officials. For the people, we cannot say that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials," and we cannot say that corrupt officials are more useful to the people because the people oppose corrupt officials, saying that corrupt officials aggravate class contradictions.
    The "upright official" problem is also related to the problem of morality. I more agree with the view that feudal morality cannot be inherited by the proletariat. The morality of "upright officials" is part of the state machinery for consolidating feudal rule. We can only smash it, not inherit it.
    Zheng Tianting: "Upright officials" and corrupt officials are both executors of feudal oppression. Under certain conditions, the peasant class and the landlord class may have relatively common interests. "Upright officials" are the product of the intensification of class contradictions in feudal society, and the ruling class can use them in many ways.
    Corrupt officials are officials, and "upright officials" are also officials. The difference between "upright officials" and corrupt officials in dealing with the peasant class is only the difference between heavier and even heavier exploitation, and between harsher and even harsher oppression. There is no difference between exploitation and non-exploitation, oppression and non-oppression.
    Why are "upright officials" more liked than corrupt officials? This may be because officials and the people are contradictory aspects coexisting in the unified entity of the feudal state. They have the same thing, so under certain conditions, they may have some common interests. For example, "upright officials" build water conservancy projects, which increases production, which is beneficial to the peasants and also beneficial to the ruling class. Corrupt officials may hope for disasters so that they can embezzle and profit from them. Because the peasants and the landlord class may have relatively common interests under certain conditions, peasants may also relatively like "upright officials" at times. But we cannot exaggerate this conditional and relative thing, regard it as absolute, and forget the opposing struggle.
    The emergence of "upright officials" is a reflection of the intensification of class struggle. Some people say that "upright officials" appear when class contradictions are intensifying and the ruling class is declining. This is not the case. Ji An appeared during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, not during the reign of Emperor Ai or Emperor Ping. Bao Zheng appeared during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, not during the reign of Emperor Huizong or Emperor Qinzong. Many "upright officials" in the Qing Dynasty appeared during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, not after the reigns of Emperor Jiaqing or Emperor Daoguang. The feudal ruling class vigorously promoted "upright officials," obviously to缓和 alleviate the initial sharp contradictions. As for after the contradictions intensified and peasant wars broke out, no matter how "upright officials" were promoted, it was of no avail, so the feudal rulers stopped talking about "upright officials."
    "Upright officials" are not identified by the peasants. The "departure remembrance steles," "flattering tomb inscriptions," and "upright officials" and "blue sky" that appear in public and private biographies are masterpieces of feudal scholar-officials. This "upright official" title was not only fabricated by feudal scholar-officials but also by feudal emperors. Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty said that Yu Chenglong was the "number one upright official of today" and that Zhang Boxing was the "number one upright official in the world."
    The so-called "incorruptibility" of the "upright officials" recorded in history is unbelievable. Some are self-promotion, some are mutual praise, some are promoting their own families, and some are beautifying the feudal society at that time.
    The role played by "upright officials" is viewed in absolutely opposite ways by the peasant class and the landlord class. "Upright officials" have many places worth using for the feudal ruling class: First, "upright officials" will not use state property for personal gain, which can guarantee the income of the court. Second, "upright officials" generally try to permanently preserve the old feudal order. Their political ideology is to repair and patch up the feudal system, not to make major changes, nor to make all-round reformism. Third, "upright officials" are the defenders of the "four major ropes" of feudal rule. Fourth, "upright officials" have a side of absolute loyalty to the feudal ruling class and a side of relative deception to the peasant class, so the feudal rulers often use them to deceive the peasants.
    "Upright officials" are more deceptive than corrupt officials, often making people overlook their essence. So we say that "upright officials" are more dangerous, and we should be more vigilant about "upright officials," but we cannot say that "upright officials" are worse than corrupt officials.
    Does negating "upright officials" mean smearing the bright side of history? No. The Chinese nation has its great and bright history, and the bright history should first be the history of the working people who promote historical progress. In the past, historical narratives about the people were too few, and we should further investigate and excavate them. If we do not look for the real bright side of the people and use some things of the landlord class to beautify and pretend to be the people, this is truly smearing history.
    He Lin: Old intellectuals fear class struggle and always want to engage in class reconciliation. Saying that "upright officials" scold the emperor distorts the class essence of "upright officials" and blurs class boundaries.
    Old intellectuals have two major problems in transforming their worldviews: One is that they are afraid of class struggle and do not want to participate in class struggle. They are afraid of fighting others and also afraid of fighting themselves. They always want to find something to engage in "class reconciliation theory" as a spiritual support to comfort themselves and stand aloof from class struggle.
    "Upright officials" are the emperor's loyal servants and would never scold the emperor. Loyal admonition and scolding are two different things. Wei Zheng sometimes argued very fiercely and impolitely with Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, but this is not called scolding. The great executioner Zeng Guofan also submitted a memorial "Respectfully Presenting Three Aspects of Sagely Virtue" to Emperor Xianfeng, offering his opinions. Emperor Xianfeng was very angry after reading it and threw his memorial on the ground, wanting to punish him. After his teachers and friends pleaded for him, he still received a "generous edict of praise." Sometimes, feudal bureaucrats were dissatisfied with the emperor. But direct admonition does not have the meaning of personal complaint and resistance. "Upright officials" scolding the emperor is nothing more than being loyal and using direct admonition to desperately want the emperor to improve. There are contradictions and struggles between "upright officials" and corrupt officials, and between loyal ministers and treacherous ministers, but both sides support the emperor. Loyal ministers are wholeheartedly loyal to the emperor and have no regrets even in death. Saying that they "scold the emperor" contradicts the image and essence of "upright officials" as loyal ministers. Comrade Wu Han said that "upright officials" scold the emperor, seemingly thinking that Hai Rui was speaking from the standpoint of the people rather than from the standpoint of the ruling class. He clearly did not understand the class essence of "upright officials" and blurred class boundaries.
    Feng Youlan: "Upright officials" are relatively less corrupt and can be more impartial in judging lawsuits. The actions of "upright officials" cannot be said to be reformist but are to defend the foundation of the feudal system. Praising "upright officials" aims to beautify the feudal system.
    Mr. Zheng Tianting said at the beginning that both landlords and peasants say that "upright officials" are good, possibly because the interests of landlords and peasants also have something in common. This explanation is very inappropriate. Later, Mr. Zheng cited a large amount of historical material to prove that "upright officials" were identified by the emperor and praised by the landlord class. This cancels out the original question.
    Saying that "upright officials" are "as clear as water and as bright as a mirror" means that they are relatively less corrupt and can be more impartial in judging lawsuits. In feudal society, corrupt officials, venal officials, and muddle-headed officials were everywhere, and unjust cases were everywhere. If an individual official could overturn a few unjust cases, it could make people feel happy at the time. Overturning individual unjust cases benefits individuals but does not greatly benefit the peasant class.
    These actions of "upright officials" cannot be said to be reformist, let alone "impacting the foundation of the feudal system" as Comrade Wu Han said. On the contrary, the actions of "upright officials" are to defend the foundation of the feudal system. Whether "upright officials" are truly "incorruptible" or falsely "incorruptible," they are always "officials." The feudal system is the basis of their existence. We should evaluate "upright officials" according to specific circumstances and should not promote "upright officials." Vigorously praising "upright officials" aims to beautify feudal laws, feudal morality, and the feudal system. This is a means for the feudal ruling class to 麻醉 paralyze the people.
    Weng Dujian: From a historical perspective, there were some "upright officials" who were better than corrupt officials. The ruling class advocated "upright officials," and the people also had the concept of "upright officials."
    "Upright officials" are essentially tools of the feudal ruling class. There is no disagreement on this point now. There are still some questions:
    First, were there really "upright officials" in history? From the point of view that "upright officials" belong to the exploiting class, they are all exploiting, so what is "incorruptible" or "not incorruptible"? In this way, it can also be said that there are no "upright officials." However, from a historical perspective, from the division within the exploiting class, relatively speaking, there are still "upright officials." They exploited within the "legal" scope and, compared with corrupt officials, were more far-sighted members of the ruling class. We must look at problems from a historical perspective. From their own class perspective, there were some "upright officials" who were better than corrupt officials. Of course, there were not many "upright officials" in history, and there was a distinction between genuine and fake. Especially the "upright officials" depicted in dramas and novels are even less historical truth.
    The ruling class advocated "upright officials," which is not a problem. From a historical perspective, did the people have the concept of "upright officials"? I think they did. This is not surprising.
    Second, which is better, "upright officials" or corrupt officials? From the specific circumstances of a certain historical period, relatively speaking, there is a distinction between "upright officials" and corrupt officials. "Upright officials" are always a little better than corrupt officials. Individual unjust cases were overturned, which brought some benefits to the people. The fact that "upright officials" are better than corrupt officials is naturally limited, and they are not the ones who influenced historical development. Even when studying the history of the ruling class, "upright officials" do not rank. From a certain historical perspective, we can say that "upright officials" are better than corrupt officials, but abstracting them and asking people today to learn from them, I think, is not right.
    Du Renzhi: Restricting corruption and embezzlement is the social root cause of the emergence of "upright officials"; Confucianism is the ideological root cause of "upright officials." "Upright officials" and corrupt officials should both be viewed with a two-sided approach.
    There were "upright officials" in history, and they are relative to corrupt officials. The "upright officials" recorded in history were shaped by the ruling class praising them and scholar-officials exaggerating them. China was a long-term centralized feudal society with a complete ruling organization and many levels. In exploiting the labor results of the peasants, it was easy for corruption and embezzlement to occur. The feudal rulers then advocated "upright officials" to restrict corruption and embezzlement. This is the social root cause of the emergence of "upright officials." Secondly, Confucianism is the ruling ideology of China's long-term feudal society. The basic content of Confucianism is "benevolence," "benevolent governance" that conciliates class contradictions, and the "doctrine of the mean" of eclecticism. The ideological root cause of "upright officials" comes from here.
    The proletariat must rewrite history and therefore must re-evaluate historical figures. Generally speaking, "upright officials" and corrupt officials, as well as the roles they played, should be viewed with a two-sided approach. "Upright officials" and corrupt officials are different. This is a two-sided view of feudal officials. The role of "upright officials" should also be viewed with a two-sided approach. On the one hand, "upright officials" consolidate feudal rule and play a role in maintaining the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class; on the other hand, in certain matters and in certain periods, they did good things that benefited some of the people. This beneficial aspect to the people can also be viewed with a two-sided approach. On the one hand, it is beneficial to the people; on the other hand, it has a deceptive and 麻醉 paralyzing effect on the people, bringing illusions to the people at that time, especially after being rendered in operas and novels, which has a more paralyzing effect on the people.
    Corrupt officials should also be viewed with a two-sided approach. On the one hand, corrupt officials exploit more and oppress more fiercely, which is harmful to the people at the time; on the other hand, it arouses the people's hatred for feudal rule and promotes the people's resistance to feudal rule. This is turning a bad thing into a good thing. This is the development of the contradictory dialectic of affirmation and negation on this issue.
    Zhu Guangqian: The feudal ruling class promoted "upright officials" in order to 麻醉 paralyze the people. What is the point of distinguishing between "upright officials" and corrupt officials today?
    Are there really "upright officials"? Everyone was talking about it from a historical perspective just now. How credible is this confused account of past history? You don't have to talk about ancient times. You can think about things we have experienced ourselves. I am almost seventy years old and have experienced the late Qing Dynasty, Yuan Shikai, the Northern Warlords, and the rule of Chiang Kai-shek. When I thought about the officials I knew, which one was an "upright official"? I can't find one! Is it necessary to distinguish between "upright officials" and corrupt officials? Everyone said that "upright officials" were "钦定 appointed by the emperor," and the feudal rulers promoted "upright officials" for their ruling interests in order to 麻醉 paralyze the people. It was beneficial for the feudal rulers to separate "upright officials" from corrupt officials. Today, we are studying history from a Marxist point of view. What is the point of distinguishing between "upright officials" and corrupt officials? How much good does this do for us in explaining history?
    Marx said that capitalists should exploit workers as much as possible but also provide workers with the minimum living materials in order to continue to exploit them. I think that all exploiting classes in the past treated the working people in this way. There was a contradiction of both exploiting them as much as possible and maintaining the minimum living conditions to continue to exploit them. Corrupt officials exploit to the end, regardless of the life or death of the people; "upright officials" exploit to a certain extent so that the peasants can survive and continue to be exploited.
    Jian Bozan: The "upright official" problem cannot be taken lightly. "Upright officials" cannot be found in history. It is very difficult to draw a line between "upright officials" and corrupt officials. It is suggested that several "upright officials" be dissected to clarify the truth.
    The "upright official" problem is not small and cannot be taken lightly. Although "upright officials" do not occupy a large position in history, the understanding of "upright officials" is crucial to the principles of evaluating historical figures. Moreover, the "upright official" problem is not only a problem of history but also a problem of literature and drama.
    There is no divergent opinion on the essence of "upright officials." There is now such a problem, namely, who is better, "upright officials" or corrupt officials? To solve this problem, we must first study the question raised by a comrade just now: Are there really "upright officials" in history? Some "upright officials" have been written about in history, and the question is whether these "upright officials" written about in history count as "upright officials."
    Sima Qian wrote about an "upright official," Gongyi Xiu, in "Records of the Historian: Biographies of Circumspect Officials." Gongyi Xiu was a scholar from the State of Lu who became the prime minister of Lu because of his high marks. He loved to eat fish, and someone who knew his preference gave him fish. He did not accept it, saying: "Now that I am the prime minister, I can provide myself with fish. If I accept the fish now and am dismissed, who will give me fish again? That is why I do not accept it." This story clearly shows that Gongyi Xiu was not not greedy but was afraid of losing his position of great greed because of small greed.
    True "upright officials" cannot be found in history. Therefore, it is very difficult to draw a line between "upright officials" and corrupt officials. If you must draw a line, it is not a question of "incorruptibility" and greed but a question of the amount of greed.
    Some articles propose that "upright officials" abide by the law, while corrupt officials pervert the law. It seems that a line can be drawn from here. "Records of the Historian: Biographies of Cruel Officials" records that Du Zhou judged cases only according to the emperor's intentions, not according to the law. Someone blamed him, and he said: "Where is the three-foot law? What the former ruler said was right was established as law, and what the later ruler said was right was established as an order. What is right at the time, what is the ancient law?" These words reveal the essence of law in the feudal era and also illustrate that the distinction between abiding by the law and perverting the law is only that one follows what the former ruler said was right, and the other follows what the later ruler said was right. The former ruler and the later ruler are both feudal emperors, so in essence, they are both implementing the laws and decrees of the feudal ruling class to exploit the people, oppress the people, and consolidate the class rule of the feudal landlord class.
    In order to further develop the discussion on the "upright official" problem, I suggest dissecting several "upright officials" promoted by feudal historians to see if they are true "upright officials," what "incorruptibility" they have, and to what extent they are "incorruptible." Also dissect several corrupt officials to see how great the gap is between them and the "upright officials." At the same time, those detective novels that promote "upright officials" should also be turned out for review, pointing out how and for what purpose feudal writers manufactured these "upright officials."

### 北京学术界部分人士座谈“清官”问题

    北京学术界部分人士座谈“清官”问题
    编者按  《新建设》编辑部于今年二月二日邀请北京部分学术界人士，就“清官”问题举行了座谈会。并于该刊今年一、二月号合刊，发表了与会者的发言。现将发言摘要转载如下。
    吴世昌：“清官”实行改良，至少使老百姓少受剥削、少受罪。说贪官比“清官”还好，是站在后一个王朝上说话的。
    讨论中有一种意见，认为贪官比“清官”还好，因为贪官使民不堪命，激起了农民的反抗，加速了封建王朝的崩溃；“清官”则缓和了阶级矛盾，延缓了王朝的崩溃。主张这个原则的人，是站在后一个王朝封建统治者的立场上说话的，因为农民反抗所引起的旧王朝的崩溃，好处是被下一个新王朝的统治者得去了，农民是得不到的。贪官对人民的剥削和压迫很厉害；“清官”实行改良主义，缓和阶级压迫，至少使老百姓少受剥削、少受罪。站在人民的立场上看，当然是少受剥削、少死人好。
    如果说贪官比“清官”好，客观上就会使人认为应当赞成贪官，打倒“清官”。按照这样的逻辑推下去，秦桧就会比岳飞好。金兵入侵时，宋朝的主要矛盾是外族侵略。秦桧主张缓和这个矛盾，他当汉奸，与敌人勾结，人民反对他，这就加剧了人民与宋王朝的矛盾。岳飞抗金人，御外侮，人民赞成他，有人可能会说，人民就会因为宋朝政府里还有这么一个受人民拥护的岳飞，而认为宋朝政府还不错；这样，岳飞不是缓和了阶级矛盾，延缓了宋王朝的崩溃吗？秦桧反岳飞之道而行，加剧了阶级矛盾，加速宋王朝的崩溃，似乎秦桧倒比岳飞好了。这就是贪官比“清官”好的原则所将得出的结论。
    唐  兰：“清官”不一定出在封建王朝走下坡路的时候。“清官”对人民有无好处，要根据其人其事作具体分析。“清官”不是我们学习的典范。
    “清官”这个概念，不是很早就有的。关于包拯的传说，是从元朝以后才慢慢流传的，那时似乎还没有“清官”这个名词。明朝的海瑞死后，也只叫他做“忠介”，没有叫他“清官”。大概康熙时提倡“清官”最力，彭鹏、施世纶等都叫“清官”。
    提倡“清官”，是适应统治阶级的需要的。现在有些文章说，“清官”出在封建王朝走下坡路的时候，我看并不都是这样，康熙时就是“盛世”，不过，那时的贪污可能很厉害。贪官多，不利于维护封建统治，所以康熙时特别提倡“清官”。“清官”受到重用，就是由于他们对封建统治者“赤胆忠心”，康熙时的彭鹏、于成龙、施世纶，都是效忠统治阶级，镇压农民起义，巩固封建王朝的。
    “清官”对人民有没有好处呢？这个问题不能笼统地回答。每个“清官”有其具体的情况。一个“清官”所作的某件事，对人民可能有一些些好处。例如海瑞倡议修吴淞江，一方面是以工程招集饥民，缓和阶级矛盾，怕人民造反，是为了巩固统治阶级的利益；另一方面，客观上对人民是有利的。但就他整个的人来说，不过是有利于封建统治的工具，对人民是不利的。
    至于老百姓是否说“清官”好呢？在那个时候，在一个地方上，乡绅说了话，谁敢不依？海瑞死了后，乡绅叫人们去送丧，谁敢不去？施世纶离任后，有人倡议每人拿出一文钱，给他盖个亭子做纪念，就叫做“一文亭”。地主阶级如此一号召，老百姓谁也不敢不依。当然，也还有些老百姓是受了欺骗而说“清官”好的。但是，我们今天却不能由此就认为当时的老百姓说他好。那时，老百姓见了县官总叫“青天大老爷”，但碰到的大都是贪官、赃官。有些“清官”象海瑞之类，在封建官僚中可能品行略好一些，也没有什么太大罪恶。但有些“清官”象于成龙之类，镇压农民起义最凶，是手上沾满血的刽子手，那就罪大恶极了。无论如何，对于整个“清官”，我们应该予以否定，不能把他们作为我们学习的典范。
    有些人要说贪官比“清官”更好，那是不客观的。对比起来，“清官”总比贪官好一点儿，海瑞比严嵩总好些。只从清廉的一点来讲，“清官”与贪官尽管只是五十步与百步之差，总还是差一点吧！一锅煮了，没有区别，也就没有说服力了。
    杨一之：“清官”是封建社会的迂腐的卫道者。不能说他们有多么好，但不能说“清官”比贪官更坏。
    “清官”是封建统治者为了自己的利益制造出来的假象。它是很能迷惑人的东西。
    封建王朝总是兼并成风的，非法侵占很多，削弱了封建王朝中央的利益，民脂民膏大半被贪官中饱了。明朝不只是官贪，就是各部的吏也贪污得很厉害，整个封建政权就是建立在中饱之上的。封建统治者极力提倡“清官”，是同这种贪污中饱的现象分不开的，是建筑在封建统治阶级这种利害关系的矛盾上的。
    “清官”的行为以及他们在社会上发生的影响，一般是以迂腐与呆板的形式出现的，常常表现为封建的风俗习惯和伦常的支柱。吴晗同志说海瑞是当时政治上的左派，这很难说。总之，“清官”一方面与封建社会的财政状况和贪污中饱现象相联系，在贪污中饱现象之下，为封建统治者所需要；另一方面，“清官”是封建社会的迂腐的卫道者，不能说他们有多么好。
    我们说“清官”不那么好，但不能反过来说，贪官比“清官”好。这是从概念出发，不是从阶级分析方法入手。
    “清官”与贪官不同的地方，在于“清官”为统治阶级服务比贪官更自觉一些，贪官则不很自觉。但不能因此说“清官”比贪官更坏。对于人民来说，不能说贪官比“清官”更好一些，不能因为人民反对贪官，说贪官加剧了阶级矛盾，因此贪官对人民就更有用一些。
    “清官”问题与道德问题也有联系。我比较同意封建道德不能为无产阶级所继承的主张。“清官”的道德是巩固封建统治的国家机器的一部分，我们只能打碎它，不能继承它。
    郑天挺：“清官”和贪官都是封建压迫的执行者。农民阶级与地主阶级在一定条件下，可能有相对的共同利益。“清官”是封建社会阶级矛盾走向尖锐化的产物，统治阶级有许多地方可以利用他们。
    贪官是官，“清官”也是官。“清官”与贪官对待农民阶级，在剥削上只有重与更重的差别，在压迫上只有狠与更狠的差别，没有剥削与不剥削、压迫与不压迫的差别。
    “清官”为什么比贪官受人喜欢？这可能是由于官与民是共处于封建国家这个统一体中的矛盾着的两个方面，他们有着同一性，因此，在某种条件下可能有某些共同利益。例如“清官”兴修水利，生产提高了，对农民有利，对统治阶级也有利。贪官则可能希望发生灾荒，以便从中贪污渔利。正因为农民和地主阶级在一定条件下相对地可能有共同利益，所以农民也有时相对地可能喜欢“清官”。但是我们不能夸大这种有条件的、相对的东西，把它认为是绝对的，而忘了对立的斗争。
    “清官”的出现是阶级斗争走向尖锐化的反映。有人说，“清官”是在阶级矛盾处于尖锐化、统治阶级走下坡路的时候出现的。事实并不是这样。汲黯出现在汉武帝时，而不在哀帝、平帝时。包拯出现在宋仁宗时，而不在徽宗、钦宗时。海瑞出现在嘉靖时，而不在万历、天启以后。清代很多“清官”出现在康熙时，而不在嘉庆、道光以后。封建统治阶级大力宣扬“清官”，显然是用来缓和初期的尖锐矛盾。至于矛盾激化以后，农民战争爆发了，无论怎样宣扬“清官”也无济于事了，所以封建统治者也就不谈“清官”了。
    “清官”不是农民鉴定的。在许多“去思碑”、“谀墓文”以及公私传记中出现的“清官”、“青天”之类，是封建士大夫们的杰作。这种“清官”称号不但由封建士大夫来捏造，而且由封建皇帝来捏造。清代康熙皇帝既说于成龙是“今时清官第一”，又说张伯行是“天下清官第一”。
    记载上所谓“清官”之“清”是不可信的。有的是自我宣传，有的是互相标榜，有的是宣扬自己的家族，有的是美化当时的封建社会。
    “清官”所起的作用，农民阶级的看法和地主阶级看法，是绝对相反的。“清官”对于封建统治阶级有许多值得利用的地方：一，“清官”不会利用国家财物营私舞弊，可以保证朝廷的收入。二，“清官”一般都企图永久保存封建旧秩序，他们的政治思想是对封建制度的修修补补，而不是大改动，也不是全盘改良的改良主义。三，“清官”是封建统治的“四大绳索”的卫道人。四，“清官”有对封建统治阶级绝对忠顺的一面，又有对农民阶级相对迷惑的一面，所以封建统治者常常用来欺骗农民。
    “清官”比贪官迷惑人，常常使人忽略他们的本质。所以我们说“清官”更危险，对“清官”更要提高警惕，但不能说“清官”比贪官更坏。
    否定“清官”，是不是就抹黑了历史的光明面？不。中华民族有它的伟大的、光明的历史，首先应该是推动历史前进的劳动人民的光明历史。过去历史对于人民的论述太少了，我们应该进一步的去调查、去发掘。如果不去找真正的人民的光明面，而用一些地主阶级的东西加以美化，冒充人民的，这才是真正给历史抹黑。
    贺  麟：旧知识分子怕阶级斗争，总想搞阶级调和。说“清官”骂皇帝，是歪曲了“清官”的阶级本质，模糊了阶级界限。
    旧知识分子在改造世界观方面存在两个大问题：一是害怕阶级斗争，不想参加阶级斗争。怕斗争人家，也怕斗争自己，总想找一个什么东西来搞“阶级调和论”，以此作为精神依托，安慰自己，超然于阶级斗争之外。
    “清官”是皇帝的忠实奴仆，根本不会骂皇帝。忠谏与骂是两回事。魏征同唐太宗争论有时很激烈，很不客气，但这不叫骂。大刽子手曾国藩也上过疏《敬陈圣德三端》，向咸丰皇帝提意见，咸丰看了很生气，把他的奏折摔在地上，要办他的罪。经他的老师和朋友求情后，还得到“优诏褒答”。有时封建官僚对皇帝不满的情况是有的。而直谏则没有私人抱怨和反抗的意思。“清官”骂皇帝，无非是忠心耿耿，用直谏的方式拼死命要皇帝改好。“清官”和贪官之间，忠臣和奸臣之间有矛盾、有斗争，但他们双方都拥护皇帝。忠臣死心踏地的忠于皇帝，死而无怨。说他们“骂皇帝”，这同“清官”作为忠臣的形象和本质有矛盾。吴晗同志说“清官”骂皇帝，似乎以为海瑞是站在人民的立场而不是站在统治阶级的立场说话。他显然是没有搞清楚“清官”的阶级本质，模糊了阶级界限。
    冯友兰：“清官”比较不贪赃枉法，断官司比较能持平。“清官”的行动说不上改良主义，而是卫护封建制度的基础的。吹捧“清官”，目的是美化封建制度。
    郑天挺先生开头说，地主和农民大家都说“清官”好，可能是由于地主和农民的利益也有一致之处。这个解释很不妥当。后来郑先生举了大量的史料，证明“清官”是由皇帝鉴定的，是由地主阶级吹捧起来的。这就取消了原来的问题。
    说“清官”“清如水，明如镜”，就是说，他比较不贪赃枉法，断官司比较能持平。在封建社会中，贪官、赃官、糊涂官，实在到处都是，冤狱也到处都是。如果有个别的官，能平反几件冤狱，在当时是可以使人心一快。平反了个别的冤狱，对个别人有好处，但对于农民阶级并不会有多大好处。
    “清官”的这些行动，说不上改良主义，更不是象吴晗同志所说的那样“撞击封建制度的基础”。恰恰相反，“清官”的行动是卫护封建制度的基础的。“清官”无论是真“清”或假“清”，他总是“官”。封建制度是他存在的根据。我们应当根据具体情况来评价“清官”，对“清官”不能宣扬。对于“清官”大肆吹捧，其目的是美化封建法律、封建道德、封建制度。这是封建统治阶级麻醉人民的一种手段。
    翁独健：从历史条件来看，比贪官较好的“清官”是有的。统治阶级提倡“清官”，人民中也有“清官”的概念。
    “清官”从本质上说也是封建统治阶级的工具。这一点，现在已经没有不同的意见了。现在还存在一些问题：
    第一、历史上究竟有没有“清官”？从“清官”是剥削阶级来说，都是剥削，有什么“清”不“清”？这样，也可以说没有“清官”。但是，从历史条件来看，从剥削阶级内部来分，相对地说，还是有“清官”的。他们在“合法”的范围内进行剥削，同贪官相比，是统治阶级中较有远见的成员。我们看问题要从历史条件来看，从他们本阶级来说，比贪官较好的“清官”是有的。当然，历史上的“清官”不多，而且有真假之分。特别是戏剧、小说中所渲染的“清官”，那更不是历史的真实。
    统治阶级提倡“清官”，这不成问题。从历史条件看，人民中有没有“清官”的观念呢？我看也有。这并不奇怪。
    第二、“清官”与贪官哪一个好？从一定历史条件的具体情况看，相对地说，“清官”和贪官是有区别的。“清官”总比贪官好一点。个别的冤狱是平了，对人民有一些好处。“清官”比贪官好，自然是有限度的，影响历史发展的不是他们，就是研究统治阶级的历史，“清官”也排不上队。我们从一定的历史条件看，可以说“清官”比贪官好，但是把他们抽象出来，叫今天的人去学习他们，我认为是不对的。
    杜任之：限制贪污中饱是产生“清官”的社会根源；儒家学说是“清官”的思想根源。对“清官”和贪官都要一分为二。
    历史上“清官”还是有的，他们是相对于贪官而言的。历史记载上的“清官”，是统治阶级加以吹捧、士大夫加以夸大而塑造成的。中国是长期的中央集权统治的封建社会，有一套完整的统治机构，层次很多，在剥削农民的劳动果实方面，很容易发生贪污中饱的现象，封建统治者便提倡“清官”以限制贪污中饱，这就是产生“清官”的社会根源。其次，儒家思想是中国长期封建社会的统治思想，儒家思想的基本内容是调和阶级矛盾的“仁学”、“仁政”与折衷主义的“中庸之道”。“清官”的思想根源是从这里来的。
    无产阶级要重新写历史，因之也要重新评价历史人物。一般说来，对“清官”和贪官以及它们所起的作用要一分为二。“清官”和贪官是不同的，这是对封建官吏的一分为二。看待“清官”的作用也要一分为二。“清官”一方面巩固封建统治，起着维护封建统治阶级长远利益的作用；另一方面，在一定事情上，一定时期中，作了有利于一部分人民的好事。这有利于人民的一面又可以一分为二。一方面对人民有利；另一方面又对人民起了欺骗和麻醉的作用，给当时的人民带来了幻想，特别是经过戏曲、小说的渲染，更有麻醉人民的作用。
    对贪官也要一分为二。贪官一方面剥削得更多，压迫得更凶，在当时有害于人民；另一方面又引起了人民对封建统治的憎恨，起了促进人民反抗封建统治的作用。这又是坏事变好事。这就是在这个问题上的肯定与否定的矛盾辩证法的发展。
    朱光潜：封建统治阶级提倡“清官”，是为了对人民起麻痹作用。我们今天还有什么必要把“清官”和贪官区别开来？
    究竟有没有“清官”？大家刚才都是从历史上说的。过去历史的这笔糊涂账，究竟可信到什么程度？不必谈古，就从我们自己经历过的事情想想也可以。我快七十岁了，经历了清朝末年、袁世凯、北洋军阀，直到蒋介石的统治时代。就我知道的官想了一想，究竟哪一个是“清官”？找不出来！要不要把“清官”和贪官区别开来？大家说“清官”是皇帝“钦定”的，封建统治者提倡“清官”，是为了他们的统治利益，对人民起麻痹作用。封建统治者把“清官”和贪官分开来，对他们是有好处的。我们今天从马克思主义的观点来研究历史，有什么必要把“清官”和贪官区别开来？这对我们说明历史究竟有多大好处？
    马克思说过，资本家要尽量剥削工人，但还要给工人最低限度的生活资料，以便继续剥削他们。我想，过去一切剥削阶级对劳动人民都是这样，都有一个既要尽量剥削他们，又要使他们维持最低限度的生活条件，以便继续剥削他们的矛盾。贪官是剥削到底，不管人民的死活；“清官”剥削到一定的程度，使农民能够活下去，继续受剥削。
    翦伯赞：“清官”问题不可轻视。“清官”在历史上是找不出来的。在“清官”与贪官之间画出一条界线是很困难的。建议解剖几个“清官”，弄清真象。
    “清官”问题并不小，不可轻视。尽管“清官”在历史上不占多大地位，但对“清官”的认识，却攸关着对历史人物评价的原则。而且“清官”问题还不仅是一个历史学上的问题，又是文学和戏剧学上的问题。
    对“清官”的本质，已经没有分歧的意见，现在存在着这样一个问题，即“清官”与贪官谁好？要解决这个问题，首先要研究一下刚才一位同志提出的历史上到底有没有“清官”？历史上是写了一些“清官”的，问题就是这些写在历史上的“清官”，算不算“清官”。
    司马迁在《史记·循吏传》中写了一个“清官”公仪休。公仪休是鲁国的博士，以高第为鲁相，他爱吃鱼，有人投其所好，送鱼给他，他不受。说：“今为相能自给鱼，今受鱼而免，谁复给我鱼者，吾故不受也。”这个故事，很清楚地说明了公仪休不是不贪，而是怕因小贪失去大贪的地位。
    真正的“清官”在历史上是找不出来的，因而要想在“清官”与贪官之间画出一条界线是很困难的。如果一定要画，那不是“清”与贪的问题，而是贪的多少问题。
    有些文章提出“清官”奉法，贪官枉法，好象从这里可以画出界线。《史记·酷吏传》记载杜周治狱，只按皇帝的意图，不按法律。有人责备他，他说：“三尺法安在哉？前主所是著为律，后主所是疏为令，当时为是，何古之法乎？”这几句话说出了封建时代法律的本质，也说明了奉法与枉法的区别只是一个是遵循前主之所是，一个是遵循后主之所是而已，前主与后主都是封建皇帝，因而实质上都是执行封建统治阶级的律令，去剥削人民，压迫人民，巩固封建地主阶级的阶级统治。
    为了更深入地展开“清官”问题的讨论，我建议解剖几个封建史学家所宣传的“清官”，看看他们是不是真正的“清官”，“清”在那里，“清”到什么程度。也解剖几个贪官，看看他们与“清官”有多大的差距。同时，对那些宣扬“清官”的公案小说，也翻出来评论评论，指出封建文人是怎样而且为了什么目的制造这些“清官”。
