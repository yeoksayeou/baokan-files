    A Brief Discussion on the Reform of Financial Rules and Regulations
    Chai Yanxie
    Unification and Decentralization, Restriction and Promotion

    Enterprise financial systems are formulated according to the basic principles of "centralizing major powers and decentralizing minor powers" and "unified leadership, hierarchical management." This is a principle for correctly handling the relationship between the state and enterprises, the whole and the part. Whether there is more or less unification, more or less decentralization, is all for better serving production and promoting the development of production. However, enterprise production is not isolated; production is social production. If social production is not well organized, even if one enterprise produces well, it will not solve the problem. Therefore, when dealing with the issue of unification and decentralization, from the perspective of an enterprise, it is necessary to proceed from the entire national economy, from social production, and have a global perspective; otherwise, it will lead to decentralism and hinder the planned economy. From the perspective of superiors, attention should be paid to the actual needs of enterprises. For some specific issues that do not involve national balance, power should be delegated to enterprises. Failing to decentralize when it should be decentralized, and not giving enterprises a certain degree of flexibility, is detrimental to enterprise production, to the correct implementation of state plans, and to the development of overall production. Therefore, the extent of unification and decentralization should not be considered from the local perspective of an enterprise, but from a global perspective, with the 650 million people and the world revolution in mind. Decentralization that benefits both the overall situation and the local enterprise should be implemented; if it only benefits the enterprise and is detrimental to the overall situation, it should not be implemented. The same principle applies to the extent of unification.

    Rules and regulations have both promotional and restrictive aspects. Ultimately, they are all for promoting production development. When considering promotion, one must think of restriction; when considering restriction, one must also consider promotion. Restriction is also for promotion; it is not passive, but rather limits the negative, transforms the negative into the positive, and promotes production development. Therefore, reforming rules and regulations is not about eliminating restrictions; it is about making restrictions more reasonable and more practical. Some comrades see unification as restriction and decentralization as promotion, which is an incomplete understanding. Unification is to ensure necessary centralization; without centralization, there would be no socialist planned economy. Unification is to promote the overall production, which of course drives the local production. Related to this, some comrades equate financial strength with financial power, believing that more money means more power and less money means less power. This statement has some truth, but it is not entirely accurate. There is both a connection and a distinction between financial strength and financial power. If the enterprise is given a lot of money, but the use of the money is specified in every detail, and the enterprise is not allowed to handle it flexibly, then having money is the same as having no power. Of course, allowing enterprises to have the power to handle funds flexibly without giving them funds makes financial power just empty talk. Financial rules and regulations solve the problem of the division of rights and responsibilities; the amount of money is a matter of the distribution of financial resources. The two are different. The arrangement of financial resources changes with the development of the political and economic situation; the division of financial power is determined by the planned economy and the socialist relations of production of public ownership, and cannot be arbitrarily exceeded. The contradiction between needs and possibilities is long-term. The needs of enterprises cannot be infinitely satisfied. Therefore, from the perspective of enterprises, they should look inward and act according to how much money they have, adhering to the spirit of doing more with less money, and focusing their efforts on how to use limited funds well and where it matters most.

    Complexity and Simplicity

    The philosophical complexities in financial rules and regulations must be eliminated, and efforts should be made to simplify them. However, the simplification of rules and regulations is not equal to simplification, but rather should be scientific, concise, and accessible. Complexity and simplicity are relative and should not be viewed from a formal perspective, but from a substantive perspective. The standard for complexity and simplicity lies in whether it truly serves production, that is, whether it serves the masses. Therefore, for our financial personnel, simplifying financial rules and regulations is not only to enable ourselves to step out of the office, but more importantly, to better serve the masses and better serve the organization of production. If this point of view is not clear, simplification becomes oversimplification, making it incomprehensible and unusable, and unable to solve the needs of organizing production. For example, the capital balance sheet used to be a large sheet with a lot of indicators, very complicated. Later, it was simplified, and a large portion of the numbers were reduced. It was simplified, but it was incomprehensible and did not solve the problem of serving the organization of production. As a result, the purpose of simplification was not achieved. Therefore, simplification cannot only focus on the number of subjects, accounts, and indicators, but must solve substantive problems, making it clear at a glance and able to play a role. Taking reports as an example, the numbers must be able to speak. Financial reports must serve production and should be designed differently for different audiences. Those for leaders should meet the requirements of leaders, and those for the masses should meet the requirements of the masses. Anything that does not meet the needs, even if it only has a few indicators, is philosophical complexity. It now seems that to correctly solve the problem of complexity and simplicity, the first thing is to have a service-oriented viewpoint in our thinking, and to clarify the target of the service; otherwise, the problem of simplification cannot be solved well. Even if it is simplified, it is still metaphysical and philosophical complexity.

    The complexity and simplicity of financial procedures and accounting procedures should be done in a way that is both conducive to strengthening management and convenient for others. Necessary procedures should not be omitted; otherwise, loopholes will occur. Therefore, it is necessary to be realistic and have a scientific attitude. The problem of simplification should be addressed by summarizing experiences, finding the root cause, and solving the problem from the root. To achieve true conciseness, accessibility, and ease of understanding, we must rely on everyone to study and put in hard work. If rules and regulations are reformed well and implemented well, it will play a significant role in promoting the revolutionization of financial work.

    财务规章制度改革小议
    柴砚协
    统与放，制约与促进
    企业财务制度是根据“大权独揽、小权分散”、“统一领导，分级管理”的基本原则来制订的。这是一个正确地处理国家与企业、整体与局部的关系的原则。统多统少，放多放少，都是为了更好地为生产服务，促进生产的发展。但是，企业的生产不是孤立的，生产是社会的生产，社会生产组织得不好，一个企业生产再好，也不解决问题。所以，对待统与放的问题，从一个企业来说，要从整个国民经济出发，从社会生产出发，要有全局观点，否则，就会出现分散主义，妨碍计划经济。从上级来说，应该注意企业的实际需要，对一些具体的不涉及到全国平衡的问题，就应该把权力下放给企业。该放而不放，不给企业以一定的灵活性，对于企业的生产是不利的，对于正确执行国家计划是不利的，对于整个生产发展也是不利的。因此，统多统少，放多放少，不能从企业局部考虑，要从全局考虑，从六亿五千万人民，从世界革命着眼。放，既有利于全局，又有利企业局部的，就放；如果，只对企业有利，对全局不利的，就不能放。对待统多统少，也是这个原则。
    规章制度有促进性，有制约性。归根到底，都是为了促进生产发展。考虑促进的时候，要想到制约；考虑制约的时候，也要考虑促进。制约也是为了促进，制约不是消极的，而是限制消极，变消极为积极，促进生产发展。所以，改革规章制度，不是为了取消限制性、制约性，而是要制约得更合理，更切合实际。有的同志把统看成是制约，把放看为促进，这种认识不全面。统是为了保证必要的集中，没有集中，就没有社会主义的计划经济。统是为了促进全局的生产，当然也就带动了局部的生产。与此相联系的是，有的同志把财力同财权等同起来，钱多就是权大，钱少就是权小，这种说法有一定道理，但不完全。财力同财权，两者之间既有联系，又有区别。如果给企业的钱虽然多，但样样都指定了用途，不准企业灵活处理，有钱也还是没有权。当然，允许企业有灵活处理的权力，而不给企业资金，财权也只能是一句空话。财务规章制度解决的是权责划分问题，钱多钱少是财力的分配问题，两者是有区别的。财力的安排，随着政治经济形势的发展而变化；财权的划分，则由计划经济和全民所有制生产关系决定的，不能任意超越。需要与可能的矛盾是长期存在的，企业的需要不可能无限满足，因而，从企业来说，就要眼睛向自己，按照有多少钱办多少事，少花钱多办事的精神，要把劲使在如何把有限的资金用好，用到刀刃上去。
    繁与简
    财务规章制度中的烦琐哲学，一定要革掉，要力求简化。但是，规章制度的简化，不等于简单化，而是要科学、要简明、通俗。繁与简是相对的，不能从形式看，要从实质看。繁与简的标准，在于是否真正为生产服务，也就是说，是否为群众服务。所以，对我们财务人员来说，简化财务规章制度不仅是为了使自己能走出办公室，更重要的是为了更好地为群众服务，更好地为组织生产服务。这个观点不明确，简化变成简单化了，使人家看不懂，用不上，不能解决组织生产需要的问题。譬如，资金平衡表，过去一大张，指标一大堆，很烦琐，后来一简化，数字减去了一大半，简是简了，但是看不懂，没有解决为组织生产服务的问题，结果是没有达到简化的目的。因此，简化不能光在科目、账表、指标的数量上打转转，而是要解决实质问题，要使人看了一目了然，能发挥作用。拿报表来说，要使数字能说话，财务报表要为生产服务，就要区别不同的对象来设计，供领导用的，要适合领导的要求，供群众看的，要适合群众的要求。凡是不合需要的，那怕只有几个指标，也是烦琐哲学。现在看来，要正确解决繁与简的问题，首先在于思想上要有一个服务的观点，要明确服务的对象，否则简化的问题，就解决不好。即使简了，也还是形而上学的，烦琐哲学的。
    财务手续繁简和核算手续的繁简，要做到既有利于加强管理，又能方便人家。该要的手续不要，是会出漏子的。因此，要实事求是，要有科学态度。简化的问题，要总结经验，找出根子，从根子上解决问题。要做到真正的简明、通俗、易懂，要靠大家来研究，要下一番苦功夫。规章制度改革得好，执行得好，对促进财务工作革命化有重大作用。
