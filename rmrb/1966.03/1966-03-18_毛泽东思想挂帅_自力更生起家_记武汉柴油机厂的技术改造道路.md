    Hold High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Start from Self-Reliance
    --An Account of the Technical Transformation Road of the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory
    Editor's Note: The victory of the technical transformation of the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory is a victory of grasping class struggle to promote the struggle for production.
    In the two years of technical transformation, the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory experienced a series of serious struggles: After accepting the task of producing diesel engines, should they be greedy for large scale and foreign methods, and reach out to the state? Or should they be simple and crude, and start from self-reliance? When formulating the technical transformation plan, should they passively wait for material conditions, and be inactive in the face of difficulties? Or should they carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and be heroic in the face of difficulties? In the process of self-manufacturing special machine tools, should they start from being "decent" and pursue everything new? Or should they start from reality and modify old equipment? In implementing the "three-in-one combination," should technical personnel be the main force, allowing workers to leave practice, go upstairs to combine with technical personnel? Or should workers be the main force, requiring technical personnel to go deep into the field to combine with workers? After producing a large number of special machine tools, should they be satisfied with the status quo and stagnate? Or should they go further on the basis of past achievements? All these are struggles between proletarian ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies. The history of the technical transformation of the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory is a history of highlighting politics to promote production.
    The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the development of all things. Opposition is struggle. The development of an enterprise always experiences such struggles. This struggle, in a socialist society where classes exist, often has the nature of class struggle. The facts of the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory are an example.
    Now, some people still do not understand the correct relationship between politics and professional work, as if paying attention to production and professional work makes it impossible to highlight politics. This is of course a misunderstanding. Comrade Mao Zedong said: Politics is the commander, the soul. This is the most explicit expression of the relationship between politics and the economy, and between politics and all professional work. How can this "soul" of politics exist without the body of production and professional work? What does the commander of politics command? The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory tightly grasped class struggle around the key issues in production and professional work, did ideological work, highlighted politics, and promoted production, truly embodying the great role of politics as the commander and soul of professional work.
    Recently, Wuhan City launched an activity to "Learn from Wuhan Diesel, Catch up with Wuhan Diesel," and factories throughout the city are learning from the advanced experience of the Daqing-style enterprise – the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory.
    The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory originally could only produce products such as cotton gins and tipping trucks. In the past two years, the factory's workers have held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, practiced self-reliance and hard work, armed themselves with self-made equipment, and basically reached the level of producing 10,000 small diesel engines annually with very little state investment.
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have also ventured into new technological fields and achieved two new accomplishments: one is that they have explored a new method of organizing metal processing – "group technology" – which greatly saves equipment used in processing small and medium-sized parts; the other is that they cooperated with Huazhong Institute of Technology to successfully create a new type of diesel engine combustion chamber suitable for China's conditions. This combustion chamber has a simple structure, is easy to manufacture, consumes less fuel, and has a long service life. When installed on the 195-type diesel engine, it can increase the diesel engine's power from 7 horsepower to 8 horsepower, and the quality of the diesel engine has also improved.
    In these two years of leap-forward development in production technology, the mental outlook of the factory's workers has undergone great changes, with the spirit of daring to break through, daring to create, and daring to surpass, and full of revolutionary vigor. A group of talents who can both design and manufacture special equipment has emerged among the workers.
    The basic experience gained by the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory in two years of technical transformation is that all work must be led by Mao Zedong Thought, and technical work must be commanded by politics. They have always taken class struggle as the key link, adhered to the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies, fully carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, striving for strength, and hard work, vigorously grasped the ideological revolutionization of people, and vigorously carried out the technical innovation movement, thereby rapidly changing the face of the enterprise and rapidly realizing the state's tasks. The masses' comments on them are: "They fought a production battle, a technology battle, and first of all, they fought a political battle, a battle of will!"

          The Key Lies in the Revolutionary Leadership's Ideology
    Whether technical work can be ideologically leading depends first on whether the factory leadership takes politics as the commander and has a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for strength. The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory has a deep understanding of this. In the past, they took a long detour because they did not correctly solve this problem.
    At the end of 1957, the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory was still a small alley factory. Under the ideological guidance of accelerating agricultural modernization, they used old belt-driven machine tools to trial-produce China's first walking tractor, which was praised and supported by all parties. The scale of the factory has therefore been greatly developed. Later, the higher authorities approved them to specialize in the production of the heart of the tractor – the 195-type diesel engine. Everyone hoped that they would continue to exert their revolutionary vigor and produce products as soon as possible to equip a large number of walking tractors for the countryside.
    However, the leading cadres of this factory believed that the factory's equipment was poor and its technology was low. Without purchasing a large number of sophisticated equipment and increasing a large number of senior technicians and technical personnel, it would not be possible to produce complex products such as diesel engines in batches. Holding the idea of "greed for large scale and foreign methods," they always reached out to the state for money, people, and equipment. If these requirements could not be met, they felt that it would be difficult to move forward. The higher-level leaders asked them to learn from the advanced factories of the same type in Shanghai – the Chengfu Power Machine Factory. They went five times, but they always felt that there was nothing good to learn from others. Because of this, they became less and less competitive. In 1963, they collaborated with another factory to "trial-produce" six samples, and it took them more than a year to barely produce them. The old workers were very angry and said that the factory had "leaders who were lazy, workers who were tired, and equipment that was worn out" in recent years.
    Obviously, if the factory's leadership did not put politics in command, it would be impossible to produce diesel engines according to the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    At the end of 1963, the higher-level leading organs sent new leading cadres to form a new Party committee, and the factory's employees launched activities to learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and learn from Shanghai. At that time, Yu Zhian (now the factory director), the deputy factory director sent to Shanghai to learn advanced experience, and a group of old workers realized that the decisive factors in doing revolution and construction are people, not things. If we want to quickly produce the 195-type diesel engine, we must take the road of self-reliance and hard work, like the People's Liberation Army and the people of Daqing. Under this ideological guidance, they discussed and formulated a technical transformation plan, determined to rely on the masses to self-manufacture special machine tools, so that diesel engines could be put into production quickly, and within two years, they would surpass the production level of their counterpart advanced unit – the Shanghai Chengfu Power Machine Factory.
    However, this plan was opposed by some leading cadres of the factory. They did not want to do it themselves and still planned to use the funds for self-made equipment to purchase new general-purpose machine tools. This caused a fierce ideological struggle within the Party committee.
    The struggle actually focused on two questions: "What attitude should we take towards the state's tasks?" and "What should we do when we encounter difficulties?" Should we proceed from China's reality of being poor and blank, strive for strength, rely on our own efforts, fully carry forward the revolutionary fighting spirit of the masses, and work hard to overcome difficulties? Or should we look down on the strength of the masses, look down on our own poor family background, and "like the new and hate the old" and be "greedy for large scale and foreign methods" everywhere? Should we endure great hardships, endure great labor, shoulder heavy burdens, and actively realize the state's tasks? Or should we, as the old workers criticized, passively wait for conditions and "sit back and enjoy the fruits of the revolution"? Two different attitudes reflect the fundamental question of whether to dare to make revolution. In this struggle, the majority of comrades of the new Party committee resolutely criticized some leading cadres in the factory for attaching importance to technology but not to politics, not seeing the power of the people, being depressed in the face of difficulties, and being inactive, and taking an irresponsible attitude towards the state's tasks.
    Through this ideological struggle, the factory Party committee firmly established a new guiding ideology: rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, and start a business with diligence and thrift; if the technology is low, we will work hard to learn and study hard; if the equipment is poor, we will vigorously carry out technical innovation and arm ourselves. When the plan reflecting this idea was announced to the masses, the masses took action. Some leading cadres also went to the work groups, participated in labor, and solved problems.

            "Three-in-One Combination" with Workers as the Main Force
    After the plan to rely on the masses to self-manufacture special machine tools was accepted by the masses, differences arose on "how to self-manufacture." One was done by some technicians, who wanted to design and manufacture everything new. One was done by old workers, starting from the factory's poor family background, focusing on benefiting from waste and old equipment, and modifying old equipment, emphasizing practicality.
    This difference was first exposed in the design of the eight-hole boring machine. When the technician Zhao Haiyin accepted the design task, the chief engineer told him to make a "decent" one. What is "decent"? It is automatic, hydraulic, combined, and brand new. He locked himself in the design room, checked materials, calculated data, and drew drawings, but even he himself believed that this method was too complex in structure, and even if it was designed, Wuhan City might not be able to manufacture it in two or three years. On the contrary, several old workers who had returned from studying in Shanghai proposed a plan to piece together three old equipment. Zhao Haiyin believed that this plan was feasible, so he expressed at the drawing review meeting that he was willing to work with the old workers to implement the plan proposed by the workers. Zhao Haiyin combined with the workers, designing and transforming at the same time, and it only took three months to assemble a new machine tool from the old machine tools. As soon as this machine tool was started, eight cutter bars moved in three directions at the same time, and eight holes were processed in fifteen minutes, which was more than thirty times more efficient than the original one hole at a time. Which plan is more in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical? The facts made the best answer.
    While educating the masses with this incident, the factory leadership was also inspired. Why do some technicians always "like the new and hate the old" and "greed for large scale and foreign methods"? After further analysis, they believed that technicians generally have two weaknesses: being divorced from politics, and a purely technical viewpoint; being divorced from reality and the masses, "book worship." If these two problems are not solved, they cannot break through the shackles of the "foreign framework," cannot correctly understand the party's guidelines and policies, and other ideological problems will be difficult to solve thoroughly.
    In order to help technicians solve these problems and realize ideological revolutionization, the factory held a technical work conference in April 1964, organized technicians to study Chairman Mao's works "On Practice" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and summarized the work in conjunction with the physical exhibition.
    This study made the vast majority of technicians in the factory realize that correct ideas come from practice; intellectuals must combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants to become revolutionary. Some technicians reviewed that the "three-in-one combination" they had done in the past was to invite old workers upstairs to "combine." This "three-in-one combination" with technicians as the main force allowed old workers to turn over materials, calculate data, and engage in "book worship," which was divorced from production reality and the practical experience of old workers. They said that they had "combined" like this for more than half a year in 1963, but they compiled some inapplicable process documents and designed some inapplicable process equipment, causing great waste.
    Through these examples, the technicians deeply realized that: the "three-in-one combination" must take the production site as the position, with workers as the main force, in order to promote the revolutionization of technicians and promote the development of technical innovation. After this meeting, the technicians went to the production teams and worked with the workers, studied the problems in production together, engaged in technical innovation, and realized the plan to produce diesel engines in batches.
    Leading cadres and technical personnel going to the site to implement the three-in-one combination with workers made it possible to solve some long-standing technical problems more smoothly. Everyone had a common understanding on the basis of common practice, and many guidelines and policies could be smoothly implemented, and the technical innovation movement also developed healthily.

          Constantly Arming the Masses Ideologically
    The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory relied on workers to vigorously carry out the "three-in-one combination," mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers to participate in technical innovation, and a new situation emerged in the factory where "everyone contributes ideas and merits to the diesel engine." Many technical innovation "pioneers" emerged in the movement. Under the ideological guidance of making innovation for the revolution, the old worker Zhong Daoan cooperated with everyone to produce seven special machine tools and a large number of special fixtures. Shu Chuanmo, who is known as a "innovation enthusiast," always said that the more he used his brain, the more enlightened he became. He buried himself in hard work and designed and manufactured many equipments such as pipe benders, hydraulic presses, and oil pump test benches, changing the production appearance of the final assembly workshop. Yang Maolin, an old worker who usually did not like to talk much, silently collected waste materials that others did not use and pieced together a small bed. Those who participated in technical innovation included workers, technicians, skilled workers, and apprentices. They manufactured more than 200 special machine tools in one year, creating conditions for the mass production of diesel engines.
    However, at this time, some people said, "Innovation has been almost completed," their thinking has slackened, and the number of innovation projects has decreased significantly.
    The factory leadership analyzed this situation and realized that in order for all work to continue to move forward, they must insist on highlighting politics every step of the way and arm the masses ideologically in a timely manner. They led everyone to summarize the work with the method of dividing one into two, affirmed the achievements, identified the gaps, and put forward new goals: change low precision to high precision, change low efficiency to high efficiency, universally adopt new processes and new technologies, and move towards automation.
    In order to enhance the workers' fighting spirit, the factory leadership reorganized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and other relevant documents, helped everyone establish the viewpoint of "learning with the spirit of 'creating' and catching up with the spirit of 'surpassing'." And they organized 90% of the workers to go to more than 20 factories in Wuhan City to learn advanced experience, be inspired, and be educated. After the workers throughout the factory were further armed ideologically, they worked hard to carefully think and generally rectify the original self-made equipment, and newly made more than 30 special machine tools.
    When they shifted from trial production to mass production of diesel engines, when they increased from 12 units per day to 20 units per day, some work groups with weak equipment capabilities had ideological shocks, worried that their work groups would not be able to keep up with the new requirements, and hoped to prepare well before increasing production. In this case, the factory organized everyone to discuss the question of "Should we learn to swim in the water, or should we go into the water after we have learned it?" so that everyone could unify their understanding to "test in practice and improve in practice." With such an understanding, the workers were able to actively discover weaknesses in the new production requirements and take measures to strengthen the work on the weak links. The ten-hole cover plate produced by the cover group was originally drilled one by one, and it took more than 20 minutes to process one, which could not keep up with other work groups. In the several leaps in production throughout the factory, they first made a three-hole drill, then a four-hole drill, and finally a ten-hole drill, which greatly improved production capacity and could process a cover plate in one minute. Everyone was very interested in this method of "taking the task to improve the level and promoting innovation through production," and a "four-not-find" activity was launched throughout the factory (problems that workers can solve, do not look for groups; problems that groups can solve, do not look for workshops; problems that workshops can solve, do not look for the factory; problems that the factory can solve, do not look for the competent bureau), making the spirit of self-reliance further developed.
    In this technical innovation movement, many workers deeply realized that: "Production is struggle, we must dare to break through, dare to create, dare to surpass, and dare to win." It is precisely because they have this revolutionary spirit that there are more and better innovation projects. Inspired by learning from Shanghai, they made a simple structure of the valve grinding machine, which is more efficient than Shanghai, and can grind one in half an hour. Hubei Diesel Engine Factory made improvements on their basis, and the efficiency was doubled. Later, they learned back from the Hubei Diesel Engine Factory and reformed again, and the efficiency reached three in eight minutes. This is exactly as the "innovation enthusiast" Shu Chuanmo said: "Learning advanced experience must use your brain, have your own creation, it is not interesting to take the old road, it is more and more interesting to take the new road."
    In the past two years, the number of people participating in technical innovation in this factory has reached more than 70% of the total number of employees. They have not only self-made more than 170 special machine tools and more than 1,000 sets of process equipment, but also produced a large number of talents. Some technicians have begun to have practical experience, so that the vast majority of their designs can meet production needs; more than 90 workers throughout the factory have achieved the ability to both manufacture and design, becoming a strong backbone force in production technology.
    The achievements of the Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory in relying on the masses to conduct technical transformation through self-reliance are a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a result of highlighting politics. Recently, through the socialist education movement and through systematic summary of experience, this factory has further understanding of highlighting politics. At present, all the factory's employees are further launching a heat wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and are determined to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to move forward.

    毛泽东思想挂帅　自力更生起家
    ——记武汉柴油机厂的技术改造道路
    编者按：武汉柴油机厂技术改造的胜利，是抓阶级斗争促进生产斗争的胜利。
    武汉柴油机厂在两年多的技术改造中，经历了一系列严重斗争：在接受生产柴油机的任务以后，是贪大求洋、向国家伸手呢？还是因陋就简、自力更生呢？在制定技术改造规划的时候，是消极等待物质条件，在困难面前无所作为呢？还是发扬群众革命精神，在困难面前逞英雄呢？在自制专用机床的过程中，是从“象样”出发，一切求新呢？还是从实际出发，改制旧设备呢？在实行“三结合”的过程中，是以技术人员为主，让工人脱离实践，上楼同技术人员结合呢？还是以工人为主，要技术人员深入现场同工人结合呢？在制作出大批专用机床以后，是满足现状停滞不前呢？还是百尺竿头更进一步呢？凡此种种，都是无产阶级思想同各种非无产阶级思想的斗争。武汉柴油机厂技术改造的历史，就是突出政治推动生产的历史。
    对立统一的规律，是一切事物发展的根本规律。对立就是斗争，一个企业的发展，总是要经历这样那样的斗争。这种斗争，在存在着阶级的社会主义社会中，常常带有阶级斗争的性质。武汉柴油机厂的事实就是一个实例。
    现在，有些人还不懂得政治和业务的正确关系，好象注意了生产业务就不能突出政治。这当然是一种误解。毛泽东同志说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。这是对政治同经济、政治同一切业务关系的最明确的表述。离开生产业务这个躯体，政治这个“灵魂”怎么能存在呢？政治这个统帅还统帅什么呢？武汉柴油机厂紧紧围绕着生产业务中的关键性问题抓阶级斗争，作思想工作，突出了政治，推动了生产，真正体现了政治是业务的统帅、是业务的灵魂的伟大作用。
    最近，武汉市展开了一个“学武柴、赶武柴”的活动，全市工厂都在学习大庆式企业——武汉柴油机厂的先进经验。
    武汉柴油机厂原来只能生产轧花机、翻斗车之类的产品。两年来，这个工厂的职工高举毛泽东思想红旗，自力更生，勤俭创业，自制设备武装自己，只用了很少的国家投资便基本上达到年产一万台小型柴油机的水平。
    他们还在毛泽东思想指导下闯进新的技术领域，取得了两项新成就：一项是探索出了一套组织金属加工的新方法——“成组加工”，大大节省了加工中小件所用的设备；另一项是他们和华中工学院合作创造成功适合我国情况的新型柴油机燃烧室，这种燃烧室结构简单，制造容易，耗油少，寿命长，装在一九五型柴油机上，可使柴油机功率由七马力提高到八马力，柴油机质量也有了提高。
    在这生产技术飞跃发展的两年里，工厂职工的精神面貌起了很大的变化，敢闯、敢创、敢超，革命干劲十足。工人中已经出现了一批既能设计又能制造专用设备的人才。
    武汉柴油机厂两年技术改造取得的基本经验是：各项工作必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，技术工作必须为政治所统帅。他们始终以阶级斗争为纲，坚持两条道路和两种思想的斗争，充分发扬自力更生、奋发图强、勤俭创业的精神，大抓人的思想革命化，大搞技术革新运动，从而使企业面貌迅速改变，国家任务迅速实现。群众对他们的评论是：“打了一场生产仗，技术仗，首先是打了一场政治仗、志气仗！”
          关键在领导思想先革命
    技术工作能不能做到思想领先，首先要看工厂领导是不是政治挂帅，是否有自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神。对这一点，武汉柴油机厂有着深切的体会。他们过去就是因为没有正确解决好这个问题，结果走了一段很长的弯路。
    一九五七年底，武汉柴油机厂还是一间弄堂工厂，职工们就在加速农业现代化的思想指导下，利用老旧的皮带机床试制出我国第一台手扶拖拉机，受到各方面的赞扬和支持。工厂规模因此有了较大的发展。后来上级又批准他们专门生产拖拉机的心脏——一九五型柴油机。大家都希望他们继续发挥革命干劲，尽早把产品拿出来为农村装配大批手扶拖拉机。
    但是，这个工厂的领导干部却认为，本厂设备差、技术低，不购置大批精良设备，不增加大批高级技工和技术人员，就不能成批生产柴油机这样复杂的产品。他们抱着“贪大求洋”的思想，总是伸手向国家要钱，要人，要设备。这些要求满足不了，他们就认为难以前进。上级领导要他们向上海同类型先进工厂——诚孚动力机厂学习，他们去了五次，可总觉得人家没啥好学的。因为这样，他们越搞越不争气，在一九六三年同别厂协作“试制”六台样品，竟搞了一年多才勉强搞出来。老工人们非常气愤，说工厂这几年是“领导拖懒了，工人拖疲了，设备拖垮了”。
    显然，工厂领导上政治不挂帅，柴油机是不可能按照多快好省的要求生产出来的。
    一九六三年底，上级领导机关派来了新的领导干部，组成了新的一届党委，全厂职工展开了学解放军，学大庆，学上海的活动。当时，派往上海学习先进经验的副厂长于志安（现任厂长）和一批老工人认识到搞革命搞建设，决定的因素是人而不是物。要想迅速生产出一九五型柴油机，就要象解放军和大庆人那样走自力更生、勤俭创业的道路。他们在这种思想指导下，讨论制订了一个技术改造规划，决心依靠群众自制专用机床，使柴油机迅速上马，并在两年内超过他们的对口先进单位——上海诚孚动力机厂的生产水平。
    但是，这个规划遭到了工厂某些领导干部的反对。他们不想自己动手，仍然打算把自制设备的经费用去购买新的通用机床。这样就在党委会内引起了一场激烈的思想斗争。
    斗争实际上集中在“对国家任务采取什么态度”和“有了困难怎么办”两个问题上：是从我国一穷二白的实际情况出发，奋发图强，自力更生，充分发扬群众的革命战斗精神，努力克服困难呢，还是看不起群众的力量，看不起自己的穷家底，处处“喜新厌旧”、“贪大求洋”？是吃大苦，耐大劳，挑重担，积极实现国家任务呢？还是象老工人批评的那样，消极等待条件，“坐享革命成果”？两种不同的态度反映着敢不敢革命的根本问题。新的党委会的大多数同志在这场斗争中坚决批判了厂内某些领导干部的重技术不重政治，看不见人的力量，在困难面前精神不振、无所作为，对国家任务抱着不负责任的错误态度。
    通过这场思想斗争，工厂党委牢固地确立起一个新的指导思想：依靠群众，自力更生，勤俭创业；技术低，就努力学，努力钻；设备差，就大搞技术革新，自己武装自己。反映这个思想的规划一向群众宣布，群众就纷纷行动起来。一些领导干部也分头下到班组，参加劳动，解决问题。
            以工人为主“三结合”
    依靠群众自制专用机床的规划为群众接受了，又发生了“怎样自制”的分歧。一种是有些技术人员搞的，什么都要新设计，新制造。一种是老工人搞的，从本厂的穷家底出发，以利废利旧，改制旧设备为主，讲求实效。
    这个分歧首先在设计八孔镗床中暴露出来了。技术员赵海音接受设计任务时，总工程师就向他讲，要搞个“象样”的。什么是“象样”的呢？是自动的、液压的、组合的、全新的。他关在设计室里，查资料，算数据，绘图纸，可是连他自己也认为这样做结构太复杂，就是设计出来了，武汉市也不一定能在两三年内制造出来。相反，从上海学习回来的几个老工人却提出了用三台旧设备拼成的方案。赵海音认为这个方案倒是切实可行，便在图纸审查会上表示，他愿意和老工人们一起实现工人提出来的方案。赵海音同工人结合起来，边设计，边改造，只花了三个月的时间，便用旧机床拼成了一台新机床。这台机床一开动，八个刀杆在三个方向同时进刀，十五分钟加工出八个孔，比原来一个孔一个孔地干，工效提高三十多倍。究竟是哪个方案符合多快好省的精神？事实作出了最好的回答。
    工厂领导在用这件事教育群众的同时，自己也受到了启发。为什么一些技术人员总爱“喜新厌旧”，“贪大求洋”？他们经过进一步的分析认为：技术人员一般存在两个弱点：脱离政治，单纯技术观点；脱离实际，脱离群众，“本本主义”。这两个问题不解决，他们就不能突破“洋框框”的束缚，不能正确领会党的方针政策，其他思想问题也很难得到彻底解决。
    为了帮助技术人员解决这些问题，实现思想革命化，全厂在一九六四年四月召开了技术工作会议，组织技术人员学习毛主席著作《实践论》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等文章，并结合实物展览，总结了工作。
    这次学习，使得厂里绝大多数技术人员认识到：正确的思想来自实践；知识分子要革命化就必须同广大工农群众相结合。有些技术人员检查说，他们过去搞的“三结合”，是把老工人请上楼来“结合”。这种以技术人员为主的“三结合”，让老工人翻资料，算数据，搞“本本主义”，既脱离了生产实际，也脱离了老工人的实践经验。他们说，他们在一九六三年这样“结合”了大半年，却编制了一些不适用的工艺文件，设计了一些不适用的工艺装备，造成很大浪费。
    技术人员们通过这些事例，深切地体会到：“三结合”必须以生产现场为阵地，以工人为主，才能促进技术人员革命化，才能促进技术革新的发展。这次会后，技术人员便纷纷下到生产小组，和工人们一起劳动，一起研究生产中的问题，搞技术革新，实现成批生产柴油机的规划。
    领导干部、技术人员到现场去和工人实行三结合，使一些争论不休的技术问题比较顺利地得到解决。大家在共同实践的基础上有了共同的认识，许多方针政策也就能顺利贯彻，技术革新运动也健康地发展起来了。
          不断从思想上武装群众
    武汉柴油机厂依靠工人大搞“三结合”，调动了职工参加技术革新的积极性，全厂出现了“人人为柴油机献策立功”的新局面。运动中涌现出许多技术革新的“闯”将。老工人钟道安，在为革命搞革新的思想指导下，同大家合作搞出了七台专用机床和大批专用夹具。被称为“革新迷”的舒传么，总是说脑筋越动越开窍，埋头苦干，设计、制作出弯管机、油压机、油泵试验台等许多设备，改变了总装车间的生产面貌。平时不爱多说话的老工人杨茂林，也不声不响地到处收集别人不用的废料，拼制出了小占床。参加技术革新的，既有工人，又有技术员，既有技工，又有徒工，一年里就制作出二百多台专用机床，为柴油机成批生产创造了条件。
    但是，这时却有人讲：“已经革新得差不多了”，思想松懈下来，革新项目显著减少。
    工厂领导分析了这种情况，认识到要使各项工作继续前进，就必须坚持每走一步都突出政治，及时从思想上武装群众。他们领导大家以一分为二的方法总结工作，肯定成绩，找出差距，并且提出了新的奋斗目标：改低精度为高精度，改低工效为高工效，普遍采用新工艺，新技术，向自动化迈进。
    为了增强职工的斗志，工厂领导重新组织大家学习毛主席著作和其他有关文件，帮助大家树立“以‘创’的精神去学，以‘超’的精神去赶”的观点。并且组织百分之九十的职工到武汉市二十多个工厂去学习先进经验，受启发，受教育。全厂职工思想上进一步武装起来后，又勤思苦想，将原有自制设备普遍加以整顿，并且新制成了三十多台专用机床。
    当他们由试制转为成批生产柴油机的时候，当他们由日产十二台上升为日产二十台的时候，一些设备能力薄弱的班组都在思想上有过震动，耽心自己班组跟不上新的要求，希望准备好以后再提高产量。遇到这种情况，工厂就组织大家讨论“是到水中去学游泳，还是学会了再下水”的问题，使大家统一到“在实践中考验，在实践中提高”的认识上来。职工们有了这样的认识，在新的生产要求中，就能主动地发现薄弱环节，采取措施来加强薄弱环节上的工作。盖壳组生产的十个眼的盖板，原来是一个一个地钻孔，二十多分钟才能加工一个，跟不上别的班组。就在全厂生产的几个飞跃中，他们先搞出了一台三孔钻，以后搞出一台四孔钻，最后又搞出了一台十孔钻，使生产能力大大提高，一分钟便能加工一个盖板。大家对这样“以任务带水平，以生产促革新”的办法很感兴趣，在全厂掀起了“四不找”的活动（工人能解决的问题，不找小组；小组能解决的问题，不找车间；车间能解决的问题，不找厂部；厂部能解决的问题，不找主管局），使自力更生精神得到进一步发扬。
    在这场技术革新运动中，许多工人都深切体会到：“生产就是斗争，必须敢闯、敢创、敢超，敢于胜利。”正由于他们具有这种革命精神，革新项目就越来越多，越来越好。他们学上海受到启发，制出了一个结构简单的汽门碾磨机，工效比上海高，半小时能磨一个。湖北柴油机厂在他们这个基础上作了改进，工效提高一倍。后来他们又从湖北柴油机厂学回来，再度改革，工效达到八分钟磨三个。这正象“革新迷”舒传么说的：“学习先进经验就得动脑筋，有自己的创造，走老路没有劲儿，走新路才越干越有味。”
    两年来，这个工厂参加技术革新的人数，达到职工总数的百分之七十以上。他们不仅自制出了一百七十多台专用机床和一千多套工艺装备，而且涌现出大批人才来。一些技术人员开始有了实践经验，使自己的设计绝大多数能符合生产需要；全厂还有九十多名工人做到了既会制造，又会设计，成为一支强大的生产技术骨干队伍。
    武汉柴油机厂依靠群众自力更生进行技术改造取得成就，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是突出政治的结果。最近，这个工厂通过社会主义教育运动，通过系统的总结经验，对突出政治有了进一步的认识。目前，全厂职工正在进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，决心高举毛泽东思想红旗继续前进。
