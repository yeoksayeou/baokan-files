    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The Kenyan Senate passed an anti-China motion on March 1st, viciously attacking Chinese leaders and undermining normal relations between China and Kenya.
    When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Africa in 1964, he mentioned in his speech, in response to the rising anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggles of the African people, that Africa was a scene of great revolutionary promise. In order to further incite anti-China sentiment, imperialism arbitrarily distorted Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, stirring up trouble and sowing discord in some African countries. After this, some English-language newspapers in Kenya, and even some senior officials in government departments, have repeatedly launched malicious attacks on this speech.
    The motion passed by the Kenyan Senate, disregarding the facts, crudely described Premier Zhou Enlai's speech as a "destructive speech," and even purposefully stated that "since that speech, several coups, crises, and assassinations have indeed occurred in some African countries." This motion is clearly trying to absolve imperialism of its guilt and place a "trumped-up" charge on the Chinese people.
    The Chinese Embassy in Kenya submitted a note of protest to the Kenyan government on March 17th regarding this anti-China motion. The note solemnly pointed out that the motion, which forcibly links the series of reactionary coups, assassinations, and other events recently plotted by imperialism in Africa with Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, can only be regarded as a conspiracy to poison normal relations between the two countries. The note also pointed out that the Kenyan government should bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this motion.

    肯尼亚参院竟通过反华动议蓄意破坏两国关系
    我驻肯大使馆向肯政府提出抗议
    肯政府必须对由此引起的一切后果负完全责任
    新华社三十日讯  肯尼亚参议院三月一日通过了一个反华动议，恶毒地攻击中国领导人，破坏中、肯两国之间的正常关系。
    周恩来总理在一九六四年访问非洲时，针对非洲人民高涨的反帝反殖革命斗争，曾在讲话中提到非洲是一片大好的革命形势。帝国主义为了进一步煽动反华，对周恩来总理这一讲话任意歪曲，在一些非洲国家中搬弄是非，挑拨离间。在这以后，肯尼亚的一些英文报刊，甚至政府部门的一些高级官员也不止一次地对这一讲话进行了恶意的攻击。
    肯尼亚参议院通过的这个动议竟然不顾事实，粗暴地把周恩来总理这一讲话说成是“破坏性的讲话”，甚至别有用心地说什么“自从那次讲话以后，在一些非洲国家中确实发生了若干起政变、危机和暗杀事件”。这一动议分明是在为帝国主义开脱罪责，把“莫须有”的罪名强加在中国人民头上。
    中国驻肯尼亚大使馆三月十七日就这一反华动议向肯尼亚政府提交了一份抗议照会。照会严正指出，这一动议硬把帝国主义最近在非洲策划的一系列反动政变、暗杀等等事件，同周恩来总理的讲话联系在一起，这只能被认为是毒化两国正常关系的一个蓄谋。照会还指出，由此动议而引起的一切后果，肯尼亚政府应负完全责任。
