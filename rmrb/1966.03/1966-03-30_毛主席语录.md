    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Opposing the spontaneous tendency towards selfish and self-seeking capitalism and advocating the socialist spirit that takes the principle of combining collective interests with individual interests as the standard for all words and actions is the ideological and political guarantee for the gradual transition of the scattered small-peasant economy to a large-scale cooperative economy. This work is arduous and must be done very concretely and meticulously based on the life experience of the peasants. Rough attitudes and simple methods should not be adopted. It must be done in conjunction with economic work, and it cannot be done in isolation.
    Editor's Note to "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"
    The working class must transform the entire society in the struggle of class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself. The working class must constantly learn at work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop.
      "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"

    毛主席语录
    反对自私自利的资本主义的自发倾向，提倡以集体利益和个人利益相结合的原则为一切言论行动的标准的社会主义精神，是使分散的小农经济逐步地过渡到大规模合作化经济的思想的和政治的保证。这一工作是艰巨的，必须根据农民的生活经验，很具体地很细致地去做，不能采用粗暴的态度和简单的方法。它是要结合着经济工作一道去做的，不能孤立地去做。
    《中国农村的社会主义高潮》编者按语
    工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。
      《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》
