    Hangzhou Harvesting "Pre-Qingming Tea"
    The famous Hangzhou Longjing tea region has begun harvesting new tea. In recent days, whenever the weather has been clear, from Lion Peak to Nine Creeks, from Lingyin to Manjuelong, groups of tea-picking girls have been scattered throughout the tea gardens, picking this year's first batch of "Pre-Qingming Tea." This year, the quality of the new Longjing tea is better than in the past, and the "Pre-Qingming Tea" that has already been picked is all of the highest grade. The harvesting time is about half a month earlier than in previous years.

    杭州采摘“明前茶”
    著名的杭州龙井茶区开始采摘新茶。近日来每逢晴天，从狮峰到九溪，从灵隐到满觉陇，一群群的采茶姑娘，散布在茶园里采摘今年第一批“明前茶”。今年龙井新茶质量比过去好，已采摘的“明前茶”都是特级茶。采摘时间比往年提早半个月左右。
