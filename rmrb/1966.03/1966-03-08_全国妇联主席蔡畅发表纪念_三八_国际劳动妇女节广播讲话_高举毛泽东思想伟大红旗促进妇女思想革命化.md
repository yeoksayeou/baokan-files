    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th – Cai Chang, President of the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, today delivered a radio speech to women across the country entitled "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Promote the Ideological Revolutionization of Women" to commemorate this year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    Dear sisters throughout the country! Comrades!

    Today is "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. As we commemorate this glorious festival, our country is presenting an excellent situation, and the socialist revolution and socialist construction have entered a new stage of development. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the whole country are in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. Taking the People's Liberation Army, the people of Daqing, and the people of Dazhai as examples, they are actively engaged in the three great revolutionary movements and are constantly moving from one victory to another. In this great era, women on all fronts in our country have continuously improved their political consciousness, diligently trained themselves in solid skills, made tremendous contributions, and produced countless heroic models. With boundless excitement, on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation, I extend festive greetings to all my sisters throughout the country! I extend revolutionary salute to the activists who study Chairman Mao's writings on all fronts and to the advanced women who have made remarkable achievements in production and work!

    Dear sisters, comrades, now the broad masses of the people in our country have launched an unprecedentedly widespread upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Everyone is studying Chairman Mao's writings extensively and applying Mao Zedong Thought creatively. From the practice of revolution and construction, we have come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism of our time. Insisting on putting Mao Zedong Thought in command and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything is the fundamental guarantee for the Chinese people to victoriously carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to gradually move towards communism. It is the ideological weapon for preventing revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism. Historical facts prove that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding principle for the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, but also a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism and modern revisionism. Without it, we will lose our direction, and we cannot have creativity, foresight, or lofty goals. Therefore, the broad masses of our women and women cadres on all fronts must further raise their revolutionary consciousness and regard Chairman Mao's writings as the supreme instruction for all work, studying and implementing them with great revolutionary enthusiasm. We must adhere to the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's writings, making great efforts in the word "application," while transforming the objective world, we must transform the subjective world, promote continuous ideological revolutionization, and make greater contributions to the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country and to the great cause of supporting the world's people's revolution.

    Dear sisters, comrades, the heroic women of Dazhai and Daqing are our shining examples. They are two bright red flags of giving prominence to politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the Party, they constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, are wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, and adhere to the socialist direction; they never forget the bitterness of class and always remember class hatred, stand firm, and have clear-cut love and hatred. They constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against capitalist ideology and feudal remnants, and with their revolutionary actions, they have overcome various old ideas and old habits that look down on women, and have trained themselves to become conscious revolutionaries and laborers; they have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, hard struggle, and building the country through diligence and thrift. With their own hands, they do practical work, hard work, and clever work. No matter how hard the labor is, no matter how difficult the conditions are, they can overcome all difficulties, implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and constantly achieve victories. They have the motherland in their hearts and the world in their eyes. They think of the collective, work for the revolution, love labor, and want diligence and thrift.

    The heroic women of Dazhai, under the leadership of the Dazhai Party Branch, have carried out a struggle to transform the world for more than ten years, constantly overcoming natural disasters and turning the old Dazhai into a new Dazhai. The women of Dazhai cultivate the land for the revolution, love the collective, love the country, and carry forward the communist style. In the face of the serious disaster in 1963, they responded to the call of the Party branch for self-reliance and overcoming the disaster, achieving "three no's": no state relief grain, no relief funds, and no relief materials, leaving the difficulties to themselves and letting the state's support go to fraternal production teams. In overcoming the disaster, the female members and male members fought equally hard, and after the autumn, they reaped a bumper harvest, achieving "three not less": that is, selling 240,000 catties of grain to the state, not a catty less; the collective reserve grain was not less; and the grain distributed to the members was not less. In 1964, the average yield per mu in Dazhai reached more than 800 catties. In 1965, in the face of a severe drought, they still achieved a bumper harvest. The women of Dazhai are a labor force with high political consciousness, mastering advanced production technology, and able to endure great hardships and work hard; at the same time, they are experts in managing the household diligently, carrying forward the fine tradition of diligence and thrift of the working people, linking diligence and thrift in managing the household with self-reliance, and correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The women of Dazhai, together with the male members, have created a path of relying on self-reliance to build a new socialist countryside.

    The female workers of Daqing, like the male workers, have made great contributions in developing the oil field and building the oil field, with hard work, daring to think, and daring to act. The family members of the Daqing workers have set a shining example for the family members of workers across the country in terms of revolutionization and laborization. Here, I would like to introduce to you the situation of the workers' family members. The heroic family members of the Daqing workers resolutely implemented the Daqing Oilfield Party Committee's policy on mining area construction. Starting from the revolution with five iron shovels, now more than 95% of the family members with labor ability in the entire mining area have participated in collective labor. They actively responded to the call of the Party committee, and in addition to participating in industrial production, they also undertook all agricultural and sideline production tasks. Hundreds of production teams in the entire mining area are managed by the family members themselves, and more than 400 tractor drivers and various agricultural machinery operators have been trained. Last year, they cultivated hundreds of thousands of mu of land, harvested more than 40 million catties of grain, more than 30 million catties of vegetables, 250,000 catties of eggs and meat, and also held many service undertakings. Last year, 4,354 five-good family members were selected, 134 became glorious Communist Party members, and 110 joined the Communist Youth League. The family members of Daqing workers have been tempered into a revolutionized, labored, and collectivized force in labor, transforming from consumers into socialist producers, and becoming an indispensable important force in mining area construction. Together with the male and female workers, they have blazed a path of running socialist enterprises well according to Mao Zedong Thought, blazed a path of combining urban and rural areas, combining industry and agriculture, and blazed a path of revolutionizing the family members of workers.

    In recent years, tens of thousands of advanced women who creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought have emerged on all fronts across the country. For example, in the industrial field, there are Feng Yuping, Wei Fengying, and Yang Fuzhen; in the agricultural field, there are Song Liying and Huang Shunyu; in the commercial field, there is Li Suwen; among the workers' family members, there is Xue Guifang; in the People's Liberation Army, there is Yu Fulan; in the militia, there is Huang Meixiu; and in the cultural, educational, and health fields, there is Chen Zhihui, etc. They have all used Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems in their thinking and work, found the laws of work, and made outstanding achievements.

    The above facts show that the broad masses of working-class, peasant, and soldier women, regardless of their level of education, can study Chairman Mao's writings, and many can study well and apply them well. Because they have deep class feelings and an urgent need to study; they have first-hand experience in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They can well understand and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's books are written for all working people. Every word of Chairman Mao points out the direction, tells the truth, and finds the method for revolutionaries. Reading Chairman Mao's books is to continuously improve class consciousness and socialist consciousness, so that our thinking is constantly revolutionized.

    How to further study Chairman Mao's writings well, many of our women have created many good experiences. That is, the purpose of study must be clear, the method must be correct, not afraid of difficulties, and persevere to the end. Comrades like Song Liying, director of the women's congress of Dazhai, Xue Guifang, a model family member of Daqing, and Li Suwen, from the commercial front, are our good examples. They are very busy with production, very busy with work, and have low levels of education, but they study for the revolution, have a high degree of consciousness, study with strong class feelings, study diligently and arduously, and squeeze out all difficulties. In their studies, they always compare themselves with their own thinking, find gaps, find reasons, dare to make self-criticism, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, humbly learn from the advanced experiences of others, constantly promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, constantly break the old and establish the new, and constantly link theory with practice to do a good job in work and production. Therefore, they are making rapid progress. Comrade Song Liying said with deep understanding: "To study Chairman Mao's writings is to remove the word 'I' from one's mind, to eradicate the word 'selfishness' from the root, and to firmly take the road of socialism and communism."

    Comrade Song Liying said very well. Our broad masses of women, in studying Chairman Mao's writings, must use Mao Zedong Thought to further solve the problem of the direction and path of revolution; establish the lofty ideal of building socialism and communism; establish the idea of working for the revolution; use the revolutionary spirit to overcome various difficulties; and have revolutionary thinking methods and working methods. In this way, we can fundamentally improve our consciousness and solve the problem of the revolutionary world outlook.

    Taking this opportunity, I would like to say a few words to the comrades of the women's federations at all levels.

    Our women's federations at all levels, under the leadership of the Party, to promote women's work to a new level, the most fundamental thing is to give prominence to politics. We must organize women to study Chairman Mao's writings, and cadres of women's federations at all levels must study first. Study is not only to educate the masses, but first to transform our own thinking. We must establish a firm proletarian world outlook and serve the people wholeheartedly. Our new cadres must solve the problem of the revolutionary world outlook, and old cadres must also continue to solve this fundamental problem.

    Women's federation cadres must strive to study Chairman Mao's writings, and to make great efforts in the word "application," they must study regularly and repeatedly, forming a system. We must closely integrate study with work. We say that at the work meetings of the women's federations, "discuss important matters and manage one's own business," the first thing is to discuss the important matter of cadres of women's federations at all levels creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, report their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's writings, exchange and summarize experiences, inspire each other, and help each other. We must do as the people of Daqing do, achieving "five combinations," that is: combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the study of the Party's principles and policies; combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the study of the experience of the People's Liberation Army; combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the analysis of the situation and tasks of one's own unit; combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with criticism and self-criticism and the transformation of thinking; and combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the summing up of work experience. We must also take the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu as a component of the study of Chairman Mao's writings. We must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, using the spirit of thorough revolution to transform our thinking, improve our work, and improve our style.

    Women's federation cadres must also, as Chairman Mao often taught, face the grassroots, go deep into the masses, persist in staying at selected points, summarize experience, and guide the overall situation. At present, the main thing is to persist in participating in the socialist education movement, and persist in staying at selected points in the movement. In the movement, persist in studying and leading the masses to consciously study Chairman Mao's writings. At the same time, comrades who manage surface work must also stay at selected points. In these aspects, leading cadres must set an example, take the lead in demonstrating, and not lag behind the masses. We must personally summarize typical experiences, and come up with one or two or several advanced models in our own locality to drive and guide the work on the surface. We must understand that models are the most powerful living examples, coming from the masses and going to the masses, and are the most effective method of combining general calls and individual guidance.

    Dear sisters! Comrades! This year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. We must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry out the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings, actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements, and actively participate in the movement to compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Chinese women are a great human resource. We must tap this resource and strive to build a great socialist country." We must give full play to the great role of the broad masses of women and make greater contributions in the new upsurge of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Let us, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ahead bravely on the road of revolutionization!

    全国妇联主席蔡畅发表纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节广播讲话
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗促进妇女思想革命化
    以大寨大庆妇女为榜样，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作
    新华社七日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅今天向全国妇女发表了题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，促进妇女思想革命化》的广播讲话，纪念今年“三八”国际劳动妇女节。讲话全文如下：亲爱的全国姐妹们！同志们！
    今天是“三八”国际劳动妇女节，当我们纪念这个光辉节日的时候，我们国家呈现着一派大好形势，社会主义革命和社会主义建设进入了新的发展时期。全国人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，以解放军、以大庆人、大寨人为榜样，积极投入了三大革命运动，不断地从一个胜利走向另一个新的胜利。在这伟大的时代，我国各条战线上的妇女们，不断提高政治觉悟，苦练过硬本领，作出了巨大的贡献，涌现出无数英雄模范。我怀着无限兴奋的心情，代表全国妇联向全国姊妹们致以节日的祝贺！向各条战线上学习毛主席著作的积极分子和在生产上、工作上做出显著成绩的先进妇女们，致以革命的敬礼！
    亲爱的姊妹们，同志们，现在我国广大人民群众，已经掀起了一个空前广泛的学习毛主席著作的高潮。大家都在大学毛主席著作，活学活用毛泽东思想。我们从革命和建设的实践中，体会到毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义。坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，是我国人民胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设、逐步走向共产主义的一切工作的根本保证，是防止修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的思想武器。历史事实证明毛泽东思想不仅是中国革命和社会主义建设的指针，而且是世界人民革命斗争的强大思想武器，是战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。离开了它就要迷失方向，就不能有创造，有预见，有远大的奋斗目标。因此，我们广大妇女群众和各个战线上的妇女干部，必须更进一步提高革命的自觉性，把毛主席著作当作各项工作的最高指示，以极大的革命热情去学习、去执行。必须坚持活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，促进思想不断革命化，在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业中，在支援世界人民革命的伟大事业中作出更大的贡献。
    亲爱的姐妹们，同志们，英雄的大寨妇女和大庆妇女，就是我们的光辉榜样。她们是突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想的两面鲜红旗帜。她们在党的领导下，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，一心向党，坚持社会主义方向；时刻不忘阶级苦，牢记阶级恨，立场坚定，爱憎分明。她们用毛泽东思想不断同资本主义思想和封建残余思想作斗争，用自己的革命行动，战胜了各种轻视妇女的旧思想、旧习惯，锻炼成为自觉的革命者和劳动者；她们发扬了自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的革命精神，用自己的双手，实干、苦干、巧干，不管劳动多么艰苦，不管条件多么困难，都能排除万难，贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线而不断取得胜利。她们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，想的是集体，干的是革命，爱的是劳动，要的是勤俭。
    英雄的大寨妇女，她们十几年来，在大寨党支部领导下，和男社员一起，进行了改天换地的斗争，不断战胜自然灾害，把旧大寨变成了新大寨。大寨妇女为革命种田，热爱集体，热爱国家，发扬了共产主义风格。在一九六三年严重的灾害面前，响应党支部提出的自力更生、战胜灾害的号召，做到“三不要”：不要国家救济粮、救济款和救济物资，把困难留给自己，把国家的支援让给兄弟生产队。在战胜灾害中，女社员和男社员们同样苦战，秋后获得了丰收，做到了“三不少”，这就是卖给国家二十四万斤粮食，斤两不少；集体储备粮不少；社员分的粮食也不少。一九六四年大寨亩产量平均达到八百多斤。一九六五年在严重的旱灾面前，仍然获得了丰收。大寨妇女是有高度政治觉悟、掌握了先进生产技术、能吃大苦耐大劳的劳动大军；同时，她们又是勤俭持家的能手，发扬了劳动人民勤劳节俭的优良传统，把勤俭持家和自力更生联系起来，正确处理国家、集体和个人的关系。大寨妇女和男社员一起，创造了依靠自力更生，建设社会主义新农村的道路。
    大庆女职工和男职工一样，在开发油田、建设油田当中，艰苦奋斗、敢想敢干，作出了很大贡献。大庆职工家属在革命化、劳动化方面，为全国职工家属树立了光辉榜样。这里，我向大家介绍一下职工家属的情况。英雄的大庆职工家属，坚决贯彻执行了大庆油田党委的矿区建设方针。从五把铁锹闹革命开始，到现在全矿区百分之九十五以上有劳动能力的家属，都参加了集体劳动。她们积极响应党委的号召，除参加工业生产，还担负起全部农、副业生产的任务。全矿区几百个生产队，都由家属自己管理，并且培养出四百多名拖拉机手和各种农业机械手。去年她们耕种了几十万亩土地，收获了四千多万斤粮食，三千多万斤蔬菜，二十五万斤蛋类和肉食品，还举办了许多服务事业。去年评选了四千三百五十四名五好家属，有一百三十四名成为光荣的共产党员，一百一十人参加了共青团。大庆职工家属在劳动中，已经炼成了一支革命化、劳动化、集体化的大军，从消费者变为社会主义的生产者，成为矿区建设中一支不可缺少的重要力量。她们和男女职工一起，闯出了一条按照毛泽东思想办好社会主义企业的道路，闯出了城乡结合、工农结合的道路，闯出了一条职工家属革命化的道路。
    近几年来，全国各条战线上，都涌现出成千上万活学活用毛主席著作的先进妇女。例如工业方面有冯玉萍、尉凤英、杨富珍，农业方面有宋立英、黄顺玉，商业方面有李素文，职工家属有薛桂芳，解放军有于富兰，民兵有黄美秀，文教卫生方面有陈智慧等等，她们都是运用毛泽东思想解决了思想和工作中的问题，找出了工作的规律，作出了优异的成绩。
    以上事实说明，广大工农兵妇女群众，不管文化高低，都能够学习毛主席著作，很多人能够学得好，用得好。因为她们有深厚的阶级感情，迫切要求学习；她们有阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的亲身体验。她们能够很好地理解和运用毛泽东思想。毛主席的书，是为一切劳动人民写的。毛主席的每一句话，都是为革命的人指方向，讲道理，找方法。读毛主席的书，就是为了不断提高阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟，使我们思想不断革命化。
    怎样进一步学好毛主席著作，我们不少妇女群众，已经创造了许多好的经验。这就是，学习目的要明确，方法要对头，不怕困难，坚持到底。象大寨妇代会主任宋立英同志，大庆家属标兵薛桂芳同志，商业战线上的李素文同志等，就是我们的好榜样。她们生产很忙，工作很忙，文化又低，但她们为革命而学，有高度的自觉性，带着浓厚的阶级感情学习，勤学、苦学，把什么困难都挤跑了。她们在学习中，时时对照自己思想，找差距，找原因，勇于自我批评，虚心听取群众意见，虚心学习别人的先进经验，不断兴无灭资，不断破旧立新，不断联系实际，把工作、生产搞好。因此，她们进步很快。宋立英同志深有体会地说：“学习毛主席著作，就是要把自己脑子里的‘我’字去掉，把‘私’字从根子上挖掉，坚定地走社会主义、共产主义的道路”。
    宋立英同志说得很好，我们广大妇女群众学习毛主席著作，要用毛泽东思想进一步解决革命的方向和道路问题；树立建设社会主义和共产主义的远大理想，树立为革命而劳动的思想；要用革命的精神战胜各种困难；要有革命的思想方法和工作方法。这样我们就能从根本上提高觉悟，解决革命的世界观问题。
    趁这个机会，我向各级妇联同志讲几句话。
    我们各级妇联要在党的领导下，把妇女工作推进到一个新的水平，最根本的是要突出政治。要组织妇女群众学习毛主席著作，各级妇联干部首先要学习。学习不仅是为了教育群众，首先要改造自己的思想。要树立牢固的无产阶级世界观，全心全意为人民服务。我们新干部要解决革命的世界观问题，老干部也要继续解决这个根本问题。
    妇联干部要努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，就必须经常学、反复学，形成制度。要把学习和工作紧紧地结合起来。我们说，在妇联的工作会议上，“议大事，管本行”，首先就是要议各级妇联干部活学活用毛主席著作的大事，报告自己学习毛主席著作的体会，交流和总结经验，互相启发，互相帮助。要象大庆人那样做到“五结合”，这就是：学习毛主席著作和学习党的方针政策相结合；学习毛主席著作和学习解放军的经验相结合；学习毛主席著作和分析本单位的形势和任务相结合；学习毛主席著作和批评自我批评、改造思想相结合；学习毛主席著作和总结工作经验相结合。还要把学习焦裕禄同志作为学习毛主席著作的一个组成部分，要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，用彻底革命精神，来改造思想，改进工作，改进作风。
    妇联干部还要象毛主席经常教导的那样，面向基层，深入群众，坚持蹲点，总结经验，指导全面。在当前主要的是要坚持参加社会主义教育运动，在运动中坚持蹲点。在运动中坚持学习和领导群众自觉地学习毛主席著作。同时，管面上工作的同志，也要蹲点。在这些方面，领导干部要以身作则，带头示范，不要落在群众后面。要亲自总结典型经验，拿出一两个或几个本地的先进典型，来带动和指导面上的工作。必须懂得，典型是最有力的活样板，是从群众中来到群众中去，是一般号召和个别指导相结合的最有效的办法。
    亲爱的姐妹们！同志们！今年是我国第三个五年计划的第一年，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的运动，积极投入三大革命运动，积极参加比学赶帮超运动。毛主席早已指出：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗”。我们要充分发挥广大妇女的巨大作用，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮中，作出更大的贡献。让我们在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在革命化的道路上，奋勇前进！
