    “The Masses are the Real Heroes”
    Yi Hewan
    The Party Branch Secretary of the 601 Workshop of the Nanning Chemical Plant took us on a tour of their workshop. He pointed proudly at the machines one by one and said, "These were all installed by ourselves." Originally, the task of installing the machines was given to the machine repair workshop. The machine repair workshop had too many capital construction projects and insufficient technical strength, so the installation work was forced to be postponed. What to do? Wait, or do it yourself? The 601 Workshop decided to do it themselves and took over the task. "Is this going to work?" People started to discuss, with many holding skeptical attitudes.
    "Who says chicken feathers can't fly to the sky!" The comrades of the 601 Workshop overcame various difficulties and completed the installation task in just over forty days.
    Now the whole country is learning from Daqing. Some people only talk about learning from Daqing, but retreat when they encounter difficulties. Some people "learn from Daqing and look at actions." They establish lofty ambitions, set high aspirations, act as pioneers, and take the lead, truly promoting the Daqing spirit of "striving for progress and self-reliance," and thus achieve outstanding results. The 601 Workshop is an example.
    To truly achieve "striving for progress and self-reliance" is not so easy. First, many difficulties will be encountered, such as technical difficulties, difficulties in manpower and materials, ideological resistance, etc. In the face of difficulties, whether there is confidence and whether one believes in the wisdom and strength of the masses is the key to the success or failure of the work. There is a folk song that says: "Difficulty is like a spring, see how strong you are; if you are strong, it is weak, if you are weak, it is strong." In the eyes of people with great ambitions, "difficulty is a common thing, there is no difficult word in the hero's heart." Although the difficulty is great, the strength of the people is even stronger. As long as we believe in the masses and rely on the masses, there is no problem that cannot be solved. They always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, advance in the face of difficulties, and conquer them. Chairman Mao said: "The people have unlimited creative power. They can organize themselves and march towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, march towards the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare undertakings for themselves." If we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will be invincible and insurmountable; if we violate Chairman Mao's instructions, we will be met with obstacles everywhere and achieve nothing. Is not the example of the 601 Workshop of the Nanning Chemical Plant installing machines a good proof? The achievements of the 601 Workshop lie not only in its economic value, but more importantly in its political significance, which embodies this truth: We should believe in and rely on the masses, the masses are the real heroes!

    “群众是真正的英雄”
    易和元
    南宁化工厂六○一车间支部书记带着我们参观他们的车间。他指着一台台的机器自豪地说：“这都是我们自己安装的”。原来安装机器的任务，是交给机修车间的，机修车间承担的基建项目多，技术力量不足，安装工作被迫推迟了。怎么办？是等还是自己动手？六○一车间决定自己动手，把任务接了过来。“这成么？”人们议论开了，许多人抱着怀疑的态度。
    “谁说鸡毛不能上天”！六○一车间的同志们克服种种困难，只用了四十多天的时间就完成安装任务。
    现在全国都在学大庆。有的人学大庆只是口头上说，遇着困难就打退堂鼓。有的人是“学大庆，看行动”，他们树雄心，立壮志，当闯将，打先锋，真正发扬“奋发图强，自力更生”的大庆精神，因而取得突出的成绩。六○一车间就是一个例子。
    要真正做到“奋发图强，自力更生”并不那么容易，这首先会遇到许多困难，例如技术的困难，人力物力的困难，思想的阻力，等等。在困难面前，有没有信心，相不相信群众的智慧和力量，这是工作成败的关键。有首民歌写道：“困难象弹簧，看你强不强；你强它就弱，你弱它就强。”在具有雄心壮志的人看来，“困难本是寻常事，英雄心中无难字”，困难虽大，但人的力量更强，只要相信群众，依靠群众，没有解决不了的难题。他们时刻记着毛主席的教导，迎着困难前进，战而胜之。毛主席说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业”。照着毛主席的指示去办，就能无坚不摧，无攻不克；违反毛主席的指示，就将处处碰壁，一事无成。南宁化工厂六○一车间安装机器的事例，不就是一个很好的证明吗？六○一车间所取得的成绩，不仅在于它的经济价值，而更重要的在于它的政治意义，它体现了这样一条真理：应当相信和依靠群众，群众是真正的英雄！
