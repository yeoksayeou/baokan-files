    Nanjing Soil Instrument Factory is producing soil instruments in batches for various regions.
    Soil instruments are important equipment needed for scientific research, soil improvement, water conservancy construction, engineering construction, and geological exploration. The Nanjing Soil Instrument Factory currently provides more than forty types of soil instruments to various departments. The temperature, humidity, hardness, viscosity, water infiltration capacity, water saturation capacity, and bearing capacity of soil can all be reliably measured using these instruments.
    Not long ago, this factory successfully trial-produced a new type of soil hardness meter, which is simple in structure, small in size, and weighs only 6.3 kilograms. This instrument can automatically record and is suitable for multi-point measurement. When using it, by shaking the handle in the middle of the instrument, the metal cone inside the instrument cylinder drills into the soil for 200 millimeters. At this time, the soil hardness data is automatically recorded on the recording paper. This instrument can record the soil hardness coefficient at eighty points with one change of recording paper.
    The Nanjing Soil Instrument Factory is a small factory with only more than two hundred people, weak technical strength, and relatively poor equipment. Initially, the workers only produced some simple and crude soil drilling tools. In the past two years, the user units have demanded more and more varieties and quantities of soil instruments. In this situation, they earnestly learned from the user units and adopted a three-way combination method of combining with user units and scientific research departments to overcome the difficulties in product design and technology. Therefore, most of the soil instruments meet the requirements of the user units.
    This factory has also reformed some old products. The soil shear meter they produced in the past weighed 150 kilograms. Now, the newly trial-produced portable shear meter weighs only 20 kilograms, making it easy to carry and use, and the measurement accuracy is also high.

    南京为各地增产土壤仪器
    这是进行科学研究和农田水利建设等的重要设备
    南京土壤仪器厂正在为各地成批生产土壤仪器。
    土壤仪器是进行科学研究和土壤改良、水利建设、工程建筑、地质勘探所需要的重要设备。南京土壤仪器厂目前提供给各部门的土壤仪器达四十多种，土壤的温度、湿度、硬度、粘度、渗水能力、饱水能力、承载能力等，都可以采用这些仪器取得可靠的数据。
    不久前这个工厂试制成功的新型土壤硬度仪，结构简单，体积小，全部重量只有六点三公斤。这种仪器能够自动记录，适于多点测量。使用时，摇动仪器中部的手柄，仪器筒内的金属锥头就钻入土里二百毫米。这时，土壤硬度的数据便自动记录在记录纸上。这种仪器换一次记录纸可以记录八十个点上的土壤硬度系数。
    南京土壤仪器厂是一个只有二百多人的小厂，技术力量薄弱，设备也比较差。开始，职工们只生产一些简单粗糙的土壤钻具。近两年来，使用单位对土壤仪器的品种、数量要求越来越多。在这种情况下，他们认真向使用单位学习，采用跟使用单位、科学研究部门三结合的办法，克服了产品设计和技术上的困难，因而绝大部分土壤仪器都满足了使用单位的要求。
    这个厂还对部分老产品进行了改革。过去他们生产的土壤剪力仪，重一百五十公斤。现在他们试制成功的新型轻便剪力仪只有二十公斤重，便于携带和使用，测量精度也高。
