    Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here solemnly to commemorate the sixteenth anniversary of the "March 19th" National Anti-U.S. Struggle Day in Vietnam and to hold the "Week of Support for the Vietnamese People." Sixteen years ago, half a million students and people in Saigon organized a massive protest demonstration to drive away invading American warships, igniting the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. Since then, the Vietnamese people have held high the banner of opposition to U.S. imperialism, and have carried out heroic struggles, advancing wave upon wave, to achieve the unification and complete liberation of their motherland, achieving one glorious victory after another. The Vietnamese people's struggle has been supported by the people of all countries in the world. The Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference held in January this year decided that March 12-19 this year would be "Week of Support for the Vietnamese People." The Chinese people reiterate here that they resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and express their highest respect to the heroic Vietnamese people.

    In the past sixteen years, the situation in Vietnam has undergone earth-shaking changes. The great Vietnamese people have been tempered into an invincible force in the battle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism. The military and civilians in South Vietnam, unafraid of violence and sacrifice, have severely attacked the American aggressors, having annihilated more than 600,000 American and puppet troops, and liberated four-fifths of the land and more than ten million people. In the first two months of this year, under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the military and civilians in South Vietnam advanced victoriously, again crushing one so-called "offensive" after another launched madly by the American bandits, eliminating more than 30,000 enemy troops, and destroying more than 500 American aircraft, beating the American elite troops to the point of losing their armor and fleeing in dismay. The military and civilians in North Vietnam, in the battle to severely punish the American aerial bandits, have achieved the brilliant result of shooting down more than 900 enemy aircraft. The Chinese people warmly hail the great victory of the Vietnamese people and extend our warmest congratulations to them.

    The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has enhanced the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and deflated the arrogance of imperialism, setting a brilliant example for all oppressed nations and oppressed people of daring to struggle and daring to win. With a high degree of revolutionary spirit and infinite wisdom, the Vietnamese people have brilliantly applied the strategy and tactics of people's war, developing people's war to a new peak. They are fighting on the front line of the anti-U.S. struggle, holding back more than 200,000 American aggressor troops, disrupting the counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment of U.S. imperialism, which is the greatest support for the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the greatest contribution to the cause of world peace. The victory of the Vietnamese people once again vividly proves that the extremely ferocious U.S. imperialism is actually nothing more than a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. The American aggressors have no just cause, have lost all popular support, and their troops are most afraid of hardship and death. It is entirely possible to defeat them by using the magic weapon of people's war. The victory of the Vietnamese people also powerfully proves that the "native" weapons of the people can defeat the "foreign" weapons of the reactionary forces, and that the revolutionary human advantage will ultimately overwhelm the reactionary forces' weapons advantage. This is the law of all revolutionary wars in history.

    U.S. imperialism is the most savage, most brutal, and most shameless aggressor in human history, and has always played the counter-revolutionary dual tactics of military suppression and political deception. U.S. imperialism has launched a heinous war of aggression against Vietnam, implementing a "scorched earth" plan and a "three alls" policy on Vietnamese soil, and even openly using poison gas and chemical poisons on a large scale, committing monstrous crimes.

    When it was battered and bruised, it played "unconditional discussions" and "fourteen points" proposals and other "peace talks" frauds, launching a so-called "peace offensive" to cover up its conspiracy to expand the war. Washington even released the news that it was prepared to let the South Vietnam National Liberation Front participate in "peace talks," "elections," and the establishment of a "coalition government" as an "independent group." Who can be deceived by this kind of robber logic that treats itself as an emperor, except for the accomplices of the robbers or those who have been frightened by the robbers and can only echo them? Hasn't the robber already exposed his own deception? The "suspension of bombing" from the end of last December to the resumption of bombing of North Vietnam in early February this year completely exposed the face of the Johnson administration as a great deceiver and great executioner. The situation after the Honolulu Conference in February further showed that U.S. imperialism is determined to expand the war and stay in South Vietnam. The number of U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam has reached more than 200,000, and it is still continuing to increase its troops and is scouring more cannon fodder from its vassal states such as South Korea and Australia. U.S. imperialism is accelerating the construction of various military facilities in Thailand, using the traitorous dictatorial government of Thailand as its tool of aggression. U.S. imperialism and its vassals are also stepping up military aggression against Laos and carrying out armed provocations against Cambodia, deliberately trying to expand the flames of war to the entire Indochina and pointing the spearhead at China.

    The Vietnamese people cannot be intimidated or deceived. President Ho Chi Minh has already solemnly announced to the world: "The Vietnamese people will never submit to the threats of U.S. imperialism at any time"; "As long as there is one American aggressor soldier on our land, our people will resolutely fight against them." The people of the entire Indochina cannot be intimidated or deceived. Recently, Prince Souphanouvong called on the Lao people to fight resolutely until the American aggressors are completely defeated and the entire motherland is liberated. Prince Sihanouk has also repeatedly reiterated that the Cambodian people are not afraid of the threats of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and will spare no sacrifice to defend their sovereignty and independence. The Vietnamese people and the people of the entire Indochina share the same hatred and support each other, and will surely give the American aggressors increasingly heavy blows.

    China and Vietnam are brotherly neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth, and are close comrades-in-arms who share life and death. The Chinese people have always regarded the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and their victory as a great support to themselves, and regard giving full support to the fraternal Vietnamese people as their bounden internationalist duty. The Chinese people are unswervingly with the Vietnamese people, with the people of Indochina and Asia, and will fight together to completely defeat the American aggressors. U.S. imperialism, listen: 650 million Chinese people are ready. If you insist on coming to compete with us again, then please do so. Come anytime, come alone or come in groups. We will not refuse anyone, and we will eliminate as many as come. For the great cause of world peace and human liberation, the Chinese people will never spare all necessary sacrifices and will fight together with the people of all countries to make their own contribution to the final burial of U.S. imperialism, the chief culprit of contemporary aggression and war.

    The Vietnamese people's struggle is like a mirror that reflects the true colors of many monsters and demons in the world. The British Wilson government, on the one hand, supports the American war of aggression against Vietnam, and on the other hand, actively acts as a political broker peddling the American "peace talks" fraud, advocating war blackmail for U.S. imperialism. As an American vassal, the Japanese Sato government is unwilling to lag behind and is also working to promote the American "peace talks" fraud, and is actively supporting U.S. imperialism in expanding its war of aggression in Asia, attempting to fish in troubled waters and make a fortune from the war.

    In the face of this mirror of the Vietnamese people's struggle, the traitorous face of the modern revisionists is becoming increasingly clear. The modern revisionists are clamoring for "united action" on the Vietnam issue, but in reality, they are colluding with U.S. imperialism, attempting to use the Vietnam issue to conduct dirty political deals with the United States and engage in united anti-China articles. If they had not reached a tacit understanding with the United States, how would the United States dare to draw troops from Europe to Vietnam to expand its war of aggression? With whom are they carrying out "united action"? Isn't this obvious?

    The matter is very clear

    越南人民战争完全可以打败美帝国主义
    中国人民决心不惜牺牲同各国人民一起为埋葬美帝而奋斗
    郭沫若同志在首都各界纪念越南全国反美斗争日和“声援越南人民周”大会上的讲话
    今天我们首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，纪念“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十六周年和举行“声援越南人民周”。十六年前，西贡五十万学生和人民，为了赶走入侵的美国军舰，组织了声势浩大的抗议示威，点起了越南人民反美爱国斗争的火焰。从那时起，越南人民高举反对美帝国主义的旗帜，为争取祖国的统一和完全解放，进行了前赴后继的英勇斗争，取得了一个又一个的光辉胜利。越南人民的斗争得到了世界各国人民的支持。今年一月举行的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议决定，今年三月十二至十九日为“声援越南人民周”。中国人民在这里重申，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，并向英雄的越南人民表示崇高的敬意。
    十六年来，越南的形势发生了翻天覆地的变化。伟大的越南人民在抗击美帝国主义侵略的战斗中，已经锻炼成为一支不可战胜的力量。越南南方军民不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，狠狠打击美国侵略者，已经歼灭了六十多万美伪军，解放了五分之四的土地和一千万以上的人口。今年头两个月，越南南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，乘胜前进，又粉碎了美国强盗疯狂发动的一个接一个的所谓“攻势”，消灭了敌军三万多人，击毁美机五百多架，把美国王牌军打得丢盔弃甲、狼狈不堪。越南北方军民在严惩美国空中强盗的战斗中，取得了击落敌机九百多架的辉煌战果。中国人民热情欢呼越南人民的伟大胜利，并向他们表示最热烈的祝贺。
    越南人民的英勇斗争，长了世界革命人民的志气，灭了帝国主义的威风，为一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的光辉榜样。越南人民以高度的革命精神和无穷的智慧，出色地运用了人民战争的战略战术，把人民战争发展到新的高峰。他们战斗在反美斗争的最前线，拖住了美国二十多万侵略军，打乱了美帝国主义反革命的全球战略部署，这是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动最大的支援，对世界和平事业最大的贡献。越南人民的胜利再一次生动地证明，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义实际上不过是外强中干的纸老虎。美国侵略者师出无名，失道寡助，它的军队最怕苦、最怕死，用人民战争的法宝，是完全可以把它打败的。越南人民的胜利也有力地证明，人民的“土”武器可以战胜反动势力的“洋”武器，革命的人的优势终究会压倒反动势力武器的优势，这是历史上一切革命战争的规律。
    美帝国主义是人类历史上最野蛮、最残暴、最无耻的侵略者，一贯玩弄军事镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手。美帝国主义穷凶极恶地发动对越南的侵略战争，在越南的土地上推行“焦土”计划和“三光”政策，甚至公然大规模使用毒气和化学毒药，犯下了滔天的罪行。
    当它碰得头破血流之后，又玩弄“无条件讨论”和“十四点”主张之类的“和谈”骗局，发动所谓“和平攻势”，来掩盖扩大战争的阴谋。华盛顿甚至放出空气，说什么准备让越南南方民族解放阵线作为一个“独立集团”参加“和谈”、“选举”和成立“联合政府”。这种以太上皇自居的强盗逻辑，除了强盗的帮凶，或者被强盗吓倒了的人，才能随声附和之外，它到底骗得了谁呢？强盗自己不是已经把自己的骗局揭穿了吗？从去年十二月底开始“暂停轰炸”到今年二月初恢复对越南北方的轰炸，彻底暴露了约翰逊政府那副大骗子手、大刽子手的面目。二月间檀香山会议后的情况进一步表明，美帝国主义是决心要扩大战争、赖在南越不走。美帝国主义在南越的侵略军已达到二十多万人，目前还在继续增兵，并且向南朝鲜、澳大利亚等仆从国家搜罗更多的炮灰。美帝国主义在泰国加速修建各种军事设施，利用泰国卖国独裁政府作它的侵略工具。美帝国主义及其仆从还加紧对老挝发动军事侵略，对柬埔寨进行武装挑衅，蓄意要把战火扩大到整个印度支那，并且把矛头针对中国。
    越南人民是吓不倒和骗不了的。胡志明主席早已经向全世界庄严宣布：“越南人民任何时候都绝不向美帝国主义的威胁屈服”；“只要我们的国土上还有美国侵略军，我国人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗”。整个印度支那人民都是吓不倒和骗不了的。最近，苏发努冯亲王号召老挝人民坚决战斗，直到彻底挫败美国侵略者，解放整个祖国。西哈努克亲王也多次重申，柬埔寨人民不怕美帝国主义及其走狗的威胁，将不惜牺牲保卫主权和独立。越南人民和整个印度支那人民同仇敌忾，互相支持，定将给予美国侵略者以越来越沉重的打击。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦，是生死与共的亲密战友。中国人民一向把越南人民的抗美救国斗争和胜利看作对自己的极大支持，把全力支援兄弟的越南人民看作是自己应尽的国际主义义务。中国人民坚定不移地与越南人民在一起，与印度支那和亚洲人民在一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者而共同奋斗。美帝国主义听着：六亿五千万中国人民已经准备好了。如果你们硬要来同我们再次较量，那就请便吧。什么时候来都行，单独来或结伙来都行。来者不拒，来多少，消灭多少。为了世界和平和人类解放的伟大事业，中国人民决不吝惜一切必要的牺牲，同各国人民一起战斗，为最后埋葬美帝国主义这个当代侵略和战争的祸首作出自己的贡献。
    越南人民的斗争就象一面照妖镜，照清了世界上许多牛鬼蛇神的原形。英国威尔逊政府，一面支持美国对越南的侵略战争，一面积极充当兜售美国“和谈”骗局的政治掮客，为美帝国主义的战争讹诈张目。作为美国仆从的日本佐藤政府，不甘心落后，也在为推销美国的“和谈”骗局奔走效劳，并且积极支持美帝国主义在亚洲扩大侵略战争，妄图混水摸鱼，发战争财。
    在越南人民斗争的这面照妖镜面前，现代修正主义者的叛徒面目暴露得越来越清楚了。现代修正主义者，大叫大嚷在越南问题上采取“联合行动”，而实际上却同美帝国主义里应外合，企图利用越南问题同美国进行肮脏的政治交易，大作联合反华的文章。如果他们没有同美国达成默契，试问，美国怎么敢从欧洲抽调兵力到越南去扩大侵略战争呢？他们究竟是在同谁搞“联合行动”，这难道还不明显吗？
    事情非常清楚，越南问题只有按照越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明才能解决。这就是说，美国必须停止对整个越南的侵略，从越南南方全部撤出美国及其仆从国家的军队，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方唯一的真正代表，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。我们深信，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到哪一级，不管越南人民的斗争还会遇到什么样的困难和曲折，英勇顽强的越南人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的正确领导下，一定能取得抗美救国伟大事业的最后胜利。
    同志们，朋友们，目前全世界的革命势力同反革命势力之间，特别是以亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗之间，正进行着一场剧烈的搏斗。
    以美国为首的世界反动势力决不甘心走向灭亡。它们正在变本加厉地推行战争政策和侵略政策，残暴镇压各国人民的革命斗争，甚至对已经取得独立的一些国家，疯狂反扑，进行颠覆，力图恢复它们的罪恶统治。但是，以美国为首的反动势力的垂死挣扎是挽救不了它们的灭亡的，相反地，这只会帮助人民擦亮眼睛，提高觉悟，进一步把人民动员起来，把反帝革命斗争推向新的高潮。美国侵略越南的战争越是升级，各国人民的反美斗争也随着升级。美帝国主义正驱使全世界人民，包括美国人民在内，更加坚决地走上消灭美帝国主义的伟大斗争的道路。一个更大、更剧烈的反美风暴不久即将来临。
    毛主席告诉我们：在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，但是决挽救不了它的灭亡。
    我们相信，不管世界人民的革命运动还将经历多少曲折，前途是无限光明的。只要各国人民团结起来，提高警惕，坚持斗争，向人类的共同敌人——美帝国主义勇敢进军，就一定能够排除万难，达到最后胜利的目的。
    美帝必败！越南人民必胜！世界人民必胜！
    美帝国主义从越南滚出去！从印度支那滚出去！从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲滚出去！从它所侵占的一切地方滚出去！
