    Look at the Ugly Face of the Mastermind Behind the Ghanaian Reactionary Coup!
    Washington Gleefully Announces Recognition of the Ghanaian Coup Authorities
    American Newspapers Admit Washington's Involvement in the Ghanaian Coup
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 5th: The American authorities have expressed jubilation over the military coup in Ghana and have quickly recognized the Ghanaian military regime.
    State Department spokesman McCloskey said in a statement on the evening of the 4th that Wayne Fredericks, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, summoned Boafou, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Ghanaian Embassy, on the 4th and gave him a "response to a routine diplomatic note," "thereby constituting the United States' recognition of the government of the National Liberation Council of Ghana."
    McCloskey also said that the State Department stated in its reply that it hoped to maintain "friendly and mutually beneficial relations" between the US government and the Ghanaian "government."
    Before the United States announced its recognition of the Ghanaian coup authorities, the official United States Information Service praised the coup authorities' remarks as "encouraging" on the 2nd. At the same time, the Associated Press quoted Washington officials on the 3rd as saying that if the Ghanaian "new regime" requests the provision of technicians and teachers, "the United States government will consider such a request. At the same time, it has been indicated that the appropriate US government agencies are preparing to receive such requests. It seems very clear that Ghana will request large-scale economic assistance."
    As early as the same day that the military coup occurred in Ghana (February 24), William, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, revealed the eagerness of the Washington authorities to recognize the coup authorities. He said that the United States can maintain "good and beneficial" relations with the Ghanaian military.
    The US State Department tried its best to cover up the relationship between the United States and the Ghanaian military coup. On the second day of the coup, McCloskey hurriedly declared that the Washington authorities had no "involvement" in the coup. However, an article published in the Christian Science Monitor on February 28 quoted "London sources" as pointing out: "Washington may be involved in the anti-Nkrumah coup."
    An article in the New York Herald Tribune on February 25, entitled "No Tears for Nkrumah," stated: "Government officials yesterday openly rejoiced at the overthrow of Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah." It quoted a State Department official as saying that "no one here is unhappy" about the coup.
    An article published in the Wall Street Journal on February 25 attacked Nkrumah for making Ghana's relations with the West "as bad as they could be." It specifically pointed out: "His latest book—'Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism'—attacked (the United States), which made the United States very annoyed, so the Johnson administration recently rejected Ghana's request for $100 million in food aid over the next seven years."
    The newspaper also criticized the Nkrumah government for severing diplomatic relations with Britain because of Britain's attitude toward the Southern Rhodesia issue.
    The March 7 issue of U.S. News & World Report, published in advance, bluntly stated: "Washington is not shedding tears for Nkrumah; his anti-American attitude has been venomous in recent months."

    请看加纳反动政变幕后策划者的嘴脸！
    华盛顿兴高采烈宣布承认加纳政变当局
    美报供认华盛顿同加纳政变有牵连
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当局对加纳军事政变表示兴高采烈，并且很快就承认了加纳军事政权。
    美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基四日晚上发表声明说，美国负责非洲事务的代理助理国务卿魏恩·弗雷德里克斯四日召见了加纳大使馆代办博阿福，把美国“对一份例行外交照会的一份复照”交给他，“从而构成了美国对加纳全国解放委员会政府的承认”。
    麦克洛斯基还说，美国国务院在复照中表示希望美国政府和加纳“政府”之间保持“友好和互利关系”。
    在美国宣布承认加纳政变当局之前，官方的美国新闻处在二日赞扬政变当局的言论“令人鼓舞”。同时，美联社三日引用华盛顿官员们的话说，如果加纳“新政权”要求提供技术人员和教师，“美国政府将考虑这种要求。同时，已经表明，适当的美国政府机构正在准备接到这种要求。看来很清楚，加纳将要求大规模的经济援助”。
    早在加纳发生军事政变的同一天（二月二十四日），美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿威廉斯就流露了华盛顿当局在承认政变当局方面迫不及待的心情。他说，美国可以同加纳军方保持“良好和有利”的关系。
    美国国务院竭力掩盖美国同加纳军事政变的关系。在政变的第二天，麦克洛斯基就慌忙宣称，华盛顿当局同政变没有任何“牵连”。但是《基督教科学箴言报》二月二十八日刊登的一篇报道引用“伦敦的消息”指出：“华盛顿可能同反恩克鲁玛政变有牵连。”
    《纽约先驱论坛报》二月二十五日题为《不为恩克鲁玛流泪》的一篇文章说：“（美国）政府官员昨天公开为推翻加纳总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛的政变感到高兴。”它引用美国国务院一个官员的话说，对这次政变“这里当然不会不高兴”。
    《华尔街日报》二月二十五日刊登的一篇文章，攻击恩克鲁玛使加纳同西方的关系“坏到不能再坏”。它特别指出：“他最新的书——《新殖民主义——帝国主义的最后阶段》——（对美国）进行了攻击，这使美国十分恼火，以致约翰逊政府在最近拒绝了加纳提出的关于在未来七年内给予一亿美元粮食援助的要求。”
    这家报纸还抨击恩克鲁玛政府因为英国对南罗得西亚问题的态度而断绝了同英国的外交关系。
    提前出版的三月七日一期《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志露骨地说：“华盛顿并不为恩克鲁玛掉泪，他的反美态度在最近几个月中已经带有刻毒的味道。”
