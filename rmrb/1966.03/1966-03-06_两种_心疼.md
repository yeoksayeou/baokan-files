    Anyone who has visited the Yutian Grain Depot will be enlightened by a blackboard standing in the yard. What enlightens people is not only the article on the blackboard about overcoming arrogance and complacency, but more importantly, the origin of this blackboard. It turns out that this is not an ordinary blackboard, but one made by the staff using sorghum stalks hammered into thin sheets, coated with mud ash and chimney soot. Someone asked:
  “Why don’t you buy one?” The owner replied: “The comrades feel distressed at the thought of spending the country’s money, who would be willing to buy one!”
    Feeling distressed at the thought of spending the country's money! This is the ideological driving force behind the Yutian Grain Depot staff's efforts to practice thrift in every possible way. Contrary to the situation here, there are some comrades in some enterprises who don't feel any pain when spending more of the country's money, but feel terribly pained when spending a dime of their own; they don't care about wasting the country's things, but are extremely sad when their own things are damaged. These two kinds of "feeling the pain" reflect two different ideologies and two different worldviews.

    两种“心疼”
    凡是到玉田粮库参观过的人，都会从立在院子里的一块黑板上受到一些启示。给人启示的，还不仅仅是写在上面的戒骄戒躁的文章，更重要的是这块黑板的来历。原来这不是一块普通的黑板，而是职工们用秫楷打成箔，涂上泥灰、黑烟子做成的。有人问：
  “你们为啥不买一块？”主人回答说：“同志们一听说花国家的钱就心疼，谁舍得买呢！”
    一听说花国家的钱就心疼！这是玉田粮库职工千方百计厉行节约的思想动力。跟这里的情况相反，有的企业里有这样一些同志：多花国家多少钱也不心疼，多花自己一毛钱就心疼得要命；糟踏国家的东西毫不在意，自己的一点东西损坏了就难过得要死。这两种“心疼”，反映着两种不同的思想，反映着两种不同的世界观。
