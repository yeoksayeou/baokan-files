    Talking about "Struggle"
    Liu Shuchen, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army
    Studying Chairman Mao's writings, more and more people are talking about "struggle." For example: struggling with the "self" in thought, struggling with the "difficulty" in work, struggling with "laziness" in style, struggling with "complacency" in ideological cultivation, struggling with "change" in life, and so on. The word "struggle" has become closely linked with studying Chairman Mao's writings and transforming thought.

    This is a great thing, and the inevitable result of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings and making great efforts in the "application" aspect. Because "struggle" is struggle, it is battle, it is revolution. The discussion of "struggle" indicates that many comrades have grasped the essence and core of studying Chairman Mao's writings. A bell won't ring if it's not struck, a table won't move if it's not carried, the ground won't be clean if it's not swept. To transform thought and promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, problems cannot be solved without struggle. In this sense, studying Chairman Mao's writings, "struggle" is application, daring to struggle is daring to apply, knowing how to struggle is knowing how to apply, struggling fiercely is applying fiercely, and consciously struggling is consciously applying.

    From contact with some comrades, I have found three different views on "struggle." The first believes that struggle is a "painful" process. The second believes that struggle is a "pleasant" process. That is, in the first stage of the struggle, the spirit is painful; but when the problem is solved, the shortcomings are overcome, and the mistakes are corrected, then there is unspeakable joy. They call this "bitter first, then sweet." The third believes that struggle is infinitely joyful.

    These three statements, in my opinion, the second is a step forward than the first, and the third is a step forward than the second. Understanding ideological transformation as a painful process makes sense. Ideological transformation is a matter of rebirth, and there is indeed pain in the process of transformation. However, as long as you pass the "pain" barrier, what comes next is "joy." In the process of transforming the subjective world, revolutionaries lose only spiritual shackles, but gain a new spiritual world. In this sense, it is "infinitely joyful"!

    To be a true communist, one must constantly struggle with the "self." Make one's life a life of struggle against the enemy, and at the same time a life of struggle with the "self." The so-called "self" is bourgeois individualism. For it, we must eradicate it from the roots and completely defeat it!

### 谈“斗”

    谈“斗”
    解放军某部　刘书忱
    学习毛主席著作，谈“斗”的人越来越多了。诸如：在思想上和“我”字斗，在工作上和“难”字斗，在作风上和“懒”字斗，在意识修养上和“满”字斗，在生活上和“变”字斗，等等。这个“斗”字，和学习毛主席著作、和改造思想，已经紧密地联系在一起了。
    这是一件大好事，是活学活用毛主席著作、在“用”字上狠下功夫的必然结果。因为“斗”就是斗争，就是战斗，就是革命。大谈“斗”的情况说明，许多同志学习毛主席著作，已经抓住了本质，抓住了核心。钟不敲不响，桌子不搬不走，地不扫不净。要改造思想，要兴无灭资，不经过斗争是不能解决问题的。从这个意义上说，学习毛主席著作，“斗”就是用，敢斗就是敢用，会斗就是会用，狠斗就是狠用，自觉地斗就是自觉地用。
    从和一些同志接触中，发现对“斗”有三种不同看法。第一种认为：斗是一个“痛苦”的过程。第二种认为：斗是一个“痛快”的过程。即在斗的前一段，精神上是痛苦的；但把问题解决了，缺点克服了，错误改正了，那时就有说不出的快乐。他们称这叫“先痛而后快”。第三种认为：斗，其乐无穷。
    这三种说法，我以为，第二种比第一种进了一步，第三种又比第二种进了一步。把思想改造理解为痛苦的过程，这是有道理的。思想改造是脱胎换骨的事情，在改造的过程中确实是有痛苦的。但是，只要通过“痛”这一关，后面来的就是“快”。革命者在改造主观世界的过程中，失去的仅仅是精神上的锁链，得到的却是一个新的精神世界。就这一点来说，则是“其乐无穷”了！
    要作一个真正的共产主义者，就要不断和“我”斗争。使自己的一生成为与敌斗争的一生，同时又是与“我”斗争的一生。所谓“我”，就是资产阶级个人主义。对于它，必须从根拔除，彻底打垮！
