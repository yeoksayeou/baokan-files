    The February Battlefield Situation in South Vietnam Shows that U.S. Imperialism Can Be Defeated
    People's Guerrilla Warfare Puts the Enemy in a Situation of Being Divided and Attacked
    Liberation Army Annihilates Two U.S. Battalions in the Ya Duo and Peng Zhuang Areas in One Fell Swoop
    People's Armed Forces in Bien Hoa and Other Provinces Kill and Wound More Than 200 U.S. Soldiers in Several Battles
    Editor's Note: Over the past month, the U.S. aggressors have launched several "offensives" in South Vietnam with great fanfare, but each one has suffered a disastrous defeat. The recent large-scale "mopping-up" operation conducted by the U.S. aggressor troops in Tu Duong province was similarly crushed by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.

    In these "offensives," the U.S. aggressors concentrated a large number of troops equipped with various modern weapons. They thought that this would avoid being swallowed up by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army as in the past, and even vainly attempted to swallow up the main force of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. However, the facts are completely contrary to their wishes. The U.S. aggressor troops either found nothing or were severely beaten by the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, suffering heavy losses. This shows that despite the massive increase in troops and frantic struggles, U.S. imperialism cannot cope with people's war. As long as the patriotic soldiers and civilians of South Vietnam rely on the magic weapon of people's war and highly utilize the strategies and tactics of people's war, they will be able to defeat all enemy offensives and achieve brilliant victories.

    Do you concentrate your forces to attack? My method is: fight if I can win, and retreat if I can't. If it's advantageous for you here, I retreat; if it's advantageous for me there, I grab you and beat you hard. If I can fight guerrilla warfare, I fight guerrilla warfare; if I can fight mobile warfare, I fight mobile warfare. You can concentrate superior forces in the overall situation and carry out strategic flanking and encirclement against me, conducting large-scale encirclements and "mopping-up" operations; I can use flanking and encirclement tactics in campaigns and battles to turn your large-scale encirclements and "mopping-up" operations into small-scale encirclements and "mopping-up" operations against you; I will annihilate a company if I can annihilate a company, and I will annihilate a battalion if I can annihilate a battalion. In this way, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces will still be able to maintain the initiative on the battlefield and beat the U.S. aggressor troops to a pulp. Therefore, it is clear that no matter how many troops U.S. imperialism brings in or what kind of "offensive" it launches, it cannot change its passive and beaten situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield or reverse its defeat.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st. March—The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published a commentary on the 28th of February on the February war situation in South Vietnam, pointing out: "February of this year was a month of brilliant victories for the military and civilians of South Vietnam, and also a month of disastrous defeats for the aggressors and the traitorous clique."

    The commentary, entitled "A Month of Great Victories for Guerrilla Warfare," said that the most prominent feature of the South Vietnamese battlefield in February was the vigorous and widespread development of the guerrilla warfare movement. Local troops and guerrillas played an important role in defeating the enemy's "mopping-up" operations and annihilating the enemy’s U.S.-puppet troops.

    The commentary said that the U.S. aggressors have tried their best to concentrate their forces to launch large-scale "mopping-up" operations into the liberated areas, vainly attempting to expand the "security scope" for their military bases established in the central coastal areas, the Central Highlands, the southeastern region of the south, and Saigon, which are currently under serious threat from the liberation armed forces, and vainly attempting to put the Liberation Army in a passive situation. The commentary pointed out: "However, the U.S. aggressors not only failed to gain the initiative in the conspiracy to attack the liberation armed forces, but on the contrary, were passively trapped in the layers of encirclement of people's war."

    The commentary said that in just a few major battles, the guerrillas annihilated more than 6,000 U.S., puppet, and accomplice troops, and shot down and destroyed nearly 200 enemy planes. The enemy was in a situation of being divided and attacked everywhere.

    The commentary said that because the enemy concentrated its forces to carry out large-scale "mopping-up" operations, the areas they temporarily controlled became empty, creating favorable conditions for guerrilla activities. In addition to attacking and ambushing the enemy, local troops and guerrillas also deeply penetrated the enemy's heart, directly launching surprise attacks on the enemy's main strongholds, causing the enemy to panic and be in a state of utter disarray.

    The commentary said that it is obvious that the local troops and guerrillas in South Vietnam not only have sufficient ability to thwart the enemy's large and small-scale "mopping-up" operations, but also actively attack the enemy and destroy a series of enemy strongholds. They fight the enemy during the enemy's "mopping-up" operations, and at the same time, they fight the enemy in the enemy's rear, disrupting all the enemy's counter-attack, nibbling, and "pacification" aggressive plans.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st. March—According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on February 24, the South Vietnam Liberation Army, in the anti-"mopping-up" battle in the Ya Duo and Peng Zhuang areas, about 11 kilometers northeast of Bien Cat City, Tu Duong Province, wiped out two battalions of the U.S. First Infantry Division and their headquarters in one fell swoop, and eliminated two armored vehicle teams equipped with 48 battle vehicles (including 30 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles). In addition, it severely damaged a battalion of Australian accomplice troops.

    This is another heavy blow to the U.S. First Infantry Division by the Liberation Army after the battles of Bao Bang, Gan Che, and You Ding.

    In this battle, the Liberation Army units fought very beautifully. With a high degree of hatred for the American invading bandits, they quickly crossed forests and streams and surrounded the enemy in the Ya Duo area. At dawn on the 24th, the Liberation Army units launched a fierce attack on the enemy simultaneously, first eliminating the enemy's headquarters, causing the enemy to lose command and panic. Then, after four hours of fierce fighting, the Liberation Army completely controlled the entire battlefield and wiped out the enemy completely.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st. March—According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Army and guerrillas in Gia Dinh and Bien Hoa provinces in South Vietnam killed and wounded more than 240 U.S. aggressor troops in recent battles.

    The guerrillas in Gu Chi County, Gia Dinh Province, annihilated another 115 U.S. aggressor troops in two days of fighting on February 14 and 18.

    On the 14th, two companies of the U.S. military conducted a "mopping-up" operation in Zhuang Lan Village, Xin An Hui Township. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the local guerrillas repelled the enemy's multiple attacks, annihilated 40 U.S. aggressor troops, and destroyed two M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and one jeep. On the same day, the guerrillas in De Xie Township also repelled an attack by a company of U.S. troops and took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing and wounding 35 enemy soldiers.

    On the 18th, the guerrillas in De Xie Township ambushed a company of U.S. troops on the highway and annihilated 40 enemy soldiers.

    On February 7, the Liberation Armed Forces of Bien Hoa Province, South Vietnam, in the battle to defend the Xin Qing Shan liberated area, dealt a heavy blow to the Second Brigade of the U.S. First Infantry Division, which went to "mop up", killing and wounding 127 enemy soldiers on the spot, shooting down three helicopters, and damaging one.

### 南越二月战局表明美帝国主义是可以打败的  人民游击战陷敌于被分割和挨打局面

    南越二月战局表明美帝国主义是可以打败的
    人民游击战陷敌于被分割和挨打局面
    解放军在芽多蓬庄地区一举歼灭美军两个营
    边和等省人民武装几次战斗毙伤美军二百多
    编者按：美国侵略者一个多月来在南越战场上气势汹汹地发动了几路“攻势”，都一个一个地先后遭到惨重的失败。最近美国侵略军在土龙木省进行的一次大规模“扫荡”，也同样的被南越人民武装力量所粉碎。
    美国侵略者在这些“攻势”中，都是集中了较大的兵力，配备了各种现代化武器。他们以为这样就能够避免象过去那样被南越解放军吃掉，而且还妄图吃掉南越解放军的主力。但是，事实却完全和他们的愿望相反，美国侵略军不是扑空，就是被南越解放武装力量狠揍，损失惨重。这表明了美帝国主义尽管大量增兵，疯狂挣扎，也无法对付人民战争。南越爱国军民只要依靠人民战争这一法宝，高度运用人民战争的战略战术，就能够打败敌人的一切进攻，取得辉煌的胜利。
    你集中兵力进攻吗？我的办法是：打得赢就打，打不赢就走。在这里对你有利，我就走；在那里对我有利，我就揪住你狠狠地打。能打游击战就打游击战，能打运动战就打运动战。你可以在全局上集中优势兵力在战略上分进合击，对我进行大包围、大“扫荡”；我可以用在战役和战斗上的分进合击，把你的大包围、大“扫荡”改变成为对你的小包围、小“扫荡”；能歼灭你一个连就歼灭一个连，能歼灭你一个营就歼灭一个营。这样，南越人民武装力量就能够照样掌握着战场上的主动权，把美国侵略军打得落花流水。因此，显然，美国帝国主义不论再拿出多少兵力，再发动什么样的“攻势”，都不能改变它在南越战场上被动挨打的处境，不能扭转败局。
    新华社河内一日电越南《人民军队报》二月二十八日就越南南方今年二月份战局发表评论指出：“今年二月份，是越南南方军民取得辉煌胜利的一个月，也是侵略者和卖国集团遭到惨重失败的一个月。”
    这篇题为《游击战争取得巨大胜利的月份》的评论说，二月份南越战局最突出的一点是游击战争运动正在蓬勃和广泛地发展。地方部队和游击队在击败敌人的“扫荡”和消灭美伪军有生力量的战斗中担负了重要角色。
    评论说，美国侵略者竭力集中军队向解放区展开大规模的“扫荡”，妄图给他们在中部沿海、西原地区、南部东区所建立的军事基地以及目前正在遭到解放武装力量的严重威胁的西贡市扩大“安全范围”，并妄图使解放军陷于被动应付的局面。评论指出：“然而，美国侵略者不仅不能在进攻解放武装力量的阴谋中取得主动权，恰恰相反，它却被动地陷于人民战争的层层包围之中。”
    评论说，仅在几次大战斗中，游击队就歼灭美军、伪军和帮凶军六千多名，并击落、击毁敌机近两百架。敌人在各地都陷于被分割挨打的局面。
    评论说，由于敌人集中军队进行大规模“扫荡”，使得他们暂时控制的地区变得空虚，给游击队的活动创造了有利条件。地方部队和游击队除了袭击、伏击敌人外，还深深地插入敌人的心脏，直接向敌人的主要据点进行奇袭，打得敌人惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。
    评论说，很明显，越南南方地方部队和游击队不仅有足够的能力挫败敌人的大、小规模的“扫荡”，而且还进而主动进攻敌人，摧毁敌人的一系列据点。他们一边在敌人的“扫荡”中打击敌人，同时又在敌人的后方打击敌人，打乱了敌人的反攻、蚕食和“绥靖”等一切侵略计划。
    新华社河内一日电据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方解放军二月二十四日在土龙木省边葛市东北约十一公里的芽多、蓬庄地区的反“扫荡”战斗中，一举全歼美国第一步兵师的两个营和它们的指挥部，消灭配备有四十八辆战车（其中包括M—113两栖装甲车三十辆）的两个装甲车队。此外，还重创澳大利亚帮凶军一个营。
    这是解放军继保邦、甘车、油汀等战斗以后对美国第一步兵师的又一次沉重打击。
    在这次战斗中，解放军各部队打得非常漂亮，他们怀着对美国侵略强盗的高度仇恨，迅速地越过森林和溪流，在芽多地区把敌人团团围住。二十四日凌晨，解放军各部队同时向敌人发起猛烈进攻，首先消灭了敌人的指挥部，使敌军失去指挥、惊慌万状。接着，经过四个小时的激烈战斗，解放军就完全控制了整个战场，把敌人全部歼灭。
    新华社河内一日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉定省和边和省的解放军和游击队在最近几次战斗中又打死打伤美国侵略军二百四十多名。
    嘉定省古芝县游击队在二月十四日和十八日的两天战斗中，又歼灭美国侵略军一百一十五名。
    十四日，美军两个连向新安会乡庄览村进行“扫荡”。当地游击队经过两个多小时的激烈战斗，打退了敌人的多次进攻，歼灭美国侵略军四十名，击毁M—113型两栖装甲车两辆和吉普车一辆。同一天，德协乡游击队也击退了一连美军的进攻，并且乘胜追击，打死打伤敌人三十五名。
    十八日，德协乡游击队又在公路上截击一连美军，歼敌四十名。
    越南南方边和省解放武装力量二月七日在保卫心情山解放区的战斗中，痛击前往“扫荡”的美国第一步兵师第二旅，当场打死打伤敌人一百二十七名，击落直升飞机三架，击伤一架。
