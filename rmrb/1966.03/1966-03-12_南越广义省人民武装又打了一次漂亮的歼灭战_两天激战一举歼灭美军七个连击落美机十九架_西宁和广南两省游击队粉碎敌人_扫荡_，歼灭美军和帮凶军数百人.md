    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quảng Ngãi Province, South Vietnam, engaged in fierce battles with thousands of U.S. and puppet troops on the 4th and 5th. Preliminary reports indicate that they annihilated over seven U.S. Army companies and a large number of puppet troops, shot down nineteen helicopters, destroyed two M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, and seized a large quantity of weapons and other military equipment.
    On the 4th, the enemy used helicopters to airlift thousands of U.S. and puppet troops to Vĩnh Lộc, Đồng Giáp, and Khánh Mỹ communes, as well as Hill 62, in this province, attempting to reopen Highway 1, which had long been cut off by the Liberation Armed Forces.
    As soon as these bandits landed, they were encircled and annihilated by the Liberation Armed Forces. Two U.S. Army companies were annihilated in the area east of Vĩnh Lộc and Đồng Giáp communes, and three helicopters were shot down.
    At the same time, the Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on enemy troops on Hill 62, inflicting heavy casualties and occupying the hill. They defended their positions, repelling numerous enemy counterattacks supported by aircraft and artillery. The battlefield was soon littered with the corpses of U.S. and puppet troops.
    In nearby Hòa Vĩnh commune, the Liberation Armed Forces also engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. On the night of the 4th alone, hundreds of U.S. aggressors were killed.

    四日，敌人用直升飞机把数千名美伪军空运到这个省的永禄、同甲和庆美等乡以及六二高地，妄图打通早被解放武装力量切断的一号公路。
    这些强盗一着陆，就遭到解放武装力量的围歼。两连美军在永禄和同甲乡以东地区被歼灭，三架直升飞机被击落。
    同时，解放武装力量向六二高地的敌军展开猛攻，大量杀伤敌人，并占领了这个高地。他们坚守阵地，击退了敌军在飞机和大炮配合下发动的多次反扑。战场上很快就堆满了美伪军的尸体。
    在附近的和永乡，解放武装力量也同敌人发生了猛烈的战斗。仅在四日夜间，就打死美国侵略者数百名。
    解放武装力量不让敌人有喘息的时间，咬住敌人不放。五日，他们又猛攻已经被打得狼狈不堪的敌军，歼灭美军两连，击落直升飞机十六架，和击毁M—113两栖装甲车两辆。

    广南省先福县和三岐县游击队，从二月十九日到二十二日，接连粉碎了敌人的多次“扫荡”，据不完全统计，游击队用陷阱、地雷和其他简陋武器共歼灭敌人三百五十七名，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军。此外，游击队还打落敌机十二架，摧毁敌人M—113型装甲车一辆，缴获武器一批。
