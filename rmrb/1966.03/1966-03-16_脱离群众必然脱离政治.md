    Separating from the Masses Inevitably Leads to Separation from Politics
    Why was a simple ship lift successfully designed by two young technicians with little experience and low "level," while eight experienced and "high-level" technicians failed? Fundamentally, it is because the former emphasized politics, while the latter separated from politics; it is because the former connected with the masses, while the latter separated from the masses.
    In our country, the key to doing technical work well lies in properly handling the relationship between politics and technology, which, in a certain sense, also means handling the relationship between the masses and technology. Why? First, the technical experience of the broad masses is the richest, most practical, and most in line with the needs of socialist construction. If our technicians separate themselves from the thousands upon thousands of mass technical experts, how can they develop technology according to socialist needs? Second, the broad masses are the main force in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. If our technicians do not combine with the broad masses and do not receive their help and supervision, how can they effectively carry out ideological remolding?
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Revolutionary politicians, political experts who understand the revolutionary political science or political art, are only the leaders of thousands upon thousands of mass politicians. Their task is to concentrate the opinions of the mass politicians, refine them, and then return them to the masses to be accepted and practiced by the masses, instead of closing their doors to build cars, being clever on their own, and being the only shop of its kind, the kind of aristocratic so-called 'politician'—this is the fundamental difference between proletarian politicians and corrupt bourgeois politicians."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's theory not only applies to Party workers and political workers, but also to economic workers and technical workers. Our technical workers, including all technical experts, are also only the leaders of thousands upon thousands of mass technical experts. They should, like those two young technicians, humbly learn from the masses, concentrate the creations of the masses, refine them, and make designs that are welcomed by the masses. They should not be like those eight technicians who only believe in their own books, do not believe in the wisdom of the masses, close their doors to build cars, and be clever on their own, making designs that do not meet practical needs.
    Our technical personnel can draw inspiration from this report. In our work, to highlight politics, we must establish the idea of serving the people, believing in the people, and relying on the people. This is the starting point and foothold of all our work. If we separate from the broad masses, we will fundamentally separate from politics. How can we talk about highlighting politics then?

    脱离群众必然脱离政治
    同样一个简易升船机，为什么经验少、“水平”低的两个青年技术员设计成功了，而经验多、“水平”高的八个技术人员设计失败了呢？从根本上说，是由于前者突出了政治，后者脱离了政治；是由于前者联系了群众，后者脱离了群众。
    在我们国家，做好技术工作的关键，在于处理好政治和技术的关系，从一定意义上说，也就是处理好群众和技术的关系。为什么？第一，广大群众的技术经验最丰富、最实际、最符合社会主义建设的需要，如果我们的技术人员脱离了千千万万的群众技术专家，怎么可能按照社会主义的需要发展技术呢？第二，广大群众是阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的主力军，如果我们的技术人员不同广大群众相结合，得不到他们的帮助和监督，怎么可能有效地进行思想改造呢？
    毛泽东同志说，“革命的政治家们，懂得革命的政治科学或政治艺术的政治专家们，他们只是千千万万的群众政治家的领袖，他们的任务在于把群众政治家的意见集中起来，加以提炼，再使之回到群众中去，为群众所接受，所实践，而不是闭门造车，自作聪明，只此一家，别无分店的那种贵族式的所谓‘政治家’，——这是无产阶级政治家同腐朽了的资产阶级政治家的原则区别。”
    毛泽东同志的这个理论，不但适用于党的工作者和政治工作者，同样适用于经济工作者和技术工作者。我们的技术工作者，包括所有的技术专家们，他们也只是千千万万的群众技术专家的领袖。他们应该象那两个青年技术员那样，虚心向群众学习，把群众的创造集中起来，加以提炼，作出群众欢迎的设计来。而不应该象那八个技术人员那样，只相信自己的本本，不相信群众的智慧，闭门造车，自作聪明，作出的设计却不符合实际的需要。
    我们的技术人员，可以从这篇报道中得到启示。在我们的工作当中，要突出政治，就要树立为人民、相信人民、依靠人民的思想。这是我们一切工作的出发点和落脚点。离开了广大群众，我们就从根本上脱离了政治，哪里还谈得上突出政治呢？
