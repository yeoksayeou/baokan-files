    Fight to Win; Strive for Complete Annihilation; Leave No One Uncaptured
    South Vietnamese Army and People Annihilate Six Entire U.S. Battalions in Less Than a Month
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 21st -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the heroic South Vietnamese army and people, from February 7th to March 5th, in less than a month, continuously annihilated ten entire enemy battalions, including six entire battalions of the U.S. aggressor troops and four entire battalions of the South Vietnamese puppet army.
    This number of annihilated enemy battalions is equivalent to one-fifth of the total number of enemy battalions annihilated by the South Vietnamese army and people last year (52 entire enemy battalions annihilated last year). The number of annihilated U.S. battalions is equivalent to more than half of last year's total (9 entire U.S. battalions annihilated last year). This fact once again vividly demonstrates that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces' level of annihilating battles has significantly improved, and in particular, the battles of annihilating entire U.S. aggressor battalions are becoming increasingly frequent. These ten completely annihilated U.S. and puppet army battalions are:
    On February 7th, the 1st Battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 7th Division of the puppet army was completely annihilated on Highway 4 in Mỹ Tho Province; on the night of February 14th to the early morning of February 15th, the 11th Ranger Battalion of the puppet army was completely annihilated in the Bồ Minh area in northern Quảng Nam Province;
    On February 23rd, the 1st Battalion of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the puppet army was completely annihilated in Hành Thịnh Township, Quảng Ngãi Province; on February 24th, two infantry battalions and two armored battalions of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division were completely annihilated in the Nhá Bè and Phước Vĩnh areas of Biên Hòa Province;
    From the night of February 27th to the early morning of February 28th, the 1st Battalion of the 43rd Regiment of the 10th Division of the puppet army was completely annihilated in the Vũ Sư area of Biên Hòa Province;
    On March 5th, a battalion of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division was completely annihilated in the Bàu Bàng area of Thủ Dầu Một Province;
    On March 4th and 5th, the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division was completely annihilated in the Đông Giáp, Khánh Mỹ, and Hòa Vinh areas and on Hill 62 in northern Quảng Ngãi Province.
  Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Thủ Dầu Một Province in South Vietnam fiercely attacked the enemy in the Tân Định area on the 14th, completely annihilating the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the 5th Division of the puppet army, heavily damaging the 1st Battalion, and seizing all the weapons and military supplies of the 2nd Battalion.

    战则必胜　力求全歼　不使漏网
    南越军民不到一个月全歼美军六个整营
    新华社河内二十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英雄的越南南方军民从二月七日到三月五日不到一个月的时间内，连续全歼敌人十个整营，其中包括美国侵略军六个整营和南越伪军四个整营。
    这个歼灭整营敌军的数字相当于去年南越军民歼灭整营敌军总数的五分之一（去年全歼敌军五十二个整营）。歼灭整营美军的数字相当于去年的一半多（去年全歼美军九个整营）。这一事实再一次生动表明：越南南方解放武装力量打歼灭战的水平已经显著提高，特别是整营歼灭美国侵略军的战斗已经越来越多。这十个被全歼的美军和伪军的营是：
    二月七日，在美萩省的第四号公路上全歼伪军第七师第十一团第一营；二月十四日夜间到十五日凌晨，在广南省北部的蒲冥地区全歼伪军第十一别动营；
    二月二十三日，在广义省的行盛乡全歼伪军第二师第四团第一营；二月二十四日，在边和省的芽多和蓬庄地区全歼美国第一步兵师的两个步兵营和两个装甲营；
    二月二十七日夜间到二十八日凌晨，在边和省的武苏地区全歼伪军第十师第四十三团第一营；
    三月五日，在土龙木省的保邦地区全歼美国第一步兵师的一个营；
    三月四日和五日，在广义省北部的东甲、庆美、和荣地区和六二高地上，全歼美国第三海军陆战师第三团第一营。
  据新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量，十四日在新定地区猛烈袭击敌人，全歼伪军第五师第八团第二营，重创第一营，缴获第二营的全部武器和军用物资。
