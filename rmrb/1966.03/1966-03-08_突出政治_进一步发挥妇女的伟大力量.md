    Today is March 8th International Working Women's Day. Our country's women, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, join with working women around the world to commemorate this glorious festival.
    In the past year, the broad masses of women workers and peasants, and other revolutionary women in our country, have actively studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, further enhanced their ideological awareness, and achieved tremendous achievements in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. On all fronts, many advanced women and advanced collectives who have creatively studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works have emerged, as well as many activists in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The women of Daqing and the women of Dazhai are two bright red flags of advanced women and advanced collectives on the industrial and agricultural fronts.
    Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that we must attach importance to mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in revolutionary struggles and production activities. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be tapped and fought for in order to build a great socialist country." Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out: "It is necessary to fight against the idea of ​​underestimating the women's movement, because they cannot see the role of women and ignore the great strength of women in the revolution."
    The Party Committee of Daqing Oilfield and the Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, following Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, attached importance to women's work, mobilized women to participate in revolutionary struggles and production labor, brought into play the enormous potential of the broad masses of working women, and made valuable contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    The Party Committee of Daqing Oilfield emphasized politics, conscientiously organized the families of employees to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, took class struggle and the two-road struggle as the key link, conducted class education, labor education, education on the principles of mining area construction, and education on the situation for family members, vigorously grasped the ideological revolutionization of family members, and vigorously established the idea that all work is for the sake of revolution. In order to realize the revolutionization of the families of employees, the Party Committee of Daqing Oilfield vigorously organized them to participate in class struggle and collective production labor, cultivated their thoughts and feelings as working people, and maintained the true color of working people forever. The families of employees of Daqing Oilfield gradually eliminated ideas such as underestimating labor, dependence, and inferiority, their spiritual outlook was renewed, they were liberated from the narrow small world of the family, they loved the collective, had the motherland in their hearts, looked at the world, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and building the country through diligence and thrift, and became a revolutionary labor army.
    The Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade highlighted politics, adhered to using Mao Zedong Thought as the command, educated the broad masses to attach importance to women's participation in production labor; educated the cadres of the Women's Congress to widely carry out education on promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology among the broad masses of women, highlighting politics at all times, in all matters, and in all places, seizing lively people, lively events, and lively thoughts in a timely manner, carrying out meticulous ideological and political work, taking class struggle and the two-road struggle as the key link, grasping revolution, promoting production, and establishing the idea of ​​farming for the revolution. The class consciousness of the women of Dazhai Brigade has been continuously improved, class boundaries have been clarified, the ideas of underestimating themselves and not daring to work in the fields have been overcome, the revolutionary ideas of self-reliance, hard struggle, and building a new socialist countryside have been established, their enthusiasm for labor has been fully developed, and they have become a labor army that endures hardship, is hardworking, and understands agricultural technology.
    The experience of women's work in Daqing and Dazhai has opened up a broad path for the future of women's work. The women of Daqing and the women of Dazhai, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, constantly fight against capitalist ideas and feudal remnants, closely integrate immediate interests with the long-term interests of the revolution, correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, fully develop the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, striving for strength, hard struggle, and building the country through diligence and thrift, work hard in production, and manage their households diligently and thriftily, becoming an important force in building our socialist motherland.
    Facts fully show that where Party organizations attach importance to women's work, strengthen political leadership over women's work, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously grasp the ideological revolutionization of women, good results will be achieved in work and production there, and the revolutionary strength and labor strength of women will be fully exerted. With the smooth development of women's work, it will also be possible to cultivate a large number of women activists, actively develop female Party members, boldly promote female cadres, and enrich the leadership strength of organizations at all levels.
    Party organizations at all levels should further attach importance to women's work and strengthen leadership. It is necessary to educate cadres to continue to eliminate the idea of ​​underestimating women, educate women to change the idea of ​​underestimating their own strength, implement the principle of launching both men and women in the in-depth development of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment, and lead the broad masses of women to temper and improve themselves in the torrent of struggle of the three great revolutionary movements. In struggle and work, we must give full play to the role of women's federations at all levels, and especially attach importance to giving play to the role of grassroots women's congresses, educating and helping them to go deep among the masses of women, closely contact the masses of women, carry out ideological and political work to the forefront of production, to all work, and to the hearts of women, and solve various practical problems for the masses of women. Only in this way can we better mobilize the broad masses of women, mobilize their enthusiasm, and exert their great strength in revolution and construction, and strive to complete and overfulfill the Third Five-Year Plan.

    突出政治　进一步发挥妇女的伟大力量
    今天是“三八”国际劳动妇女节。我国妇女怀着最大的革命热情，同全世界劳动妇女一起，纪念这个光辉的节日。
    我国广大工农妇女和其他革命的妇女群众，在过去一年里，积极学习毛泽东同志的著作，进一步提高了思想觉悟，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，取得了巨大的成就。在各个战线上，涌现出许许多多活学活用毛泽东同志著作的先进妇女和先进集体，涌现出许许多多社会主义革命和社会主义建设积极分子。大庆的妇女和大寨的妇女，就是工农业战线先进妇女和先进集体的两面鲜红旗帜。
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们，要重视发动广大妇女群众，参加革命斗争和生产活动。毛泽东同志指出：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”毛泽东同志又指出：“要与轻视妇女运动的观念作斗争，因为他们看不出妇女的作用，忽视妇女在革命中的伟大力量。”
    大庆油田党委和大寨党支部遵循毛泽东同志的教导，重视妇女工作，发动妇女参加革命斗争和生产劳动，发挥广大劳动妇女的巨大潜力，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出可贵的贡献。
    大庆油田党委突出政治，认真组织职工家属大学毛泽东同志著作，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，向家属进行阶级教育、劳动教育、矿区建设方针教育和形势教育，大抓家属的思想革命化，大树一切工作都是为了革命的思想。大庆油田党委为了实现职工家属革命化，大力组织她们参加阶级斗争，参加集体生产劳动，培养她们的劳动人民思想感情，永远保持劳动人民的本色。大庆油田职工家属逐步扫除了轻视劳动、依赖、自卑等思想，精神面貌一新，从狭隘的家庭小天地里解放出来，热爱集体，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的革命精神，成为一支革命化的劳动大军。
    大寨大队党支部突出政治，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，教育广大群众重视妇女参加生产劳动；教育妇代会干部在广大妇女中广泛开展兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的教育，时时事事处处突出政治，及时抓住活人活事活思想，进行细致的思想政治工作，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，抓革命，促生产，树立为革命种田的思想。大寨大队妇女的阶级觉悟不断提高，划清了阶级界限，克服了轻视自己、不敢下田劳动等思想，树立了自力更生、艰苦奋斗建设社会主义新农村的革命思想，充分发挥劳动积极性，成为一支吃苦耐劳、懂得农业技术的劳动大军。
    大庆和大寨的妇女工作经验，为今后的妇女工作，开辟了广阔的发展道路。大庆妇女和大寨妇女，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断同资本主义思想和封建残余思想作斗争，把眼前利益和革命长远利益密切结合起来，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者的关系，充分发扬自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的革命精神，努力生产，勤俭持家，成为建设我们社会主义祖国的一支重要力量。
    事实充分表明，那里的党组织重视妇女工作，加强对妇女工作的政治领导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大抓妇女思想革命化，那里的工作、生产就会获得好的成绩，妇女的革命力量、劳动力量也就得到充分发挥。随着妇女工作的顺利开展，也就能够培养出大批妇女积极分子，积极发展女党员，大胆提拔妇女干部，充实各级组织的领导力量。
    我们党的各级组织，要进一步重视妇女工作，加强领导。要教育干部继续清除轻视妇女的思想，教育妇女改变对自己力量估计不足的思想，在深入开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，贯彻执行男女一齐发动的方针，领导广大妇女到三大革命运动的斗争洪流中去锻炼，去提高。在斗争和工作中，要充分发挥各级妇联的作用，特别要重视发挥基层妇代会的作用，教育和帮助她们深入妇女群众，密切联系妇女群众，把思想政治工作做到生产第一线，做到一切工作中，做到妇女们的心里，并为妇女群众解决各种切身问题。这样，才能够更好地发动广大妇女，调动她们的积极性，发挥她们在革命和建设中的伟大力量，为完成和超额完成第三个五年计划而奋斗。
