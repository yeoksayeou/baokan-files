　　Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 28th (Electric dispatch) – Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage arrived in Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan Province, on the afternoon of March 28th, and received an extremely warm welcome from nearly one million people.

　　Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife arrived in Lahore accompanied by Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife.

　　When the special plane carrying Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife landed at Lahore Airport, young girls at the airport released many colorful balloons with the words "Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship" written on them.

　　Governor of West Pakistan, Malik Amir Muhammad Khan, was the first to walk to the front of the plane to greet Chairman Liu Shaoqi. Chairman Liu Shaoqi was introduced by the Governor to the ministers of the West Pakistan Provincial Government, members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assembly, as well as prominent figures from all walks of life.

　　Tens of thousands of welcoming people at the airport shouted slogans of Sino-Pakistani friendship and welcomed the Chinese leaders by scattering rose petals and performing folk dances from various parts of Pakistan.

　　Accompanied by the Governor, Chairman Liu Shaoqi traveled by car from the airport to the Governor's House of West Pakistan Province. Along the way, the welcoming crowds were dense, forming a sea of people. The motorcade was repeatedly blocked by the enthusiastic crowds. The five-mile route was impassable, and the cars moved at walking speed for a full hour and a half.

　　Countless workers, students, gray-haired old people, and innocent children scrambled to reach into the car windows to shake hands with the Chinese guests, shouting, "You are our true friends," and "Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship."

　　Some of the welcoming people were so excited that they were in tears, repeatedly shouting "Friendship, friendship" and "Thank you, thank you" in Chinese to express their warm friendship towards the Chinese people. In some places, the welcoming crowds shouted, "China is our closest friend," and "Down with U.S. Imperialism."

　　Even after the motorcade passed, some people were still shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong." Some even kissed the photographs of Chairman Liu Shaoqi in their hands.

　　Among the welcoming crowd, many had traveled from counties more than a hundred miles away, such as Sialkot, Gujranwala, and Multan, to welcome the Chinese leaders.

　　The city of Lahore was decorated like a festival today. Large portraits of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Ayub were erected at some bustling intersections. Numerous national flags of China and Pakistan were hung on both sides of the streets. Huge banners were also hung above the streets, written in Urdu and Chinese: "Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi," "Welcome Vice Premier Chen Yi," "Long Live Afro-Asian Solidarity," and "Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship." In the evening, the colorful light bulbs inlaid on the trees and buildings emitted a beautiful glow.

　　People all over the city were talking about the arrival of the Chinese national leaders today. Many people said that this warm welcome was unprecedented in Lahore.

　　Lahore is a heroic city. During the Indian aggression in September last year, the people and army of Pakistan heroically blocked and repelled the attacks of the Indian army here.

　　Also arriving here today on the same plane as Chairman Liu Shaoqi were Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu and other accompanying personnel, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and his wife.

　　Pakistani Ambassador to China, Rochan, also arrived on the same plane.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 28th (Electric dispatch) – The Governor of West Pakistan Province, Malik Amir Muhammad Khan, held a grand banquet at the Governor's House here on the evening of the 28th to entertain Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife.

　　At the banquet, the Governor raised his glass to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, and all other distinguished Chinese guests, to the progress and prosperity of great China, to the lasting friendship and unity between Pakistan and China, and to Afro-Asian solidarity and world peace.

　　Chairman Liu Shaoqi then raised his glass to the heroic city of Lahore and the heroic people of Lahore, and to the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan.

　　Chairman Liu said: "The Lahore area is the frontline where Pakistan heavily struck against the Indian aggressors. We are very happy to come to this heroic city. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute on behalf of the Chinese people to the heroic people of Lahore, to express our condolences to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed on all fronts, and to extend our sympathy to all the wounded brothers and to the families of the martyrs."

　　Chairman Liu also said: "Today, the masses of the people of Lahore gave us an extremely warm welcome. The streets were crowded with people, a scene of jubilation. This vividly expresses the fraternal friendship of the Pakistani people towards the Chinese people."

　　Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu and other members of Chairman Liu's entourage were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　About two hundred and fifty people attended the banquet, which was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Before the banquet began, the guests chatted happily in the living room. Their main topic was the very warm welcome that the people of Lahore gave to Chairman Liu and his entourage today. Pakistani friends talked about the many unforgettable visits to Pakistan by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi. The Governor's House and the Governor's House Garden were illuminated by countless colorful light bulbs. During the banquet, the band played Pakistani and Chinese music.

　　Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, who accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife on their visit, attended the banquet. Also attending the banquet were Pakistani Minister of Information and Broadcasting Khawaja Shahabuddin, Pakistani Air Force Commander-in-Chief Air Marshal Nur Khan, Speaker of the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly Muhammad Anwar, ministers of the West Pakistan Provincial Government, and prominent figures from all walks of life.

　　Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and Pakistani Ambassador to China Rochan also attended the banquet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 28th (Electric dispatch) – Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, left Rawalpindi on President Ayub Khan's special plane on the afternoon of the 28th for Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan.

　　President Ayub Khan and his wife went to the airport to see Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife off. Before Chairman Liu Shaoqi boarded the plane, President Ayub Khan shook hands with him warmly to say goodbye.

　　Also at the airport to see them off were: the Speaker of the Pakistani National Assembly, ministers of the central ministries, members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assembly, and prominent figures from all walks of life. Chairman Liu Shaoqi shook hands with them one by one to say goodbye.

　　Over the past three days, the citizens of Rawalpindi have given the Chinese guests the warmest reception. Every time the motorcade passed through the city, the crowds on the roadside always gave warm cheers. Today, they even more enthusiastically saw Chairman Liu and his entourage off, wishing them a safe journey. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by President Ayub Khan, went from the Presidential Guesthouse to the airport, tens of thousands of people gathered along the streets and at the airport, warmly bidding farewell to Chairman Liu and his entourage, shouting with all their might: "Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship," "Long Live Afro-Asian Solidarity," and "China is our True Friend."

　　Chairman Liu Shaoqi waved to them in thanks.

    刘主席代表中国人民向英勇打击印度侵略者的拉合尔人民致敬
    新华社拉合尔二十八日电  刘少奇主席和他的随行人员二十八日下午，从拉瓦尔品第到达西巴基斯坦省首府拉合尔的时候，受到了将近一百万人的极其热烈的欢迎。
    刘少奇主席和夫人是在巴基斯坦外交部长布托和夫人陪同下到达拉合尔的。
    当刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理和夫人乘坐的专机在拉合尔机场降落时，机场上的年轻姑娘把许多上面写着“巴中友谊万岁”的彩色气球放到高空。
    西巴基斯坦省督马利克·阿密尔·穆罕默德·汗第一个走到飞机前面迎接刘少奇主席。刘少奇主席由省督介绍给西巴基斯坦省政府的各部部长们、国民议会和省议会的议员以及当地各界知名人士。
    机场上成千上万的欢迎群众高呼中巴友好的口号，向客人们撒玫瑰花瓣和表演巴基斯坦各地的民族舞蹈来欢迎中国领导人。
    刘少奇主席在省督陪同下乘车从机场到西巴基斯坦省督府。一路上，欢迎的群众密密层层，汇成一片海洋。车队一再被热情的群众阻住，这条五英里长的路线，水泄不通，汽车用步行一样的速度走了足足一小时半。
    无数工人、学生、白发苍苍的老人和天真的儿童都争着把手伸进汽车窗口同中国客人握手，他们高呼：“你们是我们真正的朋友”，“巴中友好万岁”。
    有些欢迎群众，兴奋得热泪盈眶，一再用中国话高呼“友好，友好”和“谢谢，谢谢”，来表达他们对中国人民的热烈的友情。有些地方的欢迎群众高呼：“中国是我们最亲密的朋友”，“打倒美帝国主义”。
    甚至在车队开过之后，还有人在高呼“毛泽东主席万岁”。有些人还吻了他们手中的刘少奇主席的照片。
    在欢迎的人群中，有许多人是从一百多英里以外的锡亚尔科特、古吉兰瓦拉、木尔坦等县赶来欢迎中国领导人的。
    拉合尔市今天打扮得象过节一样。一些热闹的街口树起了刘少奇主席和阿尤布总统的大幅画象。街道两旁悬挂着许许多多中巴两国的国旗。街道上面还悬挂着巨大的横幅标语，用乌尔都文和中文写着：“欢迎刘少奇主席”，“欢迎陈毅副总理”，“亚非团结万岁”和“巴中友好万岁”。傍晚，镶挂在树上和建筑物上的彩色灯泡发出了美丽的亮光。
    全市的人们今天到处都在谈论着中国国家领导人的来到。许多人说，这次热烈的欢迎是拉合尔前所未有的。
    拉合尔是一个英雄的城市，在去年九月印度侵略期间，巴基斯坦的人民和军队在这里英勇地挡住和击退了印度军队的进攻。
    今天同刘少奇主席同机到达这里的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫和其他随行人员以及中国驻巴基斯坦大使丁国钰和夫人。
