	“The Use of 'Money in Hand'”
	Shanghai Jing'an Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory Liu Guangyi
	In each of our production units, according to the needs of development, the state allocates funds for reproduction, which is a common occurrence. How to treat this "money in hand" can sometimes reflect people's ideological state.
	There is a Dexin Metal Smelting Factory in Shanghai. Once, the state allocated 200,000 yuan to them to build a new aluminum powder workshop. Based on the spirit of using the state's money as two yuan for every one yuan, they only spent more than 20,000 yuan to complete the task, and returned all the remaining money to the state. Not only that, they also felt that if they were to make more careful calculations, it would only cost a few thousand yuan. To this end, their Party branch secretary even made a self-criticism to the workers.
	The approach of the comrades at the Dexin Factory highly embodies the collectivist ideological qualities of our working class in being diligent, thrifty, and wholeheartedly serving the public.
	However, in our real life, sometimes we encounter another situation. Some comrades believe that since this is "money in hand," as long as there is no overspending, it counts as spending it all, which is "reasonable and legal," because the state allocates the money for use! If something ordinary is sufficient, they insist on buying something "high-grade." If something is not needed for the time being, they seize the opportunity to buy a batch of it, thinking that having it is better than not having it, and anyway, if this money is not spent, it won't be ours!
	Indeed, the state allocates money to be put to use, and if it is used appropriately, it is completely appropriate and beyond reproach. But this is different from the idea of having to spend all the state's money once it is in hand. That kind of "if it's not spent, it won't be ours" mentality is actually a remnant of capitalist thinking that only considers the interests of one's own unit and disregards the overall situation.
	Our working class should learn and promote the new ideas and new customs of the comrades at the Dexin Factory and oppose the latter kind of old ideas and old work styles!

### “到手钞票”的用法

    “到手钞票”的用法
    上海静安纺织印染厂  刘广义
    在我们每个生产单位里，根据发展的需要，国家拨下来再生产的资金，这是常有的事情。如何对待这笔“到手的钞票”，有时很能从中反映出人们的思想状况。
    上海有家德新金属冶炼厂，有一次国家拨给他们二十万元，让他们新建一个铝粉车间。他们本着国家的钱一元要当二元用的精神，结果，只花了二万多元，就把事情办妥当了，余下来的钱全部交还给了国家。不仅如此，他们还觉得如果再精打细算一番，只要花几千元就行了。为此，他们的党支部书记还向工人作了检讨呢。
    德新厂同志们的这种做法，高度体现了我们工人阶级勤俭节约、一心为公的集体主义思想品质。
    但是，在我们的现实生活里，有时，也还会碰到另外一种情况，有的同志认为：这笔既是“到手的钞票”，只要不超支，用光算数，这是“合理合法”的，因为国家拨下钱来，就是给用的么！明明一般的东西就可以了，却偏偏要买
  “高级”的，明明一时还用不上的东西，机会难得，买它一批，有总比没有好，反正这笔钱不花光，也不是我们的啦！
    的确，国家拨下钱来，是要派用场的，如果用之恰当，这是完全应该，无可非议的事。但这和手里拿了国家的钱就非花光不可是两回事。那种
  “不花光也不是我们的啦”的观念，实际上是只顾本位，不顾全局的资本主义思想的残余。
    我们工人阶级应该学习、发扬德新厂同志们的新思想、新风尚，反对后一种旧思想、旧作风！
