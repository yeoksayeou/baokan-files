    Hand Tractor with Ploughing and Rotary Tillage Capabilities
    The Changzhou Tractor Factory in Jiangsu Province has recently successfully trial-produced a hand tractor capable of both ploughing and rotary tillage.
    This hand tractor is equipped with two sets of tillage implements: a ploughing traction frame and a rotary tiller. Farmers can choose either one according to their tillage requirements. The ploughing traction frame and the rotary tiller can be easily replaced, usually requiring only thirty to forty minutes to complete the replacement.
    Ploughing and sun-curing can turn crop stubble and weeds under the soil, where they decompose into fertilizer, and it also benefits soil improvement. The Gongnong-7 hand tractor originally produced by the Changzhou Tractor Factory could only perform rotary tillage and not ploughing. Rotary tillage cannot turn the soil for sun-curing, and continuous rotary tillage is also not conducive to soil maturation and cannot fully exploit soil fertility. The ploughing and rotary tillage hand tractor is a successful reform achieved by the Changzhou Tractor Factory in cooperation with relevant scientific research departments, based on the needs of farmers.
    When using this hand tractor for ploughing, attaching a double-furrow plough allows it to plough 1.4 to 1.8 mu of land per hour, with a ploughing depth of about six inches. This is deeper and faster than rotary tillage, and also saves more fuel than rotary tillage.
    This hand tractor has a reasonable structure, flexible steering, and stable and effortless operation. Because it is equipped with a small permanent magnet AC generator and lighting equipment, it can also be used for nighttime farming during busy agricultural seasons.

    犁耕旋耕兼用的手扶拖拉机
    江苏省常州拖拉机厂最近试制成功一种既能犁耕又能旋耕的手扶拖拉机。
    这种手扶拖拉机备有犁耕牵引架和旋耕机两套耕作机具，农民可以根据耕作要求自行选用。犁耕牵引架和旋耕机换装方便，一般只需要三十到四十分钟就可以换装完毕。
    犁耕晒垡可以把禾茬、杂草等翻到土底下，腐烂作肥料，而且有利于改良土壤。常州拖拉机厂原来生产的工农—7型手扶拖拉机只能旋耕，不能犁耕。旋耕不能翻土晒垡，连续旋耕也不利于土壤熟化，不能充分发挥土壤肥力。犁耕、旋耕兼用手扶拖拉机是常州拖拉机厂根据农民的要求，在有关科学研究部门的协作下改革成功的。
    使用这种手扶拖拉机犁耕的时候，挂上一副双铧犁，每小时可以耕地一点四亩到一点八亩，耕深六寸左右，比旋耕耕得深，耕得快，耗油量也比旋耕省。
    这种手扶拖拉机结构合理，转向灵活，操作平稳省力。由于它配有一台小型永磁式交流发电机和照明设备，农忙时还可以进行夜间耕作。
