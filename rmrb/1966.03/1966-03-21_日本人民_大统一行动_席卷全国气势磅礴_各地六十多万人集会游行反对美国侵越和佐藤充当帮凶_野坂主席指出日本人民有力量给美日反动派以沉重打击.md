    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 20th: Over 600,000 Japanese people from all walks of life today held a massive and vigorous "March 20th National Great Unity Action" in one hundred locations across forty-seven prefectures, from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south. The broad masses of people participating in gatherings and demonstrations in various places shouted slogans such as: "Oppose American Aggression Against Vietnam!" "Oppose the Sato Government's Assistance to the United States in Expanding the War of Aggression Against Vietnam," "Down with the Sato Cabinet!" and "Oppose Raising Prices!"
    This Great Unity Action was organized by the Central Executive Committee for the Abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," led by the Japanese Communist Party.
    In Tokyo, 225,000 people from the local area and nine neighboring prefectures participated in the central rally held at Harumi Wharf, traveling in 900 buses. These workers, farmers, working city residents, youth, women, students, small business owners, religious figures, and over 2,000 cultural figures belonged to 8,500 organizations.
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, delivered the opening address, calling on participants to wage an indomitable struggle.
    Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, attended the conference. He stepped onto the podium amidst thunderous applause. Nosaka pointed out that US imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. The Japanese Sato government is also increasingly and actively acting as an accomplice to the United States.
    Nosaka pointed out, "Sato has openly admitted that Japan will play an important role in the US nuclear aggression system. Sato also revealed that he intends to send Japanese troops to Okinawa and abroad, and to maintain the US-Japan 'Security Treaty' for a long time, which fully exposes his true intentions."
    Nosaka continued, saying that the US-Japan reactionaries are sacrificing the interests of the Japanese people, placing heavy burdens on the shoulders of workers, farmers, and small business owners, making the lives of the Japanese people unbearably difficult.
    Nosaka emphasized, "People striving for independence, democracy, and improved living conditions must unite to form a powerful united front to give the US-Japan reactionaries a heavy blow." He said, "We can confidently say that, judging from the high level of combativeness shown in today's conference, the Japanese people have a powerful force and can completely achieve this goal."
    Chairman Nosaka said that although the Japanese people's struggle will encounter many difficulties, the Japanese people will certainly be able to overcome these difficulties based on their tradition of fighting to the end, and will not be intimidated by the enemy's suppression.
    Nosaka called on the Japanese people to take today's action as a new starting point, to work harder to mobilize the masses in depth, to continue to organize struggles, and to strengthen the unity of all the people at an astonishing pace.
    Makoto Hori, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, said that today's unified action has achieved great victories across the country, severely striking the US-Japan reactionaries. The "National Unified Action to Realize Various Demands" has encouraged people from all walks of life in Japan to struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. Yoshinobu Kadoma, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Kenzo Nakajima, a representative from the cultural circles, and Sumako Fukao, a representative from the women's circles, also spoke at the conference.
    The broad masses of people attending the conference unanimously adopted a declaration, expressing their determination to use the successfully held unified action as a starting point to launch more powerful struggles on all fronts.
    The conference unanimously passed a letter to the fighting Vietnamese people, which pointed out that US imperialism is frantically escalating its war of aggression against Vietnam and is using Japan as an important base. The Sato government is cooperating with US imperialism, making Japan increasingly deeply involved in this war of aggression. The letter said, "But the more the US imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces expand their brutal war of aggression, the more Japanese and Asian people will angrily join the struggle, which will strengthen the fighting solidarity of the Japanese and Vietnamese people, making US imperialism run out of road. Victory will surely belong to the Japanese and Vietnamese people."
    The conference also passed: a resolution opposing the visit to Japan by Nguyen Cao Ky, the puppet of the United States in South Vietnam; a resolution demanding guaranteed livelihoods and striving for the victory of the workers' spring struggle; and a resolution opposing small electoral districts and tampering with the constitution.
    Amidst the storm-like applause of the masses attending the conference, the conference read out congratulatory messages from five Chinese people's organizations, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the South Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, three Korean organizations, and the Lao Patriotic Front.
    After the conference, all the participants held demonstrations in three routes. One of them held a demonstration in front of the US Embassy in Japan. Demonstrators shouted: "Yankees, go home!" "The United States get out of Asia!" Workers, farmers, and citizens from various prefectures and cities in Hokkaido and northern Japan braved blizzards to actively participate in the conference. Attendees participated in the demonstration in a fighting posture.

    日本人民“大统一行动”席卷全国气势磅礴
    各地六十多万人集会游行反对美国侵越和佐藤充当帮凶
    野坂主席指出日本人民有力量给美日反动派以沉重打击
    据新华社二十日讯　东京消息：六十多万日本各阶层人民，今天在北起北海道，南至冲绳的四十七个都、道、府、县的一百个地方举行声势浩大、气势磅礴的“三月二十日全国大统一行动”。参加各地的集会和示威游行的广大人民高呼：“反对美国侵略越南！”、“反对佐藤政府协助美国扩大侵越战争”、“打倒佐藤内阁！”和“反对抬高物价”等口号。
    这次大统一行动是日本共产党领导的废除日美
  “安全条约”中央执行委员会组织的。
    在东京，来自当地和邻近九个县的二十二万五千人，分乘九百辆公共汽车参加了在晴海码头举行的中央大会。这些工人、农民、劳动市民、青年、妇女、学生、小企业主和宗教界人士和两千多名文化界人士，属于八千五百个团体。
    日本和平委员会会长平野义太郎致开幕词，号召与会者进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三出席了大会。他在雷鸣般的掌声中走上讲台。野坂指出，美帝国主义正在疯狂扩大侵略越南的战争。日本佐藤政府也越来越积极充当美国的帮凶。
    野坂指出，“佐藤已经公开承认，日本要在美国的核侵略体制中承担重要的作用。佐藤还透露要派日本军队去冲绳和国外，以及长期保留日美‘安全条约’，这就充分地暴露了他的真正企图。”
    野坂接着说，美日反动派牺牲日本人民的利益，把重担压在工人、农民和小企业主肩上，使日本人民的生活困难得无法忍受。
    野坂强调指出，“争取独立、民主和改善生活条件的人民必须团结起来，组成强大的统一战线，给美日反动派以沉重的打击。”他说，“我们满怀信心地说，从今天的大会所显示出来的高度战斗性来看，日本人民有强大的力量，完全可以做到这一点。”
    野坂主席说，日本人民的斗争，虽然会遇到许多困难，但是，日本人民一定能够本着斗争到底的传统，克服困难，而不为敌人的镇压所吓倒。
    野坂号召日本人民以今天的行动为新的起点，更加努力地深入发动群众，继续组织斗争，以惊人的步伐加强全体人民的团结。
    中央执行委员会事务局长堀真琴讲话说，今天的统一行动在全国各地取得了巨大胜利，使美日反动派受到严重打击。“实现各项要求全国统一行动”，鼓舞了日本各阶层人民为争取独立、和平和民主而斗争。在大会上发言的还有，日本工会总评议会副议长门间吉信、文化界代表中岛健藏和妇女界代表深尾须磨子。
    到会的广大群众一致通过宣言，表示决心以今天成功地举行的统一行动作为起点，要在各条战线上开展更加有力的斗争。
    大会一致通过了致正在斗争中的越南人民的信，信中指出，美帝国主义正在疯狂地把它的侵略越南战争逐步升级，并且利用日本作为重要基地。佐藤政府同美帝国主义合作，使日本越来越深地卷入这场侵略战争。信件说，“但是美帝国主义和日本反动势力越是扩大残暴的侵略战争，越来越多的日本和亚洲人民将更愤怒地投入斗争，这个斗争将加强日本和越南人民的战斗团结，使美帝国主义走投无路。胜利一定属于日本和越南人民”。
    大会还通过：反对美国在南越的傀儡阮高其访问日本的决议、要求保障生活和争取工人春季斗争胜利的决议、反对小选举区制和篡改宪法的决议等。
    在到会群众的暴风雨般的掌声中，大会宣读了中国五个人民团体、越南保卫世界和平委员会、越南南方保卫世界和平委员会、朝鲜三个团体和老挝爱国战线党发来的贺电。
    大会结束后，全体与会者分三路举行示威游行。其中有一路在美国驻日大使馆前举行示威游行。示威者高呼：“美国佬，滚回去！”“美国从亚洲滚出去！”北海道和日本北方的许多县市的工人、农民和市民等各阶层人民冒着暴风雪积极参加了大会。到会者以战斗的姿态参加了示威游行。
