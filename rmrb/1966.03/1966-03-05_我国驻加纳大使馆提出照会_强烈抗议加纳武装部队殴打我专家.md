    Chinese Embassy in Ghana Lodges Protest
    Strongly Protesting the Assault of Chinese Experts by Ghanaian Armed Forces
    Solemnly Points Out: This deliberate provocative action damages the economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries and harms the friendly relations between the Chinese and Ghanaian people. The relevant Ghanaian authorities should apologize for this incident, punish those responsible for the incident, and effectively protect the safety of our personnel.
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 4th—The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, Huang Shixie, submitted a note to the Principal Secretary of the Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 28, lodging a strong protest with the Ghanaian authorities regarding the atrocity of Ghanaian soldiers beating Chinese experts. These experts came to Ghana to assist in construction under the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed between the Ghanaian government and the Chinese government.
    The full text of the note is as follows:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honor to state the following regarding the illegal beating of Chinese textile experts by the Ghanaian Armed Forces:
    At approximately 12:00 noon on February 27, 1966, Mr. Zhou Qinwen, head of the Chinese construction expert team of the Ghana State-owned United Textile Factory in Kpong, along with translator Jin Zhicai, expert Yuan Yuncong, and Mr. Guo Binggang, a staff member of the Chinese Embassy, were driving from Accra to the textile factory construction site. En route, a group of Ghanaian soldiers stopped the experts and demanded that they show their identity cards. When the Chinese experts explained that they came to Ghana under the economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries and that the Ghanaian government had not issued any identity cards, the soldiers forcibly searched and beat them. Subsequently, the Chinese experts were taken to the Accra police station. At the police station, the soldiers stripped the experts naked and brutally beat and kicked them with whips, rifle butts, fists, and feet for as long as one hour. Only after repeated protests and requests were they sent back to the Chinese Embassy. Hospital examinations have now confirmed that Mr. Zhou Qinwen has a fractured hip and is unable to stand. The other three also suffered multiple injuries to their bodies and heads.
    The aforementioned atrocities involving the illegal assault on Chinese experts and embassy staff, which occurred at the Accra police station, cannot but be seen as a deliberate act of provocation. It not only seriously hinders the normal work of the Chinese experts and undermines the economic and technical cooperation agreement but also harms the friendly relations between the Chinese and Ghanaian people.
    The Chinese Embassy requests that the relevant authorities apologize for this incident, punish those responsible for the incident, take effective measures to protect the safety of all staff of the Chinese Embassy, all Chinese experts, and other Chinese citizens in Ghana, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again.
    Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.
                    Embassy of the People's Republic of China
                      Accra, February 28, 1966

    我国驻加纳大使馆提出照会
    强烈抗议加纳武装部队殴打我专家
    严正指出：这种蓄意的挑衅行动，破坏两国经济技术合作协定，损害中加两国人民的友好关系。加纳有关当局应对这次事件进行道歉，惩办应对事件负责的人，有效保护我国人员的安全。
    新华社四日讯　阿克拉消息：中华人民共和国驻加纳大使馆临时代办黄世燮二月二十八日向加纳外交部主任秘书提交了一份照会，就加纳军人殴打中国专家的暴行，向加纳当局提出强烈抗议。这些专家是根据加纳政府和中国政府签订的经济技术合作协定到加纳帮助建设的。
    照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国大使馆向外交部致意并就加纳武装部队非法殴打中国纺织专家事申述如下：
    一九六六年二月二十七日中午十二时左右角旁加纳国营联合棉纺织厂中国施工专家组组长周勤文先生、翻译金智才、专家袁允从和中国大使馆工作人员郭炳刚先生正坐车从阿克拉前往纺织厂工地。在途中一群加纳士兵拦住了专家们并要他们出示身份证。当中国专家说明他们是根据两国经济技术合作协定来到加纳而加纳政府并没有发给任何身份证时，士兵们对他们进行了强行搜身和殴打。接着中国专家被带到阿克拉警察局。在警察局士兵们剥光了专家们的衣服并用鞭子、枪托、拳头和脚残暴地打踢中国专家长达一小时之久。只是由于他们一再抗议和要求，他们才被送回中国大使馆。现在医院检查证明，周勤文先生的臀骨骨折，无法站起。其余三人身体和头部也都多处受伤。
    对中国专家和大使馆工作人员进行的上述非法袭击的暴行发生在阿克拉警察局，不能不被看作是蓄意的挑衅行动。它不仅严重妨碍中国专家的正常工作，破坏经济技术合作协定，而且损害中加两国人民之间的友好关系。
    中国大使馆要求有关当局对这次事件进行道歉，惩办应对事件负责的人，采取有效措施保护中国大使馆全体人员、所有中国专家和在加纳的其他中国公民的安全，并且保证不再发生这类事件。顺致最崇高的敬意。
                    中华人民共和国驻加纳大使馆
                      一九六六年二月二十八日于阿克拉
