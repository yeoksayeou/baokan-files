    Wonderful Logic
    Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi stated that she would continue to rely on "U.S. aid." She said that the reason India accepts U.S. "aid" is to "help us get rid of the state of accepting aid."
    Accepting U.S. "aid" is to end U.S. "aid," relying on the United States is to avoid being controlled by the United States, selling out national interests is to safeguard national interests, starving the people is to let them have enough to eat...and so on. Mrs. Gandhi's logic is truly wonderful.

    奇妙的逻辑
    印度总理甘地夫人表示，将继续依靠“美援”。她说，印度接受美国“援助”的原因是“帮助我们摆脱接受援助的状态”。
    接受美“援”是为了结束美“援”，投靠美国是为了不受控于美国，出卖民族利益是为了维护民族利益，使人民群众饿死是为了让他们吃饱……如此等等。甘地夫人的这种逻辑实在奇妙得很。
