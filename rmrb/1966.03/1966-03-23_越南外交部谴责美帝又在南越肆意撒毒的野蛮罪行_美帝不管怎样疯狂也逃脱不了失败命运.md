    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 22nd - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 22nd strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's savage crimes of intensifying the use of chemical poisons and gases in its war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism that no matter how frantic and vicious it becomes, it cannot escape the fate of utter defeat in South Vietnam. Ngo Dien, Director of the Information Department of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, announced this statement at a press conference held this morning.

    The statement pointed out that since mid-1965, while sending hundreds of thousands of U.S. expeditionary forces to directly invade South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has also intensified the use of extremely inhumane warfare methods to kill the people of South Vietnam. Every day, American B-52 aircraft taking off from bases in Guam drop hundreds of tons of bombs on many villages in South Vietnam. Even more barbaric, U.S. imperialism is also increasingly using chemical poisons and gases on a large scale as a means of warfare. Recently, the U.S. authorities even blatantly declared that the U.S. military would use poison gas in "mopping-up" operations, regarding it as a "basic standard weapon." In order to step up the use of chemical poisons and gases, U.S. imperialism has moved the so-called mobile research institute of the U.S. Fourth 06 Unit, which studies chemical and bacteriological warfare, from Japan to South Vietnam, and, with the help of West German militarists, has established some poison gas production units in South Vietnam. They are also preparing to send some "special units" of the West German army to South Vietnam to help them produce and use various poison gas weapons.

    The statement pointed out that for several years, the U.S. aggressors have used a variety of high-concentration chemical poisons in South Vietnam to destroy crops, kill livestock, cause diseases, and slaughter people. According to figures recently released by the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, U.S. imperialism has expanded the scope of its use of chemical poisons from 16 provinces in 1963 to 26 provinces in 1965. The area of crops destroyed by chemical poisons in 1963 was 320,000 hectares, reaching 700,000 hectares in 1965. In areas where the United States has released chemical poisons, 50 to 60 percent of the cattle have lost their traction and reproductive capacity, young livestock have been slaughtered; thousands of people have died, and hundreds of thousands have been poisoned.

    The statement pointed out that during “mopping-up” operations, the U.S. aggressor troops wantonly used poison gas, barbarously massacring large numbers of peaceful residents, almost all of whom were elderly people, women, and children. For example, on September 5, 1965, when a battalion of U.S. troops was conducting a "mopping-up" operation in Vinh Quang village in Binh Dinh province, they released 48 bottles of poison gas into the local residents' air-raid shelters, causing 35 deaths. On February 3 and 4, 1966, when the U.S. military was conducting a "mopping-up" operation in the Bong Son area, U.S. helicopters dropped 800 poison gas bombs in the area.

    The statement said that according to the analysis of the health organizations affiliated with the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the U.S. aggressors have used a large number of high-concentration war poisons and gases, such as CN, DM, CS, etc., which have brought serious harm to the health and lives of the people of South Vietnam.

    The statement said that U.S. imperialism actually uses poison gas that even the Hitler fascists did not dare to use in South Vietnam. This is an extremely inhuman and extremely barbaric war crime. This crime of the U.S. aggressors further exposes its extremely brutal war criminal face. It is the most dangerous enemy of all nations today.

    The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly accuses and protests the above-mentioned bloody war crimes of the U.S. government and fully supports the statement of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on March 13, 1966. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly calls on the governments and peoples of socialist brother countries, the governments and peoples of all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries in the world, the American people, and all democratic organizations and progressive people to condemn the U.S. aggressors in a timely manner and resolutely demand that the U.S. government must stop using chemical poisons and gases as a means of warfare, and must withdraw all U.S. troops and their vassal troops and all weapons and equipment from South Vietnam.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle for national salvation to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland will surely achieve a brilliant victory with the increasingly strong sympathy and support of the people of the world.

    越南外交部谴责美帝又在南越肆意撒毒的野蛮罪行
    美帝不管怎样疯狂也逃脱不了失败命运
    新华社河内二十二日电  越南民主共和国外交部二十二日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义在侵越战争中加强使用化学毒药和毒气的野蛮罪行。声明严厉警告美帝国主义：不管它疯狂和凶恶到什么程度，也摆脱不了在越南南方彻底失败的命运。越南外交部新闻司司长吴田在今天上午举行的记者招待会上公布了这项声明。
    声明指出，自一九六五年年中以来，美帝国主义在派遣成十万美国远征军直接对越南南方进行侵略的同时，还加强使用极端惨无人道的战争手段来杀害越南南方人民。每天，从关岛基地起飞的美国B—52型飞机对越南南方的许多村庄投下成百吨的炸弹。更加野蛮的是，美帝国主义还日益大规模地使用化学毒药和毒气作为战争手段。最近，美国当局还明目张胆地宣称，美军要在“扫荡”中使用毒气，把它看作是一种“基本标准武器”。为了加紧使用化学毒药和毒气，美帝国主义把研究化学细菌战争的美国第四零六部队的所谓机动研究所从日本移驻到越南南方，并在西德军国主义者的帮助下，在越南南方设立了一些毒气生产单位。它们还准备把西德军队的一些“特别单位”派遣到越南南方，帮助它们生产和使用各种毒气武器。
    声明指出，几年来，美国侵略者在越南南方使用了多种高浓度的化学毒药，来破坏庄稼，杀害牲畜，制造疾病，残杀人民。根据越南南方民族解放阵线最近公布的数字，美帝国主义把使用化学毒药的范围，从一九六三年的十六个省，扩大到一九六五年的二十六个省。一九六三年被化学毒药毁坏的庄稼的面积为三十二万公顷，一九六五年达七十万公顷。在美国撒放了化学毒药的地区，百分之五十到百分之六十的耕牛丧失了牵引力和繁殖力，幼小的牲畜被杀光；有上千人死亡，成十万人中毒。
    声明指出，美国侵略军在
  “扫荡”过程中，肆意使用毒气，野蛮地残杀了大批和平居民，其中几乎全都是老人、妇女和儿童。如一九六五年九月五日，一营美军在对平定省荣光村进行“扫荡”时，向当地居民的防空洞施放了四十八瓶毒气，致使三十五人死亡。一九六六年二月三日和四日，美军在蓬山地区进行“扫荡”时，美国直升飞机在这个地区投下了八百颗毒气弹。
    声明说，据越南南方民族解放阵线所属的卫生机关的分析，美国侵略者使用了大批高浓度的战争毒药和毒气，如CN，DM，CS等，给越南南方人民的健康和生命带来了严重的危害。
    声明说，美帝国主义在越南南方竟然使用过去希特勒法西斯都不敢使用的毒药和毒气，这是一种极其惨无人道和极端野蛮的战争罪行。美国侵略者的这种罪行更加暴露了它的极其残暴的战犯面目。它是当代各民族的最危险的敌人。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府强烈控诉和抗议美国政府的上述血腥的战争罪行，完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六六年三月十三日的声明。越南民主共和国政府恳切呼吁社会主义兄弟国家政府和人民、世界上爱好和平和主持正义的各国政府和人民、美国人民以及各民主组织和进步人士，及时谴责美国侵略者，坚决要求美国政府必须停止使用化学毒药和毒气作为战争手段，必须从越南南方撤走全部美军及其仆从军和一切武器装备。
    声明最后说，越南人民为了保卫自己祖国的独立和自由的抗美救国斗争，在全世界人民日益强有力的同情和支持下，必定取得辉煌的胜利。
