    March 25th and 26th mark an important page in the history of the American people's struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam. On these two days, the broad masses of people in many cities across the United States took to the streets, expressing their attitude towards the U.S. government's persistence in its aggression against Vietnam through practical actions of struggle and clear political slogans: they oppose this dirty colonial war. This just action by the American people is a heavy blow to the Johnson government, which pursues a policy of war and aggression, and a powerful support for the Vietnamese people, who hold high the banner of resistance against America and for national salvation. The American people, inside the reactionary fortress of U.S. imperialism, are continuing their struggle, winning the respect and praise of all peace-loving, anti-aggression, and justice-upholding countries and peoples around the world.
    The raging fire of the American people's opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam was ignited in February last year. Over the past year, this nationwide movement has developed wave upon wave, displaying new characteristics.
    First, the spearhead of the struggle is clearly directed at U.S. imperialism.
    Throughout American history, there have been many anti-war movements. Because the circumstances of each war are different, the scale and nature of the anti-war movements have also been different, and most have occurred before the wars. During the Korean War, there were also anti-war actions in the United States, but they were generally opposed to war. Currently, as the war of aggression against Vietnam is underway, the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam is unfolding increasingly widely and deeply. Although this movement is initiated by various organizations with varying political positions, the spearhead of the struggle has begun to point to the Johnson government's foreign policy of aggression, and to the U.S. imperialist system. The emergence of slogans such as "The imperialist system is the foundation of the war of aggression against Vietnam" and "This system must be destroyed" is a new phenomenon on the American horizon. It marks the awakening of the American people.
    Second, the struggle has broad mass participation, and the struggle is becoming increasingly fierce and diverse in form.
    Over the past year, the number of participating groups and people has increased, and the areas involved have expanded. In the course of the struggle, the American people have used various methods: demonstrations, rallies to protest, distributing leaflets, refusing to enlist, self-immolation through hunger strikes, and so on, forming a magnificent momentum. Spreading the propositions of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to the American people, supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and launching propaganda to the U.S. soldiers invading Vietnam, calling on them to refuse to participate in the war of aggression, are even more important developments in the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The increasing number of Americans joining the anti-war movement has profound reasons. U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is also a challenge to the American people. With each step the Johnson government takes in expanding the war, it demands further sacrifices from the American people. In Johnson's words, it is to demand that the American people pay more "blood, sweat, and tears" on this "long and arduous road" of aggression against Vietnam. The American people understand that when U.S. imperialism launches wars of aggression abroad, it is bound to intensify its exploitation and plunder at home. Therefore, the American people's struggle will inevitably expand with the "gradual escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Third, the Black struggle is beginning to combine with the anti-war movement against Vietnam.
    In the American Black people's struggle against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights, slogans against the war of aggression against Vietnam have appeared. Similarly, in the ranks of the American anti-war movement, Black people are gradually becoming an important force. The gradual convergence of the increasingly high anti-war movement and the deeply developing Black struggle is an important sign that the American people's strength is growing and expanding. American Blacks are at the bottom of society, enslaved, oppressed, and discriminated against. They are an important revolutionary force in the United States. They are increasingly recognizing that the executioners who send troops to invade Vietnam, the culprits who infringe upon the interests of the majority of Americans, are also the masterminds behind the oppression of Black people. They have shouted the battle cries "Vietnam and Watts - engaging in the same struggle" and "We are not going to Vietnam." It can be asserted that, with the awakening of the American Black people and the continued development of the Black struggle, and with the further combination of the American Black struggle and the anti-war movement against Vietnam, the American people's revolutionary movement will be pushed to a new stage.
    The vigorous development of the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam is a manifestation of the increasingly acute class struggle and national struggle within the United States. In the United States, only the American ruling class benefits from the war of aggression. On this issue, the interests of the broad masses of the American people and the American ruling group are completely opposed. Therefore, as long as the Johnson government fights one more day on the Vietnamese battlefield, this contradiction will intensify by one point. This increasingly acute contradiction is like a volcano, with hot lava churning underground every day. Today's U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that U.S. imperialism "has done many bad things to the world, it is only the American ruling group that is not good, the American people are very good." The American people are a great people, a people with a tradition of struggle and a revolutionary spirit. Today, the anti-war movement against Vietnam is rising on the American continent, once again proving that the American people are able to distinguish right from wrong, know how to identify enemies and friends, and dare to fight. In the final analysis, in the United States, the real power lies not in the American ruling group that controls the state apparatus, but in the American people who are increasingly awakening, uniting, and persisting in fighting. The future of the United States must belong to the American people.
    The Chinese people have always believed that the American people are our friends. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and American people. The Chinese people extend a fighting salute to the American people who oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the American people, united with the heroic Vietnamese people, and united with all the people of the world who oppose aggression and love peace, will defeat the Johnson government's adventurous plan to invade Vietnam and expand the war.

### 向英勇斗争的美国人民致敬

    向英勇斗争的美国人民致敬
    三月二十五日和二十六日，是美国人民反对侵越战争斗争史上重要的一页。这两天里，美国许多城市的广大人民，走上街头，以斗争的实际行动和鲜明的政治口号，向坚持侵略越南的美国政府表示了自己的态度：他们反对这一场肮脏的殖民战争。美国人民的这一正义行动，是对奉行战争政策和侵略政策的约翰逊政府的沉重打击，也是对高举抗美救国斗争大旗的越南人民的有力声援。美国人民在美帝国主义反动堡垒的内部，再接再厉，坚持斗争，博得了全世界一切爱好和平、反对侵略和主持正义的国家和人民的敬佩和赞扬。
    美国人民反对侵越战争的熊熊烈火，是从去年二月点燃起来的。一年多来，这一全国规模的运动，一浪高一浪地向前发展，呈现了崭新的特点。
    第一，斗争的矛头明确指向美帝国主义。
    美国历史上，曾多次出现过反战运动。由于每次战争的情况不同，反战运动的规模、性质也就不同，而且大都发生在战争之前。在侵朝战争期间，美国也曾出现过反战行动，但只是一般地反对战争。目前，正当侵越战争进行之际，美国人民的反对侵越战争运动，日益广泛、日益深入地展开。尽管发起这一运动的，有各种各样的组织，它们的政治立场不尽相同，但是，斗争的矛头已开始指向约翰逊政府的对外侵略政策，指向美国的帝国主义制度。“帝国主义制度是侵越战争的基础”，必须“摧毁这个制度”，类似这样的口号的出现，是美国地平线上的新事物。它标志着美国人民正在觉醒起来。
    第二，斗争具有广泛的群众性，斗争日益激烈，形式多样。
    一年多来，参加斗争的团体和人数越来越多，涉及的地区越来越广。在斗争的进程中，美国人民运用了各种方式：示威游行，集会抗议，散发传单，拒绝入伍，绝食自焚，等等，形成了波澜壮阔的声势。向美国人民宣传南越民族解放阵线的主张、支持越南人民的斗争，向侵越美军士兵展开宣传，号召他们拒绝参加侵略战争，更是美国人民反对侵越战争运动的重要发展。
    美国越来越多的人投入反对侵越战争运动，有着深刻的原因。美帝国主义侵略越南，同时也是对美国人民的挑战。约翰逊政府在扩大战争的道路上跨出一步，就要求美国人民作出进一步的牺牲。用约翰逊的话来说，就是要美国人民在侵略越南这“一条长期而艰苦的道路”上付出更多的“血、汗和眼泪”。美国人民懂得，美帝国主义对外发动侵略战争，对内就必然要加紧剥削掠夺。因此，美国人民的斗争，必然随着侵越战争的“逐步升级”而逐步扩大。
    第三，黑人斗争同反对侵越战争运动开始结合起来。
    在美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的斗争中，出现了反对侵越战争的口号。同样地，在美国反对侵越战争运动的行列中，黑人逐渐成为一支重要的力量。日益高涨的反战运动同深入发展的黑人斗争的逐步汇合，是美国人民力量正在成长壮大的重要标志。美国黑人在社会中处于被奴役、被压迫和被歧视的底层。他们是美国的一支重要的革命力量。他们日益认清，派兵侵略越南的刽子手、侵犯美国大多数人利益的罪魁，也就是压迫黑人的祸首。他们喊出了“越南和瓦茨区——从事同一个斗争”、“我们不去越南”的战斗口号。可以断言，随着美国黑人的觉醒和黑人斗争的继续开展，随着美国黑人斗争同反对侵越战争运动的进一步结合，必将把美国人民革命运动推向一个新阶段。
    美国人民反对侵越战争运动的蓬勃发展，是美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现。在美国，从侵略战争中得到好处的，只是美国的统治阶级。在这一问题上，广大的美国人民同美国统治集团之间的利益，是完全对立的。因此，只要约翰逊政府在越南战场上多打一天，这一矛盾就要加剧一分。这种日益尖锐的矛盾，就象一座火山，炽热的熔岩每天都在地下翻滚。今天的美帝国主义，就是坐在这座火山上。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出，美帝国主义“对全世界做了许多坏事，只是美国的统治集团不好，美国人民是很好的”。美国人民是伟大的人民，是有斗争传统和革命精神的人民。今天，反对侵越战争运动在美国大陆上兴起，再一次证明美国人民是能够分辨是非的，是懂得识别敌友的，是敢于斗争的。归根到底，在美国，真正有力量的，不是掌握着国家机器的美国统治集团，而是日益觉醒、团结起来、坚持战斗的美国人民。未来的美国，是一定要属于美国人民的。
    中国人民一向认为，美国人民是我们的朋友。美帝国主义是中美两国人民的共同敌人，中国人民向反对侵越战争的美国人民致以战斗敬礼。中国人民深信，美国人民同英勇的越南人民团结起来，同全世界反对侵略、爱好和平的人民团结起来，必将挫败约翰逊政府侵略越南和扩大战争的冒险计划。
