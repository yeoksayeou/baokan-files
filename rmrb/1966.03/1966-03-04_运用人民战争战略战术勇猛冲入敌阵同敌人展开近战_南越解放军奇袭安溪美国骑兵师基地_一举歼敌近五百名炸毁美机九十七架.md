    South Vietnamese Liberation Army Launches Surprise Attack on An Khe American Cavalry Division Base, Annihilating Nearly 500 Enemy Troops and Destroying 97 American Aircraft
    Saigon-Gia Dinh People's Armed Forces Encircle American Infantry Division Stronghold near Cu Chi, Annihilating 1,700 Enemy Troops
    Hanoi, March 3 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on the night of February 19th to the early morning of the 20th, the Gia Lai Province Liberation Army of South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on the base of the American 1st Cavalry Division stationed in An Khe, eliminating 497 enemy troops, destroying 97 aircraft of various types, destroying a communications base, and burning many barracks and warehouses.
    The report stated that just as the American 1st Cavalry Division was mired in a disastrous defeat and its "mopping-up" operations in the Bong Son area of Binh Dinh province were repeatedly dealt heavy blows, the Gia Lai Province Liberation Army, on the night of February 19th to the early morning of the 20th, bravely launched a fierce offensive against the lair of this American 1st Cavalry Division stationed in An Khe. The Liberation Army divided into several routes, attacking the American communications base on Han Guang Hill, four kilometers northwest of An Khe, the American troops guarding this base, the airfield, the power plant, warehouses, and barracks.
    At the start of the battle, the Liberation Army fiercely bombarded the American troops, causing them to be panic-stricken and chaotic. At the American communications base, Liberation Army soldiers bravely crossed many barbed wire fences and minefields, stormed into the base, and engaged in close combat with the enemy, completely annihilating the American troops and American communications technicians guarding the radio station. The Liberation Army completely destroyed this communications base and planted the flag of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on Han Guang Hill. As wave after wave of shells rained down on the airfield, warehouses, and enemy barracks, fierce fires raged, burning from deep into the night until the next day. The American airfield was completely paralyzed and could not be used for several days. Faced with the Liberation Army's offensive, the American bandits were thrown into complete disarray, with many American troops cowering in fortifications, afraid to resist.
    After annihilating a large number of enemies and controlling the area for several hours, the Liberation Army safely withdrew to its base area.
    Hanoi, March 3 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the local forces and guerrillas of the Liberation Army in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam recently encircled the stronghold of the 3rd Brigade of the American 1st Infantry Division in the Beihe area near Cu Chi County, annihilating more than 1,700 American troops.
    The Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam issued a battle report on February 26, announcing this glorious achievement. The battle report stated that following the disastrous defeat of a large number of American invading troops in the "mopping-up" operation against the northern liberated area of Cu Chi County from January 8 to 19 (in which more than 1,600 American, Australian, and puppet troops were annihilated, 84 American aircraft were shot down, and 56 military vehicles were destroyed), on January 24, the 3rd Brigade of the American 1st Infantry Division occupied some small strongholds in the Beihe area, two kilometers away from Cu Chi County, attempting to use them as springboards for further attacks on the liberated area and to control Highway 8 in order to connect the strongholds of Thu Dau Mot province with Long An, forming a northern forward defense line protecting Saigon.
    The battle report stated that during the month from January 24 to February 24, the local forces of the Liberation Army and the guerrillas of Xin'anhui, Dexie, Fuyong'an and other townships tightly encircled these American bandits, attacking the enemy day and night. A total of more than 1,700 American troops were annihilated.
    The battle report stated that despite the presence of more than 4,000 American troops in Cu Chi, the enemy was still helpless to change the situation in this area during the period when these American troops were besieged. The puppet military strongholds in nearby Taimei, Zhonghe, Gaipai, and Dongfuhe were also tightly encircled by the guerrillas and could not move.
    The battle report commended the units and soldiers who had made outstanding contributions in the battle to annihilate the American bandits, as well as the local people who actively assisted the soldiers in annihilating the American bandits.
    The battle report stated that looking back at the achievements made in encircling and annihilating the American bandits in the Beihe area of Cu Chi County over the past month, we can be even more certain that the people's war is invincible, and the soldiers and civilians of Cu Chi not only have sufficient strength to defeat large-scale "mopping-up" operations by the puppet troops or American troops, but also can encircle and annihilate large numbers of enemies in the strongholds, deeply and fiercely attack the enemy's various important bases, and inflict fatal blows on the enemy.
    Hanoi, March 3 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the soldiers and civilians in the northern region of Cu Chi County, Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam, once again thwarted the "mopping-up" operations of the American invading forces in the four days from February 21 to 24, killing and wounding more than 130 American troops and destroying and damaging 24 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.
    On February 21, the American bandits dispatched many armored vehicle teams to carry out "mopping-up" operations in Luc Hung Township and Phu My Hung Township, located at the junction of Tay Ninh Province and Gia Dinh Province, in an attempt to coordinate with the enemy forces carrying out "mopping-up" operations in the southern region of Zhan Pen County, Tay Ninh Province.
    The soldiers and civilians in the northern region of Cu Chi County engaged in fierce battles with the enemy, resolutely thwarting the enemy's "mopping-up" operations. Many soldiers bravely engaged in close combat with the enemy, waiting for the enemy's armored vehicles to approach before rushing up and using hand grenades to destroy them.
    On the night of February 22, the guerrillas also attacked the American troops stationed at the Bien Mang stronghold, destroying three enemy tents and annihilating 27 American troops.

    运用人民战争战略战术勇猛冲入敌阵同敌人展开近战
    南越解放军奇袭安溪美国骑兵师基地  一举歼敌近五百名炸毁美机九十七架
    西贡—嘉定人民武装在古芝附近包围美国步兵师据点歼敌一千七
    新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉莱省解放军二月十九日夜晚至二十日凌晨向驻扎在安溪的美国第一骑兵师的基地发动猛烈攻击，一举消灭敌军四百九十七名，炸毁各种类型飞机九十七架，摧毁通讯基地，烧毁许多兵营和仓库。
    报道说，正当美国第一骑兵师陷入惨败的困境，在平定省蓬山地区的“扫荡”接连遭到沉重打击的时候，嘉莱省解放军在十九日夜晚至二十日凌晨，勇猛地向驻扎在安溪的这个美军第一骑兵师的巢穴发动猛烈进攻。解放军分成数路，袭击距安溪西北四公里的汉光高地的美军通讯基地、看守这个基地的美军部队、停机场、发电厂、仓库和军营。
    战斗一开始，解放军猛烈炮击美军，使敌人惊恐万状，乱成一片。在美军通讯基地，解放军战士们勇敢地越过许多道铁丝网和地雷区，冲进基地，同敌人展开近战，全歼看守电台的美军和美国通讯技术人员。解放军全部摧毁了这个通讯基地，并在汉光高地上插上了越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。当一排排炮弹暴风雨般地落到了停机场、仓库和敌人的兵营时，烈火熊熊地燃烧起来，从深夜一直燃烧到第二天。美军机场完全陷入瘫痪状态，接连多天不能使用。在解放军的进攻面前，美国强盗乱成一团，许多美军龟缩在工事里，不敢抵抗。
    解放军在歼灭了大量敌人，并控制这一地区达数小时后，安全撤回根据地。
    新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区解放军地方部队和游击队，最近一个月内在古芝县城附近的北河地区，包围美国第一步兵师第三旅的据点，歼灭美军一千七百多名。
    越南南方西贡—嘉定地区解放武装力量指挥部在二月二十六日发表战报，公布了这一辉煌的战果。战报说，继大批美国侵略军从一月八日到十九日对古芝县北部解放区展开的“扫荡”遭到惨败后（其中有一千六百多名美、澳、伪军被歼，八十四架美机被击落，五十六辆军车被击毁），一月二十四日，美国第一步兵师的第三旅，占领了离古芝县城两公里的北河地区的一些小据点，企图将它们作为再次向解放区进攻的跳板，并控制第八号公路，以便把土龙木省的各个据点同隆安接连起来，形成保护西贡的北面前沿防线。
      战报说，从一月二十四日起到二月二十四日的一个月期间，解放军的地方部队和新安会、德协、福永安等乡的游击队，把这批美国强盗紧紧地包围起来，日夜袭击敌人。前后歼灭美军一千七百多名。
    战报说，在这些美军被围期间，尽管在古芝驻有四千多名美军，但敌人仍然毫无办法改变这一地区的局势。附近的泰美、中和、盖牌和东富和等伪军据点，也被游击队紧紧包围，动弹不得。
    战报表彰了在歼灭美国强盗战斗中建立了卓越功勋的各单位和战士，以及积极协助战士们歼灭美国强盗的当地人民。
    战报说，回顾一个月来在古芝县北河地区围歼美国强盗所取得的成绩，我们可以更加肯定地说，人民战争是无敌的，古芝军民不仅有足够的力量挫败伪军或美军的大规模“扫荡”，而且还能够包围和歼灭在据点里的大批敌人，深入地猛攻敌人的各个重要基地，给敌人以致命的打击。
    据新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉定省古芝县北部地区军民在二月二十一日到二十四日的四天中，再次挫败了美国侵略军队的“扫荡”，打死、打伤美军一百三十多名，击毁、击伤M—113型两栖装甲车二十四辆。
    二月二十一日，美国强盗出动了许多个装甲车队，向位于西宁省和嘉定省交界地区的禄兴乡和富美兴乡进行“扫荡”，企图同向西宁省盏盆县南面地区展开“扫荡”的敌军互相配合。
    古芝县北部地区军民同敌人展开了激烈的战斗，坚决挫败敌人的“扫荡”。许多战士英勇地同敌人展开近战，等待敌人的装甲车驶到靠近时才冲上去用手雷炸毁它们。
    二月二十二日夜晚，游击队还袭击了驻扎在边芒据点的美军，击毁敌人篷帐三个，歼灭美军二十七名。
