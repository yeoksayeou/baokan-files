    Adhere to the Victory of Scientific Experimentation
    ——The First Metallurgical Construction Company's Experience in Using a Large Amount of Slag to Replace Natural Stone
    The First Metallurgical Construction Company
    Should high furnace heavy slag be used as building stone, or should it be discarded as waste? This has been a long-standing debated issue in metallurgical industrial production and basic construction. High furnace heavy slag is actually nothing more than man-made stone regenerated after natural limestone and the rock components of iron ore are melted in the high furnace. It is a completely usable man-made stone material. However, it took a relatively long time to reach this understanding.

      Transforming Waste into Useful Materials

    In 1962, when we started construction of the wheel and tire factory, because the local building stone could only meet the needs of municipal construction, the building stone needed for the wheel and tire factory project had to be transported from afar, the nearest being more than 100 kilometers, and the furthest being more than 500 kilometers. Due to the long transportation distance and multiple loading and unloading, the average price per cubic meter of gravel delivered to the construction site was as high as 25 yuan. However, the high furnace heavy slag of the local steel plant piled up like mountains, occupying a lot of space; in order to dispose of the slag, railways were built, consuming a lot of manpower and funds.
    We decided to experiment with using high furnace heavy slag as building stone.
    At the beginning, we crushed and screened the accumulated high furnace heavy slag into heavy slag gravel, which was used as aggregate for heat-resistant concrete. Through a series of experiments, it was proved that its heat resistance completely met the requirements. In order to effectively ensure the quality of the project, more cautious technical regulations were also made, strictly limiting the content of uneven components (glassy and porous bodies) in the heavy slag, and even using a large amount of manpower for manual selection.
    The use of heavy slag heat-resistant concrete in some important projects aroused many ideas in us: Since heavy slag can be used for heat-resistant concrete, why can't it be used for ordinary concrete that does not require heat resistance? What are the technical performance differences between heavy slag gravel and natural gravel (mainly limestone and gravel)? What is the impact of uneven components in heavy slag gravel? Is it necessary to spend so much manpower picking them out?
    Thus, a series of comparative tests between heavy slag gravel and limestone gravel began. The results of the tests showed that many of the technical properties between the two were similar. One of the main properties—compressive strength—was in the range of 300 to 1400 kilograms per square centimeter for both, and some heavy slag was as high as 2500 kilograms per square centimeter. Therefore, both can meet the requirements of ordinary concrete for the strength of aggregate. The uneven components in the heavy slag gravel, because the actual content only accounts for 20% of the total, the impact on the concrete is minimal, so the manual selection process is not necessary.
    On this basis, the work of replacing limestone gravel with heavy slag gravel was carried out, first in minor engineering structures, and gradually in important engineering structures. Due to the reduction of the manual selection process, the unit price of heavy slag gravel produced according to certain specifications was reduced to 9 yuan per cubic meter; heavy slag that did not pay attention to specifications cost more than 2 yuan per cubic meter. This is much more economical than the unit price of 25 yuan per cubic meter for limestone.
    On the basis of gradually successful experiments, the scope of use was gradually expanded, and all technical requirements were made as clear as possible, so that the promotion work was placed on the basis of ensuring quality from the beginning.
    After this series of work, the application scope of slag in concrete was expanded from the factory building cushion to column foundations, channels, beams, slabs, chimneys, ordinary equipment foundations, important equipment foundations, and various parts of civil buildings. Except for important structures such as concrete roof trusses, columns, and crane beams, which were not promoted due to the lack of experimental data such as fatigue strength (these data cannot be obtained under the conditions of our company and can only be completed under the equipment and instruments of the research institute), slag almost occupied all the positions originally occupied by limestone.

          Three Debates

    Since slag can be used more and more widely in concrete, can it be used on highways? Can it be used on railways? Can it be used on foundations? Since it is increasingly proving that its physical and chemical properties are very similar to natural limestone, can all the places where limestone gravel was used in the past be replaced by slag?
    In the summer of 1963, the entire ring road around the factory was about to begin construction. According to the original design drawings, the roadbed and pavement of these roads were made of natural gravel. However, from the preparation stage of construction, we built the temporary construction roads on the position of the formal roads, and the roadbed of the temporary roads was all made of slag. This raised a question: Should the slag layer, which has been repeatedly rolled by busy heavy-duty transport vehicles (up to 1,700 vehicles per day and night) for one to two years, be dug up and replaced with a limestone layer transported from hundreds of kilometers away? Or should this base layer be fully utilized? Based on the situation of its use in concrete, we were confident in using slag, but because the personnel responsible for the specific design were not at the construction site, a consensus could not be reached, and the written replies required digging up the slag and replacing it with limestone. In order to unify thinking and understanding, experiments were carried out item by item to address the doubts raised, especially load tests were carried out on the highway. The results of the tests proved that the longer the road runs, the higher the road surface strength. It reached four times the design required value after one and a half years of traffic, and six times after two years of traffic. At the same time, the problems of durability, abrasion resistance, and drainage of slag roadbeds and pavements were also solved in the experiment. As a result, slag was widely promoted in the entire factory area highway.
    Why must railways transport limestone gravel from hundreds of kilometers away for roadbeds? Why can't slag gravel be used? The technical personnel who originally designed the railway still had many concerns. How is the wear resistance? How is the impact resistance? How is the drainage? How is the water absorption? Will it affect the corrosion of steel rail parts? Can it withstand the operation of locomotives, etc.?
    The only way to resolve these differences was through experiments. In addition to indoor experiments, actual test paving of a certain length (more than 100 meters long section) was also carried out. After experiments and practice, it was proved that using slag gravel as a railway roadbed can achieve good quality and is economical. As a result, slag was gradually used as a railway roadbed from tertiary lines to secondary lines and even to primary lines.
    The third debate took place in 1964. When the replacement of limestone with slag in concrete had gained two years of experience, and everything seemed to be going smoothly, new problems arose in another part of the wheel and tire factory project due to the change of a design institute. The doubts about slag were a series of: Slag will continue to decompose in concrete after a long time! Slag will corrode steel bars (the unevenness of slag cannot guarantee quality)! Slag is prone to cracks in thin-walled concrete components! They even worried that: buildings built with slag concrete would collapse in a few years and crush the second generation to death! Therefore, they firmly disagreed with using it on this project. At that time, some comrades among us said: "Anyway, the amount of the project is not much, and it will not save much money. It is not worth arguing about it. Let's just not use it!" However, most people did not agree with this view and believed that: it is not surprising that the new design unit repeatedly raised problems that had already been solved. Because they don't understand it and are not familiar with it, they don't have a bottom line in their hearts. At this time, we should help them understand, familiarize themselves with it, and have a bottom line in their hearts, so that they no longer worry or fear, and transform them from a doubter of slag utilization into an active supporter of slag utilization. If we give up this work casually, it would be irresponsible to the revolutionary cause, not only causing waste, but also equivalent to putting a question mark on the projects that have used hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of slag in the past. It just so happened that during this period, the *People's Daily* published an article entitled *A Revolution in Cotton Fields* and an editorial entitled *Enthusiastically Supporting the Seedlings of New Things*. We combined the study of Chairman Mao's works and organized the study of these two articles. Everyone unanimously demanded that the new things such as slag utilization be supported to the end.
    In order to help this design unit and eliminate every technical doubt, we assigned the director of the technical department to go to make a detailed introduction with all the test data, and also held a slag exhibition, exhibiting more than 20 charts, more than 40 sets of test pieces and physical objects. And accompanied them to visit the measures taken to eliminate cracks in thin-walled structures. After this series of work, this design unit changed from opposing the use of slag to actively supporting the use of slag.
    Through these three debates, we have realized that any new thing will not be smooth sailing in its development process. Many ups and downs are inevitable. Only by adhering to scientific experimentation, adhering to the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and adhering to a patient attitude of persuasion to reach a unified understanding can we do things well.

          Mass Experimentation

    Slag has gradually developed from being used in very small parts and in small quantities to becoming the main building stone on construction sites. In the middle of this process, mass experimentation played a great role.
    One characteristic of this mass experiment is doing experiments with questions. Whether from a design point of view, a usage point of view, or a construction point of view, experiments were conducted whenever doubts were raised. A total of 43 projects and more than 2,600 sets of test pieces were made. We believe that no matter what questions people raise, there should be answers to any doubts. All questions must be thoroughly investigated to get to the bottom of them. For example, some people suggested that the drainage performance of slag used on railways may not be good, and also suggested that slag has high water absorption, which would affect the subgrade soil to soften and mud. These problems seemed small, and there were no standard test methods. We came up with our own test methods, sampled and screened from the actual test paving line, measured the mud content, and measured the subgrade moisture content to answer these two questions, indicating that the drainage performance of slag is good, and although the water absorption is higher, it is only 1.5% to 3% higher, which will not affect the subgrade soil to soften and mud. This relieved the concerns of those who were worried.
    Another characteristic of the experiment is that it is combined with actual investigation. On the one hand, it is done in the laboratory, and on the other hand, it is tested on unimportant parts or temporary projects, and the projects several years ago are investigated on the spot. For example, will slag decompose in concrete? Will steel bars rust in slag concrete? Although the experiments done in the laboratory are very clear, some people still worry about what will happen after a few years or decades? We investigated more than 20 actual projects, some a year ago and some up to six years ago. The common rule is; all those wrapped in concrete have no rust, and all those whose concrete was knocked off and the steel bars were exposed to the atmosphere rust very quickly. It can be seen that it is air and water that corrode the steel bars, not slag concrete. And none of the slag concrete has any decomposition phenomena. This dispelled the doubts of the users.
    Another characteristic of the experiment is that it is carried out by people at all levels and from all directions. Workers, technicians, and leading cadres all participate in the experiment. Not only the central laboratory of the construction company and the laboratories of each engineering company conducted experiments, but also the construction site and processing plant conducted experiments. The central laboratory broke the old framework of the past, and all professional experimental groups in the laboratory started to conduct experiments together, thus answering many questions that had been hanging for a long time in the past. Because science is interconnected, relying solely on one professional group cannot answer the questions.
    Another characteristic of the experiment is that it is treated seriously, strictly required, and a concentrated force is adopted to fight a war of annihilation, and we will never stop until we get results. More than 1,500 sets of test pieces had been made for the slag experiment before 1964, answering most of the questions. However, some experiments were still relatively rough. In order to be highly responsible for the wheel and tire factory project, responsible for the Party and the country, and to further promote this experience, we insisted on making more than 1,100 sets of test pieces in 1964, and even reserved test pieces for ten or twenty years later. In repeated experiments, it can be seen that the difference between strictness and non-strictness is very large. For example, when using slag to process and polish into cubes for strength testing, the readings when crushing under the press can differ by about 30% for surfaces that are horizontal and surfaces with slightly larger horizontal errors. The conclusions drawn from such serious and strict experiments can stand the test of time anywhere.

          New Battle

    In the fourth quarter of 1964, after we completed the construction of the wheel and tire factory project, a large number of us transferred to new construction sites. During the transfer, workers and technicians cherishedly packed and transported the test pieces left for testing ten or twenty years later. Before we arrived at the new construction site, the vanguard team first carried out slag tests at the site. After the team transferred, a unit specializing in the production of slag was immediately organized, and it was used on a large scale in the project. By the end of the third quarter of 1965, more than 90,000 cubic meters of heavy slag had been used.
    Our work is still far from enough. There is still much work to be done to further and more widely use slag. For example, the production of slag is currently still using the method of drilling holes and blasting in the old slag dump. The new technology of using newly formed slag at that time has not yet been mastered, and this is the main measure to further reduce the production cost of slag and save space. We have not yet made a comprehensive scientific conclusion on whether slag can be used for concrete columns, crane beams, and roof frames in important factories. These all require further efforts to experiment and seek solutions.
    Chairman Mao's works such as *On Practice*, *On Contradiction*, *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, and *Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership* have guided our every action from beginning to end. In the future, we will continue to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the method of dividing one into two to summarize the past, treat the future, and continue to work hard and move forward.

    Beijing Slag Products Factory uses waste from the iron and steel industry—heavy slag—to make slag bricks. This kind of brick has high strength, good cold and heat insulation performance, and is suitable for general buildings. Using slag instead of clay to make bricks can save a lot of land, save money, and production is not affected by the season.

    坚持科学试验的胜利
    ——第一冶金建设公司大量利用矿渣代替天然石的经验
    第一冶金建设公司
    把高炉重矿渣当作建筑石料来利用呢？还是把它当作废物抛弃？这是在冶金工业生产和基本建设中长期以来有争论的问题。高炉重矿渣其实不过是天然石灰石和铁矿石中的岩石成分在高炉中熔化后再生的人造石，是一种完全可以利用的人造石料。但是，取得这样的认识却花费了比较长的时间。
      把废料变成有用材料
    一九六二年，当我们开始动工建设车轮轮箍厂的时候，由于当地的建筑石料仅能满足市政建设需要，车轮轮箍厂工程需要的建筑石料不得不从远地运来，最近的是一百多公里，最远的是五百多公里。由于运距远，装卸次数多，平均折算每立米石子运抵现场施工地点的单价高达二十五元。而当地钢铁厂的高炉重矿渣却堆积如山，占用不少场地；为了抛渣还修建了铁路，耗用不少人力和资金。
    我们决定试验用高炉重矿渣来作建筑石料。
    开始的时候，我们把堆积着的高炉重矿渣破碎、筛分成为重矿渣碎石，用来作耐热混凝土的石子。通过一系列试验，证明它的耐热性能完全符合要求。为了切实地保证工程质量，还作了比较谨慎的技术规定，对重矿渣中的不均匀成分（玻璃体和多孔体）的含量限制很严，甚至用大量人力进行手工挑选。
    重矿渣耐热混凝土在一些重要工程上的使用，又引起了我们很多设想：既然重矿渣能用于耐热混凝土，为什么不能用于无耐热要求的普通混凝土？重矿渣碎石和天然碎石（主要是石灰石和砂石）在一切技术性能方面到底有那些不同？在重矿渣碎石中，不均匀成分到底产生多大影响？是不是需要花那么多的人力挑选？
    这样，就开始了重矿渣碎石和石灰石碎石之间的一系列对比试验。试验的结果说明，两者之间的技术性能有很多是相近似的。其中主要的一个性能——抗压强度，二者都在每平方厘米三百至一千四百公斤范围内，有的重矿渣每平方厘米高达二千五百公斤，因此，都能满足普通混凝土对石子强度的需要。重矿渣碎石中的不均匀成分，由于实际含量只占总数的百分之二十，在混凝土里所造成的影响极微小，因此手工挑选这道工序并不需要。
    在这个基础上，用重矿渣碎石代替石灰石碎石的工作得到了开展，先是在次要的工程结构上试用，逐步地在重要的工程结构上也进行了试验。由于减少了手工挑选这道工序，按一定规格生产出来的重矿渣碎石单价降低至每立米九元；不讲究规格的重矿渣，每立米二元多。这比每立米石子单价二十五元，经济得多。
    在试验逐步成功的基础上，逐步扩大使用范围，并对各种技术要求都作了尽可能明确的规定，从而使推广工作一开始就放在确保质量的基础之上。
    经过这一系列的工作，矿渣在混凝土方面的应用范围从厂房垫层扩大到柱基、渠道、梁、板、烟囱、普通设备基础、重要设备基础、民用建筑的各个部位。除了混凝土屋架、柱子、吊车梁这些重要的结构，由于缺乏疲劳强度等试验数据（这些数据在我公司条件下不能取得，只有在研究院的设备仪器条件下才能完成），而没有推广以外，矿渣差不多占领了原来石灰石所占有的全部阵地。
          三　场　争　论
    矿渣在混凝土方面既然能得到日益广泛的运用，那末，在公路上能不能应用呢？铁路上能不能应用呢？地基上能不能应用呢？既然日益证明它和天然石灰石的物理化学性能有很多相似的地方，那末在一切过去用石灰石碎石的地方，能不能全以矿渣来代替呢？
    一九六三年的夏天，整个环厂公路就要动工了，按照原来设计的图纸，这些公路的路基和路面，是由天然碎石构成的。但是，我们从施工准备阶段开始，就把施工用的临时公路建筑在正式公路的位置上，临时公路的路基全部利用的是矿渣。这样就出现了一个问题：是把已经经过一年至两年时间，天天由繁忙的载重运输汽车（行车最高达每昼夜一千七百辆次）反复辗压的矿渣层挖掉，换上从几百公里以外运来的石灰石层呢？还是充分利用这个基层呢？根据在混凝土中使用的情况来看，利用矿渣是有把握的，但是由于具体设计的人员不在施工现场，无法取得一致的意见，而信件上的答复则要求挖掉矿渣重换石灰石。为了统一思想认识，针对着所提出的怀疑问题，逐项地进行了试验，特别是在公路上实地进行了载荷试验。试验的结果证明，公路运行时间越长，路面强度越高，行车一年半的达到设计需要值的四倍，行车两年的达到六倍。同时，在试验中也解决了矿渣路基和路面的耐久性、耐磨性、排水性等问题。于是，矿渣在整个厂区公路中得到了广泛的推广。
    铁路为什么非得从几百公里以外运来石灰石碎石作道床呢？矿渣碎石为什么不能用呢？原来做铁路设计的技术人员还有很多担心之处。耐磨怎样？抗冲击怎样？排水怎样？吸水怎样？会不会影响钢轨机件腐蚀？对机车运行能否承受得住等等。
    解决这些分歧意见也只有通过试验，除了室内试验以外，还进行了一定长度（一百多米长一段线）的实际试铺。经过试验，经过实践，证明用矿渣碎石作铁路道床，可以得到很好的质量，而且是节约的。于是，矿渣作铁路道床，逐渐地从三级线二级线一直用到一级线。
    第三场争论发生在一九六四年，当混凝土里用矿渣代替石灰石已经取得了两年的经验，似乎一切都已经很顺利的时候，在车轮轮箍厂的另一部分工程上，由于调换了一个设计院，新的问题又发生了。对矿渣的怀疑是一连串的：矿渣在混凝土里日久以后会继续分解！矿渣会腐蚀钢筋（矿渣的不均匀性不能保证质量）！矿渣对于薄壁混凝土构件容易造成裂缝！直至担心到：用矿渣混凝土建造的楼房会在若干年后倒坍，把第二代压死！因此坚决不同意在这个工程上使用。当时，我们中间有的同志说：“反正工程数量不多了，省不了多少钱了，犯不着为此斤斤计较，不用就不用算了吧！”但是，大多数人没有同意这种说法，认为：新的设计单位重复地提出已经解决了的问题，这种现象并不奇怪。因为他们不了解、不熟悉，心里没有底。在这种时候，我们应该帮助他们了解，熟悉，做到心里有底，使他们不再担心害怕，使他们从一个矿渣利用的怀疑者，转变成为一个矿渣利用的积极支持者。如果随便放弃这一工作，那就是对革命事业不负责任，不仅造成浪费，而且等于使过去使用了十几万立米矿渣的工程，都打上一个问号。正好在这段时间里，《人民日报》发表了《棉田里的一场革命》一文和《热情扶植新事物的幼芽》的社论。我们结合学习毛主席著作，组织学习了这两篇文章。大家一致要求把利用矿渣这样的新生事物坚持扶植到底。
    为了帮助这个设计单位，消除每一个技术上的怀疑，我们一面指派了技术处长带着全部的试验资料，专门前去作详细的介绍，一面又举办了一个矿渣展览会，展出了二十多幅图表，四十多组试件和实物。并且陪同他们参观了如何在薄壁结构上消除裂缝的措施。经过这一系列的工作，这个设计单位从反对利用矿渣变为积极支持利用矿渣了。
    经过这三场争论，我们体会到，任何一样新生事物在它的发展过程中，都不会是一帆风顺的。多少次的起伏是不可避免的。只要坚持科学试验，坚持党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，坚持耐心的说服态度，达到统一认识，才能把事情办好。
          群众性大试验
    矿渣从开始只用在很小的部位、很少的数量，逐渐发展成为建筑工地上的主要建筑石料，这中间，群众性的大试验，起了很大的作用。
    这次群众性试验的一个特点，是带着问题做试验。无论是从设计角度，使用角度或者是施工角度，凡是提出怀疑就做试验，前前后后做了四十三个项目、二千六百多组试件。我们觉得不管人家提的问题如何，凡是有怀疑就应该有答案，对一切问题都必须追根究底，弄个水落石出。例如有人提出铁路上用矿渣排水性可能不好，又提出矿渣吸水性大，会影响路基土翻浆冒泥。这些问题看来好象不大，而且也没有标准的试验方法。我们就自己想出了试验方法，从实地试铺线路上取样筛分，测定含泥量，测定路基含水率，回答了这两个问题，说明矿渣的排水性是良好的，吸水性虽然大些，但只大百分之一点五到百分之三，不会影响路基土翻浆冒泥，这就使担心的人放了心。
    试验的另一个特点是和实际调查相结合，一方面在试验室里做，一方面在不重要的部位或者临时工程上试，并实地调查几年以前的工程。例如矿渣在混凝土里会不会分解？钢筋在矿渣混凝土里会不会生锈？在试验室里做的试验尽管很明确，但有些人还担心几年以后、几十年以后到底怎么样？我们前后调查了二十多个实地工程，有一年以前的直到六年以前的。它的共同规律是；凡是包在混凝土里的都没有锈，凡是因混凝土被撞掉，钢筋裸露在大气中的都锈得非常快。可见锈蚀钢筋的是空气和水，而不是矿渣混凝土。而所有的矿渣混凝土没有一个有分解现象的。这就打消了使用部门的怀疑。
    试验还有一个特点是上下左右一起搞试验，工人、技术人员和领导干部一起搞试验。不仅建设公司的中心试验室和各工程公司的试验室作试验，而且工地、加工厂也在作试验。中心试验室打破了过去的旧框框，全室的各个专业试验组一起动手作试验，从而对过去许多悬而未决的问题做了答案。因为科学是相互联系的，仅仅依靠一个专业组是回答不了问题的。
    试验还有一个特点是严肃对待、严格要求，并且采取了集中力量打歼灭战的办法，不得结果誓不罢休。对矿渣的试验在一九六四年以前已经做了一千五百多组试件，回答了大部分的问题。但是有些试验还比较粗糙。为了对车轮轮箍工程高度负责，对党和国家负责，使这项经验得到进一步推广，我们坚持在一九六四年内又补做了一千一百多组试件，甚至留出了十年、二十年以后的试件。在反复试验中，可以看出严和不严差别很大。例如用矿渣加工磨光成立方体做强度试验，表面水平的和表面水平度误差稍大的，在压力机下压碎时的读数能相差百分之三十左右。经过这样严肃、严格的试验得出的结论，拿到那里都站得住脚了。
          新　的　战　斗
    一九六四年四季度，我们完成了车轮轮箍厂工程建设以后，大批地转移到新的建设工地。在转移的时候，工人和技术人员把留在十年、二十年以后作试验的试件珍惜地装运带走。当我们到达新的建设工地之前，先由前哨队伍展开该地的矿渣试验，队伍转移以后，立即组织了专门生产矿渣的单位，在工程上大面积地利用。到一九六五年三季度末，已经利用重矿渣九万多立米。
    我们的工作做得还很不够，要进一步更广泛地利用矿渣，还有许多工作要做。例如，矿渣的生产，目前还是采用在旧矿渣堆场里打眼放炮开采的方法，如何把新形成的矿渣当时利用的新技术，现在还没有掌握，而这是进一步降低矿渣生产成本、节约场地的主要措施。我们对于矿渣能否用于重要厂房的混凝土柱、吊车梁、房架等问题，也还没有作出全面的科学结论。这些，都需要进一步努力试验，求得解决。
    毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》等著作，自始至终指导着我们的每一个行动。今后，我们还要遵循毛主席的教导，用一分为二的方法，总结过去，对待将来，不断努力，不断前进。（附图片）
