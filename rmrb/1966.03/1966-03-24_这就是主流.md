    The upheaval in Latin America is intensifying. The tides of national democratic revolutionary movements rise and fall. It is just like the saying, "If the East doesn't shine, the West does; if the South is dark, the North is bright." Today, throughout the entire continent, there is hardly a safe haven for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The surging anti-U.S. revolutionary struggle of the people of various countries is the mainstream of the Latin American situation; this mainstream cannot be stopped by any force. The revolutionary banner of the Latin American people cannot be overthrown by anyone.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out more than a decade ago: "Imperialism is driving the great masses of people throughout the world into the historical era of undertaking the great struggle to eliminate imperialism." The people of Latin American countries are precisely being driven by U.S. imperialism onto the road of struggle to eliminate it and its lackeys. The situation in the Dominican Republic is such, the situation in Colombia is such, and the situation in many other countries is the same. Moreover, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are intensifying their perverse actions, fueling the rising tide of anti-U.S. revolutionary struggle in Latin America.
    At present, the ways in which the Latin American people are carrying out the anti-U.S. struggle are diverse, including armed struggle, political struggle, and economic struggle. However, they all reflect the growing awakening of the broad masses of people and the continuous expansion and strengthening of revolutionary forces in Latin American countries. At the same time, because all these struggles are directed against a common enemy, they naturally play a role of mutual support, mutual echo, and mutual coordination. A broad anti-U.S. united front is gradually forming and expanding throughout Latin America. This is precisely why U.S. imperialism is struggling to cope.
    Today's situation in Latin America is indeed, as many American bourgeois newspapers have said, like a volcano about to erupt. These volcanoes are bound to erupt sooner or later. Can't people already hear the sound of the churning magma, or see the smoke billowing from the craters?

    这就是主流
    拉丁美洲的大动荡有增无已。民族民主革命运动的浪潮此伏彼起。正是所谓“东方不亮西方亮，黑了南方有北方。”今天，在整个大陆，几乎没有一处是美帝国主义和它的走狗的安乐土了。各国人民反美革命斗争汹涌澎湃地向前发展，是拉丁美洲形势中的主流；这一主流，是任何力量阻挡不了的。拉丁美洲人民的革命旗帜，是任何人都不能把它推倒的。
    毛泽东同志在十多年前就已指出：“帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”拉丁美洲各国人民，正是被美帝国主义驱向消灭它和它的走狗的斗争道路的。多米尼加的情况是如此，哥伦比亚的情况是如此，其他许许多多国家的情况同样是如此。而且，美帝国主义和它的走狗正在以变本加厉的倒行逆施来推波助澜，使拉丁美洲的反美革命斗争浪潮越来越高涨。
    目前，拉丁美洲人民进行反美斗争的方式是多种多样的，有武装斗争，有政治斗争，有经济斗争。但是，它们都反映了在拉丁美洲各国中广大人民正在日益觉醒，革命力量正在不断扩大和加强。同时，由于所有这些斗争都是针对着共同的敌人，它们就自然而然地起着互相支援、互相呼应、互相配合的作用。一个广泛的反美统一战线正在全拉丁美洲逐步形成和扩大。美帝国主义之所以穷于应付，也正是这个缘故。
    拉丁美洲今天的形势，的确象许多美国资产阶级报刊所说的那样，到处是熔岩欲喷的火山。这些火山是迟早要爆发的。人们不是已经可以听见那些岩浆翻腾的声音，或者看到从那些火山口冒出的浓烟了吗？
