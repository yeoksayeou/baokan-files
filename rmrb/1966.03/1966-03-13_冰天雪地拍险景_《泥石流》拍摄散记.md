    Filming Perilous Scenes in Icy and Snowy Conditions
    ——Filming Notes on "Mudflow"
    Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio　Yin Hong

    In April 1965, the leadership assigned us a glorious task: to go to Tibet, our motherland, to film a color science education film – "Mudflow."
      "Mudflow" is a special flood containing a large amount of mud, sand, and rocks. It erupts suddenly, possesses enormous destructive power, and is a natural disaster that must be paid attention to in mountainous construction. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant departments of the Tibet Autonomous Region organized a comprehensive team including geology, geomorphology, hydrology, meteorology, glaciers, botany, and stereoscopic photogrammetry to conduct on-site investigations of "mudflows." We three film workers worked together with this scientific expedition team.

    In late April, we entered the foot of a mountain with a dense forest, with a clear lake on one side and a vast "sea of stones" on the other. The car stopped, and the expedition captain shouted: "Comrades! Get out of the car, our base camp has arrived." After getting out of the car, we immediately plunged into battle – setting up tents, removing weeds, and cutting down wood to build the kitchen. After setting up camp, we began a series of activities with the expedition members.

    One early morning, we walked towards the "sea of stones" facing the sun. This "sea of stones" is formed by the accumulation of mud and rock mixed torrents. Some of the stones here are as large as houses, weighing thousands of tons, and the most common ones also weigh tens of tons. One piece connected to another, one pile connected to another, undulating like ocean waves, truly a "sea of stones" in name and in fact.

    The three of us in the film crew were divided into two groups. When departing, in addition to the camera, battery, and tripod, each person had to wear a storm suit, carry a down sleeping bag, ice axe, long rubber boots, raincoat, and a short gun (mainly to deal with wild animals), as well as Chairman Mao's works and necessary study materials. In addition, each person had to bring enough dry food and drinking water. These things added up to twenty kilograms, and all were essential.

    Arriving at Base Camp No. 1, it was already a 4,000-meter-high mountain, but the surrounding snow-capped mountains were exceptionally steep, facing a 6,000-meter-high snow mountain, and the sound of rumbling constantly echoed all around. Sometimes, with a loud roar, a white cloud of smoke rushed into the air. The expedition members said that this was a "snow avalanche."

    At night, some people said that high-altitude hypoxia makes people easily excited and difficult to fall asleep. No matter how hard I tried to sleep, I just couldn't fall asleep. Suddenly, it started pouring rain. The rain was very heavy. In order to cooperate with Comrade Xu Feng in concentrating on capturing a batch of mudflow movement shots outside the valley, we decided to go down the mountain in the rain.

    In the vast rain and fog, Xiao Pan and I couldn't find the road signs. Suddenly, I remembered seeing a snow avalanche gully down the mountain on a clear day, which was facing the highway. In the snow avalanche gully, due to the convergence of rainwater, some stones were washed and rolled around, and it was dangerous to go down from here. What should we do? We discussed and decided that I would walk in front, exploring the slope as I went; Xiao Pan would listen for the sound of rolling rocks from behind. In this way, one in front and one behind, we explored our way down the slope. Following the steeper snow avalanche gully, we walked and slid down more than half the way, suddenly discovering a very steep cliff. After careful inspection, there were protruding coking stones and recessed cracks on the cliff. We were like a pair of geckos, stepping on coking stones, stepping on cracks, climbing branches, slowly descending step by step. At this time, although our stomachs were a little hungry and our hands were pierced, hunger and pain forced us to stay awake, not to lose our grip, not to slip. When we safely returned to the base camp, we were soaked through and looked like a pair of mud men crawling out of a mud pond.

    After the heavy rain, the mudflow still did not erupt. During this long period, the valley was calm, and the wind and rain had stopped. The party group of the expedition team decided to use this time to study Chairman Mao's works and further arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. During the day, everyone engaged in intense exploration work, and at night, candles were lit in each tent and everyone gathered together, combining the actual situation of the exploration, to discuss what the main contradictions forming mudflows were, and so on. The three of us in the film crew also participated in this upsurge of study. After the discussion, we climbed the mountain again. This time, the climb would pass Base Camp No. 1, Base Camp No. 2, and go to the icy and snowy Base Camp No. 3 to meet the comrades of the glacier group, preparing to film the main shots of "snow avalanches" and collapses in the mudflow formation area, as well as ice melting. Comrade Xu Feng still stayed in the valley with the hydrological team's exploration members, waiting in full battle array.

    In July, when the inland areas of the motherland were experiencing scorching heat, Base Camp No. 3, where the expedition team was located, was covered in ice and snow. Base Camp No. 3 was built under a 6,200-meter-high snow mountain. The expedition members observed and studied high-altitude climate, glacier melting, and "snow avalanches" and other scientific projects here day and night.

    The weather here is fickle. During the day, it is a fine day, and at night, a strong wind accompanies goose feather snow, flying and dancing. The day after the snow, we got up early in the morning and went to find a location to film "snow avalanches" facing the rising sun. Under the guidance and help of the comrades of the expedition team, we came to a slightly gentle place and stopped. Looking around, thousands of peaks and ridges were layered upon layer. Sometimes, suddenly hearing a boom, a snow avalanche occurred on the mountain peak in front, but by the time you aimed accurately, it was already nearing its end. How can we accurately capture this snow avalanche scene that occurs and disappears in an instant? How can we film a complete snow avalanche process? Xiao Pan and I sat on the moraine stones and observed the site for a long time. Suddenly, I thought of the scene of the People's Liberation Army operating anti-aircraft guns to shoot down airplanes. We discussed it and started practicing: first, one person, like a gunner, stared at the camera's viewfinder, right hand holding the camera's direction control lever, left hand on the motor switch, ready to shoot at any time, and the other person, like a commander, numbered the snow peaks and snow avalanche gullies within sight one by one. When the commander shouted number one or several, the person filming quickly aimed the camera lens at the mountain peak of that number. In this way, the two of us took turns commanding and taking turns operating the camera, practicing repeatedly, truly achieving speed and accuracy, shooting wherever pointed. However, one day, two days, many days passed, and there was no large snow avalanche. We had to wait. Sometimes, while eating, our eyes were still fixed on the camera. Finally, at more than four o'clock in the afternoon on July 28, the ideal shot was waiting for us. A "snow avalanche" suddenly erupted on "Maiden Peak" at an altitude of more than 6,000 meters, and tens of meters of accumulated snow collapsed. Suddenly, plumes of thick white mushroom-shaped snow clouds rose in the snow avalanche gully. Foreign glacier scholars call such a huge snow avalanche the "white death," but this "death" was finally caught by us.

    The entire mudflow formation area is a basin surrounded by mountains. A large pile of mud, sand, and rocks accumulates in the basin. These accumulations are very loose, and some people call them ancient moraines. They sleep in the valley, and when there is abundant water, they cause a mudflow natural disaster. One day after a heavy rain, we went to the slope above the ditch to film the collapse. In advance, the comrades of the expedition team used ropes to tie Xiao Pan and me around our waists and tied them to a large rock far away from the ditch slope. In this way, standing on the edge of the ditch to film the collapse, in case the place where we were standing also collapsed, we wouldn't fall to the bottom of the ditch.

    After we were all prepared, before long, the place that had been selected collapsed. We filmed it one by one into the lens. Just as I was concentrating on filming, I didn't know that the place where I was standing also began to collapse downward. When Xiao Pan saw that the front legs of the tripod had begun to sink, he leaped over, picked up the camera, and jumped backward. In an instant, the place where I had been standing collapsed with a bang, with a pile of mud, sand, and rocks collapsing downward. However, we had already recorded the collapsing scene.

    One by one, most of the shots have been crossed off the filming plan. The main content that remains unshot is only the shot of the mudflow flowing.

    From the time we arrived at Base Camp No. 2, we went to the edge of the main gully where mudflows erupt almost every day to wait for the mudflow movement shots. However, the selected filming location was more than two hundred meters away from the eruption point, with the main gully and a steep cliff in between, making it impossible to cross. The scenery was far away, and it was difficult to get close, making long-distance filming likely to cause the picture (scenery) to be blurred. "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs?" We decided to go down to the main gully to take close-up shots. Xiao Pan said: "Going down to the main gully, although very difficult, is much easier than the Vietnamese people fighting against American imperialism on the battlefield. I am a young person and have not yet joined the Communist Youth League. I will definitely use my actions to create the conditions for joining the League." That night, we told the team leaders about this determination. The captain said: "Going down to the main gully is not just a matter of going deep into the tiger's den to catch tiger cubs, but of pulling teeth from a tiger's mouth! This matter needs to be studied."

    In order to ensure safety, the Tibet Highway Engineering Office used explosives to blast a gently sloping section on the wall of the main gully for us, creating a gentle slope that could be pulled down to the bottom of the gully with ropes. We went down the gully with the comrades of the expedition team. We held onto the ropes, tied ropes around our waists, stepped on the walls of the gully, and went down bit by bit. After reaching the bottom of the gully, we carefully walked forward for a while, but the captain shouted for us to stop before we had gone far. He said that next time, we would find a comrade to stand guard upstream of the gully. If they saw a mudflow erupting upstream of the main gully, they would fire a gun to warn us to avoid it in time, to prevent danger. The next day, we followed the captain's advice and set up "sentries" in the gully to monitor the movements upstream of the main gully. We and some of the expedition members, carrying cameras, went down to the main gully again to find a suitable and safe place to wait for the mudflow to come.

    In recent days, the climate has been changing: frequent rainfall, rising temperatures, a lot of glacial meltwater, and more collapses upstream, making the possibility of mudflows erupting greater and greater. One day in mid-August, the three of us (at this time, Comrade Xu Feng was also transferred up) went down to the main gully with the expedition team as usual. Before we had entered the position where we had waited to shoot before, we had already seen a torrent far away, carrying mud, sand, and rocks forward and backward, floating huge rocks, flooding. A burst of thunderous roars also sounded in the gully. We ran to a safe high ground, quickly prepared, faced the head of the mudflow, turned on the camera switch, and let the camera rotate rhythmically. After shooting one shot, another head roared and rolled in, countless giant rocks and mud and sand poured over in front of us, the camera made a rustling sound, we held the machine tightly, and recorded this natural phenomenon that we had long hoped would come.

    冰天雪地拍险景
    ——《泥石流》拍摄散记
    上海科学教育电影制片厂　殷虹
    一九六五年四月，领导上交给我们一个光荣的任务：到祖国的西藏拍摄一部彩色科学教育影片——《泥石流》。
      “泥石流”是一种饱含大量泥沙石块的特殊洪流，它突然爆发，具有极大的破坏力，是山区建设中必须注意的一种自然灾害。中国科学院和西藏自治区有关部门，组织了一支包括地质、地貌、水文、气象、冰川、植物和立体摄影测量等综合性的队伍，深入现场进行“泥石流”的考察。我们三个电影工作者，就和这支科学考察队伍一起工作。
    四月下旬，我们进到一个茂密森林的山脚下，一边是清澈的湖泊，一边是一片浩瀚的“石海”。车停下来了，考察队长喊道：“同志们！下车啦，咱们的大本营到了。”下车后，我们立即投入了战斗——搭帐篷，铲除杂草，砍伐木材修造伙房。建起营地，我们随着考察队员开始了一系列的活动。
    一天清晨，我们迎着阳光向“石海”走去。这个“石海”就是泥石混杂的洪流停积时形成的。这里的石头，有的象房子那样大，上千吨重，最普通的也有数十吨重。一块连着一块，一堆连着一堆，如同大海波浪一样起伏不平，真是名副其实的“石海”。
    我们摄制队三个人，分成两组。在出发时，每人除摄影机、电瓶和三角架外，还要穿上冲峰衣，背上鸭绒睡袋、冰镐、长筒胶鞋、雨衣和一支短枪（主要对付野兽），还有毛主席著作和必要的学习文件。另外，吃的干粮和饮水每人更要带足。这些东西加起来有二十公斤，都是必不可少的。
    到达一号宿营地，这里已是四千米的高山，但四周环绕的雪山异常峻峭，迎面是六千多米高的雪山，四面不断地响起轰轰隆隆的声音。有时随着一声大的轰鸣声，一片白色的烟云冲向空中，考察队员说这就是“雪崩”。
    到了夜晚，有人说高山缺氧，人容易兴奋不易睡着，我怎样努力想睡，可就是睡不着。忽然下起瓢泼大雨来，雨下得很大，为了配合徐风同志在山谷外集中抢拍一批泥石流的流动镜头，我们决定冒雨下山。
    在茫茫的雨雾中，我和小潘找不到路标了。忽然想起晴天在山下看到有个雪崩槽，是朝公路方向的。雪崩槽中，由于雨水的汇集，有些石头被水冲得乱滚，从这里往下走是危险的。怎么办呢？我们商量好，决定我在前边走，一边走一边探着坡路；小潘在后边注意听乱石滚下的声音。就这样我们一前一后，探索着顺坡而下。随着坡度较大的雪崩槽，连走带滑地下到一大半，突然发现一段非常陡峭的悬崖。经过仔细查看，悬崖上有突出的焦石和凹陷的缝隙。我们就象一对壁虎一样，踏焦石，踩缝隙，攀枝杈，一步一步慢慢而下。这时，虽然肚子也有些饿了，手也被刺破了，但是，饥饿和刺痛更迫使我们清醒，别失手，别脱脚。当我们安全回到大本营时，浑身淋得透湿，活象一对从泥塘里爬出来的泥人。
    大雨之后，泥石流仍然没有爆发，这一段长时间，山谷是平静的，风与雨都停息了。考察队党小组决定，利用这段时间学习毛主席著作，进一步把我们的头脑用毛泽东思想武装起来。白天大家从事紧张的考察工作，晚上各个帐篷里点起了蜡烛围在一起，结合考察实际情况，讨论什么是形成泥石流的主要矛盾等问题。我们电影组三个人，也参加到这场学习热潮中。讨论以后，我们再次登山。这次登山要经过一号营地、二号营地，到冰天雪地的三号营地去和冰川组同志汇合，准备拍摄泥石流形成区“雪崩”和崩塌以及冰融化等主要镜头。徐风同志仍然和水文组的考察队员坚守山谷，严阵以待。
    七月，在祖国内地正是炎炎酷暑的时候，可是考察队所在的三号营地，却是冰天雪地。三号营地就建在海拔六千二百多米的雪山下。考察队员就在这里日日夜夜，对高山气候、冰川融化和“雪崩”等科学项目进行观察研究。
    这里天气变化无常，白天是大好晴天，夜晚大风伴着鹅毛大雪，飘扬飞舞起来。下雪后的第二天，我们一早就起来，迎着朝阳去找拍“雪崩”的地位。我们在考察队同志的指导帮助下，来到一个稍微平缓的地方停下来，环视四周，千峰万岭，层层叠叠。有时突然听到轰一声，在前面的山峰上发生雪崩了，但等你看准了地方，那里已是接近尾声了。如何才能准确地抓到这种瞬间发生、瞬间又消失的雪崩景象呢？怎样才能拍摄一个完整的雪崩过程呢？我和小潘坐在冰碛石上，对现场观察了很长时间。忽然想起人民解放军操纵高射炮打飞机的情景，我们商量了一下，就开始演习起来：先由一人象炮手一样紧盯着摄影机的取景框，右手扶着摄影机的方向操作杆，左手按在马达开关上，随时准备拍摄，另一个人象指挥员一样，把视线内的雪峰、雪崩槽一一编上号码，当指挥员喊到一号或几号时，拍摄的人听着口令，就迅速地把机器镜头对准在该号的那个山峰上。就是这样，我俩轮流指挥，轮流操纵摄影机，反复练习，真正做到迅速准确，指那拍那。可是，一天，两天，很多天过去了，没有大雪崩，我们只好等下去。有时一边吃东西，眼睛还是盯在机器上。终于在七月二十八日的下午四点多钟，理想的镜头被我们等到了。海拔六千多米的“少女峰”上突然爆发了“雪崩”，几十米厚的积雪崩塌下来了。顿时在雪崩槽上升起一股股浓白色的蘑菇状雪云。象这样巨大的雪崩，外国冰川学者称它是“白色死神”，但这个“死神”终于被我们捉住了。
    在泥石流整个形成区里，是一个四面环山的盆地，盆地里堆积了一大堆泥沙石块，这些堆积物非常松散，有人叫它古冰碛物。它们睡在山谷里，逢到水源充沛时，就造成了一场泥石流的自然灾害。有一天大雨之后，我们到沟坡上面去拍崩塌。事先考察队同志用绳子把我和小潘从腰上捆好，拴在离沟坡较远的一块大石头上，这样站在沟边拍崩塌，万一站的地方也崩塌了，就不致于落到沟底去。
    当我们一切都准备停当之后，没过多久，果然被选中的地方，发生了崩塌。我们把它一一拍入镜头。正当我全神贯注地进行拍摄时，那知自己立脚的地方也开始往下面崩塌了。小潘一看三角架的前脚架已经开始往下陷塌了，就一个箭步窜过来，抱起机器就往后纵跳。刹那间，前边站的那块地方，轰的一声，一片泥沙石块崩塌下去了。可是，崩塌的景象我们已经纪录下来了。
    一个一个的镜头，大部分都从拍摄计划上涂去了。剩下来的没有拍的主要内容，只有泥石流流动的镜头了。
    从来到二号营地起，几乎每天都到泥石流爆发的主沟边去等拍泥石流流动的镜头。但是，选定的拍摄位置离爆发点有二百多米远，中间横隔主沟和一段陡崖，根本过不去。景物远，接近困难，做远距离拍摄，很有可能造成画面（景物）虚晃。“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，我们决定下主沟去拍近景镜头。小潘说：“下主沟，虽然很困难，但比起越南人民在战场上抗击美帝国主义要容易得多了。我是青年，还没有加入共青团，我一定用自己的行动创造入团条件。”当晚我们就把这个决心向队领导谈了。队长说：“下主沟，这不仅是深入虎穴捉虎子的问题，而是虎口拔牙呀！这件事还要经过研究才行。”
    为了保证安全，西藏公路工程处用炸药在主沟壁上替我们炸开一段缓平的坡度，开出了能用绳索拉着下到沟底的缓坡。我们和考察队同志一起下沟。我们手拉着绳索，腰上也捆上绳子，脚蹬着沟壁，往下一点一点地下。下到沟底，我们小心地往前走了一阵，但走了不远队长就喊我们停下。他说下次找个同志在沟的上游放哨，如果看到主沟上游爆发泥石流就鸣枪，及时躲避，以免发生危险。第二天我们按照队长的意见在沟上布置了“哨兵”，监视主沟上游的动静。我们和一部分考察队员带着摄影机，再次下到主沟，找一个合适而安全的地方，等待泥石流冲来。
    几天来气候变化的情况是：降雨频繁，气温升高，冰川融水很多，上游崩塌也多起来，爆发泥石流的可能性越来越大。在八月中旬的一天，我们三人（这时，徐风同志也调上来了）照例和考察队一起又下到主沟，我们还没有进入前几次等拍的阵地时，已看到远远的一股洪流，挟带着泥沙石块前推后拥，浮托着巨大的石块，泛滥而来。沟里也响起一阵阵雷鸣般的巨响。我们跑到一块安全的高岗上，迅速地准备停当，迎着泥石流的龙头，掀开摄影机开关，让摄影机有节奏地转动着。拍完一个镜头后，紧接着又有一股龙头咆哮着滚滚而来，无数的巨石和泥沙，涌过我们前面，摄影机发出沙沙的声音，我们紧握着机器，把这一场早就盼望它到来的自然现象，一一纪录下来。（附图片）
