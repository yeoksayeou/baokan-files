The Chinese Pavilion at the Leipzig Spring Trade Fair closed on March 15. During the 10-day exhibition, the Chinese Pavilion received approximately 680,000 visitors from the German Democratic Republic and other countries, who welcomed and praised it enthusiastically.

The Chinese Pavilion attracted a large number of visitors every day. A 70-year-old man told the Chinese staff that doctors had told him his eyesight was failing, and he decided to come and see the Chinese Pavilion while he still could. A 70-year-old woman from Dresden wrote a letter to the Chinese Pavilion after visiting it, expressing her feelings. She wrote in the letter, "In the Chinese Pavilion, I looked and looked, and couldn't get enough. The surging crowds show how much interest the audience has in the Chinese Pavilion. The audience is captivated by one exhibit after another, praising it endlessly..."

The great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and construction were highly praised by the visitors. Many people left messages in the Chinese Pavilion's guestbook or visited the Chinese Pavilion's staff to express their feelings. Many visitors from the German Democratic Republic expressed their praise for China with the following words: "The Chinese Pavilion shows the superiority of the socialist system"; "The policy of self-reliance has enabled China to achieve greater development"; "In just a few years, China has developed to this level, truly achieving a great leap forward"; "China's rapid development is proven every year, only fools would deny this"; "The Chinese Pavilion is brilliant and convincing, we hope to be friends with the Chinese people"; "Some people spread rumors that China is warlike, I don't believe it," and so on.

The foreign language editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on display in the exhibition hall particularly attracted the attention of the visitors. Many visitors gathered in front of the glass display case of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Many visitors asked the Chinese staff for "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Mao Zedong badges, and expressed their admiration for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. They said: "Mao Zedong's path is correct"; "China is great, the Chinese revolution is great, the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China is correct"; "The Communist Party of China is a true Marxist-Leninist party." An old worker, after wearing the Mao Zedong badge given to him, excitedly said: "Mao Zedong is the greatest person, wearing the Mao Zedong badge is better than wearing any other medal." Another visitor visited the Chinese Pavilion twice and told the Chinese staff: "Opposing China is a sin. I believe Mao Zedong will always be a revolutionary." When saying goodbye, he held the Chinese staff's hand tightly and said: "Please convey my greetings to Comrade Mao Zedong and wish him good health."

Some visitors from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had friendly conversations with the Chinese, praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Some wrote in the guestbook: "Long live Marxism-Leninism and its greatest and most glorious leader, Mao Zedong!"

Some visitors from Asian and African countries expressed their desire to read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They told the Chinese that "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is as important as bread; the path taken by the Chinese is the best path; we love Mao Zedong. We are fighting for national independence and need the works of Mao Zedong.

    来比锡博览会中国馆受到数十万人欢迎和赞扬
    德保捷匈观众留言欢呼马列主义和毛泽东万岁
    亚非国家观众表示为了争取民族独立斗争需要毛泽东著作
    新华社柏林十七日电一九六六年来比锡春季博览会于十五日闭幕。在历时十天的展览期间，参加博览会的中国馆一共接待了约六十八万多德意志民主共和国和其他国家的观众，受到了热烈的欢迎和赞扬。
    中国馆每天都吸引着大量的观众。一位七十多岁的老人对中国工作人员说，医生告诉他，他的眼睛快失明了，他决定在眼睛还看得见的时候赶来参观中国馆。德累斯顿的一位七十岁的老太太参观中国馆回到家里后，特地给中国馆写了一封信表达她的心意。她在信中说，在中国馆，“我看了又看，简直看不够。潮水般的人群说明，观众对中国馆的兴趣多么强烈。观众一会儿对这个展品，一会儿对那个展品看得入迷，赞不绝口……”。
    中国人民在社会主义革命和建设中所取得的巨大成就，受到了观众的热烈赞扬。许多人在中国馆的留言簿上留了言，或者访问了中国馆的工作人员，表示他们的这种心情。德意志民主共和国的许多观众用下面的这些话来表达他们对中国的赞扬。中国馆“显示了社会主义制度的优越性”；“自力更生政策使中国取得了更大发展”；“中国在短短的十几年里，发展到这样的水平，的确实现了大跃进”；“中国的飞跃发展每年都有事实的证明，只有白痴才不承认这一点”；“中国馆光芒四射，令人信服，我们希望同中国人民友好”；“有人造谣说，中国好战，我不相信”，等等。
    在展览馆里展出的外文版《毛泽东选集》，特别引起观众的注意。在陈列《毛泽东选集》的玻璃柜前面，常常围着许多观众。许多观众向中国工作人员索要《毛泽东选集》和毛主席象纪念章，并且表示了他们对毛主席和中国共产党的敬佩心情。他们说：“毛泽东的道路是正确的”；“中国是伟大的，中国革命是伟大的，毛泽东和中国共产党的领导是正确的”；“中国共产党是真正的马克思列宁主义政党”。一位老工人佩戴上送给他的毛泽东象纪念章后激动地说：“毛泽东是最伟大的人，戴上毛泽东象纪念章，比戴上什么奖章都好”。另一位观众接连两次参观中国馆，他对中国工作人员说：“反对中国是一个罪恶。我相信毛泽东永远是革命者”。告别时，他紧握着中国工作人员的手说：“请转告毛泽东同志，我向他问好，祝他身体健康”。
    一些来自保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利等国的观众同中国人亲切交谈，赞扬毛主席和中国共产党。有的在留言簿上写道：“马克思列宁主义及其最伟大而光荣的领袖毛泽东万岁！”
    一些亚非国家的观众表示渴望读《毛泽东选集》，他们对中国人表示：《毛泽东选集》象面包一样重要，中国人走的道路是最好的道路；我们热爱毛泽东。我们进行争取民族独立斗争，需要毛泽东的著作。
