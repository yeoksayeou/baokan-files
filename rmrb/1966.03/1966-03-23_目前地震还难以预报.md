    Currently, Earthquake Prediction Is Still Difficult
    Zhen Gong
    After an earthquake occurs, people often ask: Can earthquakes be predicted?
    Modern science can already predict changes in the weather. Compared to weather forecasting, earthquake prediction is still in a very immature stage. Modern science has not yet grasped the laws governing the occurrence of earthquakes, and cannot know when an earthquake will occur in a certain place, let alone predict the epicenter, the exact time of occurrence, and the magnitude of the earthquake. This is primarily because earthquakes generally occur deep underground, and people have not yet designed an effective instrument to observe the conditions inside the earth at any time. Secondly, the recurrence rate of earthquakes is too small, and the cycle is too long, especially for destructive major earthquakes, some of which occur once a century, and others occur once a millennium in the same area. Therefore, people have few opportunities for practice, insufficient accumulation of data, making it difficult to make thorough statistics and conduct comparative analysis, and it is also not easy to verify theories and develop theories. Finally, modern seismology developed relatively late, and has not yet explored an effective way to solve the difficult problem of earthquake prediction.
    Despite this, we can still collect a lot of meaningful data on the occurrence of earthquakes to help us consider predicting earthquakes.
    (1) Based on historically recorded earthquake data, we can statistically analyze the number, magnitude, and time intervals of earthquakes that have occurred in various regions in the past. Combined with local geological conditions, we can estimate the maximum earthquake that may occur in the region in a certain period of time in the future (for example, one hundred years). This estimate of the trend of earthquake risk has certain reference value for the site selection of basic construction and the seismic design of buildings.
    (2) Geologically unstable areas often experience major earthquakes. In these areas, the crustal uplift and subsidence movements and horizontal movements are relatively intense, which can easily cause large-scale rock layer ruptures, leading to earthquakes. Some areas are located near large crustal fracture zones, and under the influence of new uplift and subsidence movements, new fractures and dislocations will also occur. Some areas have frequent seismic activity, but the intensity is not very large. Some areas appear to be very calm for a long time (for example, one or two hundred years), with very few small earthquakes occurring, but after a certain period of time, a relatively strong earthquake will occur. Therefore, studying the geological conditions and the characteristics of crustal movement in a region is of great significance for estimating the earthquake risk in that region and predicting future earthquakes. Since liberation, certain achievements have been made in this area of research.
    (3) If it is necessary to carry out basic construction in areas with greater earthquake risk, necessary seismic measures must be taken in the structural design and construction requirements of buildings.
    Earthquakes can certainly cause serious consequences, but destructive earthquakes do not occur frequently. For important buildings, on the one hand, it is necessary to take precautions, but at the same time, it is necessary to minimize the design standards to avoid overspending construction funds to defend against disasters that may not occur. For civil buildings, the focus should be on ensuring personal safety.
    Earthquake prediction is indeed a difficult problem, and the progress of current research is relatively slow. However, we firmly believe that the universe is knowable, and one day, earthquake prediction will be possible.

    目前地震还难以预报
    震工
    在发生了地震以后，人们常问：地震能够预报吗？
    现代科学已经能够预报气象的变化。比起天气预报来，地震预报还处于很不成熟的阶段。现代科学还没有掌握住地震发生的规律，还不能知道某些地方什么时候要发生地震，更不要说预报出地震的中心位置、地震发生的准确时刻和地震的强度大小了。这首先是因为地震一般发生在地下深处，人们还没有设计出一种有效的仪器来随时观察地内的情况。其次，地震发生的重复率太小，周期太长，特别是具有破坏性的大地震，有的是百年一遇，也有的对同一地区来说是千年一遇，因而人们的实践机会少，资料积累不够丰富，难于作出周密的统计和进行分析比较，也不容易验证理论、发展理论。最后，现代地震学发展得比较晚，对于解决地震预报这个难题还没有探索出一条有效的途径。
    尽管如此，目前我们对地震的发生仍然可以收集许多有意义的资料，来帮助我们考虑预报地震。
    （1）根据历史记载的地震资料，我们可以统计历史上各地区发生地震的次数、大小和时间间隔，结合当地的地质条件，就可以估计在未来的一定时期（例如一百年）内，该地区可能发生的最大地震有多大。这种对地震危险性趋势的估计，对基本建设的选址和建筑物的设防，有一定参考价值。
      （2）地质构造不稳定的地区常发生大地震。这类地区的地壳升降运动和水平运动比较强烈，容易造成大规模的岩层破裂，从而导致地震。有的地区处于大的地壳断裂带附近，在新的升降运动的影响下，还会产生新的断裂和错动。有的地区地震活动频繁，但强度不十分大。有的地区在长时间（例如一二百年）内看来很平静，小地震很少发生，但在一定时期后，会发生一次比较强烈的地震。因此，研究一个地区的地质情况和地壳运动的特点，对估计这个地区的地震危险性和预测未来发生的地震有重要意义。解放以来，这方面的研究取得了一定的成果。
    （3）如果有必要在地震危险性较大的地区进行基本建设，就必须在建筑结构上和施工要求上采取必要的抗震措施。
    地震固然能造成严重后果，但破坏性地震并不经常发生。对于重要的建筑物，一方面不得不设防，同时又必须尽量降低设防标准，以免为了防御不一定会遭受的灾害，过多地占用建设资金。对于民用建筑，重点则应放在保证人身安全上。
    地震预报确是一个难题，目前的研究进展比较慢。但是，我们坚信宇宙是可知的，总有一天，地震预报是可以实现的。
