    Jiangsu Summarizes Experiences in Studying Chairman Mao's Works
    Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Issues Notice Emphasizing That Leading Cadres at All Levels Must Make Great Efforts to Study and Strive to Make Their Words and Deeds Conform to the Standards of Mao Zedong Thought to Achieve Correct Political Leadership
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th) The Communist Party organizations at all levels in Jiangsu Province have placed the summary and exchange of experiences and insights in studying Chairman Mao's works in a prominent position when summarizing last year's work and discussing this year's work plans. Through the summary, everyone believes that this year, studying Chairman Mao's works must be placed at the top of all work, to further arm the broad masses of cadres, party members, and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, to promote construction with revolution, and strive for greater achievements.
    Two years ago, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee made a regulation requiring all party members and cadres to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee established a central study group headed by the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. Central study groups have also been established in provincial-level agencies, local, municipal, and county party committees, and many commune party committees. Over the past two years, cadres in county-level and above agencies throughout the province have generally adhered to the study system. After studying Chairman Mao's works, the viewpoint of class struggle has been strengthened, there is more materialist dialectics and less subjectivism and metaphysics, and the viewpoint of practice and the mass viewpoint have been strengthened. In various regions and on all fronts, many advanced units and advanced individuals who creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works have emerged.
    During this summary of past learning experiences, various localities emphasized that to persist in studying Chairman Mao's works, it is first necessary to correctly position the relationship between politics and work. Only by being armed with Mao Zedong Thought can we do a good job in socialist revolution and socialist construction, can we change from poor to rich, and ensure that we will never change our colors and remain revolutionary forever. Many regions and units, in the process of learning, launched discussions on the fundamental issue of whether to give prominence to politics or to work, breaking away from the purely productive viewpoint and the purely business viewpoint, and further establishing the viewpoint of politics commanding economics and work. They recognized that in all work, whether or not politics is given prominence is a struggle between two roads and two lines, and politics and work must never be placed on an equal footing. The Dongtai County Party Committee said in its summary: "If politics is not in command, if Mao Zedong Thought is not in command, it is not only related to the question of whether an individual can be a thorough revolutionary, but more importantly, it is related to the major question of what banner to raise, what road to take, and where to lead the people of the county." The Baixia District of Nanjing City recently organized leading cadres at the grassroots level and office cadres throughout the district to conduct a major debate on the relationship between politics and work, clarifying various confused ideas, raising awareness of giving prominence to politics, and greatly improving the self-awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works.
    Whether one studies with problems in mind and creatively applies what one learns is related to whether the study can be lasting, in-depth, and effective. "Reading many times without the thought touching on the subject" will not allow one to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. This is the second lesson learned by various localities. In the summary, various localities believed that whether to study with problems in mind and creatively apply what one learns depends first on whether there is a self-awareness of guiding practice with theory, that is, whether or not one wants to bring up the problem. Second, it depends on whether there is a strong class sentiment, a high degree of revolutionary responsibility, that is, whether or not one is willing to bring up the problem. In response to this problem, some county party committees put forward three "not afraid"s: not afraid to expose contradictions in leadership work, not afraid to expose one's own thoughts, and not afraid to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Studying with problems in mind is a process of gradually deepening and gradually improving. At the beginning, one often studies with some fragmented and individual problems, and later gradually studies with some major problems. Leading cadres at all levels generally focus on issues such as class struggle, thought methods, investigation and research, cadre policies, and leadership styles, while going deep into the grassroots level to stay at selected points and set examples, while studying Chairman Mao's four philosophical essays and other relevant discussions, learning and applying at the same time, with very good results. In recent years, the Suzhou Special District has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, put Mao Zedong Thought in command, strengthened regular political and ideological work, fully utilized the active factors of people, and made every effort to tap potential, enabling the entire district to achieve agricultural harvests for four consecutive years.
    The third experience is to establish necessary learning systems, adapt to local conditions and people, and use flexible and diverse learning methods suitable for various work characteristics. Some organizations organize short-term study classes away from their posts, some organize reading groups, study seminars, or learning experience exchange meetings, and some hold "speaking and applying (speaking about how they creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works) meetings."
    The fourth experience is that leading cadres personally grasp the study and lead by example, that is, "leaders grasp, grasp the leaders."
    At present, the development of activities to study Chairman Mao's works in various parts of Jiangsu is still uneven. The main problem is that some leading comrades of party committees lack a deep understanding of the great significance of giving prominence to politics, and their leadership in grasping learning is not tight enough, sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The level of creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works by many comrades cannot adapt to the development of the situation.
    Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee issued a notice to party organizations at all levels throughout the province on better creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, requiring party organizations at all levels to further recognize the great significance of giving prominence to politics and studying Chairman Mao's works. In the study, it is necessary to grasp the living thoughts and practical problems in the current revolution and construction, and make great efforts in the aspect of "application."
    The notice also stipulates the current focus of study, especially studying Chairman Mao's theory on classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society; studying Chairman Mao's theory on the general line of socialist construction, understanding how to combine giving play to subjective initiative with respecting objective laws, and understanding how to combine revolutionary vigor with scientific spirit; in addition, it is also necessary to study Chairman Mao's materialist dialectics with "On Contradiction" as the core, understanding the law of mutual transformation between matter and spirit, mastering the method of one divides into two, opposing various subjectivism, opposing metaphysics and complicated philosophy, and better improving the leadership style.
    The notice emphasizes the need to vigorously grasp the study of leading cadres at all levels, to earnestly transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world, and to truly play an exemplary role among the broad masses of cadres and the masses. We must take Jiao Yulu as an example, strive to make our words and deeds conform to the standards of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve correct political leadership.

    在总结上年工作和讨论今年计划的时候
    江苏总结学习毛主席著作经验
    江苏省委发出通知，强调各级领导干部要狠下功夫学习，力争使自己的言行符合毛泽东思想的准则，实现正确的政治领导
    据新华社南京二十七日电  中共江苏省各级组织，在总结上一年工作，讨论今年工作计划时，把总结和交流学习毛主席著作的心得和经验，放在突出的地位。通过总结，大家认为，今年要更好地把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，进一步用毛泽东思想武装广大干部、党员和群众，以革命促建设，争取更大的成就。
    两年前，江苏省委曾作出规定，要求全体党员、干部认真学习毛泽东思想。省委常委建立了以省委第一书记为组长的中心学习小组。省级机关，各地、市、县委和很多公社党委，也都建立了中心学习组。两年来，全省县以上机关的干部，普遍坚持了学习制度。学习了毛主席著作，阶级斗争的观点有所增强，唯物辩证法多了一些，主观主义和形而上学少了一些，实践观点、群众观点加强了。各地各条战线上，涌现了许多活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物。
    这次各地在总结过去学习的经验时着重指出，要坚持学习毛主席著作，首先要摆正政治和业务的关系。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能搞好社会主义革命和社会主义建设，才能由穷变富，富不变色，永远革命。许多地区和单位在学习过程中，就突出政治还是突出业务这个根本性的问题展开了讨论，破单纯的生产观点，破单纯的业务观点，进一步树立政治统帅经济、统帅业务的观点。认识到在一切工作中，是否突出政治，是两条道路、两条路线的斗争，绝不能把政治和业务平列起来。东台县委在总结中说：“政治不挂帅，毛泽东思想不挂帅，不仅关系到个人能否做一个彻底革命派的问题，更重要的是关系到举什么旗帜，走什么道路，把全县人民带向哪里去的重大问题。”南京市白下区最近组织全区基层领导干部和机关干部，就政治和业务的关系问题开展了一场大辩论，澄清了各种糊涂思想，提高了对突出政治的认识，大大提高了对学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    是否带着问题学、活学活用，关系到学习能否持久、深入、有效。“读了很多遍，思想不沾边”，就不能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。这是各地总结的第二条经验。各地在总结中认为，是否带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，第一取决于是否有以理论指导实践的自觉性，也就是要不要带的问题。第二取决于是否有强烈的阶级感情，高度的革命责任心，也就是愿不愿带的问题。有的县委针对这个问题，提出了三不怕：不怕揭露领导工作中的矛盾，不怕暴露自己的思想，不怕开展批评和自我批评。带着问题学，是一个逐步深入逐步提高的过程。开始往往带一些零碎的、个别的问题学，以后逐步带一些重大的问题学。各级领导干部一般都围绕阶级斗争、思想方法、调查研究、干部政策、领导作风等问题，一面深入基层蹲点，办样板，一面学习毛主席的四篇哲学论文和其他有关论述，边学边用，效果很好。苏州专区近几年来坚持学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想挂帅，加强了经常性的政治思想工作，充分发挥人的积极因素，千方百计挖掘潜力，使全区连续四年获得农业丰收。
    第三条经验是建立必要的学习制度，因地因人制宜，运用灵活多样适应各种工作特点的学习方法。有的组织短期离职学习的读书班，有的组织读书会、学习座谈会或学习经验交流会，有的举办“讲用（讲自己如何活学活用毛主席著作）会”。
    第四条经验是领导干部亲自抓学习，领导干部带头学习，也就是“头头抓，抓头头”。
    目前，江苏各地学习毛主席著作的活动，发展还不平衡，主要问题是，有些党委领导同志，对于突出政治的重大意义缺乏深切体会，对于学习领导抓而不紧，时紧时松。不少同志活学活用毛主席著作的水平，不能适应形势的发展。
    最近，江苏省委向全省各级党组织发出了关于更好地活学活用毛主席著作的通知，要求各级党组织进一步认识突出政治、学习毛主席著作的伟大意义。在学习中要抓住当前革命和建设中的活思想和现实问题，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    通知还规定了当前学习的重点，特别是学习毛主席关于社会主义社会中阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的理论；学习毛主席关于社会主义建设总路线的理论，懂得把发挥主观能动性和尊重客观规律结合起来，懂得把革命干劲和科学精神结合起来；另外，还要学习毛主席的以《矛盾论》为核心的唯物辩证法，懂得物质与精神相互转化的规律，掌握一分为二的方法，反对各种主观主义，反对形而上学、烦琐哲学，更好地改进领导作风。
    通知强调要狠抓各级领导干部的学习，要在改造客观世界的同时，认真改造自己的主观世界，在广大干部和群众中，真正起模范作用。要以焦裕禄为榜样，力求使自己的言行符合于毛泽东思想的准则，实现正确的政治领导。
