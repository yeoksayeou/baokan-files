    “Decision Unfulfilled, or No Decision Made?”
    In the past, we did not conduct thorough investigations and research according to Chairman Mao's instructions, therefore, the plan formulated to change the face of Dongming was not entirely in line with the objective situation. Now, we are determined to go to the masses and to the struggle for production with Chairman Mao's writings, to carry out meticulous investigation and research work, and to re-understand the natural laws of Dongming.
    Dongming County has also undergone changes in recent years, but the changes have not been large enough or fast enough. What is the reason? It is not that the masses are backward, nor that the masses are willing to suffer; the main reason is that our county party committee has not been thoroughly revolutionized, and has not studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings as flexibly as Comrade Jiao Yulu, putting great effort into the word "use," and conducting in-depth investigation and research according to Chairman Mao's teachings to grasp first-hand materials. Therefore, we cannot make up our minds to change the face of Dongming, nor can we make plans. Even if we make plans, they are not entirely in line with the objective conditions of Dongming.
    Why can't we go deep down and conduct meticulous investigations and research like Comrade Jiao Yulu? It is because we lack the spirit of "complete" and "thorough" service to the people. We always think that this matter needs to be handled by me, and that problem needs to be solved by me, so how can I find time to conduct investigations and research? Now it seems that it is not that there are too many affairs and we can't spare the time, but that we lack determination. A chronic problem was revealed at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee at the end of 1965: we did not stay put during the squatting, and the model was not prominent. The conclusion is: the decision was not fulfilled, or no decision was made.
    To personally weigh the "three harms" and see how much weight they carry, grand blueprints are not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu. We once thought that we had grasped the natural laws of the county, that we had found a way to change the face of Dongming, and that the direction was clear. Now we feel that it is far from enough. The "laws" and "ways" that we thought we had grasped were only general and "universal" things, and these universal things were mostly other people's experiences, "food chewed by others," not things that were discovered through our own practice. How many sand dunes are there in Dongming, and how many wind gaps are there? We don't know; how to transform each piece of waterlogged and saline-alkali land, we have no idea; how the forest belts should be distributed, and how the ditches should be arranged, we have not come up with a plan and implemented it.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "The power of example is infinite." In the past, our understanding of this point was also not profound. Therefore, we did not establish a living example for the people of the whole county. Like Lankao, the broad masses of Dongming, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have a strong desire to change the face of "poverty and blankness" and a firm revolutionary spirit, and have unlimited creativity. For example, Jia Village, Jiaolou Wusheng Bridge, which develop forestry through self-reliance, Dawangzhai, which consolidates and develops the collective economy in difficulties, Yaocun and Lao Luozhai, which are good at raising livestock, and Meizhuang, which does a good job in diversified management. These are our own Hancun, our own Qinzhai, our own Zhao Duolou, our own Shuang Yangshu. However, we have not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, summarized a new road for Dongming. We went down, but we also didn't go down; we contacted the poor and lower-middle peasants, but we also didn't contact them. However, we were accustomed to running around and did not deeply root ourselves among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Good typical examples could not be discovered in time, and even if they were discovered, they could not be gathered together, let alone publicize them and powerfully call on the broad masses to learn from them.
    Now, the burden of changing the face of Dongming is placed before us. This is the demand of the Party and the people. We are determined to re-understand the objective conditions of Dongming and change the backward face of Dongming County, which is prone to disasters and has low yields.

    “决心没实现，还是没决心”
    过去，我们没有按照毛主席的指示进行深入的调查研究，因此，制订的改变东明面貌的计划不尽符合客观情况。现在，我们决心带着毛主席著作，到群众中去，到生产斗争中去，进行细致的调查研究工作，重新认识东明的自然规律
    近年东明县也有变化，但是变化不够大，不够快。原因在哪里？不是群众落后，不是群众甘愿受苦；最主要的是我们县委没有彻底革命化，没有象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，按照毛主席的教导，去深入地进行调查研究，掌握第一手材料。因此，对改变东明面貌下不了决心，作不出计划，即使作出计划，也不尽符合东明的客观情况。
    我们为什么不能象焦裕禄同志那样深入下去，做细致的调查研究呢？就是因为缺乏“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神。总认为这个事情需要我处理，那个问题需要我解决，哪能抽出时间去搞调查研究？现在看来，不是事务多，抽不出身，而是决心不大。一九六五年底的一次县委常委生活会上，检查出来的一个老毛病仍然存在：蹲点没蹲住，样板不突出。结论是：决心没实现，还是没决心。
    要亲自掂一掂“三害”究竟有多大份量的宏图大略也不如焦裕禄同志。我们曾经认为，县里的自然规律摸到了，改变东明面貌的路子有了，方向明了。现在才感到远远不够。自以为摸到了的“规律”、“路子”，只不过是笼统的、带有“普遍性”的东西，而且这普遍性的东西又多是别人的经验，是“别人嚼过的馍”，不是通过自己的实践摸出来的。东明究竟有多少沙丘，有多少风口？我们不清楚；每一片涝洼、盐碱地如何改造，心中也无数；林带如何分布，沟渠如何安排，也都没有搞出方案，落实下来。
    焦裕禄同志说：“榜样的力量是无穷的。”过去，我们对这一点的认识也很不深刻。所以，没有给全县人民树立活的样板。与兰考一样，东明的广大群众，特别是贫下中农，有着强烈的改变“一穷二白”面貌的愿望和坚定的革命精神，有着无限的创造力。如自力更生发展林业的贾庄、焦楼武胜桥，在困难中巩固发展集体经济的大王寨，饲养牲畜好的姚村、老罗寨，多种经营搞得好的梅庄等，这是我们自己的韩村，自己的秦寨，自己的赵垛楼，自己的双杨树。但是，我们没有象焦裕禄同志那样，总结出东明的新道路。说没下去，也下去了；说没与贫下中农接触，也接触了，但是，习惯于跑跑转转，没有把根深深地扎在贫下中农中间，好典型不能及时发现，发现了也不能集中起来，更不能为其鸣锣开道，有力地号召广大群众向他们学习。
    现在，改变东明面貌的担子摆在我们的面前。这是党和人民的要求。我们决心重新认识东明的客观条件，改变东明县多灾低产的落后面貌。  山东东明县委书记  陈惠民
