    Observing Changes from the Blackboard Newspaper
    Li Mengqiu, Liuzhou Machinery Factory

    Every day, many new things happen in the factory. And these new things are closely linked to a great thought, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. Take the new thing of the families in the Tenth Residential Area running a blackboard newspaper, for example, it is inseparable from the upsurge of the families studying Chairman Mao's works.

    This residential area was originally a well-known "breeding ground for gossip," but after studying Chairman Mao's works, people's mental outlook has completely changed. They earnestly carried out criticism and self-criticism, resolving many old grudges that had existed among the families for many years. At the study sessions of Chairman Mao's works, they talked about their心得 (xinde, insights) and experiences from their studies, and also set up a blackboard newspaper themselves. On the blackboard newspaper, there were criticisms, commendations, self-examinations, as well as learning gains and thoughts. The content of the blackboard newspaper was rich and very timely. Good people and good deeds were reported within three days, and outstanding good deeds were published as red-character posters on the same day. This greatly encouraged all the families and workers in the area.

    The families have started a blackboard newspaper, and the blackboard newspaper has become a position for them to arm and transform themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Now let's look at an article written by a family member named Li Cuiying, with the help of someone, recording her own experience in studying Chairman Mao's works! The article is written like this:

    …Recalling my study of the “Mao Works” since then, the gains are indeed many. Chairman Mao told me that people live not only for themselves, but for others, for the revolution, like Zhang Side being loyal to the people. Therefore, I am determined to get rid of the past idea of “eating men's food and managing my own family,” step out of the kitchen, participate in the masses, and do my part to improve mass work. Chairman Mao also taught me that to truly be wholeheartedly for the collective and for the revolution, we must oppose liberalism. Upon inspection, I have committed a lot of liberalism, and I am determined to correct it.

      Over the past year, through studying “Selected Works of Mao” in the residential area and with my husband, I have basically changed the past situation of quarreling and disharmony with my husband, improved neighborly relations, and promoted the development of my family work. Through studying “Selected Works of Mao,” I have initially tasted the sweetness and deeply realized that Chairman Mao's works are truly the beacon in my heart.
  
  At first glance, this article seems ordinary, but those who know the situation well know that the manuscript written by Li Cuiying is not simple at all!

    This matter has to be told from the beginning. Once, the families gathered together as usual to study Chairman Mao's works, listening to the instructor explain the article "Serve the People." At that time, the instructor talked about how people should not live only for themselves, but for others, for the revolution, and should be loyal to the people like Zhang Side… and also said that some workers' families in our factory are not united, and comrades do not speak to each other for several years over small things… Li Cuiying was famous for quarreling in the residential area, and people also called her the "Quarrel King." At this time, when she heard this, she immediately felt a burning sensation on her face. She lowered her head and recalled that since she had quarreled with Ouyang Ying, she had not spoken a word for eight years, and they met like enemies. What a wrong behavior this was! However, when she thought of reconciling with Ouyang Ying, she felt embarrassed and could not save face. While hesitating, the group later studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." She thought, if the Foolish Old Man could have the courage to move the mountains, couldn't I even have the courage to take the initiative to say a word for the sake of unity? So in a discussion, she intentionally sat with Ouyang Ying. She lowered her head, and her mind was tumbling and struggling with how to say the first sentence in eight years to Ouyang Ying, but Ouyang Ying took the initiative to approach her. She couldn't express what this taste was all of a sudden, she only felt a surge of heat, almost crying at the meeting! Since then, these neighbors, who had troubled the leaders and the masses with much talk, and whom countless large and small meetings could not reconcile, who had not spoken for eight years, finally reconciled. Now, when they meet, they no longer spit or slam the door, but say intimately:

    “Sister! I’m going to buy vegetables, do you want me to bring anything?”

    “Oh! Bring me some lean pork.”

    “It’s my turn to work in the factory tomorrow!”

    “Don't worry! I'll cook for you."

    Once, Ouyang Ying was making a piece of clothing and didn't know how to make it well. When Li Cuiying found out, she went over and took it over, and sewed it on her sewing machine for her. Now, Li Cuiying is no longer the "Quarrel King" of the past. In the year-end evaluation of 1965, everyone said Li Cuiying was good and rated her as a model. Now she is also the leader of the study group of Chairman Mao's works in this residential area! The previous blackboard newspaper manuscript was written based on her dictation after such an arduous ideological struggle.

    In fact, the blackboard newspaper is indeed an indispensable thing for the families in this residential area to study Chairman Mao's works. As long as you stand there, those simple sentences will make you feel that what you see in front of you is not just a series of blackboard newspaper articles, but also seeing their smiling faces and hearing their laughter…

    “In the past, I liked to quarrel with others. After studying 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains,' I had an understanding in my mind. If the Foolish Old Man could move the mountains, couldn't we families stop quarreling? What's the point of quarreling! In the future, everyone should give way to each other when they quarrel. And when they see others not cherishing trees, they should also carry out criticism."

    This is what a family member named Shen Xiuying wrote when she saw that Li Cuiying had examined her shortcomings of loving to quarrel on the blackboard newspaper.

    There is also a family member named Li Jianping, her manuscript is a poem:

    Pick up Chairman Mao's book,
    A heart full of enthusiasm;
    One article, one red flag,
    One line, one pillar holding up the sky.
    Read carefully with class feelings,
    Read it once and take a step further.
    When you encounter problems, pick up the book,
    Solve them easily with full confidence.
    Pick up Chairman Mao's book,
    A round red sun shines overhead.
    There is a revolutionary sword in the book,
    There is a revolutionary road in the book.
    When you encounter problems, pick up the book,
    Thousands of difficulties can't stop you.
    When you face victory, pick up the book,
    Continue to work hard and not be satisfied.

    从黑板报上看变化
    柳州机械厂　李梦秋
    每天，厂里都出现不少新鲜事。而这些新鲜事又都与一个伟大的思想紧紧连在一起，那就是毛泽东思想。拿第十一家属区的家属们办黑板报这桩新事来说吧，就和家属们大学毛主席著作的热潮分不开。
    这个家属区原来是个有名的“是非窝”，可是学习毛主席著作以后，人的精神面貌可完全改变了。她们认真的开展了批评和自我批评，解开了许多在家属之间存在了多年的老疙瘩。在学习毛主席著作的小组会上，她们大谈自己学习的心得和体会，还自己动手，办起了一块黑板报。黑板报上，有批评，有表扬，有自我检讨，还有学习的收获、感想。黑板报内容丰富，并且非常及时，好人好事不过三天，突出的好事，当天另出红色的大字报。这对全区家属和职工鼓舞可大啦。
    家属们办起了黑板报，黑板报也就成了她们用毛泽东思想武装和改造自己的思想阵地。下面让我们来看一篇一个名叫李翠英的家属请人帮她记录的一篇她自己学习毛主席著作的心得吧！这篇文章是这样写的：
    ……回忆我学习“毛著”以来，收获确实不少。毛主席告诉我，人活着不是光为自己，而是为别人，为革命，象张思德那样忠于人民。因此，我决心去掉过去那种“吃的是男人饭，管的是自己家”的 思想，走出厨房，参加到群众中去，尽自己的一份力量，搞好群众工作。毛主席又教导我，要真正做到一心为集体，为革命，就要反对自由主义。检查起来，我犯了不少自由主义，我下决心改正。
      一年来，通过在家属区和爱人学“毛选”，基本上改变了过去与爱人闹嘴不和睦的情况，也改善了友邻的关系，促进了自己所负家属工作的开展。通过学“毛选”，初步吃到了甜头，深深体会到毛主席著作真正是我心里的明灯。
  这篇稿子，乍看起来好象平常，但是熟知情况的人，就知道李翠英写的这篇稿件，可不简单哩！
    这事还得从头说起。有一次，家属们照例聚集在一起学习毛主席著作，听辅导员讲解《为人民服务》这篇文章，当时辅导员讲到人活着不能光是为自己，而是为别人、为革命，要象张思德那样忠于人民……又说我们厂有些职工家属，闹不团结，同志间为一点小事，就几年不讲话……。李翠英当时在家属区吵架是出名的，人们还把她叫做“吵架大王”。这时，她听到这里，顿时便感到脸上火辣辣的。她低头回想自己和欧阳英吵架以来，八年不讲一句话，见面如敌人一样，这是多么错误的行为呵！可是，当她一想到要和欧阳英和好时，又觉得有些难为情，拉不下面子来。正犹豫，后来小组里又学习了《愚公移山》，她想，愚公能够有移山的勇气，难道我连为了搞好团结，主动说一句话的勇气都没有么？于是在一次讨论时，她便有意和欧阳英坐在一起。她低着头，脑子里正在翻腾着、斗争着如何向欧阳英开口讲八年来的第一句话时，欧阳英竟主动地和她亲近。她蓦地一下说不出这是个什么滋味，只觉得一身热血沸腾，差点没在会上哭了出来！从此，这个曾经费了领导和群众多少口舌，大会小会开了许多次始终调解不好，八年不讲话的邻居，终于和好了。现在，她们见面不再是吐口水，摔门，而是亲昵地说着：
    “阿嫂！我去买菜，要带点什么吗？”
    “哦！帮我带点瘦猪肉回来。”
    “明天轮到我进厂做工啦！”
    “你放心去吧！我帮你煮饭。”
    一次，欧阳英做一件衣服，正不知怎么做好，李翠英知道了，便过去接过来，就在自己衣车上帮她缝好了。现在，李翠英再也不是过去的“吵架大王”了。一九六五年年终评比时，大家都说李翠英好，评她为模范。现在她还担任了这个家属区学习毛主席著作的学习组长哩！前面那篇黑板报稿，就是她经过了这么一场艰苦的思想斗争，才叫人根据她的口述写出来的。
    说实在的，黑板报对这个家属区的家属们学习毛主席著作来说，确是一件不可少的东西。只要你去在那里站一站，那些朴实的字句，会使你觉得眼前看到的不仅是一篇篇黑板报的文章，而且是看到了她们的笑脸，听到了她们的笑声……
    “过去，我爱和别人吵， 经过学习《愚公移山》，思想上有了认识，愚公能移山，难道我们家属不吵嘴还做不到？吵嘴有什么意思！以后别人再吵时，都要互相让。可见到别人不爱护树木，还要开展批评。”
    这是一个名叫申秀英的家属，当她看到李翠英在黑板报上检讨了自己爱吵架的缺点时，也写了这样的一篇稿。
    还有一个名叫李建萍的家属，她的稿是一首诗：
    拿起毛主席的书，
    满腔热血涌心头；
    一篇一面大红旗，
    一行一根顶天柱。
    带着阶级感情细心读，
    读一遍来进一步。
    遇到问题拿起书，
    迎刃而解信心足。
    拿起毛主席的书，
    一轮红日当头照。
    书中有把革命剑，
    书中有条革命路。
    遇到问题拿起书，
    千难万难挡不住。
    在胜利面前拿起书，
    再接再厉不满足。（附图片）
