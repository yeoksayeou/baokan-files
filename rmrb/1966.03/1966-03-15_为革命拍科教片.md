    Making Educational Films for the Revolution
    Beijing Science Education Film Studio Wu Tinggen

    Last year, we went to eight counties and cities in Sichuan to screen the science education films produced by our studio and solicit audience opinions. Through discussions with peasant audiences, we were greatly enlightened.

    In the past, although we rationally recognized that making science education films was to serve the people, we didn't truly appreciate the significance of our work in our hearts because we hadn't solved the problem of transforming our worldview and were seriously divorced from the worker-peasant masses. We considered the job done once the script was written, without asking about its meaning or effect. This showed a lack of political responsibility. During our investigation in Xuyong County, Sichuan, a commune Party secretary asked us to make a film on preventing and controlling rice diseases. He said, "One year, more than half of our rice fields were affected by rice blast, causing a serious reduction in production. We couldn't cure it, so we could only grieve over those fields." During this investigation, the masses' opinions made me realize a fundamental problem that must be solved: that is, to make science education films for the revolution and for socialist construction. Therefore, the films we make must be understandable and usable by the people we serve—the worker-peasant masses—and truly play a role in production. We must make science education films with deep class feelings and a high degree of revolutionary spirit.

    The screening effects of the films we took to Sichuan this time were different. Generally speaking, if the films were understandable and usable by the masses, and could solve their problems, they were very welcome. Films that the masses couldn't use, even if they were beautifully made, received a cold response, and sometimes even resentment. For example, "Prevention and Treatment of Tinea Capitis" and "Rural Drinking Water Hygiene" were both health education films and both addressed problems urgently needing solutions in rural areas. People requested screenings of both films. However, the reactions after the screenings were completely different. The masses felt that the "Prevention and Treatment of Tinea Capitis" film was relatable, and many of the methods could be followed based on the film. However, in the "Rural Drinking Water Hygiene" film, the methods in the first half were applicable, while those in the second half were somewhat out of touch with reality, introducing measures that were overly focused on being large-scale and foreign, violating the principles of spending less money to do more and doing things well without spending money. Farmers said, "The methods are good, but they can't be done." They also said, "The methods introduced in the film are only for the future, and don't solve the current problems." For example, some films, although technically inferior, were welcomed by the masses because they could solve problems. For example, after watching "Do Not Feed Cattle with Sweet Potatoes with Black Spot Disease," the masses understood the scientific principles and would consciously protect their farm cattle.

    From this, I have gained a little understanding: the quality of a film should have a real standard. It can't be like in the past, where it was considered good as long as colleagues in the film industry praised it. Instead, it should be praised by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and by the specific target audience, to be considered truly good. The standard for judging quality is how the film actually contributes to production and whether it solves urgent problems. Sending charcoal in the snow is precious because the charcoal is sent into the snow. If the charcoal is sent in the spring when flowers are blooming, how much value does it have? In the final analysis, we must have the masses in our eyes and start everything from the needs of the masses, solve problems for the masses, take the needs of the masses as our needs, and take the standards of the masses as our standards.

    The problem of making films understandable to the audience is also a matter of mass perspective. Generally speaking, the farmer masses who viewed the films we took to Sichuan were basically able to understand their meaning, but there were many presentation methods that the masses couldn't understand. Some film techniques such as fades, wipes, and so on, are commonplace in our film industry, but the masses don't understand what they mean when they see them. Therefore, sometimes the problems we want to emphasize are over-emphasized by using techniques, and the farmers can't understand them. For example, in the film "Spring Corn Fertilizer and Water Management," the author used a wipe to introduce the internal setting of corn kernels. As a result, when we asked many farmers, they didn't know what that part of the film was about. Some people even misunderstood the sprout as a corn borer. Some of our comrades said that it is natural for farmers not to understand because they watch too few films. They will get used to it after watching more. This is asking the masses to adapt to us, rather than us adapting to the masses; it is asking the farmers to serve science education films, rather than us serving the farmers. We should try every means to make our rural audience understand our films, create the characteristics of our country's science education films, and not be bound by foreign conventions, which affect farmers' viewing of films. To achieve this, we must first revolutionize our thinking, establish the view of serving the people wholeheartedly, and make every effort to make the audience understand. In terms of creation methods, we must be nationalistic and understand the masses' likes, dislikes, and understanding habits. Only with the view of making science education films for the revolution, and truly having the masses in our eyes, can we make good films that are welcomed by the masses. (Attached pictures)

    为革命拍科教片
    北京科学教育电影制片厂　伍廷根
    去年我们到四川八个县市放映我厂出品的科教片，征求观众意见。通过和农民观众座谈，使我们受到很大启发。
    过去我们虽然在理性上也认识到拍科教片是为人民服务，但是由于没有从改造世界观上解决问题，再加上又严重脱离工农群众，因此感情上并没有真正体会到自己工作的重大意义。把剧本写出来以后就算完事，也不问剧本的意义和效果如何，这是缺乏政治责任感的表现。这次我们在四川叙永县调查时，有一位公社党委书记要求我们拍一部防治水稻病害的影片。他说：“有一年我们的稻田有一半以上得了稻瘟病，造成严重减产，我们没法治，只好对着这些田难过。”在这次调查中，群众的意见使我体会到一个根本问题必须解决：那就是为革命而拍科教片，为社会主义建设而拍科教片。因此我们拍的影片必须让服务对象——工农群众看得懂，用得上，真正对生产起作用。我们必须怀着深厚的阶级感情和高度的革命精神来拍科教片。
    这次我们带到四川去的影片放映效果是不同的。总的说来，如果是群众能看得懂，用得上，能为他们解决问题的影片，群众就非常欢迎。群众用不上的影片，即使拍得再好看，反应也很冷淡，有时甚至反感。比如《防治头癣》和《农村饮水卫生》同是卫生教育片，同是农村迫切需要解决的问题，人们知道有这两部片子都纷纷要求放映。但放映以后的反应却截然不同。群众认为防治头癣影片看来亲切，有许多办法可以照电影来办。而《农村饮水卫生》一片前半部的办法适用，后半部则有些脱离实际，介绍的一些措施是追求大、洋，违反少花钱多办事、不花钱办好事的原则。农民说：“办法好是好，就是办不到。”又说：“影片介绍的办法只是将来的方向，不解决目前问题。”又如有些影片，虽然在制作技巧上比较差些，但能解决问题，群众就欢迎。如《不要用黑斑病甘薯喂牛》，群众看过后，懂得了科学道理，就会自觉地保护耕牛。
    从这里我得到一点体会：片子的好坏，应当有一个真正的标准，不能象过去，只要电影圈内同行叫好就行了，而是要工农兵叫好，特定服务对象叫好，才算真正好。考核好坏的标准就是影片在生产上的作用到底如何，是否解决了迫切问题。雪里送炭之所以可贵，乃是把炭送到雪里去，如果春暖花开时节，才把炭送去，还有多大价值呢？归根到底，我们眼睛里要有群众，一切都从群众需要出发，为群众解决问题，以群众的需要为我们的需要，以群众的标准为我们的标准。
    让观众看得懂影片的问题也是个群众观点问题。我们带到四川去的影片，总的来说，农民群众基本上能领会其中意思，但是有许多表现方法，群众看不懂。有些电影技巧如淡入淡出，圈入圈出，……诸如此类，在我们电影界是家常便饭，可是群众看了却不知道是什么意思。因此有时我们想强调说明的问题，用了技巧以后，讲究过多了，农民反而看不懂。例如《春玉米肥水管理》影片，作者用圈出的办法介绍玉米内部坐胎的情况，结果我们问了许多农民，都不知道影片这一段讲的什么。甚至有人把那个芽子理解成玉米钻心虫了。我们有些同志说，农民看不懂那是很自然的事，因为他们看电影看得太少，等以后他们看多了，就习惯了。这是要求群众来适应我们，而不是我们去适应群众；是要农民为科教片服务，而不是我们去为农民服务。我们应当想尽一切办法，让我们的农村观众看懂我们的影片，创造出我国科教片的特色，不要受洋框框的束缚，影响农民看片。要做到这一点，我们首先要思想革命化，树立全心全意为人民服务的观点，千方百计让观众看懂。在创作方法上则要民族化，要摸清群众的喜恶和理解习惯。只有为革命拍科教片的观点，眼里真正有群众，才能拍出群众欢迎的好影片。（附图片）
