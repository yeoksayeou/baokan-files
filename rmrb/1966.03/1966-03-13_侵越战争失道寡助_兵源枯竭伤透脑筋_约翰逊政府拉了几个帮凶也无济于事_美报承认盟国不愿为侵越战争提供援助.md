    The Unjustified War of Aggression Against Vietnam Gains Little Support; Dwindling Troop Resources Cause Headaches
    The Johnson Administration's Recruitment of a Few Accomplices Proves Ineffective
    American Newspaper Admits Allies Are Unwilling to Provide Assistance for the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, March 11th -- Our correspondent reports: The American Johnson administration, through exerting pressure and engaging in bribery, has recently scraped together a group of accomplice troops from South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, totaling 25,000 men. Among them, the South Korean Park Chung-hee clique provided a division and a regiment, totaling 20,000 men; Australia 3,000 men; and the Philippines 2,000 men.
    This is yet another piece of evidence of the Johnson administration's deliberate expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam by exploiting its running dogs. In order to make up for the inadequacy of American troops in the war of aggression against Vietnam and to alleviate the pressure of the United States acting alone in the war, the Johnson administration has been employing both soft and hard tactics to force its allies and lackeys to sacrifice their lives for the American aggression against Vietnam. However, very few have responded to this appeal from the United States.
    U.S. Vice President Humphrey's trip to Asia and Oceania in February had as one of its main tasks a new effort to scrape together cannon fodder. According to information that has already been revealed, Humphrey expended considerable effort and spent a large amount of U.S. dollars to obtain just over 20,000 people. In South Korea, the conditions for reaching this deal were: the United States would equip three reserve divisions in South Korea in the coming years, and update the equipment of the existing seventeen army divisions and one marine division, increase economic "aid" to the puppet regime, and provide other "benefits."
    In Australia, Humphrey agreed to purchase a large quantity of small arms ammunition as an exchange condition for increasing cannon fodder. Against the Philippines, the threat of stopping "aid" was used as coercion.
    The Johnson administration's practice of driving the Park Chung-hee puppet clique and the reactionary authorities of Australia and the Philippines to grab chestnuts from the fire for the American policy of aggression against Vietnam has further aroused waves of protest and anger from the people of South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines. The struggle against American imperialism and against the accomplice behavior of their own reactionary factions has become even more intense. In Australia and the Philippines, people "welcomed" and "farewelled" Humphrey with angry demonstrations and loud anti-American slogans. In South Korea, this new crime of the Park Chung-hee clique selling out national interests has further strengthened the South Korean people's determination to fight against American and puppet rule.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 11th -- The weekly *U.S. News & World Report* admits that America's allies are "generally unwilling" to provide military assistance for America's war of aggression against Vietnam.
    This weekly, in its March 14th issue, published in advance, carried an article titled: "What Can the U.S. Expect From Allies in Vietnam War?" The article said, "The Vietnam War reached a new peak of sustained intensity in late February and early March," and U.S. casualties are "approaching the costly figures of the Korean War," and the "prospect is that the war will become more intense—with casualties increasing daily."
    The article admits that "South Vietnam's troop resources are now on the verge of exhaustion. The prospect of getting help from other sources is also bleak." The article points out that U.S. Vice President Humphrey's "frantic mission to solicit aid" in nine Asian countries and regions, which just ended, achieved very meager results.
    The article says, "Many people in Congress are asking the government to explain why the United States has repeatedly appealed without getting more help." The article believes that there are several aspects to the answer:
      "Many countries are adopting an evasive attitude because the Asian war seems distant...Beyond indifference, there is also suspicion of America's Asian policy...
      "The situation is the same in Western Europe, Scandinavia, and the Middle East. People—and governments—feel confused and say that America's attempts to drag them in annoy and embarrass them.
      "Many of America's allies in Europe first doubt whether America's actions in Vietnam are wise. France has openly expressed disapproval of the war. The Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, Greece, and other countries that sent troops to Korea have never shown any interest in Vietnam...The general idea is: let Uncle Sam do it."
    The article emphasizes: "Generally speaking, throughout Asia, people find that free countries are very sensitive about openly standing with the United States to help conduct the Vietnam War."
    "The general unwillingness of allies to come forward and participate in the Vietnam War—or provide troops—is to a considerable extent beginning to affect America's war burden." (Attached picture)

    侵越战争失道寡助  兵源枯竭伤透脑筋
    约翰逊政府拉了几个帮凶也无济于事
    美报承认盟国不愿为侵越战争提供援助
    新华社十一日讯　本社记者报道：美国约翰逊政府通过施加压力和进行收买的手段，最近从南朝鲜、澳大利亚和菲律宾搜罗了一批帮凶军，共两万五千人。其中，南朝鲜朴正熙集团提供一个师和一个团，共两万人；澳大利亚三千人；菲律宾两千人。
    这是约翰逊政府利用它的走狗蓄意扩大侵越战争的又一罪证。为了弥补美国侵越兵力之不足和减轻美国在侵越战争中单干的压力，约翰逊政府一直在软硬兼施地要它的盟国和仆从为美国侵略越南卖命，但是响应美国这一呼吁的寥寥无几。
    美国副总统汉弗莱二月间的亚洲和大洋洲之行，其主要任务之一，就是作一次新的努力来搜罗炮灰。根据目前已经透露的情况来看，汉弗莱费了不少口舌、花了大量美元，才弄到这么两万多人。在南朝鲜，达成这笔交易的条件是：美国将在今后几年内装备南朝鲜三个后备师，并且更新现有的陆军十七个师和海军陆战队一个师的装备，增加对伪政权的经济“援助”以及给予其他“好处”。
    在澳大利亚，汉弗莱同意向它购买大量小型武器弹药，作为增加炮灰的交换条件。对菲律宾，则以停止“援助”进行要挟。
    约翰逊政府驱使朴正熙傀儡集团和澳、菲两国反动当局为美国侵略越南的政策火中取栗的做法，进一步激起了南朝鲜人民和澳、菲两国人民的抗议怒潮，反对美帝国主义和反对本国反动派的帮凶行为的斗争更加高涨。在澳大利亚和菲律宾，人们以愤怒的示威和响亮的反美口号“欢迎”“欢送”汉弗莱；在南朝鲜，朴正熙集团出卖民族利益的这一新罪行，进一步加强了南朝鲜人民反对美伪统治的斗争决心。
    新华社十一日讯　《美国新闻与世界报道》周刊承认，美国的盟国“普遍不愿意”对美国的侵越战争提供军事援助。
    这家周刊在提前出版的三月十四日的一期里，刊载了一篇标题是：《美国在越南战争中能够对盟国指望什么？》的文章。文章说，“越南战争在二月底三月初达到持续激烈的新高峰”，美国的伤亡人数“接近代价巨大的朝鲜战争的数字”，“前景是战争将愈益炽烈——伤亡人数日益增加。”
    文章承认，“南越的兵源现在已经濒于枯竭。从其他方面得到帮助的前景也黯淡。”文章指出，美国副总统汉弗莱刚刚结束的对九个亚洲国家和地区“拼命求援的访问”，成绩非常可怜。
    文章说，“许多国会里的人士要求政府解释，为什么美国几次三番地呼吁而得不到更多的帮助。”文章认为，回答有几个方面：
      “许多国家采取规避态度，因为亚洲战争看来是遥远的……不关心之上，还有对美国的亚洲政策的怀疑……
      “西欧、斯堪的纳维亚和中东的情况也是这样。人民——和政府——感到迷惑不解，并且说美国要把他们卷进去的企图使他们感到烦恼和为难。
      “美国在欧洲的不少盟国首先怀疑美国在越南的行动是否明智。法国公开表示不赞成这场战争。荷兰、比利时、土耳其、希腊和其他曾出兵朝鲜的国家，从来没有对越南表示过任何兴趣……总的想法是：让山姆大叔去干吧。”
    文章强调说：“一般地说，在整个亚洲，人们发现，自由国家对于公开同美国站在一起来帮助进行越南战争这一点是很敏感的。
    “盟国普遍不愿意挺身而出参加越南战争——或者提供军队——其结果在相当程度上开始影响美国的战争负担。”（附图片）
