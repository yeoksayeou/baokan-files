    This year, March 19th marks the sixteenth anniversary of the nationwide anti-American struggle in Vietnam. March 12th to 19th is "Week of Solidarity with the Vietnamese People" worldwide. The Chinese people, with extreme excitement, review the heroic and outstanding struggle waged by the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism over the past sixteen years, and express our highest respect for the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal Vietnamese people in this great struggle and the enormous contributions they have made to the world revolutionary cause.
    On March 16, 1950, U.S. imperialism dispatched two destroyers of the Seventh Fleet to Saigon and sent a large number of aircraft from aircraft carriers to intrude into Saigon's airspace, using "armed demonstration" to threaten the Vietnamese people. This provocative act by the United States aroused great anger among the Vietnamese people. On March 19th, Saigon students and citizens held a massive anti-American demonstration, forcing the two U.S. destroyers to flee with their tails between their legs the next day. This event clearly exposed the ambition of U.S. imperialism to invade Vietnam and replace France's colonial position in Vietnam, and it was also the first victory of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialist aggression and intervention.
    U.S. imperialism creates tension and carries out aggression everywhere in the world. It believes that this will achieve the goal of intimidating and enslaving the people of all countries. In fact, on the contrary, it has played a role in mobilizing the people of all countries, forcing them to take action, struggle, and defeat the American aggressors. The development of the situation in Vietnam over the past sixteen years vividly proves this point.
    Since the March 19th, 1950 incident, U.S. imperialism has gradually infiltrated Vietnam. After the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, U.S. imperialism marched straight into South Vietnam, completely replacing the position of the French colonists. U.S. imperialism supported the South Vietnamese puppet regime and launched a "special war." After the "special war" suffered defeat, U.S. imperialism sent a large number of expeditionary troops into South Vietnam and brazenly bombed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. But the result was to arouse a deeper national hatred among the South Vietnamese people, who launched an increasingly heroic and tenacious battle. The South Vietnamese people's armed forces routed the U.S. aggressor forces, which possessed modern equipment, and brought them to a dead end. The bombing of North Vietnam by U.S. air bandits has made 31 million Vietnamese people unite as one against the enemy, and more closely unite to launch a nationwide, great war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.
    The mobilizing effect of U.S. imperialism is not limited to Vietnam. The Johnson administration attempted to expand the war to the entire Indochina to save its defeat in South Vietnam, which resulted in resolute resistance from the people of Laos and Cambodia. Washington drove the South Korean puppet group and servant states such as Australia and New Zealand to provide cannon fodder for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, and used Japan and Thailand as forward bases for the war of aggression against Vietnam, which greatly aggravated the mass struggles of the people in these regions and countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The Johnson administration forced American youth to go to Vietnam to die, which caused a growing movement of American people against the war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. imperialism's barbaric colonial war in Vietnam has also aroused universal opposition from all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples in the world.
    In short, the result of the continuous expansion and strengthening of the invasion of Vietnam by the U.S. imperialism has completely gone against its wishes. Sixteen years have passed, and U.S. imperialism has not only failed to achieve its goal of conquering and enslaving the Vietnamese people, but on the contrary, the wider the scope of its aggression, the more people who are involved in the anti-American struggle; the more brutal the means of aggression, the stronger the resistance it arouses; the longer the time of aggression drags on, the more unfavorable the situation of the United States becomes.
    The U.S. monopoly capitalist groups live by aggression and war. Without aggression and war, their lives will come to an end. U.S. imperialism not only launched a war of aggression in Vietnam, but also extended its aggressive claws to every corner of the world. At present, it maintains more than 2,200 military bases and military facilities abroad and has sent more than one million invading troops overseas. It controls, interferes, invades, or threatens almost all countries in the world. The result of U.S. imperialism's actions, like the consequences of its aggression against Vietnam, has played a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against U.S. imperialism. This naturally promotes the mutual support and assistance of the people of all countries in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own demise"; "Imperialism is driving the masses of the people of the world to embark on the historical era of the great struggle to eliminate imperialism." One day, the people of all countries will put the heinous U.S. imperialism to the gallows.
    The Chinese people have always believed that the victory of the Vietnamese people in the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a great assistance to our people. We have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation as an unshirkable internationalist duty of the Chinese people. We will continue to unreservedly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against the American aggressors until they achieve final victory.

### 坚决支持越南人民打败美国侵略者

    坚决支持越南人民打败美国侵略者
    今年三月十九日，是越南全国反美斗争日十六周年。三月十二日至十九日，是全世界人民“声援越南人民周”。中国人民以极其兴奋的心情，回顾十六年来越南人民同美帝国主义进行的英勇卓越的斗争，对兄弟的越南人民在这一伟大斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利和对世界革命事业所作出的巨大贡献，表示崇高的敬意。
    一九五○年三月十六日，美帝国主义派遣第七舰队的两艘驱逐舰开进西贡，并从航空母舰上出动大批飞机，侵入西贡上空，用“武力示威”来威胁越南人民。美国的这一挑衅性活动，激起了越南人民的极大愤怒。三月十九日，西贡学生和市民举行声势浩大的反美游行示威，迫使美帝国主义的两艘驱逐舰在第二天就夹着尾巴逃跑。这次事件，明显地暴露出美帝国主义企图侵入越南、取代法国在越南的殖民地位的野心，也是越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的第一个胜利。
    美帝国主义在世界各地到处制造紧张，到处进行侵略。它以为这样就可以达到吓倒各国人民和奴役各国人民的目的。其实，恰恰相反，它起了动员各国人民的作用，迫使他们行动起来，进行斗争，打败美国侵略者。十六年来，越南局势的发展，生动地证明了这一点。
    从一九五○年三月十九日事件以后，美帝国主义一步步地渗入越南。一九五四年日内瓦协议签订之后，美帝国主义长驱直入地进入南越，完全取代了法国殖民者的地位。美帝国主义扶植南越傀儡政权，并且发动“特种战争”。在“特种战争”遭到失败之后，美帝国主义又派遣了大量的远征军进入南越，并悍然轰炸越南民主共和国。但结果却激发了南越人民更加深刻的民族仇恨，展开了越来越英勇顽强的战斗。南越人民武装把拥有现代化装备的美国侵略军打得落花流水，走投无路。美国空中强盗轰炸越南北方的结果，使三千一百万越南人民同仇敌忾，更加紧密地团结起来，展开全民的、伟大的抗美救国斗争。
    美帝国主义的动员作用，还不仅限于越南。约翰逊政府企图把战火扩大到整个印度支那，以挽救它在南越的败局，结果是激起了老挝人民和柬埔寨人民的坚决抗击。华盛顿驱使南朝鲜傀儡集团和澳大利亚、新西兰等仆从国家为美国侵越战争提供炮灰，利用日本和泰国作为侵越战争的前进基地，结果都大大加剧了这些地区和国家的人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的群众斗争。约翰逊政府迫使美国青年到越南送死，引起了美国人民日益高涨的反对侵越战争运动。美帝国主义在越南发动野蛮的殖民战争，还激起全世界一切爱好和平、坚持正义的国家和人民的普遍反对。
    总之，美帝国主义不断扩大和加强侵越活动的结果，完全走向它的愿望的反面。十六年过去了，美帝国主义不仅没有达到征服和奴役越南人民的目的，恰恰相反，它的侵略活动牵涉的范围愈广，卷进反美斗争洪流的人就愈多；侵略的手段愈残暴，激起的反抗就愈强烈；侵略的时间拖得愈长，美国的处境就愈加不妙。
    美国垄断资本集团是靠侵略和战争过日子的。没有侵略和战争，它们的生命也就要结束。美帝国主义不仅在越南发动侵略战争，而且还把它的侵略魔爪伸到全世界的每一个角落。目前，它在国外保有二千二百多个军事基地和军事设施，向海外派出了一百多万侵略军队。它几乎对世界所有的国家进行控制、干涉、侵略或威胁。美帝国主义这样做的结果，也象它侵略越南所造成的后果一样，起了动员全世界人民起来反对美帝国主义的作用。这就自然而然地促使各国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，互相支持，互相援助。毛泽东同志说：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件”；“帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代”。终有一天，各国人民会把罪恶滔天的美帝国主义处以绞刑。
    中国人民一向认为，越南人民反对美帝国主义斗争的胜利，是对我国人民的巨大援助。我们也一向把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，看作是我国人民义不容辞的国际主义义务。我们将毫无保留地继续支援越南人民抗击美国侵略者的正义斗争，直到他们取得最后胜利。
