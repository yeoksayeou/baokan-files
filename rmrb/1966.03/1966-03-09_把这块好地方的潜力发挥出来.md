    In our region with such good conditions, we must also have the determination and action to wholeheartedly serve the revolution and completely and thoroughly serve the people. More importantly, we must have the spirit of humility, prudence, striving for advancement, and continuous revolution.
    Unleash the Potential of This Good Place
    Xuancheng is a good place with fertile land and a suitable climate, known as "Southern Xuancheng and Northern Hefei" and a "land of fish and rice." It has neither the "three pests" of Lankao nor the seven gullies, eight ridges, poor mountains, and bad waters of Dazhai in the past. However, in recent years, Xuancheng's progress has been relatively slow. What exactly is hindering development?
    After the publication of "The County Party Secretary's Example - Jiao Yulu," I found the correct answer. This is because our county committee's leadership is not revolutionary enough, and we do not have the revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people like Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, and completely and thoroughly serving the people.
    In the past, the county committee always felt that "Xuancheng is doing well," "output is increasing every year," and "the people's living standards are improving year by year." Now we realize that this is actually a lack of ambition, standing not high enough, and seeing not far enough. In fact, Xuancheng has been living under a "bottom-of-the-pot shape," and the grain yield per mu of surrounding brother counties has exceeded ours. As the "squad leader," I have not fully realized the potential of this good place, how can I not feel ashamed and sad?
    What's the use of feeling ashamed if you don't put in hard work in action?
    Now, the comrades of the county committee resolutely express that they will learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu with practical actions. We must turn our ideological emotions into revolutionary actions.
    How exactly should Xuancheng change? First of all, we must overcome the phenomenon of "bureaucratism without investigation, clericalism in a mess, advanced experience not learned, and sticking to old ways while boasting about ourselves." In our region with such good conditions, we must also have the determination and action to wholeheartedly serve the revolution and completely and thoroughly serve the people! More importantly, we must have the spirit of humility, prudence, striving for advancement, and continuous revolution!
    Now, all cadres in our county are using learning from Jiao Yulu as a driving force to promote this year's production; using Jiao Yulu as an example to completely change the face of Xuancheng.

### 把这块好地方的潜力发挥出来

    在我们条件这样好的地区，同样要有一心为革命，完全、彻底地为人民的决心和行动，更要有谦虚、谨慎，力争上游，不断革命的精神
    把这块好地方的潜力发挥出来
    宣城是个好地方，土地肥沃，气候适宜，素称“南宣北合”“鱼米之乡”。既没有兰考的“三害”，也没有大寨过去的七沟八岭、穷山恶水。可是，近几年来，宣城前进的步伐比较慢。这究竟是什么东西阻碍发展呢？
    《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》发表以后，我找到了正确的答案。这是因为，我们县委领导革命化不够，没有象毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄那样，一心为革命、一心为人民，没有完全、彻底地为人民服务的革命精神。
    以前，县委总觉得“宣城搞得不错”“产量每年都在上升”“人民生活水平也在逐年改善”。现在认识到，这实际是没有雄心壮志，站得不高，看得不远。事实上，宣城已在“锅底形”下过日子了，周围兄弟县粮食亩产都超过了我们。身为“班长”的我，没有把这块好地方的潜力充分发挥出来，怎么不叫人感到惭愧、感到难过呢？
    不在行动上下硬功夫，惭愧有什么用？
    现在，县委同志坚决表示，要以实际行动，来向焦裕禄同志学习，我们一定要将思想上的感动，变为革命的行动。
    宣城究竟怎么改变？这首先要克服“官僚主义不调查，事务主义乱如麻，先进经验不学习，墨守陈规还自夸”的现象。在我们条件这样好的地区同样要有一心为革命、完全、彻底地为人民服务的决心和行动！更要有谦虚、谨慎，力争上游，不断革命的精神！
    现在，我们全县干部，以学习焦裕禄为动力，来推动今年生产；以焦裕禄为榜样，彻底改变宣城面貌。
