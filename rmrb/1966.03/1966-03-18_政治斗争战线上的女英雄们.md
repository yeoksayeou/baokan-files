　　Political struggle's main force

　　In South Vietnam, those who are engaging in heroic struggle against the vicious US-puppet clique include not only the powerful Liberation Army and guerrillas armed with weapons, but also a broad mass political struggle force wielding only bare hands. The main force of this team is women, rural women and urban women. They are not afraid of strong enemies, dare to fight, and rely on justice, courage, determination and wit to launch increasingly powerful political struggles, heavily hitting and disintegrating the enemy, and powerfully cooperating and supporting the armed struggle.

　　Whether in the central plains or in the southern plains, we often see or hear about this mighty political struggle. In this struggle team, there are gray-haired old mothers, young women with babies in their arms, and teenage girls. Some struggle teams have only dozens or hundreds of people, while others have thousands or tens of thousands. Sometimes they hold up large banners against the American aggressors, and sometimes they lead cattle, carry pots, carry loads, and push carts to fight in enemy-occupied cities, in enemy strongholds, at the enemy's doorstep, on the highways, and in "strategic hamlets." Sometimes, they hold hands tightly, using their bodies to block the vehicles of the US-puppet troops, fighting against the muzzles of the US-puppet troops. Wherever there are US-puppet troops, there are their struggles. Sometimes, the struggle team encounters armed suppression by the enemy, and they also heroically persist in the struggle amidst dense gunfire. Sometimes they fight for a day, sometimes for several days in a row. These powerful political struggles expose the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, mobilize and organize the masses, win over puppet soldiers, and sometimes even block enemy "sweeps," leaving the enemy stunned and helpless.

　　Here—in the suburbs of Saigon, we not only hear the dense gunfire of the Liberation Armed Forces annihilating the enemy every day, but also often hear the roar of women's political struggles. Women in Cu Chi district, northwest of Saigon, have acted time and time again, their teams mighty, rushing towards the enemy like a raging wave. Holding up signs reading "Down with the American robbers" and "American aggressors get out of South Vietnam," they rushed towards the US-puppet troops and strongholds on Highway 1. Despite the appearance of enemy planes overhead, threatening the demonstrating masses, the team continued to move forward, waving their fists at the American flying bandits.

　　One of millions of times

　　This is one of millions of political struggles.

　　More than two thousand women from various villages in Cu Chi district broke through the obstruction of the puppet troops and gathered in front of the stronghold.

　　"Stop!" A rogue named Lao Zhen jumped out of the puppet army, fired two shots into the sky, and shouted: "If you don't stop, I'll shoot!"

　　"Are you a monster?" A fifty-year-old Mother Ba rushed out of the struggle team. She was very calm and composed, and walked towards the rogue, asking him: "Do you have a mother? Do you dare to hit our mothers?"

　　"I'll shoot if I want to shoot." The rogue pointed his gun at Mother Ba.

　　"You dare!" The masses immediately surrounded him from all directions. The rogue glanced at the angry masses, lowered his head, and didn't dare to say a word.

　　At this time, a puppet soldier squeezed over, with a smile on his face, and said: "Folks, our commander is not here, it's not easy to handle! If you have anything to say, say it and go back."

　　"Of course, we have something to say. Call your commander out, call the American devils out!" Mother Ba said loudly.

　　A long time passed, and a helicopter landed in the stronghold. Soon, the puppet district chief of Cu Chi, looking very imposing, walked out of the gate of the stronghold, climbed onto the hood of a car, and squinted at the masses.

　　As soon as the two thousand masses heard that the puppet district chief had arrived, they shouted slogans: "Down with the American aggressors" and "Oppose the American planes' indiscriminate bombing!" They swarmed up and surrounded the car on which the puppet district chief was standing.

　　Seeing the struggling masses swarming up, the puppet district chief was immediately stunned. He stared at the masses in astonishment, and emboldened himself and said: "I already know about your affairs. Haven't I said it many times? I told you to enter the New Life Village (this is the new name given by the US-puppet troops to 'strategic hamlets'), but you refused to come, and insisted on being with the Viet Cong. Now that you've been bombed, what can be done!"

　　"The American devils bombed us, you lured us, the American devils can't bomb us down, do you think you can fool us? Dream on!" Auntie Mo pointed at the puppet district chief and scolded loudly.

　　"Aren't you here now?" The puppet district chief pretended not to hear and continued: "You've brought your children and belongings, good! I'll prepare places for you to build houses, and give each family American milk and American flour!"

　　Auntie Hui stepped out and questioned the puppet district chief: "Stop talking nonsense, you first answer us, who bombed us?"

　　"Who?" The crowd responded in unison, crowding up and waving their fists: "The American robbers, the American robbers!"

　　"You tell me, who started the war?" The puppet district chief smiled proudly at his rhetorical question, "It's the Viet Cong! The Americans are helping us fight the Viet Cong."

　　"Nonsense! Are you blind, who is running rampant on our country's land? It's the American robbers! Who is destroying our crops and killing our people? It's the American devils!" A young woman stood up in the struggle team, she waved her arms vigorously, and said loudly. As soon as she finished speaking, the struggling masses were immediately enraged, and erupted in an avalanche-like cry: "Down with the American devils!" "Down with! Down with!" "American imperialism get out!" "Get out! Get out!"

　　"Don't shout, don't argue!" The puppet district chief was afraid that the struggle masses would make too much noise, and immediately said: "I will convey your requests to the Americans."

　　"We are not here to ask for anything, we are the masters of the southern land, if US imperialism does not stop its aggression for one day, we will not stop the struggle for one day!" A woman said firmly.

　　"Oppose the American devils' indiscriminate bombing!" Mother Ba led the way in shouting slogans.

　　"Oh, my old grandma, you are really amazing." In the surrounded crowd of struggling people, the puppet district chief was completely like a headless fly.

　　A puppet officer rushed over, pushing the women in front of him, screaming, "If you shout loudly again, I'll lock you all up and shoot you!"

　　"Go ahead, if you dare!"

　　"Lock us up, three days, five days, one year, ten years, we are not afraid!"

　　"Down with US imperialism!" "Down with! Down with! Down with!" Another burst of shouts cut through the clear sky.

　　The puppet district chief's face turned pale, and while staggering off the car, he was still saying: "Arrest whoever is leading!"

　　"The American devils organized us to come!"

　　"You have been influenced by Viet Cong propaganda." The puppet district chief shouted, retreating to the gate of the stronghold.

　　"We are rural women, but we can tell right from wrong better than you literate fools."

　　"..." The puppet district chief was speechless, turned his head and slipped into the stronghold. Seeing the puppet district chief running away, the struggling masses immediately boiled up again. The slogan shouted in unison resounded through the clouds: "'District Chief' has run away." "Down with the American aggressors!"

　　After the women fought down the puppet district chief, they divided into several groups and went to nearby small towns, to the highways, found passing masses, and stopped the passing puppet military vehicles, and told the puppet soldiers about the crimes of the US military destroying their hometowns. Some puppet soldiers listened to the accusations of the masses and whispered: "The American devils are hateful, we also hate them, you fight!" The demonstrating masses stopped civilian vehicles coming from Saigon. Some passengers from Saigon got out of the car to listen to the accusations of the masses. Saigon citizens said: "The American devils' B-52 bombers have bombed to the gate of Saigon, which proves that their end is near." Some masses in small towns also sent rice and bread to the struggle team.

　　Unity is strength

　　Mother Ba and Mother Hui and other five old mothers have walked the road paved with blood and tears. They have been tortured and arrested by the US-puppet troops. Scars can be found on each of them, but a trace of pessimistic shadow can never be found on their faces. From their life-and-death struggles, they firmly believe in the truth that revolutionary struggle will win.

　　"We women have our own struggle posts." Mother Ba sat on the edge of the bamboo bed and said to us kindly: "We understand that liberation, independence, and peace are not gifts from heaven, but only rely on our own struggle."

　　"We are not afraid of anything, we fight the enemy face to face with bare hands, we have organized ourselves and improved ourselves in the struggle. Now it is not that we are afraid of the enemy with guns, but the enemy with guns is afraid of us." Mother Hui continued.

　　Mother Mo said: "We unite, organize, and attack the armed offensives and political offensives of the US-puppet clique. The more we fight, the stronger we become. We are masses with revolutionary consciousness, organized masses, this is a powerful force, which no enemy can destroy or defeat!"

　　"We are proud to participate in the struggle against the enemy. Our struggle is not only for our generation, but also for our next generation. In the future they will say: Our grandmothers are grandmothers who dare to fight, our mothers are mothers who dare to win. We use our own actions to set an example: No liberation, no independence, rather death."

　　How well said! Thousands of women in South Vietnam are united into one will and one heart in this common belief. Inspired by this decisive force, they stood up and fought the enemy face to face; they carried guns to join the guerrillas to attack the enemy, and destroy "strategic hamlets"; they dug traps, sharpened stakes, laid landmines, and shouldered the heavy responsibility of deploying combat villages; they raised and educated the next generation in air-raid shelters and artillery fortifications; they filled in bomb craters and planted seeds amidst the whistling of artillery shells; they also seized harvests in the midst of the American planes spreading poison and dropping napalm bombs.

　　Seeing all this, hearing all this, we remembered what Nguyen Thi Dinh, deputy commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and president of the South Vietnam Liberation Women's Federation, told us: "Our South Vietnamese women are staunch and unyielding. In the long struggle, the suffering they have experienced is indescribable. However, no matter in prison, under the enemy's butcher knife, or in the face of the enemy's sweet words, our women never succumb."

　　At the beginning of this year, women from Di'an-Xin'an Province went to the enemy-occupied stronghold to conduct political struggle. The slogan reads: Stop the American robbers and their running dogs from slaughtering the people with artillery.

### 政治斗争战线上的女英雄们

    政治斗争战线上的女英雄们
    政治斗争中的主力
    在越南南方，同凶恶的美伪集团进行英勇斗争的，不仅有手持武器的强大的解放军和游击队，而且还有一支赤手空拳的广泛的群众性的政治斗争队伍。这支队伍的主力是妇女，农村的妇女和城市的妇女。她们不畏强敌，敢于斗争，凭着正义、勇气、坚定和机智，展开日益强大的政治斗争，沉重打击和瓦解敌人，有力地配合和支援了武装斗争。
    不论在中部平原地区，或者在南部平原地区，我们都经常亲眼看到或听人谈到这种声势浩大的政治斗争。在这个斗争队伍里，有白发苍苍的老妈妈，有怀抱婴儿的青年妇女，还有十多岁的小姑娘。有的斗争队伍只有几十个人、百十来人，有的有成千上万的人。她们有时高举大幅反对美国侵略者的标语，有时牵牛携锅，挑担推车，到敌占区的城市里去斗，到敌人据点里去斗，到敌人家门口去斗，到公路上去斗，到“战略村”里去斗。有时，她们一个个紧挽着双手，用自己的身子挡住美伪军的车辆，顶着美伪军的枪口斗。哪里有美伪军，哪里就有她们的斗争。有时，斗争队伍遇到了敌人的武装镇压，她们也英勇地在密集的枪声中，坚持斗争。有时斗一天，有时一连斗好几天。这些强有力的政治斗争，揭露了美帝国主义的侵略罪行，动员组织了群众，争取了伪军士兵，有时还挡住了敌人的“扫荡”，使得敌人愕然失色，束手无策。
    在这里——西贡市郊，我们不仅每天听到解放武装歼敌的密集枪声，而且还经常听到妇女们政治斗争的怒吼声。西贡市西北的古芝县妇女就一次又一次地行动起来，她们的队伍浩浩荡荡，象滚滚巨浪冲向敌人。她们高举着“打倒美国强盗”、“美国侵略者滚出南越”的标语牌，冲向一号公路上的美伪军中和据点去。尽管头顶上出现了敌机，威胁着示威群众，但是队伍继续前进，她们对着美国飞贼挥舞着双拳。
    千万次中的一次
    这是千万次政治斗争中的一次。
    古芝县各乡的两千多名妇女，冲破了伪军的拦阻，汇集到据点门前。
    “站住！”伪军中跳出一个名叫老真的恶棍，举枪朝天“叭叭”打了两枪，大声叱喝：“再不停住，我要开枪了！”
    “你是不是怪物？”斗争队伍里冲出一个五十多岁的巴妈妈，她十分镇静沉着，健步迎向恶棍，问他：“你有没有母亲？你敢打我们母亲？”
    “我想开枪就开枪。”恶棍把枪口对着巴妈妈。
    “你敢打！”群众立刻从四面八方包围过来。恶棍斜着眼望望愤怒的群众，低下头，一句话也不敢说了。
    这时，挤过来一个伪军，脸上堆着笑容说：“乡亲们，我们的长官不在，不好办哪！你们有话说吧，说完回去。”
    “当然，有话要说。叫你们长官出来，叫美国鬼子出来！”巴妈妈大声说。
    时间过了很久，一架直升飞机降落到据点里。不久，古芝县伪县长神气活现地走出据点大门，爬上汽车车盖，眯眼望着群众。
    两千多群众一听说伪县长来了，高呼口号：“打倒美国侵略者”、“反对美国飞机狂轰滥炸！”她们一拥而上，把伪县长站着的汽车包围住了。
    伪县长眼见斗争群众蜂拥上来，立刻呆住了。他惊愕地瞅着群众，壮了壮胆说：“你们的事，我已经知道了。我不是已经说过多少次了吗？叫你们进新生村（这是美伪军对“战略村”的新称呼），你们偏不来，偏要同越共在一起，现在挨了炸，那又有什么办法！”
    “美国鬼子炸我们，你诱骗我们，美国鬼子炸不倒我们，你想骗倒我们吗？做梦！”茉大妈手指着伪县长，高声怒斥。
    “现在你们不是来了吗？”伪县长装作没听见的样子，接着说：“孩子、什物都带来了，好啊！我给你们准备地方盖房子，每家发给美国牛奶，美国面粉！”
    慧大妈闪出来向伪县长质问：“别瞎扯，你先回答我们，是谁炸了我们？”
    “是谁？”人群一齐响应，拥上来，挥动拳头：“美国强盗，美国强盗！”
    “你们说，谁发动了战争？”伪县长为自己的反问得意地笑了，“是越共！美国人帮我们打越共。”
    “胡说！你没有长眼睛，是谁在我们祖国土地上横行霸道？是美国强盗！是谁炸毁我们的庄稼，杀害我们人民？是美国鬼子！”斗争队伍中站起了一个年青的妇女，她使劲地挥动胳臂，大声说。她的话音刚落，斗争群众立刻激怒了，爆发出山崩似的呼声：“打倒美国鬼子！”“打倒！打倒！”“美帝国主义滚出去！”“滚出去！滚出去！”
    “别嚷，别吵！”伪县长害怕斗争群众闹大了，立刻说：“我把你们的请求转告美国人。”
    “我们不是来请求，我们是南方土地的主人，美帝国主义一天不停止侵略，我们一天不停止斗争！”一个妇女斩钉截铁地说。
    “反对美国鬼子狂轰滥炸！”巴妈妈领头高呼口号。
    “哎呀，我的老奶奶，你们真厉害。”伪县长在包围的斗争人群里，完全象个摘了头的苍蝇。
    一个伪军官冲过来了，他推着面前的妇女，嘶叫着，“你们再高声呼喊，统统把你们关起来，枪毙你们！”
      “打吧，你敢！”
    “关吧，三天，五天，一年，十年，我们都不怕！”
      “打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒！打倒！打倒！”又是一阵吼声划破晴空。
    伪县长顿时脸孔苍白，一边踉跄地跳下了汽车，一边还在说：“谁领头，抓起来！”
    “美国鬼子组织我们来的！”
      “你们受了越共的宣传。”伪县长叫嚷着退到据点门边。
      “我们是农村妇女，可比你这识字的蠢才能分辨好坏。”
    “……”伪县长说不出话来，转头就朝据点里溜。斗争的群众眼见伪县长逃跑了，立刻又沸腾起来。齐声高呼的口号声响遏行云：“‘县长’逃跑了。”“打倒美国侵略者！”
    妇女们斗倒了伪县长之后，又分几路，到附近的各个小镇上，到公路上，找过路群众，把来往的伪军军车拦住，对伪军诉说了美军破坏家乡的罪行。有的伪军听了群众的控诉，小声答道：“美国鬼子是可恶，我们也恨他们，你们斗吧！”示威群众拦住了西贡开来的民用车辆。车上的西贡乘客，有的下车来听群众的控诉。西贡市民说：“美国鬼子的B—52型轰炸机炸到西贡大门口了，这证明他们的末日快到了。”一些小镇上的群众还把大米饭和面包送给斗争队伍。
        团结起来就是力量
    巴妈妈和慧大妈等五位老大妈，是踩着血和泪的路走过来的。她们被美伪军拷打过，逮捕过。从她们每个人的身上都可以找到伤痕，但是从她们的脸上却永远找不到一丝悲观的阴影。她们从生死斗争中坚信革命斗争必胜的真理。
      “我们妇女有自己的斗争岗位。”巴妈妈坐在竹床沿上，亲切地望着我们说：“我们懂得，解放、独立、和平，不是天赐的，只有靠自己斗争。”
      “我们什么也不怕，我们赤手空拳同敌人面对面斗争，我们在斗争中组织了自己，提高了自己。现在不是我们怕持枪的敌人，而是持枪的敌人怕我们。”慧大妈接着说。
    茉大妈说：“我们团结起来，组织起来，进攻美伪集团武装的进攻，政治的进攻。我们越斗越强。我们是有革命觉悟的群众，是有组织的群众，这是一支强大的力量，是任何敌人也摧不毁，打不垮的！
    “我们为自己参加对敌斗争而自豪。我们的斗争，不仅为了我们这一代，也为了我们的下一代。将来他们会说：我们的祖母是敢于斗争的祖母，我们的母亲是敢于胜利的母亲。我们用自己的行动作出榜样：不解放，不独立，毋宁死。”
    这话说得多好啊！南方成千成万的妇女，正是在这个共同的信念中凝结成了一个意志，一条心。在这种决战决胜的力量的鼓舞下，她们挺身而起，面对面的同敌人展开斗争；她们扛起枪参加游击队打击敌人，破坏“战略村”；她们挖陷阱，削尖桩，埋地雷，担负着战斗村布防的重任；她们在防空防炮工事里抚养和教育着下一代；她们在炮弹呼啸中填平弹坑下种；她们又在美机撒毒药、扔凝固汽油弹中抢收庄稼。
    看到这一切，听到这一切，我们想起了越南南方解放武装力量副司令、越南南方解放妇女联合会会长阮氏定对我们说的一句话：“我们南方妇女是坚贞不屈的，在漫长的斗争中，她们所经历的苦难是难以形容的。但是，不管在监狱里，在敌人的屠刀下，在敌人的花言巧语面前，我们妇女是从不屈服的。”
