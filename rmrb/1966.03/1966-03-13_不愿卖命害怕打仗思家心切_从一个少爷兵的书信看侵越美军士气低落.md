　　Unwilling to Risk Their Lives, Afraid of Fighting, Homesick
　　From a Letter of a Young Master Soldier Showing the Low Morale of American Troops Invading Vietnam
　　The American *New York Times* published on the 6th excerpts of letters written by U.S. Marine Corps Private First Class Richard Marx to his mother and friends before his death.

　　Richard Marx was sent to Vietnam to fight in April last year, and in February this year he became a victim of the American imperialist war machine, dying at the age of nineteen. This is also the common fate of many American soldiers invading Vietnam.

　　Below are excerpts from some of his letters:

　　April 24, 1965, from Okinawa: "Well! Everything became clear yesterday. It turns out that two companies of the sister battalion were almost annihilated by the Viet Cong. I am finally beginning to realize that Vietnam is not to be trifled with. Some of the guys who were on the same ship with me a week ago are now dead. At first I was sad, then angry, and finally I was scared—and I’m still scared.

　　"We are scheduled to leave next Monday, and I will be in Vietnam on Wednesday. That means contact next Friday. I am not looking forward to that day.

　　"I have been assigned to an M-60 machine gun team, and I don't know anything about machine guns..."

　　July, from South Vietnam: "(He received notice that he would have to stay in Vietnam for another nine months.) I'm going crazy. So far, six Marines in our battalion have gone crazy, and one Navy engineer has also gone crazy. It's unbearable to stay in this place."

　　July 30, from Phu Bai, South Vietnam: "They (the Liberation Army) probe our defenses every night and throw grenades. There is a lot of wind and rain, and it is extremely difficult to hear them moving in the bushes—it is obviously even more difficult to see them. Soon, one day, the Viet Cong will concentrate their forces to knock out our outposts and then try to destroy the airport we are guarding."

　　August 15, in ××: "My whole body has been aching, and I always feel tired. (He has lost thirty pounds.)

　　"(His mother told him that she had written to a senator, worrying about her son in South Vietnam.) Don't write such letters anymore—okay? There are 45,000 other Marines here besides me. They are standing guard, patrolling, losing pounds, having chills and fever, encountering battles, and many of them will never see home again."

　　× month × day in ××: "They (the Liberation Army) probably want to drive us away in the next few nights. It's dark now, and we are watching the artillery fire around the area—it's a terrible but beautiful picture."

　　February 5, 1966: "I just came back from patrol today, this patrol lasted six days and seven nights... I was scared to death every moment there... Today I am glad I am still alive."

　　× month × day in Da Nang: "All the helicopters have been transferred away, so our patrol today—which required helicopters—has also been cancelled, thank goodness! I thought I would get a Purple Heart (the mark of a wounded soldier) after this patrol."

　　"(The day to go home is coming soon.) Please count me in on all the celebrations for returning home."

　　February 14, near Da Nang: (An amphibious tractor triggered a landmine, and he was sitting in the vehicle at the time.)

### 不愿卖命害怕打仗思家心切  从一个少爷兵的书信看侵越美军士气低落

    不愿卖命害怕打仗思家心切
    从一个少爷兵的书信看侵越美军士气低落
    美国《纽约时报》六日发表了美国海军陆战队一等兵理查德·马克斯生前写给他母亲和朋友的书信片段。
    理查德·马克斯是在去年四月被送到越南打仗的，今年二月他就成为美帝国主义战争机器的牺牲品，死时才十九岁。这也是许许多多侵越美兵的共同命运。
    下面是他的一些书信的片断：
    一九六五年四月二十四日，发自冲绳：“嗯！昨天一切都明白了。原来姐妹营的两个连几乎都被越共歼灭。我终于开始认识到越南不是好惹的。一个礼拜前和我同船的几个家伙现在都死了。起初我很伤心，接着是气愤，最后我感到害怕——直到现在还害怕。
      “我们预定在下星期一出发，星期三我就要到越南了。那就是说下星期五就要接触。我不指望这一天到来。
      “我被派到一个M—60机枪组，而我对于机枪是一窍不通……”
    七月，发自南越：“（他得到了还要在越南呆九个月的通知。）我要发疯了。到目前为止，我们营已经有六个海军陆战队员发疯了，还有一个海军工兵也发疯了。要在这个地方继续呆下去，真是受不了。”
    七月三十日，发自南越的芙拜：“他们（解放军）每天晚上都刺探我们的防线并且投掷手榴弹。风声雨声很大，要听到他们在灌木丛走动的声音是极端困难的——要看到他们显然还要困难得多。很快总有一天越共将集结兵力拔掉我们的前哨，然后设法摧毁我们守卫着的机场。”
    八月十五日在××：“浑身筋骨一直在发疼，我总是感到疲倦。（他的体重掉了三十磅。）
    “（他的母亲告诉他说，她曾经写信给一位参议员，为她在南越的儿子担心。）别再写这样的信啦——好吗？这里除我以外还有四万五千名海军陆战队员。他们在站岗、巡逻、掉磅、发寒热、遭遇战斗，他们当中有许许多多的人将再也看不到老家了。”
    ×月×日在××：“他们（解放军）大概想在今后几个夜晚把我们赶开。现在天黑了，我们在了望周围地区的炮火——真是一幅可怕而又美丽的图画。”
      一九六六年二月五日：“今天我刚刚巡逻回来，这次巡逻搞了六天七夜……在那里我无时无刻不害怕得要死……今天我庆幸自己还活着。”
   ×月×日在岘港：“全部直升飞机都调走了，因此，我们今天的巡逻——它需要用直升飞机——也取消了，谢天谢地！我本以为在这次巡逻以后会得到一块紫心章（伤兵的标记）。”
      “（回老家的日子快到了。）在一切庆祝回乡的活动中，请把我也算进去。”
    二月十四日在岘港附近：（一辆水陆两栖牵引车触发一颗地雷，当时他正坐在车上。）
