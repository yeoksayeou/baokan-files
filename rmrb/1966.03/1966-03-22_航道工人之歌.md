    Song of the Navigation Workers
    Buoy tenders, buoy tenders, truly heroic, sailing small boats, braving the wind and waves, speeding beneath steep cliffs, traveling amidst raging waves. Daring to reach out and pluck stars from the Milky Way, daring to go into the sea and catch dragons. Revolutionary enthusiasm surges like waves, loudly singing "The East is Red."
    Signalmen, signalmen, utterly loyal, strictly guarding their posts like sentries, with a red heart turned towards the Party, taking root in a small hut. Signals are accurate and timely, directing vessels to advance, the work is ordinary but the responsibility is heavy, becoming a shining screw. Our workers have high aspirations, our workers have high aspirations, with unwavering loyalty for the waterways. Conquering dangerous shoals and turbulent waters, ensuring safety and quality. Surging through a thousand layers of waves, carving out a path; allowing passing vessels to proceed without obstruction, songs floating on the river. Hey hey! Songs floating on the river!
  〔Collective creation by workers of the Fengjie Navigation Section of the Yangtze River Shipping Company〕

    航道工人之歌
    航标员航标员，真英勇，驾小艇破浪乘风，疾驰于峭壁之下，行走在恶浪之中。敢伸手摘银河星，敢下海去捉蛟龙。革命热情如浪涌，高声歌唱《东方红》。
    信号工信号员忠心耿耿，严守岗位如哨兵，一颗红心向着党，一间小屋扎下根。信号正确又及时，指挥行轮向前进，工作平凡责任重，做颗闪光的螺丝钉。我们工人志气高我们工人志气高，赤胆忠心为航道。征服险滩与恶水，安全质量搞得好。冲破千层浪呀，劈开路一条；行轮过往无阻挡呀，歌声江上飘。嗨嗨！歌声江上飘！
  〔长江航运公司奉节航道段工人集体创作〕
