    The blood debts of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys must be repaid.
    Colombian People Angrily Demonstrate Against Murder of Torres
    Demonstrators Express Determination to Fight to the Death for the People to Seize Power
    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Bogota: A new struggle by the Colombian people against the pro-U.S. government's bloody suppression of the people has recently spread to four provinces. This new wave of struggle was triggered by the military authorities' announcement of the news that the prominent Colombian figure Camilo Torres had been killed by government troops.
    Camilo Torres, formerly a priest, was one of the leaders of the Colombian "United Front Movement." He joined the Colombian National Liberation Army, which is currently engaged in armed struggle, two months ago.
    In the capital, Bogota (Cundinamarca Province), workers, university students, and professionals have been continuously holding marches and protest rallies since February 17th. Demonstrators have repeatedly fought with fully armed military police who came to suppress them, using stones against their tear gas, cavalry, and bayonets. In one of the clashes, demonstrators burned a car belonging to the American "Sears Roebuck" company and attacked military vehicles with stones.
    On February 23rd, more than 10,000 residents of Bogota held a memorial gathering for Camilo Torres. Angry crowds burned a military vehicle and threw stones at official vehicles. The gathering was brutally suppressed by a large number of police and troops. It is estimated that more than one hundred people, including many women, were injured and trampled by police sabers and horses' hooves.
    In Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca Province, five thousand university students, workers, and intellectuals also held a fierce demonstration march to protest the authorities' murder of Camilo Torres. Demonstrators carried placards with slogans such as "Fight to the death for the people to seize power," marching through the main streets of the city.
    At the same time, some Colombian trade unions and student organizations also issued statements strongly condemning the pro-U.S. government's atrocities. A statement by the COTELCO workers' union called on the Colombian working class, peasants, students, and people of all other strata to form a "common struggle front to overthrow the already rotten structure." The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the people of all countries and also the main enemy of the Colombian people.

    美帝国主义及其走狗的血债一定要偿还
    哥伦比亚人民愤怒示威抗议杀害托雷斯
    示威者表示要为人民掌握政权战斗到死
    据新华社一日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚人民反对亲美政府血腥镇压人民的新的斗争最近已经扩展到了四个省。这次新的斗争浪潮是由于军事当局公布的关于哥伦比亚著名人士卡米洛·托雷斯已经被政府军杀害的消息引起的。
    卡米洛·托雷斯过去是一位神父，是哥伦比亚“统一战线运动”领导人之一，他在两个月以前参加了正在进行武装斗争的哥伦比亚民族解放军。
    在首都波哥大（孔迪纳马卡省），工人、大学生和自由职业者从二月十七日以来不断举行游行和抗议集会。示威群众一再同前来镇压的全副武装的军警进行搏斗，用石头对付他们的催泪弹、马队和刺刀。在其中的一次冲突中，示威者烧毁了美国“西尔斯·罗伯克”公司的一辆汽车，并用石块袭击军用车辆。
    二月二十三日，波哥大一万多居民还举行悼念卡米洛·托雷斯的集会。愤怒的群众烧毁了一辆军用车，并用石块投扔官方车辆。集会群众遭到大批警察和军队的残酷镇压。据估计，包括许多妇女在内的一百多人被警察的马刀和马蹄砍伤和踩伤。
    在考卡山谷省省会卡利市，五千名大学生、工人和知识分子也举行了激烈的示威游行，抗议当局杀害卡米洛·托雷斯。示威群众高举“为人民掌握政权战斗到死”的标语牌，走过这座城市的各条主要街道。
    与此同时，哥伦比亚一些工会和学生组织也发表声明，强烈谴责亲美政府的暴行。科泰黑尔公司工人工会的声明号召哥伦比亚工人阶级、农民、学生及其他各阶层人民组成“共同斗争阵线，打倒已经腐朽的结构”。声明指出，美帝国主义是各国人民的主要敌人，也是哥伦比亚人民的主要敌人。
