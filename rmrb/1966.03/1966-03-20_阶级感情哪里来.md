    Where Does Class Feeling Come From
    When learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu’s deeds, people cannot forget the scene of him leading the county committee members to the train station to see the disaster-stricken masses on that snowy night. He said: “We should feel ashamed and pained if we cannot lead them to overcome the disaster…” People cannot forget that in the most difficult days, he walked into the poorest and lowest thatched cottage of poor peasant Wang Lianbei, and said to a cadre who came with him: “Seeing the suffering of our class brothers, my heart is like being cut by a knife.” What a noble class feeling! It was precisely because of this strong class feeling that he made the great aspiration to not rest in peace until the face of Lankao was changed. What kind of feeling do we have when we see the difficulties and suffering of the masses? Is it feeling restless and “heart like being cut by a knife,” or is it indifference and apathy?
    People often use “flesh and blood” and “brotherly affection” to describe the close feelings between people. However, in the old society, there could not be any real feelings even between father and son in a family. Marx wrote in "The Communist Manifesto": "The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation." Saying "It has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment'."
    From Comrade Jiao Yulu’s deeds, we see a brand-new relationship between people, we see the most noble and deepest feelings for class brothers, this is our proletariat's unique class feeling. This feeling inspires people’s revolutionary will and becomes a powerful driving force for every revolutionary to fight for the cause of the class!
    This deep class feeling comes from a high level of class consciousness. There is absolutely no love without a cause, nor hate without a cause in the world. This love is the class love of the proletariat. Whether a person can love the people, serve the people, and be full of deep class feeling for the people also reflects whether a person has truly established a proletarian world view.
    Is the class feeling for the people deep, or has it faded? The questions raised by Comrade Deng Hongyu and others are indeed worthy of deep thought by every revolutionary.

### 阶级感情哪里来

    阶级感情哪里来
    学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，人们不能忘记那风雪之夜，他领着县委委员到火车站去看受灾群众的情景。他说：“我们不能领导他们战胜灾荒，应该感到羞耻和痛心……”人们不能忘记那最困难的日子，他走进贫农王连备那最破最低的茅屋中，对他同来的一个干部说：“看到自己的阶级弟兄生活困苦，心象刀剜。”这是多么崇高的阶级感情！正是因为有了这种强烈的阶级感情，他才立下了不改变兰考面貌死不瞑目的宏愿。我们看到群众的困难和疾苦是怎样一种感情呢？是感到坐卧不安，“心如刀剜”。还是漠然置之，无动于衷？
    人们常常用“骨肉亲”，“手足情”来形容人们之间的亲切感情。但是，在旧社会，就是家庭父子之间也不可能有什么真正的感情。马克思在《共产党宣言》里写道：“资产阶级撕下了罩在家庭关系上的温情脉脉的面纱，把这种关系变成了纯粹的金钱关系。”说“它使人和人之间除了赤裸裸的利害关系，除了冷酷无情的‘现金交易’，就再也没有任何别的联系了。”
    从焦裕禄同志的事迹里，我们看到了一种人与人之间的崭新的关系，看到了一种对阶级兄弟最崇高、最深挚的感情，这是我们无产阶级特有的阶级感情。这种感情激发着人的革命意志，成为每个革命者为阶级事业而战斗的强大动力！
    这种深厚的阶级感情，来源于高度的阶级觉悟。世界上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。这个爱，是无产阶级的阶级爱。一个人能不能爱人民，为人民，对人民是否充满深厚的阶级感情，也就反映了一个人是否真正树立了无产阶级的世界观。
    对人民群众的阶级感情是深厚了，还是淡漠了？邓洪玉等同志提出的问题，确是值得每个革命者深深思索。
