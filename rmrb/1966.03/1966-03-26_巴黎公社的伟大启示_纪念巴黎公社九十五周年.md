    The Great Revelation of the Paris Commune
    ——Commemorating the 95th Anniversary of the Paris Commune
    Zheng Zhisizi
    《Red Flag》Editor's Note: It is the 95th anniversary of the great Paris Commune uprising. This issue of our journal publishes the commemorative article "The Great Revelation of the Paris Commune."
    The most fundamental principle of the Paris Commune is to seize political power through revolutionary violence, smash the bourgeois state machine, and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whether to adhere to this principle or betray it has always been the fundamental difference between Marxists and opportunists and revisionists.
    The principle of the Paris Commune was revealed by Marx and Engels in their summary of the experiences and lessons of the Commune, and it is the fundamental principle of the proletarian revolution. Old revisionists such as Bernstein and Kautsky betrayed this principle and degenerated into slaves of the imperialist bourgeoisie. Lenin waged an irreconcilable struggle against the old revisionists, defended the principle of the Commune, and led the Russian people to achieve the great victory of the October Revolution. The road of the October Revolution is the continuation and development of the road of the Paris Commune revolution. Stalin held high the banner of Leninism, opposed all kinds of enemies of Leninism, defended the principle of the Paris Commune, and defended the fruits of the October Revolution.
    After Stalin's death, the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the CPSU and, through the 20th, 21st, and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU, thoroughly betrayed the principle of the Commune and the path of the October Revolution, implementing a complete set of thoroughgoing revisionist lines against proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This led the Soviet Union onto the path of capitalist restoration and transformed the CPSU leadership into the international center of modern revisionism.
    This is an extremely important negative experience in the history of the dictatorship of the proletariat since the Paris Commune. It tells us that if the leadership of any proletarian party abandons the principle of the Commune before seizing political power, there will be no question of leading the revolution, and it will turn itself into a traitor and a scab. After seizing political power, if it abandons the principle of the Commune, the fruits of the people's revolution will be in danger of being lost, and it will turn itself into a complete traitor and a scab, and become a slave and accomplice of imperialism.
    Why is the CPSU revisionist leading group and its followers so frantically anti-China? The fundamental reason is that the victory of the great Chinese revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has further inherited and developed the experience of the Paris Commune and the experience of the October Revolution. The Chinese Communist Party is the great standard-bearer of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and wages a resolute struggle against all traitors who abandon the principle of the Commune. Therefore, it is not surprising that these monsters and demons hate and oppose us, and it is something to be proud of.
    Today, revisiting the experiences and lessons of the Paris Commune is of great practical significance for carrying the struggle against Khrushchev revisionism through to the end and for advancing the world revolutionary movement.
      The heroic Paris Commune uprising is now ninety-five years old.
      In the past ninety-five years, the world has undergone earth-shaking changes. The cause of the Paris Commune, which was submerged in a sea of blood by the Versailles bandits, won victory in the great October Revolution under the leadership of Lenin after forty-six years. The victory of the Chinese revolution is also a victory for the principles of the Paris Commune and the road of the October Revolution.
      The Paris Commune was a great revolution of epoch-making significance. It was the first exercise in which the proletariat took up arms to overthrow the bourgeois dictatorship and establish the proletarian dictatorship, and to overthrow the capitalist system and establish the socialist system. The heroes of the Commune have left us with valuable experiences and lessons bought with blood.
      At present, at a time when the Khrushchev revisionists are verbally praising the Paris Commune but betraying the principles of the Commune in action, it is of even greater significance to promote the revolutionary traditions of the Commune and draw lessons from its experiences and lessons.
          The proletariat can only win the right to its own
    liberation by taking up arms; the first creed of
    proletarians who do not want to be slaves is to hold
    the gun tightly in their hands.
    In the 19th century, France was at the forefront of the European revolutionary movement. It was once the center of the bourgeois revolution and once the center of the proletarian revolution. From 1789 to 1871, French workers took up arms many times, and then laid down their arms or were disarmed many times. Struggle, failure, then struggle again, and failure again. After more than eighty years of long time, paid a heavy price in blood. In this way, the proletariat gradually realized that when they fantasized about fighting for their own liberation under the leadership of the bourgeoisie instead of under the conditions of defeating the bourgeoisie, the guns in their hands only played the role of fighting for the world for their enemies. Once the revolution is victorious, regardless of whether it is the bourgeois right-wing or the bourgeois left-wing in power, they all "repay" the proletariat by disarming the workers. Once the proletariat is disarmed, they completely lose their rights.
    The proletariat's right to its own liberation should be won by the proletariat itself by taking up arms and going to the battlefield. French workers gradually approached this revolutionary truth step by step. The Paris June Uprising of 1848 and the Paris Commune Uprising of 1871 were manifestations of their transformation of this revolutionary truth into revolutionary action to varying degrees. In these two uprisings, the proletariat took up arms and fought directly against their enemies, fighting for the world for their own class.
    The Paris Commune uprising was the peak of the French proletariat's struggle for its own liberation at that time, and it was also the peak of the international proletariat's struggle for its own liberation at that time. Compared with previous uprisings of French workers, this uprising had many great creations in the use of revolutionary armed forces to fight for the proletariat's own liberation rights:
    First, half a year before the uprising, they began to establish workers' armed forces, relying on guns to not only establish their own unique political organizations (the Central Committee of the Twenty Districts and the Security Committees of each district), but also establish their own unique military organizations (the workers' battalion of the National Guard and the Central Committee of the National Guard).
    Second, they resolutely withstood the threats and inducements of the bourgeois government and refused to hand over their weapons. The first demand of the first representative meeting of the National Guard was to hold the guns tightly in their hands. Varlin said: "We must never disarm without fighting... As long as we do not win one day, the struggle will not stop for one day."①
    Third, when the bourgeois government attempted to disarm the workers by force, they dared to answer counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence, and dared to launch an uprising under the conditions of bloody suppression by the reactionary government internally and strong enemy pressure externally, turning the war of plunder between the exploiting classes into a domestic revolutionary war and destroying the bourgeois state machine.
    Fourth, on the day of the victory of the uprising, they did not lay down their arms or give up power. Marx said: "The new characteristic of this revolution is that the people did not disarm themselves after the first uprising, nor did they hand over their power to a group of republican swindlers of the ruling class."②
    Fifth, after the victory of the uprising, relying on the revolutionary armed forces of the proletariat, the proletarian revolutionary dictatorship was initially established. Marx said: "The new characteristic of this revolution is that they formed the Commune, thereby holding the real leadership of this revolution in their own hands, and at the same time found a way to keep this power in the hands of the people themselves when the revolution was victorious, that is, to replace the state machine and government machine of the ruling class with their own government machine."③
    Sixth, when the uprising was nearing failure, they still bravely persisted in fighting, preferring to gloriously die in battle with guns in their hands rather than lay down their arms and live in humiliation, demonstrating the revolutionary proletariat's fearless spirit of being willing to die rather than submit.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "For thousands of years, the laboring people have been fooled and intimidated by the reactionary ruling class and have not easily realized the importance of grasping the gun."④ The heroes of the Paris Commune broke through the deception and intimidation of the reactionary ruling class and resolutely took up arms to destroy the bourgeois state machine. This was a huge progress in the cause of proletarian liberation and a new chapter worthy of great acclaim.
    The exploiting classes have always believed that they have the right to use all kinds of weapons to suppress the exploited, and that any weapon in the hands of the exploited is a crime, and taking up arms to rebel is an even more heinous crime. In order to adapt to this reactionary view, the revisionists always promote the slave philosophy of "never use weapons" to the proletariat, and tamper with a history of proletarian revolution into a history of "peaceful transition." The same is true for the Paris Commune uprising. When Kautsky talked about the Paris Commune, he vigorously rendered the election on March 28, calling the Commune a product of "national referendum" and "pure democracy." When the Khrushchev revisionists talked about the Paris Commune, they talked about the number of people who died on March 18, attempting to prove that the Commune
  "seized power without bloodshed."
    Anyone with a little common sense of Marxism-Leninism knows that every revolutionary movement has a development process. To understand this revolution, it should be viewed as a whole, and not by extracting a certain day or a certain phenomenon to generalize, and replace the general with the individual. The entire development process of the Paris Commune, from the eve of the uprising to the bloody week, was full of life-and-death struggles between revolution and counter-revolution. The large amount of blood shed by the heroes of the Commune in the armed uprising and in defending the fruits of the uprising cannot be covered up by the lies of the revisionists.
        The proletariat should adopt revolutionary means to
    seize political power, smash the bourgeois military
    bureaucratic machine, and establish the
    dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Before the Paris Commune uprising, the French political stage was very much like a revolving lantern, and the various forms of the bourgeois state power alternated rapidly in the fierce class struggle. In this way, the proletariat personally experienced that the alternation of various forms of the bourgeois state power was nothing more than the rulers transferring the ruling power from one hand to another, and from one group to another. Turning around, it is still the bourgeois ruling and exploiting the proletariat. The proletariat also personally experienced that in the process of alternating various forms of the bourgeois state power, the state machine became larger, more complete, and more ferociously enslaved workers and other working people in each new change.
    With more than eighty years of experience (1789-1871), the French proletariat gradually realized that "the political tools that enslave them cannot be used as political tools to liberate them."⑤ To achieve liberation, the proletariat must smash the bourgeois state machine, not oppose this or that manifestation of this machine, but smash the machine itself. This is how the Paris Commune insurgents acted. Marx said: "This revolution is not a revolution against any form of state power – orthodox, constitutional, republican, or imperial state power. It is a revolution against the state itself, the supernatural monster of this society, a revolution in which the people regain their social life for their own interests. It is not a revolution to transfer state power from one group of the ruling class to another, it is a revolution to smash the evil machine of this class rule itself."⑥
    After the collapse of the Second Empire, a struggle for power gradually unfolded between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In early September 1870, in order to preserve the existing state machine and prevent power from falling into the hands of the people, various factions of the bourgeoisie quickly reached an agreement and organized a new government that was beautifully called the "National Defense Government." Due to insufficient ideological and organizational preparation, it was not yet possible for the proletariat to immediately establish its own government. However, they began to establish their own political and military organizations, which increasingly became the actual power in the working-class districts of Paris and a force confronting the "National Defense Government."
    At that time, the Central Committee of the Twenty Districts and the Security Committees of each district, relying on the workers' armed forces and the masses of the people, supervised the activities of the National Defense Government and its district governments in Paris. The Security Committee of the working-class district controlled the district chief or acted on his behalf. Alago, who had served as mayor, said that the committee "is responsible for the arms and equipment, material supply, social welfare, and other work of each district" and is "the source of revolutionary enthusiasm."⑦ Count Daru said: "They arbitrarily exert pressure on the district chief to influence his decisions, take over the duties of the district chief, issue orders, inspect residences, and often carry out arrests and searches under the pretext of preventing spies."⑧
    At that time, under the supervision of the workers' battalion of the National Guard and the revolutionary masses, "the police bureau has been completely powerless, and the police chief sits there obediently, afraid of being arrested."⑨ The head of the National Defense Government, Trochu, lamented: "The streets of the city have fallen into the hands of the masses of the people, the courts have lost their function, and all institutions that maintain public order, customs, and health care have almost come to a standstill."⑩ In just a few months, the reactionary authorities replaced several police chiefs in a row in an attempt to restore police rule, but all failed.
    Obviously, from the collapse of the Second Empire to the Paris Commune uprising, there were actually two governments in Paris. This was similar to the situation of the coexistence of two regimes in Petrograd after the February Revolution in Russia in 1917.
    The Paris proletariat established a proletarian military organization to confront the bourgeois state machine, making important preparations for smashing the bourgeois state machine. On March 18, 1871, when Thiers provoked a civil war, the proletariat relied on its own armed forces to defeat Thiers' counter-revolutionary offensive and smash the bourgeois state machine.
    Based on their class instincts and political experience, the Paris Commune insurgents recognized that the standing army and officials were the two main organs of the bourgeois state machine. After the victory of the uprising, they immediately abolished these two organs. The first decree of the Commune was the "Decree on Abolishing the Standing Army and Replacing It with the National Guard." The decree stipulated: "No armed forces shall be established or transferred to Paris other than the National Guard"; "All citizens fit for service shall be incorporated into the National Guard."? The Commune disbanded the bourgeois battalion of the National Guard.
    At the same time, the Commune also stipulated in the "Decree Announcing the Invalidity of the Orders and Instructions of the Versailles Government": "The Commune is now the only power,... Employees of various social institutions must henceforth recognize that the orders or notices issued by the Versailles government or its supporters are invalid and have no legal effect.... Any official or employee who does not comply with this decree shall be immediately removed from his position."? The Commune removed the reactionary officials who remained in Paris from their positions and demanded that the general employees of the old government honestly work for the people.
    The Commune broke the old judicial organs, abolished the reactionary legal system, stipulated that judges should be elected by the people, and the Commune directly appointed the prosecutor general.
    After abolishing the material pillar of the bourgeoisie's rule over the people—the standing army—the Commune immediately set about abolishing the spiritual tools it used to rule the people, announcing the separation of church and state, abolishing religious privileges, and so on.
    In their revolutionary practice, the Paris Commune insurgents negated the erroneous propositions of Proudhonism and Blanquism on the issue of the state. They did not engage in anarchy as Proudhonism advocated, but established proletarian state organs. They did not engage in the dictatorship of a few revolutionaries as Blanquism advocated, but relied on the revolutionary initiative and activity of the proletariat to initially implement the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Why is the Paris Commune a dictatorship of the proletariat?
    First, the Commune was a revolutionary regime of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. It was produced in the armed uprising of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and was established on the basis of smashing the bourgeois state machine. During its short existence of seventy-two days, it carried out a heroic struggle against domestic and international capitalist forces. The "Declaration of the Central Committee of the National Guard Explaining the Social Essence of the Revolution of 1871" called this struggle a great struggle of "parasitic life and labor, exploitation and production fighting each other."?
    Second, the Commune was a revolutionary regime in which the proletariat was the master. Its main pillar was the workers' armed forces. "The primary condition for the dictatorship of the proletariat is the proletariat's army."? It had the widespread support of workers and their mass organizations. Its policies mostly came from the initiatives of the masses and reflected the interests of the proletariat and the working people. Its leaders were elected by the masses, accepted the supervision of the masses, and the masses could remove and recall them according to law.
    Third, the Commune was a revolutionary regime that was completely different from bourgeois parliamentarianism. In the Commune, "representative bodies still exist, but as a special institution, as a parliamentary system with a division of legislative and executive functions and with members enjoying privileges, it does not exist here."? The Commune was a working body that concurrently managed administrative and legislative affairs. The Commune Committee promulgated laws, and the committee members enforced the laws and were responsible to the committee and the people.
    Fourth, the Commune was a revolutionary regime that adhered to proletarian internationalism. "Because the Commune is not fighting for some local or narrow national task, but for the liberation of all working humanity, for the liberation of all who are harmed and insulted."? The "Summary of the Commune Election Committee" announced: "The banner of the Paris Commune is the banner of the world republic."?
    Fifth, the Commune was a revolutionary regime aimed at eliminating exploitation. "The Commune wanted to eliminate that class ownership which turns the labor of the many into the wealth of the few. It wanted to expropriate the expropriators. It wanted to turn the means of production, land, and capital, which are now mainly used as tools for enslaving and exploiting labor, into tools of free collective labor."?
    These characteristics of the Paris Commune show that it was the opposite of all regimes of the exploiting classes. It was not a tool for a few exploiters to rule the broad working people, but a tool for the exploited to control their own destiny and fight for their own liberation. Therefore, the reactionaries regarded it as a "ferocious flood." The pseudo-socialist Louis Blanc also attacked the Commune as "elected by very few voters, and the vast majority of its members are unknown people who are doubtful in their ability and even sometimes in their personality—at least for some people."? He beautified the National Assembly of Versailles and attacked the Commune as the culprit for launching the civil war. He said: "Ah! Civil war! Terrible struggle! The artillery is roaring! Kill, die, those in the National Assembly who would rather sacrifice their lives to peacefully resolve this bloody problem are forced to be unable to take any action, make any cries, or say anything!"? These shameless lies of this traitor vividly portray an ugly face of opposition to the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Marxist classic writers resolutely refuted the reactionaries' slander of the Paris Commune. They pointed out that the Commune was an incomplete and immature dictatorship of the proletariat because it lacked the leadership of a Marxist party and the guidance of Marxist theory. But it made a world-significant attempt to realize the rule of the proletariat. Marx said: "The true secret of the Commune was this: it was essentially a working-class government, the result of the struggle of the producing class against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economic emancipation of labor."? Marxist classic writers also pointed out that this form of government of the Commune, as well as some of the Commune's correct measures, was the product of proletarian revolutionary practice and the crystallization of the creativity of the masses of the people. The proletariat, taking up arms to strive for the right to its own liberation and to strive to control its own destiny, broke through the shackles of Proudhonism and Blanquism with its own class instincts and forged a path in the struggle. Engels said: "The Commune is the grave of the old, French-style socialism, but at the same time it is the cradle of the new (for France) international communism."? "Although the Proudhonists were represented in the Commune in large numbers, no attempt was ever made to settle the old society or organize economic forces according to Proudhon's plan. On the contrary, the Commune's greatest honor is that the 'living soul' of all its economic measures was not composed of any principle, but of simple practical needs. For this reason, these measures—the abolition of night work for bakers, the prohibition of factory fines, the confiscation of closed factories and workshops and their transfer to workers' groups—do not conform to the spirit of Proudhon at all, but to the spirit of German scientific socialism."? Lenin said: "No matter how absurd and erroneous the theories of Blanqui and Proudhon are, the masses have raised the entire movement to a higher stage."?
    Smashing the bourgeois military-bureaucratic machine and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat to replace the bourgeois dictatorship is the most important content of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, and it is the most important experience of the Paris Commune. It is on this fundamental issue that the watershed between Marxists-Leninists and opportunists and revisionists is formed. Marx and Engels sharply criticized the right-wing opportunists' "parliamentary cretinism" and "fear of the dictatorship of the proletariat." Lenin and Stalin sharply criticized the Second International revisionists' fallacy of "peaceful growth into socialism."
    Now, Marxists-Leninists in various countries of the world are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the Khrushchev revisionists' reactionary words and deeds such as "peaceful transition" and "state of the whole people." Under the pretext of the changes of the times, the Khrushchev revisionists promote the deceptive nonsense that the proletariat can seize power without smashing the bourgeois state machine, and that socialism can be built without the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    In the more than ninety years from the Paris Commune uprising to the present, the world has indeed undergone tremendous changes. However, no change in any aspect can change the anti-socialist nature of the bourgeoisie. The closer the capitalist system gets to death, the more the bourgeoisie tries to strengthen its state machine and make a desperate struggle. Taking the United States as an example, it only had more than 42,000 troops in 1871, but now it has more than 2.6 million troops. Compared with the armies of Bismarck, Napoleon III, and Thiers, this army is not only many times larger in number and hundreds of times better equipped, but also thousands of times more reactionary. It plays the role of international gendarme, trying to strangle the revolutionary movement in the United States and also trying to strangle the revolutionary movements in various countries of the world. Under the conditions that the bourgeois state machine is unprecedentedly large and unprecedentedly reactionary, and under the conditions that the bourgeoisie is madly undermining the cause of proletarian liberation by armed subversion, peaceful evolution, and all kinds of pseudo-socialism, to promote the so-called fact that the proletariat can seize power without smashing the bourgeois state machine, and that socialism can be built without the dictatorship of the proletariat, is to promote false revolution and real surrender, and to peddle false socialism and maintain real capitalism. The Khrushchev revisionists are precisely the brokers who peddle false revolution and false socialism.
        The proletariat that has seized power must prevent its
    state organs from changing from social servants to social
    masters; all cadres of the proletarian state organs must
    abolish high salaries, concurrent salaries, and must not
    enjoy any privileges.
    How to prevent the state organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat from degenerating and changing their nature? The Paris Commune made some explorations on this issue and took some measures that, although preliminary, were of extremely far-reaching significance, giving us important revelations.
    Engels said: "In order to prevent the state and state organs from changing from social servants to social masters—a phenomenon that is inevitable in all countries to date—the Commune took two correct measures. First, it handed over all positions in administration, justice, and national education to people elected by universal suffrage, and stipulated that electors could replace those elected at any time. Second, it paid all public officials, regardless of their position, only the same wages as other workers. The highest salary ever paid by the Commune was 6,000 francs. In this way, even if the Commune had not stipulated limited power of attorney for the representatives of the various representative bodies, it could reliably prevent people from pursuing promotion and wealth."?
    The masses of the people were the true masters of the Paris Commune. During the existence of the Commune, the masses were widely organized, and they discussed state affairs in their own organizations. Every day, about 20,000 activists attended club meetings, making proposals or criticisms on matters large and small in social and political life. They also expressed their wishes and demands by contributing to revolutionary newspapers and writing letters. This revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative of the masses of the people was the source of the Commune's strength.
    The members of the Paris Commune paid close attention to listening to the opinions of the masses. They attended various meetings of the masses and studied the letters from the masses. The Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of the Commune said in a notice to the Commune Secretary: "We receive a large number of suggestions, both oral and written, every day. Some are put forward by individuals, and some are passed by clubs or international branches. These are often very good suggestions and should be submitted to the Commune for review."? The Commune did seriously consider and adopt the suggestions of the masses. Many famous decrees of the Commune, such as the abolition of high salaries for public officials, the cancellation of unpaid rent, the implementation of non-religious education, and the prohibition of night work for bakers, were all based on the suggestions of the masses of the people.
    The masses of the people also carried out serious supervision of the members of the Commune and the work of the Commune. A Commune club in the Third District said in a resolution: "The people are the masters of their own affairs..., if the people you elected show wavering or stagnation, please push them forward in order to achieve the purpose we want to achieve—that is, to strive for our rights, consolidate the republic, and make the cause of justice victorious." The masses criticized the Commune for not taking resolute measures to deal with counter-revolutionaries, deserters, and traitors, for not implementing its own decrees in a timely manner, and for some disunity among the members of the committee. For example, a reader's letter published in the *Duchesne Old Father's Newspaper* on April 27 said: "Please always urge the members of the Commune, please don't doze off, don't delay the implementation of your own decrees. Let them always avoid private disputes, because only when they agree with each other will they have greater strength to defend the Commune."
    The removal and recall of elected persons who violated the interests of the people was also not just empty talk. The Commune dismissed Blanchet from his post as a member of the committee because he had been a monk, a merchant, and an informant. When Paris was besieged, he hid in the National Guard and joined the Commune under a false name. The Commune dismissed Cluseret from his post as a military representative because he "neglected his duties... and almost lost Fort Issy." Before that, the traitor Lullier was also dismissed and arrested by the Central Committee of the National Guard.
      The Paris Commune resolutely abolished any privileges of cadres of state organs, especially in terms of wages, and made major reforms of historical significance.
    We know that in order to cultivate a group of masters who ride high above the people, the state of the exploiting class always gives officials generous treatment and all kinds of privileges. High salaries and rampant bullying are the epitome of the officials of the exploiting class. Taking the French Second Empire as an example, the annual salary of officials at that time was: 30,000 francs for members of Congress, 50,000 francs for ministers, 100,000 francs for members of the Privy Council, and 130,000 francs for members of the State Council. If a person held several official titles, the income would be even higher. Rouher, a favored courtier of Napoleon III, held three positions as a member of Congress, a member of the Privy Council, and a member of the State Council, and his annual salary was 260,000 francs, which was equivalent to 150 years of income for a skilled worker in Paris. As for Napoleon III, the national treasury allocated 25 million francs to him every year, plus various allowances, totaling 30 million francs.
    The French proletariat deeply hated this phenomenon. Before the establishment of the Paris Commune, they had repeatedly demanded the abolition of the high salary system for officials. After the establishment of the Paris Commune, this long-cherished wish of the working people was realized. On April 1, the famous decree stipulating that the highest annual salary for public officials was 6,000 francs was promulgated. The decree pointed out that in the past, "senior positions in various public institutions often became objects of scramble due to high salaries, and were distributed according to the background forces of job seekers," and that "in a true democratic republic, there should be neither idle positions with high salaries nor excessive salary amounts."? The annual salary of 6,000 francs was equivalent to the salary of skilled workers in France at that time. According to the calculation of the famous scientist Huxley, this salary was only slightly higher than one-fifth of the salary of the secretary of the London National Education Bureau.
      The Paris Commune also prohibited public officials from taking concurrent salaries when holding concurrent positions. The resolution of May 19 said: "In view of the fact that under the Commune system, each position has a certain remuneration, the amount of which is sufficient to guarantee the life and integrity of the office holder.... The Commune has decided: prohibit all concurrent positions and concurrent salaries; public officials of the Commune should assist other aspects of work in addition to their own work, but have no right to obtain any additional remuneration."?
    While abolishing high salaries and prohibiting concurrent salaries, the Paris Commune also increased low salaries and reduced wage gaps. Taking the post office as an example, low salaries were increased from 800 francs per year to 1,200 francs, an increase of 50%; high salaries were reduced from 12,000 francs per year to 6,000 francs, a reduction of half. In order to guarantee the lives of low-paid personnel, the Commune also expressly prohibited all forms of deductions and fines.
    The members of the Commune modeled the implementation of the Commune's regulations on abolishing privileges and canceling high salaries and concurrent salaries. The head of the Commune Post Office, Commune member Theisz, was supposed to receive a monthly salary of 500 francs according to regulations, but he only received 450 francs. Commune General Wróblewski gave up his general's salary, refused to move to the Elysee Palace allocated to him, and said: "The general's residence can only be among the soldiers."
    The Executive Committee of the Paris Commune also passed a resolution to abolish the rank of general. The committee said in a resolution on April 6: "Considering that the rank of general is incompatible with the democratic organizational principles of the National Guard, it is hereby decided: to abolish the rank of general."? Unfortunately, this resolution was not carried out.
    National leaders only receive salaries equivalent to those of skilled workers, they have the obligation to do more work, they have no right to take more pay, and they have no privileges at all. This is an unprecedented creation, and its great significance lies not only in truly realizing the slogan of "cheap government"; not only in eliminating the so-called "mysteriousness" and "specialness" of state affairs used by the exploiting classes to fool the people, turning state affairs into a kind of worker's job, and turning cadres of state organs into workers who use "special tools"; but also in providing conditions to prevent cadres of state organs from degenerating and changing their nature from the aspect of material treatment. Lenin said:
  "All organs of power are not only elected, not only can they be replaced at any time, but also their remuneration is not the same as 'the masters,' not the same as the bourgeoisie, but the same as the workers—this is the ideal of the working class."? He also said: "The abolition of all office expenses and all monetary privileges paid to officials, and the reduction of the salaries of all public officials in the state to the level of 'workers' wages.' Here is precisely the most obvious manifestation of a transition: from bourgeois democracy to proletarian democracy, from the democracy of the oppressors to the democracy of the oppressed class, from the 'special force' of the state that suppresses a certain class to the suppression of the oppressors by the vast majority of the people—workers and peasants—with common force. It is precisely on this particularly obvious point, perhaps the most important point in the state problem, that people have completely forgotten Marx's teachings!... They regard this point as an outdated 'childish behavior' and 'routinely' do not talk about it."?
    Indeed, the Khrushchev revisionist leading group has completely forgotten this important experience of the Paris Commune. They pursue privileges, use their privileged status to turn public into private, embezzle the fruits of the people's labor, and occupy incomes that are dozens or even hundreds of times higher than those of ordinary workers and peasants. From political positions to lifestyles, these people are facing away from the working people and facing the bourgeoisie, looking up to the bourgeois bureaucrats. They also use high wages, high bonuses, high royalties, high subsidies, and a wide variety of ways to make money to vigorously cultivate a high-salary privileged class, trying to strengthen the social foundation of their rule. They vigorously promote "material incentives," saying that "the ruble is a powerful locomotive" and that people should be "educated with the ruble," attempting to use money to corrupt the people's revolutionary will. Comparing what the Khrushchev revisionists have done with the "childish behavior" of the Paris Commune in their minds, people can clearly see what is a servant of the people, what is a master of the people, and what is a state organ changing from a social servant to a social master. Engels once said: "Do you want to know what the dictatorship of the proletariat is like? Please take a look at the Paris Commune."? We can also say this: Do you want to know what a degenerate and changed dictatorship of the proletariat is like? Please take a look at the "state of the whole people" of the Soviet Union under the rule of the Khrushchev revisionist group.

    After its establishment, the Paris Commune issued a series of decrees aimed at destroying the old state machine and improving the living and working conditions of the working people. The picture shows some of the decrees issued by the Paris Commune. On the left is the "Letter to the Peasants," which puts forward a program that conforms to the interests and requirements of the broad working peasants. The upper center is the decree on the establishment of the National Guard, the lower center is the decree on improving the working conditions of bakery workers, and the right is the decree on the separation of church and state.

    巴黎公社的伟大启示
    ——纪念巴黎公社九十五周年
    郑之思
    《红旗》编者按：伟大的巴黎公社起义九十五周年了。本刊这一期发表了《巴黎公社的伟大启示》这篇纪念文章。
    巴黎公社最根本的原则，就是用革命暴力夺取政权，粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，实行无产阶级专政。坚持这个原则还是背叛这个原则，历来就是马克思主义者同机会主义者、修正主义者的根本分歧。
    巴黎公社的原则，是马克思和恩格斯总结了公社的经验教训揭示出来的，是无产阶级革命的根本原理。伯恩斯坦和考茨基等老修正主义者背叛了这个原则，堕落为帝国主义资产阶级的奴仆。列宁同老修正主义者进行了不调和的斗争，保卫了公社的原则，领导俄国人民取得了十月革命的伟大胜利。十月革命的道路，是巴黎公社革命道路的继续和发展。斯大林高举列宁主义的旗帜，反对了各式各样的列宁主义的敌人，维护了巴黎公社的原则，保卫了十月革命的成果。
    在斯大林逝世以后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏共的领导，经过苏共第二十次，第二十一次，第二十二次代表大会，彻底背叛了公社的原则，彻底背叛了十月革命的道路，实行一整套反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的彻头彻尾的修正主义路线，使苏联走上资本主义复辟的道路，使苏共领导成为现代修正主义的国际中心。
    这是从巴黎公社以来无产阶级专政历史的一个极其重要的反面经验。它告诉我们，任何一个无产阶级政党的领导，在没有掌握政权的时候，如果抛弃了公社的原则，就谈不到领导革命，而且就会使自己变成叛徒和工贼；在掌握政权以后，如果抛弃了公社的原则，就会使人民革命的成果有丧失的危险，而且也会使自己变成彻底叛徒和工贼，变成帝国主义的奴仆和帮凶。
    苏共修正主义领导集团及其追随者为什么要那样疯狂反华呢？其根本原因，就是因为伟大的中国革命，在毛泽东思想指导下取得的胜利，进一步继承了并且发展了巴黎公社的经验，进一步继承了并且发展了十月革命的经验。中国共产党是当代马克思列宁主义的伟大旗手，对于一切抛弃公社原则的叛徒都进行坚决斗争。因此引起这些牛鬼蛇神们的仇恨和反对，这是毫不足怪的，是值得我们自豪的。
    今天，重温巴黎公社的经验教训，对于把反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争进行到底，对于推进世界革命运动，具有重大的现实意义。
      英勇的巴黎公社起义，已经九十五周年了。
      九十五年来，世界发生了翻天覆地的大变化。巴黎公社被
  凡尔赛匪徒淹没在血海里的事业，经过四十六个年头，就在列
  宁领导下的伟大十月革命中赢得了胜利。中国革命的胜利，也是巴黎公社原则、十月革命道路的胜利。
      巴黎公社是一个划时代的伟大革命，是无产阶级拿起枪杆子力图推翻资产阶级专政、建立无产阶级专政，力图推翻资本主义制度、建立社会主义制度的第一次演习。公社英雄们给我们留下了用鲜血换来的宝贵的经验教训。
      目前，正当赫鲁晓夫修正主义者口头上推崇巴黎公社，行动上背叛公社原则的时候，发扬公社的革命传统，吸取公社的经验和教训，更具有重大的意义。
          无产阶级只有拿起枪杆子，才能争得
    自身解放的权利；不愿作奴隶的无产者的
    第一个信条就是紧握手中枪
    法国在十九世纪，是站在欧洲革命运动最前列的一个国家。它一度是资产阶级革命的中心，又一度是无产阶级革命的中心。从一七八九年到一八七一年，法国工人多次拿起武器，又多次放下武器或被解除武装。斗争、失败，再斗争、再失败，经过八十多年漫长的时间，付出了重大的血的代价。这样，无产阶级才逐渐意识到，当他们幻想在资产阶级领导下而不是在战胜资产阶级的条件下去争取自身的解放时，他们手中的枪杆子，就只是起了替自己的敌人打天下的作用。革命一胜利，不管执政的是资产阶级右派，或者是资产阶级左派，他们都用解除工人武装来“报答”无产阶级。而无产阶级一旦被解除武装，就完全丧失了自己的权利。
    无产阶级自身解放的权利，应该由无产阶级自己拿起枪杆子到战场上去争取。法国工人终于一步一步地接近了这个革命真理。一八四八年的巴黎六月起义，一八七一年的巴黎公社起义，就是他们在不同程度上将这一革命真理变为革命行动的表现。在这两次起义中，无产阶级拿起枪杆子，已经是直接同自己的敌人作战，为自己的阶级打天下。
    巴黎公社起义，是当时法国无产阶级争取自身解放斗争的高峰，也是当时国际无产阶级争取自身解放斗争的高峰。这次起义和法国工人历次起义比较起来，在运用革命武装去争取无产阶级自身解放权利的问题上，有许多伟大的创造：
    第一，起义前半年，就着手建立工人武装，凭借枪杆子，不仅建立了自己独特的政治组织（二十区中央委员会和各区警备委员会），而且建立了自己独特的军事组织（国民自卫军工人营和国民自卫军中央委员会）。
    第二，坚决顶住了资产阶级政府的威胁利诱，拒绝交出武器，国民自卫军第一次代表会议的第一项要求就是紧握手中枪。瓦尔兰说：“我们绝不能不经过战斗就缴械……只要我们一天不胜利，斗争也就一天不停止”①。
    第三，当资产阶级政府企图用暴力解除工人武装时，敢于用革命的暴力回答反革命的暴力，敢于在内有反动政府血腥镇压、外有强敌压境的条件下举行起义，变剥削阶级之间的掠夺战争为国内革命战争，摧毁资产阶级的国家机器。
    第四，起义胜利之日，没有放下武器，没有让出权力。马克思说：“这次革命的新的特点在于人民在首次起义之后没有解除自己的武装，没有把他们的权力拱手交给统治阶级的一群共和主义骗徒手里”②。
    第五，起义胜利后，依靠无产阶级的革命武装，初步建立了无产阶级的革命专政。马克思说：“这次革命的新的特点还在于他们组成了公社，从而把他们这次革命的真正领导权握在自己手中，同时找到了在革命胜利时把这一权力保持在人民自己手中的办法，即用他们自己的政府机器去代替统治阶级的国家机器、政府机器”③。
    第六，起义临近失败时，仍然英勇坚持战斗，宁肯拿着枪杆子光荣战死，不肯放下枪杆子忍辱偷生，表现了革命无产阶级的宁死不屈的大无畏精神。
    毛泽东同志说过：“劳动人民几千年来上了反动统治阶级的欺骗和恐吓的老当，很不容易觉悟到自己掌握枪杆子的重要性。”④巴黎公社的英雄们突破了反动统治阶级的欺骗和恐吓，毅然决然拿起枪杆子，去摧毁资产阶级的国家机器，这是无产阶级解放事业的一个巨大的进展，是值得大书特书的新篇章。
    剥削阶级一向认为，他们有权使用各种武器镇压被剥削者，而被剥削者手里有任何武器都是犯罪，至于拿起枪杆子造反，那更是滔天大罪。修正主义者为了适应这种反动观点，总是向无产阶级宣传“千万不要动用武器”的奴才哲学，并把一部无产阶级革命的历史，篡改成一部“和平过渡”的历史。对巴黎公社起义，也不例外。考茨基一讲起巴黎公社，就大肆渲染三月二十八日的选举，把公社说成是“全民投票”、“纯粹民主”的产物。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一讲起巴黎公社，就津津有味地“计算”三月十八日那天死了几个人，企图以此证明公社
  “是不流血地掌握了政权”。
    稍微有点马克思列宁主义常识的人都知道，每一个革命运动，都有一个发展过程，要了解这个革命，就应该从总体上看，而不能从中抽出某一天或某一种现象，以偏概全，以个别代替一般。巴黎公社的全部发展过程，从起义前夕到流血的一周，充满了革命与反革命的生死搏斗，公社英雄们在武装起义和保卫起义胜利果实时所洒下的大量鲜血，决不是修正主义者的谎言所掩盖得了的。
        无产阶级应当采用革命手段，夺取政
    权，粉碎资产阶级的军事官僚机器，建立
    无产阶级专政
    巴黎公社起义以前的法国政治舞台，很象一盏走马灯，资产阶级国家政权的各种形式，在激烈的阶级斗争中迅速交替。这样，无产阶级就亲身体验到，资产阶级国家政权各种形式的交替，无非是统治者把统治权从这一手转到另一手，从这一集团转到另一集团。转来转去，照样是资产阶级统治和剥削无产阶级。无产阶级也亲身体验到，在资产阶级国家政权各种形式交替的过程中，国家机器在每一次新变动中都变得更加庞大，更加完备，更加穷凶极恶地奴役工人和其他劳动人民。
    法国无产阶级积八十多年（一七八九——一八七一）的经验，逐步意识到“奴役他们的政治工具不能当成解放他们的政治工具来使用”⑤，无产阶级要获得解放，就必须粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，不是反对这个机器的这种或那种表现形式，而是粉碎这个机器本身。巴黎公社起义者就是这样行动的。马克思说：“这次革命不是一次反对哪一种国家政权形式——正统的、立宪的、共和的或帝制的国家政权形式的革命。它是反对国家本身、这个社会的超自然的怪胎的革命，是人民为着自己的利益重新掌握自己的社会生活。它不是为了把国家政权从统治阶级这一集团转给另一集团而进行的革命，它是为了粉碎这个阶级统治的凶恶机器本身而进行的革命。”⑥
    第二帝国崩溃后，一场政权争夺战就在资产阶级和无产阶级之间逐渐展开。一八七○年九月初，资产阶级的各个派别为了保存现成的国家机器，防止政权转入人民手中，便迅速地达成协议，组织了美其名曰“国防政府”的新政府。无产阶级由于思想上、组织上准备不足，还不可能立即成立自己的政府。但是，他们着手建立自己的政治、军事组织，这种组织日益成为巴黎工人区的实际政权，成为和“国防政府”对峙的一种力量。
    当时，二十区中央委员会和各区警备委员会，依靠工人武装和人民群众，监督国防政府和它的巴黎各区区政府的活动。工人区的警备委员会控制区长，或代行区长职权。当过市长的阿拉哥说，委员会“负责各区的武器装备、物资供应、社会福利等工作”，是“革命积极性的发源地”⑦。达留伯爵说：“它们擅自对区长施加压力以影响其决定，包办代替区长的职权，发布命令，检查住宅，经常以防止间谍为借口，进行逮捕和搜查”⑧。
    当时，在国民自卫军工人营和革命群众的监视下，“警察局已经完全无能为力，警察局长乖乖地坐在那里，生怕被人抓走”⑨。国防政府的头子特罗胥哀叹说：“市区街道已落在人民群众手里，法庭已失去作用，维持公共秩序、风尚和卫生保健的一切机关几乎都陷于停顿状态”⑩。反动当局在短短几个月内，一连撤换数任警察局长，企图恢复警察统治，但都遭到失败。
    很明显的，从第二帝国崩溃到巴黎公社起义，巴黎实际上存在着两个政府，这和俄国一九一七年二月革命后在彼得格勒出现的两个政权并存的局面相类似。
    巴黎无产阶级在资产阶级国家机器的对立面，建立与之相对抗的无产阶级的军事组织，为粉碎资产阶级的国家机器作了重要的准备。一八七一年三月十八日，当梯也尔挑起内战的时候，无产阶级正是依靠自己的武装力量，击败了梯也尔的反革命进攻，粉碎了资产阶级的国家机器。
    巴黎公社起义者根据阶级本能和政治经验，认识到常备军和官吏是资产阶级国家机器的两个主要机关，他们在起义胜利后，立即破除这两个机关。公社的第一个法令就是《撤销常备军改由国民自卫军代替的法令》。法令规定：“除国民自卫军外，不得在巴黎成立或调入任何武装部队”；“所有适合服役的公民都编入国民自卫军”?。公社解散了国民自卫军资产阶级营。
    同时，公社又在《宣布凡尔赛政府命令、指示无效的法令》中规定：“公社现在是唯一的政权，……各种社会机关的职员今后必须确认凡尔赛政府或其拥护者所发出的命令或通知为无效，无法律效力。……任何官吏或职员凡不服从本法令者，立即解除其职务。”?公社撤除了留在巴黎的反动官吏的职务，要求旧政府的一般职员老老实实地为人民办事。
    公社打破了旧的司法机关，废除了反动法统，规定法官由人民选举，公社直接任命检察长。
    公社在破除资产阶级统治人民的物质支柱——常备军之后，又立刻着手破除它统治人民的精神工具。宣布政教分离，取消宗教特权，等等。
    巴黎公社起义者在革命实践中否定了蒲鲁东主义和布朗基主义在国家问题上的错误主张。他们不是象蒲鲁东主义主张的那样，搞什么无政府状态，而是建立了无产阶级的国家机关。他们不是象布朗基主义主张的那样，搞什么少数革命家的专政，而是依靠无产阶级的革命积极性和主动性，初步实行了无产阶级专政。
    为什么说巴黎公社就是无产阶级专政呢？
    第一，公社是无产阶级反对资产阶级的革命政权。它是在无产阶级反对资产阶级的武装起义中产生的，是在粉碎资产阶级国家机器的基础上建立的。在它存在的短短的七十二天中，进行了反对国内和国际的资本主义势力的英勇斗争。《国民自卫军中央委员会说明一八七一年革命的社会实质的宣言》，把这种斗争称为“寄生生活和劳动、剥削和生产在相互搏斗”?的伟大斗争。
    第二，公社是无产阶级当家作主的革命政权。它的主要支柱是工人武装，“无产阶级专政的首要条件就是无产阶级的军队”?。它拥有工人和他们的群众组织的广泛支持。它的政策多数出自群众的倡议，反映了无产阶级和劳动人民的利益。它的领导成员由群众选举产生，接受群众监督，群众可以依法撤换和罢免。
    第三，公社是完全不同于资产阶级议会式的革命政权。在公社中“代表机关仍然存在，然而作为一种特殊的机构，作为立法和行政的分工以及议员们享有特权的议会制，在这里是不存在的。”?公社是兼管行政和立法的工作机关，公社委员会颁布法律，委员会委员执行法律，并对委员会和人民负责。
    第四，公社是坚持无产阶级国际主义的革命政权。“因为公社不是为某种地方性的或狭隘的民族任务而斗争，而是为全体劳动人类、为全体被损害和被侮辱的人的解放而斗争。”?《公社选举委员会总结》宣布：“巴黎公社的旗帜就是世界共和国的旗帜”?。
    第五，公社是一个以消灭剥削为目标的革命政权。“公社曾想消灭那种将多数人的劳动变为少数人的财富的阶级所有权。它曾想剥夺剥夺者。它曾想把现在主要用作奴役和剥削劳动的工具的生产资料、土地和资本变成自由集体劳动的工具”?。
    巴黎公社的这些特征说明，它是一切剥削阶级政权的对立物，它不是少数剥削者统治广大劳动人民的工具，而是被剥削者掌握自己命运，争取自身解放的工具。因此，反动派把它看成是“洪水猛兽”。冒牌社会主义者路易·勃朗也攻击公社“是由很少的选民选出来的，它的绝大多数成员是无名之辈，他们在能力上、甚至有时在人格上——至少对某些人说来——都是可以怀疑的”?。他美化凡尔赛的国民议会，攻击公社是发动内战的罪魁。他说：“啊！内战呀！可怕的斗争！大炮在怒吼！杀呀，死呀，那些在国民议会里宁愿牺牲生命也要和平解决这个流血问题的人，竟被迫不能作出任何行动，发出任何呐喊，也不能说任何话了！”?这个叛徒的这些无耻谎言，活生生地勾画出一副反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的丑恶嘴脸。
    马克思主义经典作家坚决驳斥了反动派对巴黎公社的污蔑。他们指出，公社由于没有马克思主义政党的领导，没有马克思主义理论的指导，因而是一个不完全、不成熟的无产阶级专政。但它在实现无产阶级的统治方面，作了具有世界意义的尝试。马克思说：“公社的真正秘密就在于：它实质上是工人阶级的政府，是生产者阶级同占有者阶级斗争的结果，是终于发现的、可以使劳动在经济上获得解放的政治形式。”?马克思主义经典作家还指出，公社这种政权形式，以及公社的一些正确的措施，是无产阶级革命实践的产物，是人民群众创造性的结晶。拿起枪杆子力争自身解放权利，力争掌握自己命运的无产阶级，凭着自己的阶级本能冲破了蒲鲁东主义和布朗基主义的束缚，在斗争中闯出一条路来。恩格斯说：“公社是旧的、法国式的社会主义的坟墓，但同时也是新的（对法国来说）国际共产主义的摇篮。”?“虽然蒲鲁东主义者在公社中有许多代表，可是根据蒲鲁东的方案来清算旧社会或组织经济力量的尝试却一点也不曾做过。恰恰相反，公社莫大的荣幸，就在于它的一切经济措施的‘活的灵魂’不是由什么原则，而是由简单的实际需要所构成。正因为如此，所以这些措施——废除面包工人的夜工、禁止工厂罚款、没收停业工厂和作坊并将其交给工人团体——一点不合乎蒲鲁东的精神，而合乎德国科学社会主义的精神。”?列宁说：“不管布朗基和蒲鲁东的荒谬理论和错误怎样，群众究竟把整个运动提到了更高的阶段。”?
    粉碎资产阶级的军事官僚机器，建立无产阶级专政以代替资产阶级专政，这是马克思列宁主义国家学说最主要的内容，这是巴黎公社最主要的经验。正是在这个根本问题上，形成了马克思列宁主义者同机会主义者、修正主义者的分水岭。马克思和恩格斯对右倾机会主义者的“议会痴呆症”和“无产阶级专政恐惧病”进行了尖锐的批判。列宁和斯大林对第二国际修正主义者的“和平长入社会主义”的谬论进行了尖锐的批判。
    现在，世界各国的马克思列宁主义者，正在同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的“和平过渡”、“全民国家”等等反动言行进行不调和的斗争。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者借口时代的变化，宣传不粉碎资产阶级国家机器无产阶级也可以夺取政权，没有无产阶级专政也可以建设社会主义的骗人鬼话。
    从巴黎公社起义到现在，这九十多年中，世界上确实发生了巨大变化。但是，无论那一方面的变化，都不可能改变资产阶级反社会主义的本性。资本主义制度越是临近死亡，资产阶级就越是千方百计地加强自己的国家机器，进行垂死挣扎。以美国为例，它在一八七一年只有军队四万二千多人，现在竟达二百六十多万人。这支军队和俾斯麦、拿破仑第三、梯也尔的军队比较起来，不仅在人数上庞大几倍或几十倍，在装备上精良几百倍，而且在反动程度上穷凶极恶几千倍。它充当着国际宪兵的角色，既想扼杀美国的革命运动，又想扼杀世界各国的革命运动。在资产阶级的国家机器空前庞大、空前反动的条件下，在资产阶级用武装颠覆，用和平演变，用形形色色的假社会主义疯狂地破坏无产阶级解放事业的条件下，宣传所谓不粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，无产阶级也可以夺取政权，没有无产阶级专政也可以建设社会主义，就是宣传假革命、真投降，就是贩卖假社会主义，维护真资本主义。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正是贩卖假革命、假社会主义的掮客。
        取得政权的无产阶级必须防止自己的
    国家机关由社会公仆变为社会主宰；无产
    阶级国家机关的干部，一律废除高薪、兼
    薪，不得享有任何特权
    怎样防止无产阶级专政的国家机关发生蜕化变质？巴黎公社在这个问题上做过一些探索，采取了一些虽然是初步的但意义极其深远的措施，给我们以重要的启示。
    恩格斯说：“为了防止国家和国家机关由社会公仆变为社会主宰——这种现象在至今所有的国家中都是不可避免的，——公社采取了两个正确的办法。第一，它把行政、司法和国民教育方面的一切职位交给由普选选出的人担任，而且规定选举者可以随时撤换被选举者。第二，它对所有公职人员，不论职位高低，都只付给跟其他工人同样的工资。公社所曾付过的最高薪金是六千法郎。这样，即使公社没有另外给各代议机构的代表规定限权委托书，也能可靠地防止人们去追求升官发财了。”?
    人民群众是巴黎公社的真正主人。公社存在的期间，群众广泛地组织起来，他们在自己的组织里讨论国家大事，每天都有两万名左右的积极分子出席俱乐部会议，对社会政治生活中大大小小的事情提出倡议或批评。他们还通过向革命报刊投稿写信等方式，提出自己的愿望和要求。人民群众这种革命的积极性和主动性，是公社力量的源泉。
    巴黎公社的委员很注意倾听群众的意见，他们出席群众的各种会议，研究群众的来信。公社执行委员会秘书长在给公社秘书的通知里说：“我们每天收到大批口头和书面的建议，其中有些是个人提出的，有些是在俱乐部或在国际支部通过的。这往往是一些很好的建议，应该提交公社审查。”?公社确实是认真考虑并采纳了群众的建议，公社许多著名的法令，诸如废除公职人员的高薪制、取消欠缴的房租、实行非宗教教育、禁止面包工人夜间劳动等等，都是以人民群众的建议为基础的。
    人民群众还对公社的委员、公社的工作进行了认真的监督。第三区公社俱乐部在一项决议中说：“人民在当家作主……，如果你们选出来的人表现动摇或停滞不前的话，请把他们推向前进，以便达到我们所要达到的目的——也就是争取我们的权利、巩固共和国、使正义事业获得胜利。”群众批评公社没有采取坚决的措施对付反革命、逃兵和叛徒，没有及时施行自己通过的法令以及委员中的某些不团结现象。例如，四月二十七日《杜歇老爹报》上发表的一封读者来信说：“请经常推动一下公社委员，请他们不要打瞌睡，不要拖延实行自己的法令。让他们永远避免私人纷争，因为只有他们意见一致，他们才有更大的力量来保卫公社。”
    撤换、罢免违反人民利益的被选举者，也并非一句空话。公社撤了布朗舍的委员职务，因为他当过僧侣、商人、密探，巴黎被围时暗藏在国民自卫军中，并用假名混进公社。公社撤了克吕泽烈的军事代表职务，因为他“玩忽职守……几乎丢失伊西炮台”。在这之前，叛徒留尔耶也被国民自卫军中央委员会撤职并逮捕。
      巴黎公社坚决废除国家机关干部的任何特权，特别是在工资方面做了具有历史意义的重大改革。
    我们知道，剥削阶级国家为了培养一批高高骑在人民头上的老爷，总是给官吏以优厚的待遇和种种特权。高官厚禄，横行霸道，这就是剥削阶级官吏的写照。就拿法国第二帝国时期来说，当时官吏的年薪是：国会议员三万法郎，部长五万法郎，枢密院委员十万法郎，国务参事十三万法郎。如果一个人挂几个官衔，收入就更多，拿破仑第三宠臣鲁埃，身兼议员、枢密院委员、国务参事三职，每年薪俸二十六万法郎，相当于巴黎一个熟练工人一百五十年的收入。至于拿破仑第三，每年由国库拨给两千五百万法郎，外加各种津贴，总共为三千万法郎。
    法国无产阶级对这种现象深恶痛绝。在巴黎公社成立以前，就多次提出废除官员高薪制的要求。巴黎公社成立后，实现了劳动人民的这个宿愿。四月一日，颁布了规定公职人员最高年薪为六千法郎的著名法令。法令指出：以前“各公共机关里的高级职位由于所得高薪而往往成为钻营的对象，并按谋职者的后台势力来分配”，而“在真正的民主共和国里，既不应该有高薪的闲职，也不应该有过高的薪额”?。年薪六千法郎，这相当于当时法国熟练工人的工资。据著名科学家赫胥黎计算，这种薪额只略高于伦敦国民教育局秘书工资的五分之一。
      巴黎公社还禁止公职人员在兼职时取兼薪。五月十九日的决议说：“鉴于在公社制度下，每种职务都有一定的报酬，其数额足以保障供职者的生活和操守。……公社决定：禁止一切兼职兼薪；公社公职人员除从事其本身工作外应当协助其他方面的工作，但无权另得任何报酬。”?
    巴黎公社在取消高薪、禁止兼薪的同时，还提高低薪，缩小工资差距。以邮局为例，低薪每年从八百法郎提高到一千二百法郎，增加百分之五十；高薪从每年一万二千法郎降为六千法郎，降低一半。为了保障低薪人员的生活，公社还明文禁止一切形式的扣款和罚款。
    公社委员们模范地执行了公社关于废除特权、取消高薪兼薪的规定。公社邮政局负责人、公社委员泰斯，按规定应领月薪五百法郎，但他只领取四百五十法郎。公社将领符卢勃列斯基放弃了将官薪俸，拒绝迁到拨给他的耶利谢伊宫，并说：“将军的住处只能在士兵当中”。
    巴黎公社执行委员会还通过了取消将军军衔的决议。该委员会在四月六日的决议里说：“考虑到将军的军衔跟国民自卫军的民主组织原则不相容，兹决定：取消将军军衔”?。可惜，这个决议没有贯彻下去。
    国家领导人只领取相当于熟练工人的工资，他们有多干工作的义务，没有多拿报酬的权利，更没有任何特权。这是破天荒的创举，其伟大意义不仅在于真正实现了“廉价政府”的口号；不仅在于扫除了剥削阶级用以愚弄人民的所谓国务活动的
  “神秘性”、“特殊性”，把国务活动变成工人职务的一种，把国家机关干部变成使用“特种工具”的工人；而且在于从物质待遇方面提供防止国家机关干部发生蜕化变质的条件。列宁说：
  “一切政权机关不仅通过选举产生，不仅随时可以撤换，而且它们的劳动报酬不是同‘老爷一样’，不是同资产阶级一样，而是同工人一样，——这就是工人阶级的理想。”?他又说：“取消支付给官吏的一切办公费和一切金钱特权，把国家所有公职人员的薪金减到‘工人工资’的水平。这里恰巧最明显地表现出一种转变：从资产阶级的民主制转变为无产阶级的民主制，从压迫者的民主制转变为被压迫阶级的民主制，从国家这个镇压一定阶级的‘特别力量’转变为由人民大多数——工人和农民用共同的力量来镇压压迫者。正是在这特别明显的一点上，也许是国家问题的最重要的一点上，人们把马克思的教训忘得干干净净！……把这一点看作已经过时的‘幼稚行为’，‘照例’不讲它”?。
    确实如此，赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团，正是把巴黎公社的这一条重要经验忘得干干净净。他们追求特权，利用特权地位，化公为私，侵吞人民的劳动果实，占有高过一般工农几十倍甚至上百倍的收入。这些人从政治立场到生活方式，都是背向劳动人民，面向资产阶级，向资产阶级官僚看齐。他们还用高工资、高奖励、高稿酬、高津贴以及花样繁多的捞钱办法，大力培植高薪特权阶层，力图加强自己统治的社会基础。他们大肆鼓吹“物质刺激”，说什么“卢布是强有力的火车头”，应该
  “用卢布来教育人们”，企图用金钱腐蚀人民的革命意志。把赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所作所为，和他们心目中的巴黎公社的“幼稚行为”比较一下，人们就可以清楚看出，什么是人民的公仆，什么是人民的老爷，什么是国家机关由社会公仆变为社会主宰。恩格斯曾说过：“你们想知道无产阶级专政是什么样子吗？请看看巴黎公社吧。”?我们也可以这样说：你们想知道蜕化变质的无产阶级专政是什么样子吗？请看看赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团统治下的苏联的“全民国家”。

    巴黎公社成立以后，发布了一系列旨在摧毁旧国家机器和改善劳动人民生活和工作条件的法令。图是巴黎公社发布的一些法令。左边是《告农民书》，其中提出了一个符合广大劳动农民利益和要求的纲领。中上是关于成立国民自卫军的法令，中下是关于改善面包房工人工作条件的法令，右边是关于教会和国家分离的法令。
