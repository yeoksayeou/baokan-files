    After She Came to the Mountain Village
    Wei Ye
    One winter morning, water dripped and froze in the mountain wilderness. A young woman walked out of the piercingly cold wind, wrapped in a thick woolen scarf, carrying a light blue backpack, excitedly facing the northwest wind, heading straight up the hillside. Who is she? Going up the mountain on such a cold morning.
      "She is Doctor Bai." Comrade Gai, who accompanied me to the river beach, pointed to a red stone house on the edge of the village and said, "She lives here, a 'Five-Good' member of the Xingtai County Xihuang Village Commune health work team, training health workers in Nanhui. Actually, she is a nurse, not yet a doctor, but as soon as she came here, the commune members affectionately called her Doctor."
    She was originally a nurse at an eye hospital, named Bai Runxiu. Half a year ago, this young girl was determined to be a Bethune-style medical worker. The more she studied Chairman Mao's writings, the more she felt that she was not serving the people enough. She requested to go to the mountainous areas. The leadership approved her request. She was so happy that she couldn't sleep all night and stayed in bed reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune."
    The leadership assigned her to Xihuang Village Commune, responsible for training health workers in the Nanhui Brigade. She thought: Nanhui, this is a red flag in Hebei Province for changing the face of agriculture, and Party Branch Secretary Wang Zhiqi is also praised by Chairman Mao in "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" as a "leader trusted by the masses." Can I do a good job doing this alone? Can it meet the demands of the commune members?
    The training class began. The young men and women participating in the study had such a strong desire for knowledge. Some were a few years older than Bai Runxiu, but they still respected her so much. Bai Runxiu felt that she had learned too little. Without instruments, without equipment, only with a few books and a mouth, how could they quickly and well learn the real skills to serve the people? With this question in mind, she studied Chairman Mao's writings every day.
    It was time to teach acupuncture. The human body's meridians, acupoints, etc. had all been explained. Understanding the theory did not mean being able to treat diseases. Practice was also needed. However, there were no patients at the moment. What to do? Even if there were, one could not easily use people for experiments. Looking at the studious trainees, thinking of Lei Feng and Wang Jie's spirit of selflessness and serving others, she firmly took out needles from her pocket, handed them to a female trainee, and then smiled and said, "Come on, don't be soft-handed, prick my Baihui acupoint. Do it slowly, everyone watch carefully. If the pricking is not right, everyone can learn from the experience and lessons together."
    "Oh, Teacher Bai, I dare not prick you. If I prick wrong, it will hurt you so much!" The female trainee was too soft-hearted to insert the needle. Some trainees excitedly said, "Let's prick ourselves! How can we experiment on the teacher?"
    The poor and lower-middle peasants' ardent class feelings made her determination even firmer. She thought, how could she prick them? Whether the pricking was right or wrong, their feelings would not make an obvious judgment.
    In this way, she persuaded everyone.
    At the beginning, one trainee repeatedly practiced but could not prick the meridian lines. Bai Runxiu thought that the more it was wrong, the more she should practice repeatedly. At this time, she was not thinking about the pain, but about Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self. Under Bai Runxiu's guidance, this female trainee was encouraged and eventually developed an accurate acupuncture technique.
    Afterwards, this female trainee nervously took Bai Runxiu's hand and asked:
    "Teacher Bai, how are you not afraid of pain?"
    Bai Runxiu said cheerfully, "What's there to be afraid of? It's worth it even if it hurts a little. We suffer a little pain precisely so that the commune members don't have to suffer pain."
    Her task was originally to do training work, but she would give commune members medical treatment whenever she had free time. She often carried a medicine bag and worked in the fields with the commune members, treating those who were sick and spreading knowledge about disease prevention. Once, in Beihui Village, a little girl came to Bai Runxiu's room to play. She unintentionally saw nits in the little girl's hair, sat down, and started fiddling with the little girl's braids, looking for lice. She asked the little girl, "Who are all the people in your family?" The little girl told her about her family's situation.
    It turned out that the little girl's father was the old poor peasant Zhai Shancai, who was wholeheartedly devoted to the collective in the brigade. He drove the brigade's flock of sheep on the mountains all year round, coming and going in the wind and rain, and rarely went home. His old wife, due to the suffering of the old society, was nearly blind in both eyes.
    After giving other people medical treatment, Bai Runxiu went to Zhai Shancai's home without resting. As soon as she entered the door, she smiled at the little girl's mother and said, "Sister-in-law, I've come to comb your child's hair. You can't see, so I'll help you."
    The little girl's mother heard the accent and knew it was Doctor Bai, and she was so happy that she didn't know what to say. She touched around to move a seat and said, "Hey, you're even taking care of this!"
      "Sister-in-law, the doctor sent by Chairman Mao can cure any disease, and he is here to serve us poor and lower-middle peasants. Don't worry."
    I was very moved after hearing about the deeds of this medical worker who had gone to the countryside. At dinner time, I heard that she had returned from a medical visit, so I went to the place where she was eating. Unfortunately, there was only half a flatbread that had been bitten a few times and half a bowl of rice porridge that had been half-eaten, steaming with heat. The cook said that this was Bai Runxiu's meal. She had just sat down and taken two bites when a female commune member came to find her. She whispered a few words in her ear, and Bai Runxiu said nothing, put down her bowl, and left with her medicine box.

### 她来到山乡以后

    她来到山乡以后
    韦野
    冬日的早晨，山野里滴水成冰，从凛冽的寒风中走来一位年轻的妇女，裹着一条粗线围巾，挎着一个浅蓝色的背包，兴冲冲地迎着西北风，直上山坡奔来。她是谁呢？在这么寒冷的清晨上山。
      “她是白医生。”陪我到河滩的一位盖同志，指了指村边的一座红石房说，“她就住在这里，邢台县西黄村公社卫生工作队的五好队员，在南会培训卫生保健员。其实，她是护士，还没当医生，但一来到这里，社员们就亲热地叫她医生。”
    她原是一个眼科医院的护士，叫白润秀。半年前，这位年轻的姑娘，决心要做白求恩式的医务工作者，她越学毛主席著作，越感到自己为人民服务得太少，她要求到山区去，领导上批准她去了，她高兴得一夜没睡好觉，躺在床上看《纪念白求恩》。
    领导上把她分到西黄村公社，负责培训南会大队的卫生保健员。她想：南会，这是河北省农业上改天换地的一面红旗，党支部书记王志琪，又是毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中誉为“群众所信任的领袖人物”，我一个人在这干，能干好吗？能满足社员们的要求吗？
    训练班开始了。参加学习的男女青年，求知欲是那么强烈。有的虽比白润秀大几岁，但也那样尊敬她。白润秀感到自己学得太少了。没有仪器、没有设备，只凭几本书，一张嘴，如何使他们又快又好地学到为人民服务的真本领呢？带着这个问题，她天天学习毛主席著作。
    讲针灸课了，人体的经络、穴道等都已讲完。懂了理论，不等于会治病，还需要实践，可是，现下没有病人，怎么办？就是有，也不能轻易拿人家作试验呀，她望着一个个刻苦好学的学员，想着雷锋、王杰的克己为人的精神，于是，她坚定地从荷包里取出针，交给一个女学员，然后笑着说：“来，你别手软，在我的百会穴扎一扎，动作慢点，大家都仔细看着，扎得不对了，大家好一起取得经验教训。”
    “哎哟，白老师，我可不敢扎你呀，扎错了，你多疼呢！”那位女学员心软得不敢下针。有的学员激动地说：“扎咱自己吧，怎能在老师身上试验！”
    贫下中农炽热的阶级感情，使她的决心更坚定了。她想，扎他们，那怎行？扎对扎不对，他们的感受还不会作出明显的判断。
    就这样，她说服了大家。
    开始时，有一位学员，三番五次地练习也扎不到经络线上。白润秀想，越扎不对，越应当反复练习，此时她想的不是疼，而是白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神。在白润秀的指导下，这位女学员得到了鼓舞，结果练就了一手准确的针灸技术。
    这位女学员，事后不安地拉着白润秀的手问：
    “白老师，你怎么不怕疼呢？”
    白润秀爽朗地说：“怕什么，就是疼点也值得呀，咱受点疼，正是为了社员群众不受疼。”
    她的任务本来是搞培训工作，但她一有空闲就给社员看病。她常常背着药包同社员下地劳动，碰见有病的就治，一面宣传防病的知识。有一次，那是在北会村的时候，一个小女孩到白润秀屋里玩，她无意间看见小姑娘的头发里有虮子，坐下来就拨弄小姑娘的发辫，找虱子。她问小姑娘：“你家里都有什么人？”小姑娘把家里情况说了。
    原来，小姑娘的爸爸就是队里一心为集体的老贫农翟善才，他整年赶着队里的羊群在山上风里来雨里去，很少回家。他的老伴，因旧社会的折磨，双目接近失明。
    白润秀给别人看罢病，没顾停歇就找到翟善才家去，一进门冲着小姑娘的妈妈笑着说：“大嫂，我来给你孩子梳头，你看不见，我帮助你。”
    小姑娘的妈妈听口音是白医生，高兴得不知说啥好，一边摸着搬坐位说：“嗨，俺这事你还管哟！”
      “大嫂，毛主席派来的医生啥病也治，就是来为咱贫下中农服务的，你放心吧。”
    听人介绍了这位下乡医务人员的事迹，我很感动。晚饭时，我听说她出诊回来了，特意赶到她吃饭的地方。不巧，饭桌上只放着咬了几口的半张饼和喝了一半的半碗米粥，冒着腾腾的热气。炊事员说，这是白润秀的饭，她刚坐下吃了两口，一位妇女社员来找她来，贴着她的耳朵小声咕哝了几句，白润秀二话没说放下饭碗，提着药箱就走了。
