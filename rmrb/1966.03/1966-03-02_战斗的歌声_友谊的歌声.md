    Songs of Combat, Songs of Friendship
    Zhao Feng
    The Song and Dance Ensemble of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has come to our country for a performance tour. The combat songs and dances from the heroic land on the front lines of the struggle against U.S. imperialism, with their fervent revolutionary passion and distinct national characteristics, vividly portray the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. This not only provides us with the highest artistic enjoyment but also gives us tremendous spiritual encouragement.
    Revolutionary music is always music that possesses the revolutionary spirit of the times and original artistic expressive power. This originality is the combination of the spirit of the times and national characteristics. "Liberate the South" (Song of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front), composed by Huang Mingqin, is a war song that is familiar and loved by the broad masses of our people. In the rhythm of this war song, we can hear the pulse of the people's war that the South Vietnamese people are victoriously carrying out. In the melody of this war song, we can see the heroic spirit displayed by the South Vietnamese people. The choir of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam performed this heroic war song with a majestic momentum, and Gao Yuebai's conducting perfectly embodied the song's thought and emotion.
    "Victory Dance," composed by Ruan Wancang, as dance music, combines musical description and expressive power very well. It both depicts a moving scene and expresses profound emotions. The steps and demeanor of Vietnamese ethnic folk dance successfully express the victory of the battle and the celebration of the people, creating a moving stage image. The music for the dance "One Hand Casts the Net, One Hand Holds the Gun," the melody appearing on the woodwind instruments, portrays the heroic image of the female militia fisherfolk. The music for the dance "Hornet Battle Dance" satirically depicts the ugliness of the enemy, vividly portraying the lovely group image of the legendary hornets.
    Baritone singer Gui Yang's performance of "Your Voice Will Live Forever" (in praise of the hero Nguyen Van Troi), the music and performance create an incomparably noble and immortal image. The female chorus "Sewing Song" (South Vietnamese song), accompanied by the sixteen-stringed zither (an instrument similar to our guzheng), has music that is simple and pure, like a sparkling piece of unpolished jade. The solo performance of the "Xiyuan Dance Music" on the monochord zither presents us with a picture of beautiful rivers and mountains. ... The reason why this music has such touching power, in thousands of ways, the most fundamental is that all these music are drawn from the heroic deeds created by the great Vietnamese people in the anti-American and national salvation struggle. The immortal achievements of countless great heroes emerging from the Vietnamese people's anti-American and national salvation struggle are an inexhaustible source of artistic creation for musicians. Our respected comrades-in-arms on the Vietnamese literary and art front hold guns in one hand and pens in the other, go deep into life, and directly participate in the anti-American and national salvation struggle, which makes these creations possess revolutionary passion, combat spirit, and full emotion. This is a good example for our literary and art workers to learn from.
    What especially moves us is that our respected Vietnamese comrades-in-arms perform works that sing the praises of the combat friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people and our country's musical works. Whether it is the female chorus "Commune Members Are All Sunflowers," the solo performance of "Sing a Folk Song to the Party" on the monochord zither, or the baritone solo "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," all fully express the combat friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people and the combat friendship between the literary and art workers of the two countries, so these songs are sung with true "voice and emotion," which are the sounds of combat and combat emotions. When the song "Vietnam-China," composed by Du Run, sounded in the hall, the sound of "Vietnam-China! Ho Chi Minh-Mao Zedong!" seemed to soar straight into the clouds, and the image of the Chinese and Vietnamese people advancing shoulder to shoulder in the struggle against U.S. imperialism stood before us!
    May our respected Vietnamese comrades-in-arms continuously achieve new successes in the anti-American and national salvation struggle! (Attached picture)

    战斗的歌声  友谊的歌声
    赵沨
    越南民主共和国歌舞艺术团到我国进行访问演出。来自反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的英雄国土的战斗的歌舞艺术，以其炽热的革命激情和鲜明的民族特色，有声有色地表现了越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。这不仅给我们以最高的艺术享受，而且给予我们以巨大的精神鼓舞。
    革命的音乐，总是具有革命的时代精神和独创的艺术表现力量的音乐，这种独创，就是时代精神和民族特色的结合。黄明勤作曲的《解放南方》（越南南方民族解放阵线之歌），是我国广大人民所熟悉所热爱的一首战歌，在这首战歌的节奏中我们可以听到越南南方人民正在胜利开展的人民战争的时代脉搏，在这首战歌的音调中我们可以看到越南南方人民所表现的豪迈的英雄气概。越南民主共和国歌舞艺术团的合唱队，以磅礴的气势演唱了这首英雄的战歌，高曰柏的指挥完美地体现了这首战歌的思想和情感。
    阮文苍作曲的《祝捷舞》，作为舞蹈音乐，把音乐的描写能力和表现能力很好地结合起来。它既描绘了一个动人的场景，又抒发了深刻的情感。越南?族民间舞蹈的步伐和风姿，成功地表达了战斗的胜利和人民的欢庆，创造了一个动人的舞台形象。舞蹈《一手撒网，一手拿枪》的音乐，在木管乐器上出现的旋律，刻划了渔民女民兵的英雄形象，舞蹈《蚂蜂战舞》的音乐，讽刺地表现了敌人的丑态，富有风趣地描绘了传奇性的蚂蜂的可爱的群象。
    男中音唱家贵阳演唱的《你的声音万世流传》（歌颂英雄阮文追），音乐和演唱塑造了一个无比崇高的不朽形象。用十六弦琴（和我国古筝相近的一种乐器）伴奏的女声小合唱《缝衣曲》（越南南方歌曲），音乐质朴、纯洁，象一块晶莹的璞玉。独弦琴独奏的《西原舞曲》，在我们面前展现了一幅锦绣河山的图画。……这些音乐之所以具有如此感人的力量，千条万条，最根本的一条是所有这些音乐无一不取材于伟大越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所创造的英雄业绩。越南人民抗美救国斗争中涌现出来无数伟大英雄的不朽业绩是音乐工作者取之不尽、用之不竭的艺术创造源泉。而我们敬爱的越南文艺战线上的战友们一手拿枪，一手握笔，深入生活，直接参加了抗美救国斗争，才使这些创作具有革命的激情，战斗的精神和丰满的情感。这是我国文艺工作者应该学习的好榜样。
    特别使我们感动的是，我们敬爱的越南战友们演唱的歌颂中越人民战斗友谊的作品和我国的音乐作品，无论是女声小合唱《社员都是向阳花》，还是独弦琴独奏《唱支山歌给党听》，还是男中音独唱《大海航行靠舵手》，都充分表达了中越人民的战斗友谊和中越两国文艺工作者的战斗情谊，所以使这些歌曲演唱得真正是“声情并茂”，是战斗的声音，是战斗感情。当大厅里响起了杜润作曲的《越南—中国》的歌声时，“越南—中国！胡志明—毛泽东！”的声音好象一直冲上了云霄，中越人民在反对美帝国主义斗争中并肩前进的形象，耸立在我们面前！
    祝愿我们敬爱的越南战友们在抗美救国的斗争中，不断地取得新的成功！（附图片）
