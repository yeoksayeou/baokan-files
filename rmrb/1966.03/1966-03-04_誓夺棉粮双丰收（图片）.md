    Vow to Seize a Double Harvest of Cotton and Grain (Woodcut)
    With the vigorous development of China's socialist cultural undertakings, amateur art creation in rural areas is also exceptionally active. These amateur artists, while engaged in production labor in their respective posts, also pick up their brushes with full revolutionary enthusiasm to depict the new achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    The three woodcuts published here are selected from the "Wood Chip Flower" amateur woodcut creation group in Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, "Vow to Seize a Double Harvest of Cotton and Grain" woodcut series. The entire series consists of ten pieces, expressing from different angles the revolutionary spirit of the people of Qidong County under the leadership of the Party, striving for progress and self-reliance to vow to seize high yields of cotton and grain, truthfully and vividly reflecting the vibrant life scene of today's countryside.
    New Cotton Shipped Out: Cotton production in Qidong County has increased, and a large amount of new cotton is shipped out to support national industrial construction and the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. Li Hanping, Lu Zhenzhou
    Drilling in the Threshing Ground: Holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, always vigilant against the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
                                          Dong Baofa
    New Reclaimed Land Reaps a Bumper Harvest: Originally this was saline-alkali land, now it has been transformed into tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. Truly: the Yellow Sea beach has become a gold and silver beach, and the songs of harvest are endless.
