    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the US aggressors, disregarding the strong condemnation of world opinion, continue to spread chemical poisons and slaughter peaceful residents in South Vietnam.
    It is reported that since August of last year, the US aggressor troops and the South Korean mercenary troops have carried out over 600 "sweeps" in Binh Dinh Province, indiscriminately bombing and slaughtering large numbers of peaceful residents. At the same time, they also spread chemical poisons in thirty-two villages of Binh Dinh Province, poisoning over 25,000 people, destroying tens of thousands of hectares of crops and over 100,000 coconut trees.
    In Di An Province, from February 1st to 7th, the US aggressors continuously dispatched large numbers of aircraft to spread chemical poisons in many villages along the So Lap River in Cai Lay County. In one village of Dong Thanh Commune alone, over a hundred people were severely poisoned, causing all livestock to die from poisoning and trees to wither. Before this, the US bandits had repeatedly spread chemical poisons in this area, poisoning thousands of people and destroying large areas of crops and trees.
    In Bac Lieu Province, after spreading chemical poisons in some villages of Gia Rai County from January 9th to 19th, the US aggressors again spread chemical poisons and many gas-filled balloons in Khanh Hung A, Khanh Hung B, Tran Hoi, and Chanh Thanh Communes for four consecutive days from January 27th to 30th, poisoning over a thousand people, including many children.

    新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方各界代表一百多人十日在解放区举行会议，成立了“控诉美帝国主义及其走狗在越南南方的战争罪行委员会”。
    这个委员会的任务是：调查美国侵略强盗及其走狗的罪行，搜集有关的材料和证据，向国内和国际舆论提出控诉。
    委员会由越南南方各界代表十人组成，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团委员、佛教代表释善豪法师担任主席。
    据新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美国侵略者不顾世界舆论的强烈谴责，继续在南越撒放化学毒药，屠杀和平居民。
    据报道，从去年八月以来，美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军接连在平定省进行六百多次的“扫荡”，狂轰滥炸，屠杀大批和平居民。同时他们还对平定省三十二个乡撒放化学毒药，使两万五千多人中毒，使成万公顷庄稼和十万多棵椰子树被毁坏。
    在堤岸省，美国侵略者从二月一日到七日，接连派遣大批飞机向芹若县帅腊河沿岸的许多乡村撒放化学毒药。仅东盛乡的一个村就有一百多人严重中毒，使全部家畜中毒死亡，树木枯萎。在这之前，美国强盗曾经多次对这一地区撒放化学毒药，使成千人中毒，毁坏大片庄稼和树木。
    在薄辽省，美国侵略者继一月九日到十九日对稼来县的一些乡撒放化学毒药之后，又于一月二十七日到三十日一连四天对庆兴A、庆兴B、陈亥、正平等乡撒放化学毒药和许多装有毒气的气球，使一千多人中毒，其中有许多小孩。
