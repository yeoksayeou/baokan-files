    Seeking genuine knowledge

    Investigation and research are the prerequisite for doing all revolutionary work well. In doing any work, we must proceed from objective reality and base our subjective desires, plans, and instructions on a foundation of seeking truth from facts. Only in this way can we take the initiative, gain freedom, and achieve the intended purpose. The facts of Comrade Wang Jinshan digging wells while staying at a fixed point, and the problems Comrade Chen Huimin talked about encountering in the struggle to change the face of Dongming, both illustrate this point.

    "Investigation is solving problems." Therefore, the investigation must be in-depth, to explore the essence of the problem, and cannot be satisfied with superficial or even formalistic investigations. Things in real life are complex and constantly changing, and their original appearance is sometimes easy to see, but sometimes very difficult to see. This requires us to be down-to-earth in our investigations, rely on the masses, seek the root and source, deeply analyze various phenomena, and find the real answer to the problem. When solving the problem of digging wells, Comrade Wang Jinshan neither flinched from investigating because past well-digging had not been successful, nor was satisfied with the information provided by the commune and team cadres before drawing conclusions. Within his power, he personally organized the masses to understand the situation of flowing sand and mud, and finally made a correct judgment, found out the details of the matter, and proved that brick wells could be dug in drought-stricken areas. The comrades in Shen County demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of "not giving up until the truth is known." They not only went to see in practice and listen to the masses, but also did it themselves, together with the masses. Following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and taking Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, they found "genuine knowledge" and powerfully guided the work. Such a working spirit and style are the most solid.

    Investigation and research is an honest and scientific working method. Whether we can truly master this method depends on whether we have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, whether we have deep proletarian feelings, whether we have full working enthusiasm and the determination to look downward, and whether we have the spirit of willingly being a pupil. Comrade Chen Huimin mentioned that he had not done as solid a job in investigation and research as Comrade Jiao Yulu in the past, and the fundamental reason was that his spirit of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly" was not as good as that of Comrade Jiao Yulu. He found the real gap.

    Revolutionary methodology is unified with the revolutionary world outlook. Scientific working methods are revolutionary weapons, and only revolutionaries armed with the communist world outlook can truly master scientific working methods.

### 探求真知

    探求真知
    调查研究是做好一切革命工作的前提。做任何工作，都必须从客观实际出发，都必须使自己的主观愿望、计划、指示，建立在实事求是的基础上。只有这样，才能取得主动，获得自由，达到预期的目的。王进山同志蹲点挖井的事实，陈惠民同志谈的在改变东明面貌斗争中遇到的问题，都说明了这一点。
    “调查就是解决问题”。因此，调查必须深入，去探求问题的本质，而不能满足于肤浅的甚至形式主义的调查。现实生活中的事物是复杂的，经常变化的，它们的本来面目有的容易看出来，有的却很不容易看出来。这就要求我们在调查中脚踏实地，依靠群众，寻根求源，深入分析各种现象，找出问题的真正答案。王进山同志在解决挖井问题的时候，既不因为过去挖井没有成功便缩手缩脚，不去调查；也不满足于社、队干部提供的情况，就作出结论。他在力所能及的情况下，亲自组织群众动手了解流沙走泥的情况，终于做出正确的判断，摸到了事物的底细，证明了受旱地区能够打砖井。深县的同志在这里表现了“不得真知不罢休”的革命精神。他们不光是在实际中去看，到群众中去听，而且自己动手，同群众一起去做。他们按着毛泽东同志的教导，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，找到“真知”，有力地指导了工作。这样的工作精神和工作作风是最过硬的。
    调查研究是一个老老实实的、科学工作方法。能不能真正掌握这个方法，关键在于是否具有全心全意为人民服务的思想，是否具有深厚的无产阶级感情，是否具有满腔的工作热情和眼睛向下的决心，是否具有甘当小学生的精神。陈惠民同志谈到，他在调查研究方面过去不如焦裕禄同志做得那样扎实，根本原因就在“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神比不上焦裕禄同志。他找到了真正的差距。
    革命的方法论同革命的世界观是统一的。科学的工作方法是革命的武器，只有用共产主义世界观武装起来的革命者，才能真正掌握科学的工作方法。
