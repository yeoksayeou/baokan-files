    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th (Electric Dispatch) Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina brazenly asserted during a reply at the Senate Budget Committee on the afternoon of the 24th that the scope of the "Japan-US Security Treaty" includes Vietnam, creating a basis for Japan's open participation in the US war of aggression against Vietnam.
    According to reports, Shiina said that although Vietnam "is outside the Far East region (mentioned in the Japan-US Security Treaty), when events there relate to the peace and security of the Far East, it should be treated as belonging to the Far East region."
    Shiina also openly admitted in his speech that "because the United States has taken action (in Vietnam), the Vietnam War is related to Japan."
    According to the *Mainichi Shimbun*, the Japanese Foreign Ministry made a more blatant explanation of this issue after Shiina's reply. It said that "the 'Far East' referred to in the Japan-US Security Treaty is not something that has been accurately measured geographically." Although the Far East "generally refers to the area north of the Philippines, Japan, and its surrounding areas," because the US military uses bases in Japan, "the scope of (military) actions is not limited to this range, depending on the nature of the threat."
    The *Tokyo Shimbun* pointed out on the 25th that former Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, at the Diet session in 1961 that forcibly passed the "Japan-US Security Treaty," explained that this treaty applies to the "Far East range." However, Shiina's statement this time has clearly further expanded the scope of application of the "Japan-US Security Treaty." This not only further exposes the aggressive nature of the "Japan-US Security Treaty" that threatens Asian peace, but also shows that the Sato government is unscrupulously creating a basis for Japan to act as an accomplice of the United States so as to openly participate in the US war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 26th (Electric Dispatch) Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina further brazenly clamored during a reply at the Senate Budget Committee on the afternoon of the 25th that the scope of application stipulated by the "Japan-US Security Treaty" also includes China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    During his reply at this committee on the afternoon of the 24th, Shiina openly asserted that the scope of application of the "Japan-US Security Treaty" includes Vietnam, creating a basis for Japan's open participation in the US war of aggression against Vietnam. At the meeting on the 25th, when a member of the Japan Socialist Party asked whether the "Japan-US Security Treaty" applies to China and North Korea, Shiina replied: "If an incident occurs in that region that disturbs the security and peace of the Far East and defense is to be carried out, on this premise, mainland China and North Korea will belong to the Far East range stipulated by the 'Japan-US Security Treaty'."
    Just as the Sato government is clamoring to permanently fix the "Japan-US Security Treaty," Shiina has explicitly interpreted the scope of application of this aggressive treaty that threatens Asian peace as applicable to Vietnam, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This further exposes that the Sato government is not only assisting US imperialism in carrying out its war of aggression against Vietnam, but also attempting to act as the vanguard of US imperialism's aggression against China and the whole of Asia.
    The *Akahata* published an article on the 26th pointing out that Shiina's speech exposed a danger, that if the US-Japan reactionaries deem it necessary, the Far East range mentioned in the "Japan-US Security Treaty" can be expanded not only to the entire Asia, but also to the entire world.

### 日外务大臣椎名为进一步参加美国侵越战争制造借口  公然叫嚣日美条约适用范围包括中越朝

    日外务大臣椎名为进一步参加美国侵越战争制造借口
    公然叫嚣日美条约适用范围包括中越朝
    新华社东京二十五日电  日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎二十四日下午在参议院预算委员会上答辩时公然扬言“日美安全条约”的适用范围包括越南，为日本公开参与美国侵略越南战争制造根据。
    据报道，椎名说，越南“虽然是在（日美安全条约中所说的）远东地区之外，但是当那里发生的事态关系到远东的和平和安全的时候，就要按属于远东地区来对待”。
    椎名在发言中还公开承认“由于美国（在越南）采取了行动，越南战争和日本有关系。”
    据《每日新闻》报道，日本外务省在椎名答辩之后，又就这一问题作了更加露骨的说明。它说“日美安全条约上所指的‘远东’，不是地理学上正确测量过的东西。”虽然远东“一般是指菲律宾以北、日本及其周围的地区”，但是因为美军使用日本的基地，因此“采取（军事）行动的范围，根据所受威胁的性质，并不限定于这一范围”。
    《东京新闻》二十五日指出，日本前首相岸信介在一九六一年强行通过“日美安全条约”的国会上，曾经说明这一条约适用于“远东范围”。但是椎名的这次发言，显然把“日美安全条约”的适用范围又进一步扩大了。这不仅进一步暴露了“日美安全条约”威胁亚洲和平的侵略本质，同时还表明佐藤政府正在不择手段地为日本充当美国帮凶制造根据，以便公开地参加美国的侵略越南战争。
    新华社东京二十六日电日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎二十五日下午在参议院预算委员会上答辩时，进一步猖狂地叫嚣“日美安全条约”所规定的适用范围，也包括中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    椎名在二十四日下午在这个委员会上答辩时，曾公然扬言“日美安全条约”的适用范围包括越南，为日本公开参与美国侵略越南战争制造根据。在二十五日的会议上，当日本社会党议员问到“日美安全条约”是否适用于中国、北朝鲜的时候，椎名回答说：“如果在那一地区发生了扰乱远东安全和和平的事态，并要实行防卫，在这个前提下，中国大陆、北朝鲜等地将属于‘日美安全条约’规定的远东范围。”
    正当佐藤政府叫嚷要把
  “日美安全条约”长期固定下来的时候，椎名又把这个威胁亚洲和平的侵略性条约的适用范围，明确地解释成为适用于越南、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。这就进一步暴露了佐藤政府，不仅正在协助美帝国主义进行侵越战争，而且妄图充当美帝国主义的侵略中国和整个亚洲的急先锋。
    《赤旗报》二十六日发表文章指出：椎名的讲话暴露了一个危险，即如果美日反动派认为有必要的话，“日美安全条约”中所说的远东范围就不仅可以扩大到整个亚洲，而且可以扩大到全世界。
