    Mao Zedong Quotations
    "A truly good intention must involve a completely sincere self-criticism of the shortcomings and errors in one's work, and a determination to correct these shortcomings and errors. This is the method of self-criticism adopted by Communists. Only this standpoint is the correct standpoint."
          《Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art》

    毛主席语录
    “真正的好心，必须对于自己工作的缺点错误有完全诚意的自我批评，决心改正这些缺点错误。共产党人的自我批评方法，就是这样采取的。只有这种立场，才是正确的立场。”
          《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
