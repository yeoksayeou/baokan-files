    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd, De Gaulle’s recent new offensive against the United States on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a major event in the current international situation. The importance of this matter lies not only in the fact that it directly involves the division, reorganization, and even survival of the North Atlantic Group, the main tool by which the United States maintains its hegemonic position in Western Europe. Its importance also lies in the fact that the United States, which has been utterly defeated by the Vietnamese people in the real-fire invasion war on the eastern front, has been kicked hard by its own allies in the political contest on the western front, making the United States even more isolated and besieged on all sides.

    Challenging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is De Gaulle's established policy, an important component of his policy of opposing US control and vying with the United States for hegemony in Western Europe. Why does De Gaulle not want the military "integration" mechanism of this organization? In his own words, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an "excuse" for the United States to establish a "protected status" in Europe. Since De Gaulle returned to power in 1958, he has taken various measures to challenge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He initially suggested establishing a tripartite US-British-French steering center within the organization to strive for equal status with the US and Britain, but this was rejected by the US and Britain. Last year, he suggested completely reorganizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Now, he further believes that the differences between the two sides are too great and that a thorough reorganization is impossible. Therefore, he has taken unilateral action, announcing his withdrawal from the military "integration" mechanism of the North Atlantic Organization and reclaiming jurisdiction over US troops and bases stationed in France. This action demonstrates a major change in De Gaulle's approach, marking a new stage in the development of Franco-American contradictions, and intensifying the turmoil and division within the imperialist camp.

    On what basis does De Gaulle dare to touch the US "tiger's" behind, and why is he so eager to choose this moment, three years before the expiration of the North Atlantic Treaty?

    This is primarily the result of the law of uneven development of imperialism. In the early post-war period, the United States possessed an absolute advantage in military and economic power among capitalist countries. The wounds suffered by Western European countries in the war had not yet healed, and they were dependent on the United States in every way and could not but be in a position of control. Today, the military and economic power of Western European countries has increased relatively, and the strength of the United States has weakened relatively. Western European countries are demanding independence from the United States with greater confidence.

    However, that's not all there is to it. The disastrous defeat of the United States in the Vietnam War has promoted the development of internal contradictions within the Western camp. On the one hand, the United States has alternately used and bankrupted both "peace" and war tactics in Vietnam, causing internal and external difficulties and crises, and increasingly exposing the fact that the US "tiger" is actually made of "paper," greatly reducing the United States' leadership position in the Western world. This provides allies with an opportunity to further break free from US constraints. On the other hand, the United States has suffered repeated defeats and is increasingly eager to expand the war, and the more the war expands, the more it needs to drag its allies into the water, attempting to induce Western European allies to follow its strategic focus on shifting east, supporting the expansion of the invasion of Vietnam, with China as the main enemy. The result has not only failed to achieve the goal of dragging allies into the water but has also made De Gaulle more eager to end military subordination to the United States, unwilling to be tied to the US chariot, be swept into a war that De Gaulle considers "irrelevant" to France and "unwinnable," and ultimately become a sacrificial lamb for the United States. In a memorandum to its allies a few days ago, De Gaulle made it clear that unwillingness to be involved in the Vietnam War was an important consideration in making the new decision.

    France's decision has caused great shock in the Western world. They are deeply disturbed by the serious consequences of this action by one of the United States' main allies. Militarily, France is located in the heart of the North Atlantic Group region from Britain to Turkey and is the location of the Group's council, military command, and logistics supply network, with an irreplaceable strategic position. After France's withdrawal, the organization will become dismembered, the region will be difficult to connect, and serious supply difficulties will be created, thereby fundamentally shaking the foundation of the US military "integration" system used to control Western Europe. Although France has stated that it will remain in the alliance, an "alliance" without a military "integration" organization will be equivalent to a mere scrap of paper.

    For the United States, the more dangerous thing is the political consequences that France's move may cause and the chain reaction in the psychology of its allies. Because De Gaulle's new challenge to the United States reflects to some extent the common desire of Western European countries to get rid of US control and strive for greater say. Apart from Britain and West Germany, which are helping the United States, most Western European countries are unwilling to follow the United States in putting pressure on France. After France took action, some countries publicly stated that they would continue to be friendly to France. Some small countries have privately expressed admiration for France's spirit of daring to fight the United States. Even British Prime Minister Wilson, while doing his best to support military "integration" and waving the flag for the United States, also expressed his willingness to hold negotiations on Britain's participation in the "Common Market," sending overtures to France. Although West Germany has repeatedly emphasized that it will never abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States is still very worried that the nationalist tendencies within this alliance will develop under the influence of De Gaulle's actions. US Undersecretary of State Ball said the day before yesterday: "The distressing aspect (of France's actions) is the obvious revival of old European nationalism."

    The process of producing the so-called fourteen-nation "joint declaration" a few days ago is a vivid example of how the US baton is becoming increasingly ineffective. After more than ten days of behind-the-scenes consultations, four allied conferences were held without France. US Ambassador Cleveland was sent to Norway and Italy for special lobbying. It can be said that it took a great deal of effort to concoct a "joint declaration" of just over a hundred words. The declaration is just an empty, general statement expressing that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is still needed, without any criticism of France, far from what the United States originally expected. After the declaration was issued, Portugal also issued a special statement expressing reservations about the declaration. The United States is helpless about this, which also shows that the United States is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with few solutions.

    France's challenge and other developments are a test of the North Atlantic Group, the team led by the United States. It proves that once something happens, this team is unreliable and disobedient. The era when the United States whistles and Western Europe lines up, the United States sets the tone and Western Europe dances, is gone forever. The United States is also in unprecedented isolation among its own allies. The current crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization proves that the truly isolated one in the world today is not anyone else but US imperialism itself, the "prisoner of the White House" Johnson.

    北大西洋集团危机证明美帝国主义霸权衰落空前孤立
    戴高乐反对美国控制使帝国主义阵营加剧分化
    约翰逊政府担心法国的挑战在西欧产生连锁反应，大呼“令人苦恼”
    据新华社二十二日讯　戴高乐最近在北大西洋公约组织问题上对美国发动的新攻势是当前国际形势中的一件大事。这件事情的重要性不仅在于直接牵涉到美国赖以维护在西欧霸主地位的主要工具——北大西洋集团的分化、改组乃至存亡问题。它的重要性还在于，在东线真枪实弹的侵越战争中被越南人民打得落花流水的美国，在西线的政治角逐中又被它自己的盟友猛踢了一脚，使美国更加处于四面楚歌、十分孤立的境地。
    对北大西洋公约组织挑战是戴高乐的既定方针，是他所奉行的反对美国控制、进而同美国争霸西欧的政策的重要组成部分。戴高乐为什么不要这个组织的军事“一体化”机构呢？用他自己的话说，北大西洋公约组织是美国在欧洲建立“保护地位”的“借口”。戴高乐自从一九五八年重新执政以来曾经采取种种措施向北大西洋公约组织挑战，他最初建议在组织中成立美英法三国指导中心，争取同美英平起平坐的地位，遭到美英拒绝。去年又建议把北大西洋公约组织彻底改组。现在更进一步认为双方分歧太大，彻底改组没有可能，因而采取单方面行动、宣布要退出北大西洋组织军事“一体化”机构和收回对驻法美军和基地的管辖权。这个行动表明了戴高乐在做法上的重大变化，标志着法美矛盾发展的一个新阶段，加剧了帝国主义阵营的动荡和分化。
    戴高乐凭什么敢摸美国“老虎”的屁股，而且为什么迫不及待地选择距离北大西洋公约期满还有三年的目前这个时机呢？
    这首先当然是帝国主义发展不平衡规律起作用的结果。战后初期，美国的军事、经济力量在资本主义国家中占绝对优势，西欧各国在战争中所受的创伤尚未复元，处处仰承美国的鼻息，不能不处于受控制地位。如今，西欧国家的军事、经济力量相对增强，美国的实力相对削弱。西欧国家向美国闹独立性，腰杆更硬了。
    但是，事情还不止于此，美国在侵越战争中的惨败促进了西方阵营内部矛盾的发展。这一方面是因为，美国在越南“和”战两手交替使用、交替破产，搞得内外交困、危机四伏，越来越暴露出美国这个“老虎”原来是“纸”做的，美国在西方世界的领导地位大大降低。这就给盟国提供了进一步摆脱美国羁绊的可乘之机。另一方面，美国屡战屡败，越败越要扩大战争，战争越扩大越需要拉盟国下水。企图诱迫西欧盟国追随其战略重点东移政策，支持扩大侵越战争，以中国为主要敌人。其结果非但没有达到拉盟国下水的目的，反而使戴高乐更急于结束对美国的军事从属关系，不愿被拴在美国的战车上，被卷入一场戴高乐认为与法国“无关的”、“无法取胜”的战争，到头来作美国的殉葬品。戴高乐在日前致各盟国的备忘录中明白表示，不愿卷入越南战争是他作出新决定的一个重要考虑。
    法国的这一决定在西方世界引起了很大的震动。它们对美国主要盟国之一的这一行动的严重后果深感不安。从军事上说，法国位于从英国到土耳其的北大西洋集团地区的心脏，是这个集团的理事会、军事指挥部和后勤供应网所在地，有其无可代替的战略地位。法国退出后，这个组织将成为断肢缺腿，地区难于联成一片，造成严重的供应困难，从而在根本上动摇了美国用以控制西欧的军事“一体化”体制的基础。尽管法国表示还将留在联盟内，然而，不要军事“一体化”组织的“联盟”将等于一纸空文。
    对于美国来说，更危险的是法国此举可能造成的政治后果和盟国心理上的连锁反应。因为戴高乐对美国的新挑战在某种程度上反映了西欧国家要求摆脱美国控制、争取更大发言权的共同愿望，西欧国家，除了英国、西德为美国帮腔以外，大多数都不愿意跟着美国对法国施加压力。在法国采取行动后，一些国家公开表示要继续同法国友好。有的小国还对法国敢于同美国斗的精神私下表示钦佩。甚至英国首相威尔逊一方面极力支持军事“一体化”，为美国摇旗呐喊，同时又表示愿意举行关于英国参加“共同市场”的谈判，向法国送秋波。虽然西德多次强调决不放弃北大西洋公约组织，美国还是很担心这个盟国内部的民族主义倾向会在戴高乐行动的影响下得到发展。美国副国务卿鲍尔前天说：这件事情（法国的行动）的“令人苦恼的方面是欧洲旧民族主义的明显复活”。
    前几天发表的所谓十四国“联合宣言”的产生过程，就是反映美国指挥棒越来越失灵的一个生动例子。美国经过十来天的幕后磋商、召开了四次背着法国的盟国会议，还派大使克利夫兰到挪威和意大利专程游说，真可谓是费了九牛二虎之力才炮制出来一个百把来字的“联合宣言”。宣言只是一个表示还继续要北大西洋公约组织的空空洞洞的一般性表态，没有对法国作任何批评，远非美国原来期望的东西。宣言发表后，葡萄牙还特地发表声明，对宣言表示保留。美国对此也无可奈何，这也说明美国色厉内荏，办法不多。
    法国的挑战以及其它的事态发展是对美国统率的北大西洋集团这支队伍的一次检验。它证明，一旦有事，这支队伍就是靠不住的，不听调遣的。美国一吹哨子、西欧就排队，美国一定调子、西欧就跳舞的时代已经一去不复返了。美国在自己的盟国中也陷于空前的孤立。目前北大西洋公约组织的危机证明，当今世界上真正孤立的不是别人，而是美帝国主义自己，是“白宫囚犯”约翰逊。（附图片）
