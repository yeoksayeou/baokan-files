    Shanghai's trade and finance departments have promoted more than 680 outstanding female employees to leadership positions in recent years.
    These female employees were originally outstanding salespersons, credit officers, and service personnel from stores, banks, vegetable markets, and service industries. They have good political ideology, high class consciousness, and strong work ability. Many are young, some only around twenty years old. Now, many of them hold positions such as political instructors in district stores, Party branch secretaries and managers of grassroots stores, and deputy secretaries of the Communist Youth League district committees.
    The vast majority of these female cadres, who have grown up from salespersons, service personnel, and young apprentices, are activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. Many are advanced workers, "Six-Good Employees," and "March 8th Red Banner Bearers." Yu Cuihua, a young salesperson at Hongcheng Nanhua Store, was assigned to the store after graduating from high school in the autumn of 1962. At first, she was not very content with being a salesperson. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, she understood the principle that standing at the counter is also engaging in revolution, and she made significant achievements in her work. She has now read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" twice, and she always carries some of Chairman Mao's individual works with her, studying them whenever she has time. In 1964, she honorably joined the Communist Party and was named a "Six-Good Employee" in Shanghai. She has now been promoted to manager of the store.

    上海财贸部门提拔大批优秀女职工担任领导干部
    上海市财贸部门近年来有六百八十多名优秀女职工被提拔担任领导工作。
    这些女职工，原来是商店、银行、菜场以及服务行业的优秀营业员、信贷员和服务员。她们政治思想好，阶级觉悟高，有较强的工作能力；很多都是青年，有的只有二十岁左右，现在她们中有许多人担任着区店政治指导员、基层商店党支部书记和经理等职务，有的是共青团区委副书记。
    这批由营业员、服务员和青年艺徒成长起来的女干部，绝大多数是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。有不少人是先进工作者、六好职工和三八红旗手。宏成南货店青年营业员于翠花，是在一九六二年秋天高中毕业后分配进店的。开始时当营业员不太安心。后来她学习了毛主席著作，懂得了站柜台就是干革命的道理，在工作上做出了显著成绩。现在她已把《毛泽东选集》通读两遍，毛主席著作的一些单行本更是随身带着，有空就学。一九六四年她光荣地参加了共产党，并被评为上海市六好职工。现在她已被提拔为商店的经理。
