    Use Mao Zedong Thought to Command the Brush, Paint the Newest and Most Beautiful Pictures
    Fine arts workers in North China exchange experiences in art creation and ideological remolding, determined to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, go to the fiery struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, and thoroughly transform their subjective world.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th -- Nearly two hundred fine arts workers from North China recently gathered in Beijing to discuss the issue of ideological remolding of fine arts workers. They deeply felt that for fine arts workers to undergo ideological remolding, they must diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, go to the fiery struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, and thoroughly transform their subjective world; only by using Mao Zedong Thought to command the brush can they paint the newest and most beautiful pictures of our era.
    Many people, based on their personal experiences in recent years, spoke about the struggle between two ideologies and two paths in the process of fine arts workers going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They talked about situations such as this: A young fine arts worker in Shanxi Province used to be single-mindedly focused on producing a sensational work. After arriving in the Taihang Mountains, he felt "greatly disappointed," thinking that the peasants were "rustic" and that he couldn't have two words to say with them. He was not interested in the glorious revolutionary history of the area, nor did he paint the boiling reality of life, but instead pursued so-called "elegant" themes, only painting two pictures, *Horses Drinking in the Zhang River* and *Resting Under a Tree*. After being criticized, he earnestly studied *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, realizing that he was observing life with bourgeois literary and artistic viewpoints and couldn't feel the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants, so naturally, he couldn't create good works reflecting real life. From then on, he paid attention to studying Mao Zedong's works, actively participated in real struggles, and as his thoughts and feelings changed, he painted many works that were loved by the peasants. Fine arts workers in the Baoding Prefecture of Hebei Province took their painting drafts to the countryside several times to solicit opinions and used a bean-voting method to have the peasants appraise them. The painting that the author originally thought was the most "advanced" and "refined" didn't receive a single vote from the peasants. On the contrary, *After the Harvest*, which the author originally thought wasn't very good, received the most votes. The peasants' evaluation greatly shocked the fine arts workers. Why did they find the things they liked uncomfortable to look at, while they didn't like the things that the masses were most interested in? They gained enlightenment from Chairman Mao's works. They realized that workers, peasants, and soldiers appreciate art not from a formal perspective, but from the perspective of real life, and they can often provide pertinent evaluations of works from a clear class viewpoint and from the content of political thought. Therefore, only by going to the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time and thoroughly transforming their own position and feelings into the proletarian position and the feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers can literary and artistic workers serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers well.
    Many people also mentioned that when fine arts workers integrate with the worker and peasant masses, they must not only pass the test of life and labor but, more importantly, pass the test of thought and feeling. They must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering. A fine arts worker in Beijing went to the "Backpack Shop" to experience life. When his legs became sore from carrying the backpack up the mountain, he doubted the necessity of experiencing the hard life and complained about why the masses lived in the high mountains. Later, he restudied articles such as *Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work* and *In Memory of Norman Bethune* with the problem in mind. Comparing himself to Wang Yanxiang, the head of the Huangshandian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fangshan County, Beijing, who was extremely enthusiastic towards the masses and extremely responsible in his work, he examined his own individualism of fearing hardship and fatigue and not caring about the pain of the masses. He resolved to persist in exercising and finally painted *The Backpack Shop*.
    After studying Chairman Mao's works, fine arts worker Wei Jiangfan, with a spirit of demanding the most difficult and strict standards of himself, focused on his own ideological transformation, choosing the dirtiest and most tiring work he could find, going to the sanitation team where Shi Chuanxiang worked to empty night soil. Comparing himself to Shi Chuanxiang's revolutionary spirit, he examined his own individualistic thinking. He said with deep feeling: "This time I went to the sanitation team, I not only emptied night soil, but more importantly, I emptied the bourgeois stinking thoughts in my brain." With full revolutionary passion, he and painter Yi Shoushi co-created the serial paintings *Shi Chuanxiang*. Some fine arts workers in Shanxi Province went to Yuanping County to participate in the Socialist Education Movement. They developed a strong desire to express the struggle life of the poor and lower-middle peasants in actual struggle. They successively painted new kang enclosure paintings for the peasants, wrote slogans and couplets, and rushed to make thousands of new window paper-cuts, which were warmly welcomed by the peasants. When they held a small New Year picture exhibition on the spot, peasants from dozens of miles away rode donkeys to visit. When they were creating the large mural *In the Vast World*, with the new people and new things of the village as the theme, the commune members watched while giving the painters ideas. The fine arts workers deeply felt that as long as they wholeheartedly served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they would receive the support of the masses. Later, they also created the New Year picture *Entrepreneurship Picture* according to the demands of the peasants.
    In recent years, in the practice of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way and striving for revolutionization, fine arts workers in North China have achieved a great harvest in their creations. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year or so, more than 3,600 professional and amateur fine arts workers have newly created more than 4,000 works. These works mostly use artistic forms that are pleasing to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, reflecting the magnificent picture of socialist revolution and socialist construction in North China, and they have surpassed the previous level of fine arts creation in North China in terms of both ideological and artistic aspects.

    用毛泽东思想指挥画笔　画出最新最美的图画
    华北地区美术工作者交流美术创作和思想革命化的经验，决心努力活学活用毛主席著作，长期地无条件地到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，彻底改造自己的主观世界。
    新华社二十四日讯　华北地区近二百名美术工作者最近在北京聚会，座谈了美术工作者思想革命化的问题。他们深切感到，美术工作者要思想革命化，一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，彻底改造自己的主观世界；只有用毛泽东思想指挥画笔，才能画出我们时代最新最美的图画。
    许多人根据近几年切身的经验谈到，美术工作者深入工农兵的过程，存在着两种思想、两条道路的斗争。他们谈到这样一些情况：山西省有一位青年美术工作者过去一心想搞出一鸣惊人的作品，到了太行山区以后，他又觉得“大失所望”，认为农民“土里土气”，与农民谈不上两句话就没词了。他对当地光荣的革命斗争史不感兴趣，沸腾的现实生活也没画，却追求所谓“高雅”的题材，只画了《漳河饮马》和《树下乘凉》两张画。当他受到人们的批评后，他认真学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，认识到自己是抱着资产阶级的文艺观点去观察生活，感觉不到贫农下中农的革命胸怀，自然创作不出反映现实生活的好作品。从此以后，他注意学习毛主席著作，积极参加现实斗争，随着思想感情的变化，画出了不少受到农民喜爱的作品。河北省保定专区美术工作者，曾几次带着自己的画稿到农村去征求意见，用豆选的方式让农民投票鉴定，原来作者以为画得最“高级”最“雅致”的一张画，农民一票也没有投。相反，原来作者觉得画得不怎样好的《丰收之后》，却得票最多。农民的评价使美术工作者大为震惊。为什么他们喜欢的东西，群众看着不舒服，而群众最感兴趣的东西，他们却不喜欢？他们从毛主席的著作中得到了启发。认识到工农兵欣赏艺术不是从形式出发，而是从生活实际出发，他们常常能以鲜明的阶级观点，从政治思想内容上给作品提出中肯的评价。因此文艺工作者只有长期到工农兵群众的斗争中去，把自己的立场和感情彻底改造成无产阶级立场和工农兵的感情，才能很好地为工农兵服务。
    许多人还谈到，美术工作者同工农群众相结合，既要过好生活、劳动关，更要过好思想感情关，要遵循毛主席的教导，经过长期甚至痛苦的磨练。北京的一位美术工作者到“背篓商店”体验生活。当他背篓上山累得两腿发酸的时候，就怀疑起艰苦体验生活的必要性，埋怨群众为什么偏偏住在高山上。后来，他带着问题重新学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，对照“背篓商店”——北京房山县黄山店供销店负责人王砚香对群众极端热忱，对工作极端负责的精神，检查了自己怕苦怕累、不关心群众痛痒的个人主义思想，决心坚持锻炼，终于画出了《背篓商店》。
    美术工作者韦江凡学习毛主席著作后，以从难从严的精神狠抓自己的思想改造，选择了自己认为最脏最累的活，到时传祥所在的清洁队掏大粪。他对照时传祥的革命精神，检查了自己的个人主义思想。他深有所感地说：“我这次去清洁队，掏的不仅是大粪，更重要的是掏了我脑子里的资产阶级臭思想”。他以满腔革命激情，同画家伊瘦石合作画成《时传祥》组画。山西省一些美术工作者去原平县参加社会主义教育运动。他们在实际斗争中产生了表现贫农下中农斗争生活的强烈愿望。先后为农民画新炕围画，写标语、对联，赶制了几千幅新窗花，受到农民的热烈欢迎。他们就地举办小型的年画展览时，几十里外的农民都骑着毛驴赶来参观。当他们创作以本村新人新事为题材的大型壁画《在广阔的天地里》时，社员们一边观看，一边给画家出主意。美术工作者深深感到，只要全心全意地为工农兵服务，就会得到群众的支持。他们后来又根据农民的要求，创作出年画《创业图》。
    近年来，在活学活用毛泽东思想，努力革命化的实践中，华北地区的美术工作者在创作上获得了大丰收。据不完全统计，一年多来，有三千六百多名专业和业余美术工作者，新创作了四千多件作品。这些作品大都运用工农兵喜闻乐见的艺术形式，反映了华北地区社会主义革命和社会主义建设的壮丽图景，在思想性和艺术性方面都超过了华北地区以往美术创作的水平。
