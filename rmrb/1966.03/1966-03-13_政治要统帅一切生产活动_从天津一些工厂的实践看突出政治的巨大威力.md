    Politics Must Command All Production Activities
    ——Seeing the Enormous Power of Emphasizing Politics from the Practices of Some Factories in Tianjin
    Editor's Note: How to emphasize politics in industrial and mining enterprises, using politics to command production and all work? This is a major issue being discussed in various regions. The article "Politics Must Command All Production Activities" published in this newspaper today presents some experiences and opinions from one perspective.
    Cadres in many factories in Tianjin, under the leadership of the Party, have gradually raised their awareness of emphasizing politics through the practice of the socialist education movement and the production revolution. They are conducting a major debate on this issue. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China intends to earnestly resolve this issue through this discussion, which is very necessary. Judging from the situation of some enterprises in Tianjin, wherever emphasizing politics is done well, the revolutionary spirit of the masses is greatly boosted, and the outlook of the enterprise is completely renewed.
    All production activities of enterprises should, without exception, emphasize politics. To this end, the leading comrades of enterprises must strive to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's works, make the greatest determination, firmly grasp the "four firsts," and firmly grasp living ideas. Politics must command production. Factory Party organizations must consciously realize the revolutionization of their leading ideology; go deep among the masses and into the production process to meticulously solve ideological and practical problems; and resolutely avoid methods of grand fanfare and loud noises.
    Emphasizing politics means emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of actual work. In recent years, various regions have accumulated some experience and gained some understanding in their actual work. It is hoped that everyone can summarize them in a timely manner, exchange them with each other, and improve together.
    How powerful is the commanding role of politics? It can be clearly seen from the changes in Tianjin's industrial production in the past two years. Over seventy percent of the city's industrial products have reached the domestic advanced level in some major quality indicators; more than three thousand seven hundred new products have been trial-produced; and the original backward production situation has been reversed. This transformation was not easily achieved. Two years ago, under the leadership of the higher Party committee, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, led all the cadres in the city to examine the ideas of arrogance, complacency, and sticking to old ways, launched a socialist education movement in enterprises, and continuously promoted the production revolution through the struggle between the two roads.
    Many leading comrades of enterprises in Tianjin have gradually understood from the struggle that the leadership of enterprises must be political leadership, and that the commanding role of politics in production must be brought into play through in-depth and meticulous work to ensure that the production of enterprises and the education of employees continuously revolutionize and advance along the socialist road. Now, a major debate on emphasizing politics is being carried out throughout the city to unify thinking and further realize Mao Zedong Thought commanding everything.

    Eliminate Bureaucratic Airs and Establish Revolutionary Relationships Between People
    How to realize political leadership? One factory leading cadre asked workers for advice on this issue. The workers said that if leading cadres want to emphasize politics in the enterprise, they should implement four things: First, they must truly take the lead in organizing employees to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and transform their thinking together; second, they must work and live with the workers; third, they must spend less time sitting in the office and more time squatting on the spot to investigate and study and summarize experiences; and fourth, they must grasp people's living ideas in the teams and groups.
    The central idea of the four opinions of the worker comrades is to revolutionize the core of the enterprise leadership, strengthen political leadership, establish revolutionary relationships between people, and thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic airs. This issue is well raised.
    The Party Secretary, Factory Director, and Trade Union Chairman of Tianjin Cement Factory have been working with workers regularly and living in workers' collective dormitories since the spring of 1964. Over the past two years, they have clearly seen the different reactions of workers in three situations.
    The first situation was before participating in labor and living in collective dormitories, when workers saw them, they only nodded and never came to them to confide in them.
    The second situation was in 1964 when the leading cadres of the factory decided to go among the workers; at first, the workers were still somewhat hesitant, wanting to see how long they could persist. The workers' attitude made them deeply feel that if they did not lower their airs and did not persist in being ordinary laborers, they would not be able to truly integrate with the workers.
    The third situation was that because they persisted in labor and living in collective dormitories, the workers regarded them as the same as themselves. Once, a worker next door became seriously ill, and the Party Secretary supported the worker to go to the hospital for treatment. The leading cadres took the lead in cleaning the dormitory, helping to establish a reading room, and tutoring the workers to study Chairman Mao's works. The workers saw that the Secretary, Factory Director, and Trade Union Chairman both participated in labor and lived in collective dormitories, and felt that the leading cadres were completely the same as themselves, and were able to take the initiative to confide in the leading cadres without any restraint.
    In socialist enterprises, only by truly improving the relationship between enterprise leaders and the masses can we better mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to run the enterprise well. The experience of the factory-level leading cadres of the Cement Factory is that when participating in labor, they must put down their airs, go to work and get off work with the workers, and listen to the command of the team leader, without any special treatment. Only in this way can they truly integrate with the workers. In this way, their senses will be sharp – they can know everything in a timely manner; their speech will be effective – they can do whatever they are called upon to do. It seems that only when the enterprise leading cadres are not officials and masters in the eyes of the workers, but are completely serving the people, and only when the enterprise leading cadres are ordinary laborers in the eyes of the workers, can they truly gain the trust and love of the workers.
    The leaders of the enterprise must believe in and rely on the workers in all activities, and then they can better educate the workers and establish political mutual trust with the workers. A branch secretary of a factory mobilized workers to carry out technical innovations and told many reasons, but the workers did not move, saying: "As long as you buy back the machine that we created in the past, we will do it." It turned out that the workers had created a machine, but because the leading cadres did not pay attention to it, it was sold to the waste company as scrap, and the workers were very dissatisfied. The branch secretary heard the workers' criticism, personally went to the waste company to buy back the machine, and made a self-criticism to the workers. The workers were happy, and felt that the leading cadres truly trusted them, and quickly launched a technical innovation upsurge. From this incident, we can see how important it is for enterprise leading cadres to gain the trust of the workers through actions.

    Do "Stupid" Work and Resolutely Avoid the Style of Grand Fanfare and Loud Noises
    Some leading comrades of enterprises always shout that they are busy. "I am so busy all day long that my heels are up, how can I have time to do ideological work among the workers!" Why are your heels up? It is necessary to make a specific analysis. If you only rely on meetings, offices, and cannot grasp people's living ideas, and do not know much about the contradictions, problems, and difficulties that occur in actual life, and the situation is unclear and the right and wrong are unclear, you will inevitably end up with piles of problems, how can you not be busy and chaotic? As long as you take your own feet, be down-to-earth, go to the masses to summarize experience, establish models, and rely on the masses to solve all kinds of problems, your heels will not be up.
    Doing people's work is a basic construction of politics, and a lot of meticulous political and ideological work must be done.
    Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant wanted to transfer thirty people to support the brother plant. The Party Committee convened a mobilization meeting, talked about the significance of this matter, and called on everyone to sign up. More than one hundred people expressed their willingness to go on the spot, which was very lively. The Party Committee thought that this would solve the problem. Who knew that when the Party Committee finally determined the list of thirty people, some people said that they were unwilling to go again. The comrades of the Party Committee of the No. 1 Power Plant learned a lesson from this: "We did not deeply understand everyone's thoughts and conduct meticulous work." They were determined to participate in labor in the team, truly understand the workers' thoughts, listen to opinions, and study Chairman Mao Zedong's works with the workers. The situation quickly changed, and the problem was smoothly solved.
    A factory comrade said, "To see whether an enterprise emphasizes politics, it is not enough to just look at the surface. It is best to go to the production group to see what everyone is thinking? Doing people's work is very difficult." This view is very reasonable.
    In January, the production of the rolling ball group of North China Sewing Machine Factory could not be increased, which affected the assembly workshop from completing its task. A leading cadre changed the past method of simply issuing orders, squatted in the group, and solved the problem with the workers. The work made great progress, and one month completed one and a half months of work. The comrade squatting at the spot was very happy and prepared to cultivate the rolling ball group into a red flag group. Who knew that in February, just when they were about to further summarize the experience of the group, problems arose in this group.
    The rolling ball group has a total of twenty-five people, with only three Youth League members. The Youth League leader is the backbone of production and has always been praised in the past. One day, he violated labor discipline and was strictly criticized by the Youth League members at the Youth League meeting. He did not think it was right and said, "You can't control me." The comrade squatting at the spot talked to him and asked him to make a self-criticism, but he could not get through several times. The Youth League leader did not make a self-criticism, the workers were not satisfied, and the problem was not solved. The comrade squatting at the spot asked the workers: "Didn't you unite very well in January?" The workers said: "Because you came, everyone wanted to fight for a breath!" The workers said this, which made him suddenly realize that he could not look at the problem from the surface.
    Through this incident, the leading cadres received a great education, and further realized that people's thoughts are complex, and to do people's work well, it is necessary to understand everyone and improve everyone's political consciousness, otherwise it is impossible to manage a group well. The comrade said seriously at the Party Committee meeting: "It seems that if you can't be a good group leader, you don't want to lead the entire factory well. I want to squat down and I have to manage this group well!" Why can't a group be led well? Because, to truly lead a group well, it is necessary to seriously do political work, understand the ideological situation of each person, and solve ideological problems in a targeted manner. Such work is of course much more difficult than the formalism of grand fanfare and loud noises and impracticality.
    On the surface, doing ideological work one person at a time is "stupid" work. However, the leadership of the enterprise must emphasize politics and earnestly do the ideological work of people, and must break through this "gap". To do political and ideological work on the front line of production, it is necessary to seek depth and detail; squat in the spot and bury yourself in hard work. In this way, it does not seem lively on the surface, but in fact this is truly solid mass work, and in this way a conscious revolutionary movement will be formed among the masses.

    The Better the Situation, the More Earnestly We Must Study Mao Zedong Thought
    When discussing the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, emphasizing politics will surely make the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses surge. At this time, enterprise leaders often encounter the problem of how to correctly treat the enthusiasm of the masses and how to correctly treat the conditions. What to do? Tianjin's experience is to work hard to strengthen political leadership, earnestly organize the study of Chairman Mao Zedong's works, and truly regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest instructions.
    Tianjin Watch Factory has a very good production situation. The comrades of the factory told us: "The workers are in high spirits. After work, they continue to hold meetings for two hours without saying anything!" This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. However, from the perspective of leadership, the better the situation, the more calm we must be, and the more we must pay attention to the combination of work and rest for the workers and protect the enthusiasm of the masses. Can we imagine that if we can study the article "Concern for the Life of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods" at this time and make the meeting shorter, wouldn't it be better!
    What is the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains? A factory comrade said that the workers are now very motivated. When discussing the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, some people said, "We learn from the Foolish Old Man, we must learn his revolutionary spirit of splitting the mountains, and we must not learn his practice of leaving what cannot be done in one generation to the next generation." Is this statement right? It should be said that the workers' spirit is good, but their understanding of the revolutionary spirit is not complete. The spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains is the spirit of thorough revolution. The ambition to move the mountains is irresistible, but the mountains must be cut down ax by ax, and the revolution must be carried out generation by generation; the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains not only shows the revolutionary spirit of the working people who dare to struggle and dare to win, but also shows the scientific attitude of correctly estimating subjective and objective conditions and being honest and realistic. When organizing employees to study the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, we must explain to the employees the necessity of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific attitude. When the enthusiasm of the masses is high, the leaders must maintain a calm mind and be a calm promoter.
    The big discussion on increasing production and practicing economy should not only talk about indicators and measures, but should be combined with studying Mao Zedong's works and talking about politics commanding production. Many factories in Tianjin have recently discussed the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and changed the past practice of leaders proposing indicators, teams and groups discussing them, and individuals making guarantees. Instead of first submitting several major indicators, they first submitted revolutionary ideas. First, explain the situation and clarify the domestic and international revolutionary situation to the employees, so that the workers can link their production posts with the great revolutionary cause and improve their political sense of responsibility. Second, explain the tasks, not only explaining this year's production tasks and production directions, but more importantly, propose to learn from Daqing and strive to become Daqing-style enterprises, so that employees can establish a clear political direction. Third, explain the gaps, find out the gaps between ourselves and advanced enterprises from the perspectives of ideology, production, and technology, especially the ideological gaps, and mobilize everyone to carry out the production revolution with the spirit of continuous revolution. Fourth, explain the leaders' determination, that is, examine the shortcomings and errors in the leaders' thinking, and show the leaders' determination to rely closely on the workers to carry out ideological revolution and production revolution, and mobilize everyone to put forward opinions. On this basis, further summarize past experiences and lessons, analyze the situation and subjective and objective conditions, correctly handle the relationship between people and things, do political work in light of living ideas, and then discuss and implement the plan. In this way, putting the discussion of the plan on the revolutionization of people will easily produce indicators that are both advanced and realistic.

    Correctly Position the Relationship Between Politics and Production, and Establish the Idea that Politics is the Lifeline
    What is the lifeline of production? This is a controversial issue in the discussion. It is right for power plants to emphasize safety and place safety in the most important position in production. But can safety be regarded as the lifeline of a power plant? Many comrades did not think about this issue in the past. The regulations clearly stipulate the responsibilities of the power plant director: "Everything is for ensuring safe production." How to ensure safe power generation? Rely on regulations plus rewards. In the competition, safety is one item, and the specific goal is "four withouts" – no personal accidents, no equipment accidents, no obstacles, and no abnormalities. This time, when Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant discussed emphasizing politics, a debate was launched on the issue of what is the lifeline of the power plant. One opinion is that if the power plant does not guarantee safe power transmission, it will not be able to serve industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, therefore, good safety means good politics. Another opinion is that the issue is not whether safety is needed, but what ideas are used to command safety and how to achieve safe power transmission.
    How should we view safe production? The comrades of the No. 1 Power Plant basically unified their understanding after discussion. Everyone believes that safe power generation is important, and the establishment of certain rules and regulations is also necessary. However, if we seek safety for safety's sake, without telling people why safety is needed, without using revolutionary ideas to guide safety, and without relying on human factors to implement safe production, we are reversing the position of people and safety. If we do not do people's political work, do not start with people's ideological work, but only use rules and regulations to plug loopholes, we will never be able to eliminate accidents. If people's political sense of responsibility is not strong, if there are signs of accidents on the equipment, they often cannot be dealt with in time; if the equipment is damaged, no one is responsible, which creates hidden dangers for accidents.
    Seeking safety for safety's sake, simply relying on rules and regulations to seek safety, not seeing the human factor, not seeing the role of revolutionary ideas, actually cannot guarantee safety. There is a boiler team in the power plant that has been operating safely for many years and has often been praised. Due to the lack of correct thinking of the team members, they blindly pursued the honor of the team, the burden became heavier and heavier, and they did not dare to say when there was an "abnormality", and finally an accident occurred. Another boiler team was not advanced at first, and the working conditions were not very good. Because the workers were enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works, they were able to creatively study and apply them, fully understood the significance of the work and the significance of safe production, were very motivated, and also, according to the teachings of "On Practice," found the twelve laws of normal boiler operation, ensuring safe production and achieving "four withouts." In the same factory, managing boilers in the same way, and implementing the same rules and regulations, the understanding and practice of safety are very different due to different ideas. The situation of these two teams gave everyone a great inspiration. A comrade said: "In the past, we only grasped safety and not politics, and Mao Zedong Thought was not in command, just like watering trees by watering the leaves and not the roots. Watering the roots, the roots are deep and the leaves are luxuriant; watering the leaves, the more you water, the yellower they become."
    Therefore, the real lifeline of the power plant is not safety, but politics. To do a good job in safety, we must rely on improving people's awareness. We cannot see things and not people, see machines and not people, only want measures and not people, only want regulations and not people, use rewards to stimulate people, or use systems to control people. Put the political command in the right place, so that everyone understands the meaning of safety, everyone attaches importance to safety, everyone checks for loopholes, everyone prevents accidents, and everyone carefully maintains equipment, then it will be a hundred times safer than "seeking safety for safety's sake."

    Emphasizing Politics is the Only Way to Put "Good" First and Thoroughly Implement the Spirit of the General Line
    All the products produced by our factory are for socialist construction and for the interests of the people, and should reflect the spirit of serving politics. To do this, we must fight against the idea of not emphasizing politics.
    After the socialist education movement, the leading cadres of North China Sewing Machine Factory truly got rid of the "I" in guiding ideology and were determined to produce sewing machines according to the requirements of the masses. They sent people to the countryside to visit poor and lower-middle peasants, and to the cities to visit users. According to everyone's requirements, they produced a sewing machine called Peony Brand Small Four Four. The characteristics of this sewing machine are: First, it can sew up to thirty-two layers of cloth, meeting the requirements of users in Northeast, Northwest and North China; second, it has a forward wheel device and does not reverse, meeting the requirements of beginners; third, it is easy to operate; fourth, the price is more than ten yuan less than ordinary sewing machines; fifth, it has an automatic lifting and lowering presser foot device, which can sew and mend. When the new product was on trial sale, the Party Secretary, Factory Director, and veteran workers went to the counters of stores in Tianjin, Beijing and other places to perform and explain on the spot, and the product was quickly snapped up. In Xinjiang, the comrades of the factory visited an old Uyghur woman. The old woman said that only the factory led by Chairman Mao can produce such a good sewing machine. See, the sewing machine has become the incarnation of politics in the hearts of the people.
    Before that, North China Sewing Machine Factory had produced a sewing machine that was rated as the bottom first in the product comparison of six major sewing machine factories in the country in 1963, mainly because the sewing machine had impurities, pitting and other defects on the surface. At that time, in order to win the top three in the comparison, the factory was determined to stop production for four months, organize a major battle, electroplating, and a large number of rework and scrapping of baked paint parts were also at stake. On the surface, they were trying to improve product quality. However, in fact, what they were pursuing was how to enter the "advanced" ranks and unilaterally strive for the honor of the factory's products. As for the users' requirements for sewing machines to be flexible, light, practical and economical, they were diluted by their "upsurge" to pursue the top three. For example, the torque, according to regulations, can get full marks if it does not exceed ten kilograms. The factory's product is eight kilograms. If it can be considered for the users, it can be further reduced, but because all the technical force is used in baking paint and electroplating, they can't take care of this matter. After a hard battle in the whole factory, the goal of the sewing machine entering the top three in the comparison was achieved, but their products were not popular with the masses. In June 1965, the department store saw that this sewing machine could not be sold, and decided not to purchase it in the second half of the year, and requested the return of the products purchased in the first half of the year. This lesson helped the leading cadres of the factory truly recognize their mistakes and take effective measures to correct them. In this way, through their efforts, the Peony Brand sewing machine that the people loved was quickly produced.
    Whether the enterprise's production is truly "good" first depends on whether it takes politics as its lifeline. The comrades of the sewing machine factory have the experience: "Putting 'good' first means that the idea of thoroughly serving the people is first. When the idea of serving the people is emphasized, the 'good' will also be first. If there is only 'good' for the sake of the factory's honor and no 'good' for serving the people, the more 'good' there is, the more bad things will happen. When politics is in command, production will get better and better!" Last year, the sewing machine factory produced a maximum of 200 sewing machines per day, and this year it has reached 220, and the efficiency is still improving; the cost is gradually reduced; the Peony Brand sewing machine is in short supply. Politics has become the lifeline of production, so there is good, there is more, there is fast, and there is saving, and we can thoroughly implement the spirit of the general line.

### 政治要统帅一切生产活动——从天津一些工厂的实践看突出政治的巨大威力

    政治要统帅一切生产活动
    ——从天津一些工厂的实践看突出政治的巨大威力
    编者按　怎样在工矿企业中突出政治，以政治统帅生产，统帅一切工作？这是各地正在讨论的一个大问题。本报今天发表的《政治要统帅一切生产活动》一文，从一个侧面提出了一些经验和意见。
    天津市的许多工厂的干部，在党的领导下，经过社会主义教育运动和生产革命的实践，逐步提高了突出政治的自觉性。他们正在进行有关这个问题的大辩论。中共天津市委准备通过这次的讨论，认真地解决这个问题，这是十分必要的。根据天津某些企业的情况看，凡是突出政治做得好的地方，群众革命精神大振，企业面貌焕然一新。
    企业的一切生产活动，都应当毫无例外地突出政治。为此，企业的领导同志，都要努力活学活用毛泽东同志著作，下最大的决心，狠抓四个第一，狠抓活思想。政治必须统帅生产。工厂党组织要自觉地实现领导思想革命化；深入群众，深入生产过程，细致地解决思想问题和实际问题；要力戒那种大轰大嗡的办法。
    突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，来射实际工作之“的”。近年来，各地在实际工作中，都积累了一些经验，有了一些体会，希望大家都能及时总结，相互交流，共同提高。
    政治的统帅作用有多么大的威力？从天津市两年来工业生产面貌的变化中，可以明显地看出来。全市已有百分之七十以上的工业产品，在一些主要质量指标上，达到国内先进水平；试制了三千七百多种新产品；扭转了原来生产落后的局面。这个转变不是轻易得来的。两年前，中共天津市委在上级党委领导下，以毛泽东思想为武器，同全市干部一起，带头检查了骄傲自满、故步自封的思想，在企业中开展了社会主义教育运动，不断地通过两条道路的斗争，促进了生产革命。
    天津市不少企业的领导同志们，从斗争中逐步懂得了：企业的领导必须是政治领导，要通过深入细致的工作，来发挥政治对生产的统帅作用，保证企业的生产和教育职工，沿着社会主义的道路，不断革命、不断前进。现在，全市正在开展突出政治的大辩论，统一思想，进一步实现毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    去掉官气，建立人与人之间的革命关系
    怎样实现政治领导？一位工厂领导干部向工人请教这个问题。工人说，领导干部要在企业里突出政治，应该实行四条：一要自己真正带头，领导职工活学活用毛主席著作，一起改造思想；二要同工人劳动、生活在一起；三要少坐办公室，多蹲点调查研究、总结经验；四要到班组中抓人的活思想。
    工人同志说的四条意见，中心是要求企业领导核心革命化，加强政治领导；建立人与人之间的革命关系，彻底打掉官气。这个问题提得好。
    天津水泥厂的党委书记、厂长、工会主席，从一九六四年春天开始，定期同工人一起劳动，晚上住在工人的集体宿舍里。两年多来，他们看清楚了三种情况下工人的不同反应。
    第一种情况，未参加劳动、住集体宿舍以前，工人看见他们，只是点点头，从不找上门谈心。
    第二种情况是一九六四年，厂的领导干部决心到工人中间去；起初工人还有些观望，看能坚持多久。工人的态度，使他们深感不放下架子，不坚持做普通劳动者，就不能真正同工人打成一片。
    第三种情况，由于他们坚持劳动，住集体宿舍，工人把他们看得同自己一样。有一次，隔壁的一个工人得了急病，党委书记架着工人去医院治病。领导干部带头打扫宿舍卫生，帮助建立阅览室，辅导工人学习毛主席著作。工人看到书记、厂长、工会主席既参加劳动，又住集体宿舍，觉得领导干部完全同自己一样，能够无拘无束地主动找领导干部谈心。
    在社会主义企业里，只有真正改善了企业领导同群众的关系，才能更好地发动群众、依靠群众办好企业。水泥厂厂级领导干部的体会是，参加劳动的时候，一定要放下架子，同工人一起上下班，听班组长指挥，不能有任何特殊。这样，才能同工人真正打成一片。这样，自己的耳目灵了——什么事情都能及时知道；说话灵了——号召做什么都能做到。看来，只有企业领导干部在工人眼中不是做官当老爷，而是彻底为人民服务的时候，只有企业领导干部在工人眼中是普通劳动者的时候，就能够真正得到工人的信任和爱护。
    企业的领导者必须在一切活动中相信工人，依靠工人，然后才能更好地教育工人，同工人建立政治上的相互信任。有一个工厂的支部书记，动员工人大搞技术革新，讲了许多道理，工人不动，说：“只要你把我们过去创造的那台机器买回来，我们就干。”原来，工人创造过一台机器，由于领导干部不重视，当废品卖给废品公司了，工人很不满意。支部书记听到工人的批评，亲自到废品公司把那台机器买回来，并向工人作了检讨。工人高兴了，觉得领导干部是真正信赖他们，很快地掀起了技术革新的热潮。从这件事情可以看到，企业领导干部从行动上取得工人信任是多么重要。
    做“笨”工作，力戒大轰大嗡的作风
    有些企业的领导同志总是喊忙。“一天到晚忙得脚丫子朝天，那有时间到工人中做思想工作！”脚丫子为什么朝天？要作具体分析。如果只是依靠开会，办公，抓不到人的活思想，对实际生活中发生的矛盾、问题、困难不甚了解，情况不明，是非不清，势必弄得问题成堆，那能不忙乱呢？只要迈开自己的双脚，脚踏实地，到群众中去总结经验，树立样板，依靠群众解决各式各样的问题，脚丫子也就不会朝天了。
    做人的工作，是政治上的基本建设，要做大量的细致的政治思想工作。
    天津发电一厂，要抽三十个人支援兄弟厂。党委召开了动员会，讲了这件事情的意义，号召大家报名，一百多人当场表示愿意去，很热闹。党委以为这样一来，问题就解决了。谁知当党委最后确定三十个人名单的时候，有的人又表示不愿意去了。发电一厂党委会同志由此得到一个教训：“我们没有深入了解每个人的思想，细致地进行工作。”他们下决心到班组参加劳动，切实了解工人的思想，听取意见，同工人一起学习毛泽东同志著作，情况很快就变了，问题顺利地解决了。
    一位工厂同志说，“看企业是不是突出政治，光看表面不行，最好到生产小组，看每个人都想些什么？做人的工作，是很艰苦的。”这个看法很有道理。
    一月份，华北缝纫机厂滚珠小组的生产上不去，影响装配车间不能完成任务。一位领导干部改变了过去单纯下命令的办法，蹲到小组，同工人一起解决问题，工作大有起色，一个月完成了一个半月的工作。蹲点的同志很高兴，准备把滚珠小组培养成红旗小组。谁知到了二月份，正要进一步总结小组经验的时候，这个小组却出了问题。
    滚珠小组共有二十五个人，只有三个团员。团组长是生产骨干，过去一向受表扬。有一天，他违犯了劳动纪律，在团的会议上受到团员的严格批评。他不以为然，说：“你们管不着。”那位蹲点的同志找他谈话，要他作检讨，几次都谈不通。团组长不检讨，工人不满意，问题没有解决。蹲点的同志问工人：“一月份你们不是团结得挺好吗？”工人说：“因为你来了，大家想争口气呗！”工人这样一讲，才使他恍然大悟，认识了不能从表面看问题。
    通过这件事，领导干部受到很大的教育，进一步认识到人的思想是复杂的，要做好人的工作，就要了解每个人，提高每个人的政治觉悟，否则不可能把一个小组搞好。那位同志在党委会上严肃地说：“看来，当不好小组长，就别想领导好整个工厂。我要蹲下去，非把这个小组搞好不行！”为什么一个小组也领导不好呢？因为，真正要把一个小组领导好，就必须认真地做政治工作，了解每个人的思想情况，有针对性地解决思想问题。这样的工作比起大轰大嗡、华而不实的形式主义的做法，当然困难得多。
    从表面上看，一个人一个人地做思想工作，是“笨”工作。可是，企业的领导要突出政治，认真做人的思想工作，就一定要突破这个“缺口”。把政治思想工作做到生产第一线，必得求深求细；蹲到点里，埋头做艰苦的工作。这样，表面上看并不热闹，实际上这才是真正扎扎实实的群众工作，这样就会在群众中形成一个自觉革命的运动。
    形势越好，越要认真学习毛泽东思想
    讨论增产节约计划，突出了政治，群众的革命热情一定是汹涌澎湃。这时候，企业领导者常常碰到如何正确对待群众热情和如何正确对待条件的问题。怎么办呢？天津的经验是，下功夫加强政治领导，认真组织学习毛泽东同志著作，真正把毛主席的话当作最高指示。
    天津手表厂生产形势很好。工厂的同志告诉我们：“工人情绪很高，下班以后，接着开两个钟头的会，连二话都不说！”这的确是可喜的现象。但是，从领导的角度看，形势越好，越要冷静，越要注意工人的劳逸结合，保护群众的积极性。可不可以这样设想，如果能够在这个时候好好学学《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文，把会开得短些，岂不是更好吗！
    什么是愚公移山精神？一个工厂同志说，现在工人的干劲可大啦，讨论增产节约计划的时候，有人说，“我们学习愚公，要学他劈山的革命精神，不学他一代干不完留给下一代的做法。”这种说法对不对呢？应该说，工人的这种气概是好的，但是对于革命精神的理解却是不完全的。愚公移山的精神，是彻底革命的精神。搬掉大山的壮志是不可夺的，但是，山要一斧一斧地砍，革命要一代一代地干下去；愚公移山精神，既表现了劳动人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，又表现了正确估计主客观条件、老老实实的科学态度。在组织职工学习愚公移山精神的时候，就要向职工讲清楚革命干劲和科学态度相结合的必要性。在群众热情高涨的时候，领导者要保持冷静的头脑，做冷静的促进派。
    增产节约大讨论，不应当只谈指标、措施，应当结合大学毛泽东同志著作，大讲政治统帅生产。天津市许多工厂，最近讨论增产节约计划，改变了过去一贯沿用的领导提指标，班组来讨论，个人提保证的做法，不是先交几大指标，而是先交革命思想。第一，交形势，向职工讲清国内外的革命形势，使工人把自己的生产岗位，同伟大的革命事业挂起钩来，提高政治责任感。第二，交任务，不但说明今年的生产任务、生产方向，更重要的是提出向大庆学习，争取做大庆式的企业，使职工树立明确的政治方向。第三，交差距，从思想上、生产上、技术上找出同先进企业之间的差距，特别是思想上的差距，动员大家用不断革命的精神进行生产革命。第四，交领导的决心，即检查领导思想上的缺点、错误，表明领导上紧紧依靠工人进行思想革命和生产革命的决心，发动大家提意见。在这个基础上，进一步总结过去的经验教训，分析形势和主客观条件，正确处理人和物的关系，针对活思想做政治工作，然后再讨论、落实计划。这样把讨论计划落脚在人的革命化上，就容易产生既先进而又合乎实际的指标。
    摆对政治与生产的关系，树立政治是生命线的思想
    什么是生产的生命线？这是在讨论中一个颇有争论的问题。发电厂强调安全，把安全放在生产的头等重要地位，本来是应当的。可是能不能把安全看成发电厂的生命线呢？这个问题，过去很多同志没有想过。关于发电厂厂长的职责，条文上规定得很清楚：“一切为了保安全生产”。怎样保证安全发电呢？靠规程加奖励。竞赛评比，安全是一条，具体目标是“四无”——无人身事故，无设备事故，无障碍，无异常。这一次，天津发电一厂讨论突出政治的时候，对于什么是发电厂的生命线这个问题，展开了争论。一种意见认为，如果电厂不保证安全送电，便无法为工农业生产和人民生活服务，因此，安全好，政治就好。另一种意见认为，问题不在于要不要安全，而在于用什么思想统帅安全，怎样才能实现安全送电。
    应该怎样看安全生产呢？第一发电厂的同志们经过讨论，基本上统一了认识。大家认为安全发电是重要的，建立一定的规章制度也是必需的。但是，如果为安全而求安全，不告诉人们为什么要安全，不用革命思想指导安全，不依靠人的因素来实行安全生产，这就颠倒了人和安全的位置。如果不做人的政治工作，不从人的思想工作入手，而只是用规章制度去堵漏子，就绝不能杜绝事故。如果人的政治责任心不强，设备上有了事故的苗子，往往不能及时处理；设备遭到损害，也常常无人负责，给事故埋下了隐患。
    为安全而安全，单纯靠规章制度求安全，看不到人的因素，看不到革命思想的作用，实际上不能保证安全。发电厂里有一个锅炉小组，多年安全运转，经常受到表扬。由于小组的人缺乏正确的思想，一味追求小组的荣誉，包袱越背越重，出了“异常”不敢说，终于发生了事故。另一个锅炉小组，原来并不先进，工作条件也不太好。由于工人热心学习毛泽东同志著作，能活学活用，充分了解了工作的意义和安全生产的意义，干劲很大，还根据《实践论》的教导，摸到了锅炉正常运行的十二条规律，保证了安全生产，实现了“四无”。同在一个工厂，同样管理锅炉，执行同一个规章制度，由于思想不同，对安全的认识和作法也就大不相同。这两个小组的情况，给予大家很大的启示。一位同志说：“过去，只抓安全不抓政治，毛泽东思想不挂帅，好象浇树时浇叶不浇根。浇根，根深叶茂；浇叶，越浇越黄。”
    因之，发电厂真正的生命线，不是安全，而是政治。搞好安全要靠提高人的觉悟。这就不能见物不见人，看机器不看人，只要措施不要人，搞规程不管人，用奖励刺激人，或者用制度卡人。把政治的帅位摆正，使人人了解安全的意义，人人重视安全，人人查漏洞，人人防止事故，人人精心保养设备，那么比
  “为安全而安全”就会安全百倍。
      突出了政治，才能好字当头，彻底
    贯彻总路线精神
    我们工厂生产的一切产品，都是为社会主义建设，为人民利益服务的，都应当体现为政治服务的精神。为了做到这一点，就要同不突出政治的思想进行斗争。
    社会主义教育运动后，华北缝纫机厂的领导干部，在指导思想方面，真正摆脱了“我”字，决心按照群众的要求生产缝纫机。他们派人到农村访问贫农下中农，到城市访问用户，根据大家的要求，生产出一种名叫牡丹牌小四四的缝纫机。这种缝纫机的特点是：一、缝纫可达三十二层布，满足了东北西北华北地区用户的要求；二、有正轮器，不打倒轮，满足了初学的人的要求；三、操作灵便；四、价格比一般缝纫机少十几元；五、有自动起落压脚装置，能缝能补。新产品试销的时候，党委书记、厂长、老工人，到天津、北京等地商店站柜台，当场表演、讲解，产品很快被抢购一空。在新疆，工厂的同志访问一位维吾尔族老大娘，老大娘说，只有毛主席领导的工厂，才能生产这样好的缝纫机。看，缝纫机在人民心目中成了政治的化身。
    在这之前，华北缝纫机厂曾经生产一种缝纫机，一九六三年在全国六个较大的缝纫机厂产品评比中，被评为倒数第一，主要是缝纫机外表有杂质、麻点等缺点。当时，这个厂为了夺取评比的前三名，决心停产四个月，组织大会战，电镀、烤漆零件大批返工、报废也在所不惜。表面看来，他们是在努力提高产品质量。可是，实际上，他们所追求的是如何进入“先进”行列，片面争取本厂产品的荣誉。至于用户提出的缝纫机要灵活轻便、实用经济的要求，却被他们追求前三名的“热潮”冲淡了。譬如转动力矩，按规定，不超过十公斤可以得满分，这个厂的产品是八公斤，要是能为使用的人着想，还可以再减轻，但是因为把全部技术力量用在烤油漆、电镀上，就顾不上这件事了。全厂经过一番苦战，实现了缝纫机进入评比前三名的目标，可是他们的产品却不受群众欢迎。一九六五年六月，百货公司看到这种缝纫机卖不出去，决定下半年不再进货，并且要求退回上半年买去的产品。这个教训，帮助工厂的领导干部真正认识了错误，并且采取有效措施改正这一错误。这样，经过他们的努力，很快生产出了人民喜爱的牡丹牌缝纫机。
    企业的生产，是不是真正好字当头，要看它是不是以政治作生命线。缝纫机厂的同志的体会是：“好字当头，就是彻底为人民服务的思想当头。为人民服务的思想突出了，好字也就当头了。只有争取本厂荣誉的‘好’，没有为人民服务的‘好’，这个‘好’字越多越坏事。政治挂帅了，生产才会越来越好！”去年，缝纫机厂每天最多生产二百台缝纫机，今年已达二百二十台，效率还在提高；成本逐步降低；牡丹牌缝纫机供不应求。政治成了生产的生命线，也就有了好，有了多，有了快，有了省，就能彻底贯彻总路线的精神。
