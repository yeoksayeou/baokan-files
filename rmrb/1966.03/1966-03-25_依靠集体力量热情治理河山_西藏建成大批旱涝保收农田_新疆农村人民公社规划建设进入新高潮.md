    According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 24th: Tibet has already built 100,000 hectares of farmland guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood.

    Currently, from the banks of the Jinsha River in the east to the banks of the Peacock River in the west, from high mountain plateaus at an altitude of around 4,000 meters to river valleys at 2,000-3,000 meters, patches of farmland guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood have appeared. Many water-deficient plateaus and valleys are no longer threatened by drought.

    These farmlands, guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood, have been tested by the great floods of 1962 and the severe drought of 1964, proving that they can generally ensure a good harvest even without rain for 50 to 70 days after sowing, achieving stable and increased production.

    In most areas of Tibet, drought and flood disasters frequently threaten local agricultural production. After the Democratic Reform, the emancipated peasants of Tibet broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and engaged in basic farmland construction with unprecedented enthusiasm. Despite the high mountains, dangerous waters, and scattered cultivated land in Tibet, the emancipated peasants, unafraid of any difficulties, relied on organized strength to vigorously manage the mountains and rivers. Every winter and spring, tens of thousands of farmers and livestock brave the wind and cold to split mountains and divert water. In recent years, they have not only renovated the old, problematic projects left from the past but have also built a large number of new drainage and irrigation, and flood control projects.

    In the struggle to vigorously develop water conservancy and build farmland guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood, the emancipated peasants have received encouragement and support from the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the government. Each year, the state not only allocates special funds as grants but also provides a large number of water conservancy materials to farmers in various places. In recent years, the relevant departments of the Autonomous Region, in conjunction with the construction of key water conservancy projects, have also trained a group of peasant water conservancy workers and electricians for various places. They have become the technical backbone of water conservancy construction and the construction of farmland guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood in various places.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 24th: The planning and construction activities of rural people's communes in Xinjiang have entered a new high tide since the beginning of last winter. During this period, more than 500,000 commune members participated in the construction, building more than 1.8 million mu of strip fields, opening canals and building roads for several thousand kilometers, planting approximately 10 million trees, and building a batch of new residential areas.

    The purpose of the planning and construction carried out by the people's communes in various parts of Xinjiang is to establish stable and high-yield fields, transform the small-scale peasant economy, and develop modernized large-scale agriculture, based on Xinjiang's conditions. The content of the commune planning includes: leveling and merging small plots of farmland into large rectangular strip fields to improve land utilization and adapt to the needs of mechanized farming; extensively building and renovating irrigation canal systems and using dry-laid rubble and other methods to prevent canal seepage, so that this arid place can use as much snowmelt and rainwater as possible for irrigation; transforming curved and narrow roads and building rural avenues to facilitate the passage of tractors and large-scale tractor-drawn implements; establishing forest belts to prevent wind and sand damage; building new and renovating existing residential areas, starting from the convenience of production and the convenience of commune members' lives. After the people's communes in various places have formulated comprehensive plans, they carry out construction in stages and gradually realize the requirements of the plan.

    Since the beginning of last winter, the scale and speed of planning and construction in the people's communes have been unprecedented.

    At present, more than a dozen people's communes and a number of brigades and production teams across Xinjiang have basically met the planning requirements. In the fields of these communes and teams, strip fields are in patches, forest canals are networked, and roads are accessible. The new residential areas have neat houses, fruit trees in front of and behind the houses, and some even have electric lights. Here, agricultural production is steadily increasing, and the lives of commune members are constantly improving.

    The planning and construction of the people's communes in various parts of Xinjiang, in addition to the necessary financial, material, and technical support provided by the state, is mainly carried out by relying on the collective strength of the people's communes. The communes reasonably arrange labor, and in the slack farming season, organize a large number of laborers to carry out crash projects such as repairing canals, opening roads, planting trees, and leveling land; for some technically demanding projects, they organize year-round construction professional teams to complete them. Lacking technical personnel, they train them from practice, and there are currently more than 30,000 peasant technicians trained in various places. If funds are insufficient and materials are lacking, they rely on collective accumulation and the hands of commune members to overcome difficulties.

### 依靠集体力量热情治理河山  西藏建成大批旱涝保收农田  新疆农村人民公社规划建设进入新高潮

    依靠集体力量热情治理河山
    西藏建成大批旱涝保收农田
    新疆农村人民公社规划建设进入新高潮
    据新华社拉萨二十四日电　西藏全区已经建成十万公顷旱涝保收的农田。
    目前，东起金沙江畔，西到孔雀河两岸，从拔海四千米左右的高山台地到两三千米的河谷，都出现了一片片旱涝保收的农田。许多缺水的台地和谷地也已经不再受干旱威胁。
    这些旱涝保收农田经过一九六二年大洪涝和一九六四年大旱的考验，证明它一般在播种后五十至七十天内无雨的情况下仍能确保丰收，达到稳定增产。
    西藏大部分地区干旱和洪涝灾害经常威胁着当地的农业生产。民主改革后，西藏翻身农民大破迷信，解放思想，以空前未有的热情进行农田基本建设。尽管西藏山高水险，耕地分散，翻身农民不怕任何艰险，依靠组织起来的力量，大力治理山河。每年冬春，农民们以数以万计的人力和畜力，顶风冒寒，劈山引水。几年来，他们不仅整治了昔日遗留下来的病害工程，而且兴修了大批新的排灌、防洪工程。
    翻身农民在大兴水利、建设旱涝保收农田的斗争中，得到了自治区党委和政府的鼓励和支持。国家每年不但拨出专款作为无偿投资，还调拨大批水利器材供应各地农民。近年来，自治区有关部门结合重点水利工程的兴建，还为各地培养了一批农民水利员和电机手。他们成了各地兴修水利、建设旱涝保收农田的技术骨干。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐二十四日电新疆农村人民公社的规划建设活动，从去年入冬以来已进入一个新的高潮。在这期间参加建设的社员有五十多万人，建成条田一百八十多万亩，开渠修路几千公里，栽树约一千万株，并且新建了一批居民点。
    新疆各地人民公社开展规划建设的目的，是根据新疆的条件，建立稳产高产田，改造小农经济，发展现代化大农业的一个重要步骤。公社规划的内容包括：把小块农田平整合并成大块的方梯条田，以提高土地利用率和适应机械化农具耕作的需要；大量兴修和整顿灌溉渠系，并采用干砌卵石等办法防止渠道渗漏，使这个雨水稀少的地方，把高山融化的雪水和雨水尽可能多地用于灌溉；改造弯曲狭窄的道路，修筑农村大道，以利于拖拉机及大型机引农具的通行；建立林带，以防风沙危害；从方便生产、方便社员生活出发，新建和改建居民点。各地人民公社制订出全面规划以后，就分期建设，逐步实现规划的要求。
    去年入冬开始，各地人民公社规划建设规模之大、进度之快，都是空前的。
    目前，全疆各地已有十几个人民公社和一批大队、生产队，基本实现了规划要求。在这些社队的田野上，已经是条田成片，林渠成网，道路通达。新居民点房舍整齐，家前屋后有果树，有的还安了电灯。这里，农业稳步增产，社员生活不断改善。
    新疆各地人民公社的规划建设，除国家给予必要的财力物力和技术支援以外，主要是依靠人民公社集体力量进行的。公社合理安排劳动力，在农事空隙季节，组织大批劳动力突击修渠开路、植树平田；对于一些技术性强的工程，就组织常年施工专业队去完成。技术人员缺乏，他们就从实践中培训，各地目前培训出的农民技术员，已有三万多人。资金不足，材料缺乏，他们就依靠集体积累，依靠社员的双手，克服困难。
