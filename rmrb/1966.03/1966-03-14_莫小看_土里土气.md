    Don't Underestimate "Rustic" Things
    Beijing Radio Factory Worker Sun Youchun
    During the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, some individuals have been heard saying: "Now that we have 'rockets' and 'missiles,' what do we need 'rifles' and 'hand grenades' for?" The implication is that with large machine tools and modern equipment, why bother with small, "rustic" reforms?
    I'm not too familiar with military matters. However, we know that in modern warfare, although rockets and missiles are very important weapons, in the end, resolving battles still relies on rifles and hand grenades. Especially in close combat, rifles and hand grenades are even more crucial.
    The relationship between large machine tools, modern equipment, and small production innovations in factories isn't exactly the same as the relationship between rockets, missiles, and rifles, hand grenades. However, there are some similarities. Large machine tools and modern equipment undertake important tasks in production. However, often there are some production and technical problems that these large machine tools and modern equipment simply cannot handle effectively; these problems can only be solved by implementing small reforms. Without the coordination of these small reforms, a certain production task or technical problem cannot be completed smoothly or resolved satisfactorily.
    Furthermore, there is a close connection between large machine tools, modern equipment, and small reforms. Many large machine tools and modern equipment have evolved from small, "rustic" reforms. The situation is often like this: Without small, "rustic" reforms, there cannot be precise and perfect large machine tools and modern equipment; without engaging in small, "rustic" reforms, large machine tools and modern equipment cannot be further improved.
    Therefore, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the idea and practice of only valuing "rockets" and "missiles" while neglecting "rifles" and "hand grenades" is incorrect and must be overcome.

    莫小看“土里土气”
    北京有线电厂工人  孙有纯
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，听到个别人有这样一种说法：“有了‘火箭’、‘导弹’，还要那些‘步枪’和‘手榴弹’干什么用。”意思是说，有了大机床，现代化设备，还搞那些土里土气的小改小革干什么。
    对于军事我不太熟悉。不过，我们知道，在现代战争中，火箭、导弹虽然是很重要的武器，但最后解决战斗的还是要靠步枪和手榴弹。尤其是近战，步枪和手榴弹更为重要。
    工厂里的大机床，现代化设备和生产上小革新的关系，当然跟火箭、导弹和步枪、手榴弹的关系并不完全一样。但是，也有些类似的地方。大机床，现代化设备在生产上担负着重要的任务。可是，往往有些生产当中和技术上的问题，这些大机床，现代化设备偏偏就使不上劲儿，非得搞些小改小革才能解决问题。没有这些小改小革的配合，这项生产任务或那项技术问题就不能顺利地完成或圆满地解决。
    再说，大机床，现代化设备与小改小革两者之间又是有密切联系的。不少大机床，现代化设备都是从土里土气的小改小革发展起来的。事情常常是这样的：没有土里土气的小改小革，就不能有精密完善的大机床，现代化设备；不搞土里土气的小改小革，大机床，现代化设备也就无法进一步改进。
    因此，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，只重视“火箭”、“导弹”，不重视“步枪”、“手榴弹”的想法和做法，是不对的，必须克服的。
