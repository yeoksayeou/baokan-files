    (Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th dispatch) The Tibetan people joyfully celebrated their seventh Tibetan New Year since the democratic reform.

    The 21st was the first day of the Tibetan New Year. On that day, early in the morning, the Tibetan People's Broadcasting Station broadcast "Zhega" (a type of Tibetan folk singing), congratulating all Tibetan people in the region on the New Year. Tens of thousands of emancipated serfs raised their glasses of highland barley wine to wish another bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry this year, and to wish Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country, good health. Many families hung white hadas on Chairman Mao's portraits.

    Performing revolutionary operas and singing revolutionary songs were the hallmarks of the Tibetan people's cultural and recreational activities during the New Year holidays. Many places also held sports activities such as mountain climbing and tug-of-war during the festival.

    Around the Tibetan New Year, the turnover of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned stores throughout the region increased significantly compared to usual. In particular, foods such as white flour, rice, cooking oil, sweets, mutton, and pastries were extremely popular.

    On the eve of the New Year, cadres from people's governments at all levels across the region went to the homes of the masses to inquire about their well-being, delivered firewood, carried water, swept the floors, and provided relief funds and food to the elderly and widowed. During the New Year, many cadres also visited the homes of the masses to congratulate them on the festival.
