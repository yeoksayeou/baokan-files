    Pyongyang, March 7 (Xinhua) – The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 7th, strongly condemning the South Korean puppet regime's crime of deciding to send another division and regiment of combat troops to South Vietnam under the instruction of US imperialism.

    The statement pointed out that this new decision by the US imperialists and the Park Chung-hee group is a heinous challenge to the Vietnamese people and all Asian and African peoples fighting for freedom, liberation, and independence, and an act of provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sternly warns the US imperialists and the Park Chung-hee group that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is closely watching this provocative behavior and will never stand idly by. If the US imperialists and the Park Chung-hee group insist on increasing troops to South Vietnam, they will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    The statement said that the Korean government and all the Korean people will, as always, continue to provide the fraternal Vietnamese people who are fighting against the US imperialist aggressors with all forms of necessary assistance.

    The statement called on the South Korean people to launch a vigorous struggle demanding the immediate withdrawal of those South Korean youths who have already been sent to South Vietnam.

    The statement emphasized that South Korean soldiers must refuse to be forced to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for US imperialism, and must turn their guns against the enemy and punish the enemy in the name of the people. The statement said that this is the only patriotic action they can take to avoid death and find a way out. The statement demanded that US imperialism must immediately cease all war actions against the Vietnamese people, and must immediately withdraw its aggressive troops and all its puppet troops from South Vietnam.

    Pyongyang, March 6 (Xinhua) – According to reports in the local press, US imperialism has recently been continuously transporting various weapons to South Korea, strengthening the equipment of the South Korean puppet army, in order to draw more people from these puppet troops to serve as cannon fodder in South Vietnam.

    According to reports, on February 25, the United States transported one hundred and twenty warships to South Korea and handed them over to the troops of the Park Chung-hee group. Last November, the United States had already transported another thirty warships to South Korea.

    It is also reported that the US government recently assured the Park Chung-hee group that it would complete the equipment renewal of three South Korean reserve divisions in this fiscal year in order to reorganize them into active combat troops.

    朝鲜政府发表声明谴责朴正熙集团增派帮凶军去南越
    决不能对美朴集团的挑衅行为袖手旁观
    新华社平壤七日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府七日发表声明，强烈谴责南朝鲜傀儡政权在美帝国主义的指使下决定再派一个师和一个团的战斗部队到南越去的罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者和朴正熙集团的这一新决定，是对越南人民和为争取自由、解放和独立而斗争的所有亚洲和非洲人民的凶恶挑战，是对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的挑衅行为。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府严厉警告美帝国主义者和朴正熙集团：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府密切地注视着这种挑衅行为，决不会袖手旁观。如果美帝国主义者和朴正熙集团硬要增兵南越，他们将对由此而引起的一切后果负全部责任。
    声明说，朝鲜政府和全体朝鲜人民将象以往那样，继续给予正在同美帝国主义侵略者进行斗争的兄弟的越南人民以各种形式的必要的援助。
    声明号召南朝鲜人民开展轰轰烈烈的斗争，要求立即撤回那些已经被送到南越去了的南朝鲜青年。
    声明强调指出，南朝鲜士兵必须拒绝把他们硬拉到南越去替美帝国主义卖命，必须掉转枪口打敌人，以人民的名义惩罚敌人。声明说，这是他们能够免于一死和找到生路的唯一的爱国行动。声明要求美帝国主义必须立即停止对越南人民的一切战争行动，必须立即把它的侵略军和所有仆从军从越南南方撤出去。
    据新华社平壤六日电　据这里的报纸报道，美帝国主义最近不断向南朝鲜增运各种武器，加强南朝鲜傀儡军的装备，以便从这些傀儡军中抽出更多的人去南越当炮灰。
    据报道，美国在二月二十五日把一百二十艘战艇运到南朝鲜，交给了朴正熙集团的军队。去年十一月，美国已经把另外三十艘战艇运进南朝鲜。
    另据报道，美国政府不久前向朴正熙集团保证，在本财政年度完成三个南朝鲜后备师的装备更新，以便把它们改编成现役作战部队。
