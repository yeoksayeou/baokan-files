　　我们的购销站
　　李瑛
新人新事唱不完，唱唱咱们的购销站：
不挂牌子不挂匾，东村西村开分店，
乡亲有事尽管来，营业时间没规限。
东山的云呵西山的雨，来来去去挑两肩；
村南的坡呵村北的坎，铁打的脚板都踏烂。
早起担来两筐货，村头门板上堆个满：
有五金，有百货；随你挑，任你选；
队上要买喷雾器，他顺手掏出小零件，
修理完，一句话：“不该添的先别添！”
入晚收进两筐货，翻山涉水送回站：
有毛皮，有鲜蛋，顺带给社员把事办——
帮老五叔去修钟，替张二婶带把伞；
俱乐部要借手风琴，小学要买文具和算盘…
衣裳晒白鞋底烂，扁担越弯歌越欢；
尘土压，泥浆溅，大草帽子还是呼搧搧。
谁家老奶奶直赞叹：
  “风里滚，雨里钻，你一天到晚不得闲！”
售货员一听哈哈笑：
指指筐前的语录板——
“吃得苦，耐得劳，社会主义江山万万年！”

Our Purchasing and Marketing Station

New people and new deeds are endless to sing about, let's sing about our purchasing and marketing station:
No signs or plaques are hung, branch stores are opened in the east village and west village,
Villagers can come whenever they need, there are no fixed business hours.
The clouds of the east mountain and the rain of the west mountain, are carried back and forth on the shoulders;
The slopes south of the village and the ridges north of the village, are worn through by iron feet.
Early in the morning, two baskets of goods are carried in, piled high on the door plank at the village entrance:
There are hardware and general merchandise; pick and choose as you like;
If the team wants to buy a sprayer, he readily takes out small parts,
After repairing it, he says in one sentence: "Don't add anything you don't need!"
In the evening, two baskets of goods are collected, going back to the station over mountains and rivers:
There are furs and fresh eggs, and tasks are done for the commune members along the way—
Helping Uncle Lao Wu repair his clock, bringing an umbrella for Aunt Zhang Er;
The club wants to borrow an accordion, the primary school wants to buy stationery and an abacus…
Clothes are bleached by the sun and the soles of shoes are worn out, the carrying pole bends more and the songs become more cheerful;
Dust presses down, mud spatters, the large straw hat is still waved.
An old grandmother from a family constantly exclaims:
"Rolling in the wind, drilling in the rain, you're never idle all day long!"
The salesperson laughs heartily upon hearing this:
Pointing to the quotation board in front of the basket—
"Enduring hardship and toiling diligently, the socialist state will last for ten thousand years!"
