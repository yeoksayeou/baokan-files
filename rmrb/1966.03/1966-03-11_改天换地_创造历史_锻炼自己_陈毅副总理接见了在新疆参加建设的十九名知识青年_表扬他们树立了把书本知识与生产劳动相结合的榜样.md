    Transforming Heaven and Earth  Creating History  Tempering Oneself
    Vice Premier Chen Yi Receives Nineteen Educated Youths Participating in Construction in Xinjiang
    Praising Them for Setting an Example of Combining Book Knowledge with Productive Labor
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th—Vice Premier Chen Yi received nineteen educated youths from Shanghai and other regions participating in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps this morning. They had returned from Xinjiang to the mainland to study and report on their work.
    During the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi praised them for playing a leading role in the cause of educated youth participating in the socialist construction of the border regions, setting a good example of combining book knowledge with productive labor.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the vast number of young people in the interior, listening to Chairman Mao's words, obeying the needs of the revolution, and with lofty aspirations, went to Xinjiang to work with the local people of all ethnic groups to transform the Gobi Desert into oases of fertile land, and to build a socialist new Xinjiang. You are transforming heaven and earth, creating history, and at the same time tempering yourselves. This is the happiness of Chinese youth in the Mao Zedong era.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi, seeing these energetic young people, was very happy, shook hands warmly with each of them, and asked with concern about their labor, study, and living conditions in the border regions. When Vice Premier Chen Yi learned that these young people were activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, he said that if we want to make revolution, we must redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's works. We must learn and then use, practice, and always arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and continue to move forward.
    These young people reported to Vice Premier Chen Yi that most of them had attended middle school, and some had attended university. After being in Xinjiang for more than two years, they had already learned production knowledge such as planting cotton, growing rice, raising silkworms, herding sheep, and driving tractors. Now they are studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, establishing the viewpoint of farming for the revolution wholeheartedly.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi listened and said that this was very good. It is not enough for a person to only have book knowledge. With book knowledge, it must be combined with practice, so that people will become smarter. The young generation of New China must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve comprehensive development in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi encouraged the youth participating in border construction to first of all study Chairman Mao's works diligently, study and apply them flexibly, and work hard on the word "use." At the same time, they should continue to improve their culture, participate in sports activities, exercise well, master various production and combat skills, and contribute everything to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Lu Jindong, Secretary of the Secretariat, and others who participated in the meeting, took photos with everyone. (Attached picture)

    改天换地  创造历史  锻炼自己
    陈毅副总理接见了在新疆参加建设的十九名知识青年
    表扬他们树立了把书本知识与生产劳动相结合的榜样
    新华社十日讯  陈毅副总理今天上午接见了参加新疆生产建设兵团的上海和其他地区的十九名知识青年。他们是由新疆回到内地学习和汇报工作的。
    在接见的时候，陈毅副总理表扬他们在知识青年参加边疆社会主义建设的事业中起了带头作用，树立了把书本知识与生产劳动相结合的好榜样。
    陈毅副总理说，内地广大青年听毛主席的话，服从革命需要，胸怀壮志，到新疆去，同当地各族人民一起，把戈壁沙漠变成绿洲良田，建设社会主义的新新疆，你们是在改天换地，创造历史，同时也锻炼了自己。这是毛泽东时代中国青年的幸福。
    陈毅副总理看到这些生气蓬勃的年青人，非常高兴，同他们每一个人亲切握手，关切地询问了他们在边疆劳动、学习和生活的情况。当陈毅副总理知道这些年青人是学习毛主席著作的积极分子时，他说，我们要革命，就要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，学了就要用，要实践，要永远用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断前进。
    这些青年向陈毅副总理汇报说，他们当中，大部分人上过中学，有的上过大学，到新疆两年多，已经学习了植棉、种稻、养蚕、牧羊、驾驶拖拉机等生产知识。现在他们正大学毛主席著作，树立全心全意为革命种田的观点。
    陈毅副总理听了，说这很好。一个人光有书本知识是不够的。有了书本知识，必须和实践相结合，这样人就会变得聪明起来。新中国的年青的一代，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，获得全面的发展。
    陈毅副总理勉励参加边疆建设的青年，首先要努力学习毛主席著作，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，同时还要继续提高文化，参加体育活动，锻炼好身体，掌握各种生产和战斗的技能，为祖国社会主义建设贡献自己的一切。
    最后，陈毅副总理和参加接见的共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦，书记处书记路金栋等，同大家在一起照了相。（附图片）
