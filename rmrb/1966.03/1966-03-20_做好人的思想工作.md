    When the Xinhui County Agricultural Technical School recruits new students, it first clearly explains to the students the nature and mission of the school: students come from communes and teams, and after graduation, they will still return to the communes and teams to be new types of laborers. This approach is entirely correct.
    The educational goal of socialist schools is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This laborer uses both hands and brain, can be an engineering technician, and can also be a worker or farmer; can do mental labor and can also do physical labor.
    Some people say that some people are originally unwilling to study agriculture, and after studying in a part-time agricultural school, if they still become farmers, they will be even more unwilling to study agriculture. This statement underestimates the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants and educated youth. In the countryside, after the socialist education movement, the broad masses of peasants are carrying out basic farmland construction with the heroic spirit of transforming the world, harnessing mountains and rivers, developing agricultural production, and consolidating and developing the collective economy. They urgently need to learn cultural and technical knowledge, and urgently need a large number of talents with socialist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge to build a new socialist countryside. Look! How welcome the farmers of Xinhui County are to this! They said that such students are: "Roll up their sleeves to write, pull up their trouser legs to work in the fields, can handle cattle now, and will be able to operate machines in the future."
    Of course, due to the influence of habitual forces, there will be some obstacles when starting to do this. Didn't some teachers and parents at Xinhui Agricultural Technical School initially say, "You don't need to study to till the land, why study at an agricultural school!" Should people with knowledge not hold hoes anymore, and do people who hold hoes not need culture? Don't some people still retain the outdated idea of "those who excel in learning will become officials"? The task of the Communists is to revolutionize the ideas of the exploiting classes, to revolutionize the old habitual forces, and to educate the masses with the ideas of the proletariat and through persuasion and education. In response to the active thinking of teachers, students, and parents, Xinhui Agricultural Technical School raised questions such as "Do farmers need scientific knowledge?", "Does the countryside need technicians?", and "Is it a waste of talent to go back to be a farmer?", allowing teachers and students to debate; and organized teachers and students to go to the countryside for investigation and research, striving to run the school well. Through this work, the masses' understanding has been improved, and the number of students applying for such schools has greatly increased. This incident shows that as long as ideological work is done well and the truth is explained clearly, those who are affected by habitual forces can also accept the Party's education and change their wrong views.
    Education departments and educational administrative workers in various localities should learn from the experience of Xinhui County Agricultural Technical School, attach importance to doing good ideological work for people, and run the part-time agricultural education cause well.

    做好人的思想工作
    新会县农业技术学校招收新生的时候，先向学生讲清楚学校的性质和任务：学生从社队来，毕业后仍然回到社队去，作一个新型的劳动者。这种做法是完全正确的。
    社会主义学校的教育目的，是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这个劳动者，是手脑并用的，能当工程技术人员，也能当工人、农民；能脑力劳动，也能体力劳动。
    有人说，有些人本来就不愿意学农，在半农半读学校里学习以后，还是去当农民，他们就更不愿意学农了。这种说法，是对广大农民和知识青年的社会主义觉悟估计不足。在农村中，经过社会主义教育运动，广大农民正以改天换地的英雄气概，开展农田基本建设，治山治水，发展农业生产，巩固和发展集体经济。他们迫切需要学习文化技术知识，迫切需要有社会主义觉悟、有文化科学知识的大批人材，去建设社会主义的新农村。看！新会县的农民对于这样做是多么欢迎啊！他们说，这样的学生是：“翻转袖筒能写字，挽起裤管能下田，现在使得了牛，将来开得动机器。”
    当然，由于习惯势力的影响，在开始这样做的时候，是会遇到一些阻碍的。新会农业技术学校最初不是也有些教师和家长说，“耕田不用学，何必读农校！”有了知识的人就不应再拿锄头，而拿锄头的人不需要有文化吗？有的人不是仍然残留着“学而优则仕”的陈腐观念吗？共产党人的任务就是要去革剥削阶级思想的命，革旧习惯势力的命，就是要以无产阶级的思想，以说服教育的方法去教育群众。新会农业技术学校针对师生和家长的活思想，提出了“当农民要不要科学知识”、“农村需要不需要技术人员”、
  “回去当农民是不是浪费人材”等问题，让师生进行辩论；并且组织师生下乡调查研究，努力把学校办好。通过这些工作，群众的认识提高了，报考这种学校的学生大大地增加了。这件事说明，只要思想工作做得好，把道理讲清楚，那些受到习惯势力影响的人，也是能够接受党的教育，改变自己的错误看法的。
    各地教育部门、教育行政工作者，应当吸取新会县农业技术学校的经验，重视做好人的思想工作，把半农半读的教育事业办好。
