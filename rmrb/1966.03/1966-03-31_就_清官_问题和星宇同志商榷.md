    A Discussion with Comrade Xingyu on the Issue of "Upright Officials"
    Zhao Yimin
    Summary: "Upright officials" are a fictitious commonality in ideology used by feudal rulers to beautify themselves. The contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class is irreconcilable, therefore, "upright officials" cannot play the role of "self-regulation" in the feudal system. Comrade Xingyu believes that "upright officials" are sincerely sympathetic to the people in their subjective views, which is a statement that departs from class analysis. Legal rights and customary rights are not opposed. Negating the existence of "upright officials" does not mean treating all feudal officials the same.

    Comrade Xingyu once wrote an article on the historical issue of "upright officials," entitled "On 'Upright Officials'"①. He affirmed that there were "upright officials" in feudal society, and believed that: "Hai Rui and other 'upright officials,' consciously or unconsciously, acted as tools for the feudal ruling class to conduct self-regulation"; "upright officials" maintained the legal rights of the landlord class and cracked down on the customary rights of the powerful, which was beneficial to the working people; "upright officials" "showed a certain degree of sympathy, pity, and concern for the people," such as "Hai Rui, who said that the purpose of being an official was to seek justice for the poor," etc.

    I disagree with Comrade Xingyu's views. Now, I am writing down my different opinions for discussion with comrades.

      I. "Upright Official" is a "Fictitious Commonality"

    From a Marxist point of view, there were no "upright officials" in feudal society at all. "Upright official" is just a "fictitious commonality." It is purely a fabrication of the feudal emperors, bureaucrats, and landlord class. It appears on the ideological stage in the guise of being "just" and representing the interests of all classes, playing a role in beautifying the feudal regime, beautifying feudal society, and deceiving the people. It is the spiritual opium of the people. As long as you admit its existence, you will inevitably fall into an inextricable error. Comrade Xingyu is precisely like this, he believes that "upright officials" are not "derived from the deceptive fabrication of the rulers," but are actually existing.

    The reason why there were no "upright officials" in feudal society is determined by the insatiable nature of the feudal class. Feudal bureaucrats are the concentrated representatives of this nature. In the eyes of every bureaucrat, his purpose in ascending to the emperor's court is for personal wealth and prosperity. The saying in ancient Chinese books, "No official is not greedy, no clerk is not corrupt," reflects this universal law without exception. All feudal bureaucrats are parasitic tumors of feudal society, all-devouring jackals. Marx pointed out very concisely:

    "For the individual bureaucrat, the purpose of the state becomes his personal purpose, becomes the means for his promotion, enrichment, and prosperity"②. Marx did not say here that there were exceptional "upright officials."

      The proponents of the "upright official" theory believe: There were "upright officials" in Chinese feudal society thousands of years ago. If you don't believe it, look at the records in ancient books. And they assert that: "Historical records cannot be broken, because this is an objective existence that no one can break." Respected sir! You are wrong. Historical records are not objective existence, even if they fully conform to historical facts, they are only a reflection of objective existence. Moreover, these records are written by feudal historians who are often consciously or unconsciously distorting history due to the driving of class interests and class prejudices. Haven't even the landlord class themselves said, "It is better to have no book than to believe everything in it"? A person who claims to be a Marxist historian, on the contrary, says that it is an "objective existence that no one can break." On the contrary, I believe that historical records made by feudal historians can not only be broken, but must be broken, without breaking them, the original appearance of history cannot be restored. Our weapon for breaking it is Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought.

    So, since "upright officials" do not objectively exist, how is the "fictitious commonality" of "upright officials" in ideology produced?

    Feudal emperors and the landlord class are the creators and enthusiastic propagandists of "upright officials." The emperor hoped that his bureaucrats would all be "honest officials" and "upright officials," attempting to realize the beautiful dream of consolidating his rule and passing on the business for generations, increasing national treasury revenue, providing for his personal squandering, and satisfying his personal desires. Therefore, some emperors severely punished corruption. For example, Zhu Yuanzhang used extremely cruel punishments for bureaucrats who were severely corrupt. In the end, he still sighed quite a bit and said, "Since I ascended the throne, I have imitated the ancients and appointed officials, deployed in China and among the 'barbarians.' Hoping that when they are promoted and used, they will all be loyal and upright. After being employed for a long time, they are all corrupt and greedy." (《明朝小史》卷二) Since "they are all corrupt and greedy," why is there the title of "honest officials" and "upright officials"? This shows that the emperor also used two hands for his bureaucrats: one hand was to punish those who were severely corrupt; the other hand was to call those who were not too corrupt and had clever methods "honest officials" and "upright officials," and use "sacred instructions" and "imperial edicts" to commend them, as examples for other bureaucrats; at the same time, it could beautify his own rule and deceive the people. These are the two purposes of the emperor "manufacturing" and commending the so-called "upright officials." "Upright official" is also a political and moral coat used by feudal bureaucrats to beautify themselves. Corrupt officials, in order to deceive their superiors and subordinates, often claim to be "upright officials." Especially in the late feudal society, when the landlord class was approaching the boundary of death, the class contradictions were becoming increasingly acute, and they were even more painstakingly seeking help from this specter, as a life-saving straw to maintain the rule of their class. Therefore, they added artistic and sacred brilliance to the so-called "upright officials," put them on the stage, wrote some bizarre "public case" novels, and spared no effort to carry out extensive propaganda. They also knew that "the role of drama far exceeds that of books," especially for the uneducated peasants, it is the best way to carry out slavish education. Therefore, since the Yuan Dynasty, there have been "Three Trials of Butterfly Dream," "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," "Three Daughters Competing for the Board," and other "historical dramas," as well as novels such as "The Cases of Judge Bao," "The Big Red Robe," and "The Cases of Judge Shi." They attempted to put a sacred coat on people like Bao Zheng and Hai Rui to eliminate peasant resistance and save the demise of the landlord class.

    However, the broad masses of working people suffered from the exploitation of feudal bureaucrats. Real life tells the people: "The yamen gate opens to the south, if you have reason but no money, don't come in." As Lenin said: "The entire life of the peasants in the past has taught them to hate landlords and officials"③. This means that the peasants do not have illusions about feudal bureaucrats. Of course, the peasant class is also quite complex. Among peasants above the middle peasant level, some people may have certain illusions about feudal officials, but they are not the main body of the peasants. Even if the peasant class and the landlord class both think that there are "upright officials," it is still a "fictitious commonality." For example, ghosts and gods do not exist just because people in the past thought there were ghosts and gods. If some peasants believe that there are "upright officials" among feudal bureaucrats, it only shows that they have been deceived by the propaganda of the landlord class, and it can never lead to the conclusion that it is "not entirely a product of the fictitious ideal of the people."

    II. Are So-Called "Upright Officials" "Tools for Self-Regulation of the Feudal System"?

    The state is produced only when society is divided into irreconcilable hostile classes, but it "takes the form of a fictitious commonality"④. That is, from the surface, it seems to be the representative of the entire society. In reality, it is a machine for maintaining the exploiting class to oppress the exploited class. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "...The state apparatus is a tool for class oppression. For hostile classes, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, not something 'benevolent.'"⑤ The state apparatus of the feudal landlord class is a political tool for oppressing and suppressing peasants. They cannot exist for a single day without this violent organ. The so-called "upright official" is a component in the feudal state apparatus. We cannot leave this machine when studying it.

    Regrettably, Comrade Xingyu also departed from the Marxist theory of the state on this issue. When Comrade Xingyu wrote this article, he was trying to criticize Comrade Wu Han's absurd point of view that "upright officials" "stand on the side of the peasants" and "are the saviors of the people." However, he falsely set up another opposite side, adopted a means of eclecticism that hit each side equally, and provided a theoretical basis for Wu Han. Therefore, after Wu Han read his article, he said: "I agree with it very much, and I am very happy," and its "basic point of view is exactly my point of view," and praised Comrade Xingyu for "discussing this issue clearly." Comrade Xingyu's main point of view is: "Upright officials" "are tools for self-regulation of the feudal system"; "The feudal rule is trapped in this insurmountable contradiction, it must carry out some self-regulation in order to continue its own existence. Hai Rui and other 'upright officials,' consciously or unconsciously, acted as tools for the feudal ruling class to conduct self-regulation." The question here is, who and whose contradictions are being regulated? Comrade Xingyu believes that "upright officials" crack down on the powerful who excessively exploit the peasants beyond their legal rights. Obviously, the role of the so-called "tool for self-regulation of the feudal system" is to regulate the insurmountable contradiction between the landlord class and the peasant class. According to Comrade Xingyu's view, it seems that the emergence of the so-called "upright officials" can actually regulate the insurmountable contradictions between the two opposing classes of peasants and landlords in feudal society. This is difficult to agree with. Here, it is necessary to clarify the following issues.

    First, can the contradictions in feudal society be reconciled or regulated (here, reconciliation and regulation are synonymous - author's note)? I believe that the main contradiction in feudal society is the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. This contradiction is irreconcilable and cannot be regulated because it is an antagonistic contradiction.

    Second, is the feudal state a tool for regulating the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class? The Marxist theory of the state tells us that the feudal state is a product of the irreconcilable contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. It is not a regulator of class contradictions at all, but a tool for the landlord class to oppress the peasant class, and a violent organ for suppressing peasants. Therefore, when the peasants revolt, they always point the spearhead at the feudal state, with the aim of overthrowing the feudal state. Countless historical facts have already illustrated this point.

    Third, are the so-called "upright officials" regulators of the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class? I believe that the so-called "upright officials," in essence, are the same as corrupt officials. They are also components in the feudal state apparatus, and executioners who slaughter peasants. They are not regulators of class contradictions at all. Just looking at a passage from Hai Rui, who enjoyed the reputation of "upright official," in his "Further Notice on the Baojia Law" when he was the magistrate of Chun'an, you can see it at a glance. He said: "In the past, mining workers and poor people planned for food and clothing, and their feelings were still excusable. Now, robbing villages and killing people is an unforgivable crime. You can defend and capture with all your heart. Those who resist arrest will be killed immediately. If they do not die to the enemy, they will die by the law. Dying to the enemy is a loyal and righteous soldier, and dying to the law is a foolish and stubborn person. You should think about it, and do not leave behind guilt and remorse." (《海瑞集》上册，第一八五页) It can be seen from this passage that Hai Rui did not regulate the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. At that time, some peasants in Chun'an County took up arms to oppose them, killed their people, and deprived them of their property. Hai Rui ordered his local soldiers to "defend and capture," and "those who resist arrest will be killed immediately. If they do not die to the enemy, they will die by the law." How sharp the class struggle is, it has developed into a life-and-death armed struggle. Here, what Hai Rui played was not the role of a class contradiction regulator, but the function of an executioner. It can be seen that Comrade Xingyu's point of view is completely inconsistent with historical facts, and unconsciously falls into the quagmire of the theory of class contradiction reconciliation.

    In fact, this point of view is not something new, it is the same old tune that the bourgeois theory of social solidarity state has sung. In the face of irrefutable historical facts, they had to admit that there is a state only where there are classes and class struggles. However, they took a step back and held on to their position, saying that "the state is an organ for reconciling class contradictions," in order to cover up the class essence of the state and deceive the working people. These old tunes were refuted beyond recognition by Lenin more than forty years ago. Even so, as long as there is a bourgeoisie, it will always refuse to automatically withdraw from this position and give up this point of view. For example, Zhang Zhiben, a reactionary bureaucrat of the Kuomintang, also said: "The purpose of establishing a state should be to reconcile class conflicts, in order to promote the common interests of society." (《宪法论》, page 11)

    Comrade Xingyu said: "Hai Rui said that the purpose of being an official was to seek justice for the poor, he said: 'Whenever people in the world see people suffering from hunger, cold, and disease, they must mourn for them; whenever people in the world see people suffering from injustice and depression that cannot be resolved, they must be indignant for them. Mourning for them and being indignant for them, the feelings cannot be stopped, this is the origin of being an official' (《海瑞集》上册，第三七页). When 'upright officials' say this kind of thing, they may be completely sincere subjectively." This point of view is even more absurd. Working for the poor is the worldview of the proletariat, and Hai Rui could not have such a worldview. Dialectical materialists believe that the evaluation of a person is not based on what he expresses, but on his practical activities. Let's take a look at what Hai Rui did! In his letter to Liu Shipu, he said: "The crafty lawsuits in Wuzhong are completely trivial matters, but they are described as earth-shattering, which is really shocking and frightening. I have never failed to deal with them severely. In addition to sending them to the prefecture and county, there are always seven or eight people in shackles in front of the yamen, and they are severely beaten and tortured, and after a month, they are sent to the post station as exiles. There have been two or three cases of extradition for interrogation, but all the plaintiffs escaped halfway, and the escorts said that they had heard of this severe punishment. I was very happy, thinking that it could eliminate crafty lawsuits." (《海瑞集》下册，第四四○页) What is a "crafty lawsuit"? Hai Rui said: "The folk customs are cunning and dangerous." It can be seen that "crafty lawsuit" is a lawsuit of cunning people, that is, undoubtedly a lawsuit of poor people. The poor people go to court, nothing more than because of "hunger, cold, and disease" or "injustice and depression that cannot be resolved." However, Hai Rui called it a "crafty lawsuit," and thought that this trend should not be allowed to grow, so he inflicted cruel punishments on them, and even "after a month, they are sent to the post station as exiles." Moreover, he knew that the poor people who went to court were scared away halfway, and was very happy. It can be seen that Hai Rui's "serving as an official" for "injustice and depression that cannot be resolved" is nothing more than a magnificent and embellishing term in the feudal officialdom. However, Comrade Xingyu believes that these words "may be completely sincere," and its purpose is still to prove that Hai Rui is a "tool for self-regulation of the feudal system." This cannot prove anything else, but can only further show that Comrade Xingyu has departed from class analysis.

    It must also be pointed out that Comrade Xingyu also adopted a means of eclecticism on this issue. On the one hand, he quoted a passage from Comrade Mao Zedong, vaguely saying that "there is no love without a reason"; on the other hand, he used the method of distorting Marx's words to affirm that the so-called "upright officials" "show a certain degree of sympathy, pity, and concern for the people" in terms of "subjective ideological form," and that these ideas "may be completely sincere." In order to clarify this issue, we quote the entire passage that has been distorted by Comrade Xingyu and analyze it. Marx said: "On different forms of ownership, on the social conditions of existence, stands a whole superstructure composed of different emotions, fantasies, ways of thinking, and worldviews. The entire class creates and constitutes all this on the basis of its material conditions and corresponding social relations. Individuals who have inherited these emotions and viewpoints through tradition and education will think that these emotions and viewpoints are the true motives and starting points of their behavior. ...In historical battles, it is even more necessary to distinguish the words and fantasies of the various parties from their true faces and actual interests, and to distinguish their views on themselves from their true essence."⑥ Here, Marx clearly pointed out the following two issues to us.

    First, social existence determines people's consciousness. In class society, different classes have different thoughts, emotions, and political viewpoints, etc., but it also has relative independence and inheritance. Before the emergence of Marxism, people often thought that their actions were not dominated by material living conditions, and often regarded the requirements of "tradition and education" as the "starting point" of his actions. This passage of Marx clearly illustrates this issue. It reveals the class struggle covered up under the "tradition and education," and reveals the class nature and deception of all exploiting classes' "tradition and education." However, Comrade Xingyu used it to show that the so-called "upright officials" "show a certain degree of sympathy, pity, and concern for the people," and that these ideas "may be completely sincere." What is this if it is not distortion? Isn't this making the "tradition and education" of the feudal class super-class?

    Second, when studying historical figures, their practical activities should be used as the basis for evaluation. Marx tells us that we must distinguish their words and fantasies from their true faces and actual interests, and distinguish their views on themselves from their essence. This is what it means. After Comrade Xingyu quoted this passage with the beginning and end cut off, he judged it based on the so-called "upright officials'" views on themselves and their words, and regarded their officialdom facade words as their subjective ideological form, and as the standard for evaluating them. Therefore, it will inevitably lead to wrong conclusions.

    III. Do So-Called "Upright Officials" Use Feudal Law as a Weapon to Oppose Feudal Customary Law?

    The so-called "upright officials" use feudal law to oppose feudal customary law, thereby playing the role of a tool for regulating class contradictions. This is the basic thread in Comrade Xingyu's article "On 'Upright Officials.'" Below, I will talk about my simple views on these issues.

    First, the issue of understanding feudal law. When Comrade Xingyu explained the essence of feudal law, he said: "The greed of the rulers always encounters certain limits. ...Generally speaking, what the law reflects and maintains is the ruling right that does not excessively exceed this limit. ...If the degree of exploitation exceeds this limit, it will cause the rule of a certain group to collapse and lead to the alternation of old and new dynasties." This means that the degree of exploitation and oppression of the feudal rulers will not cause peasant uprisings and peasant wars as long as it does not excessively exceed the limits of feudal law, and the rule of a certain feudal ruling group will not collapse. The reason why the alternation of old and new dynasties occurred in Chinese history was caused by the landlord class excessively exceeding the limits of feudal law. Please see: In Comrade Xingyu's writing, the feudal law, like the feudal state and the feudal bureaucrats, has also become a regulator of class contradictions.

    At the same time, in Comrade Xingyu's view, the reason why the so-called "upright officials" can play the role of regulating class contradictions is that they resolutely maintain feudal law and oppose feudal customary law.

    Here, we must uncover the mystery of feudal law. I believe that law, like the state, is produced in the case of irreconcilable class contradictions. Feudal law is the expression of the will of the landlord class that has been elevated to law. It is arbitrary, privileged, and unrestricted. Under this law, the peasants do not have any political rights, and the landlords have the right to arbitrarily beat, scold, and even execute the peasants. The "order" established under this oppressive law does not regulate class contradictions, but is a manifestation of class contradictions. It is the "order" that the landlord class uses the state apparatus as a lever to force the peasants to maintain. The emperor and the bureaucrats are the executors of this oppressive law. Therefore, the contradiction between the peasants and the feudal law is irreconcilable. After the peasant war breaks out, it will not only overthrow the feudal state, but also abolish the feudal law. However, Comrade Xingyu is praising it, saying that it can reconcile the contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class. What does he base it on? There is a basis, that is, the pragmatist legal theory.

    Second, the relationship between feudal law and feudal customary law. Although Comrade Xingyu said, "The two depend on each other and are opposed to each other," he actually opposes feudal law and feudal customary law, and believes that the essence of "upright officials" is to oppose feudal customary law with feudal law. From the opposition between the two, Comrade Xingyu found a place for the so-called "upright officials" to operate, and found a theoretical basis for the so-called "upright officials" being "regulators" of class contradictions. I believe that this view is not Marxist. Let's study the arguments put forward by Comrade Xingyu below.

    First, in order to prove the opposition between feudal law and feudal customary law, Comrade Xingyu once quoted this passage from Marx: "Here, and everywhere, the interests of the ruling class of society are always to make the status quo, as law, sacred and inviolable, and to fix its various restrictions fixed by custom and tradition as restrictions of law."⑦ That's right, Marx distinguished customary law from law here, but Marx emphasized their consistency, that is, they "always make the status quo, as law, sacred and inviolable." It can be seen that they are not opposed to each other. Comrade Xingyu completely distorted Marx's words.

    Second, Comrade Xingyu also quoted another passage from Marx: "One must never defend these customary rights against the law. On the contrary, they should be abolished as something opposed to the law, and those who use these customary rights should also be given some punishment."⑧ Comrade Xingyu used this as a basis to affirm that opposing feudal customary law with feudal law is "the essence of the political phenomenon of 'upright officials.'" I believe that this is the greatest distortion. This article was written by Marx in 1842. At that time, Marx was still a democrat and had not yet established the Marxist theory of the state. Marx wrote this article to defend the customary rights of the poor. At that time, the German working class was not yet a class for itself, and the broad masses of working people were not yet conscious. Marx was calling on the German poor to rise up and fight against the German feudal rulers to defend their customary rights. Here, Marx not only simply opposed feudal customary law, but also opposed German feudal law and the feudal system. Isn't Comrade Xingyu confusing the boundaries between the dog-eat-dog within the landlord class and the people's revolutionary struggle? Isn't this a distortion of Marxism?

    We do not deny that there is a difference between more law-abiding and less law-abiding among feudal bureaucrats, but this is not the standard for dividing the so-called "upright officials" and corrupt officials, and even less can we regard the more law-abiding feudal bureaucrats as self-regulators of the feudal system. Otherwise, where would we place the feudal law?

    IV. Does Negating the Existence of "Upright Officials" Mean Treating All Feudal Officials the Same?

    Some people believe that not admitting the distinction between "upright officials" and corrupt officials among feudal bureaucrats means treating all feudal bureaucrats the same, and not "dividing one into two," so Qin Hui and Yue Fei are no different. What a big hat! Unfortunately, this statement is purely sophistry. We have to ask, which of the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism told them that when evaluating feudal bureaucrats, it is necessary to distinguish between "upright officials" and corrupt officials? Isn't this distinction a concept copied and transferred from the landlord class's history books, literary works, and drama works? This point was explained at the beginning of Comrade Xingyu's article "On 'Upright Officials.'" Using the standards of the landlord class to distinguish its bureaucrats as the basis for the proletariat to study feudal bureaucrats, can this be considered "dividing one into two"?

    We treat all feudal bureaucrats the same, but not completely the same. Because all feudal bureaucrats are parasitic tumors of feudal society, they are all corrupt officials and tools of the dictatorship of the landlord class, this is its fundamental aspect. Therefore, I suggest removing the hats of "upright officials" from this group of feudal bureaucrats represented by Bao Zheng and Hai Rui, and eliminating the concept of "upright officials" in the Marxist historical science. However, we cannot treat them completely the same, this is another question, that is, how to evaluate historical figures. For example, we affirm that Yue Fei is a hero, not because he was an "upright official," but because he resisted the invasion of the backward Jin people and once played a role in promoting history. The same is true for Hai Rui. He repaired the Wusong River, which played a certain role in the production development of the Yingtian Prefecture area at that time, but he was not an "upright official."

    In history, no class has ever respected history more than the proletariat, and no class can give a scientific summary and evaluation of history and historical figures like the proletariat. We will never deny that history is created by people, nor will we deny that individual figures have played a certain role in history. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, give them a critical summary "from Confucius to Sun Yat-sen," in order to "inherit this precious heritage" and "guide the current great movement." This requires us to have the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method when criticizing, and must be combined with the current great struggle; and we must never create a standard out of nothing like the "upright official" theorists, or use the standards of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie to evaluate feudal bureaucrats, pull out Hai Rui and others, and praise and sing praises. This is not critical inheritance, this is the revival of old things. Therefore, we must give the "upright official" theory a serious criticism.

### 就“清官”问题和星宇同志商榷

专栏：

    就“清官”问题和星宇同志商榷
    赵一民
    提要  “清官”是封建统治者用来美化自己的意识形态上虚幻的共同体。农民阶级同地主阶级的矛盾是不可调和的，因此，“清官”不能起到封建制度“自我调节”的作用。星宇同志认为，“清官”同情人民在主观上是真诚的，这是离开阶级分析的说法。法定权利同习惯权利不是对立的。否定“清官”的存在，不是把封建官吏一律看待。
    关于历史上的“清官”问题，星宇同志曾写过一篇文章，题目叫做《论“清官”》①。他肯定在封建社会里是有“清官”的，并认为：“海瑞和其他‘清官’一样，都是自觉或不自觉地充当着封建统治进行自我调节的工具”；“清官”维护地主阶级的法定权利，打击豪强的习惯权利，对于劳动人民有好处；“清官”们“对人民群众表现一定的同情、怜悯和关心”，如“海瑞则把做官的目的说成为贫苦人民打抱不平”，等等。
    我不同意星宇同志的观点，现在，把我的不同意见写出来，和同志们讨论。
      一、“清官”是一个“虚幻的共同体”
    从马克思主义的观点来看，在封建社会里根本没有“清官”，“清官”不过是一个“虚幻的共同体”。它纯粹是封建皇帝、官僚和地主阶级的虚构。它以“公正”的、代表各阶级利益的姿态出现在意识形态的舞台上，起着美化封建政权，美化封建社会，欺骗人民的作用。它是人民的精神鸦片。只要承认它的存在，就必然陷入不能自拔的错误之中。星宇同志正是这样，他认为“清官”不是“出自统治者欺骗性的虚构”，而是真实存在的。
    在封建社会里所以没有“清官”，这是由封建阶级贪得无厌的本性所决定的。封建官僚是这种本性的集中代表者，在每一个官僚看来，他登上天子之堂的目的，就是为了个人的发财致富，飞黄腾达。中国古书中“无官不贪，无吏不污”的话，正反映了这一普遍的规律，无一例外。所有的封建官僚都是封建社会的寄生赘瘤，吞噬一切的豺狼。马克思极为概括的指出：
  “就单个的官僚来说，国家的目的变成了他的个人目的，变成了他升官发财、飞黄腾达的手段”②。马克思在这里并没有说还有例外的“清官”。
      “清官论”者认为：在千百年以前，中国封建社会里有“清官”，不信你看古籍中有记载。并且肯定地说：“历史记载是冲不破的，因为这是客观存在，谁也冲不破”。可敬的先生！你说错了，历史记载不是客观存在，即使它完全符合历史的事实，也不过是客观存在的反映。何况这些记载又是出自地主阶级的历史学家之手，他们由于受阶级利益、阶级偏见的驱使，经常自觉不自觉地歪曲历史。不是连地主阶级自己都说过“尽信书不如无书”吗？以马克思主义史学家自命的人，反倒说它是“客观存在，谁也冲不破”。恰恰相反，我认为，对封建史学家所做的历史记载，不仅能冲破，而且必须冲破，不冲破它，就不能恢复历史的本来面目。我们冲破它的武器，就是马克思主义、毛泽东思想。
    那么，客观上既然不存在“清官”，做为“清官”这种意识形态上的“虚幻的共同体”是怎样产生的呢？
    封建皇帝和地主阶级是“清官”的创造者和热烈的宣传者。皇帝希望他的官僚都是“廉吏”、“清官”，企图实现巩固其统治，传万世之业的美梦，以增加国库收入，供给他个人挥霍，满足其私欲。所以，有些皇帝曾严惩过贪污。如朱元璋曾对于奸贪严重的官僚，使用了极为残酷的刑法。最后，他还是颇为慨叹地说：“朕自即位以来，法古命官，布列华、‘夷’。期其擢用之时，并效忠贞，任用既久，俱系奸贪。”（《明朝小史》卷二）既然“俱系奸贪”，为什么又有“廉吏”、“清官”之称呢？这正说明了皇帝对其官僚也是用两手的：一手是惩办贪污严重者；另一手是对贪污不太严重而手段又巧妙者，称之为“廉吏”、“清官”，并用“圣训”、“谕旨”表彰他们，做为其他官僚的榜样；同时，又可以美化自己的统治，欺骗人民。这就是皇帝“制造”和表彰所谓“清官”的两个目的。“清官”也是封建官僚用来美化自己的政治和道德的外衣。贪官们为了欺上骗下，往往都以“清官”自命。特别是到了封建社会的末期，地主阶级接近于死亡的边境时，阶级矛盾日益尖锐化，他们更加千方百计地求助这一幽灵，做为维持本阶级统治的救命草。因之，他们便给所谓“清官”加上了艺术的、神圣的光彩，搬上了舞台，写了一些离奇古怪的“公案”小说，不遗余力地进行扩大宣传。他们也知道，“戏剧的作用远远超过了书本”，特别是对于没有文化的农民来说，更是进行奴化教育的最好方式。所以，自元以后，便出现了《三勘蝴蝶梦》、《灰栏记》、《三女抢板》等“历史剧”，以及《包公案》、《大红袍》、《施公案》等小说。他们企图给包拯、海瑞之流穿上神圣的外衣，来消灭农民的反抗，挽救地主阶级的危亡。
    但是，广大劳动人民身受封建官僚的压榨。现实生活告诉人民：“衙门口朝南开，有理无钱莫进来”。正如列宁所说的：“农民过去的全部生活教会他们憎恨老爷和官吏”③。这就是说，农民对封建官僚不抱有幻想。当然，农民这个阶级也是相当复杂的，在中农以上的农民中，可能有些人对于封建官吏抱有一定的幻想，但他们并不是农民的主体。退一步说，即使农民阶级和地主阶级都认为有“清官”，它仍然是“虚幻的共同体”。比如鬼神，并不因为过去的人们认为有鬼神，它就存在了。农民中有人相信封建官僚中有“清官”，这不过表明他们受了地主阶级宣传的欺骗而已，也决不能得出“不完全是人民群众虚幻理想的产物”的结论来。
    二、所谓“清官”是不是“封建制度自我
        调节的工具”？
    国家是当社会分裂为不可调和的敌对阶级时才产生的，但它又“采取一种虚幻的共同体的形式”④出现。即从表面上看，它好似整个社会的代表，实际上，它是维护剥削阶级压迫被剥削阶级的机器。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“……国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”⑤封建地主阶级的国家机器，是压迫和镇压农民的政治工具，他们如果没有这一暴力机关，一天也无法存在。所谓“清官”是封建国家机器中的一个机件。我们在研究它时不能离开这架机器。
    令人遗憾的是，星宇同志在这个问题上，也离开了马克思主义的国家学说。星宇同志在写这篇文章时，是企图批判吴晗同志的“清官”是“站在农民一边”、“是人民的救星”的荒谬论点。但他又虚设了另一个对立面，采取各打五十大板的折衷主义的手段，为吴晗提供了理论基础。所以，吴晗同志看了他的文章后说：“我都很赞成，并且很高兴”，其“基本论点，也正好是我的论点”，并表扬星宇同志“把这个问题论述清楚了”。星宇同志主要论点是：“清官”“是封建制度自我调节的工具”；“封建统治陷在这种不可克服的矛盾之中，它必须进行某种自我调节，才能够延续自己的存在。海瑞和其他‘清官’一样，都是自觉或不自觉地充当着封建统治进行自我调节的工具”。这里的问题是，调节谁和谁的矛盾呢？星宇同志认为，“清官”打击超出法定权利而过分剥削农民的豪强，很显然，所谓“封建制度的自我调节工具”的作用，就是调节地主阶级和农民阶级的不可克服的矛盾。按照星宇同志的说法，似乎所谓“清官”的出现，竟然可以调节封建社会中农民和地主两个对立阶级之间的不可克服的矛盾。这是很难令人同意的。这里，需要弄清以下几个问题。
    第一，封建社会里的矛盾是不是可以调和或调节（在这里调和与调节是同义语——作者注）呢？我认为，在封建社会里的主要矛盾，是农民阶级和地主阶级的矛盾，这种矛盾是不可调和，也不能调节的，因为它是对抗性的矛盾。
    第二，封建国家是不是调节农民阶级和地主阶级矛盾的工具呢？马克思主义的国家学说告诉我们，封建国家是农民阶级与地主阶级的矛盾不可调和的产物，它根本不是什么阶级矛盾的调节器，而是地主阶级压迫农民阶级的工具，镇压农民的暴力机关。因之，农民起义时，总是把矛头指向封建国家，以打倒封建国家为目的。无数的历史事实早已说明了这一点。
    第三，所谓“清官”是不是农民阶级与地主阶级矛盾的调节器呢？我认为，所谓“清官”实质上和贪官一样，也是封建国家机器中的一个机件，是屠杀农民的刽子手，根本不是什么阶级矛盾的调节器。只要看一看享有“清官”盛誉的海瑞，在任淳安知县时发布的《保甲法再示》中的一段话，便一目了然了。他说：“前日矿徒穷民，计图衣食，情犹可恕。今劫村杀人，罪不容诛矣。尔等可一心力防捕。拒捕者，随即杀之。不死于敌，必死于法。死敌为忠义士，死法为愚顽民。尔等试思，毋贻罪悔。”（《海瑞集》上册，第一八五页）从这一段话中可看出，海瑞并没有调节农民阶级与地主阶级的矛盾。当时，在淳安县就有些农民拿起武器来反对他们，杀他们的人，剥夺他们的财产。海瑞给他的乡兵们下令，要“防捕”，“拒捕者，随即杀之，不死于敌，必死于法”。阶级斗争是多么尖锐，已经发展到你死我活的武装斗争了。在这里，海瑞所发挥的不是阶级矛盾调节器的作用，而是刽子手的职能。可见，星宇同志的观点是完全不符合历史事实的，并且不自觉地陷入阶级矛盾调和论的泥坑了。
    其实，这种观点并不是什么新鲜的东西，是资产阶级的社会连带主义国家学说已唱熟了的滥调。他们在无可辩驳的历史事实面前不得不承认，只有存在阶级和阶级斗争的地方才有国家，但他们又退了一步固守住自己的阵地，说什么“国家是调和阶级矛盾的机关”，以用此来掩饰国家的阶级本质，欺骗劳动人民。这些滥调在四十多年前已被列宁驳得体无完肤了。即使如此，只要还有资产阶级，它总是不肯自动的退出这一阵地，放弃这种观点。如国民党的反动官僚张知本还说过：“建立国家之目的，应该为调和阶级冲突，以谋社会共同利益之进展。”（《宪法论》，第十一页）
    星宇同志说：“海瑞把做官的目的说成为贫苦人民打抱不平，他说：‘举凡天下之人，见天下之有饥寒疾苦者必哀之；见天下之有冤抑沉郁不得其平者必为忿之。哀之忿之，情不能已，仕之所由来也’（《海瑞集》上册，第三七页）。‘清官’们在讲这种话的时候，主观上可能完全是真诚的”。这种观点更为荒诞。为贫苦人民而工作是无产阶级的世界观，海瑞不可能有这样的世界观。辩证唯物主义者认为，评价一个人不是看他表白的什么，而是要看他的实践活动。还是让我们看看海瑞的所作所为吧！在他给刘石圃的信中说：“吴中刁讼，略无分毫事情而驾为天大之说，诚可骇畏。生亦未尝不重处也。除发府县外，衙门前尝不绝七八人枷号，又先痛打夹苦之，候月满发驿充徒。曾有解审二三起，俱原告中途脱逃，解人告称，闻此重处声也。生心喜之，谓可以消息刁讼矣。”（《海瑞集》下册，第四四○页）什么是“刁讼”？海瑞说过：“民风刁险”，可见“刁讼”是刁民之讼，即是贫苦人民之讼无疑了。贫苦人民去打官司，无非是因为“饥寒疾苦”或“冤抑沉郁不得其平”。而海瑞却把它称为“刁讼”，还认为此风不可长，便对他们施以酷刑，甚至“候月满发驿充徒”。并且，他知道去打官司的贫苦人民走到半路便被吓跑了，非常高兴。可见，海瑞的为“有冤抑沉郁不得其平”而“仕之”，不过是封建官场上冠冕堂皇的粉饰之词而已。而星宇同志却认为，这些话“可能完全是真诚的”，其目的还是在于证明海瑞是“封建制度自我调节的工具”。这不能证明什么别的，而只能更加表现了星宇同志离开了阶级分析。
    还必须指出的是，星宇同志在这个问题上，也采取了折衷主义的手段。他一方面引用了毛泽东同志的一段话，含糊其辞的说“没有无缘无故的爱”；另一方面，他又用曲解马克思的话的办法，肯定了所谓“清官”们“在主观思想形式方面对人民群众表现一定的同情、怜悯和关心”等等思想，“可能完全是真诚的”。为了弄清楚这一个问题，我们把被星宇同志曲解了的这一段话全引出来，加以分析。马克思说：“在不同的所有制形式上，在生存的社会条件上，耸立着由各种不同情感、幻想、思想方式和世界观构成的整个上层建筑。整个阶级在它的物质条件和相应的社会关系的基础上创造和构成这一切。通过传统和教育承受了这些情感和观点的个人，会以为这些情感和观点就是他的行为的真实动机和出发点。……在历史的战斗中更应该把各个党派的言辞和幻想同它们的本来面目和实际利益区别开来，把它们对自己的看法同它们的真实本质区别开来。”⑥在这里，马克思清楚地给我们指出了以下两个问题。
    其一，社会存在决定人们的意识。在阶级社会里，不同的阶级有不同的思想、情感和政治观点等，但是它又有相对的独立性和继承性。在马克思主义产生以前，人们往往认为自己的行动不受物质生活条件所支配，常常把那些“传统和教育”的要求，当作他行动的“出发点”。马克思这一段话，清楚地说明了这一问题。揭露了在“传统和教育”下遮蔽着的阶级斗争，揭露了一切剥削阶级的“传统和教育”的阶级性和欺骗性。而星宇同志却用它来说明，所谓“清官”们“对人民群众表现一定的同情、怜悯和关心”，“可能完全是真诚的”，这不是曲解又是什么？这难道不是把封建阶级的“传统和教育”超阶级化了吗？
    其二，在研究历史人物时，要根据他们的实践活动进行评价。马克思告诉我们，必须把他们的言辞和幻想同他们的本来面目和实际利益区别开来，把他们对自己的看法同他们的本质区别开来，就是这个意思。星宇同志对这段做了剪头去尾引证后，便根据所谓“清官”们对于自己的看法和言辞加以判断，把他们的官场门面话，当作他们的主观思想形式，当作评价他们的标准。因之，必然会作出错误的结论来。
    三、所谓“清官”是否以封建定法为武器，
          反对封建的习惯法？
    所谓“清官”是用封建定法，反对封建习惯法，从而发挥其调节阶级矛盾的工具的作用，这是星宇同志《论“清官”》一文中的基本线索。下边我谈谈对这些问题的简单看法。
    第一，对于封建定法的理解问题。星宇同志在解释封建定法的本质时说：“统治者的贪欲却总是要碰到一定的界限。……一般来说，法律所反映、所维护的就是不过分超越这个界限的统治权利。……如果剥削程度超过了这界限。那会使得一定集团的统治趋于崩溃而出现新旧王朝的更替”。这就是说，封建统治者的剥削和压迫的程度，只要不过分地超越封建定法的界限，便不会引起农民的起义和农民的战争来，一定的封建统治集团的统治就不会崩溃。中国历史上所以出现了新旧王朝的更替，是地主阶级过分地超越了封建定法的界限造成的。请看：在星宇同志的笔下，封建王法和封建国家、封建官僚一样，也成为阶级矛盾的调节器了。
    同时，在星宇同志看来，所谓“清官”所以能起调节阶级矛盾的作用，就在于它坚决维护封建定法，反对封建的习惯法。
    在这里，我们必须揭开封建定法的迷。我认为，法与国家一样，是在阶级矛盾不可调和的情况下产生的，封建定法是被提升为法律的地主阶级意志的表现，它是武断的、特权的、不受任何限制的。在这种法律下农民没有任何政治权利，地主对农民有随意打骂甚至处死的权利。在这种压迫法下建立起来的“秩序”，并没有调节阶级矛盾，正是阶级矛盾的表现。它是地主阶级利用国家机器做杠杆，强迫农民维持下来的“秩序”，皇帝和官僚都是这种压迫法执行者。因之，农民与封建定法的矛盾是不可调和的，农民战争爆发后，它不仅要打倒封建国家，也要废除封建定法。而星宇同志却在赞美它，说它是可以调和农民与地主阶级矛盾的。还说什么只要封建统治者，不过分超越它所规定的界限，就不会引起农民起义来。其根据在哪里呢？根据是有的，那就是实用主义法律学说。
    第二，关于封建定法和封建习惯法的关系问题。星宇同志虽然说过，“两者互相依存而又互相对立”，但他实际上是把封建定法和封建习惯法对立起来，并认为“清官”的本质就是用封建定法反对封建的习惯法。从两者的对立中，星宇同志便给所谓“清官”找到了活动的地盘，给所谓“清官”是阶级矛盾的“调节器”找到了理论根据。我认为，这种看法不是马克思主义的。下面来研究一下星宇同志提出的论据。
    其一，星宇同志为了证明封建定法和封建习惯法的对立，曾经引用过马克思的这一段话：“在这里，和在到处一样，社会的统治阶级的利益关系，总是要使现状，当作法律，成为神圣不可侵犯的，并且要把它的由习惯和传统而固定化的各种限制，当作法律的限制固定下来。”⑦不错，马克思在这里是区分了习惯法与定法，但是马克思强调的是它们的一致性，即它们
  “总是要使现状，当作法律，成为神圣不可侵犯的”。可见，它们之间不是对立的。星宇同志完全是曲解了马克思的话。
    其二，星宇同志还引用过马克思另一段话：“决不能维护这些习惯权利而对抗法律，相反地，应该把它们当做和法律对立的东西废除，而对利用这些习惯权利的人也应该给以某种惩罚。”⑧星宇同志以此为据，便肯定以封建定法反对封建习惯法，是“‘清官’这一政治现象的本质”。我认为，这是最大的曲解。这篇文章，是马克思在一八四二年写的，当时马克思还是一个民主主义者，还远没有建立马克思主义的国家学说。马克思写这篇文章，是为贫民的习惯权利作辩护的。当时，德国工人阶级还不是一个自为的阶级，广大的劳动人民还不觉悟，马克思是在号召德国的贫民起来，向德国的封建统治者进行斗争，维护自己的习惯权利。马克思在这里不仅单纯反对封建习惯法，也反对了德国的封建定法和封建制度。星宇同志不是混淆了地主阶级内部的狗咬狗和人民革命斗争的界限？不是对马克思主义的歪曲吗？
    我们并不否认在封建官僚中有较守法和不守法的区别，但这不是划分所谓“清官”与贪官的标准，更不能把较为守法的封建官僚当作封建制度的自我调节器，否则又把封建王法置于何地呢？
    四、否定“清官”的存在，是不是把所有
          封建官吏一律看待？
    有的人认为，不承认封建官僚中有“清官”和贪官之分，就是对封建官僚都一律看待，不是“一分为二”，这样秦桧与岳飞便没有什么区别了。好大的帽子啊！可惜这种说法是纯粹的诡辩。我们要问一句，马克思列宁主义的经典著作家们那一位告诉过他们，在评价封建官僚时，必须区分出“清官”和贪官来？这种区分难道不是从地主阶级的史书、文学作品和戏剧作品中，照抄照转来的概念吗？这一点，在星宇同志的《论“清官”》的文章中开始就说明了。以地主阶级区分它的官僚的标准，做为无产阶级研究封建官僚的根据，这能算是“一分为二”吗？
    我们对于所有封建官僚是一律看待，但又不完全一律看待。因为，所有封建官僚都是封建社会的寄生赘瘤，都是贪官污吏，都是地主阶级专政的工具，这是其根本方面。所以我建议，给包拯、海瑞为代表的这批封建官僚摘掉“清官”的帽子，并在马克思主义的历史科学中取消“清官”的概念。但是，对他们又不能完全一律看待，这是另外一个问题，即如何评价历史人物的问题。如我们肯定岳飞是英雄，并不因为他是“清官”，而是因为他反抗了落后民族金人的侵入，曾对历史起过推动作用。对于海瑞也是一样，他修吴淞江，对当时应天府一带的生产发展起了一定的作用，但他不是“清官”。
    在历史上从来没有任何一个阶级，比无产阶级更尊重历史，也没有任何一个阶级，能象无产阶级一样，给历史和历史人物以科学的总结和评价。我们决不否认历史是由人来创造的，也不否认个别人物在历史上曾起过一定的作用。我们要遵循毛主席的教导，“从孔夫子到孙中山”给他们以批判的总结，才能
  “承继这一份珍贵的遗产”，才能“指导当前的伟大的运动”。这就要求我们在批判时必须具有无产阶级的立场、观点和方法，又必须和当前的伟大斗争结合起来；而决不能象“清官论”者一样，无中生有的创造一个标准，或者以封建阶级和资产阶级评价封建官僚的标准，把海瑞之流拉出来，赞美歌颂一番。这不是批判继承，这是旧东西的复活。因之，我们必须给“清官论”以严肃的批判。
