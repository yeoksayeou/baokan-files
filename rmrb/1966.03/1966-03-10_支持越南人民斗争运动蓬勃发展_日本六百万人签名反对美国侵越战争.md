    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 9th. The signature campaign "Oppose US Aggression Against Vietnam, Demand Comprehensive Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons" initiated by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is flourishing across Japan. From March 1st of last year to March 1st of this year, more than six million signatures have been collected.
    An official from the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs said that the broad masses of the Japanese people have enthusiastically responded to this movement. In particular, since US imperialism expanded its war of aggression against Vietnam, the number of signatures opposing US aggression against Vietnam has been increasing daily. People who have signed generally believe that one should not oppose war in general, but rather oppose the US war of aggression. Only in this way can peace be truly defended.
    This signature campaign has further raised the political consciousness of people from all walks of life in Japan. In a factory in Kanagawa Prefecture that produces electrical equipment, a group of young workers expressed great dissatisfaction with the factory's forcing them to work overtime day and night to complete the "special procurement" orders for the US military for its aggression against Vietnam. Recognizing that they should support the Vietnamese people's anti-US struggle for national salvation, they signed their names to oppose US aggression against Vietnam and even organized their own trade union. When the Japan Religious Peace Council carried out a signature campaign in Kishine, Yokohama City, it was unreasonably interfered with and obstructed by the US military authorities and the Japanese police. However, the manager of a private car park took the initiative to lend the car park to the marching masses, enabling the marching队伍to successfully hold a rally in front of the US military field hospital to oppose US aggression against Vietnam, and collected many signatures.
    At present, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is striving to collect a total of ten million signatures before the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is held in August this year.

### 支持越南人民斗争运动蓬勃发展  日本六百万人签名反对美国侵越战争

    支持越南人民斗争运动蓬勃发展
    日本六百万人签名反对美国侵越战争
    新华社东京九日电  由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会发起的“反对美国侵略越南、要求全面禁止核武器”的签名运动，在日本全国各地蓬勃展开，从去年三月一日到今年三月一日为止，共征集了六百多万人签名。
    日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的一位负责人说，日本广大人民热烈响应这一运动，特别是在美帝国主义扩大对越南的侵略战争以后，签名反对美国侵略越南的日益增多。参加签名的人普遍地认为，不应当笼统地反对战争，而是应当反对美国的侵略战争，只有这样才能真正保卫住和平。
    这项征集签名运动使日本各阶层人民进一步提高了政治觉悟。神奈川县一家生产电气器材的工厂有一批青年工人对于厂方强迫他们日夜加班加点来完成美军为侵略越南的“特需”订货表示非常不满，并认识到自己应当支援越南人民的反美救国斗争，于是他们签名表示反对美国侵略越南，而且还组织了自己的工会。日本宗教家和平协议会在横滨市岸根开展签名运动时，遭到美军当局和日本警察的无理干涉和阻挠。但是有一家私营汽车停车场的管理人员主动把停车场借给参加游行的群众，使得游行队伍在美军野战医院门前成功地举行了反对美国侵略越南的集会，而且征集了很多人签名。
    目前，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会正在为争取在今年八月举行第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会以前总共征集一千万人签名而奋斗。
