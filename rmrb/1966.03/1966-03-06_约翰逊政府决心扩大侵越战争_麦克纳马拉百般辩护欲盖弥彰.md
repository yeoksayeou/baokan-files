    Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara had just made a statement at a press conference on the 2nd regarding the U.S. government's situation in the war of aggression against Vietnam. On the 3rd, he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the same issue, offering sophistry for the government's policy of aggression against Vietnam, and indicating that the U.S. government is determined to act recklessly, even at the risk of war with China.
    Leading U.S. government officials, including President Johnson himself, have recently made a series of lengthy public and private speeches on the policy of aggression against Vietnam, tirelessly defending the policy. They are doing this, on the one hand, to try to appease the domestic unrest caused by the deepening quagmire in Vietnam and quell the growing domestic criticism of the policy of aggression against Vietnam. On the other hand, they are making every effort to prepare psychologically and in terms of public opinion for further expansion of the adventure in Vietnam. In his speech on the 3rd, McNamara summarized domestic criticisms of the Vietnam policy into ten major questions. These questions include: the nature of the war in South Vietnam, how long it will continue, how many U.S. troops will be needed, whether the U.S. faces the prospect of a ground war in Asia, whether it faces the danger of war with China, and whether the U.S. has the material and human resources to sustain it, and so on. His speech shows that the more the U.S. authorities try to cover up their wolfish ambition to expand the adventure in Vietnam, the more it shows that the U.S. is carefully plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The U.S. Secretary of Defense attempted to shirk the U.S.'s responsibility for its crimes of aggression. He said that the idea that the war in South Vietnam is a “domestic affair” and that the U.S. should not be involved is “totally unfounded.” He babbled that “Hanoi is implementing a large-scale plan to increase infiltration (into South Vietnam),” and that North Vietnam has carried out “direct and blatant aggression against a treaty ally, South Vietnam.”
    However, McNamara’s lies cannot even deceive U.S. congressmen. Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said afterward that he disagreed with McNamara's claim that North Vietnam "crossed the border to carry out aggression."
    When McNamara spoke of how long the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam would last and how many more troops the U.S. would need to send, he said, "I would very much like to give a specific answer as to how long the war will last. But answers about years and months are useless." He said that the U.S. must continuously increase its troops to strengthen "our ability to persuade the enemy"; if the Vietnamese people do not submit, the U.S. "has no other choice but to continue to strengthen its efforts in South Vietnam to destroy" the South Vietnamese people's armed forces.
    This U.S. Secretary of Defense did not further elaborate on how many more troops the U.S. would send to South Vietnam. But he said that "in 1966, it will be necessary for South Vietnamese troops, U.S. troops, and troops from other countries of the free world to increase their strength to deal with the enemy's troop increase operations." He pointed out that the supplemental appropriations for the 1966 fiscal year and the defense budget for the 1967 fiscal year will enable more U.S. military personnel to "provide support and deploy in South Vietnam as necessary" by the end of the year. He used the growth and strengthening of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces as an excuse for the U.S. to increase troops, and promoted the idea that the U.S. should adopt "a basic strategy that is one step ahead of the enemy's expected troop increases" in South Vietnam.
    In his speech, McNamara repeatedly talked about the U.S. only pursuing "limited goals" in Vietnam, that the U.S. "will not unduly risk escalating this war in Southeast Asia," and that the U.S. must maintain the "limited nature of the war," and so on. But he said that the essence of the U.S. policy "is to protect South Vietnam from attack, from the kind of aggression supported, directed and guided by North Vietnam." This revealed that the U.S. is determined to insist on dividing and occupying South Vietnam at all costs.
    He went on to further state that in order to achieve the goal of occupying South Vietnam, the U.S. would not hesitate to risk expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam to China. When talking about whether the U.S. faces the risk of fighting China, he, on the one hand, asserted that the foundation of U.S. policy is "not to take any action against China," and on the other hand, recklessly threatened that "it would be irresponsible if I said that our efforts to defend South Vietnam from aggression would not put us at risk of fighting China." He said that this danger "arises from our treaty obligations." In order to find excuses for the U.S.'s policy of aggression, McNamara once again slandered and attacked China as an "aggressive" country. He said that the bilateral treaties that the U.S. signed with Japan, the Park Chung-hee Group, and the Chiang Kai-shek Group, as well as the obligations the U.S. has undertaken under the Southeast Asia Treaty and the ANZUS Treaty, all have the effect of making the U.S. "bear the risk of fighting China."

### 约翰逊政府决心扩大侵越战争  麦克纳马拉百般辩护欲盖弥彰

    约翰逊政府决心扩大侵越战争
    麦克纳马拉百般辩护欲盖弥彰
    新华社四日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉二日刚刚在记者招待会上就美国政府侵越战争的处境发表了声明，三日又在参议院外交委员会就同一问题作证，为政府侵越政策进行狡辩，并且表示美国政府决心蛮干到底，甚至不惜冒同中国交战的危险。
    包括总统约翰逊本人在内的美国政府大员，最近接二连三地就侵越政策发表公开和秘密的长篇讲话，唇焦舌敝地为侵越政策辩护。他们这样作，一方面是企图安抚因为在侵越泥潭中越陷越深而在国内引起的人心动荡，平息国内日益强烈的对侵越政策的批评；另一方面，又竭力为进一步扩大侵越冒险作心理上和舆论上的准备。麦克纳马拉在三日的讲话中，把美国国内对侵越政策的批评归纳为十大问题。这些问题包括：南越战争的性质、要继续打多久、需要多少美国军队、美国是否面临在亚洲进行地面大战的前景、是否面临同中国交战的危险以及美国的物力和人力是否能够支持得了等等。他的讲话表明，美国当局越是掩饰美国扩大侵越冒险的狼子野心，越说明美国正在处心积虑扩大侵越战争。
    美国国防部长妄图推卸美国的侵略罪责。他说什么关于认为南越战争是“内政”，美国不应当卷入的“这种结论是完全没有根据的”。他胡说“河内执行一个大规模计划来增加（对南越）渗入”，越南北方“对一个条约盟国南越进行了直接的和露骨的侵略”。
    可是，麦克纳马拉的这些谎言连美国议员都骗不了。参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特事后说，他不同意麦克纳马拉关于越南北方“越过边界进行侵略”的说法。
    麦克纳马拉在谈到美国侵越战争要持续多久、美国还需要增派多少军队等问题时说，“对于战争打多久，我很想作出具体的回答。但是关于几年几月的回答都是没有用的”。他说，美国要不断增加兵力以加强“我们说服敌人的能力”；如果越南人民不屈服，美国“没有别的办法而只有继续加强在南越的努力来摧毁”南越人民武装力量。
    这个美国国防部长没有进一步说明美国在南越还要增加多少部队。但是他说，“在一九六六年，南越部队、美军和自由世界的其他国家的部队，将有必要增加力量来对付敌人增加兵力的行动”。他指出，一九六六财政年度的追加拨款和一九六七财政年度的国防预算，将使更多的美国军事人员到年底以前“在必要时可以在南越提供支持和进行部署”。他以南越人民武装发展壮大作为美国增兵的借口，并且鼓吹美国在南越要采取“比预料敌军的增兵领先一步的基本战略”。
    麦克纳马拉在发言里三番五次地大谈美国在越南只追求
  “有限的目标”，美国“不会不适当地冒使这场东南亚的战争逐步升级的风险”，美国要保持“战争的有限性质”等等。但是他说，美国的政策的实质“是要保护南越不受攻击，不受在北越支持、指挥和指导下的那种侵略。”这就一言道破了，美国决心不顾一切，坚持要分割和霸占南越。
    他接着进一步表明，美国为了达到霸占南越的目的，不惜冒把侵越战争扩大到中国的危险。他在谈到美国是否面临同中国作战的风险时，一面扬言美国政策的基础是“不对中国采取任何行动”，一面放肆地威胁说：“如果我说我们为保卫南越不受侵略而作出的努力不会使我们冒同中国交战的危险，那是不负责任的”，他说什么这种危险“是我们条约义务产生的”。为了给美国的侵略政策找借口，麦克纳马拉又一次污蔑和攻击中国是一个“侵略”国家。他说，美国同日本、朴正熙集团、蒋介石集团订立的双边条约以及美国根据东南亚条约和美澳新条约承担的义务，都有使美国“承担同中国交战的危险”。（附图片）
