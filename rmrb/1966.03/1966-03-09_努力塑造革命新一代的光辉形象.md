Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." Today, cultivating successors to the revolution is an event of great strategic significance. Using literary and artistic forms to shape the glorious images of various advanced young people of our time, to portray their vigorous spirit, to express their active creative power, and to set examples for the vast number of young people of the same era to learn from, is an important task of our literary and artistic creation. The four mass commentary articles published in this newspaper today are all commentaries on works with the theme of cultivating revolutionary successors.
    Strive to Shape the Glorious Image of a New Generation of Revolutionaries
    Wuhan  Peng Lixun
    Under the Party's kind care and the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought, in the struggle of the three great revolutionary movements, China's new generation of revolutionaries is growing rapidly and healthily, and new people of the Lei Feng and Wang Jie type are constantly emerging. Cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is a great strategic task of our Party, and a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary cause can be passed on from generation to generation. We are pleased that in recent years, more and more short stories by amateur authors have appeared that express the theme of cultivating revolutionary successors. Such as "High Mountains and峻岭" [Junling], "Sunken Ship Reef," and "Lead Time" which reflect military life; "Target," "Line Patroller," and "Dragon Soaring and Tiger Leaping" which reflect industrial themes, and "High on the Mountain" and "March Qingming" which reflect rural life, etc., all touch upon the issue of cultivating revolutionary successors to varying degrees, and respectively shape a group of images of the new generation of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Hong Jiagen, the young radar soldier in the novel "High Mountains and峻岭" [Junling], Shi Zhuzi, the young pilot in "Lead Time," and Yang Tingshan, the young deputy captain in "Sunken Ship Reef," can all consciously use high revolutionary standards to strictly demand themselves in daily military training, and carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary heroism of our army. In order to enter "first-class combat readiness" more quickly, Hong Jiagen "is not afraid of sweating, falling, or bleeding," and works hard to climb the "Wolongtuo, which even mountain goats dare not touch a 'hair'"; in order to become a "living warehouse" needed in wartime, he tirelessly travels back and forth on the mountain day and night, holding an enamel cup full of water. Under the guidance of Squadron Leader Lu Ping, Shi Zhuzi discovered that he lacked a "lead time" in his mind, and immediately launched a tenacious struggle against his shortcomings. He felt that he was not yet up to the high standards of a successor, so he "returned to the furnace for retraining," and as a result, he not only refined a new combat plan, but also refined new ideas, "with a 'lead time' installed in his mind, and his own footprints in the sky." The tenacious fighting spirit and endless revolutionary energy of these young soldiers and commanders in the face of difficulties are the result of arming their minds with the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution; it is the result of their clear awareness of the revolutionary responsibility of their generation, constantly remembering that two-thirds of the people in the world are waiting for liberation, and having lofty revolutionary ideals; it is the result of their clear understanding of the nature of imperialism, constantly preparing to deal with the most serious incidents, and closely linking everything with "fighting." These are the ideological driving forces behind their heroic will and behavior in daily training, and also the concentrated embodiment of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in their character.
    Many novels depicting industrial themes show us the path of rapid growth of the new generation of the working class under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought. Many of them already have relatively mature thinking, such as Lin An'ying, the young driver in "Target" who clarified the "grand goal" of the revolution and excellently completed the revolutionary task of driving; some are gradually maturing with the help of the older generation of revolutionary workers, such as Zhou Xiaohu, the female apprentice in "Dragon Soaring and Tiger Leaping" who took on the heavy responsibility of motor production, and "I" in "Line Patroller" who constantly learned from the old master "Fire God" and improved his ideological awareness, and so on. Although these people have different degrees of maturity, they all have a revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, and a revolutionary enthusiasm for learning and making progress. With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, they have created many amazing miracles. In places where foreign capitalists have failed, our young generation of workers has achieved victory; things that foreign capitalists could not do have become a reality in the hands of our young generation of workers. The heroic feats of the working class descendants are vivid manifestations of the political power of Mao Zedong Thought.
    In the novels reflecting rural life, there are many images of the new generation in the countryside, which are written in a simple and moving way. "March Qingming" depicts the image of Lian Qing, a new generation of farmer who is both cultured and loves agricultural labor, a brand-new revolutionary farmer armed with Mao Zedong Thought. "High on the Mountain" writes about Liu Zhihong, a young revolutionary pioneer in a mountainous area, who dares to move forward and dares to win in the struggle with nature, showing the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai people in changing the world. He led the masses to control floods and transform river beaches with the spirit of Yugong removing mountains. In transforming the objective world, he also transformed his subjective world. Under the guidance of the old branch secretary, he learned to consider issues comprehensively and to combine revolutionary courage with scientific analysis. At the most critical moment and in the most critical place, he dared to take on heavy responsibilities, fully demonstrating the revolutionary courage of the heroic younger generation.
    These socialist builders who are active on different fronts, although they have different personalities, they have a striking common feature, that is, they are all revolutionary new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Through the development of the characters of many of them, the authors express the process of continuous revolutionization of China's new generation under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought; through the revelation of the essence of their characters, they show the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in their characters, reflecting the revolutionary spirit of China's new generation. In the images of these revolutionary successors, Mao Zedong Thought is not something added externally, not a label pasted on a person's face, but "something very internal, nerve-brain-marrow" (Gorky's words). It permeates the characters' thoughts and is organically integrated with the characters' living personalities. It is the core of the entire character and the pillar of the entire spiritual outlook of the character. Because of this, these advanced figures of the younger generation can give people a relatively strong infection with their high revolutionary spirit, progressive revolutionary character, and vigorous revolutionary vitality.
    These novels shape the image of the new generation of revolutionaries, not in isolation by writing about their heroic deeds, but by placing them under the leadership of the Party and the mass base, especially by placing them in their relationship with the older generation of revolutionaries, which further highlights the revolutionary significance of the growth of a new generation of character and deepens the theme of cultivating revolutionary successors in such works. In works such as "High Mountains and峻岭" [Junling], "Sunken Ship Reef," "Dragon Soaring and Tiger Leaping," and "High on the Mountain," we have seen successful depictions of the images of the older generation of revolutionaries in all aspects of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The authors mostly portray the older generation of revolutionaries' broad political vision and high sense of revolutionary responsibility from the perspective of cultivating revolutionary successors. They not only understand the importance and urgency of cultivating successors from the height of whether the revolutionary cause will have successors, but also understand how to lead the team well and how to use correct methods to promote the faster growth of successors. For example, Zhang Jian, the director of the political department of the regiment in "High Mountains and峻岭" [Junling], is an excellent image of a leader of the team in the army. He is like "the high radar antenna," standing high, seeing far, with a broad mind and sharp eyes. He saw the new situation of the vigorous development of the revolutionary cause, and also deeply understood that the new generation like Hong Jiagen has a great revolutionary spirit of enterprise. Therefore, he was able to break the routine and boldly and actively cultivate revolutionary successors. He discovered Hong Jiagen, a good mineral seedling, in a timely manner, and was able to guide him to grow correctly and rapidly by guiding him in a timely manner. On the one hand, he warmly encouraged Hong Jiagen's revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive, and at the same time guided him to learn to consider issues in a down-to-earth and comprehensive way. Every step of Hong Jiagen's character growth is a crystallization of the hard work of Zhang Jian, the older generation of revolutionaries. In addition, Yan Ming, the captain in "Sunken Ship Reef," Cao Jinlong, the "Magic Knife" master in "Dragon Soaring and Tiger Leaping," and Yu Chenghe, the branch secretary in "High on the Mountain," are all heroic images of leaders of successful teams. In these works, the most fundamental thing that the revolutionary predecessors hand over to the revolutionary new generation is Mao Zedong Thought. These excellent images of leaders of the team, they are both learners and embodiments of Mao Zedong Thought, and propagators and sowers of Mao Zedong Thought. They always use Mao Zedong Thought to demand the revolutionary new generation so warmly and strictly, affirming the places in them that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and pointing out in which aspects they need to further study Mao Zedong Thought. What does Captain Yan Ming use to demand Yang Tingshan? This is not just the "teaching requirement." From this point of view, Yang Tingshan is already qualified. What he requires of Yang Tingshan is the spirit of continuous revolution: "Although you can't hear the sound of guns now, and you can't see the smoke of gunpowder, the war is 'like this storm, it comes when it comes, and all work must be done ahead of time..." This is Yan Ming's guiding ideology for making strict demands on Yang Tingshan, and it is also the thought he requires Yang Tingshan to grasp. Isn't this Mao Zedong Thought? Others, such as Cao Jinlong using Chairman Mao's expectations for young people to encourage Xiaohu, using the heavy responsibility of the world proletarian revolution to inspire Xiaohu; Xianman Uncle using the idea of "farming to be constantly revolutionary" to influence Lian Qing; Yu Chenghe educating Liu Zhihong to combine revolutionary courage with scientific analysis, all reflect the characteristics of handing over Mao Zedong Thought first.
    The heroic images of the two generations in these works play a mutually complementary role. On the one hand, the older generation of revolutionaries boldly let go to cultivate successors, and dared to promote outstanding talents among them to key responsible positions; on the other hand, the revolutionary new generation also dared to take on heavy responsibilities, and did a good job of it. On the one hand, the older generation of revolutionaries demanded successors strictly; on the other hand, the revolutionary new generation could also consciously demand themselves with high standards. The older generation of revolutionaries enthusiastically sowed Mao Zedong Thought, and the new generation of revolutionaries worked hard to let Mao Zedong Thought take root and blossom in their hearts. This profoundly shows that revolutionary successors are taking over the revolutionary relay baton from their predecessors, and are moving forward with heroic spirit and courage, and the proletarian revolutionary cause is developing and growing.
    As mentioned above, the achievements of young amateur authors' novels in shaping the heroic image of the new generation of revolutionaries are multifaceted. However, it must also be seen that, in terms of shaping the glorious image of China's new generation of revolutionaries, our literary and artistic creation cannot fully meet the requirements of the vast number of young people. We hope that some more generalized, more ideal, and fuller typical images of China's revolutionary youth generation can continue to appear in literary and artistic works, so as to further promote the revolutionization of the vast number of young people.

### 努力塑造革命新一代的光辉形象

专栏：

    编者按：毛泽东同志说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”在今天，培养革命接班人，更是富有战略意义的大事。运用文艺的形式，塑造当代各类先进青年的光辉形象，把他们生气蓬勃的精神面貌刻划出来，把他们积极的创造力量表现出来，为同时代的广大青年树立学习的榜样，这是我们文艺创作的一个重要任务。今天本报发表的四篇群众的评论文章，评论的都是以培养革命接班人为主题的作品。
    努力塑造革命新一代的光辉形象
    武汉  彭立勋
    在党的亲切关怀和毛泽东思想的哺育下，在三大革命运动的斗争里，我国革命的新一代正在迅速、健壮地成长，雷锋、王杰式的一代新人不断涌现。培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是我们党的一项伟大的战略任务，是关系到革命事业能不能一代代的传下去的重大问题。值得我们高兴的是，近年来出现的业余作者的短篇小说中，表现培养革命接班人主题的越来越多了。如反映部队生活的《高山峻岭》、《沉船礁》、《提前量》；反映工业题材的《目标》、《巡线工》、《龙腾虎跃》和反映农村生活的《高高的山上》、《三月清明》等等，都在不同程度上接触到培养革命接班人的问题，分别塑造了一批工农兵革命新一代的形象。
    小说《高山峻岭》中的青年雷达兵洪家根，《提前量》中的青年飞行员石柱子，《沉船礁》中的青年副舰长杨亭山等，他们都能在日常的军事训练中，自觉地用革命的高标准严格要求自己，发扬了我军革命英雄主义的光荣传统。洪家根为了更迅速地进入“一等战备”，“不怕淌汗、摔跤、流血”，苦练攀登“山羊都不敢上去动一根‘毫毛’的卧虎腿”；为了练成一个战时需要的“活仓库”，不分日夜地端着一只盛满水的搪瓷杯，山上山下来回折腾。石柱子在中队长路平诱导下，发现自己脑子里缺少一个“提前量”，就立刻向自己的缺点展开顽强的斗争。他自己觉得还不合乎接班人的高标准，于是“回炉重炼”，结果不仅炼出了新的战斗方案，也炼出了新思想，“脑子里装了个‘提前量’，天空中有了自己的脚印”。这些年轻的战士和指挥员迎难而上的顽强斗志，无穷无尽的革命精力，是用不断革命、彻底革命精神武装头脑的结果；是他们明确意识到自己这一代的革命责任，时刻记住世界上还有三分之二的人民期待着解放，心怀远大革命理想的结果；是他们清醒认识到帝国主义的本性，时刻准备应付最严重的事变，把一切都跟“打”紧紧连接在一起的结果。这些就是他们在日常训练中英雄意志和行为的思想原动力，也是他们性格中毛泽东思想光辉的集中体现。
    描写工业题材的许多小说，向我们展示了工人阶级的新一代在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长的道路。他们之中有许多人思想已经比较成熟了，如《目标》中明确了革命的“大目标”，出色完成开车革命任务的青年司机林岸英等；也有的正在老一代革命工人的帮助下，逐渐走向成熟，如《龙腾虎跃》中担任了电机生产重担的女徒弟周小虎，《巡线工》中不断向老师傅“火神爷”学习，提高了思想觉悟的“我”，等等。尽管这些人的成熟程度各有不同，但他们都有一股敢想敢干的革命闯劲和好学向上的革命热情。他们以自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，创造了许多惊人的奇迹。在外国资本家曾经失败的地方，我们年轻的工人一代却取得了胜利；外国资本家无法做到的事，在我们年轻的工人一代手中却变成了现实。工人后代的雄心壮举，都是毛泽东思想政治威力的生动体现。
    反映农村生活的小说中，有许多农村一代新人的形象，写得既朴实而又动人。《三月清明》描写了一个既有文化，又热爱农业劳动的新一代农民连清的形象，这是一个被毛泽东思想所武装的崭新的革命种田人。《高高的山上》写了一个山区的青年革命闯将刘志红，他在和大自然斗争中，敢于前进，敢于胜利，显示了大寨人改天换地的那种革命气概。他用愚公移山精神带领群众制服洪水，改造河滩。在改造客观世界中，也改造了自己的主观世界。在老支书的教导下，他学会了全面考虑问题，学会了把革命的胆略与科学的分析结合起来。在最关键的时刻，最关键的地方，他敢于挑重担，充分显示了英雄的年轻一代的革命胆识。
    这些活跃在不同战线的社会主义建设者们，虽然个性各有不同，但他们却有一个引人注目的共同特点，这就是他们都是被毛泽东思想所武装的革命新人。作者们通过他们之中许多人性格的发展，表现了我国革命新一代在毛泽东思想哺育下不断革命化的过程；通过对他们性格本质的揭示，显示了他们性格之中的毛泽东思想的光辉，反映了我国革命新一代的革命精神面貌。在这些革命接班人的形象中，毛泽东思想不是外加进去的，不是贴在一个人脸上的标签，而是“一种非常内部的、神经——脑髓的”东西（高尔基语）。它渗透到人物思想里，和人物活生生的性格有机地融为一体。它是整个人物性格的核心，是人物整个精神面貌的支柱。正因为如此，这些青年一代的先进人物，才能以昂扬的革命精神、进取的革命性格、蓬勃的革命活力，给人以比较强烈的感染。
    这些小说塑造革命新一代的形象，不是孤立地写他们的英雄事迹，而是把他们放在党的领导下和群众基础上来描写，特别是放在他们同老一代革命者的关系中来描写，这就更加突出了一代新人性格成长的革命意义，深化了这类作品培养革命接班人的主题。在《高山峻岭》、《沉船礁》、《龙腾虎跃》、《高高的山上》等作品中，我们看到了对于工农兵各个方面老一代革命者形象的成功描写。作者们大都从培养革命接班人这个角度，刻划了这些老一代革命者的远大的政治眼光和高度的革命责任感。他们不仅都能从革命事业是否后继有人的高度认识培养接班人的重要性、迫切性，而且也懂得怎样才能带好班，怎样用正确的方法促使接班人更快地成长。如《高山峻岭》中的团政治处主任章健，就是一个优秀的部队带班人的形象。他象“那高高矗立的雷达天线”，立得高，看得远，心胸辽阔，眼光锐利，他看到了革命事业蓬勃发展的新形势，也深深了解象洪家根这样的新一代具有着极大的革命进取心，因此，他能够打破常规，大胆地、积极地培养革命接班人。他及时地发现了洪家根这个好矿苗，又能因势利导地诱导他正确地、迅速地成长，一方面对洪家根的革命热情和革命干劲加以热情的鼓励，同时又指导他学会扎扎实实、全面考虑问题。洪家根性格的每一步成长，都凝聚着章健这个老一代革命者的心血的结晶。此外，象《沉船礁》中的大队长严明，《龙腾虎跃》中的“神刀”师傅曹金龙，
  《高高的山上》中的支部书记余诚和等，也都是写得成功的带班人的英雄形象。在这些作品中，革命的前辈向革命新一代交班，所交的最根本的东西就是毛泽东思想。这些优秀的带班人形象，他们既是毛泽东思想的学习者，体现者，又是毛泽东思想的宣传者，播种者。他们总是那样热诚而又严格地用毛泽东思想去要求革命的新一代，既肯定他们身上符合毛泽东思想的地方，予以发扬，又指出他们在那些方面还需要进一步学习毛泽东思想。大队长严明用什么来要求杨亭山呢？这不止是那个“教范要求”。从这一点上说，杨亭山已经合格了。他所要求于杨亭山的是不断革命的精神：“现在虽然听不到炮声，看不见硝烟，但战争‘就象这暴风雨，说来就来，一切工作都要抢在前头……”这是严明对杨亭山提出严格要求的指导思想，也是他要求杨亭山掌握的思想。这不正是毛泽东思想吗？其他如曹金龙用毛主席对青年的期望鼓舞小虎，用无产阶级世界革命的重任激励小虎；显满叔用“种田要不断革命”的思想影响连清；余诚和教育刘志红把革命胆略与科学分析结合起来，也无不体现了交班首先交毛泽东思想的特点。
    这些作品中所塑造的两代人的英雄形象，互相起到了交相辉映的作用。一方面，老一代革命者大胆放手地培养接班人，敢于提拔他们中的优秀人材到关键性的负责岗位上来；另一方面，革命新一代也敢于挑重担，而且挑得很好。一方面，革命老一代从难从严要求接班人；另一方面，革命新一代也能自觉地用高标准要求自己。老一代革命者热心播种毛泽东思想，新一代革命者则努力让毛泽东思想在自己心里生根、开花。这就深刻地显示了：革命接班人从前辈手中接过革命的接力棒，正在英姿奋发、勇往直前，无产阶级革命事业正在发展、壮大。
    如上所述，青年业余作者的小说在塑造革命新一代的英雄形象方面的成就是多方面的。但是也要看到，就塑造我国革命新一代的光辉形象这个问题来说，我们的文艺创作也还不能充分满足广大青年要求。我们希望文艺作品中能够不断出现一些概括性更高、更理想、更丰满的我国革命青年一代的典型形象，通过它们以进一步推动广大青年的革命化。
