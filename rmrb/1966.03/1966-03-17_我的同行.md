    My Fellow Worker
    Xu Huaijin, Shanghai Medical Instrument Factory
    After finishing the first batch of hemostat blanks, I stopped swinging the hammer, took off the towel around my neck, and wiped the sweat from my face. At that moment, someone patted my shoulder. I turned around and saw it was Foreman Wan, with a stranger standing beside him. Foreman Wan pointed to the man with one hand and cupped the other into a megaphone, holding it to his mouth, and said loudly to me, "This is Master Xiong Kuohai from the Suzhou Zaofu Medical Instrument Factory. He came all the way from Suzhou specifically to 'learn from you'..." The rest of his words were drowned out by the clanging of hammers and the roaring of the blowers.
    This Master Xiong rushed forward, grasped my hand, and said warmly, "Old Li, I've come to learn from you, hoping to be taken on as a student. I don't know if you're willing to accept me?"
    I turned off the blower and said straightforwardly, "I'm not that skilled. But if you have any difficulties, and I, Li Tianxi, can help, I definitely won't let you go back empty-handed!"
    Old Xiong laughed heartily, "Worthy of being a fellow blacksmith! Okay, I'll be frank. I heard you improved a hot rolling mill using scrap materials, turning the forging of hemostats and surgical scissors from manual operation to mechanization. Today, I'm here specifically to learn about this."
    "This, this..." I was taken aback. This was something I was inspired to do a few months ago when I visited the Shanghai Industrial Production Exhibition. I wanted to get rid of the sledgehammer and realize my long-cherished wish. But the machine wasn't even successfully improved yet, and the news has already spread from Shanghai to Suzhou! I couldn't help but be surprised and asked,
    "How did you know about this?"
    "Well, it's a long story. The state needs us to produce two million hemostats and health scissors, but last year we only produced two hundred thousand. The gap is too big. The state was afraid we couldn't handle the burden and wouldn't meet the target, so they wanted to cut it in half. Can we allow that? If we, the working class, don't shoulder the heavy burden of the state, who will!
    "But the key problem lies in the first process, which is our forging work. If we continue to process in the old way, even working twenty-four hours a day, we probably won't even reach half the target. What to do? Dozens of people came up with a solution: liberate ourselves from the hammer!
    "Some time ago, a group of people from our factory came to your factory's fitter workshop to learn operational experience. After returning, they said you were improving a hot rolling mill. Today, it happens to be the factory holiday, so here I am."
    "Don't laugh at me, it's true I'm improving a machine, but I'm stuck on an obstacle that's been there for a long time. If you want to see it, I'll take you to have a look. However, we blacksmiths doing machines are like blind men climbing mountains, feeling our way one step at a time. I hope you can help me."
    "Look at you, we're all one family, no need to speak like outsiders." After he said that, we both laughed.
    I led my fellow worker into a small room in the locker room, opened the window, and pointed to a pile of parts at the foot of the wall, saying, "There, that's the hot rolling mill you want to see." He immediately stopped smiling and slowly squatted down, like an inspector, moving each piece, carefully examining them. At this time, I took out a draft I designed earlier from the drawer of the toolbox. He took it and was so excited that he stomped his feet and praised it repeatedly. With my permission, he took out a pen and copied the draft into his notebook.
    The lunch bell rang, and I invited him to eat in the cafeteria together, but he refused, saying, "I brought my own lunch." He took out three steamed buns from his pocket, "See, it's convenient and doesn't waste time."
    After I finished eating, I brought him a bowl of shredded pork and egg soup. He said, "Oh dear, I told you not to bother, but look, you're still going to all this trouble!"
    Until the sun set in the west, my fellow worker shook my hand to say goodbye and asked me, "Old Li, how long has it been stuck?" I said, "It's been stuck for about two months." He said earnestly, "You always understand the temper of us blacksmiths. Don't blame me for criticizing you, but for such a major technological innovation task, you want to lock yourself in a room and work alone. The spirit is good, but you must know how to use all favorable conditions and concentrate the wisdom of the people. Any difficulty, no matter how great, can be conquered. We must be responsible to the socialist cause when we engage in technological innovation!"
    To be honest, I felt a bit uncomfortable when I heard his words at the time!
    Two months later, one day, the factory director accompanied a visiting reporting team to our workshop. The leader had already posted a big red good news poster on the bulletin board and read aloud, "...With the help of Comrade Li Tianxi of your factory, the hot rolling mill has been successfully improved, increasing efficiency by thirty-two times..." I immediately understood what was going on. I never thought he would make the hot rolling mill so quickly.
    With the support of the factory leaders, the next day we divided into two groups: one group went to the Suzhou Zaofu Factory to retrieve the successful experience; the other group followed me to the workshop to formulate a plan to capture the "obstacle", determined to catch up. While we were studying, someone suddenly said that there was a big man outside who wanted to see me. I went out and saw, ah! It was him, my fellow worker, Xiong Kuohai. He gripped my hand and asked with concern, "How is the hot rolling mill doing?" I shook my head in shame. He asked again, "What problem are you stuck on?"
    "Still the heating problem," I said.
    "This problem also gave us a hard time!" he said, "Last night, I heard from the comrades who came back with the good news that you were stuck on a problem, so I came as soon as I finished the night shift today."
    I said apologetically, "Kuohai, thank you for thinking of our affairs."
    Before I could finish speaking, he said loudly, "Hey, we're all one family, no need to speak like outsiders!" After saying that, he rolled up his sleeves and walked into the workshop with me... (Attached picture)

    我的同行
    上海医疗器械厂　徐怀金
    打完第一批血管钳毛坯，我收住大锤，摘下围在脖子上的毛巾，揩去一脸的汗。这时，我的肩胛被人拍了一下，转身一看，原来是万工长，他的身旁站着一个陌生人。万工长一手指着那人，一手圈成个喇叭筒，套在嘴边，大声地对我说：“这位是苏州造福医疗器械厂的熊阔海熊师傅，人家是特地从苏州赶来向你‘取经’的……”下面的话被叮当的锤声，隆隆的鼓风机声的强大音流淹没了。
    这位熊师傅抢上一步握住我的手，热情地说：“老李啊，我是慕名而来，投师学艺的，不知道你肯收不？”
    我顺手关掉鼓风机，直率地说：“论技术，我不行，如果你有什么困难，我李天锡能帮得上忙，决不会叫你空着手回去的！”
    老熊爽声大笑起来：“不愧是铁匠的同行！好吧，我也就实说了：听说你利用废料改进了一台热轧机，使止血钳、手术剪的锻加工从手工操作变成机械化啦，今天我是特为这事来取经学习的。”
    “这，这……”我大吃一惊。这是在数月之前，参观上海工业生产展览会的时候，从一台土机床上受到的启发，想丢掉大榔头，实现多年来的宿愿。可是，机器还没有改进成功，消息竟从上海传到苏州了！我不能不感到惊奇，便反问道：
    “这件事你们怎么会知道的？”
    “说来话可长呢。国家需要我们生产出二百万把止血钳和保健剪，可是我们去年全年只不过生产了二十万把，这个差距太大了，国家怕我们负担太重，达不到指标，要减去一半。你说，这能行吗？国家的千斤重担，我们工人阶级不挑起来，叫谁去挑哇！
      “可是关键问题就在头道工序，也就是说在我们锻工身上了。如若仍照老方法加工，一天干上二十四小时，恐怕连指标的一半都达不到。怎么办呢？几十个人想出一个办法：从铁锤底下解放出来！
    “前些时候，恰巧厂里有一批人到你们厂钳工工场来学习操作经验。回来以后，说你正在改进一台热轧机。今天碰巧逢厂礼拜，这就来了。”
    “不怕你见笑，改进机器倒一点不假，可就是碰上一条‘拦路虎’搁着多时了，你要看我便带你去看看，不过，我们锻工搞机器就好比瞎子爬山，摸索一步攀登一步啊，还望你多帮助才是。”
    “你看你，咱们一家人何必说两家话。”说完我们两人都笑了起来。
    我领着我的同行走进更衣室里的一个套间，推开窗门，朝墙脚下的一堆零件一指说：“喏，这便是你要看的热轧机。”他立刻收敛起笑容，慢慢地蹲下身去，象一个检验员似的，挨个儿搬弄，认真地检阅。这时，我又从工具箱的抽屉里拿出一张早先设计的草图来，他接过去一看，竟兴奋得拍腿跺脚，赞不绝口。征得了我的同意，他抽出一支钢笔，仿着草图朝本本上画了起来。
    午饭铃响了，我邀他一起去食堂吃饭，他拒绝了，说：“我午饭随身带来了。”并从衣袋里掏出三个馒头来：“瞧，又方便，又不误时间。”
    我吃完饭，顺便带了一碗肉丝蛋汤给他，他说：“哎呀呀，我说不叫你多费事的，你看，还是叫你费事了！”
    直到太阳西沉，我的同行握住我的手与我道别的时候问我说：“老李啊，搁下来多少时间啦？”我说：“搁下来约有两个多月吧。”他认真地说：“咱们铁匠的脾气你总是了解的。莫怪我批评你，这么重大一项技术革新任务，你想一个人关在房间里单干，精神固然好，但是要懂得利用一切有利条件，集中众人的智慧，天大的困难都是能够征服的。我们搞技术革新要对社会主义事业负责呵！”
    说实话，对方的这一席话，当时我听了心里还有点不舒服呢！
    两个月以后，有一天，厂长陪着一个外来的报喜队来到我们工场。为首一人已将大红喜报高贴在壁报栏内，并高声朗读起来：“……在您厂李天锡同志的帮助下，热轧机改进成功了，提高工效三十二倍，……”我立刻明白过来是怎么回事了，我怎么也想不到他会这么快的制成了热轧机。
    在工厂领导的支持下，第二天我们就兵分两路：一路赴苏州造福厂去取回成功的经验；一路跟我下车间定计捉拿
  “拦路虎”，决心迎头赶上去。我们正在研究的当儿，忽然有人来说，外面有个大汉要见我。我出门一看，啊！是他，我的同行，熊阔海，他握紧我的手，关切地问：“热轧机怎样了？”我惭愧地摇了摇头。他又问：“被什么问题难住了？”
      “还是加热问题。”我说。
      “这个问题也曾把我们难得好苦哩！”他说：“昨天晚上听报喜的同志回来说，你们被难题卡住了，今天一做完夜班我就来了。”
    我歉疚地说：“阔海，谢谢你念着我们的事儿。”
    话没说完，他大声说：“嗨，一家人何必说两家话呢！”说罢，他捋起衣袖，同我一起走进了工场……。（附图片）
