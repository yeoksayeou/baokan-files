    Not only dare to do, but also know how to do
    Wang Xueli, Secretary of the Maowen Qiang Autonomous County Party Committee, Sichuan
    Since the liberation of Maowen, especially in recent years, we have done some work, set up some models, and achieved some results in improving soil, building water conservancy projects, afforestation, developing animal husbandry, and accumulating natural fertilizer. However, compared with Lankao County, we are far behind. Our investigation and planning are not as detailed as Lankao's, our determination is not as great as Lankao's, our actions are not as fast as Lankao's, and our results are not as good as Lankao's. The most fundamental reason is that we have not studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought as well as Lankao.
    After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's heroic deeds, we deeply realized that to serve the people completely and thoroughly, we must first solve the problem of worldview and establish lofty revolutionary ideals. Secondly, we must dare to do, and also know how to do. Revolution is a world-shaking struggle to break the old world and create a new world. It is impossible without a high degree of revolutionary spirit. But it is also impossible without a realistic attitude. Without daring to do, there is no way to acquire the ability to do well. Without knowing how to do, the purpose of daring to do cannot be achieved. Revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude are unified. In the future, we must strengthen investigation and research in our work, seriously treat the creations and experiences of the people, create good models, gain experience, and better carry out the three great revolutionary movements.

    既要敢干，还要会干
    四川茂汶羌族自治县县委书记　王学立
    茂汶解放以来，特别是近几年来，在改良土壤、兴修水利、造林、发展畜牧业和积造自然肥等方面，都做了一些工作，搞了一些样板，取得了一些成绩。但是，比起兰考县来，还差的很远，调查和规划没有兰考那样细致，决心没有兰考那样大，行动没有兰考那样快，效果没有兰考那样好，最根本的一条是活学活用毛泽东思想没有兰考那样好。
    学习了焦裕禄同志的英雄事迹，我们深深地认识到，要完全、彻底地为人民服务，首先要解决世界观问题，树立远大的革命理想。其次，敢干，还要会干。革命，是打破旧世界，创造新世界的翻天覆地的斗争，没有高度的革命精神是不行的。但缺乏实事求是的态度，也是不行的。不敢干就无从取得会干的本领，不会干，就达不到敢干的目的，革命精神和科学态度是统一的。今后，我们要在工作中加强调查研究，认真对待人民群众的创造和经验，搞好样板，取得经验，更好地进行三项伟大的革命运动。
