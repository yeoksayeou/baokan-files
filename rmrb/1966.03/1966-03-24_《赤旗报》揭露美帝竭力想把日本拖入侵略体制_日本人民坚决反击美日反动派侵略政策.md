    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 22nd: *Akahata* (Red Flag), the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article by Hiroshi Ota on March 22nd, pointing out that the Sato government's recent pronouncements about "dispatching troops abroad" and "defending Okinawa" expose the dangerous conspiracy of U.S.-Japan reactionaries who are eager to strengthen their aggressive and war-making system.

    The article reviewed the past discussions by U.S.-Japan reactionaries regarding the dispatch of Japanese troops overseas.

    The article stated that Sato government's clamoring in the Diet this March about "dispatching troops abroad" and "defending Okinawa" differs from past situations. Their true intention is to revise the current "Self-Defense Forces Law." Sato himself made numerous forceful statements in the Diet about "defending Okinawa," indicating that the Sato government intends to dispatch "Self-Defense Forces" to Okinawa under the pretext of "self-defense." This shows that the Japanese government's attitude toward the issue of "dispatching troops abroad" has taken several steps forward compared to the past. The article pointed out: Today, U.S. imperialism is deeply mired in the war of aggression in Vietnam, and it is increasingly seeking to mobilize Japanese manpower and material resources to participate in its aggressive and war-making system. Japanese monopoly capital is also eager to take advantage of the situation and grab a share, pulling chestnuts out of the fire for U.S. imperialism.

    The article concluded that the Sato government's raising of debates about "dispatching troops abroad" and "defending Okinawa" demonstrates that the war and reactionary policies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are deepening further, and they are being resolutely countered by the Japanese people.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on March 22nd: The "11th Central Labor Women's Congress," initiated by the New Japan Women's Association and over thirty other organizations, was held in Tokyo on the 21st and 22nd.

    The meeting passed a resolution opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and the visit of South Vietnamese puppet "Premier" Nguyen Cao Ky to Japan. The resolution expressed support for the Vietnamese women and people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation.

    The congress passed a resolution expressing its determination to fight for the overthrow of the Sato Cabinet, which is undermining the lives of the Japanese people. (Photo attached)

    On March 20th, over 200,000 people from all walks of life in Tokyo, Japan, rallied to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and overthrow the Sato Cabinet. The picture shows the marching masses participating in the rally on the streets of Tokyo.

    《赤旗报》揭露美帝竭力想把日本拖入侵略体制
    日本人民坚决反击美日反动派侵略政策
    据新华社东京二十二日电  日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》二十二日发表太田博的文章指出，佐藤政府最近大谈“向国外出兵”、“保卫冲绳”等问题，暴露了美日反动派急于加强侵略和战争体制的危险阴谋。
    文章回顾了美日反动派过去一直谈论日本派军队出国的问题。
    文章说，佐藤政府今年三月在国会里叫嚣“出兵国外”和“保卫冲绳”，同以往的情况不同，其真正的意图是修改现行“自卫队法”，佐藤本人在国会上关于“保卫冲绳”的多次发言，态度强硬，这表明佐藤政府企图以“自卫”为名向冲绳出动“自卫队”。由此可见，日本政府对“出兵国外”问题的态度比过去又进了好几步。文章指出：今天，美帝国主义已经深陷于侵越战争之中，它越来越想动员日本的人力和物力参加它的侵略和战争体制。而日本垄断资本也很想趁机捞一把，为美帝国主义火中取栗。
    文章最后说，佐藤政府挑起关于“出兵国外”和“保卫冲绳”等问题的辩论，表明美日反动派的战争和反动政策进一步深刻化，它正在受到日本人民的坚决反击。
    据新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：由新日本妇女会等三十多个组织发起的“第十一届中央劳动妇女大会”二十一日和二十二日在东京举行。
    会议通过决议，反对美帝国主义侵略越南和南越傀儡“总理”阮高其访问日本。决议表示声援越南妇女和人民抗美救国的斗争。
