    One Daring Act Conquers a Hundred Difficulties
    Worker of the No. 1 Iron Plant, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, Liu Baofa
    "One daring act conquers a hundred difficulties" is the heartfelt experience of the workers at the No. 5 blower station of our factory in summarizing the work of the first half of last year.
    The No. 5 blower station used to have poor equipment, and the machinery made a lot of noise when it was running, which was one difficulty. Most of the operators in the blower station were low-level workers who felt powerless in the face of this difficult-to-handle equipment, which was another difficulty. With so many difficulties, everyone became afraid, daring not to touch this or move that. As a result, the more they feared the faults, the more faults there were, and the more passive they became in their work.
    In the first half of last year, the workers at the No. 5 blower station studied Chairman Mao's work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with this problem in mind, and were greatly inspired and educated. They said, "If we bring forth the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and actively overcome difficulties, we can turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions." Therefore, everyone emancipated their minds, plucked up their courage, and adopted the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles to overcome difficulties one by one. If the equipment was not good, they would listen, watch, and inspect diligently to strengthen maintenance; if the machinery was noisy, they would use their brains and think of ways to improve the relief valve, reducing the noise by half; if their technical level was low, they would adopt the method of mutual teaching and learning, drawing on each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses, and conduct on-the-job technical training so that everyone could become a versatile worker, both a blower operator and an electrician. As the saying goes, difficulties only bully cowards. The workers at the blower station were originally afraid of difficulties, and difficulties often bullied them, but later they dared to act, and the difficulties were overcome one by one. Someone said, "Daring" is the starting point for success, and this is absolutely true.

    一敢降百难
    马鞍山钢铁公司一铁厂工人  刘宝发
    “一敢降百难”，这是我们厂五号风机站工人在总结去年上半年工作中的切身体会。
    五号风机站原来设备较差，机器运转起来噪音很大，这是一个难；风机站的操作人员多数都是低级工，在这个难侍候的设备面前，感到无能为力，这又是一个难。困难多了，大伙儿都产生了怕的心理，这也不敢动，那也不敢摸。结果，故障越怕越多，工作越做越被动。
    去年上半年，五号风机站工人，带着这个问题学习毛主席著作《愚公移山》，受到了很大的启发和教育。他们说：“我们拿出愚公移山的精神，积极克服困难，就能把不利条件变为有利条件。”于是，大家解放思想，鼓足勇气，采取集中力量打歼灭战的方法，克服一个个的困难。设备不好，他们就勤听、勤看、勤检查，加强维护保养；机器噪音大，他们就动脑筋，想办法，改进放风阀，使噪音降低了一半；技术水平低，就采取互教互学取长补短的方法，进行岗位技术练兵，使大伙儿都学成了多面手，既是风机工又是配电工。俗话说得好：困难专欺胆小人。风机站的工人们原来害怕困难，困难老欺他们，后来敢干，困难就被一个个克服了。有人说，“敢”字是成功的起点，这话说得一点不错。
