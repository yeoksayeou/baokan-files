    "Thai Patriotic Youth Association" Announces Establishment and Issues "Letter to Youth Compatriots"
    Calling for Struggle to Expel American Imperialism and Overthrow the Traitorous Government
    According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station, the "Thai Patriotic Youth Association" was declared established on February 15th of this year and issued a "Letter to Youth Compatriots," calling on the youth of Thailand to unite and, under the leadership of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, engage in a struggle for national salvation in order to expel American imperialism from Thailand, overthrow the Thanom-Praphas traitorous dictatorial government, and establish a government that pursues a policy of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.
    The "Letter to Youth Compatriots" of the "Thai Patriotic Youth Association" states: American imperialism is intensifying its efforts to control Thailand's politics, economy, military, culture, and education, transforming Thailand into a new type of colony in order to extract vast amounts of wealth from Thailand at will and use Thailand as a military base to interfere in and invade South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and other neighboring countries. The Thanom-Praphas government betrays the motherland, allowing American imperialism to trample on and destroy the country's independence and autonomy, while implementing dictatorial autocracy against the Thai people, completely depriving the people of their freedom rights with martial law, adopting various methods to exploit the people, and even brutally suppressing and killing the people with armed force, attempting to intimidate and suppress the Thai people's dissatisfaction.
      The "Letter to Youth Compatriots" states, "As long as American imperialism occupies Thailand and the Thanom-Praphas government remains in power, such situations will never change, but will only worsen. We must rise up and fight to the end to eliminate the nation's grave disasters and unbearable circumstances!"
      "Under the urgent circumstances and the demands of the vast number of patriotic youth friends, the Thai Patriotic Youth Association was declared established on February 15, 1966, aiming to unite all patriotic youth, form a solid force, and fight for the following goals:
      "1. To fight against American imperialism's aggression in politics, economy, military, culture, and education. To expel American imperialism from Thailand.
    "2. To fight for genuine democracy for the people. To oppose the Thanom-Praphas government's traitorous dictatorship and hegemonic behavior. To overthrow the Thanom-Praphas government and cooperate with the people of the whole country to establish a government that pursues a policy of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.
      "3. To fight for the rights that Thai youth deserve, to eliminate poverty, lack of education, lack of school buildings, and unemployment, so that the livelihoods and welfare of youth are guaranteed.
      "4. To oppose the corrupt and decadent culture and depraved and degenerate lifestyle of American imperialism that are poisoning and anesthetizing Thai youth. To fight for the development of Thailand's excellent national culture, customs, and morality. To promote the spirit of Thai youth loving freedom, being reasonable, being fair, valuing morality, and daring to sacrifice heroically for the collective.
      "5. To unite and support the youth of all countries who are fighting for independence, democracy, peace, and improved living standards, and to actively seek the support of the world's youth for the Thai youth's struggle for national salvation."
      The "Letter to Youth Compatriots" states: The "Patriotic Front of Thailand" has become the center for uniting all patriotic and democratic forces in the country. The "Thai Patriotic Youth Association" believes that it is necessary to join the "Patriotic Front of Thailand" as a group member from now on and accept the political leadership of the Patriotic Front of Thailand.
      The "Letter to Youth Compatriots" concludes, "The power of the people is powerful and irresistible. American imperialism is suffering repeated defeats in Vietnam and is surrounded by the people of the world. The Thanom-Praphas government is receiving the deserved lessons from our northeastern brothers and is also surrounded by the people of Thailand. The situation is very favorable to us. Let us unite closely, and victory will surely belong to us."

    “泰国爱国青年会”宣告成立并发表“告青年同胞书”
    号召奋起斗争赶走美帝推翻卖国政府
    据新华社二十四日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，“泰国爱国青年会”已经在今年二月十五日宣告成立，并且发表了“告青年同胞书”，号召泰国全国青年团结起来，在泰国爱国阵线领导下进行救国的斗争，以便把美帝国主义从泰国驱逐出去，推翻他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府，建立奉行独立、民主、和平、中立政策的政府。
    “泰国爱国青年会告青年同胞书”说：美帝国主义正在加紧全力控制泰国的政治、经济、军事、文化和教育，把泰国变成为新型的殖民地，以便随心所欲地从泰国搜刮大量财富，并利用泰国作为干涉侵略南越、老挝、柬埔寨和其他邻国的军事基地。他侬—巴博政府出卖祖国，让美帝国主义把国家的独立自主践踏、破坏得荡然无存，而对泰国人民却实行独裁专制，用戒严令完全剥夺人民的自由权，采取各种各样方法来剥削人民；以至残暴地武装镇压和杀害人民，企图威吓和抑制泰国人民的不满。
      “告青年同胞书”说，“只要美帝国主义还占领着泰国，他侬—巴博政府还当权，诸如此类的情形，决没有改变的日子，反而只会越来越恶化，我们必须起来为消灭民族的严重灾难和难以忍受下去的处境而斗争到底！”
      “在紧迫的形势和广大爱国青年朋友的要求之下，泰国爱国青年会于一九六六年二月十五日宣告成立，旨在团结所有的爱国青年，结成坚固的力量，为如下的目的而斗争：
      “一、为反对美帝国主义政治、经济、军事、文化和教育方面的侵略而斗争。把美帝国主义从泰国驱逐出去。
    “二、为人民的真正民主而斗争。反对他侬—巴博政府的卖国独裁和恶霸行为。推翻他侬—巴博政府，同全国人民合作，建立奉行独立、民主、和平、中立政策的政府。
      “三、为泰国青年应得的权利而斗争，消除贫困、失学、没有校舍、失业的情况，使青年的谋生和福利得到保障。
      “四、反对正在毒害麻醉泰国青年的美帝国主义的腐败堕落的文化和糜烂下流的生活方式。为发扬泰国民族的优秀文化、风尚和道德而斗争。提倡泰国青年爱自由，讲道理，秉公道，尚美德和为集体而敢于英勇牺牲的精神。
      “五、团结和支持正在为独立、民主、和平和改善生活而斗争的各国青年，并积极寻求世界青年对泰国青年的救国斗争的支持。”
      “告青年同胞书”说：“泰国爱国阵线”已成为团结全国一切爱国、爱民主力量的中心。“泰国爱国青年会”认为有必要从现在起加入“泰国爱国阵线”作为团体会员，并接受泰国爱国阵线的政治领导。
      “告青年同胞书”最后说，“人民的力量是强大的，也是不可抗拒的。美帝国主义在越南节节失败，并处在世界人民的包围中。他侬—巴博政府正受到东北兄弟们所给予的应有教训，同样的处在泰国全国人民的包围中，局势对我们是很有利的，让我们紧密团结一致，胜利一定属于我们。”
