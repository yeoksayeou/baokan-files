    The Vietnamese people have produced countless heroes in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Nguyen Van Thien, a young anti-aircraft gunner of a unit of the Vietnamese People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery force, has set up a brilliant example of revolutionary heroism for us. Currently, our people and army are learning from the revolutionary hard-bone spirit of Mai Xiande, a "Combat Hero" and steel warrior of the People's Liberation Army. The revolutionary hard-bone spirit of Nguyen Van Thien, a steel warrior of the Vietnamese People's Army, is equally worthy of our study.
    In the battle to defend the Ham Rong Bridge, Nguyen Van Thien was seriously wounded, his intestines spilling out. He endured the severe pain and resolutely continued fighting until he shot down the American air pirate. What tenacity, what bravery!
    The war has educated the Vietnamese people, especially the younger generation in Vietnam. Love for the motherland and deep hatred for the enemy have formed their high degree of political consciousness, bravery, fearlessness, and revolutionary spirit of sacrifice, enabling them to exert maximum combat effectiveness in battle, overcome all difficulties, and defeat the most ferocious enemy.
    Nguyen Van Thien's victory in battle is a victory of fully developing the human factor. His example proves once again that the spiritual atomic bomb, that is, people's thoughts and people's courage, is much stronger and more useful than the material atomic bomb. Today, the high degree of power of the Vietnamese people's war is because the Vietnamese people have mastered this spiritual atomic bomb and grasped the magic weapon to defeat American imperialism. In the face of the unparalleled power of the Vietnamese people's spiritual atomic bomb, in the face of the magic weapon of people's war, the American imperialism's sinister plan to expand its war of aggression will inevitably be thoroughly defeated.

    越南人民的精神原子弹
    在越南人民抗美救国斗争中，英雄辈出。越南人民军高射炮部队某部青年炮长阮文田，又在我们面前树立起一个革命英雄主义的光辉形象。目前，我国人民和军队正在学习人民解放军“战斗英雄”、钢铁战士麦贤得的革命硬骨头精神，越南人民军钢铁战士阮文田的革命硬骨头精神，同样是值得我们学习的。
    阮文田在保卫咸龙桥的战斗中，身负重伤，肠子流出，仍然忍受剧痛，坚决战斗，直到把美国空中强盗打落。这是何等的顽强，何等的英勇！
    战争教育了越南人民，特别是越南的年青一代。对祖国的热爱，对敌人的深仇，形成了他们高度的政治觉悟、勇敢无畏和革命牺牲精神，使他们在战斗中能够发挥最大的战斗力，克服一切困难，战胜最凶恶的敌人。
    阮文田在战斗中取得的胜利，是充分发挥人的因素的胜利。它的事例再一次证明，精神原子弹，即人的思想、人的勇敢，比物质原子弹强得多，有用得多。今天，越南人民战争威力的高度发挥，就是因为越南人民掌握了这种精神原子弹，掌握了战胜美帝国主义的法宝。在越南人民精神原子弹的无比威力面前，在人民战争的法宝面前，美帝国主义的扩大侵略战争的罪恶计划，必将遭到彻底的失败。
