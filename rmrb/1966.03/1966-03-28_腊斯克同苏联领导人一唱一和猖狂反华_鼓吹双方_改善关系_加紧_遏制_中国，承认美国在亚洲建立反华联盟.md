    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 26th: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, in a press conference on the 25th, echoed the Khrushchev revisionists, vehemently attacking China while emphasizing that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should further "improve relations" in order to oppose China "in parallel."

    Referring to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's reply to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on March 22nd, Rusk openly sided with the Khrushchev revisionists, viciously attacking China. He said, "I think what they said about not attending the meeting reflects once again the jealous attitude, belligerence, suspicion, and hatred that we have long seen from Peking." He threatened that "if Peking is prepared to coexist peacefully, there is no question of encircling Peking." The United States, he said, "has alliances" with Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the Park Chung-hee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which would "act" in the event of "aggression." He said, "The world simply does not want to accept the threats or intimidation from Peking," and China's "belligerent attitude is difficult to reconcile with the serious concern for maintaining peace in other parts of the world." "It is not easy to get along with the authorities in Peking in the world. The communist world has discovered this."

    In response to a reporter's question, Rusk attempted to deny that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were colluding to encircle China, using the excuse that the two countries had not conducted any "discussions of conspiracies against China." However, he then said that Washington and Moscow shared common views on the issue of war, and both sides "deeply understand what war means." He also said, "As far as Washington and Moscow are concerned, as far as we are concerned, we will continue to seek specific issues where we can improve relations." He particularly advocated that the U.S. and the Soviet Union quickly reach a deal on the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." He demanded that the Soviet Union, together with the United States, "focus on the issue of proliferation and not bring in extraneous or irrelevant issues" so that it could "quickly advance" toward the signing of this treaty.

    When asked by a reporter whether there was "any prospect of a change" in the United States' policy toward China, Rusk tried to put all the blame on China. However, he then emphasized that the United States' stubborn stance of hostility towards the Chinese people, occupying China's territory of Taiwan, refusing to recognize China, and obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations would not change. Rusk also said that the U.S. and China currently have "major, far-reaching, and dangerous differences on the Vietnam issue." He fantasized that the Chinese people would abandon their anti-American struggle and their resolute support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. He said shamelessly, "On that basis, relations could improve, and many things could happen."

    Referring to Vice President Humphrey's advocacy of "containment without isolation" of China, Rusk again admitted that the United States was pursuing an aggressive "containment policy" towards China.

    He said, "In connection with the word 'containment,' we already have a series of alliances," some of which are directly aimed at China. He also said, "Now we have established alliances in the Pacific and Asia because we have significant interests in peace in the Pacific and Asia. Therefore, if the total of our obligations in the Pacific adds up to the word 'containment,' then I have nothing to particularly object to."

    Speaking of so-called "non-isolation," Rusk indicated that this was merely a synonym for the United States' attempt to "infiltrate" China, attempting to promote a "peaceful evolution" conspiracy. But he admitted that in the face of the revolutionary Chinese people, this "effort has been of little use." He said, "We have made several efforts since I assumed my current position, but we have received no response or very little response from the other side."

    腊斯克同苏联领导人一唱一和猖狂反华
    鼓吹双方“改善关系”加紧“遏制”中国，承认美国在亚洲建立反华联盟
    新华社二十六日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克二十五日在记者招待会上同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者遥相配合，大肆攻击中国，同时强调美苏两国要进一步“改善关系”，以便
  “并行不悖地”反对中国。
    腊斯克在谈到中共中央三月二十二日给苏共中央的复信时，公然出面为赫鲁晓夫修正主义者帮腔，恶毒攻击中国。他说，“我想，他们在谈不参加会议时所说的话再一次反映了我们很久以来从北平那里看到的嫉愤态度、好战、猜疑和憎恨。”他威胁说，“如果北平准备和平共处，那就不存在什么包围北平的问题”，美国同日本、菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰、朴正熙集团和蒋介石集团“结成了联盟”，在“发生侵略时”，这些联盟就会“行动起来”。他说，“世界就是不愿接受北平发出来的威胁或恫吓”，中国的“好战态度同维护世界其他地区的和平的认真关心是难以协调的”，“在世界上同北平当局是不很容易相处的。共产党世界已经发现这一点”。
    腊斯克在回答记者提出的问题时，以美苏两国并未进行过任何“反对中国的阴谋的讨论”为托词，力图否认美苏正在进行勾结，包围中国。但是，他接着说，华盛顿和莫斯科在战争问题上有共同的见解，双方“确实非常深刻了解战争意味着什么”。他还说，“就华盛顿和莫斯科而言，就我们方面而言，我们将继续寻求一些我们可以改善关系的具体问题”。他在这方面特别鼓吹美苏两国迅速在所谓“防止核扩散”问题上做成交易。他要求苏联同美国一起，“集中精力于扩散问题，而不把题外的或无关的问题扯进来”，这样就可以向签订这项条约“迅速地前进”。
    谈到记者提出的美国的对华政策“有没有改变的前景”的问题时，腊斯克力图把一切罪过推给中国。但是，他接着强调，美国敌视中国人民、霸占中国的领土台湾、拒绝承认中国以及阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位的顽固立场不会改变。腊斯克还说，中美两国“目前在越南问题上有重大的、影响深远的、危险的分歧”。他异想天开地要中国人民放弃反美斗争，放弃对越南人民的抗美救国斗争的坚决支持。他无耻地说，“在那种基础上，关系就可能改善，许多事情就可能发生。”
    腊斯克在谈到美国副总统汉弗莱鼓吹的对中国“遏制而不孤立”的主张时再次承认，美国正对中国奉行侵略性的“遏制政策”。
    他说，“在联系到‘遏制’这个字的方面，我们已经有了一系列的联盟”，其中一些的矛头是直接针对中国的。他还说，“现在我们在太平洋和亚洲都建立了联盟，因为我们在太平洋和亚洲的和平中有着重大利益。因此，如果我们在太平洋的义务的总共加起来就等于‘遏制’这个字的话，那么我对此是没有什么要特别加以反对的。”
    谈到所谓“不孤立”，腊斯克表明，这不过是美国力图对中国进行“渗透”，妄图推行“和平演变”阴谋的同义语。但是他承认，在革命的中国人民面前，这种“努力一直没有什么用处”。他说，“自从我担任目前职位以来我们做过好几次努力，然而从对方并没有得到什么回答或者只是得到很少的回答。”
