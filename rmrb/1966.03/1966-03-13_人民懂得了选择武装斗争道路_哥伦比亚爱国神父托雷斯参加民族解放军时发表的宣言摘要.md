    The People Understand the Path of Armed Struggle
    Excerpts from the Declaration of Patriotic Colombian Priest Torres Upon Joining the National Liberation Army

    Colombian patriotic priest Torres issued a declaration earlier this year when he joined the National Liberation Army, stating:

    For many years, the poor of our motherland have been awaiting the call to battle in order to engage in a final struggle against the oligarchy. When the people are driven to utter despair, the ruling class always finds a way to deceive them, appeasing them with new forms, but the result is always the same: the people suffer, and the privileged classes prosper.

    When the people demand peace, the oligarchy plunges the country into violence. When the people can no longer endure the violence and organize guerrilla forces to seize power, the oligarchy stages military coups, forcing the deceived guerrillas to surrender. When the people demand democracy, they are once again deceived with plebiscites and national fronts, and the dictatorship of the oligarchy is imposed upon them.

    Now, the people will no longer be easily deceived. The people do not believe in elections. The people understand that the legal path has been exhausted. The people understand that only the path of armed struggle remains. The people are desperate, and they are determined to risk their lives so that the next generation of Colombians will no longer be enslaved, so that the children of those who are willing to dedicate their lives now can be educated, have housing, have food, have clothing, and especially have dignity; so that future Colombians can have a motherland of their own, not dependent on the power of the United States.

    All sincere revolutionaries should recognize that the path of armed struggle is the only way out left, and the people expect leaders to issue a call to battle with their example and their personal participation.

    I have joined the armed struggle. From the mountains, seize power for the people. I joined the National Liberation Army because, in the National Liberation Army, I found the same ideals as the united front. It seeks to liberate the people from the oligarchy and imperialism. It will not lay down its arms until power is completely in the hands of the people.

    All patriotic Colombians, we must prepare for war. Experienced guerrilla leaders will gradually emerge in all corners of the country. At the same time, we must remain vigilant. We must test those who call themselves revolutionaries. We must abandon those traitors. We will not stop acting, but we are not impatient either. In a long war, everyone should act at the appropriate moment.

    Vow to fight to the death to seize power for the people!

    Hold high the slogan of the National Liberation Army until final victory:

    Never retreat a step...Vow to fight for liberation!

    人民懂得了选择武装斗争道路
    哥伦比亚爱国神父托雷斯参加民族解放军时发表的宣言摘要
    哥伦比亚爱国神父托雷斯今年年初参加民族解放军时曾经发表一项宣言说：
    多年以来，我们祖国的穷人们一直期待着战斗的呼声，以便投入反对寡头势力的最后斗争。在人民绝望到极端的时候，统治阶级总是找个办法来欺骗人民，用一些新的形式安抚人心，而结果总是一个：人民受苦，特权阶层享福。
    当人民要求和平的时候，寡头势力把国家置于暴力活动中。当人民不能再忍受暴力活动而组织了游击队以便夺取政权时，寡头势力制造了军事政变使受骗的游击队投降。当人民要求民主时，就再次用公民投票和全国阵线来欺骗人民，把寡头势力的独裁政府强加在人民头上。
    现在，人民决不再轻信了。人民不相信选举。人民懂得合法的道路已经走完了。人民懂得只剩下了一条武装斗争的道路。人民绝望了，他们决心豁出生命，以便使下一代的哥伦比亚人不再受奴役，使现在愿意贡献出生命的那些人的儿女能受教育、有住房、有饭吃、有衣穿，特别是有尊严；使未来的哥伦比亚人能够有一个自己的、不依靠于美国强权的祖国。
    一切真诚的革命者都应当承认武装斗争的道路是剩下的唯一出路，人民期待着领导人以他们的榜样和他们的亲自参加来发出战斗的呼声。
    我已经参加武装斗争了。从山区为人民夺取政权。我参加民族解放军是因为，在民族解放军中我找到了与统一战线相同的理想。它所寻求的是使人民摆脱寡头集团和帝国主义而取得解放。只要政权还没有完全落到人民的手中，它就不放下武器。
    全体爱国的哥伦比亚人，我们应当准备战争。在全国所有的角落将逐步涌现出有经验的游击队领导人。与此同时我们必须保持戒备。我们要考验那些自称为革命者的人。我们要抛弃那些叛徒，我们不会停止行动，但是我们也不急躁。在一场长期的战争中，所有的人都应当在适当的时刻采取行动。
    誓死为人民阶级夺取政权！！
    高举民族解放军的口号一直到最后胜利：
    决不后退一步……誓死争取解放！
