    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 27th – According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 26th: In their counterattacks against the offensives of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the militia and guerrillas of the Lao provinces of Saravane, Xieng Khouang, and Khammouane have struck the enemy everywhere and achieved victories.
    On the 18th, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys dispatched a contingent of troops to attack the Ban Giet Fang liberated area north of Khong Sedone in Saravane Province. The local militia and guerrillas engaged in heroic combat, killing 27 enemy soldiers, capturing 7, wounding many others, and seizing two 57mm recoilless guns, a large amount of ammunition, and military supplies.
    On the same day, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys also dispatched a contingent of troops to attack the Phou Fang area in Xieng Khouang Province. Local militia and guerrillas killed 7 enemy soldiers on the spot, captured 2, and seized 9 weapons.
    The radio station said that the military and civilians of Muang Khoua in Sam Neua Province, in order to protect the liberated areas and the lives and property of the people, have actively counterattacked the enemy since the beginning of January this year, killing a total of 41 enemy soldiers, wounding 15, forcing 168 enemy soldiers to surrender, and seizing 73 various weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published a commentary on the 24th, warmly cheering the continuous victories achieved by the Lao patriotic army and people in fighting against the U.S. aggressors and their followers. The commentary pointed out that these victories have confirmed the determination, courage, and growing strength of the Lao patriotic army and people in their just struggle to defend the national independence, sovereignty, and neutrality of Laos and to defend the liberated areas.
    The commentary said that at present, the U.S. imperialists and pro-American forces in Laos are still persisting in their sinister plots. U.S. imperialists continue to send aircraft to carry out indiscriminate bombing of central and lower Laos and are also plotting to deploy U.S. troops to attack and occupy these areas. The U.S. aim is to undermine the independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and peace of Laos and to expand the U.S. war of aggression in Indochina.
    *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* also published a commentary on the 24th on the great victories of the Lao military and civilians, saying that the extremely heroic battles waged by the Lao patriotic military and civilians to defend the revolutionary achievements of Laos are also a beautifully coordinated action with the military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam, severely striking the U.S. bandits' conspiracy and plan to expand the war on the Indochinese Peninsula.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command sent a letter on the 23rd to the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, warmly congratulating the Lao patriotic military and civilians on their brilliant achievement of shooting down 300 aircraft of the U.S. and its puppets from May 17 of the year before last to February 9 of this year.
    The letter said that this achievement has greatly encouraged the South Vietnamese military and civilians who are engaged in the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle. (Attached photo)

    发挥人民战争威力　到处英勇打击敌人
    老挝解放区民兵游击队反击获胜
    南越解放武装力量指挥部祝贺老挝爱国军民击落美机三百架
    越南报纸欢呼老挝爱国军民在同美伪作战中不断取得新胜利
    新华社康开二十七日电  据巴特寮电台二十六日广播：老挝沙拉湾、川圹、甘蒙等省民兵和游击队在反击美帝国主义及其走狗的进攻中，到处打击敌人，取得了胜利。
    美帝国主义及其走狗十八日派遣一批军队进攻沙拉湾省孔塞东以北的班结芳解放区。当地的民兵和游击队进行了英勇的战斗，打死敌人二十七名，俘虏七名，打伤多名，缴获五十七毫米口径无后座力炮两门、大批弹药和军用物资。
    同一天，美帝国主义及其走狗还派遣一批军队进攻川圹省富芳地区，当地民兵和游击队当场打死敌人七名，俘虏两名，缴获武器九件。
    这家电台说，桑怒省芒川科军民为保卫解放区和人民的生命财产，从今年一月初以来积极反击敌人，共打死敌人四十一名，打伤十五名，迫使一百六十八名敌人投诚，缴获各种武器七十三件。
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》二十四日发表评论，热烈欢呼老挝爱国军民在同美国侵略者及其仆从进行战斗中不断取得的胜利。评论指出，这些胜利证实了老挝爱国军民在保卫老挝民族独立、主权和中立，保卫解放区的正义斗争中所表现的决心、勇敢和日益壮大的力量。
    评论说，目前美帝国主义者和老挝亲美势力还在坚持他们的不可告人的图谋。美帝国主义者继续出动飞机对中寮和下寮进行狂轰滥炸，还阴谋调美国军队来进攻和占领这些地区。美国的目的是要破坏老挝的独立、主权、中立与和平，扩大美国在印度支那的侵略战争。
    《人民军队报》二十四日也就老挝军民的巨大胜利发表评论说，老挝爱国军民为保卫老挝的革命成果而进行的极其英勇的战斗，也是同越南南北两地区军民进行配合得非常漂亮的行动，沉重打击了美国强盗在印度支那半岛上扩大战争的阴谋和计划。
    据新华社河内二十七日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量指挥部二十三日写信给老挝人民解放军最高指挥部以及老挝爱国中立力量军事指挥部，热烈祝贺老挝爱国军民从前年五月十七日到今年二月九日击落美国及其傀儡的飞机三百架的辉煌战绩。
    信件说，这一战绩大大地鼓舞了正在进行的抗美救国斗争的越南南方军民。（附图片）
