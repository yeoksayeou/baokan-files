    "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty to win victory"
    Rescue work in the Xingtai earthquake zone progresses rapidly
    Under the warm care of the Party and the government, the strong support of the People's Liberation Army and all sides, the people in the disaster area are fighting tenaciously, helping each other, and the problems of life and medical treatment have been generally arranged. Villages with lighter disaster situations have begun to resume production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, 13th - After the strong earthquake in the Xingtai area of ​​Hebei Province, thanks to the enthusiastic care of the Party and the government and the strong support from all sides, and thanks to the tenacious and unyielding struggle and mutual assistance of the people in the disaster-stricken area, the relief work has made rapid progress in just a few days, the lives of the masses have been arranged, and villages with lighter disaster situations have begun to resume production.
    According to reports from our agency's reporters on the scene, the problems of food, housing, and medical treatment for the affected people have been generally arranged in some areas where the disaster is relatively serious. In some villages where the disaster is relatively light, the commune members are repairing farm tools and houses, and some have already gone to the fields with hoes.
    The disaster relief headquarters has focused its work on areas more severely affected by the disaster, leading the masses to go all out to carry out disaster relief work. The most effective factor in the rapid progress of disaster relief work is that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has played the role of a work team in a combat posture. The commanders and fighters, with a high degree of class feeling, are doing everything possible to do good things for the masses. They go deep into villages and households, visit and inquire about the disaster, convey the concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and inspire the fighting spirit of the masses. When completing various tasks, they are not afraid of difficulties or hardship, and especially emphasize doing things deeply, carefully, quickly, and well. When an engineering unit was building a bridge, many soldiers' hands were broken, but they did not rest. After a day and night of hard work, they completed the task one day ahead of schedule. The soldiers said: "Paving the earth, covering the blue sky, and suffering for the people, we are willing to do so." It is precisely because the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and cadres at all levels have carried out their work with selfless spirit that all disaster areas have helped the masses quickly arrange their lives with amazing speed and efficiency. In some severely affected villages, relevant departments promptly transported sufficient food and cooked food, and supplied it door-to-door to teams. Now, families whose houses were severely damaged in the earthquake have set up stoves to cook.
    In villages where houses have collapsed, temporary simple houses have been built to resettle the affected people. The disaster relief headquarters requires that these simple houses be earthquake-resistant, wind-resistant, rain-resistant, and cold-resistant, and sends people to inspect them. Any that do not fully meet these requirements will be immediately repaired. At the same time, the disaster relief headquarters also sends cadres to conduct in-depth investigations, solicit opinions from the masses, and help the masses formulate design plans for rebuilding new houses and the required material allocation plans. After arranging their lives, a production brigade that was severely affected by the disaster has preliminarily formulated a plan on how to rebuild their homes, preparing to complete the construction of six hundred new houses before June this year.
    With the full rescue efforts of medical personnel, the injured masses have generally received treatment. Some "field hospitals" capable of performing surgery have been established in the central area of ​​the earthquake zone. People with more serious injuries have been sent to city hospitals near the disaster area, while those with minor injuries are treated locally. Some have recovered their health, and some have also participated in disaster relief work.
    Reporters saw on the scene that in some villages with relatively light disasters, the commune members generally went to the fields to work, some hoeing wheat, some harrowing the land to preserve moisture. Some are sending manure to the fields. They said that the disaster must not be allowed to affect production, and they must make greater efforts to overcome the disaster. In one village, the commune members have plowed 400 mu of land in the past two days.
    The cadres and masses in the disaster area have fully estimated the difficulties brought about by this earthquake disaster; but they have expressed that they will never bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They are carrying forward the hard-bone spirit of daring to struggle and not fearing difficulties, and are tenaciously engaged in the disaster relief struggle. In the past few days, many grassroots cadres and Communist Party members have held meetings with the masses, and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the favorable factors under difficult conditions. At a mass meeting, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members of a production brigade pointed out the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties to everyone. The commune members pooled their wisdom and efforts to turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. They cleared the collapsed houses, and used a large amount of old wall soil and kang-base soil as fertilizer; because the earthquake caused the groundwater to rise, they decided to use this groundwater to irrigate drought-stricken farmland; some wheat fields have improved soil moisture, and they are preparing to apply chemical fertilizers to the wheat. The masses in the disaster area said that as long as they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of not fearing difficulties and persisting in the struggle, and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, they will certainly be able to overcome the disaster. Now, many slogans are posted on trees and walls in the village, some of which are written with Chairman Mao's quotations: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty to win victory."

    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”
    邢台地震区救灾工作迅速进展
    灾区群众在党和政府的关怀、解放军和各方的大力支援下，顽强斗争，互助互救，生活问题和伤病治疗问题普遍得到了安排，灾情较轻的村庄开始恢复生产。
    新华社邢台十三日电　河北省邢台地区发生强烈地震以后，由于党和政府的热情关怀和各方面的大力支援，由于受灾地区群众顽强不屈的斗争和互助互救，在短短几天之内，救灾工作已取得了迅速进展，群众的生活得到安排，灾情较轻的村庄已开始恢复生产。
    据本社记者从现场报道，目前在一些灾情比较严重的地方，受灾群众的吃、住和伤病治疗等问题，已经普遍得到安排。一些灾情比较轻的村庄，社员们正在整修农具，整修房屋，有的已经荷锄下地。
    救灾指挥部把工作的重点放在受灾比较严重的地方，领导群众全力以赴地进行抗灾工作。救灾工作能够取得迅速进展，最得力的是中国人民解放军以战斗的姿态发挥了工作队的作用。指战员们怀着高度的阶级感情，想尽各种办法来为群众办好事。他们深入各村各户，访灾问苦，转达党中央和毛主席的关怀，鼓舞群众的斗志。在完成各项任务时，他们不怕难，不怕苦，特别强调要做得深，做得细，做得快，做得好。有一个工兵分队在架桥时，不少战士把手都震破了，也不休息，经过一昼夜的奋战，提前一天完成任务。战士们说：铺大地，盖蓝天，为人民吃苦，心甘情愿。正由于解放军指战员以及各级干部以忘我的精神开展工作，各灾区都以惊人的速度和效率帮助群众迅速安排了生活。有些受灾严重的村庄，有关部门及时运来足够的粮食和熟食，上队上门供应。现在，地震中房屋受到破坏较大的家庭，已搭起锅灶做饭。
    在房屋倒塌的村庄，已经修起临时的简易住房安置受灾的群众。救灾指挥部要求这种简易房屋能够防震、防风、防雨和防寒，并且派人进行检查，凡是不完全符合这种要求的，都立即进行修缮。与此同时，救灾指挥部还派干部深入调查，征求群众意见，帮助群众制定重建新房的设计方案和所需的物资调配计划。有一个受灾较严重的生产大队，在安排了生活之后，社员们对下一步如何重建家园，已初步订出规划，准备在今年六月份以前，完成六百间新房的修建任务。
    在医务人员的全力抢救下，受伤的群众已普遍得到治疗。在地震区的中心地带，建立了一些能够动手术的“战地医院”。受伤较重的人已被送到灾区附近的城市医院，伤势较轻的就地治疗，有的人已经恢复健康，有的人还参加救灾工作。
    记者从现场看到，在一些灾情比较轻的村庄，社员们普遍下地劳动，有的在锄麦，有的耙地保墒。有的正往田间送粪。他们说，绝不能让灾害影响了生产，一定要加倍努力战胜灾害。有一个村庄，社员们在最近两天就翻耕了四百亩土地。
    灾区的干部和群众，充分地估计了这次地震灾害所带来的困难；但他们表示绝不在困难面前低头。他们正在发扬敢于斗争、不怕困难的硬骨头精神，顽强地投入抗灾斗争。这几天来，许多基层干部和共产党员同群众在一起开会，按照毛主席的教导，分析困难条件下的有利因素。有一个生产大队的共产党员和共青团员在群众会上，向大家指出了克服困难的有利条件。社员们群策群力，变不利条件为有利条件。他们把倒塌的房屋清理出来，把大批旧墙土和炕坯土用作肥料；由于地震而使地下水上升，他们决定利用这些地下水浇灌受旱的农田；有些麦地由于墒情变好，他们正准备给小麦追施化肥。灾区群众说，只要高举毛泽东思想红旗，发扬不怕困难坚持斗争的精神，把不利转化为有利，就一定能够战胜灾害。现在，在村头的树上和墙上贴了许多标语，有的写了毛主席的语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。
