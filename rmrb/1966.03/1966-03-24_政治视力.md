    "Political Eyesight"
    Cheng Fang
    After seeing the one-act play "I Saw It" (published in the March 12th *People's Daily*), I am happy for poor peasant woman Auntie Shu's regained sight, and also happy for Doctor Qiao's transformation.

    Auntie Shu's eyes were bad from early on. According to Doctor Qiao's diagnosis, she had cataracts, congenital microcornea, iris defects, and almost no light perception... It seemed like a chronic and stubborn disease; her eyesight was practically zero. The play doesn't say how Doctor Qiao's eyesight was, but it seems like it was normal. Even if there were some problems, they weren't comparable to Auntie Shu's.

    But when it comes to political eyesight, Auntie Shu is more than a match for Doctor Qiao. The old society threw her into the eighteenth level of hell, taking away her husband and children. She deeply hates this class oppression. The new society lifted her to the heavens, making her the master of society. Her love for the Party and Chairman Mao is fervent. Class love and hate make her heart closely adhere to socialism, forging a noble character. Although her physical eyes are crippled, her political eyes are bright, shining, and piercing.

    Doctor Qiao's physical eyes may not show any abnormalities, but his political eyes clearly have symptoms. As the attending ophthalmologist, with "rich clinical experience," he should have used his technical expertise to solve the difficult problems of the working people. Who knew that he was afraid of leaving his "foreign crutches," afraid of violating "conventions," afraid of taking risks, afraid of "leaving himself open to criticism," afraid of "drawing a tiger and getting a dog".... All these fears made him hesitate, sigh, and ultimately just pay lip service.

    Political eyesight is much more important than physical eyesight. Auntie Shu's political eyes are clear, allowing her to overcome difficulties and "find ways to make a living" for the collective. Doctor Qiao's political eyesight is short-sighted, making him retreat in the face of difficulty, painstakingly "convincing" himself and others to retreat.

    Politics first, this is undeniable. With a red ideology, you can expect strong skills. If the "self" is deeply rooted in the soul, like Doctor Qiao, even if his skills seem strong at normal times, he will immediately reveal his weakness at critical moments.

    I must thank Auntie Shu. Thanks to the light of her political eyes, Doctor Qiao finally saw the "cataracts" in his own thinking. From seeing to removing those "cataracts," there will certainly be a process, but a correct diagnosis is always an important beginning.

    When Auntie Shu agreed to let Doctor Qiao treat her, she didn't expect that she was also acting as Doctor Qiao's "doctor." This is understandable. But as medical workers, when serving the working people, they must not forget to also "seek medical advice" from the working people, so that their thinking becomes redder and their character becomes purer. Doctor Qiao provides many lessons, but this one should be first.

    “政治视力”
    承放
    看独幕话剧《我看见了》
  （载三月十二日《人民日报》）以后，为贫农舒大娘的复明高兴，也为乔大夫的转变欢喜。
    舒大娘打早眼睛就不好使，按乔大夫诊断，是白内障，先天性小角膜，虹膜缺损，光感几乎没有……看样子，够得上是沉疴痼疾，视力是等于零的。乔大夫的视力如何，剧中没有交代，看样子，是属于正常一类，即使有点毛病，也不是舒大娘所能比的。
    可是要论政治视力，舒大娘比乔大夫，怕就胜了不止一筹。旧社会把她打入十八层地狱，夺走了她的丈夫和儿女，这阶级恨，她恨得深；新社会使她一步登天，当了社会的主人，这对党和毛主席的热爱，她爱得切。阶级的爱与恨，使她的心紧紧贴上了社会主义，铸出一身高贵的品质。生理的眼睛虽说残废了，政治的眼睛却光闪闪，亮晶晶，炯炯照人的。
    乔大夫生理的眼睛虽说未见异常，政治的眼睛分明是有症候。他是眼科主治医生，又“临床经验丰富”，碰上劳动人民的疑难病症，正需要他发挥技术专长，尽可能破疑解难，谁料他怕离开“洋拐棍”，怕犯了“惯例”，怕冒风险，怕“留下话柄”，怕“画虎不成反类犬”，……被这一大堆怕字，闹得踟蹰踯躅，摇首兴叹，最终还是敷衍了之。
    政治视力比起生理视力来，实在是重要得多。舒大娘的政治眼睛透亮，就能踏破困难走路，为集体“变着法儿找活干”；乔大夫的政治视力短浅，就见难思退，费尽心思“说服”自己退却，也“说服”别人退却。
    政治第一，这是驳不倒的。思想红，就能指望技术硬。灵魂深处扎下了“我”字，象乔大夫，即使平时看去技术还硬，碰上紧要关头，便立即露出软来。
    还得感谢那个舒大娘，借她政治眼睛的光，乔大夫终于看见了自己思想上的“白内障”。从看见到取出那个“白内障”，当然要有一个过程，不过正确的诊断，总是重要的开始。
    舒大娘在答应乔大夫给自己治病的时候，不曾想到自己也做了乔大夫的“医生”，这是可以理解的；作为医务工作者，在为劳动人民服务的时候，可千万不要忘记也向劳动人民“求医”，以使思想更红，人更纯粹。乔大夫给人的启示很多，这一条该数第一。
