    A Trip to Northern Europe
    Chinese Journalists Delegation
    Last autumn, our delegation of four Chinese journalists, at the invitation of the governments of the four Nordic countries, visited Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark for a month-long friendly visit.
        
        The Enchanting Scenery of Lakes and Mountains
    Anyone who has been to Northern Europe will admire its beautiful scenery. We also feel this deeply. We visited more than twenty cities in Northern Europe and passed through many rural areas. The scenery of lakes and mountains, lush forests, rolling hills, and flat plains, with their varied and fascinating forms, is captivating. The capitals of the four countries each have their own style. Helsinki, bordering the bay to the south and surrounded by lakes, is known as the white city situated between the blue sea and gray sky, appearing clean and bright. Stockholm is composed of numerous large and small islands, with crisscrossing harbors and rivers, many wide bridges, and bustling streets intertwined with clear waters. Oslo leans against the mountains and faces the sea, with high mountains, lakes, and dense forests. Copenhagen is surrounded by the Baltic Sea and shaded by green trees. Each of these cities has its own unique style.
    The four Nordic countries established diplomatic relations with our country relatively early. Finland, Sweden, and Denmark established diplomatic relations with our country in 1950, and Norway also established diplomatic relations with our country in 1954. The Swedish Minister of the Interior, Runa Johansson, the Finnish Minister of Trade and Industry, Vehmas, the Danish Minister of Commerce, Jensøn, and the former Norwegian Minister of Industry, Trasti, visited our country in 1962, 1963, and 1965, respectively. In June and July 1965, the Chinese government's economic and trade delegations visited Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, respectively, and visited Finland in September of the same year. Since 1961, there have been relatively frequent mutual exchanges between our country and the four Nordic countries involving agricultural, industrial, cultural, medical, writers, youth, and sports delegations. The friendly exchanges over the years have enhanced understanding and friendship between the people of our country and the four Nordic countries.
    In each country, our delegation received a friendly reception. The Foreign Ministers (Ministers) of Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, and the Minister of Culture and Education of Norway met with our delegation and had cordial conversations. The Ministers of Trade and Industry (Ministers) of Finland, Norway, and Denmark each met with our delegation and hosted banquets to welcome us. Other officials responsible for foreign affairs, finance, trade, culture, and education also had contact with our delegation, introducing the situation and answering questions.
          
        The Wealth of the Forest Kingdom
    As guests of the host country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we were arranged to visit various parts of the country. Wherever we went, we received warm and friendly receptions and saw things that interested us.
    The forests of Northern Europe leave a deep impression. Finland and Sweden are countries with abundant forest resources. The forest cover rate in Sweden is 52 percent, while in Finland it reaches 71 percent. When we visited the forestry school in Kuopio, Finland, the host led us into the forest to see it. The mountains were not high, but the forest was very deep. Pine trees with straight and tall stems are the main species here. Tower-shaped spruce trees with coniferous leaves and birch trees with white trunks all grow vigorously. We did not see many forest industrial enterprises, only a cardboard factory in Tampere and a wooden factory in Kuopio, but we learned from relevant departments in Finland that Finland's national economy is basically determined by forests and timber; its products account for three-quarters of the total export value. In Finland, most of the forests are privately owned. Seventy percent of the timber put on the market in Finland comes from private forest owners; they are both forest owners and agricultural owners.
    Agriculture is quite developed in some Nordic countries, such as Denmark and Sweden.
    We visited the Skåne region of Sweden and visited a manor owned by a land surveyor. Agricultural workers there demonstrated the operation of agricultural machinery for us. Modern agricultural machinery created by Swedish workers and farmers, such as grass cutters, harvesters, or automatic milking machines, are highly efficient. The Skåne region has fertile soil and is known as the "breadbasket of Sweden." These hardworking people create "bread," but, of course, how the "bread" is distributed is another matter. We visited the Skåne Dairy and the Skåne Meat Processing Plant, both of which have modern equipment. According to the person in charge who accompanied us, the products of the Skåne Dairy account for 20 percent of the butter sold in the eastern region of Malmöhus County.
    We also visited a dairy factory in Aarhus, Denmark, which is famous for manufacturing cheese.
           
        What We Saw in Cities and Factories
    During our month in Northern Europe, we traveled mostly in cities and saw mostly industry.
    We visited Kiruna, the northernmost city in Sweden. It is located 132 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. There, we visited a large iron ore mine, with an annual output of 15 million tons. We boarded a tour bus and drove into the tunnels of the mine. The tunnels inside the mine were wide, with asphalt pavement and a slope of no more than one to nine, leading to various horizontal working faces. We saw the miners' cafeteria at a depth of more than one hundred meters, and we saw workers operating the Simba 22 dual-drill rod top drill car at a depth of more than two hundred meters. This type of drill car is a product of the Swedish Atlas Copco, which we had visited. We also visited the operation and dispatch room at the bottom of the mine. We returned to the surface from four hundred meters below ground. The total length of the tunnels was thirty-five kilometers, like a huge underground city.
    We visited the fertilizer plant of the Norwegian Hydroelectric Company on Herøya Island in Norway. There, we saw urea ready to be shipped to our country. This company's trade with our country began ten years ago. Taking urea as an example, it exported 1,000 tons to our country in 1956, which increased to 3,000 tons in 1958, and increased to 27,000 tons in 1964. The overall trend is increasing. The person in charge of the company talked to us about trade between China and Norway, showing a strong interest.
    In Denmark, we visited three different types of factories that manufacture refrigeration equipment. Atlas Refrigerator Factory manufactures seawater ice-making equipment, complete sets of freeze-drying equipment, and slaughtering equipment. Gram Brothers Refrigeration Company manufactures household refrigerators, large commercial refrigeration equipment, and refrigerated vehicles suitable for transportation. Danfoss mainly manufactures parts and components for automatic control of refrigeration systems, rather than complete sets of freezing equipment. Based on the manufacture of refrigeration control components, it has developed control components for various temperatures, various heat and cold sources, as well as electrical and hydraulic controls. We visited the production workshops of these three factories and saw their product showrooms. Denmark is a country with a relatively developed animal husbandry processing industry, with a large number of exports of meat, dairy products, and poultry eggs, so it attaches great importance to the refrigeration industry. From what we saw, refrigeration technology in Denmark is widely used in food processing, storage, transportation, sales, and household consumption.
    Other large industrial units we visited included the Burmeister & Wain shipyard in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Bergen shipyard in Norway. The Burmeister & Wain shipyard has recently produced 57,000-ton freighters, which use the method of producing hull blocks in prefabricated workshops and sending them to the dock for final assembly. This shipyard also produces marine diesel engines, with an annual output of about 350,000 horsepower of large marine diesel engines, which is a considerable capacity. The Bergen shipyard can build ships with a displacement of 37,000 tons. We boarded a newly built 20,000-ton freighter to view the equipment in the cabin. We visited the engine manufacturing workshop. According to the introduction, it began producing two series of diesel engines of its own design after 1945.
    
        At the Former Residences of Ibsen and Andersen
    During our visit to Northern Europe, we visited some palaces, historical sites, and cultural relics in various countries. The former residence of Ibsen in Norway and the Andersen Museum in Denmark aroused our strong interest.
    Ibsen's former residence is at the Venstøp farm in Skien. This was a villa of his father. After his family went bankrupt, the whole family moved here. Ibsen wrote many famous plays and shaped various images of bourgeois characters. Of course, Ibsen had his limitations of the times. His famous play "The Wild Duck" was directly created with this house as the background. We visited Ibsen's living room and the room where he wrote, and saw some of his manuscripts and photos of the people around him. In a room, there were photos of the China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Nora" in July 1956, which was held in Beijing to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ibsen's death. In the photos, there is a group photo of the famous Norwegian female director Mrs. Geda Lynn and all the actors. She was invited to Beijing as the artistic consultant for "Nora". These photos symbolize the friendship between the people of China and Norway.
    The Andersen Museum is located in Odense, in the center of Funen Island, Denmark. The person in charge of the museum expressed a warm welcome to our delegation. Pointing to the colorful murals on the walls of the small round hall, he introduced Andersen's life. Although Andersen is a Danish writer, we Chinese people are very familiar with him. His fairy tales have profound meanings, and we can see the cruelty and ridiculousness of the feudal ruling class; we can see the hard work and wisdom of the people, but living a tragic life. Anyone who has read Andersen's fairy tales will leave a deep impression. We walked through every exhibition room of the museum with great interest. The first small room on the left at the entrance is where Andersen was born on April 2, 1805. The museum has many of Andersen's manuscripts and versions of Andersen's works published in various periods and around the world. Among them, there are more than a dozen versions published in China, which is obviously only a small part of the Andersen's fairy tales published in our country. The paintings and sculptures displayed here are very moving.
    During our visit to Northern Europe, we had the most contact with friends from the press. In each country, the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs always organized a meeting between our delegation and friends from the press; our embassy held a reception for our delegation, and the guests who attended were mainly well-known figures from the press. We visited many newspapers and radio stations in the cities we visited, and also accepted interviews with local reporters. We had friendly and frank conversations with our Nordic colleagues. We elaborated on our views on international issues that everyone was interested in. Judging from the questions raised by the other party, friends from the press in the four Nordic countries have a great interest in New China and hope to understand the situation in various aspects of our country. Therefore, conducting friendly exchanges in various aspects and expressing our opinions frankly is undoubtedly appropriate and beneficial to enhancing mutual understanding and promoting friendship between the people of China and the four Nordic countries.
    We thank the governments of the four Nordic countries for their invitation, which gave us the opportunity to visit Northern Europe for a month. The beautiful scenery of Northern Europe, the hardworking people, the hospitable traditions, and the friendly reception we received wherever we went left us with a deep impression.

    北欧纪行
    中国新闻工作者代表团
    去年秋天，我们中国新闻工作者代表团一行四人，应北欧四国政府的邀请，前往芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦四个国家，进行为时一月的友好访问。
        湖光山色引人入胜
    凡是到过北欧的人，都会赞赏那里的风景秀丽。我们也深有此感。我们到过北欧二十几个城市，经过不少乡村，湖光山色，森林茂盛，山峦起伏，平原坦荡，千姿百态，引人入胜。四国的首都，各具风格。赫尔辛基南临海湾，周围依傍湖泊，人称座落在蓝色的海和灰色天空之间的白色的城市，显得整洁而明朗。斯德哥尔摩由众多的大小岛屿组成，港湾河道交错，宽敞的桥梁特多，繁华的街道和清澈的水面交织在一起。奥斯陆靠山面海，高山湖泊，树林茂密。哥本哈根被波罗的海环抱，绿树成荫。这些城市都各有独特的风格。
    北欧四国和我国建交较早。芬兰、瑞典、丹麦三国和我国建交是在一九五○年，挪威也在一九五四年和我国建交。瑞典内政大臣鲁纳·约翰逊，芬兰工商部长韦赫摩，丹麦商业大臣任生和前挪威工业大臣特拉斯蒂，于一九六二年、一九六三年和一九六五年，先后来我国访问。一九六五年六月和七月，我国政府经济贸易代表团分别访问了瑞典、丹麦、挪威，同年九月访问了芬兰。一九六一年以来，我国和北欧四国之间，农业、工业、文化、医学、作家、青年、体育等代表团的互相往来，也是比较多的。几年来的友好往来，增进了我国和北欧四国人民之间的了解和友谊。
    每到一国，我们代表团都受到友好的接待。芬兰、瑞典、丹麦三国的外交部长（大臣）挪威的文教大臣分别接见我代表团，作了亲切的交谈。芬兰、挪威、丹麦三国的工商部长（大臣）都曾分别接见我代表团，并设宴欢迎。其他负责外交、财经、贸易、文教等方面的官员，和我代表团都有接触，介绍情况，解答问题。
          森林之国的财富
    我们作为东道国外交部的客人，安排去全国各地参观访问。所到之处，我们都受到热情友好的接待，看到我们感兴趣的事物。
    北欧的森林给人留下深刻的印象。芬兰、瑞典都是森林资源丰富的国家，瑞典的森林覆被率百分之五十二，芬兰则达到百分之七十一。当我们在芬兰库必奥参观林业学校时，主人领我们上林子里看过。山并不高，林子却很深。松树茎干笔直而高大，是这里的主要树种。枝叶塔形的针枞树，白色树干的桦树，都长得挺拔有劲。我们看过的森林工业企业不多，只看了坦佩雷的一家纸板厂和库必奥的一家木制工厂，但我们从芬兰有关部门得知，芬兰的国民经济基本上决定于森林和木材；它的产品构成出口总价值的四分之三。在芬兰，森林的绝大部分属于私人所有。芬兰投入市场的百分之七十的木材，来自私人森林业主；他们既是森林业主，又是农业主。
  北欧有的国家，农业相当发达，如丹麦和瑞典。
    我们访问了瑞典的斯康耐地区，参观了属于土地丈量人所有的一个庄园。那里的农业工人为我们表演了农业机械的操作。瑞典的工人和农民所创造的现代化农业机械，如切草机、收割机或自动挤奶器，效率都较高。斯康耐地区土壤肥沃，被称为“瑞典的面包篮”。这些勤劳的人民创造了
  “面包”，当然，“面包”是如何分配的，那是另外一回事。我们参观了斯康耐奶品厂和斯康耐肉类加工厂，都有现代化设备。据陪同参观的负责人介绍，在马尔默胡斯省东部地区销售的黄油中，斯康耐奶品厂的产品占百分之二十。
    我们在丹麦的奥尔胡斯，也参观了一个奶品厂，它是以制造奶酪闻名的。
            城市工厂所见
    我们在北欧一个月，跑得最多的是城市，看得最多的还是工业。
    我们到过瑞典最北部的一个城市——基律纳。它位于北极圈以北一百三十二公里。在那里，参观了一个很大的铁矿，它的年产量是一千五百万吨。坐上一辆旅行车，开进矿井的巷道口。矿内巷道宽阔，柏油路面，坡度不大于一比九，通往各个水平工作面。我们在负一百多米处看了矿工食堂，在负二百多米处看了工人操纵山霸二二式双钻杆顶钻车的作业。这种钻车是我们曾去访问的瑞典阿特拉斯风动工具厂的产品。我们还参观了矿井最底层的运转调度室。从井下负四百米乘车返回地面，巷道总长三十五公里，象是一座庞大的地下城市。
    我们在挪威的海尔岛访问了挪威水电公司的化肥厂。在那里，我们看到准备运往我国的尿素。这个公司和我国的贸易开始于十年前。以尿素为例，一九五六年向我国出口一千吨，一九五八年增至三千吨，到了一九六四年增加到二万七千吨。总的趋势正在增长。公司负责人和我们谈起中挪两国的贸易，表现出浓厚的兴趣。
    我们在丹麦一连参观了三个不同类型的制造冷藏设备的工厂。阿特拉斯冷冻机厂制造海水制冰设备，制造冷冻干燥成套设备，还制造屠宰设备。格兰姆兄弟冷藏机公司制造家庭用的电冰箱，制造商业用的大型冷藏设备，也制造适用运输的冷藏车辆。丹福斯工厂主要制造冷冻系统自动控制的部件和元件，而不制造成套的冰冻设备。它以制造冷冻控制元件为基础，发展控制各种温度、各种冷热源以及电气和液压等控制元件。我们参观了这三个厂的生产车间，看了他们的产品陈列室。丹麦是个畜牧业加工生产相当发达的国家，有大量肉类、奶品、禽蛋出口，所以对制冷工业非常重视。从我们参观所见，丹麦的制冷技术在食品的加工、贮藏、运输、销售以及家庭消费等环节上，都得到较普遍的应用。
    参观工业的大单位还有丹麦哥本哈根的勃梅斯特·维恩造船厂和挪威卑尔根造船厂。勃梅斯特·维恩造船厂近年来曾生产五万七千吨的货轮，它采用在预制车间里生产船体块，送进船坞进行总组装的方式。这个造船厂还生产船用柴油机，年产大型船用柴油机约三十五万马力，其能力是可观的。卑尔根造船厂能建造三万七千吨排水量的船只。我们曾登上一艘新造的两万吨货轮，观看舱内设备。我们参观了引擎制造车间，据介绍，它从一九四五年之后，开始生产自己设计的两种系列的柴油机。
    在易卜生和安徒生故居
    我们在北欧访问期间，曾在各国参观了一些宫殿、古迹和文物，挪威的易卜生故居和丹麦的安徒生博物馆引起我们浓厚的兴趣。
    易卜生故居在斯基恩城的万斯托普农庄。这是他父亲的一所别墅。他家破产后，全家迁来住在此处。易卜生写了很多著名的剧本，塑造了形形色色的资产阶级人物形象，当然，易卜生有他的时代局限性。他的名剧《野鸭》是直接以这所房子为背景创作的。我们参观了当年易卜生的起居室、从事写作的房间，看到他的部分手稿和他周围人物的照片。在一个房间里，挂满中国青年艺术剧院一九五六年七月演出《娜拉》的剧照，那次演出是北京为了纪念易卜生逝世五十周年举行的。在剧照中，有挪威著名女导演盖达琳夫人和全体演员的合影，她是应邀担任《娜拉》的艺术顾问前往北京的。这套剧照象征着中挪两国人民的友谊。
    安徒生博物馆在丹麦菲英岛中心的奥登斯。博物馆负责人对我们代表团表示热忱欢迎。他指着小圆厅墙上的彩色壁画，向我们介绍安徒生的生平。安徒生虽然是丹麦作家，我们中国人都很熟悉他。他的童话寓意深刻，可以看到封建统治阶级的残暴和愚蠢可笑；可以看到人民群众的勤劳和智慧，但是过着悲惨的生活。凡是读过安徒生的童话的人，都会留下深刻的印象。我们很有兴趣地走遍博物馆的每个陈列室。进门左侧的第一个矮小房间，是一八○五年四月二日安徒生诞生的地方。博物馆里有安徒生的很多手稿和各个时期的、世界各地出版的安徒生作品的版本。其中有我们中国出版的十几种版本，显然这仅仅是我国出版安徒生童话的很少一部分。这里陈列的画和雕塑，有的十分动人。
    在北欧访问期间，我们接触较多的，应该算是新闻界的朋友们。每到一国，外交部新闻司总要为我们代表团组织一次与新闻界朋友的会见；我国大使馆为我代表团举行招待会，出席的客人主要是新闻界知名人士。我们所到城市，访问过不少报社和广播电台，也接受当地记者的采访。我们和北欧的同行，作了友好而坦率的交谈。对大家感兴趣的国际问题，我们阐述了我们的观点。从对方所提问题的情况看来，北欧四国新闻界朋友对新中国有着极大的兴趣，希望了解我国各个方面的情况。所以，从各个方面进行友好交往，坦率地各抒己见，对增进彼此的了解，对增进中国和北欧四国人民之间的友谊，无疑是适宜的和有益的。
    我们感谢北欧四国政府的邀请，有机会在北欧作为期一月的参观访问。北欧秀丽的风光，勤劳的人民，好客的传统和我们所到之处都受到友好的接待，给我们留下深刻的印象。
