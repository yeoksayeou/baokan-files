    Editor's Note: Class teachers in schools bear extremely important responsibilities in conducting ideological and political work on students and cultivating revolutionary successors. The work of a class teacher is to emphasize politics and educate the new generation with Mao Zedong Thought. Good class teachers can play the role of revolutionary guides, and are also the backbone force in driving other teachers to realize revolutionization.
    Yang Zhizhou's article summarizes his years of experience in working as a class teacher. His experience tells us that to be a good class teacher, one must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, be able to both teach and nurture people, be able to teach by both words and deeds, revolutionize oneself, and guide students to take the path of revolutionization.
    The experiences mentioned in Comrade Yang Zhizhou's article are not only suitable for the work of class teachers, but also suitable for ideological and political work of the Party and the Communist Youth League, and can be used as a reference.
    I used to be a primary school teacher in the countryside. In 1952, the Party sent me to study at a normal college, and in 1953 I was assigned to work at Harbin No. 12 Middle School. I have successively served as a class teacher for seven classes and sent off batches of junior high school graduates. Among the graduates, those who participated in agricultural production have taken root in the countryside and become active members in building a new socialist countryside; those in other positions have been rated as advanced workers, outstanding teachers, "Five-Good" soldiers, etc.; and many who have entered higher-level schools have become "Three-Good" students or outstanding students. During this work process, I deeply realized that the work of a class teacher is an important ideological and political work, which has a significant effect on cultivating strong revolutionary successors. When I first started working as a class teacher, my work direction was not very clear, I did not have many methods, and I encountered many difficulties. Thanks to the Party's kind teachings and the enthusiastic help of comrades, the work gradually found some ways and gradually made some progress.
      Comprehensively and correctly understanding students is the foundation for educating them
    When I first started working as a class teacher, I ran into problems in my work because I did not understand the students comprehensively and deeply enough. The moral evaluations I gave to the students were not accepted by them, and they wanted me to explain exactly where they were wrong, but I couldn't answer. From this, I gradually realized that teachers can only educate students with communist ideology if they comprehensively and deeply understand them. Therefore, in my work as a class teacher, I regard comprehensively understanding students as the foundation for educating them.
    In recent years, every time I take over a new class, I have carefully studied the students' relevant materials and interviewed the previous class teacher to understand the students' situation in all aspects. For some students, I also conduct home visits. The work of understanding students should be as detailed as possible, and even small things should not be overlooked. For example, the order of a student in their siblings may seem unimportant, but it often involves their position in the family, which has a certain connection with the student's ideological and moral growth and is very useful for analyzing students' thoughts.
    I deeply understand students through extensive contact with them. Usually, I try to create conditions to have more contact with students. For example, I participate in students' labor and various activities, and even when walking to and from work, I try to be with students. In this way, I can promptly grasp the students' ideological dynamics from their words, expressions, behaviors, and actions. One day, Chen Guizhi came to school earliest, and her eyes were a little red. I found that she did not bring a lunch box or go home for lunch at noon. After understanding, it turned out that her stepfather did not allow her to bring lunch. So I persuaded her stepfather and solved the problem.
    To understand students, we must use the method of class analysis and the viewpoint of dividing one into two, not only to see the students' strengths but also to see their weaknesses, and we should see the essence through the phenomena, so as to educate them purposefully.
    In elementary school, Liu Yumin's evaluation not only did not mention any advantages, but also had a record of "This student was detained for five days by the public security department for stealing railroad spikes" (later found to be a mistake by the public security department). I visited his elementary school class teacher, and the situation was said to be more serious than the evaluation. Not long after entering school, some subject teachers reported that he often disrupted classroom order, and some even proposed "If Liu Yumin is there, I won't come to your class," etc. Through several home visits, I learned that Liu Yumin's family were poor farmers who "carried a carrying pole to the Northeast" and had endured hardship and been bullied in the old society. His family had deep feelings for the new society and also trusted the school. His mother said, "We are illiterate and don't know how to educate children. We have handed him over to the school." I also found that Liu Yumin loves labor and can respond to the school's call; he is willing to use his brain in learning and has a broad mindset; he also dares to expose his thoughts and says whatever he has in mind. Based on these situations, what kind of student is Liu Yumin after all? After thinking about it, I don't think he can be considered a bad student. Because he is good in terms of political ideology, he also works hard in learning, but there are some problems in discipline. I reported this view to the Party branch, and the organization agreed with my opinion and instructed me to understand the reasons why Liu Yumin did not abide by discipline. After another period of observation and understanding, I found the reason. It turned out that Liu Yumin was upright, stubborn, and serious about things. If he thought that the teacher was wrong, he would put forward his own opinions. He was mentally acute and could put forward questions that ordinary students could not think of, and he would ask the teacher if he had any questions, often embarrassing the teacher. For these reasons, the teacher thought he was naughty, not accepting education, and not abiding by discipline. In addition, he spoke in a rough voice and liked to argue, so the teacher thought he was impolite and confronted the teacher, resulting in a confrontational mood after only criticism. After clarifying these situations, I had more confidence in educating Liu Yumin. After half a year, I started by enlightening Liu Yumin's class consciousness, and through activities together, individual heart-to-heart talks, and appropriate praise and criticism, I improved the relationship between Liu Yumin and the teacher, and finally made Liu Yumin a very good student. He joined the Communist Youth League in the second year of junior high school, and gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party after being promoted to high school in this school. He then went on to study at a military school and still maintains regular contact with me.
        Class education is the core of ideological and political education
    Class education is the core of ideological and political education. I gradually became clear about this point in the course of my work. In the first few years of working as a class teacher, influenced by foreign educators, I did not recognize the important significance of class education in cultivating future generations. Later, after the Party's education, especially after studying the Communiqué of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, my understanding was greatly improved, and my guiding ideology for work became clearer.
    The students I teach are all between the ages of thirteen and seventeen and grew up after liberation. Although more than 80% of them are children of working people, they have lived a relatively happy life since they can remember. They have no experience of the class oppression and class exploitation suffered by the working people in the old society. They don't know much about what is class and what is revolution. I think, if the Party requires us to cultivate students into strong revolutionary successors, but students' minds do not have the class and revolutionary viewpoints of the proletariat, how can it work? But how to do it? My mind is still very unclear. So I studied the relevant articles in Chairman Mao's works, especially the article "On the Great Victory in the Northwest and on the New-Type Movement for Rectifying the Army," which greatly enlightened me. Chairman Mao said: "The victory has been so marked because of many reasons… but the most notable is that during the two-month winter period, a new-type movement for rectifying the army was carried out using the methods of speaking out about sufferings and of the 'three check-ups'." I also thought of the fact that many transferred soldiers had said that after the newly recruited soldiers and the liberated Kuomintang soldiers spoke out about their sufferings, they would not be afraid of anything and would pick up their guns to fight the enemy resolutely. This made me realize that to establish the students' class viewpoint, we should use living teaching materials such as the history of blood and tears of the working people and the history of revolutionary struggle to educate the students. The Party branch actively supported my idea. Since 1960, I have invited "three olds" (old revolutionary veterans, old workers, old peasants) to give reports to the students, which has achieved a certain educational effect.
    According to my experience, to carry out class education for junior high school students, we should mainly solve the following three problems: first, to make students understand what is class, exploitation, and revolution from the sharp contrast between the old and new societies; second, to make students understand that class and class struggle still exist today, and they must make themselves revolutionaries and carry out the revolution to the end; third, to make students understand that imperialism, reactionaries in various countries, and modern revisionism exist in the world, and two-thirds of the people have not been liberated and are still being exploited and oppressed, and we must support the revolutionary struggles of the world's working people.
    When I carry out class education for students, I focus on using concrete facts and various forms to carry out education, based on the characteristics of students being young and lacking perceptual knowledge of class struggle. First, organize students and students' parents to talk about family history and guide students to understand past class oppression and class exploitation. While telling family history, I also organized a small exhibition of comparisons between the past and the present. Many students realized that their fathers and brothers suffered in the old society, and forgetting the past means betrayal. Second, invite "three olds" to talk about "three histories." From the revolutionary predecessors, students learned the spirit of revolutionary hard bones; from the deeds of labor models, they learned how the working class, as masters of the house, are building the motherland with a high sense of responsibility and selfless spirit of labor. Third, organize students to participate in the current class struggle and guide students to understand the current class struggle. In conjunction with going to the countryside for labor, ask rural cadres to talk about the situation of rural class struggle, and send students to participate in the rural socialist education movement. The students said: "When classes still exist, we must always be vigilant to prevent the restoration conspiracy of class enemies." Fourth, organize students to watch revolutionary movies and dramas, and tell revolutionary stories, using artistic forms to carry out class education for students. Use class meetings and team activities to let students discuss the content of movies or dramas and draw positive content from them. Some students were fascinated by old novels. In order to reverse this situation, we started a
 "Red Book Corner," bringing together revolutionary literary and artistic books in the hands of students, letting students read revolutionary novels and tell revolutionary stories. Fifth, study major domestic and international events in newspapers and magazines.
    I feel in practice that class education is really effective as soon as it is grasped, and many students have quickly overcome shortcomings in morality and discipline because of class education. This makes me realize that in the ideological and political education of students, we must firmly grasp the weapon of class education, and we cannot simply talk about morality and discipline in terms of students' morality and discipline, let alone regard morality and discipline as the only content of ideological and political education and the highest standard for educating students. In my class education work, because I changed the past practice of only grasping morality and discipline and grasped this fundamental issue, I effectively improved students' class consciousness.
          Strengthen labor education and cultivate labor habits
    In 1958, the Party Central Committee announced the policy of education serving the politics of the proletariat and combining education with productive labor. Under the leadership of the Party branch, I studied the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and actively carried out labor education, organizing students to participate in physical labor.
    From the beginning, the Party organization taught us to take improving political and ideological consciousness as the fundamental purpose of organizing student labor. In order to achieve the purpose of educating students, I focused on understanding some of the students' views on labor. From the survey of several sessions of students, I learned that the idea of ​​despising physical labor is relatively common among students. Parents from exploiting classes always encourage their children to go to school and become famous and successful. While giving students correct education, some parents from working people often bring some wrong ideological influences to the students, such as thinking that "physical labor is too hard," "studying can avoid being tired," "wrestling with soil is not promising," and so on. I think that to change students' incorrect views on labor, we must organize students to participate in physical labor and transform their thinking and cultivate labor habits in labor practice. Over the years, I have insisted on organizing students to participate in labor, mainly agricultural production. Because urban students despise physical labor, the most important thing is to despise agricultural labor. Our class students go to the countryside every year during the busy farming season to participate in productive labor, and also opened a small farm in the school. A series of farm work from land preparation, manure delivery to hoeing and even autumn harvest are all done by the students themselves, cultivating students' interest in agricultural production and changing their views on agricultural production. We organize students to participate in labor, and try to make it diverse. In addition to the above-mentioned agricultural labor, we also engage in some service-oriented labor, such as organizing students to repair desks and chairs, dismantle and wash clothes, whitewash walls, and get haircuts.
    I found that students have a dislike for some dirty work. I think that to establish a labor viewpoint, we must not only make students unafraid of being tired, but also not afraid of being dirty. After asking for instructions and agreeing with the leadership, I appropriately arranged some relatively dirty and tiring work in the students' labor to cultivate students' labor feelings and the habit of not being afraid of being dirty.
    Simply organizing students to labor cannot establish students' labor viewpoint, but also requires ideological education to clarify the purpose of labor. In the class, I found that students' waste of paper was very serious. In response to this situation, I organized students to participate in voluntary labor at the Xinxing Paper Mill. Afterwards, we visited the entire papermaking process and listened to their stories of running enterprises with diligence and frugality. After returning to school, we organized a class meeting with the theme of "a piece of paper." The students said: "How difficult it is for the workers to make a piece of paper. They treat even a straw and a small piece of cloth as treasures, carefully clean them up and utilize them, but we don’t know how to cherish paper. This is too inappropriate.” Some linked and checked their failure to take care of public property, and some checked their labor attitude.
    I learned in a conversation with students that students' understanding of the issue that knowledge comes from practice is very insufficient. To make students understand this point, in addition to clarifying the principles, we should also combine some specific examples in daily labor to carry out education. The students take great care of the small farm. After planting spring cabbage, they always hope that it will grow up early and always water the ground, but it doesn’t grow well. At this time, I asked them to ask the old farmer Hou from the school's farm. After looking at it, Grandpa Hou said to them: "You are not thirsty, is it okay to keep pouring water on you? Small vegetables are the same, watering them all the time will kill them." This gave the students a great inspiration. Another time, the continuous cropping eggplants rotted their roots, so I asked the graduates who participated in agricultural production, Xiu Baohua. Xiu Baohua explained the reason why the eggplant rotted its roots from the relationship between crops and soil, which gave the students a great inspiration. In addition, every time they went to the countryside, they also asked the old farmers or production team leaders to talk about relevant production knowledge, so that the students realized that "there is a lot of knowledge in production" and "the working people are the most knowledgeable."
      Pay attention to daily specific problems and strengthen ideological education in a timely manner
    The formation and development of a good idea, good style or bad idea, bad habit of students are all a process of accumulation bit by bit. Therefore, in my work as a class teacher, I pay attention to using various opportunities to educate students, help them clarify right and wrong, and continuously improve their ideological awareness and resist the erosion and influence of bourgeois ideology.
    I believe that in the ideological and political education of students, cultivating students' collectivist ideology and selfless dedication is a major issue. Therefore, in our class, as long as there are good people and good deeds who think about the collective, I will try my best to promote and support them. For example, in the past, there were three students in our class who automatically organized to not only repair desks and chairs for the class, but also help other classes repair them. Later, I introduced their deeds to each class, and formed a small story of "three little carpenters." In this way, a trend of everyone doing good deeds and doing more good deeds for the collective has gradually formed. In the process of education and commendation, I pay attention to helping students learn the good ideas of how others take care of public property, care about the collective, and pick up money and do not pocket it, and prevent students from simply imitating mechanically.
    In addition, I also pay attention to discovering problems from some of the students' daily life performances and strengthening education. I found that the students in my class only care about filling up the class's water bucket when they go to fetch boiling water, regardless of whether the students in other classes can get boiling water; I also found that when the class distributes drama tickets, the students all scramble for good seats. These phenomena seem to be some small things, but behind these phenomena is hidden a kind of individualism and departmentalism. If students do not have a correct understanding, and continue to develop, they will not be able to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective in major issues in the future. I seized these things and carried out education in a timely manner. For example, convene a team meeting with the theme of "Behind a Drama Ticket" to let students discuss how to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective. Some said: "If you don’t give in to each other for a drama ticket, how can you take on heavy responsibilities and become revolutionary successors in the future?" After the movie tickets were issued, everyone scrambled to get bad seat tickets and gave the good ones to students with poor eyesight.
    In the past few years, students graduating from my class always liked to buy mirrors, plaster statues and other items to leave as souvenirs for the class. I feel that this practice is of little significance, especially after launching revolutionary tradition education in 1960, I enlightened students to inherit the fine revolutionary traditions and inherit the ideas and styles of hard work. Since then, graduating students have to clean the classroom, whitewash the walls, and repair desks and chairs before leaving school, leaving a clean floor, white walls, and complete desks and chairs to the new class, as the best gift to their alma mater. In this way, one session affects another session, and it has become a habit and system over the years.
      Be responsible for students to the end and help students grow up healthily
    Although students have graduated, it does not mean that teachers have no responsibility for education. I believe that caring about the healthy growth of graduated students can not only enable them to better serve the cause of socialist construction, but also set an example for students in school.
    Xiu Baohua, a graduate in 1957, was the student class leader. After graduation, she resolutely asked to go to the front line of agricultural production. At that time, her mother strongly disagreed. I made many home visits and focused on explaining that participating in agricultural production is the need of the Party and the country and is a promising thing. Her mother's thinking gradually got through, and finally agreed to Xiu Baohua's request. In the first few days that Xiu Baohua and others participated in production, I led some students to support them. At that time, the countryside was busy, so we started to repair their houses, paste the shed and brush the walls. We often organize students to work in the production team where Xiu Baohua is located, on the one hand, to support and encourage Xiu Baohua and others, so that they realize that the path they are taking is correct; and also to educate students in school and prepare them for participating in agricultural production in the future. When Xiu Baohua made achievements and was rated as a "March 8th" Red Banner Bearer, I promoted her deeds among the students. During school celebrations and festivals, I invited these students who participated in agricultural production to return to the class to talk about their labor, and introduced to the students in school their ideological struggle process of participating in agricultural production and how to overcome various difficulties, which is of great educational and encouraging effect on the graduating students.
    In 1964, Liu Mingxiu, a student in my class, participated in agricultural production at Zhao Guang Farm. Not long after arriving there, some relatives wrote to her several times to persuade her to come back, saying that they had found a job for her in the city. Liu Mingxiu was also somewhat shaken at the time and wrote to ask for my opinion. I gave her a reply in a timely manner, telling her: "We must persist in the revolution to the end. In our country, there are only people who have no future, and there are no jobs that have no future. Different jobs are just different divisions of labor. As long as you listen to the Party and serve the people wholeheartedly, you are a person with a future and a noble person." Then I also wrote to the Party organization of the farm, reflecting Liu Mingxiu's situation. Later, under the care, education and help of the Party organization, she changed quickly and made certain achievements. Some students participate in agricultural production, and their parents miss them very much after they leave, which often affects the students' emotions. I often go to visit the homes of some students who participate in agricultural production. Wang Enyu went to Zhao Guang Farm after graduation, and his mother missed him very much after he left. Knowing this situation, I took the students to visit and comfort her several times, and explained to her the important significance of students participating in agricultural production. Later, Wang Enyu's mother said with emotion: "Seeing you is like seeing a relative. I am relieved of everything. You are still so concerned about Enyu after he is gone. I have to write to tell him to work hard there and not disappoint the teacher's intentions." When Wang Enyu heard that the teacher and students often went to visit his mother, he worked even harder there.
    It is precisely because I have a relatively close relationship with the students, so I have a relatively deep revolutionary friendship with the students. Students can also often come to me to discuss their problems. Some students also came to me to talk about their career aspirations when they graduated from university.
    Overcome the authoritarian thinking of teachers and correctly handle the relationship between teachers and students
    In the past, when I was a class teacher in the third grade of junior high school, the relationship between teachers and students was handled relatively well, and the feelings with the students were harmonious. After the students graduated, they maintained close contact with me. I thought I had no problems in this regard. However, after taking over a new class of first grade students in junior high school in 1964, I gained a new understanding of how to handle the relationship between teachers and students well from some problems encountered. Once, Zhao Zhenguo and several classmates were playing table tennis. Several teachers went and wanted to occupy the table and let the students go to another table to play. As soon as the teacher said it, all the other students left, but Zhao Zhenguo would not let it go. The teacher felt embarrassed and came to me. After hearing this, I found him and criticized him, but he was very unconvinced and said to me with confidence: "You can't use being a teacher to put pressure on people. I won't accept it if you don't reason with me." After hitting a snag, I repeatedly considered where the problem was in handling this problem. The student's attitude towards the teacher was not good at the time, which was wrong, but the student's opinion was reasonable. The student was playing, and the teacher forced the student to leave, which was also wrong. I didn't seriously consider the right and wrong at the time, so I criticized him, and he would be unconvinced. This student believes that he is right and must insist, which is precisely the positive factor that we should support. Using the teacher's authority to subdue the students will frustrate the students' enthusiasm to dare to uphold the truth. I told my views to the teachers, and they also agreed with my views, thinking that the teacher should be responsible for this issue. So we exchanged opinions with Zhao Zhenguo and conducted self-criticism. Zhao Zhenguo saw that the teacher could take the initiative to check himself, and his attitude was also sincere, so he consciously checked that he was not respectful enough to the teacher. I told the whole class about this incident, affirmed Zhao Zhenguo's spirit of daring to insist on his opinions and daring to criticize the teacher, and also pointed out his shortcomings in being disrespectful to the teacher. Seeing that the teacher was so realistic, the student was convinced.
    These things made me feel that the teacher's authoritarian thinking is still making trouble in my mind. If the teacher's authoritarian thinking is not eliminated and the teacher does not completely put down his airs, a correct teacher-student relationship cannot be established. If students think they are right, they dare to say, dare to do, and dare to criticize, which is a good phenomenon. If teachers only adopt simple methods of suppression to treat students, they will frustrate their initiative. Over time, they will not dare to expose their thoughts and opinions, dare not face up to mistakes, and dare not insist on doing the right thing, and become a docile, timid and fearful person. This is contrary to the requirements of cultivating strong revolutionary successors.
    Since then, when dealing with student problems, I have paid more attention to overcoming the teacher's authoritarian thinking, paying attention to letting students fully express their opinions, and inspiring students' consciousness. During the centralized labor in the autumn of 1964, our class carried sand. In order to ensure the safety of the students on the way and not to make the labor excessive, I organized the students into groups of three or five to facilitate mutual care. Liu Jinghua insisted on acting alone. After I found out, I criticized him and asked him to act with the group. He thought that it was okay to carry sand anyway, why should he have to walk with the group! Therefore, he not only did not listen to me, but instead dumped the sand on the ground in a fit of pique and ran home. At this time, many students surrounded and watched, and everyone said something. Some said: "Teacher, let's grab him back and criticize him severely." At that time, I also felt very embarrassed in such an occasion, and I was very contradictory in my heart. But later I calmed down and put my personal face and the teacher's dignity behind me, and did not agree to let the students pull him back. At that time, I suppressed my anger, thinking that I should inspire him to consciously recognize his mistakes from a positive perspective, so I sent students to his home to talk to him, let him think about what was wrong with him. At the same time, I let the students tell him that the teacher believed that he could recognize his mistakes. When I was carrying sand in the afternoon, I kept thinking about how to solve this problem. Suddenly I found Liu Jinghua carrying two schoolbags tightly following behind me. I was very happy and asked him with a smile: "Why are you carrying two schoolbags?" He said: "Teacher! I was wrong in the morning. I contradicted the teacher, and the teacher still cares about me very much and let the students visit me. I didn't carry it in the morning, so I should carry double in the afternoon." I said: "Don't carry it with two schoolbags, don't tire yourself out. It's good that you can recognize your shortcomings and correct your mistakes." The whole afternoon, he acted with the group and worked very hard. In order to further educate him, I consciously led him to the place where the sand was thrown. When we walked to this place, he said to me: "Teacher, this pile of sand was thrown away by me, let me carry it back this time as a souvenir!" I agreed to his request. This incident was very profound for Liu Jinghua's education. Since then, he has been able to consciously abide by discipline, his organizational concept has been enhanced, and he has become more loving to the collective and respectful to the teacher.
    Through practice, I have become increasingly aware that the relationship between teachers and students should be a democratic and equal relationship. In order to better educate students, teachers should pay attention to establishing prestige among students, but it does not mean using authority to oppress people. Therefore, when dealing with student problems, we must overcome the teacher's authoritarian thinking, and not be self-righteous. We must often think about whether we have any shortcomings. We must consider the problem from the actual situation of the students in everything. Only in this way can we handle the relationship between teachers and students well, and can it be conducive to the lively and active development of students.
        Set an example by one's own conduct, pay attention to both verbal instruction and even more to personal example
    In the past, I sometimes got angry with students, and students criticized me and said: "The teacher taught us to be calm when we encounter problems, but you get angry with us yourself." Some students also said to me: "Teacher, we are silently learning from your every move, and we hope that you will set an example for us in all aspects." These words made me realize that teachers should pay attention to verbal instruction, and even more attention to personal example.
    In daily life, I always do what I ask the students to do myself first. In 1958, according to work needs, I changed from teaching geography to teaching political class. This was indeed more difficult for me. What to do? At that time, I thought, since I often educate students to be unafraid of difficulties and dare to overcome difficulties, why can't I do this myself? So, since 1959, I have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, and by applying them in a lively manner, I have strived to transform my thinking and continuously improve my political consciousness, theoretical level and work ability. In order to improve teaching, I listened to political classes in 26 middle schools and learned from their teaching experience. When organizing students to work, I worked with the students, and I went down to the dung pit first to take out the toilet, and I reached out first to wash the oil cloth for wiping the machine. Every time I accept a new class, I often get up early on the first day of school and clean the classroom spotlessly, leaving a good impression on the new students.
    Once, I agreed with the student cadres to hold a cadre meeting after school. Because I went to another school to listen to the class and came back very late, I did not return to school, and asked the students to wait in vain for a while. Afterwards, I sincerely made a self-criticism among all the students, criticizing myself for the shortcomings of not keeping the appointment. Another time, due to my negligence, the students took more sawdust for wiping the floor, causing waste. I also made a timely check to clarify the adverse effects of such things on the students. The reason why I dare to review my problems in front of the students is because I was influenced by other teachers. Once, a math teacher made a mistake in class and publicly made a review to the students, which gave me great inspiration. More importantly, the Party constantly educates us to carry out criticism and self-criticism. So when my actions have an adverse effect on the students, I make a public review. These things have a great impact on students. Wu Zhanqi, a student in my class, had a fight with a classmate and overturned the table. Afterwards, Wu Zhanqi helped up the table again and made a review. Someone asked Wu Zhanqi: What did you think when you helped up the table? He replied: "The teacher can review the shortcomings in front of everyone, how can I not admit my mistakes!"
        Use various forces and cooperate to educate students
    I feel that to train students to become strong revolutionary successors, it is not enough to rely on the education of schools and teachers alone. We should also fully mobilize the educational forces of society and families to educate students together.
    Within the school, I pay attention to cooperating with subject teachers, mobilizing and giving play to the active role of student cadres and organizations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. I often introduce the students in the class to the subject teachers. I also pay attention to constantly exchanging opinions with the subject teachers to unify the requirements and achieve consistent steps. And I also educate students to correctly treat the critical opinions of the subject teachers. If I and the subject teachers have different views on a certain issue, we will exchange opinions in a timely manner and seek a solution, and never discuss it among the students, so as to avoid causing a negative impact. In addition, I also learned a lot of things I didn't know from the subject teachers.
    Giving play to the role of the organizations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers can be said to be an important reliance for doing a good job as a class teacher. Our class often carries out some meaningful activities in units of squadrons or squads. We have convened squadron meetings with the themes of "a piece of paper," "tears of the twelfth lunar month," "thinking about standing on the overpass," and "revolutionary story meeting." "Thinking about standing on the overpass" was when I led the students to a newly built bridge across Daowai and Taiping to do voluntary labor on the day of the squadron day. At this time, I let the students stand on the bridge and look at the prosperity of Taiping Bridge today. And I told the students about the historical situation of this area. In the old society, the north side of this bridge was the Quanhe River where the Japanese invaders killed revolutionary martyrs, and the southeast was the gambling house, bandit den, and so-called "ideological criminals" and "national affairs criminals" of the traitor and bully Li Jiupeng. Later, the squadron meeting was held, so that students received a more profound education.
    In addition to school education, I also attach importance to mobilizing social forces to educate students. Our class maintains close contact with the "three olds" and has formed a system. Revolutionary veteran Grandma Lin has become the off-campus tutor of our class. Once, a squad went to visit Grandma Lin. As soon as the team members entered the yard, they saw Grandma Lin working in the vegetable garden. A student said: "Grandma Lin is still working at such an old age?" After hearing this, Grandma Lin said earnestly: "Labor can make people not forget their roots. Only by participating in labor often will they not produce bourgeois ideas." We also maintain contact with some hero models. The heroic deeds of these characters play an important role in forming students' communist ideological and moral character, enhancing revolutionary will and overcoming the tenacity of difficulties, and so on.
    In addition, it is also very important to closely contact parents and help parents correctly educate their children. Some parents have deep bitterness and high awareness, so I organize students to visit or invite them to the school to make reports. In order to enable parents to educate their children with correct ideas, I also adopt the method of parents educating parents, and specifically hold parent discussion meetings or report meetings on a certain issue. For example, in response to the idea of ​​some parents doting on their children, I invited Li Guilan's father (an old railway worker) to introduce his experience of educating his children with the revolutionary tradition of hard work and frugality of the working class. This approach is very popular among parents. Many people have learned some good ways to educate their children from it. More importantly, they have further improved their ideological understanding and clarified the great significance of educating their children to become revolutionary successors.
    Over the years, I have deeply felt that only by earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies and resolutely acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies can the work have a clear direction and can I do a good job in the work I am responsible for.

    突出政治，做好班主任的工作
    哈尔滨市第十二中学教师　杨治周
    编者按：学校里的班主任，在对学生进行思想政治工作、培养革命接班人方面，担负着十分重大的责任。班主任的工作，是突出政治，用毛泽东思想去教育新一代的工作。好的班主任能起革命带路人的作用，同时也是带动其他教师实现革命化的骨干力量。
    杨治周的文章，总结了他多年来做班主任工作的经验。他的经验告诉我们，要做一个好的班主任，必须认真学习毛主席著作，坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，既能教书又能教人，既能言教又能身教，自己革命化，并且引导学生走革命化的道路。
    杨治周同志文章中所讲的经验，不仅适合于班主任的工作，也适合于党和团的思想政治工作，可供参考。
    我原是个农村的小学教师。一九五二年党把我送到师范专科学校学习，一九五三年分配到哈尔滨市第十二中学工作。我先后做了七个班的班主任，送走了一批一批的初中毕业生。在毕业生中，参加农业生产的都在农村扎下了根，成了建设社会主义新农村的积极分子；在其他岗位上的，有不少人被评为先进工作者、优秀教师、“五好”战士等；升入高一级学校的也有不少人成了“三好”学生或优秀学生。在这段工作过程中，我深深地体会到班主任工作是一项重要的思想政治工作，对培养坚强的革命后代具有重大的作用。我在开始做班主任工作时，工作方向还不大明确，办法也不多，碰到很多困难。由于党的亲切教导，和同志们的热诚帮助，工作才逐步地找到一些门路，逐渐地有些进步。
      全面、正确地了解学生是教育学生的基础
    在初做班主任工作时，由于我对学生的了解不够全面深入，工作上出了问题。我给学生搞的操行评语，学生不服，要我解释他们究竟什么地方不对，而我又回答不上来。从这里我逐步认识到，教师只有全面地深刻地了解学生，才能用共产主义思想教育学生。因此，我在班主任工作中，把全面了解学生做为教育学生的基础。
    最近几年来，我每接一个新班，都要通过学生的有关材料和访问原先的班主任，详细了解学生的各方面情况。对有些学生还要进行家庭访问。了解学生的工作应该是越细越好，连小事也不要放过。比如学生在兄弟姊妹中排行第几，看来无关重要，可是它往往涉及他在家庭中所处的地位，对学生思想品德成长有一定联系，对分析学生思想也是很有用的材料。
    深入地了解学生，我是通过和学生广泛接触来进行的。平时，我尽量创造条件，多和学生接触。如学生的劳动和各种活动我都去参加，就是上下班走路，我也尽量和学生在一起。这样，我就从学生的言语表情、行为举止等方面，及时掌握学生的思想动态。有一天陈桂芝来校最早，眼睛有点发红。我发现她午间既未带饭盒，也不回家吃饭。经过了解，原来是她的继父不准她带午饭。于是我就对她的继父做了说服工作，解决了这个问题。
    了解学生，必须运用阶级分析的方法和一分为二的观点，既要看到学生的优点，又要看到学生的缺点，并且应该通过现象看到本质，以便有的放矢地对他们进行教育。
    刘玉民同学在小学时，他的鉴定上不但没有提出一点优点，而且还有“该生因偷铁道钉被公安部门拘留五天”的一段记载（以后查明是公安部门搞错了）。我访问他小学时的班主任，情况说得比鉴定还严重。入学不久，有些科任教师反映他经常扰乱课堂秩序，有的甚至提出“有刘玉民，我就不到你的班上课”，等等。我通过几次家庭访问，了解到：刘玉民家是“一扁担挑到东北”来的贫苦农民，在旧社会饱经风霜，受尽欺凌。他一家人对新社会有着深厚的感情，也很信赖学校。他母亲说：“我们不认字，也不会教育孩子，我们把他交给学校了。”我又发现，刘玉民爱劳动，能响应学校的号召；在学习上肯动脑筋，思路很广；也敢于暴露思想，心里有啥嘴就说啥。根据这些情况，刘玉民到底算个什么样的学生呢？想来想去，我觉得他不能算个坏学生。因为他在政治思想方面是好的，学习也是努力的，只是在纪律上有些问题。我向党支部汇报了这种看法，组织上同意我的意见，指示我了解刘玉民不遵守纪律的原因。又经过一个时期的观察了解，我找到了这个原因。原来刘玉民耿直、倔强，对事认真，他认为老师说的不对，就提出自己的意见，他思想敏锐，能够提出一般同学想不到的问题，而且有问题就问老师，常常问得老师发窘。由于这些原因，老师认为他调皮、不接受教育、不遵守纪律。再加他说话粗声粗气，好争辩问题，老师就认为他没有礼貌、顶撞老师，结果对他只是一味批评，造成了对立情绪。弄清了这些情况，教育刘玉民的信心更足了。经过半年的时间，我从启发刘玉民的阶级觉悟入手，通过一起活动，个别谈心，恰如其分地表扬和批评，改进了刘玉民和老师的关系，终于使刘玉民成了一个很好的学生。他在初中二年级时入了团，升入本校高中后光荣地加入了中国共产党。他以后又升入了军事学校深造，至今和我保持着经常的通讯联系。
        阶级教育是思想政治教育的核心
    阶级教育是思想政治教育的核心。对于这一点，我是在工作过程中逐渐明确起来的。在最初做班主任的几年，因受外国教育学家的影响，以致不认识阶级教育对培养后代的重要意义。以后经过党的教育，特别是学习党的八届十中全会公报以后，认识才有了较大的提高，工作指导思想更明确了。
    我教的学生，年龄都在十三岁到十七岁之间，是解放以后长大的。虽然他们百分之八十以上的人是劳动人民的子女，但从记事以来就生活得比较美满。他们对旧社会劳动人民遭受的阶级压迫和阶级剥削，根本没有体验。对于什么是阶级、什么是革命也不大懂得。我想，党要求我们把学生培养成坚强的革命接班人，学生的思想里没有无产阶级的阶级观点和革命观点，那怎么能行呢？但是怎么办？思想里还很不清楚。于是我就学习毛主席著作中的有关文章，特别学了《评西北大捷兼论解放军的新式整军运动》一文，使我受到了很大的启发。毛主席说：“此次胜利如此显著，原因甚多……但是最值得注意的，是在冬季两个多月中用诉苦和三查方法进行了新式的整军运动。”我又联想到，许多部队转业同志讲过，新参军的战士和被解放了的国民党士兵经过诉苦之后，就会天不怕地不怕，拿起枪杆坚决去打敌人。这使我认识到，要树立学生的阶级观点，应当用劳动人民的血泪史、革命斗争史等活教材，向学生进行教育。党支部积极支持了我的想法，从一九六○年以来，我就邀请“三老”（老革命前辈、老工人、老农民）给学生作报告，收到了一定的教育效果。
    根据我的体会，向初中学生进行阶级教育，主要应解决以下三个问题：第一是使学生从新旧社会的鲜明对比中了解到什么是阶级、剥削和革命；第二是使学生了解到现在还存在阶级和阶级斗争，必须使自己成为一个革命者，把革命进行到底；第三是使学生了解世界上存在帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义，还有三分之二的人没有解放，还在那里受剥削和压迫，我们必须支援世界劳动人民的革命斗争。
    我向学生进行阶级教育，根据学生年龄小、缺乏阶级斗争感性知识的特点，着重用一些具体事实，通过多种形式来进行。一、组织学生和学生家长讲家史，引导学生认识过去的阶级压迫和阶级剥削。在讲家史的同时，我还组织了小型今昔对比展览会。许多学生认识到，自己的父兄在旧社会受苦受难，如果忘记了过去，就意味着背叛。二、请“三老”讲“三史”。学生从革命前辈的身上，学到了革命的硬骨头精神；从劳动模范的事迹中了解到当家做主的工人阶级是怎样以高度的责任感和忘我的劳动精神去建设祖国的。三、组织学生参加当前的阶级斗争，引导学生认识当前的阶级斗争。结合下乡劳动请农村干部讲农村阶级斗争的情况，派学生参加农村的社会主义教育运动。学生们说：“在阶级还存在的时候，必须时刻提高警惕，防止阶级敌人的复辟阴谋。四、组织学生看革命电影、戏剧，讲革命的故事，用艺术形式对学生进行阶级教育。利用班会和团队活动，让学生讨论电影或戏剧的内容，从中汲取积极内容。有的学生看旧小说入了迷。为了扭转这种情况，我们就搞起了
  “红色图书角”，把学生手中的革命文艺书籍集中起来，让学生读革命小说，讲革命故事。五、学习报章上的国内外大事。
    我在实践中觉得，阶级教育真是一抓就灵，许多学生由于受到阶级教育，迅速地克服了品德纪律上的缺点。这使我认识到，在学生的思想政治教育中，必须紧紧掌握阶级教育这个武器，不能就学生的品德纪律讲品德纪律，更不应该把品德纪律当作思想政治教育的唯一内容和教育学生的最高标准。我在班级教育工作中，由于改变了过去只抓品德纪律的做法，抓住了这个根本问题，就有效地提高了学生的阶级觉悟。
          加强劳动教育，培养劳动习惯
    一九五八年党中央公布了教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。在党支部的领导下，我学了中共中央和国务院的指示，就积极进行劳动教育，组织学生参加体力劳动。
    一开始，党组织就教导我们要把提高政治思想觉悟作为组织学生劳动的根本目的。为了达到教育学生的目的，我着重摸了学生对劳动的一些看法。从对几届学生的调查中，我了解到学生中轻视体力劳动的思想是比较普遍的。剥削阶级出身的家长，总是用升学和成名成家来鼓励自己的子女。有些劳动人民出身的家长在给予学生正确教育的同时，往往也带给学生一些错误的思想影响，如认为“体力劳动太苦”，“念了书可以不挨累”，“和土块摔跤没有出息”等等。我想，要改变学生对劳动的不正确看法，必须组织学生参加体力劳动，在劳动实践中改造思想，养成劳动习惯。几年来，我坚持了组织学生以参加农业生产为主的劳动。因为城市学生轻视体力劳动，最主要的是轻视农业劳动。我们班学生每年农忙季节都去农村参加生产劳动，并在校内开辟了一个小农园。由整地、送粪到铲趟以至秋收等一连串的农活都由学生自己来搞，培养学生对农业生产的兴趣，改变他们对农业生产的看法。我们组织学生参加劳动，尽量做到多种多样。除上述农业劳动外，还搞一些服务性劳动，如组织学生修理桌椅、拆洗衣服、粉刷墙壁、理发等等。
    我发现学生对一些脏活有反感。我想，树立劳动观点，不但要使学生不怕累，还得不怕脏。经过请示领导同意，在学生劳动中适当地安排了一些比较脏、累的活，培养学生的劳动感情和不怕脏的习惯。
    仅仅组织学生劳动，还不能树立学生的劳动观点，还要进行思想教育，明确劳动的目的性。在班里我发现学生糟踏纸张的现象很严重。针对这种情况，我组织学生到新兴造纸厂去参加义务劳动。事后我们参观了整个造纸的过程，听了他们勤俭办企业的事迹，回到学校之后，又组织了以“一张纸”为主题的班会，学生们说：“工人叔叔制造一张纸是多么不易，他们连一根稻草、一块小布条都当成宝贝，细心地收拾起来，加以利用，而我们却不知爱惜纸张，这太不应该了。”有的联系检查了自己不知爱护公物，有的检查了自己的劳动态度。
    我在和学生谈话中了解到，学生对知识来源于实践这个问题认识很不足。要使学生明白这一点，除了讲清道理以外，还应当结合日常劳动中的一些具体事例来进行教育。学生侍弄小农园是很用心的，他们种上了春白菜之后，总是希望它早点成长，老往地里浇水，结果长的很不好。这时，我叫他们向校农园的老农工侯老大爷去请教。侯老大爷看了之后，对他们说：“你不渴，总灌你水行不行？小菜也是一样，总浇水就灌死了。”这给学生很大的启发。还有一次种的重茬茄子烂了根，我就让学生问参加农业生产的毕业生修葆华。修葆华从农作物和土壤的关系上讲述了茄子烂根的原因，使学生受到很大启发。此外，每次下乡也都请老农或生产队长给讲述有关的生产知识，使学生认识到“生产中大有学问”，“劳动人民是最有知识的”。
      注意日常具体问题，及时加强思想教育
    学生的一种好思想、好作风或者坏思想、坏习气的形成与发展，都是经过一点一滴日积月累的过程的。因此，我在班主任工作中，注意利用各种机会向学生进行教育，帮助他们明确是非，不断地提高他们的思想觉悟，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀和影响。
    我认为，在学生的思想政治教育中，培养学生的集体主义思想、舍己为人的思想是一个大问题。因此，在我们班里，只要有为集体着想的好人好事，我就极力加以提倡和扶植。如我班过去有三个同学自动地组织起来，不但给本班修理桌椅，而且还帮助别的班修理。后来我把他们的事迹，向每届同学介绍，就形成“三个小木匠”的小故事。这样就逐步形成了人人为集体争做好事、多做好事的风气。在教育和表扬的过程中，我注意帮助学生把别人是怎样爱护公物、关心集体、拾金不昧的好思想学到手，防止学生单纯的机械的模仿。
    此外，我还注意从学生的一些日常生活表现中来发现问题，加强教育。我发现我班同学去打开水只顾灌满本班的水桶，不管别班的同学能否喝到开水；还发现班里发话剧票，同学们都争着要好座。这些现象，看来好象是一些小事，但是在这些现象的背后隐藏着的却是一种个人主义和本位主义的思想。学生如果没有正确认识，发展下去，将来在大问题上就更不能正确处理个人和集体之间的关系。我抓住这些事情，及时进行了教育。比如，召开以“一张话剧票的背后”为主题的中队会，让同学们讨论如何正确处理个人和集体的关系。有的说：“一张剧票都互不相让，将来怎么能够挑重担，做革命接班人呢？”以后发电影票，大家都争着拿不好的座票，把好的让给视力差的同学。
    前几年，我班毕业的同学毕业时总喜欢买个镜子、石膏象等物品给班级留纪念。我感到这种做法意义不大，特别是一九六○年开展了革命传统教育后，我就启发学生要继承革命的优良传统，把艰苦奋斗的思想、作风继承下来。从此，毕业学生在离开学校前，都要打扫教室、粉刷墙壁、修理桌椅，留下个干净的地板、洁白的墙壁、完整的桌椅交给新的一班，作为留给母校最好的礼物。这样一届影响一届，几年来也已经形成了习惯和制度。
      对学生负责到底，帮助学生健康地成长
    学生虽然毕业了，但是并不等于教师就没有教育的责任了。我认为，关怀毕业了的学生的健康成长，不仅可以使他们更好地为社会主义建设事业服务，而且可以给在校学生树立学习的榜样。
    一九五七年毕业生修葆华，是学生班长，她毕业后坚决要求走上农业生产第一线。当时，她母亲很不同意。我多次进行了家庭访问，着重说明参加农业生产是党和国家的需要，是大有前途的道理。她母亲的思想逐渐通了，终于同意了修葆华的要求。修葆华她们参加生产的头几天，我领着一些学生支援她们。当时农村忙，我们就动手给她们修理房子，糊棚刷墙。我们经常组织学生到修葆华所在的生产队劳动，一方面是支持鼓励修葆华等人，使她们认识自己走的道路是正确的；同时也为了教育在校的学生，为他们将来参加农业生产做准备。当修葆华做出了成绩，被评为“三八”红旗手之后，我就在学生中宣传她的事迹。每逢校庆和节日都请这些参加农业生产的学生回班讲述自己的劳动情况，向在校学生介绍自己参加农业生产的思想斗争过程和怎样克服各种困难的情况，这对应届毕业生的教育鼓舞作用是很大的。
    一九六四年，我班学生刘明秀到赵光农场参加农业生产，到了那里不久，有些亲戚几次写信劝她回来，说在城市已经给找妥了工作。刘明秀当时也有些动摇，写信来征求我的意见。我及时地给她回了信，嘱咐她说：“要坚持革命到底。在我们的国家里，只有没有出息的人，没有没出息的工作。工作不同只是分工不同而已，只要听党的话，全心全意为人民服务就是有出息的人，就是高尚的人。”接着我还给农场党组织写了信，反映了刘明秀的情况，以后她在党组织的关怀、教育和帮助下，转变很快，并做出了一定的成绩。有的学生参加了农业生产，走了以后家长很想念，这样往往会影响学生的情绪。我就经常到一些参加农业生产的同学家里去访问。王恩玉毕业后到了赵光农场，走后他母亲很想他。我知道了这个情况，曾几次领着学生去看望，安慰她，给她讲清了学生参加农业生产的重要意义。后来王恩玉的母亲感动地说：“见了你们就象见了亲人，一切我都放心啦，恩玉走了你们还这样关心，我得写信告诉他，让他在那里好好干，别辜负了老师的一片心思。”当王恩玉听说老师和同学还经常去探望他的母亲，他在那里工作就越发努力了。
    正因为我和学生关系比较密切，所以和学生有着比较深厚的革命情谊。学生有了问题也能经常找我商谈。有的学生，在大学毕业时，还来找我谈工作的志愿问题。
    破除教师的权威思想，正确处理师生关系
    过去我做初三班主任时，师生关系处理得比较好，平时和学生的感情很融洽，学生毕业后还和自己保持密切的联系。我以为自己在这方面没有什么问题了。可是，一九六四年接了初一的新班以后，从碰到的一些问题中，使自己对如何处理好师生关系有了新的认识。有一次赵振国和几个同学在打乒乓球，有几位老师去了，想占用这个球台，让学生到另外球台去玩。老师一说，别的学生都走了，唯有赵振国说什么也不让。弄得老师很下不来台，就来找我。我听到之后，就把他找来批评一顿，可是他很不服气，并对我理直气壮地说：“不能拿当老师来压人，不说理我就不服。”我碰了钉子以后，就反复考虑处理这个问题的毛病在那里？学生当时对老师的态度不好，这不对，但学生的意见却有道理，学生正在打球，教师硬让学生走，这也不对。我当时没认真考虑是非，就把他批评了一通，他就会不服气。这个学生认为自己是有理的，就要坚持，这正是我们应该扶植的积极因素。用教师的权威去压服学生，就会挫伤学生敢于坚持真理的积极性。我把自己的看法和那几位老师讲了，他们也同意我的看法，认为在这个问题上教师应负责任。于是我们和赵振国交换了意见，进行了自我批评。赵振国看老师能主动检查自己，态度也很诚恳，他也自觉地检查了对老师不够尊重。我把这件事的经过向全班同学讲了，肯定了赵振国敢于坚持意见，敢于批评老师的精神，同时也指出他对老师不够尊重的缺点。这个学生看到老师这样实事求是，也就口服心服了。
    这些事使我感到教师的权威思想仍在自己的头脑里作怪。如果教师的权威思想不破除，不彻底放下架子，正确的师生关系就建立不起来。学生认为自己对，就敢说、敢做，敢于进行批评，这是好现象。如果教师只采取简单压服的办法对待学生，就会挫伤他们的主动性。长此以往，他们就不敢暴露自己的思想观点，有错误不敢正视，做对了也不敢坚持，变成一个唯唯诺诺、胆小怕事的人。这和培养坚强的革命接班人的要求，是背道而驰的。
    从此，我在处理学生问题的时候，就更加注意克服教师的权威思想，注意让学生充分把话说出来，启发学生的自觉性。一九六四年秋季集中劳动时，我们班背沙子。我为了学生途中的安全和不使劳动过量，把学生三五个人组成一个小组，便于相互照顾。刘景华偏偏自己单独行动，我发现之后，就批评了他，让他和小组一起行动。他认为反正背沙子就行呗，何必非得和小组一起走！因此不仅没听我的话，反而一赌气把沙子倒在地上，就往家跑。这时许多同学都围着看，说什么的都有。有的说：“老师，我们把他抓回来，好好批评他一顿”。当时自己也觉得在这样一个场合很下不来台，内心里也很矛盾。但是后来还是冷静了下来，把个人的面子，教师的尊严扔在脑后，没有同意让学生把他拉回来。当时，我压住了火气，认为应从积极方面启发他自觉地认识错误，就派学生到他家去和他谈谈，让他好好想想自己有什么不对的地方。同时让学生告诉他，老师相信他是能够认识错误的。下午我在背沙子时，心里一直在想怎么解决这个问题。忽然发现刘景华拿来两个书包紧紧跟在我的身后。我很高兴，就笑着问他：“你怎么拿两个书包呢？”他说：“老师！上午是我不对了，我顶撞了老师，老师还非常关心我，让同学看望我。我上午没有背，下午我应该背双份。”我说：“不要用两个书包背了，别把你累着，你能认识缺点，改正错误，这很好。”整个下午，他和小组一起行动，而且干的很起劲儿。为了进一步教育他，我有意识地领他到扔沙子的那个地方去，当我们走到这个地方时，他对我说：“老师，这堆沙子是我扔掉的，这回我把它背回去作个纪念吧！”我答应了他的要求。这件事对刘景华的教育是很深刻的。从此，他能够自觉地遵守纪律，组织观念增强了，更加热爱集体和尊敬老师了。
    经过实践，使我越来越认识到，教师和学生的关系应该是民主平等的关系。教师为了更好地教育学生，应该注意在学生中建立威信，但并不等于要用权威压人。因此，在处理学生问题时必须破除教师的权威思想，不能自以为是，要经常想一想自己是否有不对的地方。事事都要设身处地从学生实际出发来考虑问题。只有这样，才能处理好师生关系，才能有利于学生生动活泼地主动地发展。
        以身作则，既要言教，更要注意身教
    我过去有时对学生好发火，学生批评我说：“老师教育我们遇到问题要冷静，可你自己却对我们发火。”有的学生还对我说：“老师，你的一举一动我们都在默默地学习，希望你在各方面给我们做出榜样。”这些话使我认识到教师要注意言教，更要注意身教。
    日常，凡是我要求学生做到的事情，我自己总要首先做到。一九五八年，根据工作需要，我由教地理改教政治课。这对我来说，确有较大的困难。怎么办呢？当时我想，既然自己常教育学生，要不怕困难，勇于战胜困难，为什么自己不能这样做呢？于是，我从一九五九年以来，坚持学习毛主席著作，以活学活用的办法，努力改造自己的思想，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟、理论水平和工作能力。为了改进教学，我先后听了二十六所中学的政治课，学习他们的教学经验。在组织学生劳动时，我都和学生一起干，掏厕所我先下粪坑，漂洗擦机器的油布我先伸手。每当我接受一个新班，往往在开学第一天，起大早把教室打扫得干干净净，给新生留下一个良好的印象。
    有一次，我和学生干部约定放学以后开干部会。由于我去外校听课，回来时间很晚，就没有再回校，叫学生空等了一阵。事后我在全体学生中诚恳地做了自我检讨，批评了自己不守约会的缺点。还有一次，由于我的疏忽，学生多领了擦地板的锯沫子，造成了浪费，我也及时作了检查，澄清这类事情对学生发生的不良影响。我所以敢在学生面前检讨自己的毛病，是受了其他老师的影响。有一次，一个数学老师，在课堂上算错了题，公开向学生做检讨，这给我很大的启发。更重要的，是党不断教育我们要开展批评与自我批评。所以当我的行动对学生产生不良影响时，我就公开做检讨。这些事给学生的影响很大。我班学生吴占岐和一个同学打闹，推翻了桌子。事后吴占岐又扶起了桌子，并做了检讨。别人问吴占岐：你扶桌子时是怎样想的？他回答说：“老师都能当大家面检讨缺点，我怎能不承认错误呢！”
        运用各方面力量，共同配合教育学生
    我觉得要把学生培养成为坚强的革命后代，只靠学校和教师的教育是不够的，还应当把社会和家庭的教育力量充分地调动起来，共同教育学生。
    在学校内，我注意和科任教师配合，调动和发挥学生干部和团、队组织的积极作用。我经常向科任教师介绍班级学生的情况、对缺点比较严重的学生的教育，我也注意经常和科任教师交换意见，统一要求，做到步调一致，并且教育学生正确对待科任教师的批评意见。如果我和科任教师对待某个问题有了不同的看法，就及时地交换意见，求得解决，从不在学生中间谈论，避免造成不良的影响。另外，我也从科任教师那里了解到不少我所不知道的情况。
    发挥团、队组织的作用，可以说是做好班主任工作的重要依靠。我班经常以中队或小队为单位开展一些有教育意义的活动。我们曾召开了以“一张纸”、“腊月泪”、“站在跨线桥上想一想”、“革命故事会”等内容为主题的队会。“站在跨线桥上想一想”，是过队日这天，我领着同学到新建成的横跨道外和太平的一座桥上去义务劳动。这时，我让学生站在桥上看今日太平桥的一片繁荣景象。并给学生讲了这一带的历史情况。在旧社会，这座桥的北面是日寇杀害革命烈士的圈河，东南是汉奸恶霸李九鹏榨取劳动人民血汗的赌局、土匪窝以及所谓“思想犯”、“国事犯”的“矫正院”。以后又开了中队会，使学生受到比较深刻的教育。
    除了学校的教育，我还重视调动社会力量教育学生。我们班级和“三老”保持着密切的联系，并且形成了制度。革命前辈林奶奶已成了我班校外辅导员。一次，一个小队去访问林奶奶，队员们一进院子看到林奶奶正在菜园子劳动。一个同学说：“林奶奶这么大年岁还劳动啊？”林奶奶听了，语重心长地说：“劳动可以使人不忘本，只有经常参加劳动，才不会产生资产阶级思想。”我们还和一些英雄模范人物保持着联系，这些人物的英雄事迹对形成学生的共产主义思想品德、增强革命斗志和克服困难的毅力，等等，发生着重大的作用。
    另外，同家长密切联系，帮助家长正确地教育自己的子女，也是十分重要的事情。有的家长苦大仇深，觉悟较高，我就组织学生去进行访问或把他们请到学校做报告。为了使家长能用正确思想教育子女，我还采用家长教育家长的办法，专门就某一个问题召开家长讨论会或报告会。如针对有些家长娇惯孩子的思想，我请了李桂兰的父亲（老铁路工人），介绍了他是怎样用工人阶级勤劳俭朴的革命传统教育子女的经验。这种做法很受家长们的欢迎，不少人从中学习了一些教育子女的好办法，更重要的是进一步提高了思想认识，明确了教育子女成为革命后代的重大意义。
    这些年来，我深深感到，只有认真学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，按照党的方针政策办事，工作才能有明确的方向，才能做好自己担负的工作。（附图片）
