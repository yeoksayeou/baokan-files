    Do not trust the masses, only circle around a few cadres, the work will become more and more busy. To do a good job, you must:
    Love the people Serve the people Rely on the people
    After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I felt that the gap was quite large, and the most fundamental thing was that I did not study and apply Chairman Mao's works as well as Jiao Yulu, and my idea of serving the people wholeheartedly was not as good as Jiao Yulu's. Comrade Jiao Yulu went to Lankao with Chairman Mao's books and deep class feelings. He brought his work to the grassroots level, rooted himself among the masses, trusted the masses, relied on the masses, and built a new Lankao. But we often only circle among a few cadres. In our work, we do not trust the grassroots, do not trust the masses, do not rely on the grassroots, and do not rely on the masses. In order to meet the needs, we strengthen the organization and increase the number of personnel. As a result, the more we increase, the more we feel that there are not enough personnel. Many departments are shouting that there are few people and many things. Some say, "We are too busy at the top to have time to go to the countryside!" Some say, "If I go down, I am not at ease with the work of the organization." Therefore, many people float on top and cannot go down.
    In the process of learning from Jiao Yulu, we conducted special discussions on a series of questions such as why we cannot go down, where the real work of the county party committee is, and where the leading force should be placed. Everyone realized that the main reason why we couldn't go down in the past was that the question of "serving whom" had not been resolved, and we lacked the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly like Comrade Jiao Yulu, fearing hardship and fatigue, putting on "official" airs, and unwilling to implement the "three togethers". Therefore, the focus of the work is only circling among the cadres. When it comes to busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, we take administrative methods, temporarily drawing a group of cadres from various departments to form work teams to carry out surprise activities. Some squat in communes, some squat in brigades, and run back after ten days or half a month. As a result, the grassroots work was not done well, the departments that were drawn had opinions, and there were many contradictions.
    After the comrades of the county party committee realized this problem, they decided to put the leading force into the grassroots and the masses. To take root among the grassroots masses, we must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, love the people, serve the people, and rely on the people.

    不相信群众，只在少数干部身上打圈子，工作就会越做越忙，要做好工作，必须：
    爱人民  为人民  靠人民
    学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹后，感到差距相当大，而最根本一条是活学活用毛主席著作不如焦裕禄，完全彻底为人民服务的思想不如焦裕禄。焦裕禄同志是带着毛主席的书，怀着深厚的阶级感情到兰考去的。他把工作做到基层，根子扎到群众中，相信群众，依靠群众，建设新兰考。而我们往往只在少数干部中打圈子。工作中不相信基层，不相信群众，不依靠基层，不依靠群众。我们为了满足需要，就加强机构，增加人员，结果，越增加越感到人员不够，不少部门叫喊人少，事情多，有的说，在上头都忙不过来，那有时间下乡啊！有的说：“我要下去，机关工作不放心。”因此，许多人浮在上边下不去。
    我们在学习焦裕禄的过程中，对为什么下不去，县委的真正工作在那里，领导力量应放到什么地方等一系列问题，进行专门讨论。大家认识到过去下不去的主要原因，是“为谁服务”的问题没有解决，缺乏焦裕禄同志那样全心全意为人民服务的思想，怕苦怕累，摆“官”架子，不愿实行“三同”。因此，工作的着眼点，仅在干部当中打圈圈。一到春耕、夏锄、秋收等农忙季节，就采取行政的方法，从各部门临时抽调一批干部，组成工作队，下去搞突击活动。有的蹲公社，有的蹲大队，干个十天半月就跑回来了。结果，基层工作没搞好，被抽调的部门有意见，矛盾很多。
    县委的同志认识到这个问题以后，决定把领导力量放到基层、群众中去。到基层群众中去扎根，要象焦裕禄同志那样，爱人民，为人民，靠人民。黑龙江宾县县委书记  田凤山
