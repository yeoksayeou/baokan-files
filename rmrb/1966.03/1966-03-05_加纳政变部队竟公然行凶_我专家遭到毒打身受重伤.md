    Ghana's Coup Troops Publicly Commit Atrocities  Our Experts Severely Beaten and Seriously Injured
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 4th - News: Zhou Qinwen, leader of the Chinese expert team assisting Ghana in building a textile factory, and three other Chinese staff members, were brutally beaten by Ghana's coup troops on February 27th, with some suffering serious injuries.
    Around noon on this day, Zhou Qinwen, leader of the textile factory construction expert team, Jin Zhicai, translator, Yuan Yuncong, expert, and Guo Binggang, staff member of the Chinese Embassy, were en route from Accra to the textile factory construction site by car when Ghanaian coup troops forcibly stopped their vehicle and demanded to see their identification cards. The Chinese experts pointed out that they were in Ghana to help with construction under the Sino-Ghanaian economic and technical cooperation agreement, and the Ghanaian government had not issued them any identification cards. The Ghanaian coup troops not only ignored their explanation but also subjected them to insulting body searches and brutally beat them. Subsequently, they dragged them onto a military vehicle, threatened them with bayonets, and escorted them to the police headquarters where the "National Liberation Council" headquarters was located.
    After being unreasonably escorted to the headquarters of the "National Liberation Council," the Chinese experts and staff members were subjected to even more savage beatings. Coup troops forcibly stripped the Chinese personnel of their clothing, violently beat them with whips and rifle butts, and trampled on them with leather boots, dragging them around on the ground. The Chinese experts and personnel resolutely protested this atrocity by the Ghanaian coup troops.
    The Ghanaian coup troops subjected the Chinese personnel to atrocities for an hour before sending them back to the Chinese Embassy. Hospital examinations showed that Zhou Qinwen had a fractured hip and could not stand. The other three had multiple injuries to their bodies and heads.
    Huang Shixie, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, met with responsible officials of the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry that afternoon to lodge a strong protest against this atrocity by the Ghanaian troops, and declared that China reserved the right to make further demands.
    On the morning of February 28th, the Chinese Embassy in Ghana formally submitted a note to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry, lodging a strong protest against this atrocity.

    加纳政变部队竟公然行凶  我专家遭到毒打身受重伤
    新华社四日讯　阿克拉消息：中国援助加纳建筑纺织厂的施工专家组组长周勤文和其他三名中国工作人员，二月二十七日竟然遭到加纳政变部队野蛮殴打，其中有的身受重伤。
    这一天中午十二时左右，纺织厂施工专家组组长周勤文、翻译金智才、专家袁允从和中国大使馆工作人员郭炳刚在从阿克拉乘车前往纺织厂工地途中，加纳政变部队士兵强令停车，并且要他们出示身份证。中国专家指出，他们是按照中、加两国经济技术合作协定来加纳帮助建设的，加纳政府并没有发给他们任何身份证。加纳政变部队不但不理睬他们的解释，反而对他们进行侮辱性的搜身，并且蛮横地加以殴打，接着又把他们拖上军车，用刺刀威逼押送到“全国解放委员会”总部所在的警察总局。
    中国专家和工作人员被无理押到“全国解放委员会”总部以后，遭到更野蛮的殴打。政变部队士兵强行脱光中国人员身上的衣服，用皮鞭和枪托猛烈毒打他们，并且用皮靴在中国人员身上猛踩，在地上乱拖他们。中国专家和人员坚决抗议加纳政变部队的这种暴行。
    加纳政变部队对中国人员施加暴行达一小时之久，才把他们送还中国使馆。医院检查证明，周勤文臀骨骨折，不能起立，其余三人身体和头部多处受伤。
    中国驻加纳大使馆临时代办黄世燮当天下午会见加纳外交部负责官员，对加纳部队的这一暴行提出强烈抗议，并且声明保留提出进一步要求的权利。
    二月二十八日上午，中国驻加纳大使馆向加纳外交部正式提交一份照会，对这一暴行提出强烈抗议。
