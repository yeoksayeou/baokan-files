    The First Spring
    Wang Tuoming
    Early spring still carried a bit of the lingering chill of harsh winter, but Zhang Zhenxin and Liu Changgen, who were on their way, felt as if they were carrying a brazier in their hearts, warm all over.
    Zhang Zhenxin and Liu Changgen were both workers at the county agricultural machinery repair factory, apprenticed to the same master. This morning, during the mobilization meeting at the factory, they were deeply moved by the factory director's report. The director's words still seemed to ring in their ears: "To welcome the first spring of the Third Five-Year Plan, let us respond to the Party's call, actively support the new upsurge in agriculture. The factory will organize repair teams to go to the countryside, shorten the repair time for tractors at the tractor stations, and ensure that the spring plowing and production are not delayed..." The factory originally decided that the repair team would depart early tomorrow morning, but Zhang Zhenxin and Liu Changgen couldn't wait. After lunch, they expressed their intentions to the leadership and set off with tools and necessary parts.
    They were going to the Donggang Brigade of the Nanhai Commune, about thirty to forty *li* away from the county town. There was a mechanized farming team from the county tractor station there, cultivating land for the commune. The two of them hurried along the way, and soon arrived.
    As they entered the village, they saw many people gathered at the threshing ground, talking and clamoring. What had happened? Just as they were about to go over to see, they suddenly heard someone in the crowd shout, "Da Zhang! Xiao Liu!" As the voice spoke, a tall girl squeezed out.
    Zhang Zhenxin and Liu Changgen recognized her as Xiao Chen, the captain of the first mechanized farming team of the tractor station. They quickly asked her in unison, "Xiao Chen, what's the matter?"
      "Come and have a look! We've been waiting for you!" Xiao Chen said, pulling them towards the threshing ground.
    Zhang Zhenxin and Liu Changgen strode onto the threshing ground, and immediately, both of them were dumbfounded: parked in front of them was an early imported tractor. They were both familiar with this locomotive, because its quality was poor and it lacked parts. After the tractor station received a large number of domestically produced "Dongfanghong" tractors, it had long been sidelined.
      "Xiao Chen, how did you get this old timer out here?" Liu Changgen asked Xiao Chen with a reproachful tone.
      "Everyone's hearts are warm in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan," Xiao Chen said. "The station wanted to put out more vehicles. Comrades looked for tricks and came up with ideas, so they repaired it. Unexpectedly, it didn't take long before it broke down again!"
    Zhang Zhenxin, upon hearing Xiao Chen's words, said with a smile, "Xiao Chen, you've thought well! The workers at your tractor station dare to bring out scrapped locomotives for use in supporting the countryside, and the workers at our repair factory can't be ambiguous either. We must also contribute to completing the Third Five-Year Plan, try our best to repair it well, so that it can run and cultivate the land! Xiao Liu, let's check it out first and see what's wrong!"
    Zhang Zhenxin's words made Xiao Liu scratch his head. He said repeatedly, "Da Zhang is right, Da Zhang is right. It seems I am a bit conservative." After speaking, he went to check the locomotive. After a while, he took out some spring fragments from the regulator and said to Zhang Zhenxin, "Da Zhang, the problem is found. The spring in the regulator is broken!"
    Zhang Zhenxin took the spring fragments, furrowed his thick black eyebrows, and observed them calmly.
      "Xiao Liu, do you think it can be repaired?" Xiao Chen asked worriedly, standing aside.
    Xiao Liu said, "This type of tractor and its parts are no longer imported."
      "Ah, what to do then?" Xiao Chen's face immediately sank.
      "How about this," Liu Changgen volunteered, "I'll run back to the factory and look in the warehouse. Maybe I can find two springs for this type of locomotive in the corner."
    Xiao Chen said anxiously, "This is the first spring of the Third Five-Year Plan, truly every moment is worth a thousand gold! This round trip will mean less land plowed!"
    "Besides, you might not even find this kind of spring when you go back." Zhang Zhenxin, who had been frowning in thought all along, spoke up: "But we shouldn't lose heart either. Didn't Chairman Mao teach us: to overcome all difficulties to win victory? I think, let's try using the spring steel sheet we brought first and see if it can be replaced."
      "The hardness of the steel sheet is not enough!" Xiao Liu said.
    "If the hardness is not enough, re-quench it," Zhang Zhenxin said with confidence.
    Liu Changgen thought it made sense when he heard this, and immediately said, "Let's go, let's start a fire!"
    A blazing coal fire was lit in the temporary shed for the tractor drivers to rest. The three of them were busy preparing to repair the car, some adding coal, some tidying up tools, all silent, but their hearts were beating like the flames that darted up and down. The three hearts were thinking the same thing: to win a great victory on the agricultural front in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan!
    At this time, the Party branch secretary of the brigade led several commune members, carrying steaming ginger soup, insisting that Da Zhang and Xiao Liu drink it, saying that the weather was strangely cold, and they were tired from traveling for half a day, so they should drink it to ward off the cold.
    Liu Changgen excitedly took the ginger soup. Before he even tasted it, his heart was already burning hot. He thought, if he didn't repair the locomotive well, he would really be sorry for the good intentions of the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    They hurriedly took a sip of soup and started quenching. The first quenched spring, after being installed, was tested, but the engine did not start. The hardness of the spring was not enough, so they quenched it a second time.
    After the second quenched spring was installed, the locomotive started. "Good!" Xiao Liu was so happy that he danced. But as soon as he finished speaking, the tractor engine stopped abruptly again. Xiao Liu quickly checked, and the spring was broken again.
      "Damn, it's too hard again!" Xiao Liu angrily threw the spring on the ground, bursting out a burst of sparks, "It would be great if there was an instrument to test the hardness of the steel."
    After two unsuccessful quenching attempts, Zhang Zhenxin's thick eyebrows gradually came together. He bit his lip, analyzing the reasons for the failure. Yes, it would be great to have an instrument to test the hardness of the steel. Just then, he saw the sparks that burst out when the steel sheet hit the stone, and suddenly had an idea. He immediately shouted, "Come, come, come and take a look." He picked up a piece of the original broken spring from the locomotive, and then picked up a newly quenched broken spring, and put them on the grinding wheel at the same time. The two broken springs emitted different lights and sparks. He turned to everyone and said, "The sparks emitted by the two springs are different, because the hardness is different. Isn't this spark a very good testing instrument!"
    "Ah, that's true!" This time, everyone's hearts were brightened. Then, they performed a third quenching. After the quenched spring was ground on the grinding wheel, it was proven that the sparks were the same as the original spring before it was installed on the locomotive.
      "Dudu dudu" the locomotive roared. Xiao Chen jumped onto the driver's seat, turned the steering wheel, and the tractor ran out of the village and onto the fields. Da Zhang, Xiao Liu, and some commune members who were watching beside them happily followed, chasing, running, and laughing.
    At this time, the sky was approaching dusk. The land plowed by the tractor, illuminated by the afterglow of the setting sun, was like layers upon layers of golden waves. This spring tide, driven by the hundreds of millions of hardworking people of the motherland, will become bigger and bigger, higher and higher!

    第一个春天
    王拓明
    初春时候，还夹着严冬留下的几分寒意，可是正在赶路的张振新和刘长根，心中却象揣着一个火盆，浑身暖烘烘的。
    张振新和刘长根都是县农业机械修配厂的工人，是跟一个师傅学艺的。今天上午，厂里开动员大会时，他们听了厂长的报告，心里非常激动。厂长的话音现在好象还在他们耳边响着：“为了迎接第三个五年计划的头一个春天，咱们响应党的号召，积极支援农业新高潮，厂里要组织修理小组下乡，缩短拖拉机站的机车修理时间，保证春耕大生产不误农时……”厂里本来决定，修理小组明天一早出发，可是张振新和刘长根等不得。吃过午饭，他俩向领导上表明心意以后，带着工具和必要的配件就出发了。
    他们要去的南湖公社东岗大队，离县城有三四十里路程。那里有县拖拉机站的一个机耕队，在为公社代耕土地。两人一路上小步紧跑，不多久就赶到了。
    走进村子，就见打谷场上围着许多人在那里说说嚷嚷。发生了什么事呢？他们正要走过去看，忽然听见人群里有人喊：“大张！小刘！”随着说话声，挤出一个高个子姑娘来。
    张振新和刘长根一看，原来是拖拉机站第一机耕队队长小陈，连忙同声问她：“小陈，什么事？”
      “快来看看吧！我们正盼着你们哩。”小陈说着，就拉他们向打谷场走去。
    张振新和刘长根大步走上打谷场，立刻，两人都傻了眼：面前停着一台早年进口的拖拉机。这台机车，他们都熟悉，因为它的质量不好，又缺少配件，拖拉机站在接到大量的国产“东方红”之后，它早就靠边站了。
      “小陈，你咋把这台老爷车开了出来呀？”刘长根带着责怪的口气对小陈说。
      “第三个五年计划的头一年，大家心里都热呼呼的。”小陈说，“站里想要多出车。同志们找窍门，想点子，就把它修复了。没想到没用多久，又出了毛病！”
    张振新听了小陈的话，笑迷迷地说：“小陈，你们想得好啊！你们拖拉机站的工人为了支援农村，敢于把报废了的机车开出来使用，咱修配厂的工人也不能含糊，也得为完成第三个五年计划出把力，尽量想法把它修好，好让它嘟嘟地跑着耕地！小刘，咱们还是先检查检查，看看毛病出在哪儿吧！”
    张振新这一番话，说得小刘直搔头皮。他一连声说：“大张说得对，大张说得对。看来我还有点保守呢。”说完，就去检查机车。过了一会，他从调节器里拿出一些弹簧碎片，对张振新说，“大张，毛病找到了。调节器里的弹簧断了！”
    张振新接过弹簧碎片，拧了拧浓黑的眉毛，不动声色地观察着。
      “小刘，你看能修好吗？”站在一旁的小陈担心地问。
    小刘说：“这种牌号的拖拉机和它的配件，早就不进口了。”
      “啊，那怎么办？”小陈的脸一下沉了下来。
      “这样吧，”刘长根自告奋勇地说：“我跑回厂到仓库里找找去。说不定在墙犄角里能找到两个这种机车的弹簧。”
    小陈着急地说，“这是第三个五年计划的第一个春天，真是一刻值千金呀！这一来一回，要少耕多少地哟！”
    “再说，回去也不一定能找到这种弹簧。”一直皱着眉头在思索的张振新开腔了：“不过我们也不要灰心。毛主席不是教导我们：要排除万难，去争取胜利吗？我看，现在咱们就先用带来的弹簧钢片试试吧，看能不能代替。”
      “钢片的硬度不够呀！”小刘说。
    “硬度不够，重新淬火。”张振新满有把握地说。
    刘长根一听，觉得有理，立刻说：“走，咱们生火去！”
    熊熊的煤火，在临时供拖拉机手休息的工棚里生着了。三个人紧张地做着修车准备，有的加煤，有的拾掇工具，都不吱声，但心里却象那窜上窜下的火苗一样跳动着。三条心想的是一回事：让祖国的第三个五年计划的头一年，在农业战线上打个大胜仗！
    这时，大队党支部书记领着几个社员，端着热气腾腾的姜汤来了，硬要大张和小刘喝，说是天怪冷的，赶了半天路，累了，喝了好避寒气。
    刘长根激动地接过姜汤，还没沾嘴，心里就热辣辣的了。心想，要不把机车修好，真对不起贫农、下中农的这份心意。
    他们匆匆呷了口汤，就动手淬火了。第一次淬火的弹簧，装上后，试了试车，没有发动起来。弹簧的硬度不够，他们又淬第二次火。
    第二次淬火的弹簧装上后，机车发动起来了。“好！”小刘高兴得手舞足蹈起来。谁知话音刚落，拖拉机的发动机又嘎然止住了。小刘赶紧检查，弹簧又断了。
      “糟糕，又太硬了！”小刘生气地把弹簧往地上一扔，迸发出一阵火花，“要是有个仪器，检验检验钢的硬度多好。”
    两次淬火没有成功，张振新的浓眉也逐渐靠在一起了。他咬着嘴唇，分析着没成功的原因。是的，能有仪器检验一下钢的硬度就好了。正在这时，他看到钢片砸在石头上迸出的火花，突然灵机一动，立刻嚷嚷起来：“来来来，你们看看。”他拿起原来机车上的一段弹簧断片，又拿起一个新淬火断了的弹簧，同时放在砂轮上打，两个弹簧断片，冒出不同的亮光和火花。他扭头对大家说，“两个弹簧冒的火花不同，是因为硬度不一样，这火花不是一种很好的检验仪器吗！”
    “啊，真是的哩！”这一下，把大家的心都说亮了。接着，他们又进行了第三次淬火。再把淬过火的弹簧经砂轮一打，证明跟原车的弹簧的火花一样，才安上机车。
      “嘟嘟嘟嘟”机车发出了吼叫，小陈一蹦跳上了驾驶台，一转方向盘，拖拉机跑出村庄，驶上田野。大张、小刘和一些在旁边看的社员们都欢天喜地地跟上去，撵着，跑着，笑着。
    这时，天色已近黄昏了。拖拉机翻耕过的土地，被夕阳的余辉一照，恰象是层层叠叠的金色的浪潮。这春天的浪潮啊，在祖国亿万勤劳人民的推动下，将越翻越大，越涌越高！
