    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 28th—Chairman Liu Shaoqi was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of construction workers and residents standing along the road from Rawalpindi to Islamabad on the 28th, when he visited Islamabad, the new capital of Pakistan which is under rapid construction.

    President Ayub Khan accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife on the visit to Islamabad.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife also made the visit.

    Accompanied by President Ayub Khan, Chairman Liu Shaoqi ascended to the top of a small hill, overlooking the entire landscape of the newly constructed city. The rows of new houses, straight roads, and Rawal Lake vividly demonstrate the great efforts made by the Pakistani people to build the new capital.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Since my visit to Islamabad last year, many new houses have been added to the new capital."

    The Director of the Capital Development Authority, Faruqi, introduced the Chinese guests to the Authority's engineers, architects, and other members. The design personnel of this bureau briefed the Chinese guests on the long-term construction plan of the new capital and the progress made so far.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi planted a Chinese tallow tree on the hill. Pakistani friends present said that the evergreen tallow tree symbolizes the lasting friendship between China and Pakistan.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi also visited the site where the permanent building of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan will soon be built. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Ayub Khan jointly planted a tree there. Vice Premier Chen Yi watered the sapling.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi took a car to visit the magnificent office buildings of the various central government departments under construction and the government guesthouse to be completed soon.

    Construction workers in Islamabad welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests by drumming and performing folk dances on the construction site. Their shouts of "Long live!" "Welcome!" mingled with the music of instruments, resounding over the sky of this new city.

    Along the road from Rawalpindi to Islamabad, tens of thousands of local residents stood on both sides of the road, waving Chinese and Pakistani national flags and colorful streamers to welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi's motorcade. Housewives wearing clothes embroidered with gold and silver threads welcomed the Chinese leader on the streets with children in their arms. Chairman Liu Shaoqi waved to thank them.

    Since Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage arrived in Rawalpindi on March 26, the Chinese leaders have always been greeted by people lining the streets whenever they passed by. Today, the crowds lining the streets were even denser.

    After concluding his visit to Islamabad, President Ayub accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi to the Chinese Embassy and took a group photo with Chairman Liu Shaoqi and all the staff of the Chinese Embassy.

    Accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi to Islamabad were: Pakistani Ambassador to China, Rochan, Commissioner of the Rawalpindi Division, Shah, and senior Pakistani officials.

    Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and other members of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's entourage, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu, also accompanied him.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, in the summer of 1959, the Pakistani government decided to build a new capital in Islamabad. Before the new capital was completed, the central government was moved from the old capital Karachi to the temporary capital Rawalpindi.

    Islamabad is located in the northeastern suburbs of Rawalpindi. It is situated on the Potwar Plateau at an altitude of nearly two thousand feet, adjacent to Rawal Lake in the east. It is a scenic place. On the Shala Pariyan Hills nearby, there is a Chinese tallow tree personally planted by Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit to Pakistan in February 1964.

    The construction project of Islamabad started in 1961. Its area will reach 250 square miles, and the city will be divided into administrative and residential areas. The first phase of its construction, including six large buildings for government offices, was completed last year. Since residents began to move in from 1963, the current population has reached more than 30,000. Some departments of the central government are already working in the new capital.

    数万建筑工人和居民夹道欢迎中国领导人
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十八日电  刘少奇主席二十八日参观正在迅速建设中的巴基斯坦新首都伊斯兰堡时，受到了站立在从拉瓦尔品第市到伊斯兰堡的公路两旁的数万建筑工人和居民的热烈欢迎。
    阿尤布·汗总统陪同刘少奇主席和夫人参观了伊斯兰堡。
    副总理陈毅和夫人也进行了参观游览。
    刘少奇主席在阿尤布·汗总统的陪同下，登上一座小山的顶峰，俯瞰正在兴建的这座崭新的城市的全貌。林立的新房屋、笔直的公路和拉瓦尔湖生动地体现了巴基斯坦人民为建设新首都所作出的巨大努力。
    陈毅副总理说：“从我去年访问伊斯兰堡以来，新首都又增添了许多新的房屋。”
    首都建设局局长法鲁基把中国客人介绍给这个局的工程师、建筑师和其他成员。这个局的设计人员向中国客人介绍了新首都的长期建设规划和迄今为止所取得的进展。
    刘少奇主席在山上种了一棵中国乌臼树。在场的巴基斯坦朋友说，常青的乌臼树象征着中巴两国的持久友谊。
    刘少奇主席还到了不久将兴建中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆的永久性大楼的地方。刘少奇主席和阿尤布总统在那里合种了一棵树。陈毅副总理给树苗浇了水。
    刘少奇主席乘车去参观了正在建设中的宏伟的中央政府各部的办公大楼和即将建成的政府招待所。
    伊斯兰堡的建筑工人们一面击鼓，一面在建筑工地上表演民族舞蹈来欢迎中国贵宾。他们发出的“万岁！”“欢迎！”的欢呼声和乐器演奏的音乐声交杂在一起，响彻这个新建城市的上空。
    从拉瓦尔品第到伊斯兰堡的道路上，成千上万的当地居民站在公路两旁，挥舞着中巴两国国旗和彩色纸带来欢迎刘少奇主席的车队。穿着用金线和银线绣成的衣服的家庭妇女抱着小孩，在街道上欢迎中国领导人。刘少奇主席向他们挥手致谢。
    自从刘少奇主席和他的随行人员在三月二十六日到达拉瓦尔品第以来，每当中国领导人在街道上经过的时候，总是受到人民的夹道欢迎。今天夹道欢迎的人群更加密密层层。
    在结束对伊斯兰堡的访问后，阿尤布总统陪同刘少奇主席前往中国大使馆，并同刘少奇主席和中国大使馆的全体工作人员合影。
    陪同刘少奇主席前往伊斯兰堡的还有：巴基斯坦驻中国大使罗查、拉瓦尔品第专区专员沙阿以及巴基斯坦的高级官员们。
    中国外交部副部长章汉夫和刘少奇主席的其他随行人员以及中国驻巴基斯坦大使丁国钰也陪同前往。
    据新华社讯  一九五九年夏天，巴基斯坦政府决定在伊斯兰堡建立一个新首都，在新都建成前，先把中央政府从旧都卡拉奇迁到了临时首都拉瓦尔品第。
    伊斯兰堡在拉瓦尔品第东北郊，它座落在海拔近两千英尺的波特瓦尔高原上，东临拉瓦尔湖，是个山清水秀的地方，在它附近的夏拉帕里安山上，有周恩来总理在一九六四年二月间访问巴基斯坦时亲手种植的乌臼树。
    伊斯兰堡的建筑工程在一九六一年开始动工，它的面积将达二百五十平方英里，全市将分为行政区和住宅区两部分，它的第一期建设工程，包括作为政府办公用的六大片建筑物，已在去年完工。从一九六三年开始迁入居民以来，现在人口已达三万多人。中央政府的一些部门已经在新首都办公。
