    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: The Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 13th, strongly condemning the barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism in using chemical poisons and toxic gases more and more extensively to kill the people of South Vietnam.
    The statement pointed out that the criminal actions of the U.S. aggressors have expanded from sixteen provinces in 1963 to twenty-six provinces in 1965. Since the beginning of this year, while U.S. imperialism has been trying its best to clamor for so-called "peace efforts," it has intensified the spread of chemical poisons in South Vietnam, reaching an average of four or five times a month in some areas. It has used high concentrations of chemical poisons such as CN, DM, CS, and other toxic gases, seriously damaging the health and lives of the people. During each "mopping-up" operation, the U.S. aggressors also sprayed toxic gases into the tunnels where residents were hiding, causing poisoning and death. U.S. chemical poisons have severely damaged large areas of crops and fruit trees and have caused the death of large numbers of livestock.
    The statement pointed out that these facts completely expose the deceptive lies of the U.S. aggressors that the gases used in South Vietnam are "not harmful to humans" and are only used for "weed removal" and "defoliation of jungle trees." The statement said that no weapon and no brutal war tool can subdue a nation that is willing to sacrifice everything for freedom, independence, and peace. The mad actions of U.S. imperialism cannot save it from defeat in South Vietnam, but instead deepen the hatred of the South Vietnamese people towards it and give it more severe punishment.
    The statement called on governments, people's organizations, scientists, legal workers, religious figures, intellectuals, and people all over the world who love freedom, humanity, and justice, especially the American people, to take more resolute actions together with the South Vietnamese people to stop the murderous hands of U.S. imperialism.

    南越民族解放阵线指出美帝野蛮罪行只能激起南越人民更大仇恨
    强烈谴责美帝更加广泛地在南越撒毒
    据新华社河内十六日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义越来越广泛地使用化学毒药和毒气杀害越南南方人民的野蛮罪行。
    声明指出，美国侵略者的这一罪恶行动已从一九六三年的十六个省扩大到一九六五年的二十六个省。今年年初以来，美帝国主义在竭力叫嚷所谓“和平努力”的同时，更加紧在越南南方撒放化学毒药，有的地区每个月平均达到四、五次。它使用了高浓度的CN、DM、CS等化学毒药和其它毒气，严重地损害了人民的健康和生命。美国侵略者在每次“扫荡”中，还向隐蔽着居民的地洞喷射毒气，使里边的人中毒和死亡。美国化学毒药严重地破坏了大片农作物和果树，并使大批牲畜死亡。
    声明指出，这些事实完全揭穿了美国侵略者所谓在越南南方使用的是“对人类没有毒害”的气体，只是为了“除莠”和“使丛林树叶掉落”的骗人鬼话。声明说，没有任何一种武器和任何一种残暴的战争工具，能够使一个为了自由、独立、和平而不惜牺牲一切的民族屈服。美帝国主义的疯狂行动不仅不能挽救它在越南南方的败局，反而更加深了越南南方人民对它的仇恨，给它以更严厉的惩罚。
    声明呼吁各国政府、人民团体、科学工作者、法律工作者、宗教界人士、知识界人士和全世界爱好自由、人道和正义的人民，特别是美国人民，同越南南方人民一起采取更坚决的行动来制止美帝国主义的杀人魔掌。
