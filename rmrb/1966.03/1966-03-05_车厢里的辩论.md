    Debate in the Train Car
    Wang Xueqin
    In the waiting room of the Liuhuaqiao Railway Station in Guangzhou, a group of grassroots cadres and commune members from Nanhai County, after visiting the National Exhibition of Agricultural Models of Dazhai-style agriculture in Guangzhou, were waiting for their train home.

    The departure time had not yet arrived, so everyone began to talk about their impressions of the visit over the past few days. Some said that as long as the Dazhai spirit was carried forward, any miracle could be created. However, some people disagreed. Some cadres from the Yanbu Commune said: "The production conditions in Dazhai are poor, and it is impossible without arduous struggle to control mountains and rivers; we are in a plain area, and although the Dazhai spirit is good, I am afraid we cannot learn it."

    Soon, the train was about to head towards Foshan. The cadres from Yanbu Commune boarded a carriage. Subsequently, a woman in her forties came up, dragging one child and carrying another on her back, sweating profusely.

      "Are you also going to visit the exhibition?" A cadre from the Hedong Brigade looked at the tired mother and asked with concern.

    The woman nodded.
    "Dragging one, carrying one, going up and down, squeezing around, it's not worth visiting, why bother with such hardship!"

    The woman widened her eyes in surprise and said, "The Dazhai spirit is famous throughout the country. After this visit, it has changed my thinking and boosted my spirit. It's a rare good opportunity, how can I not visit!"

    The cadre felt a little embarrassed after hearing this, and changed his tone and said, "Then wouldn't it be better to leave the children at home?"
      "No, I have four more children at home, and my husband can't take care of that many. It's better to keep the little ones with me. Not to mention this visit, but even in the past when I went to other places to learn advanced experiences, it was common for me to carry my children on my back and walk ten or eight *li*. As long as I lead the team's production well, what's the big deal with being a little tired?"

    Their conversation attracted the attention of another cadre nearby. He was Li Lin, the captain of the Jianhe Second Team. Originally, Li Lin had a concern. He thought being a cadre was a troublesome matter, taking up time and attending many meetings. He had said long ago that he didn't want to do it anymore, but the masses had elected him again, and he felt it was "difficult to refuse," so he reluctantly worked another year "part-time." Now, he was surprised to find that this mother of six also said she wanted to lead the team's production well. He wanted to confirm it, so he moved forward and asked:

    "Are you a production team leader?"
      "Yes, I am a production team leader."
    "Can you read?"
      "I was born in the old society and never attended school for a single day, I can't read."
    "Then how do you arrange work every day?"
      "Sometimes I point out the tasks on the spot and assign work to the commune members face-to-face; sometimes I put up signs and ask my husband to help."

    As she said this, Tan Hai, the captain of the Yingyong Second Production Team, also came over. Tan Hai had been praised many times since he became the captain. However, his wife often said that being a cadre was a disadvantage and didn't want him to be a cadre, and the couple had quarreled several times without resolving the issue. Now, hearing this female captain say that her husband helps with work arrangements, he couldn't help but blurt out, "Your husband is really good, able to lend you a hand, that's great, that's great. But my wife is not as good as your husband, she often holds me back."

    The female captain heard the praise for her husband, smiled and shook her head, seemingly not fully agreeing. She said, "You say he's good? You're overpraising him. I've had several struggles with him too! Once, he looked after the cattle for the team and was given six *fen*, but he complained that it was too little. I said that according to the principle of distribution according to work, six *fen* is not a small amount. With one rebuttal, he angrily said to me, if you continue to be the captain, we'll get a divorce... "

    People heard about this incident, and someone interrupted her and said, "Between husband and wife, you should accommodate each other a little, small things can be resolved, why be so serious."
    The female captain disagreed with this statement, and she raised her voice and continued: "I want revolution, he doesn't want revolution, could I follow him and not make revolution? There's no way. Later, I reasoned with him, helped him recall and compare, and fought to the end. In the end, I won, and now he's even become an agronomist!"

    The female captain's words struck Tan Hai's heart, making him feel admiration from the bottom of his heart, and also making him realize that family problems often reflect the struggle between two ideologies and two roads. In dealing with family problems, we must also adhere to the revolutionary stance and revolutionary principles.

    At this time, Li Lin, who was listening quietly on the side, heard the female captain speak so resolutely, and raised his question:

      "You are obsessed with being a cadre, your remuneration must be high there, is it calculated based on the average work points of the three strongest and highest work point-earning commune members in the team?"

      "No, no, I work like the commune members, and I rely on work points to eat." The female captain replied calmly.

    Li Lin thought he had found someone who agreed with him, and said his heartfelt words: "We production team leaders just spend energy, spend time, and use a lot of money. Besides, you have a string of children, being a cadre is really 'losing money'!"

    "Being a cadre is 'losing money'?" These words would have been fine if they hadn't been spoken, but once they were spoken, they stirred up the female captain's class feelings. She seriously educated this young production team leader: "'Losing money'? You have to think about what our 'bottom' is like! When I was eleven years old, I was sold to the capitalist of the Gaosheng Tea House in Sanshui to be a 'maid', burning firewood, carrying water, grinding rice every day, working non-stop from morning to night. More than a year later, the tea house closed down, and the capitalist sold me to the Lubao Earth Sugar Factory like goods. I slept at midnight and got up at five o'clock, serving people, serving cattle, and torturing me beyond recognition. After two years, the capitalist sold me to a rice shop in Datang Market in Sanshui, carrying water, cooking, and serving the 'master's wife' (boss's wife), enduring beatings and scoldings every day. I couldn't bear it any longer, so I risked my life to escape. Who knew that when I returned home, my parents had already starved to death, and the house had been torn down. I was alone and helpless. Later, I married the poor peasant Ye Deng, and the clothes I wore for my wedding were borrowed. After marriage, under the oppression of the landlords, life was equally difficult. Sometimes we picked snails to exchange for sweet potato flour, sometimes we worked for the landlords, living in hunger and cold, year after year. This is my original 'bottom'. Now we eat our fill and dress warmly, but we must not forget the past! If it weren't for the Party leading us to liberate and turn over, where would we be today? Everyone can think about what we have 'lost'? And what have we gained? For the revolution, for the people, even if we earn a few less work points, what does it matter!"

    These righteous words moved the cadres in the carriage. Everyone cheered, some said that this was a real spiritual atomic bomb. Some said that this time the White Bone Demon had met the Monkey King, and our ugly thoughts had been exposed. The knot in Li Lin's heart was also untied by the female captain. He was also touched by class feelings, and felt that he was a man, educated, with fewer burdens, but treated the revolution half-heartedly. Compared with this female captain, he was truly ashamed of himself. Afterwards, he and everyone else said convincingly: "This female captain is not simple, she targeted our thoughts step by step and put us in checkmate, giving us a vivid political lesson."

    But what was the name of this female captain? After talking for so long, no one knew. A female cadre from the Pingzhou Commune helped them reveal the mystery: She is Comrade Zuo Feng, the captain of the Daji Production Team of the Shiken Brigade of the Pingzhou Commune.

    Zuo Feng? This name sounds familiar. Someone remembered: She is a member of the preparatory committee of the county's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, attended the provincial representative meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants, and is an activist in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

    The story doesn't end here. The next day, the people who had heard Zuo Feng's speech had undergone great changes in their thinking. In particular, Li Lin, who said that being a cadre was "losing money," quickly bought a copy of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and eagerly read articles such as "Serve the People" and "Get Rid of the Baggage and Start the Machine," and once again opened fire on his bad thoughts. Later, the news of Zuo Feng's debate with everyone in the carriage spread to the Nanhai County Party Committee, and the County Party Committee invited Comrade Zuo Feng to give a report to thousands of grassroots cadres, allowing everyone to receive a vivid education once again.

### 车厢里的辩论

    车厢里的辩论
    汪学勤
    在广州流花桥火车站候车室里，南海县的一批基层干部和社员，看过在广州展出的全国大寨式农业典型展览之后，正在候车回家。
    开车的时间还没有到，大家便谈起这几天参观的感想。有的人说，只要发扬大寨精神，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。但是，也有些人不以为然。盐步公社的一些干部说：“大寨生产条件差，不艰苦奋斗治山治水就不行；我们这里是平原地区，大寨精神虽好，恐怕我们学不到。”
    不久，火车快要朝佛山开了。盐步公社的干部上了一个车厢。随后，上来了一个四十来岁的妇女，她带着一双儿女，拖一个，背一个，累得满头大汗。
      “你也是去参观展览会的吗？”河东大队一个干部看着这个受累的母亲，带着关切的口气问。
    妇女点点头。
    “拖一个，背一个，上上下下，挤来挤去，不参观也罢，何必这样辛苦！”
    妇女诧异地睁亮了眼睛，说：“大寨精神全国闻名，经过这次参观，使我换思想，振精神。难得有这个好机会，怎能不去参观！”
    那位干部听了，有点不好意思，转口说：“那你把孩子留在家里，不是好一些吗？”
      “不，我家里还有四个小孩，丈夫管不了这样多。小的随身带着好，莫说这次来参观，就是往日我到外地学先进经验，背着孩子走十里八里也是平常事。只要把队的生产领导好，辛苦点怕什么？”
    他们两人的谈话，引起旁边另一个干部的注意。他是建和二队队长李林。原来李林有一件心事，他认为当干部是件麻烦事，花时间，多开会，早就说不干了，只是群众又把他选上，他感到“人情难却”，才勉强再打一年“短工”。如今，竟然发现这位有了六个孩子的母亲也说要把队的生产领导好，觉得有点稀奇。他想证实一下，移步向前，问：
    “你是生产队长吗？”
      “对，我是生产队长。”
    “你识字不识字？”
      “生在旧社会，没有读过一天书，不识字。”
    “那你日常怎样排工？”
      “有时现场点兵，当面给社员排工；有时挂牌子，叫丈夫帮助。”
    她说到这里，莺涌第二生产队队长谭海也过来了。谭海自从当了队长，受到多次表扬。可是，他的妻子却经常说当干部吃亏，不让他当干部，两口子闹了几次，问题还没有解决。现在听到这位女队长说她丈夫帮助排工，不禁脱口说：“你丈夫真好，能助你一臂之力，不错，不错。但我的妻子却不如你的丈夫，她经常拉我后腿。”
    女队长听了赞扬她丈夫的话，含笑地摇摇头，似乎不完全赞同。她说：“你说他不错吗？太过奖了。我和他也有几次斗争哩！有一次，他给队里看牛，给他记了六分，他嫌记得少。我说按劳取酬，六分不算少。一顶撞，他气冲冲地对我说，你再当队长，离婚好了。……”
    人们听到这件事，有人打断她的话，说：“夫妻之间，互相迁就一下，小事便化为无，何必这样认真。”
    女队长不同意这个说法，她提高嗓子继续说：“我要革命，他不要革命，难道我能跟着他不革命？没有这回事。后来我和他说理说法，帮他回忆对比，斗到底。结果还是我赢了，现在他还当了农艺师呢！”
    女队长的话，句句打中谭海的心，使他不得不从心里感到佩服，而且使他认识到：家庭问题也往往反映着两种思想和两条道路的斗争。处理家庭问题，也要坚持革命的立场，革命的原则。
    这时候，在一旁静听的李林，听到女队长说得这样坚决，又提出他的疑问：
      “你当干部入了迷，你们那里干部报酬一定高，是不是按队里劳动力最强、工分最多的三个社员的平均工分计算的呢？”
      “不，不，我和社员一样劳动，靠工分吃饭。”女队长不动声色地答。
    李林以为找到了共鸣的人，便说出心里话：“我们做生产队长的就是花精神，花时间，用钱多。何况你有一串儿女，当干部真是‘蚀底’呵！”
    “当干部‘蚀底’？”这话不说犹可，一说就挑动了女队长的阶级感情。她严肃地教育这位年轻的生产队长：“‘蚀底’？可要想想我们的‘底’是怎样的呀！我十一岁被卖给三水高升茶楼的资本家做‘妹仔’，天天烧火、担水、磨米，从朝到晚不停手。一年多后，茶楼结业，资本家又把我当货物一样转卖到芦苞土榨糖厂，三更睡，五更起，服侍人，服侍牛，把我折磨得不成人。过了两年，资本家又把我转卖到三水大塘墟一间米铺，担水、煮饭和侍候‘事头’（老板）婆，天天挨打挨骂，忍受不下去了，我才拼死一走。谁料回到家里，父母早已饿死，屋也拆光，无依无靠，孤单一人。后来，我就和贫农叶登结婚，出嫁的衣服也是借来穿的。结婚后，我们在地主压迫下，生活同样不好过。有时拾螺换薯粉吃，有时替地主打工，饥饥寒寒，一年挨一年。这就是我原来的‘底’。现在我们吃饱穿暖，可不能忘记过去呵！要不是党领导我们解放闹翻身，我们那有今日？大家可以想一想，我们‘蚀’了什么？得的又是什么？为革命，为人民就算少赚几个工分，又算得什么！”
    这番正气凛然的话，车厢里的干部听了都很感动。大家哄起来了，有的说，这真是一颗精神原子弹。有的说，这回是白骨精碰到了孙悟空，我们的丑思想都给她戳穿了。李林心里的结，也给女队长解松了。他也触动了阶级感情，觉得自己是个男子，有文化，拖累少，却是半心半意对待革命，对比这位女队长，真是自愧不如。事后他和大家都口服心服地说：“这位女队长不简单，她针对我们的思想步步‘将军’，给我们上了一堂活的政治课。”
    可是，这位女队长叫什么名字呢？谈了半天，大家都不知道。一位平洲公社女干部帮他们揭谜：她，就是平洲公社石啃大队大基生产队队长左凤同志。
    左凤？这名字好熟。有人记起来了：她是县贫下中农协会的筹备委员，出席过省贫下中农代表会议，是活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。
    故事到此还没有结束。第二天，听过左凤讲话的人，思想都起了很大的变化。特别是说当干部“蚀底”的李林，赶紧买了一本《毛泽东著作选读》，如饥如渴地读《为人民服务》《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章，再一次向自己的坏思想开火。后来，左凤在车厢里和大伙辩论的消息传到了南海县委会，县委又请左凤同志向数千基层干部作报告，让大家再一次受到生动的教育。
