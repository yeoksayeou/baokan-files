    Ghanaian Authorities Unreasonably Demand Withdrawal of Our Experts and Reduction of Staff at Our Embassy
    Our Embassy Lodges Strong Protest with Ghanaian Foreign Ministry
    Note Points Out This Is Another Serious Step by Ghanaian Authorities Deliberately Tearing Up the Sino-Ghanaian Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation and Undermining Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries. The Ghanaian Side Must Bear Full Responsibility for Damaging the Agreement and Causing Economic Losses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 5th – The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Accra, Huang Shixie, met with the Principal Secretary of the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry on March 3rd and handed over a note from the Chinese Embassy to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry, strongly protesting the Ghanaian authorities' unreasonable demand for the withdrawal of Chinese experts and the reduction of Chinese embassy personnel, and their serious actions deliberately tearing up the Sino-Ghanaian Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and undermining the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
    The full text of the note is as follows: To the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Accra presents its compliments to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry and states the following with regard to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry's memorandum of February 28, 1966:
    The memorandum of February 28, 1966, from Mr. Kwao, Principal Secretary of the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry, to Mr. Huang Shixie, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Accra, demanded the immediate withdrawal from Ghana of all Chinese technical experts working in Ghana, and demanded the immediate reduction of the Chinese Embassy staff to eighteen people. Following the February 27th incident in which four Chinese, including the leader of the Chinese construction experts group, experts, and embassy staff, were unreasonably detained in the Accra Police Headquarters by the Ghanaian army and brutally beaten, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry put forward such unilateral and unreasonable demands. This can only be regarded as another serious step by the Ghanaian side deliberately tearing up the Sino-Ghanaian Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and undermining the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Ghana. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China lodges a strong protest with the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry against this.
    Chinese engineering experts and technicians were sent to Ghana under the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement signed by the governments of China and Ghana and relevant agreements for the construction of industrial and agricultural projects. The Ghanaian side is fully aware that the construction of the Komenda Textile Knitting Integrated Factory and the Kumasi Pencil Factory is in full swing, and most of the construction materials and machinery and equipment for the two factories have already been shipped to Ghana. Since October 1965, the nine main workshops of the textile knitting integrated factory have been under construction, and more than 7,000 tons of materials and equipment have been shipped to Ghana. Construction of the pencil factory began in January 1966, and more than 1,000 tons of materials and equipment have also been shipped to Ghana. The Chinese side has also paid the local expenses required for construction in accordance with the agreement. The current step taken by the Ghanaian side is to completely tear up the economic and technical cooperation agreement and related agreements between the two countries, and because of the interruption of construction, these two projects will suffer serious losses. Therefore, the Chinese Embassy solemnly points out that the Ghanaian side must bear full responsibility for damaging the agreement and causing economic losses.
    Chinese experts and technicians should have returned to their own country according to the agreement after the completion of the relevant construction projects. However, since the Ghanaian side cannot guarantee the dignity and personal safety of the Chinese experts, and unilaterally and unreasonably demands that all Chinese experts withdraw from Ghana, under this circumstance, the Chinese side is forced to agree to withdraw its experts from Ghana. However, the Chinese side cannot abandon the above-mentioned factory projects and a large amount of construction equipment and materials without anyone from the Ghanaian side taking over. Out of a sense of responsibility for the friendship between the Chinese and Ghanaian people and the Sino-Ghanaian Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, the Chinese Embassy hereby makes the following demands to the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry:
    1. The Ghanaian side shall immediately send responsible officials to Komenda and Kumasi to sign for the acceptance of the above-mentioned two projects and materials and equipment.
    2. The Ghanaian side shall immediately send responsible officials to Tema Port and Accra to sign for the acceptance of the equipment and materials belonging to the above-mentioned two projects.
    3. The Chinese side hopes that the Ghanaian side will complete the above-mentioned signing and acceptance procedures in the shortest possible time, without delay.
    4. In order to hand over the projects and equipment and materials to the Ghanaian side, the Chinese side has prepared a list of materials and a description of the project progress, and has designated the economic counselor's office of the embassy and relevant experts to handle the handover matters. The Ghanaian side must be fully responsible for the safety of the Chinese experts during their stay in Ghana to complete the handover matters.
    In the memorandum of the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry, the Ghanaian side also suddenly demanded that the staff of the Chinese Embassy must be reduced to eighteen people. It must be pointed out that this request is unreasonable and is deliberately undermining the friendly relations between China and Ghana. In view of the unfriendly attitude of the Ghanaian side, the Chinese government has decided to reduce the number of personnel at the Chinese Embassy in Accra.
    The Chinese Embassy requests the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry to provide practical security guarantees for the withdrawal of Chinese personnel and to provide the necessary facilities.
    Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.　　Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Accra
                                      March 1, 1966

    加纳当局无理要求撤走我专家减少我使馆人员
    我大使馆向加纳外交部提出强烈抗议
    照会指出，这是加纳当局蓄意撕毁中加两国经济技术合作协定和破坏两国友好关系的又一严重步骤。加纳方面必须承担破坏协定和造成经济损失的全部责任。
    新华社五日讯　阿克拉消息：中华人民共和国驻阿克拉大使馆临时代办黄世燮三月三日约见加纳外交部主任秘书，面交了一份中国大使馆给加纳外交部的照会，强烈抗议加纳当局无理要求撤走中国专家和减少中国使馆人员、蓄意撕毁中加两国经济技术合作协定和破坏两国友好关系的严重行动。
    照会全文如下：加纳外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻阿克拉大使馆向加纳外交部致意，并就加纳外交部一九六六年二月二十八日的备忘录申述如下：
    一九六六年二月二十八日加纳外交部主任秘书夸奥先生面交中华人民共和国驻阿克拉大使馆临时代办黄世燮先生的备忘录，要求所有在加纳工作的中国技术专家立即撤离加纳，并要求中国大使馆人员立即减少为十八人。在二月二十七日发生了中国建筑专家组组长、专家和大使馆工作人员等四人被加纳军队无理拘留在阿克拉警察总局并遭到残暴殴打致伤的暴行事件之后，加纳外交部又提出这种片面无理的要求，这只能被认为是加纳方面蓄意撕毁中加经济技术合作协定和破坏中加两国友好合作关系的又一严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国大使馆向加纳外交部提出强烈抗议。
    中国的工程专家和技术人员，是根据中加两国政府签订的经济技术合作协定和建设工农业项目的有关协议派到加纳的。加纳方面完全知道，角旁纺织针织联合工厂和库马西铅笔厂的建设工程正在全面施工，两个工厂的建筑材料和机器设备也已大部运到加纳。自一九六五年十月开始，纺织针织联合工厂的九个主要车间已在施工，七千余吨物资和器材已运抵加纳。铅笔厂自一九六六年一月开始施工，一千余吨物资和器材也已运抵加纳。中国方面并已根据协议支付了施工所需的当地费用。加纳方面目前采取的这一步骤，就是彻底撕毁了两国经济技术合作协定和有关协议，并且由于中断施工，使这两项工程遭受到严重的损失。因此，中国大使馆严正指出：加纳方面必须承担破坏协定和造成经济损失的全部责任。
    中国专家和技术人员本来应该按照协议，在有关工程建设竣工后返回自己的国家。但是，目前加纳方面既然不能保证中国专家的尊严和人身安全，而且又片面无理地要求中国专家全部撤离加纳，在此情况下，中国方面被迫同意把它在加纳的专家撤走。但是，中国方面不能在加方无人接管的情况下，将上述工厂工程和大量建筑设备和物资器材弃置不顾。中国大使馆出于对中加人民友谊和中加经济技术合作协定的责任心，特向加纳外交部提出如下要求：
    一、加纳方面立即派出负责官员到角旁和库马西，签字接收上述两项工程及物资器材。
    二、加纳方面立即派出负责官员到特马港口和阿克拉，签字接收属于上述两项工程的器材和物资。
    三、中国方面希望加纳方面在最短期内，完成上述签字接收手续，不予拖延。
    四、为了向加纳方面移交工程和器材物资，中国方面已备妥物资清单和工程进度说明，并指定大使馆经济参赞处和有关专家办理移交事宜。中国专家为完成移交事宜在加纳居留期间的安全问题，加纳方面必须负完全责任。
    在加纳外交部的备忘录中，加纳方面还突然地要求中国大使馆人员必须减少为十八人。必须指出，这一要求是无理的，是蓄意破坏中加两国友好关系的。鉴于加纳方面的不友好态度，中国政府决定减少中国驻阿克拉大使馆的人员。
    中国大使馆要求加纳外交部对中国人员的撤离给予切实的安全保证，并提供必需的便利条件。
    顺致崇高的敬意。　　中华人民共和国驻阿克拉大使馆
                                      一九六六年三月一日
