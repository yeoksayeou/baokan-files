    Overcoming Difficulties, Opening Up a New Situation
    The patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Leopoldville) have recently launched extensive attacks in the east and northeast, achieving victories.
    Some time ago, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs launched a fierce counterattack and occupied some cities in eastern and northeastern Congo (Leopoldville), arrogantly shouting that the "war against the rebels is over" and that "rebellious activities no longer exist." This kind of self-deceiving nonsense is extremely ridiculous. Imperialism and its running dogs can never extinguish the revolutionary armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people. The revolutionary situation in the Congo (Leopoldville) is not as bad as imperialism says, but very good.
    The revolutionary road is always tortuous, not straight. Revolutionary struggles will have their ebbs and flows. Especially in the early stages of the revolution, when revolutionary forces are relatively weak, it is inevitable to encounter various difficulties and setbacks. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "At certain times in revolutionary struggles, difficult conditions outweigh favorable conditions. At such times, difficulty is the main aspect of the contradiction, and smoothness is the secondary aspect. However, through the efforts of the revolutionaries, difficulties can be gradually overcome, and a new situation of smoothness can be opened up, with the difficult situation giving way to the smooth situation." As long as all revolutionary forces are not intimidated by difficulties, see the bright future, and maintain confidence and perseverance in the struggle, they will certainly overcome all difficulties and move towards victory. The people of the Congo (Leopoldville) are following such a path. In the Congo (Leopoldville), a new revolutionary high tide will surely arrive.

### 克服困难，开展新局面

    克服困难，开展新局面
    刚果（利）爱国武装力量最近在东部和东北部广泛出击，取得了胜利。
    前些时候，美帝国主义和它的走狗气势汹汹地进行反扑，占领了刚果（利）东部和东北部一些城市，便不可一世地大叫大嚷什么“对叛乱分子的战争已经结束”了，什么“叛乱活动不再存在”了。这种自欺欺人的鬼话是十分可笑的。帝国主义和它的走狗根本不可能扑灭刚果（利）人民的革命武装斗争。刚果（利）的革命形势并不是象帝国主义所说的糟得很，而是好得很。
    革命的道路，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。革命的斗争，都会有它的低潮和高潮。特别是在革命的初期，革命的力量处于较弱的阶段，就不可避免地要遇到这样那样的困难和波折。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”一切革命力量只要不被困难所吓倒，看到光明的前途，满怀信心，坚持斗争，他们就一定能排除万难，走向胜利。刚果（利）人民正是在走着这样一条道路。在刚果（利），一个新的革命高潮，是一定会到来的。
