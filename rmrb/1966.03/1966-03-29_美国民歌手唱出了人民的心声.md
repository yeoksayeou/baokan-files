    In the American people's struggle against the war of aggression in Vietnam, a group of anti-war singers deeply loved by the masses and anti-war songs widely circulated among the masses have emerged.
    Accompanied by the melody of the guitar, Pete Seeger, who sings songs like a rap, Joan Baez, an American female college student with a beautiful and clear soprano voice who is most popular among young people, and Bob Dylan, who travels around university campuses to sing, have deeply resonated with American youth with their songs "Against the Vietnam War" and "Give Freedom to Black People!"
    These folk singers, who are hailed as "anti-war singers" and "the conscience of America," have grown up in the long-term struggle and music movement of the American people. In the 1940s, when World War II ended, a group of people who attempted to combine with trade unions to support traditional American music formed the "People's Song Association." Pete Seeger was a central figure in it. However, when the Korean War broke out in 1950, during the subsequent so-called "Cold War" period, almost all American trade unions turned to the right and were controlled by leaders who served aggression. At this time, the Un-American Activities Committee, which specialized in "hunting down communists," summoned Pete Seeger. Seeger resolutely refused to provide testimony and was sentenced to two years in prison, and his musical group was forced to disband. However, during the arduous struggle, folk singers and songwriters centered around Pete Seeger never stopped singing. During this period, they sang many songs praising workers in struggle, such as "Union Maid," and continuously released songs born from the "Civil Rights Movement" and anti-war struggles against discrimination against Black people. At a time when the twist and rock and roll were popular, these songs increasingly penetrated the hearts of the American people.
    On August 28, 1963, the American people held the March on Washington against racial discrimination. Pete Seeger and many other singers participated in this demonstration, which was the largest in American history, with more than 200,000 people. The song "We Shall Overcome" uses the melody of an old Black spiritual with new lyrics of struggle. The song goes:
      "We shall overcome,
    We shall overcome,
    We shall overcome, some day.
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We shall overcome, some day.
    We'll walk hand in hand,
    We'll walk hand in hand,
    We'll walk hand in hand, some day.
  ..."
    This song was sung among Black people in the southern states of the United States. During this march, it became a song of the movement for freedom and peace throughout the United States. In the actions against the war of aggression in Vietnam, which have spread throughout the United States since the beginning of last year, this song has been popular and widely circulated.
    In March 1965, Seeger and some famous musicians participated in the Alabama march. Seeger collected many songs sung during the march and promoted them throughout the United States through their music publications. These songs, called "anti-war songs" and "songs of resistance," were widely circulated among the masses.
    Pete Seeger visited Japan in the autumn of 1963. After arriving in Japan, he sang songs such as "We Shall Overcome" and "Bourgeois Blues," which exposed the corruption of American capitalists, causing headaches for the American government and the Japanese reactionary music organization "Onkyo." He sang aloud:
      "The hounds are not scary,
    The water dragons are not scary,
    Prisons are not scary,
    Because I want freedom."
    Forty-eight-year-old Seeger also expressed to the Japanese people his firm will to resolutely refuse to be used for American cultural aggression. He said: "My songs are loved by people. However, every country has outstanding songs cultivated by its own people. I don't like forgetting such songs and promoting American folk songs like Coca-Cola." He also rejected the request of the US Embassy in Japan for him to perform at US military bases for troop entertainment.
    Bob Dylan, a twenty-five-year-old American young singer, sings songs such as "Talkin' World War III Blues," "Blowin' in the Wind," and "Masters of War," giving fierce criticism and satire to the aggressors. In "Masters of War," he sings:
      "You that never done nothin'
    But build to destroy
    You play with my world
    Like it's your little toy
    You put a gun in my hand
    And you hide from my eyes
    And you turn and run farther
    When the fast bullets fly

    Like Judas of old
    You lie and deceive
    A world war can be won
    You want me to believe
    But I see through your eyes
    And I see through your brain
    Like I see through the water
    That runs down my drain

    You fasten the triggers
    For the others to fire
    Then you sit back and watch
    When the death count gets higher
    You hide in your mansion
    While the young men's blood
    Flows out of their bodies
    And is buried in the mud"
    This song constantly repeats the line: "I know your face". The "you" in the song refers to US President Johnson. This song has attracted a wide range of young people in the United States.
    Joan Baez, a twenty-five-year-old who is known as the "Princess of Folk Songs," announced after finishing a performance at a gathering attended by US President Johnson and his wife: "It is said that 60 percent of my income tax is used for US military equipment. I am fundamentally opposed to war. Therefore, I cannot pay taxes for war!" Her declaration was broadcast throughout the United States via television. She earns no less than $200,000 a year from record sales alone. However, she donates almost all of her income to the anti-war movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam and the movement against racial discrimination.
    American anti-war songs are inspiring the broad masses participating in the struggle. And the singers who sing anti-war songs have also been educated in the struggle, thus deepening their understanding of reality and the aggressive war of US imperialism. Joan Baez said at a press conference in London: "Now, the United States is invading Vietnam. Therefore, it is the United States that must stop the aggression. It's ridiculous to talk about 'terrible communism.' There is nothing worse than being complacent about bombing, killing, burning houses, and forests. The best thing is to stop doing that as soon as possible. The Viet Cong is winning. The Viet Cong enters the village and is loved by the people. Because there is nothing worse than Americans staying in Vietnam..." She spoke the words in the hearts of millions of ordinary Americans. (Kui) (Attached picture)

    美国民歌手唱出了人民的心声
    在美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争中，涌现出一批深受群众欢迎的反对侵略战争歌手和在群众中广为传诵的反对侵略战争歌曲。
    伴随着吉他的旋律、宛如说唱一般演唱歌曲的皮特·西戈，有着优美清脆的女高音歌喉、最受青年欢迎的美国女大学生约翰·芭叶兹，走遍大学学园进行演唱的博布·迪兰，他们演唱的《反对越南战争》、《给黑人以自由！》的歌声，在美国青年人中间深深地引起共鸣。
    被人们誉为“反战歌手”、“美国的良心”的这些民谣歌手们，是在美国人民的长期斗争和音乐运动中成长起来的。四十年代第二次世界大战结束的时候，企图同工会结合起来扶植美国传统音乐的一批人，成立了“人民歌曲协会”。皮特·西戈就是其中的核心人物。但是，一九五○年侵朝战争爆发，在其后的所谓“冷战”时期，美国的工会几乎都向右转，被那些替侵略效劳的领导人所把持。这时，专事“追捕赤色分子”的非美活动委员会曾传讯皮特·西戈。西戈断然拒绝提供证词，因而被判刑两年，他的那个音乐团体也被迫解散。然而，在艰苦的斗争时期，以皮特·西戈为中心的民谣歌手、作词家，始终没有停止歌唱。他们在这个时期演唱了歌颂斗争中的工人的《工会少女》等许多歌曲接连不断地发表了反对歧视黑人的“民权运动”和反战斗争中诞生的歌曲。就在扭摆舞、摇摆舞盛行的时候，这些歌曲却日益深入美国人民的心中。
    一九六三年八月二十八日，美国人民举行了反对种族歧视的华盛顿大进军。皮特·西戈以及其他好多歌手，投入了这个有二十多万人参加的美国历史上最大的一次示威游行。《胜利属于我们》这支歌子，是用古老的黑人赞美诗的旋律配以新的斗争的歌词。这支歌唱道：
      “那一天定会到来，
    伟大胜利的日子，
    总有一天会到来。
    噢，我心灵深处在渴盼这一天！
    我们手挽着手，
    并肩前进，
    直到取得伟大胜利的一天
  ……”
    这支歌是在美国南方各州的黑人中间唱开的。它在这次大进军中成为全美国的争取自由与和平的运动的歌曲。在从去年年初起扩展到整个美国的反对侵越战争的行动中，这支歌一直脍炙人口，传诵不绝。
    一九六五年三月，西戈和一些著名的音乐家都参加了亚拉巴马大游行。西戈采集了大游行中唱的许多歌曲，并且通过他们的音乐刊物向全美国推广。这些歌曲被称为“反战歌”、“抵抗之歌”，在群众中广泛流传开来。
    皮特·西戈在一九六三年秋天曾访问过日本。他到日本后，演唱了《胜利属于我们》、揭发美国大资本家腐败情形的《资产阶级布鲁士》等为美国政府和日本反动音乐组织“音协”所头痛的歌曲。他昂首高歌：
      “警犬不可怕，
    水龙不可怕，
    监狱也不可怕，
    因为我要自由。”
    四十八岁的西戈还向日本人民表明他断然拒绝为美国文化侵略所利用的坚定意志。他说：“我的歌为人们所喜爱。但是，任何国家都有为自己国家的人民所培育的杰出的歌曲。忘却这种歌曲而象可口可乐那样推广美国的民谣，我不喜欢这样做。”他还拒绝了美国驻日大使馆让他到美军基地作慰问演唱的要求。
    二十五岁的美国青年歌手博布·迪兰演唱的《说唱第三次世界大战》、《风吹草动》，《战争罪魁》等歌曲，对侵略者给予激烈的抨击和讽刺。他在《战争罪魁》中唱道：
      “你用自己的双手扳起了枪机，
    然而一旦到开枪的时候，
    你却硬要把枪塞给别人。
    战死者的数目增多了，
    可你只是坐在宝座上，
    若无其事地数着死人的数目！
    年青人的鲜血，
    从他们的体内迸流；
    可你竟躲在白宫里不肯出来。”
    这首歌子里不断地重复着一句词：“我了解你的真面目”。歌中的“你”就是指美国总统约翰逊。这首歌子吸引了美国的广大青年。
    被称为“民歌公主”的二十五岁的约翰·芭叶兹，在美国总统约翰逊和他的妻子出席的一次集会上演唱完毕后，宣布说：“据说我纳的所得税的百分之六十被用于美国的军备。我是根本反对战争的。因此，我不能为战争纳税！”她的这个宣言经由电视转播到全美国。她仅靠所灌的唱片收入一年就不下二十万美元。然而，她几乎把所有的收入都献给反对侵越战争运动和反对种族歧视运动。
    美国的反战歌曲在激励着参加斗争的广大群众。而演唱反战歌曲的歌手们也在斗争中受到了教育，从而加深了他们对现实、对美帝国主义的侵略战争的认识。约翰·芭叶兹在伦敦举行的一次记者招待会上说：“现在，侵略越南的是美国。因此，必须停止侵略的就是美国。说什么‘可怕的共产主义’云云，简直是无聊。没有比那种对轰炸、杀人、焚烧房子和森林感到心满意足更坏的事了。早日停止这样的干法，是最好的事情。越共正在取得胜利。越共进了村子，受到人们的爱戴。因为没有比美国人呆在越南更坏的事情了。……”她说出了千千万万个普通美国人心里的话。  （葵）（附图片）
