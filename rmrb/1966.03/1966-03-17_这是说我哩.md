    "This is talking about me..."
    Shang De
    Many workers and peasants say that reading Chairman Mao's books makes them feel so close, as if Chairman Mao is directly talking to them.
    Li Fuxing, an old poor peasant from Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, who is in his sixties, became enlightened after reading Chairman Mao's books and became "addicted" to them. Once, when he was studying "Combat Liberalism," he read Chairman Mao's criticism of "only wanting organizational care, not organizational discipline." He immediately thought of what he had done in the previous two years and exclaimed, "This is talking about me, this is talking about me!" He was overjoyed and asked his wife, who was cooking, "Chairman Mao has never been to our village, how does he know about my mistake?" He regretted not reading Chairman Mao's books earlier: "If I had read Chairman Mao's books earlier, I wouldn't have made that mistake...."
    What a simple and touching scene! The infinite love of an old poor peasant for Chairman Mao's works and his infinite sincerity in listening to Chairman Mao's teachings leap from the page.
    Chairman Mao's passage was about the general manifestations of liberalism. But this old poor peasant first thought of himself: "This is talking about me!" This may seem like a narrow understanding, but it is actually the most fundamental part of learning Chairman Mao's works well. This old man used to be selfish and "only saw himself, not the collective" two years ago. Since he began studying Chairman Mao's works at the end of 1963, his thinking has greatly changed, and he has made rapid progress. By May of last year, he had become a model who wholeheartedly loved the collective and a vanguard fighter of the proletariat—a Communist Party member.
    Some of our cadres and intellectuals read Chairman Mao's books more than the workers and peasants, so why don't they see results as quickly as the workers and peasants? Why don't they think as clearly as old man Li Fuxing: "This is talking about me!"—the most important reason is this.
    Li Fuxing firmly believes that Chairman Mao's books are the true "scriptures" for the poor and lower-middle peasants to make revolution, are the truth, and every word and sentence makes him feel very close and very moved; we often don't feel as deeply and are not "moved" enough. He "thinks about each sentence as he reads it": "This is talking about me!..." and immediately "puts himself in it"; while we often only think of it as "talking about others." He is so happy to examine himself, happy to make self-revolution, and not afraid of "talking about me"; but we are always afraid of touching our sore spots, covering them up, and unwilling to "reveal" them even though we know they are wrong. He "corrects one fault as soon as he finds it," resolutely acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, without hesitation or ambiguity; but we are often hesitant and not so straightforward.
    In studying Chairman Mao's works, whether or not one can realize "This is talking about me," put oneself in it, and consciously examine oneself and transform oneself, ultimately comes down to the question of whether or not one has a high degree of revolutionary consciousness. Comrade Li Fuxing said: "I read Chairman Mao's books to get rid of my old ideas and to do a good job in revolutionary work." With this strong revolutionary desire, one will definitely be able to master Mao Zedong Thought.

    “这是说我哩……”
    尚德
    许多工农群众说，读毛主席的书，感到多么亲近，常常就象毛主席直接对着自己讲话一样。
    陕西省长安县有个老贫农叫李富兴，六十多岁了，读毛主席的书读的开了窍，上了“瘾”。有一次，他学习《反对自由主义》，读到毛主席批评的“只要组织照顾，不要组织纪律”几句话时，马上联想到自己前两年所做的事，不觉失声叫起来：“这是说我哩，这是说我哩！”他高兴的难以名状，连忙问正在做饭的老伴：“毛主席没到咱村来过，咋知道我这错误？”他后悔读毛主席的书读晚了：“早读毛主席的书，咱就犯不了那错误……。”
    多么纯朴、多么感人的一幅情景啊！一个老贫农无限热爱毛主席著作，倾听毛主席教导的无限诚意，跃然纸上。
    毛主席的那段话，是针对一般自由主义的表现讲的。但这位老贫农却首先想到了自己：“这是说我哩！”这看起来是理解的窄了，实际却是学好毛主席著作的最根本的一环。这个老人两年前私心较重，“只看到自己，看不到集体”，自从一九六三年底开始学习毛主席著作以来，思想大变，进步飞快。到去年五月，他就变成一个一心爱集体的榜样，并且成为一个无产阶级的先锋战士——共产党员了。
    我们有些干部、知识分子，论读毛主席的书比工农群众不少，为什么没有工农群众这样见效快呢？没有象李富兴老人这样明快地想到：“这是说我哩！”——就是最重要的一个原因。
    李富兴坚信毛主席的书是贫下中农闹革命的真“经”，是真理，字字句句都感到非常亲近，非常动心；我们就往往感触不是那么深，“动心”得不够。他是“读一句想一句”：“这是说我哩！……”马上就把自己“摆进去”了；而我们常常只当是“说人家”哩。他是那样乐于检查自己，乐于自我革命，不怕“说我”；而我们却总怕触到自己的痛处，遮着盖着，明知不对，也不肯“亮出来”。他“检查出一条毛病，就改掉一条毛病”，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，毫不迟疑，毫不含糊；而我们却常常是吞吞吐吐，没有那么痛快。
    在学习毛主席著作中，能不能意识到“这是说我”，把自己“摆进去”，自觉地检查自己，改造自己，归根到底是个有无高度的革命自觉性的问题。李富兴同志说：“我念毛主席的书，就是为了去掉自己的旧思想，为了把革命工作搞好。”有了这种强烈的革命愿望，就一定能够把毛泽东思想学到手。
