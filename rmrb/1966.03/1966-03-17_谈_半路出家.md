    Talking about "Changing Careers Mid-Life"
    Shanghai Regional Transportation Company  Zhu Xiaoding

    "Changing careers mid-life" is a phrase some comrades use when explaining their low technical and professional proficiency, carrying a sense of self-deprecation. However, "changing careers mid-life" often restricts some people's thinking, making them afraid to make achievements or be creative.

    In the increase production and practice economy movement, a maintenance workshop innovatively trialed a new spray-painting technique. At first, some people thought: "We 'changed careers mid-life' to learn painting; I'm afraid it won't work!" Later, they studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind, first solving ideological problems, and then overcoming one technical key point after another. After a period of hard work, innovation was finally realized in the hands of these "changed careers mid-life" people.

    Due to the needs of revolution and construction, some comrades will always "change careers" ("leave the home") "mid-life." Is "changing careers mid-life" bad? Not necessarily. "Changing careers mid-life" can often prevent us from carrying or lessen the burden of "baggage" (such as complacent emotions of thinking we "have the skills," "have the ability," and carrying certain "old frameworks," etc.); "changing careers mid-life" can also prompt us to diligently learn from the advanced, make up for the shortcomings of "changing careers mid-life," and catch up.

    What is important is that you must not have the idea in your head that, since you've "changed careers mid-life," you can forgive yourself and relax.

    People's mastery and familiarity with objective laws always has a development process from shallow to deep. This requires daring to practice and being good at practicing. Through practice, understanding, then more practice, more understanding, we continuously improve our understanding of objective things. "Changing careers mid-life" doesn't matter; as long as we work hard and don't stop after scratching the surface, this process of understanding can be accelerated.

    Therefore, don't be afraid of "changing careers mid-life"; be afraid of "turning back mid-life."

### 谈“半路出家”

    谈“半路出家”
    上海市地区运输公司　朱肖鼎
    “半路出家”，是有些同志在说明自己技术、业务水平低时用的一句话，带有自谦的意思。但是，“半路出家”往往也束缚了一些人的思想，使他们不敢有所作为，有所创造。
    在增产节约运动中，一个保修车间革新试用一种新的喷漆技术。开始时有人这么想：“我们是‘半路出家’改行学漆工的，怕不行吧！”后来他们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，先解决思想问题，接着攻下一个个技术关键。经过一段时间的努力，在这些“半路出家”的人手里，终于实现了革新。
    由于革命和建设的需要，有些同志“半路”改变工种（“出家”）的情形总是会有的。“半路出家”不好吗？不见得。“半路出家”往往可以使我们不背或少背“包袱”（比如自以为“有一手”、“有水平”的自满情绪和带着某些“老框框”等等）；“半路出家”还可以促使我们努力向先进学习，补“半路出家”之不足，迎头赶上。
    要紧的是，脑袋里千万不能有一个反正“半路出家”就原谅自己、放松自己的想法。
    人们掌握和熟悉客观规律，总有一个从浅到深的发展过程。这就要敢于实践和善于实践，通过实践，认识，再实践，再认识，不断提高对客观事物的认识。“半路出家”不要紧，只要积极努力，不是浅尝辄止，是可以加速这个认识过程的。
    所以，不怕“半路出家”，怕的是“半路回头”。
