    Ancient History Workers Must Also Go to the Countryside
    《Historical Monthly》Editor Gao Min
    Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently emphasized that intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants.  Marxism should be learned not only from books, but more importantly from practice. Intellectuals should step out of their studies and classrooms, go to the countryside, go to factories, go to stores, go to military units, participate with workers, peasants, and soldiers in class struggle and production struggle, earnestly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and return covered in mud.  Only in this way can Marxism learned from books be transformed into one's own, and only then can relatively complete knowledge be obtained.  After many philosophy and social science workers and university liberal arts teachers and students went to the countryside, their ideology and feelings changed, and they had a relatively correct view of some confused thoughts and strange theories existing in academic circles.  The following articles are good proof of this.
    Summary: Ancient history workers must go to the countryside to truly transform their thinking. By deepening their feelings for the working people and understanding and becoming familiar with the peasants, I further realized that the so-called peasant class in history had no revolutionary nature and that the so-called feudal landlord class implemented "concession policies" are extremely absurd. At the same time, going to the countryside also helps ancient history workers understand ancient historical materials.
    Whether it is necessary for ancient history research to face the countryside seems to be not without ideological obstacles. Some people may have this view: the research of ancient history mainly relies on documentary materials. If you go to the countryside, you will not be able to conduct research at all; at the same time, peasants do not urgently need ancient history; therefore, the issue of historical science facing the countryside and serving the peasants seems to have little to do with those engaged in ancient history work. If there is such a view, I think it is incorrect. Here, I would like to talk about some of my superficial experiences.
    Do peasants need ancient history? It is definitely needed. Many historical stories about ancient times are circulating in the countryside, and they are often mixed with superstition. This situation shows that the peasant masses love ancient history, and it also shows that we need to write ancient historical stories from a new perspective, cleanse the poison of feudal superstition, and fight to win the vast ideological front in the countryside. What's more, fundamentally speaking, to truly restore a history of China to the history of the working people, to restore the original appearance of the working people, and to liberate history from the genealogy of emperors, generals, and ministers, includes ancient history! So, how can we say that peasants do not need ancient history, and that ancient history cannot face the countryside and serve the peasants?
    If we focus on how to study ancient history well, then comrades engaged in ancient history work, in particular, need to face the countryside and go to the countryside to complete this task.
    We know that history, since the emergence of classes, is only a history of class struggle. Without the historical truth of class struggle, there is no history. So, can we imagine that a person who has not established a class viewpoint can study ancient history? It is undoubtedly fundamentally impossible. Where does our class viewpoint come from? Does it fall from the sky? Of course not. Class viewpoints can only come from the study of Chairman Mao's works, the study of Marxism-Leninism, and the practice of participating in revolutionary struggle, and mainly the latter. Because only through one's own practice can one understand and master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, going to the countryside, practicing three togethers with poor and lower-middle peasants, participating in class struggle, understanding and becoming familiar with peasants, and cultivating the class feelings of the working people are of inestimable significance for the establishment of class viewpoints and the correction of positions and methods. As a historian, especially an ancient history worker who deals with books more often, the first thing to do is to learn this lesson well.
    From a personal point of view, the ideological feelings before and after going to the countryside are different. Before going to the countryside, I had seen many articles written by Sun Zuomin and others that slandered the peasant class in history. They said that peasants developed a "tolerant and obedient character" and did not dare to stand up and fight; even if they revolted, they wanted to "become rich people, landlords, and officials, climb into the circle of the ruling class, and become emperors"; generally speaking, peasants have the idea of "getting rich"; peasants "do not have their own ideological weapons," and after the victory of the uprising, they cannot establish their own political power, and even if they establish it, it is a feudal political power. There are many such things. In a word, in the writings of Sun Zuomin and others, the peasant class in history is a mob, a backward group, with no revolutionary nature. I had long noticed the errors of these arguments, and I had considered writing articles to refute them at the time, but I always couldn't muster the courage, fearing that it would take up time, and thought it would be better to study more historical materials, so I delayed again and again, and never wrote anything. Instead, I was writing articles such as "A Study on the Establishment Date of Pingqi Prefecture in the Northern Wei Dynasty." After participating in the socialist education movement twice, because I spent almost a year living, working, and struggling with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I personally saw the noble character and the heroic image of the poor and lower-middle peasants who dared to make revolution and dared to fight, thus greatly strengthening my love and admiration for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and my own feelings for the working people also deepened. At this time, when I looked back at my attitude before going to the countryside, I was shocked, and I couldn't wait to write articles to refute the fallacies of Sun Zuomin and others. Through the image of today's poor and lower-middle peasants, I also seem to have seen the working people in history. Therefore, I am particularly interested in the research and study of peasant uprisings in history; my understanding of the essence of the "concession policy" adopted by the landlord class after the peasant uprising is also a step deeper than before. On this basis, I wrote an article criticizing the "concession policy theory." At this time, I no longer felt that I was wasting time. On the contrary, after criticizing these erroneous views, I felt as if I had vented a grievance in my heart. These small changes in me before and after going to the countryside prove this truth: to study and research ancient history, we must also go to the countryside, cultivate our own feelings for the working people, understand and become familiar with peasants, and then we can understand the history of ancient peasants.
    A person who studies ancient history should not only go to the countryside to exercise his position, views, and methods, but also participate in the sorting and research of the family history, village history, and commune history of the peasants. This is because both ancient history and modern history are histories of class struggle. The ancient class struggle has long passed. If we want to study it, we cannot rely on microscopes or computers. Therefore, to form a real sense of class struggle, to understand and reveal the ancient class struggle thoroughly and with flesh and blood, it is not enough to just sit on the pile of ancient historical materials and dig around, but we must go to the real, living battlefield of class struggle, to personally participate in the battle, to form a rich real sense of class struggle, and then use it to guide the study and research of ancient class struggle. Marx said in the "Introduction to A Critique of Political Economy": "Human anatomy is the key to ape anatomy." According to the same principle, studying the class struggle in modern and contemporary times is also a key to studying the class struggle in ancient times.
    I also have some feelings about this. For example, for many years, the theory of "concession policy" has been popular in the historical circles. Because I lacked practical experience in class struggle, I believed in this theory. And I wrote "A Tentative Discussion on the Development Stages of Peasant Uprisings and Peasant Wars in China's Feudal Society" in 1960 (published in Guangming Daily on September 15 of the same year), in which there was a paragraph mentioning the "concession measures" of the landlord class. Later, although I gradually became somewhat skeptical of this theory, it was not until I participated in the rural socialist education movement twice that I deeply felt the error of this theory. The reason is that in the countryside, I heard many poor and lower-middle peasants tell of the class bitterness before liberation. The actual situation at that time was this: whenever a peasant stood up to fight, the landlord class always tried every means to counterattack, and even if they took back all the fruits of victory that the peasants had achieved in the struggle, they would not give up. The situation of the struggle between peasants and landlords' "Returning Home Corps" during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War was particularly obvious. In countless examples, I have not seen any concessions from the landlord class. Since the situation of the struggle between peasants and landlords in modern and contemporary times is like this, why would the landlords in feudal society make concessions to the peasants again and again? So, my suspicion deepened, and when I turned around to consider the theory of "concession policy" again, I felt its error and fiction, and thus had the courage and possibility to write articles criticizing the "concession policy theory."
    Even for the understanding of ancient historical materials, going to the countryside to widely contact reality is of great help. I have also tasted some sweetness in this regard. For example, I used to have a lot of trouble understanding the clan parties and clan relations in feudal society. After going to the countryside, you will encounter examples everywhere of clan relations covering up class contradictions, which will help you understand the clan relations in feudal society. For example, I went to the Hui County and Xiuwu area for investigation and learned that there were rice paddies in this area very early, so I wrote the article "Rice Production in Northern Henan in Ancient Times," which was able to explain some historical phenomena. There are many similar examples. The only purpose of my saying this is to hope to encourage and seek advice from comrades who study and research ancient history!

### 古代史工作者也必须到农村去

    古代史工作者也必须到农村去
    《史学月刊》编辑　高敏
    编者按：毛泽东同志一贯强调：知识分子要同工农群众结合。对于马克思主义，不仅要从书本中学习，更重要的是在实践中学习。知识分子要从书斋和课堂中走出来，到农村去，到工厂去，到商店去，到连队去，同工农兵一起参加阶级斗争和生产斗争，认真向工农兵学习，滚一身泥巴回来。这样，才能把从书本上学来的马克思主义变成自己的东西，才能取得比较完全的知识。许多哲学社会科学工作者、大学文科师生下乡以后，使自己的思想感情起了变化，对学术界存在的一些混乱思想和怪论，有了比较正确的看法。今天发表的这几篇文章，就是很好的证明。
    提要　古代史工作者必须到农村中去，才能使自己的思想得到真正的改造。由于加深了劳动人民的思想感情，了解和熟悉了农民，我进一步认识到所谓历史上农民阶级没有什么革命性，所谓封建地主阶级实行过“让步政策”，都是极端荒谬的。同时，到农村中去还有助于古史工作者对古代史料的了解。
    研究古代史需要不需要面向农村，看来并不是毫无思想障碍的。可能有人是这样的看法：古代史的研究，主要是靠文献资料，如果到农村去，就根本无法进行研究；同时，农民并不迫切需要古代史；所以，历史科学面向农村、为农民服务的问题，似乎与从事古代史工作的人关系不大。假如真有这种看法，我认为是不正确的。在这里，我想谈一点个人的肤浅体会。
    农民需不需要古代史呢？肯定是需要的。农村中流传着许多关于古代的历史故事，而且往往与迷信杂拌在一块。这样的情况，既表明农民群众对于古代历史是爱好的，又表明我们有必要用新的观点去编写古代的历史故事，去清洗封建的迷信的毒素，为争夺农村的广大思想阵地而斗争。何况从根本上来说，要把一部中国史真正还原为劳动人民的历史，恢复劳动人民的本来面貌，把历史从帝王将相的家谱里解放出来，也包括古代史在内哩！那么，怎么能够说，农民不需要古代史以及古代史不能面向农村、为农民服务呢？
    如果从如何才能研究好古代史的角度着眼，则从事古史工作的同志，尤其有必要面向农村，到农村中去，才能完成这一任务。
    我们知道，历史，自有阶级以来，只是一部阶级斗争史。离开了阶级斗争的历史真实，就无所谓历史。那么，可不可以设想，一个没有树立起阶级观点的人，能研究古代史呢？无疑是根本不可能的。我们的阶级观点是从什么地方来的呢？是天上掉下来的吗？当然不是。阶级观点，只可能来源于毛主席著作的学习、马克思列宁主义的学习和参与革命斗争的实践，而且主要是后者。因为，只有通过自己的实践，才能理解和掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。所以，到农村中去，和贫下中农实行三同，参加阶级斗争，了解和熟悉农民，培养劳动人民的阶级感情，对于阶级观点的树立和立场、方法的端正，有着无可估量的作用与意义。作为一个史学工作者，特别是和书本打交道比较多的古代史工作者来说，首先需要学好这一课。
    以个人的感受来说，下乡前与下乡后的思想感情，是有所不同的。下乡之前，我曾看到过孙祚民等人写过不少污蔑历史上农民阶级的文章。说什么农民养成了“容忍顺从的性格”，不敢起来斗争；即使起义了，也是想“变成富人、地主、官吏，爬进统治阶级的圈子里去，作起皇帝来”；一般说来，农民有
  “发家致富”的思想；农民“没有自己的思想武器”，起义胜利后不能建立自己的政权，即使建立了也是封建性政权。诸如此类，不一而足。一言以蔽之，在孙祚民等人的笔下，历史上的农民阶级是群氓，是落后群，没有什么革命性。对于这些论调的错误，我早就察觉到了，当时也曾考虑过写文章驳斥，但总是鼓不起勇气，怕耽误时间，认为不如多啃点史料来得实在，以致一拖再拖，始终没有提笔，相反地，却在大写什么《北魏平齐郡的设置年代考》等文章。通过两度参加社会主义教育运动以后，由于差不多一年的时间，和贫下中农在一起生活、劳动和斗争，我亲眼看到了贫下中农身上的崇高品德和敢于革命敢于斗争的英雄形象，从而对贫下中农的热爱和敬慕，大大加强了，自己的劳动人民情感也加深了。这时，我再回过头来看看自己下乡前的态度，不觉为之大吃一惊，恨不能立即写文章驳斥孙祚民等人的谬论。通过今天的贫下中农的形象，我也好象看到了历史上的劳动人民。因此，对历史上农民起义的研究和学习，也格外感兴趣了；对农民起义后地主阶级当权派采取的什么“让步政策”的实质的认识，也比前加深了一步。就在这个基础上，我写了一篇批判“让步政策论”的文章。这时，我再也不感到耽误时间了，恰恰相反，在批判了这些错误观点之后，心里感到出了一口怨气似的。我在下乡前后的这些微小的变化，证明了这样一条真理：学习和研究古代史，也必须到农村中去，培养自己的劳动人民的情感，去了解和熟悉农民，然后才能理解古代农民的历史。
    一个学古代史的人，不仅应当到农村中去锻炼自己的立场、观点和方法，而且要参加农民的家史、村史和社史的整理与研究。这是因为，不论古代史和近现代史，都是阶级斗争史。而古代的阶级斗争早已成为过去，我们要去研究它，既不能靠显微镜，也用不上计算机。因此，要形成阶级斗争的实感，要把古代的阶级斗争理解透彻和揭示得有血有肉，光凭坐在古史料堆上扒来扒去是不行的，而必须到现实的、活生生的阶级斗争的战场上，去亲身参加战斗，去形成阶级斗争的丰富实感，然后用之去指导古代阶级斗争的学习与研究。马克思在《政治经济学批判》导言里说过：“人体解剖对于猴体解剖是一把钥匙。”按照同样的道理，研究近代和现代的阶级斗争，对于研究古代的阶级斗争也是一把钥匙。
    关于这一点，我也有一点感受。例如多年来，史学界流行“让步政策”的理论。我由于缺乏阶级斗争实际经验，也就相信了这种理论。并曾在一九六○年写了《试论我国封建社会农民起义和农民战争的发展阶段问题》（刊于同年九月十五日《光明日报》），其中就有一段提到什么地主阶级的“让步措施”。后来我虽然也逐渐对这一理论发生了一些怀疑，但是直到通过两度参加农村社会主义教育运动，我才深感这一理论的错误。原因就在于我在农村中，听到了许多贫下中农诉述解放前的阶级苦。当时的实况是这样：每当一次农民起来斗争之后，地主阶级总是千方百计地进行反扑，即使把农民在斗争中取得的胜利果实全部夺回去了，也不罢休。第三次国内革命战争时期农民与地主的“还乡团”斗争的情况，则尤为明显。在无数的实例中，我没有看到任何一次有什么地主阶级的让步。既然近现代农民与地主斗争的情况是如此，为什么封建社会的地主却会一次又一次地向农民让步呢？于是，我的怀疑加深了，我回头来再考虑“让步政策”的理论，就感觉到了它的错误与虚构，从而也有了勇气与可能写出批判“让步政策论”的文章。
    即使对于古代史料的理解来说，到农村中去广泛接触实际，也是大有帮助的。在这方面，我也尝到了一些甜头。例如对封建社会宗党及宗族关系的理解，我曾颇伤脑筋。到农村以后，你会到处遇到宗族关系掩盖阶级矛盾的实例，从而对于理解封建社会的宗族关系有所帮助。又如我到辉县、修武一带作了调查，知道这一带很早就有水稻田，因此便写出了《古代豫北的水稻生产》一文，对某些历史现象能够作出了一些解释。同样的例子还很多。我之所以说这些，目的只有一个：希望跟学习与研究古代史的同志共勉，并求得教益！
