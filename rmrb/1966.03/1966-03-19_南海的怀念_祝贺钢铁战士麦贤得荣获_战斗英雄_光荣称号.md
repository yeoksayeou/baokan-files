	Remembering the South China Sea
	--Congratulations to Steel Warrior Mai Xiande on Receiving the Glorious Title of "Combat Hero"
	Cheng Guangrui
	An old man, draped in sunlight, filled with morning breeze, stands in the south of the motherland, gazing at the earth and the sky. Sunlight sprinkles his blue clothes, watching golden waves surge; morning breeze blows his white hair, watching waves soar. He is so solemn, yet cannot hide the excitement in his heart, as if recalling, as if contemplating, as if reciting:
	Child, do you remember my name, do you recognize it clearly? I am the South China Sea, you were born in my embrace. I know you, generation after generation, just as poor, for generations paddling broken fishing boats, struggling to make a living on the sea. I remember, your grandfather and father, dreaming day and night, when will they be able to break free from the shackles of poverty? This day has finally come, the great banner reflects the red waves, tigers and wolves flee in panic, heroes board red warships. I saw you grow up under the red flag, feathers gradually full, saw you shoulder a gun and enlist in the army, embarking on a new journey.
	On the day of enlistment, comrades asked who was so unfamiliar: "Mai Xiande, a new recruit in the revolutionary ranks!" In the morning light, you practiced bayonet drills, practiced "seeing red with bayonets," your brave shouts reverberating on my waves. Under the moonlight, you read "Selected Works of Mao," cultivating solid ideology, I quietly listened, even I felt young listening.
	Warrior, I understand you, you have the personality of the sea, the will of crashing waves, a mind that embraces heaven and earth. Warrior, I love you, you have the passion of a raging fire, you give your whole heart to the people, for the sake of world revolution.
	I clearly remember, that night before dawn, the heroic naval vessel was patrolling, loaded with a ship full of stars. Suddenly an enemy situation was discovered, I only heard an order, a fierce battle began, cannons thundering. The heroic vessel is like a fierce tiger, charging through the waves, the warriors' eyes burning with anger, their hearts boiling with hatred. A shrapnel hit your right forehead, blood staining your chest red, but you continued to fight, persisting until a great victory. Those three hours, how tenacious, how heroic, the steel will, made ghosts and gods weep, made heaven and earth marvel! I have never seen such tenacity, such heroism, I use three thousand feet of white hair, ten thousand years of history to testify.
	Warrior—hero, please allow me to ask you one question: what made your bones so hard, your heart so red? I suddenly recalled you studying hard by the sea, reading aloud under the moonlight, Mao Zedong Thought armed you, making you invincible. I suddenly recalled you practicing hard "seeing red with bayonets" by the sea, Mao Zedong Thought armed you, fearless of tigers and wolves showing off their ferocity.
	Today the people give you the glorious title: Combat Hero, making me, this old man, feel proud, feel honored. Child, may you recover your health soon, return to my embrace, board the heroic naval vessel again, advance towards the sun, riding the waves and wind!

    南海的怀念
    ——祝贺钢铁战士麦贤得荣获“战斗英雄”光荣称号
    程光锐一位老人，披一身阳光，满襟晨风，站在祖国南方，眼望着大地和苍穹。阳光洒满他蓝色衣衫，看金波翻涌；晨风吹动他苍苍白发，看浪花飞腾。他那样壮严，又掩不住心中的激动，仿佛在回忆，在沉思，又仿佛在吟诵：孩子，我的名字你可记得起，认得清？我就是南海，你就在我的怀中诞生。我可认识你呢，祖祖辈辈，一样贫穷，几代人驾着破渔船，在海上挣扎谋生。我记得，你的祖父和父亲，昼思夜梦，什么时候啊，能够挣脱贫穷的缰绳？这一天终于来了，大旗把波澜映红，虎狼仓惶逃窜，英雄登上红色舰艇。我看见你在红旗下长大，羽毛渐丰，看见你扛起枪入了伍，踏上新的途程。入伍那天，战友们问那是谁这样陌生：“麦贤得，革命队伍里的一名新兵！”晨光中，你练刺杀，练“刺刀见红”，你勇敢的喊声，在我的波浪上奔腾。月光下，你读“毛选”，练思想过硬，我静静地倾听，听了连我也感到年青。战士，我了解你，你有大海样的个性，有惊涛裂岸的意志，包容天地的心胸。战士，我喜爱你，你有烈火般的豪情，你掏尽红心为人民，为了世界革命。我清楚地记得，那天夜未央，天未明，海上英雄艇在巡逻，满载着一船星星。忽然发现了敌情，我只听一声命令，一场激烈的战斗开始了，炮声雷鸣。英雄艇象一只猛虎，波浪里陷阵冲锋，战士们眼里怒火燃烧，胸中仇恨沸腾。弹片打伤你的右额，鲜血染红前胸，可是你继续战斗，坚持到大获全胜。那三个钟头啊，何等顽强，何等英勇，钢铁的意志啊，使鬼神泣，使天地惊！我从来未见过，这样顽强，这样英勇，我用三千丈白发、一万年历史来作证。战士——英雄，请容我问你一声：是什么使你骨头这样硬，心这样红？我猛忆起你海边苦读，月下琅琅书声，毛泽东思想武装了你，使你战无不胜。我猛忆起你海边苦练“刺刀见红”，毛泽东思想武装着你，不怕虎狼逞凶。今天人民赠给你光荣称号：战斗英雄，使我这老人也感到自豪，感到光荣。孩子，愿你早日恢复健康，回到我的怀中，再登上英雄艇，迎着朝阳前进，破浪乘风！
