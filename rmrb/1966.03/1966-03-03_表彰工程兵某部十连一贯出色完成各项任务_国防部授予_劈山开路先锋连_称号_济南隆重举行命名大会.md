    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd) The Ministry of National Defense recently issued an order to award the 10th Company of a certain Engineering Corps unit of the Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with the honorary title of "Pioneering Company for Splitting Mountains and Opening Roads."
    The order said that the 10th Company of a certain Engineering Corps unit, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's writings, gives prominence to politics, adheres to the Four Firsts, carries forward the Three-Eight Work Style, and attaches importance to fundamentally improving political consciousness. The troops have red ideology and a tough work style. Since 1950, they have been working for a long time in the Kangzang Plateau, coastal islands and remote mountainous areas, drilling through mountains and chiseling rocks, opening mountains and splitting ridges, taking hardship as glory, not afraid of difficulties and dangers, and excellently completing various tasks assigned by the superiors.
    The order said that the current U.S. imperialism is intensifying its war of aggression in Asia. It is hoped that you will be a hundred times more vigilant, further highlight politics, implement the "Four Goods," strengthen war preparedness, and strive to better complete all the tasks assigned by the Party and the state.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd) The leading organs of the Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army solemnly held a naming ceremony in Jinan on the 1st. According to the order of the Ministry of National Defense, the honorary title of "Pioneering Company for Splitting Mountains and Opening Roads" was awarded to the 10th Company of a certain Engineering Corps unit of the Jinan Military Region.
    Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Region, and First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, Bai Rubing, Governor of Shandong Province, Zhang Renchu, Fu Jiaxuan, He Zhucheng, responsible persons of the Jinan Military Region, and the heads of various units of the army, navy, and air force stationed in the Jinan area and representatives of the Four-Good Companies, more than 2,100 people attended the conference.
    At the meeting, Zhang Renchu, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, read out the order to award the 10th Company of a certain Engineering Corps unit of the Jinan Military Region with the title of "Pioneering Company for Splitting Mountains and Opening Roads," and on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, presented a silk banner embroidered with seven golden characters of "Pioneering Company for Splitting Mountains and Opening Roads" to the representatives of the 10th Company.
    Tan Qilong spoke at the meeting. He praised the great achievements made by the 10th Company in the construction of the Kangzang Highway and the execution of national defense construction and other tasks in the sixteen years since the establishment of the company; praised the lofty communist morality of the comrades of the 10th Company who cherish the revolution, take hardship as glory, are completely selfless, and wholeheartedly serve the revolution, and the hard-bone spirit of not fearing heaven and not fearing the earth and advancing in the face of difficulties. He said that the most fundamental reason why the 10th Company can have red ideology, a tough work style, and consistently and excellently complete various tasks is that they always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, give prominence to politics, adhere to the Four Firsts, carry forward the Three-Eight Work Style, and implement the Three Great Democracies, fundamentally strengthening the construction of the company. He hoped that all the companies in the Jinan area, the people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province will earnestly learn from the 10th Company, learn from their thorough revolutionary spirit, better complete all the tasks assigned by the Party and the people, and better complete the country's various plans.

We must learn from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Jiao Yulu, learn from heroic companies, be willing to be the "old oxen" of the people, and vow to be the "volunteer soldiers" of communism, and use new and greater achievements to answer the care and expectations of the Party and the people.

    新华社二日讯　国防部最近发布命令，授予中国人民解放军济南部队工程兵某部十连以“劈山开路先锋连”光荣称号。
    命令说，工程兵某部十连，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，重视从根本上提高政治觉悟。部队思想红，作风硬。自一九五○年以来，长期在康藏高原、沿海岛屿和偏僻山区进行施工，穿山凿石，开山劈岭，以艰苦为荣，不怕艰险困难，出色地完成了上级交给的各项任务。
    命令说，当前美帝国主义正在亚洲加紧扩大侵略战争，望你们百倍警惕，进一步突出政治，落实四好，加强战备，为更好地完成党和国家交给的一切任务而努力。
    据新华社济南二日电　中国人民解放军济南部队领导机关一日在济南隆重举行命名大会，根据国防部命令，授予济南部队工程兵某部十连以“劈山开路先锋连”的光荣称号。
    中共中央华东局书记处书记、济南部队第一政治委员、中共山东省委第一书记谭启龙，山东省省长白如冰，济南部队负责人张仁初、傅家选、何柱成，以及驻济南地区陆海空军部队各单位的负责人和四好连队代表等两千一百多人，出席了大会。
    会上，张仁初代表国防部宣读了授予济南部队工程兵某部十连以“劈山开路先锋连”称号的命令，并代表国防部把一面绣着“劈山开路先锋连”七个金色大字的锦旗授给十连的代表。
    谭启龙在会上讲话。他赞扬十连建连十六年来，在建筑康藏公路、执行国防施工等各项任务中所取得的伟大成绩；赞扬十连同志以革命为怀，以艰苦为荣，毫不利己，一心为革命的高尚的共产主义品德和天不怕，地不怕，迎着困难前进的硬骨头精神。他说，十连所以能够思想红、作风硬、一贯出色地完成各项任务，最根本的原因，是他们始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，实行三大民主，从根本上加强了连队建设。他希望济南地区所有连队、全省的人民公社和工矿企业都认真地向十连学习，学习他们的彻底革命精神，更好地完成党和人民交给的一切任务，更好地完成国家的各项计划。

    “劈山开路先锋连”指导员袁昌凌代表全连在会上表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地突出政治，把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，把活学活用毛主席著作当作自己毕生的战斗任务。要向雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄学习，向英雄连队学习，甘当人民的“老黄牛”，誓作共产主义的“义务兵”，以新的更大的成绩，来回答党和人民的关怀与期望。
