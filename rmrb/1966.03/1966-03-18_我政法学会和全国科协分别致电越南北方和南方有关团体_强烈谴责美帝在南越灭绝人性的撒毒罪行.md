    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th. The China Political Science and Law Society and the China Association for Science and Technology today strongly condemned the US Johnson administration for using poison gas and chemical agents on a large scale and repeatedly in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The China Political Science and Law Society pointed out that such heinous war crimes by the Johnson administration show that the US imperialist robber chieftain headed by Johnson is the most brutal war criminal of our time, and he will absolutely not escape the punishment of justice. The National Science and Technology Association pointed out that the US imperialists' crimes of abusing scientific achievements and desecrating human dignity are even worse than the heinous crimes of Hitler and Tojo Hideki in the past.
    The Political Science and Law Society and the National Science and Technology Association made the above strong condemnations of US imperialism today in telegrams sent to the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, the Vietnam Lawyers Association, and the Vietnam Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology for the 16th anniversary of the "March 19th" Vietnam National Anti-American Struggle Day and the "Week of Supporting the Vietnamese People."
    The telegram from the Political Science and Law Society stated that the Johnson administration, in its war of aggression against Vietnam, has used poison gas and chemical agents on a large scale and repeatedly, causing tens of thousands of Vietnamese people, including women and children, to be poisoned, disabled, and killed, and causing damage to crops and plants in large areas. Such inhuman and heinous crimes are the most blatant and barbaric violations of modern universally recognized principles of international law and a reckless trampling on the "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare," jointly signed by many countries in the world in 1925. It fully exposes the ferocious and vicious aggressive nature of US imperialism and completely exposes the hypocritical face of the Johnson administration playing the "peace talks" trick. The telegram pointed out that Chinese legal workers, together with the Chinese people, resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US aggression and for national salvation, vow to be the backing of the Vietnamese people, and fight to the end with the Vietnamese people to completely drive out the American aggressors.
    The telegram from the National Science and Technology Association pointed out that this heinous crime of US imperialism is a serious provocation to the people of the world and to just scientific workers all over the world, arousing great anger among Chinese scientific workers.
    The telegram from the National Science and Technology Association stated that Chinese scientific and technological workers wholeheartedly express their admiration and pay high tribute to the heroic behavior of the Vietnamese people in daring to struggle and daring to win, and to the spirit of patriotism and internationalism reflected in the struggle. The telegram also expressed firm belief that the final victory of the war will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

    我政法学会和全国科协分别致电越南北方和南方有关团体
    强烈谴责美帝在南越灭绝人性的撒毒罪行
    新华社十七日讯　中国政治法律学会和中华人民共和国科学技术协会，今天强烈谴责美国约翰逊政府在侵略越南战争中大规模地多次地使用毒气和化学毒品。中国政治法律学会指出，约翰逊政府这种滔天的战争罪行表明，以约翰逊为首的美帝国主义强盗头子是当代最残暴的战争罪犯，它绝对逃脱不了正义的惩罚。全国科协指出，美帝国主义这种滥用科学成果、冒凟人类尊严的罪行，比起过去希特勒和东条英机的滔天罪行有过之而无不及。
    政法学会和全国科协今天是在为“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十六周年和“声援越南人民周”分别发给越南南方民族解放阵线、越南法律工作者协会和越南科学技术普及协会的电报中，向美帝国主义提出上述强烈谴责的。
    政法学会的电报说，约翰逊政府在它侵略越南的战争中大规模地多次地使用毒气和化学毒品，使数以万计的越南人民、包括妇女和儿童中毒、残废和死亡，使大片地区的庄稼和植物遭到损坏。这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，是对现代公认的国际法准则最粗暴、最野蛮的破坏，是对一九二五年由世界上许多国家共同签订的“关于禁止使用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”的肆无忌惮的践踏。它充分地暴露了美帝国主义穷凶极恶的侵略本性，彻底戳穿了约翰逊政府玩弄“和谈”骗局的伪善面目。电报指出，中国法律工作者和中国人民一道，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，誓作越南人民的后盾，同越南人民一起，为彻底赶走美国侵略者而奋斗到底。
    全国科协在电报中指出，美帝国主义的这一滔天罪行，是对全世界人民、全世界正义的科学工作者的严重挑衅，激起了中国科学工作者的极大愤怒。
    全国科协的电报说，中国科学技术工作者对越南人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄行为和在斗争中所体现出的爱国主义和国际主义精神，衷心表示钦佩并致崇高的敬意。电报中还表示坚信，战争的最后胜利必将属于英雄的越南人民。
