    Emphasize Politics, Recognize the Direction, Rely on the Masses, Combine Hot and Cold
    Consolidate and Improve Gengdu Primary Schools and Agricultural Middle Schools
    The Ministry of Education Instructs All Regions to Develop and Consolidate Simultaneously, and Advance Steadily and Solidly
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Ministry of Education recently issued instructions, requiring all regions to firmly grasp the consolidation and improvement of Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools in rural areas.
    The instructions stated that since the National Rural Part-Farming Part-Study Education Conference, Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools have greatly developed, with diverse forms of schooling, and various regions have created new experiences. The face of rural education has been renewed, and the entire education front presents an excellent situation. This is the result of the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership of party committees at all levels, and the efforts of the broad masses and cadres. Under this excellent situation, we must view our work with a "one divides into two" approach, seeing both the achievements we have made and the shortcomings and problems that exist. Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools are new things, and the emergence of some shortcomings and problems is inevitable, but the leadership must be clear-headed and seriously address the problems that have already emerged. We must not be satisfied with the existing achievements and relax the consolidation and improvement of Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools.
    The instructions put forward five points of opinion on doing a good job in consolidation and improvement, requiring all regions to study and implement them based on the actual conditions of their regions. These five points are:
    1.  We must emphasize politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement the Party's education policy, widely and deeply publicize the Party Central Committee's instructions on the two labor systems and the two education systems, so that the broad masses of cadres and people, especially educators, recognize the great significance of running part-farming part-study and part-work part-study education, clarify the direction of schooling, inspire revolutionary enthusiasm, and enhance confidence in their work. In the face of an excellent situation, don't let your heads get hot, be a calm promoter; when encountering difficulties, don't waver, recognize the direction, and persevere to the end. Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools must follow the requirements of developing while consolidating, developing a batch, and consolidating a batch, and do their work realistically and solidly, and advance steadily.
    2.  We must adhere to the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, combining leadership with the masses. Discuss matters with the masses, and be good at transforming the Party's policies into conscious and voluntary actions of the masses. Some places have not fully mobilized the masses in the process of running schools, have not proceeded from the actual situation, have made excessively high and urgent demands, and have taken the wrong approach of simple administrative orders, which should be seriously checked and corrected. The consolidation and improvement of Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools, as well as the establishment of new schools, must proceed from the actual situation of the local area, adapt to local conditions, adapt to the times, adapt to people, and be diverse. We cannot demand uniformity. A Gengdu primary school can have different types of classes, and a class can have different types of groups and people, conducting multi-grade teaching. Agricultural middle schools must adhere to part-farming part-study, and properly arrange production labor and study time. In short, it should adapt to the needs of the local people, adapt to the needs of local production, and serve the three great revolutionary movements.
    3.  We must adhere to the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily. Learn the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, rely on our own efforts, strive for self-improvement, work hard, and run schools diligently and thriftily. Truly reduce the economic burden on the state, collectives, and student families. The leadership should care about the lives of teachers. The teachers' salary and benefits should be resolved reasonably through democratic discussions among the commune members and truly implemented.
    4.  We must establish a revolutionary and laborized teaching force. First, we must organize teachers to study Chairman Mao's works, work hard on the application of these works, and regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for our work. At present, we should also lead teachers to learn from Chairman Mao's good student, Comrade Jiao Yulu, and learn from Comrades Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Ouyang Hai, etc., establish a revolutionary outlook on life, establish the idea of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, and willingly be "volunteers" for part-farming part-study education. Second, teachers must insist on participating in production labor and implement part-farming part-teaching. Third, teachers must frequently go deep into reality, closely contact the masses, and constantly improve their political and cultural level, and constantly improve teaching and improve teaching quality. Fourth, Gengdu primary and agricultural middle school teachers can be linked with nearby full-time primary and middle schools, and under the guidance of the Party's education policy, learn from each other, promote each other, learn from each other's strengths, and improve together.
    5.  We must rely on the leadership of the Party. Educational administrative departments at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party committee, rely on the broad masses, cooperate with relevant departments, frequently go deep into reality, stay at selected points for investigation and research, summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner, establish models, and drive the overall situation. Whether it is the educational administrative department or the school, they must regularly and proactively report the situation to the local Party committee, put forward opinions on the work, ask the Party committee for instructions, and act in accordance with the instructions of the Party committee, so that Gengdu primary schools and agricultural middle schools can be continuously consolidated and developed.

    突出政治，认清方向，依靠群众，热冷结合
    巩固提高耕读小学和农业中学
    教育部指示各地边发展，边巩固，扎扎实实地稳步前进
    新华社八日讯  教育部最近发出指示，要求各地抓紧农村中耕读小学和农业中学的巩固提高工作。
    指示中说，全国农村半农半读教育会议以后，耕读小学和农业中学有了很大发展，办学形式多种多样，各地都创造了一些新的经验。农村教育面貌为之一新，整个教育战线呈现出一派大好形势。这是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在各级党委领导下，依靠广大群众和干部努力的结果。在这一大好形势下，要一分为二地看待工作，既要看到取得的成绩，又要看到存在的缺点和问题。耕读小学和农业中学是新生事物，出现一些缺点和问题是难免的，但是领导上要清醒，认真地对待已经出现的问题。千万不能满足于现有的成绩，而放松对耕读小学和农业中学的巩固提高工作。
    指示中提出做好巩固提高工作的五点意见，要求各地根据本地区的实际情况研究执行。这五点意见是：
    一、必须突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行党的教育方针，广泛深入地宣传党中央关于两种劳动制度、两种教育制度的指示，使广大干部、群众，特别是教育工作者，认识到举办半农半读半工半读教育的重大意义，明确办学方向，鼓舞革命干劲，增强工作信心。在形势大好的情况下，头脑不要发热，要作冷静的促进派；在遇到困难的时候，不要动摇，认清方向，坚持到底。耕读小学和农业中学，必须按照边发展，边巩固，发展一批，巩固一批的要求办事，实事求是地扎扎实实地把工作做好，稳步前进。
    二、必须坚持从群众中来、到群众中去的领导同群众相结合的工作方法。有事和群众商量，善于把党的方针政策变为群众自觉自愿的行动。有些地方在办学过程中没有充分发动群众，不从实际情况出发，要求过高过急，采取了简单的行政命令的错误做法，应当切实检查纠正。耕读小学和农业中学的巩固提高工作，以及新办学校时，都必须从当地的实际情况出发，因地、因时、因人制宜，多种多样。不能要求一律化。耕读小学一校可以有不同类型的班，一班可以有不同类型的组和人，进行复式教学。农业中学要坚持半农半读，妥善安排生产劳动和学习时间。总之，应该适应当地群众的需要，适应当地生产的需要，为三大革命运动服务。
    三、必须坚持勤俭办学的原则。学习大寨的革命精神，自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办学。真正作到减轻国家、集体和学生家庭的经济负担。领导上要关心教师的生活。教师的工资待遇，要经过社员民主讨论，合理解决，真正落实。
    四、必须建立一支革命化、劳动化的教师队伍。首先，要组织教师大学毛主席著作，在
  “用”字上狠下功夫，把毛主席的书当作我们工作的最高指示。当前还应该领导教师，向毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习，向雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、欧阳海等同志学习，树立革命的人生观，树立为贫下中农服务的思想，甘当半农半读教育的“志愿兵”。第二，教师必须坚持参加生产劳动，实行半农半教。第三，教师必须经常深入实际，密切联系群众，不断提高政治、文化水平，不断改进教学，提高教学质量。第四，耕读小学和农业中学教师，可以与附近的全日制小学和中学挂钩，在党的教育方针指导下，互相学习，互相促进，取长补短，共同提高。
    五、必须依靠党的领导。各级教育行政部门，一定要在党委的领导下，依靠广大群众，与有关部门通力合作，经常深入实际，蹲点调查研究，及时总结推广先进经验，树立样板，带动全面。不论是教育行政部门，还是学校，都必须经常地、主动地向当地党委汇报情况，提出对工作的意见，请示党委，按照党委的指示办事，使耕读小学和农业中学不断地得到巩固和发展。
