    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 29th - According to the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, patriotic officers and soldiers of the First Armored Regiment of the South Vietnamese puppet army, stationed in Thu Dau Mot Province, staged an uprising on March 23rd and turned their guns around to attack the enemy.

    According to preliminary reports, with the help of the local masses and the support and cooperation of the Liberation Army, they seized a batch of armored vehicles and launched a rapid and fierce attack on the enemy, quickly capturing the headquarters of the First Armored Regiment. Subsequently, they completely seized and destroyed the M-113 amphibious armored vehicle sub-regiment, the M-41 tank sub-regiment, and ten military vehicles. Taking advantage of their victory, they attacked the headquarters of the puppet army's Fifth Division and the camp of the puppet army's Eighth Regiment, using armored vehicles to destroy many enemy fortifications and tents, and annihilating a large number of enemies.

    The report said that the countless bloody crimes committed by the American invaders in South Vietnam have made the patriotic officers and soldiers who revolted realize that the American imperialists are the enemies of the Vietnamese people, and that the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique is nothing more than a group of Vietnamese traitors acting as American lackeys. They felt that they could no longer tolerate the American bandits continuing to ravage their motherland and were unwilling to continue to serve as cannon fodder for the American imperialist aggressors, so they resolutely revolted and joined the ranks of resisting America and saving the country.

    These insurgent officers and soldiers also issued a statement exposing the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism and the treasonous crimes of the Saigon puppet regime, calling on other puppet army units to stage uprisings and participate in the just struggle to resist America and save the country.

    These patriotic officers and soldiers who revolted were warmly welcomed by representatives of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the local people.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Saigon: On the night of the 23rd, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on three enemy strongholds and one enemy military camp north of Saigon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Army attacked Thu Dau Mot City north of Saigon, the camp where the armored regiment headquarters of the South Vietnamese puppet army's Fifth Division was located, and a puppet military school, among others. The camp where the puppet army armored regiment headquarters was located suffered the heaviest losses. This camp was only about one and a half kilometers from a camp of the American First Infantry Division. The Liberation Armed Forces initially used mortars to bombard the puppet army camp fiercely and then rushed into the enemy's defensive perimeter, attacking the enemy from three sides. They quickly seized three enemy tanks, used a heavy machine gun on one tank to strafe the enemy, and drove away two other tanks to attack a nearby puppet military school. The Liberation Army fighters beat the enemy into a terrible mess and a state of chaos. However, the nearby American First Infantry Division troops never dared to come out to rescue them. According to United Press International, the rumbling sound of puppet army tanks scattering and fleeing in the suburbs of Saigon put the city "immediately on alert."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 27th - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas in the South Vietnamese provinces of Binh Dinh, Quang Tri, Ba Ria, and Kontum have recently continued to attack the enemy and have achieved many new victories.

    On the night of March 7th, the Binh Dinh Provincial Liberation Armed Forces, after destroying two bridges in the Chuong Hoa area, fiercely attacked three battalions of puppet troops in the towns of Tam Quan and Gia Huu, eliminating more than 80 enemy soldiers and destroying three 105mm caliber artillery pieces.

    On the night of March 12th, the Quang Tri Provincial Liberation Armed Forces attacked the An Lac stronghold in Hai Phu commune, Hai Lang county, annihilating an entire enemy platoon and forcing another platoon to withdraw.

    In the first ten days of March, the guerrillas in this province also eliminated 118 enemy soldiers and destroyed two enemy military vehicles in various places.

    In Ba Ria Province, from March 1st to 7th, the Liberation Armed Forces repeatedly intercepted the puppet troops who were conducting "sweeping" operations in the liberated areas of Long Dien County and Dat Do County, eliminating 64 enemy soldiers (including three American invaders). The Kontum Provincial guerrillas attacked and intercepted the enemy many times in the twelve days starting from February 10th, eliminating more than 100 enemy soldiers and destroying three enemy military vehicles.

    广大伪军可以成为人民武装的重要补充来源
    南越伪军一个装甲团爱国官兵起义
    掉转枪口发动猛攻夺取装甲车消灭大量敌人
    新华社河内二十九日电  据越南南方解放电台报道，驻扎在土龙木省的南越伪军第一装甲团的爱国官兵三月二十三日举行起义，并且掉转枪口，向敌人发动进攻。
    据初步消息，他们在当地群众的帮助和解放军的支持和配合下，夺取了一批装甲车，迅速和猛烈地向敌人发起进攻，很快就攻占了第一装甲团团部。接着，又全部夺取和摧毁了M—113型两栖装甲车支团、M—41型坦克车支团和十辆军车。他们还乘胜进攻了伪军第五师师部和伪军第八团的营地，用装甲车摧毁敌人的许多工事和帐篷，歼灭大批敌人。
    报道说，美国侵略者在越南南方犯下的无数血腥罪行，使起义的爱国官兵看清了美帝国主义者是越南人民的敌人，阮文绍—阮高其集团不过是一批充当美国走狗的越奸，他们感到再也不能容忍美国强盗继续蹂躏自己的祖国，不愿再给美帝国主义侵略者充当炮灰，于是毅然起义站到抗美救国的队伍中来。
    这些起义官兵还发表声明，揭露美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和西贡伪政权的卖国罪行，呼吁其他伪军单位举行起义，参加抗美救国的正义斗争。
    这些起义的爱国官兵受到越南南方民族解放阵线代表和当地人民的热烈欢迎。
    新华社讯  西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十三日深夜猛烈攻击西贡以北三个敌人据点和一个敌军营地，使敌人遭到重大损失。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放军袭击了西贡以北的土龙木市、南越伪军第五师的装甲团团部所在的营地和一个伪军事学校等，其中伪军装甲团团部所在的营地遭受损失最重。这个营地距美国第一步兵师的一个营地只有约一公里半。解放武装力量最初用迫击炮猛烈轰击这个伪军营地，并且冲入敌人的防卫圈，从三面袭击敌人。他们迅速地夺取了三辆敌军坦克，用一辆坦克上的重机关枪扫射敌人，并且开走另外两辆坦克去袭击附近的一所伪军军事学校。解放军战士把敌人打得狼狈不堪，一片混乱。但是，附近的美国第一步兵师部队始终不敢出来救援。合众国际社的消息说，伪军四散逃跑的坦克在西贡郊区响起的隆隆声，使这个城市“马上处于警戒状态”。
    据新华社河内二十七日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定、广治、巴地、昆嵩等省解放武装力量和游击队，最近不断袭击敌人，取得了许多新战果。
    三月七日夜间，平定省解放武装力量，在炸毁章和地区的两座桥梁之后，猛烈袭击在三关镇和嘉佑山的三个营伪军，歼敌八十多名，摧毁一零五毫米口径的大炮三门。
    广治省解放武装力量三月十二日夜晚进攻敌人的海陵县海富乡安乐据点，全歼敌人一个排，迫使另一个排撤走。
    在三月份头十天中，这个省的游击队还在各地歼灭敌人一百一十八名，击毁敌军车两辆。
    在巴地省，解放武装力量于三月一日到七日，接连截击对隆田县和红土县解放区进行“扫荡”的伪军，歼敌六十四名（其中包括美国侵略军三名）。昆嵩省游击队在从二月十日起的十二天中，多次袭击和截击敌人，歼敌一百多名，击毁敌人军车三辆。
