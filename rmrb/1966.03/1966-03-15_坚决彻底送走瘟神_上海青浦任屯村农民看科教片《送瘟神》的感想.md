    Bu Wenzhou (Poor Peasant):
    The Rentun Village before liberation was just like the film described. When I was a child, Rentun Village had three hundred households and over four hundred laborers. Due to poverty and disease, only a little over a hundred households and a little over a hundred laborers remained. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry; some families were broken up, wives and children scattered. More than eighty households were completely wiped out, and more than twenty households were left with only one person alive; I witnessed all of this myself.

    Why did this happen? It was because the Kuomintang didn't care about the people's suffering and even engaged in superstition to harm people. The village had several Five Gods Temples, but they didn't cure anyone's diseases. Wu Xiugen's family of nine eventually died out completely; Shunquan had two sons who both died, and he himself contracted schistosomiasis, and was forced to pay rent and debts by the landlord, so he hanged himself. Pan Xingquan's five or six children all died. If we hadn't been liberated, our village probably wouldn't exist anymore.

    Schistosomiasis, we can't see it with our eyes, this fellow kills without drawing blood. Before liberation, for seven or eight years, there wasn't a single child's diaper to be seen in the village, and not a single baby's cry could be heard. In the past, people said: "Rentun Village is a village with no people, boys don't grow, girls don't give birth."

    After liberation, Chairman Mao sent a large number of doctors to treat us. Now our village has more than three hundred laborers and one hundred and sixty-five households, with six hundred and fifty-five people. Our sports activities are also developing very well. We are often the champions in the county basketball competition. The militia is armed, and production has changed greatly. Last year, the double-cropping rice yield was more than seven hundred jin per mu. Before, everyone had a yellow and lifeless complexion, but now they are full of vitality. All these benefits are given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    I was three years old when my father died, and when I was in my twenties, I worked as a farmhand, carrying schistosomiasis. In 1958, the doctor sent by the Party performed an operation on me. We are that group of people in the film who have been cured. After watching the film, I am both happy and heartbroken, as if I have been reborn.
    Bu Yunquan (Poor Peasant)

    Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, my bones would have rotted long ago. My father died when I was ten, my mother worked as a servant for others, I herded cattle for others, and my sister was a child bride. I worked as a farmhand for thirteen years and got "big belly" disease, but I didn't have the money to treat it. After liberation, I had an operation, and now I am well. After watching the film, recalling the suffering of being sick in the past, I couldn't sleep all night. I can't thank Chairman Mao enough for his kindness. Now, I have two sons and three grandchildren, and the whole family actively participates in labor and lives happily, and life is very happy.
    Luo Jinren (Production Team Leader, Poor Peasant):

    Before liberation, the reactionaries only knew how to collect exorbitant taxes and levies and did not care about the people's illnesses and suffering. My whole family of five suffered from schistosomiasis. We borrowed money but couldn't get good treatment. Later, we sought help from gods and worshiped Buddha, and ate incense ash, but the disease became more and more serious. My younger brother also got sick when he was twelve. At that time, superstitious ideas were very strong. We thought our surname was not good, so we gave my brother to another family and took their surname. He died at the age of fifteen. Only I was left of the young people in the family, and I was also sick. People said that the feng shui of the old grave was not good, so we asked a feng shui master to look at the cemetery. But the disease still couldn't be cured.

    After liberation, the Party sent a large number of doctors to treat us. We also started to engage in large-scale sanitation work. I was a late-stage patient and had an operation in 1959 and was cured. Now my body is very good, I can carry things, and I got married and have two children. The contrast before and after is earth-shattering. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao can I be reborn.

    Through the comparison with the film, I feel that our sanitation work is not good enough. In the future, we should vigorously mobilize the masses to completely eliminate snails, so that future generations will never suffer from schistosomiasis again.
    Chen Wencai (Schistosomiasis Prevention Worker, Poor Peasant):

    The color educational film "Sending Away the Plague God" coming to Rentun Village Brigade is a great happy event. After watching the film, I felt like I had attended a vivid political lesson and a wonderful technical guidance class.

    I am a schistosomiasis prevention worker, and I haven't done a good job in schistosomiasis prevention. After watching the film, I felt ashamed. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee attach such importance to schistosomiasis prevention work and sent a large number of doctors to see us farmers. From the film, we also saw the cured patients. In order to express their gratitude to the Party, they worked hard to improve production. Chairman Mao's poem "Sending Away the Plague God" encourages us to resolutely eliminate schistosomiasis. Chairman Mao taught us to despise the enemy strategically and pay attention to the enemy tactically. Engaging in schistosomiasis prevention work is also a battle, and it is also a revolution, so we must also act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. From the film, I saw that a pair of snails can breed about two hundred offspring a year, which gave me a warning. If a pair of snails is left, it will breed two hundred offspring a year, and in a few years, snails will be everywhere again. So we must eradicate them completely.

    In "Sending Away the Plague God", I saw the scene where the eggs of schistosomiasis must pass through feces and water to encounter snails, which made me realize that strengthening fecal management is also very important. In the past, we only focused on investigating and eliminating snails. In the future, we must also do a good job in comprehensive work of water management and fecal management.

    In addition, I have some suggestions for the film "Sending Away the Plague God". For example, what temperature is most suitable for snail growth? In the water network area, where is the density of snails the highest in how deep water? What issues should be paid attention to when treating patients? These issues should be clarified in the film.
    Li Xiuren (Poor Peasant):

    Without watching the movie, I forgot the pain of the past. After watching it, I remembered the suffering of the past. My father, sister and I, two of us died of illness, leaving me alone. I was also very ill and could not farm. People shook their heads when they saw me. Before I left the house, my belly left first, and I couldn't see my shoes myself. After liberation, the doctors sent by Chairman Mao cured me. Now I am a first-class laborer and can earn three thousand work points a year. Life is very good, I am healthy, and I got married and have four children. In the future, I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao, work hard to improve production, support socialist construction, and support the world revolution.
    Wu A'da (Party Branch Secretary):

    After watching the film, I felt that the work in Rentun Village was far from enough. The Rentun Village in the film before liberation was indeed not like a village, and people were not like people. For many years, the crying of babies could not be heard, the houses were uninhabited, and the fields were abandoned. Before liberation, we suffered from the cruel landlords. Coupled with severe schistosomiasis, it made people breathless. At that time, we didn't know the harm of the disease, we just said we had a hard life.

    In 1949, Rentun Village saw the clear sky and the withered trees regained life. The Party cared about the lives of the masses and sent a large number of doctors to treat our schistosomiasis.

    In 1956, we launched a vigorous mass snail elimination campaign, adopting a combination of regular and intensive measures, and a combination of masses and professionals. The snail density was reduced. This year's inspection shows that snails have been basically eliminated. But we cannot relax, we must consolidate the achievements we have made. After watching the film, I felt that our village's fecal management work and snail elimination work were far from enough. In the future, we must persevere and completely send away the plague god.

    坚决彻底送走瘟神
    ——上海青浦任屯村农民看科教片《送瘟神》的感想
    卜温州（贫农）：
    解放前的任屯村跟电影里说的一样。我小时候，任屯村有三百户，四百多个劳动力。由于贫病交迫，后来只剩下一百多户，一百多个劳动力。想起来就要流泪，有的家破人亡，妻离子散。全家死光的，有八十多户，死剩一人的，有二十多户，这些都是我亲眼所见的。
    为什么会这样呢？是国民党不关心人民疾苦，还搞迷信害人，村上五神庙，造了好几座，可就是没给人治病。吴秀根一家九口，后来死得一人也不剩；顺全有两个儿子全死了，他自己得了血吸虫病，加上被地主逼租逼债，后来也上吊死了。潘杏泉的五六个小囡全死光了。要是不解放，我们这个村恐怕早就不存在了。
    血吸虫，我们眼睛看不到，这个家伙是杀人不见血的。解放前，七八年中，村里不见一块小孩的尿布，听不到一声婴儿的哭声。过去人们这样说：“任屯村是个无人村，男不长，女不生。”
    解放以后，毛主席派来了大批医生，给我们治疗，现在我们村劳动力有三百多，一百六十五户，就有六百五十五口人。我们的体育活动开展得也很好，全县篮球比赛，我们常常是冠军；民兵武装起来了，生产上大变样，去年双季稻亩产七百多斤。以前人人是黄皮死气，现在是满面红光，这些好处都是共产党和毛主席给的。
    我三岁时死了父亲，我二十多岁带着血吸虫病给人当长工。一九五八年，党派来的医生给我动了手术。我们就是电影里那一群治好了病的人。看了电影又高兴，又痛心，我好象是换了世的人。卜云全（贫农）
    没有共产党，没有毛主席，我的骨头早就烂了。我十岁死父亲，母亲给人家做阿婆，我给人家看牛，姐姐做童养媳妇。我做了十三年长工，得了“大肚皮”病，也没钱治。解放后，我动了手术，现在人已好了。看了电影，回忆起过去得病的苦处，一晚上睡不着觉，我谢不尽毛主席的恩情。现在，我有两个儿子，三个孙子，全家人积极参加劳动，欢欢乐乐过日子，生活很幸福。罗金仁（生产队长，贫农）：
    解放前，反动派只知收苛捐杂税，不关心百姓疾病痛苦。我全家五人受血吸虫病的害，借了债，也没看好病，后来又求神拜佛，吃香灰，病越来越厉害。我弟弟十二岁也得了病，当时迷信思想很重，以为我家姓不好，就把弟弟过房给人家，取人家的姓，他到十五岁也死掉了。全家年青人只剩我一个，还得病，人家说，是老坟上风水不好，又请风水先生来看坟地。可是，病还是好不了。
    解放后，党派了大批医生来治疗。我们自己也起来大搞卫生工作。我是晚期病人，一九五九年动了手术，治好了病。现在身体很好，能挑能背，还结了婚，养了两个小孩。前后对比，真是翻天覆地。只有党和毛主席领导，我才重做了一个人。
    通过电影一对照，我感到我们的卫生工作搞得还不够，今后应大力发动群众，彻底消灭钉螺，叫子孙万代再不吃血吸虫病的苦。陈文彩（血防员，贫农）：
    彩色科教片《送瘟神》来任屯村大队放映，是一桩大喜事。看了影片以后，我象上了一堂生动的政治课和精采的技术指导课。
    我是血防员，对血防工作没做好，看了电影以后，感到惭愧。毛主席和党中央对血防工作这样重视，派了大批医生，来给我们农民看病。从电影里我们也看到了治好的病人，为了表示对党的感谢，他们发奋图强，搞好生产。毛主席写的《送瘟神》诗，鼓舞我们去坚决消灭血吸虫病。毛主席教导我们在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人。搞血防工作，也是一场战斗，也是一场革命，所以我们也一定要根据毛主席的这个指示办事。从影片上看到了一对钉螺一年大约要繁殖二百多只，给我敲了一记警钟，如果留下一对钉螺，一年要繁殖二百多只，几年以后，遍地又是钉螺了，所以我们一定要斩草除根，彻底消灭钉螺。
    在《送瘟神》里，我看到了血吸虫的虫卵必须通过大便下水，才能遇到钉螺的镜头，使我认识到加强粪便管理也是十分重要的。以前我们只重视查螺灭螺，今后还要做好用水管理和粪便管理的综合性工作。
    另外，对影片《送瘟神》提些建议，比如钉螺在什么温度下生长最适宜？在水网地区，钉螺在水多少深的地方密度最高？治疗病人，要注意哪些事情等问题应在片子里说清楚。李秀仁（贫农）：
    不看电影，忘了以前的痛苦，看了以后，想起以前的苦。父亲、姐姐和我三人，病死了两人，剩下我一人，我也病得厉害，不能种田，人家见了我，都摇头。人没出门，肚皮先出门，穿着鞋子自己看不到。解放后，毛主席派来的医生给我治好了病，现在我是一等劳力，一年能做到三千工分。生活很好，身体健康，又结了婚，有四个孩子。今后我一定听毛主席的话，努力搞好生产，支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命。吴阿大（党支部书记）：
    看了电影，感到任屯村的工作很不够。影片里解放前的任屯村，确实村不象村，人不象人，好多年里，听不见婴儿的哭声，房子没有人住，田也荒掉了。解放前，我们受尽反动派地主的苦；加上严重的血吸虫病，使人喘不过气来。那时，不知病害，只说命苦。
      一九四九年，任屯村见了青天，枯木又逢春。党关心群众生活，派了大批医生，给我们治血吸虫病。
    一九五六年，我们开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性灭螺运动，采取经常性和突击性相结合，群众和专业相结合的措施，钉螺密度减小了。今年检查，钉螺基本消灭。但还不能放松，必须巩固已取得的成绩。看了电影以后，感到我村的粪便管理工作，灭螺工作还很不够。今后，我们一定要坚持下去，彻底送走瘟神。
