    A Very Good Lesson
    In the past, I thought that it was worthwhile to bravely sacrifice oneself on the battlefield fighting against class enemies, but in peaceful times there were no life-and-death tests. Now it seems that fighting against nature also requires true revolutionaries who are not afraid of hardship or death, and it also requires paying a great price. In this regard, Comrade Jiao Yulu has given me a very good lesson.

    很好的一课
    过去认为跟阶级敌人斗在战场上英勇牺牲是值得的，在和平年代里没有出生入死的考验。现在看来，跟自然界斗，也同样要有不怕苦不怕死的真革命者，同样要付出大的代价。在这一方面，焦裕禄同志给我上了很好的一课。
