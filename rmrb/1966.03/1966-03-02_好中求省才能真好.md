Title: True Excellence Lies in Achieving Quality While Saving Resources

    The policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" is an indivisible whole, and neglecting any aspect of it is not acceptable. We advocate "quality first," which is necessary. We also advocate striving for more, faster, and more economical within the realm of quality, which is equally necessary. Focusing solely on quality without considering quantity, speed, and economy is also a form of one-sidedness.

    The reader's letter published today tells us that some new products currently have excellent performance and high efficiency, so it can be said that "quality comes first." However, because people have not paid enough attention to the "saving" aspect in the design and manufacturing process, the prices are too high, and users dare not inquire about them, which prevents these excellent new products from being widely promoted and used. This is a problem worth noting.

    There may be various reasons for the high prices of new products. But the most fundamental reason must be found in people's thinking.

    Some technicians at the Wenzhou Machinery Research Institute said: "Whether a machine is easy to use is the responsibility of the technical department, and whether others can afford it is something that should be considered by the state." This is a very wrong statement. What is wrong with this statement? It is wrong because they have separated "quality" and "saving," treating them as two completely unrelated matters. In fact, "whether a machine is easy to use" is not just a technical issue, but also includes an economic issue, because any user who wants to use a machine must first buy it. If the machine is too expensive and they cannot afford it, how can they talk about using it? If no one buys it, no matter how good the machine is, it cannot play its role, and "quality" will turn into "non-quality," won't it? If a machine is produced for use but ends up being useless, what quality is there to talk about?

    Some people worry that if we pay attention to "saving," will we still be able to achieve quality? The answer is yes. The Wenzhou river mud suction boat, after the design was improved, still had good quality, but the cost was reduced by more than half, which is an example. Why is the simple ramie stripping machine in Guangdong so popular among the masses? Because it truly achieves good quality and low price, it is both "quality first," improving the arduous manual labor and increasing labor productivity; and it strives for quality while saving resources, costing only seven jiao, which everyone can afford.

    "Quality first" is an unshakable principle. The "quality" advocated here is unified with "saving." Such "quality" is true quality. Such good products are welcomed by the masses and are the most vital.

    To unify quality and saving, the fundamental way is to proceed from reality. The reality of our country is: on the one hand, factories and rural areas urgently need various industrial products to equip themselves and improve production efficiency; on the other hand, our country is still relatively poor, and everyone must do as much as possible with as little money as possible. This is the starting point for our consideration of saving. Was the river mud dredging boat initially designed by the Wenzhou Machinery Research Institute for 12,000 yuan good? It would definitely be "better" in some aspects than the boat later modified by Ningbo for 700 yuan, with better mud suction quality and higher efficiency, able to fill a boat with river mud in three minutes. But what the masses welcome is the latter, not the former, because the former is divorced from the reality of purchasing power, while the latter proceeds from this reality. Comrades from the Ningbo Prefecture Industrial Science Research Institute went deep into the masses, visited and investigated farmers, and found a good way to modify the water pump boat into a three-purpose boat for pumping water, sucking mud, and transporting it, which was both good and economical.

    By understanding both the needs of production and life and the purchasing power level of the masses, we can unify quality and saving.

### 好中求省才能真好

专栏：短评

    好中求省才能真好
    “多快好省”的方针是一个不可分割的整体，忽视任何一方面都不应该。我们提倡“好字当头”，这是必要的。我们同时提倡好中求多，好中求快，好中求省，这同样是必要的。只在好字上下功夫，而不在多、快、省字上下功夫，也是一种片面性。
    今天发表的读者来信告诉我们：目前有些新产品，性能很好，效率很高，可以说“好字当头”了。但是由于人们在设计和制造过程中，对“省”字注意不够，以致价格太贵，用户不敢问津，结果使这些很好的新产品不能普遍的推广使用。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    新产品价格过高，原因可能是多方面的。但最根本的原因，还得从人们的思想上去寻找。
    温州市机械研究所的有些技术人员说：“机器好不好用是技术部门的责任，至于别人买得起买不起，那是应该由国家去考虑的事。”这是一种很错误的说法。这种说法错在哪里呢？就错在他们把“好”和“省”分割开来了，看成了截然无关的两件事。其实，“机器好用不好用”，不单是一个技术问题，还包括一个经济问题，因为任何用户要用机器，首先得买机器，如果机器价格太贵，买都买不起，哪里能谈得上用呢。如果没人买，机器再好也发挥不了作用，“好”不就转化为不好了吗？本来生产出来是为了用的机器，结果变成无用的东西，还谈得上什么好呢？
    有人担心，注意了“省”，还能不能做到好呢？答复是肯定的。温州的吸河泥机船，在改进设计以后，质量还是很好，造价却省了一大半，就是一个例子。广东的一种简易剥麻器，为什么很受群众欢迎？因为它真正做到了物美价廉，既是“好字当头”，改善了艰苦的手工劳动，提高了劳动生产率；又是好中求省，七角钱一个，人人买得起。
    “好字当头”，这是一个不可动摇的原则。这里所提倡的“好”，是与“省”相统一的。这样的“好”，才是真好。这样的好产品才是群众所欢迎的，也是最有生命力的。
    要把好与省统一起来，根本办法是从实际出发。我们国家的实际是：一方面无论工厂、农村，都迫切需要有各种各样的工业产品来装备自己，提高生产效率；另方面是，我们国家毕竟还比较穷，大家都要用尽可能少的钱办尽可能多的事。这就是我们考虑省的出发点。温州机械研究所最初设计的一万二千元一艘的挖河泥机船好不好呢？它在某些方面肯定会比后来宁波用七百元改装的船“好”，吸泥质量好，工效高，三分钟就能吸满一船河泥。但是群众欢迎的是后者，而不是前者，因为前者脱离了购买力的实际，后者则是从这种实际出发的。宁波专区工业科学研究所的同志，深入到群众中，向农民访问、调查，就找到了既好又省的把抽水机船改装为抽水、吸泥、运输三用船的好办法。
    既了解生产和生活的需要，又了解群众的购买力水平，我们就能把好和省统一起来。
