    According to Xinhua News Agency, African public opinion continues to condemn the U.S. and British imperialist instigation of the coup in Ghana, and expresses support for President Nkrumah.
    African students in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, held a gathering on the evening of the 20th, strongly criticizing the U.S. and British imperialists for launching a military coup in Ghana recently, and announced their support for the people of Ghana and President Nkrumah.
    Speakers at the meeting included student representatives from various African countries, African freedom fighters, and student representatives from Palestine. They also announced their support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe.
    Degile Sid Mohammed, the student representative from Mali, pointed out: "The United States and Britain are the strongholds of neo-colonialism. From the recent series of coups in Africa, it can be seen that they have been doing everything possible to stop the African liberation movement from moving forward." He also said that the coup in Accra was planned in Washington and London.
    Ibrahim, the representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa, emphasized at the meeting: "Imperialism and colonialism are engaged in a life-and-death struggle in Africa, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and Palestine. All these events should open our eyes and make us see through the nature of imperialism more clearly."
    Ibrahim condemned the imperialists for trying every means possible to cling to southern Africa, treating it as their last stronghold. He advocated using revolutionary violence to deal with imperialist counter-revolutionary violence in order to achieve the true liberation of southern Africa.
    Taysir Kuba, the Palestinian student representative, condemned the conspiracy of the United States and Britain against the people of Ghana, and condemned the United States and Britain for supporting Israel against Arab countries.
    The meeting adopted a resolution condemning the imperialist instigation of the coup in Ghana. The resolution also expressed support for the armed struggles of the people of Vietnam, the occupied Arab South, Portuguese Guinea, Angola, Mozambique, and other countries under colonial occupation. The resolution condemned racial discrimination in South Africa and other parts of the world.
    The Secretariat of the Sudanese Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization recently issued a statement in Khartoum, the capital, pointing out that the imperialist instigation of a military coup in Ghana is the culmination of imperialist interference in newly independent African countries. The statement said that a persistent struggle against imperialism must be waged to defend the right of the African peoples to change their suffering and backward situation and to advance along the road of freedom, independence, and progress.
    A commentary in the United Arab Republic's *Evening News* on the 16th said that the developments in Ghana were a surprise attack planned by imperialism, and that the plan was carried out by a group of traitors and lackeys who did not conceal their betrayal and complete submission to their imperialist masters.
    A commentary in the *Republic* on the 16th pointed out that imperialism launched an insidious attack on the revolutionary regime in Ghana from behind. The imperialist conspiracy against Ghana has created a serious situation in Africa, which forces African leaders to defend themselves against imperialism.

    非洲公众舆论强调必须坚持反帝斗争
    用革命暴力反对帝国主义的暴力
    据新华社讯　非洲公众舆论继续谴责美英帝国主义策动加纳政变，并表示支持恩克鲁玛总统。
    在阿联首都开罗的非洲学生二十日晚举行集会，强烈抨击美、英帝国主义最近在加纳发动军事政变，并且宣布支持加纳人民和恩克鲁玛总统。
    在这次会上发言的有来自非洲各国学生代表，有非洲自由战士和巴勒斯坦的学生代表。他们还宣布他们支持津巴布韦人民的斗争。
    马里的学生代表德吉尔·西德·穆罕默德指出：“美国和英国是新殖民主义的堡垒。从非洲最近一连串的政变中可以看到，他们一直在用尽一切办法来阻止非洲解放运动前进。”他还说，阿克拉的政变是在华盛顿和伦敦策划的。
    南非泛非主义者大会的代表易卜拉欣在会上强调指出：“帝国主义和殖民主义正在非洲、越南、多米尼加和巴勒斯坦进行生死的斗争。所有这些事件应当使我们打开眼睛，更加清楚地看穿帝国主义的本性。”
    易卜拉欣谴责帝国主义者千方百计要赖在非洲南部，把那里当作他们最后的堡垒。他主张以革命的暴力来对付帝国主义的反革命暴力，以实现非洲南部的真正解放。
    巴勒斯坦学生代表泰西尔·库巴谴责美国和英国对加纳人民策划的阴谋，谴责美英两国支持以色列反对阿拉伯国家。
    会上通过一项决议，谴责帝国主义在加纳策动政变。决议还表示支持越南、被占领的阿拉伯南部、葡属几内亚、安哥拉、莫三鼻给和在殖民主义占领下的其他国家的人民进行的武装斗争。决议谴责南非和世界其他地区实行的种族歧视。
    苏丹亚非人民团结组织秘书处最近在首都喀土穆发表声明指出，帝国主义在加纳策动军事政变是帝国主义干涉非洲新独立国家的高峰。声明说，必须进行坚持不懈的反对帝国主义的斗争，保卫非洲各国人民改变痛苦、落后状况和沿着自由、独立和进步道路前进的权利。
    阿联《晚报》十六日的评论说，加纳的事态发展是帝国主义策划的突然袭击，执行这一计划的是一群卖国贼和走狗，他们并不掩盖自己卖国和完全屈从帝国主义主子的面目。
    《共和国报》十六日的评论指出，帝国主义从背后对加纳的革命政权进行了阴险的袭击。帝国主义对加纳的阴谋在非洲已经造成严重的局势，这种局势使非洲领袖们不得不对帝国主义进行自卫反击。
