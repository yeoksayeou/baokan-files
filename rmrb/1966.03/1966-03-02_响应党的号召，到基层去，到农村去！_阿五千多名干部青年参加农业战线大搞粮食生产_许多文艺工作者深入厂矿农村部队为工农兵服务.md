    Responding to the Party's call, go to the grassroots, go to the countryside!
    More than 5,000 Albanian cadres and youths participate in the agricultural front to vigorously develop grain production.
    Many literary and art workers go deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and troops to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana — More than 5,000 Albanian government cadres and youths have recently settled down in the countryside, determined to contribute to vigorously developing grain production and building a new socialist countryside.
    This group of people voluntarily signed up to go to the countryside to participate in production and work in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor. Among them are Party and government cadres, People's Assembly representatives, People's Army officers who have performed meritorious service in wartime, as well as urban workers who volunteer to go to the agricultural front and youths who aspire to live in the countryside.
    According to preliminary statistics from various districts across the country, the number of state cadres and other administrative staff who have recently gone to the production front, especially to work and labor in the countryside, has reached 4,500; in addition, more than 700 young people have also rushed to the forefront of agricultural production. After arriving at agricultural cooperatives in various places, they have begun to work with the members.
    Recently, warm send-off and welcome meetings have been held in various places. Ha. Kaso, an agronomist who settled down in the Rogozhina Agricultural Cooperative in the Durrës District, said, "I want to live in the countryside for the rest of my life. I will never leave here. The agricultural front is my post." A. Haxhiu, a famous old guerrilla fighter and representative of the People's Assembly, said that he would work with the farmers to vigorously develop grain production, strive to achieve grain self-sufficiency, and work hard to build a new life.
    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, a group of forty writers and artists, headed by Dhimiter Shuteriqi, Chairman of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association, recently went deep into grassroots units such as factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, and troops in order to better understand the lives and labor of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thus better serve them.
    This group of literary and art workers, who responded to the call of the Albanian Party of Labor to go deep into the grassroots, is scattered in twelve districts across the country. (Attached picture)

    响应党的号召，到基层去，到农村去！

    新华社地拉那电  五千多名阿尔巴尼亚机关干部和青年最近到农村安家落户，决心为大搞粮食生产和建设社会主义新农村贡献自己的力量。
    这批人员是响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会号召，自愿报名到农村参加生产和工作的。他们当中有党和政府干部，有人民议会代表，有在战时立过战功的人民军军官以及志愿走上农业战线的城市职工和志在农村的青年。
    据全国各个区的初步统计，最近到生产战线、特别是到农村工作和劳动的国家干部和其他行政工作人员已达四千五百名；另有七百多名青年也已奔赴农业生产第一线。他们到达各地农业社后，已经开始同社员们一起劳动。
    最近，各地纷纷举行热烈的欢送会和欢迎会。到都拉斯区罗果任纳农业社安家落户的农艺师哈·卡索说，“我要在农村住一辈子。我永远也不离开这里。农业战线就是我的岗位。”著名的老游击队员、人民议会代表阿·哈契乌上校表示要同农民们一道大搞粮食生产，争取达到粮食自给，并为建设新生活而努力。
    据新华社地拉那电以阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会主席迪米特尔·舒特里基为首的四十名作家和艺术家最近深入工厂、矿山、农业社和部队等基层单位，以便更好地了解工农兵群众的生活和劳动，从而更好地为他们服务。
    这批响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召深入基层的文艺工作者共分散在全国十二个区。（附图片）
