    The large-scale play "On the Streets," created and performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater and focusing on the lives and struggles of street residents, is a success.

    The story of this play takes place in 1962 on a certain street in Beijing. Various types of residents live here, including an old director of the street committee who wholeheartedly serves the masses, a retired old worker with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, family women who enthusiastically respond to the Party's call and actively participate in street production and construction, and individual people with blurred class viewpoints who are exploited by bourgeois elements. These characters, centered around opposing the conspiratorial activities of Hu Jingli, a bourgeois element who refuses to be reformed, demonstrate different stances, attitudes, and actions, forming entanglements, contradictions, and conflicts between the characters.

    It is worth mentioning that in handling these contradictions, the playwrights did not remain on the surface but strived to place the contradictions and conflicts between the characters on the plane of the struggle between the two ideologies and two roads of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, capitalism and socialism, to reveal them. Thus, they constituted the dramatic conflict of bourgeois infiltration and proletarian anti-infiltration that runs through the entire play.

    As the plot develops, the playwrights increasingly clearly raise a sharp question to the characters in the play and to the audience: In the period of socialist construction, are we to allow the bourgeoisie to engage in "peaceful evolution" on our streets, or are we to carry the socialist revolution on the streets through to the end? The struggle in the play begins with the question of which road should be taken for developing street production.

    When the commune Party committee decided to expand the street embroidery group into an embroidery factory, people of different classes and different thoughts showed different reactions. The vast majority of working women on the street enthusiastically responded to the call, hoping to contribute to socialist construction. However, Hu Jingli, pretending to be enthusiastic, had other plans. She took the opportunity to turn street production into a base for the benefit of a few people and a hotbed for cultivating new bourgeois elements. Therefore, she instigated Liang Yuhua, the head of the women's affairs, who was muddle-headed and deceived by her, to come forward and use various excuses to try to prevent families in difficulty, families of revolutionary martyrs, and street activists from participating in production, pouring cold water on the socialist enthusiasm of the basic masses on the street. In this situation, street activists, led by the old director, countered the capitalist ideas spread by Hu Jingli and patiently educated Liang Yuhua, who had been temporarily deceived by Hu Jingli.

    In this scene, the characters representing the two roads have their first frontal encounter, forming the climax in the first act. In this way, the objective content of class struggle contained in the plot itself is highlighted, making the audience realize that from the very beginning, there were different class lines in organizing street production, and there was a sharp struggle over which road to lead street production to.

    This struggle continues to develop in depth. By the third act, the two sides of the contradiction have fully developed into a confrontation, a situation of imminent war. Liang Yuhua has unconsciously stood on the side of the bourgeoisie and become Hu Jingli's spokesperson. The debate between the old director and Liang Yuhua is a class debate, a debate between socialism and capitalism. Therefore, when the old director on stage searches for the strength and weapons of struggle from Chairman Mao's works with revolutionary passion, the audience is deeply moved. A huge ideological torrent is stirring in our hearts. Together with the characters in the play, we reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They want to struggle against the working class in various ways, including ideological struggle."

    This play also tells us that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the streets is not only in street production but also fiercely carried out in the neighborhood relations of street residents.

    Hu Jingli is good at using certain habitual forces left over from the old society, outdated moral concepts, and things like "human relationships" as means to corrode the class consciousness of the working people, confuse class boundaries, so that she can carry out class infiltration and "peacefully evolve" the revolutionary neighborhood relations between socialist street residents into bourgeois neighborhood relations.

    What are bourgeois neighborhood relations? They are relations based on exploiting others and benefiting oneself at the expense of others. Hu Jingli is playing this game. In the midst of the nonsense of "two goods combine into one good" and "harmonious coexistence," and through the private wooing of eating, drinking, and gifting, Liang Yuhua has gradually fallen into her trap and once become a tool for her criminal activities. Hu Jingli is also cunningly exploiting a working woman named Lu Xiumei under the cover of the old social philosophies of life such as "one quarrel, two ugliness, one harmony, two possessions."

    However, why does Hu Jingli's set of methods only work on Liang Yuhua and Lu Xiumei, but not on the old director and other characters in the play? The reason is that the old director and these revolutionary people have class in their hearts. The old director said it well:
  "We must have a class analysis perspective on people and things. We cannot combine any person or any thought that is confused with the idea that two goods combine into one good."
    When the working people have class in their hearts, they can establish revolutionary neighborhood relations full of class love and comradeship on the basis of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology and jointly participating in socialist revolution and construction, as demonstrated in this play.

    Whether our streets can always be revolutionaryized depends on human factors, especially on the cultivation of red successors. Therefore, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the next generation is a strategic struggle in the class struggle on the streets. The play has made a rather profound and moving description of this aspect.

    Before the second act is about to end, when the old director suddenly discovers that the porter's son, Xiao Qingsheng, is serving wine at Hu Jingli's house for this bourgeois element, she asks in a voice intertwined with surprise, anxiety, and anger: "Qingsheng, are you here too?" This seemingly ordinary question contains the deep concern of an old Communist Party member for the revolutionary future of the next generation of working people.

    This class concern of the old director is prominently demonstrated again in the fourth act. When the old director learns that Hu Jingli has actually used Qingsheng's ignorance to catch frogs for her to earn money, she says something meaningful to Qingsheng's mother: "Hu Jingli is leading your Qingsheng down the wrong path! The hearts of our workers' children are pure and white, and they should be thinking of serving the people wholeheartedly; their hands are clean, and they should be building socialist buildings. He should not be serving capitalists, let alone doing such bad things that make money easily. This will ruin the child." This makes us realize that in order to achieve the great victory of communism for generations to come, we must carry the socialist revolution through to the end in all fields!

    What is not satisfying is that the main positive character, the old director, has more discussion and less action, which reduces the artistic appeal of the character to a certain extent.

    The main achievement of "On the Streets" lies in its relatively vividly promoting the socialist revolution through stage artistic images, promoting Chairman Mao's great thought that class and class struggle, and the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, still exist in socialist society.

    这里也有阶级斗争
    ——看话剧《在街道上》
    王春元
    北京人民艺术剧院创作、演出的以街道居民的生活和斗争为题材的大型话剧《在街道上》，是成功的。
    这个戏的故事发生在一九六二年北京的某条街道上，这里住着各种类型的居民，其中有一心一意为群众服务的街道委员会的老主任，有革命警惕性很高的退休老工人，有热烈响应党的号召、积极参加街道生产建设的家庭妇女，也有个别阶级观点模糊、为资产阶级分子所利用的人。这些人物，围绕着反对一个不接受改造的资产阶级分子胡竞丽的阴谋活动，表现出了不同的立场、态度和行动，形成了人物之间的纠葛、矛盾与冲突。
    值得提出的是，剧本编写者在处理这些矛盾的时候，并没有停留在表面，而是努力把人物之间的矛盾冲突，放在资产阶级与无产阶级、资本主义与社会主义的两种思想、两条道路斗争的纲上来加以揭示，从而构成了贯串全剧的资产阶级渗透与无产阶级的反渗透的戏剧冲突。
    随着剧情的发展，剧作者越来越清楚地向剧中人，同时也向观众提出了一个尖锐的问题：在社会主义建设时期，我们是让资产阶级在我们的街道上搞“和平演变”，还是把街道的社会主义革命进行到底。剧中这场斗争首先是从发展街道生产应该走什么道路开始的。
    当公社党委决定把街道挑花组扩大成挑花厂的时候，不同阶级、不同思想的人们表现出了不同的反应。街道上绝大多数的劳动妇女都热烈响应号召，希望自己能为社会主义建设投进一分力量。但是伪装积极的胡竞丽对于这件事却另有打算，她乘机想把街道生产变成为少数人谋利的据点，变成培植新资产阶级分子的温床。因此她挑唆头脑糊涂，受了她欺骗的妇女主任梁玉华出面，用种种借口竭力阻挡困难户、军烈属和街道积极分子参加生产，给街道基本群众的社会主义积极性泼冷水。在这种情况下，以老主任为首的街道积极分子，对于胡竞丽所散播出来的资本主义思想，给以反击，对一时受了胡竞丽蒙骗的梁玉华，进行了耐心的教育。
    在这段戏里，代表着两条道路的人物，发生了初次的正面交锋，形成第一幕里的高潮。这样一来，就突出了这段戏的情节本身所包含的阶级斗争的客观内容，使观众意识到：组织街道生产，一开始就存在着不同的阶级路线，存在着要把街道生产引向哪条道路上去的尖锐斗争。
    这场斗争继续向纵深发展，到了第三幕，矛盾的双方充分发展成两军对峙、一触即发的决战局面。梁玉华已经在不知不觉之中站到资产阶级那一面去了，成了胡竞丽的代言人。老主任和梁玉华的争论是一场阶级的论战，是社会主义与资本主义之间的论战，因此，当舞台上老主任怀着革命的激情从毛主席的著作中寻找斗争力量和斗争武器的时候，观众被深深地感动了，一股巨大的思想洪流在激荡着我们的心胸，同剧中人一起，我们重温了一次毛主席的伟大教导：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”
    这个戏还告诉我们，无产阶级同资产阶级在街道上的斗争，不仅在街道生产方面，同时也在街道居民的邻里关系方面激烈地进行着。
    胡竞丽善于利用某些旧社会遗留下来的习惯势力、陈腐的道德观念和“人情往来”之类的东西当作手段，来腐蚀劳动人民的阶级意识，混淆阶级界限，以便于她实行阶级渗透，把社会主义街道居民之间的革命的邻里关系“和平演变”为资产阶级的邻里关系。
    什么是资产阶级的邻里关系？那就是建立在剥削别人、损人利己基础上的关系。胡竞丽耍弄的就是这一套。她在“两好合一好”、“和睦相处”的一片鬼话声中和吃吃送送的私人拉拢下，使梁玉华一步步落进她的圈套，一度成为她进行罪恶活动的工具。胡竞丽还在什么“一争两丑，一和两有”之类旧社会人生哲学的遮掩下，对一个名叫陆秀梅的劳动妇女进行着狡猾的剥削。
    但是，胡竞丽这一套手段，为什么只能对梁玉华、陆秀梅起作用，对老主任以及其他剧中人却不起作用呢？原因就在于老主任这些革命人民的心里装着个阶级。老主任说得好：
  “咱们对人对事都要有个阶级分析的眼光，不能跟什么人、什么思想都稀里糊涂两好合一好”。
    劳动人民心里有了阶级，就能在兴无灭资的斗争中，在共同参加社会主义革命和建设的基础上，建立起充满阶级友爱的、同志式的革命的邻里关系。正象这个戏里所表现出来的那样。
    我们的街道能不能永远革命化，关键还在于人的因素，特别是在于红色接班人的培养。因此，无产阶级和资产阶级争夺下一代的斗争，更是街道阶级斗争中的一场有战略意义的争夺战。关于这方面，这出戏作了相当深刻动人的描写。
    当第二幕戏快要落幕之前，老主任突然发现搬运工人的儿子小庆生竟在胡竞丽家给这个资产阶级分子侍候酒席的时候，她用一种交织着惊讶、不安而又愤怒的声音发问：“庆生，你也在这儿？”在这句似乎平常的问话里，却包含着一个老共产党员对于劳动人民下一代革命前途的深切关怀。
    老主任的这种阶级的关怀，到第四幕又被突出地表现出来。当老主任了解到胡竞丽居然利用庆生的无知，替她捕田鸡挣钱的真相之后，她对庆生的母亲说出了一段意味深长的话：“胡竞丽是把你的庆生往坏道上带啊！咱们工人的孩子，清清白白的一颗心，想的应该是全心全意为人民；干干净净的一双手，盖的应该是社会主义的高楼大厦，他不该去侍候资本家，更不能去干这种来钱容易的坏事。这样下去要把孩子给毁了”。这使我们体会到：为了子孙万代的共产主义伟大胜利，一定要把社会主义革命在一切领域里进行到底！
    使人不够满足的是，正面主人公老主任这个形象议论多，行动少。这就在一定程度上减低了人物的艺术感染力量。
      《在街道上》的主要成就正在于它通过舞台艺术形象比较生动地宣传了社会主义革命，宣传了毛主席关于在社会主义社会还存在阶级和阶级斗争，还存在资本主义与社会主义两条道路斗争的伟大思想。（附图片）
