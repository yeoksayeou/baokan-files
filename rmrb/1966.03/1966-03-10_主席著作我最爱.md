    Chairman's Writings Are My Favorite
    Shanghai Second Steel Plant  Wu Zhimao
    Chairman Mao's words are the most important to listen to, increasing production and practicing economy for the revolution; the wheel of innovation never stops, and production potential is infinite.  Chairman's writings are my favorite, I carry them with me all year round; when I encounter a problem, I consult them, and no matter how big the difficulty, I can overcome it. Chairman's writings point the direction, self-reliance to become strong; with the determination of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, the East will surely surpass the West.

    主席著作我最爱
    上海第二钢铁厂  吴芝茂主席讲话最要听，增产节约为革命；革新轮儿永不停，生产潜力无穷尽。主席著作我最爱，一年四季随身带；碰到问题请教它，难关再大攻下来。主席著作指方向，自力更生为图强；立下愚公移山志，东方定能超西方。
