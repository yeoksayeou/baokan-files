    Running Forestry for the People, Relying on the People to Run Forestry
    -- An Account of Attending the National Forestry Work Conference
    Currently, forestry is still a weak link in China's national economic construction, unable to keep up with the needs of national construction and people's lives. How to change this situation as quickly as possible and accelerate the development of forestry? The recently held National Forestry Work Conference in Beijing conducted a serious discussion and study of this issue.

            Developing Forestry Requires Taking Our Own Road
    What is China's path to developing forestry? According to the opinions expressed by the representatives at the conference, the consensus is to hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, adhere to the mass line, adhere to self-reliance, hard struggle, adhere to technical revolution, launch a vigorous mass movement, and take the path of the whole Party and all the people running forestry.
    The representatives attending the meeting cited numerous facts to prove that in the past sixteen years, forestry has developed rapidly in places where this path was followed. Significant achievements have been made in afforestation, forest cultivation, forest protection, and forest regeneration. However, some places have been shouting slogans about afforestation year after year, but afforestation is not seen, and even the original forest resources are not well protected.
    Why do these two different situations occur? Many materials provided by the representatives in the discussion showed that the core of the problem lies in whether or not political prominence is given in forestry work, and whether or not the idea of running forestry for the people and relying on the people to run forestry is firmly established.
    Some people say that digging pits and planting trees is easy, and that during the afforestation season, with a deployment and a call, who can't plant trees? However, digging pits and planting trees is the same, but some are planted alive and some are not; some afforest into forests, and some afforestation does not become forests. Is it only because of different natural conditions such as soil and climate? No! The Jiangsu representative quoted two sentences from the local masses at the meeting: "When people change their thinking, the land changes its appearance," and "When the heart turns red, the mountain turns green," saying that this is their basic experience in developing forestry. This experience of theirs has also been verified by the facts in some other regions.

            Dare to Quench the Immediate Thirst with Distant Water
    Developing forestry and greening the motherland is a struggle to transform nature. Chairman Mao said that to transform the objective world, we must first transform people's subjective world. In this great struggle, only by arming the broad masses of people with Mao Zedong Thought, first carrying out a revolution in thought, and establishing the lofty ambition to change the world, can we not be afraid of difficulties, dare to and be good at fighting against nature, and can we plant trees alive and build forests.
    Some people believe that planting trees and afforestation are "distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst" because the forestry production cycle is long, the benefits are late, easy to be destroyed, and difficult to restore. However, Li Shunda, a nationally renowned labor model, does not see it that way. He said, "To engage in revolution, we must dare to quench immediate thirst with distant water!" He has such lofty ideals in his heart that he dares to lead the commune members to afforest in the mountainous areas with thin soil and thick rocks. In the first year, he planted 300 mu, but only one survived. He was not discouraged, saying, "As long as one lives, it shows that trees can live here!" So he persisted in afforestation, and has now afforested thousands of mu.
    When representatives of many advanced regions and units in forestry construction introduced their experiences, they all said that "trees must first cultivate people." They said that with Dazhai people, there will be Dazhai-style farmland; with Daqing people, there will be Daqing-style oilfields; if there are to be trees on the mountains, people must have the thought of afforestation for the revolution.
    Juancheng County in Shandong Province is one of the advanced typical units in forestry praised at this conference. The leading cadres of the county party committee summarized their personal experience and said: "To run forestry, we must have revolutionary ideals, revolutionary drive, and revolutionary perseverance; although the amount of labor required for forestry production is much smaller than that for agriculture and water conservancy, its amount of ideological work is much larger than that for agriculture and water conservancy." Their experience shows that only through the ideological revolutionization of people can the revolution of nature be realized. The experience of Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi, the experience of Zhanjiang Prefecture in Guangdong, and the experience of many other regions and units all prove from different regions and different angles that this is a universal law.

          First Do a Good Job of Political Work
    To educate the masses to establish the idea of afforestation for the revolution, the forestry leading departments at all levels must give prominence to politics and establish the idea of running forestry for the people and relying on the people to run forestry. Not all forestry cadres have understood this fundamental issue. Some cadres engaged in forestry work cannot leave their profession in three sentences, opening their mouths with trees and closing their mouths with timber, which cannot move people's hearts or mobilize the masses. Some comrades, after learning about the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, in the middle of this conference, suddenly woke up and self-criticized themselves, saying that their work had not been done well in the past because they lacked Jiao Yulu's clear idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and relying on the people for everything. Therefore, some comrades proposed that to build forestry, we must rely on politics and use politics to command forestry. Only by grasping forestry on the basis of giving prominence to politics and doing a good job in political and ideological work can forestry truly be grasped. A leading cadre of Zhaoqing Prefecture in Guangdong said that in 1962, they established a state-commune joint venture cedar forest base in Nanjiang Commune, Yunan County. Because they did not give prominence to politics and relied on money, they gave the masses twelve yuan per mu for afforestation. As a result, the money was spent, but the trees did not grow. Later, they summed up their experience and lessons. In 1964, they built a cedar forest in the same place again. By giving prominence to politics and explaining to the masses for whom to afforest and on whom to rely to afforest, the cost per mu of forest was less than half of the previous time, and a cedar forest of more than 10,000 mu was created.

            Start from the Current Needs of the Masses
    To run forestry for the people, we must, while caring about the long-term interests and fundamental interests of the masses, proceed from the urgent needs of the broad masses for current production and life, take overall consideration, and comprehensively arrange the forestry construction work of each period.
    However, there have been different understandings on this issue in the past. Some people have always worried that developing forestry from the urgent needs of the people's production and life will affect the timber needed for national construction. However, the experience of many advanced forestry regions introduced at this conference shows that afforestation and forest management in accordance with local conditions starting from the urgent needs of the masses for production and life can take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and is an important way for the masses to develop forestry more, faster, better, and more economically. In the past, some places in Hebei Province one-sidedly emphasized building timber forests, but not many were built, and even fewer survived. In recent years, they have summed up their experience and lessons, emphasizing that forestry should serve agriculture and the masses. In mountainous areas, they pay attention to building soil and water conservation forests; in sandy wasteland areas, they pay attention to building shelterbelts; in plain areas, they pay attention to building economic forests and planting trees "around the four sides". At the same time, they plan to establish timber forest bases, and combine the construction of soil and water conservation forests and shelterbelts to develop fast-growing timber tree species loved by the masses. As a result, last year alone, they afforested more than 3.8 million mu, more than double the previous years.
    Starting from the current urgent needs of the masses, combining short-term and long-term, and promoting long-term with short-term, from a temporary point of view, the development of timber forests will be slower in the first few years, but from a long-term point of view, doing so is more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, and is conducive to accumulating funds and experience, which can create conditions for the development of timber forests in the future. The timber forests mainly composed of fir, pine, and bamboo built in recent years in Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have been developed on the basis of solving the urgent needs of the masses.
    To run forestry for the people, we must fully consider the interests of the people, and especially important is to correctly handle the relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Chairman Mao taught that in developing production, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry should be placed in equally important positions. This conference introduced some successful experiences. Guangdong Province's experience in handling the relationship between agriculture and forestry is "to give way and to open the way," which correctly solved the contradiction between forestry and agriculture for land and labor, effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses for forest management, and afforested more than 6 million mu last year alone. Shandong Province adopted the method of "planting trees and raising pigs, raising pigs and fertilizing fields," which promoted mutual promotion of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province used the method of "three promotions," that is, promoting agriculture with forestry, promoting animal husbandry with forestry, and promoting sideline production with forestry, which was very popular among the masses and quickly changed the situation of lack of forests and trees.

      Afforestation, Forest Cultivation, and Forest Protection All Rely on the Masses
    To run forestry for the people, we must rely on the 500 million peasants to run forestry. This is the core issue of our development of forestry taking our own road.
    Representatives from many regions used their personal experiences to explain that whether it is seedling cultivation, afforestation, or forest cultivation and forest protection, only by resolutely relying on the masses can they be built well, cultivated well, and protected well. Among the national Dazhai-style agricultural typicals, Xia Dingjia Brigade in Shandong, Dianbai County in Guangdong, Fuyu County in Jilin, Pishan County in Xinjiang and other units are good examples of relying on the masses to achieve greening. This conference provided more examples and experiences of relying on the masses to rapidly develop forestry.
    Many representatives pointed out that not only should the collective afforestation cause rely on the masses, but also state-owned forest farms should rely on the masses and follow the mass line in forest management. Liangzhu Forest Farm in Heilongjiang Province is a newly built operating forest farm in 1963, with a total operating area of ​​210,000 mu, including more than 110,000 mu of secondary forest area, but only ten employees manage this forest farm. At the beginning of the establishment of the farm, they calculated that just the more than 110,000 mu of secondary forests would require more than 100 years for the ten employees of the farm to nurture it once. After discussion, everyone proposed to rely on the surrounding masses to run the forest farm. This winter, they adopted the method of both workers and farmers to organize the surrounding commune members to nurture more than 11,000 mu of secondary forests at once. The members of Liangzhu Commune who participated in forest nurturing not only earned a sum of cash, but also obtained a large amount of firewood and a batch of agricultural tool timber. They happily said: "Doing so is truly beneficial to the country, the people, the forest, and agriculture." Now, more than 1,400 state-owned forest farms and forestry management stations in Heilongjiang Province have adopted the method of both workers and farmers to nurture secondary forests. In the past three years, a total of more than 1.2 million mu of secondary forests have been nurtured, and the quality has also reached national requirements.
    The working people of our country have accumulated rich experience in planting trees and afforestation in their long-term production practice, especially in the struggle against natural disasters. To accelerate the development of forestry, we must learn to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and sum up the experience of the masses. Many representatives said that the forestry department should not only assign tasks to the masses from top to bottom, but more importantly, go to the masses to learn the scriptures and take treasures, and the scriptures and treasures taken from the masses are the most useful.

### 为人民办林业，依靠人民办林业——全国林业工作会议旁听记

    为人民办林业，依靠人民办林业
    ——全国林业工作会议旁听记
    目前林业还是我国国民经济建设中的一个薄弱环节，赶不上国家建设和人民生活的需要。如何尽快地改变这种状况，加速林业的发展？最近在北京举行的全国林业工作会议，对这个问题进行了认真地讨论和研究。
            发展林业要走自己的路
    我国发展林业的道路是什么？根据会议上代表们发表的意见，集中起来就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持群众路线，坚持自力更生，艰苦奋斗，坚持技术革命，大搞群众运动，全党全民办林业的道路。
    参加会议的代表例举大量事实证明，在过去十六年中，凡是按照这条道路办林业的地方，林业就得到迅速发展。不论造林、育林、护林和森林更新，都做出显著成绩。但是，有些地方也年年高喊造林，但造林不见林，甚至原有的森林资源也保护得不够好。
    为什么会出现这两种不同情况呢？代表们在讨论中提供的许多材料说明，问题的核心在于林业工作中是不是突出政治，是不是牢固地树立起为人民群众办林业，依靠人民群众办林业的思想。
    有人说，挖坑栽树，轻而易举，造林季节，一布置，一号召，谁还不能栽？可是，同样是挖坑栽树，有的栽得活，有的栽不活；有的造林成林，有的造林不成林。仅仅是因为土质、气候等自然条件不同吗？不！江苏代表在会上引用当地群众的两句话：“人换思想，地换装”，“红了心头，绿了山头”，说是这是他们发展林业的基本经验。他们的这条经验，也被其他一些地区的事实所验证。
            要敢于引远水解近渴
    发展林业，绿化祖国，是一场改造大自然的斗争。毛主席说，要改造客观世界，首先必须改造人的主观世界。在这场伟大斗争中，只有用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，首先进行一场思想革命，树立改天换地的雄心大志，才能不怕困难，敢于和善于同大自然斗争，才能把树栽活，把林造起来。
    有些人因为林业生产周期长、收益晚、易破坏、难恢复，便认为植树造林是“远水不解近渴”。可是全国著名的劳动模范李顺达却不这样看，他说：“干革命，就要敢于引远水解近渴！”他心中有这样的远大理想，敢于带领社员在土薄石厚的山区造林，头一年栽了三百亩，只活了一棵。他不泄气，说：“只要活一棵，就说明在这里栽树能活！”于是坚持造林，现已造了几千亩。
    许多林业建设先进地区和单位代表在介绍自己的经验时，都说“树木一定要先树人”。他们说，有了大寨人，才有大寨式农田；有了大庆人，才有大庆式油田；山上要有树，人就要有为革命而造林的思想。
    山东鄄城县是这次会议所表扬的林业先进典型单位之一。这个县的县委领导干部总结自己的切身体会说：“办林业，必须有革命理想、革命干劲和革命毅力；林业生产所需劳动量虽然比农业、水利小得多，但是它的思想工作量却比农业、水利大得多。”他们的经验说明，只有通过人的思想革命化，才能实现对大自然的革命。山西雁北专区的经验，广东湛江专区的经验，以及其他许多地区和单位的经验，都从不同地区和不同角度来证实这是一条普遍规律。
          首先做好政治工作
    要教育群众树立为革命造林的思想，各级林业领导部门，就必须突出政治，确立为人民办林业，依靠人民办林业的思想。对于这个根本问题，并不是所有林业干部都已经懂得了。有些从事林业工作的干部，三句话不离本行，开口是树，闭口是木材，就是打不动人心，动员不起来群众。有些同志在这次会议中间，学习了毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄同志的事迹以后，猛然醒悟，自我检讨说：过去自己的工作没做好，就是缺乏焦裕禄那种明确的一心为人民，一切依靠人民的思想。因此，有些同志提出，建设林业，必须靠政治，用政治统帅林业。在突出政治，做好政治思想工作的基础上抓林业，才能真正把林业抓上去。广东肇庆专区的一位领导干部说，一九六二年他们在郁南县南江公社建立国社合营的杉木林基地，由于没有突出政治，凭钱办事，造林一亩给群众十二元钱，结果钱花了，树没有长起来。后来，他们总结了经验教训，一九六四年又在同一个地方营造杉林，通过突出政治，向群众说明为谁造林，靠谁造林的道理，结果每亩林比上次少花一半钱，就造成了一片一万多亩的杉木林。
            从群众当前需要出发
    为人民群众办林业，就要在关心群众长远利益和根本利益的同时，从广大群众当前生产和生活迫切需要出发，统筹兼顾，全面安排每个时期的林业建设工作。
    但是，在这个问题上，过去存在着不同认识，有些人总是耽心从人民群众的生产生活迫切需要出发来发展林业，会影响生产国家建设需要的木材。然而，这次会议上介绍的许多林业先进地区的经验表明，因地制宜地从群众的生产生活迫切需要出发来造林营林，可以兼顾国家、集体和个人三者的利益，是群众所乐为的多快好省发展林业的一个重要途径。河北省有些地方过去片面强调营造用材林，造的不多，成活的更少。近年来，他们总结了经验教训，强调林业要为农业服务，为群众服务，在山区重视营造水土保持林，在沙荒地区重视造防护林，在平原地区重视造经济林和“四旁”植树，同时，有计划地建立用材林基地，并结合水土保持林和防护林的营造，发展群众喜爱的速生用材树种，结果去年一年就造林三百八十多万亩，比前几年增加一倍多。
    从群众当前迫切需要出发，长短结合，以短促长，从暂时看，头几年用材林的发展要慢一些，但从长远看，这样做更有利于调动群众造林的积极性，有利于积累资金和经验，可以为以后发展用材林创造条件。广东、湖南、江西等省，近几年来营造的以杉、松、竹为主的用材林，就是在解决群众迫切需要问题的基础上发展起来的。
    为人民群众办林业，就要全面考虑人民群众的利益，特别重要的是正确处理农、林、牧的关系。毛主席教导说，在发展生产中，要把农、林、牧放在同等重要的地位。这次会议上介绍了一些成功经验。广东省处理农林关系的经验是“要让路，又要开路”，正确地解决了林业和农业争土地、争劳力的矛盾，有效地调动群众的营林积极性，去年一年就造林六百多万亩。山东省采用“种树养猪、养猪肥田”的办法，使农林牧互相促进。山西省雁北专区用“三促”的办法，即以林促农，以林促牧，以林促副，很受群众的欢迎，迅速改变了缺林少树的状况。
      造林、育林、护林都要依靠群众
    要为人民办林业，就要依靠五亿农民办林业。这是我们发展林业走自己道路的核心问题。
    许多地区的代表都用亲身体会，说明不论是育苗、造林，还是育林、护林、只有坚决依靠群众，才能造好、育好、护好。全国大寨式农业典型中，山东下丁家大队，广东电白县，吉林扶余县，新疆皮山县等单位，都是依靠群众实现绿化的好榜样。这次会议提供了更多的依靠群众迅速发展林业的事例和经验。
    许多代表提出，不仅集体造林事业要依靠群众，国营林场在营林中，也要依靠群众，走群众路线。黑龙江省亮珠林场是一九六三年新建的一个经营林场，经营总面积二十一万亩，其中次生林面积十一万多亩，却只有十个职工管理这个林场。建场初期，他们算了一笔账，单是十一万多亩次生林，光靠十个本场职工来抚育，需要一百多年才能抚育一遍。大家经过讨论，提出要依靠周围群众办林场。这年冬天，他们采取亦工亦农的办法，组织周围社员一次就抚育次生林一万一千多亩。参加森林抚育工作的亮珠公社社员们不仅收入一笔现金，还得到大量烧柴和一批农具用材。他们高兴地说：“这样做，真是利国、利民，利林，又利农。”现在，黑龙江省已有一千四百多个国营林场、林业管理站采取亦工亦农的办法抚育次生林，三年来，共抚育次生林一百二十多万亩，质量也达到国家要求。
    我国劳动人民在长期的生产实践中，特别是在同自然灾害作斗争中，积累了丰富的植树造林的经验。要加速林业的发展，就必须学会集中群众的智慧，总结群众的经验。不少代表说，林业部门不应当光是自上而下地向群众布置任务，更重要的是到群众中去取经、取宝，从群众中取来的经，取来的宝才最有用处。
