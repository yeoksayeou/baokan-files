    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th) The Chinese Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble held the closing ceremony of its performance tour in Vietnam at the Hanoi Grand Theatre on the evening of the 17th.

    Among those attending the closing ceremony were Pham Ngoc Thuan, Director of the Vietnamese Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, Qu Huy Can, Deputy Minister of Culture, Son Quang Phac, Vice President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, as well as Zhu Qiwu, Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, and Du Zhanchao, Cultural Counselor of the Embassy.

    At the closing ceremony, the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble performed nearly twenty Chinese and Vietnamese songs, dances, and musical programs, which were warmly welcomed. At the enthusiastic request of the audience, many actors danced and sang one more song for the heroic Vietnamese comrades. The atmosphere at the event was filled with profound militant friendship.

    Zhang Xing, head of the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble, said at the closing ceremony that the militant solidarity and great friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam cannot be undermined by anyone or any force. The Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble, along with the 650 million Chinese people, will forever fight alongside the fraternal Vietnamese people, resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism, and fight until final victory.

    Phan Huy Le, Deputy Director of the Music and Dance Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, on behalf of the Vietnamese Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations and the Ministry of Culture, warmly praised the success of the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble's visit and performances in Vietnam. He said that every program performed by the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble vividly embodies the revolutionary and militant art of China, illuminated by Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. The programs created and performed by the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble on the subject of Vietnam's resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are heroic odes to the heroic fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people and are shells fired at the American aggressors and their running dogs. He also said that this friendly visit and performance tour to Vietnam by the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble has made a due contribution to encouraging the Vietnamese soldiers and civilians to more resolutely defeat the American aggressors and to further enhancing the militant solidarity between the fraternal Vietnamese and Chinese peoples.

    The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an article on the 17th, warmly praising the songs and dances performed by the Chinese Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble in Vietnam as songs and dances overflowing with the militant friendship between Vietnam and China. The article said that the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble's creations and performances are based on our people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and every program is a profound friendship and wholehearted support for our people.

    On the evening of the 16th, a special performance was held at the Hanoi Grand Theatre in support of the struggle of the people of South Vietnam against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th) The Chinese Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble, which is currently on a performance tour in Vietnam, has recently traveled to various parts of northern Vietnam for more than half a month, giving more than eighty consolation performances for soldiers and civilians in thirteen provinces. They were warmly welcomed and praised by the vast number of soldiers and civilians in Vietnam during their journey of more than 2,000 kilometers. The Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble, starting from February 21, was divided into three performance teams and left Hanoi to go to various parts of northern Vietnam. The actors, unafraid of enemy bombing and long journeys, performed enthusiastically for the heroic Vietnamese people with a fighting spirit. They performed in concentrated areas where audiences could gather, and they performed in scattered areas where audiences could not gather, bringing songs and dances filled with the profound friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples to their doorsteps, performing several shows a day.

    On the anti-aircraft artillery positions in the smoke-filled provinces of Nghe An and Thanh Hoa, on the steel transportation lines leading to the front, in the squares of industrial areas such as Nam Dinh, Viet Tri, and Thai Nguyen, in the towering mountains and ridges of Cao Bang and Ha Giang provinces, which are connected to China by mountains and rivers, and in the forests of Bac Thai, Tuyen Quang, and Phu Tho provinces, where ethnic minorities live, the footprints of the members of the Chinese Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble were left everywhere, and the songs of friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people spread everywhere. The Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble also visited President Ho Chi Minh's hometown—Kim Lien commune in Nghe An province—and performed for the local soldiers and civilians.

    During the visit and performances, the song and dance troupe was warmly welcomed by the soldiers and civilians in various parts of northern Vietnam. Leading officials from local Party, government, and military departments cordially met with the song and dance troupe. When the masses in many places heard the news of the arrival of the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble, they spread the word and regarded it as good news. They walked dozens of kilometers, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, to welcome the song and dance troupe sent by the fraternal Chinese people and watch their performances. When performing in Vinh Phuc, Cao Bang, and other places, it rained, but the enthusiastic audience was unwilling to leave and watched in the rain. After each performance, soldiers and civilians in various parts of Vietnam excitedly shouted, "Long live the militant friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples!" (Attached photos)

    越南文化部音乐舞蹈司副司长潘辉黎代表越南对外文化联络委员会和文化部热烈赞扬东方歌舞团在越南访问演出的成功。他说，东方歌舞团演出的每一个节目都非常鲜明地体现了在毛泽东文艺思想光辉照耀下的中国富有革命性和战斗性的艺术。由东方歌舞团创作和演出的关于越南抗美救国题材的节目，是表现越南人民英勇战斗精神的英雄赞歌，是打向美国侵略强盗及其走狗的炮弹。他还说，东方歌舞团这次对越南进行的友好访问演出，对鼓舞越南军民更坚决地击败美国侵略强盗、对进一步增强兄弟的越中两国人民的战斗团结作出了应有的贡献。

    据新华社河内十四日电正在越南访问演出的中国东方歌舞团，在最近半个多月中分赴越南北方各地，为十三个省的军民进行了八十多场慰问演出。他们在两千多公里的行程中，受到了越南广大军民的热烈欢迎和称赞。东方歌舞团从二月二十一日起，分成三个演出队，离开河内，奔赴越南北方各地。演员们不畏敌机的轰炸，长途跋涉，以战斗的姿态，热情地为英雄的越南人民演出。他们在观众能集中观看的地方就集中演，观众不能集中的地方就分散演，把洋溢着深厚的中越人民友谊的歌舞节目送上门去，一天演出好几场。
    在硝烟弥漫的义安、清化等省的高射炮阵地上，在通向前方的钢铁运输线上，在南定、越池、太原等工业区的广场上，在同中国山水相连的高平、河江等省的崇山峻岭间，在少数民族聚居的北太、宣光、富寿等省的树林里，到处都留下了中国东方歌舞团团员的足迹，到处传遍了中越人民友谊的歌声。东方歌舞团还访问了胡志明主席的故乡——义安省金莲乡，并且为当地军民进行了演出。
    在访问演出期间，歌舞团受到越南北方各地军民的热情欢迎。各地党政军负责人都亲切地接见歌舞团。许多地方的群众在听到东方歌舞团到来的消息时，便奔走相告，传为喜讯。他们步行数十公里，翻山涉水，赶来欢迎兄弟的中国人民派来的歌舞团，并观看他们的演出。在永福、高平等地演出时，天下起雨来，热情的观众们不愿离开，冒雨观看。每次演出以后，越南各地军民都激奋地高呼“越中人民的战斗友谊万岁！”（附图片）
