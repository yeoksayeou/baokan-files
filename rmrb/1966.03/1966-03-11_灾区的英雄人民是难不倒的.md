    The Heroic People in Disaster Areas Are Undaunted
    In the Xingtai area of Hebei Province, a strong earthquake occurred, causing varying degrees of damage to people, livestock, and housing. We extend our deepest sympathies to the local people who are bravely fighting against the natural disaster!
    After the earthquake disaster, the Party Central Committee and the State Council were extremely concerned and immediately mobilized and organized enormous manpower and resources to carry out disaster relief work. The Central慰问团慰问团慰问团慰问团慰问团慰问团慰问团Comfort Group rushed to the disaster area to express condolences to the affected people. The North China Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, and the local garrison forces fully devoted themselves to disaster relief work. The people of neighboring counties in the disaster area, displaying the spirit of mutual assistance—when one place suffers, all places help—gave the greatest support to the people in the disaster area. We extend our heartfelt respect to the cadres at all levels, commanders and fighters, medical personnel, financial and trade personnel, transportation personnel, and all relevant personnel who participated in the disaster relief work with selfless spirit!
    In a situation where it is impossible for human power to completely control nature, it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of such natural disasters here and there. However, in the face of natural disasters, the people of our country are no longer as helpless as they were in the old society; under the leadership of the Party and the government, we are fully capable of carrying out organized disaster relief struggles. After this earthquake disaster occurred, all relevant parties immediately entered the tense disaster relief work with a tenacious fighting attitude, once again fully demonstrating the superiority of our socialist system, fully demonstrating the high revolutionary consciousness and strong unity of the vast number of cadres and people in our country.
    The support from the Central Committee and all parties has made the people in the disaster area feel extremely warm and greatly encouraged. Although they are currently facing great difficulties in production and life, no difficulty can overwhelm the heroic people in the disaster area. Under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, the people in the disaster area are full of confidence and are carrying out a tenacious struggle against the natural disaster. We believe that as long as we closely rely on the masses of the people, carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, actively engage in production and self-help, and pay attention to arranging the lives of the masses, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "How have human beings lived since ancient times? Haven't they been living by their own hands?" The creativity of the masses of the people is boundless. With the correct leadership of our Party, the people in the disaster area can rely on their own hands to overcome the disaster caused by this earthquake, produce better, and live better.

    灾区的英雄人民是难不倒的
    河北省邢台地区，发生强烈地震，人、畜、房屋遭受不同程度的损失。我们谨向正在同自然灾害进行顽强斗争的当地人民群众，表示深切的慰问！
    这次地震灾害发生以后，党中央和国务院极为关怀，立即动员、组织了巨大的人力物力，开展救灾工作。中央慰问团迅速赶到灾区，慰问受灾人民。华北局、河北省委、河北省人民委员会以及当地驻军，全力投入救灾工作。灾区邻近各县人民，发扬一方有灾、四方来帮的互助精神，给予灾区人民最大的支援。我们谨向以忘我精神参加救灾工作的各级干部、指战员、医疗人员、财贸工作人员、交通运输人员以及全体有关人员，致以衷心的敬意！
    在人力还不可能完全控制自然的情况下，这里那里发生这种那种自然灾害，是难于避免的。但是，在自然灾害面前，我们国家的人民已经不象旧社会那样无能为力；我们在党和政府领导下，完全能够进行有组织的抗灾斗争。这次地震灾害发生以后，各个有关方面，立即以顽强的战斗姿态，投入紧张的救灾工作，再一次充分显示了我们社会主义制度的优越性，充分显示了我国广大干部和人民群众高度的革命觉悟和坚强的团结。
    中央和各方的支援，使灾区人民感到无比的温暖，受到极大的鼓舞。他们目前在生产和生活方面虽然有着很大的困难，但是，任何困难，都压不倒灾区的英雄人民。在当地党政机关领导下，灾区人民满怀信心，同自然灾害展开顽强的斗争。我们相信，只要紧紧依靠人民群众，发扬自力更生精神，积极生产自救，注意安排群众生活，就一定可以战胜一切困难。
    毛泽东同志说过，“从古以来的人类究竟是怎样生活着的呢？还不是自己动手活下去的么？”人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的。有了我们党的正确领导，灾区人民依靠自己的双手，完全可以战胜这次地震造成的灾害，生产得更好，生活得更好。
