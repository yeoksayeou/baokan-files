    (Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, March 15) France's formal announcement of its withdrawal from the military "integration" of the North Atlantic Group has placed the foreign policy of the West German Erhard government in a new predicament.

    In recent days, West German newspapers have been rife with discussion, stating that France has dealt a "heavy blow" to the North Atlantic Group and expressing "little confidence" in whether the group can find a "way out." West German Chancellor Erhard was also greatly shaken, convening not only a cabinet meeting but also holding consultations with the Defense Committee, relevant government departments, and parliamentary groups of various political parties to seek countermeasures. A West German government spokesman said on the 9th that this matter is of "particular concern to West Germany." Basel, chairman of the parliamentary group of the ruling Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, also said that France has put West Germany "into a severe situation that is suffocating" and that this problem "must be taken very seriously."

    The spearhead of France's action is mainly directed at the US "hegemony" in Western Europe. The fact that it has aroused such a strong reaction in Bonn is because the North Atlantic Group is both a stepping stone for West Germany's attempt to climb to the status of a major power and a shield to cover up the ambitious West German militarism in front of its Western European "allies." In his policy statement after taking office last year, Erhard announced that "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the foundation of West Germany's defense policy."

    At the same time, the fierce struggle between France and the United States over the North Atlantic Group has made it increasingly difficult for the Erhard government to continue playing its usual diplomatic game: pursuing a policy of aligning with the United States while also seeking the support and cooperation of France. *The General News* stated in an editorial on the 10th regarding this predicament of the West German government: "The end of Bonn's balancing act is in sight."

    Now, although spokesmen for the Bonn government have repeatedly emphasized that West Germany will never abandon the North Atlantic Group and its military "integration," and even said that "a North Atlantic Treaty Organization without France is better than no organization at all," Basel, who holds considerable power in the West German ruling clique, has already revealed the true intentions of the West German ruling clique on the 15th. He said: "The question now is: how to maintain as much of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as possible while maintaining as much unity with France as possible." Basel hopes that West Germany can work with its "friends" in the North Atlantic Group to find a "compromise solution." However, the West German *General News* pointed out that if Erhard "catered to De Gaulle's wishes," it would "deal the Americans a blow on the head"; but if he "sided with Johnson," it would "provoke De Gaulle's anger."

### 戴高乐向美国挑战使西德外交政策左右为难  艾哈德无法再在美法之间保持平衡

    戴高乐向美国挑战使西德外交政策左右为难
    艾哈德无法再在美法之间保持平衡
    据新华社波恩十五日电　法国正式宣布要退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”，这种行径使西德艾哈德政府的外交政策面临新的困难。
    连日来，西德报纸议论纷纷，说法国使北大西洋集团遭到“沉重打击”，并且对这个集团能否找到“出路”表示“难有信心”。西德总理艾哈德也大为震动，他不仅为此召开了内阁会议，而且还分别同国防委员会、政府有关各部以及各政党议会党团进行磋商，谋求对策。西德政府发言人九日说，这件事情“特别关系到西德”。执政党基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟议会党团主席巴泽尔也说，法国使西德“陷入了使人喘不过气来的严重境况”，“必须十分认真地对待”这个问题。
    法国这一行动的矛头主要针对美国在西欧的“霸权”。它竟然在波恩引起如此强烈的反应，是因为北大西洋集团既是西德企图借以爬上大国地位的垫脚石，也是在西欧“盟国”面前为野心勃勃的西德军国主义打掩护的盾牌。艾哈德在去年上台后发表的施政纲领中宣布：“北大西洋公约组织是西德防务政策的基础”。
    同时，法美两国围绕北大西洋集团问题的激烈斗争，还使艾哈德政府越来越难于继续玩弄它的一贯外交手法：既要执行以投靠美国为主的方针，又要得到法国的支持和合作。《总汇报》十日在社论中谈到西德政府这种窘态说：“波恩这种平衡手法的末日已经在望。”
    现在，尽管波恩政府的发言人多次强调西德决不放弃北大西洋集团及其军事“一体化”，甚至说什么“有一个无法国的北大西洋公约组织要比没有这个组织好”，但是在西德统治集团中颇有势力的巴泽尔已经在十五日泄露了西德统治集团真正的心事。他说：“现在的问题在于：既要尽可能多地保持北大西洋公约组织，又要尽可能多地保持同法国的一致。”巴泽尔希望，西德能够同它在北大西洋集团中的“朋友”一起找到一个“折衷的解决办法”。但是，西德《总汇报》指出，艾哈德如果“迎合戴高乐的愿望”，就会“给美国人当头一棒”；而如果“同约翰逊一起”，又会“招致戴高乐发火”。
