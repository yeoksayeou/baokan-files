    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The Sato government forced the passage of the draft national budget for fiscal year 1966 and the fiscal investment and loan program, the largest since the war, through a plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives on the evening of the 5th.
    It is reported that at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the evening of the 5th, Japanese Communist Party Diet members resolutely opposed the Sato government's new budget and fiscal investment and loan plan, which attempted to escape serious economic difficulties by cruelly plundering the people and stepping up foreign expansion. Socialist Party Diet members also expressed opposition to the government's budget draft and proposed a motion to recompile the budget.
    According to the Japanese government's announcement, the national budget for fiscal year 1966 is 4,314.27 billion yen, an increase of approximately 18 percent over the previous year. The fiscal investment and loan plan carried out by the government in the form of state capital to monopoly capital amounts to 2,027.2 billion yen, an increase of more than 25 percent over the previous year. In order to scrape together financial funds for this year's budget and loan plan, the Sato government issued "deficit bonds" for the first time since the war.
    Japanese newspapers and periodicals pointed out that the Sato government's claim that the new, huge budget is to "stabilize" the people's lives is completely deceptive. In the budget and fiscal investment and loan plan, the Japanese government, on the one hand, uses methods such as increasing taxes, raising public utility fees, and issuing 1.5 trillion to 2 trillion yen of "deficit bonds" to plunder the people in order to make up for the financial difficulties. On the other hand, investments in "public works" amount to as high as 2,070 billion yen. This huge investment is mainly for the construction of roads, harbors, bridges, and high-end residences, etc., in order to sell overproduced steel, cement, and other commodities for monopoly capital.
    In the budget, direct military spending is 340.6 billion yen, an increase of 40 billion yen over the previous year. In addition, there are indirect expenses such as rocket research expenses and military engineering expenses.
    Japanese economist Kihachiro Kimura recently published an article pointing out that from the perspective of modern Japanese history, the Japanese government's issuance of large amounts of "deficit bonds" is always inextricably linked to the launching of wars.

### 日本国会强行通过搜刮民财的庞大预算  日本经济学家揭露佐藤政府发行赤字公债是为了准备战争

    日本国会强行通过搜刮民财的庞大预算
    日本经济学家揭露佐藤政府发行赤字公债是为了准备战争
    据新华社讯　东京消息：佐藤政府在五日晚上强使日本众议院全体会议通过了战后以来空前庞大的一九六六年度国家预算草案和财政投资贷款计划。
    据报道，在五日晚上的众议院全体会议上，日本共产党国会议员坚决反对佐藤政府企图以残酷掠夺人民和加紧对外扩张的办法，来摆脱严重的经济困难的新的预算和财政投资贷款计划。社会党国会议员也表示反对政府的预算草案，并且提出了重新编制预算的动议。
    据日本政府公布，一九六六年度的国家预算为四万三千一百四十二亿七千万日元，比去年度大约增加了百分之十八。由政府以国家资本方式向垄断资本进行财政投资贷款计划，达二万零二百七十二亿日元，比去年度增加了百分之二十五以上。为了给本年度预算和贷款计划搜刮财政资金，佐藤政府战后第一次发行了“赤字公债”。
    日本报刊指出，佐藤政府说什么新的庞大的预算是为了“稳定”人民生活，完全是骗人的。日本政府在预算和财政投资贷款计划中，一方面用加重税收、提高公用事业费用和发行一万五千亿到二万亿日元的“赤字公债”等办法，向人民大肆搜刮以弥补财源的困窘；另一方面对“公共事业”的投资高达二万零七百亿日元，这笔巨额投资主要是为了修建道路、港湾、桥梁和高级住宅等，以便为垄断资本销售严重生产过剩的钢铁、水泥等商品。
    在预算中，直接军费为三千四百零六亿日元，比去年度增加四百亿日元。此外还有火箭研究费、军事工程费等间接费用等。
    日本著名的经济学家木村禧八郎最近发表文章指出，从日本现代史来看，日本政府发行大量的“赤字公债”总是与发动战争有着不可分割的关系。
