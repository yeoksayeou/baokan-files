    Vivid Images, Moving Art
    Bian Shanji
    The color animated film "Prairie Heroic Little Sisters" is adapted from the true story of two Mongolian girls, Longmei and Yurong, from Darhan Muminggan United Banner, Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia, who braved wind and snow to rescue the commune's sheep. Using the unique animation form of fine arts film to represent true people and events was rare in the past. This film is a new achievement of fine arts film workers in highlighting politics after the Cultural Revolution.
    A significant feature of "Prairie Heroic Little Sisters" in its creation lies first and foremost in the fact that the authors grasped the heart-stirring ideological core of this event: two Mongolian girls, in the severe cold of minus thirty-seven degrees, traveled more than seventy miles and fought heroically against the sudden blizzard in order to protect the commune's sheep flock. What force supported them in generating such amazing perseverance? The film tells us: it is "bitter in the past, sweet today" – class education has taken root in the children's hearts; it is "learn from Uncle Lei Feng" – collectivist thinking has blossomed in the children's hearts; it is the result of socialist ideological education received by children in the Mao Zedong era.
    The content of the film's selected subject matter mainly depicts the heroic little sisters Longmei and Yurong, who, for the sake of the collective cause, disregarded their own safety, and bravely and tenaciously launched a battle against natural disasters. From the perspective of the play's structure, the plot is relatively simple and the actions are relatively straightforward. How to profoundly reveal the ideological character of the characters from simple dramatic actions and reach a touching level is a difficult problem for the film's creation. The film's authors did a good job in solving this problem. In the design of the image and actions of the screen, not only did they creatively use almost realistic modeling methods adapted to the content of this subject matter, but they also supplemented them with "accompanying singing" and a form of expression that highlights the characters' inner monologues, which vividly set off the atmosphere of the environment and vividly depicted the glorious images of the two little heroines.
    The scene in which Longmei and Yurong resist the blizzard is handled very touchingly. The film did not limit itself to the generally exaggerated expression techniques of past animated films, but instead, starting entirely from life, after appropriate artistic processing, expressed the little protagonists' spirit of wholeheartedly serving the public and their fearless character of "not being afraid of the severe cold and not being afraid of wind and snow." When the storm came, dark clouds rolled, and the sheep struggled to move forward against the strong wind; the first few sheep couldn't withstand the attack of the strong wind, turned their heads and ran with the wind, Longmei and Yurong bravely waved their whips to block them.... Obviously, these picture designs, whether it is the close-up of "dark clouds rolling" and "strong wind howling" or the seemingly simple actions of "sheep stampeding" and "sisters blocking," because the film's authors have always placed the characters in the active position of fighting against the blizzard, therefore, after watching it, people still feel that the image is vivid and the momentum is heroic, and the artistic effect of "real and touching" that was difficult to achieve in the past animated films has been obtained.
    In order to further highlight the spiritual outlook of the characters, the authors also meticulously portrayed many moving plots in the process of the heroic little sisters protecting the sheep. For example, Yurong, because of her eagerness to protect the sheep, even if the felt shoes on her feet were trapped in the snow, she still chased the sheep and trudged and ran on the snowy ground for dozens of miles. Longmei telling Yurong the "Story of Uncle Lei Feng" while sheltering from the wind in the mountain pass, as well as the detailed depiction of the sisters encouraging each other in hunger and cold, all promoted the progress of the play and deepened the characterization of the characters. In particular, the details of sheltering from the wind in the mountain pass and telling stories, wrote out the source of the characters' spiritual strength.
    In addition, the film has also made beneficial explorations in the combination of animation art style and national and local characteristics. For example, the character modeling of Longmei and Yurong has broken through the original design of animated film characters similar to "dolls," but is rich in national characteristics, and focuses on expressing the characters' spiritual temperament. Longmei's magnanimity and simplicity, and Yurong's cleverness and liveliness, all enriched the characters' personality colors from the outline of their appearance and lines.
    Of course, further requirements are that there are still some shortcomings in the animation design. For example, the modeling of the mass images is more general, and it does not appear full enough, and it does not show the temperament of the herders. Also, will the sheep always maintain an orderly formation when they are frightened in the wind and snow, as they are currently shown? In terms of skill mastery, there are also some tremors in some pictures and actions. But despite this, these shortcomings do not detract from the achievements made by the entire film in terms of ideology and art. (Attached picture)

    生动的形象  感人的艺术

    彩色动画片《草原英雄小姊妹》是根据内蒙古乌兰察布盟达茂联合旗两个蒙族小姑娘——龙梅和玉荣冒着风雪，抢救公社羊群的真实事迹编写的。用美术电影特有的动画形式表现真人真事，过去还不多见。这部影片是美术电影工作者在文化革命之后，突出政治所获得的新成果。
    《草原英雄小姊妹》在创作上的一个显著特色，首先在于作者抓住了这个事件震撼人心的思想核心：两个蒙族小姑娘为了救护公社羊群，在零下三十七度的严寒下，奔波七十余里，与突然袭来的暴风雪进行了英勇的斗争。是什么力量支持她们产生如此惊人的毅力？影片告诉我们：是“往日苦，今日甜”——阶级教育在孩子心里扎了根；是“向雷锋叔叔学习”——集体主义思想在孩子心里开了花；是毛泽东时代的儿童受到社会主义思想教育的结果。
    影片选择的题材内容，主要是表现龙梅、玉荣两位小英雄为了集体事业，奋不顾身，英勇顽强地向自然灾害展开搏斗的情景。从戏的结构来看，剧情较为单纯，动作也比较简单。如何从单纯的戏剧动作中深刻地揭示人物的思想性格，达到感人的程度，这是影片创作的一个难题。电影作者在解决这个难题上，做得比较好。在画面形象和动作设计上，不但创造性地运用了与这个题材内容相适应的近于写实的造型手段，而且还辅之以“伴唱”和突出人物内心独白的表现形式，既生动地烘托了环境气氛，又栩栩如生地描绘了两个小英雄的光辉形象。
    龙梅、玉荣抵抗暴风雪的那场戏，处理得很感人。影片没有局限于过去动画片一般夸张的表现手法，而是完全从生活出发，经过适当艺术加工，表现了小主人公一心为公的精神，和她们那种“不怕严寒，不怕风雪”的无畏性格。风暴来临，乌云滚滚，羊群顶着狂风艰难地向前移动；前面几只羊顶不住狂风袭击，调转头来顺着风势跑，龙梅、玉荣勇敢地挥鞭拦挡……。显然，这些画面设计，不论是“乌云滚滚”、“狂风呼啸”的“空镜头”特写，还是“羊群惊窜”、“姐妹拦挡”的看来比较单一的动作，由于电影作者始终把人物置于与暴风雪搏斗的主动地位，因此看后还是让人感到形象生动、气势豪迈，获得了过去动画片很难达到的“真实、感人”的艺术效果。
    作者为了进一步突出人物的精神面貌，在英雄小姊妹护羊过程中，还细致地刻划了不少动人的情节。例如玉荣由于护羊心切，即使脚上的毡鞋陷落在雪地里，她还是照样追赶羊群，在长达几十里的雪地上跋涉奔跑。龙梅在山坳避风时向玉荣讲《雷锋叔叔的故事》，以及姐妹俩在饥寒中互相鼓励的细节描绘，都推进了戏的进展和加深了人物的刻划。特别是山坳避风、讲故事的细节，写出了人物精神力量的来源。
    此外，影片在动画艺术风格与民族地方色彩的结合上，也做了有益的探索。例如龙梅、玉荣的人物造型，就突破了原来动画片人物类似“洋娃娃”的设计，而是富于民族特色，并且着重表现人物的精神气质。龙梅的浑厚、淳朴，玉荣的机灵、活泼，都从外形、线条的勾勒上丰富了人物性格色彩。
    当然，进一步要求，在动画设计上也还存在着一些缺点。比如群众形象的造型就较一般，看来不够丰满，显不出牧民的气质。又如羊群在风雪中惊走，是否会象现在表现的那样始终保持着整齐的队伍？在技巧掌握上，有些画面、动作也还有若干抖动之处。但尽管如此，这些不足的地方，是无损于整部影片在思想上、艺术上获得的成就的。（附图片）
