    Two Interpretations of One Noun
    One teacher explained the meaning of "prison" to students, saying, "A prison is a place where criminals are locked up." Another teacher, from the viewpoint of class struggle, explained the term this way: "Chairman Mao said, 'The state apparatus, including the army, police, and courts, are instruments of class oppression.' The prisons of the reactionaries are used to suppress the revolutionary people, while our prisons are used to suppress the enemies of the people."
    The former teacher thought that as long as the meaning of the word was explained clearly, that would be enough, and didn't connect it with politics. The latter teacher understood that they were training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and that it was more important to cultivate students into people with correct political viewpoints than simply to teach them knowledge. Therefore, they were able to stand on the proletariat's position and correctly explain the meaning of the word "prison" to the students.

      Editor's Note: When explaining the word "prison," those holding a purely professional viewpoint explain it only in terms of its literal meaning; those with a political mind explain it from the viewpoint of class struggle. Different interpretations produce different effects. From this, it can be seen that emphasizing politics and arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought is extremely important for everyone.

### 一个名词两种解释

    一个名词两种解释
    有一个教师给学生解释“监狱”的意思，说：“监狱就是关犯人的地方。”另一个教师从阶级斗争观点解释这个词，说：“毛主席说：‘军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具’。反动派的监狱是用来镇压革命人民的，我们的监狱是用来镇压人民的敌人的。”
    前一个教师以为只要把这个词儿的意思解释清楚就行了，没有把它同政治联系起来。后一个教师懂得自己是在培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，不但要教给学生知识，更重要的是要把学生培养成为具有正确的政治观点的人，因而就能够站在无产阶级的立场上，向学生正确解释“监狱”这个词的意思。

      编者注：同是解释“监狱”这个词，抱着单纯业务观点的人，只从字面上作解释；有政治头脑的人，则从阶级斗争的观点作解释。不同的解释，产生不同的效果。由此看来，突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，对每个人都是十分重要的。
