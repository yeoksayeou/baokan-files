    The Suona Sound on the Reservoir Construction Site
    Ye Nan
    In the early winter afternoon, the northerly wind howled. At our commune's reservoir construction site, the commune members were still working hard. The commune secretary swung his large hoe and stood at the forefront of the digging team. Dump trucks followed one after another, like a non-stop conveyor belt. This was another battle after the busy autumn harvest. We wanted to complete the excavation work of the reservoir before the ground froze.
      "Old Le is here!" Someone in the crowd noticed and shouted happily:
      "It's Old Le!"
      "The culture cart is here--"
    I looked up and saw a person pushing a cart, running along the river embankment below the reservoir construction site. I had never met Old Le, but I had heard the commune members talk about him. In the old society, he was a well-known hired hand in this area. He was famous not only because he was good at farming work, but also because he was an outstanding folk musician. He could play almost all folk instruments, and he was most skilled at playing the suona. Some people said that when he played festive tunes, everyone would smile; when he played sad tunes, even stone statues would shed tears. After liberation, he was transferred to the county cultural center to do rural cultural mobilization work. The organization specially trained him to learn culture, and now he is even more versatile. According to the commune members, he could speak impromptu poetry and compose music on the spot. He spent his days pushing his cart around the villages, delivering spiritual food to the commune members. He became a folk art fighter loved by the vast number of rural commune members. Now that he's here, of course people welcome him!
    He put down the cart and waved to everyone: "Comrades, work harder, let's all compete. Everyone should be a new Yugong, building a good socialist homeland. Come on! Dig out ten thousand cubic meters of soil this year, and harvest ten thousand more dan next year!" His voice was so loud and pleasant. As he spoke, he snatched a dump truck and rushed into the crowd.
    When Old Le passed in front of me pushing the truck, I saw his face clearly: a pair of thick eyebrows, a pair of bright eyes shining with wisdom, and a kind, happy smile on his face. His shoulders were strong and powerful, and he pushed the hundreds of pounds of the truck with brisk steps.
    When the break time came, people immediately flocked to Old Le and his cart like a tide, clamoring:
      "Let's see what Old Le has brought us!"
    "Let Old Le tell us a story!"
    "Let Old Le play us a tune!"
    Old Le raised his head and said loudly:
    "Comrades, this time I've specially brought you the best gift - 'Wholeheartedly for the Revolution'." As he said, he picked up a book from the cart and held it up high, "This is the diary of Lei Feng-style fighter Comrade Wang Jie, it just arrived today." Before he finished speaking, people crowded up, and soon all the books on the cart were taken. People cherishedly stroked the red cover of the book, gazing at Comrade Wang Jie's heroic face on the cover.
    Someone requested:
    "Comrade Old Le, tell us more about Wang Jie's story!"
      "Yes!" Many people echoed.
    Old Le readily said:
    "Okay, I'll tell you all!"
    Old Le was very good at telling stories. He spoke in a simple, clear, and unadorned way, and it had a surprising effect. I saw: the old people nodding frequently, the women wiping away their excited tears, and the young men blushing and clenching their fists.
    The moment he finished speaking, there was no movement. Everyone was still immersed in the memory of Comrade Wang Jie and in thinking about how to treat life in the future. At this time, the commune secretary said to everyone: "Comrades, how should we learn from Comrade Wang Jie?"
      "We should study Chairman Mao's works well!"
      "We will complete this reservoir project ahead of schedule!"
      "We must strive to build a new socialist countryside!"
    No one announced that the break time was over, and everyone automatically returned to their posts and picked up their tools. At this time, Old Le picked up another dump truck. The commune secretary came over and stopped him, saying:
      "Old Le, put down the truck, take out the suona, and give everyone some more encouragement!"
    "Okay! I will." Old Le agreed, put down the truck, took out the suona from his cart, stood on the high embankment, and began to play.
    The sound of the suona was like a waterfall leaping down, like a river rushing thousands of miles, like a bugle call encouraging the soldiers to charge. It inspired people to move forward! Forward! The crowds on the construction site stepped up their pace and accelerated the rhythm of their work. The sound of splitting rocks and digging soil, the rhythmic sound of tamping, the chanting of work songs, combined with the sound of the suona to form a magnificent movement. The hoes flashed with silver light, the tampers jumped, the wheels spun quickly, the earth trembled, and thousands of troops and horses attacked nature.

    水库工地上的唢呐声
    叶楠
    初冬的下午，小北风呼呼地刮着。在我们公社的水库工地上，社员们仍在紧张地劳动。公社书记抡起大镢站在挖土队伍的最前列。推土小车一辆接着一辆，象是不停歇的传送带。这是三秋大忙后的又一次战斗。我们要争取在封土以前完成水库的挖土工程。
      “老乐来了！”人群中不知是谁发现了，接着很多人都欢快地叫了起来：
      “是老乐！”
      “文化小车来了——”
    我抬头一看，只见一个人推着一辆小车，沿着水库工地下面的河堤飞奔而来。我没见过老乐，不过却听到社员们谈起过他的事情。在旧社会，他是这一带出名的雇工。他之所以出名，一方面是因为他是干庄稼活儿的好手，另一方面因为他还是一位出色的民间乐手。民间乐器他差不多全会摆弄，最精的一门是吹唢呐。有人说，他吹起喜庆的曲子，能让人人喜笑颜开；吹起哀愁的曲子，能让石人落泪。解放以后，他被调到县文化馆作农村文化鼓动工作。组织上专门培养他学文化，这会儿他更是多才多艺了。按社员的说法，他可以出口成章，即景编曲。他终日推着他那小车串乡走村，给社员们送去精神食粮，他成了农村广大社员爱戴的民间文艺战士。现在他来了，人们当然欢迎他啰！
    他放下小车，向大伙儿一招手：“同志们加油干，咱们大家比比看。人人都做新愚公，建设社会主义好家园。来！今年挖出万方土，明年多收一万担！”声音是这么洪亮悦耳。说着他夺过一辆推土车，冲进了人流。
    当老乐推车从我面前经过的时候，我看清了他的面容：一对浓眉，一双闪着智慧的光芒的大眼，脸上挂着和善、欢乐的笑容。他那副肩膀结实有力，推起这几百斤重的小车，健步如飞。
    休息的时候到了，人们立刻象潮水一样拥向老乐和他那辆小车，吵嚷着：
      “看看老乐给咱们带来了什么？”
    “让老乐给咱们讲一段！”
    “让老乐给咱们吹一曲！”
    老乐扬起头，大声说：
    “同志们，这一回专门给你们送来最好的礼物——《一心为革命》。”说着从车上拿起一本书，高高地举起来，“这就是雷锋式的战士王杰同志的日记，今天才到的。”话音没落，人们都挤了上来，不一会儿，车上的书就被拿光了。人们珍惜地抚摸着这本书的红彤彤的封面，注视着封面上王杰同志的英武的面容。
    有人请求说：
    “老乐同志，再给咱们讲讲王杰的事儿吧！”
      “对！”很多人应和着。
    老乐爽快地说：
    “好，我给大家拉拉！”
    老乐很会讲故事，他讲得通俗、清楚，很朴素，而且收到了惊人的效果。我看到：老人们在频频点头，妇女们在擦拭着激动的泪花，小伙子们涨红着脸，捏紧了拳头。
    他刚刚讲完的一刹那，人们没有一点动静，大家还沉浸在对王杰同志的怀念中，还沉浸在今后怎样对待生活的思考中。这时候，公社书记向大家说：“同志们，我们怎样向王杰同志学习呀？”
      “我们好好学习毛主席著作！”
      “我们提前拿下这个水库工程！”
      “我们要为建设社会主义新农村奋斗！”
    没人宣布休息时间已经完了，大家自动回到岗位上，拿起工具。这时，老乐又操起一辆推土车。公社书记走过来拦着说：
      “老乐，把车放下，拿出唢呐，给大家再鼓鼓劲吧！”
    “好！我来。”老乐应承着放下车子，从他那小车上拿出唢呐，站到高高的堤坝上，吹奏了起来。
    唢呐声象是一跃而下的瀑布，象是一泻千里的大川，象是鼓舞战士们冲锋的号角，它激励着人们向前！向前！工地上的人群加紧了脚步，加快了劳动节奏。那裂石挖土声，那有节奏的打夯声，那号子声，和着唢呐声组成壮丽的乐章。镐头闪着银光，大夯在跳跃，车轮在飞快的旋转，大地在颤动，千军万马在向大自然进攻。
