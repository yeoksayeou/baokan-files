    据新华社五日讯　近两年来，全国工业交通战线掀起了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作热潮，开展了社会主义教育运动，大学解放军，大学大庆，开展比学赶帮超群众运动，涌现出了一批先进单位。这批先进单位，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中起了带头作用和示范作用。
    最近召开的全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议，根据各省市自治区和中央工业交通各部提名，推荐出七十个大庆式先进单位，它们是全国各地区、各行业先进单位的代表，是全国工业交通企业的学习榜样。
    这一批大庆式先进单位当中，有全国闻名的大庆油田，有一九六三年受到国家经委表扬的五个勤俭办企业的先进单位：襄樊棉织厂、潞安矿务局石圪节煤矿、兰州炼油厂、湖南橡胶厂、上海嘉丰棉纺织厂；有中央工业交通各部所属的企业，也有各省、市、自治区所属的企业；有冶金、化工、煤炭、石油、电力、建筑材料、林业、机械、农业机械等部门的重工业企业，也有纺织、轻工、手工业部门的企业，以及铁道、交通、邮电、地质和物资部门的企业；有工业交通企业，也有新兴的工业地区。
    这七十个大庆式先进单位的共同特点是，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，坚持以政治统帅生产、统帅技术、统帅业务，坚持群众路线，不断地进行技术革新和技术革命，出色地完成了生产建设任务，培养出了一支革命化的工人阶级队伍，并且开始取得了按照毛泽东思想办企业的经验。全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议认为，推广他们的经验，将会进一步促进工业交通战线上学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超群众运动的继续深入发展，进一步促进企业革命化，促进工业生产新高潮。
