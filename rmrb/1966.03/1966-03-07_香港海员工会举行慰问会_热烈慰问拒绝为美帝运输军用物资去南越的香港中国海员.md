    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th - According to Hong Kong newspapers, the Hong Kong Seamen's Union held a solidarity meeting on the evening of the 2nd, warmly comforting the Hong Kong Chinese seamen who refused to transport military supplies to South Vietnam for U.S. imperialism.
    Wu Liguang, chairman of the Hong Kong Seamen's Union, warmly praised the fighting spirit of these seamen against U.S. imperialism at the meeting. He said that now, more and more seamen in Hong Kong are using the action of refusing to go to South Vietnam to strike at the American aggressors.
    The seamen who refused to go to South Vietnam exchanged their struggle experiences at the solidarity meeting. They encouraged each other and expressed that they must strengthen unity and carry this struggle against U.S. imperialism through to the end. At the meeting, letters of solidarity from compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong were read, and donations of solidarity money from compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong were presented to them. Many seamen handed over the solidarity money to the union to be given to class brothers who were living in even more difficult circumstances.
    Since Hong Kong Chinese seamen have been refusing to transport supplies to Vietnam for U.S. imperialism, the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* have received many letters from workers, students, and overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon, severely condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people and warmly praising the just actions of the Hong Kong Chinese seamen.
    Recently, two more groups of Hong Kong Chinese seamen forced two freighters transporting military supplies to South Vietnam for U.S. imperialism to change their routes and return to Hong Kong on February 14 and February 26, respectively. These two freighters were the "Phoenix" flying the Panamanian flag and the "Meijianmei" flying the Norwegian flag.

    香港海员工会举行慰问会
    热烈慰问拒绝为美帝运输军用物资去南越的香港中国海员
    新华社香港五日电　据香港报纸报道，香港海员工会二日晚举行慰问会，热烈慰问拒绝为美帝国主义运输军用物资去南越的香港中国海员。
    香港海员工会主席吴理广在会上热烈赞扬了这些海员反对美帝国主义的斗争精神。他说，现在香港正有越来越多的海员以拒绝去南越的行动来打击美国侵略者。
    拒绝去南越的海员们在慰问会上交流斗争的经验，他们互相勉励，并且表示一定要加强团结，把这一反对美帝国主义的斗争坚持到底。会上还宣读了香港各界同胞给他们的慰问信，向他们赠送了香港各界同胞捐助的慰问金。不少海员把慰问金交给工会转给生活更为困难的阶级兄弟。
    自香港中国海员纷纷拒绝为美帝国主义运输侵越物资后，香港《文汇报》和《大公报》收到了港九各业工人、学生和海外华侨写来的许多信件，这些信件严厉谴责美帝国主义对越南人民的侵略罪行，热情称赞香港中国海员的正义行动。
    最近又有两批香港中国海员迫使两艘为美帝国主义运输军用物资去南越的货轮改变航线，分别于二月十四日和二月二十六日返抵香港。这两艘货轮是悬挂巴拿马旗的“凤凰号”和悬挂挪威旗的“美健美号”。
