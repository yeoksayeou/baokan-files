    I Will Dedicate My Life to Revolution Here
    Using Jiao Yulu's deeds as a mirror, learning through three self-criticism sessions with the spirit of rectification, recognizing the need to view the objective conditions of this county with a dialectical approach, identifying the reasons for the county committee's unsatisfactory performance, and resolving to dedicate myself to working in the minority areas for life.
    Qiu Yulang, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Committee of Sandu Shui Autonomous County, Guizhou

    After our county committee leading cadres initially examined our thoughts and work by comparing ourselves to Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary deeds, I further carried out self-revolution in the spirit of rectification, studying the *People's Daily* reports sentence by sentence. Each time I studied and examined myself, my understanding deepened, and I dug deeper into the roots of my thinking.

    The first time I studied Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, especially the passage where he said after returning to the county committee the day after arriving in Lankao, "Lankao is a place with great potential; the key is to work and make revolution. Lankao is a disaster area, poor, with many difficulties, but disaster areas have an advantage: they can temper people's revolutionary will and cultivate their revolutionary character. Revolutionaries must be heroes in the face of difficulties." This passage greatly inspired me. However, I have been in Sandu for six years, but I lack a dialectical understanding of Sandu's objective conditions. In my eyes, Sandu has: first, large mountains, inconvenient transportation, scattered residences, and strenuous work; second, many Shui people and other ethnic minorities, whose languages I don't understand; third, backward production habits and extensive cultivation. In short, there are many difficult conditions and few favorable conditions, making it difficult to improve work. Comparing myself with the above passage of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I also studied relevant articles by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said in his article "Serve the People": "When our comrades are in difficulty, we must see achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." In his article "On the Chongqing Negotiations," he said, "Things in the world are complex and determined by various factors. We must look at problems from all sides, not just from one side." This is how Comrade Jiao Yulu looked at problems. I deeply realized that compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have not put enough effort into studying Chairman Mao's works, especially in the "application" aspect.

    After this study, I now have a new understanding of Sandu's objective conditions: first, the large mountains are rich in resources, with hundreds of kinds of Chinese medicinal materials and a large amount of timber, and a large amount of barren mountains can be planted with trees; there are many aquatic plants in the mountains, which are very conducive to accumulating fertilizer and developing animal husbandry, and there are dozens of kinds of mineral deposits, with inexhaustible wealth; second, the Shui people and other ethnic minorities have the characteristics of diligence, thrift, and the courage to fight against difficulties. These are the most active and positive factors in changing Sandu's backwardness. As long as we rely closely on the masses, no matter how great the difficulties, they can be overcome. Third, backward farming habits can be changed by educating the masses, and there is great potential for increasing grain production. In addition, Sandu is located in the subtropical zone, with abundant rainfall, suitable for planting various crops. With such good conditions, the work can certainly be done well.

    Sandu has such good objective conditions, so why isn't the work done well? With this question in mind, I restudied Jiao Yulu. Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "We have deep feelings for every grass and tree in Lankao. Faced with serious natural disasters, we have revolutionary courage to resolutely lead the people of the whole county, fight hard for several years, and change the face of Lankao. We will not rest in peace until we achieve our goals." Comparing myself with this passage, although I have feelings for the mountains of Sandu, for the fraternal ethnic groups of Sandu, and for every grass and tree of Sandu, they are not deep; under difficult and backward conditions, I lack the revolutionary courage to lead the people of the whole county to fight hard for several years to change the face of Sandu; I do not have the determination to not rest in peace until I achieve my goals. I have a concept in my mind: areas like Sandu can only move slowly, not quickly; as long as we can increase production a little bit every year, that's good enough. I lack the spirit of "revolutionaries must be heroes in the face of difficulties"; I lack the revolutionary spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, I lack the ambition to overcome difficulties, transform nature, and build Sandu into a new socialist Sandu in a not-too-long period of time; in a word, I lack Comrade Jiao Yulu's idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly. The reason is: I have no long-term plan to work in Sandu for life.

    Why don't I have a long-term plan to work in Sandu for life? With this question in mind, I studied Jiao Yulu for the third time. When I read the passage about Jiao Yulu having all the Party members and all the people in his heart, but not himself, I was extremely moved. Comrade Jiao Yulu's noble qualities of not seeking fame or profit, being wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and serving the people wholeheartedly, powerfully spurred me on. Comparing myself to Comrade Jiao Yulu's great image, I dug deep into my thinking and found that in the deepest part of my thinking, there is still an "I". Serving the people and treating revolutionary work, I mixed personal thoughts, and lacked deep feelings for Sandu. How can I do the work well? Thinking of this, I couldn't help but be startled. In the past, I always thought that after more than ten years of cultivation and education by the Party, my non-proletarian thoughts had been transformed almost completely. Now, comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu's noble qualities of serving the people completely and thoroughly, I feel that I am still far from it!

    Why does an "I" still exist in my thinking? The most fundamental reason is that I have not earnestly armed my mind with Mao Zedong Thought. Although I have studied some of Chairman Mao's works in the past ten years, I have not put enough effort into the "application" aspect, especially in using Mao Zedong Thought to transform my subjective world. In his article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao taught us to be extremely responsible for our work and extremely enthusiastic towards our comrades and the people; in "On the Chongqing Negotiations," he also taught us: to bear hardship first and enjoy comfort later, and to choose the heavy burdens to carry in our work. Although I have studied Chairman Mao's teachings many times and often used them to educate comrades, I have used them poorly myself. This is a concrete manifestation of my failure to transform my subjective world effectively.

    After studying Jiao Yulu three times, I realized that to change Sandu's backward and impoverished face, we must first transform the ideological face of the combat headquarters – the county committee members. Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "With cadres who can resist disasters, there will be masses who can resist disasters." This is absolutely correct. In the future, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works as Jiao Yulu did, especially work hard to transform our subjective world, and realize the revolutionization of the county committee leadership. We are determined to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the people of all ethnic groups in the county, and fight hard for three to five years to completely change the backward and impoverished face of Sandu.

    就在这里干一辈子革命
    以焦裕禄的事迹作镜子，用整风精神三次对照学习，认识到应该一分为二看待本县的客观条件，检查出县委工作不出色的原因，自己决心在少数民族地区干一辈子
    贵州三都水族自治县县委副书记　邱玉郎
    在我们县委领导干部对照焦裕禄同志的革命事迹，初步检查了思想和工作之后，我又用整风的精神进行自我革命，逐段逐句学习《人民日报》的报道。每对照学习检查一次，认识就提高一步，思想根子挖的也更深一层。
    第一遍学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，特别是他到了兰考以后的第二天，下去转了一圈回到县委后说的那段话，对我的启发很大。焦裕禄同志说：“兰考是个大有作为的地方，问题是要干，要革命。兰考是灾区，穷，困难多，但灾区有个好处，它能锻炼人的革命意志，培养人的革命品格。革命者要在困难面前逞英雄。”可是，我到三都六年了，但对三都的客观条件缺乏一分为二的认识。我眼里的三都：一是山大，交通不便，居住分散，工作费力；二是水族和其他少数民族多，语言不懂；三是生产习惯落后，耕作粗放。总之，困难条件多，有利条件少，工作难搞上去。对照着焦裕禄同志上面的一段话，我又学习了毛主席的有关文章。毛主席在《为人民服务》这篇文章里说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”。在《关于重庆谈判》这篇文章里又说：“世界上的事情是复杂的，是由各方面的因素决定的。看问题要从各方面去看，不能只从单方面看”。焦裕禄同志就是这样看问题的。我深深认识到：对比焦裕禄同志，我学习毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫是不够的。
    经过这样学习，现在，我对三都的客观条件有了新的认识：一是山大宝多，全县的山有几百种中药材和大量的木材，大量的荒山可以栽树；山里水草多，十分有利于积肥和发展畜牧业，还蕴藏着几十种矿藏，有取之不尽的财富；二是水族和其他少数民族人民，具有勤劳、俭朴的特点和敢于同困难斗争的勇气，这是改变三都落后面貌最活跃的最积极的因素，只要紧紧依靠群众，不管困难多大，都是可以克服的。三是耕作习惯落后，只要教育群众加以改变，增产粮食是大有潜力的。加之，三都地处亚热带，雨量充足，适宜种植各种农作物。有了这样的好条件，工作一定能够搞好。
    三都有这样好的客观条件，为什么工作搞得不出色呢？带着这个问题，我重学了焦裕禄。焦裕禄同志说：“我们对兰考的一草一木都有深厚的感情。面对着严重的自然灾害，我们有革命的胆略，坚决领导全县人民，苦战几年，改变兰考的面貌。不达目的，我们死不瞑目。”对照这一段话检查，我对三都的山、对三都的兄弟民族，对三都的一草一木，虽有感情，但不深厚；在困难落后的条件下，缺乏领导全县各族人民苦战几年，改变三都面貌的革命胆略；没有不达目的，死不瞑目的决心。头脑中有个概念：三都这样的地区，只能慢慢来，不能快步走；只要每年能够增点产，就算不错了。缺乏“革命者要在困难面前逞英雄”的气概；缺乏愚公移山的革命干劲，缺乏战胜困难，改造自然，在不太长的时间内把三都建设成为社会主义新三都的雄心壮志；一句话，缺乏焦裕禄同志那样完全、彻底为人民服务的思想。原因是：我没有在三都工作一辈子的长期打算。
    为什么没有在三都工作一辈子的长期打算呢？带着这个问题，我又第三遍学习了焦裕禄。当读到焦裕禄的心里装着全体党员和全体人民，唯独没有他自己这段文章的时候，极为感动。焦裕禄同志那种不为名、不为利，一心为革命，一心为人民，全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，有力地鞭策着我。对照着焦裕禄同志的高大形象，深挖了一下思想，发现在自己思想的最深处，还有一个“我”字。为人民服务，对待革命工作，掺杂着个人杂念，对三都缺乏深厚的感情，这怎么能把工作做好呢？想到这里，我不由吃了一惊，过去总以为在党十几年的培养教育下，自己的非无产阶级思想已经改造得差不多了。现在对照着焦裕禄同志完全、彻底为人民服务的高贵品质，觉得还差得远哩！
    为什么在思想上还存在着一个“我”字呢？最根本的是没有认真用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。十几年来，我虽然也学了一些毛主席著作，但在
  “用”字上下功夫不够，特别是在用毛泽东思想改造主观世界方面不够。毛主席在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里，教导我们对工作要极端的负责任，对同志对人民要极端的热忱；在《关于重庆谈判》中又教导我们：要吃苦在先，享受在后，工作要拣重担子挑。对于毛主席的这些教导，我虽然学了很多次，也经常拿来教育同志，但自己用得很差，这是改造自己主观世界不力的具体表现。
    经过三学焦裕禄，我认识到：要改变三都的落后贫困面貌，首先必须改造战斗司令部——县委成员的思想面貌。焦裕禄同志说：“有了抗灾的干部，才有抗灾的群众”。这话一点不错。今后，我们要象焦裕禄同志一样活学活用毛主席著作，特别是在改造主观世界上狠下功夫，实现县委领导革命化。我们决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，依靠全县各族人民，奋战三五年，彻底改变三都的落后贫困面貌。
