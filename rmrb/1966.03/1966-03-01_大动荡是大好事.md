    Great Upheaval is a Great Thing
    Xiang Donghui
    “The four seas are churning, clouds and waters raging, the five continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring.” Looking around the world, everywhere is surging with waves and filled with the flames of war. Even in those places that seem peaceful and quiet, the fiery underground magma may erupt overnight. Great upheaval is an important characteristic of the current international situation.
    Human history is full of thrilling struggles and earth-shaking changes. Different classes hold different views and adopt different attitudes towards this phenomenon.
    All reactionary ruling classes want to maintain their cannibalistic feasts forever and consolidate their extravagant and licentious “dynasties,” so they all curse upheaval and fear upheaval. There are no exceptions to this, whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad.
    At the end of the eighteenth century, the revolutionary masses of Paris stormed the Bastille and sent Louis XVI to the guillotine. How did reactionary historians record this magnificent revolutionary event?
    They wrote: This was a "mad world." They cursed the revolutionary people as "world monsters spewing out raging flames" and "birds of death cremating the world."
    Today, the capitalist system is utterly decadent. However, bourgeois "theoreticians" are still racking their brains to prove that this social system is "eternal." Old and modern revisionists, although they also mention "revolution" in words, are doing their best to promote the idea that capitalism can "peacefully grow into socialism" smoothly and easily.
    In the eyes of revolutionaries, great upheaval is inevitable. Great upheaval is not a bad thing, but a good thing. Without great upheaval, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Great winds and waves are not to be feared. Human society has developed from great winds and waves."
    Marxists believe that "there is nothing that does not include contradictions; without contradiction, there would be no world." ("On Contradiction") The opposing aspects of contradiction are both united and struggling. The unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, and transitional, and therefore relative; the struggle of opposites is absolute. In class society, since there are exploiters and the exploited, and groups with different interests, how can they live in peace and not have conflicts? Especially at the time of the transition between old and new social systems, the world situation is bound to undergo great upheaval. It is precisely because of the constant occurrence of upheaval and constant changes that human history continues to move forward.
    The ancient Roman Empire was mighty and awe-inspiring. Its capital was called the "Eternal City," meaning it would bring eternal peace to the empire. However, the slave owners' wishes did not become reality. Slave uprisings rose one after another, foreign invasions continued, and internal killings within the ruling group lasted for hundreds of years. Finally, on a dark night with lightning and thunder, angry slaves broke through the iron gates of the "Eternal City." The rule of the slave owners completely collapsed in this dramatic change and conflict.
    Wasn't the collapse of the feudal system and the rise of the capitalist system the same? In Europe, from the mid-seventeenth century onwards, there were nearly two hundred years of intense upheaval. During this period, dozens of crowns fell into the streets, and countless regimes changed hands repeatedly. Through attacks and counterattacks, victories and defeats, and the struggles of several generations, the bourgeoisie finally established its rule.
    Our era is the era of capitalism heading towards extinction and socialism heading towards victory. In the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: "The current world situation is a situation of the final struggle between the two major forces of revolution and counter-revolution." A great struggle is taking place between the revolutionary forces of the world and the counter-revolutionary forces, especially between the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys. The sharpness and intensity of the international class struggle exceeds any previous period. The history of the world has entered an era of unprecedented and dramatic upheaval.
    The great upheaval in the current international situation reflects the surging advance of the revolutionary torrent of the world's people, especially the vigorous rise of the revolutionary storms of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Before us is displayed a picture with bold strokes: hundreds of millions of people have plunged into the torrent of struggle. The flames of revolution burn now in this region, now in that region. The land under the feet of imperialism is collapsing in large swaths. Of course, the enemy will never be reconciled to its defeat. Imperialism and reactionaries always use the most brutal means to suppress the revolutionary movements of various countries, and when the people's struggle achieves victory, they still carry out counterattacks, trying in every possible way to restore their reactionary rule. Therefore, the victory and frustration of the struggle, the advance and retreat of the movement, are often intertwined. In some cases, the counterattacks of imperialism and reactionaries may succeed temporarily. However, this will only further raise the awareness of the people, further mobilize the people, and thus make the revolutionary movement develop more deeply and more widely. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that although there are twists and turns in the road ahead, the revolutionary movement of the oppressed people and oppressed nations is still like ten thousand horses galloping, and no force can stop or contain it.
    Like any reactionary force in history, U.S. imperialism is deeply disturbed by the current great upheaval in the international situation. A few months ago, Johnson muttered that he hoped the world would not "change or undergo transformation" in "ten years' time." U.S. imperialism is determined to maintain the status quo, that is, to maintain its status of enslaving the oppressed people and oppressed nations. However, it engages in aggression and creates chaos everywhere, which can only arouse more intense resistance from the people of various countries, thereby exacerbating the upheaval in the international situation. The objective law of historical development is diametrically opposed to the subjective wishes of the likes of Johnson.
    Since Marxists regard great upheaval as the inevitable result of the sharpening of international class struggle, they dare to face the current stormy seas and fly in the storm like a petrel. The task of revolutionaries is to promote the transformation of things according to the dialectic of things themselves, and to push the wheel of history forward faster!

    大动荡是大好事
    向东辉
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”环顾宇内，到处是波涛汹涌，烽火连天。即使在那些看来似乎是宁静安谧的地方，炽热的地下岩浆，也可能在一夜之间迸发出来。大动荡，是当前国际形势的一个重要特点。
    在人类的历史上，充满着惊心动魄的斗争和翻天覆地的变化。对于这种现象，不同的阶级，持有不同的看法，采取不同的态度。
    一切反动的统治阶级，都想永远维持他们的吃人的宴席，巩固他们的骄奢淫逸的“王朝”，因此他们都诅咒动荡，害怕动荡。这在古今中外，无一例外。
    十八世纪末叶，巴黎革命群众攻破了巴士底狱，把路易十六推上了断头台。反动的历史学家是怎样记载这一轰轰烈烈的革命史迹的呢？
    他们写道：这是一个“疯狂世界”。他们咒骂革命人民是“喷出熊熊烈火的世界怪兽”，是“火葬世界的死亡之鸟”。
    今天，资本主义制度已经腐朽透顶了，可是，资产阶级的“理论家”还在绞尽脑汁，力图证明这个社会制度是“永恒的”。老牌的和现代的修正主义者，虽然口头上也叨念着“革命”，可是他们竭力宣传资本主义可以平平稳稳、顺顺当当地“和平长入社会主义”。
    在革命者看来，大动荡是不可避免的。大动荡不是坏事，而是好事。没有大动荡，就不可能完成社会发展的飞跃。毛泽东同志曾经这样说过：“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”
    马克思主义者认为，“没有什么事物不包括矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”（《矛盾论》）矛盾着的对立面，又统一，又斗争。对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、过渡的，因而是相对的；对立的斗争则是绝对的。在阶级社会中，既然存在着剥削者和被剥削者，存在着利害不同的集团，它们之间怎么能够相安无事，怎么能够不发生冲突呢？特别是在新旧社会制度交替之际，世界局势必然要发生大动荡。正是由于不断地出现动荡，不断地发生变革，人类的历史才不断地向前推进。
    古代的罗马帝国威震四方，喧赫一时。它的首都，被称为“永恒城”，意味它将给帝国带来永恒的安宁。但是，奴隶主的祝愿，并没有成为现实。此起彼伏的奴隶起义，连绵不断的外族入侵，以及统治集团的内部残杀，延续几百年。终于，在一个闪电交加、雷声隆隆的黑夜里，愤怒的奴隶攻破了“永恒城”的铁门。奴隶主的统治，就在这种急剧的变化和冲突中彻底崩溃了。
    封建制度的崩溃，资本主义制度的兴起，又何尝不是如此呢？在欧洲，从十七世纪中叶起，经历了将近二百年的激烈动荡。在这段时期内，成打的王冠滚落街头，无数的政权反复更迭。进攻和反扑，胜利和失败，经历了几代的斗争，资产阶级才确立了自己的统治。
    我们的时代，是资本主义走向灭亡，社会主义走向胜利的时代。用毛泽东同志的话来说：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面”。全世界革命势力同反革命势力之间，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗之间，正在进行一场大搏斗。国际阶级斗争的尖锐和剧烈，超过过去任何一个时期。世界的历史，进入了空前剧烈的大动荡的时代。
    当前国际形势的大动荡，反映了世界人民革命巨流的奔腾前进，特别是反映了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命风暴的猛烈兴起。在我们的面前，展示出一幅笔调粗犷的图画：数以亿万计的人民群众，投入了斗争的洪流。革命的烈火，时而在这个地区，时而在那个地区燃烧起来。帝国主义脚下的土地，正在大片大片地崩塌。当然，敌人是决不会甘心于自己的失败的。帝国主义和反动派总是采取最残暴的手段来镇压各国人民的革命运动，而当人民斗争取得胜利之后，它们仍然要进行反扑，千方百计地力图恢复它们的反动统治。因而，斗争的胜利和挫折，运动的前进和后退，常常交织在一起。在某些情况下，帝国主义和反动派的反扑也会一时得逞。但是，这只会进一步提高人民的觉悟，进一步把人民动员起来，从而使革命运动更加深入、更加广泛地向前发展。事实已经证明并将继续证明，尽管前进的道路有曲折，被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命运动仍然有如万马奔腾，没有任何力量能够加以阻挡和遏制。
    同历史上的任何反动势力一样，美帝国主义对于当前的国际局势大动荡，深感不安。几个月前，约翰逊嗫嗫嚅嚅地说：他期望世界在“十年的时间里”，不要“发生变化或遭到变革”。美帝国主义一心想维持现状，即维持它奴役被压迫人民和被压迫民族的现状。但是，它到处进行侵略，到处制造乱子，结果只能是激起各国人民更为强烈的反抗，从而，加剧了国际局势的动荡。历史发展的客观规律，同约翰逊之流的主观愿望，正好是背道而驰。
    马克思主义者既然把大动荡看作是国际阶级斗争尖锐化的必然结果，因而敢于面对当前的惊涛骇浪，象海燕那样，在暴风雨中飞翔。革命者的任务，就是要根据事物本身的辩证法，促成事物的转化，使历史的车轮更快地向前推进！
