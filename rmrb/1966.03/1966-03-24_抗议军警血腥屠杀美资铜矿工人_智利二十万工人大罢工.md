    According to Xinhua News Agency, Santiago: Two hundred thousand Chilean workers held a general strike on the 15th to protest the bloody massacre of workers at the American-owned Salvador copper mine by the Chilean army and police on the 11th, and to demand a resolution to the strike of workers at the American-owned Teniente copper mine.

    A mass rally was also held in Santiago, the capital of Chile, at the Artesanos Plaza. Participating in the rally were tens of thousands of workers from the capital and a delegation of nearly two thousand workers from the Teniente copper mine. Speakers at the rally strongly condemned the crime of massacring miners and opposed the authorities' policy of suppressing the striking miners to comply with the demands of American imperialism.

    The Chilean Chamber of Deputies has passed a resolution to organize a commission of inquiry to investigate the bloody incident that occurred at the Salvador copper mine.

    It is reported that on the afternoon of the 11th, Chilean army and police forces brazenly opened fire to suppress the striking miners who were persisting in their strike in the American-owned Salvador copper mine area. Seven workers were killed and thirty-eight workers were injured.

    People from all walks of life in Chile strongly condemned the brutal massacre of miners by the military and police.
