    How can we complete this year's production increase plan? Comrade An Shurun, deputy instructor of the nitric acid workshop at the Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, initially didn't emphasize politics and just calculated mathematical accounts alone, but no matter how he calculated, he couldn't complete the plan. Later, he emphasized politics, comprehensively studied various conditions, and especially included the human factor, the enormous power that can be generated by creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and his confidence increased; he mobilized the masses to come up with many measures, and the enthusiasm grew even greater.
    A short commentary published by the *Shanxi Daily* said that Comrade Mao Zedong said, "We must advocate that every Red Army commander become a brave and wise hero." Engaging in production is the same as fighting a war. Now that we are carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the cadres who lead this movement must also be brave and wise. Brave means daring to shoulder heavy burdens, daring to climb peaks, daring to strategically despise difficulties, and having the courage to overcome everything; without this courage, it is impossible to organize a movement to increase production and practice economy. Wise means being good at understanding all aspects of the subjective and objective situation, being good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses, being good at tactically paying attention to difficulties, and having the strategy to control the entire movement; without this strategy, it is also impossible to lead the movement to increase production and practice economy well.
    Bravery and wisdom are two aspects of the same thing and must be closely combined. The process of combining the two is a process of mutual promotion. In this process, the fundamental driving force for driving people forward is politics, is Mao Zedong Thought. Emphasizing politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to improve people's awareness leads to the courage to struggle; with courage, daring to think and daring to act, we can come up with methods, achieve results, cultivate talents, and discover laws; as people's understanding of objective laws continues to deepen, the courage to struggle will become increasingly high.

    当勇敢明智的领导者
    怎样完成今年的增产计划？太原化肥厂硝酸车间副指导员安树润同志，开始没有突出政治，只是一个人在那里算数学账，左算右算完不成。后来，他突出政治，全面研究各方面的条件，特别是把人的因素，把活学活用毛主席著作可以产生巨大威力等因素估计在内，信心提高了；发动群众想出许多措施，劲头就更大了。
    《山西日报》发表短评说，毛泽东同志说过，“我们必须提倡每个红军指挥员变为勇敢而明智的英雄”。搞生产和打仗一样。我们现在开展增产节约运动，领导这个运动的干部也必须勇敢而明智。勇敢，就是要敢于挑重担，敢于攀高峰，敢于在战略上藐视困难，有压倒一切的勇气；没有这种勇气，是不可能组织起增产节约运动来的。明智，就是要善于把主客观各方面的情况都弄清楚，善于把群众的智慧集中起来，善于在战术上重视困难，有驾驭整个运动的谋略；没有这种谋略，也不可能把增产节约运动领导好。
    勇敢和明智，是一个事情的两个方面，必须紧密地结合起来。两者结合的过程，是互相促进的过程。在这个过程中，带动人们前进的根本动力是政治，是毛泽东思想。突出政治，用毛泽东思想提高了人的觉悟，才有敢于斗争的勇气；有了勇气，敢想敢干，才能想出办法，干出成绩，炼出才干，摸出规律；随着人们对于客观规律的认识不断加深，斗争的勇气也就越来越高。
