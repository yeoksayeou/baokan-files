    History and Reality
    Sima Da
    Why is the United States waging a war in South Vietnam, 8,000 miles away from its homeland? How much is at stake for the United States in this war? Why is the United States staying in South Vietnam at any cost? The magazine *U.S. News & World Report*, published at the end of February, raised these questions in an article.

    To defend the Johnson administration's policy of persisting in its aggression against Vietnam and intensifying the war, the magazine made a historical review of the United States' Asian policy, attempting to use historical arguments to refute the claims of those in the United States who oppose further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    What historical arguments did *U.S. News & World Report* put forward? First, it believes that the United States' "involvement" in Asia did not begin today. In the more than 100 years since the founding of the United States, it has already fought five formal wars in Asia. These include the Spanish-American War of 1898, the war to suppress the Philippine uprising from 1899 to 1902, the Pacific War from 1941 to 1945, the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, and the South Vietnam War, which began in 1961 and has not yet stopped. Therefore, there is precedent for the United States to fight in Asia, and "South Vietnam is just the latest page in the two-century history of the United States (in Asia)." Next, the magazine pointed out that all these wars were fought for "American interests" and "security." The United States paid the price of more than 400,000 casualties in these five wars, with the aim of "planting the American flag on the Pacific and preventing others from pulling it down." Therefore, in its view, since the United States pursued a policy of "isolationism" towards Europe before the First World War, it "became involved in Asian affairs" for its own "interests." Now that it has become an Asian "power" with greater "interests" and "responsibilities," how can it withdraw? Since the United States' current Asian policy has "no substantial difference" from its previous policies, what can be criticized about what the Johnson administration is doing in South Vietnam?

    This mouthpiece of Washington probably thought that with such historical arguments, it could prove the necessity of the United States persisting in occupying South Vietnam and help extricate the beleaguered Johnson administration. However, in the eyes of discerning people, the result is just the opposite. This argument not only amounts to a confession of the consistent aggression of American imperialism against Asia, but also exposes the lies that the U.S. government has always professed, such as that the United States is staying in South Vietnam and Asia to "resist aggression," "defend independence," and "maintain freedom." Johnson, Rusk, McNamara, and the like have been using these lies as a talisman for their aggression against Vietnam and Asia.

    Of course, *U.S. News & World Report* had to admit that the wars waged by the United States in Asia were for America's own vital interests, because it could not hide the facts of history.

    As everyone knows, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was an imperialist war launched by American imperialism to re-divide the world's colonies. The result of this war was the seizure of Cuba, the Philippines, and Guam from the old Spanish colonialists. For American imperialism, whose industrial output had just surpassed that of Britain to rank first in the world, and which had already shown a desire for foreign expansion, "this was just a small appetizer to stimulate the appetite for a rich meal" (Lenin). The war to suppress the Philippine uprising from 1899 to 1902, with its obvious colonial nature and the bloody crime of massacring 600,000 Filipinos, made the American writer Mark Twain feel ashamed and advocate changing the American flag to a pirate flag, "with the white stripes dyed black, and the stars replaced by skulls and crossbones." Although the Pacific War from 1941 to 1945 was part of the Second World War against German, Japanese and Italian fascism, everyone is clear that the purpose of the United States' participation in this war was not so much to "defend" Asia and oppose Japanese imperialist aggression, but rather to replace Japanese imperialism and extend the United States' power from the Pacific to the Asian continent. It was after this war that American generals and politicians gleefully called the Pacific the "American lake." As for the wars of aggression against Korea and Vietnam, the purpose of American imperialism is even more obvious and well-established. *U.S. News & World Report*'s call for people to revisit this bloody history of American policy toward Asia can only make the people of Asian countries more clearly recognize that American imperialism is a common enemy that has consistently engaged in aggression against them.

    What is ridiculous is that these apologists for the Johnson administration think they are familiar with history, but in fact they are showing their ignorance of history. Because they only see the continuity and "no difference" in the United States' policy of aggression against Asia, they completely fail to see the fact that the history of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. Today's Asia is neither the Asia of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where American gunboats could run rampant, nor the Asia of the early post-World War II period, where American imperialism could invade and expand as it pleased. From the Korean Peninsula to the jungles of Indochina, from the shores of the Pacific to the shores of the Indian Ocean, thunder rumbles and smoke billows everywhere. Where is there still a paradise for American imperialism? If American imperialism conquered the entire Philippine archipelago with only 70,000 invading troops at the beginning of this century, now it cannot even deal with half of Vietnam's people even if it deploys hundreds of thousands of troops. In 1931, the American magazine *Fortune* wrote triumphantly: "The power of Standard Oil of New York in China seems to be greater than the power of the Chinese government," but today Washington has to exclaim that China has become "the most serious and troublesome problem facing the United States." Asia, the continent that American imperialism once regarded as a stepping stone to usurp world hegemony, is today becoming the burial ground for American imperialist aggressors, and hundreds of millions of Asian people are its gravediggers. The history of Asia has changed, the people of Asia have stood up, but the lords in Washington are still dreaming the dreams of conquerors of half a century or even a century ago. How can they not be battered and bruised?

    Johnson and his ilk are still shouting hoarsely that the United States will never "withdraw from South Vietnam," never "withdraw from Asia," and never "return to Waikiki" (Waikiki is a summer resort in Hawaii, used here as a metaphor for the United States retreating from Asia to Hawaii). But as an inevitable result of historical development, it is inevitable that American aggressors will roll back from all parts of Asia, and this retreat has already begun after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution in the late 1940s. *U.S. News & World Report* tries to prove that the United States must "get involved in Asia" and "hold on to Asia" in order to defend Johnson, but those who have deeply felt the consequences of "getting involved in Asia" understand what this "involvement" policy means for the United States. General MacArthur, who was praised by Johnson's predecessor Truman as having "unparalleled military strategy in history," tasted the iron fists of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield, and before his death, he instructed, "Any president who puts American troops into a land war in Asia needs to have his head examined." For Johnson, who is repeating Truman's mistakes in Korea today in South Vietnam, is MacArthur's experience as a loser at the hands of the Asian people not more powerful than *U.S. News & World Report*'s historical arguments?

    历史和现实
    司马达
    美国为什么要到远离本土八千英里的南越去进行一场战争？这场战争对于美国究竟有多大的利害关系？为什么美国要不惜任何代价呆在南越不走？二月底出版的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志，在一篇文章里提出了这样的问题。
    为了替约翰逊政府坚持侵略越南和加紧扩大战争的政策辩护，这家杂志特地对美国的亚洲政策作了一番历史的回顾，它力图用历史的论据来反驳美国国内那些反对进一步扩大侵越战争的人的主张。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志提出的历史论据是什么呢？首先，它认为，美国“卷入”亚洲并非自今日始。在美国立国以后的一百多年历史上，它已经在亚洲进行过五场正式的战争了。其中包括一八九八年的美国—西班牙战争，一八九九——一九○二年镇压菲律宾起义的战争，一九四一——一九四五年的太平洋战争，一九五○——一九五三年的朝鲜战争，和从一九六一年起到现在还未停止的南越战争。因此，美国在亚洲打仗是有先例可援的，“南越不过是近两个世纪以来美国（在亚洲）历史的最新的一页而已。”接着，这家杂志又指出，所有这些战争，都是为了“美国的利益”和“安全”而进行的。美国在这五次战争中付出伤亡四十多万人的代价，其目的就是“为了把美国国旗插在太平洋上，不让别人拔掉。”因此，在它看来，既然美国在第一次世界大战以前对欧洲奉行“孤立主义”政策时就为了自己的“利益”而“卷入亚洲事务”，现在当它已经成为亚洲的“强国”，拥有更大的“利益”和“责任”时，怎么反而能够撤出呢？既然美国现在的亚洲政策同它以前奉行的政策“毫无实质区别”，约翰逊政府在南越的所作所为又有什么可以指责的呢？
    这个华盛顿的喉舌大概以为，有了这样的历史论据，它就可以证明美国坚持霸占南越之必要，而替陷入四面楚歌的约翰逊政府解围了。但是，在明眼人看来，其结果倒是恰恰相反。这种论据不但等于是美帝国主义一贯侵略亚洲的自供状，而且拆穿了美国政府一贯表白的所谓美国呆在南越和亚洲是为了“抵抗侵略”、“保卫独立”、“维护自由”等等的鬼话。而约翰逊、腊斯克和麦克纳马拉之流是一直在用这些鬼话来作他们侵略越南和亚洲的护身符的。
    当然，《美国新闻与世界报道》所以不得不承认美国在亚洲进行的战争是为了美国的切身利益，这是因为它无法掩盖历史的事实。
    大家知道，一八九八年的美西战争，是美帝国主义为了重新瓜分世界殖民地而发动的帝国主义战争。这场战争的结果是从西班牙老殖民主义者手里夺取了古巴、菲律宾和关岛。对于当时工业生产量刚刚超过英国而居世界首位，而已经表现出对外扩张贪欲的美帝国主义来说，“这不过是为了丰富大餐而刺激胃口的小吃”（列宁语）而已。而一八九九——一九○二年镇压菲律宾起义的战争，其明显的殖民性质和屠杀六十万菲律宾人的血腥罪行，使美国作家马克·吐温也为之感到羞愧，而主张把美国的星条旗干脆改成海盗旗帜，“旗上的白条要染成黑的，而星星则应代之以骷髅头和两根交叉的骨头”。一九四一——一九四五年的太平洋战争尽管是反对德日意法西斯的第二次世界大战的一部分，但是谁都清楚，美国参加这次战争的目的，与其说是为了“保卫”亚洲，反对日本帝国主义侵略，毋宁说是为了取代日本帝国主义而把美国的势力从太平洋上伸张到亚洲大陆上来。正是在这场战争之后，美国的将军政客们得意忘形地把太平洋称作美国的“内湖”。至于侵略朝鲜和侵略越南的战争，美帝国主义的目的何在，这更是人所共见，早有定论了。《美国新闻与世界报道》要人们重温美国对亚洲政策的这一段血腥的历史，岂不是只能使亚洲各国人民更加认识清楚美帝国主义是对他们一贯进行侵略的共同敌人吗？
    可笑的是，这些约翰逊政府的辩护士自以为熟悉历史，实际上却正表现了对历史的无知。因为他们只看到美国侵略亚洲政策的一脉相承和“毫无区别”，而完全没有看到亚洲历史已经发生了根本变化的事实。今天的亚洲，既不是十九世纪末，二十世纪初美国炮舰可以横行无阻的亚洲，也不是第二次世界大战后初期美帝国主义可以为所欲为地侵略扩张的亚洲。从朝鲜半岛到印度支那丛林，从太平洋岸到印度洋畔，到处是雷声隆隆，烽烟滚滚，哪里还有美帝国主义的一片乐土？如果说本世纪之初美帝国主义只以区区七万侵略军队就征服了整个菲律宾群岛的话，那么现在它即使陈兵数十万之众也无法对付半个越南的人民了。一九三一年的美国《幸福》杂志曾经得意洋洋地写道：“纽约美孚石油公司在中国的权力似乎比中国政府的权力还要大些”，但是今天华盛顿却不得不惊呼中国已成为美国“所面临的最严重和最麻烦的问题”了。亚洲，这个曾经被美帝国主义当作僣取世界霸权垫脚石的大陆，今天正在成为美帝国主义侵略者的葬身之地，而亿万亚洲人民就是它的掘墓人。亚洲的历史变了，亚洲人民站起来了，华盛顿的老爷们却还在做着半个世纪甚至一个世纪以前的征服者的迷梦，他们那有不碰得头破血流之理呢？
    约翰逊之流今天还在声嘶力竭地叫嚷美国决不“撤出南越”，决不“撤出亚洲”，决不“回到威基基去”（威基基是夏威夷的一个避暑胜地，此处喻为美国从亚洲退守夏威夷）。但是作为历史发展的必然结果，美国侵略者从亚洲的一切地方滚回去却是不可避免的，而且这种撤退早已从四十年代之末中国人民革命胜利之后就开始了。《美国新闻与世界报道》为了替约翰逊辩护而力图证明美国必须“卷入亚洲”，“守住亚洲”，但是那些曾经对“卷入亚洲”的后果深有所感的人们，却懂得这种“卷入”政策对于美国究竟意味着什么。被约翰逊的前辈杜鲁门吹捧为具有“历史上罕见其匹的韬略”的麦克阿瑟将军，在朝鲜战场上饱尝了朝中人民铁拳的滋味之后，曾经在临终前嘱咐过“哪个总统要把美国军队投入亚洲陆地战争，就得把他的脑袋检查一下”。对于今天正在南越重蹈杜鲁门当年在朝鲜的覆辙的约翰逊来说，亚洲人民手下败将麦克阿瑟的这个经验之谈难道不比《美国新闻与世界报道》的历史论据更有力吗？（附图片）
