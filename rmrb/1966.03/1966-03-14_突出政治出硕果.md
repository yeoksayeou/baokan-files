    How can we emphasize politics in grassroots units and technically complex departments? How can we place political and ideological work above all other work, using politics to command technology and expertise? The "Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Writings," "Red Vanguard Company," and "Aviation Hero Squadron," all awarded titles by the Ministry of National Defense, have some excellent experiences in these areas. These units have consistently taken the path of emphasizing politics for many years, making good work even better, and have been continuously rated as "Four Good" companies for five years.
    Emphasizing Politics is the Foundation of Grassroots Construction
    How to build a company into a very proletarianized and very combat-ready unit? The experience of the "Red Vanguard Company" of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region is that the most important thing is to follow Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, and to adhere to the path of emphasizing politics.
      The "Red Vanguard Company" is the company where the internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao served before his death. It has a glorious history in the revolutionary war years. Since the launch of the "Four Good" company campaign in 1961, it has achieved new successes and become an advanced company known both inside and outside the military. In their long revolutionary struggle, they have formed this tradition: as soon as new soldiers arrive in the company, they receive political education. The first weapon given to them is Chairman Mao's writings, the first lesson they take is class education, and the first heroic figure they learn about is Luo Shengjiao. In peacetime, they unremittingly arm the minds of soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, making the political atmosphere of the company strong and raising morale high.
    In this company, whenever conflicts arise between politics and technology, they consciously emphasize politics. They say: Only when people establish the revolutionary ambition to have the whole world in view, and train with class hatred and a sense of the enemy's presence, can training results improve by leaps and bounds. Once, they went to the north to carry out a mission, which delayed their training for more than two months. After returning, the Party branch did not immediately focus on military training, but instead spent more than ten days organizing officers and soldiers to study our government's statement supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, review "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and read "Letters from the South." Through study, the class hatred of all the soldiers was aroused, and a wave of hard training to master the skills of killing the enemy was quickly set off. A few months later, they not only made up for the training subjects delayed by the two months away but also achieved new successes.
    When time is tight and tasks are heavy, the relationship between politics and technology can easily be unbalanced, but this company has always handled it well. They say: The more work there is and the heavier the burden, the more important it is to put political and ideological work first. In May last year, the higher authorities decided to hold a swimming demonstration meeting in their company, and comrades from fraternal units also came to visit. At that time, the preparation time was short, and they not only had to practice the movements well but also had to summarize the experience of swimming training over the years. Faced with this situation, the Party branch proposed to emphasize politics even more, adhere to the "Four Firsts," and not "change direction." They continued to insist on daily talks, celebrate Party Day, and mobilize everyone to do political and ideological work. All the officers and soldiers in the company carried Chairman Mao's quotations, studied before going into the water, and studied again after swimming, launching a competition to refine thought, refine style, and refine technology. Their enthusiasm grew higher and higher, and more and more methods were developed. They successfully completed the task and were praised by the leading organs.
    Emphasizing politics is not an easy task. This company's experience is that the process of emphasizing politics is the process of educating cadres. As new members continue to increase, ideological work must be carried out repeatedly. In the past few years, this company promoted several new cadres, some of whom emphasized technology and neglected politics, believing that "good military skills mean good politics." The Party branch first organized them to study Chairman Mao's military thinking, using the history of our army's growth and strength to illustrate that our army relies on politics and courage to defeat the enemy and grow stronger, making them realize that: politics is the commander, the soul, and the relationship between politics and military affairs can only be that of commander and commanded. Later, whenever the Party branch discovered that they had a tendency to neglect politics in their work, it firmly grasped it and repeatedly educated them. Once, during field training, some cadres were only focused on grasping technology. The Party branch immediately held a meeting, using the resolution of the Military Commission's enlarged meeting on strengthening political and ideological work in the army as a weapon, organizing them to discuss how to adhere to the "Four Firsts" in the field training, and educating everyone that political and ideological work cannot be relaxed for a moment, or one will go astray. Because the branch grasped the situation quickly and appropriately, it ensured the successful completion of the field training task.
        Emphasizing Politics Means Emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought
    The "Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Writings" of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region recently said, when discussing the experience of emphasizing politics: The fundamental foundation is to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and constantly arm the minds of commanders and fighters with Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Ninth Company is an advanced unit in the whole army in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and their experience in studying Chairman Mao's writings using the "small rectification" method is being promoted in many units. The company's leadership always focuses on the transformation of world outlook when leading soldiers to study Chairman Mao's writings. They say: The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation. To be responsible for the soldiers for a lifetime, the first thing to do is to lay a solid ideological foundation for them when they are young. They use "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as basic teaching materials, studying and applying them repeatedly, and constantly carrying out "small rectifications" to guide everyone to break with all kinds of individualism and establish the idea of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. When new soldiers arrive, they use articles such as "Serve the People" to pave the way, so that they understand for whom they are soldiers and for whom they are fighting. Before veteran soldiers are demobilized and return to the industrial and agricultural fronts, although many of them have become "Five Good" soldiers and activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings, the Party branch still seizes the last few days to help them summarize their learning experience and organize them to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" again and again.
    Transforming one's world outlook is not something that can be accomplished overnight. The company has always insisted on fighting a "protracted war" in its approach. They say: The struggle between new and old ideas cannot be won without several rounds, and Mao Zedong Thought cannot take root in the minds of soldiers without repeated education. Squad Leader Yang Lianfu joined the army in 1960. The Party branch organized him to study Chairman Mao's writings, corrected his attitude towards military service, and made progress in his thinking and work. Later, he developed complacency, only seeing his own strengths and not seeing his own shortcomings. In 1961, a soldier who joined the army at the same time as him joined the Party, and he became resentful, thinking that he had done a lot of work but the leadership did not see it. The Party branch helped him study "Serve the People" and taught him to use the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to correctly treat his own advantages and disadvantages. After a period of ideological struggle, Yang Lianfu's class consciousness improved, and he made rapid progress, joined the Party, and became a squad leader. The Party branch did not think that his ideological transformation was almost complete, but was always prepared to repeat and re-educate. In 1964, Li Zhenguo, who joined the army later than him, became a platoon leader. His mind started racing again, thinking: What am I inferior to him in? At this time, the Party branch again helped him study "Serve the People" and Chairman Mao's teachings on cultivating revolutionary successors, enlightening him to use his previous experience in ideological struggle to overcome his erroneous ideas, and his work made new progress. After several rounds, Yang Lianfu's understanding of using Mao Zedong Thought to solve individualistic thoughts became deeper and deeper, and the roots became more and more deeply rooted. He said: With more correct thoughts, one can sit firmly when turning a corner in thought. From then on, whenever a conflict arose between the interests of the Party and individual interests, he consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to solve it, treating others more modestly, and making faster progress in his thinking and work.
    The result of the Ninth Red Company emphasizing politics and constantly arming its mind with Mao Zedong Thought has not only made the company an advanced collective with red ideology, hard style, refined technology, and flexible tactics, but, more importantly, has laid a solid foundation for the soldiers to be revolutionary for a lifetime. Over the years, the soldiers of this company have been at the forefront and worked at the forefront during their service, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and have not changed their "red" character even when they return to their hometowns. Many demobilized veterans have become activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings and advanced producers on the industrial and agricultural fronts.
    Emphasizing Politics Means Technology Becomes More Refined
    The pilots of the "Aviation Hero Squadron" of a certain air force unit, who shot down two enemy planes last year, said when talking about the relationship between politics and technology: The more complex the technology, the more important it is to emphasize politics; only by emphasizing politics can one's thinking become redder and one's technology become more refined.
    Air hunters cannot operate their fighter jets in aerial combat without superb flying skills. In the flying profession, which is technically complex and very difficult, this heroic squadron, which was developed from the army and has repeatedly made meritorious achievements, always puts political and ideological work first. They say: Only by emphasizing politics can the ascent to technical peaks have a soul and a direction. They repeatedly study Chairman Mao's writings such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to firmly establish the idea of mastering flying technology for the revolution. They also regularly combine this with reviewing our army's combat history, inviting heroes of the Volunteer Army to talk about the war examples of defeating American jet aircraft with propeller aircraft, and constantly cultivate the spirit of "little tigers" who are not afraid of anything and dare to fight any seemingly powerful enemy aircraft. When solving technical problems, they always start with thought, first solving the ideological problem and then solving the technical problem, implementing politics leading technology and thought leading expertise. Last year, the squadron practiced a very difficult flying subject, but they could not practice it well no matter how hard they tried. At this time, the Party organization did not ask everyone to work overtime, nor did it simply drill technical difficulties, but instead first looked for reasons ideologically. When everyone opened their minds to talk, it turned out that some people were afraid of accidents when practicing new and complex technologies, which would affect the squadron's honor, and they were somewhat timid, even not daring to innovate when they should. In response to their own living thoughts, everyone first studied Chairman Mao's theory of laying down burdens and starting up machines, and reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win. With the burdens removed and thoughts enlivened, many technical difficulties were quickly solved. Soon, the squadron climbed to a new technical peak with excellent results.
    Pilots must be resourceful, decisive, able to fight and拼 (pīn, to go all out), where does this ability come from? The commanders and fighters of this squadron say: It depends on Chairman Mao's military thinking and Chairman Mao's materialist dialectics. Once, when studying how to use inferior equipment to defeat the so-called "superior" equipment of the enemy, which flies fast, flies high, and carries missiles, some people talked more about technology at the beginning, and the more they talked, the more difficult it became. Later, everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching that "weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor, the decisive factor is people, not things," and used the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to carefully analyze the advantages and disadvantages of enemy aircraft and our aircraft, and finally formulated a set of tactical principles for close combat, applying the glorious tradition of infantry "bayonets seeing red" and "200 meters of excellence" to aerial combat, and achieving one victory after another. Over the years, this squadron has used Chairman Mao's military thinking to break many "frameworks," correctly handled the relationship between offense and defense, the relationship between eliminating the enemy and preserving oneself, and the relationship between initiative and passivity in air combat, greatly improving the combat effectiveness of the troops, and continuously shooting down invading enemy aircraft, and is known as the indestructible "long sky iron hammer."

    突出政治出硕果
    在基层单位，在技术复杂的部门，如何突出政治？如何把政治思想工作摆在一切工作的首位，用政治统帅技术、统帅业务？荣获国防部命名的“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”、“红色尖兵连”和“航空兵英雄中队”等三个单位在这些问题上有着一些很好的体会。这几个单位由于长年坚持走突出政治的路，工作好上加好，连续五年都被评为四好连队
    突出政治是基层建设的根本
    怎样把连队建设成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化？广州部队某部“红色尖兵连”的体会是，最重要的就是要按照毛主席政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，坚持走突出政治的路。
      “红色尖兵连”是国际主义战士罗盛教生前所在的连队，在革命战争年代有着光荣的历史。一九六一年开展创造四好连队运动以来，又取得了新的成就，成了闻名军内外的一个先进连队。他们在长期革命斗争中，形成了这样一个传统：新战士一到连队，就进行政治教育。发给他们的第一件武器是毛主席著作，上的第一门课是阶级教育课，学习的第一个英雄形象是罗盛教。在平时，他们又坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想武装战士的头脑，把连队的政治空气搞得浓浓的，士气提得高高的。
    在这个连队里，每当政治与技术发生矛盾时，总是自觉地突出政治。他们说：只有人树立了胸怀全球的革命壮志，带着阶级仇恨、敌情观念去练兵，训练成绩才能突飞猛进。有一次，他们到北方执行任务，耽误了两个多月的训练，回来后党支部不是马上抓军事训练，而是用十多天时间，组织干部战士学习我国政府支援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的声明，重温《纪念白求恩》，并阅读了《南方来信》。通过学习，激起了全连战士的阶级仇恨，很快就掀起了苦练杀敌本领的热潮。几个月以后，他们不仅补上了出外两个月拖下来的训练科目，而且有了新的成就。
    时间紧、任务重的时候，政治与技术的关系容易摆不正，可是这个连队始终处理得很好。他们说：工作越多、担子越重，越要把政治思想摆在首位。去年五月，上级决定在他们连开游泳现场会，兄弟单位也来人参观。当时，准备时间仓促，不仅要练好动作，还要把几年来游泳训练的经验总结出来。面对这种情况，党支部提出要更加突出政治，坚持四个第一，不能“转向”。他们照常坚持天天谈，过党日，发动人人做政治思想工作。全连干部战士带着毛主席语录，先学习后下水，游完起来再学习，展开了炼思想、炼作风、练技术的竞赛，情绪越练越高，办法越来越多，出色地完成了任务，受到领导机关的赞扬。
    突出政治不是一件容易的事。这个连队的体会是：突出政治的过程就是教育干部的过程，随着新成员的不断增加，思想工作必须反复进行。前几年，这个连提拔了几个新干部，他们有些重技术、轻政治，认为“军事好就是政治好”。党支部首先组织他们学习毛主席建军思想，用我军成长壮大的历史说明，我军就是靠政治靠勇敢战胜敌人发展壮大起来的，使他们认识到：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治与军事只能是统帅和被统帅的关系。以后，党支部一发现他们在工作中有忽视政治的苗头，就紧紧抓住，反复教育。有一次野营训练，有的干部一个劲地抓技术。党支部立即开会，以军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》为武器，组织他们讨论在野营中如何坚持四个第一，教育大家政治思想工作一刻也不能放松，一放松就会走到邪路上去。由于支部抓得快、抓得适时，保证了野营任务的圆满完成。
        突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想
    沈阳部队某部“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”，最近在谈突出政治的经验时说：根本的根本是活学活用毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装指战员的头脑。
    九连是全军学习毛主席著作的先进单位，他们用“小整风”方法学习毛主席著作的经验正在许多单位推广。这个连队领导战士学习毛主席著作，始终把重点放在世界观的改造上。他们说：世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。要为战士负责一辈子，首先是在他年轻的时候给他打一个坚实的思想基础。他们把《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》作基本教材，反复学，反复用，并不断开展“小整风”，引导大家破形形色色的个人主义，立全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的思想。新战士来了，他们用《为人民服务》等文章开路，让他们懂得为谁当兵、为谁打仗。老战士复员回到工农业战线以前，虽然许多人已经成了五好战士、毛主席著作学习积极分子，党支部还是抓紧最后几天时间，帮助他们总结学习经验，组织他们再三学习《为人民服务》《将革命进行到底》等文章。
    改造世界观不是一蹴而就的。这个连在作法上，一直坚持“打持久战”。他们说：新旧思想斗争不经过几个回合不能取胜，要使毛泽东思想在战士头脑里扎根，不经过反复教育也不行。八班长杨连福一九六○年一入伍，党支部组织他学毛主席著作，端正了服役态度，思想上和工作中都有了进步。以后，产生了骄傲自满情绪，只看到自己的长处，看不到自己的缺点，一九六一年和他同时入伍的战士入了党，他又有了埋怨情绪，认为自己做了许多工作，领导上看不见。党支部一面帮助他学习《为人民服务》，一面教他运用一分为二的观点，正确对待自己的优点和缺点。经过一番思想斗争，杨连福阶级觉悟提高了，以后进步较快，入了党，当了班长。党支部并不认为他的思想改造差不多了，而是时刻准备再反复，再教育。一九六四年比他晚入伍的李振国当了排长，他脑子里又活动起来了，心想：我哪一点比他差？这时党支部又帮助他学习《为人民服务》和毛主席关于培养革命接班人的教导，启发他运用以前的思想斗争经验，克服错误思想，工作又有了新的成绩。经过几个回合，杨连福对运用毛泽东思想解决个人主义思想，理解越来越深刻，根子越扎越深。他说：正确的思想多了，到了思想转弯的地方，才能坐稳车。从此，每遇到党的利益和个人利益发生矛盾时，他便自觉地运用毛泽东思想去解决，待人接物更加虚心，思想和工作进步也更快。
    红九连突出政治，不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果，不仅使连队成了思想红、作风硬、技术精、战术活的先进集体，而更重要的是为战士革命一辈子打下了坚实的基础。几年来，这个连队的战士在服役期间走在先、干在前，一心为革命，回到地方也不改变“红”的本色，许多复员老战士成了工农业战线上的学习毛主席著作积极分子和先进生产者。
    突出政治技术才能越练越精
    去年一举击落两架敌机的空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”的飞行员们，一谈起政治和技术的关系就说：技术越复杂越要突出政治；只有突出政治，思想才能越炼越红，技术才能越练越精。
    空中猎手没有高超的飞行技术，是不能驾着战鹰凌空作战的。在技术复杂、难度很大的飞行事业中，这个由陆军发展起来的屡建战功的英雄中队，始终把政治思想工作摆在首位。他们说：只有突出政治，攀登技术高峰才有灵魂，才有方向。他们反复学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等毛主席著作，牢固树立为革命而掌握飞行技术的思想。又经常结合温习我军的战斗历史，请志愿军英雄讲用螺旋桨飞机打败美国喷气式飞机等战例，不断培养天不怕地不怕、敢于和任何貌似强大的敌机作战的“小老虎”精神。在解决技术问题时，他们也总是从思想入手，先解决思想问题再解决技术问题，实行政治带技术，思想带业务。去年，这个中队练一个难度很大的飞行科目，练来练去练不好。这时候，党组织不是让大家加班加点，也不是单纯钻技术难点，而是先从思想上找原因。大家敞开思想一谈，原来有些人怕在练新的复杂的技术时发生事故，影响中队的荣誉，有些缩手缩脚，甚至该创新的不敢创新。针对着自己的活思想，大家首先学习了毛主席关于放下包袱开动机器的论述，又重温了毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导。包袱解开了，思想活跃了，许多技术上的难点很快解决了。不久，这个中队就以优异的成绩攀上了新的技术高峰。
    飞行员必须多谋善断，能打能拼，这种本领从哪里来？这个中队指战员们说：靠毛主席的军事思想，靠毛主席的唯物辩证法。有一次，研究如何用劣势装备战胜飞得快、飞得高，并带有导弹的所谓“优势”装备的敌人时，开始时有的人从技术上谈得多，越谈越难办。后来大家重温了毛主席的“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”的教导，并运用一分为二的观点，细致地分析了敌机和我机的优点和弱点，终于制订出一套近战的战术原则，把步兵“刺刀见红”、“二百米过硬”的近战歼敌的光荣传统运用到空战中去，取得一次又一次胜利。几年来，这个中队运用毛主席的军事思想，打破了许多“框框”，正确处理了进攻与防御的关系，消灭敌人和保存自己的关系，空战中主动与被动的关系等，大大提高了部队的战斗力，连续不断地打下入侵的敌机，被人们誉为无坚不摧的“长空铁锤”。　新华社记者
