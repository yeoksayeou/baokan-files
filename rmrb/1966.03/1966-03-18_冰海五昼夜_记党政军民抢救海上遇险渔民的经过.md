    Five Days and Nights in the Frozen Sea
    —A Record of Party, Government, Army, and People Rescuing Fishermen in Distress at Sea

    In late February, off the mouth of the Yellow River in northern Shandong, inside the Bohai Bay, a severe snowstorm struck, and the temperature plummeted to minus seventeen degrees Celsius. From Tao'er River in the north to the mouth of the Wei River in the south, along hundreds of li of coastline, ice formed for more than twenty li from the shore into the sea. Except for the Yellow River, all rivers leading to the sea were completely frozen. This was a rare cold snap and freeze in this area in recent decades. Three hundred and ninety-three fishing boats and one thousand five hundred and thirty-eight fishermen from the Changwei and Huimin regions of Shandong Province, operating in this area, were all trapped at sea by the wind, snow, and ice. The boats could not move, the people could not disembark, and they lacked food and water. Their lives and property were in serious danger.

    At this critical moment, the Party, government, army, and people immediately took Chairman Mao's teaching of serving the people wholeheartedly as the highest directive, forming a rescue army, driving planes, warships, icebreakers, and fishing boats, traveling day and night to the chilling icy sea, and bravely rescuing their class brothers. After five days and nights of arduous struggle, all the distressed fishing boats and fishermen were rescued. It vividly embodies the Party and government's boundless concern for the fishermen in distress, the noble qualities of leaders at all levels and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces who are wholeheartedly for the people, and also powerfully demonstrates the invincible combat power of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
          
          Millions of Hearts Fly to Class Brothers in Distress

    This thrilling battle to rescue fishermen in the icy sea began on the night of February 21st.

    That day, the wind and snow were particularly heavy. At eleven o'clock late at night, the person in charge of the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Aquatic Products suddenly received an emergency call from the Shouguang County Bureau of Aquatic Products requesting the rescue of fishermen at sea, saying that more than one hundred and eighty fishing boats and more than eight hundred fishermen were trapped at sea by wind, snow, and ice. He immediately thought that the wind and snow were so widespread, if the fishermen in Shouguang County were in danger, would the fishermen in other counties be in the same situation? The Shandong Provincial Bureau of Aquatic Products made non-stop calls to various coastal areas of Shandong. That night, it was ascertained that only three hundred and ninety-three fishing boats and one thousand five hundred and thirty-eight fishermen from the Changwei and Huimin regions of the province were at sea. They immediately reported this situation to the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee. Mu Lin, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, immediately convened an emergency meeting to deploy rescue work, and sent leading cadres to the leading organs of the Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to request the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shandong to provide strong assistance in the rescue. At the same time, relevant units of the province also transmitted the situation of the fishermen in distress through several telephone lines to the Central Ministry of Aquatic Products and the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and relevant departments in Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, Tianjin and other places. In an instant, hundreds of thousands of hearts flew to the mouth of the Yellow River, deeply concerned about the safety of the fishermen in distress. Countless people immediately took action, consciously contributing to the rescue effort. They made all preparations for the rescue work in the shortest time and at the fastest speed. Workers at the Weifang White Iron Production Cooperative automatically worked overtime to rush-produce water buckets for airdrops; employees at the Weifang No. 1 Canteen rode bicycles to quickly deliver large quantities of cooked food prepared for airdrops to the fishermen to the designated location. Many staff members of telecommunications departments worked overnight beside their machines to ensure communication between the sea and land.

    On February 22nd, planes from various locations took off, warships set sail, and icebreakers and fishing boats also departed. Fishermen from Penglai and Changdao counties also suspended production, sailing motorized junks to assist in the rescue. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government, taking Jiao Yulu as an example, rushed to the front line of rescuing fishermen brothers. Liu Shengqing, Deputy Commissioner of the Changwei Region, was the first to board a helicopter to observe the situation of the fishermen in distress, and then directed the work of airdropping food and drinking water to the fishermen brothers, resting very little for four days and four nights on the rescue front. The Standing Committee members of the Shouguang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, upon hearing that so many fishermen in the county were frozen at sea, all volunteered to participate in the rescue work. Chen Shuxuan, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, was ill, and others advised him not to go. He said, "No, when the masses encounter difficulties, Communist Party members must appear before the masses." Having said that, he led the county's office cadres through the overwhelming wind and snow, straight to Yangjiaogou, jumped onto a tugboat, and joined everyone in fighting the ice, working continuously for two days, opening up the Xiaoqing River extending to the sea, and opening a channel for receiving the fishermen brothers in distress returning home. Wang Zhendong, the County Magistrate of Zhanhua County and a Communist Party member, also led cadres and the masses at Wanwangou, raising hammers to break the ice and clear the way, welcoming the return of the fishing boats in distress. Jiang Guizeng, Deputy County Magistrate of Shouguang County, and Zheng Quanyou, Director of the Bureau of Aquatic Products, each holding a cane, braved the biting cold wind, walked on ice and snow, traveled more than seventy li along the coast in one day, and found twenty-four fishing boats and seventy-two fishermen. Jiang Guizeng said, "As long as we can find our fishermen brothers, we are not afraid of suffering or hardship, no matter how much!"
        
        Wherever It's Most Dangerous, the People's Soldiers Appear

    In the rescue battle, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces have always taken Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people thoroughly and working for the interests of the people wholeheartedly and on not fearing sacrifice and overcoming all difficulties to win victory as their guide, engaging in heroic struggles with the ice, snow, wind, and waves together with the sailors and workers from the port and fishery fronts across the country. Wherever it is most needed, wherever it is most dangerous, they appear.

    Two jet planes and two helicopters dispatched by the Air Force and Naval Aviation flew thousands of miles in the freezing and snowy weather, making contributions to finding the location of the distressed fishing boats and airdropping emergency supplies. They appeared over the distressed fishing boats, throwing buckets of drinking water and packages of cooked food to the fishermen brothers. The fishermen, looking at the dry food and drinking water, were moved to tears and said: "This is the life-saving water and life-saving food sent by Chairman Mao!" They waved enthusiastically and cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    The soldiers who were tasked with rescue on the sea displayed the revolutionary heroic spirit of daring to brave mountains of knives and seas of fire for the people. Wang Youce, captain of a landing craft of a certain unit, found a fishing boat frozen in the mouth of the Mi River and immediately led his soldiers to advance at full speed, breaking the ice. When the bottom door of the landing craft was blocked by broken ice, Li Shouye, the electrician, crawled under the engine room and continuously removed the broken ice by hand, sending the fishing boat all the way from the mouth of the Mi River back to the Yangjiaogou fishing port. The water is shallow and the silt is heavy in the Yellow River Estuary, and the mud is as thin as slurry. Many fishing boats were frozen in the mud, making it impossible for warships to approach or people to pass. In order to explore ways to rescue the fishermen, Shi Weigang, political commissar of a certain naval frigate, and Zhang Kemin, secretary of the Party branch of the "Haitong" icebreaker, led several soldiers and boatmen, jumped on small sampans and headed towards the most dangerous fishing boats. The small sampan ran aground in the mudflats, so Shi Weigang and Zhang Kemin took the lead in jumping into the icy water. Shi Weigang said to everyone: "Comrades, Chairman Mao teaches us that our team is entirely for the liberation of the people, and it is for the interests of the people completely. Now that the small boat can't pass, we will break a path out of the seawater to rescue our fishermen brothers." After saying that, he led the soldiers, wading through the crotch-deep seawater, climbing over ice floes, stepping on mud, and boarding the fishing boat frozen on the ice. They conveyed the Party and the government's concern for them to the fishermen, and visited the fishermen after wading through water and climbing ice, making a detailed investigation of the ice conditions and thickness, opening a path for the rescue of fishermen from distress by small boats the next day.

    Li Wulai, deputy captain of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and the rescue艇 team he led, heard one day that a fishing boat from Yangkou Commune in Shouguang County was frozen in the shoal of Diaokou, and its specific whereabouts were unknown, so it needed to be rescued immediately. After Li Wulai and the branch committee members studied it, they decided to send five-good soldiers Liu Jieyi and Wang Yuhu into the water to find and rescue the two elderly people on the boat. Liu Jieyi and Wang Yuhu accepted this glorious task with excitement. They waded through thigh-deep ice and snow and mud, walking for a while, climbing on the ice for a while. While walking, Liu Jieyi suddenly felt dizzy and his eyes flared. He scooped up a handful of ice water and wiped it on his face, lifted his legs and walked again. They fought in the ice and snow for four hours and finally found the two old men in an ice den.

    The two old men had been fighting against the wind, snow, and severe cold for five days and five nights. Their hands were frostbitten, they lost the ability to break the ice and tow the boat, and they were short of food and water. Just at this critical moment, they suddenly saw their relatives, two big hands grabbed the soldiers' shoulders, and said with emotion: "Comrades, how can we thank you? What are your names?" The two soldiers stroked the old men's hands and replied: "Uncle, don't ask our names. If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao. It was his old man who sent us here."

          Unity as One, Overcoming All Difficulties, Breaking the Ice and Saving Ourselves

    The fishermen who were attacked by wind and snow and surrounded by ice were not discouraged in the face of difficulties. They earnestly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "determination, not afraid of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to win victory." Everyone on each boat was as united as one person, and full of confidence in victory, they launched a heroic battle against the severe cold and ice.

    After some fishing boats were trapped, their drinking water became less and less. In the most difficult times, everyone showed a noble style of caring for others more than for themselves. The fishermen on the "Qing Maoxing" fishing boat of the Guoju Commune in Zhanhua County drank less than a pound of water per person in two and a half days, and their mouths were dry and their lips were cracked. Cook Wang Xichun boiled the last bowl of water, brought it out, and asked Cheng Xiangfu to drink a few sips first. Cheng Xiangfu gently pushed the bowl of water to the mouth of Captain Li Shuxiu, and Li Shuxiu gently sent the bowl of water to Wang Chengxing's mouth. The bowl of water was passed around the mouths of eight people, and no one touched it. Captain Li Shuxiu said excitedly: "Come on, I'll take the lead and drink first!" His mouth opened wide, but he only touched his lips, and only then did everyone drink the bowl of hot water, preparing for a new struggle.

    The greatest threat to them when the boat was frozen at sea was that when the tide surged, the ice in some places was broken, and pieces of ice as sharp as knives slashed and crashed into the wooden boats and cables, posing the danger of destroying the boat and injuring people at any time. One night, the tide came. Wang Shouhu, the captain of the Xiaying Fishery Production Brigade in Changi County, squeezed his right hand into the stiff cable when starting the anchor cable, and all five fingers were broken. He endured the severe pain and insisted on fixing the anchor cable. He steered with his left hand and led three young crew members to fight the severe cold and ice for three days and three nights, without complaining or stopping work for a day.

    The fishermen on the fishing boats that were pushed by the strong winds and tides onto the shoals, in the difficult situation of losing contact with the land for several days and nights, were still full of energy and high morale, encouraging each other and breaking the ice to save themselves. The fishermen in Shouguang County who were frozen on the shoals said: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have sent planes and warships to save us, we must not wait here for others to save us. Let's open the ice layer ourselves and break out!" The next day, as soon as the People's Liberation Army and all aspects of the support army arrived, they picked up wooden sticks, axes, and other tools that could break the ice, shouted slogans, and broke the ice together with everyone to break out. They shouted the slogan "Overcome all difficulties and strive for victory", boosted morale, and smashed forward. In this way, they forcibly smashed a path on the glacier, enabling more than sixty fishing boats to break through the encirclement and escape safely.

          The Victory of Mao Zedong Thought

    All the distressed fishing boats and fishermen brothers have been rescued. The warships and boats that rescued the fishermen have returned victoriously. The ice and snow are melting, and the waves are rejoicing. People, with heroic feelings, recall the battle scenes of the five days and nights, and summarize the experience of this struggle against the ice. From the army to the local areas, from leaders to the masses, everyone agrees: the victory of this rescue struggle is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It not only saved people, but more importantly, it educated people. It tells people that the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be conquered by any storms.

    冰海五昼夜
    ——记党政军民抢救海上遇险渔民的经过
    二月下旬，山东北部的黄河口外，渤海湾里，受到大风雪的袭击，温度急剧下降到零下十七度。北至套儿河，南至潍河口，在几百华里长的海岸线上，从岸边向海里结冰二十余里。除黄河以外，所有通向大海的河流，全部封冻。这是近几十年来这个地区少见的奇寒冰冻。山东昌潍和惠民两个专区在这一带作业的三百九十三只渔船，一千五百三十八名渔民，全被风雪冰冻围困在海上，船行不动，人下不来，缺粮缺水，生命和财产都受到了严重的威胁。
    在这紧急时刻，党政军民立刻以毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导作为最高指示，组成一支营救大军，驾着飞机、舰艇、破冰船和渔轮，昼夜兼程，赶往寒气袭人的冰海，奋勇抢救阶级兄弟。经过五昼夜艰苦奋战，全部救出了遇险渔船和渔民。它生动地体现了党和政府对遇险渔民的无限关怀，体现了各级领导干部和人民解放军陆海空军指战员一心为人民的高贵品质，也有力地显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，具有无坚不摧的强大战斗威力。
          千万颗心飞向遇险的阶级弟兄
    这场惊心动魄的冰海救渔民的战斗，从二月二十一日深夜开始。
    这天，风雪特大。深夜十一点钟，山东省水产局负责人突然接到寿光县水产局请求营救出海渔民的紧急电话，说是有一百八十多条渔船和八百多渔民被风雪冰冻困在了海上。他立即想到，这次大风雪的面很广，寿光县的渔民遇了险，其他县的渔民会不会发生同样的情况？省水产局的电话，不停地打到山东沿海各地。当夜查明：全省只有昌潍和惠民两个专区的三百九十三只渔船，一千五百三十八名渔民在海上。他们火速把这个情况报告中共山东省委和山东省人委。省委书记处书记穆林，立即召开紧急会议，部署抢救工作，并且派领导干部到中国人民解放军济南部队领导机关请求驻山东的陆、海、空军大力协助抢救。同时，省的有关单位还通过几条电线，把渔民遇险的情况传到了北京中央水产部、交通部，中国人民解放军总参谋部和青岛、烟台、旅大、天津等有关部门。顷刻间，成千上万颗心飞向黄河口外，深切地关怀着遇险渔民的安危。无数人立刻行动起来，自觉为抢救渔民出力。他们用最短的时间，最快的速度，做好抢救工作的一切准备。潍坊市白铁生产社的工人，自动加班，赶制空投水桶；潍坊市第一食堂的职工，骑上自行车，把准备空投给渔民的大批熟食飞快地送到指定地点。许多电讯部门的工作人员，为了保证海上和陆地的联络，彻夜工作在电讯机旁。
    二十二日，各地的飞机出动了，舰艇出动了，破冰船和渔轮也出动了。蓬莱、长岛两县的渔民也停下生产，开着机帆船赶来营救。各级党政领导干部以焦裕禄为榜样，奔向了抢救渔民兄弟的第一线。昌潍专区副专员刘圣清，第一个登上直升飞机，观察渔民遇险情况，接着又指挥向渔民兄弟空投食品和饮水的工作，在抢救前线四天四夜很少休息。中共寿光县委的常委们，一听全县有那么多渔民冻在海上，都争着要求参加抢救工作。县委副书记陈树萱有病，别人劝他不要去。他说：“不行，共产党员在群众遇到困难的时候，就要出现在群众面前。”说罢，他就带领县的机关干部冒着铺天盖地的风雪，直奔羊角沟，跳上拖轮，同大家一起进行破冰战斗，一气奋战两天，打通了伸向大海的小清河，为接应遇险渔民兄弟归来开辟了一条通道。沾化县县长、共产党员王震东，也在湾湾沟带领干部和群众，高举鎯头砸冰开道，迎接遇险渔船归来。寿光县副县长姜桂曾和水产局长郑全友等，还每人拄一根棍子，顶着刺骨的寒风爬冰踏雪，沿海边一天走了七十多里，找到二十四只渔船和七十二个渔民。姜桂曾说：“只要能够找到渔民兄弟，吃苦再多，受累再大，我们也不怕！”
        哪里最艰险，子弟兵就出现在哪里
    在抢救战斗中，人民解放军陆海空军指战员，始终以毛主席关于彻底地为人民服务和不怕牺牲，排除万难去争取胜利的教导为指针，同来自各地港务和渔业战线上的海员和职工一起，跟冰雪风浪展开了英勇的搏斗。哪里最需要，哪里最艰险，他们就出现在哪里。
    空军和海军航空兵派出的两架喷气式飞机和两架直升飞机，在冰封雪飘中展翅千里，为探清遇险渔船位置和空投急救物资，作出了贡献。他们先后出现在遇险渔船的上空，把一桶桶饮水和一包包熟食投到渔民兄弟的跟前。渔民们看着干粮和饮水，激动地流着泪水说：“这是毛主席送来的救命水和救命粮啊！”他们热烈挥手欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    在海面上担任抢救任务的战士们，更表现了为人民敢闯刀山火海的革命英雄气概。某部登陆艇艇长王有策，发现弥河口冻住一只渔船，立即带领战士，开足马力，破冰前进。登陆艇的海底门被碎冰堵住了，机电班长李守业就爬在机舱底下，不断用手排除碎冰，一直从弥河口把这条渔船送回到羊角沟渔港。黄河口一带水浅淤沙多，泥稀如浆。不少渔船冻在烂泥里，舰艇靠不上，人也过不去。为了探索营救渔民的办法，海军某部护卫舰政治委员史维刚和“海通”号破冰船党支部书记张克敏，就带领几个战士和船工跳上小舢舨，向着最危险的渔船驶去。小舢舨扎到烂泥塘搁浅了，史维刚和张克敏带头跳进了刺骨的冰水。史维刚对大家说：“同志们，毛主席教导我们，我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底为人民的利益工作的。现在，小船过不去，咱就从海水里闯出一条道路，救出渔民兄弟来。”说罢就带领战士，趟着顶裆深的海水，爬冰块，踏烂泥，走上了冻在冰上的渔船。他们向渔民转达了党和政府对他们的关怀，又在这里涉水爬冰，访问渔民，把冰冻情况及厚度作了详细的调查，为第二天组织小艇抢救渔民脱险开辟了道路。
    解放军某部副大队长李武来和他率领的抢险艇队，一天听说寿光县羊口公社有一条渔船，冻在刁口浅滩一带，具体下落不明，需要马上组织抢救。李武来和支委们研究后，确定派五好战士刘介义和王玉湖下水寻找，救出船上的两个老人。刘介义、王玉湖满怀激动的心情接受了这个光荣任务。他们趟着大腿深的冰雪和烂泥，走一阵，在冰上爬一阵，正走间，刘介义突然觉得一阵昏晕，两眼直冒火星。他捧起一把冰水往脸上一抹，拔起腿来又走。他们在冰雪烂泥中搏斗了四个小时，终于在一个冰窝里找到了这两位老人。
    两个老人已和风雪严寒斗争了五天五夜，两手冻伤，失去了破冰拖船的能力，眼下又粮缺水断。正当万分危急的时候，他们突然见到了亲人，两只大手抓着战士的肩膀，感动地说：“同志，这叫俺怎么感谢呵，你们叫什么名字呀？”两个战士抚摸着老人的双手回答说：“老大爷，你不要问我们的名字，要谢，你谢毛主席吧，是他老人家派我们来的。”
          团结一心，排除万难，破冰自救
    被风雪袭击和冰冻包围的渔民，在困难面前也并不气馁。他们认真地学习了毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，每一条船上的人都团结得象一个人一样，满怀胜利信心向严寒冰冻展开了英勇的搏斗。
    有些渔船被困以后，食用淡水越来越少。在最困难的时候，人人都表现了关心他人比关心自己为重的高尚风格。沾化县郭局公社“青茂兴”渔船上的渔民，两天半的时间每人喝了不到一斤水，口干唇裂。炊事员王喜春，把最后剩下的一碗水烧开，端了出来，让程相富先喝几口。程相富把这碗水轻轻地推到船长李书修的嘴边，李书修把这碗水又轻轻地送到王成兴嘴边。这碗水在八个人的嘴边传了一圈，谁也没有沾一沾。船长李书修激动地说：“来，我带头，先喝！”他的嘴张得老大，实际只沾了沾嘴唇，大家这才喝下这碗热水，准备作新的斗争。
    船冻在海上，对他们威胁最大的是，在潮水涌上来的时候，有些地方的冰被冲破了，一块块锋利如刀的冰块，朝着木船和缆绳乱割乱撞，随时都有毁船伤人的危险。一天夜里，潮水来了。昌邑县下营渔业生产大队船长王寿祜，在起动锚缆时，把右手挤在僵硬的缆绳里面，五个指头都被挤坏了，忍着剧疼，坚持把锚缆整好。他用一只左手掌舵，带领三个青年船员，同严寒冰冻搏斗了三天三夜，没叫一声苦，没停一天工作。
    被大风和潮水推涌在浅滩上的渔船上的渔民，在几天几夜同陆地失去联系的困难情况下，仍然精神百倍，斗志昂扬，互相鼓励，破冰自救。被冻结在浅滩上的寿光县渔民们说：“党中央、毛主席派飞机、兵舰来救我们，我们决不能在这里等着别人来救。自己动手打开冰层突出去！”第二天，当解放军和各方面支援大军一到，他们就拿起木棒、斧头和其他可以砸冰的工具，喊着口号，同大家一起砸冰突围。他们高喊着：“排除万难，争取胜利”的口号，鼓舞士气，向前猛砸。他们就这样在冰川上，硬是砸出一条通路，使六十多条渔船，闯出重围，安然脱险。
          毛泽东思想的胜利
    遇险的渔船和渔民兄弟全部脱险了。抢救渔民的舰艇、船只胜利返航了。冰雪在融化，海浪在欢腾。人们怀着豪迈的心情，回想着五个昼夜的战斗情景，总结着这次和冰冻作斗争的经验。从军队到地方，从领导到群众，一致认为：这次抢险斗争的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。它不仅是救了人，更重要的是教育了人。它告诉人们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民，是任何狂风恶浪都不能征服的。
