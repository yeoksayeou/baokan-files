    Vice President of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association Zhang Jie and Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Durrani spoke at the reception successively. They said that the development of Sino-Pakistani friendship is fully in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of China and Pakistan. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Chen Yi will soon visit Pakistan, which will surely further promote the friendly relations between the two peoples.
    Zhang Jie said that China and Pakistan are close neighbors. The traditional friendship between the two peoples has developed to a new historical stage on a new basis after Pakistan gained independence and China achieved liberation. In recent years, cultural exchanges and economic cooperation between the two countries have been steadily developing, and border agreements, trade agreements, air transport agreements, and cultural agreements have been signed successively. The mutual visits of leaders of China and Pakistan have laid a solid foundation for friendly cooperation between the two countries.
    Zhang Jie said that the people of China and Pakistan have common historical experiences and also the common desire to build their countries into strong nations.
    This common desire closely links the people of our two countries together. The friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people cannot be undermined by anyone. With the joint efforts of the people of the two countries, friendly cooperation between the two countries will surely increase day by day.
    In his speech, Zhang Jie also wished Pakistan continuous new achievements on the road of independent development.
    In his speech, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Durrani wished that Sino-Pakistani friendship would become closer and stronger day by day in the days to come.
    The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim said that in the past year, Pakistan, in the critical moment of dealing with foreign aggression, the government and people of the great country of China gave us the most valuable assistance and support. We will never forget what you have done for us in our time of need. It ensures our friendship is one of sincerity and deep mutual sympathy.
    Referring to the upcoming visit of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Chen Yi to Pakistan, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim said that during this historic visit, the Pakistani government and people will not only make their best efforts to repay the Chinese government and people for the unforgettable welcome and warm hospitality given to the President of Pakistan a year ago, but also express the deep gratitude of every Pakistani citizen to China. Because China gave us assistance and support when we were experiencing the most critical moment of national survival.
    The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim said that in recent years, our two countries have been united in many aspects of our national activities, and we have linked ourselves together in many agreements. Our relations not only prove that these ties should link Asian countries together, but also prove that this sincere and deep understanding should prevail between two peaceful neighbors.
