    "Investigation is Solving Problems"
    Grasp First-Hand Materials, Strengthen Production Leadership
    Many Cadres in Jinhua Prefecture Go Deep into the Grassroots to Solve Current Production Problems
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th) Rural work cadres in Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, taking Jiao Yulu as an example, "don't eat other people's leftovers," are going deep into the front lines of production to grasp first-hand materials and help communes and production teams solve current production problems.
    Many county, district, and commune cadres in Jinhua, Qu County, Lanxi, Jiangshan, Yiwu, Kaihua and other counties, after studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, carried their bedding, brought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and shouldered hoes to go deep into the front lines of production. Five cadres of Huafeng Commune in Jiangshan County, barefoot, together with brigade and production team cadres, went to the fields to inspect the growth of green manure crops. During this inspection, they changed their past habits, specifically took small paths, and focused on checking mountain ridge fields and fields in remote and out-of-the-way places, discovering that among the commune's more than 3,000 mu of green manure crops, about 2,000 mu were second- and third-class seedlings. They also worked with commune members to rush to open ditches for drainage and apply fertilizer, draining all second- and third-class seedling fields and applying fertilizer once within a few days. Jiang Zengli, secretary of the Huafeng Commune Party Committee, went to Tanting Brigade to inspect the preparation of early rice seeds. Many team cadres said that they had prepared enough early rice seeds this year. Jiang Zengli recalled Comrade Jiao Yulu's saying that "eating other people's leftovers has no taste," so he personally went to the production team's warehouse to inspect and found that 300 jin of dwarf Nante high-quality seeds were lacking, so he organized mutual exchanges between production teams. The mountainous production teams of Tashi Commune in Jinhua County had always believed that planting chestnuts was not cost-effective in the past few years, so they had never planted them. Recently, Huang Shugen, secretary of the commune Party committee, conducted in-depth investigation and research in the mountainous areas, using a lot of investigation data to explain the benefits of planting chestnuts to the masses, and mobilized the masses to quickly plant more than 30,000 seedlings. When Guo Maolin, acting secretary of the Yongchang District Party Committee in Lanxi County, went to Huanan Commune to inspect work, he heard the commune cadres say that afforestation was almost done and that there was no place to plant any more seedlings. He recalled Jiao Yulu's investigation of wind gaps and exploration of quicksand and decided to go to the site for investigation. At this time, snowflakes were falling, and he led the commune and team cadres, holding umbrellas, to inspect the barren mountains in the snow. They climbed over one mountain after another and found that some mountains had trees at the foot but no trees at the top; some only planted in patches and not sparsely; and some barren mountains had trees but barren land did not. In this way, the almost-there thought that existed among the commune and team cadres was quickly dispelled by the facts, and it was decided to plant another batch of pine seedlings. All teams then launched a spring afforestation upsurge.

    “调查就是解决问题”
    抓第一手材料  加强生产领导
    金华专区许多干部深入基层，解决当前生产问题
    新华社杭州二十八日电　浙江省金华专区各县农村工作干部，以焦裕禄为榜样，“不吃别人嚼过的馍”，纷纷深入生产第一线抓第一手材料，帮助公社生产队解决当前生产中的问题。
    金华、衢县、兰溪、江山、义乌、开化等县许多县、区、公社的干部，学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹以后，背起铺盖，带着《毛泽东选集》，扛着锄头，深入生产第一线去。江山县华丰公社五个干部赤着脚，和大队、生产队干部一起，下田检查绿肥作物生长情况。这次检查，他们改变了过去的习惯，专门走小路，重点查山垄田、查远处和偏僻地方的田，发现全社三千多亩绿肥作物中，有二千亩左右是二、三类苗。他们又和社员一起，突击开沟排水，追施肥料，几天内把所有二、三类苗田排了一次水，施了一遍肥。华丰公社党委书记姜增礼到坛亭大队检查早稻种子准备情况，许多队干部都说今年早稻种子备得很足。姜增礼想起焦裕禄同志的“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”这句话，就亲自到生产队仓库里去检查，发现矮脚南特良种缺少三百斤，便组织各生产队互相串换。金华县塔石公社的山区生产队，过去几年一直认为种板栗不合算，所以一直没有种。最近，公社党委书记黄树根深入山区调查研究，用许多调查资料向群众说明了种板栗的好处，发动群众很快种下了三万多株。兰溪县永昌区代理区委书记郭茂林到华南公社检查工作时，听公社干部说造林已经差不多了，再来树苗没地方种了。他想起焦裕禄同志调查风口、探流沙的情景，决定深入现场调查。这时天空飘着雪花，他带领社队干部，打着伞，踏雪检查荒山。他们翻过一个又一个山头，发现有的山山脚有树，山顶没有树；有的只种成片的，不种零星的；有的荒山有树，荒地没有树，这样一来，社队干部中存在的差不多思想很快地被事实破除了，决定再种一批松苗。各队随即掀起春季造林高潮。
