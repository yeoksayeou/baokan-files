    After Shedding Personal Distractions
    Liu Jinzhen, Foreman of Company One, Engineering Bureau Number One, Ministry of Construction Engineering
    I graduated from a city construction school in 1962 and started working. When I was still in school, I thought: If I could pass the entrance exam to university after finishing technical secondary school and become an engineer in the future, that would be comfortable, both famous and profitable. If I couldn't get into university, becoming a technician after graduation wouldn't be bad either. Who knew that when I graduated, the principal announced that I was to go down to work as a laborer. My fantasies of becoming an engineer or technician were shattered just like that. I thought, if I'm going to be a laborer, I'll be a laborer; anyway, I'm not the only one going to be a laborer. I'm a technical secondary school graduate, with knowledge and culture, and I'll definitely be welcomed by the workers. Besides, I'm a girl, so I'll definitely be taken care of, and I'll get to be a mechanic or electrician, or at the worst, a carpenter. Who knew that when I got to Section Two of the Fourth Division of Company One, I was assigned to the bricklaying team, and my heart sank. At that time, our bricklaying team was an auxiliary team for the first bricklaying team, and we were either carrying bricks or stacking bricks all day long. Because I was sulking in my thoughts, I didn't say anything; when they told me to do something, I just buried my head and did it. In the evenings, I didn't want to go anywhere, so I just stayed in the dormitory embroidering and knitting. I just kept working like this for over two months, and then I was transferred from the second bricklaying team to the first team.
    When I arrived at the first team, our captain (member of the Party General Branch) took the initiative to talk to me, praising me for working hard and asking me to study Chairman Mao's writings carefully, especially "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." I studied these two articles several times, and my thinking broadened. Comrade Zhang Side's deeds of serving the people wholeheartedly greatly inspired me. I thought, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and the Party cultivated me. When I was in school, when I joined the League, didn't I repeatedly express to the Party that I would serve the people wholeheartedly? Now, carrying the burden of being overqualified, constantly considering myself, wanting to be a technical cadre, wanting to do easy work, how is this serving the people wholeheartedly? Besides, in doing revolution, what can we do without? Without bricklayers laying bricks, can factories be built? Once my thinking changed, I no longer felt that I was overqualified. With the thought of serving the people in my mind, I felt relaxed and full of strength. In the past, when my neighbors asked me what I did when I went home, I didn't dare to say that I was a bricklayer, but now I proudly answer: I am a bricklayer. In the past, I was always sulking, not talking or laughing, but now I can talk and laugh, and I feel very happy. In the past, I was afraid of going up on scaffolding, but now I have the courage to go up and down as I please. When the veteran workers saw that I was talking and laughing and working hard, they praised me and regretted me, saying: Da Liu is really good, it would be great if she were a boy, then she could do it for a lifetime. But I told them: This girl is going to be a bricklayer for a lifetime too.
    A year later, I encountered new problems. The leaders wanted to transfer me to the fourth work section to be a foreman. I felt very uneasy when I heard this, I didn't want to do it. Why didn't I want to do it? First, I had made up my mind to be a bricklayer for a lifetime; second, I had been learning for more than two years, which was equivalent to being a master craftsman, and I didn't want to change my profession again; third, I saw that cadres had so many things to do, it was better for me to be a worker, and once the work was done, there was nothing else to worry about. Soon, the leaders officially notified me to go to the mixing station to be a foreman, and I was even more annoyed when I heard it was the mixing station. I immediately thought that the mixing station had many contract workers and many difficulties. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said in "Oppose Book Worship": "Many people doing leadership work only sigh and can't solve difficult problems. They are annoyed and request a transfer, with the reason that 'their ability is small and they can't do it.' These are the words of cowards." Seeing this, it was as if Chairman Mao was talking specifically to me, and I couldn't help but calm down and consider the problem. I thought: I haven't even officially started working yet, and I'm already scared by a bunch of difficulties, and I keep saying that I don't want to do it, isn't this also a manifestation of cowardice? I also thought, why don't I want to be a foreman? Besides being scared by the difficulties, isn't there also the idea of seeking ease? So I made up my mind that I must do a good job as a foreman and never let down the Party's cultivation and the leadership's trust.
    After I arrived at the mixing station, I didn't understand the business at first and was not familiar with production, which was very distressing. What to do? After studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice," I understood that there was only one way: to seek knowledge in labor. On the first day of labor, I chose the dirtiest place—the mixer platform—to work. Although the mixer driver drove lightly, it was very difficult to discharge the material. When mixing started, the slurry splashed everywhere, and my face and body were covered with cement spots. My two years as a bricklayer made me understand that the dirtier and more tiring the place, the more cadres must not pick and choose their work, so that they can win the support of the workers and learn knowledge. In particular, the worker comrades are most opposed to the squeamishness of female comrades. Therefore, I am not afraid of getting dirty or tired, and I insist on working with them.
    After four months of working with the workers, I, an amateur who knew nothing about the mixing business, have initially mastered all the operating techniques of the mixing station and the structural principles of the mixer. Not only do I no longer speak as an amateur, but also if there is a shortage of people, I can fill in as a labor force. The four months of labor have also allowed me to establish a deep relationship with the workers. Now many veteran workers do not call me Foreman Liu, but call me "Da Liu". They are willing to tell me their innermost thoughts, and they can also criticize me face to face for my shortcomings. My physique has also improved.

    丢掉个人杂念以后
    建筑工程部第一工程局一公司工长  刘金贞
    我是一九六二年由城市建设学校毕业参加工作的。还在学校读书的时候，我就想：若是我读完中等技术学校能考上大学，将来当个工程师，那就安逸了，既有名，又有利；若是不能上大学，将来参加工作当个技术员也不错。哪晓得我毕业时，校长却宣布要我下去当工人。我当工程师、当技术员的幻想，就这样破灭了。心想，当工人就当工人，反正又不是我一个去当工人；我是一个中专生，有知识，有文化，一定会受到工人的欢迎；再说，我是一个女娃子，总得要照顾一下，少不了个机械工或电工，再背时也要分个木工。谁知到了一公司四处二段，却让我到瓦工二队去当瓦工，心都凉了半截。那个时候，我们瓦工二队是给瓦工一队当辅助工，成天不是抬砖就是码砖。由于思想上使闷气，话也不说，喊我干啥，我就埋着脑壳干；晚上时间，哪里也不想去，就在宿舍里绣花、打毛线。我就这样闷着脑壳干了两个多月，由瓦工二队转到了一队。
    到了一队，我们的队长（党总支委员）主动找我谈话，表扬我干活舍得卖力气，并要我好好学习毛主席著作，好好学一下《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》。我几次地学习这两篇文章，想的也就宽了。张思德同志全心全意为人民服务的事迹给我很大启发。我想，我是一个共青团员，又是党一手把我培养起来的；在学校的时候，在我入团的时候，不是一再向党表示要全心全意为人民服务吗？现在成天背着大材小用的包袱，处处考虑自己，要当技术干部，要干轻松的活，这哪里象是全心全意为人民服务呢？再说，干革命嘛，哪样离得了，没有瓦工砌砖，工厂盖得了吗？思想转过弯来了，再也不感到自己是大材小用了。脑壳里头装进了为人民服务的思想，周身感到轻松，周身都感到有力量。过去，回家隔壁邻居问我干啥子，我不敢说是当瓦工，现在我自豪地回答说：我是泥瓦匠。过去成天闷着脑壳，不说不笑，现在我也有说有笑了，精神觉得很愉快。过去上架感到害怕，现在我也有胆量随便上下了。老师傅看到我有说有笑，工作也起劲了，又夸奖我，又惋惜我，他们说：大刘真好，要是男娃就好了，就可以干一辈子了。我却向他们表示：我这个女娃子也要当一辈子瓦工。
    一年以后，我又碰到了新的问题。领导上要调我到四工段去当工长。我一听很不安，我不想干。我为啥不干呢？一来我已下定决心，当一辈子瓦工；二来我已学了两年多，顶得上一个师傅干了，不愿再改行；三来我看当干部这样那样的事情多，不如我当工人，活一干完就没事。不久，领导上正式通知我到搅拌台去当工长，一听是搅拌台，心头更恼火。我马上联想到，搅拌台合同工多，困难多。这时我又学了毛主席著作。毛主席在《反对本本主义》中说：“许多做领导工作的人，遇到困难问题，只是叹气，不能解决。他恼火，请求调动工作，理由是‘才力小，干不下’。这是懦夫讲的话。”看到这里，好象毛主席是专门对着我讲的一样，不由我冷静下来，考虑问题。我想：我还没有正式去干，就被一大堆困难吓倒了，一再推说不干，这不也是一种懦夫的表现吗？我还想到，我为啥不愿当工长呢？除了被困难吓倒，不是还有图轻松的思想吗？我于是下定决心，一定要把工长当好，绝不辜负党的培养和领导上的信任。
    我到搅拌台后，开头不懂业务，不熟悉生产，苦恼得很。怎么办？学了毛主席的《实践论》，我了解那只有一条路：在劳动中求知识。第一天参加劳动我选了一个最脏的地方——搅车台上去劳动，虽然搅拌司机开车较轻，出料却是很费力的，一搅拌起来，灰浆四溅，溅的一脸一身都是水泥点点。我当了两年多的瓦工，使我懂得了越是脏，越是累的地方，干部要不择活，才能得到工人的拥护，才学得到知识。尤其是工人同志最反对女同志的娇气。因此，我不怕脏，不怕累，坚持同他们一起劳动。
    经过四个月来同工人一块劳动，使我这个对搅拌业务一窍不通的外行，初步掌握了搅拌台的全部操作技术和搅拌机的构造原理，不仅再不讲外行话，而且哪里缺了人，我也能顶上一个劳动力了。四个多月来的劳动，还使我同工人建立了深厚的感情，现在好多老师傅都不喊我刘工长，喊我“大刘”。他们的心里话也愿同我说，我有什么缺点，他们也能够当面批评我。我的体格也练好了。
