    The great Mao Zedong era is an era of heroes.
    The heroes of this era possess the noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and selflessly serving the people, the magnificent ambition of serving the people of China and the world, the strong fighting will of daring to struggle and daring to win, and the heroic spirit of overwhelming all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy. At any time and under any circumstances, they put the interests of the revolution, the interests of the people, and the interests of human liberation first, enduring the test of war and the test of various political storms, selfless and fearless. Combat Hero Mai Xiande is also such a hero.
    Mai Xiande is only twenty-one years old and has only been in the revolutionary army for two years. However, his noble ideal of being a "volunteer" for the revolution and his revolutionary hard-bone spirit of fighting to the last breath have aroused strong reactions among the people of the whole country. Hundreds of millions of young people across the country and the broad masses of soldiers are learning from him and enthusiastically discussing: "Where does Mai Xiande's revolutionary hard-bone spirit come from? We live in the great Mao Zedong era just like Mai Xiande, what lessons should we learn from Mai Xiande's growth?"
    Mai Xiande's comrades-in-arms and leaders studied Mai Xiande's combat growth experience and answered these questions as follows: Mai Xiande's revolutionary hard-bone spirit comes from Mao Zedong Thought. Like other heroes of our time, the reason why he has grown relatively quickly is the result of our army holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, giving prominence to politics, adhering to the "four firsts," grasping and grasping living ideas vigorously, and realizing the revolutionization of people's thinking; it is also the result of him studying Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, working hard on the word "use," and honestly practicing according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The great Mao Zedong Thought armed him, the reality of the class struggle in the in-depth development of the contemporary revolution educated him, and the revolutionary furnace of the People's Liberation Army tempered him, so he embarked on the road of rapid growth on the road of revolutionization.
          Plant Class Hatred Deeply
    Mai Xiande was born in bitterness and raised under the red flag. He did not experience much suffering in the old society, and he did not deeply appreciate the sweetness of the new society. He entered school at the age of seven, but he did not study hard because his mother did not buy him paper and pens in time, and even lost his temper. How can he understand the happiness after liberation if he doesn't know the past suffering and hardship!
    This matter deeply pained his mother's heart. His mother took Mai Xiande's hand and sat down at the head of the bed, and told him about the bitter family history of generations who had suffered humiliation, exploitation, and oppression by class enemies: When his father was eighteen years old, he followed his grandfather to sail the sea, doing the work of an ox and a horse, and it was difficult to eat and wear. After the Japanese invading army entered Raoping, they killed people, robbed, blockaded the sea, burned boats..., and burned a boat used by his family and several poor fellows, cutting off the family's livelihood. His father and mother left their hometown and fled to Fujian to work, earning a load of sweet potato shreds in half a year. When they carried them home, his grandfather had already starved to death for two days, and his uncle was also buried alive by the landlord. His father was forced to raise oysters for the landlord, and was captured by Kuomintang bandits and beaten to the point of death.... His mother said, "Xiande, in the old society, where was there a way out for us poor people! We have been through three generations, and only your generation can go to school, but you...." Hearing this, Mai Xiande burst into tears and threw himself into his mother's arms and said, "Mom, I was wrong, I...."
    The bitter family history gave the young Mai Xiande his first lesson in life, deeply sowing the seeds of hatred for class enemies in his young mind. From then on, he seemed to have grown up a lot. Not only did he study hard, but he also actively helped his mother with housework when he came home from school, either weaving bamboo baskets or going to the sea to collect oysters.... When he was in junior high school, he also paid close attention to the stories of revolutionary martyrs told by the teachers, and paid attention to learning the knowledge about the origin and development of classes in the history textbooks, and drew circles and lines next to them.
    In August 1961, sixteen-year-old Mai Xiande participated in fisheries production and the militia. Here, he not only underwent the exercise of production struggle, but also further accepted the edification of vivid and profound class education. In the education of recalling bitterness, he heard people accuse: In the entire Raoping Jianzhou area, almost every family of working people has a history of suffering, and every household has a history of blood and tears. In Jianzhou Town alone, 192 fishermen were killed or burned to death by the Japanese invading army, and 234 fishing boats were burned. One bombing by the US-Chiang aircraft killed 19 people. The farmers Zou Lin and Zou Youyuan were forced to lose their families and die because they took four bricks from the bully landlord Mai Mingshan. Nine people were either beaten to death or starved to death, causing the two families to die out.... At the class education exhibition, he also saw a survey form of the crimes committed by the US-Chiang reactionaries in the Raoping Jianzhou area, and saw the clear contrast between the two disaster years: In 1943 before liberation, there was no rain for three months due to drought. Poor families were hungry, and every household fled from famine. More than 380 people starved to death in Jianbei Village alone; in 1963 after liberation, there was a severe drought for eight months, people, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the power of the people's communes, rose up to fight drought and created a miracle of harvest. It was here that he first heard militia battalion commander Mai Kefu talk about Chairman Mao's "Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society". Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is the primary question of the revolution." These, for Mai Xiande, who had not personally experienced class oppression and exploitation, played a major role in improving class consciousness, enabling him to recognize the enemy and us, distinguish between good and bad, and understand love and hatred. If class and class struggle were relatively abstract in Mai Xiande's mind in the past, then now they are concrete and vivid actual feelings; if the childhood Mai Xiande only knew about the family's hatred, at this time, he had integrated it with the suffering of the class brothers in his hometown. He repeatedly warned each other with the militiamen: "We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings. Although the era of oppression of our ancestors has passed, we must not forget the past suffering and hatred, and we must not forget the American devils, Chiang Kai-shek, and the landlord class that we have defeated. They are not willing to fail. As long as the enemy exists, there is a possibility of war. We must hold our guns tightly, sharpen our knives, study military affairs and stand guard well, defend the motherland, and fight the evil enemy to the end, and never let the bitter life of our ancestors come again."
    One day, Mai Xiande had just returned from the sea when he heard that there was an enemy situation. Without bothering to go home, he picked up his gun and went straight to the assembly point, and guarded in the sentry post in the cold wind until dawn. Another night, it was his and militiaman Liu Liangmu's turn to be on duty. Suddenly, dark clouds rolled and a typhoon struck. They ran to the boat to harvest the sails and rushed into the brigade's granary, which was about to be submerged by sea water, to transport grain. As soon as it dawned, they heard that the dikes of the salt fields of other brigades had been breached. Mai Xiande shouted "Go!" and ran to the rescue in the wind and rain.... He strictly guarded the militia's combat post in this way, while closely monitoring the movements of class enemies, while fulfilling the glorious duty of a class fighter in the struggle to protect the people's lives and property. He was praised by his superiors six times and was named a "Five-Good Militiaman".
    In 1963, as soon as Mai Xiande turned eighteen, he wrote three applications in a row, requesting to join the army. In an application on November 21, he firmly wrote: "Tonight, I listened to Uncle Kefu's (militia battalion commander) report, which made me further recognize the situation and realize that the US imperialism is often bullying us. In the past, the Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang harmed us. Our Jianbei Brigade was very miserable, and my family's experience was also very miserable. I am determined to sign up to join the army. This is my duty and glorious task."
          Set Revolutionary Ideals High
    When Mai Xiande came to a naval school in the Pearl River Estuary, it was the time when the upsurge of the whole army vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was even higher, and the army's revolutionary construction was deepening step by step. As soon as he joined the army, he was nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, influenced by the glorious revolutionary traditions of the army, and tempered by the fiery struggle life, which greatly accelerated the pace of his growth.
    Soon after Mai Xiande arrived at the school, he talked to the squad leader about his wishes. He said: "When I am assigned work in the future, I hope to return to the troops near my hometown!"
    The squad leader asked in surprise: "Then why?"
    Mai Xiande said excitedly: "My hometown is backed by mountains and facing the sea. Now it is a prosperous place. Before liberation, every boat was full of blood and tears, and every family cried. I have decided that I want to personally guard my hometown and avenge my relatives in the place where they were harmed, and never let those jackals harm people again!"
      "Speaking of class hatred, which family didn't have it before liberation? But,..."
      "Well, anyway, my request is also in line with the interests of the revolution!"...
    The instructor was very excited when he heard the squad leader's report. He thought: The seeds of class hatred are buried in Mai Xiande's heart, which is very valuable. However, as a revolutionary soldier, his mind is not broad enough and his revolutionary ideals are not high enough. To make him a soldier who consciously serves the Chinese people and the people of the world, a lot of arduous work has to be done!
    The company held a meeting to denounce the crimes of the US-Chiang gangs. Soldiers from all over the motherland angrily denounced the bloody debts owed by US imperialism, the Japanese invading army, the Chiang bandits, the fishing tyrants, and the landlords one after another. As Mai Xiande listened, he couldn't help but burst into tears. Ah! It turns out that these strange comrades-in-arms were all born on the same bitter root as themselves; everywhere in the motherland, every inch of land has the crimes committed by class enemies! He couldn't help but jump up and say: "Comrades, we all have hatred! Everyone's hatred is my hatred. We must firmly remember class hatred and vow to carry the revolution to the end!"
    One Sunday, the leaders led Mai Xiande and many new soldiers to the famous Humen Fortress. The old squad leader pointed to the ancient artillery fortifications on the top of the mountain in the distance and told them: More than 120 years ago, imperialism used gunboats to blast open the gate of China from here. This is the battlefield of the Opium War. Everywhere there is evidence of the crimes of imperialism killing the Chinese people, and every stone and every tree is soaked in the unyielding blood of the Chinese children....
    After the visit, the Party branch organized everyone to carefully study "Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society", "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune", study Chairman Mao's expositions on class and class struggle, and combine them with regular situation education and daily newspaper reading activities to let everyone analyze the situation from a class point of view, and guide everyone to care about the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. From these studies, Mai Xiande's mind was further broadened. He realized that two-thirds of the people in the world today are living the bitter life of the Chinese people before liberation, realized that the most vicious enemy of the people of the world today is US imperialism, and understood that as a revolutionary soldier of the new China, he must base himself on the army, keep the whole country in mind, look at the world, and serve the Chinese people and the people of the world "completely" and "thoroughly", and resolutely fight US imperialism and its running dogs to the end. He wrote down his determination in his notes: "Be a good red successor and never forget five things: 1. Never forget the past and never change; 2. Never forget that the revolution (fruits) is hard-won; 3. Never forget that there is class struggle; 4. Never forget to carry out the revolution; 5. Never forget to realize communism." He asked himself to "take over: 1. The proletarian class; 2. The class that carries out the revolution to the end; 3. The class of the excellent traditions of our army; 4. The class of class struggle and building socialism; 5. The class for realizing communism." He excitedly confessed to the instructor his original thought of "only wanting to be assigned to the troops near his hometown" and said: He vowed to contribute everything he has to the liberation of the world's people.
    At this time, the twenty-year-old Mai Xiande was concerned not only about the problems of his family, hometown, and country. He cared about the Vietnamese people's anti-US and national salvation struggle, the Laotian people's revolutionary struggle, and the struggles of the people of Japan, Congo (Leopoldville), and the Dominican Republic.... In the days when US imperialism was frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, he repeatedly studied "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and passionately asked the leaders to leave school and participate in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist the US as soon as possible. He wrote in his notes: "When people are beating a dog, the dog can only run away with its tail between its legs. When you don't beat it, it turns around and chases you, barking. It can only be solved after it is beaten to death. The same is true for US imperialism." When his request to leave school early was not approved, he turned it into a huge force and better did "one red heart, two preparations" in practice. He prepared to "pick up the gun and run to the battlefield without hesitation when the drums of war sounded and the order came," and contribute to the cause of world people's liberation; he also prepared that the combat mission could not come immediately, "The work assigned to me by the Party is my volunteer"; he poured the combat emotions of asking to kill the enemy into the long-term combat readiness work, and never slackened his combat will at all times. He worked hard to cultivate solid combat skills ideologically, stylistically, and technically. He asked himself to "be sure to fulfill the patriotic and internationalist obligations" and "make three preparations: 1. Fight against the US imperialist aggressors; 2. Fight against Chiang Kai-shek; 3. Aid Vietnam and resist the US." He said: This is my obligation. I will definitely contribute all my strength. As long as my breath is still panting, I will definitely fight on, and I will never succumb in front of the enemy, and I will resolutely liberate the suffering laboring people.
          Harden the Will to Struggle
    Comrade Lin Biao said that if you don't understand class, you don't understand exploitation, you don't understand revolution. From consciously and regularly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, from the reality of fierce class struggles at home and abroad, Mai Xiande deeply planted the seeds of class hatred in his mind, established the proletarian world outlook of serving the people wholeheartedly, and at the same time, it also prompted him to clearly realize that to make revolution, he must have the revolutionary hard-bone spirit of not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of fatigue, not being afraid of difficulty, and not being afraid of death, and highly consciously carry out arduous tempering.
    Mai Xiande had a stubborn personality since he was a child. When he went to the sea to catch fish, oysters cut a deep cut in the soles of his feet. He gritted his teeth and sewed it up with thread, without even telling his mother. However, after joining the army, due to his weak cultural foundation, he got two points in a row in learning the marine engineering major, and he couldn't help crying. He felt sorry for the Party, sorry for the revolution, and even thought it would be better to leave school early and do other work.
    The instructor asked him: "Mai Xiande, what does fighting mainly rely on?"
    He replied without hesitation: "Solid skills!"
    The instructor said: "Yes, you must have solid skills. But have you ever thought about what is the most important and fundamental thing? It is courage, it is politics, it is Mao Zedong Thought. Without courage, you can't rush forward when the enemy comes. What's the use of even the hardest technology? You have difficulties in learning technology now. Giving up in the face of difficulties is not an attitude that a revolutionary soldier should hold!"
    Mai Xiande was shocked. He thought, yes, Chairman Mao said that we are working and struggling to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. This is a good comrade. Why did I bow my head in the face of difficulties! If I don't dare to overwhelm all difficulties in peacetime, how can I overwhelm all enemies in wartime? He respectfully copied Chairman Mao's quotation: "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." to spur himself.
    At this time, a debate occurred in the class about "Is the material atomic bomb more powerful or the spiritual atomic bomb more powerful?". The instructor first told everyone the story of two ancient cannons near the school. One of the cannons was an earthen cannon made by patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Qing Dynasty, which had repeatedly defeated the imperialist warships. To this day, people still call it the meritorious cannon; the other was a foreign cannon bought from Germany by Qing Dynasty bureaucrats, which was a showy thing. The instructor said, why didn't the relatively modern foreign cannon kill the invaders, while the earthen cannon made meritorious deeds instead? The reason is that those who used earthen cannons were patriotic soldiers and civilians. They were not afraid of sacrifice and dared to fight; while those who commanded foreign cannons were feudal bureaucrats. They were afraid of imperialism and dared not resist. Then, the instructor told the story of the "Maritime Vanguard Boat" carrying forward the courageous spirit of bayonet fighting in the battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands in 1950, defeating the enemy's iron-clad warships with wooden-hulled small boats. After listing these examples, the instructor quoted Chairman Mao's words and said: "It is the people who decide the outcome of the war, not one or two new weapons."
    This class on "spiritual atomic bomb" further made Mai Xiande understand the principle that fighting mainly relies on politics, on people's courage and self-sacrifice. He became more and more assiduously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful spiritual weapon to guide him to temper his fighting spirit and overcome various difficulties, and at all times and in all places taking revolutionary heroes as examples, strictly demanding himself, and undergoing various hardships and difficulties in the fiery struggle. In about one and a half years after joining the army, he repeatedly studied "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" dozens of times, wrote more than a dozen notes of experience, and did it as soon as he learned it. In his daily life, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching on serving the people wholeheartedly and asked himself: "The work assigned to me by the Party is my volunteer. Resolutely be of one mind with the Party. Wherever the Party points, I will run to. I must learn from Comrade Zhang Side and contribute my life for the interests of the people." When planting vegetables, he rushed to carry manure; when sailing far away, he volunteered to cook for everyone in the sweltering engine room; when a fishing village caught fire, he rushed into the most violent fire to put it out; when a typhoon attacked the coast, he participated in the rescue commando team while ill....
    In combat readiness duty, he followed Chairman Mao's exposition that the nature of imperialism will not change and the teaching that if the enemy sharpens its knife, we must also sharpen our knife, and asked himself to use all opportunities to diligently temper his fighting will, "ready to eliminate the invading enemy at any time." Once, the combat boat was shooting targets, and he was lying in bed sick. As soon as he heard the sound of the main engine, he immediately got up, got into the engine room, and stood on his battle position. The squad leader advised him to rest, and he said, "The target range is the battlefield, shooting targets is fighting, how can there be a soldier who is still lying down when he hears the sound of artillery?"
    He was a new soldier and originally did not have training subjects under complex conditions. However, he eagerly requested to carry out "night tiger" training like the old comrades. He said: "The battle may happen tonight, and there will be casualties in combat. New comrades must also be as useful as old comrades. The situation is pressing!" The leaders understood his excellent results in completing the training subjects for new soldiers and approved his request. He worked hard to practice the ability to operate the machine in the dark and finally developed a set of "night tiger" skills.
    He knew that sea operations required a high degree of endurance, so he insisted on working in the engine room, which was more turbulent, hot, and small, during long voyages to conduct training. He did this exercise not once, but almost every time.
    He knew that cultivating the ideological style of continuous operations was very important, so after returning to port from performing a mission, regardless of how tired he was, whether it was late at night or in windy and rainy weather, he immediately cleaned and maintained the machine, tried to replenish oil and water, and prepared for another voyage before going to rest. He did this not for one day, but almost every day.
    He knew that every minute and every second was important to winning the victory of the battle, so he did not let go of any "small matter" that could shorten a minute and a second. In order to be able to quickly enter the engine room from the deck, he always slid down the hatch ladder when entering the engine room. He raced against time in this way, not for one thing, but almost for everything.
    How much perseverance does it take to do this "every time," "every day," and "every thing"! Persisting in this kind of tempering is arduous, but it is solid and effective for ensuring the formation of Mai Xiande's revolutionary hard-bone character.
    In this way, in the fiery revolutionary struggle, Mai Xiande armed his mind with Chairman Mao's thought on class struggle, made the hatred for US imperialism and all class enemies deep, set the ideal of world proletarian revolution high, and consciously fought against his own weaknesses, against objective difficulties, against violent storms, and against all "enemies" that hindered him from fighting for the revolution. The more he fought, the higher his fighting spirit, the harder his will, the redder his thinking, and the stronger his skills. He gradually tempered the heroic character of daring to overwhelm all enemies. With the heroic behavior of overwhelming all enemies, he practiced the oath of "not being afraid of sacrificing himself for the interests of the people" and reached the height of "exhausting his red heart" for the people.
      "A book by Chairman Mao is worth a thousand gold, the more I learn, the more I feel the truth of Marxism. It teaches me to love and hate more clearly, and it teaches people to become more and more clever the more they learn." This is Mai Xiande's personal experience, and it is also the fundamental experience and fundamental way for him to quickly grow into a glorious combat hero.

    革命硬骨头精神哪里来
    ——记战斗英雄麦贤得的成长
    伟大的毛泽东时代，是英雄辈出的时代。
    这个时代的英雄，具有一心为革命、忘我为人民的崇高品质，具有为全中国和全世界人民服务的壮阔胸怀，具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的坚强战斗意志，具有压倒一切敌人而决不被敌人所屈服的英雄气概。他们在任何时候、任何情况下，都把革命的利益、人民的利益、人类解放的利益放在第一位，既经得起战争烽火的考验，也经得起各种政治风浪的考验，无私而又无畏。战斗英雄麦贤得，也是这样的一位英雄。
    麦贤得，年仅二十一岁，走进革命部队只有两年。但他那为革命当“义务兵”的崇高理想，有一口气就要战斗下去的革命硬骨头精神，已在全国人民中激起了强烈的反响。全国亿万青年、全军广大战士都在向他学习，并且热烈讨论：“麦贤得革命硬骨头精神是从哪里来的？我们和麦贤得一样地生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，我们应当从麦贤得的成长中得到什么教益呢？”
    麦贤得的战友和领导研究了麦贤得战斗成长的经历，对这些问题的回答是：麦贤得革命硬骨头精神，来源于毛泽东思想。他同我们时代的其他英雄一样，所以成长得比较快，是我军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治、坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想，实现人的思想革命化的结果；也是他带着深厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，老老实实按照毛主席指示实践的结果。伟大毛泽东思想武装了他，当代革命深入发展的阶级斗争现实教育了他，人民解放军这座革命大熔炉锻炼了他，他就在革命化的大道上迈开了迅速成长的步伐。
          把阶级仇恨扎得深深的
    麦贤得生在苦水里，长在红旗下。旧社会的苦吃得不多，新社会的甜体会不深。七岁进了学校，读书不知道用功，因为妈妈没有及时给他买纸买笔甚至发起脾气来。他不知道过去的苦难和艰辛，怎么能理解解放以后的幸福呢！
    这事，深深刺痛了妈妈的心。妈妈拉着麦贤得的手在床头坐下，讲起了祖祖辈辈受尽阶级敌人凌辱、剥削和压迫的苦难家史：阿爸十八岁跟着爷爷行船走外海，干的牛马活，吃穿都困难。日本侵略军打进饶平以后，杀人、抢劫、封海、烧船……，一把火烧掉他家和几户穷哥们合用的一条船，断了一家的生路，阿爸阿妈背井离乡逃往福建做工，半年挣下一担地瓜丝，挑回家来爷爷已经饿死了两天，伯父也被地主活埋了。阿爸被迫给地主养蚝，又被国民党土匪抓去打了个死去活来……。阿妈说：“贤得仔，在旧社会，那里有我们穷人的活路！我们一家三代，就你这一代才能上学读书，可是你……。”麦贤得听到这里，满脸泪花，扑到阿妈怀里说：“阿妈我错了，我……。”
    苦难家史给童年的麦贤得上了人生的第一课，在他幼小的心灵中，深深地播下了仇恨阶级敌人的火种。打这以后，他好象长大了许多。他不但好好念书了，而且放学回家还积极帮助母亲劳动，不是编织竹篓，就是下海捞蚝……。他在初中读书的时候，还十分注意听老师讲革命先烈的斗争故事，注意学习历史课本上有关阶级的产生和发展的知识，并且在旁边画上圈，打上杠。
    一九六一年八月，十六岁的麦贤得参加了渔业生产和民兵队。在这里，他不仅经受了生产斗争的锻炼，而且进一步接受了生动、深刻的阶级教育的熏陶。在忆苦教育中，他听到人们控诉：整个的饶平汫洲地区，劳动人民几乎家家都有苦难史，户户都有血泪仇。光一个汫洲镇，被日本侵略军炸死烧死的渔民就有一百九十二人，烧掉渔船二百三十四只。美蒋飞机一次轰炸，就炸死十九人。农民邹林、邹有园，只因为拿了恶霸地主麦名山四块砖，就被逼得家破人亡，九口人不是被打死，就是被饿死，使这两户绝了后……。在阶级教育展览会上，他还看到一张美蒋反动派在饶平汫洲地区所犯罪恶的调查表，看到两个灾年的鲜明对比：解放前的一九四三年，天旱三月不雨，穷人家家挨饿，户户逃荒，光汫北村就饿死三百八十多口人；解放后的一九六三年，大旱八个月，人们在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的威力，奋起抗旱，却创造了丰收的奇迹。就在这里，他第一次听到民兵营长麦克复讲毛主席写的《中国社会各阶级的分析》。毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”这些，对于没有亲身经受过阶级压迫和剥削的麦贤得阶级觉悟的提高，起了重大的作用，使他认清了敌和我，分清了好和坏，懂得了爱和憎。如果说阶级和阶级斗争过去在麦贤得的脑子里还比较抽象的话，那么现在就是具体的、活生生的实际的感受了；如果说童年的麦贤得只知道一家之仇的话，到了这个时候，他已经把它和本乡本土阶级兄弟的苦难融汇在一起了。他一再地和民兵们互相告诫：“一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导。我们祖辈受压迫的时代虽然过去了，但是千万不能忘记过去的苦和仇，不能忘记美国佬、蒋介石和被我们打倒的地主阶级，他们是不甘心失败的，敌人存在一天，就有战争的可能。我们一定要握紧枪杆磨好刀，学习军事站好岗，为保卫祖国，同万恶的敌人斗争到底，决不让祖辈的苦难生活重来。”
    一天，麦贤得出海刚回来，听说有敌情，没顾得回家，拿起枪就直奔集合地点，在哨所里冒着寒风守卫到天明。又一天夜里，轮到他和民兵刘良木值班。突然乌云滚滚，台风袭来。他们跑到船上抢收帆篷，又冲进即将被海水淹没的大队粮仓抢运粮食。天刚亮听说别的大队的盐田堤坝被冲垮，麦贤得喊了声：“走”！又顶着风雨跑去抢险……。他就这样严守民兵的战斗岗位，在严密监视阶级敌人动向的同时，在保卫人民生命财产的斗争中，履行了一个阶级战士的光荣职责，先后六次受到上级的表扬，并被评为五好民兵。
    一九六三年，麦贤得刚刚满十八岁，就一连写了三份申请书，请求参军。他在十一月二十一日的一份申请书里坚定地写道：“今晚，我听了克复叔（民兵营长）的报告，使我进一步认清形势，认识到美帝是经常欺侮我们的。过去日本帝国主义对我们的残害，国民党对我们的残害，我们汫北大队是很惨的，我家的遭遇也是很惨的。我下决心报名参军，这是我的职责和光荣任务。”
          把革命理想立得高高的
    麦贤得来到珠江口海军某学校，正是全军上下活学活用毛主席著作的浪潮更加高涨、军队革命化建设步步深入的时候。他一入伍就受到伟大毛泽东思想的哺育，受到部队光荣革命传统的熏陶，受到火热斗争生活的锤炼，大大加快了他成长的步伐。
    麦贤得到校不久，和班长谈起了自己的心愿。他说：“将来分配我工作，我希望能回到家乡附近的部队去！”
    班长诧异地问：“那为什么？”
    麦贤得激动地说：“我的家乡背山面海，现在是个富足的地方。解放前，可是船船有血泪，家家有哭声。我算想定了，我要亲自守卫自己的家乡，在亲人受害的地方，为亲人报仇，决不让那些豺狼再来害人！”
      “要说阶级仇，解放前，我们谁家没有？可是，……”
      “那，反正我这要求也符合革命利益！”……
    指导员听到班长汇报，心里很是激动。他想：麦贤得的心里埋藏着阶级仇恨的火种，这是很可贵的。但是，作为一个革命战士，他的心胸还不够宽广，革命理想还不够高，要让他成为一个自觉为中国人民和全世界人民服务的战士，还得做许多艰巨的工作啊！
    中队里举行了控诉美蒋罪行大会。来自祖国各地的战士们一个接一个愤怒地控诉了美帝国主义、日本侵略军、蒋匪帮、渔霸、地主欠下的累累血债。麦贤得听着听着，忍不住放声大哭起来。啊！原来这些陌生的战友都跟自己生在一条苦根上；天南海北，祖国的每一寸土地都有着阶级敌人犯下的罪行啊！他忍不住跳起来说：“同志们，我们大家都有仇！大家的仇就是我的仇。我们一定要牢记阶级仇，誓死革命到底！”
    一个星期天，领导上又带领麦贤得和许多新战士登上了著名的虎门要塞。老班长指着远处山顶上古老的炮垒告诉他们：一百二十多年前，帝国主义就是从这里用炮舰轰开中国大门的。这里是鸦片战争的战场，处处有帝国主义屠杀中国人民的罪证，一石一木都浸润着中华儿女不屈的鲜血……。
    参观以后，党支部就组织大家精读《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，并且结合经常性的形势教育和天天读报活动，让大家用阶级观点分析形势，引导大家关怀世界人民的革命斗争。麦贤得从这些学习中，心胸进一步开阔起来。他认识到今天全世界还有三分之二的人民过着解放前中国人民的苦难生活，认识到了今天全世界人民最凶恶的敌人是美帝国主义，懂得了作为一个新中国的革命战士，必须立足部队，胸怀全国，放眼世界，“完全”、“彻底”为全中国人民和全世界人民服务，坚决和美帝国主义及其走狗斗争到底。他在笔记里写下了自己的决心：“当好红色接班人五不忘：一、永远不忘过去，永不变质；二、永远不忘革命（果实）来之不易；三、永远不忘有阶级斗争；四、永远不忘干革命；五、永远不忘集体”。他要求自己“接班要接：一、无产阶级的班；二、为革命干到底的班；三、我军优良传统的班；四、阶级斗争、建设社会主义的班；五、为实现共产主义的班。”他激动地向指导员检讨了原先“只想分配到家乡附近的部队”的思想，并且表示：誓为全世界人民的翻身解放贡献自己的一切。
    这时候，二十岁的麦贤得，关心的已不只是本家本乡本国的问题了。他关怀着越南人民的反美救国斗争，关怀着老挝人民的革命斗争，关怀着日本、刚果（利）、多米尼加人民的斗争……。在美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略越南战争的日子里，他反复学习《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》，满怀激情向领导上要求出校，尽快地参加到援越抗美的斗争中去。他在笔记上写道：“人在打狗的时候，狗只能夹着尾巴汪汪地跑了，当你不打它的时候，它又回头，叫着向你追来，只有把它打死后，才能得到解决。对于美帝国主义也是这样。”当他要求提前出校没被批准，他就把它变成一种巨大的力量，更好地以实际行动做到“一颗红心，两个准备”。他准备着“听战鼓一响，命令一下，毫无犹豫地拿起枪杆跑上战场”，为世界人民解放事业贡献力量；也准备着战斗任务不能立时到来，“党分配我的工作就是我的志愿”；把要求杀敌的战斗情绪，贯注到长期的战备工作中，时时刻刻不松懈战斗意志，从思想上、作风上、技术上苦练过硬的战斗本领。他要求自己“一定要完成爱国主义和国际主义义务”，“做好三个准备：一、打美帝国主义侵略者；二、打蒋介石；三、援越抗美。”他说：这就是我的义务。我一定贡献自己的一切力量。只要我的气还是喘着，我一定斗争下去，决不在敌人面前屈服，坚决解放受苦受难的劳动人民。
          把斗争意志磨得硬硬的
    林彪同志说，不懂得阶级，不懂得剥削，就不懂得革命。麦贤得从自觉地经常地学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的教导中，从国内外激烈的阶级斗争现实中，思想上深深扎下了阶级仇恨的火种，树立了全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，同时，也促使他明确意识到，要革命，就要有不怕苦、不怕累、不怕难、不怕死的革命硬骨头精神，高度自觉地进行刻苦的磨炼。
    麦贤得从小性格就比较倔强。下海摸鱼，海蛎子把脚板划了一道深口子，他咬着牙用线把它缝起来，连妈也不告诉一声。但是，入伍后，由于文化底子薄，学习轮机专业两分接着两分，他忍不住哭了。他觉得对不起党，对不起革命，甚至想不如早些出校，去干别的工作。
    指导员问他：“麦贤得，打仗主要靠什么？”
    他毫不犹豫地答道：“过硬的本领呗！”
    指导员说：“对，是要有过硬的本领。但你想过没有，最重要、最根本的是靠勇敢，靠政治，靠毛泽东思想。没有勇敢精神，敌人来了冲不上去，再硬的技术有什么用呢？你现在学技术是有困难，在困难面前，打退堂鼓，可不是一个革命战士应该抱的态度啊！”
    麦贤得被震动了。他想，对啊，毛主席说，我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。我为什么在困难面前低了头呢！平时不敢压倒一切困难，战时怎么能压倒一切敌人呢？他恭恭正正地抄下毛主席这样一条语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”用来鞭策自己。
    这时，班里发生了“物质原子弹厉害还是精神原子弹厉害”的争论。指导员先向大家讲了学校附近两门古炮的故事。这两门炮，一门是清朝爱国军民制造的土炮，多次打败过帝国主义的兵船，至今人们还称它功劳炮；另一门是清朝的官僚从德国买回来的洋炮，是个摆样子的家伙。指导员说，为什么比较现代化的洋炮，没有杀伤过侵略者而土炮反而立下了战功？原因就在于用土炮的是爱国军民，他们不怕牺牲，敢于斗争；而指挥洋炮的人是封建官僚，他们害怕帝国主义，不敢抵抗。接着，指导员又讲了“海上先锋艇”在一九五○年解放万山群岛的战斗中，发扬刺刀见红的勇敢精神，以木壳小艇打败敌铁壳战舰的故事。列举了这些战例以后，指导员引用毛主席的话说：“决定战争胜负的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”
    这堂“精神原子弹”的课，更进一步使麦贤得懂得了打仗主要靠政治，靠人的勇敢和自我牺牲精神的道理。他越来越刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作为指引自己磨砺斗争精神、战胜各种困难的强大精神武器，并且时时处处以革命英雄为榜样，严格要求自己，在火热的斗争中经受各种各样艰难困苦的锻炼。在入伍一年半左右的时间里，他反反复复地学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》几十次，写下了心得笔记十几篇，并且学了就做。在日常生活中，他遵照毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，要求自己：“党分配我的工作就是我的志愿。坚决与党一条心，党指到哪里就奔到哪里。一定要学习张思德同志，为人民利益而贡献自己的一生。”种菜，他抢着挑粪；远航，他争着在闷热的机舱里为大家做饭；渔村失火，他冲进火势最猛的地方去灭火；台风袭击沿海，他带病参加抢险突击队……。
    在战备执勤中，他遵照毛主席关于帝国主义本性不会改变的论述和敌人磨刀我们也要磨刀的教导，要求自己：利用一切机会刻苦磨炼斗争意志，“随时准备消灭来犯的敌人”。一次，战艇打靶，他生病躺在床上，一听到主机的响声，就立刻起床钻进机舱，站到自己的战位上。班长劝他休息，他说：“靶场就是战场，打靶就是战斗，哪有听见炮声还躺着的战士？”
    他是个新战士，本来还没有复杂条件下的训练课目。但他却迫切要求跟老同志一样进行“夜老虎”训练。他说：“战斗可能今晚就发生，作战就要有伤亡，新同志也得顶老同志用。形势逼人哪！”领导上了解了他完成新战士训练科目的优异成绩，批准了他的请求。他苦练摸黑操纵机器的本领，终于练出了一套“夜老虎”本领。
    他知道海上作战需要有高度吃苦耐劳的能力，就在远航时钻在摇摆比较剧烈、高温、狭小的机舱里坚持工作，进行锻炼。他这样锻炼，不是一次，而几乎是每一次。
    他知道培养连续作战的思想作风十分重要，就在执行任务返港后，不顾自己有多劳累，是深夜还是风雨天，都立即清洁保养机器，设法补给油、水，做好再次出航的准备，然后才去休息。他这样做，不是一天，而几乎是每一天。
    他知道一分一秒的时间对于赢得战斗胜利很重要，就不放过可以缩短一分一秒钟的任何一件“小事”。为了能从甲板上飞快进入机舱，他在进入机舱时总是沿着舱梯滑下去。他这样争分夺秒，不是对一件事，而几乎是对每一件事。
    要做到这“每一次”，“每一天”，“每一件事”，需要有多大的持之以恒的毅力啊！坚持这种磨炼是艰苦的，但它对于保证麦贤得革命硬骨头性格的形成，却又是扎实有效的。
    麦贤得就是这样在火热的革命斗争中，用毛主席阶级斗争的思想武装了自己的头脑，把对美帝国主义和一切阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，把无产阶级世界革命的理想立得高高的，自觉地向自己的弱点斗，向客观的困难斗，向狂风恶浪斗，向一切妨碍他为革命战斗前进的“敌人”斗。越斗，他的斗志越高，意志越硬，思想越红，本领越强，逐步磨炼出了敢于压倒一切敌人的英雄性格。他以压倒一切敌人的英雄行为，实践了“为人民利益，就不怕牺牲自己”的誓言，达到了“掏尽红心”为人民的高度。
      “毛著一书值千金，越学越觉主义真。教我爱憎倍分明，教人越学越精灵。”这是麦贤得的切身体会，也是他迅速成长为一个光荣的战斗英雄的根本经验和根本途径。
