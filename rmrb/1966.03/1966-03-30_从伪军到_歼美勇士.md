    The towering crimes of the American bandits have not only aroused the immense hatred of the South Vietnamese people, but have also caused some people in the puppet army to gradually awaken, recognize who the real enemy is, and thus abandon darkness for light, return to the embrace of the people, and turn their guns to strike the American aggressors. Nguyen Ngoc Vien, the "American Killer Hero" who attended the "American Killer Hero" conference in the central region of South Vietnam earlier this year and was awarded the third-class Liberation War Merit Medal, is one of them.
    Nguyen Ngoc Vien was originally a peasant. After he was forced into the puppet army, he witnessed every day the various atrocities of the American invaders and their running dogs in raping, plundering, killing, and arson, and also saw the suffering and heroic struggle of his compatriots. Once, he suffered extremely brutal punishments after opposing the looting of his compatriots' property by the American and puppet troops. All of this finally made him realize that the aggression of American imperialism was the root cause of all the pain and disasters of the South Vietnamese people, and that it was the running dogs of American imperialism who had dragged him into becoming cannon fodder. So he resolutely returned to the embrace of the people and joined the guerrillas. Under the education of the political instructor of the village guerrilla unit, he resolved to avenge the compatriots who had been killed by the American invaders and the South Korean puppet army. Nguyen Ngoc Vien participated in many battles. In particular, in the two battles in November last year to eliminate the nests of the American invaders and the South Korean puppet army in Cu Mong Mountain, he and his comrades, braving a hail of bullets, bravely rushed straight to the top of Cu Mong Mountain, firing fierce, hateful bullets at the enemy. He alone killed three American bandits and five South Korean puppet soldiers.
    In addition to Nguyen Ngoc Vien, five other puppet soldiers who returned to the embrace of the people with him have now become squad leaders in the main force, and others have become soldiers and mortar gunners in the local forces. They have all made meritorious contributions in battle.
    Nguyen Ngoc Vien, who turned from a puppet soldier into an "American Killer Hero," was warmly welcomed at the "American Killer Hero" conference in the central region. The road that Nguyen Ngoc Vien has traveled is the road of many, many puppet soldiers who have already awakened and are awakening.

    从伪军到“歼美勇士”
    美国强盗的滔天罪行，不仅激起南越人民的无比仇恨，而且也使伪军中的一些人逐步觉悟过来，认清谁是真正的敌人，从而弃暗投明，回到人民怀抱，掉转枪口打击美国侵略者。今年初，出席南越中部中区“歼美勇士”大会，并荣获三级解放战功勋章的“歼美勇士”阮玉园，就是他们之中的一个。
    阮玉园原是农民。他被迫当了伪军后，每天亲眼看到美国侵略者及其走狗奸淫掳掠、杀人放火的种种暴行，也看到自己同胞所遭受到的苦难和英勇的斗争。一次，他在反对美伪军抢劫同胞财物后连续受到极其残暴的刑罚。所有这一切，使他终于认识到美帝国主义的侵略才是南越人民一切痛苦和灾难的根源，认识到正是美帝国主义者的走狗把他抓去充当炮灰。于是他毅然投回人民怀抱，并参加了游击队。在乡游击队政治指导员的教育下，他下定决心，为被美国侵略者和南朝鲜仆从军杀害的同胞们报仇。阮玉园参加了多次战斗。特别是去年十一月间在消灭美国侵略者和南朝鲜仆从军的瞿蒙山巢穴的两次战斗中，他与战友们一起，冲过枪林弹雨，英勇地直扑瞿蒙山顶，对敌人发射出猛烈、仇恨的子弹。仅他一人，就打死了三个美国强盗和五个南朝鲜仆从军。
    除阮玉园外，与他一起投回人民怀抱的另外五个伪军士兵，现在有人成了主力部队的班长，有人成了地方部队的战士和迫击炮手。他们也都在战斗中立了战功。
    从伪军变成“歼美勇士”的阮玉园，在中部中区“歼美勇士”大会上受到人们热烈的欢迎。阮玉园经历的道路，正是许许多多已经和正在觉醒的伪军士兵的道路。
