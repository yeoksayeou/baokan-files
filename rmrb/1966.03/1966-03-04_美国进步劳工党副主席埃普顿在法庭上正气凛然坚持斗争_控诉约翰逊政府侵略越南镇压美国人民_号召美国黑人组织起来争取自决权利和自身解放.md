    Editor's Note: The speech of William Epton, Vice Chairman of the US Progressive Labor Party and black leader, in the American court, is not a defense, but an indictment of US imperialism. He relentlessly exposed and condemned the crimes of the US ruling clique in carrying out aggression and war abroad and implementing fascist rule at home, showing the heroic spirit and fighting spirit of a revolutionary with integrity.
    The American rulers have added unwarranted charges to William Epton's head and persecuted him because they fear the increasing awakening of the American people and want to use the police, courts, and prisons to stifle the people's revolutionary struggle. This is, of course, completely futile. The American ruling clique has long placed itself in the position of the defendant, and the trial of them has already begun.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The American reactionaries must first attack the American people if they want to launch a war. They are already attacking the American people, oppressing American workers and democrats politically and economically, and preparing to implement fascism in the United States. The American people should rise up to resist the attacks of the American reactionaries. I believe they will do so." The Johnson government is accelerating its path to fascism, and the American people will certainly rise up to resist. The more severe the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The persecution of William Epton by the American reactionaries will inevitably make the American people's struggle of resistance more fierce.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, New York News: The February 15th issue of the American weekly "Challenge" published the indictment made by William Epton, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Labor Party and black leader, who was illegally sentenced by the American authorities, during his trial at the end of January. Epton turned the defendant into the plaintiff in court, painfully revealing the crimes of the Johnson government in carrying out aggression and war abroad and implementing fascist tyranny at home, and expressed his determination to fight to the end against these crimes, regardless of government persecution. The following is a summary of this speech:
    You judge me "guilty" and put the labels of "criminal" and "dangerous element" on me...
    Now let us examine what is "guilty" in my words and actions.
    My crime lies in inciting people to oppose the (bad) conditions that exist in New York and across the country, in which my people are forced to live.
    I am found guilty because I organized grassroots residents of Harlem to oppose the police brutality that has been happening continuously in black areas for hundreds of years.
    I am found guilty because I rise up to fight for the liberation of all mankind - to get rid of this system of human exploitation.
    I am found guilty because I declare that capitalism is an oppressive system, and socialism is the only system that can allow mankind to live in peace and harmony.
    I am found guilty because I asked young black men: "What are you doing in the American army? Are you fighting your colored brothers all over the world who are fighting against the same government that is oppressing you?" "Is it in your interest to kill or be killed in order to support a racist government?"
    Finally, I am found guilty because I am a Communist - and a black Communist at that.
    If these are the "charges" for which I am found guilty, then I am guilty - and guilty thousands of times over. In fact, as long as the above (bad) conditions exist, I will continue to commit these "charges"; as long as I have breath, I will continue to fight against these conditions.
    Everything we do, everything we believe in - we do them and believe in them because they are in the best interests of our people. Yes, we are proud of what we have done in the past and are doing now, and we unreservedly insist on our actions.
    We say that the American government has nakedly exposed its face to the world - an imperialist-racist government; precisely because it is such a government, it must secure its lair, suppress dissent, and whip its own people into submission.
    Today, Epton and the Progressive Labor Party are on trial for their political views and activities. This is just the beginning. Tomorrow, on trial will be other heroic dissidents - spirited, active student movements; peace movements; university professors and teachers who are increasingly actively and openly opposed to the government's domestic and foreign policies; and intellectuals who see that the government says one thing and does another.
    Of course, as has always been the case in the past, the oppression of blacks will inevitably increase because they live at the very bottom, and they are the least afraid of losing anything in the struggle against this system.
    It is necessary for students, intellectuals, and workers to unite without delay to tie the government's hands while there is still time; and for the same reason, blacks must organize to fight for the right to self-determination and their own liberation.
    I declare publicly here that blacks will not walk into concentration camps, crematoriums, and gas chambers on their own. We would rather fight and die than allow ourselves to be treated like this.
    For those who treat this situation with indifference, I want to say to them, if a government can use gas and fire to deal with the Vietnamese people, then what can stop them from implementing the same policies here? If a government can suppress other peoples with fascist means, then it is only one step away from using the same means to deal with its own people.
    In the future, during trials like Nuremberg, it will never be Epton standing in the dock. On the contrary, Johnson, McNamara, Bundy, Rusk and the warmongering industrialists and their agents who wage war for profit will be tried for crimes against humanity.
    I have never done anything that is not in the interests of my people!
    I am open and aboveboard, I am true to my beliefs, and nothing can change this belief!
    My hands are clean. They are not stained with blood! I want to ask you - can the American government and its agents say that? (with picture)

    美国进步劳工党副主席埃普顿在法庭上正气凛然坚持斗争
    控诉约翰逊政府侵略越南镇压美国人民
    号召美国黑人组织起来争取自决权利和自身解放
    编者按　美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿在美国法庭上的发言，不是一篇辩护词，而是一篇对美帝国主义的控诉书。他无情地揭露和谴责了美国统治集团对外进行侵略和战争、对内实行法西斯统治的罪恶，正气凛然，表现出一个革命者的英勇气概和战斗精神。
    美国统治者把莫须有的罪名加在威廉·埃普顿的头上，横加迫害，是因为他们害怕美国人民的日益觉醒，想用警察、法庭、监狱来扼杀人民的革命斗争。这当然完全是徒劳的。美国统治集团早已把自己置于被告的地位，对他们的审判已经开始了。
    毛泽东同志说过：“美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。他们已经在进攻美国人民了，他们从政治上、经济上压迫美国的工人和民主分子，准备在美国实行法西斯主义。美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻。我相信他们是会这样做的。”约翰逊政府正在加速走上法西斯化的道路，美国人民当然要起来反抗。压迫越厉害，反抗就越强烈。美国反动派对威廉·埃普顿的迫害必将使美国人民的反抗斗争更猛烈地兴起。
    新华社三日讯　纽约消息：二月十五日一期美国《挑战》周报刊登了被美国当局非法判刑的美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿在一月底受审时所作的控诉发言。埃普顿在法庭上变被告为原告，痛揭约翰逊政府对外进行侵略和战争，对内实行法西斯暴政的罪行，并且表示将不顾政府的迫害，决心为反对这种罪行斗争到底。下面是这篇发言的摘要：
    你们判我“有罪”，并给我安上“罪犯”和“危险分子”……的帽子。
    现在让我们来考察一下，在我的言论和行动中究竟哪些是“有罪”的。
    我的罪过在于鼓动人们去反对那种存在于纽约和全国各地的，我的人民被迫生活于其中的（恶劣）条件。
    判我有罪是因为我组织哈莱姆基层居民去反对几百年来一直在黑人区不断发生的警察暴行。
    判我有罪是因为我起来为争取全人类的解放——摆脱这种人剥削人的制度——而斗争。
    判我有罪是因为我宣布，资本主义是一种压迫制度，社会主义是唯一能使人类生活在和平与和睦中的制度。
    判我有罪是因为我向黑人青壮年提出这样一个问题：“你们在美国军队里干些什么？是同全世界各地正在为反对压迫你们的同一个政府而战斗的、你们的有色兄弟作战吗？”“为了支持一个种族主义政府而去杀人或被杀，这难道符合你们的利益吗？”
    最后，我被判有罪是因为我是一个共产党人——而且还偏偏是一个黑人共产党人。
    如果这些就是我被判有罪的“罪状”，那么我是有罪的——而且犯罪何止千遍。事实上，只要上述（恶劣）条件存在一天，我就将继续犯这些“罪状”；只要我一息尚存，我将继续为反对这种条件而斗争。
    我们所做的一切，我们所信仰的一切——我们所以做它们和信仰它们，是因为它们符合我国人民的最大利益。是的，我们因为自己过去这样做了而且现在还正在这样做而引以自豪，我们毫不含糊地坚持自己的行为。
    我们说，美国政府在全世界面前赤裸裸地暴露了自己的面目——一个帝国主义——种族主义的政府；正因为是这样一个政府，它就必须要使自己的老巢有保障，压制异议，鞭策本国人民就范。
    今天是埃普顿和进步劳工党因为自己的政治见解和活动而受到审判。这不过是一个开端。明天，受审的将是其他英勇提出异议的人——富于战斗精神的、活跃的学生运动；和平运动；越来越积极地和公开地反对政府国内外政策的大学教授和教师；以及看清了政府说的一套、做的又是另一套的知识界。
    当然，过去一向也是这样，黑人所受的压迫定会增加，因为他们生活在最底层，而且他们在对这个制度进行的斗争中最不用担心会丧失什么。
    学生、知识界和工人有必要刻不容缓地团结起来，趁时机还不太晚的时候捆住政府的手；而且出于同样原因，黑人必须组织起来为争取自决权利和自身解放而斗争。
    我在这里公开宣告，黑人不会自己走进集中营、焚尸炉和毒气室去。我们宁可战斗而死也不让自己遭到这样的处置。
    对于那些以满不在乎的态度对待这种情况的人，我要对他们说，如果一个国家的政府能够用毒气与火来对付越南人民，那末有什么东西能够阻止他们在这里实行同样的政策呢？如果一个政府能够用法西斯手段镇压别国人民，那末这离开他们用同样手段来对付本国人民就只有一步之差了。
    将来在举行纽伦堡这样的审讯时，站在被告席上的决不会是埃普顿。相反地，约翰逊、麦克纳马拉、邦迪、腊斯克之流和那些为利润而进行战争的好战狂的工业家及其代理人，他们却将因对人类犯罪而受审。
    我从来没有做一件不符合我国人民利益的事情！
    我是光明磊落的，我忠于自己的信仰，没有任何东西能够改变这种信仰！
    我的双手是清白的。它们上面没有沾上鲜血！我要问问你们——美国政府及其代理人能够这样说吗？（附图片）
