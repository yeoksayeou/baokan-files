    This Generation and the Next Generation
    Nine Praises for Jiao Yulu
    Mao Yuren, Secretary of the Dongtai County Party Committee
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious life burst forth with dazzling sparks of communism.
    Facing this great warrior, I thought of our generation and also of our next generation. How should our generation spend the second half of our lives? Comrade Jiao Yulu set an example for us:
  “Dedicate oneself to the people, pour out one's red heart for the revolution.” How should we educate the next generation? Comrade Jiao Yulu also set an example for us: "Personal example is always more important than verbal instruction, be strict and conscientious, never careless." Only by transforming ourselves to the point of perfection like Comrade Jiao Yulu, filling our entire hearts with revolution, and directing all our actions towards the people, can we truly revolutionize throughout our lives, fight throughout our lives, dedicate ourselves completely, and continue until our last breath. Only by educating the next generation with the same strictness and conscientiousness as Comrade Jiao Yulu can we ensure that our successors never change their color, never deteriorate, and guarantee that the revolutionary cause continues to advance and the revolutionary spirit is carried forward.
    In the matter of educating the next generation, how to educate our own children well is a very important aspect. Comrade Jiao Yulu was strict and conscientious with his children, meticulous to a fault; he would not easily let go of a single theater ticket, a pile of peanuts, or a single wrong word. Gorky said: Even a hen knows how to love its chicks, but to educate them well is a great public service. Comrade Jiao Yulu is also our model in this regard; he fulfilled the responsibility that a Communist Party member should fulfill towards his children. Looking at others, comparing myself, I feel a lot. Now, some comrades consider the education of their children as an insignificant matter; they often emphasize being busy with work, having no time to take care of it, and push the responsibility onto schools and society. Therefore, among some children, there arises the phenomenon of being "politically superior, privileged in life, and careless in study," fearing hardship and disliking labor. What our grandparents worried about was their children and grandchildren becoming beasts of burden for the exploiting classes; what our generation should worry about is whether our children and grandchildren can "willingly be oxen for the people," and whether they can be the people's loyal "oxen." Revolution cannot be inherited, and there is no such thing as "naturally red." Therefore, we must not let our children live on the laurels of the older generation; we should seize the time to educate them, quickly occupy this position, and fill this gap.
    To transform ourselves well, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and plant red flags in our minds. To educate our children well, we must also use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to plant red flags in their minds, so that they understand "how to work, how to behave, and how to live," so that they love labor, are happy to endure hardship, have no sense of superiority, and have no special thoughts. Here, the fundamental point is to set a good example ourselves, like Comrade Jiao Yulu did for his children.
    Educating children is by no means a trivial family matter, but a fundamental plan for the revolutionary cause, and should not be taken lightly.

    这一代和下一代
    九赞焦裕禄
    中共东台县委书记  毛育人
    焦裕禄同志光辉的一生，迸发着耀眼的共产主义火花。
    面对着这位伟大的战士，我想到了我们这一代，也想到了我们下一代。我们这一代后半辈子怎么过？焦裕禄同志给我们树立了榜样：
  “鞠躬尽瘁为人民，掏尽红心为革命”。我们怎么样教育下一代？焦裕禄同志也为我们树立了榜样：“身教从来重言教，严格认真不马虎。”我们只有把自己改造得象焦裕禄同志那样炉火纯青的程度，使自己整个心里装满革命，一切行动为着人民，这样，才能做到革命一生，战斗一生，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。我们只有象焦裕禄同志那样严格认真教育下一代，才能使我们的接班人永不变色，永不变质，才能保证革命事业不断前进，保证革命精神发扬光大。
    在教育下一代的问题中，如何教育好自己的子女，是一个很重要的方面。焦裕禄同志对待子女，严格认真，一丝不苟，一张戏票，一堆花生，一句错话，他都不轻易放过。高尔基说：单单爱孩子们，母鸡也会这样做，可是要善于教养他们，却是一件伟大的公共事业。焦裕禄同志在这方面也是我们的典范，他对待子女尽了一个共产党人应尽的责任。看人家，比自己，感触很多。现在，有些同志，对待子女教育问题，认为是无足轻重的小事；往往强调工作忙，无暇顾及，把责任推向学校，推向社会。因此，在一部分孩子中间，就产生“政治上优越，生活上特殊，学习上马虎”的现象，怕艰苦，不爱劳动。我们的祖一辈担心的是自己的儿孙为剥削阶级做牛马；我们这一辈应该担心的是儿孙能不能“俯首甘为孺子牛”，能不能做人民的忠实的“牛”。革命是不能遗传的，不可能有什么“自来红”，因此，决不能让孩子躺在老一辈的荣誉上过日子，应该抓紧教育，迅速占领这一阵地，填上这块空白。
    要改造好自己，必须象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，在思想上插上红旗。要教育好孩子也必须以毛泽东思想为武器，在他们脑海里插上红旗，使他们懂得“怎么工作，怎么做人，怎么生活”，使他们热爱劳动，乐于吃苦，毫无优越之感，毫无特殊之想。这里，根本的一条在于自己以身作则，象焦裕禄同志那样为孩子作出好样子。
    教育孩子决不是家务琐事，而是革命事业的根本大计，不可等闲视之。
