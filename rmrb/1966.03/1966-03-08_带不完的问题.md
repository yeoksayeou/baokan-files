    Problems That Can Never Be Exhausted
    Guo Chaoxu
    Studying Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime is the only way to make revolution for a lifetime. This truth is recognized by more and more people. Studying Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind is a common experience summarized by all active learners. However, some people still think that they have no problems to bring, let alone have problems to bring often.
    Wang Jie said: "There are absolutely no times where there are no problems to bring, instead there are problems that can never be exhausted." These words are thought-provoking.
    Is it true that there are no problems to bring? No. Contradiction is universally present, and contradiction is a problem. Comrades with many ideological shortcomings and who do not do well in their work have problems to bring; comrades who have achieved some success in their work also have problems to bring. Because things are always divided into two, even after winning a battle, we must look for shortcomings and when summing up experience, we must also examine lessons learned, so how can there be no problems? There are only a few reasons for thinking that there are no problems to bring: first, fear, not daring to actively carry out ideological struggle, fearing exposing problems; second, laziness, not using their brains to think about problems; third, pride, having complacent emotions, talking about achievements with relish, and being indifferent when talking about problems. Problems always exist, just as Wang Jie said: "As long as you are doing revolution and doing work, you will constantly encounter various problems, old ones are solved, and new problems will appear. Where there is work, where there is struggle, there will be problems to bring for study." The fundamental reasons for not seeing the problems, in addition to lacking revolutionary consciousness and revolutionary dedication, are also metaphysical in terms of ideological methods. The blindness and one-sidedness of not seeing problems is terrible, and "no problems" is itself a problem.
    Problems are endless. The contradictions of things are endless, and people's thoughts and work are also developing and changing, and cannot remain stagnant. For a unit, to make the political atmosphere strong, the work done well, the unity tight, and the consciousness of the masses raised high, there are endless problems to consult Chairman Mao's works on. In terms of people's ideological transformation, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology; promoting collectivism and eliminating individualism; promoting dialectical materialism and eliminating metaphysics, is a long-term struggle process. The transformation of world view is a lifelong matter for every revolutionary, a repeated process of constantly arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought and solving problems. Whether it is a unit or an individual, to achieve discovery, invention, creation, and progress, we must constantly solve this and that kind of problem.
    Wang Jie's belief that there are endless problems is a manifestation of continuous revolution, thorough revolution, and conscious revolution. Therefore, he regards studying Chairman Mao's works as a "lifelong affair" and is determined to "persist in learning for a long time."
    Problems that can never be exhausted spur us to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime!

    带不完的问题
    郭朝绪
    读一辈子毛主席的书，才能干一辈子革命。这个真理被越来越多的人认识了。带着问题学习毛主席著作，这是所有学习积极分子总结出来的一条共同经验。但是也还有人认为，没有问题好带，更不会经常有问题好带。
    王杰说：“绝不是没有问题可带，倒有带不完的问题”。这话促人深思。
    是不是没有问题可带？不然。矛盾是普遍存在的，矛盾就是问题。思想毛病多，工作做得不怎么好的同志有问题可带；工作有点成绩的同志也有问题可带。因为事物总是一分为二的，打了胜仗还要找缺点，总结经验还得查教训，怎么会没有问题呢？认为没有问题可带，不外乎几个原因：一是怕，不敢积极开展思想斗争，怕暴露问题；二是懒，不开动脑筋去思索问题；三是骄，存在骄傲自满情绪，谈成绩津津乐道，谈问题满不在乎。问题总是有的，正如王杰所说：“只要是干革命做工作，总会不断地遇到各种各样的问题，老的解决了，新的问题又会出现。哪里有工作哪里有斗争，哪里就会有问题可以带着学”。看不到问题的根本原因，除了缺乏革命自觉性和革命事业心之外，就是思想方法上的形而上学。看不到问题的盲目性和片面性是可怕的，“没有问题”本身就是问题。
    问题是带不完的。事物的矛盾是无穷无尽的，人们的思想和工作也是发展的、变化的，不能停留在原地踏步。就一个单位来说，要把政治空气搞得浓浓的，工作搞得好好的，团结搞得紧紧的，群众的觉悟提得高高的，就有带不完的问题要请教毛主席著作。就人的思想改造来说，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想；兴集体主义，灭个人主义；兴辩证唯物主义，灭形而上学，就是一个长期的斗争过程。世界观的改造，对每个革命者来说，是一辈子的事，是一个不断用毛主席思想武装头脑、解决问题的反复过程。无论是一个单位和个人，要做到有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，就要不断地解决这种那种的问题。
    王杰认为有带不完的问题，是不断革命、彻底革命、自觉革命的表现。所以他把学习毛主席著作，当作是“一辈子的事情”，决心“把学习长期坚持下去”。
    带不完的问题，鞭策着我们活学活用一辈子毛主席著作！
