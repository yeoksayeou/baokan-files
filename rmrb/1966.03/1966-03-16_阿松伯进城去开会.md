　　Busy with the autumn harvest, joyous news spread throughout the village; Uncle Song is going to the county town to attend the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference. Shouldering his manure basket and leaving home, the cold wind assaults his face; Uncle Song walks along, accumulating fertilizer all the way. One basket after another poured into the fields, regardless of which commune or team it belongs to! The boundless land is tightly connected, and Uncle Song has no boundary markers in his heart! As long as ten thousand miles of wheat seedlings are lush, as long as grain piles up everywhere, strings of sweat turn into dew, and he doesn't feel tired from the journey! Walking forward under the sun, a red flag waves to him, Uncle Song puffs out his chest, ready to attend the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference.

    阿松伯进城去开会
   宫玺忙罢了大秋，喜讯绕村飞；阿松伯要到县城去，参加贫下中农代表会。背起粪筐离家门，寒风扑面吹；阿松伯一路行走，一路积肥。一筐一筐田里倒，管它是哪个公社哪个队！无边土地紧相连，阿松伯心上没界碑！只要万里麦苗翠，只要处处粮成堆，串串汗珠变露水，一路辛苦不觉累！顶着太阳朝前走，迎面红旗把手挥，阿松伯挺起胸膛，去参加贫下中农代表会。
