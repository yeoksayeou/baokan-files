    Philippines
    U.S. Military Base for Aggression Against Southeast Asia
    The Philippines, composed of over seven thousand islands, is located between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, to the southeast of China, and has long been a colony of U.S. imperialism. The United States has consistently regarded the Philippines as an important strategic base for its aggression against Southeast Asia. The United States occupies over twenty land, sea, and air force bases and facilities in the Philippines, stations more than 16,000 U.S. troops there, and has dispatched a "U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to the Philippines," which exercises direct and comprehensive control over the Philippine army.
    For many years, U.S. imperialism has used the Philippines as the southern strategic center of its "island chain" in the Pacific, interfering in and aggressing against Indochina and various parts of Southeast Asia. In 1962, the United States trained South Vietnamese puppet troops at Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines. Since last year, as the United States has frantically expanded its war of aggression against Vietnam, it has further intensified its use of its bases in the Philippines as a springboard for the war. Most of the aggressive troops it has dispatched to South Vietnam and Thailand have been transferred via the Philippines or directly dispatched from bases in the Philippines. U.S. bandit planes bombing North Vietnam and the Lao liberated areas also frequently take off from Clark Air Base in the Philippines. As early as August and September of last year, Philippine newspapers already revealed that the United States had an average of 300 planes taking off from Philippine bases every day to carry out military missions in Vietnam; the average number of U.S. military vessels involved in the aggression against Vietnam entering and leaving Subic Bay Naval Base each month also increased from 30 to 40 in June 1964 to 160 to 180 at that time.
    The Philippines is also a logistical base for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. In order to alleviate the difficulty of the United States' depleting troop resources, the United States has also been putting pressure on the Philippines, coercing it to provide cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Vietnam. According to the U.S. intentions, the Philippines has already sent economic and technical "aid" groups and "medical technicians" to South Vietnam in July 1964 and March of last year. On February 22 this year, Philippine President Marcos, under repeated urging from the United States, announced that he would send 2,000 "engineering" troops to South Vietnam to die.
    U.S. military activities in the Philippines have brought great disasters to the Filipino people. As the chairman of a Philippine farmers' association pointed out, these arrogant acts of the U.S. military "make a mockery of Philippine sovereignty."

### 菲律宾  美国侵略东南亚军事基地

    菲律宾
    美国侵略东南亚军事基地
    菲律宾由七千多个岛屿组成，位置在南中国海和太平洋之间，在中国的东南方，曾经长期是美帝国主义的殖民地。美国也一直把菲律宾当作它侵略东南亚的重要战略基地。美国在菲律宾占有二十多处陆、海、空军基地和设施，驻有一万六千多名美军，并且派有“美国驻菲律宾联合军事顾问团”，对菲律宾军队进行着直接和全面的控制。
    多年来，美帝国主义就以菲律宾作为它在太平洋的“岛屿锁链”的南部战略中心，干涉和侵略印度支那和东南亚各地。一九六二年，美国曾在菲律宾的苏比克基地训练南越傀儡军队。去年以来，随着美国疯狂扩大侵越战争，它更加紧利用它在菲律宾的基地作为侵越战争的跳板。它向南越和泰国增派的侵略军大多经由菲律宾转运，或者直接从菲律宾的基地派出。轰炸越南北方和老挝解放区的美国强盗飞机也经常从菲律宾的克拉克基地起飞。早在去年八、九月间，菲律宾报纸就已经透露，美国平均每天有三百架飞机从菲律宾的基地起飞到越南去执行军事任务；每月平均出入苏比克海军基地的侵越美军舰只，也从一九六四年六月的三、四十艘增加到当时的一百六十到一百八十艘。
    菲律宾也是美国侵越战争的后勤基地。为了解救美国兵源枯竭的困难，美国还一直对菲律宾施加压力，胁迫菲律宾提供侵越炮灰。根据美国的意旨，菲律宾已经在一九六四年七月和去年三月先后向南越派出了经济技术“援助”小组和“医疗技术人员”。今年二月二十二日，菲律宾总统马科斯在美国一再催促下又宣布将派二千名“工程”部队去南越送死。
    美国在菲律宾的军事活动给菲律宾人民带来巨大的灾难。正如菲律宾一个农民协会的主席所指出的，美军的这种横蛮行为，“使菲律宾的主权成为笑柄”。　（据新华社）（附图片）
