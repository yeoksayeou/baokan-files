    Twists and Turns and Forward Progress
    Xiang Donghui

    Don't you see the Yellow River's mighty power, flowing from the heavens afar? It roars for thousands of miles, splitting the earth, its whirlpools swirling back with thunderous sound. It winds through nine bends and flows eastward again, carving mountains and burying valleys, opening the vast ocean...
                                     ——《Yellow River Song》

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The road of revolution, like the road of all things in the world, is always tortuous, not straight." He also said: "There is no straight road in the world; we must be prepared to take a tortuous road"; "The future is bright; the road is tortuous."

    The great revolutionary tide of the contemporary world is precisely like this. Look, like the mighty Yellow River, encountering high mountains and deep valleys, even though it "swirls back in whirlpools" and "winds through nine bends," it still rushes forward with its majestic momentum, sweeping thousands of miles.

    Both twists and turns and forward progress form a dialectical unity; it is a universal law of revolutionary development. In the course of revolutionary development, the emergence of this or that twist or turn is unavoidable. Revolution advances continuously through twists and turns.

    Why do such or such twists and turns always appear on the road of revolutionary progress? This is because revolution is a constant struggle between the new and the decaying forces. Sometimes, due to a temporary imbalance in power unfavorable to the revolutionary side, sometimes due to subjective errors of the revolutionary leadership, this or that twist or turn will be created on the road of revolutionary progress. In short, the growth of new things must go through repeated struggles.

    "On Contradiction" tells us: "Within any thing, there are contradictions between its new and old aspects, forming a series of tortuous struggles. As a result of the struggle, the new aspect grows from small to large and rises to become the dominant thing, while the old aspect shrinks from large to small and gradually moves towards extinction." This means that both the rising process of new things and the declining process of decadent forces are tortuous. New forces can only gain a dominant position by engaging in repeated struggles with decadent forces.

    Looking at problems from the perspective of dialectical materialism, we will understand that it is not surprising that twists and turns appear on the revolutionary road; and that, no matter what kind of twist or turn, it cannot change the direction of revolutionary progress.

    The current international situation is one where the East wind prevails over the West wind. But this does not mean that there are no twists and turns in such a favorable situation. Imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys, led by the United States, are launching frantic counterattacks; modern revisionism is acting as an accomplice to imperialism and reactionaries, undermining the revolution; revolutionary struggles in some places have encountered temporary setbacks; the political situation in some countries has taken a turn for the worse, etc.—all these will cause certain twists and turns in the revolutionary tide. However, none of these can stop the forward progress of the world's people's revolutionary movement. The vigorous development of the world's people's revolutionary movement remains the mainstream of the international situation.

    Twists and turns are not necessarily a bad thing. It is certainly better to have no twists and turns than to have them, but twists and turns can be transformed into good things. The path taken by the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is the best proof. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are regions where various contradictions in the contemporary world are concentrated. In particular, the contradictions between imperialism, old and new colonialism, led by the United States, and the people of various countries in this region are very sharp and complex. The twists and turns in the revolutionary struggles of the people of this region are also the most numerous. However, it is precisely through these twists and turns that the people have learned lessons, been tempered, further raised their awareness, and allowed the national liberation struggle to develop more deeply.

    The Congo (Leopoldville) is a good example. A few years ago, due to the attacks by imperialism and old and new colonialism, the betrayal of revisionists, and the lack of experience of the revolutionary forces, the Congolese people's struggle suffered serious setbacks. However, the Congolese people paid their tuition in blood, greatly raised their awareness, and the Congolese patriots took up arms and reignited the flames of revolution on their vast land. Having gone through a tortuous road, the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people today has advanced greatly compared to a few years ago.

    How should we deal with the twists and turns on the road of revolutionary progress? On this issue, the attitude of Marxists-Leninists and thorough revolutionaries is fundamentally opposed to that of opportunists and revisionists. Marxists-Leninists and thorough revolutionaries, when the revolution is developing smoothly, are not complacent but anticipate the possibility of twists and turns; when twists and turns appear, they do not panic, lose heart, or become pessimistic, but adopt correct strategies and tactics to persist in the revolution. Opportunists and revisionists, when the revolution encounters twists and turns, spread the idea of abandoning the revolution, even resorting to vicious curses against the revolution.

    After the defeat of the June Uprising of the Parisian proletariat in 1848, a chorus of curses against the "June Revolution" resounded throughout Europe. However, Marx gave the "June Uprising" extremely high praise, considering it "the first great battle between the two antagonistic classes of modern society."

    When the Russian Revolution of 1905 suffered a setback, the opportunist Plekhanov came out to accuse: "There was no need to resort to arms." However, Lenin retorted: On the contrary, it was necessary to carry out "unflinching and merciless armed struggle." Later, Lenin called the Russian Revolution of 1905 a dress rehearsal for the Great October Revolution.

    Today, modern revisionists, like those old opportunists, as long as the revolutionary struggle somewhere experiences a temporary twist or turn, they gleefully run out to peddle that set of garbage about abandoning the revolution, wanting people to believe that it seems that there should have been no revolution in the first place, and that the revolutionary struggle can only be abandoned. This is the typical face of a traitor.

    Let imperialism, reactionaries, and all traitors to the revolution rejoice. History will prove that when reactionary forces are very complacent and arrogant, it is also when they begin to be at a disadvantage and begin to be unlucky.

    "Don't you see the Yellow River's mighty power, flowing from the heavens afar?" The angry tide of world revolution is surging today, and although it will have to go through such or such twists and turns, it is just like the Yellow River's great current, rolling eastward, and no one can stop it!

    曲折和前进
    向东辉
    君不见黄河之势何壮哉，迢迢远从天上来。咆哮万里裂坤轴，盘涡倒卷声如雷。萦回九曲复东注，刊山湮谷沧溟开……
                                     ——《黄河歌》
    毛泽东同志说过：“革命的道路，同世界上一切事物活动的道路一样，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。”他又说过：“世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路”；“前途是光明的，道路是曲折的”。
    当代世界的伟大革命潮流，正是这样。看吧，它象浩浩荡荡的黄河一样，遇到高山峡谷，虽则“盘涡倒卷”，“萦回九曲”，却仍然以其雄壮的气势，一泻万里，奔腾向前。
    又曲折，又前进，这是辩证的统一，是革命发展的普遍规律。在革命发展的道路上，出现这样或那样的曲折，是不可能避免的。革命正是在曲折中不断前进的。
    为什么革命前进的道路上总要出现这样或那样的曲折呢？这是因为，革命是新生力量同腐朽力量之间无时无刻不在搏斗。有的时候由于力量对比暂时还不利于革命方面，有的时候由于革命领导的主观方面犯了这样或那样的错误等等，都会造成革命前进道路上的某种曲折。总之，新生事物的成长必然要经过反复的斗争。
    《矛盾论》告诉我们：“任何事物的内部都有其新旧两个方面的矛盾，形成为一系列的曲折的斗争。斗争的结果，新的方面由小变大，上升为支配的东西；旧的方面则由大变小，变成逐步归于灭亡的东西。”这就是说，不论是新生事物的上升过程，还是腐朽势力的下降过程，都是曲折的。新生力量只有同腐朽势力进行反复多次的斗争，才能够取得支配的地位。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点看问题，就会懂得：革命道路上出现曲折是不奇怪的；而不论这样的或那样的曲折，都不能改变革命前进的方向。
    当前国际形势是东风压倒西风。但这并不是说，在这样的大好形势之中就没有任何曲折。以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗进行疯狂的反扑；现代修正主义充当帝国主义和反动派的帮凶，破坏革命；有的地方的革命斗争遇到暂时的挫折；有的国家的政治局势发生逆转等等，这些都会造成革命潮流中的某些曲折。然而，所有这些都不能阻挡世界人民革命运动的前进。世界人民革命运动的蓬勃发展，仍然是国际形势的主流。
    曲折，并不仅仅只是坏事。没有曲折当然比有曲折好，但是曲折可以转化为好事。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放斗争所走的道路，就是最好的证明。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，是当代世界各种矛盾集中的地区。特别是以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义同这个地区各国人民之间的矛盾，是十分尖锐复杂的。这个地区的各国人民革命斗争中出现的曲折，也是最多的。然而，正是经过种种曲折，使人民得到了教训，得到了锻炼，使人民的觉悟得到进一步的提高，使民族解放斗争得到更深入的发展。
    刚果（利）是一个很好的例子。几年前，由于帝国主义和新老殖民主义的进攻，由于修正主义者的叛卖，由于革命力量还缺乏经验，刚果人民的斗争曾遭到严重的挫折。但是，刚果人民用鲜血付出了学费，大大地提高了自己的觉悟，刚果的爱国者拿起了武器，在辽阔的国土上，又重新燃起革命的火焰。经过了曲折的道路，今天刚果人民的革命斗争，比起几年以前是大大地前进了。
    应当怎样对待革命前进道路上的曲折呢？在这个问题上，马克思列宁主义者和彻底的革命派的态度，同机会主义者、修正主义者是根本对立的。马克思列宁主义者和彻底的革命派，在革命顺利发展的时候，不麻痹大意，而估计到出现曲折的可能性；在出现曲折的时候，不惊慌失措，消极悲观，而采取正确战略策略坚持革命。机会主义者、修正主义者在革命遇到曲折的时候，则散布取消革命的论调，以至对革命进行恶毒的咒骂。
    一八四八年，巴黎无产阶级六月起义失败之后，欧洲响起了一片“六月革命罪该万死”的咒骂声。但是，马克思给予“六月起义”以极高的评价，认为这是“现代社会中两大对立阶级间的第一次伟大战斗。”
    俄国一九○五年革命遭到挫折时，机会主义者普列汉诺夫出来指责说，“本来是不需要动用武器的”。可是，列宁驳斥说：恰恰相反，必须进行“毫不畏惧和毫不留情的武装斗争”。后来，列宁把一九○五年俄国革命称之为伟大十月革命的一次总演习。
    今天，现代修正主义者，也同那些老机会主义者一样，只要哪里的革命斗争出现了暂时的曲折，他们便兴高采烈地跑出来叫卖那一套取消革命的破烂货，要人们相信似乎本来就不该革命，似乎只能放弃革命斗争。这是典型的叛徒嘴脸。
    让帝国主义、反动派和一切革命的叛徒们去高兴吧。历史将会证明，当反动势力十分得意、十分嚣张的时候，也就是它们开始不利、开始倒霉的时候了。
    “君不见黄河之势何壮哉，迢迢远从天上来。”今日世界革命的怒潮汹涌澎湃，虽然还要经历这样的或那样的曲折，但是正如黄河巨流，滚滚向东，谁也不能阻挡！
