    Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and South Vietnam National Liberation Front Spokesmen Issue Statements
    Severely Condemning the U.S. for Instigating the Park Chung-hee Clique to Send More Cannon Fodder to Invade Vietnam
    Warning the South Korean Puppets that if They Deliberately Follow the U.S. Master, They Must Bear Responsibility for Their Criminal Actions
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 8 – The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 8th, strongly condemning the U.S. for sending two thousand more South Korean mercenary troops to South Vietnam.
    The statement pointed out that the recent criminal action of the Park Chung-hee clique, the running dogs of the U.S. in South Korea, in deciding to send twenty thousand more mercenary troops to South Vietnam is part of the U.S. plan to force its lackeys in Asia and Oceania to send mercenary troops to expand the war of aggression against South Vietnam. This decision by the Park Chung-hee clique further exposes it as a loyal servant of the U.S., using the blood of South Korean youth to exchange for U.S. dollars and serving the U.S. policy of aggression.
    The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns and accuses before world opinion this conspiracy and action of collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Park Chung-hee puppet clique. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely demands that they must immediately stop sending South Korean mercenary troops to South Vietnam; the U.S. government must stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, must withdraw all U.S. troops, South Korean mercenary troops, and other puppet troops, as well as their weapons and war equipment, from South Vietnam; must forever and unconditionally stop the bombing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The statement said that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome and sincerely thank the fraternal Korean people and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the sincere support they have given. The Vietnamese people earnestly call on the South Korean people to take even stronger actions to stop in time the criminal claws of U.S. imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique, and not to allow them to transport South Korean youth to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. aggressors.
    The statement finally solemnly warned the South Korean puppet government: if it deliberately follows the U.S. master and continues down the road of war of aggression against South Vietnam, it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat and must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its criminal war actions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 8 – The spokesman of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on March 6, severely condemning the Park Chung-hee clique's decision to send another twenty thousand South Korean mercenary troops to help expand the U.S. war of aggression against South Vietnam.
    The statement said: "Faced with isolation and the inevitable defeat in South Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists are frantically stepping up their extremely dangerous military adventure in Vietnam, deciding to send hundreds of thousands more U.S. and mercenary troops to South Vietnam, attempting to save the situation."
    The statement emphasized: "By deciding to send twenty thousand more troops to South Vietnam, the Park Chung-hee clique has openly gone further down the bloody and criminal road in South Vietnam. While taking hostile action against the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to save their country, this clique is also betraying the South Korean people, sending the sons of the South Korean people to die for the U.S. imperialist aggressors."
    The statement strongly condemned and denounced this action of the South Korean authorities and resolutely demanded that the Park Chung-hee clique abandon its policy of following U.S. imperialism, immediately cancel the decision to send more troops, and withdraw all South Korean troops from South Vietnam.
    The statement expressed confidence that the Korean people, who are actively struggling against the reactionary policies of the South Korean authorities, will actively prevent the Park Chung-hee clique from sending South Korean youth to South Vietnam to die for U.S. imperialism.
    The statement finally expressed the determination to strike the enemy even harder, annihilate more enemy troops, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressor troops and mercenary troops.

    越南外交部和南越民族解放阵线发言人分别发表声明
    严厉谴责美国唆使朴正熙集团再增派侵越炮灰
    警告南朝鲜傀儡如蓄意追随美国主子就必须对其罪恶行动承担责任
    新华社河内八日电  越南民主共和国外交部八日发表声明，强烈谴责美国增派两万名南朝鲜帮凶军到越南南方。
    声明指出，美国在南朝鲜的走狗朴正熙集团最近决定增派两万名帮凶军到越南南方的罪恶行动，是美国强迫它在亚洲和大洋洲的仆从派遣帮凶军来扩大侵略越南南方战争计划的一部分。朴正熙集团的这一决定，更加暴露了它是美国的忠实奴仆，它用南朝鲜青年的鲜血来换取美元，为美国的侵略政策效劳。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府向世界舆论强烈谴责和控诉美帝国主义和朴正熙傀儡集团的这种勾结阴谋和行动。越南民主共和国政府坚决要求它们必须立即停止增派南朝鲜帮凶军到越南南方；美国政府必须停止侵略越南南方的战争，必须把美国军队、南朝鲜帮凶军和其他仆从军队以及它们的武器和战争工具从越南南方全部撤走；必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动。
    声明说，越南人民热烈欢迎和衷心感谢兄弟的朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所给予的真诚的支持。越南人民恳切呼吁南朝鲜人民采取更加强有力的行动，及时制止美帝国主义和朴正熙集团的罪恶魔爪，不让它们把南朝鲜青年运到越南南方为美国侵略者充当炮灰。
    声明最后严正警告南朝鲜傀儡政府：如果它蓄意追随美国主子，继续在侵略越南南方的战争道路上走下去，它必将遭到可耻的失败，并且必须对由它的罪恶的战争行动所引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
    新华社河内八日电  越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发言人三月六日发表声明，严厉谴责朴正熙集团决定再派遣两万名南朝鲜仆从军去帮助扩大美国侵略越南南方的战争。
    声明说：“美帝国主义者面临孤立处境和他们在越南南方的不可避免的失败，正在疯狂地加紧在越南的极端危险的军事冒险，决定增派几十万美军和仆从军到越南南方，妄图挽救局势。”
    声明强调指出：“由于决定增派二万名军队到越南南方，朴正熙集团已公然在越南南方的血腥罪恶道路上走得更远了。这个集团在对越南人民的救国正义斗争采取敌对行动的同时，还出卖南朝鲜人民，派遣南朝鲜人民的子弟为美帝国主义侵略者送死。”
    声明强烈谴责和声讨南朝鲜当局的这种行动，并坚决要求朴正熙集团放弃追随美帝国主义的政策，立即取消增派军队的决定，从越南南方撤走全部南朝鲜军队。
    声明表示确信，为反对南朝鲜当局的反动政策而积极斗争的朝鲜人民将积极阻止朴正熙集团派南朝鲜青年到越南南方去为美帝国主义送死。
    声明最后表示决心更狠地打击敌人，歼灭更多的敌军，彻底击败美国侵略军和仆从国军队。
