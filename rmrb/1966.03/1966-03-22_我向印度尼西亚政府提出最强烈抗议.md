    The Right-Wing Reactionary Forces of Indonesia Organize Mobs to Attack My Consulate in Makassar Again
    I Lodge the Strongest Protest with the Indonesian Government
    This is another anti-China activity premeditated and planned by the right-wing reactionary forces. The responsible authorities of South Sulawesi Province have not fulfilled their promise to effectively ensure the safety of the Chinese Consulate, and even more so, they did not, at the request of our consulate, take effective measures to stop the attack by the mobs, which cannot but cause great regret and indignation.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 21st, lodging the strongest protest regarding the serious incident of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces organizing mobs to attack and destroy the Chinese Consulate in Makassar again on March 18th. The full text of the note is as follows: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and states the following regarding the serious incident of mobs attacking and destroying the Chinese Consulate in Makassar again:
    At approximately 9:00 a.m. on March 18, 1966, dozens of mobs organized by the right-wing reactionary forces of Indonesia forcibly broke into the inner courtyard of the Chinese Consulate in Makassar. While shouting "Kill the Chinese," they carried out violent destruction, seizing the national flag and national emblem of the consulate, raising the Indonesian flag on the consulate's flagpole, destroying the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, in the hall, pushing the consul's car outside and smashing it, and wantonly destroying the consulate's furniture. They also wrote "Indonesian University Students' Unified Action Organization" on the consulate's walls and cars. The entire atrocity lasted about twenty minutes.
    It is worth noting that the consulate was severely damaged by mobs on February 25th. The Chinese government solemnly put forward various demands in a note to the Indonesian government on February 27th, which have not yet been answered. During this period, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have intensified their clamor to "completely crush the Chinese Consulate" and have also carried out various slanders and fabrications. This attack and destruction of the consulate was launched the day after Consul Shi Jinkan came to Jakarta on official business. The facts show that this is another anti-China activity premeditated and planned by the right-wing reactionary forces, aimed at further undermining the relations between China and Indonesia. The responsible authorities of South Sulawesi Province also did not fulfill their promise to effectively ensure the safety of the Chinese Consulate, and even more so, they did not, at the request of the staff of the Chinese Consulate, take effective measures to stop the attack by the mobs. This cannot but cause great regret and indignation.
    The Chinese Embassy lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the above-mentioned serious incident. It demands that the Indonesian government immediately issue a public apology, immediately return the Chinese national flag and national emblem seized by the mobs, severely punish the instigators and perpetrators of the atrocities, compensate for all the losses of the Chinese Consulate in Makassar, and take practical and effective measures to ensure the safety of the Chinese Consulate and its personnel, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.
    With the highest respect.

### 我向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议

    印尼右派反动势力组织暴徒再次袭击我望加锡领事馆
    我向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议
    这是右派反动势力有预谋有计划的又一个反华活动。南苏拉威西省负责当局没有兑现切实保障中国领事馆安全的诺言，更没有应我领事馆要求，在暴徒袭击时采取有效措施加以制止，这不能不令人感到极大的遗憾和愤慨。
    新华社二十一日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十一日把一份照会交给印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒十八日又一次袭击和破坏中国驻望加锡领事馆的严重事件提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意，并就暴徒再次袭击和破坏中国驻望加锡领事馆的严重事件，申述如下：
    一九六六年三月十八日上午九时许，有几十名印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒，强行冲入中国驻望加锡领事馆的内院，一面高喊“杀死支那人”，一面进行猛烈的破坏，将领事馆的国旗、国徽劫走，在领事馆的旗杆上升起印度尼西亚的国旗，将厅内中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席的象毁坏，将领事的汽车推出门外砸烂，肆意捣毁领事馆的家具；还在领事馆的门墙上和汽车上涂写上“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动机构”字样。这次暴行前后历时约二十分钟。
    值得注意的是，该领事馆在二月二十五日曾遭到暴徒的严重破坏。中国政府在二月二十七日致印度尼西亚政府的照会中严正地提出了各项要求，至今未获答复。在这一段时间内，印度尼西亚右派反动势力反而变本加厉地叫嚣，要“彻底粉碎中国领事馆”，还进行了种种造谣诽谤。这次袭击破坏领事馆的暴行，又是乘师晋侃领事因公来雅加达的第二天发动的。事实表明，这是右派反动势力有预谋有计划的又一个反华活动，旨在进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系。南苏拉威西省的负责当局也并没有兑现切实保障中国领事馆安全的诺言，更没有应中国领事馆工作人员的要求，在暴徒进行袭击时采取有效措施加以制止。这不能不令人感到极大的遗憾和愤慨。
    中国大使馆就上述严重事件向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。要求印度尼西亚政府立即公开道歉，立即归还暴徒劫走的中国国旗和国徽，严惩暴行的主使人和肇事者，赔偿中国驻望加锡领事馆的一切损失，并采取切实有效的措施，保障中国领事馆及其人员的安全，并保证不再发生类似事件。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
      中华人民共和国驻
      印度尼西亚大使馆
