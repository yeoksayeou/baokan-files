    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 27th. The Albanian newspaper *Bashkimi* published an article on the 26th exposing the recent two-year cultural exchange agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States, stating that "The U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange agreement is part of the Khrushchev revisionists' general line of rapprochement with the imperialists." "Many facts show that the international gendarme of various countries—the United States—and the Khrushchev revisionists, the fifth column of U.S. imperialism, are closely aligning. This alignment is building bridges that some American presidents have always dreamed of. These bridges facilitate political, ideological, economic, and military infiltration into socialist countries, and the subversion and destruction of the fruits of revolutionary victory within these countries."
    The article then listed a series of agreements signed by the Khrushchev revisionists with U.S. imperialists under the guise of "joint action, safeguarding peace," and said, "All these agreements are beneficial to the United States' aggressive policies. Life has proven that any agreement between the 'two great powers' is a sharp knife inserted into the backs of the people of various countries."
    The article stated, "In the fields of culture, science, art, and literature, the purpose of the U.S.-Soviet agreements is always to first strike at Marxist-Leninist ideology, to degrade and corrupt socialist culture and art, to spread the American way of life among the working people, and to legalize espionage activities."
    The article pointed out, "All these bad things come from the general political line pursued by the Khrushchev revisionists today, from the pressure and infiltration of imperialist ideological toxins for which the Khrushchev revisionists have opened the door."
    The article concluded, "The new U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange agreement, like the agreements signed previously, serves one sole purpose: U.S. imperialism's global strategy against the socialist camp. On the eve of their congress, the Khrushchev revisionists want to declare to the people of various countries once again that they are determined to continue down the path of betrayal, the path of 'cooperation' and 'unity' with U.S. imperialism, the greatest enemy of mankind."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 23rd. The Albanian newspaper *Bashkimi* published a commentary on the 23rd exposing that the purpose of the recent visit to India by Petar Stambolić, President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, was to attempt to convene a summit conference of non-aligned nations to discuss the Vietnam issue in order to once again serve the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in Vietnam.
    The commentary, entitled "The Tito Group and Indian Reactionary Forces Are Plotting a New Conspiracy Against the Vietnamese People," pointed out that the Tito group and Indian reactionary forces had last year plotted to convene a conference of non-aligned nations to peddle Johnson's "peace talks" fraud. The Vietnamese people rightfully rejected this scheming with ulterior motives, while Johnson used this scheme to cover up his true intentions as an aggressor. Tito is now attempting to once again speculate on the peaceful aspirations of many countries in Asia and Africa. Because these countries hope that the Vietnam issue will be resolved fairly and reasonably, hope that the U.S. aggressors will get out of Vietnam, and hope that peace will be restored in Indochina as soon as possible.
    The commentary emphasized that just as the Johnson administration is constantly sending more U.S. troops and puppet troops to South Vietnam, just as the U.S. aggressors are brutally slaughtering thousands of innocent Vietnamese women, old people, and children, just as the U.S. aggressors are widely using poisons and asphyxiating gases to massacre people and destroy crops, just as the Johnson group is intensifying air raids on villages and cities in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and just as Washington is plotting evil plans to expand the war to the entire Indochina and Asia, the Tito group, colluding with the Indian reactionaries, is plotting this new conspiracy. This once again exposes the hideous faces of the traitorous Belgrade revisionist group and the Indian reactionaries. The commentary concluded: No matter how hard the Yugoslav revisionists, the Khrushchev revisionists, and their accomplices in Delhi try, no matter how enthusiastic they are in promoting Washington's criminal plan for "peace negotiations," they will never succeed.
    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana, an editorial published in *Zëri i Popullit* on the 20th pointed out that the U.S. imperialist and its lackeys’ aggressive plans against the peoples of Asian countries are supported and encouraged by the Khrushchev revisionists' policy of capitulation. When the purpose of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" became clear, when the Japanese militarists are playing an increasingly active role in the overall strategy of U.S. imperialism's aggression against the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other Asian countries, the Khrushchev revisionists are conducting various negotiations with the Japanese Sato government, which is acting as "a bridge" for Soviet-U.S. cooperation. The first meeting of the "Soviet-Japanese Economic Cooperation Committee" held in Tokyo also served this purpose.
    The article concluded that no matter how hard the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs try to divide the peoples of Asian countries and make Asians fight Asians, the anti-imperialist struggle of all revolutionary and freedom-loving forces on the Asian continent will surely thwart their attempts and crush their plans for aggression and enslavement.

    阿报谴责苏联领导人为帝国主义思想渗透敞开大门
    美苏协议为美帝国主义全球战略服务
    揭露铁托集团策划召开不结盟国家会议为美帝侵越效劳
    新华社地拉那二十七日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十六日发表文章，揭露苏联、美国最近签订的为期两年的文化交流协定说，“美国、苏联文化交流协定是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者同帝国主义者靠拢的总路线的组成部分。”“许多事实说明，各国人民的国际宪兵——美国和美帝国主义的第五纵队赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在紧密靠拢。这一靠拢正在为他们建立一些美国总统一直在梦寐以求的桥梁。通过这些桥梁实现对社会主义国家的政治、思想、经济和军事的渗透，并在这些国家的内部进行颠覆和破坏革命胜利的果实。”
    文章接着列举了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在“联合行动，维护和平”的幌子下，同美帝国主义者签订的一系列的协议后说，“所有这一切协议都有利于美国的侵略政策。生活已经证明，‘两大国’之间的任何协议都是插在各国人民背后的一把尖刀。”
    文章说，“在文化、科学、艺术和文学方面，美苏协定的目的总是在于首先打击马克思列宁主义的思想意识，使社会主义的文化和艺术堕落变质，在劳动人民中散布美国生活方式，使间谍活动合法化。”
    文章指出，“所有这一切坏东西都是来自赫鲁晓夫修正主义者今天奉行的政治总路线，来自赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为之敞开大门的帝国主义思想毒素的压力和渗透。”
    文章最后说，“新的美国、苏联文化交流协定象以前签订的协定一样，服务于一个唯一的目的：美帝国主义反对社会主义阵营的全球战略。在他们的代表大会前夕，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者想再次向各国人民声明，他们决心坚持走背叛的道路、坚持走同人类最大的敌人美帝国主义‘合作’与‘团结’的道路。”
    新华社地拉那二十三日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十三日发表评论揭露，南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会主席彼得·斯坦鲍利奇最近访问印度的目的是企图召开一次讨论越南问题的不结盟国家首脑会议，以便再次为美帝国主义在越南的侵略政策效劳。
    这篇题为《铁托集团和印度反动势力正在策划反对越南人民的新阴谋》的评论指出，铁托集团和印度反动势力去年曾经策划召开了一次不结盟国家会议，兜售约翰逊的“和谈”骗局。越南人民理所当然地拒绝了这种别有用心的图谋，而约翰逊却利用这种图谋来掩盖他这个侵略者的真正目的。铁托现在企图再次利用亚洲和非洲的许多国家的和平愿望进行投机。因为这些国家希望越南问题得到公平合理的解决，希望美国侵略者滚出越南，希望在印度支那尽快地恢复和平。
    评论强调说，正当约翰逊政府不断向南越增派更多的美国军队和傀儡军队，正当美国侵略者残暴地屠杀成千上万无辜的越南妇女、老人和儿童，正当美国侵略者广泛使用毒药和窒息性毒气来屠杀人民和毁坏庄稼，正当约翰逊集团加紧空袭越南民主共和国的村庄和城市，正当华盛顿策划罪恶的计划来把战争扩大到整个印度支那和亚洲的时候，铁托集团同印度反动派勾结在一起，策划了这个新的阴谋。这就再一次暴露了贝尔格莱德修正主义集团叛徒和印度反动派的凶恶嘴脸。评论最后指出：不管南斯拉夫修正主义者、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其德里的帮凶作出多么大的努力，不管他们多么热中于推行华盛顿“和平谈判”的罪恶计划，他们是决不会得逞的。
    据新华社地拉那电  《人民之声报》二十日发表的编辑部文章指出，美帝国主义及其仆从反对亚洲各国人民的侵略计划得到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者投降政策的支持和鼓励。当“日韩条约”的目的明朗化时，当日本军国主义者在美帝国主义侵略中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和亚洲其他各国人民的总战略中起着越来越积极的作用时，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在同充当苏美合作的“一个桥梁”的日本佐藤政府进行各种各样的谈判。在东京举行的“苏日经济合作委员会”第一次会议也是为这一目的服务的。
    文章最后说，不管美帝国主义者及其走狗如何努力企图分裂亚洲各国人民和使亚洲人打亚洲人，亚洲大陆所有革命的和爱好自由的力量的反帝斗争必将使他们的企图遭到破产，必将粉碎他们的侵略和奴役计划。
