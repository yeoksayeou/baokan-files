    Points out that the Polish government, under pressure from Soviet revisionists, fabricated incidents, expanding the ideological differences between the two parties into relations between states.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 1st. The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Polish Embassy in Albania on February 25, resolutely rejecting the Polish government's fabricated accusations against the Albanian Ambassador to Poland, and firmly protesting the unfriendly act of the Polish government in declaring the Albanian Ambassador persona non grata.
    The note said that the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Albanian Ambassador to Poland, Kojo Prifti, on February 23, claiming that materials printed in Albania against Poland had been distributed in various parts of Poland in 1964 and in recent weeks. The Albanian Embassy in Warsaw had given an Albanian passport to a Polish citizen. Therefore, the Polish government considered Ambassador Kojo Prifti's continued stay in Poland unwelcome.
    Ambassador Kojo Prifti immediately and rightfully rejected these groundless accusations and firmly protested this unfriendly act by the Polish government.
    The note said that the Albanian government resolutely rejects the baseless and deliberately fabricated accusations made by the Polish government against the Albanian Ambassador to Poland, Kojo Prifti. This intolerable behavior by the Polish government can only weaken the friendly relations between the Albanian and Polish peoples, and weaken the friendship for which Ambassador Kojo Prifti and the entire staff of the Albanian Embassy in Poland have worked actively and correctly. The Polish government must bear full responsibility for this.
    The note said that the Polish government is well aware that, as in the past, in recent weeks, the ambassador and staff of the Albanian Embassy in Warsaw have not interfered in Poland's internal affairs, let alone been involved in the so-called materials printed in Albania against Poland or the fabricated matter of "a Polish citizen holding an Albanian passport."
    The note said that after the Albanian Labor Party replied to the Polish United Workers' Party on February 11 regarding the issue of convening a meeting of the Warsaw Treaty member states and communist and workers' parties of Asian socialist countries on the issue of aid to Vietnam, the Polish government, under pressure from the Soviet revisionist government and some European socialist countries that had already recalled their ambassadors to Tirana, fabricated these incidents to force the Albanian government to take reciprocal measures, demanding the recall of the Polish ambassador to Tirana after the Polish government took rude and groundless actions against the Albanian ambassador to Warsaw. The Soviet revisionists' pressure on the Polish government has achieved its purpose, but this pressure has not and will never be able to harm the great friendship of the Albanian people and government for the fraternal Polish people.
    The note pointed out that the Polish government is expanding the ideological differences between the Albanian Labor Party and the Polish United Workers' Party into relations between states. But no one will believe the Polish government's slander against the Albanian Embassy in Poland and against the Albanian Ambassador to Poland. These accusations are clearly untenable and are deliberately fabricated by the Polish government to deceive Polish and world public opinion.
    The note concluded by saying that the Albanian government strongly rejects these malicious and absurd accusations and slanders, because it is on the basis of these accusations and slanders that the Polish government has declared Albanian Ambassador Kojo Prifti persona non grata and demanded that the People's Republic of Albania recall him. The Polish government must bear full responsibility for this serious and unjustified act. At the same time, the Albanian government is fully justified and has the right to consider the Polish Ambassador to Albania, Stanislaw Rogulski, persona non grata and demand that the People's Republic of Poland recall him.

    阿尔巴尼亚外交部照会波兰驻阿使馆
    断然拒绝波兰政府对阿使馆的诽谤  坚决抗议波兰政府要求召回阿大使
    指出波兰政府在苏联修正主义者的压力下，捏造事件，把两党之间意识形态方面的分歧扩大到国家与国家之间的关系中去
    新华社地拉那一日电  阿尔巴尼亚外交部二月二十五日把一份照会交给波兰驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆，断然拒绝波兰政府对阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使捏造的指责，并且坚决抗议波兰政府宣布阿尔巴尼亚大使为不受欢迎的人的不友好作法。
    照会说，波兰外交部二月二十三日通知阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使科乔·普里夫蒂，说什么在一九六四年和近几周来，在波兰各地散发了在阿尔巴尼亚印刷的反对波兰的材料，阿尔巴尼亚驻华沙大使馆曾经把一份阿尔巴尼亚的护照给了一名波兰公民，因此，波兰政府认为科乔·普里夫蒂大使留在波兰是不受欢迎的人。
    科乔·普里夫蒂大使当即理所当然地拒绝了这种无中生有的指责，并且坚决抗议波兰政府的这种不友好的作法。
    照会说，阿尔巴尼亚政府断然拒绝波兰政府对阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使科乔·普里夫蒂那些毫无根据和故意捏造的指责。波兰政府这种不能容忍的行为，只能削弱阿尔巴尼亚和波兰两国人民之间的友好关系，削弱科乔·普里夫蒂大使和阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使馆全体人员为之而积极和正确地工作的友谊。波兰政府对此必须承担全部责任。
    照会说，波兰政府十分清楚，如同过去一样，近几周来，阿尔巴尼亚驻华沙大使馆的大使和工作人员没有干涉过波兰的内政，更没有涉及到所谓在阿尔巴尼亚印刷的反对波兰的材料或所谓“一名波兰公民拿着阿尔巴尼亚的护照”的莫须有的事情。
    照会说，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党二月十一日就援助越南问题召开华沙条约成员国和亚洲社会主义国家共产党和工人党会议的问题复信给波兰统一工人党之后，波兰政府在苏联修正主义政府的压力下和已经召回驻地拉那大使的一些欧洲社会主义国家的压力下，捏造这些事件来迫使阿尔巴尼亚政府采取对等措施，在波兰政府对阿尔巴尼亚驻华沙大使采取粗暴和毫无根据的行为之后要求召回波兰驻地拉那的大使。苏联修正主义者对波兰政府的压力已经达到了目的，但是这种压力过去不能，将来也决不能损害阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府对兄弟的波兰人民的伟大友谊。
    照会指出，波兰政府正在把阿尔巴尼亚劳动党同波兰统一工人党之间的意识形态方面的分歧扩大到国家与国家之间的关系中去。但是任何人都不会相信波兰政府对阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使馆和对阿尔巴尼亚驻波兰大使的诽谤。这些指责显然都是站不住脚的，都是波兰政府为了欺骗波兰和世界舆论而故意捏造的。
    照会最后说，阿尔巴尼亚政府强烈拒绝这种恶意和荒谬的指责和诽谤，因为波兰政府是根据这些指责和诽谤把阿尔巴尼亚大使科乔·普里夫蒂作为不受欢迎的人而要求阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国予以召回。波兰政府必须对这种严重和无理的行径承担全部责任。同时，阿尔巴尼亚政府完全有理由和有权利认为，波兰驻阿尔巴尼亚大使斯坦尼斯瓦夫·罗古尔斯基是不受欢迎的人，并且要求波兰人民共和国予以召回。
