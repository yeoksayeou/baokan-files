    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 1st (Special Dispatch) -- The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an editorial on March 1st, on the anniversary of the Indochina People's Conference, stating that the united front of the Indochinese people will defeat US imperialism.

    The editorial said: The greatest strength of the Indochinese people lies in their fighting solidarity. The success of the 1965 Indochina People's Conference laid a solid foundation for developing the fighting solidarity between the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This is an inexhaustible source of strength for the three countries and a factor guaranteeing the final victory of their common struggle. Therefore, consolidating and continuously developing the fighting solidarity of the people of these countries in the struggle against the US imperialist aggressors is their urgent requirement and sincere desire.

    The editorial said that, as emphasized in the conference resolution, US imperialism is the most dangerous and most vicious enemy of the Indochinese people. In the past year, the US aggressors have become more brutal than ever before. They have committed one crime after another against the Indochinese people with utter shamelessness. However, they have met with the heroic resistance of the heroic Indochinese people and have received the punishment they deserve.

    The editorial went on to say that US imperialism and its running dogs are sparing no effort to sow discord among the Indochinese people, but the Indochinese people are more closely united than ever before in the struggle against the common enemy and are strengthening mutual support.

    The editorial emphasized that now US imperialism is attempting to expand the war to all regions of Indochina in order to salvage its complete defeat. Therefore, the people of all countries in Indochina need to strengthen their unity more urgently than ever before in order to thwart all the vicious conspiracies of US imperialism. Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk said in the Cambodian Parliament on February 14th that if forced by the enemy, Cambodia will not hesitate to form a common front with the Vietnamese people, the Laotian people, and the Thai people to resist the aggressors. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome this firm attitude.

    越《人民报》就印度支那人民会议一周年发表社论
    印度支那人民战斗团结必将挫败美帝
    新华社河内一日电  越南《人民报》三月一日就印度支那人民会议召开一周年发表社论说，印度支那人民的团结阵线将打败美帝国主义。
    社论说：印度支那人民最大的力量在于他们的战斗团结。一九六五年印度支那人民会议的成功，为发展越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民之间的战斗团结奠定了牢固的基础。这是三国人民取之不尽的力量源泉，是保证他们的共同斗争取得最后胜利的一个因素。因此，巩固和不断发展这些国家的人民在反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中的战斗团结，是他们的迫切要求和真诚愿望。
    社论说，正如会议决议所强调指出的，美帝国主义是印度支那人民最危险、最凶恶的敌人。美国侵略者在过去一年里变得比任何时候都更加残暴。他们极其无耻地对印度支那人民犯下了一个又一个的罪行。但是，他们遭到了英雄的印度支那人民的英勇抵抗，受到了应得的惩罚。
    社论接着说，美帝国主义及其走狗不遗余力地在印度支那人民中间制造不和，但是印度支那人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中，比以前更加紧密地团结，并且正加强相互之间的支持。
    社论强调指出，现在美帝国主义企图把战争扩大到印度支那的所有地区以挽救自己的彻底失败。因此，印度支那各国人民比以前更迫切需要加强团结以挫败美帝国主义的一切恶毒阴谋。柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二月十四日在柬埔寨议会中说，如果受到敌人的逼迫，柬埔寨将毫不犹豫地同越南人民、老挝人民和泰国人民组成抵抗侵略者的共同阵线，越南人民热烈欢迎这种坚定态度。
