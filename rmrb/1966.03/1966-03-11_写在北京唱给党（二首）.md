    Writing in Beijing, Singing to the Party (Two Poems)
    Liu Zhang, Goumenzi Commune, Xinglong County, Hebei Province

    I Want to Be Revolutionary Seed Stock
    I want to be revolutionary seed stock,
    Not learning from willow catkins, drifting with the wind,
    Rooted in the soil of the commune,
    Every leaf and branch facing the sun.
    I want to learn from pines and cypresses, standing tall in the snow,
    Not a "bonsai" growing in a warm room,
    Born to bloom red for the revolution,
    Dying to bear fragrant fruit for the revolution.
    Hoes turn over green waves, embroidering the mountains and rivers,
    Pens stir up waves, singing praises of the Party,
    Becoming a socialist peasant,
    Becoming a vanguard of the three great revolutions.
    The five continents, placed in my eyes;
    The four seas, surging in my chest,
    In order to realize the grand revolutionary plan,
    We must create a new path!

    Mountain Song is a Bullet, Pen is a Knife
    Chairman Mao's red banner is held high,
    Mountain song is a bullet, pen is a knife.
    Blackboard newspaper, radar station,
    Broadcasting microphone, bugle call,
    I am a militiaman on the literary front,
    Guarding the battle outpost.
    Where does capitalism attack from,
    That is where we will eliminate it.

    写在北京唱给党（二首）
    河北兴隆县沟门子公社  刘章做革命良种我要做颗革命良种，不学柳絮随风荡，扎根公社泥土里，叶叶枝枝都向阳。要学松柏雪中立，不做“盆景”暖室里长，生为革命开花红，死为革命结果香。锄翻绿浪绣山河，笔掀波涛歌唱党，做社会主义农民，当三大革命闯将。五大洲，眼中放；四海水，胸中荡，为了实现革命宏图，要把一条新路创！山歌是弹笔是刀毛主席红旗举得高，山歌是弹笔是刀。黑板报，雷达站，广播筒，冲锋号，我是文艺战线上的民兵，守卫在斗争的前哨。资本主义从哪里进攻，就在哪里把它消灭掉。
