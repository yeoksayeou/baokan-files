    Talking about the Utilization of Industrial Secondary Heat Energy
    Mu Delin
    The rational and economical use of coal occupies a very important position in China's socialist construction. The development of science and technology has opened up broad prospects for the use of coal. Coal is no longer merely a fuel for obtaining heat, but has become a valuable raw material in many industrial production sectors, especially in chemical process production. With the gradual expansion of China's industrial production, the consumption of coal for process production (such as chemical fertilizers, organic chemicals, and polymer chemistry) is also increasing.
    Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, tremendous changes have taken place in China's fuel balance. This change is first reflected in the increase in the amount of various types of fuels extracted, with particularly significant increases in the production of coal and oil, whose annual total output ranks among the top in the world. Secondly, great changes have also taken place in the quantity of fuel consumed and the way it is consumed (in terms of rational allocation and economical use). In order to further promote the needs of a new upsurge in industrial production in China's fuel balance, the development of the utilization of industrial secondary heat energy resources has very significant economic implications.
    Secondary heat energy, commonly known as "waste heat" or "residual heat," Primary heat energy is often aimed at process requirements, while secondary heat energy is based on saving fuel and improving the degree of heat utilization in production. In many enterprises, due to the wide use of secondary heat energy, heat efficiency has been greatly improved, product costs have been significantly reduced, and the balance of power within industrial enterprises has been promoted. It can be seen that the utilization of secondary heat energy is often a multi-faceted benefit for enterprises! The gains are considerable!
    At present, the main secondary heat energy resources of industrial enterprises include the following eight items:
    Combustible gas in process production This part of the combustible gas is usually a byproduct of the entire process production and contains various combustible chemical components. In most cases, it is mainly carbon monoxide with different concentrations (10% to 80%) and small amounts of hydrocarbons and hydrogen. For example, blast furnace gas in ironmaking production and coke oven gas in the coking process. Other examples include vertical furnace processes for cement, pig iron, nickel smelting, and copper smelting, converter processes for oxygen-enriched blowing and pure oxygen top blowing, as well as petroleum cracking and some chemical processes (such as yellow phosphorus), which can all produce a very large amount of combustible gas. It should be emphasized that combustible gas is often a process raw material gas in many cases, such as coke oven gas and pure oxygen top blowing converter waste gas, which can be used to process chemical fertilizers.
    High-temperature flue gas heat from industrial furnaces The flue gas temperature of industrial furnaces is usually much higher than that of power plant boiler units, which is very unreasonable. Of course, in a few cases, it is determined by its process characteristics and must be so, but in most cases, it is often the root cause of increased coal consumption and reduced unit thermal efficiency. In addition, there is also such high-temperature flue gas in certain smelting and chemical processes, which is not utilized at all, which is a pity.
    Waste materials in production There are often various types of waste materials in industrial and mining enterprises, such as coal preparation slag, gangue, coal dust, coke breeze, leftover wood, bagasse, grass, reed skin, leather scraps, black liquor from paper mills, and so on. Although the calorific value per unit of these combustibles is not high, and the moisture, ash, and sulfur content is very high, they should be actively and rationally utilized.
    Heat of formation in process reactions In smelting and chemical processes, chemical reactions often occur between a certain raw material and some elements, which may be oxidation, decomposition, or synthesis. Chemical reactions sometimes absorb heat and sometimes release heat. Therefore, correctly utilizing the heat in specific chemical reactions is often a powerful means of improving process thermal efficiency. For example, during the roasting of pyrite, the oxidation of pyrite with oxygen in the air to produce sulfur dioxide gas for sulfuric acid production is an exothermic reaction that can generate a lot of heat. Usually, the heat of one ton of pyrite can reach 1.4 million kilocalories, equivalent to a quarter of a ton of coal. Other processes such as ammonia synthesis and zinc concentrate roasting also have a large amount of chemical heat.
    Physical heat of process products In steel plants, molten steel is poured into ladles, and red-hot molten iron flows in casting channels. These heats should be utilized. The purpose of adopting continuous or semi-continuous rolling is to utilize the heat dissipation from one process to another. In addition, in coking plants, the red-hot metallurgical coke is often quenched with cold water, producing a white mushroom cloud that pierces the blue sky, and a huge amount of heat is lost. A dry quenching method should be actively adopted to utilize this heat.
    Cooling heat of production units In order to maintain the mechanical strength of various parts of the equipment at high temperatures, or to maintain the rigidity of the flame, high-temperature units often use imported cold water to absorb heat to achieve the purpose of cooling. The hot water coming out of the unit often flows into rivers and lakes and is lost. In recent years, the domestic method of evaporative cooling of production units has been gradually developed to generate steam from cooling heat for production or living needs. At the same time, since the heat absorption of water vaporization is ten to twenty times greater than the heat absorption of cooling water circulation temperature rise, water consumption is also reduced. In fact, high-temperature heat carrier evaporative cooling can also be used to generate higher pressure steam to produce electricity.
    Exhaust steam and condensate from production units Steam reciprocating pumps, steam hammers, and steam pressure machines are working machines often used in many production departments. The exhaust steam of these machines is often in a steam state. If the exhaust steam is condensed, each kilogram of steam will release 540 kilocalories of heat, and the generated condensate has a temperature of 70 to 100 degrees Celsius. These heats can be utilized.
    Heat dissipation of production units Many process equipment operate at temperatures higher than the atmospheric temperature. Heat dissipation of equipment is inevitable. In order to improve equipment thermal efficiency, insulation is essential. But even with insulation, there will still be losses. Therefore, diverting the heat dissipation of equipment and rationally arranging it can often replace the winter heating of the entire factory and neighboring places.
    Industrial secondary heat energy can be utilized in the following aspects: For the purpose of heat recovery in the process In utilizing any secondary heat energy resource, the first consideration should be: Can this heat be used for heat recovery in the process, such as preheating the furnace charge, materials, fuel, and air required for combustion, in order to improve the process temperature level, strengthen production, increase furnace output, and reduce costs. Practice has proved that the heat recovery utilization of the process is the most effective, and the maximum heat utilization limit is 60% of the total amount of secondary heat.
    For power production purposes Power production includes the production of steam and electricity. In order to obtain economical and rational utilization and effectively improve the thermal efficiency of the process, it is usually necessary to increase the initial steam parameters as much as possible and strive to adopt combined heat and power units, that is, back-pressure turbine units or extraction turbine units to achieve the purpose of both generating electricity and supplying heat.
    For heating and living purposes For heating, ventilation, domestic hot water, cooking and other small boilers. It must be stated that low-level secondary heat energy is actually available in many enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and actively utilize some low-temperature productive waste heat to reduce the fuel consumption of small stoves with very low thermal efficiency.

    谈谈工业二次热能的利用
    缪德林
    煤炭的合理与经济使用，在我国社会主义建设中占有十分重要地位。科学技术的发展为煤炭的用途开辟了广阔的前途，煤炭再不仅仅是一项单一性获取热量的燃料，而一跃成为许多工业生产部门特别是化学工艺生产中的一项宝贵原料。随着我国工业生产的逐步扩大，煤炭用于工艺生产（如化学肥料、有机化学、高分子化学）的消耗量也在日益增加。
    全国解放以来，我国的燃料平衡起了十分巨大的变化。这种变化，首先反映在各类燃料开采数量上的增长，其中特别显著的是煤炭与石油的产量，其年总产量已居世界前列。其次，在燃料消耗的数量和消耗的方式上（在合理分配与经济使用方面）也起了很大变化。为了使我国燃料平衡能够进一步促进新的工业生产高潮的需要，开展工业二次热能资源的利用具有十分重大的经济意义。
    二次热能，俗称“废热”，或“余热”。一次热能常常以工艺要求为目的，而二次热能则是以节约燃料，提高生产中热利用程度为前提。在许多企业中由于二次热能的广泛使用，热效率大大提高，产品成本大幅度的下降，并且促进了工业企业内部动力的平衡。由此可见，二次热能的利用对企业来说常是一箭数雕！得益非浅！
    目前，工业企业二次热能资源主要有以下八项。
    工艺生产中的可燃气体　这部分可燃气体通常是整个工艺生产中的副产物，含有各种可燃的化学成分，它在大多数场合主要是不同浓度（百分之十至百分之八十）的一氧化碳和少量的碳氢化合物与氢。例如，炼铁生产中的高炉煤气和焦化过程的炼焦煤气。其他如水泥、化铁、炼镍、炼铜的竖炉工艺过程，富氧吹炼与纯氧顶吹的转炉工艺过程，以及在石油裂化和部分化学工艺（如黄磷等）过程中，都可以产生为数十分庞大的可燃瓦斯。应当着重说明，可燃性气体在许多情况下又是一项工艺性原料气体，如炼焦煤气和纯氧顶吹转炉废气，都可用来加工为化学肥料。
    工业用炉的高温排烟热量　工业用炉的排烟温度通常远远高于电站锅炉机组的排烟温度，这是十分不合理的。当然，在少数场合，由其工艺特征所决定，不得不如此，但在大多数场合，它常常是导致耗煤增加、机组热效率降低的根本原因。此外，在某些冶炼与化工工艺中，同样存在有这种高温排烟，一无利用，实在可惜。
    生产中的废料　在工矿企业中常存有各种不同类型的废料，如选煤渣、矸子、煤屑、焦屑、残木料、蔗渣，草秫，苇皮、皮革残料、造纸厂的黑碱液，等等。虽然这些可燃物的单位发热值不高，而且其中水分、灰分、硫分含量很高，但是，应当积极地、合理地加以利用。
    工艺反应中的生成热　在冶炼与化学工艺中，常常是某种原料与一些元素间产生化学反应，它们可能是氧化、分解，也可能是合成。在化学反应中有时是吸热，也有时是放热。因此，正确地利用特定化学反应中的热量，往往是提高工艺热效率的有力手段。譬如，在硫铁矿焙烧的时候，硫铁矿与空气中氧的氧化生成二氧化硫气体制作硫酸，它是一个放热反应，可生成很高的热量。通常一吨硫铁矿的热量可达一百四十万大卡，相当于四分之一吨煤。其他如合成氨、锌精矿焙烧等都具有大量化学热。
    工艺产物的物理热量　在钢铁厂里，炽热的钢水注入盛钢桶中，赤热的铁水奔腾在铸槽里，这些热量都应加以利用。采用连续或半连续轧制，其用意之一就在于利用一个工序到某一个工序之间的散热量。此外，在焦化厂炽热的冶金焦常由冷水淋熄，产生一个白色的蘑菇云插入蔚蓝的天空，为数庞大的热量散失了，应该积极采用干熄法来利用这笔热量。
    生产机组的冷却热　高温机组为了维持设备各部件在高温状态的机械强度，或者保持火焰的刚度，常常用导入冷水吸取热量以达到冷却目的，从机组出来的热水往往流入江湖而散失了。近年来，国内已在逐步开展生产机组的蒸发冷却方法，以冷却热量产生蒸汽以供给生产或生活需要，同时，由于水的汽化吸热量比冷却水循环升温吸热量大十——二十倍，所以又减少了耗水量。其实，还可以采用高温载热体的蒸发冷却，以产生较高压力的蒸汽来生产电能。
    生产中的设备乏汽与凝结水　蒸汽往复泵、蒸汽锤、蒸汽压力机是许多生产部门常常采用的工作机械。这些机械的乏汽往往处在蒸汽状态，如果将乏汽冷凝，则每公斤汽将放出五百四十大卡热量，生成的凝结水又具有摄氏七十度至一百度的温度，这些热量都可以利用。
    生产机组的散热　很多工艺设备是在高于大气温度的操作情况下工作的，设备的散热是势所必然的，为了提高设备热效率，保温是必不可少的。但是即使保了温还是会有损失。因此，将设备的散热量导流，合理布局，常常可代替整个厂房与邻近场所的冬天取暖。
    工业二次热能，可以利用于以下几方面：用于工艺过程的回热目的　利用任何一项二次热能资源，首先应当考虑的是：可否将此项热量用于工艺过程的回热，如炉料、物料、燃料与燃烧所需空气的预热加热，以期达到提高工艺温度水平，强化生产，增加炉子出力，降低成本。实践证明，工艺过程的回热利用是最为有效的，其热量利用极限最大值为二次热量总量的百分之六十。
    用于动力生产目的　动力生产包括蒸汽与电力的生产，为了求得经济合理地利用，有效地提高过程的热效率，通常都尽可能地提高其蒸汽初参数，力求采用热电联合机组，即用背压式汽轮机组或抽汽式机组以达到既发了电、又供了热的目的。
    用于采暖与生活目的　用于采暖、通风、生活热水、炊事等小型锅炉。必须说明，低位能的二次热能实际上在许多企业都是具备的，为此，必须充分发动群众，积极地利用一些温度水平较低的生产性余热，以减少热效率十分低的小型炉灶的燃料消耗。
