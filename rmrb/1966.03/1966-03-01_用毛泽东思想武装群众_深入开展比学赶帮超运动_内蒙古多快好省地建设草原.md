    (Our dispatch) In recent months, a grassland construction movement centered on water conservancy construction has been vigorously unfolding in the vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia. Through the efforts of last winter and this spring, more than 4,100 new wells have been dug in pastoral areas. Together with the repair of old wells, spring tapping, pipeline water diversion, etc., a total of 14,800 square kilometers of water-deficient grassland have been opened up, doubling the amount in 1964. Through methods such as enclosure, irrigation, reseeding, fertilization, and pest (rodent) extermination, 12.67 million mu of grassland have been improved, 25% more than in 1964.

    Building grasslands is a fundamental plan for the construction of pastoral areas. How can we achieve faster, better, and more economical results? Leaders at all levels in Inner Mongolia emphasize that studying Chairman Mao's works should be put first, and cadres and herdsmen should be armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Last winter and this spring, leaders at all levels in Inner Mongolia organized herdsmen to study Chairman Mao's works, especially after studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Serve the People." The ideological consciousness of the herdsmen of all ethnic groups has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm and creativity in building grasslands have been further developed. Quele Changdeng, a poor herdsman from the Wujiagele Production Brigade of the Qinggele Commune in Alxa Left Banner, said, "I want to do three things with all my strength: first, resolutely take the socialist road; second, vigorously plant grass and trees; and third, control mountains and sand." This expresses the wishes of the vast number of herdsmen.

    On the Xilingol grassland, 38,900 people braved the biting wind and freezing cold to participate in the winter water conservancy construction movement. They used fire to thaw frozen soil, worked continuously after breaking ground, and rushed to draw water day and night after it emerged. Since last October, they have dug more than 470 tube wells. On the Ordos Plateau, herdsmen in Otog Banner used simple tools such as hammers, drills, shovels, and picks to dig 470 new wells in half a year, opening up 300,000 mu of water-deficient grassland, solving the grazing problem for 180,000 livestock. The water conservancy team of Alxa Left Banner, in cooperation with the herdsmen of various communes and brigades, in the water conservancy "restricted zone" where it was previously considered impossible to dig wells, used the spirit of ants gnawing bones, and with just a few picks and shovels, they painstakingly chiseled through the hard rock layer inch by inch, and dug three deep tube wells reaching 150 to 181 meters deep; at the same time, they also built five underground water diversion pipelines with a total length of dozens of kilometers from the foot of Helan Mountain to the water-deficient grassland, solving the drinking water problem for livestock moving to graze.

    In the upsurge of large-scale grassland construction, not only have some units with a better foundation achieved new achievements, but also a group of new advanced units have emerged in various grasslands, forming a mass movement of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, and helping each other. Wushenzhao Commune, known as the "Dazhai" of pastoral areas, after entering winter, organized its members to actively learn from Dazhai and other fraternal communes and brigades, extensively sought out shortcomings, and launched a production upsurge. At present, in addition to universally dredging and repairing old wells, it has also dug four large wells and installed diesel water pumps; planted more than 40,000 trees, planted more than 300 mu of sand willows, and planted 637 mu of windbreaks in the grain and forage base.

    Pastoral communes throughout the region are taking Wushenzhao as a model and are rapidly catching up. Since last October, 460 male and female members of the four brigades of the Happiness Road Commune in Bairin Right Banner have launched a struggle to develop and utilize the Talaboli River, and completed a seven-li-long water diversion canal in twenty days, shortening the original planned forty days by half. After this canal is equipped with a complete canal system, it will enable the Talaboli River to irrigate 5,000 mu of forage base and more than 10,000 mu of pasture in the Aorgae grassland according to people's wishes. Since the beginning of winter, the Gongbaolaga Commune of Taibus Banner in Xilingol League has dug 14 water wells, and 25 more are under construction, transporting 29,000 carts of fertilizer to 4,500 mu of grassland. The Wulange Rigge Brigade of the Wulanhada Commune in Chahar Right Rear Banner, in the spirit of doing what they learned, organized commune members to engage in well-digging work, and at the same time, leveled more than 110 mu of forage base. The female commune members of the Xilingole Commune in Bayannur League, with all the male commune members engaged in moving to graze, are vigorously engaged in leveling the forage base, and have now leveled 37 mu.

    用毛泽东思想武装群众　深入开展比学赶帮超运动
    内蒙古多快好省地建设草原
    本报讯　近几个月来，一个以兴修水利为中心的草原建设运动，正在内蒙古广大牧区蓬勃开展。经过去冬今春的努力，牧区已打成新井四千一百多眼，加上维修旧井、淘泉、管道引水等，共开辟缺水草场一万四千八百多平方公里，比一九六四年增加一倍；通过封育、灌溉、补插、施肥、灭虫（鼠）等办法，改良草原一千二百六十七万亩，比一九六四年多百分之二十五。
    建设草原是牧区建设的根本大计，如何才能做到多快好省？内蒙古的各级领导，强调要把学习毛主席著作放在首位，用毛泽东思想武装干部和牧民。去冬今春，内蒙古各级领导组织牧民大学毛主席著作，特别是学了《愚公移山》和《为人民服务》以后，各族牧民的思想觉悟大大提高，进一步发扬了建设草原的积极性、创造性。阿拉善左旗庆格勒公社乌嘉勒格生产大队的贫苦牧民却勒长登说“我要全力去做三件事：一是坚决走社会主义道路；二是大力种草植树；三是治山、治沙。”这道出了广大牧民的心愿。
    在锡林郭勒草原上，三万八千九百多人冒着刺骨的狂风和滴水成冰的酷寒，投入了冬修水利运动。他们用火烤开冻土，破土后连续作战，出水后昼夜抢水等办法，从去年十月以来，共打筒井四百七十多眼。在鄂尔多斯高原上，鄂托克旗的牧民用锤、钻、锹、镐等简单工具，在半年内打出新井四百七十眼，开辟缺水草场三十万亩，解决了十八万头牲畜的放牧问题。阿拉善左旗的水利队配合各个社队的牧民，在过去认为不可能打出井的水利“禁区”内，以蚂蚁啃骨头的精神，硬是凭着几把镐、锹，一寸一寸地凿透坚硬的岩层，打出了三眼深达一百五十到一百八十一米的深筒井；同时还从贺兰山麓到缺水草场，修了五道总长几十公里的地下引水管道，解决了牲畜移场放牧的饮水问题。
    在大搞草原建设高潮中，不仅是一些基础较好的单位取得了新的成就，而且在各类草原上都出现了一批新的先进单位，形成了一个比学赶帮超的群众运动。被誉为牧区“大寨”的乌审召公社，在入冬以后，组织社员积极向大寨和其他兄弟社队学习，大找差距，掀起生产高潮。目前除普遍淘修旧井外，又打了四眼大井，安上柴油抽水机；种树四万多株，栽沙柳三百多亩，栽粮料基地的风界子六百三十七亩。
    全区的牧区公社都以乌审召为样板，急起直追。巴林右旗幸福之路公社，从去年十月以来，四个大队的四百六十多名男女社员，展开了开发利用塔拉宝力格河的斗争，二十天内修成了一条七里多长的引水干渠，比原计划的四十天缩短一半时间。这条干渠配齐渠系以后，就能使塔拉宝力格河按照人们的意愿，灌溉敖尔盖草原的五千亩饲料基地和一万多亩牧场。锡林郭勒盟太仆寺旗贡宝拉嘎公社，入冬以来，已打出水井十四眼，正在打的还有二十五眼，向四千五百亩草场拉运肥料两万九千车。乌兰察布盟察右后旗乌兰哈达公社乌兰格日格大队，本着学了就干的精神，组织社员投入打井工作，同时，平整了一百一十多亩饲料基地。巴彦淖尔盟锡林高勒公社的女社员，在男社员全部投入移场放牧的情况下，大搞饲草饲料基地的平整工作，现已平整了三十七亩。
