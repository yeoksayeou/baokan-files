    Flowers of People's Friendship
    ——Welcoming the Visit and Performance of the Pakistan Cultural and Art Troupe to China
    Zhou Weizhi
    When hundreds of thousands of Pakistani people in Rawalpindi, the temporary capital of Pakistan, warmly welcomed our national leaders Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and other comrades with beautiful flowers, excited smiles, loud applause, moving folk songs and dances, and the slogan "Long Live China-Pakistan Friendship," Pakistani artists also came to China for a visit and performance, bringing the sincere friendship of 100 million Pakistani people to the Chinese people and a strong desire to continuously strengthen friendly exchanges. Our capital's artists warmly welcome these messengers of friendship and culture from afar. Especially for an art worker like me, who visited Pakistan in 1964, it is even more heartwarming to see the wonderful performances of Pakistani artists in 1965 and 1966, and I am very excited about their successful performances in the Chinese capital.
    China and Pakistan have had traditional friendship for one or two thousand years. The ancient "Silk Road" passed through the north of Lahore, and the academic and cultural exchanges between our two countries were even more frequent. This traditional friendship has had new development in the new historical period. China, Pakistan, and some other Asian countries have suffered from imperialist aggression for more than a century. The same fate connects us. We all have a strong desire to strengthen the solidarity of Asian and African countries, jointly resist imperialist aggression, resist foreign interference, safeguard national dignity, and adhere to the path of independence and self-reliance. We also have the urgent task of developing our independent national economies and promoting the excellent traditions of our national cultures, resisting Western economic aggression and cultural infiltration. Especially at present, in the struggle against the aggression of contemporary imperialism, the friendly solidarity between the Chinese and Pakistani people, and among the people of Asian and African countries, is even more important.
    The programs of the Pakistan Cultural and Art Troupe prominently feature songs and dances that express resistance to foreign aggression and the determination to defend the motherland. This shows the patriotic and combative spirit of the Pakistani people and artists. Their dance "Indigo Farmers" depicts the struggle of farmers in a village in Bengal (now in East Pakistan) two hundred years ago. In this village, people lived peacefully and happily. The rain clouds of the rainy season brought hope of a good harvest, and the farmers excitedly sowed rice seeds. Men and women farmers worked together joyfully. But the imperialists wearing indigo-colored tailcoats came. The invaders whipped them and forced them to grow indigo instead of rice. In this way, the colonialists could make huge profits, while the farmers faced starvation. Where there is oppression and exploitation, there is resistance and struggle. The farmers rose up in revolt against the imperialists and reactionary farm owners. This dance shows the revolutionary tradition of the hardworking and brave Pakistani people.
    The Pakistani folk instrument "Sarinda" solo performed a song very popular among the people, praising the Basun people for defending their motherland, defending their homes, and opposing aggression. Its rugged and powerful melody expresses the simple and strong character of the mountain people. The music has ups and downs, like narrating a heroic story. It leads us to the ancient years of battle. The profound feelings of struggle played from the firm strings are unforgettable.
    There are also some dances that praise patriotism and the life of soldiers, such as "Festival of Border Tribes" and "Sound of the Trumpet."
    Pakistani artists also expressed the love of the Pakistani people for the Chinese people and their love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and also expressed the common desire of the two peoples to unite against imperialism. This sentiment is very clearly expressed in the Chinese songs they sang. Two female singers sang three Chinese songs: "Unity is Strength," "The East is Red," and "Nanniwan." They sang them so affectionately and contagiously that the audience couldn't help but laugh along with the singing. This was the first time I heard a foreign female singer sing "Unity is Strength." She sang with strong emotion and clear rhythm, and people unconsciously tapped their feet to the beat of the song. After they finished singing, they were welcomed by the audience and had to sing it again in the warm applause.
    Expressing labor is a specialty of Pakistani folk dances, which is very worthy of our learning. The "Happy Fishermen" they performed is a very good program. Whether male or female actors are performing labor movements, they are both good-looking and so clear and full of national characteristics. For example, the dance movements of casting nets, collecting nets, catching fish, and carrying fish are not complicated, and sometimes only one or two typical movements clearly explain the story. The musical accompaniment is also well coordinated, and they show the same accuracy and appeal when expressing farmers' labor.
    Pakistani classical dances such as Kathak (Tap Dance) have a high degree of technique and rich expressiveness, with many rhythm changes, fast movements, and very even body shaking. The dance poses are even more varied and expressive. Some collective dances such as "New Jiasse Dance," the movements of the three people are very accurate, and they look very neat, like one person is performing. Without the usual hard practice, it is impossible to do so well.
    Other dances are also full of national characteristics, and the expression of various life situations and characters' emotions also have their own characteristics. The peacock dance shows a special humor.
    Pakistani folk songs and instrumental performances are very moving. Chinese audiences especially appreciate these musical programs. Some of these songs also express the feelings of working people, such as "Fishermen's Song," which depicts the scene of East Pakistani fishermen fishing and singing from morning to night on wide, intersecting rivers. The East Pakistani folk song "Cart Song" is also melodious in singing and fascinating in flute sound. The solo sound of "Alri Cha" is so familiar to me, which reminds me of the moving flute sound of "Alri Cha" I heard in Hyderabad when we visited Pakistan in 1964; it makes me recall many beautiful Pakistani cities, villages, rivers, mountains, and the 100 million hardworking and brave Pakistani people living, working, and fighting there; it also reminds me of the great encouragement given to us by the enthusiastic audiences when our Chinese art workers performed in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi, Hyderabad, Dhaka and other places in 1964. The warm reception of the Pakistani government and art groups and the sincere friendship of the Pakistani people are still unforgettable for us.
    China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors, and this friendship will continue to deepen with the progress of the times. Pakistani artists have visited China twice in a row in two years, which fully illustrates this point.
    Please Pakistani artist friends, bring the respect and love of 650 million Chinese people to the Pakistani people, the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Pakistani people. (Attached image)

    体现人民友谊的花朵
    ——欢迎巴基斯坦文化艺术团访华演出
    周巍峙
    当着巴基斯坦临时首都拉瓦尔品第几十万巴基斯坦群众用美丽的鲜花，兴奋的笑脸，响亮的掌声，动人的民间歌舞和“中巴人民友好万岁”的口号声热烈欢迎我们国家领导人刘少奇主席、陈毅副总理等同志时，巴基斯坦的艺术家们也来到中国进行访问演出，带来了一亿巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的真挚友情和不断加强友好往来的强烈愿望。我们首都的艺术工作者热忱地欢迎这些远道而来的巴基斯坦的友谊使者，文化使者。特别对我这个在一九六四年到过巴基斯坦的艺术工作者来说，能在一九六五年、一九六六年接连看到巴基斯坦艺术家们的精彩演出更感到亲切，对他们在中国首都进行的成功演出感到十分兴奋。
    中国与巴基斯坦在一两千年以前，就有着传统友谊，古代的“丝绸之路”就从拉合尔的北部经过，我们两国之间学术文化的交流更是频繁。这种传统友谊在新的历史时期又有新的发展。中国、巴基斯坦和一些其他亚洲国家在一百多年以来都遭受过帝国主义的侵略。同样的命运把我们联系在一起。我们都有加强亚非国家团结，共同反抗帝国主义侵略，抗拒外来干涉，维护民族尊严，坚持独立自主道路的强烈要求，也都有着发展自己独立的民族经济和发扬民族文化的优秀传统，抵御西方的经济侵略和文化渗透的迫切任务。特别是当前，在反对当代帝国主义的侵略斗争中，中国人民和巴基斯坦人民之间、亚非各国人民之间的友好团结就更加重要了。
    巴基斯坦文化艺术团的节目表现反抗外来侵略，表现保卫祖国决心的歌和舞占了比较突出的位置。这说明巴基斯坦人民和艺术家们热爱祖国、同仇敌忾的战斗精神。他们演出的舞蹈“种靛青的农民”就描写了在两百年前，在孟加拉一个村落里（它在现在的东巴）的农民斗争。在这个村落里，人民生活得平静而愉快，雨季的云彩给人们带来了丰收的希望，农民们兴奋地播上了稻种，男女农民在一起欣喜地劳动着。但是穿着靛青颜色的燕尾服的帝国主义者来了，侵略者拿着鞭子鞭打他们，强迫他们种植靛青，不让种稻米。这样，殖民者可以得到暴利，而农民们则面临着饥饿。那里有压迫，有剥削，那里就有反抗，就有斗争，农民们起来暴动了，反对帝国主义者和反动的农场主。这个舞表现了勤劳勇敢的巴基斯坦人民的革命传统。
    巴基斯坦西北地区民间乐器“沙林达”独奏，演奏了一首在人民中非常流行的歌颂巴逊人保卫祖国、保卫家乡、反对侵略的乐曲。它的粗犷有力的旋律，表现了山区人民的朴质健壮的性格，乐曲有抑有扬，象叙述着壮烈的故事。它把我们引到古老的战斗的年代里去，从那刚毅的琴弦上演奏出来的那种深邃的斗争感情，使人念念不忘。
    颂扬爱国主义精神和战士生活的舞蹈还有一些，如“边境部族的节日”、“喇叭之声”等。
    巴基斯坦艺术家还表现了巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的热爱，对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，也表现了两国人民之间团结反帝的共同愿望。这种心情在他们演唱的中国歌曲当中有很鲜明的表现。他们两位女歌唱家唱了《团结就是力量》、《东方红》和《南泥湾》等三首中国歌曲。他们唱得那么亲切，富有感染力，使观众们情不自禁地跟着歌声欢笑起来。外国女歌唱家独唱《团结就是力量》，我还是第一次听到。她唱时感情很健壮，节奏很清楚，也使人不自觉地按着歌曲的节奏轻轻地打起拍子来。她们唱完后都受到观众的欢迎，不得不在热烈的鼓掌声中再重唱一次。
    表现劳动是巴基斯坦民间舞蹈的特长，很值得我们学习。他们表演的“快乐的渔夫”，是一个很好的节目。无论男女演员在演劳动动作时，既好看，又那么明确和富有民族特色。如撒网、收网、捕鱼、扛鱼等等舞蹈动作，并不复杂，有时仅一、二个典型动作就交代清楚了。音乐伴奏也配合得好，他们表现农民劳动时也同样具有准确性和感染力。
    巴基斯坦古典舞蹈如卡塔克（踢跶舞）是具有高度的技术和丰富的表现力的，节奏变化多，动作快，身躯抖动时，十分均匀，舞姿更是多种多样，有丰富的表现力。有些集体性的舞蹈如“新加色舞”，三人的动作都很准确，看起来非常整齐，象一个人在表演。如果没有平常的刻苦练习，是做不到这样好的。
    其它有些舞蹈也都富有民族色彩，表现各种生活情景和人物感情也都各有其特点。孔雀舞更显示了特殊的风趣。
    巴基斯坦的民间歌曲和器乐演奏是非常动人的。中国观众对这些音乐节目也特别欣赏。这里有些曲子也表现了劳动人民的感情，如《渔民歌》就描绘了东巴渔民在宽广交叉的河流上从早到晚边捕鱼边歌唱的情景。东巴民歌《马车之歌》也是歌声悠扬，笛声迷人。“阿尔里柴”的独奏声，对我是这样的熟悉，使我想起在一九六四年我们访问巴基斯坦时，我在海德拉巴听过的“阿尔里柴”的动人笛声；使我回想起许多美丽的巴基斯坦城市、农村、河流、山地和在那儿生活着、劳动着、斗争着的一亿巴基斯坦勤劳勇敢的人民；还使我想起一九六四年我们中国艺术工作者在拉瓦尔品第、拉合尔、卡拉奇、海德拉巴、达卡等地演出时，热情的观众们给予我们的很大鼓舞的情景。而巴基斯坦政府和艺术团体对我们的热情接待，巴基斯坦人民对我们的诚挚情谊，更使我们至今难忘。
    中国和巴基斯坦是友好的邻邦，而且这种友谊随着时代的前进还会不断加深的。巴基斯坦艺术家在两年中接连访华两次，充分说明了这一点。
    请巴基斯坦艺术家朋友们把六亿五千万中国人民对巴基斯坦人民的尊敬和热爱，带给巴基斯坦人民，中国人民永远是巴基斯坦人民最可靠的朋友。（附图片）
