    Xinhua News Agency, 19th – The season for grafting jujube trees onto wild sour jujube rootstock is approaching. Many mountainous and semi-mountainous people's communes and production teams on the outskirts of Beijing are stepping up preparations, striving to graft the sour jujube trees better and faster, accelerate the greening of the capital, and develop woody grain production.
    In recent years, the outskirts of Beijing have carried out mass activities of grafting jujube trees onto wild sour jujube rootstock, and more than one million trees have been successfully grafted, with some jujube trees already bearing fruit. Experience has proven that grafting jujube trees onto wild sour jujube rootstock has many advantages: in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, sour jujube trees are found everywhere, providing an ample rootstock for large-scale grafting. The grafting technique is relatively simple and easy to master. The grafted jujube trees also bear fruit quickly. Many areas where trees were grafted three years ago now have trees that are one and a half meters tall. Last year, each tree generally bore fifty or sixty jujubes. Jujubes grafted onto sour jujube rootstock can basically maintain the quality and characteristics of the original jujube variety. Grafting saves labor and is less troublesome; it does not require digging pits or watering. The masses feel that the biggest advantage of grafting jujube trees onto sour jujube rootstock is the development of woody grain production.
    Since last winter, through summing up the experience of the masses, more and more cadres and commune members in the mountainous areas on the outskirts of the city have further realized that using wild sour jujube rootstock to graft jujube trees is a way to green the mountainous areas and develop woody grain production in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The broad masses are determined to vigorously promote this method this year, and have promptly surveyed the distribution of wild sour jujube rootstock, and are actively carrying out preparations such as trimming sour jujube trees and teaching grafting techniques. From last winter to now, Fangshan, Changping, Miyun, Pinggu and other counties alone have trimmed millions of sour jujube trees in preparation for grafting this spring. Relevant departments of the city and counties have held training classes, and more than 10,000 people have learned grafting techniques. Relevant departments in Beijing and counties (districts) with heavier grafting tasks have also organized technical service teams to go deep into communes and production teams to help with technical and material preparations. The scions needed for grafting this spring throughout the suburbs have been mostly secured through adjustments between communes and between counties. Beijing's agricultural and forestry departments have also purchased more than three million high-quality scions from Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong.
    After several years of practice, many areas on the outskirts of Beijing have accumulated relatively rich experience in grafting jujube trees onto wild sour jujube rootstock. In terms of grafting methods, many experienced farmers believe that in the spring, cleft grafting can be used first, followed by bark grafting, which has a higher survival rate, and then T-budding in the summer. Using these three methods alternately can extend the grafting time and fully utilize various rootstocks and scions. In order to improve the survival rate of grafted jujube trees, the grafting process must be quick, the scion must be well cut, the interface must be aligned, and it must be sealed and tied tightly. Special attention must be paid to strengthening management after successful grafting. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has twice organized more than 100 skilled technicians and experienced farmers to exchange grafting experiences, and has dispatched more than 30 experienced technicians to various counties on the outskirts of the city to provide technical guidance.

    加快首都绿化速度
    发展木本粮食生产
    京郊广大社员力争又多又快嫁接酸枣
    新华社十九日讯　利用野生酸枣棵嫁接大枣树的季节临近了，北京郊区许多山区、半山区的人民公社、生产队，正加紧进行各项准备工作，力争把酸枣嫁接得又多又好，加快首都绿化速度，发展木本粮食生产。
    京郊近几年来开展群众性酸枣棵嫁接大枣树的活动，已接活一百多万棵，有些枣树已经挂了枣。经验证明：利用野生酸枣棵嫁接大枣有许多好处：在山区、半山区酸枣棵到处都有，给大量嫁接准备了充足的母本，嫁接技术比较简便，容易掌握。嫁接的枣树结果也快。许多地区三年前嫁接的树，现在株高一米半，去年一般每棵树挂枣五六十个，利用酸枣棵嫁接的大枣，基本上可以保持大枣原品种的品质和特色；嫁接省工省事，不需要挖坑，也不需要浇水。群众感到用酸枣棵嫁接大枣树最大的优点是，发展木本粮食生产。
    从去年冬季以来，郊区山区通过总结群众经验，使越来越多的干部、社员进一步认识到，利用野生酸枣棵嫁接大枣树，是一项多快好省绿化山区、发展木本粮食生产的办法。广大群众决心今年大力推广这种办法，并且及时勘察了野生酸枣棵分布情况，积极进行整修酸枣棵、传授嫁接技术等准备工作。从去冬到现在，仅房山、昌平、密云、平谷等县，已经为今春嫁接整修好几百万株酸枣棵。市、县有关部门举办训练班，有一万多人学习了嫁接技术。北京市有关部门和嫁接任务较大的县（区），还组织了技术服务队，深入社、队，帮助进行技术和物质准备工作。全郊区今春嫁接所需要的接穗，经过社与社、县与县之间的调济，大部分已经落实。北京市农林部门还从河北、山西、山东选购了三百多万个优良的接穗。
    经过几年的实践，京郊许多地区对于利用野生酸枣棵嫁接大枣树积累了比较丰富的经验。在嫁接方法上，许多老农认为春季开始可先用劈接法嫁接，接着采取成活率较高的插皮接法，到夏季再用丁字形芽接法。这样三种方法交错使用，既可以延长嫁接时间，也可以充分利用各种砧木和接穗。为了提高嫁接枣树成活率，在嫁接时又要动作迅速，削好码子，对准接口，还要封好、绑好。接活后特别要注意加强管理。北京市农林局先后两次组织一百多名技术能手和老农交流了嫁接经验，并抽出三十多名有经验的技术人员分赴郊区各县进行技术辅导。
