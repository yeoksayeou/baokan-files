    Kathmandu, Xinhua News Agency, March 5 – Puspa Nripali, a member of the Nepalese Cultural Delegation, published an article in the *Emerging Nepal Daily* on March 5, praising the Chinese people for dedicating themselves to the great task of national development and construction with a master's attitude, and said that as Asians, they are proud of the great achievements of the Chinese people.
    Puspa Nripali visited China in 1965. In his article, "Impressions of Visiting China," he wrote: "Wherever we went, we felt that the Chinese people were working for the country, not for personal gain. In all walks of life, men and women enjoy complete equality." Everyone happily and resolutely completes the tasks assigned to them, and they have a sense of ownership in whatever they do. This is the reason why the Chinese people have been able to achieve great achievements in just sixteen years.
    The article stated that the cities and towns in China are very clean. Everywhere you can see new, tall, beautiful, and practical buildings. In the countryside, everywhere is a refreshing green. In Shanghai, we visited workers' families and were received with traditional Chinese hospitality.
    The article talked about China's culture and art: Chinese artists have developed a distinct Chinese form. There is a spirit of unity among the artists, and the success of the performances is due to collective effort.
    The article talked about China's education: Children and students, as future citizens, receive special care and attention. The children are physically strong. Chinese students not only study hard but also work hard. We saw many projects being done by the students themselves.

    尼泊尔文化代表团员撰文谈访华观感
    中国的成就使亚洲人感到骄傲
    新华社加德满都电  尼泊尔文化代表团团员普斯帕·尼帕利三月五日在《新兴的尼泊尔日报》发表文章，赞扬中国人民都是以主人翁的态度致力于国家发展和建设的伟大任务，并且说作为亚洲人对中国人民取得的巨大成就感到骄傲。
    普斯帕·尼帕利是在一九六五年访问中国的。他写的这篇访华观感说：“在我们所到之处，感到中国人民不是为了个人利益，而是为了国家而劳动。在各行各业中，男人和女人享有完全平等的地位。”大家愉快坚决地完成自己所分配到的任务，不论做什么工作，都有主人翁感。这就是中国人民之所以能够在短短的十六年内取得巨大成就的原因。
    文意说，中国大小城市都是非常整洁。到处可以看到新的高大、优美和实用的建筑物。在农村里，到处是一片令人心旷神怡的翠绿。在上海，我们访问了工人家庭，受到了中国传统的好客的接待。
    文章谈到中国的文化艺术时说：中国艺术家发展了一种鲜明的中国形式。在艺术家中间存在着团结精神，演出的成功归功于集体的努力。
    文章谈到中国的教育时说：儿童和学生作为未来的公民，受到特别的关怀和照顾。儿童们体格健壮。中国的学生不仅认真读书，并且认真劳动。我们看到许多工程是由学生自己干的。
