    A Grim Struggle
    ——On the Talk Drama "Inside and Outside the Counter"
    Chen Gang
    The Chengdu City Drama Troupe's recent performance of the talk drama "Inside and Outside the Counter" vividly reflects, through the artistic images on stage, the sharp struggle between two lines and two ideologies on the commercial front. It demonstrates the era's spirit of continuous revolution and continuous progress in socialist commerce, providing people with beneficial enlightenment.
    The commercial front is a part of our entire socialist cause. In the past, most of the plays we saw reflecting the lives of commercial workers focused on issues of service attitude and management style. Works like "Inside and Outside the Counter" that deeply reflect the class struggle on the commercial front are still rare.
    The main contradiction expressed in "Inside and Outside the Counter" is the struggle between the socialist management thought adhered to by Minister Ding and Zhao Changlin, and the capitalist management thought of Manager Xu. Surrounding this main thread, other contradictions are also intertwined: the opposition of shop employees to the sabotage activities of the bourgeois element Yang Lirong; the near deviation of the young shop assistant Wang Meidi under the corrosion of bourgeois thought; the contradiction between customers and the store; and the improvement of employee service attitude, etc. The struggle between the two roads and two ideologies existing within this state-owned department store tends to surface due to the presence of Old Ding, the Minister of Finance and Trade from the Municipal Party Committee, who is stationed there. Old Ding uses Mao Zedong Thought to take command, emphasizing highlighting politics and strengthening the work of the store's Party branch, mobilizing the masses with the viewpoint of class and class struggle. After a severe struggle, he helped Manager Xu and Wang Meidi correct their mistakes, exposed Yang Lirong's ugly face, and the entire store showed a new look, advancing along the socialist road and receiving the welcome of the masses.
    Here, the opposition to Manager Xu's capitalist thinking of neglecting politics and only caring about "making money," and the opposition to the sabotage activities of the bourgeois element Yang Lirong, are ultimately a struggle between two roads. This is a reflection of the proletarian struggle against the bourgeoisie on the commercial front during the socialist period. With sharp eyes, the playwright extracted such contradictory struggles from real life, constituting the basis of the dramatic conflict and unfolding a vivid and tortuous plot, thereby reflecting the face of class struggle in our real life relatively truthfully and deeply.
    The story of "Inside and Outside the Counter" vividly illustrates an irrefutable truth, which is what Chairman Mao often taught us: politics is the commander, politics is the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all economic work. In the early stage, under the leadership of Manager Xu, this store did not highlight politics, only cared about making money, and embarked on the evil path of serving a few, and bourgeois ideas spread and grew; later, the Party's leadership was strengthened, politics was highlighted, and it served production and construction and the broad masses, and proletarian ideas flourished. The two leadership ideologies and two results formed a sharp contrast. "The trees may prefer calm, but the wind will not cease." Class struggle is an objective law that does not depend on people's will. If you don't care about politics, politics will care about you. Therefore, highlighting politics or ignoring politics has become the focus of the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. The profound significance of this play lies in the fact that it tells people: no matter what work you do, at any time, you cannot separate from politics; if you do not highlight politics, bourgeois ideas will take advantage of the opportunity, the class enemy will have a chance, and it will cause damage to the revolutionary cause.
    The two characters of Old Ding and Manager Xu shaped in the play are worthy of attention.
    The author's description of Old Ding does not use many strokes, but in the important links of the development of the drama, it highlights certain characteristics of the character, leaving a deep impression on people. Old Ding appears in the posture of an ordinary worker. Yang Lirong mistakenly thought he was a "meat seller" and even lost her temper with him; and Hua Peishan, who was not at ease as a salesperson, frankly exposed her thoughts to him. He started to get involved in this struggle by understanding the real situation and grasping active thoughts. In this complex and difficult contradiction, Old Ding is good at using Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to arm the masses, mobilize the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, and organize everyone to fight resolutely against wrong ideas and behaviors. Especially the scene with Hua Peishan in the second act, the author quite prominently depicts Old Ding's political and ideological work, which is very vivid.
      It is very meaningful that "Inside and Outside the Counter" has created for us such a character as Manager Xu, who emphasizes business and neglects politics. He believes that "We are not a leading organ, but a store. As long as we complete the task, that is the greatest politics!" Under the control of this thought of "making money" as the goal, he does it if it is profitable, and does not do it if it is not profitable; he does it big if the profit is big, and does it small if the profit is small, competing for popular goods and disregarding national construction and the needs of the broad masses. At the same time, because he is in charge of leadership work and does not highlight politics, Yang Lirong's criminal activities appeared in the store, and the youth Wang Meidi was tempted by bourgeois ideas, causing serious consequences for a period of time. On the one hand, the author seriously criticized his shortcomings and mistakes: being divorced from politics, neglecting class struggle, a purely business viewpoint, not going deep into the lower levels, and a simple and rude style. On the other hand, he enthusiastically affirmed that he is a good comrade: he came from a shop assistant, suffered in the old society, worked actively, and lived a simple life, etc. In general, Manager Xu's character shaping is authentic and credible. Creating such a relatively complex character image is a problem that our drama creation is exploring. How to correctly reflect the internal contradictions of the people in socialist society, especially when it comes to the contradictions between the working people, we will encounter the problem of how to express class brothers with shortcomings and mistakes. At present, the experience of dramatic creation practice is still insufficient. If it is written insufficiently, it will lack strength; if it is written excessively, it will be untrue, which often directly affects the profound expression of the theme of the play. The playwright's description of Manager Xu is based on a revolutionary standpoint, with class feelings, and with a one-dividing-into-two viewpoint to look at him. Therefore, the audience has confidence in his transformation. Now people feel that the play's criticism of Manager Xu is not too heavy. On the contrary, it is felt that the manifestation of this thought of emphasizing business and neglecting politics in Manager Xu's character has not been explored deeply enough, and some of the descriptions are a bit too simple, and therefore still lack sufficient persuasiveness and soul-stirring artistic power.
    Compared with the two main characters, Minister Ding and Manager Xu, the other two positive characters in the play, Zhao Chenglin and Xu Fang, appear to lack brilliance.
    The comrades of the Chengdu City Drama Troupe went deep into the store life for more than half a year and produced such a good play, which is very welcome and worth celebrating. (Attached picture)

    一场严峻的斗争
    ——谈话剧《柜台内外》
    陈刚
    成都市话剧团最近演出的话剧《柜台内外》，通过舞台的艺术形象，生动地反映出商业战线上两条道路、两种思想的尖锐斗争，显示了社会主义商业不断革命、不断前进的时代风貌，给人们以有益的启发。
    商业战线是我们整个社会主义事业的一部分。过去我们看到的一些反映商业职工生活的剧本，大多是写服务态度和经营作风方面问题的，象《柜台内外》这样深入反映商业战线上阶级斗争的作品，还是不多见的。
    《柜台内外》所表现的主要矛盾是，以丁部长、赵长林为一方所坚持的社会主义经营思想，同徐经理的资本主义经营思想的斗争。在这一条主要线索的周围，还交织着其它一些矛盾：商店职工反对资产阶级分子杨丽容的破坏活动；青年店员王美娣在资产阶级思想腐蚀下险些走上歪道；顾客同商店的矛盾，以及职工改进服务态度等等。这座国营百货商店内部存在的两条道路、两种思想的斗争，由于市委财贸部长老丁来蹲点而趋向表面化。老丁用毛泽东思想挂帅，强调突出政治，加强商店党支部的工作，以阶级与阶级斗争观点发动群众。经过一场严峻的斗争，帮助徐经理、王美娣改正了错误，揭发了杨丽容的丑恶面目，整个商店出现了崭新的面貌，沿着社会主义道路大步前进，受到群众的欢迎。
    在这里，反对徐经理忽视政治、只顾“赚钱”的资本主义思想，反对资产阶级分子杨丽容的破坏活动，归根到底是一场两条道路的斗争。这是社会主义时期无产阶级同资产阶级斗争在商业战线上的反映。剧作者以锐利的目光，从现实生活中提炼出这样的矛盾斗争，构成戏剧冲突的基础，展开了生动曲折的故事情节，从而比较真实、比较深刻地反映出我们现实生活中阶级斗争的面貌。
    《柜台内外》的故事，生动地阐明了一个颠扑不破的真理，这就是毛主席经常教导我们的：政治是统帅，政治是灵魂，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。这座商店前期在徐经理的领导下，不突出政治，只顾赚钱，走上为少数人服务的邪路，资产阶级思想蔓延滋长；后期加强了党的领导，突出政治，为生产建设和广大群众服务，无产阶级思想就蓬勃发展。两种领导思想，两种结果，形成鲜明的对照。“树欲静而风不息”，阶级斗争是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。你不管政治，政治就要管你。因此，突出政治，还是忽视政治，成为无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想斗争的焦点。这个剧本的深刻意义就在于，它告诉人们：不论你做什么工作，在任何时候，都不能脱离政治；不突出政治，资产阶级思想就会乘虚而入，阶级敌人就有了可乘之机，就会给革命事业带来损害。
    剧中塑造的老丁和徐经理这两个人物是值得注意的。
    作者对于老丁的描写，用笔不很多，可是在戏剧发展的重要环节，突出了人物性格的某些特点，给人们留下了较深的印象。老丁是以普通劳动者的姿态出现的，杨丽容误以为他是
  “卖肉的”，还向他发了点脾气；而不安心做售货员的华佩珊毫不隐晦地向他暴露了思想。他就是从了解真实情况入手，从抓活思想开始卷入这场斗争的。在这场复杂困难的矛盾中，老丁善于用毛泽东思想和党的政策去武装群众，调动群众的革命积极性，组织大家一道去同错误的思想与行为展开坚决的斗争。尤其是第二幕同华佩珊的一段戏，作者相当突出地描写了老丁做人的政治思想工作，是非常生动的。
      《柜台内外》中为我们塑造了徐经理这样一个重业务轻政治的人物是很有意义的。他认为“我们不是领导机关，是商店，只要完成任务，就是最大的政治！”在这种以“赚钱”为目的的思想支配下，他有利就干，无利不干；利大就大干，利少就小干，争夺畅销商品，不顾国家建设和广大群众的需要。同时，由于他担负着领导工作而不突出政治，商店里就出现了杨丽容的罪恶活动，青年王美娣被资产阶级思想引诱，在一个时期造成严重的后果。作者一方面严肃地批评了他的缺点与错误：脱离政治、忽视阶级斗争，单纯业务观点，不深入下层，作风简单粗暴。另一方面又热情地肯定他是一个好同志：店员出身，在旧社会吃过苦，积极工作，生活朴素等等。从总的方面说，徐经理的性格塑造，是真实可信的，创造这样性格比较复杂的人物形象，是我们戏剧创作正在探索的一个问题。如何正确反映社会主义社会的人民内部矛盾，尤其是接触到劳动人民之间的矛盾，就要遇到如何表现有缺点、有错误的阶级兄弟的问题。目前戏剧创作实践的经验还是不够的，写的不足，便缺乏力量；写的过分，会不真实，这往往直接影响到剧本主题思想的深刻表达。剧作者对于徐经理的描写，是站在革命的立场上，带着阶级感情，用一分为二的观点去看待他的。因此使观众对于他的转变抱有信心。现在人们感到剧本对于徐经理的批评不是过重了，相反地，倒觉得这种重业务、轻政治的思想在徐经理性格上的表现，还发掘得不够深刻，某些地方的描写有点过于简单，因而还缺乏充分的说服力和动人心弦的艺术力量。
    和丁部长、徐经理这两个主要人物相比较，剧本另外两个正面人物赵成林、徐芳，就显得缺乏光彩了。
    成都市话剧团同志们深入商店生活半年多，搞出了这样一个好戏，是很值得欢迎和庆贺的。（附图片）

    老丁：老徐，你想一想，你这是为谁服务呢？
