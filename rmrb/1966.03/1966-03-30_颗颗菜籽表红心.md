    Each Rapeseed Represents a Red Heart
    Xiao Zhang
    It was very cold in the middle of the night. Song Shikui tossed and turned, unable to sleep soundly. His wife, awakened by him, scolded, "Look at you, treating rapeseed like treasure. You've never cared for the children like this."
    This wasn't an exaggeration. These days, Song Shikui had been focusing all his energy on the rapeseed. A batch of rapeseed was to be supplied for suburban production, and Song Shikui wanted to test the germination rate. At first, he placed the small flowerpot with the test rapeseed next to the stove, but the stove temperature was hard to control. Either the fire was too strong and dried out the seeds, or the fire went out and froze them. The weather was cold, and time was tight, so what to do? A highly responsible spirit inspired him to come up with a solution: he put the watered rapeseed in a small cloth bag, kept it in his inner clothing during the day, and in his warm bedding at night. After more than ten days, they sprouted as expected. Song Shikui was overjoyed. He forgot all his fatigue from the past few days and busied himself with testing other rapeseed.
    Song Shikui is a rapeseed custodian at the Beijing Agricultural Production Materials Management Office warehouse. He wasn't always like this when he started working. Back then, he simply received whatever goods came in, and delivered whatever goods were taken out, considering that his completed task. Once, the rapeseed supplied to the Wuluju Production Team in Haidian District grew only stems and no flowers, causing the production team to waste manpower and resources. Another time, the leek seeds supplied to the Xiaojing Production Team in Fengtai District resulted in more scallions than leeks in the leek field, causing dissatisfaction among the production team.
    These incidents once made him feel ashamed and sad. Song Shikui had been a shop assistant in a capitalist's rapeseed store since he was a child, and he had witnessed firsthand how capitalists often cheated farmers by selling inferior or fake products. Now that he was a rapeseed custodian for the people, he had made a series of mistakes in his work. How could he be worthy of the Party and the people? Especially after he understood that he was serving the people and doing revolutionary work, he resolved to listen to Chairman Mao's words and do his job well.
    There are hundreds of types of rapeseed in the warehouse, and they look almost the same in appearance and color. Not to mention anything else, just distinguishing them and preventing them from "mingling" is difficult. Song Shikui started here. Whenever rapeseed entered the warehouse, he checked each bag to see if the delivery note matched the rapeseed, and whether the rapeseed was new or old, and the moisture content. Then he used a comparative method to find the different characteristics between them, and put them in bottles, with the variety name written on the outside. For a period of time, he also frequently visited the vegetable market to observe the relationship between rapeseed and vegetables. Take Chinese cabbage, for example, there are seven types, such as Qingkou and Fanxinbai, but their seeds look the same. Radishes are divided into more than twenty types, such as Xinlimei and Ziyaqing, but their seeds are also the same. In order to accurately distinguish rapeseed, Song Shikui would lie on the table during lunch and evening breaks, drawing Chinese cabbage according to Chinese cabbage, and drawing winter melon according to winter melon. His wife, seeing him so fascinated with drawing all day long, said in bewilderment, "You've lived half your life and can't recognize a few characters, do you want to be a painter!" Little did she know that Song Shikui was using the "see-picture-recognize-seed" method to hang pictures on each rapeseed pile, so that people could understand it at a glance.
    As a rapeseed custodian, distinguishing and recognizing rapeseed clearly and preventing errors, it could be said that he had fulfilled his responsibility. However, Song Shikui was not satisfied with this. He was more concerned with whether these rapeseed would germinate and grow into vegetables after being supplied to the people's communes in the suburbs. So, he began to do germination experiments. The conditions were very poor at the beginning. There were no instruments, greenhouses, or warm frames. In the summer, he used flowerpots and boxes to germinate, and in the winter, he used the stove and his own body temperature to germinate. One summer, they bought a batch of rapeseed from another place, and the Haidian District Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought four catties at that time. Song Shikui counted out one hundred seeds for the flowerpot experiment. It was said that seedlings should emerge in three days, but only three seedlings emerged after seven or eight days, and no more than four or five in the second experiment. This showed that these rapeseed were unusable, so he immediately recovered the rapeseed, avoiding losses. Now the experimental conditions are different from the past. There are fully equipped experimental sites, and there are also people who specialize in conducting experiments, and it plays a greater role.
    In the past, there were these few sentences: "Leek seeds, sow this year's seeds next year, the rest cannot be used after a year, whoever feels sorry and insists on sowing will kill people with seedling reversion." June is the season for planting leeks again. Song Shikui saw that on the one hand, there was not enough leek seed, and on the other hand, the previous year's old leek seed was to be scrapped. Could this problem not be solved? Later, he heard that in some places in Baotou and Jilin, the leek seeds from the previous year germinated well when planted in the original place, and there was no seedling reversion phenomenon. He thought that Beijing's climate was hotter, and the leek seeds had less moisture and oil, which easily evaporated, the seeds were dry, and the germination rate would inevitably decrease. So, he put the leek seeds in a cold storage room with a temperature of several degrees below zero, and constantly researched and experimented at temperatures between minus five degrees and thirteen degrees. In the course of two years, how much effort did Song Shikui put in! He forgot fatigue, forgot rest, and finally the experiment was successful. They supplied the cold-stored, previous-year leek seeds to the production team. Later, Song Shikui rode his bicycle to the suburbs during his rest time to check. He saw the green leek seedlings and was extremely happy. He wrote this passage when he came back: "Leek seeds, sow this year's seeds next year, the rest can still be used after a year, cold storage and good keeping, summer storage and winter retrieval, sow next year."
    This bold new discovery aroused people's attention. The Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent someone to conduct research and summary. Many units, such as Beijing Agricultural University and Agricultural Technical School, also invited Song Shikui to introduce his experience. In 1964, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee awarded him the title of "Seed Custody Technician." Last year he became a political instructor. He often said to his comrades, we must fulfill our due responsibilities in ordinary jobs. We must learn as long as we live, and better master the knowledge of vegetable production.

    颗颗菜籽表红心
    萧璋
    半夜里，天气很冷。宋士奎翻来复去，老是睡不安稳。老婆被他惊醒了，责备他说：“看你，把菜籽当成宝贝了，对孩子也没有这么疼过。”
    这话说的一点也不过分。这些天来，宋士奎正把全副精神放在菜籽上。有一批菜籽要供应郊区生产，宋士奎想试验一下发芽率的好坏。开头，他把试验菜籽的小花盆放在火炉旁，火炉温度不好掌握，不是火旺把菜籽烤干，就是火灭了把菜籽冻坏。天气冷，时间紧，怎么办呢？高度负责的精神使他想出一个办法：用小布袋把浇过水的菜籽装起来，白天，放在贴肉的衣服里；晚上放在自己温暖的被窝里。十多天以后，它们果然都发出了芽。宋士奎一看乐坏了，忘记了这些天的劳累，又忙着试验其他的菜籽。
    宋士奎，是北京市农业生产资料经营处仓库菜籽保管员。他开始工作时，可不是这个样。那时是来什么货，收什么货；取什么货，付什么货，这就算完成任务。有一次，供应海淀区五路居生产队的菜花籽，光长秧不长花，害得生产队浪费了人力和物力。又一次，供应丰台区小井生产队的韭菜籽，韭菜地里葱多韭菜少，引起了生产队的不满。
    这些事曾经使他感到惭愧，也感到难过。宋士奎从小在资本家的菜籽店里当小伙计，亲眼看到资本家常常以次充好、以假充真，坑害农民。现在，自己是人民的菜籽保管员，工作中竟出现了一连串的差错，这怎么能对得起党和人民呢？特别是当他明白了自己是在为人民服务，是在做革命工作，他就下了决心，一定要听毛主席的话，把工作做好。
    仓库里的菜籽有上百种，样子、颜色都差不多。别的不说，光是把它们区别开、互相不“串门”，就是很困难的。宋士奎首先就从这里下手。每当菜籽入库的时候，他就一包一包地查看，进货单和菜籽是否相符，菜籽是新是陈，水分大小。接着他又用对比的方法，找它们之间不同的特征，并且用瓶子把它们装起来，外面写上品种名称。有一段时间，他还经常到菜市去转游，把菜籽和菜联系在一起来观察。拿大白菜来说吧，就有青口、翻心白七种，可是它们的籽却相同；萝卜又分心里美、紫芽青等二十来种，它们的籽也一样。为了准确地分清菜籽，中午、晚上一有空闲的时间，宋士奎就趴在桌子上照着白菜画白菜，照着冬瓜画冬瓜。他老婆见他整天这么着迷地画画，不解地说：“半辈子人了，斗大的字不认几升，难道想当画家吗！”她哪里知道宋士奎是通过
  “看图识籽”的方法，分别给每种菜籽垛上挂上了图画，让人们一看就明白了。
    作为一个菜籽保管员，区别、认识清楚了菜籽，不使它们发生错误，照理说，就算尽到了自己的责任。但是，宋士奎并不仅仅满足于这些，他更关心的是：这些菜籽供应郊区人民公社以后，能不能发出芽来，能不能长出菜来。于是，他就开始作起发芽试验了。开始条件很不好，没有仪器，也没有温室、阳畦，夏天，他就用花盆、箱子来发芽，冬天他又用火炉、自己的体温来发芽。有一年夏天，他们从外地买来了一批菜花籽，当时就被海淀区供销社买走四斤。宋士奎数出一百粒用花盆试验，按说三天应该出苗，可是等到七、八天才出了三棵，第二次试验也不过四、五棵。说明这些菜籽不能用，他马上把菜籽追了回来，避免了损失。现在试验的条件同过去不同了，有了设备齐全的试验场所，也有专门进行试验的人了，它所起的作用也更大了。
    过去，有这样几句话：“韭菜籽，今年打籽明年种，剩下隔年不能用，谁要心疼硬要下种，回苗死了把人坑。”六月，又是种韭菜的季节，宋士奎看到，一方面韭菜籽不够用，一方面隔年的陈韭菜籽却要报废，难道这个问题就不能解决吗？后来，他听说包头、吉林一些地方隔年的韭菜籽只要在原地种植发芽很好，也没回苗现象。他就想，北京气候较热，韭菜籽水分、油性少，容易蒸发，籽种干燥，发芽率必然会降低。就把韭菜籽放在零下几度的冷藏室里，在零下五度到十三度的气温下，不断地研究、试验。在两年的时间里，宋士奎花费了多少心血啊！他忘记了疲劳，忘记了休息，到底试验成功了，他们把冷藏的隔年韭菜籽供应了生产队。以后，宋士奎又在休息的时间骑着车子到郊区察看。他看到那绿油油的韭菜苗，心里高兴极了，回来他写了这样一段：“韭菜籽，今年打籽明年种，剩下隔年还能用，冷藏储存保管好，夏储冬取来年种。”
    这一大胆的新发现，引起了人们的重视。北京农业科学院曾派专人进行研究、总结。北京农业大学、农业技术学校等不少单位，还请宋士奎去介绍经验。一九六四年，北京市人民委员会授予他“种籽保管技术员”的称号。去年他当了政治指导员。他经常对同志们说，我们要在平凡的工作岗位上，尽到自己应尽的责任。要做到老、学到老，更好地掌握蔬菜生产的学问。
