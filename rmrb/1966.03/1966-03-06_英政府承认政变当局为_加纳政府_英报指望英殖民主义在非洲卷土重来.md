    According to Xinhua News Agency, London, March 5th: The British Labour government announced on the 4th that it recognizes the Ghanaian military coup group as the "Government of Ghana."
    It is known that Ghana severed diplomatic relations with Britain last December because Britain connived with the white colonialists in Southern Rhodesia to brazenly declare "independence." After the military coup in Ghana this time, the coup authorities immediately requested recognition from the British government.
    A statement issued by the British Commonwealth Relations Office on the 4th said that Britain had received a request from the Ghana "National Liberation Council," and "the British government has replied: They recognize the National Liberation Council as the Government of Ghana."
    At the same time, figures and newspapers of the British ruling class applauded the Ghanaian military coup, expressing hope that the coup could become an opportunity for British colonialism to make a comeback.
    British General Henry Alexander, former Chief of Staff of the Ghana Armed Forces, who was driven out by President Nkrumah in 1961, excitedly said on the day of the Ghanaian military coup that this day "is a great day." He also praised Kotoka, one of the ringleaders of the military coup, as an "excellent soldier."
    The Times published editorials on February 25th and March 2nd, gleefully saying that the military coup in Ghana "dealt a heavy blow to the militant African left wing," and if the coup group "wants help," "Ghana is worth saving again." It blatantly expressed the hope that the Ghanaian coup would become a "turning point" for African countries to abandon the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. A report in the newspaper on the 3rd also praised the coup as "an African revolution" and prayed that the regime of coup leader Ankrah "will last long."
    The Daily Express also published a commentary on February 25th, expressing its happiness about the Ghanaian military coup. It said: "Nkrumah's downfall can only improve British relations with Africa."
    The newspaper stated that Britain was very annoyed by Nkrumah's government's anti-imperialist stance. It said: "For Britain, since Nkrumah came to power, he has been a person who has made successive British governments feel very embarrassed. Because of his potential influence in Africa, Britain has found it increasingly difficult to call on moderate African public opinion to oppose extremists."
    The Daily Telegraph's editorial on March 2nd lavishly praised the military coup. It said: "Ankrah's assurance to African neighbors that Ghana will not engage in conspiracies against them is a welcome idea. He said this is turning a new page. It is also a good thing that the new government attaches importance to Commonwealth relations. There should be no practical obstacles to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Ghana and the United Kingdom."

    英政府承认政变当局为“加纳政府”
    英报指望英殖民主义在非洲卷土重来
    据新华社五日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党政府四日宣布承认加纳军事政变集团为“加纳政府”。
    人们知道，由于英国纵容南罗得西亚白人殖民主义者悍然宣布“独立”，加纳曾经在去年十二月同英国断绝了外交关系。这次加纳发生军事政变以后，政变当局立即请求英国政府给予承认。
    英国联邦关系部四日发表的一项声明说，英国收到加纳“全国解放委员会”的请求，“英国政府已答复：他们承认全国解放委员会是加纳政府”。
    与此同时，英国统治集团的人物和报刊对加纳军事政变拍手叫好，表示希望政变能成为英国殖民主义卷土重来的一个机会。
    一九六一年被恩克鲁玛总统赶走的英国将军、前加纳国防军参谋长亨利·亚历山大在加纳军事政变的当天就兴高采烈地说，这一天“是个大好日子”。他还赞扬军事政变的一个头子科托卡是“优秀的军人”。
    《泰晤士报》在二月二十五日和三月二日先后发表社论，喜形于色地说，加纳的军事政变使“好战的非洲左翼受到了沉重的打击”，如果政变集团“希望帮助”，“加纳将是值得再次挽救的”。它露骨地表示希望加纳政变会成为非洲国家放弃反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的“转折点”。这家报纸三日的一篇报道还赞扬政变“是一次非洲革命”，并且祈祷政变头子安克拉的政权“会长久保持下去”。
    《每日快报》二月二十五日也发表评论，对加纳军事政变表示高兴。它说：“恩克鲁玛的下台只会改善英国同非洲的关系”。
    这家报纸表示，英国对恩克鲁玛政府反对帝国主义的立场十分恼火。它说：“对英国来说，自从恩克鲁玛执政以来，他是使英国历届政府感到十分为难的一个人。因为他在非洲的潜在影响，英国已经发现越来越难以号召温和的非洲舆论来反对极端分子。”
    《每日电讯报》三月二日的社论大肆吹捧这次军事政变。它说：“安克拉向非洲邻国保证加纳不搞阴谋来对付它们，这是一个令人高兴的意见。他说这是翻开新的一页。新政府首脑还重视英联邦关系，这也是一件好事。加纳和联合王国恢复正常外交关系应当是没有实际障碍的。”
