    The experience of the Xinjiang Textile Factory in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement tells people:
    Material Incentives Lead to Misdirection, Production Goes Astray
    Political Leadership Brings Clear Direction, Production Flourishes
    (Our newspaper reports) The weaving workshop of the Xinjiang Textile Factory in Shanxi recently held a heated discussion on the question of "what should lead the increase production and practice economy movement." During the discussion, the workers summarized the lessons learned from the "two-fen [two cents] leadership" of April and May last year, believing that this year's increase production and practice economy movement must learn from this lesson and resolutely follow the path of political leadership.
      "Two-fen leadership" was a new over-production reward method formulated by this workshop in April and May last year because it failed to complete the planned output. It stipulated that weaving workers would receive an additional two fen of piece-rate reward for each meter of cotton cloth produced in excess of the plan.
    Last year, this workshop accepted a new production task from the state, requiring them to weave a new type of cotton cloth with relatively high precision. However, by the end of the first quarter, the qualified cotton cloth produced accounted for only a little more than 13 percent of the annual plan. The workshop leaders became anxious. When looking for the reasons for the failure to complete the plan, they found that a few workers, fearing that they would not receive bonuses if they weaved substandard cloth, simply shut down the loom when they saw problems in the cotton cloth, resulting in more downtime and a decrease in output. In order to encourage workers to operate the looms more and weave more cloth, the workshop leaders adopted the method of increasing the piece-rate rewards for workers, stipulating a reward of two fen for each meter of over-production. They originally thought that this method of material incentives would enable them to over fulfill the production tasks. However, the actual situation was the opposite. "Two-fen leadership" not only failed to solve the contradictions but instead fostered the idea among some workers of being calculating about personal gains and losses. The phenomenon of only caring about oneself and not the collective, only caring about quantity and ignoring quality, appeared. The qualification rate of cotton cloth was 70 percent in March but dropped to 60 percent in April and May. The increase in substandard cloth ultimately affected the output, which did not improve much. After the factory Party committee discovered this problem, it corrected the workshop's erroneous practice, cancelled the two-fen over-production reward method, strengthened political and ideological work, fully mobilized the workers, established the idea of weaving cloth for the revolution, adhered to the principle of quality first, and strived to complete the state plan. In June, the "two-fen leadership" method was cancelled, and the qualification rate of cloth rose to more than 80 percent, and the output also increased accordingly. By the end of the year, the state production plan for cotton cloth for the whole year was finally over fulfilled.
    This matter has passed. However, the factory Party committee believes that "two-fen leadership" is a reflection of capitalist ideology in the enterprise. The system cannot be abolished silently. Lessons must be learned from this matter, and the root of capitalist ideology must be eradicated. Therefore, in this year's increase production and practice economy movement, the workshop, in conjunction with summarizing last year's work, launched the masses to conduct a full discussion on this issue. The workshop leaders made self-criticisms to the workers, examined their mistakes in neglecting politics and implementing "money leadership," and severely criticized capitalist management ideas. They summarized the five harms of "two-fen leadership": First, it corrupts the workers' thinking, leading people to the capitalist evil path of simply pursuing output and competing for bonuses; second, it affects the unity among workers and weakens combat effectiveness; third, it cancels the principle of quality first and wastes state raw materials; fourth, it disrupts the production order; fifth, it affects the service life of the machines. During the discussion, veteran workers Wang Xuzu, Wu Shude, and others said, "What are we workers weaving cloth for? It is for the revolution, for building socialism, not for getting two more fen. 'Money leadership' can only lead workers to the wrong path." Through this discussion, cadres and workers have a clearer understanding that a socialist enterprise must have political leadership to achieve increase production and practice economy, and cannot rely on material incentives. With political leadership, both output and quality can leap forward.
    According to this spirit, when discussing this year's annual increase production and practice economy plan, the workshop leaders accepted the lessons of "two-fen leadership." They did not start by calculating numbers, nor did they first discuss technical measures. Instead, they started by grasping people's thinking, organizing workers to first study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, in order to mobilize the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative. On this basis, they then formulated the increase production and practice economy plan. Each worker used the "one divides into two" viewpoint to summarize their ideological progress and work experience last year, and also found their gaps in thinking and work. Then, activities to learn from advanced people and advanced ideas were launched to further establish the idea of everything for the revolution and wholeheartedly serving the people. The spiritual outlook of all the workers in the workshop has greatly changed. Zhang Caiyun, a weft-winding worker, spun a messy bobbin, which should have been counted as a defective product and deducted points. At first, she was afraid that the deduction would affect her bonus and the performance of the whole group, so she did not tell the inspector to register it. After returning home from work, she tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. She thought: This is not only concealing the bad bobbin, but also letting go of bad thoughts. She remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, and the more she thought about it, the less she could sleep. Finally, she made up her mind: I would rather fall behind in scores than fall behind in thinking. So, she put on her clothes and went to the factory, asking the inspector to register it as a defective product. The workshop held a branch committee meeting to study this matter, believing that this change in the workers' spiritual outlook is the most powerful guarantee for completing this year's increase production and practice economy tasks. Therefore, they seized this matter and vigorously promoted her conscious revolutionary spirit and serious and responsible spirit among all the workers, calling on all the workers to learn from her. This matter caused a great shock among the workers, promoting everyone's conscious revolution. The workers said in the discussion that defects are problems on yarn and cloth, but defects are first in the mind and then on the cloth, so the more you expose it, the less it will be, and the more you condone it, the more it will be. Now, more and more workers are reporting defective products and marking defects on the cloth themselves, and the quality of cotton cloth in the whole workshop is getting higher and higher. From January to recently this year, the qualification rate of cotton cloth in the whole factory reached more than 92 percent, and the first-class rate of products coming off the machines reached more than 82 percent, both exceeding the highest level of December last year.
    Recently, when implementing this year's increase production and practice economy plan in the workshop, because politics was emphasized and Chairman Mao's books were generally regarded as the highest instruction, "do whatever Chairman Mao said," many workers, by finding gaps from the ideological perspective and measures from the technical perspective, were determined to greet the motherland's magnificent Third Five-Year Plan with greater achievements. Finally, the increase production and practice economy plan that was drawn up was advanced in its indicators, practical in its measures, and emphasized politics.

### 物质刺激　迷失方向　生产走上邪路  政治挂帅　方向明确　生产蒸蒸日上

    新绛纺织厂增产节约运动中的经验告诉人们：
    物质刺激　迷失方向　生产走上邪路
    政治挂帅　方向明确　生产蒸蒸日上
    本报讯　山西新绛纺织厂织布车间最近在讨论开展增产节约运动的时候，围绕着“增产节约用什么挂帅”这个问题，展开了一番热烈的讨论。在讨论中间，职工们总结了去年四五月份“二分钱挂帅”的教训，认为今年的增产节约运动必须接受这个教训，坚决走政治挂帅的道路。
      “二分钱挂帅”，是去年四五月份这个车间因为完不成计划产量而制订的一个新的超产奖励办法，规定挡车工人的棉布产量每超产一米就可多得二分钱的计件奖励。
    去年，这个车间接受了国家一项新的生产任务，要他们织一种精密度比较高的新棉布。可是，到第一季度结束的时候，生产出来的合格棉布，还只占全年计划的百分之十三多。车间领导着了急，他们在寻找完不成计划的原因时，发现有少数工人因为怕织次布得不到奖金，一看到织的棉布上出了毛病，就干脆把布机关起来，以致造成停车时间多，产量下降。车间领导干部为了鼓励工人多开车，多织布，就采取提高工人计件奖励的办法，规定每超产一米奖励二分钱。他们原来以为采取了这个物质刺激办法，就可以超额完成生产任务。可是实际情况恰恰相反。“二分钱挂帅”不但没有解决矛盾，相反助长了一部分工人斤斤计较个人得失的思想，出现了只顾自己不顾集体，只管产量忽视质量的现象，棉布合格率三月份是百分之七十，四五月份下降到百分之六十。次布的增多最后影响了产量也没有什么提高。厂党委发现了这个问题以后，纠正了车间的错误作法，取消了二分钱的超产奖励办法，加强了政治思想工作，充分发动工人，树立为革命织布的思想，坚持好字当头，努力完成国家计划。六月份，“二分钱挂帅”的办法取消了，这个月布的合格率上升到百分之八十以上，产量也随之上升。到年底，终于超额完成了全年棉布的国家生产计划。
    这件事情过去了。但工厂党委认为，“二分钱挂帅”是资本主义思想在企业中的反映，不能不声不响地把制度废除就了事，一定要从这件事情中吸取教训，挖掉资本主义思想的祸根。因此，在今年的增产节约运动中，车间结合总结去年的工作，发动群众对这个问题进行了充分的讨论。车间领导干部向工人作了检讨，检查了自己忽视政治，实行“钞票挂帅”的错误作法，严肃批判了资本主义经营思想。他们总结了“二分钱挂帅”的五点害处：一，腐蚀工人的思想，它会把人们引到单纯追产量、争奖金的资本主义邪路上去；二，影响工人之间的团结，涣散战斗力；三，取消了好字当头，浪费国家原料；四，打乱了生产秩序；五，影响了机器寿命。在讨论中，老工人王续祖、武树德等都说：“我们工人织布为的啥？是为革命，是为建设社会主义，不是为多拿二分钱。‘钞票挂帅’只能把工人引到错误的道路上去。”经过这场讨论，使干部和职工更清楚地认识到：一个社会主义企业要达到增产节约，必须政治挂帅，而不能依靠物质刺激，政治挂了帅，就能产量质量双跃进。
    根据这个精神，他们在讨论今年全年增产节约计划的时候，车间领导接受了“二分钱挂帅”的教训，没有先去算数字，也没有先去讨论技术措施，而是从抓人的思想入手，组织工人先带着问题学习毛主席的著作，来调动工人的革命热情和生产积极性，在这个基础上再来拟订增产节约计划。每个工人都用“一分为二”的观点总结了自己去年思想上的进步和工作中的经验，同时也找到了自己思想和工作上的差距。接着，又开展了学习先进人物先进思想的活动，进一步树立了一切为革命、一心为人民的思想，全车间职工的精神面貌大大变样。络经挡车工张彩云，纺了一个乱线筒子，按说应该算作次品扣分。最初她怕扣分影响自己的奖金和全组的成绩，没有告诉检查工登记。下班回到家里，翻来复去睡不着，她想：这不仅是隐瞒了坏筒子，而且是放过了坏思想。她想起毛主席的教导，越想越睡不着，最后下了决心：宁肯在分数上落后，决不能在思想上落后。于是，她就穿衣起床进厂，要检查工给她按次品登记上。车间为这件事开了支委会研究，认为工人精神面貌的这种变化，是完成今年增产节约任务的最有力保证。于是就抓住这件事，在全体工人中大力宣扬她自觉的革命精神和严字当头的负责精神，号召全体工人向她学习。这件事情在工人中震动很大，促进了大家自觉革命。工人们在讨论中说，疵点是纱和布上的毛病，可是疵点先是在脑子里，后来才到布上的，所以自己越揭露它就越少，越迁就它就越多。现在，自报次品的工人和布面出了疵点自己划记号的工人越来越多了，全车间棉布的质量也越来越高。今年一月到最近，全厂棉布合格率达到百分之九十二以上，下机一等品率达到百分之八十二以上，都超过去年最高的十二月份的水平。
    最近，车间在落实今年增产节约计划的时候，由于突出了政治，普遍把毛主席的书当作最高指示，“毛主席是怎样说的就怎样做”，因此，许多工人通过从思想上找差距，从技术上找措施，决心用更大的成绩迎接祖国宏伟的第三个五年计划，最后订出的增产节约计划是指标先进，措施切实，突出了政治。
