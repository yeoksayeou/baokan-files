    The North Atlantic aggressive bloc controlled by U.S. imperialism is accelerating its disintegration and facing a serious crisis of division and collapse. The development process of the North Atlantic Group over the past seventeen years has been a process of increasingly developing contradictions within the imperialist camp and the growing decline of U.S. imperialism in Western Europe.

    On April 4, 1949, under the planning of the United States, the notorious "North Atlantic Treaty" was signed in Washington. Subsequently, according to the provisions of the "Treaty," the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," also known as the "North Atlantic Alliance," was established. The countries participating in this aggressive military group include the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, and others; in February 1952, Greece and Turkey joined successively, and in May 1955, West Germany also formally joined, making a total of fifteen countries. The "North Atlantic Treaty" is valid for twenty years. The headquarters of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" is located in Paris, and its highest authority is the Council, which holds meetings two to three times a year.

    For seventeen years since its establishment, all activities of the North Atlantic Group have been closely linked to U.S. imperialism's ambition to dominate the world. This organization plays a leading role among the imperialist's several aggressive blocs. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism tries to link it with other aggressive blocs; on the other hand, it uses this organization to control and enslave its member states politically, economically, and militarily, turning them into U.S. military bases and suppliers of manpower and materials, serving the U.S. policy of aggression and war. For seventeen years, the North Atlantic Group has done all kinds of evil. Under the manipulation of the United States, it has frantically expanded its armaments and prepared for war, creating international tensions, crudely interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and suppressing the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa. This group has also been used by the United States to actively support the West German militarist forces. By 1965, the entire North Atlantic Group had spent more than 900 billion U.S. dollars on expanding armaments and preparing for war.

    As the strength of Western European countries grows, the struggle between control and anti-control within this group intensifies, with the contradictions between the United States and France being the most prominent. As early as 1958, French President de Gaulle, who had just taken office, proposed to the United States and Britain the reorganization of the North Atlantic Alliance, the establishment of a "three-nation leadership core," and expressed that France should enjoy equal say in major international issues. Subsequently, at the Council meeting held in Athens in May 1962 to discuss the West Berlin and nuclear armaments issues, France opposed the tentative talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the Council meeting held in Paris in December 1962, the United States unilaterally announced the cessation of the production of "Lightning" missiles, pressuring Britain and France to abandon their plans to develop independent nuclear forces; and demanded that countries increase their conventional forces and strengthen the production of conventional weapons. However, Western European countries "reacted coldly" to the demands of the United States. At the Council meeting in May 1963, France openly opposed the "multilateral nuclear force" plan proposed by the United States, while Britain proposed the establishment of a "multinational nuclear force" that was still basically controlled by various countries to counter the U.S. plan. On June 22, 1963, on the eve of Kennedy's visit to Western Europe, the French government decided to withdraw its Atlantic fleet from the North Atlantic Group as a demonstration against U.S. control. By 1964, the contradictions between the United States and its Western European "allies" had become even more acute. Before the May Council meeting, France withdrew all its naval officers stationed in the North Atlantic Group; at the meeting, it once again demanded the reorganization of this group and accused the United States of its policy in Southeast Asia. At the Council meeting in December, the United States again peddled the "multilateral nuclear force" plan, demanding that member states increase their conventional armaments to serve the U.S. "flexible response strategy"; demanding that deputy foreign ministers of member states hold meetings every two or three months specifically to discuss the global situation, so as to drive the "allies" to serve U.S. aggressive actions around the world; demanding that "allies" provide "concrete help" to the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, and so on. All of these were met with opposition and cold treatment.

    In 1965, when the U.S. armed intervention in Dominica was strongly condemned by the people of the world and the war of aggression against Vietnam repeatedly suffered defeats, it became even more impatient to hope that the North Atlantic Group would contribute to its aggressive acts and wanted to drag its allies into the water. However, at the two Council meetings in May and December, the U.S. demands were either opposed or ignored.

    Recently, de Gaulle has put forward a greater challenge, formally proposing to withdraw from the North Atlantic military "integration" mechanism, and to take over the U.S. bases and troops stationed in France. This action has severely hit U.S. hegemony in Western Europe and plunged the North Atlantic Group into an unprecedented serious crisis. Although the United States is rushing around to salvage the situation, as the French newspaper *Combat* pointed out, "This diplomatic activity can only be counterproductive, and President Johnson knows this."

### 走向分崩离析的北大西洋集团

    走向分崩离析的北大西洋集团
    美帝国主义控制下的北大西洋侵略集团正在加速走向四分五裂，并且面临着分裂瓦解的严重危机。北大西洋集团成立十七年来的发展过程，也就是帝国主义阵营内部矛盾日益发展和美帝国主义在西欧日益衰落的过程。
    一九四九年四月四日，在美国的策划下，在华盛顿签订了臭名昭著的“北大西洋公约”。接着根据“公约”规定，成立了“北大西洋公约组织”，也称“北大西洋联盟”。参加这个侵略性军事集团的，有美国、英国、法国、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡、加拿大、挪威、冰岛、葡萄牙、意大利、丹麦等国；一九五二年二月，希腊和土耳其相继加入，一九五五年五月西德也正式加入；一共十五个国家。“北大西洋公约”有效期为二十年。“北大西洋公约组织”总部设在巴黎，其最高权力机构是理事会，每年举行会议二至三次。
    北大西洋集团成立十七年来，它的全部活动，都同美帝国主义争霸全世界的野心紧紧相联的。这个组织在帝国主义的几个侵略集团中起着主导作用。美帝国主义一方面力图使它同其它侵略集团联系起来，另一方面通过这个组织在政治、经济和军事上控制和奴役各成员国，使它们变成美国军事基地和人力物力的供应地，为美国的侵略政策和战争政策服务。十七年来，北大西洋集团干尽了坏事。在美国的操纵下，它疯狂地扩军备战，制造国际紧张局势，粗暴干涉别国内政，镇压亚非国家的民族解放运动。这个集团并被美国利用来积极扶植西德军国主义势力。到一九六五年为止，整个北大西洋集团用于扩军备战的费用已经达到了九千多亿美元。
    随着西欧各国实力的增长，这个集团内控制和反控制的斗争愈演愈烈，其中以美法矛盾为最突出。早在一九五八年，刚上台的法国总统戴高乐就向美英两国提出，要求改组北大西洋联盟，建立“三国领导核心”，并表示法国要在重大的国际问题上享有同等的发言权。接着，一九六二年五月在雅典举行的理事会会议上讨论西柏林和核武装问题时，法国表示反对美苏试探性会谈。一九六二年十二月在巴黎举行的理事会会议上，美国单方面宣布停止制造“闪电”导弹，压英法两国放弃发展独立核力量计划；要求各国增加常规部队和加强常规武器的生产。但是，西欧国家对美国的要求“反应冷淡”。在一九六三年五月的理事会会议上，法国公开表示反对美国提出的“多边核力量”计划，英国则提出建立基本上仍由各国控制的“多国核力量”来同美国的计划对抗。一九六三年六月二十二日，法国政府在肯尼迪访问西欧前夕，决定从北大西洋集团撤出它的大西洋舰队，作为反抗美国控制的一种示威。到一九六四年，美国同西欧“盟国”的矛盾更加尖锐了。在五月理事会会议前，法国撤出了驻北大西洋集团的全部海军军官；在会上则再次提出要求改组这个集团，并指责美国在东南亚的政策。在十二月的理事会会议上，美国又兜售“多边核力量”计划，要求成员国增加常规军备，为美国的“灵活反应战略”服务；要求各成员国副外长每两三个月举行一次会议专门讨论全球局势，以便驱使各“盟国”为美国在世界各地的侵略行动服务；要求“盟国”为美国侵略越南提供“具体帮助”，等等。所有这些都遭到了反对和冷遇。
    一九六五年当美国对多米尼加的武装干涉受到世界各国人民的强烈谴责，对越南的侵略战争连遭失败的时候，就更迫不及待地希望北大西洋集团为它的侵略行径出力，并且想拉它的盟国下水。但是，在五月和十二月的两次理事会会议上，美国的要求不是遭到反对，就是被漠然视之。
    最近，戴高乐提出了更大的挑战，正式提出退出北大西洋军事“一体化”机构，并要接管美国在法国的基地和驻军。这一行动沉重打击了美国的西欧霸权，并使北大西洋集团陷入了空前严重的危机。尽管美国急忙四出活动，力图挽回残局，但正象法国《战斗报》所指出的，“这种外交活动只能是事倍功半，约翰逊总统是知道这一点的。”　（荣久）（附图片）
