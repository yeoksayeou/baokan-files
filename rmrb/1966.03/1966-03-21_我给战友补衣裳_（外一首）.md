    I Mend Clothes for My Comrade (and another poem)
    Yang Yadu
  A thread, thin and long, my heart is tied to the thread; in battle, we share life and death, in construction, we shed sweat together. Tomorrow I will leave the company, I mend clothes for my comrade!
  A needle, white and bright, my gaze fixed on the needle's tip; in joy, we sing the same song, in difficulty, we help each other. Though I leave the company, my heart remains, I mend clothes for my comrade! The thread is thin, the needle bright, the stitches fly, busy and bustling, the cotton thread, shorter with each stitch, the comradeship, longer with each stitch; my heart follows the needle and thread, revolutionary friendship will never be forgotten!
    I Stand the Last Post
  Starry lights are inlaid in the sky, I stand the last post. My steps are light, my eyes are bright, I patrol everywhere in the dark night, I hold the gun tightly in my hand. Comrades and villagers are asleep, the harvested grain fills the granary, a great responsibility rests on my shoulders. Although I will leave the team tomorrow, I know how to stand guard tonight! The crescent moon hangs in the sky, I stand the last post. Tomorrow I will return home to demobilization, going to the forefront of agriculture, a soldier will open up a new battlefield. A red heart forever towards the Party, it's the same wherever I go, although I pick up a hoe, I haven't put down my gun, as long as the motherland calls, I am ready to rush to the front at any time!

    我给战友补衣裳（外一首）
    杨雅都
  一根线，细又长，心儿拴在线儿上；战斗中，我们同生死，建设中，齐把汗水淌。明天就要离连队，我给战友补衣裳！
  一根针，白又亮，眼神凝在针尖上；欢乐时，同唱一支歌，困难时，我们互帮忙。人离连队心不离，我给战友补衣裳！线儿细啊针儿亮，飞针走线忙又忙，棉线儿，越缝越短，战友情，越缝越长；心儿随着针线走，革命情谊永不忘！
    我站最后一班岗星光点点嵌天上，我站最后一班岗。脚步轻轻，眼睛明亮，在黑夜里四处巡视，我紧紧握住手中枪。战友和老乡已入睡，丰收的粮食堆满仓，重大的责任，担在我肩上。虽然明天就要离队，我知道今夜该怎样站岗！月牙儿挂在天空上，我站最后一班岗。明天复员，要回家乡，走上农业第一线，战士要去开辟新战场。一颗红心永向党，走到哪里都一样，虽然拿起锄，并未放下枪，只要祖国一声召唤，随时准备奔赴前方！
