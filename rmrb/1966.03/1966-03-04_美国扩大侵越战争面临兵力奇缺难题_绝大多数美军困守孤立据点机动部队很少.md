    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: American imperialism is facing a severe problem of troop shortage in its war of aggression against Vietnam. The vast majority of US-puppet troops are busy defending strongholds, and very few troops are available for maneuver. This situation was revealed in a recent report by the American "Washington Post".
    The "Washington Post" published a dispatch from Saigon by Cano on February 22, saying, "The allied forces (referring to the US-puppet clique and their accomplices) in Vietnam lack troops."
    Cano revealed that in the coming months, the US-puppet clique intends to continue bombing North Vietnam and continue to strengthen its war of aggression in South Vietnam. "But one problem facing planners here is whether the United States, South Vietnam, and other countries participating in this war effort can provide sufficient manpower for these plans."
    Cano revealed that the commander of the US forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, "hopes to have 400,000 US troops stationed in South Vietnam by the end of this year, and perhaps reach 600,000 before 1968."
    The dispatch said that some American officers in Saigon, while hoping for reinforcements, also felt this was very "dangerous" because "the manpower problem is closely related to the US strategy in Asia and other parts of the world." "The escalation of the US military will deeply trap the United States in a long-term and costly ground war in Asia" and "at the same time disrupt the balance of power in Europe."
    The dispatch said that the South Vietnamese puppet troops are also "severely short of manpower. As one American officer here said: 'They have scraped the bottom of the barrel, and now they are scraping the mud under the bottom of the barrel.'"
    The dispatch said, "Because of the lack of trained Vietnamese youth to ensure the security of the Da Nang area, approximately 40,000 US Marines are tied down in fixed defensive positions."
    Not long ago, US troops invaded An Lao Valley, but because there were no troops to defend it, "US troops withdrew, and the area became a place where the communists could re-infiltrate."
    Cano believes that an even more important problem encountered by the American aggressors is the lack of sufficient mobile forces to attack the people of South Vietnam. He calculated an account for the US-puppet troops and the accomplice armies, "The total strength is about 900,000, but their mobile forces are not much more than 100,000."
    Among the South Vietnamese puppet troops, "the main mobile forces are thirteen marine battalions and airborne troops. In addition, South Vietnam's ten infantry divisions can provide approximately 60,000 troops to launch offensives."
    The dispatch said: "It is estimated that among the more than 200,000 US troops here, approximately 30,000 can be used as strike forces. This does not mean that other troops do not participate in combat or are not attacked by enemy fire. However, it does mean that only a very small percentage of the US military can be quickly mobilized to strike the Viet Cong." "For example, all the Marines except four battalions are used to defend the Da Nang defensive circle. Of the three US divisions stationed here, approximately half are engaged in defensive missions."
    Due to the continuous increase in the number of casualties of US troops invading Vietnam and the increasing depletion of manpower, the US government has recently begun to recruit 900 male nurses and more athletes into the army.

### 美国扩大侵越战争面临兵力奇缺难题  绝大多数美军困守孤立据点机动部队很少

    美国扩大侵越战争面临兵力奇缺难题
    绝大多数美军困守孤立据点机动部队很少
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义在侵越战争中正面临兵力奇缺的严重问题，美伪军绝大多数忙于防守据点，能用于机动的部队很少。美国《华盛顿邮报》最近在一篇报道中透露了这个情况。
    《华盛顿邮报》二月二十二日刊登了卡诺从西贡发出的一则电讯说，“在越南的盟国
  （指美伪集团和它们的帮凶）兵力缺乏”。
    卡诺透露，在今后几个月里，美伪集团企图继续轰炸越南北方和继续加强在越南南方的侵略战争。“但是这里的计划人员面临的一个难题是：参加这种战争努力的美国、南越和其他国家能否为这些计划提供充分的人力”。
    卡诺透露，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰“希望到今年年底有四十万名美军进驻南越，也许到一九六八年以前将达到六十万人。”
    电讯说，在西贡的一些美国军官，一方面希望增兵，一方面又感到这是很“危险”的，因为“人力问题同美国在亚洲和世界其他地方的战略有密切联系。”“美军的升级会使美国深深陷进亚洲的一场长期的耗费巨大的地面战争”，“同时打乱在欧洲的力量平衡”。
    电讯说，南越伪军同样是“人力都奇缺。正如这里一个美国军官所说的：‘他们已经把桶底挖穿了，现在正在刮桶底下面的泥土。’”
    电讯说，“由于缺乏受过训练的越南青年保证岘港地区的安全，大约四万名美国海军陆战队被牵制在固定的防御阵地上。”
    不久前美军曾进犯安老谷，因为没有兵力据守，“美军撤出了，这个地区又成为共产党人可以重新渗入的地方。”
    卡诺认为：美国侵略者碰到的一个更重要的难题是没有足够的机动的部队来向南越人民进攻。他给美伪军以及帮凶军算了一笔账，“全部兵力约九十万人，但是他们的机动部队没有比十万人多多少。”
    在南越伪军中，“主要的机动部队是十三营海军陆战队和空运部队。此外，南越的十个步兵师能够提供大约六万人发动进攻。”
    电讯说：“估计在这里的二十万以上的美军中，大约三万人能够作突击部队。这并不是说，其他部队没有参加战斗或者不受到敌人的炮火的袭击。但是，这的确意味着，美军中只有很少的百分比能够迅速调动打击越共。”“例如，所有的海军陆战队除了四个营以外，全都用来守卫岘港防御圈。驻扎在这里的三师美军中，大约有一半担任防御任务。”
    由于侵越美军伤亡人数不断增加和兵源日益枯竭，美国政府最近开始征召九百名男护士和更多的体育运动员入伍。
