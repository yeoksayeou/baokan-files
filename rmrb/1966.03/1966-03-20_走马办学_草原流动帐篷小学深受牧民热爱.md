    Running Schools on Horseback
    ——Mobile Tent Elementary Schools Deeply Loved by Herdsmen
    Gansu Province Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County Bureau of Culture, Education and Health
    In 1953, under the leadership of the Party, four mobile tent elementary schools were established on the grasslands of Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County, Gansu Province, and it has been thirteen years now.
    Before liberation, due to the exploitation and enslavement by feudal lords and the slaughter and plunder by Kuomintang reactionaries, the Kazakh people could not live, let alone receive education in schools. At that time, not a single illiterate person could be found among the working Kazakh herdsmen of Aksai. After liberation, under the wise leadership and loving care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Aksai Kazakh people have a happy new life. In order to enable the Kazakh people to get rid of the backwardness of culture as soon as possible, four tent elementary schools were established in 1953 according to the requirements of the masses, with 95 children enrolled. Since then, the vast Aksai grassland has had its own schools for the first time in history.
    The Kazakh people in Aksai area have long been a nomadic people grazing along the water and grass, living a life of migrating in winter and summer and changing tents with the seasons. According to this situation, the tent elementary schools we run are also mobile. Wherever the herdsmen move to graze, the school moves there to conduct classes. Therefore, as soon as the tent elementary school was established, it was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of herdsmen.
    With the vigorous development of various productions in the autonomous county and the increasing improvement of people's lives, the broad masses of people have a more urgent need for learning culture. Under the leadership of the Party and with the care and support of all aspects of society, each tent elementary school has gradually expanded. By 1965, the number of students in the county's four mobile tent elementary schools had increased to 208, accounting for 75 percent of school-age children of ethnic minorities. In the past thirteen years, more than 150 students have graduated from tent elementary schools. Now, some are pursuing further studies at the Northwest Nationalities University and the county's ethnic junior high school, some have become people's teachers, some are working in state organs, and many have become the first generation of educated herdsmen.
      The Superiority Shown by Tent Elementary Schools
    The fact that mobile tent elementary schools in Aksai grassland have been established for thirteen years proves that this kind of tent elementary school is a school that adapts to the actual conditions of pastoral areas and meets the needs of herdsmen, and is a good form for popularizing primary education in pastoral areas. Its superiority has been demonstrated.
    Tent elementary schools adapt to the characteristics of nomadic life, facilitate schooling for herdsmen's children, are conducive to implementing the class line, and are conducive to popularizing primary education in pastoral areas. Tent elementary schools adapt to the mobile characteristics of pastoral areas. Each school has only two or three tents and no heavy equipment. They move with the herdsmen all year round. Wherever the herdsmen go to graze, the school follows to conduct classes. The teaching time is also arranged from the actual needs of the herdsmen, which facilitates the enrollment of herdsmen's children to a certain extent. According to our statistics last year, children of laboring herdsmen accounted for more than 85 percent of the students in the school.
    Tent elementary schools adapt to the characteristics of animal husbandry production, are conducive to combining with productive labor, and are a good form for implementing the Party's education policy and implementing semi-pastoral and semi-study programs. Tent elementary schools move with herdsmen all year round, and teachers and students do not leave the pasture and herds. At the same time, tent elementary schools have three or four months of summer and winter vacations and busy pastoral vacations every year, so teachers and students can participate in labor within their capabilities. In this way, students not only learn animal husbandry production techniques such as lambing, raising lambs, milking, mowing grass, shearing wool, and catching velvet, but also cultivate good qualities of loving labor, loving the collective, being diligent and thrifty from an early age. For more than ten years, tent elementary schools have not only trained qualified new students for higher-level schools, but more importantly, they have trained hundreds of good commune members with certain cultural knowledge who love labor and the collective economy.
    Tent elementary schools carry out flexible teaching activities according to the busy and slack seasons of animal husbandry production, which is conducive to the development of collective production. In recent years, tent elementary schools have taken a busy pastoral vacation during the busy season of lambing, which lasts for a month for the short ones and two months for the long ones. Teachers and students jointly participate in the commune's pastoral labor. Some small students participate in housework, which can liberate a large number of women and invest them in animal husbandry production. Last year, during the lambing period, the lambing time in Jianshe Township was advanced, so the Jianshe Township Elementary School took a busy pastoral vacation in advance. The labor force in Minzhu Township and Tuanjie Township was tight, and velvet shearing followed immediately after lambing, and the labor force could not be arranged. The Minzhu Township and Tuanjie Township Elementary Schools extended the vacation for one month (combining the summer vacation with the busy pastoral vacation). Some students grazed lamb flocks, and some students helped shear wool and catch velvet, and successfully completed the production tasks, which was praised by commune cadres and members.
    Adopting Diverse Forms from Actual Conditions
    Aksai area has a vast territory and very dispersed population, and the seasonal differences are large, and herdsmen move frequently. Within the county, the situations in Hartun and Annanba, the Qianshan grassland and the Haizi grassland are quite different. According to these different conditions and situations, although the county's four tent elementary schools all move with people and schools move wherever the herdsmen go, each school is run with its own characteristics, which are not exactly the same. Jianshe Township Elementary School and Heping Township Elementary School are located in Hartun and Annanba areas respectively. These places have abundant water and grass, and animal husbandry production is relatively stable. The grassland transfer is generally changed in two places a year, that is, one place in summer and one place in winter, and the time and route of grassland transfer are also relatively fixed. Therefore, these two schools have a semi-mobile nature. Minzhu Township Elementary School and Tuanjie Township Elementary School enter the Haizi grassland in winter, which is relatively stable during this period, but the flow is relatively frequent when the spring grass has just sprouted, and sometimes they have to move three or four times in a semester. Although there are only seventy or eighty households in a township, they operate more than 20,000 head of large and small livestock. Therefore, sometimes it is a work group, and a few tents are about tens of miles apart. In this case, the tent elementary school can only be set up in a relatively suitable place, and students who live far from the school will find it inconvenient to go to school. In order to adapt to this situation, some schools allow these students to eat and live in the school, and the commune helps the school solve their food and accommodation problems by recording work points; some schools arrange for students who are inconvenient to commute to live in the homes of commune members near the school.
    The arrangement of school opening and closing times also varies among the four tent elementary schools. Some extend the winter vacation and shorten the summer vacation; some extend the summer vacation and shorten the winter vacation; some only have one vacation a year (combining the summer vacation with the busy pastoral vacation). For example, Heping Township Elementary School is relatively stable. Each academic year has about nine months of classes and summer and winter vacations each time. During the busy season of lambing in April, there is a busy pastoral vacation. The length of the vacation and when to start school and take a vacation are determined according to the characteristics of animal husbandry production and the needs of the masses. The summer grassland transfer of Minzhu Township and Tuanjie Township Elementary Schools is frequent, and the teaching is unstable. They adopt the method of extending the summer vacation or the busy pastoral vacation and shortening the winter vacation or not taking a winter vacation; the climate in Hartun area is extremely cold, and the tent's cold protection equipment is poor, so Jianshe Township Elementary School adopts the method of extending the winter vacation and shortening the summer vacation. Although these methods are not convenient for school management, they adapt to the local actual conditions.
    Our arrangement of the curriculum and teaching content of tent elementary schools is also gradually understood clearly after continuous education by the Party and continuous exploration in practice. This is that it should be combined with the production characteristics of pastoral areas and the needs of people's lives, and attention should be paid to national characteristics. For the past thirteen years, tent elementary schools have used their own national language and writing for teaching, and mainly study the basic courses of Chinese and arithmetic well; each school also offers courses such as general knowledge, physical education, and music according to the actual situation. In 1960, according to the strong desire of the Kazakh people to learn Chinese, tent elementary schools added Chinese classes and equipped them with Chinese teachers. The Han teachers sent to the tent elementary schools conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of ​​serving the Kazakh people, actively learned ethnic languages, and used ethnic languages ​​to teach Chinese. They have achieved certain results in their work and have been welcomed by ethnic minority students, cadres, and masses.
    For more than ten years, tent elementary schools have proceeded from the actual needs of the masses' production and life. Whatever form the masses need to run, the schools are run in whatever form; whatever the masses need, the schools teach. They are adapted to local conditions and adapted to the times. They are deeply welcomed and praised by the herdsmen. Tent elementary schools have taken deep root in the hearts of the herdsmen. The herdsmen say: "Our own schools are good."
        Determined to be Cultural Sowers in Pastoral Areas
    We deeply realize that only by adhering to the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works can we implement the Party's education policy in practical work and insist on running schools well. Tent elementary schools have few teachers and many classes. Generally, each school has only two or three teachers, but each school has five or six classes, and the teaching tasks are heavy, and the environment and conditions are much simpler and more difficult than those of fixed elementary schools. However, the teachers of the tent elementary schools have worked tirelessly and diligently year after year on the grassland, following the herdsmen and herds, experiencing such and such difficulties, and working diligently, dedicating their youth and wisdom to the educational cause of the grassland. The key lies in that they listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In 1960, tent elementary schools added Chinese classes, and the Chinese teachers sent to tent elementary schools were all graduates from normal schools from other places. These Han youths, who had lived in cities and villages for a long time, were not accustomed to the life of ethnic minorities, and had never been exposed to ethnic minority languages. However, they came to tent elementary schools with full enthusiasm. At first, what they said was incomprehensible to the students, and what the students said was incomprehensible to them. In this case, coupled with the harsh local environment and the simple school conditions, some people wavered. However, Chairman Mao's works strengthened their idea of ​​serving the herdsmen. With the help of ethnic teachers, they taught themselves Kazakh and Kazakh writing, and now they can use ethnic languages ​​to teach Chinese. Similarly, most of the ethnic teachers are educated youths who graduated from ethnic colleges and returned to their hometowns. In 1960, tent elementary schools began to pilot the new Kazakh writing. None of the ethnic teachers had participated in the training of the new writing, but they quickly mastered the new writing writing and phonetic rules through self-study. Some teachers had a low level of mathematics, so they improved themselves with the help of Han teachers. All this fully shows that without establishing the idea of ​​serving the people, without a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, and being afraid of hardship and fatigue, it is impossible to do these things. Only people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can endure great hardships and hard work, overcome various difficulties with perseverance and tenacity, and sow the seeds of new socialist culture in the places most needed in pastoral areas.
    The Party's mass line is the fundamental line of all our work, and it is also the fundamental line for us to run tent elementary schools well. Not long after the establishment of tent elementary schools, some people opposed tent elementary schools, saying that "tent elementary schools do not look like schools" and "the quality is low," etc., but most of the masses strongly supported them. Before 1962, the tents used by tent elementary schools and the horses ridden by teachers for mobile teaching were all solved by relying on the masses. In recent years, the teaching aids and heating equipment required for the development and expansion of tent elementary schools, as well as the food and accommodation problems of some students who are inconvenient to commute, have also been solved by relying on the collective and relying on the masses. For more than ten years, countless facts have educated us that to run this kind of revolutionary school well, we must firmly follow the mass line, rely on the masses at all times, trust the masses, and clearly establish the view that everything is for the masses.

    走马办学
    ——草原流动帐篷小学深受牧民热爱
    甘肃省阿克塞哈萨克族自治县文教卫生局
    一九五三年，在党的领导下，甘肃省阿克塞哈萨克族自治县草原上建立起了四所流动的帐篷小学，到现在已经十三个年头了。
    解放前，由于封建主的剥削和奴役，国民党反动派的屠杀和掠夺，哈萨克族人民没法生活，更谈不到进学校受教育。那时，阿克塞哈萨克族劳苦牧民中，没有一个识字的人。解放后，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和亲切关怀下，阿克塞哈萨克族人民才有了幸福的新生活。为了使哈萨克族人民尽快地摆脱文化落后的状况，一九五三年，根据群众的要求，创办了四所帐篷小学，入学儿童九十五人。从此，辽阔的阿克塞草原上有史以来第一次有了自己的学校。
    阿克塞地区的哈萨克族人民，长久以来就是一个逐水草游牧的民族，长期过着冬夏迁移、寒暑易帐的生活。根据这种情况，我们办的帐篷小学也是流动的，牧民迁到那里放牧，学校就搬到那里上课。所以，帐篷小学一办起，就受到了广大牧民的热烈欢迎。
    随着自治县各项生产的蓬勃发展和人民生活的日益提高，广大人民群众对学习文化的要求更加迫切了，各帐篷小学在党的领导下，在社会各方面的关怀和支持下，逐步扩大。到一九六五年，全县四所流动帐篷小学在校学生已增加到二百零八人，占少数民族学龄儿童的百分之七十五。十三年来，帐篷小学毕业的学生有一百五十多人，现在，有的在西北民族学院和县民族初中深造，有的当了人民教师，有的在国家机关里工作，还有不少人成了第一代有文化的牧民。
      帐篷小学显示出的优越性
    阿克塞草原上的流动帐篷小学，创办十三年来的事实证明：这种帐篷小学是适应牧区实际状况、满足牧民要求的学校，是普及牧区小学教育的一种良好形式。已显示出它的优越性。
    帐篷小学适应游牧的特点，便于牧民子女上学，有利于贯彻阶级路线，有利于牧区小学教育的普及。帐篷小学适应牧区流动的特点，每校仅有两、三顶帐篷，没有笨重的设备，带着帐篷常年随牧民转移，牧民走到那里放牧，学校就跟到那里上课。在教学时间上，也都从牧民的实际需要出发，进行安排，这就在一定程度上便利了牧民子女入学。据我们去年的统计，在校学生中劳动牧民的子女占在校学生的百分之八十五以上。
    帐篷小学适应畜牧业生产的特点，有利于同生产劳动相结合，是贯彻党的教育方针、实行半牧半读的一种好形式。帐篷小学常年跟随牧民迁移，师生不脱离牧场和畜群，同时帐篷小学每年有三四个月的暑寒假、牧忙假，师生可以参加力所能及的劳动。这样，不仅学生学会了接羔育羔、挤奶、打草、剪毛、抓绒等畜牧业生产技术，而且使学生从小就养成了热爱劳动、热爱集体、勤俭朴素的优良品质。十多年来，帐篷小学不仅给高一级学校培养了合格新生，更重要的是培养了数以百计的有一定文化知识的、热爱劳动、热爱集体经济的好社员。
    帐篷小学根据牧业生产忙闲的情况，开展机动灵活的教学活动，有利于集体生产的发展。这些年来，帐篷小学都是一到接羔的牧业大忙季节就放牧忙假，短的一个月，长的两个月。师生共同参加公社的牧业劳动。一些小的学生参加家务劳动，就可以把大批妇女解脱出来投入牧业生产。去年接羔期间，建设乡产羔时间提前，建设乡小学便提前放牧忙假。民主乡、团结乡劳动力较紧，接羔后紧接着抓绒剪毛，劳动力安排不下来，民主乡、团结乡小学都延长了一个月的假期（将暑假与牧忙假合并），一部分学生放牧羔羊群，一部分学生帮助剪毛、抓绒，顺利地完成了生产任务，受到了公社干部和社员的称赞。
    从实际出发采取多种多样形式
    阿克塞地区土地辽阔，居住非常分散，而且季节的差别性大，牧民流动频繁。在县境内，哈尔吞和安南坝，前山草原和海子草原的情况是千差万别的。根据这些不同的条件和情况，全县四所帐篷小学虽都是人走校迁，牧民到那里，学校就到那里；但各学校又都办得各有特色，不尽相同。建设乡小学与和平乡小学分别设在哈尔吞和安南坝地区，这些地方水草丰美，牧业生产比较稳定，草场转移一年大抵换两个地方，即夏季换一个地方，冬季换一个地方，而且转移草场的时间和路线也是较固定的，所以这两个学校就带有半流动的性质。民主乡小学和团结乡小学冬季进入海子草原，这段时间较稳定，但每当春草刚刚萌芽时，流动就比较频繁，有时一学期要迁居三四次之多。一个乡虽仅有七八十户人家，但却经营着两万头以上的大小牲畜，所以有时就是一个作业组，几顶帐篷也相距约几十里。在这种情况下，帐篷小学只能设在一个比较适中的地方，距离学校远的学生就不便上学。为了适应这种情况，有的学校让这些学生在校食宿，公社用记工分的办法帮助学校解决他们的食宿问题；有的学校对不便走读的学生，就由公社安排在距离学校近的社员家里。
    在开学、放假的时间安排上，四所帐篷小学也不尽相同。有的延长寒假，缩短暑假；有的延长暑假，缩短寒假；有的一年只放一次假（暑假与牧忙假合并放）。如和平乡小学比较稳定，每学年上课约九个月，放寒暑假各一次，在四月份接羔牧忙季节，放牧忙假一次。假期的长短和什么时候开学、放假，都是根据牧业生产的特点和群众需要来确定。民主乡、团结乡小学，夏季草场转移次数频繁，教学不稳定，就采取延长暑假或牧忙假，缩短寒假或不放寒假的办法；哈尔吞地区气候酷寒，帐篷防寒设备较差，建设乡小学便采取延长寒假、缩短暑假的办法。这些办法虽不便于学校管理，但它却适应当地的实际情况。
    我们对帐篷小学的课程设置和教学内容的安排，也是经过党的不断教育和在实践中不断摸索，才逐渐认识明确的，这就是应该结合牧区的生产特点和人民生活的需要，并且注意民族特点。十三年来，帐篷小学采用本民族语言文字进行教学，主要学好语文和算术基础课；各校按实际情况还开设常识、体育、音乐等课。一九六○年，帐篷小学根据哈萨克群众对学习汉语的强烈要求，增设了汉语课，配备了汉语教师。派往帐篷小学的汉族教师认真学习毛主席著作，树立为哈萨克族人民服务的思想，积极学习民族语言，并且运用民族语言进行汉语教学，在工作中取得了一定成绩，受到了少数民族学生、干部和群众的欢迎。
    十多年来，帐篷小学就这样从群众的生产、生活实际需要出发，群众需要办怎样的形式，学校就办成怎样的形式，群众需要什么，学校就教什么，因地制宜，因时制宜，深受牧民群众的欢迎和赞扬，帐篷小学在牧民的心里已经深深扎根。牧民群众说：“咱们自己的学校就是好。”
        决心做牧区文化播种人
    我们深深地体会到，只有坚持活学活用毛主席著作，才能在实际工作中贯彻执行党的教育方针，坚持把学校办好。帐篷小学的教师少，班次多，一般每所学校只有两三名教师，但每校却有五六个班，教学任务繁重，而且环境和条件都较固定小学简陋、艰苦得多，可是帐篷小学的教师们不辞艰辛，孜孜不倦地长年累月在草原上跟随牧民和畜群辗转奔波，经历着这样或那样的困难，勤勤恳恳地工作着，把自己的青春和智慧献给草原的教育事业，关键就在于他们听党的话，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。一九六○年，帐篷小学增设了汉语课，派往帐篷小学的汉语教师都是来自外地的师范毕业学生。这些汉族青年，久居城市和农村，不习惯少数民族的生活，更没有接触过少数民族语言，但是他们怀着满腔热情来到帐篷小学。开始，他们讲的学生听不懂，学生讲的他们听不懂。在这种情况下，加上地区环境艰苦，学校条件简陋，有的人有些动摇，但是，毛主席著作坚定了他们为牧民服务的思想，在民族教师的帮助下，他们自学哈语哈文，现在已经能用民族语言进行汉语教学了。同样，民族教师们大都是从民族学院毕业回乡的知识青年。一九六○年，帐篷小学开始试行哈萨克新文字，民族教师没有一个参加过新文字的训练，但他们经过自学，很快掌握了新文字书写、拼音规则。有的教师数学程度较低，他们就在汉族教师的帮助下自修提高。所有这些都充分说明，如果没有树立为人民服务的思想，没有高度的革命热情，害怕吃苦受累，要做到这些是不可能的。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能吃大苦耐大劳，坚忍顽强地战胜各种困难，把社会主义新文化的种子，播种到牧区最需要的地方。
    党的群众路线是我们一切工作的根本路线，也是我们办好帐篷小学的根本路线。帐篷小学刚建立不久，有的人就反对帐篷小学，说什么“帐篷小学不象个学校的样子”、“质量低”等等，但是大多数群众都非常拥护和支持。一九六二年以前，帐篷小学用的帐篷、教师巡回教学乘骑的马匹，都是依靠群众解决的。近几年来，帐篷小学发展、扩大所需要的教具和取暖设备，以及一些不便走读的学生的食宿问题，我们也都是依靠集体，依靠群众解决的。十多年来，无数事实教育我们，要办好这种革命的学校，必须坚定地走群众路线，时时依靠群众，相信群众，并明确地树立一切为了群众的观点。（附图片）
