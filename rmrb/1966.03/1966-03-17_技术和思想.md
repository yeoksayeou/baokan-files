    Technology and Ideology
    "Breaking through key problems" requires not only high-level technology but also high-level thinking. Without good ideology, even with good technology, breakthroughs are impossible.
    The warp knitting machine project had been stuck for several years, with constant emphasis on the lack of technical cadres and engineers. Later, a research institute director was invited, who was supposed to be a "technical authority." Unexpectedly, after looking at the machine, he said that your yarn frame was "the most backward and useless." As a result, the problem still wasn't solved.
    This time, in "breaking through key problems," we used Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and relied on the workers. Everyone studied together on-site, using the same "most backward and useless" yarn frame, and quickly solved the problem, successfully "breaking through."
    It's clear that the reason the warp knitting machine was stuck for years was not primarily a technical problem but an ideological one; not primarily a lack of technical cadres and engineers but a lack of people who grasped Mao Zedong Thought.

    技术和思想
    “攻关”，不但要技术高，更要人的思想高。没有好的思想，就算有好的技术，也是攻不动的。
    经编机搞了几年过不了关，总是强调缺乏技术干部、工程师。后来请来一位研究所长，这应该说是“技术权威”了。不料他看了看机器说，你们的纱架是“最落后的，没有用了”，结果，还是没有解决问题。
    这次“攻关”，用毛泽东思想挂帅，依靠工人。大家在现场共同研究，用的还是那“最落后的，没有用了”的纱架，很快就解决了问题，把“关”攻下来了。
    可见，经编机几年不过关，主要不是技术问题，是思想问题；主要不是缺乏技术干部，缺乏工程师，而是缺乏掌握毛泽东思想的人。
