    The Mizo Hills, also known as the Lushai Hills, are one of the six hill districts of Assam, India. Located at the southernmost tip of Assam, it is a hill district under the jurisdiction of Assam, with its county seat in Aizawl. The county covers an area of ​​more than 8,000 square miles and has a population of 266,000, belonging to two tribes - the Mizo tribe and the Lushai tribe.
    This area originally belonged to Burma and was ceded to the East India Company in 1826, later becoming a county in India. The Mizo people have a history of struggle against colonialists and reactionary foreign rule. During the rule of British colonialists, several bloody so-called "punitive expeditions" were carried out in this area, all of which were resisted by the Mizo people.
    After India declared independence, the Congress Party government consistently implemented policies of discrimination and oppression against the tribal people in the mountainous areas, and the vast majority of tribal people in the mountainous areas lived in great suffering. The Mizo tribal people have waged a long-term struggle to resist the discrimination and rule of the Congress Party government. In March 1964, the Mizo tribal people launched fierce attacks on several government strongholds. On February 28 this year, the Mizo tribe launched an armed riot of 10,000 people. This struggle came with great momentum. The Congress Party government had to admit that "the rebellion was not expected to happen so suddenly." (Jiu) (Attached image)

    米佐地区和米佐部族
    米佐山区或称卢赛山区，为印度阿萨姆邦六个山区之一。它处于阿萨姆邦的最南端，是阿萨姆邦管辖的一个山区县，县府设在艾贾尔。全县面积八千多平方英里，人口二十六万六千人，属于两个部族——米佐部族和卢赛部族。
    这个地区原属缅甸，于一八二六年割让给东印度公司，后来成为印度的一个县。米佐人民有着反抗殖民者和异族反动统治的斗争历史。在英国殖民者统治期间，曾对这一地区进行过几次血腥的所谓“惩罚性的远征”，都遭到了米佐人的抗击。
    印度宣布独立后，国大党政府对山区部族一贯实行歧视和压迫的政策，广大山区部族人民生活非常痛苦。米佐部族人民为反抗国大党政府的歧视和统治，进行了长期的斗争。一九六四年三月，米佐部族人就曾对政府的若干据点进行过猛烈的袭击。今年二月二十八日，米佐部族举行万人武装暴动。这次斗争，来势迅猛。国大党政府也不得不承认：“没有预料到会这么突然地发生叛乱。”　　　　　（久）（附图片）
