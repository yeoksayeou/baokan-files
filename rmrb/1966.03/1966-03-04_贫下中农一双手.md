    The poor and lower-middle peasants' two hands,
    With hard bones and thick calluses,
    Are towering pillars of steel,
    Are iron axes that split mountains and open roads.
    Following Chairman Mao at Jinggang Mountain,
    The red flag flutters in the wind with a whoosh.
    Grasping red-tasseled spears tightly,
    Daring to fight tigers and wolves;
    Building the world with bare hands,
    Overthrowing great mountains to build new houses,
    All relies on our two hands, ah,
    All relies on our two hands.
    On the socialist road to happiness,
    We stride forward at the very front.
    Poor in wealth but rich in ambition,
    Not afraid of shedding blood and sweat;
    The Dazhai spirit transforms heaven and earth,
    Weaving magnificent embroidery across the vast land,
    All relies on our two hands, ah,
    All relies on our two hands.
    We never forget our poor brothers when we are liberated,
    Thunderstorms shake the globe,
    Workers and peasants making revolution rely on our own two hands;
    The glorious and radiant red sun,
    Mao Zedong Thought shines in our hearts,
    Forever following the Communist Party,
    Forever moving forward.
    The poor and lower-middle peasants' two hands, ah,
    With hard bones and thick calluses,
    Are towering pillars of steel,
    Are iron axes that split mountains and open roads!

    贫下中农一双手
    黄婴　廖代谦贫下中农一双手，骨头硬，茧疤厚，是顶天立地的钢柱子，是劈山开路的铁斧头。井冈山跟着咱毛主席，哗啦啦红旗迎风抖。紧握红缨枪，敢和虎狼斗；赤手空拳打天下，推倒大山盖新楼，全靠咱一双手啊，全靠咱一双手。社会主义的幸福路，咱大步走在最前头。人穷志气高，不怕血汗流；大寨精神改天地，万里河山织锦绣，全靠咱一双手啊，全靠咱一双手。咱翻身不忘穷兄弟，风雷震荡看全球，工农闹革命，靠咱自己一双手；光辉灿烂的红太阳，毛泽东思想照心头，永远跟着共产党，永远向前走。贫下中农一双手啊，骨头硬，茧疤厚，是顶天立地的钢柱子，是劈山开路的铁斧头！
