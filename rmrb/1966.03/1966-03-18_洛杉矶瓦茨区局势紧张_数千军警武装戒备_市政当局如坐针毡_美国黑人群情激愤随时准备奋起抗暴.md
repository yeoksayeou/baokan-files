    Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, 17th Dispatch: The situation in the Watts district of Los Angeles remains highly tense after the fierce black anti-violence struggle that erupted on the 15th. US officials admit that blacks could unleash a new storm of struggle at any time.

    According to Western news agency reports, sporadic fighting continued in every corner of the Watts district on the morning of the 16th, with blacks continuing to attack stores that have consistently defrauded and exploited them.

    Fearing that blacks would once again launch anti-violence struggles, a large number of police wearing steel helmets and carrying live ammunition continued to "patrol the streets of Watts timidly" on the 16th. Some police even climbed onto rooftops, fearing sniper activity by blacks. At the same time, 3,000 National Guardsmen remained on alert, ready to suppress the black people's struggle at any time.

    The Washington authorities, unnerved by the black people's struggle, have been monitoring the situation in Watts by telephone, and the US Department of Justice has been reporting the developments to President Johnson at all times.

    Los Angeles Mayor Yorty admitted in a speech on the 16th that the black masses were filled with anger. He said with lingering fear, "The situation may deteriorate tonight. ... We understand the potential of these people (referring to blacks), and we must be prepared."

    According to supplementary reports from Western news agencies, the number of people participating in the black anti-violence struggle on the 15th reached 700 at one point, most of whom were black teenagers and students.

    Mexican-Americans, who are in the same position of oppression and enslavement as black people, also bravely participated in the Watts district's black anti-violence struggle.

    Some black youths wore shirts printed with the profile of the late black leader Malcolm X. This black leader was conspiratorially murdered by the reactionary ruling group in Harlem a year ago.

    After the outbreak of the black people's anti-violence struggle, the Los Angeles municipal authorities immediately mobilized half of the city's police cars to the Watts district. The reactionary police blockaded the affected areas of 36 blocks with roadblocks and carried out a frenzied suppression of the black people. It is reported that at least 60 people were arrested, nearly half of whom were juveniles. In this struggle, the black people, regardless of police suppression and the obstruction of right-wing black movement "leaders" present, fought with the police for six hours with stones, bullets, and Molotov cocktails.

    洛杉矶瓦茨区局势紧张　数千军警武装戒备　市政当局如坐针毡
    美国黑人群情激愤随时准备奋起抗暴
    新华社十七日讯　洛杉矶消息：在十五日爆发了激烈的黑人抗暴斗争以后，洛杉矶市瓦茨区的局势仍然十分紧张。美国官员承认，黑人随时都可以掀起新的斗争风暴。
    据西方通讯社报道，十六日清晨，瓦茨区的各个角落仍不时发生零星的战斗，黑人们继续袭击一贯欺诈和剥削他们的商店。
    由于害怕黑人再次掀起抗暴斗争，当局派出的大批头戴钢盔、荷枪实弹的警察十六日继续“在瓦茨区的街道上胆怯地巡逻”。有些警察还爬上屋顶，生怕黑人们的狙击活动。同时，三千名国民警卫队仍然处于戒备状态，准备随时镇压黑人的斗争。
    被黑人的斗争吓得心神不安的华盛顿当局一直通过电话掌握瓦茨区的局势，美国司法部还随时把局势的发展情况报告给总统约翰逊。
    洛杉矶市市长约蒂十六日在谈话中承认黑人群众情绪激愤，他心有余悸地说，“今天晚上局势有可能恶化。……我们了解这些人（指黑人）的潜在力，我们必须作好准备。”
    据西方通讯社补充报道，在十五日的黑人抗暴斗争中，参加的人数一度达到七百，其中大部分是黑人青少年学生。
    和黑人同样处于被压迫被奴役地位的墨西哥裔美国人，也英勇地参加了瓦茨区黑人抗暴斗争的行列。
    一些黑人青年穿着印有已故黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯的侧面象的衬衫。这位黑人领袖是在一年前在哈莱姆区被反动统治集团阴谋杀害的。
    在黑人的抗暴斗争爆发后，洛杉矶市政当局立即调集全市一半的警车到瓦茨区。反动警察一面用路障封锁了达三十六块地段的出事地区，一面对黑人们进行疯狂的镇压。据报道，被逮捕的群众至少有六十人，其中近一半是少年。在这次斗争中，黑人们不顾警察的镇压和右翼黑人运动“领袖”在场阻挠，用石块、枪弹和燃烧瓶同警察搏斗了六小时。
