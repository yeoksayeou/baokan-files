    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th: The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published an article on the 14th pointing out that the American invaders' heavily touted "Big Red One"—the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—has been battered beyond recognition by the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians in the eight months since it intruded into South Vietnam. It has become the most disastrous and loss-ridden defeated army among the U.S. forces invading Vietnam.
    The article stated that the 1st Infantry Division, regarded by the American invaders as the "ace" of the U.S. Army, has so far been annihilated by the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians to the tune of six battalions, two companies, and six tank/armored vehicle detachments. In addition, one battalion and one artillery company suffered serious losses, with nearly 8,000 soldiers eliminated, accounting for half of the division's total strength. The "prestige" of the U.S. Army's "ace" division has been burned away by the flames of the people's war on the heroic land of South Vietnam.
    The article said that despite the division possessing a large number of airplanes and artillery pieces, and with airplanes flying overhead in every battle, and tanks and armored vehicles swarming around with artillery cover from all sides, the steel, bombs, shells, and all other strict defense measures in the air and on the ground could not save it from the deadly blows of the heroic Liberation Army. The Liberation Army and guerrillas of the southeastern region of South Vietnam, with their heroic, tenacious, ingenious, and creative tactics, have maximized the limitations on the role of its airplanes, artillery, and armored vehicles. It is not only helpless against the Liberation Army, but also powerless in the face of the strong combat capabilities of the guerrillas. During the "mopping-up" operation in Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, thousands of American soldiers, with an armored vehicle every five meters for cover, still could not enter the Gai Suc village, which was defended by only six guerrillas.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th: The Vietnamese newspaper *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* published a commentary on the 14th pointing out that the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division has suffered a fatal blow after only six months of entering South Vietnam. According to statistics, in just five major battles, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces wiped out approximately 6,000 of them, accounting for more than one-third of the division's total strength. The Liberation Armed Forces also shot down, damaged, and destroyed more than 370 of its aircraft, equivalent to four-fifths of the division's original number of aircraft.
    The commentary said, why did this "darling" division of the United States suffer such a rapid and disastrous defeat? It does not lack equipment for rapid "mobility," but in battle, when its airplanes and tanks cannot play a role, the morale also weakens accordingly. Especially when suddenly attacked, or in close combat and bayonet fighting, when the protective role of airplanes and artillery disappears, these American soldiers become even more panicked. The fact that the 1st Cavalry Division suffered disastrous defeats in the battles of Chu Pong Mountain, Ia Drang Valley, Phu My, and An Lao Valley powerfully illustrates this point.
    The commentary pointed out that, obviously, the people's war not only leaves the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division with no place to stand in South Vietnam, just like other American invading forces, but also increasingly turns this "mobile" division into a "paralyzed" division.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the disastrous defeat of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division on the South Vietnamese battlefield is a heavy blow to the American imperialists' theory of weapons being everything, and has placed them in a completely helpless predicament tactically.

### 南越人民战争粉碎了美国唯武器论  美国两个“王牌”师都落得个大失败  越南报纸欢呼南越军民痛歼美国步兵师和骑兵师的辉煌胜利

    南越人民战争粉碎了美国唯武器论
    美国两个“王牌”师都落得个大失败
    越南报纸欢呼南越军民痛歼美国步兵师和骑兵师的辉煌胜利
    据新华社河内十四日电越南《人民报》十四日发表文章指出，美国侵略者大肆吹嘘的“大红一”——美国第一步兵师闯进越南南方八个月来，已经被英雄的越南南方军民打得焦头烂额，成为侵越美军中失败最惨、损失最大的一支败军。
    文章说，被美国侵略者视为美国陆军中“王牌”的第一步兵师，到目前为止，已被英雄的南越军民歼灭了六个营、两个连和六个坦克、装甲车队，此外还有一个营和一个炮兵连遭到严重损失，被歼兵员近八千名，占这个师总兵力的一半。美国陆军“王牌”师的“威名”，在英雄的越南南方土地上，已经被人民战争的烈火烧掉了。
    文章说，尽管这个师拥有大量飞机和大炮，每次战斗中都是飞机在头上飞，坦克和装甲车前簇后拥，四面又有炮兵掩护，可是，地上和空中的钢铁、炸弹、炮弹以及其它一切严密的防御措施，都不能使它逃脱英雄的解放军的致命打击。越南南方南部东区的解放军和游击队以英勇、顽强、机智和创造性的战术，最大限度地限制了它的飞机、大炮和战车的作用。它不仅对解放军束手无策，而且在游击队的坚强战斗力面前也无能为力。在对嘉定省古芝县进行的“扫荡”中，数以千计的美军隔五米有一辆装甲车作掩护，但仍然无法开进只有六个游击队员防守的盖熟村。
    据新华社河内十四日电越南《人民军队报》十四日发表评论指出，美国第一骑兵师进入越南南方才六个月，就遭到了致命的打击。据统计，仅在五次大的战斗中，南越解放武装力量就把它吃掉了约六千名，占这个师总兵力的三分之一以上，解放武装力量还击落、击伤和炸毁它的三百七十多架飞机，相当于这个师原有飞机总数的五分之四。
    评论说，为什么美国的这个“宠儿”师会这样迅速地遭到惨败呢？它并不缺乏迅速
  “机动”的装备，但是，在战斗中，当它的飞机、坦克发挥不了作用时，连士气也跟着被削弱了。特别是突然遭到袭击，或者在近战、白刃战中，飞机、大炮的掩护作用消失了的时候，这些美军就更加惊慌失措。第一骑兵师在朱邦山、德浪河谷、蓬山、安老河谷等战斗中遭到惨败的事实，有力地说明了这一点。
    评论指出，显然，人民战争不仅使美国第一骑兵师象其他美国侵略军一样，在越南南方无立锥之地，而且使这个“机动”师日益变成了“瘫痪”师。
    评论最后说，美国第一骑兵师在南越战场上的惨败，是对美帝国主义唯武器论的一个沉重打击，并且使它在战术上完全处于束手无策的窘境。
