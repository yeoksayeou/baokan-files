    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. From the 15th to the 18th, most areas of Northeast China successively experienced snow and rain. According to information provided by the meteorological department, the rainfall and snowfall in Liaoning Province were relatively heavy. In the Dalian, Yingkou, and Dandong areas of this province, precipitation reached 20 to 30 millimeters. The Chaoyang, Jinzhou, and Fushun areas received 14 millimeters of precipitation, and other areas generally received about 20 millimeters of precipitation. Jilin Province had widespread snowfall, with heavy snow in the central region, and precipitation reaching 10 to 13 millimeters. Southeastern Heilongjiang Province also experienced snowfall, but the amount of snow was very small.
    This snowfall and rainfall are beneficial to spring plowing and production. However, relevant departments pointed out that we must not relax our efforts to prevent spring drought because of this, especially in areas with less snow and rain or no snow and rain at all, we should pay more attention to preventing spring drought.

    东北大部地区普降好雪好雨
    新华社十八日讯　从十五日到十八日，东北大部地区先后下雪下雨。据气象部门提供的情况，辽宁省雨雪较大，这个省的旅大、营口和丹东地区降水量达二十到三十毫米，朝阳、锦州和抚顺地区降水十四毫米，其他地区一般降水二十毫米左右。吉林省普遍下雪，中部地区下了大雪，降水量达十到十三毫米。黑龙江省东南部也下了雪，雪量很小。
    这次下雪下雨，对春耕生产有利。但是，有关部门指出，绝不能因此放松预防春旱的工作，特别是雪雨较小和没有下雪下雨的地方更要注意预防春旱。
