    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 28th. The *Cambodia Telegram* published a commentary on the 28th entitled "Indonesia in a Fascist Era," condemning the various anti-China atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The commentary said that these anti-China atrocities "are provocative actions organized by Indonesian reactionary forces and directed by U.S. imperialism."

    The commentary said: "Fanaticism and racism are both linked to reactionary forces, which are trying every means to divide the masses in order to further oppress them. Both old and new fascists have been carrying out these activities. Therefore, it is not surprising that an anti-China wave has appeared in Indonesia when a group of agents of U.S. imperialism seized power."

    The commentary pointed out: "For U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the People's China is the number one enemy. Why is this so? Because China stands at the forefront of the people's democratic forces who are constantly and uncompromisingly fighting against U.S. imperialism and its agents. Because China embodies (whether people like it or not, this is a fact) the will of all peace-loving and justice-upholding peoples to fight against world reactionary forces. Because China has always refused to make shameful compromises with the enemies of all countries' people to betray the interests of revolutionary democratic forces."

    The commentary said: "Therefore, U.S. imperialism will do everything possible to launch the most violent attacks on People's China, to isolate China, and to undermine China's relations with countries that have dealings with China. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is bound to order its lackeys everywhere to organize anti-China 'spontaneous demonstrations' and 'mass movements.' This is what is happening in Indonesia."

    The *Cambodia Telegram's* commentary continued: "This cannot deceive anyone. The puppets everywhere are trying their best to cover up their doomed schemes, but this is in vain, and no force can prevent international opinion from knowing the ugly drama they are staging. The Indonesian people are also condemning the brutal crimes of their tyrants."

    The commentary said: "These running dogs of American warmongers are wasting time and energy, because their plans are doomed to failure. The Indonesian people are waiting for the moment to settle accounts for the treacherous activities and bad deeds of these running dogs."

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, March 26th. Pathet Lao Radio broadcast a commentary on the 25th, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the pro-U.S. reactionary clique in Indonesia in bloodily suppressing, arresting, and massacring Indonesian patriotic and progressive people.

    The commentary emphasized, "The Lao people strongly protest and condemn the barbaric suppression of patriotic and progressive forces and people in Indonesia by the pro-U.S. reactionary clique in Indonesia, and demand that they immediately stop this barbaric action and immediately restore the freedom of the patriotic people they have illegally arrested."

    The commentary concluded, "The Lao people are deeply convinced that, no matter what, the Indonesian patriotic and progressive forces and the people will surely achieve final victory, and the bloodthirsty reactionary clique will surely be punished as they deserve."

    柬报谴责美帝指挥印度尼西亚右派疯狂反华
    中国始终不向各国人民的敌人妥协
    巴特寮电台说印度尼西亚亲美反动集团必遭惩罚
    新华社金边二十八日电  《柬埔寨电讯报》二十八日以《印度尼西亚处于法西斯时期》为题发表评论，谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力的各种反华暴行。评论说，这种反华暴行“是由印度尼西亚反动势力组织的和由美帝国主义指挥的挑衅行动。”
    评论说：“狂热和种族主义都是同反动势力连在一起的，这种反动势力正在千方百计地企图分裂人民群众，从而进一步压迫人民群众。新老法西斯分子都一直在进行这些活动。因此，当美帝国主义的一批代理人夺取了政权的时候，印度尼西亚出现这种反华浪潮是不足为奇的。”
    评论指出：“对于美帝国主义及其走狗来说，人民中国是头号敌人。为什么这样说呢？因为中国站在正在不断地和毫不妥协地同美帝国主义及其代理人进行斗争的人民民主力量的前哨。因为中国体现了（不管人们愿意不愿意，这是事实）爱好和平与主持正义的各国人民反对世界反动势力的斗争意志。因为中国始终拒绝向各国人民的敌人进行可耻的妥协来出卖革命民主力量的利益。”
    评论说：“因此，美帝国主义就不惜一切代价对人民中国进行最猛烈的打击，就要孤立中国，就要破坏中国同与中国有来往的国家之间的关系。因此，美帝国主义势必要命令它在各地的走狗组织反华的‘自发的示威游行’和‘群众运动’。这就是印度尼西亚正在发生的事情。”
    《柬埔寨电讯报》的评论接着说：“这是欺骗不了任何人的。各地的傀儡正在竭力掩盖他们注定要失败的图谋，但是这是枉费心机的，任何势力都无法阻止国际舆论知道他们正在上演的丑剧。印度尼西亚人民也在谴责他们的暴君的残暴的罪行。”
    评论说：“美国好战分子的这些走狗是白费时间和精力的，因为他们的计划是注定要失败的。印度尼西亚人民正在等待着这样的时刻：对这些走狗的背叛活动和干下的坏事进行清算。”
    新华社康开二十六日电  巴特寮电台二十五日发表评论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动集团血腥镇压、逮捕和屠杀印度尼西亚爱国进步人民的法西斯暴行。
    评论强调说，“老挝人民强烈抗议和谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动集团对印度尼西亚爱国进步力量和人民进行的野蛮镇压，并且要求他们立即停止这种野蛮行动，立即恢复被他们非法逮捕的爱国人士的自由。”
    评论最后说，“老挝人民深信，不管怎样，印度尼西亚爱国进步力量以及人民必将取得最后胜利，而嗜血成性的反动集团必将遭到应有的惩罚。”
