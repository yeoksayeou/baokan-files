    我东方歌舞团在越南为工农兵演出
    据新华社河内四日电　中国东方歌舞团这些天来在红河三角洲各地，热情地为边战斗、边生产的越南广大军民举行慰问演出。
    从二月二十三日起，东方歌舞团分成了三个演出队分赴各地演出。演员们身背行囊，手持乐器，把充满中越两国人民友情的文艺节目，送到阵地上、工厂里和农村去。他们到处受到了当地军民热情的欢迎。
    在著名的钢铁城太原和英雄的纺织城南定，中国文艺战士们满怀着激动的心情，为努力生产和英勇战斗的越南工人兄弟歌唱。
    在一个个痛击美国空中强盗的钢铁阵地上，歌舞团的团员们以无比兴奋的心情，为越南人民军防空部队英勇的战士们举行了演出。英雄的炮手们在观看演出后热烈高呼“越中两国人民战斗友谊万岁”的口号，并且热情表示要进一步开展竞赛，打落更多的美国强盗飞机。歌舞团的文艺战士们还分别为许多民兵队和农业生产合作社的社员们进行了慰问演出。
