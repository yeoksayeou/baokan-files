    Emphasize Politics, Arm Women with Mao Zedong Thought
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 3) The National Women's Federation recently convened a symposium in Taiyuan for advanced grassroots women's congresses from twelve northern provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in our country. The meeting emphasized that in order to mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural women and to greet the agricultural production upsurge in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, take the women of Dazhai as an example, and advance women's work in rural areas to a new level.
    The women representatives and cadres participating in the meeting, taking the Dazhai Women's Congress as an example, conducted enthusiastic discussions, exchanged experiences with each other, identified shortcomings, and studied how to further strengthen women's work. Everyone realized that women's work must emphasize politics. Leading cadres at all levels of the Women's Federation must firmly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, implement the ideological revolutionization of the leading core; arm women's minds with Mao Zedong Thought to guide women's work; and carry out political and ideological work at the forefront of production, in all work, and in women's hearts. It is necessary to conscientiously study the experience of the Dazhai Women's Congress, learn from their experience of listening to Chairman Mao's words and closely following the central work of the Party; learn from their experience in political and ideological work, as well as closely contacting the masses of women and fully mobilizing the positive factors of the broad masses of women to invest in the three great revolutionary movements; and learn from their experience of starting from reality, and practically, meticulously, and thoroughly doing things for the masses of women.
    The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to liberate the broad masses of rural women from the small world of individuals and families, guide their eyes toward the collective, the country, and the world, and make them understand that laboring for the revolution and farming for the revolution is an extremely important political and ideological task. Representatives from various places mentioned at the meeting that women's work itself is a political work and must be a political work. To do a good job in women's work, the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's works. The meeting believed that in order to encourage rural women to study Chairman Mao's works well, first of all, leading cadres of Women's Federations at all levels and cadres of grassroots women's congresses must study well.
    The symposium introduced the experience and exemplary deeds of many advanced grassroots women's congresses in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Women's Federation of Lianjiazhuang Commune in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, made the women's work of the commune very active by organizing grassroots women cadres to study Chairman Mao's works. The Women's Federation of this commune established a women's work study station, and cadres of the women's congresses of the major teams regularly came to the station to study Chairman Mao's works. More than 230 grassroots women's congress cadres in the entire commune participated in the study, setting off a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. Spirit transforms into matter. In last year's fight against drought, women played a huge role. They watered the fields in shifts day and night, and independently completed the seedling protection task for more than 950 mu of cotton fields in the entire commune, and additionally planted more than 890 mu of experimental fields. The attendance rate of female labor in the entire commune increased from 60 percent in the past to more than 80 percent. The Women's Congress of the Second Brigade of Yixihala Commune in Kuqa County, Xinjiang, is a good example of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The cadres of the Women's Congress of this brigade took the lead in studying and applying, and they have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works for two years. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they overcame the "retreating slope thought" and were determined to carry out the revolution to the end. They did great things for the poor and lower-middle peasant women, helping 57 poor and lower-middle peasant households solve some problems in production and life. Due to the promotion of the Women's Congress, now 70 percent of adult women in the entire brigade regularly participate in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Shashi Yu Brigade of Yuegezhuang Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, encountered a particularly severe drought in 1965. The women repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They said: "The women of Dazhai can change the world, we must use the spirit of the new Foolish Old Man to fight the drought until the sky bows its head!" They and the male commune members carried water to fight the drought, fighting hard for 83 days. Many female commune members developed iron shoulders and iron feet. This drought-fighting struggle increased grain production, and also trained thinking and trained people. 37 "Iron Sisters-in-law" and 31 "Iron Girls" emerged in the entire brigade, and a total of 60 percent of adult women became various advanced figures.
    In organizing women to study Chairman Mao's works, the women's congresses in various places paid special attention to guiding them to break away from the narrow world and immediate interests. The women of Dazhai often said, "If the big river has water, the small river will be full," "Without the country, there is no collective, and without the collective, there is no individual." Some women in Sanhe Commune in Jingyuan County, Gansu Province, abandoned the idea of only caring about themselves and immediate interests after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Because of looking into the long-term and the overall interests, women in many places take diligence and frugality in household management as a major matter and realize that diligence and frugality in household management is an indispensable aspect of adhering to self-reliance, diligence and frugality in running cooperatives, and diligence and frugality in building the country. Dazhai women are models of diligence and frugality in managing their homes. They live rich days as poor days and associate the saving of a grain of grain or a foot of cloth with the interests of the revolution. Chen Yonggui said well: Diligence and frugality in managing the family can not only prepare for famine, but more importantly, when the country needs it, it has people, money, and food. With our material preparation of human and material resources, we are not afraid of imperialism bullying us. Taiping Brigade of Zhongxing Commune in Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, has had a good tradition of diligence and frugality in running cooperatives and diligence and frugality in managing their homes for many years. They said, "We regard grain as a treasure, and regard saving grain as a concrete manifestation of the revolution." Now more than 300 households in this brigade have saved grain and have more than 67,000 yuan in savings.
    All political and ideological work is specific and meticulous. In women's work, it is very important to carry out political and ideological work through individual examples and deeds. It was mentioned at the symposium that after studying Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," many rural grassroots women's congress cadres did a lot of in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work on individual examples and deeds, and achieved remarkable results.
    The symposium believed that emphasizing politics and putting Mao Zedong Thought in command is the key to raising the awareness of the masses of women and mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in socialist revolution and socialist construction; and to achieve this, Women's Federations at all levels must go deep into the masses, face the grassroots, and give full play to the role of grassroots women's congresses, and through millions of women representatives armed with Mao Zedong Thought, go to contact, unite, and educate the broad masses of women. This is an important link in doing a good job in women's work at present. This issue must attract the attention of cadres of Women's Federations at all levels.
    During the meeting, representatives from various places also visited Dazhai Brigade and listened to the experiences introduced by Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Dazhai Party Branch, and Song Liying, director of the Dazhai Women's Congress. Wei Heng, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, spoke at the meeting.
    Participating in this symposium were representatives of advanced grassroots women's congresses from rural areas in Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and leaders of women's federations in these regions, as well as Luo Qiong, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, and Secretaries Wu Qing, Wu Quanheng, and Dong Bian.

    全国妇联召开的北方十二个省、市、自治区农村先进基层妇代会座谈会，一致认为发动农村妇女参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设的关键是：
    突出政治　用毛泽东思想武装妇女
    据新华社三日讯　全国妇联最近在太原召开我国北方十二个省、市、自治区农村先进基层妇代会座谈会。会议强调，为了调动广大农村妇女的社会主义积极性，迎接第三个五年计划第一年的农业生产高潮，必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，以大寨妇女为榜样，把农村妇女工作推进到一个新的水平。
    参加会议的妇女代表和干部，以大寨妇代会为榜样，进行了热烈的讨论，她们相互交流经验，相互找差距，研究如何进一步加强妇女工作。大家认识到：妇女工作必须突出政治。各级妇联领导干部必须狠抓毛主席著作的学习，实行领导核心的思想革命化；用毛泽东思想武装妇女的头脑，指导妇女工作；把政治思想工作做到生产第一线，做到一切工作中去，做到妇女心里去；要扎扎实实地学习大寨妇代会的经验，学习她们听毛主席的话，紧跟党的中心工作的经验；学习他们的政治思想工作的经验，以及密切联系妇女群众，充分调动广大妇女的积极因素，投入三大革命运动的经验；学习她们从实际出发，切切实实、深入细致地为妇女群众办事的经验。
    会议指出，要把广大农村妇女从个人、家庭的小天地里解放出来，把她们的眼光引向集体、引向国家、引向世界，使她们明白为革命而劳动，为革命而种田，是一项极其重要的政治思想工作。各地代表在会上谈到，妇女工作本身就是一项政治工作，而且必须是一项政治工作。要做好妇女工作，千条万条，学习毛主席著作是最根本的一条。会议认为，要带动农村妇女学好毛主席著作，首先，各级妇联领导干部和基层妇代会的干部要学好。
    座谈会上介绍了许多先进基层妇代会活学活用毛主席著作的经验和模范事迹。河北省行唐县连家庄公社妇联通过组织基层妇女干部学习毛主席著作，使公社的妇女工作非常活跃。这个公社妇联创办了妇女工作学习站，各大队妇代会干部定期来站学习毛主席著作，全公社二百三十多名基层妇代会干部都参加了学习，掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮。精神变物质。在去年的抗旱斗争中，妇女们发挥了巨大的作用，她们昼夜轮流浇地，还独立地完成了全公社九百五十多亩棉田的保苗任务，另外种了八百九十多亩试验田。全公社妇女劳动力的出勤率由过去的百分之六十增加到百分之八十以上。新疆库车县伊西哈拉公社伊西哈拉二大队妇代会是活学活用毛主席著作的一个好样板。这个大队妇代会的干部带头学，带头用，她们两年来坚持学习毛主席著作。学习毛主席著作以后，她们克服了“退坡思想”，决心革命到底。她们给贫农下中农妇女大办好事，帮助五十七户贫农下中农解决生产和生活中的一些问题。由于妇代会的推动，现在全大队经常参加学习毛主席著作的妇女占成年妇女的百分之七十。河北省遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，在一九六五年遇到了特大的干旱。妇女们反复学习了《愚公移山》，她们说：“大寨妇女能够改天换地，咱们要以新愚公的精神，抗旱抗到天低头！”她们和男社员一起，担水抗旱，奋战八十三天，不少女社员练成铁肩膀、铁脚板。这场抗旱斗争，使粮食增了产，也练了思想练了人，全大队涌现出三十七名“铁大嫂”、三十一名“铁姑娘”，共有百分之六十的成年妇女成了各种先进人物。
    各地妇代会在组织妇女学习毛主席著作中，特别注意引导她们从狭小的天地和眼前利益中摆脱出来。大寨妇女经常说，“大河有水小河满”，“没有国家就没有集体，没有集体就没有个人”。甘肃省靖远县三合公社一些妇女在学习《纪念白求恩》以后抛弃了只顾个人、只顾眼前利益的思想。许多地方的妇女由于看到了长远利益和整体利益，把勤俭持家看成是一件有重大意义的事情，认识到勤俭持家是坚持自力更生、勤俭办社、勤俭建国的一个不可少的方面。大寨妇女是勤俭持家的模范，她们把富日子当穷日子过，把节约一粒粮、一尺布都同革命利益联系起来。陈永贵说得好：勤俭持家不仅可以备荒，更重要的是，一旦国家需要时，要人有人，要钱有钱，要粮有粮。我们有了人力物力的物质准备，就不怕帝国主义来欺负我们。黑龙江省甘南县中兴公社太平大队多年来一直有着勤俭办社、勤俭持家的好传统。她们说，“我们把粮食当成宝，把节约粮食看成是为革命的具体表现。”现在这个大队三百多户人家，家家都有节约的粮食，存款六万七千多元。
    任何政治思想工作，都是具体的，细致的。在妇女工作中，通过一人一事来做政治思想工作，是十分重要的。座谈会上谈到，许多农村基层妇代会的干部，学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》的文章后，做了大量深入、细致的一人一事的政治思想工作，收到了显著的效果。
    座谈会认为，突出政治，以毛泽东思想挂帅，是提高妇女群众的觉悟，发动广大妇女参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设的关键；而要做到这一点，各级妇联组织必须深入群众，面向基层，充分发挥基层妇代会的作用，通过千百万用毛泽东思想武装起来的妇女代表，去联系、团结、教育广大妇女。这是当前做好妇女工作的一个重要环节。这个问题必须引起各级妇联干部的注意。
    会议期间，各地代表还到大寨大队进行了参观，听了大寨党支部书记陈永贵和大寨妇代会主任宋立英介绍的经验。山西省委第一书记卫恒在会上讲了话。
    参加这次座谈会的，有北京市、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃、青海、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古自治区、宁夏回族自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区的农村先进基层妇代会的代表和这些地区妇联的领导人，以及全国妇联书记处第一书记罗琼，书记吴綪、吴全衡、董边。（附图片）
