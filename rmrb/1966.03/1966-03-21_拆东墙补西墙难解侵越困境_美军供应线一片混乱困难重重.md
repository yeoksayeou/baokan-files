    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Washington dispatch: Since the U.S. government drastically increased its troop deployment to South Vietnam in the latter half of last year and expanded its war of aggression, its strategic weaknesses of a distant rear, long supply lines, huge consumption, and difficult logistical support have been further exposed. In recent months, although the U.S. government has rackingly taken some piecemeal and stopgap measures, it still cannot change the predicament of being overwhelmed with difficulties and struggling to make ends meet. With the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. military in Vietnam is universally short of airplanes, guns, ammunition, communications equipment, and other military supplies. The U.S. aggressor troops, who rely on indiscriminate bombing to embolden themselves, consume ammunition at a particularly high rate, already greatly exceeding the level of the war of aggression against Korea, which has made ammunition even scarcer. To meet the needs of expanding the war, the U.S. government has had to rob Peter to pay Paul, withdrawing weapons and ammunition from troops stationed in Western Europe, domestic strategic reserves and reserve troops, and vassal state armies, and even once unloaded the machine guns on tanks of troops stationed in Western Europe and transported them to South Vietnam. Senator Stennis, chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee, recently revealed that, in order to solve the shortage of ammunition for the U.S. military in Vietnam, the U.S. government has had to withdraw certain weapons and ammunition from U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe to South Vietnam and withdraw ammunition from the Navy to give to the Air Force. U.S. military commentator Baldwin once said, "Vietnam enjoys priority, and other troop headquarters are being 'stripped bare'," "The U.S. military is uneasy about its ability to cope with simultaneous emergencies in other regions."

    Another difficulty in logistical support is the serious shortage of transportation. Ninety-eight percent of the supplies needed for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam are transported by sea. At the beginning of last year, the monthly volume of goods shipped to South Vietnam, Thailand, and other places was more than 300,000 tons, but after November of the same year, it surged to more than 700,000 tons per month (excluding oil). Due to high war consumption and the need for more materials, and the long time it takes for ships to unload their cargo after arriving at South Vietnamese ports, the low turnover rate of ships, the problem of insufficient transportation tools is even more prominent. As the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam becomes increasingly unpopular, the number of foreign merchant ships leased by the U.S. government is decreasing. The Mexican government has banned Mexican ships from going to South Vietnam, and the Greek government has also banned Greek ships from transporting war materials to South Vietnam.

    At the same time, the capacity of South Vietnamese ports and airports is limited, and congestion is serious. Most of the ports in South Vietnam do not have deep-water berths and have poor loading and unloading equipment, so ships often take one to twenty days to three to forty days to unload their cargo after arriving at the port. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara admitted on March 1 that 122 ships were waiting to be loaded and unloaded in South Vietnam last November, and there are still often more than 40 ships. An Associated Press report from Washington on the 12th said that airport capacity had also reached "saturation point." The U.S. Air Force magazine in December of last year said that after the transport planes of the Military Airlift Command arrived in South Vietnam, "finding a parking space is also a problem."

    In South Vietnam, land transportation is basically paralyzed, and railway and highway transportation is difficult. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has already controlled 80% of the South Vietnamese territory. On the more than 1,300 kilometers of railway lines in South Vietnam, the U.S.-puppet army, with armored vehicles leading the way and air cover, can barely operate on only more than 500 kilometers. Even highways near major cities must be patrolled by armed escorts before they can pass. At present, the U.S.-puppet supply mainly relies on air and water transport. However, the capacity of air and water transport is limited, so there is often a lot of materials piled up in the port, while the front-line troops cannot get supplies. Even among the materials that can be transported ashore and to the battlefield, the vice president of the U.S. Seamen's Union admitted after visiting South Vietnam in February that a large part of them fell into the hands of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.

### 拆东墙补西墙难解侵越困境  美军供应线一片混乱困难重重

    拆东墙补西墙难解侵越困境
    美军供应线一片混乱困难重重
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府去年下半年大举增兵南越，扩大侵略战争以来，后方太远、补给线长、消耗巨大、后勤供应困难这个战略弱点，更加暴露。近几个月来，美国政府虽然挖空心思采取了一些东拼西凑、剜肉补疮的措施，但仍然无法改变困难重重、捉襟见肘的困境。随着侵越战争的扩大，侵越美军在飞机、枪支、弹药、通讯器材以及其他军需用品的供应上普遍不足。依靠狂轰滥炸来壮胆的美国侵略军，弹药消耗特别大，已经大大超过侵朝战争的水平，这使弹药更加缺乏。为了满足扩大战争的需要，美国政府不得不拆东墙补西墙，从驻西欧部队、国内战略预备队和后备役部队、仆从国军队中抽调武器和军火，甚至一度把驻西欧部队坦克上的机枪卸下运往南越。参议院军备小组委员会主席斯坦尼斯最近也透露，为了解决侵越美军军火的不足，美国政府不得不从美国驻西欧部队抽调某些武器和军火到南越，从海军中抽调军火给空军。美国军事评论员鲍德温曾说，
  “越南享有优先权，其他部队司令部正在被‘剥光’”，“美国三军对在其他地区同时发生紧急情况的应付能力感到不安”。
    后勤供应上的另一个困难是运输工具严重不足。美国侵越战争所需要的补给物资，百分之九十八靠海运。去年年初，运往南越、泰国等地的物资每月为三十多万吨，到同年十一月以后每月激增到七十多万吨
  （不包括油料）。由于战争消耗大，需要物资多，而船只到南越港口后卸货时间长，船只周转率低，运输工具不足的问题就更加突出。由于美国侵越战争越来越不得人心，美国政府租用到的外国商船正在减少。墨西哥政府禁止墨西哥船去南越，希腊政府也禁止希腊船只向南越运送战争物资。
    同时，南越港口、机场容量有限，壅塞情况严重。南越的多数港口没有深水码头、装卸设备差，因此船只到达港口，往往要一、二十天到三、四十天才能卸货。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉三月一日承认，去年十一月在南越等待装卸的船只达一百二十二艘，目前仍经常有四十多艘。美联社十二日从华盛顿发出报道说，机场容量也已经达到了“饱和点”。去年十二月的美国《空军》杂志说，军事空运局的运输机到达南越后“找一块停机坪也成问题”。
    在南越当地，陆上交通基本上陷于瘫痪，铁路公路运输困难。南越解放军已经控制南越百分之八十地区。在南越的一千三百多公里的铁路线上，美伪军在装甲车开路和飞机掩护下，勉强能够通车的只有五百多公里。连主要城市附近的公路也必须有武装护送才能通行。目前美伪补给主要依靠空运和水运。而空运、水运的能力是有限的，因此，往往港口内物资堆积很多，而前线部队却得不到供应。就是在能够运到岸上和战地的物资中，美国海员工会副主席在二月间访问南越后承认，有很大一部分落到了南越人民武装的手里。
