    Once You've Got It Right, Go All Out!
    The land in Yucheng is mostly waterlogged, saline-alkali land, suffering from disasters in nine out of ten years, making it impossible to guarantee harvests. In the winter of 1964, the county party committee, through investigation and research, discovered that crops planted along the edges of ditches and ponds in various places were not afraid of waterlogging. Summarizing this experience and repeatedly consulting with experienced farmers, they decided to conduct trials in two large brigades. The pilot project proved that this was a good way to transform waterlogged, saline-alkali land. The CCP Yucheng County Committee, seeing that this was the right path, resolutely led the masses to go all out, launching a mass movement to build terraced fields and strip fields.
    The *Henan Daily* published an editorial saying: “Seeing right, this is correctly understanding the objective world; going all out, this is striving to transform the objective world. Once you've got it right, you must go all out.” This means, on the basis of understanding and grasping the laws of development of objective things, seizing the main contradiction, and giving full play to subjective initiative to transform the objective world in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This is the fighting style of thoroughgoing proletarian revolutionaries.
    To see right, it is necessary to conduct detailed and thorough investigation and research work. In particular, it is necessary to set up pilot projects, conduct experiments, and constantly summarize experience, exploring the laws of objective things in the process of breaking through a single point and conducting a comprehensive analysis. Without this, one cannot see right, and if one goes all out, one will certainly not achieve good results. Therefore, for things that are not seen right, it is necessary to go deep into reality, investigate and research, and conduct experiments. Without this strict scientific attitude, it is impossible to do things well.
    Going all out once you've got it right means taking the correct opinions that have been formed to the masses, and through in-depth ideological work and meticulous organizational work, turning them into the conscious actions of the masses. Adopt the method of using points to lead the whole area, combining points and areas, launching mass movements on a large scale, and concentrating forces to fight battles of annihilation. This kind of going all out is scientific and sound, and will inevitably achieve results that are more, faster, better, and more economical.

    看准了就大干
    虞城的土地，大半是涝洼盐碱地，十年九灾，不能保收。一九六四年冬季，县委在调查研究中，发现各地都有一些沟边塘边种的庄稼不怕涝。总结了这个经验，又同老农反复商量，便决定在两个大队试办。试点证明，这是改变涝洼盐碱地的好办法。中共虞城县委看准了这条道路，坚定不移地领导群众大干，掀起了一个大修台田、条田的群众运动。
    《河南日报》发表社论说：看准，这是正确认识客观世界；大干，这是努力改造客观世界。看准了就要大干。这就是在认识和掌握客观事物发展规律的基础上，抓住主要矛盾，充分发挥主观能动性，多快好省地改造客观世界。这是无产阶级彻底革命派的战斗风格。
    要看准，就需要进行细致周密的调查研究工作。特别需要办点，搞试验，不断总结经验，在突破一点和全面分析的过程中，探索客观事物的规律。不如此，就看不准，如果大干起来，就一定干不出好的结果。因此，看不准的事情，就要深入实际，调查研究，进行试验。没有这种严格的科学态度，是不可能把事情办好的。
    看准了大干，就是说，把已经形成的正确意见，拿到群众中去，通过深入的思想工作和细致的组织工作，使之变成群众的自觉行动。采取以点带面、点面结合的方法，大搞群众运动，集中力量打歼灭战。这样的大干，是科学的稳妥的，必然收到多快好省的效果。
