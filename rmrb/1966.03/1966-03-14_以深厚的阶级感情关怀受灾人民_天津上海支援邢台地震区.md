    Caring for Disaster-Stricken People with Profound Class Feelings
    Tianjin and Shanghai Support the Xingtai Earthquake Area
    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th. The people of Tianjin and Shanghai, with profound class feelings, are concerned about the masses in the Xingtai area who suffered from the earthquake, and have given strong support to the people in the disaster area.
    Starting from the afternoon of the day the earthquake occurred, Tianjin Municipality successively dispatched several batches of medical teams, led by Lu Da, Vice Mayor of Tianjin, to work in the disaster area. At the same time, Shanghai and Tianjin, at the fastest speed, transported batches of first-aid medicines, medical equipment, and daily necessities to the disaster area. The pharmaceutical procurement and supply departments of these two cities were very prompt in this allocation work. The Party Committee Secretary, Manager, and employees of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Procurement and Supply Station loaded medicines together, and many employees even forgot to eat, loading boxes of medicines and equipment onto trucks. Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company specially established a leading group to ensure the supply of medicines and equipment needed in the disaster area. The Tianjin Non-staple Food Bureau also transported many cooked foods such as biscuits and bread to the disaster area.
    Workers in the transportation departments of Tianjin and Shanghai went all out to transport relief materials to the disaster area in the shortest possible time. After receiving the task of shipping relief materials on the evening of the 9th, many employees who were watching movies immediately rushed to the airport. Leading cadres, service personnel, drivers, and others quickly loaded medicines and other materials into the cabin. The plane flew to Beijing that night. In order to save time, the Tianjin Railway Bureau dispatched a special train to the disaster area on the day the earthquake occurred, delivering relief materials and medical personnel to the disaster area in a timely manner.

    以深厚的阶级感情关怀受灾人民
    天津上海支援邢台地震区
    新华社十三日讯　天津、上海两市人民以深厚的阶级感情关怀着邢台地区因地震受灾的群众，并且给了灾区群众以大力支援。
    天津市从地震发生的当天下午开始，就陆续派出了几批医疗队，由天津市副市长路达率领前往灾区工作。在此同时，上海、天津两地以最快的速度，把成批的急救药品、医疗器械和生活用品运到受灾地区。这两个城市的医药采购供应部门，在这次调拨工作中都非常及时。上海医药采购供应站的党委书记、经理和职工们一起装运药品，许多职工连饭也顾不上吃，把一箱箱药械装上汽车。天津市医药公司专门成立了领导小组来保证灾区所需药品器械的供应。天津市副食品局还为灾区运去了许多饼干、面包等熟食。
    天津、上海两地运输部门的职工都全力以赴，在最短时间内把救灾物资运往灾区。上海龙华飞机场九日晚接到启运救灾物资的任务后，许多正在看电影的职工立即赶到机场，领导干部和服务员、驾驶员等一起迅速把药品等物资装进机舱。飞机在当夜飞到北京。天津铁路局为争取时间，在地震发生的当天向灾区开出专车，把救灾物资和医疗人员及时送到了灾区。
