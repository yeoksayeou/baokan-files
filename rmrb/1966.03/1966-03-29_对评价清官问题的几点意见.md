    Summary: Clean officials are the hope of the peasants. Peasants praising clean officials is an accusation against corrupt officials. We need the spirit of Hai Rui.

    Some comrades say that clean officials in the old society were all loyal running dogs of the rulers, emerging to maintain the reactionary rule when the ruling class faced a crisis. These people were more insidious and worse than corrupt and cruel officials. Their actions played a role in easing class contradictions, suppressing peasant revolutions, and hindering social development, so they should not be promoted or praised. This is a mechanical view. May I ask: if we follow this line of reasoning, shouldn't we praise corrupt and cruel officials? Because corrupt and cruel officials oppress the people the most severely. Where there is oppression, there is resistance, and the more severe the oppression, the more intense the resistance, which will lead to major revolutionary actions and promote social progress. In this way, corrupt and cruel officials become great contributors to social development. Isn't this turning black and white upside down and promoting evil?

    Social development has extremely complex factors. Of course, social development can only be achieved through the struggle of the people. Various resistance struggles, especially armed struggles to overthrow reactionary rule, drive social progress. However, understanding this law came only after Marxism. We cannot say that Hai Rui, in the feudal society of the Ming Dynasty, had the mind to recognize this law, and therefore consciously eased class contradictions, prevented the emergence of revolution, in order to maintain the reactionary feudal rule. Therefore, we must historically affirm or negate the character of the ancients, and cannot arbitrarily say that in the feudal era there were no officials who sympathized with the people. Otherwise, we are viewing feudal society too simply, and not analyzing and viewing feudal society with a dialectical method.

    Hai Rui's incorruptibility and his courage to struggle were beneficial to the people and gained their support in that society. In feudal society, the presence of a clean official brought immense happiness to the peasants. Therefore, peasants have endlessly praised historical clean officials, hoping for more Bao Qingtian, and Bao Gong plays have always been the most popular and well-known in rural areas. Peasants praise and admire officials who have done some good things for them and redressed even a little bit of their grievances. During the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, there was a man named Zeng Jiqu in my hometown of Lian County who became the prefect. He was an honest official and did some good things for the people, so the countryside praised him endlessly. When I was a child, I heard the elders say that when this honest official left office, all the families in the city placed a bowl of clean water at their doors and saw him off with tears.

    Clean officials are the hope of the vast number of peasants in feudal society, and peasants praising clean officials is an accusation against corrupt officials.

    Comrade Yao Wenyuan said that it was impossible for peasants to wear white and mourning when Hai Rui died because they didn't have money to buy white cloth. This is also a mechanical view. Of course, in feudal society, the lives of peasants were extremely difficult. However, we cannot mechanically think that peasants in feudal society were just like ordinary cattle and horses, with no agency at all. If we follow Comrade Yao Wenyuan's statement, then it would have been impossible for peasants to support our revolutionary troops during our decades of revolutionary struggle. Because the peasants themselves were not well-fed or clothed, where would they have gotten the grain and shoes to support the revolutionary troops fighting guerrilla warfare? Then, those who sent grain and shoes must have been landlords and rich peasants. Wouldn't that be too absurd?

    Therefore, analyzing and viewing the peasants of feudal society should not be too simplistic. Although the peasants of that time were oppressed by landlords and lived like cattle and horses, they would still survive and develop in resistance, and carry out certain actions according to their own will (of course, they would also be suppressed by the rulers). Peasants wearing white and mourning after Hai Rui's death was an action of peasants opposing and accusing feudal oppression and corrupt and cruel officials.

    Promoting Hai Rui's incorruptibility, fearlessness of death, and lack of desire for personal gain is of positive significance. We oppose corruption and excessive occupation, advocate fairness, not for fame, not for profit, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and dare to fight against bad people and bad deeds. We also need the spirit of Hai Rui. Of course, we mainly promote and praise good people and good deeds in the new society, but using the past for the present, using some deeds of the ancients to educate newcomers, also has a certain significance.

    对评价清官问题的几点意见
    张志廉
    提要清官是农民的希望。农民歌颂清官，是对贪官污吏的控诉。我们需要海瑞精神。
    有些同志说，旧社会的清官都是统治者的忠实走狗，是统治阶级出现危机时出来维护反动统治的。这种人比贪官酷吏更阴险更坏。他们的行动起到了缓和阶级矛盾、抑止农民革命的作用，阻碍了社会的发展，因而不能宣扬歌颂。这是一种机械的看法。试问：如果照这种说法，我们不是就要歌颂贪官酷吏了吗？因为贪官酷吏压迫人民最厉害。有压迫就有反抗，压迫得愈厉害就反抗得愈厉害，从而就会出现大的革命行动，就会推动社会的向前发展。这样，贪官酷吏就成为社会发展的大功臣了。这不是颠倒黑白，宣传邪恶吗？
    社会的发展，有其极其复杂的因素。当然，社会的发展只能通过人民的斗争。各种反抗斗争，尤其是武装推翻反动统治的斗争，使社会向前发展。但是认识这一规律，还是在马克思主义以后的事情。不能说海瑞这个人在明朝这个封建社会里，就有了认识这个规律的头脑，因而自觉地去缓和阶级矛盾，阻止革命的产生，以维护反动的封建统治。所以我们要历史地肯定或否定古人的品行，不能武断地说封建时代就没有同情人民的官吏。否则就是把封建社会看得过于简单，不是用辩证的方法分析和看待封建社会。
    海瑞为官清廉，敢于斗争，这在当时的社会里是有利于人民，得到人民拥护的。在封建社会里有了清官，农民感到莫大的幸福。所以农民对历史上的清官称颂不绝，希望包青天越多越好，包公戏历来在农村最受欢迎，家喻户晓。农民对于为他们做了一些好事、出了一点半点冤气的官吏，都是颂扬和爱戴的。前清光绪年间，在我的家乡连县，有一个叫曾纪渠的做了州正堂。他为官清廉，给人民做了一些好事，所以乡间称颂不绝。我小时还听老人说，当这个清官卸任时，全城百姓，家家在门口摆清水一碗，流泪相送。
    清官是封建社会广大农民的希望，农民歌颂清官就是对贪官酷吏的控诉。
    姚文元同志说，农民在海瑞死时穿白戴孝根本不可能，因为农民没有钱买白布。这也是一种机械的看法。当然在封建社会里，农民的生活是极其艰苦的。但是，我们也不能机械地认为封建社会的农民只是和一般牛马一样，毫无作为。如果按照姚文元同志的说法，那么在过去我们几十年的革命斗争中，农民支援我们的革命部队都是不可能的。因为农民本身吃不饱、没有穿，那里会有粮食、鞋子支援革命部队打游击呢？那么，送粮食、送鞋子的一定是地主富农了。这样不是太荒谬了吗？
    所以说分析和看待封建社会的农民也不要太简单。当时的农民虽然受着地主的压迫，过着如牛如马的生活，但是他们还会在反抗中生存发展，并根据自己的意志进行某些行动（当然也要受到统治者压制）。海瑞死后农民穿白戴孝，就是农民反对和控诉封建压迫、贪官酷吏的一种行动。
    宣扬海瑞为官清廉，不怕死、不图利，这是有积极意义的。我们反对贪污多占，提倡办事公道，不为名，不为利，一心为革命，一心为人民，敢于同坏人坏事作斗争，也需要海瑞精神。当然，我们主要是宣传歌颂新社会的好人好事，但古为今用，用一点古人的事迹教育新人，也有一定意义。
