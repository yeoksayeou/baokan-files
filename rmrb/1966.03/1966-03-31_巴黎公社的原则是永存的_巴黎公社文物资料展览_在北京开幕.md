    The Principles of the Paris Commune are Everlasting
    "Exhibition of Artifacts and Materials of the Paris Commune" Opens in Beijing
    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The "Exhibition of Artifacts and Materials of the Paris Commune," sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, opened this afternoon at the Beijing Exhibition Center.
    The nearly four hundred artifacts and materials of the Paris Commune on display are divided into five sections: "Armed Uprising," "Proletarian Dictatorship," "Heroic Battles," "Internationalist Spirit," and "Everlasting Revolutionary Principles." The preface to the exhibition includes a quote from Marx: "The workers' Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class."
    The artifacts and materials on display are from the collection of British friends Mr. and Mrs. S.G. Hawkins. Hawkins' father left him a batch of artifacts and materials about the Paris Commune, and he himself began collecting them at the age of fifteen. To collect more materials, Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins visited Paris several times.
    The paintings on display attracted people's attention. Filled with enthusiasm, the artists praised the heroic struggles of the Parisian proletarians after the March 18th, 1871 uprising against the troops of Thiers, the head of the traitorous French government, as well as the inspiring scene of the insurgent fighters raising their weapons and hailing the establishment of the first proletarian regime in human history. The exhibition also featured bronze badges bearing the words "Commune Republic," silver coins minted after the establishment of the Commune, battle knives used by the Communards, the account book of a company of the National Guard, and newspapers reporting on various activities of the Commune.
    After its establishment, the Paris Commune issued a series of decrees to destroy the old state machinery and improve the living and working conditions of the working people. The exhibition includes decrees on the establishment of the National Guard, improving the working conditions of bakery workers, abolishing high salaries, and separating religion and state. Also on display is a statement issued by the "Central Committee of the Women's Alliance for the Defense of Paris and Aid to the Wounded" in response to the Versailles bandits' conspiracy to engage in "peace talks." The statement said: "No, the working women of Paris do not demand this kind of peace, but to fight to the end! Today, reconciliation is betrayal!"
    Some paintings and pictures also recorded the heroic deeds of the Communard fighters in their desperate battles with the Versailles bandits during the last week of the Commune's existence. The exhibition featured a picture of the famous "Wall of the Communards," where the last group of Communard fighters put up a staunch resistance and all died heroically. People can also see here a portrait of Louise Michel, the heroine of the Paris Commune. This heroine, after the failure of the Commune, faced the judges in court with her head held high and said: "...I am proud to have participated in the founding of the Commune. If you leave me alive, I will never stop calling for revenge; if you are not cowards, then kill me!" All these exhibits left a deep impression on the audience, who saw from here that the development process of the Paris Commune was always full of life-and-death struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, revolution and counter-revolution.
      "The principles of the Commune are everlasting." This is Marx's great prediction of ninety-five years ago. The exhibition hall displays a replica of the minutes of Marx's speech at the General Council of the First International in 1871, in which the above famous saying of Marx was written. People also saw here a replica of the manuscript of "The Internationale," as well as artifacts and materials such as books and stamps from proletarian fighters of various countries congratulating the birth of the Paris Commune and praising the principles of the Commune.
    When the exhibition opened today, Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins, who were invited to visit our country, along with Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Xu Binu, Deputy Curator of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, and people from all walks of life in the capital, viewed the exhibition. Seeing the enthusiastic attendance of the audience in the capital at the exhibition hall, the white-haired Hawkins was very moved and couldn't help but shed tears.
    After being exhibited in the capital for a week, these artifacts and materials will be transported to Shanghai for exhibition.

    巴黎公社的原则是永存的
    “巴黎公社文物资料展览”在北京开幕
    新华社三十日讯  由中国人民对外文化协会主办的“巴黎公社文物资料展览”，今天下午在北京展览馆开幕。
    展出的巴黎公社文物资料有近四百件，分“武装起义”、“无产阶级专政”、“浴血战斗”、“国际主义精神”和“革命原则永存”五部分。展出的前言中有马克思的语录：“工人的巴黎及其公社将永远作为新社会的光辉的先驱受人敬仰。它的英烈们已永远铭记在工人阶级的伟大心坎里。”
    展出的文物资料，是英国朋友斯·哥·霍金斯夫妇收藏的。霍金斯的父亲曾给他遗留下一批关于巴黎公社的文物资料，他本人从十五岁起就开始收集。为了收集更多的资料，霍金斯夫妇曾数次到过巴黎。
    展览会上陈列的一幅幅绘画，吸引了人们的注意。绘画的作者怀着满腔的热情，歌颂了巴黎无产者在一八七一年三月十八日起义以后，同法国卖国政府首脑梯也尔的军队，浴血奋战的情景，以及起义战士高举武器，欢呼人类历史上第一个无产阶级政权宣告成立的激动人心的场面。展览会上还陈列着写有“公社共和国”字样的铜质徽章，公社成立后铸造的银币，公社社员使用的战刀，国民自卫军一个连队的账本，以及报道公社各项活动的报刊等。
    巴黎公社成立后，发布了一系列为摧毁旧的国家机器和改善劳动人民生活和工作条件的法令。这里展出的就有关于成立国民自卫军、改善面包房工人工作条件、废除高工薪以及关于宗教和国家分离等法令。这里还陈列着“保卫巴黎和救护伤员妇女同盟中央委员会”回答凡尔赛匪徒玩弄“和谈”阴谋所发表的声明。声明中说：“不，巴黎的劳动妇女所要求的不是这种和平，而是战斗到底！在今天，媾和就是背叛！”
    一些绘画和图片还记下了公社战士在公社存在的最后一周，同凡尔赛匪徒进行殊死战斗的英雄事迹。会上展出了有名的“公社社员墙”图片，当年在这堵墙下，最后的一批公社战士进行了坚决抵抗，全部壮烈牺牲。人们在这里还可以看到巴黎公社的女英雄路易丝·米歇尔的象片。这位女英雄在公社失败后，昂首对着法庭上的法官说：“……我因参加创立公社而感到自豪。假如你们留下我这条命，我决不停止呼吁报仇，假如你们不是胆小鬼，那就杀死我吧！”所有这些展品给观众留下了深刻的印象，人们从这里看到巴黎公社的发展过程，始终充满了无产阶级与资产阶级、革命与反革命的生死搏斗。
      “公社的原则是永存的”。这是马克思在九十五年前的伟大预言。展览厅内陈列着马克思一八七一年在第一国际总委员会上发言记录的复制品，这个记录中就写下了马克思的上述名言。人们在这里还看到了《国际歌》谱曲手稿复制品，以及各国无产阶级战士祝贺巴黎公社诞生和歌颂公社原则的书刊、邮票等文物和资料。
    展览在今天开幕的时候，应邀来我国访问的霍金斯夫妇同对外文协会长楚图南，中国革命博物馆副馆长徐彬如，以及首都各界人士，观看了展览。满头白发的霍金斯在展览厅看到首都观众踊跃前来参观的情况，非常感动，不禁流下眼泪。
    这些文物资料在首都展出一周后，还将运到上海展出。
