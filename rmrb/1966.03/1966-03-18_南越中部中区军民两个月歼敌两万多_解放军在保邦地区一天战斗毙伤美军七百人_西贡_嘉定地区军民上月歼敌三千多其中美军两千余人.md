    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th—In the first two months of this year, the American aggressors and their lackeys suffered unprecedentedly heavy defeats on the battlefields of the Central Trung Zone in South Vietnam. According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in the battles fought by the armymen and civilians of this region in the first two months of this year, according to incomplete statistics, a total of over 20,000 enemy troops were annihilated, including over 8,000 American aggressor troops and over 3,500 South Korean mercenary troops; 500 enemy planes were shot down or destroyed, and hundreds were damaged.
    In these two months, the American and puppet troops launched more than 20 “sweeps” with forces of two battalions or more towards the liberated areas in the plains of the Central Trung Zone, but each time they were smashed by the heroic armymen and civilians of the Central Trung Zone. The places where the enemy’s “sweeps” were most savage and on the largest scale were also the places where they suffered the most disastrous defeats. In the northern region of Binh Dinh Province, local armymen and civilians smashed the “sweep” conducted by 20 battalions of enemy troops from January 27 to February 21, annihilating over 5,000 enemy troops, including 3,000 American aggressor troops and 400 South Korean mercenary troops. In Phu Yen Province, from January 19 to February 19, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated a total of 1,078 American troops, 1,288 South Korean mercenary troops, and 283 puppet troops. In Quang Ngai Province, from January 27 to February 27, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated 1,266 American troops and 773 puppet troops.
    In addition to bravely carrying out counter-"sweeps," the main forces, local forces, and guerrillas of the Central Trung Zone Liberation Armed Forces also frequently and proactively surrounded enemy strongholds, ambushed enemies on transportation lines, and repeatedly launched surprise attacks on enemy nests with a very courageous and tenacious fighting spirit. Battles such as the attack on the American First Cavalry Division's base at An Khe, the surprise attack on Da Nang Airport, and Norman Airport all caused the enemy to lose their courage and suffer heavy losses.
    These brilliant achievements of the armymen and civilians in the Central Trung Zone further prove that the armymen and civilians of South Vietnam have sufficient strength to repel any enemy "sweep," and are fully capable of defeating any type of American army and smashing the "air superiority" boasted by the United States.
    The report said that while fiercely attacking the enemy on the battlefield, the people of various regions in the Central Trung Zone also launched large-scale political struggles to protest the heinous crimes committed by the American and puppet troops and the South Korean mercenary troops. They also achieved great success in the work of disintegrating the enemy army.
    The report said that at present, the armymen and civilians of various provinces in the Central Trung Zone are continuing to vigorously promote the "Anti-American National Salvation Competition" movement, concentrating all their efforts to strike and annihilate the enemy, and strive for greater new victories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th—According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces killed or wounded 700 aggressor troops of the American First Infantry Division in the battle in the Bao Bang area of ​​Thu Dau Mot Province on March 5, and shot down one American F-105 jet fighter and one helicopter.
    On March 4 and 5, the Quang Ngai Provincial Liberation Armed Forces fought fiercely with thousands of American and puppet troops in Vinh Loc Commune, Dong Giap Commune, and Hill 62 for two days, eliminating eight companies of American aggressor troops and 220 puppet troops, shooting down 20 enemy planes, destroying 12 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, and seizing a large number of weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th—According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in the battles with the enemy in February, the armymen and civilians of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam annihilated a total of 3,395 enemy troops, including 2,342 American troops.
    In the 180 battles carried out by the Liberation Armed Forces in this area in February, they also shot down five American planes, hit many others, destroyed 15 military vehicles, and damaged 30.
    The most beautiful battles fought by the armymen and civilians in this area in February were: the February 17 attack on the South Vietnamese puppet army's General Staff Headquarters near Tan Son Nhut Airport, annihilating 100 puppet troops and 30 American troops; and the anti-"sweep" battle in Qui Duc Commune, Gia Dinh Province, on February 27, killing and wounding 658 American and puppet troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th—Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces heavily shelled the enemy's airport near Cao Lanh City, Sa Dec Province, about 100 kilometers southwest of Saigon, with mortars in the early hours of the 17th.
    According to Western news agencies, the shelling lasted for more than two hours, "mortar shells rained down on the runway," and the puppet troops guarding the airport were in chaos and suffered casualties. At the same time, the puppet troops stationed in Cao Lanh City were also attacked.
    It was also reported that on the 16th, the Liberation Armed Forces blew up an important highway bridge about 50 kilometers southwest of Saigon, paralyzing the highway that transports grain to Saigon.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th—According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Quang Nam Provincial Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam launched a surprise attack on the American airport in Tam Ky City at 2:00 a.m. on February 28, killing over 100 American aggressors, including many officers from the American field command, and wounding many others.
    Three battalions of the American Marine Corps commanded by an American Major General and their field command recently suffered successive defeats in the "sweeps" against Tien Phuoc County and Tam Ky County in Quang Nam Province, and withdrew to the American airport in Tam Ky City on February 27. That night, the Liberation Armed Forces secretly and rapidly crossed the enemy's outposts around Tam Ky City and broke into the American airport in Tam Ky City. At 2:00 a.m. the next day, the Liberation Armed Forces suddenly launched a strong offensive against the American field command and the American camp simultaneously with machine guns, grenades, and hand grenades. After a short period of fighting, the Liberation Armed Forces completely destroyed the three American tents, killing more than 100 American aggressors on the spot and wounding many others.
    According to another report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in the battle in which the Gia Dinh Provincial Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam attacked the 4th Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the puppet army's 5th Division in the areas of Tan Hoa and Tan Quy on February 27, an entire company was annihilated, 47 enemies were killed, 23 were wounded, and 30 were captured.

    南越中部中区军民两个月歼敌两万多
    解放军在保邦地区一天战斗毙伤美军七百人
    西贡—嘉定地区军民上月歼敌三千多其中美军两千余人
    新华社河内十六日电　今年头两个月，美国侵略者和它的走狗在越南南方中部中区的战场上，遭到了空前惨重的失败。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，这个地区的军民在今年头两个月的战斗中，据不完全统计，共歼敌两万多名，其中包括美国侵略军八千多名，南朝鲜帮凶军三千五百多名；击落击毁敌机五百架，击伤成百架。
    这两个月中，美伪军向中部中区的平原解放区展开了二十多次兵力在两个营以上的“扫荡”，但是，每一次都被英勇的中部中区军民粉碎。在敌人“扫荡”最野蛮、规模最大的地方，也是它们失败最惨重的地方。在平定省北部地区，当地军民粉碎了二十个营敌军从一月二十七日到二月二十一日进行的“扫荡”，歼敌五千多名，其中包括美国侵略军三千名，南朝鲜帮凶军四百名。在富安省，从一月十九日到二月十九日，解放武装力量共歼灭美军一千零七十八名，南朝鲜帮凶军一千二百八十八名，伪军二百八十三名，在广义省，从一月二十七日到二月二十七日，解放武装力量歼灭美军一千二百六十六名，伪军七百七十三名。
    中部中区解放武装力量的主力部队、地方部队和游击队除了英勇进行反“扫荡”外，又以十分勇敢和坚韧的战斗精神，经常主动地包围敌人的据点，在交通线上伏击敌人，并且接连奇袭敌人的巢穴。如袭击美国第一骑兵师的老巢安溪基地、奇袭岘港机场和诺曼机场等战斗，都使敌人丧魂落魄，损失惨重。
    中部中区军民的这些辉煌战绩，更加证明了越南南方军民有足够的力量击退敌人任何一次“扫荡”，并且完全有能力打败美国任何类型的军队和粉碎美国所吹嘘的“空中优势”。
    报道说，中部中区军民在战场上猛烈打击敌人的同时，各地人民还展开了声势浩大的政治斗争，抗议美伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军犯下的各种滔天罪行。他们在瓦解敌军的工作方面也取得了很大的成绩。
    报道说，目前，中部中区各省军民正在继续大力促进“抗美救国竞赛”运动，集中全力打击和消灭敌人，争取更大的新胜利。
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方解放武装力量三月五日在土龙木省保邦地区的战斗中，共打死、打伤美国第一步兵师的侵略军七百人，击落美国F—105型喷气式战斗机和直升飞机各一架。
    广义省解放武装力量三月四日和五日两天，在永禄乡、同甲乡和六二高地同数千名美伪军激战，共消灭美国侵略军八个连和伪军二百二十人，并击落敌机二十架，击毁M—113型两栖装甲车十二辆，缴获大批武器。
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区军民二月份在同敌人的战斗中，共歼敌三千三百九十五人，其中包括美军二千三百四十二人。
    这个地区的解放武装力量在二月份进行的一百八十次战斗中，还击落美国飞机五架，击中多架，击毁军车十五辆，击坏三十辆。
    这个地区的军民在二月份打得最漂亮的几次战斗是：二月十七日袭击新山一机场附近的南越伪军总参谋部，歼灭伪军一百人，美军三十人；二月二十七日在嘉定省归德乡的反“扫荡”战斗中，打死、打伤美伪军六百五十八人。
    新华社十七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十七日凌晨用迫击炮猛烈轰击西贡西南约一百公里的沙沥省高岭市附近的敌军机场。
    据西方通讯社报道，炮轰持续了两个多小时，“迫击炮弹雨点般地落到了跑道上”，守卫机场的伪军一片混乱，遭到了伤亡。和这同时，驻守在高岭市的伪军也受到了袭击。
    另据报道，解放武装力量十六日炸毁了西贡西南约五十公里地方的一座重要公路桥梁，使这条为西贡运送粮食的公路陷于瘫痪。
    据新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省解放武装力量，二月二十八日凌晨二时奇袭三岐市美军机场，打死美国侵略者一百多名，其中有美军野战指挥部军官多名，打伤多名。
    由一名美国少将指挥的美国海军陆战队三个营及其野战指挥部最近在对广南省先福县和三岐县进行“扫荡”接连遭到失败后，二月二十七日撤回三岐市美军机场。当天晚上，解放武装力量就秘密和快速地越过敌人在三岐市外围的各个据点，突入三岐市美军机场。第二天凌晨二时，解放武装力量用机枪、手雷和手榴弹，突然向美军野战指挥部和美军营地同时发起强烈进攻。经过短时间的战斗，解放武装力量就完全摧毁了美军三个篷帐，当场打死美国侵略者一百多名，打伤多名。
    另据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉定省解放武装力量二月二十七日在新和和新贵地区袭击伪军第五师第七团第四营的战斗中，全歼一个连，打死敌人四十七名，打伤二十三名，俘虏三十名。这个伪军团的少校副团长当场被打死。
