    Small Poems on Increasing Production and Practicing Economy (Two Poems)
    Worker of Luoyang First Tractor Plant: Dong Zhenguo
    Outside the windows of the pledge rally for practicing economy,
    	The north wind howls,
    Inside the workshop,
    	Heat surges,
    The letters of determination are like evening glow,
    	Reddening the early spring dusk.
    The young men are all eager to try,
    	You can clearly hear the sound of their hearts beating;
    The girls are discussing and thinking of ways,
    	Joy is written on each of their faces.
    The master worker expresses his ambition at the meeting,
    	His words are like a ten-ton steam hammer striking the anvil;
    The Youth League Secretary speaks on behalf of the shock brigade:
    	We must build the country diligently and thriftily and rely on our own efforts.
    The meeting is over, the crowd pours out of the workshop,
    	Like a surging flood breaking through the floodgates;
    The meeting is over, each rushes towards their destination,
    	Using skillful hands to restore the "waste" to its youth.
    Waiting for the day when the morning sun rises in the east,
    	The sound of whistles will spread the good news:
    Washed cotton yarn is like silver flowers blooming,
    	Ah, the recycled steel, its brilliance shines.
    
    Master Liu, the "Economy Fanatic,"
    "Economy Fanatic," his resounding name flies throughout the factory;
    He has spread the "gospel" to Beijing,
    	And met Chairman Mao at a conference.
    A happy life does not come easily,
    	Each bit of property must be cherished!
    In the wind, he closes the workshop windows;
    In the rain, he wraps the machines in cotton quilts.
    A ball of yarn, in his eyes, becomes a cotton mountain;
    A nail, picked up in his hand, transforms into a machine;
    A piece of coal, in front of him, is a furnace of fire;
    A drop of oil, in his heart, becomes a river!
    People say he is a piece of steel,
    	His revolutionary red heart is incomparably hard;
    I say he is a good housekeeper,
    	A red banner of the proletariat!

    增产节约小诗（二首）
    洛阳第一拖拉机厂工人　董振国
    节约誓师会窗户外，朔风阵阵，车间内，热流滚滚，决心书象片片晚霞，染红了初春的黄昏。小伙子个个磨拳擦掌，听得清他们跳动的心音；姑娘们低头议论想办法，她们个个脸上露出欢欣。老师傅在会上表雄心，话语象十吨汽锤敲击铁砧；团支书代表突击队发言：一定要勤俭建国自力更生。会散了，人流涌出车间，象奔腾的洪水冲开闸门；会散了，各自奔向目的地，用巧手恢复“废物”的青春。待等来日朝阳东升，声声汽笛将传出佳音：洗净的棉纱象银花朵朵，回收的钢铁啊，光采照人。
    “节约迷”刘师傅，“节约迷”，响当当名字全厂飞；传“经”到过北京城，开会见过毛主席。幸福的生活来不易呵，财产点滴要珍惜！风里，他关上车间玻璃窗；雨里，他用棉被裹机器。一团纱，望在眼里成棉山；一颗钉，拣在手里化机器；一块炭，在他面前一炉火；一滴油，在他心里汇成渠！人说他是一块钢，革命红心硬无比；我说他是个好管家，无产阶级的一杆红旗！
