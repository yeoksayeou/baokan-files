	Two New Parts for Automobiles
	The Shanghai Automotive Electrical Machinery Factory has recently produced two new products: a silicon semiconductor rectifier generator for automobiles and a fully transistorized voltage regulator.
	The common characteristics of these two new products are small size, light weight, good performance, long service life, and convenient maintenance.
	Those who participated in the design and trial production of these two new products were Meng Jinrong, Zhou Zhongpei, and Jin Xingtao, technicians from worker backgrounds and graduates of half-work, half-study industrial universities. They originally did not understand semiconductor technology. However, they firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, closely combined the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act with a pragmatic scientific attitude, and conscientiously learned from scratch. Together with engineer Chen Sisun, they went deep into the field, conducted experiments with the workers, repeatedly explored, found parameters not yet seen in books, provided important data for the design of silicon semiconductor rectifier generator series products, and created new types of generator semiconductor components. They also used indigenous methods and made-do methods to create the equipment necessary for trial production of new products. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    两种供汽车用的新部件
    上海汽车电机厂最近又制成两种新产品——汽车用的硅半导体整流发电机和全晶体管电压调节器。
    这两种新产品的共同特点是体积小，重量轻，性能好，使用寿命长，而且维护方便。
    参加设计试制这两种新产品的，是工人出身的技术员、半工半读工业大学毕业生孟金荣、周仲培和金兴涛。他们原来并不懂半导体技术。但是他们牢记着毛主席的教导，把敢想敢干的革命精神同求实的科学态度紧密结合起来，老老实实从头学起。他们同工程师陈思舜一起，深入现场，跟工人一道进行试验，反复摸索，找到了书本上还没有看到的参数，为设计硅半导体整流发电机系列产品提供了重要数据，造出了新型发电机半导体元件。还用土办法、穷办法，造出了试制新产品必需的设备。　（据新华社讯）
