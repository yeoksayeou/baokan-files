    Latin America is in the Midst of Intense Turmoil
    American Newspapers Worry that a New Anti-American Storm Will Rise on the Latin American Continent
    (Our Newspaper Combined Reports) Many American newspapers have recently published articles continuously, increasingly uneasy about the anti-American waves rising one after another in Latin America. They exclaim: "Latin America is transforming today due to intense revolutionary turmoil." "Discovering a volatile continent is gradually heading towards a real crisis and trouble." These reports show that today's Latin America is in a major revolutionary upheaval, and a new and greater anti-American storm is about to appear on the land of Latin America.
    The *Christian Science Monitor* published an article entitled *The Hemisphere in Deep Turmoil*, saying:
      "Latin America is a hemisphere of young people. More than half of Latin America's 250 million people are under the age of twenty. Population growth is three percent, making this region the fastest-growing in the world." "How to feed, clothe, and house these young people, how to educate them, and how to find them jobs when they grow up are the real challenges today."
    The newspaper revealed that under the barbaric plunder and exploitation of Latin America by American imperialism, Latin American farmers are increasingly going bankrupt and have to be forced to move to cities to live an inhuman life, resulting in the abnormal development of Latin American countries. It says: "Latin Americans are quickly becoming city dwellers, which is a new development. In most countries, large numbers of people are now moving to cities, so the cities are messy and full of slums. This development further increases social pressure. Almost half of the Latin American population is concentrated in forty urban areas, including Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Lima, and Caracas."
    "Due to population growth, the useful labor force is rapidly increasing. By 1975, the labor force will increase by 40 million. However, at the current employment rate, only 5 million new jobs can be created by then. Even now, unemployment is an important factor in most countries."
    The situation is also very serious in agriculture. The newspaper says: "This hemisphere is not currently producing the food it can produce. Although the total production has increased in the past ten years, the food production per person in this hemisphere has slightly decreased at the same time." "The economies of most Latin American countries are still based on raw material exports and single products."
      "In many countries, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened rather than narrowed."
      "These factors illustrate the size of the social and economic problems in Latin America. These problems are developing in most countries."
    This newspaper had to exclaim: "The threat of communism has entered this boiling pot." "Communism is currently spreading the seeds of discontent, which the Communist Party has failed to do in the past four decades. These seeds may bear bad fruit in later years."
    The increasingly high tide of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Latin American people is directly aimed at American imperialism. The anti-American struggle is a sign of the awakening of the Latin American people. Now the anti-American sentiment in Latin America is becoming stronger and stronger. *The New York Herald Tribune* published an article by columnist Walter Lippmann, admitting, "For some time it has been clear that our relationship with Latin America is deteriorating. During my recent visit to South America, I found that almost everywhere, from top to bottom, from right to left, there is a general distrust and suspicion of the Johnson administration, and a very widespread anti-American sentiment."
    An article in *The Washington Evening Star* entitled *Latin American Noise* said that Latin Americans realize that "they are 'sardines' constantly being economically swallowed by the northern 'big shark'." The article said that Rusk and Robert Kennedy being attacked with eggs, stones, and spat upon in Latin America at the end of last year showed that "a deep spiritual rift still divides the United States from other countries in this hemisphere. This may ultimately be more dangerous than any secret arsenal and ammunition factory that the Communist Party can possess." The newspaper pointed out that "we will face more stormy days in this hemisphere in the future."

### 拉丁美洲正处在激烈的动荡中  美报担心一个新的反美大风暴将在拉丁美洲大陆上兴起

    拉丁美洲正处在激烈的动荡中
    美报担心一个新的反美大风暴将在拉丁美洲大陆上兴起
    本报综合报道：许多美国报纸最近连续发表文章，对拉丁美洲此起彼伏的反美浪潮日益不安。它们惊呼：“拉丁美洲今天由于激烈的革命动乱而正在转变中。”“发现一个动荡不定的大陆正在逐渐走向真正的危机和麻烦。”从这些报道可以看出，今天的拉丁美洲正处于革命的大动荡中，一个新的更大的反美风暴即将出现在拉丁美洲的土地上。
    《基督教科学箴言报》刊登了一篇题为《处于深刻动乱中的本半球》的文章说：
      “拉丁美洲是一个青年人的半球。拉丁美洲的二亿五千万人的一半以上在二十岁以下。人口的增长为百分之三，这使这个地区成为世界上人口增长最快的地方。”“如何使这些青年人吃饱穿暖住好，如何教育他们，在他们长大成人后如何为他们找到职业，是今天真正的挑战。”
    报纸透露，在美帝国主义对拉丁美洲进行野蛮的掠夺和剥削下，拉丁美洲农民日益破产，不得不被迫流入城市过着非人的生活，造成了拉丁美洲国家畸形的发展。它说：“拉丁美洲人很快在变成城市居民，这是一个新发展。在大多数国家中现在大批人移居城市，因此城市里乱七八糟，到处是贫民窟。这种发展进一步加重了社会的压力。拉丁美洲人口的几乎一半集中在四十个城市地区，包括墨西哥城，里约热内卢、圣保罗、布宜诺斯艾利斯、利马和加拉加斯。
    “由于人口增长，有用的劳动力迅速增加。到一九七五年劳动力将增加四千万人。但是，按照目前的就业率，到那时只能创造出五百万个新职务。即使现在，在大多数国家中失业也是个重要因素。”
    在农业方面，情况也十分严重。报纸说：“本半球目前没有生产它能生产的粮食。虽然生产总数在过去十年增加了，但在同时本半球每人的粮食生产量却稍有下降。”“大多数拉丁美洲国家的经济仍然建筑在原料出口和单一产品的基础上。”
      “在许多国家中，有钱人和穷人之间的差别扩大了而不是缩小了。”
      “这些因素说明拉丁美洲的社会和经济问题的大小。这些问题在大多数国家正在发展。”
    这家报纸不得不惊呼：“共产主义的威胁已进入了这个沸腾的大锅。”“共产主义目前正在散布不满的种子，这是过去四十年共产党未能做的。这些种子可能在以后几年产生恶果。”
    拉丁美洲人民日益高涨的反帝斗争，其矛头是直接指向美帝国主义的。反美斗争正是拉丁美洲人民觉醒的一个标志。现在在拉丁美洲反美的情绪是愈来愈强烈了。《纽约先驱论坛报》刊登专栏作家李普曼写的一篇文章承认，“一个时期以来很明显，我们同拉丁美洲的关系在日益恶化。我在最近访问南美时发现，差不多每个地方，从上到下、从右到左，对约翰逊政府存在普遍的不信任和怀疑，并存在一种十分广泛的反美情绪”。
    《华盛顿明星晚报》的一篇题为《拉丁美洲的吵闹声》的文章说，拉丁美洲人认识到“他们是不断被北方‘大鲨鱼’在经济上吞掉的‘沙丁鱼’”。文章说，腊斯克和罗伯特·肯尼迪去年末在拉丁美洲挨鸡蛋、石头袭击和被吐唾沫一事，表明“一种深刻的精神裂缝仍然把美国同本半球其他国家分裂开来。这最终可能比共产党能够拥有的任何秘密军火库和弹药厂危险得多”。这家报纸指出，“今后我们在这个半球面临更多暴风雨的日子”。
