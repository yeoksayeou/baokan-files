    This newspaper reports: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League released three typical experiences in Young Pioneer work on February 28th. They are: the experience of the Young Pioneer work of the Henglu Brigade in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, the experience of the Young Pioneer work of Dongmenli Primary School in Tianjin, and the experience of the Communist Youth League branch of the Gujiazi Brigade in Gaixian County, Liaoning Province in leading Young Pioneer work. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League requires local Communist Youth League organizations to study and refer to these three typical experiences in light of the actual conditions of their own localities and units.
    In its approval of these three typical examples, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League pointed out that since the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Communist Youth League organizations in various localities have conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on organizing all children and young people, and have actively established and developed Young Pioneer organizations. The number of Young Pioneers nationwide has reached 90 million, which is a great achievement. Our current task is to continue to vigorously develop Young Pioneer organizations, and at the same time, carry out Young Pioneer activities to fully utilize the Young Pioneers as a school for children to learn communism.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League said in its approval that at present, there are a number of well-run Young Pioneer organizations and a number of Communist Youth League branches that lead the Young Pioneers well throughout the country. The three typical examples released this time are such advanced units. According to Chairman Mao’s teachings, they proceed from the actual conditions of their own units and guide children and young people to establish revolutionary ideals, cultivate feelings for workers and peasants, and develop revolutionary and construction skills in the actual struggle of socialist revolution and construction. According to the characteristics and practical possibilities of children and young people, they comprehensively arrange reading, labor, sports, and recreational games, so that the team's activities are rich and colorful, and promote the lively, active, and initiative development of children and young people in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. They adhere to the principle of positive education and praise as the main thing, vigorously praise good ideas and good behaviors, form a good atmosphere in the Young Pioneers, and guide children and young people to continuously improve. They have established a democratic life system in the Young Pioneers, where everyone discusses and decides matters, so that members can learn to be masters of their own affairs and learn to live a life of democratic centralism. They implement the whole Communist Youth League leading the team, closely cooperate with the school, give full play to the role of counselors, and rely on the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants to jointly do a good job in the education of children and young people.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that Communist Youth League organizations in various localities will conscientiously and flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, and according to Chairman Mao’s instructions on the children's and youth movement, go deep into the grassroots, sum up experiences, establish and promote typical examples in various aspects of Young Pioneer work, and build up the work of the Young Pioneer large, medium, and small teams, so that China's new generation can better grow up and develop in this revolutionary organization.

    团中央发布少先队工作三个典型经验并提出当前任务
    继续大力发展少先队组织
    充分发挥少先队作为儿童们学习共产主义学校的作用
    本报讯  共青团中央在二月二十八日发布了少先队工作的三个典型经验。它们是：浙江临安县横路大队少先队工作的经验，天津市东门里小学少先队工作的经验，辽宁盖县古家子大队团支部领导少先队工作的经验。团中央要求各地团组织，结合本地本单位的实际情况，对这三个典型经验进行研究和参考。
    团中央在对这三个典型的批语中指出，团的九届二中全会以来，各地团组织认真执行了党中央和毛主席关于把全体少年儿童组织起来的指示，积极建立和发展少先队组织，全国少先队员已达九千万人，这是一个很大的成绩。我们现在的任务是：继续进行少先队组织的大发展，同时把少先队的活动开展起来，充分发挥少先队作为儿童们学习共产主义学校的作用。
    团中央在批语中说，目前，全国各地都有一批办得很好的少先队组织，也有一批领导少先队好的团支部。这次发布的三个典型，就是这样的先进单位。他们按照毛主席的教导，从本单位的实际条件出发，引导少年儿童在社会主义革命和建设的实际斗争中，树立革命理想，培养工农感情，锻炼革命和建设本领。他们根据少年儿童的特点和实际可能，全面安排读书、劳动、体育和娱乐游戏，使队的活动丰富多采，促进少年儿童在德智体诸方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展。他们坚持正面教育、表扬为主的原则，大力表扬好思想，好行为，在少先队里形成好风气，引导少年儿童不断进步。他们在少先队里建立了民主生活制度，有事大家商量、大家决定，让队员学习当家作主，学习过民主集中制生活。他们实行全团带队，与学校密切配合，充分发挥辅导员的作用，依靠工人阶级、贫下中农，共同做好少年儿童的教育工作。
    团中央希望各地团的组织认真活学活用毛主席著作，根据毛主席关于少年儿童运动的指示，深入基层，总结经验，树立和推广少先队工作各方面的典型，把少先队大、中、小队的工作建设起来，使我国新的一代在这个革命组织中更好地锻炼成长。
