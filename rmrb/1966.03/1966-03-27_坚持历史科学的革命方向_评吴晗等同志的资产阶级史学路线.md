    Adhere to the Revolutionary Direction of Historical Science
    —A Critique of the Bourgeois Historical Line of Comrade Wu Han and Others
    Shi Shaobin
    Abstract: A reactionary historical trend of thought represented by Comrade Wu Han desperately resisted the revolution in historical science and, on a series of fundamental issues, put forward a historical line that opposed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    Comrade Wu Han's so-called "era of great peace," which represented the "bright side of history," was nothing more than the landlord class's "peace," "prosperity," and "brightness." There was no fundamental consistency of interests between the peasant class and the landlord class. Comrade Wu Han and others' main weapon against Marxist theory was bourgeois "historicism."
    Comrade Wu Han opposed historical research following the guidance of the Party's policies and opposed historical science serving proletarian politics, intending to serve the restoration of the bourgeoisie. The path he wanted historical workers to take was a bourgeois path of detaching themselves from reality, detaching themselves from politics, burying themselves in ancient books, and pursuing personal fame and gain. All ambitious historical workers should go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and get covered in mud.

    Since 1958, with the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the increasing development of socialist construction, a profound revolution has been launched in China's historical circles. The current excellent situation urgently requires historical workers to hold high the critical banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, eliminate all feudal and bourgeois historical ideas, thoroughly break with the old historical traditions, and develop Marxist historical science.
    This great revolution in the field of history has been desperately resisted by those who adhere to the bourgeois historical direction. Because this revolution will break their monopoly on history and destroy the foundation upon which they base their lives, they are uneasy and curse it in every possible way, feeling "like a bone stuck in their throat," needing to speak out. A reactionary historical trend of thought represented by Comrade Wu Han has emerged. On a series of fundamental issues, such as what kind of history to write, what viewpoints and methods to use to guide the writing of history, for whom to write history, and by what kind of people to write history, they have put forward a historical line that opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, the struggle between two historical views, two methods, and two paths in the field of history has become more intense and acute.

          I. The Focus of the Current Struggle Between Two Historical Views
    The Twenty-Four Histories are full of the lies of the exploiting classes. For thousands of years, the history of class society has been written as the genealogy of emperors, generals, and ministers. The large and small heads of the exploiting classes, the executioners with hands stained with the blood of the people, have all been portrayed as "heroes" who created history. The masses of the people, on the other hand, have been slandered as "bandits," "robbers," and "rebels." History has been completely turned upside down. History has been controlled by the exploiting classes and has become their political tool for oppressing and deceiving the working people.
    Marxism exposed this historical deception and solemnly pointed out: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history."¹ Engels demanded that the proletariat use historical materialism as a guide to re-examine all history.² More than twenty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward the political task of "reversing this historical reversal"³ to our revolutionary literary and historical workers.
    Since liberation, the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of working people have become the masters of the country and, under the leadership of the Party, have been carrying out historical activities to transform the old world and build a new world. The current revolutionary creative activities of the masses of the people more profoundly embody the great truth that the working people are the masters of history. At the same time, our proletarian dictatorship state provides sufficient objective conditions for rewriting history. This situation prompts revolutionary historical workers to further explore and elaborate on the creative activities of the working people in history, encourage the revolutionary fighting spirit of the broad masses of the people, and realize the revolutionary task of rewriting all history proposed by the revolutionary teachers.
    However, some people, represented by Comrade Wu Han, oppose historical workers completing this revolutionary task. They write articles, make reports, and vigorously eulogize "wise rulers and virtuous ministers," tout "honest officials" and "good officials," and loudly proclaim: Defend emperors, generals, and ministers; defend the dynastic system. When Comrade Wu Han talked about the role of emperors, generals, and ministers in history, he said: "This should be viewed from two aspects. On the one hand, as Chairman Mao said, the masses of the people are the driving force of revolution, and peasant wars are the driving force of social development. But on the other hand, who played a leading role in a certain political measure, engineering construction, or large-scale war in past historical eras? It was the emperors, generals, and ministers in history who led and directed these tasks."⁴ Here, he played with eclectic tricks and arrogantly declared that Comrade Mao Zedong's basic viewpoint on historical materialism was only "one aspect," actually using his own "other aspect" to negate Comrade Mao Zedong's basic viewpoint. He also accused revolutionary historical workers of "trying hard to avoid eulogizing emperors, generals, and ministers, so as not to lose their position. As a result, except for Qin Shi Huang, they do not write about or rarely describe the leading figures of relatively prosperous eras such as Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, Kangxi, and Qianlong. Thus, the bright side of history is lost, and what is written in books is all about how bad this dynasty was, how peasant uprisings overthrew it, and how another dynasty rose up and was also bad, and how peasant uprisings overthrew it again. It is all about overthrowing, and history almost becomes pitch black and gloomy."⁵ In his view, we should not write about the history of the masses of the people at all, because poor peasants "have no achievements in their entire lives." Writing about them in history would make "history too much, too much to read, and would cancel out history."⁶
    Comrade Wu Han's malicious attack fully exposes his idealist view of history, which defends the exploiting classes. Revolutionary historical workers are not "trying hard to avoid eulogizing emperors, generals, and ministers" at all, but are thoroughly sweeping away the eulogies of emperors, generals, and ministers by the feudal ruling class and the bourgeoisie. We want to eulogize the masses of the people. Marxism has always acknowledged the historical role of outstanding figures. However, the outstanding figures mentioned by Comrade Wu Han are nothing more than emperors, generals, ministers, and men of letters and scholars. Comrade Wu Han cherishes deep feelings for these people and praises them highly; Marxists, on the other hand, firmly stand on the position of the proletariat and, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the people, conduct scientific analysis and evaluation, giving due historical status to outstanding figures who have indeed made contributions to historical development. However, the outstanding figures that revolutionary historical workers want to write about and enthusiastically eulogize should be the people's heroes who have long been slandered, distorted, and obliterated by the historians of the exploiting classes, such as Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, Huang Chao, Li Zicheng, and Hong Xiuquan, and others. Comrade Wu Han, however, holds traditional historical prejudices against these people, is full of disgust, and criticizes them verbally and in writing. Obviously, the differences between revolutionary historical workers and Comrade Wu Han are by no means limited to how to evaluate outstanding figures, but are: Who is the master of history, and what is the fundamental issue of the driving force of history.
    Thus, the question of whether to reverse the reversed history again has become the focus of the current struggle between the two historical views.

      II. Refuting the Two "Arguments" of the Defenders of Emperors, Generals, and Ministers
    Comrade Wu Han and others oppose reversing the reversed history again, saying that the reasons are nothing more than that emperors, generals, and ministers are "playing a role" in history, while peasants are "not playing a role." Where is the historical role of emperors, generals, and ministers manifested? It is said that: (1) the "era of great peace" they "cultivated" is the "bright side of history"; (2) they "consciously" did some so-called "good things" that were "consistent with the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class and also with the current interests of the broad masses of oppressed and exploited people." These two "arguments" are quite confusing to some people and need to be analyzed.
    The so-called "era of great peace" is a political model of feudal rule carefully shaped by feudal historians of past dynasties in accordance with Confucian ideas. They painted it as "gentlemen all enjoy their lives, common people are all content with their jobs, the strong do not bully the weak, the many do not oppress the few"; "prisons are often empty"; "the country is peaceful, no one picks up lost items on the road, doors are not closed at night, and merchants travel and sleep in the wild."⁷ In their writings, the contradictions and struggles between oppressors and the oppressed, exploiters and the exploited, are gone, and it is completely a beautiful scene of "peace and harmony from top to bottom," sharing peace. Comrade Wu Han reprocessed and concocted this feudal political model with a bourgeois viewpoint and greatly inflated it. The "era of great peace" mentioned by feudal historians is nothing more than the "Rule of Wen and Jing" and the "Reign of Zhenguan," etc. Comrade Wu Han believes that all periods ruled by his "good emperors" such as Cao Cao, Wu Zetian, Zhu Yuanzhang, and Kangxi are "peaceful times." Even if there is no "good emperor," if there is a "clean official" or "good official" somewhere, the "sky" there will also be "clear." Not only that, but he further concocted the absurd theory that the "era of great peace" represents the so-called "bright side of history."
    The Marxist class viewpoint tells us that in class society, there is no such thing as "peace" for all people, "prosperity" for all people, and "brightness" for all people. Whose "peace" is the "era of great peace" eulogized and embellished by Comrade Wu Han, whose "prosperity" is it, and whose "brightness" is it?
    From the point of view of class struggle, the so-called "era of great peace" is nothing more than the landlord class's "peace," the landlord class's "prosperity," and the landlord class's "brightness."
    The contradiction and opposition between the landlord class and the peasant class is the fundamental contradiction that runs through Chinese feudal society. To examine all historical phenomena and historical events of feudal society, we can only proceed from the movement, development, and changes of this fundamental contradiction to conduct a specific analysis. In the thousands of years of feudal society, the development of class struggle is wave-like, with high tides and low tides, showing stages. When the landlord class's cruel rule and exploitation force the peasants to rise up, the contradiction takes the form of external confrontation, and the class struggle reaches a climax; when the peasant uprising fails and is used by the landlord class as a tool for changing dynasties, the peasant's class struggle enters a low ebb period, and a temporary and relatively stable situation appears in the feudal rule. At this time, class contradictions and class struggles have not disappeared, but have only taken another form. As the ruling class's exploitation and oppression of the working people intensifies, class contradictions become more acute, feudal rule gradually falls into crisis from a relatively stable situation, and moves towards a total outbreak of contradictions, causing another large-scale peasant uprising, and the class struggle enters a climax period again. The so-called "era of great peace" often appears in this relatively stable period.
    For the landlord class, the "era of great peace" is the reorganization and strengthening of feudal rule. For the peasant class, it is the process of constantly being deprived of the fruits of revolutionary struggle, and the feudal shackles are put back on their bodies and gradually tightened. After large-scale peasant uprisings and peasant wars, the feudal dynasty established in the blood of peasants first consolidates and strengthens the dictatorship over the peasants, and implements various deceptive policies and coercive measures to plunder the working people, re-forcing the peasants who have broken free or partially broken free from feudal bondage to be fixed on the land, and placing them under the complete control of the feudal ruling class and the feudal dynasty, so as to ensure the source of corvée taxes, military strength, and all exploitation conditions. The policies of "restoring the old titles, land, and houses" in the early Western Han Dynasty, the "equal field system" in the early Tang Dynasty, and the "recruitment and appeasement of refugees" in the dynasties, although their specific methods are different, their essence and real purpose are all here.
    At the same time, the feudal dynasty actively supports new and old landlords and cultivates its own ruling foundation through "rewards" and the granting of privileges. The political and economic power of the landlord class is restored, developed, and strengthened again. We can see this phenomenon from the so-called "prosperous times" of the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties: The landlord class uses this relatively stable opportunity to massively annex and plunder the peasants' land, increase exploitation, and desperately squeeze the peasants' blood. Even feudal historians cannot completely hide this point. Du You once pointed out that "in the Kaiyuan period and since the Tianbao era," "the evils of annexation are more than those in the time of Emperor Cheng and Emperor Ai of Han."⁸ Therefore, the development process of the so-called "era of great peace" is precisely the process in which new and old bureaucrats, landlords, and nobles unite to attack the peasants and constantly increase the exploitation, oppression, and plunder of the peasants.
      Under the "prosperous times," on the one hand, the feudal state is rich, and the landlord class is rich. After seventy years of recuperation and rejuvenation in the early Han Dynasty, there appeared the so-called "money in the capital accumulated hundreds of millions," "grain in the imperial granary piled up layer upon layer"; Du Fu's saying "Recalling the full prosperity of the Kaiyuan era,... both public and private granaries were full and substantial" is a portrayal of this situation. The landlord class accumulated a large amount of wealth through oppression and exploitation, providing for their extravagant pleasure, and creating their "civil and military achievements" and "prosperity." On the other hand, the peasants are plunged back into the dark prison of feudal rule. Please see, the "Rule of Wen and Jing" that everyone talks about is: "If it does not rain at the right time, the people will look around like wolves," "the rich do not lend, and the poor will be hungry"; the "prosperous times" of Emperor Wu are: "The rich have fields stretching for miles, and the poor have no land to stand on," "the poor often wear the clothes of cattle and horses, and eat the food of dogs and pigs"; in the Zhenguan period, peasants "who are conscripted go and return with their brothers, one after another," and in order to avoid corvée, they "often break their limbs themselves, calling it 'lucky hands' and 'lucky feet'"; in the Kangxi period, "the poor have nothing to rely on, wives leave their husbands, children leave their fathers, and they often sigh that their lives are not as good as dogs and horses," "within the four seas, they are increasingly poor,... and the people of Wuzhong mostly sell their sons and daughters to distant places."⁹
      The "prosperous times" did not change the tragic life of the vast number of peasants in slavery. Therefore, the peasants' resistance to the landlord class did not stop, but the contradictions had not yet fully intensified. For example, in the Zhenguan period, "the area outside the sword gate was turbulent." In the period of Wu Zetian, who was praised by Comrade Wu Han as "the greatest woman in ancient times" who "ruled well," "more than half of the households in the country fled," and "bandits in Shandong gathered because of this."¹⁰ The peasants used their actions to expose the myth of the "era of great peace."
    The reason why feudal historians want to eulogize and embellish the "era of great peace" is to regard it as the feudal political ideal, to advise the rulers on how to achieve "long-term stability"; at the same time, they attempt to "appease" the peasants, paralyze their class consciousness and revolutionary fighting spirit, and induce them to yearn for this "era of great peace" and for "clean officials" and "good emperors." But for the vast number of poor peasants, the "era of great peace" is still an era of cannibalism, still a dark world of being oppressed, exploited, and enslaved. They never yearn for this kind of "peace" of "being a stable slave," but demand another kind of peace of "killing all injustices."
    Only peasant uprisings are the grand festivals of the working people in feudal society. The peasants "rose up" and broke free from the line of death. They used revolutionary violence to disrupt the dark feudal ruling order: "Servants sit in the hall," "masters kneel in the hall"; "no corvée, no grain"; corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry were killed and driven away; granaries were opened and grain was distributed, and contracts were burned and land was occupied. Please tell me, which "era of great peace" has given the peasants such a good time! In the long dark night of feudal society, only the torch of peasant uprisings illuminated the path of historical progress and was the true light in history.
    Comrade Wu Han said that the economy and culture of feudal society were developed in the "era of great peace," which is historical progress. In his view, it seems that only when class contradictions are eased, feudal rule is relatively stable, and the peasants "become stable slaves" can production develop and society progress. This view runs counter to Marxism.
    Marxism believes that in class society, it is precisely class struggle that has promoted the development of productive forces and social economy. Marx pointed out: "Up to now, productive forces have developed due to this law of class antagonism. If one insists that people can create higher-level products and engage in more complex production only because all the needs of all laborers have been met, it would be to disregard class antagonism and reverse the entire process of historical development."? The so-called "era of great peace" should not be inevitably linked to the development of the social economy. For example, the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the two Song Dynasties, and the late Ming Dynasty were all periods of significant development in China's feudal economy, but they were not so-called "eras of great peace." Even the development of the social economy that appeared in the "era of great peace" is ultimately the result of the peasants' class struggle and production struggle, and should not be written in the credit book of emperors, generals, and ministers.
    As the superstructure, culture is also developed in class struggle. There are two kinds of culture in feudal society: the decadent feudal culture and the excellent people's culture. The excellent people's culture is the "democratic essence" in China's cultural heritage. From the history of cultural development in feudal society, it often appears in periods of sharp and complex social contradictions and class struggles. The culture that appears in the relatively stable period of feudal rule is often the decadent feudal culture.
    It should be pointed out that while affirming the economic and cultural development of feudal society, we must never forget that the economic and cultural development is achieved through the cruel exploitation of peasants, and those who benefit from it are not the peasant class but the landlord class. "Every progress in production is also a step back in the living conditions of the oppressed class, that is, the majority."? Closely following the development of the feudal economy is the continuous bankruptcy and exile of peasants. It is not difficult to understand why the intensification of class contradictions follows the "prosperity" of the feudal dynasty.
    Another "argument" of Comrade Wu Han and others is that the "good deeds" done by the "good emperors" and "good officials," and the policies of "light taxes," "rest with the people," and "encouraging farming," although starting from the long-term interests of the ruling class, still bring some current benefits to the working people. Isn't there a consistency between the long-term interests of the ruling class and the current interests of the working people? Comrade Wu Han also used this "theory" of consistency of interests in his "self-criticism" to counterattack the comrades who criticized him. Therefore, we must take a good look at what this "theory" is.
    According to the viewpoint of materialist dialectics, there is a unity between the two opposing classes in class society. In feudal society, this unity is manifested in the fact that the landlord class is in the position of ruling and exploiting, while the peasant class is in the position of being ruled and exploited. Without the ruled and exploited, there would be no rulers and exploiters; without the oppression and enslavement of the rulers and exploiters, the peasants would not be in the position of being oppressed and exploited. It is precisely this unity of ruling and being ruled, exploiting and being exploited, that makes it impossible for there to be any consistency of interests between the peasant class and the landlord class. Engels pointed out that in class society, "what is good for some must be bad for others."? Since the policies implemented by the rulers are all aimed at consolidating their exploitation and rule, they will eventually bring disaster to the ruled class, and can never bring any benefits.
    How should we view the policies of "light taxes," "rest with the people," and "encouraging farming" implemented by the ruling class?
    Marx and Engels said: "In order to be able to oppress a certain class, it is necessary to ensure that this class has at least the conditions to maintain its slave-like existence."? In order to continuously extract blood and sweat from the peasants to satisfy their ever-expanding greed, the landlord class has to maintain the conditions for simple reproduction of feudal society and the conditions for the reproduction of labor. When these conditions cannot be maintained, such as after a major war, or when encountering major natural disasters, or due to the cruel exploitation of the landlord class, causing a large loss and death of labor, and a crisis appears in social production, the feudal rulers often implement policies such as "light taxes," "rest with the people," and "encouraging farming." These policies are a kind of class policy of the landlord class, so that the peasants can obtain the conditions for simple reproduction and the conditions for their own survival, "completely to make the peasants exploited by the landlords, 'guaranteeing' that the landlords have manpower, and never to truly guarantee the lives of the peasants themselves."? What "benefits" are there for the peasants? In fact, these policies are still policies that directly support the landlord economy, and are policies to adjust the internal relations of the landlord class and strengthen the class foundation of feudal rule. Xun Yue once pointed out that Emperor Wen of Han's "efforts to eliminate taxes" were "just enough to enrich the strong." Kangxi also had to admit that "repeatedly issuing decrees to reduce taxes, poor people without land, may not all enjoy the benefits."?
    When the peasants rise up to resist and feudal rule is crumbling, the landlord class and the feudal state sometimes throw out a little "small favor" and implement some so-called "benevolent governance." However, as Lenin said, this is "a measure to oppose the revolutionary class but also somewhat improve the situation of this class and thereby prevent the collapse of the ruling class."? This kind of "benevolent governance" is just poison coated with sugar, and only by not being deceived by this kind of "benevolent governance" and using their own struggle can the peasants take back their lost interests from the landlord class. What attitude should our historians take towards this so-called "benevolent governance"? How can they eulogize it and say that it is "making the peasants happy and the landlords also happy," "easing class contradictions," and promoting the development of "good things"? There is no doubt that Marxists should expose its deception, expose its harm to the revolutionary struggle at that time, and help today's people learn lessons from history in order to improve their ability to recognize the deceptive methods of all reactionary ruling forces in the world.
    Comrade Wu Han repeatedly promoted the consistency of the "long-term interests" of the landlord class and the "current interests" of the peasant class. According to this absurd logic, wouldn't the more consolidated the feudal rule, the more current interests the peasants would obtain? Wouldn't the more the peasants' anti-feudal struggle developed, the more the peasants would lose their current interests? Isn't the peasant uprising opposing not the landlord class, but the peasants' own current interests? According to Comrade Wu Han's statement, the exploited and oppressed peasants should not rise up to engage in revolution, as long as they wait for "good emperors" and "good officials" to come out to do "good things," they will live a "good life," and history will naturally progress. This kind of argument "actually uses the bourgeois theory of 'common' 'social' progress to replace the socialist theory that class struggle is the only real driving force of history."?
    Comrade Wu Han and others always like to say that "good emperors" are better than "bad emperors," and "clean officials" are better than "corrupt officials." This metaphysical view of good and bad, as Lenin pointed out, is "the strategy of vulgar bourgeois progressives: to support 'better things' anytime and anywhere; to choose between the reactionaries and the extreme right-wing forces opposing this reactionary."?
    Comrade Wu Han's enthusiasm for publicizing the "era of great peace," beautifying the feudal state and feudal emperors, advocating the theory of class reconciliation of "two combining into one," and advocating the idea of obedient people is precisely the inevitable reflection of his bourgeois reactionary political view and historical view.
      The "era of great peace" is a traditional concept that feudal historians have long carefully concocted, and now some people have brushed a layer of "theoretical" paint on it with the so-called "consistency of interests." This issue is an important part of the struggle between the two historical views in the current historical circles. Revolutionary historical workers must thoroughly break this traditional concept in order to complete the task of reversing the reversed history again.

          III. Exposing the Mist of "Historicism"
    What kind of viewpoint and method should be used to study history is a major issue in the historical revolution.
    We believe that only under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and using the class viewpoint and class analysis method, can we scientifically study history and complete the task of historical revolution.
    Comrade Wu Han and others opposed rewriting history according to the viewpoint and method of historical materialism, and the main weapon they brought out was "historicism." On the issue of peasant wars, the issue of evaluating historical figures, the issue of inheriting cultural and moral heritage, and the issue of historical scientific methodology, all kinds of anti-Marxist viewpoints were disseminated under the banner of "historicism." "Historicism" was all the rage.
    They attacked the Marxist class viewpoint as "the theory of solely focusing on class origin," as "one-sided," "mechanical," and "narrow," as "the root of non-historicism," and advocated using "historicism" to "supplement" the class viewpoint. Comrade Jian Bozan said: "In addition to the class viewpoint, there must also be historicism," "If there is only the class viewpoint and historicism is forgotten, it is easy to deny everything one-sidedly."? Comrade Wu Han said: "The sense of propriety is historicism."? What is their "sense of propriety"? According to him, it means that it is not necessary or appropriate to do a Marxist analysis of the historical figures of the exploiting class, "as long as there is contribution, there is something new," "it should be affirmed without the slightest hesitation."?, for those "outstanding," "wise," and "remarkable" emperors in feudal society, "it should be affirmed, praised, and eulogized."? In a word, only their "merits" are allowed to be eulogized, and their reactionary essence of the exploiting class is not allowed to be criticized, otherwise, it is "demanding too much from the predecessors." As for the peasant uprisings in history, they only "played the role of negative teachers," and writing about their failures is "without educational significance." They can only be criticized, not eulogized, otherwise, it is "modernizing the ancients," it is "non-historicism."?
    Where is there any scientific sense of propriety in such "historicism"? It is clearly the most lacking in sense of propriety, clearly anti-Marxist stuff, but they want to create a mist, using so-called "development view," "dialectics," "seeking truth from facts," "science," and so on, claiming to be "Marxist historicism," showing off and confusing people.
    Marxist classics occasionally used the term "historicism." For example, Marx and Engels used "non-historicism," Lenin spoke of "material historicism," and Comrade Mao Zedong mentioned "Marxist historicist." However, Marxists never talked about "historicism" without leaving class and class struggle. When Lenin replied to the attacks of the Russian "legal Marxist" Struve on Marxism, he pointed out that only "material historicism" can understand the temporality of capitalism and see the class struggle in it.? Marxist historicism is historical materialism.
    In Western bourgeois historiography, the so-called "historicism" has been popular since the 19th century. In modern bourgeois scholars, "historicism" is becoming more and more of a fashionable "theory," mainly used to oppose the Marxist theory of class struggle. Modern revisionists cater to the anti-Marxist trend of thought of the bourgeoisie, and vigorously tout the so-called "historicism," using it to oppose the so-called "dogmatism," which is to oppose Marxism-Leninism.
    Whether or not to admit that the class viewpoint is the basic method of studying social history is the fundamental dividing line between Marxist historicism and bourgeois historicism. Comrade Wu Han and others' "historicism" is precisely to castrate and oppose the theory of class struggle. Therefore, this is not Marxist historicism, but bourgeois "historicism."
    Although Comrade Wu Han and others' "historicism" have different origins, they are consistent in opposing Marxism and restoring the old historiography. This can be seen most clearly from Comrade Wu Han's repeatedly publicized "theory from historical facts" and the so-called "standards of the time and place."
    The so-called "standards of the time and place" is Comrade Wu Han's use of bourgeois "objectivism" to oppose the Marxist method of class analysis. Lenin said: "No living person can fail to stand on the side of this or that class."? The ancients commented on their predecessors with their own class standards. So do the people of today evaluate the ancients. What kind of class standard is the so-called "standards of the time and place," after all? Is it the standard of the peasants, or the standard of the landlords? There is no such thing as a general "standards of the time and place." The "standards of the time and place" itself is a class standard, that is, the standard of the bourgeoisie. Whether it is Comrade Wu Han's "On Wu Zetian" or "On Hai Rui," he did not and could not implement his so-called "standards of the time and place," but imposed the "ideology of today's" bourgeoisie on the ancients. He is just using Wu Zetian and Hai Rui as "puppets," and putting "his own 'thoughts and feelings' into their heads."? "Standards of the time and place" is actually not a new invention. As early as forty years ago, Liang Qichao imported this "theory" from the West, saying that "the historical traces, must be combined with the two concepts of 'at that time' and 'this place' before there can be an evaluation."? This "at that time" and "this place" standard only talks about the causal relationship between individual things, and denies the objective law of class struggle.
    The revolutionary historical workers put forward the slogan of "using theory to lead history" to highlight the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to historical research, to correctly handle the relationship between theory and historical materials in research work, and to oppose the bourgeois historical view of "historical materials are history" and "research for the sake of research." This slogan aroused strong opposition from some people, who deliberately distorted it as "using theory to replace history." Comrade Jian Bozan openly declared: "This statement should be abolished."? Comrade Wu Han put forward the slogan of "theory from history," saying that "as long as the real historical facts are clearly presented, the viewpoint will naturally come out."? It seems that historical research does not need any theoretical guidance. This is really a fairy tale-like myth! There has not yet been a historian in the world without his own point of view. Any historian is engaged in historical research under the guidance of a certain world view and theory. The question is what kind of viewpoint and theory to use as guidance. Isn't Comrade Wu Han going to "present" historical materials? Why "present" this kind of historical material, not "present" that kind of historical material; "present" it in this way, and not "present" it in that way, isn't there a certain viewpoint as guidance here? Comrade Wu Han's "theory from history" is a historical theory, but it is not historical materialism, but the theory of historical idealism.
    Originally, the sentence "theory from history" can be interpreted in a Marxist way. Marxism believes that correct historical theory comes from objective historical reality and current social practice, and in turn promotes current practice. Through the continuous and repeated process from matter to spirit, and from spirit to matter, historical theory is also continuously developed. Comrade Wu Han's "theory from history" is completely a bourgeois viewpoint. His "history" is not the objective historical reality, but the things recorded by feudal historians; his so-called "theory" is by no means a Marxist theory, but the "theory" of bourgeois pseudo-science. His method of "presenting" historical materials is Hu Shi's anti-scientific method of "boldly hypothesizing, carefully verifying." However, he used the so-called "daring to think and dare to say" to replace "boldly hypothesizing," and used the so-called "investigation and research" to replace "carefully verifying." If I hypothesize that Hai Rui is the "savior" of the people, I will "present" the lengthy records of feudal writers, translate classical Chinese into vernacular, and add some explanations, and Hai Rui will be "verified" as a "hero" who "pleads for the people." If I want to say that emperors, generals, and ministers are the "masters" of history, I will "present" a twenty-four history, explaining that there are many things recorded about them in historical books, and many people praise them, while the peasants and their revolutionary leaders, "have no achievements in their entire lives," "there are few records of their deeds in history," so the conclusion that emperors, generals, and ministers are the "leading face" of history and "good ancestors" is "verified" again. History seems to have really become "a girl who can be dressed up at will"! Hu Shi once boasted that "the scientific (note: should be read as pragmatism) method can actually make the old paper pile shine brightly."? Isn't Comrade Wu Han eulogizing emperors, generals, "clean officials," "good officials," and feudal morality "making the old paper pile shine brightly"! It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's so-called "theory from history" is nothing more than under the guidance of the pragmatic idealist viewpoint, from the "history" of feudal society, to the anti-Marxist "theory" of the bourgeoisie!
    Comrade Wu Han not only revived pragmatic historiography, but also repeated Hu Shi's argument of "researching more problems and talking less about -isms." In his article "Several Questions on the Study of History" written on the "May Fourth" Youth Day in 1962, he falsely claimed that Hu Shi advocated talking less about -isms and more about problems, "this view is rare today," and then asked: "But how to guide the study and learning of history with theory? This is worth studying."? What is the result of Comrade Wu Han's "research"? If we compare Comrade Wu Han's attacks on Marxism with Hu Shi's attacks, the problem will be very clear. Hu Shi once cursed that "empty talk about pleasant 'isms' is extremely easy, it is something that cats and dogs can do," and not researching problems is "due to a lazy word." Comrade Wu Han also said that learning Marxism is "empty talk to empty talk," "firing blanks," "from theory to theory," and so on. He attacked those who believe that "history should be written according to the method of Marxism-Leninism" as "writing history according to their own imagination, creating history," as "historical creators."? He warned people to read more, copy more, write more outlines, and make more cards, "never be lazy"! Hu Shi attacked "empty talk about foreign imported 'isms' is useless." Comrade Wu Han said, "Pay attention to the particularity of (Marxist) theory"! Hu Shi openly denied the absoluteness of truth, and advocated that no "ism" should be "regarded as the golden rule." Comrade Wu Han openly opposed the universality of truth, and repeatedly emphasized that "the views of Marx,

    坚持历史科学的革命方向
    ——评吴晗等同志的资产阶级史学路线
    史绍宾
    提要　以吴晗同志为代表的一股反动史学思潮，拼命抵制历史科学的革命，在一系列根本问题上，提出了一条反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的史学路线。
    吴晗同志所谓代表“历史上的光明面”的“太平盛世”，不过是地主阶级的“太平”、“盛世”和“光明”。农民阶级和地主阶级之间，根本没有什么利益的一致。吴晗同志等反对马克思主义理论的主要法宝是资产阶级的“历史主义”。
    吴晗同志反对历史研究遵循党的政策的指引，反对史学为无产阶级政治服务，是要为资产阶级复辟效劳。他要史学工作者走的，是脱离实际、脱离政治、钻古书堆、追求个人名利的资产阶级道路。一切有志气的史学工作者，应该到工农兵群众中去，滚他一身泥巴。
    一九五八年以来，随着社会主义革命的不断深入和社会主义建设的日益发展，我国历史学界掀起了一场深刻的革命。当前的大好形势，迫切地要求史学工作者高举马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的批判旗帜，清除一切封建的、资产阶级的史学思想，与旧史学传统彻底决裂，发展马克思主义的历史科学。
    史学领域这一伟大革命，遭到了那些坚持资产阶级史学方向的人的拚命抵制。因为这一革命将打破他们对史学的垄断，摧毁他们安身立命的基础，所以他们惶惶不安，百般诅咒，“骨鲠在喉”，不吐不快。以吴晗同志为代表的一股反动史学思潮出现了。他们在写什么样的历史，以什么观点、方法来指导写历史，为谁写历史，由什么样的人来写历史这样一系列根本性问题上，提出了一条反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的史学路线。于是，史学领域的两种历史观、两种方法、两条道路的斗争更加激烈和尖锐起来。
          一、当前两种历史观斗争的焦点
    一部二十四史，充满了剥削阶级的谎言。几千年来阶级社会的历史，被写成帝王将相的家谱。剥削阶级大大小小的头子、双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，都被描绘成创造历史的“英雄”。而人民群众则被诬蔑为“盗贼”、“匪寇”和“叛逆”。历史完全被颠倒了。史学被剥削阶级把持着，成了他们压迫和欺骗劳动人民的政治工具。
    马克思主义揭破了这种历史的欺骗，庄严地指出：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”①。恩格斯要求无产阶级以唯物史观为指南，重新研究全部历史②。毛泽东同志在二十多年前也给我国革命的文艺工作者和史学工作者提出了“把这种历史的颠倒”“再颠倒过来”的政治任务③。
    解放以来，我国无产阶级和广大劳动人民做了国家的主人，在党的领导下开展着改造旧世界、建设新世界的历史活动。当前人民群众的革命创造活动，更深刻地体现了劳动人民是历史主人这一伟大真理。同时，我们无产阶级专政的国家，又给重新改写历史提供了充分的客观条件。这种形势促使革命的史学工作者进一步探讨和阐发历史上劳动人民的创造活动，鼓舞广大人民的革命斗志，实现革命导师提出的改写全部历史的革命任务。
    但是以吴晗同志为代表的一部分人，却反对史学工作者去完成这一革命任务。他们写文章、作报告，极力讴歌“圣君贤相”，吹捧“清官”“好官”，大声疾呼：保卫帝王将相，保卫王朝体系。吴晗同志谈到帝王将相在历史上的作用时，说：“这要从两方面来看。一方面，正如毛主席说的，人民大众是革命的动力，农民战争是社会发展的动力。可是就另一方面看，在过去的历史时代里，在某项政治措施、工程建设或大规模的战争里，起主导作用的是谁？是历史上的帝王将相领导、指挥了这些工作。”④在这里，他玩弄折衷主义的手法，狂妄地宣称毛泽东同志关于历史唯物主义的基本观点只是“一方面”，实际上是拿自己的“另一方面”来否定毛泽东同志这个基本观点。他还指责革命的史学工作者“极力想避免对帝王将相的歌颂，以免丧失立场，结果除秦始皇而外，对象汉武、唐宗、康熙、乾隆等这样比较全盛的时代的领导人物不写或很少描写，于是，历史上的光明面丧失了，写在书上的尽是这个皇朝如何坏，农民起义推翻了它，另一皇朝起来了，又如何坏，农民起义又推翻了它，一片打倒声，历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”⑤。在他看来，根本不应该写人民群众的历史，贫雇农“一辈子没有什么成就”，把他们写在历史上，“历史就太多了，读不胜读了，也就取消了历史了”⑥。
    吴晗同志的这种恶意攻击，正好充分暴露了他为剥削阶级辩护的唯心史观。革命的史学工作者根本不是什么“极力想避免对帝王将相的歌颂”，而是要彻底扫荡封建统治阶级和资产阶级对于帝王将相的歌颂。我们要歌颂的是人民群众。马克思主义从来都承认杰出人物的历史作用。但是，吴晗同志所说的杰出人物，无非是帝王将相，文人学士。对这些人，吴晗同志满怀深情，颂扬备至；马克思主义者则坚定地站在无产阶级的立场，从人民的根本利益出发，进行科学的分析和评价，对于其中确实对历史发展作出贡献的杰出人物，也给以应有的历史地位。但是，革命史学工作者要大书特书、热情歌颂的杰出人物，应当是那些长期为剥削阶级史家所诬蔑、歪曲、抹煞的人民英雄，如陈胜、吴广、黄巢、李自成、洪秀全等等。对这些人，吴晗同志却抱着传统的史学偏见，充满厌恶之情，加以口诛笔伐。显然，革命史学工作者同吴晗同志的分歧，决不止是如何评价杰出人物，而是：究竟谁是历史的主人，什么是历史的动力的根本问题。
    这样，颠倒了的历史要不要再颠倒的问题，就成了当前两种历史观斗争的焦点。
      二、驳帝王将相保卫者的两个“论据”
    吴晗等同志反对把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来，说来说去，理由不外是帝王将相在历史上是“起作用的”，农民是“不起作用的”。帝王将相的历史作用表现在哪里呢？据说：（一）他们
  “养”出的“太平盛世”，是“历史上的光明面”；（二）他们“有意识地”办了一些“和封建统治阶级的长远利益一致的，也是和被压迫被剥削的广大人民当前利益一致的”所谓“好事”。这两个“论据”颇为迷惑了一些人，有必要剖析一下。
    所谓“太平盛世”，是历代封建史学家按照儒家思想精心塑造的封建统治的政治标本。他们把它粉饰为“君子咸乐其生，小人各安其业，强无凌弱，众不暴寡”；“囹圄常空”；“海内升平，路不拾遗，外户不闭，商旅野宿”⑦。在他们的笔下，压迫者和被压迫者，剥削者和被剥削者的矛盾和斗争没有了，完全是一派“上下晏安”、共享太平的美妙景象！吴晗同志用资产阶级的观点重新对这种封建的政治标本加工炮制，把它大大吹胀起来。封建史学家所说的“太平盛世”，不过是“文景之治”、“贞观之治”等，吴晗同志则认为凡是有他的“好皇帝”如曹操、武则天、朱元璋、康熙等统治的时期，都是“天下太平”。即使没有“好皇帝”，那里有个什么“清官”、“好官”，那里的“天”也就“青”了。不仅如此，他还进一步编造出“太平盛世”代表所谓“历史上的光明面”的荒唐理论。
    马克思主义的阶级观点告诉我们：在阶级社会里，根本没有全民的“太平”、全民的“盛世”和全民的“光明”。吴晗同志所讴歌和粉饰的“太平盛世”，究竟是哪个阶级的“太平”，哪个阶级的“盛世”，又是哪个阶级的“光明”呢？
    从阶级斗争的观点看来，所谓“太平盛世”，不过是地主阶级的“太平”、地主阶级的“盛世”和地主阶级的“光明”罢了。
    地主阶级和农民阶级的矛盾和对立是中国封建社会贯串始终的基本矛盾。考察封建社会的一切历史现象和历史事件，只能从这一基本矛盾的运动、发展和变化来进行具体分析。在几千年的封建社会中，阶级斗争的发展是波浪式的，有高潮，有低潮，呈现出阶段性。当着地主阶级的残酷统治和剥削迫使农民揭竿而起的时候，矛盾便采取外部对抗的形式，阶级斗争达到高潮；当着农民起义陷于失败，被地主阶级利用了去作为改朝换代的工具的时候，农民的阶级斗争便进入低潮时期，封建统治出现了一个暂时的相对稳定的局面。这时，阶级矛盾和阶级斗争并没有消失，只不过是采取了另一种形式而已。随着统治阶级对劳动人民的剥削和压迫日益加重，阶级矛盾又趋尖锐，封建统治从相对稳定局面逐步陷入危机，走向矛盾的总爆发，引起又一次农民大起义，阶级斗争又进入高潮时期。所谓“太平盛世”，往往出现在这种相对稳定时期。
    对地主阶级来说，“太平盛世”就是封建统治的重整和强化。对农民阶级来说，那就是革命斗争果实不断被剥夺，封建枷锁重新加在身上并逐步加紧的过程。在大规模农民起义和农民战争之后，在农民血泊中建立起来的封建王朝，首先巩固和加强对农民的专政，实行各种欺骗性的政策和强制措施来搜刮劳动人民，把挣脱或部分挣脱封建束缚的农民重新强制固着在土地上，置于封建统治阶级及封建王朝的完全控制之下，以保证徭役赋税兵力的来源及一切剥削条件。西汉初的“复故爵田宅”，唐初的“均田”，以及历代王朝的“招抚流亡”的政策，尽管它们的具体方法有所不同，其实质和真正的目的无不在此。
    与此同时，封建王朝通过“赏赐”和特权的授予，积极扶植新旧地主，培植自己的统治基础。地主阶级的政治、经济力量便重新恢复、发展和加强起来。我们从汉唐明清的所谓“盛世”，都可以看到这种现象：地主阶级利用这个相对稳定的时机，大量兼并掠夺农民的土地，加重剥削，拚命压榨农民的膏血。对于这一点，连封建的史学家也无法完全加以掩饰。杜佑就曾指出，“开元之季、天宝以来”，“兼并之弊，有逾于汉成哀之间”⑧。因此，所谓“太平盛世”的发展过程，正是新旧官僚、地主、贵族联合起来向农民进攻，不断加重对农民剥削、压迫和掠夺的过程。
      “盛世”之下，一方面是封建国家富足了，地主阶级富足了。经过汉初七十年的休养生息，出现的所谓“京师之钱累百巨万”，“太仓之粟陈陈相因”；杜甫所说的“忆昔开元全盛日，……公私仓廪俱丰实”，正是这种情景的写照。地主阶级通过压迫和剥削，积累起大量财富，供其荒淫侈乐、穷兵黩武，造成他们的“文治武功”、“繁荣昌盛”。另一方面，则是农民重新陷入封建统治的黑暗牢狱。请看，众口交道的“文景之治”是：“失时不雨，民且狼顾”，“富人不贷，贫民且饥”；武帝“盛世”则是：“富者田连阡陌，贫者亡立锥之地”，“贫民常衣牛马之衣，而食犬彘之食”；贞观时，农民“给役者兄去弟还，道路相继”，为了避役，他们“往往自折支体，谓之‘福手’‘福足’”；康熙时
  “穷民无所为赖，妻去其夫，子离其父，常叹其生之不犬马若也”，“四海之内，日益困穷，……吴中之民，多鬻男女于远方”⑨。
      “盛世”并没有改变广大农民奴隶式的悲惨生活状况。因此，农民反抗地主阶级的各种斗争并没有停止，只不过是矛盾还没有全面激化而已。如贞观时，“剑外骚然”。被吴晗同志誉之为“治于下”的“古代最伟大的妇女”武则天时期，“天下户口逃亡过半”，而且“山东群盗，缘兹聚结”⑩。农民用自己的行动，揭穿了“太平盛世”的神话。
    封建史学家所以要讴歌和粉饰“太平盛世”，是把它作为封建的政治理想，告诫统治者如何才能“长治久安”；同时企图以此“安抚”农民，麻痹农民的阶级意识和革命斗志，诱使他们向往这种“太平盛世”，向往“清官”、“好皇帝”。但是对于广大贫苦农民来说，“太平盛世”仍然是人吃人的时代，仍然是被压迫、被剥削、被奴役的黑暗世界，他们绝不向往这种“做稳奴隶”的“太平”，而是要求“杀尽不平”的另一种太平。
    只有农民起义，才是封建社会劳动人民的盛大节日。农民
  “揭竿而起”，从死亡线上挣脱出来。他们用革命暴力，打乱了黑暗的封建统治秩序：“仆坐堂上”、“主跪堂下”；“不当差，不纳粮”；贪官污吏，土豪劣绅，杀的杀，赶的赶；开仓分粮，焚契占田。请问，哪一个“太平盛世”给过农民这样的好光景！在封建社会漫长的黑夜里，只有农民起义的火炬，才照亮了历史前进的道路，才是历史上真正的光明。
    吴晗同志说，封建社会的经济文化正是在“太平盛世”发展起来的，这是历史的进步。在他看来，似乎只有阶级矛盾缓和了，封建统治相对稳定了，农民“做稳奴隶”了，生产才能发展，社会才能进步。这种观点是和马克思主义背道而驰的。
    马克思主义认为：在阶级社会中，正是阶级斗争推动了生产力的发展和社会经济的发展。马克思指出：“到目前为止，生产力就是由于这种阶级对抗的规律而发展起来的。如果硬说由于所有劳动者的一切需要都已满足，所以人们才能创造更高级的产品和从事更复杂的生产，那就是撇开阶级对抗，颠倒整个历史的发展过程。”?不能把所谓“太平盛世”和社会经济的发展必然地扯在一起。比如春秋战国时期，两宋时期，明代后期，都是我国封建经济有显著发展的时期，但是它们都不是所谓“太平盛世”。即使在“太平盛世”出现的社会经济的发展，归根到底也是农民的阶级斗争和生产斗争的结果，而不应该把它写在帝王将相的功劳簿上。
    作为上层建筑的文化，也是在阶级斗争中发展起来的。封建社会有两种文化：腐朽的封建文化和优秀的人民文化。优秀的人民文化是我国文化遗产中的“民主性的精华”。从封建社会文化发展的历史来看，它往往出现在社会矛盾、阶级斗争尖锐复杂的时期。而出现于封建统治相对稳定时期的文化，则往往是那些腐朽的封建文化。
    应该指出，在肯定封建社会经济、文化发展的同时，我们一刻也不能忘记，经济、文化的发展是通过对农民的残酷剥削来实现的，从中获得好处的不是农民阶级而是地主阶级。“生产的每一进步，同时也就是被压迫阶级即大多数人的生活状况的一个退步”?。紧紧伴随着封建经济的发展的是农民的不断破产和流亡。这就不难理解，为什么在封建王朝“繁荣昌盛”之后，接着而来的便是阶级矛盾的激化。
    吴晗等同志的另一个“论据”是：“好皇帝”、“好官”所办的“好事”，实行的“轻徭薄赋”、“与民休息”、“劝导农桑”等政策，尽管是从统治阶级的长远利益出发，可是毕竟给劳动人民也带来了一些当前的利益。统治阶级的长远利益和劳动人民的当前利益不是存在一致性吗？吴晗同志在他的“自我批评”中还用这个利益一致性的“理论”反击批评他的同志们。因此，我们要好好看看这个“理论”是什么货色。
    按照唯物辩证法的观点，阶级社会中两个对立的阶级之间是存在统一性的。在封建社会，这种统一性表现在，地主阶级处于统治、剥削的地位，而农民阶级处于被统治、被剥削的地位。没有被统治者、被剥削者，就没有统治者、剥削者；没有统治者、剥削者的压迫和奴役，农民就不会处于受压迫、受剥削的地位。正是这种统治与被统治、剥削与被剥削的统一性，使得农民阶级和地主阶级之间不可能有任何利益上的一致。恩格斯指出，在阶级社会中，“对一些人是好事的，对另一些人必然是坏事”?。既然统治者所实行的政策无不是为了巩固他们的剥削和统治，那么，对于被统治阶级来说，迟早总会带来灾难，而绝不能带来什么利益。
    到底应该怎么看待统治阶级所实行的“轻徭薄赋”、“与民休息”和“劝导农桑”等政策呢？
    马克思和恩格斯说：“为了有可能压迫某一个阶级，就必须保证这个阶级至少有能够维持它那奴隶般生存的条件。”?地主阶级为了不断地从农民身上榨取血汗，来满足他们不断扩大的贪欲，不能不维持封建社会简单再生产的条件和劳动力再生产的条件。当这种条件不能维持的时候，例如在大的战争之后，或者遇到大的自然灾害，或者由于地主阶级的残酷剥削，引起劳动力大量散失和死亡，社会生产出现危机的时候，封建统治者往往要实行“轻徭薄赋”、“与民休息”、“劝导农桑”种种政策。这些政策是地主阶级的一种阶级政策，使农民获得简单再生产的条件，获得自身生存的条件，“完全是用来使农民受地主剥削，‘保证’地主有人手，从来不是用来真正保证农民本人的生活”?。这对农民有什么“利益”可言呢？实际上，这些政策还是直接扶植地主经济的政策，是调整地主阶级内部关系，加强封建统治的阶级基础的政策。荀悦即曾指出：汉文帝“务除租税”是“适足以资富强”。康熙也不得不承认：“屡颁蠲诏，无田穷民，未必均沾惠泽”?。
    当着农民起来反抗，封建统治摇摇欲坠的时候，地主阶级和封建国家为了削弱和瓦解农民革命，有时也会抛出一点“小恩小惠”，实行一些所谓“仁政”。但是，这正如列宁所说的，是“一种反对革命阶级但也多少改善这个阶级处境并以此防止统治阶级垮台的措施”?。这种“仁政”不过是糖衣裹着的毒药，农民只有不受这种“仁政”的欺骗，用自己的斗争，才能从地主阶级手里夺回自己失去的利益。我们的史学家对待这种所谓“仁政”应当采取什么态度，怎么能够歌颂它，把它说成是“使农民高兴，地主也高兴”，“缓和阶级矛盾”，推动社会发展的“好事”呢？毫无疑问，马克思主义者是应当揭露它的欺骗性，揭露它对当时革命斗争的危害，帮助今天的人民群众从历史中吸取教训，以提高对于世界上一切反动统治势力的欺骗手段的认识能力。
    吴晗同志反复宣传地主阶级的“长远利益”与农民阶级的“当前利益”的一致性。按照这种荒唐逻辑，岂不是封建统治越巩固，农民获得的当前利益就越多吗？岂不是农民反封建的斗争越发展，农民就越加丧失自己的当前利益吗？岂不是农民起义反对的不是地主阶级，反而是农民自己的当前利益吗？按照吴晗同志的说法，被剥削被压迫的农民不应当起来搞革命，只要等待“好皇帝”、“好官”出来办“好事”，就会过“好日子”了，历史也就自然进步了。这种论调，“实际上是用资产阶级的‘共同的’‘社会’进步的理论来代替阶级斗争是历史唯一的实际动力这个社会主义的理论”?。
    吴晗等同志总是喜欢说“好皇帝”比“坏皇帝”好，“清官”比“贪官”好。这种形而上学的好坏观，正如列宁指出的，是
  “资产阶级庸俗的进步派的策略：随时随地支持‘比较好的东西’；在反动派和同这种反动派对立的势力中的极右派之间进行选择”?。
    吴晗同志热中宣扬“太平盛世”，为封建国家和封建帝王涂脂抹粉，鼓吹“合二而一”的阶级调和论，鼓吹顺民思想，正是他的资产阶级反动政治观和历史观的必然反映。
      “太平盛世”是封建史学家长期精心炮制的一种传统观念，而现在有些人又用所谓“利益一致性”给它刷上一层“理论”油漆。这个问题是当前史学界两种历史观斗争中的一个重要内容。革命的史学工作者要完成把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来的任务，必须彻底破除这种传统观念。
          三、揭穿“历史主义”的迷雾
    究竟用什么样的观点和方法研究历史，这是史学革命的重大课题。
    我们认为，只有在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下，运用阶级观点和阶级分析方法，才能科学地研究历史，完成史学革命的任务。
    吴晗等同志反对按照历史唯物主义的观点和方法重新改写历史，他们搬出来的主要法宝是“历史主义”。在农民战争问题上，历史人物评价问题上，文化道德遗产继承问题上，以及历史科学方法论问题上，各色各样的反马克思主义观点都在“历史主义”的招牌下散播出来。“历史主义”风靡一时。
    他们攻击马克思主义的阶级观点是“唯成分论”，是“片面”的、“机械”的、“狭隘”的，是“非历史主义的根源”，鼓吹用“历史主义”来“补充”阶级观点。翦伯赞同志说：“除了阶级观点以外，还要有历史主义”，“如果只有阶级观点而忘记了历史主义，就容易片面地否定一切”?。吴晗同志说：“分寸就是历史主义”?。什么是他们的“分寸”？按照他的说法，就是对剥削阶级的历史人物不必要也不应当去做马克思主义的分析，“只要有贡献，有新东西”，“就应该肯定，丝毫也不必迟疑”?，对于封建社会那些“杰出的”、“英明的”、“了不起的”帝王，“应该肯定、表扬、歌颂”?。一句话，只许歌颂他们的“功德”，不许批判他们的剥削阶级的反动本质，否则，就是“苛求前人”。至于历史上的农民起义，只是“起了反面教员的作用”，不写他们的失败，就“没有教育意义”。对他们只能批判，不许歌颂，否则，就是“把古人现代化了”，就是“非历史主义”?。
    这样的“历史主义”，哪里有一点科学的分寸呢？明明是最没有分寸，明明是反马克思主义的货色，可是他们却要制造迷雾，以所谓“发展观”、“辩证法”、“实事求是”、“科学”等等相标榜，自称是“马克思主义的历史主义”，招摇过市，混淆视听。
    马克思主义的经典作家间或也使用“历史主义”的术语。例如，马克思和恩格斯用过“非历史主义”，列宁讲过“唯物的历史主义”，毛泽东同志提过“马克思主义的历史主义者”。但是，马克思主义者从来都不离开阶级和阶级斗争去谈论“历史主义”。列宁在回答俄国“合法的马克思主义者”司徒卢威对马克思主义的攻击时指出，只有“唯物的历史主义”才能了解资本主义的暂时性，看到其中的阶级斗争?。马克思主义的历史主义，就是历史唯物主义。
    在西方资产阶级历史学中，所谓“历史主义”是从十九世纪以后流行起来的。在现代资产阶级学者那里，“历史主义”愈来愈成为一种时髦“理论”，主要用来反对马克思主义的阶级斗争学说。现代修正主义者迎合资产阶级的反马克思主义思潮，大肆吹捧所谓“历史主义”，用以反对所谓“教条主义”，也就是反对马克思列宁主义。
    是否承认阶级观点是研究社会历史的基本方法，是马克思主义的历史主义和资产阶级的历史主义的根本分界线。吴晗等同志的“历史主义”，恰好是阉割和反对阶级斗争学说的。因此，这不是马克思主义的历史主义，而是资产阶级的“历史主义”。
    吴晗等同志的“历史主义”虽然各有师承，但是反对马克思主义和复辟旧史学却是一致的。这从吴晗同志反复宣扬的“论从史出”以及所谓“当时当地标准”中看得最为清楚。
    所谓“当时当地标准”，是吴晗同志用资产阶级“客观主义”的手法，来反对马克思主义的阶级分析方法的。列宁说：“没有一个活着的人能够不站到这个或那个阶级方面来”?。古人评论前人有自己的阶级标准。今人评价古人也是如此。所谓“当时当地标准”，究竟是按照当时当地什么阶级的标准呢？是农民的标准，还是地主的标准？一种笼统的“当时当地标准”是没有的。“当时当地标准”本身就是一种阶级标准，即资产阶级的标准。吴晗同志无论是《谈武则天》也好，《论海瑞》也好，都没有而且也不可能贯彻他所谓的“当时当地标准”，却是以“今天”资产阶级的“意识形态强加于古人”。他不过是把武则天和海瑞当作“木偶”，而把“自己的‘思想和感情’装进它的头里”?。“当时当地标准”，其实也不是什么新发明。早在四十多年前，梁启超就从西方进口了这种“理论”，说什么“史迹之为物，必与‘当时’‘此地’之两观念相结合，然后有评价之可言”?。这种“当时”“此地”标准，只讲个别事物间因果联系，否认阶级斗争的客观规律。
    革命的史学工作者提出“以论带史”的口号，是要求突出马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想对历史研究的指导，在研究工作中正确处理理论与史料的关系，反对“史料即史学”、“为研究而研究”的资产阶级史学观点。这个口号引起了一些人的强烈反对，故意把它歪曲为“以论代史”。翦伯赞同志公开宣称：“这个提法应当废除。”?吴晗同志提出了“论从史出”的口号，说什么“只要把真正的史实摆清楚了，观点自然就出来了”?。好象历史研究不需要任何理论作指导。这真是一种天方夜谭式的神话！世界上至今还没有一个没有自己观点的历史家。任何历史家总是在一定的世界观、理论的指导下从事历史研究的。问题在于究竟用什么样的观点、理论作指导。吴晗同志不是要“摆”史料吗？为什么“摆”这样的史料，不“摆”那样的史料；这样
  “摆”，而不那样“摆”，这里难道没有一定的观点作指导吗？吴晗同志的“论从史出”正是一种史学理论，不过不是历史唯物主义，而是历史唯心主义的理论。
    本来，“论从史出”这句话，可以作出马克思主义的解释。马克思主义认为，正确的历史理论来源于客观历史实际和当前的社会实践，又反过来推动当前的实践。经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质的不断反复的过程，历史理论也得到不断的发展。吴晗同志的“论从史出”却完全是资产阶级的观点。他的“史”，并不是客观历史实际，而是封建史家记载的东西；他的所谓
  “论”，绝不是马克思主义的理论，而是资产阶级伪科学的“理论”。他的“摆”史料方法，就是胡适“大胆假设，小心求证”的反科学方法。不过，他用所谓“敢想敢说”代替了“大胆假设”，用所谓“调查研究”代替了“小心求证”。我假设海瑞是人民的“救星”，我就把封建文人连篇累牍的记载“摆”出来，文言译成白话，加上若干解释，海瑞就被当作一个“为民请命”的
  “英雄”而“求证”出来了。我要说帝王将相是历史的“主人”，我就把一部二十四史“摆”出来，说明史书上记载他们的事很多，称赞他们的人很多，而农民和他们的革命领袖呢，“一辈子没有什么成就”，“历史上记载他的事迹却很少”，于是，帝王将相作为历史的“主导面”，是“好祖宗”的结论又被“求证”出来了。历史似乎真的变成“一个可以任意装扮的女孩子”！胡适曾经吹嘘“科学（按：应读作实用主义）的方法居然能使故纸堆里大放光明”?。吴晗同志歌颂帝王将相、“清官”、“好官”、封建道德，岂不正是在“使故纸堆里大放光明”吗！可见吴晗同志的所谓“论从史出”，无非是在实用主义唯心论观点指导之下，从封建社会之“史”，出资产阶级反马克思主义之“论”！
    吴晗同志不但复活了实用主义的历史学，而且重复了胡适
  “多研究问题，少谈些主义”的论调。他在一九六二年“五四”青年节写的《关于研究历史的几个问题》一文中诡称，胡适主张少谈些主义，多谈些问题，“这种看法在今天是很少了”，接着反问：“但如何以理论指导研究和学习历史呢？这是值得研究的。”?吴晗同志“研究”的结果是什么呢？如果我们把吴晗同志对马克思主义的攻击，和胡适的攻击加以对照，问题便十分清楚了。胡适曾经咒骂“空谈好听的‘主义’，是极容易的事，是阿猫阿狗都能做的事”，不研究问题是“由于一个懒字”。吴晗同志也说学习马克思主义是“空谈对空谈”，“放空炮”，“从理论到理论”等等。他攻击那些认为“应该根据马克思列宁主义的方法”来写历史的人，是“根据自己的想象来写历史，来创造历史”，是“历史创造家”?。他告诫人们要多读书，多抄书，多写提纲，多做卡片，“千万不可以偷懒”！胡适攻击“空谈外来进口的
  ‘主义’是没有什么用处的”。吴晗同志说“要注意（马克思主义）理论的特殊性”！胡适公开否认真理的绝对性，宣传对任何
  “主义”都不可以“奉为金科玉律”。吴晗同志则公开反对真理的普遍性，一再强调不能“用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的观点来代替作者自己的看法”！这不是和胡适鼓吹的不要“让马克思和列宁牵着鼻子走”的反动论调太相似了吗？
            四、历史研究和现实斗争
    马克思主义的历史科学是无产阶级进行政治斗争的锐利武器。吴晗等同志坚持资产阶级的反动历史观，根本目的是反对史学为无产阶级政治服务，使它为资产阶级复辟效劳。
    用所谓“科学性”来攻击马克思列宁主义史学的党性原则，是反动的资产阶级“学者”惯用的伎俩。吴晗等同志不仅继承了这套衣钵，而且把这个问题提得更加尖锐，矛头直接指向党的方针政策，指向无产阶级现实的政治斗争。他们说，史学要为无产阶级政治服务，就是“为了当前斗争的暂时性的、策略性的需要，对历史上的事物作任意的解释和评价”。有人认为，史学工作者只能按历史上统治者的政策去讲历史，而不应当考虑党的政策，不应当考虑当前革命斗争的需要，否则就是“强迫封建皇帝执行共产党的政策，是用社会主义的政策改造阶级社会的历史”。吴晗同志直截了当地说：“从今天的某些政策、方针出发，强迫历史实际服从今天的实际，是非科学的，非历史主义的学风”。他不仅号召大家“坚决反对”这种“学风”，而且端出所谓“从历史实际出发”，即死啃史料，作为“大家应该共同努力的方向”?。他们公然把史学为无产阶级政治服务先歪曲为“强迫历史实际服从今天的实际”，然后把它作为不良学风和错误方向来“坚决反对”，这是对马克思主义历史科学的严重挑战！
    大家知道，历史学真正成为科学是在马克思主义出现以后的事情。毛泽东同志指出：“在很长的历史时期内，大家对于社会的历史只能限于片面的了解，这一方面是由于剥削阶级的偏见经常歪曲社会的历史，另方面，则由于生产规模的狭小，限制了人们的眼界。人们能够对于社会历史的发展作全面的历史的了解，把对于社会的认识变成了科学，这只是到了伴随巨大生产力——大工业而出现近代无产阶级的时候，这就是马克思主义的科学。”?社会历史发展的规律和一切腐朽的剥削阶级的阶级利益背道而驰，剥削阶级的党性和科学性水火不容。无产阶级的解放利益完全符合社会发展的规律，对这种规律揭示和阐释得愈加深刻和彻底，就愈符合无产阶级的利益。高度的革命性和严格的科学性的统一是马克思主义的固有特点。马克思主义史学从来不隐瞒自己的党性，公开宣布为无产阶级政治服务，为劳动人民的解放事业服务。
    在我国社会主义革命不断深入的今天，史学为无产阶级政治服务更有其特殊重大的意义。毛泽东同志说：“一定的文化
  （当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济；而经济是基础，政治则是经济的集中的表现。这是我们对于文化和政治、经济的关系及政治和经济的关系的基本观点。”?作为观念形态的史学必须从属于一定的经济基础、从属于一定阶级的政治。封建的史学从属于封建的经济基础和地主阶级的政治，资产阶级的史学从属于资本主义的经济基础和资产阶级的政治。超阶级、超政治的历史学从来不存在。现在，我们的国家是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，封建的经济基础消灭了，资本主义的经济基础也已基本消灭。皮之不存，毛将焉附，一切为封建主义和资本主义服务的史学已经成了无皮之毛，已经成为社会发展的阻力，历史宣布它们已经失去了存在的权利。历史科学为无产阶级政治服务乃是社会主义的经济基础所要求的，是社会主义发展的客观规律所要求的。史学能不能遵照这一规律前进，是关系到历史科学今后存亡绝续的问题。
    史学为无产阶级政治服务不能是抽象的，不能是一句空洞的口头禅。史学要为无产阶级政治服务，它就绝不能是私人科学，绝不能是某个人的名山事业，绝不能搞资产阶级“自由化”，而只能是无产阶级总的革命事业的一部分，必须服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务。而党的政策正是一定时期的革命任务的集中体现，是无产阶级政治的集中表现。党的政策不是割断历史，只顾眼前的“权宜之计”，而是马克思列宁主义和中国革命的具体实际（包括历史的实际）相结合的产物，是从无产阶级的当前利益和长远利益的统一出发的。党对各项工作的领导正是通过党的政策来实现的。党的政策是党的生命。革命的史学要为无产阶级政治服务，要执行兴无灭资的战斗任务，就必须遵循党的政策的指引。吴晗同志把这个方向歪曲为“强迫历史实际服从今天的实际”，不过是要革命的史学离开正确的轨道。
    在社会主义社会的整个历史时期，都存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。史学不为无产阶级政治服务，脱离党的领导，脱离党的政策，就必然成为资产阶级政治复辟的工具。这是社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的。吴晗同志的“研究”活动充分证明了这一点。
    正当一九六一年前后，一些被推翻了的封建势力，利用封建宗法，在那里续家谱的时候，吴晗同志出来要我们认帝王将相做“祖宗”，要我们做他们的“好子孙”。这不是在为地主阶级续大家谱？
    正当右倾机会主义分子向党大肆进攻的时候，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》，赞扬一种抽象的“骂皇帝”的胆量和勇气；当这种进攻被击退之后，吴晗同志又写了《海瑞罢官》，使海瑞登上舞台，颂扬海瑞罢了官也不丧气，失败了再干的精神。这难道是“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”？
    正当全国人民在党的领导下，在意识形态领域内展开兴无灭资斗争的时候，吴晗同志却大肆美化封建地主阶级的代表人物，美化封建王法和封建国家，叫嚷继承封建道德、资产阶级道德，宣扬“阶级调和论”。这不是和无产阶级思想唱对台戏？
    凡此种种，不都清楚表明，吴晗同志的历史“研究”是为哪个阶级服务的吗？
    吴晗等同志标榜所谓“从历史实际出发”的“科学态度”，其实，他们为资产阶级效劳就必然要歪曲历史实际。请看，把帝王将相捧为历史的主体，这不是对历史最大的歪曲和颠倒？用资产阶级观点把地主阶级的忠臣海瑞装扮成“为民请命”的“英雄”，这不是伪造历史的典型？吴晗等同志的所谓“科学”，原来不过是资产阶级的伪科学！
    在没落的、贵族老爷式的资产阶级“政治家”和“学者”那里，党性和科学性，政治和历史是根本矛盾的。要服从资产阶级的反动党性和反动政治，就不能不伪造科学、伪造历史。吴晗等同志正是用这种资产阶级的庸人眼光来看待无产阶级历史科学与现实斗争的关系。殊不知，当他们搬出“非科学”的帽子往无产阶级历史学头上扣的时候，正好暴露了自己伪科学的面目，暴露了“强迫历史实际服从今天的实际”的不是无产阶级，而是他们自己。
    毛泽东同志说过：“哲学的命运，要看哲学满足社会阶级的需要的程度如何而定。”?史学的命运也是如此。历史科学只有适应无产阶级政治的需要才能成为强大的物质力量，成为改造旧世界、建设新世界的锐利武器；史学本身也才能成为真正战斗的、生气勃勃的、革命的科学！
      五、钻古书堆，还是到工农兵群众中去？
    彻底实现史学革命，必须建立一支强大的马克思列宁主义的史学队伍。
    为了培养这样一支队伍，党向史学工作者提出了全心全意为人民服务的又红又专的方向。
    解放以后，特别是一九五八年以后，广大史学工作者响应党的号召，认真学习毛泽东思想，走出书斋，走出课堂，到工农兵群众中去，到火热的革命斗争中去，参加劳动，参加社会主义革命运动，改造自己的主观世界。这是我国历史学界的一件大好事，一场大革命。
    这样一条革命道路，却遭到了资产阶级学者的抵制、敌视和污蔑。以吴晗同志为代表的一些人有意夸大我们工作中的某些缺点，冷嘲热讽，还诽谤青年教师参加了很多政治运动，书读得不够多，甚至连工具书也不会运用?。说什么历史系较好的毕业生连乾隆是谁也不知道?，等等。总之是“一团糟”。
    他们给史学工作者指的是什么方向呢？
    吴晗同志宣传，“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力，是否能克服挡在他面前的一切困难”?。而对于史学工作者来说，所谓“努力”，所谓克服困难，就是“念书”?，就是“钻到古书堆里去”?。一句话，方向是成名成家，方法是个人奋斗，钻故纸堆。他曾经向青年介绍了不少历史上的农民、穷人顽强学习，成为著名学者的“范例”。他说：这些人在成为学者以后，“阶级成份变了，那是另一回事”?。就是说，只要成为专家学者就行，变成剥削阶级也没有关系。不仅如此，一九六二年，他还现身说法，“兴致勃勃地”介绍自己在抗日战争前夕，“一二九运动”前后，脱离政治，以“惊人的毅力，辛勤的劳动”，“钻到浩瀚的明史资料中去”，成名成家的“经验”，作为向青年史学工作者推荐的活样板?。
    吴晗同志的这种“经验”，在前几年并不是个别的说法。有些人，作报告，写文章，向青年宣传，一个人在三十岁以前还不能成名，他就没有多大希望了；鼓吹青年向资产阶级专家学者看齐，要在年轻的时候依靠“天才”“勤奋”争取放出“光辉”——“成名”“成家”。他们不但这样说了，而且按照自己的路线培养接班人。
    显然，这是一条引导史学工作者脱离实际、脱离政治、埋头读书、追求个人名利的资产阶级道路。
    有人会问：无产阶级不是也需要有真才实学的专家吗？
    是的，无产阶级需要培养众多的有专门知识的历史专家。但是，无产阶级决不能培养新的反动的资产阶级专家。无产阶级的历史科学是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分。对于革命的史学工作者来说，他首先是一个无产阶级战士。他在历史科学方面的知识、修养，只是他为无产阶级政治服务的手段。他所以不断提高自己的专业知识，只能是为了更好地为无产阶级革命事业服务，而绝不是为了积累向党、向人民讨价还价的资本，成为脱离劳动人民，高踞于人民之上的精神贵族。
    要成为一个无产阶级战士，必须不断地、彻底地改造自己的世界观，必须有坚定的阶级立场，充沛的政治热情，敏锐的政治嗅觉。这一点，对史学工作者有特殊重要的意义。因为辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是无产阶级的世界观。对每个史学工作者来说，彻底改变自己的世界观，是掌握科学历史观的基础。只有这样，才能免受封建的、资产阶级的史学潜移默化的影响；才能在历史学科的领域内，坚定地进行兴无灭资的阶级斗争；才能自觉地运用史学这个工具为无产阶级政治服务。
    史学工作者为了使自己的立场、观点、思想感情真正起变化，就必须投入火热的阶级斗争中去。这样做，是不是会妨碍读书呢？党不是提倡认真读书吗？是的，党从来就提倡认真读书。史学工作者研究的对象是历史，要接受前人的经验，更需要读书。但是，党从来就没有提倡过脱离实际的书呆子式的“为读书而读书”的态度，因为这样读下去，一万年也不会成为马克思主义者。
    史学工作者要成为真正的马克思主义者，应该读活书，活读书，读书活。读活书，首先就是到工农群众实际斗争中去，好好读一读阶级斗争的“活书”，在现实阶级斗争中，“研究社会上的各个阶级，研究它们的相互关系和各自状况，研究它们的面貌和它们的心理”?。这是建设史学队伍的根本。其次是好好读一读当前史学战线阶级斗争的“活书”。因为，这是兴无灭资的斗争即社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的一个组成部分，而且对史学工作者有直接的关系。只有读懂了这两本“活书”才能学会活读书，才能带着问题学，为用而学，为革命而学，为阶级斗争而学。只有真正具备了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的活生生的革命气质，掌握了批判的武器，我们才能把印成本本的书读活；才能把握马克思主义著作的精神实质，把书本上学来的马克思主义变成真正是自己的东西；也才能从剥削阶级的史书中发现阶级斗争的客观规律，发现劳动人民创造历史的真谛。
    知识分子改造世界观的关键在于和工农兵群众相结合。一切有志气的史学工作者，都应该响应党的号召，下定决心，打起背包，到工农兵群众中去，滚他一身泥巴，把自己锻炼成为一个名副其实的马克思主义的史学工作者。后　记
    本文主要是评吴晗同志的资产阶级史学路线，因为翦伯赞同志和吴晗同志有许多共同的地方，所以也涉及翦伯赞同志。翦伯赞同志也有一套完整的反马克思主义的资产阶级史学纲领，而且具有更大的迷惑性和欺骗性，影响极为恶劣，我们将另撰专文批判。
