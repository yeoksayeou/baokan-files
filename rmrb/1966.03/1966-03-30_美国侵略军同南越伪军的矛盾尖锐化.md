    The cruelty and baseness are the nature of the American imperialist aggressors. Even to their so-called "allies," the South Vietnamese puppet troops, there are no exceptions.
    On the 10th of this month, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army captured the American "Special Forces" camp in A Shau, 45 kilometers southwest of Hue. According to Western news agencies, when the American aggressor troops fled in defeat, American officers, in order to escape faster themselves, even shot and killed seven puppet soldiers who had escaped with them to the helicopter. At the same time, the American aggressor troops in the helicopter also threw a grenade at a large group of puppet soldiers outside the cabin, killing another ten puppet soldiers. The Associated Press admitted that in the days before that, there had also been incidents of American aggressor troops punching, kicking, and hitting puppet soldiers with rifle butts to prevent them from boarding the helicopter with them to escape.
    The incidents of American aggressor troops massacring puppet troops are by no means accidental. To these cannon fodder they hired, the American aggressors have always used the most barbaric and brutal means without hesitation when they are not needed, especially when they see them becoming a "stumbling block" to their rapid escape. According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the Yongshun campaign in 1964, in order to avoid rescue and cover up their failures, the American troops used helicopters to carry hundreds of wounded puppet soldiers out and throw them into the sea to drown them alive. In the Dongshuai campaign in June 1965, for the same reason, the American aggressors also ordered the burying alive and elimination by other means of many wounded puppet soldiers.
    In battle, American aggressor troops, fearing a beating, often forced puppet troops to be their vanguard. In the Pingye campaign, in order to save one or two American "advisors," they did not hesitate to drive a battalion of puppet marines to their deaths for them. On the other hand, whenever they found the situation unfavorable to them, they always abandoned the puppet troops and fled themselves, or they remained stationed far away without moving. For example, when the puppet troops were surrounded in the Ba Jia, Dongshuai, and De Ji campaigns, they remained stationed without moving, allowing the puppet troops to be wiped out. Not only that, but sometimes when conflicts occurred between them and the puppet troops, they even dispatched aircraft to drop bombs or fire rockets on the puppet troops' heads. On October 23 last year, they fired rockets at the puppet military officers' dormitory at the Xinsanyi Air Force Base for this reason, and on October 30 last year, they fired shells in Bo Lai Mei, killing eleven puppet soldiers. What was particularly vicious was that in Pingjiang Township, Guangyi Province, American Marine Corps soldiers even grabbed two puppet soldiers who had a conflict with them, cut off their ears, dug out their noses, and cut open their abdomens.
    Because of the American aggressor troops' brutality, baseness, and insidiousness, many puppet soldiers have increasingly recognized their true colors, thus turning their guns to strike at the American bandits and return to the embrace of the people. The increasingly frequent incidents of puppet soldiers killing American aggressors recently fully illustrate that the contradictions between the American aggressors and the puppet troops are becoming increasingly acute, and many people in the puppet troops are increasingly waking up.

### 美国侵略军同南越伪军的矛盾尖锐化

    美国侵略军同南越伪军的矛盾尖锐化
    凶残、卑怯，是美帝国主义侵略者的本性。即使对它的所谓“盟军”南越伪军，也毫无例外。
    本月十日，南越解放军攻陷在顺化西南四十五公里的阿绍美国“特种部队”兵营。据西方通讯社报道，当美国侵略军败逃时，美国军官为了自己能够更快地逃生，竟开枪打死了与他们一起逃到直升飞机旁边的七个伪军士兵。与这同时，在直升飞机中的美国侵略军还对机舱外的一大群伪军扔了一颗手榴弹，使另外十个伪军丧命。美联社承认，在这之前几天也曾发生过美国侵略军拳打脚踢和以枪托撞击伪军，不让伪军与他们一起登上直升飞机逃命的事件。
    美国侵略军屠杀伪军的事件绝非偶然的。对于他们雇来的这些炮灰，美国侵略者从来都是在用不着时，特别是眼看已成为他们迅速逃命的“绊脚石”时，就会毫不犹豫地使出最野蛮残暴的手段。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在一九六四年永顺战役中，美军为了免得救护并掩盖自己所遭到的失败，就曾用直升飞机把成百名受伤的伪军士兵载运出去投下大海活活地淹死；一九六五年六月在东帅战役中，由于同样原因，美国侵略者也曾下令活埋和以另一些方式消灭了许多受伤的伪军。
    在战斗中，美国侵略军由于怕挨揍，还经常强迫伪军去为他们打前阵。在平也战役，为了救一两个美国“顾问”，竟不惜驱使成营伪海军陆战队去为他们送死。但另方面，每当发现情况对他们不利时，他们总是扔下伪军不顾而自己逃命，要不就是老远地按兵不动。例如当伪军在巴嘉、东帅、德基等战役中被包围时，他们就是按兵不动，听任伪军被消灭。不仅如此，有时当他们与伪军之间发生矛盾，他们甚至竟然出动飞机，在伪军头上扔炸弹或发射火箭。去年十月二十三日，他们就曾因此对新山一空军基地的伪军军官宿舍发射过火箭，并在去年十月三十日在波来梅发射过炮弹，打死了十一个伪军。特别凶狠的是，在广义省平姜乡，竟发生过美国海军陆战队士兵抓住与他们发生矛盾的两个伪军割耳、挖鼻和剖腹。
    由于美国侵略军的残暴、卑怯和险恶，不少伪军士兵已日益认清了他们的真面目，从而掉转枪口打击美国强盗，投回人民怀抱。最近越来越多地发生的伪军士兵打死美国侵略者的事件，充分说明了美国侵略者和伪军之间的矛盾日益尖锐，伪军中许多人正在日益醒悟过来。
