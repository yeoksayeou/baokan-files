    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th - Our correspondent reports: With the intensified cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union and the changes in Soviet policy towards Japan, the Japanese ruling clique has changed its long-standing anti-Soviet diplomatic tradition and adopted a policy of "approaching the Soviet Union and Japanese-Soviet cooperation."
    The main reason why the Japanese government made a 180-degree turn was that it saw through the fundamental changes in the Soviet Union's internal and external policies. These changes were very useful for the Japanese ruling clique in being pro-American, anti-China, suppressing the Asian national liberation movement, and undermining the Japanese revolutionary cause.
    The changes in the Soviet policy towards Japan not only allowed Japan to pursue the United States' policies of aggression and war more unreservedly, but also allowed it to use modern revisionists to better serve the United States and itself. According to the *Mainichi Shimbun*, the Japanese ruling clique believes that the Soviet Union's "peaceful coexistence is not a temporary diplomatic tactic" but a "firm policy" and "the real deal." It is "passively acknowledging the *de facto* existence of the Japan-US 'security system'" and "using this to dispel Japan's concerns, thereby promoting Japanese-Soviet coexistence." Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina's words and deeds during his visit to the Soviet Union earlier this year also reflected the intentions of the Japanese ruling clique. Shiina emphasized that Japan's basic foreign policy towards the Soviet Union in the future is: "Japanese-Soviet relations must be fair, and Japanese-US cooperation is firm and unshakable."
    Faced with this attitude of the Sato government, the Soviet leadership's response was to further cater to Japan's demands. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko even said to Shiina during his visit to the Soviet Union: "Japanese-Soviet rapprochement will not harm relations with third countries (the United States)." Kyodo News pointed out: This indicates that "the Soviet Union wants to promote 'peaceful coexistence' on the premise of the Japan-US 'security system,' which is a major change in the Soviet Union." The March issue of the magazine *Ekonomika* sharply pointed out that such "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" can enable Japan "to politically and economically utilize the trend of modern revisionism on the basis of forming a subordinate alliance with US imperialism, continuing to assist (the United States) in its aggression in Asia, and promoting the foreign expansion plans of Japanese monopoly capital."
    The Sato government's use of "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" to serve the United States is first manifested in anti-China activities. The Japanese ruling clique openly stated that one of the important purposes of their "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" is to implement the United States' policy of "containing China." Japanese newspapers pointed out that "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" is a variant of US-Soviet cooperation and is being carried out under the US imperialist plot to encircle China. When analyzing the Soviet Union's intensified efforts to court Japan, the *Mainichi Shimbun* pointed out: "One of the Soviet Union's motives for approaching Japan is to counter communist China."
    The Sato government's use of "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" to help the United States suppress the Asian national liberation movement is first manifested in the Vietnam issue. Immediately after US Vice President Humphrey and special envoy Harriman visited Tokyo one after another to urge Japan to serve the US war of aggression against Vietnam, Shiina Etsusaburo, "under orders," publicly clamored during his visit to the Soviet Union that Japan would influence the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue. Shiina, using the tone of an American, said to Gromyko: The Japanese government believes that "it is necessary for the countries involved in the (Vietnam) conflict to start negotiations to reach a peaceful resolution of this conflict as soon as possible." He openly demanded that the Soviet Union use its influence to make the Vietnamese people succumb to the United States' terms at the negotiating table. This Japanese argument was actually expressed in the Japanese-Soviet communiqué. The communiqué blatantly used the absurd wording of "the situation in Vietnam is a threat to peace" to replace the ironclad fact that the US aggression against Vietnam is a threat to peace.
    The "Asian Development Bank," jointly created by US-Japanese reactionaries, is a neo-colonialist tool for expansion and a tool for the United States to use Japan's economic power to support various reactionary regimes in Southeast Asia to suppress national liberation movements. However, in the strong atmosphere of US, Soviet, and Japanese cooperation, the Soviet Union sent representatives to the preparatory meeting of the "Asian Development Bank" held in Bangkok, sitting together with representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Park Chung-hee clique.
    Although the Soviet Union later announced that it would not participate because it was dissatisfied with its position as a mere errand boy in this bank, the head of the Soviet delegation, Borisov, still stated: "The Soviet Union can study the issue of cooperation with this bank. This cooperation can be carried out by providing technical and economic assistance to the construction of some projects in developing countries in Asia and the Far East, or by dispatching experts and training experts to help the organization and work of this bank."
    The Sato government's intensified "economic cooperation" with the Soviet Union also has the ambition to further promote the capitalist development of the Soviet Union and enter the Soviet market. With this goal in mind, Japanese monopoly capital is using the Soviet Union's economic difficulties, attempting to "drive straight into" the Soviet Union through so-called "development of Siberia" and "economic cooperation."
    For Japan domestically, "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" is also beneficial to the Sato government. The *Akahata*, the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, has recently published articles in succession pointing out that "Moscow Radio" beautifies the Sato government, which is helping the US aggression against Vietnam, as the spokesperson for the Japanese people's anti-US aggression in Vietnam. It is helping the Sato government to follow US imperialism, revive militarism and imperialism. The leaders of the CPSU still collude with anti-party groups such as Shiga, providing various kinds of assistance, directly helping them to carry out activities to undermine the Japanese Communist Party and split the Japanese democratic movement. Eisaku Sato certainly understands that "cooperating" with Soviet leaders who both beautify the Japanese government and undermine the Japanese Communist Party and progressive movements is only beneficial to consolidating his rule and undermining the Japanese revolutionary cause.
      "Japanese-Soviet cooperation" shows that modern revisionists can indeed play a role in many aspects that US-Japanese reactionaries themselves cannot.

    佐藤为什么把反苏外交变为日苏合作？
    苏联领导的修正主义政策迎合日本反动派亲美反华需要
    华盛顿公开授意佐藤政府拉拢苏联为美帝侵略越南效劳
    新华社二十四日讯 本社记者报道：随着美苏合作的加紧进行和苏联对日政策的变化，日本统治集团改变了它长期以来的反苏外交传统，采取了“接近苏联、日苏合作”的政策。
    日本政府所以来了个一百八十度的大转弯，主要是看透了苏联在一系列内外政策上发生了根本性变化，而这种变化对于日本统治集团在亲美、反华、镇压亚洲民族解放运动和破坏日本革命事业方面，都是非常有用的。
    苏联对日政策的变化，使日本不仅可以更无顾忌地追随美国的侵略政策和战争政策，而且可以利用现代修正主义者更好地为美国和它自己服务。据《每日新闻》报道，日本统治集团认为，苏联的“和平共处不是暂时的外交策略”，而是“确定不移的方针”，“是真货色”。它是“消极地承认日美‘安全体制’的既成事实”，“依此来打消日本方面的戒心。从而推进日苏共处关系”。日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎在今年初访问苏联期间的言行，也反映了日本统治集团的意图。椎名强调，日本今后对苏外交的基本方针是：“日苏关系必须是公平的，日美合作是坚定而不可动摇的。”
    面对着佐藤政府的这种态度，苏联领导集团的反应是进一步迎合日本的要求。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯甚至对访苏的椎名说：“日苏接近不会损害同第三国（美国）的关系”共同社指出：这表示，“苏联要在日美‘安全体制’的前提下推进‘和平共处’，这是苏联的大变化”。三月号的《经济》杂志尖锐地指出，这样的“日苏合作”，可以使日本“在同美帝国主义结成从属的同盟的基础上，在继续协助（美国）侵略亚洲和推行日本垄断资本的对外扩张计划方面，从政治上和经济上运用现代修正主义的潮流”。
    佐藤政府利用“日苏合作”为美国服务，首先表现在反华上。日本统治集团公开说，它们搞“日苏合作”的重要目的之一，是从执行美国的“遏制中国”政策出发。日本报刊指出，“日苏合作”是美苏合作的变种，是在美帝国主义策划包围中国的要求下进行的。《每日新闻》在分析苏联加紧拉拢日本时指出：“苏联对日接近的动机之一是同共产党中国抗衡”。
    佐藤政府利用“日苏合作”帮助美国镇压亚洲民族解放运动，首先表现在越南问题上。就在美国副总统汉弗莱、特使哈里曼先后到东京活动要日本为美国的侵越战争效劳之后，“衔命”访苏的椎名悦三郎公开叫嚷，日本要在越南问题上影响苏联。椎名完全用美国人的腔调对葛罗米柯说：日本政府认为，“参与（越南）冲突的国家尽快地开始达到和平解决这一冲突的谈判是必要的”。他公开要求苏联利用它的影响使越南人民按照美国的条件在谈判桌上屈服。日本这种论调，居然在日苏公报中有所表达。公报公然用“越南的事态是对和平的威胁”这种荒谬的字样来代替美国侵略越南是对和平的威胁的铁的事实。
    美日反动派合伙搞的“亚洲开发银行”，是一个新殖民主义的扩张工具，也是美国利用日本的经济力量支持东南亚各反动政权镇压民族解放运动的工具。但是，在美、苏、日合作的浓厚气氛中，苏联派代表参加了在曼谷召开的“亚洲开发银行”筹备会议，同蒋介石集团和朴正熙集团的代表坐在一起。
    苏联虽然后来由于不满意它在这个银行中只能当小伙计的地位而宣布不参加，但是苏联代表团团长鲍里索夫仍然表示：“苏联可以研究同这家银行合作的问题。可以通过给予亚洲和远东发展中的国家一些项目的建设以技术和经济协助，也可以采取派遣专家和培养专家的办法来帮助这家银行的组织和工作，来实行这种合作。”
    佐藤政府加紧同苏联的“经济合作”，还有进一步促进苏联国内资本主义化和打入苏联市场的野心。从这一目的出发，日本垄断资本正在利用苏联经济困难，通过所谓“开发西伯利亚”和“经济合作”，企图向苏联“长驱直入”。
    对日本国内来说，“日苏合作”也有利于佐藤政府。日共机关报《赤旗报》最近连续发表文章指出，“莫斯科电台”把帮助美国侵略越南的佐藤政府美化为日本人民反美侵越的代言人，是帮助了佐藤政府追随美帝、复活军国主义和帝国主义；苏共领导至今仍勾结志贺等反党集团，给予种种帮助，直接帮助他们进行破坏日共活动，并分裂日本民主运动。佐藤荣作当然明白，同一面美化日本政府、一面破坏日共和进步运动的苏联领导人“合作”，对于巩固他的统治和破坏日本革命事业，都是有百利而无一害的。
      “日苏合作”说明，现代修正主义者在很多方面确实能够起美日反动派自己所起不了的作用。
