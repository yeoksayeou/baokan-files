    Red Light on the River
    Feng Ke
    It had rained all day, and the rising river water surged from upstream, turning past "Seven Star Shoal" and flowing straight downstream.
    The night deepened, and the wind and rain intensified. At this moment, a person walked from the south bank of "Seven Star Shoal," occasionally shaking a flashlight, walking along the Songhua River bank. Every time he reached a navigation mark, he would concentrate and carefully inspect it.
    This person was named Li Tiegang, an old buoy keeper of the "Seven Star Shoal" buoy section, and also the head of this buoy section. As he walked to Jiangwan, he discovered that buoy number 1005 on the right side of the river channel was missing. At this moment, a thunderclap exploded overhead, and with the help of the lightning, he looked at his watch; the hour hand pointed to midnight. He anxiously thought: In two hours, a passenger ship will pass through "Seven Star Shoal"!
      "Seven Star Shoal" is a dangerous passage on the Songhua River channel. Seven huge rocks are exposed on the river surface in this area. Seen from a distance at night, they look like seven bright stars fallen into the heart of the river, so people gave it the name "Seven Star Shoal." One side of the river surface is a shoal, and the other side is a cliff, and the bottom of the river is densely covered with crisscrossing reefs. In the past, there was a saying here: "Seven Star Shoal, Gate of Hell, boatmen shudder at the sight, it’s nine parts danger in the daytime, and never sail at night." After liberation, accurate navigation marks were erected on the shoal, which avoided danger and made it possible to sail at night.
    Now, buoy number 1005 has been extinguished by the storm, what should be done? Li Tiegang thought nervously: "Stop the ship, wait for the wind and rain to stop, repair the buoy and then let the ship pass... No! I can't, because delaying the passenger ship's voyage due to the buoy is the negligence of the buoy keeper, which is irresponsible to the cause of the Party!" Thinking of this, Li Tiegang decided to repair the buoy light number 1005. He turned back to the buoy section and launched the small boat parked by the river.
    As soon as the small boat rowed into Jiangwan, it was suddenly engulfed by a big wave. Li Tiegang understood in his heart that at this time, if the big wave hit the side of the boat, the boat would "turn over." He calmly and steadily pushed the small boat in a direction perpendicular to the crest of the wave, cutting straight to the top, splitting the waves and going up. At this time, Li Tiegang only had one belief in his heart: charge forward, resolutely repair the buoy, and ensure the absolute safety of ships sailing on the route.
      "Crack!" A thunderbolt split the sky, and Li Tiegang, with the help of the lightning, saw a row of big waves rushing towards him! At this time, even a slight hesitation could cause the people and the boat to be smashed into the river by the big waves. He was seen suddenly standing up from the boat, his legs apart, bending down, his hands tightly gripping the right oar, and with a fierce swing, the small boat was like a dart, pressing on the row of waves and窜了上去! (Note: I have left 蹿了上去 untranslated as it is a very visual term to describe a boat leaping over waves.)
    The small boat leaped on the crest of the wave, Li Tiegang looked up, and suddenly saw the buoy light on the north bank of the river, emitting a red light in the heavy rain, he was sure that buoy light number 1005 was around him. Li Tiegang again fiercely moved the small boat, the small boat turned with the wave, coincidentally, buoy number 1005 was facing Li Tiegang head-on. He moved the oar again, and the small boat and the buoy were almost touching each other. In the blink of an eye, Li Tiegang leaned out and hugged the buoy frame.
    Li Tiegang quickly tied the boat and the buoy frame together with an iron chain. Then, he took out a flashlight from his backpack, turned it on, and saw that the lamp support board under the buoy frame was completely broken, and only a red glass cover remained on the buoy lamp.
    "Woo—woo—woo—", the whistle of a ship sounded from the other side of the mountain.
    "Ah, the ship is coming!" Li Tiegang shone the flashlight on his watch, it was already 1:40 am, and the ship would arrive in another twenty minutes. Time was pressing, and there was no time to repair the buoy light now, emergency measures must be taken. Li Tiegang thought of a way from the broken glass cover. He quickly took out a screwdriver from his backpack, held the flashlight in one hand, and unscrewed the screws with the other, removed the broken glass cover, stuffed the flashlight under the glass cover, secured it, and then covered it with the glass cover, and then pinched the two halves of the glass cover base with both big hands. In this way, a bright red buoy light reappeared at the outpost of "Seven Star Shoal".
    "Woo—woo", a large passenger ship rushed through the wind and rain, and the majestic song "Ode to the Motherland" was being broadcast on the ship's loudspeakers. The passenger ship slowly entered the "Seven Star Shoal" channel, and under the bright spotlight, Li Tiegang clearly saw the three large characters on the ship's side: "Beijing". (Attached image)

    江上红灯
    冯科
    下了一天大雨，上涨着的江水从上游汹涌而来，拐过“七星滩”直向下流奔去。
    夜深了，风雨还在加大。这时，从“七星滩”的南岸走来一个人，不时地晃着手电筒，沿着松花江岸走着。每走到一棵航标下面，就聚精会神地仔细检查一番。
    这个人名叫李铁钢，是“七星滩”航标段的老航标员，也是这个航标段的段长。他走到江湾，发现江心航道上右侧的一○○五号航标不见了。这时候，一个巨雷在他头顶上空炸开，借着电光，他看了一下手表，时针正指着午夜十二点。他焦急地想到：再过两个小时，一艘客轮就要通过“七星滩”了！
      “七星滩”，是松花江航道上的一个险要关口。这一带的江面上露着七块巨大的岩石，黑夜里站在远处一看，就象七颗大亮星掉在江心里，因此人们给它起了个名叫“七星滩”。江面上一边是浅滩，一边是悬崖峭壁，江底下密布着横七竖八的暗礁。过去，这里流传着这样一句话：“七星滩，鬼门关，船工见了心胆寒，白天通过九分险，夜里千万别行船。”解放以后，滩上竖起了准确的航标，这才避免了危险，夜里也能行船了。
    现在，一○○五号航标，被暴风雨打灭了，怎么办？李铁钢紧张地思考着：“把船拦住，等风雨停了，航标修好了再放船过去……不！不能，因为航标耽误了客轮的航行，这是航标员的失职，就是对党的事业不负责！”想到这里，李铁钢决定去把一○○五号航标灯修好。他掉头奔回航标段，划起了停放在江边的小船。
    小船刚划进江湾，突然被大浪裹住了。李铁钢心里明白，这时，大浪如果横击在船舷上，船就要“翻个子”。他冷静沉着地把小船推向与浪头垂直的方向，直切峰顶，劈浪而上。这时，李铁钢的心里只有一个信念：冲上去，坚决要把航标修好，保证航线上行船的绝对安全。
      “咔！”一个响雷把天劈开，李铁钢借着闪电的光一看，发现一排大浪向他冲击过来！这时，只要稍有犹豫，连人带船就可能被大浪砸进大江。只见他猛的从船上站起来，两腿叉开，俯下身子，两手紧握右边船桨，猛力一搬，小船就象一只梭镖，压着那排浪头蹿了上去！
    小船蹿在浪头上，李铁钢一抬头，突然看见江北岸的那盏航标灯，在大雨中放着红光，他肯定一○○五号航标灯就在他的周围。李铁钢把小船又狠劲一搬，小船顺着浪头一转，巧的很，一○○五号航标正和李铁钢打个对面。他又一搬桨，小船和航标几乎碰在一块。说时迟，那时快，李铁钢探出身子，一下子抱住了航标架子。
    李铁钢迅速地把船和航标架子用铁链子拴在一起。而后，从背包里掏出手电筒，打亮一看，航标架子底下的托灯板全部被碰碎了，航标灯只剩下一个红色玻璃罩子。
    “呜——呜——呜——”，山那边响起了轮船的汽笛声。
    “啊，船开过来了！”李铁钢用手电照了一下手表，已是午夜一点四十分，再有二十分钟船就要开到了。时间迫在眉睫，现修理航标灯是来不及了，必须采取紧急措施。李铁钢从破玻璃罩子身上想到了办法。他迅速地从背包里掏出一把螺丝刀，一手拿着电筒，一手把螺丝拧开，揭开坏的玻璃罩子，把手电筒塞进了玻璃罩子底下，放牢靠之后，再把玻璃罩子盖上，然后用两只大手捏住两半的玻璃罩座底。这样一来，一盏通红通红的航标灯又出现在“七星滩”的前哨了。
    “呜——呜”，一艘大客轮冲风冒雨开过来了，船上的广播喇叭正在播送着雄壮的《歌唱祖国》的歌曲。客轮缓缓地驶进了“七星滩”航道，在靠近航标时，在通亮的聚光灯照射下，李铁钢看清了船舷上的三个大字：“北京号”！（附图片）
