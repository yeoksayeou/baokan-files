    Severe Famine, Extremely Dangerous Situation, Government Powerless
    Indian People's Anti-Hunger Struggle Unfolds Nationwide
    According to Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 18th: India is facing its most severe food crisis in twenty years, with the number of people starving nationwide exceeding 100 million (Note: India's total population is over 470 million). A large-scale, continuously developing anti-hunger struggle is unfolding nationwide.
    According to Indian newspapers, anti-hunger demonstrations by the people of Calcutta, India's largest city, and its suburbs began on February 16th and have continued for more than a month. In twenty-six districts around Calcutta, several thousand to tens of thousands of people demonstrate almost daily against the Indian government's food policy. This is the longest and most widely participated anti-hunger struggle in India since the beginning of this year. At the end of January this year, large-scale mass anti-hunger struggles broke out successively in Kerala State and Madhya Pradesh, protesting the Indian government's reduction of food rations. In Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Punjab, mass movements demanding that the government control rising prices and increase food rations have been occurring continuously in recent months.
    In this anti-hunger struggle, Indian workers are the main force. They are severely threatened by unemployment and soaring prices, and are often in a state of semi-starvation. According to greatly reduced official Indian statistics, the number of unemployed nationwide has already increased to 12 million, with 20 million underemployed. Indian workers have launched large-scale strike movements in various places to oppose hunger, oppose layoffs, and demand higher wages. In New Delhi, 150,000 construction workers went on strike on March 10th, demanding higher wages; in Bombay, following a major strike by 350,000 textile workers at the end of last year, another 200,000 workers went on strike in early March this year, bringing the city's textile industry to a near standstill. Even at the Tarapur Atomic Power Station construction site, a strike occurred, with workers destroying equipment and injuring four American "experts."
    Echoing the workers' struggle, farmers, intellectuals, and government employees across India have also joined the anti-hunger movement. In the rural suburbs of Calcutta, 3,000 farmers rose up against the government's price control decree, bravely resisting police suppression; in the capital of Punjab, 2,000 farmers demonstrated against the state government's leasing land to the Birla consortium to build farms. In some places, driven by hunger, farmers ran to the landlords' fields to "rob green crops" and attacked the houses of planters.
    Indian students have become an important force in this anti-hunger movement. In the ongoing anti-hunger struggles in Kerala and Calcutta, large numbers of students participated each time, shouting anti-government slogans, attacking Congress Party offices, and burning police vans used to arrest people.
    India's 1.8 million teachers and staff also face the threat of unemployment and hunger, and they have joined the struggle alongside students. In New Delhi, 5,000 government employees held an anti-hunger march.
    Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who has been in office for less than two months, recently had to admit that India's food problem is "very serious," saying that the current situation is "extremely dangerous" and that the Congress Party has shaken "confidence" in overcoming this crisis.
    In a train station not far from Calcutta, hungry Indians set fire to a train to protest the Indian government's food policy.

    粮荒十分严重  局势极其危险  政府无力应付
    印度人民反饥饿斗争在全国展开
    据新华社十八日讯  新德里消息：印度正面临二十年来最严重的粮食危机，目前全国处于饥饿状态的人口多达一亿以上（注：印度总人口四亿七千多万）。一个声势浩大、持续发展的反饥饿斗争正在全国范围展开。
    据印度报纸报道，印度第一大城市加尔各答和郊区人民反饥饿示威从二月十六日开始，已经持续了一个多月。在加尔各答周围二十六个地区，几乎每天有数千人多至上万人举行示威，反对印度政府的粮食政策。这是今年以来印度各地反饥饿斗争中持续时间最久、参加人数最多的一次。今年一月底，在喀拉拉邦和中央邦，都先后爆发了大规模的群众反饥饿斗争，抗议印度政府削减粮食配给量。在北方邦、西孟加拉邦和旁遮普邦最近几个月来都不断发生群众要求政府控制物价上涨、增加粮食配给量的反饥饿运动。
    在这场反饥饿斗争中，印度工人是主力军。他们受到失业和物价飞涨的严重威胁，经常处于半饥饿状态。据印度官方大大缩小了的统计，目前全国失业人数已经增加到一千二百万，半失业者达两千万。印度工人为反饥饿、反解雇和要求提高工资，在各地展开了大规模罢工运动。在新德里，三月十日有十五万建筑工人举行罢工，要求增加工资；在孟买，继去年年底三十五万纺织工人大罢工之后，今年三月初又有二十万工人举行大罢工，使全市纺织工业几乎全部停止生产。甚至在塔拉普尔原子能电站工地，也发生了罢工事件，工人们捣毁了设备，打伤了四名美国“专家”。
    与工人的斗争相呼应，印度各地农民、知识分子和政府职员也卷入了反饥饿运动。在加尔各答郊区农村，三千农民起来反对政府的物价管制法令，英勇抗击警察的镇压；在旁遮普邦首府，两千农民举行示威，反对邦政府租地给比拉财团修建农场。有些地方农民被饥饿所迫，跑到地主田地“抢青苗”，袭击庄园主的房子。
    印度学生成为这次反饥饿运动的重要力量。在喀拉拉邦和加尔各答的持续反饥饿斗争中，每次都有大批学生参加，他们高呼反政府的口号，袭击国大党办事处，焚毁警察用来捕人的囚车。
    印度一百八十万教职员也同样面临失业和饥饿的威胁，他们和学生并肩投入斗争。在新德里，五千名政府职员举行反饥饿游行。
    上台不到两个月的印度总理甘地夫人，最近不得不承认印度粮食问题“十分严重”，她说：目前局势“极其危险”，国大党已经动摇了克服这种危机的“自信心”。
    印度饥民在离加尔各答不远处的一个火车站放火焚烧火车，抗议印度政府粮食政策。
