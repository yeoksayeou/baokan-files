    Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 29th -- The full text of the speech by Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, at the Lahore Civic Reception on March 29th is as follows:
    Respected Governor of the Province, Respected Minister Bhutto, Respected Vice Chairman Chaudhri Muhammad Hussain, Dear Friends:
    During our friendly visit to Pakistan this time, we have received a warm welcome and gracious hospitality. Yesterday, when we arrived here, the people of Lahore greeted us with boundless enthusiasm. This moving scene vividly reflects the sincere friendship of the Pakistani people towards the Chinese people. Now, the Lahore Municipal Committee has held such a cordial and friendly reception for us, giving us the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life in Lahore. On behalf of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and my colleagues, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and cordial greetings to all the people of Lahore.
    Lahore is a beautiful ancient city of culture. We have visited exquisite buildings and admired famous historical sites here. The genius, wisdom, and brilliant cultural traditions of the Pakistani people have left us with unforgettable impressions.
    Lahore is also a heroic city. Last year, when the Pakistani people rose up to resist Indian armed aggression, the people of Lahore stood on the front lines of the struggle. In the face of enemy invasion, you fought bravely, fearless of sacrifice, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and heroism, and writing a glorious chapter in the history of the Pakistani people's struggle against aggression. Under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, the Pakistani people, united as one, fought with a common hatred against the enemy, defeated the strong with the weak, and the many with the few, finally repelling the invaders and defending the independence and sovereignty of the motherland. Your victory shows that people who fight for justice are invincible. On behalf of the Chinese people, I express my highest respect to the people of Lahore and all the people of Pakistan.
    The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle to safeguard national independence. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. Our principled position is firm and unwavering.
    Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The people in the Indian-occupied area of Kashmir are unwilling to endure the cruel rule any longer and have launched a heroic struggle, which is only natural. As long as India does not stop its oppression, the people of Kashmir will not stop their resistance. As President Ayub Khan pointed out, "There can be no peace between India and Pakistan unless the Kashmir issue is resolved." The right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people must be respected. The just struggle of the Kashmiri people for national self-determination is bound to achieve final victory.
    The Chinese people and the Pakistani people have forged a profound and militant friendship in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. This friendship is built on the basis of mutual sympathy and mutual support, is sincere and selfless, and can withstand any test.
    Support is never one-sided. Our firm support for the just struggle of the Pakistani government and people against Indian armed aggression is our bounden duty. It should be emphasized that the Pakistani government and people have upheld justice in international affairs and have given more support to the Chinese government and people. You have advocated the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and have refuted the various slanders of the imperialist reactionaries against the Chinese people in international forums. Therefore, the Chinese government and people should thank the Pakistani government and people for their support.
    I remember that in 1964, when I accompanied Premier Zhou Enlai on a visit to your heroic city, we said that the friendship between our two peoples has a solid foundation and is by no means a temporary expedient. The facts of the past two years have fully proved this. May our two peoples continue to support each other in the struggles ahead, so that our friendship will be further developed and consolidated.
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people!
    Long live Asian-African solidarity!
    Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    陈毅副总理在拉合尔市民招待会上讲话
    中巴人民深厚的战斗友谊经得起考验
    拉合尔欢迎盛况激动人心体现了巴基斯坦人民的真挚友谊
    新华社拉合尔二十九日电  中华人民共和国国务院副总理陈毅二十九日在拉合尔市民招待会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的省督阁下，尊敬的布托部长阁下，尊敬的乔杜里·穆罕默德·侯赛因副主席阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    我们这次到巴基斯坦进行友好访问，受到了热烈的欢迎和殷勤的接待。昨天，当我们到达这里的时候，千千万万的拉合尔人民热情洋溢地欢迎我们。这种激动人心的情景，生动地体现了巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的真挚友谊。现在，拉合尔市政委员会又为我们举行了这样亲切友好的招待会，使我们有机会同拉合尔各界人士会见。我代表刘少奇主席和我的同事们，向全体拉合尔人民表示衷心的感谢和亲切的问候。
    拉合尔是一个美丽的文化古城。我们在这里参观了精美的建筑，欣赏了著名的古迹。巴基斯坦人民的天才、智慧和光辉的文化传统，给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    拉合尔又是一座英雄的城市。去年巴基斯坦人民奋起抵抗印度武装侵略的时候，拉合尔人民站在斗争的最前线。你们在强敌侵犯的情况下，奋勇抗战，不怕牺牲，表现了高度的爱国主义精神和英雄气概，为巴基斯坦人民反抗侵略的斗争史写下了光辉的篇章。巴基斯坦人民在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，万众一心，同仇敌忾，以弱胜强，以少胜多，终于击退了侵略者，捍卫了祖国的独立和主权。你们的胜利表明，为正义而斗争的人民是不可战胜的。我代表中国人民向拉合尔人民和全体巴基斯坦人民表示崇高的敬意。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立的斗争。过去是这样，今后还是这样。我们这一原则立场是坚定不移的，是不可动摇的。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。克什米尔印占区人民不愿意再忍受残酷的统治，掀起了英勇的斗争，这是理所当然的。印度一天不停止压迫，克什米尔人民就一天不会停止反抗。正如阿尤布·汗总统所指出的，“除非克什米尔问题得到解决，否则印巴之间就不可能有和平”。克什米尔人民的自决权利必须得到尊重。克什米尔人民争取民族自决的正义斗争，是一定会取得最后胜利的。
    中国人民和巴基斯坦人民，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。这种友谊是在互相同情、互相支持的基础上建立起来的，是真诚无私的，是经得起考验的。
    支持从来不是单方面的。我们坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反抗印度武装侵略的正义斗争，是我们应尽的义务。应该强调指出的是，巴基斯坦政府和人民在国际事务中，主持正义，给予了中国政府和人民更多的支持。你们主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，在国际讲坛上驳斥了帝国主义反动派对中国人民的各种诬蔑。因此，中国政府和人民应该感谢巴基斯坦政府和人民的支持。
    曾记得，一九六四年我陪同周恩来总理访问你们这座英雄城市的时候，我们讲过我们两国人民的友谊有坚实的基础，决不是一时的权宜之计。两年来的事实，完全证明了这一点。愿我们两国人民在今后的斗争中继续互相支持，使我们的友谊更加发展、更加巩固。
    中巴两国人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
    三月二十九日，西巴基斯坦省首府拉合尔的巴基斯坦—中国友好协会举行盛大午宴，招待刘少奇主席。刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理兼外交部长和夫人，外交部副部长章汉夫以及刘少奇主席的其他随行人员出席了午宴。图为陈毅副总理兼外交部长讲话。
