    The U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage its defeat in South Vietnam, is actively plotting to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified the expansion of the war of aggression in Laos, which is an important component of this conspiracy.
    The spearhead of U.S. aggression is first directed at the liberated areas of central and lower Laos in order to use this area as a bridgehead linking Thailand and its main battlefield - South Vietnam. Since September of last year, under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, the Lao right-wing army, commanded by U.S. military "advisors" and in coordination with the Thai army, launched a so-called "dry season offensive" against the central and lower Laos areas, attempting to connect this area with Thailand and the South Vietnam battlefield. This offensive was defeated by the heroic struggle of the Lao patriotic army and people. At the same time, U.S. aircraft have also stepped up bombing of the liberated areas. Since the end of November last year, U.S. aircraft taking off from U.S. aircraft carriers in the South China Sea and bases in Thailand, South Vietnam and Guam, as well as aircraft of South Vietnamese and Thai puppets, have been carrying out indiscriminate bombing of the liberated areas of upper, central, and lower Laos every day. By January of this year, just as the Johnson administration was playing the "peace talks" conspiracy, the bombing of Laos had reached an unprecedented level of frenzy. According to the Associated Press, as many as 300 U.S. aircraft were dispatched every day. In particular, the recent bombing of Phongsaly by U.S. aircraft indicates that the aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism have already extended to the whole of Laos.
    While intensifying the bombing, under the planning of U.S. imperialism, the Lao right-wing forces dispatched a large number of troops and some Thai infantry and artillery units, under the cover of U.S. aircraft, and launched another frenzied offensive against the Lao patriotic army and people in the Phou Kout and Phou Song areas of Xieng Khouang Province's liberated area, starting on February 4. At the same time, since February 9, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have also concentrated nearly ten battalions of troops and launched large-scale "sweeps" against the Tateng and Lao Ngam areas of the Bolovens Plateau. Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Lao Patriotic Front, pointed out that this frenzied offensive by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs against the Lao liberated areas "is part of the U.S. conspiracy to introduce its troops into Laos to directly occupy the central and lower Laos areas."
    In order to expand the war of aggression against Laos, since the second half of last year, U.S. imperialism has stepped up the transportation of large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials to Laos. The number of U.S. military personnel in Laos has increased to more than 2,000, and the Lao right-wing army has been expanded from 30,000 to more than 70,000. It is particularly noteworthy that the United States is plotting to directly send troops to invade Laos. On December 21 last year, a U.S. State Department spokesman declared that the U.S. military in South Vietnam "has the right" at any time to attack and invade the territories of Laos and Cambodia under the fabricated pretext of "self-defense" and "pursuit of the Viet Cong." Now, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, is gathering Lao puppet troops to launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, and on the other hand, is spreading rumors to create a "pretext" for the U.S. military to invade Laos. Recently, U.S. Vice President Humphrey also went to Vientiane for activities. A commentary on the "Voice of Laos" radio station pointed out that Humphrey's task in Vientiane was to "intensify the conspiracy to send U.S. troops into Laos and further expand the war of aggression against Laos."
    U.S. imperialism is stepping up its aggression against Laos, trying to turn Laos into a second South Vietnam. However, this will not only not save it from its predicament in South Vietnam, but on the contrary, it will put another noose around its neck. The Lao people have long warned that if U.S. imperialism dares to directly send troops to invade Laos, Laos will become a sea of ​​hatred that buries the American aggressor bandits.

    美国加紧扩大对老挝的侵略
    美帝国主义为了挽救它在南越的败局，正在积极策划把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。最近，美帝国主义加紧扩大侵略老挝的战火，就是这个阴谋的一个重要组成部分。
    美国侵略矛头，首先指向中寮和下寮的解放区，以便把这个地区作为联结泰国和它的主要战场——南越之间的桥头堡。去年九月以来老挝右派军队在美帝的唆使下，由美国军事“顾问”指挥，配合泰国军队，对中、下寮地区发动了所谓“旱季攻势”，妄图把这个地区同泰国和南越战场连成一片。这个攻势在老挝爱国军民的英勇打击下，遭到了失败。同时，美国飞机也加紧轰炸解放区。从去年十一月底以来，由南中国海上美国航空母舰及在泰国、南越和关岛基地起飞的美国飞机和南越、泰国的仆从飞机，每天对上寮、中寮和下寮的解放区进行狂轰滥炸。到今年一月，正当约翰逊政府玩弄“和谈”阴谋的时候，对老挝的轰炸却达到了空前猖狂的程度。据美联社报道，每天出动的美国飞机，达三百架之多。特别是最近美国飞机对丰沙里市的轰炸，表明美帝国主义的侵略魔爪已经伸到整个老挝。
    在飞机加紧轰炸的同时，在美帝国主义的策划下，老挝右派出动了大量兵力和一些泰国步兵、炮兵部队，由美国飞机掩护，从二月四日开始，对川圹省解放区的富科特山和富松地区的老挝爱国军民再度发动了疯狂的进攻。同时，从二月九日以来，美帝国主义及其走狗还集中了近十个营的兵力，向波罗芬高原的塔顿、寮岸等地区发动了大规模“扫荡”。老挝爱国战线党总书记富米·冯维希曾指出，美帝国主义及其走狗这次对老挝解放区的猖狂进攻，“是美国阴谋把它的军队引进老挝来直接侵占中寮和下寮地区的计划的一部分。”
    为了扩大对老挝的侵略战火，从去年下半年以来，美帝国主义加紧向老挝运进大批武器、弹药和其他战争物资，在老挝的美国军事人员已增加到两千多人，并把老挝右派军队从三万人扩充到七万多人。特别值得注意的是，美国正在阴谋直接出兵侵入老挝。去年十二月二十一日美国国务院发言人就宣称，在南越的美军不论任何时候都“有权”以它所捏造的“自卫”和“追击越共”的理由，袭击和侵犯老挝和柬埔寨领土。现在，美帝国主义一方面纠集老挝傀儡军队大举进攻解放区，另一方面则大肆造谣，为美军侵入老挝制造“借口”。最近美国副总统汉弗莱又到万象活动。“老挝之声”电台的评论指出，汉弗莱到万象的任务是“加紧策划把美国军队派进老挝和进一步扩大侵略老挝战争的阴谋。”
    美帝国主义加紧扩大对老挝的侵略，想把老挝变成第二个南越。但是，这不但不会解救它在南越的困境，相反，只会在它的脖子上再套上一条绞索。老挝人民早已发出警告：如果美帝国主义胆敢直接派兵入侵老挝，老挝将成为埋葬美国侵略强盗的仇恨火海。
