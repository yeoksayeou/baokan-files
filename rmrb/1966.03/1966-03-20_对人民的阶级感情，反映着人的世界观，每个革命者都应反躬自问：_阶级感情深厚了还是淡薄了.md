    On class feelings towards the people, reflecting one's worldview, every revolutionary should ask themselves:
    Are my class feelings deepened or weakened?
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause and extremely enthusiastic towards the masses of people, dedicating his red heart unconditionally to the Party and the masses. However, I lack the deep class feelings towards the masses and cadres that Jiao Yulu possessed. Although I often educate cadres to pay attention to the suffering of the masses, I speak more and do less; I rarely take action myself. Last October, when I led a work team to the Dasi Ping Commune to arrange the lives of the masses, I rarely went deep into the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to visit, but floated on the surface listening to reports and deploying work. In particular, regarding the life difficulties of some people, I sometimes mistakenly believed that "this is inevitable," and therefore did not actively try to find ways to help solve them. Jiao Yulu led office cadres in the freezing winter to visit the poor and lower-middle peasants with relief funds and materials, asking about their well-being. When I went to work in production teams, I mostly chatted with team cadres, wandered around the fields, and rarely contacted poor and lower-middle peasants, and rarely visited their homes. Our usual work style is even more superficial, with more issuing of documents and holding meetings; when dealing with some problems, we excessively occupy the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the masses, unintentionally increasing the burden on the masses. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's noble qualities, I feel very ashamed of these thoughts and work styles that are divorced from the people.
    Sometimes, I also care about the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but in solving the difficulties of poor and lower-middle peasant households, I mostly emphasize material assistance, and do not pay attention to strengthening political and ideological work, and mostly reach out for relief funds and materials. Countless facts have repeatedly proven that class feelings towards the people must first be based on believing in and relying on the masses. To solve the life difficulties of the people, we must rely on the people themselves to liberate themselves, relying on the masses' self-reliance, not simply on material support, let alone on our "bestowal".
    In the past, I often asked myself: Compared with when I joined the revolution, are my class feelings with the people now deepened or weakened? (This question is well asked, it is a manifestation of a revolutionary's consciousness. If our county committee leaders can all frequently ask themselves this question, be vigilant, and truly demand themselves with high standards, we can always maintain the closest relationship with the broad masses of people.) Before studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I always thought it was not bad. After studying, repeatedly thinking, examining, and comparing, I was shocked and deeply felt that I was stained with a lot of non-proletarian thoughts and work styles. Since becoming a leading cadre, I have not worked as hard and diligently as before. Take the issue of writing summary reports, for example. Five or six years ago, I rarely asked others to draft them. Whether they were well written or badly written, I always used my own brain and hands to write them. But in recent years, the word "diligent" has decreased and the word "lazy" has increased. I personally do far fewer things myself. For another example, in the past, when certain shortcomings or problems arose in my work, violating the interests of the masses, I felt very distressed and ashamed once I discovered them or received criticism from higher authorities, and therefore I corrected them quickly. But in recent years, that feeling of "distress" and "shame" has greatly decreased. Not only that, I always thought to myself: "It is impossible to completely avoid these problems," and therefore I forgave myself and relaxed my ideological remolding. These are all manifestations of a fading red heart and a weakening will, which are incompatible with the noble qualities of a Communist Party member.
    From Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I have more deeply realized that for a Communist Party member and revolutionary to truly reach the standard of "infinite loyalty to the revolution and dedicated service to the people," they must first have a high level of proletarian political consciousness and deep class feelings towards the people. Only in this way can they fight to the end for the revolutionary cause as always, and the revolutionary red heart will always be as fiery as youth. I am determined to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example in the practical struggle of the second half of my life, forever love the people, care for the masses, never separate from the people, be wholeheartedly loyal, and forge ahead courageously, and fight to the end for the liberation of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    对人民的阶级感情，反映着人的世界观，每个革命者都应反躬自问：
    阶级感情深厚了还是淡薄了
    焦裕禄同志对革命事业无限忠诚，对人民群众极端热忱，把一颗红心无条件献给了党，献给了人民群众。而我对人民群众和干部，却缺乏象焦裕禄那种深厚的阶级感情。虽然也时常教育干部注意关心群众的疾苦，但是在口头上说的多，身体力行亲自动手做的少。去年十月初，我带领工作组到大四平公社安排群众生活的时候，自己很少深入到贫农下中农家去访问，只是浮在上面听取汇报和部署工作。特别是对某些群众的生活困难，有时还错误地认为“这是难免的”，因而也就不去积极想方设法帮助解决。焦裕禄在十冬寒天率领机关干部拿着救济款物到贫农下中农家去问寒问暖，而我下乡到生产队里去工作，也多是找队干部扯扯唠唠，到地里转转，四处走走看看，很少与贫农下中农接触，很少去贫农下中农家里访问。我们平时的工作作风，更是浮在上面，发文件和开会多；在处理一些问题时，过多的占用群众的人力、物力和财力，无意之中加重了群众的负担。这些脱离人民群众的思想作风，与焦裕禄同志高尚的品质相比较，感到非常惭愧。
    有时，我也关心贫农下中农的生活，但是在解决贫农下中农困难户的生活疾苦上多是强调物质帮助，不注意加强政治思想工作，对上也多是伸手要救济款物。无数事实一再证明，对人民群众的阶级感情，首先必须建立在相信群众，依靠群众的基础上。解决人民群众的生活困难，是要依靠人民群众自己来解放自己，靠群众的自力更生，不能是单纯靠物质支援，更不是靠我们的“恩赐”。
    我过去也常常反躬自问：现在同人民群众的阶级感情，与参加革命时比，是深厚了还是淡薄了？（这个问题提得好，这是一个革命者自觉性的表现。我们的县委领导同志如果都能这样经常地反问自己，警惕自己，真正用高标准要求自己，我们就能永远与广大人民群众保持最密切的关系。）没有学习焦裕禄同志的事迹以前，总以为还不错，学习之后，翻来复去的思索、检查对照，不禁使我大吃一惊，深深感到，在我身上，沾染了不少非无产阶级的思想作风。从当上领导干部以来，也不象从前那样吃大苦耐大劳和兢兢业业艰苦奋斗了。就拿写总结报告这个问题来说，在五、六年以前，很少叫别人起草，不管是写好写坏，总是自己动脑动手来写，而这几年，却减少了个“勤”字，增加了个“懒”字，自己亲自动手的事情减少了很多很多。再比方，在以前工作上产生某些缺点毛病、违反了群众利益，一经发现或受到上级批评，感到非常痛心，惭愧，因而改正的也就快：而这几年，那种“痛心”“惭愧”的心情大大减少了。不但如此，自己总以为：“产生这些问题是不能完全避免的”，因而也就原谅了自己，放松了自己的思想改造。这些都是红心减色，意志衰退的表现，与一个共产党员高尚品质格格不入。
    从焦裕禄同志的事迹中，使我更深刻地认识到，一个共产党员和革命者，真正达到“对革命无限忠诚，为人民鞠躬尽瘁”的标准，首先必须要有高度的无产阶级的政治觉悟，对人民群众要有深厚的阶级感情。只有这样，才能为革命事业终身如一日的奋斗到底，革命的红心永远象青春般的火热。我决心在后半生的实践斗争中，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，永远热爱人民，关心群众，一时一刻也不脱离人民群众，赤胆忠心，勇往直前，为中国人民和全世界人类的解放事业奋斗到底。
