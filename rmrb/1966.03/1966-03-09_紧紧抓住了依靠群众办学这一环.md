    Firmly Grasping the Key Link of Running Schools by Relying on the Masses
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) The Gengdu primary schools of Dazhuo Commune in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, have become better and better after a period of consolidation and improvement. In the work of consolidating and improving Gengdu primary schools, this commune has extensively mobilized the masses, not only consolidating some unconsolidated schools, but also restoring and newly establishing ten Gengdu primary schools. Now, there are a total of forty-one Gengdu primary schools and fifty-three full-time primary schools in the commune. Of the commune's ninety-nine natural villages, almost every village has a primary school, initially forming a primary school education network suitable for the needs of the masses.
    In the past, the enrollment rate of school-age children in Dazhuo Commune was relatively low. After more than forty Gengdu primary schools were established in 1964, the enrollment rate increased to 85 percent. By September 1965, after a general survey, it was found that some schools had not fully mobilized the masses when they were established, and there were many problems. Some had closed, and the enrollment rate of school-age children had declined somewhat again. In this pilot project of consolidation and improvement, they firmly grasped the key link of relying on the masses to run schools, paid attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, and let the masses be the masters of the schools. The Majiashan Production Team of Dazhuo Brigade had a Gengdu primary school that was closed. After publicizing the nature of Gengdu primary schools and the principle that the masses should be the masters in running schools, the masses actively participated in running schools, and the closed school was quickly restored. The Liuqiao Village Gengdu primary school of Yuntang Brigade had more than twenty students, but it was not consolidated; there was also a full-time people-run primary school in the village with only eighteen students. After discussion by cadres and the masses, it was decided to merge the two schools, adapt to the different situations of the students, and rationally arrange the class times for the Gengdu class and the full-time class. This not only met the requirements of the masses but also reduced the economic burden of the production team. As a result, not only were the original students retained, but six more students were added.
      After the schools are established, whether they proceed from the actual situation in the countryside and are run in a way that meets the needs of the peasants is an important key to whether the schools can be consolidated. In the consolidation work, Dazhuo Commune created some flexible and diverse forms of schooling. This commune is a hilly area, and the masses are scattered. Generally, natural villages have forty or fifty households, and small villages have only ten or twenty households. There are many children in large villages, so they set up classes for teaching; there are few children in small villages, so they set up joint schools by village and teachers teach on a circuit. Zhao Jiabian Village of Zhuxiang Brigade has seventeen students, and Xiadianzi Village has ten students. The two villages are about one mile apart, so they implemented joint schooling, with teachers teaching in Zhao Jiabian Village in the morning and in Xiadianzi Village in the afternoon. Wazi Village of Dingcun Brigade has three production teams, seven small natural villages, and ninety-three households living scattered along the mountain沟. More than twenty school-age children have to watch the door and do housework and cannot leave home to study. The Gengdu primary school teachers divided the whole village into seven points and taught on a circuit, and as a result, the number of students increased from eighteen to twenty-two. The schools also adopted many methods to facilitate children's schooling. Students who need to take care of younger siblings at home are allowed to bring their siblings to school; for children who graze cattle, when they are grazing all day, they are taught a few words at noon; when the cattle are plowing the fields, they are taught all day. Teachers, according to the opinions of the commune members, make the teaching time follow production and change with the seasons, leaving time for children who need to go home to help cook or do other housework.
    With the flexible and diverse forms of schooling, new contradictions have arisen in teaching. Students have different study times, some long and some short, different learning progress, some fast and some slow, plus students have different cultural foundations and different abilities to accept, and some students can only study intermittently during the slack season. In this case, the old multi-grade teaching methods can no longer adapt. At present, a small number of schools are carrying out reform experiments. Tengjia Gengdu Primary School is trying the following methods: First, implement "study room" style teaching. The whole class of twenty-two students is divided into five groups according to their level. The teacher teaches one group and then another group. Those who are not in class at the time review or do homework on the side. Second, implement mid-term enrollment of transfer students. Students can join whichever group they can read, and students who study well are allowed to skip groups. Third, implement single-subject advancement to take care of students with poor acceptance ability. Individual students who have difficulty learning arithmetic will temporarily only learn Chinese and not arithmetic. Fourth, implement "book" and class promotion at any time, without being restricted by the academic year. Some students learn arithmetic quickly. Within one semester, after finishing the first book, they can continue to study the second and third books. The effects of these methods after preliminary trials are very good, and the masses are very welcome.
    Dazhuo Commune regards the establishment of a revolutionary and laborized "volunteer" teaching force as an important link in consolidating and running Gengdu primary schools well. Many brigade party branches not only actively lead the running of schools but also attach great importance to doing political and ideological work, organizing Gengdu primary school teachers to study Chairman Mao's works. Wen Limei, a teacher at Xujiabian Gengdu Primary School, studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and moved the classroom four times without complaint. Once, she moved to a cowshed full of dung ash, and she cleaned it herself. Shao Liangmei, a teacher at Shangba Gengdu Primary School, studied "Serve the People" with questions in mind. She thought of the words "completely" and "thoroughly" in the article and realized that there were still two children from poor and lower-middle peasants in the village who were not enrolled in school, so she ran to find their parents and helped solve the difficulties of the children not being able to go to school. Some teachers insist on delivering lessons to students who cannot come to school every day, and some teachers use their own homes as classrooms, carrying students on their backs to and from school on rainy days.
    In order to help Gengdu primary school teachers quickly improve their political and professional level, the commune also organized a roving guidance group including two public primary school teachers and one demobilized soldier. This roving guidance group regards the organization of teachers' political study as a regular central task. Whenever they arrive at a school, they first publicize the significance of running Gengdu primary schools to the teachers, explaining that teaching in Gengdu primary schools is doing revolution. They also organize teachers to study books and articles such as "Wang Jie's Diary" and printed and distributed the advanced deeds of two Gengdu primary school teachers in the commune. After studying, many teachers have made rapid progress and have begun to establish the idea of teaching for the revolution, being able to teach the children of poor and lower-middle peasants with deep class feelings, and actively studying their profession, determined to teach students well. The roving guidance group not only grasps teaching business but also helps solve difficulties in running schools, and if problems are found, they promptly discuss solutions with the brigade party branch and the school running unit and report to the commune. When conducting business guidance, they adopt a combination of individual and collective methods. Problems of a universal nature found in individual tutoring are given collective tutoring and demonstration teaching. The Gengdu primary school teachers of this commune are also linked to full-time school teachers, learning from each other and improving together. Gengdu primary school teachers learn from the teaching experience of full-time primary school teachers, improving their professional level; full-time primary schools absorb the revolutionary spirit of running schools and teaching in Gengdu primary schools, promoting teaching reform.
    In the work of consolidating Gengdu primary schools, Dazhuo Commune also pays attention to relying on local cadres and the masses to rationally arrange the wages and benefits of teachers. The vast majority of teachers insist on participating in collective productive labor and have set labor tasks. In this way, it not only helps the intellectualization and laborization of intellectuals but also reduces the economic burden on parents, collectives, and the state. (Attached photo)

    紧紧抓住了依靠群众办学这一环
    新华社南京八日电  江苏省句容县大卓公社的耕读小学经过一个时期的巩固提高工作，越办越好。这个公社对耕读小学进行巩固提高的工作中，广泛地发动群众，不仅使一部分不巩固的学校巩固下来了，而且还恢复和新办了十所耕读小学。现在全公社共有四十一所耕读小学，五十三所全日制小学。全公社九十九个自然村，基本做到每村有一所小学，初步形成一个适合群众需要的小学教育网。
    大卓公社过去学龄儿童入学率比较低。一九六四年办起四十多所耕读小学以后，入学率增加到百分之八十五。到一九六五年九月，经过普遍调查，发现有些学校开办时没有充分发动群众，存在不少问题，有的停办了，学龄儿童入学率又有些下降。在这次巩固提高的试点工作中，他们紧紧抓住依靠群众办学这一环，注意倾听群众意见，让群众做学校的主人。大卓大队马家山生产队原有一所耕读小学停办了，经过向群众宣传耕读小学的性质和办学要群众当家作主的道理，群众积极参加办学，停办的学校很快就恢复了。云塘大队柳桥村的耕读小学有二十多名学生，但不巩固；村上又有一所全日制民办小学，只有十八名学生。经过干部和群众讨论确定，把两所小学合并起来，适应不同学生的情况，合理安排耕读班和全日制班的上课时间。这样既符合群众的要求，又减轻了生产队的经济负担，结果不仅原有的学生留住了，还增加了六名学生。
      学校办起来以后，是不是从农村实际出发，办得适合农民需要，这是使学校能不能巩固的一个重要关键。在巩固工作中，大卓公社创造了一些灵活多样的办学形式。这个公社是一个丘陵地区，群众居住分散，一般自然村有四五十户，小村只有一二十户。大村儿童多，他们就设班教学；小村儿童少，他们就按村设点联合办校，教师巡回教学。朱巷大队赵家边村有十七个学生，下佃子村有十个学生，两村相距约一里路，于是就实行联合办校，教师上午在赵家边村上课，下午到下佃子村上课。丁村大队洼子村有三个生产队，七个小自然村，九十三户人家沿山沟分散居住，有二十多个学龄儿童要看门、做家务事，不能离家读书。耕读小学教师就把全村分为七个点，巡回分散教学，结果学生由十八人发展到二十二人。各校还采取许多办法，便利儿童上学。对需要在家看弟妹的学生，允许他们把弟妹带到学校来；对放牛的孩子，当他们全天放牧时，就用中午时间教他们几个字；牛耕田时，就全天教。教师们根据社员群众的意见，使教学时间跟着生产走，随着季节变，给需要回家帮助烧饭或做其他家务事的孩子留出时间。
    随着办学形式的灵活多样，教学上又产生了新的矛盾。学生的学习时间有长有短，学习进度有快有慢，加上学生的文化基础不同，接受能力不一，还有的学生只能在农闲时断断续续学习。在这种情况下，老的复式教学方法已经不能适应了，目前少数学校正在进行改革试验。腾家耕读小学正在试行以下几种办法：一、实行“书房”式教学。全班二十二个学生，按程度分成五组，教师教完一组再教一组，当时不上课的就在一旁复习或做作业。二、实行学期中招收插班生，能读哪组插哪组，学习好的允许跳组。三、实行单科独进，照顾接受能力差的学生学习能消化。个别学生学算术有困难，就暂时只学语文，不学算术。四、实行随时升“册”升班，不受学年限制。有的学生算术学得快，在一个学期内，学完第一册可以接着学第二册和第三册。这些办法初步试行后的效果很好，群众很欢迎。
    大卓公社把建立一支革命化、劳动化的“志愿兵”教师队伍，看作是巩固和办好耕读小学的一个重要的环节。不少大队党支部不仅积极领导办学，而且还很重视做政治思想工作，组织耕读小学教师学习毛主席著作。徐家边耕读小学教师闻丽美学习了《愚公移山》，四次搬教室毫无怨言。有一次搬到一间满是粪灰的牛棚里，她就自己动手，打扫得干干净净。上坝耕读小学教师邵良梅带着问题学习《为人民服务》以后，她从文章中的“完全”、“彻底”四个字联想到村上还有两个贫下中农孩子没有入学，就跑去找到家长，帮助解决孩子不能上学的困难。有的教师坚持天天给不能来校的学生送字上门，有的教师把自己的家当教室，在下雨天把学生背了来，送回去。
    为了帮助耕读小学教师迅速提高政治业务水平，公社还组织了一个包括两名公办小学教师和一名复员军人的巡回辅导组。这个巡回辅导组把组织教师的政治学习当作经常性的中心任务。他们每到一校，首先向教师宣传办耕读小学的意义，讲教耕读小学就是干革命的道理。还组织教师学习《王杰日记》等书籍和文章，并且印发了本公社两个耕读小学教师的先进事迹。经过学习，许多教师进步很快，开始树立为革命而教书的思想，能够带着深厚的阶级感情来教贫下中农的孩子，并且积极钻研业务，立志教好学生。巡回辅导组不仅抓教学业务，而且帮助解决办学中的困难，发现问题，就及时和大队党支部、办学单位研究解决，并向公社汇报。进行业务辅导时，采取个别与集中相结合的办法。在个别辅导中发现了教学中带普遍性的问题就进行集中辅导，示范教学。这个公社的耕读小学教师还和全日制学校教师挂钩，互相学习，共同提高。耕读小学教师学习全日制小学教师的教学经验，提高了业务水平；全日制小学吸取耕读小学办学和教学的革命精神，促进了教学改革。
    大卓公社在巩固耕读小学的工作中，还注意依靠当地干部和群众，合理安排教师的工资待遇。绝大部分教师都坚持参加集体生产劳动，定了劳动任务。这样，既有助于知识分子革命化劳动化，又减轻了家长、集体和国家的经济负担。（附图片）
