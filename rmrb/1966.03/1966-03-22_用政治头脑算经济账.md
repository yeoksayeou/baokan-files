    Calculate Economic Accounts with Political Acumen
    Wang Baoyu, Chief Accountant's Office, Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill
    How should accounts be calculated? There are two ways: one is to calculate economic accounts by highlighting politics, and the other is to only calculate economic accounts and not political accounts. The same account, calculated using two different methods, can yield two completely different results, the former promoting and the latter hindering.
    This year, the mass production of "Anping No. 1" heavy rail is a great joy for our factory. However, from the perspective of cost management, we also have concerns. Because the production of this heavy rail brings a series of difficulties throughout the production process. Due to the hardness of the steel, the output is low, and the consumption of materials such as fuel, materials, tools, and power will also increase accordingly. We made a detailed calculation that producing this heavy rail this year will result in a cost overrun of 380,000 yuan.
    If we hadn't calculated it, it would have been fine, but after calculating it, it was truly frightening. What were we afraid of? We were afraid of not completing the targets and losing the "all-red" (complete fulfillment of all targets). How to deal with it? Conflicts arose, so we turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao told us: "In the production movement, the conservative, purely financial viewpoint of not paying attention to economic development but only calculating on expenditure is wrong."
    Chairman Mao's words touched my heart, and I recalculated the account: due to the good performance of "Anping No. 1" heavy rail, which is wear-resistant and durable, its service life is extended by at least 50 percent. According to this calculation: First, it saves thousands of yuan in investment in railway construction; Second, it increases production capacity by 12 percent; Third, it saves a lot of raw materials; Fourth, it saves railway replacement costs and repair costs. Adding up the above four accounts is a considerable sum. It can be seen that the economic value exchanged for the 380,000 yuan increase in our factory's production costs is not one, not dozens, but hundreds of 380,000 yuan.
    Without calculating, you don't know; with calculation, your thinking improves. From the accounting work of "Anping No. 1" heavy rail, I realized that we must do accounting for 600 million people. This is the fundamental prerequisite for doing a good job in accounting in the increase production and practice economy movement. Accounting involves recording, calculating, reporting, and managing accounts. It can be said that you are a good accountant if you record the accounts clearly, calculate them correctly, report them accurately, and manage them well. But how can we achieve this? It is not enough to only have calculation skills; first, there must be politics in the mind. Only by using politics to command business can we achieve clear records, correct calculations, accurate reports, and good management. We are accountants handling the cause of the proletariat, so we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, thoroughly eliminate the influence of capitalist management thinking, and eradicate the metaphysical, purely business viewpoint.
    Implementing economic accounting and paying attention to economic results are the basic principles of socialist enterprise management. However, whether we can correctly handle the relationship between the small picture and the big picture is an indispensable link in implementing the general line of socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It is not right to emphasize the completion of enterprise economic indicators while affecting the completion of overall economic indicators. The good completion of the economic indicators of an enterprise often cannot be fully reflected in the national economic value. However, the national accounting results include the enterprise's accounting results. Taking the cost overrun of "Anping No. 1" heavy rail as an example, it is not cost-effective from the perspective of the enterprise, but it is of great benefit from the perspective of national construction. This requires that financial and accounting personnel be in the factory but calculate for the whole country. Otherwise, they will only calculate within a small local circle, often being considered profitable accounts, but in reality, they are losing accounts, which will damage the country's economic construction.

    用政治头脑算经济账
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂总会计师室　王宝玉
    账，应当怎样算？有两种算法：一种是用突出政治来算经济账，另一种是只算经济账，不算政治账。同一笔账，用两种不同方法去算，就能得出两种截然不同的结果，前者是促进，后者是促退。
    今年，“鞍平一号”重轨的大量投入生产，是我厂的一件大喜事。可是，从成本管理角度来看，我们又产生了顾虑。因为生产这种重轨，在整个生产过程中，带来了一系列的困难。由于钢质硬，使得产量低，而且在燃料、材料、工具和动力等物资消耗上也都要相应增加，我们作了一个详细计算，今年生产这种重轨，将要超支成本三十八万元。
    不算便罢，算了真叫人害怕。怕什么？怕的是指标完不成，丢了“满堂红”（指标全面完成）。如何对待？矛盾重重，于是，我们就向毛主席著作请教。毛主席告诉我们：“在生产运动中，不注重发展经济，只片面地在开支问题上打算盘的保守的单纯的财政观点，是错误的。”
    毛主席的话打动了我的心，我重新算了一笔账：由于“鞍平一号”重轨的性能好，耐磨耐用，使用寿命至少延长百分之五十。按此计算：第一，节约建设铁路的投资上千万元；第二，增加生产能力百分之十二；第三，节约不少原材料；第四，节省了铁道更换费用和修理费用。把以上四笔账加在一起，是一笔可观的大账。可见我厂生产成本增加三十八万元，所换取的经济价值，不是一个，几十个，而是上百个三十八万元。
    不算不知道，一算思想就提高了。从“鞍平一号”重轨的核算工作中，我认识到，我们一定要为六亿人民做会计。这是在增产节约运动中做好会计工作的根本前提。会计，是记账、算账、报账、管账的。把账记清了，算对了，报准了，管好了，可谓好会计了。但怎样才能做到这一点呢？仅仅有计算技术还不够，首先头脑里要有政治，只有以政治来统帅业务，才能做到记得清，算得对，报得准，管得好。我们是操办无产阶级事业的会计，那就必须以毛泽东思想武装头脑，必须突出政治，彻底肃清资本主义的经营思想影响，根除形而上学的单纯业务观点。
    实行经济核算，讲究经济效果，是社会主义企业管理的基本原则。但是，能否正确处理小局和大局的关系，又是多快好省地贯彻社会主义建设总路线不可忽视的一环。为了强调企业经济指标的完成，而影响全局经济指标的完成，是不对的。一个企业经济指标完成的好，往往不能完全体现在全国经济价值之中。而全国核算的经济成果，却包括了企业的核算成果。以“鞍平一号”重轨成本超支来说，在企业看来是不合算的，然而从国家建设看，却是大有利益。这就要求我们做财务会计工作的人员，要身在工厂，算到全国。否则，就会只在局部小圈子里算账，往往被认为是赚钱的账，而实际却是赔钱的账，使国家经济建设受到损害。
