    I. Learning from the Hero

    The Military Commission's Enlarged Meeting in 1960 issued the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army," which formulated a ten-thousand-year plan for the revolutionary and modern construction of our People's Liberation Army. This is: read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. This is also to always give prominence to politics and further arm the People's Liberation Army with the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. The troops, in accordance with the Military Commission's resolution, are striding forward and leaping forward on a very proletarianized and combat-ready road. It was at this great moment that I was transferred from the actor team of the Soldiers' Drama Troupe to the writing team. In accordance with the requirements of the Military Commission's "Resolution," "the army's literary and artistic work... must be closely integrated with the tasks and ideological situation of the troops to serve the promotion of proletarian ideology and the elimination of bourgeois ideology and the consolidation and enhancement of combat effectiveness." The leadership assigned me to the company for training. I served as a soldier and squatted in the company, studied the "Resolution" with the soldiers, and successively participated in the "Two Recalls and Three Checks" movement, the creation of the Four Goods Company movement, war preparedness and training, construction, production, and so on. I tried to write some of my experiences into a few small things, but most of them failed. This was the inevitable result of my own unsound ideology and life. However, because I did not have sufficient understanding of this, I instead believed that it was difficult to reflect and write about the reality of life in the army. I was very distressed ideologically.

    During the literary and artistic rectification study for creative personnel, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" with my comrades. In his speech, Chairman Mao instructed us: "They must for a long period unreservedly and whole-heartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, go into the heat of the struggle, go to the only, the broadest and the richest source.” I had studied Chairman Mao's teaching more than once, and I thought that I had followed Chairman Mao's instructions to go deep into life for several years, so why couldn't I still write anything? After careful examination, I realized that I had not studied Chairman Mao's "Talks" with class feelings, and I had not worked hard on the word "use," so my understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching was not deep. When I went to live in the lower levels, I only took a superficial look at things, often only seeing some superficial phenomena in life, with insufficient "observation and experience" and even less "analysis and research." This made me realize that if I wanted to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "undergo a change and a remoulding in one's thinking and feeling. Without such a change, without such a remoulding, one can accomplish nothing and one will be ill-adapted to anything."

    Immediately afterwards, I returned to a company that I was relatively familiar with. Although I was still doing exercises and attending classes with them, my feelings this time were very different. Three years ago, I met a deputy squad leader here. I remember that he was always smiling. When new recruits came to the squad, he was the first to welcome the new comrades into the door and teach them how to pack their bags and tie their shoelaces. This time, I saw him asking one of the new soldiers from that time for instructions on work. It turned out that the new soldier had already become a platoon leader. And him? He was still a deputy squad leader, still smiling and teaching another group of new comrades how to pack their bags and tie their shoelaces. Afterwards, I asked him what he thought, and he simply answered six words: "Serve the people!"

    Also in this company, I met a new comrade. He was a cook who always silently carried water barefoot. He was a young Miao man from the top of a high mountain and had no education. When he received a letter from home, he asked someone else to read it; when he had to write a reply, he also had to ask someone else to write it for him. One day, he received a letter from home asking him not to be a cook and to learn more skills. As soon as the squad leader finished reading the letter, he became angry, silently lay on the edge of the bed, and spent an hour writing his first letter, which had only seven words: "This is to serve the people!"

    "Serve the people!" and "This is to serve the people!" gave me a great shock. Since the army began studying Chairman Mao's works, such a group of soldiers has emerged: their educational level before joining the army was not high, and they could not explain many principles. After coming to the revolutionary army, the first book they read was "Serve the People." However, they can use what they learn from each sentence. They do what Chairman Mao says, wholeheartedly, truly achieving no selfishness. This is a group of new people who emerged in the 1960s, new people who have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought since they just understood the principles.

    At this time, I seemed to have realized something, and I seemed to understand our soldiers better. I began to understand that without studying Chairman Mao's works well, without thoroughly transforming one's world outlook, and without striving to narrow the ideological gap between oneself and these soldiers, it would be impossible to understand the new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, let alone how to reflect them. At that time, my strongest desire was no longer to rush to consider what to write, but to first honestly squat down and study "Serve the People" with them. Since then, during my life in the company, in addition to striving to achieve "eating, living, and exercising together," I paid special attention to "studying together." Through study, I deeply felt that I could learn many valuable things from these ordinary and great soldiers, and it was something I could never finish learning in my lifetime.

    In the winter of that year, just as I was participating in field training in the army, the heroic deeds of Ouyang Hai sacrificing himself to save the train appeared. According to the instructions of Tao Zhu, Huang Yongsheng, Liu Xingyuan and other leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region, I immediately transferred to that unit to live. In a short period of time, Ouyang Hai's comrades-in-arms introduced me to hundreds of his vivid deeds. Not to mention his heroic actions of rescuing the train and saving people from fire and water at the critical moment, even some ordinary small things in his daily work and life made me very excited.

    One rainy afternoon, I visited a culvert that Ouyang Hai had built during his lifetime on a simple road. This was a very small culvert, and passers-by would hardly notice it without the guidance of comrades. At the entrance of the cave, when I saw the three large characters "干革命" (Gàn Gémìng - Do Revolution) carved by Ouyang Hai himself, my thoughts surged, and I could not calm down for a long time. Although this was just a small culvert on a simple road in a remote mountainous area, not the Yangtze River Bridge, Ouyang Hai regarded it as an inseparable part of the magnificent socialist construction. He carefully shaped it and diligently served socialist construction and the people through this small culvert; he sincerely expressed the deep and lofty feelings of a communist fighter towards the revolutionary cause through the three common characters "干革命" (Gàn Gémìng - Do Revolution).

    In 1962, due to work needs, Ouyang Hai was changed from deputy platoon leader to squad leader. Some comrades said that he had been "demoted." Ouyang Hai laughed and said, "What's 'promotion' or 'demotion' in serving the people!"

    "干革命" (Gàn Gémìng - Do Revolution), "为人民服务" (Wèi rénmín fúwù - Serve the people), how familiar these words are! Each word has a weight of a thousand pounds, representing the most superficial and deepest revolutionary truth. Ouyang Hai's words reminded me of the deputy squad leader who warmly received new comrades-in-arms every year, the Miao soldier who diligently carried water every day, and many cadres and soldiers who worked hard to serve the people. They all became active in my mind. Although I had never seen Ouyang Hai, through the tall images of many ordinary soldiers of the same era, I seemed to see Ouyang Hai's voice and smile, and the vivid image of the hero. In front of this great communist fighter, I first felt that the ideological gap between myself and him was very large, and I must learn from Ouyang Hai well, take Comrade Ouyang Hai as an example, re-study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and seriously transform the fundamental issue of world outlook.

    After a period of study and repeated research on Ouyang Hai's materials, gradually, I found that some changes had taken place in myself, and I was closer to Ouyang Hai in terms of ideological feelings, thus generating a strong desire to express Ouyang Hai's glorious life through literary and artistic works.

    II. Understanding the Hero

    Having a strong desire to express the heroic character of Ouyang Hai is not the same as truly understanding Ouyang Hai. Learning from the hero and understanding the hero also went through several repetitions and gradually deepened. At the beginning, the idea of the theme of the novel was relatively simple, just wanting to write about Ouyang Hai wanting to be a hero, but not being a hero; later, he knew what it meant to be a hero, and as a result, he became a hero but didn't know it. At this time, the leadership pointed out that "writing heroes is to write about our great Party and our era. We must write about the changes in the troops over the past few years through Ouyang Hai's growth." How to digest and implement the leadership's instructions? Premier Zhou's inscription for Comrade Lei Feng gave me great inspiration. Premier Zhou called on us to learn from Comrade Lei Feng: "A clear-cut class stand of love and hate, a revolutionary spirit of consistency between words and deeds, a communist style of selflessness, and a proletarian fighting will of selfless courage." Aren't these four sentences the highest summary of Comrade Ouyang Hai's great life? Then I reviewed the speech by Political Commissar Tao Zhu at the naming ceremony of "Ouyang Hai Class": "Comrade Ouyang Hai's ability to sacrifice himself in this way is by no means accidental. It is impossible without the Party's training. Our social system will continue to produce such figures as Ouyang Hai!" The leader's instructions deepened my understanding of Ouyang Hai.

    In the process of collecting materials, the first thing I came into contact with was Ouyang Hai's strong class hatred for the old society and his incomparable love for the new society. Ouyang Hai's hometown, the mountainous area of ​​Guiyang County, was very poor before liberation. Ouyang Hai's birth brought not joy to the whole family, but the threat of "one out of two for conscription". At the age of seven, he begged for food in the snow, and at a young age, he carried charcoal and sold it on the street. Cruel class oppression cultivated his character of daring to struggle and uncompromising. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated him from the abyss of suffering, and he had deep class feelings for the new society, the Party, and the people. In the countryside, he was an active member of the cooperative road. In the army, he patiently helped every class comrade with class feelings. In 1962, when a dark wind swept through the countryside and the socialist road and the capitalist road clashed fiercely, Ouyang Hai went home to visit his family and met his brother whom he had been separated from for many years. However, the first words he said when they met were "You have forgotten your roots!" In Ouyang Hai's mind, flesh and blood relatives have never been as close as class relatives! "A clear-cut class stand of love and hate" is Ouyang Hai's most distinctive character feature. Therefore, this requires that in the work, Ouyang Hai must first be written as an incarnation of the class, writing out his simple and firm proletarian stand, his clear class feelings of love and hate, and writing about his growth in the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the socialist era. This can truly reflect the essence of Ouyang Hai.

    Ouyang Hai is not a hero of the war years, but a hero who grew up in the vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction period. Heroes and heroic acts are not an abstract concept, they are all marked with the clear imprints of the era and class; the height of a hero's image does not lie in whether he is "twelve feet tall and can lift a thousand pounds," but because all his words and actions are closely related to the major domestic and international events of the time. Heroic figures all answer the questions raised by the times in different positions through their own glorious actions. Lei Feng is like this, Ouyang Hai is like this, and the people of Daqing and Dazhai are also like this. This also prompted me to consciously place Ouyang Hai's growth in a clear historical background to depict it. For example, after the Military Commission's Enlarged Meeting, the troops launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion in 1959, the withdrawal of Soviet modern revisionist experts in 1960, the Two Recalls and Three Checks movement in 1961, the emergency war preparedness on the southeast coast in 1962, and so on, so that the work reflects the major events of these years. Depicting the hero in the background of such a complex and acute class struggle makes it possible for the artistic image of Ouyang Hai to be not only an incarnation of the class, but also an incarnation of the spirit of the socialist era, and it is also possible to centrally express the characteristics of heroic figures of the socialist era in him.

    As an incarnation of the class and the spirit of the era, where does the power of Ouyang Hai's "revolutionary spirit of consistency between words and deeds" come from? Since the end of 1960, when the troops launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the troops have directly drawn spiritual power from Chairman Mao's works, which has greatly accelerated the pace of revolutionization. Ouyang Hai's education level was low, and he didn't recognize many characters when studying Chairman Mao's works, but he held a "Xinhua Dictionary" and studied while recognizing characters, often studying hard alone until eleven or twelve o'clock in the night, showing amazing tenacity and perseverance in his study. He studied Chairman Mao's works with ardent class feelings, doing it while learning and implementing it throughout. Even when he sacrificed himself, his satchel still contained Chairman Mao's works, which carried his body temperature. Striving to study Chairman Mao's works is the source of strength for any revolutionary of our time to continuously progress. To write a good hero, we must write about how Ouyang Hai studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Ouyang Hai, who lived in the socialist era, was very fortunate to directly draw spiritual power from Chairman Mao's works and directly use Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful spiritual weapon, to transform himself and transform society, making himself a very conscious proletarian fighter with a very clear goal. It is precisely under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought that Ouyang Hai became a communist fighter who "is in the company, but has the world in his heart," always cares about the fate of the two-thirds of the oppressed and exploited class brothers in the world, and serves the people of all China and the people of the world with a red heart. This is also the most important characteristic that distinguishes Ouyang Hai from the heroic figures of the past war years.

    Ouyang Hai should be written as an incarnation of the class; the novel should embody a strong spirit of the times; the power of Mao Zedong Thought should be fully written through Ouyang Hai's growth. These three aspects were not very clear at the beginning, but were gradually understood after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works and studying the resolution of the Military Commission's Enlarged Meeting and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on literary and artistic work in the army. In this way, a red ideological line of the work was sorted out, and the basic understanding of the heroic character of Ouyang Hai was completed, forming the conception of the work. This is also a process of further improving one's political level and ideological awareness.

    III. Expressing the Hero

    (1) The Problem of Real People and Real Events and Artistic Processing

    Ouyang Hai himself in real life is a radiant communist hero. Comrades told me more than a hundred of his stories, and only more than sixty were selected in the novel. The arrangement of the events roughly maintains the original order, and some adjustments have been made to a small part. At present, except for the section "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals," in which writing about him being rescued from the fire pit is fictional, the others are based on real life. The hero's deeds are so moving that there is no need to create anything fictional.

    Most of the things written in the novel are ordinary small things in life, such as picking a tea seed, buying a book, delivering a bowl of rice, and so on. I tried to embody the class feelings of the heroic character and embody Mao Zedong Thought through these small things. I believe that through these "small things," we can show the spirit of our socialist era. Thousands of good comrades are doing this great and ordinary work, working hard in their respective positions and being a never-rusting screw. Although they have not made any "great achievements," our socialist cause very much needs such comrades. Therefore, the key to whether Ouyang Hai should be artistically fictionalized lies in whether the great significance of these "small things" can be deeply explored. The hero's own behavior has fully embodied the great communist ideological qualities. Therefore, the task before me is not to re-create any plot, but to strive to dig deeper on the basis of the existing moving deeds, in order to maintain the hero's original appearance.

    As for some of the characters around Ouyang Hai, due to the needs of creation, more fiction and artistic processing have been done, and no real names have been used. Many of the other characters who appear in the novel are Ouyang Hai's comrades-in-arms in life, and more are the characters I have accumulated during my years of going deep into life. At the same time, I have also used a large number of my life stock from the past few years, and almost all the feelings I have gained in the army have been written into it. This once again proves the truth that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: life is the only source of artistic creation. If I had not participated in the army's heated struggle life for a long time in the previous period, there would be no possibility of carrying out fiction and artistic processing today.

    (2) How to Write the Growth of Heroic Characters

    In the process of creation, I restudied Chairman Mao's discussion on class and class struggle, and my thinking has improved. I feel that we should look at today's reality from the perspective of class struggle. The socialist revolution is to revolutionize the bourgeoisie and the individualism. To write heroic characters, we must write about how they participated in the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, writing about how they participated in the social struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, transforming the objective world; and also writing about how they carried out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in their own minds, transforming the subjective world. It is unimaginable to write about heroes in peacetime without separating them from the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. Heroic figures are also growing in the process of constantly studying Chairman Mao's works and constantly transforming themselves. Therefore, in the first half of the novel, I wrote about Ouyang Hai's desire to be strong and competitive, wanting to be a hero and wanting to stand out. Some people say that it is not good to write about this. I feel that if I don't write about it, I can't show the power of the Party, show how this good piece of iron overcame some of its weaknesses and became pure steel in the revolutionary furnace, and I can't show the superiority of our socialist system. Because it is precisely under the socialist system that the revolutionization of people is carried out on a large scale, which has brought about tremendous changes in the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people, and Ouyang Hai is no exception. Writing heroes is not the purpose, writing heroes is to better sing the praises of our great era and our great Party, so in the first half of the novel, I insisted on writing about Ouyang Hai's growth.

    However, due to Ouyang Hai's poor peasant family background and his simple class consciousness since he was a child, writing about his growth and the shortcomings in his growth must also be done with caution and appropriately. At the beginning, I didn't grasp it well enough, and I wrote about his desire to be strong and competitive too much, with a strong color of individual heroism, which deviated from the class essence of the character. This was an excessive pursuit of the clarity of the contrast between the character's growth before and after, while ignoring the authenticity of life. It was only after the leadership pointed it out that I corrected it.

    (3) How to Write the Ideological Height of Heroic Characters, that is, How to Shape the New Heroes of the Socialist Era

    This question is actually a continuation of the previous question. Initially, when the novel was written to the fifth chapter, Ouyang Hai had already joined the Party, understood what a true hero was, and established the world outlook of serving the people. It should be said that as a people's soldier, he had already matured. It seemed possible to write about rescuing the train in the tenth chapter next. But today's era is the socialist era, and today's heroes are heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It is far from enough to just write about his personal growth. We must write about the great power of Mao Zedong Thought in him. For this reason, I rewrote "Bone Hard Heart Red," using Ouyang Hai to describe the struggle of self-reliance and anti-revisionism; arranged "Locomotive" to write about how he studied and applied Chairman Mao's works to drive backward soldiers; "Hometown Trip" to write about his participation in the domestic two-road struggle; and chapters eight and nine, where he correctly handled a struggle of new and old ideas within the army. I tried to test him and fully demonstrate the ideological height of a communist fighter by placing the hero in the major international and domestic struggles and the struggle of new and old ideas.

    Due to my own low ideological level and poor understanding of Chairman Mao's works, I also took many detours in writing these chapters. In order to highlight Ouyang Hai's image in the face of severe and difficult tests, I did not write the surrounding characters and objective environment accurately enough. For example, in the fifth chapter, the arrogance of revisionism was written as too rampant; the problems of the backward soldiers in the sixth chapter, the eldest brother in "Hometown Trip," and Xue Xinwen in chapters eight and nine were also written as too serious. In this way, although Ouyang Hai was highlighted, the above-mentioned supporting characters were excessively belittled, and the description of the objective environment was also somewhat untrue. At that time, there were more opinions heard in this regard, and I couldn't grasp how to reflect the anti-revisionist struggle and handle this series of contradictions among the people. When I reported these problems to the leaders of the Political Department and the Cultural Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, the leaders gave me great support. On the one hand, they encouraged me to write boldly, as long as the direction was right and there was a real-life basis, not to be afraid of making mistakes, and the leadership would bear the responsibility if problems occurred; on the other hand, they instructed me to repeatedly study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Nine Commentaries" and other articles, striving for appropriate measures. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's works and with the continuous help of leaders and comrades, these difficulties were gradually overcome. However, such as the relationship between Ouyang Hai and Xue Xinwen in chapters eight and nine, although it has been revised several times, it has not yet been resolved to my own satisfaction. From here, I deeply realized that whether or not the ideological height of the hero can be written depends fundamentally on whether one's own thinking can be solid, that is, whether one can study and apply Chairman Mao's works to solve the problem of one's own world outlook.

    (4) On the Question of Improving Skills

    I am a new recruit in the drama creation team. I have never written or even thought of writing a novel. The issue of skills is another difficulty in front of me. In the first draft of the novel, there was too much dialogue. People who read it said that the drama was not like a drama and the movie was not like a movie, and I was also very distressed. In the process of creation, I deeply realized that a clear theme and rich material are certainly the soul and foundation of creation, but if we do not pay attention to artistry, the language is dry and monotonous, the structure is flat and straightforward, and there is no artistic appeal, it cannot "serve as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and eliminate the enemy."

    Learning skills still means learning from life and learning from the masses, repeatedly carrying out the process of writing practice, which is also the process of exercising and improving skills. Some of the plot arrangements in this work, as well as many of the languages, are all derived from life and from the masses. After writing it, I would take it to the masses for appraisal. Which chapters they liked to hear, which ones they didn't like to hear, which characters and languages they said were like, and which ones they said were not like, I wrote them down one by one. After revision and processing, I would read it to them again. Only after it was approved could the work be considered "passed." Secondly, I sought advice from professional comrades around me, who helped and guided me with great enthusiasm. The comrades in the creation team of our drama troupe, the comrades in the creation team of the Cultural Department, the comrades of the "Liberation Army Literature and Art" and "Harvest" magazine, etc., all gave detailed guidance on the structure and language of the work. Some comrades even helped me repeatedly deliberate on individual words and sentences. In order to seize the time to make up for the basic skills, I read and analyzed some works, especially trying to find biographical literature and novels that describe heroic characters to study. Such as "The Story of Dong Cunrui," "The Biography of Liu Hulan," "Huang Jiguang," "Yang Gensi" and other works, studying how these works express the thoughts and feelings of heroic characters, and how they write about the growth process of heroic characters. I learned and absorbed a lot of useful things from these works. Of course, I learned very poorly and was in a state of "sharpening my gun before the battle." Therefore, there are still many immature aspects in the skills of the novel, especially the use of the vivid and figurative language of soldiers and the masses is very insufficient, which is something I need to work hard to solve in the future.

    (5) The Question of Verification and Improvement

    Since the novel is processed on the basis of real people and real events, it is very necessary to verify the materials. At that time, I thought that verification was only to check whether there were any discrepancies in the main events described in the book. I didn't know that in the process of verification, I lived again and found countless collaborators for creating this novel. I took the first draft of the novel to verify, from the political commissar of the army to the comrades-in-arms of Ouyang Hai in the same class, from the county party committee and commune cadres to the masses and relatives in Ouyang Hai's hometown. I read it to them from beginning to end. These people either lived with Ouyang Hai day and night, or watched Ouyang Hai grow up. They were the most familiar with and understood Ouyang Hai the most. They were my best teachers and also the strictest reviewers. Because there was a first draft, it aroused many associations in them and awakened many memories in them. The soldiers introduced Ouyang Hai's words, smiles, and personality characteristics to me; the leading cadres described Ouyang Hai's growth process to me and also talked about how the spirit of the troops in this period should be reflected. The masses in Ouyang Hai's hometown introduced to me the great changes in the living conditions in Guiyang County after liberation, many stories of Ouyang Hai before he joined the army, and the face of class struggle in the countryside, and so on. These greatly enriched and supplemented my life and played an important role in improving the ideological and artistic nature of the novel. I conducted a total of three such level-by-level verifications. Every time I finished revising, I would go once; every time I went down, it was exactly the process of re-immersing myself in life and deepening my understanding of the hero. The novel was revised three times before and after, and it was also fully verified three times. This was a relatively arduous task for me. If I had not studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and understood the truth that "practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge, this form moves in cycles without end, and with each cycle the content of practice and knowledge rises to a higher level," I would not have been able to do this so-called "verification" work well. After several verifications, all those who knew Ouyang Hai believed that there were no major discrepancies in the events and that the spiritual outlook of Ouyang Hai was basically written. This was also a great encouragement to me. In short, I think this approach is a very good way for creative personnel to combine with the masses and follow the mass line in creation.

                          ＊　＊　＊

    The above is a rough process of my learning to write "Ouyang Hai's Song." Since the publication of "Ouyang Hai's Song," it has received enthusiastic encouragement from many comrades. I deeply feel that the emergence of this book is the product of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, the product of the socialist system, the product of the great revolutionary qualities of Martyr Ouyang Hai, and that all this has nurtured the birth of this work. The creative process of this work was also written under the care and guidance of the General Political Department, the Guangzhou Military Region Party Committee and the Political Department, with the enthusiastic support of the vast number of officers and soldiers of the unit where Ouyang Hai served and the masses in Ouyang Hai's hometown, under the specific guidance of the "Harvest" Editorial Department and the "Liberation Army Literature and Art" Society, and with the enthusiastic help of Comrades Ai Pu and Liao Yongming. It is the product of the "three combinations." It is also because I have not learned enough from the hero, especially because I have not understood the hero deeply enough, that I have failed to accurately and vividly reflect the hero's spiritual outlook and noble ideological qualities. I am only just learning to walk in understanding the hero, learning from the hero, and reflecting the hero. In the future, I must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works, work hard to go deep into the heated struggle, work hard to improve my performance skills, take the hero as an example, work diligently, constantly move forward, and always be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought.

    一九六○年军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，为我人民解放军的革命化现代化建设，制定了一套万年大计。这就是：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。这也就是永远突出政治，进一步用当代马克思列宁主义发展的顶峰——毛泽东思想来武装人民解放军。部队遵照军委的决议，在非常无产阶级化、战斗化的道路上，迈开大步，向前飞跃。正是在这个大好时机，我从战士话剧团演员队调到创作组。按照军委“决议”的要求，“部队的文艺工作……必须密切结合部队的任务和思想情况，为兴无灭资、巩固和提高战斗力服务。”领导上让我到连队进行锻炼。我在连队当兵、蹲点，和战士们一起学“决议”，先后参加了“两忆三查”运动，创造四好连队运动，备战和训练，施工、生产等等。我曾试着把自己的一些体会写成几个小东西，但大都失败了。这本来是自己思想不过硬，生活不过硬的必然结果。但是，由于自己对此认识不足，反而认为部队现实生活不好反映、难写。思想上很苦恼。
    在创作人员文艺整风学习中，我和同志们一起反复地学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席在讲话中指示我们：“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去”。毛主席的这一教导，我学过不止一次了，几年来自认为是遵循了毛主席指示去深入生活的，为什么仍然写不出东西来？认真一检查，原来自己没有带着阶级感情学习毛主席的“讲话”，没有在“用”字上狠下功夫，所以对毛主席的这一教导领会不深。下去生活走马观花，往往只看到生活中的一些表面现象，“观察、体验”不深，“分析、研究”更不够。这使我领悟到，要想做一个毛泽东思想的宣传员，就必须按照毛主席的教导，“把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”
    紧接着我回到一个比较熟悉的连队，尽管是同样和他们一起出操上课，但这一次的感受却大不相同。三年前在这里结识了一位副班长，记得他总是笑呵呵的，班里来了新兵，他第一个把新战友迎进门来，教他们如何打背包，如何系鞋带。这次去，看见他正在向当年的一个新战士请示工作。原来那个新战士已经担任排长了。他呢？还是当副班长，还是笑呵呵地在教另一批新战友如何打背包，如何系鞋带。事后我问他是怎么想的，他简简单单地回答了六个字：“为人民服务嘛！”
    同是在这个连队，我又认识了一个新同志。他是个炊事员，总是闷声不响地光着脚丫子挑水。他是一位家在高山顶上的苗族青年，没有文化。收到家信了，他求别人念；要回信时，也得请别人代写。有一天，家里来信要他别干炊事员了，多学点技术。班长刚把这信念完，他就火了，闷声不响地趴在床沿上，就着小油灯，花了一个来钟头写出他平生的第一封信，信上只有七个字：“这是为人民服务！”
      “为人民服务嘛！”和“这是为人民服务！”给了我很大的震动。部队大学毛主席著作以来，涌现出这样一批战士：他们参军前的文化水平不高，能讲出的道理也很少，来到革命部队后读完的第一本书，就是《为人民服务》。但是，他们学一句，就能用一句，毛主席怎样说，他们就怎样做，全心全意的做，真正做到了毫无自私自利之心。这是六十年代出现的一批新人，从刚刚懂道理起就用毛泽东思想武装起来的新人。
    这时，我好象领悟到一点什么东西了，也似乎比较理解我们的战士了。我开始懂得了：不学好毛主席著作，不彻底改造自己的世界观，不努力缩小自己和这些战士思想上的差距，就根本无法理解用毛泽东思想武装起来的新人，更谈不上如何去反映他们。当时我最强烈的愿望不再是急着考虑写什么，而是首先老老实实地蹲下来，跟他们一起学习《为人民服务》。从此，我在连队生活期间，除努力做到“同吃、同住、同操课”外，特别注意了“同学习”。通过学习，我深感到从这些平凡而伟大的战士的身上，我能学到很多宝贵的东西，而且是一辈子也学不完的。
    就在这一年的冬天，正当我在部队参加野营合练的时候，欧阳海舍身救列车的英雄事迹出现了。根据广州部队陶铸、黄永胜、刘兴元等首长的指示，我立即转到该部队去生活。在短短的时间内，欧阳海生前的战友向我介绍了他的数以百计的生动的事迹。且不谈他在千钧一发的时刻抢救列车和上房救火、下水救人的英雄行为，就以他在日常工作、生活中的一些平凡的小事来说，也使我激动不已。
    一个阴雨天的下午，我在一条简便公路上，参观了欧阳海生前所修的一个涵洞。这是一个很小很小的涵洞，不经同志们指点，过路的行人很难注意到它。在洞口，当我看到欧阳海亲手刻写的“干革命”这三个大字时，思潮翻腾起伏，心情久久不能平静。尽管这只是偏僻山区简便公路上的小涵洞，不是长江大桥，可是欧阳海把它看成是宏伟的社会主义建设不可分割的组成部分。他细心地塑造它，勤勤恳恳地通过这小小的涵洞来为社会主义建设服务，为人民服务；他真心诚意地通过“干革命”这三个常见的字，抒发出了一个共产主义战士对待革命事业深厚而崇高的感情。
    一九六二年，因工作需要，欧阳海由副排长改任班长。有的同志说把他给“降”了。欧阳海听了哈哈大笑：“为人民服务，有啥‘升’啊‘降’的！”
    “干革命”“为人民服务”，多么熟悉的话呵！这每个字都有千斤分量，代表着最浅、也是最深的革命道理。欧阳海的话，使我想起了那个年年热情接待新战友的副班长，想起了那个每天勤勤恳恳挑水的苗族战士，还想起了许多辛勤为人民服务的干部和战士们，他们都在我的脑海中活动起来。我虽然没有看见过欧阳海，但通过同时代很多普通战士的高大形象，我仿佛也看到了欧阳海的音容笑貌，看到了栩栩如生的英雄形象。在这个伟大的共产主义战士面前，我首先感到的是自己和他的思想差距很大，必须很好地向欧阳海学习，以欧阳海同志为榜样，重新学习“老三篇”，把世界观这一根本问题来一番认真改造。
    经过一个阶段的学习和对欧阳海材料的反复研究，逐渐地，我发现自己起了一些变化，在思想感情上和欧阳海靠近了一些，从而产生了通过文艺作品来表现欧阳海光辉的一生的强烈愿望。
    二、理解英雄
    有了强烈的表现欧阳海这一英雄人物的愿望，还不等于已经真正理解了欧阳海。学习英雄，理解英雄，也是经过若干次反复，逐步加深的。开始时，对小说的主题思想的设想比较简单，只是想写欧阳海想当英雄，而不是英雄；后来他知道了怎么才算是英雄，结果成了英雄反而不知道。这时，领导上指出“写英雄，是为了写我们伟大的党，写我们的时代。要通过欧阳海的成长写出部队几年来的变化。”怎样消化和落实领导上的这一指示呢？周总理给雷锋同志的题词给了我很大的启发。周总理号召我们要学习雷锋同志：“憎爱分明的阶级立场，言行一致的革命精神，公而忘私的共产主义风格，奋不顾身的无产阶级斗志”。这四句话不也正是对欧阳海同志伟大一生的最高的概括吗？接着我又重温了陶铸政委在“欧阳海班”命名大会上的讲话：“欧阳海同志能够这样牺牲自己，决不是偶然的，没有党的培养，是不可能的。我们的这个社会制度，会不断出现欧阳海这样的人物！”首长的指示，使我加深了对欧阳海的理解。
    在收集材料的过程中，我首先接触到的，是欧阳海对旧社会强烈的阶级仇恨，对新社会的无比热爱。欧阳海的家乡——桂阳县山区，解放前十分贫困。欧阳海一生下来，给全家带来的不是喜悦，而是“两丁抽一”的威胁。他七岁就冒雪讨饭，小小年纪就担炭沿街叫卖。残酷的阶级压迫，养成了他敢于斗争、毫不妥协的性格。共产党毛主席把他从水深火热中解放了出来，他对新社会，对党和人民有着深厚的阶级感情。在农村中，他是走合作化道路的积极分子。在部队中，他带着阶级感情耐心地帮助每一个阶级战友。一九六二年，当农村刮起一股黑风，社会主义道路和资本主义道路激烈交锋的时候，欧阳海回去探家，会到了分别多年的哥哥。但是，他见面的第一句话就是“你忘了本！”在欧阳海的心目中，从来都是骨肉亲不如阶级亲呵！“憎爱分明的阶级立场”，正是欧阳海最鲜明的性格特色。因此，这就要求在作品中，必须首先把欧阳海作为一个阶级的化身来写，写出他朴素而坚定的无产阶级立场，爱憎分明的阶级感情，写他在社会主义时代兴无灭资斗争中成长，这才能如实地反映出欧阳海的本质来。
    欧阳海不是战争时期的英雄，是在轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期成长起来的英雄。英雄和英雄行为，不是一个抽象的概念，它无不打上鲜明的时代和阶级的烙印；英雄形象的高大，不在于他是否“身长丈二，力举千斤”，而是由于他的一切言语行动，都是和当时重大的国内、国际事件息息相关的，英雄人物都是在不同岗位上，用自己光辉的行为回答了时代提出的问题。雷锋是这样，欧阳海是这样，大庆、大寨人也是这样。这也就促使我有意识地把欧阳海的成长放在鲜明的时代背景上来描绘。譬如军委扩大会议以后部队掀起大学毛主席著作的高潮，一九五八年的大跃进，一九五九年平定西藏叛匪，一九六○年苏联现代修正主义撤退专家，一九六一年两忆三查运动，一九六二年东南沿海紧急备战等等，使作品对这几年中的重大事件都有所反映。把英雄放在这样复杂而尖锐的阶级斗争的背景上来描画，这就有可能使得欧阳海这一艺术形象，不仅是阶级的化身，而且是社会主义时代精神的化身，也就有可能在他身上集中表现出社会主义时代英雄人物的特色来。
    作为阶级的化身，时代精神的化身，欧阳海“言行一致的革命精神”的力量是从何而来的？自一九六○年底部队掀起活学活用毛主席著作高潮以来，部队广大官兵直接从毛主席著作中吸取精神力量，大大加速了革命化的步伐。欧阳海文化低，学习毛主席著作时有不少字不认识，但他捧着一本《新华字典》，一边认字，一边学习，常常一个人苦学到深夜十一二点，在学习中表现了惊人的顽强和毅力。他带着炽热的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，做到了边学边用，贯彻始终。就在他牺牲时，他的挎包里还珍藏着带着他体温的毛主席著作。努力学习毛主席著作，是我们同时代任何一个革命者能够不断进步的力量源泉。要写好英雄，就必须写好欧阳海是如何活学活用毛主席著作的。生活在社会主义时代的欧阳海，十分幸福地直接从毛主席著作中吸取了精神力量，直接用毛泽东思想这一强大的精神武器来改造自己，改造社会，使自己成为一个十分自觉的、目标十分明确的无产阶级战士。正是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，欧阳海才成为一个“身在连队，胸怀世界”，时刻关心着世界上三分之二受压迫受剥削的阶级兄弟的命运，一颗红心为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的共产主义战士。这也正是欧阳海不同于过去战争年代英雄人物的一个最主要的特色。
    应当把欧阳海写成阶级的化身；应当在小说中体现强烈的时代精神；通过欧阳海的成长充分写出毛泽东思想的威力。这三个方面，开始并不十分明确，经过反复学习毛主席著作，学习军委扩大会议决议和林副主席对部队文艺工作的指示，才逐渐领会的。这样，理出了作品的一条思想的红线，也就完成了对欧阳海这一英雄人物的基本理解，形成了作品的构思。这也同时是自己政治水平和思想觉悟进一步提高的过程。
    三、表现英雄
    （一）真人真事与艺术加工的问题
    生活中的欧阳海本人，就是一个光芒四射的共产主义英雄人物。同志们向我讲述了他的一百多个故事，小说中只选用了六十多个。事迹的安排大致保持了原来的顺序，小部分做了一些调整。目前小说中除了《天兵天将》一节写他被救出火坑是虚构的以外，其他都是有真实生活的依据的。英雄的事迹如此动人，事实上也不需要再搞什么虚构的东西了。
    小说中写的大多都是一些平凡的生活小事，如拣一粒茶籽，买一本书，送一碗饭，等等。我试图通过这些小事来体现英雄人物的阶级感情和体现毛泽东思想。我认为透过这些“小事”，可以显示出我们社会主义的时代风尚。千千万万个好同志，正是在从事这种伟大而平凡的工作，在各自的岗位上埋头苦干，当一个永不生锈的螺丝钉。尽管他们并没有立下什么“丰功伟绩”，可我们的社会主义事业却非常需要这样一些同志。因此，对于欧阳海这一人物是否要进行艺术虚构的关键，在于能否把这些“小事”的伟大意义挖深挖透。英雄本身的行为已充分体现了伟大的共产主义思想品质。所以摆在我面前的课题，不是去重新硬编什么情节，而是力求在现有的动人事迹的基础上，深挖一步，以期达到保持英雄的本来的面貌。
    至于欧阳海周围的一些人物，由于创作上的需要，作了比较多的虚构和艺术加工，也都没有用真实姓名。小说中出现的其他人物，不少是生活中欧阳海的战友，更多的是我几年来深入生活时积累的人物，同时也大量地调用了几年来的生活库存，几乎把历次在部队中得到的感受都写进去了。这又一次证明了毛主席所谆谆教导我们的真理：生活是艺术创造的唯一源泉。假如没有我前一段较长时间的参加部队火热的斗争生活，也就没有今天进行虚构和艺术加工的可能。
    （二）如何写英雄人物的成长问题
    在创作过程中，重学了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，思想上有所提高。我觉得应该用阶级斗争的观点来看今天的现实。社会主义革命是革资产阶级的命，革个人主义的命。写英雄人物就要写他是怎样参加兴无灭资的斗争的，既写他参加社会的兴无灭资的斗争，改造客观世界；也要写他在自己头脑中进行兴无灭资的斗争，改造主观世界。写和平时期的英雄，脱离开兴无灭资的斗争是不可想象的。英雄人物也正是在不断学习毛主席著作，不断改造自己的过程中成长的。因此，在小说的前半部，我写了欧阳海的争强好胜，一心想当英雄，想冒尖。有人说写了不好，我觉得如果不写，就显示不出党的力量，显示不出这一块好铁，是如何在革命熔炉的冶炼中，克服自己的某些弱点而成为纯钢的，也显示不出我们社会主义制度的优越性。因为正是在社会主义制度下，大搞人的革命化，才使我国人民的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，欧阳海并不例外。写英雄不是目的，写英雄是为了更好地歌颂我们伟大的时代，伟大的党，所以在小说的前半部坚持了写欧阳海的成长。
    但是，由于欧阳海的贫农家庭出身，由于他从小就有了朴素的阶级觉悟，写他的成长，写他成长中的若干缺点，又必须掌握分寸，写得恰当。开始时自己掌握得不够好，写他争强好胜过火了一些，带有较浓厚的个人英雄主义的色彩，这就脱离了人物的阶级本质。这是过分追求人物成长前后对比的鲜明性，而忽略了生活的真实性。在领导指出后才改正过来。
    （三）如何写出英雄人物的思想高度，也就是如何塑造社会主义时代的新英雄的问题
    这个问题实际上是前一个问题的继续。最初，小说写到第五章，欧阳海已经入了党，明白了什么是真正的英雄，确立了为人民服务的世界观，应该说作为一个人民战士，他已经成熟了，接下去写第十章抢救列车，似乎也可以。但是今天的时代，是社会主义时代，今天的英雄，是毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，仅仅写出他个人的成长，还远远不够，必须写出毛泽东思想在他身上所产生的巨大威力。为此，重写了《骨硬心红》，通过欧阳海来描写自力更生和反修的斗争；安排了《火车头》，写他如何活学活用毛主席著作，带动后进战士；《家乡行》，写他参与国内两条道路的斗争；以及八、九两章，他正确处理了一场部队内部新旧思想的斗争。试图通过把英雄放在国际国内的重大斗争中、新旧思想的斗争中来考验他，来充分展示一个共产主义战士的思想高度。
    由于自己的思想水平不高，毛主席著作学习领会得很差，写这些章节也都走过不少弯路。为了在严峻的困难考验中突出欧阳海的形象，把周围的人物和客观环境都写得不够准确，如第五章，曾把修正主义的气焰写得过分嚣张了些；第六章中的后进战士，《家乡行》的大哥，八、九两章的薛新文等人物的问题，也都写得过重，这样，虽突出了欧阳海，却过于贬低了上述陪衬人物，对客观环境的描写也有些不够真实了。当时听到的这方面的意见比较多，自己对如何反映反修斗争和处理这一系列人民内部矛盾把握不住。我把这些问题向广州部队政治部文化部领导汇报时，领导上给了我很大支持，一方面鼓励我大胆地写，只要方向对头，有真实生活依据，不要怕犯错误，出了问题由领导上承担责任；一方面指示我反复学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以及“九评”等文章，力求分寸得当。在毛主席著作的启示下，在领导和同志们的不断帮助下，这些困难逐步得到了克服。但，如八、九两章关于欧阳海和薛新文的关系问题，虽然几经修改，至今仍未得到自认为满意的解决，从这里我深深体会到，能否写出英雄思想的高度，根本问题是自己的思想能否过硬的问题，也就是能否活学活用毛主席著作来解决自己世界观的问题。
    （四）关于提高技巧的问题
    我是话剧创作队伍中的一名新兵，从未写过、也没想到过写小说，技巧问题是摆在面前的又一难关。小说的初稿，对话过多，别人看了说话剧不象话剧，电影不象电影，自己也很苦恼。在创作过程中我深深体会到：明确的主题，丰富的素材固然是创作的灵魂和基础，但是，如果不注意艺术性，语言干巴单调，结构平铺直叙，没有艺术感染力，同样不能“作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    学技巧首先还是向生活学习，向群众学习，反复进行写作实践的过程，也就是锻炼和提高技巧的过程。这部作品中的一些情节安排，以至于不少语言，都是从生活中，从群众中得来的。写出来以后再拿去由群众鉴定，哪些章节他们爱听，哪些他们不爱听，哪些人物、语言他们说象，哪些说不象，我都一一记了下来，经过修改，加工，再念给他们听，批准了，作品这也才算“过关”了。其次是求教于身旁的专业同志，他们极其热心地对我进行帮助指导。我们话剧团创作组的同志，文化部创作组的同志，《解放军文艺》社和《收获》社的同志等等，都对作品的结构、语言加以详细的指点，有的同志甚至在个别字句上帮助我反复的推敲。为了抓紧时间对基本功进行补课，我阅读和分析了一些作品，特别是尽可能地找那些描写英雄人物的传记文学和小说进行学习。如《董存瑞的故事》、《刘胡兰小传》、《黄继光》、《杨根思》等作品，学习这些作品是怎样表现英雄人物的思想感情的，是如何写英雄人物成长的过程的。从这些作品中我借鉴和吸取了很多有益的东西。当然，我学习得还很差，又处于“临阵磨枪”的状况。因此，小说在技巧上还有很多不成熟的地方，特别是运用战士和群众的生动形象的语言上很不够，这是需要我今后努力解决的问题。
    （五）核实和提高的问题
    由于小说是在真人真事的基础上加工的，因此核实材料的工作十分必要。当时我以为核实只不过是核对书中所描写的主要事迹是否有出入，殊不知在核实的过程中，我等于重新生活了一次，找到了创作这部小说的无数的合作者。我带着小说初稿下去核实，从军政治委员到欧阳海同班的战友，从县委、公社干部到欧阳海家乡的群众和亲人，我从头到尾念给他们听。这些人或者是和欧阳海朝夕相处，或者是眼看着欧阳海长大的，他们最熟悉、最了解欧阳海。他们是我最好的老师，也是最严格的审稿者。由于有了初稿，引起了他们很多联想，唤起了他们很多回忆。战士们向我介绍了欧阳海的言谈笑貌，性格特点；领导干部们向我描绘了欧阳海的成长过程，也谈了应该如何反映这一时期部队的精神面貌。欧阳海家乡的群众向我介绍了桂阳县解放后生活面貌的巨大变化，介绍了欧阳海入伍前的很多故事，以及农村阶级斗争的面貌等等。这些都大大地丰富和补充了我的生活，对小说思想性和艺术性的提高起了重要的作用。象这样的逐级核实，我一共进行了三次。每改完一遍，就要去一次；每下去一次，也正是自己重新深入生活，加深对英雄理解的过程。小说前后大改了三次，也全面地核实了三次。这对我来说是个比较艰巨的工作，要不是学习毛主席的《实践论》，明白了“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”这一真理，这一所谓“核实”工作，我是做不好的。经过几次核实，凡是了解欧阳海的人，都认为事件上没有什么大的出入，基本上写出了欧阳海的精神面貌。这对自己也是一个很大的鼓励。总之，我觉得这种做法，是创作人员和群众相结合，在创作中走群众路线的一种很好的方式。
                          ＊　＊　＊
    以上，就是我在学习写作《欧阳海之歌》中的一个粗略的过程。《欧阳海之歌》出版以来，受到了很多同志的热情鼓励，我深深地感到：这本书的出现，是光辉的毛泽东思想的产物，是社会主义制度的产物，是欧阳海烈士伟大革命品质的产物，是这一切孕育了这部作品的诞生。这部作品的创作过程，又是在总政治部、广州部队党委和政治部的关怀指导下，在欧阳海生前所在部队的广大官兵，和欧阳海家乡的群众热情支持下，在《收获》编辑部和《解放军文艺》社的具体指导下，在艾蒲、廖永铭两位同志的热情帮助下写出来的。是“三结合”的产物。也正由于自己向英雄学习得不够，特别是对英雄理解得还不深，因而未能把英雄的精神面貌和崇高的思想品德准确而鲜明地反映出来。我在理解英雄、学习英雄、反映英雄上还只是刚刚学步。我今后一定要努力学习毛主席著作，努力深入火热的斗争，努力提高表现技巧，以英雄为榜样，兢兢业业，不断前进，永远做一名毛泽东思想的宣传员。
