    Ode to Veteran Revolutionaries
    Xi Zhongyang
Instead of singing about young people in the army, I pick up my pen to write a stanza of "Ode to Veteran Generals." The veteran general's temples are already streaked with white, but he willingly serves as a new recruit in the army. Hearing of field training down at the company level, everyone rolls into one big sleeping platform. Collar insignia sewn on by his own hand, backpack packed himself; eating from the same pot during the day, sharing a lamp at night. Seeing the stove fire lit at dawn, he throws on his clothes and heads into the kitchen; hearing of going to the fields to labor, he strides into the ranks and reports his name! A carrying pole always on his shoulder, carrying water from every big and small well along the way; a broom always in his hand, sweeping every village before and after the field training area. When he has time, he often reads Chairman Mao's books, with red and blue pencils and old reading glasses. We say: you are old, you should rest more. He replies: The revolutionary road is still very long!

    革命老将行
    西中扬不唱军中年轻人，提笔写段《老将行》。老将两鬓已斑白，甘作军中一新兵。听说野营下连来，一个统铺大家滚。领章亲手钉，背包自己捆；白天同吃一锅饭，夜晚共照一盏灯。看见清晨灶火亮，披衣就把伙房进；听说下田去劳动，跨进队列报头名！一条扁担常在肩，挑遍一路大小井；一把扫帚常在手，扫遍野营前后村。有空常读毛主席的书，红蓝铅笔老花镜。我们说：你年老应该多休息。他回答：革命道路还长得很！
