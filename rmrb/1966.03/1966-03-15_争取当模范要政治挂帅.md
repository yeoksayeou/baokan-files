    Striving to Be a Model Requires Putting Politics in Command
    Over the years, our team has participated in the construction of many projects, large and small. Our red flag has not fallen for more than ten years. Besides the Party's education and the help of the masses, the fundamental reason is that we never forget to study Chairman Mao's works and never forget to highlight politics.
    In 1954, when we first established the youth shock brigade, the class consciousness of the members was still relatively low. Everyone thought that as long as production was good, it was enough. They worked with the idea of "working hard and striving to be a model." That year, we were named a labor model team, which further encouraged our thinking of only focusing on completing our own production tasks, neglecting other aspects. As a result, we often affected the production of other types of work, our collaborative relationships were not good, and we even had disputes with brother teams. People called us the "fighting team." One year, we not only lost the title of labor model team but were not even named an advanced team. Later, under the education of the Party organization and through studying Chairman Mao's works, we realized that we had not yet established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people and had not yet highlighted politics. From then on, the mental outlook of our team changed greatly, and we were able to work from the perspective of the overall interest. Later, during the construction of the Workers' Stadium, there were seven construction units competing there, and our team always led the way. At that time, we considered that if we continued to work in order to win first place, the carpenters would inevitably be affected; if we took the initiative to stop for a while to create conditions for the carpenters, then the entire project could be completed ahead of schedule. Our team learned from past mistakes and gave the convenient conditions to the carpenters, and the advanced tools to other teams, so that the entire project was completed three days ahead of schedule. Although our team got second place, the members were not discouraged. On the contrary, they felt that doing so was more like the working class.
    These two things tell us a truth: merely being satisfied with one's own temporary good production, without arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and without consciously carrying out the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, one cannot truly do a good job in production.

    Editor's Note: "Striving to be a model" is very bad if it is divorced from the purpose of serving the revolution and the people and takes the road of championism. It is very good if one establishes the idea of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people, looks at things from a broad perspective, starts from the overall interest, and does what this youth shock brigade did after learning from their mistakes. Although they got a "second," from a political and ideological point of view, they are true models.

    争取当模范要政治挂帅
    这些年来，我们队组参加了大大小小许多工程的施工，十多年来红旗不倒，除了党的教导，群众的帮助以外，根本原因是我们时刻不忘记学习毛主席著作，不忘记突出政治。
    一九五四年，我们刚刚建立青年突击队的时候，队员的阶级觉悟还比较低。大家认为只要生产好就行了，抱着“好好干、争取当模范”的思想干活。这年被评上了劳动模范队，更助长了我们只顾完成自己生产任务的思想，其他方面都不顾了。因此常常影响其他工种的生产，协作关系搞得不好，甚至和兄弟队组闹纠纷，人家叫我们“打架队”。有一年，不但丢了劳动模范队的称号，连先进队组也没评上。后来我们在党组织的教育下，又学习了毛主席著作，才认识到，我们还没有树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，还没有突出政治。从此我们队的精神面貌起了很大变化，干活能够从整体利益出发了。后来在工人体育馆施工，当时有七个建筑单位在那里竞赛，我们队一直领先。当时，我们考虑，如果我们为了争取第一继续施工，那么木工势必受到影响；如果我们主动停一停，为木工施工创造条件，那么就可以使整个工程提前完工。我们队接受了过去的教训，把方便条件让给木工，把先进工具让给别的队组，使整个工程提前三天完工。虽然我们队得个第二，队员们不但没有灰心丧气，反而觉得这么做才象工人阶级的样子。
    这两件事告诉我们一个真理：仅仅满足于自己一时的生产好，不用毛泽东思想武装头脑，不能自觉地进行兴无灭资的斗争，便不能真正搞好生产。北京第三建筑工程公司党委副书记　张百发
    编者注：“争取当模范”，如果脱离了为革命为人民的目的，走上锦标主义的道路，就很不好。如果树立了全心全意为革命为人民的思想，遇事从大处着眼，从整体利益出发，象这个青年突击队在接受了教训以后所作的那样，就很好。他们虽然得了个“第二”，从政治思想检查，却是真正的模范。
