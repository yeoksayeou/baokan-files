    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, February 28th - The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Party Committee recently pointed out that the fundamental problem of highlighting politics is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. The meeting called on all cadres in the region, especially those at the county level and above, to place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work and to work hard on the word "use," using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thinking and improve their work.

    The meeting believes that in the past few years, Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of cadres in Ningxia have made achievements in highlighting politics. The main points are: First, they have strengthened the leadership of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, and the broad masses and cadres consciously study Chairman Mao's works, forming an unprecedented mass upsurge. Second, there has been obvious progress in the understanding of class struggle. Third, the mass viewpoint has been further enhanced, and the mass line has been adhered to. Fourth, political work in various regions and systems has been gradually strengthened.

    The meeting pointed out that the current problems in highlighting politics are: Some party members and cadres have purely production viewpoints, purely business viewpoints, and purely technical viewpoints; some people put politics on a par with production, politics on a par with business, and politics on a par with technology, engaging in eclecticism. Some lack a sufficient understanding of the significance of highlighting politics, are busy with business, neglect or relax ideological and political work, and fall into事務主义 (事務主義：roughly translated as '事務主義 (shǐwù zhǔyì)', meaning '事務主義', or '事务主义 (shìwù zhǔyì)' also meaning '事務主義'. This refers to a work style that focuses on administrative details and routine tasks rather than strategic planning or political goals, often implying a lack of vision or initiative').

    The meeting emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought should be used to solve the existing problems in highlighting politics and to further promote the in-depth development of the study movement of Chairman Mao's works. Currently, we must:

    1.  Study Chairman Mao's instructions on politics commanding everything. The vast number of cadres, especially responsible cadres, should adopt the method of rectification, link with reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and improve their understanding of the importance of highlighting politics. All regions and departments should conduct a serious inspection of the issue of highlighting politics and implement measures. 2. We must grasp the problem of leading cadres at the county level and above taking the lead in studying and using. Verbal teaching should be combined with personal example, and personal example is better than verbal teaching. If leading cadres study and use well and set an example in transforming their thinking and improving their work, it is the most practical and powerful way to strengthen the leadership of the study of Chairman Mao's works. 3. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world and the subjective world, first of all, transform the subjective world. 4. We must establish advanced models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and summarize and promote their experience.

    宁夏回族自治区党委常委扩大会议强调
    用毛泽东思想解决突出政治的问题
    据新华社银川二十八日电  中共宁夏回族自治区委员会最近举行的常委扩大会议指出，突出政治的根本问题，是要活学活用毛主席著作。会议号召全区干部特别是县以上干部，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想和改进工作。
    会议认为，几年来，宁夏各级党组织和广大干部在突出政治方面，是有成绩的。主要是：第一，加强了对学习毛主席著作运动的领导，广大群众和干部自觉地学习毛主席著作，形成了前所未有的群众性热潮。第二，对阶级斗争的认识有明显的进步。第三，进一步增强了群众观点，坚持走群众路线。第四，各地区、各系统的政治工作逐步加强。
    会议指出，目前在突出政治方面的问题是：在有些党员和干部中，存在着单纯的生产观点、单纯的业务观点、单纯的技术观点；有些人把政治同生产、政治同业务、政治同技术并列起来，搞折衷主义。有的对突出政治的重大意义认识不足，忙于业务，忽视或放松思想政治工作，陷入事务主义。
    会议强调要用毛泽东思想来解决突出政治方面存在的问题，进一步推进毛主席著作学习运动的深入发展。当前要：
    一、学好毛主席关于政治统帅一切的指示。广大干部特别是负责干部，要采取整风的方法，联系实际，开展批评和自我批评，提高对突出政治的重要性的认识。各地区各部门要对突出政治的问题进行一次认真的检查，落实措施。二、要抓好县以上领导干部带头学、带头用的问题。言教要结合身教，身教胜于言教。领导干部学好用好了，在改造思想、改进工作中做出了榜样，就是最实际、最有力地加强对学习毛主席著作的领导。三、要用毛泽东思想改造客观世界和主观世界，首先是改造主观世界。四、要树立活学活用毛主席著作的先进典型，总结推广他们的经验。
