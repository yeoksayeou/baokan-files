　　Worshipping weapons is a common and incurable disease of imperialism and all reactionary ruling classes. They are all weapon fetishists. They always believe that they can dominate everything with the weapons in their hands, that they can determine the outcome of wars, that they can forever enslave the people of their own country and other countries, and that they can forever maintain their reactionary rule.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The 'theory that weapons decide everything' is a mechanistic view in the matter of war, an opinion that views problems subjectively and one-sidedly." The weapon fetishism of imperialism and reactionaries is linked to their worldview.

    The class position of imperialism and reactionaries determines that their worldview is an idealistic and metaphysical one. They cannot correctly treat the relationship between people and things, and always see things but not people. They are divorced from the people, hostile to the people, unable to believe in the power of the people, and unable to recognize that the masses of the people are the creators of history. It can only be this way. If imperialism truly believed that the power of the people would eventually defeat them, and that the weapons in their hands could not prevent the people's victory, wouldn't that be tantamount to announcing their own demise? Therefore, all reactionaries in history have always created various "theories that weapons decide everything" to scare the people, while in reality, they are also used to deceive themselves.

    However, the war history of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, has repeatedly and eloquently concluded that while weapons are important in war, they are not the decisive factor.

    In the latter half of the 19th century, when breech-loading rifles were invented, Prussian soldiers once believed that with this "continuous volley" gun, "any charge would be impossible, and therefore the bayonet would be completely useless." But in the Austro-Prussian War, it was proven that troops with "courageous charges" could completely break through the firepower of this gun. Therefore, Engels pointed out in his essay on the Austro-Prussian War: "It is people who win the battle, not guns."

    At the end of the 19th century, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany once said self-importantly: "The power of the empire means the power of the navy, and they are interdependent." Wilhelm II arrogantly declared that the fleet of the German Empire would enable it to dominate the world.

    During the First World War, among some Western bourgeois "military strategists," there was a popular "tank-victory theory" and "air-force-victory theory." The British Fuller advocated the decisive role of machinery in war, especially the role of tanks. He wrote: "The superiority or inferiority of weapons is also the victory or defeat of war, and the secret of victory is 99 percent in weapons." The Italian Douhet believed that "the acquisition of air supremacy can be regarded as victory, and being defeated in the air is equivalent to complete defeat."

    By the Second World War, Hitler touted the so-called "blitzkrieg" as miraculous, believing that relying on the power of mechanized troops, he could crush his opponents like lightning from the ground and the air.

    However, whether it is warships, tanks, airplanes, or mechanized troops, etc., they can only play a temporary role in the course of the war, but never a decisive role. The so-called "navy wins," "tanks win," "air force wins," and "blitzkrieg" and other arguments were shattered in the face of human war practice! All these weapons and "theories that weapons decide everything" did not save the failure and demise of Wilhelm II and Hitler.

    After the Second World War, American imperialism became the biggest militarist and believer in "theories that weapons decide everything." It expanded its armaments on an unprecedented scale, and constantly flaunted its so-called "sea and air superiority" and so-called "nuclear deterrent force." In fact, the victories of a series of national revolutionary struggles after the war all declared the bankruptcy of this set of scare tactics of American imperialism.

    China's Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have always been superstitious about weapons, especially American weapons. They regarded "American-equipped" troops as an incredible magic weapon, thinking that they could defeat the Chinese People's Liberation Army with American planes and artillery. However, as early as August 1946, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "What we rely on is only millet plus rifles, but history will ultimately prove that this millet plus rifles is stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's planes plus tanks." The annihilation of the eight million-plus troops of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries has provided the best historical conclusion.

    In the war of aggression against Korea by American imperialism, American weapons were far superior to those of the Korean and Chinese people. But the result of the contest was the defeat of American imperialism and the victory of the Korean and Chinese people.

    Now, American imperialism has sent hundreds of thousands of invading troops with the latest weapons and equipment, dispatched hundreds of warships, including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and more than two thousand aircraft to launch a frenzied offensive against the South Vietnamese people. The South Vietnamese people do not have a single plane or warship, and their weapons and equipment are far behind those of the American invading army. However, the American aggressors were beaten to a pulp on the battlefield by the South Vietnamese people. The heroic South Vietnamese people, with their extraordinary revolutionary heroism and with the strategy and tactics of people's war, once again punctured the tattered armor of American imperialism's "theory that weapons decide everything" in the practice of world people's revolutionary war.

    Opportunists and revisionists in history have always spared no effort to promote "theories that weapons decide everything" in order to meet the needs of the reactionary ruling class. Whenever imperialism mastered one or two new weapons, they would use the new weapons to scare the revolutionary people. In the latter half of the 19th century, when military technology and urban construction made new developments, and breech-loading rifles and shrapnel shells appeared, the leaders of the Second International and the German Social Democratic Party used this as a basis to prove that revolutionary armed struggle was outdated. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bernstein proclaimed that armed uprisings "have lost their effectiveness due to modern urban construction and modern artillery technology."

    Today, after the emergence of nuclear weapons, modern revisionists, inheriting the mantle of those old revisionists, are again using nuclear weapons to scare the revolutionary people. To put it bluntly, they are simply changing the old revisionist motto of "with the emergence of breech-loading rifles, revolution disappears" into "with the emergence of nuclear weapons, revolution disappears."

    However, no weapon can save the lives of reactionaries. Neither imperialists nor revisionists can stop the tide of revolution. When the people become aware and stand up, the weapons in the hands of imperialism and all reactionaries will eventually become scrap metal, while the revolutionary people who have mastered weapons will exert infinite power. The revolutionary people of the world will eventually send imperialism and all reactionaries, along with their various forms of weapon fetishism, into the museum of history.

    武器拜物教的破产
    向东辉
    迷信武器，是帝国主义和一切反动统治阶级的共同的不治之症。他们都是武器拜物教徒。他们总以为，依靠他们手里的武器，就可以主宰一切，可以决定战争胜负，可以永远奴役本国和别国人民，永远维持他们的反动统治。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“‘唯武器论’，是战争问题中的机械论，是主观地和片面地看问题的意见”。帝国主义和反动派的武器拜物教，就是同他们的世界观联系在一起的。
    帝国主义和反动派的阶级地位，决定了他们的世界观是唯心主义的、形而上学的世界观。他们不可能正确地对待人和物的关系，总是见物不见人。他们脱离人民，敌视人民，不可能相信人民的力量，不可能承认人民群众是历史的创造者。事情也只能是这样。如果帝国主义真的相信人民力量终将战胜他们，而他们手里的武器并不能阻止人民的胜利，那岂不就等于宣布自己的灭亡吗？因此，历史上的一切反动派，总是制造各种各样的“唯武器论”，来吓唬人民，同时实际上也是用来欺骗自己。
    但是，古今中外的战争史，已经无数次地、反复地、雄辩地作出结论：武器在战争中虽然是重要的，但不是决定性的因素。
    十九世纪下半叶，当后膛枪发明的时候，普鲁士的军人曾经认为，有了这种“连续齐射”的枪，“任何冲锋都是不可能的，因而刺刀也就完全没有用了”。但在普奥战争中，证明“勇猛冲锋”的部队完全可以冲破这种枪的火力。因此，恩格斯在关于普奥战争的论文中就指出：“赢得战斗胜利的是人，而不是枪。”
    十九世纪末，德皇威廉二世曾经自负地说过：“帝国的力量即意味着海军的力量，它们是互为依赖的”。威廉二世狂妄地宣称，德意志帝国的舰队将使它称霸世界。
    第一次世界大战时，在一些西方资产阶级的“军事家”中间，出现了盛极一时的“坦克制胜论”和“空军制胜论”。英国人富勒鼓吹机械在战争中的决定作用，尤其是坦克的作用。他写道：“武器之优劣，亦即战争之胜负，胜利之秘密百分之九十九在于武器。”意大利人杜黑则认为“制空权的取得，就可算是胜利，在空中被击败，就等于整个败北”。
    到了第二次世界大战，希特勒则把所谓“闪击战”吹得神乎其神，认为依靠机械化部队的威力，就可以从地面和空中，象闪电那样压垮对手。
    然而，不管是兵舰、坦克、飞机，还是机械化部队等等，都只能对战争的进程起暂时的作用，而绝不能起决定作用。所谓“海军制胜”、“坦克制胜”、“空军制胜”和“闪击战”等论调，都在人类的战争实践面前碰得粉碎！所有这些武器和“唯武器论”，并没有挽救威廉二世和希特勒之流的失败和灭亡。
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义又成为最大的黩武主义者和“唯武器论”者。它以空前的规模扩张军备，并且不断地炫耀它的所谓“海空优势”，所谓“核威慑力量”。其实，战后一系列国家的人民革命斗争的胜利，都宣告了美帝国主义这一套吓唬人的家伙的破产。
    中国的蒋介石反动派也一向是迷信武器，特别是迷信美国武器的。他们把“美械化”的军队看作是了不起的法宝，以为靠着美国的飞机大炮，就可以打败中国人民解放军。但是，还在一九四六年八月，毛泽东同志就指出：“我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。”蒋介石反动派的八百多万军队的覆灭，已经作了最好的历史结论。
    在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争中，美国的武器比朝中人民的武器优越得多。但是，较量的结果，是美帝国主义失败了，朝中人民胜利了。
    现在，美帝国主义派遣了几十万拥有最新式武器装备的侵略军，出动了几百艘军舰，包括核动力航空母舰和两千多架飞机，向南越人民发动疯狂进攻。而南越人民没有一架飞机和一艘军舰，武器装备不知道比美国侵略军要落后多少。但是，美国侵略者却在战场上被南越人民打得焦头烂额。英勇的南越人民，用自己非凡的革命英雄主义，以人民战争的战略战术，在世界人民革命战争的实践中，又一次戳穿了美帝国主义“唯武器论”的破烂甲胄。
    历史上的机会主义者、修正主义者，为了适应反动统治阶级的需要，也总是不遗余力地宣扬“唯武器论”。每当帝国主义掌握了一两件新武器，他们就用新武器来吓唬革命的人民。十九世纪下半叶，当军事技术和城市建筑有了新发展，出现了后膛枪和榴霰弹的时候，第二国际和德国社会民主党的领导人就以此为根据，证明革命的武装斗争过时了。二十世纪初，伯恩施坦宣扬说：武装起义“已经由于现代城市建筑和现代枪炮技术而失去效用”。
    今天，当核武器出现以后，现代修正主义者继承着那些老修正主义者的衣钵，又用核武器来吓唬革命人民。说穿了，他们只不过是把“后膛枪出而革命绝迹”这句老修正主义的座右铭，改换成为“核武器出而革命绝迹”罢了。
    但是，任何武器都救不了反动派的命。帝国主义者也好，修正主义者也好，都没有办法阻挡革命的潮流。当人民觉悟起来、站了起来的时候，帝国主义和一切反动派手里的武器都终究要变成废铜烂铁，而掌握了武器的革命人民却要发挥无穷的威力。全世界革命人民，终将把帝国主义和一切反动派，连同他们的各种各样的武器拜物教，统统送进历史博物馆。
