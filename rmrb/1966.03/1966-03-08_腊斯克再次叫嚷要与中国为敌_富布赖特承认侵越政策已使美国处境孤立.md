    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Washington: U.S. government officials continue to clamor for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, conduct war blackmail, and simultaneously intensify their attacks and slanders against China.
    Secretary of State Rusk, in a television program on the 6th, again clamored that the U.S. must "win" in South Vietnam and continue to fulfill its "obligations" there. He said that if the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, it would face "greater dangers than have already been seen." The U.S. aggression against Vietnam has clearly been met with unprecedentedly broad and severe condemnation worldwide, but Rusk, in order to embolden the U.S. to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, went so far as to absurdly boast that many small countries support the U.S. action in Vietnam. He shamelessly lied, saying that if the U.S. wins in Vietnam, then "a hundred small countries will breathe a sigh of relief."
    In his speech, Rusk emphasized attacking China's firm stance against U.S. aggression. He clamored that "it is very important for Peking to come to the conclusion that the use of force is not promising." He said that he agreed with the view of "people in the Communist world - people in Eastern Europe" that the number one problem in the world today is how to make Peking move towards "peaceful coexistence."
    U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, upon arriving in Geneva on the 6th after talks with the British government, also wantonly counter-accused China of pursuing an "aggressive policy."
    U.S. Pacific Armed Forces Commander Sharp clamored at a press conference on the 5th in support of the blockade of Haiphong port in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, proposed by U.S. presidential advisor and former "ambassador" to South Vietnam, Taylor. He said that "from a military point of view, this is a good idea."
    The U.S. government officials' war cries of expanding aggression cannot intimidate the people of various countries fighting against the U.S., but they have aroused endless worries and anxieties and endless disputes within the U.S. ruling clique. Although some representatives of the U.S. ruling clique agree with the Johnson administration's policy of continuing to occupy South Vietnam, they express concern about the consequences of the government's reckless expansion of the war. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright announced on the 6th that the committee would begin a new debate starting on the 8th. Fulbright was particularly worried that the U.S. government's expansion of the war could lead to a Sino-U.S. war "at almost any time." He accused the U.S. of pursuing "traditional policies of old-fashioned imperialism" in Asia. Contrary to Rusk's boasting, Fulbright admitted that the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam has plunged the U.S. into an isolated and helpless predicament, saying that the U.S. has called on its allies to provide assistance to South Vietnam, but other countries have taken a negative attitude, which proves that the U.S. policy is not supported worldwide. Fulbright expressed skepticism about the deceptive propaganda recently touted by the U.S. military that a turn for the better had appeared in Vietnam in favor of the U.S. and South Vietnam, saying, "They told us the same thing in 1962 and 1963."

### 腊斯克再次叫嚷要与中国为敌  富布赖特承认侵越政策已使美国处境孤立

    腊斯克再次叫嚷要与中国为敌
    富布赖特承认侵越政策已使美国处境孤立
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府官员继续叫嚷扩大侵越战争，进行战争讹诈，同时对中国加紧攻击和诬蔑。
    国务卿腊斯克在六日的一次电视节目中再次叫嚷美国要在南越“取胜”，继续履行它在南越的“义务”。他说什么如果美国从越南撤退，就将面临“比现在已经看到的更大的危险”。美国对越南的侵略明明受到全世界空前广泛和严厉的谴责，腊斯克为了替美国扩大侵越战争壮胆，竟荒谬到吹嘘什么有许多小国支持美国在越南的行动。他厚着脸皮说瞎话，说什么如果美国在越南取胜那末“一百个小国将会松一口气”。
    腊斯克在讲话中着重攻击中国坚决反对美国侵略的立场。他叫嚷“使北京得出使用武力是没有前途的这一结论是非常重要的”。他说，他同意“共产党世界里的人——东欧的人”的看法，即今天世界上的头号问题是如何使北京走向“和平共处”。
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在同英国政府会谈后在六日到达日内瓦时，也放肆地反诬中国奉行“侵略政策”。
    美国太平洋武装部队总司令夏普五日在记者招待会上叫嚷支持美国总统顾问、前驻南越“大使”泰勒提出的封锁越南民主共和国的海防港。他说什么“从军事上看这是一个好主意”。
    美国政府大员扩大侵略的战争叫嚣，吓不倒抗美斗争的各国人民，却引起美国统治集团内部无尽的忧虑不安和无止无休的争吵。美国统治集团中的某些代表人物虽然赞成约翰逊政府继续侵占南越的政策，但是对政府不断扩大战争的冒险做法的后果表示担忧。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特六日宣布外委会将从八日起就开始新的辩论。富布赖特特别担心美国政府扩大战争的做法“能在几乎任何时候”引起中美交战。他指责美国在亚洲奉行“老式帝国主义的传统政策”。和腊斯克的吹嘘相反，富布赖特承认美国侵越政策已经使美国陷入孤立无援的困境，他说美国呼吁它的盟国对南越提供援助，但其他国家都持消极态度，这就证明美国的政策在全世界得不到支持。富布赖特对美国军方最近吹嘘的所谓在越南已经出现有利于美国和南越的转折的欺骗宣传表示怀疑，他说，“他们在一九六二年和一九六三年也是这么对我们说的”。
