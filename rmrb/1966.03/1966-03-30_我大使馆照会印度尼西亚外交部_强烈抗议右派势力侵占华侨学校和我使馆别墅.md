    Our Embassy Sends Note to Indonesian Foreign Ministry
    Strongly Protests Right-Wing Forces' Occupation of Overseas Chinese Schools and Our Embassy Villa
    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: On March 27th, our embassy in Indonesia submitted a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, lodging a strong protest with the Indonesian government regarding the serious anti-China incidents of rioters organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces destroying and illegally occupying overseas Chinese schools in West Java, Jakarta, and Makassar. The note pointed out that this is a new step by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and another conspiracy to openly undermine the relations between the two countries.
    The note said that from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on March 12, 1966, thousands of rioters organized by right-wing reactionary forces attacked, destroyed, and illegally occupied 13 overseas Chinese schools in Bandung, including Qinghua, Qiaozhong, and Guanghua. During the attacks on the schools, the rioters shouted anti-China slogans, broke down doors and climbed over walls, forcibly raised the Indonesian flag, destroyed school signs, and wrote slogans such as "Belongs to Kami" (referring to "Indonesian University Students' Action Unity" - Editor's note), "Belongs to Kabi" (referring to "Indonesian Youth Students' Action Unity" - Editor's note), and "Belongs to the Republic of Indonesia" on school doors and walls. The classrooms and offices were covered with anti-China slogans such as "Chinamen go back," Chinese flags and portraits of Chinese national leaders were torn down, Chinese books were burned, and some teaching equipment was destroyed and looted. Even the rice and sugar used by teachers and staff were taken away. They also forced the school authorities to sign documents they had drafted, supposedly "transferring the schools," and arbitrarily announced that the schools had been "closed" and "taken over," forcibly ordering teachers and students to leave. To this day, Qinghua and Guanghua schools are still forcibly occupied by rioters, while the remaining schools are guarded by soldiers sent by the Bandung Garrison Headquarters.
    The note said that from March 14th to 19th, these atrocities against overseas Chinese schools have successively spread to the counties and cities of Bogor, Karawang, Cimahi, Garut, Cianjur, Purwakarta, Sukabumi, and Teluk Betung in West Java. Almost all overseas Chinese schools have been forcibly occupied, and some have been damaged to varying degrees. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 30,000 overseas Chinese primary and secondary school students in West Java alone have been temporarily deprived of schooling, causing widespread panic among the overseas Chinese community.
    The note said that on the afternoon of March 18th, the three overseas Chinese schools in Jakarta, Zhonghua, Qiaozhong, and Beihua, were suddenly attacked by hundreds of people. The rioters carried clubs, iron bars, iron chains, daggers, and other sharp weapons, and forcibly broke into the schools, destroying doors, windows, furniture, and teaching equipment, burning Chinese books and stationery, tearing up Chinese flags and portraits of Chinese national leaders, and writing various insulting and anti-China slogans on the walls. At Zhonghua Middle School, teachers and students were openly subjected to body searches, even punched and kicked, and arbitrarily insulted. Three students at the school were injured, and one student was kidnapped.
    In Makassar, on March 18th, seven overseas Chinese schools were harassed by hundreds of rioters, who wrote the names of various right-wing groups on the doors and walls of these schools.
    The note emphasized that this is a new step by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and another conspiracy to openly undermine the relations between the two countries.
    The note demanded that the Indonesian government immediately take effective measures to stop the atrocities against overseas Chinese schools in various places, investigate the perpetrators and instigators, compensate for all losses suffered by the overseas Chinese schools, return the schools still occupied by rioters and guarded by the military so that all schools can quickly resume classes, and hopes to effectively guarantee the safety of teachers and students in the future and prevent similar incidents from happening again.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Jakarta News: On March 28th, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, lodging a strong protest against the illegal occupation of the embassy villa by rioters organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
    Hundreds of rioters organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces arrived at the gate of the Chinese Embassy villa in Cibarengkok, Bogor on March 19th in trucks, forcibly broke into the compound, coerced the staff in charge of guarding the villa to open the doors, arbitrarily searched, damaged, and looted the property inside. Afterwards, these rioters openly declared: "The embassy villa has been occupied" and "has been taken over." They also wrote the words "Belongs to the Republic of Indonesia" on the door of the villa building. As of March 26th, more than 20 rioters were still staying in the villa.
    In the protest note, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia pointed out that the above incident is extremely serious. The Chinese Embassy villa is part of the diplomatic residence of the embassy, and is the property of the Chinese diplomatic mission, which has been officially registered long ago. In order to further worsen the relations between the two countries, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have so arbitrarily violated diplomatic privileges and so rudely trampled on international law, which is rare in international relations.
    In the protest note, the Chinese Embassy demanded that the Indonesian government publicly apologize for this incident, immediately expel the rioters occupying the embassy villa, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators, compensate for all losses in the embassy villa, and take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese diplomatic missions and their personnel, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

    我大使馆照会印度尼西亚外交部
    强烈抗议右派势力侵占华侨学校和我使馆别墅
    新华社二十九日讯  我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆三月二十七日向印度尼西亚共和国外交部提交一份照会，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒破坏和非法侵占西爪哇、雅加达和望加锡等地区华侨学校的严重反华事件向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈抗议。照会指出，这是印度尼西亚右派反动势力一个反华排华的新步骤，是公然破坏两国关系的又一次阴谋活动。
    照会说，一九六六年三月十二日上午十一点至下午五点，右派反动势力组织的数以千计的暴徒，分批袭击、破坏和非法侵占了万隆市的清华、侨中、广华等十三所华侨学校。暴徒在袭击各该学校的过程中，曾狂呼反华口号，破门翻墙而入，强升了印度尼西亚国旗，毁坏校牌，并在学校门墙上涂写“属于卡米”（“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”——编者注）、“属于卡比”（“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”——编者注）、“属于印度尼西亚共和国”等字样，在学校教室、办公处涂满了“支那人滚回去”等反华标语、撕毁了中国国旗和中国国家领导人的挂象，焚烧了中文书籍，捣毁和劫走了部分教学设备，即使教职员用的米、糖等食物也被拿走。他们还百般胁迫各校负责人在其拟就的所谓“移交学校”的文件上签字，并擅自宣布学校已被“封闭”、“接管”，强令师生离校。至今清华、广华两校仍为暴徒强占，其余各校则交由万隆市基地司令部派出军人驻守。
    照会说，自三月十四日至十九日，对华侨学校的这种暴行，已相继扩展到西爪哇所属的茂物、格拉旺、芝马墟、牙律、展玉、普禾加达、苏甲巫眉、斗旺等县市，几乎所有华侨学校都被强占，有的还遭到了不同程度的破坏。据不完全统计，仅西爪哇即有因此而暂时失学的华侨中小学生约达三万人左右，且引起了广大华侨的惶惶不安。
    照会说，三月十八日下午，雅加达的中华、侨众、北华三所华侨学校，遭到了数百人的突然袭击，暴徒携带木棒、铁棍、铁链、短刀等利器，分头强行冲入校内，捣毁了门窗、家具和教学设备，焚烧了中文书籍、文具用品，撕碎了中国国旗和中国国家领导人的挂象，在墙上也涂写了各种辱华、反华标语。在中华中学还公然对师生强行搜身，甚至拳打脚踢，肆意侮辱，该校有三名学生被殴伤，一名学生被绑架。
    在望加锡，三月十八日有七所华侨学校受到数以百计的暴徒的骚扰，并在这些学校的门墙上涂写属于各种右派团体所有的字样。
    照会强调指出，这是印度尼西亚右派反动势力一个反华排华的新步骤，是公然破坏两国关系的又一次阴谋活动。
    照会要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取有效措施，制止对各地华侨学校的暴行，追究肇事者和主使人，赔偿华侨学校所遭受的一切损失，对仍被暴徒侵占和军队驻守的学校应即予归还，以便各校能够全部迅速复课，并希望切实保障学校师生今后的安全，不再发生类似事件。
    新华社二十九日讯  雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆三月二十八日照会印度尼西亚共和国外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒非法侵占大使馆别墅提出强烈的抗议。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒数百名，三月十九日分乘卡车，到达座落于茂物芝巴榕的中国大使馆别墅门前，强行冲入院内，胁迫看管别墅的工作人员，打开房门，肆意搜查、毁坏和抢掠室内财物，随后这些暴徒公然声言：“大使馆别墅已被占领”，而且“已被接管”。他们并且在别墅楼所门口涂写“属于印度尼西亚共和国”的字样。截至三月二十六日止，还有暴徒二十多名留居在别墅里。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆在抗议照会中指出，上述事件是极端严重的。中国大使馆别墅是大使馆外交官住地的一部分，是属于中国外交代表机构的产业，早已正式登记在案。印度尼西亚右派反动势力为了进一步恶化两国关系，竟如此恣意侵犯外交特权，如此粗暴蹂躏国际法准则，这在国际关系中是罕见的。
    中国大使馆在抗议照会中要求印度尼西亚政府对此事件公开道歉，立即驱逐侵占大使馆别墅的暴徒，严惩肇事者和主使人，赔偿大使馆别墅内的一切损失，并且采取有效措施保障中国外交代表机构及其人员的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。
