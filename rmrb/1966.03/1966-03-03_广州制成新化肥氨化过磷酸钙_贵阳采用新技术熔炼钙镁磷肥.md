    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou – A new type of chemical fertilizer, ammoniated superphosphate of lime, has recently been officially put into production at the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant.

    This fertilizer, also known as ammoniated ordinary calcium superphosphate, is a nitrogen-phosphorus compound fertilizer. It was successfully trial-produced through cooperation between the Nanjing Chemical Research Institute, after achieving preliminary research results, and the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and the South China Institute of Technology.

    Ammoniated superphosphate of lime is more effective than ordinary phosphate fertilizer. Experiments conducted by the Nanjing Chemical Research Institute show that applying ammoniated superphosphate of lime to green manure crops, leguminous crops, wheat, rice, cotton, and other crops results in varying degrees of increased production. The effects are even better when applied to crops like hairy vetch, milk vetch, broad beans, and peas. Experiments conducted by the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in late rice paddies using this fertilizer showed that one jin of ammoniated superphosphate of lime could increase rice yield by more than three jin.

    The production process of ammoniated superphosphate of lime is not very complex, the equipment is relatively simple, the investment is small, and the output is large, making it possible for general small and medium-sized fertilizer plants to produce it.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang – The Guiyang Calcium Carbide Plant has successfully adopted a new high-voltage dolomite pre-calcination technology, reducing the electricity consumption per ton of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer from 1,036 kilowatt-hours to 719 kilowatt-hours. According to the factory's calculations, simply adopting this technical measure will save the country more than 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Daily output has increased by approximately 30 percent, and 80 percent of the products have reached the standard of top-grade products.

    广州制成新化肥氨化过磷酸钙
    贵阳采用新技术熔炼钙镁磷肥
    新华社广州电　一种新的化学肥料——氨化过磷酸钙，最近在广州氮肥厂正式投入生产。
    这种化肥又名氨化普钙，是一种氮磷复合肥料。它是南京化工研究院在取得初步研究成果之后，与广州氮肥厂、华南工学院合作试制成功的。
    氨化过磷酸钙比一般磷肥的肥效好。南京化工研究院试验的情况表明，绿肥作物、豆科作物、小麦、水稻、棉花等作物施用氨化过磷酸钙，都有不同程度的增产，苕子、紫云英、蚕豆、豌豆等作物施用这种新化肥效果更好。湖南农业科学院用这种肥料在晚稻田上试验，一斤氨化过磷酸钙能增产稻谷三斤多。
    氨化过磷酸钙的生产流程不很复杂，设备比较简单，投资少，产量大，一般中小型化肥厂都能生产。
    据新华社贵阳电　贵阳电石厂成功地采用了高电压白云石预锻烧新技术，把每吨钙镁磷肥的耗电量由一千零三十六度降到了七百一十九度。据工厂计算，只是采用这项技术措施，全厂每年就可以为国家节约电力一百二十多万度。日产量提高百分之三十左右，百分之八十的产品都达到了特级品标准。
