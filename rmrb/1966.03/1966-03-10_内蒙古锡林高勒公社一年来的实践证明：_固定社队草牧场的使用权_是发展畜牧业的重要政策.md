    Inner Mongolia Xilin Gol Commune's Practice Over the Past Year Proves:
    Fixed Usage Rights for People's Commune and Brigade Grasslands Are an Important Policy for Developing Animal Husbandry
    Correctly implementing this policy has mobilized the enthusiasm of herdsmen to build grasslands, which is conducive to fully tapping the potential of grasslands and also enhances unity among herdsmen.
    (Our report) The implementation of fixed grassland usage rights in Xilin Gol Commune, Alxa Left Banner, Inner Mongolia, has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of herdsmen and grassroots cadres in building grasslands. The entire commune has formulated a five-year grassland construction plan and is enthusiastically carrying out multiple grassland construction activities such as planting pasture forage, digging wells, planting trees, and closing off滩 (tan) to cultivate grass.
    This commune is adjacent to five communes including Muren Gaole and Bayan Jilantai. The commune has five production brigades and a Karakol sheep farm. Before the grassland usage rights were fixed, the unclear boundaries within and outside the commune caused disorderly抢放 (qiang fang, chaotic grazing) of grasslands at the border areas, leading to overgrazing. This phenomenon was particularly serious during drought years. In order to resolve grassland conflicts within and outside the commune, rationally utilize grasslands, and strengthen grassland construction, last year the Banner working group conducted a pilot project in this commune to fix grassland usage rights, clearly delineating the grassland boundaries with the five adjacent communes and fixing the grassland usage rights of the five production brigades and the Karakol sheep farm.
    Throughout the process of fixing grassland usage rights, they consistently adhered to the principles of "referencing history, taking care of reality, benefiting production, and benefiting unity" and the working method of the mass line. At the beginning of the work, they organized responsible comrades of relevant communes, team cadres, and representatives of poor herdsmen to study and discuss the Inner Mongolia Grassland Management Trial Regulations (draft), enabling everyone to have a relatively deep understanding of the spirit and essence of the policy of fixing grassland usage rights, and dispelling various ideological concerns of cadres and herdsmen such as fearing that animal husbandry would be restricted, grazing would be inconvenient, and cooperation would be difficult after a disaster after the boundaries were drawn. Then, on-the-spot surveys were conducted, in-depth investigations were carried out, examining both historical boundaries and the current grassland ownership and basic construction situation of both parties, and widely listening to the opinions of poor herdsmen and team cadres on the division of grasslands. Finally, a practical and acceptable grassland boundary was proposed, submitted to representatives of both parties for discussion, supplemented, modified, and finally fixed.
    On the basis of clarifying grassland boundaries and fixing usage rights, the commune and brigades established grassland management committees, formulated detailed grassland management rules, and strengthened grassland construction. With the help of relevant departments in the banner, the commune’s grasslands were surveyed on site, and grassland improvement and construction plans were proposed according to grassland types. The commune’s preliminary plan is to establish relatively stable hayfields within five years, with an annual hay production of 2 million jin, and a forage base with a yield of more than 300 jin per mu, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in forage. Within five years, 1.4 million trees will be planted, and grassland will be closed for breeding and replanting to update it, water conservancy construction will be carried out, grassland rodent damage will be eliminated, and the grassland carrying capacity will be increased, and so on. Since the beginning of this year, they have taken active action, with each team afforesting, closing off滩 (tan) to cultivate grass for more than 20,000 mu, establishing 3,000 mu of hayfields, and artificially planting 730 mu of forage. In addition, the work of digging new wells and repairing old wells is also actively underway.
    After a year of practice, fixing grassland usage rights has many benefits and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of herdsmen. First, it promotes the establishment of revolutionary thinking among the people in pastoral areas to build grasslands and carry out basic water and grass construction in a planned way. After fixing grassland usage rights in this commune, the herdsmen said: "Now that the grassland boundaries between communes and between teams are clear, there is no more chaotic抢牧 (qiang mu, chaotic grazing) phenomenon. We must protect and improve the grasslands well." The team cadres reflected: "Now that the grassland has been fixed for our brigade to use, the task of building the grassland has also been handed over to us. To develop animal husbandry, we must rely on this grassland. Our brigade must build this grassland well." This year, Lao'ertao Brigade dug a deep well, Karakol Sheep Farm dug two deep wells, and both Shalabu'erdu and Xinjing Brigades transferred labor to build houses and sheds on winter camps. Second, it is conducive to fully exploiting the potential of grasslands and rationally utilizing grasslands. After the grassland usage rights were fixed, all brigades protected winter and spring camps and hayfields, and implemented a seasonal rotational grazing system. The Xinjing and Chahanbuluge Brigades also set aside their own emergency grazing lands to prevent and overcome possible natural disasters. Third, it is also conducive to unity among herdsmen. Before the fixed grassland usage rights, there was mutual cross-border grazing, neither contact nor recognition of grassland boundaries, disorderly grazing, which was not conducive to protecting the grasslands and also affected the unity among herdsmen. After the fixed grassland usage rights, when cross-border grazing is required, they can proactively contact and seek the consent of the other party, and the other party can also enthusiastically help, and the unity among herdsmen has also been enhanced.

### 内蒙古锡林高勒公社一年来的实践证明：  固定社队草牧场的使用权  是发展畜牧业的重要政策

    内蒙古锡林高勒公社一年来的实践证明：
    固定社队草牧场的使用权  是发展畜牧业的重要政策
    正确执行这项政策，调动了牧民建设草原的积极性，有利于充分挖掘草场潜力，也增强了牧民间的团结
    本报讯  内蒙古阿拉善左旗锡林高勒公社，实行固定草牧场使用权以后，大大激发了广大牧民和基层干部建设草原的积极性。全社已经制订了五年草原建设规划，热情洋溢地进行种植牧草饲料、打井、植树和封滩育草等多项草原建设活动。
    这个公社与木仁高勒、巴音吉兰太等五个公社毗邻，公社内有五个生产大队和一个卡拉库尔羊场。草场没有固定使用权以前，由于社内外界线不清，造成交界处草场乱抢乱放，出现啃食过度现象。特别是干旱年头，这种现象更为严重。为了解决社内外草场矛盾，合理利用草场，加强草原建设，去年，旗工作组在这个公社进行了固定草牧场使用权的试点，划清了与相邻五个公社的草牧场界线，固定了五个生产大队和卡拉库尔羊场的草场使用权。
    在固定草牧场使用权工作中，他们自始至终坚持了“参照历史，照顾现实，有利生产，有利团结”的原则，和群众路线的工作方法。工作一开始，他们便组织有关公社负责同志、队干部和贫苦牧民代表学习讨论了内蒙古草原管理试行条例（草案），使大家对固定草牧场使用权政策的精神实质，有了比较深刻的了解，解除了干部和牧民中怕划界后畜牧业受限制、放牧不方便、受灾后协作困难等种种思想顾虑。然后又进行了实地勘测，深入调查，既看历史界线，又看现在双方占有的草场情况和基本建设情况，广泛听取贫苦牧民和队干部对划分草场的意见。最后，才提出一个切实可行的、双方能够接受的草场界线，交给双方代表讨论，经过补充、修改，最后固定下来。
    在划清草牧场界线，固定使用权的基础上，社、队都成立了草原管理委员会，制订了草原管理细则，加强草原建设。在旗有关部门的帮助下，实地勘测了全社草场，分草场类型提出了改良建设规划。这个社初步规划，在五年内建立起比较稳产的打草场，年产草量要达到二百万斤，饲料基地每亩产量要达到三百斤以上，做到饲草饲料自给自足。五年内要种树一百四十万株，并要封育补播更新草场，开展水利建设，消灭草原鼠害，提高草场载畜量，等等。今年以来，他们已积极行动起来，队队造了林，封滩育草两万多亩，建立打草场三千亩，人工种植饲草饲料七百三十亩，此外，打新井、修旧井等工作也在积极进行中。
    经过一年的实践，固定草牧场使用权有很多的好处，它受到广大牧民的热烈拥护。一，促使牧区人民树立起建设草原的革命思想，有计划地进行水草基本建设。这个公社固定草牧场使用权后，牧民们说：“现在社与社、队与队之间，草场界线明确了，再没有乱抢乱牧现象了，我们要很好地保护和改良草场。”队干部反映：“现在把草场固定给我们大队使用了，把建设草原的任务也交给我们了，要发展畜牧业，就要靠这块草场，我们大队一定要把这块草场建设好”。今年老尔套大队打深井一眼，卡拉库尔羊场打深井两眼，沙拉布尔都和新井两个大队都抽调劳动力，在冬营地上盖房屋搭棚圈。二，有利于充分挖掘草场潜力，合理利用草场。草场使用权固定后，各大队都保护了冬春营地和打草场，实行了分季轮牧制。新井和查汉布鲁格两个大队，还留出了自己的备荒草场，以预防和战胜可能发生的自然灾害。三，也有利于牧民之间的团结。固定草牧场使用权以前，互相越界放牧，既不联系，也不承认草场界线，乱放乱牧，对保护草场不利，也影响牧民之间的团结。固定草牧场使用权以后，需要越界放牧时，都能主动联系，征求对方同意，对方也能热情帮助，牧民之间的团结也增强了。
