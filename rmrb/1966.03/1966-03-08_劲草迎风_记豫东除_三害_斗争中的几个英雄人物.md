    Editor's Note: In recent years, under the correct leadership of our Party, the people of eastern Henan have waged an arduous struggle to transform the world. The struggle against natural disasters, like other revolutionary undertakings, is a matter for the broad masses themselves. The disaster relief struggle in eastern Henan was carried out by outstanding Party cadres like Jiao Yulu, leading millions of heroic masses. Here, we introduce to readers several heroic figures.
    The times create heroes. In the era of Mao Zedong, what guides our actions is Mao Zedong Thought. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought gives us a scientific worldview and a firm, correct direction; mastering Mao Zedong Thought gives us a dauntless revolutionary spirit and the ability to understand the laws of development of things. In a word, mastering Mao Zedong Thought allows us to temper ourselves into proletarian fighters of both wisdom and courage in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. The heroic figures introduced in this newsletter hold different positions from Comrade Jiao Yulu and shoulder different tasks. Because they armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they demonstrated great wisdom and courage in the fight against waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinity, and achieved great victories.
    "For truly great men, look to this age alone." The heroic people of eastern Henan say it well: Now that we are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the three disasters of waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinity can no longer play tricks on us at will!

    It is often said: A strong wind tests the strength of the grass. In the arduous struggle against waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinity in eastern Henan, there emerged excellent Communist Party members and outstanding mass leaders like Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee, as well as tens of thousands of cadres, Communist Party members, and poor and lower-middle peasants who stood tall and firm in the face of natural disasters. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to bravely fight against the "three pests," demonstrating a strong and unyielding spirit. They are heroes who turned the tide of natural disasters.
    Not long ago, we visited these heroic figures in eastern Henan.
    At that time, it was the severe winter season on the eastern Henan plain. The entire eastern Henan region displayed a magnificent picture of transforming nature and fighting disasters: along ditches and canals, people shouted slogans, dredging waterways; on the sandy plains of the old Yellow River course, people were busy building forest belts, blocking wind gaps, and locking down sand dragons; on the more than three hundred *li* long Yellow River "seepage belt," people started early and worked late, rushing to build farmland resistant to and preventing salinity, giving the saline-alkali depressions a new look. …
    The people of eastern Henan said: The three demons and monsters of waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinity can no longer play tricks on us at will. Now that we are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will rely on our own hands to control nature and create a new socialist eastern Henan!
    The Person Who Carries "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to Fight Disasters
    The disaster area in eastern Henan includes fourteen counties in the two districts of Kaifeng and Shangqiu. Zhuqiao Brigade in Heji Commune, Ju County, has 2,200 mu of arable land, of which 1,600 mu were originally alkaline land. At that time, people said that this area was "wind blows up white clouds, snow all over the ground in June," and "no need to light a lantern to walk at night." Since the establishment of advanced cooperatives, this area has suffered from alkalinity, waterlogging, and drought every year. The Ju County Party Committee and the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee sent working groups every year, issuing relief grain and relief funds, but could not fill this "hole." Some people said: This place in Zhuqiao can only be used for planting trees! Some people said: The land in Zhuqiao can only be used to grow *tianjing* (a kind of alkali-resistant and waterlogging-resistant leguminous green manure crop)!
    Is it true that the soil and water of Zhuqiao really cannot support people? Is it true that this place in Zhuqiao cannot carry out revolution?
    In November 1964, the County Party Committee sent another working group to Zhuqiao. As soon as they entered the village, the brigade cadres asked, "How much grain and money did you bring this time?" The comrades of the working group said, "We didn't bring grain or money, only a few copies of *The Road of Dazhai*." Upon hearing this, the brigade cadres snorted and said, "This old alkaline nest, what Dazhai are we learning from!"
    A few days later, County Head Zhang Hongyuan also went. The brigade cadres surrounded him again: "County Head, how much grain and money did you bring us?" Zhang Hongyuan took out the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* and said, "I didn't bring anything, just brought you this book!"
    The next day, Zhang Hongyuan convened a commune member meeting, vigorously talking to the commune members about the ambition of the foolish old man who moved the mountain, and vigorously talking about the story of Dazhai's self-reliance and transformation of the world, and expressed his determination to transform this old alkaline nest together with everyone. After speaking, he dropped his cotton coat and led the commune members to the field to pull plows. On the spot, some commune members were so moved that they said with tears in their eyes: In the old society, seeing officials brought disaster, but now a county head over fifty years old comes to plow with us, how can we lie down and not work?
    After this, learning from Dazhai was more ingrained. Poor peasant Zhu Huaixun said: After eating subsidized grain for eight years, our brigade has not become rich, and some people are getting lazier with more relief. After all is said and done, we still don't have ambition! That winter, more than seventy poor and lower-middle peasant households asked the state to reduce their relief, and they also gave more than 7,000 *jin* of relief grain and more than 200 yuan of loans that had already been sent to the village to brigades with greater difficulties.
    The struggle to transform saline-alkali land began. There were eighteen *mu* of old alkaline land southwest of Zhuqiao, which was said to have not grown crops for sixty years. The Communist Party members of the Third Production Team peeled off a layer of this eighteen *mu* of land, dug away the topsoil alkaline soil, threw it into deep ditches, and then paved a layer of good soil on it and planted cotton. Many people's shoulders were swollen, but they were rewarded with a lush cotton seedlings. In the autumn, this eighteen *mu* of cotton yielded more than 500 *jin* of ginned cotton for the first time. The commune members of the Sixth Production Team dug out the black silt from five old pits and spread it evenly on twelve *mu* of old alkaline land to a thickness of half a foot. When millet was planted, the yield per *mu* was more than 400 *jin*.
    In the Zhuqiao saline-alkali nest, where there was "snow all over the ground in June," a green appeared in the autumn of 1965. In the autumn of this year, the commune originally planned to supply Zhuqiao with 60,000 *jin* of grain, but Zhuqiao not only didn't want it, but also sold more than 6,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state, and the brigade also reserved 5,000 *jin*. This year, the entire brigade bought twenty large and small animals, fifty large and medium-sized farm tools, and collectively built forty new houses.
    From then on, Zhuqiao, the old alkaline nest, became a golden rice bowl.
    Comrades from some county party committees in eastern Henan told us that in some old disaster areas, some cadres and masses have undergone a major change in their thinking about disaster relief. In previous years, they also said that they relied on the state for food, relief funds for spending, free medical treatment for illnesses, and machines for farming (tractor tillage). However, when they read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and picked up the "self-reliance" golden cudgel given to them by the Party to subdue demons and eliminate harm, the situation changed greatly. The cadres and people in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan deeply realized from practice that the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and striving for progress is a priceless treasure given to the people of eastern Henan by the Party. It is thousands of times, tens of thousands of times more precious than tens of thousands of *jin* of relief grain and tens of thousands of yuan of relief funds!
    New Foolish Old Man Dares to Subdue "Three Pests" Paper Tiger
    If the "three pests" of eastern Henan are compared to tigers, then among the eight million people of eastern Henan, there are many "tiger-fighting heroes."
    Tushanzhai in Minquan County is a village on the edge of the old Yellow River course in the Qing Dynasty. The old abandoned Yellow River embankment, like a sand dragon, tightly surrounded most of it. Every spring and autumn, when a level four or five wind blows, the village is dark, like a layer of turbid yellow dust and mist. When people steamed buns, the lid was opened, and there was a layer of sand on the buns; when they held a bowl to drink soup, there was a layer of yellow soil on the soup. It was even more terrible when a level seven or eight wind blew. It howled, uprooting crops, and peeling off a layer of several inches thick from the flat ground. The rolled gravel could sometimes fill wells and dig graves, burying villages. A few *li* north of Tushanzhai, there is a Da Houji. It used to be a town shop with more than 300 households. Due to the cruel oppression and exploitation of the feudal ruling class and the sandstorms, only a few households were left before liberation. In 1962, a strong wind leveled seven wells in Tushanzhai. That year, 150 mu of land was planted with sorghum from spring to autumn, and wheat was planted. It was killed by wind and sand once planted; replanted, and killed again; after planting seven crops in a row, only 30% of the seedlings survived. 150 mu of land only harvested 72 *jin* of wheat.
    Some commune members said discouragedly: "Our Tushanzhai will become Da Houji sooner or later! To control the sand, unless all the men die and the women marry away." "Sand, sand, you have harmed me so that I can't marry a wife, and even blew away my sons and grandsons."
    Zhao Hongjun, the secretary of the brigade party branch, was thinking about the *Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain* spirit taught by Chairman Mao. The mountain of sandstorms has been weighing on the people of Tushanzhai for many years, and Zhao Hongjun thought about moving this mountain away.
    On windy days, he wore a burlap sheet and walked from here to there, braving the wind and sand, squatting and looking from time to time. Once, he lay on the ground and observed the flowing sand on the flat ground rushing like flowing water, making a rustling sound. Before long, a small sand dune accumulated behind him. - The "fuse" to control the sand was found. He jumped up in surprise.
    "First dig ditches and build walls to bury and block the sand; then plant trees to control the sand."
    The brigade party branch formulated a plan to dig sand-prevention ditches and build sand-prevention walls. The Communist Party members studied and discussed *The Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain*.
    "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's words are like a bright light, illuminating the path of the Communist Party members of Tushanzhai; like a bugle call, inspiring the combat passion of the Communist Party members of Tushanzhai to march towards the wind and sand.
    They said, "Mount Taihang and Mount Wangwu only blocked the Foolish Old Man's way; but this mountain above our heads blocks our eating, drinking, and wearing, which is more hateful than Mount Taihang and Mount Wangwu. We must move it away!" "Wind and sand are tigers, we have Jingde's whip!"
    Zhao Hongjun led thirty-one Communist Party members from the village to set up a tiger-fighting formation. The "Jingde whip" they held was the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain learned from Chairman Mao's books.
    It was in the depths of winter, and it was snowing heavily. Most of the commune members were still skeptical about digging ditches and building walls to prevent sand, but thirty-one Communist Party members stood firm on the "position" day and night. They broke open the foot-deep frozen soil and dug ditches to build walls. This was a "Huaihai Campaign" in Tushanzhai's conquest of sandstorms. If this battle was won, they could gain a firm foothold on the dunes; if they did not win, they would really become Da Houji. They shouted: "Dig, one shovel of sand is one shovel of grain!" "Snatch food from the tiger's mouth!"
    When the project of digging ditches and building walls was in full swing, a northwest wind suddenly rose. After the wind and sand, the commune members all ran to the fields to see. It turned out that in the places where ditches had been dug and walls had been built, the flying sand was buried in the ditches and blocked at the foot of the walls, and the wheat seedlings were still green; in the places where there was no time to dig ditches and build walls, about 100 mu of wheat seedlings were either killed or buried alive.
    A big wind opened people's eyes, and bad things turned into good things. The commune members also picked up iron shovels and followed the thirty-one Communist Party members to dig ditches and build walls. This winter and spring, the people of Tushanzhai spent forty-two days digging seventy-two sand-prevention ditches, seventy-four *li* long, and building seventy-two sand-prevention walls. The ditches and walls protected dozens of *mu* of wheat and had a meager harvest. The people of Tushanzhai, who had not eaten wheat for many years, ate white noodles.
    Digging ditches and building walls is only a temporary solution after all. The fundamental solution is to plant trees. After gaining a foothold, the Tushanzhai Party Branch then led the masses to plant trees in the spring of 1963. How to plant trees without saplings? Mobilize party members to exchange saplings and resolutely not reach out to the state. Some people took money to buy them, and some went to relatives to borrow them. Some people sold eggs and bought willow rafters to plant. The actions of party members and cadres motivated the commune members. That spring, they planted more than 70,000 saplings on the abandoned Yellow River embankment, and then planted more than 300,000 saplings.
    Chairman Mao's book gave the people of Tushanzhai a great force, and they used the "Jingde whip" to subdue the "sand tiger" for the first time. Since 1964, there have been no more disasters of crops being killed or buried alive by wind and sand. Tushanzhai, which had been eating state-supplied grain for seven consecutive years, took off the hat of grain-deficient households in 1965, sold more than 45,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state, and the brigade also reserved more than 40,000 *jin*.
    Like the people of Tushanzhai, who moved mountains like the Foolish Old Man, there are such people in the old low-lying nests and old alkaline nests in eastern Henan, and in many places. The spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain armed the people of eastern Henan to dare to fight against the "three pests," and in the process of fighting against the "three pests," tens of thousands of new Foolish Old Man of the socialist era have grown up.
    "Let Me Add to the State's Granary"
    More and more production brigades and production teams in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan have turned themselves around in one year or even one season, and can be self-sufficient and no longer need relief from the state. This is a major event worthy of special mention in the history of eastern Henan. However, if it is therefore believed that the struggle of the people in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan to eliminate the "three pests" is solely for themselves, then that is wrong. What they have in their hearts are three big words: for the revolution.
    South of the Yellow River embankment and on both sides of the Longhai Railway in eastern Henan, there is a narrow Yellow River seepage zone, which is the area with the most severe saline-alkali disaster. The Yellow River seepage zone is four *li* wide and more than 300 *li* long. At its eastern end, Sunliukou Commune in Minquan County, there is a famous poor team, which people call the "Rotten Fifth Team" because it is poor.
    In the autumn of 1964, the "Rotten Fifth Team" won the first good year in many years and became a self-sufficient team. The commune members were full of joy, pulled carts, loaded 380 *jin* of soybeans, and went to the grain station to sell surplus grain. When the grain receiver saw that the beans were too damp, without asking which team they were from, he told them to go back and dry them before selling them. The commune members went to the grain station for the second time with a cart, but the grain station did not collect them. It turned out that after the grain station inquired, they knew that they were the "five guarantees team" who had been eating state-supplied grain for many years, and told them to pull them back again. However, the commune members of the "Rotten Fifth Team" were unwilling. For the third time, they pulled 380 *jin* of soybeans to the grain station. They said to the cadres of the grain station: "We have eaten state-supplied grain for many years, one bowl contains grain from more than a dozen provinces; this year, we should take our grain and mix it with the national grain. Let me add to the state's granary." The cadres of the grain station were extremely moved and accepted it. In the autumn of 1965, the "Rotten Fifth Team" sold more than 4,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state.
    Whether it is 380 *jin* or 4,000 *jin*, "the gift is light but the affection is heavy!" What they are handing over is not grain, but clearly the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the disaster area! The commune members of the "Rotten Fifth Team" carried out such an unyielding struggle in the old alkaline nest in order to add this grain to the state warehouse!
    Lu Xingpeng, the captain of the "Rotten Fifth Team" and a Communist Party member, was elected by the commune members in the summer of 1963. The "Rotten Fifth Team" is Lu Xingpeng's hometown. After three applications, he gave up the position of commune accountant and gave up his salary to return to the "Rotten Fifth Team". He said: "Communist Party members should go to the most difficult places. I can't watch the production team rely solely on state support without making any contribution."
    When Lu Xingpeng first became the captain, the "Rotten Fifth Team" was extremely poor. He slept on the same bed with the poor and lower-middle peasants and told them the principle of self-reliance. He and the deputy captain got up at the third crow of the rooster and pulled manure to the field. He and the young people pulled the drill to sow wheat. He and the production team's accountant and custodian pulled foot on the team, carrying heavy loads back and forth, gnawing on cornbread on the road. He led the commune members to turn the soil to suppress alkali, build strip fields, and manage the crops one by one in the interspersed alkaline land. …
    The "Rotten Fifth Team" finally turned over in the hands of Lu Xingpeng and the poor and lower-middle peasants. They only used more than a year to realize their ideal: not to rely on state support, but to contribute to the state.
    Dozens of *li* away from the "Rotten Fifth Team," Kongji Commune in Ningling County has a "Poor Fifth Team," which also has a good story about selling "revolutionary grain."
    The "Poor Fifth Team" is also on the Yellow River seepage zone, and the fields are a white expanse of saline-alkali. In the past, the eating, clothing, and spending of all the team members were basically covered by the state. From 1963, production team leader Cao Yujiang led the commune members to adopt comprehensive methods to control alkali. In the wheat season of 1964, there was surplus grain for the first time. After the wheat harvest, Cao Yujiang led a dozen commune members, pulling and carrying, and happily sent 1,000 *jin* of wheat to the grain purchasing station. The cadres of the grain station recognized that they came from the "Poor Fifth Team" and said: "Comrades, this is the first year of turning over, so pull it back to the production team and keep it to pad the bottom of the warehouse!" The commune members said: "No, no. We have eaten state-supplied grain for many years. This year, the Party led us to turn over and we have surplus grain, so we must sell it." One insisted on selling it, and the other firmly refused to accept it. They pushed back and forth, causing a commotion to the commune. Finally, the commune had to adopt a compromise method: the grain station purchased 400 *jin*, and the remaining 600 *jin* were pulled back to the production team for storage.
    In the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan, who knows how many production teams like the "Rotten Fifth Team" and the "Poor Fifth Team" there are! In many places, the poor and lower-middle peasants, after "turning over," happily pushed carts, carried bags, and even wrapped grain in clothes, towels, and even newly woven cloth, and went to sell surplus grain in groups. They proudly said that they were selling "glorious grain," "patriotic grain," and "revolutionary grain." As soon as the commune members heard that they were going to dry surplus grain and public grain, they would immediately take out their own bed sheets, mats, and even newly woven cloth to spread out the grain.
    "Even if I carry a small bag of grain and sit in the grain station, it counts as expressing my heart to support the country!" - This is the intention of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan.
    "Having food to eat, having things to look at (reserves) is not enough; we must also contribute to the country!" - This is the voice of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan.
    Dear readers, when your family is sitting around the table eating, have you ever thought that your bowl may contain a grain of grain that the people in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan have worked hard for a year to seize from the low-lying nests, sand nests, and alkaline nests? Did you know how lofty the revolutionary feelings of the people in the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan were when they were struggling so hard, "to add to the state's granary"?

    During our visit to the disaster area of ​​eastern Henan, we passed through six counties: Kaifeng, Qi County, Ju County, Ningling, Minquan, and Lankao, traveling more than 1,000 *li*. We passed through the newly planted forest belt on the old Yellow River course, a row of willow bushes on the Yellow River embankment, the bustling river construction site, and the terraced fields and strip fields in the saline-alkali area. The people we visited were only a few of the countless heroic figures in eastern Henan; everything we saw and heard was only a few waves in the surging revolutionary tide in eastern Henan. However, all of this has told us that the Party's policy of self-reliance, hard work, and striving for progress has been mastered by the people of eastern Henan and has become a huge material force, and the glory of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the land of eastern Henan.
    The day when the eight million people of eastern Henan drive away the three pests of waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinity from the eastern Henan Plain like sending away the God of Plague is not far away! ·Our reporter·

    劲草迎风
    ——记豫东除“三害”斗争中的几个英雄人物
    编者按：近几年来，在我们党的正确领导下，豫东人民进行了改天换地的艰巨斗争。对自然灾害的斗争，象其他革命事业一样，是广大群众自己的事情。豫东地区的抗灾斗争，就是由焦裕禄这样的优秀党的干部，领导千千万万群众英雄干出来的。在这里，我们向读者介绍几个英雄人物。
    时势造英雄。在毛泽东时代，指导我们行动的是毛泽东思想。掌握了毛泽东思想，就有了科学的世界观，有了坚定正确的方向；掌握了毛泽东思想，就有了大无畏的革命精神，有了认识事物发展规律的能力。一句话，掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，把自己锻炼成为智勇双全的无产阶级战士。这篇通讯里所介绍的一些英雄人物，他们跟焦裕禄同志的工作岗位不同，肩负的任务也不尽相同，由于他们用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，在对内涝、风沙和盐碱三害的斗争中，同样表现了大智大勇，取得了伟大的胜利。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”英雄的豫东人民说得好：如今俺们扛起毛泽东思想的大旗，内涝、风沙、盐碱这三个灾害，再不能随意作弄俺们了！
    常言说：疾风知劲草。在豫东抗击内涝、风沙、盐碱三害的艰苦斗争中，涌现了象兰考县前县委书记焦裕禄这样优秀的共产党员、优秀的群众领袖，也涌现了成千上万名在自然灾害面前昂首挺胸、巍然屹立的干部、共产党员和贫下中农。他们以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，同“三害”英勇搏斗，表现了坚强不屈的硬骨头精神。他们是力挽自然灾害狂澜的英雄。
    前不久，我们在豫东访问了这些英雄人物。
    那时，正是豫东平原上的严冬季节。整个豫东大地展现出一副气势磅礴的改造大自然的抗灾图：沿着沟河渠道，人群喊着号子，在疏浚河道；黄河故道的沙原上，人们忙着造林带，堵风口，锁沙龙；东西三百多里长的黄河“浸润带”上，人们起早贪黑，赶筑抗碱、防碱的农田，在给盐碱窝换新装。……
    豫东人们说：内涝、风沙、盐碱这三个妖魔鬼怪，再不能随意作弄俺们了。如今俺扛着毛泽东思想的大旗，俺们要靠自己的双手管住大自然，创造一个社会主义的新豫东！
    带着《毛泽东选集》抗灾的人
    豫东灾区，包括开封、商丘两个专区的十四个县。雎县河集公社有一个朱桥大队，在这个大队的二千二百亩耕地中，原来有一千六百亩都是碱地。那时人们说，这一带是“风吹白云起，六月遍地雪”，“夜里走路不用打灯笼”。自从成立高级合作社以来，这里年年闹碱、闹涝、闹旱。雎县县委和商丘地委年年派工作组去，发救济粮、救济款，也填不满这个“窟窿”。有人说：朱桥这地方，只能留着种树！有人说：朱桥的地，只能种田菁（一种耐碱、耐涝的豆科绿肥作物）！
    难道朱桥的水土真的不养人吗？难道朱桥这地方就不能闹革命吗？
    一九六四年十一月，县委又派了一个工作组去朱桥。一进村，大队干部就问：“这次来带了多少粮、多少钱？”工作组的同志说：“没带粮，也没带钱，只带了几本《大寨之路》。”大队干部一听，从鼻子里哼了哼说：“咱这老碱窝，学的啥大寨哟！”
    隔了几天，县长张宏远接着也去了。大队干部又围上去：“县长，给俺带了多少粮，多少钱？”张宏远拿出《毛泽东选集》说：“啥也没带，就是给你们带来了这个本本！”
    第二天，张宏远召开社员大会，对社员大讲愚公移山的雄心壮志，大讲大寨自力更生、改天换地的故事，并表示决心跟大家一起改造这里的老碱窝。讲完，他撂下棉袄，领着社员下地拉犁去了。当场有社员感动得噙着眼泪说：旧社会见官三分灾，如今五十多岁的县长来跟咱一块拉犁，咱还能躺着不干？
    这以后，再组织社员学大寨，就学得进了。贫农朱怀勋说：吃了八年统销粮，咱大队没有吃富一家，有些人越救济越懒。说来说去，还是咱没有志气！就在这年冬天，有七十多户贫下中农要求国家减少对他们的救济，他们还把已经送到村的七千多斤救济粮，二百多元贷款，让给了困难更大的队。
    改造盐碱地的斗争开始了。朱桥西南有十八亩老碱地，据说六十来年没长过庄稼。第三生产队的共产党员们，把这十八亩地剥了一层皮，挖走表层的碱土，把它甩进深沟，再在上面铺一层好土，种上棉花。许多人的双肩磨肿了，却换来了一片茂堂堂的棉苗。秋后，这十八亩棉花第一次收了五百多斤皮棉。第六生产队的社员把五个老坑塘的黑淤泥挖光了，在十二亩老碱地上平铺了半尺厚。种上谷子，亩产四百多斤。
      “六月遍地雪”的朱桥盐碱窝里，一九六五年秋天开始出现了一片青绿。这年秋天，公社原来计划供应朱桥六万斤粮食，朱桥不仅没要，而且卖给国家六千多斤余粮，大队还储备了五千斤。这一年，全大队买了大小牲口二十头，大中农具五十件，集体盖新房四十间。
    从此，朱桥这个老碱窝，变成一只金饭碗了。
    豫东一些县委的同志对我们说，有些老灾区，部分干部、群众对于抗灾斗争，思想上经历过一个大转变。前些年，他们还说，吃饭靠供给，花钱靠救济，治病靠免费，种地靠机器（拖拉机代耕）。但是，当他们读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话，拿起了党送给他们降妖除害的“自力更生”这个金箍棒时，情况就大变了。豫东灾区的干部和人民，从实践中深深体会到，自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，是党送给豫东人民的无价之宝，它比几万斤救济粮，几万元救济款，更要金贵几千倍，几万倍！
    新愚公敢降“三害”纸老虎
    如果把豫东“三害”比做老虎，那么，豫东八百万人民当中，就有许许多多“打虎英雄”。
    民权县的土山寨，是清朝黄河故道边上的一个村庄。旧废的黄河堤象一条沙龙，把它紧紧围困大半边。每年春秋天，刮上个四五级风，村子里天昏地暗，活象罩了一层混浊的黄色尘雾。人们蒸馍，揭开笼盖，馍上一层沙；端碗喝汤，汤上一层黄土。七八级风一刮，更是厉害。它呼啸着，把庄稼连根拔走，平地能被揭掉几寸厚一层皮。卷起的沙砾，有时能填井掘墓，掩埋村舍。土山寨北边几里路，有一个大侯集，原是个三百多户人家的镇店，由于封建统治阶级的残酷压榨、剥削和风打沙埋，解放前只剩了几户人家。一九六二年，一场大风平了土山寨七眼井。那年，有一百五十亩地从春天种高粱到秋天耩麦子，种一次，被风沙打死一次；再种，又被打死；一连种了七茬，才算坐了三分苗，一百五十亩地只收了七十二斤麦子。
    有些社员灰心丧气地说：“咱土山寨迟早要成大侯集！要治住沙，除非男人死光，女人嫁完。”“沙呀沙，你害得俺娶不上媳妇，连儿子孙子都给俺吹跑了。”
    大队党支部书记赵鸿钧心里琢磨的却是毛主席所教导的《愚公移山》精神。风沙这座山，压在土山寨人头上不知多少年月了，赵鸿钧寻思要搬掉这座山。
    大风天，他披着麻包片，顶着风沙，从这儿走到那儿，不时地蹲蹲、看看。有一次，他趴在地上观察平地流沙象流水一样奔泻着，发出唰唰的响声。不一会儿，他背后积起了一个小小的沙古堆。——治沙的“药捻”找到了。他惊喜地跳了起来。
      “先挖沟、打墙，殡沙、挡沙；再造林，治沙。”
    大队党支部订了一个挖防沙沟、打防沙墙的计划。共产党员们学习讨论了《愚公移山》。
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话象明灯，照亮了土山寨共产党员们前进的道路；象号角，鼓起了土山寨共产党员们向风沙进军的战斗激情。
    他们说，“太行山、王屋山只不过挡住了愚公的去路；可咱们头上这座山，挡住咱吃，挡住咱喝，挡住咱穿，比太行山、王屋山可恶多啦。非搬掉它不可！”“风沙是只虎，咱有敬德的鞭！”
    赵鸿钧领着全村三十一个共产党员，摆开了打虎阵势。他们拿的“敬德鞭”，就是从毛主席的书上学来的愚公移山的精神。
    那时正是十冬腊月天，大雪纷扬。多数社员对挖沟打墙防沙还是将信将疑，三十一个共产党员却日夜坚守“阵地”。他们刨开尺把厚的冻土，挖沟垒墙。这是土山寨征服风沙的一场“淮海战役”。这一仗打赢了，他们就能在沙丘上立定脚跟；打不赢，真要变成大侯集了。他们喊着：“挖呀，一锨沙就是一锨粮！”“从老虎嘴里夺馍呀！”
    挖沟打墙工程搞得正紧时，突然起了西北风。风沙过后，社员们都跑到地里去看。原来已经挖沟打墙的地方，飞沙被殡在沟里，挡在墙脚，麦苗仍然青生生的；那些还没有来得及挖沟打墙的地方，有一百来亩麦苗，有的被打死了，有的被活埋了。
    一场风大开人们的眼界，坏事变成了好事。社员们也纷纷扛起铁锨，跟在三十一个共产党员后面挖沟打墙去了。这一个冬春，土山寨人用了四十二天时间，挖了七十二条防沙沟，长达七十四里，打了七十二道防沙墙。沟和墙保住几十亩麦子有了薄收，多年没吃过麦子的土山寨人吃上了白面条。
    挖沟打墙毕竟只是治标的办法，治本的办法还是造林。站定脚跟以后，土山寨党支部接着在一九六三年春天领导群众造林。造林，没有树苗，怎么办？发动党员兑树苗，坚决不向国家伸手。有的人拿钱去买，有的人走亲戚去借。有的人卖了鸡蛋，买来柳椽子栽。党员、干部的行动，带动了社员群众。这年春天，他们在废黄河堤上栽了七万多棵树苗，以后又陆续栽了三十来万棵。
    毛主席的书给了土山寨人以万钧之力，他们用“敬德鞭”把“风沙虎”初步降伏了。从一九六四年以后，这里再没有发生过庄稼苗被风沙打死、活埋的灾害。一连吃了七年统销粮的土山寨，一九六五年摘掉了缺粮户的帽子，向国家交售了四万五千多斤余粮，大队还储备了四万多斤。
    象土山寨人这样的移山愚公，在豫东的老洼窝里，老碱窝里，在许多地方都有。愚公移山的精神武装了豫东人民敢于向“三害”斗，而在同“三害”斗争的过程中，成千上万名社会主义时代的新愚公成长起来了。
    “就让俺给国家添添仓吧”
    豫东灾区有越来越多的生产大队、生产队，一年甚至一季之内翻了身，可以自给，不再向国家要救济了。这是豫东历史上值得大书特书的事。但是，如果因此认为豫东灾区人民除“三害”的斗争，单是为了自己，那就错了。他们心里装的是三个大字：为革命。
    豫东黄河大堤以南和陇海路两侧，有一条狭长的黄河浸润地带，这里是盐碱灾害最重的地方。黄河浸润带有四里宽，三百多里长。它的东头——民权县孙六口公社，有一个出名的穷队，因为穷，人们都叫它“烂五队”。
    一九六四年秋天，“烂五队”夺得了多少年来的第一个好年成，变成了自给队。社员们满心欢喜，拉着架子车，装了三百八十斤大豆，到粮站去卖余粮。收粮人一看，豆子太潮，没问他们是哪个队的，就叫他们回去晒干再卖。社员们第二次拉着架子车去粮站，谁知粮站又没有收。原来粮站一查问，知道他们是多年吃统销粮的“五保队”，叫他们又拉了回去。但是，“烂五队”的社员们哪里甘心，第三次又把三百八十斤大豆拉到粮站。他们对粮站的干部说：“俺吃了多少年统销粮，一碗端十来个省的粮食；今年也该拿俺的粮食，跟全国的粮食掺合掺合啦。就让俺给国家添添仓吧。”粮站的干部感动极了，收下了。一九六五年秋天，“烂五队”又向国家卖了四千来斤余粮。
    三百八十斤也好，四千斤也好，“礼轻情义重呵！”这哪里是交粮食，交的分明是一颗颗灾区贫下中农的心！“烂五队”的社员们为了向国家仓库里添这些粮食，他们在老碱窝里进行了多么不屈的斗争呵！
      “烂五队”的队长、共产党员吕兴鹏，是一九六三年夏天被社员们选出来的。“烂五队”是吕兴鹏的家乡。他经过三次申请，放弃了公社会计的职务，放弃了薪金，回到“烂五队”。他说：“共产党员应该到最困难的地方去。我不能眼看生产队光靠国家养，不出一点贡献。”
    吕兴鹏刚当队长的时候，“烂五队”穷得叮当响。他跟贫下中农滚在一个铺上睡觉，对他们讲自力更生的道理。他和副队长听鸡叫三遍就起来往地里拉粪。他和青壮年一块拉耧种麦。他同生产队的会计、保管一起为队上拉脚，来回重载，路上啃着窝窝头。他领导社员翻土压碱，修筑条田，在插花碱地里一棵一棵地管理庄稼苗。……
      “烂五队”终于在吕兴鹏和贫下中农手里翻过身来了。他们只用一年多时间，就实现了自己的理想：不靠国家供养，对国家要有贡献。
    离“烂五队”几十里路的地方，宁陵县孔集公社有一个“穷五队”，也有一段卖“革命粮”的佳话。
      “穷五队”也在黄河浸润带上，田野是一片白花花的盐碱。过去，全队社员的吃穿花销，基本上由国家包。一九六三年起，生产队长曹玉江领导社员采取综合办法治碱。一九六四年麦季，头一次有了余粮。麦收以后，曹玉江带着十几个社员，拉的拉，扛的扛，喜气洋洋地把一千斤小麦送到了购粮站。粮站的干部认识他们是“穷五队”来的，就说：“同志们，第一年翻身，还是拉回生产队，留着垫垫仓底吧！”社员们说：“不中，不中。俺吃了多少年统销粮啦，今年党领导俺翻了身，有了余粮，一定要卖。”一个一定要卖，一个坚决不收，推来让去，闹到公社，最后公社只好采取折衷的办法：粮站收购四百斤，其余六百斤由生产队拉回去储备起来。
    在豫东灾区，谁知道有多少象“烂五队”和“穷五队”这样的生产队！许多地方的贫下中农，“翻身”后欢天喜地地推着车子，扛着袋子，甚至用衣服、手巾包着粮食，成群结队去卖余粮。他们自豪地说卖的是“光荣粮”、“爱国粮”、“革命粮”。社员们只要一听说要晒余粮、公粮，就会立刻拿出自己家里的被单、席子、甚至新织的布，摊晒粮食。
      “哪怕提一小兜粮食，到粮站坐一坐，也算表了表俺支援国家的心里！”——这就是豫东灾区千百万贫下中农的心意。
      “有吃的，有看的（储备），还不行；还得对国家有贡献！”——这就是豫东灾区千百万贫下中农的声音。
      亲爱的读者们，当你一家人围桌吃饭的时候，你可曾想过，饭碗里可能盛有豫东灾区人民辛苦一年从洼窝里、沙窝里、碱窝里夺来的一粒粮？你可曾知道，豫东灾区人民在千辛万苦的斗争中，怀着多么崇高的“要为国家添仓”的革命情怀？
