    Overcoming Complacency
    Using Jiao Yulu as a mirror, and conducting a self-examination, I feel the biggest gap is that I haven't studied and applied Chairman Mao's works as flexibly as he did, especially in not putting enough effort into transforming my subjective world.
    Our situation in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works lags behind the needs of the situation. The main reason is that the leading cadres have a sense of pride and complacency, always thinking that the various tasks in Gaoyao County have been done well in the past two years. Therefore, we have not demanded higher standards of ourselves in our work, and our learning is not humble.
    In fact, our work is not done well in all aspects. For example, in the county's more than 600,000 mu of cultivated land, about 30 percent is still frequently subjected to drought and flood disasters, and hundreds of thousands of mu of mountain land have not been afforested. These all require the county party committee to actively lead the masses to solve. Chairman Mao often taught us: Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind. I have forgotten this teaching. The root cause of this kind of thinking is that we have not armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought like Jiao Yulu. In the future, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works and be a revolutionary cadre like Jiao Yulu.

    克服自满
    我以焦裕禄为镜子，对照检查，感觉最大的差距是没有象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，特别在改造主观世界上狠下功夫不够。
    我们活学活用毛主席著作的情况，落后于形势的需要。主要是领导干部思想存在着骄傲自满，总认为高要县两年多来各项工作都做得不错，因此，在工作中没有用更高的标准要求自己，学习也不虚心。
    其实，我们的工作，并不是在各方面都做好了。例如全县六十多万亩耕地面积，还有百分之三十左右经常遭受到旱、涝灾害，还有几十万亩山地没有绿化，这些都是需要县委积极去领导群众解决的。毛主席经常教导我们：虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。我就忘记了这个教导。存在这种思想，归根到底，就是我们没有象焦裕禄那样用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，今后一定要努力学习毛主席著作，做焦裕禄式的革命干部。
