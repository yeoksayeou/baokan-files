    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd—After a lengthy and fierce debate and melee, both houses of the US Congress on the 1st passed a bill proposed by the Johnson administration to increase military spending for the war of aggression against Vietnam by $4.8 billion to procure military supplies.
    During the discussion of this bill in both the Senate and the House, the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam was attacked and questioned by many congressmen, who expressed concern about the government's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and opposed the government's pursuit of a risky policy of "gradual escalation." Although the bill was passed by a majority vote in both houses, many congressmen who voted in favor stated that this did not mean they supported the government's policy.
    In the Senate, Democrats Morse and Gruening voted against the bill, and in the House of Representatives, Democrats Brown and three others voted against it.
    Morse introduced an amendment to the bill advocating the repeal of the resolution passed by Congress in August 1964 during the Tonkin Gulf incident, authorizing the US President to use US armed forces arbitrarily in Indochina. Gruening introduced another amendment stipulating that the government shall not send newly drafted soldiers to South Vietnam without the approval of Congress. When proposing the amendment, Morse delivered a lengthy speech attacking the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the 1964 resolution and the military spending bill both led to the expansion of the war.
    Before the Senate vote, White House Press Secretary Moyers made a special statement on the matter, putting pressure on the senators. He said, "The President said in 1964 that as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, he has the inherent power to resist aggression in Southeast Asia," "He intends to fulfill...the resolution." Johnson also clamored in a speech on February 26 that even if Congress revoked this resolution, he "still has the right to fulfill our obligations there."
    Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright said he was not willingly voting in favor of the appropriations bill. He opposed the United States "throwing more and more personnel and money into an increasingly expanding war in Indochina with no end in sight." He was completely opposed to giving the government a blank check to arbitrarily act in Vietnam. Other congressmen stated that they voted in favor of the appropriations bill because if they did not, they would be accused of obstructing the delivery of supplies to the US military invading Vietnam.
    In the House of Representatives, seventy-seven Democratic congressmen jointly issued a statement, pointing out that they hoped that their vote would not be interpreted as "a mandate for unrestricted and indiscriminate expansion of military efforts." After the vote, the White House issued a statement in an attempt to appease the unease in Congress. The statement praised Congress's actions on the one hand, and on the other hand, said that it had noticed Congress's unease about the Vietnam War.

### 混战双方到底是一丘之貉  美国会通过增拨侵越军费法案  许多议员表示投赞成票并不等于支持扩大战争

    混战双方到底是一丘之貉
    美国会通过增拨侵越军费法案
    许多议员表示投赞成票并不等于支持扩大战争
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会两院在经过长时间激烈辩论和混战后，在一日通过了约翰逊政府提出的给侵越战争增拨四十八亿美元军费以供采购军用物资的法案。
    在参众两院讨论这个法案期间，约翰逊政府的侵越政策受到许多议员的攻击和质询，他们对政府扩大侵越战争表示担心，反对政府奉行冒险的“逐步升级”的政策。这个法案虽然在两院都以大多数票通过，但是许多投赞成票的议员表示，这并不是表示他们赞成政府的政策。
    在参议院中，民主党人莫尔斯和格里宁在表决时投了反对票，在众议院中，民主党人布朗等四人投了反对票。
    莫尔斯就这个法案提出了一项修正案，主张废除国会在一九六四年八月东京湾事件时通过的授权美国总统可以在印度支那任意使用美国武装部队的决议。格里宁提出了另一项修正案，规定不经国会通过，政府不得把征来的新兵派往南越。莫尔斯在提出修正案时发表了长篇演说，攻击约翰逊政府的侵越政策。他说，一九六四年的决议和军费法案都导向扩大战争。
    在参议院表决前，白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯专门就这件事发表谈话，对参议员施加压力。他说，“总统在一九六四年说过，他作为武装部队总司令，握有在东南亚抗拒侵略的固有权力”，“他打算履行……决议”。约翰逊在二月二十六日的一次谈话中也叫嚷，即使国会取消这一决议，他“仍然有权履行我们在那里的义务”。
    参议院外委会主席富布赖特说，他并非是心甘情愿地投票赞成拨款法案的。他反对美国“在印度支那一场越来越扩大、但看不到结局的战争中投下越来越多的人员和金钱”。他完全反对把允许在越南任意行动的空白支票给政府。另外一些议员表示，他们投票支持拨款法案，是因为如果他们不这样做，就会被指责为阻挠向侵越美军运送供应品。
    在众议院中，七十七名民主党众议员联名发表声明，指出他们希望不要把他们的投票解释为“一项可以不受限制地、不加区别地扩大军事努力的委托”。白宫在表决后发表声明，力图抚慰国会的不安情绪。这项声明一方面赞扬国会的行动，一方面又说注意到了国会对越南战争的不安。
