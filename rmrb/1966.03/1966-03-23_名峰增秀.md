    Famous Peaks Add Splendor
    Artwork by Feng Zhongtie
    This picture, "Famous Peaks Add Splendor," depicts the construction scene of a railway worksite. High mountains and precipitous cliffs, with towering peaks, have sparked an earth-shattering upsurge of socialist construction in the remote mountains and forests of our motherland.
    Comrade Feng Zhongtie excels at landscape woodcuts. Facing the magnificent and splendid nature, the author expresses his feelings and sings praises of the grandeur of our land. However, the author also depicts things even more magnificent and beautiful than the mountains and rivers. Workers are splitting mountains and cutting rocks, and tunneling through them. Trains loaded with equipment are winding their way into the deep mountains. New buildings are everywhere on the mountain peaks. The author painstakingly describes that there are footprints of builders everywhere between these thousands of mountains and peaks. The small tent in the picture, the rows of telephone poles, and the scaffolding built along the mountain can all be said to be a warm praise for the builders.
    In the lower part of the picture, the author prominently portrays a railway bridge about to be completed. The bridge piers stand tall and the situation is perilous. A huge crane is installing the bridge, and at the top, there is a worker waving a red flag. This scene is soul-stirring and typical. It illustrates the arduousness of the project and even more powerfully expresses the heroic spirit of the working class in transforming nature and conquering nature.
    The composition of "Famous Peaks Add Splendor" is very imposing, the carving is meticulous, and every detail is carefully handled. The handling of some details is thorough without being tedious, and it has a strong atmosphere of life. [Jiang Chi] (with picture)

    名峰增秀
    酆中铁作
    这幅《名峰增秀》画的是铁路工地的施工场面，高山峭壁，群峰耸立，在祖国的深山远林里掀起了惊天动地的社会主义建设高潮。
    酆中铁同志善作风景版画，面对雄伟壮丽的大自然，作者抒发了自己的感受，歌颂了河山的壮美。但是，作者也描绘了比山水更为壮丽、美好的事物。工人们劈山削石，凿穿隧道，满载器材的列车正迂回地进入了深山。山峰上处处是新的建筑，作者精雕细琢地描述了在这千山万峰之间到处有建设者的足迹。画中的一座小小的帐篷，一根根电线杆，以及那傍山搭起的脚手架，都可以说是对建设者的热情的礼赞。
    在画面的下部，作者突出地刻划了一座即将竣工的铁路桥梁。桥墩耸立，形势惊险，巨大的吊车正在安装着桥梁，顶头地方还有一位挥动红旗的工人。这个场面是动人心魄而又富有典型的。它说明了工程的艰巨，更有力地表现了工人阶级改造大自然，征服大自然的那种英雄气概。
    《名峰增秀》的构图很有气势，刀笔严谨，一丝不苟，一些细节的处理周密而不烦琐，具有强烈的生活气息。　〔江池〕（附图片）
