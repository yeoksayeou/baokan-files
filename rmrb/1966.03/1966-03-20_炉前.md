    At the Furnace Front
    Worker of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, Xing Kaishan
    Facing the steel sparks, firmly gripping the shovel handle,
    Flames rush towards me, sweat pours down;
    Hot spots, what are they!
    Thinking of the Daqing people,
    Building derricks in the desolate wilderness,
    Blizzards and sandstorms, they fear nothing;
    Living in "dry-built" earthen houses,
    With the whole world in their hearts!
    Relying on a revolutionary ambition and heroic spirit,
    Developing the treasures of the earth.
    Chairman Mao's works, are our guiding light;
    The Daqing spirit, takes root and sprouts in our hearts.
    Revolutionaries with ambition, especially love this fiery life.
    Raging flames, forge sets of steel bones;
    Able to hold up the sky if it collapses, unshakable in the face of giant waves!
    See us, firmly gripping the steel shovel handle,
    One shovel, two shovels, three shovels...
    Steel sparks burst forth.
    The furnace fire is like thousands of red flags,
    Fluttering in the wind,
    Smelting steel warriors of the era,
    Watching the changing international situation,
    Our working class's mind, can hold the whole world!

    炉前
    马鞍山钢铁公司工人  邢开山迎着钢花，紧握锹把，火焰扑面来，汗水滚滚下；热点，算个啥！想想大庆人，千里荒原竖井架，暴雪飞沙全不怕；身住“干打垒”的土屋，胸怀整个天下！凭一股革命的壮志豪气，把地底的宝藏开发。毛主席的著作，是我们的指路明灯；大庆精神，在我们心里生根发芽。有志气的革命者，专爱这火热生涯。熊熊烈焰，炼出一副副钢筋铁骨；天塌顶得住，巨浪冲不垮！看我们紧握钢锹把，一锹，两锹，三锹……钢花迸发。炉火象千面红旗，迎风呼啦啦，冶炼着时代的钢铁战士，注视着世界的风云变化，咱工人阶级的胸怀，装得了整个天下！
