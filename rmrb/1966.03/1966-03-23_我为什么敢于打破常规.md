    Why I Dare to Break Conventions
    In the past, I often thought: "Doctors need skills to treat diseases; good politics alone cannot cure diseases." However, countless facts have told me that this idea is one-sided. Emphasizing politics will make my work better.
    In August of last year, an accountant from Bole came to see me, suffering from traumatic cataract secondary to glaucoma. After the first operation, the patient's vision improved slightly. But not long after, pus accumulated in the anterior chamber (the area behind the black part of the eye). After repeated treatments, there was no improvement. According to conventional practice, if treatment still cannot eliminate the inflammation, the eyeball should be removed to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia from occurring in the other eye, leading to double blindness. Therefore, some doctors advocated following the routine, removing the eyeball, and believed that this fulfilled the doctor's responsibility and was beyond reproach.
    After hearing this news, the patient cried many times. Once, when I was inspecting the ward, the patient suddenly threw himself on me, pleading, "Dr. Batu'er, Dr. Batu'er, please think of a way, can you avoid removing my eye?" At this moment, I faced two attitudes: one was to follow the routine and remove the eyeball, but this would bring great pain to the patient; the other was to break the routine and try to preserve the patient's eye, but I would bear a great risk. When I thought that the patient was a commune accountant who had to do calculations every day, and how could he serve the people without eyes, class feelings motivated me. I resolved not to consider personal gains or losses and must find a way to preserve the patient's eye. I continued to experiment with various drugs. After many treatments, the patient's vision gradually recovered from blindness to 0.05 (able to see larger objects such as teacups and bowls within two meters), and corrected vision (i.e., with glasses) reached 0.3 (able to see objects of normal size). At this point, the patient shed tears of joy.
    This incident made me deeply realize that every person, no matter what line of work you are in, as long as you have the awareness of the proletariat, the feelings of the workers and peasants, and the thought of serving the people, and you emphasize politics, you will generate infinite wisdom and strength, dare to overcome all kinds of difficulties, and do a good job in your professional work. If a person only considers personal gains and losses, even if he has certain professional knowledge, it is only a means to seek personal fame and gain. Especially when encountering difficulties in work, he will shrink back. In this way, the work will definitely not be done well.

    我为什么敢于打破常规
    以前，我常想：“当大夫的，有了技术才能治病，政治上再好也治不了病。”可是，无数事实告诉我，这种想法是片面的。突出政治，会使自己的工作做得更好。
    去年八月间，从博乐来了一位公社会计，患外伤性白内障继发青光眼症。经过第一次手术，病人视力稍有增加。可是过了不久，患眼前房（黑眼珠后面部位）积脓，经过反复治疗，不见好转。按照惯例，如果医治仍不能消除炎症，为防止另一只眼睛发生交感性眼炎，导致双目失明，应为病人摘除眼球。因此，有的大夫就主张按常规办事，摘掉眼球，并且认为这就尽到了大夫的职责，是无可非议的。
    病人知道这个消息后，痛哭了很多次。一次我查病房时，病人一下子扑在我身上，恳求地说：“巴大夫，巴大夫，想想办法，不摘除我的眼睛行不行？”这时，在我面前有两种态度：一是按常规办事，摘除眼球，但是这会给病人带来很大的痛苦；一是打破常规，设法为病人保留眼睛，可是自己要担很大的风险。当我想到病人是个公社会计，每天要算账，没有眼睛怎么为人民服务的时候，阶级感情激励着我，就决心不考虑个人得失，一定要设法为病人保留眼睛。我继续用各种药物进行实验治疗。经过多次医治，病人的视力逐渐由失明恢复到零点零五（在两米内能看到较大的物体，如茶杯、碗筷等），矫正视力（即戴上眼镜）达到○点三（一般的大小物体均能看到）。这时，病人高兴得流出了眼泪。
    这件事使我深刻地认识到，每一个人不论你干那一行那一业，只要有了无产阶级的觉悟，有了工农群众的感情，有了为人民服务的思想，突出了政治，就会产生无穷的智慧和力量，敢于克服种种困难，把业务工作做好。如果一个人考虑的尽是个人的得失，即使有一定的业务知识，也只是谋取个人名利的一种手段，特别当工作上遇到困难时，就会畏缩不前。这样，工作肯定是做不好的。
