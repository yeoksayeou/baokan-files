    First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation to China, to convey to all the representatives and friends here the warmest regards from the people of South Vietnam. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the various people's organizations of China for holding this grand meeting in commemoration of the sixteenth anniversary of "March 19th," the Day of National Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism in Vietnam. We would like to express our gratitude to the foreign guests who have been invited to attend this meeting and convey to you, and through you, to the people of your countries, our friendly and militant solidarity regards from the people of South Vietnam.
    Comrades and friends:
    March 19, 1950, marks the beginning of the history of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist intervention and aggression. After the French expeditionary forces suffered a crushing defeat, U.S. imperialism openly interfered in Indochina, actively helping the French colonialists prolong and expand their war of aggression. U.S. military advisors, along with weapons, airplanes, and warships, were successively shipped from the United States to Saigon to aid the French colonialists. On March 18, 1950, they sent two U.S. warships to dock at the Saigon port wharf and deployed many aircraft carriers on the sea from Da Nang to Vung Tau, preparing to hold air force exercises right in Saigon-Cholon to flaunt their power in an attempt to threaten the fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people. This blatant act of intervention was immediately exposed and crushed by the South Vietnamese people. The people's armed forces used mortars to bombard the U.S. warships anchored in the Saigon city, which was still controlled by the enemy. Then, on the next day, March 19, 1950, led by lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho, the current Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, 500,000 people of Saigon-Cholon bravely took to the streets to demonstrate, shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" and "U.S. Imperialism, Get Out!" They tore down the U.S. flag and chased after U.S. sailors. That night, the U.S. warships hurriedly slipped away from Saigon port. Their plan to flaunt their power was finally thwarted. The heroic struggle of the people of Saigon-Cholon achieved a complete victory, promoting the heroic and indomitable fighting tradition of the Vietnamese nation, and opening a glorious chapter in the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. From that time on, "March 19" has become the Vietnamese people's "National Day of Struggle Against the U.S."
    Comrades and friends:
    U.S. imperialist aggression against South Vietnam has been a long-standing conspiracy. To realize this conspiracy, U.S. imperialism launched a cruel and bloody colonial war in South Vietnam. In this war of aggression, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have used all barbaric means, from medieval tortures and forms of killing to using scientific inventions that have always been strictly prohibited by international law as war weapons. The U.S. aggressors have used napalm bombs, white phosphorus bombs, highly incendiary bombs, chemical poisons, and poison gas on a wide scale to massacre the people of South Vietnam and destroy the crops and livestock of South Vietnam.
    In South Vietnam, according to incomplete statistics, in the past eleven years, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have killed 170,000 people; wounded and tortured to the point of disability 800,000 people; imprisoned 400,000 people in more than 1,000 prisons; burned down tens of thousands of houses; cut out livers, disemboweled, and buried alive more than 5,000 people; raped tens of thousands of women, including elderly women, young girls, and religious followers; and destroyed thousands of churches, temples, and so on.
    U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war have caused countless sufferings and extremely cruel deaths to the people of South Vietnam. No matter what name U.S. imperialism gives to the war it launched in South Vietnam, and no matter how it tries to deny and quibble, it cannot cover up the extremely barbaric nature of this unjust and dirty war of aggression.
    Comrades and friends:
    Faced with the U.S. imperialist schemes and actions of aggression, we, the South Vietnamese people, have no choice but to rise up, unite as one, take up arms, and resolutely defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, using revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence and using a patriotic war to oppose a war of aggression. Vietnam is a nation with thousands of years of history and a heroic and indomitable tradition of fighting against foreign aggression, which once defeated the French colonialist aggressors and wrote the magnificent chapter of Dien Bien Phu. Such a nation will never allow U.S. imperialism to turn half of its territory into its colony and military base.
    Under the correct leadership of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, people from all walks of life in South Vietnam have been waging a war of the entire people and a comprehensive war. In this great patriotic war, we have used a strong spirit of patriotism, an extraordinary spirit of courage, a spirit of solidarity, and a high degree of political consciousness, using simple weapons and weapons seized from the enemy, to resist U.S. imperialism, the most brutal and number one imperialist with huge war potential and material strength, and with all kinds of modern killing weapons. This is a people's war with rich forms of struggle, attacking the enemy politically and militarily, attacking the enemy with simple weapons and modern weapons, using the main forces, local forces, guerrillas, militia, and the masses with bare hands to attack the enemy together, using the power of people and the wisdom of people to attack the enemy, from the mountains and rural areas to the cities, attacking the enemy everywhere, causing the enemy to suffer defeats repeatedly and become increasingly deeply mired in the quagmire of South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese army and people are fighting more and more strongly and achieving greater and greater victories.
    From 1961 to the end of 1965, the South Vietnamese army and people annihilated 672,400 enemies, including 191,400 South Vietnamese puppet troops who deserted, surrendered to the people, and joined the people in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation; shot down, destroyed, and damaged 3,610 enemy aircraft of various types; destroyed, burned, and damaged 4,040 enemy military vehicles of various types; and sunk and destroyed 700 enemy ships of various types and 188 military trains.
    The current situation in South Vietnam is that the pillar of the U.S. imperialist and its lackeys’ rule – the “strategic hamlet” program – has been shattered by the South Vietnamese army and people. More than 80 percent of the "strategic hamlets" have been destroyed, causing the enemy's grassroots regime to collapse. The puppet army, the main reliance of U.S. imperialism’s special warfare, has suffered serious attrition and annihilation; at the same time, because their rear is shrinking and their sources of troops are drying up. As for the cities, they are no longer their safe rear areas. The people have risen up to wage powerful and continuous struggles against the enemy. The people's armed struggle teams in the cities have launched fierce battles against the enemy in Saigon and other cities, leaving the enemy in a terrible state.
    At present, four-fifths of the land in South Vietnam has been liberated. Ten million people are masters of their own affairs and live a free life in these vast liberated areas.
    Comrades and friends:
    In the face of increasingly heavy defeats, U.S. imperialism is trying every means to salvage the situation. Recently, the Johnson administration has stepped up sending more troops and shipping more weapons and war materials to South Vietnam to directly participate in the war of aggression against South Vietnam. At the same time, it has intensified the destructive war against the northern part of our motherland with its air force. At present, the U.S. troops in South Vietnam have reached more than 220,000. If we include the personnel of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which is constantly active in the coastal areas of Vietnam, as well as the mercenaries of Park Chung-hee, Australia, New Zealand, and others, the U.S. imperialist aggressor army in South Vietnam has reached nearly 300,000, which is equal to ten times the total number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam at the beginning of 1965. The U.S. expeditionary aggressor army has directly participated in military activities, conducting "sweeps," killing and setting fires, and committing many extremely barbaric crimes.
    On average, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys dispatch 20,000 sorties of aircraft every week, bombard and spread chemical poisons on villages 250 times a day, constantly dispatch B52-type aircraft to bomb densely populated areas, and implement its so-called "large-scale destruction of villages" scheme in South Vietnam.
    Recently, U.S. imperialism, disregarding the indignation and severe condemnation of progressive world opinion, openly and continuously used chemical poisons and poison gas on a larger scale in South Vietnam, exposing its fascist and hideous features. Since November 1965, the U.S. military has spread chemical poisons and poison gas in many areas. It is especially serious in the provinces of Ben Tre, Can Tho, Ba Ria, Thu Dau Mot, Gia Dinh, Quang Nam, Di An, Kon Tum, Quang Tri, Long An, Vinh Long, Tra Vinh, Bien Hoa, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen. In Ben Tre Province, from December 7, 1965, to early January 1966, they spread chemical poisons and poison gas nearly 100 times in 50 communes, causing more than 46,000 people to be severely poisoned and destroying more than 4,000 hectares of crops and trees. U.S. bandits spread chemical agents four times in the suburbs of Can Tho City, poisoning 13,200 people. In Quang Ngai Province's Thach Tru; Bao Trai in Tan An-Di An; Cu Chi in Gia Dinh Province; Phuong Son and An Nhon in Binh Dinh Province, the U.S. aggressor army indiscriminately threw poison gas bombs and poison gas grenades at innocent civilians, and fired bullets with chemical poisons, sprayed poison gas into air-raid shelters, killing hundreds of innocent civilians, most of whom were women and children.
    Obviously, the U.S. aggressors have lost their humanity and exposed themselves as bloodthirsty executioners, even more vicious than the Hitler fascists.
    While carrying out an extremely brutal war in Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors and their South Vietnamese lackeys have also strengthened the war in Laos, continuously attacking and bombing the Laotian liberated areas; and constantly carrying out provocations and sabotage against the independence and neutrality of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
    While vigorously strengthening and expanding the war in Vietnam and Indochina, the U.S. authorities have constantly released clichés such as "peace talks" and "unconditional discussions," sparing no effort to promote their so-called "peace-seeking" plan. However, the crimes they have committed in South Vietnam, which are intolerable to heaven and earth, expose the essence of Johnson's so-called "peace-seeking" fraud. The Vietnamese people and the people of the world see through their deceptive schemes.
    The more U.S. imperialism sends more troops to South Vietnam, the more it dies, and the more disastrous the defeats it suffers. In recent months, the South Vietnamese army and people have dealt the U.S. imperialism and its lackeys a fatal blow. In the first two months of 1966 alone, 32,000 U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenaries were annihilated, including 16,000 U.S. troops and 3,500 Park Chung-hee mercenaries. The number of U.S. troops annihilated in the first two months of 1966 is equivalent to 80 percent of the total number of U.S. troops annihilated in the entire year of 1965. Five hundred U.S. aircraft were shot down, destroyed, and damaged. Recently, the enemy launched a five-pronged offensive in the southern part of central Vietnam and the central part of central Vietnam, conducting large-scale "sweeps" in an attempt to intimidate the people, eliminate the Liberation Armed Forces, and gradually occupy the liberated areas. However, they suffered a crushing defeat: 11,500 enemies were annihilated, including 9,000 U.S. troops, and nearly 300 U.S. aircraft, 75 M113 amphibious armored vehicles, 45 military vehicles, and 4 105mm howitzers were destroyed.
    While the South Vietnamese people are winning victories one after another, our flesh-and-blood compatriots in North Vietnam have been and are giving U.S. imperialism thunderous and lightning-like blows. The fact that more than 900 U.S. aircraft have been shot down over the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully demonstrates the invincible power of the North Vietnamese army and people, which has brought great encouragement to the South Vietnamese people.
    The heavy defeats suffered by U.S. imperialism in its war of aggression in South Vietnam over the past few years have not taught it a useful lesson. They still have not given up their ambition of aggression and are still stubbornly engaging in military adventures. Therefore, the only correct path to bring victory to the South Vietnamese people is still the path of decisive battle and decisive victory, defeating the enemy to realize their sacred aspirations of "independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and eventual reunification of the motherland." This is also the path to make a positive contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace in Indochina, Asia, and the world.
    Comrades and friends:
    The just struggle of the South Vietnamese people has received invaluable sympathy and support from the people of socialist countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving people in the world.
    The governments of many countries, various international democratic organizations, people's organizations of various countries, peace-loving and just forces in the world, as well as many prominent figures and many international conferences, have supported us. They approve and support the program of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation and recognize the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people. They have not only given us political and moral support, but also given us material assistance. Recently, the Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference adopted a resolution fully and completely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, regarding this struggle as an integral part of the struggle of the people of the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and neo-colonialism and old colonialism headed by U.S. imperialism, and regarding it as a shining example that inspires the people of the three continents.
    The conference decided to designate March 12 to 19, 1966, as "Week of Solidarity with the Vietnamese People."
    On this occasion, we express our warm welcome and gratitude to the people of all countries and all international organizations that have warmly supported our just struggle of the Vietnamese people in moral and material terms, especially to the people of all walks of life in the United States who have resolutely and courageously struggled against the U.S. government's policies of aggression and war in Vietnam.
    Comrades and friends:
    China and Vietnam are two neighboring countries that share mountains and rivers. The common destiny of life and death of our two countries has closely united us. From the beginning of our patriotic and just war, we, the South Vietnamese people, have received the most enthusiastic, resolute, powerful, and effective support and assistance from the Chinese people and government. At present, the high tide of the "Support Vietnam and Resist America" movement throughout China is a brilliant manifestation of the fact that 650 million Chinese people share weal and woe and are united in combat with the Vietnamese people. The South Vietnamese people are infinitely grateful and will always remember the statements of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Party, and state leaders in support of the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people. In his statement on August 29, 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong affirmed: "We, the Chinese people, firmly support the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people. I am deeply convinced that the South Vietnamese people will surely be able to achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland..." These words are the most concentrated expression of the Chinese people's wholehearted support for the Vietnamese people's resolute stance.
    We highly appreciate this enormous and invaluable sympathy and support from the Chinese people and government. It is precisely this enormous and valuable support, as well as the support of the people of other fraternal countries, that has brought us powerful encouragement and is one of the important factors that enable the South Vietnamese revolution to achieve a complete victory.
    Please allow us to once again express our deep and heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese government, and the people from the fighting and victorious South Vietnamese people.
    Comrades and friends:
    At present, in all parts of the world, wherever there is a shadow of U.S. imperialism, wherever there are U.S. military bases, and wherever there are U.S. weapons, peace and security are threatened, and there will be shootings, massacres, destruction, and subversion directly or indirectly caused by U.S. imperialism. Where there is no hot war provoked by them, there will be a cold war provoked by them. U.S. imperialism not only personally carries out wars of aggression and suppresses and enslaves the people of many countries, attempting to dominate the world; but also actively supports other colonial reactionary factions to obstruct the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    It is obvious that U.S. imperialism is the greatest destroyer of national liberation movements and world peace, and it is the main culprit of wars of aggression in the world today. It is the most ferocious enemy not only of the Vietnamese people but of all nations.
    The South Vietnamese people clearly recognize their glorious internationalist obligations. They are willing to stand forever with the people of all countries in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and challenges and for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.
    In response to the resolution of the Three Continents Conference, the South Vietnamese people are determined to further strengthen the anti-American war of national salvation movement in South Vietnam and contribute to defeating the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world – U.S. imperialism. The South Vietnamese people resolutely support the Laotian people's liberation struggle; support the Cambodian people's struggle to safeguard independence and neutrality; resolutely and vigorously support China's liberation of Taiwan; and will forever stand with the people of Venezuela, Congo (Kinshasa), Dominican Republic, Peru, and other countries, supporting their revolutionary cause of liberating their motherlands.
    Comrades and friends:
    In commemorating the sixteenth anniversary of "March 19," the Day of National Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism in Vietnam, looking back on the arduous and glorious journey of the past, the South Vietnamese people feel extremely happy and encouraged by the victories they have won and have seen the many difficulties that must be overcome to defeat the enemy.
    Highly promoting the historic and indomitable fighting tradition of "March 19," on the basis of the victories already achieved, the South Vietnamese people, relying on their people's war line and under the wise leadership of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, are determined to hold the guns in their hands tightly, fight to the end, and will surely achieve a brilliant victory.
    No matter how many more troops U.S. imperialism sends to South Vietnam, and no matter what strategies and tactics it adopts, and what weapons it uses, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam will definitely not be able to escape a shameful defeat.
    Long live the Vietnamese people's "March 19" National Day of Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism!
    Long live the unbreakable fighting unity and friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!
    Long live the fighting unity of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and old and neo-colonialism headed by the United States, and for the struggle for and consolidation of national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress!
    Vietnam will win!
    U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

### 南越人民决心紧握手中枪战斗到最后胜利  美帝国主义不管增兵多少都逃避不了可耻的失败  越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长黎松山的讲话

    南越人民决心紧握手中枪战斗到最后胜利
    美帝国主义不管增兵多少都逃避不了可耻的失败
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长黎松山的讲话
    首先，请允许我代表越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团，向各位代表和朋友们转达越南南方人民最热烈的敬意。我们谨衷心地感谢中国各人民团体为纪念“三·一九”越南全国人民反美斗争日十六周年而举行这个隆重的大会。我们谨向应邀出席这个大会的各位外宾表示谢意，谨向你们，并通过你们，向你们本国人民，转达我们越南南方人民友谊的和团结战斗的敬意。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    一九五○年三月十九日，是越南人民反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的斗争史篇的开首。在法国远征军遭到惨重失败的情况下，美帝国主义公然对印度支那进行干涉，积极帮助法国殖民主义者延长和扩大其侵略战争。美国军事顾问连同武器、飞机、军舰陆续地从美国运进西贡来帮助法国殖民主义者。一九五○年三月十八日，它们派了两艘美国军舰在西贡港码头靠岸，从岘港到头顿的海面上部署了许多航空母舰，准备举行空军演习，就在西贡—堤岸市中来炫耀它们的力量，企图威胁越南南方人民的斗志。它们这种明目张胆的干涉行为，立即被越南南方人民所揭露和粉碎。人民的武装力量用迫击炮轰击停泊在尚被敌人控制的西贡市的美国军舰。接着在第二天，即一九五○年三月十九日以现任越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿律师率领的五十万西贡—堤岸市人民勇敢地冲上街头进行示威游行，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义滚回去！”等口号，他们扯下美国国旗，追击美国水兵。当天晚上，美国军舰就赶紧偷偷地从西贡港溜走。它们企图炫耀力量的计划终于被挫败了。西贡—堤岸市人民的英勇斗争取得了完全的胜利，它发扬了越南民族英勇不屈的斗争传统，打开了越南人民反对美帝国主义斗争的光荣史篇。从那个时候起，“三·一九”就成为越南人民的“全国反美斗争日”。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    美帝国主义侵略越南南方的行为蓄谋已久。为了实现这个阴谋，美帝国主义就在越南南方发动了一场残酷、血腥的殖民主义战争。美帝国主义及其走狗在这场侵略战争中，不择一切野蛮手段，从中世纪的刑罚、杀人形式，到利用一向被国际公法所严禁的科学发明来作为战争手段。美国侵略者在广泛的范围内使用了凝固汽油弹、白磷弹、强烈燃烧弹、化学毒药和毒气等，来大批杀害越南南方人民和毁灭越南南方的庄稼和牲畜。
    在越南南方，十一年来，根据不完全的统计，美帝国主义及其走狗已经杀害了十七万人；打伤和拷打以至残废的八十万人；在一千多所监狱里，监禁着四十万人；烧毁了成十万所民房；挖肝、剖腹、活埋了五千多人；强奸了成万名妇女，其中包括老年妇女和幼女以及宗教徒；捣毁了成千所教堂、庙宇等等。
    美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，给越南南方人民造成了数不尽的痛苦和极其残酷的死亡。美帝国主义不管给它在越南南方所发动的战争加以什么名义，也不管怎样抵赖狡辩，也都掩盖不了这场非正义和肮脏的侵略战争的极其野蛮的性质。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    面临着美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和侵略行动，我们越南南方人民只有揭竿而起，万众一心地团结在一起，拿起武器，坚决打败美国侵略者及其走狗，用革命的暴力来反抗反革命的暴力，用爱国战争来反对侵略战争。越南是一个有着成千年历史的民族，它有着反对外国侵略的英勇不屈的斗争传统，曾经战胜法国殖民主义侵略者，写下了奠边府的壮烈史篇，这样的一个民族决不允许美帝国主义把自己的半壁江山变成它的殖民地和军事基地。
    在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，越南南方各阶层人民进行了一场全民和全面的战争。在这场伟大的爱国战争中，我们用强烈的爱国主义精神、非凡的勇敢精神，用团结一致的精神和高度的政治觉悟，用简单的武器和从敌人手中缴获来的武器，抗击美帝国主义这个有着巨大的战争潜力和物质力量，有着一切现代化杀人武器的最残暴的头号帝国主义。这就是具有丰富的对敌斗争形式的人民战争，就是从政治上和军事上打击敌人，用简单武器和现代化武器来打击敌人，用主力部队、地方部队、游击队、民兵以及赤手空拳的群众一齐来打击敌人，用人的力量和人的智谋来打击敌人，从山区、农村、一直到城市，在一切地方打击敌人，使敌人节节失败，日益深陷于越南南方的泥潭之中。越南南方军民越战越强，并且取得越来越大的胜利。
    自从一九六一年到一九六五年底，越南南方军民歼灭了六十七万二千四百名敌人，其中包括开小差、向人民投诚，同人民一起进行抗美救国斗争的十九万一千四百名南越伪军；击落、击毁、击伤各种类型的敌机三千六百一十架；击毁、烧毁和击伤各种类型的敌人军用车辆四千零四十辆；另外击沉、击毁敌人各种类型的舰艇七百艘和军用火车一百八十八列。
    当前越南南方的实际形势是：美帝国主义及其走狗统治制度的支柱——“战略村”计划，已经被越南南方军民所粉碎。百分之八十以上的“战略村”已经被捣毁，使得敌人的基层政权随之崩溃。伪军是美帝国主义特种战争的主要依靠力量，已经遭到严重的消耗和消灭；同时，由于它们的后方日益缩小，兵源也日益枯竭。至于城市，现在也已经不再是它们安全的后方了。人民群众已经纷纷起来同敌人进行强大和不断的斗争。城市里的人民武装斗争队伍曾经在西贡和其他城市里向敌人展开了激烈的战斗，打得敌人狼狈不堪。
    目前，越南南方五分之四的土地已经获得解放。一千万人民在这些广阔的解放区里当家作主，过着自由的生活。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    在日益惨重的失败情况下，美帝国主义正在千方百计地想办法来挽救败局。最近期间，约翰逊政府加紧向越南南方增派更多的军队和运进更多的武器和作战物资，直接参加侵略越南南方的战争。同时，用空军加强对我们祖国的北方进行破坏性的战争。目前，在越南南方的美军已经达到二十二万多名。如果把经常在越南沿海地区活动的美国第七舰队的兵员以及朴正熙、澳大利亚、新西兰等雇佣军也计算在内，那么，在越南南方的美帝国主义侵略军已经达到近三十万名，即等于一九六五年初在越南南方的美军总数的十倍。美国远征侵略军已经直接参与军事活动，进行“扫荡”，杀人放火，犯下了许多极其野蛮的罪行。
    美帝国主义及其走狗平均每星期出动飞机二万架次，每天用飞机向各村庄狂轰滥炸、撒放化学毒剂达二百五十次，不断派遣B52型飞机轰炸人口稠密的地区，在越南南方实行其所谓“大片毁灭村庄”的阴谋。
    最近，美帝国主义不顾世界进步舆论的愤慨和严厉谴责，明目张胆地连续在越南南方更大规模地使用化学毒药和毒气，使它的法西斯狰狞面目暴露无遗。自从一九六五年十一月以来，美军已经在许多地区撒放了化学毒药和毒气。尤其是在槟椥、芹苴、巴地、土龙木、嘉定、广南、堤岸、昆嵩、广治、龙安、永隆、茶荣、边和、广义、平定、富安等省更为严重。在槟椥省，从一九六五年十二月七日到一九六六年一月初，它们已经在五十个乡撒放了近一百次化学毒药和毒气，使四万六千多人严重中毒，四千多公顷的庄稼和树木被毁坏。美国强盗在芹苴市郊区撒放四次化学毒剂，使一万三千二百人中毒。美国侵略军在广义省的石柱；新安—堤岸的保寨；嘉定省的固芝；平定省的蓬山、安仁等地，向无辜平民乱扔毒气炸弹、毒气手榴弹，并且乱射带有化学毒药的子弹，用喷雾器向防空洞里喷射毒气，杀害成百名无辜平民，其中大多数是妇女和小孩。
    显然，美国侵略者已经丧失人性，暴露了它比希特勒法西斯更为凶恶的嗜血成性的刽子手真面目。
    在越南进行极其残暴的战争的同时，美国侵略者及其南越走狗还强化了在老挝的战争，向老挝解放区连续不断地进行袭击和轰炸；不断地对柬埔寨王国的独立和中立进行挑衅和破坏。
    美国当局在竭力强化和扩大越南和印度支那战争的同时，却又不断的放出什么“和平谈判”、“无条件讨论”等陈词滥调，不遗余力地为它的所谓“寻求和平”计划而奔走。然而，它们在越南南方所犯下的天地所不容的罪行，暴露了约翰逊所谓“寻求和平”骗局的实质。越南人民和世界人民看穿了它们的这种欺骗阴谋手段。
    美帝国主义愈是向越南南方增派更多的军队，死的也就更多，所遭受的失败只能更加惨重罢了。在最近几个月中，越南南方军民已经给予美帝国主义及其走狗以致命的打击。仅在一九六六年头两个月内，被歼灭的美军、仆从军以及伪军就达到三万二千名，其中美军一万六千名，朴正熙仆从军三千五百名。在一九六六年头两个月中被歼的美军人数，就相当于一九六五年全年被歼美军总数的百分之八十。被击落、击毁和击伤的美机达到五百架。最近，敌人在南部中区和中部中区发动五路攻势，进行大规模的“扫荡”，妄图恫吓人民，消灭解放武装力量，并逐步侵占解放区。可是，它们遭到了惨重的失败：一万一千五百名敌人被歼灭，其中包括九千名美军，近三百架美机、七十五辆M113两栖装甲车、四十五辆军用车和四门一○五毫米大炮被击毁。
    在越南南方人民节节胜利的同时，我们在越南北方的骨肉同胞，已经和正在给予美帝国主义以雷霆闪电般的回击。九百多架美机在越南民主共和国领土上被击落，这一事实充分地表明了越南北方军民所向无敌的力量，它给越南南方人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    美帝国主义几年来在越南南方进行侵略战争所遭到的惨重失败，并没有使它取得有益的教训。它们仍然没有放弃侵略的野心，依然顽固进行军事冒险。所以，给越南南方人民带来胜利的唯一正确的道路仍然是决战决胜、打败敌人的道路，以实现自己的“独立、民主、和平、中立、进而统一祖国”的神圣愿望。这也是为维护印度支那、亚洲和世界和平的事业作出积极贡献的道路。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南南方人民的正义斗争，曾经得到社会主义国家的人民、亚非拉各国人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民无比宝贵的同情和支持。
    许多国家的政府，各个国际民主组织，各国人民团体，世界上爱好和平和正义的力量，及许多著名人士和许多国际会议声援我们，他们赞成和支持越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表。他们不但给予我们以政治和道义上的支持，而且还给予我们以物质上的支援。最近，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议已经作出决议，完全和彻底支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争，把这个斗争看成是亚非拉美三大洲人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的组成部分，并把它看成是使三大洲人民欢欣鼓舞的一个光辉的榜样。
    会议决定从一九六六年三月十二日到十九日为“声援越南人民周”。
    借此机会我们对在道义上和物质上热情支持我们越南人民正义斗争的所有国家的人民和所有的国际组织表示热烈欢迎和感谢，尤其是对美国各阶层人民坚决和英勇地为反对美国政府在越南的侵略政策和战争政策而进行斗争，表示欢迎。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    中国和越南，是两个山连着山、水连着水的邻邦。我们两个国家生死存亡的共同命运，使我们互相紧密地团结在一起。我们的爱国正义战争一开始，我们越南南方人民就得到中国人民和政府最热情、最坚决、最有力和最有效的支持和援助。目前，遍及全中国的“援越抗美”运动高潮，就是六亿五千万中国人民同越南人民生死与共、战斗团结的光辉表现。越南南方人民无限感激并将永远记住毛泽东主席、中国党和国家领导人支持越南南方人民正义斗争的声明。毛泽东主席在一九六三年八月二十九日的声明中肯定地指出：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。我深信，越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献……”这些话，就是中国人民一心一意支持越南人民的坚决立场的最集中的表现。
    我们对于中国人民和政府的这种巨大和宝贵的同情和支持给予很高的评价。正是这种巨大和宝贵的支持以及其他兄弟国家人民的支持，给我们带来了强有力的鼓舞，也是使越南南方革命取得彻底胜利的重要因素之一。
    请允许我们再一次向毛泽东主席、兄弟的中国政府和人民表示我们正在进行战斗和取得胜利的越南南方人民的深切和衷心的谢意。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    目前，在全世界各地，那里有美帝国主义的影子，有美国军事基地，有美国武器，那里的和平和安全就遭到威胁，那里就要发生由美帝国主义直接或间接所引起的枪杀、残杀、破坏和颠覆活动，那里不发生由它们所挑起的热战，也会发生由它们所挑起的冷战。美帝国主义不但亲自进行侵略战争，对许多国家的人民进行镇压和奴役，妄图称霸全球；而且还积极支持其他殖民主义反动派来阻挠亚非拉美各国人民的民族解放运动。
    显而易见，美帝国主义就是民族解放运动和世界和平的最大破坏者，它就是今日世界上侵略战争的罪魁祸首。它不但是越南人民而且是一切民族的最凶恶的敌人。
    越南南方人民明确地认识到自己所肩负的光荣的国际主义义务，他们愿在反对美帝国主义的侵略和挑战，争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步的斗争中，永远同世界各国人民站在一起。
    为了响应三大洲会议的决议，越南南方人民坚决进一步加强在越南南方的抗战救国运动，为打败亚非拉美人民和世界人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义而作出贡献。越南南方人民坚决支持老挝人民的解放斗争；支持柬埔寨人民为维护独立和中立的斗争；坚决大力支持中国解放台湾；永远同委内瑞拉、刚果（利）、多米尼加、秘鲁等国人民站在一起，支持他们的解放祖国的革命事业。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    在纪念“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十六周年的时候，回顾过去艰苦而光荣的历程，越南南方人民为自己已经赢得的胜利而感到无比的欢欣鼓舞，并且看到了战胜敌人所必须克服的许多困难。
    高度发扬“三·一九”具有历史意义的不屈的斗争传统，在已经取得的胜利的基础上，越南南方人民依靠着自己的人民战争路线，在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，决心紧握手中枪，战斗到底，并且将一定取得辉煌的胜利。
    不管美帝国主义再向越南南方增派多少万军队，也不管它采用什么战略战术，使用什么武器，美帝国主义及其在南越的走狗都一定逃避不了可耻的失败。
    越南人民“三·一九”全国反美斗争日万岁！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的战斗团结和友谊万岁！
    亚非拉美各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和巩固民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步的战斗团结万岁！
    越南必胜！
    美帝必败！
