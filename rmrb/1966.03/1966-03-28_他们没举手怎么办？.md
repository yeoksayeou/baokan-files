    What to Do When They Don't Raise Their Hands?
    Tang Jiahou
    The members of the Huicheng Brigade of the Liulihe Commune in Fangshan County, Beijing, were holding a meeting to implement this year's production increase measures. Everyone was in high spirits, exerting all their strength to learn from the national agricultural model of Dazhai, and the scientific farming experience of the Nanhanji Brigade of the Zhoukoudian Commune, determined to surpass Nanhanji. Old poor peasant Zhao Cai took the lead and said, "We must learn good rational close planting. Last year we didn't catch up with Nanhanji, and suffered from sparse seedlings!" Before he finished, old poor peasants Meng Qinglin and Li Hongwen chimed in, "That's right, we have money to buy seeds, but no money to buy seedlings. They have twice as many seedlings per mu as we do, how can we surpass them!" Hearing their firm tone and remembering their stubborn opposition to close planting last year, everyone was extremely happy and applauded enthusiastically. The applause and laughter almost blew the roof off!
    What was going on? As it happened, at this time last year, they were also discussing learning Nanhanji's new experience of rational close planting. Just as Party Branch Secretary Huang Jichang arrived at the meeting of the first team, he heard Captain Gao Zhe say:
  "We want to learn Nanhanji's rational close planting, five seedlings per step, what do you think?" Many people answered loudly, "Okay!" A young man said, "We can't just say okay, we have to show revolutionary spirit. If you're a good example, raise your hand!" With a whoosh, a dark mass of hands went up, except for Zhao Cai who was in the corner smoking with his head down. The young men shouted, "Uncle Zhao, why don't you raise your hand?" He said impatiently, "Raising your hand won't grow corn! If you leave five seedlings per step, you can just wait to eat sweet corn!" The young men and the captain asked him, "Nanhanji can achieve high yields with that method, why would we eat sweet corn?" Zhao Cai said, "I haven't seen whether Nanhanji has high or low yields. I've been working since I was thirteen, and I've planted all kinds of crops. I won't believe it unless I see it with my own eyes." Gao Zhe couldn't hold back his anger and was about to criticize him for pouring cold water on everyone, but Huang Jichang stopped him. As the villagers were leaving, Gao Fuhai, the captain of the third team, rushed over angrily to report to Huang Jichang, "Li Hongwen in our team is going against me! Everyone agrees to five seedlings per step, but he says it's nonsense and doesn't agree." Before he finished, Meng Fanzhong, the captain of the second team, also arrived and said, "Meng Qinglin in our team didn't raise his hand. He said, 'I'll have to see before I decide.' It's really infuriating!"
    Huang Jichang saw that the captains' expressions were not right, so he asked them in return, "What do you think should be done?" The three captains became energetic. One said angrily, "Tomorrow, I'll give him a severe criticism!" Another simply said, "Let's just push these three stumbling blocks aside!" Huang Jichang thought: These three old poor peasants are usually very active and have given the team many good ideas. Now they are against close planting because they are afraid that if it's not done well, production will decrease, and the collective will suffer losses. It's not malicious. He shook his head and said, "You can't use these methods. Chairman Mao said, 'To convince people, you can only persuade, not coerce.' Changing people's thinking is like straightening a bent sapling, you can only slowly twist it in the direction of the bend. If you use force, you're sure to break it." The captains listened, their faces burning, but they were still unconvinced and said, "So, we shouldn't criticize backward thinking?" Huang Jichang said, "That depends on whether the criticism is correct. Uncle Zhao said he hasn't been to Nanhanji, so he doesn't believe close planting is so good. We shouldn't criticize him. We should first criticize our cadres. We are only a dozen miles away from Nanhanji, and the cadres often go to visit, but we haven't asked the villagers to go. Now, we want them all to raise their hands in agreement, how can we not hit a snag?"
  "Why did others raise their hands if they haven't been to Nanhanji either?" the captains still couldn't understand. Huang Jichang said, "I think the hand-raising in the first team was very different. Some raised their hands because they genuinely agreed, some raised their hands but were still hesitant in their hearts, and some were just bandwagoning. We can't just look at the surface." These words left the three captains looking at each other, speechless.
    The next day, Huang Jichang went to visit the three old poor peasants' homes one by one. But he didn't mention the matter of the previous night at all, only asked them for their opinions on spring plowing and production. The three old poor peasants who were waiting to be "criticized" were quite puzzled; the three captains who were still angry said, "I don't know what Secretary Huang is up to!"
    When it was time to hoe the fields, a storm broke out in the first team. They had two fields that were about a hundred mu each. Yan Fengzhi and a few young people, as requested by the captain, plowed the field called "San Qing Er" into narrow ridges of one chi and two cun, preparing to learn Nanhanji's close planting; Zhao Cai and a few old men, according to the old rules, plowed the field called "Xihulu Tou" into wide ridges of one chi and eight cun. Gao Zhe angrily wanted them to redo the work, but Huang Jichang wouldn't allow it, and instead said jokingly, "Good! Let everyone watch a show of 'competing platforms,' and open their eyes."
    When it was time to thin the seedlings, the captains wanted to hold a meeting of commune members to discuss, but Huang Jichang ordered each team to hitch up large carts and take the commune members to visit Nanhanji. As soon as everyone arrived at the edge of Nanhanji's field, they exclaimed in admiration: "Look! They've already thinned the seedlings, how neat and strong they are, like a mat." The three old poor peasants were, after all, experienced farmers, and they plunged into the crops as soon as they got out of the car. Huang Jichang followed behind them, and saw Li Hongwen secretly taking out a ruler hidden on his body, measuring left and right, and it was indeed five seedlings per step! Zhao Cai, with his hands behind his back, walked from one end of the field to the other, and then back from the other end, and it was also five seedlings per step! Meng Qinglin calculated back and forth with his fingers, and it was still five seedlings per step! Huang Jichang watched in his eyes and kept it in his heart, and tried to ask them, "Is it okay for us to leave the seedlings like this too?" Meng Qinglin said, "If you leave them so densely, without real skill, you won't get much grain!" Huang Jichang said, "That's right! We have to put in real skill!" But Li Hongwen continued, "If you are willing to put in real skill, three seedlings per step will yield no less grain than here." Zhao Cai was still very confident and said, "Let's compare the corn in the fall and see whose is bigger!"
    The captains and young people originally thought that there was hope this time, but they didn't expect that the "door" of thought was so difficult to open, and their anger rose again. Huang Jichang frowned and said seriously, "We must not forget Chairman Mao's words. Old people are deeply influenced by the old, have many old frameworks, and are slow to accept new things. We must let them see more, listen more, and gradually their thinking will open up. Now they haven't figured it out, and it's because our work hasn't been done well enough."
    In September, the corn tassels dried and turned red, and it was almost harvest time. One day, Huang Jichang led the three old poor peasants to visit Nanhanji again. The three of them thought on the way that Nanhanji was a famous "drought highland," and there hadn't been a thorough rain this year, so the densely planted seedlings wouldn't be better than their intercropped crops. But when they took a look at Nanhanji, good heavens! The corn in their fields was indeed better than their intercropped corn. The corn stalks grew as tall as houses, and there wasn't a single yellow leaf from top to bottom. Each plant had two large ears of corn, so heavy that they were leaning over. They stepped it off, four thousand plants per mu, with no missing seedlings and no broken rows. Comparing it with the hundred mu of wide ridges they planted themselves, with at most two thousand two hundred plants per mu, they were somewhat convinced. Zhao Cai couldn't help but say, "Nanhanji is really planting one mu as if it were two mu, and we can only match six-tenths of it!" He also asked the commune members working in the field, "How much fertilizer did you use?" "How many cartloads of compost did you apply?" "How many times did you water it?" "..." He didn't stop, from early morning until the sun set, and it was only after Huang Jichang urged them several times that they reluctantly returned.
    In the past, when they returned from visits, they were like old ladies eating broad beans - their mouths were shut tight, and if Huang Jichang didn't ask, no one would say anything. This time it was the other way around. Huang Jichang was happy in his heart but didn't say it, but they couldn't hold back and said to him, "Jichang, we have to hold a good meeting when we get back." "What for?" he asked knowingly. They said, "We have to tell everyone that even though our corn looks strong, it's far behind Nanhanji. We have to hurry up and top-dress and water it to strengthen the grains and maybe increase production a bit." Huang Jichang said happily, "Okay!" When they returned to the village, they held a meeting, mobilized the masses, watered the fields once, and top-dressed with fertilizer once.
    At harvest time, the narrow-row, close-planted corn of the first team's youth yielded more than seven hundred jin per mu, catching up with the average per-mu yield of Nanhanji; the wide-row, sparsely-planted corn of the old men yielded only five hundred jin per mu. They were even more convinced. Zhao Cai said, "I am now convinced that rational close planting is good!" Li Hongwen said, "I've figured it out! Now that we have collectivization, electric wells, machines, and chemical fertilizers, the old methods of individual farming don't work anymore. We have to talk about scientific farming." Meng Qinglin said with emotion, "We've been farming all our lives, and now we still have to learn how to farm. We really have to live and learn!" From then on, they all became active participants in scientific experiments, and Zhao Cai was even elected as the leader of the technical team for the entire brigade.
    The three captains and the young people were also convinced, and they said to Branch Secretary Huang Jichang, "Listening to Chairman Mao's words is correct. Chairman Mao's words are like a golden key that can open any lock!" (Attached image)

    他们没举手怎么办？
    汤家厚
    北京房山县琉璃河公社洄城大队的社员们正在开会，落实今年的增产措施。大伙儿心气挺高，铆足了劲，要学全国大寨式的农业典型，周口店公社南韩继大队科学种田的经验，决心超过南韩继。老贫农赵才抢在头里说：“咱们一定得学好合理密植。头年没赶上南韩继，就是吃了苗稀的亏！”他没说完，老贫农孟庆林、李宏文都搭腔了：“对，有钱买种，没钱买苗。人家一亩地比咱的苗多一倍，咱还怎么超人家呀！”听他们三人这坚决的口气，想起头年他们反对密植的那股倔劲儿，大伙儿别提有多高兴了，都一个劲地鼓掌。掌声、笑声，把屋顶都要震飞了！
    这是怎么回事呢？说来也巧，头年这个时候，也是讨论学南韩继合理密植的新经验。党支部书记黄继长刚来到一队会场，就听队长高哲说：
  “咱们要学南韩继的合理密植，一步五棵苗，大伙看行不行？”许多人都响亮地回答说：“行！”有个小伙子说：“不能光说行，得拿出革命干劲来。是好样儿的就举手！”呼啦一下，黑压压一大片，就是赵才在旮旯里低着头抽烟。小伙子们直嚷嚷：“赵大爷，您为啥不举手？”他没好气地说：“举手也长不了棒子！你们要一步留五棵苗，就等着吃甜棒吧！”小伙子们和队长都问他：“南韩继那么种能高产，为什么咱们就得吃甜棒呀？”赵才说：“南韩继高产低产我没见。我打十三岁扛活，什么庄稼都种过，没亲眼见，我不信。”高哲挂不住火了，正要批评他是给大伙泼冷水，黄继长给拦住了。社员刚出门，三队队长高福海就气呼呼地跑来，向黄继长汇报说：“咱队李宏文跟我干上啦！大伙都同意一步五棵苗，就他说是瞎胡闹，不同意。”他刚说完，二队队长孟凡忠也赶来说：“咱队孟庆林没举手。他说：‘我得看看再说。’真气人！”
    黄继长看队长们的神气都不对劲儿，就反问他们：“你们说该怎么办？”三个队长劲儿都来了。一个气呼呼地说：“明儿，我狠批评他一顿！”一个干脆说：“把他三个绊脚石，扒拉一边去得了！”黄继长心想：三个老贫农平常都很积极，没少给队里出过好主意。眼下反对密植，也是怕闹不好，减了产，集体受损失，不是坏意。他摇摇头，说：“你们这些办法都使不得。毛主席说，‘要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。’改变人的思想，好比把一棵压弯的树苗育直，只能顺着劲儿慢慢拧，要是使猛劲硬拧，准得拧折了。”队长们听了，脸上火烧燎燥的，可是还不服气，说：“这么说，对落后思想就不该批评啦？”黄继长说：“那得看批评得对不对。赵大爷说他没去过南韩继，就不信密植那么好。这不该批评他，应该先批评咱们干部。咱们离南韩继十几里地，干部都常去参观，就是没叫社员去过，这会儿，还叫人家都举手赞成，怎么会不碰钉子？”
  “别人都没去过南韩继，为啥都举手呢？”队长们还有些想不通。黄继长说：“我看一队举手就很不一样，有的举手是真赞成，有的手举了，心里还嘀咕，还有的是望风使舵随大流，不能光看表面。”这一席话，说得三个队长你看我，我看你，没词儿了。
    第二天，黄继长挨个儿到三个老贫农家去串门儿。可是压根儿没提头天晚上的事，只向他们征求春耕生产的意见。三个等着“挨批评”的老贫农挺纳闷儿；三个还在生气的队长说：“不知道书记葫芦里装的什么药！”
    耠地的时候，一队闹了一场风波。他们有两块地都是百十来亩。严风志和几个小青年，按队长要求把叫三顷二的那块地耕成一尺二的窄垄，准备学南韩继的密植；赵才和几个老人，还是按老规矩，把西葫芦头那块地，耕成了一尺八的宽垄。高哲气冲冲地要他们返工，黄继长不让，反而逗乐似地说：“好！让大伙儿瞧一出对台戏，开开眼界。”
    棒子定苗的时候，队长们要开社员大会讨论，黄继长却叫各队都套上大车，拉着社员到南韩继去参观。大家一到南韩继地边就叫起好来：“瞧！人家都定苗了，多齐多壮啊，一领席似的。”三个老贫农到底是庄稼把式，一下车就扎到庄稼里去了。黄继长跟在他们后边，只见李宏文偷偷地掏出藏在身上的尺，左量右量，都是一步五棵苗！赵才背着手，从地这头步到地那头，又从那头步回来，也是一步五棵苗！孟庆林掐着手指算来算去，还是一步五棵苗！黄继长看在眼里，记在心里，试着问他们：“咱也这么留苗行不？”孟庆林说：“要留这么密呀，没点真工夫，打不了粮食！”黄继长说：“对！就得要下真工夫！”可是李宏文接着说：“要肯下真工夫，一步三棵苗，也不比这儿少打粮食。”赵才还很自信说：“秋后比棒子吧，看谁的个头大！”
    队长和小青年原来以为这下有门儿了，没想到这思想的“门”真难打开啊，火气又上来了。黄继长皱起了眉头，认真地说：“咱可不能忘记毛主席的话啊。老年人，受旧影响深，老框框多，接受新东西慢。得让他们多看，多听，慢慢思想就会开窍。现在他们还没想通，是咱工作还没做到家。”
    九月，棒子红穗干了毛，快收秋了。一天，黄继长又领着三个老贫农，到南韩继去参观。他们三个在路上想，南韩继是有名的“旱高台”，今年又没下透雨，留那么密的苗，怎么也不会比咱套地的庄稼好。可是，到了南韩继一瞅，好家伙！人家上地的棒子就是比咱套地的棒子好。棒子秸长得跟房一样高，从上到下，没一片黄叶儿。每棵上结两个大棒子，压得歪歪的。他们步了步，每亩四千棵，不缺苗，不断垄。对比自己种的那百十来亩宽垄，每亩最多二千二百棵，有些服气儿了。赵才不由自主地说：“南韩继真是一亩地当两亩地种，咱一亩最多顶它六分！”还问地里干活的社员：“你们使了多少化肥呀？”“上几车草脚粪呀？”“浇几遍水呀？”“……”没个完，从早看到太阳落，还是黄继长催了好几次，这才恋恋不舍地回来了。
    以前参观回来，他们都是老太太吃蚕豆——嘴闷着，黄继长不问，谁也不言语。这回翻了个儿，黄继长心乐嘴不说，他们倒憋不住了，直朝他说：“继长，回去得好好开个会。”“干啥？”他明知故问。他们说：“得跟大伙说说，别瞅咱们棒子长得挺虎势，比人家南韩继差远啦，赶紧追肥浇水，壮壮籽粒，还许能多增点儿产。”黄继长高兴地说：“行！”回村就开了会，发动群众，浇了一次水，追了一次化肥。
    收秋时，一队青年窄垄密植的棒子，每亩打七百多斤，赶上了南韩继的平均亩产量；老人宽垄苗稀的，每亩只打了五百来斤。他们更服气了。赵才说：“我算信服了，合理密植就是好！”李宏文说：“我可纳闷过来啦！现在是集体化了，有电井，有机器，有化肥，单干的老法门不灵了，得讲科学种田。”孟庆林感慨地说：“咱们种了一辈子地，现在还得学种地。真要活到老学到老啊！”打这以后，他们都成了搞科学实验的积极分子，赵才还被选为全大队技术组长哩。
    三个队长和小青年也都服气了，他们对支部书记黄继长说：“听毛主席的话没错儿。毛主席的话象把金钥匙，什么锁都能打开！”（附图片）
