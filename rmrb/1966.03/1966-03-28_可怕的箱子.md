    The Terrifying Box
    Poem by Tianma, Painting by Yintao
    According to reports: In downtown Saigon, across the street from the office of Westmoreland, the head of the invading American troops in Vietnam, there was a box. It caused the American devils great panic. There's a box on the street; what's inside? The American devils were worried sick, afraid there would be trouble again. Remember the days when the "embassy" was bombed: So many people suffered and kicked the bucket; a bird startled by the twang of a bow can't bear to see even pellets, frightened by every bush and tree, their hearts broken. They hurriedly sent military police and lackeys, guarding the traffic arteries at every intersection; not daring to blink their eyes, with furrowed brows and grimaces. Suddenly, someone strode forward, calmly came to take the box. The military police hurriedly blew their whistles, rushing up to arrest the "Viet Cong element." Quickly open the box, making everyone burst out laughing: Inside were pine nuts, dried fruits... and some books! Pretending to be fat when one is only swollen won't work, the American imperialists are just paper tigers;
  Afflicted with "startle disease" with no cure, there is no prescription for it in the world!

    可怕的箱子
    天马诗  英韬画
    报载：在西贡闹市、侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰办公室所在地对过的一条马路上，放着一只箱子。它引起了美国佬一场惊恐。马路上有只箱子，里面装的是啥子？急坏了美国鬼子，怕的是又出乱子。记得“使馆”挨炸那日子：好多人遭殃翘辫子；惊弓之鸟见不得弹子，草木皆兵吓破了胆子。忙派宪兵警察狗腿子，把守交通要道各口子；眼睛不敢眨下子，愁眉苦脸怪样子。忽然有人迈开步子，不慌不忙来拿箱子，宪兵警察忙吹哨子，扑上去捉“越共分子”。赶快打开箱子，叫人笑破肚子：里面装的松子、干果子……还有一些书本子！打肿脸充不得胖子，美帝是纸糊空架子；
  “吃惊病”害了没法子，世上没有药方子！
