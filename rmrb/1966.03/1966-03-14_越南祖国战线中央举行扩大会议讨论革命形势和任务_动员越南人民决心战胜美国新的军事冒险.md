    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th – The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front held its 11th (enlarged) meeting on the 12th to discuss the revolutionary situation and tasks at the current stage, mobilizing the Vietnamese people to resolutely defeat the American aggressor bandits, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the Fatherland.
    Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, warmly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the soldiers and civilians of both North and South Vietnam in the past year in his opening speech. He said that the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese soldiers and civilians in the past year eloquently prove that Vietnam's resistance to America and national salvation line is completely correct, the strength of the Vietnamese people's unity is invincible, and the Vietnamese people's revolutionary war is invincible. After fighting more than 200,000 American expeditionary troops in the South and thousands of American aircraft in the North, the Vietnamese soldiers and civilians can now draw the conclusion on a practical basis: the Vietnamese soldiers and civilians possess full strength and determination to defeat the American bandits on the ground and in the air, and to defeat any US military service and arm.
    He said, "Now, American imperialism is like a gambler who is unwilling to accept defeat, stubbornly sliding down a new and extremely dangerous path of military adventure, and it is committing extremely barbaric crimes against our people every moment. We warn the American war criminals: they cannot intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people. The more frantically they intensify their war of aggression against our country, the more shameful defeat they will suffer."
    Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, delivered a report on behalf of the Presidium at the meeting. When talking about the work and tasks of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in the current situation, he said that the very arduous and urgent task for the Vietnamese people in the current situation is: to further strengthen the unity of the whole people, resolutely defeat the American imperialist war of aggression under any circumstances, defend the North, liberate the South, and then build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and make positive contributions to the struggle of the world people for national independence, peace, democracy, and social progress.
    Hoang Quoc Viet said that in order to accomplish the above general task, the following specific tasks must be done well: strengthen ideological education work, enhance the unity of the people, vigorously promote the enthusiasm for patriotism and socialism, enhance the determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits, mobilize the people to wholeheartedly support the revolutionary struggle of the compatriots in the South; mobilize the people to promote the patriotic production increase campaign, practice thrift, successfully realize the 1966 national plan, and mobilize and encourage the people to fight bravely and actively participate in national defense construction.

    越南祖国战线中央举行扩大会议讨论革命形势和任务
    动员越南人民决心战胜美国新的军事冒险
    新华社河内十三日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会十二日举行第十一次会议（扩大），讨论目前阶段革命的形势和任务，动员越南人民决心战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜在开幕词中热烈赞扬越南南北两方军民一年来所取得的辉煌胜利。他说，越南军民一年来的辉煌胜利雄辩地证明：越南的抗美救国路线是完全正确的，越南人民团结的力量是无敌的，越南人民的革命战争是无敌的。越南军民一年来在南方同美国二十多万远征军较量，在北方同成千美国飞机较量以后，完全可以在具有实践的基础上得出结论：越南军民完全拥有充分的力量和决心来战胜地面上的和空中的美国强盗，战胜美国的任何军种和兵种。
    他说，“现在，美帝国主义正象一个死不甘心的赌棍，仍然顽固地沿着极其危险的新的军事冒险道路滑下去，它每时每刻都在对我国人民犯下极其野蛮的罪行。我们警告美国战争罪犯：他们是讹诈不了英雄的越南人民的。他们越疯狂地加强对我国的侵略战争，就越将遭到可耻的失败。”
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员黄国越代表主席团在大会上作了报告。他在谈到越南祖国战线在当前形势中的工作和任务时说，当前形势为越南人民提出的非常繁重和迫切的任务是：进一步增强全民团结，不管在任何情况下，都要坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫北方，解放南方，进而建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南，对世界人民争取民族独立、和平、民主和社会进步的斗争作出积极的贡献。
    黄国越说，为完成上述总的任务，必须做好如下具体工作：增强思想教育工作，增强人民的团结一致，大力发扬爱国、爱社会主义的热情，增强战胜美国侵略强盗的决心，动员人民全心全意支援南方同胞的革命斗争；动员人民推进爱国增产竞赛，厉行节约，胜利实现一九六六年国家计划，动员和鼓励人民勇敢战斗和全民积极参加国防建设。
