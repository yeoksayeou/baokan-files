    Sending Theater to Mountain Villages
    ——A Brief Account of the Light Cavalry Team Activities of the Jinzhou Peking Opera Troupe
    Li Muzhi
    The northern wind outside the Great Wall mixed with snowflakes, fluttering and falling endlessly. Over twenty comrades from the Jinzhou Peking Opera Troupe, in response to the Party's call to bring theater to the mountainous areas, were carrying their small plays, small stages, and small props, and carrying their luggage, happily marching towards the mountainous areas of the four counties of Heishan, Suizhong, Yi, and Xingcheng.
    The wind grew stronger, and the snow fell harder. The rugged paths were covered. So, the male comrades helped the female comrades, and continued to climb.
    They reached the top of the mountain. During the rest, the Party Branch Secretary and head of the troupe, while reading Chairman Mao's quotations to the performers, once again introduced the revolutionary spirit of the "Ulanmuqi," guiding everyone to learn from advanced units, and making everyone realize that: to be a revolutionary opera worker, one must dare to brave the wind and snow and engage in struggle. The comrades felt even warmer in their hearts, and their energy was fully charged. What are we afraid of the wind! What are we afraid of the snow! They straightened their chests and continued to advance. Someone took the lead in singing:
      "Forward, forward, forward,
    Our ranks march towards the sun..."
    The singing was so loud that it echoed with the howling mountain wind, spreading into the deep valleys and into the mountain villages, drawing the people out of the mountains.
    That day, they arrived at the Changcheng Commune on the border of Hebei and Liaoning, preparing to perform at the Tianjing Production Team. To reach the Tianjing Production Team, they had to pass through the Longmenkou of the Great Wall and the Three Passes.
    The Three Passes are a peak in the countless mountains of the Great Wall, inhabited by eleven households with over fifty people. Due to the high mountains and steep ridges, even peddlers did not go there in the past, and the farmers had never seen a play performed at their doorstep. However, the comrades of the Jinzhou Peking Opera Troupe understood that it was a very glorious and arduous task to shoulder the responsibility of eliminating cultural blank spots. They finally arrived here. An eighty-four-year-old Wang Dama (Grandma Wang) shed tears of emotion after watching the play: "Chairman Mao really cares about us, sending you to this deep mountain to sing for us!"
    The next morning, they carried their luggage and marched towards the anti-Japanese base area -- Tazigou. After climbing over five mountains and nine ridges, the comrades' clothes were dry then wet, and wet then dry. Although they saw wisps of smoke, they still had to climb for a long time to reach the village. However, no amount of difficulty could overwhelm their strong fighting will and revolutionary optimism. They finally arrived at their destination.
    That night, the quiet mountain village was extraordinarily lively. As soon as night fell, excited men, women, old and young, flocked to the stage from all directions. Just as the play began, a northerly wind suddenly blew. The captain, fearing that the commune members and actors would catch a cold, intended to stop and continue the performance the next day. But no one wanted to leave. Someone said, "As long as you perform, we'll watch even if it snows!" At this time, the actors on stage performed even more vigorously, and the audience burst into warm applause, drowning out the sound of the wind in the mountains. After the play was over, the wind had not subsided, but seeing the farmers' cheerful faces, the comrades' hearts were warm, and they felt that the surroundings were full of spring.
      "The light cavalry ascends the high mountains, daring to climb even without ladders. Passing cliffs and precipices, treating difficulties as small mud balls."
    The day they went from Dizang Temple to Zhengbeigou, they passed through a long winding path and unnamed high mountains and ridges. On the way, some people's feet were blistered, and some people's shoulders were swollen. After walking more than forty li, they finally reached the mountainside. However, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, remembering the glorious example of the revolutionary predecessors, and remembering the expectant eyes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strength returned to their bodies. Some people even improvised the above poem.
    When they arrived at the Zhengbeigou Production Team, they quickly began to perform, bringing joy to the mountain village that had never seen Peking Opera. When they performed "The Red Steward," the sky sprinkled with light rain, and the small wind blew out the gas lamp. So, everyone gathered their flashlights together to provide light, which was a bit like a spotlight on the stage!
    After the play was over, the commune members dispersed contentedly, but an old man with a white beard lingered. Two actors noticed and immediately ran to ask the old man for his opinion. The old man smiled regretfully: "My ears are deaf, I can only hear the gongs and drums, but I can't hear what you're singing!" After hearing this, they immediately squatted in front of the old man and sang a selected excerpt from "Shajiabang" into the old man's ear. After listening, the old man smiled and said, "You sang well! Great, I have finally heard Peking Opera in my life!" Later, they learned that there was a blind couple in the neighboring team who could not come to see the play, so they specially sent several actors to sing for them in their house. After the production team cadres learned about this, they ran to shake hands with the actors and said, "Your spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people has given us great encouragement and strength. We must do a good job in production to thank you."
    After dinner, it was late at night, and everyone was not sleepy yet. Some were reading Chairman Mao's works; some were secretly sweeping the floor and carrying water for the villagers... Everyone felt infinite joy and happiness for being able to contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside and to serve the farmers a little more.
    They not only performed for the farmers, but also did some other work. Every time they went to a place, everyone took the initiative to tutor the local amateur theater groups, spreading cultural seeds; some also took the time to give haircuts, see doctors, and read newspapers to the villagers, just as they often said, "Whatever the farmers need, we will do."
    During a performance at the Sutun Production Team, a hailstorm suddenly struck. In order to promptly rescue the production team's grain, they ran to the fields without removing their costumes, carrying baskets and walking briskly. A teenage female student carried burdens for the first time and got a "red steamed bun" on her shoulder. This time, when harvesting grain, the villagers competed to carry her burden, but she said, "I can't let a carrying pole knock me down." With their help, not a single grain was lost.
    The Fengtun Production Team, twenty li away from here, was building a river dam. The dam-building workers were very busy. One day, a group of people came from nowhere, picked up earth baskets and carried soil, and swung pickaxes to dig mountains! They worked until the sun went down and the moon rose. At this time, someone shouted, "It's time for the play!" Immediately, a lamp at the head of the dam, a lamp at the tail of the dam, the sound of instruments rose, the gongs and drums sounded, and the play began. The workers were surprised to see, "Aren't those characters on the stage the same people who were just competing to carry soil and open mountains?"
    When the troupe was about to leave the village, the front and back of the village were crowded with people seeing them off. An old poor peasant gestured to everyone and said, "They are good actors on the stage, good propagandists off the stage, good hands in the fields, and confidants in the house!" (Attached image)

    送戏到山村
    ——锦州市京剧团开展轻骑队活动散记
    黎牧之
    塞外的北风拌着小雪点，飘飘洒洒，落个没完没了。锦州市京剧团的二十多个同志，为了响应党的号召，把戏送到山区去，正带着自己的小剧目、小舞台和小道具，背着行装，高高兴兴地向黑山、绥中、义县、兴城四个县的山区进军。
    风，越刮越急，雪，越下越大。崎岖的小路被掩没了。于是，男同志又搀着女同志，继续向上爬。
    来到山顶上了。休息的时候，党支部书记、团长在向演职员读毛主席语录的同时，又再一次向大家介绍了“乌兰牧骑”的革命精神，引导大伙向先进单位学习，使每个人认识到：做一个革命戏曲工作者，就要敢于破风踏雪，投入斗争。同志们越听心里越热，满身劲鼓得足足的。风，怕什么！雪，怕什么！他们挺起胸膛，继续挺进。不知是谁领头唱起歌来：
      “向前向前向前，
    我们的队伍向太阳……”
    歌声是这样的嘹亮，它随着呼啸的山风，传进深谷，传进山村，把山区的人们引出来了。
    这天，他们来到了河北与辽宁交界的长城公社，准备去天井生产队演出。去天井生产队，要经过长城的龙门口，三道关。
    三道关，是长城无数山脉的一个高峰，上面住着十一户，五十多口人。由于山高岭峻，过去连货郎也不去，农民从来没在家门口看过戏。可是，锦州市京剧团的同志们明白，把消灭文化空白点的重担挑起来，是十分光荣而又十分艰巨的任务。他们终于来到了这儿。一位八十四岁的王大娘看完戏后，感动得流了泪：“毛主席真关心咱们，派你们来这深山老峪给我们唱戏！”
    次日清晨，他们又背着行装向抗日根据地——塔子沟进军。爬过了五座山，九道岭，同志们的衣服干了湿，湿了干，虽看到炊烟袅袅，还得爬小半天才到村里。可是，天大的困难也压不倒他们坚强的战斗意志和革命乐观主义精神。他们终于来到了目的地。
    这一夜，寂静的山村热闹非凡。刚入夜，兴高采烈的男女老少就从四面八方涌到戏台前。戏刚开演时，忽然刮起北风。队长怕社员和演员受冻，打算停下来第二天续演。大家那里肯走。有人说：“只要演，下雪我们也看呀！”这时台上的演员更加卖力，观众爆发出热烈的掌声，把满山风声也盖过了。戏演完了，风犹未歇，但看到农民个个喜笑颜开，同志们心底都热烘烘的，感到周围是一片春意盎然。
      “轻骑上高山，无梯也敢攀。悬崖陡壁身边过，困难当作小泥丸。”
    他们从地藏寺到正北沟那天，经过了漫长的羊肠小道和不知名的高山大岭。途中有人脚板打起了泡，有人肩膀压肿了。走完了四十多里路才到达山腰。可是，大家想起毛主席的教导，想起革命前辈的光辉榜样，想起贫下中农盼望的眼光，浑身力量又来了。有人还即兴写了上面这几句诗。
    到了正北沟生产队，很快就开始演出，他们给从来没有演过京剧的山村带来了欢乐。演到《红管家》时，天空洒下微雨，小风把汽灯吹灭了，于是，大伙就把手电筒集中起来照光，竟也有点象舞台上的聚光灯哩！
    戏演完了，社员们都心满意足地散去，唯有一位白胡子老大爷迟迟不走。两个演员发现后，马上跑去征求这位老人的意见。老人遗憾地笑道：“我耳朵沉啊，光听见锣鼓响，听不清你们唱啥呀！”他俩听了，立刻就蹲在老人跟前，对着老人的耳朵给唱了段《沙家浜》选曲。老人听完后眉开眼笑地说：“唱的好呀！中了，我这一辈子总算听见京剧了！”后来，他们得知邻队有一对夫妻是盲人，不能来看戏，又特意派了几个演员到这家屋里清唱。这事被生产队干部知道后，跑来握着演员们的手说：“你们这种热心为人民服务的精神，给了我们巨大的鼓舞和力量。我们一定要搞好生产来答谢你们。”
    吃过饭，夜深了，大家还没有睡意。有的在读毛主席著作；有的偷偷地为老乡扫地挑水……每个人都为自己能参加社会主义新农村的建设出一分力量，为农民多服务一点感到无限欢乐和幸福。
    他们不光为农民演出，还做一些别的工作。每到一个地方，每个人都主动地去辅导当地的业余剧团，传播文化种子；有的还抽空给老乡理发、看病、读报，正如他们常说的那样：“农民需要啥，我们就干啥。”
    在苏屯生产队演出时，忽然一阵冰雹袭来。为了及时抢救生产队的粮食，他们没有卸装就跑到田地里，挎着筐篮健步如飞。有个十几岁的女学员，头一天挑担，肩膀给压出了个
  “红馒头”，这次收粮食，老乡们都争着挑她的担子；但她却说：“不能让一条扁担就把我压倒。”在他们的帮助下，一粒粮食都没受到损失。
    离这里二十里远的冯屯生产队，正在筑河坝。修坝的民工忙得很。一天，不知那里来了一股人马，拿起土筐就挑土，抡起镐头就挖山！一直干到太阳落，月亮升。这时有人喊道：“看戏啦！”立刻，坝头一盏灯，坝尾一盏灯，琴声起，锣鼓响，演开了戏，民工们一见忽然惊奇起来：“这台上的角色，不就是方才争着挑土，开山的人么？”
    剧团要离村时，村前村后，黑压压一片送行的人。老贫农对着大伙比划着说：“他们是台上的好演员，台下的好宣传员，田里的好把式，屋里的知心人！”（附图片）
