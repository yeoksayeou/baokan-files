    The Qingyang Special District Science and Technology Association of Gansu Province established a science education film screening team at the beginning of last year. They successively went to people's communes and production brigades in Zhenyuan, Ningxian, Qingyang, and Huachi counties to screen science education films, spreading scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of farmers, and were welcomed by the farmers.
    Through a year of practice, they developed from a situation where "the audience left before the screening was finished" to one where the masses affectionately called them "the grain delivery team sent by Chairman Mao," enabling science and education films to take root among the farmer masses. They have preliminarily explored a path in using the tool of science education films to publicize and popularize science and technology to the broad masses of farmers.
    "Science and education films are different from feature films; they just can't attract people." This was the initial thought of the film team comrades. In order to attract the audience, they selected some films such as "Knowledgeable Old Man," which dealt with ordinary scientific principles, based on their own preferences and went to the countryside to screen them. However, because the content of the films was divorced from production and life, the masses did not like to watch them, and almost everyone left before the screening was finished. This reality aroused deep thought among the film team comrades, and they were determined to conduct in-depth investigation and research after studying Chairman Mao's works.
    After investigation and research, they learned that farmers love to watch movies about "growing crops." Therefore, they put in a lot of effort to find out the distribution of crops and the key areas of major pests and diseases in the entire special district, and put forward the principle of "timely, targeted, and appropriate," so that the content of each screening closely followed the local production needs. In screening, they implemented a combination of special screenings and ordinary screenings. During the day, special screenings were held for production team cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers. If they didn't remember it after watching it once, they would screen it a second time, watching, discussing, and until they understood, remembered, and could use it; in the evening, ordinary screenings were held for the masses for wide publicity.
    On this basis, the comrades of the film team put forward higher requirements: not only must they be timely, targeted, and appropriate, but they must also be responsible to the end, so that the audience can understand, learn, and use it. In order to achieve this requirement, they boldly innovated in publicity work. Starting from the actual situation that rural audiences were not yet accustomed to science education films, they adopted various forms of cooperation for joint publicity. For example, before the screening, the audience was introduced to the general content of the film. During the screening, slides were used, and explanations were given through quick-patter talks or dialect insertions. Explanations were added for places that were difficult to understand, unclear to hear, or not easily understood. After the screening, explanations, dialogues, or slides were used to summarize the important content of the film, such as pest and disease control methods, pesticide names, dosage, and precautions, to help farmers understand the content of the film. As a result, production was promoted and the masses welcomed it.

### 农民爱看“种庄稼”的电影

    农民爱看“种庄稼”的电影
    甘肃省庆阳专区科学技术协会，在去年年初成立了科学教育电影放映队，先后到镇原、宁县、庆阳、华池等县的人民公社和生产大队，巡回放映科学教育影片，向广大农民传播了科学技术知识，受到了农民欢迎。
    他们经过一年的实践，从“没有映完观众就走了”的局面，发展到群众亲切地称他们是“毛主席派来的送粮队”，使科教片在农民群众中扎下了根。在利用科学教育电影这一工具向广大农民群众宣传，普及科学技术方面，初步摸出了一条路子。
    “科教片和故事片不一样，就是吸引不了人”，这是电影队同志最初的想法。为了吸引观众，他们就根据自己的喜爱，挑选了一些象《知识老人》一类普通科学原理的片子，到农村去放映。可是，由于影片内容脱离生产和生活实际，群众不爱看，没等映完就走得差不多了。这一现实情况，引起了电影队同志们的深思，他们带着问题学习了毛主席著作，才下定决心深入调查研究。
    经过调查研究，了解到农民爱看“种庄稼”的电影。于是，他们又下了一番功夫，摸清了全专区的农作物分布情况和主要病虫害的重点地区，提出了“适时、对口、对路”的方针，使每次放映内容都紧跟当地生产需要走。在放映中，实行专场与普通场相结合的方法。白天为生产队干部、技术员、老农放映专场，一遍没记下，再放第二遍，边看，边议，直到看懂、记下、能用上为止；晚上向群众放映普通场，广泛宣传。
    电影队的同志们在这个基础上，又提出了更高的要求：不仅要做到适时、对口、对路，而且要一包到底，使观众看懂、学会、用上。为达到这一要求，他们在宣传工作上大胆革新。他们从农村观众对科教影片还不习惯等实际情况出发，采取多种形式配合一起宣传。如在映前给观众介绍影片大体内容，映时配合放映幻灯片、用快板说唱或方言插话来配合解释等，针对看不懂、听不清、不易理解的地方，加以解说，映后又用解说、对话或幻灯片，把影片重要内容，如病虫害防治方法、农药名、用药量及注意事项等作一小结，帮助农民理解影片内容。这样做的结果，促进了生产，受到了群众的欢迎。
