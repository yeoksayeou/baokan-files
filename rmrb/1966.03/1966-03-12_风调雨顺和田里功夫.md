    Favorable weather conditions are important natural conditions for good crop growth. However, "favorable weather" in nature is relative. It is impossible for every crop in a year or a season to have "favorable weather." Even for a single crop, it is rare for the entire growth stage from planting to harvesting to have "favorable weather." For example, crops such as rice, cotton, soybeans, and sorghum are all planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn, but because their growth patterns are different, their requirements for the natural conditions of wind and rain also vary.
    Moreover, our country's territory is so vast, with thousands of kilometers between north and south, east and west, how can "heaven" have the ability to take care of everything? Besides, there are so many crops on the earth, some resistant to cold and tolerant of heat, some preferring mountains and water, some with tall stalks and some with short stalks, some with deep roots and some with shallow roots... They all have their own unique temperaments and preferences. How can "heaven" adapt to all needs? There is a folk song in the water villages of southern Jiangsu: "It's hard to be the weather in April, rice seedlings need warmth and wheat needs cold." In fact, it's not just April that's hard for "heaven" to be; every day is hard. In a word, to grow crops well, it is not enough to rely on "heaven" for favorable weather; the main thing is to rely on "fieldwork."
    Are the Dazhai-style advanced agricultural units all from places with "favorable weather"? Are they all from places with unique advantages? Obviously not. The "secret" to their good production lies in their "fieldwork": building ponds and dams, stacking stone embankments, creating level terraces, opening mountain canals, building pumping stations, putting reservoirs on high mountains, creating "three-story" irrigation systems, and "holding the Dragon King's nose"; "sifting" the land, using "foolish" effort to sift out gravel, building entrepreneurial fields, and creating "iron rice bowls." This is the fieldwork that transformed the poor mountain ravine into a land of rice and grain by the Xia Dingjia people in a "hopeless place" where "heaven and earth bring their own three parts of disaster"!
      "Building terraces into 'eternal strongholds'," the entire brigade removed 1,500 recumbent stones, dug 27 ring-mountain canals, and transformed 70% of the dry land into irrigated land. They built more than 500 gully dams, dammed 11 gullies, and greened nine bald mountains. This is the fieldwork that allowed the people of Nan Gunlonggou, the "Dazhai of Hebei," to jump from a grain yield of just over 300 jin per mu to over 1,000 jin!
    Dazhai-style advanced agricultural units can increase production in wind and rain and reap harvests in the face of disasters precisely because of their unyielding and solid fieldwork.
    "Crops don't ask about fathers and mothers; hard work at home naturally makes them strong." Is it relying on "heaven" to bestow "favorable weather," or is it relying on "fieldwork" to seize favorable weather? This is the watershed between revolutionaries and fatalists, between being masters of nature and being slaves of nature.
      "The play is in the singing, the field is in the planting." Whether the fieldwork is deep or not ultimately depends on whether people's work is done "at home." The reason why the fieldwork of Dazhai-style advanced agricultural units is so strong is because they highlight politics, and their political and ideological work is strong. Didn't some people in the Xia Dingjia Brigade initially dislike the labor-intensive land preparation, thinking it was not worthwhile, and want to abandon this bitter errand of pounding "stone eggs"? However, revolutionary entrepreneurial education enabled everyone to understand that land preparation is "digging out the roots of poverty, planting the roots of wealth, and building socialist ground piles." Thus, a great force of moving mountains and filling seas burst forth in everyone's hearts, truly changing the face of the rivers and mountains.

    风调雨顺和田里功夫
    赤秀
    “风调雨顺”，是庄稼生长得好的重要自然条件。不过，自然界里的“风调雨顺”是相对的。一年或是一季庄稼中，项项作物都“风调雨顺”的情况是不可能有的。就是单项作物，从种到收整个生育阶段都“风调雨顺”的情况也是极少的。譬如，水稻、棉花、大豆、高粱这些作物，虽然它们都是春种秋收，但是由于它们的生育规律不同，对风风雨雨的自然条件的要求也各个不一。
    何况，我国的地域是如此辽阔，南北东西相距几千公里，“老天爷”哪有这个能耐，顾此又顾彼呢？再说，大地上的庄稼又是如此繁多，有抗寒耐暑的，有喜山傍水的，有高秆矮秆的，有深根浅根的……它们都有自己独特的脾气和嗜好，“老天爷”哪能适应一切需要呢？苏南水乡有首民歌：“做天难做四月天，秧要暖和麦要寒”，其实，做“天”也并非四月天难做，哪一天都是难做的。一句话说到底，要种好庄稼，靠“老天爷”风调雨顺是不行的，主要应当靠“田里功夫”。
    大寨式的农业先进单位，难道它们都是从“风调雨顺”的地方来的吗？难道它们都是从得天独厚的地方来的吗？显然不是。它们生产好的“奥秘”就在于它们的“田里功夫”：砌塘坝，垒石堰，搞水平梯田，开盘山渠，建扬水站，把水库修上高山，造“三层楼”灌溉系统，“牵住龙王鼻子”；土地“大过筛”，用“笨”功夫筛净碎石，建创业田，造“铁饭碗”。这就是下丁家人在“天地自带三分灾”的“绝地”，变穷山沟为米粮川的田里功夫！
      “把一块块梯田修成‘万年牢’”，全大队拔除卧牛石一千五百个，挖环山渠二十七条，百分之七十旱地变水浇地。筑起五百多道谷坊坝，闸起十一条沟，绿化九座秃山。这就是“河北大寨”南滚龙沟人从粮食亩产不过三百斤跃过千斤的田里功夫！
    大寨式农业先进单位所以能在风雨之中增产，在灾害面前丰收，正是靠他们那不屈不挠、扎扎实实的田里功夫。
    “庄稼不问爹和娘，功夫到家自然壮”。是靠“老天”来恩赐“风调雨顺”，还是靠“田里功夫”来夺取风调雨顺？这是革命者和宿命论者、是作大自然主人还是当大自然奴隶的分水岭。
      “戏在人唱，田在人种”。田里功夫是否深厚，归根到底，在于人的工作是否做到了“家”。大寨式农业先进单位的田里功夫所以过硬，就是因为他们突出政治，政治思想工作过硬。下丁家大队开始不是有些人嫌整地费工划不来，想丢下这捣“石蛋蛋”的苦差使么？但是革命的创业教育使大伙懂得了整地是“挖穷根，扎富根，修社会主义地桩”的道理。于是，每个人的心胸中迸发出移山填海的伟大力量，真正地使河山改变了面貌。
