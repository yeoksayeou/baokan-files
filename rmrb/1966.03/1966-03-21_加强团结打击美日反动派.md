    Strengthen Unity to Strike Down the Anti-Communist American and Japanese Reactionaries
    By Renmin Ribao Commentator
    Over six hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Japan held a massive "National Unified Action" throughout Japan, opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and demanding protection of their right to live. This magnificent struggle fully demonstrates the Japanese people's high fighting spirit and powerful strength in opposing the American and Japanese reactionaries.
    The Japanese people's "National Unified Action" took place at a time when U.S. imperialism was plotting to further expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, and the Sato government was stepping up its revival of militarism, actively serving the U.S.'s policies of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism is increasingly turning Japan into an advanced base for launching aggressive wars in Asia, using the Japanese reactionaries as its aggressive pawns. The Sato government, on the other hand, is increasingly following Washington's instructions, willingly acting as an accomplice to the U.S.'s aggression against Vietnam. It has recently gone to great lengths to assist the U.S. in expanding its war of aggression, plotting to "invite" the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky to Japan for activities, allowing U.S. nuclear-powered ships to enter Japanese ports, attempting to fix the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" permanently and participate in U.S. imperialism's "nuclear strategy system." It even openly clamors to send troops abroad to serve as a vanguard for U.S. aggression in Asia. In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and retrace the old path of Tojo, the Sato government has been making every effort to intensify its plunder and oppression of the Japanese people, placing the broad masses of the people in dire straits. Such reactionary acts by the Sato government cannot but arouse increasingly strong indignation and resolute opposition from the Japanese people of all strata. This "National Unified Action" is another powerful demonstration by the Japanese people against the American and Japanese reactionaries and a major review of the Japanese people's strength. It will undoubtedly further promote the great unity of the Japanese people and deal a heavy blow to the American and Japanese reactionaries.
    The Japanese people this time closely combined the political struggle for independence, peace, and democracy with the economic struggle for safeguarding their right to live, directing the spearhead of struggle at the American and Japanese reactionaries. The declaration adopted by the central rally expressed the determination of the broad masses of the Japanese people to take this successfully held unified action as a starting point and to carry out more powerful struggles on all fronts. The Japanese people will never allow the American and Japanese reactionaries to push them into the abyss of aggressive war. The Japanese people's struggle against the American and Japanese reactionaries will surely develop more widely and fiercely.

    加强团结打击美日反动派
    本报评论员
    六十多万日本各阶层人民在日本各地举行了声势浩大的“全国大统一行动”，反对美帝国主义侵略越南和要求保障生活权利。这一次气势磅礴的斗争行动，充分显示出日本人民反对美日反动派的高昂斗志和强大力量。
    日本人民的这次“全国大统一行动”，是在美帝国主义策划进一步扩大侵越战争、佐藤政府加紧复活军国主义、积极为美国的侵略政策和战争政策效劳的时候举行的。美帝国主义正在日益把日本变成为它在亚洲发动侵略战争的前进基地，利用日本反动派作为它的侵略走卒。而佐藤政府则变本加厉地遵循华盛顿的意旨，甘心充当美国侵略越南的帮凶。它最近为美国扩大侵略战争大卖力气，阴谋“邀请”南越傀儡阮高其到日本活动，允许美国的核动力舰进驻日本港口，企图把日美“安全条约”长期固定下来并参加美帝国主义的“核战略体制”。它甚至公开叫嚷要派兵出国，给美国侵略亚洲当马前卒。佐藤政府为了加紧复活日本军国主义，重走东条的老路，竭力加强对日本人民的掠夺和压迫，把广大人民置于水深火热之中。佐藤政府的这种反动行径，当然不能不激起日本各阶层人民日益强烈的愤慨和坚决的反对。这一次“全国大统一行动”，是日本人民对美日反动派又一次强有力的示威，也是日本人民力量的一次大检阅。它毫无疑问地将进一步促进日本人民的大团结，并给予美日反动派以沉重的打击。
    日本人民这一次把争取独立、和平和民主的政治斗争同要求保障生活权利的经济斗争紧密结合起来，把斗争的矛头指向美日反动派。中央大会通过的宣言，表示了广大日本人民决心以这一次成功地举行的统一行动作为起点，要在各条战线上开展更加有力的斗争。日本人民绝对不会允许美日反动派把他们推进侵略战争的深渊。日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争，必将会更广泛、更猛烈地开展。
