    According to a report in the *Liberation Daily*, Leping County in Jiangxi Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is taking a long-term, forward-looking approach, adopting various forms to develop and build up its mountainous areas, achieving remarkable results. Since 1957, the county has successively established eight state-owned reclamation farms and twenty-two commune-run forest farms, creating 374 new mountain villages, transforming those poor mountain gullies where "it is difficult to farm due to high mountains and long roads, and there are two years of famine out of three" into new scenes of flourishing forests and abundant grain, and thriving in five industries.
  Adopting Various Forms to Build Mountainous Areas
    Leping County is a semi-mountainous county in the northeast of Jiangxi Province. Most of its mountainous areas are old revolutionary base areas and guerrilla zones. In the past, due to repeated looting by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the population sharply declined and production was severely damaged. After liberation, with the care and help of the Party and the government, the people in the mountainous areas rebuilt their homes and developed production. In 1957, the Leping County Committee of the Communist Party of China responded to the call of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee and successively sent a large number of cadres to work with the masses in the mountainous areas, establishing eight state-owned reclamation farms, thus advancing the construction of the mountainous areas to a new stage. However, due to the small population and large land area in the mountainous areas, the uneven distribution of villages, and the resulting extensive cultivation, the grain yield per unit area was still very low, and natural resources could not be fully utilized.
    After 1958, the Leping County Committee of the Communist Party of China realized that relying solely on state-owned reclamation farms was not enough to fully develop and build up the mountainous areas; it was also necessary to further mobilize the collective production enthusiasm of the vast number of people in the mountainous areas. In order to find new ways to develop the mountainous areas, the Leping County Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted extensive investigation and research work, led by responsible comrades of the County Committee, and gradually clarified five methods for developing and building up the mountainous areas: establishing state-owned reclamation farms that comprehensively manage agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and industry, mainly with dispatched cadres and workers; mobilizing some urban residents and educated youth to enter the mountains to establish reclamation farms, under the unified leadership and organization of the towns; in old mountain villages where the population is concentrated and farming is inconvenient, the commune Party committee takes unified leadership and, according to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, systematically moves some peasant households into the mountain valleys to establish new mountain villages; collectively migrating people from densely populated plains areas to the mountains in a guided and planned manner to open up new mountain villages; and in communes and brigades with large areas of barren mountains and relatively concentrated forests, establishing commune-run or brigade-run forest farms by drawing some labor forces, in accordance with the relevant policies of the Party. In addition to the reclamation farms being under state ownership, the remaining organizational forms are all under collective ownership, with a scale equivalent to that of a production team, becoming the basic accounting unit, and under the unified leadership of the affiliated commune or brigade.
    In recent years, the Leping County Committee has made the work of developing and building up the mountainous areas a key task for the entire county, continuously strengthening its leadership over the work in the mountainous areas politically and organizationally. They selected a group of cadres from various county-level organs and organizations to be stationed in the mountainous areas for a long time, and district and commune also selected thousands of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to work in the mountainous areas; they also organized more than 1,000 educated youth to settle in the mountainous areas, and sent more than ten agricultural science and technology personnel to participate in the construction of the mountainous areas.
      Emphasize Politics, Promote Revolutionization
    The Leping County Committee believes that developing and building up the mountainous areas is a revolutionary cause that must be realized by relying on the strength of the people. They constantly organize cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, adhere to highlighting politics, arm the vast number of cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and promote the ideological revolutionization of the people.
    In the early days of establishing farms and villages, living conditions were very difficult, and production was lacking in funds and agricultural implements. Cadres had to grasp production, construction, and a large amount of mass work, making the tasks quite arduous. In the face of numerous difficulties, the Party organizations at all levels in the mountainous areas, under the leadership of the County Committee, extensively organized cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," learning the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai in self-reliance and striving for progress, and educating the masses to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary base areas, establishing a revolutionary spirit of settling down in the mountains, starting a business arduously, and building the mountains. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses has been continuously improved. In recent years, many outstanding cadres and thousands of "Six Good Members" have emerged in the mountainous areas of the county.
    The struggle of Leping County to develop and build up the mountainous areas has also powerfully promoted the revolutionization of all walks of life in the county.
    In recent years, all departments of the county, including culture and education, health, finance and trade, and transportation, have been linked to reclamation farms, new mountain villages, and forest farms, frequently listening to their opinions and requests, and incorporating support and assistance to the construction of the mountainous areas into their work plans. The cultural and educational departments have selected more than 670 full-time teachers to teach in the mountainous areas, opening more than 300 full-day middle and primary schools in the mountainous areas, and adopting various forms such as half-farming and half-study and night schools to bring culture to the mountainous areas. The health departments have established a regular mobile medical service system in the mountainous areas and trained a large number of non-production health workers for the mountainous areas, enabling many mountainous areas to "treat minor illnesses without leaving the village." The commercial and supply and marketing departments have readjusted the supply and marketing outlets based on the layout of the new villages in the mountainous areas, and also organized a group of peddlers to deliver goods to the mountains regularly. The transportation departments have vigorously assisted the masses in the mountainous areas in building roads, constructing nearly 500 li of roads in recent years. This support from all sides has brought great convenience to the production and lives of the masses in the mountainous areas.
        A New Scene in the Mountain Economy
    Due to the adoption of various forms to develop and build up the mountainous areas, and the adherence to the policy of walking on two legs with both state-run and collectively-run enterprises, the face of the mountainous areas in Leping County has greatly changed, achieving remarkable results in promoting the development of the socialist economy in the vast mountainous areas.
    The establishment of reclamation farms and new mountain villages has gradually refined the farming system in the mountainous areas, expanded the multiple cropping index accordingly, gradually transformed large areas of low-yield fields, and steadily increased grain output. In 1965, the grain output in the mountainous areas of the county increased by more than 50% compared to 1957. The grain yield per unit area of individual reclamation farms and some new mountain villages has exceeded the target stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program." Reclamation farms, new mountain villages, and forest farms have universally implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link, diversifying operations, and promoting all-round development," as well as the principle of "adapting to local conditions and focusing on one industry," effectively developing and utilizing mountain resources. The Wangchongwu Reclamation Farm cultivated 57 mu of mulberry trees in 1964, and last year, it increased a large amount of income from silkworm raising. The Shanmen Temple New Mountain Village of Chexi Commune used the abundant grass and fodder in the mountainous areas to set up a breeding farm for draft cattle, breeding five calves in one year, and collectively raised more than 30 pigs. With the substantial increase in production, the income of commune members and the contributions to the state have also increased year by year.
    The Leping County Committee believes that developing and building up the mountainous areas is a long-term and arduous revolutionary task. Although some achievements have been made in recent years, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently. The County Committee has required its subordinate Party organizations at all levels to continue to emphasize highlighting politics, promote the revolutionary spirit, constantly practice, constantly summarize, consciously grasp objective laws, better solve the various problems encountered in the advance, and accelerate the pace of developing and building up the mountainous areas.

    思想上山　干部上山　工作上山
    乐平县高瞻远瞩长期建设山区
    许多穷山沟都成了林茂粮丰、五业兴旺的新山村
    据解放日报报道　江西乐平县高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高瞻远瞩，采用多种形式开发山区、建设山区，取得显著成绩。自一九五七年以来，全县先后兴办了八个国营垦殖场和二十二个社办林场，建立了三百七十四个新山村，使那些“山高路远种田难，三年就有两年荒”的穷山沟，呈现出林茂粮丰、五业兴旺的新景象。
  采取多种形式建设山区
    乐平县是江西省东北部的一个半山区县。这里的大部分山区是革命老根据地和游击区，过去因为屡遭国民党反动派洗劫，人烟骤减，生产受到极大破坏。解放后，山区人民在党和政府的关怀与帮助下，重建了家园，发展了生产。一九五七年，中共乐平县委响应江西省委号召，陆续下放了大批干部同山区群众一起，办起了八个国营垦殖场，使山区建设跨进了新的阶段。但是由于山区人少田多，村庄分布不平衡，以及由此带来的耕作粗放，因此粮食单位面积产量仍然很低，自然资源仍然不能充分利用。
    一九五八年以后，中共乐平县委认识到全面开发建设山区，仅仅靠全民所有制的国营垦殖场是不够的，还必须把广大山区人民的集体生产积极性进一步调动起来。为了寻找开发山区新的途径，乐平县委遵照毛主席的教导，由县委负责同志带头，做了大量的调查研究工作，逐渐明确了开发山区、建设山区的五种办法，就是：以下放干部和职工为主，兴办农、林、牧、副、渔、工综合经营的国营垦殖场；由城镇统一领导、统一组织，动员一部分城镇居民和知识青年进山，兴办垦殖场；在居住集中、耕作不便的老山村，由公社党委统一领导，根据群众的自愿原则，有计划地将一部分农户迁进山坞建立新山村；从人口稠密的平原地区，有领导有规划地集体移民上山，开辟新山村，在荒山面积较大、山林比较集中的公社和大队，根据党的有关政策，抽调部分劳力建立社办或队办林场。这几种组织形式，除垦殖场是全民所有制以外，其余都是集体所有制，其规模相当于生产队一级，成为基本核算单位，由所属公社或大队统一领导。
    几年来，乐平县委把开发建设山区的工作列为全县工作的重点，不断地从政治上、组织上加强对山区工作的领导。他们从县属各机关、团体抽调了一批干部到山区长期驻队，并由各区、社抽调了数以千计的共产党员和共青团员到山区工作；又组织了一千余名知识青年，到山区插队落户，派出十多名农业科学技术人员参加山区建设。
      突出政治，促进革命化
    乐平县委认为，开发山区，建设山区，是一项革命的事业，必须依靠人民群众的力量来实现。他们不断组织干部、群众学习毛主席著作，坚持突出政治，以毛泽东思想武装广大干部和群众，促进人的思想革命化。
    建场、建村初期，生活条件十分艰苦，生产上缺资金、少农具，干部既要抓生产，又要抓建设，还要做大量的群众工作，任务相当艰巨。在重重困难面前，山区各级党组织在县委领导下，广泛组织干部和群众，学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《愚公移山》《纪念白求恩》等文章，学习大寨自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，并且教育群众，把革命根据地的光荣传统接过来、传下去，树立在山区安家落户、艰苦创业的革命事业心。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，干部和群众的革命思想觉悟不断提高。几年来，全县山区涌现出许多优秀干部和数以千计的“六好社员”。
    乐平县开发建设山区的斗争，还有力地推动了全县各行各业的革命化。
    几年来，全县文教、卫生、财贸、交通等各个部门，都纷纷同垦殖场、新山村和林场挂钩，经常听取他们的意见和要求，把支援和扶助山区建设纳入本单位的工作计划。文教部门抽调了六百七十多名专职教师到山区教学，在山区开办了三百余所全日制中学和小学，并采取半农半读、夜校等多种形式，把文化送进山区。卫生部门建立了山区定期巡回医疗制度，并为山区培养了大批不脱产的卫生员，使不少山区做到了“小病不出村”。商业、供销部门根据山区新村的布局，重新调整了供销网点，还组织了一批货郎担定期送货上山。交通运输部门大力协助山区群众兴建公路，几年来共修筑公路近五百里。这些来自各方面的支援，给山区的生产和群众生活带来了莫大便利。
        山区经济一片新景象
    由于采取多种形式开发建设山区，坚持了全民办和集体办两条腿走路的方针，乐平县山区面貌大为改观，在促进广大山区社会主义经济的发展中取得了显著成绩。
    垦殖场和新山村的建立，使山区的耕作制度逐渐趋于精细，复种指数相应扩大，大片低产田逐步得到改造，粮食产量稳步上升。一九六五年，全县山区的粮食产量比一九五七年增加百分之五十以上。个别垦殖场和有些新山村，粮食单位面积产量已超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。垦殖场、新山村和林场都普遍贯彻执行了“以粮为纲，多种经营，全面发展”的方针，以及“因地制宜，一业为主”的原则，卓有成效地开发和利用了山区资源。王冲坞垦殖场在一九六四年培育了五十七亩桑树，去年就增加了一大笔养蚕的收入。车溪公社山门寺新山村利用山区丰富的草料，办起了耕牛繁殖场，一年就繁殖了五头小牛，还集体养猪三十多头。随着生产的大幅度增长，社员收入和对国家的贡献也逐年增多。
    乐平县委认为，开发山区、建设山区是一项长期的艰巨的革命任务，近几年来虽然取得了一些成绩，但是仍有不少问题急待解决。县委已要求所属各级党组织，继续强调突出政治，发扬革命精神，通过不断实践，不断总结，自觉地掌握客观规律，更好地解决前进中遇到的各种问题，加速开发山区、建设山区的步伐。
