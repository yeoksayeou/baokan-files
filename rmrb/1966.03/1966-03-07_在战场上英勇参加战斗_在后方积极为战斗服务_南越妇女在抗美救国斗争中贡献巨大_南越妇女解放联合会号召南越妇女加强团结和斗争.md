    Fighting Bravely on the Battlefield, Actively Serving the Battle in the Rear
    South Vietnamese Women Make Huge Contributions in the Anti-American National Salvation Struggle
    South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation Calls on South Vietnamese Women to Strengthen Unity and Struggle
    (Xinhua News Agency, March 6th) (Our correspondent reports) The broad masses of women in South Vietnam have made tremendous contributions in the vigorous Anti-American National Salvation Struggle over the past few years. To date, more than one hundred women have been awarded the noble honors of the Liberation Medal, Military Merit Medal, and War Merit Medal.
    According to statistics, approximately 50,000 women in South Vietnam are currently participating in guerrilla and self-defense forces, and 40,000 women are serving in the Liberation Army and local forces, undertaking various tasks such as combat, liaison, reconnaissance, and rescue. Female hero Nguyễn Thị Định holds the position of Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces. The female guerrillas have participated in more than 3,000 ambushes, assaults, and encirclements. These female soldiers, tempered in the flames of war, are brave and resourceful, and have struck the American and puppet troops with terror in every battle.
    Many resourceful and courageous female heroes have emerged from the fighting in South Vietnam, some becoming crack "marksmen." Sister An, a female "marksman" from Quảng Nam province, set a new record for female marksmen last year. In less than a month, she used twelve bullets to kill ten enemies and wound two. Nguyễn Thị Vụ, a tenant farmer from Trà Vinh province and a mother of six, overcame all difficulties and insisted on participating in the fighting, harboring a deep hatred for the enemy. On one occasion, shortly after giving birth, a battle broke out, and she unhesitatingly took up arms. She has participated in dozens of battles, twice forcing the enemy in two guard posts to surrender, seizing all the weapons in the posts. Tạ Thị Kiều, a militia cadre from Bến Tre province, is not only brave and skilled in battle, but also resourceful, having taken enemy strongholds three times with her bare hands. Tạ Thị Kiều and Nguyễn Thị Vụ were both awarded the title of "Hero of the Liberation Army" last year.
    In addition to participating in combat, more than 37,000 women in South Vietnam are engaged in transportation and liaison and transport work for combat service. These women risked their lives to transport supplies, deliver letters, and collect enemy information. Some have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.
    Young women in South Vietnam participate in combat and support combat operations, while older women participate in the "Mothers of Warriors Association." There are more than 12,000 "Warrior Mothers" in South Vietnam. These white-haired mothers warmly comfort the Liberation Army, carefully care for the wounded and sick, and dedicate all their strength to the Anti-American National Salvation cause.
    South Vietnamese women are also shock troops in the political struggle. They frequently participate in rallies and demonstrations to oppose the rule of the American puppets.
    In the heart of the American puppet clique, women also actively participate in the struggle against persecution, conscription, and exploitation. Trần Thị Lý of Quảng Nam province, Phan Thị Cấm of Quảng Trị province, and Nguyễn Thị Châu of Saigon suffered torture after being arrested by the enemy, but they remained loyal and unyielding, displaying great heroism in the face of the enemy.
    Many women also actively participate in the work of disintegrating the puppet army.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 5th) According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on the eve of the "March 8th" International Women's Day, the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Federation issued a call, urging South Vietnamese women to resolutely stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle, strengthen unity and struggle, and fight to the end to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the motherland.
    The call stated that the Women's Liberation Federation has two million members and has become the core force of South Vietnamese women in political struggle, armed struggle, and all other anti-resistance causes.
    The call stated, "In the past five years, we have organized nearly 30 million people to participate in 285,000 face-to-face political struggles with the enemy, and launched continuous attacks on the puppet army and puppet regimes at all levels. Since American troops entered and occupied South Vietnam in large numbers in 1965, we have directly fought the American expeditionary forces and achieved victories. We have established a female militia guerrilla force of 50,000 sisters, using various weapons including pointed stakes, nail boards, landmines, grenades, explosives, and rifles to carry out more than 3,000 ambushes, assaults, and encirclements, forcing the enemy in many strongholds to surrender or withdraw. Since the Liberation Armed Forces began to launch major campaigns at the end of 1964, the sisters have actively participated in youth assault teams, construction teams, logistics work, supply and relief work, transportation work, and the transportation of the wounded, making huge contributions. In addition, the sisters have taken on all the work in the rear in place of men who have joined the army to kill the enemy. Tens of thousands of female cadres have grown up and participated in the activities of various departments. Many sisters have also participated in the command of the Liberation Armed Forces and the National Liberation Front committees at all levels from the central to the village level."
    The call then praised the production and combat achievements of North Vietnamese women in the "Three Responsibilities" movement, and praised their contributions in resisting the destructive war of American imperialism.
    The call urged women in the liberated areas to carry forward the heroic and unyielding tradition of struggle, unite as one, share weal and woe, help each other, consolidate the battle position, defend their homes, promote the political and armed struggle against the enemy, and promote production and other aspects of the war of resistance.
    The call expressed to the women of North Vietnam, the flesh-and-blood compatriots of the North, and the sisters of the South who have gathered in the North: No matter how ferocious and brutal the American bandits are, no matter how much sacrifice they must endure, the women of the South will resolutely stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle and shed the last drop of blood to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the motherland.
    The call appealed to women all over the world to be vigilant against the American imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and to rise up and sever the murderous claws of American imperialism in intensifying the destructive war in South Vietnam.
    The call also appealed to American women to carry forward the struggle tradition of the female workers of Chicago and promote and expand the movement against the American government's war of aggression in South Vietnam.
    The call concluded: "The women of South Vietnam are fully confident that, relying on their own spirit of unity and struggle and that of the 31 million compatriots across the country, and with the sympathy and support of the progressive people and women of the world, we will surely achieve final victory."

    在战场上英勇参加战斗　在后方积极为战斗服务
    南越妇女在抗美救国斗争中贡献巨大
    南越妇女解放联合会号召南越妇女加强团结和斗争
    据新华社六日讯　本社记者报道：越南南方广大妇女几年来在轰轰烈烈的抗美救国斗争中作出了巨大的贡献。到目前止，已有一百多名妇女分别荣获了解放勋章、军功勋章和战功勋章等崇高奖赏。
    据统计，目前，在越南南方约五万名妇女参加了游击队和自卫队，有四万名妇女在解放军和地方部队中担任战斗、联络、侦察、救护等各项任务，女英雄阮氏定就担任了越南南方解放武装力量副司令员的职务。女游击队员们曾经参加三千多次伏击战、突击战和包围战。这些在战火中锻炼出来的女战士，英勇机智，在各次战斗中打得美伪军丧魂落魄。
    越南南方妇女在战斗中，涌现了许多智勇双全的女英雄，有的成为百发百中的“神枪手”。广南省的女“神枪手”安姐，去年创造了女神枪手的杀敌新纪录。她在不到一个月的时间里，用十二发子弹，打死敌人十名，打伤两名。茶荣省雇农出身的阮氏坞是六个孩子的母亲，但是她怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，克服一切困难，坚持参加战斗。一次，她产后不久，战斗发生了，她毫不犹豫地拿起武器作战。她前后已经参加了几十次战斗，她曾两次迫使两个哨所的敌人投降，缴获哨所里的全部武器。槟椥省民兵干部谢氏娇，既英勇善战，又足智多谋，曾经三次赤手空拳用计拿下敌人的据点。谢氏娇和阮氏坞，在去年同时荣获“解放军英雄”的称号。
    除了参加战斗之外，越南南方约有三万七千多名妇女从事交通联络和为战斗服务的运输工作。这些妇女出生入死，运送物资，传递信件，搜集敌情。有的人为了执行任务而献出了生命。
    越南南方年轻的妇女参加战斗和支援战斗的工作，年老的就参加“战士母亲会”。在越南南方有一万二千多名“战士母亲”。这些白发苍苍的母亲们热情慰劳解放军，细心照料伤病员，为抗美救国的事业献出自己的全部力量。
    越南南方妇女也是政治斗争中的突击队。她们经常参加集会、示威，反对美伪统治。
    在美伪集团的心脏地区，妇女们也踊跃参加反迫害、反抓丁、反剥削的斗争。广南省的陈氏里、广治省的潘氏柑和西贡市的阮氏珠，在被敌人逮捕后受尽折磨，但她们忠贞不屈，在敌人面前表现出高度的英雄气概。
    许多妇女还积极参加瓦解伪军的工作。
    据新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在“三八”国际妇女节即将来临的时候，越南南方妇女解放联合会发表号召书，号召越南南方妇女坚决站在反美斗争的最前线，加强团结和斗争，为保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国而战斗到底。
    号召书说，妇女解放联合会拥有两百万会员，它已成了越南南方妇女在政治斗争、武装斗争和其它一切抗战事业中的核心力量。
    号召书说，“在过去五年中，我们组织了近三千万人次参加了二十八万五千次同敌人进行的面对面的政治斗争，向伪军和各级伪政权进行了连续不断的进攻。从一九六五年美军大量开入和侵占越南南方以后，我们已经直接同美国远征军进行斗争，而且取得了胜利。我们已经建立起了一支拥有五万名姐妹参加的女民兵游击队，使用包括尖桩、钉板、地雷、手榴弹、炸药和步枪等各种武器进行了三千多次伏击战、突击战和包围战，迫使许多据点的敌人投降或撤退。从一九六四年底解放武装力量开始展开各个大战役的时候起，姐妹们积极地参加了各青年突击队、民工队、后勤工作、供应接济工作、运输工作和运送伤员等工作，作出了巨大贡献。此外，姐妹们还顶替参军杀敌的男子承担起后方的一切工作。数以万计的妇女干部已经成长起来，参加了各个部门的活动。许多姐妹还参加了解放武装力量指挥部和从中央到乡的各级民族解放阵线委员会。”
    号召书接着赞扬越南北方妇女在“三承担”运动中所取得的生产和战斗成就，赞扬她们在反击美帝国主义破坏性战争中作出的贡献。
    号召书号召解放区妇女们发扬英勇不屈的斗争传统，团结一心、甘苦与共，互相帮助，巩固战斗阵地，保卫家园，促进反对敌人的政治斗争和武装斗争，推动生产和抗战事业的其它方面的工作。
    号召书向越南北方妇女、北方骨肉同胞和集结到北方的南方姐妹们表示：不管美国强盗多么凶恶残暴，不管要忍受多大的牺牲，南方妇女也要坚决站在反美斗争的最前线，为解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国而流洒最后一滴血。
    号召书呼吁全世界妇女警惕美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋，起来斩断美帝国主义在越南南方加强毁灭性战争的杀人魔爪。
    号召书还呼吁美国妇女发扬芝加哥城女工的斗争传统，促进和扩大反对美国政府在越南南方的侵略战争的斗争运动。
    号召书最后说：“越南南方妇女完全相信，依靠自己和全国三千一百万同胞的团结战斗精神，并且得到世界进步人民和妇女的同情和支持，我们一定能够取得最后胜利。”（附图片）
