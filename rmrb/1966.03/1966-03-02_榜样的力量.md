    The Power of Example
    Zhao Xiang, Industrial and Communications Political Department, Lankao County CCP Committee

    In the winter of 1962, one evening after dinner, Comrade Tang Xuedian, then director of the Transportation Bureau, and I were passing by the county Party committee entrance. At that time, Comrade Jiao Yulu was taking a walk. When he saw us, he warmly shook our hands and asked us about many things, from our work to our lives. Finally, he said kindly, "Are there any difficulties at work?" This simple conversation gave me a very good impression of this unfamiliar secretary: "He is conscientious and responsible in his work, and warmly cares for his comrades."

    Since Comrade Jiao Yulu was transferred to Lankao, he often said, "Communist Party members should care about the lives of the people, understand their hardships, and rely on and mobilize the masses no matter what problems they deal with or what work they do." His teachings gave me immense strength.

    In June 1963, a disaster occurred in the Nanzhang and Zhangjunmu communes, and the grain reserves were almost exhausted. It was necessary to transport 1.2 million jin of grain from the county within five days to supply the disaster victims. However, at that time, it was raining continuously and the roads were muddy, making it very difficult to complete the task. At this critical moment, I remembered what Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "Communist Party members should appear in front of the masses when they are in the most difficult situation." I immediately mobilized the masses, organized 11 trucks, 38 horse-drawn carts, and more than 800 handcarts, and established a transportation headquarters. I conveyed Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions to the comrades participating in the transportation: "Not only must we complete the transportation task on time, but we must also cherish state property and not lose a single grain of food."

    During the transportation process, the comrades displayed the spirit of enduring great hardship and hard work. Driver Zheng Shiqi used his hands to pull the mud off the tires, moving the wheels forward little by little to open up a path. The porters helped each other, speeding up transportation on the muddy roads. In order to "not lose a single grain of food," the comrades preferred to get soaked in the rain themselves and take off their clothes to cover the grain. When sacks were torn, they used mud to patch the holes. Because we mobilized the masses and relied on the masses, we successfully completed the task within five days.

    In May 1965, the Yellow River collapsed, and the dike of Hanzhuang Village in Zhuaying Commune was only three meters away from the water level, facing the danger of collapse. After receiving the emergency task of rescue, I immediately organized the First and Second Fleets of the Kaifeng Transportation Company and the County Automobile Team, a total of 15 vehicles and 37 people, to go to the dangerous area to transport the property of the masses. In the rescue process, in order to prevent the property of the masses from being lost, the drivers drove the cars day and night, and if they were sleepy, they washed their faces with cold water and continued to work. They didn't even leave the cab to drink water. The masses stood by the road and shouted, "Drivers, you have worked hard, have a bowl of boiled water!" The drivers waved their hands and said, "A bowl of cold water is fine, you have difficulty burning firewood now!" After two days and two nights, the entire village, with a total of 180 people and 100 houses, from trees and bricks to household sundries, was moved to a safe place. After the rescue, the masses said with emotion: "In the past, when the Yellow River collapsed, the reactionary government not only did not care, but also came to rob our property. Now that the Yellow River has collapsed, the people's government has sent cadres and cars to help us move. This is thanks to the good leadership of Chairman Mao. We must produce more grain to support national construction."

    In the autumn of 1964, it rained continuously for more than 70 days, causing an unprecedented flood. The county Party committee instructed me to go to Zhuaying Commune to carry out rush harvesting and planting. I and the other five comrades of the work group studied the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Jiao Yulu and, in ten days, waded through the water and mud and walked through the fields and poor and lower-middle peasant families of more than 80 production teams to understand the production and living conditions of the masses. At that time, it was discovered that the flour mills and engines of the Guying, Suzhuang, Batou, and Zhuaying brigades were damaged and could not be started. Most of the masses could not devote themselves to rush harvesting and planting because they were grinding flour by hand. I rushed from Guying, which was more than 40 li away from the county seat, to the county in the dark of night, and immediately organized three mechanical repair groups to go to the countryside to carry out rush repairs day and night. Within three days, more than ten flour mills and engines were repaired, solving the problem of grinding flour for the masses of 47 production teams, freeing up more than 340 laborers to devote themselves to rush harvesting and planting, and accelerating the progress of the three autumn harvests.

    In recent years, thanks to the education of the Party and the inspiration of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have made some achievements in my work. However, compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, there is still a big gap. I have not studied and applied Chairman Mao's works as flexibly as he did; I have not worked as hard and practically as he did; I have not lived as frugally as he did. In the future, I am determined to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example and contribute everything I have to completely change the face of Lankao.

    榜样的力量
    中共兰考县工交政治部  赵翔
    一九六二年冬，一天晚饭后，我和前交通局长唐学典同志路过县委会门口，这时焦裕禄同志正在散步，他看见我们，热情地和我们握手，他从工作到生活问了我们许多事情，最后他亲切地说：“工作上有没有困难？……”简单的交谈，使我对这位陌生的书记有了一个非常好的印象：“对工作认真负责，对同志热情关怀。”
    自从焦裕禄同志调到兰考后，他经常说：“共产党员要关心人民群众的生活，体贴群众的疾苦，无论处理什么问题，做什么工作，都要依靠群众，发动群众。”他的教导给了我莫大的力量。
    一九六三年六月，南彰、张君墓两个公社发生了灾荒，库存粮食已近用完，需要在五天之内从县里运送一百二十万斤粮食供应灾民。但这时阴雨连绵，道路泥泞，要完成任务有很大困难。在这紧要关头，我想起了焦裕禄同志说的：“共产党员应该在群众最困难的时候，出现在群众面前。”当时立即发动群众，组织汽车十一辆，马车三十八辆，架子车八百多辆，成立了运输指挥部。我向参加运输的同志传达了焦裕禄同志的指示：“不但要按时完成运输任务，而且要爱护国家财产，不能损失一粒粮食。”
    在运输过程中，同志们发扬了吃大苦耐大劳的精神，司机郑士奇用手扒掉轮胎上的烂泥，车轮一点一点向前移动，打开通路。搬运工人互相帮助，在泥泞的道路上，加速运输。为了“不损失一粒粮食”，工人同志宁可自己淋雨脱下衣服盖住粮食，麻袋破了，他们用泥糊住破口。由于发动群众，依靠群众，在五天内顺利完成任务。
    一九六五年五月，黄河坍塌，爪营公社韩庄村的大堤离水位只有三米，眼看就有坍塌的危险。当我接到抢险的紧急任务以后，立即组织开封运输公司一、二车队、县汽车队三个单位，共十五辆汽车，三十七人前往险地抢运群众的财产。在抢救过程中，为了使群众财产不受损失，司机同志昼夜不停地开动汽车，困了用凉水洗洗脸，继续坚持工作。连喝水也不出驾驶室。群众站在路边喊道：“司机同志，你们辛苦了，喝碗开水吧！”司机挥挥手说：“喝碗凉水行啦，现在你们烧柴困难啊！”经过两天两夜时间，把这个共有一百八十口人、一百间房屋的村庄，从树木、砖瓦和家用杂物，全部移到了安全地方。抢险结束后，群众感动地说：“过去黄河坍塌、反动政府不但不管，还来抢我们的财物，现在黄河坍塌，人民政府派干部、汽车来帮助我们转移，这是毛主席领导的好。我们一定多打粮食，支援国家建设”。
    一九六四年秋季，连续下了七十多天大雨，造成多年未有的内涝。县委指示我到爪营公社搞抢收抢种工作。我和工作组其他五个同志，学习焦裕禄同志的革命精神，十天内趟水跋泥走遍了八十多个生产队的田边地头和贫下中农家庭，了解群众的生产与生活情况。当时发现谷营、粟庄、坝头、爪营四个大队的面粉机、发动机损坏，不能开动，大部分群众因推磨而不能投入抢收抢种，我黑夜由离县城四十多里的谷营赶到县里，立即组织了三个机械修配组下乡，日夜进行抢修，在三天内修复了十多部面粉机、发动机，解决了四十七个生产队群众的推磨困难，腾出三百四十多个劳动力投入抢收抢种，加速了三秋工作的进行。
    几年来，由于党的教育，焦裕禄同志给我的启示，我在工作上取得了一些成绩。但是与焦裕禄同志相比还有很大的差距，我学习上还没有象他那样活学活用毛主席著作；工作上还没有象他那样苦干实干，深入细致；生活上还没有象他那样艰苦朴素。今后，我坚决要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，为彻底改变兰考面貌贡献出自己的一切。
