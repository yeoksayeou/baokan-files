    Vice Premier Chen Yi Reaffirms at Lahore Civic Reception Welcoming Chairman Liu:
    China resolutely supports Pakistan in safeguarding national independence.
    The Kashmiri people's right to self-determination must be respected, and the Kashmiri people's struggle for national self-determination will surely be victorious.
    Chairman Liu Attends Civic Reception and Sino-Pak Friendship Association Luncheon in Lahore
    Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 29th - A civic reception was held here on the afternoon of the 29th to welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi. At the reception, amidst cheers, Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech, reaffirming the Chinese government and people's unwavering and unshakable principled stance of resolutely supporting the Pakistani people's struggle to safeguard national independence.
    Five thousand people attended the reception held by the Lahore Municipal Committee at the Shalimar Gardens on the outskirts of Lahore. Last year, this area was threatened by Indian aggressors, but the heroic Pakistani military and civilians ultimately repelled the invaders.
    When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese guests, accompanied by the Governor of West Pakistan, Malik Amir Mohammad Khan, and Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, arrived at the park, loud bugle calls rang out from the rooftops, and hundreds of female students scattered rose petals on the red-carpeted road.
    The Vice Chairman of the Lahore Municipal Committee, Muhammad Hussain, delivered a welcoming speech at the reception. He said, "We cannot find appropriate words to express the extremely pleasant feelings of the people of Lahore regarding your visit. The love of the people of Lahore for our Chinese brothers and their great and sincere leaders is difficult to express in appropriate words, if not impossible."
    He said, "The people of Pakistan are very grateful to the government of the People's Republic of China for its support of the right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, a right that both Pakistan and India have guaranteed to grant them." He said, "Today, as our hearts are filled with love for you as we welcome you, we are also proud to see that the sacrifices made by the leaders of the People's Republic of China for the prosperity, glory, and greatness of their people constitute a milestone in the history of human culture and civilization. Your sacrifices, your tireless efforts, and your noble struggles have greatly inspired the youth of emerging countries in Africa and Asia to move forward on the road to prosperity with new enthusiasm."
    In his speech (full text on page two), Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Lahore is a beautiful ancient cultural city and also a heroic city. He said, "When the Pakistani people rose up to resist Indian armed aggression last year, the people of Lahore stood at the forefront of the struggle. In the face of enemy invasion, you fought bravely, unafraid of sacrifice, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and heroism, and writing a glorious chapter in the history of the Pakistani people's struggle against aggression. Under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, the Pakistani people, united as one and sharing a common hatred of the enemy, defeated the strong with the weak and the many with the few, finally repelling the invaders and defending the independence and sovereignty of their motherland. Your victory shows that the people who fight for justice are invincible. On behalf of the Chinese people, I express my highest respect to the people of Lahore and all the people of Pakistan."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out, "Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The people in the Indian-occupied area of Kashmir are unwilling to endure cruel rule any longer and have launched a heroic struggle. This is only natural. As long as India does not stop its oppression, the Kashmiri people will not stop resisting. As President Ayub Khan pointed out, 'There can be no peace between India and Pakistan unless the Kashmir issue is resolved.' The Kashmiri people's right to self-determination must be respected. The Kashmiri people's just struggle for national self-determination will surely achieve final victory."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized, "Support is never one-sided. Our firm support for the just struggle of the Pakistani government and people against Indian armed aggression is our bounden duty." He also said that the Chinese government and people should thank the Pakistani government and people for their support to China in international affairs.
    He said that the Chinese people and the Pakistani people have forged a deep fighting friendship in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. This friendship is sincere and selfless and can stand the test of time.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause and deafening slogans of "Long live Sino-Pak friendship."
    After the speech, the Lahore Municipal Committee and the Chinese guests exchanged gifts. Many people crowded near the stage to see the Chinese national leaders with their own eyes. Chairman Liu and Vice Premier Chen Yi stood up and waved to them.
    The beautiful Shalimar Gardens was dressed in festive attire today. The Chinese and Urdu slogans "Long live Sino-Pak friendship" made of electric lights above the gate of the park shone brightly. As the motorcade of Chinese guests traveled to and from the park, tens of thousands of people stood densely on both sides of the road, enthusiastically cheering and waving to them.
    Attending the civic reception were Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Elahi, Speaker of the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly Muhammad Anwar, ministers of the West Pakistan Provincial Government, and well-known figures from all walks of life.
    Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and Pakistani Ambassador to China Roza also attended the civic reception.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 29th - The Pakistan-China Friendship Association of Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan Province, held a grand luncheon here on the afternoon of the 29th to entertain Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other members of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's entourage attended the luncheon.
    When Chairman Liu Shaoqi entered the banquet hall, the entire venue cheered and applauded enthusiastically. Huge banners written in Chinese and Pakistani languages ​​were hung in the banquet hall, which read:
    "May Sino-Pak friendship last forever!" "China is our best friend!" "Sino-Pak friendship is stronger than the atomic bomb!" "We are very grateful to China for supporting us against Indian aggression!"
    Mrs. J. A. Shahnawaz, President of the Lahore Pakistan-China Friendship Association, said before the luncheon that there had been contact between the people of China and Pakistan in ancient times, but this contact was interrupted due to the arrival of imperialism in Asia.
    She said, "The restoration of this connection in recent years has not only re-established the ancient connection, but also is a blow to colonialist and imperialist forces in Asia and Africa."
    She said, "The close relationship that our two countries have rebuilt in the past few years has greatly helped to strengthen friendship. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, people must 'discover the truth through practice.' Last September, we largely discovered this truth. When the roar of guns sounded twelve miles from where we are today, our eyes were brightened, and we clearly distinguished in our hearts who were our true friends and who were talking about friendship emptily. We will never forget the help and friendship that the People's Republic of China gave us in this difficult moment. The connection forged in this war is eternal."
    Mrs. Shahnawaz pointed out: "The war waged against us last year is now over. However, the great struggle of Asian countries against imperialism and neo-colonialism is not over."
    She continued: "In activities against the people of Asia and Africa, aggressive forces speak in many languages. To us, they use the sweet words of non-violence; in other parts of Asia, they speak in the name of peace, but in the final analysis, they only believe in using force."
    She said: "The war against these reactionary forces will not end until the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have achieved the right to self-determination; whether they are in Kashmir, or in Rhodesia, or in Vietnam. Until then, the people of Pakistan will not lay down their arms, and they will never compromise on their ideals and aspirations. In this regard, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Asian friends and brothers."
    In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The people of China and Pakistan cherish Sino-Pak friendship very much and are happy about the continuous growth of this noble friendship. But the imperialists and expansionists are afraid of the friendship between us and are trying every possible means to undermine it."
    He said: "The Chinese people will, as always, resolutely support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to safeguard national independence and oppose foreign aggression. Like the Pakistani people, we have always believed that the Kashmir issue can only be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people. We firmly believe that Sino-Pak friendly relations will continue to develop through the efforts of both sides. The friendly relations between our two peoples cannot be destroyed by any force."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi also said: "The Lahore Sino-Pak Friendship Association has made unremitting efforts to consolidate and strengthen the friendly relations between the two peoples." He said, "Your work is commendable. I am deeply convinced that the efforts you have made will surely achieve fruitful results."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi finally expressed his gratitude to the Pakistani government and people for supporting the Chinese government and people on many international issues.
    At the luncheon, the guests exchanged words of friendship with each other. The band played Chinese and Pakistani national music. The luncheon proceeded from beginning to end in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
    Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu also attended the luncheon.
    Among the more than 500 guests attending the luncheon were: Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, West Pakistan Provincial Governor Malik Amir Muhammad Khan, and Pakistani Ambassador to China Roza.

    陈毅副总理在拉合尔市民欢迎刘主席的招待会上重申
    中国坚决支持巴基斯坦维护民族独立
    克什米尔人民自决权利必须得到尊重，克什米尔人民争取民族自决的斗争一定会胜利
    刘主席出席拉合尔的市民招待会和巴中友协午宴
    新华社拉合尔二十九日电二十九日下午在这里举行市民招待会，欢迎刘少奇主席。会上，陈毅副总理在一片欢呼声中讲话，重申中国政府和人民坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立的斗争，这一原则立场是坚定不移的，是不可动摇的。
    有五千人参加了拉合尔市政委员会在拉合尔近郊的夏利马尔公园举行的这一招待会。去年这个地方曾经受到印度侵略者的威胁，但是英勇的巴基斯坦军民终于击退了侵略者。
    当刘少奇主席和夫人，陈毅副总理和夫人，外交部副部长章汉夫和其他中国客人在西巴基斯坦省督马利克·阿密尔
  ·穆罕默德·汗和外交部长布托和夫人的陪同下到达公园的时候，屋顶上响起了嘹亮的号角声，数百名女学生把玫瑰花瓣撒在铺着红地毯的路上。
    拉合尔市政委员会副主席穆罕默德·侯赛因在招待会上致欢迎词。他说：“我们找不到适当的词句来表达拉合尔人民对你这次访问所感到的极其愉快的心情。拉合尔人民对我们的中国兄弟和他们的伟大诚恳的领袖们的热爱，是很难找到适当的词句来表达的，如果不是根本不可能找到的话。”
    他说：“巴基斯坦人民非常感激中华人民共和国政府对查谟和克什米尔邦人民自决权利的支持，这种权利是巴基斯坦和印度都保证要给予他们的。”他说：“今天当我们的内心充满着对你的热爱来欢迎你的时候，我们也引以自豪地看到，中华人民共和国的领袖们为他们人民的繁荣、光荣和伟大而作出的牺牲构成了人类文化和文明史上的一个里程碑。你们的牺牲，你们的不倦的努力和你们的崇高的斗争极大地鼓舞了非洲和亚洲新兴国家的青年以新的热忱向繁荣的道路上前进。”
    陈毅副总理在讲话（全文见第二版）中说，拉合尔是一个美丽的文化古城，又是一座英雄的城市。他说：“去年巴基斯坦人民奋起抵抗印度武装侵略的时候，拉合尔人民站在斗争的最前线。你们在强敌侵犯的情况下，奋勇抗战，不怕牺牲，表现了高度的爱国主义精神和英雄气概，为巴基斯坦人民反抗侵略的斗争史写下了光辉的篇章。巴基斯坦人民在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，万众一心，同仇敌忾，以弱胜强，以少胜多，终于击退了侵略者，捍卫了祖国的独立和主权。你们的胜利表明，为正义而斗争的人民是不可战胜的。我代表中国人民向拉合尔人民和全体巴基斯坦人民表示崇高的敬意。”
    陈毅副总理指出：“那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。克什米尔印占区人民不愿意再忍受残酷的统治，掀起了英勇的斗争。这是理所当然的。印度一天不停止压迫，克什米尔人民就一天不会停止反抗。正如阿尤布·汗总统所指出的，‘除非克什米尔问题得到解决，否则印巴之间就不可能有和平’。克什米尔人民的自决权利必须得到尊重。克什米尔人民争取民族自决的正义斗争，是一定会取得最后胜利的。”
    陈毅副总理强调指出：“支持从来不是单方面的。我们坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反抗印度武装侵略的正义斗争，是我们应尽的义务。”他又说，中国政府和人民应该感谢巴基斯坦政府和人民在国际事务中对中国的支持。
    他说，中国人民和巴基斯坦人民，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。这种友谊是真诚无私的，是经得起考验的。
    陈毅副总理的讲话一再为雷鸣般的掌声和响彻云霄的
  “中巴友谊万岁”的口号声所打断。
    讲话后，拉合尔市政委员会和中国客人相互赠送了礼物。许多人挤到讲台附近，去亲眼看看中国国家领导人。刘主席和陈毅副总理站起来向他们挥手致意。
    美丽的夏利马尔公园今天披上了节日盛装。公园大门上面用电灯组成的中文和乌尔都文标语“中巴友谊万岁”大放光彩。当中国客人的车队往返公园时，数以万计的群众密密层层地站在马路两旁向他们热情欢呼和招手。
    出席市民招待会的有国民议会副议长埃拉希、西巴基斯坦省议会议长穆罕默德·安瓦尔、西巴基斯坦省政府的部长以及当地各界知名人士。
    中国驻巴基斯坦大使丁国钰和巴基斯坦驻中国大使罗查也出席了市民招待会。
    新华社拉合尔二十九日电西巴基斯坦省首府拉合尔的巴基斯坦—中国友好协会二十九日下午在这里举行盛大午宴，招待刘少奇主席。
    刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理兼外交部长和夫人、外交部副部长章汉夫以及刘少奇主席的其他随行人员出席了午宴。
    当刘少奇主席走进宴会厅时，全场热烈欢呼鼓掌。宴会厅内悬挂着用中文和巴基斯坦文字写的巨大横幅，上面写着：
  “巴中友谊万古长青！”“中国是我们最好的朋友！”“巴中友谊比原子弹还强大！”“我们非常感谢中国支持我们反对印度侵略！”
    拉合尔巴基斯坦—中国友好协会主席贾·阿·夏纳瓦兹夫人在午宴前讲话说，巴中两国人民之间在古时就有联系，只是由于帝国主义来到亚洲，这种联系才中断了。
    她说：“近年来这种联系的恢复不仅使古时的联系重新建立起来，而且是对在亚非的殖民主义和帝国主义势力的打击。”
    她说：“我们两国在过去几年中重建的亲切关系，大大有助于加强友谊。正如毛泽东主席所说，人们必须‘通过实践而发现真理’。去年九月，我们在很大的程度上发现了这个真理。当离我们今天所在地十二英里的地方响起隆隆的枪炮声的时候，我们的眼睛擦亮了，我们心里鲜明地分清了谁是我们真正的朋友和谁是空谈友谊的人。我们决不会忘记，在这个困难的时刻，中华人民共和国给予我们的帮助和友谊，在这场战火中结成的联系是永恒不变的。”
    夏纳瓦兹夫人指出：“去年对我们发动的战争现在已经结束。但是，亚洲反对帝国主义和新殖民主义的伟大斗争还没有结束。”
    她接着说：“在反对亚非人民的活动中，侵略势力是用多种语言讲话的。对我们，他们使用非暴力的甜言蜜语；在亚洲的其他地区，他们用和平的名义讲话，但是归根到底，他们只相信使用武力。”
    她说：“在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民取得自决权利之前，反对这些反动势力的战争是不会结束的；不论他们是在克什米尔，或在罗得西亚，或者是在越南。直到那时，巴基斯坦人民不会放下武器，他们决不会在他们的理想和愿望方面进行妥协。在这方面，我们同亚洲的朋友们和弟兄们肩并肩地站在一起。”
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说：“中巴两国人民都非常珍视中巴友好，并且为这种崇高友谊的不断增长而感到高兴。但是帝国主义者和扩张主义者害怕我们之间的友谊，千方百计地企图破坏。”
    他说：“中国人民也将一如既往地坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、反对外来侵略的正义斗争。我们同巴基斯坦人民一样，一贯认为，克什米尔问题只有按照克什米尔人民的愿望才能解决。我们深信：中巴友好关系通过双方努力，将会继续发展。我们两国人民的友好关系是任何力量破坏不了的。”
    陈毅副总理还说：“拉合尔巴中友好协会为巩固和加强两国人民的友好关系进行了不懈的努力。”他说：“你们的工作是值得赞扬的。我深信，你们所作的努力，必将取得丰硕的成果。”
    陈毅副总理最后表示感谢巴基斯坦政府和人民在许多国际问题上支持中国政府和人民。
    在午宴上，宾主们互相畅叙友谊。乐队高奏中国和巴基斯坦民族音乐。午宴自始至终是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的。
    中国驻巴基斯坦大使丁国钰也出席了午宴。
    出席午宴的五百多位客人中还有：巴基斯坦外交部长布托和夫人、西巴基斯坦省省督马利克·阿密尔·穆罕默德·汗和巴基斯坦驻中国大使罗查。
