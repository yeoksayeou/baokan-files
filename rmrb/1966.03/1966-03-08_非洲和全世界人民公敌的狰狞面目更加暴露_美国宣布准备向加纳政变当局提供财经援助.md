    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th - Washington News: The U.S. government officially announced that it "is studying" providing financial and economic assistance to the Ghana coup authorities.
    U.S. State Department spokesman Wright said on the 5th: Ankrah, head of Ghana's "National Liberation Council," "has publicly stated that he is seeking foreign aid from various parties, has already contacted us, and we are studying this request."
    On the same day, Agence France-Presse quoted "reliable sources" in Washington as saying that the "International Monetary Fund," controlled by the United States, is also "considering" the request for financial assistance made to it by the Ghana coup authorities.
    Ankrah, head of the Ghana coup authorities, announced in a national broadcast on the evening of the 2nd that Ghana would soon continue negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund" and the World Bank, "with the aim of obtaining financial and economic assistance."
    He stated that the Ghana "National Liberation Council" would fulfill its obligations to the U.S. investment in Ghana's Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO) and would provide "all assistance" to this U.S. company.
    In the same broadcast, Ankrah also said that all existing Ghanaian state-owned companies would be studied as a matter of urgency, and some of these companies would be transformed into private companies. The private sector in the Ghanaian economy would be "open to Ghanaians and non-Ghanaians."
    He pointed out that the coup authorities "have no plans for nationalization" and "will strive to finally abolish population controls in the economic sphere."
    The day after Ankrah's broadcast, Omah, chairman of the economic committee of the Ghana coup authorities, revealed that it urgently needed a loan of about 15 million pounds. He said that the heads of the "International Monetary Fund" and the World Bank would soon come to Ghana.

    非洲和全世界人民公敌的狰狞面目更加暴露
    美国宣布准备向加纳政变当局提供财经援助
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方宣布，美国政府“正在研究”向加纳政变当局提供财政、经济援助。
    美国国务院发言人赖特五日说：加纳“全国解放委员会”首脑安克拉“已经公开表示向若干方面寻求外援，已经同我们进行了接洽，我们正在研究这个要求”。
    同一天，法新社引用华盛顿“可靠人士”的话说，美国控制的“国际货币基金”组织也“正在考虑”加纳政变当局向它提出的给予财政援助的要求。
    加纳政变当局首脑安克拉二日晚上在向全国广播讲话中曾宣布，加纳不久将同“国际货币基金”组织和世界银行继续谈判，“目的是得到财政、经济援助”。
    他表示，加纳“全国解放委员会”将履行它对美国在加纳投资的沃尔特铝公司的义务，并将向这个美国公司提供“一切帮助”。
    安克拉在同一次广播讲话中还说：所有现存的加纳国营公司将被作为一个紧迫问题予以研究，其中一些公司将改变成私营。加纳经济中的私营部分将向“加纳人和非加纳人开放”。
    他指出，政变当局“没有国有化的计划”，并“将努力来最后废除在经济方面的人口控制”。
    在安克拉广播讲话的第二天，加纳政变当局的经济委员会主席奥马布透露，它急需大约一千五百万英镑的贷款。他说，“国际货币基金”组织和世界银行的负责人不久即将前来加纳。
    美国报纸继续为加纳军事政变叫好。
    《纽约邮报》一日和二日接连刊登文章，说政变是“美国的一个巨大胜利”，并且夸奖政变头子说，他们的头一批行动和言论引起了“希望”。
