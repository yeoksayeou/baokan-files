    A Few Words
    One Master, Two Servants
    According to a report by United Press International, Indian and Japanese officials held talks in New Delhi to strengthen their "cooperation" and "contain" China. U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Reischauer, also arrived in New Delhi for a "visit" at this time. Indian and Japanese officials both believed that "his arrival in India during the talks proves that the United States is concerned about the issue of strengthening cooperation between India and Japan."
    Thus, the roles in this play of "one master, two servants" are complete. And the plot is also very clear.
    Words from the Heart
    The Bonn authorities have admitted that Nazi organizations and groups in West Germany have developed rapidly over the past year, not only increasing in membership but also becoming increasingly rampant in their activities. They are carrying out increasingly frequent acts of terror such as arson, destruction, insults, and threats. However, West German Interior Minister Luecke said that these situations "do not pose a real danger."
    Luecke has his reasons for saying this. For the West German militarist forces, who are bent on following Hitler's old path, how could the continuous expansion of Nazi organizations be a "danger"? On the contrary, they feel more and more secure because of it.

    三言两语
    一主二仆
    据合众国际社报道，印度和日本的官员在新德里会谈加强两国“合作”，“遏制”中国的问题。美国驻日本大使赖肖尔在这个时候也到了新德里“访问”。印度和日本官员都认为，“在会谈期间他到印度来，证明美国关心印日加强合作的问题。”
    这样，这出“一主二仆”的戏，就角色齐全了。而且剧情也清楚得很。
    由衷之言
    波恩当局承认，西德纳粹组织和团体一年来有迅速发展，不仅成员激增，而且活动也越来越猖獗。他们日益频繁地进行放火、破坏、侮辱、威胁等恐怖行动。但是，西德内政部长吕克却说，这些情况“没有实际的危险。”
    吕克这样说，也有他的道理。纳粹组织的不断扩大，对于一心想要重走希特勒老路的西德军国主义势力来说，哪里会有什么“危险”？恰恰相反，他们因此而感到越来越保险哩。
