    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: As revealed in the February issue of the Japanese magazine "Keizai" (Economy), the Sato government's policy of continuously raising prices has seriously affected the lives of the Japanese people.

    The magazine stated that a housewife complained: "My monthly income is 12,000 yen, and I have to support two children. I don't have money to buy non-staple food, so I rely on rice to raise my children. To make sure my children can eat three bowls of rice per meal, I have to endure hunger and eat one bowl of rice myself. Now, rice prices are soaring, this is taking our lives!"

    The magazine said that this housewife's words incisively revealed that the Sato government's high-price policy fundamentally undermines the lives of the working people.

    The magazine pointed out that due to rising prices year after year, most working-class families are deeply in debt. The year before last, families with a monthly income of 35,000 yen were already in deficit; last year, families with a monthly income of 50,000 yen were also in deficit, and the deficit is growing. Due to rising prices and insufficient income, many workers are forced to skip lunch. A committee member of a journalists' union said, "The number of workers who skip lunch is increasing so rapidly that it is alarming."

    The magazine also said that many working people's children are also suffering from malnutrition.

    The magazine said that, on the contrary, the labor intensity of workers continues to increase. Increased labor intensity, deteriorating working environment, deteriorating social environment, and long-term soaring prices make the Japanese working people feel increasingly insecure about their future lives.

    According to Japanese newspapers, the Sato government, on the basis of raising retail rice prices by 16.2 percent last year, raised rice prices by another 8.6 percent from New Year's Day. It also increased the fares of private railways and state-owned railways by 23.3 percent and 25 percent respectively. In addition, it will also increase telegram and telephone charges, postage, and rents for state-owned real estate by more than 20 percent.

    According to Japanese newspaper statistics, the Japanese authorities can exploit 60 billion yen from the Japanese people simply by raising rice prices, and another 37 billion yen from raising postage.

    Some bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that since the Sato government came to power, price increases have been like kites with broken strings. Other newspapers said that the Sato government is a "price-raising government."

    "Mainichi Weekly" recently asked Japanese workers, farmers, clerks, doctors, actors, students, and small handicraftsmen for their opinions under the title "How Will Life Be in 1966?" All 24 people who responded to this magazine believed that 1966 would be a very difficult year. Yamagishi Suejiro, a meteorologist from Kochi Prefecture, said that 1966 "has something more terrifying than a typhoon, and that is rising prices, the government issuing bonds, and inflation." Others said that the heavy burden of prices and taxes is suffocating. (Attached picture)

    佐藤政府的经济掠夺政策激起民愤
    日本人民谴责佐藤政府是涨价政府
    一位家庭主妇控诉说：米价一股劲地上涨，这是要我们的命！
    据新华社讯　东京消息：据二月号的日本《经济》杂志揭露，佐藤政府不断提高物价的政策，严重地影响了日本人民的生活。
    杂志说，一位家庭主妇控诉道：“我每月收入一万二千日元，扶养两个孩子，没有钱买副食，靠米饭把孩子养大。为了使孩子每顿能吃三碗饭，我只好忍着饿吃一碗饭。现在，一股劲地提高米价，这是要我们的命！”
    杂志说，这位家庭主妇的话，一语道破了佐藤政府的高物价政策，从根本上破坏了劳动人民的生活。
    杂志指出，由于物价连年上涨，大部分劳动人民的家庭都负债累累。前年，月收入三万五千日元的家庭，都有亏空；去年，月收入五万日元的家庭，也都有亏空了，而且，亏空越来越大。由于物价上涨，收入不够，许多工人被迫不吃午饭。一位新闻工会的委员说，“不吃午饭的工人人数增加之快，已经到了使人吃惊的程度。”
    杂志还说，许多劳动人民的孩子也都患着营养不良症。
    杂志说，与此相反，工人的劳动强度却不断增加。劳动强度增加、劳动环境恶化、社会环境恶化等等，再加上长期的物价猛涨，使日本劳动人民对今后的生活越来越感到不安了。
    据日本报刊报道，佐藤政府在去年提高零售米价百分之十六点二的基础上，又从元旦起把米价提高了百分之八点六。并把私营铁路和国营铁路的运费分别提高百分之二十三点三和百分之二十五。除此以外，还要把电报电话费、邮费、国有房产的房租等都提高百分之二十以上。
    据日本报刊统计，日本当局只是从提高米价中就可以在日本人民身上剥削到六百亿日元，从提高邮费中又可以剥削到三百七十亿日元。
    一些资产阶级报刊不得不承认，佐藤政府上台以来，物价上涨象是断了线的风筝。还有的报纸说，佐藤政府是“涨价政府”。
    《每日周刊》不久前以《一九六六年的生活将会怎样》为题，征求了日本工人、农民、职员、医生、演员、学生以及小手工业者的意见。向这家刊物提出答复的二十四个人，都认为一九六六年是日子非常不好过的一年。高知县的一位气象工作者山岸末二郎说，一九六六年“有比台风更可怕的东西，那就是物价上涨，政府发行公债，通货膨胀”。还有人说，沉重的物价和捐税等负担压迫得人喘不出气来。（附图片）
