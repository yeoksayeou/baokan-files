    How to Achieve "Completely" and "Thoroughly" Serve the People
    Wu Yuqi
    Editor's Note: Comrade Wu Yuqi, political instructor of a radio company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, is an outstanding political cadre who uses Chairman Mao's works as the basic teaching material for political classes. In order to promote Comrade Wu Yuqi's teaching experience, the Air Force Political Department recently held a demonstration teaching meeting in Beijing. At the demonstration teaching meeting, Comrade Wu Yuqi lectured on the articles "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to an engineering company of a certain unit. The characteristics of his lectures are: deep class feelings, clear viewpoints, prominent key points, connection with reality, and vivid language. Here is a portion of Comrade Wu Yuqi's lecture on "Serve the People."
    Establish a View of Life and Death: Living for the Revolution, Dying for the Revolution
    To completely and thoroughly serve the people, we must establish a view of life and death: living for the revolution, dying for the revolution.
    Chairman Mao said: "All men must die, but death can vary in its significance. The ancient Chinese writer Szuma Chien said, 'Though death befalls all men, it may be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather.' To die for the people is heavier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather." He also said: "To make revolution, there will be sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. But thinking of the interests of the people and of the sufferings of the great majority, we die for the people, and our death is worthy. Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices."
    This is Chairman Mao's important thesis on the question of life and death. How should we understand it? In summary, it should be that living is for working for the interests of the people, and dying is also for the interests of the people. This is the life of a revolutionary who completely and thoroughly serves the people.
    Specifically, we must understand it from the following four points.
    First, the attitude towards the question of life and death is an important marker to distinguish between true and false revolution. Whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, whether they serve the people wholeheartedly or hypocritically, must be tested in many ways. But when the revolution requires us to bravely dedicate ourselves, it is the most rigorous test among all the tests. In the face of this test, there is no room for ambiguity between being a proletarian hard bone or a cowardly wretch afraid of death. Therefore, only by establishing a revolutionary worldview of living for the revolution and dying for the revolution, and being ready to dedicate ourselves to the revolution at any time, can we reach the highest level of completely and thoroughly serving the people. Our Party is a revolutionary party, our army is a revolutionary army, and if we want revolution, we will not be afraid of necessary sacrifices.
    Second, revolutionary martyrs and heroes are our role models.
    In the long years of revolutionary war in the past, and in today's socialist revolution and socialist construction, countless revolutionary martyrs and heroes have set brilliant examples for us on the question of life and death. Here I would like to talk about three situations:
    The first type of people, they showed unyielding spirit under the enemy's butcher knives.
    Take the martyr Liu Hulan as an example. On January 12, 1947, before her execution, Liu Hulan glared fiercely at the enemy and shouted at the Yan bandit officer: "How am I going to die!" Two vicious enemies said: "The same way." Liu Hulan then walked to the guillotine with her head held high and died heroically. She was only fifteen years old at the time, but she showed the noble qualities of a Communist Party member, unyielding in the face of the enemy. Just as Chairman Mao wrote in his own handwriting, she was "born great, died gloriously."
    Then there is the martyr Xia Minghan. Before his execution, the murderer asked him what he wanted to say, and he wrote: "It doesn't matter if my head is chopped off, as long as the doctrine is true. After Xia Minghan is killed, there will be successors." Comrades, who are the successors? The successors are us. So, what should we do as successors? Chairman Mao said: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed themselves heroically before us for the interests of the people. Let us hold high their banners and advance along their bloody footprints!" Everyone may know that the parents of Lin Yusheng in the play "The Younger Generation" left a blood letter that read: "My dear child, the executioners have raised their murderous guns and knives, and the comrades are singing loudly. We are about to go to the execution ground, and from now on you will never see your parents again. Child, I am writing this letter to you to remind you: your parents are both workers, and we have dedicated our lives to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. You can forget your father, you can forget your mother, but you must never forget that there are class enemies in this world! You must fight for the noble communist ideal! My child, hold the red flag high, advance forever, make revolution forever, be forever loyal to the Party, and be forever for the people. The time has come, the prison door is ringing, the executioners are coming, goodbye, dear child, we are leaving, you must not forget your roots, do not forget your roots!" Comrades, as successors, we must never forget our roots!
    The second type of people, some revolutionary heroes, with a high degree of class hatred, charged into battle on the battlefield for the revolution. Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to blow up the pillbox, Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the enemy's machine gun, Yang Gensi pulled the detonator and died with the enemy, and so on. Everyone is very familiar with the deeds of these heroes. Currently, we are learning from the heroic deeds of steel fighter Mai Xiande. As everyone knows, in the naval battle of August 6 last year, Comrade Mai Xiande, with a severe head injury and mental confusion, did not put his own life and safety in his heart at all. He was only thinking of eliminating the enemy, and insisted on his combat post until the victory of the battle. This revolutionary spirit of the proletarian hard bone is a good example for us to learn from.
    The third type of people, when the lives and property of the people of the motherland are in danger, they step forward and regard death as home. The great communist fighter Wang Jie is like this. On July 14 last year, he was helping the people's commune train militiamen. When an accidental explosion occurred, he heroically dedicated his life to protect the militiamen and people's armed cadres present. Everyone also knows about the martyr Ouyang Hai. He sacrificed himself heroically to rescue a train carrying five hundred passengers. He used his actual actions to realize his vow before his death: "If we need to sacrifice for the communist ideal, each of us should and can do it—without changing our face and without our hearts skipping a beat."
    The above three situations show that they are all people who are not afraid of death, the bravest people. If a revolutionary is not even afraid of death, then there is nothing in the world that makes him afraid.
    But there is also a kind of death that is lighter than a feather. Chairman Mao said: "To work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather." Like Pu Zhigao in "Red Rock" and Wang Jinbiao in the movie "Honghu Red Guards," they betrayed Sister Jiang, Xu Yunfeng, and Han Ying in order to save their own lives and became traitors to the revolution. In fact, these people do not have a good end. Pu Zhigao was not shot by the old woman with the double guns, and their death is lighter than a feather and stinks more than dung, leaving a bad name for ten thousand years.
    Third, regarding death as home for the revolution is not accidental.
    It is not accidental that a person can bravely sacrifice himself when the revolution needs it, nor is it a temporary impulse, but the highest manifestation of the noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people, and this noble quality is cultivated little by little in peacetime. It is inconceivable that a person who lives for himself and is afraid of suffering losses in everything can shed his head and spill blood for the people. Therefore, only by having no selfishness can one be the bravest.
    The reason why heroes can do heroic deeds is that they usually study Mao Zedong Thought hard, regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions, dig out their selfishness little by little, and improve their class consciousness year after year. To illustrate this point, let's take a look at what Wang Jie said in his diary. He wrote: "Be loyal to the Party's cause and bravely sacrifice for the victory of the revolution. As a Communist Party member, how can I not regard death as home? As a revolutionary soldier, how can I care about personal safety?" He wrote: "Once the motherland needs it, I will resolutely respond to the call of the motherland... I would be willing to die for the suffering people, and I would never change my mind even if I went up the mountain of knives or into the sea of fire." He also wrote: "As long as it is truly needed, when it comes to sacrifice, what the revolutionary thinks of is not fear, but to strive to exchange it for greater victory." We can also look at Wang Jie's usual actions, where it is most difficult and dangerous, he steps forward and takes the lead. During construction, he climbed high, drilled through small holes, and drilled blasting holes on the dome. He was the one who rushed to eliminate duds, and he was also the first to jump into the icy water to build a bridge in winter; he was also the one who took the lead in exploring the road in the water during the fight against floods. From what Wang Jie said and did, it can be seen that he usually paid great attention to cultivating and establishing a world view of wholeheartedly serving the people, and truly achieved consistency between words and deeds. His heroic sacrifice is the highest manifestation of his great revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of hardship and not being afraid of death for the benefit of the people.
    Fourth, how to correctly understand Chairman Mao's saying that "we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices"? I think that a revolutionary soldier should bravely dedicate his life when the interests of the revolution and the interests of the people need it, which is no doubt. But it does not mean that there is no need to cherish one's own life. To give an example, if some comrades are trying to show off their skills in construction, do not follow the operating procedures, do not pay attention to safety, and cause accidents, then it is wrong. This is not in line with the interests of the revolution, and therefore it is not true bravery.
    We must have a dialectical view of the question of life and death. When fighting, we pay attention to tactics in order to eliminate the enemy. In peacetime, we exercise our bodies in order to do a better job of revolution. This is fundamentally different from being greedy for life and afraid of death. To illustrate this point, I would like to talk about a dialogue in the book "Wang Ruofei in Prison," which may be enlightening to us.
    We know that Comrade Wang Ruofei spent five years and seven months in prison, and he set a brilliant example for us in the struggle against the enemy. Once, a fellow prisoner asked him: "Mr. Huang (pseudonym Huang Jingzhai), I heard that your case is very serious, how come you are always so cheerful and not worried at all?" Comrade Wang Ruofei replied: "What I am doing is not something to worry about. As for whether I can get out of prison, what's the use of worrying! If I worry myself sick, even if I get out, I will become useless, wouldn't that be even worse?"
    At that time, an elderly fellow prisoner asked again: "There is one thing I don't understand: when you were fighting the lawsuit, you scolded the Kuomintang, scolded Chiang Kai-shek, you were not afraid of heaven or earth, you were not even afraid of death, you risked your life, you are really a good man; but, sitting in prison, you still practice exercises every day, you practice day and night, and you seem to cherish your body very much, what exactly is going on?"
    Comrade Wang Ruofei smiled when he heard the question, he said: "It's very simple: I am not afraid of death because the enemy wants to harm our truth, and I must desperately protect our truth; I cherish my body because with a healthy body, I can more powerfully defend our truth. I live for the truth, and I die for the truth, and besides the truth, there is nothing of my own."
    The fellow prisoner asked again: "If the reactionaries kill you tomorrow, wouldn't your cherishing your body today be in vain?" He replied: "Even if the enemy kills me in the next moment, I will still cherish my body in this moment. I live in this world not for the enemy, but for our cause. I am not waiting to be killed by the enemy, but to kill the enemy. We and they are mortal enemies. Why should we act according to its requirements?"
    We must be like Comrade Wang Ruofei, living for the benefit of the people and dying for the benefit of the people. This is what it means to be born great and die gloriously.
            Do Whatever the Party Tells You to Do Well
    Doing whatever the Party tells you to do well is a concrete manifestation of wholeheartedly serving the people. Comrade Wang Jie said it well: To serve the people honestly and be a good servant of the people, there is no other trick or shortcut, the only one is to listen to Chairman Mao and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao taught us that serving the people should be "completely" and "thoroughly," which means that serving the people is not conditional, but unconditional. To achieve this, we must constantly fight against selfishness. As everyone knows, imperialism still exists in the world, class and class struggle still exist in socialist society, and there are still many non-proletarian ideas in our minds. Under such circumstances, we must pay special attention to ideological transformation and dig out selfishness little by little.
    What is selfishness? It is individualism. Its manifestation is: taking "I" as the center, and the so-called fame, fortune, status, etc. of individuals as the radius, drawing and drawing cannot run out of the small circle of individualism. This is the thought of the bourgeoisie, and it is incompatible with the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. In the mind of every person, the struggle between the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people and the thought of individualism is also a serious class struggle, a struggle between two worldviews. Therefore, Chairman Mao always taught us: "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed." We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, constantly and consciously transform our thinking, dig out our selfishness little by little, do whatever the Party tells us to do well, and "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people.
    Comrade Wang Jie said: "In our country, no matter what job you do, as long as you can wholeheartedly serve the people, you can make a name for yourself." This is indeed the case, even a worker who empties dung can become a national model worker and also see Chairman Mao. Some comrades have heard the report of the sanitation worker Shi Chuanxiang, didn't he become a nationally famous labor model and a National People's Congress representative? I remember Chairman Liu once said this to Comrade Shi Chuanxiang: "You and I, Lao Shi, are the same, we are both servants of the people. You are a servant of the people as a sanitation worker, and I am also a servant of the people as the chairman. This is just a different division of labor in the revolution... Our work is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause." Comrades, how well Chairman Liu's words are said! Isn't Comrade Shi Chuanxiang's deeds vividly illustrating that in our country, as long as the people need it, no matter what job it is, it is a promising job! There are many other facts that can prove this point.
    We know that Comrade Feng Fusheng used to work as a cook, and cooking was always considered a job without prospects in the past. But in our country, everything that the people need is a job with great potential. Didn't Comrade Feng Fusheng make extraordinary achievements in a place that some people thought was not worthy of the stage, and become a famous activist in the whole army in studying Chairman Mao's works?
    Comrade Li Suwen, deputy political instructor of the Shenyang Heping Non-Staple Food Store, was a salesperson not long ago. Salespeople were considered to be standing behind the counter, serving people, and were also considered to be jobs without prospects in the past. But, for the same reason, today, as long as it is a job that the people need, it is a promising job. Comrade Li Suwen said: "My position for serving the people is the job of a salesperson. Doing a good job as a salesperson is conducive to realizing the Party's purpose of serving the people; I can send the Party's warmth to the hearts of the masses through my hands, so that the masses will love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love the socialist system even more." We see how well she connects her ordinary work with serving the people. She did this and made outstanding achievements, and now she has become a pacesetter in studying Chairman Mao's works on the commercial front.
    We say that as a revolutionary soldier, one should have great ideals and lofty goals, but greatness comes from the ordinary. Without a large amount of daily and specific work, there would be no earth-shattering revolutionary cause. Whether being a farmer or a worker, in the local area or in the army, flying an airplane or standing guard, doing construction, etc., these are all indispensable divisions of labor in the earth-shattering revolutionary cause, and they are all the most concrete manifestations of serving the people. To achieve "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, first of all, we must love our work. Regardless of the level of position, the weight of the burden, or the quality of the conditions, as long as the Party needs it, it is a promising job, and as long as the people need it, we should be happy to do it. Lei Feng said: "The entire task of a Communist Party member is to wholeheartedly serve the people," so he loved every line of work he did, and was proficient in every line of work he did. Wherever he was placed, he would shine. According to the needs of the revolutionary cause, all revolutionaries are here today and there tomorrow, doing this work today and that work tomorrow, and there will be changes, but no matter how much it changes, as long as our heart to serve the people does not change, we can cope with all changes. Let us take a good look at what Comrade Wang Jie said: "What is ideal, revolution to the end is the ideal; what is the future, serving the people is the future; what is happiness, serving the people is happiness." We should be like him, doing everything wholeheartedly and steadfastly, being a revolutionary screw, wherever the Party screws us, we will be there, never rusting, and shining brightly.
    In short, serving the people should be "completely" and "thoroughly," which means wholeheartedly, not half-heartedly for the revolution, leaving a small half-heart for oneself, and there must not be any selfishness. Wang Jie said: "One more point of selfishness, and there will be one less point of revolutionary thought." Only by eradicating selfishness can we establish a world view of wholeheartedly for the revolution.
    When a person has not established a proletarian world view, he may proceed from the interests of the revolution in certain things, but he cannot consistently and wholeheartedly for the revolution. Therefore, Chairman Mao said: "It is not difficult for a person to do some good deeds, what is difficult is to do good deeds all his life, not to do bad deeds, and to be consistently beneficial to the broad masses." Only by establishing a revolutionary world view can we proceed from the interests of the revolution at all times, in everything, and in every place. Therefore, Chairman Mao also said: "The change of world view is a fundamental change."
    Wang Jie's learning from Zhang Side grasped a fundamental problem in his noble qualities, namely, the problem of the revolutionary world view. When we learn "Serve the People," we must also grasp this fundamental problem like Wang Jie.
    And the fundamental method of establishing a revolutionary world view is to read Chairman Mao's books and work hard on the word "use," and be able to pass the test in thought and action. Chairman Mao said: "For the theory of Marxism, we must be able to be proficient in it and apply it, and the purpose of being proficient is entirely for application"; and said: "If we only talk about connection in words, but do not implement connection in action, then talking for a hundred years will still be useless." Whether you understand it or not, look at the action. Words can move people, and actions can move people even more. Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: We must regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all our army's work. The highest instructions must be resolutely implemented. To implement Chairman Mao's instructions well, we must be like Wang Jie: "How Chairman Mao said, that's how I do it." This is the key to whether we can establish this revolutionary world view of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

    怎样做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务
    吴玉琪
    编者按　解放军某部无线电连指导员吴玉琪同志，是以毛主席著作为基本教材上政治课的优秀政治干部。为了推广吴玉琪同志的教学经验，最近空军政治部在北京召开了观摩教学会议。在观摩教学会上，吴玉琪同志给某部一个工程兵连队讲了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇文章。他讲课的特点是：带着深厚的阶级感情，观点明确，重点突出，联系实际，语言生动。这里刊载的是吴玉琪同志讲《为人民服务》的一部分。
    树立为革命而生，为革命而死的生死观
    要完全、彻底地为人民服务，就要树立为革命而生，为革命而死的生死观。
    毛主席说：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”又说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。不过，我们应当尽量地减少那些不必要的牺牲。”
    这就是毛主席对生死问题的重要论述。我们应当如何领会呢？概括起来说，应当是，活着要为人民的利益工作，死也是为人民利益而死，这就是完全地彻底地为人民服务的革命者的一生。
    具体地说，我们要从以下四点来领会。
    一、对待生死问题的态度，是分辨真革命还是假革命的重要标志。一个人是真革命，还是假革命，是全心全意为人民服务，还是假心假意为人民服务，是要经过许许多多考验的。但是当革命需要我们勇敢献身的时候，却是各种考验中间最过硬的考验。在这种考验面前，是无产阶级硬骨头，还是贪生怕死的可怜虫，没有丝毫含糊的余地。因此，只有树立起为革命而生，为革命而死的革命世界观，并随时有了为革命献身的准备，才算达到了完全、彻底为人民服务的最高境界。我们的党是革命的党，我们的军队是革命的军队，我们要革命，就不会害怕必要的牺牲。
    二、革命先烈和英雄人物是我们的榜样。
    在过去长期的革命战争年代，在今天的社会主义革命和社会主义建设年代，无数的革命先烈、英雄人物在生死问题上给我们树立了光辉的榜样。这里我想说三种情形：
    第一种人，他们在敌人的屠刀下表现了宁死不屈。
    就拿刘胡兰烈士来说吧。一九四七年一月十二日，刘胡兰在就义前用两只眼睛狠狠瞪住敌人，向阎匪军官大喝一声：“我咋个死法”！两个凶恶的敌人说：“一个样”。刘胡兰便昂首挺胸走到了铡刀跟前，英勇就义，她当时仅仅才十五岁，但却表现了一个共产党员的高贵品质，在敌人面前坚贞不屈。正象毛主席亲笔题词说的那样，她“生的伟大，死的光荣”。
    再说夏明翰烈士。他在就义前，凶手问他有什么话要说，他提笔写道：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。杀了夏明翰，还有后来人。”同志们，后来人是谁呢？后来人就是我们。那么，作为后来人我们怎么办呢？毛主席说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”大家可能知道，话剧《年青的一代》中林育生的亲生父母曾留下一张血书是这样写的：“我亲爱的孩子，刽子手已经举起了杀人的刀枪，同志们都在慷慨高歌，我们马上就要走向刑场，从此你就再也见不到你的亲生父母了。孩子，我给你写下这封信，是为了让你记住：你的父母都是工人，为了无产阶级的革命事业我们献出了自己的生命。你可以忘掉你的父亲，也可以忘掉你的母亲，可是你永远不能忘了这世界上还有阶级敌人！你要为崇高的共产主义理想而斗争！我的孩子，把红旗高高举起，永远前进，永远革命，永远忠于党，永远为人民。时间到了，牢门响了，刽子手来了，永别了，亲爱的孩子，我们去了，你可不要忘本，不要忘本哪！”同志们，作为后来人的我们，千万不能忘本哪！
    第二种人，有些革命英雄，怀着高度的阶级仇恨，为革命在战场上冲锋陷阵。董存瑞舍身炸地堡，黄继光用胸膛堵住敌人的机枪眼，杨根思拉响炸药包与敌人同归于尽，等等。这些英雄的事迹，大家是很熟悉的。当前，我们正在学习钢铁战士麦贤得的英雄事迹。大家知道，去年八月六日的海战中，麦贤得同志在头部受重伤、神智昏迷的情况下，他全不把自己的生命安危放在心上，一心想到消灭敌人，在自己的战斗岗位上，坚持到战斗胜利。这种无产阶级硬骨头的革命精神，是我们学习的好榜样。
    第三种人，当祖国人民的生命、财产遇到危险的时候，他们挺身而出，视死如归。伟大的共产主义战士王杰就是这样。去年七月十四日，他帮助人民公社训练民兵。当炸药发生意外爆炸的时候，他为了掩护在场的民兵和人民武装干部，而英勇地献出了自己的生命。大家也都知道欧阳海烈士。他是为了抢救一列乘坐五百名旅客的列车，而英勇牺牲的。他用自己的实际行动，实现了他生前的誓言：“如果需要为共产主义的理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该，也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳。”
    以上的三种情形，说明他们都是不怕死的人，最勇敢的人。一个革命者如果连死都不怕，那么世界上就没有什么使他害怕的东西了。
    但是，也有一种死是比鸿毛还轻的。毛主席说：“替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”象《红岩》中的甫志高，电影《洪湖赤卫队》中的王金标，他们为了保住自己的狗命，出卖了江姐、许云峰和韩英，成了革命的叛徒。其实这种人是没有好下场的，甫志高还不是被双枪老太婆把他枪毙了，他们的死就比鸿毛还轻，比粪还臭，遗臭万年。
    三、为革命视死如归不是偶然的。
    一个人在革命需要的时候，能勇于牺牲，并不是偶然的，不是什么一时的冲动，而是全心全意为人民服务高贵品质的最高表现，而这种高贵品质是靠平时一点一滴培养起来的。不能设想，一个活着为自己，事事怕吃亏的人，能为人民去抛头颅、洒热血。所以说，没有私心，才能最勇敢。
    英雄人物所以能做出英雄的事迹来，正是他们平时努力学习毛泽东思想，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，一点一滴地挖掉自己的私心，长年累月提高阶级觉悟的结果。为了说明这个问题，我们看一看王杰在他日记中是怎样说的。他写道：“为党的事业忠心耿耿，为革命胜利勇于牺牲。是共产党员那能不视死如归，做革命军人岂能管个人安危”。他写道：“一旦祖国需要，我坚决响应祖国的召唤，……为了受苦受难的人民就是死了我也心甘情愿，就是上刀山入火海也永不变心。”他又写道：“只要真正需要，当牺牲的时候，革命者想到的不是害怕，而是努力以此来换得更大的胜利。”我们还可以看一看王杰平时的行动，那里最困难最危险，他就挺身而出，奋勇当先。施工当中，爬高空、钻毛洞，在拱顶上打炮眼的是他，有了哑炮，争先去排除的是他，冬天架桥，第一个跳下冰水的也是他；在抗洪斗争中带头在水中探路的还是他。从王杰所说所做的可以看出，他在平时就非常注意培养和树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观了，真正做到了言行一致。他的英勇牺牲，就是他为人民利益一不怕苦、二不怕死伟大革命精神的最高表现。
    四、怎样正确理解毛主席说的“我们应当尽量地减少那些不必要的牺牲”这一句话？我想，一个革命战士，在革命利益、人民利益需要的时候，应该勇于献出自己的生命，这是没有疑问的。但是并不等于不必珍惜自己的生命。打个比方说，我们搞施工，如果有的同志为了给大家露一手，不按操作规程办事，不注意安全，出了事故，这就不对了。这是不符合革命利益的，因此也不是真正的勇敢。
    我们对生死问题要有辩证的观点。打仗的时候，我们讲究战术，是为了消灭敌人，在平时，我们锻炼身体，是为了更好地干革命工作。这和贪生怕死是根本不同的。为了说明这个问题，我想讲一讲《王若飞在狱中》这本书里的一段对话，对我们可能有启发。
    我们知道王若飞同志在狱中度过了五年零七个月，他在对敌斗争中给我们树立了光辉的榜样。有一次一个难友问他：“黄先生（化名叫黄敬斋），听说你的官司很严重，你怎么总是乐呵呵地，一点也不发愁？”王若飞同志答：“我干的事，不是发愁的事。至于能不能熬出牢门，愁有什么用！把自己愁坏了，就是出去，也成了废物，那不更坏吗？”
    当时一个上了年纪的难友又问了：“我有一件事弄不懂：你打官司时，骂国民党，骂蒋介石，天不怕、地不怕，连死也不怕，豁出一条命，真够条好汉子；可是，坐在牢里，还天天练操，那样日习夜练，又好象很爱护自己的身体，这究竟是怎么回事？”
    王若飞同志听见问得有意思，就笑了起来，他说：“这很简单：我不怕死，是因为敌人要损害我们的真理，我必须拼命保护我们的真理；我爱护身体，是因为有了健壮的身体，才能更有力地卫护我们的真理。我生为真理生，死为真理死，除了真理，没有我自己的东西。”
    那个难友又问：“如果反动派明天杀了你，你今天的爱护身体不是白搭了吗？”他又回答：“敌人就是下一刻钟杀我，我这一刻钟还要爱护身体。我活在世上，不是为敌人活着，是为我们的事业活着。不是等着被敌人杀掉，而是要杀敌人。我们和他们是死对头。我们为什么要按它的要求办事呢？”
    我们要象王若飞同志那样，活是为人民利益而活，死也是为人民利益而死。这才是生的伟大，死的光荣。
            党叫干啥就干好啥
    党叫干啥就干好啥，是全心全意为人民服务的具体表现。王杰同志说得好：要老老实实地为人民服务，当好人民的勤务员，没有别的窍门或捷径，唯一的只有听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。毛主席教导我们为人民服务要“完全”、“彻底”，这就是说，为人民服务不是有条件的，而是无条件的。要做到这一点，就要不断地和私心作斗争。大家都知道，世界上还存在着帝国主义，社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，在我们的头脑里还存在着许多非无产阶级的思想。在这种情况下，我们就要特别注意思想改造，一点一滴地挖掉私心。
    私心是什么呢？就是个人主义。它的表现是：以“我”为圆心，以个人的所谓名利、地位等为半径，划来划去跑不出个人主义的小圈子。这是资产阶级的思想，它和“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想是水火不相容的。在每一个人的头脑里，全心全意为人民服务的思想和个人主义思想的斗争，也是一场严重的阶级斗争，一场两种世界观的斗争。所以，毛主席总是教导我们：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造”。我们要按照毛主席的指示，不断地自觉地改造思想，一点一滴地挖掉自己的私心，党叫干啥就干好啥，做到“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。
    王杰同志说过：“在我们国家里不论干什么工作，只要你能全心全意为人民服务，都能干出名堂来。”确实是这样，掏粪的工人也能当全国劳动模范，也一样见到毛主席。有些同志不是听过清洁工人时传祥的报告，他不是成了全国著名的劳动模范，当了全国人民代表？记得刘主席曾经对时传祥同志说过这样一段话：“我和你老时是一样的，都是人民的勤务员，你当清洁工人是人民的勤务员，我当主席也是人民的勤务员，这只是革命分工的不同。……我们的工作都是革命事业中不可缺少的一部分”。同志们，刘主席的话说得多好啊！时传祥同志的事迹不是生动地说明了在我们的国家里，只要人民需要，不论什么工作都是有前途有出息的工作么！还有许多事实可以证明这一点。
    我们知道丰福生同志过去是干炊事员工作的，而炊事员工作在过去一直被认为是没有出息的。可是在我们国家里，凡是人民需要的，就都是大有可为的工作。丰福生同志不就是在有人认为上不了台的地方，做出了不平凡的成绩，成了全国全军有名的学习毛主席著作积极分子么？
    沈阳和平副食品商店副政治指导员李素文同志，不久前是营业员。营业员在过去是被认为站柜台的、侍候人的，也是被认为没有出息的。但是，同样的道理，在今天只要是人民需要的工作就都是有出息的。李素文同志说：“我为人民服务的岗位，就是营业员工作。我把营业员工作做好了，就有利于实现党的为人民服务的目的；能够通过我的手把党的温暖送到群众的心上，使群众更加热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义制度。”我们看她把自己平凡的工作和为人民服务联系得多么好。她这样做了，就做出了出色的成绩，现在成了商业战线上的学习毛主席著作的标兵。
    我们说，做为一个革命战士，应当具有伟大的理想和远大的奋斗目标，但伟大出于平凡，没有大量的、日常的、具体的工作，就没有任何轰轰烈烈的革命事业。当农民还是当工人，在地方还是在部队，开飞机还是站岗放哨、搞施工等等，这都是轰轰烈烈革命事业中的不可缺少的分工，都是为人民服务的最具体的表现。要做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，首先就要热爱自己的工作，不管职位高低，担子轻重，条件好坏，只要党需要，就是有前途的工作，只要人民需要，就应该愉快地去做。雷锋说：“共产党员的全部任务就是全心全意为人民服务”，所以，他干一行爱一行，干一行专一行，放到那里那里亮。根据革命事业的需要，一切革命者今天在这里，明天在那里，今天干这工作，明天干那工作，是会有变化的，但是不管它千变万变，只要我们为人民服务的心不变，就能应付万变。让我们好好体会王杰同志说的话吧：“什么是理想，革命到底就是理想；什么是前途，为人民服务就是前途；什么是幸福，为人民服务就是幸福。”我们应当象他那样，干什么工作，都一心一意，踏踏实实，做一个革命的螺丝钉，党把我们拧在那里，就在那里，永不生锈，闪闪发光。
    总之，为人民服务要“完全”、“彻底”，就是要全心全意，不能大半个心为革命，留着小半个心为自己，不能有一点私心。王杰说：“多一分私心，就少一分革命的思想。”只有根除私心，才能树立起一心为革命的世界观。
    一个人在没有树立起无产阶级世界观的时候，也可能在某些事情上从革命利益出发，但他不可能一贯地一心一意为革命。所以，毛主席说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众”。只有树立起革命世界观，才能时时、事事、处处从革命的利益出发。因此，毛主席又说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。
    王杰学张思德，是抓住了他的高贵品质中的一个根本问题，即革命世界观问题。我们学《为人民服务》，也要象王杰那样，抓住这个根本问题。
    而树立革命世界观的根本方法，就是读毛主席的书，在“用”字上狠下功夫，能在思想上行动上过得硬。毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用”；又说：“如果只是口头上讲联系，行动上又不实行联系，那末，讲一百年也还是无益的。”懂不懂，看行动，语言能感动人，行动更能感动人。林彪副主席指出：要把毛主席的书当成我们全军各项工作的最高指示。最高指示就必须坚决执行。要执行好毛主席的指示，我们就要象王杰那样：“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”。这就是我们能否树立起“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务这个革命世界观的关键。
