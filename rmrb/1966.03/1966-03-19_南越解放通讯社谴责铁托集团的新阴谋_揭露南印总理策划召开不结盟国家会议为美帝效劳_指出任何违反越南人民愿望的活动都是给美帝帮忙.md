    New China News Agency, Hanoi, March 18th. The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency published a commentary on the 17th, condemning the Yugoslav Tito group for attempting to once again use the name of the non-aligned countries to serve the US imperialist policy of aggression against Vietnam.

    The Liberation News Agency issued this commentary regarding a Reuters news report from March 10th. The report stated that Yugoslav Prime Minister Stambolic had discussed with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi the possibility of convening a summit of non-aligned nations to discuss the Vietnam issue and other international problems.

    The commentary said: "Since the beginning of this year, the Johnson government has been continuously sending more and more US troops and puppet troops to South Vietnam, carrying out brutal 'sweeps,' massacring the people of South Vietnam, using chemical agents and poisonous gas on a large scale to kill the people of South Vietnam and destroy crops. The Johnson clique has also stepped up its bombing of North Vietnam, plotting to expand the war to the entire Indochina peninsula. On the other hand, in order to deceive world opinion, they have constantly clamored for the 'peace talks' farce."

    The commentary pointed out: "Under these circumstances, Yugoslavia's plan to convene a conference of non-aligned nations to discuss the Vietnam issue is clearly linked to the dirty schemes of US imperialism." The commentary said that last year, the President of Yugoslavia and the Prime Minister of India proposed convening a conference of non-aligned countries to peddle Johnson's so-called peace talks. Many countries opposed Yugoslavia's speculative behavior or refused to sign the conference's statement. Some other countries, although they signed, changed their attitude when they saw the conspiracy more clearly. The President of Yugoslavia's attempt was to use the conference to act as a salesman for US imperialism, thereby undermining the credibility of the non-aligned countries.

    The commentary said that Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk correctly and justly stated in his reply to the Yugoslav President on September 3, 1965: "If the non-aligned countries do not consider the legitimate demands of the Vietnamese people, they will consciously or unconsciously show themselves to be tools of the US imperialists' conspiracy."

    The commentary said: "In order to liberate and reunify their homeland, the people of South Vietnam are determined to make sacrifices in the struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys. They will not shrink in the face of the US imperialist scheme to expand the war or weaken their will in the face of Johnson's naked 'peace offensive.'" The commentary said, "The people of South Vietnam, who have experienced twenty years of war, cherish peace very much. But peace is inseparable from national independence, and any plan to solve the Vietnam problem, if it does not proceed from the sacred aspirations of the Vietnamese people, will not help the just cause of the Vietnamese people; on the contrary, it will only help the American imperialist aggressors."

    南越解放通讯社谴责铁托集团的新阴谋
    揭露南印总理策划召开不结盟国家会议为美帝效劳
    指出任何违反越南人民愿望的活动都是给美帝帮忙
    新华社河内十八日电　越南南方解放通讯社十七日发表评论，谴责南斯拉夫铁托集团企图再次利用不结盟国家的名义为美帝国主义侵略越南的政策效劳。
    解放通讯社是就路透社三月十日的一则消息发表这个评论的。这则消息说，南斯拉夫总理斯坦鲍利奇曾同印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人谈过召开不结盟国家首脑会议来讨论越南问题等国际问题。
    评论说：“今年年初以来，约翰逊政府不断把愈来愈多的美军和仆从军派往越南南方，进行残暴的‘扫荡’，屠杀越南南方人民，大规模使用化学毒剂和毒气，杀害越南南方人民，毁坏庄稼。约翰逊集团还加紧空袭越南北方，阴谋把战争扩大到整个印度支那，另一方面，为了欺骗世界舆论，他们不断就‘和平谈判’丑剧发出叫嚣。”
    评论指出：“在这种情况下，南斯拉夫计划召开不结盟国家会议来讨论越南问题，显然是同美帝国主义的肮脏阴谋连结在一起的。”评论说，去年，南斯拉夫总统和印度总理倡议召开不结盟国家会议来兜售约翰逊的所谓和谈。许多国家反对南斯拉夫的投机行为或者拒绝在会议的声明上签字。其他一些国家虽然签了字，但当它们对这一阴谋看得清楚一些的时候就改变了态度。南斯拉夫总统的企图是利用会议来充当美帝国主义的推销员，从而破坏不结盟国家的威信。
    评论说，柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王在一九六五年九月三日给南斯拉夫总统的复信中正确而公正地说过：“如果不结盟国家不考虑越南人民的正当要求，它们就会有意无意地显示出自己是美帝国主义者的阴谋的工具。”
    评论说：“为了解放和重新统一祖国，越南南方人民决心在反对美国侵略者及其走狗的斗争中作出牺牲，他们不会在美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋面前畏缩或者在约翰逊的赤裸裸的‘和平攻势’面前减弱他们的意志。”评论说，“已经经历了二十年战争的越南南方人民十分珍视和平。但是和平是同民族独立分不开的，任何谋求解决越南问题的方案，如果不从越南人民的神圣愿望出发，都将无助于越南人民的正义事业，相反，只会给美帝国主义侵略者帮忙。”
