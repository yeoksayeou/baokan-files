    The communique also stated that on February 9, a commando unit of the patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea, in coordination with guerrillas, launched an attack on the Portuguese colonial military positions in Olossato, the old administrative and commercial center in northern Portuguese Guinea.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dakar, 7th—The African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde announced today in a communique that the party's patriotic armed forces thwarted the Portuguese colonial army's conspiracy to occupy the southern liberated areas earlier this year and achieved many new victories in the struggle against "mopping-up" operations.
    The communique, issued by the party's Secretary-General Cabral, stated that in January and February of this year, the Portuguese colonial authorities dispatched approximately three thousand colonial soldiers to launch a large-scale "mopping-up" operation against the southern liberated areas, attempting to change their increasingly miserable situation. However, the colonialists miscalculated once again, and their conspiracy was defeated under the resolute blows of the patriotic armed forces.
    The communique said: The guerrillas and regular troops of the African Independence Party of Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde launched fierce attacks on enemy strongholds on many occasions, destroying a large number of Portuguese military facilities in Jabada, Foraconda, Ampada, and other places in the south, and inflicting heavy losses on the Portuguese colonial army. On February 7 and 11, the Portuguese colonial army was ambushed by the patriotic armed forces, with eleven killed and several wounded.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam—The headquarters of the Mozambique Liberation Front issued a communique in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, on February 22, stating that from January 14 to February 7, Mozambican freedom fighters killed at least eighty Portuguese colonial soldiers in Cabo Delgado Province.
    The communique stated that on January 31, freedom fighters ambushed a Portuguese military convoy in Nwembe. They destroyed the last truck in the convoy with grenades. All fifteen Portuguese soldiers on board were killed.
    On the night of January 27, freedom fighters launched a surprise attack on Portuguese soldiers stationed near the Namioca post. Under the cover of darkness, the freedom fighters advanced to within ten meters of the enemy post before suddenly opening fire, annihilating thirty panicked colonial soldiers. (Attached picture)

    殖民主义者是不打不倒的
    葡属几内亚爱国武装连续发动进攻歼灭敌军数十名
    莫三鼻给自由战士不断出击打死葡殖民军八十人
    新华社达喀尔电  葡属几内亚和佛得角非洲独立党总书记阿米卡尔·卡布拉尔四日在这里发表公报说，葡属几内亚爱国武装二月十一日在距芒佐厄市五公里的地方袭击了一支由装甲车掩护的葡萄牙殖民军分遣部队，打死敌军士兵二十名，打伤十二名。
    爱国武装还击毁了敌军装甲车两辆。
    公报还说，二月九日，葡属几内亚爱国武装的一支突击队在游击队的配合下，向葡属几内亚北部的旧行政和商业中心奥洛萨托的葡萄牙殖民军阵地发动进攻。爱国战士们在用火箭炮摧毁了敌人的若干军事设施后，还向葡萄牙士兵散发了传单，号召他们脱离殖民军。
    新华社达喀尔七日电  葡属几内亚和佛得角非洲独立党今天在一项公报中宣布，这个党的爱国武装力量今年初挫败了葡萄牙殖民军企图占领南部解放区的阴谋，并在反“扫荡”的斗争中取得了许多新的胜利。
    这项由党的总书记卡布拉尔发表的公报说，今年一、二月间，葡萄牙殖民当局出动约三千名殖民军，向南部解放区发动大规模的“扫荡”，企图改变它日益悲惨的处境。但是，殖民主义者这次又打错了算盘，在爱国武装的坚决打击下，他们的阴谋又遭到了失败。
    公报说：葡属几内亚和佛得角非洲独立党的游击队和正规军向敌人的据点多次发动了猛烈的进攻，摧毁了南部雅巴达、福拉孔达、安帕达等地葡萄牙军的大量军事设施，并使葡萄牙殖民军遭受重大损失。二月七日和十一日，葡萄牙殖民军遭到爱国武装的伏击，十一人被打死，若干人受伤。
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电  莫三鼻给解放阵线总部二月二十二日在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆发表一项公报说，从一月十四日到二月七日，莫三鼻给自由战士在德尔加多角省至少打死了八十名葡萄牙殖民军。
    公报说，自由战士一月三十一日在纳韦姆贝伏击葡萄牙的一个军用卡车队。他们用手榴弹把这个车队最后一辆卡车炸毁了。车上的葡萄牙士兵十五人全部被炸死。
    一月二十七日夜间，自由战士对驻在纳米奥卡哨所附近的葡萄牙士兵发动奇袭。自由战士在黑夜的掩盖下前进到离敌军哨所十米以内的地方才突然开火，歼灭了三十名惊慌失措的殖民军。（附图片）
