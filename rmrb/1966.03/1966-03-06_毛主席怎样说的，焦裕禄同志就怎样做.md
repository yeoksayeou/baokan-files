Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: Our agency has recently received many letters from readers requesting information on how Comrade Jiao Yulu, in his practical work, followed Mao Zedong Thought to guide his work. To meet the readers' needs, we have extracted some materials from Comrade Jiao Yulu's speech drafts, drafted documents, annotations, and the documents he presided over the drafting of and published them. Although these materials are only a portion of Comrade Jiao Yulu's working records currently available, they are an important testimony to how Comrade Jiao Yulu creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought to guide his work.
To facilitate readers, we have divided these materials into several issues and quoted relevant quotations from Chairman Mao before each issue, so that everyone can better understand how Comrade Jiao Yulu worked according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Taking Class Struggle as the Key Link to Launch the Production Revolution

Chairman Mao's Quotations

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." "If our revolution is not to stray from the correct path and is to achieve certain success, we must take care to unite with our real friends in order to attack our real enemies."

"In our country, although socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed, the large-scale, rapid and fierce mass class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, but the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie is just being transformed. Class struggle is not over. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere will still be protracted, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce."

On the issue of grasping class struggle, Comrade Jiao Yulu acted precisely according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

On August 12, 1963, the Lankao County Party Committee held an emergency meeting of commune party committee secretaries. In his summary report, Comrade Jiao Yulu talked about leadership issues, saying:

"The guiding ideology must be clear, and production struggles should be carried out on the basis of class struggle."

"Further clarify the guiding ideology and working methods: (1) Grasp politics, grasp policies, and grasp lively ideological education. Lively ideological education mainly focuses on the good and bad ends, with the focus on the good, and appropriately grasping the bad for comparison. The county party committee and commune party committees should produce some materials to spread advanced experiences and typical deeds. (2) Grasp class education, class struggle, and class line. This is the foundation of all work. In order to educate cadres and raise class consciousness, the county party committee is preparing to summarize and issue some typical materials in this regard. (3) Commune secretaries should take the lead in going to key areas, squatting down to summarize experience, especially materials on implementing the class line, and use local materials from their own communes and teams to educate and improve the class consciousness of party members and cadres. Educate party members and cadres to recognize that, at any time and under any circumstances, they must not forget class and class struggle, and they must implement the class line in everything and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. (4) To implement the class line, we must strengthen the control of enemies. ......"

"All rural cadres must implement the class line, make intimate friends with the poor and lower-middle peasants, care for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. When going to the countryside, first visit the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to ask questions and understand the difficulties and opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants in production and life. Every meeting should talk about five things: ① Talk about class, class contradictions, and class struggle, ② Implement the class line and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants..."

On November 7, 1963, the county party committee held a four-level cadre meeting to arrange winter and spring production and disaster relief work, and to organize the masses to continue to advance towards the three scourges. Comrade Jiao Yulu advocated taking class struggle as the key link, mobilizing the comrades attending the meeting to expose the lid of class struggle in production and disaster relief, studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, and conducting a large-scale debate to further clarify the direction and road. Comrade Jiao Yulu said at the meeting:

"We cannot rust in politics, we cannot only grasp production and disaster relief without grasping class struggle, we cannot only grasp grain, cotton, and oil without grasping the enemy, ourselves, and our friends."

×　　×　　×

On January 7, 1964, he wrote in "Introducing a Production Brigade That Overturned and Developed Comprehensively in One Season":

"Why has this brigade (referring to the Lao Hanling Brigade) undergone such a great change? The main reason is that in the past year, under the leadership of the higher party committee, it has conscientiously carried out socialist education, implemented the class line, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthened party leadership, and adhered to putting politics in command... From this we draw a conclusion that production is revolution, and to revolutionize production, we must first revolutionize our thinking. With a certain material foundation, ideology can change everything. What kind of thinking, what kind of results. One kind of thinking is: under certain material conditions, adhering to the class line, fully mobilizing the masses, daring to think and act, and combining with scientific experiments, can exert great power and quickly change the backward situation; another kind of thinking is: not conscientiously studying and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, thinking lags behind the situation, work lags behind reality, unable to see the favorable situation, unable to see the potential for restoring and developing production, unable to see the enthusiasm of the masses to change the situation, and full of concerns and small steps in the work. Failing to grasp the key link of class struggle and failing to implement the class line and fully mobilize the masses, even with a certain material foundation, or even if the original foundation was better, will lead to a decline in production, a reduction in the lives of commune members, and an increase in the difficulties of the country. This is a comparison of two kinds of thinking and two kinds of results, which is worthy of deep consideration by all leading cadres."

Displaying Heroism in the Face of Difficulties, Fighting Against Difficulties

Chairman Mao's Quotations

"When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and enhance our courage."

"Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

"What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. That is a good comrade."

Comrade Jiao Yulu treated difficulties precisely according to Chairman Mao's teachings. He not only practiced it himself, but also guided, educated cadres, and encouraged and organized the broad masses to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

On June 10, 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu spoke at the three-level cadre meeting held by the county party committee:

"Through socialist education and the flood prevention and drainage struggle, under the leadership of the Party, many heroes have emerged in the old disaster areas who can withstand difficulties, overcome difficulties, and develop production. ... From the above examples, it can be seen that things are done by people, roads are always walked out by people, and difficulties are always overcome by people. Difficulties can be used as motivation, and difficulties can prompt people to revolutionize against nature. Production teams with the same conditions, or production teams with worse conditions, why are some able to do well? The key issue is that under the leadership of the Party, they can hold high the three red banners, conscientiously implement the class line and the mass line, have the perseverance to overcome difficulties, and have the heroic spirit to change the backward situation."

On September 26, 1963, Jiao Yulu wrote in "Long Live the Spirit of Poor Bastards":

"Our county has suffered continuous disasters, and many production teams have great difficulties in production and life; the difficulties are mainly manifested in poverty. Chairman Mao said: Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution. As long as we struggle and overcome difficulties, difficulties will only decrease and not increase. Overcoming one point of difficulty is one point of victory. To overcome difficulties, we must not be afraid of difficulties, we must muster our energy, and use the revolutionary spirit, like the spirit of production teams like Shizhai. There are such teams everywhere. We must seize typical examples, summarize a group of advanced teams that overcome difficulties, establish banners, and encourage confidence in victory."

On November 7, 1963, the Lankao County Party Committee, in order to arrange winter and spring production and disaster relief work, organized the masses to continue to advance towards the "three scourges," and held a four-level cadre conference. Comrade Jiao Yulu said at the conference, "This conference must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, invigorate the revolutionary spirit of party members and cadres, dare to face difficulties and fight in the past, then our winter and spring production and disaster relief and the fight against the 'three scourges' will be easier to handle."

He went on to say:

"Although our county suffered a serious flood this autumn, which has added great difficulties to our work, we must see the light in times of difficulty. We have many favorable conditions. We have the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, 360,000 diligent and brave people, a more consolidated collective economy, and a group of good examples of fighting against disasters. Also, we are an old disaster area, and cadres and the masses have experience in fighting disasters and providing relief... As long as we give full play to the positive factors of people, no matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them."

At the meeting, he severely criticized the sentiments of some comrades who feared difficulties. He said:

"There are two attitudes towards difficulties. One is to stand up and fight through. The more difficult it is, the more we should move forward, treating difficulties as a driving force for progress, and overcoming a difficulty is a victory. Such comrades are good comrades. The other is to be overwhelmed by difficulties, to be pessimistic and disappointed, to see only the difficult side and not the favorable side. They do not believe in the Party, do not believe in the masses, and do not believe in the collective economy. They do not have the energy to work." "Fearing difficulties, fearing revolution, not daring to struggle, not daring to win, not fighting through, but just muddling along, this is a manifestation of a lack of proletarian firmness. It is shameful for a Communist Party member to have this kind of thinking."

He also criticized some people's middle-of-the-road thinking. He said:

"Some people say that 'the upstream is too hard, the downstream gets a beating, and the middle stream is the happiest.' They say that 'it doesn't matter whether you are praised or not, as long as you are not criticized, it is a blessing.' There are many fears in their minds, fearing hardship, fearing overtime, fearing tension, fearing movements, fearing making mistakes. They do their work quietly, unwilling to use their brains, unwilling to work with their hands, unwilling to study, and they don't even take notes at important meetings. They only have a half-understanding of the situation below, or they only know without understanding, or they don't know without understanding. They repeat what others say, believing falsehoods as truth, and there are no definite conclusions. Their answers to questions are always estimated, approximate, almost, and without certainty. Is this doing revolution? No, this is not doing revolution, this is muddling through the revolution."

Adhering to the Collective Road, Self-Reliance

Chairman Mao's Quotations

"On what base point should we place our policy? On the base point of our own strength, which is called self-reliance." "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creativity of all the soldiers and civilians."

"All working peasants, no matter what class they belong to, cannot resist natural disasters except by organizing themselves for collective production."

Comrade Jiao Yulu resolutely acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's thinking, leading the people of Lankao, relying on collective strength, and relying on their own efforts to fight against the "three scourges" and rapidly change the face of Lankao.

On October 1, 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu wrote on a report on a good example of vigorously developing draft animal fodder:

"At present, there is also a struggle between two kinds of thinking and two roads in vigorously developing fodder: one is like the Dong and Xi Maogu villages of the Maogu Brigade, where thinking is clear, the road is correct, self-reliance is adhered to, putting politics in command is adhered to, labor is rationally organized, remuneration is rationally resolved, the class line is adhered to, mass movements are vigorously launched, and layers have special personnel to grasp, grasp tightly, continuously grasp, and grasp to the end. As a result, the shortage of grass has been turned into a surplus of grass. This not only solves the fodder problem, but also, through large-scale storage of fodder, conducts an education on striving for strength, self-reliance, loving the collective, relying on the collective, and production for self-rescue for the commune members, further improving the consciousness of the masses, further consolidating the collective economy, and laying an ideological foundation for future work. This is a socialist road of production and disaster relief. However, judging from the current situation, not all cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams have clarified this road. As far as we know, a small number of cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams have not seriously summarized the lessons learned from the serious difficulties caused to agricultural production by the shortage of grass and the resulting deaths of draft animals in the past few years. They are not clear about the principles and roads for solving the problem of draft animal fodder, lack the spirit of self-reliance and striving for strength, have not seriously implemented the class line and vigorously launched mass movements, and therefore lack confidence, determination, and speed of action. Some even have no idea about the shortage of grass, and simply rely on state relief and foreign aid. This is a wrong road."

On October 3, 1963, a comrade from the County Party Committee Office wrote a typical investigation of self-reliance, looking downwards, and relying on the masses to grow wheat well. He wrote on this investigation material:

"Our county's some production brigades and production teams have suffered disasters for years and have relatively large difficulties. This year, they have suffered even greater floods than in the previous two years. What kind of thinking? What kind of road? To overcome difficulties and conquer natural disasters is a matter of principle and road that is placed before us. There are only two roads: one is to rely on the collective economy, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, strive for strength under the leadership of the Party, self-reliance, carry forward revolutionary heroism, carry forward the 'poor bastard' spirit, find out the causes of the disaster, formulate specific measures to overcome difficulties in a realistic way, and lead the masses to muster their energy and make unyielding struggles against difficulties, and there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The other is to lack confidence in the face of difficulties, lack the 'poor bastard' spirit and revolutionary drive, and simply rely on state relief and foreign aid... As a result, not only will difficulties not be overcome, but more importantly, people's thinking will be ruined. Difficulties will become increasingly insurmountable. The Shuang Yangshu Village of Hongmiao Commune also had a sharp struggle between two kinds of thinking and two roads at the beginning of how to grow wheat well this year, but because they adhered to implementing the class line, relied on the collective strength of the People's Commune, put the difficulties and the roads to solve the difficulties out for the masses to choose. After repeated discussions by the masses, the second road is impassable, and only the first road is the fundamental solution... Our masses have a high level of consciousness after long-term education by the Party, and they also have rich experience in how to overcome natural disasters. As long as we resolutely rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, there will be endless methods, and any difficulties can be overcome."

×　　×　　×

On September 26, 1963, he wrote in "Long Live the Spirit of Poor Bastards": "The Shizhai Production Team of the Dawangzhuang Brigade of the Zhangjunmu Commune is a particularly disaster-stricken team that has suffered disasters for three seasons. This year, it plans to plant 200 mu of wheat, with a total of two draft animals, and one of them cannot be used due to injury. Only one can be used. It is indeed very difficult to plant wheat on time. What to do? There are two roads. One is to use manpower to pull plows and plow the land to replace animal power, strive for strength, do it yourself, and grow wheat well; the other is to rely on tractors, rely on government loans to buy livestock, and rely on foreign teams to provide support. After checking and comparing, they chose the former—taking the road of self-reliance and giving up the latter—the road of relying on waiting. As a result, after ten days of hard work, the team's 200 mu of autumn land has been basically plowed and harrowed, and it is no longer a problem to plant wheat on time. The cadres and commune members of the Shizhai Production Team are commendable, should be praised, and are worthy of learning for their spirit of striving for strength, not fearing difficulties, hard work, self-reliance, and overcoming difficulties."

×　　×　　×

On September 28, 1963, Lu Dongde, a Communist Party member of the Baizi Production Team of the Putaoyuan Brigade of the Hongmiao Commune, wrote a letter to the County Party Committee, telling about how the commune members, after recalling and comparing the new and old societies, demanded self-reliance, more grain production, support for national construction, support for cities, and support for disaster areas. After receiving the letter, Comrade Jiao Yulu drafted a notice on behalf of the County Party Committee on discussing Comrade Lu Dongde's letter to the County Party Committee throughout the county. He wrote in the notice:

"This brigade is a seriously disaster-stricken brigade in Hongmiao Commune that has suffered disasters for several consecutive years. The Baizi Production Team has also relied on state relief for years. This village has been ravaged by floods for years due to its low-lying terrain. The entire village has been destroyed, and all commune members have moved to live on the embankment. It can be seen that their difficulties are great. Although they have suffered even more severe natural disasters this year than in the previous two years, under the leadership of the Party and the support of the state, they have striven for strength, relied on their own efforts, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, relied on the collective economy, and carried forward the 'poor bastard' spirit, with tenacious revolutionary will, overcame the shortage of grass for livestock, the difficulty of catching seedlings in saline-alkali land, and the serious waterlogging disasters in both the wheat and autumn seasons, and won a relatively good harvest. The County Party Committee requires all disaster teams to learn from the Baizi Production Team's spirit of striving for strength and self-reliance, muster their energy, harvest the autumn crops well, plant wheat well, and be determined to remove the label of disaster team as soon as possible."

Investigation and Research, From the Masses, To the Masses

Chairman Mao's Quotations

"No investigation, no right to speak."

"Can't you solve that problem? Then investigate its present condition and its history! When you have made a thorough investigation, you will know how to solve it."

"In whatever work we Communists do, there are two methods that must be adopted: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of the leadership and the masses."

"Concentrate ideas from the masses and then persevere in them so that the ideas go back to the masses, so as to form correct leadership opinions. This is the basic method of leadership."

Chairman Mao's instructions on investigation and research, seeking truth from facts, from the masses, and to the masses, were implemented in Comrade Jiao Yulu's work.

Comrade Jiao Yulu went to Lankao in the winter of 1962 and soon went to Hanling Commune to conduct investigation and research. Based on what he saw in the investigation, he wrote a survey report to the County Party Committee on December 17 on consolidating the collective economy and developing agricultural production. In the report, he analyzed the current situation, the collective economic situation, and the ideological trends of various classes. At the same time, he put forward the following suggestions for the next step of work:

"The main danger in the current movement is ideological impatience and the attitude of making a big fanfare in work style. This is mainly manifested in the fact that some comrades in the movement do not proceed from the level of mass consciousness, do not start from the needs of the masses, and do not carry out work according to the different situations of each production team, but mechanically copy the plan, mechanically copy the steps, and mechanically hold on to the time; in educating the masses, they are not good at gentle rain and drizzle, but like pouring rain, explaining all kinds of documents at once, so that the masses accept them in a 'cramming' manner; in terms of methods, they only like to hold large meetings, do not like small discussion meetings, only used to teachers speaking first, and not used to raising the questions for common discussion and guiding the masses to check, calculate, compare, and educate themselves, and raise the level of the masses to the level of the Party's policies, according to the purpose and requirements of consolidating the collective... If this approach is not corrected immediately, it will inevitably turn the movement into formalism, a formality, and take a detour. Cadres should be educated to carry forward the fine work style of hardship and deep-goingness during the land reform, and truly go deep, deep into the cattle shed, the dining hall, and deep into every household, to understand the situation, listen to reflections, publicize policies, and conduct ideological mobilization for each household and each person, and conduct socialist education." The County Party Committee believed that Comrade Jiao Yulu's opinions were correct and promptly forwarded the report.

×　　×　　×

In June 1963, the Nanzhang Commune Party Committee discovered that the seeds had not been properly stored and wrote a self-criticism report to the County Party Committee. Comrade Jiao Yulu drafted a notice to illustrate the importance of investigation and research through this incident. He wrote:

"It can be seen from this report that any work that does not do in-depth investigation and research, and that routinely reports and mechanically copies the figures reported by the lower levels, will seriously harm people. Please read the Nanzhang report to the Party Committee of each commune and the Party Branch of the Brigade, and draw useful lessons from it."

×　　×　　×

On March 12, 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu put forward a written opinion on the issue of formulating a production plan at an enlarged meeting of the County Party Committee. He wrote:

"I believe that the formulation of a production plan is a mass movement, and it must publicize policies, mobilize the masses, make samples, promote all-round development, organize inspections, seize models, hold on-site meetings, and disseminate experience in a timely manner to do well... This work is a very complex and very meticulous mass movement. It is formalism to simply have the team committee put forward opinions, formally hold a meeting of commune members to pass them, or have a few cadres think about it and submit it to the higher levels. It must be corrected."

×　　×　　×

In order to change the face of Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu led a survey team composed of more than 100 cadres, old farmers, and technicians in the spring of 1963 to conduct surveys and research throughout the county to chase floods, investigate wind gaps, and explore quicksand. After the investigation, under the auspices of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the County Party Committee drafted a "preliminary draft of ideas for controlling sand, controlling alkali, and controlling water in three to five years." When writing this document, Comrade Jiao Yulu particularly emphasized that in the fight against the "three scourges," we must adhere to the working method of the mass line. According to Comrade Jiao Yulu's opinion, the County Party Committee wrote in this document:

"A comprehensive on-the-spot survey must be conducted on the area of all sand, alkali, and waterlogging in the county, their distribution, and the degree of harm to crops... Draw out the diagrams for graded and phased governance. What changes will we have if we realize the one-year plan, what changes will we have if we realize the two-year plan, and what changes will we have if we realize the three-to-five-year plan. Year by year, piece by piece, let the masses discuss, concentrate the masses' scattered and unsystematic opinions, sort them out, persist in them, then concentrate them again, and persist in them, endlessly circulating among the masses, truly achieving that policies come from the masses and theory comes from practice, so that our plans can become the actions of the masses and have the possibility of realization. Therefore, the production team's plan must be discussed and approved by the commune members' congress, the brigade's plan must be discussed and approved by the brigade's commune members' representative congress, and the commune's plan must be discussed and approved by the commune's commune members' representative congress and reported to the county for approval. This may seem like a formality, but it is actually mobilization. It seems slow, but it is actually very fast. It is also our serious and responsible attitude towards work, the working method of the mass line, the process of mobilizing the masses, and the process of education..."

"The work of controlling sand, controlling alkali, and controlling water is both professional work, technical work, and economic work, and it is also mass work and political work. We must have the participation of the broad masses. It is impossible to do it well without the participation of the masses. We must combine the leadership of the Party with the mass line, combine putting politics in command with economic measures, combine the current interests of the masses with the long-term interests, and educate the masses not to damage long-term interests because of greed for immediate interests, so that it can be done well..."

After this draft was drafted, Comrade Jiao Yulu wrote on this document:

"I suggest that 1,000 to 1,500 copies of this document be printed in lead and distributed to cadres above the Party branch secretary, one copy per person, calling on them to study it and offer advice and suggestions for this purpose. This document should be talked about at various meetings in the future, such as party congresses, people's congresses, model worker meetings, and various cadre meetings. It is also a supplementary material for party lessons and youth league lessons."

专栏：

    毛主席怎样说的，焦裕禄同志就怎样做
    ——从焦裕禄同志起草的文件和讲话中看他是如何活学活用毛泽东思想的
    新华社编者按：本社最近接到许多读者来信，要求介绍焦裕禄同志生前在实际工作中如何按照毛泽东思想，指导工作的情况。为了满足读者的要求，我们从焦裕禄同志的讲话稿和起草的文件、批语以及他主持起草的文件中，摘录了一些材料，发表出来。这些材料，虽然只是目前能够找到的焦裕禄同志工作记录的一部分，但它是焦裕禄同志活学活用毛泽东思想，指导工作的一个重要见证。
    为了便于读者阅读，我们把这些材料分成几个问题，并在每个问题的前面，摘引毛主席有关语录，使大家可以更好的了解焦裕禄同志是如何按照毛主席的指示来做工作的。以阶级斗争为纲开展生产革命
    毛主席语录
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”“我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”
    “在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    在抓阶级斗争这个问题上，焦裕禄同志正是按照毛主席的指示办事的。
    一九六三年八月十二日，兰考县委召开一次公社党委书记紧急会议，焦裕禄同志在总结报告中谈到领导问题时说：
    “指导思想必须明确，在阶级斗争的基础上，搞生产斗争。”
    “进一步明确指导思想和工作方法：（一）抓政治、抓政策、抓活的思想教育。活的思想教育主要抓好坏两头，以抓好的为主，适当抓坏的进行对比，对于先进经验和典型事迹，县委和公社党委要拿出些材料进行传播。（二）抓阶级教育、阶级斗争和抓阶级路线，这是各项工作的根本所在。为了教育干部，提高阶级觉悟，县委准备总结印发一些这方面的典型材料。（三）公社书记带头深入重点，蹲下来总结经验，特别是贯彻阶级路线的材料，用本社、本队的活材料，来教育提高党员、干部的阶级觉悟。教育党员干部认识到，不论在任何时候和任何情况下，都不能忘掉阶级和阶级斗争，时时事事都要贯彻阶级路线，都要依靠贫下中农。（四）贯彻阶级路线，必须加强对敌人的管制。……”
    “所有农村干部，必须贯彻阶级路线，和贫下中农交知心朋友，关心贫下中农，依靠贫下中农。下乡工作首先到贫下中农家里看看问问，了解贫下中农生产、生活的困难和意见。每次会议都要讲五条：①讲阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，②贯彻阶级路线，依靠贫下中农……”
                  ×　　×　　×
    一九六三年十一月七日，县委召开四级干部会，安排冬春季生产救灾工作，组织群众继续向三害进军。焦裕禄同志主张以阶级斗争为纲，发动到会同志大揭生产救灾方面的阶级斗争的盖子，带着问题学习毛主席著作，开展大辩论，进一步明确方向道路。焦裕禄同志在这个会上说：
      “我们不能在政治上生锈，不能只抓生产救灾，不抓阶级斗争，不能只抓粮、棉、油，不抓敌、我、友”。
                  ×　　×　　×
    一九六四年一月七日他在《介绍一个一季翻身全面发展的生产大队》一文中写道：
    “这个大队（按指老韩陵大队）为什么起了这么大的变化呢？主要是一年来在上级党委的领导下，认真开展了社会主义教育，贯彻了阶级路线，依靠了贫下中农，加强了党的领导，坚持了政治挂帅，……从此我们得出一条结论，生产是革命，要革生产的命，必须先革思想的命，有了一定物质基础，思想能变一切，什么样的思想，就做出什么样的结果。一种思想是：在一定的物质条件下，坚持阶级路线，充分发动群众，敢想敢干和科学实验相结合，就能发挥巨大的力量，很快改变落后面貌；另一种思想是：没有认真学习和贯彻毛主席关于阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三项伟大革命的指示，思想落后于形势，工作落后于实际，看不到有利形势，看不到恢复发展生产的潜力，看不到群众要求改变面貌的积极性，工作中顾虑重重，小手小脚。抓不住阶级斗争这条纲，不能够贯彻阶级路线，充分发动群众，虽然有了一定的物质基础，或者原来的基础就较好，也会使生产下降，社员生活降低，增加国家的困难。这就是两种思想两种结果的对比，值得所有领导干部深思熟虑。”
    在困难面前逞英雄　同困难作斗争
    毛主席语录
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    “什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”
    焦裕禄同志正是按照毛主席的教导对待困难的。他不仅自己身体力行，也引导、教育干部和鼓励、组织广大群众按照毛主席的指示去办。
    一九六三年六月十日，焦裕禄同志在县委召开的三级干部会上讲道：
    “通过社会主义教育和防汛排涝斗争，老灾区在党的领导下，出现了不少能顶住困难，战胜困难，发展生产的英雄好汉。……从以上实例可以看出，事在人为，路总是人走出来的，困难总是要人去克服的。困难能当做动力，困难能促使人向自然革命。同样条件的生产队，或者条件更差的生产队，为什么有的能搞的很好呢？关键问题是他们能在党的领导下，高举三面红旗，认真的贯彻了阶级路线，群众路线，有克服困难的毅力，有改变落后面貌的英雄气概。”
                    ×　　×　　×
    一九六三年九月二十六日，焦裕禄在《穷棒子精神万岁》一文中写道：
      “我县连续遭灾，有很多生产队在生产、生活上都存在着很大的困难；困难主要表现在穷上。毛主席说：穷则思变，要干，要革命。有了困难只要去斗争，去克服，困难只会减少不会增加。克服一分困难，就是一分胜利。要克服困难，必须不怕困难，必须鼓足干劲，用革命的精神，象石寨这样的生产队的精神，各地都有，要抓住典型，总结一批克服困难的先进队，树立旗帜，鼓舞胜利信心。”

    一九六三年十一月七日，兰考县委为了安排冬春季的生产救灾工作，组织群众继续向“三害”进军，召开一次四级干部大会，焦裕禄同志在这次大会上说“我们这次大会，必须按照毛主席指示，把党员和干部的革命精神振作起来，敢于迎着困难，战斗着过去，那么，我们今冬明春的生产救灾和除‘三害’斗争就好办了。”
    他接着说：
    “今年秋季咱县虽遭受了严重的涝灾，给我们的工作增加了很大困难，但是，我们在困难的时候要看到光明，我们的有利条件很多，有党中央和毛主席的领导，有三十六万勤劳勇敢的人民，集体经济更加巩固，有了一批抗灾斗争的好榜样。还有，我们是老灾区，干部、群众都有抗灾救灾的经验……只要我们充分发挥人的积极因素，再大的困难也能克服。”
    会上，他严肃批评了一些同志的畏难情绪，他说：
    “对待困难有两种态度，一种是站起来，斗争过去，越是困难越往前闯，把困难当成前进的动力，克服一个困难，就是一个胜利。这样的同志才是好同志。另一种是困难压头，悲观失望，只看到困难的一面，看不到有利条件的一面，他们不相信党，不相信群众，不相信集体经济，干起工作来没有劲头。”“怕困难，怕革命，不敢斗争，不敢胜利，不是战斗着过去，而是得过且过，这是缺乏无产阶级坚定性的表现。一个共产党员有这种思想，那是可耻的”。
    他还批评了一些人的中游思想。他说：
    “有的人说什么‘上游太辛苦，下游打屁股，中游最幸福。’说什么‘表扬不表扬没关系，只要不批评就是福气。’脑中存在着很多怕字，怕艰苦，怕加班，怕紧张，怕运动，怕犯错误，做起工作来平平静静，不愿动脑筋，不愿动手，不愿学习，重要的会议也不记笔记。对下情只是一知半解，或者只知不解，或者不知不解，人云亦云，信假为真，没有肯定的结论，回答问题总是估计、大概、差不多、没有把握。这是干革命吗？不，这不是干革命，这是混革命。”
    坚持集体道路　自力更生
    毛主席语录
    “我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”
    “一切劳动农民，不论是那个阶层，除了组织起来集体生产，是无法抵抗灾荒的。”
    焦裕禄同志坚决按照毛主席的思想办事，领导兰考人民，依靠集体力量，自力更生，同“三害”作斗争，迅速改变了兰考的面貌。
    一九六三年十月一日，焦裕禄同志在关于大搞耕畜饲草的一个好典型的报告上批道：
    “目前在大搞饲草中，也存在两种思想、两条道路的斗争：一条是象毛古大队东、西毛古两村那样思想明确，道路对头，坚持自力更生，坚持政治挂帅，合理组织劳力，合理解决报酬，坚持贯彻阶级路线，大搞群众运动，层层有专人抓，抓的紧，连续抓，一抓到底，结果变缺草为余草，这样做不但解决了饲草问题，也通过大贮饲草，对社员进行了一次发奋图强，自力更生，热爱集体、依靠集体、生产自救的教育，进一步提高了群众觉悟，进一步巩固了集体经济，给今后工作打下了思想基础。这是一条社会主义的生产救灾道路。但是从当前的情况看来，并不是所有的公社、大队、生产队的干部，都明确了这条道路的。据我们所知，少数公社、大队、生产队的干部还没有认真总结几年来由于缺草，造成耕畜死亡给农业生产带来严重困难的教训。对如何解决耕畜饲草的方针，道路不明确，缺乏自力更生、发奋图强的‘穷棒子’精神，没有认真贯彻阶级路线，大搞群众运动，因而信心不高，决心不大，行动不快，有的甚至对缺草情况，心中无数，走着说着，或单纯依靠国家救济和外地支援。这是一条错误的道路。”

    一九六三年十月三日，县委办公室的同志写一个自力更生，两眼向下，依靠群众，种好小麦的典型调查，他在这个调查材料上批道：
      “我县部分生产大队和生产队，连年受灾，困难较大，今年又遭受了比前二年更大的水灾，用什么思想？走什么道路？来克服困难，战胜灾荒，是摆在我们面前的原则性的方针道路问题，这只有两条道路：一条是依靠集体经济，依靠贫下中农，在党的领导下发奋图强，自力更生，发扬革命的英雄主义，发扬‘穷棒子’精神，找出受灾的原因，实事求是的制定克服困难的具体措施，带领群众鼓足干劲，向困难做顽强不屈的斗争，就没有克服不了的困难。另一条是在困难面前缺乏信心，缺乏‘穷棒子’精神和革命的干劲，单纯依靠国家救济和外地支援，……结果不但困难不能克服，更重要的是把人的思想搞坏了。困难就越来越克服不了。红庙公社双杨树村，对于如何种好今年的小麦，开始也是存在两种思想、两条道路的尖锐斗争的，但由于他们坚持贯彻了阶级路线，依靠人民公社的集体力量，将困难和解决困难的道路摆出来叫群众选择，经过群众反复讨论，第二条道路是行不通的，只有走第一条道路才是根本办法。……我们的群众经过党的长期教育，觉悟是高的，对如何战胜灾荒也是有丰富经验的，只要坚决的依靠群众，发动群众，办法是无穷的，任何困难也是可以克服的。”
                       ×　　×　　×
    一九六三年九月二十六日，他在《穷棒子精神万岁》一文中写道：“张君墓公社大王庄大队石寨生产队，是一个三季遭灾的特重灾队，今年计划种二百亩小麦，共计二头牲口，还有一头因伤残不能用，能用的只有一头，要按时种上小麦，确实困难是很大的。怎么办？有两条道路，一条是人力拉犁、翻地，代替畜力，发奋图强，自己动手，种好小麦；另一条是依靠拖拉机，依靠政府贷款买牲口，依靠外队去支援，经过查算对比，他们选择了前者——走自力更生的道路，放弃了后者——依靠等待的道路，其结果，经过十来天的大干，全队的二百亩秋地，已经基本犁完耙好，按时种好小麦，已经不成问题了。石寨生产队的干部和社员这种发奋图强，不怕困难，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，克服困难的顽强精神，是可佳的，是应该表扬的，是值得学习的。”

    一九六三年九月二十八日，红庙公社葡萄架大队坝子生产队共产党员鲁东德将社员经过新、旧社会回忆对比，纷纷要求自力更生、多打粮食，支援国家建设，支援城市，支援灾区一事写信告诉县委，焦裕禄同志接信后，就替县委起草一份关于在全县范围内讨论鲁东德同志给县委一封来信的通知，他在通知中写道：
    “这个大队是红庙公社连续遭灾几年的重灾大队。坝子生产队也是连年依靠国家救济。这个村庄因地势洼连年遭受水灾，村庄已全部毁灭，全村社员已全部搬到大堤上居住，可见他们的困难是很大的。今年虽然遭受了比前二年更加严重的自然灾害，但他们在党的领导和国家支持下发奋图强，自力更生，依靠贫下中农，依靠集体经济，发扬了‘穷棒子’精神，以顽强的革命意志，战胜了牲口缺草，盐碱地不好捉苗，以及麦秋两季严重的水涝灾害，夺取了较好的收成。县委要求所有灾队都要学习坝子生产队发奋图强，自力更生的‘穷棒子’精神，鼓足干劲，收好小秋，种好小麦，下决心尽快摘掉灾队帽子。”
    调查研究　从群众中来　到群众中去
    毛主席语录
    “没有调查就没有发言权”。
    “你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”
      “我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”
      “从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”
    毛主席关于调查研究，实事求是，从群众中来，到群众中去的指示，贯彻在焦裕禄同志的工作中。
    焦裕禄同志是一九六二年冬到兰考不久，就去韩陵公社做调查研究，根据调查所见，十二月十七日便向县委写了一份关于巩固集体经济发展农业生产的调查报告。他在报告中，对当时形势、集体经济状况、各阶层思想动向作了分析，同时，对下一步工作提出了这样的建议：
    “目前运动中的主要危险是思想上的急躁情绪和工作作风上的大嗡大轰。这主要表现有些同志在运动中不从群众觉悟水平出发，不根据群众要求入手，不根据每个生产队的不同情况进行工作，而是死搬方案，死套步骤，死扣时间；在教育群众方面，不善于和风细雨，而喜欢倾盆大雨，将各种文件一下子讲完，使群众‘填鸭式’地接受；在方法上只喜欢开大会，不喜欢小会座谈，只习惯先生讲，不习惯根据巩固集体的目的要求，将问题提出来共同商量，引导群众查算对比，自我教育，将群众的水平提高到党的政策水平上来。……这样做法如不立即纠正，势必将运动搞成形式主义，走过场，走弯路。应该教育干部，发扬土改时艰苦深入的优良作风，真正地深入下去，深入到牛屋、饭场，深入到每家每户，了解情况，听取反映，宣传政策，逐户逐人地进行思想发动，进行社会主义教育。”县委认为焦裕禄同志的意见是正确的，及时批转了这一报告。

    一九六三年六月，南彰公社党委发现种子没有保管好，向县委写一个检查报告。焦裕禄同志便起草一个通报，通过这件事来说明调查研究的重要。他写道：
    “从此报告中可以看出任何工作不做深入的调查研究，照例要汇报，照抄下面报来的数字，是害人不轻的。请各公社党委，大队党支部读一读南彰的报告，从中吸取有益的教训。”
                       ×　　×　　×
    一九六三年三月十二日，焦裕禄同志在县委扩大会议上对制定生产规划问题提了一个书面意见，他写道：
    “我认为，制定生产规划是个群众运动，必须宣传政策、发动群众、做出样板、推动全面、组织检查、抓住典范、开现场会、及时传播经验，才能做好。……这项工作，是一个非常复杂、非常细致的群众运动，那种只队委会提出意见，形式主义地召开社员会通过，或几个干部想一下，上交了事，都是形式主义的，必须加以纠正。”
                       ×　　×　　×
    焦裕禄同志为了改变兰考面貌，于一九六三年春天便带领由一百多名干部、老农、技术员组成的调查队，在全县展开了追洪水、查风口、探流沙的调查研究工作。调查结束后，在焦裕禄同志主持下，县委拟出了“关于治沙、治碱、治水三、五年的初步设想草案”。在写这份文件的时候，焦裕禄同志特别强调，在除“三害”中一定要坚持群众路线的工作方法。根据焦裕禄同志的意见，县委的这份文件中写道：
    “对全县所有的沙、碱、内涝面积、及其分布情况，对农作物危害的程度，都要全面的进行实地勘查，……绘出分级分期治理的图样。实现了一年的计划我们有什么变化，实现了二年的计划我们有什么变化，实现了三、五年的计划我们又有什么变化。一年一年的、一件一件的让群众讨论，把群众分散的不系统的意见集中起来，加以整理坚持下去，再集中起来，并坚持下去，在群众中无限循环，真正做到政策来于群众，理论来于实践，我们的计划才能变成群众的行动，才有实现的可能。因此，生产队的计划必须经过社员大会讨论通过，大队批准；大队的计划必须经过大队社员代表大会讨论通过，公社批准；公社的计划必须通过公社社员代表大会讨论通过，报县批准。这样做看来是形式，事实是发动，看来很慢，其实很快，也是我们对工作严肃负责的态度，也是群众路线的工作方法，也是发动群众的过程，也是教育的过程……。”
    “治沙、治碱、治水工作，既是专业工作、技术工作、经济工作，又是群众工作、也是政治工作，一定要有广大群众参加，没有群众参加不可能搞好。要把党的领导和群众路线结合起来，把政治挂帅和经济措施结合起来，要把群众的当前利益和长远利益结合起来，教育群众不要因为贪图眼前利益去破坏长远利益，这样才能办的好……。”
    这个草案拟出以后，焦裕禄同志又在这个文件上批道：
    “我建议这个文件铅印一千——一千五百份，发给党的支部书记以上的干部每人一份，号召他们学习，并出谋献计，为此立功。这个文件今后要在各种会议上讲，如党代会、人代会、劳模会、各种干部会，也是党课、团课的辅助材料。”
    重视群众利益　关心群众生活
    毛主席语录
    “全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”
    “群众生产，群众利益，群众经验，群众情绪，这些都是领导干部们应时刻注意的。”
    “我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。……一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。”
    焦裕禄同志模范地执行了毛主席的指示。一心一意为人民服务，处处以人民的利益为重，念念不忘发展集体生产，时刻关心群众的利益和生活。他这样严格要求自己，也严格要求全县干部。
    一九六三年二月二十八日，焦裕禄同志在城关区委的一份报告上写道：
    “我们的共产党员、人民的干部，是为人民服务的，是人民的勤务员，应该拥护什么，反对什么？那些事应该带头？那些事不应该带头？有了错误采取什么态度是正确的？什么态度是错误的？通过这次讨论，使党员干部分清什么是共产主义思想？什么是资本主义思想、封建主义思想？进一步提高共产主义觉悟，分清香臭，树立共产主义风格，并勇于向那些违犯党的纪律、违犯政府法令、违反共产主义道德的行为作坚决的斗争。”

    一九六三年一月八日，焦裕禄同志为县委起草的“关于鼓足干劲搞好生产做好工作勤俭过春节的通知”中写道：
    “新年已过，春节将到，……在大好形势下，全县人民想过一个快乐年，这是可以理解的，但必须加强党的领导，既要使群众欢欢乐乐，心情舒畅过好春节，又要勤俭节约防止浪费。必须了解我县形势是有很大好转，但生产、生活上还有很大困难，还有灾区。我们必须贯彻中央和毛主席提出的勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的方针，不论公家和私人都不要浪费一文钱，可以不用的钱坚持不用，应花的尽量少花，可以不办的事情坚持不办，一切从生产出发，从节约出发。”

    一九六三年一月四日，焦裕禄在转发县委检查组对于三义寨公社西八生产队年终分配情况的检查报告中写道：
    “农民以种地为本，全家吃喝依靠集体劳动的收入。……如果社员对收入支出、库存不摸底，怎么不影响社员的集体生产积极性呢？”
    “……要求全党抓好分配，希望各区委、公社党委要下决心搞，检查运动时，首先检查分配搞了没有，有什么表现，有什么结果，有什么经验，再检查其他问题。因为这是……运动的落脚点。……”

    一九六三年九月十二日，焦裕禄同志在起草兰考县委关于种好小麦的紧急指示中写道：
    “今秋因灾减产，种好小麦是群众的迫切要求，是九、十月一切工作的中心，是搞好今冬明春生产救灾工作的中心环节。小麦种好了，群众就有了盼头，人心就稳定了，就给生产救灾打下了基础，就能够争取今冬明春工作的主动，就能够更好更快地实现‘除三害’规划。如果小麦种不上或种不好，就会使灾荒延续下去，困难越来越大。谁看不到这一点或者虽然看到了，抓不住，或者虽然抓了，但没有抓深，决心不大，行动不快，就会使工作被动，以致在工作上犯严重的错误。”

    一九六三年十一月，焦裕禄同志在全县四级干部大会上，特别强调了关心贫农下中农社员的生活问题。他批评了那些不依靠贫农下中农的思想行为。他说：“有些人，遇事不进行阶级分析，在工作中不依靠贫农下中农；在农村工作，不进贫农门，不听贫农话，不开贫农会，不吃贫农饭，不住贫农家，不了解贫农下中农在生产生活上有些什么困难，或者看到了无动于衷，没有阶级感情。”他问公社书记们：“有的贫农生活困难，你们发现了没有？发现以后你们是怎样想的？帮助他们解决了没有？这是个立场问题。工作上不依靠贫农下中农，生活上不关心贫农下中农，怎么能把工作做好呢！”
    重视民兵工作　狠抓三落实
    毛主席语录
    “帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”
    焦裕禄同志认真地贯彻了毛主席关于民兵工作的指示。
    一九六三年二月九日，他把县人民武装部写的一个关于加强民兵工作的文件批转给各区委。他在批语中写道：
    “民兵建设是我们党的一项经常的重要任务，是国防建设的一个重要方面。我们的国防建设的主要内容：一是正规军、二是民兵。这是国防建设的两条腿走路的方针，犹如车之两轮，鸟之两翼，缺一不可。我们的党是一贯的重视民兵建设工作的，在过去的屡次战争中，正由于我们认真的贯彻执行毛主席的军事思想，在加强正规军建设的同时，在全国各地，组织了强大的有阶级觉悟的民兵队伍，有力的配合正规军，击败了国内外一切敌人，夺取了政权，建立了中华人民共和国，保卫了社会主义建设。”
    “目前……帝国主义，反动民族主义，修正主义联合掀起一场反华大合唱，我们要提高警惕，加强民兵的建设工作，提高民兵的阶级觉悟和技术水平，充实、巩固、加强我国强大的国防力量，任何忽视民兵建设工作的领导，都会犯严重的错误。在对民兵进行军事训练的时候，特别重视民兵的阶级教育，提高阶级觉悟，这是搞好军事训练的保证，任何时候都不能忽视。”
    “在社会主义教育和各项工作中，应特别注意发挥民兵的组织作用，不能光搞一揽子会议，将民兵的单独活动去掉了。民兵干部也不能长期固定在一个点上，丢掉了整个民兵工作的领导……。”

    一九六三年×月×日焦裕禄在县人民武装部关于西张集大队党支部是如何领导民兵工作的调查报告上批道：
    “爪营公社西张集大队党支部是非常重视民兵工作的，他们不是口头的重视，而是实际的重视，真正将民兵工作当成支部的一项重要工作，列入重要的议事日程，定期加以研究，经常的加强民兵的政治思想领导和军事训练，总之，他们比较认真的执行了毛主席关于民兵工作三落实的指示，因而取得了很大的成绩，他们的经验是很好的，现批转你们参考。”
    “我们还有一部分党支部，对毛主席指示的做好民兵工作三落实的重要意义认识不够，因而对民兵工作的重要性也认识不够，抓的不紧，抓的不具体，三落实工作没认真做好。希望你们根据西张集的经验，检查一下你们的领导，还有比西张集大队党支部更好的经验，可写给县委，如还没有象西张集大队支部抓的那样紧的话，应在这次社会主义教育运动中，按照主席的指示，切实做好民兵工作三落实，使民兵在政治上、组织上、军事技术上都大大的提高一步。”
