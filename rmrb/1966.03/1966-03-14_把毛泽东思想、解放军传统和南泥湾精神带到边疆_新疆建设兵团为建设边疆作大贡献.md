    Bringing Mao Zedong Thought, the Traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and the Nanniwan Spirit to the Borderlands
    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Makes Great Contributions to Borderland Construction
    Working hard to run socialist large-scale agriculture, truly achieving comprehensive integration of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; self-reliantly running industry, finance and trade, and cultural and educational undertakings, gradually forming a prosperous situation of comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor; actively assisting people of all ethnic groups in carrying out democratic reforms and developing the collective economy, making contributions to Xinjiang's socialist construction.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 13) The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, following Chairman Mao's teachings and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of Nanniwan, have made tremendous contributions in the construction of the borderlands, setting a brilliant example for the Chinese people in self-reliantly changing the poor and blank state of affairs.
    This Production and Construction Corps, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying forward the glorious tradition of arduous struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has, over the past sixteen years, opened up wasteland, built farmland, constructed water conservancy projects, carved roads through mountains, and built factories on many uninhabited Gobi deserts in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, relying on tenacious will and diligent hands. To date, it has reclaimed and transformed over ten million mu of original desert into fertile land with crisscrossing canals and dense forest belts, built a large number of modern large-scale farms and ranches, and established a complete set of industrial enterprises. The entire corps has become a production and construction army that comprehensively develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the main focus. This contingent, with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang as close as fish and water, closely cooperates to change the face of the border areas with each passing day.
    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that entered Xinjiang in the winter of 1949. This heroic unit, which had been tested by war and had performed many meritorious services for the people, began to fight to open up wasteland, build farmland, construct water conservancy projects, and transform the Gobi desert from the time it entered Xinjiang, following Chairman Mao's teachings that the people's army is not only a fighting force, but also a working force and a production force. In 1952, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, this unit collectively transferred some of its commanders and fighters to agricultural construction units and engineering construction units. Soon, the Central Government decided to form the troops participating in production and construction into a corps, and conferred the glorious title of Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Central Government also issued a historically significant order for this purpose. From then on, all the commanders and fighters of the Production and Construction Corps, with even higher revolutionary spirit, launched a large-scale, vigorous, and solid production movement.
    The great achievements created by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in building the borderland over the past sixteen years are a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for the Nanniwan spirit.
    Sixteen years ago, when the troops entered the various reclamation areas in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, it was still a desolate Gobi desert. Drought, wind, sand, salt, and alkali were formidable enemies that the soldiers often encountered. After sixteen years of arduous struggle, the farms of the Corps have built main canals totaling more than 40,000 kilometers in length and dozens of reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than one billion cubic meters, drawing water from dozens of rivers for irrigation. In some areas lacking surface water, well irrigation has also been carried out, and well-irrigated farms have been built. The farmland of the farms has been leveled into strip fields according to the plan, which is convenient for both mechanized farming and management. Around the strip fields, the roads are straight, the canals are crisscrossed, and the forest networks are dense, and the originally dry and harsh desert climate is changing. The main operations of the farms, from plowing and sowing to harvesting and threshing, have mostly been mechanized. In recent years, the output and commercial rate of various agricultural products have been increasing, fully demonstrating the superiority of socialist large-scale agriculture.
    The farms of the Corps have also truly achieved a comprehensive combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The existing hundreds of thousands of mu of forest belts in the entire Corps not only ensure the continuous increase in agricultural production and accumulate a large amount of timber, but also create good conditions for intercropping forests and grasslands and realizing the integration of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. At present, in addition to more than 20 ranches engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, each farm in the Corps also adopts methods such as setting up pens in the fields and grazing in the forests to raise livestock, using livestock to nourish the fields, and using the fields to raise livestock, so that the number of various livestock grows rapidly. All farms near rivers, lakes, and reservoirs operate fisheries. The farms and production teams generally develop sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Due to the development of diversified operations, the annual output value of many farms and production teams outside of agriculture can account for 30 to 40 percent of the total output value, which promotes a substantial increase in agriculture, and there are profits to be turned over every year.
    Since 1950, the Production and Construction Corps has carried forward the Nanniwan spirit and, according to the needs of production and life, raised funds and built a number of small-scale industries such as agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, agricultural product processing, coal mines, power stations, and brick, tile, clothing, and food industries. Since 1958, it has also self-reliantly built large- and medium-sized industries such as iron and steel, machinery, cement, chemical, textile, sugar making, paper making, and leather making. The variety of products has expanded from dozens to thousands, and the total industrial output value has increased by more than two times compared with 1957.
    These industrial enterprises, not only are the small factories built by the soldiers themselves, making their own equipment, and relying on their own accumulation, but also many large- and medium-sized factories are also built self-reliantly by first using indigenous methods and then foreign methods, using small industries to support large industries, and adopting the method of building, producing, accumulating, and expanding simultaneously. Most of the mechanical equipment of the August 1st Sugar Factory, with an annual output of more than 20,000 tons, is provided by the Corps' own industrial enterprises. During the preparatory stage of the August 1st Wool Textile Factory, the soldiers first engaged in wool yarn production, and after accumulating funds, they built their own factory buildings and purchased their own equipment, with the actual expenditure accounting for only two-fifths of the required investment. Before some chemical plants were built, the soldiers were mobilized to collect mirabilite on the alkaliæ»©and use the accumulation from the mirabilite production as funds to expand into chemical plants.
    Due to the rapid development of industry, the pig iron, cement, various semi-mechanized farm implements and animal-powered farm implements, and some building materials needed in agriculture can now be basically self-sufficient, small steel products, fertilizers, pesticides, and spare parts for automobiles and tractors can be partially self-sufficient, and the problems of agricultural machinery repair and parts and agricultural and livestock product processing can all be solved locally. Because the variety and specifications of these products are right, the supply is timely, they meet the special needs of their own farms, and they can be supplied locally, reducing transportation costs, which not only guarantees increased agricultural production, but also greatly reduces agricultural costs. At the same time, it has also accumulated a large amount of funds for industry. From 1955 to 1964, the profits turned over by the entire Corps in industry alone, in addition to meeting the investment required for the development of industry itself, can also build more than 3 million mu of stable and high-yield farmland with water conservancy, mechanization, and landscaping.
    The Production and Construction Corps also runs finance and trade, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., self-reliantly. After more than ten years of arduous struggle, a prosperous situation of comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, has gradually formed. The places where farms are concentrated have become political, economic, and cultural centers. These centers equip the nearby farms with excellent agricultural production materials and modern science and technology, and the surrounding farms continuously supply the factories with rich raw materials.
    It is extremely convenient to implement the labor system of both industry and agriculture. During the busy farming season, a large number of workers go to the agricultural front line to participate in labor. Textile workers pick cotton in the cotton fields; sugar workers manage sugar beets in the fields; mechanical workers go deep into the fields to repair agricultural machinery.... Every worker is not only a shock worker in industrial construction, but also can skillfully engage in agricultural labor. In the slack farming season, the soldiers of the farm also go to the factory to participate in auxiliary labor. The cadres of the organs have also developed a good habit of participating in labor.
    The schools here are all run by the farms, production teams, and factories and mines themselves. The schools are located on the production base, which is conducive to the combination of teaching and productive labor. Every year, these schools create a large number of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture for the farms. The establishment of these schools provides extremely favorable conditions for implementing part-farming and part-study, and part-work and part-study.
    Over the past sixteen years, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Production and Construction Corps have kept Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind. While striving to carry out the task of a shock team in borderland production and construction, they have also played the great role that a working team should play. They have continuously sent cadres to help people of all ethnic groups carry out democratic reforms, develop and consolidate the collective economy, and provide strong assistance to the local people's communes in terms of materials and technology, further consolidating and strengthening national unity. At the same time, the Corps also handed over its more than 200 large and small factories and shops and more than 200 vehicles, which it had built with hard work, to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang free of charge, and also participated in the construction of highways, railways, etc. in Xinjiang, making contributions to Xinjiang's socialist construction. In 1964 and 1965, the farms of the Corps adopted the method of linking up with the surrounding communes, and sent working teams to help some communes in 58 counties and cities survey and plan more than 7 million mu of farmland, build more than 160 kilometers of cement and cobblestone canals, and a large number of water conservancy engineering constructions. At present, all the people's communes in Xinjiang are taking the Corps as the direction, combining their own characteristics, and engaging in large-scale farmland capital construction, marching towards the broad road of building a new socialist countryside.
