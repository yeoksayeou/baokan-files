    Bringing Mao Zedong Thought, the Traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and the Nanniwan Spirit to the Borderlands
    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Makes Great Contributions to Borderland Construction
    Working hard to run socialist large-scale agriculture, truly achieving comprehensive integration of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; self-reliantly running industry, finance and trade, and cultural and educational undertakings, gradually forming a prosperous situation of comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor; actively assisting people of all ethnic groups in carrying out democratic reforms and developing the collective economy, making contributions to Xinjiang's socialist construction.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 13) The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, following Chairman Mao's teachings and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of Nanniwan, have made tremendous contributions in the construction of the borderlands, setting a brilliant example for the Chinese people in self-reliantly changing the poor and blank state of affairs.
    This Production and Construction Corps, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying forward the glorious tradition of arduous struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has, over the past sixteen years, opened up wasteland, built farmland, constructed water conservancy projects, carved roads through mountains, and built factories on many uninhabited Gobi deserts in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, relying on tenacious will and diligent hands. To date, it has reclaimed and transformed over ten million mu of original desert into fertile land with crisscrossing canals and dense forest belts, built a large number of modern large-scale farms and ranches, and established a complete set of industrial enterprises. The entire corps has become a production and construction army that comprehensively develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the main focus. This contingent, with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang as close as fish and water, closely cooperates to change the face of the border areas with each passing day.
    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that entered Xinjiang in the winter of 1949. This heroic unit, which had been tested by war and had performed many meritorious services for the people, began to fight to open up wasteland, build farmland, construct water conservancy projects, and transform the Gobi desert from the time it entered Xinjiang, following Chairman Mao's teachings that the people's army is not only a fighting force, but also a working force and a production force. In 1952, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, this unit collectively transferred some of its commanders and fighters to agricultural construction units and engineering construction units. Soon, the Central Government decided to form the troops participating in production and construction into a corps, and conferred the glorious title of Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Central Government also issued a historically significant order for this purpose. From then on, all the commanders and fighters of the Production and Construction Corps, with even higher revolutionary spirit, launched a large-scale, vigorous, and solid production movement.
    The great achievements created by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in building the borderland over the past sixteen years are a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for the Nanniwan spirit.
    Sixteen years ago, when the troops entered the various reclamation areas in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, it was still a desolate Gobi desert. Drought, wind, sand, salt, and alkali were formidable enemies that the soldiers often encountered. After sixteen years of arduous struggle, the farms of the Corps have built main canals totaling more than 40,000 kilometers in length and dozens of reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than one billion cubic meters, drawing water from dozens of rivers for irrigation. In some areas lacking surface water, well irrigation has also been carried out, and well-irrigated farms have been built. The farmland of the farms has been leveled into strip fields according to the plan, which is convenient for both mechanized farming and management. Around the strip fields, the roads are straight, the canals are crisscrossed, and the forest networks are dense, and the originally dry and harsh desert climate is changing. The main operations of the farms, from plowing and sowing to harvesting and threshing, have mostly been mechanized. In recent years, the output and commercial rate of various agricultural products have been increasing, fully demonstrating the superiority of socialist large-scale agriculture.
    The farms of the Corps have also truly achieved a comprehensive combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The existing hundreds of thousands of mu of forest belts in the entire Corps not only ensure the continuous increase in agricultural production and accumulate a large amount of timber, but also create good conditions for intercropping forests and grasslands and realizing the integration of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. At present, in addition to more than 20 ranches engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, each farm in the Corps also adopts methods such as setting up pens in the fields and grazing in the forests to raise livestock, using livestock to nourish the fields, and using the fields to raise livestock, so that the number of various livestock grows rapidly. All farms near rivers, lakes, and reservoirs operate fisheries. The farms and production teams generally develop sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Due to the development of diversified operations, the annual output value of many farms and production teams outside of agriculture can account for 30 to 40 percent of the total output value, which promotes a substantial increase in agriculture, and there are profits to be turned over every year.
    Since 1950, the Production and Construction Corps has carried forward the Nanniwan spirit and, according to the needs of production and life, raised funds and built a number of small-scale industries such as agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, agricultural product processing, coal mines, power stations, and brick, tile, clothing, and food industries. Since 1958, it has also self-reliantly built large- and medium-sized industries such as iron and steel, machinery, cement, chemical, textile, sugar making, paper making, and leather making. The variety of products has expanded from dozens to thousands, and the total industrial output value has increased by more than two times compared with 1957.
    These industrial enterprises, not only are the small factories built by the soldiers themselves, making their own equipment, and relying on their own accumulation, but also many large- and medium-sized factories are also built self-reliantly by first using indigenous methods and then foreign methods, using small industries to support large industries, and adopting the method of building, producing, accumulating, and expanding simultaneously. Most of the mechanical equipment of the August 1st Sugar Factory, with an annual output of more than 20,000 tons, is provided by the Corps' own industrial enterprises. During the preparatory stage of the August 1st Wool Textile Factory, the soldiers first engaged in wool yarn production, and after accumulating funds, they built their own factory buildings and purchased their own equipment, with the actual expenditure accounting for only two-fifths of the required investment. Before some chemical plants were built, the soldiers were mobilized to collect mirabilite on the alkali滩and use the accumulation from the mirabilite production as funds to expand into chemical plants.
    Due to the rapid development of industry, the pig iron, cement, various semi-mechanized farm implements and animal-powered farm implements, and some building materials needed in agriculture can now be basically self-sufficient, small steel products, fertilizers, pesticides, and spare parts for automobiles and tractors can be partially self-sufficient, and the problems of agricultural machinery repair and parts and agricultural and livestock product processing can all be solved locally. Because the variety and specifications of these products are right, the supply is timely, they meet the special needs of their own farms, and they can be supplied locally, reducing transportation costs, which not only guarantees increased agricultural production, but also greatly reduces agricultural costs. At the same time, it has also accumulated a large amount of funds for industry. From 1955 to 1964, the profits turned over by the entire Corps in industry alone, in addition to meeting the investment required for the development of industry itself, can also build more than 3 million mu of stable and high-yield farmland with water conservancy, mechanization, and landscaping.
    The Production and Construction Corps also runs finance and trade, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., self-reliantly. After more than ten years of arduous struggle, a prosperous situation of comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, has gradually formed. The places where farms are concentrated have become political, economic, and cultural centers. These centers equip the nearby farms with excellent agricultural production materials and modern science and technology, and the surrounding farms continuously supply the factories with rich raw materials.
    It is extremely convenient to implement the labor system of both industry and agriculture. During the busy farming season, a large number of workers go to the agricultural front line to participate in labor. Textile workers pick cotton in the cotton fields; sugar workers manage sugar beets in the fields; mechanical workers go deep into the fields to repair agricultural machinery.... Every worker is not only a shock worker in industrial construction, but also can skillfully engage in agricultural labor. In the slack farming season, the soldiers of the farm also go to the factory to participate in auxiliary labor. The cadres of the organs have also developed a good habit of participating in labor.
    The schools here are all run by the farms, production teams, and factories and mines themselves. The schools are located on the production base, which is conducive to the combination of teaching and productive labor. Every year, these schools create a large number of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture for the farms. The establishment of these schools provides extremely favorable conditions for implementing part-farming and part-study, and part-work and part-study.
    Over the past sixteen years, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Production and Construction Corps have kept Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind. While striving to carry out the task of a shock team in borderland production and construction, they have also played the great role that a working team should play. They have continuously sent cadres to help people of all ethnic groups carry out democratic reforms, develop and consolidate the collective economy, and provide strong assistance to the local people's communes in terms of materials and technology, further consolidating and strengthening national unity. At the same time, the Corps also handed over its more than 200 large and small factories and shops and more than 200 vehicles, which it had built with hard work, to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang free of charge, and also participated in the construction of highways, railways, etc. in Xinjiang, making contributions to Xinjiang's socialist construction. In 1964 and 1965, the farms of the Corps adopted the method of linking up with the surrounding communes, and sent working teams to help some communes in 58 counties and cities survey and plan more than 7 million mu of farmland, build more than 160 kilometers of cement and cobblestone canals, and a large number of water conservancy engineering constructions. At present, all the people's communes in Xinjiang are taking the Corps as the direction, combining their own characteristics, and engaging in large-scale farmland capital construction, marching towards the broad road of building a new socialist countryside.

    把毛泽东思想、解放军传统和南泥湾精神带到边疆
    新疆建设兵团为建设边疆作大贡献
    艰苦奋斗，办社会主义大农业，真正作到了农林牧副渔全面结合；自力更生办工业、办财贸和文教事业，逐渐形成了以农业为基础，以工业为主导，工农兵学商全面发展的繁荣局面；积极帮助各族人民进行民主改革和发展集体经济，为新疆社会主义建设作出了贡献。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐十三日电　新疆生产建设兵团广大指战员遵循毛主席的教导，发扬南泥湾的革命传统，在建设边疆中作出巨大贡献，为我国人民自力更生改变一穷二白的面貌树立了光辉的榜样。
    这支用毛泽东思想武装起来的生产建设兵团，发扬中国人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，十六年来在天山南北许多处荒无人迹的戈壁滩上，凭着顽强的毅力和勤劳的双手，开荒造田，兴修水利，劈山筑路，兴建工厂。到目前为止，已把一千多万亩原始荒漠开垦改造成为渠道纵横、林带密布的良田，建成了一大批现代化的大型农场和牧场，建立了一整套工业企业。整个兵团，已经成为一支以农为主，农林牧副渔、工农兵学商全面发展的生产建设大军。这支队伍，与新疆境内的各族人民鱼水相亲，紧密配合，日新月异地改变着边疆地区的面貌。
    新疆生产建设兵团是一九四九年冬季进驻新疆的一支中国人民解放军部队。这支久经战火考验，为人民立过多次功勋的英雄部队，从进驻新疆起，就遵循毛主席关于人民军队既是战斗队，又是工作队，也是生产队的教导，展开了开荒造田、兴修水利、改造戈壁荒滩的斗争。一九五二年，这支部队根据毛主席的指示，把一部分指战员集体转业为农业建设部队和工程建设部队。不久，中央决定把参加生产建设的部队编成一个兵团，授以中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设兵团的光荣称号。中央还为此颁发了具有历史意义的命令。从此，生产建设兵团的全体指战员，以更加高昂的革命斗志，掀起了一个规模更大、气势更壮的轰轰烈烈扎扎实实的大生产运动。
    新疆生产建设兵团十六年来在建设边疆中创造的伟大成绩，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是南泥湾精神的胜利。
    十六年前，当部队进入天山南北的各个垦区时，那里还是一片渺无人烟的戈壁滩。干旱，风沙，盐，碱，是战士们经常遇到的劲敌。经过十六年的艰苦奋斗，兵团各农场共修筑了总长四万多公里的主干渠道和库容十多亿立方米的几十座水库，引几十条河的水进行灌溉。在一些缺乏地面水的地区，还打井灌溉，建成了井灌农场。农场耕地都按规划平整为条田，既便于机耕，又便于管理。条田周围，道路笔直，渠道纵横，林网密布，原来干燥恶劣的荒漠气候正在改变。各农场从犁、播到收割、脱粒等主要作业，大都实现了机械化。近年来，各种农产品的产量和商品率都越来越高，充分显示了社会主义大农业的优越性。
    兵团农场还真正作到了农林牧副渔全面结合。全兵团现有的数十万亩林带，不仅保证农业连年增产，积蓄了大量木材，还为林草间作，实现农林牧结合创造了良好条件。目前全兵团除二十多个兼营农业的牧场外，各农场还采取地头设圈、林间放牧等办法，以畜养田，以田养畜，使各类牲畜迅速增长。所有靠近河流、湖泊、水库的农场都经营渔业。各农场和生产连队普遍因地制宜地大搞副业生产。不少农场和生产连队由于多种经营的开展，每年农业以外的产值可占总产值的百分之三四十，促进了农业大幅度增长，年年都有利润上交。
    从一九五○年以来，生产建设兵团就发扬南泥湾精神，根据生产和生活的需要，自筹资金，因陋就简地兴办了一批农机具修造、农产品加工、煤矿、电站和砖瓦、被服、食品等小型工业。一九五八年以来，又自力更生地兴办了钢铁、机械、水泥、化工、纺织、制糖、造纸、制革等大中型工业，产品品种由原来的几十种扩大到上千种，工业总产值比一九五七年增加了两倍多。
    这些工业企业，不仅小厂是战士们自盖厂房，自造设备，依靠自己的积累搞起来的，许多大中型工厂，也是先土后洋，以小养大，采取边建设、边生产、边积累、边扩大的办法，自力更生搞起来的。年产两万多吨的八一制糖厂，大部分机械设备是兵团工业自己企业提供的。八一毛纺厂在筹建期间，战士们就先搞毛线生产，等资金积累起来以后，再自建厂房、自购设备，实际花费只占所需投资的五分之二。有些化工厂在兴建以前，就发动战士们在碱滩上采集芒硝，用芒硝生产的积累作资金，扩建成化工厂。
    由于工业迅速发展起来，现在农业上需要的生铁、水泥、各种半机械化农具和畜力农具以及部分建筑材料已可基本自给，小型钢材、化肥、农药以及汽车和拖拉机的配件可以部分自给，农机具修配和农畜产品加工问题全部可以就地解决。由于这些产品的品种规格对路，供应及时，适应自己农场的特殊需要，并能作到就地供应，减少运费，既保证了农业增产，又大大降低了农业成本。同时还为工业积累了大量资金。全兵团在一九五五年至一九六四年仅工业上交的利润，除能满足工业本身发展所需的投资外，还可建成三百多万亩水利化、机械化、园林化的稳产高产农田。
    生产建设兵团还自力更生地办财贸和文教等事业。经过十几年的艰苦奋斗，逐渐形成了以农业为基础，以工业为主导，工农兵学商全面发展的繁荣局面。农场集中的地方，已经成为政治、经济、文化的中心。这些中心以优良的农业生产资料和现代科学技术装备着就近的农场，周围农场也以丰富的原料源源供应各工厂。
    这里极便于实行亦工亦农的劳动制度。每当农忙季节，都有大批工人到农业第一线参加劳动。纺织工人到棉田拾棉；制糖工人到田间管理甜菜；机械工人深入到田边地头修理农机具……。每个工人不仅是工业建设的突击手，而且能熟练地从事农业劳动。农闲季节，农场战士也到工厂参加辅助劳动。机关干部也养成了参加劳动的良好风尚。
    这里的学校都是农场、生产连队和厂矿企业自己办起来的。学校就办在生产基地上，有利于作到教学与生产劳动相结合。每年，这些学校都为各农场造就大批有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这些学校的建立，为实行半耕半读、半工半读提供了极为有利的条件。
    十六年来，生产建设兵团广大指战员牢记毛主席的教导，在努力执行边疆生产建设突击队任务的同时，还起到了工作队应有的巨大作用。他们不断派出干部帮助各族人民进行民主改革，发展和巩固集体经济，从物质上技术上给予当地人民公社以大力帮助，进一步巩固和加强了民族团结。同时，兵团还将自己辛勤建设起来的二百多处大小工厂和商店，二百多辆汽车，全部无偿地交给了新疆各族人民，还参加了新疆的公路、铁路等建设，为新疆社会主义建设事业作出了贡献。一九六四年和一九六五年，兵团各农场采取与周围公社挂钩的办法，派出工作队帮助五十八个县市的部分公社勘察和规划了七百多万亩农田，兴修水泥和卵石渠道一百六十多公里，以及大量的水利工程建筑。目前，全疆各人民公社都以兵团为方向，结合自身特点，大搞农田基本建设，向着建设社会主义新农村的康庄大道迈进。
