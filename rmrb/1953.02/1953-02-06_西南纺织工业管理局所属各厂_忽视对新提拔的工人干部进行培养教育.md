The factories under the Southwest Textile Industry Administration have many problems in the work of promoting and training worker cadres.

The textile factories under the Southwest Textile Industry Administration have successively promoted a large number of outstanding workers to participate in production management and administrative management work. These worker cadres are generally active and enthusiastic, able to endure hardship and work hard, and are conscientious and responsible. Many newly promoted workshop directors actively study their work beyond the prescribed working hours every day in order to quickly become familiar with their business and do their job well. After these outstanding workers participated in management work, they strengthened the connection between leaders and the masses, enabling many problems in the factory to be solved in a timely manner, and also eliminated some of the barriers that existed between factory staff and workers in the past.

However, the leadership of each factory has serious shortcomings in the work of promoting and training worker cadres. Before promoting these new cadres, repeated mobilization and education work was not carried out, and the ideological concerns of the new cadres were not persuaded and educated in a timely manner. The factories did not give the new cadres the opportunity to learn their jobs in advance. Some factories even promoted workers to new positions without prior notice, simply calling them out of the workshop, leaving the promoted workers feeling baffled.

After workers are promoted to cadres, the factories generally use them more and train them less. The personnel departments believe that the "task" has been completed after the promotion, and they no longer care about them. Many newly promoted worker cadres have repeatedly requested to hold symposiums for new cadres to exchange experiences, or to provide opportunities for cultural and professional learning, but the leaders of the factories have adopted a bureaucratic attitude of indifference. The personnel sections of each factory have not yet formulated a plan for training new cadres, pushing the responsibility for training worker cadres to the trade union, and the trade union is only responsible for the political and cultural education of workers, so no one is responsible for the professional education of worker cadres. Although the party committees of each factory are also aware of this situation, they have never held a meeting to specifically study this issue. When newly promoted worker cadres encounter difficulties in their work, the leading cadres not only do not patiently help solve them, but some even criticize them severely for any shortcomings. For example, Yang Zhenrui, a newly promoted worker cadre in the knife grinding team of the 614 Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory, was criticized by the factory director for "not caring about production and having ideological problems" once when he failed to complete the knife grinding tools in a timely manner.

Some factories use newly promoted worker cadres extremely inappropriately, thus wasting talent. For example, Shen Zhankui, an old technical worker in the turbine workshop of the power section of the 611 Yarn Factory, was transferred to the supply section as a procurement staff after the "Three-Anti" campaign. Some departments do not assign work to new cadres, treating them as odd-job workers. The head of the general affairs section of the 614 Factory simply refused to accept worker cadres who were transferred. Excellent workers with prestige among the masses, after being promoted to cadres, have taken on four or five concurrent positions, some even more than ten, and are often busy attending various meetings, with little time to study their work, which has a great impact on their work and health. In addition, some technicians have a bad attitude towards newly promoted worker cadres, not only not helping them solve the difficulties they encounter in their new positions, but also ridiculing them. These problems have not been resolved by the leadership in a timely manner.

Due to the above reasons, the newly promoted worker cadres in the textile factories under the Southwest Textile Industry Administration generally have pessimistic and disappointed negative emotions. Some people think that their cultural level is low and they are not familiar with their work. They are model workers and advanced workers in production positions, but they cannot play their role after being promoted to cadres. Many newly promoted workshop administrators and workshop directors stand in the workshop, not knowing how to work. As a result, the new cadres in the roving frame room have to help with piecing ends; the new cadres in the spinning room have to help with winding and carrying bags; and the new cadres in the reeling room have to help pick yarn balls. Many newly promoted worker cadres are asking to return to the workshop. Some workers also believe that after becoming cadres, they can no longer create advanced working methods, they can no longer be model workers, and they no longer have the opportunity to go to the Soviet Union and Beijing, so they believe that being a cadre is not glorious. On the other hand, due to insufficient education, some worker cadres have gradually developed complacency. The 27 administrators promoted from workers in the 610 Yarn Factory were originally excellent workers, but after working for a few months, they gradually became detached from the masses and rarely took care of the difficulties of workers in production and life, causing great dissatisfaction among the workers.

The leaders of the Southwest Textile Industry Administration should immediately take effective steps to solve the above problems.

### 西南纺织工业管理局所属各厂  忽视对新提拔的工人干部进行培养教育

    西南纺织工业管理局所属各厂
    忽视对新提拔的工人干部进行培养教育
    西南纺织工业管理局所属各纺织厂提拔和培养工人干部的工作中，存在很多问题。
    西南纺织工业管理局所属各纺织厂曾先后提拔了大批优秀工人参加生产管理和行政管理工作。这些工人干部，一般都积极热情，能吃苦耐劳，认真负责。许多新提拔的车间主任为了迅速熟悉业务，做好工作，每天都在规定的工作时间以外积极钻研业务。这些优秀工人参加了管理工作以后，密切了领导和群众的联系，使工厂中许多问题都能得到及时解决，同时也消除了许多厂职员和工人之间过去存在的一些隔阂。
    但是各厂领导方面在提拔和培养工人干部的工作中却存在着严重缺点。在提拔这些新干部以前没有进行反复的动员教育工作，对新干部的思想顾虑也没有及时进行说服教育。各厂事先也没有给新干部以学习业务的机会。有些厂甚至不事先通知，临时把工人从车间里喊出来，就要他担任新职务，使被提拔的工人感到莫名其妙。
    工人被提拔成干部以后，各厂普遍是使用多，培养少。人事部门认为提拔起来以后“任务”已经完成，也就不再关心他们。许多新提拔的工人干部再三要求召开新干部座谈会交流经验，或给以文化、业务学习的机会，但各厂领导方面竟采取不闻不问的官僚主义态度。各厂的人事科至今都没有订出一个培养新干部的计划，把培养工人干部的责任推给工会，工会又只管工人的政治文化教育，这样工人干部的业务教育就无人负责。各厂党委虽也了解这种情况，但从未开会专门研究过这个问题。新提拔的工人干部在工作中遇到困难，领导干部不但不耐心帮助解决，有的反而一有缺点，即大肆批评。如六一四纺织机器制造厂磨刀组新提拔的工人干部杨振瑞，有一次没有及时完成磨刀工具，厂长就批评他“不关心生产，思想有问题。”
    有些厂对新提拔的工人干部使用极不恰当，因而浪费了人材。如六一一纱厂原动部透平车间的老技术工人申占魁，“三反”后调到供应科当采购员。有些部门不给新干部分配工作，把他们当作打杂工人。六一四厂总务科负责人见调工人干部来，干脆拒绝不要。在群众中有威望的优秀工人，提拔当干部以后，便都担任了四、五种兼职，有的甚至兼职十种以上，经常忙于出席各种会议，很少有时间学习业务，对工作和健康都影响很大。另外，有的技术人员对新提拔的工人干部态度不好，不但不帮助他们解决到新岗位上来碰到的困难，有的反而加以冷嘲热讽。这些问题，领导方面也没有及时加以解决。
    由于以上种种原因，目前西南纺织工业管理局所属各纺织厂新提拔的工人干部，普遍滋长着悲观失望的消极情绪。有些人认为自己文化低，业务不熟悉，在生产岗位上是劳动模范、先进工作者，但提拔为干部后反发挥不了作用。许多新提拔的车间管理员和车间主任站在车间里，不知如何工作。结果是粗纱间的新干部只好帮着接头；细纱间的新干部只好帮助络纱、牵口袋；摇纱间的新干部就帮助拣纱团。许多新提拔的工人干部要求仍回车间去。也有些工人认为当了干部后，再也不能创造先进工作法，再也不能当劳动模范，再也没有机会去苏联和北京了，因此认为当干部不光荣。另一方面，由于对他们教育不够，有的工人干部逐渐产生了骄傲自满情绪。六一○纱厂从工人中提拔起来的二十七个管理员，原来都是优秀工人，但工作了几个月以后，逐渐脱离群众，对工人生产上、生活上的困难很少照顾，引起工人很大不满。
    以上这些问题，西南纺织工业管理局领导方面应即采取有效步骤加以解决。
