Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th dispatch: Discontent continues to be expressed both inside and outside the British Parliament regarding the American attempts to drag Britain further into the Far East aggression mire.

In answering the numerous accusations from members of Parliament in the House of Commons on the 3rd, British Foreign Secretary Eden admitted that Eisenhower's decision would bring "unfortunate" consequences to the American-British aggression group. However, he tried his best to portray the matter as unrelated to Britain. Moreover, in order not to offend Dulles and Stassen, Eisenhower's two special envoys who were visiting Britain at that time, he requested the parliamentarians to "not talk too much."

However, the danger to British actual interests that would result from the American plot to expand aggression in the Far East has caused even old-line pro-American Labour leaders like Morrison to express dissatisfaction with the American president's arbitrary behavior. He complained that Eisenhower had failed to fulfill the "cooperation" between the United States and Britain that he was constantly talking about. After mentioning the "consequences" and "new troubles" that Eisenhower's reckless actions might cause, he said that if the United States were to repeat this situation, Britain could not hold the same attitude as the United States.

Outside of Parliament, unofficial British bourgeois public opinion continued to express obvious resentment towards the behavior of the American "partner." Labour leader Bevan delivered a speech, believing that Eisenhower's actions would weaken the ties between Britain and the United States. He linked the American actions with the Korean armistice negotiations, believing that the United States was undermining the armistice negotiations due to its own "strategic considerations," and not genuinely for the benefit of the prisoners of war; and for the same considerations, the United States was unwilling to return Taiwan to the Chinese people.

Labour MP Woodrow Wyatt accused Eisenhower of violating the so-called spirit of "cooperation" and simply issuing orders. He said that if such American actions were not stopped immediately, a "rift" would occur in Anglo-American relations.

The Sunday Pictorial, with a circulation of millions of copies, published an open letter to Eisenhower regarding Eisenhower's State of the Union address, criticizing Eisenhower for making decisions involving Britain's major interests "without proper consultation, and disregarding British protests."

However, the British ruling group, with the American noose around its neck, is still determined to follow the United States. When Eden spoke in the House of Commons on the 5th, he shamelessly defended the British government's ugly behavior of following the United States, and said that he might "reach a full and harmonious agreement" with Dulles on the Taiwan issue. He shamelessly said that the American occupation of Taiwan and its use as a base for attacking the Chinese mainland did not contain any aggressive intent, but he himself admitted that he had not received any promises or guarantees from Dulles.

Regarding Eden's behavior, Labour MP Donnelly made a vivid comment, saying that Eden was "a horse in political clothing serving American actions."

    美国要把英国进一步拖进远东侵略泥淖
    引起英国统治集团内部激烈争吵
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会内外对美国人要把英国进一步拉进远东侵略泥淖的做法继续表示极为不满。
    英国外交大臣艾登三日在下院答复议员的纷纷发出的责难中，承认艾森豪威尔的决定会替美英侵略集团招致“不幸的”后果，但又竭力想把这事说成和英国无关，并且为了不得罪恰在这时来到英国的两位艾森豪威尔的钦差大臣杜勒斯和史塔生，他还请求议员们“不要多说话”。
    但英国实际利益将因美国扩大远东侵略的阴谋而受到的危险却使得即使是像摩里逊这样的老牌亲美的工党领袖也对美国总统的专断行为表示了不满。他抱怨艾森豪威尔未履行口口声声讲的美英的“合作”。他在提到艾森豪威尔的冒失行动可能造成的“后果”和“新的麻烦”之后说，如果美国万一再发生这种情况，英国就不能和美国持同一态度。
    在议会外面，英国资产阶级非官方的舆论对美国“伙计”的行为继续明显地表示怨恨。工党领袖比万发表演说，认为艾森豪威尔的行动将削弱英美之间的联系。他把美国的行动和朝鲜停战谈判连系起来，认为美国是由于本身“战略上的考虑”，并不是真正为了战俘的利益而破坏停战谈判；并且由于同一考虑，所以美国不愿意把台湾归还中国人民。
    工党议员伍德罗·怀阿特牧师指责艾森豪威尔违背所谓“合作”精神，一味发号施令。他说，美国这种行动如不立即停止，英美关系将发生“裂痕”。
    销行数百万份的星期日画报就艾森豪威尔的国情咨文发表一封致艾森豪威尔的公开信，责备艾森豪威尔“不经适当的商量，撇开英国的抗议”就作出牵涉英国主要利益的决定。
    但是脖子上套着美国索子的英国统治集团还是决心跟着美国走。艾登五日在下院发言时，厚着脸皮替英国政府追随美国的丑态辩护，并说他可能和杜勒斯就台湾问题“获得充分和睦的协议”。他无耻地说美国侵占台湾并利用它作为进攻中国大陆的基地不包含侵略意图，但他自己又承认他未从杜勒斯那里得到任何许诺或保证。
    关于艾登的这种行为，工党议员唐纳利作了一个生动的评论，他说艾登是“替美国行动服务的一匹穿着政治外衣的马”。
