Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: People from all walks of life in Shanghai and Tianjin have launched a Spring Festival campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs. The trade union of Shanghai State-Owned No. 14 Cotton Textile Factory and other units have organized comfort groups, bringing New Year's goods such as cured meat, rice cakes, and vermicelli, and going to various places to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers with gongs and drums. More than 20 famous calligraphers and painters, including Shen Yinmo, Shen Maishi, and Deng Sanmu, have collectively written more than 100 Spring Festival couplets and horizontal inscribed boards with "Glorious Family," as Spring Festival gifts for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Residents in many neighborhoods throughout the city have begun carrying out Spring Festival cleaning for the families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor. The district people's governments are actively distributing preferential treatment grain allowances to families of martyrs and soldiers, preparing to complete the distribution by February 10, so that families of martyrs and soldiers with relatively difficult lives throughout the city can spend the Spring Festival peacefully. People from all walks of life are writing letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front and the Korean People's Army. The Shanghai Branch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea Association received 693 letters of condolence in the three days from February 1 to February 3. The letters also included various gifts expressing respect.
    Various districts in Tianjin have generally held symposiums, using blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, and plays to publicize the important significance of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs. Citizens in the Second and Fourth Districts have organized preferential treatment groups to visit families of martyrs and soldiers door to door, and voluntarily help families of martyrs and soldiers to clean houses and wash clothes. More than 600 women in the Seventh District have organized themselves to sew and mend clothes for the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin. Starting from the 9th, all districts in the city will widely launch activities to comfort and extend regards to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin and the families of martyrs and soldiers. Many factories, institutions, and schools will hold get-togethers with soldiers and families of martyrs and soldiers to welcome the arrival of the Spring Festival.

    上海、天津两地
    积极进行春节拥军优属工作
    据新华社讯：上海、天津两市各界人民已展开春节拥军优属工作。上海国营第十四棉纺织厂工会等单位已组织慰问队，带了腊肉、年糕、粉丝等年货，敲锣打鼓，分赴各处慰问烈、军属。名书画家沈尹默、沈迈士、邓散木等二十多人，已集体书写了春联和“光荣人家”的横额一百多件，作为送给烈、军属的春节礼物。全市很多里弄的居民们已开始为缺少劳动力的烈、军属家庭进行春节大扫除。各区区人民政府现正积极发放烈、军属优待粮代金，准备在二月十日发放完毕，使全市生活比较贫苦的烈、军属安度春节。各界人民正在纷纷写信给朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。上海市抗美援朝分会在二月一日到三日的三天中，就收到慰问信六百九十三封。信中还附寄了各种表示敬意的礼物。
    天津市各区普遍举行了座谈会，采用黑板报、大字报、演剧等方式，宣传拥军优属工作的重要意义。第二、四区的市民分别组织了优抚小组，挨户访问烈、军属，并自动帮助烈、军属打扫房屋，拆洗衣服。第七区的妇女已有六百多人组织起来，分别给人民解放军驻津部队缝补衣服。自九日起，全市各区将广泛展开慰劳、慰问人民解放军驻津部队和烈、军属的活动。许多工厂、机关、学校将与部队战士和烈、军属举行联欢，迎接春节的来临。
