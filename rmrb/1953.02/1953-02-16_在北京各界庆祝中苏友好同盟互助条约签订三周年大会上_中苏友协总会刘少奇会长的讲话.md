Dear Comrades!

Today we gather here to celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This is a day of celebration for all the people of China and the Soviet Union, and a day of celebration for all peace-loving people around the world.

Three years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his farewell speech in the Soviet Union after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: “The full understanding and deep friendship established between us on the basis of the fundamental interests of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, is beyond description. People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world."

It has been three years since the signing of this great treaty. The facts of the past three years have fully demonstrated that the friendship and unity between the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which have been fixed by the treaty, have been further developed and consolidated. This friendship and unity has not only had a tremendous impact on the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but also has had a tremendous impact on the victory of peace and justice in the world. As time goes on, people will see more and more clearly what a tremendous impact the friendship and unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, fixed by this treaty, will have on the people of the two countries and even on all mankind.

As everyone knows, the main goal of signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is to: "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggressive acts." At that time, people seemed to think that the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that colluded with Japan in aggressive acts were not so realistic, and therefore, they ignored the great significance of signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in this regard. At that time, some people said, "Why use a sword to kill a chicken?" These people seemed to think that after the defeat of Japanese imperialism in World War II, it had become "a chicken" and could no longer rise again. Its re-aggression and the re-aggression of countries that colluded with it were impossible. There was no need to use a sword to kill a chicken. Then why should the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, sign a solemn treaty to jointly prevent its resurgence and its re-aggression?

However, these people were obviously wrong. Not long after, the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, based in Japan and rearming Japan, was launched, and it forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan. Then, the illegal and unilateral San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," which aimed at reviving Japanese militarism and carrying out aggression, were also signed. The Japanese reactionary government and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan also signed the so-called "peace treaty." Japanese militarism is beginning to revive and has begun to rearm. Some countries are also attempting to sign the aggressive so-called Pacific Pact with Japanese militarism as a pawn. All these facts prove that preventing the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan has extremely serious practical significance.

Obviously, as far as the current situation in the Far East is concerned, as long as Japanese imperialism cannot rise again and cannot launch a war of aggression, it is difficult for other countries in Asia to launch a war. And American imperialism and any other imperialism, without Japan as a base for aggressive war, without the support and help of the Japanese reactionary rulers, and without the vast Japanese manpower being used to serve the aggressive war and act as cannon fodder, it is impossible to carry out a large-scale war of aggression in the Far East. Therefore, it can be said that as long as it is possible to "stop the re-aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive acts," then peace in the Far East will be guaranteed. Therefore, it is completely reasonable for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance to take this as its main goal in order to guarantee peace in the Far East and the world.

The current situation is that, on the one hand, Japanese imperialism is attempting to rise again and attempting to reinitiate aggression under the slogan of revanchism; on the other hand, American imperialism is in the process of rearming Japan, reviving Japanese militarism, and reviving this hotbed of World War II in the Far East. Therefore, preventing the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and preventing the re-aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or other countries that directly or indirectly collude with Japan in aggressive acts has become a more serious task for the people of the Far East and the world. And the great role and influence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in this regard has become even more apparent. It is precisely for this reason that Comrade Stalin said: The Sino-Soviet alliance "is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world."

Now people can clearly see that it is precisely because of this treaty, and because of the friendly alliance between the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, that we were able to victoriously carry out the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, causing American imperialism to suffer tremendous defeats and difficulties in Korea, thereby disrupting and postponing the timetable of American imperialism's war of aggression against the world. This proves what Comrade Mao Zedong said: that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, has already had a tremendous impact on the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, and on the victory of peace and justice in the world. And in the future, it will continue to have a tremendous impact.

As everyone knows, another goal of signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is to "ensure the development and consolidation of economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union in a spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, to provide each other with all possible economic assistance, and to conduct necessary economic cooperation." The facts of the past three years have also fully proved that these relations between the two countries, which have been fixed by the treaty, have been greatly developed and consolidated. This has had a tremendous impact on the prosperity of the two countries, especially on the recovery and development of China's economy.

At the same time as the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, an agreement on lending to the People's Republic of China was signed, with the Soviet Union lending 300 million U.S. dollars to China at a preferential interest rate of 1%. This provided important assistance to China's economy, which had been damaged at the time.

In addition, agreements were signed on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, deciding to transfer all rights of the Chinese Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway to China free of charge no later than the end of 1952, and deciding that Soviet troops would withdraw from the Lushunkou naval base no later than the end of 1952. Now all the property of the Chinese Changchun Railway has been transferred to China free of charge. This railway has now become the best-managed railway in China, because it is managed using advanced Soviet methods. As for the Lushunkou naval base, the term of joint use has been extended at the request of the Chinese government, and Soviet troops are still responsible for the defense of the Lushunkou area. All of these indicate that the Soviet Union is faithfully and earnestly fulfilling its obligations of alliance and mutual assistance.

The agreements between China and the Soviet Union on jointly developing petroleum and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang and on jointly developing civil aviation between China and the Soviet Union have been implemented, and these jointly operated enterprises are now working smoothly.

Trade between China and the Soviet Union has also greatly developed in the past three years. In 1952, China's exports to the Soviet Union accounted for 54 percent of the total value of all our exported goods, while imports accounted for 53 percent. It is worth mentioning here that a portion of China's exports to the Soviet Union are industrial raw materials, while the vast majority are agricultural products, while the vast majority of goods imported from the Soviet Union are machinery, complete sets of equipment, and other important industrial transportation equipment. Trade between our two countries occupies an extremely important position in the composition of the new democratic world market.

The Soviet Union has provided great technical assistance to the recovery and development of our country's economy. There are now many experienced Soviet design experts and technical experts working in various economic organs and enterprises in our country. They have a high degree of internationalist spirit and have enthusiastically and unreservedly helped the Chinese people in their construction work, and have technically solved many important problems in our country's production undertakings. Many important factories in our country have been newly built, renovated, and expanded, and other construction projects have been designed by Soviet experts. This has accelerated the recovery and development of our country's economy.

Cultural relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union have also greatly developed in the past three years.

In the past three years, China has sent 22 delegations to the Soviet Union, where they conducted various visits and studies. The Soviet Union has sent 18 delegations to China, and they have made contact with the broad masses of the Chinese people. In particular, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month from November to mid-December last year, four Soviet delegations totaling 300 people came to China, and they conducted activities and performances in 26 cities in China. They held 158 lectures and forums for people from all walks of life in China, with 170,000 listeners, performed 142 shows with 900,000 viewers, and broadcast 22 conferences, with more than 25 million listeners. The film delegation met with 50 times and 110,000 people. During that month, Soviet films were screened in 67 cities in China, with more than 100 million viewers.

In the past three years, China has translated and published thousands of Soviet books. In the Soviet Union, more than 100 Chinese books have been translated into 16 languages, and 4 to 5 million copies of books about China have been published. One hundred and twenty Soviet films have been translated into Chinese languages, and these films have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people.

China has sent hundreds of students to study in the Soviet Union, and will send a large number of students to study in the Soviet Union in the future. Many Soviet professors have been teaching in Chinese universities. The curriculum of Chinese schools will also be gradually reformed using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

That is to say, cultural relations between our two countries have greatly developed, and will continue to develop in the future.

Due to these cultural exchanges and other needs, there has been a large upsurge in learning Russian among Chinese intellectuals, and the number of people learning Chinese in the Soviet Union has also increased. This will create more favorable conditions for the people of the two countries to have more extensive contact in the future.

The "development and consolidation of...economic and cultural relations, providing each other with all possible economic assistance, and conducting necessary economic cooperation" between our two countries has been carried out entirely in accordance with the spirit and principles stipulated in the treaty, that is, "both parties guarantee to proceed in a spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs." The economic assistance and economic cooperation between each other and the development of economic and cultural relations carried out under this spirit and principle have also confirmed what Comrade Mao Zedong said, that it has had a tremendous impact on the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, and on the victory of peace and justice in the world.

All the above facts prove that the friendship and unity between the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, has greatly developed in the past three years, and will continue to develop in the future. This friendship and unity is permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it, and it is invincible in the world.

Why can the friendship and unity between the people of our two countries have such development? Why is this friendship and unity permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it?

Because the friendship and mutual relations between our two countries are completely different from the mutual relations between capitalist countries in the past history. The relationship between our two countries is based on the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, is the mutual relationship between the two countries belonging to the people, is the brotherly relationship of mutual assistance, and is the mutual relationship between Stalin and Mao Zedong. In this kind of relationship, there is no such thing as the mutual deceit, mutual competition, mutual exclusion, mutual extortion, or one oppressing and plundering the other that are inevitable between capitalist countries. The mutual relationship between our two countries is just as Comrade Malenkov said: "It is an example of a completely new relationship between countries, a relationship that has never existed in history. The basis of this relationship is the principles of equality, economic cooperation, and respect for national independence. The Soviet Union adheres to its mutual assistance treaties and has provided and will continue to provide these countries (i.e., the people's democratic countries) with assistance and support so that these countries can be further consolidated and developed." This mutual relationship is also as Comrade Stalin said when discussing the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries: "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries genuine help and technically sophisticated help like the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is primarily the basis of this cooperation, which is the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic prosperity."

It is precisely because the mutual relationship between our two countries is such a relationship that the friendship and unity between the people of our two countries is permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it.

Among us communists and working people, the advanced always want to help the backward more. The Soviet Union is in an obviously advanced position among the people's democratic countries. Therefore, in terms of mutual assistance, the Soviet Union has always helped our country and other people's democratic countries more. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their sincere and selfless help to our country and people in all aspects.

Comrades! The Soviet Union is our model, our teacher. The road that the Soviet Union has taken is the road that we are now and will take in the future. Today, as we celebrate the continued strengthening of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, we must also put forward the task of learning from the Soviet Union.

From this year on, our country has entered a period of large-scale planned construction. In order to do a good job in the construction of our country, we must strive to learn from the Soviet Union, and we must regard humbly learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as one of the primary conditions for promoting the construction work of our country. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is within the Communist Party or outside the Communist Party, veteran cadres or new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, workers, or peasants, all must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch an upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." To this end, all organs, groups, factories, schools, rural areas, and People's Liberation Army units throughout the country should follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and earnestly launch a movement to learn from the Soviet Union to welcome our great national construction work.

The publication of Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the holding of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have provided invaluable help to the Chinese people in building their own country. The people of China have shown great enthusiasm for studying Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From these documents, everyone has correctly recognized the basic situation in the world today, recognized why our cause will inevitably be victorious, and what aspects and forces we must rely on to achieve victory. We should continue to deepen this study and thereby raise the nation's learning from the Soviet Union to a new stage.

With the assistance of the Soviet Union and the guidance of advanced Soviet ideology and experience, our construction cause will surely be victorious. Relying on the friendly unity and close cooperation of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, we will surely be able to completely defeat the imperialist plot of aggression.

Long live the great and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship alliance!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Comrade Stalin, the most beloved friend of the Chinese people, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

### 在北京各界庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年大会上  中苏友协总会刘少奇会长的讲话

    在北京各界庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年大会上
    中苏友协总会刘少奇会长的讲话亲爱的同志们！
    今天我们在这里集会，庆祝伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的三周年。这是全中国人民和全苏联人民一致庆祝的日子，也是全世界爱好和平的人民一致庆祝的日子。
    三年前，毛泽东同志在签订中苏友好同盟互助条约后离苏临别演说中说：“我们相互间在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利”。
    这个伟大的条约签订之后，到现在已经是三年了。三年来的事实已经充分证明：经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民之间的友谊和团结是更加发展和巩固了。这种友谊和团结，不但对中苏两大国的繁荣已经发生了巨大的影响，而且对于全世界的和平与正义的胜利也已经发生了巨大的影响。日子过得愈久，人们就可以愈加清楚地看到：经过这个条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的友谊和团结将要给予两国人民以至全人类以何等巨大的影响。
    大家都知道，签订中苏友好同盟互助条约的主要目标是：“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。在当时，人们对于日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略，似乎还以为不是那样具有现实的意义，因而，他们也就忽视签订中苏友好同盟互助条约在这一方面的重大意义。在那时，有人说过“割鸡焉用牛刀”的话。这些人似乎认为日本帝国主义在第二次世界大战中失败以后，已经变成了“一只鸡”，已经不能再起了，它以及和它相勾结的国家之重新侵略已经不可能了，杀鸡是不必用牛刀的，那又何必由中苏两大国签订一个庄严的条约来共同防止它的再起和它的重新侵略呢？
    但是，这些人显然是错了。时间过了不久，以日本为基地并进行重新武装日本的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争就发动了，而且强占了中国的领土台湾。接着，非法的片面的旧金山对日和约以及为着复活日本军国主义并以进行侵略为目的的“美日安全条约”也签订了。日本反动政府和台湾蒋匪帮的所谓“和约”也签订了。日本军国主义正在开始复活，并已开始重新武装了。若干国家还企图签订以日本军国主义为打手的侵略性的所谓太平洋公约。这一切事实，证明防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略是具有极为严重的现实意义的。
    很显然，就远东目前的形势来说，只要日本帝国主义不能再起，不能发动侵略战争，亚洲其他国家是难于发动战争的。而美帝国主义以及其他任何帝国主义，如果没有日本做为侵略战争的基地，如果没有日本反动统治者的支持和帮助，如果没有广大的日本人力被利用来为侵略战争服务和当炮灰，要在远东进行大规模的侵略战争是不可能的。因此，可以说，只要能够“制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”，那么，远东的和平就有了保证。因此，中苏友好同盟互助条约为了保证远东和世界的和平，以此作为它的主要目标，是完全有理由的。
    目前的形势，一方面，是日本帝国主义正在企图再起，并企图在复仇主义的口号下重新进行侵略；另一方面，是美帝国主义正在重新武装日本，复活日本的军国主义，复活这个第二次世界大战在远东的温床。因此，防止日本帝国主义之再起，防止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略和破坏和平，就成为远东和全世界人民更加严重的任务了。而中苏友好同盟互助条约在这一方面所起的巨大作用和影响，也就更加显示出来了。正因为如此，所以斯大林同志说：中苏友好同盟“是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    现在人们可以清楚地看到：正因为有了这个条约，有了中苏两大国的友好同盟，所以我们能够胜利地进行抗美援朝斗争，使美帝国主义在朝鲜遭到巨大的失败和困难，因而也就打乱了和推迟了美帝国主义侵略世界的战争的时间表。这就证明了毛泽东同志所说的，经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结，对于中苏两大国的繁荣以及对于全世界和平与正义的胜利，是已经发生了巨大的影响的。而在将来，则还会要继续发生巨大的影响。
    大家都知道，签订中苏友好同盟互助条约的另一个目标，是要“保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作”。三年来的事实也完全证明了：经过条约固定下来的两国之间的这些关系已经有了很大的发展和巩固。这对于两国的繁荣，特别是对于中国经济的恢复与发展，是有了极大的影响的。
    在签订中苏友好同盟互助条约的同时，签订了关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定，苏联以年利百分之一的优惠条件贷款三亿美元给中国。这就给了当时被破坏了的中国经济以重要的援助。
    此外，又签订了关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，决定将中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产，不迟于一九五二年末无偿地移交给中国，并决定苏联军队不迟于一九五二年末从旅顺口海军根据地撤退。现在中国长春铁路的全部财产已经无偿地移交给中国了。这条铁路，现在已成为全中国铁路中管理得最好的一条铁路，因为这条铁路是实行苏联先进办法来管理的。至于旅顺口海军根据地，则由于中国政府的请求延长了共同使用的期限，苏联军队仍然担负着旅顺口地区的防守任务。这些都表示苏联是在忠诚切实地履行它的同盟互助义务的。
    中国与苏联关于共同开发新疆的石油和有色金属的协定以及关于共同发展中苏间民用航空的协定，都已经实施了，现在这些共同经营的事业都正在顺利地进行工作。
    中苏两国的贸易，三年来，也有了极大的发展。一九五二年我国对苏联的出口，占我全部出口货物总值的百分之五十四，进口则占百分之五十三。这里值得说明一下的是：中国对苏联的出口，一部分是工业原料，绝大部分是农产品，而由苏联进口的货物，则绝大部分是机器、成套的装备以及其他重要的工业交通运输器材。我们两国之间的贸易在新的民主的世界市场的组成中是占有极重要的地位的。
    苏联对于我国经济的恢复和发展在技术方面给了极大的援助。现在已有许多有经验的苏联设计专家和技术专家在我国各经济机关和企业中工作着。他们具有高度的国际主义精神，热诚地、毫无保留地帮助了中国人民的建设工作，在技术上解决了我国生产事业中很多重要的问题。我国很多重要工厂的新建、改建和扩建以及其他建筑工程，是由苏联专家设计的。这样，就加快了我国经济的恢复和发展。
    中苏两国人民之间的文化关系，三年来，也有了很大的发展。
    在三年中，中国派到苏联去的代表团有二十二个，他们在苏联进行了各种参观和学习。由苏联派到中国的代表团，有十八个，他们和中国广大的人民进行了接触。特别是去年十一月至十二月中苏友好月中，有四个苏联代表团共三百人来中国，他们在中国的二十六个城市进行了活动与演出，他们在中国各地的各界人民中举行了讲演和座谈一百五十八次，听众十七万人，演出一百四十二场，观众九十万人，广播大会二十二次，收听群众有二千五百万人以上，其中的电影代表团有五十次和十一万人进行了会面。在那一个月中，苏联影片曾在中国六十七个城市中放映，观众在一亿人次以上。
    三年来，中国翻译和出版了几千种苏联书籍。在苏联用十六种文字翻译了中国书籍一百多种，出版了关于中国的书籍四五百万册。苏联的电影已有一百二十部译成了中国语言，这些影片受到广大的中国人民的热烈的欢迎。
    中国已经派了几百个学生到苏联学习，并将在以后还要派大批的学生到苏联去学习。不少的苏联教授已在中国的高等学校中教课。中国学校的课程也将采用苏联的先进经验逐步地加以改革。
    这就是说，我们两国之间的文化关系已经有了很大的发展，并在今后还要继续不断地发展。
    由于进行这些文化联系以及其他方面的需要，在中国知识分子中已经有了一个很大的学习俄文的高潮，而在苏联，学习中文的人数，也有了增加。这就将为两国人民在今后更加广泛的接触造成更有利的条件。
    我们两国之间，在“发展和巩固……经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作”的过程中，是完全按照条约所规定的精神和原则进行的，即“双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则”进行的。在这种精神与原则之下进行的彼此之间的经济援助与经济合作以及经济与文化关系的发展，也证实了毛泽东同志所说的，对于中苏两大国的繁荣以及对于全世界和平与正义的胜利，是有了巨大的影响的。
    以上这一切的事实都证明：经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的友谊和团结，三年来已经有了极大的发展，而且还要继续不断地发展下去。这种友谊和团结是永久的、牢不可破的、没有人能够分离的，在世界上是无敌的。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊和团结为什么能有这样的发展呢？为什么这种友谊和团结是永久的、牢不可破的、没有人能够分离的呢？
    因为我们两国之间的友谊和相互关系是与过去历史上资本主义国家之间的相互关系完全不同的。我们两国之间的关系是建立在两国人民的根本利益的基础之上的，是属于人民的两个国家之间的相互关系，是兄弟一般的互相帮助的关系，是斯大林和毛泽东的相互关系。在这种关系中，没有资本主义国家之间所必然有的那种尔虞我诈、互相竞争、互相排挤、互相勒索、或者一个压迫和掠夺另外一个的情形。我们两国之间的相互关系正如马林科夫同志所说的：“是各国之间的一种完全新的关系的范例，这种关系是历史上从来不曾有过的。这种关系的基础是平等、经济合作和尊重民族独立的原则。苏联信守它的互助条约，曾经给予而且今后将继续给予这些国家（即各人民民主国家）以援助和支持，使这些国家得到进一步的巩固和发展。”这种相互关系也正如斯大林同志在论到苏联与各人民民主国家的经济合作时所说的：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    正因为我们两国之间的相互关系是这样一种关系，所以我们两国人民之间的友谊和团结是永久的、牢不可破的、没有人能够分离的。
    在我们共产党人和劳动人民中间，先进者总是要更多地帮助落后者的。苏联在各人民民主国家中是居于显然的先进地位的，因此，就互相帮助这一点来说，苏联总是更多地帮助了我国及其他人民民主国家。我们对于苏联政府和苏联人民给我们国家和人民在各方面的忠诚无私的帮助，表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们！苏联是我们的模范，是我们的先生，苏联所走过的道路，就是我们现在和将来所要走的道路。我们今天在庆祝中苏友好同盟继续加强的时候，我们还必须提出向苏联学习的任务。
    从今年起，我国已经进入大规模的计划建设的时期。为了把我们国家的建设工作做好，我们必须努力向苏联学习，必须把虚心学习和运用苏联的先进经验看作是推进我们国家建设工作的首要条件之一。毛泽东同志说：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”为此，全国各机关、各团体、各工厂、各学校、各农村以及人民解放军的各部队，都应该遵照毛泽东同志的指示，认真地展开学习苏联的运动，来迎接我们伟大的国家建设工作。
    斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的发表，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的举行，给了中国人民在建设自己国家的工作中以不可估量的帮助。全中国的人民对于斯大林著作和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的学习，表现了极大的热情。大家从这些文件中正确地认识了当前世界的基本形势，认识了我们的事业为什么必然会胜利，以及要依靠什么方面，依靠什么力量，才能达到胜利。我们应当继续深入这种学习，并由此把全国人民对苏联的学习提高到一个新的阶段。
    在苏联的援助和苏联先进思想先进经验的照耀下，我们的建设事业是一定会得到胜利的。依靠中苏两大国人民的友好团结和亲密合作，我们是一定能够彻底打败帝国主义的侵略阴谋的。
    伟大的牢不可破的中苏友好同盟万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民最敬爱的朋友、全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志万岁！
