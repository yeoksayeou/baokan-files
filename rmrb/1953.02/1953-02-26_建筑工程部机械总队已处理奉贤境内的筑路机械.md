    The Construction Engineering Department Mechanical Corps Has Dealt With Road Building Machinery in Fengxian
    A letter from the Construction Engineering Department directly subordinate Engineering Mechanical Corps: The "Reader's Letters Column" published on October 25th last year carried a letter from Comrade Dong Guoping, a former reporter for the Southern Jiangsu Daily, suggesting that the large number of abandoned road building machinery in Fengxian be dealt with promptly. The twenty-two pieces of machinery stored in Shaqi Township, Fengxian, were transferred from the former China Construction Enterprise Corporation to our Corps' Road Building Machinery Repair Department (formerly under the Central Ministry of Communications) for receipt. Due to the insufficient load-bearing capacity of local highway bridges and the inability of the Minhang ferry to pass, there were many difficulties in transporting this batch of machinery. In November of last year, our Corps' Shanghai Repair Department disassembled and transported this batch of machinery in pieces to Shanghai for repair and disposal.

    建筑工程部机械总队已处理奉贤境内的筑路机械
    建筑工程部直属工程机械总队来信：去年十月二十五日“读者来信专页”刊载了原苏南日报记者董国平同志的来信，建议迅速处理奉贤境内弃置的大批筑路机械。存放奉贤砂碛乡的二十二部机械，是由前中国建筑企业总公司在去年移交我队筑路机械整修处（原属中央交通部）接收的。因当地公路桥梁载重量不够负荷，闵行轮渡亦无法通过，这批机械提运时困难较多。去年十一月，我队上海整修处已把这批机械拆卸分件装运到上海整修处理。
