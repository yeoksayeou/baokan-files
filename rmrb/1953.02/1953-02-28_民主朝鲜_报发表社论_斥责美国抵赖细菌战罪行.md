    "Democratic Korea" Newspaper Publishes Editorial
    Condemning US Denial of Germ Warfare Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 27th] The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on February 24th entitled "Facts Cannot Be Covered Up." The editorial pointed out: The confession of captured American Colonel Schwable once again conclusively proves the fact that the American aggressors systematically and on a large scale carried out germ warfare in Korea. Everyone knows that this heinous crime of the American aggressors has been repeatedly proven in the past. However, it has used all kinds of tricks and tried every means to cover it up. When the United Nations General Assembly's Seventh Session discussed including the issue of germ warfare on the agenda, it manipulated the voting machine to oppose inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of this issue in order to present sufficient evidence of American germ warfare, vainly attempting to suppress the angry protests of the people of the world. However, the facts cannot be covered up. The confession of captured American Schwable more clearly exposes the entire truth about the US germ warfare in Korea, as well as the US plot to further expand germ warfare in the future. The evidence is irrefutable. Is there still any room for the American imperialists to continue sophistry and shirk responsibility?
    The editorial concluded by emphasizing that the people of the world clearly know that if the murderers are not severely punished now, the disasters suffered by the Korean people today will fall on the heads of the people of the world tomorrow. Therefore, the people of the world unanimously angrily demand that the US imperialists be stopped from committing the crime of germ warfare and that the germ warfare criminals be severely punished.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表社论
    斥责美国抵赖细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】“民主朝鲜”报二月二十四日发表题为“事实是掩盖不了的”的社论。社论指出：美俘许威布尔上校的供词，再一次确凿地证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜有计划地大规模地肆行细菌战的事实。大家都知道，美国侵略者这种万恶的罪行过去已被多次证实。但是它却使用一切伎俩，千方百计地企图加以掩饰。在联合国第七届大会前半期会议讨论将细菌战问题列入议程时，它就曾操纵表决机器反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加这问题的讨论以提出关于美国进行细菌战的充分证据，妄想借此来抑制世界人民的愤怒抗议。但是，事实是掩盖不了的。美俘许威布尔的供词，更加清楚地揭穿了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的全部真相，以及美国企图在今后进一步扩大细菌战的阴谋。铁证如山，难道还有美帝国主义者继续诡辩、开脱罪责的余地吗？
    社论最后强调说：全世界人民都清楚地知道：如果现在不给杀人罪犯以沉重的打击，那么朝鲜人民今天遭受的灾难，明天就将落在世界人民的头上。因此，全世界人民一致愤怒地要求制止美帝国主义者进行细菌战的罪行。并要求严惩细菌战犯。
