Former Leading Cadres of the East China Construction Engineering Department
Serious Departmentalism Wastes a Large Number of Technical Personnel

[This newspaper dispatch] (The East China Construction Engineering Department, formerly the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, which was changed at the end of last December) leading cadres' departmentalism was serious, arbitrarily wasting a large number of technical personnel.

When the department was established in June last year, it gathered 934 technical personnel from various public construction units, including 234 engineers. Subsequently, the former East China Military and Political Committee successively transferred nearly 300 demobilized technical cadres to the department. The leading cadres of the department did not make a comprehensive and proper allocation and arrangement for this strong technical force, nor did they make the necessary investigations and adjustments. The leading cadres of certain departments within the ministry violated the principle of placing technical personnel in the most needed positions, and privately used their power and "friend" relationships to desperately pull familiar technical personnel to their side. The Construction Affairs Office of the department was a technical research and technical guidance department with no direct design and construction tasks, and did not need too many technical personnel at all. However, since the director and deputy director of the office, Wang Jiqi and Wu Shihhe, were originally the director and deputy manager of the Shanghai Construction Company, they pulled 45 technical personnel from the original Shanghai Construction Company and other units, including 28 engineers, and 10 of them were first- and second-level engineers.

After these departmentalists pulled in technical personnel, they did not have appropriate positions to place them and randomly put them in general administrative positions. In the Construction Affairs Office, two technicians were doing general statistical work, which was also being done by the department's Planning Office. Even technician Xin Yuanchu was doing report data work for deploying workers. Xin had repeatedly requested a job transfer, but the leading cadres criticized him for "ideological obstruction" and insisted that he "obey organizational assignment." In the Private Construction Industry Management Office, only one or two technical personnel occasionally encountered some technical review work, and the other ten or so technical personnel were not even clear about what work they were doing. Yao Shilian, the deputy director of the office, also frankly admitted: "We are doing odd jobs and crash tasks here; we are like both the government and the trade union." Tian Baolin and Yu Gangfu, engineers with more than 20 years of work experience, served as the heads of the registration section and the counseling section respectively in the office. They had not touched on technology at all for more than half a year. They had also repeatedly asked the leading cadres to transfer them to technical positions, but the leading cadres always advised them: "Since you are familiar with the people and things here, just keep doing it for now." More seriously, some units even kept the demobilized technical personnel in administrative positions. The Workshop Engineering Office of the department had four demobilized technical cadres doing recording work; a unit led by the department had 13 demobilized technical personnel doing purchasing, recording, storage, accounting, and other work. The leading cadres of these units said: "We are also very short of administrative cadres here, and these demobilized people are not very proficient in technology, so letting them do administrative work is both skilled and reassuring."

A widespread and serious situation is: on the surface, most of the technical personnel are placed in technical positions, but upon closer examination, many of them are still not using what they have learned. The department's Water and Electricity Installation Company has more than 20 civil engineering technicians doing general house water and electricity installation work. The leading cadres of the company also said: "We are also very short of water and electricity installation technicians, and civil engineering is related to house water and electricity installation work, so please help us for the time being." Many technical personnel in the department's Workshop Engineering Office are doing material supply, inspection, and statistical work. In the Construction Affairs Office of the department, five or six technical personnel are doing quota work. When they go to the construction site to measure workers' production, they also have to do recording work such as measuring tape and counting bricks. In fact, these tasks only require one or two technical personnel to lead non-technical personnel to do them.

These departmentalists desperately kept technical personnel by their side, but did not regularly conduct ideological education for them, nor did they care about their work. The Construction Affairs Office had not held an office meeting for several months. More than 40 technical personnel were not very clear about their responsibilities. The leaders of the office simply assigned tasks to them, saying: "We need to work on quotas, project inspection, and the promotion of advanced working methods." How to do it and to what extent, the leading cadres did not care about it. For example, three engineers and one technician in the office did project inspection work and wrote many inspection reports, raising some questions, but these reports were all stuffed into the director's drawer and did not have any effect at all. The technical personnel were generally uneasy, not knowing what to do. So during office hours, some read novels, some played chess, and some simply dozed off. The leaders of the office were busy in meetings all day long. The technical personnel repeatedly asked them to clearly define their tasks, but the leading cadres just perfunctorily said: "We are a little idle now, but we will be very busy in the future!" This serious situation has existed from October last year until now.

While these departmentalists were wasting a large number of technical personnel in this way, they also rejected all "upward transfers and downward requests." In August and September last year, the higher authorities twice wanted to transfer 14 and 6 civil engineering technicians from the department to support the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry of the central government. The leading cadres of the department initially delayed and ignored it, and then simply refused, saying: "The department is short of technical personnel and it is difficult to transfer them." The Third Engineering Office led by the department was short of technical personnel in September and October last year due to heavy tasks, and some projects could not start construction. The leading cadres of the Construction Affairs Office not only did not actively send technical personnel to support them, but even when the Third Engineering Office came to "borrow" three technical personnel, the office was only willing to "borrow" two, and after a week, they quickly called to urge them to return, because they were afraid that the technical personnel would be detained. Technician Zhang Xianzheng and others said well:
"Our leading cadres are full of a 'counting foreign money' mentality, holding a handful of foreign money, counting it every morning, saying: 'Good money! Good money!' But as a result, they don't use it or let it go, wasting a large amount of the country's wealth." This is a sharp criticism.

    前华东建筑工程部领导干部
    本位主义思想严重浪费大批技术人员
    【本报讯】前华东建筑工程部（去年十二月底已改为华东建筑工程局）领导干部本位主义思想严重，任意浪费了大批技术人员。
    去年六月间，该部成立时，即从各公营建筑单位集中了九百三十四名技术人员，其中有工程师二百三十四人。接着，前华东军政委员会又陆续抽调给该部近三百名归队的技术干部。该部领导干部对这一支强大的技术力量，并未作全面、妥善的分配和安排，也从未做过必要的调查和调整。部内某些处的领导干部更违反把技术人员放在最需要的岗位上的原则，私自运用职权和“朋友”关系，拼命把熟识的技术人员往自己的身边拉。该部营造事务处是一个技术研究和负责技术指导的部门，没有直接的设计和施工任务，根本不需要过多的技术人员，但由于该处正、副处长汪季琦、吴世鹤原是上海市建筑公司的正、副经理，他们便从原市建筑公司和其他单位拉去四十五名技术人员，其中有工程师二十八人，并有十名是一级和二级的工程师。
    这些本位主义者把技术人员拉去后，却没有适当的位置来安插，就随随便便把他们放在一般的行政事务岗位上。在营造事务处有两位技术员在做一般的统计工作，而这种工作该部计划处同时也在做；甚至如技师忻元初竟在做调配工人的报表资料工作。忻曾多次要求调动工作，领导干部却责备他“思想不通”，坚持要他“服从组织分配”。在私营营造业管理处仅有一、二位技术人员偶尔碰到一些技术审查工作，其他十余位技术人员究竟做些什么工作，连他们自己也说不清。该处姚世濂副处长也坦白承认说：“我们这里是既打杂、又突击；既像政府又像工会。”有二十余年工作经验的工程师田宝林和余纲复，分别在该处做登记科和辅导科的科长，半年多根本没有摸过技术的边，他们也曾多次要求领导干部调他们到技术岗位上去，但领导干部总是劝他们说：“熟人熟事的，还是暂时做下去吧。”更严重的是某些单位竟把归了队的技术人员依旧放在行政事务工作岗位上。该部工房工程处有四名归队的技术干部在做记录工作；该部领导的某单位，竟有十三名归队的技术人员在做采购、记录、保管、会计等工作。这些单位领导干部说：“我们这里行政干部也非常缺乏，这些归队的人技术又不大熟练了，让他们做行政工作是既熟练、又安心。”
     一种普遍严重的情况是：表面上大部分技术人员都放在技术岗位上了，但仔细研究一下，其中依旧有很多是学非所用。该部水电安装公司有二十余名土木技术人员在做一般的房屋水电安装工作，该公司领导干部还说：“水电安装技术人员也很缺乏，土木建筑又和房屋水电安装工作有联系，暂时还是请他们帮帮忙吧。”该部工房工程处有许多技术人员，在做材料供应、检验和统计工作。该部营造事务处中，有五六个技术人员在做定额工作。他们到工地测定工人生产时，还得做量皮尺、数砖头等记录工作。其实这些工作只要给一两位技术人员领导非技术人员做就可以了。
    这些本位主义者拼命把技术人员扣在身边，却不经常对他们进行思想教育，也很不关心他们的工作。营造事务处几个月没有开过一次处务会议，四十余名技术人员对自己的职责都不大明确，处的领导人员只对他们简单地布置任务说：“要搞定额、工程检查和推广先进工作法的工作。”究竟怎样搞，搞到什么程度，领导干部就不管了。如该处有三位工程师和一位技师做工程检查工作，也写了好多次检查报告，提出了一些问题，但这些报告都一股脑儿塞在处长的抽斗里，根本没有发生丝毫作用。技术人员普遍情绪不安，不知做些什么好，于是在办公时间内有的看小说，有的下象棋，有的干脆打起瞌睡。处的领导人员一天到晚开会忙，技术人员多次要求他们明确规定自己的任务，但领导干部只是敷衍地说：“暂时空闲一些，将来可要大忙哪！”如此严重的情况，竟从去年十月份一直存在到现在。
    本位主义者一面如此浪费大批技术人员，一面对“上调下要”又一概谢绝。去年八月和九月，上级曾两次要抽调该部十四名和六名土木技术人员去支援鞍山钢铁公司和中央第二机械工业部的基本建设，该部领导干部初则拖延不理，继则干脆回绝说：“本部技术人员缺乏，实难抽调。”该部领导的第三工程处在去年九、十月份，由于任务繁重，技术人员较缺，某些工程开不成工，营造事务处领导干部不仅不主动地派技术人员去支持，甚至当第三工程处来“商借”三位技术人员时，该处只肯“借”两个，而且到了一个星期后，又赶紧打电话去催回，因为怕技术人员被扣留下去。技术员张贤铮等说得好：
    “我们领导干部充满了一种‘数洋钱’的思想，捧着一大把洋钱，每天早上数一数，连称：‘好钱！好钱！’但结果用又不用，放又不放，白白糟蹋了国家大批财宝。”这真是一针见血的批评。
