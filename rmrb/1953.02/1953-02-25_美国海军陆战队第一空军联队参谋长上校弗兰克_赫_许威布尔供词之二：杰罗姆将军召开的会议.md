Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Testimony No. 2 of Colonel Frank H. Schwable, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing: The Meeting Convened by General Jerome.

    On May 25, 1952, Brigadier General Jerome, commander of the Marine Corps First Air Wing, convened a meeting of the First Wing's staff officers. This was the day after General Jerome was instructed by General Barcus, commander of the Fifth Air Force, to expand the bacteriological warfare being conducted by the Marine Corps First Air Wing to the operational stage.

    The meeting was held behind closed doors in the commander's office at Wing Headquarters. No records were kept, and no written materials were involved. The discussion was conducted in measured tones. In addition to General Jerome, those present were: Brigadier General LeMoyne A. Scrivner, Deputy Commander; myself, Chief of Staff; Colonel Sturch, Intelligence Officer; Colonel Winter, Operations Officer; and Colonel Clark, Logistics Officer.

    The meeting was extremely informal. As I have said, no records were kept, but what follows is a generally accurate account of what happened at that time, to the best of my recollection seven months later.

    General Jerome began by saying, "Yesterday I spoke with General Barcus for quite some time, and Colonel Matheson (Fifth Air Force Operations Officer) was also present. What I am about to tell you will shock you, just as it shocked me, but while we are still based on land in Korea, we must continue to carry out the orders of the Fifth Air Force."

    He then checked each person present to see if they were familiar with the current bacteriological warfare plan of bombing arbitrarily selected targets with "super propaganda" bombs. Everyone present either nodded or said, "Yes, sir." He continued, "You know that F7F (Tigercat) aircraft have been carrying out the super propaganda plan since the beginning of this year. This spring, our F2H (photo reconnaissance Banshee) aircraft joined the plan, and there are also some Air Force squadrons that I am not very familiar with that are also participating. This plan, up to now, has involved including all kinds of terrain by means of indiscriminate bombing."

    "Now there are instructions to make a drastic shift in these actions! General Barcus said that a contaminated zone should be established across central North Korea, with the Marine Corps First Air Wing responsible for the left flank, including Sinanju and Kunu-ri and the areas around and between these cities. The Air Force is responsible for the larger area in the center, from Kunu-ri to about thirty miles from the east coast, and the Navy is responsible for the right flank. Gentlemen, this means that in this kind of ill-fated war, we are moving into the operational stage!"

    The General paused, and no one spoke. He went on to describe the details, roughly as follows: "The part of this plan to be handled by the Marine Corps will initially be carried out by VMF-513—for them, this is just a shift of target, from scattered and sporadic bombing to bombing in a concentrated area. They are also responsible for maintaining the re-contamination of the area, with intervals not exceeding once every ten days.

    "VMF-513 will have to be responsible for maintaining such a schedule themselves. Specific missions will not be mentioned in the 'fragmentary' order ('fragmentary' orders are just fragments of the overall operational orders, but they contain detailed missions for individual operational units). In their reports on daily flight missions, VMF-513 will only need to report their usual night armed reconnaissance, and if special weapons are carried out during the mission, they will add the words 'via Sinanju' or 'via Kunu-ri'. VMF-513 should start this operation as soon as possible, and as they have already done, use all the usual equipment of K-8 (the air base in Kunsan), while cooperating with the Third Bombardment Group as needed. Only twin-engine F7F (Tigercat) aircraft will be used, and all previous safety precautions will continue to be in effect, such as flying over water as much as possible, only dropping super propaganda bombs at the same time as other bombs, and so on."

    General Jerome continued to say something like this: "This part of the plan does not create any special problems. It is a shift of target. As for the F2H (Banshee) aircraft, some planned infrequent missions will continue to be assigned in the 'fragmentary' order, as in the past.

    "The real problem, though not immediately pressing, is serious. These problems arise because this hitherto limited plan will now involve some groups, their air bases, and many people involved." A commotion clearly arose among all the officers present, because the news of the expansion of bacteriological warfare came like a bolt from the blue.

    General Jerome then outlined some further measures that would be necessary to implement the portion of the expanded bacteriological warfare plan assigned to the Wing. He said that the Marine Corps Air Group 12 must prepare to participate with a limited number of AD (Skyraider) and F4U (Corsair) aircraft, but that these aircraft would only be used to replace the F7F aircraft until further orders were received. As for Marine Corps Air Group 33, they will be used only as a last resort on a standby basis.

    "For the time being," General Jerome said, "we will continue to operate only at night, but daytime operations are not far off, and we may be ordered in the future to include 'super propaganda' bombs in daytime attacks. On this point, General Barcus explicitly said to me: 'If the government publicly announces the use of bacteriological warfare, then it will become part of all major attacks, and this will also be announced, with the aim of frightening workers from entering contaminated areas, thereby preventing workers from repairing the damage caused by bombing.' So you yourselves can see the possible extent of this operation and the preparations it requires."

    However, General Jerome continued, "I don't think we need to worry about such a large-scale operation for quite some time. What I have outlined to you is the main content of the new plan." Then he turned to Colonel Winter and said:

    "As I have already pointed out, the actions of VMF-513 will become routine. The squadron commander has the responsibility for implementation. The Fifth Air Force has, or will, directly notify him of this new plan, and tell him that this plan will not be mentioned on the 'fragmentary' order. However, I also want you to personally go and find that commander and tell him that I have been notified, and although I do not like this plan, it must be carried out according to instructions. Tell him that he has a special responsibility to ensure that the contaminated area must be maintained according to the ten-day cycle, and if he encounters difficulties or needs assistance, he can find the Wing."

    He also said to Colonel Winter: "I want you to talk to Galley and Condon as soon as possible, so that they will not be caught off guard once they receive the 'fragmentary' order mentioning 'super propaganda'." Colonels Galley and Condon were then the commanders of Marine Corps Air Groups 12 and 33, respectively.

    This was the main content of General Jerome's initial remarks about the new plan, followed by a period of free discussion.

    General LeMoyne A. Scrivner asked whether the plan to keep the area in a contaminated state would interfere with the very important normal night armed reconnaissance missions of the 513th Squadron. Colonel Winter said that he felt that this work would alleviate the problems of the 513th, because before this, the 513th had been carrying out bacteriological bombing missions throughout the southern half of North Korea, and had sometimes flown all the way to the east coast while trying to maintain patrols around the Haeju Peninsula. Now, he said, although more special bombs would be involved, all of the 513th's strength would be concentrated in the southwest of North Korea, and therefore more effective results should be produced.

    Colonel Winter estimated that after the 513th Squadron made the initial contamination, if five aircraft, each carrying two bacteriological bombs each night, it would only take about three or four nights out of every ten days to maintain the replenishment of bacteria in the area, and for the remaining nights, there would be no need to be troubled by super propaganda. And even on the nights when super propaganda was being carried out, the aircraft would only temporarily fly away from their main routes of responsibility.

    At this point, General Jerome interjected to emphasize that General Barcus had said that establishing a contaminated zone across Korea "will guarantee the success of the interdiction plan." The implication of this sentence is that bacteriological activity would not only not interfere with armed reconnaissance flights, it would also increase the effectiveness of the entire effort to disrupt supply lines.

    The words of General Barcus quoted above sparked a wide-ranging discussion among all those present about the use of bacteriological weapons in the interdiction plan. If my memory is correct, the discussion was started by me. I said that if the Air Force must resort to special weapons to make their interdiction plan effective, then the Air Force's situation must be very difficult indeed. I also frankly expressed my opinion that a determined enemy would not find it difficult to deal with a contaminated zone; that the tactical use of strategic weapons was a desecration; that the strategic use of uncontrollable bacteria and disease in a large-scale war against vast industrial areas was already a terrible thing; and that it would be even more cruel and unscrupulous to spread disease across the entire country in order to achieve the vague and unreliable hope of stopping highway transportation.

    Finally, I said that if we established an effective disease zone, I believed that the enemy would take all possible safety measures and still rush their supplies through that area at all costs, and as a result, the disease would very likely be brought to the front lines and spread to our own side, because infectious diseases are indiscriminate in who they infect.

    Colonel Winter went on to say that if the two super propaganda bombs on the wings of our night fighter planes were replaced with two large conventional bombs and could directly hit a bridge, it would have a far greater effect than the efforts of the entire squadron to spread disease across Korea.

    Colonel Clark pointed out that any concentrated use of super propaganda bombs in a certain area would only lead to the complete exposure of the myth that the United States was not using bacteriological warfare, and that we would thus make ourselves liars and lose more than we gained.

    Everyone started talking at the same time, trying to get a word in. Everyone pointed out that the Marine Corps Air Force was not organized, trained, and equipped to conduct bacteriological warfare, because bacteriological warfare was not part of amphibious landing operations; therefore, it did not seem right that we should be required to use bacteriological weapons in Korea simply because we were temporarily under the operational control of the Air Force. Finally, General Jerome spoke, saying that he really felt that the Air Force was extremely embarrassed about the interdiction plan.

    Several officers went on to say that if we had to use this kind of thing here, our government should admit it, because the enemy would soon find out through captured personnel. It was bad enough to experiment with bacteriological materials on the people and towns of Korea, and it was absurd to advance it from the experimental stage to the operational stage in a war of the scale of the Korean War, because bacteriological warfare is a strategic weapon specifically aimed at densely populated areas—which means mostly civilians—to stop wartime production. This was not applicable in Korea.

    It was about this time that General Jerome reminded us that we were not here to discuss the rights and wrongs of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea—this decision had already been made by "higher authorities"—we were here to discuss the plan itself and the necessary measures for the Wing to implement this plan.

    Colonel Clark then asked what the intention was for preparing the bomb supply and equipment for the AD (Skyraider) aircraft. General Jerome said that he had told General Barcus that he would do his best to avoid bombing on a large scale at K-6 base (the Marine Corps Air Group 12's base in Pyeongtaek), and that he hoped that General Barcus would remember that point when drafting the "fragmentary" order. He had also asked General Barcus to send a team of trained people from the Air Force to manage the bombs initially hung up from K-6 base. He said that Marine Corps Air Group 33 was very close to the basic bomb supply area in Ulsan, and if the group had to be used as a last resort, then he would not establish any bomb supply at their K-3 base (Pohang) that exceeded the number used by the F2H aircraft.

    Colonel Winter then said that if single Skyraider aircraft replaced Tigercat aircraft at night, they would have to fly to K-8 base (Kunsan) to listen to briefings anyway, so they could load bombs there. Even in daytime attacks with a small number of aircraft, there would be no difficulty in sending them to K-8 base to pick up special bombs and then meet with other aircraft on the way to the target.

    General Jerome said that a very small number of staff members in Marine Corps Air Group 12 should know that Skyraider aircraft might participate in the plan, and that a few specially qualified, carefully selected, reliable and loyal pilots should be informed of this matter so that they would not be confused when they were immediately called to participate. As for Marine Corps Air Group 33, he would leave it entirely to Colonel Condon to decide who to tell, but that number must be very small, and a list of specially qualified pilots must be kept at all times.

    Colonel Winter asked which people on our own staff should know, and specifically mentioned the medical officer. I strongly opposed letting the medical officer know, on the grounds that he had no "need to know" in order for the plan to proceed properly. I suggested that no one not present that day should be informed without my and the commander's special and individual approval, but that the operations officer and the logistics officer (but not the intelligence officer) should have the right to inform a very few officers, who are necessary to effectively perform their tasks in their departments, and that these officers must be majors and above, and if possible, must be regular rather than reserve, and officers who still have several days to serve in Korea.

    This raised the general issue of secrecy, which we all recognized as one of the main problems.

    General Jerome said: "Tell everyone involved, from top to bottom, including Barcus, and now including me, that everyone says that this is national policy, not just military secrecy." He reported that General Barcus had said that there should be nothing in writing about this plan, and that the terms "bacteriological warfare" or similar should be prohibited, except initially to identify it with this plan.

    The discussion about secrecy was long and detailed. At the end of the discussion, General Jerome said that secrecy was "everyone's business," that everyone had to be responsible, and that everyone had to play a role—this was a chain with many links, and one broken link could destroy the chain. One officer pointed out that the Chinese had already claimed that the United States was using bacteriological warfare, and that since the B-29 aircraft had previously conducted bacteriological warfare, many pilots had become prisoners of war, and therefore, by now the enemy must already know that bacteriological warfare had been used.

    We all recognized this truth, but as the General pointed out, if the government decided to deny the use, then we soldiers had no choice but to do our best to maintain this fabrication. He said that since 300 to 400 people in the Wing were rotating back to the United States every month, it was only a matter of time before the truth came out, and that for the time being, every effort had to be made to make this fabricated story about propaganda seem as true as possible.

    It was generally agreed that secrecy in this matter, as in normal circumstances, was more important to avoid letting our own people know than to conceal the facts from the enemy.

    General Jerome concluded the meeting after summarizing his instructions. To the best of my recollection, that summary was like this:

    He said to Colonel Winter: "You will visit VMF-513 tomorrow and tell them that Barcus has included me as well, and that they should implement the plan as soon as possible. Emphasize secrecy, but above all, emphasize the necessity of maintaining the ten-day contamination cycle, because this responsibility is being given directly to them. After that, find Galley and Condon as quickly as possible so that they can start thinking about the issues. Make Galley keenly aware of the fact that I think his part will be a small-scale operation for quite some time." He said to Colonel Clark: "You and Galley check to see what assistance he needs when he starts setting up a small supply of bombs." His last few words were to Colonel Sturch: "Keep your ears and eyes wide open, secrecy is essential." Frank H.

    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之二：杰罗姆将军召开的会议
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之二：杰罗姆将军召开的会议。
    一九五二年五月二十五日，海军陆战队第一空军联队司令，杰罗姆准将召集了第一联队参谋部官员，举行了一次会议。这是在第五航空队司令巴克斯将军指示杰罗姆将军把海军陆战队第一空军联队所进行的细菌战扩大到作战阶段的次一日举行的。
    这次会议是在联队总部司令办公室内，关起门来举行的。没有作记录，也没有牵涉到书面的材料。讨论是以有节制的声调进行的。出席的人，除杰罗姆将军之外，有：莱姆逊—斯克里布纳准将，副司令；我本人，参谋长；斯特奇上校，情报官员；温特上校，作战官员；克拉克上校，后勤官员。
    会议是极其非正式的。正如我已说过，并没有作记录，但是以下所述是七个月后按我记忆所及对当时发生的事情一个大体上正确的报告。
    杰罗姆将军开始时说：“昨天我和巴克斯将军谈了相当的时候，另外只有麦逊上校（第五航空队作战官员）在场。我要告诉你们的，将使你们震惊，正如它使我吃惊一样，但是在我们还以朝鲜陆地为基地时，我们必须继续执行第五航空队的命令。”
    他于是检查了一下在场的每一人，对于当前用“超级宣传”弹轰炸任意选择的目标的细菌战计划，是否熟悉。所有在座的人不是点头就是说：“是的，长官。”他继续说：“你们知道，F7F型（虎猫式）飞机自今年年初就执行了超级宣传计划，今春，我们的F2H型（照相侦察的女妖式）飞机参加了计划，此外还有某些我不大熟悉的空军中队也参加了。这个计划到现在为止，是在用随意轰炸的办法来包括所有各种地形。”
    “现在已经有指示使这些行动来一个激烈的转变！巴克斯将军说，要横贯北朝鲜中部建立一个沾染地带，由海军陆战队第一空军联队负责左翼，包括新安州及军隅里以及这些城市周围和之间的地区。空军负责中部较大的地区，自军隅里到距离东海岸约三十英里的地方，而海军负责右翼。先生们，这就是说，在这样一种倒霉的战争中，我们正在转入作战行动的阶段！”
    将军停了一下，没有一个人作声。他继续描述细节，大致如下：“在这个计划中由海军陆战队负责的一部分，最初由VMF513进行——对他们来说，这只是转移一下目标，从散漫零星的轰炸转为在一个集中地区轰炸。他们还有责任保持把该地区重新加以沾染，其间隔期间不得超过每十天一次。
    “VMF513将须自己负责维持这样一个周期表，在‘分’令中将不提及具体的任务（‘分’令只是全部作战命令中的片断，但是其中包含个别作战单位的详细任务）。VMF513在关于日常飞行任务的报告中，只需报告他们通常的夜间武装侦察，如在执行任务中携带了特殊武器，就附加‘途经新安州’或‘途经军隅里’字样。VMF513要尽早开始这种行动，并像他们所已经作的一样，利用K—8（在群山的空军基地）的一切通常的设备，同时视需要与第三轰炸机联队配合。只有双引擎的F7F型（虎猫式）飞机将被使用，而以前关于安全的所有预防措施将继续有效，例如，尽可能飞经水面，只能与其他炸弹同时投下超级宣传弹，等等。”
    杰罗姆将军又继续说大致如下的话：“计划的这一部分不产生什么特殊问题。它是转移了一下目标。对于F2H型（女妖式）飞机，将和过去一样，继续在‘分’令中指派一些计划中的不经常的任务。
    “真正的问题，虽然不是迫在目前，但却是严重的，这些问题之产生是因为这个迄今为止有限的计划现在将牵进来一些大队、它们的空军基地以及许多被涉及的人员。”在到会的所有军官中显然起了一个骚动，因为这个意味着扩大细菌战的消息来得像一个晴天霹雳。
    杰罗姆将军接着概括地指出了一些进一步的措施，这些措施是为实行扩大细菌战计划中指派给联队的那部分任务时所必需的。他说，海军陆战队空军第十二大队必须准备以数目有限的AD型机（空中侵略者式）和F4U型机（海盗式）去参加，不过，在得到别的命令之前，这些飞机将只是用来替代F7F型机。至于海军陆战队第三十三空军大队，它们将在待命的基础上，只在紧急情况中万不得已时方予使用。
    “在目前，”杰罗姆将军说，“我们将继续仅在夜间活动，但日间的行动已为时不远，我们可能在将来受到命令把‘超级宣传’弹包括在日间的袭击中。关于这一点，巴克斯将军曾明确地向我说：‘如果政府公开宣布使用细菌战，那么它将成为所有主要袭击的一部分，同时也将如此宣布，目的在使工人害怕进入沾染地区从而阻止工人修复轰炸所致的损毁。’所以你们自己就能看出这种行动及其所需要的准备工作的可能的广阔程度。”
    不过，杰罗姆将军继续说，“我想在一个相当长的时期以内我们还不必为这样大规模的行动担心，我所已经概括告诉你们的便是新计划的主要内容。”然后他转向温特上校说：
     “正如我所已经指出的，VMF513的行动将成为经常性的，中队指挥官掌有执行的责任，第五航空队已经，或将要，把这个新计划直接通知他，并告诉他‘分’令上将不会提及这个计划。不过，我还要你亲自去找一找那位指挥官，告诉他我已接到通知，虽然我并不喜欢这个计划，但是必须要按照指示执行。告诉他，他有特别的责任来保证沾染区必须按照十天的周期予以维持，如果他遇到困难或需要援助，可以找联队。”
    他还对温特上校说：“我要你尽早与盖洛和康登谈话，以便他们一旦接到‘分’令提到‘超级宣传’时，他们不致措手不及。”盖洛和康登两个上校那时分别是海军陆战队第十二和三十三空军大队的指挥官。
    这便是杰罗姆将军在谈到新计划时开头一些话的主要内容，接着便是一阵自由讨论。
    莱姆逊—斯克里布纳将军询问保持这区域在沾染状态中的计划会不会妨碍非常重要的第五一三中队通常的夜间武装侦察任务。温特上校说，他觉得这工作将减轻五一三的问题，因为在此以前，五一三一直在北朝鲜的南半部各地执行细菌轰炸的任务，有时在尽力保持海州半岛一带的巡逻同时，还一直飞到东海岸。现在，他说，虽然将牵涉到更多的特别炸弹，五一三所有的力量将集中在北朝鲜的西南部，因此便应该产生更为有效的结果。
    温特上校估计，在五一三中队作初步的沾染后，如果五架飞机每架每晚携带两枚细菌弹，那么每十天中，大约只须三夜或四夜便可对这区域维持补充细菌，而在其余的几夜里就不必再受超级宣传的麻烦。并且即使在作超级宣传的夜里，飞机也只是暂时地飞离它们负责的主要路线。
    在这时，杰罗姆将军插进来强调巴克斯将军曾说，横跨朝鲜建立一个沾染地带“将保证阻击计划的成功。”这句话的含义是细菌活动不但不会妨碍武装侦察飞行，它并将为中断供应线的全部努力增加效力。
    上面所引述的巴克斯将军的话，引起了所有在座的人关于在阻击计划中使用细菌武器的广泛讨论。如果我的记忆是正确的话，讨论是由我开始的。我说，如果空军必须乞灵于特别武器来使它们的阻击计划生效，那么，无论如何，空军的情况一定是很困难的了。我还坦白地表示我的意见，即：一个有决心的敌人，对于沾染地带是不难应付的；把战略性的武器作战术性的使用，是一种污渎；把无法控制的细菌和疾病在一场大规模的战争中战略地用来对付巨大的工业区，已经是一件可怕的事；若为了要达到把公路运输终止这样一个渺茫而不可靠的希望，把疾病撒布到横跨整个国家的地区中去，那就更加残忍而肆无忌惮了。
    最后我说，如果我们建立了一个有效的疾病区，我相信敌人将采取各种他们可能有的安全措施，不顾一切地仍把他们的给养冲过那地区，结果很可能把疾病带到前线，并传布到我们自己这一边来，因为传染病在感染谁这一点上是不认人的。
    温特上校接着说，如果将我们的夜间战斗机机翼上的两枚超级宣传弹用两枚大的普通炸弹来替代，并能直接击中一座桥梁的话，那将比整个中队在朝鲜散布疾病的努力，收到远为巨大的功效。
    克拉克上校指出任何在某一地区集中使用超级宣传弹的事实将只会引致完全暴露美国并未运用细菌战的神话，这样我们将使自己成为撒谎者，并因而得不偿失。
    每人都同时开始抢着讲话。大家指出：海军陆战队的空军并非为进行细菌战而组织、训练和装备起来的，因为细菌战并不是两栖登陆作战的一部分；因此，若因为我们暂时在作战上受空军的控制，便要求我们在朝鲜使用细菌武器，似乎并不是一件正确的事情。最后杰罗姆将军发言，他说他真正感觉的空军方面在阻击计划一事上已窘迫万分。
    好几个军官接着说，如果我们必须在这里使用这种东西，我们的政府应该承认这件事，因为通过被俘人员，敌人很快便会发现的。把朝鲜的人民和市镇来试验细菌物品已经足够恶劣，而在朝鲜战争这样一个规模的战争中把它从实验的阶段推进到作战行动的阶段，实在是荒唐的，因为细菌战是一种战略武器，专门以密集的人口为目标——这便意味着大部分是平民——以停止战时生产。这一点在朝鲜是不适用的。
    大约是在这时候，杰罗姆将军提醒我们：我们不是到这里来讨论在朝鲜进行细菌战一事的是非的——这决定早已由“上级”作出来了——我们是来讨论计划本身以及联队实行这计划时的必要措施的。
    克拉克上校于是发问，为AD型机（空中侵略者式）准备炸弹供应和设备的意图何在。杰罗姆将军说，他曾告诉巴克斯将军他将尽力之所及避免在K—6基地（海军陆战队第十二空军大队在平泽的基地）大规模上炸弹，并希望在拟订“分”令时巴克斯将军将记住那一点。他还曾要求巴克斯将军从空军中派一队有训练的人来管理开始初期从K—6基地挂用的炸弹。他说，海军陆战队第三十三空军大队离在蔚山的基本炸弹供应区很近，如果该大队在不得已时方予使用，那么他便不在它们的K—3基地（浦项）建立任何超过F2H型机（女妖式）使用数量以上的任何炸弹供应。
    温特上校接着说，如果单架的空中侵略者式机在夜间替代虎猫式机，它们无论如何将必须飞赴K—8基地（群山）去听取简令，因此它们可以在那边上炸弹。即使在进行少量飞机的白天袭击中，把它们送到K—8基地去取特别炸弹然后在赴目标的途中和其他飞机会合一事，也不会有什么困难的。
    杰罗姆将军说，海军陆战队第十二空军大队中非常小的一个数目的参谋人员应当知道空中侵略者式飞机可能参预计划，并使少数几个特别合格的、精选过的、可靠并忠心的驾驶员得知此事，以便他们能在立刻被召参加时不致迷惑混乱。至于海军陆战队第三十三空军大队，他将完全交由康登上校去决定究竟告诉那些人，不过那数目必须很小，并且必须经常保持一张特别合格的驾驶员的名单。
    温特上校问及我们自己的工作人员中有那些人应当知道，并特别提到了医务官。我竭力反对让医务官知道，反对的根据是，为使计划适当进行，他并没有“知道的必要”。我建议，没有我和司令官的特别的和个别的批准，便不得让那天不在场的人知道，不过作战官员和后勤官员（但是情报官员除外）应有权告知一些为要在他们的部门中有效执行任务所必需的极少数的军官，并且这些军官必须是少校和少校以上，可能的话，必须是正规的而不是后备的，以及在朝鲜还须服役若干时日的军官。
    这就提出了一般的保密事项，我们都承认这是主要问题中的一个。
    杰罗姆将军说：“告诉所有有关的人，自上而下，包括巴克斯而现在也包括我，每人都说这是国家政策，不仅是军事保密。”他报告说，巴克斯将军曾说，关于这个计划不得有书面的东西，禁止使用“细菌战”或类似的名词，除非是最初为了与这个计划识别起见。
    关于保密的讨论是长而详尽的，讨论结束时，杰罗姆将军说，保密是“所有人的事”，每人都要负责，每人都要起作用——这是一条有许多环节的链子，断了一环就能毁坏这条链子。某一个军官指出，中国人已经声称美国使用细菌战，而自从B—29型飞机早先进行了细菌战以来，许多驾驶员已成为战俘，因此，到现在敌人一定已经知道使用了细菌战。
    我们都认识到这个真理，但是正如将军所指出，假如政府决定否认使用，那么我们军人没有别的办法，只有尽力维持这个杜撰的说法。他说，联队中每月既有三百至四百人轮换回美国，那么这个真相之大白，仅是时间问题，而目前要尽一切努力来使这个关于宣传的杜撰说法尽可能地显得像是真的。
    一般都同意，在这件事上的保密，正和通常情况一样，更重要的是避免使我们自己的人知道，而不是对敌人隐蔽事实。
    杰罗姆将军在总结了他的指示后结束了那次会议。据我记忆所及，那总结是这样的：
    他向温特上校说：“你要在明天去访问VMF513，并告诉他们，巴克斯已把我也算上一份，要他们尽早实行计划。强调保密，但是，超越一切的是强调维持十天沾染周期的必要，因为这一责任正在直接交给他们。此后，便尽可能快地去找盖洛和康登，以便他们可以开始考虑问题。让盖洛深刻明了这一事实，那就是，我想他的那部分将在相当时期内是一个小规模的行动。”他向克拉克上校说：“你和盖洛查对一下，看看他在搞起一个小小的供应炸弹的设备时，需要什么帮助。”他最后的几个字是对斯特奇上校说的：“把你的耳朵和眼睛张得大大的，保密是至关紧要的。”弗兰克·赫·许威布尔（签名）（军号）04429美国海军陆战队上校一九五二年十二月十九日北朝鲜（附图片）
