    Fighting Difficulties, Racing Against Time
    – Introduction to the Piling Project of the Steel Casting Workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory

    Walking into the gate of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, one sees to the northwest of the office building a steel structure roof truss decorated with red paint, as tall as an ordinary five-story building. This is the steel casting workshop under construction.
    The steel casting workshop is one of the most difficult projects in the construction of the Heavy Machinery Factory. In terms of area, this workshop is more than 12,000 square meters, larger than the already built primary processing workshop and cold working workshop; in terms of structure, they are all steel structure roof trusses. However, the most arduous project of this workshop is to drive 865 concrete piles (the general pile length is 9 meters, the longest reaches 14 meters). All workshops are built on the same soil, but only the steel casting workshop needs to be piled, because its equipment is particularly complex. This workshop is to cast castings weighing 35 tons, and casting such large castings requires 50 tons of molten steel. To supply 50 tons of molten steel at one time, two open-hearth furnaces and two electric furnaces must be installed in the workshop. Four furnaces simultaneously serve one casting, which requires double-layer cranes on the roof truss to transport the molten steel from the four furnaces to the mold in a very short time. The cranes vary in size, the largest reaching 75 tons and the smallest only a few tons. Therefore, the load-bearing capacity of the house pillars also varies, the largest reaching 700 tons and the smallest only a few dozen tons. The workshop is so large, and the load-bearing capacity of the pillars is so disparate, that if the foundation is not piled, the entire building will sink unevenly.
    Piles must be driven, the question is what kind of piles are cost-effective. Driving wooden piles is the easiest, but China currently lacks wood, where can we find more than 800 straight wooden piles with a diameter of 300 mm and a length of 19 meters? Driving precast reinforced concrete piles is also relatively simple, but it would add two months of prefabrication time. And time is precious. The factory, originally planned to be built in five years, now needs to be completed in four years. The technical design and construction drawings of this workshop were only completed in August last year. If we spend time ordering precast reinforced concrete piles, we will waste the good construction season, which will affect this year's engineering plan and extend the factory construction plan by one year. In 1954, many of our factories and mines need to be equipped from here, and a one-year extension would be a great loss to the country.
    Now only the method of "cast-in-place concrete piles" (note) remains. Driving this kind of pile is cheaper than driving wooden piles and precast reinforced concrete piles, but it is particularly difficult and troublesome. Before liberation, only the Danish Kangyi Foreign Company in Shanghai had done this kind of pile driving. For the Heavy Machinery Factory, not only the workers had no experience, the designers had never seen it, but there were also no pile driving machines, frames, and other equipment. No experience, no equipment, and short time, these are all the difficulties. Fighting against difficulties and racing against time is the task of the people building the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory.
    Relying on the wisdom of workers and technicians can overcome any difficulty. An engineer who had driven this kind of pile in the Danish Kangyi Foreign Company was building the Peace Hotel in Beijing last August, and he introduced the method of pile driving. Engineers designed pile driving frames based on materials from Soviet books, and workers in the cold working workshop made them according to the drawings. The pile pipes were made by workers using nine-millimeter-thick iron plates. In order to prevent them from breaking, steel rings and steel bars were added to the outside of the pipes. The workers also made pile tips, pile caps, and pulleys. The factory construction preparation office also borrowed two winches from the Railway Corps to replace pile drivers.
    The difficulty of no equipment has been initially overcome. They planned to operate two winches simultaneously, driving two small piles a day. However, one winch could not be used at all, and the efficiency of the other winch was not as fast as planned. After driving for more than twenty days, at first only one pile could be driven a day, and later at most only six piles could be driven a day.
    The speed was too slow, and there was not enough time. We must find another way. Therefore, the leading cadres of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory convened "Zhuge Liang Meetings" for workers and technicians, mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas. At the meeting, technician Zhou Yongqiao suggested using a five-ton crane to hammer the piles and a twenty-five-ton crane to pull out the pile pipes (every time two meters deep of concrete slurry is poured, the pile hammer must be used to impact it once, and then the pile pipe is pulled out two meters, and then concrete slurry is poured). The test results proved that this suggestion was very good. It was estimated that three shifts working in rotation could drive twenty-four piles a day. The workers were in high spirits, but the leading cadres breathed a sigh of relief. The pile driving project was the task of the engineering team, and the crane was allocated by the supply section of the preparation office. The supply section lacked an overall concept, and most of the drivers sent were unskilled. The leading cadres were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and wisdom of the workers, and did not check the quality of the workers transferred from the supply section in advance, nor did they organize the workers to discuss the operating procedures afterward. As a result, although the workers of other types of work were as anxious as ants on a hot pot, the crane was never driven fast. Especially at night, the crane often overturned due to incorrect operation by the workers. Only eight piles were driven in twenty-four hours, and the highest efficiency was only ten piles.
    This failure made the leading cadres realize that they must strengthen their leadership over the workers and make the workers consciously and strictly implement the operating procedures. The leading cadres then convened meetings of workers and technicians to study and formulate unified operating procedures; at the same time, they changed the three shifts to two shifts and transferred skilled drivers to replace unskilled workers. The leadership was strengthened, and the workers consciously complied with the operating procedures they had formulated. As a result, there were no accidents, and the efficiency was greatly improved. Sixteen piles could be driven a day, and with the piles driven by the winch, twenty-two piles could be driven a day. In this way, the arduous and troublesome pile driving project was completed three days ahead of schedule. Because the workers making steel structure roof trusses followed closely behind, most of the steel frame project has now been fitted with arched top frames. It will be completed this spring when the brick walls are built.
    [Note] "Cast-in-place concrete pile" means first driving a steel pipe into the ground, then injecting concrete into the steel pipe in batches, applying impact, and simultaneously pulling the steel pipe out of the ground in batches. When the steel pipe is pulled out, a concrete pile remains in the ground.

    与困难斗争，和时间竞赛
    ——太原重型机器厂铸钢车间打桩工程介绍
    超祺
    走进太原重型机器厂的大门，便看到在办公大楼的西北方，矗立着一座饰着红漆的有普通五层楼房那么高的钢结构屋架。这是正在建设的铸钢车间。
    铸钢车间是重型机器厂建设过程中最困难的一个工程。论面积，这个车间有一万二千多平方公尺，比已经建设起来的初加工车间、冷作车间大一些；论结构，都是钢结构屋架。但是这个车间最艰巨的工程是要打八百六十五根混凝土桩（一般的桩长九公尺，最长的达十四公尺）。各个车间都是建筑在同样的土壤上，唯有铸钢车间要打桩，是因为它的设备特别复杂。这个车间要铸三十五吨重的铸件，而铸这样大的铸件需要五十吨钢水。一次供给五十吨钢水，就得在车间里装置两个平炉和两个电炉。四个炉子同时为一个铸件服务，就必须在屋架上有双层行车，这才能在很短的时间内把钢水从四个炉子里运到铸模里去。行车有大有小，最大的达七十五吨，最小的只有几吨。因而房屋柱子的载重量也就有大有小，最大的达七百吨，最小的只有几十吨。车间这样大，柱子的载重量又这样悬殊，如果地基不打桩，整个房子将会不均匀地下沉。
    桩是非打不可的，问题是打什么桩才合算。打木桩最省事，但我国木材目前很缺乏，那里去找八百多根直径三百公厘、长十九公尺而又笔直的木桩呢？打预制钢筋混凝土桩也比较简单，但得增加两个月的预制时间。而时间是宝贵的。本来计划五年建成的工厂，现在要提前在四年内完成。这个车间的技术设计和施工图，去年八月份才完成。如果再花时间去订购预制钢筋混凝土桩，就白白地放过大好的施工季节，就要影响到今年的工程计划，就会把建厂计划延长一年。一九五四年我们的许多工厂矿山需要从这里得到装备，延长一年对国家的损失太大了。
    现在只剩下“就地浇注混凝土桩”（注）一个办法了。打这种桩比打木桩和预制钢筋混凝土桩都便宜，但却特别困难和麻烦。这种桩，在解放以前只有上海的丹麦康益洋行做过，对于重型机器厂来说，不独工人没有经验，设计人员没有见过，也没有打桩机械、架子和其他设备。没有经验，没有设备，时间又短，这就是全部的困难。与困难斗争，与时间竞赛，这便是建设太原重型机器厂的人们的任务。
    依靠工人和技术人员的智慧可以克服任何困难。曾经在丹麦康益洋行打过这种桩的一位工程师去年八月正在北京建设和平宾馆，他介绍了打桩的方法。工程师们根据苏联书籍上的材料，设计了打桩架子，冷作车间工人就照图样来制造。桩管子是工人用九公厘厚的铁板做的，为了使它不至折断，又在管子外边加上钢圈和钢条。工人们还制造了桩尖、桩帽和滑车。建厂筹备处又从铁道兵团借来两部卷扬机代替打桩机。
    没有设备的困难初步克服了。他们计划用两部卷扬机同时操作，每天可以打二小根桩。但是有一部卷扬机根本不能使用，另一部卷扬机的效率也不如计划要求的那样快。一连打了二十多天，起初每天只能打一根桩，以后最多每天也只能打六根。
    速度太慢，时间来不及了。必须得另想法子。于是，太原重型机器厂的领导干部便召集工人和技术人员开“诸葛亮会”，发动大家想办法。会上，技术员周永乔建议用五吨起重机来打桩锤，用二十五吨起重机来拔桩管（每灌两公尺深的混凝土浆，必须用桩锤冲一次，然后把桩管拔出两公尺，再灌混凝土浆）。试验结果，证明这个建议很好，估计三班轮流操作，每天可以打二十四根桩。工人的情绪很高，但领导干部却松了气。打桩工程是工程队的任务，起重机是筹备处供应科拨给的。供应科缺乏整体观念，派来的驾驶员大部分都是技术不熟练的。领导干部被职工的热情和智慧冲昏了头脑，事先不检查供应科调来的工人质量，事后也没有组织工人讨论操作规程。结果尽管别的工种的工人急得如热锅上的蚂蚁，但是起重机开得总不快，特别是在夜晚，常常由于工人操纵错误，起重机都开翻了。二十四小时只打八根桩，效率最高的也不过打十根。
    这次失败，使领导干部认识到必须加强对工人的领导，使工人自觉地严格地执行操作规程。领导干部便又召集工人、技术人员开会，研究、订出了统一的操作规程；同时把三班改为两班，把驾驶技术熟练的工人调进去代替不熟练的工人。领导加强了，工人又自觉地遵守自己订的操作规程，于是事故没有了，效率大大提高了，每天可以打十六根桩，加上用卷扬机打的，每天就可以打二十二根桩。这样就提前三天完成了艰巨、麻烦的打桩工程。由于作钢结构屋架的工人紧跟着追上来，现在绝大部分的钢架工程已装上弓形的顶架。今春砌上砖墙就完工了。
    〔注〕“就地浇注混凝土桩”，就是先把钢管打入地下，再将混凝土分次注入钢管，加以撞压，同时分次把钢管从地下拔出，把钢管拔出来，一支混凝土桩就留在地下。
