    Shandong Province, Cangshan County Magistrate Zhang Zuochen Severely Punished for Forcing the Masses to Destroy Cotton Fields
    Editor's Note: The fact that Zhang Zuochen, the magistrate of Cangshan County, Shandong Province, and a member of the Cangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, forced the masses to uproot over 400 mu of cotton fields in order to promote Si Zi cotton, demonstrates the extreme severity of the commandist style of individual responsible cadres in some counties. Their arbitrary actions that harm the interests of the people cannot be tolerated. This fact also shows that the commandist errors of some cadres are inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leading organs. The Cangshan County Committee had been supporting Zhang Zuochen's erroneous actions, and even proposed the extremely erroneous measure of "compensating the losses of small cotton farmers by large cotton farmers." The Linyi Prefectural Committee also focuses more on making arrangements and less on inspection and summarization, is overwhelmed with routine matters, and does not understand the situation below, which led to the error in Cangshan County of repeatedly forcing the masses to "clear cotton fields" and destroy cotton. This should be brought to the deep attention of Party committees in various places.
    The actions of Zhang Zuochen, the magistrate of Cangshan County, Shandong Province, and a member of the Cangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, etc., in forcing the peasant masses to destroy cotton fields, seriously infringing upon the interests of the peasant masses, and undermining the Party's production policies, cannot be tolerated. The Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Government have given Zhang Zuochen, etc., punishments accordingly.
    When Cangshan County began to promote the planting of Wu Ai Si Zi cotton (locally known as Da Mian or Big Cotton) the year before last, some farmers planted a portion, but due to insufficient mobilization and education and a lack of technical guidance, most of them suffered poor harvests, except for a few farmers who benefited well. Therefore, when they were called upon to plant Wu Ai Si Zi cotton again last year, many farmers did not agree with the idea and were unwilling to plant it. The reasons were: on the one hand, they were afraid of poor harvests due to poor planting; on the other hand, they were afraid that the cooperatives would not purchase it, and if they sold it on the market, the price would be lower than that of ordinary cotton (locally known as Xiao Mian or Small Cotton). When cotton was planted last spring, the leading cadres of Cangshan County did not deeply understand the ideological concerns of the peasant masses, and did not mobilize and educate them well, but forcibly required the peasant masses to plant Si Zi cotton uniformly. At that time, they also told the farmers: "It is not allowed to plant small cotton. If you plant small cotton, you will have to pull it out in the future." Under these circumstances, many farmers adopted a perfunctory attitude. Some threw away the Si Zi cotton seeds that they were forced to buy and still planted small cotton; some interplanted or mixed large and small cotton; and some planted a little Si Zi cotton at the edge of the field, while still planting small cotton inside the field. After discovering this situation, Zhang Zuochen, the magistrate of Cangshan County, not only did not raise his alert and promptly check and correct his bureaucratic errors, but also erroneously arranged for "clearing cotton fields" at district and township cadre meetings five times after the cotton seedlings had grown, and also erroneously put forward the slogan "Forced early is better than forced late." After the meeting, many cotton-growing districts carried out "clearing." On June 20th last year, when the cotton was already blooming and bearing peaches, Zhang Zuochen still emphasized at a district cadre meeting: "The task of clearing cotton fields must be resolutely implemented in all districts."
    Under Zhang Zuochen's erroneous arrangements, some district leading cadres forced farmers to uproot small cotton, seriously infringing on the interests of the masses. At that time, township and village cadres and farmers repeatedly went to the district to request that they not pull out small cotton. Some district cadres did not consider the voices and demands of the peasant masses, but instead ordered township cadres to lead militiamen and organize Communist Youth League members and primary school students to check everywhere with sickles and pull cotton everywhere, and even ordered cotton farmers in each village to pull each other's cotton. Fu Zhongfa, the head of the Fourteenth District, also criticized Wang Xingkui, the secretary of the Wutan Township Branch, Zhao Jingxiang, the township head, and Liu Xianbin, the secretary of the Edan Village Branch, for reflecting the opinions of the peasant masses to the district three times as "following the tail of the masses." Finally, under the criticism of the district head, Wang Xingkui and others had to organize militiamen to force farmers to pull cotton, and District Head Fu Zhongfa personally went to the cotton fields to supervise. When some of the masses saw their cotton being cut down, they lay on the ground crying and scolding. Fu Zhongfa also said: "You scold me here, and when I leave, you can scold the cotton!" Township cadres in Bianjiazhuang Township, Tenth District, also went to the district several times to reflect the demands of the peasant masses, and proposed: "There is too much small cotton planted this year, it would be a pity to cut it down!" District Head Zhou Shengxiang said: "Even if only ten mu are left out of a hundred mu, they must be cut down." Zhu Qingxiang, the secretary of the Bianjiazhuang Township Branch of the Communist Party, said to Zhou Shengxiang: "Most of our village is planted with small cotton. If the small cotton is pulled out, there will be very little big cotton left!" Zhou Shengxiang actually said: "Cut it all off! You don't want the small cotton in your village!" Under the order of the district head, the township cadres of Bianjiazhuang Township also had no choice but to lead the militia to forcibly pull the cotton of the masses. After the cotton of Zhao Kaishan, a farmer in Anzhuang Village, Seventh District, was pulled out, he went to the district and county to ask the government to make a decision for him. However, Zhao Kaishan's appeal was not only not properly handled, but also subjected to reprimands from county and district cadres. Guo Deren, a farmer in Guojiagou Village, Fenghuang Township, Third District, was sentenced to one month in prison by the township cadres for not pulling cotton.
    In the process of Zhang Zuochen and others forcing farmers to pull cotton, the Cangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China failed to correct it. In July, the Second District Committee requested instructions from the County Committee because the masses had opinions on the implementation of the cotton-pulling "task." The County Committee not only failed to raise its vigilance and correct the error, but also issued a notice under the chairmanship of Xu Xun, the secretary of the County Committee, requiring all districts to continue "clearing cotton fields," and proposed the extremely erroneous method of "compensating the losses of small cotton farmers by large cotton farmers." This erroneous notice was withdrawn only after being discovered and criticized by the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    This mistake of Zhang Zuochen and others caused great political and economic losses to the Party and the masses. According to statistics, a total of seven districts, eighteen townships, seventy-five villages, and one thousand three hundred and sixty households in the county were forced to pull cotton, destroying more than 490 mu of cotton fields. The loss amounted to tens of millions of yuan, making it difficult for some farmers to live because the cotton was pulled out. The occurrence of this incident not only caused great economic losses to the peasant masses, but also damaged the Party's production policy and undermined the Party's and the People's Government's political prestige among the masses.
    In mid-July, the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Linyi Prefectural Commissioner's Office discovered the incident and immediately stopped it, and urged the Cangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Cangshan County People's Government to conduct a review and send cadres to conduct a review with the peasant masses separately.
    Zhang Zuochen, the magistrate of Cangshan County, should be primarily responsible for causing this serious incident. At the same time, the Cangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and Xu Xun, the secretary of the County Committee, should bear political leadership responsibility. In this incident, Fu Zhongfa, the head of the Fourteenth District, Zhou Shengxiang, the head of the Tenth District, and Wei Diangang, the secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party of China in that district, not only did not care about the hardships of the masses and did not listen to the voices of the masses, but intensified their efforts and adopted various bad means to force the peasant masses to pull cotton, thus causing the cotton farmers in these two districts to suffer the most serious losses.
    After discovering the incident, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Supervision Commission of the Shandong Provincial People's Government sent cadres to Cangshan County to conduct on-site investigations. In order to protect the interests of the masses, strictly enforce national law and Party discipline, and educate cadres to improve their work, the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided: to expel Zhang Zuochen from the Party; to give the Cangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China a reprimand; to give Xu Xun, the secretary of the County Committee, the punishment of removal from his post; to give Wei Diangang the punishment of removal from his post; and to give Fu Zhongfa and Zhou Shengxiang warnings respectively. The Shandong Provincial People's Government decided to give Zhang Zuochen, the magistrate of Cangshan County, the punishment of dismissal from his post and hand him over to the judicial authorities for punishment. It also ordered the Linyi Prefectural Commissioner's Office to give Fu Zhongfa, the head of the Fourteenth District of Cangshan County, and Zhou Shengxiang, the head of the Tenth District, the punishment of dismissal from their posts. In addition, the county and district cadres who were irresponsible in receiving farmer Zhao Kaishan were instructed to be investigated and dealt with by the Linyi Prefectural Committee and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office respectively.
    In this incident, farmer Zhao Kaishan represented the opinions of the people and appealed to the district and county without success, and then filed a complaint to the Shandong Provincial People's Government. This spirit of upholding the truth and considering the interests of the masses was commended.

### 山东省苍山县县长张作臣强迫群众毁坏棉田受到严重处分

    山东省苍山县县长张作臣强迫群众毁坏棉田受到严重处分
    编者按：山东苍山县县长、中共苍山县委委员张作臣为了推广斯字棉而强迫群众拔除四百多亩棉花的事实，说明了个别县的负责干部的强迫命令作风非常严重。他们的任意损害人民群众利益的行为，是不能容忍的。这一事实也说明了某些干部的强迫命令的错误，是和领导机关的官僚主义分不开的。苍山县委就一直支持着张作臣的错误行动，甚至还提出了“种小棉户的损失由大棉户补偿”的极端错误的措施。临沂地委也是工作布置多，检查总结少，事务忙乱，不了解下情，以致发生了苍山县一再强迫群众“清理棉田”，毁坏棉花的错误。这应引起各地党委的深切注意。
    山东省苍山县长、中共苍山县委委员张作臣等强迫农民群众毁坏棉田，严重侵犯农民群众的利益和破坏党的生产政策的行为，是不能容忍的。中共中央山东分局及山东省人民政府，对张作臣等已分别予以处分。
    苍山县在前年开始提倡种植五爱斯字棉（当地农民称大棉）时，有些农民种了一部分，但由于动员教育不够和缺乏技术指导，除少数农民收益较好外，大部歉收。因此，去年再号召种五爱斯字棉时，许多农民思想不通，不愿种。其原因：一方面是恐怕种不好歉收；另一方面恐怕合作社不收购，拿去市场上出卖，又比普通棉（当地农民称小棉）价格低。去年春天种棉时，苍山县领导干部对农民群众的思想顾虑并不深切了解，又未很好动员教育，即强求农民群众一律种植斯字棉，当时并向农民提出：“不准种小棉花，如果种了小棉花，将来还要拔掉。”在这种情况下，许多农民采取了应付的态度，有的把强迫买来的斯字棉种籽扔掉，仍种小棉；有的是大小棉间种或混种；有的在地头上种上点斯字棉，地里边仍种小棉。苍山县长张作臣在发现此种情况后，不但未引起警惕，及时检查和纠正自己的官僚主义错误，反而在棉苗生长起来以后，曾五次在区、乡干部会议上错误地布置“清理棉田”，并且错误地提出了“早强迫比晚强迫好”的口号。会后不少种植棉花的区就进行了“清理”。去年六月二十日，已是棉花开花结桃的时候，张作臣还在区干部会议上强调提出：“清理棉田的任务，各区要坚决贯彻。”
    在张作臣的错误布置下，有些区的领导干部就强迫农民拔除小棉，严重地侵犯了群众利益。当时，乡、村干部和农民曾多次到区请求不拔小棉，有的区干部就不考虑农民群众的这种呼声和要求，反而命令乡干部率领民兵，组织青年团员，小学生带着镰刀，遍地检查，到处拔棉，甚而强令各村种棉户互相拔除。十四区区长傅忠法还批评武坦乡支部书记王兴奎、乡长赵景祥及峨旦村支部书记刘献斌，三次到区反映农民群众意见是“当了群众的尾巴”。最后，王兴奎等在区长的指责下，只好组织民兵，强迫农民拔棉，区长傅忠法并亲自到棉田督察。有的群众看到自己的棉花被割掉，就躺在地里大哭大骂，傅忠法还说：“我在这里你骂我，我走了你骂棉花吧！”十区卞家庄乡乡干部也几次到区反映农民群众的要求，提出：“今年种的小棉花太多，割了太可惜了！”而区长周胜祥说：“一百亩剩下十亩也要割。”中共卞家庄支部书记朱庆祥向周胜祥说：“俺村大部分种的是小棉花，如果拔掉小棉花，大棉花就剩下有限啦！”周胜祥竟说：“一起削掉吧！你村的小棉花不要啦！”卞家庄乡乡干部在区长的命令下，也只好率领着民兵强制群众拔了棉花。七区安庄村农民赵开山的棉花被拔掉后，
    他曾到区、县要求政府给他作主。但是，赵开山的
    申诉不仅未得到正确处理，反而遭到县、区干部的
    训斥。三区凤凰乡郭家沟村农民郭德仁因不拔棉花
    而被该乡乡干部判徒刑一个月。
    在张作臣等强迫农民拔棉过程中，中共苍山县委始终未能予以纠正。至七月间，二区区委因执行拔棉“任务”群众有意见，向县委请示，县委不仅未
    能引起警惕，纠正错误，反而在县委书记徐迅主持下，发出通知，要各区继续“清理棉田”，并提出
    “种小棉户的损失由种大棉户补偿”的极为错误的办法。经中共临沂地委发觉批评后，才将这一错误通知收回。
    张作臣等这一错误，给党和群众在政治上、经济上造成了很大损失。据统计全县被强迫拔棉的共有七个区，十八个乡，七十五个村，一千三百六十户，共毁坏棉田四百九十余亩。损失达数千万元，使部分农民因为棉花拔掉生活发生了困难。这一事件的发生，不但在经济上使农民群众遭受了极大的损失，并且破坏了党的生产政策，破坏了党和人民政府在群众中的政治威信。
    七月中旬，中共临沂地委及临沂专署发觉这一事件后，即予以制止，并督促中共苍山县委及苍山县人民政府进行检讨和派干部分头向农民群众进行检讨。
    酿成这一严重事件，苍山县县长张作臣应负主要责任。同时，中共苍山县委会与县委书记徐迅应负政治领导责任。在这一事件中，十四区区长傅忠法、十区区长周胜祥及该区中共区委书记韦殿冈等，不但毫不关心和体贴群众的疾苦，不倾听群众的呼声，反而变本加厉，采取各种恶劣手段，强迫农民群众拔棉，因而使这两个区棉农所受的损失最为严重。
    中共中央山东分局纪律检查委员会、山东省人民政府监察委员会发觉这一事件后，即派干部赴苍山县作了实地调查。为了保护群众利益，严肃国法和党的纪律并教育干部，改进工作，中共中央山东分局决定：开除张作臣党籍；给中共苍山县委会以指责处分；给县委书记徐迅以撤销工作的处分；给韦殿冈以撤销工作处分；分别给傅忠法、周胜祥以警告处分。山东省人民政府决定给苍山县县长张作臣以撤职处分、交司法机关惩办。并着令临沂专署给苍山县十四区区长傅忠法，十区区长周胜祥以撤职处分。另外，对接见农民赵开山不负责任的县、区干部，分别责成临沂地委和专署查实处理。
    在这一事件中，农民赵开山代表人民的意见，在区、县申诉未成，又向山东省人民政府提出控告。这种坚持真理，为群众利益着想的精神，受到了表扬。
