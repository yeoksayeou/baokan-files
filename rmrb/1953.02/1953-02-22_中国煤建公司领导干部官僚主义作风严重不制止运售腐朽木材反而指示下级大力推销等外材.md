According to a letter from reader Xin Zhenhuan: The bureaucratic attitude adopted by the China Coal Construction Materials Company in handling the matter of transporting and selling a large quantity of rotten timber from Northeast China to the interior is intolerable. Xin Zhenhuan said in his letter: I am an employee of the China Coal Construction Company and was ordered to participate in the work of the Supreme People's Procuratorate's timber inspection team. I feel that problems such as coal construction companies in various regions raising the grade of timber for sale, finding "ways to save funds" from workers' wages and workers' safety, and discrepancies between accounts and goods are very serious. However, due to the serious bureaucratic work style of the leaders of the China Coal Construction Company, these problems were either not discovered or, if discovered, were not investigated and resolved.

Before the People's Daily exposed the issue of rotten timber entering the customs from Northeast China on June 25, 1952, coal construction companies in North China had continuously reported various facts of losses caused by the use of rotten timber from Northeast China. However, this did not attract the attention of Section Chief Jin Yongjie of the China Coal Construction Company, who was in charge of this matter. He only notified the Northeast Coal Construction Company to pay attention to this issue with an official document, but did not come up with proper methods to check and solve it. As a result, rotten timber from Northeast China continued to enter the customs, and documents from North China reflecting losses caused by rotten timber continued to arrive. Section Chief Jin Yongjie irresponsibly wrote "Saved for future reference," "Handled together," and "Archived" on these documents. Later, when he learned that the Supreme People's Procuratorate was going to inspect the timber issue, he paid a little more attention, but he still did not inspect the rotten timber issue in Northeast China. Instead, he sent people to Shijiazhuang three times to "focus on inspecting logs." After a long inspection, the conclusion was "no results." He did not stop the rotten timber from Northeast China from entering the customs, nor did he properly handle the rotten timber that had entered the customs. Instead, he instructed coal construction companies in North China to "vigorously operate on substandard materials" and "vigorously promote substandard materials." Originally, the contract signed between the China Coal Construction Company and the Northeast Coal Construction Company did not allow for any "substandard materials." Now, the China Coal Construction Company instructs its subordinate companies to "vigorously promote substandard materials." The coal construction companies in various regions believe that there can be "substandard materials" for timber entering the customs and that they should "vigorously operate on" and "vigorously promote" them, which has caused serious consequences. On December 8th last year, when the Supreme People's Procuratorate convened relevant departments to hold a meeting to study the timber issue, Jin Yongjie represented the China Coal Construction Company and emphasized objective difficulties at the meeting, pushing all responsibilities away completely. On February 11th, when our company's manager convened a meeting to discuss reporting the rotten timber issue to the higher authorities, Jin Yongjie actually said: "Reporting my responsibilities as they are will probably result in being beheaded." The company manager actually agreed with his opinion and did not even mention Jin Yongjie's name. Recently, our company launched an anti-bureaucracy struggle. The manager gave a summary report of the work in 1952 to all personnel, in which the serious losses caused to the state by the entry of rotten timber from Northeast China was not mentioned at all. It can be seen that they do not intend to truly examine and get rid of the problem of bureaucracy.

I hate the bureaucratic work style of our company leaders very much. After working for several years, they still shamelessly say: "We are completely 'laymen' when it comes to timber." They also emphasize the difficulties of not understanding timber technology everywhere. However, I personally saw during this timber inspection work that Zhang Yunwen and Zhen Ziyi, two comrades from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, were indeed "laymen" when it came to timber. However, they became "experts" during the three-month inspection process. They have basically learned the necessary knowledge and technology about timber work. Comparing the two, I really don't know whether to laugh or cry. Our company's manager Li Nansheng and deputy manager Fan Juqiu are oblivious to business and blindly trust cadres like Jin Yongjie. Our company does not select cadres based on the standard of "both ability and integrity," but regards relatives and friends as "reliable" and those who are smooth, amiable, and pleasing as "activists." They are not good at uniting and transforming technical personnel to give play to their abilities and roles; those who dare to tell the truth, dare to express different opinions, and dare to criticize the leadership are regarded as "backward elements" and are subjected to attacks and retaliation at every turn. For a long time, the democratic atmosphere in our company has been very thin, so the shortcomings of the leadership and the abscesses in the work cannot be exposed, which has caused significant losses to state property and left a very bad impression of the state-owned coal construction company among the people.

The problems of the China Coal Construction Company are very serious. I suggest that the Central Ministry of Commerce and the Supreme People's Procuratorate conduct an effective inspection of the work of the China Coal Construction Company and handle it together with the case of rotten timber entering the customs.

### 中国煤建公司领导干部官僚主义作风严重不制止运售腐朽木材反而指示下级大力推销等外材

    中国煤建公司领导干部官僚主义作风严重不制止运售腐朽木材反而指示下级大力推销等外材
    据读者辛镇寰来信揭露：中国煤业建筑器材公司在处理东北大批腐朽木材运到关内销售这件事所采取的官僚主义态度，是令人不能容忍的。辛镇寰在来信中说：我是中国煤建公司的一个职员，我曾奉命参加最高人民检察署木材检查小组工作。我感到各地煤建公司出售木材时提高等级，在应发给工人的工资中和在工人的生命安全上找“节省经费的窍门”，以及账货不符等等问题，是十分严重的。但由于中国煤建公司领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风，这些问题或者没有发现，或者发现了也没有追究和解决。
    在一九五二年六月二十五日人民日报揭露东北腐朽木材进关问题以前，华北各地煤建公司就不断反映过由于使用东北腐朽木材造成损失的各种事实，但未引起中国煤建公司主办这件事的靳勇杰科长的重视，他只以公司的一纸公文通知东北煤建公司注意这个问题，但并不想出妥善办法检查解决。以致东北腐朽木材仍然源源进关，华北各地反映腐朽木材造成损失的文件也源源而来。靳勇杰科长却毫不负责任地在这些文件上批着“存查”“并案办理”
    “归档”等等。后来他知道最高人民检察署要检查木材问题，才稍微加以注意，但对于东北发生腐朽木材的事仍不去检查，反而三次派人到石家庄去“重点检查原木”，检查了很长时间，结论是“无结果”。他不去制止东北的腐朽木材进关，也不去妥善处理进关的腐朽木材，却指示华北各地煤建公司“大力经营等外材”，“大力推销等外材”。原来中国煤建公司和东北煤建公司所签订的合同，根本不允许有什么“等外材”。现在中国煤建公司指示下级公司“大力推销等外材”，各地煤建公司就认为进关木材可以有“等外材”，而且还要“大力经营”“大力推销”，这就造成了严重的恶果。去年十二月八日，最高人民检察署召集有关部门开会研究木材问题时，靳勇杰代表中国煤建公司出席，会中他强调客观困难，把一切责任都推得干干净净。二月十一日，我公司经理召开会议讨论向上级报告腐朽木材问题时，靳勇杰竟然说：“要把我的责任照样报上去恐怕要杀头。”公司经理居然同意了他的意见，连靳勇杰的名也不提。最近，我们公司里开展了反官僚主义斗争，经理向全体人员作了一九五二年度的工作总结报告，其中对东北腐朽木材进关给国家造成重大损失的事竟然没有提到。可见他们并不打算真正检讨和丢掉官僚主义这个毛病。
    我非常痛恨我们公司领导者的官僚主义作风。他们搞了好几年，仍然毫不知耻地说：“我们对于木材完全是‘外行’”。他们还到处强调不懂木材技术的困难。然而，我这次参加木材检查工作中亲眼看到，最高人民检察署的张允文、甄自义两同志，他们对于木材原来的确是“外行”，但他们在三个月的检查过程中就变成了“内行”，他们已基本上学会了关于木材工作的必需知识和技术。两相对照，真叫我啼笑皆非。我们公司的经理李南生、副经理范菊秋对于业务熟视无睹，就盲目信任像靳勇杰这样的干部。我们公司挑选干部不是以“德才兼备”为标准，而是把同乡亲友认为“可靠”，把圆滑可亲、随和可喜者封为“积极分子”。对于技术人员则不善于团结和改造，以发挥他们的能力和作用；对敢于说真话、敢于提出不同意见以及敢于批评领导的人，就视为“落后分子”，动不动就给予打击报复。长时期来，我们公司的民主空气十分稀薄，因而领导方面的缺点和工作中的脓包就不能被揭破，这就使得国家财产遭受了重大损失，也使得国营煤建公司在人民群众中留下了极恶劣的印象。
    中国煤建公司的问题是很严重的，我建议中央商业部和最高人民检察署对中国煤建公司的工作应作有效的检查，并与进关腐朽木材案件合并处理。
