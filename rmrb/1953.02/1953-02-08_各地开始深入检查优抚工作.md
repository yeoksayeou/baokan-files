Across various locations, in order to effectively carry out the work of preferential treatment in 1953, and in accordance with the "Joint Directive on Supporting the Army, Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers, and Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People" issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, which stipulated that an in-depth inspection of the preferential treatment work should be conducted, comprehensive and in-depth inspection work has begun in both urban and rural areas. The main content of the inspection is to see whether the livelihoods of the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers are guaranteed and whether their living standards have improved. If problems are found to still exist, they must be resolved in a timely manner.

Various locations have allocated personnel and established inspection organizations to carry out the inspection earnestly. The Lüda City has drawn 1,500 people from various agencies to form inspection teams. Shandong Province has established six inspection teams, and the Liaodong Provincial People's Government has formed seven inspection teams to go to various locations to assist local governments in inspecting preferential treatment work.

In rural areas, the focus is on inspecting the situation of substitute farming. The inspection team organized by the Shandong Provincial People's Government departed on January 16 for 11 special districts including Laiyang, Jiaozhou, Yishui, Linyi, Tengxian, Tai'an, Zibo, Changwei, Huimin, Dezhou, and Huxi, focusing on inspecting the substitute farming work in various locations. In addition to cooperating with local people's governments to convene representative meetings, forums, or cadre meetings of families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers in their hometowns, and demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns, the inspection teams will also conduct family visits. The provinces of Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang in Northeast China have all begun to conduct inspections of preferential treatment work in rural areas. After a recent inspection of the substitute farming work in Shimahe Township in the suburbs of Chongqing, all mutual aid teams contracted to farm for military families have enthusiastically launched challenges and accepted challenges, ensuring that they first do a good job of farming for military families.

In cities, the focus is on inspecting the organization of production for families of martyrs and soldiers and introducing them to employment opportunities. All districts in Beijing have begun to carry out inspection work universally, widely soliciting opinions from families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. The inspection team organized by Tianjin Municipality is now beginning to go to various agencies, organizations, and enterprises to conduct inspections, deeply understanding the production and employment situation of families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers. Cities such as Chongqing, Dihua, and Harbin have all begun to organize inspection teams to conduct inspection work. Many public and private enterprises in Chongqing are actively preparing to assist in solving the employment problems of families of martyrs and soldiers who are still unemployed.

    各地开始深入检查优抚工作
    为了做好一九五三年的优抚工作，各地已遵照中央人民政府内务部和人民革命军事委员会联合发布的关于拥军优属和拥政爱民指示中要对优抚工作进行一次深入检查的规定，开始在城市和乡村全面深入地进行检查工作。检查的主要内容，是看革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的生活有无保障和生活水平是否提高，如果发现还存在着问题，就要及时予以解决。
    各地都已调配了人员，成立了检查组织，切实进行检查。旅大市已从各机关抽调了一千五百人组织了检查组。山东省已成立六个检查组，辽东省人民政府已组成七个检查组分赴各地，协助各地政府检查优抚工作。
    在农村，着重检查代耕情况。山东省人民政府组织的检查组，已在一月十六日分赴莱阳、胶州、沂水、临沂、滕县、泰安、淄博、昌潍、惠民、德州、湖西等十一个专区，重点检查各地的代耕工作。检查组除协同各地人民政府召开烈、军属、在乡革命残废军人、转业回乡军人代表会、座谈会或干部会外，并将进行家庭访问。东北辽西、松江、黑龙江等省都已开始进行农村优抚工作的检查。重庆市郊石马河乡最近进行代耕工作的检查后，所有代军属包耕的互助组，都热烈展开挑战、应战，保证首先搞好军属的庄稼。
    在城市，着重检查组织烈、军属生产和为他们介绍职业等情况。北京市各区都已开始普遍地进行检查工作，广泛征集革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的意见。天津市组织的检查组，现在开始分赴各机关、团体、企业单位进行检查，深入了解烈、军属和革命残废军人的生产就业情况。重庆、迪化、哈尔滨等市都已开始组织检查组，进行检查工作，重庆市有不少公私营企业，都积极准备协助解决尚在失业的烈、军属的就业问题。
