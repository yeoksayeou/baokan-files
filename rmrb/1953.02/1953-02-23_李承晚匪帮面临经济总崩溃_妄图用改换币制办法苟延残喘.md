Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Due to the uncontrollable hyperinflation, the Li Seung-man puppet regime announced a currency reform swindle on the 15th, attempting to maintain its brutal rule through open plunder. The so-called currency reform is to replace the old puppet currency "Won" with the new puppet currency "Hwan," with an exchange rate of 100 Won for 1 Hwan. However, during the exchange period, each person can only exchange 500 Hwan, and the remaining money will be given "receipts" by the government, with payment temporarily suspended. And 500 Hwan is equivalent to 50,000 old Won, which can only buy one-third of a small dou of rice in South Korea. The Li Seung-man gang, already financially exhausted, is implementing this insane plunder, which will inevitably cause huge losses and the pain of bankruptcy to millions of South Koreans in the short term.

The Li gang's currency reform immediately caused chaos in South Korea. Many American news agency reports revealed that shops in major cities were closing down, and prices rose to two to five times their original levels. In Seoul, puppet police patrolled everywhere, forcing shops to open.

Li Seung-man issued a statement on the 16th. In his statement, he tried his best to conceal the collapsed economic state of South Korea, but he had to admit that the amount of currency in circulation in South Korea had expanded to 18 times before the US-Li gang launched the Korean War in 1950. He complained about his American masters, saying that the "chaotic situation" during the period of the American military government and the Economic Cooperation Administration was one of the reasons for the current inflation. The agreement between the United States and "South Korea" to issue approximately 1.5 billion Won of currency per day is a direct cause of the current state. Everyone knows that the American aggressors are conducting war in Korea, and the Li Seung-man gang must supply tens of billions of Won every month, one of the main sources of this money is the issuance of currency. According to the Li Seung-man gang's statistics, the accumulated amount of this advance payment has reached 87 million US dollars. Regarding the repayment of this amount, the US-Li gang has been bargaining and arguing for a long time. Although the Li Seung-man gang hoped that the United States could fully repay this advance payment in US dollars as a "stabilizer" for the new puppet currency during this currency reform, according to International News Service, "American officials stated that the United States has not yet agreed to fully repay the South Korean government in US dollars."

The Li Seung-man gang's so-called currency reform obviously cannot save it from the economic crisis it faces. The original factors causing inflation still exist, and new factors are emerging. The new budget, which will only be implemented in April, will have a deficit nearly as large as the normal annual revenue. It can be seen that the so-called currency reform is only the beginning of another vicious cycle of inflation, which, together with the military crisis, will send the Li Seung-man gang to the grave faster.

### 李承晚匪帮面临经济总崩溃  妄图用改换币制办法苟延残喘

    李承晚匪帮面临经济总崩溃
    妄图用改换币制办法苟延残喘
    【新华社二十一日讯】由于恶性的通货膨胀已不可收拾，李承晚伪政权在十五日宣布了改换币制的骗局，企图以敲骨吸髓的公开掠夺办法，来维持它的残暴统治。所谓币改的办法是以新伪币“圜”代替旧伪币“圆”，兑换率是每一百圆换一圜。但在兑换期间，每人只能兑换五百圜，其余的钱由政府出给“收据”，暂缓兑付。而五百圜合旧币五万圆，在南朝鲜只能买到一小斗米的三分之一。在财政上早已山穷水尽的李承晚匪帮实行的这种疯狂的掠夺办法，势将使千百万南朝鲜人在短期内遭受巨大的损失和破产的痛苦。
    李匪帮的改换币制，在南朝鲜立即引起了混乱。美国通讯社许多消息透露：各大城市的商店家家关门，物价上涨到原来价格的二倍到五倍。在汉城，伪警察四出巡行，强迫商店开门。
    李承晚在十六日发表声明。他在声明中竭力掩盖南朝鲜崩溃的经济状态，但是他不得不承认，南朝鲜通货流通额已膨胀到一九五零年美李匪帮发动侵朝战争前的十八倍。他埋怨他的美国主子说：美国军政府和经济合作总署管辖期间所发生的“混乱情况”，是造成目前通货膨胀的一种原因。美国与“韩国”所同意的每天发约十五亿圆通货的协议，是造成目前状态的直接原因。大家知道，美国侵略者在朝鲜进行战争，每月要李承晚匪帮供应数百亿圆的巨款，这笔钱的主要来源之一就是发行通货。据李承晚匪帮的统计，这笔垫付的款项累计已达八千七百万美元。关于这笔款项的偿还问题，美李匪帮曾经长期讨价还价争论不休。虽然李承晚匪帮在这次改换币制时希望美国能够以美元十足偿付这笔垫款，作为新伪币的“安定剂”，但是，据国际新闻社透露，“美国人士表示美国还没有同意十足以美元偿付韩国政府”。
    李承晚匪帮的所谓改换币制，显然不能挽救它面临总崩溃的经济危机。原有的造成通货膨胀的因素依然存在，而新的因素又在产生，仅将在四月间开始实施的新预算，赤字就将近正常岁收的一倍那么大。由此可见，所谓改换币制只是另一次恶性循环的通货膨胀的开始，它将和军事危机一起，更快地把李承晚匪帮送进坟墓。
