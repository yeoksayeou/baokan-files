Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: The All-China Women's Federation issued a notice to all levels of democratic women's federations to endorse and implement the directives and supplementary directives of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council of the Central People's Government on implementing the Marriage Law, and to commemorate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day.

Currently, in order to implement the directives on implementing the Marriage Law issued by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council of the Central People's Government on November 26, 1952, and February 1, 1953, respectively, democratic women's federations at all levels in various regions have, under the leadership of the local CCP committees, participated in the preparatory work and pilot projects for the Marriage Law implementation month in March this year. The vast majority of democratic women's federations have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in their work, achieved some results, and gained preliminary experience. Now that the Marriage Law implementation month is approaching, and the movement to publicize the Marriage Law and inspect its implementation is about to be fully launched, democratic women's federations at all levels should better study and implement the aforementioned two directives and the supplementary directive on the work of the Marriage Law implementation month issued by the CCP Central Committee on February 18, 1953. Under the unified leadership of the local CCP committees and the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, they should closely cooperate with all relevant parties, concentrate their efforts, and participate in the movement more conscientiously and actively. To this end, the following notice is hereby issued:

(1) Democratic women's federations at all levels should lead their cadres to repeatedly and deeply study the Marriage Law and the aforementioned three directives, especially to enable women's federation cadres at the county, district, and township levels to correctly understand the Marriage Law, profoundly understand the principles, policies, purposes, and methods of the Marriage Law implementation movement, improve their policy level, and encourage them to actively participate in the great movement to implement the Marriage Law. They should become excellent propagandists who correctly publicize the Marriage Law to the masses, become strong supporters of the masses in striving for gender equality and freedom of marriage, become diligent servants who truly protect the interests of women and serve the women masses, and become models of unity and cooperation with local cadres participating in the Marriage Law implementation movement. The leadership of women's federations at all levels must pay attention to further eliminating the remaining feudal ideas regarding marriage among their cadres in this movement, ensuring that their cadres no longer engage in criminal acts of participating in the persecution of women or the heinous practice of failing to provide assistance in emergencies, or interfering with the masses' demands for freedom of marriage in violation of the law. They must also earnestly overcome the bad bureaucratic work style of disregarding the interests of the women masses and forcing the completion of tasks through coercion.

(2) During the Marriage Law implementation month, in addition to actively participating in the work of the local Marriage Law Implementation Office, democratic women's federations at all levels should repeatedly publicize the Marriage Law to the women masses through various women's representative meetings and women's organizations, and fully explain the policies in order to achieve implementation at every level. During the publicity, they should follow the publicity content and methods proposed in the supplementary directive on the work of the Marriage Law implementation month issued by the CCP Central Committee on February 18, 1953, starting from the existing level of awareness of the women masses, and starting from the vital interests of the women masses, patiently and specifically explaining. In particular, it is necessary to make the women masses understand that implementing the Marriage Law is an important step in realizing gender equality and women's liberation, and is a good way to establish democratic, harmonious, united, and productive happy families. In this movement, democratic women's federations at all levels should continue to implement the decision on women's publicity and education work adopted by the first publicity and education work conference of the Federation, fully implement the principle of using the power of the entire Federation to carry out publicity and education work, concentrate efforts, promote the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, and during the progress of this movement, should accumulate publicity and education materials at any time, summarize experience, and promote good experiences approved by the leadership to improve the Federation's publicity and education work.

During the Marriage Law implementation month, democratic women's federations at all levels should fulfill their duties and give full play to the organizational role of the Federation, so that it truly becomes an organization that represents the women masses and protects their interests. On this basis, improve the organization of democratic women's federations at all levels. To this end, in addition to carrying out publicity and education work on the implementation of the Marriage Law to the women masses during the movement month, it is also necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the women masses in accordance with the spirit and methods of the aforementioned three directives. Serious attention should be paid to incidents in which women are seriously persecuted, resulting in personal injury or death. Relevant departments should be united to provide sincere sympathy and support, and help the victimized women solve their difficulties, and support them in filing complaints with the People's Government and the People's Court until they receive a fair and reasonable settlement; however, the handling of these cases should be the responsibility of the relevant departments of the People's Government, and the Women's Federation cannot handle them on their behalf.

After the movement month is over, democratic women's federations at all levels should make it a regular task to publicize the Marriage Law to the masses and assist the government in implementing the Marriage Law.

(3) This year's activities to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day by women's federations at all levels can be combined with the Marriage Law implementation movement. The focus of commemorative meetings or other activities should be on publicizing the implementation of the Marriage Law to women and women cadres, and further encouraging women to actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, participate in the planned construction of the motherland, and prepare to participate in the election work of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels and the preparatory work for the Second National Women's Congress. In addition, women cadres and women masses should be further educated to recognize that building the motherland and defending world peace are two closely related glorious tasks. Therefore, under certain conditions, the significance of the World Women's Congress to be held in Denmark in June this year should be appropriately publicized to strengthen the spirit of internationalism.

From now until the end of the movement, women's federations at all levels should promptly report the situation of participation in the movement, the problems discovered, and the experiences summarized to the higher levels, and improve the reporting system and the request for instructions system. Women's federations above the provincial and municipal levels should report to the All-China Women's Federation. The work of commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day can be reported at the same time as the work of implementing the Marriage Law.

    纪念“三八”节活动可与贯彻婚姻法运动结合起来
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为拥护和执行中共中央及中央人民政府政务院关于贯彻执行婚姻法的指示、补充指示及纪念今年“三八”国际妇女节给各级民主妇联的通知
    目前各地各级民主妇联为了执行中共中央及中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年十一月二十六日和一九五三年二月一日分别发出的关于贯彻婚姻法的指示，业已在当地中共党委领导之下参加了今年三月贯彻婚姻法运动月的准备工作和试点工作，绝大部分地区的民主妇联，在工作中表现了高度的积极性，做出了一些成绩，取得了初步经验。现在贯彻婚姻法运动月即将到来，宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况的运动即将全面地开展；因此各地各级民主妇联应更好地学习和执行前述两个指示及一九五三年二月十八日中共中央发表的关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示，在当地中共党委和贯彻婚姻法运动委员会统一领导之下，与有关各方面密切合作，集中力量，更加认真积极地参加运动。为此，特通知如下：
    （一）各级民主妇联应领导所属干部反复地深刻地学习婚姻法及前述的三个指示，尤其要使县、区、乡三级妇联干部，能正确地认识婚姻法，深刻地领会贯彻婚姻法运动的方针、政策、目的和作法，提高她们的政策水平，鼓励她们积极地参加贯彻婚姻法的大运动，成为向群众正确宣传婚姻法的优秀的宣传员，成为对群众争取男女平等、婚姻自由的有力的支持者，成为真正能保护妇女群众利益、为妇女群众服务的勤务员，成为与当地参加贯彻婚姻法运动的干部团结合作的模范。各级妇联领导上一定要注意在这次运动中更进一步清除所属干部中有关婚姻问题方面的封建残余思想，要保证所属干部再不发生参与迫害妇女的犯罪行为或见死不救、死了不问的恶劣作风，再不发生维护封建婚姻、干涉群众要求婚姻自由的违法行为，并要认真克服干部中漠视妇女群众利益和强迫命令完成任务的恶劣的官僚主义作风。
    （二）在贯彻婚姻法运动月中，各地各级民主妇联除积极参加当地贯彻婚姻法办公室的工作外，更应通过各种妇女代表会议各种妇女组织向妇女群众反复地宣传婚姻法，全面地交代政策，以达到层层贯彻。在宣传时应遵照一九五三年二月十八日中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示中所提出的宣传内容和方式，要从妇女群众现有的觉悟水平出发，要从妇女群众切身利益出发，循循善诱，具体解释。特别要使妇女群众懂得贯彻婚姻法是实现男女平等、妇女解放的重要步骤，是建立民主和睦团结生产的美满家庭的好办法；各级民主妇联，在这次运动中，应继续贯彻本会第一次宣传教育工作会议所通过的妇女宣传教育工作的决定，要充分执行用全会力量作宣传教育工作的方针，集中力量，推进宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动，在这次运动进行过程中，应随时累积宣传教育资料，总结经验，并推广领导上批准的好经验，把妇联的宣传教育工作提高一步。
    在贯彻婚姻法运动月中，各地各级民主妇联应善尽其职，充分发挥妇联的组织作用，使之真正成为代表妇女群众、保护妇女群众利益的组织，在这基础上，健全各级民主妇联的组织。为此，在运动月中，除了向妇女群众进行贯彻婚姻法的宣传教育工作外，更应根据前述三个指示的精神和办法，保护妇女群众的合法利益。而对于妇女受严重迫害以致伤害人身残害人命事件，应十分重视，要联合有关各部门切实给予同情支持，并帮助受害的妇女解决困难，支持她们向人民政府、人民法院提出控诉，直到获得公平合理的处理为止；但是处理这些案件应由人民政府有关部门负责，妇联不能代为处理。
    在运动月过去以后，各级民主妇联要把向群众宣传婚姻法、协助政府执行婚姻法作为经常工作任务。
    （三）今年各级妇联纪念“三八”国际妇女节的活动可以与贯彻婚姻法运动结合起来，在纪念会上或其他活动中均以向妇女群众和妇女干部宣传贯彻婚姻法为中心，并进而鼓励妇女群众更加积极参加抗美援朝运动、参加祖国有计划的建设工作及准备参加全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的选举工作和全国第二次妇女代表大会的准备工作。此外并应更进一步教育妇女干部及妇女群众认识建设祖国和保卫世界和平，是密切相关联的两大光荣任务，因此在一定的条件下，应适当地宣传将在今年六月在丹麦召开的世界妇女大会的意义，以加强国际主义的思想。
    从现在到运动结束为止，各级妇联应将参加运动的情况、发现的问题和总结的经验，及时按层上报，健全报告制度和请示制度。省、市以上妇联应向全国妇联汇报。关于今年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的工作，可与贯彻婚姻法运动的工作同时汇报。
