Currently, the China Chemical Industry Equipment Company has 12,127 tons of hardened oil in stock, occupying more than 150 billion yuan in capital. Bank credit interest and storage costs of 38 billion yuan have already been paid. This loss was caused by the department producing this batch of hardened oil blindly raising prices and the poor management of the former China Industrial Equipment Company and its Northeast regional company.

This batch of stockpiled hardened oil was produced by the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau. Before August 1951, the hardened oil managed by the former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company was about 25 percent lower than the market price of tallow or lard (4.5 million yuan per ton for 45-degree hardened oil, 8.1 million yuan per ton for 60-degree hardened oil), and sales were very good at that time. The Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau, which produced hardened oil, saw that hardened oil was selling well, and then raised the transfer price twice: in August 1951, taking the opportunity of raising the transfer price of soybean oil, the raw material for manufacturing hardened oil, by 25.9 percent, the transfer price of hardened oil was increased by 33.7 percent. After that, although the transfer price of soybean oil was not fixed, it was not raised. On January 11, 1952, the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau again raised the transfer price of hardened oil by 42.8 percent with the approval of the former Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee, on the grounds that the transfer price of soybean oil had been raised. In fact, the industrial profit was as high as 35 percent, while the Bureau falsely reported that the industrial profit was less than 20 percent. The Trade and Cooperation Department of the former Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee unilaterally listened to the Bureau's falsely reported costs and profits, and mistakenly approved the request to raise the transfer price of hardened oil. On January 11, 1952, the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau raised the transfer price of 45-degree hardened oil to 14 million yuan per ton, and 60-degree hardened oil to 16 million yuan per ton. The former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company also raised the selling price to 15 million yuan and 17.5 million yuan per ton respectively. The 45-degree hardened oil produced by the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau accounted for 80 to 90 percent of the total production of hardened oil. Because of its low melting point, the soap or perfumed soap manufactured was soft, not durable, and had high viscosity, so it was not popular in the market. Before the price increase, soap manufacturers were willing to purchase it because of the cheap price, but after the excessive price increase, the sales of hardened oil narrowed. The sales volume of hardened oil in Shenyang decreased from an average of 300 tons per quarter in 1951 to less than 30 tons per quarter in 1952. The major soap industries in the inland cities, which had always used 60-degree hardened oil produced in the Northeast as raw material, also sought other ways out due to the high price of hardened oil. For example, Shanghai Wuzhou and other soap factories used tallow oil, which was cheaper than tallow and lard, to replace hardened oil. According to statistics, the total sales volume of hardened oil of the former China Industrial Equipment Company in 1952 decreased by 75 percent compared with 1951.

In the third quarter of last year, when the former China Industrial Equipment Company cleared its inventory and implemented commodity ranking, it found the serious situation of stockpiled hardened oil, and took measures to stop purchasing and reduce prices. As a result, 3,019 tons of hardened oil produced by the industrial sector in the fourth quarter of last year were stockpiled, and the products of the first quarter of this year will also be completely stockpiled. Since the soap manufacturing industry has replaced hardened oil with tallow, lard, and tallow oil, the sales of hardened oil have not improved for a while after the price reduction.

The former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company did not play a role in promoting the combination of production and sales and supporting production in the management of hardened oil, resulting in a serious situation of stockpiling hardened oil. The former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company bears an important responsibility for the issue of raising the price of hardened oil. If the former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company could correctly report the hardened oil sales situation to the organ that decides the hardened oil transfer price, it could stop this inappropriate price increase. (Of course, the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau should bear the main responsibility for simply pursuing profits and repeatedly requesting price increases, and the Trade and Cooperation Department of the former Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee should also bear the main responsibility for approving it rashly without research.) The former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company exclusively sold hardened oil, but did not take effective measures to guide and supervise the production department to improve production, which is also one of the reasons for the stockpiling of hardened oil.

The former China Industrial Equipment Company should also bear certain responsibility for this problem. It did not urge the former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company to promptly raise the issue of reasonably solving the price of hardened oil to the relevant departments. The 45-degree hardened oil was unsalable in the inland market. The former China Industrial Equipment Company neither promptly instructed the former Northeast Industrial Equipment Company to study ways to improve the product with the production department, nor revised the original plan for selling hardened oil in the inland. This lesson should attract the attention of all cadres in the production and trade departments.

    东北化学工业管理局和原中国工业器材公司等单位盲目提高硬化油价格以致产品卖不出去
    目前，中国化学工业器材公司积压着一万二千一百二十七吨硬化油，占用了一千五百余亿元的资金。已付出银行信贷利息和保管费用三百八十亿元。这种损失是生产这批硬化油的部门盲目提高价格和原中国工业器材公司及所属东北区公司经营不善所造成的。
    这批被积压的硬化油，是东北化学工业管理局生产的。在一九五一年八月以前，原东北区工业器材公司经营的硬化油比牛油或猪油的市场价格约低百分之二十五（四十五度硬化油每吨七百六十万元，六十度硬化油每吨八百一十万元），当时销路甚畅。生产硬化油的东北化学工业管理局看到硬化油畅销，就先后两次提高了调拨价格：一九五一年八月乘制造硬化油的原料——豆油调拨价上提百分之二十五点九的机会，将硬化油的调拨价格提高了百分之三十三点七。此后，豆油的调拨价格虽不固定，但并未上提。一九五二年一月十一日东北化学工业管理局又以豆油的调拨价格上调为理由，经前东北人民经济计划委员会批准，将硬化油的调拨价格再提高百分之四十二点八，这样工业利润实际上已高达百分之三十五强，而该局谎报工业利润尚不足百分之二十。前东北人民经济计划委员会贸易合作处片面听信该局虚报的成本和利润，错误地批准了提高硬化油调拨价格的要求。一九五二年一月十一日东北化学工业管理局把四十五度硬化油调拨价提高到每吨一千四百万元，六十度硬化油提高到每吨一千六百万元。原东北区工业器材公司也就把卖价分别提高到每吨一千五百万元和一千七百五十万元。东北化学工业管理局生产的四十五度硬化油占硬化油总产量的百分之八十到九十，由于它的熔点低，制造出来的肥皂或香皂质软、不耐用、粘度大，所以在市场上不受欢迎。在调价以前，因价格便宜，制造肥皂的厂商还愿意购用，但在过高地提价以后，硬化油的销路就狭窄了。硬化油在沈阳市的销售量，由一九五一年平均每季三百吨降低到一九五二年平均每季尚不足三十吨。一向以东北生产的六十度硬化油为原料的关内各大城市的肥皂工业，也因硬化油价格太高，都纷纷另寻出路。比如上海五洲等肥皂工厂，都用比牛油、猪油还便宜的桕油代替硬化油。据统计，原中国工业器材公司一九五二年硬化油总销售量比一九五一年减少了百分之七十五。
    去年第三季度，原中国工业器材公司清理库存和实行商品排队的时候，检查出积压硬化油的严重情况，便采取了停止收购和减价销售的办法。结果工业部门在去年第四季度生产的硬化油积压了三千零一十九吨，今年第一季度的生产品也将要全部积压起来。由于肥皂制造工业已用牛油、猪油、桕油代替硬化油，所以硬化油调低价格以后，销路一时还没有起色。
    原东北区工业器材公司在经营硬化油的时候，没有起到促进产销结合和扶助生产的作用，造成了硬化油积压的严重情况。在调高硬化油价格的问题上，原东北区工业器材公司是负有重要的责任的。原东北区工业器材公司如能正确地把硬化油推销情况报告给决定硬化油调拨价格的机关，是可以停止这种不适当地提价的。（当然，东北化学工业管理局单纯追逐利润，一再提出提价的要求，前东北人民经济计划委员会贸易合作处未加研究即草率批准，都应负主要责任。）原东北区工业器材公司全部包销硬化油，但又没有采取有效办法指导、督促生产部门改进生产，也是造成硬化油积压的原因之一。
    对于这个问题，原中国工业器材公司也要负一定的责任。它没有督促原东北区工业器材公司及时向有关部门提出合理地解决硬化油价格的问题。四十五度硬化油在关内市场滞销，原中国工业器材公司既未及时指示原东北区工业器材公司与生产部门研究改进产品的办法，也没有修改原来硬化油在关内销售的计划。这种教训，应该引起生产、贸易部门全体干部的注意。
