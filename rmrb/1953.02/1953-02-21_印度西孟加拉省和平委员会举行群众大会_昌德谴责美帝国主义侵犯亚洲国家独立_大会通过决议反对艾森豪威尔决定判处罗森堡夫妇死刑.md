(Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th) A mass rally was held by the Peace Committee of West Bengal, India, on the 13th in the Islamic College Hall in Calcutta. The famous Indian peace activist and economist, Dr. Gyan Chand, delivered a speech at the meeting entitled "Asia and the United States." The attendees unanimously passed a resolution expressing outrage at Eisenhower's decision to sentence the Rosenbergs to death and demanding that Eisenhower reconsider this decision.

In his speech, Gyan Chand pointed out that US imperialism is the main enemy in the path of Asian peoples, who have awakened, in developing their political, social, and economic lives. In preparation for war against the Soviet Union and China, the United States has established huge military bases in almost the entire region of Asia, from Japan to Syria. Chand said that the United States is exerting tremendous pressure on India to drag it directly into the imperialist war. It is currently making every effort to drag Pakistan into the "Middle East Defense Organization," and this effort is also aimed at putting pressure on India. Chand also cited many facts of the infiltration of US forces into India.

Analyzing the actions of the United States in Asia, Chand said that the United States is establishing bases in one country after another, while also shipping in military equipment and sending military delegations and military experts. Through these activities, they cause those countries to lose their national independence and sovereignty. On the other hand, US imperialism is blocking the path of the awakened masses of Asian countries in their struggle for freedom, progress, and social development. Today, the United States has acted as the main protector of the most hateful reactionaries in various countries. They give money and support to the reactionaries in various countries, planning to prevent the people of various countries from realizing their hopes and aspirations.

Chand then described the expansion of US influence in Japan, the Philippines, Indochina, Burma, Ceylon, Afghanistan, and Iran. He said that India is also facing this great danger today. He called on the audience to recognize this and guard against it.

Professor Bhattacharya, Chairman of the meeting and a member of the West Bengal Provincial Assembly, then delivered a speech. He said that US imperialism is now trying to turn the entire Asia into a huge prison. He called on Indian workers, peasants, and the middle class to organize to save India from US control. He concluded by expressing his firm belief that if the Asian people organize and fight, they will surely be able to thwart the American conspiracy in Asia.

    印度西孟加拉省和平委员会举行群众大会
    昌德谴责美帝国主义侵犯亚洲国家独立
    大会通过决议反对艾森豪威尔决定判处罗森堡夫妇死刑
    【新华社新德里二十日电】印度西孟加拉省和平委员会十三日在加尔各答的回教学院大厅举行大会。印度著名和平人士、经济学家吉安·昌德博士在会上发表演讲，讲题是“亚洲和美国”。到会的人并一致通过决议，对艾森豪威尔决定判处罗森堡夫妇死刑表示愤慨，要求艾森豪威尔重新考虑这个决定。
    吉安·昌德在演讲中指出：美帝国主义是在觉醒了的亚洲人民发展政治、社会和经济生活的道路上的主要敌人。为了准备对苏联和中国进行战争，美国在几乎整个亚洲，从日本到叙利亚，都建立了庞大的军事基地。昌德说，美国正对印度施用巨大的压力，要把印度直接拉入帝国主义战争中。它目前正竭力要把巴基斯坦拉入“中东防御组织”，这种努力的目的也是在于给印度压力。昌德还举出美国势力渗入印度的许多事实。
    昌德分析美国在亚洲的行动时说，美国在一个国家又一个国家建立基地，同时还运来军事装备，派来军事代表团和军事专家。他们通过这些活动，使那些国家丧失民族独立和主权。另一方面，美帝国主义阻塞了亚洲国家觉醒了的广大人民争取自由、进步和社会发展的道路。美国今天已充当了各国最可恨的反动派的主要保护者。他们给各国反动派以金钱和支持，计划阻止各国人民实现他们的希望和愿望。
    昌德接着叙述了美国在日本、菲律宾、印度支那、缅甸、锡兰、阿富汗、伊朗扩充势力的情况。他说，印度今天也面临着这种巨大的危险。他号召听众认识这一点，谨防这一点。
    接着由大会主席、西孟加拉省议会议员巴塔查里雅教授致词。他说：美帝国主义今天正想要把整个亚洲变为庞大的监狱。他呼吁印度工人、农民和中产阶级组织起来拯救印度，使它免受美国的控制。他最后表示，他深信亚洲人民组织起来进行斗争，一定能挫败美国在亚洲的阴谋。
