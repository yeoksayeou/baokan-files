The political education phase of the winter training for construction workers in Tianjin is nearing its end. The technical education phase will begin after the Spring Festival holiday. However, the preparation work for the technical education is progressing very slowly. Many specific preparations have not yet started, and even the technical education plan has not been drawn up. Some cadres only understand the goals to be achieved by technical learning in principle, but they all think "it's a problem" how to achieve these goals.

Currently, most of the cadres and instructors responsible for winter training have been transferred from other positions. They are not familiar with the technology and construction management of capital construction, making it difficult to lead the technical education work. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to absorb technical cadres and advanced technical workers to participate in the research and leadership of technical education. However, this organizational preparation has not yet materialized. At the beginning of last week, the Winter Training Committee tentatively decided that Shao Qinghua, vice chairman of the Construction Workers' Union, would specifically take charge of the next stage of technical education, but Shao Qinghua was unaware of this even by February 1. Currently, the Winter Training Committee has only temporarily drawn an engineer from the Workers' Construction Company to study and compile teaching materials.

In the technical education phase, according to the teaching principle of "learn what you do," in addition to lectures, various operation demonstrations and observations should also be organized. This requires preparing sufficient tools, materials, and demonstration locations for each type of work. This heavy preparation work has not yet begun in Tianjin. Some cadres think that as long as there is an open space, demonstrations can be performed, which is an oversimplified view of the work.

In order to make technical education meet the actual needs of workers, workers of all trades, especially advanced producers and veteran technical workers, should be involved in the research and their opinions should be heard during the preparation period. In fact, the vast majority of workers are extremely eager to learn technology. Currently, many groups are automatically conducting technical studies in their spare time, and have initially created some learning methods and experiences such as mutual teaching and mutual learning. However, the issue of technical learning has not yet been discussed with the workers, and some workers are not even aware that technical learning will be carried out after the Spring Festival holiday.

The extremely slow progress in the preparation of technical education is inseparable from the insufficient attention paid to the entire winter training work by the relevant units. When the Winter Training Committee was established, the managers of various construction companies agreed to transfer sufficient cadres from their units, but then used difficulties as an excuse and refused to transfer cadres according to the plan. As a result, the Winter Training Committee's original staffing of fifty-five people was actually only twenty-odd cadres, resulting in weak leadership and a situation of simply coping. Because the work is not thorough, many problems in workers' political learning cannot be solved in a timely manner, and the work of the technical education phase cannot be prepared for early.

Under such circumstances, the Winter Training Committee and its branches did not actively try to strengthen leadership, but simply waited. The cadres of the Winter Training Committee believe that it is difficult to specifically study the problems of technical education at present, and they have to wait until the technical personnel and workers participating in the national construction industry advanced experience training class graduate. The branches simply wait for the unified deployment of the Winter Training Committee, and do not take necessary measures on their own initiative. The result of mutual waiting is that the preparation of technical education is delayed again and again, and has not yet begun to be actively carried out.

In addition, some cadres responsible for winter training do not understand the complexity of technical education work, and even think that all specific preparations can be completed in a concentrated effort during the Spring Festival holiday. In fact, it is impossible to do a series of technical education preparations in a short holiday. The Tianjin Winter Training Committee must pay attention to this situation, and on the one hand, continue to strengthen political education, and on the other hand, take necessary measures to quickly prepare all the technical education work.

### 天津市冬训技术教育准备工作进展迟缓

    天津市冬训技术教育准备工作进展迟缓
    天津市建筑工人冬季训练政治教育阶段接近结束，春节假期以后即将进入技术教育阶段，但目前技术教育的准备工作进展非常迟缓，许多具体准备工作尚未开始，甚至连技术教育的计划还没有订出。有些干部只原则地了解技术学习要求达到的目标，但如何达到这个目标，他们都认为“是个问题”。
    目前负责冬训工作的干部、辅导员绝大部分是从其他工作岗位上调来的，对基本建设的技术和施工管理等业务不熟悉，很难领导技术教育工作，因此亟需吸收技术干部和先进的技术工人参加技术教育的研究和领导工作。但这一组织准备工作目前尚无眉目。上周初，冬训委员会曾初步确定由建筑工会副主席邵清华具体掌握下一阶段的技术教育，但直到二月一日，邵清华还不知道这件事。现在冬训委员会只有从工人建筑公司临时抽调的一个工程师在研究编写教材。
    在技术教育阶段，根据做什么学什么的教学方针，除讲课外，还应组织各种操作表演和观摩，这就需要准备足够的各工种的工具、材料和表演操作的地点。这一繁重的准备工作天津市也还没有开始进行。有的干部认为只要有空场子就可以表演，把这一工作看得过于简单了。
    为了使技术教育切合工人的实际需要，还应在准备期间吸收各工种的工人、特别是先进生产者和老技术工人共同研究，听取他们的意见。实际上，广大工人对学习技术的要求极为迫切，目前已有不少小组自动在课余时间进行技术学习，并初步创造了一些互教互学等学习的方法和经验。但至今关于技术学习问题还没有和工人研究过，甚至有些工人还不知道春节假期以后要进行技术学习。
    技术教育的准备工作进展非常迟缓，是和各有关单位对整个冬训工作重视不够分不开的。冬训委员会成立时，各建筑公司经理曾同意由本单位抽调足够的干部，但随后即借口困难，不肯按计划抽调，以致冬训委员会原定编制五十五人，实际却只有二十多个干部，领导力量薄弱，陷于应付局面。由于工作不深入，工人政治学习中的不少问题不能及时解决，技术教育阶段的工作也不能及早进行准备。
    在这样的情况下，冬训委员会及各分会并未积极设法加强领导，而是单纯等待。冬训委员会的干部认为目前对技术教育的问题很难具体研究，只好等着参加全国建筑业先进经验训练班的技术人员和工人毕业以后再说；各分会则单纯等待着冬训委员会统一布置，也没有主动采取必要的措施。互相等待的结果，就使技术教育的准备工作一拖再拖，至今没有开始积极进行。
    此外，负责冬训工作的某些干部不了解技术教育工作的复杂性，竟认为所有的具体准备工作都可以在春节休假期间突击完成，事实上在短短的假期内要做好一系列的技术教育准备工作是不可能的。天津市冬训委员会必须重视这种情况，一方面继续加强政治教育，一方面采取必要的措施，迅速做好技术教育的一切准备工作。
