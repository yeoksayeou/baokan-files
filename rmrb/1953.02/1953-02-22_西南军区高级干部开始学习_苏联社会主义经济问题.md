According to the Chongqing XinHua Daily News: The Political Department of the Southwest Military Region issued a notice on January 2nd, stipulating that all cadres at the division level and above in the Southwest Military Region should begin studying Stalin's recent work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" from January 10th, ending in mid-April, for a total of twelve weeks, with eight hours of study per week. Individual cadres at the regimental level with higher cultural and theoretical levels, and who are engaged in theoretical and ideological work, may also participate, but division-level and above cadres whose Chinese language proficiency is below junior high school level should still focus on learning culture and only participate in listening to reports. The notice emphasized: Study must be led by the Party Committee. All those who establish more than two study groups must establish a central study group with the Party Committee as its core to strengthen theoretical guidance in the study. The central study group is also responsible for guiding the study of "Communism and the Communist Party" by cadres in their respective departments, combining their own study with guiding study. The notice also specifically stipulated the study steps and methods. The study steps are divided into three steps, namely, skimming, intensive reading, and review, writing papers or systematically writing study心得[xinde - understandings gained through study]; the study method is to have the Party Committee appoint a special person to make an enlightening report as much as possible, or participate in the report meeting organized by the Provincial Party Committee, and then engage in collective self-study, read documents, and hold group discussions. Discussion meetings must achieve "everyone preparing" in advance, "calling on the spot" at the meeting, and having a dedicated person make a concluding speech.

The responsible comrades of the Military Region Party Committee first established a central study group with the Military Region Party Committee as the core on the afternoon of January 9th and officially began studying. The central study group of the Military Region Party Committee includes nine units including the Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, Cadre Department, Logistics Department, Artillery Force, and Public Security Force, consisting of 31 people including Li Da, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, Wang Xinting, Director of the Political Department, and Li Fuke, Deputy Chief of Staff. Comrade Li Da is the leader, and Comrades Wang Xinting and Li Fuke are the deputy leaders. It is stipulated that in addition to concentrating on studying for three hours every Wednesday afternoon, they will also take time for self-study for two hours, and participate in group study in each unit on Friday afternoon. The central study group of the Military Region Party Committee also established a "study room" to facilitate collective study.

At present, the central study group of the Military Region Party Committee is conducting skimming. After two weeks of skimming, they will spend eight weeks dividing the following four questions for intensive reading and discussion: First, the nature and function of economic laws under the socialist system and the basic economic laws of socialism; second, the problems of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system; third, the problems of preparing for the transition to communism, eliminating the opposition between urban and rural areas, mental and physical labor, and eliminating the differences between them; fourth, the basic economic laws of modern capitalism, the disintegration of the unified world market and the deepening crisis of the world capitalist system, and the inevitable problem of wars between capitalist countries. The establishment and commencement of study by the central study group of the Military Region Party Committee has promoted the study of senior cadres in the entire Southwest Military Region. After the responsible comrades of the nine units participating in the central study group of the Military Region Party Committee returned to their units, they held meetings one after another, and officially established study groups and began studying before January 14th. At the same time, senior cadres from the Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang Military Regions and the Air Force have also been organized to begin studying and have formulated specific plans. The Public Security Force and the Xikang Military Region have established mutual aid groups within the groups. The Yunnan Military Region and the Public Security Force have also formulated study systems and disciplines, and the Air Force Political Department has also formulated a "Weekly Study Progress Registration Form," stipulating that cadres participating in the study fill out one each week to grasp whether they have completed the weekly study progress, what they have learned, and what difficult problems they have encountered. In order to exchange learning experiences and study心得[xinde - understandings gained through study], the Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department has published an irregular "Study Newsletter," and the first issue has now been published.

    西南军区高级干部开始学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    据重庆新华日报讯：西南军区政治部于一月二日发出通知，规定西南全军师级以上干部自一月十日开始学习斯大林近著“苏联社会主义经济问题”，到四月中旬结束，共十二周，每周学习八小时。个别文化理论水平较高、且担任理论思想工作的团级干部亦可参加，但语文程度在初中以下的师级以上干部，仍以学文化为主，只参加听报告。通知中强调指出：学习必须由党委领导，凡成立两个以上学习小组的均必须成立一个以党委为核心的中心学习小组，以加强学习中的理论指导。中心学习小组并有责任指导所在机关干部的“共产主义与共产党”的学习，把自己学习与指导学习结合起来。通知中并具体地规定了学习步骤与学习方法。学习步骤分为三步，即粗读、精读及复习、写论文或系统地写学习心得；学习方法尽可能由党委指定专人作启发报告，或参加省委组织的报告会，然后集体自修，阅读文件，小组讨论。讨论会必须做到事先“人人准备”，会上“临时点将”，并有专人做总结性的发言。
    军区党委负责同志已于一月九日下午首先成立了以军区党委为核心的中心学习小组，正式开始学习。军区党委中心学习小组包括军区司令部、政治部、干部部、后勤部、炮兵部队、公安部队等九个单位，由军区李达副司令员、政治部王新亭主任、李夫克副参谋长等三十一人组成。李达同志为组长，王新亭、李夫克同志为副组长，规定除每周星期三下午集中学习三小时外，另抽时间进行自修两小时，星期五下午则参加各单位小组学习。军区党委中心学习小组为了便于集体学习，还建立了“学习室”。
    目前，军区党委中心学习小组正进行粗读，待两周粗读以后，将以八周时间分下列四个问题进行精读和讨论：第一、关于社会主义制度下经济法则的性质、作用和社会主义的基本经济法则的问题；第二、关于社会主义制度下的商品生产与价值法则的问题；第三、关于准备向共产主义过渡同关于消灭城市和乡村间、脑力劳动和体力劳动间的对立以及关于消灭它们之间的差别的问题；第四、关于现代资本主义的基本经济法则、关于统一的世界市场的瓦解与世界资本主义体系危机加深以及关于资本主义国家间战争不可避免的问题。　军区党委中心学习小组的成立和开始学习，推动了西南全军高级干部的学习。参加军区党委中心学习小组的九个单位的负责同志回到本单位之后，均纷纷召开会议，已于一月十四日以前正式成立了学习小组，开始学习。同时，云南、贵州、四川、西康军区和空军等部高级干部也已组织起来开始学习，并且订出了具体的计划。公安部队和西康军区均在小组内建立了互助组。云南军区和公安部队并制订了学习制度和纪律，空军政治部并制订“每周学习情况登记表”，规定参加学习的干部每周填写一张，以便掌握是否完成本周学习进度，有何心得、体会及有何疑难问题。为了交流学习经验和学习心得，军区政治部宣传部特出版不定期的“学习通讯”，现第一号已经出版。
