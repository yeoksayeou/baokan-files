Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a conference for handling typical cases of anti-bureaucracy, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of law and discipline from January 20th to 25th. Attending the conference were responsible party cadres from the Disciplinary Inspection Committees of the CCP at all levels above the county level throughout the province, the People's Supervision Committees of governments at all levels, the People's Procuratorates, the People's Courts, responsible party cadres in administrative leadership positions from various factories and mining areas, party cadres above the level of department director in provincial-level agencies, and secretaries or deputy secretaries of CCP local committees and municipal committees, totaling 612 people. The conference first seriously dealt with the case of the anti-Party group headed by the Deputy Secretary of the CCP branch in Taidi Village, Yi County, for violating laws and discipline, and the case of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil General Factory, which suffered a fire due to the bureaucracy of leading cadres, resulting in serious losses of state property. Subsequently, in four days of group meetings, in-depth discussions were conducted. Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, gave a concluding report at the conference, calling for launching a deep-going struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of law and discipline throughout the province.

The conference believed that the handling of the above two typical cases was to point out to all Party members, cadres, and people in Hebei Province that in order to defend the interests of the Party, the state, and the people, a resolute struggle must be waged against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Niu Laolian, the former Deputy Secretary of the CCP branch in Taidi Village, Niu Laoyou, the former village chief, and Niu Laoda, the former branch secretary, were all bad elements who had infiltrated the Party. They extorted, blackmailed, raped women, forced people to death, and seized property, completely controlling the organizations of the Party, government, and people's groups in the village as tools for oppressing the masses. Niu Laolian alone raped multiple women. He forcibly occupied a mountain village belonging to Niu Laokuan's wife, forcing the mother and son to become displaced, and their whereabouts are still unknown. Niu Laoyou forcibly occupied the school building and forcibly bought Liu Laocai's horse at a low price. Niu Laoda, in addition to committing crimes himself, threatened the masses with his position as branch secretary, implemented a blockade against investigators, and shielded Niu Laolian's crimes in various ways. The fire incident at the Vegetable Oil General Factory was caused by the serious bureaucracy of the factory's leading cadres. Wu Zhen, the factory director, failed to attach importance to the three consecutive fires in the factory in the past six months. On November 28th of last year, he allowed Wu Chuanjing, the deputy section chief of the production technology section, to violate safety regulations and weld in the workshop, causing the workshop to catch fire, destroying 65 large and small machines, and causing a total loss of 2.6019 billion yuan in state assets. Based on the above situation, the Disciplinary Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP announced at the conference: Niu Laolian and other anti-Party elements will be expelled from the Party and handed over to the People's Government for punishment according to law, and the original Taidi Village Branch Committee will be revoked. The CCP Yi County Tenth District Committee, Yi County Committee, and Baoding Prefectural Committee, which showed serious bureaucracy and one-sidedness in their daily leadership and investigation of this case, were given separate punishments, and the main responsible persons of these organizations made preliminary self-criticisms at the conference. Wu Zhen, the former director of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil General Factory, and Deng Xingwu, the deputy director, who were responsible for the fire incident, have been given punishments such as dismissal by the Provincial People's Government upon the proposal of the Provincial People's Supervision Committee. Wu Zhen and others also made self-criticisms at the conference.

In his concluding report, Lin Tie pointed out: According to the materials exposed and collected during the discussions in the past few days, commandism still exists quite commonly among some grassroots cadres. It has distorted the correct policies of the Party and the government, turning many good things such as organizing labor mutual aid, fighting drought and digging wells, and prize-winning savings into bad things, causing losses to the people. In some district and village cadres, and even individual cadres above the county level, there are still phenomena of violating laws and discipline. The Taidi Village case is an example. These bad people and bad deeds are all related to the bureaucracy of leading cadres of Party and government organizations at all levels. They only assign tasks without explaining policies and methods; they only require numbers, regardless of how the numbers are obtained; they only "complete" tasks for the superiors, regardless of the impact on the masses; they do not understand or examine the situation of grassroots organizations and cadres, and often listen to only one side and believe it, mistaking bad elements for good cadres. Even when problems have been exposed, they are unwilling to deal with them seriously and resolutely, but adopt erroneous practices such as procrastination and cover-ups. Lin Tie said: This kind of bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of law and discipline are reflections of the anti-people style and Kuomintang style of the reactionary rule in our Party and state organs. In order to maintain the purity of our Party and state organs and carry forward the inherent tradition of serving the people wholeheartedly, the Provincial Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the CCP and the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the CCP, has decided to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of law and discipline throughout the province. In carrying out this struggle, all complacency and self-satisfaction, right-leaning thoughts that the struggle "can be carried out or not," "can be slipped through," and the bureaucratic attitude of being careless, as well as the erroneous views that "work is too busy" and fearing that making it too "severe" will lead to "no one daring to work," must be resolutely opposed. In carrying out this movement, attention should also be paid to opposing over-"left" sentiments and practices, and bad people must not be allowed to take advantage of loopholes.

Lin Tie also elaborated in detail on how to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of law and discipline. He particularly emphasized that the key lies in whether criticism and self-criticism can be unfolded, especially criticism from below. Those who suppress criticism are the deadly enemies of the Party, and those who resolutely refuse to turn back after being educated must be expelled from the Party. Lin Tie also clearly stated that carrying out this struggle must be combined with the central work, using the method of "handling typical cases to educate the general," and handling problems in a realistic, responsible manner based on specific circumstances. The specific methods are: (1) Starting with handling letters from the people, organs above the county level should vigorously handle typical cases to educate cadres and the masses, so that the people can dispel their concerns from personal experience and fight against bad people and bad deeds, and so that Party and government organizations at all levels can consciously, actively, and responsibly handle letters and accusations from the people, and further strengthen the ties between the Party, the government, and the people. (2) Organize all cadres above the district level to study and examine themselves. Cadres above the county level should focus on examining bureaucracy that does not care about the suffering of the people, while cadres below the district level should focus on examining commandism and violations of law and discipline. In addition, all industrial and mining enterprises, military, public security, and other departments should also determine the focus of examination based on the situation of their respective departments. (3) Widely promote democracy, and conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. Counties and above can convene people's representative conferences, select typical events, and discuss and handle them through people's representatives, placing cadres and Party members at all levels under the supervision of the people.

    反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪
    中共河北省委处理两个典型案件
    省委书记林铁号召在全省范围内开展这一斗争
    【新华社保定六日电】中国共产党河北省委员会在一月二十日到二十五日召开了反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪典型案件处理大会。参加大会的有全省县以上各级中共党委纪律检查委员会、各级人民政府人民监察委员会、人民检察署、人民法院等部门的负责党员干部，各工厂、矿区党委及负责行政领导职务的党员干部，省级各机关厅长、处长以上党员干部及中共各地委、市委书记或副书记等共六百一十二人。大会首先严肃地处理了易县台底村以中共支部副书记为首的反党集团违法乱纪的案件和石家庄市植物油总厂因领导干部官僚主义致发生失火事故造成国家财产严重损失的案件。接着，在四天的小组会中进行了深刻讨论。中共河北省委员会书记林铁最后在大会上作了总结报告，号召在全省范围内深入开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。
    大会认为上述两个典型案件的处理，就是向河北省全体党员、全体干部和人民指明：为了保卫党、国家和人民的利益，必须向官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪现象作坚决的斗争。中共台底村原支部副书记牛老连和原村长牛老有、原支部书记牛老达等都是混进党内的坏分子。他们敲诈勒索，强奸妇女，逼死人命，谋财霸产，把该村党、政和人民团体的组织完全控制起来，作为他们欺压群众的工具。只牛老连一人就强奸妇女多人。他曾强霸了牛老宽老婆的一座山庄，迫使母子流离失所，至今下落不明。牛老有强占小学校舍，并低价强买刘老才的马匹。牛老达除自身犯罪外，又以支部书记职权威胁群众，对调查人员实行封锁，多方袒护牛老连的罪行。植物油总厂失火事件的造成，是由于该厂领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义。该厂厂长吴振对厂内半年来连续失火三次不予重视，去年十一月二十八日竟又允许生产技术科副科长吴传境违反保安规程到车间烧焊，以致工房着火，烧毁大小机器六十五部，共损失国家资财二十六亿零一百九十多万元。根据上述情况，中共河北省委员会纪律检查委员会在大会上宣布：将牛老连等反党分子开除党籍并交人民政府依法惩办，撤销原台底村支部委员会。对于在日常领导和调查处理此案过程中表现严重官僚主义、偏听偏信的中共易县第十区区委会、易县县委会、保定地委会等，都分别给予处分，这些组织的主要负责人，都在大会上作了初步检讨。石家庄市植物油总厂失火事件的负责人原厂长吴振、副厂长邓兴武等已由省人民监察委员会提议经省人民政府批准，分别给以撤职等处分。吴振等并在大会上作了检讨。
    林铁在总结报告中指出：根据几天讨论所揭发和搜集到的材料，命令主义在某些基层干部中还相当普遍地存在着，它已使党和政府的正确政策被歪曲，把组织劳动互助、抗旱打井、有奖储蓄等许多好事都办成了坏事，造成人民的损失。在部分区村干部甚至县以上个别干部中，还存在着违法乱纪的现象。台底村案件就是一个例子。这些坏人坏事，都是和各级党、政组织领导干部的官僚主义相关联的。他们只交代任务，不交代政策、方法；只要求数字，不管数字怎样来；只对上级“完成”任务，不管对群众的影响；他们不了解、不审查基层组织和干部的情况，往往偏听偏信，把坏分子误认为好干部。甚至问题已经被揭发，还不肯认真坚决处理，而采取拖拉、包庇等错误作法。林铁说：这种官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的情况，是反动统治的反人民作风、国民党作风在我们党和国家机关内的反映。为了保持我们党和国家机关的纯洁，发扬固有的全心全意为人民服务的传统，因此，省委会根据中共中央和中共中央华北局的指示，决定在全省范围内开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争。在开展这一斗争中，一切麻痹自满，认为斗争“可搞可不搞”、“可以滑过去”的右倾思想、马马虎虎的官僚主义态度，以及认为“工作太忙”，怕搞得太“厉害”了“没人敢工作”等等错误观点，必须坚决反对。开展这一运动，还要注意反对过“左”的情绪和作法，不能让坏人钻空子。
    林铁对于怎样开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争也作了详细的阐述。他特别强调指出：关键在于能不能展开批评与自我批评，尤其是自下而上的批评。压制批评的人就是党的死敌，经教育而坚决不肯回头者，必须开除党籍。林铁并明确提出：开展这次斗争必须结合中心工作进行，用“典型处理，教育一般”的方法，根据具体情况，实事求是，认真负责地处理问题。具体办法是：（一）从处理人民群众来信入手，县以上机关应大张旗鼓地处理典型案件，以教育干部与群众，使人民群众从切身体验中解除顾虑，向坏人坏事进行斗争，使各级党、政组织能够自觉主动地、积极负责地处理人民群众的来信和控告，进一步密切党、政府和人民群众的联系。（二）组织区以上全体干部进行学习与检查。县以上干部以检查不关心人民疾苦的官僚主义为重点，区以下干部以检查命令主义、违法乱纪为重点。此外，各工矿、企业、军事、公安等部门，也都要根据本部门情况确定检查重点。（三）广泛发扬民主，认真开展批评与自我批评，尤其是自下而上的批评。县以上可召开人民代表会议，选择典型事件，通过人民代表讨论处理，把各级干部和党员放在人民监督之下。
