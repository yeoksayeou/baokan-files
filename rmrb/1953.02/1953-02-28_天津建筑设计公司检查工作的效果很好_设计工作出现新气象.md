Tianjin Architectural Design Company's Inspection Work Yields Good Results
Design Work Shows New Vigor

[This newspaper report] Tianjin Architectural Design Company, under the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering, has achieved good results after mobilizing all designers to inspect the design projects of 1952, with significant improvements in design work.

The inspection work first achieved good results in criticizing erroneous design ideologies. The Tianjin Architectural Design Company was established after the "Five-Anti" campaign last year. Most of the technical personnel had worked in private architectural firms for a long time, and their bourgeois design ideas and technical viewpoints were very strong. They looked down upon design work for factories and warehouses. They believed that the main effort of architectural engineers should be put on architectural formulas, and in-depth on-site investigation and research were unnecessary. Even in the case of Engineer Deng Wanxiong's design of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China, the material list included Belgian figured glass, Italian marble, American steel bars, and Philippine wood, etc. In the past, the technical personnel's erroneous design ideas caused many irreparable major losses in their work, but they have not been effectively criticized and corrected. The Architectural Design Company has also carried out several ideological reform movements, but because they were not closely integrated with specific work, they never deeply touched upon and solved the main ideological problem in the work – backward and conservative design thinking. With the task of basic construction in 1953 becoming increasingly imminent, the solution of this problem became more and more urgent. The leadership of the Architectural Design Company decided to use the winter slack season to conduct a mass democratic inspection of design projects, and to launch a struggle between new and old ideas through the inspection. Because this inspection thoroughly implemented the mass line from beginning to end, not only mobilizing all internal designers, but also mobilizing the masses who use the buildings to participate, and moving the inspection work from the office to the site, all designers received a profound education. In the past, architectural engineers had never gone to the site to inspect their work, especially to ask the masses for advice. So at that time, many engineers could not understand it, thinking that "no problems can be found on the site" and "the masses are laymen and will not put forward any good opinions." But the facts quickly corrected their views. Going to the construction site, there were problems everywhere. As soon as they entered the flour mill, they saw many holes drilled in the new reinforced concrete floor, with countless cracks appearing around them. Only after asking did they find out that the holes for the machine belts were not left when designing, and now they had to poke through the floor. On the site, the masses became the best teachers of the inspection team. With the active participation of the masses, the inspection teams found hundreds of problems. When inspecting the textile hospital project, the inspection team held five separate symposiums for doctors, nurses, patients, workers, and medical administrative personnel. Many problems that engineers had never thought of were brought up at the meeting without omission by the masses. A nurse said that steps were designed at the entrance of the emergency room and the main entrance of the hospital, which you think are beautiful, but they increase the suffering of patients. If the steps are designed as ramps, patients can be pushed in and out in a wheelchair. A worker who manages the incinerator said that you set the morgue next to the incinerator room. The morgue is as hot as fire all day long. How can bodies be stored in the summer? The inspection of the Liulitai dormitory of the People's Bank of China revealed a design error that wasted 3.7 billion yuan; a single "eave" cost 1.8 billion yuan. The fact that such a large amount of waste was caused by design errors shocked everyone, and everyone felt surprised and heartbroken. Most people thus saw the harm of conservative and backward bourgeois design ideas and initially corrected their work attitude.

The effect of the inspection work is also reflected in the promotion of advanced technical experience, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the past, the Tianjin Architectural Design Company also called for learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in its work, and the staff also created advanced working methods such as "semi-circular wooden small frame," but they were stubbornly resisted by conservative ideas and were not promoted. This inspection work was closely combined with the promotion of advanced experience, so through on-site inspection and summary, five advanced technologies were finally affirmed. These are: the Soviet advanced experience "brick lintel," the Soviet Ivanyan Plastic Theory structural calculation method, the use of wooden tenons, prefabricated cement floor slabs, and the "small frame" working method. These five advanced technologies are all very valuable. For example, for a workshop in the casting factory of the Demonstration Machine Factory, calculated according to the Ivanyan structure calculation method, 13 tons of steel bars can be saved compared with the old British and American calculation methods. During this inspection, the leadership of the Architectural Design Company designated two groups to specifically summarize the above five advanced technologies. In the past, the People's Insurance Company Auditorium adopted the Soviet Union's advanced experience "brick lintel" in its design ("lintel" is a horizontal beam used to support the weight of the brick wall above the doors and windows; the old method was made of wood or concrete, and the Soviet method used bricks instead). At that time, the adoption of this advanced technology was opposed by many people. This time, the staff of the inspection team climbed to all the doors and windows to check in detail, and the results proved that the "brick lintel" was very strong and durable. At the same time, the inspection team held a symposium for construction workers, who listed many advantages of "brick lintels," such as that the "brick lintel" can be constructed immediately after it is built, which does not delay work and shortens the construction period; concrete lintels need to wait for them to solidify before construction can begin. The staff of the inspection team also precisely calculated the cost of the two types of lintels, and the result was that each meter of "brick lintel" saved 27% of the investment compared to concrete lintels. The other advanced experiences were also thoroughly checked, compared, and studied in many aspects, which fully proved their absolute superiority. The Architectural Design Company has decided to widely promote and apply them in this year's design work. This victory in affirming and promoting advanced experience heavily struck conservative and backward ideas. All designers further realized the importance of learning advanced Soviet technology and learning new things.

The effect of the inspection work has been consolidated and developed after summarizing, which has made significant improvements in the design work. After returning from the on-site inspection, the Tianjin Architectural Design Company first organized each inspection team to fully conduct democratic discussions based on the inspection materials, summarized the experiences gained from the inspection, made it more systematic and organized, and printed these materials as teaching materials for improving this year's design work. At the same time, the leadership of the Architectural Design Company further carried out ideological education work for the technical personnel. After the inspection, some technical personnel, seeing the serious errors in their past work, developed a lack of confidence. The leadership of the Architectural Design Company invited Engineer Yu Fujing, who had returned from visiting the flax mill in Harbin, to give a report, introducing the advanced design ideas of Soviet experts in the design work of the flax mill, and providing a concrete learning example for everyone. At this time, the Architectural Design Company conducted another work to evaluate outstanding workers, rewarding and commending technical personnel who had modestly learned advanced Soviet technology and actively improved technology and achieved certain results. This greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm and research spirit of the technical personnel.

Now, all the technical personnel are enthusiastically re-examining and modifying the thirty-six design projects spanning the year that have not yet been constructed or are under construction, trying various methods to make up for the losses. For example, the Baijiu Factory was so careless and sloppy in its past design work that 30,000 gallons of wastewater could not be discharged every day, and now Engineer Luan Quanxun and others have redesigned an underground drainage project. In the past, some bases were not explored, and reeds were found underground, and now they are re-surveyed. At the same time, the technical personnel revised and improved the various design work systems, such as design procedures, business procedures, design entrustment forms, technical design responsibility systems, and review responsibility systems, all of which were clearly stipulated. Many errors in the past design work were greatly related to the unsound work system and unclear responsibilities. For example, in the past, there was no design entrustment form when designing. Engineers did not meet with the owners. The surveying and mapping team went to the base to look at the terrain and topography and started designing hastily. The business procedures formulated this time particularly emphasized the investigation and research work before design, stipulating that the owner must have an "approved project proposal" approved by the higher authorities, must first fill in the building cost and land ownership certificate, etc. on the design entrustment form, and must provide sufficient information on the use of the building and original reference materials. Then, based on these original materials, the surveying and mapping department will conduct a preliminary survey of the base, and the personnel responsible for the design will need to further investigate and understand the design reference materials before proceeding with the preliminary design. The technical design will be carried out after the preliminary design is approved by the owner and approved by the higher authorities. After the technical design is approved by the owner and approved by the higher authorities, the construction drawings and explanations will be drawn. Before construction, during construction, and after the completion of the project, the verification work is emphasized. In addition to the verifiers, the personnel responsible for the design must also go to the construction site for key verification to solve technical problems in a timely manner. For another example, a better system has also been established for reviewing designs this time. The past review responsibility system was a three-level review system of mutual review by employees in the group, review by the group leader, and review by the team leader, but the specific review responsibilities were not clearly stipulated, and in fact it became a state of "three reviews and three non-reviews" with no one responsible. The review responsibility system formulated this time stipulates the specific review items for trainees, technicians, engineers, etc., and the responsibilities are very clear. Through this inspection, we also learned the lessons from many serious errors caused by neglecting surveying and exploration work in the past. The Architectural Design Company has expanded the surveying and mapping team into a surveying and exploration department, with four groups: topography, building status, drilling, and testing; the staff has also increased from the original seventeen to seventy-eight. In addition, the Tianjin Architectural Design Company has also modified the past construction instructions and selected standard drawings based on the advanced operating methods of construction workers.

    天津建筑设计公司检查工作的效果很好
    设计工作出现新气象
    【本报讯】天津市建筑工程局所属建筑设计公司动员全体设计人员对一九五二年设计工程进行检查后，收到很好的效果，设计工作有了较显著的改进。
    检查工作首先在批判错误的设计思想方面，收到了很好的效果。天津建筑设计公司是在去年“五反”后成立的。大部分技术人员过去长期在私营建筑师事务所工作，资产阶级的设计思想和技术观点十分浓厚。他们轻视工厂、仓库一类的设计工作。他们认为建筑工程师的主要力量应放在建筑公式上面，深入工地调查研究是不必要的。甚至如工程师邓万雄设计人民银行天津分行大楼时，提出的材料单上面就有比利时的麻花玻璃、意大利的大理石、美国的钢筋、菲律宾的木头等等。技术人员的错误设计思想，过去在工作中造成了许多无法挽回的重大损失，但是，一直没有得到有力的批判和纠正。建筑设计公司也曾连续进行了几次思想改造运动，由于没有和具体工作紧密地结合起来，始终没有较深地触及到并解决这个工作中的主要思想问题——落后和保守的设计思想。一九五三年基本建设的任务愈来愈近，这个问题的解决也愈来愈迫切。建筑设计公司领导方面便决定利用冬闲空隙进行一次群众性的对设计工程的民主检查，从检查中来展开新旧思想的斗争。因为这次检查自始至终充分贯彻了走群众路线的方针，不仅发动了内部的全体设计人员，而且也发动了使用建筑物的群众来参加，并把检查工作从室内移到了现场，使所有设计人员都受到了深刻的教育。过去，建筑工程师到现场去检查自己的工作，特别是去向群众请教，是从来没有过的。所以当时许多工程师想不通，认为“现场上不会检查出什么问题”，“群众是外行，不会提出什么好意见”。但是事实迅速纠正了他们的看法。到建筑地点一看，到处都是问题。一走进面粉厂粉楼，迎面就看见钢筋混凝土的新楼板上凿了许多个窟窿，四周出现无数裂纹。一问才知道设计的时候没有留下穿机器皮带的空洞，现在只好把楼板戳通。在现场，群众成了检查组最好的老师。在群众积极参加下，各检查组查出数以百计的问题。在检查纺织医院工程时，检查组分别召开了大夫、护士、病员、工友、医政人员等五个座谈会，许多工程师从来没有想到过的问题，群众一点不漏地在会上提了出来。一个护士说，在急诊室门口和医院大门口设计了台阶，你们觉得蛮好看，病人却增加不少的痛苦。如果把台阶设计成坡道，病人就可以坐在车上推着进出。一个管理焚炉的工人说，你们把太平间设在焚炉房隔壁，太平间整天热得像火烧，夏天怎么能停放尸体呢？人民银行六里台宿舍检查出了浪费三十七亿元的设计错误，光一个“挑檐”就化了十八亿元。这种因设计错误而造成大量浪费的事实，使得人人震动起来，人人感到吃惊和痛心。大部分人从而看清了保守的落后的资产阶级设计思想的危害性，初步端正了工作态度。
    检查工作的效果还表现在推广先进技术经验，特别是苏联先进经验的方面。过去天津建筑设计公司在工作中也曾号召学习苏联的先进经验，工作人员也曾创造了“半圆木小房架”等先进工作法，但是都遭到了保守思想顽固的抗拒而没有得到推广。这次检查工作与推广先进经验密切地结合了起来，因而通过实地检查总结，终于肯定了五项先进技术。这就是：苏联先进经验“砖过梁”、苏联依维扬斯基塑性理论结构计算法、木钉榫使用法、预制洋灰楼板、“小房架”工作法。这五项先进技术都是很有价值的。例如示范机器厂铸铁厂一间厂房，依据依维扬斯基结构计算法来计算，就可比英美旧的计算方法节省十三吨钢筋。这次检查时，建筑设计公司领导方面曾指定两个小组专门总结上述五项先进技术。人民保险公司礼堂过去在设计时曾采用了苏联的先进经验“砖过梁”（“过梁”是用来支持门窗上面砖墙重量的一根横梁，旧做法是用木料或混凝土制成的，苏联的方法则用砖来代替），当时在采用这一先进技术时曾受到许多人的反对。这次检查组的工作人员爬到所有门窗上去详细检查，结果证明“砖过梁”十分坚固耐用。同时，检查组又召开了施工人员座谈会，施工人员列举了“砖过梁”的许多优点，如“砖过梁”砌好后即可继续施工，既不窝工，又可缩短工期；用混凝土过梁需要等它凝结后才能施工。检查组工作人员又精密地计算了二种过梁的造价，结果是每公尺“砖过梁”比混凝土过梁节约百分之二十七的投资。其余几项先进经验也都一一经过多方面的检查、对比和研究，完全证明了它们绝对的优越性。建筑设计公司已决定在今年的设计工作中普遍推广应用。这一肯定和推广先进经验的胜利，就重重打击了保守落后思想。全体设计人员进一步认识了学习苏联先进技术、学习新鲜事物的重要性。
    检查工作的效果，经过总结得到了巩固和发展，使得设计工作有了较显著的改进。从实地检查回来后，天津建筑设计公司首先组织各检查小组根据检查材料充分进行了民主的讨论，总结了检查所得的经验，使之更系统化和条理化了，并把这些材料整理付印，作为改进今年设计工作的教材。同时，建筑设计公司领导方面对技术人员进一步进行了思想教育工作。检查以后，一部分技术人员因为看到过去工作中的严重错误，产生了信心不足的情绪。建筑设计公司领导方面就请从哈尔滨参观亚麻厂回来的工程师虞福京做了一个报告，介绍亚麻厂设计工作中苏联专家的先进设计思想，为大家提供了一个具体的学习榜样。这时，建筑设计公司又进行了一次评选优秀工作者的工作，奖励和表扬虚心学习苏联先进技术、积极改进技术获得一定成绩的技术人员。这就大大地鼓舞了技术人员的工作积极性和钻研精神。
    现在，全体技术人员热情高涨地重新审查和修改跨年度的尚未施工或正在施工的三十六件设计工程，想各种办法来挽回损失。如白酒厂因过去设计工作马虎草率，以致每天有三万加伦废水无法排泄，现在工程师銮全训等已重新设计了一个地下排水的工程。过去有些基地未经钻探，地底下发现了芦苇，现在也重新进行勘测工作。与此同时，技术人员又修订和健全了各项设计工作制度，如设计程序、业务程序、设计委托书、技术设计责任制和审核责任制等，都做了明确的规定。过去设计工作中的许多错误，与工作制度不健全、职责不分明有很大关系。如过去设计时，没有设计委托书，工程师不和业主见面，测绘组到基地去看一下地形、地势，就草草开始设计。这次制订的业务程序，特别强调了设计前的调查研究工作，规定业主必须具备上级批准的“计划任务书”，必须先在设计委托书上填写建筑物造价及地权所有证明等，并须供给足够的建筑物使用情况及原始参考资料。然后，根据这些原始资料，由勘测科到基地进行初步勘测，负责设计的人员还需进一步调查了解设计参考资料，才
    进行初步设计。初步设计经业主同意和上级批准后，再进行二次勘测，才进行技术设计。技术设计经业主同意和上级批准后，才绘制施工图说。在施工前、施工过程中及工程完竣后，并强调查验工作，除查验员外，负责设计的人员也必须下工地重点查验，及时解决技术问题。又如，审核设计，这次也订出了较好的制度。过去的审核责任制是组内员工互相审、小组长审和大组长审的三审制度，但没有明确规定具体审核的责任，实际上成了“三审三不审”的无人负责状况。这次制订的审核责任制度规定了练习生、技术员、工程师等的具体审核项目，责任非常明确。通过这次检查，也吸取了过去由于忽视勘测钻探工作所造成的许多严重错误的教训。建筑设计公司已把测绘组扩大为勘测科，分设地形、建筑物现状、钻探、化验等四组；工作人员也由原来的十七人增加到七十八人。此外，天津建筑设计公司还根据建筑工人的先进操作法，修改了过去的施工说明书及挑选标准图说。
