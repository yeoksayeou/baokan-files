    Israeli Authorities Condone Mob Bombing of Soviet Embassy in Israel
    Soviet Union Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with Israel
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 15th] TASS, Moscow: The Soviet government sent a note to the Israeli government on the 11th, declaring the severance of diplomatic relations with the Israeli government. The contents of the note are as follows:

    "On February 9th, a group of thugs, clearly with the tacit consent of the police, carried out a bomb explosion at the premises of the Soviet Embassy in Israel, resulting in injuries to the wife of the Minister K.V. Yerofeyev, the wife of the embassy staff member A.P. Sisoev, and embassy staff member Grishin. Part of the Soviet embassy building was destroyed.

    On February 10th, the President of Israel and the Israeli Foreign Ministry sent letters to the Soviet Embassy, respectively, expressing apologies for the aforementioned crime, while declaring that the Israeli government condemns this criminal act and is taking measures to search for and punish the perpetrators.

    However, in view of the well-known and undeniable fact that representatives of the Israeli ruling party are involved in the planned incitement of hatred and hostility towards the Soviet Union and encouragement of hostile actions against the Soviet Union; therefore, the statements and apologies made by the Israeli government regarding the terrorist act against the Soviet Embassy premises on February 9th are clearly a hypocritical act, the purpose of which is to cover up traces of the crime committed against the Soviet Union and to evade the Israeli government's responsibility for this crime.

    Not only do the articles published in the newspapers of the Israeli ruling party have a provocative nature; moreover, the speeches made in parliament by representatives of these parties and officials of the Israeli government are also provocative in nature, especially the speech made by Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett on January 19th of this year, in which he openly incited hostile actions against the Soviet Union.
        The terrorist act that occurred on February 9th proves that the basic conditions for Soviet representatives to conduct normal diplomatic activities in Israel do not exist.

    In view of the foregoing, the Soviet government hereby recalls the Soviet Minister to Israel and the staff of the Soviet Embassy, and severs relations with the Israeli government.

    The Soviet government also declares that it is no longer possible for the Israeli Embassy to continue to reside in Moscow, and therefore demands that the staff of the embassy leave the Soviet Union immediately."

### 以色列当局默许暴徒炸毁苏驻以使馆  苏联宣布断绝苏以外交关系

    以色列当局默许暴徒炸毁苏驻以使馆
    苏联宣布断绝苏以外交关系
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在十一日以照会一件送给以色列政府，声明与以色列政府断绝外交关系。照会内容如下：
    “二月九日，一群暴徒显然得到警察的默许，曾在苏联驻以色列公使馆馆舍制造了一次炸弹爆炸的事件，结果炸伤公使克·维·叶尔绍夫的夫人、公使馆职员阿·普·西索耶夫的夫人和公使馆职员格里辛。苏联公使馆房屋被炸毁一部分。
    二月十日，以色列总统和以色列外交部曾分别写信给苏联公使馆，对于上述的罪行表示歉意，同时声明以色列政府谴责这个罪恶行动，并在采取措施以搜捕和惩办罪犯。
    然而，鉴于以色列政府代表参与有计划地煽动对苏联的仇恨和敌意以及鼓励对苏联采取敌对行动，已是众所周知而且不容置辩的事实；因此，以色列政府就二月九日对苏联公使馆馆舍的恐怖行动所作的声明和道歉，很显明地是一种虚伪的行为，其目的在于掩盖对苏联所犯罪行的痕迹和推卸以色列政府对这个罪行所负的责任。
    不但以色列执政党报纸上所发表的文章带有挑衅的性质；而且，这些政党的代表和以色列政府的官员在议会中所发表的演说也带有挑衅的性质，外交部部长摩西·夏里特今年一月十九日的演说尤其是这样，他曾公开煽动对苏联采取敌对行动。
        二月九日所发生的恐怖行动，证明苏联代表在以色列没有进行正常外交活动的基本条件。
    苏联政府鉴于上述各节，特召回苏联驻以色列公使和苏联公使馆的人员，并且和以色列政府断绝关系。
    苏联政府同时声明，以色列公使馆继续驻在莫斯科已经不可能，因此要求该公使馆人员立刻离开苏联。”
