In Promoting the Abundant Harvest Experience of Zhaoyuan County, Cadres of Hailun County Committed a Serious Mistake of Formalism

According to a letter from our correspondent Li Gui, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, committed a serious mistake of formalism in promoting the abundant harvest experience of Zhaoyuan. The letter states: I arrived in Hailun County on January 8th. On that day, I talked with the comrades of the Hailun County Party Committee about some issues concerning the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. Comrade Qiu Jian, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, said: "The county attaches importance to the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, and the county committee leadership has also paid attention to it. The Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience has been implemented in all meetings, regardless of size. It is still difficult to say which district is doing well or badly in promoting it; generally, they are all about the same."

The next day, I went to the Seventeenth District of Hailun County, just in time for the district to hold a meeting of village cadres to convey the spirit of the County Party Committee meeting and to arrange the next steps. The meeting began with Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head, conveying the spirit of the County Party Committee meeting, mainly talking about three issues: mutual aid and cooperation, promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, grain purchase, and public grain. He spoke for more than two hours. Then, the village cadres had a discussion. They mainly talked about how to complete the public grain and grain purchase work and other issues; no one mentioned the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. The next morning, Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head, organized everyone to study the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. The method of study was for Comrade Qu Hongbin, the district health assistant, to read aloud the article "We Should Pay Attention to the New Experience of Zhaoyuan County's Patriotic Agricultural Production Increase Movement This Year" written by Zhao Dezun, the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. This article was more than five thousand words long, and he read it all in fifteen minutes without explaining the important points. In particular, when reading the section on "The Main Problems and Main Methods of Increasing Agricultural Production in Heilongjiang Province," he read it even more sloppily. For example, when reading about the reasons for the decline in production in Heilongjiang Province, Comrade Qu Hongbin read it like this: "Secretary Zhao said that the reason for our province's decline in production is this, that, all sorts of reasons, which resulted in less grain being harvested." After reading it like this, not only did no one understand it, but they couldn't even remember the general meaning. At that time, Comrade Cao Yongheng, a district cadre, said to everyone: "Let's discuss it, how to publicize it when we go back to the village?" No one said anything. Thus, it became like "putting a pot on the stove" - everyone was silent. Everyone lowered their heads and remained silent for a long time. Zhao Changfu, the secretary of the Lucun Village branch, spoke up: "Our village hasn't even started promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, and no one even recognizes this experience. Who are we going to get to publicize it?" Xie Yongcheng from Shuangxing Village said: "They keep saying how good the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience is, but what exactly is good about it? I don't understand!" Then two or three other people spoke. Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head, then said: "You have studied the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience and have gained some initial results. Each village should now report the amount of land being promoted!" At that time, there was again complete silence. Everyone looked at each other, staring blankly. Then someone answered: "Let's estimate!" The people sitting in the back said: "Let's just guess!" Some said: "Our village will plant 80 *qiang* with wide rows." Others said: "100 *qiang*." In a short time, they reported 1,830 *qiang* of land planted with wide rows, 1,975 *qiang* of land with topdressing fertilizer, and 653 *qiang* of wheat planted with flat sowing. Some village cadres said behind their backs: "This is just nonsense!" In the afternoon, Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head, gave a summary again. He began by saying: "Everyone has gained a lot from this meeting; in particular, we have studied the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience at this meeting. When we return to the village, we must repeatedly publicize it to the masses and resolutely implement it among the masses. Anyone who does not publicize it well will be criticized and punished." Then he talked about mutual aid and cooperation, agricultural production, public grain purchase, and other work (such as agricultural loans, charity granary grain, etc.), speaking for another two hours, without mentioning the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience again. The meeting ended like this.

That evening, I talked with seven district cadres about promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. I asked Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head, why he didn't explain the Zhaoyuan experience clearly to everyone at the meeting today. He said: "I just don't have enough knowledge. I don't thoroughly understand the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience either. What can I say?" Comrade Zhou Qi said: "We haven't studied the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience! When I worked in Jubao Mountain Village, the masses asked me: Why are the soybeans growing tall and climbing vines but not forming pods? I didn't understand, so I could only say: It's related to applying less manure, planting late, and bad seeds. At that time, the masses sarcastically said: The cow's tail root is top-dressed all year round, but why doesn't it grow crops? ... This is precisely because I don't understand the technology that I ran into this problem."

The formalism mistake made by the Seventeenth District of Hailun County in promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience is inseparable from the generalized leadership style of the county cadres. Comrade Cao Yongjin, the Deputy District Head of the Seventeenth District, said: "I have attended several meetings in the county, and I have only heard about how important the Zhaoyuan experience is, but I haven't learned anything else." According to statistics, the county has held three district head meetings, one agricultural production cooperative meeting, two village cadre training classes, and two technician training classes, with a total of more than 2,000 people participating. Although the county committee leadership has "publicized" the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience at these meetings, it has not actually implemented it. There are still many cadres who do not understand what the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience is all about. They seem to have done a lot of work in promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, but why is the actual effect not great? Just as Comrade Qiu Jian, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, himself said: "Our county's past methods of promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience were not correct. The county only generally called for it at meetings, only saying how important it is to promote the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, without going deep into reality and without specific leadership."

Now, the leadership of Hailun County has begun to recognize the seriousness of this problem and is actively correcting this formalistic style.

### 在推广肇源县丰产经验中  海伦县干部犯了严重的形式主义的毛病

    在推广肇源县丰产经验中
    海伦县干部犯了严重的形式主义的毛病
    据本报通讯员李贵来信说，黑龙江省海伦县在推广肇源丰产经验中犯了严重的形式主义的毛病。来信中说：我一月八日到了海伦县，当天和中共海伦县委的同志们谈到了推广肇源丰产经验的一些问题。县委书记邱建同志讲：“县里是重视推广肇源丰产经验的，县委领导方面也注意了，无论大小会议上都贯彻了肇源丰产经验；现在还很难说那个区推广得好坏，一般的都差不多。”
    我在第二天到了海伦县第十七区，正赶上区里召开村干部会议，传达县委会议精神和布置下一步工作。会议开始由副区长曹永金同志传达县委会议精神，主要讲了互助合作、推广肇源丰产经验、购粮和公粮等三个问题，一讲就讲了两个多钟头。接着，村干部们就进行了座谈。他们主要讲了一下怎样完成公粮和购粮工作和其他一些问题，谁也没有提到肇源丰产经验这个事。第二天早晨，副区长曹永金同志就组织大家学习肇源丰产经验。学习方法是由区卫生助理员曲洪斌同志给大家念省委书记赵德尊同志写的“我们应当重视肇源县今年农业爱国增产运动的新经验”。这篇文章一共有五千来字，他一气十五分钟就念完了，重要地方也没有加以解释；特别是念到“黑龙江省农业增产的主要问题和主要方法”的一段，念得更潦草。比如念到黑龙江省减产的原因时，曲洪斌同志是这样给念的：“赵书记说，咱们省减产的原因就是这个，那个，乱七八糟的原因，就少打粮了。”这样念了以后，不但谁也没听懂，连个大概意思也记不住。那时，区干部曹永恒同志就向大家说：“咱们讨论一下吧，回村怎样宣传？”大家谁也不吱声。于是，成了“插锅干饭”——闷起来了。大家把脑袋低下，闷了有好大工夫，禄中村支部书记赵长富说话了：“我们村别说推广肇源丰产经验，连一个认识这经验的都没有，叫谁宣传呢？”双兴村谢永成说：“光说肇源丰产经验这么好，那么好，可是到底好在哪儿？我不明白啊！”接着又有两三个人发了言，副区长曹永金同志就说：“你们学习了肇源丰产经验，也有了初步的收获，各村就报一下推广的数目吧！”当时又鸦雀无声了。你瞅我，我瞅你，大眼瞅小眼地闷了一气。这时就有人答话：“估计吧！”在后边坐着的人说：“简直就蒙着说吧！”有的说：“我们村宽播八十垧。”有的说：“一百垧。”不大一气的工夫，就报了宽播一千八百三十垧、追肥一千九百七十五垧、平播麦子六百五十三垧。有的村干部在背后说：“这才是瞎扯蛋呢！”到下午，又由副区长曹永金同志作总结。他开头就说：“这次咱们开的会，大家都有很大的收获；特别是咱们在这次会上学习了肇源丰产经验，回村要反复向群众宣传，要坚决贯彻到群众中去。谁要宣传不好，就要受到批评和处分。”接着他又分互助合作、农业生产、公粮购粮，以及其他工作（像农业贷款，义仓粮等）几大问题讲起来，一讲又是两个多钟头，也没有再提肇源丰产经验的事。会议就这样开完了。
    当天晚间，我又和七个区干部谈了推广肇源丰产经验的事。我问副区长曹永金同志今天开会时为什么不把肇源经验给大家讲清楚，他说：“就是肚子没有油水，我对肇源丰产经验也不彻底懂，讲啥呀！”周岐同志说：“我们也没学习肇源丰产经验啊！我到聚宝山村工作，群众问我：大豆长得高、爬秧子不结角是咋回事？我不懂，就只好说：和上粪少、种得晚、种籽不好都有关系。当时群众讽刺地说：牛尾巴根子成年追肥，可是不长庄稼是啥道理？……这正是因为自己不懂技术，才碰了这个钉子。”
    海伦县第十七区推广肇源丰产经验犯了形式主义的毛病，和县干部领导作风的一般化是分不开的。十七区副区长曹永金同志说：“到县里开过几次会，也只是听讲肇源经验如何如何重要，别的啥也没学到。”据统计，全县开过三次区长会议，一次农业生产合作社会议，两次村干部训练班，两次技术员训练班，总共有两千多人参加。县委领导方面在这几次会议上虽然都“宣传”了肇源丰产经验，可是却没有实际贯彻下去，现在还有很多干部不懂得肇源丰产经验是怎么回事。他们对于推广肇源丰产经验也似乎做了很多的工作，可是为什么实际效果不大呢？正像县委书记邱建同志自己所说的：“我们县过去推广肇源丰产经验的方法是不对头的，县上光在会上一般地号召，光说推广肇源丰产经验如何如何重要，而不深入实际，没有具体领导。”
    现在海伦县领导方面已开始认识了这个问题的严重性，正在积极纠正这种形式主义的作风。
