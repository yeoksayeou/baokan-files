    The Fifth Anniversary of the Czechoslovak People's Victory Day
    By Czechoslovak Writer Jan Drda
    Today, the people of Czechoslovakia celebrate the fifth anniversary of the events of February 25, 1948, with boundless excitement and pride. This day, following the glorious liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army on May 9, 1945, is another great holiday for the Republic and the most glorious and splendid page in our new history.
    If the liberation of Czechoslovakia on May 9, 1945 – the unforgettable grace of Stalin – made the people of our country the true masters of their homeland, then the great victory of the people over the reactionaries on February 25, 1948, provided a strong guarantee for building socialism in our country and thoroughly shattered the regime held by the American imperialist running dogs – the traitorous bourgeoisie – saving our country from repeating a more shameful Munich-like disaster: the trap carefully set for the Czechoslovak people by the imperialist bandits.
    Even during Hitler's occupation, when the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, were waging an arduous and heroic struggle against fascism and defending national independence, a small group of bourgeois elements gathered around Beneš, traitors sheltered in London, harbored malicious intentions, preparing to seize power through sinister conspiracies after the collapse of the Hitlerite fascist gang, so that Czechoslovakia would once again suffer the ravages of British and American imperialism. However, the victorious advance of Stalin's army liberated Europe and also brought freedom to the Czechoslovak people, making our working people have unparalleled trust and love for the Czechoslovak Communist Party and its wise leader, Comrade Gottwald, thus enabling our working people to resolutely assume the responsibility of leadership after the liberation of the motherland. The Czechoslovak Communist Party occupied an important position in national affairs and became the strongest pillar in the Czech and Slovak National Front. The bourgeois reactionaries, led by the conspirator and imperialist broker Beneš, who then occupied the position of President of the Czechoslovak Republic and directly obeyed imperialism, set themselves a series of tasks: to trap the people, confuse public opinion, undermine the people's ideals for a new life, remove the Communist Party, which was supported by the people, from its leading position, destroy the loyal alliance between the Czechoslovak people and the Soviet Union, and thereby put Czechoslovakia under the yoke of imperialism for enslavement and slaughter.
    The reactionaries had long been scheming anti-people activities. They nominally accepted the basic principles announced in the Košice Government Program formulated in April 1945: nationalization of industry; land ownership for laboring peasants; punishment of traitors and fascist elements; and the establishment of a genuine people's regime united in the National Committee. But in fact, they engaged in another set of activities, specifically engaged in undermining these progressive principles. In the second half of 1947, the traitors seized the opportunity to launch a conspiracy to attack the people. In that year, Czechoslovakia suffered a severe drought, and the crops in the fields were almost completely dried up. The people's food problem faced a disastrous threat. At that time, Prime Minister Gottwald consulted with the Soviet Union and requested assistance. Comrade Stalin immediately provided direct support and supplied Czechoslovakia with a large amount of grain. In this way, the Czechoslovak people were saved from this disaster of starvation.
    The reactionaries' trick was to install their own agent, Beneš, in the presidential position, and use his presidential powers to influence national affairs, so as to isolate Gottwald and the Communist Party, and gradually squeeze the Communist Party out of the government. They wanted to use this despicable means to seize power. At the same time, they used fascist elements lurking in the army and state public security organs to conspire to hold armed riots, collect weapons, and formulate a plan to occupy the Prague radio station and arm a fascist combat force. In short, their conspiracy was extremely vicious and insidious. They received full help and behind-the-scenes instructions from imperialism. However, they forgot two things: first, the Communist Party under the leadership of Gottwald had a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and determination; second, the Czechoslovak working people were ready to sacrifice everything to defend the fruits of victory won by the Soviet Army's liberation of Czechoslovakia.
    On February 20, 1948, the criminals took action. Twelve bourgeois ministers and two state secretaries announced their resignations and submitted their resignation statements to Gottwald, the Prime Minister at the time, attempting to coerce Gottwald into giving up his position as Prime Minister. But they were completely wrong. Comrade Gottwald was neither a shopkeeper nor a coward. He was a true revolutionary leader of the people, an excellent student of Stalin, an outstanding leader cultivated in the long-term struggle against the cruel exploitation by the exploiters under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working people, a great thinker proficient in Marxism-Leninism, and a battle-hardened revolutionary banner of the working class. They forgot the existence of the powerful Communist Party that had experienced the battle against Hitler's fascism and enjoyed the great trust and love of all working people. On the night of February 20, Comrade Gottwald called on the people to hold a mass meeting in Stare Mesto Square on the morning of the 21st. All working people and Communist Party members responded enthusiastically to this call. At night, they vigilantly guarded factories, mines, and their own companies and enterprises to prevent sabotage by the reactionaries. On the morning of the 21st, hundreds of thousands of people formed a huge torrent, rushing to Stare Mesto Square, waiting for Gottwald's call to battle. At this time, the working people had put forward their first slogan: "Drive the traitors out of the government!" When Gottwald issued a call, demanding that all honest democrats, patriots, workers, peasants, working intellectuals, and handicraftsmen throughout the country immediately organize action committees to restore the National Front in their own enterprises and work units, unite and fight against the reactionary traitors, and actively smash their conspiracy, it immediately received a warm response from the whole country. Every factory, remote mountain village, prosperous city, and the center of each district and state, established action committees composed of loyal patriots in the two days of February 21 and 22. They took on the responsibility of defending the Republic in a fighting posture. The Czechoslovak people rose up and resolutely gave the traitors a firm blow. The National Congress of Factory Committees was held on the 22nd. The resolution to hold a one-hour commemorative strike on the 24th was enthusiastically passed at the meeting. This showed the strong will and determination of the working class and all working people of the country. On the 25th, the people's faithful representatives formed a new National Front. Beneš, the President - the broker of imperialism - was forced to recognize Gottwald's new government on the 25th. Those bourgeois conspirators were frightened and at a loss under the just anger of the people; and those reactionary leaders were even more embarrassed, like stray dogs with their tails between their legs, trying to flee abroad to seek refuge with their imperialist masters. The Czechoslovak people, united around the new National Front, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its wise leader Comrade Gottwald, finally completely won the victory of defeating the reactionaries, and forever shattered the regime held by the bourgeois reactionaries. On February 25, 1948, Comrade Gottwald delivered a speech to 100,000 working people gathered in the central square of Prague, saying: "The cause of the people has triumphed! Today will become the most glorious day in our new history."
    The bankruptcy of the imperialist brokers' conspiracy aroused the frenzied barking of the imperialists. But Czechoslovakia is no longer their cash cow. It is more closely and faithfully united with its liberator and beloved brother - the Soviet Union. It stands more firmly at the invincible forefront of people's democracy, and it guards the position of the world peace camp with greater determination and perseverance. The Czechoslovak people lost only a yoke around their necks on the road to socialism, clearing away the stumbling blocks that directly stood in the way of our path to a new happy life. The example provided by the Soviet people is the new happy life that we are constantly striving for now. The first Gottwald Five-Year Plan began in 1949, which was another heavy blow to the enraged imperialism. Precisely in
    those unforgettable days of 1949, when Mao Zedong's heroic troops defeated the enemy, and the Chinese people achieved historic victories, in Czechoslovakia, the new and powerful factories stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan were established. The Five-Year Plan will turn our splendid motherland into a fortress of world peace and a truly happy home for the working people.
    Of course, imperialism will not give up its conspiracies and tricks against the people's democratic Czechoslovakia because of this. After the February victory shattered the conspiracy of their running dog - the bourgeois broker Beneš, they re-used another running dog, a gang of criminals who lurked directly in the Communist Party and wanted to simply operate on the heart of the Party with vicious intentions. But Tito-Zionist spies could not find a good end here either. Since 1949, due to the Party Central Committee's high degree of revolutionary vigilance and foresight, Gottwald's brilliant insight and rich revolutionary experience, the crimes of the bandits had already been exposed, and all of them were solved and brought to justice in 1951-1952. In November 1952, the ringleader of this group of bandits, Slánský, and thirteen other principal criminals in the conspiracy case were brought to the people's court. The flames of people's justice burned the source of sin. Let imperialism complain to heaven and earth! Anyway, the Czechoslovak people have only one answer: we must form a brotherly and permanent alliance with the Soviet people, form a flesh-and-blood friendship with the powerful People's China and various people's democratic countries, severely suppress all the bandits who dare to come and make trouble, and wipe out all the spies and agents they sneak in.
    With the selfless help of the Soviet Union and the sincere and friendly support of the fraternal countries in the peace camp, we will build socialism in Czechoslovakia. Today we have entered the threshold of the decisive fifth year of the Gottwald Five-Year Plan. The total value of Czechoslovakia's industrial production last year has doubled compared with 1937 - the highest year in the history of industrial production. Our countryside is also celebrating the new life of victory. Our agriculture has gradually embarked on the road of socialist development. Culture has also made further progress. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the heroic march of the Soviet people towards the future of communism, encourages all our people to continue to march towards new realms and constantly consolidate the confidence of all our people in heading towards new creative victories. We will not spare our strength, we will fulfill our glorious and due responsibility with infinite loyalty - the task of a shock force in the struggle for universal security, peace, and progress. Holding high the victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin, according to the direction indicated by Gottwald, the Czechoslovak people must build socialism in their great motherland, and will gloriously and thoroughly fulfill the noble mission as a shock force!

    捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利日五周年
    捷克斯洛伐克作家扬·德尔达
    今天，捷克斯洛伐克全国人民怀着无限兴奋和自豪的心情，来庆祝一九四八年二月二十五日事件的五周年纪念。这一天，是紧接着一九四五年五月九日光荣的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克之后的又一个伟大的共和国节日，是我国新的历史上最光辉灿烂的一页。
    如果说，一九四五年五月九日捷克斯洛伐克的解放——斯大林的难忘的恩典——使我国人民成为自己祖国的真正主人，那么，一九四八年二月二十五日，人民战胜反动派的伟大胜利，就给在我国建成社会主义提供了有力的保证，并彻底地粉碎了美帝国主义走狗——卖身投靠的资产阶级所把持的政权，拯救了我们祖国免于再蹈比慕尼黑更可耻的覆辙——帝国主义强盗处心积虑地为捷克斯洛伐克人民所设下的陷阱。
    还在希特勒占领期间，当捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下艰苦卓绝地展开反法西斯、捍卫民族独立斗争之际，一小撮蝟集在贝奈斯周围的资产阶级分子、庇荫于伦敦的卖国贼就已包藏祸心，准备在希特勒法西斯匪帮垮台后，利用罪恶的阴谋手段窃取政权，使捷克斯洛伐克重遭英美帝国主义的蹂躏。但是，斯大林军队的胜利进军，解放了欧洲，同时也给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来了自由，使得我国劳动人民对捷克斯洛伐克共产党及其英明的领袖哥特瓦尔德同志怀有无比的信任和爱戴，因而使我国劳动人民在祖国解放以后，坚决地担负起领导的责任。捷克斯洛伐克共产党在国家事务中占有重要的地位，在捷克和斯洛伐克民族统一战线中成为最坚强的支柱。当时窃据捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统职位的阴谋家、帝国主义的掮客贝奈斯所领导下的、直接听命于帝国主义的资产阶级反动派，给自己布置了一连串的任务：拖人民下陷阱，混淆视听，破坏人民对新生活的理想，把被人民所拥戴的共产党从领导岗位上排挤下去，摧毁捷克斯洛伐克人民与苏联之间的忠实同盟，并借此给捷克斯洛伐克带上帝国主义的枷锁，任其奴役和宰割。
    反动派早已处心积虑地准备着反人民的勾当，他们表面上接受一九四五年四月制订的科息斯政府施政大纲中所宣布的基本原则：工业国有化；土地归劳动农民所有；惩办卖国贼和法西斯党徒；建立团结在民族委员会内的真正的人民政权。但事实上他们却另搞一套，专门从事破坏这些进步原则的勾当。一九四七年下半年，卖国贼更乘机阴谋进攻人民。在这一年中，捷克斯洛伐克遭受了严重的旱灾，田里的庄稼几乎全给旱死了。人民的粮食问题面临着灾难性的威胁。当时哥特瓦尔德总理便同苏联洽商，要求援助，斯大林同志立即予以直接支持，供给捷克斯洛伐克以大量粮食。这样，捷克斯洛伐克人民才得免于这次饥饿的灾难。
    反动派的诡计是想把他们自己的代理人贝奈斯安插在总统职位上，通过他使用总统职权来左右国家大事，以便孤立哥特瓦尔德和共产党，逐步把共产党排挤出政府。他们想用这种卑鄙手段来夺取政权。他们同时利用潜伏在部队和国家公安机关中的法西斯党徒阴谋举行武装暴动，收集武器，制订占领布拉格电台、武装一支法西斯作战部队的计划。总之，他们的阴谋是极其狠毒而阴险的。他们得到了帝国主义的充分帮助和幕后指使。但是，他们却忘记了这两件事：一为哥特瓦尔德领导下的共产党是有着高度的革命警惕性和决心；二为捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民随时准备牺牲一切来捍卫由于苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克而取得的胜利果实。
    一九四八年二月二十日罪犯们动手了，十二个资产阶级部长，两个国务秘书宣布辞职，并向当时政府的总理哥特瓦尔德提出辞职声明，他们企图借此胁迫哥特瓦尔德放弃总理职权。但他们却完全想错了。哥特瓦尔德同志既不是商店老板，也不是胆怯者，他是人民的真正的革命领袖、斯大林的优秀学生，他是在领导共产党和劳动人民长期反对剥削者残酷斗争中培养出来的杰出领袖，精通马克思列宁主义的伟大思想家，他是从斗争中千锤百炼出来的工人阶级革命的旗手。他们更忘记了曾经经历过反希特勒法西斯主义的战斗锻炼、享有全体劳动人民的巨大信任和爱戴的强大的共产党的存在。二月二十日夜半，哥特瓦尔德同志号召人民在二十一日清晨到斯坦洛美斯特斯基广场举行群众大会，全体劳动人民和共产党员都一齐热烈响应了这一号召。夜间，他们警惕地守护着工厂、矿山和自己的公司企业，防止反动派的破坏。二十一日清晨，成千上万的人们汇成巨大的洪流，奔向斯坦洛美斯特斯基广场，等待哥特瓦尔德的战斗号召。这时，劳动人民已提出了自己的第一个口号：“把卖国贼从政府中撵出去！”当哥特瓦尔德发出号召，要求全国一切正直的民主分子、爱国者、工人、农民、劳动知识分子和手工业者在自己的企业和工作单位中立即组织恢复民族阵线的行动委员会，团结起来与反动的卖国贼作斗争，积极打垮他们的阴谋蠢动时，立刻得到了举国一致的热烈响应。每一个工厂，偏远的山村，繁华的城市，各区和各州的中心，在二十一日和二十二日两天内纷纷成立了由忠实的爱国者组成的行动委员会。他们以战斗的姿态来肩负起保卫共和国的责任。捷克斯洛伐克人民奋身而起，毫不容情地给卖国贼以坚决的打击。二十二日工厂委员会全国代表大会开会了。会上热烈地通过了二十四日全国举行一小时纪念罢工的决议。这显示出全国工人阶级及全体劳动人民的坚强意志和决心。二十五日，人民忠实的代表们组成了新的民族统一战线，窃据总统职位的贝奈斯——帝国主义的掮客——在二十五日不得已承认了哥特瓦尔德的新政府。那些资产阶级阴谋家在人民正义的愤怒之下吓得张惶失措；而那些反动头子们更是狼狈不堪，活像一条条夹着尾巴的落水狗，冀图亡命国外，去投奔帝国主义主子。捷克斯洛伐克人民团结在新的民族统一战线周围，在共产党及其英明的领袖哥特瓦尔德同志领导下终于彻底地取得了打垮反动派的胜利，永远粉碎了资产阶级反动派所把持的政权。一九四八年二月二十五日，哥特瓦尔德同志向聚集在布拉格中央广场的十万劳动群众发表演说，他说：“人民的事业胜利了！今天将成为我国新的历史上最光荣的一天。”
    帝国主义掮客们的阴谋的破产，引起了帝国主义的穷凶极恶的狂吠乱嚷。但捷克斯洛伐克再也不是他们的摇钱树了，它是更密切和忠实地与自己的解放者、亲爱的弟兄——苏联团结起来了。它是更牢固地耸立在人民民主不可战胜的最前哨，它是以更大的决心和毅力守卫住世界和平阵营的岗位。捷克斯洛伐克人民失去的只是在走向社会主义道路上套在颈上的一副枷锁，清除了直接阻挡我们走向新的幸福生活道路上的绊脚石。苏联人民所提供的榜样，就是我们现在所不断争取的新的幸福生活。一九四九年第一个哥特瓦尔德五年计划开始了，这对于老羞成怒的帝国主义又是一个沉重的打击。正是
    一九四九年那些难忘的日子，当毛泽东的英雄部队把敌人打得落花流水，中国人民取得历史性胜利的时候，在捷克斯洛伐克，第一批五年计划中规定的新的、强大的工厂建立起来了。五年计划将把我们灿烂的祖国变成世界和平的堡垒，劳动人民真正幸福的家园。
    帝国主义当然是不会因此放弃其反对人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的阴谋诡计的。当二月胜利粉碎了他们的走狗——资产阶级掮客贝奈斯的阴谋之后，他们又起用另外一条走狗，这就是直接潜伏在共产党内，居心毒辣地想干脆从党的心脏开刀的一撮罪犯。但是铁托—犹太复国主义的坐探在我们这里也同样找不到什么好的下场。从一九四九年起，由于党中央高度的革命警惕性和预见性，哥特瓦尔德的英明卓见和丰富的革命经验，强盗们的罪行就已经被揭露了，在一九五一—一九五二年就被全部破案法办。一九五二年十一月，这一群匪帮的罪魁祸首斯兰斯基和另外十三名阴谋案主犯押上了人民的法庭。人民正义的火焰焚毁了罪恶的渊薮。让帝国主义去怨天尤人吧！反正捷克斯洛伐克人民只有一个答复：我们要和苏联人民结成兄弟般的永久的联盟，和强大的人民中国及各人民民主国家结成血肉般的友谊，痛剿一切敢于前来捣乱的强盗们，把他们偷送进来的所有的间谍特务一网打尽。
    在苏联无私的帮助下，在和平阵营各兄弟国家真诚友好的支持下，我们要在捷克斯洛伐克建成社会主义。今天我们已进入哥特瓦尔德五年计划有决定意义的第五个年头的门槛。捷克斯洛伐克去年工业的生产总值比一九三七年——历史上工业生产的最高年代——增加了一倍，我们的农村也欢庆着胜利的新生。我们的农业已逐步走向社会主义发展的道路。文化也有了进一步的高涨。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，苏联人民向共产主义前途的英雄迈进，鼓舞着我们全体人民不断地向新的境界进军，不断地巩固着我们全体人民奔向新的创造性胜利的信心。我们不会吝惜自己的力量，我们将无限忠诚地完成自己光荣而应尽的责任——一支争取普遍安全、和平与进步的突击队的任务。高举着列宁和斯大林的胜利旗帜，按着哥特瓦尔德所指示的方向，捷克斯洛伐克人民一定要在自己伟大的祖国建成社会主义，一定会光荣而彻底地完成作为一支突击队的崇高使命！
