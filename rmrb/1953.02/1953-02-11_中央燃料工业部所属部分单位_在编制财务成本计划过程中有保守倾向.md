Some units under the Central Fuel Industry Ministry system have shown a considerably serious conservative tendency in the process of compiling this year's financial cost plans and are unwilling to earnestly explore potential strengths.

    At the beginning of compiling plans, units such as the Shandong Mining Bureau inquired with the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, asking whether to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift this year. Their meaning was that if the campaign to increase production and practice thrift was not carried out, the cost plan could be set lower; otherwise, they would have to "hold back a little" so that they could immediately come up with a plan to increase production and practice thrift when the call came from above. The conservative thinking of some units is even more prominent. For example, the Shandong Mining Bureau failed to revise the wage quotas in time last year, and there were many problems in its management and administration. The financial plan was not completed, resulting in a loss of about 40 billion yuan. Some leading cadres of this bureau did not seriously analyze the reasons for the losses last year and learn from them. Instead, they mistakenly believed that the reason why the financial plan was not completed last year was that the plan was too "adventurous." They were very conservative when compiling this year's plan. Workshop expenses and enterprise management fees not only did not decrease, but increased by about 1,000 yuan per ton of coal compared to last year. The Central Fuel Industry Ministry instructed them to reduce these expenses, but they believed that since the cost did not exceed the target required by the ministry, they should not be asked to reduce them. The Petroleum Marketing Company under the Petroleum Administration Bureau was originally a relatively advanced unit in the Northwest transportation industry, but when compiling this year's plan, they hoped to use backward and conservative quotas to maintain their advanced title. According to last year's advanced standards, each tire should travel 32,000 kilometers, and the average number has already reached 30,000 kilometers, but when compiling this year's plan, they asked to use last year's fourth-quarter quota of 27,000 kilometers as this year's target.

    When compiling this year's plan, the higher-level leading organs requested that the parts that should be increased must be increased, and the parts that should be reduced must be reduced. However, when compiling the plan, many units quickly accepted the parts where the higher authorities wanted to give more money; they did not give good consideration to the parts that should be reduced, such as workshop expenses, enterprise management fees, and raw material consumption. For example, the cost plan of the power industry system has exceeded the target. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration also had the idea of being lenient in determining the working capital quota. The storage time of pit props is stipulated to be longer than that of the East China coal mine system, which is farther away from the timber production area.

    The Central Fuel Industry Ministry has promptly pointed out these conservative tendencies in the planning of various units, requiring them to revise the plan, put forward various advanced quotas, and ensure that an advanced plan is formulated in the first year of the country's five-year plan.

    中央燃料工业部所属部分单位
    在编制财务成本计划过程中有保守倾向
    中央燃料工业部系统的某些单位，在编制今年的财务成本计划过程中，有相当严重的保守思想，不肯认真发掘潜在力量。
    一开始编制计划，山东矿务局等单位就向中央燃料工业部打听消息，探问今年是不是还要开展增产节约运动。他们的意思是，假使不开展增产节约运动，成本计划就可以订低一些，否则就得“留一手”，以便将来上面一声号召，自己立刻就可以拿出增产节约计划来。有些单位的保守思想更为突出。如山东矿务局去年因为没有及时修改工资定额，加以经营管理中有许多毛病，财务计划没有完成，亏损了四百亿元左右。这个局的部分领导干部没有认真地分析去年造成亏损的原因，从中吸取教训，反而错误地认为去年所以没有完成财务计划是计划订得“冒险”了。他们今年编制计划时便很保守。车间经费和企业管理费用非但没有降低，反而每吨煤比去年增高了一千元左右。中央燃料工业部指示他们应将这些费用降低，他们却认为成本既然没有超过部里要求的指标，就不应该要求他们降低。石油管理总局所属石油运销公司，原是西北交通运输业中比较先进的单位，但在编制今年的计划时，他们竟希望用落后的保守的定额来保持自己的先进称号。按照去年的先进标准，每一轮胎应行走三万二千公里，按照平均数字也已达到三万公里，但在编制今年的计划时，他们却要求把去年第四季度的定额二万七千公里做为今年的指标。
    在编制今年的计划时，上级领导机关要求该提高的部分一定要提高，该削减的部分一定要削减。但许多单位在编制计划时，对上级要多给钱的部分，很快就接受了；对车间经费、企业管理费用以及原材料消耗等应该削减的部分，却没有很好地考虑。像电业系统的成本计划就突破了指标。东北煤矿管理局在确定资金周转定额时，也有宽打窄用的思想。坑木储存时间，规定得比离木材产地较远的华东煤矿系统还要长。
    中央燃料工业部已经及时指出各单位订计划中的这些保守倾向，要求他们修正计划，提出各种先进的定额，保证在国家五年计划的第一年度订出先进的计划。
