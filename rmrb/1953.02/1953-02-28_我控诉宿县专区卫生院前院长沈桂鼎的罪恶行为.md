Editor's Note: The incident of Comrade Hou Jinshan being framed not only exposes the crime of Shen Guiding, former president of the Suxian Special District Health Hospital, in framing cadres, but also reveals the serious bureaucracy of the Party and administrative leading organs of the Suxian Special District. The Party and administrative leading organs of Jiangsu Province should promptly investigate and handle this case and give the perpetrators the punishment they deserve.

Victim Hou Jinshan's Oral Account

I am from Xiaoxian County, Jiangsu Province, of poor peasant origin, 26 years old, and a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party. I started working very early and have worked as a correspondent, health worker, and head nurse. In April 1950, I was assigned by my superiors to work at the Suxian Special District Health Hospital. At that time, the president was Shen Guiding. He originally worked in the military sub-district and brought almost his entire team when he was transferred here. Shen Guiding promoted Zhu Chuanying to head of the Medical Administration Section and Song Yuan to head of the Preventive Health Section; his own wife, Yin Jing, was in charge of managing the warehouse. In this way, Shen Guiding and others formed a "ruling group" in the hospital. During his tenure at the hospital, Shen Guiding never entered the wards and spent his days having fun and fooling around with his wife, Yin Jing. After being promoted to section chiefs, Zhu and Song, relying on Shen's power, bullied those above and oppressed those below, acting despotically within the hospital. Song Yuan even privately carved a seal, impersonating a Party member; Zhu Chuanying was corrupt and had illicit affairs with women. Under Shen's manipulation, they deceived those above and concealed from those below. In 1950, only fifteen health centers were actually established in the Suxian Special District, but the hospital audaciously and falsely reported to the higher authorities that there were eighty-five, fraudulently obtaining 100,000 jin of construction grain. In July 1950, when we were rescuing disaster victims in the Beiwang District of Xiaoxian County (which belonged to Anhui Province before Jiangsu was established), we actually rescued only 16,000 people, but he falsely reported more than 100,000. In order to defraud the higher authorities of money and goods, Shen Guiding even locked up Lu Benjie, a staff member of the Preventive Health Section, in a room to fabricate false figures.

During his tenure, Shen Guiding never went to the wards and never cared about the suffering of the patients. Once, the logistics department steamed buns that were too big (about half a jin each), and seriously ill people couldn't eat them. I reported this to Shen Guiding, but Shen said, "If they don't eat them, so be it."

Shen Guiding never even mentioned educating the hospital staff. Therefore, incidents of nurses and others beating and scolding patients occurred frequently. Some evil elements, such as Xie Nanxia (who has been expelled), even took barbaric actions and raped female patients when they groaned in bed.

I reported the above facts at the hospital's administrative meetings and also reported them to Shen in writing, but Shen turned a deaf ear. Once, Shen even called me aside, berated me severely for four hours, and said that I was "interfering."

In 1950, patients recuperating in the hospital expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership, and some comrades said, "Let's report (criticize) it to the newspaper." When Shen Guiding learned of this, he said, "Bring them here, I'll beat them up, and then let them go criticize."

Because Shen Guiding ignored the situation I reported, in January 1951, I reported the situation of the hospital to Su Shuxuan, the director of the former Wanbei Administrative Office Health Department, and in February, I also reported to the Suxian Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, the Health Department did not send anyone down to investigate in time, but instead gave my report to Shen Guiding's wife, Yin Jing, to read (Yin Jing had gone to Hefei from Suxian for a meeting). Yin immediately wrote an urgent letter to inform Shen Guiding (Shen had gone to a meeting at the East China authorities). Shen sent a express letter from Shanghai to be received by Yin Jing personally, saying that bad elements were active. After receiving the letter, Yin Jing reported to the Prefectural Public Security Bureau, saying, "There are bad people in the hospital." This was during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries (April 1951). Later, when Shen Guiding returned from Shanghai, I was falsely accused of being a counter-revolutionary under the fabricated charge of "colluding with secret agents for armed rebellion and deserting with a gun."

In April 1951, with Shen Guiding's approval, I took leave to go home to visit relatives. It was at this time that Shen Guiding reported me. At that time, the Suxian Prefectural Public Security Bureau one-sidedly listened to Shen's opinion and sent armed personnel to my father-in-law's house (I was playing at my father-in-law's house at the time). Without allowing me to explain, they tied me up and took me to the Prefectural Public Security Bureau.

It should be explained here that the people who arrested me and the personnel who interrogated me also adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards my case.

I was arrested on April 15, 1951, and the interrogation began on the 16th. The interrogators at that time were Tang Yide, the chief of the Security Section of the Public Security Bureau, and Gan Huachang, the chief of the Interrogation Section, among others. They were bureaucrats and groundlessly questioned me, saying, "Who are you colluding with? Where is the radio station located? How much money (activity expenses) do you receive from the Xuzhou Bank every month?" They also threatened to publicly try me and execute me.... I was already exhausted from being interrogated in shifts, and I really had nothing to confess. I told the interrogators, Gan Huachang and others, about the situation in the hospital and the fact that I was falsely accused by Shen Guiding (after being arrested, I fully realized that Shen was behind it), but they ignored me. Later, when they interrogated me again, I still told them that Shen Guiding had framed me. Not only did they completely reject my opinion, but they sometimes insulted me, causing me extreme pain and humiliation.

Shen Guiding, fearing that he wouldn't be able to kill me, pulled in a so-called "hostage." This "hostage" was Sun Xuepin (nicknamed "Fool," who was actually a fool) who I had played with. Shen Guiding convened a meeting to struggle against Sun Xuepin, insisting that Sun Xuepin was also not a "good person" and that he knew that I was going to "collude with secret agents for armed rebellion" and assassinate Chen Tingyuan, the hospital's assistant director. Shen, fearing that it was not reliable, found Sun Xuepin again and conducted several individual talks, telling him to say that I was "colluding with secret agents for armed rebellion, attempting assassination."

This unjust accusation finally led me into prison. The administrative side announced my dismissal, and my Party membership was also gone.

The Suxian Prefectural Public Security Bureau couldn't get anything out of me, so they transferred me to the Prefectural Supervisory Office. Liu Yongze, the inspector of that office, started interrogating me again. Still unable to get any clues, he brought up the so-called "hostage," Sun Xuepin, for a face-to-face confrontation. After that, Shen Guiding personally came out for the confrontation. I was furious at the time and exposed Shen Guiding's shameless conspiracy on the spot, but the interrogators of the Supervisory Office said that I was "attacking Shen Guiding." When I tried to explain further, the interrogators of the Supervisory Office would not allow me to speak.

The Prefectural Supervisory Office couldn't get anything out of me, so they transferred me to the Prefectural People's Court for "acceptance."

After being arrested, I wrote reports to the Suxian Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Prefectural People's Court, and the Supervisory Office, but none of them were processed at the time. It wasn't until December 1951 that the Organization Department of the Prefectural Party Committee and the General Party Branch Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Prefectural Party Committee and the Prefectural Government sent people to understand my situation. This gave me some comfort and encouragement.

After I was escorted to the court, the court doubted my case and didn't believe it. But it wasn't until the "Three-Anti" campaign began that the leaders wanted to understand from me whether Shen Guiding had embezzled materials. After my repeated appeals, it was confirmed that my case was completely false. It was then that I was released by leading comrades such as Wu Xianxian, the former Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Party Committee, and my freedom was restored, my work was restored, and my Party membership was restored.

The above is the process of my being framed by Shen Guiding. I spent a full eleven months in prison (locked up with all the important counter-revolutionaries and wearing heavy shackles for six or seven months). When I left the court, I had almost become an insensible person, deaf and dizzy, thin and weak. I am a person who was almost killed. Now that I am out of court, how grateful I am to the Party!

What I want to accuse is that it has been a year since the "Three-Anti" campaign, and Shen Guiding, this evil element, has not yet received the punishment he deserves and is still at large; and some bureaucratic elements related to this case have not been properly dealt with. Please support my accusation in the Party newspaper and wage a resolute struggle against these lawbreakers and bureaucrats!

    我控诉宿县专区卫生院前院长沈桂鼎的罪恶行为
    编者按：侯金山同志被陷害事件，不仅揭露了宿县专区卫生院前院长沈桂鼎陷害干部的罪行，而且暴露了宿县专区党和行政的领导机关的严重官僚主义。江苏省党政领导机关应迅速调查处理这件案子，给犯罪者以应得的处分。
    被害人侯金山口述
    我是江苏省萧县人，贫农成份，现年二十六岁，中共正式党员。我很早就参加了工作，曾干过通讯员、卫生员、护士班长等工作。一九五○年四月上级分配我到宿县专区卫生院工作。那时院长是沈桂鼎。他原在分区部队工作，他调到这里工作时，几乎从分区带来了全班人马。沈桂鼎提拔了朱传英为医政课长，宋元为预防保健课长；他自己的老婆尹静则担任管理库房的工作。这样，沈桂鼎等就在院中形成了一个“统治集团”；沈桂鼎在该院工作时，向来未进过病房，整天和老婆尹静开心取乐，鬼混一起。朱、宋二人被提拔为课长后，借着沈的势力，在院内欺上压下，横行霸道。宋元竟私刻图章，冒充党员；朱传英贪污腐化，乱搞女人。在沈的操纵下，瞒上欺下。一九五○年宿县专区实际上只成立十五个卫生所，该院胆大妄为地向上谎报为八十五个，骗取了十万斤建设粮。一九五○年七月我们在萧县（那时江苏还没有建省，该县属安徽）北望区抢救灾民时，实际上只抢救了一万六千人，他竟谎报了十万多人。沈桂鼎为了骗取上级的财物，竟把预防保健课课员吕本杰关在屋里，编假数字。
    沈桂鼎在任职期间，从来不下病房，对病人的疾苦是根本不问的。有一次事务处把馍蒸的太大了
    （有半斤左右），重病的人不能吃，我报告沈桂鼎，沈却说“不吃就算”。
    沈桂鼎对院内的工作人员进行教育更是谈不上了。因此，护士等打骂病人的事情是经常发生的。有的恶劣分子如谢南侠（已开除），当女病人呻吟床褥的时候，竟丧心病狂地采取野蛮的行为，奸污了她们。
    以上事实，在该院行政会上我都作了报告，并曾书面向沈报告过，沈都置若罔闻。有一次，沈竟把我叫到一边，熊（痛骂）了我四个钟头，还说我是“管什么的”。
    一九五○年在院休养的病人对领导方面表示不满，有的干部同志说：“我们向报社反映（指批评）去”。这事被沈桂鼎知道了，他说：“拉来，我揍他一顿，再让他去批评。”
    由于沈桂鼎对我反映的情况采取置之不理的态度，一九五一年一月我就把该院的情况报告给前皖北行署卫生处苏书轩处长，二月间又向中共宿县地委报告。当时卫生处未及时派人下来检查，反把我的报告交给沈桂鼎的老婆尹静看（那时尹静由宿县去合肥开会）。尹就写急信告诉沈桂鼎（那时沈到华东机关去开会）。沈在上海发快信寄给尹静亲收，信上说是坏分子活动。尹静接信后，即向专署公安处报告说：“院内出了坏人。”这时（一九五一年四月）正是镇压反革命的时候。后来沈桂鼎从上海回来，我就在沈桂鼎所捏造的“通特暴动，拖枪逃跑”的罪名下，被诬为反革命分子了。
    一九五一年四月，我经沈桂鼎批准请假回家探亲。就在这时，沈桂鼎告发了我，当时宿县专署公安处竟片面地听信了沈的意见，派武装人员到我的岳父家（那时我正在岳父家玩），不容分辩，将我绑起来带到了专署公安处。
    这里应该说明：捕我的人以及审讯的人员，对我的事情也采取了官僚主义的态度。
    我是在一九五一年四月十五日被捕的，十六日开始审讯。当时的审讯人是公安处保卫科科长汤宜德、审讯科科长甘化昌等人。他们是官僚主义者，毫无根据地质问我说：“你通那些人？电台设在那里？每月从徐州银行领取多少钱（活动费）？”并声言要公审我，枪决我……。我因被轮番地审讯，已经疲倦不堪了，我实在没有什么可供的。我便向审讯人员甘化昌等述说卫生院的情况，以及被沈桂鼎诬告（被捕后，我完全知道是沈搞的鬼）等情，他们也不加以理睬。等以后再审讯我时，我仍然告诉他们是沈桂鼎陷害了我，他们不仅完全拒绝我的意见，并有时辱骂我，使我受了极大的痛苦与污辱。
    沈桂鼎怕害不死我，又拉了一个所谓“人质”。这个“人质”便是曾和我一起玩过的孙学品（外号傻子，实际上也是傻子）。沈桂鼎召开了一次会议，对孙学品进行斗争，硬说孙学品也不是“好人”，说他知道我要“通特暴动”、暗杀院内协理员陈廷元。沈还怕不牢靠，又找了孙学品，进行几次个别谈话，叫他说我是“通特暴动，企图暗杀”。
    这种不白之冤，终于使我走进了监狱。行政方面宣布将我撤职，我的党籍也没有了。
    宿县专署公安处从我那里审讯不出什么东西来，便把我转给专署监察处。该处的检查员刘永泽，又开始对我审讯了，仍然没有讯问出头绪，就把所谓
    “人质”的孙学品拉上来当面对质。之后，沈桂鼎亲自出面对质。我当时怒气冲天，就当场揭发了沈桂鼎的无耻阴谋，可是监察处的审讯人员反说我是
    “打击沈桂鼎”。我再想申述时，监察处的审讯人员就不容我说话了。
    专署监察处审讯不出什么东西，又把我转给专署人民法院“受理”。
    我在被捕后，曾先后向中共宿县地委、专署人民法院、监察处写了报告，当时都没有得到处理。直到一九五一年十二月，地委组织部和地委、专署直属机关党总支委员会才派人来了解我的情况。这就使我得到了一些安慰与鼓励。
    我被押解到法院后，法院方面对我的案件是怀疑的，不相信的。但直到“三反”开始，领导方面想从我这里了解沈桂鼎是否有贪污材料，经过我再次的申述，才证实了我的案件全部是假的。那时我才被前地委宣传部部长吴献贤等领导同志释放，并恢复我的自由，恢复了我的工作和党籍。
    以上是我被沈桂鼎陷害的经过。我在监狱里整整地蹲了十一个月（和一切重要的反革命分子关在一起，并带了六七个月的大镣）。当我离开法院时，我几乎变成一个失去知觉的人，耳聋眼花，瘦弱不堪。我是一个几乎被害死的人，现在出了法院，我是如何的感谢党啊！
    我要控诉的是：自“三反”到现在已经一年了，而沈桂鼎这个恶劣分子还未得到应得的制裁，仍然逍遥法外；而与此案件有关的一些官僚主义分子也未得到适当处理。请党报支持我这个控诉，对这些违法乱纪者和官僚主义分子作坚决的斗争！
                                （花纯儒笔录）
