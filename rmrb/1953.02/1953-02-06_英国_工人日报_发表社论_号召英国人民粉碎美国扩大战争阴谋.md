Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 5th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on February 2nd, commenting on U.S. President Eisenhower's announcement encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to attack the Chinese mainland, stating, "The United States has taken off its mask. Now it is about to expand the war in Korea and China."

The editorial called on the British people to "smash this war conspiracy." It pointed out, "The British people have always worried about the consequences of the despicable gangsterism of American politics. Now that the injustice of the American plan has been completely exposed, the British people must resolutely demand the withdrawal of British troops in Korea and must strongly oppose the American plan to expand the war."

The editorial emphasized the responsibilities of British workers in this situation, saying, "Every workers' organization that hopes for peace must direct its fire at the American attempts to expand the war. In the coming days, any gathering of working-class organizations should issue strong protests to the American government."

The editorial called on workers to hold mass rallies wherever possible to express the people's desire for peace.

    号召英国人民粉碎美国扩大战争阴谋
    【新华社布拉格五日电】伦敦“工人日报”二月二日发表社论，评论美国总统艾森豪威尔宣布鼓励蒋介石匪帮进攻中国大陆时说，“美国已取下了假面具。现在它就要对朝鲜和中国扩大战争。”
    社论号召英国人民“粉碎这个战争阴谋”。它指出，“英国人民一向担心可恶的美国政治强盗行为的后果。现在美国计划的非正义性既已完全暴露，英国人民就必须坚决要求撤退在朝鲜的英国军队，必须极力反对美国的扩大战争的计划。”
    社论强调英国工人在这种形势下所应负的责任说，“每一个希望和平的工人组织，它们的火力必须针对着美国扩大战争的企图。在今后这几天内，任何工人阶级组织的集会都应该向美国政府提出强硬的抗议。”
    社论号召工人们在任何可能的地方举行群众大会，以表示人民要求和平的愿望。
