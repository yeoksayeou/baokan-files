    Political Report
    -- Report at the Fourth Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on February 4, 1953
    Chairman Zhou, Members, Comrades:
    Our current Fourth Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is convened at a time when the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is continuing to strengthen, at a time when the economic recovery phase of our country has ended and the first five-year plan for national economic construction is beginning, and also at a time when the Central People's Government has passed a resolution to convene this year people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels elected by the people through universal suffrage, and on this basis, to convene the National People's Congress in order to further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, the tasks before us are significant and glorious.
    Looking back to three years and four months ago, at the beginning of the founding of our People's Republic of China, we did not yet have the conditions to carry out large-scale planned economic construction. At that time, the unification of the country remained to be completed, the remnants of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial system remained to be eliminated, the new-democratic social system remained to be established, the wounds of more than twenty years of prolonged war remained to be healed and restored, and the people's level of awareness and organization remained to be raised and strengthened. Precisely because of this, during these three years or more, our task has been to concentrate our efforts on creating the necessary conditions so that our people can strive for the industrialization of the country and ensure that our country can steadily advance towards socialism. In line with the situation during this period, we adopted the temporary measure of having the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference temporarily exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, and having the people's representative conferences at all levels gradually act on behalf of the local people's congresses at all levels; at the same time, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference became a temporary charter for the people of the whole country to practice revolutionary unity.
    Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after more than three years of firm efforts and resolute struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, have won brilliant victories on all fronts, bringing about profound and fundamental changes in all aspects of Chinese society.
    Our country has achieved unprecedented people's unity. With the exception of Taiwan, more than two million bandits on the mainland of our country have been eliminated, and the remnants of counter-revolutionaries have been severely打击. We have successfully carried out the work of consolidating national defense, and powerfully thwarted the American imperialists' vain attempt to occupy Korea and then invade the Chinese mainland. The independence and unity of our country have achieved unprecedented greatness.
    With the exception of some areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, land reform has been completed in areas with approximately 450 million agricultural population across the country, and the foundation of feudalism has been thoroughly destroyed. The remaining privileges of imperialism have been abolished, and the era in which the Chinese people were treated as objects of plunder and exploitation has come to an end. Bureaucratic capitalist enterprises are wholly owned by the state and have been thoroughly transformed into state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature.
    The national industrial and agricultural production has not only been fully restored, but generally has exceeded the highest levels of previous years. In line with this situation, transportation has also been greatly restored and developed. Domestic trade is becoming increasingly active and growing due to the promotion of material exchange between urban and rural areas. The state's financial revenue and expenditure have been balanced, and national prices have been stabilized. The people's material life, cultural life, and health conditions have all improved significantly.
    The strength and proportion of the socialist state-owned economy have greatly developed. In industry and wholesale commerce, the state-owned economy has been in a leading dominant position. In 1952, state-owned industry accounted for more than 60 percent of the total national industrial output excluding handicrafts, including about 80 percent in heavy industry and about 50 percent in light industry. In the wholesale business of commercial operations, the state has basically controlled the main commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as grain, cotton, yarn, cloth, steel, coal, timber, oil, salt, and important export commodities. The national bank has been uniformly managed by the state. This guarantees the needs of social production and consumption, the stability of national prices and finance, and the balance of import and export trade and financial revenue and expenditure. At the same time, on the other hand, private industrial and commercial enterprises have been led and supported by state-owned economic organizations and state administrative organs through methods such as commissioned processing and ordering, reasonable procurement, and commercial adjustments. Also, the great "Five-Anti" movement has eradicated its "five poisons" that harmed the national economy and the people's livelihood, so it gradually reduced or avoided blindness, speculation, and destructiveness, thus achieving a certain degree of development along the track stipulated in the Common Program. The individual economies of farmers and handicraftsmen have begun to be transformed. The movement for mutual aid and cooperation in agriculture has greatly developed in various places. In the old liberated areas, the organized peasant households generally account for more than 65 percent of the total number of peasant households; in the newly liberated areas, they generally account for about 25 percent. Nearly four thousand agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established throughout the country, more than a dozen collective farms with typical experimental natures and more than two thousand state farms have been established, and more than two thousand six hundred handicraft producers' cooperatives have begun to be organized. By the end of 1952, there were more than 34,000 supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide, with more than 144.1 million members, and their purchase of agricultural products averaged about 60 percent of the total state purchase. Obviously, these facts show that the mutual aid and cooperation movement has increasingly become an important factor in the new democratic economy.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through trade unions, peasant associations, the New Democratic Youth League, women's federations, student unions, industrial and commercial federations, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and various people's organizations in the fields of literature and art and science, the Chinese people have been further organized on a national scale. In the past three years, we have relied on the strength of the people to carry out the great struggles of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the ideological transformation of intellectuals. Thanks to the education of these struggles, the level of awareness of the Chinese people has been unprecedentedly improved. Particularly outstanding achievements in this regard are: the clear distinction between ourselves and the enemy among the broad masses of people, the destruction of the remaining influence of Chinese counter-revolutionaries and imperialism, the criticism of the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie, and the further consolidation of the leading position of the working class and socialist ideology. This work has made our people's democratic united front more consolidated, forming an organized and conscious contingent of hundreds of millions of people. In the past year, all sectors of the country have launched a study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a study of the Common Program. Recently, all sectors of the country have also launched a study of Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. These studies will arm our minds and enable us to work and transform ourselves better and more consciously.
    Since the Tibetan people returned to the great family of the motherland, the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities has made great progress. In areas where ethnic minorities live in compact communities throughout the country, ethnic autonomous regions are being gradually established. The patriotic political awareness of the people of all ethnic groups is increasing day by day, and the fraternal relations of equality, cooperation, friendship, and unity among the ethnic groups are becoming increasingly consolidated. The political, economic, and cultural lives of all ethnic groups united in the great family of the motherland are beginning to undergo historically significant developments.
    The above achievements show that the economic, political, and ideological leading position of our working class has been strengthened, the economy destroyed in the long war has been restored, and the people's democratic dictatorship has gained a solid foundation. These have created favorable conditions for our country to carry out long-term, planned, large-scale national construction.
    It must be pointed out that these achievements have been mainly obtained in the course of the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Two and a half years ago, the American imperialists launched a brutal war of aggression in our neighboring country of Korea, crossed the 38th parallel, and reached the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on our national border, while also occupying our Taiwan. Our people, in order to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, to defend our national security, and to support the Korean people's just struggle against aggression, resolutely launched the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Millions of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, repelling the aggression of the American imperialists, and forcing the enemy to retreat to the 38th parallel. This disrupted the American imperialists' war timetable for invading the world, increased the internal contradictions of the imperialist camp, and made the American imperialists' vain attempt to infringe upon the peace and democratic camp and expand aggression encounter increasingly serious difficulties. This armed anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese people did not, as the imperialists had dreamed, cause the stagnation or interruption of our social transformation and economic recovery work. On the contrary, it greatly stimulated the great patriotism and internationalism of our people, infinitely strengthened the spiritual and political unity of our people, significantly enhanced our country's international status, powerfully expanded the movement of the world's people against war and in defense of peace, and strengthened the strength and influence of the international peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. This great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea played a great role in promoting the transformation and recovery work in all aspects of our country. The people of the whole country universally and enthusiastically participated in this struggle by formulating patriotic pacts and implementing increased production and thrift. In this struggle, the people of the whole country resolutely shattered the pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideas left in some people by the reactionary education of the reactionary Kuomintang. The people of the whole country responded to the war conspiracy of the American imperialists by enthusiastically participating in the world peace signature campaign. The people of the whole country defeated the American germ warfare through the mass patriotic health movement. The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea actually guaranteed and promoted the early and victorious completion of our cause of social transformation and economic recovery.
    Comrades! Three years is not a very long time. However, the achievements in all aspects of our motherland have made our enemies panic and our friends rejoice.
    The reason why we have been able to achieve such great achievements is that our people's democratic social system and state system have great superiority over the capitalist system, which enables the broad masses of the people to give full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity; it is because all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democratic elements and overseas Chinese in our country have formed a great people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; it is because of the wise foresight and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, which has guided our people, enabling them to have a clear direction in all complex events at home and abroad, and to advance towards victory with full confidence in constantly overcoming difficulties, promoting achievements, and correcting shortcomings.
    The reason why we have been able to achieve such great achievements is inseparable from the sincere, selfless, and fraternal assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his telegram to Chairman Stalin on February 11, 1952, congratulating the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "We thank the Soviet government and people for their warm and generous assistance to the Chinese government and people in the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its related agreements over the past two years. This assistance has greatly helped the recovery and development of the new Chinese economy and the consolidation of the country." This assistance, as Chairman Stalin pointed out in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "The point is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The point is, first of all, that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual assistance and for common economic uplift." The Sino-Soviet joint communiqué on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to China and the extension of the withdrawal period of the Soviet army from Lushunkou in September last year, as well as the scheduled and unconditional transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway at the end of the year, are powerful manifestations of this sincere desire. The unbreakable friendly and cooperative relationship between the two great allies of China and the Soviet Union is continuing to develop and strengthen. It has been and will continue to be a strong guarantee for the people of the world to oppose imperialist aggression and safeguard peace and security in the Far East and the world.
    In the process of our country's transformation and recovery, we have also received the friendly support of the people's democracies. Our sincere and friendly relations with the people's democracies are developing. Our country has signed a series of economic and cultural agreements with the people's democracies, including the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed on October 4, 1952, which further developed and consolidated our deep friendship and cooperation with the people's democracies.
    Our trade relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, especially trade relations with the Soviet Union, are growing rapidly. The proportion of our total trade with these countries in our total foreign trade has increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 72 percent in 1952, and will increase further in the future. Our country is a powerful component of the new democratic world market. Because our relations are sincerely mutually concerned and look forward to the common victory and advancement of both sides, and because our economic cooperation is based on "sincere desire for mutual assistance and for common economic uplift," this new democratic world market will inevitably continue to develop, consolidate, and grow stronger, and will inevitably infinitely strengthen the strength of the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    We will not discriminate against capitalist countries that are willing to develop trade relations with us on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully. We adhere to a policy of peace and oppose policies of war and aggression. We are willing to restore and establish trade relations with all countries that are willing to maintain peaceful relations and develop a peaceful economy. The trade agreement between China and Ceylon and the triangular trade agreement between China, the Soviet Union, and Finland are vivid examples. On the other hand, the "blockade" and "embargo" policies of various countries headed by American imperialists have not intimidated us, because it is not us who are really harmed by the blockade and embargo, but precisely those countries that have succumbed to the will of American imperialists and are imposing a blockade and embargo on our country. It must be pointed out that the US government is using its "blockade" and "embargo" policies to interfere in the internal affairs, diplomacy, and commercial trade policies of other countries, undermine the normal relations of the world market, attempt to monopolize certain raw materials and sales markets, and expand US military bases in order to manipulate the economic lifeline and political life of these countries. We believe that in these countries, all democratic forces that truly love peace and demand independence and autonomy will eventually rise up to oppose this malicious conspiracy of the American imperialists.
    Our policy of peace is determined by our country's people's democratic system; this policy is fully in line with the interests of the people of our country and the people of all countries in the world. However, the head of the imperialist camp, the American imperialists, who harbor the mad ambition to dominate the world, have never stopped interfering in and invading our country in the three years since the victory of our people's revolution, because they are unwilling to accept the shameful defeat they have suffered in China. At first, the United States ordered the remnant bandits of Chiang Kai-shek to bomb and blockade our southeastern coast, but it soon failed. Then, the American invaders launched a war of aggression against our close neighbor Korea, and at the same time occupied our territory of Taiwan and invaded our northeastern border, vainly attempting to restore their lost position in Asia and re-enslave the Korean and Chinese people. However, thanks to the heroic and strong fighting of the Korean and Chinese people, the evil conspiracy of the American imperialists and their international accomplices has suffered another shameful defeat. From the time when the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the Korean People's Army until the end of 1952, the so-called "United Nations Army" lost a total of 740,000 troops, of which the loss of US troops has exceeded 320,000, close to the total number of deaths, injuries, and captures of US troops during World War I. At present, the characteristics of the Korean War are: the Korean and Chinese people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger in the war, the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is becoming more and more consolidated, while the enemy is suffering more and more losses and consumption in terms of troops and materials, their morale is getting lower and lower, and their internal contradictions are getting deeper and deeper.
    In order to create and maintain international tension so that Wall Street bosses in the United States can seize the maximum war profits, American imperialists are unwilling to learn from this failure. Although the Korean and Chinese sides have continuously proposed fair and reasonable solutions to the Korean issue at the Panmunjom armistice negotiations, and an agreement has been reached on the 63 clauses of the draft Korean armistice agreement, although the Soviet representative at the 7th UN General Assembly proposed that the issue of immediate ceasefire and the repatriation of all prisoners of war be handed over to the "Committee for Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue" for resolution, and was endorsed by the Korean and Chinese sides, the American invaders still refused peace and coerced the 7th UN General Assembly to illegally pass the Indian proposal based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forced repatriation principle" without the participation of Korean and Chinese representatives in order to delay and expand the Korean War and continue to escalate international tensions. Encouraged by this illegal resolution of the United Nations, for two months, the US government has been intensifying its preparations for expanding war adventures in Asia. On the one hand, the American invaders continue to massacre prisoners of war in Korea, continue to carry out germ warfare, continue to wantonly bomb peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, and unilaterally tear up the agreement on not attacking the supply vehicles of the negotiating delegation, attempting to completely destroy the Korean armistice negotiations; on the other hand, they increasingly frequently use their air force invading Korea to violate our country's airspace, carry out bombing and strafing, massacre the Chinese people, and even send special agent planes to carry out criminal strategic reconnaissance over our country, sending down special agents, attempting to organize sabotage activities within our country, and directing and assisting the remnant bandits of Chiang Kai-shek in plotting conspiracies to disrupt us, in order to facilitate their expanded military actions of aggression. The people of the whole country must be highly vigilant about this situation, and on the one hand, they should continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and on the other hand, they should strengthen national defense forces and prepare to give a crushing blow to the enemies who dare to invade at any time and anywhere.
    The war policy and aggression policy of the American imperialists today generally threaten the peaceful life of the people of all countries in the world. The American imperialists occupy and establish many military bases in many countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas, wantonly interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, enslave the people of these countries, and coerce these countries to provide troops and materials for the unjust war of aggression against Korea. The US government is increasingly intensifying its coercion of the weakened British and French colonialists to carry out wars to massacre local people in Vietnam and Malaya, and is attempting to actually control and seize all of Britain and France's colonies in Asia and Africa in the name of "aid." American imperialists are attempting to realize their malicious conspiracy to expand aggression by using the trick of "Asians fighting Asians." They are doing their best to gather together a few reactionaries in Asia, first of all, to rearm the militarist forces of Japan, organize the Pacific aggression group, and seriously threaten the security of Asian countries. The barbaric American imperialists are accustomed to taking the Asian people as the objects of "testing" their "new weapons." Their first two atomic bombs were dropped on Asia, their first batch of germ bombs were also dropped on Asia, and Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are often taken to secret places as sacrifices for this kind of "testing." It is clear that American imperialism has become the biggest threat to peace in Asia and the Far East. Only by stopping and repelling this threat can the Asian people obtain peace and security. This is the common task of the people of all countries in Asia.
    The imperialist aggressive camp headed by the United States, just as Chairman Stalin analyzed in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," is "guaranteeing the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting the majority of its own residents and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by using wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at guaranteeing the highest profits." Their carrying out of these evil deeds clearly increases the war threat to the people of the world day by day. However, on the other hand, the world peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger. The targets for the first two years of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan have been overfulfilled. The Soviet people are steadily marching towards communism in the direction determined by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With the close assistance of the Soviet people, the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe are smoothly carrying out socialist construction and have already achieved brilliant achievements. The people's movement for peace and against war has already reached a worldwide scale and is continuing to develop and grow stronger with the vast momentum that attracts tens of thousands of people every day and every hour. The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in October last year and the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna in December were powerful demonstrations of the increasingly growing people's forces fighting for peace. The national liberation movement to break free from the shackles of colonial and semi-colonial status has developed from Asia and Africa to Latin America. The mass struggle of the Japanese and German people against US occupation and enslavement and against the rearmament of German and Japanese militarism is also developing day by day. At the same time, the contradictions within and between capitalist countries, and the contradictions between imperialist countries and their colonies and semi-colonies, have become increasingly prominent and acute. From Japan, through Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, to the Americas, we can see the increasingly high tide of sentiment against the enslavement policies of the American imperialists everywhere. In this way, the imperialist aggressive camp headed by the United States has exposed its inherent weakness, exposed its weakness as a relationship of rule and being ruled composed of countries with unequal status, and insoluble contradictions have arisen, and it will inevitably move towards division and war. This is as Chairman Stalin told us when describing the situation in the capitalist world: "From the outside, everything seems to be 'safe and sound'; ... but it would be wrong to assume that this 'safe and sound' will be preserved 'forever', to assume that these countries will endlessly endure American rule and oppression, to assume that they will not try to break free from American shackles and embark on the road of independent development." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR") This is also as Chairman Mao Zedong told us: "The enemy's foundation is weak, its internal disintegration is breaking up, it is detached from the people, it has an unsolvable economic crisis, therefore, it can be defeated." ("Unite all the revolutionary forces of the world to oppose imperialist aggression")
    The growth and consolidation of the peace and democratic camp, the development of the world people's peace movement, and the growth of internal contradictions within the imperialist camp all prove that the current international situation is developing in the direction predicted by Chairman Mao in his report "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Financial and Economic Situation of the Country" in June 1950, and is increasingly beneficial to us.
    These are the faces of the current domestic and international situation.
    Under such circumstances, the most urgent and important tasks for the people of our country at present are:
    First, the Chinese people's struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea must continue to be strengthened, and China's national defense forces must be further consolidated and strengthened. We must mobilize the people of the whole country to intensify the increase in production and economy, and work hard to support the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The people of the whole world clearly see that China has victoriously ended the period of economic recovery and entered a period of large-scale planned construction, and the Chinese people are full of enthusiasm for peaceful construction and the desire to maintain lasting peace. However, at any time, the Chinese people must be vigilant and expose the war conspiracies of the aggressors, and must be prepared at any time to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist forces that are hostile to the Chinese people and hinder China's construction. The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. If the new US government is still interested in ending the Korean War by peaceful means, it should unconditionally resume negotiations in Panmunjom. The Korean and Chinese sides are prepared to immediately cease fire in accordance with the draft Korean armistice agreement that has been reached, and then the "Committee for Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue" will resolve the issue of repatriation of all prisoners of war. Because in this way, it can quickly satisfy the ardent hope of the people of all countries related to the war and the people of the whole world to immediately stop the current war, and can open up a path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other related issues in the Far East. If the new US government continues to implement the policies of the Truman government, and still has no intention of resuming negotiations in Panmunjom and continuing and expanding the Korean War, then the Korean and Chinese people will continue to struggle in this regard, and are fully prepared. The Korean and Chinese people deeply understand that only by waging a resolute struggle against the provocations of the imperialists, so that every war plan of the imperialists is crushed, and every act of aggression is completely defeated, can they force the enemy to stop and obtain the peace that the people yearn for.
    Second, start the first five-year national construction plan. 1953 is the first year of the first five-year plan, and our industrial and agricultural production will have a significant increase compared with 1952. According to the production volume expected to be completed in 1952 and the preliminary plan for 1953, if the production volume in 1952 is taken as 100, then the increase in important industrial and agricultural products in 1953 is: pig iron 114, steel ingots 123, coal 100, power generation 127, oil 142, copper 139, lead 149, zinc 154, machine tools 134, caustic soda 131, cement 117, logging 138, cotton yarn 109, cotton cloth 116, paper 106, sugar 123, grain 109, cotton 116, tea 116. In line with the growth of industry and agriculture, the state's social, cultural, and educational construction expenditure in 1953 will increase by 55.86 percent compared with 1952, investment in transportation will increase by 64.97 percent, and investment in water conservancy will increase by 12.8 percent. These figures show that the scale of our national planned construction is extremely grand from the beginning, and the tasks before us are glorious and huge, and there are many difficulties. Therefore, mobilizing the working class and the people of the whole country, concentrating our efforts, overcoming difficulties, and striving to complete and overfulfill the construction plan for 1953 is our overriding central task throughout the year. In order to complete such a complicated task, we must carry out tense and accurate work in all aspects. We must ensure the state's revenue, so that the economic construction, national defense construction, and social and cultural construction plans are not affected by the lack of funds. We must practice thrift and oppose waste in all departments, especially in the production departments. We must fully exploit the potential production power under the conditions of need and possibility, reduce the cost of production, and increase the quantity and quality of products. We must strengthen commercial work and transportation work, improve business management, accelerate the circulation of industrial and agricultural products and smooth the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, in order to supply the needs of the people, stabilize prices, and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production. We must unite all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that they can play their due initiative under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the unified national plan. We must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promote advanced experience, organize widespread mass patriotic production competitions and economy movements, and gradually improve the living standards of workers and peasants on a basis of raising the level of industrial and agricultural production. We must make all working comrades understand that what we are facing are new things and new tasks, and only by opposing arrogance and complacency, humbly working hard to learn, and correcting mistakes and shortcomings can we overcome difficulties, complete tasks, and make ourselves easy to familiarize ourselves with business and make fewer mistakes. We must strengthen national discipline, oppose bureaucracy and commandism, punish those who violate laws and regulations, and strictly prevent saboteurs from slowing down and destroying. We believe that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of advanced Soviet technology and experts, the intelligent and hardworking Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals will be able to give full play to their great initiative and creativity, and realize every specific task and specific plan.
    Third, in order to continue to strengthen the forces resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and in order to smoothly realize the national construction plan, we must, in accordance with the resolution of the Central People's Government, mobilize the people of the whole country to actively prepare for and participate in the election of the National People's Congress and the People's Congresses at all levels, and realize further democratization, in order to give full play to the initiative of the people of the whole country to fight together. Everyone knows that, according to the Common Program and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, the temporary organizational forms that we have implemented for more than three years, in which the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercises the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, and the People's Representative Conferences at all levels gradually act on behalf of the People's Congresses at all levels, are to prepare conditions for the National and Local People's Congresses under the universal suffrage system. Now, on a national scale, military action on the mainland has long been completely ended, and land reform has been completed except in a few areas, and the people of all sectors have been organized. Therefore, according to Article 14 of the Common Program, the conditions for convening the National and Local People's Congresses under the universal suffrage system are fully ripe. In fact, for more than three years, a total of 13,637,000 representatives have participated in the People's Representative Conferences at all levels across the country, of which the number of those directly or indirectly elected by the people has gradually increased, and in general areas has reached more than 80 percent of the total number of representatives. In the country, 19 provinces, 85 cities, 436 counties, and the majority of more than 280,000 townships (villages) have elected People's Governments at each level by the People's Representative Conferences or the Peasant Representative Conferences of the township (village). This is enough to prove that the immediate implementation of universal suffrage is fully in line with the actual situation of the development of our people's democracy and the urgent demands of the people of the whole country. Although we are holding universal suffrage for the first time, and preparations will take a considerable amount of time, because the level of awareness and organization of our people has been greatly improved, and we have experience in convening the People's Representative Conferences at all levels; at the same time, we are currently adopting a direct election system, starting with the People's Congresses of the grassroots political power, so as long as the grassroots elections in rural areas and urban areas have sufficient preparation time and the election work is done well, the time for the election and convening of the representatives of the People's Congresses at the county and provincial (municipal) levels does not need to be separated for a long time, and it will not be difficult to convene the National People's Congress on this basis. The national election movement is about to begin, and we should widely publicize the great significance of this resolution of the Central People's Government among the people, and mobilize the people to seriously and solemnly participate in this election, so that they can elect the people they think are satisfactory and necessary to participate in the work of the state power and be responsible for managing state affairs and local affairs.
    After the National People's Congress is convened, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organizational form of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, should continue to exist in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. However, since the National People's Congress has decided to convene, the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, of course has no right to exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress. As for its future role, Chairman Mao Zedong said this in his closing speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1950: "Our country is steadily advancing in this way, through war, through new democratic reforms, and in the future, after the national economic and cultural undertakings have greatly prospered, after all conditions have been met, after the people of the whole country have given careful consideration and after everyone has agreed, we can calmly and properly enter the new era of socialism. ...
    "On this long-term goal, abroad, we must firmly unite the Soviet Union, all new democratic countries, and all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, and there must be no slightest hesitation or wavering on this. Domestically, we must unite all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democratic people, and we must consolidate our great and prestigious revolutionary united front that has been established. Anyone who contributes to the consolidation of this revolutionary united front is correct, and we welcome him; anyone who damages the consolidation of this revolutionary united front is wrong, and we oppose him."
    Chairman Mao's instruction shows that the People's Democratic United Front, which has made great contributions to the revolution, must continue to develop and consolidate in the future. In order to adapt to the current new situation, the Common Program and the Organizational Law of the CPPCC should be prepared for appropriate and necessary revisions. Every unit participating in this united front, under the leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, must recognize its responsibilities in the future, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, unite and work together, and strive to build a new democratic country and move towards socialism.
    Comrades! The three tasks before us are important and glorious. We have full confidence that we can victoriously complete these great and urgent tasks. Past experience has proven that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, are fully capable of achieving great and brilliant victories.
    The people of all ethnic groups and all social strata across the country should unite more closely, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong, and advance towards greater and more brilliant victories with full confidence!

    政治报告
    ——一九五三年二月四日在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的报告
    周恩来主席，各位委员，各位同志：
    我们这次中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第四次会议的召开，是在中国人民抗美援朝斗争继续加强的时候，是在我们国家经济恢复阶段已经结束、国家经济建设第一个五年计划正在开始的时候，也是在中央人民政府通过决议，定于今年召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会，以便进一步巩固我们人民民主专政的国家制度的时候，因而摆在我们面前的任务是重大而光荣的。
    回顾三年零四个月之前，在我们中华人民共和国成立之初，我们进行大规模的有计划的经济建设，条件尚未具备。当时，国家的统一尚待完成，半封建半殖民地制度的残余尚待扫除，新民主主义的社会制度尚待建立，二十余年长期战争的创伤尚待医治恢复，人民的觉悟程度和组织性尚待提高和加强。正因为如此，所以在这三年多的时间当中，我们的任务就是集中力量创立必要的条件，使我国人民有可能为国家的工业化而奋斗，并保证我国得以稳步地向着社会主义前进。与这一时期的情况相适应，我们采取了由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议暂时执行全国人民代表大会职权、由地方各界人民代表会议逐步代行地方各级人民代表大会职权的临时性的办法；同时，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领也就成为一部全国人民实行革命大团结的临时宪章。
    在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，经过了三年多的坚定努力和对国内外敌人的坚决斗争，在各个战线上都赢得了辉煌的胜利，使整个中国社会的各方面都发生了深刻的根本的变化。
    我们的国家已经实现了空前未有的人民的统一。除台湾外，我国大陆上二百万以上的土匪已被消灭，反革命残余分子已受到严重打击。我们胜利地进行了巩固国防的工作，有力地击破了美国帝国主义者企图侵占朝鲜并进而侵略中国大陆的狂妄阴谋。我们国家的独立和统一已经获得了空前伟大的成就。
    除一部份少数民族地区之外，全国约有四亿五千万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，封建主义的基础已被彻底打垮。帝国主义的残余特权已被废除，中国人民被当作掠夺和压榨对象的时代已告完结。官僚资本的企业完全归国家所有，并已被彻底改造，成为社会主义性质的国营企业。
    全国的工农业生产不仅已经全部恢复，而且一般已超过以往年代的最高水平。与这种情况相适应，交通运输也有了极大的恢复和发展。国内贸易因城乡物资交流的推进而日趋活跃增长。国家财政收支已经平衡，全国物价已告稳定。人民的物质生活、文化生活和卫生条件，都有了显著的提高。
    社会主义性质的国营经济的力量和比重有了很大的发展。在工业和批发商业方面，国营经济都已处于领导的优势地位。一九五二年，国营工业在手工业除外的全国工业总产量中占百分之六十以上，其中在重工业方面占百分之八十左右，在轻工业方面占百分之五十左右。在商业经营的批发业务方面，有关国计民生的主要商品，如粮食、棉花、纱、布、钢铁、煤、木材、油脂、盐和重要出口商品等等，基本上已由国家掌握。全国银行已由国家统一管理。这就保证了社会生产和消费的需要，保证了全国物价和金融的稳定，保证了出入口贸易和财政收支的平衡。同时，在另一方面，私营工商业由于国营经济机构和国家行政机关采取委托加工订货、合理收购、调整商业等方式加以领导扶助，又由于伟大的“五反”运动铲除了它的危害国家经济和人民生活的“五毒”，就逐步减少了或避免了盲目性、投机性和破坏性，从而沿着共同纲领所规定的轨道，得到了一定程度的发展。农民和手工业者的个体经济已经开始改造。各地农业互助合作运动有了很大的发展。在老解放区，组织起来的农户一般占农户总数的百分之六十五以上；在新解放区，一般占百分之二十五左右。全国各地成立了近四千个农业生产合作社，创办了十几个典型试验性质的集体农庄和两千多个国营农场，开始组织了二千六百多个手工业生产合作社。到一九五二年底止，全国已有三万四千多个供销合作社，拥有社员一亿四千一百余万人，其收购农产品的数字平均占国家收购总数的百分之六十左右。显然，这些事实表现出互助合作运动已日益成为新民主主义经济的重要因素。
    在中国共产党的领导之下，通过工会、农民协会、新民主主义青年团、妇女联合会、学生联合会、工商业联合会、中苏友好协会以及文艺方面、科学方面的各种人民团体，中国人民已在全国规模上进
    一步组织起来。在过去三年当中，我们依靠人民群众的力量，进行了土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”和知识分子思想改造等项伟大的斗争。由于这些斗争的教育，中国人民的觉悟程度获得了空前的提高。在这方面特别突出的成绩是：在全国人民群众中，分清了敌我界限，摧毁
    了中国反革命分子和帝国主义的残余影响，批判了资产阶级的腐朽思想，进一步巩固了工人阶级和社
    会主义思想的领导地位。这些工作使我们的人民民
    主统一战线更加巩固了，形成为数亿人民有组织的
    自觉的队伍。去年一年间，全国各界曾经展开了对
    于“毛泽东选集”的学习和对于共同纲领的学习。
    最近以来，全国各界又展开了对于斯大林同志的著
    作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和马林科夫同志在苏
    联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告的学习。这些学习将武装我们的头脑，使我们能更好地更自觉地进行工作和进行自我改造。
    西藏人民回到祖国大家庭来以后，汉藏民族的团结获得了很大的进步。全国各少数民族聚居的地区，正在逐步地成立民族自治区。各民族人民的爱国主义政治觉悟日益提高，各民族平等合作友好团结的兄弟关系亦日臻巩固。团结在伟大祖国大家庭中的各民族的政治、经济和文化生活方面正在开始有历史意义的发展。
    以上这些成就，说明我国工人阶级在经济上、政治上和思想上的领导地位已经加强，在长期战争中受到破坏的经济已经恢复，人民民主专政已经获得了巩固的基础。这些就替我国进行长期的、有计划的、大规模的国家建设创造了有利的条件。
    必须指出，这些成就，主要地是在抗美援朝的伟大斗争进行的过程中获得的。两年半之前，美国帝国主义者在我国邻邦朝鲜进行了灭绝人性的侵略战争，越过了三八线，到达了我国国境线鸭绿江和图们江边，同时并侵占了我国的台湾。我国人民，为了维护远东和世界的和平，为了保卫我国的安全，为了支持朝鲜人民反侵略的正义斗争，毅然决然地进行了伟大的抗美援朝运动。千百万中国人民的优秀儿女参加了中国人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打退了美国帝国主义者的侵略，并迫使敌人退回到三八线，这样就打乱了美国帝国主义者侵略世界的战争时间表，增加了帝国主义阵营的内部矛盾，使美国帝国主义者侵犯和平民主阵营扩大侵略的狂妄阴谋遭遇着日益严重的困难。中国人民这一反侵略的武装斗争并没有如同帝国主义者所梦想的那样，引起我国社会改造和经济恢复工作的停滞或中断，相反地，它却大大地激发了我国人民伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，无限地加强了我国人民精神上和政治上的团结，显著地提高了我国的国际
    地位，有力地扩大了世界人民反对战争保卫和平的
    运动，并加强了以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营的
    力量和影响。这个抗美援朝的伟大斗争对我们国家
    各方面改造和恢复的工作起了伟大的推动作用。全
    国人民普遍地用订立爱国公约和实行增产节约等方
    式热烈地参加了这个斗争。全国人民在这个斗争中，
    坚决地粉碎了在一部份人民中由于反动的国民党的
    反动教育所遗留下来的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想。全
    国人民用热烈参加世界和平签名运动来答复美国帝
    国主义者的战争阴谋。全国人民用群众性的爱国卫
    生运动，打败了美国的细菌战。抗美援朝运动实际
    上保证并促进了我们社会改造和经济恢复的事业的
    早日胜利完成。
    同志们！三年多的时间并不是一个很长的时间。
    可是我们祖国所得到的各方面的成就，已经使我们
    的敌人为之惶恐不安，而我们的朋友则为之欢欣鼓
    舞。
    我们之所以能够获得这样大的成就，是由于我们
    人民民主的社会制度和国家制度较之资本主义制度
    具有极大的优越性，它使广大人民群众能够发挥自
    己的劳动积极性和创造性；是由于我国各民族、各
    民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体以及一切爱国
    民主分子和海外华侨在中国共产党的领导之下，形
    成了伟大的人民民主统一战线；是由于我们伟大领
    袖毛泽东主席的英明的预见和领导，指引了我国人
    民，使能在国内外一切复杂事件中有明确的方向，
    在不断克服困难、发扬成绩和纠正缺点中，满怀信
    心地朝着胜利前进。
    我们之所以能够获得这样大的成就，是和我们伟
    大盟邦苏联的真诚无私的兄弟般的援助分不开的。
    毛泽东主席在一九五二年二月十一日致斯大林主席
    祝贺中苏友好同盟互助条约签订二周年纪念的电文
    中说：“我们感谢两年来苏联政府和人民依照中苏
    友好同盟互助条约及其有关各协定的精神，给予中
    国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大
    大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。”
    这些援助正如斯大林主席在“苏联社会主义经济问
    题”中所指出的：“问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度
    便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作
    的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿
    望。”去年九月间中苏两国关于中国长春铁路移交我
    国和苏军延长从旅顺口撤退期限的公报，以及后来
    中国长春铁路在年底的如期无偿移交，就是这种真
    诚愿望的有力表现。中苏两大盟国的牢不可破的友
    好合作关系正在继续发展和加强，它已经是、并将
    继续是世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和维护远东及世
    界和平与安全的坚强保证。
    在我国改造和恢复工作的进行中，我们也得到了
    各人民民主国家的友谊支持。我们与各人民民主国
    家之间的真诚友好关系正在开展。我国与各人民民
    主国家签订了一系列的经济和文化协定，其中包括
    一九五二年十月四日签订的中蒙经济及文化合作协
    定，进一步发展和巩固了我们与各人民民主国家相
    互之间的深厚的友谊和合作关系。
    我国与苏联和各人民民主国家之间的贸易关系，
    首先是对苏联的贸易关系，正在突飞猛进地增长。
    我们对这些国家的贸易总值在我国对外贸易总额中
    的比重，已经从一九五○年的百分之二十六增加到
    一九五二年的百分之七十二，今后还会要增加。我
    国是新的民主世界市场的一个有力的组成部份。由
    于我们之间的关系是诚恳地相互关心并切盼双方
    共同胜利前进的关系，由于我们的经济合作建立在
    “互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望”之上，
    这个新的民主世界市场必然会继续发展、巩固和壮
    大起来，必然会无限地加强以苏联为首的和平民主
    阵营的力量。
    凡是愿意和我们在平等互利的条件下发展贸易关系的资本主义国家，我们是不会予以歧视的。我们相信不同制度的国家可以和平共处。我们坚持和平政策，反对战争政策和侵略政策。我们愿意同一切愿意维持和平关系的国家恢复和建立贸易关系，发展和平经济。中国与锡兰之间的贸易协定和中国、苏联与芬兰之间的三角贸易协定就是生动的例子。但在另一方面，以美国帝国主义者为首的各国对我国的“封锁”“禁运”政策，却并未吓倒我们，因为真正受到封锁禁运的损害的并不是我们，恰好是那些屈从美国帝国主义者的意志而对我国实行着封锁禁运的国家自己。必须指出，美国政府正在利用其“封锁”“禁运”政策来干涉其他国家的内政、外交和通商贸易政策，破坏世界市场的正常关系，企图独占某些原料和销售市场，扩张美国军事基地，以便操纵这些国家的经济命脉和政治生活。我们相信，在这些国家中，一切真正爱好和平、要求独立自主的民主力量，终究会起来反对美国帝国主义者这种恶毒阴谋的。
    我们的和平政策是由我们国家的人民民主制度决定了的；这种政策完全符合于我国人民和世界各国人民的利益。可是，怀抱着称霸世界的疯狂野心的帝国主义阵营的头子——美国帝国主义者，在我国人民革命胜利后的三年间，由于不甘心于他们在中国所遭受到的可耻的失败，一直就没有停止过对我国的干涉和侵略。美国起先命令蒋介石残余匪帮轰炸和封锁我东南沿海，但是很快失败了。接着，美国侵略者就发动了对于我国近邻朝鲜的侵略战争，同时侵占我国领土台湾，并向我国东北边疆进犯，妄图借此恢复他们在亚洲失去的地位，再度奴役朝鲜人民和中国人民。但是，由于朝鲜人民和中国人民进行了英勇的坚强的战斗，美国帝国主义者和他们的国际帮凶们的罪恶阴谋又遭受到了可耻的失败。从中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战时起，直到一九五二年底止，所谓“联合国军”损失兵员共达七十四万之多，其中美军兵员的损失已经超过三十二万人，接近于第一次世界大战时美军的死伤和被俘的总数。目前朝鲜战争的特征是：朝中人民部队是越战越强了，中朝人民的战斗友谊越来越巩固了，而敌人则在兵员和物资方面的损失和消耗愈来愈大，士气愈来愈低，内部矛盾也愈来愈深了。
    为了制造并维持国际紧张局势，好替美国华尔街老板们攫取最大限度的战争利润，美国帝国主义者并不肯从这次失败中接受教训。虽然朝中方面在板门店停战谈判中，曾经不断地提出和平解决朝鲜问题的公平合理的方案，并且在六十三款的朝鲜停战协定草案上已经达成协议，虽然苏联代表在第七届联合国大会上，曾经提出了立即停战、战俘全部遣返问题交由“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决的建议，并且得到了朝中方面的赞成，可是，美国侵略者却仍然拒绝和平，并挟制第七届联合国大会在没有朝中代表参加之下，非法通过了以美国的所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”为基础的印度提案，以便拖延并扩大朝鲜战争，使国际局势继续紧张下去。在联合国这个非法决议的鼓励之下，两月以来，美国政府正在变本加厉地积极策划在亚洲从事扩大战争冒险的准备工作。美国侵略者一方面在朝鲜继续屠杀战俘，继续进行细菌战，继续滥炸朝鲜后方和平居民与和平设备，片面撕毁关于不袭击谈判代表团供应车辆的协议，企图把朝鲜停战谈判彻底破坏；另一方面则日益频繁地以其侵朝空军侵犯我国领空，施行轰炸扫射，屠杀中国人民，甚至派特务飞机到我国上空进行罪恶的战略侦察，降下特务分子，企图在我国内部组织破坏活动，并指使和协助蒋介石残余匪帮企图对我进行扰乱的阴谋，以便利他们的扩大侵略的军事行动。全国人民对这种情况必须高度警惕，一面应该继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，一面应该加强国防力量，准备随时随地对敢于来犯的敌人给以粉碎性的打击。
    美国帝国主义者今天的战争政策和侵略政策，普遍地威胁着全世界各国人民的和平生活。美国帝国主义者在欧洲、非洲、亚洲、美洲的许多国家中侵占和建立许多军事基地，横暴地干涉这些国家的内政，奴役这些国家的人民，并胁迫这些国家对于侵略朝鲜的非正义战争提供兵力和物资。美国政府正日益加紧地挟制已被削弱的英法殖民主义者在越南和马来亚来进行屠杀当地人民的战争，并以“援助”为名企图在实际上控制和夺取英法在亚洲和非洲的全部殖民地。美国帝国主义者正企图用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的诡计，来实现他们扩大侵略的恶毒的阴谋。他们正在尽力设法纠集起全亚洲的少数反动派，首先是重新武装日本的军国主义势力，组织太平洋侵略集团，来严重威胁亚洲各国的安全。野蛮的美国帝国主义者惯于拿亚洲人民来作为他们的
    “新武器”的“试验”对象，他们的头两颗原子弹正是投在亚洲的，他们的第一批细菌弹也是投在亚洲，朝中战俘更是经常被押到秘密场所去作这种
    “试验”的牺牲品。很显然的，美国帝国主义已经成了亚洲及远东和平的最大威胁。只有制止和击退这种威胁，亚洲人民才会得到和平与安全。这就是亚洲各国人民的共同任务。
    以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营，恰如斯大林主席在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所分析的，正在“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润”。他们进行这些罪恶行为，显然使世界人民所受的战争威胁日益增长了。但是，在另一方面，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营已经更为强大了。苏联第五个五年计划头两年的目标已经超额完成。苏联人民正循着苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所决定的方向稳步地走向共产主义。东欧各人民民主国家在苏联人民亲切的帮助之下，正顺利地进行着社会主义建设，并已有了光辉的成就。争取和平、反对战争的人民运动已经具有了全世界的规模，并且还在以每日每时都吸引着万千人民的浩大声势继续发展、继续壮大着。去年十月的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和十二月维也纳的世界人民和平大会，就是这种越来越壮大的为和平而斗争的人民力量的强大示威。为了挣脱殖民地半殖民地枷锁的民族解放运动已从亚洲、非洲发展到了拉丁美洲。日本和德国人民反对美国占领和奴役、反对重新武装德日军国主义的群众性斗争也在日益开展。同时，各资本主义国家内部和国家之间的矛盾，各帝国主义国家与其殖民地半殖民地之间的矛盾，已日益显明地尖锐起来。从日本经过东南亚、非洲、欧洲、直到美洲，到处都可以看到反对美国帝国主义者奴役政策的日益高涨的情绪。这样，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营，就暴露了它的先天弱点，暴露了它是由于地位不平等的国家所组成的那种统治与被统治的关系的弱点，而发生了不能解决的矛盾，并且不可避免地要走向分裂和战争。这正如斯大林主席在叙述资本主义世界形势时所告诉我们的：“从外表上看来，一切都好像是‘平安无事’的；……但是如果以为这种‘平安无事’会‘永世地’保存下去，以为这些国家将无止境地忍受美国的统治和压迫，以为它们不会设法挣脱美国的镣铐，而走上独立发展的道路，那就错了。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”）这也正如毛泽东主席所告诉过我们的：
    “这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。”（“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略”）
    和平民主阵营的壮大和巩固，全世界人民和平运动的发展，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的增长，这一切就证明了目前的国际形势正是循着毛主席于一九五○年六月在“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的报告中所预示的方向发展的，是对我们日益有利的。
    这些就是目前我国内外形势的面貌。
    在这样的形势之下，我国人民当前最迫切最重大的任务是：
    第一、中国人民的抗美援朝斗争必须继续加强，中国的国防力量必须进一步巩固和壮大起来。我们要动员全国人民加紧增产节约，努力工作，来支援抗美援朝的伟大斗争。全世界人民都清楚地看到：中国已经胜利地结束了经济恢复时期而进入了大规模的有计划的建设时期，中国人民是充满了和平建设的热情和维护持久和平的愿望的。可是，无论在什么时候，中国人民必须警惕和揭露侵略者的战争阴谋，必须随时准备着与敌视中国人民、阻碍中国建设的帝国主义势力进行坚决的斗争。中国人民爱好和平，但是并不惧怕战争。如果美国新政府还有意于用和平方法结束朝鲜战争，那么，它就应该无条件地恢复板门店的谈判。朝中方面准备按照已经达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，立即先行停战，然后再由“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决战俘全部遣返问题。因为这样，既可迅速满足有关战争各国人民及全世界人民对于立即停止现行战争的热望，又可为和平解决朝鲜问题及远东其他有关问题开辟道路。如果美国新政府仍然执行杜鲁门政府的政策，仍然无意于恢复板门店谈判而继续和扩大朝鲜战争，那么，朝中人民在这方面也将继续斗争下去，并且是有了充分准备的。朝中人民深刻地了解，对于帝国主义者的挑衅，只有进行坚决的斗争，使帝国主义者的每一个战争计划都受到粉碎性的打击，每一个侵略行动都遭到彻底的失败，才能迫使敌人罢手，取得人民所热望的和平。
    第二、开始第一个五年的国家建设计划。一九五三年是第一个五年计划的第一年，我们的工业生产和农业生产将比一九五二年有一个显著的增长。根据一九五二年预计完成的生产量和一九五三年的初步计划，如以一九五二年的生产量为一○○，则一九五三年的重要的工农业产品的增长数是：生铁一一四，钢锭一二三，煤一○○，发电量一二七，石油一四二，铜一三九，铅一四九，锌一五四，工具机一三四，烧碱一三一，水泥一一七，伐木一三八，棉纱一○九，棉布一一六，纸张一○六，糖一二三，粮食一○九，棉花一一六，茶一一六。与工农业的增长相适应，一九五三年国家的社会文教建设费用，将较一九五二年增加百分之五五·八六，运输交通事业的投资增加百分之六四·九七，水利事业投资增加百分之一二·八。这些数字表明了我们国家计划建设的规模，一开始就是极其宏大的，摆在我们面前的任务是光荣而巨大的，困难是很多的。因此，动员工人阶级和全国人民，集中力量，克服困难，为完成和超额完成一九五三年度的建设计划而奋斗，是我们贯穿全年的压倒一切的中心任务。为了完成这样繁难的任务，我们必须在所有环节上，展开紧张的准确的工作。我们要保证国家的收入，使经济建设、国防建设和社会文化建设的计划不致感受资金缺乏的影响。我们要在一切部门中，特别是在生产部门中，厉行节约，反对浪费。我们要在需要和可能的条件下充分地发掘生产的潜在力量，降低生产的成本，提高产品的数量和质量。我们要加强商业工作和运输交通工作，改善经营管理，加速工农业产品的流转和畅通城乡物资的交流，以供应人民的需要，稳定物价，并推动工农业生产的发展。我们要团结一切有益于国计民生的私营工商业者，使他们在国营经济领导和国家统一计划下面，发挥其应有的积极性。我们要认真地学习苏联先进经验，推广先进经验，组织广泛群众性的爱国主义的生产竞赛和节约运动，并在提高工农业生产水平的基础上，逐步地提高工农的生活水平。我们要使所有工作同志明了，我们面临着的是新的事物和新的任务，只有反对骄傲自满，虚心努力学习，改正错误缺点，才能克服困难，完成任务，并使自己易于熟悉业务和少犯错误。我们要加强国家的纪律，反对官僚主义和命令主义，制裁违法乱纪分子，严防坏分子的怠工和破坏。我们相信在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，在苏联先进技术和专家的帮助下，聪明勤劳的中国工人、农民和知识分子，必能发挥伟大的积极性和创造性，实现每一个具体的任务和具体的计划。
    第三、为了继续加强抗美援朝的力量，为了顺利实现国家的建设计划，我们要根据中央人民政府的决议，动员全国人民积极准备和参加全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的选举，实现进一步的民主化，以便充分地发挥全国人民的积极性，来共同奋斗。大家都知道，根据共同纲领和中央人民政府组织法的规定，我们三年多来所实行的由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权、由地方各界人民代表会议逐步代行地方各级人民代表大会职权的临时组织形式，就是为普选制的全国及地方各级人民代表大会准备条件的。现在，就全国范围来说，大陆上的军事行动早已完全结束，土地改革除少数地区外已经完成，各界人民已经组织起来，因此，依据共同纲领第十四条，召开普选制的全国及地方各级人民代表大会的条件是完全成熟了。事实上，三年多来，参加全国各地各界人民代表会议的代表共达一千三百六十三万七千多人，其中由人民直接选举或间接选举的已经逐渐增多，一般地区已经达到代表总数的百分之八十以上。全国有十九个省，八十五个市，四百三十六个县和二十八万多个乡（村）里面的大部份乡（村），已由各界人民代表会议或乡（村）农民代表会议选举出各该级的人民政府。这就足以证明，立即实行普选，是完全符合于我们人民民主发展的实际状况和全国人民的迫切要求的。虽然我们还是初次举行普选，准备工作需要相当时间，但是，由于我们全国人民的觉悟程度和组织程度已经大大地提高，并有了召开地方各级人民代表会议的经验；同时，目前又是首先从基层政权的人民代表大会开始采用直接选举制，所以，只要乡村和市区基层选举有充裕的准备时间，并将选举工作做好，县、省（市）两级人民代表大会代表的选举及其召开的时间是不需要相隔好久的，接着在这个基础上召开全国人民代表大会也就不困难了。全国的选举运动即将展开，我们应该在人民中广泛宣传中央人民政府这次决议的重大意义，动员人民认真地严肃地参加这次选举，以便把他们自己所认为满意的和认为必要的人选举出来，代表自己去参加国家政权的工作，负责管理国家的事务和地方的事务。
    在全国人民代表大会召开之后，作为中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式的中国人民政协，依据共同纲领的规定，仍应继续存在。但是，全国人民代表大会既已决定召开，则中国人民政协的第二届全体会议，依照共同纲领的规定，当然就无权再执行全国人民代表大会的职权。至于它今后的作用，毛泽东主席在一九五○年的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕辞中曾这样说过：
    “我们的国家就是这样地稳步前进，经过战争，经过新民主主义的改革，而在将来，在国家经济事业和文化事业大为兴盛了以后，在各种条件具备了以后，在全国人民考虑成熟并在大家同意了以后，就可以从容地和妥善地走进社会主义的新时期。……
    “在这个远大的目标上，在国外，我们必须坚固地团结苏联、各新民主国家及全世界一切和平民主力量，对此不可有丝毫的游移和动摇。在国内，我们必须团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体及一切爱国民主人士，必须巩固我们这个已经建立的伟大的有威信的革命统一战线。不论什么人，凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所贡献者，他就是正确的，我们就欢迎他；凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所损害者，他就是错误的，我们就反对他。”
    毛主席的这个指示，说明了对革命有过伟大贡献的人民民主统一战线，在今后必须继续发展和巩固。为适应目前这个新情势，共同纲领和政协组织法，都应准备作适当的和必要的修改。每个参加这一统一战线的单位，在工人阶级和中国共产党领导之下，今后必须认识自己的责任，分清敌友，辨别是非，团结一致，共同努力，为建设新民主主义国家并向着社会主义前进而奋斗。
    同志们！摆在我们面前的三项任务，是重大的，也是光荣的。我们有充分信心可以胜利地完成这些伟大而迫切的任务。过去的经验证明，中国人民在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导之下，是完全有力量能够取得伟大而光辉的胜利的。
    全国各民族各阶层人民，更加紧密地团结起来，高举着毛泽东的旗帜，满怀信心地向着更伟大、更光辉的胜利前进！
