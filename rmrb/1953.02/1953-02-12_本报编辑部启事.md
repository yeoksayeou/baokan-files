    Notice from the Editorial Department of This Newspaper
    Recently, the number of letters from readers to this newspaper has been increasing, and the number of important issues reflected in them has also been increasing. The original "Letters from Readers" column and "Letters from Readers Special Page" can no longer accommodate them, and they must be published in various sections to further enhance the role of letters from readers. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue the "Letters from Readers Special Page" from today onwards and publish major issues from readers' letters in various sections. At the same time, in order to reflect more criticisms and suggestions from readers in various regions and aspects, we have decided to change the "Letters from Readers" column to the "Abstracts of Letters from Readers" column, using abstracts to publish more readers' letters. We hope that readers from all regions will put forward more extensive and in-depth criticisms and suggestions on the country's various construction undertakings and various tasks.

    本报编辑部启事
    最近本报读者来信日渐增多，其中反映的重要问题也日渐增多，原有的“读者来信”栏和“读者来信专页”已经容纳不了，必须分别在各版刊登，更加发挥读者来信的作用。因此，我们决定从今日起停出“读者来信专页”，将读者来信中的重大问题分别刊登各版。同时为了更多地反映各地各方面读者的批评和建议，并决定将“读者来信”栏改为“读者来信摘要”栏，用摘要方式更多刊载读者来信。希望各地读者更广泛、更深入地提出对国家各项建设事业和各种工作的批评和建议。
