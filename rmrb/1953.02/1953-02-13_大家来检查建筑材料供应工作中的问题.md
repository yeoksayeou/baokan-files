    Editor's Note: On January 8th and January 20th, this newspaper published letters from readers criticizing the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Companies of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company for selling rotten timber. These two companies have made self-criticisms and sent them to this newspaper requesting publication. However, because readers from various locations continue to write exposing similar problems, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate is conducting in-depth investigations into these issues, the self-criticisms of these two companies will not be published for the time being. We hope they will conduct more thorough and comprehensive self-examinations and send their final self-criticism reports to this newspaper for publication.

    The Rotten Timber of the Beijing Municipal Company of the Coal Construction Company
    Seriously Damaged the Engineering Quality of Tsinghua and Other Schools

    Comrade Editor: The vast majority of timber used in the basic construction projects of Tsinghua, Peking, and Yenching Universities last year was purchased from the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, totaling approximately 8,000 cubic meters. Due to prolonged exposure to wind and rain, most of this timber was rotten, riddled with wormholes, and easily crumbled upon contact. We calculated that for 4,438 cubic meters of red pine, white pine, yellow flower pine, miscellaneous wood, square timber, and round timber, the average material yield (including all usable materials, even battens) was only slightly above 69%. The low quality of the timber damaged the lifespan of the buildings. The sheathing boards of our newly built civil engineering and metalworking workshop are full of wormholes and ant nests. Many doors and windows have rotten knots and scars, which had to be patched; some purlins broke in half with just two people bending them. During construction, workers were injured when scaffolding boards broke. The designed stress of the timber was originally 90 kilograms per square centimeter, but under these circumstances, it had to be reduced to 60 kilograms per square centimeter, thus increasing the cross-section. For example, the original design called for nine purlins per room, but now thirteen are needed. Our budget overrun this time was approximately 7.2 billion yuan, and one of the main reasons for this was the poor quality of the timber.

    In addition, the work style and management philosophy of the staff of the Beijing Municipal Company of the Coal Construction Company are also problematic. Their timber is transported from the Northeast, but they never use the Northeast's grading standards. Comrades engaged in basic construction at the People's University used timber of the same volume and calculated it according to the company's measuring method and the Northeast's measuring method. The former was about one-fifth more than the latter. When we raised objections to the company's measuring and grading, their staff refused to work, saying, "There's no way to do it," "The people from the Three Universities Construction Committee are hard to please," and so on. We believe that the Beijing Municipal Company of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company should carefully examine its work and actively study how to improve it.

    The Shanghai Municipal Company of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company's
    Storage and Supply of Timber is Extremely Chaotic

    Comrade Editor: In June and July of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company transferred a large quantity of timber from the Northeast. Because no preparations had been made in advance, they piled the timber haphazardly on unprepared ground. The soil in these areas was too loose, and they did not stack it off the ground as required by higher authorities. As a result, the timber sunk into the soil and rotted over time. Afterward, they did not handle it properly and irresponsibly transferred most of the rotten timber to Beijing, Qingdao, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, and other places. This January, three thousand bundles (one hundred pieces per bundle) of mud strip timber (used for interior ceilings) were transferred to our Suzhou Municipal Company, of which one hundred bundles were so rotten that they were not even good for firewood. Other materials such as fir squares and fir boards also had 2% to 3% rot. How can such timber be used for basic construction materials!

    The Suzhou Municipal Company refused to accept this batch of rotten timber and sent me to the Shanghai Municipal Company to negotiate. However, I could not find the person in charge of the company for a long time after arriving in Shanghai. I finally found Jiang Zuoyi, the head of the storage and transportation section, on the morning of January 23rd. I said to him, "How should the rotten timber that has already been transported be handled? If you transfer such rotten timber again, we will resolutely refuse to accept it; you should pay attention to stacking methods and storage dates when storing it." Director Jiang's reply was: "The past rotten timber will be handled according to the instructions of higher authorities; when transferring timber again, please ask the people from the East China Regional Company to take a look, and if they think it can be transferred, then transfer it; we ourselves do not know how much timber is in stock, there is no way to manage it, even if we are punished, there is nothing we can do."

    I believe that Comrade Jiang Zuoyi, as the leading cadre of the storage and transportation section, does not actively try to improve his work and recover the loss of state wealth, but instead adopts a passive attitude, which is intolerable.

    In addition, the company's work system is extremely chaotic. In November and December of last year, 2,600 cubic meters of timber were transferred to our Suzhou Municipal Company, of which the square timber exceeded the delivery note by 23.631 cubic meters. Another type of 3-inch and 6-inch square timber was short by 3,000 pieces compared to the shipping manifest, but according to the timber volume scale, it was 500 pieces more. This made our receiving staff unsure of how to sign the shipping manifest. We wrote two letters to the Shanghai Municipal Company, but there was no reply for a long time. At the end of December last year, our company sent me to Shanghai to verify, and found that Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing, and other places also had discrepancies.

    As I understand it, the company is responsible for supplying round timber to various construction companies in Shanghai. Last year, for a period of time, it was said that the supply was not available, so square timber was used instead. However, the company clearly had a large quantity of round timber in its warehouse. This has caused the state to lose hundreds of millions of yuan.

    People have repeatedly criticized the company for these serious problems, but they have not paid attention to them. I believe that the supervisory authorities in Shanghai should investigate and handle this matter. Yu Houcheng

    Timber Supply and Marketing Units Fail to Fulfill Original Contracts
    Harbin Plywood Factory Suffers Losses

    Comrade Editor: The Harbin Plywood Factory has recently experienced serious production cuts, waste, and product backlogs due to the failure of local timber supply and marketing units to fulfill contracts. The normal production volume of the factory is approximately 6,000 square feet of plywood per day. However, from January 3rd to 8th this year, it only produced 7,000 square feet in six days, and the quality was reduced, with no premium products; the timber utilization rate also decreased from 43% to 20%. The reason for this serious waste is that the timber supply department neither values the state plan nor fulfills the contract signed with the factory, and instead allocates a large number of substandard third-grade materials to the factory. When the factory raises objections, the timber supply department ignores them.

    The factory also faces the problem of disconnection between production and sales. The factory currently has 253,668 square meters of plywood and 1,944 cubic meters of unqualified logs in stock. This has tied up a large amount of capital, so that the factory could not even pay its employees' salaries in January. The reason for this situation is that the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Harbin Municipal Company, which signed a sales contract with the factory, is restructuring its organization and its business is at a standstill. However, they do not allow the factory to sell the backlog of products on its own, creating a situation of "contracting but not selling." The Coal Industry Building Materials Company also does not allow the factory to sell unqualified timber. Their purchase prices are very unfair. In order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, the state's supply and marketing departments should quickly correct the above-mentioned serious shortcomings. He Guangyu

    大家来检查建筑材料供应工作中的问题
    编者按：一月八日、一月二十日本报先后发表了读者批评中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司、天津市公司不该出售腐朽木材的来信。这两个公司对此已作检讨，并将检讨寄给本报要求在报上刊登。但因为各地读者还继续来信揭露类似问题，而最高人民检察署也正在深入检查这些问题，故这两个公司的检讨现在暂不发表。希望他们深入、全面地再作检查，将最后的检讨报告寄给本报发表。
    煤建公司北京市公司的腐朽木材
    严重损害了清华等校的工程质量
    编辑同志：去年清华、北京、燕京大学三校基本建设工程所用的木材极大部分是从中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司买来的，总数约八千立方公尺。这些木材因长期受风雨侵蚀，大部分已经腐朽，满身虫眼，一碰就碎。我们计算了一下，红白松、黄花松、杂木和方、元木等四千四百三十八立方公尺，平均出材率（包括一切可用的材料，连龙骨瓦条在内）仅百分之六十九强。木材质量低，就损害了建筑物的寿命。我们新建的土木金工间，望板满身是虫眼及蚂蚁蛸。许多门窗有腐朽节疤，不得不补上一块；有的房檩两人一折即断。施工时曾因脚手板断了摔伤过工人。木材的设计应力原为每平方公分九十公斤，但在这样情况下被迫降至每平方公分六十公斤，因而断面要加大。如原设计每个房间用九根檩子，现在要用十三根。这次我们的预算超支约七十二亿元，其主要原因之一就是木材的质量低劣。
    此外，煤建公司北京市公司的工作人员的作风和经营思想也是有问题的。他们的木材是从东北运来的，但从来不用东北的等级标准。人民大学搞基本建设的同志用同样体积的木材，分别按该公司的检尺法和东北的检尺法计算，比较起来前者比后者约多算五分之一。当我们对该公司的检尺和等级提出意见时，他们的工作人员就不工作了，说：“没法做”、“三校建委会的人不好伺候”等等。我们认为煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司应该很好地检查自己的工作，并积极研究怎样改进自己的工作。
    清华、北京、燕京大学三校调整建筑计划委员会
    煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司
    保管和供应木材工作极为混乱
    编辑同志：去年六、七月间，中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司从东北调入大批木材，因事先没有作好准备，就把这批木材乱七八糟地堆存在没有压制的场地上。这些场地泥土太松，他们又没有按照上级的规定架空堆置，以致木材堆存日久陷入土中而霉烂，事后他们也不作妥善处理，就把这批大部分腐朽的木材不负责任地调往北京、青岛、南京、镇江、常州、无锡、苏州、常熟等地。今年一月份调到我们苏州市公司的三千捆（每捆一百根）泥幔条木（做室内平顶用），其中一百捆已经腐烂到连烧火也不顶事。其他如杉方、杉板也有百分之二到百分之三是腐朽的。这样的木材怎能充基本建设材料呢！
    苏州市公司不肯接受这批腐朽木材，派我到上海市公司交涉。但我到上海后长期找不到该公司的负责人。等到一月二十三日早晨找到储运科科长姜作义。我对他说：“已经运去的腐朽木材如何处理？如果今后再调这样的朽木我们坚决不收；你们保管时应该注意堆置方法和储存日期。”姜科长的答复是：“过去的腐朽木材听候上级处理；再调木材时请华东区公司的人来看，他们认为可调就调；我们自己也不知道木材库存多少，没有办法管，就是受处分也没办法。”
    我认为姜作义同志身为储运科的领导干部，不积极想办法改进工作，挽回国家财富的损失，反而采取消极态度，这是不能令人容忍的。
    此外，该公司工作制度极为混乱。去年十一、十二两月中，调到我们苏州市公司二千六百立方公尺木材，其中方木比发货单多发了二十三点六三一立方公尺，另有一种三吋、六吋方木，却较运送单少三千块，若按照木材体积尺数验收又多五百块。搞得我们收货员不知怎样签回运送单。我们连写两封信给上海市公司，但久无回音。去年十二月底我们公司派我去上海核对，发现无锡、常州、南京等地也都有差错。
    据我了解，该公司负责供应上海市各建筑公司的元木，去年有一段时间说是供应不上了，就拿方木代替。但是该公司库里却明明存有大批元木。这样就使国家损失了数亿元。
    对于以上这些严重的问题，不断有人向该公司提过批评，但并没有引起他们的重视。我认为上海市的监察机关应该查明并处理这件事。   尤後承
    木材供销单位不履行原签订合同
    哈尔滨胶合板工厂生产受到损失
    编辑同志：哈尔滨胶合板工厂最近因为当地木材供销单位不执行合同，发生了严重的减产、浪费和积压产品等现象。该厂正常生产量是每天产胶合板约六千平方尺。但今年一月三日至八日六天中，只生产七千平方尺，而且质量降低了，没有特等产品；木材利用率也由百分之四十三降低到百分之二十。造成这样严重浪费的原因，是木材供应部门既不重视国家计划，又不履行和该厂签订的合同，拨给该厂大批不合规格的三等材。该厂提出意见时，木材供应部门也不理会。
    该厂目前还存在着产销脱节问题。该厂现存胶合板二十五万三千六百六十八平方公尺，不合格的原木一千九百四十四立方公尺。这就积压了大量的资金，以致一月份该厂连职工的工资都发不出去。造成这种情况的原因是：和该厂订包销合同的中国煤业建筑器材公司哈尔滨市公司正在改组机构，业务陷于停顿，可是他们又不许工厂自己把积压的产品往外推销，形成“包而不销”的现象。对于不合规格的木材，煤业建筑器材公司也不许工厂出售。而他们的收购价格却十分不公平。为了适应大规模经济建设的需要，国家的供销部门应该迅速纠正以上严重的缺点。　何光裕
