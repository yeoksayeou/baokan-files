Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: The laboring people of China and the Soviet Union frequently correspond with each other, expressing their deep friendship. According to TASS, miners at the No. 29 mine of the Stalin Coal Mine in Donbas, USSR, recently received a letter from coal miners in Shandong Province, China. The letter expressed admiration for the great achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of Stalin and also talked about how the laboring people of New China are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to build a new life. They hope to correspond with the Donbas miners frequently and hope that the Donbas miners will share their advanced experiences with them. After a heated discussion of the letter, the miners and engineers of this Donbas mine wrote a reply. The reply stated that they would work hard to strengthen their friendship with the miners of great China and detailed the advanced experiences of the Donbas mines, such as the use of assembly-line operations. The letter mentioned their recent production achievements, stating that they had exceeded their plan by mining more than 2,000 tons of coking coal in January.

Construction workers at the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, one of the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union, recently received a letter from employees of a power station in Zhejiang Province, China. The letter described the many achievements they had made by mastering Soviet work methods. They said, "Our slogan is to learn from the Soviet Union. Please tell us about your advanced experience and correspond with us." The construction workers at the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station elected the youth team of the best dredging machine named after the Soviet hero Matrosov to reply to their Chinese friends. This Stakhanovite team shared their experiences in participating in the Volga-Don Canal construction project and working on the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station site with the power station workers in Zhejiang. The letter also stated, "The members of our team tirelessly improve our skills and knowledge, which is helpful for our daily work. In our spare time, we read Soviet, Chinese, and other countries' classical literature and modern excellent literary books. We also watch plays, listen to music, and watch movies in the workers' club. We Kuibyshev Hydropower Station workers are deeply moved by the stories of the Chinese films 'Steel Fighter', 'The White-Haired Girl', and 'New Children's Heroes'."

Not long ago, the Stalin Collective Farm in the Kuban region (Editor's note: This is the collective farm introduced in the Soviet film "Happy Life") received a letter from farmers in Lipu County, Guangxi Province, China. The letter said, "Our model worker, Jiang Zaiqiu, participated in the Chinese farmers' delegation to visit the Soviet Union last year and was warmly welcomed by all the farmers of your collective farm. He studied your patriotic labor and gave us a report after returning to China, which made a deep impression on us and the farmers in neighboring counties. Everyone warmly praised your great victory and happy life. Your advanced workers and labor heroes are our role models. We have been inspired by the great achievements of the Soviet people." The farmers of the Stalin Collective Farm have written a reply, detailing their life and labor achievements.

    中苏两国劳动人民互相通信
    表达中苏友谊并畅谈建设新生活的情况
    【新华社十二日讯】中苏两国劳动人民经常互相通讯，表达他们深厚的友谊。据塔斯社消息：苏联顿巴斯斯大林煤场第二十九矿坑的矿工，在不久前接到中国山东省的煤矿工人的来信。信中对苏联人民在斯大林领导下获得的巨大成就表示钦佩，还谈到了新中国劳动人民学习苏联先进经验建设新生活的情况。他们希望经常和顿巴斯矿工通信，并希望顿巴斯矿工把先进经验告诉他们。顿巴斯这个矿坑的矿工和工程师们热烈地讨论了这封信之后，写了一封回信。回信中表示他们要努力加强和伟大中国的矿工的友谊，并详细介绍了顿巴斯各矿场使用的流水作业法等先进经验。信上谈到他们最近的生产成就，他们在一月份已超过计划多开采了二千多吨炼焦用煤。
    苏联伟大共产主义建设工程之一——古比雪夫水电站的建筑工人最近接到中国浙江省一个电力站的职工的来信。信中叙述他们由于掌握了苏联的工作方法而获得了许多成就。他们说，我们的口号是向苏联学习，请把你们的先进经验告诉我们，请和我们通信。古比雪夫水电站的建筑工人们推选以苏联英雄马特洛索夫的名字为名的最优秀的汲泥机青年小组复信给中国朋友。这个小组的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者，把他们参加伏尔加河—顿河运河建设工程和在古比雪夫水电站工地工作中所积累的经验，告诉给浙江的电力站工人们。信上还写道，我们这个小组的组员不倦地提高我们的技术和知识，这对我们每天的工作都是有帮助的。我们有空的时候，就阅读苏联、中国和其他国家的古典文学作品和现代优秀的文艺书籍。我们还在工人俱乐部中看戏、听音乐和看电影。我们古比雪夫水电站的工人，都深为中国影片“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“新儿女英雄传”的故事所感动。
    不久以前，库班区斯大林集体农庄（编者按：即苏联影片“幸福的生活”所介绍的集体农庄）接到了中国广西省荔浦县农民的一封信。信中说，我们的模范工作者蒋在球去年参加中国农民代表参观团到苏联访问，受到了你们集体农庄所有农民的热烈欢迎。他研究了你们的爱国主义劳动，回国后给我们作了报告，使我们及邻县的农民获得很深刻的印象。大家都热烈赞美你们的伟大胜利和幸福生活。你们的先进工作者和劳动英雄是我们的榜样。我们从苏联人民的伟大成就中得到了鼓舞。斯大林集体农庄的农民已写了一封回信，详细叙述他们的生活和劳动成就。
