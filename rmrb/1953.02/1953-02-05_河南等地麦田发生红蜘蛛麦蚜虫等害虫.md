Wheat fields in Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces have successively experienced infestations of red spiders and other pests. In Meng County, Henan, 41,000 mu of wheat fields were widely infested with red spiders as early as the end of November last year. In severe cases, there were more than a dozen insects per wheat seedling. Irrigated land was more severely affected, while dry land was less affected. Red spiders are afraid of the cold and hide in the roots of wheat or in the soil in the morning and evening, climbing onto the wheat seedlings at noon to suck the juice from the wheat leaves. Most of the affected wheat seedlings turn from green to yellow, and a small number of severely affected seedlings have already withered. In addition, a large number of overwintering wheat midges have also been found in some wheat fields in this county.

When the Yuncheng Special District Plant Disease and Pest Control Station in Shanxi Province inspected the wheat fields near the station at the end of last year, they found that some wheat seedlings had overwintering wheat aphids hidden in their roots.

The weather is still cold, and red spiders and other wheat pests are mostly clustered around the roots. These pests are very small, and it is not easy to detect them without careful inspection. Therefore, all localities should be vigilant, conduct careful inspections, and take preventive measures as early as possible.

    河南等地麦田发生红蜘蛛麦蚜虫等害虫
    河南、山东、江苏和陕西等地的冬小麦田中，相继发生红蜘蛛等害虫，河南孟县的四万一千亩麦田，在去年十一月底就普遍发生了红蜘蛛，严重的每株麦苗上有虫十数个。水浇地受害较重，旱地受害较轻。红蜘蛛怕冷，早晚在麦根或土壤中潜伏，中午爬到麦苗上吮吸麦叶的汁液。被害的麦苗，多数由绿变黄，少数严重的已经枯萎。此外这个县的部分麦田中，并且发现了大量的越冬小麦吸浆虫。
    山西运城专区病虫害防治站在去年底在该站附近麦田中进行检查时，发现有的麦苗根部藏有越冬的麦蚜虫。
    目前气候还冷，红蜘蛛等小麦害虫多猬集根部；这种害虫身体很小，如果不仔细检查，就不容易察觉。因此各地应提高警惕，认真检查，及早防治。
