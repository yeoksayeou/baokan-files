Xinhua News Agency, February 11th—The Beijing Workers' Daily today published an editorial entitled "Implement the Resolutions of the Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Sixth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Actively Prepare for the Seventh National Labor Congress." After detailing the achievements of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the principal errors made by the ACFTU in its leadership, the editorial stated: "This year, our country has officially entered a period of planned large-scale construction. As the mass organization of the working class—the leading class of the country—the trade union has even greater tasks in such a great historical period. In order to summarize four years of experience, stipulate the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work during the period of national construction, further give play to the role of trade union organizations in national construction, and mobilize the national working class to ensure the completion of the national construction tasks, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee has decided to convene the Seventh National Labor Congress on May 2nd this year, which is timely. Our worker comrades nationwide and trade union cadres at all levels must now mobilize to actively prepare for this historically significant Seventh National Labor Congress."

Regarding how to prepare for the Seventh National Labor Congress, the editorial called on workers nationwide and trade union organizations at all levels to do the following:

(1) First, we must strengthen the ideological construction of trade unions, implement the resolutions of the ACFTU Executive Committee's Enlarged Meeting, and launch a study movement among trade union cadres and activists nationwide, combined with a review of the work of the past four years, clarify the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work as instructed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, eliminate the syndicalist ideological tendencies that exist to varying degrees among some trade union cadres, correct the style of trade union work, and resolutely, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, further put the national trade union work on the right track.

(2) From now on, worker comrades nationwide and trade union organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and based on the specific conditions of each region and enterprise, discuss the production or engineering plans of the factory, mine, or construction site, establish workshop and team plans and covenants, link contracts, launch patriotic labor emulation campaigns, ensure the completion of the state's production plan and basic construction plan, and implement economic accounting systems.

(3) When conducting studies on the issues of trade union guidelines, tasks, and roles, trade union organizations at all levels, in addition to reviewing their own work, should also continue to study the experience of Factory 53. The experience of Factory 53 is the concrete experience of implementing the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on trade union work. Seriously and carefully studying the experience of Factory 53, combined with the study of the documents issued by the ACFTU Executive Committee's Enlarged Meeting, will enable us to more deeply appreciate the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. This is an important link in implementing the resolutions of the ACFTU Executive Committee's Enlarged Meeting and improving and enhancing trade union work.

(4) From now on, trade union organizations at all levels must, in accordance with the resolutions of the ACFTU Executive Committee's Enlarged Meeting, actively, systematically, and step-by-step arrange the preparatory work for the Seventh National Labor Congress. Combining theory with practice, studying documents, reviewing work, summarizing experiences, clarifying ideas, and mobilizing and organizing the broad masses for labor emulation to ensure the completion of the national plan is the central link in this preparatory work. Only by grasping and doing a good job of this central link can the other preparatory work for the Seventh National Labor Congress be done well. This is a major task of historical significance for current trade union work.

    北京工人日报发表社论号召全国工人
    贯彻全国总工会执委扩大会决议
    积极迎接第七次全国劳动大会
    【新华社十一日讯】北京工人日报今日发表题为“贯彻全国总工会六届二次执委扩大会议的决议积极迎接第七次全国劳动大会”的社论。社论在详细地说明中华全国总工会的工作成绩和全总在领导方面曾经犯过的原则性的错误之后说：“今年，我们的国家已经正式进入有计划的大规模的建设时期。作为国家领导阶级的工人阶级的群众组织——工会，在这样一个伟大历史时期的任务是更加重大了。为了总结四年的经验，规定国家建设时期工会工作的方针任务，进一步发挥工会组织在国家建设中的作用，动员全国工人阶级起来保证完成国家的建设任务，全国总工会执委扩大会决定在今年五月二日召开第七次全国劳动大会是适合时宜的。我们全国工人同志和各级工会干部，从现在起就要动员起来，积极迎接这一具有历史意义的第七次全国劳动大会”。
    关于怎样迎接第七次全国劳动大会，社论号召全国工人和各级工会组织，作好以下几项工作：
    （一）首先要加强工会的思想建设，贯彻全总这次执委扩大会议的决议，在全国工会干部和工会积极分子中，结合检查四年来的工作，展开一次学习运动，明确毛主席和党中央所指示我们的工会工作的方针任务，肃清在有些工会干部中或多或少存在着的工联主义的思想倾向，端正工会工作的作风，坚决在毛主席和共产党的领导下，把全国工会工作进一步地纳入正轨。
    （二）从现在起，全国工人同志和各级工会组织，就应在当地党委的统一领导下，根据各地区各企业的具体情况，讨论本厂、矿、工地的生产或工程计划，订立车间、小组计划和公约、联系合同，开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动，保证完成国家的生产计划和基本建设计划，贯彻经济核算制。
    （三）各级工会组织在进行关于工会的方针、任务与作用问题的学习时，除掉要结合检查自己的工作以外，同时还要继续学习五三工厂的经验。五三工厂的经验，就是贯彻了毛主席和党中央关于工会工作的指示的具体经验。认真地、仔细地学习五三工厂的经验，结合全总这次执委扩大会议所发的文件的学习，就更能深刻地体会毛主席和党中央的指示，这是贯彻全总执委扩大会议的决议，改进和提高工会工作的重要环节。
    （四）各级工会组织从现在起，就要按照全总这次执委扩大会议的决议，积极地、有计划、有步骤地布置有关第七次全国劳动大会的准备工作。而结合实际，学习文件，检查工作，总结经验，澄清思想，把广大群众为保证完成国家计划的劳动竞赛发动和组织起来，则是这一准备工作的中心一环。只有把这中心一环抓住了，做好了，迎接第七次全国劳动大会的其他准备工作才能做好。这是当前工会工作具有历史意义的一项重大任务。
