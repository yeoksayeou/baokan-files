    Support the Government Administration Council's Measures for Paying Off Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions
    Today, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government announced the "Measures for Paying Off Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions" and the "Measures for Registering Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions," stipulating that all state-owned, joint state-private, and private financial institutions, as well as foreign banks, shall repay outstanding pre-liberation deposits according to a certain ratio. This once again demonstrates that the People's Government is always concerned about the interests of the people of all strata.
    Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government implemented a policy of malignant inflation in order to plunder and loot the people's wealth. From 1937 to 1948, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas rose more than 1.2 million times, effectively wiping out the savings of China's middle and small bourgeoisie in banks in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time. On the eve of national liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government stole all the assets of the banks, finally dashing the hopes of depositors to recover their savings. According to statistics, more than one million households were victimized. Of course, the People's Government has no obligation to repay this debt left by the Kuomintang reactionary government. However, the People's Government, considering that the deposit issue is related to the vital interests of nearly ten million people, and that the small depositors, who account for 80 percent of all depositors, mostly deposit their hard-earned savings; and that many of them need to use their savings to subsidize living expenses, old age, illness, death, and the education of their children. Therefore, under the condition that the state's financial situation permits, the People's Government immediately decided to appropriately and reasonably resolve this issue. This is essentially a relief measure by the People's Government for depositors who suffered from the Kuomintang reactionary government's疯狂 plunder. It will be warmly supported by the vast number of depositors.
    The "Measures for Paying Off Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions" stipulates that deposits shall be repaid according to a progressive reduction in the proportion of the deposit amount; deposits before 1948 shall be converted at the current highest exchange rate for silver dollars. This is in line with the principle of general care, but focuses on resolving the difficulties of the majority, and takes into account the interests of the state, depositors, and private banks.
    Before liberation, 80 percent of bank deposits were concentrated in the so-called national and local provincial and municipal banks of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Since the Kuomintang reactionary government stole all the deposits when it fled, the People's Government must bear the burden of repaying this large portion of the deposits from our national treasury today. When implementing the repayment, specific and feasible measures should be stipulated according to the actual situation.
    The measures announced by the Government Administration Council now are reasonable and feasible because they are based on the actual situation. According to these measures, we should differentiate between the different situations of depositors and give them different care. Among all depositors, those with deposit amounts below "Legal Tender" 200 yuan account for 80 percent. They have less savings and need money most urgently. Therefore, they should be given more consideration and repaid at a rate of 100 percent. Under normal circumstances, the more depositors save, the smaller their living difficulties. Although the repayment rate they receive is lower than that of small depositors, the amount they receive is more than that of small depositors, which appropriately satisfies their demands. The deposits absorbed by private banks before liberation also suffered significant losses due to the malignant inflation of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Therefore, it is certainly not appropriate to force them to fully repay pre-liberation deposits. Therefore, converting deposits at the current silver dollar exchange rate and having private banks and depositors share the losses caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government is also very reasonable.
        The "Measures for Paying Off Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions" gives special consideration to overseas Chinese. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the vast number of overseas Chinese, driven by their patriotic enthusiasm, enthusiastically remitted money to the country, but the Kuomintang reactionary government withheld a large number of overseas remittances and did not pay them out at all. This caused huge losses to overseas Chinese and caused great difficulties to the families of overseas Chinese. Now the People's Government is repaying these overseas remittances according to the standard of time deposits, which will enable overseas Chinese to further understand and love their great motherland.
    In order to encourage savings and to avoid a large amount of funds entering the market at the same time, the "Measures for Paying Off Outstanding Deposits from Pre-Liberation Banks and Financial Institutions" stipulates that depositors with deposit amounts below "Legal Tender" 200 yuan will be paid in cash; those exceeding 200 yuan will be paid in cash for the base amount of 200 yuan, and the excess portion will be used as fixed-term savings for six months or one year, with interest paid according to regulations. This provision is both beneficial to the state and beneficial to depositors, and should be resolutely implemented.
    We hope that state-owned, joint state-private, and private banks in all regions will earnestly implement the decision of the Government Administration Council and completely resolve this issue left over by the Kuomintang reactionary government, which has been suspended for more than ten years without resolution. We hope that all depositors will properly use the deposits they receive and use them for production and other legitimate purposes. If there is any surplus, they can also carry out patriotic savings.

### 拥护政务院关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法

    拥护政务院关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法
    今天中央人民政府政务院公布了“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”和“解放前银钱业未清偿存款登记办法”，规定各国营、公私合营、私营金融业和外商银行，按照一定比率，偿付解放前尚未清偿的存款。这又一次说明了人民政府时时刻刻关怀着各阶层人民的利益。
    解放以前，国民党反动政府为了搜括和掠夺人民的财富，实施恶性通货膨胀的政策。从一九三七年起到一九四八年的那个期间，国民党统治区的物价上涨了一百二十多万倍，这就把我国中、小资产者当时在国民党统治区的银行存款实际上掠夺净尽了。在全国解放的前夕，国民党反动政府又把银行资财盗窃一空，使存款户取回存款的希望最后破灭。据统计，受害者达一百多万户。国民党反动政府遗留的这笔债务，人民政府当然没有清偿的义务。但是，人民政府鉴于存款问题关系到近一千万人的切身利益，而占存款户百分之八十的小额存户大多数又是以劳动所得的积蓄来存款的；他们之中，又有不少人需要以存款来补助生、老、病、死和子女教养的费用。因此，在国家财政情况允许的条件下，人民政府立即决定适当地、合情合理地解决这个问题。这实质上是人民政府对于遭受国民党反动政府疯狂掠夺的存款户进行救济。它将获得广大存款户的热烈拥护。
    “解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”中规定，按照存款金额比例递减的办法偿付存款；在一九四八年以前的存款，一律按照目前银元最高牌价折算。这是符合于一般照顾、但着重解决多数人的困难、并兼顾国家、存款户、私营行庄利益的原则的。
    银行在解放以前的存款，百分之八十集中于国民党反动政府的所谓国家行局及地方性省市银行中。国民党反动政府既经把所有存款在逃跑时盗窃一空，因而，人民政府今天来清偿这一大部分存款，必须由我们的国家财政来负担。在实行清偿的时候，应根据实际情况，规定合理可行的具体办法。
    现在政务院公布的办法，所以是合理的可行的，就因为它是根据实际情况规定的。按照这个办法，我们对于存款户的不同情况应加以分别，给以不同的照顾。在全部存款户中，存款金额在“法币”二百元以下者占百分之八十，他们存款较少而需钱最急，因此，应该多予照顾，按百分之百的比率予以偿付；而在一般情况下，存户存款越多，生活上的困难越小，他们获得偿付的比率虽较小额存户为低，所得款额却较小额存户为多，这就适当地满足了他们的要求；私营行庄在解放前吸收的存款，同样因为国民党反动政府恶性通货膨胀的影响，遭受了重大的损失，现在当然也不应该强使它们十足偿付解放前的存款，因此，按照目前银元牌价折算存款，由私营行庄和存款户双方分担国民党反动政府所造成的损失，这也是十分合情合理的。
        “解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”对海外侨胞给以特别的照顾。在抗日战争期间，广大侨胞激于爱国保家的热情，踊跃向国内汇款，但国民党反动政府把大批侨汇扣押起来，根本不予解付。这给海外侨胞造成了巨大损失，使广大侨眷遭受极大的困难。现在人民政府按照定期存款标准清偿这些侨汇，这将使海外侨胞进一步认识和热爱自己伟大的祖国。
    为了奖励储蓄，为了避免大量资金同时投入市场，“解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”规定，存款额在“法币”二百元以下者，一律给付现金；超过二百元者，除二百元基数给付现金外，其超过部分分别作为六个月或一年的定期定额储蓄，并照章付息。这个规定既有利于国家，又有利于存款户，应该坚决加以执行。
    我们希望各地国营、公私合营和私营的银行，一致认真地来执行政务院的决定，彻底解决这个由国民党反动政府遗留下来的、悬搁了十几年没有解决的问题。我们希望所有的存款户妥善地使用自己领取的存款，把它用到生产和其他正当的用途上去，如有剩余，还可以进行爱国储蓄。
