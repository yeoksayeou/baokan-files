Senior cadres of units directly under the Central Military Commission, from around November 20th of last year to January 10th of this year, completed their study of Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the first and third parts of Malenkov's report; they have now moved on to studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

The scale of this study was larger than any previous one, with a total of over 1,600 cadres participating, divided into 30 central study groups and more than 160 ordinary study groups. The Central Military Commission's central study group was headed by Acting Chief of General Staff Nie Rongzhen, with Deputy Director of the General Political Department Xiao Hua and others as deputy heads. The central study groups of each unit were also headed by the main responsible comrades. Each unit adhered to a system of two and a half days of collective study per week. The vast majority of units ensured that office work, meetings, phone calls, and visitors did not interfere with study time. Even when certain departments convened army-wide conferences, they did not interrupt the study. Those who took leave due to special circumstances were able to automatically make up for missed study time. For example, one unit which had its study time occupied one afternoon by a meeting made up for it the next afternoon, and also absorbed cadres from various places who had come to Beijing for the meeting to participate in the study. During the study, leading comrades of all units were able to lead by example and actively participate in the study, such as Deputy Political Commissar of the Navy Liu Daosheng, who actively participated in and led the study from beginning to end; Minister Li Tao of a certain department participated in every study session and gave everyone learning focal points, and answered difficult problems. Some units also held study quizzes, in which the main responsible comrades automatically participated, with no one absent. Deputy Political Commissar Xiang Zhonghua of a certain department personally checked the study notes of the central group. In terms of organizational leadership, the General Political Department and the General Party Committee directly under the Central Military Commission closely monitored the central groups, reporting once a week, and issuing a study bulletin; the central groups then led the ordinary groups in their studies, and promptly inspected, promptly reported commendations and criticisms, and exchanged experiences. This has greatly promoted the study.

Through this stage of study, they generally felt that their political horizons had been broadened, and that they had a deeper understanding of the basic characteristics and main contradictions of the current international situation; in particular, they had a new understanding and appreciation of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and the significance and purpose of the current peace and democracy movement, thereby further recognizing the tasks of struggle facing our army, boosting morale, and increasing confidence in victory. Many comrades said: From this study, they gained a clearer understanding of the strength and development prospects of the peace and democracy camp, and their thinking became more open. Some comrades said: "After studying Malenkov's report, it is as if we have personally witnessed the prosperity of the forces of peace and democracy, which has greatly enhanced our confidence in safeguarding the victory of the motherland's large-scale economic construction."

During the study, all units paid attention to linking with the reality of their thinking and work, studied the main problems existing in their units, and appropriately solved some problems. For example, a certain department of the Central Military Commission studied the work and ideological situation of its department based on the spirit of the documents, made a more realistic assessment of the future direction and scale of development of the department's work, and determined the focus of ideological education for this year. After studying the third part of Malenkov's report, many units unanimously recognized that carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, is a powerful weapon for promoting work, and thus conscientiously examined their work in accordance with the spirit of the documents, discovering many serious shortcomings. Everyone reflected: This study is truly a great inspiration for improving our leadership methods, working methods, and improving the ideological level and work efficiency of cadres. Other units closely combined this study with the democratic inspection of the Party committee, overcoming some existing bureaucratic work styles. Many comrades said: Studying the "Party" section is like injecting a tonic into me, which has made me further realize the harm of bureaucracy, and without this study, my bureaucratic work style would have developed further. A department of the Central Military Commission has already formulated concrete measures to overcome bureaucracy.

Through this study, on the issue of cadre policy, some comrades' erroneous understanding of emphasizing talent over virtue or neglecting virtue and talent while emphasizing seniority was corrected, and at the same time, vigilance was raised against the bad habit of understanding cadres only on the basis of appraisal forms and resumes.

What is particularly important is that through this study, the importance of theoretical study has been further recognized, the interest and consciousness of cadres in studying theory have been improved, and study habits have been initially cultivated. The general reflection was: "This study is of great help to work," "We understood too little in the past," "We urgently need to study," and expressed "We must persevere." This has laid a good foundation for further theoretical study. In addition, the general comrades have also gained a further understanding of the importance of strengthening ideological work and strengthening the unity and unification of the Party.

The experience of this stage of study proves that the study system for senior cadres in the army can be maintained. But to do this, first of all, the main leading cadres at all levels must lead by example, personally take the lead in studying, and conscientiously lead the study of cadres in their subordinate units, taking leadership of the study as one of the main contents of their work; strictly grasp the study system, closely supervise and inspect at all levels in a timely manner, commend the good, and criticize the bad. In particular, establishing a "Study Day" system to ensure study time is extremely important. In order to avoid affecting the study due to busy work, it is also necessary to simultaneously strengthen the planning and discipline of the work of the organs, and continuously improve work methods and improve work efficiency. Facts have proved that as long as the planning and discipline of work are strengthened, study time can indeed be guaranteed. This is an important factor in whether the study of senior cadres can be organized and maintained.

Secondly, it is necessary to guide cadres to correctly connect with reality, and to allow those who are studying to personally experience the effects of the study as much as possible, in order to enhance the consciousness and initiative of the study. The method of connecting with reality must be: fully understanding the spirit and essence of the documents, connecting with and solving some of the main problems in the work and thinking of the department or individual, rather than connecting in a general and unfocused way. Only in this way can the study not go astray.

Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen study guidance. Especially at present, when studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," because the content of the document is more profound, and some cadres do not have enough basic knowledge of political economy, it is not easy to understand. Therefore, the theoretical guidance of the central groups will be even more important in the future, and it is necessary to plan to have comrades with higher levels of political theory study ahead of others, and give everyone guidance and enlightenment in theory. The study should emphasize repeatedly reading Comrade Stalin's original text, and then supplementing it with some necessary reference materials; otherwise, getting too entangled in the reference documents will inevitably affect the effect of the study.

    中央军委直属单位的高级干部学习联共第十九次代表大会文件有收获
    中央军委直属各单位的高级干部从去年十一月二十日前后至今年一月十日，学完了斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说和马林科夫报告的第一、三部分；目前已转入“苏联社会主义经济问题”的学习。
    这次学习的规模比以往任何一次都大，参加学习的干部共一千六百余人，分别编成三十个中心小组，一百六十余个普通小组。军委中心小组由聂荣臻代总参谋长任组长，总政治部萧华副主任等任副组长。各单位中心组也都是由主要负责同志担任组长。各单位均坚持了每周两个半日的集体学习制度。绝大多数单位做到了学习时间不办公、不开会、不打电话、不会客。某些部门曾召开全军性的会议，都未间断过学习。如因特殊事故请假者，也能做到自动抽时间补学。如某单位因开会占用了一个下午的学习时间，第二天即补学了一个下午，并吸收各地来京开会的干部参加学习。在学习中，各单位领导同志均能以身作则带头学习，如海军刘道生副政委，自始至终都积极参加学习并领导学习；某部李涛部长每次学习均参加；并给大家提出学习重点，解答疑难问题。还有些单位举行学习测验时，主要负责同志均能自动参加，无一缺席。某部向仲华副政委曾亲自检查中心组的学习笔记。这次学习，在组织领导上，由总政治部及军委直属总党委抓紧各中心组，每周汇报一次，并出学习简报一期；各中心组则领导各普通组学习，并及时检查、及时通报表扬批评，交流经验。这样做对学习起了很大的推动作用。
    经过这一阶段的学习，普遍感到扩大了政治眼界，进一步认识了当前国际形势的基本特点和主要矛盾；特别对于苏联的和平政策以及当前和平民主运动的意义与目的等，都有了新的了解和体会，从而更加认识到了摆在我军面前的斗争任务，鼓舞了斗志，增强了胜利的信心。许多同志说：从这次学习中，更清楚地认识到和平民主阵营力量的壮大及其发展前途，思想更开阔了。有的同志说：“学了马林科夫的报告，就好像亲眼看到和平民主力量欣欣向荣，无比地增强了我们保卫祖国大规模经济建设的胜利信心。”
    在学习中，各单位都注意联系思想和工作实际，研究了本单位所存在的主要问题，并适当地解决了一些问题。如：军委某部依据文件精神对本部门的工作和思想情况作了研究，并对该部今后工作发展的方向和规模，作了比较切实的估计，确定了今年思想教育的重点。许多单位在学习马林科夫报告第三部分以后，一致认识到开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评是推动工作的有力武器，从而认真地根据文件精神检验了自己的工作，发现了许多严重的缺点。大家纷纷反映：这次学习对改进我们的领导方法、工作方法、提高干部的思想水平和工作效率，实在是一个很大的启示。还有的单位把这次学习和党委的民主检查密切结合起来，克服了某些现存的官僚主义作风。不少同志这样说：学习“党”的部分好像给我注射了一支补药针，使我进一步体会到官僚主义的危害性，如果没有这一次学习，我的官僚主义的工作作风会更发展。军委的一个部已订出了克服官僚主义的具体办法。
    经过这次学习，在干部政策问题上，纠正了某些同志重才不重德或忽视德、才而强调资的错误认识，同时警惕了仅凭鉴定表、履历表了解干部的不良作风。
    特别重要的是通过这次学习，进一步认识了理论学习的重要性，提高了干部学习理论的兴趣和自觉性，初步养成了学习习惯。普遍反映：“这次学习对工作有很大帮助”，“过去懂得的太少”，“极端的需要学习”，并表示“一定要坚持下去”。这就为进一步开展理论学习打下了良好的基础。此外，关于加强思想工作的重要性及加强党的团结统一的重要性等问题，一般同志也都较前有了进一步的认识。
    这一阶段学习的经验证明：部队高级干部的学习制度是可以坚持下去的。但要做到这一点，首先各级主要领导干部必须以身作则，亲自带头学习，并认真领导所属单位干部的学习，把领导学习当作自己工作的主要内容之一；严格掌握学习制度，按级抓紧、及时督促检查，好的表扬，坏的批评。特别是确立“学习日”制度，保证学习的时间极为重要，为了避免因工作忙乱影响学习，还必须同时加强机关工作的计划性与纪律性，不断改进工作方法，提高工作效率。事实证明：只要加强了工作的计划性与纪律性，学习时间就可以确实得到保证。这是高级干部学习能否组织起来并坚持下去的重要因素。
    其次，必须引导干部正确地联系实际，尽可能使学习的人亲身体验到学习效果，以增强学习的自觉性、主动性。联系实际的方法必须是：全面领会文件的精神实质，联系与解决本部门或个人工作、思想上的一些主要问题，而不是泛泛地没有重点的联系。只有这样，学习才不致走弯路。
    再者，必须加强学习指导。特别是在目前学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”时，由于文件内容较深，加之有些干部政治经济学的基础知识不够，不容易学懂。因此，各中心组今后在理论上的指导更为重要，要有计划地使政治理论水平较高的同志学在前面一些，在理论上给大家以引导和启发。学习中要强调反复阅读斯大林同志的原文，然后辅之以若干必要的参考资料；否则，过多地纠缠在参考文件上面，势必影响学习的效果。
