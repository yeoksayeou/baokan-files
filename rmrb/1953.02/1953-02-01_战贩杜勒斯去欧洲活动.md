Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 31st: Secretary of State of the Eisenhower government, Dulles, and the director of the "Mutual Security Agency", Stassen, left here by plane on the 30th for Europe. According to the US Information Service, they will stay in Europe for ten days, visiting Rome, Paris, London, Bonn, The Hague, Brussels, and Luxembourg in turn.

Before his departure, Dulles issued a formal statement, saying that his visit to the six countries of the so-called "European Defense Group" plan and the United Kingdom, which is "closely related to this plan", was to listen to the governments of these countries for reports on the "latest developments in European defense". He also reiterated the views he put forward in his broadcast speech on the 27th: the United States only wants other countries to act according to its will, but is not prepared to undertake any obligations.

In that broadcast speech, Dulles complained greatly about the fact that the United States' "good idea" of "unifying" Western European countries in a "European Defense Group" for the United States to drive, had been delayed because Britain, France, West Germany, etc. each had their own plans. He said he would go to Europe to "personally investigate" whether the so-called "trend of unification is rising or falling". Obviously, this "trend" is definitely "falling", so Dulles couldn't help but exert crude pressure on Western European countries. He said: For the sake of the United States' "unification" cause, the United States has invested "huge capital" in Western Europe after the war, therefore, "if it seems that there is no hope of achieving effective unification, especially if France, Germany, and Britain each go their own way, the United States must naturally slightly reconsider its own foreign policy toward Western Europe."

A United Press news item pointed out that Dulles rushed to Europe as soon as he took office because the United States felt that "military, economic, and other unification plans are in jeopardy"; his purpose was to "stir up enthusiasm for the stalled unification movement". Another United Press dispatch from London also said that the reason why this "unification movement" was "disintegrating" was because: France was afraid of being overwhelmed by a rearmed West Germany; West Germany demanded that the United States guarantee serious financial and strength support; Britain was unwilling to hand over its army.

Dulles wants to solve the so-called "unification" problem in Western Europe with crude pressure, but the United Press news admitted that Dulles' words have "stirred up more resentment than approval" in Western Europe. The "New York Times" reporter admitted on the 29th that Dulles' speech "has already produced unpleasant impressions in France". Several French bourgeois newspapers criticized Dulles, and "Le Monde" called Dulles' attitude in an editorial a "brutal attitude", believing that it is questionable whether this attitude can achieve the "united Europe" he hopes for. It is particularly significant that British Foreign Secretary Eden, the day after Dulles blamed Britain for dismantling the "unification movement," announced in the British House of Commons on the 28th that Britain was "not prepared to join any political alliance". In this way, the British ruling group politely answered the threat of its arrogant American "big buddy".

Under these circumstances, even the United Press issued an ominous prediction for Dulles' trip to Europe: "They (Dulles and Stassen) will not have easy answers to the question of how to unify Europe now."

    战贩杜勒斯去欧洲活动
    【新华社三十一日讯】华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔政府国务卿杜勒斯三十日和“共同安全署”署长史塔生一起乘飞机离此赴欧洲。据美国新闻处宣布，他们将在欧洲逗留十天，依次到罗马、巴黎、伦敦、波恩、海牙、布鲁塞尔和卢森堡。
    杜勒斯在临行前发表正式声明，说他这次要走访所谓“欧洲防务集团”计划的六个国家以及“与这个计划有密切关系的”英国，是为了听取这些国家政府“关于欧洲防务的最新发展”的报告。他还重申他在二十七日广播演说中提出的意见：美国只要别国按它的意志办事，却不准备承担任何义务。
    在那次广播演说里，杜勒斯对于美国要把西欧国家“统一”在一个“欧洲防御集团”里边以供美国驱使的“好主意”，因为英、法、西德等等各有自己的打算而迟迟未能实现的事实大发牢骚。他说他将去欧洲“亲自调查一下”所谓“统一的趋势是在上升，还是在下降”。显然这种“趋势”确定地是在“下降”，所以杜勒斯忍不住粗暴地对西欧国家施行压力。他说：为了美国这个“统一”事业，美国战后在西欧已下了“庞大的资本”，因此，“假如看来没有达到有效的统一的希望，特别是假如法国、德国和英国竟然各走各的路，美国自然必须稍微重新考虑一下它自己对西欧的外交政策了”。
    合众社的一则消息指出，杜勒斯刚上任，就急急忙忙赶到欧洲去，是因为美国感到“军事的、经济的和其他的统一的计划岌岌可危”；他去的目的是“鼓起对于停滞不前的统一运动的热情”。合众社在另一则发自伦敦的消息中还说，这个“统一运动”之所以“分崩离析”，是因为：法国害怕会被重新武装起来的西德所压倒；西德要求美国保证认真的金钱和实力的支持；英国不愿交出它的军队。
    杜勒斯想用粗暴的压力来解决西欧的所谓“统一”问题，但是，合众社的消息承认，杜勒斯的话已在西欧“促起更多的愤懑，而不是赞同。”“纽约时报”记者二十九日承认：杜勒斯的演说“在法国已经产生了不快的印象”。若干法国资产阶级报纸纷纷抨击杜勒斯，“世界报”在社论中把杜勒斯演说的这种态度称作“残暴的态度”，它认为这种态度是否能达成他所希望的“团结欧洲”的效果，很成问题。特别有意义的是，英国外相艾登在杜勒斯责备英国拆“统一运动”的台的第二天，二十八日，在英国下院宣布英国“不准备加入任何政治联盟”。英国统治集团这样就有礼貌地回答了它的骄横的美国“大伙计”的威吓。
    在这种情况下，连合众社也替杜勒斯这次赴欧的使命发出了不吉利的预告：“他们（杜勒斯和史塔生）将不会有容易的答案，来回答如何使欧洲现在统一起来”。
