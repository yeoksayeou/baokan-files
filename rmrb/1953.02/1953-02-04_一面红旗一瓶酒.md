    A Red Flag and a Bottle of Wine
    An Daping
    Last autumn, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning delegation, before going back to the Korean front, conveyed to the soldiers the love of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army; conveyed the great news of the motherland's industrial construction and the people's happy lives. In addition, they specially brought us a red brocade flag (note) and a bottle of fragrant white wine, gifts from the people of the motherland.
    The red flag was embroidered with golden characters: "Fight for Justice and Peace!" The soldiers said that these were the words of the motherland's people; and the white wine, this showed the love of the people of the motherland for us.
    After discussion by the regimental leaders and the delegates, it was decided to transfer the red flag and white wine to the Third Company. Because they were closest to the enemy, and their task was also the most arduous, so that the comrades could see the red flag, drink the wine, think about the people of the motherland, think about Chairman Mao, and more resolutely and bravely eliminate the enemy.
    When the red flag and white wine arrived at the company command post, the tunnel immediately became lively. The messengers, buglers, cultural instructors, telephone operators, and representatives from each squad who came to listen to the report, scrambled and fought, all wanting to see the gifts from the motherland first. One said, the people of the motherland really care about us, sending a bottle of white wine over thousands of miles! Another said, we must not forget the words of the people of the motherland: "Fight for Justice and Peace!" The company commander and political instructor were also beaming from ear to ear. How should the gifts from the people of the motherland be arranged? After a discussion, everyone agreed that the red flag should be hung in turn on the positions of each squad. Whichever squad it was hung on, that squad should have a good discussion on how to realize the people of the motherland's desire for peace. As for the wine, half a bottle should be poured out for each comrade in the entire company to taste a little, to recall the motherland, which would increase everyone's combat power and eliminate more enemies. The remaining half bottle would be left for the comrades who perform meritorious service in the future to drink.
    The next day at breakfast, among the delicious dishes carefully prepared by the cooks, there was a fragrant smell of wine. Because it was not easy to distribute half a bottle of white wine to each highly dispersed position, it was poured into the dishes so that everyone could taste the flavor of "the Motherland". The comrades in each tunnel carefully chewed the wine flavor in the dishes, thinking knowingly: this wine flavor comes from the distant motherland! How good the motherland is! ... Many comrades said with a smile: it is enough to smell the wine! Speaking of this, the comrades naturally stood up, raised their fists, and solemnly swore facing north: "Motherland! We are your good sons and daughters! We will resolutely defend you! Maybe we will suffer a little, but we will never let the claws of the robbers hurt you, never let the pig hooves of the bandits trample on an inch of the motherland's land!"
    That night, Wu Xilai, a soldier of the Third Platoon, dug nineteen meters of communication trenches overnight, breaking the record of the entire regiment; the comrades of the Machine Gun Third Squad penetrated one and a half meters into the tunnel of green gangue overnight; the soldiers of the Third Squad transported one hundred and twenty logs through the enemy's several fire blockade lines on the muddy mountain road in the heavy rain for two nights, exceeding the task assigned by the superiors of transporting seventy logs... The comrades all said with great interest: "It's strange, after eating the wine sent by the people of the motherland, we have more energy!"
    In the situation of enemy and us confrontation, the comrades of the Third Company actively responded to the call of "killing an enemy is eliminating a harm for the people", and launched a cold gun killing movement, and soon a group of cold gun killing heroes emerged. The company decided to congratulate these comrades who had made meritorious service, and use the half bottle of wine given by the people of the motherland as the most precious congratulatory gift.
    The congratulatory meeting was held in a tunnel fifty meters away from the enemy. On the front stone wall hung the national flag and a portrait of Chairman Mao, and in the middle was a table made of ammunition boxes, on which was placed the precious congratulatory gift - half a bottle of white wine. Each squad sent a representative, each platoon formed a condolence group, they brought red flowers they made themselves, and fast talk lyrics they wrote themselves. The heroes sat in the main seats, with the company commander and political instructor accompanying them on the left and right. Various congratulatory ceremonies were held in warm applause, but the most important ceremony, the most touching scene, was still the delicate sipping of the wine given by the people of the motherland. The table was almost filled with small porcelain bowls, with a small circle of wine poured at the bottom of each bowl. The political instructor stood up and raised his bowl and said:
    "Comrades! Come! First, I wish our dear leader Chairman Mao good health! Cheers!" (In fact, they only sipped a little, drinking a little more would be all gone.)
    The comrades also stood up and shouted in unison: "Cheers!"
    "Secondly, I wish the people of our great motherland a happy life! Cheers!"
    "Cheers!"
    "Thirdly, I wish the meritorious comrades to kill more enemies! Cheers!"
    "Cheers!"
    "Cheers!" ...
    You toasted me, I wished you well, guessing fingers, it was extremely lively; the comrades rejoiced to their heart's content. Then Luo Qing'an, the representative of the meritorious service personnel, spoke: "Today, we ate the wine sent by the people of the motherland, and we must never forget the entrustment of the people of the motherland at all times. In the future, we must eliminate more enemies!" Tan Renben, the representative of the congratulators, spoke: "We are here to congratulate the meritorious comrades, but we also shared the wine sent by the people of the motherland. We feel both happy and ashamed. In the future, we must kill more enemies and strive to meet at the next congratulatory meeting!" Finally, the political instructor said: "Yes, after eating the wine sent by the people of the motherland, only by killing more enemies can we be worthy of the people of the motherland."
    Since then, the cold gun killing movement has been vigorously carried out. Perhaps the enemy thought that we could not see them at night, so they walked back and forth on the position. Under the hazy moonlight, soldier Pan Hansong saw a string of black shadows shaking, closer, forty meters, closer, thirty meters, the submachine gun roared, and most of the black shadows fell down in response. When dawn broke, seven enemy corpses were lying on the ground. On this day, the entire company killed more than thirty enemies.
    The soldiers often fired a shot here, a shot there, you a shot, I a shot, killing the transporting enemies, the sentry enemies, the engineering enemies, the terrain observing enemies, soldiers and officers. They beat the enemies so hard that they could only crawl during the day, and dared not make a sound or show a fire at night. In eighty days, the entire company killed and wounded more than four hundred and forty enemies with cold guns, and a group of five outstanding snipers, such as Luo Qing'an and Pan Hansong, emerged.
    The red flag arrived at the Fourth Squad, and the comrades of the Fourth Squad were determined: "Advance the position forward!" Originally, the position was only fifty meters away from the enemy, but under the control of the enemy's artillery fire, they bravely rushed forward to repair the fortifications, and advanced forty meters in two nights, forcing the stubborn enemy to shrink back and consolidate our main position, creating favorable conditions for the cold gunners to kill the enemy. Soldier Deng Liangfu said happily with a smile: "Isn't this forty meters further away from our motherland's Yalu River!"
    The red flag arrived at the Sixth Squad, and the comrades proposed: "Strictly implement administrative management, preserve ourselves, and actively carry out cold gun battles to eliminate the enemy!" On the position less than eighty square meters in area, two hundred meters away from the enemy, an average of seventy large shells from the enemy fell every day, but they studied the enemy's patterns, bravely and cleverly hit seventeen enemies, and none of them were wounded.
    Recently, the Third Company held two more small counterattacks, and the immortal people's hero Liao Qianming, who sacrificed himself to blow up the bunker, emerged, thus achieving the brilliant achievement of annihilating more than 300 enemies.
    Every shot, every bullet, every needle, every thread, every letter of condolence, every condolence bag from the motherland made us feel particularly cordial and happy. We remember the heart of the people of the motherland every moment, and we never forget the instructions of the people of the motherland every moment: "Fight for Justice and Peace!"
    (Note) The red brocade flag was donated by the people of Hankou.

    一面红旗一瓶酒
    安大鹏
    去年秋天，志愿军归国代表团重返朝鲜前线，给战士们传达了祖国人民热爱志愿军的心情；传达了祖国进行工业建设和人民过着幸福生活等大喜事。另外，还特地给我们带来了祖国人民赠给的一面红色的锦旗（注）和一瓶喷香的白酒。
    红旗上绣着金黄色的大字：“为正义和平而战！”战士们说，这是祖国人民嘱咐的话；而白酒呢，这表现着祖国人民对我们的热爱。
    经过团首长和代表们的商议，决定把红旗和白酒转给第三连。因为他们距敌人最近，任务也最艰巨，让同志们看到红旗吃了酒，想一想祖国人民，想一想毛主席，更坚决更勇敢地消灭敌人吧。
    当红旗和白酒到达连指挥所里的时候，坑道里马上热闹起来了，通讯员、司号员、文化教员、电话员，还有各班来听报告的代表，你争我夺，谁都想先看看来自祖国的礼物。这个说，祖国人民真关心我们，上万里的路还送来瓶白酒！那个说，可不能忘记了祖国人民的话：“为正义和平而战！”连长和指导员也乐的合不上嘴。怎样安排祖国人民送来的礼物呢？经过了一次讨论，大家同意红旗要轮流在各班的阵地上悬挂，挂到那个班，那个班里就要好好讨论，怎样实现祖国人民的和平愿望。酒呢，倒出半瓶来让全连每个同志都尝一点，回想一下祖国，这会增加大家的战斗力量，更多地消灭敌人。余下的半瓶，留给将来立功的同志们喝。
    第二天吃早饭的时候，在炊事员精炒细作的可口的菜中，出现了一股香喷喷的酒味。原来因为半瓶白酒不好分配到高度分散的每个阵地上，所以才倒在菜中，使大家都可尝到“祖国”的味道。每个坑道里的同志们，细细地咀嚼着菜中的酒味，会心地想着：这酒味来自遥远的祖国啊！祖国是多么的好啊！……许多同志都笑着说：闻一闻酒味就满足了！说到这里，同志们很自然地站了起来，高举着拳头，面向着北方庄严地宣誓：“祖国！我们是你的好儿女！我们坚决保卫你！也许我们受点苦，但是，决不让强盗的魔爪伤害你，决不让匪徒的猪蹄践踏祖国的一寸土地！”
    当天晚上，三排战士吴西来一夜就抢挖了交通沟十九公尺，打破了全团的纪录；机枪三班的同志打青岗石的坑道，一夜就穿进了一公尺五；三班的战士们在下着大雨的泥泞的山路上，通过敌人的几道炮火的封锁线，两夜运输了一百二十根木料，超额完成了上级交给的运输七十根的任务……同志们都很有意思地说：“怪得很，吃了祖国人民送来的酒，劲头更大了！”
    在敌我对峙的情况下，三连的同志们积极响应“打死一个敌人为人民除一害”的号召，展开了冷枪杀敌运动，很快地就出现了一批冷枪杀敌功臣。连里决定为这批立功同志贺功，把保存着的那半瓶祖国人民赠给的酒，作为最贵重的贺礼。
    贺功会是在距敌人五十公尺的一条坑道里举行的。正面石壁上悬挂着国旗和毛主席像，地当中摆着一张炮弹箱改成的桌子，桌子上摆着那贵重的贺礼——半瓶白酒。每班选派了一个代表，每排组成一个慰问组，他们带来了自己做的红花，自己编的快板词。功臣们坐上席，连长和指导员左右相陪。在热烈的掌声中举行了庆贺的各种仪式，可是最重要的仪式，最感人的场面，还是细吮那祖国人民赠给的酒。桌上差不多摆满了小磁碗，每个碗底都倒有一个小圆圈的酒，指导员站起来高举着碗说道：
    “同志们！来！首先祝我们亲爱的领袖毛主席身体健康！干杯！”（其实是轻轻地吮了一点，喝多一点就光了。）
    同志们也都跟着站起来齐声喊着：“干杯！”
    “再祝我们伟大的祖国人民生活幸福！干杯！”
    “干杯！”
    “再祝功臣同志们多杀敌人！干杯！”
    “干杯！”
    “干杯！”……
    你敬我，我祝你，猜拳行令，热闹异常；同志们尽情的欢乐。接着功臣代表罗庆安发言：“今天吃了祖国人民送来的酒，更要时刻不忘祖国人民的嘱咐，今后一定要更多地消灭敌人！”贺功的代表谭仁本发言：“我们是来给功臣同志贺功的，可是也分享了祖国人民送来的酒，我们感到又幸福又惭愧。今后一定多杀敌人，争取下次贺功会上见面！”最后指导员说：“是的，吃了祖国人民送来的酒，惟有多杀敌人才对得起祖国人民。”
    从此，冷枪杀敌运动更加蓬勃地开展起来了。也许敌人以为晚上我们看不到他们，于是他们就在阵地上走来走去。战士潘汉松在朦胧的月光下，看到有一串黑影在摇晃，近点，四十公尺，再近点，三十公尺，冲锋枪怒吼了，黑影应声倒下了一大半。天亮了一看，地上躺着七具敌人的尸体。就在这天，全连一共打死三十多名敌人。
    战士们就这样经常东一枪，西一枪，你一枪，我一枪，击毙了运输的敌人，站哨的敌人，修工事的敌人，观察地形的敌人，有士兵也有军官。打得敌人白天只好爬行，晚上不敢出声，不敢露火光。在八十天中间，全连就以冷枪杀伤了敌人四百四十几名，涌现了罗庆安、潘汉松等五个出色的狙击手。
    红旗到了四班了，四班的同志下决心：“把阵地向前推进！”本来阵地只距敌人五十公尺，但是他们在敌人炮火的控制下，英勇的向前抢修工事，两个晚上就推进了四十公尺，迫使顽固的敌人向后缩退，巩固了我们的主阵地，给冷枪手又创造了杀敌的有利条件。战士邓良富愉快地笑着说：“这离我们祖国的鸭绿江不是又远了四十公尺吗！”
    红旗到了六班了，同志们提出：“严格行政管理，保存自己，积极开展冷枪战消灭敌人！”在距敌二百公尺方圆不到八十平方公尺的阵地上，每天平均要落下敌人的七十发大炮弹，可是他们研究了敌人的规律，英勇地巧妙地打中了十七个敌人，而自己无
    一伤亡。
    最近三连又举行了两次小反击，出现了舍身爆破的不朽的人民英雄廖乾明，因而取得歼敌三百余名的辉煌战绩。
    来自祖国的一枪一弹，一针一线，一封慰问信，一个慰问袋，都使我们感到特别亲切和愉快，我们每时每刻都在记着祖国人民的心意，每时每刻也忘不了祖国人民的嘱咐：“为正义和平而战！”
    （注）红锦旗是汉口市人民赠的。
