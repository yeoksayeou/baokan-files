Spring Festival has arrived. It has just snowed in Beijing. In the evening, the snow melted, and people flocked to department stores to buy sweets and navy uniforms for their children, and floral fabrics for their loved ones. Every street sees countless happy people pass by every day. A few days ago, when I was still in the countryside, I saw the same scene. Through various market towns and countless primary markets, new bibs were put on rural children, and many rural women wore floral cloth clothes for the Spring Festival. The 27 members of the Wangjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, took out 3.8 million yuan worth of grain at a small material exchange fair to purchase various daily-use industrial products. The people of Beijing are happy; our capital, the happy heart of our motherland, is also bringing happiness to every corner and every person of the motherland through its own vascular organization.

People's Volunteer Army soldier Comrade Dong Shengqi! I have been to your home in Wangjiazhuang Village, northwest of Licheng, Shanxi. Your family's 3.6 mu of valley land was cultivated by the agricultural production cooperative last year, yielding 629 jin of Bailiusha millet per mu! You know, the highest yield of valley land there in the past was only 280 jin per mu, and even the bumper year of 1951 was only 311 jin! You wrote a letter asking your father to work as much as possible without increasing the burden on the masses. Dear comrade, don't worry! Your father, old man Dong Shanqing, is a good member of the agricultural production cooperative. He is strong and in good spirits, with a smile on his face all day long.

Volunteer Army comrades! In the countryside, there are many old people like Dong Shanqing, and the yield of grain like Dong Shengqi's family is not an isolated case. Last year, people responded to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and increased the yield per unit area of land. The 13.5 mu of Jin Huanghou corn experimental field in the Wangjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative produced 1,602 jin and 9 liang per mu, more than three and a half times the average yield of 350 jin per mu in the previous year! But this is not the highest yield. Shanxi also has corn yields of 1,757 jin per mu in Tunliu County, and millet yields of 1,457 jin per mu and wheat yields of 733 jin per mu in Wuxiang County. When paying public grain, which village did not complete it in one day, and which village did not pay more than the task! Moreover, last winter, many families felt that their grain bins were not enough, and urged the supply and marketing cooperative to buy more; many women, while carrying 24-jin pumpkins and 12-jin radishes, would smile and complain: "Bumper harvest, bumper harvest! I'm really not afraid of exhausting people! Who can move this!"

People are not satisfied with such yields. People said: "The Soviet Union produces 2,800 jin of corn per mu!" and "Our Volunteer Army has done so many great things! Can't we do it?" People are planting their own land, looking at the collective farms of the Soviet Union, thinking of the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army, and organizing themselves strongly. In the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi, 88 percent of the labor force in 16 counties and one city has been organized into tens of thousands of mutual aid groups and more than 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives. Last autumn, 920 peasant households in Guancun, Nanchui, Wangcun, and Zhuoma villages near Changzhi also joined the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" established by themselves with their 16,607 mu of land.

People have set out production plans. In order to complete and exceed the plan, they overturned the old saying that "a year's plan starts in spring" and turned the winter of 1952 into the first season of production in 1953. Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en in Pingshun, and many veteran village cadres in the Changzhi area, led the militiamen who had followed the army south for a year, led 18-year-old girls and experienced old men, stepped on the snow, faced the wind, walked every inch of the mountain slopes in their villages, surveyed every stone and every blade of grass, and excavated all the potential for production. They padded every mu of sandy soil with 300 dan of red soil, padded every mu of red soil with 300 dan of sandy soil, raised the high ground on the slopes and lowered the low ground, and padded the inside of the beach land with the outside; they connected the small plots of land of the agricultural production cooperative members into large pieces, they dug wells and opened canals, and found water from the stones. The land in Wangjiazhuang, Licheng, had never been irrigated, and the water that people drank was also a pool of stinky water, which was deficient in iodine, and many people in the village had thick necks; last spring, under the leadership of Dong Taoqi, Dong Pantang, and Yue Licun, the directors of the agricultural production cooperative, the village gathered the water from the back mountain bit by bit, built a 198-zhang-long canal, and also dug five living water wells, six reservoirs, and thirty-eight lying cattle pits. Last year, 421 mu of land in the village enjoyed irrigation for the first time. The clear canal water flowed under the street stones, with a wellhead every so often, so that people could scoop up water to drink and use from the wellhead with a bowl. The village's sanitation work is also underway, and goiter will be a thing of the past!

The life of the rural motherland is undergoing drastic changes. Communist Party members are studying the eight requirements of the standards for Party members, and agricultural production cooperative members are making annual appraisals; Dong Xiantang and Fan Enzhi of Wangjiazhuang are fiercely arguing about issues at the Youth League branch meeting, but they are a good couple and two good League members. The quick literacy method has eliminated illiteracy for 52 people in Wangjiazhuang. Because of their good results, they received an award from the North China Administrative Council; now, the old class is consolidating, and the new class is rushing to learn new words. All 205 households in the village have subscribed to 50 copies of various books and newspapers, and there are many small pamphlets purchased separately. Young people are openly dating. There were eight pairs who got married and engaged freely in Wangjiazhuang last winter. The militia is doing horizontal bars, vaulting horses, playing basketball, and wiping guns to practice martial arts. Harmonicas and group dances have begun to go to the countryside, and farmers also have new-style delivery boxes and clinics. Communist Party members, Youth League members, as well as members of the China-Soviet Friendship Association and agricultural production cooperative members, these glorious titles, people regard them as the goal of life, striving to at least be worthy of one or two of them.

Volunteer Army comrades, your names have also become the driving force for all progress in the countryside. When Wangjiazhuang was building the canal last year, some people said: "No one has ever brought a drop of water to the village for thousands of generations, but your agricultural cooperative can?" Later, when the canal had to pass through a stone wall, some people said again: "Can water go over the wall? Hehe, wishful thinking!" People replied: "Now we have Chairman Mao and the Soviet Union, and there are many things that have never happened for thousands of generations!" "Our Volunteer Army can defeat American imperialism, and we can make water go over the wall!" In the classrooms of the people's schools and at the meetings of patriotic inspection days, how much power your deeds generate! When the news of your victory on the Shangganling front was written on the rural blackboard newspaper, when the deeds of the hero Huang Jiguang were broadcast through the rural loudspeaker, the old people became stronger, the girls looked more beautiful, and the cadres worked harder! As for the youth, countless requests: to go to Korea. Hearing that the United States was shamelessly plotting to overturn the armistice negotiations and vainly attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, they firmly stated: "If it dares to take risks, we will go!"

Volunteer Army comrades in Korea! I have just returned from the countryside of Shanxi, and all I can write to you is just a little bit. Compared with the vivid reality, I have indeed written too little. But as a literary and art worker, when the motherland is celebrating the Spring Festival, I feel it is my responsibility to report a little bit of the situation to you. I will go to the countryside again, and I will report the situation to you again. I hope that I can tell you more and better in the future.

    春节寄志愿军
    康濯
    春节来到了。北京刚下过雪，傍晚，雪化了，人们一群群涌进百货公司，给小孩买糖果买海军装，给爱人量花布。每一条大街，每一天不知道要走过多少欢乐的人们。几天以前，当我还在农村的时候，我看到的也是同样的情景。通过各个集镇和无数的初级市场，有多少新的围嘴戴到了农村小孩的身上，有多少农村妇女，在春节穿上了花布缝制的衣裳。山西黎城县王家庄农业生产合作社的二十七户社员，就在一个小型的物资交流会上，拿出了价值三百八十万元的粮食，购买了各种日用的工业品。北京的人们是幸福的；我们的首都，我们祖国的幸福的心脏，通过自己的血管组织，也把幸福带给了祖国的每一个角落，每一个人。
    人民志愿军战士董声岐同志！我到过山西黎城王家庄村西北角上你的家，你家里三亩六分谷地，去年由农业生产合作社代耕，每亩打下了六二九斤白柳沙谷子！你知道，你们那里过去谷地的最高产量，每亩才到二八○斤，一九五一年丰产，也不过三一一斤呢！你写信叫你父亲尽可能多劳动，不要加重群众的负担。亲爱的同志，你不用惦记！你的父亲董善庆老人家，是农业生产合作社的好社员，他老人家又结实精神又好，脸上整天笑的像花。
    志愿军同志们！在农村，像董善庆这样的老人家多得很，像董声岐同志家谷地的产量，更不是个别的。去年一年，人们响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，提高土地的单位面积产量，王家庄农业生产合作社十三亩半金皇后玉米丰产地，每亩产到一、六○二斤九两，超过前年每亩平均产三五○斤的三倍半！但这还并不是最高的产量，山西还有屯留县每亩一、七五七斤的玉米，有武乡县每亩一、四五七斤的谷和每亩七三三斤的小麦。缴公粮的时候，哪一村不是一天完成，哪一村缴上去的数目不超过任务！而且，去年冬天，有多少人家感到粮食囤子不够用，催供销合作社快买；有多少妇女在搬着二十四斤一个的南瓜和十二斤一个的白萝卜的时候，要一边笑着一边埋怨：“丰产丰产！真不怕累坏了人！这谁可搬动了啊！”
    人们对这样的产量，并没有满足。人们说：“苏联一亩玉米产二千八百斤哩！”又说：“咱志愿军干了多少大事！咱们这就能行？”人们手种着自己的地，眼望着苏联的集体农庄，心想着志愿军的英雄事迹，坚强地组织起来。山西长治专区十六个县一个市，就有百分之八十八的劳力组织到了几万个互助组里和一千多个农业生产合作社里。去年秋天，长治附近关村、南垂、王村、捉马四个村的九二○户农民，还带着他们一六、六○七亩地，参加进他们自己成立的“中苏友好集体农庄”里。
    人们订出了生产计划。为了完成和超过计划，推翻了“一年之计在于春”这句老话，把一九五二年冬天变成了一九五三年生产的第一季。平顺的李顺达和郭玉恩，以及长治地区许多久经考验的村干部，他们领着曾随大军南下过一年的民兵，领着十八岁的姑娘和经验丰富的老汉，踏着雪，迎着风，走遍他们村的每一寸山坡，勘察着每一块石头每一根草，挖掘一切生产上的潜在力。他们把每亩沙土地垫上三百担红土，把红土地垫上三百担沙土，把坡地起高垫低，把滩地里切外垫；他们给农业生产合作社社员的小块地联成大片，他们打井开渠，从石头里找出水来。黎城王家庄的土地从没浇过水，人喝的也是一池臭水，水缺碘，村里不知有多少人脖子长的老粗；去年春天，村子就在农业生产合作社社长董桃气、董泮堂和岳礼存的领导下，把后山一点一滴的水集合起来，修成了一道一百九十八丈长的水渠，还打了五个活水井、六个蓄水池和三十八个卧牛坑。村里去年有四二一亩地第一次享受到了水浇。清凌凌的渠水在街石下边流着，每隔不远开一个井口，吃水用水，使碗就能从井口舀上来。村里卫生工作跟着展开，粗脖子病也将一去不回头了！
    祖国农村的生活正在发生着急剧的变化。共产党员在学习党员标准的八项条件，农业生产合作社员在作全年的鉴定；王家庄的董献堂和范恩芝，在青年团支部大会上激烈地争论问题，但他俩是一对好夫妇，两个好团员。速成识字法在王家庄扫除了五十二个文盲，因为成绩好，得到了华北行政委员会的奖励；现在，老班在巩固，新班在突击生字，全村二○五户，订了各种书报五十份，零买的小册子还有好多。青年们公开谈恋爱，王家庄一冬天自由结婚和订婚的就有八对。民兵在翻单杠、跳木马、打篮球，在擦枪练武。口琴和集体舞开始下乡了，农民也有了新式接产箱和医疗所。共产党员，青年团员，还有中苏友好协会会员和农业生产合作社社员，这些光荣的称号，人们都看成生命的目标，争取着至少要够得上其中一两个称号。
    志愿军同志们，你们的名字，在农村也成了一切进步的动力。王家庄去年修渠，有人说：“千年万辈没人给村里闹下过一滴水，偏你们农业社就能？”后来渠道要过一道石墙，又有人说：“水就能上墙？嘿嘿，妄想！”人们回答道：“如今有毛主席，有苏联，千年万辈没有过的事多着哩！”“咱们志愿军能打败美帝国主义，咱们就能叫水上墙！”在民校课堂上，在爱国检查日的会场上，你们的事迹，产生着多大的力量啊！当你们在上甘岭前线打了胜仗的消息写在农村黑板报上的时候，当英雄黄继光烈士的事迹通过农村广播筒传出来的时候，老人们变得更加健壮了，姑娘们显得更加漂亮了，干部们工作得更加起劲了！至于青年，无数无数的要求：到朝鲜去。听到美国无耻地阴谋推翻停战谈判，妄想扩大侵朝战争，他们就坚决地表示：“它要胆敢冒险，咱们就去！”
    在朝鲜的志愿军同志！我刚从山西农村回来，我能写给你们的，却只有这么一点点，比起活鲜鲜的现实，我的确写得太少了。但作为一个文艺工作者，在祖国欢度春节的时候，我感到向你们报告一点情况，是我的责任。我还要到农村去，我将再向你们报告情况，希望我以后能向你们说得多一些，说得好一些。    　一九五三年二月十七日于北京
