    The Chinese People's Volunteers, displaying a great internationalist spirit, with commanders and soldiers in the tense and frequent combat environment, saved grain to relieve the Korean people; helped the Korean people with production, medical treatment, water conservancy construction, and tree planting and forest protection, deeply winning the warm love and sincere gratitude of the Korean people.

    Last year, when the ice and snow in Korea had not completely melted and the spring plowing season was approaching, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to ensure that the Korean people, who had been devastated and destroyed by the American aggressors and lacked manpower and material resources, would not miss the farming season, instructed the entire army to actively help the Korean people with spring plowing; calling on all commanders and soldiers to economize on food and clothing to help the families of Korean People's Army soldiers, the families of martyrs, and disaster-stricken refugees to survive the spring famine.

    The Chinese Communist Party committees and political organs of various units, as well as the party branch committees of various companies, earnestly studied and discussed the instructions of the Political Department of the Volunteers, investigated the situation in their stationed areas, and formulated plans to help the Korean people with spring plowing and to relieve disaster victims. They put forward slogans such as: "Working people of the world are one family; the suffering of the Korean people is our suffering; helping the Korean people is the same as helping the people of our motherland." "Don't let a single Korean person in the stationed area go hungry." "Strive to reduce the amount of barren land and have no barren land in the stationed area," and other slogans. Many units also proposed: "Without affecting health, each person should save one or two liang of grain per day." According to incomplete statistics, the entire army had distributed 2,450,715 jin of relief grain by the end of last October. More than 257,000 families of Korean People's Army soldiers, families of martyrs, and disaster-stricken refugees received relief.

    While providing disaster relief, the Volunteers launched a large-scale campaign to help the Korean people with spring plowing throughout the army. Units guarding the front lines, while constantly repelling enemy attacks, specially formed spring plowing shock teams with soldiers who had rich experience in farming, bravely helping the Korean people with rushing to plow and plant, braving enemy aircraft and artillery fire and bombing. Some units organized air defense sentries to monitor enemy aircraft activity while carrying out farming. Office cadres worked during the day and took advantage of the early morning and evening hours to help the Korean people reclaim wasteland and cultivate the land. In areas where livestock were scarce, they used human power to pull plows. They also helped the Korean people carry manure to the fields one load at a time. A communications company of a certain unit helped the Korean people cultivate 48 mu of land, sow 50 mu, and deliver 42,800 jin of fertilizer in half a month. By mid-May last year, the entire army had helped the Korean people cultivate more than 131,000 mu of land, sow more than 12,800 mu, reclaim more than 1,100 mu of wasteland, fertilize more than 3,000 mu, and deliver more than 451,000 loads of manure. With the concerted efforts of the entire army, the vast number of Korean people in the stationed areas completed their planting tasks according to the season.

    While helping the Korean people with spring plowing, the commanders and soldiers of the Volunteers paid close attention to the heavy rainfall and frequent mountain floods in Korea's rainy season. They vigorously dug drainage ditches, built dams, and repaired and constructed water conservancy projects for the Korean people. A certain unit built a large drainage ditch in Jiangdong County that was 2,400 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 6 meters deep, with the riverbed paved with stone slabs. This drainage ditch solved the irrigation problems for the entire Jiangdong area. The soldiers said while building this drainage ditch: "We must complete this project with the determination of Chairman Mao to 'definitely repair the Huai River well.'" A certain unit, with a huge force of 14,000 workdays, built a dam 3,000 meters long. This dam ensured the convenience of irrigation and freedom from water damage for 3,000 mu of fertile land, which could increase grain production by 928 dan. In the spring and summer seasons of last year alone, the Volunteers built 109 kilometers of ditches for the Korean people, which could irrigate more than 21,000 mu of land.

    The American aggressor's aerial bandits not only indiscriminately bombed peaceful cities and villages in Korea, but also dropped a large number of gasoline bombs in the dense Korean mountain forests, attempting to turn the beautiful Korean mountain forests into ashes. In addition to constantly giving the American aggressor's aerial bandits severe blows, the Chinese People's Volunteers also launched tree planting and forest protection work. In the spring of last year alone, the entire army planted 5,190,000 new saplings for the Korean people. On May 16 last year, when a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers had just moved to its new station, the area had suffered from enemy air raids on the 15th, and dozens of mountain forests had caught fire, threatening to turn these verdant forests into ashes. Although the unit had been marching continuously, all the commanders and soldiers disregarded their fatigue and immediately joined the battle to put out the mountain fire and save the forests. Braving thick smoke and raging flames, the soldiers repeatedly rescued the forests for three days, finally extinguishing the fire and saving more than 41,250 huge trees from being burned.

    In the gaps between battles, the commanders and soldiers of the Volunteers also helped the Korean people dig air-raid shelters, repair houses destroyed by the enemy, explain current events and hygiene knowledge to the Korean people, administer vaccinations, treat illnesses, give haircuts... A hospital of a certain unit vaccinated and inoculated 26,537 Korean people in April of last year alone, greatly reducing the occurrence of infectious diseases. The Volunteers constantly rescued Korean people in distress with the selfless spirit of the immortal internationalist soldier Luo Shengjiao. On February 24 last year, the station area of a certain unit of the Volunteers was bombed by enemy aircraft, and Korean citizen Wu Bingjun was unfortunately seriously injured, losing too much blood, and his life was in danger. Comrades Zhang Fucheng, a pharmacist, and Liu Langen, a nurse squad leader, from that unit voluntarily donated a total of 500 cc of their own blood, and Wu Bingjun was saved from danger with the help of the Volunteers' blood. On March 25 last year, the house of Korean resident Yan Jihua was bombed by enemy aircraft and caught fire. Yan Jihua's son and daughter were trapped in the house by the collapsed house and raging fire and could not escape. Enemy aircraft continued their frenzied bombing, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, Guo Zhiyuan, deputy platoon leader, Yuan Dianbin, deputy squad leader, and He Mingwei, a soldier, from a communications company of a certain unit of the Volunteers, disregarding the enemy aircraft's bombing and the danger of being burned by the fire, crawled into the collapsed house, dug through the collapsed earth, and rescued the two Korean children.

    There were many storms and heavy rains in the Korean autumn, and the frost came early, requiring crops to be harvested and threshed quickly after they ripened. In response to this situation, the Political Department of the Volunteers issued instructions to the entire army on September 10 last year to help the Korean people complete the autumn harvest in a timely manner. The commanders and soldiers of the Volunteers, while resolutely crushing the enemy's so-called "Autumn Counterattack Operation" and protecting the Korean people's autumn harvest, also actively devoted themselves to helping the Korean people's autumn harvest work, utilizing all possible time. During the autumn harvest, a certain unit helped the Korean people harvest 10,241 mu of crops and transport 2,097 mu of crops.

    While helping the Korean people with labor, the commanders and soldiers of the Volunteers strictly implemented the instructions of the higher authorities to "cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree of the Korean people." They cultivated deeply and carefully, not damaging farm implements, as if they were cultivating and harvesting their own crops; they did not step on a single green seedling in normal times; and they did not carelessly drop a single grain of food during the harvest. They did not take any remuneration, strictly abided by policies, discipline, and the customs and habits of the Korean people, and tried their best to use their own tools to help the Korean people with production and labor.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers' unparalleled love and care for the Korean people has won the sincere love and respect of the Korean people. They call the Chinese People's Volunteers: "A rare good army in the world." They tried every means to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and cherish the Chinese People's Volunteers. They rushed to send their children to join the People's Army and the Volunteers to fight side by side. Korean women also voluntarily organized themselves to wash and mend clothes for the soldiers, sprout bean sprouts, make tofu, and dig wild vegetables for the troops, helping the troops improve their lives. In battle, the Korean people also voluntarily risked their lives, endured great hardships, and overcame many difficulties to help the Volunteers transport ammunition, transfer and care for the wounded. During intense battles, many strong young Korean women, braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, set up tea stations along the roads to comfort the wounded Volunteers, and some formed blood transfusion teams to go to the Volunteers' hospitals to give blood transfusions to the wounded. Their blood saved the lives of many wounded Volunteers. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people are thus closely linked heart to heart, hand in hand, fighting together against the American aggressors, for the security of their motherlands, and for peace in the Far East and the world.

    热爱朝鲜人民的中国人民志愿军
    黎明
    中国人民志愿军发扬了伟大的国际主义精神，各部队的指挥员、战斗员在紧张频繁的战斗环境中，节约粮食救济朝鲜人民；帮助朝鲜人民生产、治病、兴修水利、植树护林，深受到朝鲜人民热忱的爱戴与衷心的感激。
    去年，当朝鲜的冰雪还没有完全融化，春耕季节即将到来以前，志愿军政治部为了使深受美国侵略军摧残、破坏，人力物力缺乏的朝鲜人民不误农时，便指示全军积极地帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕；号召全体指挥员、战斗员节衣缩食，帮助朝鲜人民军军属、烈士家属和受灾难民度过春荒。
    各部队的中国共产党委员会和政治机关、各连队党的支部委员会都认真地研究讨论了志愿军政治部的指示，调查了驻地的情况，制订了帮助朝鲜人民春耕和救济灾民的计划。他们提出：“天下劳动人民是一家；朝鲜人民的痛苦就是我们的痛苦；帮助朝鲜人民就和帮助祖国人民一样。”“不让驻地有一个朝鲜人民挨饿。”“争取驻地减少荒田和没有荒田”等口号。许多单位还提出：“在不妨碍健康的情况下，每人每日节约一两粮食。”据不完全统计，全军到去年十月底就发放了救济粮二百四十五万零七百一十五斤。二十五万七千多朝鲜人民军军属、烈属和受灾难民得到了救济。
    在救灾的同时，志愿军又在全军展开了大规模的帮助朝鲜人民春耕工作。守卫在前沿阵地的部队，一面不断地打退敌人的进攻，一面又特别把对耕种有丰富经验的战士们组成春耕突击队，冒着敌人的飞机、大炮的射击和轰炸，奋力帮助朝鲜人民抢耕抢种。有的部队组织了防空哨，监视敌机活动进行耕种。机关工作干部白天工作，便趁早晚时间帮助朝鲜人民开荒和耕种。在牲畜缺少的地区，他们就用人拉犁。他们还帮助朝鲜人民把粪一担一担地挑到地里去。某部通讯连在半个月中即帮助朝鲜人民耕地四十八亩、播种五十亩、送粪四万二千八百斤，浇地十亩。到去年五月中旬，全军共帮助朝鲜人民耕地十三万一千多亩、播种一万二千八百多亩，开荒一千一百多亩，施肥三千多亩，送粪四十五万一千多担。在全军一致努力下，使驻区广大的朝鲜人民都按照季节完成了耕种任务。
    志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们在帮助朝鲜人民春耕的同时，就密切注意了朝鲜雨季山洪多的情形。他们大力为朝鲜人民挖防水沟、筑堤坝、修复和兴建水利工程。某部在江东郡修了一条长二千四百公尺、宽六公尺、深六公尺，河底铺上了石板的大水沟。这一条水沟解决了整个江东地区的灌溉问题。战士们在修筑这条水沟时说：“我们要以毛主席
    ‘一定要把淮河修好’的决心来完成这个工程。”某部以一万四千个工的巨大力量，修成了一条三千公尺长的水坝。这条水坝保证了三千亩肥沃的土地灌溉的便利和不受水害，可以增加产粮九百二十八担。仅去年春夏两季，志愿军就为朝鲜人民修筑了水沟一百零九公里长，可灌溉二万一千多亩地。
    美国侵略军的空中强盗，不仅对朝鲜的和平城市和乡村滥施轰炸，并且把大量的汽油弹投掷在茂密的朝鲜山林中，他们妄想把美丽的朝鲜山林也都变成灰烬。中国人民志愿军除了不断地给美国侵略军的空中强盗严重的打击之外，又展开了植树护林的工作。仅去年春季，全军就为朝鲜人民新栽下五百一十九万棵树苗。去年五月十六日，中国人民志愿军某部刚移至新驻地时，该地正于十五日遭受敌机的轰炸，数十处山林引起漫天的大火，眼看着这些碧绿的森林，就要化为灰烬。该部虽然经过连续行军，但全体指挥员、战斗员却不顾一切疲劳，立即投入了扑灭山火，挽救森林的战斗。战士们冒着浓烟烈火反复抢救了三天，终于将火扑灭，使四万一千二百五十余棵巨大的树木免予被烧。
    志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们，在战斗的空隙中还帮助朝鲜人民挖防空洞、修盖被敌人炸毁了的房子，给朝鲜人民讲解时事、卫生常识，注射防疫针、治病、理发……。某部医院在去年四月一个月中，就给二万六千五百三十七位朝鲜人民注射了防疫针和种了牛痘，大大减少了传染病的发生。志愿军战士们，不断以不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教的忘我精神抢救危难中的朝鲜人民。去年二月二十四日，志愿军某部驻地遭受敌机轰炸，朝鲜人民吴炳俊不幸负重伤，流血过多，性命危险。该部司药张福成、护士班长刘兰根二同志主动输出自己鲜血共五百西西，吴炳俊在志愿军战士鲜血的援助下转危为安。去年三月二十五日，朝鲜居民阎吉华的房子被敌机轰炸起火，阎吉华的一个男孩和一个女孩被倒塌的房子和烈火阻止在屋里没有逃出来。敌机仍继续进行着疯狂的轰炸，情况万分危急。这时，志愿军某部通讯连副排长郭志远、副班长袁殿斌、战士何明为三人，不顾敌机的轰炸和烈火烧身的危险，钻进倒塌的房子里，挖开倒塌的泥土，救出了这两个朝鲜儿童。
    朝鲜秋季风雨甚多，寒霜降得很早，庄稼成熟后需要快收、快打。针对这种情况，志愿军政治部于去年九月十日，向全军又发出了帮助朝鲜人民及时完成秋收的指示。志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们，一面坚决地粉碎了敌人的所谓“秋季反击作战”的窜扰，保护朝鲜人民秋收；一面又利用一切可能的时间积极地投入了帮助朝鲜人民秋收的工作。某部在秋收中帮助朝鲜人民收割庄稼一万零二百四十一亩，搬运庄稼二千零九十七亩。
    在帮助朝鲜人民劳动中，志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们，严格地执行了上级“爱护朝鲜人民一山一水一草一木”的指示。他们像对待自己的耕种和收获一样，耕种时，深耕细作，不损坏农具；平时，不踏一棵青苗；收割时，不随便漏掉一粒粮食。他们不取任何报酬，严格遵守政策纪律和朝鲜人民的风俗习惯，并尽量使用自己的工具帮助朝鲜人民生产劳动。
    中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的无比热爱和关怀，受到朝鲜人民衷心的爱戴和尊敬。他们称中国人民志愿军是：“天底下少有的好队伍”。他们想尽一切办法来支援中国人民志愿军，爱护中国人民志愿军。他们争先恐后地送自己的子女参加人民军和志愿军并肩作战。朝鲜妇女还在平时自动组织起来去给战士们洗、补衣服，给部队生豆芽、作豆腐、挖野菜……，帮助部队改善生活。战斗中，朝鲜人民又自动地冒着性命危险，忍受着很大艰苦，战胜许多困难，帮助志愿军运送弹药，转运和服侍伤员。战斗激烈的时候，许多健壮的朝鲜青年妇女，冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，在路上设立茶水站，慰问志愿军伤员，有的并组成输血队，到志愿军的医院里去给伤员输血。她们的鲜血，挽救了许多志愿军伤员的性命。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民就这样地心紧连着心，手携着手，为着反对美国侵略者，为着自己祖国的安全和远东及世界的和平而共同奋斗。
