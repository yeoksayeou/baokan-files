    Construction Units Exhibit Impetuous Thinking and "Masterpiece" Ideology
    Serious Waste in Construction Projects of Beijing Children's Hospital and Other Units

    The expansion projects of Beijing Children's Hospital and Tongren Hospital, as well as the new Red Cross Hospital project, have many serious shortcomings in planning, design, and construction.

    In order to solve the problem of insufficient medical outpatient services and beds in Beijing, it was decided as early as 1951 to expand the Beijing Children's Hospital by 31,000 square meters and Tongren Hospital by 17,000 square meters. However, due to poor planning by the construction units and the strong "masterpiece" ideology of some designers, plans and designs were frequently revised. By the end of 1952, the designs and plans for these two hospitals had been completely overturned twice and partially modified more than twenty times, resulting in extremely slow progress. As of now, the Children's Hospital has only completed 2,590 square meters of foundation work, and Tongren Hospital has only completed 2,416 square meters of foundation work. Such repeated changes in design and plans not only wasted design resources, but more seriously, delayed the time to solve the problem of insufficient outpatient services and beds, and long-term accumulation of the state's investment of hundreds of billions of yuan.

    Because the designers only pursued novelty, disregarding economic conditions and construction difficulties, the final design plan for the expansion project of the Children's Hospital had a wide variety of specifications. Of the 292 columns, there were 143 different types, and the most common column appeared only four times. Of the 480 reverse beams, there were 430 types. Such a complex design is both uneconomical and increases the difficulty of construction. For example, the reinforcement could not keep up with the pouring of concrete, resulting in 1,942 lost workdays for concrete workers in the foundation project. The calculation standards for the structure in the design were very conservative. For example, the office load, according to the experience of Northeast China, has long been confirmed to be calculated at 200 kilograms, but they still calculated it at 250 kilograms. These are all technically avoidable wastes. The construction organization of this project was already poor, and the supply of materials was not timely. Coupled with frequent changes in design, this caused serious waste phenomena such as work stoppages waiting for materials and waiting for drawings.

    For the Tongren Hospital project, the Beijing leadership instructed that the principle was to invest 20 billion yuan to build 17,000 square meters of housing. However, the Beijing Construction Company, which undertook this project, arbitrarily designed the project according to an investment of 44 billion yuan in 1952. Before the design drawings were fully completed, the leading cadres of the company arbitrarily instructed the First Engineering Office under its jurisdiction to violate financial discipline and the instructions and principles of the Beijing leadership, advance more than 5 billion yuan, and carry out the foundation project according to the 44 billion yuan design.

    The construction project of the Red Cross Hospital reflects the serious impetuous thinking of the leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Company. Before the design drawings were completed, the company's chief engineer set a deadline for the supply department to supply 116,659 kilograms of 1.2-inch square steel. After the design was completed, this specification of square steel was not needed at all, resulting in a backlog of 1.2677 billion yuan in funds (excluding freight). The company started construction without obtaining a construction permit issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, and built the house beyond the foundation line, making it impossible to straighten the Yong'an Road that was being built, which damaged the urban construction plan.

    The above-mentioned deviations in the construction projects of the three hospitals have not yet attracted the attention of the Beijing leadership. The Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee should immediately seriously check and correct these deviations.

### 建设单位存在冒进思想和杰作思想  北京市儿童医院等单位建筑工程浪费很大

    建设单位存在冒进思想和杰作思想
    北京市儿童医院等单位建筑工程浪费很大
    北京市儿童医院、同仁医院增建新院房工程和新建红十字会医院工程，在计划、设计、施工中存在着许多严重缺点。
    北京市为了解决医疗门诊和病床不足的问题，早在一九五一年就决定儿童医院增建三万一千平方公尺院房，同仁医院增建一万七千平方公尺院房。但由于建设单位计划不周和部分设计人员存在着浓厚的杰作思想，常常修改计划和设计，到一九五二年年底止，这两个医院的设计、计划整个地被推翻两次，局部修改了二十余次，工程进度极慢。到目前为止，儿童医院仅完成二千五百九十平方公尺基础工程，同仁医院仅完成二千四百一十六平方公尺基础工程。这样反复变更设计和计划，不但浪费了设计力量，尤其严重的是推迟了解决门诊和病床不足问题的时间，长期积压了国家数百亿元的投资。
    由于设计人员只追求新奇，不顾经济条件和施工的困难，儿童医院增建新院房工程最后定案的设计，规格繁多。二百九十二根柱子有一百四十三样，同样的柱子最多的只有四根；四百八十个反梁有四百三十样。设计这样复杂，既不经济，又增加了施工的困难。如扎钢筋赶不上浇混凝土，使混凝土工在基础工程中窝工一千九百四十二个。设计中结构的计算标准却很保守。如办公室荷重，根据东北的经验，早已肯定了按二百公斤计算即可，他们还按二百五十公斤计算。这些都是在技术上可以避免的浪费。这个工程的施工组织本来就不好，器材供应也不及时，再加上经常变更设计，便造成停工待料、待图等严重浪费现象。
    同仁医院工程，北京市领导机关指示的原则是以二百亿元投资建筑一万七千平方公尺房屋。但承建这一工程的北京市建筑公司在一九五二年竟擅自按照四百四十亿元投资设计。在设计图未完全做好以前，该公司领导干部又擅自指示所属第一工程处违反财政纪律、违反北京市领导机关的指示原则，垫款五十余亿元，按四百四十亿元的设计做了基础工程。
    红十字会医院的建设工程反映了北京市建筑公司领导干部有严重的冒进思想。设计图还没做好，该公司总工程师就限期供应部门供应一寸二的方钢十一万六千六百五十九公斤。设计完以后，根本用不着这种规格的方钢，积压资金十二亿六千七百万元（运费尚未计算在内）。该公司没有取得北京市人民政府建设局发给的建筑执照就施工，把房子盖出房基线，使修筑的永安路不能取直，都市建设计划受到破坏。
    上述三个医院建设工程中的偏向，直到现在还没有引起北京市领导机关的注意。北京市财政经济委员会应即认真检查纠正这些偏向。
