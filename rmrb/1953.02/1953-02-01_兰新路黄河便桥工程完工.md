    Lanxin Railway Yellow River Provisional Bridge Project Completed
    The Lan(zhou)-Xin(jiang) Railway Yellow River Provisional Bridge project, which began construction on November 1st of last year, was successfully completed on January 10th after more than two months of intensive work.
    The Yellow River Provisional Bridge is one of the largest key projects on the Lanxin Railway line. The bridge is thirteen meters above the water surface, and the nearby current is turbulent, making construction very difficult. After the Third Engineering Team of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau accepted this engineering task last October, they worked intensely in freezing weather below zero degrees. Because they conscientiously adopted advanced Soviet experience, using caissons instead of bridge piers and erecting steel beams on wooden rafts, the project progressed rapidly. The bridge's foundation work was completed by the end of last year.
    During the construction process, the policy of combining cadres with workers and politics with technology was implemented, and a red banner competition was launched, greatly encouraging the workers' enthusiasm for labor and continuously improving production. For example, the Mechanical Corps, after criticizing conservative thinking, signed apprenticeship contracts and patriotic apprenticeship pacts. Apprentices quickly mastered the technology, and their work continuously improved, so they were twice rated as advanced units and won awards such as red banners and bonuses. Political work cadres also voluntarily took turns patrolling at night to ensure the smooth progress of the project. After more than two months of active efforts by all employees, the project task was completed on schedule.

### 兰新路黄河便桥工程完工

    兰新路黄河便桥工程完工
    兰（州）新（疆）铁路黄河便桥工程，自去年十一月一日动工，经过两个多月的紧张施工，已于一月十日胜利完工。
    黄河便桥是兰新铁路线上最大的关键工程之一。桥梁高出水面十三公尺，附近水流湍急，施工很困难。去年十月，西北铁路干线工程局第三工程队接受了这个工程任务后，一直是紧张地在零度以下的寒冷天气里施工。由于他们认真地采用了苏联先进经验，以沉箱代替桥墩，在木排架上架设钢梁，工程进展很快。桥梁的基础工程在去年年底就完成了。
    在施工中，因为贯彻了干部与工人结合，政治与技术结合的方针，展开红旗竞赛，大大地鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情，使生产不断提高。如机械联队由于批判了保守思想，订立了师徒合同和师徒爱国公约，徒工迅速掌握了技术，工作不断提高，因而两度被评为优胜单位，荣获红旗和奖金等奖励。政治工作干部也自动轮流巡夜，使工程顺利进行。经过全体职工两个多月的积极努力，按期完成了工程任务。
