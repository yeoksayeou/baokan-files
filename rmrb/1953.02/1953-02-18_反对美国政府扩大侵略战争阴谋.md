The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Calls for a Nationwide People's Peace Movement Demanding the Immediate Cessation of the Korean War

[Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] News: Eisenhower's policy of expanding the war of aggression in the Far East continues to be opposed in Japan. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with approximately three million members, held a council meeting in Tokyo on the 10th. The meeting considered that Eisenhower's announcement of a policy of using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to harass the Chinese mainland poses a danger of expanding the war in Asia. The meeting decided to launch a vigorous peace movement and decided to issue a "Letter to Trade Unions of All Countries for the Immediate Resolution of the Korean War" to trade unions around the world. The letter stated: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the peace forces of the Japanese people unanimously oppose war in Asia and demand an immediate struggle against all reactionary policies at home and abroad to quickly achieve world peace. The letter also stated that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will launch a nationwide Japanese people's peace movement demanding the immediate cessation of the Korean War.

The National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions of the United States Demands Immediate Cessation of the War of Aggression Against Korea

[Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th] The New York "Daily Worker" reported on the 11th that the National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions of the United States recently held its 83rd大会. At the meeting, a demand was made for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, with the issue of prisoners of war to be resolved at a later date.

The National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions of the United States believes that Eisenhower's policy of intensifying aggression against the Chinese people by using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang seems "to be opening the door to expanding the Korean War, rather than seeking a quick end to the war." The organization wrote to Eisenhower and members of the U.S. Congress, requesting direct talks between the U.S. President and Chairman Stalin in order to convene a Five-Power Conference.

The British "Daily Worker" Calls on People to Support the Proposal for an Immediate Ceasefire in Korea

Xinhua News Agency reported: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 10th, pointing out that the steps Eisenhower is now taking to expand the war are precisely the consistent demands of MacArthur and other important warmongers over the past two years. The reason why the American generals are so stubborn on the issue of prisoners of war is not because they care about the prisoners of war, but because they want the war to continue so that they can try out their proud strategies. But if the proposal for a ceasefire and a political conference on the issue of prisoners of war is accepted, the British government can at least send representatives to negotiations directly related to the lives and well-being of British soldiers.

The editorial finally called on all those who oppose Eisenhower's evil policies to support the proposal of first a ceasefire in Korea and then talks on the issue of prisoners of war, because this is the only way to prevent the war from engulfing all mankind.

Canadian People Launch Movement Demanding a Ceasefire in Korea

[Xinhua News Agency, 17th] According to TASS, Ottawa: A movement demanding a ceasefire in Korea has been launched in Canada.

The Canadian Peace Congress bulletin "Peace News" reported: James Endicott's suggestion to make February 28th a day to strive for a ceasefire in Korea has received widespread support from the Canadian people. Citizens in several constituencies intend to meet with Members of Parliament to discuss the proposal for a ceasefire in Korea.

In Saskatchewan, peace activists have sent out thousands of postcards asking the province's premier to propose an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

The Peace Council of British Columbia conducted a poll among 2,667 people, of whom 86 percent favored an immediate ceasefire in Korea; 82 percent believed that the possibility of peace would be much greater if weapons of mass slaughter, such as atomic bombs, napalm bombs, and bacteriological weapons, were prohibited; and 99 percent favored Canada's trade with all countries.

The Vice-Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, Eva Sanderson, has sent a telegram to Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, asking the government to suggest a ceasefire in Korea and to resolve all outstanding issues through consultation.

    反对美国政府扩大侵略战争阴谋
    日本工会总评议会号召展开全国人民要求立即停止朝鲜战争的和平运动
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：艾森豪威尔扩大远东侵略战争的政策，在日本继续遭到反对。拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会于十日在东京举行评议员会议。会议认为艾森豪威尔宣布利用蒋介石匪帮窜扰中国大陆的政策，有扩大亚洲战争的危险。会议决定展开强有力的和平运动，并决定向世界各国工会发出“为立即解决朝鲜战争告世界各国工会书”。这个文告说：日本工会总评议会和日本全国人民的和平力量一致反对亚洲战争，要求立即和国内外的一切反动政策进行斗争，以迅速实现世界和平。文告并表示：日本工会总评议会要展开日本全国人民要求立即停止朝鲜战争的和平运动。
    美国艺术、科学及自由职业全国委员会要求立即停止侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】纽约“工人日报”十一日报道，美国艺术、科学及自由职业全国委员会最近举行了第八十三届大会，会上要求在朝鲜立即停火，而战俘问题留待日后解决。
    美国艺术、科学及自由职业全国委员会认为，艾森豪威尔企图利用蒋介石匪帮加紧对中国人民的侵略行动的政策，似乎“是打开了扩大朝鲜战争的门，而不是求得战争的迅速结束”。这个组织写信给艾森豪威尔及美国国会议员，要求美国总统和斯大林主席直接会谈，以便召开五大国会议。
    英国“工人日报”号召人民拥护在朝鲜立即停火的建议
    据新华社讯：伦敦“工人日报”十日发表社论指出：艾森豪威尔现在所采取的扩大战争的步骤，正是麦克阿瑟和其他重要的黩武主义者过去两年来的一贯主张。美国将军们之所以在战俘问题上这样顽固，并不是因为他们关心战俘，而是因为他们想让战争继续下去，使他们能够试行他们的得意的战略。但是如果接受停火和召开关于战俘问题的政治会议的建议，英国政府就至少可以派代表参加直接关系到英国士兵的生命和幸福的谈判。
    社论最后号召所有反对艾森豪威尔的罪恶政策的人拥护先在朝鲜停火后谈战俘问题的建议，因为这是防止战争席卷全人类的唯一办法。
    加拿大人民展开要求在朝鲜停火运动
     【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社渥太华讯：加拿大展开了要求在朝鲜停火的运动。
    加拿大和平大会公报“和平新闻”报道：文幼章建议以二月二十八日为争取在朝鲜停火的日子，这个建议获得了加拿大人民广泛的支持。好几个选区的公民们都打算和议会议员们会晤，以便讨论关于在朝鲜停火的建议。
    在萨斯喀彻温省，和平战士们发出了成千张明信片，要求该省总理提出立即在朝鲜停火的建议。
    英属哥伦比亚省的和平理事会在二千六百六十七人中间举行了民意测验，其中百分之八十六主张立即在朝鲜停火；百分之八十二认为如果禁止原子弹、凝固汽油弹和细菌武器等大规模屠杀的武器，和平的可能性就要大得多；百分之九十九的人都主张加拿大和各国贸易。
    加拿大和平大会副主席伊娃·山德逊已经打电报给加拿大总理圣劳伦，要求政府建议在朝鲜停火，并且用协商办法解决一切悬而未决的问题。
