    The main tasks of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation's visit to the Soviet Union are: to understand and learn from the Soviet Union's organizational leadership experience in scientific research and to strengthen the ties and cooperation in scientific work between the two countries. The delegation consists of twenty-six representatives in total: Hua Luogeng (Mathematics), Zhang Yuzhe (Astronomy), Zhao Jiuzhang (Meteorology), Liu Xianyi (Chemistry), Peng Shaoyi (Chemistry), Song Ying (Geology), Zhang Wenyou (Geology), Wu Heng (Geology), Feng Depei (Physiology), Shen Jichun (Physiology), Xue Gongchuo (Physiology), Bei Shizhang (Biology), Zhu Xi (Biology), Wu Zhengfu (Botany), Ma Rongzhi (Soil Science), Shen Qizhen (Medicine), Chen Yingu (Electrical Engineering), Yu Daowen (Mechanical Engineering), Liang Sicheng (Architecture), Cao Yanxing (Civil Engineering), Li Shijun (Agronomy), Zhang Jiafu (History), Liu Danian (History), Lu Shuxiang (Linguistics), and Zhang Bochuan (Education).
    As early as October 3rd of last year, the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences held a meeting to discuss further expanding and strengthening scientific ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also held an expanded presidential meeting on October 24th of last year to discuss strengthening the learning and introduction of advanced Soviet science and technology. At the meeting, it was also decided to organize a delegation to visit the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In November of last year, the Soviet Academy of Sciences formally invited Chinese scientists to organize a delegation to the Soviet Union. The Chinese Academy of Sciences immediately began organizational work. After the formation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, it conducted learning and preparation work related to the visit to the Soviet Union. It is expected that this visit by the delegation will further develop the ties and cooperation in scientific research between China and the Soviet Union.

    【新华社二十四日讯】中国科学院访苏代表团由团长物理学家钱三强率领，于二十四日自北京出发赴苏联。到车站欢送的有：中国科学院院长郭沫若，副院长李四光、陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训，中国科学技术普及协会副主席陈凤桐，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会办公厅主任徐迈进等。苏联驻华大使馆参赞顾德夫也到站欢送。
    中国科学院访苏代表团此行的主要任务是：了解和学习苏联科学研究方面的组织领导经验和加强两国科学工作的联系与合作。全团代表共二十六人：华罗庚（数学）、张钰哲（天文学）、赵九章（气象学）、刘咸一（化学）、彭少逸（化学）、宋应
    （地质学）、张文佑（地质学）、武衡（地质学）、冯德培（生理学）、沈霁春（生理学）、薛公绰
    （生理学）、贝时璋（生物学）、朱洗（生物学）、吴徵镒（植物学）、马溶之（土壤学）、沈其震
