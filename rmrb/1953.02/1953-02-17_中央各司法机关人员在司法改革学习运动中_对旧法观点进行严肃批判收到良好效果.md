In early October of last year, the central judicial organs began a judicial reform study movement. First, they spent more than a month studying documents such as "On Practice" to master weapons for examining work and criticizing ideology. From December 1st of last year, they launched exposure and criticism through various methods such as conferences, small meetings, and case investigations. The movement basically ended at the end of last year.

During the movement, thanks to the attention and hands-on involvement of party and administrative leaders, the masses were fully mobilized, case files were carefully reviewed, and materials were mastered. Then, a fierce struggle was waged against old legal views and old judicial styles, and thorough exposure and criticism were made. At the same time, various incorrect attitudes and thoughts were promptly corrected and criticized during the movement, thus ensuring the healthy progress of the movement.

From the problems exposed, it can be seen that serious old legal views and old judicial styles existed in all aspects of judging cases, drafting regulations, and implementing policies. For example, someone emphasized in his draft of the "General Principles of Criminal Law" (unpublished) that the purpose of criminal law was not to protect the people, but to protect "individuals," that is, landlord class elements, bureaucratic bourgeois elements, and counter-revolutionary elements were also included in the protection. Someone believed that "although the political rights of counter-revolutionary elements have been deprived, their right to litigate has not been deprived." Regarding illegal landlord elements who dispersed land and sabotaged land reform when land reform was about to begin, some advocated "the law does not apply retroactively" and "there is no punishment without explicit legal provisions." Some also believed that illegal capitalists persecuted workers to death, but the "case was not serious," and advocated revoking the original sentence of imprisonment and changing it to "education and release." These people had studied, worked, or taught old law for a long time, and old legal views were deeply rooted in their thinking. They often consciously or unconsciously recognized and dealt with problems from the perspective of old legal views, thus causing losses to work, and some cadres were also affected by them. For example, the result of the Supreme People's Court's case review this time is that as many as sixty-five cases have been definitely misjudged or may have been misjudged (and are currently under investigation and handling); an old judicial officer of the Ministry of Justice copied ninety-four kinds of litigation paper formats from the old court and sent down thirty-six kinds, causing a lot of trouble to people's courts in various places. Some veteran cadres and young intellectuals who had not studied old law also learned to write old-style judgments under this influence and acted according to the old "litigation procedures." Some people even went to buy old "legal dictionaries" and other books to "study." After analysis and criticism, everyone clearly recognized the errors of those so-called "supra-class" and "supra-political" views such as "everyone is equal before the law" and "judicial independence." In addition, many problems were also exposed in terms of systems and styles. After analysis and criticism, everyone also clearly recognized that those "procedures," "processes," and "official jargon" that were said to maintain "legal seriousness" were nothing more than the products of those reactionary legal views and were means of binding and making things difficult for the working people.

In the past three years, the work of the central judicial organs has achieved considerable results, and it has also continuously struggled against old legal views and old judicial styles. For example, after the "Three-Anti" movement, personnel reorganization was carried out, and some necessary rectification was carried out in the organization. During the party rectification in the organs, a struggle against old legal views was launched within the party, thoroughly settling the serious old legal views of individual party cadres who were quite responsible in administration, improving the ideological level of party cadres, and drawing a clear line between new and old laws, which greatly educated both party and non-party cadres. In previous movements, a group of bad elements with serious crimes, deep-rooted bad habits, and irredeemable were successively dealt with according to law and purged from the organization. This judicial reform study movement once again severely attacked old legal views and old judicial styles, established the people's legal views and the style of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, further clarified the issue of business ideology and policies, and created favorable conditions for leading the development of people's judicial work nationwide in the future. At present, the central judicial organs have begun new studies, strengthening ideological construction, further establishing and consolidating the people's legal views and the style of serving the people; on the one hand, they are actively summarizing the experience of the national judicial reform movement and people's judicial work, and specifically studying a number of issues related to the construction of people's judiciary, preparing to systematically build the national people's judicial work from the organization and system through the upcoming Second National Judicial Conference. Before the start of the inspection phase, the Supreme People's Court published a notice calling on the masses to report problems in the court, and soon received more than 300 letters from the masses, of which more than 100 reported deviations in the handling of cases. In order to seriously handle these cases and the problematic cases found in the judicial reform, the Supreme People's Court has recently extracted a large number of cadres to form working groups, first to Hebei, Tianjin, and Beijing, to conduct investigations and studies by adopting the mass line and on-site trials, to revise those cases that are indeed wrong and must be retried, and at the same time clean up backlog cases. In order to study how to further play the role of political and legal work in the upcoming large-scale economic construction, the five central political and legal joint offices (Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, Ministry of Justice, Legislative Affairs Committee) have sent working groups to conduct on-site investigations and study the situation and problems of promoting judicial work in industrial and mining areas.

### 中央各司法机关人员在司法改革学习运动中  对旧法观点进行严肃批判收到良好效果

    中央各司法机关人员在司法改革学习运动中
    对旧法观点进行严肃批判收到良好效果
    去年十月初，中央各司法机关开始了司法改革的学习运动。首先以一个多月的时间学习了“实践论”等文件，做为掌握检查工作、批判思想的武器。从去年十二月一日起，通过大会、小会、查案等各种方式，展开揭发、批判，运动于去年年底基本结束。
    在运动当中，由于党和行政领导干部的重视和亲自动手，充分发动了群众，认真地翻查了案卷，掌握了材料，然后与旧法观点、旧司法作风进行了激烈的斗争，作了彻底的揭发和批判。同时，在运动当中，也及时纠正和批判了各种不正确的态度和思想，因而保证了运动的健康进展。
    从揭发出来的问题看，在审判案件、起草法规、执行政策各方面，都存在着严重的旧法观点和旧司法作风。如有人在他起草的“刑法大纲”（未公布）中，强调刑法的目的不是保护人民，而是保护“个人”，就是说，地主阶级分子、官僚资产阶级分子、反革命分子也在保护之列。有人认为：“反革命分子的政治权利虽已被剥夺，但并未剥夺其诉讼权”。对在土地改革即将开始时分散土地、破坏土地改革的不法地主分子，有人主张“法律不溯既往”，“法无明文不罚”。也有人认为不法资本家迫害工人致死，还是“案情既非重大”，而主张撤销原审所判徒刑，改判“教育释放”。这些人过去长期学过、做过或教过旧法，旧法观点在他们的思想中已根深蒂固，经常自觉或不自觉地以旧法观点认识问题和处理问题，因而使工作受到损失，某些干部也受到他们的影响。如最高人民法院这次查案结果，已肯定是错判或可能错判的案件即达六十五件（现正调查处理中）；司法部某旧司法人员把旧法院的诉讼用纸格式抄了九十四种，发下去三十六种，给各地人民法院添了很多麻烦。有些没有学过旧法的老干部和青年知识分子，在这种影响下也来学写旧式判决，按照旧的“诉讼程序”办事。还有人专门去买旧“法律辞典”等书来“学习”。经过分析批判之后，大家明确地认识到那些“法律面前人人平等”、“司法独立”等等所谓“超阶级”、“超政治”观点的错误。此外，在制度、作风方面，也揭发出不少的问题，经过分析批判，也使大家明确地认识到那些据说是为了保持“法律严肃性”的“手续”、“程序”和“官腔”，也不过是那些反动的法律观点的产物，是束缚和刁难劳动人民的手段罢了。
    三年来，中央各司法机关的工作曾经取得了相当的成绩，并且也和旧法观点、旧司法作风不断的做过一些斗争。如在“三反”运动之后，进行了人事整编，在组织上做了一些必要的整顿。在机关整党中，曾在党内展开了反对旧法观点的斗争，彻底清算了个别在行政上相当负责的党员干部的严重的旧法观点，提高了党员干部的思想水平，划清了新旧法律的界限，使党与非党干部都受到很大教育。在历次运动中，也曾从组织上陆续法办和清洗了一批罪恶严重、恶习甚深、不堪改造的坏分子。这次司法改革学习运动，又一次严重地打击了旧法观点、旧司法作风，树立了人民的法律观点与调查研究、实事求是的作风，进一步明确了业务思想方针问题，给今后领导全国开展人民司法工作创造了有利的条件。目前，中央各司法机关一方面已开始了新的学习，加强思想建设，进一步树立和巩固人民的法律观点和为人民服务的作风；一方面正在积极总结全国司法改革运动和人民司法工作的经验，具体研究若干有关人民司法建设的问题，准备通过不久即将召开的第二次全国司法会议，从组织上和制度上系统地建设全国的人民司法工作。最高人民法院在检查阶段开始前，曾登报号召群众检举该院的问题，不久即收到群众来信三百余件，其中检举处理案件有偏差的即达一百余件。最高人民法院为了认真处理这些案件和在司法改革中检查出有问题的案件，日前已抽出大批干部，组成工作组，首先分赴河北、天津、北京三地，采取走群众路线、就地审判的方式，进行调查研究，把那些确有错误、必须改判的案件加以改判，同时结合清理积案。为了研究如何进一步发挥政法工作在今后大规模经济建设当中的作用，中央政法合署五机关（最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、政务院政法委员会、司法部、法制委员会）已派出工作组，实地调查并研究在工矿区推进司法工作的情况和问题。
