    It is Necessary to Broadly Attract the Masses to Carry Out Criticism in Newspapers
    In the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, our newspapers should attract millions of people to conduct bottom-up criticism and supervision. Recent situations in newspapers in various regions show that the more people are attracted, the more profound the exposure of various shortcomings and errors, and the better the results. Therefore, the degree of mass mobilization has become an important key to the effectiveness of conducting criticism in newspapers.
    Shanghai’s Liberation Daily, Zhejiang Daily, and others, by mobilizing the masses relatively fully, have achieved great results in the struggle against bureaucracy. After the Shanghai Liberation Daily announced the Huang Yifeng incident, from January 21st to January 28th, the number of letters received from readers each day surged from 300 to 500-700. Among these readers' letters, there were 43 cases exposing serious bureaucratic behavior, coercive orders, and violations of law and discipline by cadres at or above the county level in various parts of East China and various agencies; and there were 881 letters related to the Huang Yifeng incident. These readers' letters unanimously supported the East China Bureau's handling of the incident and expressed their determination to resolutely participate in the anti-bureaucracy struggle.
    The announcement and handling of the Huang Yifeng incident was not only a powerful encouragement to the broad masses in Shanghai and other provinces in East China, but also a great encouragement to the masses across the country. As long as the newspapers in these areas can seize the opportunity to develop mass work, the masses' letters will not only "flow endlessly" to the editorial departments, but also the masses' courage to participate in the anti-bureaucracy struggle will emerge like a spring. The Northeast Daily published a letter from Zhang Rongchun of the Jinzhou Railway Administration, saying: "The People's Daily editorial on January 23rd, 'Those Who Suppress Criticism are the Party's Mortal Enemies,' and the 'Decision on Disciplinary Actions Against Relevant Leaders Regarding the Suppression of Student Criticism Incident at the East China Transportation College' by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, greatly enhanced the courage and confidence of the masses to fight against those who suppress criticism; at the same time, it also alerted those bureaucratic elements who suppress and ignore mass criticism. For example, Liu Qixun, a staff member of the Jinzhou Railway Administration Bureau Director's Office, after reading the People's Daily on that day, immediately checked his drawer to see if there were any letters from the masses that had been held up; as a result, he found an important letter of complaint and criticism that had been held up for more than ten months. This time he panicked and quickly took the letter to the Party Committee for research and handling. The matter has now been quickly dealt with, and the accused has received the punishment he deserves. Then Liu Qixun found the complainant, introduced the handling situation to him, and made a self-criticism. Then he breathed a sigh of relief. In the past, I and several comrades had exposed a bureaucratic element who suppressed criticism, but he did not seriously correct his mistakes, nor did he receive the punishment he deserved. This time we will continue to fight him. One day, a comrade from the Jinzhou Railway Public Security Office saw me, and while taking out the People's Daily of January 23rd from his pocket, he said to me: 'Old Zhang, have you read this People's Daily? Those who suppress criticism have been punished by Party discipline! The person we exposed in the past who suppressed criticism has not seriously reviewed and corrected his shortcomings, this time we should further boldly expose him!'" This fully reflects the masses' enthusiasm for criticism.
    However, many newspapers above the provincial and municipal level only published the news and editorials of the Huang Yifeng incident after our newspaper announced it on January 23rd, and did not continue to attract the broad masses to participate, so as to further promote the local struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. These newspapers are: Beijing Daily, Tianjin Daily, Shanxi Daily, Suiyuan Daily, Inner Mongolia Daily in North China; Shenyang Daily, Liaodong Mass Daily, Songjiang Daily, Changchun New Daily, Jilin Daily, Lushun-Dalian People's Daily in Northeast China; Southern Daily, Guangzhou Daily, Guangxi Daily, Jiangxi Daily, Hubei Daily, Henan Daily, Yangtze River Daily in Central and South China; Mass Daily, Ningxia Daily, Qinghai Daily in Northwest China.
    The reason why the newspapers in these areas have not or have not fully exerted the role of mass criticism is not because there are no negative and backward phenomena locally, nor because the editorial departments have not grasped the criticism materials reflected by the masses; but because the editorial departments of these newspapers, such as Chongqing Xinhua Daily and Northwest Mass Daily, unilaterally believe that local party newspapers are directly led by the local party committees, so they must wait for the local party committees to make arrangements or handle the materials exposed by the masses before they dare to publicly criticize them. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily editorial department also believes that not doing so will "disrupt" the work. Therefore, they did not pay attention to the opinions of the masses on the Huang Yifeng incident, and did not publish them. Obviously, this understanding and practice of these newspaper editorial departments is incorrect.
    We must clearly recognize that the role of our Party newspapers is not only to publish the Party's decisions, instructions and the results of handling everything to the people every day; it should also delve into the people, mobilize the broad masses, raise questions based on the opinions reflected by the people, attract the attention of the Party Committee, and turn them into the opinions and decisions of the Party Committee. As early as April 19, 1950, the CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," which clearly stipulated that "All criticisms published in newspapers and publications shall be independently responsible by the reporters and editors of the newspapers and publications." "As long as the newspapers and publications confirm that such criticism is basically correct, even if they have not solicited or obtained the consent of the criticized, they should still be responsible for publishing it." That is to say, the editorial department should "bear independent responsibility" for publishing criticism in newspapers, which is the task that our Party has entrusted to newspapers. Therefore, this matter cannot be opposed to the Party's political and organizational leadership over the editorial department.
    Secondly, we must also clearly recognize that vigorously attracting the masses to criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers will not only not damage the prestige of the Party and the state, or "disrupt" our work; on the contrary, it will further consolidate the Party's ties with the people and promote the development of the anti-bureaucracy struggle. Facts have proved that if newspapers do not attract the broad masses to participate in the struggle, then it will be impossible to receive 43 pieces of exposure materials in a week like the Shanghai Liberation Daily; those bureaucratic elements who occupy a certain leading position will not be "brought to the sunlight" so quickly. Lenin taught us that "If we want to fight bureaucracy, we should attract the masses from below to participate in this struggle" because "what other way is there to abolish bureaucracy without attracting workers and peasants to participate?" Our Party Central Committee also emphasized in the "Decision on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications": "Attracting the people to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and publications, and educating Party members, especially Party cadres, to make self-criticism on these shortcomings and errors in newspapers and publications, is even more prominently important today." The Party Central Committee's regulations are so clear, but there are still many newspaper editorial departments that dare not fully develop mass criticism in newspapers. In addition to the situation where the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee restricts newspaper criticism, in the editorial department, it is because they lack political courage.
    Attracting the people to criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers is not a temporary crash movement, but a long-term struggle in our national life. Therefore, the editorial departments of newspapers in various regions should review the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," thoroughly overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, and fundamentally change the working methods of the editorial departments, that is, replace the "lone wolf" and detached from the masses method with the large-scale propaganda method of mobilizing the masses, so as to create favorable conditions for the propaganda of large-scale economic construction.

### 必须广泛吸引群众在报纸上展开批评

    必须广泛吸引群众在报纸上展开批评
    在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，我们的报纸应当吸引千百万群众来进行自下而上的批评和监督。最近各地报纸的情况表明：凡吸引群众越多，对于各种缺点和错误揭露就越深刻，效果也就越好。因此，发动群众的程度如何，就成为在报纸上展开批评的成效大小的一个重要关键。
    上海解放日报、浙江日报等，比较充分地发动了群众，就使报纸在反官僚主义斗争方面，取得了很大成效。上海解放日报在公布黄逸峰事件后，从一月二十一日到一月二十八日，每天收到的读者来信，已由三百件激增至五百件到七百件。在这些读者来信中，揭发华东各地、各机关中县级以上干部的严重官僚主义、强迫命令和违法乱纪的行为，即有四十三起；而有关黄逸峰事件的来信则达八百八十一件。这些读者来信一致拥护华东局对这一事件的处理，并表示要坚决地参加反官僚主义斗争。
    黄逸峰事件的公布和处理，不仅对上海、对华东各省广大群众是一个有力的鼓舞，而且对全国各地群众也是一个很大的鼓舞。只要这些地区的报纸能够抓紧开展群众工作，群众的来信不但会“川流不息”地送到编辑部，而且群众参加反官僚主义斗争的勇气也会像喷泉一样地涌现出来。东北日报发表了锦州铁路管理局张荣春的来信说：“一月二十三日人民日报发表的‘压制批评的人是党的死敌’的社论，和中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会‘关于华东交通专科学校压制学生批评事件对有关领导人员处分的决定’，大大增强了群众向压制批评者作斗争的勇气和信心；同时，也警惕了那些压制和忽视群众批评的官僚主义分子。如锦州铁路管理局局长办公室的工作人员刘启勋，看了这天的人民日报，马上就检查他抽屉里是否积压群众来信；结果发现有封重要的检举、批评信压了十个多月。这回他发了慌，赶紧拿着信到党委会去研究处理。目前已迅速把这件事处理完了，被检举者受到应得的处分。接着刘启勋又找到了检举人，向他介绍了处理情况，作了检讨。然后才松了一口气。过去我曾经和几个同志揭发过一个压制批评的官僚主义分子，他并没有认真改正错误，也没有得到应有的处理，这次我们要继续和他作斗争。有一天，锦州铁路公安处有个同志见了我，一面从兜里往外掏一月二十三日的人民日报，一面向我说：‘老张，你看过这张人民日报么？压制批评的分子受到党纪的制裁啦！我们过去揭发的那个压制批评的人没有认真检讨、改正缺点，这回我们该进一步大胆揭发他啦！’”这就充分反映了群众对于批评的积极性。
    但还有不少省市以上的报纸，从本报一月二十三日公布黄逸峰事件后，只刊登了这一事件的新闻和社论，并没有由此继续吸引广大群众参加，去进一步推动当地的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。这些报纸是：华北区的北京日报、天津日报、山西日报、绥远日报、内蒙古日报；东北区的沈阳日报、辽东大众报、松江日报、长春新报、吉林日报、旅大人民日报；中南区的南方日报、广州日报、广西日报、江西日报、湖北日报、河南日报、长江日报；西北区的群众日报、宁夏日报、青海日报。
    这些地区的报纸所以没有或尚未充分发挥群众性批评的作用，并不是因为当地没有消极落后的现象，也不是因为编辑部没有掌握到群众反映的批评材料；而是因为这些报纸编辑部，如重庆新华日报、西北群众日报等片面地认为：地方党报受地方党委直接领导，因而对群众揭发的材料，必须等当地党委作了布置，或进行了处理，才敢公开进行批评。重庆新华日报编辑部还认为，不这样就会把工作“搞乱”。所以他们对群众反映的对黄逸峰事件的意见，没有引起注意，没有予以发表。显然，这些报纸编辑部的这种认识和作法是不正确的。
    我们必须明确认识，我们的党报的作用，并不仅仅在于天天向人民群众发布党的决定、指示和对一切事情处理的结果；它还应该钻到人民群众中去，发动广大群众，根据人民群众反映的意见，提出问题，引起党委的注意，并变成党委的意见和决定。早在一九五○年四月十九日中共中央发布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中，即明确规定：“凡在报纸刊物上公布的批评，都由报纸刊物的记者和编者负独立的责任。”“只要报纸刊物确认这种批评在基本上是正确的，即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意，仍然应当负责加以发表。”这就是说，报纸发表批评，编辑部应“负独立的责任”，这就是我们的党交给报纸的任务。因此，不能把这事和党在政治上组织上对编辑部的领导对立起来。
    其次，我们还必须明确认识，大力吸引群众在报纸上批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，不但不会损害党和国家的威信，“搞乱”我们的工作；相反地，它将会更加巩固党与人民群众的联系，推动反官僚主义斗争的开展。事实证明，如果报纸不吸引广大群众参加斗争，那末，要像上海解放日报一样在一周之内收到四十三件揭发材料的情形，就将是不可能的；那些占据一定领导地位的官僚主义者，也不会这样迅速地被“拉到日光下来”。列宁曾教导我们说：“如果我们想与官僚主义作斗争，我们就应当吸引下层群众来参加这个斗争”因为“不吸引工人和农民来参加，还有其他什么办法可以废止官僚主义呢？”我们的党中央在“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中，也曾强调指出：“吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并教育党员、特别是党的干部在报纸刊物上作关于这些缺点和错误的自我批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。”党中央的规定是这样的明确，可是至今还有许多报纸编辑部不敢在报纸上充分展开群众性的批评。这除了像中共鞍山市委那样限制报纸批评的情况以外，在编辑部来说，就是因为他们缺乏政治胆量。
    吸引人民群众在报纸上批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并不是一个临时性的突击运动，而是我们国家生活中一个长期性的斗争。因此，各地报纸编辑部应重温党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，彻底克服上述缺点，并从根本上把编辑部的工作方法加以改变，即用发动群众的大规模宣传的方法代替“孤军作战”的脱离群众的方法，从而为大规模经济建设的宣传创造顺利条件。
