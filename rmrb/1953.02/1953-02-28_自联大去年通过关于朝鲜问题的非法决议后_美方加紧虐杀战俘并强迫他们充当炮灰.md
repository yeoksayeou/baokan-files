Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 27th: Since the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed the illegal resolution on the Korean issue on December 3rd of last year, with the support and encouragement of this resolution, the US aggressors have become even more unscrupulous in forcibly detaining prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder, and have therefore intensified the massacre and persecution of prisoners of war. According to the US side's own disclosure, from December 4th of last year to February 24th of this year, the day the UN General Assembly reconvened, the US side killed and wounded another 286 prisoners of war in prisoner of war camps in Geoje Island, Beongam Island, Jeju Island, Busan, Sangmudae, etc.

Because the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly completely supports the US side's so-called "no forced repatriation" "principle," which is actually forced detention of prisoners of war, the US side felt confident enough to force prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder on a larger scale, thus leading to the unprecedented massacre of prisoners of war on Beongam Island on December 14th of last year. In this incident, as many as 202 prisoners of war were killed and wounded, reaching the peak of the US side's record of massacring prisoners of war. According to information revealed by the US side and the facts admitted by Miller, the commander of the US Beongam Island prisoner of war camp, the reason this incident occurred was because the US side attempted to transfer a large number of prisoners of war on the island to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Before the massacre took place, the US prisoner of war camp authorities had been preparing for a week. According to the Associated Press, Harrison, the chief US representative for the armistice negotiations, also bearing a "secret mission related to the prisoner of war issue," made a special trip from Tokyo to South Korea to "visit UN prisoner of war camps and inspect the facilities at Busan Port." However, this US conspiracy to force prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder was met with heroic resistance from our captured personnel. Even under the insane fire of US light machine guns, shotguns, carbines, and rifles, the prisoners of war still stubbornly stood arm in arm, using singing to express their firm will to refuse to serve as cannon fodder and resolutely demand repatriation.

After the Beongam Island incident, the US side, on the one hand, published an absurd "intelligence report" fabricated entirely by US intelligence agencies, attempting to shirk responsibility for the massacre of prisoners of war, and on the other hand, continued to use special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs in the prisoner of war camps to massacre and persecute prisoners of war under various pretexts, even using debilitating new-style chemical weapons to attack prisoners of war. On February 9th, the US side used this weapon against prisoners of war on Geoje Island, causing 39 prisoners of war to be killed or injured. However, Caldwell, the commander of the US prisoner of war camp, actually said that this was an "extremely humane means" by the US side.

The sole purpose of all these US atrocities in violation of the Geneva Convention is to create so-called prisoners of war who "refuse repatriation," forcibly detain them, and send them to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to serve as cannon fodder. With the reconvening of the United Nations General Assembly, this activity has been intensified. According to the Associated Press, the Syngman Rhee puppet government admitted on February 24th that they were forcing captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to "sign their names in their own blood on a petition," "demanding" to participate in "fighting against the Communist army." It is quite obvious that, in addition to the US side arbitrarily "releasing" captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side and forcing them to join the Rhee puppet army, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's special agents planted by the US side in the prisoner of war camps are continuing to carry out the orders of the US military headquarters, following the criminal acts of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's special agents, forcing prisoners of war to write blood letters, in order to use the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly to further send a large number of prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee puppet army to serve as cannon fodder for the US in carrying out its war of aggression against Korea.

Observers here point out that the US side has twice last year used "release" as a pretext to force 38,000 prisoners of war to join the Syngman Rhee puppet army. We have sufficient personal testimonies regarding this serious crime of the US side in violation of the Geneva Convention. After the United Nations General Assembly passed the unreasonable proposition supporting the US side's forced detention of prisoners of war, the United States is clearly intensifying its efforts to forcibly detain prisoners of war by means of torture and killing and transfer them to the Chiang-Rhee bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder.

### 自联大去年通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议后  美方加紧虐杀战俘并强迫他们充当炮灰

    自联大去年通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议后
    美方加紧虐杀战俘并强迫他们充当炮灰
    【新华社开城二十七日电】联合国第七届大会在去年十二月三日通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案。在这个决议案的支持和鼓励之下，美国侵略者更加肆无忌惮地强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰，并因此而加紧屠杀和迫害战俘。仅据美方自己透露，从去年十二月四日，到今年二月二十四日联合国大会复会那天为止，美方在巨济岛、蜂岩岛、济州岛、釜山、尚武台等战俘营中，就又打死打伤了战俘二百八十六人。
    由于联合国大会通过的非法决议案完全支持美方名为“不强迫遣返”实则强迫扣留战俘的“原则”，美方就放心大胆地用更大的规模强迫战俘充当炮灰，因此发生了去年十二月十四日蜂岩岛的空前屠杀战俘事件。在这次事件中，战俘被打死打伤二百零二人之多，达到美方屠杀战俘纪录的最高峰。根据美方透露的消息，和美方蜂岩岛战俘营司令米勒所承认的事实，这次事件所以发生，是因为美方企图将岛上的战俘大批移交给李承晚匪帮。在屠杀进行以前，美方战俘营当局曾经作了一个星期的准备。据美联社报道，美方停战谈判首席代表哈利逊并且负着“与战俘问题有关的秘密使命”，特地从东京赶到南朝鲜去“访问联合国军战俘营并视察釜山港的设备”。但是美方这种强迫战俘充当炮灰的阴谋，遭到了我方被俘人员的英勇抗拒。即使在美方轻机关枪、散弹枪、卡宾枪和步枪的疯狂射击之下，战俘们仍然顽强不屈地臂挽着臂，用唱歌来表示他们拒绝充当炮灰、坚决要求遣返的坚定意志。
    在蜂岩岛事件以后，美方一方面发表由美国特务机关一手捏造出来的荒谬绝伦的“情报报告”，企图推卸屠杀战俘的责任，一方面继续在战俘营中利用李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子，在种种借口下屠杀和迫害战俘，甚至使用糜烂性的新式化学武器来向战俘进攻。二月九日，美方对巨济岛上的战俘使用这种武器，以致战俘死伤三十九人。而美方战俘营司令卡德维尔竟说，这是美方“极为人道的手段”。
    美方这一切违反日内瓦公约的暴行的唯一目的，是要制造所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘，强迫扣留他们并将他们送交李承晚蒋介石充当炮灰。随着联合国大会复会，这一活动已在加紧进行。据美联社报道，李承晚傀儡政府在二月二十四日承认他们正在强迫朝鲜人民军被俘人员“在一个请愿书上用他们自己的血签了名”，“要求”参加“对共军作战”。十分明显，美方除了将朝中方面被俘人员擅自“释放”并强迫他们加入李伪军之外，美方安插在战俘营中的李承晚匪帮特务，正在继续执行美军司令部的命令，依照蒋介石匪帮特务分子的罪恶行为，强迫战俘写血书，以便利用联合国大会的非法决议案，更进一步把大批战俘送交李承晚伪军，充当美国进行侵朝战争的炮灰。
    此间观察家指出，美方在去年曾经两次以“释放”为名，强迫三万八千名战俘参加李承晚伪军。关于美方这一违反日内瓦公约的严重罪行，我方已经握有充分的人证。在联合国大会通过了支持美方强迫扣留战俘的无理主张以后，美国显然是在更加紧以虐杀方法来强迫扣留战俘并将他们转送蒋李匪帮充当炮灰。
