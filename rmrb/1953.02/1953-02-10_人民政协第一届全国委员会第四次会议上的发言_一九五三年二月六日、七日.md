Speech by Wu Yaozong, Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC

    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I express my heartfelt support for the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the report by Deputy Head Guo Moruo on the proceedings and achievements of the World People's Peace Congress. Religious figures across the country will strive for the victorious completion of the tasks put forward in these reports.
    After more than three years of effort, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our country, through various great movements, has basically cleared away many revolutionary obstacles and entered a period of large-scale construction. This is something every Chinese person should celebrate. Now I would like to link the three great tasks we are to undertake in 1953 with the overall issue of world peace and express some opinions.
    In the past year or so, I have attended the World Peace Council twice and participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing last October. Recently, I also joined the Chinese delegation with representatives from Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Islam to attend the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna. Participating in these conferences was a good education and a great inspiration for me. If I could express the inspiration these conferences gave me in one sentence, it would be: War can be stopped; the awakening of the people, the will of the people, determines everything.
    In several regions of the world today—in Korea, in Vietnam, in Malaya—isn't imperialism waging the most barbaric wars? Aren't the warmongers clamoring all day long to continue and expand these wars? Besides these wars, aren't they constantly creating international tensions and engaging in their so-called Cold War? Can these mad, inhuman actions and plans of imperialism be stopped? The world peace movement of more than three years has given us an increasingly clear answer: Yes. Why do many peace-loving people in the world today still believe that war cannot be stopped? It is because they only know that historical ambitious figures can launch wars at will, they do not know that today the power of the people can stop wars; they only know the horror of atomic bombs, napalm bombs, and germ warfare, they do not know that the will of the people is a greater force. They do not know that war must be carried out by people, and if the people do not want war, war cannot be carried out.
    At the Vienna Congress, the attending representatives unanimously demanded an immediate end to the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya; unanimously demanded the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. Their demands are also the demands of the vast majority of people around the world. Representatives from colonial and semi-colonial countries angrily denounced the oppression and exploitation of the imperialist aggressors. Many countries that are nominally independent but have actually become colonies of the United States, such as various countries in Western Europe and Latin America, their people are also gradually realizing the disasters brought to them by the American aggressors. All of this proves that the power of the peace camp is growing stronger; as long as the people realize that they are being deceived and betrayed, they will unite to stop war and defend peace. Chairman Stalin's instruction is completely correct: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of safeguarding peace and carry this cause through to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    The birth and development of the People's Republic of China is the most vivid and powerful example of the growing strength of the forces defending world peace. In the past, many people regarded the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang over the Chinese people as very terrible, but the awakened Chinese people defeated them. In the early stages of the Korean War, there were also people who wanted us to "keep ourselves clean" and "mind our own business," but the facts of the past two years have proved that the power of the Chinese and Korean people is an invincible bastion of iron. This bastion of iron has greatly struck at the imperialist aggressive ambitions and seriously thwarted the imperialist aggressive plans.
    Among our three great tasks in 1953, continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea not only guarantees the security of our country but also guarantees the continued growth of the forces defending world peace; convening national and local people's congresses at all levels will make the already awakened Chinese people cherish their motherland even more and better exert their power as masters of their own affairs; carrying out basic economic construction will make our country no longer an economically backward country, but a modern country that can seek the greatest welfare for the people. Successfully completing these tasks is to place the new China on a bedrock, making it impossible for the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks to be realized, and providing a more powerful guarantee for world peace. All of this fully proves Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction: "American imperialism is a paper tiger." A paper tiger cannot frighten people; on the contrary, the awakening of the people, the will of the people, determines everything.
    What is gratifying is that the religious believers across the country, thanks to the powerful enlightenment of many objective facts, have gradually recognized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, recognized the hideous face of imperialism and its threat to world peace, and recognized the infinite wisdom and power of the liberated people. The "Three-Self" renovation movement of Christianity and Catholicism has educated the vast masses of believers, enabling them to begin to be liberated from the influence of imperialism and enthusiastically participate in various patriotic movements. Islam and Buddhism have also recently carried out national organizations with the aim of loving the country and loving religion. Under the policy of freedom of religious belief, and under the active leadership and assistance of the People's Government, these religions are all moving towards a new path. The era in which imperialism used religion to carry out aggression in our country is over; Chinese religion is no longer a tool of imperialism, but a force for defending peace. The imperialist slanderous propaganda about the religious situation in the new China will also be completely bankrupt in the face of ironclad facts. For these gratifying developments, we cannot but sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. To express our gratitude, we are willing to participate with the greatest strength in all work of building the new China and defending world peace.

Speech by Wang Yunsheng, Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC

    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    After listening to the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the report by Deputy Head Guo Moruo on the World People's Peace Congress, we have a clear understanding of the three major tasks currently facing the country, and we have strengthened our confidence in the great construction of the country and the cause of world peace. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and support here.
    The Fourth Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is being held at this time to formally propose the three major national tasks for 1953 to the people of the whole country: calling on us to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, announcing the start of the first five-year plan for national economic construction, and beginning preparations for convening the National People's Congress. This marks that our country is advancing rapidly and the people are moving towards unlimited happiness.
    First of all, we should continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea for more than two years has already shattered the U.S. imperialist dream of enslaving China and dominating the world. However, the U.S. warmongers are not reconciled to admitting defeat and are unwilling to accept the readily available peace. The Eisenhower government is openly clamoring to expand the war, and has recently instructed the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to attempt to disrupt us. The U.S. imperialism gathered the armies of eighteen countries to carry out the war of aggression against Korea, spent more than 20 billion U.S. dollars in military expenses, and lost a total of 740,000 so-called "United Nations forces," only to end up in a disastrous defeat. Today, they want to make a comeback with the remaining Chiang bandits, is that possible? The Chiang bandits had millions of troops back then, and they have already been wiped out by the Chinese people. What use are these few remaining bandits today? Is this a trick of Eisenhower's conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians"? It can be said to be extremely boring. Despite this, Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai solemnly reminded the people of the whole country to be vigilant. We must firmly remember Vice Chairman Zhou's correct instruction: "The people of the whole country must be highly vigilant about this situation, on the one hand, we should continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and on the other hand, we should strengthen our national defense forces and be prepared to give the invading enemy a crushing blow at any time and any place." Vice Chairman Zhou's report solemnly declared our attitude: "The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war." If the Eisenhower government intends to peacefully end the Korean War, then resume the Panmunjom negotiations and immediately cease the war first. If the Eisenhower government still has no intention of resuming the Panmunjom negotiations and wants to continue and expand the Korean War, then Vice Chairman Zhou has also clearly told it: "The Korean and Chinese people will continue to fight in this regard, and they are fully prepared." This is a sentence representing the determination and strength of the Korean and Chinese people, and the U.S. warmongers should have heard it.
    In the process of continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the first five-year plan for national construction has begun. The struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea for more than two years has not hindered the work of social transformation and economic recovery in our country. On the contrary, the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has become the driving force for all transformation and progress in our country. Similarly, today, we are starting a large-scale national construction plan in the process of strengthening the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. These two things will complement each other. The Chinese people will strive to carry out national construction with the high spirit of patriotism and internationalism in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At the same time, they will inevitably use national construction to enrich their national defense forces and further strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to defeat any conspiracy and action of U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression.
    The reports of Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong both tell us that after the convening of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organizational form of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, should not only continue to exist but should also continue to be strengthened. I support the decision made at this meeting to convene the Second Plenary Session of the CPPCC National Committee, and to have the expanded Standing Committee do all the preparatory work. The Common Program needs to be appropriately revised, and the organizational law of the CPPCC also needs to be necessarily revised to meet the needs of the new situation after the convening of the National People's Congress and the formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese People's Democratic United Front under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party has enabled us to win the great victory of the people's revolution and created the conditions for large-scale national construction. In the future, it will enable our country to overcome all obstacles and difficulties, complete the construction of new democracy ahead of schedule, and steadily advance towards socialism.
    The people of the whole country unite more closely under the great banner of Chairman Mao!
    Smash all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression!
    Strive for the victorious completion of the three major national tasks of 1953!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great Chairman Mao!

Speech by Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee

    Chairman, Vice Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:
    I fully agree with the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the report by Deputy Head Guo Moruo on the World People's Peace Congress.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of Northeast China, starting from 1949, on the basis of the severe destruction of the Northeast economy, and under the heavy task of supporting the national liberation war and later supporting the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, simultaneously carried out the work of restoring and developing the national economy, and began large-scale economic construction with a focus on key areas last year.
    The total value of industrial production in Northeast China by the end of last year had exceeded the highest historical level by 23.2 percent. The proportion of industry in the entire national economy increased from 41.7 percent in 1949 to the current 56.2 percent. In the past three years, the total value of industrial production has increased more than threefold. The state-owned economy has established a solid leading position in the national economy.
    In 1952, on the basis of basically completing the tasks of national economic recovery and transformation, large-scale economic construction was started with a focus on key areas. The scale of capital construction last year was huge and technically complex. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and with the concerted efforts of the working class and the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, 92.1 percent of the total capital construction work for the year was completed, equivalent to 161 percent of the total capital construction in the three years from 1949 to 1951. The quality of the projects has also greatly improved compared to previous years. The capital construction work in the past year has proved that we are not only capable of carrying out economic recovery and transformation work, but also capable of carrying out technically extremely complex modern capital construction work.
    We still have many shortcomings in our capital construction work, which we must strive to overcome in the future. This year's capital construction tasks are even more arduous. We must improve the quality of the existing capital construction team politically, technically, and professionally, learn from advanced Soviet experience, promote advanced experience, strengthen financial management, and strengthen the organization and management of construction sites.
    In terms of industrial production: In addition to completing the national plan, we also completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy worth more than 11 million tons of grain.
    Agricultural production in Northeast China has not only fully recovered to pre-war levels in recent years, but has also made great progress. In 1952, we continued to implement the policy of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, improving agricultural technology, and increasing unit area yield. We educated farmers on the new and old roads and launched a mass patriotic bumper harvest movement, which led to further development in agricultural production. The total grain output reached 21 million tons, exceeding the highest pre-war output by 16.8 percent. In 1952, farmers in the whole region earned 4 million tons more grain than in 1951. About 80 percent of the farmers have been organized, and some experience has also been gained in the work of agricultural production cooperatives. After the mass bumper harvest movement, agricultural technology and farming methods have been greatly improved. In particular, the bumper harvest experience of large-scale improved farming methods in Zhaoyuan County has set a good example for our agricultural bumper harvest movement.
    Transportation and state-owned commerce and cooperatives have also developed greatly.
    The private industrial and commercial sectors have also developed considerably. Private industry increased by 23 percent in the first half of 1952 compared to the same period in 1951. Private commerce has also developed considerably in recent years, with the exception of certain speculative industries that are gradually being restructured.
    With the recovery and development of the economy, the average wage of all types of workers in the whole region increased by more than 61 percent in 1952 compared to 1949. Farmers' lives have also greatly improved. In the past three years, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has increased more than twofold. The safety and welfare work and sanitation equipment of factories and mines have also been greatly improved. The people's cultural undertakings have also achieved great development.
    People's representatives conferences at all levels in provinces, cities, and counties in Northeast China have been convened universally and have begun to become a regular system. All village people's governments are elected by the village people's congress. Among the 164 counties and banners in the whole region, 91 counties and banners have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress through people's representative conferences and elected the county and banner people's governments. Wherever the people's representative conferences or people's congresses are held well, the people's democratic life is very active, thereby promoting various tasks. The autonomous governments of ethnic minorities and the ethnic minority democratic united governments have been established successively, a large number of ethnic minority cadres have grown up, and the development of ethnic minority economies and cultures has further strengthened the unity of ethnic minorities in the Northeast region.
    From the perspective of the Northeast region, the conditions for convening the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all levels and implementing universal suffrage are fully available. The central government's decision to convene the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all levels and implement universal suffrage has been warmly supported by people of all classes and circles in Northeast China.
    Under the centralized leadership and unified planning of Chairman Mao and the central government, we must conscientiously complete all the tasks assigned to the Northeast region by the state. Northeast China is the front line of national defense. We must strive to do a good job in supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We must work hard to complete and exceed the state's plans and to do a good job in convening people's congresses at all levels in accordance with the national construction plan.
    In order to complete the above tasks, we must strengthen the inspection and supervision of our work, discover problems in a timely manner, solve problems, and correct certain bureaucratic and detached-from-the-masses styles that still exist in our work. We must work together with the people of the whole country to strive for a strong industrialized new China.

Speech by Liu Xia·Tudengtaba, Head of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation

    We fully agree with the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou, the report on the work of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Vice Chairman Chen, and the report on the process and achievements of the World People's Peace Congress by Deputy Head Guo. Vice Chairman Zhou's report has made us clearly understand the three most urgent and important tasks before us. The Tibetan people will resolutely fight together with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland to complete these great and urgent tasks.
    This time we have been visiting and studying in Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, East China, and Northwest China for nearly three months. We have personally seen how the construction of our great motherland has been advancing by leaps and bounds in the past three years; we have seen how the national defense forces of the motherland have been unprecedentedly consolidated and strengthened; we have seen how the people of all ethnic groups in the country are closely united under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We have seen how the monasteries of lamas in various places have been protected and guaranteed free development. We believe that our country will achieve greater victories in the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in 1953, and will definitely be able to smash any conspiracy of imperialism to expand the war. We believe that the national construction of the first five-year plan, which began in 1953, will definitely achieve brilliant achievements. We believe that the convening of the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all levels in 1953 in accordance with the resolution of the Central People's Government will further consolidate the people's democratic system and more fully unleash the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, so that our great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and planned national construction will be strongly guaranteed.
    The Tibetan people have long lived a dark life under the aggression of imperialism and the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary government. In May 1951, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, they were peacefully liberated and returned to the big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups, enjoying all rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, laying a bright and happy foundation for our Tibetan people. In the past year, under the close and united leadership of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and with the selfless, hardworking, and united assistance of the People's Liberation Army, not only has the national defense of our southwestern motherland been consolidated, but our Tibetan people have also begun to preliminarily carry out various construction works. In the future, we will resolutely work hard under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China to build a new Tibet. We will stand firmly with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland and will never allow the claws of imperialist aggression to extend into our sacred motherland's territory. Let us resolutely fight to victoriously complete the three most urgent and important tasks at present.
    Finally, we cheer:
    Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups!

Speech by Dong Biwu, Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC

    Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades attending!
    On January 13th of this year, the 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the resolution on convening the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels, and determined to convene the people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels this year through universal suffrage by the people, and then to convene the National People's Congress on this basis. At the same time, it was determined that the Constitution will be formulated, the outline of the national five-year construction plan will be approved, and a new Central People's Government will be elected at this National People's Congress. This is a historical and great event in the political life of the people of our country, and it is the inevitable development of our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to carry out the people's great revolution, overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and victoriously end the period of economic recovery and enter a period of large-scale construction. Such full exertion of the people's rights will more closely connect the People's Government with the people, further improve the revolutionary initiative and labor initiative of the people, make the construction of our new democratic regime more complete and more consolidated, and make the realization of our country's various construction plans more fully guaranteed.
    In the past three years, due to the initial establishment of the state, the wounds left by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries to the Chinese people urgently needed to be healed, and huge political movements and social reforms needed to be carried out, and the people had not been fully organized, therefore, the conditions for implementing the system of people's congresses were not yet available, and some transitional measures had to be adopted: in the central government, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, and in the local governments, the people's representative conferences of all circles exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses. At the same time, since the Constitution had not yet been formulated, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference temporarily replaced the role of the Constitution. Taking this transitional measure was completely correct and necessary in the past. But now, the transitional measure has completed its own historical mission and is no longer adapted to the needs of today's construction period. Now, military actions on the mainland have long ended, the revolutionary order has been stabilized; the national land reform has been basically completed; and people of all circles have been further organized on a national scale. Therefore, the conditions for implementing universal suffrage and convening the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels are already available. At the same time, it should also be particularly pointed out that after three years of land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and other democratic reforms and social reform movements, the political awareness of the people has been greatly improved; and after three years of education and training in the construction of the regime, the people have gained experience in conducting democratic elections. The representatives of the township people's representative conferences have been directly elected by the people in the vast majority, and have exercised the functions and powers of the township people's congress from the beginning; most of the representatives of the county (city) people's representative conferences are also elected by the people. More than one-third of the counties and administrative units equivalent to counties throughout the country have exercised the functions and powers of the county people's congress, and more than half in North China and Northeast China. More than two-thirds of the provinces and cities throughout the country have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress and elected the People's Government.
    In the past three years, the number of meetings held by people's representative conferences at all levels: generally eight or nine times in the county, and up to fifteen or sixteen times in many cases; generally eight or nine times in the city, and more than twenty times in many cases; and provinces also convened on schedule. Moreover, each time the people's representative conferences at all levels in various places were convened, the main content was to discuss and decide on the current central tasks, which were closely combined with production work, thus promoting the development of work and strengthening the construction of the people's democratic regime. This makes it possible for us to quickly transition from the people's representative conferences to implementing universal suffrage and convening the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. Therefore, the decision on this issue passed by the 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee is very timely and correct.
    Some people say: "The masses are not sufficiently conscious." This underestimates the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the long revolutionary struggle in the past, especially in the various revolutionary struggles and construction undertakings in the past three years. Some people say:
    "The masses are not cultured enough." It is true that there are still many illiterate working people, but as long as we adopt methods that the masses are familiar with and convenient for conducting elections, this difficulty can be overcome. Some people say: "Some people's representative conferences have not yet exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress, and the conditions are not sufficient." This is also an absolute view. Of course, if the people's representative conferences at all levels can universally exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress at an early date, it will be more conducive to the further democratization of the people's regime, but the people's representative conferences exercising the functions and powers of the people's congress is not a fixed step that cannot be crossed in the transition. As long as the conditions are available, it can be directly transitioned from the people's representative conferences (whether or not they exercise the functions and powers) to implementing universal suffrage and convening the people's congress. In addition, some people also talk about the principles of universality, equality, directness, and secrecy as soon as they talk about universal suffrage. In fact, the realization of the principles of universality, equality, directness, and secrecy has certain conditions. These principles have long been truly and fully implemented in the Soviet Union after the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution, and other new democratic countries have also gradually implemented them according to their own conditions. The Soviet Union is our example, and we, like other new democratic countries, are precisely going in this direction. But now our conditions cannot be fully met. Therefore, being impatient on the election issue is also not right. The people's representative conferences that we have already held, that is, the people's representative conferences that are not completely through elections, have proven to be incomparably superior to the deceptive parliamentary and electoral systems of European and American capitalist countries in more than three years of experience. The system of people's congress that we are about to implement with universal suffrage is precisely the most democratic system that is in line with China's current situation. The people of the whole country will joyfully welcome this election movement, so that the construction of our people's democratic regime will take another leap forward.
    The system of people's congress with universal suffrage is the basic system of our country formulated under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. Through its implementation, we can attract the people of the whole country to further manage the state power with the consciousness of being masters of their own affairs, thereby a hundredfold strengthening our state organs and more effectively guaranteeing the victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the completion of large-scale national construction plans. As for the People's Political Consultative Conference after the convening of the People's Congress, only its plenary session no longer exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress, it itself is still an organization of the united front of various democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, and patriotic democratic figures. It has positive significance in the political life of our country. The people need it, and it will continue to exist. On the occasion of the convening of the Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I wish the great cause of our country's democratization and industrialization victory, and long live the national system of the People's Congress!

Speech by Ma Yinchu, Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC

    Chairman, fellow committee members, gentlemen:
    Today's world situation is such that the strength of the imperialist camp has greatly shrunk, while the strength of the peace and democracy camp is growing stronger every day, and has already exceeded the strength of the imperialist camp. Based on this situation, I will report on some relations between the World People's Peace Congress and domestic politics, economy, and culture to illustrate our bright and splendid future and the possibility that we will move from a new democratic society to a socialist society.
    Mr. Guo Moruo has already given a detailed report on the situation of the World People's Peace Congress, so I will not repeat it. Now I will add a few words about what I heard and saw.
    I. Supplement to the First Point
    First of all, when the Soviet representative spoke at the conference, he explained that the Soviet people are committed to peaceful construction, which gave a very deep impression to the representatives of the conference. He said that U.S. imperialism says everywhere that the Soviet Union wants to invade it, and that China is invading Korea, so it is necessary to prepare for war, and also wants Britain, France, and other vassal states to prepare for war with it. The Soviet representative said that the purpose of this propaganda by U.S. imperialism is to cover up its own aggressive conspiracy. Because the Soviet army that entered various countries during the Second World War to pursue the enemy had already withdrawn after the war. What the Soviet Union teaches its young students is patriotism and internationalism, and propaganda for war is a crime in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country, and from 1917 to the present, it has translated 1,540 world-famous foreign books into the languages of sixty ethnic groups and published 227 million copies of these books translated into Russian. According to what our delegation saw during the visit, 500 buildings were built in Leningrad in 1952. The Stalin Street plan in Leningrad is 20 kilometers long, and 9 kilometers have already been completed, one-third of which has been extended in the past two years. There used to be only two schools in this place, but now there are 22 schools. There used to be only two doctors who made daily rounds, but now there are large hospitals. There used to be no parks, but now there are large parks. Now the streets are lined with tall buildings, all of which are beautiful workers' residences, and the construction of underground passages is starting throughout the city, with the same scale as the Moscow underground passages. The Soviet Union now has ten large research blood transfusion institutes nationwide, and blood transfusion stations have been established throughout the country, 150 large ones and 1,500 small ones. When human blood is not enough, they are researching the use of cow blood to replace human blood. Other health care undertakings, such as how to maintain the appropriate temperature and brightness indoors in factories and eliminate toxins in the air, are all done with all their might for the benefit of the people. The purpose of peaceful construction is to improve the people's material and cultural living standards, improve the people's health, and prolong the people's lives. Where is this preparing for war! The Soviet Union sees the people as so precious, would it be willing to launch a war and let the people sacrifice themselves for nothing? So the U.S. propaganda that the Soviet Union wants to invade it is completely nonsense and has no factual basis. The construction of Moscow University is also a good example. The new campus of Moscow University is planned to become the center of Greater Moscow. New buildings have now been built on the new campus. The main building is 36 stories high and 239.5 meters high, making it the tallest building in Europe. There are 66 elevators in the building, each of which can accommodate about 20 people, and it only takes 30 seconds to rise from the ground to the top floor. The total volume of stone, granite, and marble used in the main building is 1.35 million cubic meters. These stones are all transported from distant places such as the Ural Mountains, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. If these stones were used to build large buildings, it would be equivalent to 45 large buildings in Moscow City. The area of these stones is 260,000 square meters, which can be used to build five-story houses, connected to form 32 kilometers long. The main building has 20,000 rooms. There are more than 50 buildings in the entire school, including the main building, with a total of 46,000 rooms. The cumulative length of the stairs is 32 kilometers, and the cumulative length of the corridors is 74 kilometers. There are 1,693 laboratories of various sizes. There are 141 classrooms that can accommodate 600 people, and the classrooms are equipped with radios, sunlight lamps, and automatic ventilation equipment on all sides. There is a trade union club in the building, with an entertainment venue with 800 seats, with good equipment for performances and movie screenings, and a lecture hall with 1,500 seats. The broadcasting, ventilation, lighting, and other equipment are the same as in the large classrooms. Mass rallies are held in the square. The student dormitory is 18 stories high and can accommodate 6,000 to 7,000 students, including graduate students. Each person lives in a room with an area of 10 square meters. The room has a telephone, radio, and bathroom. If a child is born today and lives in each room of the 46,000 rooms for one day, it will take 126 years to live through all of them. We visited such a large-scale university, not only realizing the greatness of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction, but also realizing how much the Soviet Union is committed to improving the people's cultural level. Such great construction is only possible in a socialist country that seeks the welfare of the people, and is impossible in a capitalist country that seeks maximum profit. Therefore, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao want to lead China from new democracy to socialism.
    I think we should report the happy lives of the Soviet Union, which were obtained through arduous struggle and hard work, to young students. After listening to them, they will be very excited and willing to dedicate all their strength to learn their skills for the future of the motherland and the happiness of the people, and strive for the early arrival of a socialist society. I think that in twenty years, the scale of Peking University is likely to reach the extent of today's Moscow University. Since the liberation of Peking University three years ago, progress has been rapid in all aspects. Just look at the development of the budget! If the average number of November and December 1949 is taken as 100, the monthly average number has increased to 373 percent by 1951, and the monthly average number from January to August 1952 has increased to 930 percent. After the "Three-Anti" movement, it suddenly increased to 3322 percent, that is, it increased by more than 33 times compared with the average number in the last two months of 1949. On the one hand, this marks a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, and on the other hand, it also shows the People's Government's emphasis on education. Today, all the facilities of Peking University are modeled on Moscow University. We added 50,000 square meters of new classrooms and dormitories

    人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的发言
    一九五三年二月六日、七日
    政协全国委员会委员
    吴耀宗的发言主席、各位委员：
    我对周恩来副主席的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的会务报告以及郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告表示衷心拥护。全国宗教界人士必将为这几个报告所提出的任务的胜利完成而奋斗。
    经过三年多的努力，在毛主席的英明领导下，我们的国家，通过各种伟大的运动，已经基本地扫除了许多革命的障碍，进入大规模建设的时期，这是值得每一个中国人民庆幸的。现在我想把我们在一九五三年所要进行的三个伟大任务同整个世界和平问题联系起来，发表一点意见。
    在过去一年多当中，我曾经两次出席世界和平理事会，并参加了去年十月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，最近我又同基督教、天主教、佛教、伊斯兰教几位代表参加了中国代表团，出席了在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会。参加这些会议，对我是一个很好的教育，也是一个很大的启发。如果我能够用一句话来表达这些会议所给我的启发，这句话就是：战争是可以制止的；人民的觉悟，人民的意志，是决定一切的。
    在今天世界几个地区里——在朝鲜，在越南，在马来亚，帝国主义不是正在进行最野蛮的战争吗？战争贩子们不是整天叫嚣着，要把这些战争继续和扩大吗？除了这些战争以外，他们不是经常地制造国际紧张局势，经常地进行他们所谓的冷战吗？帝国主义这些疯狂的，灭绝人性的行动与计划是不是能够制止的呢？三年多以来的世界和平运动，给了我们一个愈来愈清楚的回答：能够的。为什么今天世界里还有许多爱好和平的人认为战争是不可能制止的呢？那就是因为他们只知道历史上的野心家们可以随便发动战争，他们不知道今天人民的力量可以制止战争；他们只知道原子弹，凝固汽油弹和细菌战的可怕，他们不知道人民的意志是一个更伟大的力量。他们不知道战争要靠人来进行，如果人民不要战争，战争就无法进行。
    在维也纳大会里，出席的代表们一致要求马上停止朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争；一致要求缔结五大国和平公约。他们的要求，也就是全世界绝大多数人民的要求。殖民地和半殖民地国家的代表们愤怒地控诉了帝国主义侵略者对他们的压迫与剥削。许多名义上是独立而实际上已经沦为美国殖民地的国家，像西欧和拉丁美洲各国，他们的人民也逐渐认识到美国侵略者所带给他们的灾难。这一切都证明了：和平阵营的力量，是愈来愈壮大了；只要人民觉悟了他们被欺骗，被出卖，他们就会联合起来，制止战争，保卫和平。斯大林主席的指示是完全正确的：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    中华人民共和国的诞生与发展是保卫世界和平的力量日渐壮大的一个最生动、最有力的例证。过去曾经有许多人把帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石匪帮对中国人民的反动统治看得非常可怕，但觉醒了的中国人民却把他们打垮了。在朝鲜战争的初期，也还有人要我们“洁身自好”，“少管闲事”，但两年多以来的事实却证明中朝人民的力量是一堵不可战胜的铜墙铁壁，这堵铜墙铁壁大大地打击了帝国主义的侵略野心，严重地阻遏了帝国主义的侵略计划。
    在我们一九五三年三个伟大任务中，继续加强抗美援朝不但保证了我们国家的安全，也保证了保卫世界和平力量的继续增涨；召开全国的和地方各级的人民代表大会将使已经觉醒了的中国人民更加爱护他们的祖国，更能发挥他们当家作主的力量；进行基本经济建设将使我们的国家不再是一个经济落后的国家，而是一个现代化的，能够为人民谋取最大福利的国家。把这些任务胜利地完成了就是把新中国放在磐石之上，使帝国主义的阴谋诡计都无法实现，使全世界的和平得到更有力的保障。这一切都完全证明了毛主席的英明指示：“美帝国主义是个纸老虎。”纸老虎是吓不倒人的；相反的，人民的觉悟，人民的意志，是决定一切的。
    值得我们庆幸的是：全国的宗教信徒，由于许多客观事实有力的启发，已经逐渐认识了祖国的伟大与可爱，认识了帝国主义穷凶极恶的面目和它对世界和平的威胁，认识了解放了的人民无穷无尽的智慧与力量。基督教和天主教的“三自”革新运动教育了广大的教徒群众，使他们开始从帝国主义的影响中被解放出来，热烈地参加了各种爱国运动。伊斯兰教和佛教最近也进行了以爱国爱教为宗旨的全国性组织。在宗教信仰自由的政策下，在人民政府积极的领导与协助下，这些宗教都向着新生的道路前进。帝国主义利用宗教在我国进行侵略的时代是过去了；中国的宗教不再是帝国主义的工具，而是
    一个保卫和平的力量。帝国主义关于新中国各个宗教情况的污蔑宣传，也将在铁一般的事实面前完全破产。为了这些值得欣慰的发展，我们不能不衷心地感激毛主席和中国共产党的领导。为了表示我们的感激，我们愿以最大的力量来参加新中国建设及保卫世界和平的一切工作。
    政协全国委员会委员
    王芸生的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了周恩来副主席的政治报告、陈叔通副主席的会务报告和郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的报告，使我们对祖国当前的三大任务有了明确的认识，对国家的伟大建设以及世界的和平事业更加强了胜利的信心。我谨在这里表示衷心感激和拥护。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第四次会议在这时候召开，向全国人民正式提出一九五三年国家三大任务：号召继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，宣告国家经济建设第一个五年计划开始，开始筹备召开全国人民代表大会，这就标志着我们国家是在飞跃地前进，人民走向无限的幸福。
    首先我们应该继续加强抗美援朝的斗争。两年多以来的抗美援朝斗争，业已粉碎了美帝国主义妄想奴役中国和独霸世界的迷梦。但是，美国战争贩子们还不甘心承认失败，还不肯接受触手可及的和平，艾森豪威尔政府正公开叫嚣扩大战争，最近更指使蒋介石残余匪帮企图对我进行扰乱的阴谋。美帝国主义纠集十八国军队进行侵朝战争，花费二百多亿美元的军费，损失所谓“联合国军”兵员七十四万之众，只落得惨败，今天想以残余蒋匪来翻本，行吗？蒋匪当年拥有数百万军队都已被中国人民所歼灭，今天只这一小撮残匪又中什么用？这就是艾森豪威尔“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋诡计的一种花样吗？可谓穷极无聊之至。尽管如此，我周恩来副主席还郑重唤起全国人民的警惕，我们必须紧紧记住周副主席的正确指示：“全国人民对这种情况必须高度警惕，一面应该继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，一面应该加强国防力量，准备随时随地对敢于来犯的敌人给以粉碎性的打击。”周副主席的报告，堂堂正正地宣布了我们的态度：“中国人民爱好和平，但是并不惧怕战争。”艾森豪威尔政府如果有意和平结束朝鲜战争，那么就恢复板门店谈判，立即先行停战。艾森豪威尔政府如果仍无意恢复板门店谈判，而要继续和扩大朝鲜战争，那么，我周副主席也已经明明白白地告诉它：“朝中人民在这方面也将继续斗争下去，并且是有了充分准备的。”这是代表中朝人民的决心和力量的一句话，美国战争贩子们应该已经听到了。
    在继续加强抗美援朝斗争中，第一个五年的国家建设计划开始了。过去两年多以来的抗美援朝斗争，并未曾妨碍我国社会改造和经济恢复的工作，相反地，抗美援朝斗争却成为我们国家一切改造进步的推动力。同样的，今天我们在加强抗美援朝斗争中开始大规模的国家建设计划，这两件事是会相辅而行的。中国人民将以抗美援朝斗争的高度爱国主义和国际主义的精神努力进行国家大建设，同时也必然以国家大建设来充实国防力量，更加强抗美援朝的斗争，以击溃美帝国主义的任何扩大侵略的阴谋和行动。
    周恩来副主席和陈叔通副主席的报告，都告诉我们：在全国人民代表大会召开之后，作为中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式的中国人民政协，不仅应该继续存在，而且应该继续加强。我拥护此次会议作出召开第二届人民政协全体会议的决定，并由扩大后的常务委员会做好一切准备工作。共同纲领需作适当的修改，人民政协的组织法也需作必要的修改，以符合召开全国人民代表大会并制定中华人民共和国宪法之后新情况的需要。在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下的中国人民民主统一战线，已使我们获得人民革命的伟大胜利，创造了国家大规模建设的条件，今后更将使我们国家战胜一切障碍和困难，提前完成新民主主义的建设，稳步地向着社会主义前进。
    全中国人民一致在毛主席的伟大旗帜下更紧密地团结起来！
    粉碎美帝国主义一切扩大侵略的阴谋！
    争取一九五三年国家三大任务的胜利完成！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！
    东北行政委员会副主席
    高崇民的发言主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意周恩来副主席的政治报告、陈叔通副主席的会务报告、郭沫若副团长的关于世界人民和平大会的报告。
    东北人民在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，从
    一九四九年起，在东北经济遭受了严重破坏的基础上，在支援全国解放战争以及以后支援抗美援朝战争的繁重任务下，同时进行了恢复和发展国民经济的工作，并从去年有重点地开始了大规模经济建设。
    东北工业生产总值到去年年底已经超过历史上最高水平百分之二十三点二。工业在整个国民经济中所占的比重，由一九四九年的百分之四十一点七提高到现在的百分之五十六点二。在最近三年中，工业生产总值增长了两倍以上。国营经济在国民经济中树立了巩固的领导地位。
    一九五二年在基本上完成了国民经济恢复和改造任务的基础上，有重点地开始了大规模经济建设。去年基本建设的规模是巨大的，技术上是复杂的，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下、在工人阶级的一致努力和苏联专家的热诚帮助下，完成了全年基本建设工作总量的百分之九十二点一，等于一九四九年到一九五一年三年基本建设总量的百分之一百六十一。工程质量也比往年有很大进步。一年来的基本建设工作，证明了我们不仅能够进行经济的恢复和改造工作，而且能够进行技术上极其复杂的近代化的基本建设工作。
    我们在基本建设工作中还有很多缺点，今后要努力克服。今年的基本建设任务更加繁重，要从政治上、技术上、业务上提高现有基本建设队伍的质量，学习苏联先进经验，推广先进经验，加强财务管理，加强工地的组织管理工作。
    在工业生产方面：我们除完成了国家计划之外，并完成了增产节约价值一千一百多万吨粮食的任务。
    东北农业生产，几年来不仅完全恢复了战前水平，并且有了很大的发展。一九五二年继续贯彻了发展互助合作运动、提高农业技术和提高单位面积产量的方针，对农民进行了新旧道路的教育，开展了群众性的爱国丰产运动，农业生产有了进一步的发展。粮食总产量达到二千一百万吨，超过战前最高产量百分之十六点八，一九五二年全区农民比一九五一年多收入四百万吨粮食。组织起来的农民已达百分之八十左右，农业生产合作社的工作，也取得了一些经验。经过了群众性的丰产运动，农业技术与耕作方法有了不少的改进，特别是肇源县大面积改良耕作方法的丰产经验，为我们农业丰产运动树立了一个很好的榜样。
    交通运输和国营商业与合作社也有很大发展。
    私营工商业也有相当发展。私人工业，一九五二年上半年比一九五一年同期增加了百分之二十三。私人商业除某些投机性行业逐渐转业改组外，几年来也有相当发展。
    随着经济的恢复与发展，全区各类职工平均工资一九五二年比一九四九年增加了百分之六十一强。农民生活也有很大改善。三年来，城乡人民购买力提高了两倍多。工厂矿山企业的安全福利工作和卫生设备，也有很大改善。人民的文化事业也有了极大的发展。
    东北各省、市、县均已普遍召开过各界人民代表会议，并开始成为经常制度，所有村人民政府均由村人民代表大会选举产生。全区一百六十四个县、旗，已有九十一个县、旗由人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权，选举了县、旗人民政府。凡各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会开得好的地方，人民的民主生活就很活跃，因而推动了各项工作。少数民族地区民族自治区政府和民族民主联合政府相继成立，少数民族干部大量成长起来，少数民族经济和文化的发展，进一步加强了东北区各少数民族的团结。
    从东北地区看，召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会实行普选的条件，是完全具备了的。中央决定召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会，实行普选，获得了东北各阶层和各界人民的热烈拥护。
    在毛主席和中央集中领导和统一计划之下，我们一定要兢兢业业地完成国家在东北地区的各项任务。东北是国防前线，我们要努力做好支援中国人民志愿军，加强抗美援朝的工作，要按照国家建设计划，为完成并超过国家的计划，并做好召开各级人民代表大会的工作而努力。
    为了完成上述任务，我们必须加强工作的检查和监督，及时地发现问题，解决问题，纠正工作中还存在的某些官僚主义，脱离群众的作风。我们要和全国人民一道为强大的工业化的新中国而奋斗。
    西藏致敬团团长
    柳霞·土登塔巴的发言
    我们完全同意周副主席的政治报告、陈副主席的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于会务的报告、郭副团长关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告。周副主席的报告使我们明确认识了摆在我们面前最迫切最重大的三大任务，我们西藏人民将和祖国各民族人民一起坚决为完成这些伟大的迫切的任务而奋斗。
    我们这一次在内蒙、东北、华东、西北参观学习将近三个月，我们亲眼看到了我们伟大祖国的建设事业三年来怎样在突飞猛进；我们看到了祖国国防力量怎样空前地巩固和壮大；我们看到了全国各民族人民在毛主席领导下怎样紧密的团结。我们看到了各地喇嘛寺庙怎样得到了保护和自由发展的保障。我们相信：我们的国家在一九五三年抗美援朝的伟大斗争中，一定会获得更大的胜利，一定能粉碎帝国主义任何扩大战争的阴谋。我们相信：一九五三年开始的第一个五年计划的国家建设，一定能获得辉煌的成就。我们相信：根据中央人民政府决议在一九五三年召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会，必会更进一步地巩固人民民主制度，更充分地发挥全国人民的积极性，从而使我们抗美援朝的伟大斗争和有计划的国家建设获得强有力的保证。
    我们西藏人民长期在帝国主义的侵略和国民党反动政府压迫剥削之下，过着暗无天日的生活，一九五一年五月，在各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席领导之下，获得了和平解放，回到了各民族友爱合作的大家庭里来了，享受到民族平等和宗教信仰自由的各项权利，给我们藏族人民奠定了光明幸福的基础。这一年来在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密团结的领导下，在人民解放军不辞辛苦、勤劳努力的团结帮助下，不仅我们祖国西南的国防得到了巩固，我们西藏人民也已经在开始初步地进行各项建设工作。今后我们坚决在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下为建设新西藏而努力。我们将要和祖国各民族人民紧紧地站在一起，决不让帝国主义侵略的魔爪伸进我们神圣的祖国国土里来。让我们坚决为胜利地完成当前最迫切最重大的三大任务而奋斗。
    最后我们欢呼：
    各民族人民大团结万岁！
    各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    政协全国委员会委员
    董必武的发言主席、各位委员、各位列席的同志！
    今年一月十三日，中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议通过了关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议，确定了在今年召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在这个基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会。同时确定了在这次全国人民代表大会上将制定宪法，批准国家五年建设计划纲要和选举新的中央人民政府。这是我国人民政治生活中一个历史性的巨大事件，是我国在中国共产党的领导之下进行人民大革命，推翻帝国主义和国民党反动统治，并胜利地结束了经济恢复时期而进入了大规模建设时期必然的发展。这样人民权利的充分发挥，将更密切人民政府和人民群众之间的联系，更提高人民群众的革命积极性和劳动积极性，使我们新民主主义政权建设更加完备，更加巩固，使我们国家的各项建设计划的实现也就更加有了充分的保障。
    过去三年多的时间中，由于国家初建，帝国主义和国民党反动派所遗留给中国人民的创伤急待恢复，巨大的政治运动和社会改革有待进行，人民群众还没有充分组织起来，因此，实行人民代表大会制度的条件还不具备，不得不采用一些过渡办法：在中央由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权，在地方由各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权。同时，由于还没有制定宪法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领暂时代替了宪法的作用。采取这种过渡办法，在过去完全是正确的、必要的。但在现在，过渡办法已完成了它自身的历史使命，已经不适应今天建设时期的需要了。在现在大陆上的军事行动早经结束，革命秩序已经稳定；全国土地改革已经基本完成；各界人民已经在全国规模上进一步地组织起来了。因此，实行普选，召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的条件已经具备。同时还应特别指出：全国人民三年来经过土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、三反、五反以及其它各项民主改革和社会改革运动，政治觉悟已有了极大的提高；而且经过三年来政权建设的教育和锻炼，人民群众已经有了进行民主选举的经验。各地乡人民代表会议的代表绝大多数已是由人民直接选举的，并且一开始就执行了乡人民代表大会的职权；县（市）人民代表会议的多数代表也是由人民选举的。全国各县及相当于县的行政单位已有三分之一以上代行县人民代表大会职权，华北和东北则已超过半数。全国各省市已有三分之二以上代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了人民政府。
     三年来，各级人民代表会议开会次数：县一般为八、九次，多者达十五、六次；市一般为八、九次，多者达二十余次；省亦均按期召开。而且各地各级每次召开人民代表会议，均以讨论与决定当前中心任务为主要内容，紧密地与生产工作相结合，因此，推动了工作的发展，也加强了人民民主政权的建设。这就使我们有可能很快地由人民代表会议过渡到实行普选、召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会。因此，中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议通过的关于这一问题的决定，是非常适时的、正确的。
    有人说：“群众觉悟还不够”。这是低估了中国人民在过去长期革命斗争中特别在三年来各种革命斗争与建设事业上所达到的伟大成就。有人说：
    “群众文化不够”。诚然，劳动人民不识字者尚多，但只要我们采用群众所熟悉的和便利的方式去进行选举，这个困难是能够克服的。有人说：“人民代表会议还有些未代行人民代表大会的职权，条件不够”。这也是绝对化的看法。固然，各级人民代表会议如能普遍地早日代行人民代表大会的职权，会更有利于人民政权的进一步民主化，但人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权，并非过渡中不可逾越的固定步骤。只要条件具备，自可由人民代表会议（无论代行与否）直接过渡为实行普选、召开人民代表大会。此外，也有些人一谈到普选，就把普遍、平等、直接、秘密等原则相提并论。实际普遍、平等、直接、秘密等原则的实现，都有一定的条件。这些原则，在苏联是在斯大林宪法公布后早已真正的完全实行了，其他新民主主义国家根据他们自身的条件，也都逐渐实行起来。苏联是我们的榜样，我们和其他新民主主义国家一样，也正是走的这个方向。但现在我们的条件，还不可能完全做到。因此，在选举问题上心急也是不对的。我们已行过的人民代表会议，即不完全是经过选举的人民代表会议，人民在三年多的经验中已证明比欧美资本主义国家骗人的代议制和选举制优越得不可比拟。我们即将要实行的普选的人民代表大会制度，正是符合中国目前情况最民主的制度。全国人民将会欢欣鼓舞地来迎接这一个选举运动，使我们人民民主政权建设更向前跃进一步。
    普选的人民代表大会制度，是在毛泽东同志领导下所制定的我们国家的基本制度。通过它的实行，就可以吸引全国人民进一步以主人翁的自觉来管理国家政权，从而百倍地加强我们的国家机关，更加有力地保障抗美援朝斗争的胜利，完成大规模的国家建设计划。至于人民代表大会召开以后，人民政协，只是它的全体会议不再执行人民代表大会的职权，它本身仍然是各民主党派、各民众团体、各民族、国外华侨和爱国民主人士的统一战线的组织，它在我国政治生活中是有积极意义的。人民需要它，它会存在下去。值此中国人民政治协商会议第四次全国委员会议召开之时，我预祝我们国家民主化与工业化的伟大事业获得胜利，人民代表大会的国家制度万岁！
    政协全国委员会委员
    马寅初的发言主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    今天世界的形势，帝国主义阵营的力量大大的缩小了，和平民主阵营的力量则天天在壮大，并且已经超过帝国主义阵营的力量了。我根据这一种形势报告一些世界人民和平大会和国内政治经济文化的关系，来说明我们光辉灿烂的前途，说明我们将由新民主主义社会向社会主义社会迈进的可能性。
    世界人民和平大会的情况，郭沫若先生已经作了详细报告，我不再重复。我现在就我所听到和见到的补充说几句。
    一、补充第一点
    首先苏联代表在大会中发言时，说明苏联人民致力于和平的建设，给予大会代表的印象是非常深刻的。他说美帝国主义处处说苏联想侵略它，说中国侵略朝鲜，所以必要备战，并且还要英国、法国及其他仆从国家一起跟它备战。苏联代表说美帝国主义这种宣传，目的在掩蔽它自己的侵略阴谋。因为苏联在二次世界大战期间，因追击敌人而进入各国的军队，战后期间早已撤回。苏联教育青年学生的是爱国主义与国际主义，宣传战争在苏联是有罪的。苏联是多民族的国家，从一九一七年起到现在为止，它已用六十种民族的语言翻译了一五四○种世界知名的外文书籍，并出版了二亿二千七百万册这种译成俄文的书籍。据我们代表团参观所见到的，一九五二年在列宁格勒建造五○○所大厦，列宁格勒有斯大林街计划长达二十公里，已成者九公里，其中三分之
    一是最近两年来延长出去的。这地方从前只有两个学校，现在已经有二十二个学校，从前只有两个每天巡回看望的医生，现在有大的医院，从前没有公园，现在有大的公园。现在这条街的两边大厦林立，都是很美丽的工人住宅，并且在全城开始建造地下道，与莫斯科地下道的规模一样。苏联现在全国设有大的研究输血学院十所，全国各地设立输血站，大的一百五十所，小的一千五百所，人血不够供应时，研究用牛血来代替人血。其他保健事业，如：如何维持工厂室内的适当温度与光亮，消除空气中的毒素等，没有一样不用全力为人民的利益着想。和平建设的目的在提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，增进人民的健康，延长人民的寿命，那里为准备打仗呢！苏联对于人民看得这样宝贵，肯去发动战争，让人民白白的牺牲吗？所以美国的宣传苏联要侵略它，完全胡说八道，毫无事实根据。莫斯科大学的建设，也是一个很好的例证。莫斯科大学新的校址是计划成为大莫斯科的中心。现在新校址上已建造起新的大厦，大厦正楼高三十六层，高度为二百三十九公尺半，是欧洲最高的大厦。大厦中有六十六架升降机，每架约可容二十人，每次只需三十秒钟即能从地面升到顶层。大厦正楼所用的石料、花岗石与大理石总的体积有一三五万立方公尺，这些石料都是从乌拉尔山高加索和乌克兰等远处运来，这些石料若用来建筑大楼可等于莫斯科城内大楼四十五所。这些石料的面积有二十六万平方公尺，可以用来建筑五层楼房子，接连成三十二公里长。大厦正楼共有房子两万间。全校房屋有五十多所，包括大厦正楼在内，共有房间四六○○○间。楼梯累计长达三十二公里，走廊长累计达七十四公里，有大小试验室一六九三所。可以容纳六○○人的教室有一四一个，教室中四面装有播音机，太阳光灯，自动通风设备。大厦内有工会俱乐部，有容纳八○○人座位的娱乐场，设备很好，可供演戏和放映电影之用，还有容纳一千五百人的演讲厅，播音、通风、灯光等设备与大教室一样，全体群众大会则在广场中举行。学生宿舍高十八层，可容纳学生六○○○到七○○○人，研究生亦在内，每人住一间，每一间面积合十平方公尺，房内有电话、播音机、洗澡间。倘今天生一个孩子，在四六○○○间内每房间住一天，要一二六年才能住遍。我们参观了这样大规模的大学，不仅体会到苏联和平建设的伟大，同时更体会到苏联如何地致力于人民文化水准的提高。这样伟大的建设，只有为人民谋福利的社会主义国家才有可能，为获取最大限度利润的资本主义国家是不可能有的。所以共产党和毛主席要领导中国从新民主主义走向社会主义。
    我以为我们应该把苏联这种经过艰苦斗争和辛勤劳动所获得的幸福生活的情况向青年学生报告，他们听了，一定非常兴奋，一定愿意献出自己一切的力量，学好本领为祖国前途、为人民幸福，争取社会主义社会的早日到来。我想二十年之后，北京大学的规模很可能达到今天莫斯科大学的程度。北京大学解放三年以来，各方面的进步都是很快的。试看预算的发展吧！若把一九四九年十一月和十二月的平均数作为一○○，到一九五一年，每月平均数已增到百分之三七三，一九五二年一月至八月的八个月，每月平均数增到百分之九三○，“三反”运动后突增到百分之三三二二，即比一九四九年最后两个月的平均数增加到三十三倍以上。这是一面标志着国家财政经济情况的根本好转，一面也表示着人民政府对教育的重视。今天北京大学的一切设施都是
    以莫斯科大学为模范的，我们一九五二年添建了新教室与宿舍五万平方公尺，一九五三年更计划建筑
    一万平方公尺，以适应发展的需要。我们的学生，一九五二年自三千多名突增至五千名，工农子女的成份大大提高，图书自一二○万册增加到一八○万册。去年院系调整后，关于专业的设置，教学计划和教学大纲的制订，及课程的安排，教研组的组织等，都是与国家建设的需要相配合的，从本质上改变了它原来的面貌。
    社会主义的目的在提高人民的经济生活水准和文化生活水准，莫斯科大学标志着苏联文化的高潮，二十年后的中国财经情况一定可以负担得起像莫斯科大学这样的伟大建筑来标志着中国文化建设的高潮，这是我要补充的第一点。
    二、补充第二点
    关于中国代表的发言我也要补充几句。首先中国代表团宋团长就当前问题对大家说清道理，她说：“许多被战争制造者控制了它的经济的地方，那里的人民对于捐税的增加，食物的减少，学校、医院与房屋的缺少，正在发出抗议，表示不满。”而“战争制造者则为一小撮拥有垄断企业从大规模毁灭中获取暴利”。这些话的内容是资本主义国家的代表所亲身体验到的。宋团长并说明今天世界和平运动力量已经非常强大，我们必须选择和平道路，准备行动来保卫和平，所以说“人民能够扭转局势”。她的发言对世界人民，尤其对美国的人民是很能起鼓舞作用的。
    这次召开世界人民和平大会的目的，是把和平运动在各国展开，把世界上所有爱好和平的人民团结起来，把战争贩子们孤立起来，防止战争，保卫和平。根据这个大原则，居里先生提出了三个中心问题：（一）民族独立与国际安全；（二）停止现行战争，尤其是朝鲜战争，以协商代替武力；（三）和缓国际紧张局势。大会上有七十四个国家的一百八十八位代表围绕着这三个中心问题发言，结果对于两大文件取得了一致的意见。
    世界人民和平大会中所讨论的三个中心问题，是与我们现在展开全国规模的政治学习有密切关联的。我们学习了马林科夫报告中的第二节，我们大家都认识到苏联争取和平的努力。他说“一切国家的人民都深切地认识到有必要对新战争威胁进行斗争，美国的广大群众也是如此，因为一旦战争爆发，他们遭受的灾难不会比其他国家的人民少些。”，“目前的任务就是更加提高人民群众的积极性，加强和平保卫者的组织，不倦地揭露战争挑拨者的真面目，不让他们用谎言迷乱人民的视听，制止和孤立那些一味为了追求利润而不惜使人民遭受血腥的屠杀的帝国主义侵略者阵营中的冒险分子——这就是一切进步的爱好和平的人类的主要任务。”
    全国规模的政治学习包括了斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”，许多国内的知识分子认为资本主义和社会主义间矛盾比资本主义国家间的矛盾更为剧烈。斯大林说：“从理论上讲来，这当然是对的。这不仅在现时、在目前是对的，就在第二次世界大战以前也是对的。这是资本主义国家领导者们也多少懂得的。然而，第二次世界大战终究不是从对苏联作战开始，而是从资本主义国家间的战争开始的。”他又说：“当时资本主义国家间争夺市场的斗争以及它们想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望，在实践上是比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈”。“现今的和平运动，其目的是唤起人民群众去为维护和平、防止新的世界大战而斗争”。
    “最可能的，当前的和平运动、即维护和平的运动在获得胜利时，就会使新的战争得以防止。”“但是，这仍然不足以根本消灭资本主义国家间战争的不可避免性。其所以不足，是因为纵然有保卫和平运动的这一切胜利，但帝国主义仍然保持，仍然存在，因而战争之不可避免性也仍然是存在的。”
    周恩来副主席的政治报告，也对国际形势作了明确的分析，并给我们指出了奋斗的方向。
    我们的政治学习，如能把世界人民和平大会的文件、联共第十九次代表大会上马林科夫的报告、斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和周恩来副主席的政治报告结合起来学习，意义更加深刻，内容更加丰富。这是我要补充的第二点。
    三、我们的责任
    我们今年就要进行各级人民代表大会的选举了，人民代表大会制度所能起的作用，诚如人民日报一月十五日的社论所说：“实行普选的人民代表大会制度，就是使人民可以充分地自由地按照自己的意志把自己认为是最好的和必要的人选到自己的国家政权机关和地方政权机关中去，同时使这些政权机关中自己所不满的人不再当选。这就是使人民进一步成为国家政权机关和地方政权机关的主人翁，使人民更容易有能力有便利扫除一切妨碍人民成为主人翁的障碍物。因此，这就是大大提高人民的革命积极性，这就是大大加强人民民主专政的力量，这就是大大加强经济建设的力量，这就是大大加强抗美援朝的力量。”我们大家都知道加强抗美援朝就是加强保卫世界和平的力量，进一步保障人民的幸福生活，因为美帝国主义是今天世界侵略战争阵营的头子，是我们最狡猾最凶恶的敌人。它凭借它的武力到处奴役和掠夺广大劳动人民，若我们不给以坚强的打击，它就会更加猖狂。两年多来，它无时不阴谋扩大侵略朝鲜的战争而终于一再遭受惨败，就是因为我们的抗美援朝的斗争。我们展开全国规模的轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动在保卫世界和平与祖国安全方面，已经有了很大的贡献。今年将实行普选的人民代表大会制度，使新民主主义政权建设前进一大步，加强抗美援朝的力量，加速经济建设的进程，使世界和平运动获得进一步的发展，使祖国人民的和平幸福的生活有了进一步的保障。这是中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民革命进一步的胜利。做好普选人民代表的准备工作，是我们当前每一个人的光荣任务。祝我们工作顺利。
    政协全国委员会委员
    梁希的发言主席、各位委员：
    在这次大会上周副主席，郭副主席和陈副主席的三个报告，我完全拥护。
    三年来，中国自然科学工作者在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，经过了伟大的抗美援朝运动，土地改革运动，镇压反革命运动，“三反”“五反”和思想改造运动。这些运动，是史无前例的，因此，全国理、工、农、医各方面科学工作者都受到了很大的教育，发生了思想和行动上的大转变。
    在科学岗位上：一方面，自然科学工作者依照着人民政协共同纲领中科学服务于工业、农业的方针，改变过去作风，不单从个人兴趣出发，务须把科学工作配合国家生产建设，适应人民实际需要。举例如：石炭汽车，球墨铸铁，特种合金（如钼铁、钨铁），永久磁铁，植物性杀虫药，合成杀虫药，耐火材料，人造橡胶，植物生长素等等研究工作，都得到了相当的成绩。尤其值得指出的，新时代的科学工作者与旧时代绝然不同，已经能够自动地组织起来，根据国家和人民需要，深入到现场中去做集体工作：一九五一年淮河水利工程，就有三千多人参加工作，一九五二年华南垦植事业，又有一千多人参加勘测。学院式的生活，将成为过去的陈迹了。这，在反动政府时代是不可能做到的。
    另一方面，共同纲领给科学界规定了一项重要任务：“普及科学知识”。科学工作者就在一九五○年八月，接受了这个光荣的任务，成立了中华全国科学技术普及协会，要把科学技术普遍地带到工、农群众中去。全国大多数科学家、技术专家、教师、医务工作者、工程师、农林水利学家，都自愿地参加到协会的队伍中来，担负起这个工作。两年多以来，在组织方面，发展到二十五个分会，三十五个支会，三百六十个工作组，会员共一万七千人。在业务方面，规定着四项宣传工作：宣传卫生知识；普及生产知识；用科学的方法破除迷信；宣传新中国科学建设的成就以发扬爱国主义。总共讲演一万五千余次，展览四百十五次，受益人数约一千一百万人，发行宣传小册一百二十多种，四十多万册。科学工作者结合群众，群众亦需要科学工作者，单是去年中苏友好月中宣传苏联先进经验和社会主义建设成就，全国就讲演了三千三百多次，放映幻灯一百六十多次，展览十七次，听众和观众达到一百六十万人。这更是反动政府时代所不可能做到的。
    当然，这些工作，还远远跟不上时代的要求，还须我们继续努力。
    在政治运动上：中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会（科联）和中华全国科学技术普及协会（科普），响应了人民政协全国委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，帮助动员科学工作者参加伟大的抗美援朝运动。两年来，人民志愿医疗队，人民志愿救护队，一大批一大批地开赴朝鲜。而“科联”和“科普”会员又两次参加了赴朝慰问团，慰问英勇和胜利作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。只要朝鲜战争一天不停，就一天不会缺少中国科学工作者在朝鲜前方和后方，和朝鲜人民并肩斗争。
    美帝发动细菌战以后，更有许多中国昆虫学家、细菌学家、生物学家、药学家、医学家和农学家在全国委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会号召之下，组织起来，随同其他团体到东北和朝鲜参加反细菌战。接着，就在国内普遍地展开了爱国卫生的宣传运动，去年四、五、六三个月，全国科学工作者的卫生讲演，举行了五千九百多次，吸引了听众三百四十四万多人。科学工作者们从这里体会到：只有在人民政权之下，才有可能发挥爱国主义，尽其应尽的责任。
    毛主席指示：“为着建立新民主主义的独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的中国，需要大批的人民的教育家，教师，人民的科学家，工程师，技师，医生，新闻工作者，著作家，文学家，艺术家与普通文化工作者，以‘为人民服务’‘和人民打成一片’的精神，从事艰巨的工作”。
    现在，全国人民正面临着：继续抗美援朝，开始五年国家建设计划和召开全国人民代表大会。及各级人民代表大会三个伟大任务。我们科学工作者愿提出保证：在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，一定要以“为人民服务”，“和人民打成一片”的精神，更进一步地改造思想，努力做好理、工、农、医各个岗位上的艰巨工作，完成新民主主义建设，向伟大的光明的社会主义道路前进。
