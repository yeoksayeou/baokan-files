Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 27th: Party and government leading organs in the Central and Southern region attach great importance to the "Supplementary Instructions on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Month" issued by the CCP Central Committee, and are now deploying and inspecting work in accordance with the spirit of these instructions. The CCP Central Committee's Central and Southern Bureau has issued supplementary instructions on the Marriage Law implementation movement in the Central and Southern region, based on the CCP Central Committee's supplementary instructions and in light of the specific circumstances of the Central and Southern region. After receiving the CCP Central Committee's supplementary instructions, the relevant responsible persons of the Central and Southern Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee immediately held a meeting to further study the requirements and methods of the Marriage Law implementation movement in the Central and Southern region, and decided that the Marriage Law implementation movement must strictly prohibit the random raising of slogans and the use of struggle methods. In order to enable the cadres who are being centrally trained in various counties to quickly carry out their work in accordance with the CCP Central Committee's supplementary instructions, the Central and Southern People's Broadcasting Station broadcast this instruction continuously on the 20th and 21st. The Central and Southern Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee contacted various provinces and some counties by telephone to understand the listening situation, and stipulated that after the Central and Southern Marriage Law Implementation Inspection Groups arrived in various counties, they should first convey the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's supplementary instructions. A total of forty members of the Central and Southern Marriage Law Implementation Inspection Group departed for the six provinces and two cities under the Central and Southern region on the 23rd and 24th, and will select key areas to conduct in-depth inspections of special districts, counties, and even districts and townships. Their work tasks are: to understand the situation of the Marriage Law implementation movement, absorb experience, discover and reflect problems, and assist various localities in implementing the instructions of the Central Committee and the Central and Southern region on the Marriage Law implementation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 27th: In order to correct cadres' policy thinking on the Marriage Law implementation movement and ensure the smooth and healthy development of the movement, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference of party member cadres in early February. More than 400 people attended the meeting, including members of party committees at all levels above the county level and secretaries of the women's work committees of party committees. The meeting summarized the experiences of key pilot work in implementing the Marriage Law in more than 100 villages, streets, and factories and mines throughout the province, and determined the principles, steps, and methods for carrying out the Marriage Law implementation movement throughout the province.

The conference focused on solving two key issues in carrying out the movement: The first was to unify the policy thinking of cadres. Most of the cadres attending the meeting had impatient sentiments. They did not have a deep understanding of the principle of adhering to education in the Marriage Law implementation movement, and they believed that this would "not make the movement thorough." They advocated "combining punishment with education"; advocated solving all problems in this movement. Some people even advocated that all buying and selling of marriages should be registered, and betrothal gifts should be confiscated, and divorce should be decided; and that all early marriages should be annulled. The meeting sharply criticized these erroneous ideas, pointing out that if these ideas are not corrected in time, they will cause some social chaos, deepen contradictions within the people, expand family disputes, and hinder production. The meeting also criticized the negative sentiments of some cadres who excessively emphasized the contradictions and difficulties between the Marriage Law implementation movement and various tasks, and therefore did not pay attention to the movement. The meeting pointed out that if this kind of thinking and emotion is not corrected in time, it will also affect the development of the movement, and the work of implementing the Marriage Law will not achieve practical results.

In addition, some facts revealed at the meeting show that feudal ideas such as patriarchal dominance and preference for sons over daughters still universally exist to varying degrees among cadres at all levels; and illegal and undisciplined behaviors such as interfering with freedom of marriage and abusing women are not isolated cases. Therefore, the meeting emphasized: In the Marriage Law implementation movement, it must be combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Only by first eradicating the feudal ideas of cadres and severely handling violations of law and discipline can the Marriage Law implementation movement be effectively carried out.

    认真执行中共中央贯彻婚姻法的补充指示
    中南区党政领导机关布置和检查工作
    河北省召开党员干部大会端正政策思想
    【新华社武汉二十七日电】中南区党政领导机关对中共中央发布的“关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示”极为重视，现正根据这指示的精神布置和检查工作。中共中央中南局已根据中共中央的补充指示并结合中南区的具体情况，发出了中南区贯彻婚姻法运动的补充指示。中南贯彻婚姻法运动委员会有关负责人在接到中共中央的补充指示后，立即举行会议，进一步研究了中南区贯彻婚姻法运动的要求和作法，决定在贯彻婚姻法运动中，必须严格禁止乱提口号和采用斗争的方法。为了使各县正在集中训练的干部迅速根据中共中央的补充指示进行工作，中南人民广播电台在二十、二十一两日，连续广播了此项指示，中南贯彻婚姻法运动委员会曾用电话和各省及部分县联系，了解收听情况，并规定中南贯彻婚姻法视察组到达各县后，首先要传达中共中央补充指示的精神。中南贯彻婚姻法视察组共四十人，已在二十三、二十四两日分赴中南所属六省二市，将选定重点，深入专区、县以至区、乡视察。他们的工作任务是：了解贯彻婚姻法运动的情况，吸取经验，发现并反映问题，协助各地贯彻执行中央及中南关于贯彻婚姻法运动的指示。
    【新华社保定二十七日电】为了端正干部对贯彻婚姻法运动的政策思想，保证运动顺利地健康地开展，中共河北省委员会在二月上旬召开党员干部大会。到会有全省县以上各级党委委员、党委妇女工作委员会书记等四百多人。会议总结了全省一百多个村庄、街道和工厂、矿山贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作的经验，确定了在全省开展贯彻婚姻法运动的方针、步骤和方法。
    大会着重解决了开展运动的两个关键性问题：首先是统一了干部的政策思想。参加会的干部中，多数带有急躁情绪，他们对贯彻婚姻法运动应坚持教育的方针这一点了解不深刻，认为这样就“不能使运动搞得彻底”，他们主张要“惩办与教育相结合”；主张在这次运动中解决一切问题。甚至有人主张凡是买卖婚姻都要登记，没收彩礼，决定离合；凡是早婚的都要退婚。会议尖锐地批判了这些错误思想，指出这些思想如不及时纠正，会引起社会上的某些混乱，加深人民内部的矛盾，扩大家庭纠纷，妨碍生产。会议同时也批判了某些干部过分地强调贯彻婚姻法运动与各种工作的矛盾和困难，因而对运动不重视的消极情绪。会议指出，这种思想情绪如不及时纠正，同样会影响运动的开展，使贯彻婚姻法的工作收不到实际的效果。
    此外，从会议上揭发出的一些事实可以看出，在各级干部中还普遍存在着程度不同的夫权统治、重男轻女等封建思想；干涉婚姻自由、虐待妇女等违法乱纪行为也不是个别的。因此，会议强调指出：在贯彻婚姻法运动中必须和反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争结合起来。只有首先肃清干部的封建思想和严肃处理违法乱纪行为，才能保证贯彻婚姻法运动有效地开展。
