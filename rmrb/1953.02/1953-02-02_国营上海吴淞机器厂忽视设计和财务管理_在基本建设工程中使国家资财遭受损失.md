The state-owned Shanghai Wusong Machine Factory, by neglecting design and financial management in capital construction projects, violated financial regulations and caused losses to national property. According to the inspection of the factory's capital construction financial work by the Huadong District Branch of the Bank of Communications, the factory lost over 300 million yuan due solely to inadequate engineering design.

　　Regarding the foundation of the factory's heavy machinery workshop, the Junpu Bureau had backfilled approximately ten feet of soil during the Japanese puppet regime. When design company cadres went to the site to investigate the geological conditions, the factory provided this information. However, the designers did not study this data and proceeded with a blind design. They added the notation "Add piles according to the actual situation during the project's progress" on the blueprint, resulting in pile sinking during construction. Work was forced to stop on October 29, 1951, and the design was reworked. After work resumed on January 2, 1952, the Huadong Construction Engineering Department's First Engineering Office, which contracted the project, failed to supply materials, and work was again forced to stop on April 1 to await materials, not resuming until June 11. These two work stoppages delayed the project by a total of 136 days. The site's grading resulted in a loss of over 140 million yuan due to mid-project plan changes.

　　The factory originally planned to install one 10-ton and one 4.5-ton crane in the heavy machinery workshop, but later changed the plan to 4.5-ton and 1.5-ton cranes. The factory originally planned to build the oil workshop's toilet inside the workshop, which would have wasted workshop floor space and been unsanitary. Only after Soviet experts raised their opinions was it moved outside the workshop. These two changes resulted in a loss of over 50 million yuan. The factory's dormitory project originally planned to complete 30 households in 1951, but because the Municipal Construction Committee was not contacted beforehand, it was discovered when the design was completed and construction was about to begin that the houses were being built on a future road. After repeated consultations, the site was not relocated for construction until 1952. However, in 1952, workers' dormitories had to be built according to unified specifications, and the original design had to be changed. This not only lost 40 million yuan in design fees, but also tied up 600 million yuan in pre-paid contracting fees for nearly a year. Among the materials already purchased, 158,630 Chinese-style tiles and 210 pre-painted doors and windows were unsuitable due to design changes and have not yet been processed.

　　The forging workshop did not conduct thorough geological surveys before the design, and it was not until the design was completed and construction was about to begin that it was discovered that the soil was loose, so construction was stopped, resulting in a loss of 8.73 million yuan in design fees and transportation costs, and 45 tons of steel were tied up.

　　The factory's financial management of capital construction projects was also chaotic. For example, creditor's rights were not handled for a long time, resulting in a serious backlog of funds. According to a check on October 24, 1952, the factory's advance payments totaled more than 16 billion yuan, including 13.6 billion yuan in advance payments for contracting work, 1.3 billion yuan in advance payments to the Huadong Industrial Department Management Office for ordering foreign machinery, and 1.1 billion yuan for ordering other machinery and equipment and various materials, and for design fees. Because some contracted projects had changes, or the project had been completed but not accepted, these advance payments were not settled in a timely manner. For example, among the factory's advance payments for contracting work, the advance payment for the forging workshop project was 3 billion yuan, which had been outstanding for ten months, but the project had been canceled long ago, and the Huadong Construction Engineering Department never settled the account. Only when the inspection discovered it was 2 billion yuan returned, and the remaining 1 billion yuan has not yet been returned.

　　The factory also constantly violated financial regulations in capital construction, and some plans were implemented without approval. Because the factory lacked an overall consideration of the capital construction plan, when it temporarily needed to add factory buildings or increase equipment, it misappropriated production funds to solve the problem. From January 1, 1952, to October 24, the total amount of advances reached more than 1.8 billion yuan, of which more than 1.5 billion yuan had not been returned.

　　The facts fully demonstrate that the financial management of the capital construction project of the state-owned Shanghai Wusong Machine Factory is very chaotic, and has caused great losses to state property. The Huadong Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry should immediately urge the factory to conduct an in-depth inspection, find out the causes of the above problems, and resolutely correct them.

    国营上海吴淞机器厂忽视设计和财务管理
    在基本建设工程中使国家资财遭受损失
    国营上海吴淞机器厂的基本建设工程设计不周，财务管理混乱，违反财政制度，使国家大批资财受到损失。据交通银行华东区行对该厂基本建设财务工作的检查，该厂仅因工程设计不周即损失了三亿多元。该厂重型机工场的地基，在日伪时期，浚浦局曾填土约十尺左右。当设计公司干部赴现场调查地质情况时，厂方曾提供了此项资料。但设计人员并不研究这些资料，即盲目设计。他们在蓝图上加注“在工程进行时视实际情况加桩”字样，致施工时桩木下沉。一九五一年十月二十九日被迫停工，重行设计。一九五二年一月二日复工后，因承包工程的华东建筑工程部第一工程处所购材料供应不上，到四月一日被迫停工待料，至六月十一日才复工。前后二次停工，共拖延工程一百三十六天。该场地坪因中途修改计划，损失一亿四千余万元。该厂原计划在重型机工场安置十吨及四吨半的吊车各一辆，后因变更计划，又改为四吨半和一吨半的。该厂原计划将油料工场的厕所修在场内，这既浪费厂房使用面积，又不卫生。经苏联专家提出意见，才移在工场外面，这两项变更又损失了五千余万元。该厂宿舍工程原计划在一九五一年完成三十户，因事前未与市政建设委员会取得联系，到设计完成将动工时，才发觉房屋造在未来的马路上。经往返商量，拖到一九五二年始迁址建筑。但一九五二年工人宿舍要按统一规格建造，原设计必须变更，这不仅损失了设计费四千万元，而且把预付包工款六亿元积压将近一年。在已购置的材料中，有中式瓦十五万八千六百三十张，已经漆好的门窗二一○樘，因设计改变不能适用，至今尚未处理。锻工场因设计前没有周密进行地质勘测，至设计完成将动工时，始发觉土质松软，停止建造，计损失设计费、运杂费八千七百三十万元，积压钢筋四十五吨。
    该厂基本建设工程财务管理也很混乱。如债权长期不作处理，造成严重的资金积压现象。据一九五二年十月二十四日检查，该厂预付款项共达一百六十亿元，其中预付包工款一百三十六亿元，预付华东工业部经理处订购国外机器款十三亿元，订购其他机器设备及各项器材、付设计费等十一亿元。由于有些包工工程有变动，或工程虽已完成，但未验收等原因，这些预付款都未能及时办理结算。例如，该厂预付包工款中，预付锻工场工程款三十亿元，已有十个月之久，但该项工程早已取消，华东建筑工程部始终未予结账，至检查发觉时才退还了二十亿元，下余十亿元至今还没有退还。
    该厂在基本建设中又不断违反财政制度，有些计划未经批准即行施工。由于该厂对基本建设计划缺乏全盘考虑，临时需要添建厂房、增置设备时，即挪用生产资金解决。自一九五二年一月起至十月二十四日，垫付款总额达十八亿余元，其中有十五亿余元尚未归还。
    事实充分说明国营上海吴淞机器厂基本建设工程的财务管理工作是十分混乱的，并已使国家资财受到了很大的损失。中央第一机械工业部华东办事处应即督促该厂作一次深入的检查，找出产生上述问题的原因，坚决加以纠正。
