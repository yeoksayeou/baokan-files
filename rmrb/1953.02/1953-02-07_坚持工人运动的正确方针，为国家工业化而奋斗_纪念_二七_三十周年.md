Today marks the 30th anniversary of the "February 7th" Massacre, a day when the great Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched its first large-scale political struggle and shed its blood in that struggle. For thirty years, the revolutionary Chinese working class has always held high the glorious banner of the "February 7th" martyrs, standing at the forefront of the people, fighting for China's freedom and liberation. After countless hardships, the Chinese workers and peasants finally defeated the internal and external reactionaries and established the People's Republic of China led by the working class. The working class is no longer a slave but the master of the country.

Before the nationwide liberation, the general goal of the Chinese working-class struggle was to strive for the freedom and liberation of the working class and the people of the whole country and to establish a New Democratic China. To achieve this goal, the working class had to lead the people of the whole country to overthrow the state power of imperialism, the landlord class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. The economic struggle within capitalist enterprises was precisely a form of struggle to mobilize the masses towards the overall revolutionary goal.

However, after the revolution has been won, the working class has become the leading force in state power and personally controls the national economy, the policy of the labor movement should of course undergo a fundamental change along with this fundamental change. The Sixth National Labor Congress, convened in 1948 before the complete liberation of the country, stipulated two fundamentally different tasks for the workers' movement based on the two fundamentally different regions of the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas, and the fundamentally different positions of the working class in these two regions. It designated the development of industrial production as a particularly important task for the workers and staff in the liberated areas. This decision was naturally completely correct. Now that it has been more than three years since the nationwide liberation, our country's trade unions are no longer mass organizations of the oppressed and ruled class, but have become mass organizations of the country's leading class. Our country's trade unions have become an important social pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship, and under the leadership of the Party, they should actively serve the cause of China's construction from New Democracy to socialism. Therefore, the most important task, the regular and central task, of our country's workers' movement and trade union work is to educate and persuade workers in the spirit of communism, to organize workers to work actively, to strive to develop production, and on this basis, to constantly care for and help improve the material and cultural life of the working masses.

In the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the nation's workers have made great efforts, thus enabling industrial production to rapidly recover to and generally exceed the highest level before liberation. The workers in various major industries and in large and medium-sized cities have been largely organized and have raised their political consciousness in the successive social reform and enterprise reform movements, and have improved their living conditions on the basis of production development. Trade union work has been successful, but there are still many shortcomings. The most important is that some trade union workers have had many erroneous understandings of the policy of the workers' movement after the nationwide liberation for a considerable period of time, and these errors have hindered the correct development of the workers' movement. To make the workers' movement further serve the needs of national construction, these erroneous tendencies must be thoroughly corrected.

The erroneous tendency mentioned here is primarily manifested in the erroneous understanding of the nature of our state-owned enterprises, confusing the relationship between the working class and our state-owned enterprises with the relationship between the working class and capitalist enterprises during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, viewing our state-owned enterprises with the perspective of capitalist enterprises, pitting the improvement of workers' material and cultural life against the development of production, and placing trade unions and enterprise administration in opposing positions. This is obviously very wrong.

Today, our state enterprises are socialist in nature. In socialist enterprises, there are no longer any class contradictions. The working class is the master of the country and the master of the enterprise. The workers and staff masses are no longer "wage laborers," and the basic interests of the workers and staff masses are consistent with the basic interests of the country. Developing production and improving social productivity are the basic interests of the country under the leadership of the working class, and also the basic interests of the workers and staff masses. This is a well-known fact. In state-owned enterprises, caring for the lives of the workers and staff masses is right and necessary; bureaucracy that neglects the welfare of the workers and staff masses should be resolutely opposed. However, if we cater to the backward phenomena among the workers, put the partial and immediate interests of the workers first, so that the expanded reproduction of state-owned enterprises cannot be realized, the cause of national industrialization is hindered, and the fundamental interests of the working class are harmed, it is completely wrong.

Therefore, in state-owned enterprises, trade union work must take the development of production as its central task, and must always bear in mind Lenin's instructions in the article "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy": "Trade unions in general are schools of communism; for the entire mass of workers, and for all working people, they should also be schools for learning to manage socialist industry (and later gradually agriculture)." The basic economic law of socialism, as Comrade Stalin said, is "to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole of society by means of the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on the basis of high technology." This basic characteristic and requirement of the socialist economy shows that the production and distribution of our state-owned enterprises are essentially adapted to each other. In addition to paying wages and necessary expenses for workers' welfare, our state-owned enterprises must also continuously increase the country's accumulation, which can be used for expanded reproduction, consolidating national defense, and creating various material and cultural public services for the people, all of which are also needed by our working class. Our state-owned enterprises can only continuously expand reproduction, improve the material and cultural lives of the workers and staff masses, and further meet the needs of the workers and staff masses and the people of the whole country.

Secondly, there are also some erroneous understandings about the tasks of the workers' movement in private enterprises. As mentioned above, developing production and realizing national industrialization are the greatest interests of the liberated working class; therefore, even in private enterprises, the working class should take a responsible attitude towards all production that meets the needs of the country, and should also regard production as its primary task. To ensure that the production of private enterprises plays a positive role in the national economy and the people's livelihood, and does not play a destructive role, it is also necessary to supervise capitalists, prevent their illegal activities, and protect the country's laws and regulations and the legitimate rights and interests of the workers and staff masses. Some people think that since we should unite with capitalists, we should not struggle. This idea is undoubtedly as wrong as the idea of only wanting struggle and not wanting unity. In private enterprises, workers are still "wage laborers," but they can exercise leadership over the bourgeoisie through the state power led by their class. The fact that workers guarantee the implementation of national laws and regulations in private enterprises and fight against the illegal activities of capitalists is to safeguard the interests of the country and their own interests, and to increase the strength of national industrialization.

Finally, there is also a serious erroneous tendency in the understanding of the issue of the Communist Party leading trade unions that must be corrected. As everyone knows, the Communist Party is the highest organizational form of the working class, and the trade union is the mass organization of the working class. The trade union must, under the centralized leadership of the Communist Party, become a link for the Party to contact the masses of the working class. Any tendency to deviate from the leadership of the Communist Party is extremely wrong. For thirty years, the Chinese workers' movement has been able to achieve victory and development in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and in the recovery period of the economy of the new China, all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party. Now that our country has entered a period of large-scale construction, that is, the period of realizing national industrialization, the responsibilities of trade unions are very heavy. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party in trade unions, constantly conducting Marxist-Leninist education among the workers and staff masses, continuously improving their level of consciousness and organization, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff masses to strive for higher labor productivity, are important conditions for realizing national industrialization.

The 30th anniversary of the "February 7th" Movement coincides with the first year of the first Five-Year Plan for our country's national construction. China's industry will have a huge increase in 1953. For example, pig iron will increase by 14 percent, steel ingots will increase by 23 percent, electricity will increase by 27 percent, oil will increase by 42 percent, machine tools will increase by 34 percent, caustic soda will increase by 31 percent, timber will increase by 38 percent, cement will increase by 17 percent, and cotton cloth will increase by 16 percent. These figures show that the Chinese working class is shouldering the great task of leading the entire people to gradually realize national industrialization. The workers of the whole country must unite as one, launch a production competition to increase the quantity of products, improve the quality of products, and reduce the cost of products, and strive to complete and overfulfill the production plan for 1953. To this end, all trade union workers must overcome erroneous tendencies and adhere to correct policies so as to unite the working masses under the leadership of the Party and achieve greater victories on the economic front.

### 坚持工人运动的正确方针，为国家工业化而奋斗——纪念“二七”三十周年

    坚持工人运动的正确方针，为国家工业化而奋斗
    ——纪念“二七”三十周年
    今天是伟大的中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下第一次展开轰轰烈烈的政治斗争，并在斗争中献出了自己的鲜血的“二七”惨案三十周年纪念日。三十年来，中国的革命的工人阶级始终高举着“二七”烈士们的光荣旗帜，站在全体人民的前列，为中国的自由解放而战。中国的工人农民经历了无数的艰难困苦，终于战胜了内外反动派，建立了以工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国。工人阶级已经不再是奴隶，而是国家的主人了。
    在全国没有解放之前，中国工人阶级斗争的总目标是：争取工人阶级和全国人民的自由解放，建立新民主主义的中国。为了达到这一目标，工人阶级必须领导全国人民起来推翻帝国主义、地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的国家政权。而在资本主义企业内部的经济斗争，也正是发动群众奔赴革命总目标的一种斗争形式。
    但是在革命已经胜利，工人阶级成了国家政权中的领导力量，并且亲自掌握了国家经济以后，职工运动的方针当然要随着这个根本变化而根本变化。一九四八年在全国还没有完全解放的情况下召开的第六次全国劳动大会，曾根据国民党统治区和解放区两种根本不同的地区，和工人阶级在这两种地区中根本不同的地位，规定出工人运动的两种根本不同的任务。它把发展工业生产规定为解放区职工的特别重要的任务。这一决定自然是完全正确的。现在全国解放已经三年多了，我国的工会已经不是被压迫、被统治阶级的群众组织，而是已经成为国家的领导阶级的群众组织了。我国的工会已经是人民民主专政的重要的社会支柱，它应该在党的领导下，积极地服务于中国从新民主主义过渡到社会主义的建设事业。因此，我国工人运动和工会工作的最重要的任务，即经常的中心任务，就是要根据共产主义的精神去教育和说服工人，组织工人们积极地劳动，努力地发展生产，并在这个基础上不断地关心和帮助改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活。
    在过去三年多的时间中，全国工人在中国共产党的正确领导下作了伟大的努力，因而使工业生产迅速地恢复到并且一般地超过了解放前的最高水平。各主要产业的工人和大中城市的工人已经绝大部分组织起来，并且在历次的社会改革和企业改革的运动中提高了政治的觉悟，在生产发展的基础上改善了生活的状况。工会工作是有成绩的，但是也还有不少的缺点。最主要的，就是有一部分工会工作者曾经在相当长的时间内对于全国解放后的工人运动的方针还有许多错误的认识，这些错误曾经妨害了工人运动的正确的发展。为了使工人运动进一步服务于国家建设的需要，必须对这些错误倾向加以彻底的纠正。
    这里所说的错误倾向，首先表现在错误地了解我们国营企业的性质，把工人阶级对于我们国营企业的关系和在国民党反动统治时期工人阶级对于资本主义企业的关系混同起来，用看待资本主义企业的眼光来看待我们国营企业，把提高工人的物质文化生活和发展生产互相对立起来，使工会和企业行政方面处在对立的地位。这显然是非常错误的。
    今天我们的国家企业是社会主义性质的经济。在社会主义的企业里，已经没有什么阶级矛盾了。工人阶级是国家的主人，也是企业的主人，职工群众已经不再是什么“雇佣劳动者”，职工群众的基本利益和国家的基本利益是一致的。发展生产，提高社会生产力，是工人阶级领导下的国家的基本利益，也是职工群众的基本利益。这是人所共知的事实。在国营企业里，关心职工群众的生活是应该的，必须的；忽视职工群众福利的官僚主义是应该受到坚决反对的。但如果迁就工人中的落后现象，把工人的局部利益和眼前利益放在第一位，因而使国营企业的扩大再生产无法实现，使国家工业化的事业受到阻碍，使工人阶级的根本利益受到危害，则是完全错误的。
    因此，在国营企业里，工会工作必须以发展生产为中心任务，必须时刻牢记列宁在“新经济政策下职工会底作用与任务”一文中的指示，“职工会一般地是共产主义底学校，它对于全体工人群众以及全体劳动者说来，又应当是学习管理社会主义工业（尔后逐渐也管理农业）底学校。”社会主义的基本经济法则，如同斯大林同志所说，是“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要”。社会主义经济的这个基本特点和要求，表明我国国营企业的生产和分配在本质上是相适应的。我国的国营企业除了支出工资和工人福利事业必要的费用以外，还必须不断地增加国家的积累，用来扩大再生产，巩固国防，创办人民的各种物质的和文化的公益事业，而一切这些，也都是我国工人阶级所需要的。我们的国营企业，只有不断地扩大再生产，才能使职工群众的物质生活和文化生活不断地提高，才能进一步地满足职工群众和全国人民的需要。
    其次，关于私营企业中的职工运动的任务，也有一些错误的认识。如上所述，发展生产，实现国家工业化，是解放了的工人阶级的最大利益；所以即使在私营企业里，工人阶级对于一切符合于国家需要的生产也是要采取负责态度的，也是要把生产当作自己的首要任务的。而为使私营企业的生产对国计民生起积极作用而不起破坏作用，还必须监督资本家，防止他们的违法行为，保障国家法纪和职工群众的合法权利。有的人以为对资本家既要联合就不应该进行斗争。这种想法无疑地和只要斗争不要联合的想法同样是错误的。在私营企业里，职工虽然仍是“雇佣劳动者”，但是已经可以通过自己的阶级所领导的国家政权，施行对于资产阶级的领导了。职工们保障了国家法令在私营企业中的贯彻执行，向资本家的违法行为作斗争，就是保障了国家的利益和自己的利益，就是增加了国家工业化力量。
    最后，在对于共产党领导工会这个问题的认识上，也有一种必须纠正的严重的错误倾向。人所共知，共产党是工人阶级的最高组织形式，工会是工人阶级的群众组织，工会必须在共产党的集中领导之下，成为党联系工人阶级群众的引带。任何脱离共产党领导的倾向都是极端错误的。三十年来，中国工人运动所以能在反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争中，在新中国经济的恢复时期获得胜利和发展，都是由于有共产党的领导。现在我国进入大规模建设时期，即实现国家工业化时期，工会的责任是很重大的。因此，加强共产党在工会中的领导，在职工群众当中经常进行马克思列宁主义的教育，不断地提高他们的觉悟程度和组织程度，高度发挥职工群众的积极性、创造性，为更高的劳动生产率而斗争，乃是实现国家工业化的重要条件。
    “二七”运动的三十周年，正当我国国家建设的第一个五年计划的第一年。我国工业在一九五三年内将有巨大的增涨，例如生铁将增长百分之一十四，钢锭将增长百分之二十三，电力将增长百分之二十七，石油将增长百分之四十二，工具机将增长百分之三十四，烧碱将增长百分之三十一，木材将增长百分之三十八，水泥将增长百分之一十七，棉布将增长百分之一十六。这些数字说明我国工人阶级正在负担着领导全体人民逐步地实现国家工业化的伟大任务。全国工人必须万众一心，展开增加产品数量、提高产品质量、降低产品成本的生产竞赛，为完成和超额完成一九五三年的生产计划而奋斗。为此目的，全体工会工作者必须克服错误倾向，坚持正确方针，以便在党的领导下团结工人群众取得经济战线上的更伟大的胜利。
