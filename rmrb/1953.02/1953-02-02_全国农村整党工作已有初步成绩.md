    The Chinese Communist Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas across the country have been universally carrying out work to consolidate the Party's organization and the ideological style of its members (hereinafter referred to as "Party Consolidation") since November of last year. This work has played a significant role in raising the ideological awareness of Communist Party members, promoting the correct path of rural economic cooperation and collectivization, changing the coercive commandism prevalent among some Party members, and strengthening the Party's ties with the masses.
    Over the past few years, the Chinese Communist Party's grassroots organizations and members in rural areas have actively led peasants to participate in the land reform struggle. After the land reform, they implemented the Party's policy of organizing and developing agricultural production, led peasants to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, increased agricultural production, continuously improved the rural economy and the lives of peasants, and further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas. However, due to the development of the rural economy, the emergence of a new rich peasant economy, and the spontaneous influence of small-scale peasant economy developing capitalism, some Communist Party members in rural areas began to foster rich peasant ideology and engage in exploitative behavior. In some Communist Party members, coercive commandism and illegal and undisciplined phenomena were also very serious, affecting the Party's ideological and organizational consolidation, making it impossible to implement the Party's various policies effectively. In response to this situation, the CPC Central Committee decided to universally and systematically carry out the work of consolidating the Party's organization and the ideological style of its members in rural areas, to educate Party members on the standards of Communist Party members, to clarify the direction of rural economic development, to oppose capitalist ideas and exploitative behavior of rich peasants among Communist Party members, as well as the resulting corruption, degeneration, illegal and undisciplined phenomena, and commandism, to raise the class consciousness of Party members, to purify and consolidate the Party's organization, to improve and strengthen the Party's leadership over the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the Party's ties with the people, and to ensure that the Party's policies are correctly implemented in rural areas.
    The Party consolidation work in various regions started in batches and systematically from November of last year and has achieved initial results. The first phase of the Party consolidation work in the three major regions of Northeast, North China, and Northwest China concluded successively at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and experiences are currently being summarized. In some areas, the second phase of the Party consolidation work has already begun. During the first phase of Party consolidation in the Northeast Region, a total of 1,008 districts opened Party consolidation training classes, with over 219,600 trainees, including over 113,600 Communist Party members and over 106,000 non-Party activists. In the North China Region, more than 11,000 village branches, with approximately 200,000 Communist Party members, participated in the first phase of Party consolidation. In the Northwest Region, a total of 1,461 branches and 36,628 Communist Party members participated in Party consolidation study. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong and Anhui provinces and the former Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region in East China, out of 20,800 township branches, 1,512 township branches have completed the Party consolidation work, and another 281 districts are carrying out Party consolidation by district. The Party consolidation work in the Central South Region is also proceeding intensely. In Henan Province, all counties north of the Yellow River have completed Party consolidation work in 1,885 township branches, and in the counties south of the Yellow River, the Party consolidation work in the first batch of more than 2,000 township branches has been largely completed.
    Various regions have made full preparations before the Party consolidation, which is an important key to ensuring the healthy progress of Party consolidation. The most important thing in the preparatory work is to establish a strong leadership organization and to allocate and train cadres. Party committees at all levels in the North China Region and Shandong Province have established Party consolidation offices. Before the Party consolidation, more than 45,000 cadres were selected and concentrated for training, learning the policies, principles, content, and methods of Party consolidation. The provinces and counties in the Northeast Region trained 8,147 Party consolidation cadres and Party consolidation instructors. The Northwest Region also trained more than 5,000 organizers before the Party consolidation. Before the start of Party consolidation, various regions also conducted in-depth publicity to Party members, non-Party activists, and the broad masses of people, explaining the significance of Party consolidation, explaining policies, and gaining the support of the masses for this work. Some regions in the Northeast also helped arrange village work and solved the family life problems of Party members participating in the study when they were selected to concentrate on training, so that they could participate in Party consolidation study without any worries.
    In the Party consolidation, various regions generally grasped the principle of education, and on the basis of improvement, carried out criticism and self-criticism. Combining with the specific situation, they explained policies to Party members, dispelled concerns, and inspired Party members to consciously review themselves according to the standards of Party members. In regions that have done this, the Party consolidation work can proceed smoothly and the gains are great. The methods of Party consolidation in various regions are roughly two types: one is to concentrate on training by district (including mobilization, education, organizational consolidation, and other steps) and then return to the village to conduct democratic make-up lessons (soliciting opinions from the masses and conducting self-criticism). This approach has better results due to centralized leadership; the other is to adopt the method of giving lectures in batches (one area) and consolidating village by village in areas with a large number of Party members and many branches. During the Party consolidation, the provinces in the Northeast also organized movies, slides, and art troupes to go to the countryside, and invited peasant representatives who had returned from visiting the Soviet Union to give reports, enriching the content of communist education.
    In the areas where Party consolidation has been carried out, the ideological awareness of Communist Party members has been significantly improved, the exploitative ideas and behaviors of rich peasants have been corrected, and the confidence and determination to lead peasants towards cooperation and collectivization have been strengthened. On this basis, rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations have also been further consolidated and developed. According to statistics from Anyang, Puyang, Tangyin, Qi County, and Jun County in Henan Province, 964 new mutual aid teams were developed after the Party consolidation, and more than 100 temporary mutual aid teams were converted into year-round mutual aid teams. In the eight key-point townships in Qidong County, Shandong Province, there were 339 Party members, but only 84 of them participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations before the Party consolidation, and this number increased to 315 after the Party consolidation (the rest could not participate due to objective conditions). After the Party consolidation, some Party members' "retreating slope" thinking and coercive commandism have also been improved, their enthusiasm for work has been greatly increased, and their relationship with the masses has become closer. The masses in some Party consolidation key-point townships in Wendeng Prefecture, Shandong Province, reflected that the performance of Party members after the Party consolidation has three advantages: first, they are good at leading production; second, their attitudes and methods are good; and third, their families are harmonious. In addition, branches in various regions that have undergone Party consolidation have also eliminated a small number of seriously degenerated and deteriorated bad elements, thereby further purifying the Party's grassroots organizations and strengthening the Party's leadership role in rural areas.

    全国农村整党工作已有初步成绩
     【新华社一日讯】中国共产党在全国各地农村中的基层组织，从去年十一月开始，普遍进行了整顿党的组织和党员思想作风的工作（以下简称整党）。这个工作对于提高共产党员的思想觉悟，推动农村经济正确地走向合作化、集体化的道路以及改变在部分党员中存在的强迫命令作风，加强党与群众的联系，起了很大作用。
    几年来，中国共产党在农村中的基层组织和党员，积极领导农民参加了土地改革的斗争，在土地改革后贯彻党的组织起来发展农业生产的政策，领导农民参加互助合作组织，提高了农业生产，使农村经济和农民生活不断上升，并进一步巩固了农村中人民民主专政。但是，由于农村经济的发展，新的富农经济的出现和小农经济自发地发展着资本主义的影响，农村中一部分共产党员开始滋长着富农思想和产生剥削行为。在某些共产党员中，强迫命令的作风和违法乱纪现象也很严重，影响到党在思想上和组织上的巩固，使党的各种政策不能很好地贯彻执行。针对这种情况，中共中央决定在农村中普遍地有步骤地进行整顿党的组织和党员思想作风的工作，向党员进行关于共产党员标准的教育，明确农村经济发展方向，反对在共产党员中的资本主义思想和富农的剥削行为，以及由此产生的贪污蜕化违法乱纪的现象和命令主义作风，以提高党员的阶级觉悟，纯洁和巩固党的组织，改进和加强党对农村互助合作运动的领导以及党和人民群众的联系，保证党的政策在农村中得以正确贯彻施行。
    各地整党工作从去年十一月开始即分批地有步骤地进行，并取得了初步成绩。东北、华北、西北三大区的第一期整党工作已在去年年底和今年一月初先后结束，目前正在总结经验。有些地区第二期整党工作已经开始。东北区在第一期整党中，共有一千零八个区开办了整党训练班，受训人数有二十一万九千六百多人，其中共产党员十一万三千六百多人，非党积极分子十万六千多人。华北区参加第一期整党的共有一万一千多个村支部，约二十万共产党员。西北区共有一千四百六十一个支部和三万六千六百二十八名共产党员参加了整党学习。华东区据山东、安徽两省和原苏北行政区的不完全统计：在二万零八百个乡支部中，已有一千五百十二个乡支部结束了整党工作，另外有二百八十一个区正在以区为单位进行整党。中南区的整党工作也在紧张进行。河南省黄河以北各县已有一千八百八十五个乡支部完成整党工作，黄河以南各县参加第一批整党的二千多个乡支部，整党工作已大部完成。
    各地在整党前都做了充分的准备工作，这是保证整党能够健康地进行的重要关键。在准备工作中最重要的是建立强有力的领导组织和调配、训练干部。华北区和山东省的各级党委都成立了整党办公室。华北区各地在整党前共抽调了四万五千余名干部集中训练，学习了整党的政策、方针、内容和方法。东北区各省、县训练了八千一百四十七名整党干部和整党教员。西北区在整党前也训练了五千多名组织员。各地在整党开始前，还向党员、非党积极分子和广大群众进行深入宣传，说明整党意义，交代政策，并使这一工作取得群众的拥护和支持。东北有些地区在抽调党员集中训练时，还帮助安排了村里的工作，解决了参加学习的党员的家庭生活问题，使他们毫无牵挂地参加整党学习。
    各地在整党中，一般掌握了教育的方针，在提高的基础上，开展批评与自我批评。并结合具体情况，向党员交代政策，消除顾虑，启发党员自觉地按照党员标准进行检讨。凡是这样做的地区，整党工作就能顺利进行，收获也大。各地整党的方式大体上有两种：一是以区为单位，集中训练（包括动员、教育、组织整理等步骤）然后回村进行民主补课（在群众中征求意见并进行检讨），这种做法由于领导集中，效果较好；二是在党员数量较大、支部较多的地区，则采用分片（一片地区）讲课、分村整顿的方式。在整党中，东北各省还组织了电影、幻灯和文工团下乡，邀请从苏联参观回来的农民代表作报告，使进行的共产主义的教育，增加了丰富的活泼的内容。
    已经整党的地区，共产党员的思想觉悟显著提高，纠正了富农的剥削思想和行为，加强了领导农民走向合作化和集体化的信心和决心，在这一基础上，农村的互助合作组织也进一步获得巩固和发展。据河南省安阳、濮阳、汤阴、淇县、浚县五个县的统计：整党后新发展了九百六十四个互助组，并有一百多个临时互助组转为常年互助组。山东省齐东县八个基点乡共有三百三十九个党员，整党前参加互助合作组织的只有八十四人，整党后增加到三百一十五人（其余因客观条件限制不能参加）。经过整党以后，某些党员的“退坡”思想和强迫命令作风也有了改进，工作积极性大大提高，和群众关系更加密切。山东省文登专区有些整党基点乡的群众反映：整党后，党员表现有三好：一是领导生产好，二是态度、方式好，三是家庭和睦好。此外，各地经过整党的支部，还清除了少数严重蜕化变质的坏分子，从而进一步纯洁了党的基层组织，加强了党在农村中的领导作用。
