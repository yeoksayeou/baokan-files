    Main Points of Readers' Letters in Two Weeks

    Due to the Spring Festival holiday, the main points of readers' letters from February 9th to 22nd, for two weeks, are published together; in the future, they will still be published once a week.

    From February 9th to 22nd, our newspaper's Readers' Letters Group received a total of 3,765 readers' letters, and various agencies replied to 530 letters.

    Among the letters concerning the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, letters exposing suppression of criticism accounted for a considerable number. These letters show that the suppression of criticism by leaders of certain agencies has stifled the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the people, and has provided a breeding ground for bureaucratic behavior and violations of law and discipline. Therefore, extensively and thoroughly exposing and handling suppression of criticism is the key to opposing bureaucracy and violations of law and discipline. In addition, many letters expose the patriarchal leadership style and various illegal and undisciplined behaviors of leading cadres in county-level institutions such as various professional companies, grain bureaus, tax bureaus, and cooperatives within the financial and economic system.

    Among the letters concerning economic construction, readers reflected on serious casualties caused by the collapse of workers' sheds at several capital construction sites, as well as the neglect of workers' welfare at some water conservancy project sites, causing serious difficulties in the lives of the migrant workers. These letters show that during the country's large-scale economic construction, the erroneous idea of only focusing on production and ignoring the interests of workers will cause enormous harm and must be corrected. Some letters also criticized the departmentalism of several production units, exposing their unwillingness to actively transfer technical cadres and machinery to support capital construction units. This practice of only caring about oneself and not caring about others has caused undue losses to the country.

    Around the Spring Festival, many letters from local people's governments, revolutionary soldiers, and families of martyrs and soldiers reported on local work concerning preferential treatment and support for the army, and on the army's work of cherishing the people and supporting the government.

    During the two weeks, we received over one hundred letters criticizing the chaotic situation in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals by post and telecommunications bureaus in various regions. We also received many letters criticizing the administrative leaders of factories and organizations for simply emphasizing the importance of work and production, while ignoring the cultural study work of employees during their spare time, as well as letters criticizing certain universities and specialized schools for violating central regulations and arbitrarily retaining graduate students.

### 两周读者来信主要情况

专栏：读者来信摘要

    两周读者来信主要情况
    因为春节休假的缘故，二月九日到二十二日两周读者来信的主要情况并在一次发表；今后仍是每周发表一次。
    二月九日到二十二日两周中，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信三千七百六十五件，各机关答复读者的信五百三十件。
    在有关反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争的来信中，揭发压制批评的来信占相当数量。从这些来信中可以看出，某些机关领导干部的压制批评行为已经窒息了广大干部群众的积极性，使官僚主义行为和违法乱纪行为得到了滋长的温床。因此，广泛而深入地揭发、处理压制批评行为正是反对官僚主义、反对违法乱纪的关键问题。此外，有许多来信揭发了财经系统中各专业公司、粮食局、税务局以及合作社等县级机构领导干部家长式的领导作风和各种违法乱纪的行为。
    在有关经济建设的来信中，读者反映了几个基本建设工地因工棚倒塌造成严重伤亡事故以及有的水利工程工地忽视工人生活福利，使民工生活发生严重困难等情况。这些来信说明：在国家进行大规模经济建设的时候，只顾生产不管工人利益的错误思想将会造成巨大的危害，必须加以纠正。还有些来信批判了几个生产单位的本位主义思想，揭发他们不愿积极抽调技术干部和机器支援基本建设单位，这种只顾自己、不管别人的做法，造成了国家不应有的损失。
    春节前后，各地人民政府、革命军人、烈军属等报告当地优抚工作和部队拥政爱民工作情况的来信很多。
    两周中，我们收到一百多件批评各地邮电局报刊发行工作中混乱现象的来信。还收到不少批评工厂、机关行政领导单纯强调业务和生产的重要，而漠视职工业余文化学习工作的来信以及某些大学专科学校违反中央规定，任意留用毕业学生的来信。
