    Severe Bureaucratic Work Style Causes Bad Impact:
    Lin Qiumu's High-Yield Achievements Were Originally Fake
    [Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper's special correspondent Liu Yuefeng reports: The new national record for the highest yield of double-cropping rice announced last year by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, created by farmer Lin Qiumu of Minhou County, Fujian Province, in 1951, is inaccurate. This error was discovered in the summer of last year, but it has not been corrected.
    Lin Qiumu is a high-yield rice farmer in Panyang Township, 14th District, Minhou County, Fujian Province. In 1952, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Fujian Provincial People's Government reported his 1951 double-cropping rice yield as an average of 1,790 jin per mu, which earned Lin Qiumu an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. This figure was the highest double-cropping rice yield in the country in 1951, and Lin Qiumu was thus named a national model for high-yield double-cropping rice in 1951. However, the actual situation was not like this. The area of Lin Qiumu's high-yield field was originally reported as 3.6 mu, but after an on-site measurement after the summer harvest of 1952, it turned out to be 4.711 mu. Using this mu number to average the yield, it was only 1,372 jin per mu.
    From this incident of Lin Qiumu's misreporting of high-yield figures, many serious shortcomings in the work of Fujian Province's agricultural leading organs in implementing the high-yield award policy and cultivating labor models were exposed.
    First, there is a lack of a serious and conscientious spirit in implementing the high-yield award policy, which demonstrates a serious bureaucratic work style of reporting falsely at every level and irresponsibility. In February 1952, the Fourth District Committee of the Minhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first discovered Lin Qiumu's high-yield achievement. Without investigating the area of Lin Qiumu's high-yield field, they rashly reported it to the Minhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government. After receiving the report, the county leading organs did not conduct investigation and research, and on the one hand, reported it to the Minhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Rural Work Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and other organs; on the other hand, they issued a circular on "Lin Qiumu's High-Yield Situation" to the entire county. After receiving the report, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Provincial People's Government sent cadres to Minhou County for investigation. However, these cadres were very irresponsible. When they arrived at Lin Qiumu's field, they just casually measured it with a rope, and simply held a so-called "representative meeting of peasants," "passed" Lin Qiumu's yield figures, and took back a piece of paper about Lin Qiumu's high-yield experience, thinking that "everything was fine." The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Fujian Provincial People's Government then reported Lin Qiumu's high-yield achievements to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government based on this report. This resulted in false reports at every level, from the district deceiving the county, the county deceiving the province, and the province deceiving the central government, damaging the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. It was not until the summer harvest of 1952 that the agricultural leading organs of Fujian Province discovered that Lin Qiumu's yield report was inaccurate. During the summer harvest, Lin Qiumu's high-yield field's rice was threshed and dried separately, and many people were organized to observe and inspect it. The masses reflected that the area of Lin Qiumu's high-yield field was not that small. After seven measurements, it was confirmed that the area of the high-yield field was 1.11 mu larger than the originally reported figure. At this time, the leading organs of Fujian Province were shocked, but they did not report it in time to correct the mistake.
    Second, there is a lack of cultivation and education for high-yield models, and formalistic and commandist methods are used to establish high-yield banners. Panyang Township, where Lin Qiumu lives, is only a little over a mile away from the seat of the county-level leading organs and not far from the district government; however, from March to mid-June of last year, the county and district have not strengthened leadership and education for him. During the spring plowing of 1952, when district cadres went to Panyang Township to mobilize Lin Qiumu to participate in the production increase competition, they not only did not conduct careful mobilization and education for him and help him formulate practical and feasible production increase plans, but forced him to say: "It is not acceptable not to increase production, you must increase production by 20%." The district cadres formulated an unrealistic production increase plan for him, requiring him to create a high-yield record of 2,054 jin per mu in 1952. Some parts of the plan are inexplicable. The plan stipulates that 49 dan of cow dung should be used per mu. Lin Qiumu said: "That's not true. I only put 19 dan of cow dung per mu of field." The plan stipulates that weeding should be done seven times. Lin Qiumu said: "I only said five times at that time." Lin Qiumu organized a mutual aid team (a total of 17 households) in April 1952. In name, it was directly led by the county leading organs, but after its establishment, it was actually without leadership. No production increase plan was formulated within the team, mutual assistance was not frequent, and labor exchange was not of equal value. Lin Qiumu was at a loss for how to lead the mutual aid team. He said: "I don't know how to 'help each other.' What am I supposed to lead?" It was not until the Provincial Rural Production Work Conference in June last year that it pointed out that the Minhou County leading organs should strengthen specific leadership and cultivation for Lin Qiumu. Later, the Rural Work Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a working group to work in the township, but the county and district leading organs relied on the working group, and the working group believed that the county and district should bear the main responsibility for education and cultivation. Because Lin Qiumu lacked political education, he developed a tendency to become detached from the masses and indifferent to politics. He did not teach production techniques to the masses in his township, and showed arrogance to the labor models and peasants from various townships who came to visit the high-yield field. Lin Qiumu was also not modest in learning new technologies and was content with his old experience. When planting in the spring of last year, he still made 8-foot seedling beds according to the old rules, instead of making suitable seedling fields (4-foot beds). Last year, he also used plant ash to pave the cattle pen, which caused the nitrogen in the cow dung to react chemically with the plant ash, losing the fertilizer effect. These sowing and fertilizer accumulation methods were unreasonable and have not been criticized as they should be.

    严重的官僚主义作风造成恶劣影响
    林求姆的丰产成绩原来是假的
    【本报讯】本报特约记者刘岳峰报道：去年中央人民政府农业部公布的福建省闽侯县农民林求姆创造的一九五一年全国双季间作稻最高产量新纪录，是不确实的。这个错误在去年夏季即已发现，但一直没有得到纠正。
    林求姆是福建省闽侯县十四区泮洋乡的水稻丰产户。一九五二年福建省人民政府农林厅把他的一九五一年的双季间作稻产量报成每亩平均一千七百九十斤，使林求姆获得了中央人民政府农业部的奖励。这个数字是一九五一年全国双季间作稻产量的最高数字，林求姆因此被评为一九五一年全国双季间作稻丰产模范。可是实际情况并不是这样。林求姆的丰产田的面积原报为三亩六分，在一九五二年夏收后，经过实地丈量，却是四亩七分一厘，以这个亩数来平均产量，每亩只有一千三百七十二斤。
    从林求姆丰产数字呈报失实的这一事件中，暴露了福建省农业领导机关在执行丰产奖励政策和培养劳动模范工作中的许多严重缺点。
    第一，对执行丰产奖励政策缺乏严肃认真的精神，表现了层层假报、不负责任的严重的官僚主义作风。一九五二年二月间，闽侯县中共第四区区委会首先发现了林求姆的丰产事实，他们没有调查林求姆丰产田的面积，就草率地把它报到中共闽侯县委会和县人民政府。县领导机关接到报告后，也没有经过调查研究，就一面上报到中共闽侯地委会和中共福建省委农村工作委员会、省人民政府农林厅等机关，一面向全县发出“林求姆丰产情况”的通报。省人民政府农林厅接到报告后，曾经派干部到闽侯县作过调查。但这些干部都很不负责任，他们到了林求姆的田里，只用绳子草率地量了一下，又简单地开了一个所谓“农民代表会”，“通过”了林求姆的产量数字，拿回一纸林求姆丰产经验，就算“百事大吉”了。福建省人民政府农林厅就根据这个报告，把林求姆的丰产成绩呈报到中央人民政府农业部。这就造成了区骗县，县骗省，省骗中央的层层假报告，损害了党和人民政府的威信。直到一九五二年夏收时，福建省的农业领导机关才发现林求姆的产量呈报失实。夏收中，林求姆的丰产田的稻谷实行单打单晒，同时还组织了许多群众来观摩和验收。群众纷纷反映：林求姆的丰产田面积不只那么大。经过七次丈量，证实丰产田面积比原报数字大了一亩一分一厘。这时福建省领导机关才吃了一惊，但不及时上报，纠正错误。
    第二，对丰产模范缺乏培养教育，用形式主义和命令主义的作法树立丰产旗帜。林求姆所住的泮洋乡，离县级领导机关所在地只有一里多路，离区政府也不远；但是从去年三月起到六月中旬止，县和区一直没有对他加强领导教育。一九五二年春耕时，区干部到泮洋乡发动林求姆参加增产竞赛，不但没有对他进行细致的动员教育，帮助他制订切实可行的增产计划，反而强迫命令说：“不增产不行，一定要增产二成。”区干部替他订出了脱离实际的增产计划，要求他一九五二年创造每亩产量二千零五十四斤的丰产纪录。计划中有些地方是莫名其妙的。计划规定每亩要用四十九担牛粪，林求姆说：“没有这回事，我每亩田只下十九担牛粪就够了。”计划规定锄七次草，林求姆说：“我当时只讲五次。”林求姆在一九五二年四月间组织了一个互助组
    （共十七户），名义上是由县领导机关直接领导，但成立以后，实际是无人领导，组内没有订增产计划，互助不经常，换工不等价。林求姆对互助组的领导束手无策，他说：“我不晓得怎么‘互助’法，叫我领导什么？”直到去年六月间，省农村生产工作会议才指出闽侯县领导机关应对林求姆加强具体领导和培养。后来中共福建省委农村工作委员会派了一个工作组到该乡工作，但县、区领导机关依赖工作组，工作组又认为县区要负主要教育培养的责任。因为对林求姆缺少政治教育，他就发生了脱离群众和不问政治的倾向。他对本乡群众不大传授生产技术，对前来参观丰产田的各乡劳动模范和农民，表现自高自大。林求姆对新的技术学习也不虚心，满足于他的老经验，去年春耕播种时仍是按旧规矩做了八尺秧畦，而没有做合式秧田（四尺畦）去年他还用草木灰铺垫牛栏，结果使牛粪里的氮素和草木灰起化学作用，损失了肥效。这些播种、积肥的方法都不合理，也都没有得到应有的批判。
