Golden Star Medal Winner – Ren Guodong
By our reporter Tian Liu

	Fengchan County and the Golden Star Medal

	Before last summer, the farmers of Zhaoyuan County [Note 1] always liked to talk about the harvest of 1950. “That year, if you wanted wind, you got wind; if you needed water, it rained. It was truly favorable weather.” The farmers said, “We’d never seen such a good harvest. Each hectare yielded four shi and nine dou [Note 2]. Never in our memory had we harvested so much grain.” But now, the farmers of Zhaoyuan County say, “What was 1950? This is what you call a harvest; we didn't have enough space to store the grain.” In 1952, Zhaoyuan County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield of all land was seven shi and five dou per hectare. “But then again," the farmers said regretfully, "if we had weather as favorable as in 1950, not to mention seven shi and five, it wouldn't have escaped ten shi!”

	In 1952, the crops in Zhaoyuan County suffered many torments, and agricultural production was carried out amidst numerous disasters. In the spring, there were windstorms, and on more than eight thousand hectares of land, some were covered with thick sand, preventing the seeds from sprouting; others sprouted but were killed by the strong winds. In the summer, when the seedlings needed water, the entire county experienced a severe drought. In lightly affected areas, it didn't rain for twenty or thirty days; in severely affected areas, it didn't rain for fifty-seven consecutive days. Many crops were damaged by the drought. Even a slight breeze could cause the dried leaves to rustle and fall. In early autumn, just as the crops were about to be harvested, a torrential rain caused the Songhua River to overflow its banks, and the crops suffered from flooding. The fields were filled with water, and large fish weighing one or two jin could be caught in the sorghum fields. It goes without saying that grain couldn't be harvested from 14,000 hectares of land; even the stalks didn't make it home. More land suffered varying degrees of reduced yield.

	However, in 1952, Zhaoyuan achieved a bumper harvest, an unprecedented bumper harvest. If we exclude the 14,000 hectares of land where no grain was harvested, the county's total harvest area was 93,701 hectares. Each hectare yielded 3436.5 jin of grain. This greatly exceeded the bumper harvest of 1950. It even increased production by 92.9 percent compared to 1951, almost doubling it. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government awarded it the honorary title of "Fengchan County" (bumper harvest county).

	How was this achieved?

	Comrade Ren Guodong, the secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, created a cultivation method suitable for local conditions. It was this cultivation method that enabled Zhaoyuan County to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. It received the honorary title of "Fengchan County." Comrade Ren Guodong also became a "Patriotic Fengchan Model Worker" and received the Patriotic Fengchan Golden Star Medal issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

	How did Comrade Ren Guodong create this cultivation method? Why couldn't it be created elsewhere, but he could create it? How does this county committee secretary work?

	How he treats the Party's tasks

	In December 1952, on a freezing day, I went to visit Comrade Ren Guodong. When I arrived at the County Committee, he was discussing the patriotic Fengchan movement for 1953 with the Minister of Propaganda.

	"Take Li Jingchun, a farmer from Yongfa Village," he continued his conversation, "In 1952, he created a record of harvesting 31 shi per hectare. Can he maintain this yield in 1953? Can he improve it even further?"

	Ren Guodong spoke as slowly and calmly as he paced back and forth in the room, as if he was always ready to stop and listen to others' opinions. And he really did stop and listen to the Minister of Propaganda's opinion. I remembered the evaluation of him that the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had given me a few days ago in the provincial capital: Comrade Ren Guodong is pragmatic, thorough, and good at discovering and studying problems....

	"Not necessarily? That's right, that's where the problem lies." He agreed with the Minister of Propaganda's opinion: "Our responsibility is to make it certain." Comrade Ren Guodong emphasized the words "make it certain": "We must ensure that high yields continue to increase and that low yields catch up quickly. This is the basic task of our leadership in agricultural production in 1953."

	While the broad masses of farmers were celebrating the harvest and investing themselves in winter production with unprecedented enthusiasm, and preparing to implement new cultivation methods next year with the greatest excitement and determination; while farmers and cadres from various provinces in Northeast China were coming to Zhaoyuan County by the hundreds and thousands to learn new cultivation methods and visit Fengchan County; while newspapers everywhere were repeatedly publicizing and praising this great victory of Zhaoyuan County on the agricultural production front, Comrade Ren Guodong was already preoccupied with planning the production for 1953.

	"That's just how he is." Afterwards, Comrade Shi Kailing, the Minister of Propaganda, said to me: "When cadres are troubled by work difficulties, he always says with a smile: This is also a favorable condition, that is also a favorable condition; when cadres feel confident and sure of their work, he raises: We will encounter this obstacle, that difficulty, making people not dare to be careless at all, not dare to slack off for a moment."

	The situation at the beginning of the 1952 spring plowing was like this.

	On April 10th, while many rural areas in nearby counties were still quiet and inactive, the spring plowing work in Zhaoyuan County was already in full swing; the spring wheat sowing work had been completed; manure fertilizer for the large fields had been delivered to the fields; on the basis of the Party's education of the peasants on the new and old paths, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the county developed rapidly. The scale was unprecedentedly expanded, the quality was increasingly improved, and three agricultural production cooperatives even emerged. Comrade Gao Gang's call to "increase grain production by five dou per hectare" had already been inscribed on the patriotic production increase plan of every village and every mutual aid group -- all kinds of work were progressing smoothly, even it can be said that it was "victoriously launched."

	However, at this time, Comrade Ren Guodong was studying a problem, and he had been thinking about it for a long time.

	One night, it was already very late, but Comrade Ren Guodong was still pacing back and forth in the house -- this was his habit, he often pondered like this when a problem in his mind could not be solved. His wife, Comrade Zhao Feng, a cadre in the County Committee's Organization Department, couldn't bear it any longer and urged him to rest for the fifth time. He stopped and suddenly asked, "How can we say that we have completed the Party's task?"

	"That's fulfilling the Party's requirements!" Comrade Zhao Feng answered definitely and clearly: "For example, the Party calls for an increase of five dou of grain per hectare. If five dou more were actually harvested in autumn, that would be completing the Party's task."

	"It is because we treat the Party's tasks in this way that our work always proceeds so calmly." Comrade Ren Guodong said: "If Comrade Gao Gang called for an increase of three dou, would our production increase plan uniformly prescribe three dou? What if he called for eight dou?"

	Comrade Zhao Feng did not answer, but she admitted in her heart: "Then it would surely be three dou, eight dou."

	"So, sometimes fulfilling the Party's requirements does not mean truly completing the Party's task." Comrade Ren Guodong emphasized the four words "sometimes" and "truly" to the point of surprising Zhao Feng, and continued: "Doing the work to the best of our ability is truly completing the Party's task."

	A few days later, Comrade Ren Guodong raised this issue at the joint meeting of the District Committee secretaries. He said that Zhaoyuan County's agricultural production in 1950 had already exceeded the pre-liberation level. The recovery stage had passed, and the future was about development. "Recovery still has a past standard, but development is another matter. No one can set a standard for us." He said:

	"Comrade Gao Gang's call includes areas with poor soil and weak work foundations. We are not such areas. Our production increase task should not be five dou, but one shi, two shi, or maybe even more."

	At the end of the meeting, the District Committee secretaries agreed with Comrade Ren Guodong's opinion: re-revise and improve the patriotic production increase plan and strive for a greater harvest.

	That's how it was resisted

	Mengkeli Village is the best working village in the county. The Party's foundation is strong, the masses' awareness is high, and all the farmers in the village have joined mutual aid groups. Under the leadership of Sun Jingyun, the county's famous model party member and model cadre, the work has been done well over the years, and it has been selected as a model village in the county several times. Therefore, the County Committee selected it as a key village and sent a work team to specifically help and lead Mengkeli Village's bumper harvest movement.

	In order to make Mengkeli Village's bumper harvest movement a model and promote the county's patriotic Fengchan movement, the village branch, with the help of the work team, carried out a series of propaganda and education work among the masses. By the end of March, the farmers in the village had a relatively clear understanding of the relationship between patriotic production increase and national construction, the relationship between patriotic Fengchan and improving their own lives, and the direction of rural economic development, etc. It can be said that it had "deeply rooted in people's hearts and was known to every household." The masses' production enthusiasm was very high. Based on this situation, the branch shifted its work to specific organizational work -- leading the masses to make patriotic production increase plans.

	The problem arose in making the production increase plans.

	The plans made by each group were all five or six dou higher than in 1951. However, 1951 was a year of poor harvest. The average yield in the county was only a little more than four shi per hectare. Mengkeli Village was a good working village, and each hectare only yielded six shi and two dou. Adding the increased five or six dou, it still couldn't catch up with the average yield of eight shi and four dou per hectare in the village in 1950.

	If such a good village is like this, how can the county's Fengchan movement be carried out well? The County Committee's work team and the branch, in accordance with the instructions of the County Committee, once again mobilized the masses to raise the production increase plans and revise the production increase plans.

	"It's easy to make plans, but it only counts if they can be realized!" Old farmers said: "Sow on the land, harvest from the sky. If God doesn't send rain, no matter how high the plan is, it's useless." More farmers said: "Our village's land can barely yield six or seven shi." Because the branch's work of re-revising the plan was done too hastily, some people fundamentally doubted the matter of making plans. They said: "Pointing to the son doesn't raise the mother, pointing to the land doesn't harvest grain, and children calculated out are not easy to raise." -- Seeing that things were not right, the branch immediately changed its working methods: using the facts of the village to publicize the possibility of increasing production to the masses. In 1951, the millet and sorghum of the village's farmers Lu Tingbin and Sun Jingshan yielded 17 shi per hectare. The branch publicized their deeds. However, after hearing it, the masses said:

	"There are so many families in our village, only three or two of them. Who knows how they managed to get so lucky!"

	"Or maybe their land acreage is large, and they say two hectares are one."

	The branch said that their land acreage was not large, and it was not because they were lucky. It was because their land was carefully cultivated. When the masses heard this, they became even more annoyed. They said: "Three years ago, you said deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, more hoeing and weeding, more fertilizer! Don't you think it's tiresome. Which family in our village doesn't do this? How come we didn't harvest this much grain?"

	All kinds of work have been done, but it is still not possible to raise the production increase plan. The branch and the work team jointly held several meetings to check their work and study ways to improve it. The result of the discussion was to first "break through a point" and then promote the work of revising the production increase plan in the village. The branch selected the Fu Baoshan mutual aid group as a "typical demonstration." This group is the model group in the village. The group members are either party members or league members, or activists. Branch secretary Sun Jingyun is also in this group. With the personal help of the cadres, the Fu Baoshan group, after deliberation, discussion, and party members taking the lead, the work progressed very smoothly, and a production increase plan of 18 shi of grain per hectare was made. After researching, the branch and the County Committee's work team believed that this was a "successful experience" and promoted it in the three mutual aid groups with a better foundation. Branch Secretary Sun Jingyun personally helped revise the patriotic production increase plan in the Li Gui mutual aid group. After he made clear the significance of patriotic Fengchan, he called on everyone to learn from the Fu Baoshan group. But the members of the Li Gui mutual aid group didn't say they would learn, nor did they say they wouldn't learn. They just looked at me, I looked at you, and no one said anything. Finally, Yuan Jingshan, an activist arranged by the branch secretary in advance, took the "model role" and stuttered: "I plan to plant half a hectare of millet, harvest eight shi and five, and one hectare of sorghum will harvest fourteen shi..." Before he finished speaking, the group members started arguing. Li Huanzhang said: "How can your land yield so much grain? You're just making it up!" Someone said: "Blowing the horn doesn't cost anything. The bigger the horn, the better!" Others sarcastically said: "Measuring with eggshells might get you that many shi." The meeting broke up, and everyone was talking at once. The branch secretary was anxious and gave the masses' "conservative thinking" a big "blast" before he could suppress the chaos. It took half the night to barely make the plan.

	Other groups were even more difficult -- anyway, the production increase plan was revised and improved. All twenty-three mutual aid groups in the village successively made production increase plans of 15 or 16 shi per hectare. Based on the plans of each group, the branch made a production increase plan of an average of sixteen shi and four dou per hectare for the entire village.

	As soon as the plan was announced, gossip spread; the cadres walked in front, and people said behind them: "The cadres have big mouths. Whatever they say is what it is." Because the cadres insisted on the masses making the plans higher, it caused a lot of people to suspect. Some people were afraid that the government would levy public grain according to this production increase plan in the autumn, so they complained: "The cadres just want to make a good name for themselves in front of their superiors and give gifts with our old folks!" More farmers believe in the government's policies and don't worry about paying more public grain, but they don't believe they can harvest so much grain. They often angrily say: "If we can't harvest this much grain in the autumn, the cadres have to guarantee it."

	With the plan made, the rising production enthusiasm fell instead. Originally, there were many people who delivered manure and transported soil to prepare the land; now, none can be seen. The branch members were very worried. They called a mass meeting for propaganda, but the masses didn't even come to the meeting. People say: "Anyway, it's that
	set, spring plowing, summer hoeing, autumn harvesting, and paying public grain in winter. What's the point of listening?"

	The best working village in the county is still like this, not to mention other villages. The patriotic Fengchan movement in Zhaoyuan County was resisted like this.

	Where is the key?

	This situation was quickly reflected to the County Committee, to County Committee Secretary Ren Guodong. The report from the District Committee said: "The masses have strong conservative ideas, and there are great difficulties in revising the production increase plan." The county cadres who went to various districts to check on the work reported: "The work style of district and village cadres is generally standardized, the farmers have conservative ideas, and there is no significant achievement in the work of revising the production increase plan."

	The County Committee held a special meeting to study this issue.

	"Are the farmers willing to harvest more grain? Of course, they are. But why do the farmers oppose raising the production increase plan?" Comrade Ren Guodong analyzed: "They don't know how to increase the production of so much grain!"

	"The cadres' work style is standardized, and the farmers have conservative ideas. This is a fact. But why is the cadres' work generally standardized, and why do the farmers have conservative ideas?" Comrade Ren Guodong concluded at the end of the meeting: "It is because they don't know how to increase the production of more grain, they don't know how to lead production. The key issue is to give the farmers a way to increase production, and give the cadres a way to lead production."

	The problem was raised, but how to solve it?

	Comrade Ren Guodong was troubled by this for many days -- more than many days, he had been thinking about solving this problem for a long time.

	As early as the autumn of 1951, a farmer named Fang Chunzhi in this county created a record of producing more than 30 shi of millet per hectare. Ren Guodong immediately sent agricultural technician Shi Fengming to investigate and study this experience in order to promote it throughout the county. However, Shi Fengming's investigation report said: Fang Chunzhi's Fengchan experience is: First, more hoeing and weeding; Second, more fertilizer... -- These "experiences" were all conclusions that the higher authorities had drawn three years ago. Now they are being regarded as "experiences" and returning to the old path. But can we blame Shi Fengming? He has been a model cadre in the county for three or four years. He works hard, is not afraid of hardship, and insists on working even when he is sick. It's just that he has been participating in the revolution for a short time, lacks work experience, and has few working methods -- this is not his fault, it is the responsibility of the leaders. At that time, Ren Guodong wanted to continue to solve this problem, but "Party rectification," "Three-Anti," and "grain purchase" successively brought many new tasks. He was too busy, and it passed by. Now, the matter can no longer be unsolved; but how to solve it? Tell the farmers how to increase production, and give the cadres a way to lead production, but where is this method? What is it?

	"I don't have these myself," Comrade Ren Guodong recalled the situation at the beginning of the spring plowing: "My best method is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions: go to the masses."

	"Lost 118,000 horses"

	In order to solve the key problem in the patriotic Fengchan movement -- to give farmers a way to increase production, and to give cadres a way to lead production, on April 20th, the members of the Zhaoyuan County Committee, according to their pre-arranged division of labor, went to various districts and villages to check on the spring plowing work.

	Comrade Ren Guodong went to Sihetun in the Seventh District.

	Sihetun is the hometown of Wang Zhentang, a famous national agricultural labor model. Agricultural production has developed greatly in recent years. In 1952, under the leadership of Wang Zhentang, an agricultural production cooperative including all the farmers in the village was established.

	"You're here, we're in trouble." As soon as Comrade Ren Guodong arrived in Sihetun, branch secretary Yu Changjiang said to him with relief. Afterwards, he apologetically introduced the situation in the village: "The cadres of the cooperative have drafted a plan to produce eight shi and three per hectare, but they have not announced it to the members because they are afraid that the masses will object."

	"Do you have the confidence to implement this plan yourselves?"

	"I heard that Fang Chunzhi harvested more than 30 shi of millet per hectare last year." Yu Changjiang avoided directly answering the question raised by Ren Guodong: "How did he do it?"

	The two were embarrassed -- now, Ren Guodong recalled the scene at that time and said: "At that time, I was really anxious. The question raised by Yu Changjiang was the question raised by all the farmers to the leaders. But, we couldn't come up with a solution."

	Ren Guodong and branch secretary Yu Changjiang sat face-to-face in Yu Changjiang's house for a long time. The two smoked one cigarette after another, making the whole room smoky. In order to focus on thinking about this problem, Ren Guodong leaned back on a pile of quilts and stared aimlessly at the roof. At this time, a large string of corn cobs hanging on the beam caught his eye and aroused his attention. Ren Guodong watched the corn cobs, large and small, crowded together, and his thoughts ran to the fields. What was waving in front of his eyes was no longer the corn cobs, large and small, hanging on the beam, but the endless, tall and short, thick and thin crops.

	Ren Guodong is very familiar with planting crops. Every time he goes to the countryside to check on the work, he always goes to the fields to look at the crops. Even when he stays in the County Committee to take care of the work of the county, he always runs to the county demonstration farm to take a look after dinner every day. He often talks with farm workers and rural farmers, and sometimes participates in their labor. He often asks the technicians of the farm for advice, and he also often chats with experienced farmers. Therefore, he not only knows how the farmers cultivate their land, but also knows a lot of new agricultural scientific knowledge. Now, looking at the corn cobs, large and small, on the beam, he thought of a problem that had been revolving in his mind a year ago. At that time, he went to the county farm to play, and accidentally saw an unusually large corn cob, and thought: "If they all grew so tall and so well, how much grain would be harvested!"

	"How many corn plants are planted on one hectare?" Ren Guodong asked Yu Changjiang.

	"Planting land is a rough job," Yu Changjiang replied, "Who counts how many plants there are?"

	"Well, this is very important," Ren Guodong said, "Let's count."

	The two began to count the number of plants. Yu Changjiang gestured the distance of the plants on the kang, and Ren Guodong calculated. The result of the calculation was that there were three corn plants every five chi, and a total of 27,000 plants per hectare; there were 100 millet plants every five chi, and 900,000 plants per hectare; there were eight sorghum plants every five chi, and 72,000 plants per hectare. Soybeans…. After the calculation, Ren Guodong asked Yu Changjiang to find a scale: "Let's weigh this corn cob to see how much it weighs."

	"My corn didn't grow well last year." After Yu Changjiang brought the scale, he said while picking corn cobs on the beam: "It can't represent the corn of our Sihetun." He only picked the large ones.

	"Don't pick the big ones," Ren Guodong stopped him, "Pick the average ones."

	After picking them, the two began to strip the corn kernels, and Ren Guodong asked:

	"Can we make all the corn cobs grow this big?"

	"Secretary Ren is just joking." Yu Changjiang laughed. He measured the corn cob, which was less than five inches, with his hand and said disapprovingly: "If we can't make it grow this big, how can we call ourselves farmers?"

	After weighing the corn kernels, that corn cob weighed three liang (the northeast jin is a decimal system, each jin is divided into ten liang. One liang equals 1.6 city liang). A calculation showed that one hectare equals 10,800 jin. This number surprised both of them. Yu Changjiang shouted that the calculation was wrong. "Absolutely not," Yu Changjiang said categorically, "I only harvested more than 2,000 jin last year. You calculated more than 10,000 jin -- where did those 8,000 jin go? Absolutely not." Ren Guodong didn't expect to produce so much, so he recalculated. The result was still 10,800 jin. "Then the number of mu of land must be wrong." Yu Changjiang insisted: "One hectare is not 9,000 square bows [Note 3], but 7,200." So he returned to calculating the bow openings. In the North Manchuria region, the land is vast and the population is sparse, and the land is planted roughly. High ridge operations with large ridge ditches are implemented. Generally, a ridge is two chi wide, and a few are one chi eight and two chi five. According to the ridge calculation of two chi, one hectare is 9,000 square bows. One bow is three plants, and one hectare is exactly 27,000 plants; an average of three corn plants grows four cobs, which can harvest 10,800 jin without any difference. They used the same method to weigh millet, sorghum, and soybeans, and it was the same. One hectare of millet can harvest 27,000 jin, sorghum 14,000 jin, and soybeans 9,000 jin. All are two or three times higher than the past yield. This confused Yu Changjiang, and he kept wondering: "How is this done? How is this done?"

	This discovery gave Comrade Ren Guodong a lot of inspiration. The door to Fengchan has been found by him. He said to Yu Changjiang:

	"Your crops were not good last year, and we weighed the average cob, which shows that this is the normal annual yield of the land." He sorted out his thoughts:

	"If we plant the crops better, the yield will be higher. Now we have not reached the normal annual yield. This proves that our land has great potential for increasing production."

	"Now, we only harvest four or five shi of grain per hectare," Yu Changjiang said heavily, "According to the calculation just now, whether it's millet or corn, it should be harvested more than 20 shi. Secretary Ren, we lose the money of one horse per hectare per year." He said regretfully: "My family has ten hectares of land, and we lose ten horses!"

	"Your family loses ten horses, how many horses does our county of 118,000 hectares of land lose!" Ren Guodong said with even more regret than Yu Changjiang:

	"One hundred and eighteen thousand."

	"But how is this lost?" Yu Changjiang asked in surprise.

	"What else can be lost in our new China? Now that we know it's lost, we can find it back." Ren Guodong said with confidence: "Let's have a meeting of cadres and bring in the cadres from the four nearby villages. With more people, there will be more ideas, and we will surely help us find the horses back."

	"Zhuge Liang Meeting"

	The next night, the cadres of five villages held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" in Sihetun. Ren Guodong first told everyone the process and results of his research with Yu Changjiang, and then brought the ears of various crops to weigh in person. The village cadres were as excited as Yu Changjiang yesterday, and everyone was talking about it. Hu Qinggui, secretary of the Fenggang Village Branch, said:

	"I've been planting crops for a lifetime, and I've never calculated this big account." Yu Wanyou, the village chief of Yong'an Village, said: "Secretary Ren has opened up the thousand-year-old gourd."

	"One hectare loses the money of one horse." Yu Changjiang talked about his horse again: "My family has ten hectares of land and loses ten horses a year!"

	"Everyone, look for it," Ren Guodong raised the question, "Where are the horses lost?"

	Farmers have experience in planting crops. When it comes to the reasons for harvesting less grain, everyone can say several.

	"In my opinion, lack of seedlings is a big deal." Li Rongfu, secretary of the Kaoshantun Branch, said: "Standing at the head of the field, it looks like it's full of seedlings. But if you walk into the field, you'll know. There are broken rows everywhere, and there are many places where you can't see seedlings for two or three chi."

	The meeting was held in the form of chatting and gossiping. When one person mentioned the lack of seedlings, everyone started talking about this. Many people described the degree of lack of seedlings based on the situation in their own fields. According to the situation reflected by everyone, no matter sorghum, millet, soybeans, or corn, if calculated according to the number of plants just now, the lack of seedlings is between one-third and one-half.

	"Just in the item of lack of seedlings, we lose half a horse per hectare." Ren Guodong said. But he was especially happy because he discovered it. "Why are there so many missing seedlings?"

	There are many reasons for the lack of seedlings. You say one thing and I say another. There are more than a dozen reasons. For example: poor seed selection -- there are blind seeds; most seeds are not disinfected -- they have been attacked by insects and diseases; when sowing, they are looking around, spreading the seeds incorrectly, and the soil is not compacted -- there are broken rows; in addition, wild sparrows eat seeds, big-eyed thieves eat seedlings, hoeing and weeding carelessly... are all reasons for the lack of seedlings. People said: "If you want to find this half a horse back, you have to have full seedlings;"

	"To have full seedlings, you have to get rid of the reasons for the lack of seedlings."

	"Let me say another opinion. Lack of seedlings means less grain. Too many seedlings crowded together also means less grain." The branch secretary of Yimianpo Village said: "Take my millet as an example. There is no seedling for three chi or two chi where there are missing seedlings. Where there are no missing seedlings, they are like horse manes, densely packed together. In the autumn, many crops can't grow ears. Even if they grow an ear, it's not as big as a little fingertip. Where can you get grain?"

	"This opinion is correct." Several people agreed. Ma Jingchun of Sihetun especially agreed with this opinion. He said: "It's like people eating. If a thousand people are crowded in this room where we are meeting, let alone eating, they would be squeezed to death." His interesting metaphor made everyone laugh. However, Ma Jingchun, who had hoeed for landlords for twenty years and is now a technician of the Sihetun Agricultural Production Cooperative, did not laugh at all. Instead, he said seriously: "Crops are like people, crowded together like horse manes. If they don't have land, they don't have manure fertilizer. How can they grow up?"

	"Very right," Ren Guodong couldn't help but interject: "This opinion is very important."

	"If you want to harvest more grain, you have to make the seedlings even." Under Ren Guodong's praise, Ma Jingchun became even more excited and happily said: "Secretary Ren must have been born as a farmer. He knows what he's doing."

	Secretary Ren was really born as a farmer. His home is in Shanxi. Planting crops in Shanxi is different from the northeast. The crops in Shanxi are closely spaced and carefully tended. They are hoeed and thinned, and the crops grow evenly. He often compares the situation of planting crops in his hometown with the northeast. Every time he compares, he feels that the way of planting crops in the northeast wastes a lot of land. "How wide is the ridge suitable?" In order to solve this problem, he didn't know how many times he had looked at the fields. He studied how big the roots of various crops are. He saw that the roots of sorghum and corn only occupied a half-foot square of land, and the roots of other crops occupied even less space. So at this meeting, he asked the village cadres to consider whether they could also narrow the row spacing to six or seven inches like in Guanli, "Even if it's narrowed to one chi, we would harvest twice as much grain."

	However, the cadres did not agree with his opinion. Everyone said that if the ridges were changed, all the farm tools would have to be replaced, and they didn't have that much financial resources; besides, Guyu had already passed, and there was no time. Although this opinion was not passed, the issue of wasting land aroused the attention of all the village cadres.

	"The ridge ditch is two chi wide, but the seedling hole is only two cun wide." The cadres said.

	"Yes!" Ren Guodong quickly seized this opinion: "We only used one-tenth of the land. Ten mu of land only has one mu planted." Everything is afraid of analysis, and problems are discovered once they are exposed. Ren Guodong's opinion aroused the attention of all the cadres. "It's not okay to narrow the ridge ditch." Ren Guodong said, "What do you think about widening the seedling hole?"

	"This method works." Everyone said.

	"This method is great," Hu Qinggui, secretary of the Fenggang Village Branch, also said: "The land doesn't not produce grain. People just don't want it to produce grain."

	The opinion of widening the sowing width was quickly accepted by everyone. Everyone also studied how wide the seedling hole should be for what crops, and how to keep "corner seedlings" to ensure that the crops have enough land, manure fertilizer, sunlight, and air.

	The meeting continued until late at night. But people's enthusiasm became stronger and stronger, and their speeches became more and more enthusiastic.

	"If you want to harvest more grain, you have to have full seedlings, even seedlings, make higher use of the land, and widen the seedling width." At the end of the meeting, Ren Guodong summarized everyone's opinions and said: "Among these, equal distance is the most important. As long as you really achieve equal distance, the seedlings will be full and even. To put it simply, it is equal-distance wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection."

	"Good, this method is good." Wang Zhentang, a national agricultural labor model who spoke very little throughout the meeting and thought hard, said: "We will immediately conduct propaganda to the masses and implement it."

	"If we can also apply fertilizer reasonably in stages," Ren Guodong continued: "We will get a higher yield."

	The new cultivation method of "equal-distance wide sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and staged fertilization" was thus produced. Because it came from the masses, it concentrated the masses' experience and wisdom, and it was a cultivation method that could be implemented without spending more money, adding new farm tools, or using more cadres, so the masses easily accepted it. The afternoon of the day after the meeting, Li Rongfu, the branch secretary of Kaoshantun Village, ran to Sihetun to report to Ren Guodong: "The masses are very enthusiastic and are revising the plan." The Wang Zhentang Agricultural Production Cooperative also held a meeting of members and announced the plan that they did not dare to announce to the members; the members

    丰产县和金星奖章
    肇源县〔注一〕的农民，在去年夏天以前，总愿意谈论一九五○年的收成。“那年要风来风，缺水落雨，真是风调雨顺。”农民们说：“简直没见过那样的好收成，每垧地收获四石九斗〔注二〕。记事以来，没经过打这么多粮食。”可是，现在，肇源县的农民却说：“一九五○年算啥，这才叫收成呢，粮食都没处盛了。”一九五二年，肇源县得到了空前的丰收。全部土地的平均产量，是每垧七石五斗。“话又说回来了。”农民们惋惜地说：“要是碰上一九五○年那样雨水调和的年头，别说七石五，怕十石也不饶它呢！”
    一九五二年肇源县的庄稼，遭了很多折磨，农业生产是在七灾八难的情况下进行的。春天闹风灾，八千多垧地有的被砂子盖起多厚，种子出不来；有的出苗了，又被大风摔死在地上。夏天，苗子正需要水分的时候，来了个全县大酷旱。轻的地方二、三十天不下雨，重的地方连旱五十七天。许多庄稼都旱坏了。一阵小风，也能把干枯了的叶子，吹得簌簌地落下来。初秋，眼看庄稼就要到家了，一场倾盆大雨，松花江水溢出河堤，庄稼又遭了水灾。地里积满了水，高粱地里能捉到一、二斤的大鱼。一万四千垧地不用说打粮食，连秸秆也没回家。有更多的土地，都不同程度地减产了。
    但是，一九五二年肇源丰收了，空前地丰收了。如果除去一万四千垧颗粒未收的土地，全县收获面积是九万三千七百零一垧。每垧产粮三千四百三十六点五斤。大大地超过了丰产的一九五○年。比一九五一年竟增产百分之九十二点九，差不多快增产一倍了。因此，中央人民政府农业部特授予它“丰产县”的光荣称号。
    这是怎样获得的呢？
    中国共产党肇源县委员会书记任国栋同志创造了适合本地情况的耕作方法。就是因为这个耕作方法，使肇源县获得了空前的大丰收。得到了“丰产县”的光荣称号。任国栋同志也成为“爱国丰产模范工作者”，得到了中央人民政府农业部颁发的爱国丰产金星奖章。
    任国栋同志怎样创造了这个耕作法？为什么别的地方不能创造出来，他能创造出来？这位县委书记是怎样工作的呢？
    他这样对待党的任务
    一九五二年十二月，一个冰冻的日子里，我去访问任国栋同志。我到县委会时，他正和宣传部长谈论一九五三年的爱国丰产运动问题。
    “就拿永发村农民李景春说吧，”他继续他的谈话：“一九五二年，他创造了一垧地收三十一石的纪录。一九五三年他能保持这个产量吗？能再提高些吗？”
    任国栋说话的姿态，像他在屋里来回踱步一样的缓慢、平静，好像随时都准备停下来，倾听别人的意见。而且他真的停下来，倾听宣传部长的意见了。我想起几天前在省城时，中共黑龙江省委给我介绍情况时对他的评语：任国栋同志工作踏实、深入，善于发现问题、钻研问题……。
    “不一定？对啦，问题就在这里。”他同意宣传部长的意见：“我们的责任就是要它一定。”任国栋同志特别加重“一定”两个字：“一定要使高产量的继续提高，低产量的迅速赶上去。这是一九五三年我们领导农业生产的基本任务。”
    当广大农民正在欢庆丰收，以从未有过的热情投入冬季生产，以最大的兴奋和决心准备来年实行新耕作法时；当东北各省农民、干部，成百成千地来肇源县学习新耕作法，参观丰产县的工作的时候；当各地报纸上一次又一次宣传、表扬肇源县在农业生产战线上这一伟大胜利的时候，任国栋同志已经处心积虑地筹划着一九五三年的生产了。
    “他就是这样。”事后，宣传部长石凯令同志向我说：“干部们被工作困难苦恼着的时候，他总是笑嘻嘻地说：这也是有利条件、那也是有利条件；干部们都觉得对工作满有把握、满有信心的时候，他又提出：会遇到这个阻碍、那个困难，使人一点也不敢大意，一时也不敢松劲。”
    一九五二年春耕开始的情况就是这样的。
    四月十日，附近各县的许多农村中，还静悄悄的没有动静，肇源县的春耕工作已经进行得很热闹了；春麦播种工作已经完成；大田的粪肥已经送到地里；在党对农民进行新旧道路教育的基础上，全县互助合作运动迅速地发展起来。规模上空前扩大，质量上日益提高，还出现了三个农业生产合作社。高岗同志“每垧增产五斗粮食”的号召，已经订在每个村庄、每个互助组的爱国增产计划上——各种工作都在顺利进行中，甚至可以说是“胜利开展中”。
    可是，这时候的任国栋同志，却在钻研一个问题，而且思索好久了。
    一天夜里，天气已经很晚，任国栋同志还在房子里来回踱着——这是他的习惯，脑筋里有个问题解决不了时，他常常这样走呀走的沉思默想。他的爱人——县委组织部干事赵锋同志实在忍不住了，第五次催他休息。他停下来，突如其来地问道：“怎样才算完成党的任务呢？”
    “就是实现党的要求呗！”赵锋同志确切、明朗地回答：“比方党号召每垧地增产五斗粮食，到秋天真多打了五斗，就是完成了党的任务呗。”
    “正是我们这样对待党的任务，才使我们的工作总是这般平静地进行着。”任国栋同志说：“如果高岗同志号召增产三斗，我们的增产计划会不会一律订三斗？要是他号召八斗，情形又怎样？”
    赵锋同志没有回答，可是心里却承认道：“那也准是三斗、八斗。”
    “可见有时实现了党的要求，并不是真正完成了党的任务。”任国栋同志把“有时”“真正”四个字强调到使赵锋惊讶的程度，并继续说下去：“把工作作到我们能够作到的最好程度，才是真正完成党的任务。”
    几天后，任国栋同志把这个问题，向区委书记联席会提出来。他说一九五○年肇源县的农业生产，已经超过解放前的水平。恢复阶段已经过去，今后是发展了。“恢复还有个过去的标准，发展就是另外一回事了，谁也不能给我们订下个标准。”他说：
    “高岗同志的号召是把土壤坏、工作基础较弱的地区包括在内的。我们不是这样的地区。我们的增产任务不应该是五斗，而是一石、两石，也许还要更多。”
    会议结束时，区委书记们同意任国栋同志的意见：重新修订和提高爱国增产计划，争取更大的丰收。
    就这样顶住了
    孟克里村是全县工作最好的村庄。党的基础强，群众觉悟高，全村农民都参加了互助组。在全县有名的模范党员、模范干部—支部书记孙景云同志领导下，历年来工作作的好，好几次被选为全县的模范村。因此，县委把它选为重点村，派了一个工作组，专门帮助和领导孟克里村的丰产运动。
    为了把孟克里村的丰产运动作出个样子，推动全县的爱国丰产运动，村支部在工作组的帮助下，向群众进行了一系列的宣传教育工作。三月末，全村农民对爱国增产与国家建设的关系、爱国丰产与改善自己生活的关系，以及农村经济发展方向等等问题，都有了比较清楚的了解，可以说已经作到“深入人心，家喻户晓”了。群众的生产情绪很高。根据这种情况，支部便把自己的工作，转入具体的组织工作—领导群众订爱国增产计划。
    问题就出在订增产计划上了。
    各组订的计划，都比一九五一年增产五、六斗。可是一九五一年是歉收年，全县平均每垧地只收四石多一点。孟克里村工作好，每垧也只收了六石二斗。加上增产的五、六斗。还赶不上一九五○年本村每垧八石四斗的平均产量。
    这样个好村庄都这样，全县的丰产运动怎么能搞得好呢？县委工作组和支部遵照县委的指示，再次动员群众提高增产计划、修改增产计划。
    “计划好订，能实现才算啦！”上年岁的老年农民说：“种在地上，收在天上。老天爷不下雨，订的计划再高也白搭。”更多的农民则说：“咱村这地，收个六、七石顶折腰啦。”因为支部领导重新修订计划的工作作得急了一些，使得一些人从根本上怀疑起订计划这回事了。他们说：“指儿不养娘，指地不打粮，计算出来的孩子不好养活。”——支部一看不对头，立刻改变工作方法：用本村的事实向群众宣传增产的可能性。一九五一年，本村农民陆廷斌、孙景山的谷子和高粱，一垧地都收了十七石。支部就宣传他们的事。可是群众听了以后，却说道：
    “咱村这么多人家，只他三、二家，不知怎么碰上啦！”
    “要不，就是他们的土地亩数大，两垧说一垧。”
    支部便说，不是他们的土地亩数大，更不是运气好，是人家的地养种得细致。群众一听更烦了。说：“三年前你们就深耕细作呀，多铲多?呀，多上粪呀！也不嫌絮烦地慌。咱村谁家不是这样作的？怎么没打这些粮食？”
    各种工作都作到啦，还是不能提高增产计划。支部和工作组共同开了好几次会，检查自己的工作，研究改进的办法。讨论的结果，决定先“突破一点”，再推动全村修订增产计划的工作。支部选择傅宝山互助组作“典型示范”。这个组是村里的模范组。组员们不是党员和团员，就是积极分子，支部书记孙景云也在这个组里。在干部们亲自帮助下，傅宝山组经过酝酿、讨论、党员带头，果然工作进行得很顺利，订出了每垧产粮十八石的增产计划。支部和县委工作组研究后，认为这是个“成功的经验”，便在三个基础较好的互助组里推广。支部书记孙景云同志亲自在李贵互助组里帮助修订爱国增产计划。他讲清楚爱国丰产的意义后，便号召大家向傅宝山组学习。但李贵互助组组员们不说学习，也不说不学习，只是你看看我，我瞅瞅你，谁也不吱声。最后，支部书记事先布置好的积极分子袁景山起“模范作用”，硬着头皮吭吭吃吃地说：“我计划种半垧谷子，打八石五，一垧高粱收十四石……”还没等他说完，组员们就吵吵起来了。李焕章说：“你那地多昝打过这么多粮食？净蒙天海地地瞎说！”有人说：“吹牛不下本钱，越往大里吹越带劲！”还有的讽刺道：“用鸡蛋壳量，许能打那么多石（蛋），”会议算乱了，七嘴八舌，说什么的都有。支部书记急啦，把群众的“保守思想”，大大地“吹”了一顿，才算把这个乱劲压下去。整整闹了半宿，才勉强把计划订出来。
    别的组比这还难——不管怎么样吧，反正增产计划是修订了、提高了。全村二十三个互助组，都先后订出每垧十五、六石的增产计划。支部根据各组计划，订出全村每垧平均十六石四斗的增产计划。
    计划刚公布，闲话就传出来了；干部在前面走，人们在后面说：“干部嘴大，说啥是啥。”因为干部们硬要群众往高里订计划，引起了不少人的猜疑。有人害怕到秋后政府就按着这个增产计划征公粮，便埋怨说：“干部光图在上级面前落好名誉，拿咱老百姓送礼！”更多的农民是相信政府的政策的，倒不耽心会多缴公粮，可是他们不相信能收这么多粮食。常常气愤地说：“秋后打不了这些粮食，要干部包出来。”
    这一订计划，高涨着的生产情绪，反倒低落下去了。本来，送粪运土整地的挺多；现在，一个也看不见了。支部委员们都很着急。召集群众大会进行宣传，但群众连开会也不来了。人们说：“反正是那
    一套，春耕夏锄秋收割，到了冬天缴公粮，有啥听头。”
    全县工作最好的村庄尚且如此，其他的村庄更是这样啦。肇源县的爱国丰产运动就这样顶住了。
    关键在哪里
    这种情况，很快就反映到县委会，反映到县委书记任国栋同志面前了。区委会来的报告说：“群众有浓厚的保守思想，修订增产计划遇到很大困难。”到各区检查工作的县干部则报告说：“区、村干部工作作风一般化，农民有保守思想，修订增产计划工作，无显著成绩。”
    县委会举行专门会议，研究这个问题。
    “农民愿不愿意多打粮食？当然愿意。可是农民为什么反对提高增产计划呢？”任国栋同志分析道：“不知道怎样才能增产那么多粮食啊！”
    “干部作风一般化，农民有保守思想，这是事实。可是干部为什么工作一般化，农民为什么有保守思想呢？”任国栋同志在会议结束时这样作结论：“是他们不知道怎样才能增产更多的粮食，不知怎样领导生产呀。关键问题是给农民增产的办法，给干部领导生产的方法。”
    问题是提出来了，但怎样解决呢？
    为这件事，任国栋同志为难了好多天——岂止好多天，很久以前，他就想解决这个问题了。
    还在一九五一年秋天，本县农民方纯志，创造了
    一垧谷子产三十多石的纪录。任国栋当时就派了农业技术员石凤鸣去调查、研究这个经验，以便在全县推广。可是，石凤鸣的调查报告说：方纯志的丰产经验是：一、铲?多；二、上粪多；……。——这些“经验”，都是三年前上级早已提出来的结论，现在又把它当作“经验”，回到老路上去了。但，这能怪石凤鸣吗？他三、四年来就是县的模范干部，工作努力，不怕吃苦，有病还坚持工作。只是因为参加革命时间短，缺乏工作经验，工作方法少——这不是他的过错，是领导者的责任啊。当时，任国栋曾想继续解决这个问题，可是“整党”、
    “三反”、“购粮”，接二连三地来了许多新任务，一忙，就忙过去了。现在，事情再也不能不解决了；可是怎样解决呢？告诉农民提高产量的方法，给干部领导生产的方法，但这方法在哪里呢？是什么呢？
    “我自己没有这些，”任国栋同志回忆起春耕开始时期的情形说：“我的最好方法是遵照毛主席的指示：到群众中去。”
    “丢掉了十一万八千匹马”
    为着解决爱国丰产运动中这个关键问题——给农民提高生产的办法，给干部领导生产的办法，四月二十日，肇源县委们按照事先的分工，分头到各区、村检查春耕工作。
    任国栋同志到七区四合屯去。
    四合屯是全国著名农业劳动模范王振堂的家乡。几年来农业生产有很大的发展。一九五二年，在王振堂的领导下，又成立起包括全屯农民的农业生产合作社。
    “你可来啦，我们正为难呢。”任国栋同志刚到四合屯，支部书记于长江便如释重负地向他说。随后，又抱歉似地介绍村里的情况道：“合作社的干部已经拟出一个每垧产粮八石三的计划，因为怕群众反对，还没有向社员公布。”
    “你们自己对这个计划有信心实现么？”
    “听说去年方纯志一垧谷子打三十多石，”于长江回避着正面回答任国栋提出的问题：“他是怎么整的呢？”
    两个人窘住了—现在，任国栋回忆起当时的情景时说：“那时我真着急，于长江提出的问题，就是全体农民向领导上提出的问题。可是，我们却拿不出办法来。”
    任国栋和支部书记于长江，面对面地在于长江家闷坐了好久。两个人一对一根地吸烟，把满屋子都闹得烟气腾腾的。任国栋为了集中地思考一下这个问题，便把身子仰靠在一罗被子上，两眼无目的地望着房顶。这时，挂在房梁上的一大串一大串的玉茭穗映入他的眼帘，引起他的注意。任国栋注视着那大大小小的、挤在一起的玉茭穗，思想跑到地里去了。在他眼前幌动着的，已经不是挂在房梁上大大小小的玉茭穗，而是无边无际高高矮矮、粗粗细细的庄稼了。
    任国栋对种庄稼的事是很熟悉的。每次下乡检查工作，他总要到田里看看庄稼。就是他留在县委会照顾全县工作的时候，每天晚饭后，也总要跑到县示范农场去看看。他常和农场工人、农村农民谈话，有时也参加他们的劳动。他常向农场的技术员请教，也常和有经验的农民攀谈。因此，他不仅知道农民怎样耕种他们的土地，也知道不少新的农业科学知识。现在，他看着房梁上这大大小小的玉茭穗，他又想起一年前就在脑筋里回转着的一个问题了。那时，他到县农场去玩，偶然看见一个大得出奇的玉茭，便想道：“要是都长得这样高、这样好，该收多少粮食啊！”
    “一垧地种多少棵玉茭呢？”任国栋问于长江。
    “种地是粗拉活，”于长江回答：“谁还数它多少棵呢。”
    “嗯，这很重要，”任国栋说：“来咱们算算。”
    两个人算起庄稼棵数来了。于长江用手在炕上比划庄稼的距离，任国栋算。算的结果，玉茭是每五尺有三棵，一垧共二万七千棵；谷子是每五尺一百棵，一垧九十万棵；高粱每五尺有八棵，一垧七万
    二千棵。大豆……。算完后，任国栋让于长江去找
    一个秤来：“咱们秤秤这玉茭穗，看一穗有多重。”
    “去年我的玉茭长的不好。”于长江拿来秤以后，一面摘房梁上的玉茭穗，一面说：“不能代表我们四合屯的玉茭。”说着，净捡大的摘。
    “别摘大的，”任国栋制止他：“捡那中流的。”
    摘下后，两个人就往下退起玉茭粒来，任国栋问道：
    “能叫玉茭穗都长这么大吗？”
    “任书记净开玩笑。”于长江笑起来，他用手量着那个不满五寸的玉茭穗，不以为然地说：“不能让它长这么点儿大，还叫庄稼人？”
    秤过玉茭粒后，那棵玉茭是三两重（东北的斤是十进位，每斤分十两。一两合一·六市两。）一计算，一垧地合一万零八百斤。这个数目，使两个人都大吃一惊。于长江吵吵着说算错了。“万不能，”于长江斩钉截铁地说：“去年我只收了二千多斤，你算的是一万多斤——那八千斤跑到那儿去了？万不能。”任国栋也没想到能产这么多，于是又重新算。结果还是一万零八百斤。“那就是地的亩数算错了。”于长江坚持说：“一垧地不是九千方弓〔注三〕，是七千二。”于是又返回来算弓口。北满地区地广人稀，地种的粗糙，都是实行大垅沟的高垅作业。一般是二尺宽一垅，也有少数是一尺八和二尺五的。按二尺的垅计算，一垧就是九千方弓。一弓三棵，
    一垧整整二万七千棵；平均三棵玉茭长四个穗，恰恰能收一万零八百斤，一点不差。他们又用同样的方法，秤过谷子、高粱和大豆，也是如此。谷子一垧能收二万七千斤，高粱一万四千斤，大豆九千斤。都比过去的产量高两、三倍。这下可把于长江闹蒙了，一个劲纳闷地问：“这是咋整的呢？这是咋整的呢？”
    这个发现，给了任国栋同志很大的启发。通往丰产的大门，已经被他找到了。他向于长江说道：
    “你去年的庄稼不算好，咱们秤的又是中流穗，可见这才是土地的常年产量。”他整理着自己的思想：
    “如果我们把庄稼种的再好点，产量会更高。现在我们还没有达到常年产量。这证明我们的土地有极大的增产的可能性。”
    “现在，我们一垧地才收四、五石粮，”于长江沉重地说：“刚才算的，不论谷子、玉茭，都该收二十多石。任书记，一垧地一年就丢一匹马钱哪。”他惋惜地说：“我家十来垧地，就失掉了十匹马呀！”
    “你一家十匹，咱县十一万八千垧土地，要丢掉多少匹马呢！”任国栋比于长江更加惋惜地说：
    “十一万八千匹。”
     “可是，这是怎么丢的呢？”于长江惊讶地追问着。
    “在咱新中国还能丢掉什么东西么？既然知道丢掉了，我们就能把它找回来。”任国栋满怀信心地说：“我们开个干部会吧，把附近四个村的干部也找来。人多主意多，准能帮助咱们把马找回来。”
    “诸葛亮会”
    第二天夜晚，五个村的干部，便在四合屯举行了“诸葛亮会”。任国栋先把他同于长江研究的经过和结果告诉大家，再拿来各种庄稼的穗头，当面秤分量。村干部们都像昨天的于长江一样的兴奋起来了，大家议论纷纷。凤岗村支部书记胡庆贵说：
    “种一辈子庄稼了，没算过这个大账。”永安村村长于万有说：“千年的闷葫芦任书记给揭开了。”
    “一垧地就损失一匹马钱。”于长江又说他的马啦：“我家十来垧地，一年就丢掉十匹马呀！”
    “大家找找看，”任国栋提出问题：“马丢在哪里了？”
    种庄稼，农民是有经验的。谈到少收粮食的原因，谁都能说出好几条。
    “依我看缺苗就是个大事情。”靠山屯支部书记李荣福说：“站在地头上一看，青堂堂的满苗。可是到地里面走一趟就知道了。到处是断条拉格子，三、二尺远不见苗的地方多着咧。”
    会议是用拉家常、“唠闲喀”的形式举行的。一人说起缺苗，大家都朝这方面唠开了。好些人都根据自家田里的情形，说出缺苗的程度。按大家反映的情况，不论高粱、谷子，不论大豆、玉茭，若按刚才计算的棵数算，缺苗都在三分之一到二分之一。
    “光在缺苗这一项上，我们一垧地就损失了半匹马。”任国栋说。但是，因为发现了它，又特别高兴。“为什么会缺这么多苗哇？”
    缺苗的原因多啦，你一言我一语，一凑就是十几条。比方：选种不好—有瞎籽；大多数种子没消毒—遭了虫灾病害；播种时东张西望，撒籽不正，轧土不实—有断条；另外如野雀吃种子，大眼贼吃幼苗，铲?地时不小心……都是造成缺苗的原因。人们说：“要想把这半匹马找回来，就得满苗全苗；”
    “要全苗，就得把缺苗的原因去掉。”
    “我再说个意见，缺苗少打粮食，苗多挤在一起也不打粮食。”一面坡村支部书记说：“就说我那谷子吧，缺苗的地方三尺二尺没一根苗，不缺苗的地方像马鬃，密密札札的一圪塔一块。到秋天好些庄稼长不出穗来。就是长个穗，还不如小指尖大，往哪儿打粮食去啊。”
    “这意见正确。”好几个人赞成。四合屯的马景春特别同意这个意见，他说：“就像人吃饭，要是一千人都挤在咱开会的这屋子来，别说吃饭，挤也挤死了。”他的有趣的比譬，引得大家笑起来。可是这位给地主耪了二十年大青、现在成了四合屯农业生产合作社技术员的马景春却一点不笑，反倒一本正经地说：“庄稼和人一样，马鬃样的挤在一块，要地盘没地盘，要粪肥没粪肥，怎么能长起来？”
    “很对，”任国栋情不自禁地插进来：“这意见很重要。”
    “要想多打粮，就得把苗闹匀。”马景春在任国栋的赞许下，更加兴奋起来了，高兴地说：“任书记准是咱庄稼人出身，在行。”
    任书记真是庄稼人出身。他的家在山西。山西种庄稼，可和东北不一样。山西的庄稼行距狭、侍弄的细致，又锄苗又间苗，庄稼长的匀。他常常把家乡种庄稼的情形同东北的比较，每次比较都觉得东北种庄稼的方法浪费了许多土地。“到底垅多宽才合适？”为了解决这问题，他不知往地里看过多少回，他研究各种庄稼的根有多大。他看到高粱、玉茭的根，大约只占半尺方圆的土地，别的庄稼的根占地方就更小了。于是在这个会上，他请村干部们考虑一下：是不是也像关里那样，把行距缩到六、七寸，“就是缩到一尺，也比现在多收一倍的粮食啊。”
    可是，干部们都不同意他的意见。大家说要是改垅，一切农具都得换，没有那么大财力；再说已经过谷雨了，时间上也来不及。虽然这个意见没通过，可是浪费土地的问题，却引起了全体村干部的重视。
    “二尺的垅沟，可是苗眼只有两寸宽。”干部们说。
    “是啊！”任国栋赶紧把这个意见抓住：“就是只用了十分之一的土地啊，十亩地才种着一亩。”什么事情都怕分析，一说透就发现问题了。任国栋的意见引起全体干部的注意。“缩小垅沟不行。”任国栋说：“你们看加宽苗眼行不行？”
    “这法子行。”大家说。
    “这办法高，”凤岗村支部书记胡庆贵也说：
    “地不是不打粮食，是人不要它打粮食。”
    加宽播幅的意见，很快就被大家接受了。大家还研究出什么庄稼应该有多宽的苗眼，怎样留“拐子苗”，以保证庄稼有足够的地盘、粪肥、阳光和空气。
    会议一直进行到深夜。可是人们的劲头越来越足，发言越来越热烈。
    “要想多打粮食就得苗全、苗匀，更高地利用土地，加宽苗幅。”会议结束时，任国栋总结大家的意见说：“这里面等距是最重要的。只要真正作到等距，苗就又全又匀了。说简单点，就是等距的宽播、间苗、保苗。”
    “好，这办法好。”整个会议过程中说话很少，用心思很大的全国农业劳动模范王振堂说话了：“我们马上就向群众进行宣传，实行它。”
    “如果我们再能够分期合理施肥，”任国栋接着说：“我们会得到更高的产量。”
    “等距宽播、间苗、保苗、分期施肥”的新耕作法，就这样产生了。因为它是从群众中来的，是把群众的经验、智慧集中起来，用不着多化钱、多添新农具、多用干部，就能实行的耕作方法，因此，群众是极易接受的。会议的第二天下午，靠山屯村的支部书记李荣福就跑到四合屯向任国栋报告说：“群众劲头大啦，正修订计划哩。”王振堂农业生产合作社也举行了社员大会，把那个不敢向社员公布的计划向社员公布了；社员们不但没嫌计划高，反嫌计划订的太低了。大家讨论后，把原来的计划上规定的每垧平均产量八石三斗，提高到每垧十二石四斗。〔注一〕肇源县已改称郭尔罗斯后旗，因各地读者对“肇源”已很熟悉，所以这里还是用了旧的名字。〔注二〕东北的“石”，每石约合三市石多些，高粱、大豆、麦子、谷子等每石平均重四百五十斤。〔注三〕每“弓”是五尺。
