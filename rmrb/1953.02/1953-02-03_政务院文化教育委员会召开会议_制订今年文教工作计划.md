Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd—The Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee convened a meeting of the directors of the Cultural and Educational Committees of the major administrative areas from January 13th to 24th. The main task of the meeting was to discuss and formulate the national cultural and educational work plan for 1953, and to discuss the tasks and staffing of the cultural and educational administrative organs of the major administrative areas and provinces (municipalities).

    Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee, pointed out at the beginning of the meeting that how to formulate a correct plan is a new issue facing cultural and educational work. Over the past three years, the national cultural and educational undertakings have undergone restoration, reform, and adjustment, and have achieved remarkable results, preparing for large-scale planned economic construction and cultural construction. However, the development of cultural and educational undertakings still lacks planning, and the use of human, material, and financial resources has not been concentrated on key undertakings. There is a great deal of blindness in various tasks; various undertakings have a tendency to simply pursue quantity and ignore quality; ideological leadership and organizational leadership are not sound enough, especially regarding in-depth inspection of work, practical investigation and research, and statistics. To make a plan, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of past work, so that future cultural and educational work can distinguish between the primary and secondary, differentiate between priorities and delays, and develop in a planned and proportional manner. A poorly made plan will delay and disrupt the entire country's construction. We must oppose departmentalism and local viewpoints, as well as one-sided "mass viewpoints" that do not conform to the fundamental and long-term interests of the country. Vice Chairman Xi pointed out that the guiding principle for this year's cultural and educational work should be: consolidate and rectify, focus on development, ensure quality, and advance steadily. The formulation and implementation of the cultural and educational work plan must be based on this guiding principle. Starting this year, the tasks of cultural and educational work are more arduous than in the past, which is a completely new situation, so there must be a good start.

    In order to enable cultural and educational work to better serve economic construction, especially industrial construction, the meeting, based on Vice Chairman Xi's report, conducted serious and repeated discussions on the guiding principles and tasks of this year's cultural and educational work, and determined that the focus of cultural and educational work in 1953 is education and health. The main task is to cultivate talent, especially high- and mid-level technical talent, which must be done with all-out efforts to ensure its completion. To do a good job in cultivating talent, it is necessary to study and solve the problems in the teaching reform of universities and colleges, vigorously consolidate secondary technical schools, and absorb a large number of workers into schools. At the same time, it is necessary to actively train teachers to create conditions for better training of cadres in the future. General education is the foundation of higher education, so it is necessary to consolidate and rectify middle and primary schools, especially primary schools, and run them well. In terms of health work, emphasis should be placed on strengthening and establishing medical and health institutions in cities, industrial and mining areas, and transportation lines; consolidating and rectifying existing county health centers and district health clinics; fighting against infectious diseases, epidemics, and endemic diseases that pose the greatest threat to the people; implementing the principle of combining health work with mass movements; and expanding the patriotic health campaign. Among cultural and educational workers, the ideological remolding movement should be continued; the ideological remolding movement for teachers in higher and secondary schools should be completed; the ideological remolding movement for primary school teachers should be carried out step by step and appropriately; and a study movement should be launched among medical and health personnel, conveying the resolutions of the Second National Health Conference, and using the study to review work and correct thinking and work style. Scientific research work should be strengthened in close combination with national construction, the ranks of scientific workers should be consolidated and enriched, the tendency of scientific research work to deviate from reality should be corrected, and the tendency to only pay attention to solving practical problems and neglecting systematic and basic scientific theoretical research should also be prevented. Cultural and artistic work should be closely combined with economic construction, film projection units should be developed in a planned way, especially projection teams in industrial and mining areas; the film industry should be developed, the quality of domestic films should be improved, and attention should be paid to increasing scientific and technical education films; the work of national theater troupes should be consolidated and strengthened; cultural centers and cultural stations should be consolidated; mass amateur artistic activities should be vigorously carried out; and creation should be organized in a planned way to improve the level of creation. In terms of publishing, the circulation of newspapers and magazines should be controlled, with emphasis on improving the quality of publications; the training of editors and translators should be organized and cultivated; popular reading materials should be published; the review and introduction of publications should be strengthened; and the work of eliminating illiteracy should continue to correct the practice of rushing forward and implement the principle of "active preparation and focused promotion." The main task of sports work is to carry out mass sports activities, train cadres and sports staff, and make sports popular and regular to enhance the people's physical fitness. The meeting also discussed and determined the development targets for various undertakings in 1953.

    Finally, Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun gave a summary of the meeting. He pointed out that after twelve days of intense work, the 1953 plan for national cultural and educational construction has been determined. However, this is not a completely perfect plan. This plan still needs to be taken to the masses for discussion, supplementation, and revision. Without mass discussion, the plan cannot be said to be complete. From no plan to a plan, this is a fundamental change, so there must be a thorough change in ideology and work style. The formulation of a correct plan is the result of fighting against various undesirable tendencies in all aspects, especially blindness and localism. Therefore, the process of formulating a plan is also a process of educating and improving cadres. It is necessary to correct the overly high and large and conservative thinking when formulating the plan. We must oppose emphasizing difficulties. There is no revolutionary work that is not difficult. The difficulties in the construction period will be greater than the difficulties in the war period. We must have a vigorous work style of recognizing difficulties and actively thinking of ways to overcome them. We must give play to initiative and creativity and do more with less money. The plan is not just an order, but it must be implemented in actual actions. However, there is still a big distance between taking it from paper to actual work, which is a very arduous task. In the process of implementing the plan, the struggle between correct and incorrect thinking will be more frequent and intense than when formulating the plan. Someone suggested that the rectification of primary schools should have a transition period of half a year. Of course, it is necessary to implement transitional measures in many tasks, but if the status quo is maintained for the sake of transition, it is a backward manifestation, not a positive manifestation of implementing the plan. The process of implementing the plan is also the process of rectification, consolidation, and development. Thinking that it is necessary to transition before implementing the plan is to separate actual work from the plan, which will lead to a plan on the surface, but in reality, it will still follow the old path. The plan is the law, and once it is set, it must be followed. Not acting according to the plan is a violation of the law, a failure to obey unified leadership, and a phenomenon of anarchy and indiscipline. When talking about leadership style, Vice Chairman Xi pointed out that leadership work cannot be limited to signing and approving documents. Bureaucratic work style in the cultural and educational system is still very serious, and there are also many cases of formalism and commandism. Such a leadership style must be completely changed. To achieve specific leadership, it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspection of work, not only to inspect the annual plan, but also to inspect the quarterly plan and inspect each major task. It is necessary to grasp the main problems and understand the situation in depth. It is necessary to promote fixed staffing and quotas and oppose the supply system thinking. It is necessary to be good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism in work and strengthen organization and discipline. No matter who it is, regardless of the position, must abide by discipline. Not only those who violate laws and regulations will be punished, but also those who are derelict in their duties and fail to complete the plan will be held legally responsible. It is necessary to summarize and promote advanced experience in cultural and educational work, organize revolutionary competitions, and regard cultivating and commending model workers as a regular task, just as exposing and criticizing shortcomings and erroneous tendencies are regular tasks.

    政务院文化教育委员会召开会议
    制订今年文教工作计划
    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会在一月十三日到二十四日召开了各大行政区文化教育委员会主任会议，会议的主要任务是讨论和制订一九五三年的全国文教工作计划，并讨论了大行政区和省（市）文教行政机构的任务和编制问题。
    政务院文化教育委员会副主任习仲勋在会议开始时指出：如何制订正确的计划，是文教工作所面临的新课题。过去三年，全国文化教育事业进行了恢复、改革和调整工作，获得了显著成绩，为有计划的大规模的经济建设和文化建设作了准备。但文教事业的发展还缺乏计划性，人力、物力、财力的使用还没有集中到重点事业上，各种工作中都存在着较大的盲目性；各项事业有单纯追求数量忽视质量的倾向；思想领导和组织领导还不健全，特别是对于工作的深入检查、切实的调查研究和统计做得不够。订计划就必须对过去的工作进行全面系统的检查，使今后文教工作分清主次，区别先后缓急，有计划按比例地发展。计划订不好，就会推迟和搅乱整个国家的建设。要反对本位主义、局部观点，也要反对不合乎国家的根本长远利益的片面的“群众观点”。习副主任指出：今年文教工作的方针应该是：整顿巩固，重点发展，保证质量，稳步前进。文教工作计划的制订和实施必须依据这个方针。从今年开始，文教工作的任务比过去更加繁重了，这完全是一种新的情况，因此必须有一个良好的开端。
    为了使文教工作能更好地为经济建设、首先是工业建设服务，会议根据习副主任的报告，对今年文教工作的方针和任务等问题，进行了认真和反复的讨论，确定了一九五三年文教工作中的重点是教育和卫生，主要的任务是培养人材，特别是培养高、中级技术人材，这是必须全力以赴保证完成的。要做好培养人材的工作，必须研究和解决高等学校教学改革中的问题，大力整顿中等技术学校，并吸收大量工人进入学校。同时要积极培养师资，为今后更好地培养干部创造条件。普通教育是高等教育的基础，因此要整顿巩固中、小学，特别要大力整顿小学，把它办好。卫生工作方面，应着重加强和建立城市、工矿和交通线的医疗卫生机构；整顿巩固已有的县卫生院、区卫生所；与危害人民最大的传染病、流行病和地方病作斗争，贯彻卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针，扩大爱国卫生运动。在文教工作者中间，要继续开展思想改造运动；完成高等、中等学校教师的思想改造运动；有步骤地、适当地开展小学教师的思想改造运动；在医务卫生人员中开展学习运动，传达第二届全国卫生会议的决议，经过学习来检查工作，端正思想和作风。应当在与国家建设密切结合的基础上加强科学研究工作，整顿充实科学工作者的队伍，纠正科学研究工作脱离实际的偏向，也要防止只注意解决实际问题，而轻视系统的基本的科学理论研究的偏向。文化艺术工作要和经济建设密切结合起来，要有步骤地发展电影放映单位，特别是工矿区的放映队；要发展电影事业，提高国产片的质量，注意增加科学技术教育影片；整顿和加强全国剧团工作；整顿文化馆、文化站；大力开展群众性的业余艺术活动；有计划地组织创作，提高创作水平。出版事业方面要控制报纸、杂志的发行量，着重提高出版物的质量；组织和培养编辑翻译人材；出版通俗读物；加强出版物的评介工作；扫除文盲工作要继续纠正冒进的做法，贯彻“积极准备、重点推行”的方针。体育工作主要是开展群众性的体育运动，培养干部、训练体育员，使体育普及和经常化，以增强人民的体质。会议并讨论和确定了一九五三年各种事业发展的指标。
    会议最后由习仲勋副主任作了总结。他指出：经过十二天的紧张工作，全国文教建设的一九五三年计划已经确定了。但这还不是十分完备的计划，这个计划还需要拿到群众中去讨论、补充和修正，不经过群众讨论，计划还不能说是完备的。从无计划到有计划，这是一个根本性的转变，因而思想上、作风上都要有彻底的转变。正确的计划的制订，就是和各方面的各种不良倾向、首先是盲目性和地方主义进行斗争的结果，因此制订计划的过程也就是教育提高干部的过程。要纠正制订计划时那种偏高偏大的和保守的思想。要反对强调困难。革命工作没有不困难的，建设时期的困难比战争时期的困难会更大。我们要有认清困难，积极想办法克服困难的生气勃勃的作风。要发挥积极性和创造性，以少量的钱办更多的事。计划并不是一纸命令，而是要把它贯彻到实际行动中去。但从纸上拿到实际工作中去，中间还有很大的距离，这是很艰巨的工作。在执行计划的过程中，正确思想和不正确思想的斗争会比制订计划时更多，更剧烈。有人提出小学的整顿要有半年的过渡时期。当然在许多工作中实行过渡办法是必要的，但如果为了过渡而继续维持原状，那就是落后的表现，而不是积极实现计划的表现。计划实行的过程，也就是整顿、巩固和发展的过程。认为必须过渡一下再来实行计划，就是把实际工作和计划分割开来，就会表面有计划，实际还是按着老道路走。计划就是法律，一经订下，就要遵守。不按计划办事就是违法行为，就是不服从统一领导，也就是无政府无纪律的现象。在谈到领导作风时，习副主任指出：领导工作不能限于签名画行。文教系统中的官僚主义作风还很严重，文牍主义、命令主义也不少。这样的领导作风必须彻底转变。要做到具体领导，必须深入检查工作，不仅是检查年度计划，而且要检查季度计划，检查一件件主要工作。要抓住主要的问题深入地了解情况。要提倡定员定额，反对供给制思想。要善于在工作中运用批评和自我批评的武器，加强组织性纪律性。不论什么人，不管职位高低，都要遵守纪律。不仅违法乱纪的要受到处分，失职的、不能完成计划的都要负法律上的责任。要在文教工作中总结和推广先进经验，组织革命竞赛，要把培养表扬模范工作者当成经常性的工作，正如揭发和批评缺点和错误倾向是经常性的工作一样。
