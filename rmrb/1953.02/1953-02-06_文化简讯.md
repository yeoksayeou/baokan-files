Central-Level Publishing Houses Gradually Lower Book Prices

To reduce the burden on readers, central-level publishing houses, according to the instructions of the Central People's Government's General Administration of Publications, have initially lowered book prices. For example, with the pricing at the end of 1951 as 100, the average reduction for general books (textbooks for primary and secondary schools were originally priced lower than general books) by the People's Publishing House and the People's Education Publishing House is 11.84%; the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, 20%; the People's Literature Publishing House, 11%; the China Youth Publishing House, 21.24%; the Workers' Publishing House, 15%; the Fuel Industry Publishing House, 5%; popular science and technology books published by the Mechanical Industry Publishing House, 11.6%; the Commercial Press, 8.6%; and Zhonghua Book Company, 6%. The different ratios of price reductions among the publishing houses are due to the different original prices of various books, different cost structures, and different business operations of the publishing houses. In addition, some books have also published popular editions, which can reduce a portion of the selling price.

Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology Established

The preparatory committee of the Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology convened its first member representative assembly on January 25th, formally establishing the Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology.

At the meeting, Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, explained that the task of the Association for Science and Technology Popularization is to organize scientific workers to use their spare time to popularize scientific and technological knowledge among the workers, peasants, and soldiers; this work is very important for large-scale economic construction.

After full discussion, the assembly formulated the association's charter, determined the work outline for 1953, and elected Qian Chonglin, Wang Shuzhuang, Hua Nangui, and 18 others as standing committee members of the Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology.
