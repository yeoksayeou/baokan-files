The Constitution is Locked Away
    Soviet Union Saslavsky

    What is American democracy?
    "A mockery of the people."
    Mr. José Figueres, who once served as President of the Republic of Costa Rica, wrote in the American magazine "Economics and Sociology" (January 1952 issue):
    Are there human rights in America?
    "Only on paper, only in the original manuscript of the Constitution," says José Figueres.
    "Dangerous paper! Anti-American original manuscript!" Senator McCarran shouted. "Take this paper away, take this original manuscript away!"
    McCarran's words are iron law.
    In mid-December 1952, in Washington, the capital of the United States, officials of the State Department, with music by Offenbach, ceremoniously moved the dangerous "Declaration of Independence" and the original manuscript of the Constitution—monuments of the American democratic system—from a storage room open to visitors to an inaccessible air-raid shelter.
    When the cabinet containing these manuscripts was lifted into place, the American president contentedly tapped the steel plate of the cabinet, felt the heavy latch, and said, "Now they can't fly away!"
    At a press conference held that day, he said: "Needless to say, freedom of speech contains danger. ..."
    ×××
    Turning the original manuscript of the American Constitution into an idol and holding a solemn ceremony to move them into a steel cabinet is, on the surface, out of concern for the danger of an atomic air raid.
    It goes without saying that this is daydreaming, a new means of inciting atomic madness. The heads of Wall Street deliberately put on a show, a ritual of venerating the original manuscript of the Constitution, simply to conceal their true ideas of insulting the Constitution and their actions of trampling on human rights.
    As long as the embers of bourgeois democratic freedom have not been extinguished, as long as the ruling class still wants some liberal trickery, the original manuscript of the Constitution does not seem to be in any danger. Now they have eliminated even this remnant. The historically significant original manuscript is a thorn in their side. It exposes the arrogant monopolists. It evokes dangerous thoughts among the people with its stark contrast between word and deed.
    The original manuscript of the American Constitution has been removed from the sight of the people to clear the way for fascism. The spirits of the founders of the Constitution—Washington and Jefferson—had to leave the place where the monuments of the American democratic system were placed.
    In America, democracy is being destroyed in this way.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside."
    But this banner has not been eliminated. Representatives of the Communist Party and democratic parties have taken it up.
    The American people have noble revolutionary traditions. They are full of vigor and participate in the struggle of the outstanding sons and daughters of the American people for peace, democracy and human rights.
    The bourgeoisie turns these historical documents of the American democratic system into documentary exhibits. In their fear, they now simply remove these exhibits from the eyes of the people and seal them in steel coffins as harmless idols.
    A wasted effort!

### 宪法给关起来了

    宪法给关起来了
    苏联  萨斯拉夫斯基
    美国的民主是什么？
    “对人民的嘲讽。”
    曾当过哥斯达黎加共和国总统的豪塞·费盖列斯先生在美国“经济学与社会学”杂志（一九五二年一月号）上这么写道：
    在美国有没有人权？
    “只在纸上，只在宪法原稿上”，豪塞·费盖列斯说。
    “危险的纸！反美国的原稿！”参议员麦卡伦叫喊道。“拿去这纸，拿去这原稿！”
    麦卡伦的话就是铁的法律。
    一九五二年十二月中旬在美国首都华盛顿，国务院的官吏们在奥芳巴克音乐伴奏下煞有介事地把危险的“独立宣言”和宪法原稿——美国民主制度的纪念物从观众可以参观的保管室移放到不能参观的防空洞。
    当装着这些原稿的柜子抬到预定的地方，美国总统满意地敲敲柜子的钢板，摸了摸那笨重的闩，然后说道：“现在可飞不走了！”
    就在那一天举行的记者招待会上他说道：“不用说，言论的自由包含着危险。……”
    ×××
    把美国宪法原稿变为偶像，并举行把它们移放钢柜的堂而皇之的仪式，表面上好像是出于耽心原子空袭的危险。
    不言自明，这是白天说梦话，这是煽动原子狂的新手段。华尔街的头子们故意装模作样来一个尊崇宪法原稿的仪式，无非是为了掩饰他们侮辱宪法的真正思想、掩饰他们蹂躏人权的行动而已。
    只要资产阶级民主自由的余烬还没有熄灭，只要统治阶级还要什么自由主义的把戏，那么宪法原稿看来就不致发生什么危险。现在他们连这点残余也给消灭了。具有历史意义的原稿是他们的眼中钉。它使骄横的垄断资本家原形毕露。它以言与行之间的鲜明对照唤起人民中间的危险思想。
    美国宪法的原稿从人民可以观览的地方拿开了，好为法西斯主义扫清道路。宪法的缔造者——华盛顿和杰弗逊的魂灵不得不离开安放美国民主制度纪念物的位置。
    在美国，民主制度就是如此被摧残着。
    斯大林同志指出：“资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。”
    但是这面旗帜并没有被消灭掉。共产党和民主党派的代表打起了它。
    美国人民有着崇高的革命传统。他们生气勃勃，参加到美国人民优秀儿女争取和平、民主与人权的斗争中。
    资产阶级把美国民主制度这些历史性文件变成文献展览品。他们心悸之余，现在索性连这些展览品也从人民的眼前拿开，作为无害的偶像封进钢棺材了。
    白费心机！
