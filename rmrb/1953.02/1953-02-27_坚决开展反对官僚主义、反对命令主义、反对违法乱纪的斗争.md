    Resolutely Carry Out the Struggle Against Bureaucracy, Commandism, and Illegal and Disciplined Activities
    Xiang Ming, Second Secretary of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    For more than three years, under the correct leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the CPC Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, and under the direct leadership of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Party organizations and the entire people of Shandong have victoriously completed the historical task of recovery and transformation. We have healed the war wounds caused by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, restored and developed industrial and agricultural production, strived to achieve a fundamental improvement in the economic situation, stabilized and initially improved the people's economic life, continued to deepen the struggle of the people's democratic revolution, eliminated the remaining forces of imperialism and feudalism, implemented the socialist transformation of new democracy, greatly improved the people's awareness and enthusiasm, strongly supported the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, expanded the patriotic people's democratic united front, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and thereby created the necessary conditions for welcoming the national large-scale construction tasks. This is our great, glorious, and correct aspect. But we must never forget that our work still has many shortcomings and mistakes, and there are still some ideological, stylistic, and organizational impurities in our Party ranks. These ideological, stylistic, and organizational impurities in the Party ranks are precisely one of the important reasons for the many shortcomings and errors in our work.
    Even on the eve of the national victory, Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "To win the victory throughout the country is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. If this step is also worth being proud of, it is relatively insignificant, and what is more worthy of pride is yet to come. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, so that the comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, non-arrogant, and non-impetuous style, and the comrades must continue to maintain a style of hard struggle. We have the Marxist-Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism. We can eliminate bad styles and maintain good styles." We should soberly remember Chairman Mao's admonition. Looking back, although we have made a big step forward in the past three years, what about looking forward? There is still a very, very long way to go to realize the future of national industrialization and the socialist goal.
    During the period of economic recovery and transformation in our country, the Party organizations in Shandong, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, continuously carried out the work of rectifying the Party ranks. In the autumn of 1950, we conducted a cadre rectification movement in organizations at all levels, focusing on overcoming bureaucracy and commandism. From December 1951 to May 1952, we launched the "Three-Anti" movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in leading organs at all levels above the county level. On the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, we immediately carried out the Party rectification work in organs at all levels. During this period, the rural Party rectification work, after the first batch of typical experiments and the second batch of gradual expansion, has been completed and is being carried out in two thousand five hundred and sixty-nine township branches and one thousand two hundred and ninety-four village branches. In view of the fact that rectifying the Party's primary organizations in rural areas is an extremely arduous task, we must adopt a positive and steady approach to continue, and strive to victoriously complete the task of rural Party rectification this year and the first half of next year.
    The situation of the Party organization in Shandong, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out at the First National Organizational Work Conference of the Communist Party of China: "There are a large number of excellent Party members who meet the conditions of a communist party member in our Party, and these Party members inherit, adhere to and carry forward the fine traditions of our Party. However, there are also some Party members in our Party: Among these Party members, some are not fully qualified as communist party members, or have more serious problems, or have lost the conditions for communist party members. These people must be transformed and improved before they can be a party member. Another part does not have the conditions for a communist party member and does not play a role or plays a small role in the Party. They are passive elements. If they are not educated and transformed, they cannot be a party member. There are also a few bad elements who have infiltrated the Party. These bad elements should be immediately removed from the Party." "The reasons for the existence of these problems in our Party's organization, in addition to the shortcomings in our work mentioned earlier, are also due to objective historical reasons. That is to say, our Party was in the dispersed rural areas for a long time in the past, and relied on the vast masses of farmers in the old liberated areas to defeat the reactionaries. The Party organizations and most of the Party members in the old liberated areas have done their best and played their role in the war. Also, due to the tense war environment, our Party has not yet had time to conduct systematic education and organizational consolidation for them. Due to this objective historical situation, coupled with many shortcomings in our Party building work, our great, glorious, and correct Party still retains or has the above-mentioned problems. We must now seriously and carefully deal with these problems. We must seriously, carefully, planned, and step by step rectify the Party ranks in accordance with these instructions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, overcome the existing ideological, stylistic, and organizational impurities in the Party, and overcome various negative and unhealthy phenomena in the Party. At the same time, we must also follow the instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee on January 5th and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on January 29th, and follow the instructions of Chairman Mao, Comrades Zhou Enlai, and An Ziwen at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC, and launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.
    The bureaucratic work style of organs above the district level, the commandist work style of grass-roots organizations below the district level, and the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some cadres in Shandong Province have been somewhat changed after the cadre rectification in the autumn of 1950, with the launch of the three major movements of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Land Reform, and Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries in 1951, but they have not been fundamentally overcome; and there has been new development in 1952.
    Although the democratic life inside the organs has indeed been improved, the relationship between leaders and those being led has indeed been improved, the enthusiasm and awareness of the broad masses of cadres has indeed been improved, and the phenomena of corruption and waste have indeed been overcome since the "Three-Anti" movement in organs above the county level in 1952, the bureaucratic phenomena have grown with new vigor due to the lack of in-depth inspection of work. During this period, the bureaucratic work style of leading organs from the provincial level to the county level has the following prominent manifestations:
    (1) When deploying work, without proceeding from reality, without investigating and studying the situation, without adapting to the needs and awareness of the masses, and without considering objective possibilities, but blindly proceeding from subjective wishes and a simple task-oriented point of view, with emphasis on giving tasks, setting time limits, and pursuing figures, without emphasizing explaining policies, methods, and work styles. What is worse is that no matter what the work is, the method of apportioning task figures is adopted, apportioning them level by level. For example, digging wells, fighting drought, promoting Si-character cotton, planting trees and afforestation, lending waterwheels, lending fertilizers, storing and purchasing in advance, prize savings, livestock insurance, selling books and newspapers, etc., many of which are blindly apportioned level by level from the relevant business departments at the provincial level.
    (2) When organizing the implementation after the deployment of work, failing to conduct in-depth and specific guidance, failing to grasp typical demonstrations, failing to conduct in-depth inspections of work at the lower levels, and failing to discover and correct deviations in the work in a timely manner.
    (3) At the end of a work item, failing to summarize the work and educate cadres, or even if summarizing, only focusing on the task figures and disregarding the actual effect and consequences, without focusing on summarizing the experience of policy work style.
    (4) Leading organs at all levels, especially provincial-level leading organs, are accustomed to sitting in their offices to sign documents and issue forms. Last year, each department or bureau of the provincial government issued an average of more than 3,000 documents downward. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued 3,348 documents in the name of the department and 7,742 documents in the name of its subordinate bureaus and offices. Another example is the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, which sent and received 22,653 documents throughout the year. The Jinan Municipal Bureau alone sent and received as many as eight documents back and forth with the Provincial Bureau for the problem of repairing and replacing electric light wires. Provincial departments abused the issuance of forms, even forms for counting chicken feathers. According to the feedback from below, the method of dealing with these forms is: "What the above wants, the below makes up"; "Look down and think, look up and count." In Xizhuang Township, Fifth District, Gaomi County, each statistical report was estimated and filled out by the clerk. The cadres of the township praised the clerk, saying: "Our township has a good clerk, close your eyes, and the numbers come out."
    (5) There are too many meetings in leading organs at all levels from the province and below. Many meetings are unnecessary and could have been avoided, and many meetings, although necessary, wasted time due to a lack of sufficient preparation in advance. In particular, the meetings of the departments of the Provincial Government lack unified control, and there is a phenomenon of randomly convening meetings. Because there are too many and too chaotic meetings in the leading organs at the upper levels, the lower-level organizations also have this phenomenon. For example, a village cadre reflected: "Our village has four groups of people going to the township for meetings in one day: patriotic health meeting, land survey and assessment meeting, cooperative member expansion meeting, and women's work meeting. Go back to the village to hold a package meeting, six people talked about four things, we talk about ours, the masses are sleepy." Another example is that some masses reflected that there are five "mores" in meetings: "More people speak, more things are said, more time is spent in the meeting, more people listening to the meeting are sleepy, and more things on the meeting are incomprehensible."
    (6) From the provincial level to the lower-level leading organs, especially the Provincial Government, due to the lack of strong and effective unified leadership, there is a phenomenon of decentralism with multiple policies from various departments. Some departments even have serious organizational and disciplinary status. In addition, the various business departments lack ideological and political leadership, lack an overall concept, and have a purely business perspective. Therefore, the work of various business departments has a tendency to isolate from the central task. The comrades below reflect: "Random arrows are fired," "Multiple heads and multiple brains," "A chaotic pole to catch the head," "The center is not the center," "The above is scientific division of labor, the district is all embracing downward, and the township is a mess." These words are criticizing the "multiple policies" phenomenon in the superior leadership.
    (7) The leading organs at all levels from the province and below do not provide enough ideological education for cadres, and there are many shortcomings in understanding, cultivating, selecting, and using cadres. In particular, after the repeated large-scale transfer of cadres in rural areas, cadres have not been promoted and supplemented in a timely manner, and the district-level organizations have formed an extremely unsound organization and a serious phenomenon of busy work and few people because the district cadres are transferred to participate in the Party rectification work team.
    (8) The leading organs at all levels do not study the work situation below, do not care about the difficulties in the work of the lower levels, do not answer and solve the problems raised by the lower levels in a timely manner; do not understand the emotions and sufferings of the people; turn a blind eye to bad people and bad deeds, and do not punish and deal with them; do not support and praise good people and good deeds; do not attach importance to handling the people's letters, and adopt a "transfer, suppress, push, drag" attitude. The province statistically accumulated about 100,000 letters from the people in the first half of last year, and after repeated urging and inspection, many organs still have not paid attention to this work.
    The above is the main manifestation of the bureaucratic work style of leading organs at all levels in our province. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Now there are very serious phenomena of commandism and violations of law and discipline in many grass-roots organizations and grass-roots cadres. The occurrence and growth of this phenomenon are inseparable from the bureaucracy of leading organs and leading cadres." Bureaucracy is a hotbed for the generation of commandism and the growth of violations of law and discipline. The actual situation in our province fully proves this truth. Therefore, to overcome commandism and the phenomenon of violation of laws and disciplines, it must be emphasized that we must first start with opposing bureaucracy.
    It is precisely because our leading organs at all levels have this serious bureaucratic style, and because the organs above the county level were busy with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the first half of last year and failed to go deep into the lower levels to guide and inspect work, and after the end of the "Three-Anti" movement in the organs, the work tasks of various business departments "embraced downward" together in the second half of last year, forming a situation of "random arrows firing," and because there were too many tasks, some cadres at the lower levels mistakenly adopted the "three-anti tiger hunting" method to carry out work, and because there was not enough education for grass-roots cadres, and because they inherited the wartime work methods of the past, and because some grass-roots organizations were impure, the commandist work style in rural work showed an increasing trend throughout the year last year. Although we have repeatedly issued notices to correct this and repeatedly urged the handling of people's letters last year, because we did not pay enough attention to it, did not grasp it tightly, and did not criticize it severely, especially because we did not emphasize starting with overcoming the bureaucratic work style of the leading organs, and did not conduct in-depth inspections and take effective measures, this serious phenomenon of commandism has not been fundamentally changed so far.
    This commandist work style is not only reflected in the rural grass-roots cadres and grass-roots organizations, but also manifested in various aspects of work to varying degrees. For example, the postal and telecommunications bureaus and bookstores promoting the sale of books and newspapers, banks promoting prize savings, cooperatives lending fertilizer, lending waterwheels, and storing and purchasing in advance, and agricultural and forestry departments promoting well digging and the promotion of Si-character cotton, etc., all adopted the method of apportioning task figures level by level from the provincial level. The only difference between this and the commandist work style of grass-roots organizations is that it is not directly apportioned to the masses. Our leading cadres often do not distinguish the nature of the work, do not consider the time conditions, do not consider the degree of awareness of the masses, do not consider the objective possibilities, do not explain the policies and methods, and one-sidedly emphasize:
    "This is the task of the higher levels, and it must be completed within the time limit." This is actually a commandist work style. Zhang Zuochen, the former county magistrate of Cangshan County, mobilized cadres to force cotton farmers to pull out small cotton, and put forward the slogan "It is better to force early than to force late." This is actually the same as the slogan that the Cangshan County Party Committee repeatedly emphasized at cadre meetings, "If the task is not completed, it will be dealt with by law." Therefore, to oppose the commandist work style, we should not only start by opposing the bureaucratic work style, but also overcome the commandist work style of leading organs and leading cadres at all levels while opposing the bureaucratic struggle.
    In order to effectively overcome this bad habit of commandism, in addition to first overcoming the bureaucratic work style of our leading organs, strengthening leadership responsibility, improving leadership methods, changing leadership work style, and effectively criticizing and correcting this bad habit of commandism, we should especially repeatedly educate cadres from the positive side, improve their ideological level and political awareness, strengthen their mass viewpoint and the idea of serving the people, so that they understand the method of persuading and educating the masses, and learn the method of being good at relying on the masses and uniting the masses; from the specific inspection and summary of the work, we must use both good and bad typical examples, that is, the different results produced by the two different methods of the mass line and commandism, to educate cadres. There are a large number of excellent Party members and excellent cadres in our grass-roots organizations. They have unlimited loyalty to the people's cause. They earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions and truly deserve to be the people's servants. Model Party members and cadres who closely connect with the people and take the mass line in everything, such as Comrade Li Ruilan, the township head of Da'an Township in Fei County, and Comrade Zhang Liancheng, the branch secretary of Wuzhai Township in Guangrao County, should be greatly commended and used as models for our Party members and cadres.
    For a few cadres with bad qualities, especially for some grass-roots cadres with impure composition and bad elements who seriously violate laws and disciplines, we should deal with them separately according to several types.
    The first type of bad element is class alien elements or degenerate elements. They have consistently abused their power, oppressed the masses, extorted, embezzled, raped women, and committed all kinds of evil. These bad elements have actually become new-style bullies. For example, Wang Shukun, Wang Sushen, and Sun Shiwen, bad cadres in Kangmiao Township, Eighth District of Jining County, and Wang Laijun, a militia member, etc., have all become enemies hated by the people. (For the handling of this case, see Shandong Dazhong Daily, February 8)
    The second type of bad element is counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated our grass-roots organizations. They usurp leadership, safeguard the interests of landlords, undermine policies and laws, and preside over or cover up counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Yu Xianli, Yu Xianyang and other counter-revolutionary elements in Xialiulian Village, Laiyang County, usurped and manipulated the village's power and people's armed forces, cruelly exploited the masses, arbitrarily fined grain and money, and used guns to rape women, even young girls. They tortured, insulted, detained, controlled and persecuted military dependents and workers' dependents. Seventeen households were beaten, scolded, detained, and controlled. Two people were forced to commit suicide, and four were beaten to death. (This case is currently being processed)
    The third type of bad element is a serious anti-Party and anti-people bureaucrat. They used their powers to undermine the people's democratic system, violate the people's democratic rights, suppress criticism, and retaliate against critics. For example, Liu Bende, the former secretary of the Yinqiao District Party Committee in Jimo County, was used by Gao Huiling, the former village branch secretary of Qianyang Village in the district, and Wang Wenman, the director of the Qianyang Village Farmers Association. During the democratic government building movement, when the masses were brewing to elect their representatives and replace bad cadres, he actually condoned Gao Huiling and others to retaliate against the masses. He gathered militias and armed salt police to beat the masses for two days and two nights. 138 households and more than 160 people were beaten.
    (The handling of this case was published in Shandong Dazhong Daily on August 25, 1952)
    The fourth type of bad element is a serious anti-Party and anti-people commandist. In their work, they disregarded the interests of the people, disregarded the political influence of the Party and the People's Government, and consistently and seriously forced the masses, violated policies, and caused serious losses to the cause of the Party and the people. For example, Zhang Zuochen, the former county magistrate of Cangshan County, acted arbitrarily. In the "cleaning of cotton fields," he used all means to order the masses to force the masses to remove small cotton, causing seven districts, eighteen townships, seventy-five villages, 1,360 peasant households, and more than 490 mu of cotton fields to be destroyed. (The handling of this case was published in Shandong Dazhong Daily on January 20)
    The fifth type of bad element is one who has serious selfish and exploiting class consciousness and has not been thoroughly transformed or has seriously lost his revolutionary stand. They use public office for private gain, seize the fruits of the land reform struggle, borrow and use white without returning, exploit at high interest, use mass labor without compensation, or condone fraud, lose their stand, harbor landlords, and let go of counter-revolutionary elements. For example, Dong Yubin, the representative of Nanyu Village in Xintai County, occupied two mu of land gained from the land reform struggle, and exchanged good and near land of military families for bad and remote land, and exchanged pawned land for dead deed land of the masses. In the past year alone, he asked the masses to cultivate 260 workers for him. Another example is Zhang Zijing, the branch secretary of Shilixiang in Qidong, who harbored a counter-revolutionary element for three years. The masses used anonymous letters to tell him, "Zhang Zijing shouts to catch spies every day, but he has a spy hidden in his own house. Why doesn't he catch it?"
    The treatment of these law-breaking and discipline-violating bad elements should be strictly distinguished from the treatment of those who have committed general bureaucratic and commandist errors. Those who have committed general bureaucratic and commandist errors mostly belong to the problem of impure ideology and work style, and we should adopt the policy of education and transformation and adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to overcome their mistakes; of course, those who have repeatedly refused to be taught and still persist in their mistakes must be given appropriate disciplinary punishment. However, law-breaking and discipline-violating bad elements are not only impure in their ideology and work style, but are also seriously anti-Party and anti-people and seriously violate state laws and Party discipline. Therefore, they must be severely punished in accordance with state laws and Party discipline. Of course, the specific handling of the aforementioned five types of law-breaking and discipline-violating bad elements should also be different. The first and second types of bad elements must be arrested and dealt with according to law, and given criminal penalties according to the crimes they have committed, ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty. If they are Communist Party members, they should be expelled from the Party; the third and fourth types of bad elements whose circumstances are serious should also be given the criminal penalties they deserve. If they are Communist Party members, they should also be expelled from the Party; the third and fourth types of bad elements whose circumstances are relatively minor must also be given the Party and outside Party punishment they deserve; the punishment of the fifth type of bad elements,
    Generally speaking, it should be lighter than the previous four types of bad elements, but the land and property seized from the masses must be ordered to be returned, the labor price exploited from the masses must be compensated, and if there are criminal crimes, they should also be given criminal penalties. If they are Communist Party members, they should also be expelled from the Party.
    In the past, we were not serious enough in maintaining state laws and Party discipline. Some of our leading cadres have the wrong idea of ​​conniving and condoning bad elements who violate laws and disciplines. For example, when dealing with bad cadres who violate laws and disciplines, they often delay processing or deal with them leniently, citing "past merits" and "active work." We should realize that our Party does not have two kinds of discipline, ordinary Party members should be dealt with strictly, how can leading cadres be dealt with leniently! Similarly, our state law does not have two kinds, ordinary people should be dealt with strictly, how can cadres be dealt with leniently! Among some of our leading cadres, there is another wrong understanding, fearing that severely punishing bad elements who violate laws and disciplines will repeat the mistake of "moving stones" and "kicking" some rural grass-roots cadres in the spring of 1948. This is obviously a failure to correctly recognize that the lesson of "moving stones" and "kicking" at that time was: not treating commandist elements and bad elements who violated laws and disciplines separately, but "kicking off the stage" together. Therefore, the former did not adopt the policy of transformation and education, and was too strict; the latter did not give the legal punishment they deserved, and was too lenient. Today, as long as the former and the latter are treated differently, the mistake of "moving stones" and "kicking" will never be repeated in the past. Leniently condoning bad elements who violate laws and disciplines is to destroy the seriousness of state laws and Party discipline, and is cruelty to the people. Leading cadres at all levels must change their wrong ideas, enforce Party discipline and state law seriously, and severely punish bad elements who violate laws and disciplines.
    At present, the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and disciplines have seriously harmed the cause of our people, hindered the implementation of our various tasks, suppressed the enthusiasm of the people, strangled the initiative of various revolutionary organizations, and destroyed the close connection between Party organizations, people's governments at all levels, and the people. Both the bureaucratic and commandist ideology and work style, and the bad crimes of violating laws and disciplines, are incompatible with proletarian ideology - Mao Zedong Thought, are incompatible with our Party's ideology, work style and glorious traditions, and are incompatible with the interests of the people's cause. In terms of its social roots, it is a reflection of the reactionary ruling class's reactionary work style towards the people - the remnants of the Kuomintang's reactionary work style towards the people within our Party and the People's Government. We must mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to carry out a persistent struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and bad elements who violate laws and disciplines!
    In order to further carry out this struggle, we must carry out the following tasks:
    1. We must conscientiously study the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party and the East China Bureau, conscientiously discuss the prominent bureaucratic, commandist, and law-breaking and discipline-violating events that have been announced, and combine them with the exposure of serious bureaucratic, commandist, and law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena that exist in our own regions and units to improve the ideological understanding of cadres. We must first overcome the tendency to underestimate the severity and harm of bureaucracy, commandism, and law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena, which is the main danger in the ideological thinking of cadres at present. However, after overcoming this main dangerous tendency, we must prevent the possible negative, "sweeping," non-analyzing, hasty, and impatient emotions. The unfolding of this struggle must grasp the unwavering, targeted, hit-the-point, and gradual in-depth approach.
    2. This struggle must be combined with various tasks and must never be separated from various tasks. The unfolding of this struggle should not copy the "Three-Anti" method of last year as an overriding central task, nor can it be carried out with an attitude of "superficial scratching" and perfunctory. We must understand that the execution of work tasks and the adoption of correct policies, correct work styles, and correct methods cannot be separated. Therefore, it is most appropriate to carry out this struggle by obeying the current work, grasping the current work, combining the current work, and carrying out this struggle through the current work. We must combine the rectification of cadres' ideology and work style in the current tasks, and be good at preventing and eliminating the occurrence of bureaucracy, commandism, and law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena. In the deployment of each task, we must proceed from reality, fully estimate the realistic possibilities based on the awareness level of the masses, and while giving work tasks, emphasize the explanation of policies, work styles, and methods, and never simply pursue tasks, pursue numbers, and pursue time. After each task is deployed, we must grasp the method of typical demonstration, conduct in-depth inspections, introduce advanced experience in a timely manner, and correct deviations in a timely manner. When each task is completed and summarized, we must emphasize the experience from the policies, work styles, methods, and practical effects and consequences of completing the task to educate cadres. That is to say, the leadership policy adopted to carry out this struggle should be: while resolutely opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena, we must prevent the occurrence of new biases, and we must step up the construction of correct ideology and work style, so that we can consolidate the achievements of the struggle. Of course, to carry out this struggle, we must also carry out some special work, such as checking the implementation of the Party committee system, checking and summarizing past work with emphasis and purpose, holding mobilization meetings, checking and processing people's letters, checking and processing law-breaking and discipline-violating cases, etc. However, when carrying out these special tasks, on the one hand, we must carry them out without disrupting the current tasks, and on the other hand, we must use these tasks to better promote the current tasks.
    3. To carry out this struggle, we must be good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and we must be good at combining self-criticism from top to bottom with criticism from bottom to top well. To carry out this struggle, we must first have self-criticism from top to bottom, and drive at all levels. Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels must first review and correct the bureaucratic work style in order to promote the conscious review of the bureaucratic work style by lower-level organs and leading cadres, and to promote the conscious review and correction of the commandist work style by lower-level organizations and cadres in districts and townships, and then turn to leading the masses to conduct criticism from bottom to top, especially by handling the people's letters and handling typical cases to mobilize the broad masses of the people. Actively support criticism from bottom to top from the broad masses of the people. Anti-people elements who suppress criticism and infringe on the people's democratic rights should be punished in a timely manner. It is entirely appropriate to quote Comrade Malenkov's words here: "It is wrong to think that criticism from bottom to top can unfold automatically in a free-flowing manner. Criticism from the bottom up can unfold and expand only when everyone who raises healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization and be sure that the shortcomings he points out will be truly eliminated. It is necessary to make Party organizations and Party workers, together with all our leaders, lead this movement and set an example of honesty and sincerity in dealing with criticism." When using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, we must especially grasp the correct use of Party newspapers and the correct handling of people's letters. We must understand that criticism and self-criticism is the door to carrying out this struggle, and the use of Party newspapers and the handling of people's letters are the keys to opening this door.
    4. In carrying out this struggle, we must grasp the key points, grasp the typical, and promote the general through the key points and the typical. Each level of leadership should grasp key units, and each unit should grasp key events and key figures, so as to promote general units and educate general cadres through this key point. In grasping typical cases, in the early stage of the movement, we should focus on grasping bad people and bad deeds with great educational significance, and vigorously carry out exposure and criticism; in the later stage of the movement, we should focus on grasping good people and good deeds with great educational significance, and vigorously carry out publicity and promotion. In this regard, the inspection teams sent by the provincial organs should firmly grasp the policy of focusing on handling cases, mobilizing the masses, and promoting the general, the newspapers should carefully organize reports, and carry out publicity through key points and typical cases.
    5. It is a more important key to combine the work of Party rectification and Party building with the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against punishment of law-breaking and discipline-violating elements. According to existing experience, rural branch Party rectification can basically correct the commandist work style and eliminate the phenomenon of violation of laws and disciplines. In the future rural work, we should focus on carrying out the patriotic bumper harvest movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and combine it with Party rectification. The main purpose of Party rectification is to solve the ideological tendency of rich peasant exploitation, correct the commandist work style, and overcome the phenomenon of violation of laws and disciplines. In the future, in the cities, industrial and mining areas, and rural late-liberated areas, the work of Party building should also be closely combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against punishment of law-breaking and discipline-violating elements.
    6. Another important key is to combine the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against punishment of law-breaking and discipline-violating elements through the work of people's congresses at all levels and the upcoming general election movement and the convening of people's congresses at all levels. First of all, we must discuss and handle some of the people's letters through the township representative meetings or township congresses, the urban district representative meetings or congresses. Those that cannot be handled or should not be handled by the township or urban district representative meetings or congresses should be submitted to the relevant authorities or the higher-level representative meetings or congresses for handling. At present, the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against punishing law-breaking and discipline-violating elements is also the preparatory work for this year's general election movement.
    7. In carrying out this struggle, we must pay special attention to the work of active ideological construction. We must recognize that this is a struggle between the old and the new things. On the one hand, "the old will not go, the new will not come." On the other hand, "the new will not come, the old will not die." To eliminate the old, we must build new to replace it. The old will certainly not die naturally, and the new shoots will not naturally thrive without irrigation and cultivation. In this struggle, we must clearly put forward what to oppose and what to advocate. To oppose the reactionary ideas and work styles of the reactionary ruling class and the Kuomintang, we must at the same time advocate the ideas and work styles of the revolutionary class and the Communist Party to serve the people; to overcome the bureaucratic and commandist work styles of deviating from reality and deviating from the masses, we must at the same time implement the work style of the mass line of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses. We must see that the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against punishment of law-breaking and discipline-violating is a long-term struggle, and we must never be complacent and paralyzed at any time. In the future, we must constantly improve the ideological level of cadres, and constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism. In the future, we must further strengthen the democratic life inside and outside the Party, promote the enthusiasm of the masses, rely on the supervision of the masses inside and outside the Party, and strive to purify, consolidate and improve the Party ranks, complete the national tasks of 1953, and lead the people's revolutionary cause to a new historical victory!

    坚决开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争
    中共中央山东分局第二书记　向明
    山东地区党的组织和全体人民，三年多以来，在伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席和中共中央及中央人民政府的正确领导下，并在中共中央华东局的直接领导下，胜利地完成了恢复和改造时期的历史任务。我们医治了日寇和蒋匪所造成的战争创伤，恢复和发展了工农业生产，争取实现了经济情况的根本好转，稳定了并初步改善了人民的经济生活，继续深入了人民民主革命的斗争，肃清了帝国主义、封建主义的残余势力，实行了新民主主义的社会改造，大大提高了人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，有力地支援了抗美援朝的伟大斗争，扩大了爱国人民民主统一战线，巩固了人民民主专政的政权，并从而创造了迎接国家大规模建设任务的必要条件。这是我们的伟大的、光荣的、正确的方面。但是我们绝不应该忘记：我们的工作还有许多缺点和错误，我们党的队伍中还存在着某些思想不纯、作风不纯和组织不纯的现象。党的队伍中这种思想不纯、作风不纯和组织不纯的现象，恰恰也就是我们工作中产生许多缺点和错误的重要原因之一。
    还在全国胜利的前夜，毛主席就在党的二中全会上指出：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。如果这一步也值得骄傲，那是比较渺小的，更值得骄傲的还在后头。中国的革命是伟大的，但是革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚，谨慎，不骄，不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们有批评和自我批评这个马列主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”我们应当头脑清醒地牢记住毛主席的告诫。向后看，三年多来，我们虽然前进了一大步，但是向前看呢？国家工业化的前途和社会主义的目标的实现，还有很长很长的路程。
    在我们国家经济恢复和改造时期，山东地区党的组织，根据党中央的指示，不断地进行了整顿党的队伍的工作。在一九五○年秋季，我们曾经在各级组织中进行以克服官僚主义和命令主义为重点的干部整风运动。自一九五一年十二月至一九五二年五月，我们曾经在县以上各级领导机关中，开展了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的“三反”运动。在“三反”运动的基础上，我们紧接着进行了各级机关的整党工作。在这一时期，农村整党工作，经过了第一批的典型试验和第二批的逐步展开，已经完成了和正在进行着二五六九个乡支部，一二九四个村支部。鉴于整顿农村党的基层组织是极为艰巨的任务，我们必须采取积极稳进的方针继续进行，争取在今年至明年上半年内，胜利地完成农村整党的任务。
    山东地区党的组织的状况，正如刘少奇同志在中国共产党第一次全国组织工作会议上所指出的：“在我们党内是存在着优秀的具备共产党员条件的大量的党员，这些党员继承着并且坚持和发扬着我们党的优良的传统。但是，在我们党内也还存在着以下一些党员：在这些党员中，一部分是不完全具备共产党员的条件、或有较严重的毛病、或者丧失了共产党员条件的人。这些人，是必须加以改造和提高才能作一个党员的。另一部分是不具备共产党员的条件、对党不起作用或作用不大的人。他们是一些消极分子。如果不加以教育和改造，他们是不能作一个党员的。再有是少数混入党内的各种坏分子。这些坏分子是应该立即清除出党的。”“在我们党的组织上所以存在这些问题的原因，除开前面所说的我们工作上的缺点而外，是还有客观的历史原因的。这就是说，我们党过去是长期处在分散的农村中，并且是依靠老区广大的农民群众战胜了反动派，老区党的组织和大多数党员，在战争中是尽了他们的努力并起了他们的作用的。又由于紧张的战争的环境，我们党也还没有来得及对他们进行系统的教育和组织上的整理。由于这种客观的历史情况，再加上我们在建党工作中的许多缺点，就使我们伟大的、光荣的、正确的党内，还遗留着或存在着以上一些问题。对于这些问题，我们现在必须认真地、谨慎地来加以处理。我们必须遵照刘少奇同志的这些指示认真地、谨慎地、有计划地、有步骤地去整顿党的队伍，克服党内现存的思想不纯、作风不纯和组织不纯的现象，克服党内各种消极的、不健康的现象。同时，我们还必须遵照中共中央一月五日和中共中央华东局一月二十九日发出的指示，并遵照在政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上毛主席和周恩来同志、安子文同志的指示，开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。
    我省区以上机关的官僚主义作风和区以下基层组织的命令主义作风以及部分干部的违法乱纪行为，在一九五○年秋季干部整风后，随着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的发动，在一九五一年内，虽然一度有所转变，但并未根本克服；且在一九五二年内又有新的发展。
    虽然自一九五二年县以上机关进行“三反”运动以来，机关内部的民主生活确已有所增进，领导与被领导的关系确已有所改善，广大干部的积极性觉悟性确已有所提高，贪污浪费现象确已有所克服，但由于没有深入检查工作，官僚主义现象却更有新的滋长。这一时期从省级到县级领导机关的官僚主义作风有以下几种突出的表现：
    （一）在布置工作时，不从实际出发，不调查研究下情，不适应群众的要求和觉悟程度，不顾及客观的可能性，而盲目地从主观愿望和单纯任务观点出发，偏重于交代任务，限定时间，追求数字，不偏重于交代政策，交代方法，交代作风。更坏的是不论什么工作，一律采用摊派任务数字的方法，逐级往下摊派。如打井、抗旱、推广斯字棉、植树造林、贷水车、贷肥料、存实预购、有奖储蓄、牲畜保险、推销书报等，有很多都是从省级有关业务部门盲目地层层往下摊派数字的。
    （二）在布置工作后组织执行时，不去进行深入具体的指导，不去掌握典型示范，不去深入下层检查工作，不能及时发现和纠正工作中的偏差。
    （三）在一项工作终结时，不去总结工作、教育干部，或者即使总结，也只是偏重于任务数字而不顾实效和后果的总结，没有着重进行关于政策作风的经验总结。
    （四）各级领导机关，特别是省级领导机关习惯于坐在机关里签署文件，发表格。去年一年省府每一个厅或局的单位，往下行文平均在三千件以上。如农林厅以厅的名义发了三千三百四十八件，以属下的局、处的名义发了七千七百四十二件。又如邮电局全年上下行文二万二千六百五十三件，仅济南市局为修换电灯线问题，就和省局往返行文八次之多。省级各部门滥发表格，甚至也有统计鸡毛的表格。据下面反映对付这些表格的办法是：“上面要，下面造”；“低头想，抬头数”。高密县五区西庄乡，每次统计都是由文书估计填写的。该乡干部夸奖这个文书说：“俺乡有个好文书，一闭眼，就出来数字了。”
    （五）省和以下各级领导机关的会议太多。有许多会议是不必要的，可以不开的，有许多会议虽然是必要的，但由于事前缺乏充分的准备，拖延浪费了时间。特别是省府各部门的会议，由于缺乏统一控制，有随便乱召开会议的现象。由于上面各级领导机关的会议太多太乱，下层组织也同样有这种现象。如一个村干部反映：“俺村有一天四帮人去乡开会：爱国卫生会、查田评产会、合作社扩大社员会、妇女工作会。回村开个一揽子会，六个人讲了四件事，咱讲咱的，群众困他的。”又如有的群众反映开会有五多：“讲话的人多，说的事多，开会的时间多，听会的人困的多，会上的事听不懂的多。”
    （六）从省以下各级领导机关，特别是省府由于缺乏强而有力的统一领导，各部门存在着政出多门的分散主义现象。有的部门甚至存在着严重的无组织无纪律的状态。再加以各个业务部门缺乏思想领导和政治领导，缺乏整体观念，存在着单纯业务观点，因此，各业务部门的工作，便产生了脱离中心任务的孤立主义倾向。下面的同志反映：“乱箭齐发”，“多头多脑”，“乱杆子捕头”，“中心不中心”，“上面是科学分工，区里是一起往下拥，乡里是乱呼隆”。这些话正是批评上级领导上的 “政出多门”的现象的。
    （七）省以下各级领导机关对干部的思想教育不够，了解、培养、挑选、使用干部上存在着很多缺点。特别是农村经过多次大批上调干部之后，没有及时提拔补充干部，而区级组织由于抽调整党干部离开本区参加整党工作队后，更形成组织极不健全和事繁人少的严重现象。
    （八）各级领导机关不研究下面的工作情况，不关心下级工作中的困难，不及时答复和解决下级所提出来的问题；不了解人民群众的情绪和疾苦；对坏人坏事熟视无睹，不加以惩治和处理；对好人好事不加以支持和表扬；对处理人民来信极不重视，采取“转、压、推、拖”的态度。全省去年上半年统计积压人民来信十万件左右，经一再督促检查处理，但还有许多机关迄今仍未注意这项工作。
    以上是我们全省各级领导机关官僚主义作风的主要表现。正如毛主席所指出的：“现在在不少基层组织和基层干部中存在着很严重的命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，这种现象的发生和滋长，是与领导机关和领导干部的官僚主义分不开的。”官僚主义是产生命令主义和滋长违法乱纪现象的温床。我省的实际情况完全证明了这个道理。因此要克服命令主义和违法乱纪现象，必须强调首先从反对官僚主义入手。
    正由于我们各级领导机关存在着这种严重官僚主义作风，再加以去年上半年县以上机关因忙于“三反”“五反”运动，未能深入下层指导和检查工作，机关“三反”结束后，去年下半年各个业务部门的工作任务一起“往下拥”形成“乱箭齐发”之势，任务繁多，下层某些干部错误地采取“三反打虎”方式进行工作，对基层干部教育不够，因袭过去战时工作方式，以及部分基层组织不纯等原因，所以在去年一年中，农村工作中的命令主义作风便有日益滋长的趋势。去年我们虽然曾经多次发出通报纠正，并一再督促处理人民来信，但因重视不够，抓得不紧，批判不严，特别由于没有强调首先从克服领导机关的官僚主义作风做起，更未进行深入检查，采取有效措施，故到目前为止，这种严重的命令主义现象，并没有基本的转变。
    这种命令主义作风，不仅仅反映在农村基层干部和基层组织中，而且不同程度地表现在各方面的工作中。例如邮电局和书店推销书报，银行推广有奖储蓄，合作社贷肥、贷水车、存实预购，农林部门提倡打井、推广斯字棉等项工作，都是从省级开始就采用层层往下摊派任务数字的方式。这和基层组织的命令主义作风不同之处，仅仅在于它不是直接往群众身上摊派。我们的领导干部，往往不分工作性质，不顾及时间条件，不顾及群众觉悟程度，不顾及客观可能性，不讲明政策和方法，片面地强调
    “这是上级的任务，非限期完成不可。”这实际上也就是一种命令主义作风。苍山县前县长张作臣动员干部强迫棉农拔小棉，提出了“晚强迫不如早强迫”的口号，这和苍山县委在多次干部会上片面地强调“不完成任务要以法律论处”的口号，实际上是相同的。所以反对命令主义作风，不仅应当首先从反对官僚主义作风入手，而且应当在反对官僚主义斗争的同时，去克服各级领导机关和领导干部的命令主义作风。
    为了有效地克服这种命令主义的恶劣作风，除了首先应克服我们领导机关的官僚主义作风，加强领导责任，改进领导方法，转变领导作风，并对这种命令主义的恶劣作风，切实加以批判和纠正以外，特别应当从积极方面反复地教育干部，提高他们的思想水平和政治觉悟，加强他们的群众观点和为人民服务的思想，使他们懂得说服教育群众的方法，学会善于依靠群众团结群众的群众路线的方法；从具体检查总结工作中，要用好坏两种典型实例，即群众路线和命令主义两种不同的方法所产生的不同的结果，去教育干部。我们基层组织中，存在着大量优秀的党员和优秀的干部，他们对人民的事业是抱有无限的忠诚，他们认真执行着毛主席的指示，真不愧为人民的勤务员。如费县大安乡乡长李瑞兰同志，广饶县五寨乡支部书记张连成同志那样密切联系人民群众事事走群众路线的模范党员和干部，是应当大大加以表扬，做为我们的党员和干部的榜样的。
    对于部分品质恶劣的少数干部，特别是对某些成份不纯的基层干部和严重的违法乱纪的坏分子，要分别几种类型，加以严肃的处理。
    第一种坏分子是阶级异己分子或蜕化变质分子。他们一贯假借职权，压迫群众，敲诈勒索，贪赃枉法，强奸妇女，为非作歹，无所不为。这种坏分子实际上已经成了新式恶霸。例如，济宁县八区康庙乡及该乡赵王堂村坏干部王书坤、王书申、孙士温，民兵王来均等都已经成了人民切齿痛恨的敌人。（该案处理经过见二月八日山东大众日报）
    第二种坏分子是打入我基层组织的反革命分子。他们篡窃领导，维护地主利益，破坏政策法令，主持或掩护反革命活动。例如，莱阳县下柳连庄反革命分子于显理、于显阳等篡夺操纵该村政权和人民武装，残酷压榨群众、乱罚粮款，持枪强奸妇女甚至强奸幼女，拷打、辱骂、关押、管制和残害军属、工属，被打骂、关押和管制的达十七户，被迫自杀的两人，被打致病而死的四人。（该案正在处理中）
    第三种坏分子是严重的反党反人民的官僚主义分子。他们利用职权，破坏人民民主制度，侵犯人民民主权利，压制批评，对批评者实行打击报复。例如，即墨县阴岛区前区委书记刘本德，受了该区前阳村前乡支部书记高会岭、前阳村农会主任王文满等的利用，在民主建政运动中，群众在酝酿选举自己的代表、撤换坏干部时，他竟纵容高会岭等向群众进行报复，纠集民兵、盐警武装，殴打群众两天两夜，被殴打的有一百三十八户，计一百六十多人。
    （该案处理经过载一九五二年八月二十五日山东大众日报）
    第四种坏分子是严重的反党反人民的命令主义分子。他们在工作中，不顾人民群众的利益，不顾党和人民政府的政治影响，一贯严重地强迫群众，违犯政策，给党和人民的事业造成严重损失。例如，苍山县前县长张作臣，一意孤行，在“清理棉田”中，不择手段，下令强迫群众拔除小棉，使七个区，十八个乡，七十五个村，一千三百六十户农民，四百九十余亩棉田被毁坏。（该案处理经过，载一月二十日山东大众日报）
    第五种坏分子是具有严重自私自利和剥削阶级意识而未经彻底改造或严重丧失革命立场的分子。他们假公济私，侵占土地改革斗争果实，强借白使不还，高利盘剥，无报偿地使用群众劳力，或恂情舞弊，丧失立场、包庇地主、放走反革命分子。例如新泰县南峪村代表区主任董玉彬在土地改革中霸占斗争果实地二亩，并以孬地远地换军属的好地近地，以押契地换群众的死契地。仅去年一年他就要群众为他代耕二百六十个工。又如，齐东十里乡支部书记张子敬窝藏一个反革命分子达三年之久，群众用匿名信告他说：“张子敬天天喊抓特务，他自己家里就藏着特务，为啥不抓呢？”
    对待这些违法乱纪的坏分子，应当和对待犯有一般的官僚主义和命令主义错误的人有严格的区别。犯有一般的官僚主义和命令主义错误的人多属于思想作风不纯的问题，应当采取教育改造的方针，采取批评和自我批评的方法，克服他们所犯错误；当然对其中屡教不改而仍坚持错误的，必须予以适当的纪律处分。但违法乱纪的坏分子则不单是思想作风不纯，而且是严重地反党反人民，严重地违犯国法党纪，因此，对于他们，必须按照国法党纪严予惩处。当然，对前述五种违法乱纪的坏分子的具体处理还应有所不同。对前第一、二两种坏分子，必须逮捕法办，按他们所犯罪行，予以刑事处分，从判处徒刑起一直到判处死刑，如系共产党员则应开除党籍；对第三、四两种坏分子中情节严重者，也应予以应得的刑事处分，如系共产党员也应开除党籍；对第三、四两种坏分子中情节较轻者，也必须予以应得的党内外处分；对第五种坏分子的处分，
    一般说应较前四种坏分子为轻，但侵占群众的土地财产必须勒令其退还，剥削群众的劳动代价必须予以偿还，如有刑事罪行，也应予以刑事判处，如系共产党员也应清除出党。
    我们过去在维护国法党纪方面是不够严肃的。我们有一些领导干部对待违法乱纪的坏分子，存有姑息纵容的错误思想。如在处理违法乱纪的坏干部时，常常借口“过去有功劳”“工作积极”而拖延不处理，或处理而宽大无边。我们应当认识我们的党是没有两种纪律的，对待普通党员应该从严处理，对待领导干部怎么可以从宽处理呢！同样，我们的国法也没有两种，对待普通人民应该从严处理，对待干部怎么可以从宽处理呢！在我们的一些领导干部中，还有另外的一种错误的认识，害怕严厉惩处违法乱纪的坏分子，会重复一九四八年春季对部分农村基层干部“搬石头”、“一脚蹬”的错误。这显然是没有正确地认识到那时候“搬石头”、“一脚蹬”的教训是在于：没有把基层干部中的命令主义分子与违法乱纪的坏分子分别对待，而一起“蹬下台”，因而对前者未采取改造教育的方针，失之过严；对后者未予应得的法律惩处，失之过宽。今天只要将前者与后者区别对待，就决不会重复过去“搬石头”、“一脚蹬”的错误。对待违法乱纪的坏分子的宽大纵容，便是破坏国法党纪的严肃性，便是对人民的残忍。我们各级领导干部必须转变错误观念，严肃党纪国法，严厉惩处违法乱纪的坏分子。
    目前官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，已经严重地危害着我们人民事业，障碍着我们各项工作的推行，压抑着人民群众的积极性，绞杀着各种革命组织的主动性，破坏着各级党组织、各级人民政府和人民群众的密切联系。无论官僚主义和命令主义的思想作风，无论违法乱纪的恶劣罪行，都是和无产阶级思想——毛泽东思想不相容的，都是和我们党的思想作风和光荣传统不相容的，都是和人民事业的利益不相容的。就其社会根源来说，它是反动统治阶级对待人民的反动作风——国民党对待人民的反动作风的残余在我们的党和人民政府内部的反映。我们必须动员全党和全体人民，向官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的坏分子进行持久不懈的斗争！
    为了进一步开展这一斗争，我们必须进行下列各项工作：
    一、要认真学习毛主席和党中央以及华东局的指示，认真讨论已经公布的突出的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的事件，结合着对自己地区自己单位所存在着的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的严重现象的揭发，提高干部思想认识。首先要克服对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象的严重程度及其危害性认识不足的偏向，这是当前在干部思想上的主要危险。但在克服了这种主要危险倾向后，又必须防止可能产生的一概否定、“一杆子赶”、不加分析区别、慌手慌脚、急躁情绪等。开展这一斗争必须掌握坚定不移、有的放矢、打中要害、逐步深入的方针。
    二、这个斗争必须结合各项工作来进行，绝不可脱离各项工作。开展这一斗争既不能抄袭去年“三反”的方式做为压倒一切的中心任务，也不可以
    “浮皮擦痒”和敷衍了事的态度去进行。要懂得执行工作任务和采用正确的政策、正确的作风、正确的方法本来是不能分开的，因此，在服从当前工作、抓紧当前工作、结合当前工作，并通过当前工作去进行这个斗争是最适当的。我们要在进行当前各项工作中结合进行整顿干部思想作风，善于去预防和杜绝官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象的产生。在每一项工作的布置中，要从实际出发，根据群众觉悟水平，充分估计到现实的可能性，并在交代工作任务的同时，强调地交代政策、作风、方法，绝不要单纯地追求任务、追求数字、追求时间。在每一项任务布置之后，要掌握典型示范的方法，深入检查，及时介绍先进的经验，及时纠正偏差。在每一项工作完成，总结时，要强调从完成任务的政策、作风、方法以及实效和后果方面去总结经验，教育干部。这就是说，开展这一斗争所采取的领导方针，应该是：一边要坚决反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象，一边要防止发生新的偏向，一边要加紧建设正确的思想作风，这样才能巩固斗争的成果。当然开展这一斗争，还必须进行一些专门的工作，如检查党委制的实行，有重点、有目的地检查和总结过去的工作，召开动员会，检查和处理人民来信，检查和处理违法乱纪案件等。但在进行这些专门的工作时，一方面必须在不打乱当前各项工作的条件下进行，一方面又要通过这些工作更好地去推动当前各项工作的进行。
    三、要开展这一斗争，必须善于运用批评和自我批评的武器，必须善于使自上而下的自我批评与自下而上的批评很好地结合起来。开展这一斗争，首先要有自上而下的自我批评，层层带动。各级领导机关和领导干部要首先检讨和纠正官僚主义作风，以推动下级机关和领导干部自觉地检讨官僚主义作风，以推动区乡下层组织和干部自觉地检讨和纠正命令主义作风，然后转入有领导地发动群众进行自下而上的批评，特别要通过处理人民来信，通过处理典型案件，发动广大人民群众，积极支持来自广大人民群众的自下而上的批评。对于压制批评、侵犯人民民主权利的反人民分子，应予以及时的惩处。在这里引用马林科夫同志的话是完全恰当的：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以消除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。必须使党组织和党的工作人员与我们的一切领导者领导这个运动，并树立正直地和诚恳地对待批评的榜样。”在运用批评和自我批评这一武器的时候，特别要抓住正确地运用党报和正确地处理人民来信这两个环子。要懂得批评和自我批评是开展这一斗争的大门，而运用党报和处理人民来信则是打开这一大门的钥匙。
    四、在开展这一斗争中，必须抓住重点，抓住典型，并通过重点和典型去推动一般。每一级领导上都应当抓住重点单位，每一单位都应当抓住重点事件和重点人物，以求通过这种重点去推动一般单位，教育一般干部。在抓典型方面，运动的前期，应着重抓住具有重大教育意义的坏人坏事，大力进行揭发和批判；运动后期，应着重抓住具有重大教育意义的好人好事，大力进行宣传推广。在这一方面，省级机关派出的检查组，应紧紧掌握重点办案、发动群众、推动一般的方针，报纸应认真组织报道，通过重点和典型进行宣传。
    五、通过整党建党工作结合进行反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、惩处违法乱纪分子的斗争，是更为重要的关键。根据已有的经验，农村支部整党，可以做到基本上纠正命令主义作风和消灭违法乱纪现象。在今后农村工作中，更应以开展爱国丰产运动与互助合作运动为中心任务，结合进行整党，而整党又以解决富农剥削思想倾向、纠正命令主义作风、克服违法乱纪现象为主要目的。今后在城市工矿以及农村晚解放区进行建党工作，也应紧密结合进行反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和惩处违法乱纪分子的斗争。
    六、通过各级人民代表会议和今后将要进行的普选运动及召开各级人民代表大会的工作，结合进行反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和惩处违法乱纪的斗争，是另一重要的关键。首先要通过乡代表会或乡代表大会、城市区代表会或代表大会，讨论处理一部分人民来信，凡乡或城市区代表会或代表大会不能处理或不应处理者，应提交有关机关或上一级代表会或代表大会处理。目前反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和惩处违法乱纪的斗争，也就是今年进行普选运动的准备工作。
    七、在开展这一斗争中，必须特别注意积极的思想建设的工作。要认识这是新旧两种事物的斗争，一方面“旧的不去，新的不来”，另一方面“新的不来，旧的不死”。要消灭旧的，必须建立新的去代替它，旧的固然不会自然死亡，新的嫩芽也不会不经灌溉培植而自然茁长壮大。在这一斗争中，必须明确地提出反对什么和提倡什么。要反对反动统治阶级的、国民党的反人民的反动思想作风，就必须同时提倡革命阶级的、共产党的为人民服务的思想作风；要克服脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义、命令主义作风，就必须同时贯彻联系实际、联系群众的群众路线的作风。必须看到反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和惩处违法乱纪的斗争是长期的斗争，在任何时候也绝不可自满麻痹起来。我们今后必须不断地提高干部思想水平，经常地展开批评和自我批评。我们今后必须更加加强党内外的民主生活，发扬群众的积极性，依靠党内外群众的监督，为纯洁、巩固和提高党的队伍，完成一九五三年的国家任务，把人民革命事业引向新的历史性的胜利而奋斗！
