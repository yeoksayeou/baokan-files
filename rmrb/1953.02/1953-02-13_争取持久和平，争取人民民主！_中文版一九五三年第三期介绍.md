The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, No. 3, 1953, has been published.

This issue, in commemoration of the 29th anniversary of Lenin's death, publishes an editorial entitled "Leninism – The Fighting Banner of the World's Working People," stating: For the people of all countries, Lenin's name has become a symbol of the new world. Leninism is a great internationalist doctrine. It lives in the steady progress of the Soviet people towards the road of communism, in the successful construction of socialism in the People's Democratic countries, in the establishment of a new life in the People's Republic of China, in the upsurge of national liberation movements in colonial and dependent countries, and in the growth of the world communist movement. Leninism lives and continues to triumph. It is the banner for the struggle for communism, a great ideological weapon for mobilizing the proletariat and all working people to carry out a resolute struggle against imperialism. The editorial then points out: The great party of Lenin and Stalin is an inexhaustible source of struggle experience and a model for the revolutionary actions of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. Lenin and Stalin constantly educated party members and all the Soviet people to have a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and a fiery hatred for the special agents, spies and traitors of imperialism. Leninism teaches us that complacency and paralysis are not allowed in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties, teaching us how to fight against opportunism and sectarianism, and how to constantly strengthen the ties between the Party and the broad masses of working people. The editorial emphasizes: To ensure that the Communist and Workers' Parties have invincible strength, it was, is, and will continue to be necessary to be faithful to Leninism, faithful to Lenin's doctrine, and to the great successor of his cause – Comrade Stalin.

This issue also contains articles commemorating the 29th anniversary of Lenin's death and news of people from various countries commemorating Lenin. The articles include: M. Mitin's "U.I. Lenin on American Imperialism" and "The Light of Lenin Shines on the Valleys of Romania" by Romanian People's Republic State Prize winner and writer Petru Dumitriu. Mitin's article, based on Lenin's works, discusses the nature of American imperialism, its emergence, its characteristics, and provides a detailed scientific analysis of its role in the general "bloody history of bloody imperialism" (Lenin), revealing the roots of the policies currently pursued by American imperialism. Mitin also analyzes the current economic and political situation in the United States based on Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Mitin said: Lenin, in his book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," pointed out the tyrannical, plundering, barbaric, and aggressive characteristics of American imperialism. Lenin's great historical contribution was that he was the first in the history of the working-class movement to expose the myth that the development of American capitalism seemed particularly "democratic" and "humane." Lenin pointed out that from the end of the nineteenth century, American foreign policy manifested its extreme aggressiveness. And the armed intervention in the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Republic, was the greatest and most shameful of all the bloody crimes of American imperialism. Mitin also said: Comrade Stalin's modern fundamental economic law vividly describes the economics and politics of the American imperialists. They try every possible means to obtain the maximum profit by plundering their own working people and the people of other countries. The American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in order to prevent the impending economic crisis and to orient industry towards fulfilling large military orders. The most important positions in the Eisenhower administration have been given to the largest American capitalists, which once again confirms the undeniable truth: the American government is a government of millionaires, for millionaires. Mitin concluded: Today, the ruling upper echelons of American imperialism continue to implement their shameful policy of aggression, pursuing the line of preparing for and launching a new world war. However, times are different today; if imperialism launches a new world war, the result will inevitably be the destruction of imperialism.

This issue also contains an article by Li Mo Wei, member of the Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, entitled "The French Communist Party Fights for the Unity of the Party Ranks." Mo Wei narrates the process by which the French Communist Party expelled Marty from the party, and analyzes and evaluates Marty's and Dijon's consistent disregard for discipline, engagement in sectarian activities, and other anti-party behaviors.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第三期介绍
    共产党与工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第三期已经出版。
    本期为纪念列宁逝世二十九周年，发表题为“列宁主义——世界劳动人民的战斗的旗帜”的社论说：对于各国人民，列宁的名字已成了新世界的象征。列宁主义是伟大的国际主义学说。它活在苏联人民向着共产主义大道的稳步迈进中。在成功地建设着社会主义的人民民主国家中，在中华人民共和国新生活的建立中，在殖民地附属国民族解放运动的高涨和世界共产主义运动的增长中，列宁主义活着并且不断取得胜利。它是为共产主义而奋斗的旗帜，是动员无产阶级和一切劳动人民为反对帝国主义而进行坚决斗争的伟大的思想武器。社论接着指出：伟大的列宁、斯大林的党是斗争经验取之不尽的泉源，是各国共产党与工人党革命行动的典范。列宁和斯大林经常教育党员以及全体苏联人民要有高度的革命警觉性，对帝国主义的特务、间谍和卖国贼要有烈火般的痛恨之心。列宁主义教导我们说，在共产党和工人党的队伍里不容许有自满情绪和麻痹大意，教导我们怎样跟机会主义和宗派主义作斗争，怎样经常加强党和广大劳动人民大众的联系。社论强调说：要保证共产党与工人党有不可战胜的力量，过去是，将来也仍然是，必须忠实于列宁主义，忠实于列宁的学说和事业的伟大继承者——斯大林同志。
    本期还刊载了纪念列宁逝世二十九周年的文章和各国人民纪念列宁的消息。文章有：麦·米丁的“乌·伊·列宁论美帝国主义”和罗马尼亚人民共和国国家奖金获得者、作家彼·杜米特鲁的“列宁之光照耀着罗马尼亚的山谷”。米丁的文章根据列宁的著作，论述了美帝国主义的性质、它的发生、它的特点，并对它在一般的“血腥帝国主义的血腥历史”（列宁）中的作用作了详尽的科学分析，揭示了美帝国主义现在所奉行的政策的根源。米丁并就斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”分析了美国当前的经济和政治情况。米丁说：列宁在他的“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”一书中，就曾指出美帝国主义横暴的、掠夺的、野蛮的和侵略的特点。列宁的伟大历史贡献就是：他在工人阶级运动的历史上第一个揭露了美国资本主义的发展似乎是特别“民主”和“人道”这个神话。列宁曾指出，从十九世纪末开始，美国的外交政策便表现出它的极端侵略性。而武装干涉世界上第一个社会主义国家即苏维埃共和国，是美帝国主义的一切血腥罪行中最大、最可耻的罪行。米丁又说：斯大林同志的现代基本经济法则生动地论述了美帝国主义者的经济和政治。他们千方百计地用掠夺本国劳动人民和别国人民的方法来获得最大限度的利润。美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，就是为了阻止即将到来的经济危机，使工业朝着完成大量军事定货的方向发展。艾森豪威尔政府中最重要的职位，都给了美国最大的资本家，这再度证实了一个无可置辩的真理：美国政府是一个百万富翁为百万富翁服务的政府。米丁最后说：今天，美帝国主义的上层统治者继续执行他们可耻的侵略政策，执行准备和发动新世界战争的路线。但是，今天的时代不同了，帝国主义如果发动新的世界战争，那么，结果必定是帝国主义的灭亡。
    本期还刊载了法国共产党中央政治局委员利·摩维的“法国共产党为党的队伍的统一而斗争”一文。摩维叙述了法国共产党将马尔梯开除出党的经过，并对马尔梯和狄戎一贯目无纪律、进行宗派活动等等反党行为作了分析和估计。
