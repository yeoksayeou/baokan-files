Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department's Experience in Establishing Responsibility Systems and Organizing Rhythmic Production
Ai Zhi

The establishment of responsibility systems and the organization of rhythmic production according to indicator charts have long been effective in general production departments. Similarly, these two advanced production management methods are of decisive significance for improving the work of design departments. The seven blast furnace system engineering design, completed seven months ahead of schedule compared to the original plan, with design efficiency one and a half times higher than that of the eight blast furnace design, is attributed to the establishment of responsibility systems and the organization of rhythmic production according to indicator charts in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department.

Establishing responsibility systems and organizing rhythmic production in design departments have many characteristics. According to the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department, to do this work well, one must first grasp the following three characteristics.

First, the design of a project often requires the participation of many professional technical departments. The work of these departments is both independent and closely linked. Obviously, it is impossible to do without someone to provide unified organization and leadership. Therefore, when establishing a series of responsibility systems in the design department, a system of overall responsibility must be established first. The overall responsibility system is not only one of the most important responsibility systems in design work, but also an organizational form that must be adopted in design work. Without it, the entire engineering design will inevitably fall into a chaotic state of disorder and loopholes. The reason why the design work of the eight blast furnaces did not proceed well was mainly because this most important link was not grasped, thus depriving the entire engineering design of strict unified leadership. As a result, the various professional departments were out of touch with each other. For example, department A's design was completed, but department B had not yet started; or the designs of both departments A and B were completed, but department A put the concrete foundation on the worker's entrance designed by department B. Errors like this, large and small, numbered in the thousands, and the time was dragged out for several months. The design of the seven blast furnaces proceeded better mainly because a relatively strict overall responsibility system was established.

Based on the experience of designing the seven blast furnaces, the most important thing to do well in establishing this system is to first clearly define the scope of responsibilities of the overall person in charge, the relationship with the relevant departments, and the main working system. Otherwise, even if there is an overall person in charge, it will not work. Generally speaking, without violating the relevant design principles stipulated by the higher authorities, the overall person in charge is the highest responsible person for the engineering design. From accepting the design task to completing the design, he has the right to arrange, inspect, and handle all issues related to the engineering design business. However, he should implement his leadership through the heads of the various professional design groups or the main design group. The working system of the design overall person in charge should pay special attention to two points: one is the reporting system for certain major issues; the other is the main steps and procedures of his leadership work. In the current situation where many leaders are not highly qualified, it is particularly important to clearly stipulate these two points.

Second, establish a strict review system. Design work is an extremely important and complex task. The state requires that the drawings used to guide construction must be one hundred percent correct, without any errors, not even a small size number. Obviously, without a strict review system, it is impossible to ensure that the design meets this requirement. The reason why the eight blast furnace design had eight times more errors than the seven blast furnace design is closely related to the failure to establish a strict review system.

In establishing and implementing the review system, the department's main experience is that design review work should not be concentrated in the hands of a few engineers. If it is concentrated in the hands of a few people, it will inevitably lead to blind signing and become a formality. Because a project has thousands of drawings, the review work is very heavy. Therefore, the principle should be to organize mass review. The experience of the seven blast furnace design review proves that it is very useful for all those involved in the design to participate in this work. A trainee technician can find principle errors in the design. The department now implements a level-by-level review system. That is, after the mutual aid groups (these are organized by the various professional groups in design units of one or several adjacent design projects) complete the design, they first review it themselves. After the mutual aid group reviews it, it is submitted to the review group specially organized within the professional group for review. The main content of the reviews in these two stages is: name, weight, drawing type, size, processing symbols, materials, safety, operation, calculation book, construction instructions, etc. After the review group reviews it, it is submitted to the professional group leader for review of major issues such as the connection between various designs. After the professional group leader reviews it, it is submitted to the overall person in charge for review. The main method for the overall person in charge to review the design is to convene the heads of the various professional groups together for a general review. After this review is completed, the entire design result is reported to all design personnel for a comprehensive report. Then hold discussions, review, correct, and pass.

It should be particularly pointed out here that the final review step is very important. In this mass discussion, many major errors in the design are often discovered. Because in the level-by-level review, most people are restricted by the scope of the review and it is not easy to find many problems. However, at the final review meeting, everyone involved in the design breaks through this limitation and gains the opportunity to consider and review the entire design. Many major problems in the seven blast furnace design were almost all discovered at this meeting.

In addition, in order for the masses to participate in the review work to truly play a role, all design personnel must understand the entire content of the preliminary design. Because if the masses do not understand the content of the preliminary design that has been approved by the state, they will have no way of understanding the state's basic requirements for the design, and of course they will not know whether the design is correct.

Third, the decisive link in promoting the organization of rhythmic production according to indicator charts in the design department is to mobilize the masses to find quotas and break through the old view that "design work has no fixed quota." Because without quotas, it is impossible to formulate a schedule, and if there is one, it is only a formality. Rhythmic production without a schedule is hard to imagine.

Design work quota work is indeed not as easy to set as general production. Because: 1. There has never been any quota for design work in China, only the start and end dates of the design. In the past, most designers had the habit of "do as much as you can!" "If you can't finish it by the time, postpone it!" 2. Design work is indeed more complicated, and quotas are indeed more difficult to find. However, this does not mean that it has no quota, or that this quota cannot be found. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department found this quota when designing the seven blast furnaces last year, and used it to organize a more rhythmic production, completing the design task ahead of schedule.

At least the following four methods can be adopted to set quotas:

(1) Investigate how much actual time was required to design the same project in the past; (2) Based on past experience, make a collective estimate of projects with different workloads; (3) Organize actual tests of various projects; (4) Refer to the advanced quotas of the Soviet Union. These four methods can be used at the same time. However, when using these methods, prevent the tendency of setting the quota too high or too low without starting from today's actual level. The method currently used by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department to set quotas is to mobilize the masses to carry out measurements, or to make reasonable estimates based on past experience. The quotas found using this method are often low in the initial stage, but do not immediately revise them. When the actual situation reveals this point to the masses, use facts to educate the masses and gradually revise them. Now the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Design Department is mobilizing everyone to find more advanced quotas through the quota summary of the seven blast furnaces. Because the facts have irrefutably pointed out to everyone that the past quotas were still a little low and should be raised further.

    鞍山钢铁公司设计处建立责任制及组织有节奏生产的经验
    艾直
    建立责任制与按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，在一般生产部门早已行之有效。同样的，这两个先进的生产管理方法，对于改进设计部门的工作，也有着决定性的意义。去年七号高炉系统工程设计，较原计划提前七个月完成了全部任务，比八号高炉的设计效率提高了一倍半以上，就是由于鞍山钢铁公司设计处建立了责任制与按指示图表组织有节奏的生产的缘故。
    在设计部门建立责任制与组织有节奏生产有很多特点。根据鞍山钢铁公司设计处的经验，要做好这一工作，首先应当抓住如下三个特点。
    第一，一件工程的设计，往往需要许多专业技术部门参加。而这许多部门的工作一方面是各自独立的，另一方面又是紧密相连的。很显然，在这种情况下没有一个人进行统一的组织领导是不行的。因此，在设计部门建立一系列的责任制时，必须首先建立总负责人制。总负责人制，不仅是设计工作中最重要的责任制度之一，而且是设计工作中必须采取的一种组织形式。没有它，整个工程设计必然陷于杂乱无章与漏洞百出的混乱状态。八号高炉的设计工作之所以进行得不好，主要的原因就是没有抓住这一最重要的环节，因而使整个工程的设计失去了严密的统一领导。其结果是各专业部门互不联系。如甲部门的设计已经完成，乙部门还没开始；或甲乙部门的设计都完成了，但甲部门把混凝土基础放在乙部门设计的工人出入口上了。像这样的错误，大大小小有数千处，时间拖长了好几个月。七号高炉的设计所以进行得较好，主要是建立了比较严密的总负责人制。
    根据设计七号高炉的经验，要把这一制度建立得好，最重要的是首先明确规定总负责人的职责范围，与各有关部门的关系和主要工作制度。否则纵然设有总负责人，也不起作用。一般说来，在不违犯上级有关设计原则的规定下，总负责人是工程设计的最高负责者。从接受设计任务到完成设计，他有权布置、检查、处理有关该工程设计业务的一切问题。但是，他应当通过各专业设计组的负责人或主体设计组实行他的领导。设计总负责人的工作制度应特别注意两点：一是某些重大问题的请示报告制度；一是他领导工作的主要步骤和程序。在目前许多负责人水平不高的情况下，明确规定这两点是特别重要的。
    第二，建立严密的审查制度。设计工作是一件极其重要而又复杂的工作。国家对它的要求是：拿去指导施工的图样，必须是百分之百的正确，不得有丝毫差错，那怕是一个小的尺寸号码都是如此。很显然，没有严密的审查制度，就不可能保证设计达到这种要求。八号高炉的设计错误所以比七号高炉多达八倍，与没有建立严格的审查制度有着重大关系。
    在建立与执行审查制度中，该处的主要经验是：设计审查工作不应当集中在几个工程师的手里。如果集中在少数人的手里，必然会形成盲目签字、流于形式。因为一个工程有上千张的图纸，审查工作是十分繁重的。因此，应当以组织群众性的审查为原则。七号高炉设计审查的经验证明：所有参加设计的人都参加这一工作有很大作用。一个见习技术员可以发现设计上的原则错误。该处现在实行的是逐级审查制。即：各互助组（这是各专业小组在设计时以一个或几个相近的设计项目为单位组织起来的）在设计完了之后，自己先审查。互助小组审查后再交专业组内特别组织的审查小组审查。这两段的审查的主要内容是：名称、重量、图型、尺寸、加工符号、材料、安全、操作、计算书、施工说明等。审查组审查以后，再交专业组长审查各种设计中间的联系等重大问题。专业组长审查完之后，再交总负责人审查。总负责人审查设计的主要办法是召集各专业组长在一起进行总审查。这种审查结束后，再把全部设计结果向全体设计人员作全面报告。然后举行讨论、复查、订正、通过。
    在这里应当特别指出的是：最后的一个审查步骤是十分重要的。在这种群众性的讨论中，往往发现许多设计上重大的错误。因为在逐级审查中，多数人受到审查范围的限制，不易发现很多问题。而在最后的审查会上，却使每个参加设计的人突破了这种限制，获得了考虑、审查全部设计的机会。七号高炉设计中的许多重大问题，差不多都是在这种会上发现的。
    除此之外，要使群众参加审查工作真正能起作用，还必须使全体设计人员都懂得整个初步设计的内容。因为群众不懂得已为国家所批准的初步设计的内容，便无从了解国家对设计的基本要求，当然也就不知道设计得是否正确了。
    第三，在设计部门推行按照指示图表组织有节奏生产的决定环节，是发动群众找出定额，突破“设计工作没法定额”的陈旧观点。因为没有定额，便不可能制定进度计划，要有也只是形式的。没有进度计划的有节奏生产是很难想像的。
    设计工作的定额工作，确实不像一般生产那样好定。因为：一、设计工作在中国从来没有过什么定额，只有设计的起止日期。以前的设计人员大都有“能干多少干多少！”“到时候完不成再拖期！”的习惯。二、设计工作的确比较复杂，定额也确是比较难找。但是，这决不是说它没有定额，或这种定额不可能找出来。鞍山钢铁公司设计处去年设计七号高炉时就找出了这种定额，而且运用它组织了较为有节奏的生产，提前完成了设计任务。
    现在起码可以采取以下四种办法来制定定额：
    （一）调查过去设计一项同样工程时所需要的实际时间是多少；（二）根据过去经验，对不同工作量的项目作集体估计；（三）组织各种项目的实际试验；（四）参照苏联的先进定额。这四种办法，都可同时运用。但是在运用这些办法的时候，应防止不从今天的实际水平出发，而把定额订得过高或过低的偏向。鞍山钢铁公司设计处现在订定额的办法是发动群众进行测定，或者根据过去的经验作合理的估计。运用这种办法找出的定额，在初期常常会低
    一点，但不要立即修正，等实际情况在群众面前揭破了这一点的时候，再以事实教育群众，从而逐渐地加以修订。现在鞍山钢铁公司设计处，正在通过七号高炉的定额总结，动员大家找寻更先进的定额。因为事实已无可争辩地向大家指出了过去的定额还是低了一点，应当再加提高。
