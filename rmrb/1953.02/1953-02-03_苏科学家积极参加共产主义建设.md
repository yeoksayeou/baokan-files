Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th: Under the unified leadership of the Commission to Assist Great Communist Construction Projects established by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet scientists are actively participating in the work of Soviet Communist construction projects and have achieved significant results. According to TASS news: many famous scientists and hundreds and thousands of researchers, graduate students, and university students from scientific research institutes have devoted themselves to this great patriotic movement. Academicians of the Academy of Sciences Khristianovich, Kulebakin, Ventzel, Zhudakov, Nalivkin, and many famous professors and Doctors of Science have also gone directly to construction sites to lead the scientific and technological cooperation between scientists and builders.

In 1952, Soviet Communist construction projects used more than 80 research results from the Commission to Assist Great Communist Construction Projects. Soviet scientists have researched methods for utilizing fine sand in concrete engineering in the Kara-Kum Desert. Now, not only in the Turkmenistan region, but also at the construction sites of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, the methods for using fine sand have been researched. Scientists have discovered high-quality stones required for the concrete engineering of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station in the Yablonovy Valley. They have also achieved great success in long-distance power transmission between Kuibyshev and Moscow. The recommendations made by scientists in rationalizing the welding work and artificial lighting of the foundation pit at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station are of great significance. Scientists have also made significant contributions to the establishment of automatic concrete factories. Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Sokolovsky created several new calculation methods for hydraulic engineering structures, and Corresponding Academician Kochina studied the process of salt dissolving and alkalization in living and dead water. Scientists have been successful in fundamentally improving saline soil to make it suitable for tree growth. The Soviet Academy of Sciences, in conjunction with the "Hydraulic Engineering Design Bureau" and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Cotton Growing Department, and the Forestry Department, have solved important issues regarding the distribution of irrigation systems in barren areas along the Caspian Sea, the Turkmen Main Canal area, and Northern Crimea. Scientists have also provided various assistance to engineering machinery and afforestation work in the desert.

Soviet scientists are deeply involved in working on construction sites. For example, the high-quality stones required for the concrete engineering of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, mentioned above, were discovered by scientists under the leadership of Professor Zalesky. The buildings, weirs, and sluices of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station project will require approximately seven million cubic meters of concrete in a short period, and this concrete must be of excellent quality. In order to supply high-quality stones, scientists carried out exploration work on the right bank of the Volga River using rational new methods, and as a result, discovered that the stones in the Yablonovy Valley could be used. Scientists have also signed cooperation contracts with builders. For example, such contracts have been signed at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Project construction site. Scientists and builders hold scientific and technological conferences. Scientists also give reports to builders on issues such as: "Comrade Stalin's brilliant work 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR,'" "On the Issue of Establishing the Material Basis of Communism."

In addition, Soviet scientists are also conducting work on great Communist construction projects in laboratories. The Institute of Mechanical Sciences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has invented instruments to determine the firmness of alluvial dikes and waterproof dikes, and is studying methods to solidify waterlogged loose soil. The Institute of Physical Chemistry has made great progress in studying the improvement of concrete composition and increasing its firmness, and is currently working with the Moscow Petroleum Institute to study new methods for mixing and pouring concrete in winter. The Institute of Mechanics and Telemechanics is manufacturing instruments for automatically calculating the work efficiency of excavators and dredgers.

The work of Soviet scientists on great Communist construction projects will be greatly increased this year. The work teams sent by the Academy of Sciences to various construction sites will actively expand their work. Theoretical research on important issues in hydraulic technology, hydroelectric power engineering, and transforming nature will be greatly strengthened.

    苏科学家积极参加共产主义建设
    【新华社三十日讯】苏联科学家在苏联科学院所设的伟大共产主义建设工程协助委员会的统一领导下，积极参加苏联共产主义建设工程的工作，获得了重大成绩。据塔斯社消息：许多著名科学家和成百成千科学研究所的研究人员、研究生、高等学校的学生，都投入了这一伟大的爱国主义运动。科学院院士赫里斯季阿诺维奇、库列巴金、文特尔、朱达科夫、纳利夫金以及许多著名的教授和科学博士，还直接到建设工地上领导科学家与建筑者的科学技术合作。
    在一九五二年中，苏联共产主义建设工程共使用了共产主义建设工程协助委员会的八十多种研究成果。苏联的科学家们研究出在卡拉·库姆沙漠中为混凝土工程利用细砂的办法。现在不仅土库曼地区，而且古比雪夫水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站的建设工地上使用细砂的方法都已经研究出来了。科学家们已为古比雪夫水电站的混凝土工程，在雅布诺内谷地发现了所需的优等质量的石头。他们还在古比雪夫和莫斯科之间远距离输电方面获得了很大的成就。科学家们在合理化组织古比雪夫水电站电焊工作和合理化组织对基坑的人工照明工作上所作的建议，有巨大的意义。科学家们在成立自动混凝土工厂上也作了重大的贡献。苏联科学院通讯院士索科洛夫斯基创造了水力工程建筑的若干新计算方法，通讯院士科钦娜研究了盐在活水和死水中溶解及其碱化的过程。科学家们在根本改善含盐土壤使它适合林木生长上已经得到成功。苏联科学院会同“水力工程设计处”以及苏联农业部、植棉部和林业部，解决了关于里海沿岸贫瘠地区、土库曼大运河地区和北克里米亚等地区灌溉系统分布的重要问题。科学家们还对沙漠中工程用机器以及造林工作，进行了种种援助。
    苏联的科学家们深入建设工地进行工作。例如，上面所说的古比雪夫水电站混凝土工程所需的优等质量的石头，便是科学家们在扎列斯基教授领导下发现的。古比雪夫水电站工程的建筑物、拒水堰和水闸在短期内就需要约七百万公方混凝土，这种混凝土必须质量很优良。为了供应质量优良的石头，科学家们在伏尔加河右岸用合理的新方法展开了勘察工作，结果发现了雅布诺内谷地的石头可以使用。科学家们还与建筑者们订立彼此合作的合同。例如，在古比雪夫水力工程建设工地，便订有这样的合同。科学家与建筑者举行科学技术会议。科学家也向建筑者作下面这类问题的报告：“斯大林同志的天才著作‘苏联社会主义经济问题’”，“关于创立共产主义的物质基础的问题”。
    此外，苏联的科学家还在实验室进行关于伟大共产主义建设工程的工作。苏联科学院机械科学研究所发明了确定冲积堤和防水堤的坚固性的仪器，并在研究使水多的松土结实起来的方法。物理化学研究所在研究改善混凝土的组成、增加它的坚固性方面有了很大的收获，现在正与莫斯科石油研究所共同研究在冬季调制和浇灌混凝土的新方法。机械与远距离自动操纵研究所正在制造挖掘机和汲泥机自动计算工作效能的仪器。
    苏联科学家关于伟大共产主义建设工程的工作在今年还将大大增加。科学院派到各建设工地去的工作队将积极扩充他们的工作。关于水力技术、水力发电工程和改造自然方面的重要问题的理论研究工作将要大力加强。
