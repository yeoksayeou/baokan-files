Xinhua News Agency: The Tibetan Delegation, led by Head Liu Xia·Tubudan Taba and accompanied by Peng Sike, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, returned to Beijing by train from Xi'an on January 31. Greeting them at the station were Ayesha, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, Ranba·Nangji Wangdui, Director of the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, Luo Wang, Acting Director of the Panchen's Office in Beijing, Lian Huizhu, Deputy Director, and representatives from the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission.

During their 21-day visit to Northwest China, the Tibetan Delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere. When the Tibetan Delegation paid homage to the Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai, the monks of the Ta'er Monastery welcomed the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni with extremely grand ceremonies. Led by the senior monk Guanqiao Bardan, representatives from all the monks of the monastery and units such as the "Xiezhi Buleng" (Scripture Hall), "Juba Zhacang" (Tantra Institute), Manba Zhacang (Medical College), and Dikeer Zhacang (Kalachakra Hall), presented "Dianjia" (gifts) to Liu Xia·Tubudan Taba and other leaders of the Tibetan Delegation as a sign of respect. The next day, Ulan Fattai of Ta'er Monastery personally led all the monks to the residence of the Tibetan Delegation to hold a prayer meeting, praying for Chairman Mao's longevity, the eternal close unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the great unity of the people of all nationalities in the People's Republic of China. On the eve of their departure, they also held a symposium. The senior monk Guanqiao Bardan of the monastery and others reported many vivid facts about the local people's government's protection and respect for freedom of religious belief and the property of the monastery after liberation, and expressed the hope that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni would be even more closely united so that the Tibetan believers could better enjoy the right to freedom of religious belief. Liu Xia·Tubudan Taba, head of the Tibetan Delegation, said: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are closely united, and our freedom of religious belief, like that in the interior, is respected and protected everywhere, so that we can come to the holy land of Ta'er Monastery. However, we should always be vigilant and prevent the imperialist elements from sowing discord.

    西藏致敬团访西北后回北京
    据新华社讯：西藏致敬团一行由团长柳霞·土登塔巴率领和中央人民政府民族事务委员会办公厅副主任朋斯克陪同，于一月三十一日自西安乘火车返抵北京。到车站欢迎的有中央人民政府民族事务委员会办公厅副主任阿艾沙，西藏达赖喇嘛驻京办事处处长然巴·囊吉旺堆，班禅驻京办事处代处长罗旺、副处长联慧珠及中央民族事务委员会代表等。
    西藏致敬团在西北参观的二十一天中，到处受到热烈的欢迎。西藏致敬团朝拜青海塔尔寺时，塔尔寺僧众用极其隆重的仪式欢迎了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的代表。全寺僧众及“协之卜楞”（讲经堂）、“居巴扎仓”（密宗院）、满巴扎仓（医学院）、迪科儿扎仓（时轮经堂）等单位代表，在大僧官官桥巴尔丹率领下，并向西藏致敬团正、副团长柳霞·土登塔巴等“典加”（献礼）致敬。次日，塔尔寺乌兰法台亲率全体僧众到西藏致敬团住地举行祈祷大会，祈祷毛主席万寿无疆，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼永远亲密团结，中华人民共和国各民族人民大团结。在临别前夕，他们并举行座谈会。寺院大僧官官桥巴尔丹等报告了解放后当地人民政府保护和尊重宗教信仰自由和寺院财产的许多生动事实，并表示希望达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼更加亲密团结，使西藏的教徒更好地享受宗教信仰自由的权利。西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴说：在毛主席、中央人民政府和西南军政委员会的英明领导下，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼亲密团结了，我们的宗教信仰自由，也和内地一样处处得到尊重和保护，这样我们才能来到圣地塔尔寺。但是，我们还应该时刻提高警惕，防止帝国主义分子的挑拨离间。
