    Seriously Sum Up and Promote the Experience of High-Yield Models
    The fact that the well-known cotton planting model, Qu Yaoli, has achieved yields of over 600 or 700 jin of seed cotton per mu for three consecutive years fully demonstrates that China's cotton planting industry, even under the existing technical conditions, can achieve stable and high yields on a relatively large area. It once again shows that the potential for increasing cotton production in our country is very strong. As long as we can sum up the experiences of Qu Yaoli and other cotton planting models and promote them in a planned way, China's cotton production will continue to increase by one or two times.
    In order to summarize and promote Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, we have done a lot of work. Over the past two years, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has repeatedly sent responsible cadres to Qu Yaoli's farm to inspect, study, and systematically summarize his experience. The Party and government leaders of Shanxi Province have also planned to promote his experience in cotton-producing areas throughout the province. Under the influence of Qu Yaoli's advanced technology, cotton farmers in many regions have continuously created new records of high yield. The national record of 1,021 jin of seed cotton per mu, created by the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, is a prominent example.
    However, on the other hand, judging from the fact that Qu Yaoli failed to complete his 1,000-jin high-yield plan last year, our research and guidance on the high-yield technology of such a national cotton planting model are still insufficient. The Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent a work team to live in Qu Yaoli's village, but there was no technical cadre in this work team; the Yuncheng Prefectural Farm did not regularly and systematically help Qu Yaoli. The Central Ministry of Agriculture did not assign anyone to provide him with regular technical guidance. Therefore, no one discovered and helped solve some of the shortcomings of Qu Yaoli's cotton planting technology in a timely manner. Here, we cannot help but ask such a question: For a high-yield model like Qu Yaoli, should we let him explore on his own, and then summarize his experiences and lessons after he has created experience or suffered failures? Or should we study his technology at any time and help him to continuously improve and enhance it? Undoubtedly, we should adopt the latter attitude. Only by truly delving into the production practices of high-yield models, studying their technology, and improving their technology, can we make their technology mature faster and better, and enrich our experience in technical guidance. We believe that from the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the leading organs of agricultural production at all levels should quickly send all kinds of agricultural experts under their jurisdiction to various well-known high-yield models to conduct research with them, combine their own science and technology with the practical experience of high-yield models, so as to quickly improve various high-yield technologies a step further.

### 认真总结和推广丰产模范的经验

    认真总结和推广丰产模范的经验
    著名植棉模范曲耀离连续三年获得每亩收获六、七百斤籽棉以上的产量的事实，充分说明我国的植棉事业，即使在现有的技术条件下，也完全可以在较大面积上得到稳定的、高额的产量。它再一次显示了我国棉花增产的潜在力量是十分雄厚的。只要我们能够把曲耀离和其他植棉模范的经验很好地总结起来，有计划地加以推广，那末，我国的棉花产量就会一倍两倍地不断提高。
    为了总结与推广曲耀离的植棉经验，我们曾经做了不少工作。中央人民政府农业部两年来曾多次派遣负责干部到曲耀离的农场，检查、研究和比较系统地总结了他的经验。山西省党、政领导方面也在全省产棉区有计划地推广了他的经验。许多地区的棉农在曲耀离的先进技术的影响之下，不断创造丰产新纪录，山西翼城县吴春安农业生产合作社创造的每亩产籽棉一千零二十一斤的全国植棉最高纪录，就是突出的例子。
    但是，另一方面，从去年曲耀离没有完成千斤丰产计划这一事实看来：我们对于这样一个全国植棉模范的丰产技术的研究和指导，还是很不够的。运城专署曾派了一个工作组住在曲耀离的村子里，但这个工作组中却没有一个技术干部；运城专区农场对曲耀离也没有经常地有计划地加以帮助。中央农业部也没有派定专人，对他作经常的技术指导工作。因此，曲耀离在植棉技术方面存在的一些缺点，也没有人及时发现并帮助解决。在这里，我们不能不发生这样的疑问，即对于曲耀离这样一个丰产模范，我们是应该让他自己去摸索，等他创造了经验或遭到了失败，然后再去总结他的经验教训呢？还是应当随时随地地去研究他的技术，帮助他不断改进、不断提高呢？毫无疑问，我们应该采取后一种态度。我们只有真正深入到丰产模范的生产实践中去，研究他的技术，提高他的技术，才能使他们的技术更快地更好地成熟起来，并能丰富我们在技术指导上的经验。我们认为，从中央农业部起，各级农业生产的领导机关，都应该把所属的各种农业专家，迅速派到各种著名的丰产模范那里去，和他们在一起进行研究，把自己的科学技术和丰产模范的实践经验结合起来，以便很快地把各种丰产技术提高一步。
