    Our Great Motherland
    Our people already have experience in conducting democratic elections. The representatives of the people's congresses at all levels in the vast majority of places are directly and indirectly elected by the people. Generally, more than 80% of the total number of representatives have been elected, and in some cases, more than 90% have been elected. This is the election scene of the first session of the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province.

    我们伟大的祖国
    我国人民已经有了进行民主选举的经验。绝大多数地方各级人民代表会议的代表，是由人民直接选举和间接选举的，一般都已达到了代表总数的百分之八十以上，有的已达到百分之九十以上。这是广西省桂西僮族自治区首届各族各界人民代表会议的选举场面。
