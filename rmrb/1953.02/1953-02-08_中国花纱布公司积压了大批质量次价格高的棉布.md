The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's branches in various locations currently have a stockpile of 1.39 million bolts of low-quality, high-priced cotton cloth, over 64,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and 50,000 cotton blankets, tying up 696.2 billion yuan in capital. The interest on this capital, warehousing rent, and transportation costs for these substandard products, as well as the losses incurred from selling them at reduced prices due to their poor quality, amount to over 43.2 billion yuan.

In the third quarter of last year, most regional branches of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company failed to meet their sales targets for cotton yarn and cloth. At the time, many people pinned their hopes on the fourth quarter, but sales of yarn and cloth remained sluggish. The head office organized inspection teams to visit various regions to understand the sales situation and the demands of the masses for yarn and cloth, and found that the main reason for the accumulation of most yarn and cloth was its poor quality and high price, which did not meet consumer needs. Some lower-quality fabrics could find some customers in remote rural areas if the price was low. However, these fabrics are not cheap either. Farmers compare the price of these narrow and dark-colored fabrics with the price of good fabrics, and find that the difference is not much, so they would rather buy good fabrics to wear.

It is a universally understood principle that good-quality, low-priced cloth sells well, while low-quality, high-priced cloth does not. Here, we can compare the Golden Star Blue Cloth produced by the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Industry Department in Shijiazhuang with the Flying Blue Cloth produced in Tianjin by dyeing Five Blessings Cloth: the dyeing labor cost for both blue cloths is 4,600 yuan per bolt. The Flying Blue Cloth dyed from Tianjin's Five Blessings Cloth has bright and vibrant colors, and sells very well at a price of more than 350,000 yuan per bolt. The Golden Star Blue Cloth from Shijiazhuang is dull and without luster, and even when sold at a price reduced by 11,000 yuan from the purchase price of 348,000 yuan per bolt, there are few buyers. Last year, the Hebei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's dyed fabrics of this type (including blue cloth and green cloth), in addition to those sold in the province and transferred to other provinces, still have a backlog of more than 45,400 bolts. The capital tied up in this batch of cloth is 69.74 billion yuan, and the interest expenditure alone amounts to over 214 million yuan. Another example is the New People's Cloth produced in Guangzhou, where the labor costs are too high, resulting in a cost of 291,000 yuan per bolt. Shanghai's Dragon Head Fine Cloth, when transported to Guangzhou, costs only 291,200 yuan per bolt. Shanghai's Dragon Head Fine Cloth is better than Guangzhou's New People's Cloth in terms of width, fabric texture, and density. Although the Guangzhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company sells Guangzhou's New People's Cloth at a loss compared to the purchase price, most consumers are still unwilling to buy it, resulting in a stockpile of more than 93,300 bolts in warehouses, tying up 27.187 billion yuan in capital. Similar examples can be found in various regions.

As people's purchasing power increases, the demand for varieties of cloth also increases. For example, rural farmers used to buy a few feet of coarse green cloth or a few feet of white cloth in winter because they had little money, and dye it with straw ash to make cotton clothes, as long as they didn't freeze. Now, many farmers' living standards have improved, and they want to use good cloth. This situation is particularly evident in cash crop areas. According to statistics from the Mengkeli Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province, from October 13th to 25th last year, the cooperative signed 228 purchase and sales contracts with farmers, selling 18,162 bolts of various cloths, mostly high-quality cloths such as green, gray, blue, and yellow twill, blue shirting, fancy serge, and green canvas, averaging 1.66 zhang per person; the sales of high-quality cloth increased by more than 17 times compared to 1951. In cities, the wages of workers and government employees are gradually increasing, and their demand for the quality of cloth is also increasing. The fact that the sales of high-quality cloth by the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company have increased year by year is a clear example. In 1952, the company's sales of blue twill cloth increased by 260.33 percent compared to 1951, sales of Tiananmen blue cloth increased by 59.92 percent, sales of printed cloth increased by 183 percent, and sales of fancy serge and fancy gabardine increased by 91.75 percent.

The people's demands for the variety and quality of cloth are constantly increasing, but the leading cadres of the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company have underestimated this situation. They still blindly entrusted the processing and purchased a lot of low-quality and high-priced cloth. For example, the East China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company entrusted the processing of a large amount of Chongming homespun last year, originally intending to sell it to Fujian, but the quality of these homespun fabrics was very poor and did not meet the needs of Fujian farmers. Therefore, 126,000 bolts of homespun have been stockpiled in warehouses for a long time, occupying 12.474 billion yuan in capital. A lot of this lower-quality green, blue, and white cloth is stockpiled in warehouses in various regions. For example, the "23" and "81" white cloth produced in Beijing have a backlog of more than 30,600 bolts. Beijing's Xinsheng and New China green cloth, because of their coarse texture and narrow width, are not popular with the masses and have a backlog of more than 31,000 bolts.

The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's blind commissioning of processing and purchasing has also fueled the blind development of small and handicraft weaving and dyeing factories. The number of small weaving factories in Beijing increased from 423 households with 1,332 looms in 1949 to 1,168 households with 2,860 looms in 1952, of which those processing for state-owned trade departments accounted for more than 80 percent of the total output. In 1951, Hubei River cloth had a total of 455 wooden looms, which will increase to 1,045 this year, all relying on the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to entrust processing. After these small and handicraft dyeing and weaving factories blindly develop, they push their low-quality and high-priced cloth to state-owned trade departments for stockpiling.

Many of the local Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies blindly commission processing orders and purchase substandard cloth because they are instructed by local finance committees and industrial and commercial administrative departments. The Hebei Provincial Finance Committee designated state-owned trade departments to purchase the Golden Star Blue Cloth produced by the Hebei Provincial Industry Department's factory in Shijiazhuang. Last summer, due to disasters in northern, eastern, and central Hubei, the Hubei Provincial Finance Committee led the production of disaster relief and instructed the Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to purchase a large amount of substandard cloth and homespun. These cloths were of poor quality and could not be sold, and are still stockpiled at 90,000 bolts, tying up 3.78 billion yuan in capital. The same situation exists in Guangzhou, Changzhou, Beijing, and other places.

In order to change this situation: 1. State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies in various regions should strengthen investigation and research, and do a good job in production and sales balance plans. They should not entrust small and handicraft weaving and dyeing factories to process products that are high in cost, low in quality, and do not meet the needs of residents. Because the result of blindly entrusting processing will make many small factories rely only on the state to process and purchase to maintain production, and they are unwilling to improve their operations, improve quality, and reduce costs. This not only ties up state funds, but is also detrimental to production and consumers. In the future, the production of yarn and cloth should pay attention to increasing variety, reducing costs, and improving quality; shoddy cloth is not suitable for the needs of the people. 2. Adjust weaving and dyeing processing costs. For example, the weaving labor cost in Guangdong Province is higher than in other parts of the country. Although the state-owned trade system sells at a loss, sales are still difficult. For example, dyeing labor costs in various parts of North China are relatively high, and should be appropriately reduced based on industrial costs and market conditions. 3. For the existing unsold low-quality cloth, the selling price should be appropriately reduced, actively opening up sales channels, and accelerating capital turnover, so that large amounts of capital can be used for national construction.

    中国花纱布公司积压了大批质量次价格高的棉布
    沈文英
    目前，中国花纱布公司各地分支公司积压了质量次、价格高的棉布一百三十九万匹，棉纱六万四千多件，棉毯五万条，搁置资金六千九百六十二亿元。因这些次品长期被积压而支付的资金利息、仓租、运费以及因质量次而降价出售的损失，就在四百三十二亿元以上。
    去年第三季度，大部分地区的花纱布公司没有完成纱布推销任务。当时许多人把希望寄托在第四季度，但第四季度纱布的销路仍不算好。总公司曾组织了检查组到各地了解纱布推销情况和各地群众对纱布的要求，发现大部分纱布积压下来的主要原因是由于质次价高，不适合消费者的需要。有些质量较次的布匹，如果价格便宜，在偏僻的农村中也能找到一些主顾。但是这些布也不便宜。农民把这些幅面既窄、颜色又暗的布的价钱和好布的价钱比较一下，发现相差不多，他们就宁愿买好布穿了。
    物美价廉的布是好销的，而质次价高的布则不会有销路，这是谁都明白的道理。这里，我们把河北省人民政府工业厅在石家庄设厂生产的金星蓝布，和天津出产的五福布加染成的飞行蓝布作一个对比：两种蓝布的染色工缴费每匹都是四千六百元，天津五福布染成的飞行蓝布颜色鲜艳发亮，每匹价格是三十五万多元，销路很好；石家庄的金星蓝布色暗无光，每匹照进价三十四万八千元降价一万一千元出卖，还很少有人买。河北省花纱布公司去年加染的这种布匹（包括蓝布和青布），除在本省销售和调运到外省去的以外，还积压四万五千四百多匹，这批布积压资金六十九亿七千四百多万元，只是利息支出即达二亿一千四百多万元。再如广州市生产的新人民市布，因工缴费太高，每匹成本要二十九万一千元，上海市的龙头细布运到广州每匹才合二十九万一千二百元。上海的龙头细布无论宽度、布纹粗细和密度都比广州的新人民市布好。虽然广州花纱布公司把广州的新人民市布按进价赔钱出售，但一般消费者还不乐意买，这样就使九万三千三百多匹布积压在仓库里，搁置资金二百七十一亿八千七百多万元。像这样的例子各地都有。
    人民购买力提高了，对布匹的品种要求也就增多了。如乡村农民，过去因为钱少，到冬天买上几尺青粗布，或者买上几尺白布，用谷草灰染一下做棉衣，只要冻不着就行。现在很多农民的生活提高了，都要用好布了。这种情况在经济作物区特别显著。据黑龙江省孟克里村供销合作社的统计：从去年十月十三日到二十五日十二天中，该社和农民订了购销合同二百二十八份，推销各种布一万八千一百六十二匹，其中多数是青、灰、蓝、黄斜纹、蓝士林、花哔叽、青帆布等上等布，平均每人买一丈六尺六寸；推销的上等布比一九五一年多十七倍以上。在城市里，工人和机关工作人员的工薪逐渐提高，他们对布匹的品质要求也提高了。北京市花纱布公司的上等布匹销量逐年增加的事实，便是一个明显的例子。该公司一九五二年蓝斜纹布销量较一九五一年增加百分之二百六十点三三，天安门蓝布销量增加百分之五九点九二，印花布销量增加百分之一百八十三，花哔叽、花贡呢增加百分之九十一点七五。
    人民对布匹品种和质量的要求在不断提高，而国营花纱布公司的领导干部对这种情况却估计不足。他们仍然盲目委托加工和收购了很多质次价高的布，如华东区花纱布公司去年委托加工大量崇明土布，本来准备向福建推销，但这些土布的质量很坏，不合福建农民的需要，因此有十二万六千匹土布长期积压在仓库内，占压资金一百二十四亿七千四百多万元。各地仓库内积压这种质量较次的青、蓝、白布很多。例如北京生产的“二三”“八一”白布，积压三万零六百多匹。北京市的新生、新中国青布，因质地粗糙、布面又窄，群众不喜爱，积压了三万一千多匹。
    花纱布公司的盲目委托加工和收购，也助长了小型及手工织染厂的盲目发展。北京市小型织布厂由一九四九年的四百二十三户、一千三百三十二台布机增加到一九五二年的一千一百六十八户、二千八百六十台布机，其中为国营贸易部门加工的占总产量百分之八十以上。湖北河布一九五一年共有铁木机四百五十五台，今年将发展到一千零四十五台，全部依靠花纱布公司委托加工。这些小型及手工染织厂盲目发展后，又把他们质次价高的布匹推给国营贸易部门积压起来。
    各地花纱布公司盲目委托加工订货和收购次等布匹，有许多是因为受了各地财委和工商行政部门的指示。河北省财委指定国营贸易部门收购河北省工业厅在石家庄建厂生产的金星蓝布。去年夏季因鄂北、鄂东、鄂中发生灾荒，湖北省财委领导生产救灾，就指示湖北省花纱布公司大量收购次布、土布。这些布质量低劣，没法推销，至今还积压九万匹，积压资金达三十七亿八千万元。在广州、常州、北京等地，都有同样情况。
    为了改变这种情况，一、各地国营花纱布公司应该加强调查研究，作好产销平衡计划，不应该委托小型及手工织染厂加工那种成本既高、质量又次、不合居民需要的产品。因为盲目委托加工的结果，会使很多小型厂只依赖国家加工收购维持生产，而不愿改善经营、改进质量、降低成本。这样不但积压了国家资金，对生产与消费者也是不利的。今后纱布的生产应该注意增加品种、降低成本、提高质量；粗制滥造的布匹，是不适合人民需要的。二、调整织染加工工缴，如广东省织布工缴高于全国各地，国营贸易系统虽亏本出售，但销售仍感困难。又如华北各地染色工缴费都较高，应根据工业成本和市场情况，适当降低。三、对现存滞销的质量次的布匹，应适当降低出售价格，积极打开销路，加速资金周转，使大批资金能用于国家建设。
