    Production Increases Year by Year, Life Gets Better Year by Year
    Fu Dong
    Before the Spring Festival, I visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the suburbs of Beijing. At that time, workers and their families were preparing for the festival.
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's employee consumer cooperative has eight stores. From February 7th, as soon as the cooperative stores opened, members buying things packed the stores full. The members at the back of the line waited anxiously, while those in front seemed to never finish buying. They bought chicken, but also wanted fish; they bought pickled mustard tuber, but also wanted dried shrimp, matsutake mushrooms, and tree ears...
    According to the comrade in charge of the factory's cooperative, they had prepared 14,350 bags of flour for the Spring Festival, and almost all of it was sold out in just two days, February 7th and 8th. Flour costing more than 80,000 yuan a bag, the workers asked to buy one or two bags as soon as they opened their mouths, and many bought three or four bags. A salesperson in the cooperative's grain department said that he had recently been transferred from the electric mill department that ground coarse grains. The electric mill department was established in 1949. At that time, workers mostly ate coarse grains, and the staff of the electric mill department were so busy that they couldn't catch their breath, while the comrades in the grain department who sold flour were very idle. In just three years, the situation had completely changed. Fewer and fewer people in the factory were eating coarse grains, and more and more were eating fine grains. The number of workers grinding coarse grains was reduced from eighteen to six. Recently, because coarse grains had no market, the electric mill department simply stopped work and transferred the remaining workers to the grain department to help sell flour.
    I walked to the cloth department of the second store and saw two workers each buying a whole bolt of blue cloth, happily squeezing out of the crowd. Another worker wearing a short coat was asking the salesperson, "Is there any better cloth?" The salesperson said that this kind of blue serge cloth was the best. The worker said, "Then I'll buy enough for a suit!" A worker's family member, while choosing cloth, said, "The cooperative's goods are still too few and not enough to choose from." A salesperson told me that last year, the members complained that the cooperative's goods were too few, so they organized member representatives to visit various department stores in Beijing, the Beijing Cooperative, and the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company. The member representatives looked at all the fabrics but were still not very satisfied. Before leaving, they said to the comrade in charge of the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, "You really don't have enough goods. I hope you can get more patterns." After returning to the factory, the cooperative increased the variety of fabrics to more than 200, including 40 varieties of floral fabrics, but the members still complained that there were too few patterns. The cooperative also processed a batch of fabrics themselves. The salesperson said, "Now the better the cloth, the faster it sells. The electroplated floral cloth processed by the cooperative itself sells as much as we have." The cooperative prepared 650 bolts of fabric of various colors before this year's Spring Festival, and they said it looked like it wouldn't be enough.
    At noon on the 8th, when the department store of the second cooperative store was about to close, I saw several worker comrades riding bicycles rushing over to buy Chongqing leather boots. The salesperson told them that the 50 pairs of newly arrived leather boots had all been sold out in less than two hours. They quickly asked, "Will there be another batch tomorrow?"
    The cooperative's meat department had too many customers and the room was too crowded, so they moved the transactions to the open space outside the room. According to the person in charge of the meat department, they prepared 37,000 jin of pork, 1,600 jin of mutton, 3,000 jin of beef, 800 fish, and 500 chickens for this year's Spring Festival; while last year they only prepared 10,188 jin of pork. The cooperative's food department prepared 15,000 jin of oranges and 10,000 jin of apples for this year's Spring Festival. This batch of fruit was five times more than what was prepared for last year's Spring Festival, but they were still worried that supply would not meet demand.
    The large glass cabinet for displaying pastries in the cooperative was almost empty all day. The pastries were often sold out before they could even be placed in the glass cabinet. The pastries made by the cooperative itself were not enough to sell, and they also purchased a batch from the city every day, but it was still not enough. Indeed, the workers' purchasing power has significantly increased this year compared to last year. According to the comrade in charge of the cooperative, in the seven days before the Spring Festival last year, the cooperative sold a total of 783.179 million yuan, while this year, on February 7th alone, it sold 398.8 million yuan. At that time, they estimated that they could sell at least 2 billion yuan in the seven days before this year's Spring Festival.
    Why has the workers' purchasing power increased? Everyone understands that under the New Democratic system, due to the workers' hard work, production has increased, and the workers' income has increased accordingly, so purchasing power has also increased. The work and life of labor model Li Jinquan vividly illustrate this point. Li Jinquan's wife told me: During the Spring Festival of 1949, if the People's Liberation Army had not arrived at the factory and distributed meat, cabbage, millet, and white flour to each family, the whole family would have still been staring at the empty pot in desperation, just like in previous years. During the Spring Festival of 1950, the factory's production had been largely restored. Not only did their family have money to buy white rice and white flour, but they also planned to make a cotton coat for Li Jinquan. However, Li Jinquan was busy manufacturing pig iron welding rods and mild steel welding rods at that time. He used all the money he had prepared for the cotton coat to buy materials for testing welding rods. Every day after work, he would go home to do experiments, and the whole family would sometimes stay up all night helping him pound medicine and dry the welding rods. The experiment was finally successful, which not only solved the difficulties in production but also saved the country a large amount of wealth. Just by utilizing the original three tons of waste welding rods, the country saved 28,000 jin of millet. During the Spring Festival of 1951, Li Jinquan had become a national labor model and received a lot of bonuses. That Spring Festival was really happy. The whole family bought five jin of pork, a few jin of fish, and dry vermicelli. Li Jinquan and the children also put on new clothes. Several little children were so happy wearing new clothes that they jumped around inside and outside the house. Later, Li Jinquan improved the mild steel welding rods, and the quality was better than the American Lincoln brand welding rods, and the cost was four-fifths cheaper than the American goods. Li Jinquan's self-made medium carbon steel welding rods can not only weld springs and floorboards but also weld turbine blades on airplanes, tanks, and motors. The better he produced, the more wages he got, and the richer his life became. On May Day in 1952, Li Jinquan bought a bicycle, and everyone in the family put on new uniforms. In winter, everyone made new cotton clothes. This Spring Festival, in addition to buying white flour, rice, pork, fish, and duck, they also wanted to buy a red wool scarf for their eldest daughter and some new books for their eldest son.
    Liang Fuzheng, who had just been promoted from worker to engineer, could earn more than 800,000 yuan a month (excluding bonuses). The family of six was living better and better. During the Spring Festival of 1950, they bought a bag of flour, two jin of meat, and a few jin of cabbage. During the Spring Festival of 1951, they bought a bag of flour, more than ten jin of meat, and the adults and children also added new clothes. On January 1st of this year, they had just bought two bags of flour and hadn't finished eating them yet. Before the Spring Festival, they bought two more bags of flour, 40 jin of rice, 50 jin of cabbage, more than ten jin of meat, three jin of sesame oil, several boxes of biscuits, and some candies. In terms of clothing, each of the three children made a suit of floral serge lined clothes; a leather jacket and a blue cloth short coat were made for the old mother; he and his wife each made a single uniform, and a new cotton quilt was also made. The remaining 300,000 yuan was deposited in the People's Bank.
    What about the lives of ordinary workers? Guo Kun, a third-grade worker in the iron-smelting air blower section, can earn more than 600,000 yuan a month (excluding various bonuses). Third-grade workers are the lowest level among skilled workers, but they are also well-fed and clothed. He bought four bags of flour at once this Spring Festival. Guo Kun's wife is busy sewing new cotton clothes, and the four school-age children are all on vacation. They are dressed very neatly. It is said that everyone has a new set of clothes and a pair of new shoes in their trunks, ready to be taken out and worn on the Spring Festival.
    Liu Shitian, the driver of the second boiler room in the power department, is a fourth-grade worker. His monthly wage is 220 points. Including processing fees, he can earn more than 600,000 yuan a month. There are also bonuses. His family of six is doing well. They are well-fed and clothed, and they have also bought a radio, a watch, and a clock. He also prepared a lot of money to buy meat and vegetables for this Spring Festival.
    All the staff and workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are working hard to complete the basic construction tasks assigned to them by the state in 1953, and to complete the production plan tasks of improving product quality, increasing output, and reducing costs in 1953. They know that if they complete the state's tasks well, the lives of them and the people of the whole country will become even better.

    生产一年比一年高，生活一年比一年好
    傅冬
    春节前，我访问北京市郊的石景山钢铁厂，这时工人和家属们正在备办节货。
    石景山钢铁厂的职工消费合作社有八个门市部。从二月七日那天起，合作社门市部只要一开门，买东西的社员们便把门市部挤得满满的。排在队伍后面的社员等得很焦急，而排在前面的人却好像总是买不完似的，他买了鸡，还要买鱼，买了榨菜，还要买海米、松花和木耳，……。
    据该厂合作总社的负责同志说，他们为过春节准备的一万四千三百五十袋面粉，只二月七日、八日两天就差不多卖完了。八万多元一袋的面粉，工人们一开口就要买一袋两袋，买三、四袋的也不少。合作社食粮部的一个售货员说，他是新近由磨粗粮的电磨部调来的。电磨部是一九四九年成立的，那时工人们多吃粗粮，电磨部的工作人员一天忙得喘不过气，而当时食粮部卖面粉的同志却很清闲。仅仅过了三年，情况就完全变了样。厂里吃粗粮的人越来越少，吃细粮的人越来越多，磨粗粮的工人由十八人减到六人，最近因为粗粮没有销路，电磨部索兴不开工了，把剩下的工人都调到食粮部来帮助卖面粉。
    我走到第二门市部的布匹部，看见有两位工人各买了一整匹蓝布，高高兴兴地从人群中挤出来。另一位穿着短大衣的工人正在问售货员：“还有更好的布没有？”售货员说这种蓝咔叽布就是最好的了。这位工人说：“那么就买一套衣服料子吧！”一位工人家属一面选布一面说：“合作社的货色还是太少，不经挑。”一个售货员对我说，去年社员们嫌合作社的货色少，就组织社员代表到北京城里各个百货公司、北京市合作总社和中国花纱布公司参观了一次。社员代表看了所有的布，还是不很满意，临走时对花纱布公司的负责同志说：“你们的货色实在太少了。希望你们多搞些花样。”回厂后合作社就把布匹的品种增加到二百多种，其中花布的品种增加到四十种，但社员们还是嫌花样少。合作社还自己加工一批布匹。售货员说：“现在是越好的布越卖得快，合作社自己加工的电镀花布，有多少卖多少。”合作社今年春节前准备了各色布六百五十匹，他们说看样子不够卖。
    八日中午，合作社第二门市部百货部快下班的时候，我看见几个工人同志骑着自行车匆匆赶来要买重庆皮靴。售货员告诉他们，新到的五十双皮靴，不到两个钟头就统统卖完了。他们连忙问道：“明天能来一批吗？”
    合作社的肉食部主顾太多，屋子里挤不下，就搬到房外的空地上来交易。据肉食部的负责人说，今年春节准备了三万七千斤猪肉、一千六百斤羊肉、三千斤牛肉、八百条鱼、五百只鸡；而去年仅仅准备了一万零一百八十八斤猪肉。合作社食品部今年春节准备了一万五千斤橘子，一万斤苹果，这批水果比去年春节所准备的多了五倍，但他们还耽心供不应求。
    合作社装点心的大玻璃橱几乎整天是空的。点心常常还没有摆进玻璃橱就卖完了。合作社自己作的点心不够卖，每天还到城里采购一批，还是不够卖。的确，工人们的购买力今年比去年有显著提高。据合作社的负责同志谈：去年春节前七天当中，该社一共卖了七亿八千三百一十七万九千元，而今年只二月七日那一天就卖了三亿九千八百八十万元。他们当时预计今年春节前七天中至少可卖二十亿元。
    工人们的购买力为什么提高了呢？谁都明白，在新民主主义制度下，由于工人们辛勤努力，使生产提高了，工人们的收入随着增加了，所以购买力也就提高了。劳动模范李金泉的工作和生活就突出地说明了这个问题。李金泉的妻子对我说：一九四九年的春节，要不是人民解放军到了工厂，给每家发了肉、白菜、小米和白面，那全家老小一定还是像往年一样，大眼瞪小眼，望着空锅干着急。一九五○年过春节时，厂里的生产已经大致恢复了，他们家里不但有钱买白米白面，而且打算给李金泉作一身棉衣了；但李金泉那时正忙着制造生铁焊条和软钢焊条，他把准备作棉衣的钱统统买了试制焊条的材料。每天下班，他就回家作试验，全家老小有时也整夜不睡地帮他捣药，晾焊条。试验终于成功了，不但解决了生产中的困难，而且给国家节约了大批财富。单是利用原有三吨废焊条，就给国家节省了二万八千斤小米。一九五一年过春节，李金泉已当了全国劳动模范，得到了不少奖金。那年春节过得真开心，全家买了五斤猪肉，几斤鱼和干粉。李金泉和孩子们还换上了新衣。几个小孩子穿着新衣服高兴得屋里屋外直蹦。后来，李金泉又改进了软钢焊条，质量比美国林肯牌的焊条好，成本比美国货便宜五分之四，李金泉自制的中炭钢焊条，不但可以焊接弹簧、道板，而且能焊飞机、坦克、电动机上的汽叶子。他生产好，工资就拿得多，生活也就越过越富裕。一九五二年“五一”节，李金泉买了一辆自行车，全家每个人都换上新制服，到冬天每人又做了新棉衣。今年春节，他们全家除了买白面、大米、猪肉、鱼和鸭子而外，还要给大女孩买红毛绒围巾，给大男孩买些新书。
    刚由工人提升为工程师的梁福正，一个月能拿八十多万元（不包括奖金）。全家六口人，光景越过越好。一九五○年春节，他们买了一袋面，二斤肉，几斤白菜。一九五一年春节买了一袋面，十多斤肉，大人孩子还添了新衣服。今年一月一日，他们刚买了两袋面还没吃完，春节前又买了两袋面、四十斤大米、五十斤白菜、十几斤肉、三斤香油、几盒饼干和一些糖果。在衣着方面，三个小孩每人作了身花哔叽夹衣；给老母亲做了一件皮袄、一件蓝布短罩衣；他夫妇俩一人做一身单制服，另外还做了床新棉被。剩下的三十万元，存入人民银行了。
    普通工人的生活怎么样呢？炼铁送风机三级工人郭崑，每月能得六十多万元工资（各种奖金不包括在内），三级工人是技术工人中最低的一级，但他也是足衣足食。今年春节一下子就买了四袋面粉。郭崑的妻子正在忙着缝新棉衣，四个上学的小孩子都放假了，他们穿得很整齐。据说箱子里每人还有一身新衣服和一双新鞋子，准备春节那天取出来穿。
    动力部二锅炉房司机刘世田，是四级工人，他每月的工资是二百二十分。把加工费合在一起，他每月可以收入六十多万元。另外还有奖金。他一家六口过得挺好。他们足衣足食，还买了收音机、手表和钟。今年春节他也准备了不少钱买肉买菜。
    石景山钢铁厂的全体职工正在为努力完成国家交付给他们的一九五三年的基本建设任务，为完成一九五三年提高产品质量、产量，降低成本的生产计划任务而奋斗。他们知道，很好地完成了国家的任务，他们和全国人民的生活，是会更加美好起来的。
