Northeast China is carrying out work to pilot five thousand agricultural production cooperatives this year.

Last year, the entire Northeast region piloted 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives. With the exception of a few that suffered severe natural disasters, the vast majority of these agricultural production cooperatives produced more grain than local mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and they cultivated core personnel and accumulated experience in management for the continued piloting of agricultural production cooperatives. Mutual aid teams with a relatively good foundation in various areas gradually dispelled various doubts after seeing the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives over the past year, and actively requested the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, at the Rural Work Conference held by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in November of last year, it was decided that in 1953, the entire region would continue to pilot 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of consolidating the existing 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives; and would begin to shift from key pilot projects led by counties to universal pilot projects led by districts.

In order to implement the guiding principle of "active leadership, steady progress," the leading organs of each county and district strictly and conscientiously reviewed various conditions such as the history of each mutual aid team requesting the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative, the number of party members and activists, and organizational labor and management capabilities. As a result, those approved to establish cooperatives were the best mutual aid teams in the local area. For example, among the more than 50 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Shulan County, Jilin Province, many had requested to establish cooperatives in the spring of last year, but were not approved at the time because they did not meet the conditions. After a year of hard work, they now meet the conditions for establishing cooperatives.

Currently, mutual aid teams in various parts of Northeast China that are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives are specifically discussing issues such as shareholding and distribution in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Agricultural production cooperatives that have been formally established are developing production increase plans. It is estimated that the unit area yield of cultivated land in the more than 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives piloted in Heilongjiang Province this year will be 20% to 30% higher than that of local mutual aid teams, and 20% of the land will create high yields.

Some problems have also occurred in the work of piloting agricultural production cooperatives this year. This is mainly because some county and district cadres and peasant activists have anxious and rash emotions. Cadres and activists in some areas ignored the private ownership foundation of agricultural production cooperatives and the traditional private ownership habits of farmers, excessively advocating public ownership of the means of production, or excessively restricting the remuneration that should be obtained for the means of production, thus affecting the enthusiasm of farmers to join the cooperatives. In addition, some cadres and activists, disregarding the existing foundation, blindly pursued quantity and scale. For example, some organized "large-scale cooperatives" of 40 to 50 households, or even 100 to 200 households, at once; some spent too much on buying vehicles and horses and building houses in the accumulation of public property; some looked down on agriculture and blindly set up sideline stalls, adding vehicles and buying horses to engage in transportation, opening flour mills, tofu workshops, brick and tile kilns, etc.; and some simply pursued "collective forms" and uniformly planned the living details of each cooperative member.

All these deviations have been promptly corrected by the Party and government leading organs in various places through effective measures. Many provinces, counties, and districts have convened working conferences on agricultural production cooperatives to repeatedly educate cadres and activists on the nature, guiding principles, and methods of piloting agricultural production cooperatives. When convening work conferences on establishing cooperatives, most invited the directors of agricultural production cooperatives that had achieved success in piloting last year to report on their experiences and lessons learned, which played a significant role in overcoming the tendency to be greedy for quantity and rashly advance. Many counties also organized activists from the new cooperatives to study methods of organizing labor such as the contract system and the individual piecework system, as well as to promote the experience of high yields in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. Some counties also held accounting training classes to solve the problem of agricultural production cooperatives needing accounting personnel. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北计划今年试办五千个农业生产合作社
    现正依照“积极领导、稳步前进”方针展开试办工作
    东北农村今年试办五千个农业生产合作社的工作正在进行。
    去年，东北全区已试办了一千二百个农业生产合作社。这些农业生产合作社除个别遭受严重自然灾害的以外，绝大部分都比当地互助组和个体农民多打了粮食，并且为继续试办农业生产合作社培养了骨干和积累了经营管理的经验。各地基础较好的互助组，因为在去年一年中看到了农业生产合作社的好处，逐渐打消了各种疑虑，积极要求成立农业生产合作社。因此，中共中央东北局在去年十一月召开的农村工作会议上决定：一九五三年全区在巩固现有的一千二百个农业生产合作社的基础上，继续试办五千个农业生产合作社；并在由县领导重点试办的基础上，开始转为由区领导普遍试办。
    各县、区领导机关为贯彻“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，严格而认真地审查了各个请求成立农业生产合作社的互助组的历史、党员和积极分子数量、组织劳动和经营能力等各种条件。因而，被批准建社的都是当地最好的互助组。如吉林省舒兰县新成立的五十多个农业生产合作社中，有许多是去年春天就要求建社，但因当时不够条件没被批准的，经过一年的努力，已经具备了建社条件。
    目前东北各地准备成立农业生产合作社的互助组正在自愿互利的原则下，具体讨论入股、分配等问题；已经正式成立的农业生产合作社，正在制订增产计划。预计黑龙江省今年试办的一千多个农业生产合作社，耕地的单位面积产量都将比当地的互助组高百分之二十到三十，其中百分之二十的土地将创造高额产量。
    在今年试办农业生产合作社的工作中，也曾经发生一些问题。这主要是部分县、区干部和农民积极分子存在着急躁冒进的情绪。有些地区的干部和积极分子忽视农业生产合作社的私有基础和农民传统的私有习惯，过高地提倡生产资料公有，或过低地限制生产资料应取得的报酬，因而影响了农民入社的积极性。另有部分干部和积极分子，不顾现有基础，盲目地贪多求大。如有的一下组织起四五十户，甚至一二百户的“大型社”；有的在积累公共财产上过多地买车马、盖房子；有的轻视农业，盲目摆副业摊子，添车买马大搞运输，开粉房、豆腐房、砖瓦窑等等；有的更单纯追求“集体形式”，统一计划每户社员的生活细节。
    所有这些偏向，都已经各地党、政领导机关采取有效措施，及时纠正。许多省、县、区都召开了农业生产合作社工作会议，对干部和积极分子反复进行了关于农业生产合作社的性质和试办的方针、方法的教育。各地召开建社工作会议时，大都邀请去年试办有成绩的农业生产合作社主任来报告经验教训，这对克服贪多冒进偏向起了很大作用。许多县还组织新社的积极分子研究包工制、个人计件制等组织劳动的办法以及推广黑龙江省肇源县丰产经验等问题。有的县并举办会计训练班，解决农业生产合作社需要会计人员的问题。  （新华社）
