The CCP Tianzhu Village Branch Rectifies Compulsory Commandism During Party Consolidation
The CCP Shunyi County Tianzhu Village Branch was established in 1945 and currently has 34 party members. Over the past few years, this branch has done a lot of work for the Party and the people. However, some party members, due to their low class consciousness and lack of methods in their work, did not patiently and repeatedly conduct propaganda and education among the masses when carrying out their work. Instead, they adopted compulsory command methods. For example, during the spring drought resistance and well-digging this year, they allocated funds according to the amount of land and forced over one hundred households to dig a well together. Similarly, when promoting prize-bearing savings, although they claimed it was voluntary subscriptions, they predetermined the number that had to be subscribed in advance. Some party member cadres even beat and tied up people. Li Kun, the former militia company leader, beat people sixteen times. This seriously affected the relationship between the Party and the masses and the implementation of the Party's and the government's rural policies.

During this Party consolidation study, attention was paid to conducting mass line education. At the beginning of the education, most party members believed that the masses were backward and that they had to be forced a little, especially those party members who had a compulsory command style, and they resisted. For example, militia deputy company leader Zhang Yucai said, "Without compulsory commands, we can't do anything." Village Chief Zhao Xizhen said, "The mass line works in other villages, but it doesn't work in our village." Li Kun said, "Compulsory commands are to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities and should not be regarded as the fault of party member cadres." Some who had been punished for beating and tying up people complained behind their backs. Obviously, these erroneous statements were mainly because party members did not sufficiently recognize the harm of compulsory commandism. At the same time, because they could not find a good working style to replace compulsory commandism before their ideological understanding was improved, they believed that this was the only good method. Therefore, to solve this problem, we must first help everyone deeply understand why compulsory commandism is wrong and what kind of working style is a good working style. Only by solving this problem can we mobilize party members to consciously criticize compulsory commandism. Based on the above situation, when the work team lectured on the seventh article of the party member standards, it focused on explaining that Communist Party members should have a democratic style, consult with the masses on matters, and conduct propaganda and education in their work. It is absolutely not allowed to use compulsory command methods. Because compulsory commands will turn things that the masses are happy to do into things that the masses are unwilling to do, turn good things into bad things, and cause the Party to suffer losses and become detached from the masses. Beating and scolding people is a violation of human rights and a violation of laws and disciplines, and it is not the style of a Communist Party member. In the lectures, examples of compulsory commandism in the village were also combined to illustrate the harms of compulsory commandism in all aspects. After the lectures, the work team guided everyone to summarize several tasks in the village that had not been done well due to compulsory commandism. For example, giving vaccinations to the masses was originally a good thing, but it caused dissatisfaction among the masses because compulsory commands were used. Another example is mobilizing the masses to resist drought and dig wells, which was originally intended to enable the masses to grow more grain, but because compulsory command methods were used, although the planned number was completed, the wells were dug very poorly and the water was too shallow to use. These vivid facts educated the party members and made them realize that compulsory commandism is not only a laborious and thankless approach, but also can ruin the work.

After the above criticism, party members initially recognized the harm of compulsory commandism. However, some still believed that compulsory commands were forced by higher authorities, or said: District cadres also use compulsory commands, why only criticize village cadres, and refused to conduct self-examination. Thus, for problems that should be the responsibility of county and district leading cadres, the work team made self-criticism on behalf of the county and district; for those that should be the responsibility of village cadres, they were instructed to conduct self-examination. After clarifying responsibilities, the party members were all sincerely convinced. Party member Gao Yushan said, "Whoever's fault it is, should be responsible, this is truly fair and reasonable." Zhang Yucai said, "The leading comrades have humbly made self-criticism, what else can we say!" Even the party members with more serious compulsory command styles did not complain about the leaders at this time, and could humbly conduct self-examination.

In order to further improve the ideological understanding of party members, the work team led everyone to analyze the root causes of compulsory commandism. Li Kun said, "I committed compulsory commandism mainly because I was arrogant and complacent, conceited, and looked down on the masses." Zhao Xizhen said, "When doing work, I didn't consult with the masses and acted arbitrarily. Some work was divorced from reality, which resulted in compulsory commandism." Zhang Yucai said, "As soon as the higher authorities gave us a task, I became anxious in my heart, only thinking about completing the task all at once. The masses couldn't accept it, and I thought they were backward. This is the root of my compulsory commandism." After self-examination, many party members formulated plans to correct their compulsory command styles.

After criticizing the compulsory command style, some party members still had doubts about the working methods of the mass line, and some did not know how to follow the mass line. Therefore, the work team adopted two methods: one method was to lead all party members to summarize the working methods of the mass line in the village. Last spring, when Sanshan Village mobilized the masses to establish patriotic covenants, party members Qiao Yanyi, Yang Wenshan, and others went door-to-door to mobilize and took the lead in subscribing first, as a result, the masses supported them, and the households quickly established patriotic covenants, and they were specific and practical. When mobilizing the masses to dig the Shanzhong River, they initially adopted compulsory command methods. Although the masses went, they were not very motivated, and two days of work were not finished in three days. Later, the cadres patiently and repeatedly explained the benefits of digging the river to the masses and took the lead in digging soil, so the masses' enthusiasm immediately increased, and they completed two days of work in one day. Through such vivid examples, the party members realized the benefits of following the mass line and proved that every cadre can follow the mass line, which increased everyone's work confidence. Another method was that the work team led the village cadres to use the working methods of the mass line to develop supply and marketing cooperative members. Sixiao Village was originally considered the most backward village by the village cadres. For the past two years, the village cadres had used compulsory command working methods to ask the masses to invest in the supply and marketing cooperative, but very few shares were invested, only over seventy shares. This time, the work team led the cadres to deeply and repeatedly publicize the benefits of joining the cooperative to the masses. With the lead of the activists, the shares increased to one hundred and twenty-five shares. The masses were very satisfied with this. Then they asked the village cadres to go to Yixiao Village to work using the same working methods, and the results were also very good, with a total of more than eighty shares developed. Through such practical learning, the party members learned the working methods of the mass line. Party members unanimously reflected that the working methods of the mass line are good, and the work is completed quickly and well. Even Village Chief Zhao Xizhen and Deputy Village Chief Ma Yushan, who had always advocated compulsory commands to the masses, happily said: In the past, we couldn't do without compulsory commands, but now we have also learned to follow the mass line!

After this rectification of the compulsory command style, the party members' awareness has been greatly improved, their work has become more active, and their style has been transformed. Party members reflected: We will never glare at the masses and act like officials again. Party member Chang Guoxing said even more excitedly: "This Party consolidation is effective, not only have we recognized and corrected our mistakes, but we have also learned working methods." The masses also said: This time the correction of certain party members' compulsory command style will make the work better.

    中共天竺村支部整党中纠正了强迫命令作风
    中共河北省通县地委会
    中共顺义县天竺村支部，是在一九四五年建立的，现有党员三十四名。这个支部几年来为党为人民作了许多工作，但是有部分党员，由于阶级觉悟不高，加上在工作上缺少办法，在进行工作时，不是耐心地反复地向群众进行宣传教育，而是采用强迫命令的方法。如今年春季抗旱打井时，即按地亩摊款，强迫一百多户合打一眼井；又如推销有奖储蓄时，虽喊着自愿认购，可是事先就规定了必须认购的数字。甚至有些党员干部还打人捆人，前民兵中队长李坤共打过十六次人。这样就严重地影响了党与群众的关系，影响了党与政府的农村方针政策的贯彻。
    此次整党学习中，即注意了进行走群众路线的教育。开始进行教育时，多数党员认为群众落后，不强迫着点不行，尤其是有强迫命令作风的党员更抱有抵抗情绪。例如民兵副中队长张玉才说：“不强迫命令，那就什么也别干了。”村长赵希珍说：“走群众路线在别的村吃的开，在咱们村就吃不开。”李坤说：“强迫命令是为了完成上级任务，不能算党员干部的过错。”还有的因打人捆人受到过处分，就在背后讲怪话。显然，这些错误的说法主要是党员对强迫命令作风的危害性认识不够，同时也由于在他们思想认识未提高以前，找不出一种好的工作作风来代替强迫命令作风，满认为这就是唯一的好的方法。因此，要解决这个问题，首先必须帮助大家深刻地认识到为什么强迫命令不对，什么样的作风才是好的工作作风。解决了这个问题，才能发动党员自觉地批判强迫命令作风。根据上述情况，工作组在讲党员标准的第七条时，就着重地说明了共产党员要有民主作风，有事要和群众商量，做工作要进行宣传教育，绝不允许采用强迫命令的方法。因为强迫命令会把本来是群众所乐意做的事情，变成群众不乐意做的事情，把好事做坏，使党遭受损失，脱离群众。打人骂人是侵犯人权、违法乱纪的行为，更不是共产党员的作风。在讲课中还结合着本村强迫命令的例子，从各方面说明强迫命令的害处。讲课后，工作组又引导大家总结了本村由于强迫命令而未做好的几件工作。例如给群众打防疫针，这本来是一件好事，但是由于进行了强迫命令，结果引起群众不满。又如动员群众抗旱打井，这原是为了使群众多打粮食，但因使用了强迫命令的方法，虽然也完成了计划数字，井却打的很不好，水浅不能使用。通过这些活的事实，教育了党员，使党员认识到强迫命令不仅是一种费力不讨好的作法，而且会把工作做坏。
    经过以上的批判，党员初步认识了强迫命令的危害性。但还有的认为强迫命令是上级逼出来的，或者说：区干部也有强迫命令，为什么单反村干部，就不肯进行检查。这样，应由县区领导干部负责的问题，工作组就代表县区作了检讨；应由村干部负责的，则责成村干部进行检查。分清责任后，党员都心悦诚服。党员高玉山说：“是谁的错误由谁负责，这才真是公平合理。”张玉才说：“领导同志都虚心作了检讨，咱们有什么说的！”就是强迫命令作风比较严重的党员，这时也不埋怨领导，能虚心地进行检讨。
    为了进一步提高党员的思想认识，工作组领导大家分析了产生强迫命令的根源。李坤说：“我犯强迫命令，主要是因为骄傲自满，自高自大，看不起群众。”赵希珍说：“做工作时不和群众商量，独断独行，有些工作脱离了实际，结果就产生了强迫命令。”张玉才说：“上级一给任务，心眼里就发急，光想一下子就完成任务，群众接受不了，还认为群众落后，这是我犯强迫命令的根子。”经过检查，很多党员都分别订出了纠正强迫命令作风的计划。
    在批判了强迫命令的作风以后，有的党员对群众路线的工作方法还存在着怀疑，有的不知道群众路线怎么走。因此，工作组又采取了两个方法：一个方法是领导全体党员总结了本村走群众路线的工作方法。三山村在去年春季发动群众订立爱国公约时，党员乔言义、杨文山等挨户进行动员，并带头先订，结果群众都拥护，各户很快地订立了爱国公约，并且订的具体实际。在动员群众挖山中河时，开始是采用了强迫命令的办法，虽然群众去了，但干活很不起劲，两天的活三天还没干完。后来干部向群众耐心地反复地讲明挖河的好处，并带头挖土，于是群众的情绪马上振奋起来，一天就干了两天活。通过这样活生生的事例使党员认识了走群众路线的好处，并证明了每个干部都可以走群众路线，增加了大家的工作信心。另一个方法是工作组领导村干部用群众路线的工作方法去发展供销社员。四小村原是村干部认为最落后的小村，两年来村干部使用强迫命令的工作方法要群众在供销社入股，但是入的股很少，才七十多股，这次工作组领导着干部向群众深入地反复地宣传入社的好处，在积极分子的带头下，股金就增至一百二十五股。群众对此非常满意。接着又叫村干部们到一小村用同样的工作方法去工作，结果也很好，共发展了八十多股。经过这样的实际学习，使党员学会了走群众路线的工作方法。党员一致反映：走群众路线的工作方法就是好，工作完成的又快又好。即是从来主张对群众采取强迫命令的村长赵希珍、副村长马玉山也高兴地说：过去咱们离开强迫命令不行，现在也学会走群众路线了！
    经过这次对强迫命令作风的整顿，党员的觉悟都大大地提高了，工作积极了，作风转变了。党员反映：今后再也不和群众横眉瞪眼当老爷了。党员常国兴更兴奋地说：“这次整党有效验，不光认识和改正了错误，还学会了工作方法。”群众也说：这次纠正了某些党员的强迫命令作风，就会把工作做得更好。
