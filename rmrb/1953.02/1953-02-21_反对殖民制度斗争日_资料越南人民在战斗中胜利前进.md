Data on "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism"
The Vietnamese People Advance Victoriously in Battle

    As the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," which awakens people to resist imperialist enslavement, approaches, people all over the world are watching the Vietnamese people's war of liberation with excitement and sympathy; watching the glorious victories achieved by the Vietnamese People's Army, which has grown stronger in the smoke and flames of battle, in its struggle against the French aggressors.

    The history of the Vietnamese people's six-year-plus war of liberation vividly records the rise and fall of the French aggressors from arrogance to desperation. When French imperialism perfidiously attacked the newly established Democratic Republic of Vietnam seven years ago, the French warlords were so arrogant and rampant that they openly clamored to reconquer Vietnam within three months. But several years have passed, and the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, which had temporarily retreated to the forests and mountains, have not only not been eliminated, but have instead grown rapidly. Not only have they grown stronger, but they have also inflicted heavy blows on the French colonialists, causing them to suffer repeated defeats. The Vietnamese People's Army has liberated most of Vietnam's territory. The French army now only occupies some isolated cities and part of the lines of communication.

    Starting at the end of 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army began to launch offensives against the arrogant French invading army in North Vietnam. The French army retreated step by step and was driven out of the five provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Lao Cai, Bac Kan, and Thai Nguyen. In the spring of 1952, the French invading army suffered another major defeat in Hoa Binh, losing 22,000 men. After the Hoa Binh campaign, part of the main force of the People's Army entered the fertile Red River Delta to strengthen the guerrilla warfare in this area. The People's Army and guerrillas closely coordinated their operations and were active everywhere. In the forty days before the end of November 1952, they eliminated 120 French strongholds.

    After the rainy season of 1952, the People's Army crossed the Red River and the Black River to launch an offensive in the northwest region, liberating most of the land in the Son La and Lai Chau areas and advancing to the border with Laos. This time, the People's Army smashed the French army's 270-kilometer defense line along the Black River, besieging the French army in Lai Chau City and Na San.

    After the Northwest Campaign, the situation in North Vietnam changed greatly. The North Vietnam liberated area was greatly consolidated and expanded, and it was connected to the Central Vietnam liberated area in the south. Now, there are no enemy troops in the area more than 400 kilometers wide from Lang Son in the east to near Lai Chau in the west.

    The People's Army fighting in the narrow Central Vietnam region is also growing stronger day by day, establishing consolidated liberated areas. The era of the French army swaggering and carrying out "mopping-up" operations is gone forever. The People's Army recently attacked the French army in the An Khe area of ​​central South Vietnam, forcing the French army to transfer many troops from South and North Vietnam to reinforce. In order to help the French army in An Khe lift the siege, the French army landed on the Qui Nhon coast and boasted that this landing was "the largest amphibious landing operation in seven years." However, under the fierce attacks of the People's Army, these French troops stayed on the shore for less than ten days before hurriedly climbing back onto warships and retreating in disgrace.

    In South Vietnam, guerrilla warfare has spread to the French army's lair in Saigon and the rubber plantation area, which the French colonialists regard as a treasure trove. The South Vietnam People's Army is rapidly growing stronger and has established solid liberated areas in Dong Thap Muoi, Ba Ria, Ca Mau and other places. This makes French imperialism very uneasy. In order to consolidate this rich "rear," the French army concentrated more than 7,000 troops in the spring of 1952 to attack the Dong Thap Muoi liberated area north of Saigon. These restless French troops were severely attacked by the People's Army and guerrillas, suffering nearly 2,000 casualties, and as a result, they fled the plain in disarray.

    On the entire Vietnamese battlefield, although France has more than 300,000 troops, it is completely in a passive and beaten position under the attacks of the People's Army. The French army's combat effectiveness is weakening day by day, and its morale is getting lower and lower. The desertion and mutiny of puppet troops are increasing day by day. Many European and African soldiers also demanded to go home and were unwilling to fight.

    In the six-year-plus "dirty war," the French army has replaced its generals seven times, suffered 250,000 casualties, and spent more than 2,500 billion francs (approximately 7.1 billion U.S. dollars). The huge consumption of the war has made the French rulers shout that they "can't afford it." In order to continue the war, the French aggressors, under the urging of American interventionists, are stepping up their plunder of manpower and material resources in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam in order to achieve the goal of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese." France has decided to step up conscription, expanding the Bao Dai puppet army from 120,000 to 160,000 to supplement the French army's losses on the battlefield; on the other hand, it is preparing to extort more military spending from the Bao Dai puppet group. When the French Parliament discussed the military budget for the invasion of Vietnam this January, it revealed that the Bao Dai puppet group had "contributed" 30 billion francs in military spending in 1952, and 14.75 billion francs before 1952.

    While stepping up the plunder of manpower and material resources in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, the French rulers also slavishly asked the United States for increased assistance. Everyone has noticed that one of the key points in the U.S. imperialists' recent clamor to expand the Asian war of aggression is to intensify their intervention in Vietnam. The United States has repeatedly stated that it will give the French army invading Vietnam "priority assistance second only to Korea" and has promised to bear half of France's military spending for the invasion of Vietnam in 1953. The purpose of the United States in doing so is to try to replace its French "ally" in Vietnam's influence in the process of intensifying its intervention in the Vietnamese people's war of liberation. For the Vietnamese people, the United States' "aid" to the French aggressors is nothing new. The United States has long been interfering in the Vietnamese war of liberation, attempting to strangle the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States has transported a large number of airplanes and cannons to the French invading army. But these munitions have not been able to save the French aggressors from their inevitable defeat. On the contrary, the French army has served as a transportation team, transferring these U.S. "aid" munitions to the Vietnamese People's Army.

    Despite the best efforts of the U.S. and French imperialists to struggle, this "dirty war" is already doomed to be lost. Even French reactionary leader Daladier had to admit this. Daladier once described the tragic end of the French aggressors, saying: "The war in Indochina requires huge sacrifices and huge expenses; in the end, we will still have to leave this country."

    The Vietnamese people, who have been tested by a long period of war, have embarked on the road to victory, and the fate awaiting the French colonialists and American interventionists is precisely—"leave this country"!

    “反对殖民制度斗争日”资料越南人民在战斗中胜利前进
    在唤起人们反抗帝国主义奴役的“反对殖民制度斗争日”来临的时候，全世界人民都怀着兴奋和同情的心情，注视着越南人民的解放战争；注视着在硝烟和炮火中成长壮大的越南人民军部队在反抗法国侵略者的斗争中所取得的光辉胜利。
    越南人民的六年多解放战争的历史，活生生地写下了法国侵略者从气焰万丈走向穷途末路的消长变化。在七年前法帝国主义背信进攻刚成立不久的越南民主共和国的时候，法国军阀们曾经是如此的狂妄和嚣张，他们公开叫喊着要在三个月内重新征服越南。但是几个年头过去了，暂时退到森林和崇山峻岭的越南人民武装部队不但没有被消灭，相反地，是在迅速壮大。不但壮大，而且给法国殖民者以沉重的打击，使他们一败涂地。越南人民军已经解放了越南的绝大部分的领土。法军现在只占有一些孤立的城市和一部分交通线。
    从一九五○年年底起，越南人民军就开始在北越向傲慢的法国侵略军队发动进攻。法军节节败退，被赶出高平、谅山、老街、北?、太原这五个省份。一九五二年春天，法国侵略军在和平城又吃了一个大败仗，损失二万二千人。和平战役以后，人民军有一部分主力进入富饶的红河三角洲，加强了这一地区的游击战争。人民军和游击队密切配合作战，到处活动。在一九五二年十一月底以前的四十天中，他们拔除了法军据点一百二十处。
    一九五二年雨季过后，人民军越过红河和黑水江向西北地区发动攻势，解放了山萝、莱州地区的大部分土地，挺进到寮国边境。这一次，人民军打垮了法军沿黑水江的二百七十公里的防线，把法军围困在莱州城和那岑。
    在西北战役以后，北越的形势有了很大的变化。北越解放区是大大地巩固和扩大了，并且和南面的中越解放区连成一片。现在，从东边的谅山起到西边的莱州附近止的四百多公里宽的土地上，已经没有敌军。
    在狭长的中越地区作战的人民军也一天天壮大起来，建立了巩固的解放区。法军大摇大摆地进行“扫荡”的时代已经一去不返。人民军最近进攻中越南部安溪地区的法军，迫使法军从南越和北越抽调许多部队赶往增援。为了帮助安溪的法军解围，法军在归仁海岸登陆，并把这次登陆吹嘘为“七年来最大的一次两栖登陆战”。但在人民军的猛烈进攻下，这些法军在岸上逗留不到十天，就仓促地爬回军舰，丢脸地撤退了。
    在南越，游击战争已扩展到西贡的法军巢穴和被法国殖民者当做聚宝盆的橡胶种植园地带。南越人民军力量迅速壮大，已在同塔梅、巴地、金瓯等地建立了牢固的解放区。这使法帝国主义非常不安。为了巩固这个富饶的“后方”，法军在一九五二年春天集中了七千多名部队向西贡以北的同塔梅解放区进攻。这些蠢动的法军遭到人民军和游击队的痛击，死伤近两千人，结果丢盔弃甲地逃出这个平原。
    在整个越南战场上，法国虽有三十多万部队，但在人民军的进攻下，完全处于被动和挨打的地位。法军战斗力是一天比一天削弱，士气也越来越低沉。伪军开小差、哗变一天比一天多。很多欧非籍的士兵也要求回家，不愿意打仗。
    在六年多的“肮脏战争”中，法军撤换了七次将领，死伤二十五万人，花费了二万五千多亿法郎
    （约合七十一亿美元）。战争的巨大消耗已使法国统治者叫喊“负担不起了”。为了继续进行战争，法国侵略者在美国干涉者的督促下，正加紧搜刮越南法占区的人力和物力，以达到“以战养战”、
    “用越南人打越南人”的目的。法国已决定加紧抓丁，将保大伪军从十二万人扩充到十六万人，补充法军在战场上的损失；另一方面，准备向保大傀儡集团勒索更多的军费。法国议会今年一月讨论侵越军事预算时就曾透露：保大傀儡集团在一九五二年“贡献”的军费是三百亿法郎，一九五二年以前是一百四十七亿五千万法郎。
    与加紧搜刮越南法占区的人力和物力的同时，法国统治者并奴颜婢膝地向美国要求增加援助。大家都已注意到，美帝国主义最近在扩大亚洲侵略战争的叫嚣中，重点之一就是加紧干涉越南。美国曾一再表示要给侵越法军以“仅次于朝鲜”的优先援助，并答应在一九五三年负担法国侵越军费的一半。美国这样做的目的，是企图在加紧干涉越南人民解放战争的过程中，取代它的法国“盟友”在越南的势力。对越南人民说来，美国对法国侵略者的
    “援助”早已不是新鲜的事情。很早以来，美国就已经干涉越南的解放战争，企图扼杀越南民主共和国。美国将大批飞机、大炮运交法国侵越军队。但是这些军火却没有能够挽救法国侵略者的一败涂地的命运。相反地，法军却充当了运输队，把这些美
    “援”军火转送到越南人民军手里。
    尽管美、法帝国主义竭力设法挣扎，这场“肮脏战争”是已经输定了。连法国反动派头子达拉第也不得不承认这一点。达拉第曾经描画法国侵略者的悲惨下场说：“印度支那的战争要求作巨大的牺牲，需要巨大的经费；到头来我们还是不得不离开这个国家。”
    经过长期战争考验的越南人民已经走上胜利的道路，等待着法国殖民者和美国干涉者的命运正是——“离开这个国家”！
