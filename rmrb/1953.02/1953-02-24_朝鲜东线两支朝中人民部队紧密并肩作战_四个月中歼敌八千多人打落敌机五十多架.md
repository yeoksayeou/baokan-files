Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 23rd: According to a Korean Central News Agency front-line reporter: The brave men of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are firmly defending the areas of Mundung-ri and Eo-eun Mountain on the eastern front, have fought shoulder to shoulder, giving the U.S. 25th Division, 40th Division, and the Syngman Rhee puppet army's 7th Division a heavy blow. In the past four months of combat, they annihilated over 8,000 enemies, destroyed over 40 enemy artillery pieces of various types, over 50 light and heavy machine guns, and 5 tanks, and shot down over 50 enemy planes.

　　The two Korean and Chinese People's units, fighting shoulder to shoulder in Mundung-ri, once annihilated an entire U.S. battalion. That day, a U.S. battalion launched an attack on a position defended by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The cunning enemy, one hour before launching the attack, pretended to attack the position of the adjacent People's Army, attempting to make the Volunteer soldiers lower their guard. However, the Korean and Chinese People's forces had already seen through the enemy's trick, and they made arrangements to cooperate and encircle the U.S. troops. When the U.S. troops invaded, the Volunteer soldiers temporarily retreated from the position in order to lure the enemy in deep. At the same time, the soldiers of the Kim Hak-bong company of the People's Army vigilantly moved behind enemy lines, cutting off the U.S. troops' retreat. At around 9:00 p.m., the U.S. troops' retreat had been completely cut off, and the Volunteer forces had also moved to the flanks of the U.S. troops, forming a strong encirclement. Two green flares rose into the air simultaneously, and the Korean and Chinese People's forces tightly tightened the encirclement, using machine guns and automatic rifles to concentrate fire on the encircled U.S. troops. An hour later, this group of U.S. troops was annihilated.

　　In mid-October of last year, the enemy, mainly consisting of the Rhee puppet army, invaded our army's position on Eo-eun Mountain. Under the cover of the fierce artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese People's armies, the Volunteer forces launched a counterattack, defeating the enemy's attack and taking advantage of the victory to pursue and occupy three highlands defended by the enemy. Afterwards, the enemy mobilized the reserve forces of the Rhee puppet army's 7th Division and the U.S. 25th Division to counterattack the highlands occupied by the Volunteers from the side of Eo-eun Mountain. At this time, the soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Army organized assault teams, fearlessly inserting themselves into the enemy's attacking forces and, together with the Volunteer soldiers, routed the invading enemy troops. At the same time, the artillery units of the Korean and Chinese People's armies also coordinated in combat, using dense and accurate artillery fire to destroy enemy positions, suppress enemy firepower, and cover our infantry's pursuit. In this joint operation, the Korean and Chinese People's armies annihilated more than 2,000 enemy troops and occupied several strategically advantageous highlands, forcing the enemy to retreat several kilometers. After the victory, the frontline loudspeaker of a certain unit of the Volunteers broadcasted cheers of "Salute to the comrades of the People's Army!" and "Long live the victory of the Korean and Chinese People's armies!"

　　On November 3rd, the two Korean and Chinese People's units conducted close coordinated operations to capture the enemy's key point, the 851 Highland. At 9:00 p.m. that night, countless cannons of different calibers from the artillery of the Korean and Chinese People's armies bombarded the 851 Highland, covering the assault by the brave men of the Choi Tae-hoon detachment of a certain unit of the People's Army. At the same time, a heavy machine gun company of a certain unit of the Volunteers, in order to better cover this assault team of the People's Army, also braved the enemy's retaliatory fire and entered the flanks of the enemy's forward position, completely sealing off over a dozen heavy machine gun firing points of the enemy. As a result, the 851 Highland was quickly captured by the People's Army. At around 10:00 p.m., part of the U.S. 40th Division frantically counterattacked the highland. A certain unit of the Volunteers immediately organized an attack to reinforce the fraternal army. The Korean and Chinese People's armies coordinated in combat, finally defeating the enemy and thwarting their attempt to recapture the highland.

    朝鲜东线两支朝中人民部队紧密并肩作战
    四个月中歼敌八千多人打落敌机五十多架
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社前线记者报道：坚守东线文登里、鱼隐山一带的朝鲜人民军某部和志愿军某部的勇士们紧密地并肩作战，给了美军第二十五师、第四十师和李承晚伪军第七师以沉重的打击。在过去四个月的战斗中，共歼敌八千多人，击毁敌各种炮四十多门，轻重机枪五十多挺，坦克五辆，并打落敌机五十多架。
    这两支朝中人民部队在文登里的并肩作战中，有一次曾围歼美军一个营。那天，美军一个营向志愿军某部防守的阵地发起了攻击。狡猾的敌人在发动攻击的一小时以前，装着要攻击邻接的人民军的阵地的样子，企图使志愿军战士们疏于防备。但是，朝中人民部队早已识破了敌人的诡计，他们作了互相配合围歼美军的部署。志愿军勇士们在美军进犯时，为了诱敌深入，暂时转移了阵地。同时，人民军金学凤连的战士们机警地转入敌后，切断美军退路。晚上九时许，美军退路已被完全切断，志愿军部队也已转移到美军侧面，坚强的包围圈已经形成。两颗绿色信号弹同时升到空中，朝中人民部队紧紧地收缩包围圈，用机枪和自动枪集中射击被包围的美军。一小时以后，这批美军就被歼灭了。
    去年十月中旬，敌军以李伪军为主力，向鱼隐山我军阵地进犯。志愿军部队就在朝中人民军队猛烈的炮火的掩护下展开反击，打垮了敌军的进攻，并乘胜追击，占领了敌军据守的三个高地。此后敌动员了李伪军第七师和美军第二十五师的后备部队，从鱼隐山侧面向志愿军占领的高地反扑。这时，人民军某部的战士们就组织突击队，奋不顾身地插入敌人的攻击队中，和志愿军勇士们一起击溃了进犯的敌军。同时朝中人民军队的炮兵们也配合作战，用密集而准确的炮火破坏敌阵，压制敌军火力，掩护我军步兵追击。朝中人民军队在这次并肩作战中，共歼灭了二千多名敌军，占领了战略上有利的几个高地，敌军被迫后退了数公里。战斗胜利结束后，志愿军某部的火线广播筒里传出了“向人民军同志们致敬！”“朝中人民军队胜利万岁！”的欢呼。
    十一月三日，这两支朝中人民部队为攻占敌军要冲八五一高地，又进行了密切的协同作战。这天夜间九时，朝中人民军队炮兵无数门不同口径的大炮齐向八五一高地轰击，掩护人民军某部崔泰勋区分队的勇士们进行突击。同时志愿军某部的一个重机枪连为了更好地掩护人民军的这支突击队，也冒着敌军还射的炮火，进入敌前沿阵地的侧面，完全封锁了敌军的十几个重机枪火力点。八五一高地因而很快地就被人民军部队攻占了。夜十时许，美军第四十师的一部分兵力向该高地疯狂反扑。志愿军某部立即组织出击，增援友军。朝中人民军队配合作战，终于击败了敌军，粉碎了敌人夺回高地的企图。
