To implement Chairman Mao's great call

The Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference heard the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the report on conference affairs by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the report on the proceedings and achievements of the World People's Peace Congress by Deputy Head Guo Moruo. After enthusiastic discussions in groups and at the plenary session, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Political Report," calling on all nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, patriotic democratic personages, and overseas Chinese throughout the country to unite more closely under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, to mobilize together, and to strive for the victorious completion of the three major tasks. The meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Supporting the Demands of the World People's Peace Congress," calling on the people of the whole country to unite and join hands with international friends to strive for the realization of the World People's Peace Congress's just demands for the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact of Peace and other items. The meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Report on the Work of the Standing Committee," entrusting the Standing Committee with the responsibility of preparing for the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and decided to expand the number of Standing Committee members, adding twenty-three new members. Chairman Mao Zedong spoke at the closing of the meeting, calling on the people of the whole country to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to learn from the Soviet Union, and to oppose bureaucracy. Chairman Mao's call and the various reports and resolutions of the meeting will have a tremendous impact on further mobilizing and organizing the people of the whole country to courageously complete this year's three major tasks.

The convening of this meeting comes precisely at a time when the economic recovery phase of our country has ended and our country's first Five-Year Plan is beginning. The "Resolution on the Political Report" calls on the people of the whole country to concentrate their efforts, increase production, practice strict economy, complete and overfulfill the 1953 economic construction plan, national defense construction plan, and social and cultural construction plan, and create a good start for the country's first Five-Year Plan. Our large-scale economic construction is starting in the environment of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This great struggle defends the construction of the motherland and encourages all the people of the motherland to participate in the construction of the motherland selflessly. We must use the rapidly advancing strength of the motherland's construction to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and ensure the complete victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and further consolidate and strengthen our country's national defense capabilities. The people of our country are filled with enthusiasm for peaceful construction and the desire to maintain lasting peace. We have always hoped to end the Korean War through peaceful means, but U.S. imperialism still refuses peace and plots to expand the war, which makes it impossible for us not to be highly vigilant and expose the war conspiracies of the U.S. aggressors, and impossible not to continue to fight to the end against the aggressors who are hindering our people from carrying out peaceful construction.

Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the closing of this meeting: "Because U.S. imperialism insists on detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, sabotages the armistice negotiations, and attempts to expand the war of aggression against Korea, the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea must continue to be strengthened. We want peace, but as long as U.S. imperialism does not abandon its unreasonable demands and its conspiracy to expand aggression, the Chinese people are determined to fight together with the Korean people to the end. This is not because we are belligerent. We are willing to stop fighting immediately, and the remaining issues can be resolved in the future. But U.S. imperialism is unwilling to do so, then so be it, let us fight. U.S. imperialism is willing to fight for how many years, we are prepared to fight with it for how many years, until U.S. imperialism is willing to give up, until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory." This solemn statement represents the common will of all the people of our country. We not only have the confidence to smash any attacks and assaults by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and the confidence to achieve the final victory of the Chinese and Korean people through a long-term struggle, but also the confidence to complete our economic construction plan in this struggle, just as we completed our economic recovery plan in the past three years.

The convening of this meeting is taking place on the eve of the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. In Vice Chairman Zhou's political report and in the speeches of the various committee members, it was unanimously pointed out that our country's economic recovery could be so rapid, and our country's large-scale economic construction could begin so quickly, is inseparable from the sincere and selfless brotherly assistance of the great Soviet Union. And the huge economic construction tasks facing us require us to learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is inside or outside the Communist Party, old cadres or new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, as well as workers and peasants, we must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union to build our country."

Everyone already knows that our current learning from the Soviet Union's experience is of decisive significance for the development of our country's construction cause. Although we have already produced many moving records in learning from the Soviet Union, it is a pity that there are still some people who have not seriously put in hard work to learn, but instead hold a fluke mentality, look around, waste time, and fantasize that there is some magic that can help them suddenly understand after waking up. Mencius told the story of two people learning to play chess: One person "concentrated his mind and will" and listened to the teacher's instructions, and learned to play chess; the other person, while listening to the teacher's instructions, "was thinking of a swan coming, wanting to take his bow and arrow to shoot it," and daydreamed like this, and as a result could not learn. It is impossible to learn from the Soviet Union without concentrating one's mind and will and without putting in hard work. There are also some people who are skeptical about learning from the Soviet Union, lacking the revolutionary spirit of selfless dedication to building a great motherland and a pragmatic attitude. There are also some people who often use the difficulties encountered in learning from the Soviet Union as an excuse not to learn. They only want to sit in the office and flip through books, move their pens, copy old rules, and handle matters based on estimates, but are unwilling to learn and comprehend the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in arduous practice. They often exaggerate the difficulties of learning from the Soviet Union with subjectively imagined difficulties. They do not understand that there are difficulties, but they are not insurmountable. Marx taught us long ago: "There is no safe road in science, only those who climb without fear of hardship and danger have the hope of reaching the brilliant peak." All these people have one thing in common, that is, they lack a simple, hardworking, striving, and persistent spirit. We must overcome this negative and skeptical attitude, and adopt a serious scientific attitude, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and a scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, to learn from the Soviet Union. Learning from the Soviet Union, as Chairman Mao Zedong instructed, should not only learn Marxist-Leninist theory, but also learn the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction, and also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. There can be no doubt about this. Soviet science and technology have absorbed all the scientific achievements of capitalist countries, and at the same time have been developed on the basis of thirty years of socialist construction. Therefore, in order to carry out large-scale economic construction, and in order to master advanced science and technology, we must learn from the Soviet Union. We must launch a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union in all parts of the country and in various construction undertakings. This is one of the important conditions to ensure that our country's large-scale construction work can proceed smoothly.

The convening of this meeting is taking place at a time when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions calling on all localities to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. The meeting also heard a special speech by Comrade An Ziwen, Minister of the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government and Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on this issue. Currently, the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has been launched nationwide and in government agencies at all levels; but we must further launch a resolute struggle. In last year's Three-Anti Campaign, although we basically solved the problems of corruption and waste among many staff members at the central, greater administrative region, provincial and municipal, and special district levels, the bureaucratic attitude of not understanding the suffering of the people, not understanding the situation a little further away from their work units, not understanding the many commandism and violations of law and discipline by bad people and bad deeds among cadres at the county, district, and township levels, or although they had some understanding of these bad people and bad deeds, but turned a blind eye, did not arouse indignation, did not feel the seriousness of the problem, and therefore did not take active measures to support good people, punish bad people, promote good deeds, and eliminate bad deeds, has basically not been resolved in many areas, many aspects, and many departments. This serious bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline greatly damage the construction enthusiasm of the people and greatly hinder the development of national construction. We should make all leaders understand that to overcome those commandism and violations of law and discipline by bad people and bad deeds below, we must at the same time oppose the bureaucracy of the leading organs. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "If we are to carry out large-scale national construction, we must overcome bureaucracy and closely link up with the masses of the people. Leading cadres at all levels, both central and local, should regularly go deep into the grassroots to inspect work. If the leading organs and leading cadres overcome bureaucracy, those bad phenomena of commandism and violations of law and discipline below will also be overcome. If these problems are all removed, our national planned construction will surely succeed, the people's democratic system will surely develop, the conspiracy of imperialism will surely fail, and we will surely be able to achieve complete victory!"

This meeting unanimously resolved to actively prepare for the election of people's congresses at all local levels and the National People's Congress, to realize the further democratization of the country, in order to more powerfully attract the people of the whole country to further manage state affairs and local affairs with the consciousness of masters, thereby a hundredfold strengthening our state organs, further unleashing the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the people, and more smoothly pushing forward our country's economic construction. The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline is also laying the foundation for the upcoming general election work. Because in places where bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline are serious, the people will hardly enjoy democratic rights, and the people cannot fully select the best and necessary candidates they think of into their state power organs and local power organs at all levels according to their own will, so that those people in these power organs who are not satisfied by the people will no longer be elected. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to immediately launch this struggle. This requires starting with handling letters from the people, inspecting work, educating cadres, and further developing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, combining it with the party rectification work currently underway in various localities and the upcoming general election work, as well as other tasks, thoroughly exposing the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and launching a sharp struggle against these phenomena. Only in this way will our various tasks be greatly improved, the revolutionary initiative and labor initiative of the people will be greatly increased, the democratic foundation of the general election will be greatly strengthened, the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea will be greatly strengthened, and the strength of large-scale national construction will be greatly strengthened.

We celebrate the success of this meeting, and we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao Zedong's great call into all aspects of our work. In this way, we will surely achieve great victories in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and in the construction undertakings in all aspects of the country.

### 贯彻毛主席的伟大号召

    贯彻毛主席的伟大号召
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议听取了周恩来副主席的政治报告、陈叔通副主席关于会务的报告和郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告，经过小组和大会的热烈讨论以后，一致通过了“关于政治报告的决议”，号召全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、各界爱国民主人士和国外华侨，在毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，结成更巩固的人民民主统一战线，一致动员起来，为胜利地完成三大任务而奋斗。会议一致通过“关于支持世界人民和平大会各项要求的决议”，号召全国人民团结一致，并联合国际友人，为实现世界人民和平大会关于缔结五大国和平公约和其他各项正义要求而奋斗。会议一致通过“关于常务委员会会务报告的决议”，委托常务委员会负责准备召开中国人民政协第二届全体会议，并决定扩大常务委员名额，增选了二十三位常务委员。毛泽东主席在会议闭幕时讲话，号召全国人民加强抗美援朝的斗争、学习苏联、反对官僚主义。毛主席的号召及会议的各项报告和决议，对于进一步动员和组织全国人民奋勇地完成今年的三大任务，将发生巨大的作用。
    这次会议的召开，正是我们国家经济恢复阶段已经结束、我国第一个五年建设计划开始的时候。“关于政治报告的决议”号召全国人民集中力量，增加生产，厉行节约，完成和超额完成一九五三年的经济建设计划、国防建设计划和社会文化建设计划，为国家建设的第一个五年计划造成良好的开端。我国的大规模经济建设是在抗美援朝斗争的环境下开始的。这个伟大的斗争保卫着祖国的建设，鼓舞着祖国全体人民奋不顾身地参加祖国建设。我们要用突飞猛进的祖国建设力量来支援抗美援朝斗争，保证抗美援朝的完全胜利。我们必须继续加强抗美援朝斗争，进一步巩固和壮大我国的国防力量。我国人民充满了和平建设的热情和维护持久和平的愿望。我们一直希望用和平的方法来结束朝鲜战争，但是美帝国主义仍然拒绝和平，并且阴谋扩大战争，这就使得我们不能不高度警惕和揭露美国侵略者的战争阴谋，不能不继续与阻碍我国人民进行和平建设的侵略者斗争到底。
    毛泽东主席在这次会议闭幕时的讲话中指出： “由于美帝国主义坚持扣留中朝战俘，破坏停战谈判，并且妄图扩大侵朝战争，所以，抗美援朝的斗争必须继续加强。我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战，剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好罢，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，
    一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”这个庄严的声明，代表了我国全体人民的共同意志。我们不但有信心粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的任何进攻和袭击，有信心经过长期斗争来取得中朝人民的最后胜利，而且有信心在这个斗争中完成我国的经济建设计划，如同在过去三年中完成我国的经济恢复计划一样。
    这次会议的召开，正在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年的前夕。在周副主席的政治报告中和各委员的发言中，都一致指出，我国经济能够这样迅速恢复，我国大规模经济建设能够这样迅速开始，是和伟大的苏联的真诚无私的兄弟般的援助分不开的。而摆在我们面前的巨大的经济建设任务，更需要我们从各方面向苏联学习。正如毛泽东主席所说的：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”
    人人都已经知道，我们现在学习苏联的经验，对我国建设事业的发展是有决定意义的。我们在学习苏联这方面虽然已经产生许多动人的纪录，但是很可惜，究竟还有一些人还没有认真地下苦功学习，而是抱着一种侥幸的心理，东张西望，浪费时光，幻想着有什么魔术可以帮助他们一觉醒来就豁然贯通似的。孟子说过两个人学下棋的故事：一个人
    “专心致志”，听老师的指点，就学会了下棋；另一个人，一边听老师指点，一边又“一心以为有鸿鹄将至，思援弓缴而射之”，这样胡思乱想，结果就不能学会。不专心致志，不下苦功夫，要想学习苏联是不可能的。还有一些人对于学习苏联抱怀疑的态度，缺乏为建设伟大祖国而奋不顾身的革命精神和实事求是态度。也有一些人常常以学习苏联所遇到的某些困难为借口而不愿学习。他们只愿意坐在办公室里翻翻书，动动笔，抄袭陈规，凭估计来办事，却不愿意在艰苦的实践中来学习和体会苏联的先进经验。他们常常以主观想像的困难来夸大学习苏联的困难。他们不了解困难是有的，但并不是不可克服的。马克思早就教导过我们：“在科学上是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在攀登上不畏劳苦不畏险阻的人，才有希望攀到光辉的顶点。”所有这些人，有一个共同的特点，就是缺乏朴素的、辛苦工作的、努力向前的、坚持到底的精神。我们必须克服这种消极的怀疑的态度，而采取严肃的科学态度，以高度的革命热情和科学的求实精神，来学习苏联。学习苏联，应像毛泽东主席所指示的那样，不仅要学习马克思列宁主义理论，也不仅要学习苏联社会主义建设的先进经验，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。在这一方面是不能有丝毫怀疑的。苏联的科学技术已把资本主义国家的一切科学成果都吸收在内，同时又在三十年来的社会主义建设的基础上加以发展。因此，我们为了进行大规模的经济建设，为了掌握先进的科学技术，就必须向苏联学习。我们要在全国各地，在各种建设事业中，掀起一个学习苏联的高潮。这是保证我国大规模建设工作能够顺利进行的重要条件之一。
    这次会议的召开，正在中共中央发出指示，号召各地开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争的时候。会议并听取了中央人民政府人事部部长、中共中央组织部副部长安子文同志关于这一问题的专门发言。目前反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，在全国范围内和各级机关中已经开展起来了；但是我们还必须进一步展开坚决的斗争。在去年的三反运动中，我们虽然基本上解决了中央、大行政区、省市和专区四级许多工作人员中的贪污问题和浪费问题，但对于不了解人民群众的痛苦，不了解离开自己工作机关稍为远
    一点的下情，不了解县区乡三级干部中存在着的许多命令主义和违法乱纪的坏人坏事，或者虽然对于这些坏人坏事有一些了解，但是熟视无睹，不引起义愤，不感觉问题的严重，因而不采取积极办法去支持好人，惩治坏人，发扬好事，消灭坏事，这样
    一方面的官僚主义则在许多地区，许多方面和许多部门，还是基本上没有解决。这种严重的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的行为，大大损害着人民群众的建设热情，大大阻碍着国家建设的开展。我们应使所有的领导人员懂得，要克服下面那些命令
    主义和违法乱纪的坏人坏事，就必须同时反对领导机关的官僚主义。正如毛泽东主席所指出：“我们要进行大规模的国家建设，就必须克服官僚主义，密切联系人民群众。中央和地方各级领导干部都应该经常地深入下层，检查工作。如果领导机关和领导干部克服了官僚主义，下面那些命令主义和违法乱纪的坏现象，也一定会得到克服的。这些毛病都去掉了，我们的国家计划建设就一定会成功，人民民主制度就一定会发展，帝国主义的阴谋就一定会失败，我们就一定能够取得完全的胜利！”
    这次会议一致决议积极准备地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会的选举，实现国家的进一步民主化，为的是更有力地吸引全国人民进一步以主人翁的自觉来管理国家事务和地方事务，从而百倍地加强我们的国家机关，更加发挥人民的革命热情和劳动热情，更加顺利地把我国经济建设推向前进。反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，同时也就是为即将开始的普选工作打下基础。因为凡是在官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象严重的地方，人民群众就很难享受到民主权利，人民群众就不能充分地按照自己的意志，把自己认为最好的和必要的人选到自己的国家政权机关和各级地方政权机关中去，使这些政权机关中为人民所不满意的人不再当选。因此，立即开展这个斗争是完全必需的。这就要首先从处理人民群众来信、检查工作、教育干部并在报纸上进一步展开批评与自我批评入手，与各地正在进行的整党工作和即将进行的普选工作以及其他各项工作结合起来，彻底揭发官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，向这些现象展开尖锐的斗争。这样才会大大改进我们的各项工作，大大提高人民群众的革命积极性和劳动积极性，大大地加强普选的民主基础，大大地加强抗美援朝的力量，大大地加强国家大规模建设的力量。
    我们庆祝这次会议的成功，我们要坚决地将毛泽东主席的伟大号召贯彻到各方面的工作中去。这样，我们就一定能在抗美援朝的斗争中和国家各方面的建设事业中都取得伟大的胜利。
