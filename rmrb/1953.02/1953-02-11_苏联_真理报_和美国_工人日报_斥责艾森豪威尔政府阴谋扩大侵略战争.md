Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published a commentary by Korionov on the 9th, discussing President Eisenhower's message to Congress, Secretary of State Dulles's speech, and his trip to Western Europe.

Korionov wrote: The program put forward by Eisenhower and Dulles is to expand the war rather than to stop the war and establish peace. As bourgeois newspapers have pointed out: The most shocking thing is Eisenhower's words about Taiwan, which strengthens the threat of expanding the war.

As everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been lingering in Taiwan under the protection of the US Seventh Fleet. Truman and Acheson, in order to cover up this act of aggression, once hypocritically said that this was to so-called "neutralize" Taiwan. According to Eisenhower's message, the United States will not only continue its de facto occupation of Taiwan in the future, but will also use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out armed aggression against the People's Republic of China.

The purpose of the US ruling group's intention to use the Kuomintang bandit gang to carry out aggressive activities against China is to prevent the end of the bloodshed in Korea and to expand the scope of the war in the Far East.

This policy is bound to arouse strong protests from all people who strive to defend peace. Taking Britain as an example, a mass movement against the policy of expanding the war in Asia is underway. The US President's decision has also been strongly criticized by many British parliamentarians - both Labor and Conservative members. Even the British ruling group felt it best to declare that they were not involved in the US government's actions.

Korionov continued: Foreign commentators pointed out that President Eisenhower's decision on Taiwan and Dulles's and Stassen's visit to Western Europe are directly related. In the Far East, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and Japanese militarists are actively preparing for new aggression against China; at the same time, in Europe, American diplomats are trying their best to promote the rapid restoration of the revanchist West German army in order to launch new war adventures against peace-loving European countries.

Dulles has clearly stated that only if the Western European countries ratify the Bonn and Paris "agreements" within the deadline set by Washington, will the US Congress be able to allocate dollars for "aid" to Western European countries in the future.

This request is simply an ultimatum, and it has aroused unparalleled anger everywhere. Newspapers of all factions in Britain have fiercely criticized it. The French newspaper "Liberation" clearly expressed the anger of the Western European people, saying: "Now is the time to oppose the crazy policies of the United States in Asia and Europe. We will lose nothing except the shackles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by doing so; we will gain national independence and peace."

Korionov concluded: The reaction of European and Asian countries to the US President's decision on Taiwan and Dulles's ultimatum to Western European countries fully exposes the further intensification of contradictions within the Anglo-American bloc. This is the inevitable consequence of the US top leaders' pursuit of an expansionist policy that violates the vital interests of all mankind.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th: The New York "Daily Worker" continued to comment on Eisenhower's State of the Union message to Congress under the title "Diplomacy by Cannon." The "Daily Worker" said: The real significance of Eisenhower's statement on Taiwan is that he is preparing to launch an undeclared war against the People's Republic of China, "the result of which can only be more casualties for us, a deeper involvement in the Asian war, and a greater danger of World War III."

The editorial continued: "It is not surprising that Senator Neely, a Democrat from West Virginia, said that the President's actions were 'like a gambler going all in at the Monte Carlo casino,' and that fear and protest were expressed in London, Paris, Bombay, and elsewhere."

The editorial pointed out: Almost eight years before Eisenhower delivered this message, at the Yalta Conference, the three countries of the Soviet Union, the the United States, and Britain united to carry out joint actions against aggression. The editorial then said: "But Wall Street and the Republican Party have been opposing the Big Three agreement. Harry Truman himself abandoned the Yalta Agreement and launched the Cold War against socialist countries. This five-star general is even more openly tearing up these treaties."

The editorial said: Eisenhower's action is "to notify socialist countries that the United States no longer recognizes the borders it solemnly agreed to, and that the United States will use its money, weapons, and special agents to continuously carry out 'liberation' activities in these countries through sabotage, assassination, terror, and war."

The editorial concluded by pointing out: The Yalta Agreement clearly provided an opportunity to consolidate world peace. The workers and people who supported the Yalta Agreement eight years ago, with the support of strong peace forces abroad, are still able to stop Eisenhower's plan to expand the war in Asia. The "Daily Worker" called on the American people to "speak out loudly, demanding a ceasefire in Korea and demanding negotiations on the only unresolved issue in the armistice agreement - the issue of prisoners of war."

### 苏联“真理报”和美国“工人日报”  斥责艾森豪威尔政府阴谋扩大侵略战争

    苏联“真理报”和美国“工人日报”
    斥责艾森豪威尔政府阴谋扩大侵略战争
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”九日刊载了科里奥诺夫的国际评论，论述美国新总统艾森豪威尔致国会的咨文、新国务卿杜勒斯的演说以及他的西欧之行。
    科里奥诺夫写道：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯所提出的纲领是要扩大战争而不是制止战争与建立和平。如资产阶级报纸所指出的：最令人吃惊的是艾森豪威尔关于台湾的话，这种话加强了扩大战争的威胁。
    大家知道：蒋介石匪帮曾在美国第七舰队的庇护下，苟延残喘于台湾。杜鲁门和艾奇逊为了掩饰这个侵略行动，曾经虚伪地说这是所谓把台湾“中立化”。根据艾森豪威尔的咨文来看，美国在将来不仅要继续实际占领台湾的行动，并且将利用蒋介石匪帮对中华人民共和国进行武装侵袭。
    美国统治集团打算使用国民党匪帮对中国进行侵略活动的目的是要阻止结束朝鲜的流血，并且要扩大远东战争的范围。
    这种政策必然要引起努力保卫和平的一切人民的强烈抗议。以英国为例，那里正在展开一个反对扩大亚洲战争政策的群众运动。美国总统的决定同时还遭到许多英国议员们——无论是工党议员或保守党议员——的强烈批评。甚至英国的统治集团也感觉到最好声明他们并没有参预美国政府的行动。
    科里奥诺夫继续写道：外国评论家们指出，艾森豪威尔总统关于台湾的决定和杜勒斯与史塔生之访问西欧有着直接的关系。在远东方面，蒋介石匪帮和日本军国主义者正在积极准备对中国进行新的侵略行动；同时，在欧洲方面，美国外交家们正在竭力促使复仇主义的西德军队迅速恢复，以便对爱好和平的欧洲国家发动新的战争冒险。
    杜勒斯已清楚地说明，只有西欧各国在华盛顿规定的限期内批准波恩和巴黎“协定”，美国国会将来才能为“援助”西欧国家拨付美元。
    这个要求简直就等于最后通牒，它在各地都激起无比的愤怒。英国各派系的报纸都给以猛烈抨击。法国报纸“解放报”清楚地表示出西欧人民的愤怒情绪，该报说：“现在已经到了反对美国在亚洲和欧洲的疯狂政策的时候了。我们这样做除了丢掉了北大西洋公约组织的枷锁之外是毫无损失的；我们将获得民族独立与和平。”
    科里奥诺夫最后写道：欧洲和亚洲国家对美国总统关于台湾的决定以及对杜勒斯向西欧各国提出的最后通牒的反应，充分地暴露出英美集团内部矛盾的进一步尖锐化。这是美国最高领导者违背了全体人类切身利益而追求的扩大侵略政策所必然产生的后果。
    【新华社布拉格十日电】纽约“工人日报”以“用大炮推行的外交政策”为题，继续评论艾森豪威尔致国会的国情咨文。“工人日报”说：艾森豪威尔关于台湾的声明的真正意义是他正在准备对中华人民共和国发动一场不宣而战的战争，“其结果只能使我们有更多的伤亡，更深地陷入亚洲战争，并使第三次世界大战的危险更大。”
    社论继续说：“西弗吉尼亚州民主党参议员尼莱说总统的行径‘活像在蒙特卡洛赌场中孤注一掷的赌徒’，此外，伦敦、巴黎、孟买各地都表示恐惧和抗议，这些都是不足为怪的。”
    社论指出：在艾森豪威尔发表这一咨文以前差不多八年，在雅尔塔会议上，苏、美、英三个国家团结起来，以进行反对侵略的联合行动。社论接着说：“但是华尔街与共和党一直在反对三大国协定。哈里·杜鲁门本人摈弃了雅尔塔协定，对社会主义国家发动了冷战。这位五星将军更公开地撕毁这些条约。”
    社论说：艾森豪威尔的行动是“通知社会主义国家：美国不再承认它所庄严地同意的疆界，美国将利用其金钱、武器与特务人员，用破坏、暗杀、恐怖与战争的方法不断进行‘解放’这些国家的活动。”
    社论在结论中指出：雅尔塔协定明显地提供了巩固世界和平的机会，八年前拥护雅尔塔协定的工人与人民，在国外强大的和平力量支持下，仍然能够制止艾森豪威尔扩大亚洲战争的计划。“工人日报”号召美国人民“大声疾呼，要求在朝鲜停火，并要求谈判停战协定中尚未解决的唯一问题——战俘问题。”
