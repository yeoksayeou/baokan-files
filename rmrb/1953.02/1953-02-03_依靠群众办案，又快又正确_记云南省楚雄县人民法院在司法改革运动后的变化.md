    Relying on the Masses to Handle Cases: Quickly and Correctly
    —Changes in the People's Court of Chuxiong County, Yunnan Province, after the Judicial Reform Movement
    Yunnan Provincial Judicial Reform Committee Office
    The People's Court of Chuxiong County, Yunnan Province, has undergone a fundamental transformation after the great judicial reform movement. In the past, especially in the early days after liberation, the impurity of the court's organization was extremely serious. This weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship was almost entirely controlled by a group of bad elements. A former Kuomintang official who had served as a puppet county head three times and a notorious local tyrant with blood debts had successively infiltrated and held leadership positions. Although this serious situation had changed somewhat after successive social reform movements, the organization was still very impure. On the eve of the judicial reform movement, among the nine cadres in the entire court, there were still two counter-revolutionaries, one former Kuomintang official, and three former judicial personnel. Due to the impurity of the organization, ideological impurity was also very serious. In addition to harboring counter-revolutionaries and engaging in corruption and bribery, these people also displayed old legal views and old judicial styles in handling cases. Some former judicial personnel openly requested in writing to higher authorities that they "still apply the Six Codes" on the grounds that "new laws have not yet been promulgated." Although this absurd request was not approved, in practice they still handled cases according to the old Kuomintang court's ways, reversing right and wrong, distorting policies, only sitting in court to interrogate, and glaring at the masses. Individual peasant cadres who had newly joined the work also became infected with this bad habit in this environment. This made the People's Court completely lose its due role, so that the masses reflected: the People's Court is almost the same as the Kuomintang era court.

    Chuxiong County was the first county in the Southwest region to launch the judicial reform movement. After three months of organizational rectification and ideological remolding, it has now undergone essential changes in organization, ideology, and systems. During the movement, the county successively dealt with four bad elements who harbored counter-revolutionaries, engaged in corruption and bribery, and had serious old legal views and old judicial styles; at the same time, it transferred in six strong cadres who had been tempered in suppressing bandits, land reform, and clearing up backlog cases. Now there are eleven cadres in the court, including one Party member and four Youth League members, and the organization has been basically purified and strengthened.

    During the movement, the court launched a sharp struggle and criticism against old legal views and old judicial styles, improved cadres' understanding of the nature of the People's Court's work, and clarified the principled boundaries between new and old laws. Judge Fan Shuchun was a cadre from a young student background who came to work at the People's Court in May 1951. Before the judicial reform movement, he did not know the importance of the court's work, especially working with former judicial personnel and former Kuomintang officials, and felt even more depressed. Therefore, he said to everyone he met: "Working in the court is such unlucky thing, I am looked down upon wherever I go." During the judicial reform movement, after being educated and seeing a large number of serious problems exposed, he began to feel that the court's work was not as unimportant as he had previously imagined. Later, seeing that the bad cadres were all transferred out and the good cadres were transferred in, he felt that the work had a future. Therefore, he not only actively examined himself and helped others in the movement, but also completely changed his past passive attitude after the movement. Judge Li Guoshun was a cadre from a hired laborer background. Before the judicial reform movement, he became a prisoner of the old law due to the influence of the old judicial personnel around him. In February 1951, a woman committed suicide by jumping into a dam because she was cruelly abused by her husband, Zhou Zhengan. However, Li Guoshun at that time, under the control of old legal thinking, adopted a "no prosecution, no investigation" attitude. After the judicial reform movement, he heard reports from the masses that three women had committed suicide by jumping into dams due to unbearable abuse in the past two years. At this time, he thought that he could no longer ignore it. Therefore, he patiently educated the masses through some female Youth League members, so that everyone understood the principle that if criminals are not punished by law, the safety of women's lives cannot be guaranteed. In this way, everyone actively reported the whole case of Zhou Zhengan's abuse of women and forcing his wife to commit suicide, and arrested Zhou Zhengan for legal action. Afterwards, a symposium was held to educate the masses. Hu Chaozhang, who often abused his wife, said: "I can't abuse her anymore in the future."

    Before the judicial reform movement, court cadres never thought of relying on the masses to handle cases. For the three years after liberation, the People's Court of Chuxiong County completely sat in court to interrogate and conduct closed-door trials. Not only did it not actively rely on the masses, but sometimes when the masses went to the court to testify and help solve cases, they were scolded as "accomplices." Therefore, many cases were not resolved or were handled incorrectly. After the judicial reform movement, the court first sorted out the 60 cases accumulated in the past, divided them into districts and categories, and went to the countryside for circuit trials and collective mediation. Judge Bai Fengchun used to sit in court to interrogate, and on average, he could not conclude one case a day; but this time he went to Heqian Township in the Second District, held two evening meetings, and solved 16 marriage cases. When he went down, he happened to encounter the peasants rushing to hand in patriotic public grain, and he could not find anyone all day long, but he did not bow to the difficulties. He helped the peasants hand in public grain during the day, and took the opportunity to understand some situations and find out the bottom line of the parties involved. In the evening, he convened mediation committee members, activists, and parties to a meeting, first explained the policies, and then the parties negotiated. In the past, parties always liked to make a lot of noise in court, but now both sides have reviewed and reconciled themselves; if they cannot reconcile, the mediation committee members will help persuade them. Those who should divorce will divorce, and those who should not divorce will agree not to divorce. As a result, only one of the sixteen marriage cases was judged, and the parties were all convinced. In the past, the court did not explain the policies and made judgments reluctantly, which were often difficult to enforce, especially the property issue after women's divorce, which was even more difficult to enforce. But now, after mediation and judgment, divorced women can immediately take things, and some men even automatically send the property that the women should get to the township. The case of Xu Lanying and Peng Faguai's divorce had been judged by the court before, but the property issue had never been resolved. This time, Peng Faguai still said at first: "If I give her this property, I won't have any to marry another wife in the future." But the masses said: "Now there is Chairman Mao's leadership, everyone has a share, she will take her share when she leaves, and others will bring a share when they come." This made Peng Faguai have no reason to say no. The next day, Xu Lanying invited a few people to Peng Faguai's house to move things happily, and said happily: "My case went to the district nine times and to the court twice before, but it could not be resolved. Today, the comrades of the court came to our village to help me solve it." Township head Zhou Zhengquan also said: "In the past, we were busy with these things all day long, but we still couldn't figure it out. I have never seen it like today." The court cadres were also moved and said: "In the past, we couldn't solve it even after transmitting it to the left and transmitting it to the right. Today, relying on the masses to handle cases is really fast and correct." After the judicial reform movement, the People's Court of Chuxiong County adopted this method of handling cases by taking the mass line, and concluded 121 cases in eight days, averaging 15 cases per day. In the past, when sitting in court to interrogate, an average of only 12 cases were concluded per week.

    The People's Court of Chuxiong County also regularly convenes meetings of mediation committee members, explaining that the court will resolutely rely on the masses in handling cases in the future, and explaining policies and laws to them. In this way, on the one hand, the mediation committee members further established the idea of being masters of their own affairs and gave full play to their enthusiasm, and on the other hand, they mastered the policies and could correctly help the court solve problems. Carpenter Li Kunrong is a mediation committee member who often participates in mediation meetings and understands some policies, so he actively helps the court mediate cases. In November of last year, a man named Chen Rulin ran over and said that his wife, Chen Guiying, had kicked him and asked for a divorce. Li Kunrong thought: "The Marriage Law says that the husband cannot file for divorce during the wife's pregnancy? Now Chen Guiying is already seven months pregnant, how can we divorce?" He also thought: "The couple's relationship was not bad before, how could Chen Guiying suddenly kick him?" Therefore, he went to understand the situation and found out that it was just that the couple quarreled and twisted each other a few times, so he went to Chen Rulin and said: "Your wife kicked you, let's go to the health center to check the injury, so that we can deal with it." Chen Rulin insisted on not going because he didn't have any injuries. Li Kunrong went to explain the policy to Chen Rulin together with the street chief, explaining that even if he wanted to divorce, he would have to wait until Chen Guiying had a baby for a year before he could divorce. In this way, Chen Rulin said that he filed for divorce because his mother and Chen Guiying could not get along, and he was not kicked. After mediation, Chen Rulin and Chen Guiying reconciled again. After the judicial reform movement, Li Kunrong alone mediated five disputes. Now Chuxiong County has established 50 district and township mediation committees, with more than 200 mediation committee members. This group of forces has become a powerful assistant in the court's work after being tempered in actual work.

    The People's Court of Chuxiong County has also established a question-and-answer system and set up a question-and-answer office to answer questions raised by the masses and help the masses write complaints. A blackboard newspaper was also set up in front of the court to publicize policies and laws to the masses. In order to listen to the opinions of the masses, six opinion boxes were set up in market towns such as Lucheng Town. In addition, it is planned to hold a meeting of the parties once every two months to solicit opinions on the court's handling of cases.

    After the judicial reform movement, the prestige of the People's Court of Chuxiong County has been unprecedentedly improved. In the past, the masses were unwilling to go to the court to solve problems. The court received an average of 14 cases per month, and the most was only 30 cases in one month. However, in the more than one month after the judicial reform movement, 266 cases were received. Many parties mentioned in their complaints that they had changed their understanding of the court through the judicial reform movement, so they asked the court to help solve problems when something happened.

    依靠群众办案，又快又正确
    ——记云南省楚雄县人民法院在司法改革运动后的变化
    云南省司法改革委员会办公室
    云南省楚雄县人民法院经过了伟大的司法改革运动，已从根本上改变了旧的面貌。在过去，特别在解放初期，这个法院组织不纯的情况是极端严重的。这个人民民主专政的武器，几乎完全被一批坏分子所掌握。曾当过三次伪县长的旧官僚和血债累累的大恶霸，曾先后混进来担任领导工作。经过历次的社会改革运动，这种严重的情况虽然有了一些改变，但组织上仍旧是很不纯的。到司法改革运动的前夕，全院九个干部中，尚有反革命分子两名，旧官僚一人，旧司法人员三人。由于组织不纯，思想不纯的情况也是非常严重的。这些人除了包庇反革命与贪赃枉法外，在办案中更处处表现出旧法观点与旧司法作风。一些旧司法人员曾经公开地以“新法尚未颁布”为理由，向上级书面请求“仍以六法适用”。这个荒谬的请求虽未得到批准，但是实际上他们办案时仍旧是按照伪法院的一套，颠倒是非，歪曲政策，只是坐堂问案，对群众拍桌瞪眼。个别新参加工作的农民干部处在这个环境中，也染上了这种恶习。这样就使人民法院完全丧失了它应有的作用，以致群众反映说：人民法院和国民党时代的法院差不多。
    楚雄县是西南地区第一个展开司法改革运动的县，经过三个月的组织整顿与思想改造，现在无论在组织上、思想上、制度上都有了本质上的改变。该县在运动中先后处理了四个包庇反革命、贪赃枉法和有严重旧法观点与旧司法作风的坏分子；同时又调进来六个从剿匪、土地改革、清理积案中锻炼出来的坚强干部。现在法院中共有干部十一人，其中有党员一人，团员四人，在组织上基本纯洁与健全起来了。
    在运动中，该院曾展开对旧法观点与旧司法作风的尖锐斗争与批判，提高了干部对人民法院工作性质的认识，划清了新旧法律的原则界限。审判员樊树春是一个青年学生出身的干部，一九五一年五月到人民法院工作。在司法改革运动以前，他不晓得法院工作的重要，特别是跟旧司法人员、旧官僚在一起工作，更感到苦闷。因此，逢人就说：“在法院作这个倒霉的事，到哪里也被人瞧不起。”在司法改革运动中，他经过教育，又看见揭发出来大量的严重问题，才开始感到法院工作并不如自己从前所想像的那样不重要。以后看到坏的干部都调了出去，好的干部调了进来，就更感到工作有了前途。因此他不但在运动中积极检查自己与帮助别人，而且在运动后完全改变了过去的消极态度。审判员李国顺是一个雇工出身的干部，在司法改革运动以前，由于受了周围旧司法人员的影响，作了旧法的俘虏。一九五一年二月，有一个妇女因受丈夫周正安残酷虐待，跳埧自杀身死。但李国顺当时在旧法思想支配下，采取了不告不理的态度。司法改革运动以后，他又听到群众反映两年来有三个妇女因不堪虐待而跳埧自杀。这时他想，现在可不能再不告不理了。因此就通过一些女青年团员，耐心地教育群众，使大家明白犯罪分子不予以法律制裁，即不能保障妇女生命安全的道理。这样大家就积极起来检举，搞清了周正安虐待妇女，逼妻自杀的全部案情，把周正安逮捕法办了。事后还为此召开了一个座谈会，教育群众。有一个经常虐待老婆的胡朝章说：“以后可不能再虐待了。”
    在司法改革运动以前，法院干部从来没有想到过依靠群众来办案。解放后三年来楚雄县人民法院完全是坐堂问案，闭门审讯，不但不主动地依靠群众，有时群众到法院作证帮助解决案子时，也被骂为“帮凶”，因此好些案件得不到解决，或者处理错了。司法改革运动以后，法院首先把过去积压下来的六十件案子，分区、分性质整理出来，携卷下乡巡回就审，集体调解。审判员白凤春过去坐堂问案，平均每日结不到一件案子；但是这次他到二区河前乡去，开了两个晚上的会，就解决了婚姻案十六件。他下去的时候，正碰上农民赶交爱国公粮，整天都找不到人，但他并没有向困难低头，他白天帮助农民交公粮，顺便就了解一些情况，摸清当事人的底，晚上他召集调解委员、积极分子和当事人开会，首先说明政策，然后由当事人协商。从前在法院里当事人总喜欢大吵大闹，但现在双方检讨后就自行和解了；和解不了时，调解委员就帮助说服，该离的就离了，不该离的双方也就同意不离。结果十六件婚姻案子只判决了一件，而且当事人都是口服心服。从前法院因不交代政策，勉强地作了判决，时常难以执行，特别是妇女离婚后的财产问题，执行上困难更多。但是现在经过调解与判决后，离婚的妇女就可以立即拿东西，有些男方还自动把女方应得的财产送到乡上来。妇女徐兰英与彭发贵离婚的案子，从前虽然经法院判离了，但是财产问题始终没有得到处理。这一次彭发贵起先仍旧说：“我这份财产分给她去了，将来再讨老婆就没有了。”但是群众说：现在有毛主席领导，人人都有一份，她走了带走她的一份，别人来时也会带一份来的。这样就使得彭发贵没有理由再说不给了。第二天徐兰英就请了几个人欢欢喜喜去彭发贵家搬东西，并且高兴地说：“我这个案子从前到区上去了九次，到法院里去了两次，都解决不了。今天法院的同志跑到我们村头来帮我解决了。”乡长周正泉也说：“过去我们整天为这些事情忙，还是搞不清，像今天这个样子真是还没有见到过。”法院干部也感动地说：“过去左传一次，右传一次都解决不了，今天依靠群众办案，真是解决得又快又正确。”楚雄县人民法院在司法改革运动后采取了这种走群众路线的办案方式，八天中就结了一百二十一件案子，平均每日结十五件。过去坐堂问案，每星期平均仅结十二件。
    楚雄县人民法院又经常召集调解委员开会，讲明法院今后办案一定坚决依靠群众，并向他们讲解政策法令。这样，一方面使调解委员进一步树立了当家作主的思想，发挥了积极性，另一方面他们掌握了政策，就能正确地帮助法院解决问题。木工李琨容是一个调解委员，经常参加调解会议，懂得了一些政策，他就积极地帮助法院调解案子。去年十一月间有一个叫陈汝林的，跑来说他的老婆陈桂英踢伤了他，要求离婚。李琨容想：“婚姻法上说过，女方在怀孕期间男方不能提出离婚？现在陈桂英已经怀孕七个月了，怎么可以离婚呢？”他又想：“他们夫妇俩从前感情还不坏，怎么陈桂英又突然会踢伤他呢？”因此他就去了解这个情况，结果晓得只是两口子吵嘴互相扭了几把，于是就去找陈汝林说：“你老婆踢伤了你，我们到卫生院去验验伤，才好处理。”陈汝林因自己并没有什么伤，坚持不去。李琨容就去和街长共同向陈汝林交代政策。说明纵然要离也要等陈桂英生了娃娃一年后才能离。这样陈汝林才说出提出离婚是因为他母亲和陈桂英搞不来，并没有被踢伤。经过调解，陈汝林和陈桂英又重归于好了。在司法改革运动以后，仅李琨容一个人就调解了五件纠纷。现在楚雄全县已建立了五十个区、乡调解委员会，有二百多个调解委员。这一批力量经过在实际工作中的锻炼，已经成了法院工作中的有力助手。
    楚雄县人民法院又建立了问事代书制度，设立了问事代书处。解答群众提出的问题，帮助群众写诉状。又在法院门前设置了黑板报，经常向群众宣传政策法令。为了听取群众意见，又在鹿城镇等集镇设置了六个意见箱。此外并准备每两个月召开当事人会议一次，征求对法院处理案件的意见。
    经过司法改革运动，楚雄县人民法院在群众中的威信空前地提高了。过去群众有事也不愿意找法院给解决，法院每月收案平均十四件，最多的一个月也只收案三十件。但司法改革运动以后的一个多月时间就收案二百六十六件。许多当事人在诉状上都提到自己通过司法改革运动改变了对法院的认识，所以有事就要求法院帮助解决。
