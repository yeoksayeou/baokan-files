Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th - According to TASS Pyongyang, "Labor News" recently published a statement by Kim Sung-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, to the newspaper's reporter, in which he condemned the US Air Force's crimes of indiscriminately bombing the peaceful residents of North Korea and Pyongyang.
Kim Sung-hak said: The US Air Force continues to carry out barbaric air raids on peaceful residential areas of North Korea day and night. After suffering defeats on the front lines, the US aggressors are attempting to vent their anger by destroying Pyongyang and its peaceful residents. Last year, US fighters, jet fighters, and bombers dropped 52,380 bombs of various types on Pyongyang and its suburbs, including napalm bombs and bacteriological bombs.
Kim Sung-hak pointed out that the US Air Force's air raids on Pyongyang last year had these characteristics: (1) Repeatedly bombing areas that had already been destroyed, in a planned manner. (2) Not only using Flying Fortresses in large numbers, but also using fighters in large numbers to destroy air raid shelters and other shelters. (3) Conducting night raids, dropping bombs while people were asleep, in order to slaughter as many women and children as possible.
The executioner Clark and his lackeys are trying to make people believe that US aircraft are only bombing military targets in Korea. However, the facts refute the lies of those murderers. During the war, US aircraft destroyed 42 hospitals, one university, seven educational institutions, 75 schools, and countless homes in Pyongyang. On July 11 alone, US fighters and bombers destroyed the 10th, 38th, and 40th People's Schools, as well as many other schools. Several hospitals and clinics, theaters, the Pyongyang History Museum, and two children's homes were also destroyed on this day. In the past two years, US aerial bandits have carried out six barbaric air raids on the market areas of the city during the day. These are the Pyongyang "military targets" that the Pentagon believes must be destroyed.
Kim Sung-hak pointed out: No matter how rampant the executioners and their lackeys are, they cannot destroy the Korean people's will to resist the aggressors. The heroic citizens of Pyongyang firmly believe that those who directed and committed heinous crimes in Korea will certainly not escape the people's just judgment.

### 平壤市人民委员会委员长发表谈话  痛斥美国滥炸平壤和平居民的卑怯罪行

    平壤市人民委员会委员长发表谈话
    痛斥美国滥炸平壤和平居民的卑怯罪行
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】据塔斯社平壤讯：“劳动新闻”报最近刊载了平壤市人民委员会委员长金成学对该报记者发表的谈话，他在谈话中斥责美国空军滥炸北朝鲜和平壤市的和平居民的罪行。
    金成学说：美国空军继续不分昼夜地对北朝鲜和平居民地区进行野蛮的空袭。美国侵略者在前线上吃了败仗以后，企图用毁灭平壤和平壤居民的办法来泄愤。在去年，美国的战斗机、喷气式战斗机和轰炸机在平壤及近郊投了各种炸弹五万二千三百八十枚，其中有凝固汽油弹和细菌弹等。
    金成学指出：美国空军去年对平壤进行的空袭有这些特点：（一）对那些已被炸毁的地区有计划地一炸再炸。（二）不仅大量使用飞行堡垒，而且还大量使用战斗机以毁灭防空洞和其他掩蔽所。
    （三）进行夜袭，为了屠杀尽可能多的妇孺，美国飞机趁着人民熟睡的时候，投下炸弹。
    刽子手克拉克和他的喽囉们企图使人相信：美国飞机在朝鲜所炸的只是军事目标。然而事实驳斥了那些杀人犯的谎言。在战争期间，美国飞机在平壤炸毁了四十二所医院、一所大学、七所教育机关、七十五所学校以及无数住屋。仅在七月十一日这一天，美国的战斗机和轰炸机就炸毁了第十、第三十八、第四十人民学校以及其他许多学校。好几个医院和医疗所、剧院和平壤历史博物馆以及两所儿童之家也在这一天被炸毁。在过去两年中，美国空中强盗曾在白天对市内的市场区进行过六次野蛮的空袭。这就是五角大楼认为必须炸毁的平壤“军事目标”。
    金成学指出：不管刽子手及其喽囉们怎样的猖獗，他们是不能摧毁朝鲜人民抵抗侵略者的意志的。英勇的平壤市民们坚信：那些在朝鲜境内指使和进行滔天罪行的人们，一定逃不脱人民的正义审判。
