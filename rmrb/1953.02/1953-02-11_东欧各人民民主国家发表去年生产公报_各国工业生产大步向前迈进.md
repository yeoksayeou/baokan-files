The heavy industry sectors of various countries learned from the advanced technology and experience of the Soviet Union and achieved great success. Poland's machine manufacturing industry has been able to master the production of approximately one hundred types of powerful new machines. Czechoslovakia has begun producing automatic welding machines, coal mining combines for mining thin coal seams, and many new types of equipment for the chemical and textile industries. Last year, Romania's production of means of production accounted for 54.4 percent of the total industrial output. Hungary's heavy industry production increased by one-third compared to 1951, and it is now able to produce universal milling machines, powerful track-laying tractors, new-style trolleybuses, and buses.
	The mechanization of agriculture and collectivization of agricultural management continued to develop in various People's Democratic countries. In 1952, Poland added 8,400 fifteen-horsepower tractors to its agriculture, and 350 villages across the country now have electricity. The number of combine harvesters in Hungary tripled, and the area of land harvested using combine harvesters doubled in the past year. Romania established 30 machine tractor stations last year, with agricultural machinery additions including 3,530 tractors and 2,300 cultivators. Last year, more farmers in various countries joined collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives. Romania already has more than 1,600 collective farms. Three-fifths of Bulgaria's cultivated land is farmed by agricultural cooperatives, and 53 percent of farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives. The land cultivated by agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms in Hungary has increased to 37 percent of the country's cultivated land. In terms of agricultural production, although some countries were affected by unfavorable weather last year, they still achieved a bumper harvest. Poland's agricultural harvest increased by 4 percent compared to 1951, and Bulgaria's total harvest in 1952 increased by 11.3 percent compared to the average annual output between 1948 and 1951.
	With the rise in the level of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the people in various People's Democratic countries have further improved. In 1952, Czechoslovakia's national income increased by 15 percent compared to 1951. The people throughout the country purchased 10 percent more grain and 7 percent more bicycles than in 1951. The people in Romania's towns and industrial centers purchased 11.3 percent more bread and 45 percent more meat than in 1951. Bulgaria reduced prices twice in 1952, and the people's purchasing power increased by 22.2 percent. Poland's cultural and social welfare undertakings have developed.
