    A Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Lessons from Failure in Leading Creative Work
    Tian Bing
    Editor's Note: After the nationwide rectification and study movement in literature and art, various regions have paid more attention to literary and artistic creation than before, and organized many writers to go to factories, rural areas, and troops to allow them to come into contact with the practical lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, up to now, many urgent problems still exist in the actual creative activities of writers and the leadership of literary and artistic creation in various regions, and the backward situation of literary and artistic creation is still serious. Several articles published here today are centered on this issue and put forward suggestions for improvement, hoping to provoke discussion and research.
    For more than two years, I have been working in the former Pingyuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Now, with the change in the province's administrative structure, the former Pingyuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has been abolished. Taking this opportunity, I would like to offer the shortcomings and problems I personally saw in the past provincial federation's leadership and organization of creative work.
    The former Pingyuan Province, which was the Jiluyu area during the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, experienced twelve years of arduous seesaw battles, with countless inspiring stories. Most of the literary and art workers in Pingyuan Province were propaganda, education, and news cadres during the war. During the war, whether they were willing to go deep into life or not, the objective situation always pushed them into the crucible of war, so they had a certain understanding of life and wrote many works serving the revolutionary struggle.
    Since the establishment of the province, in the three years of a peaceful environment, the lives of these literary and art cadres have stabilized, and their treatment has improved, but there has been little achievement in creative work, and no decent works have been produced. Everyone feels that what they write is even inferior to what they wrote in the past. Although the work of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles also has its certain achievements, as far as creative work is concerned, it cannot be said to be a failure.
    Why is creation lagging behind? The main reason is of course due to the problems of the literary and art cadres themselves. After liberation, they were eroded by bourgeois ideology, nurtured fame and position concepts, and developed individualistic thoughts. They gradually became detached from politics and reality. May I ask, how can good works be written if thoughts and feelings are not right? In addition to this basic reason, I think there is also a problem with the leadership and organization of creation by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles.
    The leading cadres of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles focused not on how to organize and unite writers to engage in creation, or how to seriously study creative problems, but on being busy with the daily affairs of the organization. What are these affairs? They are: sending off and welcoming guests in the organization, decorating the organization, arranging the courtyard, planting flowers and raising fish, banquets and gatherings… and so on.
    The leading cadres of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles themselves originally had creative abilities, but most of them fell into the quagmire of事務ism. Once the administrative affairs were busy, they talked about eating, drinking, and ostentation. They became detached from the struggle life of the working people and slowly became accustomed to a comfortable and enjoyable way of life, and their creative abilities naturally gradually declined. They cannot create themselves, and they have no intention of leading the masses in creation. When they go down, they do not go deep into the masses; when they come up, they are content to take on some administrative affairs. In this way, three years have passed busily, and no one has written a decent work.
    The organization of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles has only a dozen people, but there are many job titles. There is both a director and a deputy director. Below are the various associations, so there are also directors of the Literary Association, the Art Association, the Drama Association, and the Quyi Association. After the Provincial Congress of Literary and Art Representatives, the various associations were abolished, but the Creation Department, the Editorial Department, the Opera and Music Department, the Traditional Opera Department, and the Art Department were established… Thus, each department set up a batch of ministers, and almost everyone who could create had a name, shouldering some administrative work. When work came, they worked overtime and rushed; when the rush was over, they were lazy, their lives were undisciplined, and some even "made trouble" to compete for a position, to the point of getting sick.
    Of course, in order to carry out literary and artistic work, it is necessary to set up certain positions in the organization. However, these positions have not played the role of organizing and leading creation; they have lost their work content and become nominal.
    Take Quyi (a form of Chinese folk art) as an example. It was originally the most common literary and artistic form in Pingyuan Province, loved by the vast urban and rural masses. In the past war years, the then Federation of Literary and Art Circles had close ties with the vast number of rural drama troupes and folk artists, and organized tens of thousands of artists, producing countless storytelling works to serve the revolutionary war. But after entering the city, the first thing was to cut off contact with the vast number of artists. In this aspect, the working group almost only consisted of a Quyi team and two old opera troupes led by the government. Is the work of this Quyi team and old opera troupe done well? It is not. Some leading comrades have already looked down on and even loathed these artists, abandoned leadership, and wholeheartedly devoted themselves to "star performers": wanting "star performers," pulling "star performers," watching "star performers," and praising "star performers," causing disputes for "star performers." As far as the former Pingyuan Province is concerned, if the Federation of Literary and Art Circles loses contact with the vast number of artists, then its
    "Federation" is very narrow in scope. Strictly speaking, it only "federates" a few people in the organization, and to a greater extent, it only "federates" the heads of the drama troupes and cultural work troupes. Moreover, these people are only "federated" on the surface but not in their hearts. In this way, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles becomes an empty shell, a yamen (government office).
    As far as the entire province's literary and art circles are concerned, there is a lack of a leading core, especially a lack of leading figures who can be role models for the masses in terms of moral character and have the ability to organize creation. The literary and art circles look down on me, and I look down on you, often causing unprincipled disputes, and cannot carry out criticism and self-criticism well. The provincial party committee is busy and has not been able to frequently and comprehensively consider literary and artistic work, and has not attached importance to the work of leading literary and artistic creation and cultivating literary and artistic creation cadres.
    The creative thinking of literary and art workers is also chaotic. Everyone will say: life is the source of creation, without going deep into life, without transforming thoughts and feelings, good works cannot be written. But in their hearts, everyone wants to take a shortcut. Some comrades are unwilling to go down, and they are content to sit in the organization, thinking that reading books and listening to reports can improve their writing skills. Occasionally hearing a story, relying on a little cleverness, they can also write a work. Thus, the saying that life is everywhere has emerged. Some comrades believe that people who go down may not necessarily write good things, and people above can also write "sensational" works. Some comrades go down to experience life, but they do not go deep, and they are even unwilling to eat with the masses. Obtaining a little material, they rush to write, distorting the working people with their petty-bourgeois emotions. This basic problem of creative thinking has not been resolved.
    Despite this, there is still a lot of literary and artistic creation from the masses. When the magazine run by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was still running, it often received a large number of various literary and artistic creations from the masses. However, due to the lack of attention and leadership from the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, these mass creations could not get guidance and were left to fend for themselves. After the magazine was discontinued, the work of guiding mass literary and artistic creation was almost completely abandoned. When the works of the masses were sent up, the负责人 (person in charge) would write a few words, and everyone would circulate them. After a while, they disappeared. Over time, the authors changed their jobs, and they could not find a place to return the manuscripts. In the end, they were burned in a fire.
    The above issues can also be said to be some of the situations I have seen, and they are just my personal feelings from one place, and they may not be correct. Moreover, I was also one of the leaders of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles at the time, and I made serious mistakes in ideological methods, creative viewpoints, going deep into life, leadership thinking, and leadership methods. However, from the situation of the Pingyuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' leadership over creation, it can be seen that there are several issues that need to be studied and resolved. These are:
    1. What kind of organizational form of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, or rather, what kind of leadership thinking and leadership methods of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, should be conducive to carrying out literary and artistic activities? How can it be more convenient for the creation of literary and art cadres and the guidance of the creation of the masses?
    2. How should the leadership of the provincial party committee be conducive to cultivating creative cadres and carrying out creative movements, so that it is suitable for the national situation and the needs of the people?
    3. How should the issues of the standpoint, creative methods, detachment from reality, etc., exposed by the creation cadres in the literary and artistic rectification and study, be thoroughly resolved in practical training? Should the administrative work and lifestyles of creative cadres be changed?
    These issues are awaiting research by relevant departments and literary and artistic workers in various regions.

    一个省文联在领导创作工作上的失败教训
    田兵
    编者按：全国文艺整风学习运动以后，各地对文艺创作已较前重视，组织了不少作家到工厂去，到农村去，到部队去，使他们接触工、农、兵的生活实际。但直到目前为止，在作家们的实际创作活动和各地对文艺创作的领导上，仍然存在着许多急待解决的问题，文艺创作落后的情况仍是严重的。今天在这里发表的几篇文章都是围绕着这一问题提出改进的意见，希望能引起讨论和研究。
    两年多来，我一直在前平原省文学艺术界联合会工作。现在，随着省的建制的改变，过去的平原省文联已经撤销，趁这个时候，我愿把个人见到的过去省文联在领导和组织创作工作方面所存在的缺点和问题提供出来。
    前平原省，也就是抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期的冀鲁豫区，曾经经过十二年拉锯式的苦战，有数不完的可歌可泣的故事。平原省的文艺工作者，大部是战争时期的宣传、教育和新闻干部。在战争中，他们愿意深入生活也好，不愿意深入生活也好，客观形势总是把他们推到了战争的洪炉里去，因此他们都有一定的生活感受，写了不少为革命斗争服务的作品。
    自从建了省，在三年的和平环境中，这些文艺干部的生活安定了，待遇提高了，可是在创作方面却很少成绩，没有产生过像样的作品。大家觉得，写出来的东西甚至于不如过去。省文联的工作虽则也有它一定的成绩，但就创作方面来看，不能不说是一个失败。
    创作为什么落后呢？主要当然是由于文艺干部本身的问题。解放以后，他们受到了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，滋长了名位观念，产生了个人主义思想。他们逐渐脱离政治，脱离实际。试问，思想情感不对头，怎么能写出好作品来？除了这个基本原因之外，我觉得另外还有一个文联的领导和组织创作的问题。
    省文联领导干部着眼的不是如何组织和团结写作的人从事创作，如何认真地研究创作问题，而是忙于机关日常事务。这些事务是什么呢？就是：机关的送往迎来，机关的装璜，布置庭院，栽花养鱼，宴会聚餐……等等。
    文联的领导干部本身原是有创作能力的，但多数陷入了事务主义的泥坑。行政事务一忙完，就讲吃，讲喝，讲排场。他们脱离了劳动人民的斗争生活，慢慢地习惯于安逸享受的生活方式，创作能力自然也就逐渐衰退了。自己创作不出来，也无心去领导群众创作。他们下去的时候，不深入群众；上来的时候，安于担任一部分行政事务。就这样，三年来忙忙碌碌的过去，谁也没有写出像样的作品。
    文联的编制只有十几个人，职位名堂却搞了不少。既有正主任，又有副主任。下面分设了各个协会，也就有了文协主任、美协主任、剧协主任、曲协主任。省文代大会后，取消了各个协会，却又成立了创作部、编辑部、戏音部、戏曲部、美术部……于是，各部又设了一批部长，几乎凡是能创作的人，都有一个名义，担负一些行政工作，工作来了就开夜车，突击；突击过去了，就懒散，生活不检点，甚至有的为了争当一个职位，而“闹情绪”，以致生病。
    当然，为了开展文艺工作，在机关内设立一定的职位，是有其需要的。但是，这些职位，没有发挥组织和领导创作的作用；失去了它的工作内容，就变成有名无实了。
    就拿曲艺来说，它原是平原省最普遍的文艺形式，为广大的城市和农村人民群众所喜爱。在过去的战争时期，当时的文联曾和广大的农村剧团和民间艺人密切联系，曾经组织了成千成万的艺人，产生了无数的说唱作品，为革命战争服务。可是进城以后，首先就是割断了和广大艺人的联系。在这方面的工作团体就几乎只剩了由政府领导的一个曲艺队和两个旧剧团。这个曲艺队和旧剧团的工作，是不是就做的好了呢？也不是的。有的领导同志，已经看不起甚至厌恶这些艺人，放弃了领导，一味地醉心于“名角”：想“名角”，拉“名角”，看“名角”，捧“名角”，为了“名角”而闹纠纷。就前平原省来说，文联如果失去了和广大艺人的联系，那么它
    “联”的范围就十分狭窄。严格的说，只是“联”了本机关的几个人，扩大一些说，也不过“联”了剧团和文工团的负责人。而且，这些人也只是面“联”心不“联”。这样，省文联就变成一个空架子、一个衙门。
    就整个省的文艺界来说，就是缺少一个领导核心，特别是缺少在道德品质上，能为群众楷模，并且有组织创作的能力的领导人物。文艺界你看不起我，我看不起你，常闹无原则的纠纷，不能很好地展开批评和自我批评。省委工作忙，未能经常地、全面地考虑文艺工作，未能把领导文艺创作，培养文艺创作干部的工作，重视起来。
    文艺工作者的创作思想也是混乱的。谁的嘴上都会说：生活是创作的源泉，不深入生活，不能改造思想情感，不能写出好作品来。但是内心里谁也想走个巧路。有的同志不愿下去，安心坐机关，认为看看书听听报告，就可以提高自己的写作水平。偶尔听到个故事，依靠一点小聪明，也能写出一个作品来。于是产生了到处都是生活的说法。有的同志认为：下去的人不一定写出好东西，在上面的人一样可以写出“轰动”的作品。有的同志下去体验生活，却并不深入，甚至吃饭都不愿和群众在一起。得到一点材料，就忙着写作，用自己小资产阶级的情感去歪曲劳动人民。这个创作思想的基本问题，一直没有解决。
    尽管是这样，来自群众的文艺创作还是很多的。文联办的刊物还没有停的时候，经常收到大批从群众中来的各种各样的文艺创作。可是由于省文联不重视，也不领导，这些群众创作，就得不到指导，自生自灭。到刊物停后，指导群众文艺创作的工作几乎完全废弃。群众的作品送上来，负责人批几个字，大家传阅。传一阵子就没了下文。时间久了，作者改变了工作岗位，找不到地方退稿，最后是一把火烧掉了事。
    以上几个问题，也可说是个人见到的一些情况，只是我一人一地的感觉，不一定对。况且当时我也是省文联的领导人之一，不论在思想方法上，创作观点上，深入生活上，领导思想和领导方法上，都犯有严重的错误。但是从平原省文联对创作领导的情况，可以看出有几个问题是必需研究和解决的。这就是：
    一、省文联的组织形式，或者说是省文联的领导思想领导方法，应该怎样才便于开展文艺活动？才更便利于文艺干部的创作和指导群众的创作？
    二、省委的领导，应该怎样才便于培养创作干部、开展创作运动，使它适合于国家形势和人民的需要？
    三、创作干部在文艺整风学习中所暴露出来的立场问题，创作方法问题，脱离实际等等问题，应该怎样才能在实际锻炼中彻底解决？创作干部的行政工作、生活方式是否应该改变？
    这些问题，都待有关部门和各地文艺工作者加以研究。
