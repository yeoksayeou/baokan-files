    The Tianlan Railway Activates Material Exchange in the Northwest
    Liu Chao
    The Tianlan Railway organically connects Lanzhou, the transportation and economic center of the Northwest, with all parts of the country, opening up a new situation for material exchange in the Northwest region.
    The Northwest is extremely rich in native products, with an estimated variety of over 500 types. Many native products not only supply the entire country but also supply the international market in large quantities. The oil, wool, casings, camel hair, and hides produced in the Northwest are especially well-known throughout the country. According to statistics, the total value of native products produced annually in Gansu alone reaches over 3.8 trillion yuan, with an average of over 370,000 yuan per person in the province. In the past, these native products relied on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway for transportation, but the transportation capacity of the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway was insufficient, and the freight was too high, which seriously affected the production and sales of native products. To solve the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity, a waterway from Lanzhou to Baotou was once opened. In the past, the large amount of natural alkali from Ningxia and crystal salt from Qinghai needed by the Xi'an market were transported by the Yellow River to Baotou, and then transported to Xi'an via the Beijing-Suiyuan, Beijing-Hankou, and Longhai railways, taking a large detour. In the past three years, the Yellow River waterway has increased thirtyfold, and 70% of the automobiles in the Northwest have been concentrated on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway for transportation, but it still cannot meet the increasing freight needs. Qinghai Trading Company often has 600,000 to 700,000 jin of wool stockpiled and unable to be shipped out. Borax from Qinghai is an important raw material for welding in heavy industry and glass in light industry, but it is expensive to transport to the interior, and sales are sluggish. Due to the high freight costs, many valuable native products in the Northwest have been unable to find a market for a long time. According to statistics, 45% of the total value of Qinghai's native products are滞销due to inconvenient transportation. On the other hand, the machinery, industrial products, and grain needed by the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest cannot be transported in a timely and large quantity. The price of industrial products in Lanzhou is generally one-third higher than in the place of origin. Since liberation, due to the increasing economic life of ethnic minorities, the demand for grain has greatly increased, and the supply of grain in pastoral areas cannot meet the demand, while the surplus grain in the Guanzhong grain-producing area cannot be transported westward in large quantities. Wheat in Lanzhou costs 1,270 yuan per jin, while wheat in eastern Gansu only sells for 650 yuan per jin.
    After the opening of the Tianlan Railway, not only did it reduce local freight rates, but it also diverted the automobiles on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway to other highways in the Northwest, greatly solving the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity. According to statistics, the train freight from Lanzhou to Xi'an is only one-seventh of the automobile freight. From Tianshui to Lanzhou, the automobile freight for transporting a bag of flour is 63,700 yuan, while the train freight is only 4,195 yuan. The automobile freight for transporting one ton of coal is 610,000 yuan, while the train freight is only 93,560 yuan. Due to the reduction in freight costs, the Northwest Trade Department has planned to appropriately reduce the list prices of 57 major industrial products in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. The ratio of industrial product prices to local native product prices has changed, and native product prices have relatively increased.
    After the opening of the Tianlan Railway, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of private merchants in operating native products. After last year's National Day, the material exchange conference jointly held by Xi'an City and Shaanxi Province was enthusiastically attended by minority trade delegations from Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other places. At the Second Material Exchange Conference in North China last October, the Qinghai minority trade delegation appeared for the first time. They sold native products such as sheepskin, lambskin, deer antlers, feathers, and tiger bones (valuable medicines), and purchased daily necessities such as woolen hats, linen hats, and twill fabric needed by ethnic minorities, with a total transaction volume of over 1 billion yuan. Private merchants from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan and other places have successively penetrated into the Northwest, especially into the primary markets of Gansu, to purchase native products in large quantities, and brought various native products from outside the region that are welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, thereby enlivening the material exchange in the Northwest. According to statistics for the 55 days after the opening of the Tianlan Railway: more than 44,500 tons of native products such as mineral oil, salt, wool, and medicinal materials were transported from Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai through the Tianlan Railway, and a total of 57,746 tons of machinery, cement, grain, cotton, daily necessities, etc. were transported to the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an increase of more than fourteen times compared to the goods transported through the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway in the past two months.
    In order to further develop material exchange in the Northwest and improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are actively building a transportation network with the Tianlan Railway as the main line. In addition to continuing to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and repairing the original highways in the Northwest, the newly completed roads include: the Dingxi-Hui (Ning) highway, the Lanzhou-Agan Town highway, and the Linxia-Xiahe section of the highway from Lanzhou to Labrang, the trading center for Tibetan people on the border of Gansu and Qinghai. The roads under construction include the highway from Lanzhou to Minxian (Gansu's largest medicinal material distribution center) and the highway from Tianshui to Zhangjiachuan (fur distribution center). The opening of these highways will play an important role in the centralized transportation of native products from the vast agricultural and pastoral areas of the Northwest and the distribution of industrial products to farmers and herdsmen.
    Correction:
    In the "Report on the 1953 National Budget" on page 2 of this newspaper on the 18th, in the 15th line of the fifth paragraph in the first column, "依法避免" should be "依法减免"; in the table in the second column, the percentage of "Total Revenue" in 1952 "二七一·六○" should be "二七二·六○".

    天兰铁路活跃了西北的物资交流
    柳超
    天兰铁路把西北交通、经济中心的兰州和全国各地有机地联系起来，开辟了西北区物资交流的新局面。
    西北的土特产极为丰富，据统计约有五百多种。许多土特产品不仅供应全国，并大量供应国际市场。西北出产的石油、羊毛、肠衣、驼毛、皮张等，更是全国闻名的。据统计，仅甘肃年产的土特产总值，就达三万八千多亿元，该省每人平均可得三十七万元以上。这些土特产过去依靠西（安）兰（州）公路运输，但西兰公路的运输力不足，且运费过高，严重地影响了土特产的生产与销路。为了解决运输力不足的困难，过去曾经开辟了从兰州到包头的水路。西安市场上大量需要的宁夏天然碱和青海水晶盐，过去一直都是由黄河水运包头，经京绥、京汉、陇海等铁路，绕了一个大圈运抵西安。三年来黄河水运增加了三十倍，西兰公路上集中了西北百分之七十的汽车参加运输，但仍不能满足日益增长的货运需要。青海贸易公司经常有六、七十万斤羊毛积压着不能外运。青海的硼砂是重工业电焊及轻工业玻璃的重要原料，但运到内地，成本很高，销路不畅。因为运费过高，西北许多贵重的土特产长期找不到销路。据统计青海因交通不便而滞销的土特产占土特产总值的百分之四十五。另一方面，西北各族人民需要的机器、工业品、粮食等，又不能及时地大量地运进来。兰州的工业品的价格一般比产地高三分之一。解放以来，由于少数民族经济生活日益上升，粮食需要量大增，牧区粮食供不应求，而关中粮食产区的余粮却不能大量西运。兰州的麦子每斤一千二百七十元，陇东的麦子每斤才卖六百五十元。
    天兰铁路通车后，不仅降低了当地的运价，而且使西兰公路上的汽车疏散到西北其他公路上，大大地解决了运输力不足的困难。据统计：一般商品从兰州运到西安，火车运费只相当于汽车运费的七分之一。从天水到兰州，运一袋面粉，汽车运费六万三千七百多元，火车运费只四千一百九十五元。运一吨煤，汽车运费六十一万元，火车运费只九万三千五百六十元。由于运费减低了，西北贸易部有计划地将甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆各地五十七种主要工业品适当降低了牌价。工业品与当地土特产品的比价起了变化，土特产品价格相对提高了。
    天兰铁路通车后，大大地鼓舞了私商经营土特产的积极性。去年国庆节以后，西安市与陕西省联合召开的物资交流大会，甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等地的少数民族贸易代表团都踊跃参加了。去年十月里在华北的第二届物资交流大会上，第一次出现了青海少数民族贸易代表团。他们卖出了绵羊皮、羔皮、鹿茸、羽毛、虎骨（贵重药品）等土特产，购进了少数民族需要的呢绒帽、麻绒呢帽、斜纹布等日用百货，购销额达十亿多元。上海、广州、天津、北京、青岛、杭州、四川、山西、河南等地的私商都相继深入西北，特别是深入到甘肃的初级市场去大量收购土特产，并带来了西北各族人民欢迎的外区的各种土特产，从而活跃了西北的物资交流。据天兰铁路通车后五十五天的统计：从甘肃、宁夏、青海各地，经过天兰铁路运出的矿物油、食盐、羊毛、药材等土特产共达四万四千五百多吨，运向甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆四省的机械、水泥、粮食、棉花、日用百货等共达五万七千七百四十六吨，比过去两月通过西兰公路运去的商品增加了十四倍多。
    为了进一步开展西北的物资交流，改善各族人民的生活，西北各族人民正在人民政府领导下，积极地修筑以天兰铁路为干线的交通网。除继续修筑兰（州）新（疆）铁路及整修西北原有各公路外，现在新筑完工的有：定（西）会（宁）公路，兰（州）阿（干镇）公路和兰州通到甘肃、青海边境藏民贸易中心拉卜楞的公路的临（夏）夏（河）段。正在赶筑的有从兰州通向岷县（甘肃最大的药材集散地）的公路，从天水通向张家川（皮毛集散地）的公路。这些公路的通车，对西北辽阔的农、牧区土特产的集中外运，以及使工业品分散到农牧民手里，将起很重要的作用。更　正十八日本报二版“关于一九五三年国家预算的报告”中第一栏第五段第十五行“依法避免”应为“依法减免”；第二栏表中“总收入”项下一九五二年的百分比“二七一·六○”，应为“二七二·六○”。
