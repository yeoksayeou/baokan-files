Everyone Cooperates and Supports Basic Construction

Editor's Note: Below are three letters regarding how to solve the problems of postal delivery, remittance, and savings for workers at basic construction sites. These include opinions and practices from the central and Beijing postal and banking leading organizations on solving these problems, as well as an introduction to the experience of the Tianjin Post Office in carrying out business at construction sites. Solving the problems of postal delivery, remittance, and savings for workers at basic construction sites is an important task for postal and banking departments to cooperate with and support basic construction. We hope that the postal bureaus and People's Banks of all provinces and cities will pay attention to this work. At the same time, we hope that workers, trade unions, and administrative cadres at all construction sites will continue to care for and help relevant business departments carry out this work, and promptly reflect new situations, new problems, and experiences and lessons in this regard to us.

This is a Good Thing That Achieves Three Goals at Once
—The Experience of the Tianjin Post Office in Carrying Out Business at Construction Sites

Editor: Since the spring of 1952, the Tianjin Post Office began to carry out postal and remittance services at construction sites and has already achieved great success.

The construction sites in Tianjin are mostly in the suburbs, far from the city, and most of the workers are from other places. Every month they have to send money home two or three times. To send money, they not only have to travel a long way and spend a lot of money on transportation, but also delay their work. After learning about this situation, the Tianjin Post Office decided to extend its services to the construction sites.

The main method for the Tianjin Post Office to extend its services to construction sites is to regularly send service personnel to the construction sites to handle registered mail and remittance services, and also to handle book and magazine subscriptions. Because these are all urgently needed by the workers, the service personnel are warmly welcomed by the workers every time they go to a construction site. For example, when the postal service personnel first arrived at the "Workers' New Village" construction site last year, as soon as they explained their purpose, the workers used a loudspeaker to broadcast the news to all work sites, and held a special meeting to introduce the service business and working hours of the postal service personnel. The workers happily said: Now we don't have to go to the city to send money, we can save time to do more work, and the houses can be built ahead of schedule!

In order not to affect the workers' work, the service personnel generally work during the workers' rest time; sometimes they have to work until late at night. The workers, without waiting for them to finish their work, make their beds, put up mosquito nets, and prepare food and drinks for them, providing meticulous hospitality.

Once, the postal service personnel at the Port Authority construction site worked until twelve o'clock at night, but they had to rush back that night. The security comrades at the construction site enthusiastically sent him back to the post office. Later, all the workers at this construction site moved to another work area, and some workers specifically requested that this service personnel also go to their new construction site to serve them.

As early as 1951, the Tianjin Post Office solved the difficulties of sending letters and money for the workers of the brick kiln factory. In the past, whenever it rained or was cloudy, many workers would go to the post office to send letters and money. After inquiring, the service personnel learned that they were all workers from the kiln factory, because they were not free on ordinary days and could only brave the wind and rain to enter the city to send letters and remittances when they could not work on rainy and cloudy days. In order to solve the practical difficulties of the kiln factory workers, the post office began to try out periodic service operations at the kiln factory construction site. When the service personnel first arrived at the Xiangtai Kiln Factory, the workers were extremely happy. The work of the service personnel received a lot of help from the workers. Several times, when the service personnel finished their work and wanted to return to the urban area, because the road was difficult to walk after the rain, the workers drove a small boat to send him back to the urban area. This work not only provided great convenience to the workers, but also reduced the absenteeism rate of workers, which was of great benefit to production.

Since the work of the post office is warmly welcomed by the workers, the business has developed rapidly. The postal service personnel issued more than 40 million yuan in small-denomination money orders when they first went to the Xiangtai Kiln Factory construction site. The service personnel who went to the Port Authority construction site once received more than 120 insured letters alone.

Since the post office launched this service work, because it is beneficial to the workers, the construction units, and the post office's business, some people say that this is a good thing that achieves three goals at once. At present, the Tianjin Post Office is preparing to vigorously strengthen this work. Xiao Liankui Zhao Ruitang

People's Bank of China Beijing Branch
Prepares to Establish a Mobile Savings Group at Construction Sites

Editor: After reading the suggestion of Comrade Zhang Fangtian and others in the "Reader's Letter Column" on January 14, that "Post offices and People's Banks should go deep into construction sites to solve the difficulties of workers in sending letters and remittances," we immediately studied specific practices. Regarding savings issues, our Savings Department is conducting investigations at construction sites. We plan to adopt methods such as sending external personnel deep into construction sites, establishing mobile savings groups or establishing temporary savings institutions at construction sites, depending on the number of workers at each construction site, to solve the difficulties of workers in depositing and withdrawing funds. After the investigation is completed, this work can begin. Regarding remittance issues, because banking institutions are not as widespread in rural areas as post offices, in accordance with the spirit of division of labor and cooperation between banks and post offices in remittance business, the central government has stipulated that individual small-denomination remittances should be handled uniformly by post offices. Therefore, we will no longer carry out this business.

People's Bank of China Beijing Branch Office

Editor's Note: It is very good that the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China is preparing to go deep into construction sites to solve the savings problems of workers. According to a letter from the head office of the People's Bank of China, the head office of the People's Bank of China has instructed the branches of all provinces and cities to cooperate with local post offices to go deep into construction sites and carry out savings business. It is hoped that the People's Banks of all provinces and cities will formulate appropriate methods based on the specific conditions of their localities and quickly launch this business to meet the general requirements of workers at various construction sites.

Beijing Post Office Contacts Construction Units
Begins to Solve Postal Delivery and Remittance Problems at Construction Sites

Editor: After your newspaper reflected the difficulties of workers at construction sites in sending letters and remittances, our bureau has contacted units such as the North China Directly Subordinate First Engineering Company (formerly the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company), the Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Beijing Construction Company. After the winter training of each company is completed and the allocation plan for construction projects and workers in 1953 is determined, we can begin to solve this problem in a unified manner.

As for the problem of the Third Work Area of the former North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, we have sent people to contact and negotiate, and have agreed on the following temporary solutions: First, install a post office mailbox in the work area, and we will send someone to open it every day so that workers can send letters at any time. Second, the Haidian Post Office will prepay part of the stamps to the receiving and dispatching room of the work area for them to sell on behalf of the post office. This way, workers can buy stamps at any time. Third, the Wanshousi Postal Agency, which is not far from the work area, will add small-denomination remittance services. Workers can go nearby to handle scattered remittances or send registered mail. Fourth, if workers have large remittances after receiving their salaries, they can notify our bureau by telephone at any time, and we can also send someone to collect the remittances.

Beijing Post Office

Editor's Note: According to a letter from the Postal General Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, the bureau will notify post offices in various places to carry out letter and remittance services at construction sites.

    大家都来配合和支援基本建设
    编者按：下面发表的是关于怎样解决基本建设工地工人邮递、汇兑、储蓄等问题的三封来信。其中有中央及北京市邮政、银行领导机关对解决这方面的问题的意见和做法，有天津市邮局在工地开展业务的经验介绍。解决基本建设工地工人的邮递、汇兑、储蓄等问题，是邮政和银行部门配合和支援基本建设的一项重要工作。我们希望各省、市邮政局和人民银行重视这一工作，同时希望各工地工人、工会和行政干部继续关心并帮助有关业务部门开展这一工作，并随时把这一方面的新情况、新问题和经验教训反映给我们。
    这是一举三得的好事情
    —天津邮局在工地开展业务的经验
    编辑同志：一九五二年春季天津邮局开始在建筑工地开展邮递和汇兑业务，已经有了很大成绩。
    天津市的建筑工地，大都在郊区，离城很远，同时工人多半是外乡人，每个月他们都要往家里寄两三回钱。为了寄钱，他们不仅要跑很多路，花不少车钱，还要耽误工作。天津邮局了解到这种情况，便决定把业务开展到工地中去。
    天津邮局向工地开展业务的主要方法，是定期派服务员到工地去办理挂号信件和汇款业务，同时兼办书刊订购业务。因为这都是工人们迫切需要的，服务员每到一个工地都受到工人们的热烈欢迎。如去年邮政服务员第一次到“工人新村”工地时，他刚说明来意，工人就用广播器把这个消息播送到各个工作现场，并召集了一个大会，专门介绍了邮政服务员的服务业务和工作时间。工人们高兴地说：这回可不用到城里去寄款了，省出时间来多干点活，房子也可提前盖好！
    为了不影响工人的工作，服务员一般都是在工人休息的时间办公；有时他们要一直工作到深夜。工人们则不等他们工作完了，便给他们铺好床铺，挂好蚊帐，预备好吃的和喝的东西，招待得无微不至。
    有一次邮政服务员在港务局工地一直工作到夜间十二点钟，但是夜间又必须赶回去，工地警卫同志便热情地把他送回邮局。后来，这个工地的工人全部迁移到另一工区，有的工人还特别提出来，请这位服务员也到他们新的工地去服务。
    早在一九五一年，天津邮局就为砖窑厂的工人们解决了寄信、汇钱的困难。过去，每当下雨阴天，就有很多工人到邮局去寄信、汇钱。服务员一打听，知道他们都是窑厂的工人，因为平常日子没有空，只有下雨阴天不能干活的时候才能冒着风雨进城寄信、汇款。为了解决窑厂工人的实际困难，邮局便开始在窑厂工地试行开办定期服务业务。服务员第一次到达祥泰窑厂时，工人们都高兴极了。服务员的工作得到工人们很多帮助。有几次，服务员工作完了要回市区，因为雨后道路不好走，工人们就驾着小船把他送回市区。这项工作不但给了工人们很大便利，同时也使工人缺勤率减少，对生产也有很大好处。
    邮局的工作既然受到工人们的热烈欢迎，业务也就开展得很快。邮政服务员第一次到祥泰窑厂工地去，就开出了四千多万元的小额汇票。到港务局工地去的服务员，有一次仅保价信就收寄了一百二十多封。
    邮局开展这项服务工作以来，因为对工人、对建筑单位和邮局的业务都有好处，所以有人说这是一举三得的好事情。目前天津邮局正准备大力加强这项工作。萧联魁　赵瑞堂
    人民银行北京分行
    准备设立工地储蓄流动小组
    编辑同志：我们看了一月十四日“读者来信专页”所载张房钿等同志提出的“邮局和人民银行应深入工地为工人解决寄信汇款等困难”的建议以后，立即研究了具体做法。关于储蓄问题，我行储蓄部正在工地进行调查。我们准备根据各个建筑工地工人的多少，采用外勤深入工地，在工地设立储蓄流动小组或成立临时储蓄机构等办法，来解决工人存、取款项的困难。等调查结束后，这项工作即可着手进行。关于汇款问题，因为银行机构在农村中不如邮局普遍，根据银行和邮局关于汇款业务分工合作的精神，中央已规定个人小额汇款由邮局统一办理。因此，我们就不再开展这项业务了。
                            中国人民银行北京分行办公室
    编者按：中国人民银行北京分行准备深入工地解决工人储蓄问题，这是很好的。据中国人民银行总行来信称，人民银行总行已指示各省、市分行配合当地邮局，深入建筑工地，开展储蓄业务。希望各省、市人民银行根据当地具体情况，定出适当的办法，迅速展开这一业务，以满足各建筑工地工人的普遍要求。
    北京邮局和建筑单位联系
    着手解决工地邮递汇兑问题编辑同志：
    贵报反映了建筑工地工人寄信、汇款有不少困难的情况后，我局已与华北直属第一工程公司（按即原华北基本建设工程公司），中央建筑工程部直属工程公司，北京市建筑公司等单位进行联系，等各公司冬训结束，一九五三年建筑工程和工人的调配计划确定后，我们即可着手统一解决这个问题。
    至于原华北基本建设工程公司第三工区的问题，我们已派人前往联系洽商，并商定了以下临时解决办法：一、先在该工区安装邮政信箱一只，我们每天派人开取，以便工人随时寄信。二、由海甸邮局预付该工区收发室一部分邮票，由他们代售。这样工人们可以随时买到邮票。三、令距该工区不远的万寿寺邮政代办所添办小额汇兑业务。工人们零星汇款或交寄挂号信件，可以就近前往办理。四、工人们发薪金后如有大宗汇款，可随时用电话通知我局，我们还可以派人前往收汇。                                                            
                                                北京邮局
    编者按：据中央人民政府邮电部邮政总局来信称：该局将通知各地邮局，开展建筑工地寄信、汇兑业务。
