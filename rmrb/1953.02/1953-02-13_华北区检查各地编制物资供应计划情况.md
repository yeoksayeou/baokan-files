The North China Regional Planning Committee, in order to strengthen the planning of material supply work throughout the region, dispatched staff members to various provinces and cities in the North China region in the second half of 1952 to assist in the preparation of the 1953 material supply plan. At the same time, they inspected the plan preparation in various regions.

When the North China Regional Planning Committee inspected the preparation of material supply plans in various regions, it found that administrative departments and enterprises at all levels generally emphasized production plans but not material supply plans. Many leading cadres in various units believed that after the production plan was determined, the material supply plan could be compiled by a few people doing planning work with simple calculations. Therefore, the general material supply plan was seriously divorced from reality. Most of them adopted the principle of "rather more than less" for the materials needed, so the plan was extremely inaccurate and the implementation was very chaotic. Many units, when preparing the 1953 material supply plan, did not study the material usage in 1952, did not investigate how much material was left over from 1952, and did not blindly make excessive demands based on a certain quota of required materials. For example, the quota of materials required by the Shijiazhuang Power Plant in Hebei Province for manufacturing road rollers was based on subjective estimation, and even the factory director did not know what it was based on. The Shijiazhuang Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory also arbitrarily set the quota of iron material required to manufacture each 7-inch plow at 57 kilograms, more than twice the actual required 27 kilograms. The material consumption quota in the plan of the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory even completely copied the material consumption quota of the Shanghai Enamel Factory as a basis. Because the material supply plan was inaccurate, there were many cases of constant changes in the plans of various units, even as many as three or four times. This caused chaos in the work. For example, when the whole region carried out the pre-allocation of materials for the first quarter of 1953, Suiyuan Province requested a reduction of more than 8,000 tons of cement when the order was about to end; Qinhuangdao City originally applied for 5,000 tons of cement, but the result was changed to 28 tons; Beijing originally applied for 52,486 tons of coal, but later changed it to 30,576 tons; the Hebei Province Cooperative originally applied for 34 boilers, but later cancelled them all; Tianjin originally applied for 322.4 tons of flat steel, but only ordered 15 tons.

From the perspective of organizational work, the reason for the above phenomenon is that the material supply organization in North China is very unsound and inadequate. For example, the Material Distribution Section of the North China Regional Planning Committee not only had to handle the material distribution work in the entire North China region, but also had to handle foreign orders, warehouse clearing, and other tasks. However, when the section started to handle business in the second half of 1952, there were only 18 staff members, most of whom were transferred cadres and students who had just started working. They did not understand the situation and were not familiar with the business, so they could not cope with the heavy tasks. The Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economic Committees have not yet established a material distribution section, and only seven or eight people are managing material supply work. In Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces, except for Shanxi Province, which has a material distribution team of three people, the material supply organization in Hebei and Suiyuan provinces has not yet been established, and no one is specifically responsible for material supply work. Because the material supply organization is unsound or has not been established at all, the provinces and cities cannot fully grasp the situation of material use in grass-roots factories and mines, and the instructions, regulations, and measures of the higher authorities cannot be transmitted to the lower levels in a timely manner. The lack of communication between the upper and lower levels has led to inconsistent understanding, inconsistent steps, blind preparation of plans, and blind review of plans. For example, in August 1952, after the North China Regional Planning Committee forwarded the notice of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on the cement allocation price in 1952 to Hebei Province, no one in Hebei Province paid attention to it until the end of November of the same year, and even the Provincial Department of Industry did not know about it. For example, when the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Basic Construction was preparing the material plan for basic construction in 1953, because it did not know that the application for basic construction materials was limited to provincial and municipal units, it subjectively included the needs of all basic construction units above the county level in the province into the plan for application.

From the inspection of the preparation of the 1953 material supply plan in various provinces and cities in the region, the North China Regional Planning Committee has put forward two important experiences for improving the material supply work in the entire region: (1) The material supply plan must be accurately compiled according to the advanced consumption quota, combined with the actual and development situation, and the leading cadres of each unit are required to fully pay attention to this work. (2) The material supply organizations at all levels must be strengthened, especially the material supply organizations at the provincial, municipal, and grass-roots levels. At present, the North China Regional Planning Committee is vigorously assisting various provinces and cities to change the chaotic situation and do a good job in material supply, so as to ensure the smooth progress of basic construction and production tasks.

### 华北区检查各地编制物资供应计划情况

    华北区检查各地编制物资供应计划情况
    华北区计划委员会，为了加强全区物资供应工作的计划性，曾于一九五二年下半年派遣工作人员分赴华北区各省市，协助各地编制一九五三年物资供应计划，同时检查了各地编制计划的情况。
    华北区计划委员会检查各地编制物资供应计划的情况时，发现各级行政部门与企业单位普遍地只重视生产计划，不重视物资供应计划。许多单位的领导干部认为生产计划确定后，物资供应计划只要少数做计划工作的人简单地计算一下，就可以编制出来。因此，一般的物资供应计划严重地脱离实际情况，大部分对于需用的物资都采取了“宁多勿少”的方针，因此计划极不准确，执行情况也很混乱。许多单位在编制一九五三年的物资供应计划时，不研究一九五二年物资使用情况，不清查一九五二年物资结存多少，也不根据一定的需用物资量的定额，就盲目地提出过高的要求。例如河北省石家庄动力厂制造压路机所需物资的定额，就是凭主观估计出来的，连厂长也不知根据是什么。石家庄农具制造厂，也任意把制造每件七寸步犁所需铁料的定额定为五十七公斤，比实际所需的二十七公斤超过一倍多。石家庄搪瓷厂计划中的用料定额，甚至完全抄袭上海搪瓷厂的用料定额作为根据。由于物资供应计划不准确，因此各单位计划不断变更的情形很多，甚至有多至三、四次以上的。这就造成了工作中的混乱状况。例如全区进行一九五三年第一季度预拨物资工作时，绥远省到订货即将终了时，还要求减退水泥八千余吨；秦皇岛市原申请水泥五千吨，结果改为二十八吨；北京市原申请煤炭五万二千四百八十六吨，后改为三万零五百七十六吨；河北省合作社原申请锅炉三十四个，后来全部撤消；天津市原申请扁钢三百二十二点四吨，结果只订了十五吨。
    从组织工作上来看，产生以上现象的原因，就是华北全区的物资供应工作机构很不健全、很不充实。例如华北区计划委员会物资分配处，不但要办理华北全区的物资分配工作，而且还要办理国外订货、仓库清理等项工作。但是，该处在一九五二年下半年开始接办业务时，工作人员只有十八名，而且多半是转业干部与刚参加工作的学生。他们对于情况不了解，对于业务不熟悉，因此，对于繁重的任务就应付不来。北京市、天津市财政经济委员会还没有设立物资分配科，管理物资供应工作的共只有七、八个人。河北、山西、绥远三省，除山西省设有一个由三人组成的物资分配小组外，河北、绥远两省的物资供应工作机构到现在还没有设立，也没有专人负责物资供应工作。由于物资供应工作机构不健全或者根本就没有设立，各省市对基层厂矿使用物资的情况不能充分掌握，上级的指示、规定、办法等也不能及时向下面传达。上下互不通气，就造成了认识不一致、步调不一致、盲目编制计划、盲目审核计划等混乱情况。例如一九五二年八月份，华北区计划委员会将政务院财政经济委员会关于一九五二年水泥调拨价格的通知转发给河北省后，直到同年十一月底，河北省还无人过问，连该省工业厅也不知道。又如河北省基本建设局在编制一九五三年基本建设用料计划时，由于不知道基本建设用料的申请只限于省市级单位的规定，主观地把全省县以上基本建设单位的需用量一并列入申请的计划中。
    华北区计划委员会，从检查全区各省市编制一九五三年物资供给计划中，已提出改进全区物资供应工作的两点重要经验：（一）物资供应计划必须精确地按照先进的消费定额，结合实际的和发展的情况来编制，而且要求各单位的领导干部充分重视这一工作。（二）必须加强各级物资供应机构，特别是省市各基层单位的物资供应机构。目前，华北区计划委员会正大力协助各省市改变混乱状况，做好物资供应工作，以便保证基本建设和生产任务的顺利进行。
