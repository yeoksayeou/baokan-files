On the Role of Soviet Trade Unions in Establishing and Consolidating the Socialist Foundation
Soviet Union, Professor I. Pantzkava

Editor's note: The activities of trade unions play a significant role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and carrying out large-scale construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, trade unions in socialist and people's democratic countries must be schools of communism. Workers and staff learn advanced theories and gain experience in managing the state and production within this organization. Trade unions must serve as a link between the Communist Party and the broadest masses of workers, educating the masses and continuously improving their political consciousness and production enthusiasm. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike, to help our cadres, especially those working in trade unions, understand the role and tasks of trade unions, we have translated Professor I. Pantzkava's "On the Role of Soviet Trade Unions in Establishing and Consolidating the Socialist Foundation" for your reference.

Stalin's historic remarks on linguistics are a prominent event in the ideological life of the Communist Party and all Soviet people. Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" is a model of creative Marxism, a model of truly scientific methods for studying the complex phenomena of social life, and a valuable contribution to Marxist-Leninist science.

Stalin's work armed the Soviet people with knowledge of the laws of social development and a clear understanding of the methods for building communism. This work is of great educational significance to the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democracies that are building socialism, to the Communist Parties of capitalist countries, and to all activists of the international workers' movement who are fighting to liberate the working class and all working people from capitalist enslavement.

In "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," Stalin gave a comprehensive definition of Marxism as a revolutionary and scientific ideology for transforming the world. "Marxism," Comrade Stalin teaches us, "is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of revolution of the oppressed and the exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of the building of a communist Society" ("Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," Liberation Press, 1950, p. 62—hereinafter, only the page number will be cited).

While establishing the Marxist theory of linguistics, Stalin creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of base and superstructure. In "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," classic definitions are given for the concepts of "base" and "superstructure," revealing their intrinsic connections and interrelationships, and explaining the characteristics of the occurrence, development, and demise of the old base and superstructure, as well as the process by which the new base and superstructure replace the old.

Comrade Stalin believes that the base is the social economic system at a certain stage of social development. That is to say, there is no "general base" just as there is no "general society," but only a certain base at a certain historical period, which is the sum of the relations of production that occupy a dominant position under a certain social economic formation.

The characteristic of the base is that it serves society economically. Therefore, when identifying social economic systems, Marxists base their judgment on who controls the means of production, whether the means of production are controlled by the entire society or by individuals, individual groups, or individual classes who use them to exploit others, other groups, or other classes. The ownership of the means of production is the foundation of social relations of production.

Capitalist society, like all other societies, has its own base. The foundation of this base is the capitalist private ownership of the means of production. Based on this, capitalism inherently involves the exploitation of people by people and the oppression of the majority by the minority.

The socialist foundation has a completely new essence. The foundation of this base is the social public ownership of the means of production. Based on this, the cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships of staff members who are free from exploitation are primary here.

When defining the superstructure, Comrade Stalin taught us that the superstructure includes society's views on politics, law, religion, art, philosophy, and the political, legal, and other systems appropriate to these views. The superstructure, like the base, is a product of a certain era. It arises with the emergence of the base. When the base changes and is eliminated, then its superstructure will also change and be eliminated accordingly. Replacing the old base and its superstructure is a new base and a new superstructure suitable for it.

The ideas and systems included in the superstructure are produced by the base, and these ideas and systems in turn affect the base, serving as an active force for the formation and consolidation of the base.

Stalin's new exposition of the ideas of base and superstructure clarifies the role of the superstructure in our social development. This idea also profoundly elaborates on the role of trade union organizations, as an integral part of the superstructure, in establishing and consolidating the socialist foundation.

The emergence of the socialist foundation and the socialist superstructure has its particularity compared with the emergence of all previous foundations and their superstructures. This particularity is caused by the emergence of a new social form due to the proletarian revolution, which is opposed to all previous social forms in its content and form.

When talking about the characteristics of the proletarian revolution that distinguish it from the bourgeois revolution, Stalin pointed out that the bourgeois revolution usually begins when the more readily available forms of the capitalist economy are already in place, and these forms have already grown and matured within feudal society before the open revolution occurs; while the proletarian revolution begins when the readily available forms of the socialist economy are not yet available, or are almost not yet available.

Only after the proletariat is in power can the work of eliminating the capitalist economic base and establishing a new—socialist base—begin.

"In the past thirty years," Comrade Stalin wrote, "the old capitalist foundation has been eliminated in Russia, and a new socialist foundation has been built. At the same time, the superstructure on the capitalist foundation has been eliminated, and a new superstructure suitable for the socialist foundation has been built" (p. 2).

The socialist revolution lays the foundation for a new state—the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a new type of state that is different in principle from any previous state. This state arises on the ruins of the old, bourgeois state and is a weapon of the proletarian revolution and the most important support point of the proletarian revolution.

The task of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie after its regime has been overthrown and to carry the revolution to the end, to the complete victory of socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is fundamentally different from the dictatorship of the exploiting classes not only in terms of its class essence but also in terms of its internal structure. As Lenin pointed out, it is a "new type of democratic state" for the majority of working people, a "new type of dictatorial state" against the bourgeoisie. In its practical activities, the dictatorship of the proletariat inevitably combines persuasion with coercion. This characteristic of the dictatorship of the proletariat determines its structure and its "machine." State power must guarantee coercion; it is fundamentally inconceivable to implement a dictatorship without coercion. However, the great tasks facing the dictatorship of the working class and the proletarian revolution—suppressing the overthrown bourgeoisie, transforming the masses, and building socialism—require the Soviet state to maintain constant and close contact with the broad masses of working people.

Therefore, in addition to the organs of violence and coercion, the dictatorship of the proletariat must have "belts" and "levers" through which it can realize its influence on and connection with the masses. In addition, the dictatorship of the proletariat must have a "guiding force" capable of leading, coordinating, and directing the activities of these "belts" and "levers."

"Levers or belts," Stalin pointed out, "are the mass organizations of the proletariat; without the use of these organizations, it is impossible to realize the dictatorship."

"The guiding force is the advanced unit of the proletariat, the vanguard of the proletariat, which is the basic leading force of the dictatorship of the proletariat" ("Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 177).

The mass organizations of the working people, which are included in the proletarian system as "belts" or "levers," are trade unions, Soviets, cooperatives, and the Youth League. The Communist Party unites their activities and guides their activities. The Party is the basic leading force in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the highest form of class unity of the proletariat.

All these organizations played a huge role in eliminating the old, capitalist foundation and establishing a new, socialist foundation.

In his work "Once Again on Trade Unions," Lenin pointed out that trade unions as a social phenomenon have many characteristics that explain them from all aspects. But differing from dialectics and eclecticism, Lenin emphasized that dialectics require distinguishing the main aspects of the phenomenon's development under certain historical conditions. Lenin taught us that trade unions "are schools, schools of unity, schools of mutual interest, schools for protecting their own interests, schools for managing the economy, schools for administration." He continued, "Trade unions are the reserve army of state power, schools of communism, schools for managing the economy" ("Lenin on Trade Unions," Workers' Publishing House edition, pp. 160, 163). Therefore, the main characteristic of trade unions "is not management, but 'connection'" (Lenin), that is, the connection between state management, the national economy, and the broad masses of working people, which is realized under the direct leadership of the Communist Party.

While pointing out that this connection must be built on the basis of persuasion, Lenin wrote: "Trade unions can establish the connection between the vanguard and the masses. Trade unions use daily work to persuade the masses, to persuade the masses of the class that is uniquely able to lead us from capitalism to socialism" ("Lenin on Trade Unions," Workers' Publishing House edition, p. 53).

Soviet trade unions are an integral part of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and they mainly perform a certain inherent function in this system, which is the function of connecting the Party and the class, "primarily in production" (Stalin). This is the difference between trade unions and other "belts" and "levers" in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat. When analyzing the characteristics of trade unions, Stalin wrote:

"They unite all the workers in all trades. This is not a Party organization. Trade unions can be called organizations that include all members of our ruling class, that is, the working class. They are schools of communism. They select outstanding members from their ranks to take on leadership positions in all management departments. They connect the advanced elements with the backward elements of the working class. They connect the masses of workers with the vanguard of the working class" ("Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 177).

The characteristics of Lenin's and Stalin's analysis of the superstructure are also very suitable for trade unions. The new superstructure began to form during the revolutionary turmoil. "...It is precisely during this period," Lenin wrote, "that many contradictions that have slowly accumulated during the so-called peaceful development period can be resolved. It is precisely during this period that the direct role of various classes in determining the forms of social life will be manifested with great force, and the foundation of the political 'superstructure' will be established, after which this superstructure will be maintained for a long time on the basis of new production relations" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 13, p. 22).

Trade unions, like the Soviets, were first created in Russia under the leadership of the Communist Party in the revolutionary struggle of the working class against the Tsarist autocracy and the system of landlords and capitalists. The initial sprouts of trade unions appeared in the flames of the 1905 Revolution, and the current large-scale trade unions were formed during the period from February to October 1917. They became an important force in the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and after the victory of the socialist revolution, they became the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Stalin teaches us that the superstructure is produced by the base. But it is not only a reflection of the base, merely passive, neutral, indifferent to the fate of its base, the fate of the class, or the nature of the system. "On the contrary, once the superstructure appears, it will become a great active force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its base..." (p. 3).

In addition to other mass organizations of the working class, trade unions have also played the role of this active force in the entire history of the Soviet state. With their activities, they have helped the Communist Party and the Soviet state in establishing the socialist foundation and building a socialist society. Trade unions were, and still are, active participants in our country's communist construction.

Before the Great October Socialist Revolution, under the capitalist system in Russia, trade unions, under the leadership of the Communist Party, led the economic struggle of the working class and actively participated in the political struggle of the working class, bringing heavy blows to the capitalist foundation and its superstructure, that is, the bourgeois state. "Before this, they were organs that resisted oppressed labor and resisted capitalism" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 429).

After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the position and tasks of trade unions fundamentally changed. Lenin and Stalin determined that the role of trade unions in the new historical conditions, under the Soviet state, is that of a school of management, a school of operation, and a school of communism.

In his report to the Second All-Russian Trade Union Congress, Lenin pointed out: "At this very moment, on a class scale, trade unions are the broadest organizations of the proletariat. In fact, it is precisely now, especially after the great political change in which power has fallen into the hands of the proletariat, that trade unions should play a particularly important role, should occupy the most central position politically, and should become truly the main political organs..." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 396).

Lenin called the period from November 1917 to February 1918 the period of "Red Guard attacks on capital." The Soviet regime destroyed the economic power of the bourgeoisie, occupied the dominant position in the national economy, and destroyed the state power organs of the bourgeoisie. In the spring of 1918, the transition to a new stage began, that is, the transition to organizationally consolidating the victories already won and establishing the economic foundation of socialism.

The political superstructure of the new society "helps the new system by every means to conclude and eliminate the old foundation and the old classes" (Stalin). In solving this task, the Communist Party and the young Soviet state occupy a leading position. Soviet trade unions also actively participated in this cause.

What functions did trade unions perform during this period?

The Great October Socialist Revolution deprived the bourgeoisie of the means of production and transformed them into the property of the people and the property of society. On this basis, new, socialist relations of production arose.

With the active participation of trade unions, the Soviet state transitioned from worker supervision of production, which was implemented after the February Revolution in 1917 and in the initial period after the October Revolution, to the nationalization of industry. During this period, trade unions, under the leadership of the Party, helped the Soviet system eliminate the old foundation. They completed the most complex tasks of organizing industrial management, and they took on the responsibility of caring for increasing labor productivity and establishing new socialist production discipline. Responding to the "great initiative" of communist voluntary Saturdays organized by workers, trade unions educated the masses to treat labor with a socialist attitude and helped establish new, socialist relations of production.

In the struggle against foreign armed interventionists and self-defense forces armed by the predatory American and British imperialists, trade unions provided great help to the Party and the Soviet state. Trade unions actively participated in the establishment of the Red Army, organized grain teams to supply grain to the front and the rear, and established medical teams for the wounded and sick soldiers of the Red Army.

Lenin gave a high evaluation of the activities of trade unions in these years. "If we do not form extremely close ties with the trade unions, if we do not have the enthusiastic support of the trade unions, if we do not have the selfless work of the trade unions not only in economic construction but also in military construction, then we will not be able to manage the country and realize the dictatorship for even two months, let alone two years." (Lenin's Selected Works, two-volume Chinese edition, Vol. 2, p. 714)

Throughout the entire history of the post-October Revolution period, Soviet trade unions have played an important role in establishing and consolidating the socialist foundation and in consolidating the Soviet state, which organizes and guides the planned development of the Soviet economy and is the main weapon of our country's communist construction.

Trade unions were, and still are, active promoters of the Party's policies among the working masses. The Charter of Soviet Trade Unions states: Trade unions unite the working masses around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and strive to fully consolidate the socialist society and the state system. Trade unions constantly assist the various measures implemented by the Soviet state, because this state protects the rights of working people and represents the interests of the people in its laws.

Soviet trade unions are mass social organizations that unite workers and staff of various occupations on a voluntary basis and occupy a prominent position in socialist society.

The Stalin Constitution stipulates a broad field of activity for trade unions in domestic political, economic, and cultural life. The actual work of Soviet trade unions is determined by the specific tasks put forward by the Communist Party to the Soviet people.

× × ×

Trade unions are very concerned about enhancing the economic strength of the Soviet state, because this is the basis for continuously improving the material welfare and culture of the working masses and the guarantee for successfully completing the great plan of communist construction.

The help of trade unions in consolidating the socialist economic base is first and foremost the organization and leadership of socialist competition. Socialist competition, by its nature, is inherent in the socialist mode of production, and it is possible only under the socialist base. Competition is our country's communist method of construction and an active force in developing the socialist mode of production. Socialist competition has a great impact on those engaged in production activities, on the cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships between people in the production process, and on the development and consolidation of socialist relations of production.

In order to implement the historic call of the 16th Party Congress to launch socialist competition, trade unions in the previous five-year plan periods mobilized the creative initiative of the masses to complete the Lenin-Stalin plan for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization and to participate in our country's socialist construction.

During the years of the Great Patriotic War, trade unions carried out intensive organizational and educational work among the masses. Trade unions supported the initiative of the people in launching the All-Soviet Socialist Competition, and they made a considerable contribution to defeating the enemy.

After the victorious conclusion of the Great Patriotic War, trade unions, according to the call of the Lenin-Stalin Party, led the socialist competition to strive to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

In recent years, socialist competition has been in a new upsurge. It has a national character and has been enriched with various new forms. Now, the participants in the competition not only pay attention to the quantitative indicators of production but also pay attention to the quality indicators of production.

The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on leading socialist competition have opened up broad prospects for further developing competition in industry, transportation, agriculture, and construction projects.

Due to the qualitative changes that have taken place in the national economy in recent years, new All-Soviet Socialist Competition conditions were adopted in 1951. According to the new conditions, the main signs of the winners of socialist competition are: each workshop and each enterprise completes the national plan in accordance with the stipulated product item table and product categories; vigorously improves product quality and reduces costs; saves raw materials and materials; correctly uses the internal potential of industry and agriculture; promotes new technologies; and further improves labor productivity and production culture.

The issue of socialist competition occupies an important position in the work of trade union organizations. Trade unions follow the instructions of the Party and the resolutions of the 10th Trade Union Congress, support and develop the initiative of production innovators, assist in the large-scale promotion of advanced labor methods, help competitors formulate socialist competition conditions, summarize the competition, organize Stakhanov schools, organize lectures and discussions by production advanced workers, and publicize the experience of Stakhanov-style workers through factory publications, posters, broadcasting, and other means, and publish books about Stakhanov-style workers.

The socialist competition organized by trade unions under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party is a powerful driving force for the Soviet society's development towards communism.

Competition is of extremely great significance for the consolidation of the socialist economy. On the basis of socialist competition, the national economic plan is successfully completed, and all sectors of industry, transportation, and agriculture are rapidly developing. The summary of 1951 convincingly proves this point. In 1951, the total industrial output plan was completed by 103.5%; the total industrial output increased by 16% compared with 1950, and labor productivity increased by 10% in one year. The 1951 plan tasks for the Stalin construction projects on the Volga River, the Don River, the Dnieper River, and the Amu Darya River were successfully completed. In 1951, the country's machine manufacturing industry created nearly 500 new brands and new types of machines and machinery. In one year, nearly 700,000 inventions and rationalization proposals aimed at improving or fundamentally improving the production process proposed by workers and engineering and technical personnel were adopted. In 1951, more than 26 billion rubles were saved due to the reduction of industrial product costs.

In this way, Soviet trade unions, through organizing socialist competition, have a positive impact on socialist production, mobilizing the masses to increase labor productivity, improve labor organization, and improve production processes, technology, and labor tools, thereby accelerating the development of socialist production. This impact on the development of Soviet social productive forces does not occur directly but through the impact of competition on socialist relations of production.

Communism means a high degree of labor productivity, which is necessary to create abundant consumer goods. Only with abundant consumer goods can we transition from socialism to communism. "Communism," Lenin wrote, "is a higher labor productivity than capitalism, created by those voluntary, conscious, and united workers who use advanced technology" (Lenin's Selected Works, Vol. 2, p. 597).

The increase in labor productivity first requires the guarantee of the material foundation of large-scale industry. But without the increase in education and culture of the masses, without the improvement of labor discipline and better labor organization, the increase in labor productivity is also inconceivable.

Any social system must have its own unique labor discipline. But in contrast to the capitalist labor discipline of hunger and coercion, the socialist organization of social labor is based on a conscious attitude towards labor, based on the extensive development of the initiative and creative enthusiasm of the working masses who work not for the exploiters but for themselves, for their own society, and whose production results are closely related to them.

The conscious nature of Soviet social labor discipline is determined by the nature of socialist relations of production, which are based on the world's most advanced socialist economic system.

However, everyone knows that consciousness always lags behind existence. Socialism has been built in our country, and we are transitioning from socialism to communism at a rapid pace. But in the consciousness of some Soviet people, there are still capitalist remnants that hinder the forward development of Soviet society. These remnants are particularly manifested in things such as disrupting labor discipline, neglecting national interests and production interests, and non-socialist attitudes towards labor and public property. From this, it can be seen that the superstructure has an extremely great role in cultivating a communist attitude towards labor and conscious labor discipline.

At the 16th Party Congress, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the problem of increasing labor productivity should be solved from three aspects: improving the material conditions of the working masses, cultivating comradely labor discipline, and organizing socialist competition.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, trade unions are carrying out a huge task of cultivating comradely labor discipline. Lenin wrote: Trade unions cultivate labor discipline through their education, influence, propaganda, and deep concern for production and discipline. Due to its mass nature and its direct and close ties with the working masses, trade unions have full possibilities in this work. Trade unions have a large network of cultural institutions—clubs, cultural palaces, red corners, libraries, film equipment, and so on. They conduct all aspects of mass education work. The army of more than 11 million trade union activists is a huge force. Trade union activists influence backward workers through their exemplary actions, organizational work, and explanatory work among the masses. Strict compliance with state discipline and labor discipline is one of the main requirements of the trade union charter for every trade union member.

Conscious labor discipline is cultivated in the process of socialist competition, due to the development of the creative initiative and spontaneity of the working masses, due to constant explanatory work among millions of competitors, and with the help of the persuasion method, which is the basic method of trade union work.

The signing of collective contracts, the fulfillment by the administrative side and trade union organizations of the obligations they have undertaken in the collective contracts, and the implementation of the socialist principle of labor remuneration (trade unions should supervise its implementation) are of great significance for the solution of the above problems.

The cultivation of conscious discipline is closely linked to the education of the masses to treat social wealth with a caring attitude and a socialist attitude. Caring for and consolidating socialist public property—the sacred and inviolable foundation of the Soviet system, the source of the prosperity and strength of the motherland, and the source of the rich and cultural life of all working people—is an important obligation of every worker, staff member, and every trade union member stipulated in the trade union charter. The work carried out by trade union organizations in this regard is of great significance for the development of socialist production and the consolidation of the socialist economic base.

In this way, a communist attitude towards labor and public property is cultivated among the broad masses of workers and staff with the active participation of trade unions, and the comradely cooperation and mutual assistance between workers freed from exploitation, which is a characteristic of the socialist system, is constantly developed. The consolidation of socialist relations of production has a positive impact on the development of productive forces in Soviet society. × × ×

Trade union management of state social insurance is one of the specific forms in which the superstructure, as part of the socialist base, serves.

The issue of social insurance cannot be resolved "in general." It is necessary to strictly distinguish between social insurance in Tsarist Russia and capitalist countries and social insurance in the Soviet Union and people's democracies.

Social insurance in capitalist society is part of the "factory law" implemented by the bourgeois government. Comrade Stalin teaches us that "factory law" can only arise when the workers' movement transitions from a primary stage to a higher stage, becomes a mass and organized movement, and only when the previously scattered forces of the proletariat move towards unity and form a unified class.

The situation in Tsarist Russia was also the same. When the workers' movement did not yet have a mass and organized nature, the Tsarist government had only one means of dealing with the workers' movement, and that was prison, Siberia, whipping, and the gallows. But when the organized masses of the proletariat participated in the class struggle, the reactionaries had to adopt new "more civilized" means—"factory law"—in addition to the old means to oppose the workers' movement. By making certain concessions to the workers, the reactionaries hoped to divide the unity of the proletariat, win the trust of backward workers, and then make them give up the struggle.

From this, it can be concluded that all "factory laws" in capitalist countries, including social insurance laws, are concessions forced by the bourgeois government due to the increasing struggle of the proletariat for the right to life.

"No cause, no struggle," Comrade Stalin wrote, "no 'factory law' will appear. When workers have not yet struggled, when the government does not need to meet the demands of workers, the government will not promulgate any 'factory law'." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 1, p. 291)

The social insurance laws of capitalist countries must also be understood from this perspective. The 1912 draft insurance law and the later social insurance law of Tsarist Russia were a direct result of the new revolutionary upsurge of the working class in 1911-1912. However, this bill was far from meeting the requirements of the Lenin insurance program put forward by the Bolshevik Party's representative Jin Laga at the conference. This bill was an extremely limited concession forced by the Tsarist government under the pressure of the workers' movement.

Obviously, the capitalist base, due to its own contradictions, requires the bourgeois government, that is, its superstructure, to carry out certain reforms under certain conditions. These reforms are formally concessions to the working class, but in essence, they are to protect this base.

If this reform is forced by the Tsarist government and has the purpose of dividing the workers' movement to maintain the rule of the bourgeoisie, then for the working class, the struggle for social insurance is not only a struggle to protect the working class from "physical and mental degradation" (Lenin's words) but also a school for educating the working class, a school for organizing the working class to fight for complete liberation. This is because, as Lenin pointed out: "Completely overthrowing the Tsarist system and striving for the conditions of the working class's free class struggle are necessary conditions for implementing an insurance reform that truly conforms to the interests of the proletariat." (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 1, pp. 291-292) Comrade Stalin emphasized: Any "factory law," "no matter how bad the bill is, but there are always a few articles in it that can be used by the proletariat to strengthen its struggle." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 1, pp. 291-292)

Therefore, the "factory law" in capitalist countries, including the social insurance law, is fundamentally hostile to the proletariat. Marx wrote: From the beginning, the legislation on wage labor was to exploit the working class, and in its continued development, it is undoubtedly always hostile to the working class. However, the struggle for social insurance is part of the working class's overall class struggle. If the proletarian party does not allow bourgeois ideologists to introduce this struggle into pure reformism and does not allow it to be isolated from the political struggle, then this struggle makes an extremely important contribution to the working class's cause of fighting for its own liberation.

From this, it can be concluded that the insurance law under the capitalist system, like the general "factory law," cannot even be regarded as a budding form of the socialist superstructure. Because under the capitalist system, there is neither a socialist law of which it must become a part, nor a socialist base that it should serve. The "factory law" of bourgeois society is part of the legal superstructure of the capitalist base, because it protects the capitalist base by deceiving the working class and dividing the workers' movement.

At the same time, the insurance law, as part of the capitalist superstructure, has its characteristics. First of all, it must be pointed out that the insurance law is produced when the foundation of capitalism has already been shaken. Therefore, it is forced to fight more to protect the capitalist base than to consolidate the capitalist base. First, the insurance law, which is directly related to the proletarian struggle, can only perform extremely limited functions under capitalist conditions. Secondly, the passage of the social insurance law objectively promotes the strengthening of the proletariat's struggle against the capitalist base.

Implementing a comprehensive social insurance program that truly conforms to the interests of the workers is only possible after the working class has won victory and seized power. In the Soviet Union, Lenin's insurance program has been thoroughly implemented. Soviet social insurance is one of the most important achievements of the working class due to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Everyone knows that in the Soviet Union, all expenses of social insurance are borne by the state. All the practical work of state social insurance is carried out by trade unions—the most mass organization of our workers and staff. Social insurance funds are composed of insurance premiums that enterprises and institutions must pay. This means that the increase in the social insurance budget completely depends on the increase in the state's socialist wealth.

The Soviet state social insurance is a product of the socialist base and the product of socialist relations of production. Social insurance is an important weapon for developing and further consolidating the socialist base. Social insurance can promote the cultivation of a socialist work attitude of workers and staff and the improvement of the life, material conditions, and cultural conditions of the working masses. All this gives us full reason to believe that the Soviet state social insurance is one of the functions of the socialist superstructure. × × ×

The trade unions of the Soviet state are an important component of the political superstructure of the socialist base. The Soviet trade unions are powerful because they work, develop, and consolidate under the leadership of the Communist Party—the organizer and inspirer of all victories of the Soviet people in the struggle for communism. Trade unions play the role of a unified school, a school of unity, a school of management, attraction, and education, and a school of communism. Trade unions are educational organizations, and workers and staff learn how to manage the state and manage production in this organization.

Trade unions connect the Communist Party with the broadest masses of workers. Trade unions are not state organizations or coercive organizations. They primarily influence the masses with the power of persuasion, explanation, and extensive propaganda, developing the political and creative initiative and spontaneity of the working masses.

Trade unions, with their various activities carried out under the guidance of the Bolshevik Party and in close connection with other "belts" and "levers" in the system of the dictatorship of the working class, help consolidate the socialist base and its superstructure—the Soviet state.

Comrade Stalin's brilliant work on linguistics has enriched Marxist-Leninist theory with new conclusions and principles, which are of great significance not only for the development of all sciences but also for the entire cause of communist construction.

Comrade Stalin's instructions on the role of the superstructure in social development make us more deeply understand the great significance of Soviet ideology and all Soviet organs and organizations, including trade unions, for consolidating the socialist economic system, continuing to enhance the economic and political strength of the socialist state, improving the living standards and culture of the Soviet people, and accelerating the speed of the Soviet society's transition to communism.

    编者按：工会的活动对于巩固人民民主专政和进行大规模建设具有重大的作用。社会主义和人民民主各国的工会，在共产党的领导下，必须是共产主义的学校。工人和职员在这个组织中学习着先进的理论，学习着管理国家和管理生产的经验。工会必须成为共产党和最广大的劳动群众联系的纽带，通过它来教育劳动群众，不断提高他们的政治觉悟和生产积极性。在“二七”三十周年纪念的今天，为了帮助我们的干部特别是工会工作干部了解工会的作用和任务，我们将苏联依·潘茨哈娃教授“论苏联工会在建立与巩固社会主义基础中的作用”一文译载在这里，以供大家参考。
    斯大林关于语言学问题的历史性的发言，在共产党和全体苏维埃人民的思想生活中是一个突出的事件。斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一天才的著作，是创造性的马克思主义的典范，真正以科学方法研究社会生活复杂现象的典范，并且是马克思——列宁主义科学中的宝贵的贡献。
    斯大林的著作以社会发展法则的知识，以建设共产主义方法的清晰理解武装了苏联人民。这个著作对正在建设社会主义的各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党，对各资本主义国家的共产党，对为争取从资本主义的奴役下解放工人阶级和全体劳动人民而斗争的全体国际工人运动的活动家来讲，是有着巨大的教育意义。
    斯大林在“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一著作中，对作为改造世界底革命的、科学的马克思主义下了全面的定义。“马克思主义——斯大林同志教导我们说——是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学”（“马克思主义与语言学问题”，解放社一九五○年版第六十二页——以下同书只引页数）。
    ×××
    建立了马克思主义的语言学说的同时，斯大林创造性地发展了马克思—列宁主义的基础与上层建筑的理论。在“马克思主义与语言学问题”一书中，对“基础”与“上层建筑”的概念下了经典的定义，揭发了它们内在的联系与相互关系，精辟地说明了旧的基础与上层建筑发生、发展和消灭过程以及新的基础与上层建筑代替旧的过程的特点。
    斯大林同志认为，基础是社会发展到某一阶段上的社会经济制度。这就是说，没有“一般基础”像没有“一般社会”一样，而只能有一定历史时期的某种基础，这种基础就是在某种社会经济形态条件下占统治地位的生产关系的总合。
    基础的特点就是它在经济上为社会服务。因此在鉴别社会经济制度时，马克思主义者是根据：谁掌握生产资料，生产资料是由整个社会来支配还是由利用它来剥削别人、别的集团、别的阶级的个别人、个别集团、个别阶级来支配。生产资料的所有制是社会生产关系的基础。
    资本主义社会像其他一切社会一样，具有其自己的基础。这个基础的基础就是生产资料的资本主义私有制。据此，资本主义就固有人剥削人和多数受少数压迫这样一种关系。
    社会主义社会的基础具有崭新的本质。这个基础的基础是生产资料的社会公有制。据此，在这里是摆脱了剥削的工作人员底合作与互助关系是主要的。
    斯大林同志在为上层建筑下定义的时候教导我们说：上层建筑中包括社会对于政治、法律、宗教、艺术、哲学的观点，以及适合于这些观点的政治、法律等制度。上层建筑正如基础一样是某一个时代的产物。它是随着基础的产生而产生。当基础发生变化和被消灭时，那末它的上层建筑也就会随着变化，随着被消灭。代替旧的基础及其上层建筑随之而来的是新的基础以及适合于它的新的上层建筑。
    包括在上层建筑中的思想与制度是由基础产生的，这种思想与制度反过来又影响基础，它是为形成与巩固基础而服务的积极力量。
    斯大林对基础与上层建筑思想的新发挥阐明了上层建筑在我们社会发展中的作用。在这个思想中也深刻地阐发了作为上层建筑不可分割的一部分的工会组织，在建立与巩固社会主义基础中的作用。
    社会主义的基础和社会主义的上层建筑的产生，较以前所有的基础及其上层建筑的产生是有其特殊性。这个特殊性是由于无产阶级革命而出现了新的社会形态所引起，这种社会形态依其内容与形式是与以前的一切社会形态相对立。
    在谈到无产阶级革命区别于资产阶级革命的特点时，斯大林指出，资产阶级革命通常是在资本主义经济较为现成的形式已经具备时开始发生的，这种形式还在公开革命发生以前，就已在封建社会内部生长和成熟了；而无产阶级革命却是在社会主义经济底现成形式尚未具备，或几乎尚未具备时开始发生的。
    只有在无产阶级执政以后，才能开始消灭资本主义经济基础和建立新的——社会主义基础的工作。
    “在最近三十年中，——斯大林同志写道——在俄国消灭了旧的资本主义基础，建设了新的社会主义基础。同时，也就消灭了资本主义基础上的上层建筑，并建设了适合于社会主义基础的新的上层建筑”（第二页）。
    社会主义革命在为新的国家——无产阶级专政的国家，在原则上区别于以前任何国家的新型的国家奠定基础。这个国家是在旧的、资产阶级国家的废墟上产生的，并且是无产阶级革命的武器，是无产阶级革命最重要的支撑点。
    无产阶级专政的任务，就是镇压资产阶级在政权被推翻以后之反抗，把革命进行到底，进行到社会主义的彻底胜利。
    无产阶级专政不仅按自己的阶级本质，而且按其内部的机构也根本不同于剥削阶级的专政。正如列宁所指出的是大多数劳动人民底“新式民主的国家”，是反对资产阶级的“新式专政的国家”，无产阶级专政在其实际活动中不可避免地要把说服与强制相结合起来。无产阶级专政的这一特点就决定了它的机构和它的“机器”。国家政权要保证强迫，没有强迫要实行专政那是根本不可想像的。但是执行摆在工人阶级专政和无产阶级革命面前的巨大任务——镇压被推翻的资产阶级，改造群众，建设社会主义——要求苏维埃国家和广大的劳动群众要保持经常的紧密的联系。
    因而，无产阶级专政除暴力与强制的机关以外，必须有“引带”和“杠杆”，无产阶级专政借助于它们才能实现其对群众的影响和与群众的联系。此外，无产阶级专政必须有能够领导、配合、指导这种“引带”和“杠杆”活动的“指导力量”。
    “杠杆或引带——斯大林指出——就是无产阶级底群众组织，不运用这些组织，便无法实现专政”。
    “指导力量就是无产阶级底先进部队，就是无产阶级底先锋队，它是无产阶级专政底基本领导力量”（“列宁主义问题”中文版第一百七十七页）。
    作为“引带”或“杠杆”而包括在无产阶级体系中的劳动人民的群众组织，就是工会、苏维埃、合作社和青年团。共产党把它们的活动联合起来，并指导它们的活动，党是无产阶级专政体系中的基本领导力量，是无产阶级阶级联合底最高形式。
    所有这些组织在消灭旧的、资本主义的基础和建立新的、社会主义基础中起了巨大的作用。
    列宁在“再论职工会”这一著作中指出：作为社会现象的工会具有很多从各方面来说明它的特点。但是辩证法和折衷主义不同，列宁着重指出，辩证法要求要分出现象发展到某一历史条件下的主要方面。列宁教导我们说：工会“是学校，是团结的学校，是利害一致的学校，是保护他们本身利益的学校，是领导经济的学校，是管理的学校”。并继续指出：“工会是国家权力之后备军，是共产主义底学校，是领导经济的学校”（“列宁论职工会”工人出版社版，第一六○、一六三页）。因而，工会的主要特点“不是管理，而是‘联系’”（列宁），就是国家管理，国民经济和广大劳动群众的联系，这种联系是在共产党直接领导下实现的。
    在指出这个联系必须建筑在说服的基础之上的同时，列宁写道：“工会能建立起先锋队与群众之间的联系，工会用日常的工作说服群众，说服那唯一能够领我们从资本主义过渡到社会主义去的阶级之群众”（“列宁论职工会”工人出版社版、第五十三页）。
    苏联工会是无产阶级专政体系的组成部分，它在这个体系中主要是执行着一定的它所固有的职能，这就是党和阶级联系的职能，“首先是在生产方面”
    （斯大林）。这就是工会和无产阶级专政体系中的其他“引带”，“杠杆”的不同。斯大林在分析工会的特点时写道：
    “它们把所有各业工人都联合起来。这不是党组织。职工会可以称为包括我国统治阶级，即工人阶级全体组成员的组织。它们是共产主义的学校。它们从自己队伍中提出优秀分子来担任一切管理部门方面的领导工作。它们把工人阶级中的先进分子与落后分子联系起来。它们把工人群众与工人阶级先锋队连结起来”（“列宁主义问题”中文版第一百七十七页）。
    列宁和斯大林对上层建筑分析的特点，对工会来讲也非常适合。新的上层建筑是在革命动荡时期开始形成的。“……正是在这个时期——列宁写道——那些在所谓和平发展时期慢慢积累起来的许多矛盾才能解决。正是在这个时期才会以巨大的力量表现出各阶级在决定社会生活形式中的直接作用，才会建立起政治‘上层建筑’的基础，而后这一上层建筑在新的生产关系的基础上维持很久”（列宁全集第十三卷第二十二页）。
    工会像苏维埃一样，是在工人阶级反对沙皇专制和地主资本家制度的革命战斗过程中在共产党的领导下第一次在俄国产生。工会最初的萌芽是在一九○五年革命的烽火中出现的，而现在的这些大批工会是从一九一七年二月到十月这个时期形成的，它们在争取无产阶级专政中成了重要的力量，而在社会主义革命胜利以后则成了无产阶级专政的支柱。
    斯大林教导我们说，上层建筑是由基础产生的。但它不仅是反映基础，只是消极的、中立的，对自己基础的命运、对阶级的命运、对制度的性质漠不关心的。“相反地，上层建筑一出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固……”（第三页）。
    除了其他工人阶级的群众团体外，工会在苏维埃国家的全部历史中也起了这种积极力量的作用。它们在建立社会主义的基础和建设社会主义社会中以自己的活动帮助了共产党和苏维埃国家。工会过去是，现在仍然是我国共产主义建设的积极参加者。
    伟大十月社会主义革命以前，在俄国资本主义制度条件下，在共产党的领导下，工会领导了工人阶级的经济斗争，并积极地参加了工人阶级的政治斗争，给资本主义基础及其上层建筑，亦即资产阶级的国家带来了沉重的打击。“在这以前它们是反抗压迫劳动的人的机关，是反抗资本主义的机关”（列宁全集第三十卷第四百二十九页）。
    伟大十月社会主义革命以后，工会的地位和任务根本地改变了。列宁和斯大林确定了在新的历史条件下、在苏维埃国家的条件下，工会的作用就是管理的学校，经营的学校，共产主义的学校。
    在全俄工会第二次代表大会的报告中，列宁指出：“正当此时，以阶级规模来讲，工会是无产阶级最广泛的组织，事实上，正是现在，特别是在政权落到无产阶级手中这一政治大变革之后，工会就应该起特别重大的作用，应该在政治上占居最中心的地位，应成为名符其实的主要的政治机关……”
    （列宁全集第二十八卷第三百九十六页）。
    从一九一七年十一月至一九一八年二月这一时期，列宁把它称之为“向资本实行赤卫队式攻击”的时期，苏维埃政权摧毁了资产阶级的经济力量，占了国民经济的统治地位，并摧毁了资产阶级的国家政权机关。一九一八年春开始过渡到新的阶段，就是过渡到在组织上来巩固已获得的胜利和建立社会主义的经济基础。
    新社会的政治上层建筑采取“一切办法帮助新的制度来终结和消灭旧的基础和旧的阶级”（斯大林）。在解决这个任务中，共产党和年轻的苏维埃国家占主要地位。苏联工会也积极地参加了这一事业。
    工会在这个时期执行了什么职能？
    伟大十月社会主义革命剥夺了资产阶级的生产资料，并将其变成了人民的财产和社会的财产。在这一基础上产生了新的、社会主义的生产关系。
    苏维埃国家在工会的积极参加下，从一九一七年二月革命以后以及十月革命以后初期所实行的工人监督生产过渡到了工业国有化。工会在这个时期在党的领导下，帮助了苏维埃制度消灭旧的基础。它们完成了组织工业管理的最复杂的任务，它们负起了关心提高劳动生产率和建立新的社会主义的生产纪律的责任。响应了工人组织共产主义义务星期六的“伟大创举”以后，工会教育了群众要以社会主义的态度对待劳动，并帮助建立新的、社会主义的生产关系。
    在与外国武装干涉者以及强盗的美、英帝国主义所装备起来的自卫分子的斗争中，工会给党和苏维埃国家以很大的帮助。工会积极地参加了红军的建立，组织了供给前线和后方粮食的粮食队，为红军的伤病员建立了军医队。
    工会在这些年代中的活动获得了列宁的崇高的评价。“如果不与工会结成极亲密的联系，如果没有工会底热烈拥护，如果没有工会不仅在经济建设上，而且在军事建设上奋不顾身的工作，那么我们不要说两年，便是两个月也不能管理国家和实现专政。”（列宁文选两卷集中文版第二集七百一十四页）
    在十月革命以后时期的全部历史中，苏联工会在建立与巩固社会主义基础以及在巩固苏维埃国家中起了重要的作用，这个国家组织和指导苏维埃经济有计划地发展并且是我国共产主义建设的主要武器。
    工会在劳动群众中过去是，现在仍是党的政策底积极的推行者。在苏联工会章程中指出：工会把工人群众团结在列宁、斯大林党的周围，为全力巩固社会主义社会和国家制度而奋斗。工会对苏维埃国家所实行的各种措施经常给与协助，因为这个国家是保卫劳动人民的权利，在其法令中代表人民的利益。
    苏联工会是群众性的社会团体，在自愿的原则上联合着各种职业的职工，在社会主义社会中占有显著的地位。
    斯大林宪法为工会规定了在国内政治、经济和文
    化生活中广阔的活动地盘。苏联工会的实际工作是
    由共产党向苏联人民所提出的具体任务而决定。
    ×××
    工会非常关心苏维埃国家经济实力的增强，因为
    这是不断提高劳动群众的物质福利和文化的基础，
    是胜利完成共产主义建设伟大计划的保证。
    工会对于巩固社会主义经济基础的帮助，首先就
    是组织和领导社会主义竞赛的工作。社会主义竞赛
    按其性质来说，是社会主义生产方式所固有的，它
    只有在社会主义基础的条件下才是可能的。竞赛是
    我国建设的共产主义方法，是发展社会主义生产方
    式的积极力量。社会主义竞赛对于进行生产活动的
    人，对于人们在生产过程中协力合作与互助的关
    系，对于社会主义生产关系的发展与巩固有很大影
    响。
    工会为了执行第十六次党代表会议关于开展社会
    主义竞赛的历史性号召，在前几个五年计划时期，
    发动了群众的创造积极性去完成列宁、斯大林关于
    国家工业化和农业集体化的计划，去参加我国社会
    主义的建设。
    在伟大卫国战争的年代里，工会在群众中进行了
    紧张的组织工作与教育工作。工会支持了人民群众在开展全苏社会主义竞赛中的主动性，它们对于战
    胜敌人做了相当的贡献。
    在伟大卫国战争胜利结束以后，工会根据列宁、斯大林党的号召，领导了争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的社会主义竞赛。
    在最近几年，社会主义竞赛处于新的高涨中，它已具有全民的性质，并以各种新的形式丰富起来了。现在，竞赛的参加者不但注意生产的数量指标，同时也注意生产的质量指标。
    苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议关于领导社会主义竞赛的指示，为在工业、运输业、农业和建筑工程中进一步开展竞赛开辟了广阔的前途。
    由于国民经济在最近几年中发生了质的变化，所以，在一九五一年通过了新的全苏社会主义竞赛条件。根据新的条件，社会主义竞赛优胜者的主要标志就是：每一车间、每一企业按照规定的产品项目表与产品种类完成国家计划；大力提高产品质量和降低成本；节省原料和材料；正确地使用工业和农业的内在潜力；推广新技术；进一步提高劳动生产率和生产文化。
    社会主义竞赛问题在工会组织的工作中占重要的地位。工会遵循着党的指示和第十次工会代表大会的决议，支持并发挥生产革新者的主动性，协助大规模推广先进劳动方法，帮助竞赛者制定社会主义竞赛条件，进行竞赛总结，举办斯达哈诺夫学校，组织生产先进者的演讲会和座谈会，通过工厂刊物、招贴画、广播等来宣传斯达哈诺夫式工作者的经验，出版关于斯达哈诺夫式工作者的书籍。
    工会在布尔什维克党的领导下所组织的社会主义竞赛，是苏维埃社会向共产主义发展的强大动力。
    竞赛对于社会主义经济的巩固具有极其重大的意义。在社会主义竞赛的基础上，国民经济计划顺利完成着，工业、运输业和农业的一切部门在迅速地发展。一九五一年的总结，令人信服地证明了这一点。一九五一年全年在工业方面，产品总量计划完成百分之一○三·五；工业产品总量较一九五○年增加百分之十六，而劳动生产率在一年之内提高了百分之十。伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯和阿姆·达里亚的斯大林建设工程一九五一年度的计划任务胜利地完成了。一九五一年，祖国的机器制造业创造了将近五百种新牌和新型的机器与机械。在一年的时间内，采用了将近七十万件由工人和工程技术人员所提出的、旨在改善或根本改进生产过程的发明与合理化建议。一九五一年，由于降低工业产品的成本，节约了二百六十多亿卢布。
    这样，苏联工会通过组织社会主义竞赛的方式，对于社会主义生产给予积极的影响，以动员群众提高劳动生产率，改善劳动组织，改进生产过程、技术和劳动工具的方法，加速社会主义生产的发展。对于苏联社会生产力发展的这种影响，不是直接发生的，而是通过竞赛对于社会主义生产关系的影响而发生的。
    共产主义就是意味高度的劳动生产率，这是创造丰富的消费品所必需的，有了丰富的消费品才能从社会主义过渡到共产主义去。“共产主义——列宁写道——就是利用先进技术的那些自愿、自觉、联合着的工人所创造出来较资本主义更高的劳动生产率”（列宁文选第二卷五九七页）。
    劳动生产率的高涨，首先就要求有大工业物质基础的保证。但如果没有人民群众的教育高涨与文化高涨，如果没有劳动纪律的提高及更好的劳动组织，劳动生产率的高涨也是不可思议的。
    任何一个社会制度，都必定具有它自己所特有的劳动纪律。但与资本主义的饥饿和强迫的劳动纪律相反，社会主义的社会劳动组织，是以自觉的劳动态度，是以那些不是为剥削者，而是为自己、为自己的社会而工作，并且生产的结果与其唇齿相关的，劳动群众主动性与创造积极性的广泛发展为基础的。
    苏维埃社会劳动纪律的自觉性质，是由于世界上最先进的社会主义经济制度底社会主义生产关系的性质所决定。
    但是，大家知道，意识总是落后于存在的。在我国已经建成社会主义，并以迅速的步伐由社会主义向共产主义过渡。但在一些苏维埃人的意识中，仍然有阻碍苏维埃社会向前发展的资本主义残余。这些残余特别是表现在破坏劳动纪律、忽视国家利益和生产利益，以及对待劳动和公共财产的非社会主义态度等事情上面。由此可知，上层建筑在培养共产主义的劳动态度和自觉的劳动纪律中具有极其巨大的作用。
    斯大林同志在第十六次党代表大会上指出，提高劳动生产率的问题，应该从三方面来解决：改善劳动群众的物质状况，培养同志般的劳动纪律和组织社会主义竞赛。
    在共产党的领导下，工会进行着巨大的培养同志般劳动纪律的工作。列宁写道：工会是以它的教育、影响、宣传和对生产与纪律的深切关怀来培养劳动纪律的。由于本身的群众性以及与劳动群众的直接、密切的联系，工会在这一工作中具有充分的可能。工会拥有很多的文化机构网——俱乐部、文化宫、红角、图书馆、电影设备等等。它们进行着各方面的群众教育工作。为数在一千一百万人以上的工会积极分子大军，是一个巨大的力量。工会积极分子以在群众中的模范行动，组织工作和解释工作，来影响落后工人。严格遵守国家纪律和劳动纪律，是工会章程对每一个工会会员的主要要求之一。
    自觉的劳动纪律，是在社会主义竞赛的过程中，是由于工人群众创造主动性和自动性的发展，由于在千百万竞赛者中间进行经常的解释工作，并借助于作为工会工作基本方法的说服方法而培养出来的。
    签订集体合同，行政方面和工会组织履行自己在集体合同中所承担的义务，实行社会主义的劳动报酬原则（工会应对其实施进行监督），对于上述问题的解决，具有巨大的意义。
    自觉纪律的培养，是和教育群众以爱护的态度和社会主义态度对待社会财富的教育密切相联的。爱护并巩固社会主义公共财产——苏维埃制度底神圣不可侵犯的基础、祖国繁荣和强盛的源泉、全体劳动人民生活富裕和文化生活的源泉——是工会章程中所规定的每个工人、职员，每个工会会员的重要义务。工会组织在这方面所进行的工作，对于社会主义生产的发展和社会主义经济基础的巩固，具有巨大的意义。
    这样，在工会的积极参加之下，在广大的职工群众中间培育着对待劳动和公共财产的共产主义态度，不断地发展着摆脱了剥削的工作者之间的同志合作和互助的关系，这种关系是社会主义制度的特征。社会主义生产关系的巩固，对于苏维埃社会生产力的发展，起着积极的影响。×××
    工会管理国家社会保险事业，是作为上层建筑之一部分的工会对社会主义基础服务的具体形式之一。
    不能“一般地”解决社会保险问题。必须严格地将沙俄和资本主义国家的社会保险与苏联和人民民主国家的社会保险加以区分。
    资本主义社会的社会保险，是资产阶级政府所实行的“工厂法”的一部分。斯大林同志教导我们，“工厂法”只有在工人运动由初级阶段过渡到高级阶段，变为群众性的和有组织的运动，只有在以前散漫的无产阶级的力量，走向联合并组成统一的阶级的时候才能产生。
    沙皇俄国的情况也是这样。在工人运动还未具有群众性和组织性的时候，沙皇政府对付工人运动的手段只有一种，这就是监狱、西伯利亚、鞭笞和绞架。但当无产阶级有组织的群众参加了阶级斗争的时候，反动派除旧的手段之外，不得不采取了新的“比较文明的”的手段——“工厂法”——来反对工人运动。反动派以对工人作某些让步的方法，指望分裂无产阶级的团结，争取落后工人的信任，然后使他们放弃斗争。
    由此可以得出结论，资本主义国家的一切“工厂法”，包括社会保险法在内，都是资产阶级政府由于无产阶级争取生活权利的斗争日益加强，而被迫所做的让步。
    “没有原因，没有斗争——斯大林同志写道——是不会出现任何‘工厂法’的。在工人还没有进行斗争，当政府还没有必要满足工人的要求的时候，政府是不会颁布任何‘工厂法’的。”（斯大林全集俄文版第一卷第二九一页）
    对于资本主义国家的社会保险法，也必须以这种观点去认识。一九一二年的保险法草案以及后来的沙皇俄国社会保险法，便是一九一一年至一九一二年内工人阶级新的革命高涨的直接结果。但是，这个法案远不能满足布尔什维克党晋拉加代表会议所提出的列宁保险纲领的要求。这个法案是沙皇政府在工人运动的压力下被迫所做的一种极其有限的让步。
    显然，资本主义的基础由于本身的矛盾，在一定的情况下，要求资产阶级政府，也就是要求其上层建筑进行一定的改良，这些改良在形式上是对工人阶级的让步，但按其实质来说，乃是为了保护这一基础。
    如果这一改良是沙皇政府被迫进行，并且具有分裂工人运动，以保持资产阶级统治的目的的话，那末，对于工人阶级来说，争取社会保险的斗争，不但是保护工人阶级，使免于“体力上和精神上的堕落”（列宁语）的斗争，而且是教育工人阶级的学校，是组织工人阶级为争取彻底解放而斗争的学校。这是因为，正如列宁所指出：“彻底推翻沙皇制度，争取无产阶级自由阶级斗争的条件，是实行真正符合无产阶级利益的保险改革的必要条件。”
    （列宁全集俄文版第一卷二九一页至二九二页）斯大林同志强调指出：任何一种“工厂法”，“不论它是多么坏的法案，但是其中总有几条可以被无产阶级利用来加强自己的斗争。”（斯大林全集俄文版第一卷二九一页至二九二页）
    因此，资本主义国家的“工厂法”，包括社会保险法在内，是在根本上与无产阶级相敌对的。马克思写道：从最初起，关于雇佣劳动的立法就是为了剥削工人阶级，而在其继续发展中，无疑的是始终与工人阶级相敌对的。但是，争取社会保险的斗争是无产阶级总的阶级斗争的一部分，如果无产阶级的党不准许资产阶级思想家将这个斗争引入纯粹改良主义，不准将其与政治斗争相隔离的话，那末这一斗争对于工人阶级争取自己解放的斗争事业有着极其重要的贡献。
    由此可以做出结论，资本主义制度下的保险法，和一般“工厂法”一样，甚至不能算做社会主义上层建筑的萌芽形式。因为在资本主义制度下既没有它必须成为其一部分的社会主义法律，更没有它所应服务的社会主义基础。资产阶级社会的“工厂法”是资本主义基础底法律上层建筑的一部分，因为它是借欺骗工人阶级和分裂工人运动的方法来保护资本主义基础的。
    同时，作为资本主义上层建筑之一部分的保险法，是有其特点的。首先必须指出，保险法乃是在资本主义基础的根基已经动摇的时候产生的，所以它被迫为保护资本主义基础进行比巩固资本主义基础所作的斗争要多些。第一，与无产阶级斗争直接关联的保险法，在资本主义条件下，仅能完成极其有限的职能。其次，社会保险法的通过，客观上是在促进无产阶级反对资本主义基础的斗争的加强。
    实行真正符合工人利益的包罗万象的社会保险纲领，只有在工人阶级取得胜利并掌握政权以后，才是可能的。在苏联已彻底实现了列宁底保险纲领，苏联的社会保险是工人阶级由于伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利而获得的最主要成果之一。
    大家知道，在苏联，社会保险的一切开支都由国家负担。国家社会保险的全部实际工作，由工会——我国职工底最富有群众性的组织——进行。社会保险经费由企业和机关必须交纳的保险金组成。这就是说，社会保险预算的增加，完全取决于国家的社会主义财富的增加。
    苏联的国家社会保险，是社会主义基础的产物，是社会主义生产关系的产物。社会保险对于发展和进一步巩固社会主义基础，是一个重要的武器。社会保险可以促进职工社会主义劳动态度的培养和劳动群众生活、物质状况以及文化状况的改善。这一切使我们有充分的根据，认为苏联的国家社会保险是社会主义上层建筑的职能之一。×××
    苏维埃国家的工会，是社会主义基础的政治上层建筑的重要组成部分。苏联工会之所以有力，就是因为它在共产党——苏联人民争取共产主义的斗争中一切胜利的组织者与鼓舞者——的领导下来工作、发展和巩固。工会起着统一的学校，团结的学校，管理、吸引与教育的学校，共产主义的学校的作用。工会是教育的组织，工人和职员在这个组织中学习管理国家和管理生产。
    工会将共产党与最广泛的劳动者群众联系起来。工会不是国家组织，不是强制的组织。它首先是以说服、解释和广泛宣传的力量来影响群众，发展工人群众的政治和创造主动性与自动性。
    工会以自己在布尔什维克党指导下进行的各种活动，并在与工人阶级专政体系的其他“引带”和“杠杆”密切的联系下，来帮助社会主义基础及其上层建筑——苏维埃国家——的巩固。
    斯大林同志关于语言学问题的天才著作，以新的结论和原理丰富了马克思列宁主义理论，这些结论和原理不但对于一切科学的发展，而且对于共产主义建设的全部事业具有重大的意义。
    斯大林同志关于上层建筑在社会发展中作用的指示，使我们更深刻地领会到苏维埃思想和一切苏维埃机关与组织，包括工会在内，对于巩固社会主义经济制度、继续增强社会主义国家的经济实力和政治实力，提高苏维埃人民的生活水准与文化以及加速苏维埃社会过渡到共产主义的速度的巨大意义。（中华全国总工会俄文翻译室译自苏联
