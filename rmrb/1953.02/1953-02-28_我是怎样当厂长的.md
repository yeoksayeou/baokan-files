    How I Became a Factory Director
    A speech by Yan Ming, Director of the Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
                                Recorded by Ai Zhi
    Editor's Note: This autobiographical article by Comrade Yan Ming, director of the Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, vividly introduces his process of gradually transforming from a layman in industrial production to an expert. He resolutely relied on the masses of workers and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, went deep into the workshops, studied the business, and worked with the workers to solve the key problems in the current work, quickly transforming a factory with backward equipment, frequent production of defective products, and frequent accidents into a mechanized and automated factory (news has already appeared on the first page of this newspaper on January 31). His experience is worthy of attention by every factory manager and technical personnel.
    You ask me about my experience as a factory director. To be honest, I don't think I'm qualified to talk about this issue yet, because I've only been a factory director for ten months. So I can only talk about my work experience and a little understanding in these ten months. Before I say this, I would like to talk about my work experience first.
    I am twenty-eight years old this year and have only studied for three years. Five years ago, I was still a correspondent for a county party secretary comrade, and more than three years ago, I was still an ordinary rural work cadre who had never seen a factory. In the winter of 1949, the Party transferred me to work in Anshan. It was not until April of last year that I was appointed as the director of the Small Rolling Mill and began to learn factory management. This is my simple work experience. I want to say this not to explain anything else, but to explain the great role of relying on the masses and relying on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Because, I believe that the reason why the Small Rolling Mill has made some achievements in the past ten months is most importantly because I and many other comrades in the Small Rolling Mill, under the leadership of the Party, have initially accepted this work experience that has been proven by numerous facts in the industrial construction of the Northeast, which is: closely relying on the masses of workers, not committing bureaucracy, and closely relying on advanced Soviet technical guidance, and asking Soviet experts for advice when there are difficulties. As for myself, I think I am a cadre with poor work experience and cultural level. Now I will go back and talk about my work experience and insights in the past ten months.
    In April of last year, after the original five main administrative management cadres and technical personnel of the Small Rolling Mill were transferred to do basic construction work, I began to serve as the factory director. In the past, although I had done party work in the Small Rolling Mill for a long time, I was still very unfamiliar with administrative management work. Therefore, when I first accepted this work, I was very afraid of doing the work badly and causing losses to the Party and the country. However, since the superiors asked me to do this work, I could not shrink back. So, after a period of thinking, I made up my mind to rely on the work experience that has been proven by countless facts in the Northeast industrial construction to engage in this new work. That is: closely rely on the masses of workers, do not commit bureaucraticism, and closely rely on advanced Soviet technical guidance, and consult Soviet experts for any difficulties.
    Not long after I became the factory director, the work of the Small Rolling Mill seemed to be deliberately causing trouble for me, and there were two consecutive fatal accidents. So I had to first grasp the security work. At that time, I wanted to complete some of the most urgent security work first, and then work step by step. But after I roughly completed this work, another troublesome problem of producing three hundred tons of defective products a day appeared. From this series of facts, I felt that the illness of the Small Rolling Mill was serious. For such a factory, the method of
    "patching" cannot solve the problem. Therefore, after briefly arranging the daily work, I first started my first step: finding the root cause, by studying the problem of defective products, according to the method I had predetermined for myself.
    It was in early May. I proposed to the Party Committee to mobilize all cadres in the factory to go to the workshop and start with the study of defective products to find the root cause of the problem. This proposal immediately received the support of the Party Committee. So the Party Committee, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League jointly organized fifty-six cadres to go to the workshop. I also went down.
    After I arrived at the workshop, I first talked to Zhao Shouku, a worker who was considered to be the most backward. No one had ever talked to him before, but I learned a lot from him. I asked him: "What do you think is the problem with our defective products?" He said: "The problem is very clear. A good horse must be ridden by a good rider. I think the problem lies in the fact that the people who use the rolling mill do not use it well." Then he said a lot about the unreasonable operation of the rolling mill workers. From this, I discovered the confusion in production organization and operation. After I finished talking with him, I talked to Fu Zhiguo, who was doing the best job. He said: "I think the problem with the large number of defective products lies in the rolling groove. If there is no problem with it, there will never be so many defective products!" From his conversation, I learned that there was a problem with the rolling groove. Then, I talked to the squad leader Pan Fengquan. Pan Fengquan told me another situation. He said: After two fatal accidents, the workers' morale was very low. They said: Rolling steel is tiring and dangerous, so you have to be careful! Otherwise, you will lose your life in an instant. Therefore, there are particularly many cases of running pliers and hitting sleeves (that is, the steel bar is not immediately clamped and sent into the rolling mill). From his conversation, I learned that this kind of backward equipment in the Small Rolling Mill not only hindered the improvement of production, but also seriously threatened the health and safety of the workers. Therefore, how to improve the equipment is not only the fundamental problem of improving the quantity and quality of products, but also the fundamental problem of liberating workers from dangerous and heavy physical labor.
    The problems in the workshop are always similar. After going down to the workshop for several days in a row, I gathered the opinions of dozens of cadres and found that the reasons for the poor production of the whole factory were: 1. The equipment was poor; 2. The operation was unreasonable; 3. The system was chaotic. At the same time, I also found that the fundamental reason for this phenomenon was the bureaucracy of the leadership and the failure to fully rely on the masses. Because the above-mentioned specific problems could have been solved long ago, but in the past, the masses were not mobilized to solve them well. In addition, we also discovered many advanced working methods that workers have already created.
    The disease has been found, but where should we start to treat it? After touching these problems, we held another Party Committee meeting to study them. The result of the research was: the equipment problem is the most important, but this problem cannot be solved all at once, so we should first establish a responsibility system and other necessary working systems, and solve the technical and operational problems such as the bad rolling groove and the large number of running pliers and hitting sleeves, so as to seek to initially clarify the chaotic situation in the factory, and then vigorously mobilize the masses and concentrate efforts to solve the equipment problem. At the meeting, we divided the work and stipulated the work and practices of the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League. At that time, I was assigned to organize workers and technicians to study technical and operational issues and establish systems; the Party and the Communist Youth League were to mobilize Party members and Youth League members to ensure; the trade union was to mobilize the masses to engage in a movement to prevent running pliers and hitting sleeves, and through this movement, improve management and solve operational problems.
    During this period, I mainly focused on technology and operation. First, I discussed the rolling groove problem with the workers and technicians, put forward improvement suggestions, and finally asked the experts for instructions. As a result, the rolling groove problem was solved in a few days. Along with it, the situation of producing three hundred tons of defective products a day also disappeared. So I began to study the operation problem with the workers and technicians. When studying this problem, because I did not understand the operation technology, I felt very strenuous, but I was determined to understand it. I thought, how can a factory director lead if he doesn't even understand a little bit of operation technology? So I stood in front of the rolling mill for three consecutive days. It was quick, in just three days, I not only understood the basic methods of operation, but also discovered a new problem, that is: the original rolling method of entering the first and third holes at the same time was unscientific, and it should be entering the first, third, and fifth holes at the same time. That is to say, three steel bars should be rolled at a time, instead of rolling two, so that more rolling will be done. I discussed this problem with the workers and technicians, and they all said it was possible, but at the same time, they also raised some difficulties. According to these opinions, I discussed with several workers and technicians the solution to these difficulties. Because everyone participating in this research worked very hard, a solution was found in less than three days. On the fourth day, we started working. Once we started, the output increased by 14%. Because the workers rolled steel quickly with this method, they called it the "fast rolling method."
    Following the discovery of this method, we launched a movement to promote the "fast rolling method" while establishing systems and conducting reasonable operations. The method of promotion was to first cultivate the Jiang Xingjia Youth Group to conduct a trial run by me and several comrades of the Party Committee, and then perform and promote it. Because we mobilized the workers to work better through various organizations such as the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League, the whole factory was completely promoted in less than a month.
    At this point, our work was considered to have come to an end. Because after carrying out the above work, not only did it initially change the original chaotic situation, but it also gave us the conditions to concentrate our efforts, mobilize the masses, and fundamentally improve the equipment. Therefore, from July, we turned the spearhead of our work to this aspect.
    The equipment transformation problem of the Small Rolling Mill is a major problem that is directly related to the lives of the workers. To mention the equipment transformation movement, we have to go back to three years ago. Three years ago, not long after we took over the Small Rolling Mill, the workers said: "Now we have only turned over once, and there is still one more turn to be made, that is, our equipment is too bad, and it is too painful to work!" At that time, many workers such as Zhang Mingshan put forward suggestions for transformation, but they did not attract the attention of the leaders at that time, because they heard the old technicians say that it was impossible. In this way, the workers' enthusiasm for creation was suppressed. To be honest, at the beginning of our equipment transformation movement this time, we were also afraid of not doing it well, but at this time, the success of worker Zhou Dianchen in creating a vertical retaining plate strengthened our confidence. So we decided to tackle this problem. However, Zhou Dianchen's vertical retaining plate was relatively simple, but the reforms we needed were many, and some of them had not been successfully tested in capitalist countries. For example, the anti-retaining plate on the rolling mill is like this. So in July, we first decided to vigorously support Zhang Mingshan's proposal to create an anti-retaining plate, in order to break the conservative thinking of some technicians and workers who lacked confidence through this creation, and create conditions for carrying out the movement in the whole factory. In order to help Zhang Mingshan's creation, we gave Zhang Mingshan various help in terms of time, manpower, and materials.
    After two months of effort, on September 14, Zhang Mingshan's anti-retaining plate was successfully created. This incident immediately gave all the workers great encouragement. We seized this opportunity and, according to the instructions of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward to all the workers the slogan: "Learn from Zhang Mingshan, carry out a mechanization and automation movement in the whole factory, and strive for the mechanization and automation of the whole factory." Because this slogan hit the key point of the whole factory, a large-scale equipment transformation movement in the whole factory quickly unfolded. After the movement started, fifteen major creations and twenty-three major reforms appeared before the end of the year, thereby mechanizing and automating the main processes of the whole factory and increasing production efficiency by 40%.
    During the movement, as a factory director, I did the following work: First, I personally organized the mechanization and automation work group of the whole factory, organized all the people who had creativity and improvement, and carried out collective creation research; Second, I personally participated in the review of each worker's creation and improvement suggestions; Third, organized technical personnel and related workers to help those who put forward creation and rationalization suggestions; Fourth, timely told these creations to Soviet experts, asked Soviet experts to review them, and organized all forces to resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts; Fifth, I personally participated in the experiment of each major creation in order to understand the specific difficulties of the workers in the creation and solve them. For example, Zhang Mingshan encountered many problems when experimenting with the anti-retaining plate. In order to solve these problems, I lived in the factory for eight days and seven nights. Now our factory's movement has not ended, and we are still continuing our efforts. This is my main work experience in the past ten months. Now I want to talk about some of my insights in the past ten months.
    The working principle that I have always adhered to in the past ten months is the "old experience" mentioned above. Therefore, my experience is also about this aspect. To sum up, I have three experiences: The first is that the problem of relying on the masses of workers and relying on the advanced technical guidance of the Soviet Union is not an ordinary working method problem, but a sign of whether you can manage the enterprise well. The key to whether this problem can be done well lies in whether you trust the working class and trust the advanced experience of socialism. Therefore, this problem is a major problem related to the position. The second is that the way to implement this experience is mainly not in the meeting, of course not in the office, but in the workshop, in every specific work. Leaving every work and seemingly insignificant small things will never be able to implement it. The third is that you must be familiar with your own business and participate in mass work, otherwise, you will not understand the specific problems in the work and the ideological requirements of the masses.
    I think that I still have many shortcomings in implementing these fundamental policies. For example, in terms of relying on the masses of workers, I have not yet made approaching the workers, listening to the workers' opinions and criticisms a regular working system. In relying on the advanced technical guidance of the Soviet Union, I have not yet formulated a complete and strict method for how to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts...etc. So I am now checking the shortcomings in this area, correcting them, and striving to further implement this fundamental work experience that the Party has repeatedly instructed and has been proven by countless facts in order to further overcome my shortcomings in the work.

    我是怎样当厂长的
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂厂长　燕鸣讲
                                艾直　记
    编者按：鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂厂长燕鸣同志的这篇自述文章，生动地介绍了他从工业生产方面的外行逐渐变成内行的过程。他坚决地依靠工人群众和苏联的先进经验，深入车间，学习业务，和工人一起解决当前工作中的关键问题，把一个设备落后、经常产生废品和发生事故的工厂，迅速改造成一个机械化、自动化的工厂（消息已见一月三十一日本报第一版）。他的经验，值得每一个工厂管理人员和技术人员的重视。
    你问我做厂长的经验，老实说，我认为我还没有谈这问题的资格。因为我才做了十个月的厂长。所以我只能说说我这十个月的工作经过和一点体会。在说这些以前，我想先说一下我的工作经历。
    我今年二十八岁，只念过三年书。五年以前，我还是一个县委书记同志的通讯员，三年多以前我还是一个从未见过工厂的普通农村工作干部。一九四九年冬天，党调我到鞍山工作，到去年四月间，我才被委任为小型轧钢厂厂长，开始学习工厂管理。这就是我的简单工作经历。我要说这些，并不是为了说明别的，而是为了说明依靠群众与依靠苏联先进经验的重大作用。因为，我认为小型轧钢厂之所以在过去的十个月中，有一些成绩，最重要的就是我和小型轧钢厂的其他许多同志，在党的领导下，初步地接受了这条已为许多工厂特别是五三工厂所证明了的工作经验。至于我个人，我认为是一个工作经验和文化水平都很差的干部。现在我再回头来说说十个月来的工作经过和点滴体会。
    去年四月间，小型轧钢厂原来的五个主要行政管理干部和技术人员调去做基本建设工作之后，我才开始当厂长。过去，我虽在小型轧钢厂做过很长时间的党的工作，可是对行政管理工作还是很生疏，所以在我刚刚接受这一工作的时候，我很怕把工作做坏了，使党和国家受到损失。但是，既然上级叫我做这一工作，我也不能退缩，于是经过一段思索以后，我打定主意依靠已为东北工业建设无数事实所证明了的那条工作经验，来从事这一新的工作。那便是：紧紧依靠工人群众，不犯官僚主义，和紧紧依靠苏联先进技术指导，有困难多向苏联专家请教。
    我刚当厂长不几天，小型轧钢厂的工作好像专门向我闹别扭，连续发生两次死亡事故。于是我便不得不先抓保安工作。当时我想先做完一些最迫切的保安工作以后，再按部就班地工作。但是等我大体上做完了这一工作以后，又出现了一天产生三百吨废品的麻烦问题。从这一连串的事实中，我感到了小型轧钢厂的病症是沉重的。对于这样一个工厂，用
    “打补钉”的办法是不能解决问题的，所以我简单地安排一下日常工作以后，便首先按照我预先为自己规定的办法，通过研究废品的问题开始，我的第一步工作：找病根。
    那是五月初，我向党委会提出了动员全厂干部下车间，从研究废品问题入手，进行挖病根的建议。这个建议立即获得了党委会的支持。于是党委、行政、工会、青年团便统一组织五十六个干部到车间。我也下去了。
    我到车间以后，首先找了个有人认为是最落后的工人赵守库谈话。这个人，过去没有人找过他，可是我从他的口里学了很多东西。我问他：“你说我们出废品的毛病在哪里呢？”他说：“毛病很明白，好马还得好人骑，我看毛病就出在使轧钢机的人不好好使上。”接着他便把轧钢工人操作不合理的事说了一大堆。从这里我发现了生产组织及操作上的混乱。我和他谈完了以后，又找了个工作最好的傅治国谈话。他说：“我看废品多的毛病是出在轧槽上，若是它没有问题，绝不会出这么多废品！”从他的谈话中，我了解到轧槽上有问题。接着，我又找了班长潘凤全谈话。潘凤全告诉了我另外的情形，他说：出了两次死亡事故以后，工人情绪很低，说：轧钢又累又危险，可得小心！不然，一下就会要命的。所以最近跑钳、打套（即钢条出来没立即钳住送进轧钢机里）的特别多。从他的谈话中，我了解到小型轧钢厂这种落后设备，不仅阻碍了生产的提高，而且严重地威胁着工人的健康和安全。因此，如何改善设备，不仅是提高产品数量和质量的根本问题，也是把工人从危险笨重的体力劳动中解救出来的根本问题。
    车间的问题，总是大同小异的。连续下了几天车间以后，我把几十个干部的意见一集中，发现了全厂生产不好的原因是：一、设备不良；二、操作不合理；三、制度紊乱。同时也发现了产生这种现象的根本原因则是领导方面的官僚主义和没有充分依靠群众。因为上述具体问题，都是早就可以解决的，然而过去没有好好发动群众解决。除此之外，我们还发现了许多工人已经创造的先进工作方法。
    病是找到了，但从哪里治起呢？摸到这些问题以后，我们便又召开了一次党委会进行研究。研究的结果是：设备问题最重要，但这问题一下解决不了，所以应当首先建立责任制及其他一些必要的工作制度，和解决轧槽不好，跑钳、打套多等技术、操作问题，从而求得先初步澄清一下厂内的混乱情况，然后，再大力发动群众，集中力量解决设备问题。在会上我们分了工，规定出党、行政、工会、青年团的工作及做法等。当时我分的是组织工人技术人员研究技术、操作及建立制度等问题；党和青年团是动员党团员来保证；工会是发动群众搞不跑钳、不打套运动，并通过这一运动，改进管理及解决操作问题。
    在这个时期中，我主要地是抓技术、操作。首先我和工人及技术人员们研究轧槽问题，提出了改进的意见，最后又请示了专家。结果轧槽问题没用几天就解决了。随着，一天出三百吨废品的情况也消灭了。于是我又和工人、技术人员开始研究操作问题。在研究这个问题时，因为我不懂操作技术，所以感到很吃力，但我下决心要懂得它。我想，一个厂长连一点操作技术都不懂得，怎么进行领导呢？所以我在轧钢机前一连站了三天。说来也快，仅仅三天，我不但懂得了操作的基本方法，而且还发现了个新问题，那就是：原来一、三孔同入的轧钢法是不科学的，应当是一、三、五孔同入。这就是说，一次应轧三根钢，不要轧两根，这样就会多轧。我把这问题和工人、技术人员一商量，他们都说可以，但同时他们也提出了一些困难。我又根据这些意见，和几个工人、技术人员研究解决这些困难的办法。由于参加这一研究的人都很努力，所以没出三天，就找到解决的办法了。到了第四天，我们就干开了。一干，产量提高了百分之十四。工人们因为这办法轧钢快，就叫它“快速轧钢法”。
    跟着这个办法的发现，我们便在建立制度、进行合理操作的同时，展开了推行“快速轧钢法”的运动。推广的办法是首先由我和党委的几个同志培养姜兴家青年小组试行，然后再表演推广。因为我们通过党、行政、工会、青年团等各种组织，动员工人工作作的比较好，所以没上一个月，全厂便统统推广起来。
    到了这里，我们的工作算是告了一个段落。因为进行了上面的那些工作以后，不仅初步地改变了原来的混乱局面，同时也给了我们集中力量、发动群众、从根本上改进设备的条件。所以我们从七月份开始，便把工作的矛头，转向这一方面。
    小型轧钢厂的设备改造问题，是个直接与工人的生命联系着的大问题。要提到改造设备运动，还得说到三年以前。三年之前，我们接收小型轧钢厂不久，工人就说：“现在我们只翻了一个身，还有一个身没翻，那就是咱的设备太不好，干活太受罪！”当时工人张明山等很多人提出了改造的意见，可是没有引起当时领导方面的注意，因为他们听旧技术人员说那是不可能的。这样一来，工人的创造热情就被压下去了。老实说，我们这次搞改造设备运动的起初，也曾怕搞不好，可是就在这时候，工人周殿臣创造立围盘的成功，坚定了我们的信心。所以我们便下决心来搞这一问题。但是，周殿臣的立围盘比较简单，而我们所需的改革却很多，且有的是各资本主义国家没有试验成功的。比如光轧机上的反围盘就是如此。于是我们便在七月份首先决定大力支持张明山创制反围盘的建议，以便通过这一创造，打破部分技术人员及工人中信心不足的保守思想，为在全厂开展运动创造条件。为了帮助张明山的创造，我们给了张明山时间、人力、物资上各种帮助。
    经过两个月的努力，九月十四日，张明山的反围盘创造成功了。这件事立即给全体工人以极大的鼓舞。我们就抓紧这一机会，根据中共鞍山市委的指示，向全体工人提出了：“学习张明山，全厂开展机械化、自动化运动，为争取全厂机械化、自动化而斗争”的口号。因为这口号提的正打中了全厂的要害，所以一个全厂性的改造设备的大运动，就很快地展开了。运动起来以后，不到年底就出现了十五件重大创造和二十三件重大改革，从而使全厂主要工序达到了机械化、自动化，使生产效率提高百分之四十。
    在运动中间，作为一个厂长，我做了以下几个工作：第一，我亲自组织了全厂的机械化、自动化工作小组，把全体有创造、改进的人组织起来，进行了集体创造研究；第二，我亲自参加了对每个工人的创造与改进建议的审查；第三，组织技术人员及有关工人对提出创造与合理化建议者进行帮助；第四，及时地把这些创造告诉苏联专家，请苏联专家加以审查，并组织了一切力量，坚决贯彻了苏联专家的建议；第五，每件重大创造的试验，我都亲自参加，用以了解工人们在创造中的具体困难，加以解决。比如，张明山在试验反围盘时，曾碰到了许多问题，为了解决这些问题，我在厂里住了八天七宿。现在我们厂的运动还没有结束，我们还在继续努力。这就是十个月来，我的主要工作经过。现在我要说说我十个月中的一些体会。
    十个月中，我所始终信守的工作原则便是上面说过的那条“老经验”。因此，我的体会也是述说这方面的。总括起来，我的体会有三条：头一条是，依靠工人群众和依靠苏联先进技术指导的问题，不是一个普通的工作方法问题，而是一个能否管好企业的标志。能否把这一问题做好的关键，则在于是不是信任工人阶级，及信任社会主义先进经验。因此，这一问题是个有关立场的大问题。第二条是，贯彻这一经验的办法主要不是在会议上，当然也不是在办公室里，而是在车间，在每个具体的工作中，离开了每件工作，和似乎不值得注意的小事，是永远也不能贯彻的。第三条是，必须熟悉自己的业务和参加群众工作，否则，就不会了解工作中的具体问题和群众的思想要求。
    我认为，我在执行这几条根本性的方针中，还有很多缺点，比如在依靠工人群众方面，我还没有把接近工人听取工人的意见和批评订为一种正规的工作制度。在依靠苏联先进技术指导中，还没有把如何贯彻苏联专家建议，订出一种完整严密的办法……等。所以我现在正在检查这一方面的缺点，加以纠正，力求进一步贯彻这条党一再指示而又为无数事实所证明了的根本性的工作经验，以进一步克服我在工作上的缺点。
