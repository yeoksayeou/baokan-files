With the completion of the economic recovery task, our country is facing the arduous task of large-scale construction. The Party has timely called for placing capital construction in a primary position, which is completely correct and must be adhered to and implemented. However, this does not mean that putting capital construction in a primary position allows us to relax or abandon leadership over production. On the contrary, with the advent of large-scale construction, the tasks of the industrial production sector are even more significant. It must increase production, practice strict economy, and accumulate more funds for the country's large-scale construction. It must also closely cooperate with and support capital construction, fully and timely supply capital construction with high-quality building materials, machinery and power equipment, as well as fuel, tools, etc., so that the country's important construction projects can be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. It must also do its utmost to meet the production and living needs of the people, supplying the people with high-quality and low-priced products. This requires every industrial production department and factory to strengthen and improve leadership over production, and to closely integrate the production plan with the overall plan of the national economy, in order to accomplish the above-mentioned important tasks. It would be a clear mistake for anyone to place capital construction in opposition to production, thereby relaxing leadership over production.

The central task of production departments and factories at present is to correctly formulate the 1953 production plan and mobilize the masses to discuss it, so that on the basis of a correct plan, the work for the whole year can be properly arranged, and all personnel can be mobilized and organized to strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks stipulated by the state.

To correctly formulate a plan, we must oppose backwardness and conservatism. In our state-owned factories and local state-owned factories, there are some cadres who stick to conventions, do not pay attention to giving play to the potential strength of enterprises, do not study and analyze the economic activities of enterprises, do not understand the great creativity of the working class, and do not try to improve labor organization, promote advanced experience, give full play to equipment capacity, and rationally and economically utilize materials. Instead, they formulate plans according to weak links, or only emphasize unfavorable factors, ignore favorable factors, only compare with old quotas, and do not adopt average advanced quotas. They are satisfied with the achievements they have made and do not seek progress, so the plans they set are often conservative, especially the financial plans and cost plans. There are also some cadres whose bureaucratic style is very serious. They are ignorant of the production situation and various advanced quotas, have no idea what is going on, turn a blind eye to new things, doubt the existence of potential strength, always want to maintain the status quo, and are afraid that raising the plan will lead to failure to complete it and being criticized by higher authorities. Therefore, the plans they set are always in a backward state year after year. There are also individual people who are of bad character. For improper personal purposes, they deliberately lower the plan and falsely report costs, so that they can complete and exceed the plan without much effort, fraudulently obtain state bonuses, and earn personal fame and status. Therefore, in formulating this year's production plan, we must wage a resolute struggle against the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and styles, expose and criticize conservative ideas and bureaucracy, and punish those who falsely report costs, deliberately lower plans, and deceive the state. Only in this way can we formulate correct and advanced production plans based on average advanced technical and economic quotas and through precise calculations.

To correctly formulate a plan, it is necessary to overcome blindness in accordance with the principle of need and possibility. Today, for a few of our products, such as matches, sacks, cigarettes, coal, etc., the quantity produced temporarily exceeds the current needs and purchasing power of the people. If we continue to increase production, it will inevitably lead to stockpiling, which will also cause economic losses to the state. Therefore, for such products, the current task is not to increase production, but to strive to improve quality and reduce costs. Many of our state-owned enterprise departments not only have blindness in capital construction, but also have varying degrees of blindness in production. For example, the quantity and variety of production are out of touch with the needs of society, and the number of workers and technical equipment are blindly increased without calculating the needs. These are all manifestations of blindness. Therefore, while opposing conservative ideas, we must also pay attention to preventing and overcoming the tendency of blindly increasing production.

To correctly formulate a plan, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive planning perspective. That is to say, not only should the quantity of products be considered, but also the variety, quality, cost, and capital turnover of the products should be considered at the same time. Some of our factories only pay attention to the production plan when formulating plans, only focusing on whether the total output value has increased, but not paying enough attention to the plan for product variety and quality, and paying even less attention to the cost plan, financial plan, and labor plan. Therefore, this creates a one-sidedness in the plan, and serious unreasonable phenomena occur in the implementation of the plan. For example, although most of the products of some factories have completed or even exceeded the plan, and the total output value has also been completed, some major products have not completed the plan. Some factories have completed the production plan, but have not completed the quality plan, or have not completed the cost and financial plans. Some even have more production, more waste products and defective products, and higher costs, causing great losses to the state. The bad consequences caused by this partial, that is, one-sided, formulation and implementation of the plan are not only a great waste and cannot truly complete the plan tasks assigned by the state, but also affect the improvement of the leadership level and the improvement of work in the enterprise. Therefore, industrial production departments must educate cadres to establish a comprehensive planning perspective when formulating plans, and ideologically unify the completion of output and the improvement of quality and the reduction of costs, prevent and overcome the idea and practice of only caring about quantity and not quality, and only caring about production and not cost, and earnestly formulate product, labor, material supply, financial, and cost plans, and implement them in the execution, so that our industrial products can truly achieve "more, better, and cheaper."

It should be emphasized here that having a plan does not mean that the planning work has been completed, let alone that the plan will definitely be realized. Without exception, any plan must be guaranteed to be realized through the conscious and active actions of employees. Therefore, mobilizing employees to fully and widely discuss the plan is an indispensable step in formulating and implementing the plan. Past experience has proven that after the plan has been discussed by employees, it can avoid and overcome conservative ideas or adventurous tendencies. Employee discussions are particularly effective in correcting conservative tendencies. At the same time, only after the plan has been discussed by employees can it become a plan that combines leadership and the masses, enabling all employees to give full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity and work hard to complete the plan. It is obviously wrong and will never be able to do a good job of planning to not mobilize the masses to discuss the plan and think that the responsibility of formulating the enterprise plan is only the responsibility of a few leading cadres or the planning department.

Mobilizing all employees of factories and mines to discuss the plan is by no means a matter of simply announcing it to the masses in a formalistic way and raising hands to pass it. In addition to publicizing the significance of the plan, the specific tasks of the unit, and the favorable and unfavorable conditions and various measures for completing the plan to the employees, there should be enough time for the masses to deliberate and discuss. First of all, we should discuss how to fully tap the potential of the enterprise, find key problems in production, discover weak links, and study solutions, so that the discussion of the plan can be combined with the mass movement to find tricks and rationalization proposals, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and promote production. In the discussion, the idea that "potential has been exhausted" and "tricks have been found" should be criticized and corrected. Secondly, in conjunction with the discussion of the plan, the leaders at all levels of the factory and mine should summarize and promote various advanced experiences in production, and grasp the main experiences among them, and focus on promoting them in conjunction with the current problems in production. Thirdly, the factory and mine plan formulated according to the state plan's production indicators should become the actual action of all employees, and the plans of workshops, groups, or individuals should also be formulated, so that each employee has specific goals to strive for. The plans of such workshops, groups, and individuals are best formulated through group or individual patriotic conventions. At the same time, on this basis, contact contracts are signed to coordinate and connect the plans of various workshops, groups, and individuals. Finally, when discussing the plan, the form of collective contracts should be adopted to solve the problems of safe production and welfare, so as to educate employees to understand the truth that personal interests are completely consistent with national interests.

Mobilizing the masses of employees to discuss the plan is a concrete manifestation of the combination of political work and economic work. Through this discussion, the political education of the masses of employees should be strengthened, and important problems in production should be solved at the same time. The successful experience of the Shenyang 53 Factory in ideological education should also be specifically applied to the work of mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan. 1953 is the first year of the implementation of the state's five-year construction plan, and our cause should have a good start. Correctly formulating a plan is the primary link in this good start. If we have a correct and practical plan, and can constantly check the implementation of the plan, promote good experiences in implementing and completing the plan, and correct certain shortcomings and errors in the plan, then, with the efforts of all employees, the industrial production plan for 1953 can definitely be successfully completed and exceeded.

### 发动群众制定和讨论今年的工业生产计划

    发动群众制定和讨论今年的工业生产计划
    由于经济恢复任务的完成，我国面临大规模建设的艰巨任务，党及时地号召把基本建设放到首要地位，这是完全正确的，是必须坚持贯彻实现的。但这并不是说，把基本建设放到首要地位，就可以放松或放弃对生产的领导。恰恰相反，随着大规模建设的到来，工业生产部门的任务更加重大了。它必须增加生产，厉行节约，为国家大规模建设积累更多的资金；它又必须密切配合和支援基本建设，充分地和及时地供应基本建设以优良的建筑材料、机械和动力等设备以及燃料、工具等，使国家建设的重要工程能如期或提前完工；它还必须以最大可能去满足人民群众的生产和生活的需要，供应人民以质好价廉的产品。这就要求每一个工业生产部门和厂矿加强和改进对生产的领导，并使生产计划与国民经济的整个计划密切相结合，以完成上述各项重大任务。如果有人把基本建设与生产相对立，以致放松对生产的领导，那显然是错误的。
    当前生产部门和厂矿的中心工作，在于正确地制定一九五三年的生产计划，并发动群众讨论，以便在正确的计划的基础上，妥善布置全年的工作，动员和组织全体人员为完成和超额完成国家所规定的任务而努力。
    正确地制定计划，就必须反对落后，反对保守。在我们国营厂矿和地方国营厂矿中，有一些干部，墨守成规，不注意发挥企业的潜在力量，不研究分析企业的经济活动，不了解工人阶级伟大的创造力，不设法改善劳动组织、推广先进经验、充分发挥设备能力、合理和节约地利用材料，而是按照薄弱环节制定计划；或者只强调不利因素，漠视有利因素，只同旧的定额比，而不采用平均先进定额，满足于已得成绩，不求进步，以致所定计划，常常是保守的，特别是财务计划和成本计划更是这样。也有一些干部，由于他们官僚主义的作风很严重，对生产状况和各种先进定额盲无所知，心中无数，对新鲜事物熟视无睹，怀疑潜在力量的存在，总想维持现状，怕提高了计划完不成，要受上级批评，因此所定计划，年年都是处在落后的状态。也还有个别的人，品质不良，为了个人不正当的目的，故意压低计划，虚报成本，以便不费多大力气就可以完成和超过计划，骗取国家奖金，赚得个人名誉地位。因此，在制定今年生产计划时，我们必须与上述各种错误的思想和作风进行坚决的斗争，揭发、批判保守思想和官僚主义，并处罚那些虚报成本、故意压低计划、欺骗国家的分子。这样才能根据平均的先进技术经济定额，经过精确的计算，制定正确的先进的生产计划。
    正确地制定计划，必需按照需要与可能的原则，克服盲目性。今天我们有少数产品，例如：火柴、麻袋、纸烟、煤炭等等，生产的数量暂时超过了人民群众目前的需要和购买能力，如果还要增产，就势必造成积压，同样会使国家在经济上造成损失。因此，对这样一些产品，目前不是增加产量，而应努力提高质量，降低成本。我们的许多国营企业部门，不仅在基本建设方面存在着盲目性，在生产上同样也存在着不同程度的盲目性，例如生产数量和品种与社会的需要脱节、不计算需要盲目增加工人和技术设备等等，都是盲目性的表现。因此，在反对保守思想的同时，也必须注意防止和克服盲目增产的偏向。
    正确地制定计划，必须贯彻全面的计划观点。这就是说，不仅要考虑产品的数量，而且应同时考虑产品的品种、质量、成本和资金的周转。我们有一些厂矿，在制定计划时只注意产量的计划，只着眼于总产值是否有所提高，但对于产品品种和质量的计划却重视不够，对于成本计划、财务计划与劳动计划则注意更差。因此就造成计划中的片面性，并在执行计划时产生严重的不合理现象。如有的厂矿多数产品虽完成了甚至超过了计划，也完成了生产总值的数字，但某些主要的产品却没有完成计划；有的厂矿完成了产量计划，但没有完成质量计划，或没有完成成本与财务计划。有的甚至产量越多，废品和次品也越多，成本越高，给国家造成了很大的损失。这种局部地也就是片面地制定和执行计划所造成的恶果，不仅浪费很大，不能真正完成国家所给予的计划任务，而且影响企业中领导水平的提高和工作的改善。因此，工业生产部门在制定计划时，必须教育干部树立全面的计划观点，把完成产量和提高质量、降低成本从思想上统一起来，防止和克服只顾数量不问质量、只顾生产不计成本的想法和作法，并切实制定产品、劳动、材料供应、财务、成本等计划，在执行中予以贯彻，以便使我们的工业产品真正做到“又多、又好、又便宜”。
    这里应该着重指出：有了计划，并不是说就已经完成了计划的编制工作，更不是说计划就一定能够实现。任何计划，毫无例外地必须经过职工自觉的、积极的行动，才能保证其实现。因此，发动职工充分和广泛地讨论计划，是制定和贯彻计划必不可少的一个步骤。已往的经验证明：计划经过了职工的讨论，就可以避免和克服保守思想或冒险倾向。职工的讨论特别对于纠正保守倾向有很大的作用。同时也只有经过职工的讨论才能使计划变成领导与群众相结合的计划，使全体职工发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为完成计划而努力劳动。那种不发动群众讨论计划、以为编制企业计划只是少数领导干部或计划部门的责任的想法和作法，显然是错误的，而且是决不能把计划做好的。
    发动厂矿全体职工讨论计划，决不是形式主义地向群众宣布一下和举手通过一下就完事的，除了向职工宣传计划的意义、本单位的具体任务以及完成计划的有利条件和不利条件以及各种措施以外，应当有足够的时间让群众酝酿讨论。首先应该讨论怎样充分挖掘企业的潜在力，寻找生产中的关键问题，发现薄弱环节，以及研究解决的办法，这样才能使讨论计划与群众性的找窍门运动和合理化建议结合起来，充分发挥群众的智慧，推动生产前进。在讨论中，那种认为“潜力挖光”、“窍门找绝”的想法应当受到批判和纠正。其次，结合讨论计划，厂矿的各级领导人员应很好总结和推广生产中各种先进经验，并抓住其中主要的经验，结合生产中当前存在的问题，集中地予以推广。再次，根据国家计划的生产指标而拟定的厂矿计划，要成为全体职工的实际行动，还应该制定车间、小组或个人的计划，使每个职工都有具体的奋斗目标。这种车间、小组和个人的计划，最好通过小组或个人的爱国公约来制定。同时在这个基础上，订立联系合同，以便使各车间、各小组及个人计划有所配合和联系。最后，在讨论计划的时候，应该采用集体合同的形式，解决安全生产和福利问题，借以教育职工认识个人利益与国家利益完全一致的道理。
    发动职工群众讨论计划，是政治工作与经济工作相结合的具体表现。应该通过这种讨论，加强对职工群众的政治教育工作，同时解决生产中的重要问题。沈阳五三厂思想教育工作的成功经验，同样应该具体运用到发动群众讨论计划的工作中去。一九五三年是执行国家五年建设计划的第一年，我们的事业应该有一个良好的开端。正确地制定计划，正是这个良好开端的首要环节。如果我们有一个正确而实际的计划，又能不断地检查计划的执行情况，推广执行和完成计划的良好经验，修正计划中某些缺点和错误，那么，在全体职工努力之下，一九五三年的工业生产计划是一定可以胜利完成和超过的。
