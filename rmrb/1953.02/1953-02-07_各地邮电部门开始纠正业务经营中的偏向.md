Post and Telecommunications Departments in Various Regions Begin to Correct Deviations in Business Operations

A movement to examine and correct errors and deviations such as bureaucracy and coercion in business operations has begun in post and telecommunications departments across the country.

After discovering serious deviations in the business operations of post and telecommunications departments in various regions, the Central Ministry of Post and Telecommunications issued instructions in late November last year to correct these deviations. However, post and telecommunications departments in various regions generally did not pay enough attention to these instructions. Although some places convened provincial post and telecommunications bureau chief meetings, specifically arranging the work of correcting deviations, the effort was not thorough enough and did not fundamentally resolve the problem ideologically, so the deviations were not corrected. Some places only transmitted the instructions and did not seriously conduct inspections. Some responsible officials in provincial and municipal post and telecommunications departments even mistakenly believed that deviations were only individual cases, and even if they existed, they had already been corrected. These erroneous attitudes prevented the instructions of the Central Ministry of Post and Telecommunications from being truly implemented. To this end, the Central Ministry of Post and Telecommunications decided to make correcting deviations the central task for the first quarter of this year, and in mid-January, it transferred more than fifty cadres, forming seven work groups, to the major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, Central South, Southwest, Northwest, and the provinces of Hebei and Shanxi, to assist various regions in carrying out the work of correcting deviations. At present, the work of correcting deviations in post and telecommunications departments has gradually started at the provincial and municipal levels. Some places, such as Hebei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi provinces, have delved into county or even lower-level institutions. In the inspection process, various regions have continued to uncover many new problems, which have initially improved the understanding of the broad masses of employees. Some employees in the Northeast post and telecommunications departments said, "Now we understand right and wrong, and we also know where we should direct our efforts."

The tasks in many places show that whether the work of correcting deviations can be carried out smoothly mainly depends on whether leading cadres at all levels attach importance to it, take the lead actively, promote democracy, and conscientiously inspect and implement. However, until now, some leading cadres in some provinces and cities, especially responsible cadres in post and telecommunications bureaus (such as Tianjin) who consider that they have completed their tasks well in the past, still lack sufficient understanding of the seriousness of deviations, and still have, to varying degrees, a blindly complacent attitude, and do not earnestly mobilize the masses to carry out inspections. This attitude cannot be tolerated. (Ma Ran)

    各地邮电部门开始纠正业务经营中的偏向
    全国各地邮电部门检查业务经营中的官僚主义和强迫命令等错误和偏向的运动已经开始。
    中央邮电部发现了各地邮电部门在业务经营中的严重偏向后，曾于去年十一月下旬发出纠正偏向的指示。但各地邮电部门对这一指示一般仍不够重视。有些地方虽然召开了全省邮电局局长会议，专门布置了纠正偏向的工作，但进行得很不深入，没有从思想上彻底解决问题，以致偏向仍未纠正。有些地方仅把指示传达了一下，根本没有认真地进行检查。有些省市邮电部门的负责人还错误地认为偏向只是个别的，即使有也已经纠正了。这些错误的态度使得中央邮电部的指示没有真正贯彻下去。为此中央邮电部决定把纠正偏向作为今年第一季度的中心任务，并于一月中旬抽调了五十多个干部，组成七个工作组，分赴东北、华东、中南、西南、西北各大行政区及河北、山西等省，协助各地进行纠正偏向的工作。目前邮电部门的纠正偏向工作已在省市一级逐渐开展起来，有些地方如河北、四川、江西、陕西等省已深入到县或更下层的机构中去，各地在检查中继续揭发了很多新的问题，已初步提高了广大职工的认识。东北邮电部门有些职工就说：“现在我们明白是非了，也知道劲儿应该向那里使了。”
    很多地方的任务表明，纠正偏向这一工作能否顺利开展，主要决定于各级领导干部是否重视起来，并积极带头，发扬民主，认真检查和贯彻。但是，直到现在，还有些省、市的领导干部，特别是自认为过去完成任务比较好的邮电局（如天津）的负责干部，对偏向的严重性还缺乏足够的认识，还或多或少地存在着盲目自满的情绪，不认真发动群众开展检查。这种态度是不能容许者。  （马然）
