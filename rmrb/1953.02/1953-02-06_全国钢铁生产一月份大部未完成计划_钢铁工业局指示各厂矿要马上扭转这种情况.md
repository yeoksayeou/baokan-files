    [This report] National Steel Production Mostly Failed to Meet January Plan
    Steel Industry Bureau Instructs All Factories and Mines to Immediately Reverse This Situation

    [This newspaper reported] According to the national steel industry's production plan in January, the situation was not very good. The Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry specially instructed all its subordinate factories and mines to quickly reverse this situation.

    According to statistics of production daily reports (ending January 31) received by the Steel Industry Bureau from various factories and mines, the national steel industry's production in January, except for steel ingot production which completed 108.5% of the plan (among which, electric furnace and converter steelmaking also failed to complete the plan), iron (rich) ore only completed 98.5%, pig iron completed 95.3%, steel completed 95.4% (among which, the East China region was the worst, only completing 57.4%), and coke completed 96.8%. From the perspective of factories and mines, except for Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Shijiazhuang Coke Plant, Shanghai Asia Steel Plant, Shandong Liguo Iron Mine, and Qijiang Iron Mine, all factories and mines failed to complete the planned tasks for major products, among which Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Chongqing 101 Plant completed the worst. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's pig iron only completed 75.4% of the plan, Chongqing 101 Plant's pig iron only completed 92.6% of the plan, steel ingot (open hearth) completed 71%, and steel completed 93.4%.

    The main reason for the failure to complete the production plan is that the leading cadres of various factories and mines have not established the concept of "evenly and rhythmically completing the plan." Production is often loose at the beginning and tight at the end. When various factories and mines make rush efforts at the end of the year, they cannot take into account safe production or equipment maintenance, resulting in frequent accidents and increased waste products, causing great losses to the country. For example, the blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had an accident at the end of last year, and it could not supply pig iron for steelmaking, forcing the Martin furnace to be repaired ahead of schedule. As a result, the production plans for steel ingots and steel were not completed. In addition, some units, such as the factories in East China, took the implementation of the eight-grade wage system as the central task, and the leading cadres relaxed their leadership over production. As a result, the production of steel in the region only completed 58.1% of the task.

    In order to change the above situation, the Central Steel Industry Bureau specially instructed its subordinate sub-bureaus, companies, and factories and mines, pointing out that the situation in January, where most steel production factories and mines failed to complete the plan, is very serious. If this situation is not quickly reversed, February only has twenty-eight days, and it is also the Spring Festival, then there is still a great danger of not completing the plan. Therefore, it must arouse the serious attention of various factories and mines, and take the following effective measures:

    1.  Quickly organize inspections, combine with the discussions of the staff and workers on this year's production plan, and formulate specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. The leading cadres of each unit must educate the staff and workers, especially the cadres, that "the plan is the active law of the state," so that everyone establishes the concept that the national plan must be completed, and conduct timely rewards and punishments, strictly implement the responsibility system, and completely overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible.

    2.  We must organize rhythmic and balanced production. Various factories and mines must strengthen production technology management and production scheduling, and formulate and implement production operation plans and production instruction charts. Each factory, mine, and workshop should complete the plan on a daily basis according to variety and quality indicators; the planning departments and production technology departments of each enterprise must check the completion of the plan on a daily basis in order to supervise and guarantee the realization of the plan.

    3.  Implement safe production. Various factories and mines should promptly check the maintenance of equipment and repair equipment, strictly prevent accidents, and at the same time pay attention to strengthening labor protection. When accidents occur, the responsibility for the accident should be investigated, and the derelict personnel should be punished.

    全国钢铁生产一月份大部未完成计划
    钢铁工业局指示各厂矿要马上扭转这种情况
    【本报讯】全国钢铁工业一月份完成生产计划情况不很好，中央重工业部钢铁工业局特指示所属各厂矿迅速扭转这一情况。
    据钢铁工业局收到的各厂矿的生产日报（至一月三十一日止）统计，全国钢铁工业一月份的生产，除钢锭产量完成计划百分之一零八点五（其中电炉，转炉炼钢也未完成）外，铁（富）矿仅完成百分之九十八点五，生铁完成百分之九十五点三，钢材完成百分之九十五点四（其中华东区最差，只完成百分之五十七点四），焦炭完成百分之九十六点八。从厂矿方面来看，除天津钢厂、唐山钢厂、石家庄焦厂、上海亚细亚钢铁厂、山东利国铁矿和綦江铁矿外，所有厂矿都没有完成主要产品的计划任务，其中以太原钢铁厂和重庆一零一厂完成得最差。太原钢铁厂的生铁仅完成计划的百分之七十五点四，重庆一零一厂的生铁仅完成计划的百分之九十二点六，钢锭（平炉）完成百分之七十一，钢材完成百分之九十三点四。
    生产计划没有完成的主要原因，是各厂矿领导干部没有树立“均衡地节奏地完成计划”的观念。生产往往是前松后紧。各厂矿在年底突击任务时，便顾不了安全生产，顾不了检修设备，以致常出事故，废品增多，给国家造成很大损失。例如，太原钢铁厂的高炉在去年年底出了事故，便不能供给炼钢以生铁，迫使提前检修马丁炉，结果，钢锭、钢材的生产计划都没有完成。此外，有些单位，如华东区各厂以推行八级工资制为中心工作，领导干部放松了对生产的领导，因之该区钢材的生产只完成任务的百分之五十八点一。
    为了改变以上情况，中央钢铁工业局特指示所属各分局、公司和厂矿，指出一月份钢铁生产大部分厂矿没有完成计划的情况是十分严重的，如不迅速扭转这种情况，二月份只有二十八天，又值春节，则仍有完不成计划的很大危险，所以必须引起各厂矿的严重注意，并采取下列有效措施：
    一、迅速组织检查，结合职工群众讨论今年生产计划的工作，作出保证完成计划的具体措施。各单位的领导干部要对职工，特别是干部，进行“计划就是国家积极的法律”的教育，使每一个人都树立起必须完成国家计划的观念，并及时地进行奖惩，严格贯彻责任制，彻底克服无人负责的现象。
    二、必须组织有节奏的均衡的生产。各厂矿必须加强生产技术管理与生产的调度工作，制订与贯彻生产作业计划及生产指示图表制。每一厂矿、车间，都应做到按日按品种及质量指标完成计划；各企业计划部门和生产技术部门必须按日检查计划的完成情况，以便监督和保证计划的实现。
    三、贯彻安全生产。各厂矿应及时检查设备维护情况与检修设备，严防发生事故，同时注意加强劳动保护，发生事故时，应追究事故责任，处分失职人员。
