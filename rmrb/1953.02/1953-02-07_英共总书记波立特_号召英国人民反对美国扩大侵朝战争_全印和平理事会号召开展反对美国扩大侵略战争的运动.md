Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 6th: The London "Daily Worker" of February 3rd published a statement made this week by Harry Pollitt on behalf of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party. The statement warned that Eisenhower's State of the Union address showed "the increasing danger of the United States expanding its war policy in the Far East."

Eisenhower's plan to instruct Chiang Kai-shek to attack China from Taiwan "will be the first action to implement the adventurous foreign policy of aggression against socialism in the name of 'liberation' announced by the new US Secretary of State Dulles. At a time when the number of American deserters in Korea has reached an unprecedented level for any other army, the US government is planning a new offensive in Korea, causing heavy losses to Britain."

The statement demanded that Churchill must tell Parliament the content of his secret talks with Eisenhower and Dulles.

The statement called on the British people to send telegrams and resolutions to members of Parliament, forcing the government to give Eisenhower an ultimatum, declaring:

One: Under no circumstances will Britain support any form of war against the People's China.

Two: Britain will immediately withdraw all its troops in Korea; demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea, repatriation of all prisoners of war, and under no circumstances will Britain participate in a new offensive.

Three: Unconditionally oppose Dulles' aggressive foreign policy.

Pollitt mentioned the resolution unanimously passed at the last Morecambe Labour Party annual conference against using British troops to attack the socialist world. He called on the British people to resolutely demand that the British government adopt an independent peaceful foreign policy.

Pollitt's statement concluded: "We demand that Britain withdraw from the (North Atlantic) war pact now, and demand that American troops and planes leave our country immediately. Britain should no longer be so slavish to the Americans, but should take the lead in bringing the five major powers together to conduct peace talks immediately."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 6th: The All-India Peace Council recently called for a campaign throughout India against US President Eisenhower's expansion of the war of aggression.

The Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council has notified the peace committees of various provinces and important peace workers to hold public gatherings and demonstrations to condemn Eisenhower's move to expand the war of aggression in the Far East by announcing the use of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan to harass the Chinese mainland.

The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council is scheduled to meet in New Delhi on February 14th and 15th to formulate plans to expose the aggressive intentions of the US government.

    号召英国人民反对美国扩大侵朝战争
    全印和平理事会号召开展反对美国扩大侵略战争的运动
    【新华社布拉格六日电】二月三日伦敦“工人日报”登载了哈里·波立特代表英国共产党执行委员会在本星期发表的一项声明。声明警告说，艾森豪威尔的国情咨文表明了“美国扩大在远东的战争政策的危险愈来愈大”。
    艾森豪威尔训令蒋介石从台湾攻击中国的计划，“将是实行美国新国务卿杜勒斯宣布的以‘解放’名义对社会主义进行侵略战争的冒险性外交政策的第一个行动。当美国在朝鲜的逃兵之多已达到任何其他军队前所未有的程度的时候，美国政府在计划在朝鲜发动新攻势，使英国蒙受重大损失。”
    声明要求邱吉尔必须把他与艾森豪威尔及杜勒斯的秘密谈话的内容告诉议会。
    声明号召英国人民向议员们发出通电和决议，强迫政府给艾森豪威尔最后通牒，宣布：
    一、不管在何种情况下，英国绝不支持任何形式的对人民中国的战争。
    二、英国将立即撤退它在朝鲜的一切军队；要求在朝鲜立即停战，遣返全部战俘，并且无论在何种情况下，英国绝不参加新的攻势。
    三、无条件反对杜勒斯的侵略的外交政策。
    波立特提到在上次摩尔坎工党年会全体一致通过的反对利用英国军队进攻社会主义世界的决议，他号召英国人民坚决要求英国政府采取独立的和平外交政策。
    波立特的声明最后说：“我们要求英国现在便退出那个（北大西洋）战争公约，要求美国军队及飞机立即离开我们的国土。英国不要再对美国人那样奴颜婢膝，而是要带头促使五大国会聚一堂，立即进行和平谈判。”
    【新华社新德里六日电】全印和平理事会最近号召在全印度展开反对美国总统艾森豪威尔扩大侵略战争的运动。
     全印和平理事会秘书处已通知各省的和平委员会和重要的和平工作者举行公众集会和示威游行，斥责艾森豪威尔宣布要利用台湾国民党残余匪帮窜扰中国大陆以扩大远东侵略战争的举动。
    全印和平理事会常务委员会定于二月十四日和十五日在新德里召开会议，制订揭露美国政府的侵略意图的计划。
