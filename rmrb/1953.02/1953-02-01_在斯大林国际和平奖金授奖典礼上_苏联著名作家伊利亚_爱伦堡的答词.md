    At the Stalin International Peace Prize Award Ceremony
    Speech by Ilya Ehrenburg, Famous Soviet Writer
    The members of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee have awarded me this lofty prize, not so much in recognition of my small contribution to peace, but rather in recognition of the labor, achievements, and sincerity of all Soviet men and women, in recognition of our advanced, deeply humane culture, and the role of the selfless struggle of our people.
    No people in the world cherish peace more than our people. Our people have experienced the deep calamities of war, and they have shed blood to fight for the freedom of mankind. At this moment, which is so important to me, I think of those departed comrades and friends, those who sacrificed their lives to save their motherland and the rights of all honest men and women to peace and human dignity.
    The Soviet people are devoted to peace not only because they know the horror of war. They believe in the justice and power of their ideals. The Soviet Republic announced the policy of "world peace" as soon as it was founded. In our country, no one is tempted by voices advocating blind hatred, praising bombs and bacteria, or calling for destruction and slaughter.
    Our people are devoted to peace not because they fear war, but because they hate war. We have gone through all kinds of tests, and we are not afraid of intimidation. We still remember those days when we were attacked by an army that was considered and indeed was the most powerful at that time. That army had been preparing to attack for many years under the protection and with the help of all the world's robbers. We fought it single-handedly, and we finally won. Only ten years have passed since the historically significant Battle of Stalingrad. The rulers of the United States may have forgotten this, but we have not forgotten, and we are not afraid of their threats. We stand up to defend peace because the victory of our ideals and our aspirations is inextricably linked to the victory of peace. The rulers of the United States are preparing to destroy everything in order to stop the progress of history. We want to protect all children—wherever they live—and we know that, in addition to millions of friends, we have another ally: the future of mankind.
    A Soviet person, no matter what his nationality, is first of all a person who loves his motherland, a true internationalist, an enemy of racial or national discrimination, an active advocate of friendship, and a brave defender of peace.
    When a Soviet person extends his hand, he is not giving orders, nor is he begging for help. It is a hand willing to help, a hand of friendship. Representatives of various countries listen to the speeches of Soviet representatives at various peace conferences because these words are backed by the labor, calmness, and strength of the people of a great country.
    Every Soviet citizen can say with pleasure that he is in favor of the cause of peace. The fate of many of our foreign friends is not like this. I am proud that my name is now listed alongside the names of our friends, my friends: Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Pietro Nenni, Paul Robeson, Yves Farge, Jorge Amado, and other glorious warriors who are currently fighting in the most difficult circumstances to safeguard the happiness of their compatriots and the fraternal friendship of all peoples. At this joyous gathering held in the White Hall of the Kremlin, I think of those advocates of peace who have been lured, persecuted, tortured, and killed by reactionary forces. I want to talk about the dark nights in prisons, interrogations, trials, bloodshed—to talk about the courage of so many of these people. I know that, in talking about these things, I am expressing the thoughts and feelings of all Soviet men and women.
    Not long ago, advocates of peace only included the progressive people of our time. Today, after the Vienna Congress, we have the right to say that all peoples have become advocates of peace. Yes, the peoples of all countries have matured and become stronger. They are defending their own homes, honor, national culture, independence, and security. But without peace there is no independence, without peace there is no security—neither the security of the family nor the security of the country.
    The rulers of the United States are unwilling to listen to the voice of reason. Today, their vicious curses are ringing louder. Their evil actions are becoming more obvious. They are doing all kinds of evil. They are having a nervous breakdown because they have lost hope. Peace is on the offensive, and peace will triumph.
    It is a great honor for me to have the right to wear on my chest the portrait of this person who always leaves a vivid impression in the hearts of all Soviet people and all peace-loving men and women of our generation. When I speak of this great, far-sighted, and upright man, I think of our people: the two cannot be separated. At the same time, our people cannot be separated from the peoples of other countries in the world. It is a great happiness for me to be a soldier in the great army of peace. As long as my heart is still beating, I am determined to fight together with everyone for the friendship of all peoples, for culture, for the future, and against darkness, evil, and war to the end (stormy applause).

### 在斯大林国际和平奖金授奖典礼上  苏联著名作家伊利亚·爱伦堡的答词

    在斯大林国际和平奖金授奖典礼上
    苏联著名作家伊利亚·爱伦堡的答词
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会的委员们授给我这个崇高的奖品，与其说是表彰我对和平的微小贡献，毋宁说是表彰所有苏联男女的劳动、功绩和诚意，表彰我们先进的、带有深刻人道色彩的文化以及我国人民的忘我斗争的作用。
    世界上没有一国人民比我国人民更加珍视和平。我国人民经历过战争的深重灾难，为了争取人类的自由，他们不惜流血。在这个对我说来是如此重要的时刻，我想到了那些逝去了的同志和朋友们，那些为了拯救他们的祖国以及所有正直男女的和平与人类尊严的权利而牺牲了生命的人们。
    苏联人民献身和平不仅是因为他们知道战争的恐怖。他们相信他们的理想的正义性与力量。苏维埃共和国刚一成立就宣布了“世界和平”的政策，在我们国内没有一个人会受到主张盲目仇恨、称颂炸弹和细菌以及号召毁灭和屠杀的声音的诱惑。
    我国人民献身和平，并不是因为他们害怕战争，而是由于他们憎恨战争。我们经过了各种考验，我们是不怕恫吓的。我们还记得我们被一支被认为而当时也确实是最强大的军队进攻的那些日子。那支军队许多年来就在世界上全体强盗们的庇护和帮助下准备着进攻。我们匹马单枪地和它作战，我们终于胜利了。具有历史意义的斯大林格勒战役到今天不过十年。美国统治者或许已经忘记了这件事。可是我们没有忘记，我们不怕他们的威胁。我们站起来保卫和平，是因为我们的理想、我们的愿望的胜利与和平的胜利有着不可分割的联系。美国统治者为了阻止历史前进，正准备摧毁一切。我们要保卫所有的儿童——无论他们住在什么地方——我们知道，我们除了千百万的朋友外，另外还有一个盟友，那就是：人类的未来。
    一个苏维埃人，不论他是哪一个民族，首先他是一个热爱祖国的人，是一个真正的国际主义者，是种族歧视或民族歧视的敌人，是一个积极主张友爱的人，是一个勇敢的和平保卫者。
    当一个苏维埃人伸出他的手来的时候，他并不是发号施令，也不是乞求援助。这是愿意帮助人的手，是友谊的手。各国代表在各种和平会议上倾听苏联代表的讲话，就是因为这些话有着一个伟大国家人民的劳动、镇静和力量做后盾。
    每一个苏联公民都可以尽情地说：他是拥护和平事业的。我们的许多外国朋友的命运却不是这样。我感到骄傲的是，我的名字现在和我们的朋友、我的朋友的名字排在一起。他们是：弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里、彼特罗·南尼、保罗·罗伯逊、伊夫·法奇、豪尔赫·亚马多和其他目前正在最困难的环境中为维护他们同胞的幸福和各国人民的兄弟友谊而进行斗争的光荣战士们。在克里姆林宫白色大厅内所举行的这个欢乐的集会上，我想起了那些被反动势力所利诱、迫害、折磨、杀害的和平拥护者。我要谈到监狱中的黑夜、讯问、审判、流血——谈到许许多多的这些人们的勇敢。我知道：谈到这些，我就表达了所有苏维埃男女的思想和感情。
    不久以前，和平拥护者还只包括我们这个时代的进步人士。今天，在维也纳大会以后，我们有权利说，各国人民都变成了和平拥护者。是的，各国人民已经成熟了，并且变得更加坚强了。他们保卫着他们自己的家，荣誉、民族文化、独立和安全。但是没有和平就没有独立，没有和平就没有安全——无论是家庭的安全还是国家的安全。
    美国的统治者不愿意听理智的声音。今天，他们的恶毒的诅咒响得更厉害了。他们的邪恶的行动变得更加明显了。他们无恶不作。他们的神经错乱了，因为他们已经失去了希望。和平已在展开攻势，和平将要得到胜利。
    我得到能够把这个经常在所有苏联人民心中和我们这一代所有爱好和平的男女心中有着鲜明印象的人的肖像佩带在我胸前的权利，对我说来是极大的光荣。当我讲到这个伟大的、有远见的和正直的人时，我就想到了我们的人民：这两者是不能分开的。同时我们的人民与世界其他各国人民也是不能分开的。我能够成为和平大军中的一名兵士，这是很大的幸福。只要我的心还在跳动，我决心要和大家一起为各国人民的友好，为文化，为将来，与黑暗、邪恶和战争斗争到底（暴风雨般的掌声）。
