Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: On the eve of the Spring Festival, people from all over the motherland wrote letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV), reporting on the large-scale construction of the motherland and wishing the CPV heroes more victories to achieve complete victory in the Korean War. CPV commanders and fighters also wrote letters to the people of the motherland, congratulating them on the Spring Festival and reporting their determination to kill the enemy.

Tens of thousands of construction workers from various places undertaking construction projects sent letters to the Korean front. The entire workforce of the No. 2 Factory construction site of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company wrote: "We are learning from you every moment. After discussing writing to you on February 8, we felt particularly motivated. The Zhuang Huosheng trench road team usually paved 40 square meters of road per day, but on the 8th, they completed 82.4 square meters. The carpentry team also completed 83 square meters of ceiling nailing, a task that would normally require twelve workers, with only four workers." Fang Shanshou and other design engineers from the Design Company of the East China Construction Engineering Department wrote to the CPV, reporting that they are adopting the advanced Soviet experience in design to build the motherland and support the CPV. More than 2,000 construction workers in Xi'an who are undergoing concentrated winter training wrote to the CPV on February 7: "In order to ensure the completion of the great national basic construction tasks in 1953, everyone is very enthusiastic about winter study and decided not to go home for the Spring Festival." More than 200,000 dike-building laborers on the South Dongting Lake construction site in Hunan Province wrote letters to comfort the heroic companies of the CPV. Representatives of the laborers from the old revolutionary base area of Pingjiang County, who participated in the renovation project, said in a letter to the heroic troops of the CPV who were defending Shangganling: "Your heroic fighting spirit has given us greater strength and courage. Our labor efficiency has increased three times compared to the start of the project. More than 90% of the total earthwork task has been completed." All the laborers of the 9th Company of the 11th Brigade of the Yiyang Detachment wrote to the Yang Liandi Hero Company: "We are learning from your spirit of repairing bridges in the rain of bullets. We insisted on clearing the silt in two-meter-deep mud for eleven days in the wind and snow. Many people had their feet pierced and their hands frostbitten, but no one complained. Everyone is determined to repair the dam, protect the motherland's granary, and strive for a greater harvest to support you in winning battles." You Shutang, the father of CPV artilleryman You Hanchun, wrote in the "Patriotic Merit Competition Book" he sent to his son: "I insisted on working in the one-meter-deep Chou Tang Lake to drain silt and won the title of Model of Lake Management. I also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China at the construction site. I guarantee to add merit upon merit, and I will not go home until South Dongting Lake is repaired. I hope you will work hard to kill the enemy on the front line and shoot down more American devils! I am waiting for your good news of meritorious service."

The entire workforce of the No. 2 drilling rig of the No. 3 Drilling Team of the Central South Geological Bureau, who are conducting underground exploration work, wrote to the heroic troops in the Shangganling battle: "We are exploring the underground resources of the motherland in the old revolutionary base area of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the 'Xianggan Border Region.' We have learned the advanced Soviet experience. Now, our drilling speed has exceeded the quota by 11%, and the core recovery rate has also exceeded the quota by 25%. When we encounter difficulties, we ask ourselves, 'Do you remember how the heroes of Shangganling fought?' With this question, the energy comes, and all difficulties are overcome."

Dong Quanzhong, the father of the revolutionary martyr Dong Cunrui, who had just returned from visiting the front line in Korea, wrote to the Chinese People's Volunteers, reporting on the concern of the people of the motherland for them and the construction work of the motherland. He wrote: "You are heroically defending the motherland on the front line in Korea, and I miss you every moment. Whenever the New Year or festivals come, I miss you even more. Everyone in the motherland feels the same as me. Before the New Year, when our delegation returned from Korea, the people of the motherland all said that we were returning to 'report good news,' and they scrambled to ask about the victory news from the front line and your health." He then told the CPV about the vigorous construction in the country. He wrote: "There is a Yongding River in my hometown, but it was never stable before liberation and often flooded. The Kuomintang did it for decades and did not even come up with a plan for repair. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the nation's largest water reservoir for controlling the river, the Guanting Reservoir, has been fully launched after three years of preparation. When I returned to China from Korea this time, I passed through Shenyang, Harbin, Tangshan, Tianjin...many big cities, I saw the factory chimneys as dense as forests, and many of the factories were newly built. I was really happy and told this to my fellow villagers, and everyone's enthusiasm for patriotic production is even higher!" He also reported on the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers: "The lives of the revolutionary military families in the rear are very good. Our delegation held symposiums for the families of revolutionary soldiers in Xuanhua, Shacheng, and Gaoyang in Hebei Province. The families all said: Production and life are not lower than ordinary villagers, and only a few households have some difficulties, and the people's government has also issued 'preferential military grain.' Take my life as an example. Last year, I participated in the mutual aid group, and the crops were well planted. When it was busy with farming, I went to Korea to see you and lived there for four months. During this time, the crops at home were all cultivated by the villagers on my behalf, and it was very good. Now, there are only a few days left before the Spring Festival, and the villagers in our village have organized to paste windows and write couplets for the families of martyrs and soldiers. All the houses and courtyards of the families of martyrs and soldiers have been swept clean. The children's team members and theater troupe members rehearse Yangko, waist drum, and dramas every day, preparing to perform for the families of martyrs and soldiers during the Spring Festival. The villagers also automatically raised a lot of money and bought New Year's goods to give gifts to the families of martyrs and soldiers. They said: It doesn't matter how much the things are, just show your heart!" He concluded by writing: "Dear comrades! The people of the motherland are particularly angry at the unreasonable and expansionist ambitions of US imperialism. Everyone is determined to continue to strengthen the great struggle against US aggression and aid to Korea, and fully support you until the final victory!"

On the eve of the Spring Festival, Wang Hai, a first-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers Air Force, wrote a letter to the people of the motherland to celebrate the Spring Festival. Wang Hai wrote: As the Spring Festival of 1953 is about to arrive, please accept my warmest congratulations. We often think like this: the planes we fly were bought with the money donated by millions of people in the motherland. Every one of our air warriors knows that the people of the motherland are hoping that we will eliminate more American aerial bandits who are slaughtering the Korean people and invading our country's airspace, and defend world peace and the happy lives of the people of the motherland. Thinking of this, our fighting courage in the Korean sky immediately increases. I remember one afternoon, my comrades and I were ordered to attack a group of American aerial bandits. Our planes, like steel knives, plunged into the heart of the enemy's formation in the blink of an eye. Although the enemy planes outnumbered us several times, they were completely messed up by us. Some of the aerial bandits turned around and fled, and some threw their bombs randomly on the beach. In this battle, we shot down a total of five enemy planes and drove away five batches—a total of sixty enemy planes. Our group of young Chinese People's Volunteers Air Force fighters have gone from not knowing how to fight to learning how to fight, from victory to greater victory. To date, I have shot down and wounded nine enemy planes, and my brave aerial comrades have also shot down and wounded many enemy planes. The "air superiority" boasted by the United States can no longer be boasted. We are determined to continue to work hard, constantly improve our combat skills, and fight to the end to defend the large-scale construction of the motherland and defend peace in Asia and the world. If US imperialism dares to expand its war of aggression, we will resolutely respond to it with heavier blows!

    祖国各地人民和志愿军互贺春节
    预祝多打胜仗胜利建设我们伟大的祖国
    据新华社讯：春节前夕，祖国各地人民纷纷给志愿军写信，报告祖国大规模建设的情况，并预祝志愿军英雄们多打胜仗，争取朝鲜战争的完全胜利。志愿军指战员，也写信给祖国人民，祝贺春节，并报告他们的杀敌决心。
    各地成千成万担任建筑工程任务的建筑工人们，写信寄往朝鲜前线。上海钢铁公司第二厂工地的全体工人在信上写着：“我们每时每刻都在向你们学习，二月八日我们在讨论给你们写信以后，劲头就特别大。庄火生沟路小组平时每天铺路四十平方公尺，八日那天就铺好了八十二点四平方公尺。木工小组也以四个人工完成了需要十二个人工钉平顶八十三平方公尺的任务。”华东建筑工程部设计公司设计工程师方山寿等写信给志愿军，报告他们正采用苏联在设计方面的先进经验，建设祖国，支援志愿军。西安市正在集中冬训的两千多名建筑工人，在二月七日写给志愿军的信上说：“为了保证完成一九五三年国家伟大的基本建设任务，大家冬季学习的情绪很高，决定不回家过春节。”湖南省南洞庭湖工地上的二十多万筑堤民工们纷纷写信慰问志愿军的英雄连队。参加整修工程的平江县老革命根据地民工代表，在写给坚守上甘岭的志愿军英雄部队的信上说：“你们的英勇战斗的精神，给了我们以更大的力量和勇气。我们的劳动效率已较开工时提高了三倍。全部土方任务已完成百分之九十以上。”益阳总队第十一大队第九中队全体民工在写给杨连第英雄连的信中说：“我们学习你们在枪林弹雨中抢修桥梁的精神，我们在两公尺深的淤泥中冒着风雪坚持了十一天的清淤工作，许多人脚刺破了，手冻裂了，也没有人叫半个苦字。大家决心要修好大堤，保卫祖国的粮仓，争取更大的丰收，来支援你们打胜仗。”志愿军炮兵游汉春的父亲游树堂在寄给他儿子的“爱国立功竞赛书”上写道：“我在一人深的酬塘湖里坚持排泄淤泥的工作，得了治湖模范的称号。我还在工地上光荣地参加了中国共产党。我保证功上加功，不修好南洞庭湖不回家。我希望你在前线努力杀敌，一炮多打几个美国鬼子！我等着你的立功喜报。”
    正在进行地下勘察工作的中南地质局第三钻探队第二号钻机全体工人们，写信给上甘岭战役中的英雄部队说：“我们正在第二次国内革命战争的老根据地‘湘赣边区’钻探祖国的地下富源。我们已经学会了苏联先进经验。现在，我们的钻进速度已超过定额的百分之十一，岩心收获率也超过定额的百分之二十五。我们遇到困难时，就问自己：‘还记得上甘岭的英雄们是怎样战斗的吗？’这一问，劲头就来了，一切困难就都被这劲头压服了。”
    刚从朝鲜前线慰问归来的革命烈士董存瑞的父亲董全忠，写信给中国人民志愿军，报告祖国人民关怀他们和祖国进行建设工作的情况。他写道：“你们在朝鲜前线英勇地保卫着祖国，我每时每刻都在怀念着。每当过年过节的时候，我就越发想念起你们来。祖国每个人的心，都和我一样。新年前，我们慰问团刚从朝鲜回来时，祖国人民都说我们是
    ‘报喜讯’的回来了，争着打听前线的胜利消息和你们的健康状况。”他接着就把国内蓬蓬勃勃的大建设告诉给志愿军，他写道：“在我的家乡有条永定河，可是在解放前却永不定，常常泛滥成灾。国民党搞了几十年，连个修治的计划也没有订出来。现在在毛主席领导下，根治这河的全国第一大水库——官厅水库，经过三年的准备工作，已经全面动工了。我这次由朝鲜回国时，路过沈阳、哈尔滨、唐山、天津……许多大城市，我看到工厂的大烟囱密得像树林子，其中有许多工厂是新建起来的。真有说不出来的高兴，我把这些告诉给乡亲们，大家爱国生产的劲头更高啦！”他又报道了烈属、军属的生活：“后方的革命军人家属的生活都很好。我们慰问团曾在河北省的宣化、沙城、高阳召开过革命军人家属座谈会，家属们都说：生产和生活都比一般的老乡们不低了，只有个别户有点困难，人民政府还发给了‘优军粮’。就拿我的生活来说吧，去年我参加了互助组，庄稼种得满好。农忙时，我到朝鲜看你们，在你们那里住了四个月。在这一段时间里，家里的庄稼都由村里的老乡们代耕，搞得挺好。现在，离春节没有几天，我们村的老乡们都已组织起来给烈属、军属们糊窗户、写对联，所有烈属、军属的屋里院里都给扫得干干净净。儿童队队员和剧团团员们，天天排演秧歌、腰鼓和话剧，准备春节期间演给烈属、军属们看。老乡们还自动募集了好多款子，买了年货给烈属、军属们送礼。他们说：不在东西多少，表表心意吧！”他最后写道：“亲爱的同志们！祖国人民对美帝国主义的蛮横无理和扩大战争的野心，感到特别愤怒。大家决心继续加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争，全力支援你们，直到最后胜利！”
    中国人民志愿军空军一级战斗英雄王海在春节前夕写信给祖国人民祝贺春节。王海写道：正当一九五三年春节就要到来的时候，请接受我最热烈的祝贺。我们常常这样想：我们驾驶的飞机，是祖国千百万人民捐献的钱买来的。我们每个空中战士都知道：祖国人民在希望我们更多地消灭屠杀朝鲜人民和侵犯我国领空的美国空中强盗，保卫世界和平和祖国人民的幸福生活。想到这里，我们在朝鲜天空中的战斗勇气便立刻增加起来了。记得有一天下午，我和我的战友们奉命去打击一批美国空中强盗。我们的飞机像钢刀一样，一眨眼就插入了敌人机群的心脏。敌机虽然比我们多好几倍，可是被我们打得完全乱了套。空中强盗们有的扭头就逃，有的把炸弹胡乱地扔在沙滩上。这次战斗，我们一共击落了五架敌机，赶跑了五批——共六十架敌机。我们这批年轻的中国人民志愿军空军战士，从不会打仗到学会打仗，从胜利到更大的胜利。到目前为止，我已经击落击伤了九架敌机，我的英勇的空中战友们也击落击伤了许多架敌机。美国吹嘘的“空中优势”再也吹不响了。我们决心继续努力，不断提高战斗本领，为保卫祖国大规模建设，保卫亚洲和世界和平而战斗到底。如果美帝国主义敢于扩大侵略战争，我们就坚决用更沉重的打击来回答它！
