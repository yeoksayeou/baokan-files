Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 27th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political (First) Committee began its work on February 25th. The meeting first discussed the order of the agenda. After the committee unanimously decided to list the Korean issue as the first item on the agenda, Greek representative Kyrou—a loyal lackey of the US State Department known to people at the UN—suggested that the committee list the Greek proposal to slander certain countries' governments for detaining Greek armed forces personnel captured in the Greek civil war as the second item on the agenda. The Greek representative made this suggestion to divert the committee's attention away from truly important issues, especially the Polish delegation's proposal "On Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation." This was very clear.

The head of the Polish delegation, Skrzeszewski, opposed the Greek representative's suggestion and demanded that the Polish delegation's proposal be listed as the second item on the agenda.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, firmly supported the Polish delegation's suggestion.

He said: Mr. Chairman, I speak in support of the suggestion made by my colleague, the head of the Polish delegation. Of course, I am not doing this because the suggestion was made by the Polish delegation. If any other delegation had made such a suggestion, the Soviet delegation would have immediately supported it.

In other words, the Soviet delegation is proceeding from the essence of the matter. Indeed, just reading the fourth and sixth items on the agenda is enough to make everyone understand that when discussing these issues, the sixth item must be discussed first, because the sixth item on the agenda concerns the elimination of the threat of another war and the strengthening of international peace and friendly cooperation. This is the most important issue, and the Political Committee should pay attention to it because this issue involves measures aimed at eliminating the danger of another world war and measures aimed at consolidating world peace—can the Greek representative deny this fact? These measures are a primary task, not only written in our UN Charter but also the main task our organization encounters in its work.

Comparing this agenda item with the fourth agenda item—the proposal to accuse certain countries of not complying with UN General Assembly Resolution 382 A-U, passed on December 1, 1950, and still detaining Greek armed forces personnel—I don’t think it is necessary to present lengthy arguments to demand that the Polish delegation's suggestion be given priority. We only need to simply state that the Greek accusation is a deliberately fabricated accusation—we will prove this with all the facts in our hands during the Political Committee’s discussion of this issue; and we believe that the presentation of this accusation is only to divert the Political Committee’s attention from the truly important issues facing the United Nations. The Soviet delegation is generally opposed to the Political Committee's study of this accusation.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, David, also spoke in support of the Polish proposal, emphasizing the importance of the Polish proposal in the current international situation.

However, the majority of the Political Committee's representatives voted in favor of the Greek representative's suggestion. A total of forty-one delegations participated in the vote, and the result of the vote was: five votes against (the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Poland), and eleven abstentions (Afghanistan, Argentina, Syria, India, Indonesia, and other countries).

Vyshinsky then proposed listing the Polish suggestion as the third item on the agenda.

The majority of the committee rejected the Soviet suggestion. Eight votes in favor (the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries). Thirty-three votes against, and eighteen abstentions (many of whom were representatives of Arab and South American countries).

After this vote, the committee then began to discuss the Korean issue.

US Representative Lodge was the first to speak. He repeated the slanderous remarks that American diplomats often make against China and the Soviet Union, insisting that these two countries should be held responsible for prolonging the Korean War. Lodge, apparently wanting to deliberately sensationalize, cited "ten facts" that, according to him, "undeniably" proved the Soviet Union's "responsibility" for prolonging the Korean War. These so-called "facts" were nothing more than a list of what Lodge claimed were various weapons supplied by the Soviet Union to the North Korean People's Army.

Vyshinsky then spoke. He said: Since we are about to begin discussing the Korean issue, I would like to raise a question before discussing the substance of the issue, a question that I believe is absolutely necessary to raise and is very fair. That is, the question of who will participate in our upcoming discussion of the Korean issue.

Last October, when the Political Committee began studying the Korean issue, the Soviet delegation pointed out that representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should participate in the discussion of this issue. It is very obvious that without the participation of representatives of the Korean people, but with even a representative of the Syngman Rhee government, which claims to represent Korea, participating, this issue cannot be seriously discussed, let alone successfully discussed.

Now we are starting to discuss the Korean issue again.

If everyone studies this issue with a sincere attitude and resolves this issue, if the Political Committee now decides to do so, then it is completely unimaginable to discuss this important issue without the participation of representatives from North Korea, especially since—I want to emphasize—there are Syngman Rhee agents here.

Of course, there is no end to the slander that the American representative is making here against the Korean people, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. The American representative gave a provocative speech, and the provocative attitude he showed in this speech cannot help achieve understanding on any issue. But we will specifically answer him. I fully accept the challenge he shouted to the Soviet Union here, and I am willing to give him a completely satisfactory answer after studying the verbatim record of his speech today. Whether this answer will satisfy him remains to be seen. As for me, I do not intend to ask him any questions, for the simple reason that doing so is completely hopeless. Yes, why ask questions of a mute? He will not give any answers anyway.

No, the Soviet Union does not seem like an ostrich, as Lodge said here, burying its head and thinking that people cannot see it. The Soviet Union acts openly in every place in the name of the Soviet Union. And the United States of America, previously represented by the so-called Democratic government and now by the so-called Republican government, is, as the whole world knows, truly hiding its face with a mask, and using the flag and name of the United Nations as a disguise.

Everyone knows that the intervention in Korea was launched by the US government; everyone knows that the US army and the US government have been conducting a predatory war in Korea for nearly three years. But the US government hypocritically and pretentiously conceals this fact in the name of the United Nations, calling its own army the United Nations army. This is something everyone knows, so of course, there is absolutely no need to ask Lodge any questions about it. We will not hear the truth from him anyway.

But this is not the point of contention at the moment. More on that later. The Soviet delegation now formally proposes that the Political Committee decide to invite the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to send representatives to the committee meeting to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue.

I now remind the members of the committee once again that if the Political Committee rejects such a proposal, it shows that it is unwilling to seriously consider an issue that it verbally acknowledges is very important.

Mr. Chairman, I ask you to put my proposal to a vote.

The American representative, Lodge, who spoke next, could not hide his panic. He merely said hastily that the Soviet delegation's proposal to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the First Committee was not worth discussing, because—you see—North Korea is an "aggressor," and inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is impossible.

Although the American representative insisted on quickly dealing with the Soviet delegation's proposal, the discussion of the proposal to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea took up the entire morning meeting time.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, David, spoke in support of the Soviet proposal, saying: The reason why the work of the General Assembly has not achieved much success until now is undoubtedly mainly due to the US delegation's efforts to prevent the General Assembly from learning the arguments of the other party and from knowing the facts. David emphasized that peace-loving people all over the world sincerely hope to end the bloody tragedy in Korea as quickly as possible.

The head of the Polish delegation, Skrzeszewski, also said that his delegation sincerely supports the Soviet delegation's suggestion. He said: The participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion is very necessary, because only they are representatives of the Korean people who have suffered from American aggression, and only they, who are familiar with the thoughts and feelings of the Korean people who are bravely defending their national independence, can express their attitude towards the suggestions that will be made here.

Indonesian representative Palar spoke twice in support of the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the Political Committee meeting to review the Korean issue. He pointed out that during the Korean armistice negotiations, the United Nations formally recognized North Korea as a belligerent party, and South Korea was also regarded as a belligerent party, and its representatives have been invited to discuss the Korean issue and are now attending the Political Committee meeting. Palar said that therefore, representatives from North Korea must also be invited to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue.

The representative of the Byelorussian Republic, Kiselev, also advocated accepting the Soviet delegation's proposal. He said that the reason why the US delegation and other delegations that support it are unwilling to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is because they do not want the Korean War to end, nor do they want the Korean issue to be resolved fairly.

The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Baranovksy, reminded the committee representatives that the United Nations General Assembly had recently officially submitted to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the suggestions contained in the so-called Indian proposal, and this fact was already tantamount to recognizing that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was a belligerent party in Korea. Baranovksy said that the Ukrainian delegation firmly supports the Soviet suggestion.

The representatives of Greece, Turkey, Peru, Australia, and the United Kingdom opposed inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the Political Committee meeting.

Subsequently, Vyshinsky spoke again.

He said: I think it is necessary to speak again to clarify a point that seems to have been taken as the main reason for opposing the invitation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the First Committee to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. That is: some people here say that it is impossible to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the First Committee because the United Nations has determined that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an "aggressor." The representative of the Indonesian delegation and many other representatives have already raised objections to this statement. In addition to these objections, I would like to draw everyone's attention to an undeniable fact: in essence, the United Nations had already begun negotiations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in December 1952. If you look at the report of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on this issue, you can find in the appendix the original text of the telegram sent by the President of the United Nations General Assembly to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on December 5, 1952.

Here, we have an official telegram issued to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the name of the United Nations General Assembly. What do we find in this telegram? We find that the ninth paragraph of this telegram contains a direct appeal to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, asking it to reply to this telegram. The ninth paragraph says: The President of the General Assembly expects to receive a reply to this telegram as soon as possible, and he himself will report to the General Assembly upon receiving the reply.

I now ask those who oppose inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: If you think it is impossible to negotiate with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Political Committee, then why do you ask it questions and ask it to answer those questions? If you ask questions and wait for answers, then you have already begun negotiations. In this way, you yourselves have refuted the point you raised here that you cannot negotiate with an "aggressor" in the name of the United Nations. No, you can conduct such negotiations, and you did indeed conduct such negotiations!

The second question. Is it true that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is being called an "aggressor" here by the enemies of peace, the creators of war, and the interventionists? I want to remind you that in the very seat of the American representative, former US Secretary of State Acheson once solemnly said that he had a battle map proving that North Korea had attacked South Korea. But until now we have not seen this map, nor does anyone intend to put this map on the table. But I would like to remind you, gentlemen, that as early as two years ago, we produced a map from the Syngman Rhee Command, with arrows, dots, lines, various markings, and symbols indicating the deployment of US and South Korean troops, these troops being the real aggressors who launched the attack. We proved this point, and if necessary, we are willing to prove it again here and add the facts discovered in the past six months. Therefore, the claim that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an "aggressor" is fabricated, unfair, slanderous, and contradicts all established facts.

Vyshinsky said: Next, I want to talk about the issue of the representative of the Australian delegation opposing our suggestion. He began by saying that if the arrival of the North Korean representatives here could ensure the success of the negotiations, then it would be possible to invite them to participate.

Does anyone agree with this point? Why does the Australian representative believe that if the North Korean representatives come here, the negotiations will not be successful anyway? Why does he think that if the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are not invited here, the negotiations will be successful? This is absolutely illogical.

The Soviet representative continued: We express our opinions, but some people say that this is propaganda. British representative Jebb has also been infected with this disease. He also said that this is just propaganda.

I do not object to your propaganda if your propaganda is reasonable, but you oppose the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea coming here for some reason, and you think that this will be unbearable propaganda for you.

You think that once the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea arrive here, this "propaganda" will start immediately, and you will not be able to survive! Is this true?

Vyshinsky pointed out: No forceful reason to oppose the Soviet suggestion to invite the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been presented in the committee.

Vyshinsky finally said: You do not want to end this bloodshed—I say this with confidence, decisively, and firmly, based on many facts and the experience of the past few years—you do not want to end the Korean War. This is the key to understanding the attitude of those who oppose inviting the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The Political Committee then voted on the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation to invite the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the Political Committee to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. Sixteen delegations voted in favor of the Soviet proposal (the Soviet Union, the Ukranian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, Indonesia, Syria, Burma, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yeman and Yugoslavia), six delegations abstained (Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon and Israel), and thirty-five delegations voted against (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Greece, Turkey and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization).

At the committee's afternoon meeting on the 25th, no one requested to speak on the Korean issue, and the meeting was adjourned.

The Political Committee was originally scheduled to meet on the morning of the 26th, but it did not meet because no one requested to speak.

### 联大政委会二十五日会议上  维辛斯基驳斥了美国代表洛奇的荒谬论据

    联大政委会二十五日会议上
    维辛斯基驳斥了美国代表洛奇的荒谬论据
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日电：联合国大会政治（第一）委员会在二月二十五日开始工作。会议首先讨论议程次序问题。在委员会一致决定把朝鲜问题列为第一项议程后，希腊代表基罗——联合国人士都知道的美国国务院的忠实走狗——建议委员会把希腊诽谤某些国家政府扣留在希腊内战中被俘的希腊武装部队人员的提案，列为第二项议程。希腊代表所以提出这个建议，目的是要转移委员会的注意力，使它不去注意那些真正重要的问题，特别是波兰代表团提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。这一点是非常清楚的。
    波兰代表团团长斯克热歇夫斯基反对希腊代表的建议，要求把波兰代表团的提案列为第二项议程。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部部长维辛斯基坚决支持波兰代表团的建议。
    他说：主席先生，我发言支持我的同事波兰代表团团长提出的建议。当然，我这样做并不是因为这个建议是波兰代表团提出的。假如任何其它代表团提出这样一个建议，苏联代表团也要马上支持它。
    换句话说，苏联代表团是从问题的本质出发的。的确，只要读一读议程的第四项和第六项，就能够使所有的人明白：在讨论这些问题的时候，必须优先讨论第六项，因为第六项议程是关于消除另一次战争的威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的问题。这是一个最重要的问题，政治委员会应该予以注意，因为这个问题涉及目的在于消除另一次世界大战危险的措施以及目的在于巩固世界和平的措施——希腊代表能够否认这个事实吗？这些措施是一个首要的任务，不仅写在我们的联合国宪章上，而且是我们的组织在工作中所遇到的主要任务。
    把这一项议程与第四项议程——控诉某些国家不遵守联合国大会于一九五零年十二月一日通过的第三百八十二号A—U项决议仍然扣留希腊武装部队人员的提案——比较一下。我认为不需要提出长篇论据来要求给波兰代表团的建议以优先讨论权。我们只要简单地说明：希腊的控诉是故意捏造出来的控诉——我们将在政治委员会讨论这个问题的过程中，以我们手中掌握的一切事实来证明这一点；而且我们认为提出这个控诉只是要转移政治委员会对联合国面临的真正重要问题的注意。苏联代表团大体上是反对政治委员会研究这个控诉的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维也发言支持波兰的建议，他强调波兰建议在目前国际局势中的重要性。
    但是，政治委员会的大多数代表投票支持希腊代表的建议。共有四十一个代表团参加表决，表决的结果是：五票反对（苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰），十一票弃权（阿富汗、阿根廷、叙利亚、印度、印度尼西亚及其他国家）。
    维辛斯基随即提议把波兰建议列为第三项议程。
    委员会的多数拒绝了苏联的建议。八票赞成（苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰及其他国家）。三十三票反对，十八票弃权（其中很多是阿拉伯及南美国家的代表）。
    委员会在这次表决之后，接着便开始讨论朝鲜问题。
    美国代表洛奇第一个发言。他重复美国外交家经常诽谤中国和苏联的言论，硬说这两国应负拖延朝鲜战争的责任。洛奇显然想故意耸人听闻，他举出了“十个事实”，照他说是“无可否认地”证明了苏联应负拖延朝鲜战争的“责任”的。这些所谓“事实”，不过是列举了洛奇所谓苏联供给北朝鲜人民军以各种各样的武器而已。
    维辛斯基接着发言。他说：由于我们将要开始讨论朝鲜问题，所以我希望在还没有讨论这个问题的实质之前提出一个问题，这个问题在我看来是绝对有必要提出的，并且是十分公正的，这就是什么人参加我们将要进行的关于朝鲜问题的讨论的问题。
    去年十月，当政治委员会开始研究朝鲜问题的时候，苏联代表团曾指出：在讨论这个问题的时候，应该要有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加。十分明显，如果没有朝鲜人民代表参加会议，却甚至有一个自称代表朝鲜的李承晚政府的代表参加，那就不能对这个问题进行认真的讨论，更不能进行成功的讨论。
    现在我们又开始讨论朝鲜问题了。
    如果大家以真诚的态度来研究这个问题，解决这个问题，如果政治委员会现在决定要这样做，那就完全不能想像在讨论这个重要问题时没有北朝鲜代表参加，特别是由于——我要强调——现在有李承晚代理人在此。
    当然，像现在美国代表在这里向朝鲜人民、中华人民共和国和苏联进行的那样的诽谤是没有止境的，美国代表发表了挑衅性的演说，他在这篇演说中表现的挑衅的态度是不能有助于在任何问题上获得谅解的。但是我们将要专门答复他我完全接受他在这里吵吵嚷嚷地向苏联提出的挑战，并且愿意在研究了他今天发言的速记记录之后给他完全满意的答复。我给他的这个答复是否能使他满意有待将来证明。在我这方面来说，我不打算向他提出任何问题，理由很简单：这样做是完全没有希望的。是的，何必向哑巴提问题呢？他反正是不会给予任何答复的。
    不，苏联并不像洛奇在这里所说的那样好像一个鸵鸟，把头藏起来，便以为人家看不见它了。苏联在每一个地方都是公开地以苏联的名义采取行动的。而以前由所谓民主党政府、现在由所谓共和党政府代表的美利坚合众国，正如全世界都知道的，才是真正用一个假面具把它的面孔藏起来的，而利用联合国的旗子与名义作为伪装的。
    大家知道，对朝鲜的干涉是美国政府发动的；大家知道，美国军队和美国政府在朝鲜进行掠夺性的战争差不多近三年了。但是美国政府却伪善地、假惺惺地用联合国的名义把这个事实掩盖起来，把它自己的军队称为联合国军。这是大家都知道的事情，因此当然完全没有必要在这方面向洛奇提出任何问题。我们反正不会从他那里听到事情的真相的。
    但是这不是目前的争论点所在。这一点到以后再说。苏联代表团现在正式提议政治委员会决定邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国派代表出席委员会会议以便参加朝鲜问题的讨论。
    我现在再一次提醒委员会的各位委员，政治委员会如果拒绝这样一个提议，那就表明它不愿意认真考虑它口头也承认是很重要的一个问题。
    主席先生，我请你把我的提议付诸表决。
    接着发言的美国代表洛奇无法掩饰他的慌乱。他仅仅草草地说，苏联代表团邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表出席第一委员会的提案是不值得讨论的，因为——你们看——北朝鲜是一个“侵略者”，邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表是办不到的。
    虽然美国代表坚持迅速处理苏联代表团的提议，但是邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的提议的讨论还是占据了整个上午会议时间。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维发言支持苏联的提议，他说：大会工作之所以直到现在还没有什么成就，主要无疑是由于美国代表团极力阻止大会获悉另外一方的论据，不让大会知道事实。戴维着重指出：全世界爱好和平的人民诚恳地希望最迅速地结束朝鲜的流血惨剧。
    波兰代表团团长斯克热歇夫斯基也说：他的代表团诚恳地支持苏联代表团的建议。他说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论是非常必要的，因为只有他们才是身受美国侵略之害的朝鲜人民的代表，只有他们这些熟悉英勇地保卫本国独立的朝鲜人民的思想感情的人，才能对将在此地提出的建议表明他们的态度。
    印度尼西亚代表巴拉两次发言，支持苏联提出的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表出席政治委员会会议，审议朝鲜问题的提议。他指出：在朝鲜停战谈判期间，联合国正式承认北朝鲜为交战一方，南朝鲜也被看做交战一方，它的代表已被邀请来讨论朝鲜问题，现在也出席了政治委员会的会议。巴拉说，因此，也必须邀请北朝鲜的代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论。
    白俄罗斯共和国代表基谢列夫，也主张接受苏联代表团的提议。他说：美国代表团和支持它的其他代表团之所以不愿意邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表，是因为它们并不希望朝鲜战争结束，也不希望朝鲜问题得到公正解决。
    乌克兰共和国代表巴拉诺夫斯基提醒委员会代表说：联合国大会曾在不久以前把包括在所谓印度提案中的建议正式向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出，这个事实就已经等于承认朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是朝鲜的交战一方了。巴拉诺夫斯基说，乌克兰代表团坚决支持苏联的建议。
    希腊、土耳其，秘鲁、澳大利亚和英国的代表反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加政治委员会的会议。
    随后，维辛斯基再次发言。
    他说：我认为有必要再次发言来澄清一点，这一点似乎已被人当作反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席第一委员会参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论的主要理由了。这一点就是：有人在这里说，邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席第一委员会是不可能的，因为联合国已经认定朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是“侵略者”了。印度尼西亚代表团的代表和其他许多代表已经对这种说法提出了反对的意见，除了这些反对意见以外，我愿意提请大家注意这样一个不可争辩的事实，就是：从实质上讲，在一九五二年十二月联合国便已经和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国开始谈判了。如果你们看一看联合国大会主席所提出的关于这一问题的报告，你们便可以发现，在附录中有联合国大会主席于一九五二年十二月五日致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相和致中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长的电报的原文。
    这里，我们就有一篇以联合国大会的名义向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发出的正式电报。我们在这电报里找到了什么呢？我们发现在这电报的第九段中包含着对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的直接呼吁，要求它答复这个电报。第九段说：大会主席期待这电报尽早获得答复，他本人在收到答复的时候要向大会报告。
    我现在问那些反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的人们：假如你们认为不可能在政治委员会中与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府商谈，那么你们又为什么向它提出问题并要求它答复那些问题呢？假如你们提出了问题并等候答复，那末你们就是已经开始谈判了。这样，你们自己就已经驳倒了你们在这里所提出来的所谓你们不能以联合国的名义与一个“侵略者”谈判的论点。不，你们是能够进行这种谈判的，而你们的确也进行了这种谈判！
    第二个问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在这里硬是被和平的敌人、战争制造者和干涉主义者叫作
    “侵略者”，这是否符合实情呢？我要提醒你们，就在美国代表目前的席位上，前美国国务卿艾奇逊先生曾经郑重其事地说，他掌握有一份作战地图，证明北朝鲜曾经攻击南朝鲜。但是直到现在我们还没有看到这张地图，也没有人打算把这张地图摆到桌上来。但是我愿意提醒你们，先生们，早在两年以前，我们就已经拿出一张李承晚司令部的地图，上面有箭头，有点子，有线，有各种记号，有表示美国和南朝鲜军队部署情况的符号，这些军队是发动进攻的真正侵略者。我们证明了这一点，假使有
    必要的话，我们还愿意在这里重新证明一次，并且
    把过去半年中发现的事实添进去。因此，所谓朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是“侵略者”的说法是虚构的、不公正的、具有诽谤性的，并且是与一切已肯定的事实相矛盾的。
    维辛斯基说：其次，我要谈谈澳大利亚代表团代表反对我们建议的问题。他一开始就说，假使北朝鲜代表到这里来能使谈判一定得到成功的话，那是可以邀请他们参加的。
    难道有人同意这点吗？为什么澳大利亚代表认为假使北朝鲜代表到这里的话，谈判无论如何不能成功呢？为什么他认为假使不邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表到这里来的话，谈判就能成功呢？这是绝对不合逻辑的。
    苏联代表继续说：我们表示我们的意见，但是有人说这是宣传。英国代表杰伯也是受了这种病的传染。他也说这不过是宣传罢了。
    我不反对你们的宣传，如果你们的宣传是合乎情理的话，但是你们由于某种原因反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表到这里来，你们认为这就会有使你们受不了的宣传。
    你们认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表们一到这里来，这种“宣传”就会立即开始，而你们也就活不成了！这是真的吗？
    维辛斯基指出：对于苏联提议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的建议，在委员会上并没有提出一个有力的反对理由。
    维辛斯基最后说：你们不希望结束这场流血——我根据许多事实和过去几年的经验，充满自信地、断然地、坚决地说这句话——你们不希望结束朝鲜战争。要想了解那些反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表的人的态度，这就是一个关键。
    政治委员会然后便对苏联代表团提出的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席政治委员会参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论的提案进行表决。十六个代表团投票赞成苏联提案（苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、缅甸、埃及、阿富汗、巴基斯坦、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、也门和南斯拉夫），六个代表团弃权（阿根廷、智利、玻利维亚、危地马拉、黎巴嫩和以色列），三十五个代表团投票反对（美国、英国、法国、希腊、土耳其及北大西洋侵略集团的
    其他成员国）。
    在委员会二十五日下午会议上没有人要求就朝鲜问题发言，会议便宣告休会。
    政治委员会原订于二十六日上午开会，也因为没有一个人要求发言而没有开。
