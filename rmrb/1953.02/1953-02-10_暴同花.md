Bao Tonghua
	Qi Ren (painter) Xiang Yi (editor)
	(Adapted from Lin Gang's "A Peasant Family's Tragi-comedy")

	I. Bao Tonghua was from Lushan County, Henan Province. At the age of twenty, she was betrothed by her parents to Zhang Tongting of Ronghe Street as his wife. Her husband suffered from nosebleeds and was not good at labor. Bao Tonghua dared not speak of it, but she was unwilling in her heart.

	II. Bao Tonghua's husband's family had five people: the father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and two younger sisters-in-law. They were all old-fashioned. The mother-in-law was a notoriously fierce person, and she adopted a "suppression" attitude towards her daughter-in-law, constantly finding fault with Bao Tonghua.

	III. Zhang Tongting actually liked Bao Tonghua, but he believed that his wife was bought with money. When he was happy, he would give her a smile, but when he was unhappy, he would hit her a few times, and it didn't amount to much.

	IV. One day, Bao Tonghua went back to her parents' home. Her mother-in-law told her son that she had taken a large package, which must have contained stolen goods. She also said that Bao Tonghua went home to "stir up trouble". The son became enraged and beat his wife with an iron shovel and sticks. Afterwards, he would beat her every ten days or half a month.

	V. Bao Tonghua once thought of running away, but she didn't have the courage, fearing she would lose face for her family. In the second year of her marriage, she hanged herself in the mill, but was fortunately saved by a neighbor. However, her mother-in-law and husband still treated her very badly.

	VI. Bao Tonghua gave birth to a son, which dispelled her thoughts of suicide. The child was named Guanyin (Official Seal). When he grew to be four years old, his father had never held him once, nor had he ever cared about the child's clothing or accessories. Bao Tonghua lived entirely for her child. (To be continued)

    暴同花
    齐仁  画  湘一  编
   （根据林钢所作“一个农家的悲喜剧”改编）
    一、暴同花是河南鲁山县人，二十岁那年，由父母包办嫁给瀼河街张同廷为妻。丈夫有流鼻血的病，劳动也不好。暴同花嘴上不敢说，心里可不愿意。
    二、暴同花的婆家有五口人。公、婆、丈夫和两个小姑子。都是旧脑筋。婆婆是一个有名的厉害人，对待媳妇采取“压服”态度，成天找暴同花的岔子。
    三、张同廷其实也喜欢暴同花，但认为老婆是花钱娶来的，高兴时给她个好脸，不高兴就打几下，也算不了什么。
    四、有一天，暴同花回娘家去。她婆婆对儿子说她拿走了个大包袱，准是偷了东西。她又说暴同花回家去“扯风”。儿子听得上了火，就拿铁锨，杆杖乱打媳妇。后来隔不了十天半月就打一顿。
    五、暴同花曾经想逃跑，但没有胆量，怕丢了娘家的脸。婚后第二年，她关在磨房里上过吊，幸亏被邻居救活了。然而婆婆和丈夫还是对她很不好。
    六、暴同花生了个男孩子，这才打消了寻死的念头。孩子取名官印，长到四岁，做父亲的没有抱过一次，也从来没有管过孩子的穿、戴。暴同花完全为孩子而活着。（未完）
