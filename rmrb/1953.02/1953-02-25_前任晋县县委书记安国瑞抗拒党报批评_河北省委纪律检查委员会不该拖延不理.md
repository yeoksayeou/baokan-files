Editor's Note: Readers Fang Shu and 14 others wrote to criticize the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission for delaying the handling of the incident in which the former Jin County Party Secretary An Guo Rui resisted criticism from the party newspaper by extremely vile means for half a year. This is a problem worthy of attention. The Party's Discipline Inspection Commissions at all levels should use all methods to ensure the development of intra-Party democracy, launch self-criticism and bottom-up criticism. However, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission has failed to attach importance to An Guo Rui's planned anti-Party behavior of resisting criticism, which is obviously wrong. We suggest that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee should promptly supervise the handling of the above-mentioned incident and conduct an in-depth inspection of the work of the Discipline Inspection Commission.

To the Editors: The former Jin County Party Secretary of Hebei Province, An Guo Rui, and others resisted criticism from the party newspaper by extremely vile means. This serious incident has been exposed for half a year, and the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee has also put forward its opinions on how to handle it, but the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission has been delaying the handling of it.

On June 28, 1952, the Hebei Daily published a report by reporter Zhao Zhiguo criticizing the Jin County People's Government for neglecting to lead farmers in eliminating and controlling aphids, which seriously affected cotton production. This criticism was completely correct. However, An Guo Rui flew into a rage upon seeing the newspaper and slammed the table in front of many cadres, saying: "Zhao Zhiguo's criticism of us means he's cutting himself off from Jin County!" Subsequently, he took various vile measures to carry out a series of activities to resist the newspaper's criticism. He instructed the County Production Office to write a letter to the Hebei Daily to slander the reporter's criticism as "fabricating the situation" and being "unrealistic." He also instructed the resident members of the Jin County People's Representative Conference to write a letter of the same content in the name of the Standing Committee to the former Hebei Provincial People's Government Chairman Yang Xiufeng and the Hebei Daily. He also individually mobilized the cadres of the county and instructed the County Production Office to notify all districts that they must also express their attitude and object to the newspaper's criticism. Under the erroneous influence of An Guo Rui, most of the leading cadres in the districts also resisted the newspaper's criticism. For example, some cadres in the Third District even said: "If Zhao Zhiguo comes to our district again, we will eat him alive." A member of the District Committee even went to Beipeng Village to mobilize the masses to oppose the newspaper's criticism.

Zhang Guangxue, the leader of the Central Academy of Sciences' working group stationed in the Beipeng Village weeding and aphid prevention experimental area, was also extremely dissatisfied with this criticism. With the support of An Guo Rui, he went to the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Committee to defend An Guo Rui, saying that Jin County had made great achievements in aphid control. A comrade from the inspection team sent by the Prefectural Commissioner's Office to Jin County cited many facts to prove that the newspaper's criticism was true, but Zhang Guangxue unreasonably said: "Jin County is a key county for aphid prevention and should not be criticized; wouldn't this cause the central government to blame us?" At a meeting of hundreds of party members and the masses held in the Third District on "July 1st," Zhang Guangxue publicly declared that the newspaper's criticism was wrong.

Last August, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee sent people to Jin County for inspection and proved that the newspaper's criticism basically conformed to the actual situation at that time, but An Guo Rui had not yet had a good understanding of his mistake in resisting criticism. According to the inspection results of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee, the Hebei Daily exposed An Guo Rui's series of acts of resisting criticism in the newspaper on September 4 and published an editorial. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee put forward the opinion of giving An a disciplinary warning within the Party and reported it to the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission. However, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission has been delaying a decision and has neither approved nor disagreed with it so far, so that a person like An Guo Rui, who resists criticism, has not yet received the punishment he deserves.

We believe that An Guo Rui's mistake is serious. As the main person in charge of the Jin County Party organization, he regarded Jin County as his own "small kingdom," allowing only praise and not criticism. In his opinion, if someone criticized his mistakes, it would be a violation of his "dignity" and would be courting "ruin." Therefore, when the reporter criticized his mistakes, he became furious, slandered the reporter's correct criticism, and even mobilized party members and the masses to resist the Party newspaper. This was originally not allowed by Party discipline; however, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission actually allowed this kind of event that harmed the interests of the Party to go unheeded, dragging its feet and failing to deal with it so far. We believe that this violates the instruction of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" that "If the criticized person refuses to express his attitude or retaliates against the criticizer, the Party Discipline Inspection Commission should handle it," which is completely wrong.

In the current struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, it is recommended that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission handle this incident in a timely manner, conduct a review of past mistakes, and earnestly correct them in future work so as to promote the smooth development of criticism and self-criticism.

### 前任晋县县委书记安国瑞抗拒党报批评  河北省委纪律检查委员会不该拖延不理

    前任晋县县委书记安国瑞抗拒党报批评
    河北省委纪律检查委员会不该拖延不理
    编者按：读者方舒等十五人来信，批评河北省委纪律检查委员会对前任晋县县委书记安国瑞以极端恶劣的手段抗拒党报批评的事件，拖延半年之久不作处理，这是一个值得重视的问题。各级党的纪律检查委员会应该用一切方法保证发扬党内民主，展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，而河北省委纪律检查委员会对安国瑞有计划地抗拒批评的反党行为竟然不加以重视，这显然是错误的。我们建议河北省委应迅速督促处理上述事件，并对于纪律检查委员会的工作加以深入的检查。
    编辑同志：前任中共河北省晋县县委书记安国瑞等用极端恶劣的手段抗拒党报批评。这一严重事件被揭发已有半年之久，石家庄地委也已提出了处理意见，但中共河北省委纪律检查委员会却一直拖延不处理。
    一九五二年六月二十八日，河北日报发表了记者赵志国的报道，批评晋县人民政府忽视领导农民除治蚜虫，以致严重影响了棉花生产。这个批评是完全正确的。但安国瑞见到报纸后竟大发雷霆，当着好多干部把桌子一拍说：“赵志国批评我们，是自绝于晋县！”随后，他就采取种种恶劣手段，进行了一连串反抗报纸批评的活动。他指使县生产办公室给河北日报社写信诬蔑记者的批评是“捏造情况”、“客里空”，又指使县各界人民代表会驻会委员以常务委员会名义给前任河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席与河北日报写了同样内容的信，并且还个别动员该县干部和指使县生产办公室通知各区也必须表示态度，对报纸批评提出反对意见。在安国瑞的错误影响下，各区大多数的领导干部也抗拒报纸批评。如三区有的干部竟说：“赵志国再来咱区，非把他吃掉不可。”该区一个区委委员还曾到北彭家庄发动群众反对报纸批评。
    驻北彭家庄除草防蚜试验区的中央科学院工作组长张广学对这一批评也极表不满。他在安国瑞的支持下，到石家庄专署和地委替安国瑞辩护，说晋县治蚜工作成绩很大。当场有专署派往晋县去的除虫工作检查组同志举出许多事实证明报纸批评属实，但张广学居然无理地说：“晋县是防蚜重点县，不应当批评；这叫中央看见了岂不责备我们吗？”“七一”那天在三区召开的数百名党员和群众大会上，张广学还当众宣称报纸批评是错误的。
    去年八月，中共石家庄地委派人到晋县检查，又证明报纸批评基本上符合当时实际情况，而安国瑞却对自己抗拒批评的错误一直没有很好认识。河北日报根据石家庄地委检查结果，在九月四日报纸上揭发了安国瑞等一系列的抗拒批评的行为，并发表了社论。石家庄地委提出了给安以党内警告处分的意见，上报河北省委纪律检查委员会。但河北省委纪律检查委员会却一直拖延不决，至今既没有批准，也没有表示不同意，以致使像安国瑞这样抗拒批评的人，至今还没有受到应得的处分。
    我们认为：安国瑞的错误是严重的。他身为晋县党组织的主要负责人，但竟把晋县当成他自己的“小天下”，只许人说好，不许人说坏。在他看来，如果有人批评了他的错误，那就是触犯了他的“尊严”，就是自找“绝路”，因此当着记者批评了他的错误时，他就怒发冲冠，诽谤记者的正确批评，竟发动党内外群众向党报进行抗拒。这原是党纪所不容许的；可是河北省委纪律检查委员会居然对这种损害党的利益的事件听之任之，拖拖拉拉，至今未作处理。我们认为这违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中“如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理”的指示，这是完全错误的。
    在当前反对官僚主义，反对命令主义，反对违法乱纪的斗争中，建议河北省委纪律检查委员会及时处理这一事件，对过去的错误进行检讨，并在今后工作中切实加以改正，以推动批评与自我批评顺利开展。
