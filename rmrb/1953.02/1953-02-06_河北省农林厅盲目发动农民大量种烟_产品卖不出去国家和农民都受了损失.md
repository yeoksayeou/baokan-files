    The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry blindly mobilized farmers to expand tobacco fields last summer. The produced flue-cured tobacco was of low quality and high cost, with no sales outlets, seriously affecting the lives and production of tobacco farmers.
    In 1951, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry mobilized farmers to plant 15,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco, producing 2.25 million jin of tobacco. This flue-cured tobacco was of low quality and high cost, making it impossible to organize exports, and difficult to sell domestically. At that time, the Hebei Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company blindly purchased 700,000 jin at the price of Xuchang tobacco in Henan, but it could not be sold for a long time, resulting in a loss of 12.8 billion yuan. Farmers still had some tobacco in their hands, which could not be sold. In 1952, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry not only did not learn from this lesson, but instead expanded the flue-cured tobacco area to 50,000 mu. On June 3, 1952, the Hebei Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company wrote a written opinion to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, suggesting that they reconsider to avoid repeating the mistakes of 1951, and copied this opinion to the Hebei Provincial Finance and Economic Committee and the China Native Produce Company. On June 7, 1952, the China Native Produce Company wrote a report to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government based on the production of flue-cured tobacco in Hebei Province and the sales of flue-cured tobacco nationwide, suggesting reducing the planting area of flue-cured tobacco in Hebei Province. This opinion was also sent to the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Hebei Provincial Finance and Economic Committee. However, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry still insisted on expanding the area of tobacco planting in the province. In order to expand the planting area of flue-cured tobacco, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry vigorously carried out publicity and mobilization work among farmers, advocating tobacco planting. Local party and government organs in Hebei Province also mobilized agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, village cadres, and activists in mountainous and disaster areas to take the lead in tobacco planting. Local People's Banks, cooperatives, and state-owned coal industry construction materials companies also supported them with loans for planting, fertilizer, coal, and funds. Therefore, the province planted a total of 42,830 mu of flue-cured tobacco, producing a total of 7,888,800 jin (plus 500,000 jin in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, totaling 8,388,800 jin).
    After the flue-cured tobacco from Hebei Province entered the market, the Provincial Finance and Economic Committee and relevant departments conducted research and decided to set the price at 4,200 yuan based on the standard of sixth-grade tobacco. They promoted it at the Second North China Regional Material Exchange Conference held in September last year at this price, but not a single jin was sold. According to a recent survey by the China Tobacco and Hemp Company, the cost of each jin of tobacco in Huairou County, Hebei Province (excluding agricultural profits) is 4,960 yuan (38% higher than the cost of tobacco produced in Xuchang, Henan). If the company purchases it at cost and transports it to Tianjin, adding various expenses, it will cost 8,946 yuan per jin, while the actual selling price in Tianjin is 4,300 yuan, resulting in a loss of 4,646 yuan per jin (excluding operating profits). That is to say, if the state-owned Tobacco and Hemp Company buys all the tobacco, the state will accumulate and lose a huge amount of funds. If the state purchases at a price lower than the farmers' production cost, the farmers will suffer huge losses. Therefore, the flue-cured tobacco in Hebei Province has not been sold to this day.
    Since the tobacco farmers' flue-cured tobacco cannot be sold, they have difficulty eating, clothing, repaying loans, and paying public grain. Some tobacco farmers were forced to sell their cattle to make a living, and some farmers dismantled their curing barns to exchange for food to maintain their lives. Recently, party and government organs, people's congresses, and Hebei Daily and other departments in Hebei Province have received more than 200 letters from the masses demanding a solution to the problem of tobacco sales. Some people in Tongxian Prefecture wrote in their letters:
    "We didn't want to plant (tobacco), but the government repeatedly advocated planting. At that time, we didn't have seeds, so the government lent them to us; we didn't have money to build curing barns, so the bank gave us loans; we didn't have money to buy coal, so the coal construction company lent us coal; the government also allowed us to help sell it. Now we have borrowed money, spent money, and built curing barns. Why can't the tobacco be sold, and the government doesn't care? Our year's hopes have fallen through."
    In order to solve the sales problem of flue-cured tobacco in the province, the Hebei Provincial Finance and Economic Committee has recently convened meetings of the Provincial Cooperative Federation, the Department of Industry, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Company, and the Provincial Local State-Owned Tobacco Factory several times to carefully calculate the cost of tobacco planting and lower the price again to prepare for the purchase of flue-cured tobacco, which will be used in combination by the province's local state-owned tobacco factories. However, all the local state-owned tobacco factories in the province can only use 3 million jin, and the remaining 5 million jin still need to be solved by other methods.
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry should conduct a deep review of the blind expansion of tobacco planting area and find out the lessons. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to accepting the lessons of this matter.

### 河北省农林厅盲目发动农民大量种烟  产品卖不出去国家和农民都受了损失

    河北省农林厅盲目发动农民大量种烟
    产品卖不出去国家和农民都受了损失
    河北省人民政府农林厅在去年夏天盲目发动农民扩大烟田，生产的烤烟质量低，成本高，没有销路，严重地影响了烟农的生活与生产。
    一九五一年，河北省农林厅就发动农民种植烤烟一万五千亩，产烟二百二十五万斤。这些烤烟质量低，成本高，既无法组织出口，国内也不容易销售。当时中国土产公司河北省公司盲目按照河南许昌烤烟价格收购了七十万斤，但长期销售不出，亏损资金一百二十八亿元。农民手里还存着一些烟，也无法销售。一九五二年河北省农林厅不但没有接受这个教训，相反地，竟又把烤烟面积扩大到五万亩。中国土产公司河北省公司曾于一九五二年六月三日给农林厅写了书面意见，建议他们重新加以考虑，以免重蹈一九五一年的覆辙，并把这个意见抄报河北省财政经济委员会及中国土产公司。中国土产公司于一九五二年六月七日根据河北省烤烟生产情况及全国烤烟的销路问题，给中央人民政府农业部写了报告，建议缩小河北省烤烟种植面积。并把这个意见抄致河北省农林厅及河北省财政经济委员会。但河北省农林厅仍然坚持扩大该省种植烤烟的面积。为了扩大烤烟种植面积，河北省农林厅曾经大力向农民进行宣传鼓动工作，倡导种烟。河北省各地党政机关也动员山区和灾区的农业生产合作社、互助组、村干部、积极分子带头种烟。当地人民银行、合作社、国营煤业建筑器材公司也分别以贷种、贷肥、贷煤、贷款等办法加以扶持。因此全省共种植烤烟四万二千八百三十余亩，计产烤烟七百八十八万八千余斤（再加上张家口专区五十万斤，总计八百三十八万八千余斤）。
    河北省烤烟上市后，省财政经济委员会与有关部门作了研究，决定以六级烟为标准，定价四千二百元。他们按照这种价格在去年九月举行的华北区第二届物资交流大会中推销，一斤也没有推销出去。近据中国烟麻公司调查，河北省怀柔县每斤烟的成本（不计农业利润）为四千九百六十元（较河南许昌产烟成本高百分之三十八），如该公司按成本收购运往天津，加上各种费用，合每斤八千九百四十六元，而天津实际销价是四千三百元，每斤要亏蚀四千六百四十六元（不计经营利润）。这就是说，如果国营烟麻公司把烟全部买下，国家将积压和赔蚀巨量资金。如果国家以低于农民生产成本的价格收购，农民将要遭受巨大损失。因此，河北省的烤烟至今仍销售不出去。
    烟农的烤烟既然销售不出去，他们吃饭、穿衣、归还贷款、交纳公粮都发生困难。有的烟农为生活所迫，卖掉耕牛，有的农民拆掉烤房换购粮食维持生活。最近河北省党、政机关，人民代表会以及河北日报等部门，已收到农民群众要求解决烤烟销售问题的函件二百余件。通县专区有的群众来信说：
    “我们不种（烟），政府再三提倡种。当时没种籽，由政府借给；没钱盖烤房，银行贷款；没钱买煤，煤建公司贷给煤；政府还允许帮助出售。现在款也贷了，钱也花了，烤房也盖了，为什么烤烟卖不出去，政府就不管了呢？我们一年的指望落了空。”
    河北省财政经济委员会为了解决该省烤烟的销路问题，最近曾数次召集省合作总社、工业厅、农林厅、省烟酒专卖公司、省地方国营烟厂等部门开会，详细核算植烟成本，再次降低价格准备收购烤烟，由该省地方国营烟厂配搭使用。但该省所有地方国营烟厂仅能使用三百万斤，其余五百多万斤仍然需要用其他方法解决。
    河北省人民政府农林厅对于盲目扩大种烟面积一事应作深刻检讨，找出教训。并望各地注意接受这件事情的教训。
