Reader Letters

Everyone Exposes Bureaucracy

Editor's Note: Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers exposing various evil behaviors of bureaucratic elements. We will publish these reader letters successively to help various localities carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. We hope that readers from all over the country will continue to write letters to expose these issues so that this bad style can be gradually overcome under the supervision of the masses.

Wanxian Special District Cultural and Educational Bureau's Teaching Training Class学员 Exhausted by Frequent Changes of Orders

Editor: Last year, when the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Wanxian Special District, Sichuan Province, summoned active farmers from various counties under its jurisdiction to study in the literacy teaching training class, it changed the gathering time several times, causing the participating farmers to travel back and forth in vain, creating a negative impact.

Last October, the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Wanxian Special District made a long-distance call to the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Wushan County People's Government, saying that students participating in the literacy teaching training class must arrive in Wanxian on October 20th. The Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau immediately gathered people from all the villages, but the Special District called again, saying that the gathering time had been delayed and the people who had already gathered should be mobilized to go home. Soon, the Special District called to notify that they must gather in Wanxian on November 20th to study, and the Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau notified all districts accordingly. However, on November 3rd, the Special District called again, saying that the gathering time should be moved forward, and they must arrive in Wanxian on the 9th. The Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau hurriedly gathered the students in the county on November 6th. But on the 7th, they received another call from the Special District, saying that it had been changed to November 20th to gather in Wanxian, so they had to mobilize the students to return to their villages again.

On November 18th, the Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau gathered the students for the third time, and just as they were about to depart, the Special District called, changing it again to the 23rd to go to Wanxian. The Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau had to mobilize the students to go back again.

The chaotic notification behavior of the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Wanxian Special District has had a very bad impact. This not only caused the students to waste a lot of travel expenses and food expenses, but also wasted a lot of time for the students, seriously delaying production. For example, He Youming from Guantou Township traveled back and forth three times in the rain, walking 360 li, delaying production for nine days. Tan Shunchang, a farmer from Longxi Township, which is very far from the county seat, came to the county twice, traveling back and forth 720 li, delaying production for ten days. And more seriously, the impact on the masses is extremely bad. The masses in various townships had great hopes for those who were going to the Special District to study. Every time they left, the masses warmly sent them off, urging them to learn the literacy teaching method and return to lead the masses in learning. And every time they went to the county and then inexplicably returned, they were all very dissatisfied. Some said:

"The Cultural and Educational Bureau of the Special District doesn't keep its word. People have work in the fields that hasn't been done yet, but they just make people run around." Some said: "After returning, the masses asked us what the literacy teaching method is all about, and we have no way to answer!" Various districts also have many opinions on this. Some district cadres said: "The Cultural and Educational Bureau of the Special District makes a phone call at will, and we can't even keep up with running around to deliver the notices." The Wushan County Cultural and Educational Bureau once used the phone to give opinions to the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the Special District, and the comrade who answered the phone at the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the Special District hung up the phone before the other person finished speaking.

The Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways Lacks Planning in Advance and is Irresponsible Afterwards When Transferring Cadres

Editor: The Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways treats the work of transferring cadres with a bureaucratic attitude, causing the transferred cadres to travel thousands of miles, traveling back and forth in vain, and unable to leave on the way, unable to reach their posts as soon as possible. Now, we expose the facts as follows:

Last year, the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways asked the Personnel Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau to transfer us to work in the ministry, ordering us to report by December 15th. But we didn't receive the notice until December 20th, so we immediately went from the site to Hengyang to gather, and arrived in Beijing on the 25th.

After arriving in Beijing, the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways said that it had been decided to transfer us to the Chongqing Railway Bureau. We asked: The cadres transferred to Chongqing all went directly from Hankou, why didn't the Personnel Bureau tell us earlier? A comrade surnamed Hua from the Personnel Bureau said: "I didn't expect you to come so quickly. When I called Hengyang, I heard that you had already left, so I had to wait for you to come to Beijing before saying so." In fact, communication on the railway is very convenient. Due to the bureaucracy of the Personnel Bureau, we ran an extra 2,400 kilometers, wasting both time and money.

Because we didn't have enough travel expenses, we asked this Comrade Hua to make a phone call to the Hankou Transfer Station, notifying the station to solve the problem of our expenses to Chongqing. She refused, saying: "When you arrive in Hankou, all the problems will be solved by someone." However, after we arrived in Hankou, the comrades at the Hankou Transfer Station said: "The Southwest Engineering Bureau was abolished as early as December 14th last year. The current Hankou Transfer Station belongs to the Chengdu Construction Bureau and cannot pay the travel expenses for cadres of the Chongqing Railway Bureau." We immediately called the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways on the evening of December 31st to report this situation, and on January 3rd this year, we asked the Hankou Sub-bureau to send a telegram again to ask for instructions. But until January 7th, the Personnel Bureau didn't even reply. We watched as there were ships going to Chongqing every day, but because we didn't have travel expenses, we couldn't leave until January 7th.

When in Beijing, Comrade Hua said that the new line was very short of people, hoping that we would not delay and arrive at our posts as soon as possible. We disregarded our fatigue and went south quickly, but unexpectedly we were delayed in Hankou for so long.

We believe that the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways should thoroughly examine this bureaucratic style.

Down to the Countryside, Cadres Eat, Sleep, and Sunbathe, Staying for Three Days Without Being Able to Distinguish Between Hard and Soft Pigsties

Editor: Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent four comrades, Luo Yingjun, Shao Zhanggen, and others, to Daxilu and Qixian townships in Pingyao District, Hangxian County, to understand the situation of animal husbandry work. How did they work?

On the first day, the four comrades went to Daxilu and Qixian townships respectively. After Shao Zhanggen and the other two comrades arrived at the Daxilu Township People's Government, they said to the township cadres: "Today we two want to draw a few forms, we won't go down." Thus, a day passed.

On the second day, the two comrades who worked in Qixian Township also came to Daxilu Township for some unknown reason. The township cadres were busy with the grain requisition work. During the day, the four comrades sunbathed for a whole day. In the evening, they finally went down to the village to work. The four comrades went to two villages respectively to hold meetings. The two comrades who went to a certain village to hold a meeting suddenly withdrew from the meeting halfway through for some urgent matter, and also asked the village cadres to accompany them back to the township government. Thus, another day passed.

On the third day, no one knew what these four comrades did. According to the chairman of the Daxilu Township Farmers' Association, "Anyway, they came for three days, ate for three days, and slept for three days." In the evening, the four comrades talked to the township cadres. They said: "The Provincial People's Government wants us to go back on the 7th, we will leave tomorrow, and we will exchange opinions with you tonight."

The township cadres solemnly came to listen to the opinions of these four comrades.

So, these four comrades spoke. First, they opened their mouths with "Provincial Government" and closed their mouths with "Provincial Government", saying a lot for a long time; finally, they put forward their opinions: "The mud and straw in your pigsties here should be changed frequently, pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and often pick some new mud and straw in."

The township cadres said: "Comrades, we don't understand what you said."

"What! Don't understand? The mud and straw should be changed frequently." The four comrades began to be a little unhappy.

The township cadres said: "Comrades, the pigsties here are all hard pigsties, built with stone slabs or poured with lime, not the kind of soft pigsties you mentioned. Comrades, there is a pigsty next door to the township government, have you seen it?"

This unexpected answer made these four comrades become angry out of shame. They said solemnly: "They are all hard pigsties! ... Well, you don't pay enough attention to animal husbandry work! You don't pay enough attention to it! Provincial Government..." Then they gave a big report to the township cadres. The township cadres were also not convinced, saying: "You pay attention! You stayed here for three days and didn't even know whether the pigsties here are hard or soft!"

Zou Changjie, a Cadre of the Linxiang County People's Bank, Blindly Issued Water Conservancy Loans Without Investigation

Editor: Recently, Comrade Zou Changjie, a cadre of the Linxiang County People's Bank in Hunan Province, did not go deep into the masses to understand the situation, nor did he contact local cadres when issuing water conservancy loans in Tangqiao Township in the fourth district of the county. He blindly issued loans randomly, giving more loans to those who should have less, and giving loans to those who should not have them, resulting in the special funds not being used for their intended purpose and the national loans not playing their due role. For example, the Jinjiachong Pond newly built by the third group of Tudun Village, Tangqiao Township, only needed 1.2 million yuan for all materials, but Comrade Zou Changjie did not calculate the detailed accounts. He only asked the village representative Li Dingan once and issued a loan of 2 million yuan. After receiving the money, Li Dingan kept 400,000 yuan for himself first, and then lent the rest to others. For example, when Zou Changjie issued loans for the Dongchong and Xinbi weirs in Songlin Village, he did not contact the township chief Wang Zhongkui and others beforehand, but blindly lent 1.5 million yuan based on the false plans of Li Gaosheng and Chen Juchuan in the village. As a result, the masses only took out 60,000 yuan to buy a bag of foreign cement, and solved the other weir repair materials by themselves; the remaining 1.44 million yuan of loans were distributed among everyone. There are many such things, which cannot be listed one by one here.

I think: Zou Changjie's bureaucratic style has a very bad impact. This practice seems to be beneficial to the local masses, but in fact it violates the interests of the masses. Because this not only prevents national loans from being rationally used in places where they are needed, which is not conducive to the long-term interests of the broad masses, but also fosters the idea among the local masses that they simply rely on the government and do not actively overcome difficulties with their own strength. Zou Changjie's bureaucratic style, which combines a one-sided mass viewpoint with a lack of in-depth work, is very harmful. It is recommended that the Linxiang County People's Bank criticize him, and it is hoped that comrades in charge of loan issuance work in various places will also prevent this practice. Lan Bo

Main Points of Reader Letters This Week

From January 25th to February 1st, the reader letter group of this newspaper received a total of 1,942 reader letters and 284 letters from various agencies in response to readers.

It can be seen from many letters that the mass struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline is becoming more and more widespread under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government. In eight days, the number of reader letters exposing bureaucratic styles and illegal and disciplinary behaviors has been increasing. The scope of the movement has also gradually expanded and has begun to spread to the political and legal, financial and economic, and cultural and educational systems. In the political and legal system, readers exposed the bad behaviors of some leadership agencies and leading cadres above the county level in suppressing democracy, attacking critics, and shielding and condoning the illegal and disciplinary behaviors of lower-level cadres; in the financial and economic system, readers exposed the erroneous behaviors of some state-owned enterprises and agencies in disregarding rationalization proposals from the masses, violating financial discipline, and wasting state funds, as well as the commandist style of some financial and economic cadres; in the cultural and educational system, readers exposed the bad phenomena of some educational administrative agencies and school leaders disregarding or even suppressing the opinions of the masses, as well as local newspapers neglecting the work of the masses. The recent practices of this newspaper in continuously exposing typical events of bureaucracy and illegal and disciplinary behaviors and supporting the just struggles of the masses have been supported by the broad masses of readers and have also educated and inspired the broad masses of readers. In addition, some individual readers have also reflected in their letters that they still have some ideological concerns when criticizing leading agencies and leading cadres; but with the development of the movement, the number of such letters is decreasing.

In a large number of letters concerning basic construction issues, some of them are expressing opinions on the question of "Should cooperatives be established on basic construction sites?" raised on the "Reader Letter Page" of this newspaper on January 29th. The construction workers, cooperative members, and cooperative students from universities who wrote letters unanimously believed that the view put forward by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives that it is not appropriate to develop cooperative organizations on construction sites is wrong.

专栏：读者来信

    读者来信
    大家都来揭发官僚主义
    编者按：最近本报收到读者很多来信，揭发许多官僚主义分子的各种各样的罪恶行为。我们即将陆续发表这些读者来信，帮助各地开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，希望各地读者继续来信揭发，使这种恶劣作风能够在群众的监督下逐渐克服。
    万县专署文教科朝令夕改教学训练班学员疲于奔命
    编辑同志：四川万县专署文教科去年召集所属各县农民积极分子到专署速成识字教学训练班学习时，数次更改集中时间，使参加学习的农民徒劳往返，造成不良影响。
    去年十月，万县专署文教科打长途电话给巫山县人民政府文教科，说参加速成识字教学训练班的学员必须在十月二十日到达万县。巫山县文教科马上从四乡把人集中，但专署又来电话，说是集中时间延迟了，让把已集中的人动员回家。不久，专署来电话通知，说十一月二十日必须集中到万县学习，巫山县文教科就按此通知各区。可是十一月三日专署又来电话，说是集中时间要提前，九日必须到达万县。巫山县文教科赶紧在十一月六日就把学员集中到县。可是七日又接专署电话，说又改为十一月二十日到万县集中，只好又把学员动员回乡。
    十一月十八日，巫山县文教科第三次把学员集中，正准备出发，专署来电话，又改为二十三日到万县。巫山县文教科只好再动员学员们回去。
    万县专署文教科这种乱下通知的行为，影响很不好。这不但使学员们浪费了不少路费和伙食费，并且还使学员们浪费许多时间，严重耽搁了生产。如官渡乡贺友明冒雨往返三次，走路三百六十里，耽误生产九天。离县城极远的龙溪乡农民谭顺昌来县两次，往返七百二十里，耽误生产十天。而更严重的是，这在群众中造成的影响是极其恶劣的。各乡群众对要到专署去学习的人抱着很大希望，他们每次走时群众都热烈欢送，嘱咐他们学会速成识字的教学后回来领导群众学习。而他们每次到县里后又莫名其妙地回去了，因此都很不满意。有的说：
    “专署文教科说话不算数，人家放着地里的活还没干，可是他们光让人家跑路。”有的说：“回去后群众问我们速成识字法是怎么一回事，我们可没法答复！”各区对此也很有意见，有的区干部说：“专署文教科随便打一个电话，我们跑路送通知都送不过来。”巫山县文教科曾用电话向专署文教科提意见，专署文教科接电话的同志没等别人说完话，就把电话挂了。

    中央铁道部人事局调动干部事先缺乏计划事后不负责任
    编辑同志：铁道部人事局用官僚主义的态度来对待调动干部的工作，使被调动的干部奔走几千里，往返徒劳，并且途中无法动身，不能早日到达工作岗位。现在，我们将事实揭发如下：
    中央铁道部人事局在去年让衡阳铁路局人事处把我们调部工作，限令十二月十五日报到。但是我们得到通知时已经是十二月二十日了，就马上从现场到衡阳集中，二十五日赶到北京。
    到北京后，铁道部人事局说是已决定把我们改调到重庆铁路局了。我们就问：调重庆的干部都是从汉口直接去了，人事局为什么不早些告诉我们呢？人事局一个姓华的同志说：“想不到你们来得这样快。我打电话给衡阳时，听说你们已动身，所以只好等你们来到北京再说。”其实，铁路上的通讯联系是很方便的。由于人事局的官僚主义，我们多跑了二千四百公里路，在时间和经济上都有浪费。
    因为我们带的旅费不够，于是就要求这位华同志打个电话给汉口转运站，通知该站解决我们到重庆去的费用问题。她拒绝了，说：“你们到了汉口，一切问题都有人给解决。”但是，我们到汉口后，汉口转运站的同志说：“西南工程局早在去年十二月十四日就撤销了。现在的汉口转运站是属于成都施工局的，不能代付重庆铁路局干部的旅费。”我们马上在十二月三十一日晚间给铁道部人事局打电话报告这个情况，今年一月三日又请汉口分局打电报再度请示。但直到一月七日，人事局连个回信都没有。我们眼看天天有去重庆的船，但因为没有路费，到一月七日还不能动身。
    在北京时，华同志说新线非常缺人，希望我们不要耽搁，早日到达工作岗位。我们就不顾疲劳，迅速南下，想不到反而在汉口耽搁这么久。
    我们认为：铁道部人事局对这种官僚主义作风应该好好检查一下。

    下乡干部吃饭睡觉晒太阳住了三天硬棚软棚分不清
    编辑同志：最近浙江省农林厅派了罗英俊、邵掌根等四位同志到杭县瓶窑区大六、七贤两乡了解畜牧工作的情况。他们是如何工作的呢？
    第一天，四位同志分往大六、七贤两乡。邵掌根等两位同志到了大六乡人民政府后，向乡干部说：“今天我们两人要画几张表格，不下去啦。”这样一天过去了。
    第二天，到七贤乡工作的两位同志不知为什么也到大六乡来了。乡干部正忙着征粮工作。白天，他们四位同志就晒了一天太阳。晚上，他们总算下村工作了，四位同志分别到两个村去开会。到某村开会的两位同志不知有什么紧急事情，突然中途退会，还要村干部陪送他们回乡政府。这样，又是一天过去了。
    第三天白天，这四位同志做了些什么事，谁也不知道。据大六乡农会主任反映：“反正来了三天，吃了三天，睡了三天觉。”到晚上，四位同志找乡干部们谈话了。他们说：“省人民政府要我们七日回去，明天我们要走，今晚和你们交换下意见。”
    乡干部们都郑重地来听取这四位同志的意见。
    于是，这四位同志发言了。先是开口“省府”、闭口“省府”，说了很久；最后，就提出意见了：“你们这里猪棚的泥和稻草要经常换，要注意清洁卫生，要常常挑些新的泥和稻草进去。”
    乡干部们说：“同志，你们说的，我们不懂。”
    “怎么！不懂？泥和稻草要经常换。”四位同志开始有些不高兴了。
    乡干部说：“同志，我们这里的猪棚都是硬棚，是用石板搭的或者用石灰浇的，没有像你们所说的那种软棚。同志，乡政府隔壁就有一个猪棚，你们看了没有？”
    这意外的回答可使这四位同志恼羞成怒了。他们俨然地说：“都是硬棚！……唔，你们对畜牧工作太不重视了！太不重视了！省府……”接着又对乡干部们作了一个大报告。乡干部也不服气了，说：“你们重视！在这里住了三天，连这里的猪棚是硬棚还是软棚都不知道！”

    临湘县人民银行干部邹常杰不经调查盲目发放水利贷款
    编辑同志：湖南临湘县人民银行干部邹常杰同志最近在该县四区汤桥乡发放水利贷款时，既不深入群众了解情况，又不与当地干部联系，盲目乱发，应少贷的多贷给，不应贷的也贷给，结果使专款不能专用，国家贷款不能起应有的作用。如汤桥乡土墩村三组新建的金家冲塘所需全部器材只要一百二十万元，但邹常杰同志不算细账，只问了村代表李定安一下，就发贷款二百万元。李定安领到款后自己先留用四十万元，其余的钱就分别借给旁人了。又如邹常杰在发放该乡松林村董冲、新壁两座堰的贷款时，事先根本没有和乡长王仲魁等联系过，只听了该村李高胜、陈巨川两个人的假计划，就盲目地贷给一百五十万元。结果群众只拿出六万元买了一包洋灰，其它修堰器材都自行解决了；所余一百四十四万元贷款大家就分着用了。这样的事情还多，这里不能一一列举。
    我认为：邹常杰这种官僚主义作风造成的影响是很不好的。这种做法看起来好像对当地群众是有利的，但实际上却是违反群众利益的。因为这不但使国家贷款不能合理地用到需要的地方，对广大群众的长远利益不利，而且也助长了当地群众单纯依赖政府、不积极用自己力量克服困难的思想。邹常杰这种和片面群众观点结合着的不深入工作的官僚主义作风是十分有害的。建议临湘县人民银行对他进行批评，并希望各地负责发放贷款工作的同志也防止这种做法。  蓝  波
    一周读者来信主要情况
    一月二十五日到二月一日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信一千九百四十二件，各机关答复读者的信二百八十四件。
    从不少来信中可以看出：群众性的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，在党和人民政府的领导和支持下，正日益广泛地开展起来。八天中，读者揭发官僚主义作风和违法乱纪行为的来信数量不断增加。运动开展的范围也逐渐广泛，已开始遍及政法、财经、文教各系统。在政法系统中，读者揭发了一些县级以上的领导机关和领导干部压制民主、打击批评者的恶劣行为和包庇、纵容下级干部违法乱纪行为的官僚主义作风；在财经系统中，读者揭发了一些国家企业机关漠视群众合理化建议、违反财政纪律和浪费国家资财的错误行为，以及某些财经干部的强迫命令作风；在文教系统中，读者揭发了一些教育行政机关和学校的领导干部漠视甚至压制群众意见以及地方报纸忽视群众工作的不良现象。本报最近连续揭发官僚主义和违法乱纪行为典型事件、支持群众正义斗争的做法，受到广大读者的拥护，也使广大读者受到了教育和鼓舞。此外，也有个别读者在来信中反映出他们在对领导机关和领导干部提出批评时还有着一些思想顾虑；但随着运动的开展，这种来信的数量是愈来愈少了。
    在大量有关基本建设问题的来信中，有一部分是对一月二十九日本报“读者来信专页”提出的“在基本建设工地里应不应该建立合作社”问题发表意见的。来信的建筑工人、合作社社员、大学合作系学生等一致认为：全国合作总社提出的不宜在工地发展合作社组织的看法是不对的。
