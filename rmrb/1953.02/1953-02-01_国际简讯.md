    Serious Housing Shortage in Britain
    According to recently published British official statistics, at the beginning of last year, 171,567 families were registered in London waiting for housing. The situation elsewhere is no better. The British "Picture Post" gives an example, saying that in Pelsall, Staffordshire, a family of five who have been waiting for accommodation since 1949 are still living in a place that can only fit one bed.

    Sharp Rise in Prices of Major Foods in Britain Last Year
    On January 22, Labour MP Lewis questioned the Minister of Food in the House of Commons, asking him to note the fact that the prices of many foods had risen in 1952. According to Lewis, flour rose by 53 to 56 percent, canned meat by more than 30 percent, tea by 33 percent, butter by 20 percent, cheese by 86 percent, bread by 25 percent, fresh meat by 21 percent, and milk by 19 percent.

    British Arms Expansion Creates Huge Fiscal Deficit
    In the fiscal year 1952-1953, ending March 31, 1953, the British government's expenditure will exceed revenue by 300 million pounds. This fiscal deficit is mainly caused by the cost of arms expansion, which was added after the military spending estimates in the budget announced in March 1952. The military spending exceeding the budget estimates was submitted to Parliament in the form of a "supplementary estimate" white paper. The most recent supplementary estimate submitted to Parliament on January 21 requested an additional 164 million pounds in funding. According to the British "Daily Worker," 133 million pounds of this is for war preparations.

    英国房荒情况严重
    据最近公布的英国官方统计数字，去年初伦敦登记等候住宅的计有十七万一千五百六十七个家庭。别处的情况也不见好。英国“星期画报”举出一个例子，该报说：在斯塔福德郡佩尔萨尔地方，自从一九四九年以来就在等待住所的一个五口之家，现仍住在只能放一张床的地方。
    去年英国主要食品价格剧烈上涨
    英国工党议员路易斯一月二十二日在下院向粮食大臣提出质询，请他注意一九五二年许多食品价格已经上涨的事实。据路易斯说，面粉涨了百分之五十三到五十六、罐头肉涨了百分之三十以上、茶叶涨了百分之三十三、奶油涨了百分之二十、干酪涨了百分之八十六、面包涨了百分之二十五、鲜肉涨了百分之二十一、牛奶涨了百分之十九。
    英国扩军备战造成庞大财政赤字
    英国在到一九五三年三月三十一日为止的一九五二—一九五三年财政年度中，英国政府的支出超过收入将达三亿英镑。这个财政赤字主要是由扩军费用造成的，这笔费用是在一九五二年三月宣布预算中的军费概算后又加上去的。超过预算概算的军费是以“补充概算”白皮书的形式提交议会的。一月二十一日提交议会的最近一次补充概算要求再增加一亿六千四百万英镑的用款。据英国“工人日报”估计，其中有一亿三千三百万英镑作为备战之用。
