    The movement to implement the Marriage Law is about to begin. This is a major event. It concerns every family and every individual, especially young people, and the entire country. Every organization and member of the Communist Youth League should pay attention to this matter and actively participate in this movement.

    More than two years ago, the Central People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law. It aims to abolish the old feudal marriage system and implement a new democratic marriage system, so that every couple can love each other, every family can be united and harmonious, and everyone can be happy and work hard in production. Nearly three years have passed, but many people still do not understand the Marriage Law, and many people violate the Marriage Law. They still arrange young people's marriages, interfere with others' freedom of marriage, do not care about their children's happiness, and oppress and abuse women. This has led to many disharmonious families, much mental suffering, and lack of focus on work and production. They also don't care about raising their children; many cruel and terrible things happen frequently, such as forcing people to death and killing people. The feudal marriage system continues to harm people and hinder the country's construction. Therefore, the People's Government is determined to implement the Marriage Law. Our Communist Youth League should care about the suffering of the people and the interests of the motherland. We cannot turn a blind eye to these things. We must faithfully implement the Party's policies, actively respond to the call of the People's Government, and work hard to implement the Marriage Law.

    Implementing the Marriage Law means opposing feudalism, but this is different from the land reform that overthrew the feudal landlord class. Marriage involves every family, and feudal ideas have more or less influence on most people. To remove this influence from the minds of so many people, we cannot rely solely on the People's Government issuing orders. It mainly depends on many people conducting propaganda and reasoning with the masses to get their thinking straight. Every member of the Communist Youth League should do propaganda work to the masses in the movement to implement the Marriage Law and learn this skill.

    To promote the Marriage Law effectively, you must first thoroughly understand the many principles of the Marriage Law yourself. The policies and decrees of our People's Government are formulated based on the interests of the majority of the people and serve the people. Every article has its own reason. With reason, we can convince the vast majority of people and make them willing to implement it. In the past, many of our comrades, although wholeheartedly doing good things for the people, often made mistakes of coercion and commandism when doing them. The reason was that they did not understand the principles themselves and did not consult with the masses. To understand the principles of the Marriage Law, our Communist Youth League must first launch a movement to study the Marriage Law. During the study, if there are any unclear or doubtful points, be sure to ask boldly. During the study, you should also check yourself: What incorrect views do you have on the Marriage Law? What wrong behaviors have you done? Sweep away the feudal dust that has stained your mind. Only in this way can we understand the principles more thoroughly and speak with confidence to persuade others.

    After understanding the Marriage Law yourself, you should try your best to promote it to others. When promoting it to young people and middle-aged people, you should pay more attention to promoting it to the elderly. You must know that changing the "feudal minds" of so many people is not an easy task. You must be patient, not impatient, and reason with them gently and repeatedly, explaining the principles clearly and stating the policies clearly. An important method of reasoning is to cite actual examples from the local area, comparing good and bad examples, so that everyone can distinguish right from wrong. Another important method of reasoning is to focus on the doubts and confusions in people's minds. For example, some people think that free marriage is good, but divorce is not good, and that supporting people's divorce is immoral. We should patiently explain to them that although the Marriage Law stipulates freedom of divorce, it does not advocate casual divorce. All couples, regardless of their past circumstances, should be persuaded to reconcile as long as they can still reconcile. However, for some couples who were bound together in the past and now have very bad feelings, and one party firmly demands a divorce, everyone should support them in pursuing their own future. If they are forced to stay together, it will only increase their pain and even lead to murder, which is truly immoral. For example, some people think that the implementation of the Marriage Law has increased women's power, which has made families disharmonious. We should carefully explain to them that the Marriage Law stipulates equality between men and women, prohibits husbands from beating and scolding their wives, prohibits parents-in-law from abusing their daughters-in-law, and prohibits treating women as livestock to be bought and sold, but it does not advocate women oppressing men. This recognition that men and women are the same is really fair. And only in this way can couples truly love each other, and families can truly be harmonious and united. For example, some people think that freedom of marriage will lead young people to be indecent. We should carefully discuss with them: How did some good young people in the past become indecent later? Isn't it because they were dissatisfied with arranged and forced marriages and went outside to fool around? If marriage is decided by the children themselves, the feelings between husband and wife will naturally be good, which can make them feel at ease in production and also make some indecent young people become decent. In short, every article of the Marriage Law is reasonable and justifiable. We must solve many specific ideological problems of the masses based on the provisions of the Marriage Law so that everyone is convinced. Only when the thinking of the broad masses of the people is straightened out can the implementation of the Marriage Law become a truly mass movement.

    In the movement to implement the Marriage Law, we will definitely encounter many things that violate the Marriage Law. These things are very complicated, including past and present, minor and serious, those who are confused in their thinking and occasionally commit a first offense, and those who knowingly violate the law and are very serious. For minor cases, we should reason with them and straighten out their thinking so that they will not commit the same mistake again. For less serious cases, we should advise them to admit their mistakes and correct them; if the circumstances are very serious, then we should work with the people, discuss democratically, and ask the People's Government to punish them according to law, the purpose of which is to make people dare not commit the crime again in the future. It should be remembered that it is the glorious responsibility of every member of the Communist Youth League to fight against all lawless and undisciplined bad people and bad deeds.

    To implement the Marriage Law, members of the Communist Youth League must not only promote it well to the masses of the people, but also set an example themselves. Members of the Communist Youth League should strive for their own marital autonomy and must not interfere with others' freedom of marriage; they should respect women and not abuse their wives; they should have a correct work style and not be promiscuous. Members of the Communist Youth League, whether married or not, should respect their elders, care for the young, work hard in production, study hard, work actively, and create model families. Members of the Communist Youth League should be enthusiastic and active, able to speak and act, have high morals, have a correct work style, be able to be models for young people, and be able to lead young people to do things together.

    Do not underestimate the Marriage Law, and do not regard the Marriage Law as just managing private household affairs. Once the Marriage Law is implemented, the lives of millions of families will become happier, and tens of millions of people will love their motherland more. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great motherland has begun its great construction. Let us work together to implement the Marriage Law, overthrow the feudal marriage system, and let the enthusiasm of the masses of the people be brought into greater play, strive for the victory of the motherland's construction, and welcome a more happy and beautiful tomorrow.

    青年团要积极参加贯彻婚姻法运动
    胡耀邦
    贯彻婚姻法的运动就要开始了。这是一件大事情。它对每个家庭每个人都有关系，特别是对青年有关系，也对整个国家有关系。每个青年团的组织和团员都应该重视这件事，并且要积极地参加这个运动。
    两年多以前，中央人民政府就颁布了婚姻法。要废除旧的封建婚姻制度，要实行新的民主婚姻制度，好使得每对夫妻都相亲相爱，每个家庭都团结和睦，大家精神愉快，努力劳动生产。时间过去了快三年，可是还有很多人不懂得婚姻法，有很多人违反婚姻法。他们照旧包办年轻人的终身大事、干涉别人的婚姻自由，不关心儿女的幸福，欺压和虐待妇女。这样就弄得许多家庭不和睦，许多人的精神很痛苦，工作生产都没心思干，生了儿女也没心思管；就经常发生逼死人、杀死人的许多残忍可怕的事情。封建婚姻制度这样照旧在害人，在妨害国家的建设，所以人民政府决心要把婚姻法贯彻下去。我们青年团应该关心人民的疾苦，关心祖国的利益，不能够睁眼看着这些事情不管，一定要忠实地执行党的政策，积极地响应人民政府的号召，努力贯彻婚姻法。
    贯彻婚姻法就是要反封建，但这和土地改革打倒封建地主阶级不同。婚姻家家都有，封建思想对大多数人都有或多或少的影响。要去掉许许多多人头脑中的这种影响，就不能单靠人民政府下命令，主要是靠许多人向人民群众做宣传，讲道理，打通思想。每个青年团员都要在贯彻婚姻法运动中向人民群众作宣传工作，学习这一门本领。
    要把婚姻法宣传得好，必须自己认真弄清婚姻法的许多道理。我们人民政府的政策法令，是根据大多数人的利益订出来的，是为人民服务的，条条都是有道理的。有了道理，就可以说服最大多数的人，就可以使最大多数人乐意执行。过去我们有许多同志虽然忠心地为人民办好事，但办的时候往往犯强迫命令的错误，其原因就在于自己没有把道理弄通，又不和群众商量。为了弄通婚姻法的道理，我们青年团必须首先来一个学习婚姻法的运动。学习的时候，遇有不了解或怀疑的地方，一定要大胆地问。学习当中，还应该联系检查一下自己：对婚姻法有什么不正确的看法？有什么不对的行为？把自己思想上沾染的封建灰尘打扫干净。只有这样，才会把道理弄得更透彻，才能理直气壮地去说服别人。
    在自己懂得了婚姻法之后，就要尽量向别人宣传。向青年人、中年人宣传，更要注意向老人家宣传。要知道，使许许多多人的“封建脑筋”换过来，这并不是一件容易的事。要有耐心，不能急躁，要和和气气，反反复复地讲道理，把道理讲得明明白白，把政策说得清清楚楚。讲道理的一个重要方法，就是要举本地的实际例子，用好坏例子作比较，让大家去辨别是非。讲道理的另一个重要方法，就是要针对人家心里怀疑和想不通的地方下功夫。例如：有人觉得自由结婚倒好，离婚却不好，赞成人家离婚是缺德的。我们就应该向他耐心地解释：婚姻法虽然规定离婚自由，可是并不主张随随便便的离婚。所有的夫妻，不管他们过去情况怎样，只要他们两人还可能和好，就应该好言好语劝说他们和好下去。但有些过去捆绑结成的夫妻，现在感情很坏，一方坚决要求离婚，大家就应该支持他们各奔前程，如果硬要强迫他们继续在一起，只是增加他们的痛苦，甚至弄出人命案来，那才真正缺德。又如：有人觉得实行了婚姻法，妇女的权力大了，反而使家庭不和睦。我们就应该向他仔细地讲道理：婚姻法规定的是男女平等，不准丈夫打骂老婆，不准公婆虐待媳妇，不准把妇女当作牲口拿来买卖，可是并没有主张妇女压迫男人。这样承认男女都一样的是人，实在公道得很。并且只有这样，夫妻才能真正相亲相爱，家庭才能真正和睦团结。再如：有人觉得婚姻自由，会引得年青人不正派。我们就应该和他仔细地讨论：过去有些好好的年青人后来学得不正派，究竟是怎样来的？难道不是由于他们不满意包办强迫婚姻而跑到外面去胡闹吗？如果婚姻是由儿女自己作主，夫妻感情自然就会好，就能够使他们安心生产，也就会使得一些不正派的年青人变得正派起来。总之，婚姻法条条都是合情合理的。我们一定要根据婚姻法的条文，解决群众中的许多具体思想问题，使大家口服心服。广大群众的思想都打通了，贯彻婚姻法才能成为真正群众性的运动。
    在贯彻婚姻法的运动中，我们一定会碰到许多违反婚姻法的事情。这些事情，情况又很复杂，有过去的，有现在的，有轻的，有重的，有出于思想糊涂偶尔初犯的，也有明知故犯非常严重的。情节轻的，我们就应该向他们好好讲道理，打通他们的思想，使他们不再犯。情节不太重的，我们就要劝他们承认错误，改正错误；倘若情节很严重，那就应该和人民一道，大家民主商讨，要求人民政府依法惩办，其目的是要使人们今后不敢再犯法。应该记住：向一切违法乱纪的坏人坏事作斗争，是每个青年团员的光荣责任。
    贯彻婚姻法，青年团员不但要好好向人民群众宣传，还一定要自己做出榜样来。青年团员要争取自己的婚姻自主，也不得干涉别人的婚姻自由；要尊重妇女，不能虐待妻子；要作风正派，不能行为放荡。青年团员，不论是已结婚的或还没有结婚的，都应该尊敬长辈，爱护幼小，勤劳生产，努力学习，积极工作，创造模范的家庭。青年团员应该是热情积极，能说能做，道德高尚，作风正派，能做青年群众的模范，能带动青年群众一道干事的人。
    不要小看婚姻法，不要把婚姻法看作只是管私人家务事。婚姻法一旦贯彻，千百万家庭的生活变得更幸福，千千万万的人们将更加热爱祖国。伟大的祖国在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，已开始伟大的建设。让我们同心合力贯彻婚姻法，把封建婚姻制度打垮，让人民群众中的积极性更大地发挥出来，争取祖国建设的胜利，迎接更加幸福美好的明天。
