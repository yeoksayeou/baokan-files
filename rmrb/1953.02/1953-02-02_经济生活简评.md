Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Learning the Leadership Method of "One Station, Three Networks"
    The leadership method of "one station, three networks" implemented by Wu'xiang County in last year's patriotic production increase campaign is a new creation in rural production leadership.
    The patriotic bumper harvest campaign widely carried out across the country last year achieved great results. However, there were still many problems in this movement. For example, some places only concentrated their efforts on cultivating "typical examples" and establishing "banners," while forgetting what the significance and role of "typical examples" and "banners" were. They did not pay attention to increasing production in more villages and larger areas, thus resulting in the phenomenon of "booming on the spots, but being cold on the surface." Some cadres only paid attention to the work of advanced villages, regardless of the work of "backward villages," so that some villages were "three to five miles apart, but several years behind." This situation is extremely incompatible with the large-scale economic construction that our country is carrying out. Wu'xiang's leadership method of "one station, three networks" has made a good start in solving this problem.
    Of course, various places must proceed from the specific circumstances of the time and place when learning Wu'xiang County's leadership method of "one station, three networks," and must not mechanically transplant it regardless of specific conditions. In areas where working conditions are not available, it is impossible to immediately establish "one station, three networks," but its combination of points and areas, observation and visits, and the practice and spirit of exchanging experiences in various ways can be learned.
    Drawing Lessons from the "Piglet Incident" and Doing a Good Job in Spring Festival Commodity Supply
    Recently, the Shanghai Liberation Daily exposed the infuriating "Piglet Incident." This incident caused a loss of 27 billion yuan in national wealth. In mid-September last year, the East China District Company of the China Native Produce Company and its affiliated Pig Industry Marketing Department blindly purchased live pigs in order to "ensure a sufficient supply of pork in the city (Shanghai) during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival," resulting in a large backlog. The company did not carefully consider a series of important issues such as storage, transportation, and feeding beforehand, resulting in a large number of live pigs dying of hunger, being squeezed to death, and dying of illness. From April to November last year, the company's live pigs died a total of more than 54,000. This is a very alarming waste.
    The leading cadres of the company should bear the main responsibility for this serious accident. After receiving instructions from their superiors on ensuring the supply of pork in Shanghai during the festival, they neither checked the sales volume of pork during the same period in previous years, nor did they properly estimate how much the purchasing power of Shanghai consumers had increased, nor did they count the number of live pigs in stock. They blindly ordered a plan and ordered their subordinates to carry out purchases "as quickly as possible, as much as possible." There is no doubt that their approach would inevitably lead to a series of serious problems.
    This lesson should be noted by state-owned trading enterprises in various places. The Spring Festival of 1953 is approaching, and state-owned trading institutions in various countries must earnestly study the local market situation, study the consumers' requirements for the quantity, type, and specifications of commodities during the Spring Festival, in order to formulate a more accurate supply plan based on these actual materials, and earnestly do a good job in a series of work such as storage, transportation, storage, allocation, etc., to organize and plan to meet the needs of the vast number of consumers during the Spring Festival, and avoid all waste and losses.

    经济生活简评
    学习“一站三网”的领导方法
    武乡县在去年爱国增产竞赛运动中所试行的“一站三网”的领导方法，是农村生产领导上的一个新的创造。
    去年全国各地普遍开展的爱国丰产竞赛运动，得到了很大的成绩。但在这个运动中，还存在不少问题。例如，有些地方只集中力量培养“典型”，树立“旗帜”，而忘掉了“典型”和“旗帜”的意义和作用是什么。他们不注意更多村庄更大面积的增产，因此就发生了“点上轰轰烈烈，面上冷冷清清”的现象。有些干部只注意先进村的工作，而不管“落后村”的工作，以致有些村庄“相距三五里，相差好几年”。这种情况和我们国家所开展的大规模的经济建设是极不相称的。武乡“一站三网”的领导方法，在解决这个问题上，作了一个良好的开端。
    当然，各地学习武乡县的“一站三网”的领导方法，必须从当时当地的具体情况出发，不能不顾具体条件地机械搬运。在工作条件不具备的地区，不可能立即成立“一站三网”，但其点面结合，观摩访问，用各种方式交流经验的作法和精神，则是可以学习的。
    吸取“猪子事件”的教训做好春节商品供应工作
    最近上海解放日报揭发了令人愤慨的“猪子事件”。这个事件使国家财富损失二百七十亿元。去年九月中旬，中国土产公司华东区公司及所属猪业运销部为了“保证国庆、中秋期间全市（上海）猪肉充分供应”，盲目收购毛猪，形成大量积压现象。该公司事前对储运、饲养等一系列重要问题，根本没有周到地加以考虑，以致毛猪饿死、挤死和病死的很多。从去年四月到十一月，该公司的毛猪共死亡五万四千多只。这是十分惊人的浪费。
    该公司的领导干部对于这种严重的事故要负主要的责任。他们接到上级关于保证上海市过节期间的猪肉供应的指示后，既不检查往年同时期中猪肉的销售量，也没有很好地估计上海市消费者的购买力增加了多少，又没有清点库存毛猪的数量，就盲目地订了计划，命令下级“越快越好，越多越好”地进行收购。他们这种作法，必然引起一连串的严重问题，是毫无疑问的。
    这种教训，应该引起各地国营贸易企业的注意。一九五三年的春节就要到来，各国营贸易机构必须切实地研究当地市场的情况，研究消费者在春节期间对商品数量、种类、规格等的要求，以便根据这些实际的材料拟出比较精确的供应计划，并认真作好有关储运、保管、调拨等一系列的工作，在春节期间有组织、有计划地满足广大消费者的需要，并避免一切浪费损失。
