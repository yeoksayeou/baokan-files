Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Taylor, the newly appointed commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, arrived in Korea from Tokyo on the 3rd together with Clark, and visited the puppet Syngman Rhee on the 3rd. According to the Associated Press, Taylor is scheduled to take over Van Fleet's position at the end of this week.

Eisenhower is pinning his hopes on Taylor to reverse the defeat of the war of aggression against Korea. Before Taylor left the United States for the Far East, Eisenhower summoned him to give him personal instructions. Taylor held secret meetings in Tokyo with Clark and U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins to discuss steps to continue and expand the war. Taylor then inspected U.S. military equipment in Japan, U.S. air force bases, and the British naval base in Iwakuni, Japan. He also made a special visit to the U.S. 187th Airborne Regiment.

However, Taylor will be equally unable to accomplish the tasks that Ridgway and Van Fleet failed to accomplish. At a press conference in Seoul, he claimed to be "a complete greenhorn," thus preparing a fig leaf in advance for his inevitable failure in the future. According to the Associated Press, Taylor seemed hesitant when he walked into Eighth Army headquarters. Clark was standing beside him "mocking" and said, "Work hard. It's too late to back out now." There is a reason why Clark said this sharp word. According to the "New York Post" on January 28, Eisenhower was considering replacing the useless Clark with Taylor as the commander-in-chief of the U.S. aggressor forces in Korea. But Taylor apparently also knew that his fate would not be better than that of Van Fleet or Clark.

### 侵朝美军头子泰勒到朝鲜

    侵朝美军头子泰勒到朝鲜
    【新华社五日讯】新任侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒已于三日和克拉克一起由东京到达朝鲜，并在三日访问了傀儡李承晚。据合众社报道，泰勒准备在本星期末接替范佛里特的职务。
    艾森豪威尔把挽回侵朝战争败局的希望寄托在泰勒身上。在泰勒由美国动身来远东以前，艾森豪威尔曾经把他召去面授机宜。泰勒在东京和克拉克以及美国陆军参谋长柯林斯举行了秘密会议，讨论继续和扩大战争的步骤。泰勒接着又视察了美国在日本的军事设备，美国空军基地和英国在日本岩国的海军基地，他还特别访问了美国第一八七空运团。
    但是泰勒同样无法完成李奇微、范佛里特所没有能够完成的任务。他在汉城举行的记者招待会上自称“十足是一个生手”，这样就替他今后必然要遭遇的失败预先准备好了遮羞布。据合众社报道，泰勒在走进第八军总部时显得有些踌躇。当时克拉克就在旁边“讥笑”说：“你使劲干吧。现在要撒手也已太迟了。”克拉克说这句尖刻的话不是没有原因的。据“纽约邮报”在一月二十八日报道，艾森豪威尔正在考虑撤换不中用的克拉克，而由泰勒来担任侵朝美军总司令。但是泰勒显然也知道，他的命运决不会比范佛里特或克拉克更好一些。
