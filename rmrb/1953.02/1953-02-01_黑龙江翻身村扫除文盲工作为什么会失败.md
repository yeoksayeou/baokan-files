Why the Illiteracy Eradication Work in Fanshen Village, Heilongjiang Failed
Wu Chongyuan
Fanshen Village is a village in the Fourteenth District of Keshan County, Heilongjiang. The village has 247 households, 1,047 people, and 917.4 hectares of cultivated land. After the land reform in 1947, the village's economic life improved due to two consecutive years of bumper harvests, and almost every household bought a large cart and livestock.

Due to the rising economic life and the improvement of political awareness, the people of the whole village universally demanded to learn culture. In 1948, the village established a winter school with 40 students; in 1949, the winter school developed into four locations, and the number of students increased to 298; in 1950, with the help and guidance of the provincial and county cultural and educational departments, all winter school students were transferred to year-round civilian schools. At that time, the masses had a high enthusiasm for production and learning, truly "grain carts, firewood carts, and mules and horses lined up in rows, men and women, old and young, talking and laughing on their way to civilian schools." Thus, "Fanshen Village" won the title of "Model Literacy Village."

In 1950, there was a drought, and the village's 400 hectares of soybean land generally suffered a poor harvest; in 1951, there was spring drought and summer-autumn flooding, and the harvest was also very poor. Since then, the economic living standards of the entire village have declined.

At this time, drought prevention, flood prevention, and engaging in sideline production were the central tasks of the whole village people and the universal demands of the masses; however, the village cadres adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards this work. They did not lead the whole village people to carry out drought prevention, flood prevention, or sideline production, but blindly emphasized cultural learning, using cultural learning to replace the central work of production and weathering the famine. In their view, this was the only effective way to maintain the title of "Literacy Model Village."

The erroneous leadership brought great harm to the people of the whole village. By the summer hoeing season in 1952, more than half of the village's 22 mutual aid teams had "disbanded," and the remaining mutual aid teams were also in a state of paralysis. The phenomenon of abandoning land and wasteland was extremely serious: 12.6 hectares of land were not sown, 54 hectares of land were not hoed after sowing, the remaining land was hoed only once or twice, and another 75 hectares of land suffered from hail, pests, and floods.

The disaster situation in the village became more serious, and half of the village was short of food and had to rely on government assistance. However, the county "illiteracy eradication pilot work group" turned a blind eye to this situation, did not promptly report it to the Party organization, and, at the insistence of District Head Gu Zhendong, used the village as a pilot project, using the method of "comprehensive expansion" to carry out the illiteracy eradication movement. The working group of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education knew that the "comprehensive expansion" approach was not right, but did not persuade or dissuade the masses and cadres. The village branch secretary, Yu Zhanhe, mistakenly propagandized to the masses:

"Going to study means going hungry, staying at home also means going hungry, so it's better to go to the literacy class." And in order to force the masses to enroll, when distributing regulated grain, they stipulated: "Loafers will not receive it, and those who do not study well will not receive it." Some Party members in the village therefore abandoned the land; some took the lead in "jumping out of the team," breaking away from the mutual aid team. The masses, however, thought that if the cadres came to mobilize them to go to school, it would be unreasonable not to go; some were afraid that they would not get regulated grain if they did not go to school, so they abandoned production and went to school. The village's Communist Youth League organization was also the same, not concerned about production, but one-sidedly emphasizing cultural learning.

Although the accelerated literacy classes were set up, the results were very bad. At the beginning, 303 people were mobilized to study (about a quarter of the village's population), but later only 189 people remained, and only a few dozen people could regularly attend class. Although many people were in the classroom, their minds were preoccupied with the next meal. For example, student Zhao Zhenduo often held his head during class. When someone asked him why he was doing this, he replied: "My family of a dozen people has nothing to eat, and my mind is all on that!"

The lesson of failure in the illiteracy eradication work in Fanshen Village has attracted the attention of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The provincial committee leadership has educated all cultural and educational cadres on this matter, explaining that cultural and educational work must serve production, and that learning and production must be combined; and in the Party rectification, the village's Party members were educated, reducing the "scope of expansion" of the illiteracy eradication work, and only organizing the masses who can participate in learning to continue learning. The People's Government has also taken effective measures to help the village rectify its production organization, carry out various sideline productions, and prepare for the spring production.

    黑龙江翻身村扫除文盲工作为什么会失败
    吴重远
    翻身村是黑龙江克山县十四区的一个村子。全村有二百四十七户，一千零四十七人，耕地九百十七点四垧。一九四七年土地改革完成后，因连续两年获得大丰收，全村人民的经济生活提高了，几乎每家都买了大车和牲口。
    由于经济生活的上升和政治觉悟的提高，全村人民普遍要求学习文化。一九四八年，村里搞了一处冬学，有学员四十人；一九四九年，冬学发展到四处，学员增加到二百九十八名；一九五○年，在省、县文教部门的帮助和指导下，冬学学员全部转入常年民校学习。当时，群众的生产和学习情绪是很高的，真是“粮车、柴车、骡马连成行，男女老少说说笑笑上民校”。这样，“翻身村”就获得了“模范识字村”的称号。
    一九五○年，发生了旱灾，村里的四百垧大豆地普遍歉收；一九五一年，春旱夏秋涝，收成也很不好。从此，全村人民的经济生活水平便下降了。
    这时，防旱、防涝，搞副业生产，乃是全村人民的中心任务，也是群众的普遍要求；可是村干部竟对这一工作采取了放任自流的态度，他们不去领导全村群众进行防旱、防涝，搞副业生产，却盲目地强调文化学习，以文化学习来代替生产度荒的中心工作。在他们看来，这是保持“识字模范村”称号的惟一有效办法。
    错误的领导给全村人民带来了极大的危害。到一九五二年夏锄期间，全村二十二个互助组半数以上都“散伙”了，其余的互助组也都处于瘫痪状态。扔地、荒地的现象极为严重：十二点六垧地没有下种，五十四垧地下种后没有铲趟，其余的地也只进行了一两遍铲趟，另有七十五垧地遭受了雹灾、虫灾、水灾。
    村里的灾荒现象更严重起来了，全村有半数的人缺粮，必须依靠政府的帮助。而县“扫盲试点工作组”却对这种情况熟视无睹，没有及时向党的组织反映，竟在区长谷振东的坚决要求下，以该村为试点，用“全面铺开”的方法，开展了扫除文盲运动。黑龙江省文教厅的工作组明知“全面铺开”的作法是不对头的，也没有向群众、干部进行说服、劝阻。村支部书记于占河，则错误地向群众宣传：
    “去学习是饿肚子，在家待着也是饿肚子，不如上识字班。”并为了强迫群众入学，在发调剂粮时，竟规定：“二流子不发，学习不好的不发。”村里的某些党员因此就扔下了土地；有的带头“跳组”，脱离互助组。而群众则以为，干部来动员上学，如果不去就说不过去；有的怕不上学就得不到调剂粮，也就扔下生产，上学去了。村的青年团组织，也同样如此，不关心生产，片面地强调文化学习。
    速成识字班虽然搞起来了，但成绩是很坏的。开始时，动员来学习的人有三百零三人（约占全村人口的四分之一），到后来只剩下了一百八十九人，而经常能到课的却只有几十个人。许多人虽然身在课堂上，可是他们的心却惦念着下一顿的粮食。例如，学员赵振铎在上课时往往抱着头，有人问他为什么这样，他回答说：“我家里十几口人没吃的，我的心都在这上头呢！”
    翻身村扫除文盲工作中的失败教训，已经引起中共黑龙江省委的注意。省委领导方面曾就此事向全省文教干部进行了教育，说明文化教育工作必须为生产服务，学习和生产必须结合起来；并在整党中向全村党员进行了教育，缩小了扫除文盲工作的“铺开面”，只组织能参加学习的群众继续学习。人民政府也采取有效的办法，帮助该村整顿生产组织，进行各种副业生产，为春季大生产做准备。
