Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 11th: According to a Vietnam News Agency front-line reporter on the 9th, the French invading forces besieged at Na San for over a month recently ventured out to plunder food and expand their occupied area, resulting in a heavy blow from the Vietnamese People's Army.

    The battle took place on Highway 41 between Hoat Luat and Co Noi, southeast of Na San. At dawn on January 1st, a unit of the People's Army quickly and successively occupied three hills occupied by the French army, annihilated French patrols, and severely struck a battalion of French troops who counterattacked. The People's Army mortars on the hills west of the highway also joined the battle. At this time, another unit of the People's Army launched a fierce attack on two French companies defending the highway. Under the head-on blow of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French paratroopers who committed the attack fled in panic. The People's Army pursued the fleeing French troops separately, shooting and throwing grenades at them. Most of the French paratroopers were killed, and the others surrendered to the People's Army. In this two-hour battle, the People's Army annihilated nearly two companies of French paratroopers.
    [Xinhua News Agency] In the Red River Delta, despite the French invading forces' strict defense of their important transportation lines, this still could not prevent the Vietnamese People's guerrillas from attacking and destroying these transportation lines. The attacks and destruction of Highway 39, an important strategic highway of the French army traversing Hung Yen province, is a typical example.

    According to Vietnam News Agency, in order to protect Highway 39, the French army burned all the villages on both sides of the highway long ago and drove away the residents. The French army set up many outposts and strongholds along the highway, and opened fire on anything that moved. However, these brutal measures by the French army did not subdue the local people, nor did they guarantee the safety of the highway. French military vehicles on the highway were often destroyed by landmines, watchtowers were blown up, and patrols were ambushed.

    Last winter, encouraged by the victory of the People's Army's autumn-winter offensive, the local people, regardless of the French army's gunfire, participated in the activity of destroying Highway 39 one night, regardless of gender or age. This brought the French army's transportation to a standstill for several days and forced them to send additional armored vehicles and more troops to strengthen the defense of the highway.

    Even so, the highway was still inevitably attacked. For example, at the end of last December, the Changsha Iron Bridge on the highway, which was heavily defended by the French army, was blown up by guerrillas. Thirty French soldiers were killed or wounded, and one armored vehicle was destroyed. The next day, ten French military vehicles heading towards the iron bridge also hit landmines, and one was blown up.

    越南人民军在那岑附近
    歼灭法军伞兵两个连
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社前线记者九日报道：在那岑被包围了一个多月的法国侵略部队，最近冒险出来掠夺粮食和扩大占领区，结果遭到越南人民军的沉重打击。
    战斗发生在那岑东南的喝律和固锐之间的第四十一号公路上。一月一日破晓时分，人民军的一支部队迅速地连续占领了法军侵占的三个山头，歼灭法军的巡逻队，并痛击反扑的一营法军。在公路西的山头上的人民军迫击炮也参加战斗。这时，人民军的另一支部队则向防守公路的法军两个连发动猛烈进攻。在越南人民军的迎头痛击下，出犯的法军伞兵狼狈逃跑。人民军分头追击溃逃的法军，向他们射击和投掷手榴弹，法军伞兵大部分被打死，其他则向人民军投降。在这一次两小时的战斗中，人民军歼灭法军伞兵近两个连。
    【新华社讯】在红河三角洲，尽管法国侵略部队严密防守他们的重要交通线，但是，这仍然未能防止越南人民游击队对这些交通线的袭击和破坏。横越兴安省的法军重要战略公路——第三十九号公路所遭到的袭击和破坏，就是一个典型的例子。
    据越南通讯社讯：为了保护第三十九号公路，法军很久以前就将公路两旁的村庄全部烧毁，把居民赶走。法军沿公路设立了许多岗哨据点，看到活动的东西就开枪射击。但是法军的这些残暴措施并没有使当地人民屈服，也没有能保证公路的安全。公路上的法军车辆经常被地雷炸毁，了望塔被炸掉，巡逻队遭到伏击。
    去年冬天，当地人民受到人民军秋冬攻势胜利的鼓舞，在一天夜里，不顾法军的开枪射击，不分男女老少一齐参加了破坏第三十九号公路的活动。这使法军的运输和交通停顿了好几天，并迫使他们增派了装甲车和更多的部队来加强公路的守卫。
    虽然这样，公路仍然免不了遭到袭击。例如去年十二月底，由法军严加防守的公路上的长社铁桥就被游击队炸毁了。法军有三十人被打死、打伤，装甲车一辆被击毁。第二天，向铁桥方向驶来的十辆法军车辆也触地雷，有一辆被炸坏。
