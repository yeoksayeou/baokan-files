Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 26th: The Warsaw Local Military Court, on the 18th, tried two spies who were dropped by a U.S. military aircraft on November 4, 1952, when it intruded into Polish airspace, and sentenced them to death. After the trial began, the prosecutor pointed out in the indictment that the U.S. imperialist intelligence agencies, colluding with groups of exiles who betrayed the Polish people, trained spies in West Germany, provided them with the necessary equipment, money, and forged documents, and instructed them to infiltrate Poland to carry out sabotage activities. The two defendants in this case, Szczepan Skrzyszowski and Dionizy Sosnowski, were spies who had been trained and driven by U.S. intelligence agencies in West Germany in this way. After they were parachuted by a U.S. aircraft and landed in Poland last year, they first hid the weapons and other equipment they were carrying, and then went to central cities to carry out espionage activities and set up a spy network. During the trial, the defendants pleaded guilty to their crimes of espionage. The Warsaw Local Military Court finally sentenced them to death.

    波判处美机空降两特务死刑
    【新华社二十六日讯】华沙消息：华沙地方军事法庭在十八日审讯了一九五二年十一月四日美国军用飞机侵入波兰领空时投下的两名特务，并将他们判处死刑。审讯开始后，检察官在起诉书中指出：美帝国主义的情报机关和背叛波兰人民的流亡分子集团相勾结，在西德训练特务分子，然后供给他们以必要的装备、金钱和伪造文件，指使他们潜入波兰，进行破坏活动。这个案件中的两名被告——斯梯潘·斯克齐斯佐夫斯基和迪奥尼齐·索斯诺夫斯基，就是这样接受西德境内美国情报机关的训练和驱使的特务分子。他们去年被美机空投并降落波境后，先把随身携带的武器和其他装备隐藏起来，然后到中心城市去进行间谍活动，并布置间谍网。在审讯中，被告对他们进行间谍活动的罪行供认不讳。华沙地方军事法庭最后宣判，对他们处以死刑。
