    All Departments in Songjiang Province Actively Support Basic Construction Work
    Departments throughout Songjiang Province are taking practical actions to implement the spirit of prioritizing basic construction, actively supporting basic construction work with maximum effort.

    The preliminary engineering tasks determined for Songjiang Province this year require 6,500 cadres. Some construction units have relied on their own resources and transferred a batch of cadres from the production side, but they are still short of more than 3,000. In order to solve this problem, the Organization Department of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Personnel Department of the Provincial Government have successively transferred a large number of cadres from provincial administrative cadre schools and county, district, and village cadres. At present, except for engineers and technicians who cannot be resolved for the time being, party, administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and women's work cadres can basically adapt to actual work needs. The quality of these cadres is also relatively high, with Party and League members accounting for 50%. The general educational level is primary school. When all units transferred this group of cadres, they implemented the spirit of "drawing from the head, not the tail; drawing the strong, not the weak; drawing the principal, not the deputy."

    Currently, the province has more than 29,000 fixed construction workers, accounting for 60% of the labor force required for this year's construction tasks. The Provincial Propaganda Department, the Industrial Department, and the Provincial Engineering Bureau are vigorously conducting winter training. There is still a shortage of bricklayers. The Provincial Planning Commission, the Provincial Engineering Bureau, and the Labor Bureau are taking the following measures to solve this difficulty: organizing unregistered construction workers to register and fix another group of workers; planning to transfer a batch of construction workers from rural areas; investigating the number of workers needed by each construction unit and compiling a unified labor force allocation plan; formulating several regulations for the unified allocation of construction workers to prevent the phenomenon of private recruitment. In addition, the universal promotion of Su Changyou's double-handed slurry extrusion method and segmented parallel assembly line operation method by construction units can basically solve the difficulty of insufficient workers.

    According to the requirements of various basic construction units, local materials such as sand, stones, lime, cement tiles, clay tiles, and river stones can be supplied on time. The only shortage is red bricks. The Provincial Planning Commission and the Engineering Bureau jointly convened a unified balance conference for the allocation of local materials, and decided that the allocation principle should be heavy industry first, followed by local industry. It is imperative to ensure that important projects start on time. The Yuquan Lime Factory of the Provincial Department of Industry and the Harbin Plywood Factory are actively processing materials for basic construction units; the Provincial Coal Construction Company and the Harbin Hardware Machinery, Transportation and Electrical Equipment Company have also prepared small hardware, plumbing, electrical and other equipment.

    At present, the material preparation work of various basic construction units is proceeding very slowly. Only 40% of the materials allocated by the state and the local raw materials ordered have been completed, and most of them have not been transported. In addition to the continued active and proactive storage and transportation by the construction units, the Provincial Transportation Company has proposed the policy of first serving basic construction, concentrating all its efforts to meet the needs of basic construction. The specific methods are: educating all cadres to establish the concept of "putting basic construction in the primary position"; formulating a basic construction transportation plan to allocate transportation forces in a planned manner; improving transportation efficiency, vigorously developing combined transportation services, and closely integrating the transportation forces of railways, waterways, and highways; allocating vehicles from rural areas to meet the needs of basic construction; lowering freight rates to reduce the cost of basic construction projects.

    In addition, municipal construction, commercial cooperation, cultural publicity, culture, education, health and other departments are also actively serving basic construction. The Harbin Municipal Construction Department initially plans to open four gravel roads this year to basic construction areas, with investments accounting for 62% of the total investment in road construction in the city. It was decided to rebuild a bridge with heavy traffic on the road leading to the basic construction area into a permanent building. In order to facilitate traffic to the construction site, the Tram Factory is preparing to purchase more trams; the Automobile Factory has purchased twelve new large buses and changed the bus routes. The Harbin Department Store decided to establish retail stores at several larger construction sites to meet the material needs of construction workers as much as possible. (Pan Guohua)

### 松江省各部门积极支援基本建设工作

    松江省各部门积极支援基本建设工作
    松江省各部门以实际行动贯彻把基本建设放在首要地位的精神，都以最大力量积极支援基本建设工作。
    松江省今年初步确定的工程任务，需要六千五百名干部担任。有些建筑单位自力更生，从生产方面抽调了一批干部，但还缺少三千多名。中共松江省委组织部、省府人事厅为了解决这一问题，陆续从省行政干部学校和县、区、村干部中，抽调了大批干部。目前除工程师、技术员一时不能解决外，党、行政、工会、青年团和妇女工作干部基本上都可以适应实际工作需要。这些干部质量也比较高，党团员占百分之五十。文化水平一般是高小程度。各单位抽调这批干部的时候，都贯彻了“抽头不抽尾，抽强不抽弱，抽正不抽副”的精神。
    现在全省已固定建筑工人二万九千多名，占今年施工任务所需要的劳动力的百分之六十，现省委宣传部、工业部及省工程局正在大力进行冬训。现在还缺少一部分瓦工。省计划委员会、省工程局、劳动局正采取如下措施解决这一困难：组织未固定的建筑工人进行登记，再固定一批工人；有计划地从农村调拨一批建筑工人；调查各施工单位所需要的工人数字，编制统一调配劳动力计划；制订建筑工人统一调配的几项规定，防止私自招工现象发生。再加上各施工单位普遍推广苏长有双手挤浆法及分段平行流水作业法，基本上可以解决工人不足的困难。
    根据各基本建设单位的要求，目前地方材料，如砂子、石块、白灰，水泥瓦、粘土瓦、河流石等，都可按时供应，感到不足的只有红砖。省计划委员会、工程局曾联合召开统一平衡地方材料调拨会议，决定调拨原则为重工业第一，地方工业次之。必须保证重要工程按时开工。省工业厅玉泉石灰厂、哈尔滨胶合板厂正积极为基本建设单位加工材料；省煤建公司、哈尔滨市五金机械、交通电工器材公司也准备了小五金、水暖电气等各种器材。
    目前各基本建设单位材料准备工作进行得很迟缓，国家调拨材料和地方原材料订货只达百分之四十，而且大部未运。除各建筑单位继续积极主动进行储运外，省运输公司提出首先面向基本建设的方针，集中一切力量满足基本建设需要。具体方法是：教育全体干部，树立“把基本建设放在首要地位”的观念；制订基本建设运输计划，有计划地调配运输力量；提高运输效率，大力发展联运业务，把铁路、航路、公路三方面的运输力量密切结合起来；从农村调配车辆，满足基本建设需要；降低运价，减低基本建设工程成本。
    此外，市政建设、商业合作、文化宣传、文教卫生等各部门，也都积极为基本建设服务。哈尔滨市市政建设部门初步计划今年开辟四条碎石路，通往基本建设地区，投资共占全市道路修建总投资百分之六十二。决定把通往基本建设地区道路上的一座交通量较大的桥梁改建为永久性建筑。为了便利通往工程现场的交通，电车厂准备增购电车；汽车厂已购妥新式大公共汽车十二台，并变更了汽车线路。哈尔滨市百货公司决定在几个较大工地建立零售商店，尽量满足建筑工人物质需要。（潘国华）
