Xinhua News Agency, 19th: In commemoration of the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," the All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, forwarding it to the youth of colonial and semi-colonial countries. The telegram reads as follows:

To the World Federation of Democratic Youth and our young friends in colonial and semi-colonial countries:

On this occasion of February 21st, the Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System, Chinese youth warmly congratulate the World Federation of Democratic Youth on its achievements in supporting the youth of colonial and semi-colonial countries in their struggle for national independence and in defending world peace. Chinese youth, who were long oppressed by imperialism and have now been liberated, deeply care about the lives and struggles of the youth in colonial countries. We express our great sympathy for the courageous and arduous struggles waged by the youth of oppressed nations against imperialist aggression, for the defense of peace, and for the achievement of independence and freedom.

Chinese youth, in order to defend their motherland and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people on the Korean front against the American aggressors. Because American imperialism insists on detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, sabotaging the armistice negotiations, and attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, our struggle will continue until American imperialism is willing to stop and until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory. At the same time, Chinese youth are actively participating in the large-scale construction of the motherland with high labor enthusiasm and wisdom. We will unite more closely with the youth of the world to fight against imperialist aggression, to defend world peace, and to safeguard the vital rights of our youth.

All-China Democratic Youth Federation

    纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    我全国青联致电殖民地半殖民地国家青年
    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会为纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”致电世界民主青年联盟并转殖民地半殖民地国家的青年。电文如下：
    世界民主青年联盟并转殖民地半殖民地国家的青年朋友们：
    值此二月二十一日反对殖民制度斗争日，中国青年热烈地祝贺世界民主青年联盟在支援殖民地半殖民地国家的青年争取民族独立、保卫世界和平方面所获得的成就。曾经长期受帝国主义压迫而今天获得了解放的中国青年，深切关怀着殖民地国家青年们的生活和斗争。我们对被压迫民族的青年为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫和平、争取独立自由而进行的英勇艰苦的斗争，表示极大的同情。
    中国青年为了保卫自己祖国、保卫亚洲和世界和平，正在朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民并肩抗击美国侵略者。由于美帝国主义坚持扣留中朝战俘，破坏停战谈判，并且妄图扩大侵朝战争，我们的这个斗争，将继续下去，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。同时中国青年正以高度的劳动热情和智慧，积极参加祖国的大规模建设工作。我们将和全世界青年更密切地团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平、保卫我们青年的切身权利而斗争。中华全国民主青年联合总会
