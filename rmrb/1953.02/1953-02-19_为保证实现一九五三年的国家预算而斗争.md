    The “Report on the 1953 National Budget” passed by the 23rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee was announced yesterday. It comprehensively summarizes the changes in China's financial and economic situation over the past three years and vividly reflects the plan for the further development of our national economy and the increase in the material and cultural life of the people in the coming year. Guaranteeing the implementation of the 1953 national budget is an important part of guaranteeing the implementation of the 1953 national construction plan. This is a major political task for the people of the whole country.

    Under the state system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and under the superior economic system led by the socialist state-owned economy, the labor enthusiasm of our workers and peasants has been brought into full play, and various economic undertakings have been rapidly restored and developed. The majority of our industrial and agricultural production items have been restored to and exceeded the highest levels before liberation, with the exception of a few items. Therefore, our country can, on the one hand, concentrate the necessary funds to continuously expand production, increase social wealth, consolidate national defense, and improve the material and cultural life of the people; on the other hand, it can gradually increase the accumulation of national funds on the basis of rapid economic recovery and development, making it possible for us to start the first five-year construction plan. If we take the income and expenditure of our country in 1950 as 100, then in 1953, our country's income reached 336.29 and expenditure reached 342.97. The increase in our national budget reflects the healthy development of our economy and demonstrates that our national financial situation is based on a solid foundation and is constantly improving, and that our national budget policy is completely correct. The task of our national budget is to guarantee the development of national economic construction and cultural construction and to guarantee the needs of consolidating national defense by all means. In the total budget for 1953, in addition to defense expenditures, expenditures for national economic construction accounted for 44.34 percent, an increase of 300.4 billion yuan over 1952; expenditures for social, cultural, and educational construction accounted for 14.9 percent, an increase of 124.75 billion yuan over 1952. In national economic construction, industry, especially heavy industry, occupies the primary position. This demonstrates the principle of our national financial expenditure, which is to concentrate the use of national funds to develop the most decisive industries. This is completely in line with the interests of national industrialization and the fundamental interests of the people of our country. Among the various sources of national income, the profits and taxes paid by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives increased from 34.08 percent of the total national income in 1950 to 59.79 percent in 1953. This shows that our country's financial income is increasingly and obviously mainly dependent on the creative labor of the working class and on the increased production, improved labor productivity, reduced production costs, and increased profits of state-owned enterprises. This fact vividly proves how great a leading role the working class and the socialist state-owned economy are playing in our country.

    Our national budget has been approved. It expresses the indomitable will of our country and people to resolutely strive for the great victory in the first year of our country's five-year plan on the basis of the current comprehensive recovery of our financial and economic situation. The basis for compiling this budget is that our country's industrial capital construction and industrial production will have significant development in 1953, agriculture and water conservancy construction will have new and great development, and cultural and educational undertakings will also have important development. This will give our people huge benefits. Therefore, the people of our country must supervise the implementation of the national budget by the national financial and economic organs and all state-owned enterprise departments and various business departments with the greatest concern, and must strive with the greatest effort to guarantee the implementation of the 1953 national budget. Guaranteeing the correct implementation of the national budget must not be regarded as solely the responsibility of the financial departments; all our state organs, business departments, enterprise departments, and the entire people are closely related to the income and expenditure of the national budget to varying degrees, and they must be responsible for the implementation of the national budget. Although our national financial organs bear a special and important responsibility in the process of implementing the national budget, the unity of our national finances is based on the economic and political unity of the state; various enterprises and organs must correctly formulate financial plans, and the financial departments can supervise and manage the financial revenue and expenditure according to these plans. Any irresponsible attitude towards the national budget will affect the implementation of the national budget to varying degrees, either exceeding the budgeted expenditure in one part or reducing the budgeted income in another part, and either way will undermine the national budget. Therefore, the leading organs of party organizations at all levels, people's governments at all levels, financial and economic departments at all levels, trade unions and other organizations at all levels, the leaders of various enterprises, all business managers, and all economic workers must assume very important responsibilities for guaranteeing the implementation of the national budget and must guarantee that the organs, enterprises, and business units under their leadership complete the financial tasks they have undertaken for the national budget; guarantee the timely completion of the national financial collection according to the plan, guarantee the correct use of national funds according to the plan, and guarantee the accumulation of national funds according to the plan.

    The most important positive step to guarantee the implementation of the 1953 national budget is to increase income and reduce all possible expenditures. Only in this way can we have sufficient reserves as a solid guarantee for the budget, which is absolutely indispensable for a large country like ours, especially a large country in the early stages of economic construction and under the threat of American aggression. Comrade Stalin said: "It is necessary to accumulate certain reserves in the hands of the state, which are necessary to prevent the state from suffering any accidents (crop failure), to cultivate industry, to support agriculture, to develop culture, etc. Now we cannot live and work without reserves. Even farmers engaged in small businesses now have to have a certain reserve. Especially a large country with a vast territory and a large population, it is even more necessary to have reserves." ("On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party") Therefore, earnestly taking all methods to increase national income and reduce possible expenditures is our task.

    Increasing income depends first and foremost on increasing the accumulation of state-owned enterprises. In the past, many economic departments underestimated the potential production capacity of state-owned enterprises and the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, which greatly hindered the increase in the accumulation of state-owned enterprises. In 1951, in addition to completing the national plan, the working class in Northeast China increased the production of wealth worth 16 million tons of grain (equivalent to 960 billion yuan); last year, the increase in production and conservation campaign in industrial and mining enterprises in the four regions of North China, Northeast China, East China, and Northwest China created wealth worth more than 2.2 trillion yuan. This proves that the potential of state-owned enterprises is extremely huge. How much wealth is this 2.2 trillion yuan? If it is used for railway construction, it can lay about 25,000 kilometers of track; if it is used to build factories, it can equip 100 spinning mills with 50,000 spindles. We can imagine that if we universally tap the potential and universally increase production in all state-owned enterprises across the country, it will inevitably create a large amount of wealth for the country, which is beyond doubt.

    Of course, the past increase in production targets was generally conditional on relatively backward quotas, and in the future, we will use average advanced quotas as the standard, so it will be more difficult to obtain production and profits exceeding the plan. However, we must see that the situation of state-owned enterprises in various places in tapping potential and implementing advanced quotas is very uneven. The situation in Northeast China and Guannei is different, and the situation in various places in Guannei is also different. In general, rationally adjusting and renovating existing factories, rationally utilizing existing industrial equipment, fully improving the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment, improving labor organization, promoting advanced experience, and improving labor productivity—this series of tasks has hardly begun except in a few areas. On the issue of tapping potential, the tendency of conservatism is still very serious, and this conservative tendency cannot be eliminated by an increase in production campaign for a year or two. It can be seen from this that we must not underestimate the future increase in production campaign, and we must continue to deepen this campaign in all state-owned enterprises. It is estimated that if our various industrial departments can reduce costs by 1 percent in all state-owned industrial enterprises, it can increase national income by 1 trillion yuan; if the three departments of the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Food increase the capital turnover rate from 2.45 times per year to 2.68 times, it can increase national income by 3 trillion yuan; if various state-owned commercial departments can reduce the circulation cost, which accounts for 15.75 percent of the total value of commodities, to 14 percent, it can also relatively increase national income by 3 trillion yuan. This fully shows that there is huge potential in our various economic departments, and as long as we can earnestly strive to increase production, we will greatly increase the accumulation of national funds, and we will definitely be able to guarantee the smooth implementation of the 1953 budget.

    In order to guarantee the implementation of the national budget, we must resolutely eliminate all phenomena of wasting national funds. In the past, our country's various budgets lacked strict review and supervision; many departments used national funds without detailed plans or with plans that were extremely inaccurate; many departments added too many temporary budgets, many of which should not have been spent, should have been spent less, or should have been spent later. All of these caused serious waste.

    According to inspections by many departments, this waste phenomenon is very alarming. The reasons for this waste phenomenon lie not only in the serious bureaucratic work style of the leadership, but also in the errors such as departmentalism, subjective arbitrariness, grandiose ambitions, and conservative backwardness in the thinking of cadres. For example, in order to protect local interests, Suiyuan Province, regardless of the overall situation and without investigating the actual situation, combined with the bureaucratic work style of the responsible department, planned to build a sugar factory. All equipment and machinery had been ordered from abroad and had already begun to be transported when it was discovered that there was insufficient raw material supply, so construction had to be stopped. The construction of the Chengdu Station on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, due to the grandiose ambitions of the personnel involved, designed a large station covering more than 7,000 mu in a city with a population of 750,000, according to the design of a city with a population of 6 million. It was planned to lay 200 kilometers of tracks throughout the station, which is equal to two-fifths of the entire length of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Construction was partially completed before it was stopped. The project on the Ziyang section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway wasted funds equivalent to more than 1,143,000 catties of grain, which is equivalent to the annual harvest of about 4,000 mu of land lost in vain by our farmers under the average yield of 300 catties of grain per mu in ordinary years. The design of the Tongguanshan Copper Smelting Plant in Anhui was discovered to be wrong only after construction began. This design was dominated by conservative and backward ideas, resulting in very low production capacity. Now, using advanced Soviet technical standards to design, the production capacity can be increased to five times the original design. That is to say, according to the backward design, we would have to build four identical copper smelters to抵得上 the role of one plant. Isn't it obvious how much the country's funds would be lost? In state-owned commercial departments, due to the lack of in-depth understanding of market sales conditions, the lack of research on methods for balancing production and sales, and the lack of research on actively opening up sales channels, the national funds accumulated amounted to more than 20 trillion. This amount is almost equal to one-fifth of the total investment in economic construction in our country this year. Can such waste of national funds still be tolerated? According to Chairman Mao's instructions, Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out in the report: "The errors committed in the above aspects are inseparable from the bureaucracy in the leadership. In the future, we must start with severely criticizing bureaucracy and punishing typical bureaucrats to resolutely overcome these errors."

    Now is the time. All the people of our country must rise up and supervise the implementation of the national budget. All the staff of our country must take responsibility to guarantee the implementation of the national budget. Our task is to accurately implement the budget, fully utilize the country's existing economic strength, further develop our potential capacity, seek to increase national income, and strive for frugality in the expenditure and use of national funds, and to do the most with less capital. Only when we have successfully completed this huge task can our country's five-year construction plan get off to a good start.

### 为保证实现一九五三年的国家预算而斗争

    为保证实现一九五三年的国家预算而斗争
    中央人民政府委员会第二十三次会议通过的“关于一九五三年国家预算的报告”，已于昨日公布了。它全面地总结了三年来我国财政经济状况的变化，生动地反映了我国国民经济今后一年的发展和人民的物质和文化生活进一步增长的计划。保证实现一九五三年的国家预算，也就是保证实现一九五三年国家建设计划的重要环节，这是全国人民的重大的政治任务。
    在以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家制度之下，在以社会主义性质的国营经济为领导力量的优越的经济制度之下，我国工人和农民的劳动热情日益充分地发挥起来，各项经济事业都有了迅速的恢复和发展。我们的工农业生产，除了其中少数几个项目以外，大多数项目都已恢复并超过解放前的最高水平。因此，我们的国家就能够一方面集中必要的资金，用以不断扩大生产，增加社会财富，巩固国防，提高人民的物质和文化生活；另一方面，又在经济迅速恢复和发展的基础上，逐年地增加国家的资金积累，使我们有可能开始第一个五年建设计划。如以我国一九五○年的收支各为一百，那末，一九五三年我们国家的收入就达到了三百三十六点二九，支出达到了三百四十二点九七。我们国家预算的增长，反映了我国经济健康发展的状况，说明了我们国家财政状况乃是基础巩固的和不断进步的，我们国家预算的方针是完全正确的。而我们国家预算的任务，就是用一切方法保证国家经济建设和文化建设的发展、保证巩固国防的需要。在一九五三年的总预算中，除国防经费以外，国民经济建设的支出占百分之四十四点三四，比一九五二年增加三十万零四千多亿元；社会文教建设的支出占百分之一十四点九，比一九五二年增多十二万四千七百五十亿元。在国民经济建设中，又以工业特别是重工业占首要地位。这表现了我们国家财政支出的原则，就是要集中使用国家的资金，用来发展最有决定意义的工业。这是完全符合于国家工业化的利益的，是完全符合于我国人民的根本利益的。在国家的各项收入中，国营企业和合作社所交纳的利润和税款，从一九五○年占国家总收入的百分之三十四点零八，增至一九五三年的百分之五十九点七九。这就表现了我们国家的财政收入，已经日益明显地主要依靠于工人阶级的创造性的劳动，依靠于国营企业的增加生产、提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本和提高企业利润。这个事实，生动地证明了工人阶级和社会主义性质的国营经济在我国是起着怎样伟大的领导作用。
    我们的国家预算已经通过了。它表现着我们的国家和人民的不屈不挠的意志，就是要在现时我国财政经济全面恢复的基础上，坚决地争取我国五年计划的建设在第一年的伟大胜利。编制这个预算的根据，就是我国一九五三年的工业基本建设和工业生产将有显著的发展，农业和水利建设事业将有新的巨大的发展，文化教育事业也将有重要的发展。这就将给予我国人民以巨大的利益。因此，我国人民必须以最大的关心，来监督国家的财政经济机关和一切国营企业部门以及各种业务部门对国家预算执行的情况，必须以最大的努力，来为保证实现一九五三年的国家预算而斗争。保证国家预算的正确执行，决不能认为只是财政部门的事情；所有我们的国家机关、业务部门、企业部门以及全体人民，都在不同的程度上和国家预算的收支发生密切的关系，他们就都要对国家预算的执行情况负责。虽然，我们国家的财政机关在执行国家预算的过程中负有特殊的重大责任，但是我们国家财政的统一是建立在国家的经济和政治统一的基础之上的；各企业和各机关必须正确地制订了财务计划，财政部门才能按照这些计划从财政收支上去加以监督和管理。任何对国家预算采取不负责任的态度，都会在各种不同的程度上影响国家预算的执行，或者是在这一部分突破了预算支出的数目，或者是在那一部分削减了预算收入的数目，而无论是这样或那样，结果都会破坏国家的预算。因此，各级党的组织、各级人民政府、各级财政经济部门、各级工会的和其他团体的领导机关、各企业单位的领导人员、一切业务管理人员、一切经济工作人员，对于保证执行国家预算都必须负起非常重大的责任，都必须保证自己所领导的机关、企业和业务单位，完成它们对国家预算所承担的财政任务；保证按照计划及时地完成国家的财政征收，保证按照计划正确使用国家的资金，保证按照计划积累国家的资金。
    保证实现一九五三年的国家预算的最重要的积极步骤，就是增加收入和节减一切可以节减的开支。只有这样，我们才可以有充足的后备作为预算的巩固保证，这种保证是像我们这样一个大国，特别是处在经济建设初期和美国侵略威胁下的大国，所绝对不可缺少的。斯大林同志说过：“需要在国家手中积蓄一定的后备，这种后备是为防备国家遭受任何意外（歉收），为培植工业、为扶助农业、为发展文化等等所必需的。现在没有后备便不能生活和工作。甚至从事小经营的农民现在都非有一定的储备不可。尤其是一个地广人多的大国，那就更非有后备不可了。”（“论苏联经济状况和党的政策”）因此，认真采取一切方法来增加国家的收入和节减可以节减的开支，这就是我们的任务。
    增加收入首先依靠增加国营企业的积累。过去许多经济部门对国营企业生产的潜在能力和工人群众的积极性和创造性估计不足，这就大大妨碍了国营企业积累的增加。东北工人阶级在一九五一年完成国家计划以外，增产了价值一千六百万吨粮食（折合九万六千亿元）的财富；去年华北、东北、华东、西北四个区的工矿企业的增产节约运动，创造了价值二十二万多亿元的财富。这就证明了国营企业的潜在力是极其巨大的。就以这二十二万亿元来说，这是多大的财富呢？把它用在铁路建设方面，这就可以铺设约二万五千公里的铁轨；把它用来建设工厂，这就可以装配五万纱锭的纺纱厂一百个。我们可以想见，在全国所有的国营企业中，普遍挖掘潜力，普遍增产的结果，必将为国家创造出大量的财富，这是决无疑义的。
    当然，过去的增产指标，一般地是以比较落后的定额为条件的，今后我们要以平均的先进定额为标准，因此，要获得超过计划的生产和利润就要困难些。但是，我们必须看到，各地国营企业挖掘潜力和实行先进定额的情况是很不平衡的。东北和关内的情形有所不同，关内各地的情形也有所不同。总的说来，合理地调整和改建现有的工厂，合理地利用现有的工业设备，充分地提高现有机器设备利用率，改善劳动组织，推广先进经验，提高劳动生产率，这一系列的工作除少数地区外还简直没有开始。在挖掘潜力的这个问题上，保守主义的倾向还是十分严重地存在着，这种保守主义倾向决不是经过一年两年的增产运动就可以打掉。由此可见，我们对于今后的增产运动决不能估计过低，我们还必须在一切国营企业中继续深入推广这个运动。据估计，我们的各个工业部门，如果在所有的国营工业企业中做到降低成本百分之一，就可以为国家增加收入一万亿元；商业部、对外贸易部、粮食部三个部门，如果把资金周转率由每年的二点四五次提高到二点六八次，就可以为国家增加收入三万亿元；各个国营商业部门，如果能把占商品总值百分之十五点七五的流转费用减少到百分之十四，也可以相对地为国家增加收入三万亿元。这就充分说明了我们的各个经济部门，都存在着巨大的潜在力量，只要我们能够认真努力增加生产，就会大大地增加国家的资金积累，我们就一定可以保证一九五三年预算的顺利执行。
    为了保证实现国家预算，我们必须坚决地消灭一切浪费国家资金的现象。过去我们国家的各项预算还缺乏严格的审查和监督；许多部门使用国家资金没有详密的计划或有计划而极不准确；许多部门临时追加的预算太多，其中有很多是不应该开支的、应该少开支的、应该迟开支的。这些都造成了严重的浪费。
    据许多部门的检查，这种浪费现象是非常惊人的。造成这种浪费现象的原因，不但在于领导上严重的官僚主义作风，而且也在于干部思想上的本位主义、主观武断、好大喜功、保守落后等等错误。例如绥远省为了地方的利益，不顾全局，又不调查实际情况，和主管部门的官僚主义作风结合起来，就计划建设一座制糖厂，全部设备和机器都已经向国外订妥，并且已经开始运来机器了，才发现原料来源不足，只好停止修建。成渝铁路成都车站的建筑，由于有关人员好大喜功，在现有七十五万人口的城市中，却按六百万人口的城市来设计一个占地七千多亩的大车站，拟在全站铺轨二百公里，等于成渝路全长五分之二，已经部分施工才被停止了。成渝路资阳段的工程，浪费了约值一百十四万三千多斤粮食的资金，这就等于我国农民在普通年成平均每亩打三百斤粮食的情形下，白白地丢掉了约四千亩土地全年的收获量。安徽铜官山炼铜厂的设计，在开始施工之后才被发现是错误的。这个设计因为受了保守落后思想的支配，以致生产能力很低，现在采取苏联先进的技术标准来设计，生产能力可以比原来的设计增加到五倍。这就是说，按照落后的设计，我们就要再建设四个相同的炼铜厂，才抵得了一个厂的作用。这要使国家资金受到多大的损失，不是显而易见的吗？在国营商业部门，由于不深入了解市场销售的情况，不研究产销平衡的办法，不研究积极打开销路的办法，以致积压国家资金达二十万亿以上。这个数目几乎等于今年我国经济建设全部投资的五分之一。这样浪费国家的资金，难道还能够容忍吗？根据毛主席的指示，薄一波同志在报告中指出：“上述各方面所犯的错误，是与领导上的官僚主义分不开的。今后必须从严厉地批判官僚主义和惩办典型的官僚主义分子入手，去坚决地克服这些错误。”
    现在是时候了。我们全国人民都要起来，监督国家预算的执行。我们国家的所有工作人员都要负起责任来保证实现国家的预算。我们大家的任务就是要准确地执行预算，充分地利用国家现有的经济力量，进一步发挥我们的潜在能力，求得国家收入的增加，而在国家资金的开支和使用上就要力求节约，要用较少的本钱作出最多的事情。只有当我们胜利地完成了这个巨大任务的时候，我们的国家建设五年计划才能得到一个良好的开端。
