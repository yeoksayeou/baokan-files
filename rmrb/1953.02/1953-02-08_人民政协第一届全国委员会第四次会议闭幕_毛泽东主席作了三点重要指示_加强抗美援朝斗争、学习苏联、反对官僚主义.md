    The First Session of the Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Closes
    Chairman Mao Zedong Gives Three Important Instructions
    Strengthen the Struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Learn from the Soviet Union, and Oppose Bureaucracy

    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] The First Session of the Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its final meeting this afternoon and closed victoriously at 5:30 PM.

    The following members spoke at the 7th meeting: Dong Biwu, Ma Yinchu, and Liang Xi. An Ziwen, Minister of Personnel of the Central People's Government and Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting entitled "We Must Launch a Resolute Struggle Against Bureaucracy, Commandism, and Violations of Law and Discipline Throughout the Country and in All Levels of Organs."

    The meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Political Report," the "Resolution on the Work Report of the Standing Committee," and the "Resolution on Supporting the Various Demands of the World People's Peace Congress."

    After hearing the report on the examination of proposals made by Zhang Naiqi, convener of the Proposal Examination Committee, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Report on the Examination of Proposals."

    The meeting elected 23 additional members to the Standing Committee of the First National Committee.

    The meeting passed a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Before the close of the meeting, Chairman Mao Zedong delivered an important speech amidst warm applause.

    Chairman Mao pointed out that this meeting, as well as the reports, discussions, and resolutions of the meeting, were all very good. After congratulating the meeting on its success, Chairman Mao gave three instructions.

    First, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Because US imperialism insists on detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, sabotaging the armistice negotiations, and attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea must continue to be strengthened. We want peace, but as long as US imperialism does not abandon its barbaric and unreasonable demands and its conspiracy to expand aggression, the Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Korean people until the end. This is not because we are bellicose. We are willing to stop the war immediately, and the remaining issues can be resolved in the future. But US imperialism is unwilling to do so, then so be it, let's fight on. US imperialism is willing to fight for how many years, we are prepared to fight with him for how many years, until US imperialism is willing to give up, until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory.

    Second, we must learn from the Soviet Union. We want to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is within the Communist Party or outside the Communist Party, old cadres, new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, workers, or peasants, all must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country.

    Third, we must oppose bureaucracy in our leading organs and among our leading cadres at all levels. At present, there are very serious phenomena of commandism and violations of law and discipline in many grassroots organizations and among grassroots cadres. The occurrence and growth of this phenomenon are inseparable from the bureaucracy of leading organs and leading cadres. Taking even the central-level organs as an example, many leading cadres in many departments are still only satisfied with sitting in their offices writing resolutions and issuing instructions, only paying attention to arranging work, and not paying attention to going deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and inspect work, so that their leadership often becomes detached from the masses and detached from reality, resulting in many serious problems in their work. If we want to carry out large-scale national construction, we must overcome bureaucracy and maintain close ties with the people. Leading cadres at all levels, both central and local, should frequently go deep into the grassroots to inspect work. If leading organs and leading cadres overcome bureaucracy, those bad phenomena of commandism and violations of law and discipline below will certainly be overcome as well. If these problems are eliminated, our national planned construction will surely succeed, the people's democratic system will surely develop, the imperialists' conspiracies will surely fail, and we will surely be able to achieve complete victory!

    人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议闭幕
    毛泽东主席作了三点重要指示
    加强抗美援朝斗争、学习苏联、反对官僚主义
    【新华社七日讯】中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议七日下午举行最后一次大会，并在下午五时半胜利闭幕。
    在七日大会上发言的有：董必武委员，马寅初委员，梁希委员。中央人民政府人事部部长、中共中央组织部副部长安子文在大会上作了“我们必须在全国范围内和各级机关中开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的坚决斗争”的发言。
    会议一致通过“关于政治报告的决议”、“关于常务委员会会务报告的决议”、“关于支持世界人民和平大会各项要求的决议”。
    会议在听取了提案审查委员会召集人章乃器委员所作的关于提案审查的报告后，一致通过了“关于提案审查报告的决议”。
    会议增选了第一届全国委员会常务委员二十三人。
    会议通过致中国人民志愿军电。
    会议闭幕前，毛泽东主席在热烈的掌声中作了重要讲话。
    毛主席指出这次会议以及会议的报告、讨论和决议都是很好的。毛主席在祝贺会议的成功之后，作了三点指示。
    第一、要加强抗美援朝的斗争。由于美帝国主义坚持扣留中朝战俘，破坏停战谈判，并且妄图扩大侵朝战争，所以，抗美援朝的斗争必须继续加强。我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战，剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好罢，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。
    第二、要学习苏联。我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。
    第三、要在我们各级领导机关和领导干部中反对官僚主义。现在在不少基层组织和基层干部中存在着很严重的命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，这种现象的发生和滋长，是与领导机关和领导干部的官僚主义分不开的。即以中央一级机关来说，许多部门中的许多领导干部，还仅仅满足于坐在机关中写决议，发指示，只注意布置工作，而不注意深入下层去了解情况和检查工作，使自己的领导常常脱离群众和脱离实际，以致在工作中发生了不少的严重问题。我们要进行大规模的国家建设，就必须克服官僚主义，密切联系人民群众。中央和地方各级领导干部都应该经常地深入下层，检查工作。如果领导机关和领导干部克服了官僚主义，下面那些命令主义和违法乱纪的坏现象，也一定会得到克服的。这些毛病都去掉了，我们的国家计划建设就一定会成功，人民民主制度就一定会发展，帝国主义的阴谋就一定会失败，我们就一定能够取得完全的胜利！
