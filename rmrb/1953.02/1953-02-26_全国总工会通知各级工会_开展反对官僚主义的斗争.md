Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on launching a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline within the trade union system. The full text is as follows:

The phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline are also common, and even serious, in trade union organizations at all levels. These phenomena hinder the development of trade union work, hinder the relationship between trade unions and the masses, and thus hinder the correct implementation of the Communist Party's various policies. Therefore, it is very necessary to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in trade union organizations.

Trade union organizations at all levels must launch this struggle under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the local Party committee. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the national committees of various industrial trade unions will not make separate deployments. However, higher-level trade union organizations can and should assist local Party committees in correctly carrying out this struggle in lower-level trade union organizations. The materials revealed and the improvement measures proposed by trade union organizations at all levels in this struggle must be reported in detail to the higher-level trade union, and trade unions above the provincial and municipal levels should summarize and report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

In this struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, trade union organizations at all levels must fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, fully expose the mistakes and shortcomings of our trade union organizations, and, through this struggle, combined with the study of the "May 3rd" Factory experience, grasp the effective methods of establishing a democratic work style and a mass line for trade unions, and truly place trade union work under the supervision of the masses. Trade union organizations must not only thoroughly expose and correct the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline within the trade unions themselves, but also have the responsibility to help administrative departments expose and correct these errors.

    全国总工会通知各级工会
    开展反对官僚主义的斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】中华全国总工会发出在工会系统开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的通知。全文如下：
    在各级工会组织中，官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，也是普遍的，甚至是严重的。这些现象，妨碍着工会工作的开展，妨碍着工会与群众的关系，因而也就妨碍着共产党的各种政策的正确贯彻。因此在工会组织中开展一个反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，是十分必要的。
    各级工会组织必须在当地党委统一领导和统一布置下，展开这一斗争。全国总工会、各产业工会全国委员会不做单独布置。但上级工会组织，可以而且应该协助地方党委把下级工会组织的这一斗争正确地开展起来。各级工会组织在这一斗争中所揭发的材料和提出的改进办法，必须向上级工会做详细报告，省、市以上工会应汇总报告全国总工会。
    各级工会组织，在此次反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争中，必须充分发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，把我们工会组织的错误与缺点充分揭发出来，经过这次斗争，结合学习“五三”工厂经验，掌握确实树立工会的民主作风和群众路线的工作方法，把工会工作确实放在群众监督之下。工会组织不但要把工会本身的官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的现象彻底揭发与纠正，而且有责任帮助行政管理部门揭发和纠正这些错误。
