Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 27th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, fighting heroically to ensure the smooth operation of railways in North Korea, has seen the emergence of a large number of meritorious servants and model workers. Together with the Korean railway workers and the Korean-Chinese air defense forces, they have turned the North Korean railway line into an unbreakable steel transportation line.

　　The U.S. invading army's air force tried every means to destroy the North Korean railways, attempting to cut off supplies to the Korean and Chinese forces. According to incomplete statistics, the U.S. air force has made more than 127,000 sorties attacking North Korean railways in the past two years, dropping more than 160,000 bombs, totaling more than 40,000 tons. One-third of these were time bombs. Near a railway bridge in North Korea, more than 20,000 bombs have fallen in the past two years. However, despite this frenzied destruction by the enemy, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, along with Korean railway workers and the Korean-Chinese air defense forces, resolutely ensured the smooth operation of the railways, defeating the enemy's conspiracy. They increased the operating railway lines in North Korea at the end of 1952 by ten and a half times compared to the winter of 1950. This not only guaranteed sufficient supplies of food and ammunition to the front lines, but also enabled the completion of North Korea's national economic transportation plan. This forced the enemy to exclaim that the Korean and Chinese people "with indomitable efforts continue to transport supplies on the railway," demonstrating "unbelievable skill and determination."

　　In the arduous struggle of the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps has displayed a high degree of tenacity and creativity, greatly improving its technical level and gaining rich experience in the struggle against enemy aircraft and nature. For example, the famous "Yang Lian’di Company," led by the martyr Yang Lian’di, fought battles in areas such as the Yalu River, the Chongchon River, and the Taedong River, completing many difficult bridge-building tasks. Guo Jinsheng, a special-class meritorious worker of a certain unit, dismantled 603 time bombs (of more than 40 types) with a high degree of self-sacrifice, extracting 27 tons of explosives, not only eliminating danger and protecting the lines, but also saving the country more than 160 million yuan in wealth. The Ninth Company of a certain unit, which was awarded the collective second-class merit, guarded a bridge that was heavily bombed by enemy aircraft. They promptly repaired the damaged parts and fought continuously for 76 days and nights. Although enemy aircraft dropped more than 7,000 bombs, they still ensured regular traffic and created a record of erecting an I-beam in just six minutes. The communications company of a certain unit, which was awarded the collective second-class merit, traversed North Korea, repairing communication lines more than 10,000 times under the threat of enemy aircraft and artillery, in uninhabited primeval forests and on towering mountains more than 1,000 meters above sea level, extending the lines by more than 5,000 kilometers. Han Futang, a line worker of a certain unit, invented the "I-beam controller," which greatly reduced the danger of bridge construction, shortened working time by half, and saved two-thirds of the manpower. Qi Guozhen, deputy company commander of the Ninth Company of a certain unit, created the "universal track gauge," which greatly improved work efficiency. The engineering section of a certain unit created a new method when repairing a bridge, saving 5,000 man-hours and 60 freight cars of engineering materials, and completing the task in half the time. Peng Naijiu of a certain unit created the "bottle screw wrench," which quadrupled the efficiency of tightening screws.

　　In the past two years, the Volunteer Army Railway Corps has seen the emergence of 167 collective meritorious units and 7,919 meritorious workers and model workers in the struggle against enemy bombing and natural difficulties. Among them, 2,434 are members of the Communist Party of China, and 1,497 are members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Among the meritorious personnel, 4,256 have been awarded the National Flag Medal, the Freedom and Independence Medal, and the Military Merit Medal by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　In early February this year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps held a celebration meeting. The 221 meritorious representatives who attended the meeting, as well as representatives from railway transportation departments and anti-aircraft artillery units, firmly expressed their determination to intensify the struggle and ensure "smooth railway transportation and sufficient supply of materials" under any difficult circumstances, striving for the great victory of 1953.

    把北朝鲜铁路变成了炸不断的钢铁运输线
    志愿军铁道部队涌现大批功臣模范
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军铁道部队，在保卫北朝鲜铁路运输畅通的斗争中英勇奋战，涌现了大批功臣模范，他们和朝鲜铁路员工与朝中防空部队，共同把北朝鲜铁路线变成一条炸不断的钢铁运输线。
    美国侵略军空军曾千方百计地破坏北朝鲜铁路，妄图截断朝中部队的供应。仅据不完全统计，两年多以来美国空军袭击北朝鲜铁路线的飞机达十二万七千多架次，投弹十六万多枚，约四万多吨。其中三分之一为定时炸弹。北朝鲜某处的一座铁路大桥的附近，两年来即落弹两万多枚。但是，就在敌人这种疯狂破坏的情况下，中国人民志愿军铁道部队，和朝鲜铁路员工及朝中防空部队，坚决地保证了铁路运输的畅通，打败了敌人的阴谋。他们使一九五二年年底北朝鲜铁路的通车线路比一九五零年冬增加了十倍半。不仅保证了前线粮弹充足，并且还能完成朝鲜国民经济运输计划。这使敌人也不得不惊呼朝中人民“以不屈不挠的努力使供应品继续在铁路上运送”，表现了“不可思议的技巧和决心”。
    在两年多来的艰难斗争中，中国人民志愿军的铁道部队发挥了高度的顽强性和创造性，大大地提高了自己的技术水平，并在与敌机和自然界的斗争中取得了丰富的经验。如著名的“杨连第连”，曾在杨连第烈士带领下转战鸭绿江、清川江、大同江等地，完成了许多艰巨的架桥任务。某部特等功臣郭金声，以高度自我牺牲的精神拆卸了六百零三颗定时炸弹（共四十多种）取出炸药二十七吨，不但排除了危险，保护了线路，并且为国家节省了一亿六千多万元的财富。某部荣立集体二等功的第九连守护着遭受敌机重点轰炸的一座桥梁，他们及时修复被破坏的部分，连续战斗七十六昼夜，虽然敌机投弹达七千多枚，仍保证了经常通车，并创造了六分钟架好一片工字梁的最高纪录。某部荣立集体二等功的通讯连，足迹踏遍了北朝鲜，在敌机敌炮的威胁下，在没有人迹的原始森林中和拔海千余公尺的丛山峻岭上，抢修通讯线路一万次以上，延长线路五千多公里。某部线路工人韩福堂发明了“工字梁管制器”，大大减少了架桥中的危险，并缩短工作时间一半，节省人力三分之二。某部九连副连长齐国珍创造了“万能道尺”大大地提高了工作效率。某部工程科，在修复一座桥梁时创造了新的办法，节省了五千个人工、六十节车皮的工程材料，并提前一半时间完成了任务。某部彭耐久创造了“瓶螺丝扳子”，使拧螺丝的效率提高了四倍。
    两年以来，志愿军铁道部队在与敌机轰炸及自然界困难的斗争中，已涌现一百六十七个集体立功单位，七千九百一十九名功臣和工作模范。其中有二千四百三十四人是中国共产党党员，一千四百九十七人是中国新民主主义青年团团员。在立功人员中，还有四千二百五十六人分别荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁发的国旗勋章、自由独立勋章和军功章。
    在今年二月上旬，中国人民志愿军铁道部队举行了庆功大会，参加大会的二百二十一位功臣代表以及铁道运输部门、高射炮部队的代表都坚决表示要更加紧斗争，保证在任何艰难情况下都做到“铁道运输畅通，供应物资充足”，争取一九五三年的伟大胜利。
