    Taiyuan's suburban rural areas, under the policy of serving urban industrial construction, have both met the growing needs of urban construction and achieved significant development themselves over the past three years. In the early days of Taiyuan's liberation, the Communist Party's suburban district committee did not clearly recognize the policy that suburban rural areas must serve urban construction and simply focused on developing agriculture for its own sake. Agricultural production could not meet the needs of urban construction. For example, while urban construction needed wheat straw and wheat bran, many farmers in the suburbs burned it in the fields. The city needed sorghum stalks, but suburban farmers used them to make fertilizer. Some land in villages like Nanyan and Gucheng Ying had already been designated for factory use, but rural work cadres were still establishing agricultural production cooperatives there. After experiencing setbacks in many places, leading cadres gradually realized that suburban production could only have greater prospects by serving industrial and urban construction. This could not only increase farmers' incomes, enabling them to engage in agricultural infrastructure construction and achieve greater agricultural success, but also strongly support urban infrastructure construction and consolidate the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance.

    To green the city and improve urban sanitation, Taiyuan's suburban rural areas have begun large-scale tree planting and afforestation. In 1952 alone, 5,661 mu of barren hills were sown, 593 mu of cooperative afforestation was carried out, 112 mu of nurseries were established, 500 mu of general trees were planted, and 130,000 apple and grape trees were planted. Large-scale protective forest belt construction has begun along the 70-li long and 100-meter wide area on both sides of the Fen River. Last year, the afforestation plan of 580 mu was completed in the northern part. To supply factories and rural areas with water, suburban areas have invested even more manpower and resources in water conservancy construction. The construction of the east and west trunk canals of the Fen River has begun, and the first phase of the project has now been completed. To ensure that urban people have vegetables to eat, suburban farmers put forward the slogan "Evergreen in All Seasons" and began to grow vegetables in large quantities. According to incomplete statistics in the autumn of 1952, suburban areas planted a total of 15,000 mu of vegetables, producing 68 million jin of vegetables, fully meeting the city's requirements. The suburbs increased by 18,000 pigs, 18,500 sheep, and 109,900 chickens and ducks, and also piloted two fish ponds, which will produce 200,000 jin of fresh fish this year, further meeting the city's needs for meat, eggs, and other non-staple foods. Over the past three years, Taiyuan's suburbs have supplied a large number of materials for industrial and infrastructure construction. According to preliminary statistics, the entire suburbs organized 15 brick and tile kilns and 163 lime kilns, supplying more than 23.52 million bricks, 444,000 tiles, and 136,442,000 jin of lime. To meet the needs of infrastructure construction, the suburbs developed the transportation industry. In 1952, the entire suburbs had more than 2,200 rubber-wheeled carts and professional transportation carts, transporting a large amount of raw materials for urban construction and infrastructure construction. To facilitate transportation, the suburbs vigorously repaired roads and bridges, mobilized militiamen to protect the roads, and ensured the safety of highway transportation. In addition, Taiyuan's suburbs systematically transferred 17,000 farmers to factories. All of this shows that all the work in the suburbs starts from supporting the city and building the city, directly and indirectly serving industrial and infrastructure construction.

    Since suburban agricultural and sideline production serves the city, farmers' incomes have increased, and farmers have more power to invest in the land. Therefore, over the past three years, agriculture in Taiyuan's suburbs has made great progress. In 1952, the total agricultural output exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by 22 percent. The entire suburbs have organized 2,910 mutual aid teams, and 40 percent of the labor force has participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. The city has provided great support to rural areas in terms of new agricultural tools. According to incomplete statistics, over the past three years, the city has supplied farmers with more than 1,350 new-style waterwheels and new-style agricultural tools such as seven-inch plows, sprayers, and rice threshers. This has greatly improved agricultural technology and the scientific thinking of the masses. The material and cultural life of suburban farmers has also been fundamentally improved. The suffering of the broad masses of working people who lacked food and clothing under the rule of the Yan bandits has long disappeared. The vast majority of working people are now living a prosperous life with three meals a day, cotton clothes in winter, and single clothes in summer. The entire suburbs has 27,144 children enrolled in school, and 11,444 adults enrolled in literacy classes or winter schools.

    Over the past three years, the serious shortcomings in Taiyuan's suburban work are the unbalanced development of work, the leadership's "doing everything at once" style, the narrow-minded and conservative thinking of many cadres, and the serious coercive command style of a few cadres. These shortcomings and errors must be overcome, otherwise, we will not be able to better mobilize farmers to support urban construction and infrastructure construction. (Zhang Dezhù)

    太原市郊农民大力支援城市工业建设
    太原市郊区农村在为城市工业建设服务的方针下，三年来既满足了城市建设日益发展的需要，本身又有很大的发展。在太原解放初期，中共郊区委员会并未明确认识郊区农村必须为城市建设服务的方针，还是单纯为发展农业而发展农业，农业生产不能适应城市建设的需要。如城市建设需要麦秸、麦糠，郊区不少农民却在野地里把麦秸、麦糠烧掉了。城市需要高粱杆，郊区农民却用它来沤粪；南堰、古城营等村的一部分土地本来已划为工厂用地，农村工作干部还在那里成立农业生产合作社。由于在不少地方碰了钉子，领导干部逐渐认识了郊区生产只有为工业建设和城市建设服务，才有更大的发展前途的道理。因为这样既可增加农民的收入，使他们能够从事农业基本建设，使农业生产获得更大的成就；又能有力地支援城市的基本建设，巩固工农联盟和城乡互助的基础。
    为了绿化城市，改善城市卫生环境，太原郊区农村已开始大量植树造林。只一九五二年即在荒山播种五千六百六十一亩，合作造林五百九十三亩，建立了苗圃一百一十二亩，种植一般树木五百亩，植苹果葡萄十三万株。汾河两岸七十里长一百公尺宽的地方，已开始了大规模的防护林带建设，去年已在北部完成了五百八十亩的造林计划。为了供给工厂和农村用水，郊区在水利建设上用的人力物力更大。汾河东西大干渠的建设已开始，现在已完成了第一段的工程。为了保证城市人民有菜吃，郊区农民提出“四季常青”的口号，开始大量种菜。根据一九五二年秋季不完全的统计，郊区共种菜一万五千亩，生产六千八百万斤菜，全部满足了城市的要求。郊区增加了一万八千口猪、一万八千五百只羊、十万九千九百只鸡鸭，并试办了两个养鱼池，今年即能出产二十万斤鲜鱼，进一步满足城市的肉类、蛋类等副食品的需要。三年来太原市郊区大批供给了工业建设和基本建设所用的材料。据初步统计全郊区共组织了十五座砖瓦窑，一百六十三座石灰窑，供给了二千三百五十二万余块砖，四十四万四千块瓦，一亿三千六百四十四万二千斤石灰。为了适应基本建设的需要，郊区发展了运输业。一九五二年全郊区共有二千二百余辆胶皮车和专业运输皮车，为城市建设和基本建设运输了大量的原材料。为了运输方便，郊区大力整修了道路和桥梁，发动民兵保路护路，保证了公路运输的安全。此外，太原郊区还有计划有组织地输送了一万七千个农民转入工厂。所有这一切，都说明了郊区的各项工作都是从支援城市、建设城市出发，直接和间接地服务于工业建设和基本建设的。
    郊区农副业生产既然为城市服务，农民的收入就增加了，农民更有力量向土地上投资。因此，三年来太原市郊区的农业已有了很大的发展。一九五二年农业总产量已超过战前最高年产量的百分之二十二。全郊区已组织了二千九百一十个互助组，百分之四十的劳力参加了互助组和农业生产合作社。城市在新式农具等方面给予农村以极大的支援。据不完全统计，三年以来，城市已供给了农民一千三百五十余部新式水车，和七寸步犁、喷雾器、打稻机等新式农具。这就大大提高了农业技术水平和群众的科学思想。郊区农民的物质生活和文化生活也有了根本改善。在阎匪统治下所造成的广大劳动人民缺衣无食的苦境，早已没有了，绝大多数的劳动人民已过着一日三餐、冬有棉、夏有单的丰衣足食的生活。全郊区已有二万七千一百四十四个儿童入了学，一万一千四百四十四个成年人入了速成识字班或冬学。
    三年来，太原郊区工作的严重缺点，是工作发展不平衡，领导方面存在着一揽子作风，许多干部还有狭隘保守思想，以及少数干部的严重的强迫命令作风。这些缺点和错误必须克服，否则就不能更好地发动农民支援城市建设和基本建设。（张德助）
