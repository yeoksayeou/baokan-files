Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 21st—Recently, another group of POWs who were forced by the U.S. side to join the Li Seung-man puppet army fell into our hands. They testified that while the U.S. deliberately interrupted the armistice negotiations in October last year, it secretly transferred 11,000 POWs to the Li Seung-man gang under the guise of "release," forcing them to serve as cannon fodder. Adding this to the 27,000 POWs handed over to the Li gang by the U.S. in July last year, the total number of POWs forced by the U.S. to serve as cannon fodder has reached at least 38,000.

The experiences of Li Xuexiu and Jin Hengzhi, who were forced to join the Li puppet army, demonstrate the full extent of the U.S. conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs. Li Xuexiu and Jin Hengzhi are both from Seoul. They joined the Korean People's Army in August 1950 and were captured in October of the same year, being detained in the 84th camp and 71st camp of the U.S. Koje Island POW camp, respectively. Their detention numbers were 39680 and 71694.

According to Li Xuexiu: in February last year, U.S. and Li secret agents conducted a large-scale and violent "screening" of POWs in the 84th camp. They forced POWs to undergo "individual interrogation." When POWs firmly demanded repatriation to their homeland, the U.S. and Li secret agents would write the English letter "GO" on the forms given to the POWs. This was actually a signal to order the secret agents to carry out beatings. When the POWs walked out the door, pre-arranged Li gang secret agents would swarm up and beat the POWs with clubs and whips. Many POWs were also subjected to electric shock torture. After the POWs were injured, the POW hospital refused to admit them. Many POWs died from their serious injuries. By the end of May, the U.S. side transferred the POWs to the Masan POW camp on the Korean mainland, preparing to hand them over to the Li gang. In the Masan POW camp, the POWs were dispersed and detained in many small camps, making it easier for the U.S. side to implement a reign of terror. The U.S. and Li bandit troops established many regulations that violated the Geneva Convention, such as "singing is forbidden" and "speaking together in groups of more than three is forbidden," and used the pretext that the POWs violated these regulations to arbitrarily beat them to death or injure them. The Li bandit special police guard team frequently searched the POWs' residences without warning, arbitrarily arresting POWs and subjecting them to torture. POWs loyal to their homeland were constantly murdered by Li gang secret agents. In order to cover up these horrific facts, Van Fleet ordered a ban on reporters visiting POW camps on the Korean mainland, including the Masan POW camp.

From October 6th last year, 11,000 POWs in the Masan POW camp were "released" in seven batches. Li Xuexiu and Jin Hengzhi were both "released" in the sixth batch on October 25th. Li Xuexiu said that before the "release," U.S. and Li secret agents forced the POWs to join the reactionary organization "Destroy Communism Comrades Association" and forced them to swear an oath to join the Li puppet army. After they were escorted to Yeongdeungpo, an American Major General spoke to them, openly threatening them with prison sentences if they did not join the Li puppet army. Then, they were handed over to the Seoul Police Department, forced to register and receive "Second National Army Registration Certificates." Not long after they "returned home," the police station forced them to undergo physical examinations. The Li bandit special police officers constantly threatened them to enlist in the army, and told them that the 27,000 POWs who were handed over to the Li gang by the U.S. in July last year under the same guise of "release" had all been drafted into the Li puppet army. Li Xuexiu saw that there was no way to avoid joining the army, but in order to avoid becoming a combat soldier, he went to register at the U.S. military "Labor Service Office." However, this organization was nominally "recruiting odd-job workers," but was actually a special agency for the U.S. military to collect cannon fodder. Li Xuexiu was sent by the "Labor Service Office" to the "HID," a special agency under the Li puppet army's Army Headquarters, for short-term training, and then he was added to the Li puppet army.

Jin Hengzhi was also sent by the "Labor Service Office" to the "TLO," a special agency under the U.S. Marine Corps First Division, to serve as a special agent. However, the way he was forced to join the army was different from that of Li Xuexiu. Because Jin Hengzhi was older than the age for open conscription by the Li Seung-man gang, the Li bandit special agents used the excuse that he had no occupation to threaten to arrest him. In fact, the police station had long forbidden all industries from hiring or taking in POWs. Jin Hengzhi had no way out and had to fall into the trap of the "Labor Service Office." Li Xuexiu and Jin Hengzhi both said that during their training, the U.S. and Li secret agents often intimidated them and forbade them from revealing their POW identities.

These facts once again prove that the reason why the U.S. insisted on the absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" to undermine the armistice negotiations is that they are determined to hand over the POWs to the Li Seung-man gang to serve as cannon fodder, in order to realize their criminal conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians."

### 我方所获人证再度证明美方强迫大批战俘充当李伪军炮灰

    我方所获人证再度证明美方强迫大批战俘充当李伪军炮灰
    【新华社开城二十一日电】最近又有一批被美方强迫参加李承晚伪军的战俘落在我方手中，他们证明美方在去年十月间有计划中断停战谈判的同时，把一万一千名战俘以“释放”为名秘密移交给了李承晚匪帮，强迫他们充当炮灰。如果加上去年七月间美方移交给李匪帮的战俘二万七千名，则被美方强迫充当炮灰的战俘，总数至少已达三万八千名。
    从被迫参加李伪军的李学秀、金亨植两人的经历，就可以看出美方强迫扣留战俘的全部阴谋。李学秀和金亨植都是汉城人。他们在一九五零年八月间参加朝鲜人民军，同年十月间被俘，分别被拘禁在美方巨济岛战俘营第八十四号营场和第七十一号营场。他们的拘留号码是三九六八零和七一六九四。
    据李学秀说：去年二月间，美李特务大规模地用暴力“甄别”第八十四号营场的战俘。他们对战俘强迫进行“个别询问”。当战俘坚决要求遣返祖国时，美李特务就在交给战俘的表格上写上一个英文字“GO”（去）。这实际上是一个命令特务进行毒打的记号。当战俘走出门口的时候，事先布置好的李匪特务就一拥而上，用木棍皮鞭毒打战俘。许多战俘还遭到电刑。战俘被打伤后，战俘医院还拒绝收容他们。许多战俘因伤重死亡。到五月底，美方就把战俘迁移到朝鲜大陆上的马山战俘营中去，准备把他们移交给李匪帮。在马山战俘营，战俘被分散拘禁在许多小营场内，便于美方施行恐怖统治。美李匪军订立了许多违反日内瓦公约的规定，如“不准唱歌”、“不准三人以上在一起说话”之类，并且藉口战俘违反规定，任意把他们打死打伤。李匪特务警备队经常突然搜查战俘住处，任意逮捕战俘，施以酷刑。忠诚于祖国的战俘不断地被李匪特务谋杀。为了掩盖这些恐怖的事实，当时范佛里特曾下令禁止记者访问包括马山战俘营在内的朝鲜大陆上的战俘营。
    从去年十月六日起，马山战俘营的一万一千名战俘，就被分成七批“释放”。李学秀、金亨植都是在十月二十五日第六批被“释放”的。李学秀说：在“释放”之前，美李特务强迫战俘参加反动组织
    “灭共同志会”，并且强迫他们宣誓参加李伪军。在他们被押送到永登浦后，有一个美军少将对他们讲话，公开用判处徒刑威胁他们参加李伪军。然后，他们就被移交给汉城警察局，被迫进行登记和领取“第二国民兵登记证”。他们“回家”不久，警察局就强迫他们去检查体格。李匪特务警察接连不断地威胁他们当兵，并且告诉他们说，去年七月间美方同样以“释放”为名移交给李匪帮的二万七千名战俘，都已被征入李伪军。李学秀眼看除了当兵以外，无路可走，但为了避免当战斗兵，就到美军“劳务处”去登记。但是这个机关名为“征募杂役工人”，实际上是美军搜罗炮灰的特务机关。李学秀被“劳务处”送到李伪军陆军本部所属的特务机关“HID”受短期训练后，就被补充到了李伪军中去。
    金亨植也同样被“劳务处”押送到美国海军陆战第一师所属的特务机关“TLO”充当特务。但是他被强迫当兵的方式和李学秀不同。因为金亨植已经超过李承晚匪帮公开征兵的年龄，李匪特务就藉口他没有职业，威胁要逮捕他。而事实上，警察局早已不准各行业雇用和收留战俘。金亨植走头无路，只好同样落在“劳务处”的圈套里。李学秀、金亨植都说：在他们受训期间，美李特务经常恐吓他们，不准他们暴露战俘身份。
    这些事实又一次证明：美方所以坚持荒谬的“自愿遣返”原则来破坏停战谈判，其目的之一是他们决心要把战俘移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰，以实现其“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶阴谋。
