    The Central Ministry of Commerce convened a National Warehousing Work Conference to exchange warehousing work experience and formulate this year's warehouse work plan.
    The Central Ministry of Commerce convened the first National Warehousing Work Conference of the Central Ministry of Commerce from January 30th to February 6th, formulated the 1953 warehouse work plan, and exchanged advanced experience in warehousing work.
    Over the past three years, with the development of state-owned commerce, the increase in the variety of commodities, and the expansion of turnover, the tasks of state-owned commercial warehouses have become increasingly heavy. However, there are shortcomings in warehousing work such as uneven workload, insufficient utilization of equipment capacity, separation of business and storage, unclear inventory, discrepancies between accounts and goods, and damage to goods. The utilization rate of Tianjin Warehouse Company from January to August last year was only 59%; 114 out of 665 kinds of goods in Hebei Baoding Department Store did not match accounts and goods; in the Southwest region, seven companies' warehouses had overstocked goods with losses of more than 4 billion yuan. In order to improve warehouse work, rationally use warehouses, and ensure commodity circulation, the former Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government decided in August last year to pilot the economic accounting system in trade warehouses in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, to form some warehouses into warehouse companies, and to formulate several trial measures such as the quota management of warehouse area usage. After the trial implementation in the four cities, first of all, the warehouse area was clarified, and the capacity of the warehouse was improved; secondly, the procedures were simplified, the system was improved, and the work efficiency was improved. After the implementation of quotas in the freight yards of the state-owned trade system in Tianjin, the total area was 520,000 square meters more than before, increasing the area utilization rate by 36.5%; the average area utilization rate of warehouses of five companies including Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth increased by 24.35%. Calculated at 10,000 yuan per square meter of warehouse rent per month, Tianjin and Beijing can save the country more than 50 billion yuan a year.
    The meeting focused on exchanging advanced warehousing work experience from various places, and affirmed that the four main types of experience should be promoted throughout the country. First, the warehouse storage instruction diagram. It uses a wooden board or piece of paper to mark the location of the stored goods on the diagram, so that you can clearly understand the inventory and facilitate the circulation of goods. There are now three types of this diagram: one is Shenyang Pan Jikuan's "Cargo Location Plan View", which is suitable for simple warehouses with general goods; one is Tianjin Li Shizhong's "Warehouse Management Command Board", which is suitable for warehouses with rapid turnover of goods; one is Beijing Liu Yanzhen's "Goods Storage Instruction Diagram", which is suitable for warehouses with a wide variety of goods. Second, the three-member joint office system for warehouse accountants, storekeepers, and business personnel. In the past, these three types of personnel did not work together, and the work was very inconvenient. The adoption of this system can shorten the delivery time, increase work efficiency by 12 times, and save personnel by 27.8%. Third, use cement blocks instead of sleepers to pad the bottom of the cargo piles. Implementing this method can save the country a lot of timber. Fourth, Tianjin Trade Warehouse Company's Dong Jianyi created a simple warehouse measurement method. In order to implement the economic accounting system in warehouses, it is necessary to first clarify the warehouse area. This simple measurement method solves the difficulty that warehouse staff have low educational levels and cannot measure.
    At this meeting, everyone clearly realized that doing a good job in warehousing is an important key to the implementation of the economic accounting system in state-owned commerce. It is recognized that unclear inventory, countless goods, and the lack of close contact between warehouses and business will lead to the phenomenon of hot goods becoming cold goods, cold goods becoming substandard goods, and substandard goods becoming bad goods, which seriously affects the circulation of goods. Poor warehouse management and waste of warehouse capacity will increase commodity circulation costs. Failure to understand the actual situation of the warehouse will prevent the warehouse equipment capacity from being brought into play, wasting construction funds.
    The meeting was summarized by Wang Xingrang, Deputy Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Commerce. He emphasized that the warehouse work should implement the economic accounting system, and must implement three spirits: first, clarify responsibilities, implement zoned and classified storage, and assign special responsibilities for storage, in order to give play to the enthusiasm of all employees; second, promote commodity circulation, and achieve fast in and fast out of goods, clearly and clearly; third, give full play to equipment capacity and reduce costs.
    Finally, the meeting made a "Decision on Warehouse Reform Work" and formulated a plan for warehousing work in 1953: In the first half of the year, in the warehouse sector of the national commercial system, large and medium-sized cities will complete area measurement, complete the storage quotas for major commodities, and establish warehouse companies in fifteen cities to gain experience, and then gradually establish a batch of warehouse companies in the second half of the year.

    中央商业部召开全国仓储工作会议交流仓储工作经验制订今年仓库工作计划
    中央人民政府商业部于一月三十日至二月六日召开了中央商业部第一届全国仓储工作会议，制订了一九五三年仓库工作计划，交流了仓储工作的先进经验。
    三年来，随着国营商业的发展，商品种类的增多和流转额的扩大，国营商业仓库的任务一天天加重。但是在仓库工作中存在着忙闲不均、设备能力没有充分发挥、业务与保管脱节、库存不清、帐货不符、商品损坏等缺点。天津仓库公司去年一至八月份的使用率只到百分之五十九；河北保定百货公司六百六十五种商品中有一百一十四种帐货不符；西南区有七个公司的仓库积压商品损失达四十多亿元。为了改进仓库工作，合理使用仓库，保证商品流转，原中央人民政府贸易部曾于去年八月决定在北京、天津、上海、武汉四市的贸易仓库试行经济核算制，把部分仓库组成仓库公司，制定了仓库面积使用定额管理等几项试行办法。经过四市试行结果，首先是查清了仓库面积，提高了仓库的容纳量；其次是简化了手续，改进了制度，提高了工作效率。天津市国营贸易系统的货场实行定额后，总面积较前多出五十二万平方公尺，提高面积使用率百分之三十六点五；北京市花纱布等五个公司仓库的面积平均使用率提高百分之二十四点三五。以每月每平方公尺仓租一万元计算，天津、北京两市一年即可为国家节省五百多亿元。
    会议着重交流了各地先进仓储工作经验，并肯定了其中主要的四种经验要在全国各地推广。第一、仓库保管指示图。它是用一块木板或纸片把商品存放的地点标示在图上，看到这图就可以清楚了解库存，便利商品流转。这种图现在有三种：一种是沈阳潘吉宽的“货位平面图”，适合于一般商品简单的仓库；一种是天津李士忠“仓库管理指挥牌”，适合于商品进出次数很快的仓库；一种是北京刘彦贞“货物保管指示图”，适合于商品种类繁多的仓库。第二、仓库会计员、保管员、业务员三员联系办公制。过去这三种人员不在一起办公，工作很不方便，采用这制度可缩短提货时间，提高工作效率十二倍，节省人员百分之二十七点八。第三、用洋灰制成方块代替枕木垫货垛底，实行这一办法可给国家节省大量木材。第四、天津市贸易仓库公司董坚毅创造的仓库简便丈量法。仓库实行经济核算制，必须首先弄清仓库面积，这一简便丈量法解决了仓库工作人员文化水平低，不会测量的困难。
    在这次会议上，大家明确认识到作好仓储工作是国营商业实行经济核算制的重要关键。认识到库存不清，货物无数，仓库与业务不密切联系，就会造成热货变冷货、冷货变次货、次货变坏货的现象，严重地影响商品的流转。仓库管理不善，浪费仓库容量，就会加大商品流转费。弄不清仓库现在实际情况，就不能发挥仓库设备能力，浪费建设资金。
    会议由中央人民政府商业部副部长王兴让做总结。他着重指出仓库工作要实行经济核算制，必须贯彻三个精神，第一、明确责任，实行分区分类保管，保管专责，以发挥全体职工的积极性；第二、促进商品流转，做到商品快进快出，清清楚楚；第三、充分发挥设备能力，降低费用。
    最后，会议作出了“关于仓库改革工作的决定”，并制订了一九五三年仓储工作的计划：上半年在全国商业系统仓库方面，大中城市完成面积丈量，完成主要商品保管定额，并建立十五个城市的仓库公司以取得经验，下半年再逐步建立一批仓库公司。
