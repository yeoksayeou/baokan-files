    Motherland, I am Back
    Weiyang
    Editor's Note: This is a poem sent to the editorial department of this newspaper from Kaiyuan. The author did not write their real name, but in a postscript said: "I am a volunteer soldier, returning to the motherland, and I really have a lot to say." We believe this is a work with patriotism and internationalism.
    The train crosses the Yalu River, as if flying.
    Motherland, I am back,
    Motherland, my dear mother!
    I see you waving to your son who is far from your knee.
    The train crosses the Yalu River, as if flying,
    But it is still not fast enough!
    My train! Why are you so slow?
    You don't understand the hearts of your sons and daughters at all!
    The train crosses the Yalu River, the east and west of the river are different.
    It's not that the land on both sides is not equally fertile and beautiful;
    It's not that the people on both sides are not equally hardworking and kind.
    I mean: On the east bank – blood is bathing shrapnel,
    On the west bank – densely packed sorghum stalks, every household with granaries full of grain.
    I mean: The people on the east bank live in underground rooms as dark as night during the day;
    The streets on the west bank are as bright as day at night!
    Motherland, as soon as I mention the east bank of the river, my heart flies back to the Korean front!
    The train crosses the Yalu River, and the people on the train say to me:
    "Take a good look at the motherland, comrade!
    Take a look at these newly built factories."
    1953 is the first spring of our Five-Year Plan—
    Spring is the season for bamboo shoots to break the ground,
    The chimneys of our factories should be like bamboo shoots in spring!
    The old people all say: a child does not leave his mother.
    Motherland, at the front, I really miss you!
    But I remember a Soviet song:
    "If my mother asks me where I am going, and what I am going to do,
    I say, I will fight for the motherland, to defend you, dear mother! ..."
    In the trenches, I hum it, as if I have returned to your side;
    In battle, I hum it, and I am incomparably brave!
    The train crosses the Yalu River, as if flying.
    Motherland, I am back,
    Motherland, my dear mother!
    But when my joyful tears drip into your arms,
    My heart flies to the Korean front again!

                January 1953, Northeast

    祖国，我回来了
    未央
    编者按：这是本报编辑部收到的寄自开原的一首诗，作者没有写真姓名，但在稿末附言中说：“我是一个志愿军战士，回到祖国，真是有很多话要说。”我们认为这是一篇具有爱国主义和国际主义热情的作品。车过鸭绿江，好像飞一样。祖国，我回来了，祖国，我的亲娘！我看见你正在向你远离膝下的儿子招手。车过鸭绿江，好像飞一样，但还是不够快呀！我的车呀！你为什么这么慢？一点也不懂得儿女的心肠！车过鸭绿江，江东江西不一样。不是两岸的土地不一样肥沃秀丽；不是两岸的人民不一样勤劳善良。我是说：江东岸——鲜血浴着弹片，江西岸——密密层层秫秸堆，家家户户谷满仓。我是说：江东岸的人民白天住着黑夜一样的地下室；江西岸的市街夜晚像白天一样亮堂！祖国呀，一提起江东岸，我的心又回到了朝鲜前方！车过鸭绿江，同车的人对我讲：“好好儿看看祖国吧，同志！看一看这些新修的工厂。”一九五三年是我们五年计划的头一个春天——春天是竹笋拔尖的季节，我们工厂的烟囱要像春天的竹笋一样！老人们都说：孩儿不离娘。祖国呀，在前线，我真想念你！但我记住一支苏维埃的歌：“假如母亲问我去哪里，去做什么事情，我说，我要为祖国而战斗，保卫你呀，亲爱的母亲！……”在坑道里，我哼着它，就像回到了你的身旁；在作战中，我哼着它，就勇敢无双！车过鸭绿江，好像飞一样。祖国，我回来了，祖国，我的亲娘！但当我的欢喜的眼泪滴在你怀里的时候，我的心儿却又飞到了朝鲜前方！
