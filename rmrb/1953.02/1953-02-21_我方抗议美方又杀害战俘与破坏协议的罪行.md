Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 20th: On February 16th, the U.S. side again shot and killed one of our captured personnel in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp. On February 19th, General Nam Il, our chief representative to the Korean Armistice Talks, lodged a serious protest with the other side, pointing out that the other side must bear full responsibility for the war crime of torturing and killing prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 19th: According to the U.S. side's announcement: On February 16th, in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp, another captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers was killed by the U.S. side. The U.S. side, as usual, fabricated a story saying that the prisoner of war was "murdered" by other prisoners of war. However, many prisoners of war who were forced to join the Syngman Rhee puppet army and forced to serve as airborne spies have fallen into our hands. They unanimously testified that in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the U.S. side sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gang special agents disguised as prisoners of war into various camps. These special agents continuously and secretly murdered prisoners of war loyal to the motherland, and then hung the prisoners' bodies in toilets or other remote places, so that the U.S. side could falsely claim that the prisoners of war "committed suicide" or "prisoners of war murdered prisoners of war." Obviously, this prisoner of war on Jeju Island was also murdered by Chiang bandit agents. Regarding this new massacre, the U.S. side, as usual, falsely claimed that it was conducting "further investigations." In fact, this so-called "investigation" is nothing more than a shameless trick played by the U.S. side to cover up its crimes. The fact that the "investigations" announced by the U.S. side for previous massacres have never been followed up completely proves this point.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 20th: At around 17:20 on February 16th, a U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement on the Kaesong Armistice Talks venue area and intruded into the airspace above the venue area. Our delegation's chief liaison officer lodged a protest with the other side on February 18th. At the liaison officer meeting between the two sides on February 19th, the other side had to admit that the U.S. military aircraft had flown over the venue area on February 16th. On the other hand, it once again distorted the agreements and understandings between the two sides, claiming that this overflight did not violate the agreement, attempting to shirk responsibility.

Our chief liaison officer once again solemnly pointed out: Military aircraft flying over the venue area is explicitly prohibited by the agreements and understandings between the two sides. It is absolutely not permissible for the other side to use weather and technical conditions as excuses without any factual basis to overturn the agreements and understandings. Our chief liaison officer also quoted the other side's previous letters replying to our protests regarding military aircraft flying over the venue area, pointing out that the other side had also clearly admitted many times in the past that military aircraft flying over the venue area was a violation of the agreement, and had expressed regret for this, claiming that it would take effective measures to restrain its military personnel so that similar incidents would not occur again. However, recently, the other side has been trying to deny its responsibility for violating the agreement, which is obviously a deliberate attempt to completely destroy the maintenance of the venue area, but the other side will never be able to escape full responsibility for destroying the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 19th: U.S. armed personnel illegally invaded Panmunjom last week, shot and wounded Korean military police, and set fire to a civilian house in the venue area. Our side has already lodged strong protests and warnings regarding this matter, and our chief liaison officer Zhu Ran requested the U.S. side to provide an explanation on the 18th. These serious provocative actions are a new trick in the U.S. side's conspiracy, the purpose of which is to use various means to make it impossible to maintain order in the venue area and to tear up all agreements related to the armistice talks. The U.S. liaison officer stationed in Panmunjom has not yet provided any explanation for these serious provocative actions.

The U.S. liaison officer still has not dispatched U.S. sentries to the joint office of the Panmunjom Security Officers. Although the sign of the office is hanging outside the tent, only Korean military police are on duty inside. According to the agreement between the two sides' liaison officers, both sides should have sentries stationed at the joint office for twenty-four hours a day. The U.S. side's non-compliance with the agreement after the suspension of the armistice talks makes one highly suspect that the U.S. side has the sincerity to maintain order in the venue area. The only explanation for the U.S. side's unwillingness to dispatch sentries to the joint office for maintaining security is to facilitate the illegal intrusion of special agents into the venue area for activities at night.

Since last month, the U.S. liaison officer has openly denied the responsibility for the U.S. bombers and fighter jets' repeated violations of the agreement, thereby encouraging those aircraft to make hostile flights in the venue area to threaten the security of the venue area. U.S. aircraft often use the neutral nature of the venue area to scout and bomb nearby positions. On the afternoon of February 16th, U.S. aircraft circled near the venue area several times, then deliberately flew between the marker balloons, and then circled over the conference tent and continued to scout nearby positions.

Recently, the U.S. air force chiefs have also used Panmunjom as an advanced observation post. When U.S. aircraft flew into the venue area and bombed nearby positions, they spread out maps outside the conference tent and studied them.

Colonel Zhu Ran has warned the U.S. chief liaison officer Calk that:

"If your side is determined to completely destroy the order of the venue area and determined to completely destroy the armistice talks, your side should formally express that your side will bear full responsibility for all the resulting consequences; otherwise, your side must strictly abide by the agreement and immediately stop all provocative actions that violate the agreement."

### 我方抗议美方又杀害战俘与破坏协议的罪行

    我方抗议美方又杀害战俘与破坏协议的罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】二月十六日，美方在济州岛战俘营中又打死我方被俘人员一名。二月十九日，朝鲜停战谈判我方首席代表南日将军向对方提出严重抗议，指出对方必须担负虐杀战俘的战争罪行的完全责任。
    【新华社开城十九日电】据美方宣布：二月十六日在济州岛战俘营内，又有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美方杀害。美方照例捏造说这名战俘是被其他战俘“谋杀”的。但是许多被迫参加李承晚伪军和被迫充当空降特务的战俘，已经落在我方手里，他们一致证明：美方为了强迫扣留战俘，派遣大批蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务分子冒充战俘混进各个营场中去。这些特务接连不断地暗地谋杀忠诚于祖国的战俘，然后把战俘尸体悬在厕所或其他偏僻地方，以便美方谎称战俘“自杀”或“战俘谋杀战俘”。显然，济州岛上的这个战俘也是一样被蒋匪特务谋杀的。对这一新的屠杀事件，美方照例谎称正在作“进一步调查”。其实，这种所谓“调查”，不过是美方为了掩饰自己罪行而耍的无耻花样罢了。美方对历次屠杀事件所宣布的“调查”都一直没有下文，就完全证明了这一点。
    【新华社开城二十日电】二月十六日十七时二十分左右，美方军用飞机一架违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议侵入会场区上空，已由我方代表团首席联络官在二月十八日向对方提出了抗议。在二月十九日双方联络官会上，对方一面不得不承认二月十六日美方军用飞机飞越会场区的事实，另一方面，又一次歪曲双方协议与谅解，声称这种飞越并不违反协议，企图藉此推卸责任。
    我方首席联络官再次严正指出：军用飞机飞越会场区是双方的协议与谅解所明确禁止的，决不能容许对方毫无事实根据地以气候与技术条件为藉口来推翻协议与谅解。我方首席联络官并引用对方以往对于军用飞机飞越会场区答复我方抗议的函件，指出对方过去也曾多次明白承认军用飞机飞越会场区为违反协议的事件，并曾对此表示遗憾，声称将采取有效措施约束其军事人员，使类似事件不再发生。而最近对方一味抵赖违反协议的责任，显然是蓄意彻底破坏会场区的维持，但对方绝不能逃脱破坏协议的完全责任。
    【新华社开城十九日电】美方武装人员曾在上星期非法侵入板门店，开枪打伤朝鲜军事警察，并在会场区纵火焚烧民房一所，关于这件事我方已经提过有力的抗议和警告，我方首席联络官朱然在十八日要求美方提出交代。这些严重的挑衅行动是美方阴谋的新花样，其目的是要用各种手段使得会场区无法维持秩序，并且撕毁一切有关停战谈判的协议。驻在板门店的美方联络官对于这些严重的挑衅行动仍然没有作任何交代。
    美方联络官仍然没有派遣美方的哨兵到板门店安全军官联合办事处。办事处的牌子虽然挂在帐篷的外面，但是只有朝鲜的军事警察在里面值勤。根据双方联络官的协议，在每天的二十四小时里双方都应该派有哨兵到联合办事处去。美方在中断停战谈判以后的这种不遵守协议的行动，使人非常怀疑美方是否有在会场区维持秩序的诚意。美方不愿意派遣哨兵到维持治安的联合办事处去，唯一的解释就是为了便于特务们在夜间非法侵入会场区进行活动。
    自从上月以来，美方联络官公开抵赖对于美国轰炸机和战斗机屡次违犯协议的行动应负的责任，因而怂恿了那些飞机在会场区作敌意的飞行，来威胁会场区的安全。美国飞机经常利用会场区的中立性质来侦察和轰炸附近的阵地。二月十六日下午，美国飞机在会场区附近盘旋了好几次，以后故意在作为标志的气球间飞行，接着又到会议帐篷的上空盘旋，并往附近的阵地继续侦察。
    最近美国的空军头子们还利用板门店作为前进的观测站。当美国飞机飞入会场区并轰炸附近的阵地时，他们就在会议帐篷的外面摊开地图研究。
    朱然上校已经警告美方首席联络官卡洛克说：
    “假若你方决心完全破坏会场区的秩序并且决心完全破坏停战谈判，你方就应该正式表示，对于因此引起的一切后果，你方要负完全责任；不然的话，你方必须严格遵守协议，并且立刻停止违犯协议的
    一切挑衅行动。”
