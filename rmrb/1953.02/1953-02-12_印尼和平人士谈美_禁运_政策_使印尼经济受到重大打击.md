Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Jakarta: According to Jakarta newspapers, Sidik Djojosukarto, Chairman of the Indonesian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, said at a press conference announcing the end of the preparatory committee: "The US 'embargo' policy has inflicted blows on the economies of many countries, and Indonesia is no exception in this regard." He pointed out: "As a result of accepting 'aid' from the US Mutual Security Agency, large quantities of Indonesian gasoline were shipped to Korea to supply the war." He said: Imperialists, afflicted with war mania, are also plundering large quantities of various raw materials from Indonesia to manufacture weapons of murder.

Otto Rendu Nou, an Indonesian member of parliament who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in China, also expressed dissatisfaction with the 'embargo' policy manipulated by the United States through the United Nations. During his inspection of social conditions in Surabaya at the end of last December, he pointed out at a press conference: "The 'embargo' has had a negative impact on Indonesia's economy." Otto Rendu Nou said: "We could have traded with the new China. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people need rubber for agricultural construction and the manufacture of daily necessities. The 'embargo' has dealt a major blow to Indonesia's export trade."

    印尼和平人士谈美“禁运”政策
    使印尼经济受到重大打击
    【新华社十一日讯】据雅加达报纸消息：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议印尼筹备委员会主席西狄·格打巴地在宣布筹备委员会结束的记者招待会上说：“美国的‘禁运’政策使好些国家的经济受到了打击，在这方面，印尼也不是例外。”他指出：“接受美国共同安全署的‘援助’的结果是：大量的印尼汽油被运往朝鲜供应战争。”他说：患了战争狂的帝国主义者还从印尼大量搜刮各种原料，用来制造杀人武器。
    曾到中国参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印尼国会议员奥托·伦度诺乌对美国操纵联合国通过的‘禁运’政策同样表示不满。他在去年十二月底到泗水视察社会情况时在记者招待会上指出：“禁运”使印尼的经济受到了恶劣影响。奥托·伦度诺乌说：“我们本是可以和新中国通商的，数亿中国人民在农业建设和日用品的制造上都需要橡胶。‘禁运’使印尼的出口贸易受到了重大的打击。”
