    Materials Exchange Fairs Held in Various Locations
    to Supply Holiday Goods and Production Materials
    Prior to the Spring Festival, various localities held small-scale materials exchange fairs to meet the demands of the broad masses of farmers for holiday goods and production materials. The transaction volume of these materials exchange fairs was significantly larger than that of the materials exchange fairs held during the summer and autumn. In some cases, it even increased by more than double.
    At the materials exchange fairs in various localities, the quantity of holiday goods purchased by farmers has greatly increased. This reflects the trend of the people's living standards steadily improving. The materials exchange fairs held in Hubei Province in January sold off certain previously stockpiled goods, such as local products like soybean oil, sesame oil, tallow, and raw sugar produced in the province. At the materials exchange fairs held in various localities before the Spring Festival, farmers not only requested a larger supply of goods but also demanded the supply of better goods. For example, farmers in the Mayu District of Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, used to buy Qingyuan twill fabric for clothing, but now they are buying Qingyuan serge fabric of better quality. The sales of Qingyuan twill fabric have become sluggish. A type of Sixi hat, selling for 6,000 yuan per hat, used to be a bestseller before the Spring Festival, but this year no one is interested. However, Russian-style hats, priced at over 19,000 yuan each and known for their good quality and attractive appearance, sold very well. At the materials exchange fair in Wencheng County, Zhejiang Province, many private merchants did not anticipate the farmers' demand for high-quality goods and transported a large batch of Pingyang homespun cloth, which no one cared about; however, cotton cloth and rubber shoes of higher quality were sold out.
    In order to expand agricultural production this year, farmers have been actively purchasing large quantities of fertilizers, soybean cakes, and other production materials at materials exchange fairs in various locations. In the ten counties of Changzhi Special District, Shanxi, the production materials sold accounted for 33% of the total sales of industrial products. At the materials exchange fair in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, 95% of the purchasing plans of the farmer representatives were for oxen and agricultural implements.
    The materials exchange fairs held in various localities before the Spring Festival were organized on the basis of implementing commercial adjustments, and private merchants participated very enthusiastically in the transactions. At the materials exchange fair in Beixinjing Town, a suburb of Shanghai, the total retail transaction volume was over 660 million yuan, with private commercial businesses accounting for 75% of the turnover; among them, the turnover of private cured and fresh goods, northern and southern goods, and general merchandise industries increased three to ten times compared to normal, and the turnover of some seasonal industries such as woodenware and bamboo ware also increased significantly. In the materials exchange fairs in 23 counties of Zhejiang Province, the transaction volume of private merchants accounted for more than 55% of the total transaction volume. During the exchange fairs, People's Bank loans accounted for only 5% of the total transaction volume, indicating that private commercial businesses are able to fully utilize their own funds to develop their businesses. At the materials exchange fair in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, the retail sales of private merchants increased 2.2 times compared to the autumn exchange fair and 3.6 times compared to the summer exchange fair.
        Various cultural and recreational promotional activities were also organized at the materials exchange fairs in various localities. Using forms such as blackboards, local broadcasts, street lectures, picture exhibitions, slideshows, movies, and plays, farmers were widely educated about the Marriage Law, the agricultural bumper harvest movement, the current specific tasks in rural areas, and the three major tasks of our country this year.

    各地纷纷举行物资交流会
    供应节货和生产资料
    在春节以前，各地为了满足广大农民购买节货和生产资料的要求，普遍地举行了小型物资交流会。这些物资交流会的交易额，比夏秋间举行的物资交流会上的交易额大为增加。有的竟增加一倍以上。
    在各地物资交流会上，农民购买节货的数量大大增加了。这反映了人民生活日益提高的趋势。湖北省在一月间举行的物资交流会，把过去积压的某些商品，如该省出产的豆油、麻油、皮油、土糖等土产，都销售出去了。各地在春节前举行的物资交流会上，农民不但要求供给更多的商品，而且要求供应更好的商品。如浙江瑞安县马屿区的农民，过去都是买青元斜纹布做衣服，现在都买质量较好的青元哔叽布做衣服。青元斜纹布的销路已经不畅了。当地有一种四喜帽，卖六千元一顶，过去春节前畅销，今年却无人过问。售价一万九千多元的质量好又美观的罗宋帽，却卖了很多。浙江省文成县的物资交流会上，许多私商没有估计到农民要求质量高的商品的趋势，运去大批平阳土布，都无人过问；但品质较高的棉布、胶鞋等却销售一空。
    农民为了扩大今年的农业生产，纷纷在各地物资交流会上购买大量肥料、豆饼及其他生产资料。山西长治专区十个县物资交流会上，销售的生产资料，占全部工业品销量的百分之三十三。广东省台山县物资交流会上，农民代表在购买计划中，有百分之九十五为耕牛、农具。
    各地春节前的物资交流会是在贯彻调整商业的基础上举行的，私商参加交易者十分踊跃。上海市郊区北新泾镇的物资交流会上，零售成交额共六亿六千余万元，私营商业营业额占百分之七十五；其中私营腌鲜、南北货、百货等业的营业额比平时增加三倍到十倍，部分季节性行业如木器、竹器也较平时营业额增加很多。浙江省二十三个县的物资交流会中，私商成交额占整个交易额的百分之五十五以上。在交流会中，人民银行贷款仅占成交总额的百分之五，这说明私营商业能够充分地运用本身资金发展业务。江苏松江县物资交流会上，私商零售额比秋季交流会增加二点二倍，比夏季交流会增加三点六倍。
        各地物资交流会也组织了各种文娱宣传活动。以黑板报、土广播、街头讲演、画片展览、幻灯、电影、演戏等形式，广泛地向农民宣传婚姻法、农业丰产运动、当前农村各项具体工作和今年我们国家的三大任务。
