    Don't Mess Up the Steps of Rectifying Primary Education

    According to an investigation by reporters from the Guangzhou Southern Daily, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Finance Department, at its Fourth Financial Conference held in December last year, citing the need to control expenses, instructed the representatives attending the meeting to persuade primary school students over the age of fifteen to drop out of school upon returning to their respective localities. Based on this requirement from the Finance Department, the three regions of central Guangdong, western Guangdong, and Hainan have recently begun this work. This measure by the Finance Department was decided independently, without even consulting the Education Department. On the same grounds, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Finance Department recently also decided to suspend the salaries of some primary school teachers starting from February.

    These actions by the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Finance Department have disrupted the steps of rectifying primary education and violate the Central Committee's spirit regarding the rectification of primary education; furthermore, unilaterally determining such actions without the Central Committee's approval is an act of organization indiscipline. As far as we know, similar practices to those of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Finance Department have occurred in Northeast China, Hebei, Hunan, and other places, or still exist today. We believe that any region with such erroneous practices should immediately find ways to correct them.

    Every task we undertake should be led by a competent authority, and we must not interfere arbitrarily. For example, the task of rectifying primary education should naturally be led by the education department, with the finance department playing a supporting role, assisting in the process, rather than substituting for the education department. Some comrades working in finance have not understood this point. They neither know the nature of this work nor the Central Committee's policies and the steps for carrying out this work in this regard, and they have interfered based solely on the perspective of their local work, thereby completely turning a task with significant positive implications into a negative thing. This inevitably creates a vague understanding among the masses and increases difficulties for future work.

    To meet the requirements of the large-scale national construction undertaking, all departments have formulated plans for 1953, and these plans must be earnestly implemented. However, when implementing these plans, we should distinguish between what is to be prepared and what is to be done immediately, and we must not immediately start work that requires thorough preparation. For example, rectifying primary education is a task we are preparing to undertake, but how exactly should it be done? The relevant departments of the Central Committee are actively planning and have not yet formally issued instructions, nor have they allowed localities to start immediately. Therefore, for tasks like this, localities should not act arbitrarily and make their own decisions. Some places have actually taken it upon themselves to act arbitrarily, which is clearly wrong.

    It should be recognized that rectifying primary education is a task with a very wide scope, and it must be carried out with proper methods, careful steps, and caution, and we must not be hasty. Before the Central Committee formally issues instructions, all localities should immediately stop free actions to avoid spoiling the work and causing unnecessary losses.

### 不要把整顿小学教育的步骤搞乱

    不要把整顿小学教育的步骤搞乱
    据广州南方日报记者调查，广东省人民政府财政厅在去年十二月举行的第四次财政会议上，曾以控制经费为理由，通知参加会议的代表在回到各地以后，要说服十五岁以上的小学学生退学。根据财政厅的这种要求，最近粤中、粤西、海南三个地区已开始进行这一工作。而财政厅的这种措施，是自行决定的，甚至没有和文教厅商量。根据同样理由，广东省人民政府财政厅最近又决定，从二月份起，停发一部分小学教师的薪金。
    广东省人民政府财政厅的这些做法，搞乱了整顿小学教育的步骤，是违背中央关于整顿小学教育的精神的；而未经中央批准就擅自确定这样的做法，则是一种无组织无纪律的行为。据我们了解，类似广东省人民政府财政厅的这种做法，在东北、河北、湖南等地都曾经发生过，或者至今还存在着。我们认为，不论任何地区，凡是有这种错误作法的，都应该立即设法纠正。
    我们的每一项工作，都应该有一个主管部门来主持进行，决不能乱插手。如像整顿小学教育这项工作，当然应该由教育部门来主持，财政部门应该居于配合的地位，协助进行，而不应该代替教育部门去做。有些做财政工作的同志，没有弄清这一点，他们既不知道这一工作的性质，又不知道中央在这方面的政策以及进行这一工作的步骤，只从局部工作着眼，就插了一手，以致把一件具有重大积极意义的工作，完全弄成了消极的东西。这就不可免地在群众中造成一种模糊的认识，给今后的工作增加困难。
    适应大规模国家建设事业的要求，各部门都拟定了一九五三年计划，这些计划必须认真执行。但是在执行计划的时候，应该区别那些是准备要做的，那些是马上要做的，决不能把尚须做充分准备的工作马上就做起来。例如，整顿小学教育是我们准备要做的工作，但是究竟应该怎样做？中央有关部门正在积极筹划，还没有正式发布指示，更没有让各地立即动手来做。因此，像这样的工作，各地就不应该自作主张，任意行动。有些地方竟然自作主张任意行动起来，这显然是错误的。
    应该认识，整顿小学教育是牵涉范围很广的一项工作，必须有妥善的办法，周密的步骤，慎重进行，决不能草率从事。在中央没有正式发布指示以前，各地应立即制止自由行动，以免把工作弄坏，招致不必要的损失。
