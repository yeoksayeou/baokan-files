    CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee Investigates Xin Yuanxi, et al., for Suppressing Criticism

    The General Office of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee writes: The "Readers' Letters Summary" titled "Resolutely Fight Against the Behavior of Suppressing Criticism" was published in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters Page" on January 29th. Regarding the matter of Xin Yuanxi, the former president of the Su Nan People's Bank, and others suppressing criticism, the Provincial Committee had already instructed the Discipline Inspection Committee to cooperate with the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, and other relevant departments to investigate and handle it before the newspaper published it. Regarding the issue of Jiang Chunkuo, the manager of the Suzhou Transportation Company, suppressing criticism, we have notified the Suzhou Municipal Committee to handle it. After the above two cases are processed, we will inform you of the results.
