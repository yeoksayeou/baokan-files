The Party of Lenin and Stalin, which inspires and organizes our people to engage in the struggle for the victory of communism, is never satisfied with the achievements already obtained and strives to achieve new and greater achievements on the road to the great goal. The uncompromising nature of the fight against shortcomings stems from the nature of our party and its revolutionary spirit.

Lenin said: Ruthless exposure of one's own shortcomings is necessary for "all vigorous and vital parties," and "there is nothing more vulgar than complacent optimism."

Our Party warns cadres not to fall into complacency, to treat shortcomings uncompromisingly, and to insist on eliminating them.

Comrade Stalin taught: "Let the Party, let the Bolsheviks, let all honest workers and working people of our country expose the shortcomings in our work, the shortcomings in our construction, let them point out ways to eliminate our shortcomings..."

The 19th National Congress of the Party put forward new and great tasks for communist construction. To accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to further improve the work of all our organizations and organs. The more uncompromising the Party organization's attitude towards shortcomings and the more effective the criticism of shortcomings, the faster we will move forward. The Congress pointed out that it is necessary to end the complacency and euphoria over achievements that harm our cause, to end the phenomena of boasting and self-satisfaction in the Party ranks; it is necessary to bravely and resolutely expose and eliminate the shortcomings and weaknesses in our work, implement intra-Party democracy, and more widely unfold self-criticism and criticism from below.

As everyone knows, in the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, and in the work of various departments of our construction, there are errors and shortcomings, and there are still many bad and sometimes morbid phenomena. For example, up to now, the overall good indicators of our entire industry still conceal the poor work of many enterprises that have not fulfilled the tasks assigned by the state. In some places, Party organizations have still not overcome the phenomenon of underestimating ideological work, which has been shown at some recent plenary sessions of Party committees.

The main method of fighting against shortcomings is self-criticism and criticism from below. However, some of our staff, including those on the ideological front, would rather turn a deaf ear than sincerely admit their mistakes and shortcomings, or else cover them up. We still have many staff who are good at seeing the shortcomings of others and thus criticizing them (which is naturally correct), but avoid self-criticism and are unwilling to critically evaluate their own work. Those who have made mistakes but do not have the courage to admit them, are afraid to face the truth, and dodge and play tricks, are cowards.

A truly Party-minded and communist-worthy uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings means not only admitting shortcomings, but also correcting them. The attitude towards criticism is not examined by verbal guarantees, but by the actual correction of the mistakes made and the determination to improve work. Comrade Stalin taught that the duty of a Communist Party member is not to conceal his mistakes, not to equivocate on the issue of his own mistakes as often happens here, but to sincerely and openly admit his mistakes, sincerely and openly point out ways to correct these mistakes, and sincerely and openly correct his mistakes.

Practical life proves that in the rotten atmosphere of mutual boasting and covering up mistakes, none of our work departments can develop smoothly. Uncompromising treatment of shortcomings means being strict with oneself and with others, not allowing abscesses to fester internally, but resolutely exposing them, broadly carrying out self-criticism and criticism, breaking through sentimentality, and not caring about one's own self-esteem or that of others, but only taking the interests of the cause as a guide.

If shortcomings are not allowed to develop, if they are stopped when they are budding, then it is easier to eliminate them. But some staff lack this quality. Not long ago, "Pravda" received a letter from Comrade Zhimakina, a female worker and Communist Party member of the Poltava Meat Products Joint Manufacturing Factory. She reported that the female workers of the joint factory had repeatedly warned the Poltava Oblast Party Committee about the serious shortcomings in the work of this enterprise, but the Oblast Committee had not taken the necessary measures. As a result, the shortcomings in the factory developed more and more. Finally, things evolved to the point where the secretary of the factory Party organization not only completely obeyed those who violated Party and state discipline, but also began to engage in corruption himself.

Leaders who do not listen to criticism from below, treat shortcomings in their work with leniency, and allow shortcomings to have the opportunity to develop, are not competent for the demands placed on them. The brilliance of leadership lies in its ability to see dangers in the bud and not allow them to develop into a threat. At the same time, it is important not to give up halfway in the struggle against bad phenomena in work, to carry out what has been started to the end, to expose the causes of shortcomings, and to point out concrete ways to correct these shortcomings.

In our practical work, we can still encounter many such facts, that is, leaders are satisfied with the achievements they have reached, and think that it is superfluous to bother themselves with tasks such as exposing and eliminating shortcomings, although doing so would help achieve greater results. The Kemerovo Coke Chemical Factory is one of the advanced factories in the "Coke General Administration" system of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy. This anesthetic acted on the leaders of this bureau. They apparently believed that since the factory's work was not going badly, there was no need to bother themselves with exposing the shortcomings in the factory's work. But in fact, there were many untapped reserves in this factory, and if they were used, production would be further improved. The factory management and the Party organization had written to the General Administration more than once about the urgent needs of the factory, but things had not progressed.

A persistent struggle against the shortcomings and problems in the work of the Party, Soviet, economic, and other organizations should be our daily work. A Communist Party member cannot treat unhealthy phenomena and shortcomings in his work with indifference, let alone conceal these things from the Party. The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulates that Party members have the obligation: "To report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs up to the Central Committee of the Party, regardless of who the report involves. Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations and not to ask about incorrect actions that harm the interests of the Party and the state. Anyone who hinders a Party member from fulfilling this obligation shall be severely punished as a violator of the Party's will."

It must be pointed out that this requirement of the Party Constitution is far from being followed everywhere.

In his report to the 19th National Congress of the Party, Comrade Malenkov said that the responsibility of every leader, especially Party workers, is to create conditions so that all honest Soviet people can boldly and fearlessly criticize the shortcomings in the work of our organizations and organs. Correctly organizing the inspection of the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government has great significance in the struggle against shortcomings and in preventing these shortcomings. The purpose of checking implementation is, first of all, to expose shortcomings, to expose illegal acts, to help loyal staff, to offer them opinions, and to punish those who refuse to correct shortcomings, in order to ensure the implementation of the decisions that have been adopted.

Party organizations should educate Communist Party members and all Soviet people to have an uncompromising spirit towards shortcomings, towards everything backward, old-fashioned, and hindering our victorious advance; it should temper cadres in lively daily work, in the flames of practical experience; and arm them with the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

Our local Party organizations, in consolidating and expanding ties with the masses, bravely unfolding self-criticism and criticism from below, resolutely exposing and eliminating shortcomings in work, will further enhance their role in all economic and cultural sectors, and enhance their role in mobilizing the working people to successfully realize the historic resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Party.

### 勇敢而坚决地揭发和消灭缺点  苏联“真理报”一月十一日社论

    勇敢而坚决地揭发和消灭缺点
    苏联“真理报”一月十一日社论
    鼓舞和组织我国人民从事争取共产主义胜利的斗争的列宁——斯大林的党，从不满足于已获得的成就，力求在走向伟大目标的道路上获得日新月异的成就。对缺点的战斗的不调和性是来源于我们党的本性和它的革命的精神的。
    列宁说：无情地揭露自己的缺陷，对于“所有富于生气的和有生活力的政党说来”，都是必要的，“再没有比自满的乐观主义更庸俗的了。”
    我们的党警告干部，不要他们陷于自满，要他们不调和地对待缺点，并坚持消灭它们。
    斯大林同志教导说：“让党、让布尔什维克、让我国一切诚实的工人和劳动分子来揭露我们工作中的缺点、我们建设中的缺点吧，让他们指出消灭我们缺点的途径………”。
    党的第十九次代表大会曾提出了共产主义建设的新的巨大任务。为完成这些任务就需要更进一步地改善所有我们的组织和机关的工作。党组织对待缺点的态度越具有不调和性，对缺点的批评越是有效，那么我们也就会前进得越快。代表大会曾指出：必须终止那种危害我们事业的自满和因成绩而狂喜的心情，终止党的队伍中的炫耀和沾沾自喜的现象；必须勇敢而坚决地揭发和消灭我们工作中的缺点和弱点，贯彻实行党内民主，更广泛地展开自我批评和自下而上的批评。
    大家知道，在党、苏维埃和经济组织的工作中，在我们建设的各个不同部门的工作中，存在着错误和缺点，仍有不少恶劣的、而且有时是病态的现象。例如到目前为止，我们整个工业的良好工作的总指标还掩盖着不少企业的低劣工作，这些企业没有完成国家指定的任务。一些地方的党组织仍没有克服低估思想工作的现象，这在最近举行的一些党委员会全体会议上已显示了出来。
    与缺点斗争的主要方法是自我批评和自下而上的批评。但是我们某些工作人员，其中也包括思想战线上的工作人员，却宁愿装聋作哑，而不肯真诚地承认自己的错误和缺点，要不然就是掩饰这些错误和缺点。我们仍有不少的工作人员，他们虽善于看出旁人的缺点并因此来批评他们（这自然是正确的），但却逃避自我批评，不愿批判地来评价自己的工作。那些犯了错误而又没有勇气承认、害怕正视真理、躲闪、玩诡计的人，都是懦夫。
    对待缺点的真正有党性的、配称为共产党员的不调和性，不仅是指承认缺点，而且还要纠正缺点。对批评的态度不是用口头保证、而是用实际上纠正所犯过失和努力改进工作的决心来审查的。斯大林同志教导说，共产党员的责任就是不掩饰自己的错误，就是不像在我们这里所常发生的那样，在有关自己错误的问题上支吾搪塞，而是要真诚和公开地承认自己的错误，真诚和公开地指出改正这些错误的途径，并真诚和公开地纠正自己的错误。
    实际生活证明，在互相吹嘘、包庇错误的腐烂的气氛中，我们任何一个工作部门都无法顺利发展。不调和地对待缺点就是指：对自己和对旁人都要求严格，不让脓疮向内部溃烂，而是坚决地揭发它们，广泛地开展自我批评和批评，破除情面，既不顾惜自己的自尊心，也不顾惜旁人的自尊心，而只是以事业的利益为指针。
    如果不让缺点发展，如果在它萌芽时便加以制止，那么消灭缺点就比较容易。但某些工作人员却缺乏这种品质。不久以前，“真理报”接到了坡尔塔瓦肉品联合制造工厂女工、共产党员日玛基娜同志的一封信。她报告说，联合工厂的女工们曾多次向坡尔塔瓦州党的州委会预告关于这个企业工作中所存在的严重缺点，但州委会却没有采取必要的措施。因此厂里的缺点便发展得愈来愈大。最后，事情演变到，工厂党组织的书记不仅完全顺从了那些破坏党和国家的纪律的人们，而且他自己也开始营私舞弊起来。
    不倾听自下而上的批评，以宽容的态度对待工作中的缺点，并让缺点有机会发展的领导者们，是不能够胜任对他们所提出的要求的。领导的英明就在于它能够看出萌芽中的危险，并不使它发展成为一种威胁。同时，重要的是在和工作中的恶劣现象作斗争时，不可半途而废，要把开始了的事情进行到底，要揭发产生缺点的原因，并指出改正这些缺点的具体途径。
    在我们的实际工作中还可以遇到不少这样的事实，即领导者满足于已达到的成绩，认为拿揭发和消灭缺点这类工作来麻烦自己是多余的，虽然这样做是会帮助取得更大的成绩。克蔑洛沃焦炭化学工厂是黑色冶金工业部“焦炭总管理局”系统中的先进工厂之一。这副麻醉剂在这个局的领导者们身上起了作用。他们显而易见地认为，既然工厂的工作进行得还不坏，那就没有必要拿揭发企业工作中的缺点的事，来麻烦自己。但实际上，在这个工厂里却存有很多未利用的后备力量，如果动用它们便会使生产获得进一步的提高。工厂管理处和党组织曾不止一次地给总管理局写信说到工厂的迫切需要，但事情却一直没有进展。
    对党、苏维埃、经济组织和其他组织工作中的缺点和毛病进行坚持的斗争，应当是我们的日常工作。一个共产党员不可以漠不关心的态度来对待工作中的不健康现象和缺点，更不能向党隐瞒这些东西。苏联共产党党章规定党员有义务：“向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党和国家利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩。”
    必须指出，党章的这一要求，还远不是到处都被遵行。
    马林科夫同志在党的第十九次代表大会的报告中说，每个领导者，特别是党的工作者的责任，是要为使一切正直的苏联人都能大胆无畏地批评我们的组织与机关工作中的缺点而创造条件。正确地组织对执行党和政府决定的情况的检查，在和缺点作斗争和在防止这些缺点方面，有着重大的意义。检查执行的目的，首先就是要揭发缺点，揭露非法行为，帮助忠诚的工作人员，向他提出意见，惩罚不肯改正缺点的分子，以便保证执行已通过的决定。
    党组织应当教育共产党员和一切苏联人，使他们对缺点、对一切落后的、守旧的、阻碍我们胜利前进的事物，具有不调和的精神，它应当在生动的日常工作中，在实际经验的火焰中锻炼干部；并用马克思列宁主义的理论武装他们。
    我们的地方党组织在进行巩固和扩大与群众的联系、勇敢地展开自我批评和自下而上的批评、坚决地揭发和消灭工作的缺点中，将更加提高自己在一切经济和文化部门中的作用，提高自己在动员劳动人民顺利实现党的第十九次代表大会的历史性决议中的作用。　（张振亚译）
