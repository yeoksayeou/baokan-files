    Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station Decides to Rectify Existing Radio Listening Station Organizations
    Sichuan Province (excluding Beichuan, Changshou, Pengshui, Hechuan, and other cities and counties) has established 195 radio listening stations, with nearly 200,000 organized listeners. Radio listening stations in various places have used various forms to conduct propaganda and education among the masses. Radio listening stations in seventy-one counties have published radio newsletters, with a circulation of more than 19,000 copies per issue; radio listening stations in ninety counties and districts regularly provide propaganda materials to blackboard newspapers and local broadcasting stations (such as hilltop or rooftop broadcasting horns).
    In order to further improve the work of the radio network, the Sichuan Provincial People's Broadcasting Station convened the first provincial radio work conference in January of this year. The conference focused on studying and discussing various issues related to radio work, and decided to vigorously rectify the organization of existing radio listening stations so that the radio listening stations can better exert their propaganda and mobilization effectiveness and serve the country's large-scale economic construction.
