    Correct the Evil Work Style in the Operations of the Coal Construction Company

    Several news reports published in this newspaper today exposing the China Coal Construction Company's practice of selling inferior wood as high-quality wood reveal a series of serious problems existing within the China Coal Construction Company system. In order to pursue illegal profits, the Northeast Coal Construction Company blindly increased the output rate, reduced the specifications and quality of wood, and transported inferior wood into customs, passing it off as high-quality wood. The Coal Construction Companies in various parts of North China not only failed to conduct strict acceptance inspections of the large quantities of rotten wood transported from the Northeast and failed to raise objections responsibly; instead, they upgraded the wood's grade, selling inferior materials as high-quality materials. When the China Coal Construction Company and the Northeast Coal Construction Company signed the contract for wood entering customs, they neither conducted thorough investigations and research, nor made careful plans, let alone inspected the implementation of the contract. Subordinate companies continuously reported that the wood entering customs was causing significant losses to the state, but the head office first issued a document notifying the Northeast to pay attention; later, it adopted methods such as "saved for future reference," "handled concurrently," and "archived," shirking all responsibility; and finally even instructed subordinate companies to "vigorously operate substandard materials" and "vigorously promote substandard materials," blatantly undermining the interests of the state and the people.

    These people lack the most basic sense of national consciousness and a spirit of being conscientious and responsible for their work. They completely failed to consider, or turned a blind eye to, the serious consequences caused by such reckless actions: affecting the credibility of state-owned enterprises, damaging the lifespan of basic construction projects, and causing worker injuries and fatalities. This is absolutely not allowed.

    The problems existing within the China Coal Construction Company system are certainly not limited to these. However, solving the problems should start from these main aspects. We hope that all employees of the China Coal Construction Company will start with these facts, continue to expose the company's erroneous thinking and behavior in business operations, launch a struggle against bureaucracy, and transform the "unreasonable company" into a coal construction company that serves the people and meets the needs of the country's large-scale construction.

    纠正煤建公司经营中的恶劣作风
    本报今天发表的几篇揭露中国煤建公司以坏木材冒充好木材出售的消息，暴露了煤建公司系统中存在着的一连串的严重问题。东北煤建公司为了追逐非法利润，盲目提高出材率，降低木材的规格质量，把坏木材冒充好木材运进关内。华北各地煤建公司对于东北运来的大批腐朽木材，不仅不严格验收，负责提出意见；反而提高木材等级，以坏材充好材出卖。中国煤建公司和东北煤建公司订立木材进关合同的时候，既没有进行充分的调查研究，又没有作周密的计划，更没有检查合同执行情况。下级公司不断反映进关木材给国家造成了重大损失，总公司先以一纸公文通知东北注意；以后就采取“存查”“并案办理”“归档”等办法，一推了事；最后甚至指示下级公司“大力经营等外材”“大力推销等外材”，明目张胆地破坏国家和人民的利益。
    这些人缺乏起码的国家观念和对自己的工作认真负责的精神，他们对于这样胡作非为引起的严重后果：影响国营企业的信誉，损害基本建设工程的寿命，造成工人的伤亡事故，等等，竟完全没有想到，或是视若无睹，这是绝对不能允许的。
    中国煤建公司系统中存在的问题当然不只这一些。但解决问题应从这些主要的方面开始。我们希望中国煤建公司的全体职工，从这些事实入手，继续揭发公司在业务经营中的错误思想和行为，开展反官僚主义的斗争，把“不合理公司”改造成为人民服务的、适合于国家大规模建设需要的煤建公司。
