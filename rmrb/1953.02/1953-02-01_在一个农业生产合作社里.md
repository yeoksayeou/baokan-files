In an Agricultural Production Cooperative

(Continued)

On the walls in many places in the village, various regulations formulated by the cooperative members' congress are written: 1. Obey the democratic leadership within the cooperative; 2. Cherish public property; 3. Be selfless and not lazy; 4. Cooperative first, family second (i.e., do the cooperative's work first, then the work on private plots); 5. Do not gossip behind people's backs, raise opinions at the meeting; 6. Must ask for leave when needed… Cooperative Chairman Li Furong said: "The process of implementing these regulations is a process of constantly educating cooperative members to overcome individualistic thinking and establish collectivistic thinking. The best way to ensure the implementation of these regulations is for everyone to formulate patriotic pledges based on their own weaknesses."

Indeed, that is the case.

In Wang Jingui's home, I saw a patriotic pledge posted on the wall, which read: "Get up on time every morning without being told, ensuring not to miss a single workday." His wife, Li Guaiguai, told me about the process of him making the patriotic pledge. She said, "He used to be lazy when working, not getting up until the sun was high. During the patriotic review day, everyone criticized him, so he made a pledge to correct it." I said, "How is it now?" Wang Jingui said, "Since being criticized on the patriotic review day, I first made a self-criticism saying: 'Before joining the cooperative, I was very diligent in my work. Why am I not so diligent now that I've joined the cooperative? The problem is simple: before, I was working for myself; now, I'm working for everyone.' Everyone said that this kind of selfish thinking is unacceptable. I thought about it, and everyone's words made sense. If everyone were like me, how could the cooperative continue to operate? From now on, I will do my work completely according to what is stated in the pledge." As Wang Jingui was speaking, Li Haiqing and Li Haizhen came to visit. Wang Jingui excitedly told me, "After they made their patriotic pledges, they have also improved." It turned out that Li Haizhen used to like to gossip about others behind their backs, and Li Haiqing liked to listen to him gossip. This often caused disunity among the cooperative members. They were criticized by everyone on the patriotic review day and firmly expressed their determination to correct their mistakes. Li Haizhen said to Li Haiqing, "Let's make a patriotic pledge to ensure it." Li Haiqing said, "We should have done that long ago." Li Haizhen's patriotic pledge was: "Guarantee not to say small talk." Li Haiqing's patriotic pledge was: "Guarantee not to listen to small talk."

In the achievement room, I saw that the evaluation summary praised those who had excellent achievements in implementing their patriotic pledges. Li Tuhai was one of them. He was a feeder, feeding ten cows. Each cow was fed better than the cows he used to feed, none of them got sick, and they all grew very fat. He was very particular about the methods of feeding the cows. He understood the appetite of each cow, promptly fed them the appropriate amount of grass, cleaned diligently, and added plenty of bedding. The cow sheds were always very clean, and the cows lived very comfortably. At the evaluation summary meeting, he talked about why he wanted to feed the cows well. He said, "Since becoming a feeder, I have felt a great responsibility. In the past, if I didn't feed my own cows well, it would at most delay my own production. Now, if I don't feed the cooperative's cows well, it will delay the production of all twenty households in the cooperative. Besides, we are now 'taking the cooperative as our home.' If we delay the cooperative's production, wouldn't we also be delaying our own production? So I must be responsible for feeding the cows well." Another person who was praised was Li Shurong. He was the farm tool keeper. He demanded that himself and others take care of public property seriously. He made the following regulations with everyone: 1. If any farm tool is damaged during use, it must be reported to the keeper for repair; 2. Each farm tool must be wiped clean after use; 3. The keeper must regularly check the number of farm tools, whether there is any damage, and whether they are wiped clean. Under his care, there were few cases of damage and loss of farm tools.

                 × × ×

I came out of the achievement room, and Cooperative Chairman Li Furong said:

"What do you think of our cooperative's achievement room?"

I paid special attention to this question: when the cooperative was first established, people called it the "Land Cooperative." Now, many people call it "Our Cooperative." Of course, this has great significance. In order to understand the situation in detail, I asked Li Furong:

"Why does everyone call it 'Our Cooperative' now?"

"Because the cooperative members have realized the superiority of the cooperative, everyone affectionately calls it 'Our Cooperative.'"

Li Furong talked about many facts that showed that cooperative members had truly realized the superiority of the cooperative: First, since the establishment of the cooperative, a technical research association has been organized, and new farming methods have been implemented: planting according to the land, fertilizing according to the land, wide ridges and close planting, and three thinning of seedlings. Second, labor systems such as fixed work, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed quantity have been implemented, giving play to labor enthusiasm and improving labor skills; equal pay for men and women has been implemented, mobilizing women to participate in production. The entire cooperative obtained a surplus of 755 workdays, carried out land processing and basic land construction (repairing field edges, building weirs, digging wells, digging lying ox pits, building reservoirs, etc.). Third, in order to strengthen the political and ideological education and cultural education of cooperative members, the cooperative subscribed to the Shanxi Daily, Shanxi Peasant News, North China People, Current Events Handbook, and Youth Women's Magazine, and established cooperative schools and clubs. "All these measures have made cooperative members realize that they cannot be done by individuals, nor can they be done by mutual aid teams. They can only be done by land cooperatives. This education in collectivism has made cooperative members feel that the cooperative is dear and lovely, and they naturally call it 'Our Cooperative.'"

Li Furong continued to talk. From his conversation, I gradually discovered the collectivist thinking generated by the cooperative members' love for the cooperative.

Li Nianliu is an ordinary cooperative member. After he fell ill, the cooperative members sincerely treated him as a relative. Li Nianliu talked to people about this matter, and said very gratefully: "After falling ill, everyone visited me once every day or two. When I didn't have money to buy medicine, the cooperative helped with loans. When I got better, a new difficulty arose: my family's labor force is weak, and I was sick for four months and did not go to the fields. My family of three only got sixty workdays, and the distributed grain was not enough to eat. What to do? The cooperative held a meeting to discuss this matter. Some people said: 'Anyone can get sick. Aren't we afraid of getting sick in the future? We should take care of his workdays.' Some people said: 'We should take care of him. Otherwise, what's the point of organizing? Isn't it the same as being a single-household farmer?' Some people said: 'Our cooperative is now moving towards the road of collectivization, and we should promote the spirit of helping each other in times of trouble and set an example for others.' In the end, everyone unanimously decided to take care of him for thirty workdays. It is truly the whole cooperative working as one, not afraid of disasters or illnesses."

When the cooperative was first established, Li Nianliu was not sure whether the cooperative could truly be run well. In order to leave a way out, he retained 20% of the private plot. Now, the cooperative's care for him has made him completely believe that the cooperative can be run well. One night, he said to his wife with a regretful tone: "We have retained too much private plot, which is not good for the development of the cooperative." His wife said: "That's right. If we retain too much private plot, we can only take care of our own work and cannot take care of the cooperative's work. If we take care of the cooperative's work, we cannot take care of our own work. As a result, both are delayed." They decided to reduce the private plot to 10% in 1953.

                         × × ×

November 8th and 9th were unforgettable days. Here, I saw the cooperative members' strong confidence in the future victory of the collectivist cause due to the growth of collectivist thinking.

On the 8th and 9th, cooperative members held various meetings to discuss the 1953 production plan. Cooperative Chairman Li Furong summarized the results of everyone's discussion:

"This year, the wheat suffered from hailstorms, but the autumn land can be abundant. Next year, we must strive for a comprehensive and greater abundance. The more than 200 mu of autumn land must increase from this year's average yield of 377 jin per mu to 481 jin, an average increase of 104 jin per mu. The more than 100 mu of wheat land must increase from this year's average yield of 180 jin per mu to 240 jin, an average increase of 60 jin per mu. What methods should we use to ensure the completion of this plan? Everyone is right, we must promote this year's abundance experience."

Li Furong talked about the issue of striving for abundance in 1953 based on the experience of abundance in 1952: First, we must plant according to the land, planting whatever is suitable. For example, sandy loam land is planted with corn, Er Yin Ao land is planted with hemp, black Lou land is planted with millet, and white sandy soil and red soil are planted with wheat. Second, we must fertilize according to the land, applying a large amount of fertilizer. In 1952, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu was 96 dan. In 1953, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu must be 120 dan. Third, we must strengthen basic land construction: adjusting 20 mu of soil, turning sloping fields into terraced fields 12 mu, irrigating 50 mu with floods, inwardly cutting and outwardly padding 140 mu, and plowing weirs and removing weeds 200 mu. Fourth, we must pay attention to farming techniques: sowing in a timely manner, planting improved varieties extensively, soaking and mixing seeds, removing diseased plants, implementing crop rotation, and plowing the autumn land five times, hoeing four times, and harrowing six times. Fifth, we must create 30 mu of high-yield land: 10 mu of autumn land with an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu (mainly planting millet), another 10 mu of autumn land with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and 10 mu of wheat land with an average yield of 550 jin per mu. Sixth, in addition to land processing, surplus labor should be invested in sideline production: raising 30 pigs, increasing sheep raising by 300, and raising 120 chickens.

"What methods should we use to ensure the realization of these conditions?" Li Furong continued: "Everyone is right: first, we must strengthen political and ideological leadership and continue to carry out collectivist education. To this end, one political instructor (the deputy chairman) is set up, and one study group leader is set up in each labor community. It is stipulated that there should be a class every other day during the slack farming season and once every seven days during the busy farming season. Increase subscriptions to Shanxi Peasant News by five copies, increase the number of reading groups by five, the number of propagandists by five, and establish one club and one achievement room. Second, launch a patriotic abundance competition. Implement the contract work and contract output system. Third, strengthen cultural learning. Establish a small teacher system, promote the quick literacy method, and require everyone to generally recognize more than 100 characters, 30 people to recognize more than 500 characters, 10 people to recognize more than 800 characters, and five people to recognize more than 1,000 characters, and 10 people to learn the four arithmetic operations of the abacus. Fourth, launch a movement to pay attention to technology. The technical group should promptly study and guide technology according to the season, and reward those who have achieved excellent results."

Mutual aid teams from this village and nearby villages sent representatives to participate in their meeting to discuss the plan.

The cadres of the cooperative talked about this matter very excitedly. They told me an interesting thing: When the cooperative was first established, some people in nearby villages said that they were "eating from the big pot" and "communizing." Some people even asked the county cadres who came here to help establish the cooperative: "I heard that Dongzhuang ate from the big pot. Are you eating a portioned meal there, or are you eating from the big pot?" Some people guessed in secret: "Maybe they are eating from the big pot. That saves trouble and avoids having to portion meals every day." However, since the cooperative was established, they have visited the cooperative's abundance evaluation and inspection and understood the various aspects of the cooperative. They completely understood what the cooperative was all about. Now, twelve mutual aid teams in nearby villages have requested to contact the cooperative. The cooperative has also taken the initiative to contact them, absorb them to participate in various meetings, and exchange production experience. Under the influence and help of the cooperative, they have gradually improved the mutual aid teams. Three labor exchange groups have become seasonal groups, five short-term mutual aid teams have become long-term mutual aid teams, and eleven mutual aid teams have carried out oxen cooperation, actively creating conditions to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives. Cooperative Chairman Li Furong said: "Next year, there will be seven or eight villages near us that will establish cooperatives."

    在一个农业生产合作社里
    古维进
    （续完）
    在村子许多地方的墙壁上，写着社员大会制订出来的各种制度：一、服从社内民主领导；二、爱护公共财物；三、不自私，不偷懒；四、先社后家（即先作社的活，后作自留地的活）；五、不背后乱说，有意见提在大会；六、遇事必须请假……李富荣社长说：“实行这些制度的过程，就是经常教育社员克服个体主义思想，树立集体主义思想的过程。保证这些制度实现的最好办法，就是大家根据自己的弱点订出爱国公约。”
    事实确是如此。
    在王金贵的家里，我看见墙上贴了一张爱国公约，上面写道：“每天早上不用人叫，按时起床，保证不脱一分工。”他的妻子李拐拐给我谈到他订立爱国公约的经过，她说：“以前做活好偷懒，太阳晒到屁股还起不来，过爱国检查日的时候，大家提出批评，他就订出公约要改正。”我说：“现在怎么样呢？”王金贵说：“自从在爱国检查日那天受到批评，我就首先作了一个检讨说：‘入社以前，我干活是顶勤快的，为什么入社以后干活就不大勤快呢？问题很简单，从前是给自己干活，现在是给大家干活。’大家说这种自私自利的思想要不得，我想了想，大家的话都是道理。假如大家都像我这样，社还能办下去吗？以后干活，我就完全照着公约上所说的去做了。”王金贵正说着，李海清和李海珍过来串门子，王金贵兴奋地给我说：“他们订了爱国公约之后，现在也改好了。”原来李海珍过去好在背后议论别人的是非，李海清好听他议论别人的是非，这样经常造成社员之间的不团结。他们在爱国检查日受到大家的批评，坚决表示要改正错误。李海珍对李海清说：“咱们定出爱国公约来保证吧。”李海清说：“早就应该这样。”李海珍定的爱国公约是：“保证不说小话。”李海清定的爱国公约是：“保证不听小话。”
    在成绩室里，我看见评比总结上表扬了执行爱国公约有优良成绩的人。李秃孩就是其中之一。他是饲养员，喂了十头牛，每头牛都喂得比他过去喂的牛好，没有生病，长的很胖。他很讲究喂牛的办法，他了解每头牛的食量大小，及时喂给适当的草料，勤打扫，多垫圈，牛圈里经常很干净，牛都住得很舒服。他在评比总结大会上曾经谈到他为什么要把牛喂好，他说：“自从当了饲养员，就感到责任重大。从前，自己的牛喂不好，最多耽误自己的生产，现在社里的牛喂不好，就要耽误全社二十户的生产。再说，咱现在‘以社为家’了，耽误了社的生产，还不是也耽误了自己的生产吗？所以我要负责把牛喂好。”另一个受到表扬的是李树荣。他是农具保管员，他要求自己和别人都要认真爱护公共财产，他和大家作了这样的规定：一、使用农具如有损坏，务必向保管人声明，以便修补；二、每种农具用完，必须磨擦干净；三、保管人要经常检查农具的件数，有无损坏，是否磨擦干净。农具在他的保管之下，很少有损坏和遗失等现象。
                 ×  ×  ×
    我从成绩室里出来，李富荣社长说：
    “你看咱社的成绩室怎么样？”
    我特别注意这样一个问题：开始办社的时候，人们都把它叫作“土地社”，现在许多人都叫作“咱社”了。当然这话具有很大的意义。为了详细了解其中的情况，我问李富荣道：
    “为什么现在大家都叫‘咱社’呢？”
    “因为社员都体会到社的优越性，大家便这样亲热地叫起‘咱社’来了。”
    李富荣谈到社员真正体会到社的优越性的许多事实：第一，办社以来，组织了技术研究会，实行了新的耕作方法：因地种植，因地施肥，宽垅密植，三次定苗。第二，实行了定工、定时、定质、定量等劳动制度，发挥了劳动积极性和提高了劳动技术；实行男女同工同酬，发动了妇女参加生产，全社获得余工七百五十五个，进行了土地加工和土地基本建设（修地边、垒堰、打井、挖卧牛坑、打蓄水池等）。第三，为了加强社员的政治思想教育与文化教育，社里定了山西日报、山西农民报、华北人民、时事手册、青年妇女杂志，办了社校、俱乐部等。“所有这些措施，社员都认识到不是个人可以办得到，也不是互助组可以办得到，必须土地社才能办到。这个集体主义事业的教育，就使得社员感到社的亲热可爱，自然地叫它‘咱社’了。”
    李富荣继续谈着。从他的谈话里，我逐渐发现社员由于热爱合作社而产生的集体主义思想。
    李碾留是一个普通社员，他病了之后，社员都真诚地把他当作亲人看待。李碾留对人谈起这件事，非常感激地说：“病倒之后，大家一两天就去探望一次，没有钱买药，社里就贷款帮忙。当病好以后，新的困难来了：咱家劳动力弱，咱又病了四个月没有上地，全家三口人才得了六十个劳动日，分下的粮食不够吃。怎么办呢？社里开会讨论这件事情，有的人说：‘谁也有病，将来咱就不怕病吗？应该照顾他劳动日。’有的人说：‘应该照顾。要不然，还算什么组织起来，还不是和单干户一样吗？’有的人说：‘咱社现在是向着集体化的道路走了，应该发扬遇事相助的精神，给人做个榜样。’最后大家一致决定给咱照顾三十个劳动日。真是全社成一心，不怕灾难不怕病。”
    刚办社的时候，李碾留摸不清社能否真正办好，为了留个后路，他留了百分之二十的自留地。现在社对于他的照顾，使他完全相信社是能够办好了。一天晚上，他带着懊悔的口气和妻子说：“咱们的自留地留得太多了，这样对社的发展是不好的。”妻子说：“可不是嘛，多留了自留地，顾了自己的活，顾不了社里的活，顾了社里的活，又顾不了自己的活，结果两头都耽误。’他们决定在一九五三年把自留地减到百分之十。
                         ×  ×  ×
    十一月八、九两日，是使人难忘的日子。在这里，我看见社员由于集体主义思想的增长而对未来的集体主义事业的坚强的胜利信心。
    在八、九两日里，社员召开各种会议，讨论了一九五三年的生产计划，李富荣社长根据大家讨论的结果进行总结道：
    “今年麦子遭了雹灾，秋地可丰产了，明年咱们要争取全面的更大的丰产。二百多亩秋地要从今年每亩平均产量三七七斤增到四八一斤，每亩平均增产一○四斤，一百多亩麦地要从今年每亩平均产量一八○斤增到二四○斤，每亩平均增产六○斤。咱们用什么办法保证这个计划的完成呢？大家说得对，要发扬今年的丰产经验。”
    李富荣谈到根据一九五二年丰产经验争取一九五三年丰产的问题：第一，要因地种植，长什么种什么。比方说，沙壤土地种玉茭，二阴凹地种大麻，黑耧土地种谷子，白沙土和红土种麦。第二，要因地施肥，大量施肥。一九五二年每亩地平均上肥九六担，一九五三年每亩地要平均上肥一二○担。第三，要加强土地基本建设：调剂土壤二○亩，坡田变梯田一二亩，洪水灌溉五○亩，里切外垫一四○亩，刨堰除杂草二○○亩。第四，要讲究耕作技术：适时下种，普植良种，浸拌种籽，拔除病株，实行轮作，秋地普遍耕五遍、锄四遍、耙耢六遍。第五，创造高额丰产地三十亩：十亩秋地每亩平均产量二○○○斤（主要种谷），另十亩秋地每亩平均产量一○○○斤，十亩麦地每亩平均产量五五○斤。第六，剩余劳力除进行土地加工外，投向副业生产：养猪三○只，增加养羊三○○只，养鸡一二○只。
    “咱们用什么办法保证这些条件的实现呢？”李富荣继续说道：“大家说得对：首先要加强政治思想领导、继续进行集体主义教育。为此，设政治教员一人（副社长担任），每个劳动小区设学习小组长一人，规定农闲时隔一天上一次课，农忙时间七天上一次课。增订山西农民报五份，增设读报组五个、宣传员五名、俱乐部、成绩室各一个。其次，开展爱国丰产竞赛运动。实行包工包产制度。第三，加强文化学习。建立小先生制，推广速成识字法，要求大家普遍识字一○○个以上，识五○○字以上的三○人，识八○○字以上的一○人，识一○○○字以上五人，学会算盘四则单位的一○人。第四，开展讲究技术运动。技术小组要按季节及时研究技术，指导技术，获得优良成绩者进行奖励。”
    本村和附近村的互助组都派出代表参加他们讨论计划的会议。
    社里的干部谈起这件事情，非常兴奋。他们给我讲述一件有趣的事情：刚办社的时候，附近村子有些人都说他们“吃大锅饭了”“共产了”，有的人还问来这里帮助办社的县干部说：“听说东庄吃了大锅饭了，你在那里吃的是派饭，还是吃的大锅饭？”有的人背地猜测道：“可能吃的是大锅饭，那也省事，免得每天去派饭。”可是，自从社办起来，他们参观过社的丰产评比检查，了解了社的各方面情形之后，完全明白社是怎么一回事情了。现在附近村庄就有十二个互助组要求和社里取得联系，社里也主动和他们取得联系，吸收他们参加各种会议，交流生产经验。他们在社的影响和帮助之下，把互助组逐渐提高。有三个拨工组变成季节组，有五个短期互助组变成长期互助组，有十一个互助组进行了耕牛合作，积极创造条件，准备办社。李富荣社长说：“明年咱这附近，就有七八个村子要办社了。”
