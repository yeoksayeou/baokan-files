    Struggle to Thoroughly Crush the American Imperialists' Germ Warfare Plan
    Yesterday, people all over the world heard a sound. This sound is the naked and bloody confession of the American imperialists in formulating and executing a large-scale germ warfare plan against the Korean people. Two captured officers of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing, Staff Colonel H. B. Huewe and Ordnance Officer Major Bley, moved by the lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese People's forces and compelled by the demands of their own conscience, gave testimonies that provided further irrefutable evidence of the American imperialists’ long-standing, large-scale murderous germ warfare crimes. Their confessions prove that the highest military organ of the U.S. government—the Joint Chiefs of Staff—had already formulated a plan for large-scale germ warfare in Korea as early as 1951, and issued instructions from Washington in October of the same year to be implemented by General Ridgway, then the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command. The publication of these documents further and completely shattered any attempts at sophistry and denial made by the American imperialist murderers over a long period. It once again irrefutably announced to the people of the world that the American imperialist war-mongers are not only the deadly enemies of the Korean and Chinese people but also the deadly enemies of the people of the world.
    According to Huewe's confession, the overall U.S. germ warfare plan in Korea was "instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951." This plan was delivered by "a special envoy from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Command (then General Ridgway) with an instruction ordering the commencement of germ warfare in Korea." The plan stipulated the trial use of various "different types of ordnance or containers, and using different types of aircraft" in "various possible areas or various possible combinations of areas" and "all extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures." It also stipulated that "depending on the results obtained and the situation in Korea, the field trials may be expanded into a part of regular combat operations." This plan was passed from Ridgway through U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland to the U.S. Fifth Air Force and began to be widely implemented in November 1951 on an experimental basis. The U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing first participated in this extensive mission, and then in May 1952, participated in the further regular combat mission of this plan: "Establishing a contaminated zone across Korea." Bley, who was captured at the same time as Huewe, also confessed to the supply and storage equipment part of the above plan. Both of their confessions stated that during the delivery and discussion of this large-scale murder plan, confidentiality was repeatedly and emphatically emphasized as "national policy." This proves that the American imperialist murderers not only carried out germ warfare according to a pre-determined plan but also planned to cover up and deny their heinous crimes.
    After the failure of the Korean war of aggression launched by the American imperialists, they prolonged the Korean armistice negotiations on the one hand, and formulated and implemented a germ warfare plan aimed at massively murdering peaceful people on the other hand. This unprecedentedly cruel and sinister crime has been fully confirmed by various international investigation groups, many individual investigators from various countries, countless eyewitnesses, and American prisoners of war who personally carried out the task of dropping germ bombs. In particular, the report and its attachments submitted by the International Scientific Committee, composed of world-renowned scientists from six countries, after on-site investigations, absolutely and accurately proved the fact of this inhumane germ warfare conducted by the American imperialists. However, facing the ironclad facts, the American imperialist murderers not only refused to stop their evil deeds but also brazenly denied them while continuing to spread germs more extensively in Korea and Northeast China, without any sign of restraint. According to the examples we published on February 21, in the two months from October to December 1952 alone, the U.S. invading air force in Korea dropped germ-carrying insects and various germ-carrying debris in Korea and Northeast China no less than ten times. This is actually only a very small portion of the total number of times U.S. aircraft dropped germ-carrying agents during the same period. Obviously, the American imperialists are relying on intensifying germ warfare in an attempt to salvage their shameful defeat on the battlefield, but the facts of more than a year since the United States conducted germ warfare prove that their shameless delusion can never be realized. The American aggressors dream of weakening the strength of the Korean and Chinese people through this way of war that massacres the people on a large scale, but it is precisely the American aggressor troops who are constantly clamoring about low morale and mass desertion, and it is they who are suffering miserably at Shangganling and Triangle Hill and are unable to advance or retreat on the Korean battlefield. The American aggressors want to rely on germ warfare as a magic weapon to save their failure on the Korean battlefield, but the Korean and Chinese people, inspired by the sacred spirit of patriotism, have mobilized and organized themselves to crush the germ warfare launched by the United States. Even those senior American military officers who planned and implemented germ warfare, according to Huewe's confession, had to admit that the effect of germ warfare was "worthless." Encouraged by the resolute struggle against germ warfare, the Korean and Chinese people not only crushed the enemy's germ warfare, but also greatly improved and strengthened the sanitary construction of their motherland in the struggle, improved the people's health level, and infinitely enhanced the people's high confidence in further and thoroughly crushing this insidious plan of the American imperialists. What the American imperialists could not achieve by relying on airplanes, artillery, and so-called "secret weapons," etc., the Vibrio cholerae, typhoid bacilli, anthrax bacilli, etc., can never achieve for them. Their further insane criminal acts can only arouse greater anger from the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world, and bring them greater and more thorough failure.
    In order to refuse to achieve a ceasefire in Korea, the American imperialists have been and still are shouting about what "humanitarian principles" and what "individual will" are aimed at forcing the retention of prisoners of war. However, for thousands of years, scientists and doctors have discovered and eliminated bacteria for humanitarian principles; for thousands of years, countless people with lofty ideals have tried to improve hygiene and eliminate diseases to improve people's healthy lives and enable them to realize their individual will for humanitarian principles. What do they have in common with the American imperialist murderers? They want to eliminate bacteria, but the American imperialists want to breed and spread bacteria; they want to eliminate diseases and improve health, but the American imperialists want to create plagues and spread death. In order to pursue the huge profits of a few people, for the most shameful desire of a small group of billionaires to enslave the vast majority of free people, the American imperialists do not hesitate to trample on humanitarian principles, attempt to destroy the will of freedom-loving people with man-made plagues and death, and use the scientific achievements of thousands of years to destroy true science and destroy mankind who are not enslaved by them. Moreover, when they do this in a planned way, they refuse to take responsibility for their criminal acts and dare not admit the facts. On the contrary, countless scientists, doctors, jurists, workers, students, farmers, poets, soldiers, and politicians stand up from countless corners of the world and accuse them of their crimes in unison; they turn a blind eye, betray their conscience, simply deny it, and absurdly say that they want to send their own groups and organizations to investigate, hoping to collect information and further deny their crimes. According to Huewe's confession, the reason why they are determined to deny their crimes is "more importantly to avoid letting our own people (referring to the U.S. side - editor) know, rather than concealing the facts from the enemy (referring to our side - editor)," because since "the germ warfare began, many pilots have become prisoners of war, so now the enemy (referring to our side - editor) must already know that germ warfare has been used." People may still think that the American imperialists have a guilty conscience here and dare not face their own people, but in fact, this is a major link in their conspiracy to expand the war. They want to deceive the people precisely because they can only drag the people into a larger war of aggression to die for the greatest profits of a small group of billionaires by blinding their own people.
    Although the American aggressors have suffered a heavy defeat on the Korean battlefield, they are still unwilling to give up and are actively trying to expand the war of aggression in Asia. On the one hand, they are instigating and funding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to harass the mainland of our country, clamoring about shameless platitudes such as embargo and blockade against us, and continuing to use the invading air force in Korea to invade our country's airspace; sending spy planes to invade the airspace of Northeast China for strategic reconnaissance; on the other hand, they are desperately promoting their "Asians fighting Asians" approach in other parts of Asia, and even trying to coerce Asians to die for their interests. Obviously, the United States first used germ weapons against the Korean people and the Chinese people, and conducted extensive experiments in various terrains and extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures, the purpose of which is to prepare to use the vast Asian people as the target for the United States to spread germs, create plagues, and spread death when the conspiracy to expand the war is realized. Therefore, the germ warfare that the American imperialists are conducting in Korea and China seriously threatens the lives and safety of all people in the entire Asian region, thereby threatening the lives and safety of the people of the world.
    We call on all peace-loving Asian people and the people of the world to immediately mobilize and take action to stop the American imperialists' inhumane germ warfare. All scientists with a sense of justice and politicians with foresight, all people who do not want to see plagues raging in the world have a responsibility to stand up and speak out against the American plague makers and spreaders' crazy plan to try to make the scene of the Black Death epidemic in Europe five hundred years ago reappear. The United Nations General Assembly, which is meeting in New York, USA, has an undeniable and unavoidable responsibility to condemn and stop the above-mentioned germ warfare crimes committed by the U.S. government in its name. The United Nations General Assembly should immediately take measures to require governments of all countries to ratify and abide by the 1925 Geneva "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" to ensure that germ warfare that threatens mankind will not appear again. On this day when the American imperialists continue to refuse to resume the Panmunjom armistice negotiations, continue to invade our country's airspace, and continue to systematically conduct brutal germ warfare against the people of our country, the people of our country must continue to intensify the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with thousands of times more effort, continue to vigorously intensify the patriotic health movement, and fight alongside the heroic Korean people to thoroughly crush the American imperialists' germ warfare plan!

### 为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战计划而斗争

    为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战计划而斗争
    全世界人民昨天都听到了一个声音。这个声音是美帝国主义者制定并执行对朝鲜人民进行大规模细菌战计划的赤裸裸的血腥供状。两名美国海军陆战队第一空军联队被俘军官，参谋长上校许威布尔和军械官少校布莱，在朝中人民部队宽待俘虏政策的感动之下，迫于他们自己良心的要求而作的证辞，对美帝国主义者至今尚在进行的、铁证如山的大规模谋杀的细菌战罪行，提出了进一步的不可动摇的证据。他们的供词证明美国政府最高军事机关——参谋长联席会议早在一九五一年即已制定了在朝鲜大规模进行细菌战的计划，并于同年十月自华盛顿发出指示，由美国远东司令部当时的总司令李奇微予以执行。这些证件的公布，进一步把美帝国主义谋杀犯长时期以来任何狡辩和抵赖的企图都彻底粉碎了。它再一次无可置辩地昭告了全世界人民，美帝国主义战争贩子不仅是朝中人民的死敌，而且是全世界人民的死敌。
    根据许威布尔的供词，美国“在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。”这个计划由“参谋长联席会议特派专人送给远东司令部总司令（当时是李奇微将军）一个指示，命令在朝鲜开始细菌战”。这个计划规定要在“各种可能的地区或是地区的各种可能的组合”和“一切极冷和极热的气温”下试验使用各种“不同种类的军器或容器，并使用不同类型的飞机”。它并规定“视所得的结果以及朝鲜的形势，可能把实地的试验扩大成为正规作战行动中的一部分。”这个计划从李奇微经过美国远东空军司令威兰而到了美国第五航空队，并于一九五一年十一月即以试验性质开始广泛执行。美国海军陆战队第一空军联队始而参加这个广泛性的任务，继而又在一九五二年五月参加了这个计划的进一步的正规作战任务：“横贯朝鲜建立一个沾染地带。”与许威布尔同时被俘的布莱也供出了上述计划的供应和储藏设备部分。他们两个人的供词都陈述在这个大规模谋杀计划下达和经过讨论的情况中，保密方面曾经被反复再四地作为“国家政策”而强调着。这证明美帝国主义谋杀犯们不仅按照预定计划来进行细菌战，而且按照预定计划来掩盖并抵赖他们的凶毒罪行。
    美帝国主义者在其所发动的侵略朝鲜战争失败以后，就一面拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面制定并执行了旨在大批谋杀和平人民的细菌战计划。这一空前残酷、空前阴狠的巨大罪行已经由各种国际调查团体、许多由各国来的个别调查者、无数亲见其事的证人以及曾经亲自执行投掷细菌弹任务的美国战俘们加以完全证实。特别是由六个国家的世界闻名的科学家们所组成的国际科学委员会在现场调查之后所提出的报告书及其附件，更是绝对精确地证明了美帝国主义者所进行的这一灭绝人性的细菌战的事实。可是，美帝国主义谋杀犯们面对着铁的事实，不但不肯停止他们的这种罪恶勾当，而且一面恬不知耻地矢口否认，一面更加肆无忌惮地继续在朝鲜和我国东北更加广泛地撒布细菌，至今没有丝毫收敛的迹象。就我们二月二十一日所发表的事例说，仅仅在一九五二年十月到十二月的两个月期间，美国侵朝空军在朝鲜及我国东北投掷带菌的昆虫和带菌的各种杂物已不下十余次之多。这实际上只不过占了在同一期间美机投掷细菌媒介物总次数中的极小的一部分。显然，美帝国主义者是倚靠着加紧进行细菌战来企图挽救他们在战场上可耻的失败的，但是，美国进行细菌战以来一年多的事实证明他们这种无耻的妄想是永远也不能实现的。美国侵略者梦想以这种大规模屠杀人民的战争方式来削弱朝中人民的力量，但是，整天叫喊士气低落、军队大批逃亡的却正是美国的侵略军队，在上甘岭和丁字山被打得叫苦连天，在朝鲜战场上进退不得的也就是他们。美国侵略者想倚靠细菌战作为挽救他们在朝鲜战场上的失败的法宝，可是，朝中人民却在神圣的爱国主义精神鼓舞下，全体动员和组织起来，粉碎了美国所发动的细菌战。就是那些计划和执行细菌战的美国高级军官们，根据许威布尔的供词，也不得不承认细菌战的效果是“屁都不值”。为对细菌战的坚决斗争所鼓舞了的朝中人民，不但粉碎了敌人的细菌战，而且在斗争中大大地改进并加强了自己祖国的卫生建设，提高了人民的健康水平，无限增强了人民进一步彻底粉碎美帝国主义者这个阴毒计划的高度信心。美帝国主义者倚靠飞机大炮以及所谓“秘密武器”等等所不能取得的东西，霍乱弧菌、伤寒杆菌、炭疽杆菌等等也决不能为他们取得。他们进一步丧心病狂的犯罪行为只有激起朝中人民和全世界人民更大的愤怒，为他们自己带来更大的更彻底的失败。
    美帝国主义者为了拒绝在朝鲜实现停战，曾经而且至今还在高叫着旨在借口强迫扣留战俘的什么“人道原则”，什么“个人意志”。可是，千百年来的科学家和医生们为了人道原则而发现细菌，消灭细菌；千百年来无数万的志士仁人为了人道原则而设法讲究卫生，消除疾病来提高人们的健康生活，使他们得以实现其个人意志。他们和美帝国主义谋杀犯们有什么相同之处呢？他们要消灭细菌，美帝国主义者却要蕃殖细菌、散布细菌；他们要消除疾病，提高健康，美帝国主义者却要制造瘟疫，散布死亡。美帝国主义者为了追求少数人的庞大利润，为了一小撮亿万富翁奴役绝大多数自由人民的最可耻的欲望，便不惜蹂躏人道原则，企图以人造的瘟疫和死亡来摧毁爱好自由的人们的意志，把千百年来的科学成果用于毁灭真正的科学，毁灭不受他们奴役的人类。而且，当他们有计划地这样做的时候，他们竟不肯对他们的犯罪行为负起责任，竟不敢承认事实。正相反，无数的科学家、医生、法学家、工人、学生、农民、诗人、战士和政治家们从世界的无数角落里站起来，众口一辞指责他们的罪状；他们却睁着眼睛，昧着良心，干脆否认，而且胡说要派他们御用的团体和组织前来调查，希图借此搜集情报，并进一步抵赖罪状。根据许威布尔的供词，他们决心抵赖罪状的原因“更重要的是避免使我们自己的人（按指美方——编者）知道，而不是对敌人
    （按指我方——编者）隐蔽事实”，因为自从“进行细菌战以来，许多驾驶员已成为战俘，因此，到现在敌人（按指我方——编者）一定已经知道使用了细菌战。”人们或者还以为美帝国主义者在这里是良心有亏，不敢面对自己的人民，殊不知这正是他们企图扩大战争的阴谋中的一个主要环节。他们要欺骗人民，正是因为他们只有蒙着自己人民的眼睛才能把人民拖进更大的侵略战争中为一小撮亿万富翁的最大利润去送死。
    美国侵略者虽然已经在朝鲜战场遭受到惨重的失败，但它还死不甘心，还在积极企图在亚洲扩大侵略战争。他们一方面策动和资助蒋介石匪帮图谋骚扰我国大陆，叫嚣对我禁运封锁等等无耻滥调，并继续不断使用侵朝空军侵犯我国领空；派遣特务飞机侵入我东北领空进行战略侦察；另一方面，又正在亚洲其他地区拼命推行其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的办法，竟图胁迫亚洲人为他们的利益而送命。显然地，美国首先对朝鲜人民和中国人民使用细菌武器，并要在各种地形和极冷极热的气温中进行广泛试验，其目的就是准备在扩大战争的阴谋得以实现时，以广大的亚洲人民作为美国撒布细菌、制造瘟疫、散布死亡的目标。因此，美帝国主义者正在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战严重地威胁着整个亚洲地区全体人民的生命和安全，从而也就威胁着全世界人民的生命与安全。
    我们呼吁一切爱好和平的亚洲人民和全世界人民立即动员起来，采取行动，制止美帝国主义灭绝人性的细菌战。一切有正义感的科学家们和有远见的政治家们，一切不愿看见瘟疫在世界上猖獗泛滥的人们都有责任站出来说话，反对美国瘟疫制造者和传播者们企图使五百年前黑死病流行于欧洲的景象重新出现的疯狂计划。正在美国纽约开会的联合国大会有无可推诿、无可逃避的责任，起来谴责和制止美国政府在它的名义下面进行的上述细菌战罪行。联合国大会应该立即采取措施，要求各国政府批准并遵守一九二五年日内瓦“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”，以保证威胁人类的细菌战不再出现。在美帝国主义者继续拒绝恢复板门店停战谈判、继续不断侵犯我国领空、并继续有计划地对我国人民进行残暴绝伦的细菌战的今天，我全国人民必须以千百倍的努力来继续加紧抗美援朝运动，继续大力加紧爱国卫生运动，和英勇的朝鲜人民一道，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义者的细菌战计划而斗争到底！
