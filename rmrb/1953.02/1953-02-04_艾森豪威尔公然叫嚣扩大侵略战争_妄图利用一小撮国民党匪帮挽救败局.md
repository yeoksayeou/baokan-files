Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Eisenhower, the President of the United States, in his State of the Union Address to the US Congress on February 2nd, openly declared that he wanted to "use military means to solve the Korean War," and said that this method would "inevitably affect" Vietnam, Malaya, and Taiwan. In other words, Eisenhower is determined to expand the war of aggression against Korea to the entire Far East. In his address, Eisenhower continued to crudely violate the principles of the United Nations Charter regarding the territorial integrity of any member state and indicated that the United States would not only continue to invade and occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan but also further encourage and assist the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang to harass the Chinese mainland, using them as tools for the United States to expand its war of aggression and further endanger peace in the Far East and the world.

Because the Chinese people smashed and eliminated the brutal rule of the US imperialists and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, over our mainland, making themselves masters of their own country, the US imperialists harbor deep hatred for the Chinese people and are determined to attempt a comeback, restoring their permanently lost rule over the Chinese people. In June 1950, the US government, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, announced the invasion and occupation of our Taiwan. The then-US President Truman issued a statement on June 27, 1950, openly declaring that he would use force to prevent the liberation of Taiwan. He ordered the US Seventh Fleet to "prevent any attack on Taiwan." Since then, the US government has not only actively strengthened its assistance to the Kuomintang bandit gang but has also directed them to constantly harass our coast and carry out various sabotage activities. Now, due to the shameful failure of the Korean War of aggression, the US imperialists are actively planning to expand the war of aggression, and Eisenhower has blatantly announced to the world that he will not only continue to invade and occupy our territory of Taiwan but also further intensify the use of the Kuomintang bandit gang to carry out aggression against the Chinese people. This act of aggression by the US imperialists, which is hostile to peace in the Far East and the world, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and will be met with the relentless blows of the Chinese people, leading to even greater failure.

This step by the American aggressors to expand their aggression is the result of careful planning. In order to save the defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, Eisenhower had long declared that he would formulate a Far East strategic plan with the main purpose of invading China. In this plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," employing the Kuomintang bandit gang is an important step. When Eisenhower visited Korea in early December last year, he specifically summoned Chase, the head of the US military advisory group stationed in Taiwan, for consultation. After Chase returned to Taiwan, he announced that the United States would strengthen its assistance to the Taiwan bandit gang in 1953 and said that the "business" of his advisory group would have a "great development" in 1953. Chiang Kai-shek also followed suit, clamoring to make "preparations for action" in 1953. Subsequently, the crazy war propaganda in American newspapers and magazines constantly published that Eisenhower would employ the Kuomintang bandit gang to carry out aggression. After the American aggressors were beaten black and blue by the Korean and Chinese People's forces on the Korean battlefield, they placed their great hope of salvaging the defeat in Korea on a small group of Kuomintang bandits who had already been defeated by the Chinese people.

This step by Eisenhower to expand aggression, in addition to once again exposing the extreme hatred of the US government towards the entire people of the People's Republic of China, will absolutely not scare the Chinese people who have already achieved victory. Even some figures in the US aggression group lack confidence in Chiang Kai-shek, this dead running dog. Agence France-Presse reported that "some people" in Washington doubted "whether Chiang Kai-shek really has the strength to attack the Chinese mainland." Agence France-Presse said that General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had long "poured cold water on the American official euphoria" about the dream of using the Kuomintang bandit gang to attack the Chinese mainland. Bradley pointed out that the Kuomintang bandit gang not only did not have "sufficient preparation" to attack the Chinese mainland, but also, if the Chinese people launched an offensive, "it apparently does not have the strength to protect Taiwan Island." Therefore, after the news that Eisenhower wanted the Kuomintang bandit gang to attack the Chinese mainland came out, the Taiwan bandit gang's "China Daily" quickly pleaded with its American masters to order the Seventh Fleet and nearby US naval and air force units to continue patrolling the Taiwan Strait and nearby waters, and demanded that the United States announce that Taiwan was under the "joint defense" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and the US army, in order to continue to prevent the Chinese people's offensive. The American "Washington Post" also predicted not long ago that the United States hopes to turn Taiwan into a "cornerstone" for carrying out aggression, but in fact, it will become a "millstone" "around the neck of the United States."

The fact that the US imperialists are building their hopes on such corrupt dregs as the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is a harbinger of its greater failure.

### 艾森豪威尔公然叫嚣扩大侵略战争  妄图利用一小撮国民党匪帮挽救败局

    艾森豪威尔公然叫嚣扩大侵略战争
    妄图利用一小撮国民党匪帮挽救败局
    【新华社三日讯】美国总统艾森豪威尔在二月二日向美国国会提出的国情咨文中，公然宣布“要用军事办法解决朝鲜战争”，并且说，这个办法“不可避免地要影响到”越南、马来亚和台湾。换句话说，艾森豪威尔决心要把侵略朝鲜的战争扩大到整个远东地区。艾森豪威尔在咨文中继续粗暴地破坏联合国宪章关于任何会员国不得侵害任何国家领土完整的原则，表示美国不仅要继续侵占我国神圣的领土台湾，并且要进一步鼓励和协助国民党残余匪帮窜扰中国大陆，利用他们充当美国扩大侵略战争、进一步危害远东与世界和平的工具。
    由于我国人民粉碎并消灭了美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石匪帮对我国大陆的残暴统治，使自己成了自己国家的主人，美帝国主义者就对我国人民抱着深刻的仇恨，决心妄想卷土重来，恢复他们已经永远失掉了的对中国人民的统治。一九五○年六月，美国政府在其发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，就宣布侵占我国台湾。当时的美国总统杜鲁门在一九五○年六月二十七日发表声明，公开宣称要用武力阻止台湾的解放。他命令美国第七舰队“阻止对台湾的任何攻击”。美国政府在这以后不但积极加强对国民党匪帮的援助，并且指使他们不断骚扰我国沿海，进行各种破坏活动。现在，由于朝鲜侵略战争可耻的失败，美帝国主义者正积极策划扩大侵略战争，艾森豪威尔就明目张胆地向全世界宣布他不仅将继续侵占我国领土台湾，而且还要进一步加紧利用国民党匪帮来对中国人民进行侵略活动。美帝国主义者这一与远东及世界和平为敌的侵略行动，必然要遭受全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对和中国人民的无情打击而归于更大的失败。
    美国侵略者这一扩大侵略的步骤，是经过了周密布置的结果。艾森豪威尔为了挽回侵朝战争的败局，早就宣称要拟订一个以侵略中国为主要目的的远东战略计划，在这个“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划中，起用国民党匪帮是一个重要的步骤。艾森豪威尔在去年十二月初访问朝鲜的时候，曾经特地将美国派驻台湾匪帮的军事顾问团团长蔡斯召去进行商谈。蔡斯回到台湾以后，就宣布美国在一九五三年要加强对台湾匪帮的援助，并且说他的顾问团的“业务”在一九五三年将会有“很大的开展”。蒋匪介石也跟着叫嚣要在一九五三年做好“行动的准备”。接着，美国的报章杂志上的疯狂战争宣传就不断刊载艾森豪威尔将起用国民党匪帮进行侵略。美国侵略者在朝鲜战场被朝中人民部队打得鼻青脸肿之后，就把他们挽救朝鲜败局的很大希望，寄托在早被中国人民打败了的一小撮国民党匪帮身上了。
    艾森豪威尔这一扩大侵略的步骤，除了再次暴露美国政府对中华人民共和国全体人民的极端仇视外，是绝对吓不倒已经取得了胜利的中国人民的。就是美国侵略集团中的某些人物，对于蒋介石这只死走狗也缺乏信心。法新社报道说，华盛顿的“某些人士”怀疑“蒋介石是否真正有力量进攻中国大陆”。法新社说，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷早就对梦想用国民党匪帮进攻中国大陆的“美国官方的兴高采烈泼过一盆冷水”。布莱德雷指出，国民党匪帮非但没有进攻中国大陆的“十足准备”，而且如果中国人民发动进攻，“它显然还没有力量保得住台湾岛”。因此，在艾森豪威尔要国民党匪帮进攻中国大陆的消息传出以后，台湾匪帮的“中国日报”赶紧哀求美国主子下令第七舰队以及附近的美国海空军部队继续巡逻台湾海峡及附近海面，并且要求美国宣布台湾是在蒋介石匪军和美国军队“联防”之下，以便继续阻止中国人民的进攻。美国的“华盛顿邮报”不久以前也预言过：美国希望把台湾变成进行侵略的“基石”，而事实上它将变成“套在美国脖子上”的“磨石”。
    美帝国主义者把它的希望建筑在蒋介石残余匪帮这样的腐朽渣滓上面，正是它将要遭受更大失败的预兆。
