Last year, two state-owned farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in the suburbs of Beijing—Shuangqiao Experimental Farm of the Mechanized Agricultural College (formerly Shuangqiao Experimental Farm of the Agricultural Machinery School) and Wulidian Farm—took the lead in launching a challenge in March 1952, initiating a patriotic production increase competition to state-owned farms, agricultural mutual aid cooperatives, and farmers across the country. The challenge stated, "We should take the lead and set an example in increasing yields per unit area," guaranteeing that the yield per mu of all crops sown by each farm in 1952 would exceed that of 1951, while also creating high-yield records for one or several major crops, completing and striving to exceed the 1952 increased production plan. Both farms focused primarily on cotton production. Shuangqiao Farm planted more than 800 mu of cotton, planning an average yield of 450 jin of seed cotton per mu (a 52 percent increase over 1951); the high-yield area of 30 mu was to average 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. Li Gongwen, director of Wulidian Farm, wrote an article (see page 2 of this newspaper, May 6, 1952), stating: "We are confident in completing the cotton production increase task this year (1952)"; and announced: Guaranteeing a yield of 550 jin of seed cotton per mu on 800 mu of irrigated land (a 156 percent increase over 1951); 450 jin of seed cotton per mu on 900 mu of dry land (a 109 percent increase over 1951); and an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu in the high-yield area of 10 mu.

“Cotton grew into hemp”

	In the early stage of cotton seedling growth, the stems were strong and the leaves were lush, which looked good. However, later on, the cotton bolls fell off a lot, and the cotton matured late, which was terrible. Seeing this situation, the masses near Wulidian said: "The cotton in the farm has grown into hemp!" (meaning the plants are very big, but don't grow cotton bolls). This criticism is worth pondering.

	After the cotton was picked, the competition failed, the "guarantee" fell through, and the plan was not completed. Shuangqiao Farm calculated the high-yield area and general land together, averaging just over 258 jin per mu, which was lower than the 1951 yield (296 jin per mu); the high-yield area averaged only over 508 jin per mu, which was more than 490 jin less than planned. Wulidian Farm yielded only 204 jin per mu on irrigated land and 289 jin per mu on dry land. The average yield of the entire farm, including the "high-yield area," was only 228 jin of seed cotton per mu, slightly more than the 1951 yield (an average of 215 jin per mu). Looking at the quality of the cotton, it was even worse: nearly half of the cotton at Wulidian Farm was frost-damaged cotton (flowers picked after the frost, with poor quality and unsuitable for spinning).

Reduced production is not due to dense planting

	Last year, both farms implemented dense planting for all cotton. Some people, therefore, raised the question: Was the reduction in production due to dense planting?

	The "high-yield area" of Shuangqiao Farm had 5,000 plants per mu and yielded over 508 jin of seed cotton per mu; one and two-tenths mu had 5,410 plants per mu, averaging over 554 jin per mu; the ordinary land had 4,500 plants per mu, averaging only over 250 jin per mu; and the nearby farmers planted about 2,650 plants per mu, averaging only 116 jin per mu. Although the natural conditions in 1952 were very poor, the cotton of the nearby farmers still increased compared with 1951 and 1950 (106 jin per mu in 1951 and 85 jin per mu in 1950), because it was planted much more densely than in those two years (1,800 plants per mu in 1951 and 1,500 plants per mu in 1950). These facts all prove that dense planting results in higher yields than sparse planting.

	Even in the case of high bud and boll drop, the benefits of dense planting can still be seen. The cotton planted by farmers near Wulidian and Shuangqiao Farms was sparser than that of the farms, but the bud and boll drop rate of the farmers' cotton was higher than that of the farms. In 1952, the boll drop rate of cotton at Wulidian Farm was 50 percent, and the boll drop rate of cotton from nearby farmers was 68 to 70 percent. Even if the bud and boll drop rate is the same, the cotton bolls of densely planted cotton are still more than those of sparsely planted cotton.

	From this, it can be seen that the failure of Shuangqiao and Wulidian Farms to complete their increased production plans in 1952 was not related to dense planting, and the basic principles of dense planting do not need to be questioned.

	So, what is the reason for the late maturity and high boll drop? The main reason is that various technical measures were not well coordinated, and there were errors or shortcomings in major tasks such as fertilization, irrigation, pruning, and pest control.

Only the form of split fertilization, but not the effect of split fertilization

	In 1952, Wulidian Farm applied 2,000 jin of soil manure, 150 jin of cottonseed cake, and 40 jin of calcium cyanamide per mu of cotton field as base fertilizer; and then applied 200 jin of cottonseed cake and 65 jin of superphosphate (very low solubility, only 1.8 percent soluble) as topdressing. Calculated, these fertilizers contained more than 26 jin of nitrogen, more than 24 jin of phosphoric acid, and more than 17 jin of potassium oxide. According to Soviet experience, each mu requires 24 jin of nitrogen, 31 jin of phosphoric acid, and 12 jin of potassium oxide to produce 500 to 600 jin of seed cotton. From this, it can be seen that not only was the amount of phosphate fertilizer applied by Wulidian Farm small, but even less was available for cotton plants to absorb. They knew that the quality of the superphosphate they used was not good, but they did not apply other phosphate fertilizers; moreover, they used all the superphosphate as topdressing and did not use some when applying the base fertilizer. In this way, the cotton seedlings lacked phosphorus in the early stage, which delayed the budding and boll formation period, and the flowers and fruits could not develop normally (the main function of phosphate fertilizer is to develop flowers and fruits). This is an important reason for late maturity and boll drop.

	There were also problems with the fertilization method. The base fertilizers of Shuangqiao Farm and Wulidian Farm were only applied during spring plowing with a disc harrow. In this way, the fertilizer was not easy to dissolve and decompose; restricted by the performance of the disc harrow, the fertilizer could not all be turned into the soil, and some was exposed on the ground. The reason why Shuangqiao Farm did this was that the fertilizer was not prepared in advance during autumn plowing; Wulidian Farm mistakenly believed that in order to ensure that the base fertilizer would have a fertilizing effect according to plan, it should be applied during spring plowing. The topdressing of Wulidian Farm was applied in two stages: the first application was 100 jin of unfermented cottonseed cake, which was ditched by machine after seedling setting and sprinkled into the ditch manually, applied to the ground with very shallow soil cover, and some fertilizer was even exposed on the ground. The second application was 100 jin of cottonseed cake and 65 jin of superphosphate, which were mixed and applied before the cotton plants flowered, using the same method as the first time. No watering was done after the first topdressing, making it difficult for the cottonseed cake to decompose and have an effect; the second topdressing was followed by watering, but then the rainy season began. The topdressing of Shuangqiao Farm's general land was applied in three stages (the high-yield land was applied in four stages). The first and second applications were also not watered, and the fertilizer could not be supplied for cotton plant absorption; the third application was followed by the rainy season. The fertilizer applied by the two farms did not work when the cotton plants needed to "develop stems" (grow branches and leaves), and when flowering and fruiting, it suddenly gained momentum, causing the cotton plants to grow many branches and leaves, with very few flowers and bolls, and prolonging the growing and maturing period.

Saying "light watering and frequent watering", doing heavy watering and torrential irrigation

	Li Gongwen, director of Wulidian Farm, said in an article published in the newspaper in May 1952: "After vigorous land preparation this spring, the cotton fields have basically been able to meet the requirements of 'light watering and frequent watering'." "We must achieve 'light watering and frequent watering' to provide the cotton plants with appropriate moisture." However, what they did was another story. They did not grasp the appropriate watering time and amount, and watered a lot at once, causing the cotton plants to grow "wild." After the first topdressing, watering should have been done once, and some workers raised this point at the time. However, the farm leaders believed that early watering was not good, fearing that early watering would cause early growth of branches and leaves, and the roots would not be deeply rooted. When watering began, because of the long-term lack of water and drought, some production teams were afraid that the water would not be enough, and once they had the opportunity to irrigate, they tried to irrigate as much as possible. The watering method was also flood irrigation, instead of using ditch seepage irrigation, which wasted a lot of water.

	Shuangqiao Farm also did not pay good attention to water use. They have suffered from drought and flood losses for several years, but they still have not paid attention to this issue. When it came time to sow, they found that the land lacked moisture, and they hurriedly worked overtime day and night to repair wells. The ground was uneven, inconvenient for watering, and was not leveled early. There was too much water in the low-lying areas, and not a drop of water was obtained in the high-lying areas. The cotton in the low-lying areas grew "wild"; the cotton in the high-lying areas was "thirsty" to death. When watering began, seeing the lack of water, they tried to irrigate the places that could be irrigated to "full." Later, they realized that this method was not good and changed to ditch irrigation in some areas; however, because the land was not leveled and the ditches were not opened evenly, some places still got more water and some places got less. The second watering began on June 29. They only saw that the cotton fields lacked water, but did not consider that the rainy season was coming. Immediately after watering, it rained for fourteen consecutive days. There was too much water in the field, the ground was uneven, the drainage ditches were not well dug, and the water could not be drained out. Later, they tried every means to pump water with small water pumps, but still, many cotton plants died; those that did not die also had overly lush branches and leaves due to too much water, making it difficult for moisture to evaporate, and coupled with cloudy days without sunshine for days, many cotton bolls on the lower fruit branches rotted; insect pests also occurred (cotton bollworms and other pests like to grow in dark and humid places).

Leave more fruit branches, less cotton bolls

	Whether the cotton pruning work is done properly or not is also closely related to the size of the cotton yield, the earliness of maturity, and the amount of boll drop. The pruning work of the two farms in 1952 was not done well. The topping (removing the tip) was done too late, and too many fruit branches were left. Shuangqiao Farm originally planned to leave seven fruit branches per plant; this was originally appropriate. Later, they repaired water wells, they thought they could water, and they should leave two more fruit branches. However, when the cotton was in need of water, most of the land could not be watered, and they still waited until eight or nine fruit branches had grown before topping. In this way, the fruit branches were many but lacked water, so they did not grow well. When there were already eight or nine fruit branches, the rainy season came; it rained for days, people could not enter the field, and the cotton grew "wildly." Later, although all the tops were cut off, the average fruit branches had grown to ten to eleven. Even so, they still did not pay attention to remedy, and did not hurry to cut off the group tips (removing the tips of the fruit branches). They only saw that the lower cotton bolls were still big, and thought they could fight for some more cotton bolls on the upper part. As a result, the nutrients were dispersed. Some cotton bolls did not get enough nutrients and fell off. The upper cotton bolls did not grow up before the frost period, and most of them died of frost; the lower cotton bolls did not grow well either. According to Beijing's climate, the frost period may enter in early October. It takes about twenty days for cotton from budding to flowering, and about fifty days from flowering to fruiting; the flowers on the upper part of the cotton plant take even longer. Therefore, the topping work should be completed before July 15. However, in order to "get one more flower and exceed the original plan," Wulidian Farm did the topping work in two stages on July 24 and 28. By the last flower harvest on November 15, many cotton bolls had not yet cracked.

No prevention of cotton bollworm, temporary hand catching is not enough

	Both farms suffered serious damage from cotton bollworms in 1952. Many flower buds were bitten off, and many adult bolls were damaged. The fruit branches in the lower part of the irrigated cotton at Wulidian Farm were bitten bare. Because of the occurrence of aphids and spider mites in previous years, they focused all their attention on controlling these two pests. After eliminating aphids and spider mites, they became paralyzed and complacent, and did not think that other pests would occur. When cotton bollworms occurred, they didn't even notice it at first, and didn't do a good job of prevention during the moth egg-laying period. Later, when they found out, they didn't know how to treat it, so they blindly sprayed 666 powder. However, because the larvae hid in the bracts of the flowers, the use of powder was ineffective. The situation became serious, and they had to mobilize all the staff of the farm and temporarily hire farmers to catch the insects by hand. They caught insects like this for two months, which not only lost many buds and bolls and consumed a lot of manpower, but also trampled the soil as hard as a path, making it impossible for the cotton plants to grow normally. Shuangqiao Farm also did not prevent cotton bollworms early and suffered great losses as well.

Cannot “Blame Heaven”

	It cannot be denied that the natural conditions in 1952 were worse than in 1951. The summer drought in June hindered the development of cotton seedlings. In July and August, when the cotton was flowering and hanging bolls, there was too much rainfall. The frost-free period in 1951 was longer, and the first frost was lighter; the frost-free period in 1952 was shorter, and the early frost was very severe. The pest damage in 1952 was also more serious than in 1951. However, these cannot be used as "reasons" for reducing production or failing to complete the increased production plan. The weather cannot be accurately predicted, but state-owned farms with scientific and technological knowledge and equipment should have a good grasp of the general laws of local climate change. As for pest damage, it can be prevented. When formulating the increased production plan, they should have anticipated the possible adverse situations and concrete measures to overcome difficulties. When the two farms formulated the production plan of "achieving a yield of 1,000 jin," they obviously did not do this. "The plan was blindly formulated"

	How were the increased production plans of the two farms in 1952 formulated? According to Fan Baokui, the production captain of Shuangqiao Farm: "That plan was blindly formulated." The workers also believed that the increased production plan of 1952 was "blowing the big cannon." They did not carefully analyze various specific conditions, did not truly grasp the various factors for increasing production, and did not seriously estimate the possible difficulties when formulating the plan. Naturally, they did not formulate practical measures to overcome difficulties. In the increased production plan of Shuangqiao Farm in 1952, it only said "strengthen scientific management technology, and under the conditions of deep plowing and dense planting, we propose the cotton production increase task for 1952." As for the specific content of "scientific management technology," it is not clear. When Wulidian Farm formulated the plan, they only thought: Qu Yaoli, a farmer, even planned to have three mu of land with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, and it would be too unreasonable for our state-owned farm not to formulate a 1,000-jin plan. Such a wish is naturally good; however, they did not even study Qu Yaoli's watering experience properly. The plan formulated in this way will naturally be unrealistic.

	When formulating the plan, they did not fully mobilize the workers to discuss, did not absorb the opinions of the masses, and did not turn the increased production plan into a plan of the masses. They said they wanted to "water lightly and frequently," but they did not even tell the workers the principle that "too much water is also bad for cotton." After the first topdressing, the workers of Wulidian Farm proposed that they should water, but the leaders did not listen. The workers are the ones who actually implement the plan. Since the increased production plan has not been turned into a plan of the masses, such a plan will naturally fail.

	The planned output of the two farms was to increase by one-third to one time compared with 1951, which has proven to be too high. Is there a possibility for the two farms to produce 1,000 jin per mu? There is such a possibility. But possibility is still only a possibility. To turn possibility into reality, there are still many specific conditions. The cadres and workers of the two farms did not have experience in striving for such high yields, lacked serious research on science and technology, and the plan was not carefully formulated, so failure was inevitable.

Violating the laws of nature will inevitably run into snags

	Judging from the technical errors and shortcomings committed by the two farms, they did not pay attention to carefully studying science and technology and mastering the laws of nature. Sometimes they were dogmatic, and sometimes they were empirical. In short, they lacked a scientific attitude and method and often acted based on subjective wishes. They also knew the principles of pruning, fertilizing, and irrigating in theory, but they did not combine these principles with the specific situation. The fertilizer allocation of Wulidian Farm was only based on the test report of the North China Agricultural Science Institute, which believed that the soil in North China was generally "deficient in nitrogen, slightly deficient in phosphorus, and not deficient in potassium." As for what the composition of the soil in this farm actually is? To what extent is nitrogen lacking? How soluble are the phosphorus and potassium contained in the soil? Can they be absorbed by cotton? They did not further carefully test and study. They also had a basis: In 1951, this farm (Wulidian Farm) applied 11 jin of nitrogen per mu and harvested 215 jin of seed cotton. To increase production by more than one time in 1952, the nitrogen fertilizer should also be increased by more than one time. This calculation method is also unscientific. They also did not study the combination of fertilizer and water enough. They only thought that watering later could "squat the seedlings" (make the cotton grow fewer branches and leaves temporarily, so that the roots can be deeply rooted downward), so they applied fertilizer without watering when the ground was very dry. They said they wanted to "water lightly and frequently," but they did not know that the correct method of watering lightly and frequently is ditch irrigation. They also did not have a good grasp of the technology of pest control. Based on their "experience," they believed that it would be all right if they treated aphids and spider mites. They were helpless when faced with the newly occurring cotton bollworms. The errors committed by the two farms in pruning were all based on subjective wishes. They wanted to leave more peaches to "exceed the plan" but ignored the laws of the season and ignored that cotton was to grow according to its own laws.

Finding the law from failure can turn failure into victory

	Farmers in the He Shouxiang mutual aid group in Jiugong Village near Wulidian Farm reflected: The farm has machines and science, but its yield is not as high as ours (their highest yield is 400 jin per mu). Some farmers also said: We can't afford to work as hard as the farm. Some workers on the farm also said: We did a lot more work, but we still didn't complete the increased production plan. The farm leaders only wanted to "complete the plan" but did not calculate the cost. At first, the sowing was too deep, and the seedlings did not come out. They spent a lot of work on soil removal, seedling transplantation, and seedling supplementation; they also spent a lot of work on catching insects by hand. Wulidian Farm calculated that it used more than 30 labor days per mu (the original plan was 19 labor days); Shuangqiao Farm used 21 labor days per mu, and the "high-yield land" used 20 more labor days. Many fertilizers and pesticides were also wasted. Overall, it was a loss (Wulidian Farm only calculated the cost of labor and fertilizer at more than 500,000 yuan per mu; pesticides, machine tillage fuel, machine depreciation, etc. were not included).

	This kind of waste of state and people's property cannot be allowed to continue. The two farms have now conducted preliminary inspections and discussions on the production situation in 1952 and are rectifying and improving from the management and technical aspects, so as to learn lessons from failures and further grasp the laws of nature. "If people want to achieve the victory of their work, that is, to achieve the expected result, they must make their thoughts conform to the laws of the objective world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice. After failure, people will also learn from failure and correct their thoughts to adapt to the laws of the external world. People can turn failure into victory. The so-called 'failure is the mother of success' and 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit,' is the principle." ("On Practice") We should keep Chairman Mao's words in mind.

### 去年发起增产竞赛的两个国营农场为什么战败了

    去年发起增产竞赛的两个国营农场为什么战败了
    燕凌  鲁生
    北京郊区有中央人民政府农业部直属的两个国营农场：一个是机械化农业学院双桥实习农场（过去是机耕学校双桥实习农场），一个是五里店农场。在一九五二年三月，这两个农场带头，和其它十个农场联合发出挑战书，向全国各地的国营农场、农业互助合作组织和农民发起爱国增产竞赛。在挑战书上，写着“我们应该在提高单位面积产量上起带头和示范作用”，保证每个农场一九五二年播种的一切作物每亩的产量都超过一九五一年，同时要创造一种或几种主要作物的高产量纪录，完成并争取超过一九五二年的增产计划。这两个农场都是以棉花生产为主的。双桥农场种了八百多亩棉花，计划每亩平均产籽棉四百五十斤（比一九五一年提高百分之五十二）；丰产地三十亩每亩平均产籽棉一千斤。五里店农场场长李恭文写了一篇文章（见一九五二年五月六日本报第二版），表示：“我们有信心完成今年（一九五二年）的棉花增产任务”；并宣布：保证在八百亩水浇地上，每亩产籽棉五百五十斤（比一九五一年提高百分之一百五十六）；在九百亩旱地上，每亩产籽棉四百五十斤（比一九五一年提高百分之一百零九）；丰产田十亩每亩平均产籽棉一千斤。
    “棉花长成麻了”
    棉苗生长的前一个时期，茎壮叶肥，看着倒是不赖。可是，到后来，棉铃脱落得多，棉花成熟得迟，这就糟了。五里店附近的群众看见这种情形，都说：“农场里的棉花长成大麻了！”（意思是说棵很大，可是不长棉桃）这个批评是很值得我们玩味的。
    棉花摘完了，竞赛失败了，“保证”落了空，计划没完成。双桥农场把丰产地和一般地放在一起算，每亩平均才收了二百五十八斤多一点，比一九五一年的产量（每亩二百九十六斤）还要低；丰产地每亩平均只收了五百零八斤多，比计划少四百九十多斤。五里店农场的水浇地每亩只收了二百零四斤，旱地每亩收了二百八十九斤。全场连“丰产地”在内，每亩平均只收了二百二十八斤籽棉，比一九五一年的产量（每亩平均二百一十五斤）稍微多一些。拿棉花的质量来看，就更不好了：五里店农场的霜后花（下霜以后摘的花，质量不好，纺织不好用）几乎占了一半。
    减产不是因为密植
    这两个农场的棉花，去年是全部实行密植的。有些人因此发生了疑问：减产是不是密植的过呢？
    双桥农场的“丰产地”，每亩株数是五千株，每亩收了五百零八斤多籽棉；有一亩二分地的株数每亩合五千四百一十株，平均每亩收了五百五十四斤多；普通地每亩都是四千五百株，平均每亩只收了二百五十多斤；附近农民每亩大约种二千六百五十株，平均每亩只收了一百一十六斤。一九五二年自然条件很不好，附近农民的棉花还是比一九五一年、一九五○年增产了（一九五一年平均每亩一百零六斤，一九五○年平均每亩八十五斤），原因是比那两年种得密了许多（一九五一年每亩一千八百株，一九五○年每亩一千五百株）。这些事实都证明了密植比稀植的产量是高的。
    就是在落蕾落铃很多的情况下，还是可以看到密植的好处。五里店、双桥两个农场附近的农民种的棉花比农场的棉花都要稀，可是农民的棉花的落蕾落铃率都比农场的大。一九五二年五里店农场的棉花落蕾率是百分之五十，附近农民的棉花落蕾率是百分之六十八到七十。即使落蕾落铃率一样，实行密植的棉花的棉桃还是要比稀植的多。
    这样看，双桥、五里店两农场一九五二年没有完成增产计划，和密植是没有关系的，密植的基本原则是用不着怀疑的。
    那么，成熟晚、落铃多到底是什么原因呢？主要是各种技术措施没有配合好，施肥、灌溉、整枝、防治虫害等主要工作都有错误或缺点。
    只有分期施肥的形式，没有分期施肥的效果
    五里店农场一九五二年每亩棉田上了两千斤土粪、一百五十斤棉籽饼、四十斤石灰氮做基肥；又上了二百斤棉籽饼、六十五斤过磷酸钙（可溶性很低，只能溶化百分之一·八）做追肥。这些肥料计算起来，含氮二十六斤多，含磷酸二十四斤多，含氧化钾十七斤多。根据苏联经验，每亩要求产五百到六百斤籽棉，需氮二十四斤，磷酸三十一斤，氧化钾十二斤。这样看，五里店农场所施的磷肥不但量少，而且可供棉株吸收的更少。他们明知道他们所使的过磷酸钙的质量不好，却没有加施其他磷肥；而且把过磷酸钙全部用作追肥，没有在施基肥时就用一些。这样，棉苗幼期缺磷，使孕蕾、结铃时期延缓，花果不能正常发育（磷肥的主要作用是发育花果）。这是迟熟和落蕾落铃的一个重要原因。
    施肥的方法也有问题。双桥农场和五里店农场的基肥都是在春耕的时候才用圆盘耙施下去的。这样，肥料不易溶解和腐熟；肥料受圆盘耙的性能限制，不能全部翻到土里去，有一些露在地面。双桥农场这样做的原因是秋耕时没有把肥料事先准备好；五里店农场则是错误地认为要使基肥按计划发生肥效，就应该在春耕时施下。五里店农场的追肥是分两次施的：第一次施了没有发酵的棉籽饼一百斤，是在定苗后用机器开沟，用人工顺沟撒进去的，施到地里盖土很浅，有些地方还有肥料露在地面。第二次施了棉籽饼一百斤，过磷酸钙六十五斤，是在棉株开花前混合施入的，方法和第一次相同。第一次施追肥后没有浇水，棉籽饼不易腐熟分解，不发生作用；第二次施追肥后就浇了水，可是接着就进入了雨季。双桥农场一般地的追肥是分三次施入的
    （丰产地是分四次施入的）。第一、二次施肥后也没有浇上水，肥料不能供给棉株吸收；第三次刚施完就到了雨季。两个农场施的肥料，在棉株需要“发棵”（生长枝叶）的时候都没有起作用，到开花结果时一下子使上了劲，使棉株突然生长许多枝叶，开花结铃很少，生长期和成熟期也延长了。
    说的是“轻浇勤浇”，做的是大水猛灌
    五里店农场场长李恭文一九五二年五月在报上发表的文章中说：“经今春大力整地后，在棉田中基本上已能够达到‘轻浇勤浇’的要求。”“一定要做到‘轻浇勤浇’，供给棉株以适当的水分。”可是他们做的却是另外一套。他们并没有掌握住适当的浇水时间和浇水量，一次浇了很多，浇了一次水就使棉株长“疯”了。第一次施追肥后，就应该浇一次水，当时有些工人也提出了这个意见。可是，农场的领导方面却认为早浇不好，怕早浇了早长枝叶，根扎不深。到开始浇水的时候，因为长期不浇，而且天旱，有的生产队怕水不够用，一旦得到灌水的机会，就尽量灌个饱。浇的方法也是大水漫灌，而没有采用开沟渗灌的方法，这就浪费了许多水量。
    双桥农场也没有很好地注意用水的问题。几年来他们都吃了旱灾、涝灾的亏，可是还没有重视这个问题。临到播种，发现地里缺少水分，他们才匆匆忙忙地日夜加班修井。地面高低不平，不便浇水，也没有及早平整。低的地方存水太多，高的地方一滴水也得不到。低的地方棉花长“疯”了；高的地方棉花“渴”得要死。开始灌水的时候，看到水缺，能灌水的地方就尽量灌“饱”。后来发觉这个办法不好，在一部分地上改成开沟灌溉；可是因为地没有弄平，沟也开不平，结果还是有的地方得水多，有的地方得水少。六月二十九日开始浇第二次水，他们只看到棉田缺水，却没有考虑雨季将要到来。刚浇过，就一连下了十四天雨。地里水太多，地又不平，排水沟没挖好，水排不出去。后来想尽办法，用小水泵抽水，结果还是有不少棉花死了；不死的也因为含水太多，枝叶过于茂盛，水分不易蒸发，加以连日天阴不见阳光，下部果枝上的许多棉桃都霉烂了；虫害也随着发生了（棉铃虫等喜欢在阴暗潮湿的地方生长）。
    多留果枝，少结棉桃
    棉花整枝工作做得合适不合适，和棉花的产量大小、成熟迟早、落铃多少也有密切的关系。这两个农场一九五二年的整枝工作都没有做好，摘心（去掉顶尖）摘得太晚了，果枝留得太多了。双桥农场原计划每株留七个果枝；这原是适当的。后来修了水井，他们就以为可以浇水了，应当多留两个果枝。可是在棉花正需要水分的时候，大部分地浇不上水，而他们还是等待长够八九个果枝的时候才打顶尖。这样，果枝多而缺水，就生长不好。到已经有了八九个果枝时，雨季来了；连日下雨，地里进不去人，棉花就“疯”长起来。后来虽然把顶尖全打了，可是果枝平均已长到十个到十一个。就是这样，他们还是不注意补救，不赶快打群尖（去掉果枝的尖端）。他们只看到下部的棉铃还大，就认为可以在上部多争取一些棉铃。结果，把养分分散了。有些棉铃得不到足够养分，就脱落了。上部棉铃没长大就到了霜期，大部冻死；下部棉铃也没有长好。按照北京的气候，十月上旬就可能进入霜期。棉花从现蕾到开花约需二十天，从开花到开桃约需五十天；棉株上部的花朵需要的时间更长。因此，摘心工作应该在七月十五日以前做完。可是，五里店农场为了想“多得一朵花，超过原计划”，到七月二十四日、二十八日才分两次做了摘心工作。到十一月十五日最后一次收花时，不少棉桃还没有开裂。
    没有预防棉铃虫，临时手捉已不行
    两个农场一九五二年都受了棉铃虫的严重危害。许多花蕾被咬掉了，许多成桃被咬坏了。五里店农场的水浇棉花下部的果枝被咬得光条条的。由于历年发生蚜虫、红蜘蛛，他们把防治虫害的注意力完全集中到这两种虫害上面了。消灭了蚜虫和红蜘蛛，他们就麻痹、自满起来，而没有想到还会发生其他虫害。棉铃虫发生了，最初他们竟没有注意，没有在虫蛾产卵期做好预防工作。后来发现了也不知道该怎么治，就盲目地用六六六药粉喷射。但因幼虫躲到了花的苞叶里，用药粉除治无效。情况严重了，只得动员全场员工、还临时雇了农民来用手捉虫。这样一直捉了两个月，不但损失了许多蕾铃，耗费了大量的人工，而且把土壤践踏得像小道一般坚硬，使棉株不能正常地生长。双桥农场也没有及早防治棉铃虫，同样受了很大损失。
    不能“怨天”
    不能否认，一九五二年的自然条件要比一九五一年差。六月夏旱，妨碍了棉花幼苗的发育。七、八月间棉花开花挂铃的时候，雨量却又过多了。一九五一年无霜期较长一些，初霜也较轻；一九五二年无霜期要短一些，而且早霜一来就很厉害。一九五二年的虫害也比一九五一年更为严重。但是，这些都不能作为减产或完不成增产计划的“理由”。天气无法精确的预测，但有科学技术知识和设备的国营农场，对于当地气候变化的大致规律，却是应当好好掌握住的。至于虫害，更是可以预防的。他们在订增产计划时，就应该把可能发生的不利情况和克服困难的具体办法预计在内。这两个农场在订“要达到一千斤的产量”的生产计划的时候，显然并没有这样作。“计划是瞎订的”
    两个农场一九五二年的增产计划是怎样订出来的呢？据双桥农场的生产队长范保奎谈：“那计划是瞎订的”。工人们也认为一九五二年的增产计划是“放大炮”。他们订计划时并没有细致地分析各种具体条件，没有确实地掌握各个增产因素，没有认真地估计可能发生的困难，自然也就没有订出克服困难的切实办法。在双桥农场一九五二年的增产计划中，只是说“加强科学化管理技术，在深耕密植的条件下，我们提出一九五二年的棉花增产任务”。至于“科学化管理技术”的具体内容究竟如何，并不了然。五里店农场订计划的时候，也只是想着：曲耀离一个农民还计划要有三亩地每亩产千斤以上，我们国营农场不订个千斤计划太不像样子。这样的愿望自然是好的；可是他们连曲耀离的浇水经验也没有好好研究一下。这样订出的计划，自然会是不切合实际的。
    他们订计划的时候，没有充分发动工人群众讨论，没有吸取群众的意见，没有把增产计划变成群众的计划。说是要“轻浇勤浇”，而竟没有把“水多了对棉花同样不利”的道理告诉工人。五里店农场工人在第一次施追肥后，就提出应该浇水，领导方面也不听。具体执行计划的是工人群众，既然没有把增产计划变成群众的计划，这样的计划自然要落空了。
    两个农场的计划产量都是一下子要比一九五一年提高三分之一到一倍，事实证明，这是提得太高了。两个农场有没有每亩产千斤的可能性呢？是有这样的可能性的。但可能性毕竟还只是可能性，要把可能性变成现实性，还要有许多具体条件。两个农场的干部和工人都没有争取这样高额产量的经验，对科学技术又缺乏认真的研究，计划订得也不周密，这样失败就成为必然的了。
    违反自然规律，必然要碰钉子
    从两个农场在技术上所犯的错误和缺点来看，他们是不注意精心研究科学技术、掌握自然规律的。他们有时是教条主义，有时又是经验主义，总之是缺乏科学的态度和方法，时常是凭着主观的愿望办事。他们从理论上也知道整枝、施肥、灌溉的原理，但是却没有把这些原理和具体情况结合起来。五里店农场的肥料配合，只是根据华北农业科学研究所的化验报告，认为华北的土壤一般的是“缺氮、稍缺磷、不缺钾”。至于本场的土壤究竟是什么成分？缺氮缺到什么程度？土壤中所含的磷、钾的可溶性如何？是不是能被棉花吸收？他们并没有进一步仔细化验、研究。他们还有一个根据是：本场（五里店农场）一九五一年每亩上十一斤氮素，摘了二百一十五斤籽棉，一九五二年要增产一倍多，氮肥也就要增加一倍多。这种计算方法也是不科学的。他们对于肥料和水的配合也研究得不够，只是想着迟些浇水可以“蹲苗”（使棉花暂时少长枝叶，使根向下扎得深），就在地很干的时候，施了肥，也不浇水。他们说要“轻浇勤浇”，却不知道轻浇勤浇的正确方法是开沟灌溉。他们对于治虫的技术也没有很好地掌握住，他们根据自己的“经验”，认为治了蚜虫、红蜘蛛就万事大吉了，对于新发生的棉铃虫就束手无策。两个农场在整枝方面所犯的错误，都是凭着主观的愿望办事，想多留桃以“超过计划”，而忽略了季节的规律，忽略了棉花是要按照它自己的规律生长的。
    从失败中找出规律，就能变失败为胜利
    五里店农场附近旧宫村何寿祥互助组的农民反映：农场有机器、有科学，还没有我们的产量高（他们的最高产量是每亩四百斤）。还有些农民说：我们要照农场那样费工，谁也赔不起。农场有些工人也说：我们多做了很多工，结果还是没有完成增产计划。农场领导方面只想“完成计划”，却不计算成本。最初播种太深，苗出不来，拨土、移苗、补苗，多费了许多工；用手捉虫，又多费了许多工。五里店农场计算起来每亩地用了三十多个工（原计划是十九个工）；双桥农场每亩地用了二十一个工，“丰产地”更多用了二十来个工。许多肥料、药剂也浪费了。总起来算是赔了本（五里店农场只是人工和肥料算起来每亩地就用了五十多万元；药剂、机耕油料、机器折旧等还未计算在内）。
    这种浪费国家人民财产的事，不能让它再继续发生了。两个农场现在对一九五二年的生产情况都作了初步的检查和讨论，正从管理方面和技术方面进行整顿和改进，以便从失败中取得教训，进一步掌握自然的规律。“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”（“实践论”）毛主席的这段话，我们应当谨记。
