Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 31st: The First Session of the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province sent a message of respect to Chairman Mao and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front.

To Chairman Mao's Message of Respect:
Respected Chairman Mao:

Under the brilliant light of your great national policy, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, have united unprecedentedly in the past three years. Today, representatives of forty-seven ethnic groups, including the Dai, Aini, Puman, Yao, and Youle, have gathered together to discuss their own important matters and established the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province. This is a day that our ancestors for several generations never dreamed of, and it is also the beginning of a happy life for our descendants. All ethnic groups are celebrating on the southwestern border of the motherland, blessing you: "Pazhao Aliya Mitai" (Dai language, meaning the Buddha of the Land of Ultimate Bliss).

Chairman Mao: At this conference, we passed the "National Unity Patriotic Convention" and the "Outline of the Autonomous Region People's Government's Work for the Next Two Years." In the future, we will be more united like a family, continue to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. We will strengthen the militia self-defense armed forces, assist the People's Liberation Army, eliminate special agents, consolidate national defense, and safeguard the victorious progress of the country's large-scale economic construction. Under the leadership and assistance of the higher-level people's government, we will gradually do a good job in production, trade, culture, education, and health, and improve the lives of all ethnic groups.

We firmly believe that under your wise leadership, we will surely achieve greater victories. We hereby extend our highest respect to you! Wish you good health!

To the Chinese People's Volunteers' Message of Respect:
Most beloved comrades of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

Today, on the southernmost border of the motherland, we formally established the "People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province." On the occasion of the joyous celebration by the people of forty-seven ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna for the establishment of their own government, we sincerely feel that this good day was obtained by your heroic fighting in Korea, defeating the American imperialist aggression, and safeguarding the security of the motherland.

Heroic volunteer comrades! In the future, we, the 200,000 people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, must learn from your heroic fighting spirit in Korea to combat American imperialist aggression, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, better organize the self-defense armed forces of our ethnic groups, and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to consolidate national defense. We must also strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, increase production, vigorously support you, and jointly strive to smash the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, safeguard the construction of our motherland, and the united and happy lives of the people of all ethnic groups in our hometown! We hereby send our highest respect.
