Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 12th: On February 9th, the US side, in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, again used new chemical weapons to massacre our captured personnel who were singing to commemorate the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army. As a result, 39 of our captured personnel were killed or wounded, including 13 seriously wounded. Two days before this, the US side had beaten to death one prisoner of war in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.

To cover up this inhuman new crime, the US side dared not announce the name of this new weapon, only vaguely and falsely claiming that it was a sprayed "irritant." However, American news agencies had to reveal that the prisoners of war were prepared to quickly wash off the "irritant" sprayed on their bodies with soapy water. Obviously, this is a corrosive toxic liquid that adheres to the human body. According to the US side, on February 9th, when the prisoners of war were singing patriotic songs outside the barracks, the US military systematically sprayed this toxic liquid on the prisoners of war three times. But the prisoners of war still sang unyieldingly. In order to use this weapon more effectively to massacre prisoners of war, the US side used grenades and weapon fire to drive the prisoners of war into the barracks, and then sprayed a large amount of toxic liquid to carry out the massacre. The US prisoner-of-war camp commander, Cadwell, openly claimed that the use of this chemical weapon was "effective," and said inhumanly that it was America's "extremely humane method." The US side announced that the "United Nations forces" carried out this massacre, which means that there may have been troops from Britain and other puppet states involved.

As usual, the US side described this massacre as a "demonstration" by the prisoners of war, but did not mention a word about why the prisoners of war were "demonstrating." But the US side cannot cover up the truth of the incident. The fact is very clear: this is because when the motherland's festival came, the prisoners of war once again expressed their loyalty to the motherland and their firm will to demand repatriation, and were therefore brutally massacred.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 12th: On February 5th, 7th, and 9th, the US side continuously used barbaric means to beat to death and injure a total of 41 of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. On February 12th, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the other side against this continuous barbaric atrocity of massacring prisoners of war by the US side. The full text of General Nam Il's letter of protest is as follows: To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

On February 5th and February 7th, your side beat to death two of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. On February 9th, your side again used grenades and poison gas against unarmed prisoners of war in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, killing and injuring 39 of our captured personnel. I lodge a serious protest with you against this series of barbaric atrocities by your side. This continuous series of heinous acts of abusing and killing prisoners of war by your side thoroughly exposes your side's ugly attempt to detain prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for the so-called "Asians fighting Asians," and exposes your side's planned conspiracy to overturn the armistice negotiations, expand the Korean War, and further undermine peace in the Far East and the world. Your side can never escape the serious responsibility for all these war crimes.

    美方在巨济岛用化学武器惨杀我被俘人员
    南日将军严重抗议美方不断屠杀战俘暴行
    【新华社开城十二日电】二月九日，美方在巨济岛战俘营内，又施用新式化学武器惨杀唱歌纪念朝鲜人民军建军节的我方被俘人员，结果我方被俘人员死伤三十九名，其中十三名受重伤。在这之前两天，美方在巨济岛战俘营内曾打死战俘一名。
    美方为了掩饰这一绝灭人性的新罪行，不敢宣布这种新式武器的名称，只是含糊其辞地谎称这是一种喷射的“刺激物”。但是美国通讯社却不得不透露：战俘曾准备用肥皂水迅速洗去喷射在身上的“刺激物”。显然，这是一种黏附人体的糜烂性毒液。据美方透露：二月九日当天，战俘在营房外高唱祖国歌曲之时，美方军队就有计划地对战俘三次喷射这种毒液。但是战俘仍高歌不屈。美方为了更有效地利用这种武器屠杀战俘，就用手榴弹和武器火力把战俘驱入营房内，然后喷射大量毒液进行屠杀。美方战俘营长官卡德维尔公开声称施用这种化学武器“有效”，并且毫无人性地说，这是美国的“极为人道的手段”。美方宣布：施用这种武器进行屠杀的是联合国军，这就是说：可能有英国及其他仆从国家的军队在内。
    美方照例把这一屠杀事件说是战俘“示威”，至于战俘为什么“示威”却一字不提。但美方是无法掩盖事件的真相的，事实非常明显：这是因为战俘当祖国节日来临之时，再次表示对祖国的忠诚和要求遣返回家的坚定意志，因而遭到了残酷屠杀。
    【新华社开城十二日电】二月五日、七日及九日，美方连续在巨济岛战俘营中以野蛮手段打死打伤我方被俘人员共四十一人。二月十二日，朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军对美方这种连续不断的屠杀战俘的野蛮暴行，向对方提出严重抗议。南日将军的抗议信全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    二月五日与二月七日，你方在巨济岛战俘营打死我被俘人员两人。二月九日，你方又在巨济岛战俘营对手无寸铁的战俘使用手榴弹与毒瓦斯，打死打伤我方被俘人员三十九人。对你方这一连串的野蛮暴行，我向你提出严重抗议。你方这种连续不断的虐杀战俘的罪恶行为，彻底地揭穿了你方扣留战俘充当所谓“亚洲人打亚洲人”的炮灰的丑恶企图，暴露了你方推翻停战谈判，扩大朝鲜战争，进一步破坏远东与世界和平的有计划的阴谋。你方决不能逃脱这一切战争罪行的严重责任。
                朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
                        首席代表南日将军
                      一九五三年二月十二日
