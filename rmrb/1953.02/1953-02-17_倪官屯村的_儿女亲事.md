Ni Guantun Village's "Marriage of Children"
    Lin Hong
    Editor's Note: The story of Bian Liqun and Bian Ronghua's marriage illustrates that as long as the man and woman are resolute in their will, and the district and village cadres actively support them and act correctly according to the Marriage Law, all difficulties can be overcome. Cadres in all districts and villages should learn from the example of the cadres in Ni Guantun Village, diligently study and publicize the Marriage Law, implement the Marriage Law, actively support the free marriage of young men and women, and persuade the elderly and those who misunderstand the Marriage Law, so that everyone can understand the benefits of free marriage and the harms of feudal arranged and mercenary marriages.

    In Ni Guantun Village, Second District, Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, there was a young couple who were in love with each other. The man, Bian Liqun, was the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch, in his twenties. The woman, Bian Ronghua, was a women's activist, nineteen years old. With the active support of district and village cadres, they overcame family obstacles and freely married in September 1952. The masses in nearby villages called this event the "Marriage of Children" in Ni Guantun Village.

    Bian Ronghua's father was a middle peasant named Bian Chunchang, in his forties. He had very strong feudal ideas, was unreasonable in his words and actions, and very bossy. His wife and children did not dare to disobey his will, and the villagers were also a little afraid of him. In this village, because the village cadres had a good understanding of the Marriage Law, women generally participated in production and various social activities, and the village's winter school and people's school were also well-run. In the spring of 1952, the Marriage Law was specially taught almost every Saturday. Bian Chunchang strongly disliked women participating in social activities. Although he didn't say it, he didn't want his daughter to participate in literacy classes. When digging wells for drought prevention last year, he also didn't let Ronghua go out to pull the pulley. However, Ronghua ignored her father's dissatisfaction and actively participated in literacy classes and various social activities, and was very enthusiastic about various tasks in the village. The village Communist Youth League branch had already decided to make her a development target. Bian Chunchang became even more unhappy. One day last spring, he discussed it with his wife and secretly found a husband for Ronghua, and accepted the groom's betrothal gifts, without registering with the district, considering it an engagement. Ronghua, because she had studied the Marriage Law in the literacy class, knew that marriage should be decided by herself, and that parents should not arrange it; and she also heard that the man was young and not a good person. Naturally, she was very unhappy. But she knew that her father had a violent temper, so she didn't say anything at the time, just cried in private. Whether at home or in literacy class, she was always in a bad mood. Bian Liqun, as the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch, often went to the literacy class. Seeing that Ronghua was always frowning, he asked her what was wrong. Ronghua's home was very close to his, and they were very familiar with each other. She had long had a good impression of Liqun, knowing that he was upright, worked very actively, and had a good reputation in the village. So, weeping, she told Liqun about her troubles, and said that she dared not speak, otherwise her father would beat her to death. Liqun listened and comforted and encouraged her in every way, and guaranteed that the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation would definitely support her. Ronghua felt that she had found a confidant. Later, whether she had difficulties in literacy or other things, she always went to ask Liqun. As time went on, Liqun saw that Ronghua loved him very much. Although he thought that Ronghua's father was very fierce, and he was a little afraid, because he loved Ronghua very much, he actively and proactively approached her. From then on, the two often talked together, worked together, and studied together, establishing a deep relationship. Soon, the two pledged themselves to each other for life. Last September, when the two talked about registering for marriage in the district, they immediately thought that Ronghua's father would definitely disagree, and that there would be many difficulties ahead. But both of them had a firm fighting will, and mutually expressed that they would risk their lives to fight for free marriage. If it couldn't be successful, then the man would not marry and the woman would not be married. The two also agreed that Ronghua would first find an excuse to stay at her grandmother's house, and then go to the district together to register when Liqun came to find her.

    After Ronghua left, Liqun immediately ran to Zhao Huichuan (female), the secretary of the village Party branch, hoping to get support. After listening to Liqun's narration, Zhao Huichuan believed that their situation fully complied with the provisions of the Marriage Law, and immediately expressed that she would use the power of the Party to support them. However, Zhao Huichuan knew that Bian Chunchang was very unreasonable and not easy to persuade. For the sake of prudence, she convened a meeting of the village's main cadres that night. After mobilization, everyone present expressed that they would conscientiously implement the Marriage Law, but they were all a little afraid of Bian Chunchang. The deputy secretary of the branch said: "We guarantee to act in accordance with the Marriage Law, but we must be prepared to be beaten." The cadres of the village Women's Federation said they were not afraid of being beaten. The village civil affairs commissioner reminded everyone: if the cadres sit idly by in this matter, a case of loss of life may occur. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed to actively support the free marriage of Liqun and Ronghua, and first try their best to persuade Bian Chunchang and his wife. Fearing that the village's strength would not be enough, it was also decided that each unit would send one person to jointly ask the district to send someone to help deal with this problem. Early the next morning, Zhao Huichuan, the deputy secretary of the branch, the village civil affairs commissioner, the village public security officer, the cadres of the village Communist Youth League, Bian Liqun, and others went to the district together. They were talked to by the secretary of the district office and Lou Ren, the director of the district Women's Federation. Both of them believed that Liqun and Ronghua's conditions complied with the Marriage Law, and on the spot encouraged them, believing that their active support for men and women fighting for freedom of marriage was completely correct, and agreed to send someone down to assist them.

    The active support of the district and village cadres encouraged Bian Liqun. The next afternoon, he braved the rain and ran to Ronghua's grandmother's house. Ronghua was very happy after hearing what he said, and immediately dressed neatly. The two of them went to the district together to complete the marriage registration procedures. As it was getting dark, Lou Ren, the director of the district Women's Federation, returned to Ni Guantun Village with them. Fearing that something might happen, the district and village cadres first placed Ronghua in the village Women's Federation, and then sent the village civil affairs commissioner and the director of the village Women's Federation to mobilize Liqun's father. Liqun's father completely agreed with Liqun and Ronghua's marriage, but was very afraid of provoking Bian Chunchang. He said: "As long as the cadres guarantee that nothing will happen, I have no objection." Several village cadres returned to the village office, and it was almost midnight. Zhao Huichuan immediately went to Bian Chunchang's house with the village's main cadres. Although everyone repeatedly explained the marriage policy and also educated him with examples, Bian Chunchang stomped his feet and cursed, saying that Bian Liqun had robbed his daughter, deceived his daughter, and also that the cadres had forced his daughter to register. Seeing his rude attitude, Zhao Huichuan said to him: "The policy has been explained to you clearly. If you dare to violate the law, we will handle it according to the law." Bian Chunchang still didn't listen, and hurried out.

    This mobilization and persuasion was not successful. Lou Ren, the director of the district Women's Federation, led the village cadres, carrying lanterns, to Bian Chunchang's house for the second time to explain. Bian Chunchang was not at home. Everyone explained the policy to his wife, and then returned to the village office to hold a meeting to study ways to break through the difficulties. Someone suggested: the Bian family is a large clan, so they could find the head of his clan and Bian Ying, a teacher from a neighboring village who usually gave him ideas, and let them mobilize him, which might have an effect. So the village cadres immediately sent people to find two heads of the Bian clan and Bian Ying overnight. The district and village cadres patiently explained the policy to them, but these three people had backward ideas and did not agree to free marriage. While they were arguing, they suddenly heard Bian Chunchang shouting and banging on the door. Everyone immediately ran out. It turned out that Bian Chunchang had gone to Ronghua's grandmother's house to find his daughter. He didn't find Ronghua, so he thought that Liqun must have taken Ronghua to his own home, so he was banging on Liqun's door. But Liqun's father was prepared and had already bolted the door. The director of the district Women's Federation and the cadres of the district armed forces severely stopped Bian Chunchang's barbaric actions. Several village cadres and Bian's clansmen went to Bian Chunchang's house together. The village cadres persuaded and mobilized him again and again, and Bian Chunchang finally proposed: he wanted to meet his daughter. As long as his daughter agreed, he had no objection. By this time, the east had already turned white. Regardless of their fatigue all night, the district and village cadres continued to resolve this dispute. Fearing that Bian Chunchang would beat Liqun and Ronghua, they first returned to the village office to arrange for people to protect them, and then went to invite Bian Chunchang and his wife. By this time, Liqun and Ronghua's marriage had already caused a sensation in the village, and the masses surrounded the village office. Everyone was discussing it, thinking that the cadres' handling was correct, and no one sympathized with Bian Chunchang. As soon as Bian Chunchang stepped into the village office, he said to his daughter: "When did you register in the district? Did Bian Liqun force you to go?" But Ronghua immediately replied: "I went willingly. I just think he's good, and I want to marry him." Bian Chunchang retorted: "Didn't I consult your opinion when I found that husband for you?" Ronghua replied "No," and exposed the process of his arranged marriage. Bian Chunchang said angrily: "If you didn't agree, why didn't you say it earlier?" Ronghua replied: "I didn't dare to say it, because I was afraid you would beat me to death." Bian Chunchang's wife, seeing that her daughter dared to talk back to her father, cried and made a fuss, scolding Ronghua: "You have no conscience. I raised you, and you are going to make your father die of anger today!" Bian Chunchang, seeing that he couldn't force her to submit, suddenly proposed that Ronghua was only seventeen years old and not old enough to marry. Ronghua immediately retorted her father: "If I'm not old enough to marry, why did you betroth me? You say I'm only seventeen years old, who can prove it for you?" The masses in the yard all answered in unison: "No one can prove it!" Bian Chunchang and his wife, seeing that this move had also failed, cursed Ronghua loudly, saying that they would no longer recognize her as their daughter. Lou Ren, the director of the district Women's Federation, saw that the masses had already clearly understood the right and wrong of the matter, and said to Bian Chunchang: "You have already asked clearly. Your daughter's marriage is autonomous and voluntary." Then she turned to ask Ronghua and Liqun: "When are you two getting married?" Both of them replied: "Today." That noon, the cadres and the masses helped them set up the auditorium, hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the elementary school students sang songs to celebrate the wedding. Almost everyone in the village ran to visit the wedding. The district and village cadres seized this opportunity to use this vivid example to conduct marriage law propaganda and education to everyone once again. From then on, this young couple became a happy and fulfilling couple. Many women at the time discussed among themselves and said: "Free marriage is really good, both glorious and money-saving; unlike in the past when our marriages were arranged by our parents, and two people had never even met once, and were forced into the same room, how miserable that was!"

    After the wedding ceremony was held, Ronghua's parents were still unwilling, and ran to Ronghua, asking her to take off her bracelet, and even trying to strip off her clothes. Ronghua immediately took off the bracelet and gave it to her father, saying: "I have a share of the land, and I still want to wear my clothes!" Under the instigation of Bian Ying of his clan, Bian Chunchang went to Lou Ren, the director of the district Women's Federation, and said that Ronghua and Liqun were close relatives who had not left the five degrees of mourning and could not marry. He asked her to write him a letter of introduction so that he could go to the district to accuse them. Lou Ren and the village cadres counted the genealogy of Ronghua and Liqun's families generation by generation for him, explaining that they had already left the five degrees of mourning, and repeatedly advised him: "Your daughter is already married to Liqun. Everyone should get along well and not make trouble." He did not accept it and insisted on going to accuse them. Lou Ren said to him: "If you must go to accuse them, you don't need a letter of introduction. You can accuse them anywhere." He still didn't listen and insisted on a letter of introduction. After the district and village cadres discussed it, they felt that if they were to write a letter of introduction, they should write down all the facts. After writing it, they read it to him and handed it over to him to take to the district to accuse them. When Bian Chunchang arrived in the district, he was criticized. But he still refused to give up and released rumors that he would smash Ronghua and Liqun to death. Fearing that something would happen, Ronghua and Liqun temporarily hid in a relative's house in a neighboring village for more than ten days. When the district found out, they felt that this would hinder production and work, so they let them return to their village, and at the same time let the village send people to protect them secretly. At this time, Ronghua's mother's thinking had been cleared, and she restored her old friendship with Ronghua. Under the instigation of Bian Ying, Bian Chunchang went to the Cangxian Prefectural Branch Court once to accuse them, and was criticized again. Finally, he gave up completely and restored a normal father-daughter relationship with Ronghua. Afterwards, Ronghua continued to participate in various social activities and actively went to the fields for production. Liqun also worked more actively and was soon promoted to district cadre. The masses in nearby villages praised them very much. After some time, the Cangxian Prefectural film projection team came to the Ni Guantun Village area to show "Marriage of Children." After many people watched it, they all said: Ni Guantun Village also produced a "Marriage of Children."

    倪官屯村的“儿女亲事”　
    林洪
    编者按：卞立群和卞荣花结婚的经过，说明只要男女双方意志坚决，区乡（村）干部积极支持，正确地按照婚姻法办事，一切困难都是可以克服的。各地区乡（村）干部都应该学习倪官屯村干部的榜样，努力学习与宣传婚姻法，贯彻执行婚姻法，积极支持青年男女的自由婚姻，劝说老年人和对婚姻法有误解的人，使大家都能明白自由婚姻的好处和封建包办买卖婚姻的害处。
    河北省交河县二区倪官屯村有一对互相爱慕着的青年男女。男的叫卞立群，是村青年团支部书记，二十多岁。女的叫卞荣花，是一个妇女积极分子，十九岁。他俩得到区、村干部的积极支持，战胜了家庭的阻挠，在一九五二年九月间自由结了婚。附近村庄的群众把这件事称为倪官屯村的“儿女亲事”。
    卞荣花的父亲是一个中农，名叫卞春常，四十来岁，封建意识非常浓厚，说话作事蛮不讲理，横得很，妻子儿女都不敢违抗他的意志，乡亲们也都有点怕他。这个村因村干部对婚姻法认识较好，妇女普遍参加了生产和各种社会活动，村里的冬学民校也办得不错。一九五二年春天，差不多每个星期六还要专门讲一次婚姻法。卞春常对妇女参加社会活动很看不惯，虽然嘴里不讲，心里总不愿自己的女儿参加识字班。去年打井防旱时，也不让荣花出去拉滑车。但是荣花不顾父亲的不满，积极参加了识字班和各种社会活动，对村里的各项工作都很热心，村青年团支部已经决定把她作为发展对象。卞春常就越发不高兴。去年春季有一天，他和老伴商量了一下，便偷偷地给荣花找了一个婆家，并收了男家的聘礼，也没有到区登记，就算是订了婚。荣花因为在识字班学习了婚姻法，知道婚姻应该由自己作主，父母不能包办；又听说男方年纪小，人也不好，心里自然很不高兴。但她知道父亲脾气很暴，当时也没有说什么，只是背着人哭。不论在家或上识字班，情绪总是不好。卞立群是村青年团支部书记，常常到识字班去，看见荣花总是愁眉不展，便问她是怎么回事。荣花家和他家离得很近，彼此都很熟识，她早就对立群有很好的印象，知道他为人正派，工作很积极，在村中很有威信。于是，她便一面哭泣，一面向立群诉说了自己的苦处，并且说，她不敢说话，否则她父亲就会活活把她打死。立群听了，便多方安慰和鼓励她，而且保证青年团和妇女会一定支持她。荣花觉得找到了知己，以后不论在识字上有困难，或者有别的事，总是去问立群。日子一久，立群看出荣花很爱他。虽然想到荣花的父亲很厉害，心里有点畏惧；但因自己很爱荣花，也就积极主动地去接近她。从此两人便常在一起谈话，一起工作，学习，建立了深厚的感情。不久，两人更互相许配了终身。去年九月间，两人谈到到区上登记结婚，立刻就想到荣花的父亲一定不同意，前面的困难很多。但是两人的斗争意志都很坚决，互相表示要豁出生命，争取自由结婚。万一不能成功，那就男不婚女不嫁。两人还谈好，荣花先找一个借口住到外婆家去，等立群去找她时再一起到区上去登记。
    荣花走后，立群马上跑去找村的党支部书记赵会川（女），希望得到支持。赵会川听了立群的叙述，认为他们两人的情形完全合乎婚姻法的规定，立刻表示要用党的力量支持他们。但是，赵会川知道卞春常很蛮横，不大容易说通。为了慎重起见，当天晚上她便召开了村的主要干部会议。经过动员，到会的每一个人都表示要认真执行婚姻法，但对卞春常都有点害怕。支部副书记说：“咱们保证按婚姻法办事，但咱们得准备着挨打。”村妇女会的干部说她们不怕挨打。村民政委员提醒大家：如果干部对这件事坐视不管，就可能发生人命案件。讨论结果，一致同意积极支持立群和荣花的自由婚姻，先尽力说服卞春常和他的老伴。恐怕村的力量不够，又决定每一单位派一人，共同到区上请求派人帮助处理这个问题。第二天一早，赵会川和支部副书记、村民政委员、村公安员、村青年团的干部、卞立群等便一同到了区上。和他们谈话的是区公所秘书和区妇联会主任娄韧。两人都认为立群和荣花的条件合乎婚姻法，当场鼓励他们，认为他们积极支持争取婚姻自由的男女是完全正确的，并同意派人下去协助他们。
    区、村干部的积极支持鼓励了卞立群，第二天下午他便冒着雨跑到了荣花的外婆家。荣花听他说了以后，也非常高兴，马上穿得整整齐齐的，两人一起到区上办了结婚登记的手续。天快黑的时候，区妇联主任娄韧和他们一起回到倪官屯村。区、村干部恐怕出事，先把荣花安置在村妇女会，然后派村民政委员和村妇女会主任等去动员立群的父亲。立群的父亲完全同意立群和荣花结婚，但很害怕惹下卞春常。他说：“只要干部们保证不出事，我没有意见。”几个村干部回到村公所，已经快半夜了。赵会川立即和村主要干部去到卞春常家。虽经大家三番五次地讲解婚姻政策，又结合实例进行了教育，但卞春常却跺脚大骂，说是卞立群抢了他的闺女，骗了他的闺女，又说是干部强迫她闺女去登记的。赵会川眼见他这种横蛮的态度，便对他说：“政策给你讲得清清楚楚，你要是敢违法，我们就要依法办理。”卞春常仍然不听，急急忙忙跑出去了。
    这次动员说服没有成功，区妇联主任娄韧又带着村干部们，打着灯笼，第二次到卞春常家去解释。卞春常不在家，大家给他的老伴讲了讲政策，又回到村公所开会，研究突破困难的办法。有人提出：卞姓是一个大族，可以找他本族的当家人和平常给他出主意的邻村教师卞英来，让他们去动员他，可能发生作用。于是村干部立刻派人连夜找来了两个卞族的当家人和卞英。区、村干部耐心地给他们讲解政策，但这三个人思想很落后，都不同意自由结婚。正争论间，忽然听见卞春常叫骂砸门的声音，大家立刻跑了出去。原来是卞春常跑到荣花外婆家找他闺女回来了。他没有找到荣花，便认为一定是立群把荣花带到了自己家里，因此正在打立群家的门。可是立群的父亲早有准备，早就把门闩好了。区妇联主任和区武装部的干部严厉制止了卞春常这种野蛮的行动。几个村干部和卞家的本家又一起到了卞春常家。村干部又再三说服动员，卞春常才提出：他要和闺女见见面。只要闺女同意，他没有意见。这时东方早已发白了。区、村干部不顾一夜的疲劳，继续解决这一纠纷。他们恐怕卞春常要殴打立群和荣花，因此先回村公所布置人保护他俩，然后才去请卞春常夫妇。这时立群和荣花的婚事早已轰动了全村，群众围到了村公所。大家议论纷纷，认为干部的处理是正确的，都不同情卞春常。卞春常刚一跨进村公所，便向他闺女说：“你什么时候到区上登记的？是卞立群强迫你去的吧？”但是荣花立刻回答说：“是我自己愿意去的，我就是看见他好，就是愿意和他结婚。”卞春常反问：“我给你找的那个婆家，没有征求你的意见吗？”荣花回答说“没有”，而且揭露了他包办婚姻的经过。卞春常生气说：“你不同意，为什么不早说？”荣花回答说：“我不敢说，怕你打死我。”卞春常的老伴看见闺女竟敢和父亲还嘴，便大哭大闹，骂荣花：“你没有良心，我把你养大了，你今天要把你爹活活气死哪！”卞春常看见硬扭扭不过来了，突然提出说荣花只有十七岁，不够结婚年龄。荣花立刻反问她父亲：“我不够结婚年龄，你为什么给我订婚？你说我只有十七岁，谁给你证明？”院里的群众都不约而同地回答说：“没有人证明！”卞春常和他老伴看见这一着也失败了，又高声咒骂荣花，说不再认她这个闺女。区妇联主任娄韧看到群众已经看清楚了事情的是非，便对卞春常说：“你已经问明白了，你女儿的婚姻是自主自愿的。”然后转过来问荣花和立群：“你们两人几时结婚？”两人都回答说：“就在今天。”当天中午，干部和群众便帮助他俩布置好了礼堂，挂上了毛主席像，小学生们在举行婚礼时还唱歌庆贺，几乎全村的人都跑去参观婚礼。区、村干部就抓住这个机会，利用这一生动的事例，再一次向大家进行了婚姻法的宣传教育。从此，这一对青年男女便结成了幸福美满的夫妻。许多妇女当时就互相议论说：“自由结婚真是好，又光荣，又省钱；不像咱们过去由父母包办，两个人一次面也没有见过，就硬塞在一个房里，你说那多么苦恼！”
    结婚仪式举行过了，荣花的父母还是不甘心，又跑去找到荣花，要她把镯子取下来，而且硬要扒她的衣服。荣花立即把镯子取下来给了她爹，说：“土地有我一份，衣服我还要穿！”卞春常在本族卞英的怂恿下，又去找到区妇联主任娄韧，说是荣花和立群是没有出五服的本家，不能通婚，要求给他写封介绍信，他要到区上去控告。娄韧和村干部把荣花和立群两家的家谱一辈一辈地数给他听，说明他们两人已经出了五服，并且再三劝他说：“你女儿已经和立群结了婚，大家应该好好相处，不要再找是生非。”他不接受，坚持要去控告。娄韧便对他说：“如果你一定要去告，不用介绍信，到那里都能告。”他还是不听，坚持要介绍信。区、村干部商量以后，认为要写介绍信，便应该把事实经过都写上。写了以后念给他听了，交他带上去区控告。卞春常到了区，结果受了一顿批评。但他还是不肯罢休，又放出空气，说是要把荣花夫妻两人砸死。荣花和立群怕出事，暂时躲到外村亲戚家十几天。区里知道了，认为这样会妨碍生产和工作，又让他们回到了本村，同时让村里派人暗暗保护他俩。这时，荣花娘的思想已经搞通了，和荣花恢复了母女的旧好。卞春常在卞英的怂恿下，又到沧县专区分院控告一次，还是受了一顿批评。最后终于死了心，也和荣花恢复了父女的正常关系。以后，荣花仍然参加各种社会活动，而且积极下地生产。立群也更积极工作，不久被提升为区干部。附近村庄的群众都很称赞。过了些时，沧县专区的电影放映队到倪官屯村一带放映“儿女亲事”。许多群众看了以后都说：倪官屯村也出了一个“儿女亲事”。
