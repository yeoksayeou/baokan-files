Pyongyang Celebration Rally's Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao

To the respected leader of the Chinese people and the esteemed Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely and wholeheartedly aids our just Fatherland Liberation War:

Today, as the Korean people commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of their glorious armed forces – the Korean People’s Army – we extend to you, our respected Chairman, the gratitude of the entire nation and the highest honors.

The young People's Army, under the wise leadership of the Korean people's respected leader and outstanding commander, Marshal Kim Il-sung, together with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, displaying unparalleled heroism, patriotic dedication, and indomitable perseverance, have repeatedly shattered the enemy's vicious aggressive attempts, gloriously defended the independence and freedom of the Fatherland, and made tremendous contributions to the great cause of safeguarding world peace.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, the outstanding sons and daughters of the 500 million Chinese people led by you, and the combat friendship and unity of our heroic People's Army, have been further tempered into an invincible force in the war against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples – the American armed aggressors.

The Korean people will never forget, for generations to come, the enormous assistance continually provided by the fraternal Chinese people, and the immortal achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in our Fatherland Liberation War.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong: Today, the American armed aggressors, disregarding their continuous defeats, are dragging the armistice negotiations toward rupture, in a frenzied attempt to further expand the Korean War. However, no aggressive attempts or military adventures by the enemy can stop the powerful unity forged in blood by the Korean and Chinese peoples in their long-term revolutionary struggle for national independence, freedom, and peace. The true armed forces of the Korean and Chinese peoples – the heroic People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers – will surely frustrate and crush any military adventures of the enemy.

The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the fierce war against the enemy, have remarkably strengthened their ranks in terms of quantity and quality, have been tempered and tested in combat, have gained rich combat experience, and possess inexhaustible combat power, having grown into powerful and modern armed forces.

Under the leadership of our people’s respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, all the Korean people will further strengthen the friendship and unity with the fraternal Chinese people in the future, and will more forcefully wage the struggle under the banner of the Republic to gloriously complete the historical and great cause of safeguarding the integrity of our territory and the unification of our Fatherland.

We are convinced that the just common struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples, receiving the warm support and sympathy of the peace-loving people of the world led by the great Soviet Union, will surely be victorious.

For the glorious victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples, the prosperous development of the People's Republic of China, and for peace in Asia, we wish you, our respected Chairman, a long and healthy life.

    平壤庆祝大会给毛主席的致敬电中国人民敬爱的领袖、诚心诚意地援助着我们正义的祖国解放战争的敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    今天，朝鲜人民在纪念自己光荣的武装力量——朝鲜人民军创建五周年的时候，谨向敬爱的您，致送全民族的感谢和最大的荣誉。
    年青的人民军，在朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖、卓越的统帅金日成元帅的英明领导下，与英勇的中国人民志愿军一道，发挥了无比的英雄主义与爱国的献身精神和不屈的顽强精神，接连粉碎敌人的凶恶的侵略企图，光荣地保卫着祖国的独立自由，对全世界维护和平的伟大事业作着巨大的贡献。
    您所领导的五万万中国人民的优秀儿女——英勇的中国人民志愿军，和我们英雄的人民军的战斗友谊和团结，在反对朝中两国人民共同的敌人——美国武装侵略者的战争过程中，已进一步锻炼成为不败的力量。
    朝鲜人民将子孙万代永远不忘兄弟般的中国人民不断地给予我们的巨大援助，和中国人民志愿军将士们在我们的祖国解放战争中建立的不朽功勋。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席：今天美国武装侵略者们不顾它连续遭受的失败，把停战谈判拖向破裂的道路，在疯狂地企图进一步扩大朝鲜战争。但是，敌人的任何侵略企图和军事冒险，也必定阻挡不了朝中两国人民在争取民族独立自由与和平的长期革命斗争中以鲜血结成的团结威力。朝中人民的真正的武装力量——英雄的人民军和中国人民志愿军必将挫折和粉碎敌人的任何军事冒险。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在激烈的对敌战争过程中，在数量上和质量上特出地加强了自己的队伍，在战斗中得到锻炼和考验，有了丰富的战斗经验和无穷无尽的战斗力，已成长壮大为现代化的强大武装力量。
    全体朝鲜人民在我们人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，今后将进一步加强和兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，一定要在共和国的旗帜下，为光荣地完成保卫国土完整和祖国统一的历史性的伟大事业，而更有力地进行斗争。
    我们确信：受着以伟大苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民热烈声援和同情的朝中两国人民正义的共同斗争必将胜利。
    为了朝中两国人民的光辉胜利和中华人民共和国的隆盛发展，以及亚洲的和平，谨祝敬爱的您万寿无疆。
