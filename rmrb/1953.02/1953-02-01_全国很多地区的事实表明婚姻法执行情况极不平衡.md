(Reported by this newspaper) In the period around International Women's Day on March 8th this year, all regions across the country will launch a large-scale mass movement to implement the Marriage Law, in accordance with the resolution of the Central Committee for the Movement to Implement the Marriage Law. This is because the implementation of the Marriage Law is extremely uneven across the country. A small number of regions have achieved success in implementing the Marriage Law, but many regions have not implemented it at all.

From the situation in various regions, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, some regions that were liberated earlier and have a better foundation for work have achieved great success. For example, in Lushan County, Henan Province, 150 out of the county's 188 townships have eradicated arranged and sold marriages. The relationships between husband and wife and among family members have become relationships of mutual respect, love, and assistance. Women are no longer discriminated against or abused, and have the same rights as men in the family. In terms of social opinion, arranged and sold marriages, child brides, and early marriages have been regarded as illegal. Men and women falling in love and widows remarrying are no longer considered "harmful to social morality." Women's participation in social activities has been regarded as a legitimate right, no longer subject to interference from husbands, parents-in-law, and social opinion. The political and productive enthusiasm of young men and women, especially women, has been greatly enhanced. The number of women going to the fields to work, participating in revolutionary work and various social activities, and studying culture has been increasing. Last summer, 80 percent of the women in the county worked in the fields, and every mutual aid team had women participating. They have become the main force in harvesting, hoeing, drought resistance, planting, and pest control. In the donation movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, women alone donated 510 million yuan.

However, in the vast newly liberated areas and some old liberated areas, the phenomena of arranged and sold marriages, child brides, early marriages, and abuse and murder of women are still very common and serious. Generally, men and women freely marrying and widows remarrying are still subject to interference from parents, parents-in-law, or the family, and pressure from public opinion. Some areas even have extremely barbaric phenomena such as "mortgaging wives," "renting wives," "exchanging wives," "bride kidnapping," "waiting-for-husband brides," and "hoping-for-husband brides." According to statistics from ten villages in Cang County, Hebei Province, out of 60 couples who married from January to October 1951, 51 were arranged by their parents. Among school-age children in four villages, including Wujiabao in Hejin County, Shanxi Province, 54 percent had already been engaged through family arrangements. According to statistics from three townships in District 1 of Ningde County, Fujian Province, there were 149 people renting wives, 159 mortgaging wives, and 5 sharing wives. In these areas, incidents of women being murdered or committing suicide by husbands and parents-in-law because they could not bear the abuse continued to occur. After a check on the implementation of the Marriage Law at the end of 1951, the barbaric phenomenon of abusing and killing women was reduced for a time, but in some places, because the fundamental problem was not resolved, it continued to increase since 1952. In Wenden Special District, Shandong Province, a total of 104 women committed suicide or were killed in the nine months of 1951, an average of 11.5 deaths per month; while from January to June 1952, 114 died, an average of 19 deaths per month. In Hunan Province, from June 1950 to June 1952, according to statistics from 36 counties, a total of 1,241 women committed suicide or were killed. According to statistics from 39 counties in the first half of 1952, the number of women who committed suicide or were killed reached 606. In Fujian Province, in the year and a half before the end of 1951, the number of men and women who died due to lack of freedom in marriage was 50 per month, but in 1952 it increased to 88 per month.

In these areas, many working personnel also have feudal remnants of thought to varying degrees, and have various erroneous and one-sided understandings of the Marriage Law, such as the so-called "implementing the Marriage Law will cause chaos in the world, mess up relations between men and women, and hinder social order," "allowing women to divorce will mean that poor and hired peasants will not have wives," and so on. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, they neither conduct propaganda and education on the Marriage Law among the masses, nor do they pay attention to the phenomena of arranged and sold marriages, child brides, early marriages, and beating and abuse of women that occur among the masses, nor do they support men and women who strive for freedom of marriage. Some cadres not only do not publicize the Marriage Law themselves, but also prevent others from publicizing the Marriage Law on the grounds that "the central task is busy." For example, the deputy district chief of the Chengguan District of Macheng County, Hubei Province, saw women's federation cadres mediating marital disputes and absurdly said to them: "If you engage in this ghost trick, you will not be able to complete the central task. You will be responsible!" Some cadres, mainly district and township cadres, do not act in accordance with the Marriage Law themselves, arbitrarily arranging marriages for their children or younger siblings, committing bigamy, early marriages, and abusing their wives, and arbitrarily insulting and attacking young men and women in love. For example, Li Wenhua, a clerk in the Wenming District Township of Tongchuan County, Shaanxi Province, sold his sister for four stone of wheat. Yang Chengwan, secretary of the Communist Youth League in the Jinzhen District of the county, and Zhou Qingyuan, secretary of the Communist Youth League in the Fifth Township of the district, exchanged their sisters to be wives. Sheng Hongqi, a woman from Jiupin Township, Dantu County, Southern Jiangsu, filed for divorce in 1951 because she had always had a bad relationship with her husband, and her husband agreed, but the village cadres obstructed her in every way and delayed processing it. Later, Sheng Hongqi fell in love with Wu Zhihua, a poor single peasant in the same village, but the village cadres held meetings three times to "struggle" against her, forcing her to commit suicide once. In the end, Sheng Hongqi was stripped naked, hung from the beam, and beaten to death.

Some cadres in judicial organs also proceed from feudal ideas when handling cases of women being abused, killed, or committing suicide, looking for reasons to exonerate the perpetrators and even failing to deal with them at all. For example, when the People's Court of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, accepted a case of beating a wife and stabbing her with scissors, it only sentenced the perpetrator to eight months in prison. The County Democratic Women's Federation raised objections, but the County People's Court ignored them on the grounds of "one matter is no longer dealt with." Wei Wangshi of Qingshi Township, Gaolan County, Gansu Province, died by jumping into the river because she could not bear the abuse of her mother-in-law and husband. Although someone went to the county to report it, the County People's Court refused to accept it on the grounds that "no one from her family reported it." This situation has fueled the atmosphere of abusing women. Another example is Sun Zhaohan, an assessor of the People's Court of Beijing, who, when handling the case of Wu Yuan's request for divorce due to her husband's abuse, believed that it was only a "quarrel between husband and wife." After letting her husband, Wu Baokun, make a statement that he would no longer beat his wife, he believed that the problem had been resolved and asked Wu Yuan to withdraw the lawsuit. As a result, Wu Yuan died by jumping into a well after returning home because she was abused and coerced by her husband again.

Cadres with such strong feudal ideas also made extremely incorrect handling of the property issues of divorced women, the legitimate rights of children, and the property issues of widows remarrying. They wrongly believed that allowing women to divorce was already a "loss" for the man, and if the woman was awarded the property or living expenses she deserved, the man would be "empty of both money and people." Some cadres of the People's Courts believe that in all cases where the woman files for divorce, she should not be awarded property or living expenses. Some People's Courts do not award the woman the property and living expenses she deserves, regardless of who files for divorce; even if they do, they do not seriously enforce it. In addition, the local district and village cadres obstruct in every way, making the judgment even more difficult to enforce. The Judicial Section of Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, found in the judicial reform movement that in 170 divorce cases judged in the county, 135 had not awarded the women the property they deserved. When Tianjin City checked the implementation of the Marriage Law at the end of 1951, it checked 95 divorce cases, of which 72 were filed by women, and 54 did not award the women living expenses. The consequences of this behavior of disregarding women's legitimate rights are also extremely serious. Some places have seen incidents of women committing suicide because they could not survive after divorce. Or divorced women are forced by life to remarry hastily and fall back into pain. For example, Huang Lanhua, a woman from Kengdong Village, District 1, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, was married to Yang Yan'er by her parents from an early age. For more than ten years, the relationship between the two parties was very bad, and they lived a painful life. In the winter of 1950, after mediation by the District Office of District 1, she and Yang Yan'er divorced, and she was ostensibly given two houses and three mu of land, but she did not receive any of them. Because she had no way to live, she was sold to Ning Jindou by her parents as his wife in 1951. After marriage, she was still beaten and abused, forcing her to jump into a well and commit suicide, but she did not die. Later, with the approval of the Civil Affairs Section of Jishan County, she and Ning Jindou divorced, but she was not awarded any property. She had repeatedly gone to the district and county to request the recovery of the property she had been divided with Yang Yan'er when they divorced, but to no avail. It was not until the judicial reform last year that her problem was properly handled.

Many political and legal organs and women's federations adopt an attitude of procrastination and perfunctoriness towards marriage issues, or make things difficult in every way on the grounds that there is no letter of introduction or that the conditions are not sufficient, so that a large number of marriage cases are backlogged and cannot be dealt with, causing women who strive for freedom of marriage to despair because they cannot survive, commit suicide, or are forced to return to their in-laws' home and be killed. According to a survey in Guangdong Province in June 1952 alone, 79 counties had a total backlog of 11,259 marriage cases, of which there were 235 cases of women being abused and murdered due to marriage problems or other reasons, and more than 9,300 divorce cases.

The above situations fully show that although the implementation of the Marriage Law has achieved considerable success, it has not yet been fully and correctly implemented. Therefore, Party and government organs at all levels and people's organizations such as women's federations should continue to actively strive to implement the Marriage Law.

### 全国很多地区的事实表明婚姻法执行情况极不平衡

    全国很多地区的事实表明婚姻法执行情况极不平衡
    【本报讯】今年“三八”妇女节前后，全国各地将根据中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会的决议，开展一个大规模的贯彻婚姻法的群众运动。这是因为婚姻法在全国各地执行的情况极不平衡。少数地区执行婚姻法有成绩，很多地区根本没有贯彻执行。
    从各地的情况来看，自婚姻法颁布以来，一部分解放较早和工作基础较好的地区已经取得了很大的成绩。如河南省鲁山县，全县一百八十八个乡中，已有一百五十个乡根绝了包办买卖婚姻。夫妻之间和家庭成员之间的关系，已成为互敬互爱、互相帮助的关系。妇女已不再受歧视和虐待，在家庭中和男子有着同样的权利。在社会舆论上，包办买卖婚姻、童养媳和早婚等现象已被视为非法，男女恋爱和寡妇改嫁已不再被认为“有伤风化”，妇女参加社会活动已被认为正当权利，不再受丈夫、公婆和社会舆论的干涉，青壮年男女特别是妇女群众的政治积极性和生产积极性大大提高，妇女下地生产、参加革命工作和各种社会活动以及学习文化的日益增多。去年夏季，该县有百分之八十的妇女下地劳动，全县每一互助组都有妇女参加，她们已成为收割、锄地、抗旱点种和治虫中的主要力量。在抗美援朝的捐献运动中，仅妇女就捐了五亿一千万元。
    但在广大的新解放区和一部分老解放区，包办、买卖婚姻、童养媳、早婚和虐待杀害妇女的现象仍然十分普遍而严重。一般男女自由结婚和寡妇结婚，仍然受到父母公婆或本家的干涉和舆论的压迫。有些地区甚至还存在着“典妻”、“租妻”、“换妻”、“抢亲”、“等郎媳”、“望郎媳”等极端野蛮的现象。据河北省沧县十个村统计，从一九五一年一月到十月共有结婚的六十对，其中由父母包办的就有五十一对。山西省河津县武家堡等四个村的学龄儿童中，有百分之五十四已经由家庭包办订了婚。福建省宁德县一区三个乡统计，租妻的有一百四十九人，典妻的有一百五十九人，伙妻的有五人。在这种地区，妇女因不堪虐待而要求离婚被丈夫公婆杀害或自杀的事件不断发生。经过一九五一年底对婚姻法执行情况进行一次检查，虐杀妇女的野蛮现象虽曾一度减少，但有些地方因根本问题没有解决，一九五二年以来又继续增加。山东省文登专区一九五一年九个月中共有一百零四个妇女自杀或被杀，平均每月死十一个半；而一九五二年一至六月就死了一百一十四个，平均每月死十九个。湖南省自一九五○年六月至一九五二年六月的两年间，据三十六个县统计，自杀被杀的妇女共一千二百四十一人，而据一九五二年上半年三十九个县统计，自杀被杀的妇女即达六百零六人。福建省一九五一年底以前的一年半内，因婚姻不自由而死的男女为每月五十人，一九五二年竟增至每月八十八人。
    在这些地区，有不少工作人员也存在着不同程度的封建残余思想，对婚姻法有着各种错误的和片面的了解，如所谓“实行婚姻法就会天下大乱，乱搞男女关系，妨碍社会治安”，“准许女人离婚就要弄得贫雇农没有老婆”等等。在这种错误思想支配下，他们既不向群众进行婚姻法的宣传教育，对于群众中发生的包办、买卖婚姻、童养媳、早婚和打骂虐待妇女的现象也不过问，对于争取婚姻自由的男女也不加支持。有些干部不仅自己不宣传婚姻法，还借口“中心工作忙”，阻止别人宣传婚姻法。例如湖北省麻城县城关区的副区长，看见妇联干部调解婚姻纠纷，便荒谬地对她们说：“你们搞这鬼名堂，中心工作完不成任务，由你们负责！”有一些干部，主要是区乡干部，自己就不按婚姻法办事，随意包办子女或弟妹的婚姻、重婚、早婚和虐待妻子，对于恋爱中的青年男女则任意侮辱、打击。如陕西省铜川县文明区乡文书李文华，把他妹子卖了四石麦子。该县金镇区青年团书记杨成万和该区五乡青年团书记周青元，互相交换自己的妹子作妻子。苏南丹徒县九品乡妇女盛红奇，因与丈夫一贯感情不好，于一九五一年提出离婚，她丈夫也同意，但村干部却多方阻挠，一直拖延不处理。后盛红奇与同村贫农单身汉巫之华发生爱情，村干部却三次开会“斗争”她，逼得她自杀一次。最后竟将盛红奇衣服剥光，吊在梁上毒打而死。
    有一些司法机关的干部，在处理妇女被虐待或被杀自杀的案件时，也是从封建思想出发，多方找寻理由来为凶犯开脱责任，甚至根本不予处理。例如陕西省长安县人民法院在受理一件毒打妻子并用剪刀刺杀妻子的案件时，仅仅判了凶犯八个月的徒刑。县民主妇女联合会提出意见，县人民法院却以“一事不再理”为借口，置之不理。甘肃省皋兰县青石乡魏王氏，因不堪婆婆和丈夫虐待投河而死，虽有人到县告发，但该县人民法院却以“娘家没人告”为理由，不予受理。这种情形，助长了虐待妇女的风气。又如北京市人民法院助审员孙兆瀚，在处理吴袁氏因不堪丈夫虐待要求离婚的案件时，认为只是“夫妻口角”，让其夫吴宝崑具结不再打老婆后，便认为问题已经解决，要吴袁氏撤回诉讼。结果吴袁氏在回家后因又受其夫的虐待和威逼，便投井而死。
    具有这种浓厚封建思想的干部，对于离婚妇女的财产问题，子女的正当权利，以及寡妇改嫁的财产问题，同样作了极不正确的处理。他们错误地认为，允许妇女离婚已经是男方的“损失”，如果再判给女方应得的财产或生活费，男方便会“人财两空”。有些人民法院的干部认为，凡是女方提出离婚的，就不应判给财产或生活费。有的人民法院则是不管那方提出离婚，都不判给女方应得财产和生活费；即使判给，也不认真执行。加上当地区村干部多方阻难，判决就更难执行了。山西省高平县司法科在司法改革运动中检查出该县所判决的一百七十件离婚案中，便有一百三十五件未判给女方应得的财产。天津市在一九五一年底检查婚姻法执行情况时，曾检查了九十五个离婚案件，其中女方提出的七十二件，有五十四件没有判给女方生活费。这种漠视妇女正当权利的行为所产生的后果也是极其严重的。有些地方就曾经发生过妇女离婚后无法生活而自杀的事件。或者离婚妇女为生活所迫，又草率结婚、重新陷入痛苦之中。例如山西省稷山县一区坑东村妇女黄兰花，从小由父母包办和杨彦儿结了婚，十几年来双方感情非常不好，过着痛苦的日子。一九五○年冬经一区区公所调解，她和杨彦儿离了婚，表面上分给她两间房子三亩地，但她都没有得到。因生活没有办法，一九五一年又被父母卖给寗金斗为妻。婚后仍受打骂，逼得跳井自杀，未死。后经稷山县民政科批准她和寗金斗离了婚，但同样没有判给她财产。她曾数次到区和县请求追回与杨彦儿离婚时分得的财产，也没有结果。直到去年司法改革时，她的问题才得到正确的处理。
    有不少政法机关和妇联组织，对婚姻问题采取推拖敷衍的态度，或者借口没有介绍信或条件不足等，多方为难，以致婚姻案件被大量积压起来，得不到处理，使争取婚姻自由的妇女因无法生活而绝望，自杀，或者被迫回到婆家而被杀。仅据广东省一九五二年六月份的调查，七十九个县共积压婚姻案件一万一千二百五十九件，其中妇女因婚姻问题或其他原因被虐杀的人命案就有二百三十五件，离婚案有九千三百多件。
    以上这些情况充分说明，婚姻法的执行虽然已经获得相当成绩，但是还根本没有全面地正确地贯彻下去。因此各级党、政机关和妇联等人民团体，仍应积极地为贯彻执行婚姻法而努力。
