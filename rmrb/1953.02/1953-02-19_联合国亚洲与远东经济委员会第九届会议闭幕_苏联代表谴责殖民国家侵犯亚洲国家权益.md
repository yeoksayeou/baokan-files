Xinhua News Agency, Bandung: The Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (formerly translated as "Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East") closed on the 14th. The last few meetings discussed the so-called "proposal" put forward by Cambodia regarding changing the rules of procedure and the authority of the commission, approved the report submitted by the commission to the Economic and Social Council, the work plan for the coming year, and the location and time of the commission's next session.

The meeting, in violation of existing rules of procedure, illegally included Cambodia's "proposal" on the meeting's agenda. This proposal stipulated that certain countries within the region under the commission's jurisdiction that had applied to join the United Nations as member states could be allowed to join the commission as members. This directly infringed upon the power granted by the United Nations Charter to the Security Council regarding the approval of new member states.

This "proposal" was attacked by the Indonesian representative, who emphasized that the commission must abide by the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the proposal under discussion attempted to overturn the United Nations Charter. He said that the Soviet Union consistently adopted a policy of safeguarding the interests of Asian countries and their legitimate rights, while the colonial countries were recklessly trampling on those countries' interests. The fact that China, the largest country in Asia, had been unable to have its legitimate seat on the commission for several years was precisely the result of American policy.

The colonial countries needed this proposal to change the authority of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, not, as they claimed for propaganda purposes, to strengthen relations between countries within its jurisdiction, but to undermine the principle of unanimity among the five major powers in the Security Council and attempt to overturn the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet representative voted against the proposal. The representatives of India and Burma abstained from voting because they were unwilling to support the proposal manipulated by the United States.

When the report to the Economic and Social Council was submitted to the commission meeting for approval, the Soviet representative made several amendments, which reflected the Soviet Union's position on the most important issues in the commission's report. However, these amendments were voted down by the colonial countries. Asian and Far Eastern countries abstained from voting.

The Ninth Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East adopted the recommendation of the Ceylon government to hold the Tenth Session of the Commission in Ceylon in February 1954.

    联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议闭幕
    苏联代表谴责殖民国家侵犯亚洲国家权益
    【新华社十八日讯】　据塔斯社万隆讯：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会（以前译“亚洲暨远东经济委员会”）第九届会议在十四日闭幕。最后几次会议讨论了高棉提出的关于改变程序规则及委员会权限问题的所谓“提案”，批准了委员会向经社理事会提出的报告、来年的工作计划以及委员会下届会议的地点和时间。
    会议违反现有的程序规则，竟把高棉的“提案”非法列入会议的议程。这个提案规定：对于在委员会权限范围以内的区域中、曾经申请加入联合国为会员国的若干国家，可以准许它们加入委员会为委员。这就直接侵犯了联合国宪章所规定的关于安全理事会批准新会员国的权力。
    这个“提案”受到印尼代表的抨击。他强调说：委员会必须遵守联合国宪章的条款。
    苏联代表指出：现在讨论的提案，企图推翻联合国宪章。他说：苏联一贯采取保卫亚洲国家的利益和它们的合法权利的政策，而殖民国家却在卤莽地蹂躏着那些国家的利益。亚洲最大的一个国家——中华人民共和国几年来一直不能在委员会中有它的合法的席位，这正是美国政策的结果。
    殖民国家需要这个提案来改变亚洲与远东经济委员会的权限，并不是如它们为了宣传目的而说的那样，是什么为了加强在它权限范围以内区域的各国间的关系；而是为了破坏安全理事会中五大国一致的原则，企图推翻联合国宪章。
    苏联代表投票反对这个提案。印度和缅甸的代表因为不愿支持美国所操纵的提案而弃权。
    当关于向经社理事会提出的报告提交委员会会议批准时，苏联代表作了若干修正，这些修正反映出苏联对委员会报告中最重要的问题所持的立场。然而这些修正被殖民国家投票否决。亚洲及远东国家在投票时弃权。
    亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议通过了锡兰政府所提出的一九五四年二月在锡兰举行委员会第十届会议的建议。
