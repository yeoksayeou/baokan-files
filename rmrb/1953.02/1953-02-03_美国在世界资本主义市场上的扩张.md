    U.S. Expansion in the World Capitalist Market
    By I. Filippov
    (Soviet Union)
    The disintegration of the unified, all-encompassing world market, as defined by J.V. Stalin, is the most important economic result of the Second World War, which has greatly reduced the scope for major capitalist countries to seize world resources. The world capitalist market has shrunk drastically.

    The policy of launching wars and expanding armaments pursued by the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is increasingly reducing the purchasing power of the masses in capitalist countries. This, in the final analysis, will lead to a further shrinking of the market capacity of capitalist countries. Under these circumstances, U.S. monopoly capital is trying to offset the growing difficulties in commodity sales by stepping up the expansion of foreign trade.

    In the years after the war, U.S. monopoly capital sharply intensified its offensive against the world capitalist market. According to materials published in the International Monetary Fund's monthly report "International Financial Statistics," in 1938, the United States accounted for 14.2 percent of the world's total export trade (excluding the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democracies); while in 1951, the U.S. share rose to 19.4 percent. The expansion of U.S. monopoly capital is achieved by squeezing out other countries, primarily its main competitor, Britain, from the world capitalist market.

    Britain's share of total world capitalist exports fell from 13.1 percent in 1938 to 9.4 percent in 1951. By the end of 1951, the value of U.S. exports was almost double that of British exports. In the Latin American market, and even within the British Empire itself, the United States is trying to squeeze out British exporters. In 1951, the total value of various commodities exported by the United States to the Sterling Area countries was 938 million U.S. dollars more than in 1950. In the markets of Western European countries, the position of U.S. capital has also expanded. U.S. export expansion is particularly severe in the Near East and Middle East, in Southeast Asia, and in British, French African countries, and other European colonies.

    The United States is trying to establish its own monopoly in trade everywhere in order to control prices. U.S. monopoly capital extracts food and raw materials from backward countries at prices far below world market prices. For example, Chile has lost no less than 250 million U.S. dollars in revenue from copper exports due to this American-style "trade."

    At the same time, the United States forces countries dependent on it to buy American goods at high prices. A bulletin from "Chase Bank" pointed out: "While the prices of major Latin American export commodities are falling, the prices of U.S. industrial products have risen by 16 percent compared with the first quarter of 1950. Now, in order to purchase the same amount of industrial products from the United States, Latin America needs to export a larger amount of goods. In other words, the terms of trade, the comparison between import prices and export prices, have become more unfavorable to Latin America."

    In addition, in order to seize new markets, U.S. capitalists have also widely adopted economic expansion methods such as dumping, that is, conducting export trade at auction prices. U.S. monopoly capital uses this method to bankrupt its competitors and remove them from the market. According to official statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in just the first eight and a half months of 1952, the total value of wheat, barley, corn, and other agricultural products exported by the United States at dumping prices reached 31 million U.S. dollars. Monopoly capitalists suffer no losses in dumping, because the difference between the normal price and the dumping price is made up by government subsidies borne by U.S. taxpayers.

    Under the pretext of "selfless aid" to backward countries and eliminating these countries' "dollar deficits," U.S. monopoly capital has been expanding its capital exports to these countries year after year. Although the total amount of U.S. private capital invested abroad has almost doubled in the past nine years, reaching nearly 14 billion U.S. dollars, U.S. financial groups and industrial groups are still not satisfied with exporting capital abroad at the current rate. Recently, U.S. government agencies, bank bosses, and manufacturers' associations have been conducting a particularly strong campaign to expand the export of U.S. private capital abroad. Participating in this campaign are the State Department, the Department of Commerce, and the Treasury Department, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, and the American Bankers Association.

    The organizers of these campaigns to strengthen capital exports abroad assert that U.S. capital exports can help eliminate the so-called "dollar deficits" in the trade and payment balances of Western European countries. They say that the U.S. dollars invested in colonial countries to exploit raw materials can be used by these countries to import goods from Britain and France. And Britain and France seem to be able to use these dollar inflows to pay for their purchase debts to the United States. However, even the American magazine "Business Week" has to admit that this statement is false. The magazine wrote: "If the United States supplies these backward countries with huge amounts of fixed capital, then U.S. exporters will inevitably supply most of the equipment necessary for the work..." The magazine asked: "Since this is the case, how can European countries sell enough goods to pay for the additional imports of raw materials and grain, and earn extra money to pay off the deficit to the United States?"

    In this way, capital export paves the way for U.S. commodity exports. In London, it has been recognized that the result of the United States strengthening capital exports to members of the British Empire will not be the elimination of the "dollar deficit," but the elimination of British influence in these countries. Not long ago, the London magazine "Economist" wrote: "The friendly cooperation of countries (referring to the British Empire) will not remain the friendly cooperation of British countries for long, if their economic development mainly depends on U.S. appropriations."

    U.S. monopoly capital uses various means to strengthen its export trade, while restricting foreign commodities from entering the U.S. domestic market. All industrial products and grains transported to the United States are subject to huge tariffs, the tax rate of which usually reaches 65-75 percent of the value of imported commodities, and sometimes even 90 percent. It also stipulates harsh import quotas, that is, import quotas, for many commodities. These prescribed quotas often actually amount to a complete prohibition of foreign commodities from entering the U.S. domestic market.

    The long-term chaos in the finances and foreign trade of Britain, France, Italy, and other Western European countries is a direct result of the ruling groups of these countries supporting the aggressive policies of U.S. monopoly capitalists, regardless of the national interests of their own countries. After shifting their national economies to expanding armaments and rejecting normal trade relations, Western European countries are facing long-term foreign trade and financial crises.

    Stalin, when talking about the contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries about a year ago, wrote: "On the surface, everything seems to be 'safe and sound'; the United States has made Western Europe, Japan, and other capitalist countries dependent on its rations; Germany (West Germany), Britain, France, Italy, and Japan have all fallen into the iron claws of the United States, obediently carrying out the will of the United States. But it would be wrong to think that this 'safe and sound' situation will be preserved 'forever,' to think that these countries will endlessly endure American rule and oppression, and to think that they will not try to break free from American shackles and embark on the path of independent development."

    Life has fully confirmed Comrade Stalin's prediction. The struggle between the United States and other capitalist countries for sales and investment markets is becoming more acute. The numerous trade barriers set up by the United States have aroused official protests from the governments of Britain, France, Italy, and many other countries. The ruling groups of Western European countries are strengthening trade wars against their big ally, the United States. In response to the new import barriers set up by the United States, the Western European competitors of the United States and other competitors are responding by implementing restrictions on the import of American goods. At the beginning of this year, the American goods imported by Britain and France were sharply reduced. The Netherlands also followed Britain and France in announcing a substantial reduction in U.S. wheat imports. Not long ago, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all announced that if the United States does not abolish the import quotas on dairy products from these countries, then they intend to implement restrictions on the import of American goods. Trade wars between capitalist countries are expanding, and their nature is becoming more and more cruel.

    The arms expansion stirred up in capitalist countries is, in the final analysis,
    is leading to the shrinking of foreign trade in the capitalist world. In 195
    In 2012, the turnover of commodities in the world capitalist market shrank quarter by quarter. After the short-term "boom" (the second half of 1950 and the period of 1951) caused by U.S. imperialism's military adventure in Korea and the expansion of armaments, U.S. foreign trade began to shrink. Materials from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that the annual average of non-strategic material exports has fallen from 16 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of last year to 11 billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter of last year. In particular, the sales of cotton, wheat, textiles, chemicals, automobiles, metals, and various equipment in foreign markets have fallen particularly sharply.

    It should be pointed out that although the United States seized a large share of commodity circulation between capitalist countries after World War II, U.S. monopoly capital has not been able to establish its dominance in the world market. The view that the United States can achieve this goal in the future is unfounded.

    Britain's struggle against the tyrannical power of the United States in international trade is becoming more and more acute. The British Empire Economic Conference, which closed in London not long ago, once again confirmed this situation. "The conference," the "New York Times" pointed out, "not only refused to make any weakening of existing trade and currency restrictions..., but instead adopted measures to expand trade discrimination for the benefit of the commodities of the British Empire member countries." It is very clear that the resolutions of the London Conference are foreshadowing a more brutal trade war between Britain and the United States.

    In the world capitalist market, the contradictions between the United States and West Germany, and between the United States and Japan, have also begun to become more intense.

    As is well known, the United States is encouraging West Germany and Japan to implement export expansion, hoping to use this as a tool to fight Britain in the world capitalist market. However, this policy has now begun to turn against the U.S. monopoly capitalists themselves. The American bourgeois newspapers are increasingly issuing warnings, pointing out that the growing competition from West Germany and Japan is beginning to threaten the position of the United States in foreign markets.

    It can be seen from this that the facts prove that the more fiercely the United States expands in the world capitalist market, the more profound the contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries become, and the more acute the struggle between them becomes.

    美国在世界资本主义市场上的扩张
    苏联  伊·费利波夫
    统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解，依据约·维·斯大林的定义，是第二次世界大战在经济方面的最重要的结果，它使得主要资本主义国家夺取世界资源的范围大大缩小。世界资本主义市场已经急剧地萎缩了。
    以美国为首的帝国主义阵营所推行的发动战争和扩张军备的政策，正在愈益降低各资本主义国家人民群众的购买力。而这归根结底将导致资本主义各国市场容量的进一步缩小。在这种情况下，美国垄断资本就力图用加紧扩张对外贸易的办法，来抵销增长着的商品销售困难。
    在战后的几年中，美国垄断资本急剧地加紧了对世界资本主义市场的进攻。根据国际货币基金委员会出版的月报“国际财政统计”的材料，一九三八年，美国在世界出口贸易总额中所占的份额是百分之十四·二（这里不包括苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家）；而在一九五一年，美国所占的份额却上升到百分之一九·四。美国垄断资本的扩张，是靠着从世界资本主义市场中排挤其他国家、首先是排挤它的主要竞争者英国而实现的。
    在世界资本主义出口总额中，英国所占的比重从一九三八年的百分之十三·一，降低到一九五一年的百分之九·四。到一九五一年底，美国的出口货物，按其价值来说差不多超过了英国出口货物的一倍。在拉丁美洲市场上，甚至于在不列颠帝国自己的境内，美国都竭力排挤着英国出口商。在一九五一年内，美国向英镑区域国家所输出的各种商品总值比一九五○年度多九亿三千八百万美元。在西欧各国市场上，美国资本的阵地也扩大了。在近东和中东，在东南亚，以及在英属、法属非洲国和其他欧洲各国的殖民地内，美国出口扩张进行得特别厉害。
    美国力图到处建立起它自己在贸易中的垄断，以便控制价格。美国垄断资本，用远远低于世界市场的价格榨取落后国家的粮食和原料。例如智利就因为这种美国式的“贸易”，在铜的出口上，丧失了不下二亿五千万美元的收入。
    同时，美国又迫使依附它的各个国家用高价购买美国商品。“大通银行”的一期通报中指出：“当拉丁美洲出口的主要货物的价格在下落时，美国工业品的价格却比一九五○年第一季度上涨了百分之十六。现在，为了要从美国购买同一数量的工业品就需要拉丁美洲出口更多数额的货物。换句话说，就是贸易条件、进口价格和出口价格的相互对比，都变得对拉丁美洲更为不利。”
    此外，美国资本家为夺取新的市场，还大量采用了像倾销这样的经济扩张手段，即以拍卖的价格来进行出口贸易。美国垄断资本利用这个方法，使得自己的竞争者破产，并从市场上把它们清除出去。按照美国农业部的官方统计数字，仅仅在一九五二年头八个半月中，美国用倾销价格输往国外的小麦、大麦、玉蜀黍和其他农产品，其总值即达三千
    一百万美元。在进行倾销中垄断资本家丝毫不会受损失，因为正常价格和倾销价格之间的差额，是由美国纳税者所负担的政府补贴金来弥补的。
    美国垄断资本在“无私的援助”落后国家和消除这些国家的“美元赤字”的藉口下，年复一年地向这些国家扩大着资本的输出。虽然，最近九年来，美国私人资本在国外的投资总额差不多增加了一倍，已将近一百四十亿美元，但是美国的财政集团和工业集团仍不满足于以现行的速度向国外输出资本。最近美国的政府机关和银行老板及制造商团体正在进行一个争取扩大美国私人资本向国外输出的特别强有力的运动。参加这个运动的有：国务院，商务部和财政部，全国制造商协会，美国商会，国际商会美国委员会和美国银行家协会。
    这些加强向国外输出资本运动的组织者们断言，美国的资本输出可以帮助消除西欧各国在贸易和支付差额上的所谓“美元赤字”。他们说，投入于殖民地国家开采原料的企业中的美国金元，可以由这些国家用于从英国和法国的进口商品上。而英国和法国则似乎可以用这些美元进款来支付它们对美国的购货欠款。但是，甚至“商业周刊”这个美国杂志都不得不供认这种说法是虚妄的。这个杂志写道：“如果美国供给这些落后国家以巨额固定资本，那么，美国出口商就必然会供应为进行工作所必须的设备的最大部分……”，这个杂志反问道：
    “既然如此，那么欧洲各国如何能卖出足够数量的商品，来支付增补的原料和粮食进口，并赚取多余的钱来偿付对美国的差额呢？”
    这样，资本输出就是为美国商品输出扫清道路。在伦敦，人们已经认识到美国向不列颠帝国各成员国加强资本输出的结果将不是消灭“美元赤字”，而是消灭英国在这些国家中的势力。不久以前，伦敦的杂志“经济学家”写道：“各国（即指不列颠帝国）的友谊合作不会长久地依旧是不列颠各国的友谊合作，假使它们的经济发展主要是依赖美国拨款的话。”
    美国垄断资本用各种手段加强自己的出口贸易，同时限制外国商品进入美国的国内市场。凡运入美国的工业品和粮食品都课以巨额关税，这种关税的税率通常达到进口商品价值的百分之六五——七
    五，有时甚至达到百分之九十。它对许多商品，又规定了苛刻的进口限额，即进口定额。这些规定的限额实际上常常是等于完全禁止国外商品进入美国国内市场。
    英国、法国、意大利以及其他西欧国家的财政和对外贸易中所存在的长期混乱，是这些国家的上层统治集团不顾其本国的民族利益，支持美国垄断资本家侵略政策的直接结果。西欧各国在把本国经济转入扩张军备和拒绝正常的贸易联系以后，已经面临对外贸易的和财政的长期危机。
    斯大林在大约一年以前谈及美国和其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾时，曾写道：“从外表上看来，一切都好像是‘平安无事’的；美国已使西欧、日本和其他资本主义国家仰其配给；德国（西德）、英国、法国、意大利、日本都陷入了美国的铁爪中，顺从地执行着美国的意旨。但是如果以为，这种 ‘平安无事’会‘永世地’保存下去，以为这些国家将无止境地忍受美国的统治和压迫，以为它们不会设法挣脱美国的镣铐，而走上独立发展的道路，那就错了。”
    生活完全证实了斯大林同志的预见。美国和其他资本主义国家争夺销售和投资市场的斗争正趋向尖锐化。美国所设立的许许多多的贸易壁垒，已引起了英国、法国、意大利和许多其他国家政府方面的官方抗议。西欧各国的统治集团正在加强贸易战来反对它们的大伙友美国。针对美国所设立的新进口壁垒，美国的西欧竞赛者和其他竞争者们正以实行限制美货进口做为回答。在本年度开始时，英国和法国所进口的美国商品曾急剧地缩减。荷兰也跟随着英法宣布大量削减美国小麦进口。不久以前，加拿大，澳大利亚和新西兰都宣布：如果美国不废除对它们这些国家牛奶制品的进口限额，那么它们就打算实行限制美货进口。资本主义各国间的贸易战争正在扩大着，并且其性质也愈来愈残酷了。
    在资本主义国家中所煽起的军备扩张，归根结底，
    正在导致资本主义世界对外贸易的萎缩。在一九五
    二年中，世界资本主义市场上的商品流通额是一个季度比一个季度地缩小着。在因美帝国主义在朝鲜的军事冒险和军备扩张的展开所引起的短期“景气”（一九五○年下半年和一九五一年时期中）之后，美国的对外贸易即开始萎缩。美国商务部的材料显示：非战略物资出口的年平均数已从去年第一季度的一百六十亿美元降到去年第三季度的一百一十亿美元。尤以棉花、小麦、纺织品、化学品、汽车、金属和各种装备在国外市场上的销路跌落得特别厉害。
    应当指出，美国在第二次世界大战以后虽然夺取了资本主义国家之间商品流通中的极大份额，但美国垄断资本却并没有能够在世界市场上建立起自己的统治权。认为美国在将来可以实现这个目的的看法，是毫无根据的。
    英国为反对美国在国际贸易中的横暴势力而进行的斗争，正愈益尖锐化。不久以前在伦敦闭幕的不列颠帝国经济会议再一次地证实了这种情况。“会议——‘纽约时报’指出，——不仅拒绝对现存的贸易的和货币的限制作任何削弱……，反而采取了扩大贸易歧视的措施以为不列颠帝国各成员国的商品谋利。”十分明显，伦敦会议的决议正在预告英美之间将进行更为残酷的贸易战争。
    在世界资本主义市场上，美国和西德、美国和日本之间的矛盾，也开始表现得更为剧烈。
    如所周知，美国正在鼓励西德和日本实行出口的扩张，指望以此来作为在世界资本主义市场上与英国斗争的工具。但是，这个政策现在已在开始转向反对美国垄断资本家本身了。美国的资产阶级报纸正日益发出警告，指出来自西德和日本的不断增长的竞争正在开始威胁美国在国外市场上的地位。
    由此可见，事实证明着：美国在世界资本主义市场上扩张得愈厉害，美国和其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾也愈益深刻化，它们之间的斗争也愈益尖锐化。
