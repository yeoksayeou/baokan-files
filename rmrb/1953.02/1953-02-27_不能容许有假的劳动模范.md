The fact that Minhou County, Fujian Province, falsely reported the yield of rice production models, as published in this newspaper today, and the fact that Lushan County, Henan Province, fabricated model agricultural production units, as published a few days ago, are extremely bad and must not be tolerated. The leading organs of Minhou County and Lushan County disregarded the prestige of our Party and the People's Government, violated the policy of rewarding model workers, distorted the truth, and committed illegal acts of deceiving the people, and must be duly punished.

Although such things are not very common throughout the country, they are by no means isolated cases. For example, the high-yield achievements of Xiang Changshun, a rice production model in Sichuan Province, Gao Youxian, a rice production model in Hunan Province, and Sun Shaoqing, a cotton production model in Hubei Province, who were awarded high-yield prizes by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1951, were all false. During the summer and autumn high-yield evaluation campaigns last year, some of the high-yield figures reported by many county and district leading organs were also untrue after in-depth investigations.

Why does this phenomenon occur? This is primarily inseparable from the championship mentality and departmentalism of the cadres directly leading production in these areas. They regard the serious political task of cultivating and rewarding model workers as an opportunity to show off their personal work achievements and curry favor with their superiors; they believe that the emergence of a famous model worker in their work area is their personal achievement and should be credited to them personally. However, they have not made real achievements or cultivated real model workers, so they do not hesitate to fabricate false high-yield achievements and fake model workers for their despicable personal purposes. Some peasants are unwilling to do this and do not want to be fake model workers, so they even resort to threats to force these peasants to agree to cheat. Supported by their championship mentality, they openly disregard the facts of scientific investigations by others and use the political trust of the higher-level leading organs to achieve their despicable goal of "turning falsehood into truth."

Some cadres, although they do not quite agree with this practice, say, "What's wrong with being wrong? Anyway, it's the honor of the whole district." "Who cares? As long as the model isn't snatched away by another township, it's an honor for our township whoever gets it." Some people think it's too "ugly" if there are no model workers in their locality; "Having a model worker, even if they don't have prestige locally, it's not a bad thing if they have prestige elsewhere." They do not understand that doing so is not an honor at all, but the greatest shame.

Model workers must be truly democratically elected by the masses and must have genuine high-yield achievements. However, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of cultivating model workers and usually do not pay attention to cultivating model workers at all. Only when the higher authorities want to evaluate and reward model workers do they temporarily go to the villages to investigate, or even appoint them by cadres without the evaluation of the masses. Even if they are evaluated, it is only a formality, as the masses say.

However, the reason why all fake model workers were not discovered in time but were instead rewarded is that the leading organs have serious bureaucratic work styles. Many higher-level leading organs only know how to issue orders and do not conduct work inspections; sometimes, even if they send people to the countryside for a trip, they only take a cursory glance and cannot go deep into the masses and cannot discover problems. They rarely inspect the work of cultivating model workers, and when evaluating model workers, they cannot help but blindly trust the false reports of lower levels. The fact that the Henan Provincial People's Government blindly believed in the so-called "absolute guarantee" of the Lushan County leading organs and rewarded the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative as a model high-yield unit, and the fact that the Minhou County leading organs, the Minhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Rural Work Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government evaluated Lin Qiumu as the national highest-yield model for double-cropping intercropping rice based on the false reports of lower levels, all prove the seriousness of the harm caused by this bureaucracy.

In recent years, we have made great achievements in implementing the policy of rewarding model workers and establishing advanced production banners. We have rewarded tens of thousands of model workers who have emerged on the agricultural production front. They have set a good example, played a leading role, and acted as the backbone in various aspects such as developing, consolidating, and improving the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, carrying out the patriotic high-yield movement, reforming agricultural production technology, breaking conservative ideas, and creating new high-yield records. They are the bridge between the Party and the government and the broad masses of peasants. However, due to the emergence of individual false high-yield achievements and fake model workers in the process of implementing the policy of rewarding model workers, this policy has been seriously damaged. It must be understood that the conservative idea of "reaching the top in production increase" is still prevalent among the peasant masses. They are already somewhat skeptical about the high-yield achievements of high-yield models. If the deeds of one high-yield model are inconsistent with the facts in the many high-yield models being evaluated, it will arouse the distrust of the peasant masses towards other high-yield models, and their conservative ideas will re-emerge, and the prestige of the Party and the People's Government will be seriously damaged, bringing many difficulties to future rural work. This is absolutely not allowed.

We believe that for the fake model workers that have already been discovered, the local leading organs, up to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, should take appropriate measures to announce the cancellation of their title of model worker and revoke the rewards given to them. For those model workers who meet the reward standards but have over-reported their yields, the local leading organs, up to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, should publicly correct their yield figures. The cadres who should be held responsible should be given criticism and punishment according to different circumstances, and they should be required to make serious public self-criticisms and earnestly correct their mistakes. Do not be afraid that exposing fake model workers will cause losses to the work; this idea is completely wrong. Only by exposing fake model workers can we make the people trust real model workers, and only then can we overcome the shortcomings in implementing the policy of rewarding model workers and earnestly carry out the work of cultivating model workers.

### 不能容许有假的劳动模范

    不能容许有假的劳动模范
    本报今天发表的福建省闽侯县虚报水稻丰产模范的产量的事实，以及日前发表的河南省鲁山县假造丰产模范单位的事实，是极端恶劣的，是决不能容许的。闽侯县和鲁山县领导机关不顾我们的党和人民政府的威信，违反奖励劳动模范的政策，歪曲事实真象，做出了欺骗人民的违法行为，必须受到应有的处分。
    这样的事情在全国说来虽然不是很普遍的，但也决不是个别的。例如去年受到中央人民政府农业部一九五一年度丰产奖的四川省的水稻丰产模范向长顺、湖南省的水稻丰产模范高佑贤、湖北省的棉花丰产模范孙少清的丰产成绩就都是假的。在去年夏季和秋季的丰产评比运动中，许多县区领导机关报告的丰产数字，经过深入调查后，有一些也是不真实的。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？这首先是和这些地区直接领导生产的干部的锦标主义、本位主义思想分不开的。他们把培养和奖励劳动模范这样一个严肃的政治任务，看成是表现个人工作成绩、向上级邀功的机会；他们认为在他们所在的工作地区出现了一个有名的劳动模范，那就是他们个人的功劳，应该记在他们个人的账上。但是他们并没有作出真正的成绩，培养出真正的劳动模范，于是，他们就不惜为了可耻的个人目的，不择手段地捏造假的丰产成绩和假的劳动模范。有的农民不愿意这样作，不愿意当假的劳动模范，他们甚至还采用威胁手段，强迫这些农民同意做假。他们在锦标主义思想支持之下，公然不管别人经过科学调查的事实，而利用上级领导机关对他们的政治信任，以达到他们可耻的“弄假成真”的目的。
    还有一些干部虽然不大同意这种作法，但是他们却说：“错就错吧，反正是全区的荣誉。”“管它呢，只要不要叫外乡把模范争去，本乡随便谁争去都是本乡的光荣。”有的人认为本地没有劳动模范太
    “不好看”；“有了一个劳动模范，虽然在本地没有威信，在外地有威信，也不算坏事。”他们不了解这样做丝毫不是光荣，反而是最大的羞耻。
    劳动模范必须真正由群众民主选举，必须有真正的丰产成绩。可是，有些干部对培养劳动模范的政治意义认识不足，平时根本不注意培养劳动模范，只是等到上级要评奖劳动模范时，才临时到乡下去调查，甚至于不经群众评选，而由干部指派。即便评选了，也不过像群众说的“走走形式”罢了。
    但是，所有假的劳动模范所以没有及时被发现反而得到奖励，原因还在于领导机关有严重的官僚主义作风。许多上级领导机关平时只知发号施令，不做工作检查；有时即使派人到农村跑一趟，也是走马观花，不能深入群众，不能发现问题。他们对培养劳动模范的工作既很少检查，到评选劳动模范时，就不能不盲目地信任下级的假报告。河南省人民政府盲目听信鲁山县领导机关的所谓“绝对保证”，就奖励文香兰农业生产合作社为模范丰产单位的事实，以及福建省闽侯县领导机关、中共闽侯地委、中共福建省委农村工作委员会和福建省人民政府农林厅、中央人民政府农业部根据下级的层层假报告而把林求姆评为全国双季间作水稻最高丰产模范的事实，都证明了这种官僚主义为害的严重。
    几年来，我们在执行奖励劳动模范政策、树立先进生产旗帜方面是有很大成绩的。我们奖励了在农业生产战线上涌现出来的成千成万的劳动模范。他们在发展、巩固和提高农村互助合作运动，开展爱国丰产运动，改革农业生产技术，打破保守思想，创造丰产新纪录等各个方面，给广大农民树立了很好的榜样，起了带头作用和骨干作用，他们是党和政府联系广大农民群众的桥梁。但是由于在执行奖励劳动模范政策的过程中，出现了个别假的丰产成绩和假的劳动模范，因而就使这一政策遭受了严重损害。必须了解，目前在农民群众中间“增产到顶”的保守思想仍然普遍存在。他们对待丰产模范的丰产成绩，本来就抱着某种程度的怀疑。在评奖的许多丰产模范中，如果有一个丰产模范的事迹不合事实，就会引起农民群众对其他丰产模范的不信任，他们的保守思想也就会因此而重新抬头，党和人民政府的威信就会因此而受到严重损害，给今后农村工作带来许多困难。这是绝对不能容许的。
    我们认为，对于已经发现的假劳动模范，当地领导机关，直到中央人民政府农业部，应当采取适当措施，宣布取消他们的劳动模范称号，撤销对他们的奖励。对于那些虽然合乎奖励标准但多报了产量的劳动模范，当地领导机关，直到中央人民政府农业部，应公开更正其产量数字。对于应负责的干部，应分别不同情况，给以批评和处分，并要他们严肃地公开地进行检讨，切实改正错误。不要害怕揭露了假劳动模范会使工作受到损失，这种想法是完全错误的。只有揭露了假劳动模范，才能使人民群众信任真的劳动模范，也才能使我们克服在执行奖励劳动模范政策中的缺点，使我们认真地去进行培养劳动模范的工作。
