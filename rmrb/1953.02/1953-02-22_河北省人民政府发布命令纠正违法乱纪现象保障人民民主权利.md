    【Our Newspaper News】The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued an order on February 18th, announcing the "Decision on Resolutely Correcting Illegal and Disciplinary Violations and Effectively Safeguarding the People's Democratic Rights" passed by the Provincial People's Government Committee. This decision stipulates:
    I. The people have the right to report and accuse any organ or cadre of illegal, undisciplined, and derelict conduct in any way (such as writing letters or oral statements) to any organ. No organ or cadre shall suppress, retaliate, or take the opportunity to retaliate against the people's reports and accusations; otherwise, they shall be punished for violating laws and disciplines.
    II. In order to facilitate the people's direct reporting, accusations, and requests for problem-solving, all self-imposed restrictions on the people, such as "introducing letters must be opened by the village and district to file a lawsuit" and "village and township cadres must open introduction letters when registering for marriage and divorce at the district government," are cancelled with the exception of those promulgated by the Central People's Government. All relevant departments, organs, and organizations shall not ask the masses for introduction letters when accepting people's reports, accusations, and requests; those who refuse to accept them because the masses do not have introduction letters shall be deemed as dereliction of duty.
    III. Resolutely correct the phenomenon of random arrests and detentions. Except for current criminals whom everyone has the right to immediately arrest and hand over to the government, and bad elements who have been examined and approved for control must be strictly controlled, only the judicial and public security organs of the people's governments above the county level have the right to arrest criminals and determine the control of bad elements in accordance with legal procedures. Any other organs or individuals have no right to arrest, detain, or determine control; violators shall be treated as infringing on human rights. In order to prevent organs or cadres from making mistakes due to unclear boundaries of principles, the scope of current criminals is announced as follows:
    1. Criminals who are committing crimes of destruction and violence such as murder, arson, poisoning, assassination, explosion, and directing the enemy to destroy targets (such as airplane bombing);
    2. Counter-revolutionary criminals who are engaged in various special agent and spy sabotage activities;
    3. Counter-revolutionary criminals who are engaging in or attempting to carry out riots, bandits who are armed with weapons and engaged in robbery, and bandits who are scattered and escaped during the suppression of bandits;
    4. Counter-revolutionary criminals who are wanted by people's governments and the People's Liberation Army at all levels;
    5. Escaped prisoners.
    IV. Effectively protect the people's right to appeal. If general criminals and relevant personnel believe that the public security and judicial organs have illegal measures in arrest and detention or that the custody and judgment are inappropriate, they have the right to file a complaint with the procuratorate at all levels or its direct superior, and it is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily shorten the appeal period to restrict the people's right to appeal. According to the practice of people's courts at all levels in judging civil and criminal cases: from the date the litigant receives the judgment, the appeal period is generally 20 days, and in special circumstances such as long distances, the elderly, the weak, and women, it should be extended as appropriate. If the litigant lists facts or provides conclusive evidence for others that the arrest or sentence is inappropriate or indeed wrong, the detention and trial organs must immediately correct the error. Conversely, those who deliberately shorten the appeal period, deprive the people of their right to accuse in disguise, or insist on errors shall be treated as infringing on human rights. If they know that the detention or sentence is inappropriate, but use the excuse of litigation procedures to push it to the higher level and delay the resolution of the problem, it shall be deemed as dereliction of duty.
    V. The people's procuratorate and supervision organs have the right to suggest that prisons or trial organs immediately release those who have been confirmed to be wrongly arrested, wrongly detained, or even wrongly judged after inspecting relevant cases of improper accusations, detentions, and trials, as well as illegal, undisciplined, and derelict conduct of cadres, and which belong to the people's internal problems, and then continue to clarify the situation and solve the problems. Typical cases with educational significance must be handled publicly to educate cadres and the masses.
    VI. In order to give full play to the power of the people's procuratorate and supervision, and resolutely crack down on illegal and undisciplined elements, it is necessary to enrich and improve the procuratorial and supervisory organs of governments at all levels. Administrative responsible cadres at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the above-mentioned departments, periodically inspect and supervise their work, and help them improve their policy level and ability to analyze problems. All cadres working in these departments should improve their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, carry forward the work style of being arduous, in-depth, meticulous, and accurate, and effectively and resolutely safeguard the people's democratic rights, maintain the seriousness of the government's laws, disciplines, and political disciplines, punish bad people, and eliminate bad things, so as to purify the political power organization and further strengthen the ties between the government and the people.
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued an order at the same time as issuing this decision: The people's governments at the district level and above should organize all cadres to conduct in-depth discussions on this decision in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and illegal and undisciplined behavior without exception. In the discussion, it is necessary to combine theory with practice, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and make a summary, which should be reported to the higher level step by step. The municipal, county (town) people's governments should immediately reprint this decision and distribute it to all streets and villages for universal posting; they should order the street and village cadres to read and explain it to all the people within a time limit, so that every household knows it and everyone knows it. Those who conceal this decision and do not announce and explain it to the people shall be punished for violating political discipline.

    河北省人民政府发布命令纠正违法乱纪现象保障人民民主权利
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府在二月十八日发布命令，公布了省人民政府委员会通过的“关于坚决纠正违法乱纪现象切实保障人民民主权利的决定”。这一决定规定：
    一、人民群众对任何机关干部的违法、乱纪和渎职行为，都有采取任何方式（如写信、口述），向任何机关提出检举和控诉的权利。任何机关的任何干部对人民群众的检举控诉，均不得压制、打击或藉端报复，否则以违犯法纪论处。
    二、为了便利人民直接检举、控诉和要求解决问题，除中央人民政府公布者外，一律取消各地自行规定的限制人民的“打官司必须村、区开介绍信”
    “结婚、离婚到区政府登记时由村乡干部开介绍信”等违法规定。各有关部门、机关和团体，在接受人民检举、控诉和请求时，均不得向群众要介绍信，如因群众无介绍信而拒绝受理者，则以渎职论。
    三、坚决纠正乱捕、乱押现象。除现行犯人人有及时拘捕送交政府的权利和经过审查批准管制的坏分子必须严加管制外，只有县以上人民政府司法、公安机关得依法定手续拘捕案犯和确定坏分子的管制，其他任何机关与个人均无逮捕、拘禁和确定管制权，违者以侵犯人权论处。为防止机关或干部因原则界限不明而犯错误，再将现行犯范围宣布于下：
    1、正在进行杀人、放火、投毒、暗害、爆炸、指示敌人破坏目标（如飞机轰炸）等破坏行凶罪犯；
    2、正在进行各种特务、间谍破坏活动的反革命罪犯；
    3、正在进行或图谋进行暴动的反革命罪犯及手持武器进行抢劫的匪徒和在剿匪中分散逃跑的匪犯；
    4、各级人民政府、人民解放军通缉在案的反革命罪犯；
    5、越狱潜逃犯。
    四、切实保障人民的上诉权。一般案犯与有关人员，如认为公安、司法机关在逮捕、拘禁中有违法措施或管押判决不当者，有向各级检察署或其直属上级提起控诉之权，并严格禁止任意缩短上诉期以限制人民上诉的犯罪行为。根据各级人民法院对民、刑案件判处的惯例：从诉讼人接到判决日起，上诉期一般为二十日，特殊情况如路远、老弱、妇女等，并须酌情延长。如诉讼人列举事实或为他人检举确证拘捕或判处不当或确属错误，拘押与审判机关必须立即纠正错误。反之，故意缩短上诉期，变相剥夺人民控诉权利或坚持错误者，以侵犯人权论处。如明知拘押或判处不当，而藉口诉讼程序推往上级，拖延问题的解决，则以渎职论。
    五、人民检察与监察机关，在检查有关控诉拘押、审判不当和干部违法、乱纪以及渎职等案件后，已确证为错捕、错押以至错判而又系人民内部问题者，有权建议监所或审判机关立即释放，然后再继续弄清情况，解决问题。对有教育意义的典型案件，必须公开处理，以教育干部和人民群众。
    六、为了充分发挥人民检察、监察的权力，坚决打击违法乱纪分子，必须充实与健全各级政府的检察和监察机构，各级行政负责干部，必须加强对上述部门的领导，按期检查督导他们的工作，帮助他们提高政策水平和分析问题的能力。凡在这些部门工作的干部，均应提高责任心和积极性，发扬艰苦深入、细致、准确的工作作风，切实地坚决维护人民民主权利，维护人民政府法纪、政纪的严肃性，惩治坏人，消灭坏事，以纯洁政权组织，进一步密切政府与人民群众的联系。
    河北省人民政府在发布此项决定同时，发布命令称：各地区级以上人民政府对此决定应毫无例外地组织所有干部结合反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪斗争，进行深入的讨论。讨论中必须联系实际，开展批评与自我批评，并作出总结，逐级上报。市、县（镇）人民政府应立即翻印此项决定，发到各街、各村普遍张贴；责令街、村干部限期向所有人民群众宣读解释，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。如隐匿此项决定，不向人民群众公布和解释，则以违犯政纪论处。
