    Refuting the Absurd "Intelligence Report" of the U.S. Aggressor Forces in Korea

    The U.S. aggressor forces command in Korea issued an extremely absurd and shameful so-called "intelligence report" on January 28th, using entirely fabricated "materials" to viciously slander and attack our negotiating representatives, and attempting to use this to absolve themselves of their bloody guilt of persecuting and massacring prisoners of war. This is clearly another despicable means by the American aggressors to completely sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The American aggressors' ambition to expand the war of aggression against Korea and use the issue of prisoner of war repatriation to completely break down the Korean armistice negotiations is becoming increasingly clear. To achieve this sinister goal, the American aggressors have used a series of unreasonable and barbaric means. The U.S. negotiating representatives unilaterally announced the suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations on October 8th of last year; then, the U.S. government blatantly rejected the Soviet Union's just proposal for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, and manipulated its voting machine to pass the Indian proposal, which made it easier for the United States to forcibly detain prisoners of war and expand the war of aggression. Following these actions, the American aggressors began to further push the armistice negotiations towards a final breakdown. They initially intensified the sabotage of the agreements on the conference area and the neutral zone, then resolutely and unilaterally tore up the agreement on the immunity of delegation supply vehicles from attack, and now they do not hesitate to fabricate this so-called "intelligence report" to blame their crimes of persecuting and massacring prisoners of war on our negotiating representatives.

    However, the "intelligence report" fabricated by the American aggressors is not only full of contradictions and unable to justify itself, but also exposes the American aggressors' shameless conspiracy. In this "intelligence report," the American aggressors stubbornly portray their crimes of massacring prisoners of war as "riots" that were "meticulously planned and directed" by our negotiating representatives, but how could our negotiating representatives, located in the Panmunjom neutral zone, "plan and direct" the "riots" of prisoners of war in the enemy's prisoner of war camps? The U.S. aggressor forces command's fifty-page "intelligence report" does not offer any facts to answer this question. On the contrary, they cannot help but admit in this fabricated "report": "The coordination of events may not be easy." Secondly, in this "intelligence report," the American aggressors also said that our captured personnel had established a "Liberation Fighting Association" organization in the U.S. Koje Island prisoner of war camp in May 1951, and that one of the goals of this organization was: "We must pay attention to the possible breakdown of the ongoing armistice negotiations, and at any time follow Kim Il-sung's orders to strive for our own liberation... attack the Republic of Korea and American troops now occupying Koje Island." Here, the American aggressors are obviously lying so deliriously that they have forgotten what they are doing. It is known that the Korean armistice negotiations only began in July 1951, so how could the organization of our captured personnel, established more than a month before the start of the negotiations, have "must pay attention to the ongoing armistice negotiations" as its "goal"? Isn't this a blatant lie! At the same time, the material refers to the Syngman Rhee puppet army as the "Republic of Korea" "army," which clearly proves that this fabricated material comes from the American aggressors themselves. This "intelligence report" also states that a person named "Gong Wenyi" had "incited riots in Camp No. 77 on May 27, 1951, and March 18, 1952, opposing voluntary repatriation screening." Here, in order to fabricate "intelligence," the American aggressors inadvertently exposed a fact, admitting that they had been illegally conducting forced "screening" of our captured personnel as early as May 1951, before the start of the armistice negotiations.

    After fabricating these many shameful "intelligence materials," the American aggressors wantonly attacked and slandered our negotiating representatives, and even shamelessly attributed their large-scale massacre of prisoners of war to our side, claiming that it was "to create propaganda material that might affect the Panmunjom armistice negotiations," and that it was a "new battlefield in total war" opened up by our side, directing unarmed captured personnel imprisoned in the enemy's "death camps," a "second front in the Korean War." However, the well-known fact is precisely that the American aggressors themselves have constantly disrupted the Korean armistice negotiations with their atrocities of forcibly detaining and massacring prisoners of war. In this "intelligence report" published by the U.S. aggressor forces command, haven't the American aggressors clearly admitted that in order to create an excuse for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, they illegally conducted forced "screening" of our captured personnel as early as May 1951? Moreover, later facts have also proven that when our side was making firm efforts to reach an agreement in the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors stubbornly created unreasonable demands for "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation" to obstruct the negotiations, causing them to be suspended and refusing to resume them to this day. As for using prisoner of war camps as "battlefields" and "second fronts," it is precisely the American aggressors themselves, not others. Proving this are none other than the former commander of the U.S. prisoner of war camps, General Colson, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. These sins of the American aggressors, which attempt to cover up the truth, have been unanimously condemned by peace-loving people around the world, and cannot be washed away under any circumstances.

    In this "intelligence report," the American aggressors shamelessly portray themselves as "respecting" the Geneva Conventions, while "the Communists do not respect this convention," and "the Communist prisoners of war in the Allied Forces prisoner of war camps and the Communist representatives in Panmunjom both demand these rights (referring to the rights of prisoners of war stipulated in the Geneva Conventions), but evade the obligations they should bear." The American aggressors are clearly attempting to distort the just struggle of our negotiating representatives to insist on the complete repatriation of prisoners of war and our captured personnel to fight for the right to return to their motherland with such ambiguous terms. This is extremely absurd. The struggle waged by our representatives and our captured personnel not only fully conforms to the spirit of the Geneva Conventions, but also is precisely to uphold the dignity and inviolability of the Geneva Conventions. Our captured personnel have waged a heroic and moving resolute struggle against the various atrocities of the American aggressors. This struggle is completely just and heroic. This is something that no fabrication or nonsense by the American aggressors can distort.

    Now the U.S. Eisenhower administration is actively preparing to expand the war of aggression against Korea. Under these circumstances, the release of this fabricated "intelligence report" by the U.S. aggressor forces command is clearly aimed at completely sabotaging the Korean negotiations and preparing to falsely accuse the Korean and Chinese sides at the upcoming resumed United Nations General Assembly. However, this despicable means of the American aggressors cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the people, but instead further exposes their ambition to expand the war of aggression against Korea. This cannot but arouse fierce opposition from peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world must become more vigilant and resolutely combat the American aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression. If the American aggressors disregard the resolute opposition of the people of the world and brazenly expand the war of aggression, then, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, the Chinese and Korean people will certainly inflict even more severe defeats upon them.

### 斥侵朝美军荒谬的“情报报告”

    斥侵朝美军荒谬的“情报报告”
    侵朝美军司令部在一月二十八日发表了一篇极端荒谬可耻的所谓“情报报告”，以全部出自捏造的“材料”，对我方谈判代表进行了恶毒的诽谤和攻击，并力图借此洗刷其迫害和屠杀战俘的血腥罪责。这显然是美国侵略者企图彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判的又一卑劣手段。
    美国侵略者企图扩大侵朝战争，并利用战俘遣返问题使朝鲜停战谈判彻底破裂的野心，是越来越明显了。为了达到这个罪恶的目的，美国侵略者使用了一系列的蛮横无理的手段。美国谈判代表于去年十月八日片面宣布了停止朝鲜停战谈判；接着，美国政府又在第七届联合国大会上，悍然拒绝了苏联的立即停战并和平解决朝鲜问题的公正建议，而操纵其表决机器，通过了便于美国强迫扣留战俘并扩大侵略战争的印度提案。在这些行动之后，美国侵略者便着手进一步来使停战谈判走向最后的破裂。他们始而加紧破坏关于会场区和中立区的协议，继而断然片面撕毁关于代表团供应车辆不受攻击的协议，现在更不惜捏造出这篇所谓“情报报告”，将它迫害和屠杀战俘的罪行归咎于我方谈判代表。
    但是，美国侵略者所捏造的这个“情报报告”非但矛盾百出，不能自圆其说，而且还暴露了美国侵略者的无耻阴谋。在这个“情报报告”中，美国侵略者硬把他们屠杀战俘的罪行说成是我方谈判代表“所缜密策划和指导的”“暴动”，但是身在板门店中立区的我方谈判代表，用什么方法去“策划和指导”在敌方战俘营里的战俘的“暴动”呢？对于这个问题，侵朝美军司令部的长达五十页的“情报报告”中举不出任何事实。相反的，他们在这个捏造的“报告”中也不能不承认：“事件的联系配合可能是不大容易的”。其次，在这个“情报报告”中，美国侵略者又说我方被俘人员于一九五一年五月就在美方巨济岛战俘营中成立了“解放战斗协会”组织，而这个组织的一部分目标竟然是：“我们必须注意正在进行的停战谈判可能破裂，并随时遵照金日成的命令争取我们自己的解放……袭击现在占领巨济岛的大韩民国和美国军队”。在这里，美国侵略者显然是说谎说得神志昏乱而忘其所以了。人们知道，朝鲜停战谈判是一九五一年七月才开始的，那末，在谈判开始一个多月以前成立的我方被俘人员的组织，怎么能够把“必须注意正在进行的停战谈判”作为自己的“目标”呢？这岂不是天大的鬼话吗！同时，材料中把李承晚伪军称为“大韩民国”“军队”，这更十分明显地证明这份捏造的材料是出于美国侵略者自己。这个“情报报告”还说有一个叫“龚文一”的人，在一九五一年五月二十七日及一九五二年三月十八日就曾在“第七十七号营场内煽动暴动，反对进行自愿遣返甄别”。这里，美国侵略者为了要编造“情报”，又不慎暴露了一个事实，不打自招地供认了他们对我方被俘人员非法进行的强迫“甄别”，早在停战谈判开始前的一九五一年五月间就在进行了。
    美国侵略者在捏造了这许多可耻的“情报材料”之后，竟肆意攻击和诽谤我方谈判代表，并且居然无耻到把他们大规模屠杀战俘的罪行，说成是我方为了“借以制造或许会影响板门店停战谈判的宣传材料”，是我方指挥被囚于敌方“死亡营”中的手无寸铁的被俘人员开辟的“总体战中的一个新战场”、“朝鲜战争的第二战线”。然而，人所共知的事实恰恰是：美国侵略者自己，正不断以强迫扣留和屠杀战俘的暴行，破坏了朝鲜停战谈判。就在侵朝美军司令部所公布的这个“情报报告”中，美国侵略者不是明明白白地供认了他们为了制造强迫扣留战俘的借口，早在一九五一年五月间就非法地对我方被俘人员进行强迫“甄别”吗？并且，后来的事实也证明了，美国侵略者在我方坚定努力要使朝鲜停战谈判取得协议之时，就蛮横地制造出“自愿遣返”和“不强迫遣返”的无理主张来阻挠谈判，并使谈判陷于中止，至今拒绝将其恢复。至于以战俘营作为“战场”和“第二战线”的也恰恰不是别人，正是美国侵略者自己。证明这一点的不是别人，正是美方的前俘虏营长官柯尔生将军和红十字国际委员会。美国侵略者的这些欲盖弥彰的罪行，已为全世界爱好和平人民所一致谴责，这是无论如何洗刷不掉的。
    美国侵略者在这个“情报报告”中，居然恬不知耻地把自己说成是“尊重”日内瓦公约的，而“共产党却不尊重这个公约”，“在联军战俘营的共方战俘以及在板门店的共方代表都要求给予这些权利（指日内瓦公约所规定的战俘的权利），而却规避应负的义务”。美国侵略者显然是企图以这种含糊的词句，来歪曲我方谈判代表为坚持战俘必须全部遣返和我方被俘人员为争取遣返祖国的权利而进行的正义斗争。这是十分荒谬的。我方代表和我方被俘人员所进行的这种斗争，不但完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神，而且这种斗争正是为了维护日内瓦公约的尊严和不可破坏性。我方被俘人员对美国侵略者的种种暴行，进行了可歌可泣的坚决斗争，这种斗争完全是正义的、英雄的行为。这是美国侵略者的任何捏造的胡说所无法歪曲的。
    现在美国的艾森豪威尔政府正在积极布置扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。在这种情况下，侵朝美军司令部发布了这个捏造的“情报报告”，其目的在于彻底破坏朝鲜谈判，并为在不久复会的联合国大会中对朝中方面进行诬告预作准备是完全显然的。但是，美国侵略者的这种卑劣手段不但不能遮掩人们的耳目，反而更加暴露了它决心扩大侵朝战争的野心。这不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的激烈反对。中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都必须更加紧张起来，坚决打击美国侵略者扩大侵略战争的阴谋。如果美国侵略者不顾世界人民的坚决反对而悍然扩大侵略战争，那末，中朝人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持之下，就一定会使它遭受更加惨重的失败。
