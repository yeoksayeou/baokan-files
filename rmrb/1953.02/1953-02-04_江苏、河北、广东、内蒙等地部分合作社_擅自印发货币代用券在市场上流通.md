Some Cooperatives in Jiangsu, Hebei, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia and Other Places Unauthorizedly Issue Monetary Vouchers for Circulation in the Market

	In the autumn of 1952, some cooperatives in Jiangsu, Hebei, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, and other places, when purchasing agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and peanuts, unauthorizedly printed and issued monetary vouchers for circulation in the market, which seriously undermined the state's policy of unified currency issuance, created market currency circulation confusion, and affected the credibility of the Renminbi.

	The face values of various monetary vouchers issued in various places include: 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, 1,000,000 yuan, and many others. The names include "Substitute People's Currency," "Circulation Notes," and "Fixed Amount Notes," among others. The number of issues is very large. Five supply and marketing cooperatives in Sanyu District, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, have issued more than 3 billion yuan since November of last year; Dazhongji Cooperative in Dafeng County issued more than 2 billion yuan in one week. Lintou Township Cooperative in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, issued more than 30 million yuan. Leting County Cooperative in Hebei Province issued 999.9 million yuan. Zhao County, Gaocheng, Pinggu County, Daxing, Jin County, Ningjin, Miyun, Zhangbei and other counties also printed them. Some cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region even issued blank slips of paper to act as currency.

	The methods of issuing monetary vouchers in various places are diverse. In November of last year, Leting County Cooperative in Hebei Province had already exceeded the controlled number of cotton purchases, so it printed and issued "Internal Fixed Amount Transfer Receipts" of 999.9 million yuan, distributed to six grassroots cooperatives including Chengxiang, Panggezhuang, and Hutuo, to purchase cotton and local specialties from farmers. The Leting County branch of the People's Bank of China discovered this phenomenon and immediately raised objections, but the county cooperative actually believed that this was a "trick" created in the increase production and practice economy movement. In November of last year, the Weisanzhuang Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Daxing County, Hebei Province, held a small-scale material exchange meeting in thirty villages. They mimeographed the notes, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce notified various businesses to also use them widely. When the Weisanzhuang Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative studied the issue of printing notes, the director of the Daxing County Cooperative and cadres from the special district cooperative were present, but they did not express any opposition. Lintou Township Cooperative in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, printed "Substitute People's Currency," and the Junjitun Cooperative in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region printed "Deposit Slips" to replace currency for payment. These cooperatives unauthorizedly issued monetary vouchers to purchase large quantities of cotton, grain, peanuts, etc. from farmers; some farmers also used them to pay public grain substitutes, causing market confusion and undermining the state's policy of unified currency issuance.

	After discovering the above problems, the Financial and Economic Committees and the People's Banks of Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces have promptly conducted inspections and corrections. However, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative has not yet reported the relevant handling situation to the higher authorities and should conduct inspections and handling quickly. (Yue Xi)

    江苏、河北、广东、内蒙等地部分合作社
    擅自印发货币代用券在市场上流通
    一九五二年秋天，江苏、河北、广东、内蒙等地部分合作社在收购粮食、棉花、花生等农产品时，擅自印发货币代用券在市场上流通，严重地破坏了国家货币统一发行的政策，造成市场货币流通的混乱现象，影响了人民币的信用。
    各地印发的各种货币代用券的面额有：一千元、五千元、一万元、二万元、五万元、五十万元、一百万元等多种。名称有“代人民券”、“流通票据”及“定额票据”等。发行数量很大。江苏省南通县三余区五个供销合作社自去年十一月份起印发三十余亿元；大丰县大中集合作社在一星期内即印发二十余亿元。广东省电白县林头乡合作社印发三千余万元。河北省乐亭县合作社印发九亿九千九百万元。赵县、藁城、平谷县、大兴、晋县、宁晋、密云、张北等县也印了。内蒙古自治区某些合作社且签发白纸条代替货币行使。
    各地印发货币代用券的方法是多种多样的。河北省乐亭县合作社去年十一月份收购的棉花已超过控制数字，即印发“内部定额转账收据”九亿九千九百万元，分配给城厢、庞各庄、胡坨等六个基层社，用来收购农民的棉花及土特产。中国人民银行乐亭县支行发现了这种现象，立即提出意见，但县合作社竟认为这是在增产节约运动中创造的“窍门”。河北省大兴县魏善庄联村供销合作社在去年十一月召开了三十个村的小型物资交流会，他们油印了票据，并由工商业联合会通知各商号也普遍使用。魏善庄联村供销合作社研究印发票据问题的时候，大兴县合作社主任和专区社干部都在场，但他们都未表示反对。广东省电白县林头乡合作社印制了“代人民券”，内蒙古自治区郡吉屯合作社印制了
    “存单”代替货币支付。这些合作社擅自印发货币代用券，向农民大量收购棉花、粮食、花生等；有些农民也以此缴纳公粮代金，以至使市场发生混乱现象，破坏了国家货币统一发行的政策。
    江苏及广东两省的财政经济委员会及人民银行发现上述问题后，已及时进行检查、纠正。但河北省合作社现在尚未向上级作有关处理情况的报告，应速进行检查处理。（月溪）
