Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has issued a circular on "Revising Measures for Principal and Interest Payment of the Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds," the text of which is as follows:

The Measures for Principal and Interest Payment of the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds were promulgated and implemented by this Ministry on January 29, 1951. Subsequently, due to the unification of currency in the Northeast and Xinjiang, the relevant measures for the issuance of bonds in Xinjiang and the redemption of these bonds in various regions were revised and promulgated on February 1, 1952. Now, in order to strengthen redemption work in various regions and to facilitate bondholders in receiving principal and interest, Article 9 of the original measures is revised as follows:

For bonds issued in Xinjiang Province, if they are brought to other provinces and cities, in order to facilitate redemption for bondholders, the local People's Banks are designated as transfer banks; and the People's Bank branches in Lanzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Shenyang are designated as paying banks. The redemption method will be based on the exchange rate in Xinjiang Province. Paying banks may pay immediately upon receipt of the bond, and transfer banks should issue receipts upon receiving the bonds and promptly send them to the paying banks. After the paying banks verify that there are no errors, they will remit the payable principal and interest to the transfer banks for the bondholders to collect the funds upon presentation of the receipt. For Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds issued by the Central Government that are brought to Xinjiang and Northeast regions, the People's Bank of Dihua City and the branches of the People's Bank in various provinces and cities in the Northeast are designated as paying banks, and payment will be made according to the exchange rate announced by the Head Office of the People's Bank. Local People's Banks within Xinjiang Province and local People's Banks within the Northeast provinces are designated as transfer banks, and the transfer method is the same as above.
