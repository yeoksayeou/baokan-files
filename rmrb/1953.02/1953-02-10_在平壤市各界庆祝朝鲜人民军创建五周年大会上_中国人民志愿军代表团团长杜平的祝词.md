At the Rally of All Circles in Pyongyang Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
Congratulatory Speech by Du Ping, Head of the Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers

Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Comrades Commanders and Fighters of the entire Korean People's Army:

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, I, on behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers and all Volunteer comrades, extend warm congratulations and high respect to the heroic Korean People's Army.

The Korean People's Army was founded single-handedly by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people. It has inherited the long-standing revolutionary traditions of the Korean nation, and it is armed with the ideology of patriotism and internationalism and the world's most advanced Stalinist military science and the army-building experience of the Soviet Red Army.

Although the Korean People's Army is a young force, its growth and the great achievements it has made are astonishing. To defend the freedom and independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, it has waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against enemies at home and abroad, contributed enormous strength, and displayed a lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism. In the struggle against the most ferocious enemy in the world, the Korean People's Army has become stronger and stronger in battle. Therefore, the Korean People's Army has won high honor among peace-loving people all over the world.

For more than two years, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have fought side by side, dealing a severe blow to the American aggressors, annihilating 740,000 enemy troops, and forcing the enemy into a dilemma; while the armies of the Korean and Chinese people have become even closer and stronger.

The American aggressors, unwilling to accept their defeat and disregarding the peace aspirations of the people of the world, are frantically preparing to expand the war of aggression. Today, we can assert that if the enemy dares to risk expanding the war of aggression, the battle-hardened Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will certainly be able to completely crush any military adventure of the enemy, inflict more severe blows on the enemy, and achieve even more brilliant and great victories.

Long live the Korean People's Army!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people and the Supreme Commander of the People's Army!

    在平壤市各界庆祝朝鲜人民军创建五周年大会上
    中国人民志愿军代表团团长杜平的祝词朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅暨朝鲜人民军全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    值此朝鲜人民军建军五周年之际，我谨代表中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员暨志愿军全体同志向英雄的朝鲜人民军致以热烈的祝贺与崇高的敬意。
    朝鲜人民军是朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅一手创建的。它继承了朝鲜民族悠久的革命传统，它是以爱国主义与国际主义的思想和世界上最先进的斯大林军事科学、苏联红军的建军经验武装起来的。
    朝鲜人民军虽是一支年青的部队，但是它的成长壮大和它建树的伟大功绩是惊人的。它为了保卫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的自由和独立，保卫远东和世界和平，向国内外敌人进行了英勇顽强的斗争，贡献了巨大的力量，发挥了崇高的爱国主义与国际主义精神。在和世界上最凶恶的敌人斗争中，朝鲜人民军是愈战愈强了。因此，朝鲜人民军在全世界爱好和平的人民中获得了崇高的荣誉。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，并肩作战两年多以来，给美国侵略者以严重的打击，已歼灭敌军七十四万人，迫使敌人进退两难；而朝中人民军队却是更加亲密无间、更加坚强了。
    美国侵略者，不甘心他的失败，不顾全世界人民的和平愿望，正疯狂地准备扩大侵略战争。今天，我们可以断言：如果敌人胆敢冒险扩大侵略战争，那么，久经战斗的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，一定能够彻底粉碎敌人的任何军事冒险，给敌人以更严重的打击，取得更加辉煌的伟大胜利。
    朝鲜人民军万岁！
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖、人民军的最高司令官金日成元帅万岁！
