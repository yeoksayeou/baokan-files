    True Prestige and False Prestige
    Ruqiaofu, Secretary of the Voronezh State Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    The 19th Party Congress attached great importance to leadership style and methods, the ideological qualities of communists, the conduct of leading cadres, and their relationship with the masses. Comrade Malenkov paid special attention to the issue of the prestige of leading cadres in his report. In the past and now, the Party has always attached importance to consolidating the prestige of the Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, and consolidating the prestige of their leading cadres. The true prestige (not false prestige) of a leading cadre is the inevitable result of his consistent and correct implementation of the Party's policies in his work.
    During the Soviet regime, our country has cultivated many leading cadres who have gained the respect of the masses and possess true prestige. Among the delegates from the Voronezh Oblast party organization who attended the 19th Party Congress was
    Konstantin Yakovlevich Petrov, the chief engineer of the "Telecom" factory. After the end of the Patriotic War, Petrov started working as an ordinary engineer at the "Telecom" factory. He is a talented person who constantly enriches his knowledge, is good at solving complex technical problems, and is able to treat his subordinates with calmness and care. He quickly gained the respect of the factory masses, and in a few years, Comrade Petrov rose to become the chief engineer of the factory and a Stalin Prize winner.
    It cannot be said that Petrov never makes mistakes. Of course, he also made mistakes. But he always quickly corrected his mistakes because he paid attention to criticism and accepted it actively rather than formally. For example, when some comrades expressed dissatisfaction at the party meeting that the technical committee held too few meetings, Petrov not only frequently convened technical committee meetings, but also invited directors of various workshops and work areas, engineers, and worker innovators to participate in the meetings. In this way, the technical committee became a real organ for exchanging technical opinions. This proactive attitude towards criticism shows that Comrade Petrov has become a very mature leading cadre.
    It must also be pointed out that Comrade Petrov has an important characteristic, which undoubtedly consolidated Comrade Petrov's prestige. He believes that all staff members are comrades in a common cause, and leaders cannot be indifferent to their fate and life.
    Comrade Petrov treats his subordinates with great respect and strict requirements. He not only regularly cares about the professional and cultural improvement of his assistants, but also cares about their "private lives." For example, when a serious conflict was brewing in the home of a certain technician, Comrade Petrov talked to the technician cordially, clarified the cause of the conflict, and worked until the family was reconciled. Naturally, this style of work and this attitude towards subordinates aroused people's respect for him and united all the staff into a collective capable of overcoming any difficulties.
    From these two examples alone, we can clearly see how Comrade Petrov is good at subordinating all his activities to the interests of the cause and the tasks of the Party. True prestige is forged in ordinary daily work. The Soviet people only trust and respect those leading cadres who demonstrate high ideological qualities not in words, in grandiose speeches, but in every action, in every "small matter."
    Our country gives leading cadres great powers and very favorable conditions in order to enable them to work more effectively. The vast majority of leading cadres clearly understand that the fact that the motherland grants them such possibilities and favorable conditions is a manifestation of the people's high trust in them, and this trust places a great responsibility on their shoulders. They should dedicate all their strength and all their knowledge to the cause they are undertaking in order to live up to this trust. However, some not very clever people here have not turned their brains around, they don't think that way; or perhaps, they haven't even thought about anything at all, but simply because they have great power in their hands, because they have a private secretary and a chief's office, they are a little "carried away." Some of these "chiefs" even have the illusion that there is no discipline that everyone must abide by. The common standards of communist morality are irrelevant to these "chiefs." There is no need to strive for prestige among the masses, because this prestige seems to have been obtained along with the briefcase and the chief's armchair.
    Kobyelensky, the director of the Khrinovo stud farm, is such a person. Obviously, he has forgotten that every leading cadre is a "servant of the people." He believes that he, Kobyelensky, is the supreme commander of all personnel and livestock. This poor leader decided that he could do anything, that the law was not made for him, but for "small people," for subordinates. Kobyelensky began to think that all his words were absolute truth, and the opinions of the masses were worthless, and even the opinions of all the staff were meaningless to him. However, a group of flatterers and "cronies" closely surrounded him, flattering this "wise director."
    Things developed to the point where Kobyelensky even began to refuse to complete the Party's tasks and demonstratively stopped attending meetings. He regarded the help and supervision of the Party organization as distrust of him and a violation of the principle of one-man leadership. He put "I" first. "I am the director," "I lead," "I am responsible." In a word, he only based himself on one principle: "I am in charge, I can do whatever I want."
    Obviously, taking the director's armchair as the sole pillar of one's prestige will inevitably lead to losing the respect and support of the masses, losing the last bit of prestige one has left, and finally, it is only natural to lose the director's armchair itself.
    Two leading cadres—two understandings of prestige. Here, those who possess true prestige (such as engineer Petrov) are primarily concerned with the cause, not trying to maintain their "chief's dignity." No one can guarantee that they will not make mistakes and faults. Lenin said: "A smart person is not someone who doesn't make mistakes. There is no one and there cannot be anyone who does not make mistakes. A smart person is someone who does not make major mistakes and who can quickly and easily correct such mistakes." The superiority of our Soviet society lies in the fact that each of us receives constant help and support from the people around us, enabling us to discover and correct mistakes in a timely manner, and this help is manifested in criticism.
    The prestige of any leading cadre depends on whether he can correctly grasp criticism. This is the touchstone for testing the maturity of each leading cadre. Correctly dealing with criticism will definitely greatly enhance the prestige of leading cadres. Comrade Malenkov said: "Staff members who cannot develop criticism and self-criticism are obstacles to our progress, they are not yet mature enough to be leaders, and they cannot expect the Party's trust." In particular, the attitude towards bottom-up criticism, the attitude towards criticism from ordinary staff, is of great significance.
    Bottom-up criticism is a manifestation of the Soviet people's concern for the welfare and prosperity of the motherland. This criticism is one of the basic forms of mass participation in leadership. However, unfortunately, there are still many face-saving leading cadres who simply cannot stand this kind of criticism. Some of them almost undisguisedly show their aversion to this criticism. This is called openly suppressing critics; for example, after Tavrichesk Machine Tractor Station Director Butko heard criticism of himself at a meeting, he immediately issued an order to severely administratively punish the critic. There are also some more clever people who plug their ears with cotton when subordinates criticize, but greet "chiefs'" criticism with false welcome.
    The hero of a famous satirical poem by Mayakovsky, the bureaucrat Popov, said: "Criticism from below is poison, criticism from above is medicine." In the Voronezh region, there is also a Popov—the director of the Voronezh Oblast Small River Administration, who said: "I can only listen to criticism from above." It seems that the difference between these two Popovs is not great. Unfortunately, this understanding of criticism is not limited to the "director of the Small River Administration" in Voronezh Oblast. Such situations are numerous, and when workers, technicians, and engineers constantly propose month after month, and even year after year, that in order to do a good job, the technical operation process of a certain workshop must be changed, the factory director becomes deaf. But when the ministry just raised criticism for this same technical operation process, he seemed to suddenly realize it. He nonchalantly summoned his subordinates, pretending to want to convince them of the necessity of those changes (which the workers had been constantly proposing to him for two years). People who listen to this chief will understand that what he cherishes is not the interests of the cause, but his own mediocrity and peace. They fairly believe that such leading cadres are sycophants and people who only seek to climb up, and such people will not be loved and cannot expect to gain prestige.
    Not long ago, the leading cadres of our Sugar Beet Trust made a new and huge "contribution" to suppressing criticism. There is no doubt that the priority for inventing new methods of investigating the responsibility for criticism belongs to them. This method is to so-called "extort" critics.
    When Comrade Mizigan wrote a letter to the trust, accusing the chief accountant of the Uryupinsk Beet Stockpile—a swindler who stole state assets—Trust Manager Malik had to send an inspector to the beet stockpile. The inspector's very superficial investigation did not confirm the facts mentioned in the letter, and Comrade Pirogov, the deputy manager of the Sugar Beet Trust, quickly issued an official document called "Sugar Beet Trust's Circular on Comrade Mizigan, the captain of the Uryupinsk Beet Stockpile Motorcade's Irresponsible Behavior."
    "I order: Comrade Mizigan shall be responsible for reimbursing the unnecessary expenses incurred by the trip to the Uryupinsk Beet Stockpile to investigate the irresponsible statement of the motorcade captain Comrade Mizigan."
    Of course, this kind of "reward" greatly dampened Comrade Mizigan's enthusiasm for exposing corruption for a long time, while the leading cadres of the trust were safe and sound. But corruption still existed, and when it was finally exposed, Comrade Malik ordered the dismissal of the beet stockpile manager. Comrade Malik wanted to use this order to shirk his responsibility for dealing with criticism in a formalistic and bureaucratic manner, and portray the matter as nothing, "everything is ready, the sinner has been punished." Only after the provincial party committee intervened did the leading cadres of the trust admit that they had "made a serious mistake."
    Suppressing criticism is a serious crime and must be punished. After committing this mistake, these people often begin to shirk responsibility, look for excuses, and blame objective reasons. In a word, they have no principles for themselves. This is the logic of suppressing critics. Three It is impossible to lead without prestige. Everyone understands this principle, even the worst leading cadres. Some people who cannot gain true prestige often resort to various tricks in an attempt to make up for this defect. They naively assume that prestige can be gained through certain special means and "magic." These "magicians" stubbornly believe that whether it is an idler, a bureaucrat, an arrogant or a suppressor of criticism, a person with low cultural level and questionable political qualities, can still establish prestige.
    For example, the director of the Voronezh Oblast Small River Administration mentioned above, he starts his work every day with two hours of "lecturing" to his subordinates. He shouts, threatens, roars, and scolds. He feels that the "secret" of prestige lies here. But others still do not respect him. Indeed, what is there to respect about him? The administration's work is a mess. He himself wrote in the report: "Due to the damage of all three passenger ships (one caught fire, and the other two need long-term repairs), the passenger route plan could not be completed." There is nothing to say, and nothing to be proud of. After the morning "lecture" is over, any subordinate can arbitrarily dispose of the director: when the director signs documents, because he does not understand the situation at all, he can only ask:
    "Is everything written correctly?"
    It should be said that individual party organizations mistakenly hope to support the prestige of leading cadres in business work no matter what, and sometimes even support the prestige of some swindlers, bureaucrats, and arrogant petty officials. Such party organizations did not think that in this case they could neither support the prestige of others nor discredit their own prestige.
    The personal prestige of any leading cadre is closely linked to the prestige of the Party and the Soviet state. Leading cadres who lose the trust and respect of the masses will also damage our common cause and damage the Party's prestige. This is a serious crime that no one can forgive. This is why we must adopt an intolerable attitude towards people with "false prestige," towards everything they do to suppress criticism, and towards every dishonest act they commit. We must know that these people are hindering our victorious advance and should be judged by public opinion. We must fight against them.

    真威信和假威信
    苏联共产党沃龙涅什州委会书记  茹阔夫
    第十九次党代表大会很重视领导作风和领导方法、共产党员的思想品质、领导干部的品行以及他们与群众的关系等问题。马林科夫同志在他的报告中，对于领导干部的威信问题特别予以很大注意。过去和现在党一直重视巩固党、苏维埃和经济组织的威信，巩固其领导干部的威信问题。一领导干部的真正威信（不是虚假的威信）乃是他在工作中始终不渝地、正确地执行党的政策的必然结果。
    在苏维埃政权时代，我们国家成长了不少获得群众尊敬和具有真正威信的领导干部。在出席第十九次党代表大会的沃龙涅什州党组织的代表中，有
    一位叫康斯坦丁·雅柯夫烈维奇·彼得洛夫的“电信”工厂总工程师。卫国战争结束以后，彼得洛夫开始在“电信”工厂当普通工程师。他是一个不断充实自己的知识，善于解决复杂的技术问题，能够以沉着和关心的态度对待下级的有天才的人。他很快就取得了工厂群众的尊敬，不几年光景，彼得洛夫同志升为工厂总工程师，成了斯大林奖金获得者。
    不能说彼得洛夫从来也不犯错误。错误，当然在他也是有的。但是他总是很快地改正自己的错误，因为他注意倾听批评，不是形式地而是主动地接受批评。例如，当有些同志在党的会议上对技术委员会开会太少这件事表示不满以后，彼得洛夫就不仅经常召集技术委员会会议，并且还邀请各车间和工区主任、工程师和工人革新者参加会议。这样，技术委员会成了真正的交换技术性意见的机关了。这种对待批评的主动性的态度，说明彼得洛夫同志已经成为一个很成熟的领导干部了。
    还必须指出彼得洛夫同志的一个重要特点，这个特点无疑巩固了彼得洛夫同志的威信。他认为任何工作人员都是共同事业的同志，领导者对他们的命运和生活不能漠不关心。
    彼得洛夫同志对待下级是高度尊重与要求很严的。他不仅经常关心他的助手们的业务和文化的提高，并且关心到他们的“私生活”，例如，当某技术员的家里正酝酿严重的冲突时，彼得洛夫同志就很亲切地和这个技术员谈了话，弄清了冲突的原因，一直做到使这个家庭重新和睦起来为止。自然，这种工作作风，这种对待下级的态度，引起了人们对他的尊敬，将全体工作人员团结成了一个能够克服任何困难的集体。
    仅从这两个例子中我们就可以很清楚地看到，彼得洛夫同志如何善于将自己的一切活动都服从于事业的利益和党的任务。真正的威信是在平凡的日常工作中间锻炼出来的。苏维埃人民只信任和尊敬那些不是在口头上、在冠冕堂皇的演说中，而是在自己每一个行动上，在每一件“小事”上都表现出高度思想品质的领导干部。
    我们国家给予领导干部以很大的职权，很有利的条件，是为了使他们能够更有成效地工作。绝大多数的领导干部都清楚懂得：祖国授予他们以这样的可能性和有利条件乃是人民对他们高度信任的表现，这种信任把重大的责任加在他们的肩上。应该将自己的全部力量，全部知识都贡献给所担负的事业，才不辜负这种信任。但是，在我们这里有些不很聪明的人却还没有转过脑筋来，他们就不是这样考虑的；而也许，他们根本连什么也没有考虑，而只是由于大权在手，由于有了私人女秘书和首长办公室，他们就有些“飘飘然”了，其中有些“首长”甚至产生一种错觉，似乎并没有一种全体人员都必须遵守的纪律。共产主义道德的共同标准和他们这些“首长”不相干。在群众中争取威信是没有必要的，因为这种威信好像已经同公文皮包以及首长的安乐椅一起得到了。
    赫林诺夫养马场场长柯别连司基就是这样一个人。显然他已忘记了，每一个领导干部都是“人民的勤务员”。他认为，他，柯别连司基，是所有人员和牲畜的至高无上的发号施令者。这个可怜的领导人决定了，他什么都可以做，法律不是为他制定的，而是为“小人物”，为下级制定的。柯别连司基开始认为自己的一切言论都是绝对真理，而群众的意见则一文不值，甚至全场工作人员的意见对他都是毫无意义的。可是，一群拍马屁者和“亲信”却紧紧地包围着他，奉承着这位“英明的场长”。
    事情发展到了这种地步，柯别连司基竟开始拒绝完成党的任务，示威式地停止参加会议了。对党组织的帮助和监督，他认为是对他的不信任，是违反一长负责制原则。他把“我”放到了第一位。“我是场长”，“我领导”，“我负责。”一句话，他只依据一个原则：“我是负责人，我愿干什么就干什么。”
    显然，把场长的安乐椅当作自己的威信的唯一支柱，是不可避免地要失掉群众的尊敬和支持，失掉自己最后剩下的一点威信的，而最后，很自然地，就该失掉场长的安乐椅本身了。
    两个领导干部——两种对威信的了解。在这里，拥有真威信的人（如彼得洛夫工程师），是首先关心事业，而不是设法维持自己的“首长的尊严”。二谁也不能保证不犯错误和过失。列宁说：“聪明人并不是不犯错误的人。不犯错误的人是没有而且也不能有的。聪明人是不犯重大错误，同时又是能迅速而容易地纠正这种错误的人。”我们苏维埃社会的优越性就在于：我们每个人都受到周围人们的经常帮助与支持，使我们能够及时发现与改正错误，这种帮助就表现在批评中。
    任何领导干部的威信都取决于是否能正确掌握批评。这是考验每个领导干部成熟与否的试金石。正确对待批评是一定会大大提高领导干部的威信的。马林科夫同志说：“不能展开批评和自我批评的工作人员是我们前进的障碍，他们还没有成熟得能做领导者，他们不能指望党的信任。”特别是对待自下而上的批评的态度，对待来自一般工作人员的批评态度，尤其具有重大的意义。
    自下而上的批评是苏联人民关心祖国福利与繁荣的表现。这种批评是群众参加领导的基本形式之
    一。但是，可惜的很，还有不少讲面子的领导干部偏偏受不了这种批评。其中有些人几乎毫不隐瞒自己对这种批评的反感。这就叫做公开的压制批评者；如塔伏尔日斯克机器拖拉机站站长布特柯，当他在会议上听到了对自己的批评以后，他就立刻发出命令，对批评者给以严厉的行政处分。另外也有一些更机灵的人，下级批评时，他们只用棉花堵住耳朵，而当“首长”批评时，他们则报以虚伪的欢迎。
    马雅可夫斯基的一首著名讽刺诗中的英雄——官僚主义者波波夫说道：“下边来的批评是毒药，上边来的批评是良药。”在沃龙涅什州，也有一个波波夫——沃龙涅什州小河管理局局长，他说：“我只能听取上级的批评。”看来，这两位波波夫之间的区别是不大的。不幸的是，这样了解批评的不仅是沃龙涅什州的“小河管理局局长”一个人。这样的情形是很多的，当工人、技术员、工程师月复一月，甚至年复一年地不断提出，说为了做好工作，必须改变某某车间的技术作业过程的时候，厂长就变成了聋子。而当部里为了这同样的技术作业过程刚提出批评的时候，他好像突然恍然大悟了。他若无其事地召集下级，装模作样地想使他们相信那些变更的必要性了（而这正是工人两年来不断向他提出的）。人们听着这位首长就会明白，他所宝贵的不是事业利益，而是本身的庸俗苟安。他们公平地认为这样的领导干部是拍马屁的，是只图向上爬的人，而这种人是不会受到爱戴的，他们不能指望获得威信。
    不久以前，我们糖萝卜托辣斯的领导干部们在压制批评上作出新的巨大“贡献”。毫无疑问，发明追究批评责任的新方法的优先权属于他们。这个方法是对批评者进行所谓“敲竹杠”。
    当米齐根同志写信给托辣斯，检举乌留平斯克萝卜堆栈的总会计——一个盗窃国家资财的骗子的时候，托辣斯经理马利克不得不派一个检查员到这个萝卜堆栈去。检查员所进行的很表面的调查并未证实信中所提的事实，糖萝卜托辣斯副经理皮罗果夫同志就赶快发出了一个公文，叫做“糖萝卜托辣斯关于乌留平斯克萝卜堆栈汽车队队长米齐根同志不负责任的行为的通令”。
    “我命令：为了检查由于汽车队队长米齐根同志的不负责任的声明而出差到乌留平斯克萝卜堆栈所造成的无谓支出，应由米齐根同志负责偿还。”
    当然，这种“奖励”办法长久地把米齐根同志揭发贪污罪行的热情打下去，而托辣斯的领导干部们则平安无事了。但是贪污行为仍然存在，而当最后被揭发以后，马利克同志下令撤销萝卜堆栈经理的工作。马利克同志想用这个命令来推卸他以形式主义和官僚主义态度对待批评的责任，把事情描绘成没有什么，“一切就绪，罪人已惩办”。只是在省委过问后，托辣斯的领导干部们才承认“犯了严重错误”。
    压制批评是严重的罪行，要予以惩治。这种人往往在犯了这个错误以后，就开始推脱责任，寻找借口，把过错推在客观原因上。一句话，他们对自己是毫无原则的。这就是压制批评者的逻辑。三没有威信是不可能进行领导的。这个道理谁都懂得，甚至最糟的领导干部都懂得。某些不能获得真正威信的人，往往玩弄各种手腕，企图弥补他这个缺陷。他们天真地设想，威信可以借助某些特别的手段和“魔术”来获得。这些“魔术家”固执地相信：不管是游手好闲者、官僚主义者、自高自大或压制批评者、文化水平低和政治品质成问题的人，都一样可以树立威信。
    比如说吧，上面已经讲过的沃龙涅什州小河管理局局长，他每天都要以两小时对下级的“训话”来开始自己的工作。他叫喊、恫吓、咆哮、斥责。他觉得威信的“秘密”就在这里。但别人还是不尊敬他。的确，他有什么可值得尊敬的呢？管理局的业务一团糟。他自己在报告中写道：“由于所有的三艘客船均已损坏（一艘失火，其余两艘需长期修理），客运航程计划未能完成。”没有什么可说的，更没有什么值得骄傲的。在早晨的“训话”结束以后，任何下级就可任意支配局长了：局长在签署文件时，由于他根本不掌握情况，所以只能问一句：
    “写的都对吗？”
    应该说，个别党组织错误地希望无论如何都要支持业务工作领导干部的威信，有时还支持一些骗子、官僚主义者和狂妄自大的小官吏的威信。这样的党组织没有想到他们在这种情况下既不能支持别人的威信，又会使自己的威信扫地的。
    任何一个领导干部的个人威信是和党及苏维埃国家的威信紧密联系着的。丧失了群众的信任和尊敬的领导干部，也会损害我们的共同事业，损害党的威信，这是任何人也不能饶恕的严重罪行。这就是为什么我们要对“假威信”的人，对他们压制批评的每件事情，对他们每一件不诚实的行为都要采取不能容忍的态度的原因。要知道，这些人阻碍着我们的胜利前进，应该让他们受到社会舆论的审判，必须向他们进行斗争。
