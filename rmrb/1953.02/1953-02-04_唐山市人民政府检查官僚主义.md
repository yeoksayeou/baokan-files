    Tangshan Municipal People's Government Inspects Bureaucracy

    Editor Comrades: After reading Comrade Li Changqi's letter "Tangshan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau and Other Departments Should Thoroughly Investigate Bureaucracy" published in the People's Daily on November 13, 1952, we immediately formed an inspection team with relevant departments and conducted a serious inspection. The results of the handling are reported as follows:

    I. Regarding the issue of beef and mutton for the National Day raised by representatives of the Hui people last year, Ren Fumin, the head of the Commercial Section of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, had already convened a meeting of the city's beef and mutton industry on September 13th last year to discuss it. By September 17th, the beef and mutton industry and the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau had not yet reached a consensus on the content of the "purchase certificate." When Comrade Li Changqi visited Hui representative Ding Cunyou, Ding reflected this situation to Li. On September 21st, all issues regarding beef and mutton were resolved. On September 23rd, the Commercial Section of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau received the issue reflected by Ding Cunyou forwarded by the Municipal Consultative Committee. Ren Fumin, the head of the section, instructed staff member Liu Huanzhang to reply that the issue had been resolved, but Liu did not reply until October 6th. The original reply letter did not contain the words "outdated," but rather the reply time had passed the National Day, so Comrade Li Changqi reflected that this reply was "outdated."

    II. Regarding the suggestion from representative Zhao Yuzhen of Xixin Village (West Xinzhuang Village) to establish a water pump in the village. On August 16th last year, after receiving this suggestion, the Municipal Construction Bureau immediately forwarded it to the Water Company for research and handling by Comrade Jia Youzhi (formerly mistakenly written as Jia Youzhi) of the Management Section of the bureau. On August 25th, the Water Company replied to the Municipal Construction Bureau saying: "...there are no funds in 1952, and it is planned to install it in 1953." The next day, the Secretariat of the Municipal Construction Bureau wrote a letter to inform the original proposal representative Zhao Yuzhen of this situation, but did not simultaneously inform the Municipal Consultative Committee. Comrade Li Changqi asked representative Zhao Yuzhen whether she had received a reply, and Zhao said: "No." (Zhao did not ask in detail which unit's reply it was, and Zhao had also reported this matter to the First District People's Government of our city, without receiving a reply.) Therefore, the Municipal Consultative Committee urged the Management Section of the Municipal Construction Bureau. Comrades Jia Youzhi and Lu Zian of the section did not know whether this matter had been replied to, nor did they further investigate. They only evaded the inquiries from the Municipal Consultative Committee, treating matters that had been handled as if they had not been handled, resulting in the comrades of the Municipal Consultative Committee making four face-to-face urgings and more than ten telephone urgings without clarifying the issue.

    In addition, issues such as the impure grain seeds loaned by the People's Government last spring causing reduced production for farmers, the disinfection of well water in Guogezhuang Kiln Village, the incompetence of teachers in the Ninth District People's School, the handling of some fruits of victory in the land reform reflected by military属 representative Zhang Dezhi, the issues raised by Liu Zhisheng, the principal of the private Peiren Middle School, the Blackwater Ditch in the Kailuan Coal Mine area, and the bad style of teacher Ding Shuhua in the First District have all been inspected separately. Relevant derelict cadres have also made self-criticisms.

    From these events, we can see the following shortcomings in our organs: 1. Indifference to the masses, resulting in the casual backlog and loss of mass proposals and other documents. Some have been repeatedly urged by the secretariat department, but they still take a dismissive attitude. This seriously damages the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. This kind of bureaucratic work style is intolerable. 2. Some units and cadres always think that "the affairs of the masses are ultimately minor" and "official business is ultimately more important," thus delaying the handling of issues reflected by the masses. 3. Some units and cadres do not attach importance to consultative organs, so some matters have been handled but the Consultative Committee has not been promptly informed. 4. In some units, the internal organization and division of labor are not clear, there is no contact with each other, the system is not sound enough, the work situation is not understood by each other, and there is no inspection. Therefore, things that have been done are not known, and manpower is wasted.

    We have already discussed the above situation with Comrade Li Changqi in person, and hope that he will continue to give us more opinions in the future to help us do our work well.  Tangshan Municipal People's Government

### 唐山市人民政府检查官僚主义

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山市人民政府检查官僚主义
    编辑同志：读了一九五二年十一月十三日人民日报刊载的李长岐同志写的“唐山市人民政府建设局等部门应彻底检查官僚主义”一信后，我们立即会同有关部门组成检查组，认真地作了检查。今把处理结果报告如下：
    一、关于回民代表在去年提出的国庆节的牛羊肉食问题，早在去年九月十三日就由市工商局商业科科长任福民召开全市牛羊肉业开会讨论过，到九月十七日，牛羊肉业方面和市工商局方面对“采购证”的内容，还没有取得一致意见。当李长岐同志访问回民代表丁存有时，丁向李反映了这一情况。九月二十一日，关于牛羊肉食的所有问题都解决了。九月二十三日，市工商局商业科接到市协商委员会转来丁存有反映的问题，该科科长任福民嘱科员刘焕章答复问题已经解决，但一直拖到十月六日刘才答复。原答复信没有“已失时效”字句，而是答复的时间已经过了国庆节，所以李长岐同志反映这个答复“已失时效”了。
    二、关于西新村（西辛庄村）赵玉珍代表群众建议在该村建立水泵问题。去年八月十六日，市建设局接到该项建议后，当天即由该局管理科贾友之（前误为贾友芝）同志转给自来水公司研究处理。八月二十五日，自来水公司答复市建设局说：“……一九五二年没有经费，计划在一九五三年再行安装。”第二天就由市建设局秘书室把这情况写信告诉原提案代表赵玉珍，但没有同时告知市协商委员会。李长岐同志问代表赵玉珍是否得到了答复，赵说：“没给。”（赵未详细问是那一单位的答复，而赵也曾经把这事向我市第一区人民政府反映过，没有得到答复。）所以市协商委员会就催问市建设局管理科。该科贾友之、鲁子安等同志不知这事是否答复过，也没有进一步追查，只对市协商委员会的催问支吾搪塞，把办过的事情当成没有办，以致市协商委员会的同志面催四次，电话催十次之多，都没有把这问题弄清。
    另外，关于去春人民政府贷谷种不纯使农民减产的问题，关于国各庄窑上村井水消毒问题，关于第九区民校教员不称职问题，关于军属代表张德志反映的土地改革中部分胜利果实的处理问题，关于私立培仁中学校长刘秩生提出的问题，关于开滦煤矿区黑水沟问题，关于第一区教员丁淑华作风不好的问题等，都已分别作了检查。有关失职干部也已经作了检讨。
    从这些事件中，可以看出我们机关中存在着以下缺点：一、对群众漠不关心，以致随便积压、丢失群众提案等文件。有的经秘书部门几次催办，也采取置之不理的态度。这严重地损害了党和人民政府的威信。这种官僚主义作风是不可容忍的。二、有的单位和干部，总以为“群众的事究竟轻微一些”，“公事究竟重要一些”，因此拖延处理群众反映的问题。三、有的单位和干部不重视协商机关，因而有些事已经办了也没有及时答复协商委员会。四、有的单位，内部组织分工不明确，互不联系，制度也不够健全，工作情况互不了解，也不检查，因此，已办了的事情也不知道，并且浪费了人力。
    以上情况，我们已经当面和李长岐同志谈过，并希望他今后继续多多对我们提意见，帮助我们把工作做好。   唐山市人民政府
