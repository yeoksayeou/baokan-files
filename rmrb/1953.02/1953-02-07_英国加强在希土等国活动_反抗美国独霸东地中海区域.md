Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: The United States' attempt to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean region has provoked increasingly fierce resistance from Britain. The recent friction in Greece between the Mediterranean Naval Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), British Admiral Mountbatten, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern European Command of NATO, US Admiral Carney, is a clear example.

The open and covert struggle between the United States and Britain for the Eastern Mediterranean region has a long history. After the war, the United States gradually controlled Greece, Turkey, and other countries to a considerable extent. However, the United States is not satisfied with this and is trying every means to completely drive Britain out of its traditional sphere of influence. After forcing Britain to agree to drag Greece and Turkey into NATO, the United States established the Southeast European Land Forces Command of NATO in 1952, placing the armies of Turkey and Greece under the command of US generals, thereby dealing a major blow to British interests. US Secretary of the Army Pace and Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO Ridgeway, have visited Greece and Turkey to plan the formation of a military alliance between Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. At the same time, Britain is also intensifying its activities in the region to counter US aggression. After British Foreign Secretary Eden visited Yugoslavia and invited the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to visit London, Eden also announced that he would visit Greece and Turkey this spring.

This time, Mountbatten suddenly appeared in Athens on January 27th, without prior knowledge of the US side. According to Mountbatten, he was en route to Turkey when he had to land in Athens because of "bad weather". Thus, this "Briton, although not invited," participated in the military meeting that Carney was holding with Greek government officials. On the 28th, Mountbatten announced that his trip was to establish a new headquarters for the "Allied forces" and that he had reached a "complete agreement on defense issues" with the Greek defense leaders. Mountbatten's sudden appearance in Greece caused great dissatisfaction among the Americans. The Athens newspaper "Akropolis" revealed that the Americans had made an "urgent check" on the weather report for the flight to Turkey, proving that the climate conditions "were not so bad as to require Mountbatten to land in Greece." The Athens newspapers all published this news prominently. The "Freedom" newspaper headlined the story: "Friction between Britain and the United States in the Mediterranean; The Carney-Mountbatten Affair."

Obviously, Mountbatten's move was by no means accidental. "Freedom" said: Mountbatten "is often used by the British government to carry out diplomatic work. It is very significant that he advanced his visit to Greece in order to coincide with Carney's... visit." According to the agreement between the United States and Britain at the NATO Council meeting last December, the navies of Greece and Turkey were originally under Mountbatten's command. However, the United States is stepping up its control of the navies of Greece and Turkey, attempting to have Carney replace Mountbatten. This US offensive in the Eastern Mediterranean region cannot but arouse fierce resistance from the British side. It is reported that while Mountbatten is visiting Greece and Turkey, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Land Forces, Robertson, will also be active in Turkey.

### 英国加强在希土等国活动  反抗美国独霸东地中海区域

    英国加强在希土等国活动
    反抗美国独霸东地中海区域 【新华社五日讯】美国企图独霸东地中海区域的活动，已引起英国越来越激烈的反抗。最近，北大西洋集团地中海海军司令、英国海军将领蒙巴顿和北大西洋集团南欧区司令部总司令、美国海军将领卡涅在希腊演出的摩擦，就是一个明显的例子。
    美英两国争夺东地中海区域的明争暗斗由来已久。美国在战后已逐步在相当大的程度上控制了希腊和土耳其等国家。但美国并不以此为满足，正在千方百计地企图把英国完全逐出它的这一传统势力范围。美国在迫使英国同意把希腊与土耳其拖入北大西洋集团以后，又在一九五二年成立了北大西洋集团东南欧陆军司令部，把土希两国的军队划归美国将领指挥，从而给予英国的利益以重大打击。美国陆军部长佩斯和北大西洋集团军队总司令李奇微等都曾亲往希土活动，策划组织希腊、土耳其和南斯拉夫的三国军事同盟。同时，英国也在这一地区加紧活动以对抗美国的进攻。在英国外相艾登访问南斯拉夫，并邀请土耳其总理和外交部长访问伦敦以后，艾登又已宣布将于今春访问希腊和土耳其。
    这次，蒙巴顿于一月二十七日突然在雅典出现，事先美国方面并不知道。据蒙巴顿说，他是在赴土耳其途中因为“天气太坏”，而不得不在雅典降落的。这样，这个“英国人虽然没有被邀请”，却参加了卡涅正在与希腊政府官员举行的军事会议。蒙巴顿并在二十八日宣布他此行是为了建立“盟军”的新司令部，且已与希腊国防领袖“就防御问题达成完全协议”。蒙巴顿在希腊的突然出现，引起了美国人很大的不满。雅典的“阿克罗波利斯报”透露，美国人曾就飞往土耳其的天气报告作了“紧急检查”，证明气候情况“并不是坏得必须使蒙巴顿在希腊降落”。雅典各报均大事刊登这个消息，“自由报”登载这件事的标题是：“英美在地中海的摩擦；卡涅与蒙巴顿的事件”。
    显然，蒙巴顿这个举动绝对不是偶然的。“自由报”说：蒙巴顿“常被英国政府用来进行外交工作。他提早了对希腊的访问，以便与卡涅……的访问同时举行，这是很有意义的”。根据美英两国在去年十二月北大西洋公约理事会会议上的协议，希腊和土耳其的海军原是划归蒙巴顿指挥的。但美国却加紧控制希土两国的海军，企图使卡涅取蒙巴顿而代之。美国在东地中海区域的这种进攻，不能不引起了英国方面的激烈反抗。据悉：在蒙巴顿访问希土的同时，英国中东陆军总司令罗伯逊也将到土耳其活动。
