Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 7th: Our special correspondent reports that on the afternoon of February 4th, the same day the U.S. liaison officer admitted to shelling the Panmunjom conference area, American planes once again hostilely flew over the conference area in broad daylight to bomb nearby positions. As American planes flew over the conference tents, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhu Ran, reiterated a warning to the U.S. liaison officer at the liaison officers' meeting: No fabricated excuse can help him escape the responsibility for violating the agreement; these destructive actions are making the conference area impossible to exist.
　　The U.S. liaison officer once again refused to acknowledge responsibility for the U.S. planes violating the agreement and understanding between the two liaison officers on the 6th. This is part of the U.S. side's step-by-step plan to tear up the remaining agreements related to the armistice negotiations and ultimately sabotage the armistice negotiations.
　　American generals are now using the Panmunjom neutral zone as an observation post to achieve their secret military objectives. When American planes circled over the conference area and bombed nearby positions on February 4th, American air force generals and other American officers were outside the conference tent looking at maps. American planes have been using the neutrality of the conference area as a shield against anti-aircraft fire to bomb nearby positions, which has become commonplace. The U.S. side's refusal to acknowledge responsibility for these deliberate overflights is clearly intended to encourage the U.S. Air Force to continue making hostile flights and to threaten the safety and existence of the conference area and the Kaesong neutral zone. American bombers and fighters continue to conduct reconnaissance over Kaesong every day.
　　This is consistent with the well-known U.S. strategy of creating provocative actions to sabotage the armistice negotiations. It may be recalled that the U.S. side, despite our protests, has been bombing and strafing the neutral zone, attacking delegation convoys with aircraft, and constantly massacring prisoners of war in order to sabotage the negotiations. When all these provocative actions failed to affect the firm stance of the Korean and Chinese representatives in seeking a just and reasonable solution, the U.S. government interrupted the negotiations last October and rejected the proposal for an immediate ceasefire at the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. government ordered Clark Headquarters to unilaterally tear up the agreement on delegation convoys being immune from air strikes and slandered the Korean and Chinese delegations in Kaesong in order to make it impossible to resume negotiations at Panmunjom. Syngman Rhee's agents and Kuomintang agents were sent to prisoner-of-war camps to create new waves of terror and bloodshed against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in order to force the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to realize Eisenhower's plan to expand the war.
　　Observers here point out that all these signs indicate that Eisenhower is implementing his step-by-step plan to further cut off the retreat routes of his so-called "allies," confront them with more accomplished facts at future United Nations General Assemblies, and force them to participate in wars that expand to other parts of Asia.

### 美方继续破坏会场区协议

    美方继续破坏会场区协议
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道，就在二月四日美方联络官承认炮击板门店会场区的那天下午，美国飞机又在光天化日之下敌意地飞越会场区去轰炸附近的阵位。正当美国飞机飞越会议帐篷的上空时，我方首席联络官朱然上校在联络官会议上再度警告美方联络官：任何虚构的口实决不能帮助他逃避破坏协议的责任，这些破坏行动正在使会场区不可能存在下去。
    美方联络官在六日又一次拒绝承认美国飞机破坏双方联络官间协议和谅解的责任。这是美方要撕毁与停战谈判有关的残存协议，最后破坏停战谈判的有步骤计划的一部分。
    美国将领们现在把板门店中立区作为一个观察所，来达到他们的秘密的军事目的。当二月四日美国飞机在会场区上空盘旋并轰炸附近阵地的时候，美国空军将领们和其他美国军官一起在会议帐篷外看着地图。美国飞机利用会场区的中立性作为免受高射炮火打击的一种护身符，以便轰炸附近阵地，这已成为一种司空见惯的事了。美方拒绝承认这些蓄意飞越行动的责任，显然是为了鼓励美国空军继续作敌意的飞行，并威胁会场区和开城中立区的安全和存在。美国轰炸机和战斗机每日继续在开城上空进行侦察。
    这是与大家所熟知的美方制造挑衅行动以破坏停战谈判的策略相一致的。大家可以回想起，美方不顾我方的抗议，一直在轰炸和扫射中立区，用飞机袭击代表团车队并且不断地屠杀战俘，借以破坏谈判。当所有这一切挑衅行动都未能影响朝、中代表争取公正而合理的解决的坚定立场后，美国政府在去年十月中断了谈判，并在联合国大会上拒绝了立即停火的建议。美国政府命令克拉克总部片面撕毁代表团车队不受空袭的协定，并诬蔑在开城的朝、中代表团，以便使板门店的谈判不可能恢复。李承晚特务分子和国民党特务分子被派到战俘营中，对朝、中战俘制造新的恐怖和流血的浪潮，以便迫使朝、中战俘充当李承晚和蒋介石的炮灰，来实现艾森豪威尔扩大战争的计划。
    此间观察家指出，所有这些迹象都表明：艾森豪威尔正在实行他的有步骤的计划，进一步断绝他的所谓“盟国”的退路，使它们在未来的联合国大会上面临更多的既成事实，迫使它们参加扩大到亚洲其他地区的战争。
