    Several Problems in Shanxi Province's Literacy Campaign
    By Shi Jiyan, Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Illiteracy Elimination Committee
    After half a year of preparation, Shanxi Province began to focus on carrying out illiteracy elimination work throughout the province starting in November of last year. As of January this year, illiteracy elimination work organizations have been established from the province to the county level, with a total of 1,300 full-time illiteracy elimination cadres and thousands of full-time illiteracy elimination teachers equipped and trained. More than 30,000 illiteracy elimination volunteer teachers (mass teachers) have been equipped (the number trained is higher than this), and 60,000 illiteracy elimination instructors have been trained, forming an army of 100,000 people to eliminate illiteracy. Among county and district cadres in the province, 7,734 are illiterate or semi-literate. Currently, 4,755 people have participated in crash literacy classes and completed the intensive literacy phase of learning, accounting for more than 61% of the total. In the summer and autumn of last year, a total of 70,000 workers and peasants in the province participated in crash literacy experimental classes (including 8,000 workers), and all have completed the intensive literacy phase of learning and have moved into the consolidation phase of learning. Since the focused launch of illiteracy elimination work in November, 800,000 workers and peasants have participated in crash literacy learning (including 32,000 workers), and most have now completed the teaching of intensive new characters and have entered the reading and writing phase (the above figures do not include the figures for Yanbei Special District and Datong City).
    From the above situation, it can be seen that Shanxi Province's illiteracy elimination work has made considerable achievements. However, on the other hand, many problems have also occurred. Some of these problems have been solved (such as the original illiteracy elimination plan being too large, which was later reduced), some solutions have been studied and are being implemented, and some have just had some preliminary solutions. Here are the main problems that currently exist and the solutions and suggestions for solving these problems.
    Regarding Leadership Issues
    To do a good job in illiteracy elimination work, leadership at all levels must carry out a series of tasks, the main ones being: repeatedly conducting ideological mobilization, establishing illiteracy elimination work organizations, equipping and training illiteracy elimination cadres, equipping and training full-time illiteracy elimination teachers and volunteer teachers, formulating practical illiteracy elimination plans, and appropriately arranging illiteracy elimination work. Over the past six months, leadership at all levels in Shanxi Province has made great efforts to do a good job in the above aspects, and has achieved initial results. However, no matter which of the above tasks, continued efforts are needed. For example, the illiteracy elimination work organization needs to be filled with key cadres, the quality of illiteracy elimination teachers needs to be continuously improved, the illiteracy elimination plan needs to be verified from the inspection of the implementation, and the arrangement of illiteracy elimination work also needs to be continuously revised from practice. This is in terms of the general situation of the province. In a specific region or factory, the above tasks especially need to be further improved.
    Regarding the Time Issue in Factory Illiteracy Elimination Work
    The central government stipulates that factories can adopt three methods for illiteracy elimination: one is to transfer workers away from production for learning; one is to reduce production by two hours per day, plus two hours of spare time for learning; and one is to extract at least eight hours per week from spare time activities for learning. At present, most factories in Shanxi are using the third method. Taiyuan Machine Factory is using the first method, they extracted one-seventh of all workers from production to learn. According to the experience of Taiyuan Machine Factory, it can be confirmed that at least some factories and mines can adopt the method of transferring workers away from production for illiteracy elimination work. For example, seasonal construction workers can take advantage of the winter months when construction is not possible to leave production for learning; and some factories, after checking, have a surplus of labor, and can also use the method of leaving production to eliminate illiteracy. The specific method is: after the first batch of illiterate workers have finished learning, they can replace another batch of illiterate workers, allowing them to leave production to participate in learning. In factories that do not have surplus labor (mainly large factories), it is also possible to transfer 5% of illiterate and semi-literate workers away from production each time. For example, a factory with 5,000 employees, with 60% illiterate, totaling 3,000 people. Transferring 5% each time is 150 people, only accounting for 3% of the total number of employees. Each phase of intensive literacy takes about one month, and if ten phases are held each year, the task of eliminating illiteracy can be completed in two years. As for the consolidation literacy phase of learning, it can be transferred to the workers' spare time cultural school.
    The method of using spare time activities to eliminate illiteracy, which is adopted by most factories in Shanxi, is also good. However, there is an important issue that must be noted, that is, the weekly learning time must not be less than eight hours. According to the experience of running experimental classes in the past, the intensive literacy phase of factory illiteracy elimination requires about 250 to 300 hours. If eight hours of learning are guaranteed each week, it will still take seven to eight months, plus four to five months for the consolidation literacy phase (six hours per week), it will take about one year. Therefore, factories that use spare time activities to eliminate illiteracy must adhere to the plan of completing a batch in one year, and cannot drag it out for a longer time. If eight hours of learning time cannot be guaranteed each week, then the entire learning time will inevitably exceed one year, which loses the meaning of "crash".
    Regarding the Issue of Teachers in Rural Illiteracy Elimination Work
    The quality of illiteracy elimination teachers plays a decisive role in completing the illiteracy elimination task. At present, there are more than 40,000 full-time teachers and volunteer teachers in Shanxi Province. If each teacher teaches 30 people, they can teach 1.2 million people. Currently, 800,000 people in Shanxi Province are participating in crash literacy learning. In terms of quantity, the teachers are already sufficient. But in terms of quality, there are still big problems. Generally speaking, a teacher must have three basic conditions: have the idea of serving the people, have a considerable cultural level (urban teachers need to have the equivalent of junior high school graduation, and rural teachers need to have the equivalent of higher elementary school graduation), and be able to grasp the spirit and method of Qi Jianhua's crash literacy method. Currently, the illiteracy elimination teachers in rural Shanxi Province, in terms of political conditions, generally do not have big problems, but from the latter two conditions, there are relatively serious problems. In terms of cultural level, among the 7,688 full-time teachers, 4,778 have a higher elementary school level, accounting for 62%, and 1,941 have a lower elementary school level, accounting for 25%. Among the 31,284 volunteer teachers, 12,117 have a higher elementary school level, accounting for 38%, and 16,518 have a lower elementary school level, accounting for 52%. Obviously, it is difficult for more than 18,000 full-time teachers and volunteer teachers with a lower elementary school level to undertake the task of eliminating illiteracy. Especially in the reading and writing teaching stages, the difficulties are even greater. On the other hand, due to the short training time (generally half a month to three weeks), most of the 40,000 full-time teachers and volunteer teachers do not have a sufficient grasp of the spirit of Qi Jianhua's crash literacy method, so they are not good at inspiring the masses' awareness in teaching, not good at concentrating students' thoughts, not good at following the mass line, and not good at connecting with reality. Many teachers still use the vocabulary of the military used during the Qi Jianhua teaching period, such as "attacking fortresses", "capturing prisoners", and "annihilation war", etc. They are not good at using concrete and vivid examples and vocabulary from the lives of farmers.
    Improving the professional level of illiteracy elimination teachers is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in Shanxi Province's illiteracy elimination work. Currently, all parts of the province have studied some solutions to this problem in illiteracy elimination work, mainly: 1. Strengthen the teaching research and transmission system. Establish teaching research organizations at all levels from the county to the village. The county illiteracy elimination office and the district full-time illiteracy elimination cadres form the county's teaching research group; the district full-time illiteracy elimination cadres and the full-time illiteracy elimination teachers form the district's teaching research group; the full-time teachers and volunteer teachers form the administrative village's teaching research group, and the volunteer teachers, instructors, class leaders and group leaders form the class's teaching research group, thus establishing a teaching research organization that is interlinked. The county teaching research group will conduct detailed research based on the needs of each teaching stage and in combination with the problems reflected below, and then transmit it downwards. In addition to the spirit and method of crash literacy, the content of the transmission also organizes everyone to exchange teaching experiences to gradually improve the teacher's professional ability. In addition, combine the transmission work with the inspection and guidance work to study and solve the problems in illiteracy elimination work. In terms of working methods, it is required that the county illiteracy elimination office send people (including the district's full-time illiteracy elimination cadres) directly to the district or district-level transmission station to transmit to full-time teachers and volunteer teachers, in order to reduce the transmission level and ensure the transmission effect. Taiyuan City once used business lectures on Sundays to transmit, which is also a good method. 2. The county illiteracy elimination office and the district full-time illiteracy elimination cadres strengthen the leadership of key illiteracy elimination villages, help these villages to truly move to the front, create some experience, and then convene illiteracy elimination teachers and student representatives from nearby villages to hold teaching observation meetings, which is also a way to improve the professional level of illiteracy elimination teachers. Such teaching observation meetings, if combined with transmission work, would be even better, because this can not only enrich the content, but also save everyone's travel time. 3. Strengthen the leadership of cultural learning for illiteracy elimination teachers. The illiteracy elimination volunteer teachers and full-time teachers in each village should conduct one hour to two hours of cultural learning every day, learning what they teach, which can not only improve the cultural level, but also improve the quality of teaching. This kind of cultural learning can also be combined with democratic lesson preparation. In order to strengthen the assistance of cultural learning for volunteer teachers and full-time teachers, a group of full-time illiteracy elimination teachers should also be drawn out and given a longer period of training to let them serve as "teachers of teachers". At present, the Shanxi Provincial Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee is training 700 full-time illiteracy elimination teachers for this task. 4. It is also a good way to plan to draw a portion of the existing 40,000 illiteracy elimination teachers for short-term supplementary training.
    Regarding the Issue of Consolidating Literacy Results
    The 70,000 students in the Shanxi Province crash literacy experimental classes have all successively entered the consolidation literacy stage and have gained many achievements. The learning methods in the consolidation literacy stage are various, such as transferring to workers' and peasants' spare time cultural schools for learning, serving as instructors in the existing crash literacy classes, organizing reading groups, participating in social and cultural activities and publicity activities, etc. However, in the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage, due to lack of experience, there are still many problems. The most important problem is that the illiteracy elimination work committees at all levels and in all places do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of the consolidation literacy stage. Many places have withdrawn the illiteracy elimination teachers from the experimental classes, and the teachers left behind to conduct the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage are relatively weak, which makes the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage fall into a semi-unregulated state. On the other hand, in some consolidation literacy classes, the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage is seen as too mysterious and they don't know how to start. For example, the Taiyuan Machine Factory Illiteracy Elimination Experimental Class, after entering the consolidation literacy stage, once adopted methods such as having students serve as instructors in crash literacy classes and having students practice writing using the Evergreen writing method to consolidate learning results, but later they were all denied; in addition, they also planned to adopt a large amount of reading of literary and popular reading materials, but later they did not dare to be sure of this method either. In fact, these methods are all available.
    The above two phenomena must be overcome. It should be recognized that without the stage of consolidating literacy, the characters learned in the intensive literacy stage will inevitably "relapse", and may even lose all previous efforts. At the same time, it must also be understood that although there is no mature experience in the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage, it is not too difficult and should not be mystified. The teaching of the consolidation literacy stage has a basic favorable condition, that is, the high enthusiasm for learning of workers and peasants after intensive literacy. With this basic favorable condition, plus someone to manage - illiteracy elimination teachers continue to lead, there are appropriate books and newspapers, and students have a certain amount of time (more than one hour per day), the teaching of the consolidation literacy stage is not very difficult. The teaching method of the consolidation literacy stage should be based on classroom lectures, supplemented by a large amount of group reading, and combined with various other learning methods, such as serving as instructors in illiteracy elimination classes, participating in social and cultural activities and publicity activities. The content of classroom lectures should be based on the textbooks designated by the Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, while the scope of group reading content can be wider, such as "Learn Culture", "Comic Strip Pictorial", "North China People", "Shanxi Peasant Newspaper", "Shanxi Pictorial", etc. The content and form of these readings are welcomed by the masses. As long as we persist in the teaching of consolidating literacy, we will inevitably achieve the goal of consolidating literacy results.

    山西省扫除文盲工作中的几个问题
    山西省人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会副主任  史纪言
    山西省经过了半年的准备，从去年十一月起，在全省范围内有重点地展开了扫除文盲工作。截至今年一月为止，从省到县都已建立了扫除文盲的工作机构，共配备了专职的扫除文盲干部一千三百人，配备和训练了专职扫除文盲教师数千人，配备扫除文盲义务教师（群众教师）三万多人（受训数较此数为多），培养扫除文盲的辅导员六万人，组成了十万人的扫除文盲大军。全省县、区干部中文盲半文盲共有七千七百三十四人，现在参加速成识字班完成了突击识字阶段学习的有四千七百五十五人，占总数百分之六十一强。去年夏、秋两季，全省工农群众参加速成识字实验班的共七万人（其中工人八千人），已经全部完成了突击识字阶段学习，转入巩固阶段的学习。十一月有重点地展开扫除文盲工作以后，工农群众参加速成识字学习的已达八十万人（其中工人三万二千人），现在大多数已完成突击生字的教学，进入阅读写话阶段（以上数字，均不包括雁北专区和大同市的数字）。
    从以上的情况可以看出，山西省的扫除文盲工作是有相当成绩的。但是另一方面，也发生了不少问题。这些问题有的已经解决（比如原来扫除文盲计划太大，后来缩小了），有的已研究出一些解决的办法，正在执行，有的刚刚有一些初步解决的意见。这里把现在存在的几个主要问题以及解决这些问题的办法和意见写在下面。
    关于领导问题
    要把扫除文盲工作做好，各级领导机关必须进行一系列的工作，其中的主要工作是：反复地进行思想动员，建立扫除文盲的工作机构，配备和训练扫除文盲干部，配备并训练专职扫除文盲教师和义务教师，定出切实的扫除文盲计划，确当地安排扫除文盲工作。过去半年多来，山西省的各级领导机关为了做好上述几方面的工作，已经尽了很大的努力，因而取得了初步成绩。但是，无论从上述那一项工作来说，都还需要继续努力。比如扫除文盲工作机构中需要充实骨干干部，扫除文盲教师的质量需要继续提高，扫除文盲计划需要从执行情况的检查中加以核实，扫除文盲工作的安排，也需要从实践中加以不断修正。这是就全省一般情况来讲的。在一个具体地区或厂矿，上述几项工作，尤其需要进一步做好。
    关于工厂扫除文盲工作中的时间问题
    中央规定，工厂扫除文盲可采取三种办法：一是抽调工人脱离生产学习；一是每日减少两小时生产，再加上业余时间两小时进行学习；一是从业余活动时间内每周至少抽出八小时进行学习。目前山西境内工厂的扫除文盲工作，个别的采取了第一种办法，大多数工厂采取了第三种办法。太原机器厂是采取第一种办法的，他们抽出全体工人的七分之一脱离生产进行学习。根据太原机器厂的经验，可以肯定至少有一部分厂、矿是可以采取抽调工人脱离生产的办法进行扫除文盲工作的。比如带有季节性的建筑业工人，可以利用冬季不能施工的期间脱离生产进行学习；又如不少工厂在查定以后，有了一部分剩余劳动力，也可以用脱离生产的办法来扫除文盲。其具体办法是：在第一批文盲工人学习完了以后，可以顶替另一批文盲工人，让他们脱离生产参加学习。在没有剩余劳动力的工厂（主要是大工厂），每次抽调文盲和半文盲工人的百分之五脱离生产学习，也是可能的。比如一个五千职工的厂子，文盲以百分之六十计，共三千人。每次抽调百分之五，为一百五十人，仅占职工总数的百分之三。每期突击识字阶段约需一个月，每年办十期，则二年可以完成扫除文盲任务。至于巩固识字阶段的学习，可以转入工人业余文化学校进行。
    目前山西境内大部分工厂所采取的用业余活动时间进行扫除文盲的办法也是好的。但是，这里有一个重要问题必须注意，就是每周学习时间不得少于八小时。根据过去办实验班的经验，工厂扫除文盲突击识字阶段约需二百五十到三百小时，每周保证八小时学习，尚需七个月到八个月，加上巩固识字阶段的四、五个月（每周六小时），大约需要一年的时间。所以利用业余活动时间进行扫除文盲的工厂，必须坚持一年完成一批的计划，不能再拖长时间。如果每周不能保证八小时的学习时间，则整个学习时间势必超过一年，这就失去“速成”的意义了。
    关于农村扫除文盲工作中的师资问题
    扫除文盲师资质量的高低，对于完成扫除文盲任务起着决定的作用。现在山西省共有专职教师和义务教师四万余人。以每个教师教三十人计，可教一百二十万人。现在山西省参加速成识字学习的是八十万人，从数量上说，教师已经足够。但从质量上说，还存在着很大的问题。一般说，一个教师必须具备三个基本条件：有为人民服务的思想，有相当的文化水平（城市教师需要有相当于初中毕业的程度，农村需要有相当于高小毕业的程度），能掌握祁建华速成识字法的精神和方法。现在山西省农村的扫除文盲教师，从政治条件方面看，一般说问题不大，但从后两个条件来看，就存在着比较严重的问题。按文化程度说，在七千六百八十八名专职教师中，高小程度的有四千七百七十八人，占百分之六十二，初小程度的有一千九百四十一人，占百分之二十五。在三万一千二百八十四名义务教师中，高小程度的有一万二千一百一十七人，占百分之三十八，初小程度的有一万六千五百一十八人，占百分之五十二。很显然，初小程度的一万八千多名专职教师和义务教师担任扫除文盲任务是有困难的。特别是在阅读和写话两个教学阶段中，困难更大。另一方面，由于训练时间较短（一般是半个月到三周），在四万名专职教师和义务教师中，大部分人对于祁建华速成识字法的精神掌握得不够，因而在教学中不善于启发群众觉悟，不善于集中学员思想，不善于走群众路线，也不善于联系实际。不少教师现在仍沿用祁建华教学时期用的部队语汇，如“攻碉堡”、“捉俘虏”、“歼灭战”等等，他们不善于运用农民群众生活中具体生动的事例和语汇。
    提高扫除文盲教师的业务水平，是山西省扫除文盲工作中迫切需要解决的一个问题。现在全省各地在扫除文盲工作中已经研究出一些解决这一问题的办法，主要的是：一、加强教学研究和传授制度。从县到村逐级成立教学研究组织，县扫除文盲办公室和区专职扫除文盲干部组成县的教学研究小组；区专职扫除文盲干部和专职扫除文盲教师组成区的教学研究小组；专职教师和义务教师组成行政村的教学研究小组，义务教师、辅导员、班长和小组长组成班的教学研究小组，这样一环套一环地建立起教学研究组织来。由县的教学研究小组根据每个教学阶段的需要，结合下面反映的问题，加以详细研究后，向下传授。传授内容，除速成识字法的精神和方法外，还组织大家交流教学经验，以逐步提高教师的业务能力。另外，把传授工作和检查、辅导工作结合起来，研究和解决扫除文盲工作中的问题。在工作方法上，要求由县扫除文盲办公室派人（包括区的专职扫除文盲干部）直接到区或区以下的传授站，对专职教师、义务教师进行传授，以减少传授层次，保证传授效果。太原市曾利用星期日举行业务讲座来传授，也是一个很好的办法。二、县扫除文盲办公室和区专职扫除文盲干部加强对扫除文盲重点村庄的领导，帮助这些村庄确实能走到前头，创造出一些经验来，然后召集附近各村的扫除文盲教师和学员代表举行教学观摩，这也是提高扫除文盲教师业务水平的一个办法。这种教学观摩，如能和传授工作结合起来则更好，因为这既可充实其内容，又可节省大家的往返时间。三、加强对扫除文盲教师文化学习的领导。各村的扫除文盲义务教师和专职教师，每日应进行一小时至两小时的文化学习，教什么学什么，这样既可提高文化水平，又可提高教学质量。这种文化学习，还可和民主备课结合起来进行。为了加强对义务教师和专职教师文化学习的帮助，还应抽出一批专职扫除文盲教师，给以较长时间的训练，让他们担任“教师的教师”。目前，山西省扫除文盲工作委员会正训练着七百名专职扫除文盲教师，就是为了担任此项工作的。四、从现有的四万余名扫除文盲教师中，有计划地抽调一部分人予以短期补充训练，这也是一种很好的办法。
    关于巩固识字成绩的问题
    山西省参加速成识字实验班的七万学员，均已先后进入巩固识字阶段，获得了不少成绩。巩固识字阶段的学习方式是各种各样的，如转入工农业余文化学校学习、担任现有速成识字班的辅导员、组织阅读小组、参加社会文化活动和宣传活动等等。但在巩固识字阶段的教学上，由于缺乏经验，还存在着不少问题。其中最主要的问题是各地各级扫除文盲工作委员会对巩固识字阶段的严重意义认识不足，许多地方把实验班的扫除文盲教师抽走，留下来进行巩固识字阶段教学的教师都比较弱，使巩固识字阶段的教学陷于半自流状态。另一方面，在一部分巩固识字班中，把巩固识字阶段的教学，看得过于神秘，不知如何下手。如太原机器厂扫除文盲实验班，在进入巩固识字阶段之后，曾采用让学员担任速成识字班的辅导员、让学员运用常青写作法练习写作等办法来巩固学习成绩，但后来又都否定了；另外，他们还曾计划采用大量阅读文艺性通俗读物的办法，后来又连这个办法也不敢肯定了。实际上这些办法都是可用的。
    上述两种现象必须克服。应该认识到：没有巩固识字的阶段，突击识字阶段认下的字就必然会“回生”，甚至会前功尽弃。同时，也必须了解：巩固识字阶段的教学固然尚无成熟经验，但也并不是太难，不要把它神秘化。巩固识字阶段的教学，有一个基本有利条件，这就是工农群众在突击识字以后的高度学习热情。有了这一个基本有利条件，再加上有人管——有扫除文盲教师继续领导，有适当的书报，学员有一定时间（每天一小时以上），巩固识字阶段的教学并不是很难的。巩固识字阶段教学的方式，应该以课堂讲授为主，而辅之以小组大量阅读，并结合以各种各样的其他学习方式，如担任扫除文盲班的辅导员、参加社会文化活动和宣传活动等。课堂讲授内容，应该以中央人民政府政务院扫除文盲工作委员会指定的课本为主，小组阅读内容的范围，则可广泛一些，如“学文化”、“连环画报”、“华北人民”、“山西农民报”、“山西画报”等等。这些读物，内容和形式均为群众所欢迎。只要能坚持不懈地进行巩固识字的教学，必然可以达到巩固识字成果的目的。
