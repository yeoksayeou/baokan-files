The CCP Anhui Provincial Committee and the Anhui Daily Editorial Department, after reading the "Newspapers in Various Regions Launch Struggle Against Bureaucratism" commentary on newspaper work published in this newspaper on February 1, and the news exposing Lin Jie's mistakes, immediately convened meetings for self-criticism and expressed their complete agreement with the criticism from this newspaper. They resolved to quickly change the shortcomings of not daring to launch criticism.

All comrades of the Anhui Daily felt that the criticism from this newspaper was a great education for them. Upon receiving the February 1st People's Daily, the Anhui Daily Newspaper Committee held an enlarged meeting that evening to discuss the issue. In addition to examining the shortcomings in launching criticism in the newspaper, they also raised concerns to the Provincial Committee about not supporting newspaper criticism. On the 3rd, the newspaper mobilized the entire editorial department to study this newspaper work commentary; on the 4th, it convened a general meeting of the editorial department, where Deputy Director Li Bin made a self-criticism, stating that they completely accepted the People's Daily's criticism. In addition to making a public self-criticism in the newspaper (see separate article), they also decided to thoroughly change the past situation in the anti-bureaucratism struggle, systematically and methodically launching the struggle, especially regarding the Lin Jie issue, which they will persist in fighting to the end.

The CCP Anhui Provincial Committee also convened a provincial committee meeting on the afternoon of February 3 to specifically discuss the People's Daily's criticism. Present at the meeting were Provincial Committee Secretary Zeng Xisheng, Deputy Secretary Niu Shucai, committee members Huang Yan, Li Shinong, Lu Xuebin, Liu Fei, Li Shiyan, Yang Ming, Song Menglin, Zeng Qingmei, Su Yiran, and others, and the Deputy Director of the Anhui Daily was invited to attend. Comrade Zeng Xisheng presided over the meeting. Comrade Zeng Xisheng stated in his speech that he fully supported the People's Daily's criticism. After recalling how the Provincial Committee's leadership over the newspaper had gradually weakened, he said: "When launching criticism in the newspaper, the newspaper did encounter some resistance, and the Party Committee did not struggle against this resistance sufficiently." He then pointed out: "In the current struggle against bad people and bad deeds, we cannot rely solely on the discipline inspection organs; we must fully utilize the newspaper to carry out criticism and self-criticism." Comrade Niu Shucai said in his self-criticism: "The People's Daily criticizes the Anhui Daily for being weak in launching criticism, and the Provincial Committee must also be held responsible for this." Comrade Huang Yan admitted that in 1950, when dealing with the Wanbei Daily's criticism of Liuan County's grain requisitioning, when he encountered resistance from the Liuan County Committee, he did not affirm the correctness of the criticism but instead criticized the newspaper, effectively suppressing criticism, which was wrong. Other provincial committee members, in their speeches, in addition to expressing acceptance of the People's Daily's criticism, conducted self-examinations. In his concluding remarks, Comrade Zeng Xisheng analyzed that the main reason for insufficient support for newspaper criticism was insufficient understanding of the role of the newspaper; secondly, some provincial committees, when criticizing cadres' mistakes, had right-leaning conciliatory sentiments and harbored the thought of "settling matters amicably." Finally, when talking about how to improve in the future, he pointed out: "We must strengthen leadership over newspapers and periodicals, and we should regard the newspaper as an important tool in the Party Committee's leadership work. We must correct past shortcomings, actively support the newspaper's criticism and self-criticism, and struggle against all phenomena that resist criticism." The meeting also decided to establish a Party Newspaper Committee to strengthen leadership over the Anhui Daily.

On February 6, the Anhui Daily published the news of the Provincial Committee's meeting for self-criticism and the Anhui Daily Editorial Department's self-criticism, and published an editorial entitled "Make Our Newspaper a Powerful Weapon in the Hands of the Party and the People." The editorial called on all correspondents, readers, and the broad masses of the people in Anhui to bravely participate in the current struggle against bureaucratism, against commandism, and against violations of law and discipline, expose all bad people and bad deeds, in order to promote the victorious advancement of our national construction cause.

    中共安徽省委、安徽日报接受本报批评开会检讨并决心在报纸上展开批评
    中共安徽省委和安徽日报编辑部，看到二月一日本报刊登的“各地报纸展开反对官僚主义的斗争”的报纸工作述评，以及揭发林杰错误的新闻后，都立即召开会议进行了检讨，并表示完全同意本报的批评，决心迅速改变不敢展开批评的缺点。
    安徽日报全社同志对本报所提出的批评，都感到对他们是一个很大的教育。当接到二月一日的人民日报，安徽日报报社党委扩大会议当晚就开会讨论，除检讨了在报纸上展开批评方面的缺点外，并向省委不支持报纸批评提出意见。三日该报发动全编辑部人员学习了这篇报纸工作述评；四日召开了编辑部全体大会，由李彬副社长作了检讨，表示完全接受人民日报的批评，除立即在报上作公开检讨
    （见另文）外，并决定在反官僚主义斗争中彻底改变过去的情况，有计划有系统地展开斗争，尤其对林杰问题，将坚持斗争到底。
    中共安徽省委也在二月三日下午召开了省委会议，专门讨论人民日报的批评。出席会议的有省委书记曾希圣、副书记牛树才，委员黄岩、李世农、陆学斌、刘飞、李世焱、杨明、宋孟邻、曾庆梅、苏毅然等人，并请安徽日报副社长列席。会议由曾希圣同志主持。曾希圣同志发言时首先表示完全拥护人民日报对他们的批评。他回忆了省委对报纸的领导逐渐减弱的情况后说：“在报纸上开展批评时，报社确实是遇到了某些抵抗，对这些抵抗，党委向其斗争也是十分不够的。”接着他指出：“在当前反对坏人坏事的斗争中，不能光靠纪律检查机关，必须充分运用报纸，开展批评与自我批评。”牛树才同志于自我检讨中说：“人民日报批评安徽日报在开展批评中软弱，这问题省委也要负责的。”黄岩同志检讨在一九五○年处理皖北日报批评六安县征粮问题遇到六安县委抵抗时，未肯定批评的正确性，反而批评报社不对，实际上起了压制批评的作用，这是错误的。其他省委在发言中，除表示接受人民日报的批评外，都进行了自我检查。曾希圣同志做总结发言时，分析了对报纸批评支持不够的主要原因是对报纸的作用认识不足；其次是某些省委对干部的错误进行批评时，有右倾调和情绪，存在“息事宁人”的思想。最后说到今后如何改进的问题时指出：“必须加强对报纸刊物的领导，应把报纸当成党委领导工作中的重要工具，改正过去的缺点，积极支持报纸的批评与自我批评，向一切抵抗批评的现象进行斗争。”会上并决定成立党报委员会，以加强对安徽日报的领导。
    二月六日，安徽日报发表了省委开会检讨的消息和安徽日报编辑部的检讨，并发表了题为“使我们的报纸成为党和人民手中的有力的武器”的社论。社论号召全体通讯员、读者和安徽广大人民群众，勇敢地参加当前的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，揭发一切坏人坏事，以推动我们国家建设事业胜利前进。
