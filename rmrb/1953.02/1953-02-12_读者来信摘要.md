Reader Letters Digest

　　Editor's Note: The following are excerpts from four reader letters continuing to expose erroneous behaviors that waste state assets. We believe that in order to effectively accumulate funds for national construction, it is necessary to practice strict economy and constantly combat erroneous behaviors that waste state assets. We hope that the vast number of readers will pay attention to this issue and continue to write letters exposing the various phenomena of waste of state assets that currently exist.
　　Resolutely Oppose Erroneous Behaviors that Waste State Assets

　　The batch of ginger transported by Zhejiang Provincial Native Produce Company to western Liaoning was completely frozen.

　　Liu Yulin writes: Our Liaoxi Provincial Cooperative Union Supply Department signed a contract with Zhejiang Provincial Native Produce Company last December to purchase 40,000 jin of ginger. The contract stipulated that this batch of ginger should not be frozen or rotten; the packaging should include three to five layers of paper and one layer of straw in addition to bamboo baskets, with the cost borne by our Supply Department.

　　On January 8th of this year, we received more than 50,000 jin of ginger sent by the company. After inspection, this batch of ginger was completely frozen, the ginger skin had white frost, and the inside turned yellowish-white, turning into a puddle of water when placed in the room. The main reason for the freezing was poor packaging and failure to effectively comply with the contract provisions. This not only caused a loss of 150 million yuan of state property, but also affected the edible needs of the people in our province.

　　I believe that the company's irresponsible behavior, which caused the people's property to suffer losses, is unacceptable. It is recommended that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce handle this matter.

　　A large amount of native produce purchased in Qixian and other places has become moldy and rotten

　　Yan Lintai writes: The cooperatives in six counties of Henan Province, including Qixian, Lanfeng, Tongxu, Kaifeng, Zhongmu, and Xinzheng, encountered a situation where a large amount of native produce became moldy and rotten when they were entrusted by the local native produce company to purchase native produce. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 225,000 jin of peanuts with shells, more than 45,000 jin of peanut kernels, and more than 1,000 jin of soybeans became moldy and rotten.

　　The reasons for this situation are: the local native produce company and the cooperative both lacked preparation for the native produce purchase work in advance. The native produce company did not supply packaging in a timely manner; the grassroots cooperatives did not prepare warehouses and rain shelters well before the purchase. As a result, the native produce received each day could not be packaged in time, and there was no warehouse to enter, so it had to be piled in the open courtyard, and there was nothing to do when it rained. For example, Yangyi Cooperative in Qixian County has been purchasing more than 100,000 jin of peanuts on behalf of the county's native produce company since October 18th of last year. They have repeatedly urged the native produce company to provide sacks for packaging; but until November 5th, the native produce company only gave 200 sacks. On November 10th, it rained. Except for 36,000 jin that were packed, most of the remaining 100,000 jin of peanuts were wet.

　　It is recommended that the above-mentioned county native produce companies and cooperatives learn from the experience and quickly improve their future work.

　　The waste phenomenon in the Coal Mine Management Bureau is serious

　　Wu Li writes: The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has serious errors of extravagance and waste and violation of financial regulations. Recently, the bureau added a group of cadres, and bought hundreds of wire beds in Shanghai, and bought many very elaborate seven-drawer desks, swivel chairs and leather chairs in Tianjin. What is especially serious is that they violated financial regulations and misappropriated more than 100 million yuan of start-up funds to buy dozens of musical instruments; because the start-up funds have not been used up, and they are eager to be reimbursed, they plan to use the receipts from the previous purchases of goods to replace them. It is recommended that the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry conduct a rapid inspection and handling of this matter.

　　A large number of teaching instruments in Northwest Agricultural College are damaged

　　Li Fuyu writes: A large number of teaching instruments in Northwest Agricultural College are damaged. According to incomplete statistics, the school damaged a total of 4,008 instruments in 1952, worth more than 70 million yuan. Most of the damage to these instruments was due to carelessness during operation, failure to use them in accordance with operating procedures, or failure to preserve them properly after use. According to the damage investigation, 95% of them could have been avoided.

　　Due to the damage of the instruments, not only has the property of the motherland suffered losses, but also teaching research has been affected to a certain extent. However, the school's administrative leadership has not paid attention to this phenomenon, and has not conducted in-depth education among students on cherishing public property; this has prevented the phenomenon of instrument damage from being corrected in a timely manner.

　　Strengthen leadership over Spring Festival cultural and recreational publicity

　　Wang Guochang writes: The Spring Festival is approaching, and all localities should strengthen leadership over rural drama work during the Spring Festival. The performances of our Linying County rural theater troupe have promoted the development of various tasks and improved the awareness of the masses. However, at present, many village cadres have not led the rural theater troupe well and let it go its own way, especially the performances, which often contain serious feudal toxins, which have had a bad influence on the masses. For example, at the Mule and Horse Exchange Conference in Wangmeng Township, District 7, a Quzi opera troupe performed "Yin and Yang River" on the evening of January 5, with actors dressed as gods, ghosts, and monsters, and the content was even more absurd. Some theater troupes mixed costumes when performing, and did not distinguish between ancient and modern times. Ancient generals wore Liberation Army uniforms; some even used the national flag as a command flag in the play. This phenomenon must be corrected immediately so that the Spring Festival cultural and recreational propaganda activities can play a better role among the masses.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    编者按：下面摘要发表的，是读者继续揭发浪费国家资财的错误行为的四封来信。我们认为：为了有效地给国家建设事业积累资金，必须厉行节约，经常地和浪费国家资财的错误行为进行斗争。希望广大读者都重视这个问题，继续来信揭发目前存在的各种浪费国家资财的现象。
    坚决反对浪费国家资财的错误行为
    浙江省土产公司运往辽西的生姜全部冻坏
    刘玉林来信：我们辽西省合作社联合社供应处在去年十二月和浙江省土产公司签订合同，购买生姜四万斤。合同中规定这批生姜应不冻不烂；包装除竹篓外，应有三五纸七层、稻草一层，费用由我社供应处负担。
    今年一月八日，我们收到该公司送来的五万多斤生姜。经检查，这批姜已全部冻坏，姜皮挂了白霜，里边变成黄白色，放在屋子里就化成一泡水。冻坏的原因主要是包装不良，没有切实遵照合同规定执行。这不但使国家财产损失一亿五千多万元，并影响了本省人民的食用需要。
    我认为该公司这种不负责任，使人民财产受了损失的行为，是不能允许的。建议浙江省商业厅对这件事情进行处理。
    杞县等地收购的大批土产霉烂了
    阎林泰来信：河南省杞县、兰封、通许、开封、中牟、新郑六县的合作社在接受当地土产公司委托收购土产时，发生大批土产霉烂的情况。据不完全统计，共霉烂带皮花生二十二万五千斤、花生米四万五千多斤、黄豆一千多斤。
    发生这种情况的原因是：当地土产公司和合作社双方对土产收购工作事先缺乏准备。土产公司对包装供应不及时；各基层合作社在收购前也没有很好准备仓库和遮雨工具。这样，每日收的土产不能及时装包，也无仓可入，只好都堆在露天院中，天一下雨就束手无策。如杞县阳?合作社从去年十月十八日起代该县土产公司代购花生十余万斤。他们曾多次向土产公司催要麻袋装包；但直到十一月五日土产公司只给了二百条麻袋。十一月十日，天下雨了。十余万斤花生除装起三万六千斤外，其余大部被淋湿了。
    建议上述各县土产公司合作社接受教训，迅速改进今后的工作。
    煤矿管理总局浪费现象严重
    吴礼来信：中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局有着严重的铺张浪费和违反财政制度的错误行为。最近该局增添一批干部，就到上海买了几百张钢丝床，到天津买了很多很讲究的七个抽屉的桌子和转椅、皮椅。尤其严重的是，他们竟违反财政制度，挪用开办费一亿余元买了几十件乐器；因开办费还没有用完，而又急于报销，他们又打算用从前购置物品的单据去顶替。建议中央燃料工业部对此迅速进行检查和处理。
    西北农学院教学仪器大量损坏
    李富裕来信：西北农学院教学仪器大量损坏。据不完全的统计，一九五二年该校共损坏仪器四千零八件，价值七千余万元。这些仪器的损坏，绝大部分是因为操作时不小心、不按操作手续使用或用后没好好保存。根据损坏情况调查，其中有百分之九十五是可以避免的。
    由于仪器的损坏，不但祖国财产受到了损失，而且在教学研究上也受到了一定的影响。可是学校行政领导方面对这种现象还没有引起重视，没有深入向同学进行爱护公共财物的教育；这就使仪器损坏的现象不能及时纠正。
    加强对春节文娱宣传的领导
    王国昌来信：春节快到来了，各地应加强对春节农村戏剧工作的领导。我们临颍县农村剧团的演出推动了各项工作的开展，提高了群众的觉悟。但是，目前有很多村干部没有很好地领导农村剧团，放任自流，特别是演出的节目，常含有严重的封建毒素，在群众中产生了坏的影响。如七区王孟乡的骡马交流大会上，竟有一台曲子剧团于一月五日晚上演出“阴阳河”，演员扮成神鬼怪物的模样，内容更是荒谬。有的剧团演戏时，服装混杂，今古不分，古代的将士，穿上解放军制服；有的还将国旗当作戏中的令旗。这种现象必须马上纠正，以便使春节文娱宣传活动能在群众中起更好的作用。
