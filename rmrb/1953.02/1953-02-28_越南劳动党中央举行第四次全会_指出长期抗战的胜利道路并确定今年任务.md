Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency's North Vietnam dispatch: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held its fourth plenary session at the end of January.

The meeting issued a communique stating: Based on the spirit of Stalin's recent book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the meeting analyzed the international and domestic situation, pointed out the path to victory in the protracted war, and determined the tasks of the entire party and all the people in 1953.

The meeting pointed out that the Vietnamese people's democratic national revolution is fundamentally a peasant revolution. Therefore, we should pay special attention to strengthening the strength of the peasants and meeting their legitimate economic demands. Only in this way can we truly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate the Party, the Peasants' Association, the people's government, and the National United Front, and ensure the complete victory of the protracted war. The meeting reviewed the implementation of land policies during the past few years of the war and determined the five central tasks for 1953:

    I. Mobilize the masses: We must do our utmost to mobilize the masses and implement the policies of rent reduction and interest reduction well, as well as the policy of distributing public land and the land of French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors to the peasants. Special attention should be paid to rent reduction.

    In order to ensure the successful completion of the work of mobilizing the masses, we must pay attention to mobilizing the army, government, people's organizations, and Party cadres, as well as all Party members, to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda work among the masses, especially among the peasant masses.

    II. Strengthen the Party's political leadership, carry out the reorganization and training of the army in order to annihilate more of the enemy's active forces.

    III. In terms of economy and finance: We must cooperate with the work of mobilizing the masses, organize and lead the production increase emulation movement, pay attention to improving the people's living conditions, and strive to prevent possible food shortages and floods.

    Strengthen financial work, unify financial management, strictly abide by financial discipline, and strive to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure.

    Strengthen national trade and bank management, and strengthen the economic struggle against the enemy. Actively carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, corruption, and waste.

    IV. In terms of work behind enemy lines: Continue to carry out guerrilla warfare, carry out counter-"mopping up" operations, in order to consolidate and develop guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases, smash the enemy's conspiracy to establish puppet governments and puppet armies, and oppose the enemy's policies of sabotage, plunder, and political deception.

    V. In terms of Party consolidation work: Coordinate with the work of mobilizing the masses to improve the work of Party organizations in rural areas. Carry out rectification work among Party and non-Party cadres.

The meeting called on the entire Party and the entire Vietnamese people to raise their political vigilance and smash all the enemy's espionage conspiracies.
