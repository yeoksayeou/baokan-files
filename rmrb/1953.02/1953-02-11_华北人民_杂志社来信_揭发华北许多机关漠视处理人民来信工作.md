    Letter from "Huabei Renmin" Magazine
    Exposes Neglect of People's Letters in Many North China Agencies
    Editor's Note: The materials revealed in the letter from the editorial department of "Huabei Renmin" magazine show that, even today, many agencies still adopt an intolerable erroneous attitude towards people's letters forwarded by newspapers and magazines for processing. We believe that the agencies criticized by the editorial department of "Huabei Renmin" magazine should deeply examine their error of not valuing people's letters and seriously and responsibly reply to the people's letters forwarded by the editorial department of "Huabei Renmin" magazine. Their superior leading agencies should also inspect the handling of people's letters by their subordinate agencies and take effective measures to correct the erroneous attitude of these agencies towards people's letters.
Comrade Editor:
    Recently, we studied the People's Daily editorial of January 19, "Seriously Handle People's Letters and Boldly Expose Bureaucratic Evils," etc., and received a great education. We also conducted a preliminary inspection of our readers' letter work. With the assistance of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels in North China, "Huabei Renmin," according to incomplete statistics from April to December 1952, helped readers solve 3,621 cases and problems, and strengthened the connection between the magazine and its readers. However, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of this work by some comrades, shortcomings and errors have also occurred in the work. For example, during the organizational changes in July and August last year, the work of handling readers' letters was divided among various groups without specific personnel being responsible, resulting in some letters and letters transferred to relevant agencies for handling being untraceable, and even cases of lost letters and stubs. These shortcomings have been fundamentally changed due to repeated instructions from the Party, especially after the widely publicized handling of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident." Now, we can seriously study and handle every letter, and readers therefore have more confidence in "Huabei Renmin." Currently, the editorial department receives an average of five or six letters every day criticizing and exposing cases of bureaucracy and violation of laws and discipline.
    In the work of handling readers' letters, we encountered a difficult problem, which is that some agencies still do not value or seriously handle the people's letters we forward for processing. From July to December last year, we forwarded 189 letters (incomplete figures) reflecting relatively major problems to relevant agencies for investigation and handling. In the handling process, the People's Governments of Wenxi and Xiangling counties in Shanxi Province and Luanxian County in Hebei Province handled them relatively promptly and thoroughly. Wenxi and Xiangling counties not only handled the cases exposed by readers, but also inspected the work style of cadres at the same time. Luanxian County, based on readers' suggestions, corrected the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of chestnut trees in Shangjialin and other three villages in the Fourth District, and also inspected the forest protection work in the entire Fourth District, protecting the fruit forests. There were 53 letters handled in a similar way, which is relatively good. Another type is to adopt a delaying and perfunctory attitude, using the excuse of being too busy with work to not actively investigate and handle. Wang Zeyu, a farmer from Wencun Village, Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, wrote 17 letters in succession, accusing Zhang Xin, the director of the village farmers' association, and Liu Panchi, the secretary of the Party branch, of embezzling public grain, raping women, and protecting bad elements. We forwarded the letters to the Cheng'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation and handling on October 28, 1952, but they always used excuses to shirk responsibility and have not yet handled them. Nineteen agencies have adopted this attitude. The most infuriating thing is that some agencies and departments do not hear or respond to the people's letters we forward for processing. Among the 189 letters we forwarded to relevant departments for processing, 85 letters have not been heard from to this day. For example, on September 7 and December 9, 1952, we received two letters successively from Li Panzao, a family member of a revolutionary martyr in Dongdong Village, Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province. The letters stated that his family was originally a middle peasant and was wrongly struggled against during the land reform. The house was wrongly distributed to Communist Party member He Quanhai. Although the county judicial section had re-assigned the house to Li Panzao, He Quanhai did not comply with the judgment, and Li Panzao's family had been homeless for more than two years and did not dare to provoke him. We forwarded the two original letters to the Zhaocheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in September and December 1952, urging them to deal with them promptly, and sent three letters to inquire, but have not received a single word in response. Another example is that Li Zhi, a reader from Xiaodi Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, wrote to expose a reactionary returned home personnel (who the government had issued an order to arrest) hiding in the village. We forwarded this letter to the Raoyang County People's Government for investigation and handling on September 5, 1952, but have not received any reply. Similar situations exist in the People's Governments of Pingshun, Gaoping, Hejin, Pingyao, Jiaocheng, Jiexiu, Yuanqu, Qin County, Shouyang, and the second and third districts of Ruicheng counties in Shanxi Province, a certain military and political cadre school in Taiyuan, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the Hebei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Tongxian Special Office in Hebei Province, and the People's Governments of Shenxian, Pingshan, Yutian, Wuyi, Renqiu, Anguo, Qian'an, Wen'an, Luancheng, Suning, Cangxian, Yongqing, and Wuqiang counties, the Sixth District People's Government of Qian'an, the Women's Federations of the Sixth District of Qian'an and the First District of Fengrun, the Hengshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Luancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, totaling 33 agencies and departments (as well as some agencies originally under Pingyuan Province that are now not under the North China region and agencies in other regions). We have forwarded these agencies to investigate and handle major cases and have sent two to four inquiry letters, the longest period being seven or eight months and the shortest being more than a month. To this day, we have neither seen their handling results nor received a letter telling us the situation. We believe that, to this day, the responsible comrades of the above agencies and departments are still treating people's letters with a bureaucratic attitude. The "Zhang Shunyou Incident" has not awakened them, and they have not seriously implemented the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Work" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has now instructed Party organizations in various places to respond to the letters forwarded by "Huabei Renmin." In addition to continuing to send letters to inquire, we also suggest that the superior agencies and people's supervisory committees of the above agencies help them seriously handle people's letters and inspect their handling of people's letters (including those forwarded by newspaper and magazine editorial departments). In addition, we request the above agencies and departments to tell us the results or situation of the people's letters we forwarded for processing within half a month. We hope that the Party newspaper and readers will support our suggestions and requests.

    “华北人民”杂志社来信
    揭发华北许多机关漠视处理人民来信工作
    编者按：“华北人民”杂志社编辑部来信揭发的材料说明：直到今天仍有许多机关对报纸、刊物转请处理的人民来信，采取了不能容忍的错误态度。我们认为：被“华北人民”杂志社编辑部指责的各机关应该深刻检讨不重视人民来信的错误，并认真负责地答复“华北人民”杂志社编辑部转请处理的人民来信。它们的上级领导机关也应该检查下级机关处理人民来信的工作，并采取有效办法纠正这些机关对待人民来信的错误态度。编辑同志：
    最近，我们学习了一月十九日人民日报社论“认真处理人民来信、大胆揭发官僚主义罪恶”等文章后，受到了很大的教育；并把我们的读者来信工作做了初步检查。“华北人民”在中共各级党委及人民政府协助下，据一九五二年四月至十二月的不完全统计，就帮助读者解决了三千六百二十一个案件和问题，密切了刊物和读者的联系。但是，由于某些同志对这一工作的重要意义认识不足，工作中也发生过缺点和错误，如：去年七、八月间，组织机构变动，把处理读者来信工作分到各组去做，没有专人负责，使这个时期的一部分来信及转请有关机关处理的信无从查考，甚至有丢失来信和存根的事情。这些缺点，由于党的屡次指示，特别是大张旗鼓地处理了“张顺有事件”以后，已有了根本的改变。现在，对于每一封来信，我们都能认真地研究处理，读者因此更加相信了“华北人民”。现在编辑部每天平均收到五、六件批评和揭发官僚主义、违法乱纪案件的信。
    在处理读者来信工作中，我们碰到了一个难题，便是：有的机关直到今天仍不重视或不认真处理我们转请处理的人民来信。去年七月至十二月，我们把一百八十九封（不完全数字）反映出较重大问题的来信转请有关机关调查处理。在处理中，山西省闻喜、襄陵及河北省滦县等县人民政府，处理得比较及时和彻底。闻喜、襄陵两县不但处理了读者揭发的案件，还同时检查了干部作风；滦县根据读者建议，纠正了四区商家林等三个村乱伐栗树的现象，还检查了全四区的护林工作，保护了果林。类似这样处理了的有五十三件来信，这是比较好的。还有一种是采取拖延、支应的态度，借口工作太忙，不积极调查、处理。河北省成安县温村农民王择玉先后写了十七封信，检举他村农会主任张新和党支部书记刘盘池贪污公粮、强奸妇女、包庇坏分子等违法行为。我们于一九五二年十月二十八日转请中共成安县委会调查、处理，但是他们老是借词推托，至今还没处理。采取这样态度的有十九个机关。最令人气愤的，是有的机关和部门，对我们转请处理的人民来信，不闻不理。我们转请有关部门处理的一百八十九封信中，还有八十五封信至今没有音讯。如：一九五二年九月七日、十二月九日，我们先后收到山西省赵城县东董村烈属李泮藻的两封信，信中说他家原是中农，土地改革时被错斗，把房子错分给共产党员何泉海，县司法科虽已把房子重新判归李泮藻，但何泉海不照判决办，李泮藻全家二年多没房住，也不敢惹他。我们于一九五二年九月、十二月把两封原信都转请中共赵城县委会迅速处理，并去了三封信催询，至今没见一字回答。又如：河北省饶阳县小堤村读者李志来信检举暗藏在村中的一个反动还乡人员（政府曾下令通缉），我们于一九五二年九月五日把这信转请饶阳县人民政府调查处理，至今也没回音。像这样情形的，还有山西省平顺、高平、河津、平遥、交城、解县、垣曲、沁县、寿阳、芮城二、三区等县、区人民政府，太原某部军政干部学校，河北省人民政府，河北省人民政府民政厅，河北省通县专署，深县、平山、玉田、武邑、任邱、安国、迁安、文安、栾城、肃宁、沧县、永清、武强等县人民政府，迁安六区人民政府，迁安六区、丰润一区妇联会，中共衡水县委会、中共栾城县委会等一共三十三个机关和部门（还有一部分原属平原省现已不属华北区的机关和外区机关）。以上这些机关，我们转请他们调查处理的案件较大，并都去过两次至四次催询信，日期最多的七、八个月，最少的也一个多月，到今天，既未见他们的处理结果，也不见来信告诉情况。我们认为：直到今天，以上机关、部门的负责同志还在以官僚主义态度对待人民来信，“张顺有事件”也未使他们警醒，他们没有认真执行中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”。现中共中央华北局已责成各地党的组织回答“华北人民”转去的信件。我们除继续去信催询外，并建议以上机关的上级机关和人民监察委员会，帮助他们认真处理人民来信，检查他们处理人民来信（包括报纸、刊物编辑部转请处理的）工作。此外，我们要求以上机关、部门，在半个月内把我们转请处理的人民来信的结果或情况告诉我们。希望党报和读者支持我们的建议和要求。
