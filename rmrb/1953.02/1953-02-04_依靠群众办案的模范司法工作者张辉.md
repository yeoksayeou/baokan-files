    Relying on the Masses to Handle Cases: The Model Judicial Worker Zhang Hui
    Yunnan Provincial Judicial Reform Committee Office

    Zhang Hui, the Deputy Director of the People's Court of Yao'an County, Chuxiong Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has consistently adhered to a clear class stance and a working style of relying on the masses in his work for over two years. He frequently struggles against the old judicial style. At the conclusion of the judicial reform movement in the Chuxiong Prefecture, he was recognized as a model judicial worker.

    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Zhang Hui was once imprisoned by the Kuomintang court for failing to pay grain. From this personal experience, he deeply understood the reactionary essence of the Kuomintang reactionary courts in harming the people. After joining the revolution, under the education of the Party, he gradually realized that the People's Court is a weapon to defend the people's victorious achievements and exercise dictatorship over the enemy. Therefore, when he was transferred to work in the court, he was determined to do this work well.

    In his work, Zhang Hui constantly struggles against the old judicial style and has established a new judicial system that relies on the masses to handle cases. When he heard that some black lawyers were selling a single petition for five or six thousand yuan, or even more than ten thousand yuan, he thought, "Ten thousand yuan can buy three or four liters of rice. When I was an apprentice, I couldn't even earn one liter of rice after a year of hard work." Therefore, he established an inquiry and writing service in the People's Court to answer legal questions for the people and write petitions for free. Once, Zhang Hui saw Liu Xiaolou (who had been a Kuomintang puppet county magistrate) who had infiltrated the court, handling a civil case. The parties waited for a long time, and he slowly walked in, sat high on the "judicial platform," with bailiffs and clerks standing by to serve him. This completely bureaucratic air made Zhang Hui very angry. The next day, he announced that such a style of detachment from the masses would not be allowed in the courtroom anymore.

    When handling cases, Zhang Hui often goes deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, never acting rashly or making subjective assumptions. In January 1951, when he was handling a "poisoning" case, he discovered that the defendant, Zhou Shaozu, was a poor peasant who had served as a village chief in 1950 and led the farmers in the village to actively participate in the bandit suppression work. He had won the honorary titles of "Model Village Chief" and "Bandit Suppression Model" in the entire county. "Why would such a peasant activist suddenly commit poisoning?" So he carefully read the case file and found that the plaintiff was Zhou Yingshou, a lackey of the puppet Bao chief Zhou Xuegui, and he became even more suspicious. He went down to investigate himself. The next day, two farmers secretly said to him, "Comrade, it is difficult to talk about the affairs of our village if you don't come down often." After hearing this feedback, Zhang Hui knew that they had concerns, so he further explained the policy to them. Then, little by little, he learned that when Zhou Shaozu was the village chief, he had taken the lead in struggling against the puppet Bao chief Zhou Xuegui. Now, Zhou Xuegui was not only still in the village, but his lackey Zhou Yingshou had also infiltrated the village peasant association as a clerk. Based on these circumstances, Zhang Hui was even more certain that there was a problem with this "poisoning" case. At the same time, he felt that to clarify the facts of the case, it was necessary to mobilize the masses; to mobilize the masses, it was necessary to defeat Zhou Xuegui and Zhou Yingshou first. Therefore, after reporting to the county leadership for approval, he held a mass meeting. Many people immediately came forward to accuse Zhou Xuegui and Zhou Yingshou of framing Zhou Shaozu. Under the pressure of the masses, Zhou Xuegui and others had to confess the process of framing and falsely accusing Zhou Shaozu. The court immediately announced that Zhou Shaozu should go back, and sentenced Zhou Xuegui and others to imprisonment. The masses were all elated.

    Zhu Tongchun, a former trial judge of Yao'an County (an old judicial staff member), accepted a case of Liu Zengshi, a widow, who committed suicide due to forced marriage. After reading the plaintiff's petition, which stated that the defendant was Liu Zengshi's mother-in-law, Liu Zhushi, he imprisoned Liu Zhushi without any investigation or research. Zhang Hui saw that Liu Zhushi was an old woman in her seventies who could hardly speak clearly. He thought that this case would not be so simple, so he personally went to the countryside to find the chairmen of the poor peasant leagues and people related to the case for investigation. He learned that it was the soldier rogue Liu Conghou who wanted to forcibly marry Liu Zengshi at that time. Later, after inquiring with residents near Liu Conghou's residence, he found out that Liu Zengshi's suicide was entirely caused by Liu Conghou's forced marriage. Therefore, he immediately arrested Liu Conghou and released Liu Zhushi.

    Because Comrade Zhang Hui resolutely relied on the masses in handling cases, a dispute that had been delayed for decades was also successfully resolved. The dispute between the Yi people living in the area bordering Daqiao Village in Yao'an County and Xiaoshuijing in Yanfeng County over a mountain field had been in litigation since the thirteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. However, during the reactionary rule, due to the procrastination and indifference and instigation of the reactionaries, the matter was expanded, and both sides sued and fought every year. Last March, the Yanfeng County People's Court accepted this case, but the judge of the court, Li Zhengfan, subjectively ruled that the mountain field belonged to the Yi people of Yanfeng County without investigation and research. As a result, the Yi people of Yao'an County refused to accept it and sued the Yao'an County People's Court again. When Zhang Hui received this case, he felt that this long-standing dispute could not be resolved by a court judgment alone. Therefore, he enlightened and educated both sides to recall and examine that the dispute was caused entirely by the instigation of the local tyrant Li Chengshan and others. Everyone woke up as if from a dream and said: It was this local tyrant who harmed us. Therefore, both parties sent representatives to negotiate. In the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual concession, the problem was resolved satisfactorily. Afterwards, the masses reflected: The People's Government is really good, and it has eliminated the decades of hatred between us.

    Zhang Hui's excellent work style has further strengthened the connection between the People's Court and the people. Many parties involved in cases that Zhang Hui has resolved go to the court to see him when they come to the city. Some parties involved in cases also write letters to express their gratitude. Zhang Hui's working style of close contact with the masses has set a good example for the people's judicial workers.

    依靠群众办案的模范司法工作者张辉
    云南省司法改革委员会办公室
    云南省楚雄专区姚安县人民法院副院长张辉，两年多来在工作中一直坚持明确的阶级立场和依靠群众的工作作风，并经常和旧的司法作风进行斗争，在楚雄全专区司法改革运动结束时，被评为模范司法工作者。
    在国民党反动统治时期，张辉因为交不起粮，曾被国民党的法院抓去关押过。从这一次亲身的体验中，他深刻地认识到国民党反动法院危害人民的反动本质。参加革命以后，在党的教育下，他又逐渐地认识到人民法院是保卫人民的胜利成果和对敌人专政的武器。因此，当他被调到法院工作的时候，就决心把这一工作做好。
    张辉在工作中经常向旧司法作风不断地进行斗争，并建立了依靠群众办案的新司法制度。他听到有些黑律师卖一张状子要五、六千元，甚至一万多元，他就想：“一万元可以买三、四升米，从前我做学徒的时候，一年到头还苦不出一升米。”于是，他就在人民法院内建立了问事代书处，替人民群众解答法律问题和免费代写诉状。有一次，张辉看见混进法院工作的刘啸楼（当过国民党伪县长），在处理一件民事案件时，当事人等了大半天，他才慢腾腾地走进去，高高地坐上“法台”，旁边还要法警和通信员站着侍候。这一副十足的官僚架子，使张辉非常气愤。第二天他就宣布，在法庭上不准再有这种脱离群众的作风。
    张辉处理案件时，常常深入到群众中去进行调查研究，从不草率从事，主观臆断。一九五一年一月，他处理一件“放毒”案子时，发现被告周绍祖是一个贫农，在一九五○年曾当过村长，并领导村里的农民积极参加剿匪工作，曾获得全县“模范村长”与“剿匪模范”的光荣称号。“这样一个农民积极分子，为什么突然放起毒来呢？”于是他就仔细地翻阅卷宗，又发现原告是伪保长周学桂的狗腿子周应寿，心里就更怀疑起来。他就亲自下去调查。第二天，就有两个农民向他悄悄地说：“同志，你们不大下来，我们村子里的事很难说。”张辉听了这个反映以后，知道他们有顾虑，就进一步的向他们交代政策，随后一点点地了解到周绍祖作村长时，曾带头斗争过伪保长周学桂，现在周学桂不但还在村里，而且他的狗腿子周应寿还钻进了村农民协会作文书。根据这些情况，张辉就更肯定这个
    “放毒”案中有问题。同时，他又觉得要搞清案情，必先发动群众；要想把群众发动起来，必先搞垮周学桂与周应寿。所以就报请县领导机关批准后，开了一个大会，当场就有很多群众纷纷起来诉说周学桂、周应寿诬告周绍祖的事实。周学桂等在群众压力下，只得坦白他们陷害与诬告周绍祖的经过。法院当场宣布叫周绍祖回去，将周学桂等分别判处徒刑。群众个个欢欣鼓舞。
    姚安县前审判员朱同春（旧司法人员）受理一件寡妇刘曾氏因被逼婚而自杀的案子。他看了原告诉状上写的被告是刘曾氏的婆婆刘朱氏，就毫不加调查研究把刘朱氏关了起来。张辉看见刘朱氏是一个七十多岁的老太婆，话都讲不大清楚。他想这个案子不会这样简单，就亲自跑下乡去，找贫雇农主席团以及和此案有关人员进行调查，了解到当时要强娶刘曾氏的是兵痞刘从厚。后来又到刘从厚附近居民处了解，才搞清刘曾氏的自杀，完全是由于刘从厚逼婚造成的。因此就立即逮捕了刘从厚，释放了刘朱氏。
    由于张辉同志在办案中坚决地依靠群众，有一件拖延了几十年的纠纷，也顺利地得到解决。在姚安县大桥村与盐丰县小水阱交界地方居住的彝族人民间为争一块山场的纠纷，从满清光绪十三年起就打官司，但是在反动统治时期，由于反动派的拖延不理和挑拨离间，事情反而扩大，双方年年告状，年年打架。去年三月盐丰县人民法院受理了这个案子，但是该院审判员李正藩不调查研究，就主观地把山场判给了盐丰县的彝族人民，以致姚安县的彝族人民不服，又告到姚安县人民法院来。张辉收到这个案子时，觉得这个长年累月的纠纷，绝对不是法院的一道判决可以解决问题的，因此就启发教育双方回忆，检查出纠纷的产生完全是由于恶霸李成山等唆使所造成的。大家都如梦初醒地说：都是这恶霸害了我们。于是双方就派出代表进行协商，本着互助互让的精神，使问题得到了圆满的解决。事后群众反映：人民政府真好，把我们几十年的仇气都消掉了。
    张辉这种优良作风，使人民法院进一步密切了与人民群众的联系。很多经张辉解决过的案件的当事人，进城时都要去法院看他。有些案件的当事人还写信来致谢。张辉这种密切联系群众的工作作风，给人民司法工作者树立了良好的榜样。
