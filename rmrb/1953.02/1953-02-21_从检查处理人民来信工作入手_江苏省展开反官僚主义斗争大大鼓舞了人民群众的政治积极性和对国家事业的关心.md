Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 20th: The CCP committees and people's governments at all levels in Jiangsu Province have successively launched a struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline. This struggle began with the inspection and handling of people's letters. For more than a year, the people of Jiangsu Province have written many letters to the Communist Party and the people's government. According to incomplete statistics from eight units including the Provincial People's Supervision Committee and the People's Procuratorate, and nineteen cities and counties, a total of 100,000 letters from the people were received in 1952. However, due to insufficient attention paid to the work of handling people's letters by some Party and government organs and state functionaries (including some leading cadres), this work was obstructed and could not proceed smoothly. More than 20,000 letters from the people were backlogged and unprocessed in various places last year. Some cadres even openly suppressed criticism and resorted to threats and retaliation against whistleblowers. For example, Xiong Ti Yun, deputy commander of the Subei Huai River Harnessing Headquarters, suppressed criticism and even detained accusers' letters of complaint to higher party committees. Jing Mingli, deputy manager of Wuxi Coal Industry Building Materials Company, and others even arranged for a meeting of employee representatives to attack critics.

In view of the above situation, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government have issued instructions to party committees and people's governments at all levels in the province, requiring them to check all the letters from the people received in 1952, so that "every letter has a solution" and "every case has a result." At the beginning of this year, four inspection teams were organized, led by Zhu Xidong, deputy secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with personnel from relevant departments of the Provincial People's Government, to conduct in-depth inspections in Taixing and Dantu counties and four units, namely, the Provincial People's Government Health Department and the Civil Affairs Department. At the same time, thirteen investigation teams were dispatched to conduct special investigations and handle cases. In order to strengthen leadership, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred more than 40 cadres to establish an office for handling people's letters.

In the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline in various parts of Jiangsu Province, the report of G.M. Malenkov at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was studied. In the study, provincial-level organs in Jiangsu Province and organs at the prefectural, municipal, and county levels all related the "Huang Yifeng Incident" to examine the work of handling people's letters and various forms of bureaucratic work styles in their respective units in the past. At the first administrative meeting of the Provincial People's Government, the heads of various departments and commissions made self-criticisms of the shortcomings in the leadership styles of their departments. A decision was passed at the meeting, calling on cadres and people throughout the province to carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, boldly exposing the shortcomings and mistakes of government workers at all levels and in all aspects of their work, resolutely fighting against bad people and bad deeds, and decided to strengthen the organization and work of the People's Supervision Committee and the People's Procuratorate. At present, Party committees and government departments at all levels in the province have formulated plans for handling backlogged letters from the people and strengthening this work in the future. The Provincial People's Government Education Department is conducting in-depth inspections in schools based on the issues reflected in the people's letters.

The struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline has greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm of the people and their concern for national affairs, and has strengthened the ties between the Party and the government and the masses. Since the publication of the incidents of Xiong Ti Yun and Jing Mingli suppressing criticism by Xinhua Daily, the number of articles on criticism and self-criticism has greatly increased, and now more than 200 letters from the masses can be received every day. The masses unanimously expressed their support for the wise measures of the Party and the government, and further exposed incidents of cadres' bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline in various places. After the establishment of the Provincial People's Government's office for handling people's letters, it received 27 letters from the people to provincial-level leading organs and leaders on January 28 alone.

    从检查处理人民来信工作入手
    江苏省展开反官僚主义斗争大大鼓舞了人民群众的政治积极性和对国家事业的关心 【新华社南京二十日电】中共江苏省各级党委和人民政府已先后展开反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争。这一斗争的展开，是从检查处理人民来信工作入手的。一年多以来，江苏省各地人民群众向共产党和人民政府写了很多信，据省人民政府人民监察委员会、人民检察署等八个单位及十九个市、县的不完全统计，一九五二年共收到人民来信十万封，但由于部分党、政机关和国家工作人员（包括某些领导干部在内），对处理人民来信的工作不够重视，以致这一工作受到阻碍，不能顺利进行。各地去年积压未处理的人民来信有两万多件。有些干部甚至公开压制批评，对检举人采取威胁报复的手段。如苏北治淮指挥部副指挥熊梯云压制批评，竟扣压批评者向上级党委提出的控诉书。无锡市煤业建筑器材公司副经理景明礼等竟布置召开职工代表会议，对批评者进行打击。
    根据上述情况，中共江苏省委员会，江苏省人民政府曾向全省各级党委和人民政府发出指示，要求将一九五二年所收到的人民来信逐件清查，做到“件件有着落”，“案案有结果”。今年初又组织了四个检查组，由中共江苏省委员会纪律检查委员会副书记朱溪东会同省人民政府有关部门人员分赴泰兴、丹徒两县及省人民政府卫生厅、民政厅等四个单位深入检查。同时派出了十三个调查组，进行专案调查和处理。为了加强领导，中共江苏省委员会抽调四十多名干部成立了处理人民来信办公室。
    江苏省各地在反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争中，学习了马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告。江苏省级机关及各专区、市、县级机关在学习中都联系“黄逸峰事件”，检查本单位过去处理人民来信的工作和各种形式的官僚主义作风。在省人民政府首次行政会议上，各厅、委负责人对本部门领导作风中存在的缺点都作了检查。会上并通过了决定，号召全省干部和人民从下而上地开展批评与自我批评，大胆揭发各级政府工作人员及各项工作中的缺点和错误，坚决地与坏人坏事作斗争，并决定加强人民监察委员会和人民检察署的机构和工作。目前省内各级党委和政府部门已订出了处理积压的人民来信及今后加强这一工作的计划，省人民政府教育厅正根据人民来信中所反映的问题，深入学校检查工作。
    反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争，大大鼓舞了人民群众的政治积极性和对国家事业的关心，加强了党与政府和群众的联系。新华日报自从刊载了熊梯云和景明礼等压制批评的事件后，批评与自我批评的稿件大大增加，现在每天可收到群众来信二百多封。群众对党和政府的英明措施一致表示拥护，并进一步揭发了各地干部官僚主义、强迫命令与违法乱纪的事件。省人民政府处理人民来信办公室成立后，一月二十八日一天内就收到人民群众写给省级领导机关和首长的信二十七件。
