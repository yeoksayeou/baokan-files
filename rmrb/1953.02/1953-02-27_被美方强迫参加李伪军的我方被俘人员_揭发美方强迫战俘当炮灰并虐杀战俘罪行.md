Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 23rd: The US side, under the guise of "releasing" them, transferred 27,000 Chinese POWs from the Yongcheon POW camp to the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder in July last year. This crime has now been further confirmed by another group of witnesses who have fallen into our hands.

According to Qin Yonggen and Li Jishu, Korean People's Army POWs who were forced to join the ROK army, and Che Gen-soo and Kim Seong-tae, who were previously reported, when the armistice negotiations began, the US side sent more than 2,000 Rhee gang special agents disguised as POWs to infiltrate various camps holding Korean People's Army POWs. In addition to a portion of these agents who were long-term lurking, monitoring, and harming POWs, other agents openly established a terrorist organization in the camps called "CMP" (Camp Guard) to serve as accomplices in the US detention and massacre of POWs. Another group of Rhee gang special agents directly served as heads of POW camp regiments, battalions, and companies, and disguised themselves as university students to act as "instructors" in the reactionary "CIE" schools in the camps. In fact, Kim Seong-tae personally saw the identification cards left behind by these "instructors," who turned out to be "intelligence officers" of the Syngman Rhee gang.

Subsequently, the US and Rhee bandit army massacred POWs who opposed forced detention. On August 15, 1951, Korean People's Army POWs in the Geoje Island and Busan POW camps sang to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, and the US and Rhee bandit army carried out three consecutive days of massacre in all camps. According to Qin Yonggen and others who witnessed it, more than 50 POWs were killed and more than 70 were injured in Geoje Island camps Nos. 64, 65, and 84, and Busan camp No. 6.

On February 18 last year, because the POWs in Geoje Island camp No. 62 refused to accept "screening," the US side dispatched a full regiment of US troops called the "Wolfhound Regiment," killing and wounding more than 200 POWs (Note: According to the "International Committee of the Red Cross" report, the number was 373). Kim Seong-tae was working as a handyman in the POW camp hospital in camp No. 64 at the time and personally saw the US POW camp authorities transport more than 80 POW corpses to the hospital for autopsy experiments after this massacre. Four American "doctors" dug out the internal organs of these corpses, and the heads of some corpses were cut off, washed with medicinal solution, and packed in two large wooden boxes and transported to Busan. Afterwards, Kim Seong-tae was also forced to participate in burying these corpses in the deep mountains near Jangseongpo on Geoje Island.

In April last year, the US side transferred a large number of POWs to POW camps on the Korean peninsula. Li Jishu and Qin Yonggen were also transferred to the Yongcheon POW camp. From June 30 last year, the 27,000 POWs in the Yongcheon POW camp were divided into 17 batches and handed over to the Rhee gang. Li Jishu and Qin Yonggen said that before the "release," Van Fleet and Syngman Rhee "inspected" the Yongcheon POW camp to check the preparations for the fake "release." Then the POWs were escorted "home," but in reality, they were directly handed over to the local police station. Qin Yonggen's home was in Kaesong, but the Rhee gang special agents escorted him to his relatives' house on Ganghwa Island in South Korea. After they "returned home," the Rhee gang special agents intensified their steps to force them into the army. They were forced to a dead end, and in order to avoid becoming combat soldiers, they had to register at the US military intelligence agency "Labor Service Office," which was nominally "recruiting odd-job workers" but actually searching for cannon fodder. As a result, they were still escorted to the ROK Army Headquarters Intelligence Department for short-term training before being added to the ROK army.

Qin Yonggen, from Kaesong, was captured in September 1950 and detained in Geoje Island camp No. 68, detention number 88989. Li Jishu, from Seoul, was captured in October 1950 and detained in Geoje Island camp No. 61, detention number 70143.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 24th: The US atrocities of mistreating and persecuting POWs in POW camps are being exposed more and more. The new evidence is provided by another group of POWs who were forced by the US to join the ROK army and who have fallen into our hands.

According to reports from these POWs, the US side violated the Geneva Convention and forced POWs to engage in military and dangerous hard labor, such as building military airfields, barracks, shooting ranges, and highways, and loading and unloading military supplies and ammunition. This kind of slave labor generally lasted for 12 hours a day. In Geoje Island, Busan, Masan, Yongcheon, and other places, POWs were forced to climb steep mountains to excavate and build rocks for airfields. Many people fell to their deaths due to overwork, or were crushed to death by rock collapses. Some POWs did not have masks to protect their eyes when welding military steel plates, so their eyes were blinded by the strong light of the flames.

When POWs were forced to do hard labor, they were often beaten to death or injured by US and Rhee bandit army supervisors and special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs. In Busan and Geoje Island, some POWs were pushed into the sea and drowned by the US and Rhee bandit army at the docks and on US warships for resting or moving slightly, as they were falsely accused of "sabotage" or "escape." In January 1952, Tao Jiansan, a POW from the fourth squad of the 86th camp on Geoje Island, broke a US military wooden box due to overwork while being forced to work. The US military said he was "suspected of resistance" and used a hammer to hit his fingers, crippling both hands. In the same month, a POW from Busan camp No. 6 went to defecate without "reporting" while doing hard labor. The supervising US military actually said he "disobeyed orders" and shot him dead on the spot. In April of the same year, a POW in Busan camp No. 7 was blinded in the eye by the supervising US military for no reason while working. Other POWs protested, demanding that the POW camp authorities abide by the Geneva Convention. The US military arrested the POW representatives and injured many POWs. In various camps, there were a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents sent by the US side, who disguised themselves as POWs and mingled among the POWs. With the support of the POW camp authorities, these special agents formed a terrorist organization called the "Camp Guard" and established many "torture chambers." As usual, the US side called their atrocities of killing or injuring POWs "POW infighting." In April 1952, Li Seung-man special agents from the first squad of the 63rd camp on Geoje Island murdered six Korean People's Army POWs and threw their bodies into the toilet. The next day, the US POW camp authorities conducted an "investigation" and concluded that it was "POW suicide." In the same month, two POWs in the 65th camp were arrested by the "Guard" on the pretext of "organizing a riot" for protesting the poor treatment to the US military authorities on behalf of the POWs and were tortured to death in the "torture chamber" with electric shocks.

The special agents demarcated many "restricted areas" in each camp, forbidding POWs to pass through, in order to cut off mutual contact between the POWs. They arbitrarily formulated various "rules," such as not being allowed to approach the barbed wire, not being allowed to sing, and reporting to the "Guard" for urination and defecation. These "rules" became an excuse for the US and Rhee bandits to kill POWs. For example, in April 1952, Kim Joo-ho, a POW in the 65th camp on Geoje Island, was shot and killed by a US military guard for taking a step or two out of his tent at night and forgetting to "report" to the Rhee bandit special agents. The charge was "attempting to escape." On August 16, 1951, three Korean People's Army POWs in the 64th camp on Geoje Island were shot and killed by camp guards for humming the tune of "General Kim Il-sung's Song."

From the narratives of these eyewitnesses of US atrocities, it can be clearly seen that the old tunes habitually used by the US POW camp authorities when forced to announce the news of POW deaths, such as "POW infighting," "hanging suicide," "entering restricted areas," "attempting to escape," etc., are actually lies used to cover up their arbitrary massacres of POWs.

    被美方强迫参加李伪军的我方被俘人员
    揭发美方强迫战俘当炮灰并虐杀战俘罪行
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美方在去年七月间，曾以“释放”为名把永川战俘营内二万七千名我方被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。这一罪行现在从又一批落在我方手里的人证得到了新的证实。
    据被迫参加李伪军的朝鲜人民军战俘秦永根、李吉洙，和前已报道的车根洙、金星泰说：在停战谈判开始的时候，美方就派遣两千多名李匪特务冒充战俘，混进各个收容朝鲜人民军战俘的营场中去。这些特务除一部分长期潜伏监视和暗害战俘外，其他一部分公开在营场内成立了简称为“CMP”（营场警备队）的恐怖组织，充当美方扣留和屠杀战俘的帮凶。另外一批李匪特务直接充任战俘营联队、大队、中队的负责人，和冒充大学生充当营场内“CIE”反动学校的“教官”。事实上，金星泰亲眼看见过这些“教官”遗落的身份证，原来他们都是李承晚匪帮的“情报官”。
    接着，美李匪军就对反对强迫扣留的战俘进行屠杀。一九五一年八月十五日，巨济岛和釜山战俘营内的朝鲜人民军战俘，因为唱歌纪念祖国解放日，美李匪军就在所有营场内进行了连续三天的屠杀。仅据秦永根等亲眼看见的，在巨济岛第六十四号、六十五号、八十四号营场，和釜山第六号营场内，战俘就被打死五十多名，打伤七十多名。
    去年二月十八日，由于巨济岛第六十二号营场的战俘拒绝接受“甄别”，美方派遣称为“狼狗团”的整团美军，打死打伤战俘二百多名（按：据“红十字国际委员会”报告书，这个数字是三七三名）。金星泰当时在第六十四号营场战俘医院当杂役，亲眼看到美方战俘营当局在这一场屠杀后，还把八十多具战俘尸体运到这个医院去作解剖实验。四个美国“医生”把这些尸体的内脏挖出来，有的尸体的头颅还被割下，用药水浸洗后，装在两个大木箱里运往釜山。事后，金星泰还被迫参加把这些尸体埋在巨济岛上长城浦附近的深山中。
    去年四月，美方把大批战俘迁移到朝鲜大陆上的战俘营中去。李吉洙、秦永根也被迁移到了永川战俘营。从去年六月三十日起，永川战俘营的两万七千名战俘被分成十七批移交给李匪帮。李吉洙、秦永根说：在“释放”之前，范佛里特和李承晚为了检查假“释放”的准备工作，曾“视察”了永川战俘营。然后战俘就被押送“回家”，实际上就是直接移交给当地的警察局。秦永根家在开城，但李匪特务却把他押送到在南朝鲜江华岛上的他的亲戚处去。他们“回家”后，李匪特务强迫他们当兵的步骤就一步步加紧了。他们被逼得走头无路，为了逃避当战斗兵，只好到名为“征募杂役工人”实为搜罗炮灰的美军特务机关“劳务处”去登记，结果还是被押送到李伪军陆军本部情报部受短期训练后，补充到了李伪军中去。
    秦永根，开城人，一九五零年九月被俘，被拘禁在巨济岛第六十八号营场，拘留号码八八九八九。李吉洙，汉城人，一九五零年十月被俘，被拘禁在巨济岛第六十一号营场，拘留号码七零一四三。 【新华社开城二十四日电】美方在战俘营内虐待迫害战俘的暴行，愈来愈多地被揭发出来。提供这些新证据的是落入我方手中的又一批被美方强迫参加李伪军的战俘。
    据这些战俘报告，美方违反日内瓦公约，强迫战俘从事军事性和危险性的苦役，如修筑军用机场、营房、靶场和公路，装卸和搬运军用物资、弹药等。这种奴隶劳动一般每天长达十二小时。在巨济岛、釜山、马山、永川等地，战俘都曾被迫爬到陡峭的山岭上开凿修筑机场用的岩石，许多人因疲劳过度而坠崖跌死，或因岩石崩坍而被压死。有的战俘因焊接军用钢板时没有保护眼睛的面具，以致眼睛被火焰的强光射瞎。
    战俘在被迫做苦工时，还经常被监工的美李匪军和李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务打死打伤。在釜山和巨济岛，有些战俘在码头和美国军舰上劳动时，稍为休息一下或稍一走动，就被美李匪军硬指为“怠工”或“逃跑”而推入海中淹死。一九五二年一月门，巨济岛第八十六号营场四大队的一个战俘陶兼三在被迫劳动时，因疲劳过度而摔坏了美军的一个木箱。美军就说他有“反抗嫌疑”，用铁锤敲击他的手指，两只手都被打成残废。同一个月，釜山第六号营场的一个战俘因做苦工时未经“报告”而去大便，监工的美军竟说他“违抗命令”，当场开枪把他打死。同年四月，釜山第七号战俘营的一个战俘在劳动时，被监工的美军毫无缘故地打瞎了眼睛。其他战俘提出抗议，要求战俘营当局遵守日内瓦公约，美军竟逮捕了战俘代表，并且打伤了许多战俘。在各个营场内，都有大批美方派来的李承晚、蒋介石特务，他们冒充战俘，混在战俘当中。这些特务在战俘营当局的支持下，组成了名为“营场警备队”的恐怖组织，设立了许多“拷问室”。美方照例把他们杀死或打伤战俘的暴行，称为“战俘互殴”。一九五二年四月，巨济岛第六十三号营场一大队的李承晚特务谋杀了六个朝鲜人民军战俘，把尸体抛在厕所里。第二天，美方战俘营当局来做了一次“调查”，结论是“战俘自杀”。同一个月，第六十五号营场的两个战俘因为代表战俘向美军当局抗议恶劣待遇，就被“警备队”借口“组织暴动”而逮捕，送到“拷问室”中施行电刑弄死。
    特务们在每个营场内划出许多“禁区”，不许战俘通行，以断绝战俘之间的相互联系。他们任意订出种种“规则”，例如不准靠近铁丝网，不准唱歌，大小便要向“警备队”报告等。这些“规则”，就成了美李匪帮杀害战俘的借口。例如，一九五二年四月，巨济岛第六十五号营场的战俘金周浩，因为在晚间走出帐篷一两步而忘了向李匪特务“报告”，当即被美军警卫开枪打死，罪名是“企图逃跑”。一九五一年八月十六日，巨济岛第六十四号营场的三个朝鲜人民军战俘因哼了“金日成将军之歌”的调子，就被营场警卫开枪打死。
    从这些美方暴行目击者的叙述中，可以清楚地看出：美国战俘营当局在被迫公布战俘被害的消息时所惯用的老调，像“战俘互殴”、“上吊自杀”、“进入禁区”、“企图逃跑”等等，实际上都是用来掩饰他们任意屠杀战俘的谎言。
