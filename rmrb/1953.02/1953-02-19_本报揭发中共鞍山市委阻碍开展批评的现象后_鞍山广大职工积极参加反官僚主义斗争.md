Following the publication in the People's Daily on February 6th of an article entitled "The 'Worker's Life' Newspaper in Anshan Encountered Serious Obstruction from Bureaucrats While Carrying Out Criticism," the news immediately sparked a huge response among all workers and staff in Anshan on the morning of February 9th. People scrambled to get the newspaper, passing it around, reading it aloud, and discussing it. Everyone unanimously agreed: "It was published at the right time!" "It will be of great benefit to Anshan in carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the future!"

"This is really great news!"

After reading the newspaper's criticism of Sha Youishi, director of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the workers of the Transportation Department unanimously expressed their support and raised many facts about Sha's usual bureaucratic style. When the workers of the ore bridge learned that the People's Daily had criticized Sha Youishi, they shouted with joy: "The Communist Party is really amazing, truly selfless, even Director Sha has been criticized!"

After receiving the People's Daily, the Steelmaking Plant Party Committee immediately organized a study session and prepared to write a self-criticism to the newspaper. Plant Director Ma Chengde personally exchanged opinions with the reporters of the "Worker's Life" newspaper and those who had interviewed the steelmaking plant in the past, inquiring about which of the criticized matters had not been answered and prepared to write a self-criticism immediately. He said: "This time the People's Daily criticized me, and I don't have any resistance in my mind; if it weren't for the democratic make-up class, I probably wouldn't be like this."

The criticism in the People's Daily was also widely supported in various departments of the capital construction system of Anshan Iron and Steel. Many cadres in the Capital Construction Political Department, Metal Structure Company, Mechanical Installation Company, Electrical Installation Company, and construction sites such as Seamless and Large-Scale, carefully read this article. They unanimously believed that this criticism would play a great role in promoting criticism and self-criticism in the capital construction departments. In the past, everyone knew that there were many loopholes and waste in capital construction, but no one dared to mention it. A comrade from the Propaganda Section of the Electrical Installation Company said: "After the People's Daily exposed the obstruction of bottom-up criticism by the Anshan 'Worker's Life' newspaper, it is also beneficial to our propaganda work. There are also situations in our unit where correspondents are suppressed from submitting articles directly to the newspaper. We will write about it to the newspaper tomorrow." At the same time, they also criticized the company's notice stating that "reports from various units to the outside must be reviewed by the company," believing that it also violated the spirit of the Central Committee's decision. The branch secretary of the Mechanical Installation Engineering Team at the Seamless construction site said: "I fully support the criticism of the People's Daily. There are still bureaucrats like Sha Youishi and Ma Chengde in Anshan. This criticism serves as a warning to these bureaucrats. It tells us that those who are engaged in leadership work should strengthen their mass viewpoint." A grass-roots trade union cadre at the Seamless construction site said: "The Communist Party is bright, and the newspaper has openly criticized the shortcomings of the Anshan Municipal Committee." Liu Tienan, director of the Seamless construction site, said: "After reading the article, I immediately checked the backlog of readers' letters on the construction site."

The criticism in the People's Daily played a great role in encouraging correspondents who had been subjected to attacks in the past. Cao Yongkui was moving, and he told reporters:
"I will write an article immediately to support the criticism of the People's Daily." Ding Naiyong said: "The newspaper arrived, and I finished reading it in one breath! It's so satisfying! In the past, I was attacked by bureaucrats for writing critical articles, and I haven't dared to write critical articles for more than a year. This time, I will write about my experiences well and expose these bureaucrats!" Zhao Qizhang immediately wrote an article to the newspaper, expressing that he would better stand on the position of safeguarding the interests of the Party in the future and continue to wage a resolute struggle against bureaucracy.

The greatest response stirred up by the People's Daily in Anshan is also reflected in people's exposure of bureaucracy. After reading this article, a correspondent from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately exposed the problems existing in Anshan's trade work to the "Worker's Life" newspaper; a correspondent from the Bureau of Industry exposed the behavior of Liu Yuyue, director of the Water and Heating Materials Factory, in suppressing criticism... At present, such manuscripts are flying to the "Worker's Life" newspaper's editorial department like snowflakes.

The criticism in the People's Daily brought joy to Anshan, removed obstacles for newspaper correspondents and the broad masses, and also paved the way for the smooth progress of Anshan's large-scale economic construction. As correspondents Zhang Xiduo, Zhao Mengshan, Zhang Lianhe, and Meng Qingzhen said, after this criticism from the People's Daily, bottom-up criticism in Anshan can be launched. We will no longer be afraid of attacks from bureaucrats, and we must wage a resolute struggle against them to safeguard the interests of the Party and the people.

    本报揭发中共鞍山市委阻碍开展批评的现象后
    鞍山广大职工积极参加反官僚主义斗争
    二月六日的人民日报（载有“鞍山‘工人生活’报开展批评中遭遇到官僚主义者的严重阻碍”的文章）于九日清晨到了鞍山后，立刻在全体职工中激起了巨大的回响。报纸被大伙儿争抢着，传看着，朗读着，讨论着。大家一致认为：“登的太对了！”“对鞍山今后开展批评和自我批评好处太大了！”
    “这下子真乐坏了！”
    鞍山钢铁公司运输部职工们读到报上对该部主任沙友石的批评一致表示拥护，并对沙平时的官僚主义作风又提出了不少的事实。矿石桥工友们知道人民日报批评了沙友石后，高兴地大叫起来：“共产党真了不起，真是大公无私，沙主任都被批评啦！”
    炼钢厂收到人民日报后，党委会马上组织了学习，并准备给报纸写检讨。厂长马成德并亲自到“工人生活”报和过去采访炼钢厂的记者交换意见，询问过去都是那些被批评了的事没有答复，准备立刻写检讨。他说：“这次人民日报批评我，我并没有一点抗拒思想；如果不是经过民主补课，恐怕还不会是这样的。”
    人民日报的批评在鞍钢基本建设系统各部门也受到普遍拥护。基本建设政治部、金属结构公司、机械安装公司、电气安装公司、无缝、大型等工地的许多干部，都仔细地读了这篇文章。他们一致认为：这次批评对于推动基本建设部门开展批评和自我批评有很大作用。以前，明知基本建设中漏洞多浪费大，但谁也不敢提。电气安装公司宣教科的同志说：“人民日报揭发鞍山‘工人生活’报自下而上的批评受到阻碍后，对我们宣传工作也有好处。我们本单位也有压制通讯员直接向报社投稿的情况，明天我们就把它写给报社。”同时他们对公司发的
    “各单位向外报道要经过公司审查”的通知也提出了批评，认为同样是违背了党中央决定的精神。无缝工地机械安装工程队支部书记说：“我十分拥护人民日报的批评。鞍山类似沙友石、马成德这样的官僚主义者还是有的。这次批评给这些官僚主义者敲了警钟。这告诉我们做领导工作的要好好地加强群众观点。”无缝工地一个基层工会干部说：“共产党是光明的，鞍山市委有了缺点，报纸上也进行了公开批评。”无缝工地主任刘铁男说：“我看到文章后，马上检查了工地积压读者来信情况。”
    人民日报的批评对过去受过打击的通讯员起了莫大的鼓舞作用。曹永魁正在搬家，他对记者说：
    “我要马上写稿子，拥护人民日报的批评。”丁乃雍说：“报纸来了，我一口气看完了它！这才解渴呢！过去我写批评稿受到官僚主义者的打击，一年多没敢写批评稿。这一回，我要把我的遭遇好好写写，揭发这些官僚主义者！”赵启璋并立即写稿给报社，表示他今后要更好地站在维护党的利益的立场上，继续和官僚主义作坚决斗争。
    人民日报在鞍山激起的最大的回响，还表现在人们对官僚主义的揭发上。市工商局的通讯员读了这篇文章后，立即向“工人生活”报揭发了鞍山贸易工作中存在的问题；工业局的通讯员揭发了水暖材料厂厂长刘玉岳压制批评的行为……，目前，这类稿件正如雪片似地飞向“工人生活”报编辑部。
    人民日报的批评给鞍山带来了喜气，给报纸通讯员和广大群众扫除了障碍，也给鞍山大规模的经济建设的顺利前进开辟了道路。正如通讯员张喜多、赵梦珊、张连和、孟庆祯等所说的，经过人民日报这一批评，鞍山的自下而上批评可以展开了。我们今后不再怕官僚主义者的打击，为维护党和人民的利益一定要和他们进行坚决斗争。
