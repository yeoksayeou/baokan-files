Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, February 9th: According to TASS, at the Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, when discussing the economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries, the Soviet representative, Nemchina, pointed out that the report prepared by the Commission's Secretariat did not reveal the reasons for the economic backwardness and the tragic situation of the people in Asian countries. Nemchina exposed the report's attempt to attribute the deterioration of the living conditions of the people in Asia and the Far East to the rapid increase in population. Nemchina said that in reality, the poverty and hunger of the masses of people in backward countries were the result of the predatory policies adopted by monopoly capitalists from the United States and other countries towards these countries, as well as the result of the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership systems in most Asian and Far Eastern countries.

Nemchina then cited many examples to prove the rapid economic progress of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union's Asian republics, which have far outstripped their neighbors and backward countries in terms of the level of industrial development.

Nemchina finally emphasized that in terms of international policy, there are two lines regarding the economic development of Asian and Far Eastern countries. One is the line of the United States and other colonial countries, which aims to systematically plunder the people of backward countries and use their territories to realize American aggression plans. The other is the Soviet Union's line, which is to develop trade and economic cooperation with Asian and Far Eastern countries on the basis of mutual benefit, equal principles, and respect for the sovereignty of all parties concerned. The Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy fully conforms to the basic national interests of the people of Asian and Far Eastern countries.

The Soviet representative submitted to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East a draft resolution on promoting the development of national industries in Asian and Far Eastern countries. The draft resolution suggests that the governments of Asian and Far Eastern countries pay special attention to the development of national industries, take measures to protect national industries, establish protective tariffs and systems that are more favorable to national enterprises, and prohibit the sale of these enterprises to foreign capitalists to resist destructive foreign competition.

Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: According to TASS, Bandung: The Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East opened in Bandung, Indonesia, on the 6th.

At the meeting, the Soviet representative, Nemchina, pointed out that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China was still illegally occupied at this session by Kuomintang elements who had nothing to do with the great Chinese people. Nemchina pointed out the great importance of normal economic relations between Southeast Asian countries and China, and pointed out the losses caused to the work of the Commission due to the lack of a legitimate representative of China.

The Soviet representative's speech won warm applause from the Indonesians attending the meeting.

The Soviet representative proposed a motion to expel the Kuomintang elements and invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting. Thailand moved to delay the consideration of the Soviet proposal until the Commission's next session. The representatives of Thailand, the Philippines, and the United States, through procedural conspiracies, forced the chairman to put the motion proposed by Thailand to a vote. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and Burma voted against the Thai proposal. However, the proposal was passed with the votes of the colonial countries and some countries dependent on them.

    联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议在万隆开幕
    苏联代表建议促进亚洲国家民族工业发展
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社万隆九日讯：在联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议讨论亚洲及远东国家的经济情势时，苏联代表涅姆钦纳指出：委员会秘书处所准备的报告，没有揭露亚洲国家的经济落后和人民的悲惨情况的原因。涅姆钦纳揭穿了报告的企图——把亚洲及远东国家人民生活条件恶化的原因说成是人口增加太快。涅姆钦纳说：实际上落后国家人民群众的贫困和饥饿，是美国和其他国家的垄断资本家对这些国家采取的掠夺政策所造成的结果，也是在亚洲及远东大多数国家中封建及半封建的土地所有制所造成的结果。
    涅姆钦纳接着举出许多例子，证明中华人民共和国和苏联的亚洲各共和国在经济上的迅速进步，它们在工业发展的水平方面已经使它们的邻国和落后国家远远地落在后面了。
    涅姆钦纳最后强调说：在国际政策方面，关于亚洲及远东国家的经济发展有两条路线。一条是美国及其他殖民国家的路线，它的目的在于有计划地掠夺落后国家的人民，利用它们的领土实现美国侵略计划。另一条是苏联的路线，它是为了在互利的基础上、在平等的原则和尊重有关各方的主权的基础上，发展和亚洲及远东国家的贸易与经济合作。苏联的爱好和平的外交政策，完全符合亚洲及远东各国人民的基本的民族利益。
    苏联代表向亚洲暨远东经济委员会提出关于促进亚洲及远东国家民族工业发展的一项决议草案。决议草案建议亚洲及远东国家的政府特别重视民族工业的发展，采取保护民族工业的措施，建立保护关税及对民族企业更有利的制度、禁止把这些企业出售给外国资本家，以抵御外国毁灭性的竞争。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社万隆讯：联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议六日在印尼的万隆开幕。
    苏联代表涅姆钦纳在会上指出：中华人民共和国的合法地位在这一届会议上依然被和伟大中国人民无任何关系的国民党分子所非法占据。涅姆钦纳指出东南亚国家和中国之间的正常经济关系的巨大重要性，并指出因缺乏中国的合法代表而对委员会的工作所造成的损失。
    苏联代表的发言博得了旁听会议的印尼人的热烈掌声。
    苏联代表提出了驱逐国民党分子并邀请中华人民共和国的代表出席会议的提案。泰国提出动议，要求延迟到委员会下届会议再审议苏联的提案。泰国、菲律宾和美国的代表借着程序的阴谋强迫主席把泰国所提的动议交付表决。苏联、印度、印尼和缅甸投票反对泰国的提案。但这个提案靠着殖民国家和依附它们的一些国家的票数而被通过。
