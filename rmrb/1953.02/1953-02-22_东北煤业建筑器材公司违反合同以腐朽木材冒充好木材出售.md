According to a report by the Supreme People's Procuratorate Timber Inspection Team: The Northeast Coal Industry Building Materials Company violated its contract and mixed over 52,000 cubic meters of rotten wood into the more than 243,000 cubic meters of wood transported into the customs region, causing significant losses to the state.

In the spring of 1952, the former Northeast Forestry Department cleared out approximately 800,000 cubic meters of wood that had been felled and left over from the Japanese puppet regime. In April of last year, the China Coal Construction Company and the Northeast Coal Construction Company formed an agreement to handle this wood, and in May they signed a contract for wood to be transported into the customs region. The contract stipulated that the Northeast Coal Construction Company would process and transport 500,000 cubic meters of wood into the region to supply construction units and market needs. The grade of the processed wood entering the region was specified as 20 percent first and second grade, 50 percent third grade, and 30 percent fourth grade. The specifications were that boards should account for 40 percent of the total finished wood, with a length of 1.5 meters or more. Because the Northeast's processing capacity was limited, the contract stipulated that a portion of logs could be sent into the region, but not exceeding 30 percent of the total amount of wood entering the region; logs with a utilization rate below 40 percent were not allowed to enter the region. The contract also stipulated that the Northeast Coal Construction Company should be responsible for guaranteeing specifications and quality. As of October of last year, the Northeast Coal Construction Company had transported over 243,000 cubic meters of wood into the region (including 165,770 cubic meters of finished wood and 77,600 cubic meters of logs), of which 52,900 cubic meters were rotten wood (including 25,199 cubic meters of substandard finished wood and 27,700 cubic meters of substandard logs). This rotten wood was passed off as good wood and transported from the forest area to Harbin and Shenyang for processing before being transported into the region and distributed to various parts of North China. According to statistics, transporting this rotten wood required 1,426 rail cars, and transportation and miscellaneous expenses alone amounted to 14.426 billion yuan. Many of these rotten logs were hollow at both ends to the point that a person could crawl inside, which workers called "telescopes." Some of the wood broke when unloaded from the trucks, some crumbled underfoot, and some turned to powder when touched by hand. Yet, they were mixed with good wood and transported into the region to participate in basic construction. Coal construction companies in various parts of North China even sold much of this wood to construction units, passing off substandard materials as fourth-grade materials and inferior materials as good materials. Some units reluctantly used this wood in construction projects, which directly affected the quality of the construction projects. For example, a unit of the Public Security Forces bought a batch of wood entering the region from the Shijiazhuang Coal Construction Company to build a hospital. They picked a few better pieces to use as rafters, but two of the rafters broke before they were even installed on the roof frame. According to construction workers, using this batch of wood would reduce the lifespan of the building by half. This loss is difficult to calculate. A large quantity of the rotten wood cannot be used as building materials at all, which essentially means that the state has accumulated and wasted a large amount of funds, causing significant losses to state property.

Why was this batch of rotten wood transported into the region? First, the Northeast Coal Construction Company did not attach importance to the wood entry contract signed with the China Coal Construction Company. They did not seriously convey, discuss, and study the task of processing 500,000 cubic meters of wood for entry into the region. Many cadres not only did not understand the significance of wood entry, but also did not know the contents of the contract. Xue Boqin of the company's wood group said: "The wood entering the region does not need to be graded into first, second, or third grade, as long as it is good enough to be fourth grade." Cui Mengyun, who was responsible for transportation at the Nancha Forestry Area Office, even announced at a transportation meeting: "Fourth-grade materials can be loaded and transported into the region with a utilization rate of 35 percent." In this way, they lowered the specifications and quality of the wood entering the region. Second, the Northeast Coal Construction Company blindly pursued the material yield rate. According to the investigation, in May and June of last year, the Coal Construction Companies in Shenyang and Harbin generally increased the material yield rate to 84 percent or even 94 percent (in fact, the material yield rate of first and second-grade logs can only reach 82.5 percent); Xie Yutian, the deputy manager of the Northeast Coal Construction Company, once instructed at a business section chief meeting: "To improve the material yield rate, pay attention to producing materials according to the quantity, and the district company's test results show that the material yield rate can reach 88 percent." When entrusting private factories for processing, the Shenyang Coal Construction Company stipulated that the material yield rate should be 90 percent. When carrying out the task of wood entry into the region, the Shenyang and Harbin Coal Construction Companies even processed old logs as new logs and transported old materials as new materials into the region. They also extracted and sold good materials and transported inferior materials into the region. When loading materials to enter the region, Yu Zhenzhong, a site member of the Shenyang Second Building Materials Factory, sighed when he saw some good materials being loaded onto the trucks: "It's a pity that such good wood is also being transported into the region!" His statement can represent the thinking of some leading cadres in the Northeast Coal Construction Company system.

The reason why this batch of rotten wood was able to be transported into the region in a continuous stream, in addition to the bureaucratic style, localism, and capitalist thinking in management of the leading cadres of the Northeast Coal Construction Company mentioned above, is also due to the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of the China Coal Construction Company, who did not check the implementation of the contract for wood entering the region. The units in various parts of North China that inspected this batch of wood did not conduct strict inspections, and their irresponsible attitude towards state property and customers also contributed to the continuation of this incident. It was not until June 25th of last year when the People's Daily reader's letter revealed the serious situation of rotten wood entering the region, and the Central Railway Ministry Public Security Bureau reflected on July 3rd of last year that a fire accident occurred on the train transporting wood in Yinma River. After this, the Supreme People's Procuratorate organized an inspection team in mid-July of last year and sent personnel to Shenyang, Harbin, and the forest area for inspection. Later, they also invited personnel from the Central Ministry of Commerce, the Northeast Ministry of Trade, and the China Coal Construction Company, the Northeast Coal Construction Company, and the North China Coal Construction Company to cooperate and continue the inspection in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and other places in October of last year, only then was this case clarified. The Supreme People's Procuratorate is now studying the handling opinions for this case.

    东北煤业建筑器材公司违反合同以腐朽木材冒充好木材出售
    据最高人民检察署木材检查小组报道：东北煤业建筑器材公司违反合同，竟在运进关的二十四万三千多立方公尺木材当中，掺杂了五万二千多立方公尺腐朽木材，给国家造成了重大损失。
    一九五二年春季，原东北林业部在林区清理出日伪时期砍伐留存的木材约八十万立方公尺，去年四月，中国煤建公司与东北煤建公司就处理这批木材成立了协议，去年五月又签订了木材进关合同，规定由东北煤建公司把五十万立方公尺木材加工运进关内，供应建筑单位和市场需要。加工进关的木材的等级规定为一、二等材占百分之二十，三等材占百分之五十，四等材占百分之三十，规格是板材占成材总数的百分之四十，长度为一点五公尺以上。因东北加工能力有限，合同规定可酌发部分原木进关，但不能超过全部进关木材数量的百分之三十；利用率在百分之四十以下者不得进关。合同中并规定东北煤建公司应负规格质量的保证责任。至去年十月份止，东北煤建公司运进关的木材共有二十四万三千多立方公尺（内成材十六万五千七百七十立方公尺，原木七万七千六百立方公尺），其中腐朽木材有五万二千九百立方公尺（内等外材二万五千一百九十九立方公尺，等外原木二万七千七百立方公尺）。这些腐朽木材被充作好木材从林区运到哈尔滨、沈阳加工后再运进关，分配到华北各地。据统计，运这些腐朽木材要用一千四百二十六个车皮，仅运杂费就要开支一百四十四亿二千六百多万元。这些腐朽木材中，有不少原木两头空得能钻进一个人去，工人们称之为“望远镜”。有些木材在卸车时一扔就断了，有些木材脚一踩就碎，用手一抓就成粉末。但它们却被混杂在好木材中运进关来参加基本建设。而华北各地煤建公司竟以等外材充四等材、以劣材充好材卖了许多给各建筑单位。有的单位勉强把这些木材用于工程上，这就直接影响了建筑工程的质量。例如公安部队某部向石家庄市煤建公司买了一批进关木材去修建医院，挑了几根较好的做椽子，还没上房架，就有两根椽子断了。据建筑工人说，用这批木材要使房屋减少一半寿命。这种损失是难以计算的。大批的腐朽木材根本不能作建筑材料使用，这实质上是积压和浪费了国家大量资金，使国家财产遭受重大损失。
    为什么这批腐朽木材会被运进关呢？首先是东北煤建公司并不重视他们与中国煤建公司所订的木材进关合同。他们对于加工五十万立方公尺木材进关的任务并未认真传达讨论研究，许多干部不仅不懂得木材进关的意义，也不知道合同的内容，该公司木材组薛伯钦说：“进关木材不分一、二、三等，只要够四等就行”。南岔林区办事处负责运输的崔梦云在运输会议上更宣布：“四等材可以按百分之三十五的利用率装车进关。”他们就这样降低了进关木材的规格质量。其次是东北煤建公司盲目追求出材率。据调查：沈阳、哈尔滨两市煤建公司在去年五、六月间，一般将出材率提高到百分之八十四甚至百分之九十四（实际上连一、二等原木制材的出材率也只能达到百分之八十二点五）；东北煤建公司副经理谢雨天在业务科长会议上曾指示说：
    “提高出材率要注意量材出材，区公司试验结果出材率达到百分之八十八。”沈阳市煤建公司委托私营厂加工时规定出材率为百分之九十。沈阳、哈尔滨两市煤建公司在执行木材进关任务时，竟以陈原木顶新原木加工，陈材顶新材进关。并且抽卖好材，把次材运进关内。沈阳第二建材厂现场员于振忠在装车进关时，看到有些好材被装上车，竟叹息说：“这样好的木材也运进关去，真可惜！”他这个说法可以代表东北煤建公司系统若干领导干部的思想。
    这批腐朽木材之所以能够源源运到关里，除了上述东北煤建公司领导干部的官僚主义作风、本位主义思想以及经营当中的资本主义思想作怪以外，中国煤建公司领导干部的官僚主义作风严重，不检查进关木材合同执行情况，华北各地煤建公司验收这批木材的单位验收不严，他们对国家财产和对顾主不负责任的态度，也助长了这件事的延续。直到去年六月二十五日人民日报读者来信揭发了朽木进关的严重情况，中央铁道部公安局去年七月三日又反映运木材的火车在饮马河发生失火事故以后，最高人民检察署于去年七月中旬组织检查组，派员去沈阳、哈尔滨以及林区进行检查，以后又请中央商业部、东北贸易部以及中国煤建公司、东北煤建公司、华北煤建公司派员配合，于去年十月份分别在北京、天津、石家庄、太原等地继续检查，才弄清了这一案件。现在最高人民检察署正在研究这个案件的处理意见。
