    Only with Correct Design Ideology Can There Be Correct Design
    Zhuang Guoshen, Engineer of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant
    I joined the design work of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant very early. The entire design process has been our learning process. We learned from successful experiences and failed lessons, and gradually changed our design ideas and improved our professional skills through learning. Here, Soviet experts gave us decisive help in terms of ideology and technology.
    Soviet experts pointed out the errors in our preliminary design, told us the principles of design, and made us realize that only with correct design ideology can there be correct design.
    The vast majority of our designers were educated under capitalism in the past, and their minds were filled with capitalist design ideas, worshiping the technical standards of Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan. In July and August of 1950, at design seminars, we often heard many comrades introduce the Krupp factory in Germany and the Allis-Chalmers factory in the United States, taking them as models for design. However, these two factories were blindly and unplannedly expanded step by step in the capitalist era. At that time, we did not understand that the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant was a socialist factory, and it could not blindly and unlimitedly expand without being detached from the national economic plan. We regarded Krupp and other factories as classics, attempting to move them to the People's China as they were. Therefore, in the preliminary design, we left too much room for expansion for each workshop, preparing to expand them into an independent factory in the future. We did not consider at all that a factory built according to such a design would make transportation within the factory inconvenient, affect the shortening of production time, and hinder the reduction of costs. We also did not proceed from reality when deciding on product types and selecting equipment. The products we decided on at that time included the most precise lathes and the roughest mining machinery; the largest smelting equipment and the smallest cranes. In short, we wanted everything, attempting to turn this factory into an "omnipotent factory." The selection of factory equipment was blindly seeking big and many. We listed all the large machine tool equipment found in sample catalogs in capitalist countries, without considering economic rationality or the relationship between equipment capacity and product output, thinking that "to run a large factory, one must spend a lot of money, and one cannot appear stingy." As a result, the actual production capacity exceeded the designed production capacity, and the actual production capacity of the medium forging workshop (calculated according to Soviet indicators) even exceeded the designed capacity by more than ten times!
    The errors in the preliminary design were not just these; the above are just the more prominent ones. We should thank Soviet expert Comrade Krimsky. In the spring of 1951, when he reviewed the preliminary design in Beijing, he pointed out and corrected our mistakes, saving the factory from a design that was wrong in principle. Later, he came to Taiyuan to meet with us and repeatedly warned us: basic construction is a century-long plan and must not be sloppy. Designers should do design work with a spirit of responsibility to the people, conduct thorough investigations, and make accurate calculations. What is especially important is to consider the factory's economic rationality and technical advancement. For example, the nature of product items should be similar, and the degree of precision of processing objects should not be too disparate, because only in this way will operational difficulties not occur during production, and equipment can be fully utilized. The Soviet expert put forward these opinions before the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee announced the interim procedures for basic construction, so it was particularly helpful to the design of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. We designers were educated in capitalist theories and technologies for one or twenty years and never learned this knowledge, but the Soviet expert told us all in just one day, which cannot but make us extremely grateful.
    However, we had too short a time to contact the Soviet expert. Comrade Krimsky returned to his country soon after. How to specifically implement the principles instructed by the Soviet expert into the technical design was a very difficult problem. This depended on whether we could treat the opinions of the Soviet expert with a correct attitude.
    Our experience is: we can achieve good results in the technical design in the area where we can thoroughly understand the opinions of the Soviet experts; conversely, as long as we are a little arrogant, do not humbly learn from them, and do not repeatedly understand their opinions, we will make mistakes.
    We have made mistakes because we did not understand and implement the opinions of the Soviet experts well. I can give two examples to illustrate.
    When Comrade Krimsky was about to leave, he repeatedly warned us: in every design link, we must make accurate calculations and careful considerations, and we must not be careless or perfunctory. This is a spirit of seeking truth from facts and a manifestation of high responsibility. We did not implement this spirit when designing the indoor overhead crane in the cold working workshop. The crane we ordered was clearly manufactured by Shanghai General Machinery Factory, but in the design, we calculated according to the specifications of the Soviet-made crane. In fact, the specifications and quality of the two are different. We only knew how to mechanically apply Soviet technical quotas, but we ignored this difference. Fortunately, this error was discovered and temporarily corrected during construction.
    Soviet experts pay great attention to technical safety and welfare facilities. This is because socialist enterprises not only require the production of inexpensive and high-quality products, but also ensure that employees work in safe and pleasant conditions. We, who have not undergone a more thorough ideological transformation and do not understand the suffering of the working people, often overlook this principle. When designing certain workshops, we once decided to use wooden roofing panels, which violated safety regulations and thermal insulation conditions. For example, gas pipelines in the workshop should be placed in the air so as not to harm the health of employees, but we placed them underground. These errors were corrected only after being pointed out by others.
    More than two years of experience and lessons tell us that only with correct design ideology can we make correct designs. We—engineering and technical personnel who more or less have bourgeois design ideas—having decided to dedicate ourselves to the great economic construction of the motherland, then let us resolutely transform the old design ideas so as to perfectly complete the important task entrusted to us by the motherland.

### 有了正确的设计思想才有正确的设计

    有了正确的设计思想才有正确的设计
    太原重型机器厂工程师　庄国绅
    我很早就参加了太原重型机器厂的设计工作。整个设计的过程，就是我们学习的过程。我们从成功的经验和失败的教训中学习，从学习中逐渐改变了设计思想，提高了业务水平。在这里，苏联专家从思想上和技术上给了我们以决定性的帮助。
    苏联专家指出我们初步设计中的错误，告诉我们设计的原则，使我们认识到有了正确的设计思想才能有正确的设计。
    我们绝大多数的设计人员，过去都是受的资本主义的教育，脑子里装满资本主义的设计观点，崇拜英、美、德、日的技术标准。一九五○年七、八月间，在设计座谈会上，我们常常听到许多同志介绍德国的克虏伯工厂和美国的阿力斯坎伯尔工厂，把它们作为设计的借镜。但这两个工厂都是在资本主义时代盲目地无计划地逐步扩充起来的。这时我们还不明白太原重型机器厂是社会主义性质的工厂，它是不能脱离国民经济计划而盲目地无限制地扩展的。我们把克虏伯等工厂奉为经典，企图把它们原封不动地搬到人民的中国来。因此，在初步设计中，我们给各车间留了过大的扩充余地，准备将来把它们扩展成一个独立工厂。我们根本没有考虑到根据这样的设计建立起来的工厂，会使厂内运输不方便，会影响生产时间的缩短，会妨碍成本的降低。我们在决定产品种类和选择设备时，也不从实际出发。我们那时决定的产品，有最精密的车床，也有最粗的矿山机械；有最大的冶炼设备，也有最小的吊车。总之，应有尽有，企图把这个工厂变为一个“万能工厂”。工厂设备的选择，则是盲目地好大好多。我们把在资本主义国家的样本目录中找到的大机床设备都列出来，根本不考虑经济的合理性，也不考虑设备能力和产品产量的关系，自以为“要办大厂就得化大钱，不能显得小家气”。因此，实际生产能力超过了设计的生产能力，中锻工车间的实际生产能力（按苏联指数计算）竟超过了设计能力十多倍！
    初步设计的错误不仅仅是这些，上面所说的不过是比较突出的而已。我们应该感谢苏联专家克林姆斯基同志。一九五一年春天，他在北京审阅初步设计时，指出并修正了我们的错误，把这个工厂从原则性的错误设计中拯救出来。后来，他又到太原来和我们见面，再三告诫我们说：基本建设是百年大计，马虎不得。设计者应以对人民负责的精神做设计工作，要缜密调查，精确计算。尤其重要的是要考虑工厂的经济合理性和技术的先进性。比如，产品项目性质要类似，加工物精粗程度不能太悬殊，因为只有这样，在生产时，操作上才不会发生困难，设备才能得到充分的利用。苏联专家提出这些意见是在政务院财政经济委员会公布基本建设暂行程序之先，因此，它对太原重型机器厂设计的帮助就特别大。我们设计人员受了一、二十年资本主义的理论和技术的教育，始终没有学到的知识，苏联专家在短短的一天内就都告诉了我们，这不能不使我们万分感激。
    但是，我们和苏联专家接触的时间太短。克林姆斯基同志不久就回国了。如何把苏联专家指示的原则具体贯彻到技术设计中去，是一个很困难的问题。这决定于我们是否能以正确的态度去对待苏联专家的意见。
    我们的经验是：在那一方面能够把苏联专家的意见体会得透彻，在技术设计中便能在那一方面作出很好的成绩；反之，只要我们有一点自大，不虚心向他们学习，不反复地去体会他们的意见，就要出错误。
    我们曾经因为没有很好地领会和实行苏联专家的意见而犯过错误。我可以举出两个例子来说明。
    克林姆斯基同志临别时，再三告诫我们：在每一个设计的环节中，必须作精确的计算和周密的考虑，不能粗枝大叶，草率从事。这是实事求是的精神，是高度负责的表现。我们设计冷作车间室内空中行车时没有贯彻这种精神。我们订购的行车明明是上海通用机器厂制造的，但在设计时却按苏联制造的行车的规格计算，其实两者的规格、质量都是有差别的。我们只知机械地搬用苏联的技术定额，而忽略了这种差别。这个错误幸亏在施工时被发现临时改正了。
    苏联专家非常注意技术安全和生活福利设备。这是因为社会主义的企业不仅要求生产价廉物美的产品，并且要保证员工在安全、愉快的条件下劳动。我们这些没有经过比较彻底的思想改造、不懂得劳动人民的痛苦的人，往往会忽略了这个原则。我们设计某些车间时曾决定用木质屋面板，而这是违反安全规章和保暖条件的。又如车间内煤气管路应安置在空中才不致妨害职工健康，而我们却把它安置在地下。这些错误都是经过别人指出后才改正的。
    两年多的经验教训告诉我们：只有有了正确的设计思想，才能作出正确的设计。我们——或多或少地有着资产阶级设计思想的工程技术人员，既经决定献身于祖国伟大的经济建设，那末，就让我们坚决地改造旧的设计思想，以便完满地完成祖国赋予我们的重任。
