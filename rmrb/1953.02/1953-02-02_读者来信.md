    Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper Neglects Mass Work
    Extremely Irresponsible in Handling Readers' Letters and Contributions

    To the Editors: Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper does not pay enough attention to mass work, and is extremely irresponsible in handling letters and contributions from correspondents and readers. Chen Tongxin, the head of the editorial group, only looks for useful articles from the submissions, and those he considers not good are torn up and thrown into the wastebasket after only a quick glance. When reporter Liu Lumin goes to the countryside, he only cares about collecting materials himself or finding others to collect materials for him to write articles. Some correspondents have asked him for help with writing several times, but he ignores them, so some people call him the "sweeping reporter" (meaning that when he arrives in a certain area, no one else should think about writing articles). Cheng Maolin, the director of the newspaper's office, is busy with his own literary creations in addition to doing some work that has to be done (such as writing articles), and does not pay attention to the newspaper's mass work and readers' letters. Last autumn, the office formulated a mass work plan, but it was only "talking on paper" and was not implemented. The newspaper does not even have a system for registering submissions; after receiving submissions, they are directly handed over to the editors for processing. Many correspondents are unwilling to write anymore because their submissions to the newspaper are neither published nor do they receive a reply; some correspondents angrily wrote "letters of severing relations" to the newspaper. Therefore, the number of submissions and letters received by the newspaper is decreasing day by day.

    I believe that Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper's attitude of not paying attention to mass work, and the newspaper staff's extremely bad attitude towards correspondents and submissions, is not permissible. The newspaper should deeply and publicly examine its mistakes and earnestly correct them.
                                                                                     A Group
    To the Editors: I am a correspondent for Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper. Since July of last year, I have been writing articles, letters, and reflecting situations to Rural Mass Newspaper. I have written a total of ten articles and letters, including criticisms of the untimely supply of wheat seeds and fertilizers by cooperatives in my area, suggestions for farmers to participate in livestock insurance, praise for military dependent Wang Quxi's active cotton planting and abundant harvest, and reports on farmers in my village actively participating in cooperatives after receiving future education during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month". However, except for the letter criticizing the cooperative, which received a reply, the rest of my submissions and letters to the newspaper did not receive a reply. Sometimes I think to myself: Does Rural Mass Newspaper look down on me, a "country bumpkin"? After thinking about it, I shouldn't submit to the newspaper anymore! Of course, my discouraged attitude is also wrong. But Rural Mass Newspaper's treatment of correspondents is also wrong. I hope they will examine themselves and not do this again in the future.
                                                                                    Wang Ruisheng

    Editor's Note: Judging from the readers' reflections, the Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper's editors' lack of attention to readers' submissions and letters is very serious. The leading cadres of the newspaper's editorial department should conduct an in-depth review and submit the results of the review to this newspaper for publication.

    Eliminate Errors in Publications

    To the Editors: I suggest that newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses in various regions should further strengthen the editing, proofreading, and printing inspection of manuscripts to eliminate errors and waste. As far as I know, the phenomena of errors and waste in newspaper and book publishing in the Northwest region are quite serious. For example, when the Xi'an Mass Daily published the news of our country's selection of a delegation to participate in the World People's Peace Conference, it made a mistake in the list of representatives and recalled all the newspapers the next day. When the Shaanxi Daily commemorated "July 1st", it published a wrong article and recalled all the newspapers the next day. Other organizations, such as Northwest New Youth Daily and Northwest People's Publishing House, also had several incidents in 1952 of printing thousands or tens of thousands of copies of newspapers and books with errors. Printing newspapers and books with errors not only causes waste of national wealth, but more importantly, causes political losses. I hope that the staff of newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses in the Northwest and other regions will treat their work very seriously and eliminate this phenomenon.
                                                                                         Wu Jiming

    Newspapers and Periodicals Should Try to Annotate Specialized Terms in Economic Construction

    To the Editors: Our great motherland's large-scale economic construction has begun. Although I am not an economic worker, I, like the people of the whole country, am very concerned about the progress of the motherland's economic construction, and I am determined to study materials related to economic construction. However, when I read articles on this subject in newspapers and periodicals, I find it difficult because I do not understand many specialized terms, which affects my understanding of the content. Some comrades around me have the same feeling. For example, we do not know what the specialized terms "grid survey method" in forestry, "drilling, pit exploration, trench exploration" in geology, and "open-hearth steelmaking" in steelmaking mean. We suggest that in the future, when newspapers and magazines publish articles on economic construction, they should try to provide necessary explanations for some specialized terms to help the general readers better learn about economic construction.
                                                                                             Xia Nuo

    Hope Newspapers Publish More Cartoons

    To the Editors: Cartoons are one of the powerful tools in propaganda work. Through vivid and lively images, they give people a clear impression and profound education, and are loved by the general public. However, many newspapers do not pay enough attention to this work. They rarely publish cartoons, and therefore cannot meet the requirements of the general readers. The People's Daily criticized this on August 29th of last year. Since then, some newspapers have strengthened their cartoon work. For example, the Liberation Daily not only pays attention to reprinting better cartoons from other newspapers and magazines, but also creates many cartoons of its own. However, many newspapers, such as the Northwest Mass Daily, have made little improvement. Although the newspaper reprinted some cartoons published in other newspapers and magazines from September to December last year, it rarely had its own creations, and there were very few other single-panel drawings. Of course, the lack of talent in this area in the newspaper's editorial department also creates difficulties in the work. But this situation should also be changed by finding ways to organize more painters to participate in this work. I hope that newspapers and art workers in various regions will work closely together to create and publish more good cartoons and single-panel drawings to meet the requirements of the general readers.
                                                                                       Wu Jiming

    Employed Workers Should Not Apply for Unemployment Registration

    To the Editors: In the labor employment registration work in Sujiabu District, Liuan County, Anhui Province, due to insufficient publicity, many workers do not understand the meaning of labor employment and unemployment registration. Some small handicraft workers believe that their industry has "no future" and that "registration will allow them to go to big factories." Coupled with the "off-season" business difficulties and the enticement of some capitalists, they have voluntarily resigned and gone to the district people's government to register. In the bamboo weaving industry alone, more than twenty workers have done this. The district originally had twenty-six unemployed people, but now there are more than one hundred and ten. Although this is partly due to the capitalists' approved closures, it is mainly due to insufficient publicity on labor employment. Currently, labor employment work in many regions is transitioning from publicity to registration. The above situation should be taken as a lesson in various regions to ensure the normal progress of labor employment registration work.
                                                                          Li Zuolai, Guo Wei

                                     Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee Organizes Inspection Team
    To Inspect and Handle the Problem of Commodity Overstocking in the Beijing State-Owned Trade System

    To the Editors: After your newspaper published the article "Why Does the Beijing Company of China Department Store Corporation Have an Overstock of 45.2 Billion Yuan of Commodities" on January 24th, we immediately convened relevant departments for two meetings on the 26th and 27th to study this issue. The comrades who attended the meeting unanimously believed that this situation was very serious and must be changed immediately. At the same time, it was believed that this serious situation was common in other state-owned specialized companies. To this end, a temporary inspection team composed of fifteen cadres from Beijing Department Store Corporation, Beijing Enterprise Corporation, Beijing Daily, and other units was established to conduct a special inspection of this issue in order to overcome the supply system thinking and purely profit-seeking views in the financial and economic departments, improve the management of trade work, implement the economic accounting system, improve the quality of industrial products, reduce costs, and organize production and sales in a planned way. The results of the inspection and handling will be communicated to you soon.

    Cadres of Xinshang Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yongji County Have a Stiff Attitude and Do Not Actively Purchase Cotton from Members

    To the Editors: Last October, cotton farmers in Dongyaowen Village, Yongji County, Shanxi Province, responded to the government's call to sell cotton collectively and enthusiastically transported the cotton they produced to the Xinshang Town Market Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, several miles away from the village, by carts and shoulder poles. However, after the cotton was delivered to the cooperative, they waited a long time before it was handed over. Just as it was about to be their turn to weigh it, the cooperative's grading personnel said, "We can't buy it today because it's raining!" (Actually, they could) Despite repeated requests from the masses, the cooperative still refused to accept it. Finally, they found the secretary of the first district party committee, who spoke to the director of the cooperative, and then they accepted it. But they didn't accept much because it was getting dark and they stopped. The director of the cooperative said, "We can't finish accepting it, come back tomorrow!" The next day, the masses sent the cotton again, but the cooperative didn't accept it for some reason. At that time, the masses had many opinions on the cooperative's practice, and the director of the cooperative not only did not explain to the masses, but said rudely, "We won't accept it if we don't accept it, who has a contract with you!" This caused even more dissatisfaction among the masses. And many members asked to withdraw from the cooperative. We believe that the Xinshang Town Market Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative's practice is contrary to the cooperative's business policy of "serving the members and serving production" and should be reviewed.

    Suggest Establishing a "Document Exchange Station" for Central-Level Agencies

    To the Editors: Since the General Office of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government created the method of "Document Exchange Station" in Harbin City, many places have established them one after another. According to the experience of various regions, this can indeed speed up the circulation of official documents, improve work efficiency, and save manpower and material resources. The various units under the Central People's Government are distributed throughout Beijing. Many letters are sent by each unit every day, and they are all delivered by messengers. In this way, not only is the speed slow, but more importantly, it wastes a lot of manpower. If the method of "Document Exchange Station" is implemented, a group of personnel can definitely be saved and put into other work. We suggest establishing a "Document Exchange Station" for central-level agencies.
                                                                     Han Jiankun, Liu Chunxiang

    Editor's Note: The General Office of the State Council of the Central People's Government is working on formulating "Trial Measures for Document Exchange Stations for Central and Beijing-level Agencies". After discussing with relevant departments, it will set up stations for trial implementation.

专栏：读者来信

    山东农村大众报忽视群众工作
    处理读者来信来稿极不负责
    编辑同志：山东农村大众报对群众工作很不重视，处理通讯员和读者的来信、来稿极不负责。编辑组长陈同新只是从来稿中找好用的，那些他认为不好的稿子，只看个头就顺手撕掉，丢在废纸篓里。记者刘鲁民到农村去，只管自己收集材料或找别人替自己收集材料来写稿，有的通讯员几次请他帮助写作，他都不理不睬，因此有人称他“扫荡记者”（意思是他到了某地区，别人就不要想写稿了）。该报办公室主任程茂林除了做些不得不做的工作（如写稿），就忙于自己的文艺创作，对报社群众工作和读者来信工作不闻不问。去年秋天办公室曾制订了一个群众工作方案，但也只是“纸上谈兵”，并未实施。该报甚至连来稿登记的制度也没有，收到稿件后直接交给编辑处理。不少通讯员因为向报社投稿既不见刊用又得不到回信，就不愿再写了；有的通讯员愤怒地给报社写了“绝交书”。所以，该报收到的来稿来信日益减少。
    我认为山东农村大众报这种不重视群众工作的态度，该报工作人员以如此恶劣的态度对待通讯员和来稿、来信的做法，是不能容许的。该报应该深刻地公开地检讨自己的错误，并切实改正。
      一群
    编辑同志：我是山东农村大众报的通讯员。自从去年七月份起，我就向农村大众报写稿、写信和反映情况。我一共写了十篇稿子和信，其中有批评我区合作社供应麦种、肥料不及时的，有建议农民参加牲畜保险的，有表扬军属王去喜积极种棉花得到丰收的，有报道我村农民在“中苏友好月”中受到前途教育积极参加合作社的。可是，我寄给报社的稿件和信件，除那封批评合作社的信得到了答复以外，其余都没有收到回信。有时我心里想：莫非是农村大众报瞧不起我这个“乡下人”？想来想去，还是不要再向报社投稿吧！当然我这种灰心的态度也是不对的。但是农村大众报这样对待通讯员也是错误的，希望他们检讨，今后不要再这样做。
    王瑞声
    编者按：从读者的反映看来，山东农村大众报的编辑人员不重视读者来稿、来信的情况，是十分严重的。该报编辑部领导干部应作深入检查，并将检查结果交本报发表。消灭出版物中的差错现象
    编辑同志：我建议各地报纸、杂志和出版社应进一步加强稿件的编辑、校对和印刷检查工作，消灭差错和浪费现象。就我所知，在西北地区，报刊书籍出版方面的差错和浪费现象相当严重。例如西安群众日报在刊登我国选出代表团参加世界人民和平大会的消息时，排错了代表的名单，第二天将全部报纸收回。陕西日报在纪念“七一”时，刊错了一篇文章，第二天将全部报纸收回。其他如西北新青年报、西北人民出版社等，在一九五二年都曾发生几次将报纸和书籍印错数千份至数万份的事情。报刊书籍印错了，不仅造成国家财富的浪费，更重要的是造成政治上的损失。希望西北及其他各地报社、杂志社、出版社的工作人员，十分严肃地对待自己的工作，杜绝这种现象。  吴纪明
    报纸刊物应尽量对经济建设方面的专用名词加以注释
    编辑同志：我们伟大祖国大规模的经济建设已经开始。我虽然不是经济工作者，我也和全国人民一样，十分关心祖国经济建设的情况，并且有决心学习有关经济建设的材料。但我在阅读报刊上关于这方面的文章时，感到有一个困难，就是许多专用名词看不懂，因而影响了对内容的理解。我周围的一些同志，也有同样的感觉。例如报刊上报道林业方面的“方格调查法”，地质方面的“钻探、坑探、槽探”，炼钢方面的“平炉炼钢”等等，我们都不知道这些专用名词是什么意思。我们建议：今后报纸杂志在刊载有关经济建设的文章时，对于一些专用名词，应尽量作必要的解释，以帮助广大读者更好地学习经济建设。  夏  诺
    希望报纸刊登更多的漫画
    编辑同志：漫画是宣传工作中的有力工具之一。它通过生动活泼的形象，给人以鲜明的印象和深刻的教育，为广大群众所喜爱。可是有不少报纸对这一工作还重视不够，它们很少刊登漫画，因而不能满足广大读者的要求。对此，人民日报曾在去年八月二十九日提出过批评。此后，有些报纸加强了漫画工作。例如解放日报，不仅注意转载其它报刊杂志上的较好的漫画，自己也创作了不少漫画。但是有不少报纸如西北群众日报等就很少有改进。该报从去年九月至十二月，虽然转载了一些其它报刊上发表的漫画，但很少有自己创作的漫画，其它独幅画也极少。当然报纸编辑部缺乏这方面的人材，也造成工作中的困难。但这种情况也应该设法加以改变，多组织一些画家来参加这一工作。我希望各地报纸和美术工作者密切合作，更多地创作和发表一些好的漫画及独幅画，以满足广大读者的要求。吴纪明
    在业工人不应该去请求失业登记
    编辑同志：安徽省六安县苏家埠区在进行劳动就业登记工作中，由于宣传工作做得不够，许多工人不了解劳动就业和失业登记的意义。某些小手工业工人认为本行“无前途”，“登记了就可以到大工厂去”，加上“淡季”营业困难和某些资方的利诱，纷纷自动辞退，到区人民政府去登记。仅篾业中，就有二十多个工人这样作了。该区原有二十六个失业人员，现在增加到一百十人以上。这当中固然有资方报准歇业的原因，但主要是对劳动就业的宣传不够。目前，许多地区的劳动就业工作，正由宣传转入登记阶段。对上述情况，各地应该引为教训，以保证劳动就业登记工作的正常进行。李作来  郭  威
                         北京市财经委员会组织检查组
    检查处理北京市国营贸易系统的商品积压问题
    编辑同志：你报在一月二十四日刊载了“中国百货公司北京市公司为什么积压了四百五十二亿的商品”的文章，我们即于二十六日、二十七日召集有关部门开会两次，对此问题进行了研究。到会同志一致认为这种情况十分严重，必须立即加以改变。同时认为这种严重情况在其他国营专业公司也普遍存在。为此，特由北京市百货公司、北京市企业公司、北京日报等单位十五个干部成立临时检查组，对此问题专门进行检查，以便克服财经部门中的供给制思想和单纯营利观点，改善贸易工作的经营管理，贯彻经济核算制，提高工业产品的质量，降低成本，有计划地组织产销。不久即将检查处理结果告诉你们。
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会
    永济县新盛镇供销社干部态度生硬不积极收购社员棉花
    编辑同志：去年十月份，我们山西省永济县东姚温村棉农响应政府集体售棉的号召，踊跃地用大车、肩挑把自己生产的棉花送到离村几里路的新盛镇集镇供销合作社去。但棉花送到合作社后，等了很久还没交上。眼看快要轮到自己过秤了，该社分级人员却说：“今天下雨不能收购啦！”（实际上能收）虽经群众再三要求，该社还是不收。最后找到一区区委书记那里，区委书记给该社段主任说了才收购。但收的不多，因天暗了又停下来。该社主任说：“收不完了，明天再来吧！”到第二天，群众又把棉花送去，但该社不知为啥又不收购了。当时，群众对合作社这种作法意见纷纷，而该社段主任不但没给群众解释，反横蛮地说：“不收就不收，谁还和你订下合同哩！”这样，更引起群众不满。并有很多社员要求退社。我们认为新盛镇集镇供销合作社这种作法，是违背合作社“为社员服务，为生产服务”的经营方针的，应作检讨。  李  琦  米忠兴  姬昌来
    建议中央一级机关建立“公文交换站”
    编辑同志：自从松江省人民政府办公厅在哈尔滨市创造了“公文交换站”的办法以后，很多地方也先后建立了。根据各地经验，这确实可以加速公文运转、提高工作效率、节省人力物力。中央人民政府所属各单位，分布在北京各地。每天各单位所发的信件很多，而且都是派通信员递送。这样，不但速度慢，更重要的是浪费了不少人力。如果实行“公文交换站”的办法，必定可以节省下一批人员，投入其他工作中去。我们建议中央一级机关建立“公文交换站”。  韩剑昆
                                             刘春香
    编者按：中央人民政府政务院秘书厅正着手研究制定“中央及北京市一级各机关公文交换站试行办法”，等和有关部门商讨后，即可设站试行。
