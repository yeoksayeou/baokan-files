State-Owned Factories 121 and 122
Neglect Basic Construction Material Storage, Wasting State Investment
State-owned factories 121 and 122 have neglected the storage of basic construction materials, causing serious losses to state investment.

In early December of last year, the China Changchun Railway Bureau decided to expedite the transportation of materials in order to complete the state transportation tasks ahead of schedule. The bureau notified factories 121 and 122 of this plan in advance. However, the leading cadres of these two factories did not pay any attention to this new situation and made no preparations. The cadres below, fearing punishment for delaying the unloading time, blindly ordered the workers to rush unloading as soon as the trains carrying materials arrived, regardless of the quantity of materials delivered, the quality, registration, or acceptance, or the extent to which the stacking method would damage the materials. They only cared about unloading quickly. Stacking stones on bricks and then placing wood on top resulted in the crushing of many bricks. Some stacked the bricks lengthwise, making them easy to break. Some bricks were not stacked evenly, some placed on stones, some on wood, and the stacking was not neat, so they would collapse with the slightest vibration. Some materials should have been unloaded closer to the warehouse for easy handling, but they unloaded them far away without any planning. Originally, there were materials that had been stockpiled for more than half a year on the railway siding lines of these two factories and had not been transported away. Materials were piled up everywhere along the eight- or nine-mile-long siding line, with broken bricks and debris scattered all over the ground. The situation became even more chaotic after the blind rush unloading.

The work of moving materials was even more chaotic than unloading. Workers moved whatever they wanted to move first, and moved it however they wanted, with no one paying attention. Some of the movers came from the countryside and lacked knowledge of moving. These two factories usually provided very poor education to the movers and failed to instill in them the concept of cherishing state property. In addition, because wages were calculated by the piece, some movers moved materials to the nearest location. Some workers moved the materials on top and left the whole pieces and scattered materials underneath mixed together; some workers picked materials to move from a large pile, and when the materials below and in the middle were removed, the bricks on top would fall and break. Due to the long-term lack of responsibility for material storage in these two factories, preliminary statistics show that factory 121 lost 1.4 million red bricks, and factory 122 lost 490,000 red bricks. Including the extra loss of other materials, the total loss of state investment was nearly 1 billion yuan.

The loss of materials in factories 121 and 122 this time was completely avoidable. The China Changchun Railway Bureau's expedited transportation plan had been notified to these two factories in advance, and these two factories had ample time to make preparations. Factory 122 had 150 large carts and more than 200 movers; factory 121 had more than 300 large carts and more than 100 movers. The responsible cadres of these two factories should have paid attention to this work in a timely manner, organized cadres and workers, established a responsibility system, educated workers to foster the concept of cherishing state property, and at the same time, they could have inquired about the transportation of materials from the railway bureau every day and made plans in advance to carry out the work in a planned manner. However, the factory directors, deputy directors, and party committee secretaries of factories 121 and 122 completely ignored such a major issue. Originally, neither factory had anyone specifically responsible for basic construction work. The material storage work was concurrently managed by a deputy director of both factories, but in reality, this deputy director had no time to take care of the basic construction material storage work. The deputy director in charge of supply at factory 121 was in Beijing making plans during this tense period. At this time, the main responsible cadres of these two factories did not take effective measures to strengthen the leadership of basic construction. The lower-level cadres of these two factories had long reflected this chaotic situation, but the responsible cadres did not try to correct it. Even the factory directors and deputy directors passed by the railway siding every day and saw the waste and accumulation of materials, but they remained indifferent. The deputy secretary of the party committee of the Chinese Communist Party at factory 122 admitted in his self-criticism that he knew about this situation at the time but thought it was an administrative matter and did not care.

On December 18, Comrade Wang Naiji of the Business Office of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau exposed the fact of wasting state property in the Northeast Daily. The responsible cadres of factory 121 still did not pay attention to this matter. It was not until the higher authorities sent people to inspect the work in these two factories that the responsible cadres shifted the responsibility to objective reasons, believing that the China Changchun Railway Bureau should not have expedited the transportation of materials. After repeated criticism from the higher authorities, the responsible cadres of these two factories examined their serious bureaucratic style and began to improve the material storage work.

    国营一二一厂和一二二厂
    忽视基本建设材料保管工作浪费国家投资
    国营一二一厂和一二二厂忽视基本建设材料的保管工作，使国家投资受到严重损失。
    去年十二月初，中国长春铁路管理局为了提前完成国家运输任务，决定赶运物资。该管理局事先将这个计划通知了一二一厂和一二二厂。但是这两个厂的领导干部对这种新情况没有加以任何注意，丝毫未作准备工作。下面的干部怕拖延卸车时间而受罚，只要运材料的火车一到，就盲目地命令工人抢卸，不管材料运到了多少，质量好不好，不登记，也不验收，也不管堆放的方法对材料损失有多大。他们只要怎样卸得快就怎样做。石子上堆砖，砖上又放木材，结果把许多砖都压坏了；有的把砖一顺着摆，很容易把砖摔碎；有些砖摆得不平，有的放在石头上，有的放在木头上，上面又堆得不整齐，稍一震动，就要震倒。有些材料应该卸得离仓库近些，便于搬运，但是，他们却毫无计划地把这些材料卸得很远。原来铁路专用线上就有这两个厂积压了半年以上的材料没有运走。八、九里路长的专用线上到处堆放着材料，满地抛散着碎砖碎料。盲目抢卸后，情况就更加混乱。
    搬运材料的工作比卸材料的工作还乱。工人想要先搬什么就搬什么，要怎样搬就怎样搬，根本无人过问。搬运工人有些是从农村来的，缺乏搬运知识。这两个厂平时对搬运工人教育极差，没有使他们树立起爱护国家财产的观念。加上又是按件计算搬运工资，所以有些搬运工人觉得那里近就往那里搬。有些工人把上面材料搬走了，下面还有整件的材料和零碎材料混在一起，就不管了；有些工人从一大堆材料中间挑材料搬，等到下面和中间的材料抽空了，上面的砖就一起倒下来摔碎了。由于这两个厂长期无人负责材料保管工作，据初步的统计，一二一厂损失红砖一百四十万块，一二二厂损失红砖四十九万块，加上其他材料的额外耗损，共损失国家投资近十亿元。
    一二一厂和一二二厂这次材料的损失，是完全可以避免的。中国长春铁路管理局的赶运计划事先已通知了这两个厂，这两个厂完全有时间预先作好准备工作。一二二厂有一百五十辆大车，有二百多个搬运工人；一二一厂有三百多辆大车，也有一百多个搬运工人。这两个厂的负责干部本来应该及时重视这个工作，把干部和工人组织起来，建立责任制，教育工人树立爱护国家财产的观念，同时每天还可以向铁路局调查运输材料的情况，事先做出计划，以便有计划地进行工作。但是，一二一厂和一二二厂的厂长、副厂长、党委书记对于这样重大的问题，根本是听若无闻，视若未见。原来这两个厂就没有专人负责基本建设工作。材料保管工作，这两厂只有一个副厂长兼管，实际上这个副厂长根本无暇顾及基本建设材料保管工作。一二一厂的供应副厂长在这个紧张的时候，正在北京做计划。这时候，这两个厂的主要负责干部也没有采取有效措施，加强对基本建设的领导。这两个厂的下级干部早已反映过这种混乱情况，负责干部也根本不去设法纠正。甚至，厂长、副厂长每天经过专用线，看见材料浪费和堆积的情况，也无动于中。中共一二二厂的党委副书记在事后检讨说：当时知道这种情况，认为是行政方面的事情，自己便不关心。
    十二月十八日，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局商务处王乃积同志在东北日报上揭露这种浪费国家资财的事实以后，一二一厂负责干部仍然没有重视这件事情。直至上级派人到这两个厂检查工作时，负责干部仍把责任推之于客观原因，认为中国长春铁路管理局不该赶运材料。经过上级一再批评，这两个厂的负责干部才检查自己的严重的官僚主义作风，开始改进材料保管工作。
