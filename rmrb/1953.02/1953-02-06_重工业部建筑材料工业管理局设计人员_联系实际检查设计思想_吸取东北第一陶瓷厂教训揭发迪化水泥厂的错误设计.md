    (From Our Own Correspondent) Over one hundred engineering and technical personnel from the Design Department of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry held a forum from January 22nd to 24th. Through analyzing and criticizing the errors in the design of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory, and in connection with the design work of their own unit, they initially launched criticism and self-criticism, exposing the errors in the design of the Dihua Cement Plant and the roots of these errors. Through this study, the design personnel's design ideology was raised a step, and internal unity was strengthened.
    This department has only recently been enriched and improved. The original foundation was weak, most of the technical personnel had not undergone ideological transformation, and they were not united. Many of the newly assigned personnel lacked factory design experience, and in particular, their understanding of design work was unclear and not unified. Before the forum, the department's personnel had studied some documents, but the connection with the work was insufficient. Some people were still apprehensive, unwilling to expose themselves or criticize others.
    After this newspaper published the editorial "Design Work Must Be Correctly Carried Out" and the news "The Design Errors of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory Resulted in Great Waste," the leaders of the bureau decided to organize a study in the design department to improve the design ideology of the personnel. At the forum, Chen Yuntao, Director of the Bureau, and Yang Sijiu, Deputy Director, made self-criticisms, admitting that in the past, because they emphasized that they did not understand design work, they did not study it carefully enough, lacked specific leadership, and relaxed inspection, which caused great losses to the work. On the first day of the forum, everyone analyzed and criticized the design errors of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory. The technical personnel who participated in the forum began to clearly recognize that design work must be combined with politics, economy, and technology. On the afternoon of the second and third days, in connection with the problems in the department's design work, group discussions and general discussions were held one after another. Many people examined their own shortcomings, such as conservative thinking, fear of responsibility, and emphasis on personal interests, and focused on exposing the errors in the design of the Dihua Cement Plant.
    The nature of the errors in the design of the Dihua Cement Plant was similar to those of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory in many aspects. First, design began before the raw materials were determined, and construction began before the design was completed. The entire design lacked precise calculations and a general design. The decision on the factory site was very hasty. It was separated from the raw material production area by a river, requiring the construction of an additional bridge and extending the transportation line, resulting in great waste. When designing the factory kiln, the needs of production were not calculated; it was only enlarged by twenty meters based on the standard of the kiln at the Liulihe Cement Plant. However, when designing the coal mill, it was adapted to the materials, and its length was shortened compared to the mill at the Liulihe Cement Plant, resulting in an imbalance in production, with a large kiln and a small mill.
    Second, there was a simple pursuit of formal beauty, without implementing the concept of economic accounting. For example, a new-style large warehouse was designed, with the raw material, fuel, and finished product storage rooms arranged in a row, using cranes for transportation. However, the location where the clinker was produced from the kiln was far from the storage rooms, causing transportation difficulties and great waste. When deciding to install motors, the load factor was not calculated, and even now, the total power consumption of the factory is unknown.
    Third, the design personnel were careless, causing many errors. For example, the three words "hand-operated" were omitted from the crane drawing, resulting in the purchase of electric ones that could not be used at all, wasting 500 million yuan of national investment. When designing the coal hoist, the maximum load only required a 1 kW motor, but a 6.4 kW motor was mistakenly used. Another raw material hoist required a 4.1 kW motor for the maximum load, but only a 4 kW motor was used. The above errors have only now been verified, but the motors have already been purchased, causing considerable losses.
    Fourth, the safety and welfare of workers were neglected. Little attention was paid to the workers' labor conditions during the design process. Protective covers were not added to the machines. This only attracted attention during this study, and it was decided to add designs related to labor protection in the detailed construction drawings.
    In the process of exposing the errors in the design of the Dihua Cement Plant, the design personnel broke through ideological barriers and launched criticism and self-criticism. Engineer Zhang Daye was the main person in charge of the design of the Dihua Cement Plant. Originally, he had many concerns, felt that the study was a burden, and was not very interested in it. After criticizing the design errors of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory and the Dihua Cement Plant, Zhang Daye realized the necessity of launching criticism and self-criticism and began to seriously examine himself. He said: "The reason why so many errors occurred in this design is primarily due to a serious detachment from politics. For example, the factory site was separated from the raw materials by a river, and I also thought it was unreasonable, but I did not insist on raising my opinion to the factory. At that time, I thought that I was doing technical work, and they could put it wherever they wanted, and the responsibility was not mine. Secondly, there was the idea of 'you get what you pay for,' without considering whether it was economically reasonable. For example, when determining the kiln's output, future development was not considered, and the production target was set according to the standard of Liulihe. Later, the quota was repeatedly increased, and the mill's reserve capacity was insufficient. Third, I wanted to show off my skills and did not want others to interfere too much. Therefore, others were passive, there was no contact with each other, which affected internal unity and caused great losses to the work." Why was the remnant poison of old ideas so deep? He said, "In the past, we talked about the importance of politics, but we did not seriously implement it into our actual work; learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union also only stayed on the level of talk, without concrete implementation. There was a lack of a spirit of practice." Therefore, he believes that "we can no longer be the same as before, and we should fully understand the country's policies; otherwise, the design work will lose its direction and cause losses to the country." Engineer Zhu Zupei had many opinions on the design of the Dihua Cement Plant in the past, but he was unwilling to raise them, first because he was afraid of affecting unity, and second because he was afraid that if he participated, he would also be responsible if something went wrong. This time, he criticized Zhang Daye and the leadership and also examined his own errors. After the meeting, Zhang Daye took the initiative to talk to Zhu Zupei, eliminating their differences.
    After the forum, engineers began to take the initiative to help technicians with their work, and technicians also humbly studied and actively offered opinions on the work. For example, the day after the forum, Feng Yinghui criticized the use of high-voltage lines and cement poles at the Dihua Cement Plant. After everyone's research, it was believed that after the factory started production, there would be a lot of dust, and if high-voltage lines were used, they would need to be cleaned frequently and would be prone to failure, so it was decided to change to underground cables. In addition, the leading comrades of the department also believed that this forum was equivalent to mobilizing the masses to check the work. With better communication between superiors and subordinates, the future work would be easier.

    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局设计人员
    联系实际检查设计思想
    吸取东北第一陶瓷厂教训揭发迪化水泥厂的错误设计
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部建筑材料工业管理局设计处工程技术人员一百余人，于一月二十二日至二十四日举行座谈会，通过对东北第一陶瓷厂设计中的错误的分析与批判，联系本单位的设计工作，初步展开了批评与自我批评，揭发了该处在迪化水泥厂设计中的错误与错误的根源。经过这次学习，该处工作人员在设计思想上提高了一步，并加强了内部的团结。
    该处是最近才充实和健全起来的，原来的基础很薄弱，技术人员多未经过思想改造，并且互不团结。新调配的人员大都没有工厂设计经验，特别是对于设计工作的认识不明确、不统一。在座谈会之前，该处工作人员曾学习了一些文件，但与工作联系不够。有的人还有顾虑，不愿暴露自己，也不肯批评别人。
    本报发表“必须正确地进行设计工作”的社论和
    “东北第一陶瓷厂设计错误浪费很大”的消息以后，该局领导方面决定在设计处组织一次学习，以提高工作人员的设计思想。座谈会上，该局局长陈云涛、副局长杨思九进行了自我批评，承认过去因强调不懂设计工作，没有很好钻研，缺乏具体领导，放松检查，致使工作遭受很大损失；座谈会第一天，大家对东北第一陶瓷厂设计的错误进行了分析和批判。参加座谈会的技术人员，开始明确认识了设计工作必须和政治、经济与技术相结合。第二天、第三天下午，联系该处设计工作中的问题，接连进行了小组漫谈和大会讨论。很多人检讨了自己的保守思想、怕负责任、强调个人兴趣等缺点，并着重地揭发了该处在迪化水泥厂设计中的错误。
    迪化水泥厂设计中的错误性质，很多地方与东北第一陶瓷厂的相同。第一、原料未确定就开始设计，设计未完就开始施工；整个设计中缺乏精确计算，没有总体设计。对于厂址的决定是很草率的，与原料出产地隔了一条河，必须多造一座桥，延长了运输线，造成很大浪费。设计厂窑时，没有计算生产的需要，只是根据琉璃河水泥厂的窑的标准加大二十公尺；而设计煤磨时又迁就材料，比琉璃河水泥厂的磨的长度减短了，结果窑大磨子小，造成了生产上的不平衡。
    第二、单纯追求形式美观，没有贯彻经济核算观点，如设计了一个新式的大仓库，把原料、燃料和成品的储藏间排成一列，用吊车运输。但窑出熟料的地点与储藏间相差很远，造成运输上的困难，浪费很大。决定装马达时，不计算负荷率，甚至到现在还不知道全厂用电量是多少。
    第三、设计人员粗枝大叶，造成不少错误。如在吊车图上少写了“手摇式”三个字，结果买回来的都是电动式的，根本不能用，浪费国家投资五亿元。在设计煤的提升机时，本来最大负荷只要一瓩的马达，但错误地采用了六点四瓩的马达。另外一个生料提升机最大负荷要四点一瓩的马达，但只采用了四瓩的马达。以上错误现在才核对出来，但马达已经买来了，造成不小的损失。
    第四、忽视工人安全福利。在设计过程中很少注意工人的劳动条件。机器上也不加防护罩。在这次学习中才引起重视，决定在施工详图里补做有关劳动保护的设计。
    该处设计人员在揭发迪化水泥厂设计中的错误过程中，突破了思想上的障碍，展开了批评与自我批评。工程师张大埜是设计迪化水泥厂的主要负责人，原来有很多顾虑，觉得学习是包袱，对这次学习很没有兴趣。经过对东北第一陶瓷厂和迪化水泥厂设计错误的批判，张大埜体会了展开批评与自我批评的必要，开始认真地进行了检讨。他说：“这个设计所以发生很多错误，首先是由于严重地脱离了政治。如厂址与原料隔一条河，自己也认为不合理，但没有坚持向厂方提出意见。当时想自己做的是技术工作，他们愿意放那里就放那里，责任不在我。其次是存在着‘给多少钱办多少事’的思想，不考虑经济上是否合理。如在确定窑的产量时就没有考虑将来的发展，只按照琉璃河的标准规定了生产指标。后来定额一再提高，磨子储备能力就不够用了。第三是自己要显一手，不愿别人多管。因此旁人就陷于被动，互不联系，影响了内部的团结，使工作遭受很大的损失。”为什么旧思想的遗毒这样深呢？他说：“过去口口声声说政治重要，但并未认真贯彻到实际工作中去；学习苏联先进经验也只停留在口头上，没有具体进行。缺乏实践的精神。”因此，他认为“再不能和以前一样了，应该充分了解国家的政策；否则设计工作就会迷失方向，给国家造成损失”。工程师朱祖培过去对迪化水泥厂的设计有不少意见，但是不愿意提，一来怕影响团结，二来怕自己参加进去，万一发生问题自己也要负责任。这次他对张大埜以及领导上提出了批评，也检讨了自己的错误。会后，张大埜主动地和朱祖培谈话，消除了彼此的隔阂。
    座谈会开过以后，工程师开始主动地去帮助技术员工作，技术员也虚心地进行学习，并积极地对工作提出意见。如座谈会后的第二天，冯映辉就对迪化水泥厂采用高压线和洋灰杆子提出了批评。经大家研究，认为工厂开始生产以后，灰尘很多，如采用高压线需要常常清洗，且容易发生故障，故决定改用地线。此外，该处领导同志也认为这次座谈会等于发动群众检查了一次工作，上下通了气，以后的工作就比较好做了。
