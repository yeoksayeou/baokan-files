Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: Remarkable achievements have been made in preferential treatment work across the country. With the enthusiastic care of governments at all levels and the people, the lives of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers have greatly improved throughout the country. Respecting and assisting families of martyrs and military personnel has become a new moral concept among the people.

The preferential treatment of substitute farming work in rural areas has greatly improved over the past year. The substitute farming work in various regions is generally carried out in conjunction with the patriotic production increase movement. The output of substitute farming land has mostly reached the output level of general farmland. The method of fixed substitute farming has also seen new developments. In Shandong Province, fixed substitute farming accounts for 85 percent of the total substitute farming land, while in Zhejiang Province, it accounts for 60 percent. In many areas of Northeast, North, and Northwest China, a new method of fixed substitute farming has been adopted, in which agricultural production mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives combine to provide substitute farming: for families of martyrs and military personnel who have no labor force, the mutual aid team or cooperative contracts to farm the land that should be substituted, and delivers the grain in the autumn; for those who have a labor force, in addition to providing substitute farming for the land that should be substituted, the laborer is also absorbed to participate in labor, with work points recorded. In the Northeast region, 60 percent of substitute farming land is now farmed by production mutual aid teams. In the late-liberated areas such as Southwest and Central South China, the "labor allocation system" has gradually been transformed into fixed substitute farming. Last year, most counties and cities in western Sichuan Province conducted key experiments in fixed substitute farming. Peasants in various regions are generally very serious when providing substitute farming, and many have incorporated doing a good job in substitute farming into their patriotic production increase plans. In many areas, farmers have also conducted substitute farming competitions, and regularly check the substitute farming work through "Patriotic Days" or "Preferential Treatment Days." In Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, 204 out of 212 villages launched substitute farming work competitions last year; in Wuxiang County, more than 70 percent of the villages established a monthly "Preferential Treatment Day" system for inspection and evaluation. The adoption of fixed substitute farming, contract farming and production, and evaluation and competition methods has basically guaranteed the grain yield of substitute farming land. The average yield of substitute farming land in various regions in 1952 increased significantly compared to 1951. Some areas have also achieved bumper harvests. According to statistics from Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, the average yield of substitute farming land increased by 10 to 30 percent compared to 1951. The substitute farming land in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, achieved an all-round bumper harvest last year, with an average actual yield of 264 jin per mu on more than 30,000 mu of substitute farming land; among them, 549 mu achieved high-yield bumper harvests, with an average actual yield of 556 jin per mu. In 41 villages in Xingtang and Fangshan counties, Hebei Province, among the 1,714 mu of land enjoying substitute farming by 393 households of families of martyrs and military personnel, 304 mu had higher yields than general farmland, accounting for 17.8 percent; 1,315 mu had yields equivalent to general farmland, accounting for 76.7 percent; and 95 mu had yields lower than general farmland, accounting for only 5.5 percent. With the increase in yield, the living standards of families of martyrs and military personnel have generally risen. In Xujiawa Township, Yishui County, Shandong Province, 129 households of families of martyrs and military personnel had only one head of draft animal in 1949, but now have 20 heads of livestock; before 1949, only one household raised pigs, but now 25 households raise pigs.

In cities, the employment problems of families of martyrs and military personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers have been largely resolved. In the entire North China region, the vast majority of families of martyrs and military personnel residing in towns and cities have found employment with the help of the people's government. For example, the Tianjin and Beijing Municipal People's Governments have introduced nearly 20,000 families of martyrs and military personnel to work in various factories and government agencies. Last year, Wuhan City introduced 4,822 families of martyrs and military personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers to participate in various jobs, and the employment problem of families of martyrs and military personnel in the city has been basically resolved. Other cities such as Chongqing and Hangzhou have also basically solved the living and production problems of families of martyrs and military personnel throughout the city. Various production organizations have been established in many cities to absorb large numbers of families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in work. According to statistics from Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and other cities, 128 knitting, dyeing, handicraft and other factories have been organized, absorbing 4,633 families of martyrs and military personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers to participate in production; Chongqing City has organized more than 60 production organizations for families of martyrs and military personnel, and the cloth shoes, casings and other products produced are purchased by state-owned enterprises, and the families of martyrs and military personnel participating in production can earn an average of more than 400,000 yuan per person per month. Small towns have also allocated funds from the government to subsidize families of martyrs and military personnel to engage in sideline production according to the different conditions of each place.

For the elderly, weak, disabled, sick, and those who are temporarily unable to find employment and are poor, as well as those who lack production funds among families of martyrs and military personnel, the people's government provides material assistance or loans. Last year, the Northwest region issued more than 58 billion yuan in various preferential treatment funds and subsidies; Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tianjin issued a total of 7.45 billion yuan. According to inspections in ten large and medium-sized cities and 28 counties in the Northeast region: the difficulties of families of martyrs and military personnel in rural areas in lacking means of production and sideline production funds have been basically overcome. For example, 14 households of families of martyrs and military personnel in Damiaogou Village, Qinglong County, Rehe Province, received a total of 6 million yuan in subsidies and bought three donkeys, six cows, and thirteen sheep.

The vast majority of children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers have been enrolled in schools. More than 95 percent of the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in Shanghai have been enrolled in schools, and 10,080 of them have received preferential treatment in the form of scholarships or tuition reductions. In order to do a good job in enrolling children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, the Education Bureau of Tianjin Municipal People's Government has stipulated a "contract" method, in which all those who volunteer to enroll are assisted in enrolling, and some of them receive preferential treatment in the form of scholarships or tuition reductions. The revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in East China have promoted the rapid literacy method, which has basically eliminated illiteracy. Some revolutionary disabled soldiers have completed the elementary school stage and begun to enter junior high school.

Under the education of patriotism, the people in various places have great respect for families of martyrs and military personnel and revolutionary disabled soldiers. The political status of families of martyrs and military personnel and revolutionary disabled soldiers has been greatly improved. In the Subei area, more than 1,300 families of martyrs and military personnel and revolutionary disabled soldiers have been elected as representatives to the people's congresses at the county and city levels. In 31 cities and counties including Shenyang and Fushun in Northeast China, more than 11,000 families of martyrs and military personnel have been elected or appointed as members of people's governments at all levels and administrative responsible cadres.

Although the preferential treatment work in 1952 has achieved great success, there are still shortcomings. There are still temporary labor dispatch phenomena in the substitute farming work in rural areas across the country; the yield of a small number of substitute farming land is still lower than the level of general farmland. The employment problems of families of martyrs and military personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized soldiers in cities have not been fully resolved, and the lives of some families of martyrs and military personnel are relatively difficult. In 1953, with the efforts of people's governments at all levels and the people across the country, the lives of families of martyrs and military personnel will be further improved and raised.

    全国各地优抚工作成绩显著
    烈属、军属的生活有了很大改善
    【新华社十一日讯】全国各地优抚工作成绩显著。在各级人民政府和人民群众的热情关怀下，全国各地革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的生活有了很大改善。敬爱和帮助烈属、军属已成为人们新的道德观念。
    农村中的优抚代耕工作一年来有很大改进。各地的代耕工作一般都和爱国丰产运动结合起来进行。代耕地的产量大部分达到了一般耕地的产量水平。固定代耕的方法也有了新的发展。山东省固定代耕的占代耕地总数的百分之八十五，浙江省固定代耕的占百分之六十。东北、华北和西北有不少地区采用了由农业生产互助组和农业生产合作社结合代耕的新的固定代耕的方法：烈属、军属无劳动力的，由互助组或合作社将应代耕的土地包下来，秋后交粮；有劳动力的，除应代耕的土地予以代耕外，并吸收劳动者本人参加劳动，评工记分。东北区现在有百分之六十代耕地由生产互助组代耕。西南、中南等晚解放区，已逐渐由“拨工制”转化为固定代耕，去年四川西部地区大部分县市都进行了固定代耕的重点试验。各地农民群众在代耕时，一般都很认真，有不少人把做好代耕工作订入自己的爱国丰产计划中。还有不少地区的农民进行了代耕竞赛，并通过“爱国日”或“优抚日”经常检查代耕工作。山西省晋城县二百一十二个村中，有二百零四个村去年展开了代耕工作竞赛；武乡县有百分之七十以上的村建立了一月一次的“优抚日”制度，进行检查和评比。各地采用了固定代耕、包耕包产以及评比、竞赛等办法，基本上保证了代耕田的粮食产量。一九五二年各地代耕田的平均产量比一九五一年有显著的增加。有些地区还获得了丰产。据山东、安徽、浙江和江西等省的材料统计，代耕田的产量平均比一九五一年增加一到三成。山西武乡县的代耕地去年达到全面丰收，全县三万多亩代耕地平均每亩实产二百六十四斤；其中并有五百四十九亩获得高额丰产，平均每亩实产五百五十六斤。在河北省行唐、房山两县四十一个村三百九十三户烈属、军属享受代耕的一千七百一十四亩土地中，高于一般耕地产量的有三百零四亩，占百分之十七点八；相当于一般耕地产量的有一千三百一十五亩，占百分之七十六点七；低于一般耕地产量的九十五亩，仅占百分之五点五。随着产量的提高，烈属、军属的生活水平普遍上升。山东省沂水县徐家洼乡一百二十九户烈属、军属在一九四九年只有一头耕畜，现在有二十头牲畜；一九四九年前只有一户养猪，现在有二十五户养猪。
    在城市中，烈属、军属和革命残废军人的就业问题，大部分已得到解决。华北全区居住在城镇的烈属、军属，在人民政府的帮助下绝大部分已找到了职业，如天津、北京两市人民政府曾介绍烈属、军属到各工厂、机关工作的近两万人。武汉市去年介绍了四千八百二十二名烈属、军属和革命残废军人参加各项工作，全市的烈属、军属的就业问题基本已得到解决。其他如重庆、杭州等市也都基本上解决了全市烈属、军属的生活和生产问题。在不少城市中都举办了各种生产机构，大量吸收烈属、军属参加工作。据上海、南京、青岛、徐州、杭州、扬州等城市的统计，已组织了针织、染织、手工业等工厂一百二十八处，吸收烈属、军属和革命残废军人四千六百三十三人参加生产；重庆市组织了六十多个烈属、军属生产机构，生产的布鞋、肠衣等产品，由公营企业部门收购，参加生产的烈属、军属平均每人每月可收入四十多万元。各小城镇也都根据各地不同的条件，由政府拨款资助烈属、军属进行副业生产。
    对于烈属、军属中老、弱、残、疾和暂时不能就业而又生活贫苦以及无生产资金的，人民政府则进行实物补助或贷款。西北区去年曾发放了各种优待金和补助金五百八十多亿元；上海、武汉和天津三市共发放七十四亿五千多万元。据东北区十个大、中城市和二十八个县的检查：在农村中基本上克服了烈属、军属的生产资料和副业生产资金不足的困难。如热河省青龙县大庙沟村十四户有困难的烈属、军属共得到补助费六百万元，买了三头驴、六条牛和十三只羊。
    各地革命烈士、革命军人的子女，极大部分都已入学。上海百分之九十五以上的革命烈士、革命军人的子女已入学，其中有一万零八十人得到助学金或减免学费的优待。天津市人民政府教育局为了做好革命烈士、革命军人的子女入学的工作，规定了“包干”办法，凡志愿入学者，都设法介绍入学，并有一部分人得到助学金或减免学费的优待。华东各地的革命残废军人学校推行了速成识字法，已基本上消除了文盲，一部分革命残废军人已结束了高小学习阶段，开始进入初中学习。
    各地人民群众在爱国主义的教育下，对烈属、军属和革命残废军人都十分敬爱。烈属、军属和革命残废军人的政治地位大大提高。苏北地区烈属、军属和革命残废军人被选为县、市各界人民代表会议代表的有一千三百余人。东北沈阳、抚顺等三十一个市、县中烈属、军属被选或被任为各级人民政府委员和行政负责干部的，有一万一千多人。
    一九五二年的优抚工作虽然取得很大成绩，但仍存在着缺点。全国农村中的代耕工作还有临时派工的现象；有少数代耕地的产量还低于一般耕地的水平。城市中烈属、军属和革命残废军人、转业军人的就业问题，还没有全部得到解决，有部分烈属、军属的生活比较困难。一九五三年，在全国各级人民政府和人民群众的努力下，烈属、军属的生活将会进一步得到改善和提高。
