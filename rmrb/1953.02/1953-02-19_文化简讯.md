Liaodong Province Film Education Work Team Establishes Enterprise Management Principles

The first Liaodong Province Film Education Work Team Leaders Joint Conference, held from January 26 to 30, was quite fruitful. After discussion, everyone clearly recognized the working policy of the Film Education Work Team: to penetrate universally and deeply into areas without cinemas, to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, to do a good job in explaining the content of films, and to use slideshows, lectures, picture exhibitions, and other forms to carry out policy and current affairs propaganda to cooperate with various central tasks; at the same time, each team must operate according to the principles of enterprise management. Everyone examined the problems existing in the work, focusing on criticizing the film craftsman's style of showing films for the sake of showing films and the purely economic view of showing films for the sake of charging fees.

In the past, film education work teams in various systems were not organized in a unified way, which caused many problems in the work and affected the propaganda effect. At this conference, representatives appointed by relevant agencies jointly formed the "Liaodong Province Film Education Work Team Joint Management Committee" to determine that the film education work teams in various systems should be under the unified leadership of the Joint Management Committee, uniformly divide the screening areas, uniformly schedule films, uniformly set ticket prices, uniformly formulate screening plans for the entire province, and uniformly stipulate work tasks and business systems, in order to exert greater work efficiency, and to establish a film screening network in the Liaodong area without cinemas in an organized and planned way, so that films can be universally and deeply rooted in the vast rural areas, factories, mines, forests, railway lines, and coastal islands.

    辽东省电影教育工作队确定企业化经营原则
    在一月二十六日到三十日举行的辽东省第一届电影教育工作队队长联席会议，有相当大的收获。经过讨论后，大家明确地认识了电影教育工作队工作方针：普遍深入无影院地区，为工农兵服务，做好影片内容解释工作，并要利用幻灯、讲演、图片展览等形式，进行政策和时事宣传以配合各个中心工作；同时，各队必须按企业化原则经营。大家检查了工作中存在的问题，着重批判了为放映而放映的电影匠作风和为收费而放映的单纯经济观点。
    各系统电影教育工作队过去没有统一组织起来，因而工作中产生了许多问题，影响宣传效果。在这次会议上，由有关机关指派代表共同组成“辽东省电影教育工作队联合管理委员会”，确定各系统电影教育工作队在联合管理委员会统一领导下，统一划分放映地区，统一排片，统一票价，统一制订全省范围的放映计划，统一规定工作任务与业务制度，以便发挥更大的工作效能，有组织、有计划地建立辽东无影院地区的电影放映网，使电影普遍深入广大的农村、工厂、矿山、森林、铁路沿线和沿海岛屿。
