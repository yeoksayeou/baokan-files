The 1953 production and labor plan (draft) of the Shijingshan Steel Plant was poorly prepared.

The plant's projected total output value for 1953 was only 11.7 percent higher than in 1952, but the total number of employees was to increase by 49.8 percent (with the proportion of staff to workers increasing from 8.6 percent to 10.5 percent, and the number of support staff increasing from 2 percent to 3.4 percent). As a result, labor productivity, calculated at fixed value, would decrease by 17.5 percent. Clearly, such a plan is very conservative and backward. At the same time, the plant demanded more than twice as many engineering and technical personnel as last year without considering whether it was possible, which shows that the plant's plan also has great blindness.

According to preliminary review by the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, this plan adds 1,800 people, and wage expenditures will increase by 12.4 billion yuan. Adding supplementary wages and the cost of building dormitories, the minimum cost would be 30 billion yuan.

The plant's production tasks did not increase much, but when formulating the plan, most workshop directors had the idea that "to increase production, we must increase people." Except for the foundry workshop, other workshops did not consider how to improve production organization and labor organization, but only requested a large increase in personnel. The same was true for various sections and divisions. The management department has already equipped 893 engineering and technical personnel and staff. From the current production tasks, the organization already seems large, but the heads of each section are still vying to add people and have incorporated these unreasonable demands into the 1953 plan.

The responsible cadres of the plant not only easily stamped their approval on this obviously conservative plan, but also personally came to Beijing to "appeal" to the Steel Industry Bureau when the Steel Industry Bureau reissued targets to reduce personnel: "The planned number of people cannot be reduced, reducing it will affect the completion of production tasks..." This shows that the plant's leadership lacks the idea of economic accounting. This is an important reason why the plant's plan is poorly done.

In addition, there is a saying among the plant's cadres: "It doesn't matter if there are more people, we are training cadres anyway." But for what purpose are they being trained? For which department? There is no clear plan. This argument that "increasing personnel is for training cadres" is actually an excuse for conservative thinking.

After studying the plant's production and labor plan (draft), the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Steel Industry Bureau reissued targets (reducing the original plan by 1,800 people) and sent a work team to the plant to study. It was proved that the new targets were feasible, and the plant director also agreed to implement them according to the targets. However, the plant must also hand over these targets to the masses, mobilize the masses to seriously discuss them, and pay attention to the following points:

	One, include maintenance work in the plan, formulate a regular maintenance system, and overcome the current phenomenon of not repairing things until they break. The coking workshop should do this well. Otherwise, it will make repair work unbalanced, increase the workload of repairs, and affect the completion of production tasks. Two, organize repair workers to learn technology. Because in medium and major repairs, a particularly large number of a certain type of repair worker is often needed at a certain time. If a repair worker understands more than two types of technology, the phenomenon of uneven workload can be overcome. If production workers are organized to learn minor repair techniques, the number of repair workers can also be reduced. This will prevent repair work from affecting the completion of production tasks. Three, vigorously improve labor organization and production organization. At present, there are still many shortcomings in the plant's labor organization and production organization. For example, the transportation department has not yet established a shift system, and the absenteeism rate of loading and unloading workers is more than 13 percent, with many taking sick leave, personal leave, and being absent without leave. To overcome this situation, in addition to strengthening labor discipline education, a shift system should be implemented so that the absenteeism rate can be reduced to a normal level. At the same time, loading and unloading methods must be improved to reduce labor intensity and strive to increase workload without increasing people. Four, the turnover rate of workers in the plant's transportation department is very high. In 1952, the turnover rate was more than 50 percent, which affected transportation work. The main reason is that there are problems with the wage system. The current collective piece-rate wage system has egalitarian shortcomings, and many workers are not at ease in their work. The plant should carefully study and improve the wage system and appropriately take care of the workers' welfare so that workers can work with peace of mind and reduce turnover. Five, in terms of staff, the management organization should be reformed, the division of labor should be clarified, procedures should be simplified, and the professional level of cadres should be improved to achieve the requirement of gradually reducing the proportion of staff year by year. Six, the plant also has some so-called "black staff," that is, people who work as staff in the name of workers, which affects production. This phenomenon should be quickly eliminated, and classified according to job positions. Seven, a plan for training cadres should be formulated according to needs, changing the idea that "more people are for training" and purposefully training the talents that will be truly needed in the future.

### 石景山钢铁厂生产劳动计划十分落后  中央重工业部钢铁工业局已予纠正

    石景山钢铁厂生产劳动计划十分落后
    中央重工业部钢铁工业局已予纠正
    石景山钢铁厂一九五三年生产劳动计划（草案）编制得很不好。
    该厂一九五三年总产值预计比一九五二年只提高百分之十一点七，但职工总数却要增加百分之四十九点八（其中职员占工人的比率由百分之八点六提高到百分之十点五，勤杂人员由百分之二增加到百分之三点四）。这样，以固定价值计算的劳动生产率，就下降了百分之十七点五。很明显，这样的计划是十分保守和落后的。同时该厂没有考虑是否可能，就要求比去年增加工程技术人员两倍多，这说明该厂的计划也带有很大的盲目性。
    据中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局初步审核，这个计划多安放了一千八百人，工资支出要增加一百二十四亿元，再加上附加工资及修建宿舍等费用，最少也要三百亿元。
    该厂生产任务增加不多，但在制订计划时，大多数车间主任都存在着“要增产就得增人”的思想；除铸造车间外，其他车间都没有考虑如何改进生产组织和劳动组织，只是要求大量增加人员。各科股也是如此。管理部门已经配备了八百九十三名工程技术人员和职员，从目前生产任务来看，机构已显得庞大，但各科负责人还争着添人，并把这不合理的要求编入了一九五三年的计划。
    该厂负责干部不但轻易地在这个一看就知道是很保守的计划上盖上了自己的图章，并在钢铁工业局重发指标减少人员时，还亲自来北京向钢铁工业局“呼吁”：“计划人数不能减少，减少就会影响生产任务的完成……。”这说明该厂领导方面还缺乏经济核算思想。这是该厂计划做得不好的重要原因。
    此外，该厂干部中还有一种说法：“多些人不要紧，反正是培养干部。”但为着什么目的培养？为那一部门培养？都没有个明确的计划。这种“增加人员是为了培养干部”的论调，实际上是保守思想的一种借口。
    中央重工业部及钢铁工业局研究了该厂生产劳动计划（草案）之后，重新颁发了指标（较原计划减少一千八百人），并派出工作组下厂研究，证明新的指标是切实可行的，该厂厂长也同意按指标执行。但该厂还必须把这一指标交给群众，发动群众认真讨论，并注意以下几点：
    一、把检修工作列入计划，制订定期检修制度，克服目前不坏不修的现象。炼焦车间更应很好作到这一点。否则就会使修理工作不能平衡，增加修理工作分量，影响生产任务的完成。二、组织修理工人学习技术。因在中修及大修中，往往在某一时期需要某一种修理工人特别多，如果一个修理工人懂得两种以上的技术，就可以克服忙闲不匀的现象。如果组织生产工人学习小修技术，也可以减少修理工人。这就不会因修理工作影响生产任务的完成。三、大力改善劳动组织和生产组织。目前该厂在劳动组织和生产组织方面还存在不少缺点。如运输部还没有建立轮休制度，装卸工人缺勤率达百分之十三以上，请病假、事假、旷工的也很多。要克服这种情况，除应加强劳动纪律教育，还应实行轮休制，这样才能使缺勤率降低到正常的情况。同时必须改善装卸方法，减少劳动强度，争取在不增加人的情况下提高工作量。四、该厂运输部门的工人流动性很大，一九五二年流动率达百分之五十以上，影响运输工作。主要原因是工资制度有问题。目前实行的集体计件工资制存在着平均主义的毛病，很多工人不安心工作。该厂应很好地研究改善工资制度，并适当地照顾工人的福利，使工人安心工作，减少流动性。五、在职员方面，应改革管理组织，明确分工，简化手续，提高干部业务水平，以达到职员比重逐年降低的要求。六、该厂还有些所谓“黑职员”，即以工人的名义作职员工作的人，影响了生产。这种现象应迅速消灭，按工作岗位明确分类。七、应根据需要制订培养干部的计划，改变“人多就是为了培养”的想法，有目的地培养将来真正需要的人材。
