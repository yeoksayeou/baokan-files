    Model People's Teacher Shi Xinmin

    Shi Xinmin was twenty-six years old and came from Aimin Township, Caoxi District, Jing County. Before liberation, he taught in private schools and primary schools for two or three years, and later switched to business for a while. After liberation, through the education of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, his ideological awareness gradually improved. In 1951, he participated in a teacher training class and was assigned to work at the Baocun Central Primary School in Jing County in the second half of the same year. After Shi Xinmin participated in revolutionary educational work, he established the idea of serving the people due to the cultivation and education of the Party and the People's Government. He was consistently conscientious and responsible in his work, possessed a high degree of diligence and hard work, and was able to go deep among the masses and connect with them, earning the enthusiastic support of the masses. In the first half of 1952, Shi Xinmin took the lead in transporting public grain and donated his salary to the school as a fund. When transporting grain, he carried each 170-jin bag of grain from Baocun to Sukou (river mouth), which was more than ten miles away, and then used rafts for transportation, personally going into the water to pull the rafts. Because of the hot weather and long distance, he suffered from heatstroke, but he still insisted on poling the raft. This spirit deeply moved the masses, prompting them to participate in grain transportation.

    Shi Xinmin was also very patient in educating naughty children and achieved certain results. For example, Bao Shitong, a first-grade student, had been studying for several years but failed to advance each year, and everyone thought he was impossible to teach. After Shi Xinmin became the teacher in charge of the class, he was determined to focus on Bao Shitong and patiently transform him. He would play with him and talk to him individually after class every day; he did not mind that he was dirty and slept with him during the noon break; he would also go to his home every night to urge him to wash his face and feet and tell his parents how to educate children; he was also very concerned about his studies and discussed with other teachers to educate him in various ways. After a long period of education, Bao Shitong made significant progress and became a diligent and good student.

    Shi Xinmin was also able to correctly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. When the school held self-criticism meetings, he actively spoke with a kind attitude towards others, focusing on shortcomings, which made the meeting effective. He always took the initiative to do his work and never shirked responsibility. Shi Xinmin always escorted students home after school every day, rain or shine. On the evening of September 19, 1952, he escorted twelve students across the river home after evening school. On the way, they had to pass a long and narrow wooden bridge. Because of heavy rains in recent days, the river had risen sharply (an average of six to seven feet deep), and because the bridge was long and narrow, making it difficult to help, he had to take care of them from behind and repeatedly told the students to walk carefully. Unexpectedly, while walking in the middle of the bridge, a first-grade student, Liu Bangxian (male, eight years old), accidentally fell into the water. At that time, a student of the same grade, Zhang Nianyi (female, nine years old), was also pulled into the water while trying to save him. Shi Xinmin immediately jumped into the water with his clothes on to rescue them. He paddled forward with all his might while shouting to the students on the shore to call for help. At that time, because the river was wide and the water was rapid, the students who fell into the water were carried downstream. Because his clothes were soaked, making it difficult to move, he was still a few feet away from the students despite his best efforts. Fortunately, militiaman Bao Shishuang swam up and rescued Liu Bangxian. At this time, Shi Xinmin was exhausted and unable to hold on. Bao Hanshu, a township cadre on the shore, shouted loudly, "Teacher Shi, come up quickly, you can't do it!" But Shi Xinmin kept shouting, "Save the children! Save the children!" and desperately paddled towards the student Zhang Nianyi. By the time Bao Shishuang went into the water again and rescued Zhang Nianyi, Shi Xinmin had been swept away by the river and gloriously sacrificed his life.

    模范人民教师施新民
    施新民今年二十六岁，泾县漕溪区爱民乡人。解放前曾教过两三年私塾和小学，后一度转业经商。解放后经过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝运动的教育，思想觉悟逐渐提高，一九五一年他参加了教师训练班学习，同年下半年分配到泾县包村中心小学工作。施新民参加革命教育工作后，由于党和人民政府的培养和教育，树立了为人民服务的思想。他平时对工作一贯认真负责，有高度刻苦耐劳的精神，能够深入群众、联系群众，得到群众的热烈拥护。一九五二年上半年，施新民曾带头运送公粮，并把所得工资献给学校作基金。在运粮时，他把每包一百七十市斤的粮袋从包村挑到相距十多里的苏口（河口），再改用筏运，并亲自下水拉筏。因为天热路远，他发了痧子，但还是坚持撑筏，这种精神深深感动了群众，使他们纷纷来参加运粮。
    施新民对顽劣儿童的教育也非常耐心，并且收到一定的效果。如一年级学生包仕桐，已经读了好几年书，年年不能升级，大家都认为没办法教。自从施新民担任该班级任教师后，就决心把包仕桐作为重点，耐心地改造他，每天一下课就带着他玩，和他个别谈话；午睡时不嫌他肮脏，和他一块儿睡；每天晚上还到他家里去，督促他洗脸洗脚，并告诉家长教育儿童的方法；对他的学业也非常关心，和其他老师商量，从多方面来教育他。这样，经过长期的教育，包仕桐有了显著的进步，变成了一个用功的好学生。
    施新民还能正确地掌握批评与自我批评的武器，学校里开检讨会时，他以与人为善的态度针对缺点踊跃发言，使会议收到良好效果。工作方面他总是主动地去做，从不推诿。施新民每天放学后总是护送学生回家，风雨无阻。一九五二年九月十九日放晚学时，他护送对河的十二名学生回家，途中必须经过一条长且窄的木桥，因连日大雨河水暴涨（平均六七尺深），又因桥长且窄不便搀扶，他只得随后照顾，并再三叮嘱学生好好走。不料行至桥中，一年级学生刘邦先（男，八岁）失足落水，当时同级学生张年意（女，九岁）因急忙挽救亦被带入水中，施新民当即和衣奋身跳入水中抢救。他一面用力向前划，一面喊岸上学生快喊人来协助。当时因河宽水急，落水学生顺流而下。他因衣服沾身，行动不便，虽尽全力，仍离开学生有几尺远，幸民兵包仕爽游水赶上，才救起了刘邦先。这时施新民已精疲力竭，不能支持，岸上乡干部包汉书就大声喊道：“施老师快上来，你不行了！”但施新民还连连喊叫：“救小孩子！救小孩子！”并拚命向小学生张年意划去。及至包仕爽再度下水把张年意救起时，施新民已被河水卷没而光荣殉职了。
