    Beijing Municipal People's Government Makes Decision on Utilizing Hot Springs in Suburban Hot Spring Village

    Editor's Note: After the letter "Hot Springs in Suburban Hot Spring Village, Beijing, Should Be Fully Utilized by the Masses" was published in the "Reader's Letters" column on December 25th of last year, both the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have replied with letters. We believe that the decision of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is very thorough, taking into account both the current needs of the masses and the future needs of the capital's construction. We are now publishing excerpts of these two letters below:

    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry replied in a letter, saying: In the future, the number of personnel receiving treatment here will continue to increase. It will be very inconvenient for the school to continue managing the hot springs, and it will be difficult to meet the needs of the masses. In order to make full use of the natural spring water, we agree to separate the hot spring area from the primary school and place it under the management of the local People's Government, and to make appropriate regulations regarding the time for students and the masses to use the spring water.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Urban Planning Commission wrote in a letter, saying: This issue has been submitted to the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and it was decided during the joint office meeting in the fifth week of this year: If the leadership relationship of the primary school for employees' children of the Ministry of Heavy Industry remains with the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the future, after the Ministry's new office building is completed, the Municipal Government can allocate appropriate land near the Ministry's new site for the construction of a primary school. The current site of the primary school will be handed over to the Municipal Government to prepare for the construction of a sanatorium, so as to make full use of the hot springs. Currently, the hot spring area can be temporarily separated from the primary school first. After the above method is agreed upon by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the hot spring will be handed over to the Park Management Committee for management.

### 北京市人民政府对利用郊区温泉村温泉问题已作出决定

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市人民政府对利用郊区温泉村温泉问题已作出决定
    编者按：去年十二月二十五日“读者来信专页”发表了“北京郊区温泉村温泉应该充分供群众利用”的来信后，中央重工业部和北京市人民政府都已来信答复。我们认为北京市人民政府的决定很周到，既照顾了当前群众的需要，又考虑了今后首都建设的需要。现在把这两封信摘要发表在下面：
    中央重工业部来信答复说：今后该处疗养人员不断增加，温泉如由学校继续经管很不方便，也难满足群众需要。为了充分利用天然泉水，我们同意将温泉部分从小学划出，由当地人民政府掌管，并对学生及群众使用泉水的时间作适当的规定。
    北京市人民政府都市计划委员会来信说：这个问题已提交北京市人民政府，在今年第五周联合办公时决定：重工业部职工子弟小学领导关系将来如仍属重工业部，在该部新建办公楼房落成后，本府可在该部新址附近另拨适当土地供修建小学使用，该小学现址即交本府筹建休养所，以便充分利用温泉。目前可先暂将温泉部分从小学划出。上述办法经重工业部同意后，该温泉即交由公园管理委员会负责管理。
