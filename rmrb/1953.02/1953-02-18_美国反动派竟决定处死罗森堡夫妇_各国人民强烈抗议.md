Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th: Following Eisenhower's brazen decision to reject the Rosenbergs' appeal for the reversal of their unreasonable sentence, New York Federal Judge Irving Kaufman announced on the 16th that the Rosenbergs would be executed by electrocution within the week beginning March 9, according to the original verdict of the New York Federal Court.

The Rosenbergs were an ordinary, kind couple in the United States who advocated peace and freedom. The American ruling clique framed them with completely fabricated charges, with the aim of creating terror and tension, intimidating peace fighters, and facilitating their intensified war preparations and fascist rule.

The Rosenbergs repeatedly appealed, and honest people in the United States and around the world revealed the framing nature of the verdict and expressed their protests.

However, Eisenhower stubbornly rejected the Rosenbergs' appeal, which more clearly demonstrated the extremely reactionary nature of the US government and immediately aroused widespread protest. In New York, a delegation of seven hundred people traveled by special train to Washington on the 14th, where they and people's representatives from other parts of the United States organized a round-the-clock vigil in front of the White House.

News from Europe reported that people everywhere in Europe were protesting Eisenhower's decision. In Berlin, thousands of people held protest rallies; in West Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, and other places, people also expressed their protests. A vicar from the parish of Thanet in England prayed for the framed Rosenbergs and called for saving their lives at the last moment. The famous French writer Mauriac also demanded the repeal of the death sentence against the Rosenbergs on the 16th. In front of American consulates in many places, protesting people organized demonstrations.

According to the New York "Daily Worker" on the 15th, Mrs. Rosenberg sent a letter from prison, reiterating that she and her husband were innocent. She also solemnly rejected her mother's request for her to fabricate a confession and admit guilt in order to obtain clemency, reiterating that she and her husband could not abandon justice because of the terror of death.

    美国反动派竟决定处死罗森堡夫妇
    各国人民强烈抗议
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：在艾森豪威尔悍然决定拒绝罗森堡夫妇要求撤销对他们的无理判决的申诉之后，纽约联邦法官欧温·考夫曼十六日宣布，罗森堡夫妇将在三月九日起的一星期中按原纽约联邦法院的判决用电刑处死。
    罗森堡夫妇是美国一对主张和平与自由的普通的善良公民。美国统治集团用完全虚构的罪名进行陷害，目的在制造恐怖和紧张空气，威吓和平战士，便利他们加紧战争准备和法西斯统治。
    罗森堡夫妇曾一再上诉，美国和世界各地正直人民也纷纷揭露判决的陷害性质，表示抗议。
    但艾森豪威尔仍蛮横地拒绝了罗森堡夫妇的申诉，这更清楚地表明了美国政府极端反动的本质，也立即引起了广泛的抗议。在纽约，一个由七百人组成的代表团在十四日专车赶往华盛顿，他们和从美国其他地方去的人民代表在白宫前组织昼夜不息的请愿。
    从欧洲来的消息报道，欧洲各地人民到处对艾森豪威尔的决定表示抗议。在柏林，数千人民举行了抗议大会；在西德、英国、法国、比利时等地，人民也纷纷表示抗议。英格兰桑泰德教区的牧师替被陷害的罗森堡夫妇祈祷，并呼吁在最后一刻挽救罗森堡夫妇的生命。法国著名文学家莫里亚十六日也要求撤销对罗森堡夫妇死刑判决。在不少地方的美国领事馆前，抗议的人民组织了示威游行。
    据纽约“工人日报”十五日报道，罗森堡夫人从监狱里发出一封信，再次表明她夫妇是无罪的。她并且严正地拒绝了她母亲要她捏造供辞、承认有罪以取得宽赦的请求，重申她夫妇不能因死的恐怖而放弃正义。
