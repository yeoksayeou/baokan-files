Xinhua News Agency, February 7th: The Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee issued a notice regarding guaranteeing railway loading and unloading work during the Spring Festival holiday. The original text is as follows:

	National large-scale economic construction has begun, and railway transportation tasks are very heavy. In order to ensure the completion of its transportation plan, it is specifically stipulated that:
	(1) Railway loading and unloading work should proceed as usual during and around the Spring Festival holiday in February. Railways and various consigning units should jointly ensure the completion of the average daily loading volume of the monthly plan.
	(2) Employees working on loading and unloading during the Spring Festival holiday should be paid loading and unloading wages in accordance with the method stipulated in this Committee's (52) Finance and Economics Planning and Transportation Document No. 655 of April 28, 1952.

Xinhua News Agency, February 7th: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government instructed all bureaus to do a good job in Spring Festival passenger transport and to ensure that freight transport proceeds as usual. According to preliminary investigations, the number of Spring Festival passengers this year will increase by one million compared to the same period last year. In order to solve the problem of too many passengers and too few trains during the Spring Festival, the Ministry of Railways instructed all bureaus to fully utilize existing passenger cars, put all existing spare passenger cars into Spring Festival transport, and improve vehicle turnaround speed to ensure on-time operation. Insufficient passenger cars should be replaced with boxcars, and short-distance trains should be added, charged at 80% of the ordinary ticket price. On the other hand, the railways should proactively contact local factories, mines, government agencies, schools, and organizations to understand passenger flow, organize group rides, and adjust travel dates to achieve planned transportation. At the same time, in view of the impact of the surge in passenger transport on freight transport, it was decided that all bureaus should mobilize employees and cooperate with consigning departments to ensure that the average daily loading volume during the Spring Festival is maintained according to the original consignment plan. Employees working on loading and unloading should be paid double wages in accordance with the method stipulated in the Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee's notice of April 28, 1952.

    政务院财经委员会发布通知
    保证春节铁路装卸工作
    铁道部指示各局做好春节客运 【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会发布关于保证春节假期铁路装卸工作的通知。原文如下：
    国家大规模经济建设已经开始，铁路运输任务甚为繁重，为保证其运输计划的完成，特规定：
    （一）二月份春节假期及其前后，铁路装卸工作应照常进行。铁路与各托运单位应共同保证完成月度计划之每日平均装车数。
    （二）对春节假期出勤装卸之职工，应照本委一九五二年四月二十八日（52）财经计交字第六五五号通知所规定的办法支付装卸工资。 【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府铁道部指示各局做好春节旅客运输工作，并保证货物运输照常进行。据初步调查，今年春节旅客将比去年同期增加一百万人，为了解决春节期间人多车少的问题，铁道部指示各局一方面充分利用现有的客车，把现有备用客车全部投入春节运输，并提高车辆运转速度，保证正点运行。不足的客车用棚车代替，加开短途列车，按普通票价八折计费。另一方面，铁路应主动与当地工矿、机关、学校、团体联系，掌握旅客流动情况，组织团体乘车，调整乘车日期，做到有计划地运送。同时，根据客运激增后将使货运受到影响的情况，决定各局发动职工，协同托运部门，保证春节期间按原提托运计划的每日平均装车数照常装车。对出勤装卸的职工，按照中财委一九五二年四月二十八日通知所规定的办法支付装卸职工双薪。
