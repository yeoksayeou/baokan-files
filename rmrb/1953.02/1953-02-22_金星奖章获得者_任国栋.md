    Gold Star Medal Winner – Ren Guodong
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    (Continued from yesterday) Large-Scale Working Methods
    Many regions have produced famous labor models, bumper harvest households, and even bumper harvest villages. However, the other farmers in the villages where the labor models and bumper harvest households are located, and the other villages in the districts and counties where the bumper harvest villages are located, remain quiet and silent. This makes one feel as if this model, this bumper harvest household, and this bumper harvest village are like a lonely island in the sea. Why does this phenomenon occur? – Without asking in detail, it must be that the work style and methods of the cadres here, especially the leading cadres, have only solved the "breakthrough at one point" problem, but have not solved the "promote overall" problem.
    Going deep among the masses and gathering the wisdom and experience of the masses is only the first step. If it is not promoted and the broad masses cannot master it and turn it into the wealth of the broad masses, it is still impossible to lead the masses to advance rapidly together. Just like what has happened in many places.
    Ren Guodong is not like this. He is not only good at going deep among the masses, keenly discovering the experience of the masses, concentrating and improving it, but also good at promoting it. The method of mass work runs through all of Ren Guodong's work. When the cadres of Zhaoyuan County talked about the influence and education that the county party secretary had on them, many people said: "Secretary Ren's most profound influence on me and the greatest education he gave me was his working method of following the mass line."
    Many county and district cadres have told me about such a thing.
    In 1950, after American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, cadres and masses in various parts of Heilongjiang Province took active actions: they mobilized and organized volunteers one after another. Many county and district cadres in Zhaoyuan County also suggested to the county party committee that they should quickly mobilize the masses to participate in the volunteer army. However, Ren Guodong said: "Don't worry, let's first conduct an education on the comparison between the new and old countries among the masses, and then organize the volunteer army." At that time, many cadres were worried that this approach would be left behind by other counties. Ren Guodong's answer was negative. Later facts proved that his opinion was correct. When this work began, wherever we went to a village or entered a family, there was a cry of accusation and grief. – How deep was the suffering and misfortune that the old society and the old country gave to the people! But on the third day, when the masses discussed the third question – "What should we do if the United States wants to invade our new country?" – the situation changed drastically. Anger and curses replaced the painful cries, and courageous actions replaced the bitter memories. Old men shaved off their beards, and women cut their hair, asking to go to Korea to fight the invaders, defend the new country, and defend their happy new life. A vigorous movement to join the army was launched throughout the county. By the seventh day, the number of people in the county who had joined the volunteer army had exceeded 16,000.
    In the spring of 1952, Zhaoyuan appeared as enthusiastic as it was in the autumn of 1950. During the day, the vast fields were filled with people, some measuring with bows and rulers, some checking the number of plants, and looking for the reasons for low yields. At night, villages were filled with groups here and there, some weighing with scales, some using abacuses, and some hotly debating, calculating the possibility of increasing land production, and revising and improving their production increase plans.
    Spring plowing has created a real upsurge in Zhaoyuan. This enthusiastic spring plowing movement was initiated by Ren Guodong.
    Ren Guodong stayed in Sihetun for three days. After proving from the promotion of new cultivation methods in five villages including Sihetun, Yimianpo, and Kaoshan that this new cultivation method was correct and an effective method for increasing production, he wrote a detailed letter to the county party committee, asking the county committee to study and promote it. He himself went to the third, fifth, sixth, twelfth and other districts to implement it. Wherever he went, a new atmosphere appeared in the production movement there. The peasants' enthusiasm for production rose rapidly like the spring tide of the Songhua River. The village cadres of the twelfth district heard Ren Guodong's detailed explanation of this new cultivation method at the cadres' meeting held in the district, and rushed back to their villages overnight to "report the good news" to the masses. The head of Zhiyuan Village returned to the village without entering his home, and went to the village government to hold a meeting. On the same night, all four mutual aid groups in the village revised their bumper harvest plans, and took active actions the next day; they sent people to the county seat to buy copper sulfate to prepare for seed disinfection. Farmers who had already started sowing large fields also widened their sowing width... The Bi Guoquan mutual aid group in Gongyingzi Village, Sixth District, originally planned to produce 387 dan of grain from 52 hectares. After implementing the new cultivation method, it was increased to 628 dan, an average of 11 dan and 9 dou and 2 sheng per hectare, which was 1.38 times higher than the yield in 1951. The Peng Xijiang agricultural production cooperative in the fifth district set a plan of an average of 20 dan per hectare, but Zhang Dianwen, the most conservative member of the cooperative, still said: "As long as we implement the new method, we don't have to worry about not harvesting it."
    Personally going to various districts and villages to promote and implement the new cultivation method and set an example is only one aspect of Ren Guodong's working method. Mobilizing and organizing forces and leading all cadres to carry out work is another aspect of his working method. Ren Guodong turned the county party committee into a command headquarters for implementing the new cultivation method. In addition to going to various districts to implement the new cultivation method, the members of the county party committee also organized the power of the entire party. The party's reporters, propagandists, and cadres of the Communist Youth League and various people's organizations were all organized on the front line of implementing the new cultivation method, setting off a county-wide, large-scale propaganda movement. Therefore, although the new cultivation method was only put forward after the start of spring plowing, it was still implemented more deeply and universally among the masses during the spring plowing stage. By May 20, among the 187 villages in the county, 125 villages had re-increased their bumper harvest plans, and their output generally increased by about 100%. 106 villages, more than 2,300 mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives launched patriotic bumper harvest competitions with each other.
    The prairie is boiling
    The promotion of a new thing will always encounter various kinds of obstruction and resistance from traditional forces. Although the promotion of the new cultivation method was relatively smooth at the beginning, this does not mean that the peasants accepted and implemented it all without reservation. Farmers were more likely to accept "equal-distance wide sowing", so it was easier to promote during spring sowing. However, the method of "equal-distance thinning and seedling protection" encountered strong resistance from traditional habits. Farmers in northern Manchuria have no habit of thinning seedlings - if there is, it is a very sloppy "sparse retention of thick, thick retention of sparse, non-sparse and non-thick retention of large." Or "leave a strip in the middle whether there are seedlings or not."
    When promoting the new cultivation method during the spring plowing period, many farmers implemented wide sowing, and those who did not implement wide sowing planted more carefully than in previous years. The small seedlings grew up, thick and strong, and green, which was really gratifying. The peasants of Zhaoyuan, who originally had no habit of thinning seedlings, were even more reluctant to thin them when they saw such good seedlings. When the old farmers heard the cadres promoting thinning seedlings, they brought out the agricultural proverbs that had been circulating for many years to resist: "Ten ears are worth one ear, and there are nine more sticks!" Most farmers were afraid that thinning the seedlings would reduce the number of seedlings and reduce the amount of grain. Although some people believed that thinning seedlings could produce more grain, how much more could they produce? They didn't know. They were worried that the extra grain would not be enough for the labor cost of thinning seedlings, so they were unwilling to thin them. Under such circumstances, the party mobilized cadres, party members, and activists to set an example, educate the peasants with facts, and promote thinning seedlings. At that time, the valley seedlings were only more than an inch high. After thinning the seedlings, the ground was gray and bald, and no seedlings could be seen. Bending down to look carefully, you could see the small seedlings left behind, crawling on the ground crookedly. Not to mention those who had always opposed thinning seedlings, even the advanced elements who believed that thinning seedlings could increase production were not confident when they saw this situation. They said in distress: "This is blind." However, five or six days later, the small seedlings "returned to life", each with a fat head and big ears, and the valley seedlings were as thick and strong and black with green as small sorghum seedlings. Compared with this, the unthinned crops were yellow and waxy and did not look like anything. The masses gradually accepted the new cultivation method of "thinning seedlings" after seeing the actual effect of thinning seedlings with their own eyes. But it only really became a widespread mass movement after Ren Guodong arrived in Xinfa Village and launched a mass visit and evaluation movement from there.
    When plowing the first seedlings, Ren Guodong came to Xinfa Village in the third district. As always, after arriving in the village, he put down his luggage and went to the field. The peasants Huang Taiyan and Li Zaiyu, who were plowing the seedlings, said to him: "Go and see Wu Dianxiang's sorghum, it's the best in the village." Wu Dianxiang's sorghum was indeed good, it grew black and strong, and the "seedlings were dense." The masses praised: "It's 120% seedlings!" Ren Guodong measured Wu Dianxiang's crops with steps, and it was seven plants per step (five feet), so he said, "There are three seedlings missing per step!" He asked the masses to think about how big the sorghum roots are? "Half a foot in radius," Ren Guodong said, "There are only seven plants per five feet of land, isn't that a waste of land?" The peasants certainly knew how big the sorghum roots were, and after Ren Guodong mentioned it, they understood even more. "Isn't that a waste of land?" Ren Guodong gave everyone a detailed account at that time. Just because there were three seedlings missing per step, each hectare of land would yield four or five dan less grain. After this detailed calculation, Wu Dianxiang panicked and regretted: "What should I do?" Ren Guodong then told him that he could transplant seedlings to replant. "That's useless!" Wu Dianxiang opposed: "There are people who transplant trees, but who transplants crop seedlings? They will definitely die." Ren Guodong advised him: "Let's try it." So he picked up a shovel and transplanted soil from the dense seedlings to the sparse places. Although Wu Dianxiang didn't believe it, he had to do it together since the county party secretary was transplanting seedlings for him. In order to see the effect, they only replanted 468 plants. Wu Dianxiang said: "Let's see first!" and stopped. At noon the next day, when the sun was shining brightly, Ren Guodong invited Wu Dianxiang to the field to take a look. The transplanted seedlings were all straight and energetic, and it was impossible to tell which were transplanted and which were originally planted. What was originally a very ordinary thing turned into a rare thing, and all the men, women, old and young in the village ran to see it. The masses believed in "transplanting seedlings to replant" in the face of the facts. On the same day, each mutual aid group started to work and replanted more than ten hectares. An old peasant - Wu He's father, who was more than 60 years old, while replanting seedlings, thanked Ren Guodong and said: "You came here and our village will harvest dozens more dan of grain." However, Ren Guodong was thinking about another question at this time, thinking about the enthusiastic actions of the masses when they came to the field to visit just now. "This is a good way." He decided, so he immediately told all districts: "We must cultivate typical examples and set an example, and at the same time organize the masses to visit..."
    After plowing the first seedlings, "visiting and evaluation" has formed a movement. Women wearing colorful clothes, farmers wearing wide-brimmed straw hats, sitting on rubber-tired carts with three horses, speeding across the summer prairie - the prairie is boiling.
    "Where are you going?" the people on this cart asked.
    "Visiting the county farm," the people on that cart replied: "Where are you going?"
    "Wang Zhentang Agricultural Production Cooperative!"
    During the summer weeding period, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee organized nearly 80,000 people to visit and evaluate the fields, and focused on organizing the masses to visit the state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives that had done the best in "thinning and protecting seedlings." This eliminated the obstacles to thinning and protecting seedlings, and launched a mass movement of thinning and protecting seedlings throughout the county. More than 30,000 hectares of various crops implemented the equal-distance thinning and cultivation method, and more than 5,000 hectares implemented seedling replanting.
    Combined with the visit and evaluation, there was also a county-wide mobile red flag competition movement. In summer, the prairie is extremely lively. The winners hold their red flags high and go to the fields to produce. When they come back from work, they hang the red flags high in front of the group leader's door. Red flags are flying everywhere on the prairie and in the villages. The red flag competition promoted the successful completion of the summer weeding work throughout the county, and also accumulated more than one million carts of fertilizer during the summer weeding period. This is something that has never happened in Zhaoyuan's agricultural production. The old habit of "hanging Erlang Dang and developing the wasteland," thinking that the land is fertile and does not need fertilizer, has been further overcome with the promotion of the new cultivation method and with the red flag competition.
    The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee also used the gap in production to train 12,000 mutual aid group leaders, more than 1,000 propagandists, and more than 30,000 women. It was because of their leadership and mobilization that the patriotic bumper harvest movement in Zhaoyuan County formed a large-scale mass movement that spread throughout the county and throughout the year. The cooperative mutual aid movement has been further developed and improved. Women have become an important force in production. During the summer weeding period, 85% of the women participated in the seedling thinning work. It is because of these reasons that Zhaoyuan County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1952. According to incomplete statistics from the county people's government in December, the land of 1,078 mutual aid groups averaged 9 dan of grain per hectare; the entire land of 565 mutual aid groups and 194 villages, 43 villages averaged 10 dan per hectare; the county achieved an unprecedented high yield on a large area of 321 hectares, with a harvest of more than 20 dan per hectare.
    Toward new victories
    Such a large-scale, county-wide bumper harvest is only a harvest of Comrade Ren Guodong's leadership of the patriotic bumper harvest movement, and may not even be an important harvest. His main achievement is to find a way to rapidly improve China's agricultural production under the current conditions. His main achievement is to provide the vast number of cadres with a good method for leading large-scale agricultural construction.
    Half a month later, when I said goodbye to Comrade Ren Guodong, warmly congratulating him on his great contribution to China's agricultural construction and wishing him new achievements in 1953, this simple and modest county party secretary said: "I am just following Chairman Mao's teachings and learning to follow the mass line. Without the leadership of the party and without Chairman Mao's education, what can I do?"
    "There are still two major shortcomings in our work. One is that the new cultivation method is implemented unevenly and not universally; the other is that there is still a lot of blindness, unscientific, and non-standard in the implementation of the new cultivation method." Ren Guodong continued:
    "In 1953, our task is to promote the new cultivation method in every village in the county. And to apply the new cultivation method according to the characteristics of climate, soil, and different crops. To make those who have already achieved high yields continue to improve, and those with low yields to catch up quickly."
    When I left Zhaoyuan, the county party committee had already put forward the tasks and requirements of the 1953 patriotic bumper harvest movement. In 1953, the average unit area yield of the county's 118,000 hectares of land should reach 10 dan per hectare, an increase of 33% compared to 1952; to create a large area bumper harvest of 10,000 jin per hectare on 5,000 hectares of land; to make 1,000 mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and 40 villages, become bumper harvest groups (cooperatives) and bumper harvest villages.
    This is not just a beautiful plan. The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee has already started a series of preparatory work for the 1953 patriotic bumper harvest movement since the autumn harvest. Now, no matter which village you walk into in Zhaoyuan County, you will see a small agricultural production exhibition room. In this exhibition room, there are specimens of the best crops in the village, and detailed explanations about how it achieved a bumper harvest; in this exhibition room, there are also descriptions of the worst-growing crops in the village and the reasons for its yield reduction. This exhibition room does not cost much, but it has a great effect. It not only educates the peasants with the scientific principles of the new cultivation method, but also educates the peasants with the actual effects of the new cultivation method. It makes the peasants believe in science, believe in their own strength, and specifically and vividly encourages the peasants' enthusiasm for production, paving the way for a higher patriotic bumper harvest movement in 1953.
    The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee has also done many other preparatory work in other aspects. From this many preparatory work - from the intensive and in-depth rural party rectification work that is underway; from the work of rectifying mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives; from the growing trust and support of the vast number of peasants for the new cultivation method; especially under the personal leadership of Comrade Ren Guodong, the ideological preparation, organizational preparation and material preparation made by all departments and all cadres in the county - it can be clearly seen that Zhaoyuan County will achieve this glorious task. We have reason to wish Zhaoyuan County an even higher bumper harvest in 1953. There is reason to wish Comrade Ren Guodong new achievements.

    金星奖章获得者——任国栋
    本报记者　田流
    （续昨）大规模的工作方法
    有不少地区出现了著名的劳动模范、丰产户甚至丰产村。但劳动模范、丰产户所在村庄的其他农民，丰产村所在的区、县的其他村庄，却静悄悄的寂然无声。让人感到这位模范、这个丰产户和丰产村好像是大海中一个孤单单的小岛。为什么会发生这种现象呢？——不用细问，一定是这里的干部，特别是领导干部的作风和工作方法，只解决了“突破一点”问题，却没有解决“推动全面”问题。
    深入群众，把群众的智慧、经验集中起来，这只是第一步。如果不把它推广，不能使广大群众掌握它，变成广大群众的财富，还是不能领导群众一起迅速前进的。正像不少地方发生的那样。
    任国栋不是这样。他不仅善于深入群众，锐敏地发现群众经验，把它集中、提高起来，还善于把它推广出去。任国栋的全部工作中，到处贯穿着群众工作的方法。肇源县的干部谈到县委书记给自己的影响和教育时，许多人都说：“任书记对我影响最深、教育最大的，是他走群众路线的工作方法。”
    好多县、区干部，都给我谈过这样一件事情。
    一九五○年，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，黑龙江省各地的干部、群众，都积极行动起来：纷纷地动员与组织志愿军。肇源县的许多县、区干部也向县委会建议：应该迅速动员群众参加志愿军。可是任国栋说：“不要急，我们先在群众中进行一次新、旧国家对比的教育，过后再组织志愿军。”当时，有不少干部担心这种作法会不会被别的县拉在后边。任国栋的回答是否定的。后来的事实证实了他的意见是正确的。开始进行这个工作时，无论走到那一个村庄，走进哪一个家庭，到处是一片控诉声、悲泣声。——旧社会，旧国家给予人民的，是多么深重的苦难与不幸啊！但到第三天，当群众讨论到第三个问题——“美国要来侵略我们的新国家，应该怎么办？”的时候，情形大变了。愤怒与咒骂代替了辛酸的哭诉，勇敢的行动代替了悲苦的回忆。老头子剃掉了胡子，妇女们剪掉了头发，要求到朝鲜去打击侵略者，保卫新国家，保卫自己幸福的新生活。一个轰轰烈烈的参军运动，便在全县展开了。到了第七天，全县参加志愿军的人数，已经超过一万六千人。
    一九五二年春天的肇源，又出现一九五○年秋天那样热烈的情景。白天，广大田野上布满了人群，有的量弓尺，有的查棵数，寻找产量不高的原因。夜晚，村庄上这里一伙、那里一组，有的拿秤称，有的拨算盘，也有的在热烈争辩，计算着土地增产的可能性，修改和提高他们的增产计划。
    春耕已在肇源造成真正的热潮。这个热烈的春耕运动，是任国栋掀起来的。
    任国栋在四合屯住了三天。从四合屯、一面坡、靠山屯等五个村推行新耕作法中证明，这个新耕作法是正确的，是提高生产的有效方法以后，他写了
    一封详细的信给县委会，让县委们研究、推行。他自己便亲自到三、五、六、十二等区去贯彻去了。他走到那里，那里的生产运动就出现了新气象。农民的生产热情像松花江的春潮一样迅速地上涨着。十二区的村干部在区里召开的干部会上，听到任国栋详细解释了这个新耕作法，连夜赶回本村，向群众“报喜”。支援村村长回到村里，没入家门，就到村政府召开会议，当天晚上全村四个互助组都重新修订了丰产计划，第二天就积极行动起来；派人去县城买王铜，准备拌种消毒，已经开始播种大田的农民，也加宽了播幅……。六区公营子村毕国权互助组，原计划五十二垧共产三百八十七石粮。推行新耕作法后，提高到六百二十八石，平均每垧十一石九斗二升，比一九五一年的产量高一点三八倍。五区彭希江农业生产合作社，订出每垧平均二十石的计划，可是社里最保守的社员张殿文还说：“只要咱把新法贯彻了，不愁收不下。”
    亲自到各区、村推广，贯彻新耕作法，作出样子，只是任国栋工作方法的一个方面。动员组织力量，领导全体干部进行工作，是他的工作方法的另一面。任国栋使县委会变成了贯彻新耕作法的司令部。县委委员们除分头到各区贯彻新耕作法外，更把全党的力量组织起来。把党的报告员、宣传员和青年团、各人民团体的干部，都组织在贯彻新耕作法的战线上来，掀起了一个全县规模的、声势浩大的宣传运动。因此，虽然新耕作法是春耕开始后才提出来的，但仍然在春耕阶段，就比较深入普遍地贯彻到群众中去了。到五月二十日，全县一百八十七个村庄中，已有一百二十五个村庄重新增订了丰产计划，他们的产量一般都增加一倍左右。有一百零六个村庄、二千三百多个互助组和农业生产合作社，相互展开了爱国主义丰产竞赛。
    草原沸腾起来了
    一件新事物的推广，总会遇到各种各样传统势力的阻挠和抵抗。新耕作法开始推行时虽然比较顺利，但这并不说明农民毫无保留地全部接受它、实行它了。农民们对于“等距宽播”较易接受，因此，春耕播种时，推行起来也较容易。可是“等距的间苗、保苗的方法，就遭到了传统习惯的强烈抵抗。北满一带的农民，是没有间苗习惯的——要说有，也是非常潦草的“稀留厚、厚留稀，不稀不厚留大的。”或“有苗没苗当中留一条。”
    春耕期推行新耕作法时，许多农民实行了宽播，没有宽播的，也比往年种的细致。小苗长出来，粗粗壮壮绿油油的实在喜人。本来没有间苗习惯的肇源农民，见了这样的好秧苗，更舍不得间了。年老的农民听到干部宣传间苗时，就搬出流传多年的农谚来抵抗：“十穗抵一穗，还多九根棍”呢！大多数农民怕把苗间少了，少打粮食。有些人虽然相信间苗能多打粮食，但究竟能多打多少呢？不知道。他们耽心多打的那点粮食不够间苗的工夫钱，因此也不愿间苗。在这种情况下，党就动员干部、党员和积极分子作出样子，用事实教育农民，推广间苗。当时谷苗才一寸多高，间苗以后，满地灰秃秃地见不到苗，弯下腰去仔细找，才能看出留下的小苗，东倒西歪地爬在地上。不要说素来反对间苗的人，就是认为间苗能增产的先进分子看到这种情况，心里也不托底了。他们苦恼地说：“这算瞎了”。可是，五、六天后，小苗“还阳”了，一棵棵肥头大耳，谷苗就像小高粱苗一样，又粗又壮黑里带绿。没间苗的庄稼和这一比，黄腊腊的不像个样子。群众亲眼看到间苗的实际效果，才逐渐地接受了“间苗”的新耕作法。但真正成为广泛的群众运动，还是在任国栋到了新发村，从那里发动了群众性的参观评比运动以后。
    开铲头遍时，任国栋来到三区新发村。还是他那老习惯，来村后把行李一放，就到地里去了。正在铲苗的农民黄太炎、李在雨向他说：“去看看吴殿祥的高粱吧，全村头一份。”吴殿祥的高粱的确不错，长的又黑又壮，“苗也稠”，群众夸奖说：“十二成苗呢！”任国栋用步量了量吴殿祥的庄稼，合
    一步（五尺）七棵，便说“一步缺三棵苗！”他让群众想想高粱的根有多大？“半尺方圆”，任国栋说：“这地才五尺七棵，不是浪费了土地么？”农民当然知道高粱的根有多大，经任国栋这么一提，更明白了。“可不是浪费了土地？”任国栋当时给大家算了个细账，就因为一步缺三棵苗，一垧地就少收四、五石粮。这一算细账，吴殿祥着慌了，直后悔：“这可咋办？”任国栋便告诉他可以移苗补种。“那白搭！”吴殿祥反对道：“有移树栽树的，哪有移庄稼苗的？准死。”任国栋劝他说：“咱们试试看。”于是他拿起一把锨，从苗稠的地里连土移补在稀的地方。吴殿祥虽然不相信，见县委书记给自己移苗，也只得一块作起来。为了看看效果，他们只补了四百六十八棵。吴殿祥说：“先看看再说吧！”就停止了。到第二天中午，太阳晒得正厉害时，任国栋邀吴殿祥到地里一看，移来的苗都直挺挺的很精神，看不出哪是移来的，哪是原种的苗。本来很平常的事，倒变成稀奇事了，全村男女老幼都跑来看了。群众在事实面前相信“移苗补苗”了。当天，各个互助组就动起手来，补了十多垧。一个六十多岁的农民——吴和的老父亲，一面补苗，一面感谢地向任国栋说：“你来这一趟，俺村又多收几十石粮。”可是，任国栋这时却想着另外一个问题，想着刚才群众到地里来参观时候的热烈行动。“这是好办法。”他决定了，于是立时转告各区：“要一面培养典型作出样子，一面组织群众参观……。”
    铲完头遍苗，“参观评比”已经形成运动了。穿着花衣服的妇女，戴着宽边草帽的农民，坐在三匹马的胶轮大车上，在夏日的草原上飞驰——草原上沸腾起来了。
    “到哪里去呀？”这一辆车上的人们问。
    “县农场参观，”那一辆车上的人们答：“你们哪？”
    “王振堂农业生产合作社！”
    夏锄期间，肇源县委共组织了近八万人到地里参观评比，并重点地组织群众到“间苗、保苗”作得最好的国营农场、农业生产合作社去参观。这就消除了间苗、保苗的阻碍，开展起全县群众性的间苗、保苗运动。各种庄稼实行等距间苗耕作法的达三万多垧，实行补苗的达五千多垧。
    同参观评比结合进行的，还有全县范围的流动红旗竞赛运动。夏天，草原上热闹极了，优胜者高举着他们的红旗下地生产，收工回来，又把红旗高悬在组长门前。草原上，村庄里，到处红旗飘扬，红旗竞赛推动全县胜利地完成了夏锄工作，还在夏锄期间积肥一百余万车。这是肇源农业生产上从来没有过的事情。“吊尔朗当混大荒”，认为地肥不用上粪的老习气，随着新耕作法的推行，随着红旗竞赛，进一步克服了。
    肇源县委会还利用生产的间隙，训练了一万二千名互助组长，一千多名宣传员，三万多名妇女。就是因为他（她）们的带头和发动，使肇源县的爱国丰产运动，形成了遍及全县、贯彻全年的大规模的群众运动。合作互助运动进一步发展和提高了。妇女成为生产中的一支重要力量，夏锄期间，有百分之八十五的妇女参加了间苗工作。就是因为这等等原因，肇源全县在一九五二年获得了空前的丰收。据县人民政府十二月间尚不完全的统计，有一千零七十八个互助组的土地，每垧平均收粮九石；五百六十五个互助组和一百九十四个屯子，四十三个村庄的全部土地，平均每垧收获十石；全县在三百二十一垧的大面积上得到空前的高额产量，每垧收获竟达二十石以上。
    走向新的胜利
    这样大面积的、全县规模的丰收，只是任国栋同志领导爱国丰产运动的一个收获，甚至不是一个重要的收获。他的主要功绩，是找到了在现今条件下迅速提高我国农业生产的途径。他的主要功绩，是给广大干部提供了领导大规模农业建设的一个良好方法。
    半个月后，我向任国栋同志告别时，热烈祝贺他在我国农业建设上的巨大贡献，并预祝他一九五三年获得新的成就时，这位朴素、谦虚的县委书记却说：“我只是按着毛主席的教诲，学着走群众路线。没有党的领导，没有毛主席的教育，我能作出什么来呢？”
    “我们工作中还有两大缺点。一个是新耕作法实行的不平衡、不普遍；一个是实行新耕作法上还有很大的盲目性，不科学，不标准。”任国栋继续说：
    “一九五三年，我们的任务，是在全县每一个村庄，都推行起新耕作法。并按照气候、土壤、不同作物的特性，运用新耕作法。使已经获得高额产量的继续提高，低产量的迅速赶上去。”
    我离开肇源时，县委会已经提出了一九五三年爱国丰产运动的任务和要求。一九五三年，全县十一万八千垧土地的平均单位面积产量，要达到每垧十石，即比一九五二年再提高百分之三十三；要在五千垧土地上，创造每垧万斤的大面积丰产；要使一千个互助组和农业生产合作社、四十个村庄，成为丰产组（社）和丰产村。
    这不只是一个美丽的计划，肇源县委会从秋收时起，已经开始为一九五三年的爱国丰产运动作了一系列的准备工作。现在，不论走进肇源县的哪一个村庄，都会看到一个小型的农业生产展览室。在这个展览室里，有本村最好的庄稼的标本，有关于它的所以得到丰产的详细说明；这个展览室里，也有本村生长最坏的庄稼和它减产原因的说明。这样展览室花钱不多，作用很大。它不仅用新的耕作方法的科学道理教育农民，也用新耕作法的实际效果教育农民。它使农民相信科学，相信自己的力量，具体生动地鼓舞着农民的生产热情，为一九五三年更高涨的爱国丰产运动开辟着道路。
    肇源县委会在其他方面，也作了许许多多的准备工作。就从这许多准备工作上——从正在紧张进行的、广泛深入的农村整党工作上；从整顿互助组和农业生产合作社工作上；从广大农民对新耕作法日益增涨的信任和拥戴上；特别是在任国栋同志亲自领导下，全县各部门、全体干部所作的思想准备、组织准备和物质准备上——可以清楚地看出，肇源县是会实现这个光荣的任务的。我们有根据预祝肇源县在一九五三年获得更高的丰收。有根据预祝任国栋同志获得新的成就。
