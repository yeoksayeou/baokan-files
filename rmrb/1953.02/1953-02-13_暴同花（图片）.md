    XIX. Since Zhang Tongting separated from his wife, his life has been very miserable. Both of his younger sisters have married and left home. The cotton-padded jacket he's wearing hasn't been taken apart and washed for two years. He doesn't know how to cook, whether food is raw or cooked, or how much salt to use. This made him regret even more that he shouldn't have mistreated her in the first place.
    XX. Since the couple understood the Marriage Law, both of them wanted to reconcile, but neither was willing to take the initiative. One day, Zhang Tongting was walking by the fields and saw Guan Yin working, so he voluntarily went to help.
    XXI. Guan Yin is not very old, but he is very sensible. He went back at noon and told his mother about it. His mother told him to bring his father back for dinner that night.
    XXII. Sure enough, Zhang Tongting followed Guan Yin back as it got dark.
    XXIII. Bao Tonghua prepared fried dough cakes and stir-fried dishes to entertain Zhang Tongting well. After Zhang Tongting finished eating, he smoked a pipe and left.
    XXIV. The next day and the day after were the same. On the fourth day, after eating, Zhang Tongting sat on a small stool and kept smoking. Bao Tonghua washed the pot, did the dishes, and fed the pigs, but Zhang Tongting still hadn't left. That night, Zhang Tongting stayed.

    十九、张同廷自从和老婆分家以后，日子过得很狼狈。两个妹子都出了门，自己身上的棉袄穿了二年没有拆过，做饭弄菜不知生熟、盐淡。这就越发后悔当初不该虐待她。
    二十、俩口子自从懂得了婚姻法，双方心里都想和好，就是不好意思先开口。有一天张同廷打地头走过，看到官印在干活，就主动地去帮忙。
    二十一、官印年纪不大，却很懂事。他晌午回去便把这事告诉了他娘。娘叫他晚上领爸爸回来吃晚饭。二十二、傍黑，张同廷果然跟着官印来了。
    二十三、暴同花准备了油馍，炒了菜，好好招待了张同廷，张同廷吃完饭，吸了袋烟，就走了。
    二十四、第二天第三天还是那样。到了第四天吃罢饭，张同廷坐在小板凳上尽吸烟。暴同花涮锅、洗碗、又喂完了猪，张同廷还没有走。这一夜张同廷就住下了。
