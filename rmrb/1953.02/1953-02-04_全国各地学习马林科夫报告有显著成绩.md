According to news from various local newspapers, significant progress has been made across the country in the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) by cadres in service.

First, cadres in various regions are extremely enthusiastic about the study. Under the leadership of senior cadres, general cadres can adhere to the study system, seize the time for self-study, and hold regular discussion meetings. Many cadres have further recognized the importance of theoretical study through this study. For example, Comrade Wang Lizhi, Deputy Secretary of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said: "If we do not improve our theoretical level, it will be difficult to complete the new tasks assigned to us by the Party in the new situation." Comrade Wu Xuansheng, Deputy Secretary of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the CCP, said: "The revolutionary situation is developing rapidly, and it is so dangerous for individuals to stand still!" Cadres in the Liaoxi Provincial Direct Organs fundamentally corrected the past misconception that "studying political theory cannot solve practical work problems" in this study.

Through the study of the first part of the Malenkov Report, many cadres have strengthened their understanding of the current international situation. For example, issues such as the balance of power between the two camps, the two world markets, the two basic economic laws, the development prospects of the two economies, and the inevitability of imperialist war have been more clearly understood than before, thus broadening their horizons and increasing their concern for the world's revolutionary movement, and strengthening their confidence in the struggle of the world's people for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Cadres in the financial and economic and industrial sectors (especially responsible cadres) focused on the second part of the Malenkov Report, paid attention to linking theory with practice, and learned from the advanced experience of Soviet economic construction, achieving the purpose of improving their work. During the study period, the industrial departments of Zhejiang Province, in accordance with the spirit of the document, examined the production plans of fourteen local state-owned and joint state-private industrial and mining enterprises in the province from January to September of last year and found that only four units had completed the plan, and only one of them guaranteed the quality of the products. The Taiyuan Railway Factory found that the reason for the failure to complete the production plan in the third quarter of last year was: insufficient in-depth work, poorly planned plans, and a lack of inspection system. Cadres of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant examined the phenomenon of high scrap rates and a backlog of funds of 50 to 60 billion yuan in the past due to poor administrative and technical management and insufficient overall planning. Through the exposure of these shortcomings, cadres understood more clearly the importance of "the state plan is an active law." In the study, the Shenyang Grain Company, due to its recognition of the importance of the conservation system, eliminated the phenomenon of empty trains due to inaccurate mastery of grain figures.

In studying the third part of the Malenkov Report, many units promoted democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and powerfully exposed bureaucracy. The Northeast Petroleum Industry Administration, in summarizing its work in 1952, used the spirit of the document to launch a democratic inspection from bottom to top and discovered many important problems. The Southwest Taxation Bureau also recently conducted an inspection of the leadership's work in conjunction with the gains from the study, thereby improving the work. Recently, some newspapers in various regions have published study papers written by responsible comrades. These articles can generally link their own business with the spirit of the document, examine the problems in leadership thinking and work, and play a role in promoting practical work.

The strengthening of organizational leadership, the adherence to the study system, and the improvement in study methods are also important gains from the study during this period, creating favorable conditions for carrying out theoretical study in the future. The study of senior cadres in most areas has changed the past laissez-faire state, formally forming study groups, with responsible comrades personally serving as group leaders, formulating strict study disciplines, and adhering to two and a half days of study per week. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the CCP, the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the CCP, and the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the CCP all stipulated that everyone should submit study notes or study papers at the end of the study. The Propaganda Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CCP decided to conduct a selection of model instructors and study models after the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU. The "Study Room" established by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CCP to help political theory teachers improve teaching quality and guide the theoretical study of general cadres often provided instructions on the key points of study, compiled reference materials, and answered difficult questions in the study, playing a certain role in this study. There were many cadres from Liaoxi Province directly under the provincial organs who went to the countryside, so they stipulated that the cadres who went to the countryside should bring study tasks and establish a written reporting system, specifically solving the difficulties in the study of the cadres who went to the countryside. Some organs in the Southwest, Central South, and Shandong implemented a level-by-level guidance system in the study, promoting the theoretical study of middle-level and junior cadres. For example, the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Henan selected some responsible comrades of the Party committee and middle-level cadres with a high theoretical level from various departments to form a study guidance committee to guide the theoretical study of general cadres in service.

According to the situation in various regions, there are still some shortcomings in the study during this period. In terms of linking theory with practice, some units have not yet grasped the spirit of the document very well, and then blindly linked it, so the study often becomes a general work inspection, and even some units completely abandon the document, turning the discussion meeting into a casual talk meeting. In terms of organizational leadership, some regions and units still do not pay enough attention to it, and they still emphasize objective reasons such as being busy with work, so that the study falls into a state of laissez-faire. For example, the senior groups in some units in Sichuan Province and Hubei Province did not adhere to the system in the study and were very scattered; the middle-level groups did not hold a discussion meeting for a long time. In the method of leading the study, some units even adopted coercive orders. For example, the comrades who led the study in the Wengan County Power Plant in Guizhou Province insisted on designating certain comrades to speak at the meeting. Some units indiscriminately labeled and criticized comrades who revealed their true thoughts. All these shortcomings and deviations should be overcome immediately, and attention should be paid to summarizing the learning experience of this period, so that the theoretical study of cadres in the future can develop healthily.

    全国各地学习马林科夫报告有显著成绩
    根据各地报纸消息，目前全国各地在职干部学习联共第十九次代表大会文件，已有显著的成绩。
    首先，各地干部在学习中的热情极高。在高级干部带领下，一般干部都能坚持学习制度，抓紧时间进行自修，定期召开讨论会。许多干部通过这次学习进一步认识了理论学习的重要性。如中共信阳地委会副书记王黎之同志说：“如果再不提高理论水平，就难以完成党在新形势下交给我们的新任务。”中共开封市委会副书记武镟声同志说：“革命形势飞跃发展，个人老是原地踏步，这是多么危险的事呀！”辽西省直属机关干部，在这次学习中从根本上纠正了过去认为“学政治理论不能解决实际工作问题”的错误认识。
    通过马林科夫报告第一部分学习，许多干部加强了对目前国际形势的了解。例如关于两个阵营力量的对比、两个世界市场、两种基本经济法则、两种经济的发展前途及帝国主义战争不可避免等问题，都较前有了明确的认识，从而扩大了眼界，更加关心世界的革命运动，为世界人民争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争增强了信心。
    各财经、工业部门的干部（特别是负责干部）都以马林科夫报告第二部分为重点，注意联系实际，学习苏联经济建设的先进经验，达到了改进工作的目的。浙江省工业部门在学习期间，曾根据文件的精神，检查了全省十四个地方国营及公私合营工矿企业去年一月份至九月份的生产计划，发现只有四个单位完成了计划，而其中只有一个单位保证了产品的质量。太原铁路工厂检查出去年第三季度生产计划没有完成的原因是：工作不深入，计划订得不周到，缺乏检查制度。沈阳机械一厂干部，检查了过去由于行政管理与技术管理差、全面计划性不够而造成废品多及积压资金达五、六十亿元的现象。通过对这些缺点的揭发，使干部比较明确地懂得了“国家的计划就是积极的法律”的重要意义。沈阳粮食公司在学习中由于认识了节约制度的重要性，消灭了因为掌握粮食数字不准确而造成运输上跑空车的现象。
    在学习马林科夫报告的第三部分时，许多单位发扬民主，开展了批评与自我批评，对官僚主义作了有力的揭发。东北石油工业管理局在总结一九五二年工作时，运用文件的精神，展开了自下而上的民主检查，发现了许多重要问题。西南税务管理局机关在最近也结合学习收获，进行一次对领导工作的检查，从而改进了工作。在各地报纸上，最近曾刊登了一些负责同志所写的学习论文，这些文章大都能依据文件精神联系自己的业务，检查了领导思想和工作中的问题，对实际工作起了推动作用。
    组织领导的加强，学习制度的坚持与学习方法上的改进，也是这一时期学习的重要收获，给今后开展理论学习创设了有利的条件。大部分地区高级干部学习已改变了过去的自流状态，正式编成学习组，由负责同志亲任组长，制订了严格的学习纪律，坚持每周两个半天的学习。中共中央华东局、中共中央中南局、中共中央山东分局等都规定学习结束时，每人都要交学习笔记或学习论文。中共甘肃省委宣传部决定在联共第十九次代表大会文件学习结束后，进行一次模范辅导员和学习模范的评选工作。中共黑龙江省委为帮助政治理论教员提高教学质量和辅导一般干部的理论学习而建立的“学习室”，在此次学习中经常指示学习要点，编选参考资料，解答学习中的疑难问题，发挥了一定的作用。辽西省直属机关下乡干部较多，他们即规定了下乡干部要带学习任务，建立书面汇报制度，具体解决了下乡干部学习上的困难。西南、中南和山东的一些机关，实行了学习中的逐级指导制，推动了中级、初级干部的理论学习。如中共河南南阳地委会选拔了一部分党委负责同志和各部门理论水平较高的中级干部，组成学习辅导委员会，对一般在职干部的理论学习进行辅导工作。
    根据各地情况看来，这一时期的学习还存在着一些缺点。在联系实际方面，有的单位对文件精神还没有很好掌握，便去盲目地联系，因此往往使学习变成一般性的工作检查，甚至有的单位完全丢掉文件，使讨论会变成漫谈会。在组织领导方面，有些地区和单位还不够重视，他们还是强调工作忙等客观原因，而使学习陷于自流的状态。如四川省、湖北省有些单位的高级组，在学习中就没有坚持制度，十分散漫；中级组在很长时间中也没有开过一次讨论会。在领导学习的方法上，有的单位竟然采取强迫命令的方式，如贵州瓮安县电厂领导学习的同志，在讨论会上硬指定要某某同志在会上发言。有的单位则对某些暴露真实思想的同志乱扣帽子、乱加批评。所有这些缺点和偏向，应当立即加以克服，并要注意总结这一个时期的学习经验，使今后的干部理论学习健康地发展下去。
