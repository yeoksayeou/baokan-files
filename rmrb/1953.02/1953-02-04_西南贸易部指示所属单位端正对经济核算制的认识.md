    Southwest Trade Department Instructs Subordinate Units to Correct Understanding of Economic Accounting System

    On January 19th, the Southwest Trade Department issued instructions to the commercial bureaus, department stores, and department store purchasing and supply wholesale stations in various provinces, demanding that all localities promptly correct the erroneous understanding of the economic accounting system among cadres in the department store system, strengthen sales promotion, and reduce inventory, so that the state can withdraw a large amount of funds for investment in industrial construction.

    In the process of implementing the economic accounting system in the Southwest region's department store system, due to insufficient ideological mobilization and education, some cadres developed concerns about strict regulations, heavy tasks, and numerous relationships, which led to hesitation in their work. The trade plans formulated by various localities were generally too small when establishing purchasing and supply wholesale stations. According to the plans compiled by various localities, three-quarters of the current goods were listed as surplus commodities. Department stores in various localities only focused on how to achieve their own unit's plans, placing the issue of how to solve the problem of large-scale backlog of materials in the department store system and ensuring market supply in a secondary position, or even not considering it at all. At the same time, leaders at all levels did not pay attention to combining this work with strengthening sales promotion when implementing the economic accounting system this time, and coupled with being busy with internal procedures and system issues, they relaxed sales promotion work. Therefore, since the state-owned department store system in the Southwest region began implementing the economic accounting system, sales have sharply decreased. The sales volume in the first ten days of January this year decreased by more than 46 percent compared with the first ten days of December last year, and the phenomenon of out-of-stock in some commodities occurred in individual areas.

    After discovering the above situation, the Southwest Trade Department immediately issued instructions to the provincial commercial bureaus, provincial department stores, and provincial purchasing and supply wholesale stations. The instructions first required leaders at all levels to strengthen ideological education for cadres, quickly clarify the current confusion, and correct their understanding of the economic accounting system. The instructions pointed out that internal procedures should be handled quickly, but before they are fully completed, sales promotion should be prioritized, and then make up for it. It is currently urgently needed to improve the abnormal phenomenon of commodity backlogs in wholesale stations, out-of-stock in stores, and backlogs in one store while out-of-stock in another store in some areas. The instructions also emphasized that now is the peak season for winter and year-end business, and all localities should seize the opportunity to vigorously promote sales and meet market needs.

    In order to assist various localities in solving the various problems that have occurred in the implementation of the economic accounting system, the Southwest Trade Department has also transferred a large number of cadres to form nine working groups to work in key areas.

### 西南贸易部指示所属单位端正对经济核算制的认识

    西南贸易部指示所属单位端正对经济核算制的认识
    西南贸易部于一月十九日向各省商业厅、百货公司、百货采购供应批发站发出指示，要求各地迅速纠正百货系统干部对实行经济核算制的错误认识，加强推销工作，压缩库存，使国家能抽出大量资金投入工业建设。
    西南区百货系统在实行经济核算制中，由于思想动员与教育工作做得不够，部分干部产生了怕制度严、任务大、关系多的顾虑，以致工作上束手束脚。西南各地在建立采购供应批发站时，制定的贸易计划普遍偏小。根据各地所编计划，把现在货物中的四分之三的商品都列为多余商品。各地百货商店只注意如何实现本单位的计划，把如何解决百货系统物资大量积压的问题和保证市场供应的问题放在次要地位，有的甚至不加考虑。同时各级领导在这次实行经济核算制时，也没有注意把这一工作与加强推销工作结合起来，再加忙于内部手续与制度问题，就放松了推销工作。因此，西南区国营百货系统自开始实行经济核算制后，销货额锐减。今年一月上旬销货额较去年十二月上旬减低百分之四十六以上，个别地区还发生部分商品脱销现象。
    西南贸易部在发现上述情况后，即向各省商业厅、省百货公司、省采购供应批发站发出指示。指示首先要求各级领导加强对干部的思想教育，迅速澄清目前的混乱情况，端正对经济核算制的认识。指示指出，内部手续应赶紧办理，但在还未办理清楚之前，应首先照顾推销，然后再来补办，当前急需改善部分地区存在的批发站商品积压，商店脱销，甲店积压而乙店脱销的反常现象。指示并着重指出，现今正是冬腊商业旺季，各地应抓紧时机大力推销，满足市场需要。
    西南贸易部为协助各地解决在实行经济核算制中所发生的各种问题，还抽调大批干部组成九个工作组分赴各重点地区工作。（新华社）
