    (I)
    The peace movement is a democratic movement uniting international friends to struggle for the maintenance of peace. This movement is related to the interests of people all over the world, and of course also to the interests of our people.

    The peace movement, if calculated from the first World Peace Congress in Paris-Prague in 1949, has a history of more than three years. Through three years of efforts, this international democratic movement has also been continuously developing. In particular, through the recent World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna, the struggle of the people of the world for unity in maintaining peace has had new and great development.

    I am now prepared to present a report to this meeting on the course and achievements of the World People's Peace Congress.

    (II)

    The World People's Peace Congress was decided to be convened by the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in July 1952.

    The World Peace Council saw that the international situation was becoming increasingly tense, and that "the people of many countries are gradually realizing that, whether they like it or not, they are in danger of being dragged step by step into a full-scale war." Therefore, it decided to convene the World People's Peace Congress, calling on people of different political views and different religious beliefs from all over the world to gather as widely as possible to discuss and seek ways to ease international tensions.

    This resolution was enthusiastically supported by the people of the world. Since last July, the people of all countries have actively launched various activities to welcome this great and historically significant meeting. For example, in our capital, Beijing, representatives from 37 countries in Asia, Australia, North and South America held the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and specifically passed a resolution supporting the convening of the World People's Peace Congress; Fifteen European countries held the International Conference for Peaceful Settlement of the German Problem in Berlin; Workers' representatives from five Nordic countries held the Nordic Workers' Peace Conference; Peace representatives from the Middle East, Near East, and North Africa held a peace conference in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon; The Soviet Union and people's democratic countries have successively held national peace conferences… These meetings were all preludes to the World People's Peace Congress, and carried out extensive and in-depth preparatory work for the convening of the World People's Peace Congress.

    Due to the enthusiastic support of the people of the world and the extensive and in-depth separate preparations, the World People's Peace Congress was finally victoriously convened in Vienna on December 12, 1952.

    There were 1,880 representatives from 85 countries attending the meeting. Among them, there were 1,627 official representatives, 102 non-voting delegates, 105 guests, and 46 representatives of international organizations. The representation was very broad. Classified by occupation: 326 workers, 35 farmers, 160 staff members, 75 technicians, 63 business people, 8 athletes, 19 musicians, 189 writers, 20 filmmakers, 56 artists, 157 natural scientists (including doctors), 94 educators, 65 religious figures, 84 lawyers, 92 representatives of national mass organizations, 46 representatives of international organizations, 10 soldiers, 46 politicians, 20 mayors and senators, and 315 others whose details are unknown. Among them, there were 442 women representatives. This grand meeting can truly be called a great gathering of human beings of different races, different classes, different beliefs, and different factions.

    The meeting lasted for eight days and discussed three central issues: (1) National Independence and International Security, (2) Cessation of Current Wars, especially the Korean War, (3) Easing International Tensions. All the representatives conducted free and democratic discussions around these three topics. Eighteen plenary sessions were held in eight days, and the speeches of 188 representatives from 74 countries were listened to. Around the three central topics, three sub-committees were organized separately, and free and democratic discussions were also conducted. We once heard the speeches of representatives of the Vatican, but we continued to hear calm and rational rebuttals. We also heard opinions suspecting the United States of conducting bacteriological warfare, but after discussion, the doubters cancelled their doubts themselves.

    In this way, three resolutions on the three topics were obtained from the three sub-committees respectively, and the Summary Committee crystallized the resolutions of the three sub-committees into two important documents, namely the "Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress" and the "Letter from the World People's Peace Congress to the Governments of the Five Great Powers."

    The two Congress documents and the three sub-committee resolutions (as appendices to the Congress documents) were solemnly read out at the Congress and the consent of all representatives was sought.

    For the sake of special solemnity, both Congress documents were passed by roll-call vote. The method of passing was: after the document was read out at the Congress, it was handed over to the delegations of various countries for discussion and voting. The ballots were printed with the full names of all members of the delegations, followed by columns for "Agree," "Oppose," "Abstain," and "Signature." The participants in the vote, depending on whether they agreed, opposed, or abstained, only needed to mark the appropriate column and then sign their names. The collected votes were then formally announced at the Congress.

    This method is very simple, but it is also very democratic. The results obtained through this procedure are: 1,647 people participated in the vote (because some representatives left Vienna before the closing ceremony). 1,626 people voted in favor of the "Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress"; ten people abstained, all of whom were non-voting delegates and guests; eleven people did not vote, all of whom were non-voting delegates. 1,637 people voted in favor of the "Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers"; seven people abstained, all of whom were non-voting delegates and guests; three people did not vote, all of whom were non-voting delegates.

    In this way, the important documents of the Congress were passed by roll-call vote without a single vote against, and all the official representatives voted in favor.

    The meeting closed victoriously at 3:00 a.m. on December 20. At the closing ceremony, all attendees, upstairs and downstairs, stood up unanimously, cheered enthusiastically, applauded enthusiastically, embraced enthusiastically, kissed enthusiastically, sang enthusiastically, held hands, formed a chain, raised them simultaneously, lowered them simultaneously, and swayed from side to side simultaneously. The entire venue turned into an ocean of joy. This situation continued for about twenty minutes.

    (III)

    One of the main tasks of the peace movement is to win over the broad masses of peace-loving people to fight for the maintenance of peace. The wider the base of the movement, the more isolated the warmongers of the aggressive camp will be, and therefore the more likely it will be to stop their conspiracy to launch a new world war. The congress was very successful from this point of view. Among the 1,880 representatives participating in the congress, who represented a very wide range of people, there were people who had been engaged in the peace movement for a long time, and there were also about 400 people who had never participated in the peace movement, some of whom were quite distant from the peace movement.

    For example, taking the British delegation as an example. Fifty of the 153 representatives were members of the Labour Party, and there were also many trade union representatives affiliated to the Labour Party and ten priests.

    The broad representation of the delegation shows that the peace movement has been widely and deeply developed among the people of all countries during the preparatory period of the congress. Just as the countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, such as India and Japan, fully developed the peace movement during the preparatory period, the Western European countries participating in the World People's Peace Congress also had the same situation.

    Taking the Italian delegation as an example. The Gasperi government of Italy is hostile to the peace movement, and like other governments of the same nature, it has done everything possible to obstruct the World People's Peace Congress, even closing the border as if facing a formidable enemy. Although a thousand people in Italy were prepared to participate in the peace demonstration parade of Vienna citizens, and were therefore unable to do so, a delegation of 198 people still attended, which was the largest delegation of all countries.

    Due to the in-depth and widespread nature of the movement, the policy of obliterating the peace movement by the reactionary newspapers of various countries was broken. The bourgeois newspapers of Western European countries have always ignored the news of the peace movement, but because the peace movement is already a matter of concern to the masses of the people, in order to win over customers, they have had to lift their blockade and publish news of the congress in considerable detail.

    The expansion of the base of the peace movement is vividly manifested in the peace demonstration parade of Vienna citizens. At 3:00 p.m. on the second day of the opening of the Congress, Vienna citizens held a very grand demonstration parade to celebrate the convening of the Congress. The demonstrators were mostly workers, farmers, students, housewives, teenagers, disabled soldiers, business representatives, fathers carrying infants on their shoulders, mothers holding babies in their arms, holding "peace" banners in various languages, shouting "peace" slogans in various languages, enthusiastically welcoming the peace envoys of the people of all countries, and forming a mighty torrent of people, flowing from Stalin Square in front of the Parliament Building, flowing from 3:00 p.m. to evening. Torches were lit, forming a sea of light.

    This scene was once seen at the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council in November 1951, but this time it was even more grand and enthusiastic. This made Giuseppe Nitti, a member of parliament from the Italian Liberal Party who participated in the world-scale peace movement for the first time, very moved when he spoke at the congress: "People often say that such a large demonstration parade can only be held in communist countries or countries where the Communist Party is strong. Vienna does not belong to this category. The enthusiastic masses automatically gathered to march, proclaiming the right of life to overcome destruction and death. This torrent of people is becoming more and more powerful and more and more irresistible in all countries. Governments must listen to us, because we will soon be more powerful than them." The reaction of newcomers to new things is indeed very vivid and true.

    Undoubtedly, the convening of the World People's Peace Congress has further expanded the broad base of the peace movement on a global scale.

    (IV)

    From the point of view of exposing the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers, the achievements of the congress are equally significant.

    The imperialist aggressive bloc, especially U.S. imperialism, in order to obtain maximum profits, vainly attempts to obtain world hegemony. They are frantically implementing an aggressive policy of expanding their military and preparing for war; and continuing to maintain a brutal war of aggression in Asia. They constantly conclude enslaving treaties and war alliances that trample on the independence and sovereignty of other countries and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, establish military bases everywhere, search for cannon fodder everywhere, support reactionary forces everywhere, suppress the people, and arbitrarily carry out blockades, embargoes, monopolies, and monopolization. In the Korean War, U.S. imperialists have unscrupulously used large-scale destructive bacteriological and chemical weapons, fearing that the success of the armistice negotiations will promote the easing of tensions, and are doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage them, in an attempt to prolong and expand the existing war.

    We do not need to say that we directly experience this extremely tyrannical act of aggression. However, the extremely shameless aggressors will never say that they are carrying out aggression or preparing for aggression, but that others are carrying out aggression or preparing for aggression, and that they are carrying out "defense." U.S. imperialist aggressors often extremely shamelessly call the places where they have the freedom to rule and the freedom to invade something called the "free world," and often shout about what "the free world is threatened by communist aggression," and slander the Soviet Union, which has always adhered to a policy of peace, as an "aggressor" and China as an "aggressor" in Korea. They reverse black and white to embellish themselves and tell a big lie to deceive the people of the world. What they hope is that the people of the world will be caught in their big lie, so that they can smoothly implement their policy of aggressive war.

    Therefore, constantly exposing the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers is another important task of the peace movement.

    In this congress, through the democratic discussion of the three central topics, the root cause of international tensions was indeed clarified. This root cause is the policy of aggressive war of the U.S. ruling clique in pursuit of maximum profits. The upsurge of sentiment against U.S. aggressive war policies was a major feature of this congress. At the congress, we constantly heard representatives from North and South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Near East, North Africa, and Western Europe, like waves, successively accusing the impact of U.S. aggressive policies. They unanimously demanded respect for national independence, the immediate cessation of current wars, and the rapid restoration of normal trade and cultural exchanges. The wolf in sheep's clothing was ruthlessly stripped naked again.

    The warmongers are accustomed to reversing black and white, and they will never forget to slander the peace movement, which directly opposes the war policy. They often say with their eyes closed that the peace movement is a movement manipulated behind the scenes by the Communist Party or communist countries. After this congress, such rumors will lose their effect even more. Since the representation of the representatives is so broad, the discussion is so free, and especially the way of voting by roll call is so democratic, all of these fully show that the peace movement is not the movement of any one party, but an extremely broad international democratic movement. It is deeply rooted in the deep desire for peace of the people of the world. Although the rumor-mongers will continue to spread rumors, the market for rumors has shrunk.

    (V)

    The biggest gain of the congress is undoubtedly the formulation of a common program of action for the current peace movement. This is clearly recorded in the "Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress." As a necessary step to ease the current international tensions, the following important appeals and demands are put forward here:

    1.  Request the governments of the five great powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France, to immediately begin consultations to conclude a peace treaty;
    2.  Request the immediate cessation of all hostilities in Korea;
    3.  Request the immediate cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaya;
    4.  Respect the desire of the people of all countries for national independence, and end the phenomenon of one country threatening the national security of other countries;
    5.  Suggest peaceful solutions to the German and Japanese problems, and reopen negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty and conclude a treaty;
    6.  Request the immediate prohibition of bacteriological warfare, and the absolute prohibition of atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and other instruments of extermination of civilians;
    7.  Advocate the immediate start of negotiations on disarmament—under effective international supervision, comprehensive, simultaneous, gradual, and proportionate disarmament should be carried out;
    8.  Advocate the speedy restoration of material and cultural exchanges between countries;
    9.  Advocate inviting the People's Republic of China and other fourteen countries to join the United Nations;
    10. Advocate that the United Nations once again become a place for governments to seek agreements.

    These historic demands have once again been proven to be the common and urgent wishes of the people of the world.

    Among the above demands, there are several that have special significance, and I would like to briefly explain them here.

    The first is the request for the five great powers to conclude a peace treaty. This was originally a call issued by the Berlin meeting of the World Peace Council in February 1951. Countries all over the world have already held signature campaigns, and more than 600 million people have signed, and more than 344 million people have signed in our country.

    This request was re-proposed at this congress, and there is a slight difference in nature. The previous call was: the five major powers should take the lead in launching the conclusion of a peace treaty, "welcoming all countries to participate." This time the request is specifically to instruct the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty. Of course, this is not to belittle countries other than the five major powers, but to increase the responsibility on the shoulders of the five major powers. Because they do "determine the fate of world peace to a very large extent."

    The conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers is the core suggestion of this congress. In order to promote the realization of this suggestion, the congress separately passed the "Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers," and also organized a negotiating committee composed of representatives of several countries, responsible for delivering the resolution to the governments of the five great powers. Our Chinese delegation has elected Ma Yinchu and Shen Yanbing as representatives to participate in this committee.

    As the "Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers" says: "An agreement reached by the five major powers and the conclusion of a peace treaty will eliminate international tensions and save the world from disaster."

    This is the common demand of the people all over the world, but it is also a test of the sincerity of peace. There is no problem for the Chinese and Soviet governments, because the governments and people of these two countries have long expressed their welcome to the conclusion of a peace treaty. The problem has always been with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. They often use "peace" as a cover. This simple and straightforward request can once again test their true intentions in front of the people of the world.

    The second is the request to immediately stop the current war, especially the Korean War. This simple request reflects the universal desire of the vast majority of mankind in the world today, and is a clear and positive protest against the war policy of the aggressive bloc, especially U.S. imperialism. The aggressive bloc does not want to stop the war at all, especially U.S. imperialism, which is still continuing the war of aggression in Korea, continuing to use bacteriological warfare, and constantly intruding into our country's northeastern airspace, carrying out strategic reconnaissance. In a word, U.S. imperialism is still attempting to expand the war. To ease the international situation and achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean problem, the immediate cessation of the Korean War is the primary step. The people of the world putting forward the demand for an immediate ceasefire on the front side shows their firm opposition to the war policy of U.S. imperialism and their desire to achieve peace.

    The third is the request to immediately ban bacteriological warfare. It was not easy for this request to be written into a resolution and unanimously passed. U.S. imperialists have been using bacteriological weapons since New Year's Day last year, and it has been more than a year. Despite the continuous solemn protests of the people of China and North Korea, the continuous just appeals of world-renowned figures and international organizations, and the publication of detailed investigation reports by the international committee composed of European and American scientists, many scientists in Western European countries still hold a skeptical attitude due to the deception and blockade of the U.S. government and its servants. However, as a result of free discussion at this congress, all the official representatives finally understood the actual situation, admitted this fact, and were deeply moved and demanded an immediate ban. The representatives of Britain, France, the United States, and other countries showed their noble sense of justice here. The congress had 157 natural scientists and 84 legal experts participating. The resolution produced by such a congress clearly shows that the crime of U.S. imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare is an ironclad case.

    Therefore, we can say that the resolution to ban bacteriological warfare is an outstanding achievement of this congress, and at the same time, it is another victory for the people of China and North Korea on the front line against bacteriological warfare.

    (VI)

    The Chinese delegation participated in this congress under the leadership of the head of the delegation, Soong Ching Ling. Our delegation had a total of 59 representatives, including representatives from people's organizations, democratic parties, religious circles, education circles, business circles, writers, artists, musicians, scientific workers, journalists, youth, women, and ethnic minorities. We faithfully carried out the entrustment of the people of the whole country to us, and expressed the warm desire and firm will of the Chinese people to maintain peace inside and outside the congress.

    We maintained close unity with the delegations of various countries participating in the congress. The peace fighters of China and Asian countries have established a deeper friendship through this congress. The speeches and suggestions of the Indian delegation on the issue of stopping the Korean War are worth special mention. They also advocated that the Korean War should be stopped immediately, all prisoners of war should be repatriated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, an international commission should be organized to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and foreign troops should be withdrawn. From this, it can be seen that even the Indian people themselves cannot agree to the Indian proposal on the Korean issue that was illegally passed by the United Nations General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States.

    (VII)

    The World People's Peace Congress was indeed a successful meeting of historical significance. It expressed the common will of the people of the world to strive for peace and oppose aggression, stipulated the correct direction of the peace movement, and also reviewed the overall achievements of the peace movement in the past three years, and held a grand peace demonstration against the warmongers of the imperialist aggressive bloc. This congress marks that the peace movement has entered a new stage of development.

    This is the result of the joint efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, and the result of the joint efforts of 1,880 representatives from 85 countries.

    The development of the scale of the peace movement shows the further unity of the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, and at the same time shows that our friends are all over the world.

    We have a responsibility to take the necessary steps to implement the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress. This can not only protect the interests of the people all over the world, but also protect the interests of the people of our country.

    As long as we make unremitting efforts, the democratic movement that unites international friends to fight for the maintenance of peace is bound to win the final victory.

    关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告
    ——一九五三年二月四日在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的报告
    郭沫若
    （一）
    和平运动是团结国际友人为维护和平而斗争的民主运动。这个运动是关系全世界人民的利益的，当然也关系我国人民的利益。
    和平运动，假使从一九四九年巴黎——布拉格第一届世界保卫和平大会起算，已经有三年多的历史了。经过三年的努力，这一国际民主运动也有了不断的展开。特别是经过最近在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，世界人民为维护和平而团结一致的斗争更有了新的巨大的发展。
    我现在准备把世界人民和平大会的经过和成就向本次会议提出报告。
    （二）
    世界人民和平大会是一九五二年七月世界和平理事会柏林特别会议所决议召开的。
    世界和平理事会看到国际局势的日益紧张，“许多国家的人民逐渐认识到：不管他们愿不愿意，他们有被一步步地拖入全面战争的危险”，因此决定召开世界人民和平大会，号召世界各国不同政治见解、不同宗教信仰的人们，尽量广泛地集合起来，进行讨论，寻求缓和国际紧张局势的办法。
    这一决议获得世界人民的热烈拥护，自去年七月以来，世界各国人民都积极展开了各种活动，来迎接这个伟大的有历史意义的会议。例如在我们的首都北京，亚洲、澳洲、南北美洲三十七个国家的代表举行过亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并特别通过了一项决议拥护世界人民和平大会的召开；欧洲十五个国家在柏林举行过国际争取和平解决德国问题会议；北欧五个国家的工人代表举行过北欧工人和平会议；中东、近东、北非各国和平代表在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行过和平会议；苏联及人民民主国家都先后举行过全国保卫和平大会……这些会议都是世界人民和平大会的前奏，为世界人民和平大会的召开进行了广泛而深入的准备工作。
    由于世界各国人民的热烈支持和广泛而深入的分头准备，世界人民和平大会终于一九五二年十二月十二日在维也纳胜利地召开了。
    到会国家八十五个，代表一千八百八十名。这里面正式代表一千六百二十七名，列席代表一百零二名，来宾一百零五名，国际组织代表四十六名。代表性是非常广泛的，以职业分类来说：工人三百二十六人，农民三十五人，职员一百六十人，技术人员七十五人，工商界六十三人，体育运动家八人，音乐界十九人，文学界一百八十九人，电影界二十人，艺术家五十六人，自然科学界（包含医生）一百五十七人，教育界九十四人，宗教界六十五人，法律界八十四人，全国性群众团体代表九十二人，国际组织代表四十六人，军人十人，政治界四十六人，市长和参议员二十人，其他不详者三百一十五人。这里面妇女代表是四百四十二名。这一盛大的会议，真可以说是不同种族、不同阶层、不同信仰、不同派别的人类大集会。
    会议进行了八天，讨论了三个中心问题：（一）关于民族独立与国际安全，（二）关于停止现行战争，首先是朝鲜战争，（三）关于缓和国际紧张局势。全体代表围绕着这三个议题进行了自由的民主的讨论，在八天之中举行了十八次大会，听取了七十四个国家，一百八十八位代表的发言。围绕着三个中心议题，更分别组织了三个小组委员会，同样进行了自由的民主的讨论。我们曾经听到代表梵蒂冈教廷的言论，但也继续听到心平气和的尽情尽理的辩驳。我们也曾经听到怀疑美国进行细菌战的意见，但经过讨论的结果，怀疑者把怀疑自行取消了。
    就这样，从三个小组委员会分别得到了三项议题的决议，更由综合委员会把三个小组委员会的决议提要鉤玄地结晶成为两个重要的文件，即“世界人民和平大会宣言”和“世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书”。
    两个大会文件和三个小组委员会决议（作为大会文件的附件）都在大会上郑重宣读，征求了全体代表的同意。
    为了特别郑重起见，两个大会文件都是用记名投票的方式通过的。通过的方式是：文件在大会宣读后，再交由各国代表团分别讨论，进行投票。票面印就了各国代表团的全体姓名，姓名之次有赞成栏、反对栏、弃权栏、签名栏。参加投票者看你赞成、反对或弃权，只须在相当栏内画下符号，再签上自己的姓名。投票集中起来，所得到的结果再在大会上正式宣布。
    这方式是很简单的，但也是十分民主的。经过这样的程序所得到的结果是：参加投票者一千六百四十七人（因为有的代表未等闭幕先行离开了维也纳）。赞成“世界人民和平大会宣言”者一千六百二十六人；弃权者十人，都是列席代表和来宾；不投票者十一人，都是列席代表。赞成“致五大国政府书”者一千六百三十七人；弃权者七人，都是列席代表和来宾；不投票者三人，都是列席代表。
    就这样，两个大会的重要文件经过记名投票的结果没有一票反对，而所有的正式代表都投了赞成票。
    会议在十二月二十日清早三时胜利闭幕了。闭幕时全体到会者，楼上楼下，一致起立，热烈欢呼，热烈鼓掌，热烈拥抱，热烈亲吻，热烈歌唱，手牵着手，结成连环，同时举起，同时放下，同时向左右波动。会场全体化成了一个欢乐的海洋。这样的情形继续了有二十分钟的光景。
    （三）
    和平运动的主要任务之一是要争取广大的爱好和平的人民为维护和平而奋斗。运动的基础愈扩大，侵略阵营的好战分子便愈孤立，因而便愈有可能制止他们发动新的世界战争的阴谋。这一次的大会从这一角度来说是很有成就的。参加大会的代表性极其广泛的一千八百八十名代表中，有长期从事和平运动的人士，也有四百名左右是不曾参加过和平运动的人，其中有少数与和平运动是颇有距离的。
    如以英国代表团为例。一百五十三名代表中，工党党员占五十名，此外还有不少的工党所属的工会代表和十名神甫。
    代表团代表性的广泛，是表明在大会筹备期中已经把和平运动广泛而深入地向各国人民群众中展开了。就如参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国，如印度，如日本，在筹备期中把和平运动充分展开了的一样，参加世界人民和平大会的西欧各国也有同样的情形。
    再以意大利代表团为例。意大利的加斯贝利政府是仇视和平运动的，和其它国家同性质的政府一样，极尽了对于世界人民和平大会阻挠的能事，甚至如临大敌地把国境封锁了。意大利本有一千人的群众准备参加维也纳市民的和平示威大游行的，虽然因而没有可能达到，但依然有一百九十八人所组成的代表团出席，是各国代表团中最大的一个。
    由于运动的深入而普及，因而打破了各国反动派报纸的抹杀政策。西欧各国的资产阶级的报纸对于和平运动的消息一向是不加理会的，但因为和平运动已经是人民大众所关心的事，为了争取主顾，他们也就不能不解除自己的封锁，而以相当大的篇幅来登载大会的消息了。
    和平运动的基础的扩大，生动地表现在维也纳市民的和平示威大游行上。大会开幕的第二天下午三时，维也纳市民为庆祝大会的召开，举行了一次很盛大的示威游行。游行者多是工人、农民、学生、家庭妇女、少年儿童、残废军人、工商界代表、肩上荷着幼儿的父亲、怀里抱着婴儿的母亲、打着各种不同文字的“和平”标语牌，喊着各种不同语言的“和平”口号，热烈地欢迎着各国人民的和平使者，浩浩荡荡地形成人的洪流，从国会大厦前的斯大林广场上流过，从三时流到傍晚。火炬燃起来了，成了一片光海。
    这个光景，在一九五一年十一月世界和平理事会维也纳会议时是曾经看见过的，但这次是更加壮大而热烈了。这使得第一次参加世界规模的和平运动的意大利自由党的国会议员朱塞佩·尼蒂，在大会上发言时很感动地说：“常常听人说，这样大的示威游行只能在共产主义的国家或共产党强大的国家才能有。维也纳不属于这个范畴。热情的群众自动地集合起来游行，宣告着生命克服破坏和死亡的权利。这人的洪流在一切国家里是愈来愈有力，愈来愈不可抗。各国政府必须倾听我们，因为我们很快就会比它们更有力量。”新来人接触到新鲜事物，所生出的反映确实是很生动而真切的。
    无疑，世界人民和平大会的召开是在全世界范围内把和平运动的广泛基础更加扩大了。
    （四）
    再从揭露战争贩子们的欺骗宣传来说，大会的成就也是同样显著的。
    帝国主义侵略集团，特别是美帝国主义，为了获得最大利润，妄想取得世界霸权，它们疯狂地执行着扩军备战的侵略政策；并在亚洲继续维持着残酷的侵略战争。它们不断缔结蹂躏别国独立主权、干涉别国内政的奴役条约和战争同盟，到处建立军事基地、搜罗炮灰，到处扶植反动势力、镇压人民，任意进行封锁禁运、独占垄断。在朝鲜战争中，美帝国主义者已肆无忌惮地使用大规模毁灭性的细菌武器与化学武器，深恐停战谈判成功而促成紧张局势的缓和，更百般地加以阻挠和破坏，以图延长并扩大现有的战争。
    这极端横暴的侵略罪行，在我们不用说是直接体会着的。然而极端无耻的侵略者，决不会说自己在进行侵略或准备侵略，而是说别人在进行侵略或准备侵略，自己是在进行“防卫”。美帝国主义侵略者经常极端无耻地把在它有统治的自由和有侵略的自由地方叫做甚么“自由世界”，并经常在叫嚣着甚么“自由世界受着共产主义侵略的威胁”，诬蔑一贯坚持着和平政策的苏联是“侵略者”、中国是在朝鲜的“侵略者”，这样颠倒黑白地粉饰自己，扯下弥天大谎来欺骗世界人民。他们所希望的是世界人民被网罗在他们的弥天大谎里，那样便可以顺利地执行他们的侵略战争政策了。
    因此，不断揭露战争贩子们的欺骗宣传，是和平运动的又一重要任务。
    在这一次的大会中，通过三个中心议题的民主讨论，确实是把国际紧张局势的总根源阐明了。这个总根源就是追求最大利润的美国统治集团的侵略战争政策。抗议美国侵略战争政策的情绪高涨是这次大会的一大特色。在大会上我们不断听到了南北美洲、东南亚、中东、近东、北非以及西欧各国的代表，像波澜一样，接连控诉着美国侵略政策的影响。他们一致要求民族独立的尊重，现行战争的立即停止，正常的贸易与文化交流的迅速恢复。野心狼身上的羊皮被无情地又剥夺了一次。
    战争贩子们是惯会颠倒黑白的，他们对于直接反对战争政策的和平运动，因而也决不会忘记要加以诬蔑。他们经常闭着眼睛说：和平运动是共产党或共产主义国家在后面所操纵的运动。经过这一次会议，这样的谣言也更要失掉作用了。代表们的代表性既然那么广泛，讨论的进行又那么自由，特别是用记名投票进行表决的方式更那么民主，这些都充分地表示着和平运动不是那一个党派的，而是极其广泛的国际民主运动。它是深深地植根在世界人民的深切的和平愿望里面的。尽管造谣者依然还会继续造谣，然而谣言的市场是已经缩小了。

    大会的最大收获，无疑是为当前的和平运动制订了共同的行动纲领。这是明确地纪录在“世界人民和平大会宣言”里面的。作为缓和当前的国际紧张局势的必要步骤，在这里提出了如下重要的呼吁和要求：
    一、要求美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国、法国五大国政府
        ，立即开始协商缔结和平公约；
    二、要求立即停止在朝鲜的一切敌对行动；
    三、要求立即停止在越南、高棉、寮国和马来亚的敌对行动；
    四、尊重各国人民的民族独立的愿望，结束一国威胁他国的国家
        安全的现象；
    五、建议和平解决德、日问题，并重开关于对奥和约的谈判，缔
        结和约；
    六、要求立刻禁止细菌战，并绝对禁止原子武器、化学武器及其
        他灭绝平民的工具；
    七、主张立刻开始裁减军备的谈判——在有效的国际监督之下，
        进行全面的、同时的、逐步的、按比例的裁军；
    八、主张尽速恢复各国之间的物质与文化的交流；
    九、主张邀请中华人民共和国与其它十四个国家加入联合国；
    十、主张联合国再度成为各国政府谋取协议的地方。
    这些历史性的要求，又一次被证明了是世界人民共同的迫切愿望。
    上述各项要求中，有几项含有特殊意义的，我想在这里略略加以说明。
    首先是五大国缔结和平公约的要求。这本来是一九五一年二月世界和平理事会柏林会议所发出的号召，全世界各国大都已经举行过签名运动，世界人民已经有六亿以上的人签名，我国的签名者在三亿四千四百万以上。
    这个要求，在这一次大会上又重新提出，在性质上是略有差别的。以前的号召是：由五大国带头发动和平公约的缔结，“欢迎所有的国家参加”。这一次的要求是专门责成五大国缔结和平公约。当然，这并不是轻视了五大国以外的国家，而是把责任加重在五大国肩头上了。因为他们的确是“在非常大的程度上决定全世界和平命运”的。
    五大国缔结和平公约，是这次大会的核心建议。为了促成这一建议的实现，大会既另行通过了“致五大国政府书”，同时还组织了由若干国家代表所构成的一个交涉委员会，负责向五大国政府递交决议书。我们中国代表团已经推选了马寅初和沈雁冰二位代表参加这个委员会。
    诚如“致五大国政府书”中所说：“五大国取得协议、缔结和平公约，就将消除国际紧张局势，拯救世界免于浩劫”。
    这是全世界人民的共同要求，但也是对于和平诚意的一个考验。中苏两国政府是毫无问题的，因为这两国的政府和人民早就表示了欢迎和平公约的缔结。问题始终是在美、英、法三国政府方面。它们经常在以“和平”为幌子。这个简捷了当的要求，在世界人民面前，可以又一次检验出它们的真意。
    其次是立即停止现行战争、首先是朝鲜战争的要求。这个简单的要求，反映了今天全世界最大多数人类的普遍愿望，对于侵略集团，特别是美帝国主义的战争政策，是一个明确的正面抗议。侵略集团是根本不想停战的，特别是美帝国主义，还在朝鲜继续进行侵略战争、继续使用细菌战，并不断侵入我国东北领空，进行战略侦察，一句话，美帝国主义还企图扩大战争。要缓和国际局势，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决，立即停止朝鲜战争实为首要步骤。世界人民正面地提出立即停战的要求，表明了对于美帝国主义的战争政策的坚决反对及对实现和平的渴望。
    再其次是立即禁止细菌战的要求。这个要求能写成决议，并获得一致通过，是很不容易的。美帝国主义者自从去年元旦开始使用细菌武器以来，已经一年多了。尽管中朝两国人民不断提出严正抗议、世界知名人士与国际组织不断发出正义呼吁，欧美科学家所组成的国际委员会更已经公布了详细的调查报告，但由于美国政府及其仆从们的欺骗和封锁，西欧各国的许多科学家还抱着怀疑的态度。但在这一次大会上经过自由讨论的结果，全体正式代表终于明了了实际情况，承认了这个事实，并深受感动而要求立刻禁止了。英、法、美等国的代表，在这里表现了他们的高尚的正义感。大会有一百五十七位自然科学家和八十四位法律专家参加，由这样的大会所产生的决议，明确地表明美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪恶是铁案难移了。
    因此，我们可以说：禁止细菌战的决议是这次大会的一项特出的成就，同时也就是中朝两国人民在反抗细菌战战线上的又一次胜利。

    中国代表团在宋庆龄团长领导之下参加了这次大会。我们的代表团共有代表五十九人，包含人民团体、民主党派、宗教界、教育界、工商界、文学家、艺术家、音乐家、科学工作者、新闻工作者、青年、妇女、少数民族，各方面的代表人物。我们忠实地执行了全国人民对于我们的委托，在大会内外表达了中国人民维护和平的热烈愿望和坚决意志。
    我们和参加大会的各国代表团都保持了亲密的团结。中国和亚洲各国的和平战士们，经过这次大会，建立了更深厚的友谊。印度代表团在停止朝鲜战争的问题上的发言和建议，值得特别提及。他们和我们同样主张：立即停止朝鲜战争，依据日内瓦公约全部遣返战俘，组织国际委员会和平解决朝鲜问题，撤退外国军队。由此可见，在美国操纵下联合国大会所非法通过的关于朝鲜问题的印度提案，就是印度人民自己也是不能同意的。
    （七）
    世界人民和平大会的确是一个有历史意义的成功的会议。它表达了世界人民争取和平、反对侵略的共同意志，规定了和平运动的正确方针，同时也检查了三年来和平运动的总成绩，向帝国主义侵略集团的战争贩子们举行了一次声势宏壮的和平示威。这次大会标志着和平运动进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    这是全世界爱好和平的人民共同努力的成果，是八十五个国家一千八百八十位代表共同努力的成果。
    和平运动的规模的发展，说明了全世界各国爱好和平的人民的进一步的团结，同时也即说明了我们的朋友遍于全世界。
    我们有责任，采取必要的步骤，来实现世界人民和平大会的各项决议。这不仅可以保障全世界人民
    的利益，同时也可以保障我国人民的利益。
    只要我们努力不懈，团结国际友人为维护和平而斗争的民主运动是必然获得最后胜利的。
