Having participated in the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna, I have gained a deeper understanding of the firm determination and great strength of the people of the world in defending peace.

Seven years have passed since the end of World War II, but the Austrian people still live in poverty and insecurity. Vienna, once renowned for its music and drama, is now in decline and dimmed. The dust-covered statue of Beethoven, standing tall in the street, seems to express infinite indignation in the face of dilapidated walls. The famous opera house, supported by wooden frames on all sides, has been under repair for three or four years but remains unfinished, illustrating the fate that this city of culture and art is suffering.

Following the US, British, and French imperialist blocs, the reactionary Austrian government faithfully carries out its masters' Cold War policy, accelerates war preparations, and oppresses the people. The people of Vienna live under the constant threat of unemployment and economic depression. Many famous musicians, driven by hunger and cold, have changed careers or fled to other countries. I went to a music store to buy a bow for my son's violin, and the price was very expensive. According to the store clerk, there were originally not many workers making this special handicraft, and after the war, due to business depression, production became even less, and the price went up. A high-quality "bow" almost cost as much as a violin used to sell for. This is a small matter, but it shows how terribly Vienna's culture and art have declined. Although the windows of ordinary shops on the streets of Vienna are beautifully decorated, there are few customers, presenting a scene of desolation. Later, we bought things at the Moscow department store, and the places for export and import were crowded with people like a tide, and the inside was even more crowded. The goods were also very abundant, and we could choose and buy freely without any restrictions. The contrast between the two further highlighted the affluence of the people's lives in socialist countries and the decline of the old capitalist world.

This conference had a wider representation and a larger number of participants than the previous two World Peace Congresses. There were three hundred representatives of cultural and artistic workers alone, accounting for about one-fifth of the total number of delegates. During the conference, a German female comrade who worked in the arts approached me to talk about the new achievements of new China's drama and the living conditions of the performers after liberation, and I told her everything. Finally, she asked me how I felt about participating in the Peace Congress. I said, "As a literary and art worker in new China, I am a fervent lover of peace. Participating in this conference has made me feel even more responsible. I will work harder in the future to use the weapon of opera art to strengthen the promotion of peace."

When the conference successfully concluded, all the representatives shouted "Long live peace" in various languages, sang, and embraced each other. Handkerchiefs and paper flowers fluttered all over the place. The mercury lamps for filming shone as brightly as day. An old white-haired lady stood on a chair, clapping her hands and stamping her feet, excitedly shedding tears and saying, "I will never forget this World People's Peace Congress." Her husband and daughter had both been sacrificed in World War II.

After the conclusion of the conference, our Chinese representatives were warmly received by the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association and visited Moscow and Leningrad for twelve days. I participated in three joint parties held by the Soviet art community. In 1935, I and my troupe went to the Soviet Union to perform. Returning to the old place after seventeen years made me feel particularly happy. At that time, the Soviet Union was still a socialist country that was just growing up, but today, it has already begun to move towards communism. We visited the large-scale ball bearing factory in Moscow and the affiliated nurseries, hospitals, and cultural centers. The products of this factory not only supply the entire Soviet Union but can also supply the needs of brother countries. We also visited the largest university in the world—Moscow University, which has a total of 40,000 rooms. Someone calculated that if a child were born and lived in each room for one day, it would take 106 years to live in all of them. The last time I went to the Soviet Union, the subway was just beginning to be built, and many Soviet young men and women participated in the labor. Some members of our troupe were also invited to visit the test drive. This time we visited again, and the scale of the subway was even larger, with many newly built stations, resplendent and clean. The walls depict heroic figures admired by the Soviet people and are decorated with sculptures of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Several designers and builders of the stations have received Stalin Prizes. The cars move underground, operated by electricity, with good air circulation and bright lights. Two million passengers are transported every day. Some passengers read newspapers and magazines in the cars, and some female comrades knit woolen clothes in the cars.

On Gorky Street, which has a strong cultural atmosphere, there are many bookstores and music stores. Years ago, I used to walk here and saw old and small houses, but now they have all been replaced by tall buildings. I thought that in the past seventeen years, if there had not been the arduous years of the Patriotic War, who knows what amazing changes there would have been.

In the Soviet Union, we also watched ballet, opera, dance, music, and the Grand Circus. Some of the programs they performed were classical and some were new, and they all made a deep impression on people. At the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, I saw a light opera "Beside the Village" performed by the Pyatnitsky Russian Folk Choir (one of the four national song and dance choirs). It was composed of more than twenty kinds of folk songs and ethnic dances, but the whole atmosphere was very harmonious.

In the performance of the Grand Circus, there was an interesting program interspersed: A clown was a painter, and he opened a scroll on the spot with a cow with a very long neck painted on it. Another clown asked him, "How can there be a cow with such a long neck?" He said humorously, "This cow grows in America and eats grass in Europe." As soon as he finished speaking, the whole audience laughed because everyone knew that American imperialism was trying to rule the world, and the governments of European countries such as Britain and France had become its servants. This performance was a powerful satire.

On December 30, 1952, comrades from the Soviet art community welcomed us to the "Actors' Home" to participate in a joint party. I performed the "Thinking of the Mortal World" and the sword dance from "Farewell My Concubine." Comrade Chang Xiangyu performed a section from "Hong Niang" and "Hua Mulan." Outstanding Soviet People's Artists performed wonderful singing and dancing programs. Professor Barsova, a famous musician, gave the opening speech. After the end of the show, many People's Artists went on stage to present flowers. Comrade Cherkasov gave a speech. This party fully demonstrated the deep friendship between Chinese and Soviet literary and art workers.

Leningrad is a place I have visited before, and I have performed here before. This time, the antique hotel where the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association accommodated the Chinese delegation was the same hotel where I stayed seventeen years ago. Although Leningrad has undergone nine hundred days of arduous Patriotic War, many places of interest and cultural relics have been properly preserved. It is said that it was basically repaired in 1948, and hundreds of mansions were also built. We took a bus to visit the city and saw that new residential buildings were being built on Stalin Avenue.

At the "Actors' Home" in Leningrad, we participated in a joint party. When I was putting on makeup, a Soviet comrade told me that during the Patriotic War, each person only received one hundred centimeters of grain, but there were still two troupes that stayed in Leningrad to serve the soldiers and the people. This patriotic enthusiasm and selfless spirit are worthy of our learning.

This trip to Vienna, although short, gave me a great education. After participating in the Peace Congress, I deeply felt that peace will surely triumph over war. The conspiracy of the warmongers will definitely fail. The people of the world are uniting more broadly to fight for peace. During my stay in the Soviet Union, every Soviet comrade I came into contact with expressed their love for new China. After returning to China, the comrades from the Soviet cultural and art circles who visited our country during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" last winter widely promoted the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. I read Ulanova's "Thirty Days in New China," and I heard that she was also preparing to create a ballet based on new China. The famous director Komisarjevsky is working on staging "Qu Yuan," and "Romance of the West Chamber" has been staged simultaneously in twenty-seven cities. These all illustrate how much the Soviet people love new China. I deeply realize the important significance of the Soviet Union's great socialist and communist construction, and I firmly believe that after our country implements several five-year plans, we can also reach this satisfactory state.

### 从维也纳世界人民和平大会归来

    从维也纳世界人民和平大会归来
    梅兰芳
    参加了这一次在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，我更体会到世界人民保卫和平的坚强决心和伟大力量。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，已经过去了七个年头，但奥地利人民仍然生活在贫困不安中。曾经以音乐、戏剧著称于世的维也纳，如今是衰落到黯澹无光了。兀立在街头的蒙尘的贝多芬的塑像，面对着颓垣碎壁，也好像有无限的愤慨之情。那有名的歌剧院，四面支撑着木架子，虽在三四年前已经动工修理，但一直不能完成，这说明了这个文化艺术之城正遭受着怎样的命运。
    追随着美、英、法帝国主义集团的奥地利反动政府忠实地给它的主子执行冷战政策、加速备战、压榨人民。维也纳人民一直在失业和经济萧条的威胁下过生活。很多有名的音乐家，为饥寒所迫，已经改行或跑到了别的国家去。我曾经到一家乐器店，想替我儿子买一个小提琴的弓，价钱很贵。据店员告诉我，制作这种特种手工艺品的工人本来不多，战后因营业凋敝，产量更少，价钱就贵了起来，一张上等的“弓”，钱价几乎和过去一只提琴的售价相等。这虽是一件小事，但就此也可以了解维也纳的文化艺术，衰落到怎样可怕的程度。维也纳大街上一般商店的橱窗内虽然也陈设得很华丽，但是顾客寥寥，一片凋敝的气象。后来我们在莫斯科百货公司买东西，出口和进口的地方，人如潮涌，里面更加拥挤。货物也很丰富，自由选购，毫无限制。两相对比，愈加显出社会主义国家人民生活的优裕，和资本主义旧世界的没落。
    这一次大会比前两次保卫世界和平大会的代表性更为广泛，人数更多。仅文化艺术工作者的代表就有三百人，约占大会代表总名额五分之一。会议进行期间，代表中有一位从事艺术工作的德国女同志找我谈话，要我谈谈关于解放后新中国戏剧新的成就和艺人的生活情况，我都一一告诉了她。最后她又问我参加和平大会的体会如何，我说：“作为一个新中国的文艺工作者，我是热烈爱好和平的。参加这次大会，使我更加感到责任的重大。我今后将更加努力运用戏曲艺术武器，加强对和平事业的宣传”。
    大会胜利闭幕的时候，全体代表用各种语言高呼
    “和平万岁”，唱歌并互相拥抱。手巾和纸花满场飘舞。拍电影的水银灯照耀得如同白昼。一位白发老太太站到椅子上，拍着手，踏着脚，兴奋得流着眼泪说：“我永远忘记不了这次世界人民和平大会”。她的丈夫和女儿，都已经在二次大战中牺牲了。
    大会闭幕之后，我们中国代表受到苏联对外文化协会的热烈招待，在莫斯科、列宁格勒参观游览了十二天。我参加了苏联艺术界举行的三次联欢晚会。一九三五年，我和我的剧团曾到苏联演出，十七年后旧地重游，格外使我感到愉快。那时候，苏联还是一个刚刚成长起来的社会主义国家，而今天，它已经开始走向共产主义。我们参观了莫斯科的规模宏大的滚珠轴承工厂和附设的托儿所、医院、文化之家，这个厂的产品不但供全苏联，还能供应兄弟国家的需要。我们又参观了全世界最大的学府——莫斯科大学，校舍共有四万间房间。有人这么计算，如果一个孩子生下地后，每间住一天，要到一百零六岁，才能住遍。我上次到苏联的时候，地道电车正开始修建，有很多苏联男女青年参加劳动，我们剧团一部分人员还曾被邀参观试车。这次我们又去参观，地道电车的规模更大了，新建了许多车站，金碧辉煌，庄严整洁。壁上描绘着为苏联人民所敬仰的英雄人物，装饰着全苏联各民族的雕刻。有几个车站的设计者和建造者，曾得到了斯大林奖金。车子在地下行动，用电气操纵，车内空气流通，灯光明亮，每天运送的乘客有二百万人，有些乘客在车内阅读书报，有的女同志在车内编绒线衣服。
    在文化气息浓厚的高尔基大街上，有很多书店有乐器铺。当年我曾在此地散步，看到的是些古老矮小的房屋，现在却都为高楼大厦所代替了。我想在十七年之中，如果没有艰苦的卫国战争的年代，那还不知道要有怎样惊人的变化呢。
    我们在苏联还观摩了芭莱舞、歌剧、舞蹈、音乐和大马戏。他们表演的节目有些是古典的，有些是新的，给人的印象都很深刻。我在恰可夫斯基音乐厅看了彼雅特尼茨基俄罗斯民间合唱团（四个国家歌舞合唱团之一）表演的一个轻歌剧“在乡村旁”，那是用二十几种民歌和民族形式的舞蹈组成的，可是整个气氛非常和谐。
    在大马戏的表演中，穿插了这样一个有趣的节目：一个小丑是卖画的，他当场打开一画卷、上面画着一只脖子很长的牛，另外一个小丑问他：“那有这样长脖子的牛呀？”他说得很幽默：“这条牛生长在美洲，吃草在欧洲。”他一说完，全场无不大笑，因为大家知道，美帝国主义是企图统治全世界，欧洲的英法等国政府都变成了它的仆从。这个表演是一种有力的讽刺。
    一九五二年十二月三十日，苏联艺术界的同志们欢迎我们到“演员之家”参加联欢晚会。我表演了“思凡”和“霸王别姬”的剑舞，常香玉同志表演了“红娘”和“花木兰”中的一段，苏联优秀杰出的人民演员表演了歌唱舞蹈的精采节目。著名音乐家巴尔索娃教授致开幕词，剧终之后许多位人民演员登台献花。契尔卡索夫同志讲了话。这个晚会充分表现了中苏两国文艺工作者的深厚友谊。
    列宁格勒是我旧游之地，我以前曾经在这里表演过。这次苏联对外文化协会招待中国代表团住宿的一家古色古香的旅馆，正是我十七年前住过的旅馆。列宁格勒虽则经过九百天艰苦的卫国战争，许多名胜、文物却被妥善地保存着。据说这里在一九四八年基本上就都修复了，并且还修建了几百所大厦。我们乘车游览市区，看见斯大林大街上正在建筑新的住宅大厦。
    在列宁格勒“演员之家”，我们参加了联欢晚会。在我扮戏的时候，有一位苏联同志告诉我说：当卫国战争的期间，每人只发一百公分的粮食，但是还有两个剧团，留在列宁格勒为战士和人民服务。这种爱国的热诚和忘我的精神，是值得我们学习的。
    这次维也纳之行，虽然日子很短，但给了我很大的教育，参加了和平大会以后，我深深感觉到和平是一定能战胜战争的。战争贩子的阴谋一定失败，全世界人民是更加广泛地团结起来，为争取和平而斗争。在苏联停留期间，我所接触到的每一位苏联同志，都亲切地表示对新中国的热爱。去冬
    “中苏友好月”期间访问我国的苏联文化艺术界的同志们回国后，广泛地宣传中苏两国伟大的友谊。我读到了乌兰诺娃所写的“在新中国三十天”，听说她还准备以新中国为题材编一个芭蕾舞剧。名导演柯米沙日卫斯基正在着手排演“屈原”，在二十七个城市同时上演过“西厢记”，这些都说明了苏联人民对新中国是如何热爱。我深刻地认识到苏联的伟大的社会主义、共产主义建设的重要意义，我坚信我国施行了几个五年计划以后，也能达到这种美满的境地。
