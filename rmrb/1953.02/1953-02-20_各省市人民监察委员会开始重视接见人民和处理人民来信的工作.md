After the State Council's "Instructions on Strengthening People's Supervisory Correspondents and People's Reporting Reception Rooms" and the State Council People's Supervisory Committee's "Notice on Learning from the Zhang Shunyou Incident and Inspecting the Reception of the People and Handling People's Accusations" were issued, 37 provincial and municipal People's Supervisory Committees (hereinafter referred to as Supervisory Committees) across the country organized studies, and, in light of their actual situations, conducted in-depth inspections in terms of ideology and specific work. They criticized the bureaucratic work style of not attaching importance to receiving the people and delaying, accumulating, being careless, and perfunctory in handling people's accusations. They studied methods to improve their work in the future. As a result, most provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have seen new improvements in their work. Those who had not yet established reception rooms immediately established them; those who did not have enough cadres were assigned cadres. As of the end of last year, 78 reception rooms had been established by provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees across the country. According to statistics from 24 reception rooms, there were 78 cadres. Most provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have stipulated and improved some systems, such as receiving and dispatching registration, handling by dedicated personnel, transferring and urging, inspection and summary, closing cases and responding, etc. The Liaodong Province also stipulated that leaders should receive the masses regularly, and the Supervisory Committees of Hebei and Hunan provinces stipulated that major and complex cases should be received and handled by leaders personally. Due to the improvement of work, the number of people's letters received and people received by Supervisory Committees in various places has generally increased in recent months. For example, in Harbin City, the average number of people's letters received per month in 1951 was four, and now the average number received per month is 28. The Supervisory Committees in various places have generally handled the matters reflected in the people's letters and accusations seriously and promptly. For example, the reception room of the LÃ¼da City Supervisory Committee received a total of 241 letters from the people and received people's visits in the three months of October, November, and December last year, and 205 cases have been handled promptly, and the remaining 36 cases are also being processed. After the Hubei Provincial Supervisory Committee improved the work of the reception room, the handling of people's letters has been faster and more timely than before, and the handling of general letters does not exceed three days. The materials reflected in the people's letters and visits, in addition to criticisms or suggestions on the work of the government and its staff, mostly expose the coercive command style and violations of laws and disciplines by county, district, and township cadres, as well as the bureaucracy of some leading organs. The Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities have seized some typical cases with serious circumstances, such as the case of Zheng Huairen in Liaoxi who reported village cadres for corruption and violation of the law and was retaliated against, the case of Yang Yuehui in Tianjin who reported counter-revolutionaries and was retaliated against, the case of Mei Fangting in Shanghai who suffered unjust imprisonment due to the attack by bureaucrats, the case of Guo Haiyun, a patient in Jiangbei, Chongqing, who was detained for no reason by bureaucrats, delayed treatment, and died of illness, and the case of Wu Ce Lao in Suiyuan who was framed. The handling of these cases was carried out with great fanfare, which aroused the attention of cadres to the handling of people's letters and accusations, and also encouraged the masses' enthusiasm to supervise government organs and government staff.

The Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities have also begun to sort out the backlog of people's letters. The East China Supervisory Committee convened a forum of responsible cadres from the Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities in East China to study the handling of mass accusations and the clearing of backlog cases, and formulated specific methods to clear them in batches and on schedule. The Nanjing Municipal Supervisory Committee also specially assigned dedicated cadres to organize a group to clear backlog cases, sorted all the people's letters according to departments, prioritized them, assigned dedicated cadres to go deep into various units for specific assistance, and cleared and resolved them case by case. This work started in early November last year and ended on December 24, and 457 of the 505 backlog cases were cleared. Rehe Province and Liaoxi Province have achieved initial results in clearing backlog cases in conjunction with rural party consolidation work. For example, in the first batch of nine districts in Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, a total of 43 backlog cases have been processed in conjunction with rural party consolidation, and the other cases can also be closed before the end of party consolidation. Other provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees are also carrying out or have already carried out this work.

In addition to attaching importance to people's letters and accusations, some provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have also supervised and inspected the handling of people's letters by various government departments. In early October last year, the Harbin Municipal Supervisory Committee conducted a general inspection of the handling of people's letters by the Municipal People's Government, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the District Governments of various districts, and various units of the public security system, and found that the phenomenon of accumulating people's letters in various units was very serious. From January to October 1952, the Civil Affairs Bureau and the nine district governments alone received 13,724 people's letters, and the number of accumulated letters reached 3,049. During the inspection, the bureaucratic work style of transferring layer by layer and shirking responsibility was criticized, and units and cadres with serious errors were dealt with. The departments were urged to clear the backlog of cases, establish and improve various systems, and vigorously promote the handling of people's letters and accusations by various units in the city. The Suiyuan Provincial Supervisory Committee also conducted the same inspection on the handling of people's letters and accusations by 19 units in the province and city. The Xi'an Municipal Supervisory Committee convened a meeting of relevant cadres from various units in the city on November 15 last year to report and study this work, and stipulated that the accumulated cases should be cleared by the end of 1952.

However, to this day, a few provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees still do not pay enough attention to the work of handling people's letters, and have long accumulated people's letters without serious processing. In some provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees, there are too few cadres in the reception rooms. For example, the reception rooms in Hebei, Songjiang, and Yunnan provinces have only one full-time cadre, which makes it difficult to undertake this important task, and cadres must be supplemented immediately. In particular, government organs and supervisory organs below the provincial and municipal levels and the cadres of these organs have not universally attached importance to the work of handling people's letters. Many prefectural and county-level government organs and supervisory organs have not established reception rooms, and there is still no dedicated person in charge of handling people's letters. For example, the Suide Prefectural Office in Shaanxi Province and its subordinate counties have not established reception rooms. The phenomenon of accumulating people's letters for a long time still exists seriously in various places. According to statistics from 23 counties and cities in Liaoxi Province, the current backlog of people's letters has reached 2,267. For example, the Civil Affairs Section of the Baoji Prefectural Office in Shaanxi Province received and forwarded a total of 28 letters from the masses from January 17 last year, and none of them were processed by the end of last year. Because the prefectural and county-level organs and cadres do not attach importance to people's letters, it also affects the handling of cases by the higher-level government and the higher-level Supervisory Committee. Because the people's opinions or accusations cannot be properly resolved in the prefecture, county, and district, they have to appeal to higher levels, which leads to an increase in the number of cases directly accepted and the number of people received by the higher-level government and the Supervisory Committee. However, the higher-level government and the Supervisory Committee cannot send people to directly handle each case. Most cases still need to be transferred down for resolution, and the exchange of official documents prolongs the time and delays the people's production. As for the incidents of attacking and retaliating against informants, they still occur from time to time among county and district cadres. Therefore, whether the prefectural and county cadres attach importance to the work of handling people's letters will be the key to whether this work can be done well. Therefore, the most important issue at present, in addition to continuing to improve the people's reporting reception rooms at the provincial and municipal levels, is to quickly and universally establish people's reporting reception rooms in prefectures and counties, equip them with cadres, establish and improve working systems, and seriously handle people's letters. At the same time, we should strengthen education for lower-level cadres through the handling of typical cases, and continue to conduct serious struggles against the phenomenon of neglecting people's letters and visits. Since the situation of accumulating people's letters in various places is very serious at present, governments and Supervisory Committees at all levels should combine the current central work, clear up the backlog of cases, concentrate some forces to investigate and deal with them separately, and solve them quickly. Through this clearing work, summarize experiences, educate cadres, and guide future work. Supervisory Committees at all levels should also, like the Harbin Municipal Supervisory Committee, supervise the handling of people's letters and the reception of the people by various units, conduct inspections regularly with emphasis, commend the good ones, criticize the bad ones, introduce experiences, and promote various organs to do a good job in handling people's letters and receiving the people.
