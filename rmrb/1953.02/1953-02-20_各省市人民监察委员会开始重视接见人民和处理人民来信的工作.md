After the State Council's "Instructions on Strengthening People's Supervisory Correspondents and People's Reporting Reception Rooms" and the State Council People's Supervisory Committee's "Notice on Learning from the Zhang Shunyou Incident and Inspecting the Reception of the People and Handling People's Accusations" were issued, 37 provincial and municipal People's Supervisory Committees (hereinafter referred to as Supervisory Committees) across the country organized studies, and, in light of their actual situations, conducted in-depth inspections in terms of ideology and specific work. They criticized the bureaucratic work style of not attaching importance to receiving the people and delaying, accumulating, being careless, and perfunctory in handling people's accusations. They studied methods to improve their work in the future. As a result, most provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have seen new improvements in their work. Those who had not yet established reception rooms immediately established them; those who did not have enough cadres were assigned cadres. As of the end of last year, 78 reception rooms had been established by provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees across the country. According to statistics from 24 reception rooms, there were 78 cadres. Most provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have stipulated and improved some systems, such as receiving and dispatching registration, handling by dedicated personnel, transferring and urging, inspection and summary, closing cases and responding, etc. The Liaodong Province also stipulated that leaders should receive the masses regularly, and the Supervisory Committees of Hebei and Hunan provinces stipulated that major and complex cases should be received and handled by leaders personally. Due to the improvement of work, the number of people's letters received and people received by Supervisory Committees in various places has generally increased in recent months. For example, in Harbin City, the average number of people's letters received per month in 1951 was four, and now the average number received per month is 28. The Supervisory Committees in various places have generally handled the matters reflected in the people's letters and accusations seriously and promptly. For example, the reception room of the Lüda City Supervisory Committee received a total of 241 letters from the people and received people's visits in the three months of October, November, and December last year, and 205 cases have been handled promptly, and the remaining 36 cases are also being processed. After the Hubei Provincial Supervisory Committee improved the work of the reception room, the handling of people's letters has been faster and more timely than before, and the handling of general letters does not exceed three days. The materials reflected in the people's letters and visits, in addition to criticisms or suggestions on the work of the government and its staff, mostly expose the coercive command style and violations of laws and disciplines by county, district, and township cadres, as well as the bureaucracy of some leading organs. The Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities have seized some typical cases with serious circumstances, such as the case of Zheng Huairen in Liaoxi who reported village cadres for corruption and violation of the law and was retaliated against, the case of Yang Yuehui in Tianjin who reported counter-revolutionaries and was retaliated against, the case of Mei Fangting in Shanghai who suffered unjust imprisonment due to the attack by bureaucrats, the case of Guo Haiyun, a patient in Jiangbei, Chongqing, who was detained for no reason by bureaucrats, delayed treatment, and died of illness, and the case of Wu Ce Lao in Suiyuan who was framed. The handling of these cases was carried out with great fanfare, which aroused the attention of cadres to the handling of people's letters and accusations, and also encouraged the masses' enthusiasm to supervise government organs and government staff.

The Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities have also begun to sort out the backlog of people's letters. The East China Supervisory Committee convened a forum of responsible cadres from the Supervisory Committees of various provinces and cities in East China to study the handling of mass accusations and the clearing of backlog cases, and formulated specific methods to clear them in batches and on schedule. The Nanjing Municipal Supervisory Committee also specially assigned dedicated cadres to organize a group to clear backlog cases, sorted all the people's letters according to departments, prioritized them, assigned dedicated cadres to go deep into various units for specific assistance, and cleared and resolved them case by case. This work started in early November last year and ended on December 24, and 457 of the 505 backlog cases were cleared. Rehe Province and Liaoxi Province have achieved initial results in clearing backlog cases in conjunction with rural party consolidation work. For example, in the first batch of nine districts in Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, a total of 43 backlog cases have been processed in conjunction with rural party consolidation, and the other cases can also be closed before the end of party consolidation. Other provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees are also carrying out or have already carried out this work.

In addition to attaching importance to people's letters and accusations, some provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees have also supervised and inspected the handling of people's letters by various government departments. In early October last year, the Harbin Municipal Supervisory Committee conducted a general inspection of the handling of people's letters by the Municipal People's Government, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the District Governments of various districts, and various units of the public security system, and found that the phenomenon of accumulating people's letters in various units was very serious. From January to October 1952, the Civil Affairs Bureau and the nine district governments alone received 13,724 people's letters, and the number of accumulated letters reached 3,049. During the inspection, the bureaucratic work style of transferring layer by layer and shirking responsibility was criticized, and units and cadres with serious errors were dealt with. The departments were urged to clear the backlog of cases, establish and improve various systems, and vigorously promote the handling of people's letters and accusations by various units in the city. The Suiyuan Provincial Supervisory Committee also conducted the same inspection on the handling of people's letters and accusations by 19 units in the province and city. The Xi'an Municipal Supervisory Committee convened a meeting of relevant cadres from various units in the city on November 15 last year to report and study this work, and stipulated that the accumulated cases should be cleared by the end of 1952.

However, to this day, a few provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees still do not pay enough attention to the work of handling people's letters, and have long accumulated people's letters without serious processing. In some provincial and municipal Supervisory Committees, there are too few cadres in the reception rooms. For example, the reception rooms in Hebei, Songjiang, and Yunnan provinces have only one full-time cadre, which makes it difficult to undertake this important task, and cadres must be supplemented immediately. In particular, government organs and supervisory organs below the provincial and municipal levels and the cadres of these organs have not universally attached importance to the work of handling people's letters. Many prefectural and county-level government organs and supervisory organs have not established reception rooms, and there is still no dedicated person in charge of handling people's letters. For example, the Suide Prefectural Office in Shaanxi Province and its subordinate counties have not established reception rooms. The phenomenon of accumulating people's letters for a long time still exists seriously in various places. According to statistics from 23 counties and cities in Liaoxi Province, the current backlog of people's letters has reached 2,267. For example, the Civil Affairs Section of the Baoji Prefectural Office in Shaanxi Province received and forwarded a total of 28 letters from the masses from January 17 last year, and none of them were processed by the end of last year. Because the prefectural and county-level organs and cadres do not attach importance to people's letters, it also affects the handling of cases by the higher-level government and the higher-level Supervisory Committee. Because the people's opinions or accusations cannot be properly resolved in the prefecture, county, and district, they have to appeal to higher levels, which leads to an increase in the number of cases directly accepted and the number of people received by the higher-level government and the Supervisory Committee. However, the higher-level government and the Supervisory Committee cannot send people to directly handle each case. Most cases still need to be transferred down for resolution, and the exchange of official documents prolongs the time and delays the people's production. As for the incidents of attacking and retaliating against informants, they still occur from time to time among county and district cadres. Therefore, whether the prefectural and county cadres attach importance to the work of handling people's letters will be the key to whether this work can be done well. Therefore, the most important issue at present, in addition to continuing to improve the people's reporting reception rooms at the provincial and municipal levels, is to quickly and universally establish people's reporting reception rooms in prefectures and counties, equip them with cadres, establish and improve working systems, and seriously handle people's letters. At the same time, we should strengthen education for lower-level cadres through the handling of typical cases, and continue to conduct serious struggles against the phenomenon of neglecting people's letters and visits. Since the situation of accumulating people's letters in various places is very serious at present, governments and Supervisory Committees at all levels should combine the current central work, clear up the backlog of cases, concentrate some forces to investigate and deal with them separately, and solve them quickly. Through this clearing work, summarize experiences, educate cadres, and guide future work. Supervisory Committees at all levels should also, like the Harbin Municipal Supervisory Committee, supervise the handling of people's letters and the reception of the people by various units, conduct inspections regularly with emphasis, commend the good ones, criticize the bad ones, introduce experiences, and promote various organs to do a good job in handling people's letters and receiving the people.

    各省市人民监察委员会开始重视接见人民和处理人民来信的工作
    政务院“关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示”和政务院人民监察委员会“关于接受张顺有事件的教训、检查接见人民和处理人民控告的通知”发出后，全国有三十七个省、市人民监察委员会（以下简称监委会）组织了学习，并分别结合实际情况在思想上和具体工作上进行了深刻的检查，批判了不重视接见人民工作和在处理人民控告的事件中拖延、积压、马虎、潦草等官僚主义的作风，研究了今后改进工作的办法，因而多数省市以上监委会工作上有了新的改进。以前未建立接待室的马上建立了接待室；干部不够的配备了干部。截至去年年底止，全国省、市以上监委会已建立了七十八个接待室，据二十四个接待室的统计，有干部七十八人。各省、市监委会大都规定和改进了一些制度，如收发登记，专人办理，转办催办，检查总结，结案答复等等。辽东省还规定了首长定期接见群众，河北、湖南等省监委会规定重大复杂案件由首长亲自接见处理。由于改进了工作，各地监委会近几月来收到的人民来信和接见人民的数目普遍增加了。如哈尔滨市一九五一年平均每月收到人民来信四件，现在每月平均收到二十八件。各地监委会对于收到的人民来信和人民控告的事项大都作到了认真和及时的处理。如旅大市监委会接待室在去年十、十一、十二的三个月中收到人民来信和接见人民来访共二百四十一件，已及时处理了二百零五件，其余三十六件也正在处理。湖北省监委会改善了接待室的工作后，处理人民来信已较前迅速及时，一般来信的处理都不超过三天。人民来信和来访所反映的材料，除了对政府工作和工作人员提出批评或建议外，以揭发县、区、乡干部的强迫命令作风和违法乱纪，以及某些领导机关的官僚主义的较多。各省、市监委会都抓紧了一些情节重大的典型事件，如辽西郑怀恩检举村干贪污违法遭到报复事件，天津杨月辉检举反革命分子遭到报复事件，上海梅芳庭遭受官僚主义者打击的冤狱事件，重庆江北病人郭海云遭官僚主义者无故扣押，遗误医治以致病死事件，绥远武策劳被陷害事件等，进行了大张旗鼓的处理，引起了干部对处理人民来信、人民控告的重视，同时也更加鼓励了群众监督政府机关及政府工作人员的积极性。
    各省、市监委会还开始清理过去积压的人民来信。华东监委会为此曾召集华东各省、市监委会负责干部开座谈会，研究处理群众控告和清理积案的工作，并订出具体办法，分别先后按期清理。南京市监委会还特别抽出专门干部组织了清理积案小组，将全部人民来信按照部门分别轻重缓急作了排队，分派专门干部深入各单位进行具体帮助，逐案清理解决。这一项工作从去年十一月上旬开始到十二月二十四日为止，已将所有积案五百零五件中的四百五十七件清理完毕。热河省、辽西省结合农村整党工作清理积案已初步获得成绩，如辽西省义县第一批整党的九个区共有积案四十三件，已结合着农村整党处理了二十八件，其他的也可在整党结束前争取结案。其他省、市监委会也正在进行或已经作了这一项工作。
    有的省、市监委会除了自己重视人民来信和人民控告之外，还对政府各部门的处理人民来信工作进行了监督检查。哈尔滨市监委会于去年十月初旬对于市人民政府、民政局、各区区政府和公安系统各单位的处理人民来信工作进行了一次普遍检查，发现了各单位积压人民来信的现象很严重，仅民政局和九个区政府从一九五二年一月到十月共收到人民来信一万三千七百二十四件，而积压的就达三千零四十九件。在检查中批判了层层照转、推出了事的官僚主义作风，对错误严重的单位和干部作了处理，督促各部门对积案进行了清理，建立和健全了各项制度，有力地推动了该市各单位处理人民来信和人民控告的工作。绥远省监委会对省、市十九个单位的处理人民来信和人民控告的工作，也作了同样的检查。西安市监委会曾于去年十一月十五日召集该市各单位的有关干部开会，汇报研究此项工作，规定一九五二年底各单位将积案清完。
    但是，至今仍有少数省、市监委会对处理人民来信工作不够重视，长期积压人民来信，不认真处理。还有些省、市监委会的接待室干部太少，如河北、松江、云南等省的接待室只有一个专职干部，势难担负起这一重大任务，必须立即补充干部。尤其是省、市以下的政府机关和监察机关以及这些机关的干部对处理人民来信工作还没有普遍地重视起来，有不少的专区和县级的政府机关和监察机关还没有建立接待室，仍然没有专人负责处理人民来信。例如陕西省的绥德专署和所属各县都没有建立接待室。各地长期积压人民来信的现象仍然严重存在，据辽西省二十三个县、市的统计，目前积压的人民来信达二千二百六十七件，又如陕西省宝鸡专署民政科从去年一月十七日起共收转群众来信二十八件，拖到去年年底一件也没有处理。由于专、县级机关和干部不重视人民来信，也影响到上级政府和上级监委会对于案件的处理。因为人民的意见或人民的控告在专、县、区得不到适当的解决，不得不层层上告，致使上级政府和监委会直接受理的案件和接待的群众增多，而上级政府和监委会不可能逐件派人直接处理，多数案件仍须转下去解决，公文往返拖长了时间，也耽误了群众的生产。至于打击、报复检举人的事件，在县、区干部中也时有发生。因此专、县干部对于处理人民来信工作的重视与否，将是能否作好这项工作的关键。因此目前最重要的问题，除继续健全省、市人民检举接待室外，应该迅速普遍建立专区和县的人民检举接待室，配备干部，建立和健全工作制度，认真处理人民来信。同时应该通过典型案件的处理，加强对下层干部的教育，继续向忽视人民来信、人民来访的现象进行严肃的斗争。由于目前各地积压人民来信的情况很严重，各级人民政府和各级监委会应该结合当前中心工作，清理一次积案，集中一些力量分头调查处理，迅速解决，并通过此次清理工作总结经验，教育干部，指导今后工作。各级监委会并应像哈尔滨市监委会一样，监督各单位处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，经常有重点地进行检查，表扬好的，批评坏的，介绍经验，促使各机关作好处理人民来信和接见人民的工作。
