Let's All Pick Up Our Pens This Year
Lǎo Shě

In the past three years, among the "old" writers, I can be considered one who hasn't dropped his pen. My duties are no less than others; including those in the government and mass organizations, I have twenty "titles." However, I figured out a way to keep my hand from leaving the pen. The method is simple: insist on writing every morning, and only attend meetings and handle office work in the afternoon.

In the summer, I can work for four hours each morning; in the winter, three hours. Three or four hours can produce about a thousand words, so I can get thirty thousand words in a month. For a play with about fifty thousand words, a rough draft can be completed in two months. If this play needs to be rewritten six or seven times, it will take about another five or six months to finalize it. In this way, a multi-act play script can be completed in about eight months. With eight months gone in a year, the remaining four months can still produce some other works. Being able to write a multi-act play and some short articles or a one-act play in a year is not really a small amount.

Half a day for writing and half a day for other things is a good approach.

If some people, due to the nature of their work, cannot spare half a day every day for writing, I think they can still take a step back and spare two or three half-days each week to write some short essays or small poems. In the past three years, "old" writers have written very few even short essays and small poems. The less they write, the less they dare to write, which is very dangerous!

Also: a small number of "old" writers still have a writing life, but most "old" writers have given up their pens, inevitably causing newspapers and magazines to look for those few who are still writing to rush tasks. As a result, those few are so busy that they are flustered and confused. If they don't rush the tasks, they feel uneasy; if they do, they may not be able to complete the tasks and disrupt their original writing plans. Sometimes, I can receive phone calls from three places in one morning, asking for three different short articles, and each one seems to be the most important and must be written, which I can't handle! On the phone, I apologize repeatedly, but the other party still doesn't let up, making my head swell and dizzy. If everyone still holds a pen, even if they don't write long pieces, they still write some short ones, it will be possible to have a proper division of labor, and it won't be necessary for a few people to take on all the tasks.

I hope that "old" writers will strive to have time for writing: preferably every day, or at least every other day.

What enthusiasm supports me in constantly holding a pen? It's simple: I am a writer, and I want to continue writing! If I don't touch a pen for a day, I feel uncomfortable! In the past three years, about a quarter of the things I have written have been waste products, thrown into the wastebasket. This setback does not stop me from writing again, writing again, writing again. We must have a tenacious spirit! Don't be afraid of failure, maybe we will succeed.

To the young writers who have already achieved success, my words are simple: strive to become professional writers as early as possible, and don't delay. Becoming a literary writer is a lifelong endeavor; live and learn. Delaying the good time of youth or middle age is a great loss.

There is also a category of writers who used to write Beijing opera or local opera scripts, or chapter-style or notebook-style novels. Their writing is good, and they can also master certain popular art forms and techniques. However, their thinking may be slightly backward. For these writers, I think we should adopt the approach of everyone being a teacher and everyone being a student. That is to say, they should mix with new literary writers and engage in creative work together—especially the creation of popular arts. Living a collective creative life like this will benefit everyone. This is better and more effective than simply organizing ideological study classes for "old" writers in the past. It is not easy to solve those specific problems in creation by relying solely on ideological study.

The above is a little advice to "old" writers, young writers, and "old" writers. I don't know if it's right or wrong. (I don't like the word "old" here, but I can't think of a better word for a while.)

Here is another issue:

An artist should also be a thinker. Reading is an important source of thought. As I said earlier, I have worked hard in writing; however, I don't have time to read. This is a very, very big shortcoming!

I must participate in the various studies arranged by the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles. As long as I am invited to the reports organized by various parties, I must go and listen. However, I have not taken the initiative to systematically read. I write in the first half of the day and work in the second half of the day, averaging ten hours of work a day. By the evening, I am exhausted and can no longer study hard. In the evening, I can only read some old poems, classical literary masterpieces, as a pastime. New political theories, economic theories, and literary theories are too difficult to read, and I can't handle them. However, how can I become a writer of the new era if I don't understand these new books! In my writing process, I am indeed not afraid of hardship and do not feel ashamed to ask others for advice; I am not discouraged even if a manuscript is revised ten or twenty times. However, if my own thinking is brilliant and I can grasp the policies, I can hit the mark with one stroke and revise less often, saving some time. I hope that the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles will organize writers like me who "write but don't read" to read some books well! This is an urgent and sincere request. The detailed methods will not be discussed here.

I lack new knowledge and new theories, but I still know something about old things. On the other hand, some young literary and art cadres are the opposite of me. Their new knowledge and new theories may be quite rich, but they don't know much or nothing about the literary and artistic heritage of China and the world. Therefore, the things I write have a strong old flavor and lack freshness; what they write is sometimes too "fresh," and even the language is like a foreign language. I think they should also be organized to study literary and artistic heritage.

Everyone studies, and everyone will make progress. I would like to see: from the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles to the local Federations of Literary and Art Circles, there is an atmosphere of learning and creation from now on, mobilizing all the old, young, new, and old writers, learning while writing, writing well, and writing a lot! In this atmosphere, the office work of literary and art cadres is learning and creation. I hope that in 1953, every writer will pick up a pen; it is best to sign a patriotic increase production agreement for literature and art!

### 咱们今年都要拿起笔来

    咱们今年都要拿起笔来
    老舍
    在过去的三年里，我在“老”作家中可以算没有扔掉了笔的一个。我的职务不比别人少；连政府的带群众团体的，我有二十个“头衔”。但是，我想出一个办法，使我手不离笔。办法很简单：坚持每天上午写作，下午才去开会、办公。
    在夏天，每个上午我能工作四个钟头；冬天，三个钟头。三四小时可写得一千字左右，一个月就能得三万字。以一个长约五万字的剧本来说，有两个月即可草成初稿。假若这个剧本需要改写六、七遍，大约再需五、六个月即可定稿。这样，大致八个月的工夫可完成一个多幕剧剧本。一年去了八个月，其余的四个月还可以产生一些别的作品。一年中能写成一个多幕剧，和一些短文或一个独幕剧，实在不算少。
    半天写作，半天搞别的，是个不错的办法。
    假若有的人因工作性质，不可能每天匀出半日工夫去写作，我想那还可以退一步，每星期匀出两三个半天来，写些短的散文或小诗。过去三年，“老”作家们连短文小诗都写得很少。越不写，越不敢写，这很危险！
    还有：一小部分“老”作家还有写作生活，多数“老”作家已放弃了笔墨，势必各报纸各刊物都找那几个还拿笔的人赶任务。于是，那几位就忙得心慌意乱，不赶任务吧，于心不安；赶吧，既不见得能完成任务，又破坏了原定的写作计划。有时候，一个早上我能接到三处的电话，要三篇不同的短文，而且每一篇似乎都是最重要的，非写不可的，我无法应付！在电话中，我连连道歉，对方仍是不依不饶，急得我头胀脑昏。假若大家都还拿笔，即使不写长的，也还写些短的，一定可以适当的分工，不必教几个人包办任务了。
    我希望“老”作家们要去争取：最好是每天，其次是每隔一两天，有些执笔的时间。
    什么热劲儿支持着我经常拿笔呢？很简单：我是写东西的，我要继续写东西！一天不摸笔，我心里难受！三年来，我写过的东西里约有四分之一是废品，扔在字纸篓里。这挫折并拦不住我再写，再写，再写。我们要有个顽强劲儿！不怕失败，也许会成功。
    对已有成就的青年作家们，我的话很简单：及早争取变成职业作家，别再因循。要成为一个文艺作家是一辈子的事；活到老，学到老。耽误了青年或壮年的好时光是很大的损失。
    还有一类作家，他们以前写过京戏或地方戏剧本，或章回体笔记体小说。他们的文字很好，也能掌握某些通俗文艺形式与技巧。可是，他们的思想也许稍稍落后。对这些作家，我以为，应当采取人人是师傅，人人也是徒弟的办法。这就是说，他们应当和新文艺作家搀合起来，在一块儿搞创作——特别是通俗文艺的创作。这样过集体创作生活，彼此就都会得到好处。这比以往的单独地给“旧”作家办思想学习班什么的要好一些，收效大一些。单凭思想学习不易解决创作上的那些具体问题。
    以上是我对“老”作家，青年作家，和“旧”作家的一点建议，不知对与不对。（我不喜欢这里的“旧”字，但一时想不起更好的字眼来。）
    以下另说一个问题：
    一个艺术家也应当是个思想家。读书是思想的重要泉源。前面说过了，我在写作方面作到了苦学苦练；可是，我没有工夫读书。这是个很大很大的缺点！
    全国文协及北京市文联布置的各种学习，我必参加。各方面组织的报告，只要约我，我必去听。但是，我没有主动地有系统地去读书。上半天写作，下半天办公，平均每日工作十个钟头，到了晚上我已精疲力尽，不能再用功。晚间，我只能读些旧诗词，古典文艺名著，作为消遣。新的政治理论，经济理论，以及文艺理论，念起来都太费力，我吃不消。可是，不念明白这些新书，怎能作个新时代的作家呢！在我的写作过程里，我的确不怕吃苦，不耻请教别人；一部稿子修改十遍二十遍我也不泄气。可是，假若我自己的思想高明，能掌握政策，我就可以一下笔就是地方，就可以少改两遍，省下一些时间来。我希望全国文协把我这样“写而不读”的作家组织起来，好好地读些书！这是个迫切的诚恳的要求，详细办法不在这儿多说。
    我缺乏新知识新理论，对于老东西却还知道一些。另一方面，有些青年文艺干部正和我相反，他们的新知识新理论也许相当丰富，可是对于中国的世界的文艺遗产不大知道或全无所知。因此，我写的东西是老味道很厚，而缺乏新鲜劲儿；他们所写的又有时候太“新鲜”了，连语言都像外国话。我想，也该把他们组织起来，学习文艺遗产。
    大家都学习，大家都会有进步。我愿意看到：上自全国文协，下至各地方的文联文协，都从现在起，有一种学习与创作的空气，把老的少的新的旧的作家全动员起来，一边学，一边写，写的好，写的多！在这种空气里，文艺干部们的办公就是学习与创作。我希望：在一九五三年里，每个作家都拿起笔来；顶好都订定文艺的爱国增产公约！
