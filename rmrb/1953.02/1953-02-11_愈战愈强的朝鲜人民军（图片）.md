The ever-strengthening Korean People's Army

"The Korean people's war for the independence and freedom of their motherland, with the warm support of progressive humanity around the world, has achieved great victories and laid the foundation for achieving final victory.

"During the Fatherland Liberation War, the People's Army has tripled in size. Due to the increase in artillery, mortars, machine guns, automatic rifles, and other weapons, by 1952, the firepower of each infantry division had increased to 160 percent of that in 1951."
— From General Kim Il-sung’s report at the meeting of senior officers of the Korean People's Army on December 24, 1952

I. From 1951 to 1952, the artillery of the Korean People's Army increased to 128 percent, and mortars increased to 140 percent. The increasingly powerful artillery fire is fiercely bombarding the American aggressors.

II. Tanks and self-propelled guns increased to 182 percent. Here, a tank unit of the People's Army is gathering, preparing to advance on the enemy.

III. Anti-aircraft guns increased to 218 percent. Many female soldiers have also mastered modern combat techniques. Here, Kim Chang-hwa (left), a female anti-aircraft machine gunner who shot down an enemy plane, and her comrades are fighting American air bandits on the position.

IV. A scene of the meeting between Byun Ik-doo (right) and Kang Seong-kwon (left), who were awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Wang Yaorong, representative of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea and combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    “朝鲜人民争取祖国独立和自由的战争，在全世界进步人类的热烈支持下，已经取得巨大胜利，打下了取得最后胜利的基础。
    “在祖国解放战争期间，人民军在数量上已经增加了三倍。由于增加了大炮、迫击炮、机关枪、自动枪和其他武器，到一九五二年，各个步兵师团的火力，已经增加到一九五一年的百分之一百六十。”
    ——一九五二年十二月二十四日金日成将军在朝鲜人民军高级军官会议上的报告
    一、从一九五一年到一九五二年，朝鲜人民军的大炮增加到百分之一二八，迫击炮增加到百分之一四○。日益强大的炮火正在猛烈地轰击美国侵略军。
    二、坦克和自动炮增加到百分之一八二。这里是人民军某坦克部队正在集结，准备向敌人进击。
