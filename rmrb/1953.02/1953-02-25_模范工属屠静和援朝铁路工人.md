    Model Workers' Family Member Tu Jing and Railway Workers Aiding Korea
    Zhao Rong
    In early May 1951, Mo Weimin, a bridge team leader from the Yuehan Railway, and 127 workers volunteered to work on the transportation front in Korea. Before Mo Weimin departed, his wife, Tu Jing, asked him for a roster of employees. She explained, "You are the team leader, and since you're leaving, I should take responsibility for looking after the families of the team's employees." Mo Weimin was very touched. However, due to the hurried departure, he forgot to leave the roster.
    When Tu Jing and the family members bid farewell to their loved ones, they were able to remain calm, telling them to go to Korea with peace of mind and not to worry about home. However, as soon as the train started moving, everyone couldn't help but cry. Tu Jing looked at the three children standing beside her, the baby in her arms only two months old. Although she knew that Lao Mo (Old Mo) was going to Korea to protect the children, she couldn't help but feel sad. But she quickly realized that she was the wife of the team leader and had to set a firm example. She tried her best to stabilize everyone's emotions, advising them to go home and rest, and suggesting that they hold a meeting the next day.
    That night, Tu Jing hardly slept. She thought that she had a responsibility to first organize the families, then contact the trade union, so as not to make those going to the front worry.
    The next day, the family members gathered in the open space in front of the dormitory. Tu Jing explained to them the reasons why they should organize. That day, they established the Aid-Korea Workers' Family Committee, with Tu Jing as the chairwoman.
    Tu Jing had no work experience, but patriotic enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility supported her. By September, they had made contact with the higher-level trade union, and she felt even more grounded. She served the family members wholeheartedly. Among the family members were forty-two pregnant women. She convened them every week for a heart-to-heart meeting, mobilizing them to go to the hospital for childbirth using the new method. She offered her own savings for temporary loans to families in need. Later, she mobilized everyone to organize a savings and mutual aid group, so that everyone could cultivate a sense of collectivism through mutual assistance. She thought the most important thing was to mobilize the family members to encourage the workers at the front, so she paid great attention to raising the family members' political awareness. She personally read newspapers to everyone, taught them to sing songs, or played games. On October 11th of the previous year, she received a letter from Mo Weimin, knowing that four aid-Korea employees had been injured in a bombing. She thought that if she suddenly announced this news, it might cause unrest among the family members. Therefore, she first gathered the family group leaders to a meeting, explained the reasons clearly, and then passed the news down. As a result, not only did the family members not experience ideological fluctuations, but the families of the injured workers also angrily expressed that they must encourage their husbands to recover from their injuries and return to the front.
    Tu Jing not only served the family members but also did many things to help the railway workers at the front. For example, the salaries of the aid-Korea workers were issued by their original units. When the workers needed pocket money at the front, they would send a list to Tu Jing every month, asking her to collect 30,000 or 50,000 from each family and send it to Korea. When the Volunteer Army returning delegation went to visit their family members last August, she collected 117 packages, 95 letters, and 11,100,000 yuan prepared by the family members to send to the front-line workers, and asked the returning delegation to take them to the front.
    Among the aid-Korea railway workers, twenty-six had no families in Wuchang (all were unmarried youths or their families were not in Wuchang), and they entrusted Tu Jing to take care of everything for them. She was entrusted with collecting the salaries of dozens of people. Every month, when salaries were issued twice, Tu Jing handled them according to their entrustment. For example, 30% of Wen Qixian's salary was sent to him in Korea, 30% was sent to his lover in Guangzhou, and 40% was deposited in the bank; 50,000 yuan of Tang Shaosui's salary was sent to Korea every month, half of the remainder was sent to his home in Changsha, and half was deposited in the bank. As of last December, Tu Jing had handled over 340 million yuan without making a single mistake. Each person had a passbook and an account statement. The "Income" column on the account statement listed wages, cash for Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes, year-end bonuses, etc., and the "Expenditure" column listed remittances to Korea, remittances to home, purchases of pens, books, woolen clothing, cigarettes, etc., without any discrepancies. Tu Jing tried her best to help the aid-Korea workers with whatever they requested. For example, Yu Xing wanted to buy a lightweight dome mosquito net and a book on writing guidance, Liu Chao asked her to help his lover learn to read, Tang Shaosui asked her to send a gift to his home in Changsha before his father's birthday, Wang Guangyun asked her to resolve his lover's ideological concerns... She completed the tasks with great patience and enthusiasm. Some workers' family members did not live in Wuchang and sometimes wrote letters asking her for help. For example, Tang Shaosui's family needed to buy an ox for plowing, and Chen Zhongming's family needed to repair their house, and they both wrote letters to her. After receiving the letters, she took the initiative to remit money to them. In this way, Tu Jing wrote more than 1,200 letters to the workers and handled countless matters, but she didn't even know a single one of them.
    Her patriotic behavior inspired the workers of the bridge team going to Korea. Every time they wrote from Korea, they expressed that they wanted to learn from her and repay the support of the people of the motherland with practical actions.
    On January 6th of this year, Mo Weimin returned to Wuchang from Korea on leave. Tu Jing had just been elected as a model workers' family member in Wuhan City. The couple was overjoyed to meet each other. Their dormitory was immediately filled with people, and everyone said they were truly a model couple.
    Mo Weimin and Tu Jing had always helped each other. In the past twenty months, they had exchanged over 120 letters, an average of one letter every five days. Not only did they themselves receive encouragement and comfort from the correspondence, but the workers at the front also loved to read Tu Jing's letters, and the family members in the rear also loved to read Mo Weimin's letters. Mo Weimin's letters moved and educated Tu Jing and provided her with vivid materials for propaganda to the family members. Mo Weimin also frequently gave Tu Jing opinions on the work of the family members and urged her: "You should not be arrogant or impatient, but rely on the strength of the masses. If you sing a solo act, you will not be able to succeed." He said in his letter of March 5th last year: "I hope you will serve the aid-Korea workers from beginning to end. I recently read a book and learned that Chairman Mao is the most capable of accepting other people's opinions and thinking of others. We must strive in the direction of Chairman Mao." Such letters repeatedly educated Tu Jing and consolidated her patriotic enthusiasm.
    On January 11th, after attending the model workers' family members' symposium held by the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Tu Jing said to Mo Weimin as soon as she got home: "Lao Mo, when you return to the front tomorrow, tell them that I am a model workers' family member and that they should entrust me with more things to do."

    模范工属屠静和援朝铁路工人
    赵鎔
    一九五一年五月初，粤汉铁路一个桥梁队队长莫慰民和一百二十七个工人，志愿到朝鲜的运输战线上工作去了。莫慰民动身前，他的妻子屠静向他要一份职工名册。她解释道：“你是队长，你们走了，我应该负一份责任照应队里的职工家属。”莫慰民很受感动。但因匆促出发，忘记留下名册。
    屠静和家属们送别亲人时，都能沉住气，吩咐他们安心去朝鲜，不要罣念家里。但等火车一开，大家就忍不住哭起来了。屠静看看身边站着的三个孩子，手里抱的孩子才两个月，虽然知道老莫是为了保卫孩子们才远赴朝鲜的，但心里也不免有些难过。可是她很快地想到自己是队长的妻子，必须坚定地做个榜样。她竭力安定了大家的情绪，劝大家回家休息，建议第二天大家开个会。
    这天夜里，屠静简直没睡好觉。她想，自己有责任先把家属组织起来，再和工会联系，不能让上前线的人耽心。
    第二天，家属们在宿舍前的空场子上聚拢来。屠静向她们讲应该组织起来的道理。这一天，她们就成立了援朝工人家属委员会，屠静当了主席。
    屠静没有工作经验，但爱国热情和责任感支持着她。到九月间，她们和上级工会取得了联系，她心里就更着实了。她热诚地为家属们服务。家属中有四十二个孕妇，她每星期召集她们开一次谈心会，动员她们进医院用新法接生。她把自己的存款，供困难的家属们临时借用。后来她动员大家组织储蓄互助组，让大家通过互助，养成集体观念。她想最重要的是发动家属鼓励前线的工人，所以她非常注意提高家属的政治觉悟。她亲自给大家读报，教大家唱唱歌，或者做点游戏。前年十月十一日，她接到莫慰民的信，知道有四名援朝职工被炸伤了。她想，如果突然宣布这个消息，可能引起家属们的不安情绪。于是她先召集家属小组长开会，讲清道理，再把消息传达下去。结果不但家属们没有引起思想波动，受伤工人家属也都愤怒地表示，一定要鼓励她们的丈夫医好伤后重上前线。
    屠静不但为家属们服务，而且帮助在前线的铁路工人做了许多事。比如援朝工人的薪金是在原单位发的，工人们在前线要零用钱，每月都是寄个名单给屠静，请她代向各家三万、五万地收齐，寄到朝鲜去。前年八月志愿军归国代表去慰问她们家属的时候，她把家属们准备送给前线工人的一百十七个包裹、九十五封信和一千一百万元收集起来，请归国代表带到了前线。
    援朝铁路工人中有二十六人在武昌没有家（都是未婚青年或家属不在武昌），他们的一切事情都委托屠静照料。几十个人的薪金都托她代领。每月两次发工资，屠静都按他们的委托，分别办理。像温启贤的工资，每月百分之三十是给他寄往朝鲜，百分之三十寄给他在广州的爱人，百分之四十存入银行；唐绍睢的工资是每月寄五万到朝鲜，其余一半寄往长沙他家里，一半存入银行。截至去年十二月，屠静经手三亿四千余万元，没有弄错一笔。每人一个存折和一个账目单，账目单上
    “收入”项下填着工资、中秋月饼折现、年终奖金等，“支出”项下填着寄朝鲜、寄家中、代买钢笔、书、绒衣、香烟等，分毫不差。援朝工人无论有什么要求，屠静都尽量帮他们办。像余醒要买一顶轻便的圆顶蚊帐和一本指导写作的书，刘超要求她帮他爱人学文化，唐绍睢要求她在他父亲生日以前给长沙家里寄一份礼物，汪光云要求她解决他爱人的思想顾虑……她都以极大的耐心和热情完成了任务。有些工人家属不住在武昌，有时也写信请她帮忙。像唐绍睢家里要买耕牛，陈仲明家里要修理房屋等都写信给她。她接到来信后就作主给他们汇款。就这样，屠静总共给工人们写过一千二百多封信，办了不知多少的事，但连他们一个人她也还不认识。
    她这种爱国主义行为，鼓舞着赴朝桥梁队的工人。他们每次从朝鲜来信，都表示要向她学习，以实际行动报答祖国人民的支援。
    今年一月六日，莫慰民休假从朝鲜回到武昌。屠静这时正当选了武汉市的工属模范，夫妻俩见面真是说不出的欢喜。他们宿舍里马上拥满了人，大家都说他们真是模范夫妻。
    莫慰民和屠静一直是互相帮助的。二十个月来，他们通了一百二十次以上的信，平均五天就有一封信。不但他们自己从通信中互相得到鼓舞和安慰，而且前方工人们也爱看屠静的去信，后方家属们也爱看莫慰民的来信。莫慰民的来信，使屠静受到感动和教育，并给她提供了向家属宣传的活生生的材料。莫慰民还经常向屠静提出对家属工作的意见，并嘱盼她：“应该不骄不躁，依靠群众的力量，光唱独脚戏，就会办不通。”去年三月五日信里说：“我希望你有始有终地为援朝工人服务。我最近看书，知道毛主席是最能接受别人意见并为别人着想的人。我们要照着毛主席的方向努力。”这样的信，一次又一次地教育了屠静，巩固了她的爱国主义热情。
    一月十一日，屠静在武汉市总工会开完工属模范座谈会，一回家就对莫慰民说：“老莫，你明儿回到前线，告诉他们我是工属模范，要他们托我做更多的事情吧。”
