The Yongding River Guanting Reservoir project, which is currently under construction, is progressing extremely slowly, resulting in great waste, and serious casualties among the civilian workers. At the current rate of progress, the project will not be able to serve its flood control purpose before the flood season in late June as originally planned.

The Yongding River Guanting Reservoir project is currently the largest water conservancy project under construction in North China. Once completed, it will have a water capacity of 2.09 billion cubic meters. Construction on this project began in the winter of 1951. The project is divided into three main parts: the water diversion channel, the dam, and the spillway. According to the original plan, the water diversion channel should have been completed by the end of 1952, and 600,000 cubic meters of earth filling for the dam and part of the spillway should have been completed by the end of February this year. This would have enabled flood control before the 1953 flood season. However, as of January 23 this year, only one section of the tunnel for the water diversion channel has been completed. The intake tower at the entrance has not yet been designed, and the stilling basin at the exit is far from completion. Excavation for the dam foundation only began on December 24 last year, and is still not completed. Only a little over 35,000 cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone materials for dam construction have been transported to the site, accounting for only one-nineteenth of the total materials needed for the dam.

Due to the delay in the project, a huge amount of state wealth has also been wasted. For example, the stilling basin project at the exit of the water diversion channel was not completed before the flood season last year. The basin was filled with silt during the flood season, and had to be re-excavated after the flood season. This item alone wasted 553 million yuan. Due to the delay in the water diversion channel project, the diversion was postponed, and the upstream temporary dam had to be heightened and thickened, increasing the amount of earthwork, resulting in a loss of more than 500 million yuan. In addition, the tunnel entrance section was not carefully explored before excavation, and the roof of the tunnel collapsed for fourteen meters after excavation, resulting in a loss of more than 242 million yuan. According to the inspection results, the losses and waste in last year's construction alone amounted to more than 1.7 billion yuan.

The Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau does not pay enough attention to the safety of the civilian workers during construction. According to statistics, a total of 89 casualties occurred last year, with 11 civilian workers killed and 124 injured. Some of these work-related injuries were caused by falling rocks or collapses in the tunnel, some were caused by collisions and derailments of dump trucks, some were caused by axes, hammers, or stones hitting or crushing workers, some were caused by falls from high places during construction, or by overturning of vehicles, gas poisoning, or detonator explosions. The vast majority of these work-related injuries are attributable to negligence. For example, the incident on May 6 last year in which a worker was killed and 15 injured by falling rocks on the right slope of the tunnel inlet occurred because workers had repeatedly been injured by falling rocks, and workers had repeatedly requested thorough slope repair, but the responsible foreman did not accept the workers' opinions, nor did he report to the leadership, and the leadership did not inspect the site for a long time.

What are the reasons for the slow progress of the Guanting Reservoir project and the serious work-related injuries?

First of all, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau has overlapping institutions, resulting in ineffective command. The Engineering Bureau is the construction organization of the site and should directly command the construction like a command post on the front lines. However, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau has a large and overlapping organizational structure, and leaders at all levels are busy making charts and statistics in their offices (of course, these are also necessary) and cannot go deep into the lower levels. Only foremen, civilian work squad leaders, and a few engineering and technical personnel regularly direct construction activities. Although the leaders of the Engineering Bureau live on the construction site, they seem to live in a city far away from the construction site. They sometimes go to the construction site, but because they do not go deep into the lower levels, they cannot see what problems exist and cannot solve any problems. Thus, the plans, charts, and scheduled project progress that they "work hard" to create in their offices cannot be practical.

The existence of non-unified leadership and mutually offsetting forces in the bureau is also an important reason for the above situation. For example, each construction unit has its own small steel rails, dump trucks, and other transportation tools. Sometimes the dump trucks in one unit are idle and useless, while the other unit feels that there are no dump trucks available. The second construction unit is building a cement wall and does not have a cement mixer, which affects the progress of the project, while the first construction unit's cement mixer is idle there. Some construction units urgently need a center punch for pile driving, but other construction units have hammers that are idle and do not lend them out. There are many similar examples, which are all the result of overlapping institutions and non-unified leadership.

Second, the leading cadres of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau have serious conservative ideas, have not made good use of the advanced Soviet experience, and at the same time, there is a phenomenon of blind construction, which is also an important reason for the project delay, waste, and work-related injuries. Take the water diversion channel project, one of the three major projects of the reservoir, as an example: according to advanced Soviet experience, precise drilling must be carried out before excavating the water diversion tunnel. Three holes should be drilled every 50 meters. The tunnel is 523 meters long, and more than 30 holes should have been drilled. However, the leading cadres of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau did not follow these advanced scientific regulations and only drilled two holes in total. The Central Geological Team also came to the construction site and made suggestions twice before and after excavation. Their suggestions were ignored. Before excavation, comrades from the Geological Team pointed out: "The rock in the tunnel entrance section is loose and broken, and there is a possibility of collapse. The center line of the tunnel should be modified." But this was not accepted by the leading cadres of the Engineering Bureau. After the tunnel was excavated, comrades from the Geological Team pointed out again: "The entrance section of the tunnel must be provided with permanent support or changed to open-cut to ensure safety." The leading cadres of the Engineering Bureau considered this opinion, but did not seriously follow this opinion, which later caused a 14-meter collapse accident at the tunnel entrance. Fortunately, this incident occurred during a shift change and did not cause any casualties. According to the advanced Soviet assembly line operation method, tunnel excavation and lining should have been carried out alternately, which could shorten the project time. However, the Engineering Bureau did not adopt this experience, but started lining only after excavation was completed. Also, because the tunnel section was not accurately grasped during excavation, it was found that the section was not large enough during lining, so the section had to be repaired again, which also wasted a lot of time and manpower.

Third, unreasonable organization and use of civilian labor, poor ideological education, and low work efficiency of civilian workers are also important reasons for the project delay. On a transport distance of 2.5 kilometers, each worker only transports an average of 0.8 cubic meters of earth. The workers participating in the excavation of the dam foundation excavate an average of 0.52 cubic meters per person per day, which is the highest record. According to An Qiyuan, director of the civilian work command, "If the potential of the civilian workers is fully utilized, there will be no problem in increasing work efficiency by another 25%." According to Liu Zhongrui, director of the Central Ministry of Water Resources Engineering Bureau, "If the civilian workers are mobilized and used well, efficiency can be doubled." It can be seen that labor efficiency can be greatly improved. Secondly, the attendance rate of civilian workers is low. Many civilian workers work for a few days and rest for a few days. The attendance rate sometimes drops to 50% or 60%, and the lowest even drops to 18%. The phenomenon of civilian workers returning home privately is also very serious. More than 3,000 people have been replenished continuously from last winter to now, but the number of civilian workers still only remains at the original number of 15,000, without increasing. Thirdly, the organization of labor is unreasonable. When excavating the dam, the labor force was not well organized, the roads were narrow, and people were crowded together, making it difficult to operate. There were few excavators and tools, and the speed of excavation often could not keep up with the speed of transportation, resulting in serious idleness. In addition, because the civilian workers were not well educated to improve their operating skills and cherish tools, dump trucks were thrown around, and the dump trucks went downhill too fast, which not only damaged many trucks, but also caused many work-related injuries. More than 400 dump trucks have been damaged, accounting for one-third of the total number of dump trucks, which greatly affects the transportation capacity and the progress of the project.

Although the above are only some preliminary investigations, it can be seen that there are many serious problems in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir project. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has paid attention to these problems and has sent people to investigate and assist in solving these problems. According to the responsible parties of the Ministry of Water Resources, they are determined and confident to solve these problems. However, there are only a few months left before the flood season, and if these problems cannot be resolved decisively and quickly, the consequences will be very serious.

    永定河官厅水库工程进展缓慢浪费很大
    目前正在兴修的永定河官厅水库工程，进展极为缓慢，浪费很大，民工伤亡事故严重。按照目前的工程进度，这个工程将不能按原计划在六月底伏汛前发挥拦洪作用。
    永定河官厅水库工程，是目前华北正在兴修的一个最大的水利工程，工程完成后，可容水二十点九亿立方公尺。这个工程是在一九五一年冬开始动工修建的。工程共分三个主要部分，即输水道工程、拦河坝工程、溢洪道工程。按照原定计划在一九五二年年底要完成输水道工程，今年二月底以前完成拦河坝填土六十万立方公尺工程，和溢洪道工程的一部分。这样即可在一九五三年伏汛以前起拦洪作用。但直到今年一月二十三日，输水道工程仅完成隧洞一段，入口处的进水塔还没有设计好，出口处的静水池距完成任务尚远；拦河坝坝基开挖工程，直到去年十二月二十四日才开始，现在也还没有完成。筑坝用的土沙石料也仅仅运到三万五千多立方公尺，只占全坝用料的十九分之一。
    由于工程延期，也浪费了国家的巨额财富。如输水道出口处的静水池工程，因去年伏汛前未能完成，汛期洪水到来，池内被泥沙淤满，汛期过后又重新开挖。仅这一项即浪费了五亿五千三百余万元。由于输水道工程拖延，导水延期，上游临时挡水坝必须加高培厚，增加土方，损失五亿多元。另外，隧洞进口部分在开凿前没有认真进行钻探，开凿后洞顶塌方十四公尺，也损失两亿四千二百余万元。根据检查结果，在去年一年施工当中，损失浪费即达十七亿元之多。
    官厅水库工程局在施工中对民工的安全是不重视的。据统计：去年一年共发生伤亡事故八十九件，民工死亡十一人，伤一百二十四人。这些工伤事故，有的是因隧洞坠石或塌方造成的，有的是因斗车互撞出轨翻车造成的，有的是斧、锤、石头碰伤或砸伤的，有的是在施工中由高处跌下造成的，或汽车翻倒、煤气中毒、雷管爆炸造成的。这些工伤事故绝大多数属于责任事故。如去年五月六日隧洞进水口右坡坠石，砸死工人一名，伤十五名的事件，即是在多次坠石砸伤工人，工人多次要求彻底修坡，但负责领工人员既不接受工人意见，也不向领导反映，领导方面又长期没有检查的情况下造成的。
    官厅水库工程进展迟缓和发生严重工伤事故的原因是什么呢？
    首先，是官厅水库工程局机构重叠，指挥不灵。本来工程局就是工地的施工组织，应该像前沿阵地的指挥所一样，直接指挥施工。但官厅水库工程局机构庞大，层次重叠，各级领导干部在房子里忙于制图表、作统计（当然这些也是需要的），不能深入下层；经常指挥施工活动的只是领工员、民工分队长和少数工程技术人员。工程局的领导干部虽然是住在工地，但也好像是住在远离工地的城市一样。他们有时也到工地走走，但因没有深入下去，也看不出什么问题，解决不了什么问题。这样，他们在房子里“辛辛苦苦”作出来的计划、图表和预定的工程进度，也就不能切合实际了。
    该局存在着领导不统一和相互抵消力量的现象，这也是造成上述情况的重要原因之一。例如，各施工所有自己的小钢轨、斗车等运输工具，有时这个所里的斗车空起来没用，那个所里却感到没有斗车可用。第二施工所打洋灰墙，没有洋灰拌合机，影响了工程的进行，第一施工所的洋灰拌合机却在那里闲着；有的施工所打桩急需用穿心锤，但另外的施工所有锤闲着也不借给。类似的例子还有很多，这都是机构重叠、领导不统一所造成的结果。
    第二、官厅水库工程局领导干部存在严重的保守思想，没有很好地采用苏联的先进经验，同时存在盲目施工的现象，这也是工程延期、造成浪费、发生工伤事故的重要原因。以水库三项主要工程之一的输水道工程为例：依照苏联先进经验，在开凿输水洞前必须进行精确的钻探，每五十公尺应钻三个眼，隧洞共长五二三公尺，本应钻三十多个眼。但官厅水库工程局的领导干部不按照这些先进的科学规定办事，总共只钻了两个眼。中央地质队也来过工地，曾于开凿前开凿后两次提出建议，他们的建议都被忽视了。地质队的同志在开凿前指出：“隧洞进口段岩石松碎，有塌方可能，应当修改隧洞的中心线。”但未被工程局领导干部接受。洞子开凿后，地质队的同志又指出：“洞口一段必须加永久支撑或改为明开，才能保证安全。”工程局领导干部虽考虑过这个意见，但并未认真按照这个意见作，以致后来造成洞口十四公尺塌方事故。此次事件幸而发生在换班时间，未造成伤亡。依照苏联先进的流水作业法经验，原应使隧洞开凿和衬砌穿插进行，这样可以缩短工程时间。但工程局也不采用这个经验，而是在开凿完成后才开始衬砌；又由于开凿时未精确掌握隧洞断面，到衬砌时发现断面不够大，只得重新修理断面，这样也浪费了很多时间和人力。
    第三、民工的组织和劳力使用不合理，思想教育工作差，民工工作效率低，也是造成工程延期的一个重要原因。在二点五公里的运距上，每个工平均仅运零点八方土；参加开挖坝基的工人，每天每人平均开挖零点五二方，即成为最高纪录。据民工指挥部主任安起元说：“如果民工潜在力充分发挥出来，再增加百分之二十五的工作效率不成问题。”又据中央水利部工务司司长刘锺瑞说：“如民工发动和使用的好，效率可以提高一倍。”由此可见劳动效率是可以大大提高的。其次是民工出勤率低，许多民工多是作几天，歇几天。出勤率有时竟下降到百分之五六十，最低的甚至降低到百分之十八。民工私自回家的现象也很严重。从去年冬天到现在已连续补充了三千多人，但民工人数仍只保持原来一万五千人的数字，没有增加。再次是劳动力组织不合理。开挖大坝的时候，劳动力没有组织好，便道狭窄，人群拥挤在一起，运转不灵，挖土的人和工具又少，出土的速度常供不上运土的速度，因此发生了严重的窝工现象。此外，由于没有很好教育民工提高操作技术、爱护工具，斗车乱摔乱丢，斗车下坡太快，不仅损坏了不少车子，也发生了很多工伤事故。目前已损坏了四百多辆斗车，占全部斗车数次三分之一，大大影响了运输力和工程的进度。
    上面虽然只是一些初步调查，但已能看出目前官厅水库工程在施工中存在着许多严重问题。目前中央人民政府水利部已经重视了这些问题，并已派人前往调查和协助解决这些问题。据水利部负责方面谈：他们有决心和信心解决这些问题。但是目前离伏汛期只有几个月了，这些问题如果不能得到果断的迅速的解决，其后果将是很严重的。
