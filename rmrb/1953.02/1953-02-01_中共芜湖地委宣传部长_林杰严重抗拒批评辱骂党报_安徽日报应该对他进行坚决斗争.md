The Anhui Daily published a news item on January 23rd entitled "Lin Jie, Member of the CCP Wuhu Prefectural Committee and Propaganda Minister, Suppresses Criticism, Insults the Party Newspaper, and Has a Heinous Work Style."

On July 15, 1950, the Wanbei Daily published a letter from Sun Yan, Lin Jie's ex-wife, exposing Lin Jie's errors of beating his wife and playing with women. Lin Jie and Sun Yan had originally freely married after joining the revolution. Later, because Sun Yan could not have children, Lin Jie wantonly insulted her, saying she was "not as good as a chicken, as a chicken can at least lay eggs." At the time, the Marriage Law had only recently been promulgated, and Lin Jie actually misinterpreted the Marriage Law in order to achieve the improper goal of divorce. In order to correctly implement the Marriage Law and educate the broad masses of cadres and the people, the Wanbei Daily exposed and criticized Lin Jie's feudal, backward thinking and his behavior of playing with women. How did Lin Jie, then Deputy Secretary of the CCP Lu'an County Committee, treat this correct criticism from the Party newspaper? Instead of conducting a deep self-criticism, openly admitting his mistakes, and correcting them with practical actions, he refused to accept the criticism and never made any self-criticism. Not only that, but he even became angry and hateful, insulting the Party newspaper. Lin Jie once said to cadres: "The Wanbei Daily is a Kuomintang newspaper, I don't read it and I don't write for it," and more than once told Yang Jie, the former Propaganda Minister of the CCP Chaohu Prefectural Committee: "Don't submit your articles to the Wanbei Daily, the Wanbei Daily is a Kuomintang newspaper."

In 1952, when Lin Jie was the Secretary of the CCP Wuwei County Committee, a cook named Wang in the county committee organ made some comments about him during the "Three-Anti" campaign. Afterwards, he retaliated against the cook, sarcastically saying: "You are so active, how come you are still a cook?" Once, when he was in Wuwei, he went to the prefectural committee for a meeting. The boat was very crowded, and the head of the processing section of the prefectural special grain bureau accidentally bumped into him when getting on the boat. He became furious and ordered the guards to watch over the head of the processing section. After arriving in Chaoxian County, he even wanted to imprison him.

We must ask: Which is the "Kuomintang newspaper," the Wanbei Daily, which implemented the CCP Central Committee's decision to conduct criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper, or Lin Jie himself, who resists criticism, insults the Party newspaper, suppresses democracy, and arbitrarily infringes on human rights, and thus has a "Kuomintang work style"? When Lin Jie insulted his wife as being "not as good as a chicken," when Lin Jie cursed the Wanbei people's newspaper as a "Kuomintang newspaper," when Lin Jie ordered guards to arbitrarily detain a revolutionary cadre who had done nothing wrong, anyone with a little political common sense would understand what kind of person Lin Jie really is.

What is strange is that Lin Jie, whose character and work style are so bad, has been repeatedly promoted, from Deputy Secretary of the CCP Lu'an County Committee to Secretary of the CCP Wuwei County Committee, and then to Member of the Wuhu Prefectural Committee and Propaganda Minister. People cannot help but ask: Why has the local Party organization tolerated him to such an extent?

Equally strange is that the former Wanbei Daily and the current Anhui Daily have not tightly grasped the weapon of public criticism to wage a relentless struggle against Lin Jie, who so seriously resists criticism and violates laws and disciplines. Instead, they compromised and retreated whenever they encountered setbacks, so that the matter was dragged on until today to be "brought into the sunlight." But what should be done in the future? This remains to be seen whether the Anhui Daily has the courage to persevere in the struggle.

### 中共芜湖地委宣传部长  林杰严重抗拒批评辱骂党报  安徽日报应该对他进行坚决斗争

    中共芜湖地委宣传部长
    林杰严重抗拒批评辱骂党报
    安徽日报应该对他进行坚决斗争
    安徽日报在一月二十三日发表了“中共芜湖地委委员兼宣传部长林杰压制批评，辱骂党报，作风恶劣”的消息。
    一九五○年七月十五日皖北日报刊载了林杰的前妻孙彦的来信，揭发林杰打骂妻子、玩弄女性的错误。林杰和孙彦本来是参加革命后自由结合的，以后林杰因孙彦不生育，就对她肆意辱骂，说她“不如一只鸡，鸡还会生蛋”。当时正当婚姻法颁布不久，林杰竟曲解婚姻法，以达到不正当的离婚目的。皖北日报为正确贯彻婚姻法，并教育广大干部群众，就在报上对林杰的这种封建落后和玩弄女性的思想行为进行了揭发和批判。当时身为中共六安县委副书记的林杰，怎样对待党报这一正确的批评呢？他不是深刻检讨，公开承认错误，并以实际行动来纠正错误；而是拒绝批评，始终不作检讨。不但这样，他甚至恼羞成怒，仇视和辱骂党报。林杰曾经在干部中说：“皖北日报是国民党报纸，我不看它也不写稿”，并不止一次地对前中共巢湖地委宣传部长杨杰说：“你写稿子不要投到皖北日报去，皖北日报是国民党报纸。”
    一九五二年林杰担任中共无为县委书记时，县委机关一个姓王的炊事员，在“三反”中对他提了些意见，他在事后即对这个炊事员进行打击，讽刺他：“你这么积极，怎么干到现在还当伙夫？”他在无为时，又有一次，去地委开会，船上很挤，专署粮食局加工科科长在上船时碰了他一下，他就大发脾气，叫警卫员将这个加工科科长看管起来，到巢县后还要将他关押。
    我们要问：究竟是执行中共中央的决定，在报上展开批评与自我批评的皖北日报是“国民党报纸”，还是抗拒批评、辱骂党报、压制民主并任意侵犯人权的林杰自己是“国民党作风”呢？当林杰侮辱自己的妻子“不如一只鸡”时，当林杰破口大骂皖北人民的报纸是“国民党报纸”时，当林杰叫警卫员随便看押一个毫无错误的革命干部时，凡有点政治常识的人，一看就会明白林杰究竟是什么人了。
    奇怪的是：像品质和作风如此恶劣的林杰，居然能够一再被提拔，从中共六安县委副书记而无为县委书记，而芜湖地委委员兼宣传部长。人们不禁要问：当地党的组织为何一直纵容他到这样的地步？
    同样奇怪的是：前皖北日报和现在的安徽日报，对于林杰这样严重抗拒批评和违法乱纪的人，不是紧紧掌握公开批评的武器，对他进行无情的斗争，而是一遇到挫折就妥协、退让，以致事情拖到今天才“拉到日光下来”。但今后应该怎样办？这还须看安徽日报有无坚持斗争的勇气。
