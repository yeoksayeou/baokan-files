Xinhua News Agency Report: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a circular on the 4th to relevant agencies in various localities regarding the inspection and handling of cases of falsely reporting bumper harvest achievements. The circular first pointed out: Rewarding patriotic model laborers in bumper harvests is an important task in agricultural production. The People's Government has always taken this work very seriously, and the yields of the award-winning units and the political qualifications of the award recipients are generally investigated and examined. Therefore, most of the patriotic model laborers in bumper harvests and model workers who have received awards in the past are figures supported by the masses and have a high reputation among the masses. For this reason, the People's Government's policy of rewarding bumper harvests has taken root in the hearts of the people and become a powerful weapon for promoting production. However, in some places, due to the strong utilitarian thinking of the staff, and the tendency to boast and seek quick success, they do not conduct in-depth investigations and research in their work, but instead, with a bureaucratic attitude, make random reports based on hearsay. Therefore, there have been some cases of making false reports, exaggerating production achievements, and even wrongly awarding fake models.

The circular then listed a series of examples of falsely reported yields: In Henan Province's Xiangcheng County, when applying to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for awards for wheat bumper harvest units, the measurement of crop land was not carried out at all in accordance with the prescribed reward methods. The bumper harvest land of Zhu Xianzong in the county was originally reported as 1.5 mu, but the actual measurement result should be 1.807 mu, so the yield per mu was incorrect; and of the eleven bumper harvest units applying for awards in the county, seven units did not meet the award criteria after the area was corrected. Due to the fact that the cadres responsible for predicting yields were dominated by utilitarian thinking, the predicted wheat yields of the Ma Qingfu and Li Kun agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province were 4,590 jin and 5,500 jin per hectare, respectively; in reality, the actual yield of the Ma Qingfu agricultural production cooperative was only 2,250 jin per hectare, and the yield of the Li Kun agricultural production cooperative was only more than 1,700 jin per hectare. The predicted yields of these two agricultural production cooperatives exceeded the actual yields by one to two times. Without actual verification, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture reported these predicted figures to the Northeast Agricultural Department and published them in the Northeast Daily, which had a very bad impact on the masses. Shanxi Province's Quwo County once reported to the Commissioner's Office that there were seven cotton thousand-jin bumper harvest households in Dainan Village alone; in addition, there were also three cotton bumper harvest households with more than one thousand jin in Da Li Village. However, after inspection by the provincial and Commissioner's Office inspection teams, the results were: the best bumper harvest household in Dainan Village, Chang Changqing's cotton field, could only produce 503.4 jin; the second best was Zhang Furong's cotton field, which could only produce 439 jin; the remaining households only produced 300 to 400 jin. The highest yield per mu of the three cotton bumper harvest households in Da Li Village could only reach 533 jin. The process of the false report was: Zhang Furong, the secretary of the Dainan Village branch of the Communist Party of China, participated in the cotton thousand-jin competition, and when he saw that he could not complete the plan during the autumn harvest, he falsely reported a thousand jin. This caused dissatisfaction among others. Several farmers angrily said: If Zhang Furong's cotton can reach a thousand jin, we can also produce a thousand jin. After hearing this news, several farmers in Da Li Village were also unconvinced and said they could also reach a thousand jin. In this way, the news of the cotton thousand-jin bumper harvest spread. Qu cadre Zhang Tiquan came to Zhang Furong's field, took a cursory look, and reported the good news to the county, and the county reported it to the Commissioner's Office. The masses' angry reporting of a thousand jin was a protest against Zhang Furong's false report, but the leading cadres blindly regarded these as "bumper harvest achievements." In addition, more seriously, some leading cadres in some places have impure thoughts and deliberately fabricate false reports to steal honor. For example, the leading organs of Lushan County, Henan Province, fabricated the bumper harvest achievement of 676 jin per mu of three mu of wheat in the Wen Xianglan agricultural production cooperative in the county, in an attempt to steal the credit for leading production. The Henan Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture lightly believed this false report and wrongly awarded the Wen Xianglan agricultural production cooperative. The incident of Sun Tieyun, the director of the Guichi County Farm in Anhui Province, defrauding the title of "Model Bumper Harvest Farm" was even worse. Based on the false statistics made by Xu Naiqing and other technical cadres of the farm, that the farm had 24.6 mu of land, with an average of more than 1,200 jin per mu, of which 1.06 mu of land produced 1,660 jin per mu, Sun Tieyun made a report at the county labor model conference, and was therefore rated as a "Model Bumper Harvest Farm." When the Anqing Special Zone inspection team went to inspect, Sun Tieyun refused to admit his mistake and tried every means to deceive the inspection.

The circular emphasized: This kind of behavior of falsely reporting bumper harvest achievements and defrauding rewards has had a very bad impact on the masses. If we use such reports to understand the situation of agricultural production, formulate plans, determine policies, and guide work, the consequences are unimaginable. In order to strictly implement the reward policy and correct the thinking of cadres and the masses, the circular instructed: (1) Agricultural departments at all levels should conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the implementation of the bumper harvest reward policy. (2) Any intentionally or unintentionally created false report of bumper harvest achievements is a serious error. The relevant personnel who have committed such errors must make a serious self-criticism and publicly publish it in the newspapers; those with serious circumstances must be given appropriate punishment.

### 中央人民政府农业部发出通报  各地应严肃检查处理假报丰产成绩事件

    中央人民政府农业部发出通报
    各地应严肃检查处理假报丰产成绩事件
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府农业部在四日向各地有关机关发出了关于有些地方假报丰产成绩应予检查处理的通报。通报首先指出：奖励爱国丰产模范是农业生产上一项重要工作。人民政府对待这项工作一向是很严肃的，受奖单位的产量和受奖者的政治条件一般都经过调查和考察。因此，过去获得奖励的爱国丰产模范和模范工作者大都是群众所拥护的人物，在群众中有很高的威信。也因此，人民政府奖励丰产的政策，才深入了人心，成为推动生产的有力武器。但是，有些地方由于工作人员存在着浓厚的功利主义思想，好大喜功，他们在工作中不是深入调查研究，而是以官僚主义的态度，根据道听途说，随便乱报。因此，曾经发生了一些做假报告，夸大生产成绩甚至错奖假模范的问题。
    通报接着列举了一系列虚报产量的例子：河南省项城县在向中央人民政府农业部申请奖励小麦丰产单位的工作中，根本没有按照规定的奖励办法测量作物地亩。该县朱显忠的丰产地原报为一亩五分，实测结果应当是一点八○七亩，这样每亩产量就不对了；而全县申请奖励的十一个丰产单位，在改正面积后，就有七个单位不能达到奖励标准。由于负责预测产量的工作干部受着功利主义思想的支配，黑龙江省马庆福和李坤两个农业生产合作社的小麦预测产量分别为每垧四千五百九十斤和五千五百斤；实收下来，马庆福农业生产合作社的每垧产量只有二千二百五十斤，李坤农业生产合作社的每垧产量只有一千七百多斤，这两个农业生产合作社预测的产量竟分别超过实收产量一倍以至两倍以上。黑龙江省人民政府农业厅未经实收证实，就把这种预测数字报告到东北农业部，并且在东北日报上发表，这就在群众中造成了很坏的影响。山西省曲沃县曾向专署汇报：只大南庄一村就有棉花千斤丰产户七个；另外，大李村也有三个千斤以上的棉花丰产户。后经省和专署检查团检查的结果却是：大南庄最好的丰产户畅长清的棉田，只能产到五百零三斤四两；其次是张福荣的棉田，也只能产四百三十九斤；其余各户都只产三、四百斤。大李村的三个棉花丰产户最高的每亩只能产到五百三十三斤。假报告的过程是：中共大南庄支部书记张福荣参加了棉花千斤竞赛，秋收时看到完不成计划即假报千斤。引起别人不服气。有几户农民赌气说：张福荣的棉花能达到千斤，我们也能产千斤。大李庄的几户农民听到这个消息以后，也不服气，也说能达到千斤。这样棉花千斤丰产的消息就传出去了。区干部张体全来到张福荣的地里，走马观花地看了看，就向县里报喜，县里又报到专署。群众赌气报千斤是对张福荣假报告的一种抗议行为，而领导干部却盲目地把这些都当作“丰产成绩”。此外，更严重的是，有些地方的领导干部思想不纯，竟有意捏造假报告来窃取荣誉的。如：河南省鲁山县领导机关捏造了该县文香兰农业生产合作社三亩小麦每亩产六百七十六斤的丰产成绩，企图以此窃取领导生产的功绩。河南省人民政府农林厅轻信了这个假报告，就错奖了文香兰农业生产合作社。安徽省贵池县农场场长孙铁云骗取“丰产模范农场”的事件，更是恶劣。孙铁云根据该场技术干部徐乃清等所作的全场有田二十四亩六分，每亩平均一千二百多斤，其中有一亩零六厘田合每亩产一千六百六十斤的假统计，在该县劳模大会上作了报告，因此被评为“丰产模范农场”。当安庆专区检查组前往检查时，孙铁云还不承认自己的错误，反而百般蒙混检查。
    通报强调指出：这种假报丰产成绩，骗取奖励的行为，在群众中所造成的影响十分恶劣。如果根据这种报告来了解农业生产的情况，制订计划，决定政策，指导工作，其结果是不堪设想的。为严肃执行奖励政策，端正干部群众思想，通报指示：（一）各级农业部门应对执行丰产奖励政策的情况，普遍地深入地进行一次检查。（二）任何有意或无意造成的假报丰产成绩事件，都是严重的错误。犯有这种错误的有关人员必须认真检讨，公开在报纸上发表；情节严重者，必须分别给以处分。
