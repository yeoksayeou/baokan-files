Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: General Park Il-u, representative of the Korean People's Army leading organ stationed in the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote an article entitled "The Powerful Korean People's Army" to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

Park Il-u wrote: The Korean People's Army was established to strive for the complete independence of the motherland, to defend the freedom and happiness of the people and the people's democratic system, and has gloriously carried out this lofty task.

Park Il-u then briefly described the brilliant achievements of the Korean People's Army since its establishment, saying: The heroic Korean People's Army has become a powerful armed force. In the just war against the armed aggression of the United States and Britain and their lackey Syngman Rhee, and for the liberation of the motherland, it has demonstrated unparalleled heroism and indomitable fortitude, and demonstrated its invincible combat power. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side, have dealt severe blows to the enemy, laid the foundation for the final victory, and plunged the enemy into a dead end. In the long-term combat, the experience of the Korean People's Army has been enriched, its tactical skills have been improved, and its equipment has also been strengthened.

Park Il-u further analyzed the reasons why the Korean People's Army has achieved brilliant victories in battle and has become stronger as it fights.

First, it is due to the superiority of the people's democratic system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The people have control of political power, and all reforms and measures of the state are in line with the interests of the people. This is the basis for the heroic struggle of the entire Korean people against aggression, and also the basis for the Korean People's Army to fight tenaciously and strive for victory.

Second, the Korean People's Army inherited the lofty aspirations of millions of patriotic martyrs and carried forward the glorious tradition of Marshal Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and formed a team with anti-Japanese patriotic warriors as the backbone and outstanding children of workers, peasants, and working people and advanced intellectuals. There is a deep class feeling between the commanders and fighters of the People's Army, and they are united in the same goal of serving the people. The commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army constantly study advanced Soviet military science and arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism.

Third, the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army have a high degree of patriotism and have displayed a staunch fighting spirit in battle. There have been hundreds of heroes such as Kim Chang-gyeol, Kim Ok-geun, Park Seok-bong, and Li Shoufu who sacrificed themselves to block the enemy's bunker loopholes. All commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army have clearly realized that the just war we are waging is not only for the independence and freedom of our country, but also for the lasting peace of the world. The Korean People's Army, with internationalist ideas and a spirit of self-sacrifice, stands at the forefront of the anti-aggression war and performs great combat missions. We are proud of this and regard it as the highest honor.

Fourth, the Korean Workers' Party is the leading and organizing force of the Korean people. Under the political and ideological education of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean People's Army has strengthened the military monocracy, established iron-like military discipline and order, and trained the People's Army into a revolutionary armed force with noble moral and political qualities. In any cruel battle, the Korean Workers' Party members can responsibly stand in a decisive position and bravely lead all the soldiers to launch a victorious struggle with a spirit of self-sacrifice. Many heroic models represented by the double heroes of the Republic, Fang Hushan, Li Xuewen, Bai Shichun, and Kim Ki-woo, are all members of the Labor Party. The prestige of the Labor Party is increasing day by day. Non-Party members believe that joining the Labor Party is the greatest glory. In the most intense battles, non-Party commanders and fighters often swear to strive for meritorious service and strive to join the Party.

Fifth, the development and growth of the Korean People's Army is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Korean people's beloved leader, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Il-sung. Whether in the period of resisting Japanese imperialism, in carrying out various democratic constructions of the Republic, or in the self-defense war against American imperialist aggression, Marshal Kim Il-sung's name is always closely linked with all the victories of the Korean people. In the difficult environment of the war, the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army are full of confidence because of the correct leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung.

Sixth, the reason why the Korean People's Army is invincible is because of the sympathy and support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people all over the world. This internationalist unity and support is a powerful guarantee for the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to finally defeat the American and British imperialist aggressors.

Park Il-u pointed out: American imperialism is now conspiring to carry out new military adventures, but the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are on high alert at all times. Any new adventurous actions by the enemy will surely suffer a shameful failure!

    朴一禹撰文纪念朝鲜人民军建军五周年
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】朝鲜人民军驻中国人民志愿军领导机关代表朴一禹将军以“强大的朝鲜人民军”为题，撰文纪念朝鲜人民军建军五周年。
    朴一禹写道：朝鲜人民军是为争取祖国的完全独立，为保卫人民的自由幸福和人民民主制度而建立起来的，并且光荣地执行了这一崇高的任务。
    朴一禹接着略述朝鲜人民军建军以来的辉煌成就说：英雄的朝鲜人民军已成为一支强大的武装力量。它在反抗美、英武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚、争取祖国解放的正义战争中，已经发挥了无比的英雄主义和不屈不挠的坚强性，显示了必胜不败的战斗威力。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，已经给敌人以严重的打击，奠定了最后胜利的基础，使敌人陷于日暮途穷之境。在长期作战中，朝鲜人民军的经验丰富了，战术技术提高了，装备也加强了。
    朴一禹进一步分析了朝鲜人民军在战斗中取得辉煌胜利和愈战愈强的原因。
    第一，是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民民主制度的优越性。人民掌握了政权，国家的一切改革和措施与人民的利益是一致的。这是全体朝鲜人民英勇反抗侵略的斗争的基础，也是朝鲜人民军顽强战斗、争取胜利的基础。
    第二，朝鲜人民军继承了千万爱国先烈的崇高遗志和发扬了金日成元帅抗日游击战的光荣传统，并且以抗日爱国勇士为骨干，以工人、农民、劳动人民的优秀儿女和先进知识分子组成的队伍。人民军指挥官和战斗员之间有着深厚的阶级感情，在为人民服务的同一目的下团结一致。朝鲜人民军指挥官、战斗员不断研究苏联先进军事科学，并以马克思列宁主义武装了自己的头脑。
    第三，朝鲜人民军指挥官、战斗员有高度的爱国主义思想，在战斗中发挥了刚毅的战斗精神，出现了成千成百的舍身堵塞敌人碉堡枪眼的英雄金昌杰、金玉根、朴石峰、李守福等。朝鲜人民军全体指挥官、战斗员已经清楚地认识到我们所进行的正义战争不仅为了我国的独立和自由，也是为世界的持久和平。朝鲜人民军以国际主义思想，以自我牺牲精神，站在反侵略战争的前哨，执行伟大的战斗任务。我们为此而骄傲，并引为无尚光荣。
    第四，朝鲜劳动党是朝鲜人民的领导力量和组织力量。朝鲜人民军在劳动党的政治思想教育下，加强了军事一元制，确立了钢铁般的军事纪律和秩序，使人民军锻炼成为一支具有崇高的道德、政治素质的革命武装队伍。朝鲜劳动党员不论在任何残酷的战斗中，都能负责地站在决定性的位置上以自我牺牲的精神，勇敢地带领全体军人展开胜利的斗争。以共和国双重英雄方虎山、李学文、白士淳、金基禹等为代表的许多英雄模范都是劳动党员。劳动党的威信正日益提高。非党群众都认为参加劳动党是最大的光荣，在战斗最激烈的时候，常有非党指挥官、战斗员宣誓争取立功，争取入党。
    第五，朝鲜人民军的发展壮大，是与朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖、朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅的英明领导分不开的。金日成元帅的名字不论在反抗日本帝国主义的时期，在进行共和国各种民主建设时期，和在反对美帝国主义侵略的自卫战争中，总是和朝鲜人民的一切胜利紧密地连结在一起。在战争处于艰苦的环境中，朝鲜人民军指挥官、战斗员，由于有金日成元帅的正确领导而充满信心。
    第六，朝鲜人民军之所以不可战胜，是由于有以苏联为首的和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支援。这种国际主义的团结和支援，是鼓舞朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军最后战胜美、英帝国主义侵略者的有力保障。
    朴一禹指出：美帝国主义现在正阴谋进行新的军事冒险，但英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军时刻都在严阵以待，敌人的任何新的冒险行动必定要遭到可耻的失败！
