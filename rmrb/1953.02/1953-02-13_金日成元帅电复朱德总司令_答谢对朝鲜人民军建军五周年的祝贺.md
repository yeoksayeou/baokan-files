Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 12th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a reply telegram to General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, thanking him for his congratulations on the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The telegram reads as follows:

General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to you and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on behalf of all officers and men of the Korean People's Army and in my own name for your congratulations on the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army!

The great victory in the anti-American war over the past two years and more has been created by the fighting unity of the Korean and Chinese people's forces forged with blood. I believe that the solidarity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese people's forces will become even stronger in the future, and any conspiracies and adventurous attempts of the American armed aggressors to expand the war will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

Glory to the Korean and Chinese people and the Korean and Chinese people's forces who are fighting against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors.

Kim Il-sung
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
February 11, 1953

    金日成元帅电复朱德总司令
    答谢对朝鲜人民军建军五周年的祝贺
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅，复电感谢中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军在朝鲜人民军建军节的祝贺。电文如下：中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军：
    对于您在朝鲜人民军建军五周年纪念节的祝贺，我代表朝鲜人民军全体官兵并以我个人名义向您和中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员表示衷心的感谢！
    两年多以来，抗美战争的伟大胜利，是由朝中人民部队以鲜血结成的战斗的团结力量所造成的。我相信今后朝中人民部队的团结友谊愈加巩固，美国武装侵略者的任何扩大战争的阴谋和政策的冒险企图，一定遭受到可耻的失败。
    光荣属于反对共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略者而斗争的朝中人民和朝中人民部队。
                                朝鲜人民军最高司令官　金日成
                                        一九五三年二月十一日
