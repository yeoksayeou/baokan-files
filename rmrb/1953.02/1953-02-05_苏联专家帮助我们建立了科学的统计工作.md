    Soviet Experts Helped Us Establish Scientific Statistical Work
    Yang Jianbai
    In the past three years, with the help of Soviet statistical experts, the Northeast region has initially established scientific statistical work.
    Before the arrival of the Soviet experts, our understanding of statistics was very superficial and very naive. At that time, we regarded statistics as simple calculation work and did not understand that statistics is a powerful weapon for understanding society, a means of managing the country and implementing state supervision, and a tool for promoting the planning of the national economy. We also did not truly understand that measuring the level of production development of a country mainly uses the gross output value as an indicator, let alone how to calculate the gross output value. As for distinguishing between industry and agriculture, we only judged it based on habits and common sense, and did not deeply understand its different fundamental characteristics. For example, we habitually always put agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in the same category. However, large-scale logging and fishing, from the perspective of production nature, do not belong to (or are the same as) agriculture, but belong to (or are the same as) industrial production. In short, we had no basic knowledge of Marxist-Leninist statistics at that time. The help of Soviet statistical experts started from enlightenment work in this situation.
    However, after three years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the concrete assistance of Soviet experts with a high degree of internationalism, the statistical staff in the Northeast have initially learned some statistical knowledge, accepted advanced Soviet experiences, and applied them to the specific environment of the Northeast, initially establishing scientific statistical work. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    In the past, the Northeast did not have a national system of statistical organizations, and the statistical institutions of business departments were also incomplete. Soviet experts told us that to establish standardized statistics, we must be based on sound organizations. Now statistical organizations of the national system and major business departments have been established, and the number of professional statistical cadres, part-time statistical cadres, and recorders is more than five times that of the spring of 1950. In this way, conditions have been created for regular and standardized statistical work.
    In the past, various departments abused forms, requested materials arbitrarily, and only requested them when needed, discarded them after use, and requested them again when needed. Soviet experts told us that we must establish a regular statistical reporting system to correct this phenomenon, and we must master the weapon of statistical forms to achieve the unity of statistical work. With the specific help of Soviet experts, we have now formulated more than 200 kinds of statistical forms for industry, agriculture, capital construction, and trade; and reviewed and approved more than 800 kinds of statistical forms to meet the needs of business departments. In this way, the phenomenon of abusing forms has been basically overcome; at the same time, through the formulated monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, a relatively complete and unified statistical reporting system has been established in the main national economic sectors. The implementation of this regular statistical reporting system can basically grasp the situation of the main national economic sectors as the basis for determining policies, formulating plans, and inspecting plans.
    However, at the beginning of establishing the statistical reporting system, our statistical figures were not timely, inaccurate, and lacked analysis, so some departments considered statistics a "burden". With the help of Soviet experts, we also established rapid monthly and ten-day reports to reflect the situation and check the plan in a timely manner, and recently we have further established telegram ten-day reports. Soviet experts also personally checked the correctness of statistical figures by inspecting one factory and one store, and taught us how to conduct such inspections, which made the accuracy of statistical figures gradually improve. In addition, Soviet experts repeatedly explained how to conduct economic analysis and write written explanations, and made examples to help us learn. In this way, we not only understood the importance of economic analysis, but also gradually learned how to do economic analysis.
    In the past, we often adopted unscientific or incompletely scientific methods for survey statistical work. After the Soviet experts came, we learned scientific methods. Here are two simple examples:
    First, when measuring the historical development level of the national economy, it is very difficult to solve the problem of how to eliminate the impact of price changes. After the Soviet experts arrived, they proposed to use "constant prices" to measure the historical production development level. Under the guidance of this principle, we concentrated our efforts to collect and compile historical data with the product prices of 1943 as "constant prices", thereby determining a measurement and comparison scale for formulating plans and checking plans.
    Second, regarding agricultural output survey work. In the past, our agricultural output figures were estimated by looking at the harvest. With the help of Soviet experts, in the past three years, we have adopted the scientific method of "dividing types, selecting typical examples, and conducting actual harvesting and measurement" to conduct typical surveys, and then use the typical survey data, combined with the comprehensive statistical figures of the sown area, to estimate the yield of crops in the entire Northeast. Although, because we are not good at using this powerful weapon, there were still phenomena of overestimation or underestimation when calculating output in 1951 and 1950, however, due to repeatedly summarizing these experiences and lessons and studying specific implementation methods, the agricultural output survey in 1952 was close to the truth. For example, the figure of fixed output in Jilin Province in 1952 was only 1.5 percent lower than the survey figure, while Liaodong Province was only 2 percent higher. Therefore, this method has been recognized by all parties as a scientific method.
    In the past three years, the help of Soviet experts has achieved such great results, which is a fact that everyone can see; but its more profound significance is more than that.
    First, these facts show that we must "take Russia as our teacher" in statistical work as in other work. The advanced statistical experience of the Soviet Union is rich and completely correct, and we must learn from the Soviet experience well.
    Second, these facts show that to lead the national economy to develop in a planned and proportional manner, we must use statistics, this "powerful weapon for understanding society," to reflect the objective economic development process that does not depend on people's will, and then use it to determine policies, formulate plans, check plans, and promote national construction. Conversely, if we leave this weapon, the national economic plan will be unrealistic and it will be impossible to accurately check the implementation of the plan.
    Third, these facts show that the help of Soviet experts has accelerated the development speed of our statistical construction. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union tells us that new democratic countries must build scientific Marxist-Leninist statistics. The specific implementation of this statistics is to implement unified and centralized leadership, master the weapons of statistical forms and statistical methods, establish a regular and systematic statistical reporting system on a ten-day, monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, and ensure that statistical data comes from all aspects. It is required that statistical reports are accurate and timely, establish a written explanation system, and carry out economic analysis to give play to the inspection and supervision role of statistical work. Without the help of Soviet experts, it would take us an unknown amount of detours and years to explore this law from our own work!
    However, it must be pointed out that in the past three years, we have not done enough in learning from Soviet experts. Scientific statistical work is only in its initial stage, or it can be said that it is only a beginning, and it is far from meeting the needs of the vigorous development of national construction.
    Soviet experts have suggested to us that we must vigorously strengthen basic construction statistics and labor statistics, but at present these two tasks are still relatively weak; Soviet experts have told us that material balance statistics are very important and must be carried out, but we have not been able to do so; Soviet experts often emphasize that statistics must play a certain organizational and guiding role in the national economic accounting system, but at present we have not done enough in this regard; Soviet experts have told us that we must strengthen statistical discipline to ensure the integrity and seriousness of statistical work, but at present phenomena such as delaying the submission date, being careless and perfunctory, and reporting false figures in violation of statistical discipline still exist. All these suggestions of Soviet experts need us to continue to work hard to learn in the future and promote their realization. Therefore, our statistical personnel should never be satisfied with the preliminary knowledge they have learned, and should never be satisfied with the current situation of statistical work, but should tirelessly learn from Soviet experts, continue to promote the progress of statistical work, and further strive to build scientific Marxist-Leninist statistics to welcome the large-scale economic construction of the whole country.

    苏联专家帮助我们建立了科学的统计工作
    杨坚白
    三年来在苏联统计专家的帮助之下，东北区已经初步地建立起科学的统计工作了。
    在苏联专家未来之前，我们对于统计的认识是非常肤浅、非常幼稚的。当时我们把统计看成是简单的计算工作，不了解统计是认识社会的有力武器之
    一，是管理国家、实现国家监督的一种手段，是促进国民经济计划化的一种工具。也不真正了解衡量
    一个国家的生产发展水平，主要是用生产总值这个指标，更不要说如何计算生产总值了。至于区分工业和农业，只是凭习惯、凭常识来判断，并不深刻了解其不同的根本特点。例如，我们在习惯上，总是把农业、林业、水产等相提并论，然而大规模的森林采伐和捕鱼，从生产性质来说，并不属于（或同于）农业，而是属于（或同于）工业生产的。总之，我们那时对马克思列宁主义的统计连起码的知识都没有。苏联统计专家对我们的帮助，就是在这种情况下从启发工作做起的。
    但是，经过三年的光景，在党和人民政府的领导之下，在苏联专家们以高度国际主义精神的具体帮助之下，东北统计工作人员已初步学到了一些统计知识，并接受苏联先进经验，运用到东北的具体环境中来，初步地建立了科学的统计工作。这主要表现在如下几个方面：
    过去，东北没有国家系统的统计组织，业务部门的统计机构也残缺不全。苏联专家告诉我们，要建立正规化的统计，必须以健全的组织为基础。现在国家系统和主要业务部门的统计机构都已建立起来，专业统计干部、兼职统计干部和记录人员为一九五○年春的五倍多。这样，就为经常地、正规地展开统计工作创造了条件。
    过去，各部门滥发表格，乱要材料，而且是现用现要，用过一丢，再用再要。苏联专家告诉我们，必须建立起正规的统计报告制度来纠正这种现象，必须掌握统计表格这一武器，来达到统计工作的统
    一。经过苏联专家具体帮助，现在我们已制订工业、农业、基本建设、贸易等统计表格二百多种；为满足业务部门的需要，又审定了八百余种统计表格。这样，就基本上克服了滥发表格的现象；同时，通过制订的月报、季报、年报，在主要的国民经济部门建立起比较完整的、统一的统计报告制度。这种经常的统计报告制度的贯彻，就可以基本上掌握各主要国民经济部门的情况，作为确定政策、制定计划、检查计划的依据。
    但在建立统计报告制度之初，我们的统计数字不及时、不正确，又缺乏分析，因而若干部门认为统计是一种“负担”。由于苏联专家的帮助，我们又建立了及时反映情况、检查计划的简速月报和简速旬报，最近更进一步建立了电报旬报。苏联专家又亲自动手，按一个工厂、一个商店来检查统计数字的正确性，并教给我们如何进行这种检查，这就使统计数字的正确性日渐提高。此外，苏联专家曾反复讲解如何进行经济分析和写文字说明，并做出样子来帮助我们学习，这样，我们不仅懂得了经济分析的重要性，而且逐渐学会了怎样做经济分析。
    以前，我们对于调查统计工作，常常是采取不科学或不完全科学的方法来进行。苏联专家来了后，我们才学会了科学的方法。在这里，举两个简单的例子：
    第一、在测定国民经济的历史发展水平时，如何消除物价变动的影响，是很不易解决的问题。苏联专家来到之后，就提出要用“不变价格”测定历史的生产发展水平，在这一原则指导之下，我们集中力量，搜集并编制了以一九四三年产品价格为“不变价格”的历史资料，从而给编制计划、检查计划确定了计量的、比较的尺度。
    第二、关于农产量调查工作。过去我们的农产量数字，是看年成来估计的。经过苏联专家的帮助，三年来我们采取了“划分类型、选择典型、实割实测”的科学方法做典型调查，然后根据典型调查资料，结合播种面积的全面统计数字，来推算全东北的农作物产量。虽然由于我们还不善于运用这一个有力的武器，在一九五一年、一九五○年计算产量时还有偏高偏低的现象，然而由于反复总结这些经验教训，研究具体贯彻的办法，一九五二年农产量调查，已接近真实。例如，吉林省一九五二年定产的数字，较调查数字只低百分之一点五，辽东省则仅大百分之二。因此，这一方法，已经是被各方面所公认的科学方法了。
    三年来，苏联专家对我们的帮助，有了如此巨大的成绩，这是人人都能看到的事实；但其更深刻的意义尚不止此。
    第一、这些事实说明了我们在统计工作上也如同其他工作一样，必须“以俄为师”。苏联先进的统计经验是丰富的，完全正确的，我们必须很好地向苏联经验学习。
    第二、这些事实说明了要领导国民经济有计划地按比例地发展，就必须运用统计这个“认识社会的有力武器”，来反映不以人们的意志为转移的客观的经济发展过程，然后据以确定政策，编制计划，检查计划，推动国家建设。反之，如果离开了这一武器，则国民经济计划就将不切实际，也无法准确地检查计划执行的情况。
    第三、这些事实说明了苏联专家的帮助加速了我们统计建设的发展速度。苏联的先进经验告诉我们，新民主主义国家必须建设科学的马克思列宁主义的统计。这种统计的具体实施，就是要实行统一集中的领导，掌握统计表格和统计方法这一武器，建立经常的有系统的按旬、按月、按季、按年的统计报告制度，保证统计资料从各个方面源源而来。要求统计表报做到正确及时，建立文字说明制度，并展开经济分析，发挥统计工作的检查监督作用。如果没有苏联专家帮助，要靠我们自己从工作中摸索出这一规律来，就不知要走多少弯路，要费多少年的时间！
    但是，必须指出，三年来我们在向苏联专家学习上，还做得很不够，科学的统计工作，仅仅是初具规模，或者说只是一个开端，还远远赶不上国家建设蓬勃发展的需要。
    苏联专家曾经向我们建议，必须大力加强基本建设统计和劳动统计，而目前我们这两项工作仍是较弱的；苏联专家曾告诉我们，物资平衡统计很重要，必须开展起来，但我们尚未能进行；苏联专家经常强调，统计必须在国民经济计算体系中发挥其
    一定的组织和指导作用，而目前我们在这一方面做得很不够；苏联专家告诉我们，必须加强统计纪律，以确保统计工作的整体性、严肃性，而目前拖延报送日期，草率马虎以及报假数字等违反统计纪律的现象，仍然存在。苏联专家所有这些建议，都有待于我们今后继续努力学习，并促其实现。所以我们统计人员决不应满足于所学到的初步知识，决不应满足于统计工作的现状，而是要毫不倦怠地向苏联专家学习，继续不断地推动统计工作的前进，进一步为建设科学的马克思列宁主义的统计而奋斗，迎接全国的大规模的经济建设。
