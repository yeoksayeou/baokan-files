Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and "Mutual Security Agency" Director Stassen are rushing to inspect various Western European countries, overseeing the "unified" European movement that is in danger of collapsing due to popular opposition and contradictions among the ruling groups.

Dulles and Stassen arrived in Rome on January 31st, met with Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, and the next day went to Paris to meet with French government leaders. On the 3rd, they rushed to London.

Dulles' trip to Europe is because the U.S. plan for a "unified" Europe is in a critical situation. According to a report by the United Press, Dulles had instructed U.S. diplomats in Western European countries in advance to prepare answers to questions such as: "What is the possibility of making the European Army plan a reality?" "What is the prospect of Europe establishing a genuine European Union?" "What is the current mood in Europe?..." The United States has vigorously promoted these plans for a "unified" Europe for several years, boasting about them extensively, but now Dulles has to personally go to Western Europe to find out such basic questions, which is naturally a very unpleasant thing for the Americans. Therefore, before leaving, Dulles first delivered a thunderous speech on the radio to the Western European ruling groups. Immediately after stepping off the plane at Rome airport, he declared that the United States was "most interested" in the so-called "European Defense Group," which mainly involves the establishment of a West German aggressive army. According to information that has already been revealed, Dulles directly exerted pressure on the heads of state of France and Italy during talks with officials from the two countries, demanding that they act quickly according to the U.S. plan. An Associated Press report said that Dulles warned French Foreign Minister Bidault and Defense Minister Pleven that the French government "must show encouraging progress (in approving the 'European Army' agreement)."

However, Dulles' mission is destined to be a thankless task. On the very day that Dulles departed from Washington, a United Press London dispatch gloomily predicted: Dulles would "have to spend a lot of lip service" in this mission to save the "gradually collapsing" "unity" plan; he would encounter "trouble in Paris, London, and Bonn," and in Brussels, he would "feel that Belgium is not so eager"; and Luxembourg "will probably just follow the tide."

The actual situation proves that Dulles' trip is not smooth everywhere he goes. An Agence France-Presse report pointed out that the general comment of the Italian bourgeois newspapers on Dulles' trip to Europe is that "Western European countries are both happy and worried." In Paris, according to the United Press, Dulles had to immediately "try to stabilize the emotions of the French leaders" after getting off the plane; moreover, senior U.S. diplomats in Western Europe told him that although the future of the "unity" plan was said to be not "hopeless," it was at least "not bright."

Although Dulles' high-handed methods made the slavish French government leaders flustered, they deepened the dissatisfaction of the French bourgeoisie with the United States. Even the traditionally pro-American Paris "Le Figaro" could not help but publicly express resentment, saying: American "aid should not make Europe a dependency of the United States, and should not give our ally (the United States) the right to speak to us in a commanding tone."

Waiting for Dulles in London was even greater "trouble." British officials have unambiguously told Dulles in advance that Britain is not prepared to participate in any such "alliance" of Europe instigated by the United States that requires European participating countries to surrender their sovereignty.

    美国的“欧洲防务集团”侵略计划有破灭危险
    杜勒斯赶往西欧对英法等国施用压力
    【新华社四日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯和“共同安全署”署长史塔生，正在匆匆巡视西欧各国，督导因为人民的反对和统治集团之间的矛盾而有破灭危险的“统一”欧洲运动。
    杜勒斯和史塔生在一月三十一日到达罗马，和意大利总理加斯贝利会谈，次日就前往巴黎，和法国政府首脑会晤，三日又赶往伦敦。
    杜勒斯这次欧洲之行，是因为美国的“统一”欧洲的计划已临危境。据合众社消息说，杜勒斯事先就训令美国驻西欧各国外交官准备回答这样一些问题：“使欧洲军计划成为现实的可能性如何？”“欧洲建立真正的欧洲联盟的前途如何？”“现在欧洲的情绪如何？……”美国大力推行这些“统一”欧洲的计划已经有好几年了，也吹得天花乱坠，但现在杜勒斯不得不亲自到西欧去弄清楚这样一些起码的问题，对美国人来说自然是一件极不愉快的事。所以，杜勒斯在临行前，先就在广播演说里对西欧国家统治集团大发雷霆。刚在罗马机场走下飞机，就声明，美国所“最感兴趣”的就是以建立西德侵略军队为主要内容的所谓“欧洲防务集团”。根据已经透露的情况，杜勒斯在和法、意官方的会谈中，对两国政府首脑人物直接使用压力，要他们赶快按照美国计划行事。美联社消息说，杜勒斯曾警告法国外长皮杜尔和国防部长普利文，法国政府“必须（在批准“欧洲军”协定方面）表现令人鼓舞的进展”。
    但是杜勒斯此行的任务注定是吃力不讨好的工作。就在杜勒斯从华盛顿出发那天，合众社伦敦消息就黯淡地预告：杜勒斯在他这次挽救“渐渐垮台了”的“统一”计划的差事中将“要化费很多唇舌”；会碰到“巴黎、伦敦和波恩的麻烦”，在布鲁塞尔“会感到比利时并不那么热切希望”；而卢森堡“大约也将随波逐流”。
    实际情况证明杜勒斯所到之处都并不顺利。法新社的消息指出，意大利资产阶级报纸对于杜勒斯欧洲之行的普遍的评论是，“西欧各国亦喜亦忧”。在巴黎，据合众社透露，杜勒斯下飞机之后就不得不马上“设法安定法国领袖们的情绪”；而且，美国在西欧的高级外交官告诉他，“统一”计划的前途虽据说还不是“无希望”，至少也是“不光明”。
    杜勒斯的高压手段虽然使得法国的奴性十足的政府首脑手忙脚乱，但是却加深了法国资产阶级中对美国的不满情绪。甚至一向亲美的巴黎“费加罗报”也忍不住公开表示怨恨说：美国的“援助不应该使欧洲成为美国的附庸，不能使我们的盟国（美国）有权利用命令的口吻对我们讲话”。
    在伦敦等待着杜勒斯的是更大的“麻烦”。英国官方已毫不含糊地预先告诉杜勒斯，英国不准备参加美国所策动的任何这类要求欧洲参与国交出主权的欧洲的“联盟”。
