North China Region's Steel Industry Departments Unify Basic Construction Plans in Beijing
Implementing the Policy of Concentrated Use of Funds and Key Construction

    The work of compiling the basic construction plan for the North China Region's steel industry has been completed. This plan compilation was carried out under the direct leadership of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. Therefore, the content of the plan fully implements the correct policy of the central government's concentrated use of funds and focusing on key construction. The method of centralized and unified compilation of the basic construction plan in Beijing has many advantages. It enables the responsible personnel of various factories and mines to meticulously consider the necessity and feasibility of each project, starting from the overall national construction requirements. This powerfully overcomes the departmentalism of some factories and mines that "compete for investment." After discussions by the responsible personnel of various factories and mines, many unnecessary engineering projects in Tianjin, Tangshan and other steel plants were finally reduced, and investments in Yangquan and Shijiazhuang were cancelled. During the discussion of the plan, the responsible personnel of these factories and mines also carried out balancing work in terms of design, construction, equipment, and materials based on the overall draft plan. For example, in terms of construction manpower, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant transferred surplus civil construction and installation personnel to support the basic construction of Shijingshan and East China Iron and Steel Plants. The original plan for the new machine repair workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was also automatically removed from the entire plan because it did not meet the requirements of long-term construction. This greatly strengthens future planning management and ensures 100% completion of state tasks. In the process of compiling the plan, in order to thoroughly implement the central government's policy, they also organized a review group including engineers and technicians to conduct a careful review of each plan.

    In the process of compiling the plan, these factories and mines also paid attention to the work of assembling and adjusting design and construction forces. Currently, the design organization has been adjusted; the Taiyuan and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants have established engineering companies and concentrated more than 6,000 employees for winter training. This avoids the phenomenon of many cross-year projects caused by only compiling plans in the past, without regard to assembling design and construction forces. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北区钢铁工业部门在北京统一编制基本建设计划
    贯彻了集中使用资金和重点建设的方针
    华北区钢铁工业基本建设计划的编制工作已经结束。这次计划的编制工作是在中央重工业部钢铁工业局直接领导下进行的，因此，计划的内容完全贯彻了中央集中使用资金和有重点建设的正确方针。基本建设计划采取在北京集中和统一编制的方法，有很多优点。它使各个工厂矿山主管人员从整个国家建设要求出发，缜密地考虑每件工程的必要性和可能性。这就有力地克服了某些工厂矿山“争投资”的本位主义思想。经过各厂矿主管人员的讨论，最后天津、唐山等钢厂许多不必要的工程项目削减了，阳泉、石家庄的投资取消了。这些厂矿主管人员在讨论计划时，还根据总的计划草案进行了设计、施工、设备、材料等方面的平衡工作。例如在施工力量方面，太原钢铁厂把多余的土木建筑和安装等工程人员，调出来支援石景山和华东钢铁厂的基本建设。石景山钢铁厂原来制定的新建机修厂房的计划，因为不合于长远建设的要求，也自动从整个计划中抹掉了。这样就大大加强了今后的计划管理，保证百分之百地完成国家任务。在编制计划中，为了彻底执行中央方针，他们还组织了包括工程师、技术人员的审核组，对各项计划进行了认真地审核。
    这些厂矿在编制计划中，还同时注意了集结和调整设计、施工力量的工作。目前设计组织已经过调整；太原、石景山两钢铁厂成立了工程公司，并集中了六千多职工进行冬训。这样就避免了过去那种只管编制计划，不顾集结设计和施工力量而造成许多跨年度工程的现象。　（新华社）
