    Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Health Work
    The case of Shen Guidin, the former director of the Suxian Special District Health Institute in Jiangsu, who framed cadre Hou Jinshan, as published in today's newspaper, is another serious case revealed in the health department following the Ji Kaifu and Dou Duanxiao incidents. Hou Jinshan was retaliated against and framed by Shen Guidin and others for reporting the chaos and corruption of his unit to higher leading organs. His work was revoked, his party membership was revoked, and he was imprisoned for eleven months. It was not until the "Three-Anti" movement began that he was restored to work and party membership; however, the principal and accessory criminals involved in this case have not yet received appropriate punishment. This incident, like the Ji Kaifu and Dou Duanxiao incidents, not only shows that some health administrative organs have become places for harboring dirt and filth, but also shows that there is an extremely serious bureaucratic work style in the local party and government leading organs.
    The successive occurrence of these cases in the health department is not accidental. Although the work of health departments at all levels has improved a lot in the past three years and has made many achievements, playing a great role in implementing the three major principles of "serving workers, peasants and soldiers", "prevention first" and "unity of Chinese and Western medicine", carrying out patriotic health campaigns, and crushing the enemy's germ warfare, the shortcomings of the health department's work are still very serious. During the "Three-Anti" movement, before and after the "Three-Anti" movement, many problems were exposed in the health departments of various places. For example, the lack of ideological leadership and specific leadership, the lack of a political atmosphere and a critical atmosphere, the lack of democratic life, the lack of attention to the leadership of the Party, detachment from the masses, and even sectarianism and unprincipled disputes are all examples. Most local party committees also do not pay much attention to leading the work of the health department, and the party organizations and responsible cadres of many health agencies also do not pay much attention to the Party's leadership over health work. Under such circumstances, bureaucratic germs have grown in many health agencies, and intolerable corrupt phenomena have appeared. The chaotic state of the East China Health Bureau is also proof of this. If Cui Yitian, the director of the East China Health Bureau, does not correct his mistakes in a timely and thorough manner, and allows his bureaucratic leadership style and the bad situation of discord between superiors and subordinates to develop, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, leading cadres of health departments at all levels must seriously learn profound lessons from the Ji Kaifu incident, the Dou Duanxiao incident, and the Hou Jinshan incident.
    The main culprits in the Ji Kaifu incident, the Dou Duanxiao incident, and the Hou Jinshan incident were all responsible cadres of health administrative leading organs, and most of them were Communist Party members. Not only did they not have the slightest taste of Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres, but they also completely lost the qualities that an ordinary citizen of New China should have. They are the deadly enemies of the Party and the people. They were so arrogant and complacent, and so dismissive of everything, that they simply regarded the state health organs as their own independent kingdoms, in which they could do whatever they wanted, and they became the rulers of this independent kingdom. Even though their agencies were full of festering sores, they only allowed praise and no criticism. "Those who obey me will prosper, and those who oppose me will perish" - this is their "cadre policy." They could win over private individuals, embezzle and engage in malfeasance, and do whatever they wanted, but they would not allow lower-level cadres to say a word. Anyone who wanted to report the situation to higher leading organs or party newspapers would be labeled with a big hat. Good cadres like Ji Kaifu, Dou Duanxiao, and Hou Jinshan, who were loyal to revolutionary work, loyal to the people's cause, and dared to expose and criticize, were subjected to their cruel persecution.
    The reason why these bad elements can infiltrate into the state health organs, and dare to be so lawless and commit all kinds of evils, is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic work style of the local party committees. These cases reflect that the Party's leadership and education for these health administrative organs and their responsible persons are shockingly weak, which is the crux of the problem. In the development process of the Ji Kaifu incident and the Dou Duanxiao incident, we never saw the leadership of the local party organizations, nor did we smell the breath of the Party. Where did the Party's principles, the Party's standpoints and viewpoints, the Party's policies, and the Party's discipline go? We only saw the local party organizations dragging their feet, perfunctorily, and even listening to only one side of the story, failing to distinguish right from wrong, and intentionally or unintentionally acting as accomplices in suppressing criticism and violating laws and discipline. It was not until the higher party committee repeatedly ordered and urged inspections that the cases were dealt with seriously. Hou Jinshan also reported twice to the Suxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China after being illegally arrested, but he did not receive a timely response. If this situation is not changed, how can we guarantee that similar cases will not continue to occur? Therefore, only by thoroughly eliminating bureaucracy from the party committees of various places, only by strengthening the leadership of the Party, only by using the invincible power of the Party and the masses to constantly combat evil and support righteousness, and only by improving the democratic life of the organs and strengthening the ties between leaders and the masses, can we guarantee the continuous progress of our people's cause. All our state organs must do this, and our health organs are no exception.
    The party organizations in the party committees and state organs of various localities must earnestly accept the profound lessons of the Ji Kaifu incident, the Dou Duanxiao incident, and the Hou Jinshan incident, and quickly correct the mistake of not paying attention to leading the work of the health department. The health cause is related to the health of all the people and cadres, and related to the progress of national economic construction. The Party must strengthen the leadership of this important cause from the main links of work plans, guidelines, policies, and cadre management, and earnestly lead and inspect the work of the health department's party organizations to help them improve their work situation, so as to meet the great tasks of the period of large-scale national construction.
    In order to improve the current situation of the health department, the party committees of various localities must immediately guide the party organizations of the health agencies to mobilize all health workers and cadres, earnestly discuss the resolution of the Second National Health Conference held in December last year, and in light of their own circumstances, launch criticism, check work, affirm achievements, expose shortcomings, and especially criticize all kinds of bad work styles of being divorced from the masses, correct the thinking of cadres, formulate methods for correction, and raise the political and ideological level of all health workers a step further. Then, according to the local actual situation, work plans should be formulated in a realistic manner, and through appropriate discussions and studies, the plans should be turned into everyone's actions. Secondly, we must vigorously assist the party organizations of the health agencies to thoroughly understand the situation of cadres, so as to rectify the health team in a planned and step-by-step manner, strengthen their political and current affairs study and professional study, and constantly improve their work level. We must ensure the implementation of correct cadre policies, promote democracy, fully carry out criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, improve the enthusiasm of all party member cadres and non-party cadres, and pay attention to the rectification and improvement of the work of party and league organizations. At the same time, party committees at all levels should establish necessary systems to ensure regular leadership and inspection of health work, ensure that the party organizations of the health departments strictly implement the Party's principles, guidelines, policies, and all resolutions, and resolutely oppose the state of disorganization and indiscipline. As long as these tasks are done well, the health institutions will be greatly improved, and bad elements will have no loopholes to exploit. This is the fundamental way to eliminate illegal and undisciplined events.

### 加强党对卫生工作的领导

    加强党对卫生工作的领导
    今天本报发表的江苏宿县专区卫生院前任院长沈桂鼎陷害干部侯金山的事件，是在卫生部门中继纪凯夫事件和窦端孝事件之后，又一次被揭发的严重案件。侯金山因为向上级领导机关反映了本单位混乱腐败的情况而受到沈桂鼎等的报复诬陷，工作被撤销了，党籍被开除了，本人被关在牢里达十一个月之久；直到“三反”运动开始，他才被恢复工作和党籍；而与此案有关的主从罪犯，至今仍未受到适当的惩处。这一事件，正如纪凯夫事件和窦端孝事件一样，不仅说明了某些卫生行政机关已经成为藏垢纳污的场所，而且说明了当地党政领导机关中存在着极为严重的官僚主义作风。
    卫生部门中的这些案件的接连发生，并不是偶然的。各级卫生部门的工作，尽管在过去三年中有了不少改进，做出了不少成绩，在执行“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”三大原则，开展爱国卫生运动，粉碎敌人的细菌战等项工作中发挥了很大作用，但是，卫生部门的工作缺点仍然是非常严重的。在“三反”运动中，在“三反”运动以前和以后，各地卫生部门都暴露了不少问题。例如缺乏思想领导和具体领导，缺乏政治空气和批评空气，缺乏民主生活，不重视党的领导、脱离群众，有的甚至闹宗派，闹无原则纠纷等等都是。多数地方党委也不大注意领导卫生部门的工作，许多卫生机关的党组织及其负责干部，也不大重视党对卫生事业的领导。在这样的情况下，不少卫生机关里就生长了官僚主义的毒菌，出现了不能容忍的腐朽现象。华东卫生局的混乱状态也是一个证明。华东卫生局局长崔义田如不及时彻底纠正自己的错误，听任自己的官僚主义的领导作风和上下离心离德的恶劣情况发展下去，后果也将是不堪设想的。因此各级卫生部门的领导干部必须认真地从纪凯夫事件、窦端孝事件和侯金山事件中吸取严重的教训。
    纪凯夫事件、窦端孝事件和侯金山事件的主犯都是卫生行政领导机关的负责干部，而且大都是共党产员。他们非但没有一点共党产员、革命干部的气味，而且完全失去了一个新中国普通公民应有的品质。他们是党和人民的死敌。他们那样骄傲自满，目空一切，简直把国家卫生机关当作他们自己为所欲为的独立王国，他们俨然成了这个独立王国的统治者。尽管在他们的机关里长满了溃烂的脓包，他们也只许歌颂，不许批评。“顺我者存，逆我者亡”——这便是他们的“干部政策”。他们可以拉拢私人，贪污舞弊，为所欲为，却不准下级干部哼一声。谁要向上级领导机关或党报反映情况，他就给你戴上一顶大帽子，像纪凯夫、窦端孝、侯金山那样忠于革命工作、忠于人民事业、敢于揭发和批评的好干部，就遭受到他们的残酷迫害。
    这些坏分子所以能够混入国家卫生机关，而又敢于那样无法无天，为非作歹，是跟当地党委的严重官僚主义作风分不开的。这几件案子反映了党对这些卫生行政机关及其负责人的领导和教育薄弱到惊人的程度，这是问题的关键。在纪凯夫事件和窦端孝事件的发展过程中，我们始终看不到当地党组织的领导，闻不到党的气息。党的原则，党的立场观点，党的政策，党的纪律，到底到哪里去了？我们只看到当地党的组织在那里拖拖拉拉，敷敷衍衍，甚至偏听偏信，不辨是非，有意无意地做了压制批评、违法乱纪者的帮凶。直到上级党委三令五申，督促检查，案子才得到严正的处理。侯金山在被非法拘捕后也曾向中共宿县地委报告两次，都没有及时得到回声。这种情况如不改变，我们拿什么来保证类似案件不会继续发生？因此，只有从各地党委中彻底肃清官僚主义，只有加强党的领导，只有用党和群众的无敌力量，经常打击邪气，扶植正气，健全机关的民主生活，密切领导和群众的联系，我们人民的事业才能取得不断前进的保证。我们的一切国家机关都必须这样，我们的卫生机关也不能例外。
    各地党委和国家机关中的党的组织必须认真接受纪凯夫事件、窦端孝事件和侯金山事件的深刻教训，迅速纠正不注意领导卫生部门工作的错误。卫生事业关系全体人民和干部的健康，关系国家经济建设的进展，党必须从工作计划、方针、政策、干部管理等主要环节上，加强对这一重要事业的领导，切实领导和检查卫生部门党组织的工作，帮助他们改进工作状况，以迎接国家大规模建设时期的伟大任务。
    为了改进目前卫生部门的情况，各地党委必须立即指导卫生机关党组织，发动全体卫生工作干部，切实讨论去年十二月举行的第二届全国卫生会议的决议，并联系本身情况，展开批评，检查工作，肯定成绩，揭发缺点，特别要批判各种各样的脱离群众的坏作风，端正干部思想，订出纠正的办法，把全体卫生工作人员的政治思想水平提高一步。然后要根据当地实际情况，实事求是地订出工作计划，并通过适当的讨论和学习，使计划变成大家的行动。其次，要大力协助卫生机关的党组织彻底了解干部情况，以便有计划、有步骤地整顿卫生队伍，加强他们的政治时事学习和业务学习，不断提高他们的工作水平。要保证执行正确的干部政策，发扬民主，充分开展批评特别是自下而上的批评，提高全体党员干部和党外干部的积极性，注意党、团组织的整顿和提高工作。同时各级党委要建立必要的制度，保证对卫生工作进行经常的领导和检查，保证卫生部门的党组织严格执行党的原则、方针、政策和一切决议，坚决反对无组织无纪律状态。只要做好这些工作，卫生机构就会大大健全起来，坏分子就无空子可钻。这是杜绝违法乱纪事件的根本办法。
