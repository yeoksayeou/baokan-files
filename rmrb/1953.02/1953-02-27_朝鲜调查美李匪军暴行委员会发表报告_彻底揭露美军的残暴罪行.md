Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: TASS, Pyongyang, February 22nd: The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland held its 25th meeting. Present were the Presidium of the United Democratic Front, representatives of the Korean Workers' Party and various people's organizations, and members of the Committee for Investigating Atrocities of U.S. Armed Aggressors and the Syngman Rhee Clique.

The meeting adopted the letter from the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland to all Korean compatriots residing in Japan and approved the resolution of the Committee for Investigating Atrocities of U.S. Armed Aggressors and the Syngman Rhee Clique on investigating and determining the losses caused and crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: TASS, Pyongyang, February 24th: The Committee for Investigating Atrocities of U.S. Armed Aggressors and the Syngman Rhee Clique of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland has issued its fifth investigation report on the atrocities of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee forces.

The report begins by stating: The U.S. armed interventionists, in violation of all tenets of international law and trampling on the basic principles of human morality, have committed unprecedented atrocities on Korean soil. They have used cruelly murderous weapons, such as napalm bombs, bacteriological weapons, and chemical weapons, on a large scale to massacre the people. The aggressors have committed indescribable atrocities against captured officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Prisoner-of-war camps located on Koje Island, Pongam Island, Jeju Island, and in Busan have become torture chambers for tormenting and murdering prisoners. The U.S. aggressors invading Korea are expanding the scale of their heinous crimes every day. The report then details, in four chapters, various atrocities committed by the U.S. invading forces as confirmed after lengthy investigations.

The first chapter, titled "Destroying North Korean Cities and Villages and Massacring Civilians on a Large Scale," lists facts illustrating the crimes of the U.S. Air Force in systematically bombing peaceful residential areas in North Korea with no military targets. For example, U.S. aircraft systematically bombed various areas of South Hamgyong Province from January to March 1951, bombed and strafed various counties of Jagang Province from January 24th to 27th, 1952, and on October 15th, 1952, U.S. aircraft almost completely bombed the central areas of all counties and townships in North Hamgyong and South Hamgyong Provinces; at the same time, U.S. warships shelled the coastal areas of these two provinces.

The second chapter, titled "Using Weapons of Mass Slaughter," points out that the U.S. aggressors have been using bacteriological and chemical weapons on a large scale since 1951. From February 7th to April 9th, 1952, the U.S. interventionists used poison gas bombs 33 times. The U.S. aggressors also used bacteriological weapons countless times in various parts of northern Republic.

The third chapter, titled "Destroying Cultural and Public Institutions," cites numerous examples of the U.S. Air Force repeatedly bombing Korean cultural and public institutions, such as schools, hospitals, theaters, sanatoriums, and clubs.

The fourth chapter, titled "Destroying Korean Material Cultural Monuments," points out the crimes of the U.S. Air Force in indiscriminately bombing ancient temples, tombs, pavilions, and city gates, destroying Korean cultural relics.

The report concludes: The Investigation Committee makes public to the people of all countries the facts that have been investigated and confirmed and cited in this report, and is convinced that the freedom-loving people of all countries will agree that the organizers and executors of these malicious atrocities—the U.S. aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique—must bear full responsibility for these crimes and must be subjected to the most severe punishment. The criminals must be tried by a people's tribunal; this is the unanimous demand of the Korean people. We are confident that this just demand of the Korean people will receive the full support of all good men and women throughout the world.

    会议通过了祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会告侨居在日本的全体朝鲜同胞书，并批准了调查美国武装侵略者与李承晚匪帮暴行委员会关于调查和确定美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮所造成的损失和所犯的罪行的决议。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十四日讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查美国武装侵略者与李承晚匪帮暴行委员会发表了关于美、李军暴行的第五号调查报告。
    报告首先说：美国武装干涉者破坏国际法的一切准则，粗暴地蹂躏人类道德的基本原则，在朝鲜国土上犯了空前未有的暴行。他们大规模地使用凝固汽油弹、细菌武器和化学武器等大批屠杀人民的残忍武器。侵略者对被俘的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的官兵犯了难以形容的暴行。设在巨济岛、蜂岩岛、济州岛以及釜山等地的战俘营，已变成了折磨和谋杀战俘的刑房。进犯朝鲜的美国侵略者天天扩大他们穷凶极恶的犯罪规模。报告接着分作四章详述了经过长期调查后证实的美国侵略军的种种暴行。
    第一章题为：“破坏北朝鲜城乡、大批屠杀平民”，其中列举事实，说明美国空军有计划地轰炸毫无军事目标的北朝鲜和平居民区的罪行，例如美机在一九五一年一月到三月有计划地轰炸咸镜南道各地，一九五二年一月二十四日到二十七日轰炸和扫射慈江道各郡以及在一九五二年十月十五日美机几乎炸遍了咸镜北道和咸镜南道全部郡、面的中心；同时，美舰炮轰这两个道的沿海地带。
    第二章题为：“使用大规模屠杀的武器”，其中指出：美国侵略者从一九五一年以来，就在大规模使用细菌武器和化学武器。从一九五二年二月七日到四月九日，美国干涉者使用了三十三次毒气弹。美国侵略者并对共和国北部各地使用了无数次细菌武器。
    第三章题为：“破坏文化与公共机关”，其中举出许多事例，说明美国空军一再轰炸朝鲜文化、公共机关，如学校、医院、剧院、休养所、俱乐部等。
    第四章题为：“破坏朝鲜物质文化纪念物”，其中指出美国空军滥炸古代庙宇、陵墓、亭台、城门，破坏朝鲜文化遗物的罪行。
    报告最后说：调查委员会把调查证实了的和本报告所引用的事实公诸世界各国人民，并且确信世界各国爱好自由的人民一定同意：这些恶毒暴行的组织者和执行者——美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮，对于这些罪行应负完全责任并且应受最严厉的惩罚。罪犯必须受人民法庭的审判，这是朝鲜人民的一致要求。我们确信朝鲜人民的这个正当要求一定会得到全世界一切善良男女的全力支持。
