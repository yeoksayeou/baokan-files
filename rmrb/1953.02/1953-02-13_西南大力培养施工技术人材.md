Southwest China is vigorously training construction technical personnel. Various technical cadre training classes and technical worker training classes have been opened, and more than 300 construction workers (trained in phases) and more than 3,000 skilled workers will be trained in the short term. Most of the students participating in the study are unemployed workers, unemployed intellectuals, and construction workers.

The study time for each training class is determined according to the difficulty and practical needs of the various work courses. Riveters study for one year, while stonemasons and bricklayers study for one to three months. They must learn the basic knowledge of general construction industry and the operating methods of various types of work in a short period of time. Construction workers must understand the knowledge of mutual coordination of labor organizations of different types of work and learn to recognize construction drawings, the performance and use of materials, surveying, orientation, etc.

In order to solve the shortage of teachers, cadres, and funds, and to facilitate student internships, various training classes are scattered at various construction sites. Teachers are mostly engineers, technicians, and installation team leaders from the construction site. The Electrical Technology Training Class of the Southwest Electric Power Administration also has more than 50 technicians and technicians who have returned from studying in Northeast China to explain and guide.

Because the Southwest Industrial Administrations paid attention to cultivating the reserve force for construction, coupled with the existing construction personnel, the construction force in Southwest China this year can generally adapt to this year's construction tasks.

    西南大力培养施工技术人材
    西南区正在大力培养施工技术人材。现已开办各种技术干部训练班和技工训练班，将在短期内培养出三百个施工员（分期训练）和三千多个技术工人。参加学习的学员大部分为失业工人、失业知识分子、建筑工人等。
    各个训练班的学习时间按各个工种课程的难易和实际需要规定，铆工为一年，石工、泥工为一个月到三个月。他们必需在短期内学懂一般建筑工业的基本知识和各个工种的操作方法；施工员必须懂得不同工种劳动组织的互相配合的知识和学会认施工图样、材料性能用途、放线、方位等。
    为了解决师资、干部、经费等的不足和便于学员实习方便，各个训练班都分散在各个施工现场。教员多由工地工程师、技术员、安装队队长等担任，西南电业管理局的电业技术训练班并由从东北学习回来的五十多个技工、技术员讲解和指导。
    由于西南各工业管理局注意了培养施工的后备力量，加上现有的施工人材，西南今年的施工力量已大体上能适应今年的施工任务。（据新华社讯）
