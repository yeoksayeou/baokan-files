The Northwest Construction Engineering Company's 18th Engineering Team, during winter construction at the Xi'an Power Plant, impacted project quality and worker safety because the original captain, Wang Yaoliang, and others failed to adopt the suggestions of Soviet experts.

When constructing the factory building, Soviet expert Comrade Shabiro pointed out that the factory building's pillars should use No. 140 concrete (meaning concrete that can support 140 kilograms of weight per square centimeter), the slump of the concrete should be 5 centimeters, water should not be added when pouring the concrete, and the concrete should be rammed firmly with iron bars after pouring. This is because adding water to the concrete would reduce its strength, which is unfavorable for construction on loess layers (some loess layers become unstable when exposed to water); if the ramming is not done carefully, the quality of the concrete pillars cannot be guaranteed. However, the original captain of the engineering team, Wang Yaoliang, and others outwardly agreed but inwardly opposed, failing to adopt the Soviet experts' opinions. When pouring some pillars, in order to make the work easier and the pillar surface smooth and beautiful, they asked the workers to add a large amount of water during pouring, resulting in a reduction in the strength of the concrete. Some pillars and coal unloading ditches had honeycomb holes discovered after the formwork was removed because the concrete was rammed carelessly after pouring. In a pillar corbel in the boiler room, the rebar was tied crooked, the rebar was far from the formwork, and the anchor bolts could not be inserted between the rebars. The Soviet expert pointed out that another section of rebar should be added, but Wang Yaoliang just casually threw a few rebars in, which did not play the role it should have. The Soviet expert pointed out that small holes should be left when pouring concrete to insert thermometers to grasp the temperature changes of the concrete, so as to correctly determine the time to remove the formwork. They did not leave any small holes, making it difficult to determine the time to remove the formwork.

Soviet expert Comrade Shabiro was very concerned about the safety and health of the workers and put forward many suggestions to improve safety and welfare conditions. In order to prevent workers from being in danger when working at high altitudes, the Soviet expert personally helped complete the design of the catwalk scaffolding. However, Wang Yaoliang, as the responsible cadre of the engineering team, did not follow the original design of using double-pole wooden frames when making the catwalk scaffolding, but only used single-pole wooden frames; the original design required the joints of the wooden poles to be tied with lead wire and threaded with needles, but they only tied them with hemp rope; the original design required the scaffolding to have horizontal and vertical supports, but they only added vertical supports. The hoist frame for hoisting cement was very weak, and the workers had raised opinions for improvement, but they ignored them, resulting in the overturn of the hoist twice, injuring three workers.

    西北建筑工程公司第十八工程队原队长王尧梁等不采纳苏联专家建议影响了工程质量
    西北建筑工程公司第十八工程队，在西安电厂进行冬季施工时，因原队长王尧梁等不采纳苏联专家的建议，使工程质量和工人安全受到影响。
    建筑厂房时，苏联专家沙比洛同志曾指出厂房柱子要用一四○号混凝土（即每一平方公分可以支持一百四十公斤重量的混凝土），混凝土的塌落度应为五公分，灌浇混凝土时不要加水，灌浇后要用铁钎子捣结实。因为如果在混凝土中加了水，便会降低混凝土的强度，对于在黄土层上施工不利（有些黄土层见水便不坚固了）；如捣得不仔细，便不能保证混凝土柱子的质量。可是工程队原队长王尧梁等阳奉阴违，不采纳苏联专家的意见。灌浇某些柱子时，为贪图工作时方便和柱子表面光滑漂亮，便要工人在灌浇时大量加水，结果降低了混凝土的强度。有些柱子和卸煤沟，因灌浇混凝土后捣得马虎，拆掉模板后便发现了蜂窝洞。锅炉间一个柱子牛腿中的钢筋扎歪了，钢筋离模板很远，底脚螺丝不能插在钢筋之间。苏联专家指出要加扎一段钢筋，但王尧梁却只是随随便便地丢了几根钢筋进去，因而没有起到应有的作用。苏联专家指出，在灌混凝土时，要留出插温度计的小孔，以便掌握混凝土温度变化的情况，便于正确决定拆模板的时间。他们却都没有留小孔，以致拆模板的时间很难确定。
    苏联专家沙比洛同志对工人的安全和身体健康十分关心，曾提出不少改进安全福利状况的意见。为了使工人在高空作业时不发生危险，苏联专家亲自帮助完成了走台架子的设计。但身为工程队负责干部的王尧梁，在做走台架子时，却不按原设计用双杆木架做，只用单杆木架；原设计木杆子的接头处要用铅丝绑起来，用穿针穿上，但他们却只用麻绳绑上；原设计架子要有横撑、竖撑，但他们只加竖撑。吊洋灰的吊斗架子很不结实，工人曾提出改进的意见，但他们不理睬，结果翻了两次吊斗，伤了三个工人。
