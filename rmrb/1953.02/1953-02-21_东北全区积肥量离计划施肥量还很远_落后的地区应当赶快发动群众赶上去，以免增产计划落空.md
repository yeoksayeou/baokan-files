    The amount of manure accumulated in the entire Northeast region is still far from the planned amount of fertilizer application.
    Backward areas should quickly mobilize the masses to catch up, lest the production increase plan falls through.
    The Northeast Regional Fertilizer Work Conference held last year determined that the amount of fertilizer applied in 1953 should be increased by half compared to 1952. However, according to recent surveys in various parts of Northeast China, the entire region has only completed 75% to 80% of this plan for manure accumulation. The Northeast Regional Agricultural Production Conference determined that this year, the area of high-yield land will be expanded by 2 million to 3 million hectares, which requires more fertilizer. Therefore, further development of the winter manure accumulation campaign has become an urgent task for the Northeast region. According to the inspection by the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, many areas have not carried out the manure accumulation campaign well since the beginning of winter; if we do not seize the opportunity to further work hard to remedy this, the plan to increase the amount of fertilizer applied and the production increase plan will fall through.
    The manure accumulation campaign is being carried out relatively well in most parts of Northeast China. Many areas have promoted the winter manure accumulation campaign by popularizing the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan. After Acheng County, Songjiang Province, publicized Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, it set off a county-wide upsurge in manure accumulation. According to statistics on January 13 this year, the accumulated fertilizer is enough for 95% of the cultivated land, completing the plan to fertilize all 130,000 hectares of land in the county this year, and there is confidence in applying 35 to 60 carts of fertilizer per hectare on nearly 30,000 hectares of high-yield land. In order to ensure that all the manure is applied to the fields, the method of accumulating and delivering manure at the same time has also been widely adopted. In the process of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, the Second District of Shuangcheng County also launched a district-wide manure accumulation campaign, building 882 toilets, 763 ash storage sheds, and 129 new pigsties in winter alone.
    However, in many areas, the winter manure accumulation campaign has not yet been universally launched. Huachuan County made a resolution on winter manure accumulation at the county people's congress on November 3 last year. However, due to a lack of inspection and supervision, one month later, the winter production campaign had not yet been launched in four-fifths of the villages. In Longsheng Village, Huachuan County, for example, the manure accumulated is only equivalent to 17% of the fertilization plan. Some farmers believe that "the Great Northern Wilderness has fertile soil, and you can harvest grain even without applying fertilizer." They would rather be idle than accumulate manure. There are also some cadres and farmers in some areas who are only interested in engaging in sideline occupations and have abandoned the manure accumulation plan. For example, Wang Huanjin's joint group in Renjing Village, a suburb of Shenyang City, is still short of 40% of manure so far, but none of the group members are accumulating manure, and they are all engaged in sideline occupations.
    The spring plowing season is very near, and leading organs at all levels should immediately conduct in-depth inspections and promote further mobilization of the masses to carry out the manure accumulation campaign. It is necessary to persuade farmers to make full use of existing manure sources, enclose livestock, collect small amounts of ash separately, and organize women and semi-laborers to pick up manure. At the same time, attention should be paid to delivering manure earlier. According to calculations in Fulicun Village, Shuangcheng County: the village has 1,020 hectares of land, and 27,000 carts of fertilizer will be applied this year. In addition to the vehicles engaged in sideline occupations and transporting and purchasing grain, there are only 40 vehicles that can deliver manure. Each vehicle delivers eight carts of manure per day, rain or shine, and it will take until mid-March to complete the delivery, which is close to the time of sowing wheat; a slight delay will risk not being able to deliver it. In addition, attention should also be paid to making the yellow manure fully fermented. The yellow manure accumulated in the winter in rural Northeast China accounts for more than half of the yellow manure accumulated throughout the year; however, according to inspections in five counties including Huachuan, the yellow manure accumulated in winter has not been fermented. Therefore, it is necessary to persuade farmers to seize the time to use boiling water to ferment the yellow manure or to bury cooked "shriveled grains" in the manure pile to make the yellow manure ferment.

### 东北全区积肥量离计划施肥量还很远  落后的地区应当赶快发动群众赶上去，以免增产计划落空

    东北全区积肥量离计划施肥量还很远
    落后的地区应当赶快发动群众赶上去，以免增产计划落空
    东北区去年召开的肥料工作会议，曾确定一九五三年度的施肥量要比一九五二年提高半倍。但据东北各地最近调查，全区积肥工作只完成这个计划的百分之七十五到八十。东北区农业生产会议确定，今年要扩大丰产地二百万到三百万垧，这就需要更多的肥料。因此，进一步开展冬季积肥运动已成为东北区当前的迫切任务。根据东北行政委员会农业局检查，不少地区入冬以来并没有很好地开展积肥运动；如果不抓紧时机进一步努力加以补救，提高施肥量的计划和增产计划就会落空。
    东北大部地区积肥运动开展得比较好。许多地区通过推广肇源的丰产经验，推动了冬季积肥运动。松江省阿城县宣传了肇源丰产经验，就掀起了全县的积肥热潮，到今年一月十三日统计，所积肥料够上百分之九十五的耕地，完成今年全县十三万垧土地全部施肥，在将近三万垧丰产地上每垧施肥三十五到六十车的计划已有了把握。为了使所有的粪都上到地里，还普遍采取了边攒边送的办法。双城县二区在推广肇源丰产经验的过程中，也开展了全区的积肥运动，光冬季就修厕所八百八十二个、灰仓七百六十三个，新建猪圈一百二十九个。
    但是，不少地区的冬季积肥运动至今没有普遍展开。桦川县去年十一月三日在县人民代表会上，对冬季积肥做了决议。但由于缺乏检查督促，在一个月之后，五分之四的村子的冬季生产运动还没有展开。像桦川县的龙胜屯，所攒的粪只相当施肥计划的百分之十七。有的农民认为“北大荒，地板壮，不上粪，也打粮”。宁愿闲着，也不去积肥。还有一些地区的干部和农民，光顾搞副业，而放弃了积肥计划。如沈阳市郊仁境村王焕金联组，到目前为止尚缺粪百分之四十，但全组组员没有一个人攒粪，都搞副业去了。
    春耕时期已经很近了，各级领导机关应当立即深入检查推动，进一步发动群众开展积肥运动。要说服农民充分利用现有粪源，把牲口圈起来，把小灰单另攒起来，并组织妇女和半劳动力捡粪。同时要注意早些送粪。据双城县富礼村计算：全村一千零二十垧地，今年要施肥二万七千车。除搞副业和运粮购粮的车以外，只有四十台车可以送粪。每车每天送粪八车，风雨不误地送，需要到三月中旬才能送完，已接近播种小麦时期；稍一耽误，就有送不出的危险。此外还应注意使黄粪充分发酵。东北农村冬季所积的黄粪要占全年所积黄粪的半数以上；但据桦川等五县检查，冬季所积黄粪都没有发酵。因此，要说服农民抓紧时间采用开水发黄粪或把“谷瘪子”煮熟埋在粪堆里的办法使黄粪发酵。
