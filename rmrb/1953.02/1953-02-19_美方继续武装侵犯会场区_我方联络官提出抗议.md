    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 18th: US-controlled armed personnel entered the Korean armistice negotiation conference area on February 10th and set fire to a civilian house; they also entered the conference area on February 12th and opened fire on our military police, wounding one of our military police. Following these two serious violations of the agreement, a US military aircraft violated the agreement by intruding into the airspace over the conference area at approximately 17:20 on February 16th. At the liaison officers' meeting on February 18th, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side regarding this incident and demanded that the other side take concrete and effective measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. At this meeting, our side also urged the other side to promptly provide an explanation for the two serious violations of the agreement on February 10th and February 12th, but the other side continued to adopt delaying tactics, claiming that they were conducting an investigation.

    美方继续武装侵犯会场区
    我方联络官提出抗议
    【新华社开城十八日电】　美方控制下的武装人员在二月十日进入朝鲜停战谈判会场区，纵火焚烧民房一所；又在二月十二日进入会场区，开枪射击我方军事警察，击伤我方军事警察一名。在这两次严重违反协议的事件之后，美方军用飞机一架又在二月十六日十七时二十分左右，违反协议，侵入会场区上空。在二月十八日的双方联络官会议上，我方首席联络官就这一事件向对方提出抗议，并要求对方采取确实有效的措施，使类似事件不再发生。在这次会议上，我方并催促对方迅速对二月十日和二月十二日两次严重违反协议的事件提出交代，但对方继续采取拖延态度，声称正在从事调查。
