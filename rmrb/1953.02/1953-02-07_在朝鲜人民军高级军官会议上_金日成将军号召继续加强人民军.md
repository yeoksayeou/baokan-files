Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th: On the eve of the "February 8th" anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, "Labor News" and "Democratic Korea" published on the 4th a report by General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, entitled "Strengthen the People's Army" at a meeting of senior officers of the Korean People's Army on December 24, 1952. In his report, General Kim Il-sung explained the growth and strengthening of the Korean People's Army and put forward various tasks for further strengthening the People's Army in 1953.

Kim Il-sung said in his report: The Korean people's war against the American and British armed aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang for the liberation of the fatherland has continued into its third year. Because the American imperialists are unwilling to accept fair and reasonable armistice terms, we are facing a new stage in the war.

Kim Il-sung then said: The Korean people's war for the independence and freedom of the fatherland, with the warm support of progressive mankind around the world, has achieved great victories and laid the foundation for achieving final victory. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, united by internationalist friendship and fighting side by side, have grown into powerful military forces capable of crushing the enemy's aggression in the war against the common enemy, the American aggressor. The young Korean People's Army has also become a new type of army and an invincible army.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: In the course of three years of fierce war, the profound understanding of the justice and purpose of the war by every commander and fighter of the People's Army, and the understanding of the blood relationship between the purpose of the war and the interests of the people, have had a great significance in improving the moral character of the People's Army. The political work of the Labor Party in the army has played a great role in ensuring the victory of the war. The heroic example of the Labor Party members in battle has further guaranteed the indomitable tenacity of the People's Army.

Kim Il-sung then explained the specific situation of the People's Army's growth in quantity and equipment. He said: During the Fatherland Liberation War, the number of the People's Army has tripled. Due to the increase in cannons, mortars, machine guns, automatic rifles and other weapons, by 1952, the firepower of each infantry division had increased to 160 percent of that in 1951. From 1951 to 1952, the number of submachine guns in our army increased to 144 percent, machine guns to 124 percent, cannons to 128 percent, mortars to 140 percent, anti-aircraft guns to 218 percent, tanks and self-propelled guns to 182 percent, and the automatic rifle firepower of the infantry increased to 141 percent. The various arms and services have sufficient military supplies to carry out protracted warfare. The degree of mechanization of our army has also been improved. In 1952, the average horsepower per soldier increased to three times that of 1951.

Kim Il-sung said: During the war, our commanders have also been strengthened correspondingly in quality and quantity. In 1952, 45 percent of the commanders received re-education and were re-armed with theoretical knowledge and combat experience, and could command the battle well. The General Staff has also learned to command the army and has become a true assistant to the commander. At the same time, the various arms and services have strengthened and well-organized rear areas, which can ensure the timely supply of the military supplies needed by the army.

Kim Il-sung then put forward various tasks for continuing to strengthen the People's Army in 1953. He said: In 1953, we must continue to strengthen our vigilance against the American and British aggressors, and continue to strengthen our preparations for long-term war and large-scale war. We must further strengthen the political work of the Labor Party in the People's Army, consolidate the organizational discipline of the troops, must organize more combat training for the various arms and services, strengthen the coordination of the various arms and services in combat, must further improve the firing accuracy of the anti-aircraft gun troops, and must firmly and tenaciously defend our land and coastal fronts. If the enemy launches a frenzied offensive or carries out amphibious landing operations, we must not let the enemy advance or land. We must not only repel them, but also fatally strike them, and eliminate more of the enemy's manpower and military equipment. Kim Il-sung concluded: Our people have high hopes for our army and are convinced of our victory.

    在朝鲜人民军高级军官会议上
    金日成将军号召继续加强人民军
    【新华社平壤六日电】在“二·八”朝鲜人民军建军节就要到来的时候，“劳动新闻”、“民主朝鲜”报四日发表了朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军在一九五二年十二月二十四日举行的朝鲜人民军高级军官会议上所作的题为“要加强人民军队”的报告。金日成将军在报告中说明了朝鲜人民军成长壮大的情况，并提出了一九五三年进一步加强人民军的各项任务。
    金日成在报告中说：朝鲜人民反对美英武装侵略者和李承晚匪帮的祖国解放战争，已经继续到第三年。由于美帝国主义者不愿意接受公平合理的停战条件，我们正面临着战争的新的阶段。
    金日成接着说：朝鲜人民争取祖国独立和自由的战争，在全世界进步人类的热烈支持下，已经取得巨大胜利，打下了取得最后胜利的基础。以国际主义的友谊关系团结起来并肩作战的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在反对共同敌人美国侵略者的战争中，已经成长壮大为足以粉碎敌人侵略势力的强大军事力量。年轻的朝鲜人民军也已经成为新型的军队和必胜不败的军队。
    金日成指出：在三年的激烈的战争过程中，人民军每个指挥员和战斗员对战争正义性和战争目的的深刻认识，对战争目的与人民利益之间的血缘关系的理解，对于提高人民军的道德品质有着巨大的意义。劳动党在军队中的政治工作，对于保证战争胜利起了巨大作用。劳动党员在战斗中的英勇榜样，更加保证了人民军百折不挠的顽强性。
    金日成接着说明人民军在数量上和装备上壮大的具体情况。他说：在祖国解放战争期间，人民军在数量上已经增加了三倍。由于增加了大炮、迫击炮、机关枪、自动枪和其他武器，到一九五二年，各个步兵师团的火力，已经增加到一九五一年的百分之一百六十。从一九五一年到一九五二年的期间，我们军队的冲锋枪增加到百分之一百四十四、机枪增加到百分之一二四、大炮增加到百分之一二八、迫击炮增加到百分之一四零、高射炮增加到百分之二一八、坦克和自动炮增加到百分之一八二、步兵的自动枪火力增加到百分之一四一。各兵种部队已经拥有可以进行持久战的充分的军需器材。我们军队机械化的程度也提高了，一九五二年，每个士兵的平均马力已经增加到一九五一年的三倍。
    金日成说：在战争期间，我们指挥官在质量上和数量上也相应地加强了。一九五二年，有百分之四十五的指挥官受到了再教育，用理论知识和战斗经验重新武装起来，可以很好地指挥战斗。参谋部也已经学会了指挥军队，成为指挥官的真正助手。同时，各兵种部队都有着加强了的组织好了的后方，可以保证及时供应军队所需要的军需品。
    金日成接着提出在一九五三年继续加强人民军的各项任务。他说：在一九五三年，我们必须继续加强对美英侵略者的警惕性，继续加强对长期战争和大规模战争的准备。我们必须进一步加强劳动党在人民军中的政治工作，巩固部队的组织性纪律性，必须更多的组织各兵种的战斗训练，加强各兵种在作战中的协同，必须进一步提高高射炮部队的火力命中率，必须牢固地顽强地防卫我们陆上和海岸的战线。如果敌人发动疯狂进攻或肆行登陆作战，必须不让敌人前进，不让敌人登陆。不仅要击退他们，而且要致命地打击他们，更大量的消灭敌人的有生力量和军事装备。金日成最后说：我国人民对我们军队抱着很高的希望，并且确信着我们的胜利。
