    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. The mass anti-espionage struggle launched by people from all walks of life in Korea is powerfully crushing the plot of the American-Syngman Rhee clique to send spies to infiltrate North Korea to carry out criminal activities. According to incomplete statistics, more than 200 American-Syngman Rhee clique spies of various kinds were captured in various parts of North Korea in the second half of last year. More than 80 percent of them were armed spies, most of whom were airdropped by American planes, and a small number infiltrated from the sea.
    In the anti-espionage struggle, the people and People's Self-Defense Forces in various parts of North Korea have displayed a spirit of selfless courage and a high degree of wisdom, and have therefore achieved great results. Self-defense team members in Zhongshan Village, Damei Township, Sinxi County, Hwanghae Province, discovered one dark night in October last year that an American bomber was circling overhead for a long time. They immediately summoned all the villagers to set up sentry posts on the mountainside and persisted until dawn, finally capturing ten armed spies who had been airdropped. On the evening of December 2, teacher Park Tae-soo and five others, along with five students from a certain school, saw white parachutes falling from the sky after enemy planes strafed them. They climbed over two mountains in one breath, using stones as hand grenades, and bravely captured two airdropped spies who resisted with gunfire. Kim Jong-soo, the captain of the People's Self-Defense Force in a certain village on the coastline of Tieshan County, North Pyongan Province, went up the mountain to collect firewood one day and found nine suspicious people on the mountain whispering about some ship issues. They disappeared after a while. That night, Kim Jong-soo borrowed a wooden boat and placed it on the seashore, and he and his team members ambushed it in the surrounding area. On the third night, the nine people hurriedly came down from the mountain and ran towards the wooden boat. At this moment, this group of airdropped spies who attempted to return to South Korea were suddenly attacked by the self-defense team. Caught off guard, they were all captured. After farmer Kim Ok-soon from Nanyanbaek County in the newly liberated area discovered eight spies impersonating Korean People's Army soldiers, she cleverly settled them in her own home and then reported to the government, arresting them all. Young Yingzi from Datong County, South Pyongan Province, discovered a suspicious person in a ravine outside the village and immediately asked her sister to report to the self-defense team, resulting in the capture of six spies in a cave in the ravine.
    At the same time, many moving examples of family members exposing and arresting spies have emerged in various places.
    In the mass anti-espionage struggle, a large number of heroic and resourceful model figures have emerged in various parts of North Korea. They have all been commended by the government. By the end of last year, in Hwanghae Province alone, 25 members of the People's Self-Defense Force had been awarded the National Flag Medal for their meritorious service in anti-espionage and bandit suppression, and 700 had been awarded the Military Service Medal.

    朝鲜各界人民展开群众性反特务斗争
    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜各界人民展开的群众性反特务斗争，正在有力地粉碎着美李匪帮派遣特务潜入朝鲜北部进行罪恶活动的阴谋。据不完全统计，朝鲜北部各地在去年下半年捕获的美李匪帮各种特务有二百多人。其中百分之八十以上是武装特务，大多数特务是美机空投下来的，小部分从海上潜入。
    朝鲜北部各地人民和人民自卫队在反特务斗争中发挥了奋不顾身的精神和高度的智慧，因而获得了很大成绩。黄海道新溪郡多美面中山里的自卫队员在去年十月的一天深夜，发现美国轰炸机在上空低飞盘旋很久，便立即召集全村居民在山边布哨，坚持到天亮，终于捉住了空降的十个武装特务。十二月二日晚上，某学校的教员朴泰洙等六人和学生五人在敌机扫射一阵之后，看见空中飘下白色的降落伞，就一口气爬过两个山头，用石块当手榴弹，英勇地捉住了两个打枪抵抗的空降特务。平安北道铁山郡在海岸线上的某里的人民自卫队队长金正洙有一天上山打柴，发现山上有九个可疑的人在低声议论着什么船只的问题，过一会儿便不见了。当天晚上，金正洙借了一条木船放在海边，自己和队员们埋伏在周围一带加以监视。到第三天夜间，那九个人从山上匆匆下来向木船奔去。正在这时，这批企图回南朝鲜的空降特务遭到了自卫队的突然袭击，因措手不及便全部落网了。新解放区南延白郡农民金玉顺发现冒充朝鲜人民军的八个特务以后，机智地把他们安顿在自己家中，然后报告政府，把他们全部逮捕。平安南道大同郡的小女孩英子发现村外山沟里有一个行迹可疑的人，立即叫她姊姊报告自卫队，结果在山沟里的一个山洞里抓住了六个特务。
    同时，各地并出现了不少家属检举和逮捕做特务的动人事例。
    在群众性的反特务斗争中，朝鲜北部各地都涌现了大批英勇机智的模范人物。他们都受到了政府的表扬。到去年年底为止，仅黄海道一地的人民自卫队员就有二十五人因反特务和剿匪有功而荣获国旗勋章，有七百人荣获军功章。
