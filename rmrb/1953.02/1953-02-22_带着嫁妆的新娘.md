A society gossip column in a British newspaper reported an upcoming major event: the Duke of Douglas-Hamilton was to marry Miss Bean, an American heiress. This union, perhaps based on love, clearly had diplomatic intentions.

The Duke of Douglas-Hamilton is famous for being one of the drafters of the plan to encourage American investment in Scotland. His economic program is in line with current policy. His marriage is a marriage of American and British enterprises. The groom's investment in this venture is his own illustrious reputation, while the bride's investment is – capital and dollars. The wedding will proceed entirely according to the rituals of the Church of England and the terms of the American Marshall Plan.

But the American bride is bringing more than just dollars as a dowry from across the ocean; her dowry also includes: a fascist organization planned for Britain to "oppose communism," called "Common Cause." Its branches have so far been established in Italy, France, West Germany, and the Netherlands. But there are no branches in Britain. How could this be? But now this oversight can be remedied: Miss Bean brought the branch as a gift for her fiancé.

The "Reynolds News" wrote: "Miss Bean is the boss of the militant anti-communist 'Common Cause' organization, which in the United States is dedicated to persecuting progressive people. Bean's visit to Britain this time is to establish the same organization with the help of Conservative members of Parliament and the Duke of Douglas-Hamilton, and only then is she prepared to marry." We can see that fascism is exported from the United States in such a variety of ways: even Hymen, the ancient protector of matchmakers and marriage (the Greek god of marriage – editor's note), is being used as a special agent by American reactionaries!

American millionaires buying British dukes and gentlemen – this is not a newly opened department of Anglo-American commodity circulation. We must not describe this extremely reactionary political activity of American tycoons in Britain as real news. The future Mrs. Hamilton is following in the footsteps of Mrs. Astor.

Mrs. Astor, the heiress to the vast fortune of a famous American tycoon, purchased the ancient Cliveden Castle, which came with extensive gardens, large tracts of land, service facilities, stables, and a husband. Mrs. Astor was also keen on politics and extremely conservative. As a result, Cliveden Castle became a political drawing room, and Mrs. Astor's regulars, political followers, and allies were given the nickname the Cliveden Set. Extremely barbaric and adventurous aggressive plans were drawn up in the castle's drawing room. Before the Second World War, it became a den of Hitler's lackeys, and during the war, some of the Cliveden Set's regulars were exposed as traitors and betrayers of their country.

The Cliveden Set was discredited. Mrs. Astor had to stop her activities. She herself is already in her twilight years. But Miss Bean, as the embodiment of the youth of American imperialism, is closely following in her footsteps. Mrs. Astor relied on British reactionaries to build her group. But the future Mrs. Hamilton, Miss Bean, brought a ready-made American-fascist organization in person. Her aggressive arrogance is even higher; even before she set foot on British soil, she felt like she was in complete control. It turns out she didn't come alone. With her are those modern invaders who have come from overseas, the Kaiser Wilhelm of the American air bases in Britain, the officers of the American garrison, and the agents of American monopoly capital.

Fascism is a cause that the Hamilton family has often served. Hess, who flew to Britain in 1941 and parachuted down to prepare for peace talks with Britain, was received by the Duke's brother. At that time, fascism was imported from Germany to Britain. But now it is imported from the United States. We can confidently predict that, at the same time, it will increase anti-American sentiment to a greater extent. Ordinary Britons hate American airfields, American garrisons, and American rogues. Towards these hateful Americans, the common people have a common formula: Yankee, go home!

    带着嫁妆的新娘
    苏联　杰米道夫
    英国报纸的交际花絮栏登载了一则行将到来的重大事件：陶格拉斯—哈米尔顿公爵将娶美国富豪小姐蓓恩为妻。这种结合，也许是以爱情为基础的，但是很显然，这有外交上的打算。
    陶格拉斯—哈米尔顿公爵之所以著名，是因为他是制定鼓励美国投资苏格兰的计划草拟人之一。他的经济纲领是和现行的政策相吻合的。他的结婚是美英企业的结婚。新郎对这个事业的投资是他本人显赫的声名，新娘的投资是——资本和美元。婚礼的进行将完全按照英国教堂的仪式和美国马歇尔计划的条款。
    但是美国新娘从大洋彼岸带来的嫁妆不止是美元而已；她的嫁妆中还带来了：替英国筹划好了的“反对共产主义的”法西斯组织，名称叫做“共同事业”。它的分支机构到现在为止已在意大利、法国、西德和荷兰建立起来了。可是在英国却没有分支机构。这怎么行，但现在这个疏忽可以弥补了：蓓恩小姐把分支机构作为给未婚夫的礼物带来了。
    “雷诺新闻”写道：“蓓恩小姐是好战的反共的‘共同事业’组织的老板娘，在美国是专门致力于迫害进步人士的。蓓恩这次到英国，是想藉助国会保守党议员、陶格拉斯—哈米尔顿公爵之力建立同样的组织，如此她才准备出嫁的。”我们可以看见，法西斯主义从美国输出是如此多种多样：甚至连古时的保护媒人和媒婆的希缪米神（希腊神话中专司婚姻之神——编者注），也被用来充当美国反动派的特务了！
    美国的千金小姐收买英国的公爵和绅士——这不是英美商品流通的新辟的一个部门。决不能把美国富豪在英国的这种绝顶反动的政治活动说成是真正的新闻。未来的哈米尔顿夫人是效法阿斯脱夫人的。
    美国著名财阀百万家产的继承者阿斯脱夫人，曾购置了古老的克兰夫琴城堡，这个城堡附有广阔的花园、大片的土地和服务设备，附有马厩以及丈夫。阿斯脱夫人同样热心政治，并且极端保守。因而克兰夫琴城堡成了政治社交厅，而阿斯脱夫人的常客、政治信徒和同盟者，便得到了克兰夫琴集团的绰号。在城堡的客厅里制订了极端野蛮的、冒险的侵略计划。第二次世界大战前，这里就成为希特勒的走狗的窠穴，在战争期间，克兰夫琴集团的一些常客被作为卖国贼和叛徒而揭露出来了。
    克兰夫琴集团是身败名裂了。阿斯脱夫人不得不停止了她的活动。她本人也已入垂暮之年了。但作为美帝国主义青年的化身的蓓恩小姐却紧跟着她的后尘。阿斯脱夫人是依靠英国的反动人物建立她的集团的。而未来的哈米尔顿夫人、蓓恩小姐却亲身带来了现成的美国—法西斯组织。她的侵略气焰更高，甚至在未降临英国土地之前，她就觉得自己是全权主人。原来她不是孤零零来的。和她在一起的有那些从海外来到的当代的侵略者德皇威廉——美国在不列颠的空军基地的建造人、美国驻军的官长们和美国垄断资本的代理人。
    法西斯主义是哈米尔顿家族经常为之服务的事业。一九四一年飞到英国用降落伞跳下来准备与英国议和的赫斯，就是由这位公爵的兄长接待的。想当时法西斯主义是从德国输入英国的。但现在它从美国输入了。我们可以肯定地预言，与此同时，它将在更大的程度上助长反美的情绪。普通的英国人讨厌美国的飞机场、美国的驻军和美国的无赖之徒。对待这些讨厌的美国人，老百姓有一条通用的公式：美国佬，滚回去！
