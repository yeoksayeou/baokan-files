Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    The People's Government of Suiping County wrote: In the "Readers' Letters" page of the People's Daily on September 3, 1952, the letter of criticism from comrades Jian Hua and Luo Ge regarding the "many documents, many forms, and many meetings" in our county is completely true. The reasons for this situation were: on the one hand, there was a lot of work in our county at that time; on the other hand, the leadership of our county did not coordinate the work arrangements, and various departments were grasping things randomly. Now our county has initially corrected this situation. The Party, government, and mass organizations strive to unify their pace in arranging current central and major tasks. Unnecessary meetings are not held; necessary meetings are thoroughly prepared in advance. In addition to the main documents issued, the "Suiping Newsletter" and "Briefing" methods are generally used to issue information. The county people's government has equipped specialized statistics personnel to grasp the figures of various grassroots units and uniformly arrange report forms; any unit that issues report forms without approval, each district and township can refuse to fill them out.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    遂平县人民政府已初步纠正乡村干部工作忙乱的情况
    遂平县人民政府来信：一九五二年九月三日人民日报“读者来信专页”中，发表了建华、洛葛两同志对我县“公文多、表格多、会议多”的批评信，完全属实。造成这种情况的原因：一方面是当时我县工作甚多；另一方面是我县领导方面布置工作不统一，各部门乱抓。现在我县已初步纠正这种情况。党、政及群众团体对当前中心和主要工作的布置力求统一步调。不必要的会不开；必要的会事先要充分准备。除主要下达文件外，一般用“遂平简讯”和“简报”方式下达。县人民政府配备了专门统计人员，掌握各基层数字，统一布置表报；任何单位不经批示发报表，各区乡可拒绝填报。
