Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 10th: On February 7th, on the eve of the founding of the Korean People's Army, the U.S. side once again cruelly used poison gas to barbarously attack captured Korean People's Army personnel who were singing in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Two days prior to this, the U.S. side had shot and killed a prisoner of war for no reason.

According to the U.S. side, on February 7th, our captured personnel on Geoje Island valiantly sang songs of their homeland. The American troops, who were prepared for this, purposefully used force to confine the unyielding prisoners of war singing in their barracks, and then attacked them with poison gas. U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Cadwell openly stated that the use of poison gas was "effective" and said that "necessary force" would continue to be used against the prisoners of war, while the official U.S. communique lied, saying that "no one was injured" among the prisoners of war. As everyone knows, prisoners of war are constantly being killed and injured in large numbers by the U.S. side for singing. On October 1st last year, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Jeju Island were attacked for singing to commemorate the National Day of their homeland, resulting in 165 deaths and injuries. On August 15th the year before last, Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Busan and Geoje Island were also attacked for singing to commemorate the homeland's "Liberation Day." In the 64th, 65th, and 84th compounds alone, more than 120 people were killed and injured.

Since the Beehive Island massacre that shocked the world, the U.S. side has even more tightly blockaded news of the massacre in the prisoner-of-war camp. However, in the first week of February alone, according to figures reluctantly revealed by the U.S. side, there were as many as four incidents of persecuting and massacring prisoners of war. These incidents of persecution and massacre more clearly prove that Clark's so-called "intelligence report" slandering our negotiating representatives is a complete fabrication. The real purpose of this report is to completely destroy the possibility of resuming negotiations on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, and to further drag the United States' satellite states into the quagmire of the expanded war of aggression that the U.S. side is planning.

### 美方又用毒气野蛮攻击朝人民军被俘人员

    美方又用毒气野蛮攻击朝人民军被俘人员
    【新华社开城十日电】二月七日，朝鲜人民军建军节前夕，美方又在巨济岛战俘营内残酷地用毒气野蛮攻击唱歌的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。在这之前两天，美方曾无故枪杀战俘一名。
    据美方透露：二月七日，巨济岛上的我方被俘人员英勇地高唱祖国的歌曲，早有准备的美军就有计划地用武力把高歌不屈的战俘压迫在营房内，然后用毒气进行攻击。美方战俘营长官卡德维尔公开声称：施用毒气“有效”，并说将对战俘继续施用“必要的武力”，而美方官方公报却撒谎说战俘 “无人受伤”。大家知道，战俘不断地因为唱歌而被美方大批打死打伤。去年十月一日，济州岛上的中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为唱歌纪念祖国国庆，被打死打伤一百六十五名。前年八月十五日，釜山和巨济岛上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员同样因为唱歌纪念祖国“解放日”，仅在第六十四、六十五、八十四等营场内，就被打死打伤一百二十多名。
    自从震惊全世界的蜂岩岛大屠杀发生以来，美方就更严密地把战俘营内屠杀事件的消息封锁起来。但是在二月份的第一周内，仅据美方被迫透露的数字，迫害屠杀战俘竟达四次之多。这些迫害屠杀事件更清楚地证明：克拉克不久以前所发表的诬蔑我方谈判代表的所谓“情报报告”是彻头彻尾的捏造。这个报告的真正目的，就是要在联合国大会前夕，彻底破坏恢复谈判的可能性，更进一步把美国的仆从国家拖入美方正在策划扩大的侵略战争的泥淖中去。
