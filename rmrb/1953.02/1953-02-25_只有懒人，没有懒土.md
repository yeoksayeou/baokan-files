    “There is no lazy soil, only lazy people”
    The lesson of declining cotton production in the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area in recent years deserves the close attention of all agricultural work cadres across the country.
    For several years, the agricultural and water conservancy leading organizations in the Northwest Region and Shaanxi Province have failed to find the real reason for the yearly decline in cotton production in the irrigation area. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government sent people to investigate in 1951, but they only saw some superficial phenomena and did not propose specific improvement suggestions. Therefore, they were unable to stop the trend of declining cotton production in the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area early on, causing huge losses to the country and local people. This is partly because they lacked the spirit of going deep into reality and deep among the masses, and partly because they did not seriously study science and technology and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This time, the investigation team organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central Government went deep into reality, deep among the masses, and conducted detailed and thorough investigations. With the help of Soviet experts, they conducted scientific research and analysis, and finally clarified the fundamental reason for the decline in cotton production in the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area. If they had done this earlier, and studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union seriously rather than perfunctorily, they would have increased a huge amount of wealth for the country and the people.
    This incident more clearly proves that: "There is no lazy soil, only lazy people." Lack of scientific and technological knowledge and specific leadership can turn good land into bad land, and the root cause cannot be found for several years. This is a painful lesson. In the future, agricultural leading cadres in various regions and leading cadres in various counties should diligently study science and technology, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; strive to truly become experts in leading agricultural production as soon as possible, and strengthen specific leadership, doing a careful and thorough job of propaganda and organizational work, so that improving agricultural technology truly becomes the demand of the masses themselves and becomes a mass movement.

    “只有懒人，没有懒土”
    泾惠渠灌溉区的棉花近几年来一直减产的教训，是值得全国所有的农业工作干部密切注意的。
    几年来，西北区和陕西省的农业、水利领导机关，都没有找到灌溉区棉花逐年减产的真正原因。中央农业部一九五一年曾派人去作了调查，但也仅仅看到一些表面现象，没有提出具体的改进意见。因此，就没有能够及早地停止泾惠渠灌溉区棉花逐年减产的趋势，造成国家和当地群众的巨大损失。这一方面是因为他们缺乏深入实际深入群众的精神，一方面则是因为他们没有认真地学习科学技术和苏联的先进经验。这一次中央农业部、水利部组织的考察组，深入实际、深入群众作了细致周密的考察，并且在苏联专家的帮助下作了科学的研究分析，到底把泾惠渠灌溉区棉花减产的根本原因弄清楚了。如果早些这样做，早些认真地而不是草率地学习苏联先进经验，就会给国家和人民增加巨量的财富。
    这件事更清楚地证明了：“只有懒人，没有懒土。”不懂科学技术，缺乏具体领导，会把好地变成了坏地，而且几年还找不出根本的原因。这是一个惨痛的教训。今后各地农业领导干部和各县的领导干部都应当认真地钻研科学技术，特别是苏联先进经验；尽快地使自己真正成为领导农业生产的行家，并且要加强具体领导，细致地深入地做好宣传工作和组织工作，使改进农业技术真正成为群众自己的要求，成为群众性的运动。
