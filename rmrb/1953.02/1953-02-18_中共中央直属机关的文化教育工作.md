The amateur cultural supplementary schools of the departments directly under the CCP Central Committee began in July 1948. Over the past four years, they have gradually expanded and become more standardized, achieving significant results. Currently, there are fifteen amateur cultural supplementary schools with 359 classes and a total of more than 4,960 students. Junior high school classes account for about one-third, higher primary school classes account for about one-quarter, and lower primary school classes and literacy classes account for two-fifths. According to statistics from three departments' amateur cultural supplementary schools from 1949 to the end of 1951, 307 people graduated with a junior high school level in Chinese language. According to the statistics of one amateur cultural supplementary school, in the second half of 1952 compared with the second half of 1951, the number of people with a lower primary school level decreased by 13 percent, the number of people with a higher primary school level decreased by 10 percent, and the number of people with a junior high school level increased by 23 percent.

With the improvement of cultural levels, the political and professional levels of many cadres and staff have also improved, and they are more settled in their work in the departments. Therefore, the amateur cultural supplementary schools of the departments not only improve the cultural and professional level of the staff, but also greatly help the political work of the department branches.

Last September, the Party Committee of the departments directly under the Central Committee convened the first cultural and educational work conference of the departments directly under the Central Committee, summarizing the past work (especially the past year's work) and further recognizing the direction and requirements of cultural and educational work in the departments. This direction is "quick, practical, and yet standardized." The requirement is "we must organize all personnel to participate in learning as much as possible, and staff who have not graduated from junior high school must gradually reach a cultural level equivalent to junior high school graduation." Based on past experience and the implementation of Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method, a five-and-a-half-year schooling system was determined, that is, two years for primary school and three and a half years for junior high school. The curriculum is: primary school only studies Chinese (including quick literacy) and arithmetic, junior high school classes study Chinese, algebra, geometry, natural history, physiology and hygiene, physics, chemistry, history, and geography. In addition, measures were determined to basically eliminate illiteracy, improve teaching, and improve the political and professional level of teachers in the last semester of last year. This conference promoted the cultural and educational work of the departments a step forward. As of last November, we had basically organized all the comrades in the departments who needed to learn culture, including more than 1,500 illiterate and semi-literate people who were learning quick literacy. The enthusiasm for learning is generally high, and the student attendance rate has increased from an average of 80 percent a year ago to more than 96 percent.

We have the following experiences in running amateur cultural supplementary schools in the departments:
	(1)	The attention and specific leadership of leading cadres and the Party organizations of the departments to the cultural and educational work of the departments is the key to running amateur cultural supplementary schools well. The Party branch of the department should set up a special committee member to specifically lead the cultural and educational work. The specific leadership of the responsible comrades and the Party organizations of the departments should achieve: (1) Implementing the guidelines and requirements of the higher Party committee on cultural and educational work. The leadership should determine that all cadres and staff under the age of 50 who have not graduated from junior high school should be organized to participate in cultural learning (those who cannot participate in learning due to illness or other special reasons may not study temporarily). The principle of voluntariness should be adopted for cadres and staff over the age of 50, and the principle of focusing on cultural education must be adhered to for cadres and staff with a cultural level below junior high school graduation. The leadership should also help to constantly overcome various ideological obstacles; (2) Guaranteeing a certain amount of study time for the staff of the department; (3) Equipping cultural and educational work cadres and cultural teachers; (4) Solving the material needs of cultural and educational work as timely as possible (classrooms, teaching equipment, etc.); (5) Providing regular guidance to cultural and educational work, such as carefully reviewing teaching plans, summaries, and teaching materials.

	(2)	Giving a certain amount of study time to various staff participating in cultural learning is an important condition for guaranteeing cultural learning. Due to the different nature of the work of the staff in the departments, the arrangement of study time is very complicated. If it is not resolved well, it will inevitably cause a contradiction between work and study. We believe that in general, the "contracted" time for cultural learning per week can be stipulated as twelve hours (an average of two hours per day); that is, junior high school students, in addition to six hours of class per week, have six hours of homework and review; primary school students have eight hours of class per week and four hours of homework and review. Amateur cultural supplementary schools should stipulate the proportion of class and homework time for each subject according to needs. Teachers should set compulsory homework with the stipulated homework time as the standard. Only for students who really have more study time can more self-study homework be assigned. In addition, there are a small number of leading cadres, cadres on shift work, nursery workers, dispersed nursery workers, and cooks, whose study time is often not guaranteed or is not used and allocated reasonably. The solutions are: some can squeeze time themselves, some can organize mutual aid shift learning, and some need the administrative side to pay attention to giving them study time. In addition, amateur cultural supplementary schools and teachers should give these personnel as much care as possible, such as holding two classes in the same class and implementing a make-up class system.

(3)	In terms of curriculum, the primary school stage only stipulates the study of Chinese and arithmetic (history, geography, and nature are merged into the middle school curriculum), and basically adopts the method of single-subject advancement, that is, starting with the quick literacy method, concentrating all efforts to improve the level of Chinese. After studying for 320 hours in the first year and continuing to study for 80 hours in the second year (homework and review totaling 200 hours outside), the Chinese language can reach the equivalent of primary school graduation. In the second year, most of the time (six hours of class per week) is used to focus on learning arithmetic. After studying for 240 hours (homework and review totaling 120 hours outside), the arithmetic level of primary school graduation can be reached. In the junior high school stage, the method of advancing two subjects in parallel is adopted, that is, in addition to continuous study of Chinese, other subjects (physics and chemistry, natural history, physiology and hygiene, history, geography, algebra, geometry) adopt single-subject continuous advancement, so that energy is more concentrated, and the time is not prolonged (we used to stipulate that three courses should be studied at the same time, and energy was more dispersed. However, if only one course is studied, the study time will be prolonged). In this way, illiterates can be raised to a cultural level equivalent to junior high school graduation in five and a half years. The curriculum of the amateur cultural supplementary schools of the departments should include the main courses of regular schools. The idea that it must include all the courses of regular schools is inappropriate. However, if only one or two courses are supplemented, the effect of comprehensively improving the cultural level of students cannot be achieved. This is also inappropriate. In addition, this kind of school must also have formal systems such as attendance, performance, promotion, retention, and graduation.

(4)	After the problems of direction, requirements, time, schooling system, and curriculum are solved, efforts should be made to improve the teaching level. First of all, constantly improving the political and professional level of teachers is the central link in improving teaching effectiveness. We believe that cultural teachers must be organized into the regular theoretical, current affairs, and policy studies of the departments so that their political and theoretical level can be continuously improved. This is decisive for the improvement of business. We have taken the following measures to improve teaching methods: (1) All teachers are organized into teaching and research groups according to subjects, and teaching experiences are regularly studied and summarized; (2) Collective lesson preparation and trial teaching; (3) Organizing teaching visits and organizing reports on cultural and educational issues; (4) The Party Committee organizes teaching research meetings of various subjects to exchange experiences. Teachers in lower primary school classes can participate in a course of study in middle school classes. In terms of teaching ideology, it is necessary to oppose sticking to conventions and prevent the formalistic tendency of "speed without success."

Finally, there are still some difficulties at present. First, there are not enough teachers, especially middle school teachers. We believe that in addition to trying to recruit people from outside as much as possible, we should mainly rely on organizing cadres of the departments to be part-time teachers. Our existing part-time teachers account for 60 percent of all teachers. Cadres who serve as teachers should be given a certain amount of time and subsidies should be paid. In addition, departments that are close to the place of residence can jointly run schools. We now have 13 such joint supplementary schools, one of which includes nine units. Second, some courses do not yet have simplified teaching materials that are suitable for adults and are linked to reality. General school textbooks are not concise in content, and some are not suitable for the situation of the staff of the departments, which affects the progress and harvest of learning. We are now taking the following measures to solve this problem: (1) Organizing forces to compile; (2) Reviewing existing textbooks and selecting them for use; (3) Organizing the teaching and research group of teachers to temporarily compile teaching outlines.

    中共中央直属机关的文化教育工作
    刘火　刘勒
    中共中央直属机关的业余文化补习学校，自一九四八年七月开始创办，四年来逐步扩大，逐步走向正规，已获得了一些显著的成绩。现在共有十五个业余文化补习学校，三百五十九班，学员总数已达四千九百六十余人。初中班约占三分之一，高小班约占四分之一，初小班及速成识字班约占五分之二。根据三个机关业余文化补习学校自一九四九年至一九五一年底止的统计，初中语文程度毕业人数就有三百零七人，另据一个业余文化补习学校的统计，一九五二年下半年较一九五一年下半年，初小程度者减少百分之十三，高小程度者减少百分之十，初中程度者增加百分之二十三。
    随着文化水平的提高，许多干部与工作人员的政治水平与业务水平也提高了，他们安心机关工作了，所以机关业余文化补习学校不仅能提高机关工作人员文化业务水平，而且对机关支部的政治工作也有很大的帮助。
    去年九月，中直党委召开了中直机关第一次文化教育工作会议，总结了过去的（特别是过去一年的）工作，进一步认识到机关文化教育工作的方针与要求。这一方针即“速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的”。这个要求就是“必须尽可能地把全体人员都组织起来参加学习，不及初中毕业程度的工作人员必须逐渐达到相当初中毕业的文化程度”。根据过去的经验和推行祁建华速成识字法的情况，确定了五年半的学制，即小学二年，初中三年半。课程是：小学只读语文（包括速成识字）算术两门，初中班学习语文、代数、几何、博物、生理卫生、物理、化学、历史、地理。此外并确定在去年下学期内基本上扫除文盲、改进教学、提高教员政治、业务水平等措施。这次会议推动了机关文教工作前进一步。截至去年十一月止，我们已把机关全部需要学习文化的同志基本上组织起来了，其中包括了机关原有人员中学习速成识字的一千五百余名文盲半文盲。学习情绪普遍高涨，学员到课率已由一年前的平均数百分之八十提高到百分之九十六以上。
    我们在办理机关业余文化补习学校工作中有以下几点体会：
        （一）领导干部和机关党的组织对机关文化教育工作的重视与具体领导是办好机关业余文化补习学校的关键。机关党的支部应专设一个委员具体领导文化教育工作。机关负责同志和党的组织的具体领导应该做到：（1）贯彻上级党委关于文化教育工作的方针与要求，领导方面应该确定凡五十岁以下的干部和工作人员不够初中毕业程度者都要组织起来参加文化学习（因病或其它特殊原因不能参加学习者，经批准可暂时不学习），对年在五十岁以上的干部与工作人员采取自愿原则，对初中毕业程度以下文化水平的干部与工作人员必须坚持以文化教育为主的方针。领导方面并应帮助不断地克服各种思想上的障碍；（2）保证机关工作人员一定的学习时间；（3）配备文教工作干部与文化教员；（4）尽可能及时地解决文化教育工作上的物质需要（教室、教学设备等）；（5）对文化教育工作给以经常的指导，如认真审查教学计划、总结及教材等。
        （二）给参加文化学习的各种工作人员一定的学习时间是保证文化学习的重要条件。机关工作人员由于工作性质的不同，对学习时间的安排是十分复杂的，如果解决不好，势必造成工作与学习的矛盾。我们认为，一般的可以规定每周文化学习“包干”时间为十二小时（平均每天二小时）；即初中除每周上课六小时外，课外作业与复习六小时；小学每周上课八小时，作业复习四小时。业余文化补习学校应根据需要，规定各科上课与作业时间的比例，教员布置必修作业应以规定的作业时间为标准，只有对于确有更多学习时间的学员，才可以布置更多的自修作业。此外有少数领导干部、轮班工作制干部、托儿所保育员、分散的保育员和炊事员等，学习时间往往没有保证，或未尽合理使用与调配。解决办法是：有的可以自己挤时间，有的可以组织互助轮班学习，有的是需要行政方面注意给他们学习时间。另外业余文化补习学校和教员对这些人员应给以尽可能的照顾，如同一班上两次课，实行补课制等。
    （三）在课程方面，小学阶段只规定学语文、算术两门（史地、自然合并到中学课程中），基本上采用单科独进办法，即首先从速成识字法开始，集中全力提高语文程度。经第一年学习三百二十小时，第二年继续学习八十小时之后（作业复习共二百小时在外），语文即可达到相当小学毕业程度。第二年再以大部分时间（每周上课六小时）突击学习算术，经学习二百四十小时之后（作业复习共一百二十小时在外），可以达到小学毕业的算术程度。初中阶段采用两科并进的办法，即除语文连续学习外，其它各科（理化、博物、生理卫生、史、地、代数、几何）采取单科续进，如此精力比较集中，同时也不拖长时间（我们过去规定同时学习三门课程，精力比较分散。但如只学一门，又会延长学习时间）。这样就可以在五年半时间内把文盲提高到相当初中毕业文化程度。机关业余文化补习学校的课程，应该包括正规学校的主要课程。那种认为它必须包括正规学校全部课程的想法是不妥当的。但如果只补习一两门课程，也不能达到比较全面地提高学员文化水平的效果。这也是不妥当的。此外，这种学校也必须有考勤、考绩、升级、留级、毕业等正规制度。
        （四）在方针、要求、时间、学制、课程等问题解决之后，就应大力提高教学水平。首先，经常不断地提高教员的政治水平与业务水平，乃是提高教学效果的中心一环。我们认为必须把文化教员组织到机关经常的理论、时事、政策的学习中去，使他们的政治理论水平能不断提高。这对业务的提高是具有决定意义的。在改进教学方法上我们采取了以下办法：（1）把所有的教员按科编成教学研究小组，经常研究、总结教学经验；（2）集体备课与试教；（3）组织参观教学及组织有关文化教育问题的报告；（4）由党委组织各科教学研究会交流经验。程度低的小学班教员可以参加中学班学习一门课程。在教学思想上，既要反对墨守成规，又要防止“速而不成”的形式主义偏向。
    最后，目前还存在着一些困难。第一，教员人数不够，特别是中学教员人数不够。我们认为除尽量争取从外边调人解决外，主要应靠组织机关干部做兼任教员。我们现有的兼任教员占全体教员人员的百分之六十。对担任教员的干部应给他们一定的时间，并发给补贴。另外是住地接近的机关可联合举办。我们现在已有这样的联合补习学校十三所，其中有一所就包括了九个单位。第二，有些课程还没有适合于成人的、联系实际的、精简的教材。一般学校课本，内容不简炼，有的不适合机关工作人员的情况，因而就影响了学习的进度与收获。我们现在采取以下办法来解决：（1）组织力量选编；（2）审查现有课本，选择采用；（3）组织教员的教学研究小组，暂编教学提纲。
