Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Korean People's Army, in its just war against the American aggressors, has grown stronger and stronger in battle, achieving brilliant victories on all fronts.

    On the ground front, the People's Army units have fought more closely alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers in the past year or so, completely stabilizing the front line near the 38th parallel, annihilating a large number of enemy troops, and preventing the enemy from advancing an inch. The large-scale tunnel warfare, widespread anti-aircraft shooting movement, and mass sniper movement carried out by the People's Army infantry defending this line have all achieved glorious results.

    In the course of the fierce war, the People's Army has cultivated many heroic units and heroic figures. For example, the People's Army unit led by the distinguished General Choi Hyun has fought in both North and South Korea for more than two years, annihilating more than 180,000 enemy troops and capturing and destroying more than 850 enemy guns of various types, more than 290 aircraft, and 389 tanks. In the fierce battles, this unit produced a total of 69 "Republic Heroes," including many heroic martyrs who blocked enemy fire with their bodies, sacrificing themselves to ensure victory. In addition, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers have been awarded various medals and decorations by the government.

    The rapidly growing People's Army artillery units are inflicting increasingly heavy blows on the enemy. They inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy in the "Heartbreak Ridge" battle. Recently, an artillery company of the People's Army guarding a certain front line destroyed four enemy heavy guns, four tractors, fifteen vehicles, and twelve tents, and killed many enemy officers and soldiers in a fierce 40-minute artillery battle. According to incomplete statistics, the People's Army artillery units destroyed more than 360 enemy guns of various types, 207 tanks, and 3,516 firing points, and killed or wounded more than 25,000 enemy troops in the past year alone. Because of their brilliant achievements, 34 people from the People's Army artillery units have been awarded the title of "Republic Hero," and tens of thousands have been awarded various medals and decorations.

    The People's Army's engineering units heroically and tenaciously built bridges and roads, removed or set up various obstacles, and built strong tunnel fortifications for the combat troops, which played a significant role in ensuring victory in battle. The engineers also widely organized tank assault teams to destroy a large number of enemy tanks. In the past year, a certain engineering unit destroyed a total of 144 enemy tanks and more than 30 vehicles.

    On the coastal defense front, the People's Army naval units and coastal artillery have also made great contributions. The glorious achievement of Republic Hero Kim Kun-ok commanding four torpedo boats to sink an enemy heavy cruiser has been inspiring the naval warriors to victoriously resist the American maritime bandits. In total, over the past two years, the naval units have sunk one enemy cruiser, 19 destroyers, and 31 minesweepers and other ships, and damaged four cruisers and one destroyer in mine-laying operations, torpedo attacks, and naval battles. The coastal artillery has sunk 13 enemy destroyers and 35 minesweepers, landing craft, etc., and damaged two cruisers, 27 destroyers, and 14 minesweepers, etc.

    In the fierce battle to defend the motherland's airspace day and night, the People's Army Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units have also severely打击 (dǎ jī) the American aerial bandits who are madly slaughtering peaceful residents. Thirteen young Korean air force pilots have been awarded the title of "Republic Hero," and thousands of air force personnel have been awarded various medals and decorations. The team of air force warriors led by Tae Keun-seong shot down or damaged 43 enemy planes in more than 50 air battles during the ten days or so in April 1952. The air force warriors also accurately bombed the enemy's outposts, airfields, assembly points, and ports hundreds of times. Due to the close cooperation between the People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery units and the Chinese People's Volunteers' anti-aircraft artillery units, thousands of enemy planes have been shot down, forcing the once rampant American aerial bandits to change from low-altitude flying to high-altitude flying, and from daytime flying to nighttime flying. The various branches of the Korean People's Army, with their brilliant achievements and ever-increasing strength, are further cooperating closely with the Chinese People's Volunteers on all fronts to continue to achieve new victories and actively prepare to crush any military adventures that the American aggressors attempt to launch, in order to welcome the fifth anniversary of the "February 8th" Army Day.

    朝鲜人民军战绩辉煌愈战愈强
    据新华社讯：朝鲜人民军在抗击美国侵略者的正义战争中，愈战愈强，在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在地面战线上，人民军部队在过去一年多以来和中国人民志愿军更加密切地并肩作战，将正面战线完全稳定在三八线附近，大量歼灭了敌人有生力量，使敌人无法前进一步。防守在这条战线上的人民军步兵所进行的大规模坑道战、广泛的对空射击运动和群众性的狙击运动，都获得了光辉战果。
    在激烈的战争过程中，人民军已经锻炼出了许多英雄部队与英雄人物。例如：战功卓著的崔贤将军率领的人民军某军团，两年多以来，转战南北朝鲜，已歼灭敌军十八万人以上，并缴获和击毁敌军各种炮八百五十多门、飞机二百九十多架、坦克三百八十九辆。在历次激烈的战斗中，该军团一共涌现了“共和国英雄”六十九人，其中包括以肉体挡住敌火力口、舍身保证胜利的英雄烈士多人。另有数万名军官和士兵荣获政府的各种勋章和奖章。
    迅速成长壮大的人民军炮兵部队，正给予敌人日益沉重的打击。他们在“伤心岭”战斗中曾使敌人遭受十分惨重的损失。最近，守卫在某战线上的人民军一个炮兵连，在四十分钟的激烈炮战中，就摧毁敌军重炮四门、牵引车四辆、汽车十五辆、帐篷十二座，并击毙敌军官兵多人。据不完全统计，人民军炮兵部队在去年一年中，共击毁敌军各种炮三百六十多门、坦克二百零七辆、火力点三千五百十六个，毙伤敌军二万五千多人。人民军的各炮兵部队由于建立了辉煌的功勋，共有三十四人荣获“共和国英雄”称号，数万人荣获各种勋章和奖章。
    人民军的工兵部队英勇顽强地替战斗部队修桥筑路、排除或设置各种障碍物、构筑坚强的坑道工事，对于保障战斗胜利起了很大的作用。工兵们并广泛组织坦克袭击组，大量击毁敌人的坦克，某工兵部队在过去一年的战斗中，共击毁敌军坦克一百四十四辆、汽车三十多辆。
    在海防战线上，人民军海军部队和海岸炮兵也立下了巨大的功勋。共和国英雄金君钰指挥四艘鱼雷艇击沉敌人一艘重巡洋舰的光辉战绩，一直鼓舞着海军勇士们胜利地抗击美国海上强盗。总计两年多以来，海军部队在敷雷作战、鱼雷攻击作战和海战中，共击沉敌巡洋舰一艘、驱逐舰十九艘、扫雷艇及其他舰艇三十一艘，击伤巡洋舰四艘、驱逐舰一艘。海岸炮兵共击沉敌驱逐舰十三艘、扫雷艇、登陆艇等共三十五艘，击伤巡洋舰两艘、驱逐舰二十七艘、扫雷艇等十四艘。
    在日夜保卫祖国领空的激烈战斗中，人民军空军和高射炮部队也沉重地打击了疯狂屠杀和平居民的美国空中强盗。年青的朝鲜空军驾驶员们，已经有十三人荣获“共和国英雄”称号，此外还有空军人员数千人荣获各种勋章和奖章。由太克成率领的一队空军勇士们，在一九五二年四月间的十多天内进行的五十多次空战中，共打落打伤敌机四十三架。空军勇士们并成百次地准确轰炸了敌军的前哨基地、飞机场、集结处和港口。由于人民军高射炮部队和中国人民志愿军高射炮部队密切配合作战，击落了数以千计的敌机，迫使猖狂一时的美国空中强盗已经不得不从低空飞行改变为高空飞行，从日间飞行改变为夜间飞行。战果辉煌而日益强大的朝鲜人民军各兵种部队，为了迎接“二·八”建军节五周年纪念，正在各个战线上与中国人民志愿军进一步密切配合作战，继续取得新的胜利，并积极准备粉碎美国侵略者所企图发动的任何军事冒险。
