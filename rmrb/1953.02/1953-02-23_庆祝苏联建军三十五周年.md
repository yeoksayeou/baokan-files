Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army

Today, February 23rd, is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. The Chinese people and progressive people all over the world are warmly and sincerely celebrating this significant holiday. Over the past thirty-five years, the Soviet Army has traversed a glorious path of battle. When the great October Socialist Revolution broke through the capitalist front and established the first socialist state in one-sixth of the world’s land, the reactionary forces at home and abroad tried their best to overthrow the young Soviet regime by military attack. However, the new type of Red Army, established under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, overcame tremendous difficulties, smashed the rebellions of domestic reactionary forces and the armed intervention of fourteen imperialist countries with unparalleled heroism, and paved the way for the Soviet people to peacefully build socialism. During World War II, German fascists, who rampaged across Western Europe, along with their elite main forces and the armies of their European vassal states, perfidiously launched a sudden attack on the Soviet Union, occupied much of Soviet territory, and approached Moscow. At that time, people in various countries around the world were very concerned about this serious situation, while those imperialists who were hostile to the Soviet Union were pleased, thinking that the end of the Soviet Union had arrived. But the end of the war ended with the complete shattering of the imperialists' illusions. Under the leadership of the great and talented commander Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Army annihilated 10 million fascist German and vassal troops, recovered all the invaded territory, and liberated the European people under fascist enslavement. After thoroughly defeating Fascist Germany, the Soviet Army turned its guns eastward and eliminated the elite of the Japanese imperialist army – the Kwantung Army – helping our people liberate the Northeast region, winning the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and at the same time helping the Korean people liberate the northern territory of Korea, enabling the Korean people to embark on the road of independence and liberation, thereby forcing the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally. The Soviet people and the Soviet Army went through the greatest difficulties and made extremely glorious contributions to mankind.

The Soviet Army is the defender of the Soviet people's happy life and the maintainer of the peaceful lives of people all over the world. Therefore, the Soviet Army is sincerely loved and supported by the Soviet people and the working people all over the world. Advanced people all over the world realize that the strength of the Soviet Army is not only in the interests of the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of all mankind. Comrade Stalin pointed out when celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the Soviet Army:

"The first basic characteristic of our Red Army is that it is an army of the working and peasant masses who have been liberated, an army of the October Revolution, and an army of the dictatorship of the proletariat." "The second characteristic of our Red Army lies in the fact that it is an army that consolidates the fraternal friendship between all the nationalities in our country, an army that liberates all the previously oppressed nationalities in our country, and an army that defends the freedom and independence of all the nationalities in our country." "Finally, we must talk about the third characteristic of the Red Army. This characteristic lies in the fact that the spirit of internationalism is cultivated and consolidated in our army, and our entire Red Army is permeated with the spirit of internationalism." This is the fundamental reason why the Soviet Army is invincible.

The Soviet Army is armed with advanced military science. Comrade Stalin developed the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on war and the army, and absorbed all the excellent elements of military art in history. With an unsurpassable scientific depth, he gave a scientific and complete solution to all the problems of winning victory in modern warfare. It is the most advanced military science, it is the military science of victory, and no bourgeois military science can compare with it. The fascist army, which made the armies of many countries in Western Europe panic-stricken, was thoroughly crushed by the Soviet Army. This is an irrefutable ironclad proof. The victory of worldwide historical significance in defeating German fascism and Japanese imperialism is the victory of Soviet military science.

The Soviet Army is a great example and close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After liberating the Northeast region of China, the Soviet Army, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance of 1950, the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou and Dalian, and the 1952 Exchange of Notes on Extending the Term of Joint Use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base, is stationed in Lushunkou and, together with our People's Liberation Army, jointly defends the security of strategic locations in the Far East, and jointly strives to prevent the re-aggression of Japan or any country colluding with Japan in aggressive acts. In his congratulatory telegram to Comrade Stalin on the seventh anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1952, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Now, as Japanese militarism is being revived and Japanese aggressive forces are raising their heads again, the unbreakable friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for jointly preventing the re-aggression of Japan and any other country colluding with Japan in aggressive acts, and for defending peace in the East and the world." In his congratulatory telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Stalin said: "The great friendship between the USSR and the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East and throughout the world." The stationing of Soviet troops in Lushunkou is a concentrated manifestation of the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union. The entire Chinese people express their highest respect and sincere gratitude to the Soviet troops who have come to China from far away from their motherland to undertake defense duties.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is extremely proud to stand side by side with the powerful and invincible Soviet Army at the forefront of defending peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is learning with great enthusiasm from the Soviet Army's fine political qualities, lofty patriotism and internationalism, learning from their advanced military science and technology, military command art, and experience in coordinated operations among various services and arms, learning from their high degree of organization and discipline, and various advanced systems and styles, in order to accelerate the achievement of modernization. Ensuring the success of this study is the most important task of the Chinese People's Liberation Army at present.

    庆祝苏联建军三十五周年
    今天——二月二十三日是苏联军队三十五周年建军节，中国人民和全世界的进步人民都在热烈地衷心地祝贺这个具有重大意义的节日。三十五年来，苏联军队经历了光荣的战斗道路。当伟大的十月社会主义革命冲破了资本主义的战线，在世界六分之一的土地上建立了第一个社会主义国家的时候，苏联国内外的反动势力，就极力想以武力的进攻来推翻年轻的苏维埃国家政权；但在列宁和斯大林领导下建立起来的新型的红军，克服了巨大的困难，以无比的英勇，粉碎了国内反动势力的叛乱和十四个帝国主义国家的武装干涉，铺平了苏联人民和平建设社会主义的道路。第二次世界大战时，横行西欧各国的德国法西斯，挟其精锐主力及其欧洲附庸国的军队，背信弃义地突然向苏联进攻，侵占了苏联许多国土，并一直逼近了莫斯科。当时，世界各国的人民都曾十分关注这种严重形势，而那些对苏联抱有敌意的帝国主义者却欣然以为苏联的末日到了；但战争的结局却以帝国主义者幻想的彻底破灭而告终了。苏联军队在伟大的天才统帅斯大林同志的领导下，歼灭了法西斯德国及其附庸国军队一千万人，收复了全部被侵略的国土，并解放了法西斯奴役下的欧洲人民。苏联军队在彻底击败了法西斯德国以后，又挥戈东向，消灭了日本帝国主义军队的精锐——关东军，帮助我国人民解放了东北地区，取得抗日战争的胜利，同时帮助朝鲜的人民解放了朝鲜北部领土，使朝鲜人民走上独立解放的道路，并从而迫使日本政府无条件投降。苏联人民和苏联军队经历了最大的困难，对世界人类作了极其光辉的贡献。
    苏联军队是苏联人民幸福生活的保卫者，也是全世界各国人民和平生活的维护者；所以苏联军队受到了苏联人民和全世界劳动人民竭诚的爱戴和拥护。全世界先进人类都认识到：苏联军队的强大不但是苏联的利益，而且是全人类的利益。斯大林同志在庆祝苏联军队诞生十周年的时候，曾经指出：
    “我们红军底第一个基本特点，就是在于它是已经获得解放的工农群众底军队，是十月革命底军队，是无产阶级专政底军队。”“我们红军底第二个特点，就在于它是巩固我国各民族彼此间兄弟友谊关系底军队，是解放我国先前各被压迫民族的军队，是保卫我国各民族自由独立的军队。”“最后，就要说到红军底第三个特点。这个特点就在于我们军队中培养和巩固着的是国际主义精神，我们全部红军都浸透着国际主义精神。”这就是苏联军队战无不胜的根本原因。
    苏联军队是以先进的军事科学武装起来的。斯大林同志发展了马克思、列宁主义关于战争和军队的学说，并吸取了历史上军事艺术中一切优秀的成分，以不可超越的科学的深刻性，对现代战争取得胜利的一切问题，都给了科学的完满的解决。它是最先进的军事科学，是胜利的军事科学，任何资产阶级的军事科学都无法和它相比拟。曾使西欧许多国家的军队望风披靡的法西斯军队，却被苏联军队彻底粉碎了，这就是无可辩驳的铁证。击败德国法西斯和日本帝国主义的有全世界历史意义的胜利，就是苏联军事科学的胜利。
    苏联军队是中国人民解放军的伟大榜样和亲密战友。在解放了中国的东北地区以后，苏联军队又根据一九五○年中苏友好同盟互助条约、关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定和一九五二年关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文，驻防旅顺口，和我国人民解放军共同保卫远东战略要地的安全，共同为防止日本或其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家的重新侵略而努力。毛泽东同志在一九五二年庆祝抗日战争胜利七周年致斯大林同志的贺电中说：“现在，当着日本军国主义正在复活，日本侵略势力又重新抬头的时候，中国与苏联的牢不可破的友好同盟是共同制止日本和其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略、保卫东方与世界和平的有力保证。”斯大林同志在致毛泽东同志的贺电中说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”苏联军队的驻防旅顺口，正是中苏两国伟大同盟的集中的表现。全中国人民对于远离祖国来到中国担任防务的苏联军队都表示崇高的敬意和衷诚的感谢。
    中国人民解放军以与强大无敌的苏联军队并肩立于保卫远东和世界和平的最前列而感到无比的骄傲。中国人民解放军正以高度的热情学习苏联军队的优良的政治品质、崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习他们的先进的军事科学技术、军事指挥艺术以及各兵种协同作战的经验，学习他们的高度的组织性和纪律性以及各种先进的制度和作风，以加速达到现代化的水平。保证这个学习的成功乃是中国人民解放军当前最重大的任务。
