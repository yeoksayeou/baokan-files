Editor's Note: After this newspaper published a reader's letter on February 1 criticizing the Henan Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River for stockpiling cement and causing serious waste, a large number of readers continued to write letters exposing similar incidents in water conservancy construction projects. From these letters, we can see that the phenomenon of stockpiling and wasting materials is still prevalent in several major water conservancy construction projects, fully exposing the irresponsible ideological style of the staff in these units towards national wealth. They not only do not feel heartbroken about the phenomenon of wasting materials from all over the country in support of harnessing the Huai River, but instead dismiss it lightly by saying, "The Huai River's assets are really big!" What is especially bad is that some people even try to write off these wasted materials in the project budget. We suggest that the Huai River Commission and the Daishuzhengzhi Committee thoroughly investigate and seriously deal with such incidents; and we hope that the majority of readers will continue to expose the phenomenon of waste in water conservancy construction projects.

Should check the phenomenon of wasting materials in water conservancy construction

The Material Management System of the Henan Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River is Extremely Chaotic

Ruan Jiahai writes: The material management system of the Henan Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River is extremely chaotic. Some of the materials in stock have no accounts at all, and even those with accounts do not match the materials. Among the seventeen units that store materials, there is not a single place where the materials match the accounts. For example, the newly established Nanwan Reservoir recently cleared out 480 catties of kerosene that were not on the books; the material account recorded 48 dump trucks, but in fact there were only 48 buckets. A large batch of electric wires was transported to the Boshan Reservoir and used without any formalities. There are even more materials not on the books at the Baisha Reservoir. For the item of iron hammers alone, there are more than 800; there are also more than 70 kinds of materials that were returned as赃 during the "Three-Anti" campaign, and have not yet been checked and entered into the account.

It is precisely because the department does not have a strict material management system that the storage work is very poor, and the situation of material waste is very serious. The Baisha Reservoir has more than 50,000 carrying baskets, which have rotted because they have been left in the open for too long. Along the highway from Xuchang to Baisha, light rails are left all along the way. Most of the fuel in each material unit is not covered, and the bottom of the cylinders are mostly rusted and leaking oil. There are more than 300 dump trucks stored in Zhumadian, and no one is guarding them. The buckets and frames are separated and have become residents' cesspools. The Xinyang warehouse has more than 14,000 shovels in stock, which have not been used for two or three years, and most of them are now rusted.

Some cadres in the department saw that a large number of materials were being damaged, but instead of taking the initiative to find ways to save them, they said indifferently: "The Huai River's assets are really big!" Some people even said: "It doesn't matter if these cements have deteriorated, they can be written off for a few culvert and reservoir projects!"

Many Valuable Materials in the Huai River Area are Discarded and Thrown Away Randomly

Huang Liqun writes: The Material Section of the Finance Department of the Huai River Commission does not pay attention to material storage, and coupled with poor planning, it has seriously wasted national materials. A warehouse of the Sub-bureau of the Huai River Control Headquarters in northern Jiangsu put explosives in a dark and humid corner for a year, and now it has been damp and cannot be used. Several directly affiliated engineering units in the middle reaches, such as the Fozi Ridge, have stockpiled a large amount of rosin and bitumen. Steel rails and dump trucks stored at the Xiacaowan construction site have been buried in the soil. The dump trucks at the Chongtong River construction site are used as water tanks, and the sleepers are used to pave roads. 6,000 tons of cement are stockpiled in the upper reaches of the Huai River, and most of it has deteriorated. They also blindly transferred 1,000 tons to various construction sites downstream, wasting a sum of freight for nothing. In 1950, the Material Section purchased 2,500 stone rollers and stored them in Huaiyuan County. Later, 1,000 were requisitioned, and 1,500 were scattered on the river beach. Once the river rises, they will be submerged, and no one has asked about them until now. Many valuable materials are discarded and thrown away randomly like this, but a warehouse in Huai'an carefully keeps the urinals, not only placing them on shelves, but also indicating the caliber size and specifications.

In August last year, they bought three sawing machines for 300 million yuan. Fearing that the central government would uniformly allocate them, they rushed to build a wood processing factory at the end of the year. The construction cost of the factory building reached 300 million yuan. It is planned to start production this year. However, the wood needed by each construction site this year is only more than 1,600 cubic meters, and the two sawing machines that have been installed can produce 30 cubic meters per day. That is to say, only two sawing machines can complete the wood required this year in less than two months. This is another huge waste. I hope the Huai River Commission will pay attention to this situation.

The Shandong Provincial Committee for Guiding the Shu River and Rectifying the Yi River Irresponsibly Mines and Transfers Blocks of Stone

Lu Jie writes: The Shandong Provincial Committee for Guiding the Shu River and Rectifying the Yi River does not pay attention to material management, causing losses to national property. In the autumn of 1951, a large batch of cement was shipped from East China. After unloading at A'hu Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, it was stored in the open air, and later 30,000 jin were wetted by rain. From July to August 1952, a certain stone quarry mined 20,000 cubic meters of stone blocks, which were prepared for dams and revetments. It was found that the stone quality was poor when it was first mined, but they still irresponsibly continued to mine it. As a result, 4,000 cubic meters of the 20,000 cubic meters of stone could not be used. In the winter of the same year, the revetment project of the Yi River was initially planned to use 5,000 cubic meters of stone blocks, but later it was changed to 3,200 cubic meters of stone blocks. This project change has been notified to all relevant departments by the association, but the association still transported 5,000 cubic meters of stone blocks to the construction site according to the original plan. After it was discovered, it was transferred to other construction sites, wasting a large amount of loading, unloading and transportation costs. The above three things alone wasted 114 million yuan. It is recommended that they seriously review and improve.

The Chaotic Work of the Boshan Reservoir Construction Office Has Caused More Than 100 Workers to Wait for Work for 27 Days

Sun Fushun, Tian Fu, and Xiao Laibin write: We are workers of the Stone Workers Team of the Second Brigade of the Mechanical Corps of the Henan Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River. On November 20 last year, we signed a contract for 40 working days with the Baisha Reservoir Office. However, after working for one day on November 21, we were transferred to the Boshan Reservoir. However, the Boshan Reservoir Construction Office did not prepare stone workers' tools at all. Our entire team of 107 workers could not work, so we had to idle, and each person received a "waiting work subsidy" of 5,000 yuan per day to maintain their lives. By December 24, we had been idle for 27 days and still could not start work. This not only reduced the income of our workers, made the country waste more than 14 million yuan in "waiting work subsidies" for nothing, but also affected the progress of the project.

We believe that this situation is intolerable. The Boshan Reservoir Construction Office should review this matter and deal with it seriously.

Fengfeng Coal Mine, etc., Violate Government Regulations
and Sign Contracts with Private Merchants, Prepaying Large Amounts of Deposits

Li Run writes: In mid-November 1952, the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine sent people to Beijing to purchase electric blueprint machines. According to the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, foreign procurement units must go through the Municipal Trust Company to handle the procedures for purchasing materials in Beijing, and the maximum deposit prepaid shall not exceed 25% of the price. However, the mine violated government regulations and signed a contract with Beijing's private Xingshun Electrical Factory without authorization, prepaying a deposit of 54% (46 million yuan per unit, prepaying a deposit of 25 million yuan).

On December 20, 1952, the Repair and Assembly Factory of the Central Geological Department ordered a power distribution board from the private merchant Xingshun Electrical Factory for a price of 30 million yuan. Although a contract was signed through the Municipal Trust Company at that time, and the contract also stipulated that only a deposit of 25% should be paid, the Repair and Assembly Factory privately violated the contract and prepaid Xingshun Electrical Factory a deposit of 18 million yuan (accounting for 60% of the price).

These practices are serious violations of policy, which not only accumulate state funds, but also encourage private merchants to raise order conditions. It is hoped that the leading cadres of Fengfeng Coal Mine and the Repair and Assembly Factory of the Central Geological Department will check these mistakes.

Suggestion to Add an "Alphabetical Index" to the Dictionary

Cao Jizi writes: The creation and promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" has enabled many workers and peasants to recognize about 2,000 single characters in a very short period of time. They are eager to read and write. When reading and writing, they inevitably encounter unfamiliar characters that they cannot recognize or write. When they encounter these difficulties, they often have to resort to dictionaries. However, general dictionaries published now can only help solve the difficulties encountered when reading unfamiliar characters; and they cannot help solve the difficulties encountered when writing unfamiliar characters that they cannot write and do not know the radicals. Recently, I saw the "Learning Culture Dictionary" compiled by the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office of Beijing Normal University, which has an "Alphabetical Index". This method is very good. If the reader only knows the sound of a character, they can also find it in the table according to the phonetic order of the phonetic symbols. It is hoped that other dictionary compilers will do the same.

### 读者来信摘要

第2版()
专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：二月一日本报发表了读者批评河南省治淮总指挥部积压水泥造成严重浪费的来信以后，广大读者继续来信揭发水利建设工程中的类似事件。从这些来信中我们可以看到：积压和糟蹋器材的现象在几个主要水利建设工程中还普遍地存在着，充分暴露了这些单位的工作人员对国家财富严重不负责任的思想作风。他们对于浪费全国人民大力支援治淮的物资的现象不但不感到痛心，反而轻描淡写地说：“治淮的家当真大啊！”尤其恶劣的，是有的人还企图将这些浪费了的器材在工程预算中报销。我们建议治淮委员会、导沭整沂委员会彻底检查并严肃处理此类事件；并希望广大读者继续揭发水利建设工程中的浪费现象。
    应该检查水利建设中浪费器材的现象
    河南省治淮总指挥部器材管理制度十分混乱
    阮家灏来信：河南省治淮总指挥部的器材管理制度十分混乱，库存的器材有的根本没有帐，有帐的也料不符帐。在十七个保管器材的单位中，没有一处是料帐相符合的。例如最近刚建立的南湾水库，就清查出帐外煤油四百八十斤；料帐上记有斗车四十八辆，事实上只有斗子四十八个。薄山水库运到大批电线，未经任何手续即拿去使用。白沙水库不在帐的器材更多，仅铁锤一项，即有八百余把；还有“三反”时退赃来的器材七十余种，到现在还没有验收入帐。
    正因为该部没有严格的器材保管制度，所以保管工作很差，器材浪费的情况也就很严重。白沙水库有五万多个抬筐，因为露天搁置太久，现在已经腐烂。从许昌到白沙的公路上，沿途均遗留有轻便铁轨。各器材单位的油料大部分没有遮盖，筒底多已锈坏漏油。驻马店存有三百多辆斗车，没有人看管，斗与架分离，成为居民的粪坑。信阳仓库存有铁锹一万四千余把，两三年没用过，目前多已锈蚀。
    该部有些干部看到大批器材在损坏着，不但不主动设法挽救，反而毫不在乎地说：“治淮的家当真大啊！”有的人居然说：“这些变了质的水泥没关系，几个涵闸水库工程就可以报销了！”
    治淮地区许多贵重器材乱丢乱扔
    黄立群来信：治淮委员会财务部器材处不重视器材保管工作，再加上计划不周，以致严重地浪费了国家物资。苏北治淮指挥部所属某仓库把炸药放在阴暗潮湿的屋角里达一年之久，现在已受潮不能使用。中游的几个直属工程单位，如佛子岭就积压了大批松香柏油。下草湾工地存放的钢轨、斗车已经被埋到土里去了。漴潼河工地的斗车被当做水缸用，枕木用来铺路。淮河上游地区积压六千吨水泥，现在大部分已变了质。他们还盲目地调拨了一千吨到下游各工地，白白地浪费了一笔运费。一九五○年器材处购买了二千五百个石硪，存放在怀远县。后来调用了一千个，还有一千五百个大部散放在河滩上，河水一涨，即被淹没，至今仍无人过问。很多贵重的器材这样乱丢乱放，但淮安某仓库却把尿壶保管得很细致，不但放在架子上，而且注明口径大小和规格。
    去年八月间他们以三亿元买了三部锯木机，怕中央要统一调拨，因而在年底赶建木料加工工厂。厂房建筑费达三亿元。准备今年开工生产。但各工地今年所需木料只要一千六百余立方公尺，而已经装好的两部锯木机每日可生产三十立方公尺。就是说仅两部锯木机在不到两个月的时间就可完成本年所需的木料。这又是巨大的浪费。希望治淮委员会重视这一情况。
    山东省导沭整沂委员会不负责任地开采调运块石
    陆介来信：山东省导沭整沂委员会不重视器材管理，使国家资财受到损失。一九五一年秋季由华东运到大批水泥，在陇海路东段阿湖站卸车后，露天存放，后来下雨就淋湿了三万斤。一九五二年七八月间某石场开采块石两万方，准备供拦河坝和护坡用。刚开采时就发现石质不良，但仍不负责任地采下去了，结果两万方石头中有四千方不能使用。同年冬季，沂河的护岸工程起初计划用块石五千方，后改为块石三千二百方。这一工程更改，该会已通知各有关部门，但该会仍按照原计划把五千方块石运到工地。经发觉后才转运到其他工地，浪费了大批装卸费和运费。仅上述三件事，即浪费一亿一千四百万元。建议他们认真检讨和改进。
    薄山水库施工处工作混乱已使百余工人待工二十七天
    孙福顺、田福、萧来宾来信：我们是河南省治淮总指挥部机械总队第二大队石工中队的工人。去年十一月二十日，我们与白沙水库办事处订好了四十个工作日的合同。可是，我们在十一月二十一日工作了一天，就被调到薄山水库。而薄山水库施工处却根本没有准备石工的工具。我们全队一百零七个工人没法工作，只好闲着，每人每天领“待工补助费”五千元来维持生活。到十二月二十四日，我们已经闲住了二十七天还不能开始工作。这不但使我们工人收入减少，使国家白白浪费了一千四百多万元的“待工补助费”，并且也会影响工程的进度。
    我们认为：这种情况是令人不能容忍的。薄山水库施工处应对这件事进行检讨，并对这件事作严肃的处理。
    峰峰煤矿等违反政府规定
    和私商订合同预付大量定金
    李润来信：国营峰峰煤矿于一九五二年十一月中旬派人到北京采购电动晒图机。按政务院财政经济委员会及北京市人民政府的规定，外地采购单位在北京采购物资必须通过市信托公司办理手续，预付定金最高不得超过价款的百分之二十五。但该矿竟违反政府规定，擅自与北京市私营兴顺电机工厂订立合同，预付定金百分之五十四（每架四千六百万元，预付定金二千五百万元）。
    中央地质部修配厂于一九五二年十二月二十日向私商兴顺电机工厂定购配电盘一具，价款三千万元，虽然当时经过市信托公司订立了合同，合同中虽亦规定了只付定金百分之二十五，但该修配厂竟私自违反合同预付兴顺电机工厂定金一千八百万元（占价款百分之六十）。
    这些作法都是严重违反政策的行为，既积压了国家资金，又助长了私商提高定货条件。希望峰峰煤矿和中央地质部修配厂领导干部对这些错误加以检查。    
    建议字典附增“音序检字表”
    曹积梓来信：“速成识字法”的创造和推广，使很多工农群众在很短时期内就认识了两千上下的单字。他们迫切要求阅读和写作。在阅读和写作时，免不了要遇到一些认不得或写不来的生字。他们碰到这些困难，经常只能求助于字典。但现在出版的一般字典，只能帮助解决阅读时碰到生字的困难；而对在写作时碰到不会写又不知道偏旁部首的生字的困难，就无法帮助解决了。最近，我看到北京师范大学中国大辞典编纂处编的“学文化字典”，附有一种“音序检字表”，这个办法是很好的。读者如果只知道一个字的音，也可从该表中按注音符号的拼音次序查到。希望其他字典的编纂者，也这样地来做。
