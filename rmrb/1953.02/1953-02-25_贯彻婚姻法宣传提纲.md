Outline for Propaganda on Implementing the Marriage Law
Central Committee for the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign

I. What is the Basic Spirit of the Marriage Law?

The basic spirit of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is the content stipulated in Articles 1 and 2 of the Marriage Law: "Abolish the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male supremacy, and disregard for the interests of children. Implement a new-democratic marriage system of free marriage for both men and women, monogamy, equal rights for both men and women, and protection of the legitimate rights and interests of women and children." "Bigamy and concubinage are prohibited. Child brides are prohibited. Interference in the marriage freedom of widows is prohibited. It is prohibited for anyone to extort property by taking advantage of marriage issues."

(1) The first basic principle of the Marriage Law is to abolish arranged and forced marriages and implement free marriage for both men and women. In the old society, the marriage of young men and women was arranged or forced by their parents, and therefore not free. Now, such feudal old rules should no longer be implemented. Now, new-democratic rules are to be implemented, which is that "marriage must be based on the complete free will of both men and women, and neither party shall be forced by the other party, nor shall any third party interfere." This means that children should be allowed to decide their own marriage matters, allow them to freely choose their desired partner, and based on mutual willingness, the two parties should go to the government to register and apply for marriage. Of course, young men and women can and should solicit the opinions of their parents regarding marriage, and can also solicit the opinions of other people. It is also permissible for parents to introduce marriage partners to their children. However, if the children do not agree with this partner, they are completely free to reject the orders of their parents, and if the parents do not agree with the partner that the children themselves like, the children are also completely free to ignore the orders of their parents and marry on their own. Generally speaking, parents certainly want to find a suitable partner for their children, but the parents' views, temperament, and motives may not be the same as those of their children. What parents think is good, children may not agree with. Therefore, marriage should be decided by the children themselves, and not by the parents. This is completely reasonable and appropriate.

The so-called freedom of marriage includes both freedom of marriage and freedom of divorce. Without either aspect, true freedom of marriage cannot be realized. Freedom of marriage is the primary aspect, because only with freedom of marriage, and only when both parties to the marriage are completely willing, can a democratic, harmonious, and united productive family be formed, and only then can the phenomenon of mid-life divorce be avoided or reduced. Therefore, it is completely wrong for some people to call the Marriage Law the "Divorce Law." At the same time, however, freedom of divorce must also be effectively guaranteed, because only by guaranteeing freedom of divorce can both men and women be truly treated equally, respect and love each other, and live in harmony and unity. Whenever one party is abused by the other party, or the relationship deteriorates extremely, and they can no longer live together, divorce should be permitted. Such a divorce is proper, not shameful or immoral. In particular, women who request a divorce, because their marriage was arranged or forced, and they are beaten and abused after marriage, are forced to request a divorce. Such a request is reasonable and appropriate, and forcing them to continue living a painful family life is unreasonable and inappropriate. Those feudal old sayings like "a good woman doesn't marry a second husband" and "a good woman doesn't divorce, divorce is improper," are completely unreasonable. Of course, the Marriage Law protects legitimate freedom of divorce, but also opposes frivolous divorce. Therefore, the Marriage Law stipulates that when one party requests a divorce, the district people's government must first conduct mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, it is transferred to the county or city people's court for handling. The county or city people's court should also first conduct mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, a judgment is made. If there are legitimate reasons and it is indeed impossible to continue the marital relationship, divorce should be permitted. Otherwise, divorce may not be permitted. After the divorce, if both parties voluntarily resume marriage, the government does not impose restrictions and allows them to register to restore the marital relationship.

(2) The second basic principle of the Marriage Law is to abolish the feudal marriage system of male supremacy (valuing men over women) and implement a new-democratic marriage system of monogamy and equal rights for both men and women. In the old society, women did not receive equal treatment in the family. The so-called "obeying the father at home," "obeying the husband after marriage," and "obeying the son after the husband's death" were feudal rules that oppressed women and did not treat women as equal human beings. Women were subjected to this "male power" and not treated as equal human beings. Women were often treated as commodities to be bought and sold, as cattle and horses to be used, and were often beaten, abused, and even physically harmed or killed. It was precisely because of this that wealthy people had three wives and four concubines, poor people could not afford a wife, and seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girls married twelve- or thirteen-year-old children. In the family, daughters-in-law were subjected to various abuses by their parents-in-law and husbands. These unreasonable marital and family relationships arose. Moreover, there was no freedom of divorce. Therefore, marriage in the old society often caused both men and women, especially women, to suffer for life without being able to escape. Now, such feudal old rules should no longer be implemented. Now, new-democratic rules are to be implemented, which is to treat women as equal human beings, implement a system of monogamy and equal rights for both men and women, and allow freedom of divorce to ensure the implementation of this system. What is equal rights for both men and women? This is:

First, husband and wife have equal status in the family.

Second, husband and wife should love and respect each other, help each other, support each other, and live in harmony and unity, and jointly assume the responsibility of labor production and raising children.

Third, both husband and wife have the freedom to choose occupations, participate in work, and participate in social activities.

Fourth, both husband and wife have equal ownership and disposal rights over family property.

Fifth, husband and wife have the right to use their own names.

Sixth, husband and wife have the right to inherit each other's property.

To recognize equal rights for both men and women is to recognize that women have the same talents and contributions as men in all aspects of family life and social life. The view that women should be inferior to men is wrong.

(3) The third basic principle of the Marriage Law is to abolish the feudal marriage system of disregarding the interests of children and implement a new-democratic marriage system of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children. In the old society, parents did not treat children as future members of society, but as private property that parents could dispose of at will. Their interests were disregarded. Many children were abused or abandoned. Parents could arbitrarily drown or abandon infants (especially female infants). Children born out of wedlock (illegitimate children) or children born to a former husband or wife were often discriminated against and abused. Adopted children were also often discriminated against and abused. Now, such feudal old rules should no longer be implemented. Now, new-democratic rules are to be implemented, which is to protect the interests of children and protect the next generation of the new society: First, parents have the obligation to raise and educate their children, and must not abuse or abandon them, and infanticide and other criminal acts are strictly prohibited. Second, children born out of wedlock enjoy the same rights as children born in wedlock, and no one may harm or discriminate against them. Third, a husband must not abuse or discriminate against children raised by his wife who were born to her former husband, or a wife must not abuse or discriminate against children raised by her husband who were born to his former wife. Fourth, adopted children also have the same rights as biological children and must not be abused or discriminated against. Fifth, parents and children have the right to inherit each other's property. Sixth, the blood relationship between parents and children does not disappear due to divorce, and parents still have the responsibility to raise and educate their children after divorce. If the children are raised by the woman, the man should bear all or part of the necessary living expenses. The implementation of these measures will enable our future generations to be protected by the state and grow up well.

In addition to protecting the interests of children, the Marriage Law also stipulates that the legitimate rights and interests of women should be protected. This is because, although the People's Government has legally guaranteed women completely equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life, due to the influence of the feudal marriage system and feudal residual ideas, many women have not yet fully obtained these rights in practice. Therefore, if special protection is not given, equality between men and women cannot be truly achieved. In order to protect the interests of women, the Marriage Law not only guarantees freedom of marriage and guarantees that women enjoy equal rights with men, but also guarantees that women have certain property rights in the family and after divorce.

(4) The Marriage Law prohibits feudal malpractices such as bigamy, concubinage, raising child brides, interfering with the marriage freedom of widows, and extorting property by taking advantage of marriage issues. These customs all stem from the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male supremacy, and disregard for the interests of children. They are barbaric and inhumane and must be prohibited. This means that bigamy, concubinage, raising child brides, interfering with the marriage freedom of widows, and extorting property by taking advantage of marriage issues are no longer allowed. Anyone who engages in these behaviors is acting illegally.

II. What are the Benefits of Implementing the Marriage Law?

The implementation of the new-democratic marriage system is of great benefit to men, women, young, and old in every family, to future generations, to the working people, and to the entire society and country.

(1) The implementation of the Marriage Law means breaking the feudal shackles that have been placed on women for thousands of years, liberating women. Therefore, the implementation of the Marriage Law is of great benefit to the vast number of women.

(2) The implementation of the Marriage Law is also of great benefit to men. Because: The old feudal arranged marriage system not only bound women, but also bound men, especially young men, preventing them from obtaining a suitable spouse. After the implementation of the Marriage Law, this bondage can be broken, and they can freely choose their desired spouse. As long as the other party agrees, they can marry without spending money, and the husband and wife can work together to produce, so that the entire family life can be greatly improved. Therefore, it is completely wrong for some people to say that "the Marriage Law is a law for women" and "an unequal treaty for men."

(3) The implementation of the Marriage Law is also of great benefit to parents and parents-in-law. Because: First, the Marriage Law clearly stipulates that "children have the obligation to support and assist their parents; neither party shall abuse or abandon them." Therefore, the greatest interests of parents and parents-in-law are effectively protected. Second, after the implementation of marriage determined by the children themselves, parents do not have to worry about their children's marriage problems and do not have to spend money on their children's marriage problems. Third, since the children's marriage is a free union, their relationship as husband and wife will be good, and their feelings for their parents and parents-in-law will also be good. Conversely, if things are handled according to the old feudal rules, not only will parents have to worry about their children's marriage problems and spend money, but after marriage, it will often lead to discord between husband and wife, family disharmony, inability to unite in labor production, and even tragic deaths. This not only harms the children, but also harms the parents, causing permanent and unrecoverable losses.

(4) The implementation of the Marriage Law is of great benefit to protecting future generations. The Marriage Law opposes early marriage, prohibits child brides, stipulates that parents have a joint responsibility to raise their children, prohibits infanticide, prohibits parents from abusing or abandoning their children, and guarantees that children can still receive support and education after their parents' divorce. These are all to protect the interests of children. At the same time, only after the Marriage Law is implemented, in the new family of democracy, harmony, and united production, can children be well educated and become a healthy generation of builders of the new society.

(5) The implementation of the Marriage Law is of great benefit to the working people. Only the new-democratic marriage system is a marriage system that conforms to the vital interests of the working people. Because: First, according to the old arranged and buying-and-selling marriage system, marrying a wife (marriage) required paying a "bride price." The poorer the family, the higher the "bride price" demanded by the woman and the matchmaker, which often became the cause of bankruptcy for the working people. Therefore, the old marriage system was one of the biggest shackles binding the working people. But under the new marriage system, marriage does not cost money, and the working people will not go bankrupt or have their lives decline because of marriage problems. Second, the old marriage system is the root cause of many husband-wife discords, family disharmony, and affected production, which is extremely detrimental to the working people. The new marriage system can enable men and women to love and respect each other, help each other, support each other after marriage, and on the basis of harmony and unity, jointly assume the responsibility of labor production and raising children, making family life full of happiness and joy, and therefore conforming to the interests of the working people. Third, in the new society, everyone values labor and regards labor as the most sacred thing, and the Marriage Law also stipulates that husband and wife have the obligation to live in harmony and unity and engage in labor production. Therefore, when young women choose a partner, they will regard good labor as the first and most important condition. The working people can work and are not afraid of not being able to get married. In short, the new-democratic marriage system is a marriage system that conforms to the interests of the working people. Some people say: "The Marriage Law is targeting poor people!" "Implementing the Marriage Law will lead to loss of both people and wealth." These words are not right.

(6) The implementation of the Marriage Law is of great benefit to the entire society and country. Because: The implementation of the Marriage Law can liberate women, who account for half of the population, and enable them to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production, promoting the large-scale construction of industry and agriculture. At the same time, the implementation of the Marriage Law can make the people within, especially the people within men and women, more united, and everyone will work together to build a new China. Therefore, it is completely wrong for some people to say that the implementation of the Marriage Law will lead to "great chaos in the world."

III. How to Implement the Marriage Law

(1) The old marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male supremacy, and disregard for the interests of children was originally implemented by the feudal class to rule and oppress the people. This system has been implemented for thousands of years and has had a profound impact on the people, becoming a common habit of the people. Therefore, although the implementation of the Marriage Law is also an anti-feudal social reform, it is different from land reform and other social reforms. It does not aim to overthrow anyone, but mainly to change the people's own old ideas and old habits, which is entirely a matter within the people. Therefore, the implementation of the Marriage Law should adopt the policy of education, use democratic and persuasive methods to thoroughly explain the disadvantages of the old marriage system and the advantages of the new marriage system, and clearly distinguish the ideological boundaries between feudalism and new democracy. It is necessary to use the method of self-education and self-transformation of the people to change the feudal old ideas and old habits that exist among them and establish new-democratic new ideas and new habits. That is to say, the implementation of the Marriage Law must not adopt a crude and impatient attitude and the method of class struggle. If this method is adopted and the method of treating the enemy is used to treat the people themselves, it is completely wrong and impermissible. At the same time, since feudal ideas and feudal habits on marriage relations are deeply rooted things that have existed in people's minds for thousands of years and involve every individual within the people, they cannot be "eliminated" by one or two sudden campaigns. Rather, it requires long-term education and the long-term struggle of young men and women to fight for freedom of marriage to eliminate them. Therefore, this campaign is mainly to conduct a general education on the Marriage Law to the broad masses of the people, so that they can distinguish right from wrong and good from bad in the marriage system, commend exemplary couples and exemplary families who have independent marriage, family harmony, active production, and political progress, and criticize various erroneous ideas and erroneous behaviors that violate the Marriage Law. That is to say, for the broad masses of the people, this campaign should be limited to propaganda and education, without conducting investigations into family relations and gender relations, nor launching grievance campaigns, or holding struggle meetings. The practices of conducting so-called "standing in line" on family relations and gender relations, dividing so-called "fronts" between couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, launching "confessions," holding "struggle meetings," and conducting "family-by-family comparisons" are all wrong and impermissible.

(2) But until now, the phenomenon of young men and women, especially young women, being abused to death or forced to commit suicide due to marriage problems is still very serious in many places. The number of people who die each year for this reason is around 70,000 to 80,000 nationwide. This is one of the biggest evils of the feudal arranged and forced marriage system. In order to stop this serious phenomenon of killing or forcing people to death on marriage issues, it is necessary to educate all state cadres and active elements among the masses, and when implementing the Marriage Law, they must pay special attention to preventing abuse and preventing suicide, and to guarantee the personal freedom of women. For the very few serious criminals among the people who abuse women and interfere with freedom of marriage, causing serious consequences that lead to death, injury, or murder, people's courts at all levels and all cadres must take the initiative to check and handle them, and punish them according to law.

We want to warn those who are deeply poisoned by feudal ideas not to persecute any young men and women, especially women, who are fighting for freedom of marriage. Whether women are married or unmarried, whether they are satisfied with their husbands and parents-in-law, whether they are seeking a divorce, or whether they have any shortcomings, their lives and bodies must be protected equally, and absolutely no one is allowed to kill or harm them. Anyone who kills or harms women is committing a crime and must be punished by the government. Whoever kills someone must pay with their life. We also want to tell women who may encounter persecution, be in danger of life, or attempt suicide because of fighting for freedom of marriage that they should not yield and should not have thoughts of suicide, because the broad masses of the people sympathize with them and the People's Government supports them. No matter what difficulties they have, the People's Government will provide them with necessary relief and temporary settlement when they make a request.

(3) How should past arranged and forced marriages be treated? Should they be divorced? No, this should not be done. Because the implementation of the Marriage Law is not to advocate divorce, nor is it to dismantle the family relationships established by the old marriage system. Even if their past marriages do not comply with the provisions of the Marriage Law, as long as the parties do not make a firm request for divorce, no one should interfere with them or force them to divorce. However, for families that are not democratic or harmonious, they should be persuaded and helped to improve their relationship as husband and wife and the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and on this basis, establish a new-style family that is democratic, harmonious, and united in production. Only those very few couples whose relationship is really so bad that they cannot live together, or women who are subjected to inhuman abuse, and the parties make a firm request for divorce and mediation is ineffective, should be allowed to divorce, and the oppressed and abused women must be firmly supported. As for the future, parents should no longer have the behavior of arranging and forcing their children's marriages. For those who have been arranged and forced to be engaged in the past but have not yet married, parents should completely listen to their children's own decisions. If the children are still very young and their parents have arranged and forced them to be engaged, then for the sake of the children's future happiness, the engagement should be terminated as soon as possible.

How should those who have committed bigamy, taken concubines, or adopted child brides in the past be treated? This depends on whether the woman (wife or concubine) requests a divorce, and whether the child bride or her parents request that she return home. If they have such a request, they should be allowed to divorce or return home, and they must not be persecuted or interfered with. If they do not have such a request, they should still maintain a democratic and harmonious family relationship with them, and no one is allowed to force them to divorce or return home.

(4) The marriage relationship of active-duty revolutionary soldiers (including members of the People's Volunteer Army, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Armed Police) and retired revolutionary disabled soldiers and transferred revolutionary soldiers is a special issue and cannot be treated the same as the marriage relationship of ordinary cadres and the masses. They left their families, shed blood and sacrificed themselves, or were injured and disabled for the sake of defending the interests of the country and the people. They are the most glorious and most lovable people and should be given the greatest concern and respect by all of our people and their spouses. Their marriage relationship should be specially protected and not allowed to be destroyed by anyone. Otherwise, it will affect our revolutionary army and prevent them from concentrating on fighting the enemy, which is extremely detrimental to the country and the people. This patriotic principle should be made clear to everyone, especially to the families of revolutionary soldiers.

Divorce requests filed by the spouses of active-duty revolutionary soldiers should be handled with caution. If the revolutionary soldier has communication with the family, or if the revolutionary soldier is unable to communicate with the family for more than two years due to being in combat or other special circumstances, the spouse should be persuaded to withdraw the divorce request for the sake of the highest interests of the country and the people. Otherwise, the people's court should not approve it. Divorce should only be permitted if the revolutionary soldier himself actually agrees to the divorce.

When the spouses of retired revolutionary disabled soldiers or transferred revolutionary soldiers file a divorce request, the people's court should also strictly examine the reasons for their divorce request. If the reasons are not justified, they should be persuaded to withdraw the divorce request, or if the persuasion is ineffective, their divorce request should be rejected. A divorce should only be ruled if the retired disabled revolutionary soldier or transferred revolutionary soldier actually abuses his spouse and does not correct the behavior after persuasion, or if the retired disabled soldier is abused by his spouse and a serious danger may occur.

    贯彻婚姻法宣传提纲
    中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会
    一、婚姻法的基本精神是什么
    中华人民共和国婚姻法的基本精神，就是婚姻法第一条和第二条所规定的内容：“废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建主义的婚姻制度。实行男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。”“禁止重婚、纳妾。禁止童养媳。禁止干涉寡妇婚姻自由。禁止任何人借婚姻关系问题索取财物。”
    （一）婚姻法的第一个基本原则就是废除包办强迫婚姻，实行男女婚姻自由。在旧社会里，青年男女的婚姻大事，是受父母包办或强迫的，因而是不自由的。现在再不应实行这样的封建老规矩了。现在要实行新民主主义的新规矩，就是“结婚须男女双方本人完全自愿，不许任何一方对他方加以强迫或任何第三者加以干涉。”这就是说：应该让子女自己去决定他们自己的婚姻大事，让他们自由选择自己所中意的对象，并根据双方自愿由双方自己到政府去登记申请结婚。当然，青年男女结婚可以而且应该征求父母的意见，也可以征求其他的人的意见。父母给子女介绍结婚对象，也是可以的。但子女如不同意这个对象，完全可以拒绝父母之命，而子女自己中意的对象，父母如不同意，子女也完全可以不听父母之命而自行结婚。照一般道理讲，父母当然愿意替自己子女找到合意的对象，但父母的见解、性情与动机和子女不一定相同，父母认为好的，子女不一定合意，所以，婚姻应由子女自己作主，而不应由父母作主，这是完全合理的、应该的。
    所谓婚姻自由，包括结婚自由和离婚自由两方面。缺乏任何一面就不能实现真正的婚姻自由。结婚自由是主要的，因为只有实行了结婚自由，只有结婚的双方都是出于完全自愿，才能组成民主和睦、团结生产的家庭，也才能避免或减少中途离婚的现象。所以，有些人把婚姻法叫做“离婚法”是完全错误的。但同时，离婚自由也必须得到切实的保障，因为只有保障了离婚自由，才能使男女双方真正平等对待，互敬互爱，和睦团结。凡是一方受到他方虐待，或感情极端恶化，再也不能共同生活下去的时候，是应该准许离婚的。这种离婚是正当的，并不是可耻的和不道德的事。特别是要求离婚的妇女，她们因为婚姻被包办、强迫与婚后被打骂虐待而迫不得已提出离婚要求，这种要求是合情合理的，强迫她们继续过痛苦的家庭生活才是不合情又不合理的。那种什么“好女不嫁二夫”、“好女不离婚，离婚不正经”等等封建老话，是毫无道理的。当然，婚姻法保护正当的离婚自由，也反对轻率的离婚，所以婚姻法规定一方要求离婚时，得由区人民政府首先进行调解，调解无效时再转县或市人民法院处理。而县或市人民法院也应首先进行调解，如调解无效时，再行判决，有正当理由，确实不能继续夫妻关系的，应准许离婚，否则也可以不准离婚。离婚后，双方自愿恢复结婚时，政府也不加限制，准许登记恢复婚姻关系。
    （二）婚姻法的第二个基本原则，就是废除男尊女卑（重男轻女）的封建婚姻制度，实行一夫一妻、男女权利平等的新民主主义婚姻制度。在旧社会里，妇女在家庭中得不到平等待遇，所谓“在家从父”“出嫁从夫”“夫死从子”，这种封建规矩就是压迫妇女，不把妇女当作平等的人看待。妇女受了这种“男权”的支配，不被当作平等的人看待，妇女就常常被当做货物一样买卖，被当做牛马一样使唤，并且常常被打骂，甚至身体被伤害，生命被杀害。正是因为这样，有钱人三妻四妾，穷苦人讨不起老婆，十七八岁姑娘嫁给十二三岁儿童，在家庭里媳妇受到翁姑和丈夫的种种虐待，这些不合理的婚姻关系和家庭关系就产生了出来。而且到了这种地步也没有离婚自由，因此，旧社会的婚姻常常使男女双方，特别使妇女痛苦一辈子，不能解脱。现在再不应实行这样的封建老规矩了。现在要实行新民主主义的新规矩，就是要把妇女当作平等的人看待，实行一夫一妻、男女权利平等的制度，并且允许离婚自由，以保证这种制度的实行。什么是男女权利平等呢？这就是：
    第一，夫妻在家庭中地位平等。
    第二，夫妻要互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结，共同负起劳动生产、抚育子女的责任。
    第三，夫妻双方均有选择职业、参加工作和参加社会活动的自由。
    第四，夫妻双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权和处理权。
    第五，夫妻有各用自己姓名的权利。
    第六，夫妻有互相继承遗产的权利。
    承认男女权利平等，就是承认妇女在家庭生活和社会生活各方面有与男子同等的才能和贡献，那种认为女子应比男子低一等的看法是错误的。
    （三）婚姻法的第三个基本原则，就是废除漠视子女利益的封建婚姻制度，实行保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。在旧社会里，父母不把子女当作社会未来的成员看待，而把他们当作私有物，父母可以任意处置。他们的利益是受到漠视的。许多子女受到虐待或遗弃，父母可以任意溺死或抛弃婴儿（尤其是女婴）非婚生（私生）子女或前夫、前妻所生的子女往往受到歧视和虐待，养子养女也往往受到歧视和虐待。现在再不应实行这样的封建老规矩了。现在要实行新民主主义的新规矩，这就是要保护子女的利益，要保护新社会的后一代：第一、父母对子女有抚养教育的义务，不得虐待或遗弃，严禁溺婴等犯罪行为；第二、非婚生子女享受与婚生子女同等的权利，任何人不得加以危害或歧视；第三、夫对其妻所抚养和前夫所生的子女，或妻对其夫所抚养和前妻所生的子女，不得虐待或歧视；第四、养子养女也和亲生子女有同等权利，不得虐待或歧视；第五、父母子女有互相继承财产的权利；第六、父母和子女的血亲关系不因离婚而消灭，离婚后父母对其子女仍有抚养和教育的责任。如子女由女方抚养，男方应负担必需生活费的全部或一部。实行了这些办法，就能使我们的后代受到国家的保护而很好地成长起来。
    除保护子女的利益以外，婚姻法还规定要保护妇女的合法利益，这是因为人民政府虽然在法律上保证了妇女在政治上、经济上、文化教育上以及社会生活各方面与男子完全平等的权利，但是由于封建婚姻制度和封建残余思想的影响，目前许多妇女在实际上还没有完全取得这些权利，所以如果不加以特别保护，就不能真正实现男女平等。为了保护妇女的利益，婚姻法不但保障婚姻自由，保障妇女和男子享有平等权利，而且保障妇女在家庭中以及在离婚后有一定的财产权。
    （四）婚姻法禁止重婚、纳妾、养童养媳、干涉寡妇的婚姻自由以及借婚姻关系问题索取财物等封建恶习。这些习惯都是由封建的包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的婚姻制度产生出来的，是野蛮的、不人道的，必须禁止。这就是说：今后再不准许重婚、纳妾、养童养媳、干涉寡妇婚姻自由以及借婚姻关系问题索取财物了。如再有这些行为就是非法了。 
    二、实行婚姻法有什么好处
    实行新民主主义的婚姻制度，对于每个家庭的男女老少，对于子孙后代，对于劳动人民，对于整个社会国家都有极大的好处。
    （一）实行婚姻法，就是打破几千年来加在妇女身上的封建束缚，使妇女得到解放。所以，实行婚姻法对于广大妇女当然是有极大好处的。
    （二）实行婚姻法，对于男人也有极大好处。因为：旧的封建包办的婚姻制度不但束缚了妇女，同时也束缚了男子尤其是年青的男子，使他们得不到合意的配偶。婚姻法实行后，就可以打破这种束缚，他们可以自由地去选择自己合意的配偶，只要对方同意，就可以不费钱而结婚，夫妻一起劳动生产，这样，整个家庭生活也可以得到更大的改善。所以有些人说什么“婚姻法是妇女法”，“是对男子的不平等条约”，是完全不对的。
    （三）实行婚姻法，对于父母、公婆也是有很大好处的。因为：第一、婚姻法明文规定“子女对于父母有赡养扶助的义务；双方均不得虐待或遗弃”，所以父母和公婆的最大利益是受到切实保护的。第二、实行婚姻由子女自主决定之后，做父母的就可以不要为子女的婚姻问题去白操心，也不必为子女的婚姻问题破费金钱了。第三、子女的婚姻既然是自由结合的，所以他们夫妻间的感情就会好，对父母、公婆的感情也会好。相反地，如果按封建的老规矩办事，不但父母要为子女的婚姻问题操心而又破费金钱，而且在结婚后，往往造成子女的夫妻反目，家庭不和，不能团结一致劳动生产，甚至造成人命惨案，这不但害了子女，也害了父母，造成永远不能补偿的损失。
    （四）实行婚姻法，对于保护后代子孙，有很大的好处。婚姻法反对早婚，禁止童养媳，规定父母有共同抚育子女的责任，禁止溺婴，禁止父母虐待或遗弃子女，保障子女在父母离婚后仍能受到抚养和教育，这些都是保护子女的利益的。同时，只有在执行婚姻法之后，在民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭中，才能够使子女受到良好教育而成为建设新社会的身心健康的后代。
    （五）实行婚姻法，对于劳动人民有极大的好处。唯有新民主主义的婚姻制度，才是符合劳动人民切身利益的婚姻制度。因为：第一、按照旧的包办买卖的婚姻制度，娶老婆（结婚）是要出“身价钱”的，家境越贫穷，女方和媒人索取“身价”就越高，这往往就成为劳动人民破产的原因。所以旧婚姻制度，就是束缚劳动人民的最大枷锁之一。但是在新婚姻制度下，结婚是不要花钱的，劳动人民不会因为婚姻问题而弄到破产或生活下降的境地。第二、旧的婚姻制度是许多夫妻反目、家庭不和并使生产受到影响的根源，这是对劳动人民极不利的。而新婚姻制度，则可以使男女在结婚后互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养，在和睦团结基础上，共同负起劳动生产和抚育子女的责任，使家庭生活充满幸福和快乐，因而是符合劳动人民的利益的。第三、在新社会里，大家都重视劳动，把劳动看作是最神圣的事，而且婚姻法也规定夫妻有和睦团结、劳动生产的义务，所以青年妇女选择对象时，就会把劳动好看作是第一个最重要的条件。劳动人民能劳动，就不怕结不了婚。总之，新民主主义的婚姻制度是符合劳动人民利益的婚姻制度。有些人说：“婚姻法是整穷人的！”“实行婚姻法，会人财两空。”这些话都是不对的。
    （六）实行婚姻法，对于整个社会国家有极大好处。因为：实行婚姻法，可以解放占人口半数的妇女，使他们积极参加工农业生产，推进工农业的大规模建设。同时，实行婚姻法，可以使人民内部，尤其是男女人民内部更加团结，大家协力同心建设新中国。所以，有些人说：实行婚姻法，“天下要大乱”，这是完全不对的。
    三、如何贯彻婚姻法
    （一）过去的包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的婚姻制度，本是封建阶级为了统治和压迫人民而施行的。这种制度已经实行了几千年，在人民中造成了很深的影响，成了人民的共同习惯。所以贯彻婚姻法虽然也是反封建的社会改革，但是它和土地改革及其他社会改革不同，不是要打倒什么人，而主要是改变人民自己的旧思想旧习惯，这完全是人民内部的事情。因此，贯彻婚姻法，就要采取教育的方针，要用民主的说服的办法，把旧婚姻制度的坏处和新婚姻制度的好处彻底讲清楚，把封建主义和新民主主义的思想界限分清楚；要用人民群众自我教育自我改造的办法，改变存在他们中间的封建主义的旧思想旧习惯，树立新民主主义的新思想新习惯。这也就是说，贯彻婚姻法，决不能采取粗暴急躁的态度和阶级斗争的办法，如果采取这种办法，把对待敌人的办法用来对待人民自己，那就是完全错误的，不许可的。同时，婚姻关系上的封建思想和封建习惯，既然是几千年来存在于人们思想意识中的根深蒂固的东西，并且牵涉到人民内部的每一个人，那也就不是一两次突击运动就能够把它“消除”的，而是要经过长期的教育，经过青年男女争取婚姻自由的长期斗争才能把它清除。因此，这次运动主要是对广大人民群众进行一次普遍的有关婚姻法的教育，使他们在婚姻制度上能够辨别是非、分清好坏，表扬婚姻自主、家庭和睦、生产积极、政治进步的模范夫妇和模范家庭，批判违反婚姻法的种种错误思想和错误行为。这就是说，对于广大人民群众，这次运动应以宣传教育为限，不要进行家庭关系和男女关系的调查，也不要发动诉苦运动，或召开斗争会。那种对家庭关系和男女关系进行所谓“站队”，在夫妇、婆媳之间划分所谓“阵线”，发动“坦白”，召开“斗争会”，进行
    “家家评比”，这些作法都是错误的，不许可的。
    （二）但直到现在，青年男女尤其是青年妇女因婚姻问题被虐杀或被逼自杀的现象在许多地方还很严重，全国每年因此而死的人在七八万人左右。这是封建主义的包办强迫婚姻制度的最大的恶果之一。为了把这种在婚姻问题上发生的杀死人或逼死人的严重现象停止下来，必须教育全体国家干部和群众中的积极分子，在贯彻执行婚姻法时，要特别注意制止虐杀，防止自杀，保障妇女的人身自由。对于人民群众中那些极少数虐待妇女以及干涉婚姻自由而造成严重恶果以致逼死人、杀死人、打伤人的严重犯罪分子，各级人民法院及所有干部一定要主动地检查处理，依法惩办。
    我们要警告那些受封建思想毒害很深的人，不得向争取婚姻自由的青年男女特别是妇女进行任何的迫害。妇女无论已婚未婚，无论与丈夫、公婆是否互相满意，无论是否要求离婚，无论有什么缺点，她们的生命和身体必须一律受到保护，绝对不许任何人加以杀害或伤害；谁要是杀害或伤害了妇女，谁就是犯了法，谁就一定要受到政府的惩办。谁杀了人就要抵命。我们还要告诉那些可能因为争取婚姻自由而遇到迫害，有生命危险，或可能被逼而企图自杀的妇女，她们不应该屈服，更不应该有自杀的念头，因为广大人民是同情她们的，人民政府是支持她们的。无论她们有什么困难，在她们提出要求时人民政府会给她们以必要救济和临时安置。
    （三）过去包办强迫的婚姻，要怎样对待呢？是不是要他们离婚呢？不，不应该这样做。因为实行婚姻法并不是要提倡离婚，并不是要拆散由旧婚姻制度建立起来的家庭关系，他们过去的婚姻即使不合婚姻法规定，只要当事人不提出离婚的坚决要求，谁也不应当去干涉他们，强迫他们离婚。但是，不民主不和睦的家庭，应当解劝和帮助他们改善夫妻关系和婆媳关系，并在这个基础上来建立民主和睦、团结生产的新式家庭。只有那些极少数夫妻关系实在恶劣到不能共同生活下去的程度，或者妇女受到非人的虐待，由当事人提出离婚的坚决要求并经调解无效的，才允许他们离婚，而且必须坚决给被压迫被虐待的妇女撑腰。至于今后，做父母的就不应该再有包办强迫子女婚姻的行为。过去已包办强迫订婚，但未结婚的，做父母的也应该完全听随子女自己去决定。如果子女年纪还很小，而父母已包办强迫订婚的，则为子女未来的幸福计，应该及早解除婚约。
    过去已经重婚、纳妾，或者收养了童养媳的，应该怎样对待呢？这要看女方（妻或妾）是否要求离婚，童养媳或其父母是否要求让她回家来决定。如果她们有这样的要求，就应该准许她们离婚或回家，不准加以迫害或干涉。如果她们没有这样的要求，就仍应和她们保持民主和睦的家庭关系，旁人不准强迫她们离婚或回家。
    （四）现役革命军人（包括人民志愿军、人民解放军和人民公安部队的成员）和退役革命残废军人、转业革命军人的婚姻关系问题，是一个特殊的问题，不能同一般干部和群众的婚姻关系问题同样处理。他们是为了保卫国家和人民的利益而离开自己的家庭，而流血牺牲，或因此而负伤残废的。他们是最光荣和最可爱的人，应该受到我们全体人民和他们配偶的最大关心和敬爱。他们的婚姻关系应该受到特别的保护，而不允许任何人加以破坏。否则，就会影响到我们的革命军队，使他们不能安心对敌作战，这对于国家和人民是极为不利的。这个爱国主义的道理，应该向大家讲清楚，特别是向革命军人的家属讲清楚。
    对于现役革命军人配偶提出的离婚要求，应该慎重处理。凡是革命军人与家庭有通讯关系，或因革命军人处于作战或其他特殊环境而不能与家庭通讯虽有两年以上时间，都应该说服其配偶为了国家和人民的最高利益撤回离婚要求。否则，人民法庭就不应批准。只有在革命军人本人确实同意离婚时，才可准许离婚。
    退役革命残废军人或转业革命军人配偶提出离婚要求时，人民法院也应该严格审查她们要求离婚的理由，如果理由不正当，应该说服她们撤回离婚要求，或于说服无效后驳回其离婚要求。只在退役残废革命军人或转业革命军人确实虐待其配偶，经过说服也不改正；或者退役残废军人受到其配偶的虐待并可能发生严重危险时，才应判决离婚。
