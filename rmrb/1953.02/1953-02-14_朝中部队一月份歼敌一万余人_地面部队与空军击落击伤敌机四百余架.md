Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 13th: In January, the coldest month of the year in Korea, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fought bravely on the bitterly cold, ice- and snow-covered mountains and achieved new victories. Throughout the month, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies engaged the enemy in 169 battles (including 117 ambush and blocking actions), annihilating a total of 11,936 enemy soldiers.

Comparing the combat situation in January of this year with that of January last year, we can see how significant the changes in the Korean War have been over the past year. Last January, the enemy was still quite rampant, but now they have become so timid and vulnerable. Around the New Year last year, the American aggressors, while wantonly delaying the armistice negotiations, clamored for the use of "military pressure" and launched a provocative offensive against our army's positions in the Jiryeong-dong area near Panmunjom for twelve days, only to stop after suffering heavy losses. This January—the second month since the end of the Battle of Triangle Hill—the American aggressors, unwilling to accept defeat, launched a "sudden attack" against Cheolsan Northwest, Seongsan, and Jisan-dong area (called T-Bone Hill by the enemy) after thorough preparation. However, this offensive was far less effective than the offensive around the New Year last year; it was completely defeated by our army in just eight hours.

The victories achieved by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in January demonstrate that our army can carry out courageous offensive operations not only in the autumn but also during the coldest time of winter. In January, our army's night raiding teams were particularly active. Entire enemy platoons and squads were annihilated by our army, as well as large portions of three companies and four platoons. On the nights of the 8th and 11th, in three major ambush operations carried out by our army near Jangseung-ri and Sapyeong-ri, between Gimseong and Goseong on the eastern front, large portions of three companies of the Rhee Syngman army's 11th and 12th Divisions were annihilated, totaling more than 450 enemy soldiers. These ambush operations were characterized by quick resolution of combat and few casualties on our side. In the ambush operation near Little Magpie Peak east of Sapyeong-ri, our army took only twenty minutes to completely occupy the enemy's position, annihilating 118 enemy soldiers while sacrificing only two of our own, resulting in a casualty ratio of fifty-nine to one. Our army's ambush operations made the enemy, hiding in their cold bunkers, feel uneasy night after night, fearing that our raiding teams would suddenly appear before them and deliver an irresistible blow.

The Korean and Chinese People's Armies defending the front lines thwarted numerous enemy incursions in January. On the western and central fronts, the enemy launched nine major incursions, but each incursion was repelled within a short period of time. The more troops the enemy used for incursions, the heavier their casualties became. In the latter half of the month, the enemy used a battalion-sized force in two incursions. One was an incursion against a hill north of the Suyu-ri area northwest of Liancheon. The enemy attacked continuously from 7:00 a.m. to noon on the 23rd, launching seven consecutive assaults, suffering more than 150 casualties before retreating in defeat. The other was on the morning of the 25th, when the enemy launched what they called the largest "assault" since the beginning of winter against "T-Bone Hill." Two companies on the central route launched three assaults against one of our army's forward positions but were repelled each time. By about 3:00 p.m., the enemy released smoke screens to cover their retreat and the dragging away of wounded and dead soldiers—the so-called thoroughly prepared "assault" was thus declared a failure in such a short time.

Enemy aircraft were more active this month in the rear and front lines of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies than before, with an average of more than 430 enemy aircraft appearing in the front lines every day, and more than 700 aircraft on the busiest day. However, under the attack of the anti-aircraft shooting campaign launched by our army's front-line units, enemy aircraft also suffered heavy losses. In twenty days, our army on the central front shot down 28 enemy aircraft and damaged 28 enemy aircraft, more than half of which were shot down or damaged by heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and rifles. Our army's sniper movement at the front was also quite active. According to incomplete statistics, in January, our army's mobile artillery fire killed or wounded a total of 3,956 enemy soldiers; snipers shot and wounded 2,582 enemy soldiers.

This January, the American aggressors tried their best to expand the Rhee Syngman army, indiscriminately bombed peaceful towns and villages in North Korea, and constantly shelled Wonsan. Collins, Clark, Van Fleet, and others hurriedly "inspected" the front lines. This series of events shows that the American aggressors, who have always been intent on undermining the armistice negotiations, are gradually implementing a new military adventure plan. However, the American aggressors' inevitable defeat cannot be reversed. If the American aggressors dare to expand the war of aggression, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

The achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in January are as follows (incomplete statistics):

I. A total of 11,936 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 3,988 American soldiers, 484 British soldiers, 31 Turkish soldiers, and 7,433 Rhee Syngman soldiers.

II. Major captured items: 6 flamethrowers, 2 rocket launchers, 60 light and heavy machine guns, 471 guns of various types, 2 radio stations, and 30 communication devices of various types.

III. Ground forces and air force units shot down or damaged a total of 408 enemy aircraft (171 shot down, 237 damaged). 63 enemy tanks were destroyed or damaged. 49 enemy artillery pieces of various types were destroyed or damaged. 121 enemy vehicles were destroyed or damaged.

### 朝中部队一月份歼敌一万余人  地面部队与空军击落击伤敌机四百余架

    朝中部队一月份歼敌一万余人
    地面部队与空军击落击伤敌机四百余架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】在今年一月这个朝鲜最寒冷的月份里，朝中人民军队在寒风凛冽、冰雪封冻的山岭上英勇战斗，取得了新的胜利。朝中人民军队全月与敌作战一百六十九次（其中一百十七次是袭击战和阻击战），共计歼灭敌人一万一千九百三十六名。
    我们如果拿今年一月份的战况与去年一月份的战况作比较，可以看出一年来朝鲜战争发生了多么重大的变化。去年一月份敌人还相当的猖狂，如今却变得那么胆小和脆弱。去年新年前后，美国侵略者一面肆意拖延停战谈判，一面叫嚣使用“军事压力”，向板门店附近智陵洞地区的我军阵地进行了十二天挑衅进攻，遭到重大损失后才停止。而今年一月——上甘岭战役结束以来的第二个月，不甘心于失败的美国侵略者又向铁原西北城山、芝山洞地区（敌人称为丁字山）发动了一次经过充分准备的“突击战”。可是这次进攻大大不如去年新年前后的进攻，只打了八个小时，就被我军完全打败了。
    朝中人民军队在一月份中所取得的胜利，说明我军不仅在秋季，即使在冬季最寒冷的时候，也同样能够进行英勇的出击战。在一月份中，我军的夜袭队格外活跃，被我军成建制地歼灭的敌人就有十个排和十二个班的全部、三个连和四个排的大部。八日和十一日夜里，我军在东线金城到高城之间的长承里、沙飞里附近进行的三次较大的袭击战，即歼灭李伪军第十一师和第十二师的三个连的大部，共四百五十多名。这些袭击战的特点是：解决战斗快、我军伤亡少。在沙飞里以东小鹊峰附近的袭击战，我军仅仅费了二十分钟，就全部占领了敌人的阵地，歼敌一百十八名，自己仅牺牲二人，敌我伤亡的比例是五十九比一。我军的袭击战，使躲在冰冷地堡里的敌人夜夜惶惶不安，敌人深怕我军袭击队突然出现在他们面前，给予他们以不可抵抗的打击。
    守卫在前线的朝中人民军队在一月份中粉碎了敌人多次窜犯。在西线和中线，敌人进行了九次较大的窜犯，但每次窜犯都在短时间内被击退。敌人用作窜犯的兵力越多，伤亡就越重。这个月下旬，敌人有两次窜犯都使用了一个营的兵力，其中一次是窜犯涟川西北水郁市北山的一个高地，敌人从二十三日早晨七时一直打到中午，连续冲锋七次，伤亡一百五十多名后败退下去；另一次是二十五日早晨八时，敌人向“丁字山”发动所谓自入冬以来最大的一次“突击战”，其中路两个连向我军一个前沿阵地冲锋三次，都被击退，到下午三时许，敌人便散放烟幕，掩护部队撤退和拖运伤兵死尸——所谓有着充分准备的“突击战”便如此短促地宣告失败了。
    这个月敌机在朝中人民军队后方和前线的活动较前频繁，在前线平均每天出现敌机四百三十多架次，最多的一天达七百多架次。但敌机在我军前线部队展开的对空射击运动的打击下，也遭到了惨重的损失。中线我军在二十天中即击落敌机二十八架，击伤敌机二十八架，其中有半数以上是被高射机枪、轻重机枪和步枪击落击伤的。前线我军的狙击运动也相当活跃。据不完全统计，一月份中我军游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军三千九百五十六名；狙击手射死射伤敌军二千五百八十二名。
    今年一月，美国侵略者竭力扩充李伪军，滥炸北朝鲜和平城乡，不断炮轰元山；柯林斯、克拉克、范佛里特等匆匆“视察”前线。这一连串事件说明：一向存心破坏停战谈判的美国侵略者，正在逐步地执行着新的军事冒险计划。但是，美国侵略者必败的定局是无法挽回的了。美国侵略者如果胆敢扩大侵略战争，它必将遭到更加惨重的失败。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一月份的战果如下（不完全统计）：
    一、共歼灭敌军一万一千九百三十六名，包括美军三千九百八十八名，英军四百八十四名，土耳其军三十一名，李伪军七千四百三十三名。
    二、主要缴获：火焰喷射器六具、火箭筒二具，轻重机枪六十挺，各种枪四百七十一枝，电台二部，各种通话机三十部。
    三、地面部队与空军部队共击落击伤敌机四百零八架（击落一百七十一架，击伤二百三十七架）。击毁击伤敌军坦克六十三辆。击毁击伤敌军各种炮四十九门。击毁击伤敌军汽车一百二十一辆。
