Xinhua News Agency, January 31st dispatch: According to TASS, all parts of the Soviet Union are actively supporting the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union. Countless perfect machines, equipment, construction materials, and other resources are continuously transported to the construction sites. As the scale of work on the construction sites expands, the quantity of supplies also continues to increase. Last year, more than 500 enterprises manufactured orders for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station alone, and 40,000 freight cars of machines, equipment, construction materials, and other items were transported to this construction site from all over the country in one year. This figure will increase this year. At the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station construction site, construction workers are also being equipped with powerful machines transported from all over the country. At the construction sites of the South Ukraine Canal and the North Crimea Canal, various machines, equipment, and construction materials are transported every day. Motorcycles, electrical equipment, and machine tools are transported from Moscow; powerful bulldozers are transported from Bryansk; ditching machines are transported from Kremenchug; and tractor-propelled stone loaders are transported from Sverdlovsk. In January, a train pulling dozens of freight cars transported the components of the second self-propelled excavator with a 14-cubic-meter bucket manufactured by the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant to the construction site. In addition, the first batches of materials and equipment transported from Stavropol, Tyumen, Yerevan, Tbilisi, and other cities to the construction site have also arrived recently. The supplies transported to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station construction site have also increased greatly recently. The average monthly supply of materials transported to the construction site in the past was 500 to 700 trucks. However, in the first ten days of January 1953, 712 trucks of materials were transported. At the Turkmen Main Canal construction site, the railway laid in the Kara Kum Desert is constantly transporting machines, equipment, and supplies from Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Odessa, Siberia, and Belarus. In the young city of Takhiatash, new enterprises are opening every day.

Industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet Union are stepping up production of orders for the great communist construction projects. In Moscow, the Moscow Transformer Factory will manufacture more than 100 transformers for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station in the first quarter of this year. The electrical equipment designed by the Dinamo Factory for the Stalingrad, Kakhovka, and other hydroelectric stations will ensure the automation and remote control of sluices and other mechanical devices. In Leningrad, the Stalin Hardware Factory is manufacturing the first giant turbine for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. Its foundry is casting molds for the turbine rotor blades. This year, the Kirov "Elektrosila" Electrical Equipment Factory will manufacture the first generator for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, with a power generation capacity of over 100,000 kilowatts. This factory, famous throughout the country for its laboratory that regularly tests the latest high-voltage equipment, has already transported thousands of instruments to the great construction project sites in the Volga, Dnieper, and Turkmenistan regions ahead of schedule last year. In the Urals, the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant is a regular contractor for orders for communist construction projects. Workers at the plant also accept criticisms from machinery operators at the construction site during the manufacturing process to improve their work. For example, the famous self-propelled excavator recently transported to the South Ukraine Canal construction site has improved the productivity of the machine and shortened the time required for manufacturing due to the acceptance of such opinions. The new excavator has a 75-meter-long boom, which is 10 meters longer than the boom of the previous batch of machines. The Chelyabinsk Machine Building Plant is manufacturing a concrete conveying bracket for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. Ukrainian factories are also manufacturing various machines for the great project. Many five-ton automatic cranes have been transported from Odessa to the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction site. In 24 hours, each of these cranes can replace the work of 400 people. In Donbass, workers manufactured a giant cable for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, and it took more than 100 freight cars to transport this cable. In Belarus, the task of fulfilling orders for communist construction projects is also being stepped up.

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st dispatch: According to TASS, institutions of higher education throughout the Soviet Union that specialize in training cadres for communist construction projects have graduated a large number of experts in hydroelectric station and irrigation system construction projects, as well as land reclamation experts. The number of hydraulic engineers who recently graduated from the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineering is almost double that of 1951. Many of them volunteered to participate in the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. The first batch of students from the Kuibyshev Institute of Hydraulic Engineering has graduated. Their graduation theses are closely related to the urgent problems that need to be solved by the great construction projects, such as "Large Hydroelectric Stations on the Volga River" and "Water Conservancy Project Plan on the Kama River." Many of the young experts who recently graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Agricultural Irrigation and Mechanization have already worked on the Turkmen Main Canal construction site.

    苏联全国支援共产主义建设工程
    各高等教育机关为建设工程造就大批专家
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联全国各地积极支援伟大的苏联共产主义建设工程。无数完善的机器、设备、建筑材料和其他物资源源不绝地运到各建设工地。随着工地上工作规模的扩大，供应的数量也不断增加。去年单为古比雪夫水电站制造定货的企业就有五百多个，一年内从全国各地运到这个工地上的机器、设备、建筑材料和其他物品有四万节车皮。今年这一数字还将增加。在斯大林格勒水电站工地，建筑工人也正在用各地运来的效力强大的机器装备起来。在南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河工地上，每天都有各种机器、设备和建筑材料运来，从莫斯科运来了摩托车、电气设备和工作母机，从布利安斯克运来了效力强大的开路机，从克里门楚格运来了掘沟机，从斯维德洛夫斯克运来了由拖拉机推进的装石机。在一月份，拖拉数十节车皮的列车把乌拉尔重型机械制造厂所制造的第二部有十四公方吊斗的自动移动挖掘机的部件运到工地上来。此外，斯塔夫罗波尔、第乌门、埃里温、第比利斯等城市运往工地的第一批材料和设备也已在最近到达。运到卡霍夫卡水电站工地上的物资，最近也大大增加了。运到工地的物资过去平均每月为五百到七百卡车。而一九五三年一月份头十天中运来的物资就有七百一十二卡车。在土库曼大运河工地，敷设在卡拉·库姆大沙漠上的铁路不断地转运着从莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、敖德萨、西伯利亚和白俄罗斯运来的机器、设备和供应品。在年轻的塔赫亚·塔什城里，每天都有新的企业开工。
    苏联全国各地的工业企业都在加紧生产各伟大共产主义建设工程的定货。在莫斯科，莫斯科变压器工厂今年第一季将为古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站制造一百多个变压器。狄纳莫工厂为斯大林格勒、卡霍夫卡等水电站设计的电气设备，将保证水闸及其他机械装置的自动化和远距离操纵。在列宁格勒、斯大林五金工厂正在制造古比雪夫水电站的第一座巨型透平。它的翻砂间正在铸造透平转子叶瓣的铸模。今年基洛夫“电力”电工器材厂将为古比雪夫水电站制造第一部发电机，其发电能力将超过十万瓩。这个经常试验最新高压设备的实验室闻名全国的工厂，去年已提前把几千部仪器运往伏尔加、第聂伯和土库曼各地的伟大建设工程工地上。在乌拉尔，乌拉尔重型机械制造厂是经常承制共产主义建设工程定货的。该厂工人在制造定货过程中还接受工地机械操使者的批评意见，改进工作。例如最近运到南乌克兰运河工地去的著名的自动移动挖掘机，由于接受了这种意见，提高了机器的生产率，并缩短了制造所需的时间。这部新挖掘机有七十五公尺长的吊杆，比前一批机器的吊杆长十公尺。车里雅宾斯克机器制造厂正在为古比雪夫水电站制造一个输送混凝土的支架。乌克兰的工厂也在为伟大的工程制造各种机器。许多五吨自动起重机已从敖德萨运到了古比雪夫水电站工地。在二十四小时中，每架这种起重机可以代替四百个人工作。在顿尼兹，工人们为古比雪夫水电站制造了一条巨型电缆，运输这条电缆需要用一百多节车皮。在白俄罗斯，共产主义建设工程的定货任务也在加紧完成着。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联各地专为共产主义建设工程造就干部的高等教育机关，已有大批水电站、灌溉系统建设工程专家和土地开垦专家毕业。莫斯科建筑工程师研究所最近毕业的水利工程师几乎相当于一九五一年的两倍。其中许多人自愿参加古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站的建设工作。古比雪夫水利工程研究所的第一批学生已经毕业。他们的毕业论文都与伟大建设工程急需解决的问题有密切关系。如“伏尔加河上的大水电站”、“卡马河上水利工程计划”等等。塔什干农业灌溉与机械化研究所最近毕业的一批青年专家，有许多都已在土库曼大运河工地上工作了。
