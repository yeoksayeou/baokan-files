Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army enthusiastically launched activities to support the government and cherish the people before and after the Spring Festival.

Before the Spring Festival, the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army universally carried out education on supporting the government and cherishing the people through methods such as classes, forums, and inviting leading comrades from local people's governments, labor models, and models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers to give reports. The Political Department of the Central-South Military Region also specially invited Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Administrative Committee, Zhu Guang, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, and labor model Wang Shengbao to give reports to the troops, and recorded the reports for broadcast to the entire army. Newspapers, wired broadcasting stations, and radio stations in the various units also conducted extensive propaganda and education with supporting the government and cherishing the people as the central theme. Some units also held "Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People" picture exhibitions.

During the month of supporting the government and cherishing the people, the various units universally conducted mass discipline inspections. The various units paid special attention to the opinions of the people in various places during the discipline inspections. Many units invited local people's governments, mass organizations, and representatives from all walks of life to hold forums to solicit opinions on the army. The units of the Northeast Military Region stationed in Shenyang and Dalian, together with personnel from the local people's governments, formed several visiting groups or discipline inspection groups to go deep into the residents of various streets to solicit opinions on the troops. Many troops stationed in minority areas specially inspected the situation of respecting the customs and habits of various ethnic groups and implementing minority policies. After conducting mass discipline inspections, the various units formulated specific measures to further strengthen military-civilian relations and abide by mass discipline. Some units in the North China Military Region also formulated collective "Pacts on Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People." The people in various places unanimously praised the People's Liberation Army for its strict discipline. They cited many exemplary cases of the troops abiding by mass discipline and cherishing the people, and thanked many troops for encouraging the people to participate in various social reforms and patriotic movements, and for helping the people improve their cultural level and political awareness.

Commanders and fighters of the various units also launched a letter-writing campaign. They wrote letters to commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the people in the garrison area, and their families, reporting on their progress over the past year and their determination to defend the large-scale construction of the motherland.

During the Spring Festival, commanders and fighters of the various units warmly congratulated the people in the驻地 (zhù dì) on the Spring Festival and held get-togethers with government workers and residents. The various units of the East China Military Region also invited the people in the garrison area to visit the troop's sports performance competitions, cultural learning achievement exhibitions, and national construction picture exhibitions. The various units also sent representatives to慰问 (wèi wèn) the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and the families of state workers in the garrison area. Commanders and fighters guarding the coastal defense front lines in East China, Central-South China, and other places also held Spring Festival get-togethers with fishermen and militiamen on the islands. They mutually guaranteed that they would unite more closely, resolutely smash any enemy intrusion, and protect the people of the whole country to safely carry out large-scale national construction.
