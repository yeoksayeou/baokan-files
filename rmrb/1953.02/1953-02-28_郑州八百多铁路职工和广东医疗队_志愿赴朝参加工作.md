Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, February 27th: Another 857 workers from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration have volunteered to go to the Korean front lines to participate in transportation work. They have already left Zhengzhou in two batches on the 23rd and 26th, heading north. As they departed, they wore glorious flowers and held high dozens of banners presented to them by people from all walks of life in Zhengzhou.
