Introduction to the Amateur Cultural School of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
By Ling Yun, Director of Education, Amateur Cultural School of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

Simple Situation

The Amateur Cultural School of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was founded in January 1950. The number of students has increased from the initial dozens to about 1,500 now (including 97 section chiefs, two division chiefs, and four ministers). The classes have expanded from the initial elementary Chinese and mathematics classes and one junior high Chinese class to 37 classes covering elementary to high school Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The participating units have also expanded from a few initially to 32 now. The school has one principal (concurrently held by the Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau), one director of education, and is divided into three teaching and research groups: middle school Chinese, science and mathematics, and elementary school Chinese. The school has a total of 17 full-time teachers, three part-time teachers, and five full-time administrative staff (including one each for typing, clerical work, and mimeographing).

Main Achievements

The establishment of the机关文化学校 satisfies the cadres' urgent need for cultural learning, stabilizes their working morale, and improves their work ability. With the development of national construction, many cadres with low cultural levels felt that they were not competent for their jobs, and some asked to leave their posts to study, which undermined their commitment to their work. The establishment of the 机关文化学校 satisfied their needs. Seventy percent of the cadres at the high school level or below in the entire organization participated in learning. According to the cadres' demands, the school gradually expanded the number of classes, increased the subjects, and added grade levels. Over the years, some comrades who participated in cultural learning have been promoted from literacy classes to junior high school, and some have improved from elementary school to high school (Chinese language proficiency); those who previously only knew a few words can now write relatively fluent articles; those who initially only knew addition and subtraction have now completed elementary algebra. The work ability of these comrades has also improved along with their cultural level.

The level of understanding of the students has also improved. In their compositions, many people have linked the lessons to examine their own ideological problems and shortcomings in their work, and expressed their determination to correct them. Many people's understanding of the documents, books, and newspapers they read has also become more profound than before.

Most of the students have developed good study habits. The attendance rate often reaches over 93 percent. Several years of cultural teaching have also yielded some experience in the education of on-the-job cadres. This experience has laid the foundation for systematic cultural education work in the future.

Difficulties Encountered in Running the School and Solutions

1. The contradiction between political theory learning and cultural learning: When the 机关文化学校 was established, the leadership stipulated that comrades who did not have a junior high school graduation level must participate in cultural learning at the school and temporarily not study political theory. However, some comrades regarded studying political theory as a political privilege and felt that studying culture without studying theory lowered their status, and they were dissatisfied with this. Some people did not come to study even after being assigned to a class, and insisted on studying theory even though they could not understand it; some came to study with a confrontational attitude; and some took leave or were absent on the pretext that the classes were not assigned appropriately. Therefore, initially there were many students at the 机关学校 in name only.

To this end, the leadership repeatedly mobilized and persuaded them. They explained the importance of learning culture, pointing out that learning theory with insufficient cultural level would only achieve half the results with twice the effort, while learning culture well and then learning theory could achieve twice the results with half the effort. At the same time, the school also strictly stipulated the roll call and leave system, and those who were absent without reason were issued absence notices to urge them to attend. In this way, the attendance of students greatly improved in the second semester.

2. The contradiction between work and learning: Some comrades emphasized that they were too busy with work and did not come to participate in cultural learning; some administrative leaders of certain units did not pay attention to the cultural learning of cadres and did not guarantee the learning time of cadres, casually granting leave to students; and some arbitrarily used the class time of students to hold meetings or other activities. All of these affected classes. The solutions to these problems are: first, the leadership should emphasize that administrative leaders at all levels should attach importance to the cultural learning of cadres, and the leadership should strictly delineate the time for cultural learning (every morning and Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings) and the time for various activities (Wednesday evenings for union activities, Friday evenings for party and league activities, and Saturday evenings for recreational activities); at the same time, we should also appropriately pay attention to minimizing homework in teaching to avoid students taking up work time to study.

3. Inharmonious teacher-student relations, teachers not at ease in their work: When the 机关学校 was first established, some comrades had an incorrect view of the salaried teachers: they believed that the teachers were not participants in the revolution but were hired cultural teachers; some had a contemptuous attitude towards the teachers because the teachers' cultural level was very inconsistent with their political theory level, and some students even deliberately picked on the teachers' faults. Therefore, some teachers asked to be transferred to ordinary middle schools outside to teach. In response to this situation, the Party branch within the organization launched a campaign for Party and League members to take the lead in guaranteeing that teachers should be respected and united; on the other hand, more opportunities were given to teachers in various studies to improve their political level, and their salaries were adjusted and given appropriate care in life. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen the ideological education and ideological transformation work of teachers, improve their awareness, and strengthen their political sense of responsibility for the cultural education of on-the-job cadres.

4. Regarding the issue of examination and class placement: Some students were afraid of the entrance examination and asked to audit for a period of time before taking the examination, and some did not come to the examination time and signed up after the examination, which greatly affected the school's work plan (such as class placement, preparation of teachers, classrooms, teaching materials, etc.). Based on this situation, the school adopted a subject-based class placement method, basically assigning classes according to voluntariness and the level of each subject. Without emphasizing temporary examination results, this method dispelled the students' concerns about enrollment.

Several Experiences

1. Years of experience in the amateur cultural school for organizations have proved that on-the-job cadres can carry out systematic cultural learning, and the amateur cultural school for organizations is the best organizational form for carrying out this education. The rapid development of amateur cultural schools fully illustrates this point.

2. Leadership attention and Party and League guarantees are the key to running the school well. To run an amateur cultural school for organizations well, it is not only necessary to have a certain number of cadres and necessary funds, but also the strong support and cooperation of the leadership and the Party and League. The General Office of the Northeast Bureau made a decision on the 机关学校 in 1951 on "July 1st," which laid the foundation for the regularization of the school. Administrative leaders and Party and League branches at all levels have given great help to the 机关学校. All administrative units have established comrades responsible for leading cadres' cultural learning to lead and supervise cultural learning. This ensured the implementation and execution of the school's system and plans.

3. Establishing full-time cadres and full-time teachers is an important condition for persisting in and running the school well. Because there are dedicated people in charge, someone will be dedicated to studying how to run the amateur cultural school for organizations well, how to adapt to the characteristics of organizations to run the school, and how to streamline teaching materials and improve teaching methods to achieve the purpose of rapid success. Full-time teachers should deeply understand the students' learning situation, often give make-up lessons to students who have asked for leave, and provide individual tutoring to students with poor proficiency, so as to improve the students' learning enthusiasm. Part-time teachers often can only regard part-time teaching as an ancillary job, and it is impossible to have more time to devote to teaching work in terms of energy. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately establish full-time teachers.

4. Several organizations with close residences can jointly run schools. When the 机关学校 was first established, because there were few students, it was impossible to divide the classes too finely, so the proficiency of the students in each class was extremely uneven, which affected teaching. At the same time, the level difference between classes was also large, and students' promotion often became skipping grades, and repetition became demotion. Later, the 机关学校 absorbed more units, and the number of students greatly increased. The number of classes increased, so the proficiency of each class was relatively even, which was convenient for teaching, and it was also more economical in terms of manpower and material resources than running schools separately.

5. Necessary systems should be established. When the amateur cultural school for organizations was first established, some students did not pay attention to the school's roll call and leave system, and simply emphasized the teaching quality of the teachers, believing that "as long as the teaching is good, there will be no absences without roll call." This is wrong and will actually cause a loose and undisciplined phenomenon. Later, the school strictly stipulated the roll call and leave system, and issued absence notices when students were absent, and cooperated with the administration to commend and criticize students for their learning performance. This also played a great role in promoting learning.

6. Teaching should be carried out according to the characteristics of cadres in organizations. The knowledge of cadres in organizations is unbalanced in various subjects. At the same time, adults have the characteristics of hoping to concentrate their energy on a single subject and demanding rapid success, and they require the school to give them what they lack and urgently need. Therefore, the school should carry out teaching according to these characteristics. We have compiled a junior high school Chinese textbook with writing guidance as the center, supplemented by articles with suitable forms and content, and required this key point in lecturing and correcting homework, which has been of great help to the students' Chinese language knowledge and writing ability. The concentrated lecture method of grammar courses is also welcomed by them. We have continuously held three terms of grammar classes, and the students came very enthusiastically, with no less than five or six hundred people in each term.

Existing Problems and Hopes

In the future, the amateur cultural school for organizations needs to study how to further improve and move towards regularization. Because the responsible comrades of organizations are busy with work, it is impossible for them to specifically lead the amateur cultural school for organizations. Therefore, there is a need for a special leading organization to guide the school's business. Secondly, in terms of teaching materials, it is necessary to compile a set of teaching materials that meet the requirements of on-the-job cadres based on the characteristics of cadres in organizations. Although we are trying to compile them, we are troubled by the low level of business, insufficient experience in compiling teaching materials, and the limitation of energy and time, and there are many difficulties in specific work. All of these are hoped to be resolved as soon as possible. Finally, we hope that the leadership will convene meetings more often in the future to organize the exchange of experiences in running amateur cultural schools.

    中共中央东北局机关业余文化学校介绍
    中共中央东北局机关文化学校教务主任　凌云
    简单情况
    中共中央东北局机关文化学校于一九五○年一月创办以来，学员由最初几十人增加到现在的一千五百人左右（其中包括九十七个科长、两个处长、四个部长）。班级由最初的小学语文、数学班和一个初中语文班，扩大为现在由小学到高中的语文、数学、物理、化学等三十七个班。参加学习的单位，也由最初少数单位扩大为现在的三十二个单位。学校设校长一人（东北局秘书长兼），教务主任一人，下分中学语文、数理和小学语文三个教学研究组。全校共有专职教员十七人，兼职教员三人，专职行政干部五人（包括打字、文书、油印各一人）。
    主要成绩
    机关文化学校的建立，满足了干部迫切的文化学习要求，稳定了干部的工作情绪，提高了干部工作能力。随着国家建设的发展，许多文化水平低的干部感到不能胜任工作，有些人要求离职学习，不安心工作。机关文化学校的成立满足了他们的要求，全机关高中水平以下的干部，百分之七十都参加了学习。根据干部们的要求，学校逐步地扩大了班次，增加了学科和年级。数年来，参加文化学习的同志有的由识字班升到初中，有的从高小提到高中（国文程度）；从前只识几个字的，现在已能写比较通顺的文章了；最初只会加减法的，现在已学完了小代数。这些同志们的工作能力也随着他们的文化水平的提高而提高了。
    学员们认识水平也提高了。在作文里，不少人联系课文检讨自己的思想毛病和工作缺点，并表示自己改正的决心。许多人对所读文件、书籍、报章等的体会也较前深刻了。
    学员们大多数已养成了良好的学习习惯。学习出勤率经常达到百分之九十三以上。数年来的文化教学也找到了一些对在职干部教育的经验。这些经验给今后系统的文化教育工作打下了基础。
    办学中遇到的困难和解决的办法
    一、政治理论学习和文化学习的矛盾：机关文化学校成立时，领导方面规定了凡不够初中毕业水平的同志，必须参加机关学校学习文化，暂不学习政治理论，但有一部分同志把学习政治理论看成是政治待遇，认为学文化不学理论是降低了自己的身份，因而对此不满。有的人编了班也不来学习，啃不动理论偏要硬啃；有的人抱着对抗的情绪来参加学习；也有的人因班级编的不够合适则借故请假或旷课。因此最初机关学校挂名的学员很多。
    为此，领导方面再三进行了动员和说服。说明学文化的重要，指出文化程度不够学理论只会事倍功半，而学好文化再学理论则可收到事半功倍之效。与此同时，学校也严格规定了点名、请假制度，对那些无故旷课的，就发旷课通知书以督促其出席。这样在第二学期，学员的出席情况就大大好转。
    二、工作和学习的矛盾：有些同志自己强调工作忙，不来参加文化学习；有些是因为某些单位行政领导不重视干部的文化学习，不保证干部的学习时间，随便给学员请假；有的则随便占用学员的上课时间开会或作其他活动。这些都影响了上课。解决这些问题的办法是：首先由领导方面强调各级行政领导应重视干部的文化学习，领导方面应严格划出文化学习的时间（每日早晨及星期一、二、四的晚上）和各种活动的时间（星期三晚为工会活动时间，星期五晚为党团活动时间，星期六晚为文娱活动的时间）；同时我们也适当注意在教学方面尽量少留课外作业，使学员不占用工作时间来学习。
    三、师生关系不协调，教员不安心工作：在机关学校刚开办时，一部分同志对工薪制的教员有种不正确的看法：认为教员不是参加革命的而是被雇用的文化教员；有的因教员的文化水平与政治理论水平很不相称，因而对教员有轻视的心理，甚至有些学员专挑教员毛病。因此有些教员要求调到外边普通中学去教书。根据这种情况，机关党内就发动党团员起保证带头作用，提出应该尊敬教师，团结教员；另一方面在各种学习上给教员以更多的机会来提高教员的政治水平，在生活上调整工薪并给以适当的关照。另一方面也要加强教员的思想教育和思想改造工作，提高其觉悟，加强对在职干部文化教育的政治责任心。
    四、关于考试编班的问题：有些学员害怕入学考试，要求先旁听一个时期，以后再考试，有的考试时间不来，考试过后再报名，这样很影响学校工作的计划（如编班、准备教员、教室、教材等问题）。学校根据此种情况，采取了学科编班的方式，基本按自愿和各科水平来分别编班。不强调一时的考试成绩，这种方式打破了学员入学的顾虑。
    几点经验
    一、数年来机关业余文化学校的经验证明了在职干部是可以进行系统的文化学习的，机关业余文化学校是进行这一教育的最好的组织形式。业余文化学校之所以能如此迅速的发展也正充分说明了这一点。
    二、领导重视和党团保证是办好学校的关键。办好机关业余文化学校，不仅要有一定的干部和必要的经费，而且要领导方面和党团大力支持与配合。东北局办公厅在一九五一年“七一”作过关于机关学校的决定，给学校正规化打下了基础。各级行政领导与党团支部，都曾给机关学校很大帮助。各行政单位都设立了领导干部文化学习的负责同志，领导与督促文化学习。这样才保证了学校的制度、计划的贯彻与执行。
    三、设立专职干部和专职教员，是坚持与办好学校的重要条件。因为有了专人负责，就有人专门经常研究如何办好机关业余文化学校，如何适应机关特点来办学校，如何精简教材改进教学方法以达到速成的目的。专职教师应深入了解学员学习情况，经常给请假的学员补课，对程度较差的学员进行个别辅导，这样才能提高学员的学习积极性。兼职教员往往只能把兼课作为附带的工作，精力上也不可能有更多的时间用于教学工作上，所以，适当设立专职教员是必要的。
    四、住地靠近的几个机关可集中开办学校。在机关学校刚开办时，由于学员少，班级不可能分得过细，因此每个班学员的水平极不整齐，影响教学。同时班与班的水平相差也较大，学员升级往往变成了跳级，留级变成了降级。后来机关学校吸收的单位多了，学员的人数也大大增加。班级增多了，这样各班水平比较整齐，便于教学，而且在人力物力上也比分散开办要经济得多。
    五、应该建立必要的制度。在机关业余文化学校刚成立时，有些学员不重视学校的点名、请假制度，而单纯强调教员的教学质量，认为“只要教得好，不点名也不会缺席”。这是不对的，实际上会造成散漫自流现象。后来学校严格地规定了点名、请假制度，旷课时就发旷课通知书，对学员学习的好坏协同行政予以表扬批评。这对学习的推动也起了很大作用。
    六、应该根据机关干部的特点来进行教学。机关干部各科的知识是不平衡的，同时成人具有希望集中精力单科突击、要求速成的特点，他们要求学校给他们所缺乏和急迫需要的东西。因此学校应根据这些特点进行教学。我们编选了初中国文教材，以写作指导为中心，配以形式与内容相适合的文章，在讲课及批改作业方面都以此重点来要求，这对学员的语文知识及写作能力的提高上是有很大帮助的。语法课程的集中讲授方法也是他们所欢迎的。我们连续开办了三期语法班，学员来的很踊跃，每期不下五六百人。
    存在的问题和希望
    机关业余文化学校今后需要研究如何更进一步地提高和走向正规化。机关负责同志，由于工作繁忙，不可能具体地领导机关业余文化学校，因此需要有专门的领导机关来指导学校的业务。其次，在教材问题上，需要根据机关干部的特点，编一套适合在职干部要求的教材。我们虽在试编，但苦于业务水平的低下，编制教材的经验不足，加之精力和时间的限制，在具体工作中困难很多。这都是希望能尽速解决的。最后，我们希望领导方面在今后经常召开会议，来组织交流开办业余文化学校的经验。
