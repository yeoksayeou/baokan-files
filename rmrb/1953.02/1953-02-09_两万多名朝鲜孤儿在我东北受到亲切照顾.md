Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 6th: More than 21,000 Korean orphans, who came to Northeast China two months ago at the invitation of the Chinese government to be fostered, are living happy and fulfilling lives, receiving the deep care and love of the Chinese people. Most of these orphans lost their families and parents in the vicinity of the 38th parallel in the Gangwon Province area of Korea due to American air force bombings, or near the Korean coast due to shelling by the American navy. After arriving in Northeast China, these orphans were placed in newly established orphanages in cities and rural areas of Liaoxi, Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang and other provinces. Local Chinese children and mothers care for them as if they were their own siblings and children. When the Korean orphans arrived in Northeast China, the Chinese government provided them with thick overcoats, cotton-padded clothing, cotton hats, cotton boots, underwear, and various other necessities. Local Chinese mothers often sent them cakes and dishes, and Chinese children also bought pencils and notebooks for them. The Korean orphans in the orphanages eat rice at every meal, along with apples and other food. They eat pork twice a week, and young children also receive milk, eggs, snacks, and other soft foods. As a result, their health is steadily improving.

　　The Korean orphans in China are able to study a curriculum developed by the Ministry of Education of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. To thank the Chinese people for their care, and to avenge their parents when they grow up, the children study diligently and conscientiously. Shin Yong-cheol, who is only seven years old this year, consistently maintains excellent grades with perfect scores. He said: "Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung are particularly concerned about us and have given us such a good learning environment. If we don't study hard and prepare to contribute to our country, how can we live up to their expectations?" In addition to studying hard, the older children often engage in friendly ball games with Chinese children. Park Tae-yang, who participated in the Korean Juvenile Guerrilla Unit, also leads everyone in combat games.

　　During the New Year's Day period this year, the Northeast People's Comfort Delegation, while visiting the wounded and sick of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, also visited these Korean orphans. In order to thank the Comfort Delegation for their visit, the Korean orphans wrote letters to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, to express their gratitude. Orphan Li Feng-soo said in his letter to Chairman Mao: "We Korean children will never forget your care for the rest of our lives. We will study hard, exercise, grow up to fight the American devils, and prepare to build a new Korea in the future to repay your kindness!"

    两万多名朝鲜孤儿在我东北受到亲切照顾
    【新华社沈阳六日电】应中国政府邀请在两个月前来到中国东北抚养的两万一千多名朝鲜孤儿，受到中国人民的深切关怀和爱护，过着愉快幸福的生活。这些孤儿大部分都是在朝鲜“三八”线附近江原道一带被美国空军轰炸，或在朝鲜海岸附近被美国海军的炮击而失掉了家庭和父母的。这些孤儿来到中国东北以后，被安置在辽西、辽东、吉林、松江等省的城市或农村里的许多新设的孤儿抚养院中。当地中国儿童和母亲们照顾他们像亲兄弟和亲儿女一样。当朝鲜孤儿到达东北后，中国政府就发给了他们厚厚的大衣、棉衣、棉帽、棉靴、内衣及各种生活必需品。当地中国母亲们还经常送糕送菜给他们，中国小朋友们也买了铅笔、本子送给他们。在各抚养院的朝鲜孤儿们，每顿都吃到大米饭，还有苹果等食物，一周能吃两次猪肉，幼儿还能吃到牛乳、鸡蛋、点心等软食。因此他们的身体日渐健康起来。
    朝鲜孤儿在中国能够学到由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国教育省制定的课程。孩子们为了感谢中国人民的关怀，为了长大了给父母报仇，学习时都很勤奋用心。今年才七岁的申龙哲经常保持着满分的优秀学习成绩。他说：“毛主席和金日成将军特别关心我们，给了我们这样好的学习环境，若不好好学习，准备为祖国出力，那能对得起谁呢？”孩子们除了努力学习以外，年岁较大的还常常和中国儿童进行友谊的球赛。曾参加过朝鲜少年游击队的朴泰阳还领导大家进行战斗游戏。
    今年元旦期间，东北人民各界慰问团在慰问中国人民志愿军伤病员的同时，也慰问了这些朝鲜孤儿。为了答谢慰问团的慰问，朝鲜孤儿们纷纷写信向中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席表示谢意。孤儿李凤洙在给毛主席的信中说：“我们朝鲜儿童一辈子都忘不了您的关怀，我们一定努力学习，锻炼身体，长大了打美国鬼子，准备将来建设新朝鲜，来报答您的恩情！”
