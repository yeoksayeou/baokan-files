    Seriously Learn from the Experience of Soviet Geological Work
    Liu Jie, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government
    In order to effectively learn from the advanced Soviet geological exploration experience, the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government invited Soviet experts to give nine reports at the recent National Geological Personnel Conference. The reports covered the basic requirements for geological survey and exploration, the classification, exploration, calculation, and evaluation of mineral reserves, mine geological work, coal selection and industrial characteristics of coal, the characteristics of petroleum geology, the classification and exploration methods of copper, the arrangement of geological exploration work for chromium ore, as well as hydrogeology, engineering geology, and other issues, all of which were explained by combining theory and practice, and a systematic and complete set of scientific methods was introduced. The geologists who attended the meeting discussed the reports of the Soviet experts in light of China's actual conditions, initially criticized erroneous professional thinking, and formulated several draft technical specifications. This kind of led, planned, large-scale, and systematic learning of advanced Soviet experience is the first time in the geological field. For China's geological work, which has a very weak foundation, and for China's geological workers, who lack or have no practical exploration experience, this kind of learning is very necessary.
    Soviet geological science and technology have clear purposefulness and comprehensiveness. Whether it is studying geological structures, stratigraphy, paleontology, or conducting actual survey, exploration, etc., the purpose is to discover useful minerals and make a comprehensive evaluation from the perspective of mining technology, the national economy, and national defense, and hand it over to the industrial sector as soon as possible for use in developing the national economy. This is fundamentally different from the view of some of our geological workers in the past who only interpreted nature in an "academic" way without focusing on utilizing and transforming nature.
    Soviet geological science and technology not only integrate the achievements of science and technology from all over the world, but also accumulate rich experience in long-term socialist practice and create the most advanced theories of geology and mineral deposits. Therefore, it is the most advanced and superior science. In the past, imperialists also established and spread various assumptions and "theories" in the field of geological science in China, but these assumptions and "theories" were all beneficial to imperialism and harmful to the Chinese people. For example, they arbitrarily believed that oil was only stored in the Tertiary and its marine sedimentary layers, and that there were few Tertiary sediments on the Chinese mainland, and therefore believed that China was the most oil-poor country. However, using the advanced theory of oil field formation, preservation, and development created by the Soviet Union, it has been proven that oil fields are widely distributed in China. This scientific conclusion has also been confirmed in practice. For example, in the past it was believed that porphyry copper deposits only existed in large quantities on the American continent, while there were few in the Eastern Hemisphere (Africa, Europe, Asia), but according to Soviet experience, it has been proven that this assertion is false. With the help of Soviet experts, the recent discoveries in southern Shaanxi illustrate the possibility that there are also large quantities of porphyry copper deposits in China. Therefore, in order to effectively develop the resources of the motherland, we must accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fight against various anti-scientific "theories" and inferences.
    Soviet geological surveying and exploration work adopts and creates a complete set of scientific methods. The progress and results of exploration have a high degree of precision and accuracy. This is a concrete manifestation of the rational and long-term utilization of national resources to benefit the people in accordance with the socialist economic laws of the Soviet Union. It is fundamentally different from the predatory mining methods of capitalist countries that aim to pursue maximum profits. For example, the geological point working method in Soviet geological surveys, the classification of mineral deposits, drilling, trenching, the arrangement of pit exploration, delineating ore bodies and calculating reserves, and the classification of mineral quantities in mine exploration are all new working methods and a complete set of scientific and technical experience. In order to improve the scientific level of China's geological work and improve the quality standards of work, we must abandon some subjective, rough, and arbitrary estimates and conjectures that existed in our geological work in the past that were not scientific, and resolutely adopt the advanced scientific methods of the Soviet Union.
    Soviet geological workers have a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. They work faithfully to complete the tasks of the country. Their greatest encouragement is to discover new mines and be able to prove them through exploration to ensure the needs of national construction. The Soviet geological experts in China tirelessly impart their advanced experience, and sometimes personally go to the construction site to assist us in surveying. This noble political quality is also very different from the irresponsible and narrow-minded nationalist sentiments of some of our geological workers in the past. Our geological workers should also learn from them.
    However, it must be emphasized that learning from the advanced Soviet experience in the geological department is not smooth sailing. For example, some people say: "The advanced Soviet experience is good, but it is not necessarily achievable!" "The standard is too high, can the task be completed?" "The Soviet Union has a set, and we also have a set!" "Soviet experience is just a method and style, there is no theory," and so on. These doubts and confrontational ideas must be persuaded and criticized. After listening to the reports of the Soviet experts at this geological workers' conference, through group discussions, reviewing past work, and comparing the new Soviet methods with the old methods, there has been a great change in the above-mentioned ideas. If we earnestly apply the advanced Soviet geological theories and experience to our practice, and further educate geological workers with its practical effects, these doubts can be further overcome. Therefore, it can be said that this conference is the beginning of responding to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the Soviet Union, the beginning of realizing the great transformation of geological work as instructed by Vice Premier Chen Yun, and also the beginning of the transformation and construction of geological work business. At the same time, this conference has also created favorable conditions for completing the national exploration tasks in 1953.
    However, this time we learned from the advanced Soviet experience, but it was not deep or thorough enough. How to implement it and set off a climax of learning still requires continued efforts. First of all, the leadership must set an example, take the lead in learning, and vigorously mobilize the masses to learn from the Soviet experience. At the same time, strengthen inspection work, strengthen specific leadership, oppose treating the learning of Soviet experience with a bad bureaucratic attitude, those who work hard to learn and work according to norms should be commended, and those who do not learn or do not seriously learn and do not follow norms should be criticized. Secondly, we must constantly improve our awareness, firmly grasp the clear purposefulness, eliminate ideological obstacles in learning, persuade those who still have doubts, and criticize those who oppose. At the same time, all geological personnel should systematically review past professional views and methods through learning, draw a clear line between what is right and wrong, resolutely abandon what is wrong, and make what is useful more improved, complete, and developed. Thirdly, in addition to universally launching learning and earnestly applying Soviet experience, we must also grasp the key points, cultivate backbones, create typical examples, summarize experience, and promote it. Finally, we must continue to invite Soviet experts to introduce experience in a planned way, translate a large number of Soviet books, and enrich the learning materials for the majority of cadres. Only by doing these things can we set off a climax of learning from the Soviet Union. Only by learning and applying the advanced Soviet experience can our country's geological work advance rapidly and can we undertake the task of large-scale national construction.

    认真学习苏联地质工作的经验
    中央人民政府地质部副部长　刘杰
    为了有效地学习苏联先进的地质勘探经验，中央地质部在最近召开的全国地质人员会议上，请苏联专家作了九个报告。报告中对于进行地质普查和勘探的基本要求，矿产储量的分级、勘探、及其计算与评价，矿山地质工作，选煤及煤的工业特性，石油地质的特点，铜的分类与勘探法，铬矿地质勘探工作的布置，以及水文地质、工程地质等等问题，都作了理论与实际相结合的说明，并介绍了一套系统完整的科学方法。到会的地质工作者，结合中国的实际情况，讨论了苏联专家的报告，初步批判了错误的业务思想，制订了若干技术规范草案。这种有领导、有计划、大规模地、系统地学习苏联先进经验，在地质界来说还是第一次。对于基础非常薄弱的我国地质工作来说，对于缺乏或者没有实际勘探经验的我国地质工作者来说，这种学习是非常必要的。
    苏联的地质科学和技术，具有明确的目的性、综合性。不论是研究地质构造、地层、古生物，或者是实际进行普查、勘探等，其目的都是为了发现有用矿物，并从开采技术、国民经济和国防观点上作出全面的评价，尽快地将它交给工业部门使用，以发展国民经济。这是与我们过去某些地质工作者只是“学院式”地解释自然而不着眼于利用和改造自然的观点根本不相同的。
    苏联的地质科学和技术，不仅综合了全世界科学和技术的成果，而且在长期社会主义实践中积累了丰富的经验，创立了最先进的地质和矿床的理论。因而它是最先进的和最优越的科学。过去帝国主义者在中国的地质科学领域内，也曾建立和传播着种种假定和“理论”，但这种种假定和“理论”都是与帝国主义有利而与中国人民有害的。比如他们武断地认为石油仅储藏于第三纪及其海相沉积层内，中国大陆上第三纪沉积很少，因而就认为中国是石油最贫乏的国家。可是运用苏联创立的先进的油田生成、保存和开发的理论，则证明中国国土内油田分布极为广泛。这种科学论断，在实践中也已得到证实。又如，过去认为斑状铜矿，只是在美洲大陆上才大量存在，而东半球（非、欧、亚洲）则很少，但是根据苏联的经验已经证明这种论断是虚伪的。在苏联专家的帮助下，最近在陕南的新发现，就说明了中国斑铜矿也有大量存在的可能性。因此，为了有效地开发祖国的资源，就必须接受苏联先进经验，向各种反科学的“理论”和推断作斗争。
    苏联的地质测量与勘探工作，采用和创造了一套完整的科学的方法，勘探的进行和结果，都是具有高度的精密度和准确性的。这是按照苏联社会主义的经济法则，合理地、长期地利用国家资源，以造福于人民的具体表现，它与资本主义国家以追求最高利润为目的而进行掠夺式的开采方法有原则的区别。比如苏联在地质普查中的地质点工作法，在矿区勘探中的矿床分类、钻探、槽探、坑探的布置、圈定矿体和计算储量、矿量分级等，都是新的工作方法，是一套完整的科学技术经验。为了提高中国地质工作的科学水平，及提高工作的质量标准，我们就必须抛弃我国地质工作中过去存在着的某些主观主义、粗枝大叶、随意估计臆测的不够科学的方法和作风，坚决采取苏联先进的科学的方法。
    苏联地质工作者，具有高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神。他们为完成国家的任务而忠诚地工作着。对他们最大的鼓励，就是发现新矿并能经过勘探得到证实，以保证国家建设的需要。在中国的苏联地质专家，他们不疲倦地传授着他们的先进经验，有时亲到工地协助我们勘察。这种崇高的政治品质也是与我们过去某些地质工作者不负责任及怀有狭隘的民族主义情绪的观点及作风大不相同的。我国的地质工作者，也应向他们学习。
    但是，必须着重指出：在地质部门中学习苏联先进经验，并不是一帆风顺的。例如有人说：“苏联先进经验好是好，但是不一定办得到！”“这样要求标准太高，是否能完成任务？”“苏联有一套，我们也有一套呀！”“苏联经验不过是方法方式，没有理论”等等。对这些怀疑和对抗思想，必须加以说服和批判。这次地质工作者会议上听取了苏联专家的报告后，经过小组讨论，检查了过去的工作，并将苏联的新方法和旧方法加以对比，对上述思想已有很大改变。如果认真地将苏联先进的地质理论和经验运用于我们的实践中，以其实际效果进一步教育地质工作者，这些怀疑还可以进一步加以克服的。因而可以说，这次会议是响应毛主席号召学习苏联的一个开端，是实现陈云副总理所指示的地质工作大转变的开端，也是地质工作业务的改造与建设的开端。同时，这次会议也为完成一九五三年的国家勘探任务，创造了有利的条件。
    但是，这次学习苏联先进经验，还是学得不深不透的。如何贯彻下去，掀起一个学习高潮，还须要继续努力。首先，领导上必须以身作则，带头学习，大力发动群众学习苏联经验。同时加强检查工作，加强具体领导，反对以恶劣的官僚主义态度对待学习苏联经验，凡是努力学习按照规范进行工作的都要受到表扬，凡是不学习或不认真学习、不照规范执行的都要受到批评。其次，必须不断地提高觉悟，紧紧掌握明确的目的性，扫除学习当中的思想障碍，说服那些还有怀疑的人，批判那些对抗的思想。同时应该使所有的地质人员，通过学习，系统地检查过去的业务观点和方法，划清对的和错的界限，坚决抛弃错误的东西，使有用的东西更加提高、完整与发展。再次，除了普遍发动学习和认真运用苏联经验以外，还必须抓住重点，培养骨干，创造典型，总结经验，加以推广。最后，必须继续有计划地请苏联专家介绍经验，大量翻译苏联书籍，充实广大干部的学习资料。只有做到这些，才能掀起一个学习苏联的高潮。只有学习和运用了苏联先进经验，我国的地质工作才会迅速前进，才能担负起国家大规模建设的任务。
