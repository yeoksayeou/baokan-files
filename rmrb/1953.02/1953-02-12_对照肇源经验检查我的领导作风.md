    Examining My Leadership Style in Light of the Zhaoyuan Experience
    Ji Huanzhang

    Editor's Note: With the exception of the Northeast region, most county-level leading cadres across the country have not paid sufficient attention to the experience of Zhaoyuan County in leading the high-yield movement. We suggest that leading cadres in all counties, like Comrade Ji Huanzhang of Yin County, Zhejiang, examine their methods and styles of leading agricultural production in light of the Zhaoyuan experience; and we hope that our correspondents will promptly report on their learning and examination.

    I am engaged in agricultural production leadership work in Yin County, Zhejiang Province. Although I have been doing agricultural production leadership work for a relatively long time, and have spoken to farmers about increasing production quite a bit, I am still vague about what the main experiences of agricultural production in our county are. The potential of agricultural production awaits our exploration, but we do not know exactly where that potential lies. Recently, I studied the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, published in the People's Daily, and the reports of leading cadres in Fuyu County examining their methods of leading agricultural production, and made a comparison with myself. This has given me a very practical and profound education. I realize that in the past, there was a great deal of blindness in my leadership work, and I lost my sensitivity in the face of new things. In recent years, the masses of farmers in Yin County have also created some high yields and rich production experiences. We have also come into contact with these issues. However, we considered them "very ordinary" and let them slip away lightly. Even when we discovered some experiences, they were piecemeal and we did not analyze, study, and elevate them. High-yield model Zhang Genxiang created a relatively high yield per unit area of rice in 1951, but we did not scientifically summarize Zhang Genxiang's high-yield experience. As a result, Zhang Genxiang's yield in 1952 was not as high as in 1951. Labor model Yuan Rengui's three mu, nine fen, six li of land produced an average of one thousand and twenty-five jin of grain per mu. His high-yield experience is precisely equal spacing and uniform seedlings. But we turned a blind eye to this discovered problem.

    The main reason for the above shortcomings is that we did not go deep among the masses, did not go deep into the production process, had a weak mass perspective, and lacked sensitivity to new things. In recent years, in leading agricultural production, we have been dominated by generalized practices, only doing some "top-down" work, only emphasizing "executing tasks," but not going deep among the masses to investigate. Although agricultural production in Yin County has improved over the past three years, it is still far behind other high-yield areas. In the past three years, we have not been able to effectively develop the creativity of the masses in agricultural production, accumulate rich agricultural production experience, and subjectively believe that the masses have conservative ideas and are not easy to accept advanced experience. In fact, we are precisely "guiding production from outside of production," using "laymen to guide experts." We ourselves have conservative ideas, believing that it is not yet time to use machine production, and that yields are subject to certain limitations. Because of this, we have not explored the potential of production to further increase the yield per unit area. Our understanding of agricultural science and technology is also very poor, so we failed to promptly correct the anti-scientific method of sparse planting of rice proposed by the masses through propaganda and education. We also have an insufficient understanding of agricultural production as a delicate and complex science, and we do not have a firm grasp of the interrelationships and complementarities of various yield-increasing factors in the agricultural production process, often unilaterally emphasizing one factor while ignoring another. For example, blindly applying more fertilizer and weeding more often leads to adverse consequences.

    Such a leadership style and leadership method cannot meet the farmers' urgent need for advanced experience. This generalized method of leading agricultural production is no longer keeping up with the situation of large-scale economic construction. By studying the production experience and leadership methods of Zhaoyuan County and examining my own work style, I have realized how much loss I have caused to the country and the people in the past.

    Looking at it today, the farming methods in our county are old-fashioned and backward, especially the planting methods are very poor, and the land is greatly wasted. Judging from the existing examples of high yields, the potential of the land in Yin County is very great, and the water conservancy conditions and soil quality are not bad. As long as we work hard, the yield of the entire county can be greatly increased. In the future, I am determined to change my style of not going deep into reality, abandon generalized working methods, go deep among the masses, go deep into the production process, strengthen investigation and research, use my brain more to consider problems, and start from the masses' piecemeal experience to delve into it, in order to further discover more problems and better high-yield experiences. In the future, we must also strengthen the study of agricultural production experience and agricultural science and technology, and combine agricultural production science and technology with mass experience to enrich the content of agricultural production.

### 对照肇源经验检查我的领导作风

    对照肇源经验检查我的领导作风
    季焕章
    编者按：除了东北地区以外，全国多数县份的领导干部对于肇源县领导丰产运动的经验，还没有足够的重视。我们建议各县领导干部都像浙江鄞县季焕章同志这样，对照肇源经验，检查自己领导农业生产的方法和作风；并希望通讯员同志们把学习和检查的情形及时报道出来。
    我在浙江省鄞县做农业生产领导工作。我虽然做了较长时期的农业生产领导工作，而且也对农民讲了不少增产的道理，但是对于本县农业生产的主要经验是什么，却是模模糊糊的。农业生产潜在力等待我们去发掘，但是我们却不知道农业生产的潜在力究竟在那里。最近我学习了人民日报上登载的黑龙江省肇源县的丰产经验和富裕县领导干部检查农业生产领导方法的报道，和自己作了一个对比。我这就受了一次很实际很深刻的教育，我认识到自己过去在领导工作中存在着很大的盲目性，在新鲜事物面前丧失了感觉。这些年来，鄞县农民群众也创造了一些高额产量和丰产经验。我们也曾接触过这些问题。但是我们却认为它“很平凡”，让它轻轻地溜过去了。即使发现了一些经验，也是点点滴滴的，没有加以分析研究和提高。丰产模范张根祥，一九五一年创造了较高的水稻单位面积产量，但是我们却没有把张根祥的丰产经验加以科学的总结。因此，张根祥一九五二年的产量还不如一九五一年高。劳动模范袁仁贵三亩九分六厘田，每市亩平均产谷一千零二十五斤。他的丰产经验，正是等距、苗匀。而我们对于这个已发现的问题，却熟视无睹。
    产生上述缺点的主要原因，是我们没有深入群众，没有深入到生产过程中去，群众观点薄弱，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感。这几年来，我们在领导农业生产上，被一般化的作法所支配，只是做了一些“上行下达”的工作，光强调“执行任务”，却不深入群众中去调查。三年来鄞县的农业生产虽然有了提高，但和其他丰产地区相比较却距离很远。三年来在农业生产上我们不能很好地发扬群众的创造性，积累丰富的农业生产经验，还主观地认为群众有保守思想，不易接受先进经验。其实，我们正是“站在生产以外指导生产”，以“外行指导内行”。我们自己就有保守思想，认为现在还不是用机器生产，产量是受到一定的限制的。正因为这样，我们就没有去发掘生产潜在力，进一步提高单位面积产量。我们对农业科学技术的认识也很差，所以对群众提出的反科学的水稻稀植方法就没能及时用宣传教育的方法进行纠正。我们对于农业生产是一项细致的复杂的科学也认识不足，对农业生产过程中各种增产因素的联因互补掌握不牢，常常片面地强调某一种因子，而忽略了另一种因子。如盲目地多施肥、多耘田，反而造成不良的后果。
    这样的领导作风和领导方法，是不能满足农民对于先进经验的迫切要求的。这样一般化的领导农业生产方法，已经跟不上大规模经济建设的形势。通过学习肇源县的生产经验和领导方法，检查我自己的工作作风，我才明白我过去不知给国家和人民造成了多大的损失。
    今天看来，我们县里的耕作方法是老一套的，落后的，特别是种植方法很差，地力浪费很大。从已有的丰产事例看，鄞县土地潜在力是很大的，水利条件和土质都还不差。只要我们好好努力，全县的产量是可以大大提高的。今后我决心转变自己不深入实际的作风，抛弃一般化的工作方法，深入群众，深入到生产过程中去，加强调查研究，多用脑子考虑问题，并从群众一点一滴的经验着手钻进去，以便进一步发现更多的问题，和更好的丰产经验。今后也必须加强农业生产经验和农业科学技术的学习，把农业生产科学技术和群众经验结合起来，丰富农业生产的内容。
