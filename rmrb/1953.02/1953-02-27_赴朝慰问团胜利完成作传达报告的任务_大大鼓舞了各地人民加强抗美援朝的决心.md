Xinhua News Agency report: The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has successfully completed its mission of conveying reports to people across the country.

After returning from the Korean front in November of last year, the delegation, following a period of preparation, began in December to disseminate reports to people in major administrative regions, key cities, and along railway lines throughout the country, using sub-delegations and groups. The performance troupes attached to each sub-delegation also presented many outstanding artistic programs brought back from the Korean front, complementing the representatives' reports. According to incomplete statistics, the delegation's various sub-delegations have delivered more than 3,300 reports to people of all ethnic groups and sectors across the country, with a direct audience of over 7.2 million.

While delivering reports in various locations, representatives of the Second Sub-Delegation ventured deep into the Tibetan autonomous areas of Tianzhu and Zhuoni in Gansu Province, and Xiahe County, as well as the Alxa Banner Mongolian autonomous area in Ningxia Province. Representatives of the Third Sub-Delegation visited Qamdo on the Kangzang Plateau, Tengchong on the Yunnan border, and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, directly meeting with people from more than 40 ethnic groups. Representatives of the Fourth Sub-Delegation delivered reports to the general public in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other cities via People's Broadcasting Stations. According to Zhejiang Province statistics alone, more than 490,000 people listened to the broadcasts. The Fifth Sub-Delegation reached the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area, Guangzhou, and major cities in Central and South China. Representatives of the Sixth Sub-Delegation reported in Hebei, Shanxi, and Mengsui for a month. In addition to delivering reports in major and medium-sized cities in Northeast China, the Seventh Sub-Delegation also visited many famous factories and mines, reporting on the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's forces to the vast number of workers.

The reports by the delegation representatives greatly inspired the people of various regions to continue strengthening the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and to actively participate in the large-scale national economic construction. After listening to the reports and watching the performances of the delegation's performance troupe, the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine in the Northwest earnestly revised their patriotic pacts and put forward plans to improve production; many workers of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways expressed their determination to learn from the People's Volunteer Army's high level of patriotism and internationalism, and voluntarily signed up to work on the Korean front and participate in the arduous construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. After hearing the report from their representative Lu Jin-di, who returned from the Korean front, the workers of the Lu Jin-di team in the fine yarn workshop of the State-run Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Mill immediately revised their patriotic pact and the conditions for challenging the Hao Jianxiu team, resolving to further increase production and practice thrift to support the most beloved people. The workers of the State-run No. 102 Steel Plant discussed the report of the delegation representative and raised the production plan for the first and second quarters of this year by 18.5%, reducing the coal consumption rate from the quota of 0.868 kg to 0.84 kg. After hearing the report of Niu Rusen, a worker at the Yunnan Iron Factory, an industrial model worker, and a representative of the delegation, the workers of the factory put forward two rationalization proposals in one day of technical assessment, saving a large amount of wealth for the country.

After listening to the reports, farmers in various places successively proposed to produce more grain to support the most beloved people. All the farmers in Wangmang Village, Shaanxi Province, wrote a letter to the Volunteer Army, expressing their efforts to produce and continue to strengthen the power of resisting America and aiding Korea. Xu Yanzhang, the village chief of Yangfengtai Village in Changli County, Hebei Province, said: "After listening to the report, I feel that even a little carelessness and loophole in my work would let down the Volunteer Army. I must do a good job in supporting the families of soldiers and all other work." After listening to the report, the farmers of Pindig County told the delegation representative on the spot: "Please tell Commander Peng and all the comrades of the Volunteer Army that we have people and grain, and we will resist America and aid Korea to the end." Herdsmen in the Alxa Banner Mongolian Autonomous Region of Ningxia Province expressed their determination to support the Volunteer Army's struggle to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions to develop animal husbandry. The Uyghur farmers in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang are actively repairing karez wells, hauling soil, and applying fertilizer, striving for a bumper harvest in 1953.

Before and after the delegation representatives went to various places to deliver reports, people from all over the country successively wrote letters of appreciation or presented gifts to the Volunteer Army. The Zhejiang Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association received more than 11,700 letters of appreciation and more than 8,600 gifts in a very short period of time. After listening to the reports, Yu Yanhuan, Shen Guizhao, and Yu Lijun, workers of the Hangzhou No. 2 Silk Factory, donated the prizes they won in the labor competition—three pens and a labor competition commemorative album—to the Volunteer Army as souvenirs.

    赴朝慰问团胜利完成作传达报告的任务
    大大鼓舞了各地人民加强抗美援朝的决心
    据新华社讯：中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团已胜利完成向全国各地人民作传达报告的任务。
    慰问团自去年十一月从朝鲜前线回国以后，经过了一个时期的准备工作，于去年十二月份以分团和小组为单位，先后分赴全国各大行政区、主要城市和铁道沿线向全国人民进行传达报告。各分团所属文工队也配合着代表们的报告，表演了许多从朝鲜前线带回来的精彩的文艺节目。据不完全统计，慰问团各分团已在全国各地向各族各界人民作了三千三百多次传达报告，直接听到报告的听众达七百二十多万人。
    在赴各地作传达报告时，第二分团的代表曾深入到甘肃省藏族聚居区天祝、卓尼自治区和夏河县，以及宁夏省蒙族聚居区阿拉善旗等地；第三分团的代表到了康藏高原上的昌都和云南边境上的腾冲以及大凉山彝族自治区。直接和四十多个兄弟民族的人民见了面。第四分团的代表在上海、南京、济南、杭州、福州、厦门等地，通过人民广播电台向广大人民作传达报告，仅据浙江省统计，收听广播的群众即达四十九万多人。第五分团到达了荆江分洪区和广州及中南各大中城市。第六分团代表在河北、山西、蒙绥等地报告了一个月。第七分团除在东北各大、中城市进行传达报告外，还到达了许多著名的厂矿，向广大职工报告朝中人民部队的英雄事迹。
    慰问团代表的传达报告，大大鼓舞了各地人民继续加强抗美援朝斗争与积极参加国家大规模经济建设的决心。西北玉门油矿职工在听了报告和看了慰问团文工队的演出后，都认真地修订了爱国公约，纷纷提出改进生产的计划；铁道部第一工程局许多工人表示要学习志愿军高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，自动报名到朝鲜前线工作和参加艰巨的兰新铁路的修建工程。国营上海第十九棉纺织厂细纱间陆金弟小组的工人听了他们的代表陆金弟从朝鲜前线回来的报告后，马上修订了爱国公约和向郝建秀小组应战的条件，决心进一步增产节约，支援最可爱的人。国营一零二钢铁厂工人座谈了慰问团代表的报告，将本年第一、二季度生产计划提高了百分之十八点五，耗煤率由定额零点八六八公斤降低到零点八四公斤。云南铁工厂的工人听了该厂工人、工业劳动模范、慰问团代表牛汝森的报告后，在一天的技术测定中就提出了两件合理化建议，为国家节约了大量的财富。
    各地农民在听了报告后，纷纷提出多打粮食支援最可爱的人。陕西王蟒村全体农民，写信给志愿军，表示努力生产，继续加强抗美援朝的力量。河北昌黎县杨封台村村长徐彦章说：“我听了报告后，觉得在工作上有一点疏忽和漏洞也对不起志愿军，我一定要作好优属代耕工作和其他一切工作。”平定县农民听完报告当场向慰问团代表说：“请转告彭司令员和志愿军全体同志，我们有人有粮，我们要抗美援朝到底。”宁夏省阿拉善旗蒙族自治区牧民们表示要以发展畜牧业的实际行动支援志愿军抗美援朝的斗争。新疆吐鲁番盆地的维吾尔族农民正积极修理坎井、拉土、上粪，争取一九五三年的大丰收。
    在慰问团代表分赴各地作传达报告的前后，各地人民纷纷给志愿军写慰问信或献赠慰问品。浙江省抗美援朝分会在很短时间内即收到慰问信一万一千七百多封、慰问品八千六百多件。杭州第二绸厂工人虞延焕、沈桂招、于理君在听了报告后，把自己劳动竞赛中所获得的奖品——三支钢笔和劳动竞赛纪念册献给志愿军作纪念。
