Title: Paris "Tonight's News" Reporter Bertrand Reports: The Reality of the Korean Battlefield Proves That the U.S. Air Force Has Gone Bankrupt; If the U.S. Air Force Invading Korea Expands Its Scope of Operations, It Will Inevitably Suffer Even Greater Disastrous Defeats

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a report by Bertrand, a reporter for the Paris "Tonight's News," the U.S. Air Force, as a military weapon, has been a great failure. This is one of the most startling aspects of the Korean War. For the past several months, the value of the U.S. Air Force as a military weapon has been virtually zero. It can only be regarded as a weapon of terror, used to destroy the people's villages and homes. Due to the effective defense of the Korean Air Force fighter jets, American bombers have long dared not bomb during the day. The proud Super Fortress, claiming to be able to withstand fighter attacks, only dares to come at night to blindly bomb cities that have become ruins, cities that no longer exist, now only the underground shelters of the Korean people. Even at night, the Super Fortress is likely to be shot down by vigilant night-flying fighters. The only other bomber used in Korea, the B-26, also only dares to come out at night, attempting to destroy highway and railway traffic. If even half of the combat results reported by the U.S. Air Force in bombing traffic were true, then North Korea or China would not have a single truck. The battle results claimed by the United States are not half true, not one-tenth true, not even one-hundredth true. The truth is that the U.S. Air Force used all its strength to fly during the day to bomb highways and railway bridges, and to fly at night to bomb traffic, but it could not even stop supplies from being transported to the front lines for a single night. If the battle results claimed by the United States were even a little bit true, then I would have died many times over from traveling on North Korean roads so many times. In fact, the only time my life was in danger was when I trusted the "honor" of the U.S. military and traveled during the day in a convoy of negotiating delegations that the U.S. side had guaranteed would not be attacked. As a result, the Americans knew it was a delegation convoy and immediately attacked it. In fact, the dilapidated trucks I saw on the highway were the vehicles abandoned by the Americans during their hasty retreat in 1950.

Trying to bomb military targets during the day, like blindly bombing traffic at night, has also suffered a great failure. The vigilant Korean Air Force has not allowed American super heavy bombers to rampage arbitrarily in North Korean skies for over a year. Medium and light bombers, fearing North Korean fighters and accurate anti-aircraft fire, dare not come. The Americans were forced to temporarily convert fighters into bombers. But the only fighters that can accurately bomb are those slow-flying propeller-driven aircraft, which can select targets and dive-bomb. But these aircraft dare not come anywhere north of the battle line and can only be used for close support of troops, and are useless when trying to destroy the top of Heartbreak Ridge on the front lines. In order to attack what the Americans consider to be military targets, they are forced to make even more insane temporary modifications—tying two bombs to the wings of jet fighters, which can no longer be used as fighters because the Korean Air Force has absolutely surpassed them. A year ago, the U.S. Air Force was very conceited about its F-80 and F-84 jet fighters, but now these warhorses have been used as packhorses. They only dare to come out when there are a large number of F-86 aircraft (Sabre jets) to cover them. They dare not fly low to bomb real military targets because they fear anti-aircraft fire, so they just throw bombs randomly at high altitude and flee in a panic, hoping not to encounter Korean fighters. They only dare to fly low over undefended villages and use napalm and high-explosive bombs to accurately destroy these villages. As an effective military weapon, the U.S. Air Force in Korea has gone bankrupt. And the terror tactics they have adopted only serve to increase the Korean people's anger and hatred towards the American aggressors.

If the situation in which they cruelly burned alive thousands of women, children, and elderly in Pyongyang and other cities cannot be considered a military victory, then the U.S. Air Force's victory in Korea last year is limited to those absurd fabrications in the communiqués. All their communiqués are contrary to the facts. I have traveled in Korea day and night many times in recent months, but the destruction of the U.S. Air Force has not hindered me for even five minutes—if the daytime attack on the delegation convoy is not included.

This is a war of man against machine, and it is a war in which man has the advantage. Before those flying machines have flown out of hearing, people go to repair the damaged things. They do not need road openers, cranes, or trusses imported from the United States when repairing roads or bridges. They only use their bare hands and tools that can be held in their hands to work.

People can train a beast-like person to press a button on a machine and throw napalm bombs at Korean homes. People can formulate a bombing plan and calculate how many aircraft carrying how many bombs must be used to destroy seventy-eight Korean towns of all sizes. But no execution plan and no trained beast-like person can eliminate the resistance will of an entire nation. Judging from those beast-like people, bombing execution plans, and U.S. Air Force communiqués, the Korean army, industrial facilities, and transportation equipment have been destroyed many times more than they actually have. But in reality, the Korean War proves that the U.S. Air Force has suffered a disastrous defeat. If they admitted the real figures of the U.S. Air Force's losses, then the average weekly loss of U.S. military aircraft in combat operations alone would be thirty to forty, and the world could see from this how disastrously the U.S. Air Force has been defeated. U.S. aircraft—which recently intruded into Chinese territory—have been shot down in day and night air raids, which warns them that if they intend to expand the scope of operations, they will inevitably suffer even greater disastrous defeats.

    朝鲜战场的实际证明美国空军已经破产
    侵朝美空军如扩大作战范围必将遭到更大惨败
    【新华社六日讯】据巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌报道，美国空军作为军事武器来说，是大大地失败了，这是朝鲜战争中若干最惊人的方面之一。过去若干月来，美国空军作为一种军事武器来说，它的价值实际上等于零。它实际上只能被当作一种恐怖武器，用来摧毁老百姓的乡村和家室。由于朝鲜空军战斗机的有效防御，美国轰炸机久已不敢在白天来轰炸了。骄傲的超级空中堡垒自称能抵御战斗机的袭击，却只敢在黑夜里前来，盲目地轰炸已经成为废墟的城市，这些城市早已不存在了，现在只有朝鲜老百姓的地下掩蔽部。甚至在夜间，超级空中堡垒也很可能被机警的夜航战斗机所击落。在朝鲜使用的唯一其他轰炸机B—二十六型飞机，也只敢在夜间出来，企图炸毁公路和铁路交通。假使美国空军在轰炸交通方面所报的战果有一半是真的话，那末北朝鲜或中国就没有一辆卡车了。美国所宣称的战果，没有一半是真的，没有十分之一是真的，甚至没有百分之一是真的。真实的情况是：美国空军用了全力在白天飞来轰炸公路和铁路桥梁，夜间飞来轰炸交通，但是甚至一夜都没有能够阻止供应品运到前线去。如果美国所宣称的战果有一点点是真的话，则我在北朝鲜公路上旅行那末多次，早也就死过许多次了。事实上，我的生命遇到危险的唯一一次是：我信任了美国军事的“荣誉”，白天坐在美方曾经保证不加袭击的谈判代表团车队的车子上旅行，结果美国人知道了这是代表团车队，就立刻加以袭击。实际上，我在公路上所看到的破烂卡车，就是美国人在一九五○年急急忙忙撤退时所遗弃的那些车辆。
    想在白天轰炸军事目标，和在夜间盲目轰炸交通一样，也遭到很大失败。机警的朝鲜空军不让美国超级重轰炸机在北朝鲜天空任意横行，已有一年多了。中型轰炸机和轻型轰炸机惧怕北朝鲜战斗机和准确的高射炮火，不敢前来。美国人被迫将战斗机临时改充轰炸机。但是唯一能够准确地进行轰炸的战斗机，就是那些飞得很慢的螺旋桨推进的飞机，这种飞机能够选定目标，进行俯冲轰炸。但是这种飞机不敢到战线以北的任何地方来，几乎只能用来紧密支援军队，而要想在前线摧毁伤心岭的山顶时，却又毫无用处。为了要袭击美国人所认为的军事目标，他们被迫作更疯狂的临时改装——把两枚炸弹系在喷气战斗机的翼上，这些飞机已不再能当作战斗机了，因为朝鲜空军已经绝对地超过了它们。一年前美国空军十分自负他们的F—八十型和F—八十四型喷气机，现在这种跑马已被当作拖马用了。只在有了大批F—八十六型飞机（佩刀式喷气机）可以掩护它们的时候，它们才敢出动。对于真正的军事目标，它们因为害怕高射炮的炮火不敢低飞轰炸，只好在高空乱丢炸弹以后仓皇逃去，希望不要碰上朝鲜的战斗机。它们只有在毫无防御的村庄上空才敢低飞，用凝固汽油弹与高度爆炸弹很准确地去破坏这些村庄。作为有效的军事武器来说，朝鲜境内的美国空军已经破产。而它们所采用的恐怖手段，只有日益增加朝鲜人民对于美国侵略者的愤恨的怒火。
    假若他们那种用残酷的手段把平壤与其他城市中好几千妇孺老弱活活烧死的情形不能算是什么军事上的胜利，那么美国空军去年在朝鲜的胜利就只限于公报上那些荒谬可笑的杜撰。他们所有的公报都与事实相反，近数月来我在朝鲜白天夜里有过许多次的旅行，但是美国空军的破坏连五分钟也没有阻碍过我——假若把那次对于代表团车队所进行的白天的袭击不算在内的话。
    这是一场以人对抗机器的战争，并且是一场人占着优势的战争。在那些飞行机器还没有飞到听不见的时候，人们就去修理那些被破坏的东西。他们在修理公路或桥梁的时候，并不需要由美国输入的开路机、起重机或者构桁。他们只用空空的两手和两手可以拿的工具去工作。
    人们可以训练一个野兽似的人在机器上一按电纽把凝固汽油弹纷纷投向朝鲜人的住宅，人们可以订出一种轰炸执行计划，算出为了毁灭七十八个大小的朝鲜城镇必须要用多少架飞机装载多少枚炸弹，但是任何的执行计划和经过训练的野兽似的人都不能消灭整个民族的抗战意志。如果从那些野兽似的人、轰炸执行计划以及美国空军的公报上看来，朝鲜军队、工业设备和运输设备被毁的会比实际有的多好多倍。但是实际上，朝鲜战争证明了美国的空军遭到惨败。假若他们承认了美国空军损失的实在数字，那么仅在战斗行动中损失的美军飞机每周平均就要有三四十架之多，全世界可以从这里看出美国空军究竟惨败到怎样的地步。美国飞机——这些飞机最近曾窜入中国境内——在日以继夜的空袭中都有被击落的事情，这就警告了他们，假若他们打算扩大作战的范围，必然要遭到更大的惨败。
