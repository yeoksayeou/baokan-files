Studying Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents from the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has given me a comprehensive understanding of the current political situation. The period after World War II is one in which the world capitalist system is further weakening, and the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are growing stronger. The struggle among capitalist countries for markets and the desire to defeat their competitors are actually more intense than the contradictions between the capitalist and socialist camps. Therefore, Comrade Stalin concluded:

	"The inevitability of wars between capitalist countries remains." This scientific assertion is completely correct. However, we must not be deluded into thinking that the contradictions between the capitalist camp and the peace and democracy camp are unimportant, or that wars between them can be completely avoided. To think so would lead us to complacency and weaken our fighting will to defend the motherland. This would be extremely harmful.

One of the important ways for imperialism to obtain maximum profits is to use war to plunder the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries. The ongoing war of aggression by American imperialism in Korea, the wars of aggression waged by American and French imperialism in Vietnam, and the crimes of American imperialism in occupying our Taiwan all demonstrate the frantic aggression of imperialism against people's democratic countries, which has not been relaxed due to its internal contradictions; on the contrary, it attempts to launch aggression against the peace and democracy camp to "ease" its internal conflicts. The clamor of the new American President Eisenhower after taking office to expand the Korean War is a clear and blatant example. This cannot but arouse our serious vigilance and strengthen the task of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending the country.

In the three years since the liberation of our great motherland, thanks to the correct leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, a series of social reform movements have been carried out, further uniting all ethnic groups and parties, consolidating the people's democratic united front, rapidly restoring and developing the economy, and winning a great victory in resisting America and aiding Korea. However, imperialism hates these reforms and victories, and they will try every possible means to undermine these victories. Therefore, in order to protect the security of the motherland, "The People's Republic of China should strengthen its modernized army and build an air force and navy to consolidate national defense." (Common Program, Article 22) In the past three years, we have made great achievements in this regard. But it is still far from the task and requirements. Even a powerful country like the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov proposed at the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "Vigilantly watch the intrigues of the instigators of war. Strengthen the Soviet Army, Navy, and intelligence agencies by all means." Therefore, this task is even more urgent for our young motherland.

(II)

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been built for twenty-five years, always under the organization and leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, and has gradually developed and grown strong through the test of long-term revolutionary war, becoming a reliable force for defending the motherland, a powerful pillar of the people's democratic regime and world peace. All of this is inseparable from the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific military thought was born in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China and is a further development of Marxist-Leninist military science in the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. According to the characteristics and needs of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to revolutionary armed struggle. As early as 1927, in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," Comrade Mao Zedong advocated "overthrowing the armed landlords and establishing peasant armed forces." After the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party turned to the countryside to lead the peasants in guerrilla warfare. In 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong also said in a report to the Central Committee of the Party: "The Chinese revolution, with agriculture as its main economy, and the development of military uprisings, is a characteristic. We suggest that the Central Committee put great effort into the military movement." In 1939, in the "Foreword to 'The Communist'," he pointed out more clearly: "...In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." Because he valued armed struggle, systematically analyzed the objective reality with Marxist-Leninist scientific methods, foresaw the future development of the revolution, and planned and step-by-step proposed a series of military construction guidelines, strategies, tactics, and war principles to win the victory of the revolution, he transformed a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country into a new democratic country.

Comrade Mao Zedong's military line, like his political line, has always been completely correct. In the difficult environment of guerrilla warfare in 1928, when some comrades doubted the existence of small red regimes and asked "How long can the red flag be flown?" Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound analysis of the domestic and international situation and the enemy's situation and affirmatively replied: Small red regimes can exist; and pointed out that "China is full of dry wood, which will soon burn into a raging fire." "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The victory of the whole country now proves this genius scientific prediction.

Comrade Mao Zedong's military construction thought is equally outstanding. In the resolution of the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army in 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong wisely proposed that military construction should focus on ideological construction, Party construction, and political work construction, that is, strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party in the army; at the same time, he specifically stipulated the three major tasks of the Red Army: fighting, raising funds, and doing mass work; he also stipulated the principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the army and the people, as well as democratic life, abolition of corporal punishment, leniency towards prisoners, and strict mass discipline in the Red Army. This made the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at that time a completely new type of army.

On the issue of fighting the enemy, Comrade Mao Zedong stipulated strategies and tactics for each period: during the period of guerrilla warfare, he put forward the famous sixteen-character formula: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." The direction of development is to take a defensive posture against a powerful enemy and an offensive posture against the enemy's weak points. The method is wave-like advancement and concentrated attack on the enemy. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the strategic policy of the Eighth Route Army was determined as: "Basic guerrilla warfare, but do not abandon mobile warfare under favorable conditions," and he wrote the brilliant masterpiece "On Protracted War." This book pointed out the direction and methods of struggle for the people of the whole country, politically proposed to adhere to resistance, adhere to unity, and adhere to progress, and militarily proposed to change from the enemy's attack to a stalemate to a certain extent, and then to change to the enemy's defeat and our victory. The Chinese people and their army won the victory based on this scientific guidance. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the principle of "avoiding unfavorable decisive battles first, and seeking decisive battles when the situation is favorable" was put forward, and the policy of annihilating the enemy within the interior line was adopted; when the situation was unfavorable, a part of the territory and even many important cities were resolutely abandoned to implement strategic retreat; in each retreat, the aim was to annihilate one route of the enemy, not to maintain or capture cities, but to annihilate the enemy's living forces; not defensive warfare, but mobile warfare. This weakened and dispersed the enemy, gaining the initiative to facilitate the annihilation of the enemy. When the situation of the enemy and ourselves changed, we concentrated our forces to seize cities. When the situation of the enemy and ourselves fundamentally changed, we used military offensives combined with political efforts to liberate cities peacefully. Thus, we finally won the great victory of the whole country.

After twenty-five years of severe war testing, it has been proved that the military line of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong is completely correct. In order to summarize these experiences, Comrade Mao Zedong also has many famous military works, such as: "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War," "Strategic Problems in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War," etc. These works discuss the causes, nature, principles, strategic thought, laws of war, and even tactical issues, attack-defense relations, and political work, and criticize military "left" and right opportunism and dogmatism.

Comrade Mao Zedong's military science is the militarized science of Marxism-Leninism in China. This is the valuable property of the Chinese people, especially the People's Liberation Army, and a magic weapon for victory. We should study and research it well to improve our military qualities so as to more effectively carry out the task of defending our great motherland, preventing and crushing any provocations by American imperialism and its accomplices armed with the latest modern technology, as well as the crazy attempt to expand the war and invade our country, and dominate the world. Therefore, we must step up the building of a modern and powerful national defense force, and take a step forward from the existing foundation. To this end, in addition to stepping up the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's military science, summarizing the experience of twenty-five years of war, and learning from the current experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting American imperialism, we need to learn from the Soviet Union's valuable war experience in building its army and crushing internal and external enemies over the past thirty-five years, especially the valuable experience of the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War. Comrade Bulganin said in his speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "This war proves that the Soviet army is an army with very modern equipment, well-trained commanding personnel, and unparalleled morale and combat qualities. This war has more forcefully proved that our army is a new type of army, a truly people's army, an army that demonstrates the brotherly friendship of all nationalities in our country, and an army that has been nurtured in the spirit of internationalism. This war further proves that the personnel of our army are strong because they firmly believe in the justice of the war that our country has had to wage and have a high degree of political consciousness, which, as everyone knows, is of great significance in guaranteeing victory." The modernized national defense force we want to build should take the Soviet army as the standard. The reason why they succeeded in building the army and won great victories is, as Comrade Bulganin said: "These victories are the concrete manifestation of Soviet military art, the masterpiece of Soviet officers and generals, the victory of Stalin's military science, and the strategic art of our leader and supreme commander Comrade Stalin." Therefore, if we want to build a good national defense force, we need to work hard to learn the advanced Soviet military science—Stalin's military science. For twenty-five years, since the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army—the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—we have been learning from the Soviet Red Army in terms of the construction of the army itself, tactics, and political work. Especially Comrade Mao Zedong, as early as 1929, stipulated that Marxism-Leninism should be studied in the army and learn from the Soviet Red Army. Therefore, our own construction has made rapid progress; and now, arming ourselves with Stalin's military science is even more urgent. But we are not learning enough now.

(III)

The Soviet Red Army, starting from a very small and scattered Red Guard in 1917, has been tempered into the strongest armed force in the world today through several extremely severe tests, making socialist Soviet Union a strong fortress for defending world peace. This victory of the Soviet Red Army is also the victory of Lenin and Stalin's cause, and the victory of Stalin's military science.

When the proletariat of the October Socialist Revolution overthrew the rule of the Tsar and established the first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Red Army suppressed many rebellions by domestic counter-revolutionaries. During the domestic war of 1918-21, under the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Red Army repelled the attack of German imperialism and crushed the armed intervention of fourteen imperialist countries including the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy, saving the socialist motherland from a serious war environment. In peacetime, the Soviet Red Army improved the quality of the army and improved the level of military science of the commanding personnel, making the Red Army the most advanced army in the world. Especially after several Stalin Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union established a strong heavy industry and national defense industry, improved the equipment of the Red Army, and made the Red Army the strongest iron team. When the Chinese warlords provoked the Soviet Union and Japanese imperialism provoked Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan, they were crushed. In the struggle to defend the Soviet border, it successfully liberated West Belarus and West Ukraine, crushed the Mannarin Line and the Finnish White Bandit Army, and liberated the Baltic coastal countries; especially in the Second World War, the Soviet Army won the victory of the Great Patriotic War, defeated fascist Germany, crushed Hitler's "blitzkrieg," and liberated Eastern European countries; in the East, it defeated Japanese imperialism, which almost enslaved the entire Asia, and liberated the Northeast and northern Korea. These great victories of the Soviet Army not only defended the socialist motherland, but also rescued mankind from the oppression of German, Japanese, and Italian fascism. Comrade Bulganin said: "During the war, the Soviet Army, under the leadership of their glorious commanders, won many brilliant victories, which our people should be proud of" (speaking at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union). Now, the Soviet Army is still vigilantly watching the intrigues of the instigators of war.

The achievements of the Soviet Army under the guidance of Comrade Stalin's military science have been hailed and admired by progressive mankind all over the world. As Comrade Stalin said at the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "The representatives of the fraternal parties expressed their admiration for the courage and success of our party, and gave our party the title of 'shock team' of the world workers' movement. They expressed their hope that the success of this 'shock team' would alleviate the suffering of the people of all countries groaning under the oppression of capitalism. I think our party has not failed this hope, especially during the Second World War, the Soviet Union crushed the fascist tyranny of Germany and Japan, freeing the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement."

Stalin's military science is based on Marxism-Leninism, born with the working class gaining power, and developed and consolidated in the socialist national construction through several serious wars. Comrade Voroshilov said at the celebration of Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday: "Stalin's military science is a systematic system of truly scientific knowledge of all comprehensive modern warfare issues. In addition to purely military factors - strategy, operational technology, tactics, troop formation and training, it also includes the sum of socio-political, economic and spiritual factors that have mutual combination, interaction and decisive influence on the entire military." Comrade Stalin pointed out that the factors that determine the fate of war that are always effective are: "The consolidation of the rear, the morale of the army, the quantity and quality of divisions, the equipment of the troops, and the organizational ability of the army commanders." Obviously, in modern warfare, without the consolidation of the rear, the army cannot win the battle. Similarly, without high morale and highly mechanized equipment, it is impossible to ultimately defeat the enemy. But with these, without the skillful military command combined with personal courage, it is impossible to win. The Soviet army has the wise commander Stalin and the guidance of many excellent generals, which is one of the major factors why they were able to win the victory of the Great Patriotic War.

The Soviet military art is divided into three parts: strategic, campaign, and tactical art, and the three are organically unified. The most important task of strategy is to determine the main attack direction and formulate the means and methods to achieve the purpose of the war according to each stage of the war; the most important task of campaign art is to determine the forms and methods of combat that are prepared for strategic victory at a certain stage of the war and with a high degree of certainty based on the guidance of the strategy; and tactics are subordinate to campaign art and through it to strategic art. In ensuring the victory of the war, Stalin's military science emphasizes scientific army political work, emphasizes spiritual factors and political leadership, organization, etc., to ensure the victory of the war.

Stalin's military science has its extremely rich content. Today, when we are building a regularized and modernized national defense force, we should study it well.

(IV)

Comrade Mao Zedong's and Comrade Stalin's military science are both guided by the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and are valuable experiences and scientific theories summarized based on the specific social environment and struggle situation with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism. The two are completely consistent. If we do not study Comrade Mao Zedong's and Comrade Stalin's military science well, we cannot improve and cannot adapt to the needs of future and current tasks. Although our comrades are paying attention to learning now, there are still two incorrect understandings that hinder this learning. The first is that some veteran comrades have narrow empiricism, thinking that they are enough, satisfied with past achievements, and unable to consciously accept new things, thus neglecting learning. This is the main danger. The other is the remnants of bourgeois military thought, which hinders the absorption of new ideas. The history of war has proved that the Soviet system is superior to the capitalist system, and socialist military science is superior to bourgeois military science. The most obvious example is that Germany, Japan, and Italy have been crushed by the Soviet Red Army under the guidance of Stalin's military science. Comrade Stalin once said that Germany had launched two bloody wars in the past thirty years and failed, not by accident, not only the entire Germany, but even its military thought was crushed at the same time. Therefore: "It is ridiculous to learn lessons from Clausewitz now." Germany is still like this, what value does the old Chinese "military science" of semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, which was already crushed by the People's Liberation Army under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military science, have? In the future, we must severely criticize these two incorrect ideas, step up the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's military science, and at the same time launch the study of Stalin's military science, learn the scientific army political work in the Soviet Red Army, in order to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and rapidly build a powerful, regularized, and modernized national defense force, so that we can complete the task in the sacred cause of defending the motherland, and can complete the task in the glorious cause of defending the safety and lasting peace of the Far East and the world. If American imperialism dares to provoke and attempt to expand the war, we will resolutely eliminate it.

    学习斯大林毛泽东的军事科学加速建设现代化国防军
    东北军区政治部主任　莫文骅
   （一）
    学习了斯大林同志的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”及苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件，使我对目前政治形势有了概括的认识。第二次世界大战以后这一时期是世界资本主义体系进一步削弱和和平民主与社会主义力量日益壮大的时期。资本主义各国争夺市场的斗争和力求击破自己竞争对方的愿望，在实际上比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈，因此斯大林同志得出结论说：
    “资本主义国家间战争的不可避免性是仍然存在的。”这一科学的论断是完全正确的。但是我们不能因此而发生错觉，以为资本主义阵营与和平民主阵营的矛盾就不重要了，他们之间的战争就可以完全避免了。如果这样想，就会使我们产生麻痹、松懈保卫祖国的战斗意志。这是十分有害的。
    帝国主义要获得最高利润的重要办法之一，是以战争的手段去掠夺其他国家人民特别是落后国家的人民。目前正在进行的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，美、法帝国主义在越南所进行的侵略战争，以及美帝国主义侵占我台湾的罪行等，都显示了帝国主义对人民民主国家的疯狂侵略，并没有因其内部矛盾而放松；相反却是企图发动对和平民主阵营的侵略以“缓和”其内部的冲突。美国新任总统艾森豪威尔上台后叫嚣扩大朝鲜战争就是明显露骨的例证。这便不能不引起我们严重的警惕，不能不把抗美援朝、保家卫国的任务进一步加强起来。
    伟大的祖国解放三年来，由于伟大领袖毛泽东同志的正确领导，进行了一系列的社会改革运动，使各民族、各党派更进一步的团结，人民民主统一战线更加巩固，经济得到迅速的恢复和发展，争取了抗美援朝的伟大胜利。然而，帝国主义是仇视这些改革和胜利的，他们还要千方百计地想法破坏这些胜利，因此，为了保卫祖国的安全，“中华人民共和国应加强现代化的陆军，并建设空军和海军，以巩固国防。”（共同纲领第二十二条）近三年来，在这方面我们已有了很大成就。但离任务与要求还是很远的。像苏联那样强大的国家，在联共第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志还提出：“警惕地注意战争挑拨者的阴谋。用一切方法加强苏联陆军、海军和情报机构。”那么，对年轻的我们的祖国来说，这一任务就更为迫切了。
        （二）
    中国人民解放军建军二十五年来，一直是在毛泽东同志的组织和领导下，经过了长期的革命战争的考验，逐步发展、壮大起来的，到今天已成为一支可靠的捍卫祖国的力量，人民民主政权和世界和平的有力柱石。所有这些都是与毛泽东同志军事思想的指导分不开的。
    毛泽东同志科学的军事思想，是产生在半封建、半殖民地的中国，是马克思、列宁主义军事科学在中国革命具体实践中的进一步的发展。根据中国革命的特点和需要，毛泽东同志一向就非常重视革命的武装斗争。早在一九二七年“湖南农民运动考察报告”中，毛泽东同志就主张“推翻地主武装，建立农民武装”。当第一次国内革命战争失败后，党转入农村领导农民进行游击战争，一九二八年毛泽东同志在给党中央的报告中也说：“以农业为主要经济的中国革命，以军事发展暴动，是一个特征。我们建议中央，用大力做军事运动。”一九三九年在“‘共产党人’发刊词”中更明确地指出：“……在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”由于他重视了武装斗争，以马克思、列宁主义的科学方法，系统地分析了客观现实环境，预见革命发展前途，有计划地、有步骤地提出了一系列的建军方针、战略战术、战争原理，以争取革命胜利，将一个半封建、半殖民地的国家，变为新民主主义国家。
    毛泽东同志的军事路线和他的政治路线一样是一贯完全正确的。在一九二八年那种艰苦困难的游击战争环境里，部分同志怀疑小块红色政权的存在，提出“红旗能打多久”时，毛泽东同志就将国内外形势，敌我形势作了深刻的分析，肯定地答复：小块红色政权能够存在；并且指出“中国是全国都布满了干柴，很快就会燃成烈火。”“星星之火，可以燎原”的。现在全国的胜利，证明了这个天才的科学预见。
    毛泽东同志的建军思想同样是杰出的。在一九二九年红四军第九次党代表大会决议中，毛泽东同志即英明地提出：建军着重在思想建设，党的建设与政治工作建设，即加强共产党在军队中的领导作用；同时具体规定了红军的三大任务：打仗、筹款、做群众工作；还规定了红军中官兵一致，军民一致原则，以及民主生活，废除肉刑，宽待俘虏及严格群众纪律等。这就使当时的工农红军成为一支完全新型的军队。
    在对敌斗争问题上，毛泽东同志每个时期规定了战略战术：当进行游击战争的时期，他提出了有名的十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”发展方向是对强大的敌人取守势，对敌人薄弱方向取攻势。方式是波浪式推进及集中打击敌人。抗日战争时期，确定了第八路军的战略方针为：“基本的游击战，但不放弃有利条件下的运动战”，并写了辉煌的巨著：“论持久战”。这本书指出了全国人民斗争的方向及办法，在政治上提出了坚持抗战，坚持团结，坚持进步，在军事上则提出了由敌人进攻而变化到一定程度的相持，再变化到敌败我胜。中国人民及其军队是根据这一科学指导而获得胜利的。第三次国内革命战争时期，则提出了“先避不利的决战，待至有利之情况好求决战”的原则，采取内线歼敌的方针；当情况不利时，决然断然地放弃一部分领土以至许多重要城市，实行战略退却；在每次退却时，求得歼敌一路，不是以保持或夺取城市为主，而以歼灭敌人有生力量为主；不是防御战，而是运动战。这样削弱与分散敌人，争取主动，以利于歼敌。当敌我形势改变后，则集中力量夺取城市，当敌我形势根本转变后，则用军事进攻结合政治争取以和平方式解放城市。如此最后争取了全国大胜利。
    经过了二十五年的严重战争的考验，证明了伟大领袖毛泽东同志的军事路线完全正确。为了总结这些经验，毛泽东同志还有许多军事名著，如：“中国革命战争的战略问题”，“抗日游击战争的战略问题”等。这些著作论述了战争的原因、性质、原理、战略思想、战争规律，以至战术问题、攻防关系及政治工作等，并批判了军事上的“左”、右倾机会主义及教条主义。
    毛泽东同志的军事科学是马克思、列宁主义中国化的军事科学。这是中国人民、特别是人民解放军的宝贵财产，是致胜法宝，我们应很好的学习、研究，以提高我们的军事素质，以便更有效地执行保卫我们伟大祖国的任务，防止并粉碎以现代最新技术武装起来的美帝国主义及其帮凶的任何挑衅，以及扩大战争侵略我国、独霸全世界的狂妄企图。因此，我们必须加紧建设现代化强大国防军，从现有的基础上提高一步。为此，除了加紧学习毛泽东同志的军事科学，总结二十五年战争经验，学习目前抗击美帝国主义的中国人民志愿军的经验外，更需要学习苏联三十五年来的建军及粉碎内外敌人的宝贵的战争经验，特别是苏联伟大卫国战争的宝贵经验。布尔加宁同志在联共十九次代表大会上发言说：“这次战争证明，苏联的军队是一支拥有十分现代化的装备、久经锻炼的指挥人员以及无与伦比的士气和战斗品质的军队。这场战争更有力地证明了我们的军队是一支新型的军队，是一支真正的人民的军队，是一支表现了我国各民族兄弟友爱的军队，是一支以国际主义精神培育起来的军队。这次战争进一步证明了，我们军队的人员是坚强的，因为他们深信我们国家所不得不进行的战争的正义性，并且具有高度的政治觉悟，大家知道，这对保证胜利是有很大意义的。”我们要建设的现代化国防军，应以苏联军队为标准，他们之所以建军成功，之所以获得伟大的胜利，正如布尔加宁同志所说：“这些胜利都是苏联军事艺术的具体表现，苏联军官和将领的杰作，斯大林军事科学的胜利，我们的领袖和最高统帅斯大林同志的战略艺术的胜利。”因此，我们要把国防军建设的好，需要努力学习先进的苏联军事科学——斯大林的军事科学。二十五年来，自人民解放军的前身——工农红军起，无论是在军队本身的建设上、战术上、政治工作上都是向苏联红军学习的，特别毛泽东同志，早在一九二九年便规定了军队中要研究马克思列宁主义，向苏联红军学习。所以，使我们的自身建设上，有迅速的进步；而现在，以斯大林军事科学来武装自己，是更迫不容缓的了。可是我们现在却学得不够。
    （三）
    苏联红军从一九一七年一支数量极小而又分散的赤卫队起，三十五年来，经过多次极严重的考验已锻炼成为今天世界上最坚强的武装力量，使社会主义的苏联，成了保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。苏联红军的这种胜利，也就是列宁、斯大林事业的胜利，是斯大林的军事科学的胜利。
    当十月社会主义革命俄国无产阶级推翻了沙皇统治，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家后，苏联红军曾镇压了国内反革命的多次叛变。在一九一八—二一年的国内战争期间，红军在英明的列宁、斯大林领导之下，击退德帝国主义的进攻，并粉碎了美、英、法、日、意等十四个帝国主义国家的武装干涉，从严重的战争环境里，挽救了社会主义祖国。在和平时期，苏联红军改善了军队素质，提高了指挥人员军事科学的水平，使红军成为世界上最先进的军队。特别是经过几个斯大林五年计划，苏联建立了雄厚的重工业和国防工业，改善了红军的装备，使红军成为最坚强的铁的队伍。当中国军阀向苏联挑衅及日本帝国主义在张鼓峰、诺门坎挑衅时则被粉碎，在保卫苏维埃边境斗争中，胜利地解放了西别露西亚与西乌克兰，粉碎了曼那林防线及芬兰白匪军，解放了波罗的海沿岸诸国；特别在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队赢得了伟大卫国战争的胜利，击败了法西斯德国，粉碎了希特勒的“闪击战”，并解放了东欧各国；在东方则击败了几乎奴役整个亚洲的日本帝国主义，解放了东北和朝鲜北部。苏联军队的这些伟大胜利，不仅保卫了社会主义祖国，而且把人类从德、日、意法西斯的淫威压迫下拯救出来。布尔加宁同志说：“在战争期间，苏联军队在他们的光荣的指挥员的领导下获得了许多辉煌的胜利，这些胜利是我们的人民应当引以自豪的”（在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上发言）。现在，苏联军队还警惕地注意着战争挑拨者的阴谋。
    苏联军队在斯大林同志军事科学指导下所获得的成就受到了全世界进步人类的欢呼和崇敬，正如斯大林同志在联共十九次代表大会上所说的：“兄弟党的代表对我们党的勇敢和成功表示敬佩，给予我们党以世界工人运动‘突击队’的称号。他们以此表示希望这支‘突击队’的成功减轻在资本主义压迫下呻吟的各国人民的痛苦。我认为，我们党并没有辜负这种希望，特别是在第二次世界大战时间，苏联粉碎了德国和日本的法西斯暴政，使欧洲和亚洲的各国人民解脱了法西斯奴役的威胁。”
    斯大林的军事科学，是以马克思列宁主义为基础，随着工人阶级获得政权而诞生，并在社会主义的国家建设中，经过了若干严重的战争而发展和巩固起来的。伏洛希洛夫同志在庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰时说：“斯大林军事科学，是现代战争诸问题一切综合底真正科学知识底有系统的体系，除开纯军事的诸因素——战略、作战技术、战术、部队编制与训练外，还包括着对全体军事具有彼此结合，互相作用和决定影响的社会政治、经济和精神诸因素底总和。”斯大林同志指出，决定战争命运经常有效的因素为：“后方的巩固性，军队的士气，师团的数量与质量，部队的装备，军队长官的组织能力。”很显然，在近代化的战争中，没有后方的巩固，军队是不能打胜仗的。同样地没有高昂的士气、高度机械化的装备，也是不能最终地战胜敌人的。但有了这些，而没有与个人的勇敢相结合的巧妙的军事指挥也是不能胜利的，苏军有英明的统帅斯大林及许多优秀的将领的指导，就是他们所以能获得伟大卫国战争胜利的重大因素之一。
    苏军的军事艺术分三部分：战略、战役及战术的艺术，三者间是有机地统一着的。战略最重要的任务是根据战争的每个阶段来确定主攻方向和拟定达到战争目的的手段和方法；战役艺术最重要的任务是在于根据战略的指导，确定于战争某一阶段的及十分有把握地来准备战略胜利的作战形式及方法；而战术是服从于战役艺术的，并通过它来服从战略艺术。在保证战争胜利中，斯大林军事科学很强调科学的军队政治工作，强调精神因素及政治领导、组织等，以保证战争胜利。
    斯大林的军事科学，有其极其丰富的内容。当今我建设正规化现代化国防军的时候，应很好地学习它。（四）
    毛泽东同志与斯大林同志的军事科学都是以马克思、列宁主义的思想为指导原则，以辩证唯物论的观点根据具体社会环境与斗争情况总结起来的宝贵经验，科学理论，二者完全是一致的。如果没有很好学习毛泽东同志与斯大林同志的军事科学，则我们就不能提高，不能适应今后及当前任务的需要。现在我们同志中虽正在注意学习，但在学习中还有两种不正确的认识阻碍着这种学习。第一是有些老同志有狭隘经验主义，以为自己够了，满足于过去的成就，不能自觉地去接受新鲜事物，因而忽视了学习。这是主要的危险。另一种是存在着的资产阶级军事思想残余，阻碍了新思想的吸收。战争历史已经证明，苏维埃制度优越于资本主义制度，社会主义的军事科学优越于资产阶级的军事学，最明显的例证是德、日、意已被斯大林军事科学指导下的苏联红军粉碎了。斯大林同志曾经说过，近三十年来德国曾经发动两次流血战争都失败了，不是偶然的，不仅是整个德国，连它的军事思想也同时被粉碎了。因此：“现在从克劳塞维茨那里吸取教训是可笑的了。”德国尚且如此，半封建、半殖民地的旧中国那种早被毛泽东军事科学指导下的人民解放军粉碎了的、东抄西凑的“军事学”那还有什么价值呢？今后我们要严厉批判这两种不正确的思想，加紧对毛泽东同志的军事科学的学习，同时展开对斯大林军事科学的学习，学习苏联红军中科学的军队政治工作，以执行毛泽东同志的指示，迅速建设起强大的正规化的、现代化的国防军，以便在保卫祖国神圣事业上能完成任务，在保卫远东与世界人类安全与持久和平的光荣事业上，能完成任务。如果美帝国主义敢于挑衅妄图扩大战争，我们就坚决消灭它。
