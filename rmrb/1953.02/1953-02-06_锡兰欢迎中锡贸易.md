    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: The equal and mutually beneficial trade between China and Ceylon is widely welcomed in Ceylon.

    The "Ceylon Times" stated: "Bilateral trade with China, a country with enormous trade potential, is extremely beneficial to Ceylon. Sino-Ceylon trade not only provides Ceylon with a large amount of grain but also guarantees a vast sales market for Ceylon's products. It not only helps Ceylon solve its current difficulties but also promotes further mutual understanding between the two countries."

    According to Colombo newspapers, the trade agreement between China and Ceylon has improved Ceylon's rubber industry, which was on the verge of collapse, and saved 300,000 workers facing imminent unemployment. At the same time, Ceylon has obtained rice from China, which can solve the serious food shortage problem.

    The Ceylon government has decided to allocate funds to support a plan to reorganize the rubber industry. The fund for this plan comes from the special tax levied on rubber exported to China. The Ceylon government has also decided to use part of the profits from selling rubber to China as a fund to stabilize rubber prices. The "Low Country Products Association" (the lowlands are the rubber-producing areas of Ceylon) has requested the Minister of Commerce and Trade, Mr. Senerat, to ensure that the profits from selling rubber to China are specifically used as a fund to improve the rubber industry. Ceylon rubber merchants have welcomed the Sino-Ceylon rubber trade. More than two hundred Ceylon merchants and rubber traders have applied to the Ceylon government to sell rubber.

    According to the contract between the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Ceylon government for the sale of 80,000 tons of rice, 61,035 tons of rice have been shipped to Ceylon.

    锡兰欢迎中锡贸易
    【新华社新德里五日电】中国和锡兰之间进行的平等互利的贸易在锡兰受到广泛的欢迎。
    “锡兰时报”说：“和中国这样拥有巨大贸易潜力的国家进行双边贸易，对锡兰是极为有利的。中锡贸易不仅使锡兰获得大量粮食，而且保证锡兰产品得到广大的销售市场。它不但有助于锡兰解决当前的困难，而且还会促进两国间的进一步的相互了解。”
    据科伦坡报纸报道，中锡两国间的贸易协定签订后，已使锡兰濒于崩溃危机的橡胶业得到好转，并拯救了面临紧迫的失业威胁的三十万工人。同时，锡兰还从中国得到大米，可以解决严重的粮荒问题。
    锡兰政府已决定拨款支持重整橡胶业的计划。这个计划的基金来自对输往中国的橡胶所征得的特种税。锡兰政府还决定把卖橡胶给中国所得的利润的一部分作为稳定橡胶价格的基金。“低地产物联合会”（低地是锡兰产橡胶的地区）已经要求商务贸易部长沈纳那亚克设法保证把卖橡胶给中国所得到的利润，专门作为改善橡胶业的基金。锡兰橡胶商人对中锡橡胶贸易表示欢迎。两百多锡兰商人和橡胶商已向锡兰政府申请出售橡胶。
    根据中华人民共和国中央人民政府售给锡兰政府八万吨大米的合同，六万一千零三十五吨大米已运到了锡兰。
