    The construction in all aspects of our country is developing rapidly, but there are still many stumbling blocks on our path of development. The feudal marriage system is a large stumbling block that must be removed.
    Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, some areas have earnestly implemented the Marriage Law, relieving the suffering of the people, especially women, caused by the feudal, arranged, and mercenary marriage system. Many unhappy families that were constantly arguing have been transformed into democratic and harmonious happy families. The phenomena of lack of marriage freedom, gender inequality, and abuse of women, as well as incidents of death resulting from these issues, have become rare. People are filled with joy and vitality in their lives and production labor, leading to a more rapid increase in production. However, in many other areas, due to the ineffective implementation of the Marriage Law, arranged and mercenary marriages are still very prevalent, and marriage freedom is still subject to unreasonable interference. The phenomena of gender inequality and abuse of women are still widespread. This situation causes a large number of family lives to continue to be trapped in endless disputes and deep suffering, and production is also seriously affected. In particular, the vast majority of women are still enduring unimaginable mental and physical torment. In their struggle for marriage freedom and basic human rights, they are still subjected to the hatred of feudal ideas left over from thousands of years, and continue to suffer barbaric persecution and killing. According to incomplete statistics from the Central South region in the year before September 1951, as many as 10,000 women committed suicide or were killed due to lack of marriage freedom. In the first half of 1952 alone, statistics from 39 counties in Hunan Province showed that 606 women committed suicide or were killed. Zeng Shuichu, a woman from Lingui County, Guangxi, was beaten to death by her husband and clansmen because she wanted to participate in local revolutionary work, and her body was cut into several pieces. Peng Jiaxiu, a woman from Taojiang County, Hunan, was knocked unconscious by her husband with a wooden stick and then stabbed to death by her mother-in-law with a red-hot fire poker. Such barbaric and brutal methods are only legal in the manors of slave owners, in the prisons of feudal tyrants, and in the colonies trampled by imperialism, but in our new democratic country, they are completely intolerable serious crimes.
    Therefore, it has become a very urgent matter to launch a vigorous mass movement to implement the Marriage Law throughout the country, except for minority areas and areas where land reform has not yet been completed, to fundamentally destroy the feudal marriage system, to realize the new democratic marriage system, and to liberate millions of young and middle-aged men and women, especially women, from the shackles of the feudal marriage system. After the feudal political system and economic foundation have been eliminated, and after the land reform in rural areas and the democratic reform in urban factories and mines have been largely completed, the subjective and objective conditions for carrying out this movement are also fully mature. Now, the National Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law has been established, and various localities have begun to make preparations. The month of March this year will be launched as a propaganda and implementation movement for the Marriage Law. We must use great efforts to carry out this movement.
    The movement to implement the Marriage Law is a major social reform movement. From this point of view, it has the same important revolutionary significance as previous large-scale mass movements. But we must also see that the problem to be solved by this movement is basically an internal problem of the people. From this point of view, we should use our main energy to carry out propaganda and education among the people in the movement, so that they can fully understand the purpose of the Marriage Law through examples of the comparison between new and old marriages. In particular, we should introduce and commend examples of marriage freedom and family harmony, so that the masses can truly understand how to establish democratic and harmonious new families, turn unhappy families into happy families, improve interest in production, promote production and construction, and enable our descendants to grow into healthy people both physically and mentally. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it is necessary to thoroughly break the rumors or misunderstandings that "implementing the Marriage Law will cause chaos and family breakups," eliminate the remaining feudal ideas and various one-sided and erroneous understandings of the Marriage Law, so that the masses can consciously and voluntarily act in accordance with the Marriage Law. From this point of view, we should not adopt the practice in some areas of only mobilizing women and not men, only mobilizing young people and not the elderly, only mobilizing the poor and not the wealthy, or organizing women and young people to struggle against men and the elderly. Because this practice can only create division and alienation among the masses, deepen the masses' misunderstanding of the Marriage Law, and increase the resistance to the movement. In some areas, while mobilizing women, efforts should also be made to mobilize mothers-in-law and husbands to jointly accuse the feudal marriage of the suffering it has caused to people, jointly examine and criticize acts of interfering with marriage freedom and abusing women, jointly discuss how to implement the Marriage Law and realize democratic and harmonious families, and jointly formulate covenants to ensure that they act in accordance with the Marriage Law, practice mutual respect and love between husband and wife, family harmony and unity, jointly raise children, and develop production. For a large number of existing arranged marriages, education should generally be emphasized, feudal ideas should be opposed, family relationships should be improved, and old families should be transformed into democratic and harmonious new families. For those with bad family relationships, where one or both parties request a divorce, mediation should still be carried out as much as possible, so that those who can reconcile can reconcile again. However, if mediation is ineffective after repeated attempts, or if failure to allow a divorce would endanger the lives of the parties concerned, a divorce must be granted in accordance with the Marriage Law. Forced mediation is not allowed, so as not to cause lifelong pain or lead to suicide or murder. These principles should be explained clearly to the masses. For future marriages, it must be guaranteed that they are handled in accordance with the Marriage Law, and no arranged, forced, or interference with marriage freedom is allowed.
    For cases of violating the Marriage Law, such as interfering with marriage freedom, abusing and persecuting women, resulting in suicide or murder of women, serious and solemn handling must be carried out; important cases that were handled incorrectly in the past must be re-examined; and these examples should be used to educate the masses in an organized and planned manner through public trials or other means to expand the impact, so that the masses can specifically and comprehensively understand the Marriage Law and the policies of the Party and the People's Government. These measures are very important for carrying out the movement and implementing the Marriage Law. In the past, some areas did not seriously and solemnly handle marriage disputes and cases of violating the Marriage Law, which seriously dampened the enthusiasm and confidence of those fighting for marriage freedom and fueled the arrogance of those who interfered with marriage freedom and abused and persecuted women, resulting in continuous tragic incidents of women committing suicide or being killed. This situation must be quickly corrected by taking all effective measures, including punishing relevant cadres. However, punishment itself is not the goal; punishment is precisely to give the masses more practical education. Therefore, criminal penalties should only be imposed on a very small number of people who have committed serious crimes, caused serious consequences (such as incidents of women committing suicide or being killed), and aroused great public outrage. For general violations of the Marriage Law, such as those that have not caused serious consequences, as long as they have undergone in-depth exposure, criticism, and education, and the perpetrators express their determination to correct their mistakes, it is not necessary to impose legal penalties. Moreover, even the serious handling of important events must be combined with the propaganda work and organizational work in the movement to implement the Marriage Law in the vast urban and rural areas, so that this serious handling can be supported by the vast masses and achieve the effect of educating the masses. In the past, some areas understood the work of implementing the Marriage Law as simply handling marriage cases, and understood the movement to implement the Marriage Law as holding a few sensational public trial rallies, neglecting the arduous work of carrying out among the broad masses, so the role played by this kind of handling was very limited.
    In the entire mobilization work of the movement to implement the Marriage Law, mobilizing grassroots cadres is of particular importance. Because most of the work in this movement is to be done by grassroots cadres. But until now, a considerable part of the grassroots cadres still have feudal backward ideas such as patriarchal and paternal authority, and cannot accept the principles of marriage freedom and gender equality. Their attitude towards the Marriage Law is passive. They adopt a bureaucratic and irresponsible attitude towards various violations of the Marriage Law and phenomena of interfering with marriage freedom and abusing and persecuting women, ignoring reports, and even if they are reported, they ignore them, failing to save people in distress, and not asking questions even after death, and even adding false charges to those who fight for marriage freedom, arbitrarily setting conditions for divorce and marriage, holding meetings to criticize, and abusing penalties. This situation has greatly fueled some backward public opinion and the occurrence of incidents of violating the Marriage Law and persecuting women. These cadres should be patiently educated through methods such as collective training to overcome their feudal consciousness, so that they can recognize the role of the Marriage Law in promoting national construction and actively and proactively assume the responsibility of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. At present, a thorough ideological examination and reflection should be launched in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline to expose and solve various erroneous ideas and illegal acts. Cadres who have made general mistakes should be criticized, those who have made serious mistakes should be given certain punishments, and those who have made significant achievements in implementing the Marriage Law should be commended.
    Party and government leading organs at all levels should conduct universal mobilization among the vast number of cadres in various systems, closely cooperate, and coordinate to implement the Marriage Law and participate in this large-scale social reform movement. We require leading cadres and general staff members in the party, government, military, civilian, industrial, agricultural, youth, women, cultural, and educational systems to play a exemplary role and a leading role in implementing the Marriage Law under the unified leadership of the local party and government leading organs, to support this movement in public opinion, and to cooperate with this movement as much as possible in various practical work. That is to say, in all occasions where work in various departments comes into contact with the masses, attention should be paid to conducting publicity and explanation work on the Marriage Law to the surrounding masses, to understanding the implementation of the Marriage Law, to discovering problems, and to helping solve problems. In this way, the movement to implement the Marriage Law can be organically combined with production and construction, cultural education, party rectification, government construction, and the business and organizational construction work of various departments, promoting and enriching each other and completing them together. In the past, some areas carried out the implementation of the Marriage Law in isolation, and many departments believed that the implementation of the Marriage Law had nothing to do with them, and even some local organizations of the Communist Youth League and the trade union stood by, so the results were very small. This situation should be corrected by the local party and government leading organs in this movement.
    People have seen that many young people, especially women, are still suffering deeply and being savagely persecuted due to lack of marriage freedom. Some of them commit suicide or are killed as a result, dying unnaturally; another part will continue to have unfortunate events happen if they are not rescued urgently. Any Communist Party member and revolutionary worker, anyone who loves the people and loves the motherland, cannot be indifferent to such things. We have a full responsibility to eliminate this distressing phenomenon, first of all, to eliminate the phenomenon of people dying due to lack of marriage freedom. And to eliminate this phenomenon, we must first do a good job of publicizing the Marriage Law, eliminate the remnants of feudal ideas in people's minds, and change social customs. At the same time, local organizations must strongly support young men and women, especially women, who are fighting for marriage freedom. People's governments, women's federations, and Communist Youth Leagues at all levels should provide "bodyguards" to young men and women who are striving for marriage freedom under severe oppression, to ensure their safety and personal freedom. Temporary resettlement and necessary relief should be provided to women who encounter financial difficulties and life-threatening situations. This is a sacred responsibility that all revolutionary comrades should bravely and resolutely undertake.
    The movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law has been designated as the central task for March, and local party committees should actively prepare, make specific arrangements, and conscientiously lead it. Of course, implementing the Marriage Law and thoroughly eliminating the feudal marriage system is not a problem that can be solved by a short one-month movement. This movement involves such a wide range and such a short period of time, so we must also prevent impatience. During this movement month, we only require the following points to be achieved: First, conduct a universal publicity of the Marriage Law, striving to make it known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; Second, conscientiously check the implementation of the Marriage Law in various places, so that leaders have a clear understanding and the masses understand the seriousness of the problem; Third, vigorously commend some model figures and model villages with marriage freedom, family harmony, active production, and political progress, handle some of the most serious cases of destroying marriage freedom and women's rights, and resolve some marriage disputes that need to be resolved urgently in various places. During this large-scale mass movement, all localities must ensure that the phenomenon of people dying from marriage problems is stopped. After this movement, we must strive to generally correct the phenomenon of interfering with marriage freedom and abusing women; eliminate feudal malpractices such as arranged and mercenary marriages, early marriage, and child brides; and further create a good social atmosphere, so that people are generally willing to act in accordance with the Marriage Law and encourage young people to fight for marriage freedom. Finally, in this movement month, we must lay a mass foundation for the long-term implementation of the Marriage Law, so that in the future, in conjunction with the central work of various periods, we can continue to implement the Marriage Law, continue to fight for the elimination of the feudal marriage system, and continue to eliminate the remaining feudal consciousness in people's minds.

### 大力准备开展贯彻婚姻法的群众运动

    大力准备开展贯彻婚姻法的群众运动
    我们国家各方面的建设都在突飞猛进地向前发展，但是在我们发展的道路上还有很多绊脚石。封建的婚姻制度，就是一块很大的绊脚石，必须把它搬掉。
    自从中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布以来，有一部分地区由于认真地贯彻执行了婚姻法，解除了封建的包办买卖婚姻制度所加于人民群众特别是妇女群众的痛苦，使许多经常生气吵架的不幸家庭变成了民主和睦的幸福家庭，婚姻不自由、男女不平等、妇女受虐待的现象以及因此而死人的事件已很少发生，人们在生活和生产劳动中充溢着愉快和生趣，随之而来的是生产的更迅速增长。但是在另外许多地区，由于对婚姻法执行不力，包办买卖婚姻仍然很流行，婚姻自由仍然受着无理的干涉，男女不平等、妇女受虐待的现象仍然广泛地存在。这种情形，使大量的家庭生活继续陷于无止境的纠纷和深深的痛苦中，生产也受到严重的影响。尤其是广大妇女还在忍受着难于想像的精神上肉体上的折磨。她们为争取婚姻自由和一点起码的人权，仍然受到了几千年遗留下来的封建思想的仇恨，以致继续遭到野蛮的迫害和残杀。据中南区一九五一年九月份以前一年中不完全的统计，因婚姻不自由而自杀被杀的妇女达一万人。一九五二年上半年，仅湖南省三十九个县统计，自杀被杀的妇女即达六百零六人。广西临桂县妇女曾水初因为要参加当地革命工作，竟被丈夫和同族的人活活打死，尸体被砍成数段。湖南桃江县妇女彭葭秀，被丈夫用木棍打昏在地，又被婆婆用烧红的火钳刺死。这种野蛮残暴的手段，只有在奴隶主的庄园里，在封建暴君的监牢里，在帝国主义践踏下的殖民地里才是合法的，而在我们新民主主义的国家里，则是完全不能容忍的严重罪行。
    因此，在全国范围内除少数民族地区和土地改革尚未完成的地区以外，大张旗鼓地发动一个贯彻婚姻法的群众运动，从根本上摧垮封建主义的婚姻制度，实现新民主主义的婚姻制度，从封建婚姻制度束缚下解放千百万青壮年男女特别是妇女群众，就成了十分迫切的事情。而在封建主义的政治制度和经济基础已经消灭之后，在全国农村的土地改革和城市厂矿的民主改革已经大体胜利完成之后，开展这一运动的主观和客观的条件也完全成熟了。现在，全国贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已经成立，各地已开始作准备工作，在今年三月即将开展宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动月。我们必须用大力来开展这个运动。
    贯彻婚姻法的运动，是一个重大的社会改革运动。从这一点来说，它和历次大规模的群众运动有同样重要的革命意义。但我们必须同时看到：这一运动所要解决的问题，基本上是人民内部的问题。从这一点出发，我们在运动中就应该用主要的精力对人民群众进行宣传教育，使他们经过新旧婚姻对比的实例，充分了解婚姻法的目的。特别要介绍和表扬那些婚姻自由、家庭和睦的例子，使群众切实体会怎样建立民主和睦的新家庭，把不幸的家庭都变成幸福的家庭，提高生产兴趣，推进生产建设，并使我们的后代成长为身心健康的人。这是一方面。另一方面，要彻底打破所谓“实行婚姻法会使天下大乱，妻离子散”的谣言或误解，扫除残余的封建思想和对于婚姻法的各种片面的错误的认识，使群众自觉自愿地按照婚姻法办事。从这一点出发，我们就不应该采用某些地区只发动妇女、不发动男人，只发动青年、不发动老人，只发动穷苦者、不发动富裕者，或者是把妇女、青年组织起来向男人、老人进行斗争的做法。因为这种做法只能造成群众的分裂和隔阂，加深群众对婚姻法的误解，增加运动的阻力。还有一些地区应该与发动妇女同时，用大力发动婆婆和丈夫，共同控诉封建婚姻给与人们的痛苦，共同检查和批评干涉婚姻自由和虐待妇女的行为，共同讨论如何贯彻执行婚姻法和实现民主和睦家庭，共同订立保证按婚姻法办事、实行夫妻互敬互爱、家庭和睦团结、共同抚育子女和发展生产的公约。对于大量既成的包办婚姻，一般应强调教育，反对封建思想，搞好家庭关系，把旧家庭改变为民主和睦的新家庭。对其中家庭关系恶劣，一方或双方要求离婚的，仍然应该尽量调解，使可能和好的重新和好，但是如果再三调解无效的，或是如果不让离婚就会造成当事人生命危险的，就必须按照婚姻法，准予离婚，不许强迫调解，以免造成终身的痛苦或逼致自杀被杀。这种道理，应该给群众解释明白。对于今后的婚姻，必须保证按婚姻法办事，不允许有任何包办、强迫或干涉婚姻自由的情事发生。
    对于违犯婚姻法的案件，如干涉婚姻自由、虐待与迫害妇女，以致造成妇女自杀或被杀的案件，必须作认真严肃的处理；过去处理错了的重要案件，必须重新处理；并应采取公开审判或其他的方式，有组织有计划地用这些实例教育群众，扩大影响，使群众具体地全面地了解婚姻法，了解党和人民政府的政策。这些措施，对于开展运动和贯彻执行婚姻法是十分重要的。过去有些地区因为没有认真严肃地处理婚姻纠纷和违犯婚姻法的案件，曾经严重地打击了争取婚姻自由者的斗争热情和信心，助长了干涉婚姻自由和虐待、迫害妇女者的气焰，因而妇女自杀被杀的惨痛事件不断发生。这种情形必须采取一切有效办法，包括惩处有关干部的办法，予以迅速纠正。但是，惩罚本身并不是目的，惩罚正是为了给群众以更实际的教育。因此，判处刑事处分的，就只能是极少数犯有严重罪行，造成严重后果（如发生妇女自杀被杀事件），以至民愤很大的分子。对于一般性质的违反婚姻法事件，如未造成严重后果的，则只要经过深刻的揭发批判和教育，犯错误者表示决心改正，即可不必实行法律处分。而且，即使是对重要事件的严肃处理，也必须和广大城乡贯彻婚姻法运动中的宣传工作、组织工作相结合，使这种严肃处理能为广大群众所支持，并收到教育群众的效果。过去有些地区把贯彻婚姻法的工作了解为单纯的处理婚姻案件的工作，把贯彻婚姻法的运动了解为召开几个轰轰烈烈的公审大会，忽略了在广大群众中进行艰苦的工作，因而这种处理所起的作用是很有限的。
    在贯彻婚姻法运动的整个动员工作中，动员基层干部有着特别的重要性。因为这一运动中的大部分工作，是要基层干部来做的。但是至今为止，基层干部中仍然有相当大的一部分人残存着夫权、父权等封建落后思想，不能接受婚姻自由和男女平等的原则。他们对待婚姻法的态度是消极的，被动的。他们对于各种违犯婚姻法和干涉婚姻自由、虐待与迫害妇女的现象，采取官僚主义和不负责任的态度，不告不理，告也不理，见死不救，死了也不问，甚至给争取婚姻自由的人乱加罪名，乱订离婚结婚条件，开会斗争，滥施刑罚。这种情形，大大地助长了某些落后舆论，助长了违犯婚姻法和迫害妇女事件的发生。对于这些干部，应该用集训等方式进行耐心的教育，克服他们的封建意识，使他们认识婚姻法对于推进国家建设的作用，积极主动地担负起宣传和贯彻婚姻法的责任。目前就应该结合反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，发动一次深入的思想检查和反省，暴露和解决各种错误思想和犯法行为。对一般犯有错误的干部应该批评，错误严重的应给以一定的处分，对执行婚姻法有显著成绩的应给予表扬。
    各级党政领导机关都应该在各系统广大干部中进行普遍的动员，密切配合，协同贯彻婚姻法，参加这一个大规模的社会改革运动。我们要求党、政、军、民、工、农、青、妇、文化教育各系统的领导干部和一般工作人员，在当地党和政府领导机关的统一领导下，都能在执行婚姻法上起模范作用，带头作用，在舆论上支持这一运动，在各项实际工作上尽可能配合这一运动。这就是说，在各部门工作与群众接触的场合，都要注意向周围群众进行关于婚姻法的宣传解释工作，注意了解婚姻法执行的情况，发现问题，并帮助解决问题。这样，贯彻婚姻法的运动就能够与生产建设、文化教育、整党、建政以及各部的业务和组织建设工作有机地结合起来进行，互相推动，互相充实，共同完成。过去有些地区把贯彻婚姻法孤立起来进行，许多部门都认为贯彻婚姻法与自己无关，甚至连青年团和工会的一些地方组织也袖手旁观，结果成效就很小。这种情形，应该由当地党政领导机关在这次运动中加以纠正。
    人们都看到有许多青年群众，特别是妇女群众，至今因婚姻不自由仍受着深重的痛苦和野蛮的迫害。其中一部分因此而自杀被杀，死于非命；另一部分如果不去急救，不幸事件仍会继续发生。任何一个共产党员和革命工作人员，任何一个热爱人民、热爱祖国的人，对这样的事情是不能漠不关心的。我们有完全的责任来消灭这种令人痛心的现象，首先是消灭因婚姻不自由而死人的现象。而要消灭这种现象，就必须首先做好婚姻法的宣传工作，扫除人们的封建思想残余，转变社会风气。同时，各地方组织对于为婚姻自由而斗争的青年男女特别是妇女必须大力支持。各级人民政府、妇联、青年团应该给在严重压迫下争取婚姻自由的青年男女“保镖”，保证她们的生命安全和人身自由。对其中遭遇生活困难和生命危险的妇女要实行临时安置和必要的救济。这是一切革命工作同志都应该勇敢地坚决地担负起来的神圣责任。
    宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动已被规定为三月份的中心工作，各地党委应当积极准备，具体布置，认真领导。当然，贯彻婚姻法、彻底肃清封建婚姻制度，决不是短短一个月的运动就能解决问题的。这个运动牵连的范围这样广，时间又是这样短促，所以我们也必须防止急躁情绪。在这个运动月当中，我们只要求做到以下几点：第一，进行一次普遍的婚姻法的宣传，务期作到家喻户晓，深入人心；第二，认真检查一次婚姻法在各地执行的情况，使领导人心中有数，也使群众了解问题的严重；第三，大张旗鼓地表扬一些婚姻自由、家庭和睦、生产积极、政治进步的模范人物和模范乡村，处理一些最严重的摧残婚姻自由和妇女权利案件，并解决各地急待解决的一些婚姻纠纷。在这个大规模的群众运动的期间，各地必须保证制止因婚姻问题而死人的现象。经过这个运动以后，我们必须争取一般地纠正干涉婚姻自由与虐待妇女的现象；破除包办买卖婚姻、早婚、童养媳等封建陋习；更进一步造成良好的社会风气，使一般人都愿意按照婚姻法办事，鼓励青年人为婚姻自由而斗争。最后，在这次运动月中，我们要打下长期贯彻婚姻法的群众基础，以便在今后结合各时期的中心工作，继续贯彻婚姻法、继续为肃清封建婚姻制度、继续清除人民思想中残余的封建意识而斗争。
