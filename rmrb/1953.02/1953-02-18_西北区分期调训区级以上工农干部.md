    The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions in December of last year on improving the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres at the district level and above. The instructions stated: In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over national construction, Party cadres, especially leading cadres, need not only a certain level of political understanding but also must have cultural knowledge to master certain professional skills. However, among the existing cadres in the Northwest, approximately 40,000 have a cultural level of primary school or below, of which more than 2,000 are at the district level and above. Most of these district-level and above cadres are worker-peasant cadres who have undergone relatively long periods of struggle. In the past, due to the war environment or being busy with social reforms, it was impossible for them to systematically study culture. Therefore, they are already experiencing the pain of being unable to cope with their current work, and it will be even more difficult for them to adapt to the needs of future work. For example, among the more than 1,000 district-level and above cadres transferred to economic construction in the Northwest this year, 108 could not be selected due to cultural limitations. This not only affects the upward mobility and enthusiasm of these cadres but also makes it easy for some cadres to have some erroneous views on the large-scale training of cadres in the future. Therefore, systematically improving the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres has become an urgent task for the Party in the current cadre training work. The Northwest Bureau has put forward a plan to improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres at the district level and above. This plan stipulates that in addition to the general worker-peasant cadres being improved batch by batch through worker-peasant rapid middle schools, cultural supplementary schools, and rapid supplementary schools, the cultural improvement of these more than 2,000 worker-peasant cadres at the district level and above will be handled by the Northwest Region and the Party Schools and cadre schools of each province, which will add worker-peasant cadre cultural classes. Starting in March of this year, cadres will be transferred for study in stages to solve this problem. According to the existing experience in national cadre cultural studies, efforts will be made to raise the existing cultural level to the junior middle school graduation level within two years. The first batch of district-level and above cadres to be transferred for cultural studies is tentatively set at 800. This includes 120 cadres entering the Northwest Party School, who are county party secretaries, county heads, and worker-peasant cadres of the Party at a level equivalent to this; 150 cadres entering the Northwest People's Revolutionary University; and 530 cadres entering the Party Schools and cadre schools of each province, all of whom are worker-peasant cadres at the level of department and section chiefs of counties, district party secretaries, and district heads. In terms of curriculum, the main subjects are Chinese language, mathematics, and general knowledge of natural science. The political courses will focus on Party history, the theory and policies of economic construction, and current events and policies. In terms of the proportion of courses, cultural courses should account for three-quarters, and political courses should not exceed one-quarter.

    西北区分期调训区级以上工农干部
    去年十二月，中共中央西北局发出了关于提高区级以上工农干部文化水平的指示。指示中说：为了加强党对国家各项建设的领导，党的干部特别是领导干部，不仅需要一定的政治水平，而且必须具有掌握一定业务的文化知识。但目前西北现有干部中约四万余名属初小以下文化程度，其中区级以上者即占两千余名。这些区级以上的干部大部是经过较长期斗争的工农干部，过去由于战争环境或忙于社会改革，不可能系统地学习文化，因此他们在目前工作中已有力不胜任的苦恼，而对今后工作上的需要也更难以适应。如今年西北抽调转入经济建设的千多名区级以上干部中，即有一百零八名因文化限制未能选用。这样不但影响了这些干部的上进心与积极性，也使某些干部对今后大量培养干部容易产生若干错误的看法。因此有计划地提高工农干部的文化水平，已成为党在当前培养干部工作上刻不容缓的任务。西北局提出了提高区级以上工农干部文化水平的计划。这一计划规定除一般工农干部由工农速成中学、文化补习学校及速成补习学校分批逐次提高外，对区级以上的这两千多名工农干部的文化提高问题，由西北区与各省党校、干部学校增设工农干部文化班次，在今年三月开始，分期调学，达到解决。并按全国干部文化学习中已有的经验，争取于两年内在现有文化基础上提高到初中毕业程度。第一期调学文化的区级以上干部，初步确定为八百名。计入西北党校一百二十名，为县委书记、县长及相当此级之党员工农干部；入西北人民革命大学一百五十名，入各省党校、干部学校五百三十名，皆为县的部、科长及区委书记、区长级之工农干部。在课程方面，主要是语文、数学与自然科学常识等项，政治课以党史、经济建设的理论与政策及时事政策为主。在课程比重上，文化课要占四分之三，政治课不得超过四分之一。
