Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd: The German News Agency, DPA, Berlin, reported on the 23rd that the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanding the revocation of the death sentence against the innocent Rosenberg couple.

The telegram stated: "The International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 135 million women in 65 countries, denounces your decision to allow the Rosenbergs to be executed by electric chair. This is a measure that violates all justice and disregards all demands and opinions of billions of people around the world who are trying to rescue them. Women around the world believe that this behavior is part of an act of creating war that threatens their lives and happiness. We demand the revocation of this death sentence."

The telegram was signed by Madame Gordon, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: Upright people from all over the world continue to protest the Eisenhower government's murder of innocent American citizens, the Rosenbergs.

In the German Democratic Republic, the Central Executive Committee of the "Association of Victims of Nazism," representing all resistance fighters, telegraphed the U.S. Department of Justice, saying: "We, the surviving victims of Fascism, the witnesses of the atrocities of Fascist executioners, and the fighters against Fascist barbarism, in the name of justice, angrily demand that you listen to the protests of upright people all over the world against the planned murder of the innocent Rosenberg couple."

In West Germany, women in Stuttgart held a one-hour protest demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate, and sent a delegation to petition the U.S. Consulate, demanding the revocation of the anti-humanitarian decision to execute the Rosenbergs. People in the Altona and Wandsbek districts of Hamburg held torchlight processions and protest rallies, demanding the immediate restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom. Dusseldorf sculptor Karl Nollen expressed serious protest against the Eisenhower government's deliberate murder of the Rosenbergs in the name of an ordinary German.

On the 16th and 17th, peace advocates in Berlin distributed leaflets near the U.S. military headquarters in West Berlin and on the streets of the Neukölln working-class district, calling on the people of West Berlin to work to save the Rosenbergs.

The wave of protests has also spread to the African continent. At the annual meeting of the South African Indian Congress, attendees passed a resolution to send a telegram to Eisenhower demanding the revocation of the death sentence imposed on the Rosenbergs.

In the United States, Americans who uphold justice have been holding demonstrations in front of the White House day and night after Eisenhower rejected the Rosenbergs' appeal. On the 23rd, they held a prayer meeting of hundreds of people on the sidewalk. At the meeting, an appeal was passed, pointing out that there was a "very widespread suspicion" throughout the world that the Rosenbergs' trial was not conducted according to the principle of "certain protections guaranteed to the accused American citizen by law." The appeal demanded that Eisenhower reconsider his decision to reject the revocation of the death sentence against the Rosenbergs. The "National Committee for Fair Trial of the Rosenberg Case" organized a petition movement demanding the restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom. On the 23rd, thousands of petitioners had departed from Manhattan, New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey, and then traveled to Washington in a train consisting of sixteen special cars to petition. The petitioners said: They demand to meet with President Eisenhower and members of Congress, demand the revocation of the death sentence against the Rosenbergs, and demand the immediate restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom.

    各国人民继续抗议美国政府谋害罗森堡夫妇
    国际民主妇联致电艾森豪威尔要求撤销这一可耻的判决
    【新华社二十四日讯】德意志通讯社柏林二十三日讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会致电美国总统艾森豪威尔，要求撤销对无辜的罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决。
    电文说：“国际民主妇女联合会代表六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女斥责你容许以电刑处死罗森堡夫妇的决定。这是违反一切正义和蔑视全世界营救他们的亿万人民的一切要求与意见的措施。全世界妇女认为这种行为是威胁他们的生命与幸福的制造战争的行为的一部分。我们要求撤销这一死刑判决。”
    电报由国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人署名。
    【新华社二十五日讯】世界各国正直人民继续抗议艾森豪威尔政府谋害无辜的美国公民罗森堡夫妇。
    在德意志民主共和国，“受纳粹之害者协会”中央执行委员会代表抵抗运动的全体战士致电美国司法部说：“我们还活着的法西斯主义受害者，我们法西斯刽子手暴行的目击者，我们反对法西斯野蛮主义的战士，以正义的名义，愤怒地要求你们听从举世正直人民反对计划谋杀无辜的罗森堡夫妇的抗议。”
    在西德，斯图加特的妇女在美国领事馆前举行一小时的抗议示威，并派出代表团向美国领事馆请愿，要求撤销处死罗森堡夫妇的反人道决定。汉堡阿尔托那区与文斯贝克区的人民举行了火炬游行和抗议大会，要求立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。西德杜塞尔多夫雕刻家康伦那以一个普通德国人的名义对艾森豪威尔政府蓄意杀害罗森堡夫妇表示严重的抗议。
    柏林的和平拥护者十六日和十七日在西柏林美军总部附近与新科隆工人区的街道上散发小册子，号召西柏林人民为拯救罗森堡夫妇而努力。
    抗议的浪潮也扩展到非洲大陆。在南非印度人大会举行的年会上，到会的人通过了一项决议，决定打电报给艾森豪威尔要求撤销蛮横地加在罗森堡夫妇身上的死刑判决。
    在美国国内，维护正义的美国人民在艾森豪威尔拒绝了罗森堡夫妇的上诉后夜以继日地在白宫门前举行示威游行。二十三日，他们在人行道上举行了数百人的祈祷会。在会上通过了一个呼吁书，呼吁书指出在全世界都存在着“极为普遍的怀疑”，怀疑罗森堡的审判是按照“法律上所规定的给与被告的美国公民以一定的保护”这个原则进行的。呼吁书要求艾森豪威尔重新考虑拒绝撤销对罗森堡夫妇死刑判决的决定。“争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会”组织了要求恢复罗森堡夫妇自由的请愿运动。在二十三日，成千的请愿人已从纽约的曼哈顿出发，到新泽西州的泽西城，然后乘坐十六辆专车组成的列车赴华盛顿请愿，请愿的人说：他们要求会见艾森豪威尔总统和国会议员，要求撤销对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决，要求立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。
