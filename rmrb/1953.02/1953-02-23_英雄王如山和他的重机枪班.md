Hero King Rushan and His Heavy Machine Gun Platoon
    Gong Jiemin
    In a certain company where Liu Genquan, a second-class combat hero of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, was stationed, there was a heavy machine gun platoon. When defending the 572.4 Highland east of the Beihan River, this platoon, in coordination with the artillery and neighboring squads, killed more than 200 soldiers of the Li pseudo-army's Third Division. The soldiers called their machine gun their "indestructible treasure gun."

    On the evening of September 29th last year, after our army completely occupied this highland, the enemy launched a frenzied and continuous counterattack. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Zhimin received an order from his superiors to place the heavy machine gun in the depression between positions No. 3 and No. 4. This was the main focus of the enemy's attack and could directly block them. Platoon Leader Wang Rushan knew that this task was very important, so he divided the entire platoon into two groups: Deputy Platoon Leader Zhao Mingzhong led one group to rush to repair fortifications using sacks left by the enemy, while Wang Rushan led the other group to guard the machine gun. Although Wang Rushan was only twenty-two years old, he was very experienced in his work and very careful in his command, not allowing anyone to be careless in combat maneuvers. Whenever they repelled an enemy attack, they would evaluate their shooting in the trenches, ensuring that every bullet hit the enemy.

    After the enemy's six consecutive counterattacks were repelled, the front line became silent. Gunner Zhou Deke said, "Platoon Leader, the enemy must think we are easy to beat." Wang Rushan shook his head upon hearing this and said, "We can't assume that. The enemy isn't stupid, and a little carelessness will cost us." Wang Rushan's judgment was very accurate. After the enemy fired a barrage of artillery, they began their counterattack again. Seeing two groups of enemies climbing up the mountain legs on the left and right sides of position No. 5, he immediately ordered Zhou Deke: "The enemy is attacking the main peak again, fire! Sweep the left and sweep the right, support our neighboring squad, and drive the enemy down!" Zhou Deke fired several bursts of bullets in a row, and just as he was about to drive the enemy back, his machine gun stopped firing. Wang Rushan checked and found that a bullet was jammed, so he quickly repaired the machine gun and took over the gun himself to strafe the enemy's flanks. The intense firepower finally stopped the advancing enemy.

    Wang Rushan's platoon provided timely support to the brother unit, and the brother unit repeatedly requested commendations for them, telling the company and battalion headquarters that Wang Rushan's platoon was their "good neighbor."

    Next, they repelled another counterattack by the enemy, which had increased from one platoon to more than two battalions.

    But Wang Rushan thought: the highland is the most forward position of the pseudo-Third Division. The enemy lost the position and suffered casualties, would they be willing to accept that? No, absolutely not. Just as he thought of this, the enemy's cold artillery suddenly came over, and gunner Zhou Deke was wounded. Wang Rushan didn't have time to contact the deputy platoon leader. He first carried Zhou Deke back to the shelter, and then hurried back to carry the machine gun. He thought that this machine gun had contributed a lot to them and could not be damaged by bombing under any circumstances. But when he returned to carry the gun mount, with a "whoosh" sound, the enemy fired a shell that exploded in the air, and his head was injured. He immediately fell next to the gun mount. The deputy platoon leader, leading another gunner, Jiang Pinggao, ran over and saw that Wang Rushan's face was yellow. They quickly bandaged his wounds. At this time, Wang Rushan had a lot to say, but he couldn't say it. He looked at Zhao Mingzhong and pointed to the gun mount with his finger. Zhao Mingzhong understood what he meant. He told Jiang Pinggao to carry back the gun mount, while he carried the platoon leader back to the shelter and immediately sent someone to guard the machine gun and monitor the enemy. At this time, Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Zhimin walked over with two kettles of boiling water, held Wang Rushan's hand and said, "You fought very well, the division leaders want to commend you." The soldiers looked at the platoon leader's wound and saw that he was having difficulty breathing. "Go down, Platoon Leader," everyone worriedly advised him. Wang Rushan looked at his comrades and replied in a very weak voice, "No, I'll stay here and watch you." Everyone understood the platoon leader's thoughts. Jiang Pinggao tidied up his bandages while saying, "Platoon Leader, you taught us the skills to fight the enemy, and you protected the machine gun with your body. Go down! We will fight well." Wang Rushan's breathing became more and more difficult, and after a long time, he barely said, "Keep you company a little longer." The deputy platoon leader was very excited when he heard this and stood up and said to him, "Platoon Leader, don't worry, you are a Communist Party member, and I am also a Communist Party member. You led our platoon very well, and I guarantee that I will not lead this platoon badly." As soon as Zhao Mingzhong finished speaking, Wang Rushan closed his eyes and lay quietly without moving. None of the soldiers wanted the platoon leader to leave them forever. Some crawled on the platoon leader's body to listen to whether his heart was still beating, and some touched his chest to see if it was still warm, but all hope was gone. Finally, they opened the warm water in the kettle, dipped a new towel to wipe the dust off the platoon leader's face, then covered him with a piece of tarpaulin, silently fired a shot into the air, and said their final farewell to the platoon leader.

    Then, they immediately prepared to meet the battle again. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Zhimin appointed Deputy Platoon Leader Zhao Mingzhong as acting platoon leader, and the position of deputy platoon leader was temporarily filled by gunner Jiang Pinggao. The original ammo loader Hu Baiyun also became a gunner. After accepting the new position, Zhao Mingzhong immediately led the soldiers into the firing position. With the mood of mourning his comrades, he repeated the words that the platoon leader had said before his death to the soldiers: "The day after tomorrow is October 1st, we must use victory to celebrate the National Day of the motherland and win glory for Chairman Mao." And he encouraged Jiang Pinggao and Hu Baiyun: "Young men, fight well and avenge our platoon leader."

    After more than half an hour of silence, two companies of enemy troops began to move towards position No. 3.

    As the enemy got closer and closer, Jiang Pinggao saw the enemy attacking from three sides and immediately said to the platoon leader, "Fire, Platoon Leader." "No, wait a few more seconds." Hu Baiyun also urged anxiously, "The enemy is coming up, Platoon Leader! They're like a bunch of mad dogs, fire!" Seeing that the time had come, Zhao Mingzhong gave the order: "Jiang Pinggao, fire first, aim at the crossbeam in front of the depression." Jiang Pinggao was a little flustered at first, and his shots were inaccurate. Not many enemies fell, which made him sweat profusely and constantly complain in his heart. Seeing that he couldn't suppress the enemy's evil momentum, Hu Baiyun also became anxious: "It's my turn to fire, Platoon Leader! Let me fire." "Okay, Jiang Pinggao has fired two rounds, Hu Baiyun give it a try." Jiang Pinggao was unwilling to let go, he was angry with himself and anxious, almost crying. He seemed to be swearing: "I don't deserve to be a soldier of Wang Rushan's platoon if I waste bullets again." "If you have such determination, you will definitely shoot well next time, rest for a while and then fire again." Jiang Pinggao had no choice but to obey the order and watched Hu Baiyun fire. Hu Baiyun shot accurately, and a large number of enemies fell. Seeing this, Jiang Pinggao immediately shouted, "Platoon Leader, it's my turn again." This young man had been holding back for a long time. He took the machine gun from Hu Baiyun, gritted his teeth, glared his eyes, swept left and then swept right. If the neighboring squad strafed, he would shoot straight. He only hated that he didn't shoot down enough enemies. Later, Jiang Pinggao's ears were deafened by the artillery, and Zhao Mingzhong patted him on the shoulder to direct him. When Jiang Pinggao moved a few seconds slower, a shell landed in front of the depression, and the machine gun mount was blown up again. Zhao Mingzhong picked up the bare gun body and said, "It doesn't matter if the mount is broken, our gun body is still fine." He patted Jiang Pinggao on the shoulder and said, "Quick, take out the tarpaulin." When the enemy's artillery fire extended, they folded two pieces of tarpaulin and put them under the bare gun body, and the machine gun roared steadily again. In less than ten minutes, the barrel was blown up again, Zhao Mingzhong said, "Let it blow. It's just like a person's limbs breaking a layer of skin, it's far from the heart." Jiang Pinggao was angry and furious. He took the machine gun and strafed the small group of counterattacking enemies. The young man was happy to fight, so he threw off his cotton coat and worked in his shirt. Zhao Mingzhong and Hu Baiyun cheered from the side: "Good shooting, dead bodies are falling on top of dead bodies." When Hu Baiyun wanted to replace him, Jiang Pinggao said while shooting, "No, no need to replace, I will definitely make him reach two hundred enemies." He fired more than a dozen bursts of bullets in one breath, and the machine gun did not have any problems.

    After they continuously repelled the enemy's twenty-nine counterattacks, the front line became silent for a long time. The soldiers lowered their heads and wiped the bare gun body, all of them were very silent, they were recalling the deeds of Platoon Leader Wang Rushan before his death. Once, in order to request a mission from the company headquarters, they had said to him like this: "Platoon Leader, if we can't request a mission, we don't want you as our platoon leader." At that time, Jiang Pinggao also became impatient and angry: "If the higher-ups don't give us a mission, we will all go to carry stretchers." Wang Rushan was not angry when he heard these words, he smiled and said to everyone: "Everyone think about it, why don't the higher-ups give us important missions?" These words stunned the soldiers. Wang Rushan said again: "What's the use of just being anxious? It's not that the higher-ups don't trust us, it's that our skills are not skilled enough. Didn't the battalion commander say that now is a modern war, and people all over the world are watching us. Tell me, have you mastered all kinds of weapons? Do you know how to troubleshoot? Are you familiar with the contact signals?" This time, he convinced the soldiers. From then on, the whole platoon began to practice hard. In order to improve the soldiers' shooting skills more quickly, Wang Rushan chose a mountain two hundred meters away, made a fake bunker on it, and put an oil lamp inside. Every day at dusk, the soldiers took turns practicing aiming. At first, each shooter could only shoot in bursts, only shoot through the firing hole, but could not put out the light. The soldiers stomped their feet anxiously, and Wang Rushan slowly explained: "Don't worry, as long as you work hard, success will come naturally." Encouraged by the platoon leader, after a long period of practice, each shooter was finally able to put out the light with a burst of fire.

    The soldiers were silently reminiscing when suddenly the loudspeaker on the front line sounded:
    "On this heroic mountain of 572.4,
    There is Platoon Leader Wang Rushan who sacrificed himself to protect the gun,
    He is a loyal son of the motherland,
    He led the whole platoon to win glory for the motherland..."

    英雄王如山和他的重机枪班
    宫洁民
    在志愿军某部二级战斗英雄刘根全所在的某连里，有一个重机枪班，在坚守北汉江以东五七二·四高地时，这个班在炮兵和友邻小组配合下，打死李伪军第三师二百多人。战士们把自己的机枪叫做“打不烂的宝贝枪”。
    去年九月二十九日晚上，我军全部占领这个高地后，敌人就疯狂地连续进行反扑。副排长刘志敏接到命令，上级让他们把这挺重机枪架在三号和四号阵地之间的洼部，这里是敌人进攻的重点，可以直接封锁敌人。班长王如山知道这个任务非常重要，就把全班分成两个小组：副班长赵明忠带一组，利用敌人丢下的麻袋抢修工事；王如山带一组，守住机枪。王如山虽然只二十二岁，但做事却非常老练，指挥也非常细心，不许有人在战斗动作上疏忽大意。每逢打退敌人的一次进攻，他们就在战壕里评射击，并且保证每颗子弹都能命中敌人。
    敌人连续六次反扑都被打退以后，前沿上沉寂起来了。射手周得可说：“班长，敌人准是叫咱们揍草鸡了。”王如山听了摇摇头说：“可不能这么估计，敌人不是傻子，麻痹一点也会吃亏的。”王如山判断得非常正确。敌人打了一阵炮后，又开始反扑了。他看到两股敌人正顺着五号阵地左右两侧的山腿往上爬，立刻命令周得可：“敌人又攻主峰了，打！扫了左面扫右面，支援咱们的友邻组，把敌人打下去！”周得可一连打了几梭子子弹，眼看快把敌人打退时，他的机枪却打不响了。王如山一检查，子弹卡了壳，于是他就迅速地把机枪修好，并且自己接过机枪对敌侧扫射起来。猛烈的火力终于把前进的敌人阻住了。
    王如山班及时地支援了兄弟部队，兄弟部队纷纷给他们请功，并告诉连、营指挥所，都说王如山班是他们的“好邻居”。
    接着，他们又打退了敌人由一个班增到两个多营兵力的反扑。
    但是王如山想：高地是伪三师最靠前的阵地，敌人丢了阵地又折兵，他会甘心吗？不，绝对不会的。他刚想到这里，敌人的冷炮突然打过来，射手周得可负伤了。王如山来不及和副班长联系，先把周得可抱回隐蔽部，又忙着去抱回机枪。他想这挺机枪替我们出力可不小，无论如何不能让它被炸坏。可是等他返回去抱枪架时，“啸”的一声敌人打过来一颗炮弹在空中爆炸开来，他的头部被炸伤了，他立时倒在枪架旁边；副班长带着另一个射手江平高跑来一看，王如山的脸色黄了，他们连忙给他扎伤口。这时，王如山有好多话，但是却说不出来，他望望赵明忠，同时用手指指枪架。赵明忠明白他的意思，他一边叫江平高扛回枪架，一边自己把班长抱回隐蔽部，并马上派人守住机枪，监视敌人。这时，副排长刘志敏带着两壶开水走过来，握着王如山的手说：“你们打的很好，师首长要嘉奖你们呢。”战士们望着班长的伤口，看到他呼吸非常困难。“下去吧，班长。”大家担心地劝他。王如山望着战友们，用非常微弱的声音回答：“不，我在这里看着你们。”战士们谁都了解班长的心思。江平高一边给他收拾绷带，一边说：“班长，你教会了我们打敌人的技术，你又用身子保护了机枪，下去吧！我们会打好的。”王如山的呼吸越来越困难，半天才勉强说出这样一句话：“再跟你们作一会儿伴。”副班长听了非常激动，站起来对他说：“班长，不用担心，你是个共产党员，我也是个共产党员，你把咱这个班带的很好，我保证不把这个班带坏。”赵明忠的话刚说完，王如山就闭上了眼睛，安静地躺着不动了。战士们谁也不愿班长永远离开他们，他们有的爬在班长身上听听他的心脏是否还在跳动，有的摸摸他的前胸是否还热，可是，一切希望都没有了，最后，他们才打开水壶的温水，用新毛巾蘸着给班长擦净脸上的灰尘，然后盖上一块雨布，默默地对空打了一枪，向班长作最后的告别。
    接着，他们马上又准备迎接战斗。副排长刘志敏指定副班长赵明忠为代理班长，副班长的职务暂时由射手江平高代理。原来的压弹手胡百云也成为射手了。赵明忠接受了新的职务后，马上带着战士们进入射击位置，他带着悼念战友的心情，向战士们重复着班长生前讲过的话：“后天就是十月一日，我们一定要用胜利给祖国国庆节献礼，给毛主席争光。”并且鼓励江平高和胡百云说：“小伙子们，好好地打，给咱们的班长报仇。”
    经过半点多钟的沉寂，敌人两个连的兵力又开始向三号阵地运动。
    敌人越来越近，江平高一见敌人从三面扑上来，马上对班长说：“打吧，班长。”“不，再等他几秒钟。”胡百云也着急地催促着：“敌人上来了，班长！活像一群疯狗，打吧。”赵明忠一见时机到了，这才下命令：“江平高先打，对准洼部前边那个十字梁。”江平高开始有些着慌，打的不准，敌人倒下去的不多，急的他满头大汗，心里不断抱怨自己。胡百云一见打不下敌人的邪劲，心里也着急了：“该我打了，班长！让我打吧。”“好，江平高打了两下了，胡百云试一试。”江平高那肯放手呢，又生自己的气，又着急，几乎要哭了出来，他好像在宣誓：“我再浪费子弹，就不配是王如山班的战士。”“有这样决心，下回保险会打好的，休息一会再打吧。”江平高只好听从命令，在一边看着胡百云打。胡百云打的准，敌人倒下了一大片。江平高一看着了急，马上嚷起来：“班长，又该我的了。”这个小伙子早憋足了劲，接过胡百云的机枪，咬着牙，瞪着眼，左扫了又右扫，友邻小组侧射，他就直射，他只嫌打倒的敌人少。后来，江平高的耳朵被炮震聋了，赵明忠就拍着他的肩膀指挥他。江平高动作慢了几秒钟，一颗炮弹落在洼部的前边，机枪架子又炸坏了。赵明忠抱起光板的枪身说：“架子坏了没关系，咱这枪身还好着呢。”他拍拍江平高的肩膀说：“快把雨布拿出来。”等敌人炮火一延伸，他们叠起两块雨布，垫在光板的枪身上，机枪又稳稳当当地叫了起来。不到十分钟，枪管又被炸坏了，赵明忠说：“叫他炸吧。这就好比人的手脚碰破一层皮，离心还远着呢。”江平高又气又火，接过机枪，扫射着小股反扑的敌人，小伙子打的高兴了，就把棉衣一抛，穿着衬衣干了起来。赵明忠和胡百云在一旁叫好：“打的好哇，敌人死尸上边又落上死尸了。”胡百云要换他，江平高边打边说：“不，不用换，我非叫他凑上二百个敌人不行。”他一气打了十几排子子弹，机枪没发生一点故障。
    他们连续打退敌人的二十九次反扑以后，前沿阵地上又长时间地沉寂起来。战士们低着头擦着光板的枪身，一个个的都非常沉默，他们在回忆王如山班长的生前事迹。有一次为着向连部请求任务，他们曾这样和他说过：“班长，再要求不下任务来，俺们就不要你这个班长了。”当时江平高还急躁地发脾气：“上级再不给任务，咱们就全去抬担架。”王如山听了这些话并不生气，他笑眯眯地对大家说：“大伙全琢磨琢磨，上级为什么不给咱们重要的任务呢？”这句话可把战士们问愣了。王如山又说：“光着急顶什么用呢？上级不是对我们不放心，是我们的技术还不够熟练。营长不是讲了吗，现在是近代化战争，全世界人民都看着我们呢。你们说说，各种武器全都掌握了吗？排除故障会了吗？联络信号熟悉了吗？”他这次可把战士们说得心服口服了。从此以后，全班开始了苦练。为了使战士们的射击技术快些提高，王如山选择了二百公尺距离的一个山头，上面作好假碉堡，里面放上一盏油灯，每天一到黄昏，战士们就轮番地练习瞄准。开始时，每个射手打点放，只能从射孔打进去，但总不能把灯火打灭。战士们急的直跺脚，王如山就慢慢地解释：“别心急，只要加油练，功到自然成。”在班长的鼓舞之下，战士们经过长时间的演习，每个射手终于能用点放把灯火打灭了。
    战士们正在默默地回忆着，突然前沿阵地上的扩音器响了起来：
    “在五七二·四这个英雄的山岗上，
    有个舍身护枪的王如山班长，
    他是祖国的忠实的儿子，
    他带领全班给祖国争了光……”
