Xinhua News Agency Report: During the Spring Festival, people across the country enthusiastically carried out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers.

　　Many provinces and cities held grand army-government-people get-togethers on the eve of the Spring Festival. On the 13th evening, residents of the eight districts in Shenyang and farmers in the suburban areas of the city held separate get-togethers with the local garrison troops. On the 14th evening, the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government jointly held a grand get-together. At the meeting, representatives of the army, government, and people presented flags to each other as a sign of respect. Wuhan City also held an army-government-people get-together with 1,800 participants on the 12th. In cities like Beijing, Xi'an, and Guangzhou, army-people get-together activities extended into street communities.

　　Around the Spring Festival, comfort groups and comfort teams composed of people from all regions extensively visited local PLA garrisons, convalescing members of the PLA or the Chinese People's Volunteers, and revolutionary honorary soldiers to express their regards. The CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, the Central-South Administrative Committee, and the Central-South Military Region of the People's Liberation Army jointly formed the Central-South Comfort Group, which visited wounded and sick soldiers in Wuchang, Tingsiqiao, and other places before the Spring Festival, and will be divided into groups to visit provinces such as Jiangxi and Hunan. Five comfort subgroups formed by various organs and organizations in East China and Shanghai visited the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army recuperating in Shanghai. In addition, provinces such as Shanxi, Qinghai, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, and cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Xi'an, organized comfort teams to visit local garrisons and wounded and sick soldiers.

　　During the Spring Festival, various regions also conducted comfort activities for the families of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the families of revolutionary martyrs. On the streets of Beijing, comfort teams composed of people from all walks of life have been continuously parading, carrying boxes filled with gifts and beating gongs and drums, to visit the homes of martyrs' families and soldiers' families to express their regards. Suiyuan Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region formed two comfort teams, which visited the family of Liu Guangzi, a second-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Naizidi Village, Micang County, and the families of martyrs and soldiers in Xilin Gol League and Chahar League, respectively. When comforting the families of soldiers, the counties and districts of Rehe Province and Jilin City also specifically convened celebration and congratulatory meetings for the families of heroes and meritorious personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Xinjiang Province Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families Committee held a support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families evening party on the 15th, and presented flowers to seventeen families of Chinese People's Volunteers to express their respect.

　　Local people's governments allocated large sums of comfort money and grain to a small number of martyrs' and soldiers' families with relatively difficult living conditions as a subsidy to celebrate the Spring Festival. The comfort money allocated by the people's governments of Jiangsu Province and the three cities of Shanghai, Nanchang, and Taiyuan totaled 4.69 billion yuan, of which the comfort money distributed in Shanghai during the Spring Festival was twice as much as last year. The Changsha Municipal People's Government distributed 150,000 catties of grain and gave each martyr's family and soldier's family in the city two catties of pork. People and cadres of the organs in various places also automatically donated a large number of gifts and funds to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers. The people of Shanghai, Baoding, and Taiyuan contributed a total of 1.27 billion yuan in comfort money.

　　During the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families activities, the masses in the Northeast Region, Shanxi Province, and Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changsha, Dihua, Nanjing, Hefei, Fuzhou, and other cities launched a movement for everyone to do something for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Shenyang City adopted the method of "zoning and division of labor with responsibility" to implement the call to do a good deed for the families of soldiers; primary school students throughout the city used their winter vacation to organize preferential treatment teams to "contract" odd jobs for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Citizens of all ethnic groups in Dihua City helped the families of martyrs and soldiers to clean the snow on the roofs and in the courtyards. The sixteen children of the Chen Yongwen group of the Guangzhou First Workers' and Peasants' Children's School collectively went to help the mother of Wu Wanfa, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, repair her house and wash her furniture on the second day of their winter vacation. The women of Wu Lao Village in Nanjing invited more than 100 soldiers' families nearby to take a bath in the women's bathhouse they established in the patriotic health campaign. Many residents of Taiyuan City also sent a lot of vegetables to the families of soldiers; women in cities such as Shanghai, Changsha, Hefei, and Shenyang actively participated in cleaning houses and washing clothes for the families of martyrs and soldiers.

　　While sending comfort letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers, people from all over the country also sent many beloved gifts. While writing comfort letters, workers, peasants, young people, and citizens in Dihua City rushed to make many comfort bags and sent them to the front lines in Korea. The comfort bags were filled with dried grapes, dried apricots, and other specialties of Xinjiang Province. Some comfort bags also contained velvet trousers, cigarettes, notebooks, and pens. Among the comfort items sent by the workers of the Guangzhou No. 1 Cigarette Factory to the Chinese People's Volunteers were 120 copies of the recently re-published "How Steel Was Made" and many musical instruments and daily necessities. The entire class of Class C of the third grade of Guangya Middle School in Guangzhou City, who were called "flowers of the motherland" by the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote 24 letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers during the Spring Festival, and sent many commemorative albums and life photos along with the letters.

    各地人民组成的慰问团、慰问队，在春节前后，向当地解放军驻军、解放军或志愿军的休养员和革命荣誉军人广泛进行慰问。中共中央中南局、中南行政委员会和人民解放军中南军区联合组成的中南慰问团在春节前即到武昌、汀泗桥等地慰问部队伤病员，并将分组前往江西、湖南等省进行慰问。华东和上海市各机关、团体组成的五个慰问分团分别慰问了在上海休养的志愿军和解放军的伤病员。此外，山西、青海、湖南、安徽、江苏、浙江等省和沈阳、天津、武汉、西安等市都组织了慰问队慰问当地驻军和伤病员。
    各地在春节期间，对解放军、志愿军的家属和革命烈士家属也进行了慰问活动。北京市的街道上，连日来不断走过由各界人民组成的慰问队，抬着装满礼品的抬盒，敲锣打鼓，到烈属、军属家中去慰问。绥远省和内蒙古自治区组成了两个慰问队，分别向米仓县奈子地村志愿军二级战斗英雄刘光子的家属和锡林郭勒、察哈尔两盟的烈属、军属进行慰问。热河省各县、区和吉林市在慰问军属时，还专门为志愿军英雄、功臣的家属召开了庆功贺喜大会。新疆省拥军优属委员会在十五日晚举行拥军优属晚会，曾向十七位志愿军家属献花致敬。
    各地人民政府拨出大批慰问金和粮食发给少数生活较困难的烈属、军属作为欢度春节的补助费用。江苏省和上海、南昌、太原三市人民政府所拨发的慰问金共达四十六亿九千多万元，其中上海市春节发放的慰问金就比去年增加了两倍；长沙市人民政府发放了十五万斤粮食，并送给全市每户烈属、军属两斤猪肉。各地人民群众和机关干部也自动捐献出大批慰问烈属、军属的礼品和款项。上海、保定和太原人民共献出了十二亿七千多万元的慰问金。

    各地人民群众在寄慰问信给志愿军的同时，还寄去了不少心爱的礼物。迪化市的工人、农民、青年和市民在写慰问信的同时，赶制了许多慰问袋一并寄往朝鲜前线。慰问袋里装有新疆省的特产葡萄干、杏干等，有些慰问袋还装着绒裤、纸烟、笔记本和钢笔等；广州市一中烟厂的工人们送给志愿军的慰问品中，有最近再版的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等书籍一百二十本和许多乐器、日用品。被志愿军称为“祖国的花朵”的广州市广雅中学初三丙班的全体同学，春节期间又给志愿军写了二十四封信，随信寄去许多纪念册和生活照片。
