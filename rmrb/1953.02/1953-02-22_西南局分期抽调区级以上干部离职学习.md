    The Southwest Bureau of the CCP has formulated a plan to stagger and transfer district-level and above cadres for off-the-job concentrated study to earnestly and effectively improve their cultural level. Among the 80,000 cadres in the Southwest whose cultural level is at or below primary school, 6,000 are at the district level or above. These cadres are mostly worker-peasant cadres who have gone through a relatively long period of struggle. With the development of the situation, especially facing large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, these cadres generally feel that they are unable to cope and urgently request to study culture. Therefore, systematically improving the cultural level of these cadres has become an important political task.
    The Southwest Bureau of the CCP stipulated in its instruction issued in early February that the first phase would involve transferring 2,050 worker-peasant cadres at or above the district level for off-the-job study. The cultural class established by the Party School of the Southwest Bureau will, in addition to the existing 130 students, admit 120 cadres at the level of county Party secretary and county head. The Southwest People's Revolutionary University will absorb 200 older district-level and above cadres from first-level Southwest organs. Party schools in various provinces and cities will collectively absorb 1,600 cadres at the level of county-level department heads, section chiefs, district party secretaries, and district heads (550 in Sichuan, 200 in Chongqing, 350 each in Guizhou and Yunnan, and 150 in Xikang).
    The first phase is scheduled to officially begin classes in April. The study period is set at two years. The requirement is to raise cadres who already have a higher primary school level to the level of junior high school graduates, and the rest to the level of higher primary school graduates or above. The content of study: Chinese language, mathematics, and common sense of natural science account for three-quarters of the study time, and current affairs policies and economic construction knowledge account for one-quarter of the study time. Illiterate and semi-illiterate cadres at or above the district level who are unable to enroll in the first phase are prepared to be organized as much as possible to study in spare-time cultural schools, in coordination with the literacy campaign, to gradually improve their level and lay the foundation for the second phase of concentrated study.
    The Southwest Bureau instructed the provincial and municipal Party committees to conduct discussions, submit plans for review by the Southwest Bureau, and assign dedicated personnel to step up various preparatory tasks.
    The editorial in this newspaper on February 18th suggested that the central bureaus investigate the number of district-level and above cadres with a cultural level below junior high school graduation in their respective regions, put forward plans for staggered training, and raise them to the cultural level of junior high school graduates. Currently, the Northwest Bureau and the Southwest Bureau have already formulated this plan, and the East China Bureau is in the process of drafting it. The Northeast Bureau, the North China Bureau, and the Central South Bureau have yet to draft it.

    西南局分期抽调区级以上干部离职学习
    中共中央西南局已订出计划，分期抽调区级以上干部离职集中学习，认真有效地提高他们的文化水平。西南现有的文化程度在高小以下的八万干部中，区级以上干部占六千人。他们大都是经过较长期斗争的工农干部，随着形势的发展，特别是面临着大规模的经济建设和文化建设，这些干部普遍地感到力不能胜任，迫切要求学习文化。因此，有计划地提高这些干部的文化水平，已成为重要的政治任务。
    中共中央西南局在二月上旬发出的指示中规定，第一期抽调离职学习的区级以上工农干部二千零五十人。西南局党校所设文化班除原已有学员一百三十名外，再收县委书记和县长级的干部一百二十名。西南人民革命大学吸收西南一级机关较老的区级以上干部二百名。各省、市党校共吸收县级部长、科长、区委书记、区长级干部一千六百名（四川五百五十名，重庆市二百名，贵州云南各三百五十名，西康一百五十名）。
    第一期规定在四月正式开课。学习时间定为两年。要求把已具有高小程度的干部提高到初中毕业程度，其余提高到高小毕业以上程度。学习内容：语文、数学和自然科学常识等占学习时间的四分之三，时事政策和经济建设知识占学习时间的四分之一。凡未能在第一期抽调入学的区级以上干部中的文盲、半文盲，预备尽可能组织进入业余文化学校学习，配合扫除文盲运动，逐步提高，为第二期集中学习打下基础。
    西南局指示各省、市委应进行讨论，提出计划送西南局审核，并须指派专人加紧各项准备工作。
    本报二月十八日社论中曾建议各中央局调查全区在初中毕业程度以下的区级以上干部的人数，提出分期调训的计划，把他们提高到初中毕业的文化程度。现在除西北局、西南局已把这一计划订出，华东局正在拟订中。尚未拟订的还有东北局、华北局和中南局。
