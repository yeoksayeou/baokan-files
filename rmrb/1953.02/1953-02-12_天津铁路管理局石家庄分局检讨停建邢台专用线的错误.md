Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    The Tianjin Railway Administration, Shijiazhuang Branch, issued the following letter: The "Readers' Letters" page in the People's Daily on September 24, 1952, criticized our bureau for suspending the construction of the Xingtai Coal Construction Company's dedicated line and ignoring the newspaper's criticism, which is entirely correct. The construction of the Xingtai Coal Construction Company's dedicated line was originally approved by the Central Financial and Economic Committee to be suspended. On July 25, 1952, the Central Financial and Economic Committee issued another circular ordering the resumption of construction. Our bureau did not fully understand the political and economic significance of constructing this line, and only considered the railway's own "losses," still believing that the construction of the line could be postponed and reported it to the higher authorities for verification. After the higher authorities approved that construction should continue, five months had passed, delaying the completion and use of the line, causing losses. After receiving the instructions from the Tianjin Railway Administration to resume construction of the line in early December of last year, our bureau immediately gathered manpower and materials. The line was started on December 16 and completed on December 31. After the newspaper raised its criticism, our bureau maintained an incorrect opinion on the construction of this line for a long period of time, which shows that our bureau's attitude towards criticism was not serious enough. Our bureau guarantees to correct the above shortcomings and errors in future work.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    天津铁路管理局石家庄分局检讨停建邢台专用线的错误
    天津铁路管理局石家庄分局来信：一九五二年九月二十四日人民日报“读者来信专页”对我局停建邢台煤建公司专用线以及对报纸批评置之不理一事提出批评，这是完全正确的。邢台煤建公司专用线原经中央财经委员会批准停建。一九五二年七月二十五日中央财经委员会又通令续修。我局没有全面了解修建该线的政治意义和经济意义，只考虑到铁路本身的“损失”，仍认为该线可暂缓修建，并反映给上级核示。待上级批示仍应继续修建，但已过去了五个月时间，延迟了该线的完成和使用，造成了损失。去年十二月初我局接到天津铁路管理局续修该线指示后，即紧急筹集人工材料，该线已于十二月十六日开工，十二月三十一日完成。在报纸提出批评后，我局在一个较长时期内仍保持着对该线修建问题的不正确意见，这说明我局对待批评的态度还是不够严肃的。我局保证在今后工作中纠正上述缺点和错误。
