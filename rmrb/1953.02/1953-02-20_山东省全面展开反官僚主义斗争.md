The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has been launched throughout Shandong Province.

As early as last August, after the "Qianyang Village Incident" in Jimo County, where bad cadres suppressed democracy and beat the masses, Comrade Xiang Ming, Second Secretary of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, instructed Dazhong Daily to publicly criticize the incident, and instructed local Party committees to study the news and editorials about it. Combining the study of documents related to the incident, various localities conducted in-depth inspections and found that bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline were quite common throughout the province. The Shandong Sub-bureau reported this serious situation to the CPC Central Committee and actively arranged to carry out this struggle. The enlarged meeting of the Shandong Sub-bureau Committee held from December 18 last year to January 5 this year listed the opposition to bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline as one of the central topics. After the enlarged meeting, the Shandong Sub-bureau received instructions from the CPC Central Committee agreeing to Shandong's carrying out this struggle. The guiding ideology became clearer, and the understanding of this issue was further enhanced. The Shandong Sub-bureau immediately instructed Party committees at all levels to study the central instructions and carry out this struggle. It also instructed Dazhong Daily to continuously expose the "Zhang Zuochen Incident" of forcing the masses to pull cotton and the "Zhaowangtang Village Incident" of severely oppressing the masses, in order to promote this movement.

In studying the section on the Party in Malenkov's report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Shandong Sub-bureau's departments, provincial mass organizations, and Shandong Provincial People's Government units, according to the instructions of the Sub-bureau, simultaneously studied the central instructions and the report conveying the spirit of the Sub-bureau's enlarged meeting. They began to conduct the anti-bureaucracy struggle in conjunction with inspecting the work of their respective departments. While all cadres of the Shandong Provincial People's Government began to examine the bureaucratic phenomena in their departments, the general Party group of the Provincial People's Government first conducted a self-criticism. Then, the Party groups of each department absorbed Party member cadres above the section level to participate in the self-criticism. In order not to hinder current work, the Shandong Provincial People's Government concentrated its efforts on overcoming the main bureaucratic problems of each department. First, the branch collected the criticisms of the leadership's bureaucracy from all cadres and reflected them to the Party group. After the Party group studied and criticized itself, it made a self-criticism to all cadres and proposed improvement measures. This approach had a very good effect. In the self-criticism of the general Party group and the Party groups of each department, it was found that the long-standing bureaucratic phenomena in the Shandong Provincial People's Government organs were very serious. The Provincial People's Government was very weak in its leadership of the departments. The departments acted on their own. Many important instructions for the whole province were issued directly by the departments. Many major issues were decided by the departments themselves without being discussed by the Provincial People's Government. Cadres criticized this as "a leaderless pack, with arrows flying in all directions." For example, major issues such as comprehensive price adjustments and tax system reforms were not discussed by the Provincial Finance Committee, and the Commercial Department ignored Shandong's specific conditions and instructed its subordinate systems to begin implementation. Another example is the Education Department's unauthorized issuance of instructions to conduct "Three-Anti" campaigns in schools; without asking for instructions, it independently decided on the major issues of how many middle schools to add in the province last year, as well as school construction and enrollment. The Agriculture and Forestry Department unilaterally arranged for the construction of important shelterbelts without asking for instructions. The Industry Department purchased more than 200 machines from abroad without approval. This situation existed in almost every department. Each department assigned tasks to the lower levels according to its own vertical system, resulting in an especially large number of professional conferences and various professional instructions. In the past three years, the Shandong Provincial People's Government had only held one conference of commissioners, county heads, and mayors to unify work arrangements, but last year alone, there were more than 100 province-wide professional conferences for which the Provincial People's Government reimbursed expenses. The Agriculture and Forestry Department held as many as 24 province-wide conferences last year. The number of official documents and letters sent directly to various localities by the departments was also staggering. The Industry Department and the Agriculture and Forestry Department each sent out more than 10,000 pieces last year. According to statistics from the Yishui Prefectural Commissioner's Office, from January to October last year, they received a total of more than 47,000 pieces of various official documents, letters, telegrams, instructions, and notices forwarded from higher-level documents from provincial-level agencies, averaging more than 150 pieces per day. Such a large number of conferences and instructions often only assigned tasks to the lower levels, without explaining policies; they only set deadlines for completing numbers, without checking the specific progress of various tasks, thus greatly contributing to the bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline of lower-level agencies. For example, the Agriculture and Forestry Department's instructions to promote S-type cotton emphasized "prohibiting the planting of miscellaneous cotton" and "resolutely eradicating miscellaneous cotton," which not only led to Zhang Zuochen's cotton-pulling incident, but also had the same impact in many areas. The Transportation Department only stipulated that each transportation company complete a certain task, so some transportation companies monopolized transportation, contracted goods at high prices, and then transferred them to private transportation at low prices, profiting from the difference. The Transportation Department even praised them by saying "whoever makes the most money is a good manager." Other serious phenomena such as patriarchal rule, suppression of democracy, and repeated rejection of tasks from higher levels were also checked out one by one.

In this inspection, the general Party group of the Provincial People's Government and the Party groups of each department carried out criticism and self-criticism relatively fully, and the movement in each unit was carried out relatively normally. Except for the Education Department (because the director of the department, Wang Zhe, lacked the spirit of self-criticism, although the masses' emotions were very high, the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the department progressed slowly and still remained at the stage of criticizing his undemocratic style, and had not yet further examined the bureaucratic phenomena in the department's business leadership) and a few other units, the movement in each unit was carried out better. Before the Spring Festival, most agencies ended the initial inspection phase, and after the Spring Festival, they moved into the stage of studying improvements.

Under the leadership of the Shandong Sub-bureau, this anti-bureaucracy struggle in the Shandong Provincial People's Government emphasized combining it with the current central work, and paid attention to inspecting and improving at the same time. For example, the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Government resumed daily briefings; the Provincial People's Government's administrative meetings, which had not been held for several months, were also held on time every Friday in order to handle daily major events in a unified and timely manner. The Shandong Provincial People's Government is now formulating key points for its work in 1953 in order to uniformly deploy the work for the whole year and make the work of each department consistent; the Secretary-General is also organizing a special group to draft key points on how to improve leadership work, and provide them for discussion in the next stage. In order to strengthen the understanding of the situation at the lower levels and help carry out the anti-bureaucracy struggle, provincial-level agencies in Shandong have selected more than 100 cadres, who, after more than ten days of policy study, have formed eleven groups to go to various prefectures for key inspections. The Shandong Provincial People's Government has also decided to select another one-third of the responsible cadres to go deep into the rural factories first to specifically understand and help the work at the lower levels.

After the enlarged meeting of the Shandong Sub-bureau, each prefecture and municipality directly under the province began to study the central government's instructions on opposing bureaucracy and the report conveying the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Shandong Sub-bureau, and universally convened enlarged meetings of the prefectural Party committees in mid-January to deploy this work. According to the instructions of the Shandong Sub-bureau, the methods and steps to be taken should generally start with study to unify thinking; then, work should be inspected with emphasis, and some typical cases should be dealt with in a big way to improve leadership, educate cadres, and mobilize the masses. Attention should also be paid to combining it with the current central work in various localities. For example, when deploying and mobilizing spring plowing and production, the bureaucratic and commandist style manifested in last year's patriotic bumper harvest competition and mutual aid and cooperation movement should be criticized; in the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, the bureaucratic, commandist, and illegal and undisciplined phenomena in handling marriage issues should be corrected. In this way, the struggle in various localities can have vivid and specific content, and can promote the progress of current work. This time, the eleven working groups organized by the Shandong provincial-level organs, carrying materials on more than 100 major cases, went to various localities with a specific purpose to further investigate and mobilize the masses to deal with them, which will further promote the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in various localities.

On February 7, after Chairman Mao called on the entire country and all levels of agencies to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC, the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in order to deepen this struggle, convened a joint meeting on the 11th, presided over by Deputy Secretary Lai Keke, with the participation of responsible comrades from the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission, the People's Government's political and legal departments, and the Party's various propaganda organs, to focus on discussing ways to organize propaganda forces and further promote this struggle.

### 山东省全面展开反官僚主义斗争

    山东省全面展开反官僚主义斗争
    【本报讯】反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，已在山东全省范围内展开。
    早在去年八月，即墨县坏干部压制民主、殴打群众的“前阳村事件”被揭发以后，中共中央山东分局第二书记向明同志即指示大众日报公开批评这一事件，并指示各地党委学习关于这一事件的新闻和社论。各地结合着对有关这一事件的文件的学习，进行了深入的检查，发现官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象在全省各地相当普遍。山东分局将这种严重情况报告中共中央，并积极布置开展这一斗争。去年十二月十八日至今年一月五日所召开的山东分局委员会扩大会议，把反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪现象列为中心议题之一。山东分局在扩大会议后得到中共中央同意山东开展这一斗争的批示，领导思想更加明确，对这一问题的认识也提高了一步。山东分局立即指示各级党委学习中央指示，开展这一斗争，并指示大众日报连续揭发强迫群众拔棉的“张作臣事件”和严重欺压群众的“赵王堂村事件”等，以推动这一运动。
    山东分局各部委、省级群众团体及山东省人民政府各单位在学习马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中关于党的部分时，根据分局指示，同时学习了中央指示和分局扩大会议的传达报告，结合检查本部门工作，开始进行反官僚主义斗争。在山东省人民政府全体干部开始检查本部门的官僚主义现象的同时，省人民政府总党组首先进行检讨；接着各厅的分党组吸收处级以上的党员干部参加，进行检讨。为了不妨害当前工作，山东省人民政府集中力量克服各厅局的主要的官僚主义毛病。首先由支部把全体干部对领导方面的官僚主义的批评意见汇集反映到分党组，经分党组研究检讨后，再向全体干部作检讨，并提出改进办法。这样进行的效果很好。在总党组和各分党组的检讨中，检查出省人民政府机关长期存在的官僚主义现象很严重。省人民政府对各厅领导很弱，各厅各自为政，很多全省性的重要指示都由各厅直接发出，很多重大问题不经省人民政府讨论就由各厅自己决定，干部批评这是“群龙无首，万箭齐发”。例如关于全面性的物价调整和税制改革等重大问题，省财委都没有讨论，商业厅就不顾山东具体情况，指示所属系统开始进行。又如教育厅擅自发布在学校中进行“三反”的指示；没有请示，便自行决定全省去年增加多少中学，以及校舍修建和招生等重大问题。农林厅没请示就擅自布置建设关系重大的防护林带。工业厅没得到批准就向国外购买了二百多部机器。这种情况几乎每个部门都有。各部门都按自己垂直系统向下布置任务，因而专业会议和各种专业指示就特别繁多。三年来，山东省人民政府只召开过一次专员和县长、市长会议统一布置工作，但去年全年全省性的专业会议仅在省人民政府报销经费的就有一百多次。农林厅在去年一年中召开全省性的会议即达二十四次。各厅直接发到各地的公文函件也多得惊人。工业厅和农林厅去年都发出一万件以上。据沂水专署各部门总计：去年一月至十月共接到省级各机关各种公文、函电、指示、通知及转发上级文件等共达四万七千余件，平均一天一百五十多件。这样多的会议和指示，往往只向下面布置任务，不交代政策；只限期完成数字，不检查各项工作的具体进行状况，因而大大助长了下级机关的官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的行为。如农林厅推行斯字棉的指示，强调“禁止种杂棉”、要“坚决铲除杂棉”，就不仅促成了张作臣的拔棉事件，在许多地区也发生了同样的影响。交通厅只规定各运输公司完成一定任务，因此，有的运输公司就垄断运输，用高价包揽货物，然后用低价转给民间运输，从中牟利，交通厅甚至以“谁搞的钱多谁是好经理”来加以表扬。其他类如家长式统治、压制民主、屡次拒绝上级任务等严重现象，也一一被检查出来。
    省人民政府总党组和各分党组这次检查中，比较充分地开展了批评与自我批评，各单位的运动也进行得比较正常。除教育厅（因该厅厅长王哲缺乏自我批评精神，虽然群众情绪很高，但该厅反官僚主义斗争，进展较慢，至今仍停留在对他的不民主作风的批判阶段，还未进一步检查该厅在业务领导方面的官僚主义现象）等少数单位外，各单位都开展得较好。春节前大部分机关都结束初步的检查阶段，春节后即转入研究改进的阶段。
    山东省人民政府各单位这次反官僚主义斗争，在山东分局领导下，强调结合当前中心工作，并注意一面检查一面改进。如省人民政府主席与秘书长恢复每日碰头会；过去几个月不开的省人民政府政务会议也在每星期五准时召开，以便统一、及时地处理日常重大事件。山东省人民政府现正制订一九五三年工作要点，以统一部署全年工作，使各厅局工作步调一致；并由秘书长组织专门小组草拟如何改进领导工作的要点，提供下一阶段讨论。为加强对下层情况的了解，并帮助开展反官僚主义的斗争，山东省省级各机关已抽调出一百多干部，经过十多天的政策学习，组成十一个小组，分赴各专区作重点检查。山东省人民政府并决定再抽出三分之一的负责干部首先深入农村工厂，具体了解和帮助下层工作。
    各专区和各省辖市在山东分局扩大会议以后，就开始学习中央关于反官僚主义的指示和山东分局扩大会议的传达报告，并在一月中旬普遍召集了地委扩大会议，布置这一工作。进行的方法和步骤，根据山东分局指示，一般应先从学习入手，以统一思想；然后有重点地检查工作，大张旗鼓地处理一些典型案件，以提高领导、教育干部、发动群众。并应注意结合各地当前中心工作，如布置动员春耕生产时，则着重批判去年爱国丰产竞赛和互助合作运动中所表现的官僚主义、命令主义作风；在宣传贯彻婚姻法运动中，着重纠正处理婚姻问题上的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。这样就可以使得各地开展这一斗争具有生动的具体内容，又能推动当前各项工作的进行。这次山东省级机关所组织的十一个工作组，携带一百多件重大案件的材料，有目的地到各地进一步调查，发动群众进行处理，对各地的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争将进一步起推动作用。
    二月七日，毛主席在政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上号召在全国范围内和各级机关中开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争以后，中共中央山东分局为使这一斗争深入开展，于十一日由副书记赖可可同志召集党的纪律检查委员会、人民政府的政治法律部门以及党的各种宣传机关的负责同志参加的联席会议，集中讨论了组织宣传力量，进一步推动这一斗争的办法。
