Xinhua News Agency, February 30th, dispatch from Karachi via TASS: The heavy cruiser "Pittsburgh"—flagship of Vice Admiral Wright, commander of the U.S. Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Forces—has arrived in Karachi. Wright himself also flew to Karachi.

At a press conference, Wright said that his visit to Pakistan was completely unrelated to the issue of organizing the so-called "Middle East Command." However, according to newspaper reports, in addition to holding formal talks with the Prime Minister and Governor-General of Pakistan, Wright also intends to visit Peshawar, the Khyber Pass, and Rawalpindi, where he will meet with General Muhammad Khan Ayub, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army.

In a dispatch from Karachi published in the "Combat Journal," an "Indian Times" reporter wrote that the U.S. Navy Vice Admiral's visit was not without purpose. His visit was either directly related to pushing Pakistan to join the "Middle East Group" or directly related to increasing U.S. military aid to Pakistan. In this regard, the reporter pointed out that visits by U.S. military representatives to Pakistan have been increasingly frequent recently. For example, at the end of 1952, Admiral Radford, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Mrs. Rosenberg, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense (responsible for personnel matters), both visited Pakistan. They were particularly interested in the military installations in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province and the Khyber Pass.

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: People from all walks of life in Pakistan oppose the conspiracy of U.S. and British imperialists to drag Pakistan into the Middle East aggression group.

According to Agence France-Presse, on January 30th, Professor Shamsul Haq, Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, representing many Pakistani trade unions, mass organizations, the Azad Pakistan Party, and other parties, jointly issued an appeal with two leaders of the Jinnah People's Muslim League, urging the Pakistani government not to participate in the proposed "Middle East Defense Organization" and not to provide bases for the army, navy, and air force to foreign countries. The appeal pointed out that the so-called "Middle East Defense Organization" is a trap of U.S. and British imperialists.

    巴基斯坦人民反对参加中东侵略集团
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩二十八日讯：“匹兹堡号”重巡洋舰——美国东大西洋及地中海海军司令赖特海军中将的旗舰——到了喀喇蚩。赖特本人也乘飞机到了喀喇蚩。
    赖特在记者招待会上说，他这次访问巴基斯坦，和组织所谓“中东司令部”的问题完全没有关系。但是据报纸报道，赖特除了要和巴基斯坦总理及总督举行正式会谈外，还打算到白沙瓦、开伯尔隘口和拉瓦尔品第去，他将在拉瓦尔品第会见巴基斯坦陆军总司令穆罕默德汗·阿尤布将军。
    “印度时报”记者在从喀喇蚩发出的、刊载在“战斗报”上的消息中写道，这个美国海军中将的访问不是毫无目的的，他的访问不是直接和促使巴基斯坦加入“中东集团”有关，就是直接和增加美国对巴基斯坦的军事援助有关。在这方面，这位记者指出，近来美国军事代表访问巴基斯坦的事情是越来越多了。例如在一九五二年年底，美国太平洋舰队司令雷德福海军上将和美国助理国防部长（负责兵员和人事工作的）罗森堡夫人都曾访问巴基斯坦。他们对巴基斯坦西北边省和开伯尔隘口的军事设备都特别感兴趣。
    【新华社二日讯】巴基斯坦各阶层人民反对美英帝国主义者想把巴基斯坦拉进中东侵略集团的阴谋。
    据法新社报道，一月三十日，全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长山萨姆尔·哈伊教授代表巴基斯坦许多工会、群众团体、自由巴基斯坦党及其它党派，并偕同真纳人民回教联盟的两个领袖联合发表呼吁书，要求巴基斯坦政府不要参加建议中的“中东防御组织”，也不要把陆、海、空军的基地供给外国使用。呼吁书指出，所谓“中东防御组织”是美英帝国主义者的圈套。
