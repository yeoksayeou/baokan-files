    The International Bookstore Should Improve the Distribution of Russian Professional Books
    Letter from Ge Changchun: The International Bookstore now distributes many Russian professional books to the libraries of various organizations, but this work is not satisfactory enough. For example, the books that everyone in our Iron and Steel Testing Institute of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry needs often only has one copy, while we have quite a few books that we don't need but other units urgently need (such as books on high-speed cutting methods, etc.). Russian books are now in short supply, and how to rationally distribute the existing Russian professional books to the places that need them most is a very important issue. It is suggested that the International Bookstore attach importance to this issue and improve the distribution of Russian professional books.

    国际书店应该改进分配俄文专业书籍的工作
    葛昌杶来信：国际书店现在把很多俄文专业书籍分配给各机关图书馆，但这个工作做得还不够令人满意。如我们中央重工业部钢铁试验所里大家都需要的书籍往往只有一本，我们不太需要而其它单位急需的书籍（如有关高速切削法的书籍等）倒有不少。俄文书籍现在已供不应求，怎样把现有的俄文专业书籍合理地分配到最需要的地方是一个十分重要的问题。建议国际书店重视这个问题，改进分配俄文专业书籍的工作。
