Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: According to TASS: The special sub-committee of the French National Assembly continued last week to examine the government's request to strip the leaders of the French Communist Party of their parliamentary privileges.

Etienne Fajon, who was accused along with Jacques Duclos and other leaders of the French Communist Party of "attempting to undermine public morale and discourage morale," pointed out to the special subcommittee that the government's persecution of Communist Party members aimed to prevent the French people from uniting around the working class and to threaten peace fighters in order to continue selling out national interests, turning France into a vassal of American imperialism, plunging France into poverty and unemployment, and preparing to launch another world war.

Fajon said that he was accused because he delivered a speech at the Ninth Congress of the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party, published articles in "L'Humanité," defended the right to national self-determination, and supported the struggle of the masses against economic militarization and against the transportation and manufacture of war materials.

Fajon continued: The Communist Party, loyal to proletarian internationalism, has often called and will continue to call on the working people to oppose all forms of colonial oppression. We support the legitimate national demands of the people of Indochina, advocate peace in Vietnam, and will continue to lead the masses in their struggle to urge the government to adopt a peaceful policy.

Fajon exposed that the French government, which is falsely accusing the leaders of the Communist Party, is destroying France, forcing soldiers and officers to die in unjust wars in Asia, attempting to turn the French army into American infantry under the banner of the "European Army," and handing over dozens of French provinces for use by American occupation forces. Finally, Fajon emphasized that the working class and the French people under the leadership of the Communist Party must expose this fascist conspiracy that endangers the French Republic and change France's foreign policy in order to restore national independence and strengthen democracy and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: According to TASS, Paris, February 2nd: French government authorities have recently falsely accused Fernand Vigne, Secretary-General of the French National Peace Council, of the so-called crime of "participating in activities to undermine morale." Yves Farge, Chairman of the French National Peace Council, issued a statement on the matter. Farge pointed out that the French government wants to strike at the peace movement at this time "because it wants to quickly approve the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Agreement, and to prevent the French people from expressing their will in order to sacrifice France's independence." Farge emphasized: The French people protest the framing of Fernand Vigne, step up the rescue of Alain Le Leap, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, who has been illegally imprisoned, and other patriotic people, and unite to carry out a strong national unity movement against the rearmament of West Germany. In this way, the French people will shatter the conspiracy of those who give the Nazis a chance for revenge.

    法戎揭露法政府出卖国家迫害法共的阴谋
    法奇抗议法政府诬陷法国全国和平理事会总书记
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社讯：法国国民议会特别小组委员会上周继续审查政府关于剥夺法国共产党领袖的议员特权的要求。
    和雅克·杜克洛及法国共产党其他领袖一同被控“企图败坏民心，沮丧士气”的艾蒂安·法戎向特别小组委员会指出：政府迫害共产党议员，其目的在于阻挠法国人民团结在工人阶级周围，并且威胁和平战士，以便继续出卖民族利益，把法国变成美帝国主义的附庸，使法国陷于贫困和失业，并且准备发动另外一次世界大战。
    法戎说，他之所以被控，是因为他在法国共产党塞纳省委员会第九次会议上发表了演说，在“人道报”上发表了文章，维护民族自决权，并且支持人民群众反对经济军事化、反对运输和制造战争物资的斗争。
    法戎继续说：忠于无产阶级国际主义的共产党常常号召并且还要继续号召劳动人民反对任何形式的殖民压迫。我们支持印度支那人民合法的民族要求，主张在越南实现和平，并且要继续领导人民群众为促使政府采取和平政策而斗争。
    法戎揭露了诬告共产党领袖的法国政府正在毁灭法国，强迫士兵和军官在亚洲的非正义战争里送死，企图在“欧洲军”的招牌下把法国的军队变成美国的步兵，并且把法国好几十省的领土交给美国占领军使用。最后，法戎着重指出：在共产党领导下的工人阶级和法国人民一定要揭穿这种危害法兰西共和国的法西斯阴谋，并且要使法国改变外交政策，以恢复民族独立，加强民主与和平。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二日讯：法国政府当局最近又诬告法国全国和平理事会总书记费南·维涅犯了所谓“参与沮丧士气活动”罪。法国全国和平理事会主席伊夫·法奇特就此事发表声明。法奇指出：法国政府之所以要在这个时候打击和平运动，“是因为它想尽速批准波恩条约和巴黎协定，要阻止法国人民表白他们的意志，以便牺牲法国的独立”。法奇强调：法国人民抗议诬陷费南·维涅，加紧营救被非法囚禁的法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普及其他爱国志士，并且联合起来进行反对武装西德的强有力的民族团结运动，这样，法国人民就会粉碎那些给纳粹分子以复仇机会的人的阴谋。
