    Opposing Subjectivist Distortions in Natural Science
    Soviet Union, You. Zhdanov
    Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is of great significance for the development of advanced materialist science and for the struggle against various manifestations of unscientific, idealist viewpoints. This applies not only to social sciences but also to natural sciences.
    In his work, Comrade Stalin pointed out the erroneous position of some economists who denied the objective nature of scientific laws and attempted to imagine that scientific laws could be abolished or transformed according to people's will. This viewpoint directly leads to the swamp of subjective idealism. Comrade Stalin criticized those who held such views and emphasized this principle of Marxist theory: "Marxism understands the laws of science—whether they are laws of natural science or political economy—as reflections of objective processes which operate independently of the will of man. Men can discover these laws, get to know them, study them, reckon with them in their activities and utilise them in the interests of society, but they cannot change or abolish them, still less can they form or create new scientific laws." (Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Chinese translation, People's Publishing House edition, page 2.)
    In this profound definition, the most important conclusions for the development of science are presented in a clear and concise form. The definition stipulated by Comrade Stalin emphasized the regularity of natural phenomena and social life, and revealed the objective nature of scientific laws and the cognizability of these laws. This definition opposes the passive understanding of laws and opposes the idolization of laws. At the same time, Comrade Stalin gave a fatal blow to subjectivism, which is manifested in various forms in science.
    For decades, the great creators of Marxist-Leninist science have consistently upheld and developed this understanding of the nature of scientific laws, exposing all kinds of idealists. One of the manifestations of the idealist worldview is subjectivism in science, that is, the intention to deprive natural and social laws of their objective content, and the attempt to replace objective scientific methods of cognition with some kind of subjective method in science.
    The struggle of Lenin and Stalin in exposing the anti-scientific doctrines of liberal populists, Socialist-Revolutionaries, anarchists, and Empirio-critics is a classic example of the struggle against subjectivist views in science. As everyone knows, the populists, headed by Mikhailovsky, denied that objective research methods could be applied to the phenomena of social life. They separated social phenomena from the sum total of the "natural historical process" and demanded the creation of a special "subjective method in sociology." This method boiled down to studying historical phenomena from the perspective of human thoughts and goals, from the point of view of human desires, feelings, and intentions. Here, the populists evaded the question of the origin of these social thoughts and goals, exposing their complete lack of understanding of the determining role of people's social existence in their feelings, thoughts, and desires. Lenin exposed the errors of the populists' views, writing: "Just as Darwin put an end to the view of species of animals and plants as fortuitous, 'divinely created,' unchanging, and isolated, and was the first to put biology on an absolutely scientific basis by establishing the mutability and the succession of species, so Marx put an end to the view of society as a mechanical aggregation of individuals, which allows of all kinds of arbitrary modification at the will of the authorities (or, what amounts to the same thing, at the will of society and the government), and which arises and changes fortuitously, and was the first to put sociology on a scientific basis by establishing the concept of the socio-economic formation as the sum total of definite relations of production, and by establishing the fact that the development of such formations is a process of natural history."
    ( "Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 1, pp. 99-100, Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House Edition.)
    Without smashing subjectivism in sociology, it is impossible to establish a truly materialist social science, and it is impossible to have scientific foresight as the basis of our party's policies. Subjectivism inevitably leads its supporters to the bewilderment of chaotic randomness, to infatuation with illusions, and ultimately to political adventurism.
    The struggle against various manifestations of subjectivism is also of great significance in the field of natural sciences. The establishment of thorough scientific and objective research methods in all the most important fields of natural science is the result of a fierce struggle against subjectivist views, which are a form of idealism.
    Timiryazev's struggle against the vitalists—the so-called "psychological" method of plant psychologists in botany—is well known. The advocates of this subjective method even talked about the "memory" and "will" of plants, the "psychology" of plants, and attempted to explain the growth of plants by the "instinctive desire" of stems to face the sun.
    The physiology of higher nervous activity is an important member of the front of advanced materialist science against subjectivism. The modern achievements of this science should be attributed to Academician Pavlov. When Pavlov delivered his famous speech "Natural Science and the Brain," in which he insisted on objective methods in physiology, Timiryazev wrote the following words to him:
    "I have had to wage constant struggles for many years with old and young, Russian and German botanists, who preached that physiologists should reject the 'strict rules of natural scientific thinking' and replace them with some kind of nonsense about plant psychology, which fortunately does not yet exist. Now, when I can point out that such a 'great physiologist on Russian soil' as you has announced that he has taken as his task the expulsion of the psychological method from its last stronghold in physiology, I feel more solid ground under my feet and can give it a further counterattack."
    Pavlov, in his writings, repeatedly emphasized the futility of the so-called subjective method and the uselessness of general discussions about the spirit. He demanded a thorough, materialistic, strictly objective analysis of all aspects of human and animal behavior, while never ignoring the difficulty of this task. He criticized the methods of subjectivists who used assumptions about the feelings and desires of animals, or who attempted to establish physiology and psychology based on their own observations. Pavlov wrote: "The subjective method of studying phenomena has existed since the first man appeared in the world, and what has it given us? Nothing. Everything fabricated by means of the subjective method must be destroyed and rebuilt."
    Pavlov's objective method was openly attacked by scholars with idealist sentiments. Just as the populists, under the pretext of the characteristics of social phenomena, demanded the abolition of objective methods in sociology, in physiology, some people, under the pretext of the characteristics of human higher nervous activity, demanded the rejection of objective methods. The basis of the subjectivist distortion in physiology is the insurmountable concept of the "spirit," the concept of some inexplicable, unrecognizable "psychological" essence, to which the usual criteria of rigorous scientific, objective research cannot be applied.
    The most active opponents of Pavlovian physiology were Academician Orbeli, as well as Academician Beritov, Professor Anokhin, and several other physiologists, who were criticized by the scientific community at the joint conference on physiological problems convened by the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1950. Academician Orbeli falsified Pavlov's theory, interpreting the objective method as a limited, one-sided method, and called for the use of subjective methods to supplement it in order to "overcome" this limitation. He wrote, "In order to establish the basic laws of the activity of the central nervous system, physiologists must simultaneously use subjective and objective research methods." It should be pointed out that this view is still popular among physiologists today.
    Materialist physiologists regard the elimination of the remnants of subjectivism as their urgent task. Without solving this problem, it is impossible to successfully advance along the road of creatively developing Pavlovian physiology.
    The intrusion of subjectivist views into chemical science has also brought great harm. In chemistry, this kind of thinking has gained its unique expression under the name of the so-called mesomerism or resonance theory, which is in principle opposed to Butlerov's materialist theory, which holds that scholars can recognize the objectively existing relationships between atoms in molecules through observation, experience, and thinking, and can reflect this relationship in structural formulas.
    Butlerov's theory of chemical structure is based on real, objective chemical relationships when studying the structure of compounds, while proponents of resonance theory suggest using the idea of ​​how many structural formulas can be used to describe a specific compound based on a certain dogma about the chemical valence of atoms. After that, the true structure of the molecule is interpreted as a structure between several clearly not reflecting any reality, only used to describe the structural formulas (intermediate or resonating structure). One of the founders of this pseudo-scientific theory, the American chemist Wheland, admitted: "The resonance idea is an artificial concept, and its degree of artificiality is deeper than other physical theories. It does not reflect any inherent characteristics of the molecule itself, but is a mathematical method invented by physicists and chemists for their own convenience." Since Wheland has declared that resonance is a fiction without physical significance, he still solemnly studies the issue of "the influence of resonance on the physical and chemical properties of molecules."
    The interpretation of scientific results as a convenient method for describing facts, which was plagiarized from positivist philosophy, is a breeding ground for cultivating subjectivism in chemistry. For a long time, agnostic chemists have believed that science cannot understand the essence of chemical reactions and molecular structures, and that the usefulness of chemical formulas lies only in conveniently describing chemical changes. This naturally leads to arbitrariness in science, while attributing dozens or hundreds of chemical formulas to a substance, thus making the synthesis of compounds difficult. Resonance theorists, along with their subjectivist views, fell into the realm of confusion and randomness, calling on chemists to follow "the wonderful instinct" and "intuition," in other words, demanding a rejection of science.
    Soviet chemists have waged a struggle against resonance theory, but not always have the subjective roots of this theory been exposed.
    The development of modern physics is also advancing in the struggle against various manifestations of subjectivism in this knowledge department. The wave of Kantianism has made subjectivist views permeate physics, just as it has permeated other natural science departments. This Kantianism is the most important weapon of the reactionary forces of imperialism on the scientific front. Lenin, in his brilliant work "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," ruthlessly criticized the subjectivist views of Machists, Empirio-critics, and physicists who were confused by them.
    The tendency to deviate from objective research methods is strongly manifested in the modern physics of the capitalist world. For example, the famous physicist Bohr stated that in atomic physics "there can be no strict distinction between object and subject." The British astronomer Eddington wrote that the laws and constants of physics are entirely subjective and can be introduced a priori.
    Another physicist, Jordan, even expressed the opinion that researchers in physical experiments are not studying objective reality, but are "preparing the reality of physics." This view is also somewhat popular in Soviet scientific literature, especially in the works of physicist Markov, who wrote that it seems that the physical reality of quantum theory contains factors of human active activity, which is subordinate to human activity. Markov believes that including human activity in the concept of physical reality shows the power and role of scientific knowledge. But in fact, this view causes damage to the objective content of physical science, deprives it of correct guidance for practice, and also reduces the power of human knowledge.
    The so-called results of relativity in physics have also been subjected to incorrect, subjectivist interpretations. Relativists interpret the categories of space, time, and causality as several forms of intuition, as things that cannot be separated from consciousness. Einstein, in one of his books on relativity, said: "Everyone has his own subjective time." These discussions, as well as many discussions of this kind, prove that there is a mess in the minds of those physicists who have been led astray by Machist philosophy from the standpoint of rigorous scientific, objective research methods. The achievements of modern physics refute the views of subjectivists, Machists, and agnostics, and prove the objective nature of science, the cognizability of natural processes, and the ability of science to penetrate the deepest secrets of the universe.
    The struggle of advanced materialist science against subjectivist theories and other idealist theories is, in the final analysis, one of the manifestations of the historical struggle between two irreconcilable class forces—the working class and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism. The reactionary forces of imperialism, headed by the American bourgeoisie, try to maintain their class interests and do not hesitate to use any reactionary, idealistic, and anti-scientific ideas to fight against materialism. In the science department, the reactionary forces clamor for the latest positivism and Machism, declare a crusade against objective truth, against the material understanding of the world, and against the cognizability of natural and social phenomena.
    It cannot be ignored that this view has also invaded Soviet science. Here, individual scholars, relying on terminological tricks, attempt to forge in the guise of Marxism, just as Bogdanov, a clear opponent of Marxism in those years, attempted to impersonate his Machist views as Marxism. Modern subjectivism, under our current conditions, is characterized by trying to "slightly modify" and "supplement" objective scientific methods under the pretext of the characteristics and nature of this or that phenomenon being studied.
    In all departments of knowledge, subjectivism is the enemy of true science. Subjectivism and science cannot coexist. In fact, there is no scientific development that can be based on the "subjective method" as a true foundation; science only knows one unique effective and strictly objective research method, which has proven to be effective everywhere: whether it is in sociology and physics, in physiology and chemistry, in psychology and geology. Of course, this does not deny that each department of knowledge has its own special research methods and its own special regularity. Comrade Stalin, in his works "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," pointed out the extremely important significance of the special regularity of social phenomena, emphasizing that neglecting this specialization would be a great mistake. At the same time, the specialization of all phenomena itself requires objective analysis from the standpoint of materialist science.
    The use of objective scientific methods can reveal the regularity of nature and society. No science can develop without acknowledging and studying these regularities. Based on the knowledge already obtained, human practice has developed, using natural forces for the benefit of society and limiting spontaneous destructive effects. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "Therefore, when people speak of 'conquering' the forces of nature or economic forces, of 'mastering' them, and so forth, they by no means imply that people can 'abolish' scientific laws or 'enact' them. On the contrary, they only mean that people can discover laws, get to know them, master them, learn to apply them with complete knowledge and utilize them in the interests of society, thus conquering them and obtaining control over them." (Chinese translation, People's Publishing House edition, page 7)
    Knowledge of the objective laws of social development gives our party the possibility to confidently lead the Soviet people towards communism. Knowledge of objective laws is the basis of the large-scale work of transforming nature that is being carried out in our country. Soviet science has played a prominent role in accomplishing this task.
    Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" encourages scientific workers to further fight for advanced material science and strive to create for the happiness of the people.

    反对自然科学中的主观主义歪曲
    苏联  尤·日丹诺夫
    斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”对于先进的唯物主义的科学的发展，对于与非科学的、唯心主义的观点的各种表现作斗争，具有极大的意义。这不仅是对社会科学而言，对自然科学也
    一样。
    斯大林同志在他的著作中指出了某些经济学家的立场的错误，这些经济学家否认科学法则的客观性质，企图这样设想，似乎科学法则可以按照人们的意志来废除或改造。这种观点直接引向主观主义唯心论的泥潭。斯大林同志批评了抱着这种见解的人们，强调了马克思主义理论的这一个原则性的论点：“马克思主义把科学法则——无论是指自然科学法则或政治经济学法则都一样——了解为不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，但是人们不能改变或废除这些法则，尤其不能制定或创造新的科学法则。”（斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”，中译本人民出版社版第二页。）
    在这个深刻的定义里，以明确而扼要的形式提出了科学发展的最重要的结论。斯大林同志所规定的定义强调了自然现象和社会生活的规律性，揭明了科学法则的客观性质和这些法则的可认识性。这个定义反对对法则的消极的理解，反对把法则偶像化。同时斯大林同志又给了科学中的以各种形态表现出来的主观主义致命的打击。
    几十年来，马克思列宁主义科学的伟大的创造者们一直坚持了并且发展了对于科学法则的性质的这种理解，揭露了各色各样的唯心论者。唯心论宇宙观的表现形式之一便是科学中的主观主义，即剥夺自然法则和社会法则的客观内容的意图，在科学中用某种主观主义方法来代替客观的科学的认识方法的企图。
    列宁和斯大林揭露自由派民粹主义者、社会革命党人、无政府主义者、经验批判论者的反科学的学说的斗争，是反对科学中的主观主义观点斗争的经典的范例。大家知道，以米海洛夫斯基为首的民粹主义者否认客观研究方法可以运用到社会生活现象上来。他们把社会现象从“自然历史过程”的总和中割裂出来，要求创造特别的“社会学中的主观主义方法”。这个方法归结起来说，就是要从人的思想和目的，从人的欲望、感觉、意愿的观点来研究历史现象。在这里，民粹主义者逃避了关于这些社会思想和目的的起源的问题，暴露了他们完全不懂得人们的社会存在对于人们的感觉、思想和欲望的决定作用。列宁揭露了民粹主义者的观点的错误，写道：“正如达尔文推翻了那认为动植物种类是彼此没有任何联系的偶然的‘神造的’不变的东西的观点，而第一次把生物学放置到完全是科学的基础上来，确定了各物种的变更性以及其间的继承性
    一样，马克思也推翻了那把社会看作是可按长官意志（或说按社会意志和政府意志，这横竖都是一样）来随便改变的，偶然产生和偶然变化的个人机械结合物的观点，而第一次把社会学放置到科学的基础上来，确定了社会经济形态是一定生产关系总和的概念，确定了这种形态发展过程是自然历史过程。”
    （“列宁文选”两卷集第一卷第九九——一○○页，莫斯科外文书籍出版局版。）
    不粉碎社会学中的主观主义就不能建立真正唯物主义的社会科学，就不能有作为我们党的政策的基础的科学预见。主观主义必然会使自己的拥护者陷于偶然性的混乱的迷途，迷恋于空想，最后则在政治上犯冒险主义。
    与主观主义的各种表现作斗争，在自然科学部门中也具有重大的意义。自然科学的所有各个最重要的部门中，彻底的科学的、客观的研究方法的确立，乃是向作为唯心论的一种形式的主观主义观点作残酷斗争的结果。
    季米里亚节夫反对活力论者——植物学中的植物心理学家的所谓“心理学”方法的斗争是大家都知道的。这一种主观方法的拥护者竟谈论到植物的 “记忆”和“意愿”，植物的“心理”，企图用茎的朝向阳光的“本能的意愿”来说明植物的生长。
    高级神经活动生理学是先进的唯物主义科学反对主观主义的斗争的阵线中的重要的一员。这门科学的现代的成就应该归功于巴夫洛夫院士。当巴夫洛夫发表了他的著名的演讲“自然科学与大脑”，在这篇演讲中坚持了生理学中的客观方法的时候，季米里亚节夫写了下面的几句话给他：
    “我不得不与许多年老的和年轻的、俄国的和德国的植物学家进行不断的斗争，他们宣传着什么生理学家应当拒绝‘自然科学思惟的严格规则’，而代之以一种什么幸而现在还不存在的植物心理学的胡说。现在，当我可以指出，像你这样的‘俄罗斯土地上的伟大的生理学家’都宣告了以把心理学方法从它在生理学中的最后的堡垒中驱逐出去为自己的任务的时候，我感到脚底下踏实了，可以给它以进一步的反击了。”
    巴夫洛夫在他的著作里不只一次地强调过所谓主观方法的没有结果和关于精神的一般议论的毫无用处，他要求对人类和动物的行为的所有各个方面作彻底唯物的、严格客观的分析，同时绝不无视这个任务的困难。他批评了主观主义者的方法，这些主观主义者运用关于动物底感觉和欲望的假定，或者企图在自身观察的基础上建立生理学和心理学。巴夫洛夫写道：“研究各种现象的主观方法从世界上出现第一个人的时候起就存在了，它究竟给了我们什么呢？什么也没有。凡是凭借主观方法捏造出来的一切都必需予以摧毁并建立新的。”
    巴夫洛夫的客观方法遭到了具有唯心主义情绪的学者们的公开攻击。正如民粹主义者藉口社会现象的特点，要求在社会学中废除客观方法一样，在生理学中，也有人藉口人类高级神经活动的特点，要求拒绝客观方法。作为生理学中的主观主义歪曲的基础的，是关于“精神”的无法克服的概念，关于某种莫名其妙的、无法认识的“心理的”本质的概念，对于这些东西，严格科学的、客观的研究的通常的准则不能运用。
    巴夫洛夫生理学的最积极的反对者是奥尔别里院士，以及别利托夫院士、阿诺兴教授和其他几个生理学家，他们在苏联科学院和医学科学院一九五○年所召开的关于生理学问题的联合会议上遭到了科学界的批评。奥尔别里院士伪造巴夫洛夫学说，把客观方法解释为局限的、片面的方法，并且号召为了“克服”这种局限性，要用主观方法来补足它。他写到，“生理学家为了要建立中枢神经系活动的基本法则，必需同时运用主观的研究方法与客观的研究方法”。应当指出，这种观点至今仍在生理学家之间流行着。
    唯物主义的生理学家把消灭主观主义残余当作自己的迫切任务，不解决这个问题就不能沿着创造性地发展巴夫洛夫生理学的道路成功地向前推进。
    主观主义观点之侵入化学科学也带来了巨大的危害。在化学中，这一类的思想在所谓中介论或共振论的名目下获得了自己独特的表现，这种理论在原则上与布特列洛夫的唯物主义理论相对立，后者认为，学者通过观察、经验和思维可以认识分子中原子间的客观存在着的关系，并且可以把这种关系反映在结构式中。
    布特列洛夫的化学结构理论在研究化合物的结构的时候以现实的、客观的化学关系为根据，而共振论者则建议以这样的思想为指导：即根据关于原子的化学价的某种教条，怎样的一些结构式可以用来描述一种特定的化合物。之后，分子的真正结构被解释为介于几个分明不反映任何现实的，仅仅用来描述的结构式之中的结构（中介的或共振着的结构）。这种伪科学的理论的创始人之一，美国的化学家威兰德承认：“共振思想是一种人为的概念，其人为的程度比其他物理理论更深。它不反映分子本身的任何内在特性，只是物理学家和化学家为了自己的便利而发明出来的数学方法。”威兰德既已宣布共振是没有物理意义的虚构，却仍然郑重其事地来研究“共振对于分子的物理特性和化学特性的影响”问题。
    从实证主义哲学那里剽窃过来的把科学结果当作描述事实的便利方法的解释，是培养化学中的主观主义的温床。很早以来，不可知论的化学家就认为，科学不能认识化学反应的本质和分子结构，化学式的用处仅仅在于便利地描述化学变化。这自然就产生了科学中的任意性，同时把上十个，成百个化学式归之于一种物质，因而使得化合物的合成方法困难起来。共振论者连同其主观主义观点一起陷入了混乱与偶然性的王国之中，号召化学家追随
    “妙不可言的本能”，“直觉”，换句话说，就是要求拒绝科学。
    苏联化学家进行了反对共振论的斗争，但是，并不是随时都揭露了这一理论的主观主义根源。
    现代物理学的发展也是在向主观主义在这一知识部门中的各种表现作斗争中前进的。康德主义的浪潮使得主观主义的观点弥漫于物理学中，一如其弥漫于其他自然科学部门中一样，这种康德主义正是帝国主义反动势力在科学战线上的最重要的武器。列宁在他的天才著作“唯物论与经验批判论”中无情地批判了马赫主义者、经验批判论者以及被他们弄糊涂了的物理学家们的主观主义观点。
    脱离客观研究方法的倾向，强烈地表现在资本主义世界的现代物理学中。例如，著名的物理学家波尔表示，在原子物理学中“客体和主体之间不可能有任何严格的区分”。英国的天文学家爱丁顿写道，物理学的法则和常数完全都是主观的，可以先验地引进来。
    另一个物理学家约丹竟说出了这样的意见：物理实验中的研究者并不是在研究客观现实，而是在“准备物理学的现实”。这种观点在苏联的科学文献中也有些流行，特别是在物理学家马尔科夫的著作中，他写道，似乎量子理论的物理学的现实包含了人的积极活动的因素，它从属于人的活动。马尔科夫认为，把人的活动包括在物理学的现实的概念中，就表明了科学认识的力量和作用。可是实际上，这种观点却引起了破坏物理科学的客观内容，剥夺了实践的正确指南，并且也降低了人类认识的力量。
    物理学中的所谓相对论的结果也遭到了不正确的、主观主义的解释。相对论者把空间、时间、因果律这些范畴解释为直觉的几种形式，解释为与意识不能分开的东西。爱因斯坦在他的一本关于相对论的著作中说：“每一个人都有他自己的主观时间”。这些议论以及诸如此类的许多议论，证明在那些被马赫主义哲学从严格科学的，客观的研究方法立场引入迷途的物理学家们脑子里是一片混乱。现代物理学的成就，反驳了主观主义者、马赫主义者、不可知论者的观点，证明了科学的客观性质、自然过程的可认识性和科学透入到世界的最深的秘密之处的能力。
    先进的唯物主义的科学反对主观主义理论及其他唯心主义理论的斗争，归根结底就是两种不可调和的阶级力量——工人阶级和资产阶级，社会主义与资本主义的历史性的斗争的表现之一。以美国资产阶级为首的帝国主义反动势力，力图维护自己的阶级利益，不惜利用任何反动的、唯心的、敌视科学的思想来与唯物论作斗争。在科学部门中，反动势力大肆叫嚣着最新的实证主义和马赫主义，宣布进军反对客观真理，反对唯物地理解世界，反对自然现象和社会现象的可认识性。
    不能不看到，这种观点也侵入了苏联科学。在这里，个别的学者凭藉术语的诡计，企图在马克思主义的外衣下进行伪造，正如当年马克思主义的显明的反对者波格达诺夫企图把自己的马赫主义观点冒充为马克思主义一样，现代的主观主义在我们今天的条件下，是以藉口这种或那种被研究的现象的特点和性质上的特色，而力图“稍微修正”、“补充”客观科学方法为特点的。
    在一切知识部门中，主观主义都是真正科学的敌人。主观主义和科学不能并存。实际上并没有任何一种科学发展能够以“主观方法”作为真正基础的；科学只知道一种唯一的有效的、严格的客观研究方法，这种方法到处都证明了是有效的：无论是在社会学中和物理学中，在生理学中和化学中，在心理学中和地质学中。当然，这一点也没有否认每一种知识部门都有它自己特殊的研究方法，都有它自己的专门的规律性。斯大林同志在“马克思主义与语言学问题”“苏联社会主义经济问题”这些著作中指明了社会现象的专门规律性的极重要的意义，强调了忽视这种专门性便会犯极大的错误。同时，一切现象的专门性本身即要求从唯物主义科学的立场来作客观分析。
    运用客观科学方法可以揭露自然和社会的规律性，不承认、不研究这些规律性任何科学都不能发展。在已经获得的知识的基础上发展了人类的实践，利用了自然力为社会谋福利，限制了自发的破坏作用。斯大林同志在其著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出了：“因此，当人们讲到‘征服’自然力量或经济力量，讲到‘控制’它们等等的时候，他们决不是想说：人们能够‘消灭’科学法则或‘制定’科学法则。恰恰相反，他们只是想以此来说明，人们能够发现法则，认识它们，掌握它们，学会以完备的知识去运用它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，从而征服它们，求得控制它们。”（中译本人民出版社版第七页）
    社会发展的客观规律的知识给我们党以可能来满怀信心地领导苏联人民走向共产主义。客观规律的知识是在我们国内实现的大规模的改造自然工作的基础。在完成这一任务中苏联科学起了卓越的作用。
    斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”鼓舞了科学工作者进一步为先进的唯物科学而斗争，为人民的幸福而努力创造。
