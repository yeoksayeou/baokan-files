    Amateur Technical Training Class at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    There are many veteran technicians at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant. They possess a wealth of practical experience but lack the necessary scientific and technical theoretical knowledge. Steelmaking, however, involves chemical and physical changes and some mathematical calculations at almost every step. Many workers can only operate based on their experience, not understanding the underlying scientific principles. They know what to do, but not why. Consequently, accidents can easily occur during work, affecting steel production and quality.
    In April 1952, under the guidance of the company's Education Department and influenced by the technical learning atmosphere in other brother plants, the Steelmaking Plant began to organize workers to study technical theory in their spare time. In the past, whenever the idea of amateur learning was mentioned, the Steelmaking Plant, from top to bottom, would raise many difficulties: steelworkers work in three shifts, resulting in inconsistent spare time; the work is tiring, there are many meetings, and many people live far from the plant. Some also believed that without a junior high school education, it was impossible to learn the technical theory of steelmaking. All these problems have been appropriately resolved in this learning initiative. The plant assigned a technician as a full-time teacher for the amateur training class, teaching three times a day according to the different spare time schedules of the three shifts of workers. They also managed to free up some housing within the plant, allowing workers participating in the training to move in, saving them commuting time. Xiao Xiaoxin, the training class teacher, also conducted preliminary research on what to teach and how to teach. Based on the needs of steelmaking, the workers' education level, and actual knowledge (most of the participants were foremen and above from the open hearth furnace teams, with a fourth- or fifth-grade education), he compiled a set of teaching materials. The content included: junior high school chemistry related to steelmaking (approximately equivalent to the second year of junior high school); arithmetic operations, fractions, proportions, and linear equations in algebra; the heat section of junior high school physics and unit conversions for weights and measures; and finally, an introduction to basic metallurgy, including refractory materials, gas, open hearth furnace batching, deoxidation, and various calculation methods. These are all things that a steelworker must know and use frequently. During lectures, teacher Xiao Xiaoxin tried his best to connect with practical examples from the workers' production and lives, always starting from practical applications, avoiding circling around abstract principles, and paying attention to arousing the workers' interest. After each unit was taught, the workers were organized to discuss in relation to their own work, using the theoretical knowledge they had learned to explain the problems that occurred in their work. Sometimes, the workers were led to the site for practical exercises.
    Because the teaching materials met the actual needs of the workers and the teaching methods were relatively lively and flexible, the workers easily understood and remembered, and were very interested in learning. After learning in the classroom, the workers reviewed at any time and in any place in connection with their own work. In this way, they learned quickly, completing the planned teaching materials in just over three months (ten hours of class per week).
    After this learning experience, many workers at the Steelmaking Plant developed an interest and confidence in learning scientific and technical theory. Shi Xiugui, who had worked at the Steelmaking Plant for twelve years and was recently promoted from worker to technician, initially felt that he was too old, his brain wasn't working well, and he wouldn't be able to remember physics and chemistry. After two months of learning, his views completely changed. He said: "I originally had practical experience, and now I have theory. When the two are combined, it's easy to understand and easy to remember." For example, when repairing the bottom of a steel furnace, dolomite is required, and black dolomite is not allowed. Before learning, he never understood why, and sometimes he used black dolomite. He thought that since they were both dolomite, just different colors, it wouldn't make a difference which one was used. After learning, he realized that black dolomite contains tar. When applied to the furnace bottom and burned, it would produce carbon dioxide, which would cause the furnace bottom to shorten its life due to incomplete sintering. He would never forget this principle. Shi Xiugui used to be confused about many things he did by hand, not knowing the underlying principles. After learning, he said: "It's like opening a window in my heart, like having a road, no longer like being trapped in a muffled gourd." Therefore, he became more and more interested in learning. He went to the same class twice in a row; sometimes he took the exam twice; he discussed with others at work, and sometimes he proactively explained things to others. He said that using his brain could increase his knowledge. He felt that learning was like watching a movie, he wanted to learn more after learning. He promoted to the veteran workers: "Learning doesn't depend on age, it depends on whether you are willing to learn."
    The establishment of the training class has launched a wave of technical learning in the Steelmaking Plant. Many workers are learning while walking, and sometimes they start discussing while eating. Gao Xianzai, a young steelworker, is conducting amateur learning in this way: he carries some scraps of paper with notes from class in his pocket, and takes them out to read while walking and eating. When working, he uses the free time during open hearth furnace operation to review, correlating it with practice. If he doesn't understand something, he asks the technician. Sometimes he draws chemical symbols all over the ground. When working the night shift, he works from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning, and then has to attend a meeting after work. When he gets back to his dormitory, it's already around 9:00 AM, and he's already a little drowsy. But he still takes out his lecture notes and reviews them for an hour. He said: "Once I start studying, my energy comes back." After studying, he eats, sleeps at around 10:00 AM, and at 4:00 PM, when he's sleeping soundly, the training class bell rings. He said: "No matter how sleepy I am at this time, when I hear the bell, it's like encountering a major event. I get a jolt in my heart, turn over, and get up." After studying in the training class until 6:00 PM, he has dinner and then takes the time to review what he just learned. At around 7:00 PM, he walks to an open space for half an hour. At this time, he breathes in the cool night air, thinks about nothing, and lets his brain rest well. After walking back, he sleeps for another two hours, and gets up at 10:00 PM to go to work. Gao Xianzai originally only had three years of education. When he first joined the training class, he couldn't keep up and scored zero on the exam. After several months of hard work, at the end of the training class, his exam score reached 100%.
    The practical effects of the training class can be seen from the progress of the workers' operating skills. Furnace foreman Wang Zhenjia is a well-known fast steelmaking expert in the plant. He said: "I also admit that I was a good furnace foreman in the past, but I only operated rigidly according to the simple clauses of the operating regulations and my own old experience. I didn't understand the underlying scientific principles, so I couldn't handle problems based on the ever-changing conditions inside the furnace." For example, to ensure proper alkalinity in the furnace during steelmaking, lime (calcium oxide) must be added to the furnace. How much lime should be added for each heat of steel? In the past, he did it based on experience, five troughs for a large furnace, three troughs for a small furnace. He did not understand that the amount of lime added depends on the amount of silicic acid contained in the iron, ore, manganese ore, and other materials. Sometimes the silicic acid content was high, but he still added three or five troughs of lime as usual, resulting in low alkalinity, which not only prolonged the melting time but also shortened the life of the furnace body. After learning, Wang Zhenjia understood the principles of many such daily operating problems and no longer made empiricist mistakes. Wang Zhenjia said that after learning, the time he spent making a heat of steel was reduced by an average of about one hour, which is a very significant achievement. Some workers said that in the past they did not understand that air contains oxygen, which helps combustion. When they found that the furnace roof was melting due to excessive temperature inside the furnace, they opened the large air pipe, wanting to lower the temperature inside the furnace, but the effect was just the opposite. The furnace burned even more fiercely, and the furnace roof melted even more severely. In the past, many workers, due to a lack of the necessary scientific knowledge, found it difficult to understand every time the steelmaking operating regulations were explained, and therefore could not implement them well in their work. The newly revised operating regulations of the Steelmaking Plant in the winter of 1952 were more advanced in operating technology than in the past. The new operating regulations not only include operating methods and some basic principles, but also absorb the Soviet Union's advanced fast steelmaking experience. When studying these operating regulations, most of the workers who had studied in the amateur technical training class could understand them, take notes, and speak the most during discussions; many workers who had not studied in the training class found it difficult at every step. Xie Yupiao and Shi Xiugui were both technicians promoted from workers. Xie Yupiao's education level was originally higher than Shi Xiugui's, but he did not participate in the training class. When studying the operating regulations, he got a headache as soon as he heard chemical terms and physical changes. Shi Xiugui not only studied well himself, but also helped others. This shows that three or four months of teaching in the Steelmaking Plant's amateur technical training class can enable a steelworker to learn the basic scientific and technical theoretical knowledge that is necessary for their work. After learning the operating regulations last winter, more than 20 workers at the Steelmaking Plant automatically requested to participate in the amateur training class.
    The effectiveness of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant's amateur technical training class shows that if the teaching materials meet the needs of the workers and the teaching methods are appropriate, workers can quickly learn the scientific and technical theoretical knowledge necessary for their work in their spare time, combined with their own work and practical experience. For many workers, this kind of learning is urgent. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have repeatedly stated that their lack of basic scientific and technical theoretical knowledge has caused many losses in their work. At present, many factory and mine leaders are only accustomed to using general appeals, meetings, and launching competitions to improve production, but do not pay attention to how to seriously and systematically improve the scientific and technical knowledge of workers. This approach should be changed.
    Of course, the amateur technical training class at the Steelmaking Plant has only been running for a short time, the results are only preliminary, and there are still shortcomings that need to be overcome urgently. For example, there are too many meetings, which affect the workers' learning time; workers who miss classes cannot keep up, and the training class lacks help for them, leading to many workers stopping learning halfway. These problems need to be appropriately resolved by the leaders of the Steelmaking Plant so that the amateur technical training class can be further consolidated and improved.

    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂的业余技术学习班
    本报记者林沫
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂有很多老技工，他们有丰富的实际操作经验，但缺乏必要的科学技术理论知识，而炼钢这件事，几乎步步离不开化学、物理变化和一些数学计算。有很多工人只能根据自己的经验操作，不懂其中的科学道理，知其然而不知其所以然，因此，工作中就容易发生事故，影响钢的产量和质量。
    一九五二年四月，炼钢厂在公司教育处的指导和其他兄弟厂技术学习空气的影响下，开始组织工人利用业余时间，学习技术理论。过去一提到业余学习，炼钢厂从上到下都会提出很多困难：炼钢工人是三班操作，业余学习时间不一致，工作累，开会多，有很多人还住的离厂很远；还有些人认为，没有初中的文化程度，根本谈不上学炼钢的技术理论，等等。这些问题，在这次学习中都获得了适当的解决。厂里抽出一个技术员作业余学习班的专任教师，按三班工人不同的业余时间，每天分三次上课；又设法在厂内腾出一部分房子，让参加学习的工人都搬到厂内住，节省了上下班走路的时间。学习班教师萧孝亲对教什么和如何教的问题，也预先作了调查研究。他根据炼钢的需要、工人的文化程度和实际知识水平（参加学习的绝大部分是平炉班长以上的工人，有四、五年的文化程度），编选了一套教材。教材内容包括：和炼钢有关的初中化学
    （约等于初中二年的课程）；算术四则、分数、比例及代数一次方程式；初中物理的热学部分及度量衡的单位换算；最后一部分是常用的初步冶金学，包括耐火材料、煤气及平炉配料、脱氧等各种计算方法。这些都是一个炼钢工人所必须知道和常用的东西。在讲课的时候，教师萧孝亲尽量联系工人生产和生活中的实际事例，处处从实用出发，避免在抽象的原则上打圈子，注意引起工人的兴趣。每讲完一个单元之后，就组织工人联系自己的工作进行讨论，运用学得的理论知识，说明工作中所发生的问题，有时还领着工人到现场实习。
    因为教材切合工人的实际需要，教学方法又比较生动、活泼，所以工人就容易领会和记忆，对学习很有兴趣。工人在课堂学习了，又结合着自己的工作，随时随地进行复习。这样学习得便很快，三个多月（每周上课十小时）就把预定的教材学完了。
    经过这次学习，炼钢厂有很多工人对科学技术理论的学习有了兴趣和信心。在炼钢厂工作过十二年、最近由工人提升为技术员的石修贵，初参加学习时，总觉得自己年纪大，脑筋不行了，什么物理、化学的，学了也记不住。这次学习了两个月，他的看法就完全不同了，他说：“自己原来有实际，现在有了理论，两方面一结合，好懂，又好记。”比如补炼钢炉的炉底，规定用白云石，不许用黑云石。在学习以前，他一直不懂是什么道理，有时就用了黑云石。他以为反正都是云石，只不过是颜色不同，用那种还不是一样。经过学习，他才懂得，黑云石里边有焦油，补到炉底上，经过燃烧，会发生二氧化炭，这就会使炉底因烧结不严密而缩短寿命。这个道理他永远也不会忘记。石修贵过去对很多手里作的事情，心里总是迷迷糊糊的，不知道是什么道理，经过学习，他说：“心里像开了窗户，像有条马路，再不像过去那样装在闷葫芦里了。”因此，他对学习越来越有兴趣，同样的课，他一连去听两次；有时，考试他也参加两次；工作时和别人互相讨论，有时还主动地向别人讲述。他说，动一动脑筋，就能增加新的知识。他觉得学习像看电影一样，学了还想学。他到处向老工人宣传：“学习决不在年纪大小，就看你肯学不肯学。”
    学习班的开办，使炼钢厂展开了学习技术的热潮。有很多工人，走路也在学，有时吃着饭就讨论起来。青年炼钢工人高贤再是这样进行业余学习的：他口袋里装着上课时所记的一些纸条条，在走路、吃饭的时候也拿出来念。工作的时候，他利用平炉操作的空闲时间进行复习，和实际相印证，不懂的就问技术员。有时他在地下划满了化学符号。上夜班的时候，他从夜晚十一点工作到第二天早上七点钟，下班后还要开会，回到宿舍已经九点来钟，这时，精神已经有些迷迷糊糊，但他照例还要拿出讲义复习一个钟头。他说：“一学习起来，精神就又来了。”学习完了，吃过饭，十点多钟睡觉，到下午四点钟，正是睡得正甜的时候，学习班上课的铃响了。他说：“这时无论多么困，一听到铃响，像遇到大事一样，心里一惊，翻身就起来了。”在学习班学习到六点钟，下课吃了饭，他还要抓紧时间把刚学过的功课复习一遍。到七点多钟，他走到一个空场上散步半小时。这时，他呼吸着夜晚清凉的空气，什么也不想，让自己的脑子好好休息一下。散步回去，再睡上两小时，十点钟起来去上班。高贤再原只有三年的文化程度，初参加学习班时跟不上，考试得零分，经过几个月的苦学，学习班结束时，他考试的成绩达到百分。
    从工人操作技术的进步上，可以看出学习班的实际效果。炉长王振甲是全厂著名的快速炼钢能手。他说：“我也承认，过去我是一个好炉长，但我只是死板地根据操作规程的简单条文和自己的老经验进行操作，不明白其中的科学道理，也就不能根据炉内千变万化的情况处理问题。”譬如：炼钢时为使炉内有适当的碱度，要往炉里加石灰（氧化钙）。炼一炉钢需要加多少石灰呢？过去他是根据经验办事，大炉子加五槽子，小炉子加三槽子。他不明白石灰加入的多少，是根据铁水、矿石、锰矿石等材料中所含矽酸的多少来决定的。有时矽酸含的多，加入的石灰照例还是三槽或五槽，这就造成碱度过低，不但延长熔炼时间，还要缩短炉体的寿命。很多这样一些日常的操作问题，王振甲经过学习之后，懂得了它的原理，便不再犯经验主义的错误了。王振甲说，经过学习，他炼一炉钢的时间平均约缩短一小时，这一成绩是十分重大的。有的工人，讲他过去不了解空气里边含氧气，会帮助燃烧，当他发现炉内因温度过高，炉顶发生熔化现象的时候，他就开大空气管，想把炉内的温度吹低，但所得的效果恰恰相反，炉子却烧得更凶，炉顶熔化的更厉害了。很多工人，过去因为缺乏应有的科学知识，每逢遇到讲解炼钢操作规程的时候，都很难听懂，在工作中也就不能很好地执行。炼钢厂在一九五二年冬季新修订的操作规程，在操作技术上比过去提高了。新操作规程不仅包括操作方法和某些基本原理，还吸收了苏联先进的快速炼钢经验。在学习此项操作规程时，在业余技术学习班学习过的工人，绝大部分人都能听得懂，能记笔记，在讨论时也发言最多；没有在学习班学习的工人，很多人步步感到困难。谢玉朴和石修贵两人都是由工人提升的技术员。谢玉朴的文化程度原来比石修贵还高一些，但他没有参加学习班学习，在学习操作规程时，一听到化学名词、物理变化就头痛。石修贵不但自己学习的好，还可以帮助别人。这说明，炼钢厂业余技术学习班三、四个月的教学，可以使一个炼钢工人学习到工作中必须具备的、初步的科学技术理论知识。炼钢厂在去年冬季学过操作规程以后，又有二十多个工人自动要求参加业余学习班学习。
    鞍钢炼钢厂业余技术学习班的成效说明：如果教材切合工人的需要，教学得法，工人结合自己的工作和实际经验，可以利用业余时间，迅速地学到工作所必需的科学技术理论知识。而这种学习，对很多工人来说，又是急不容缓的。鞍钢炼钢厂的工人就一再说明，由于自己缺乏基本的科学技术理论知识，使工作受到了不少损失。而目前很多厂矿的领导干部，只是习惯于用一般性的号召，开会，发动竞赛等办法来提高生产，却不注意如何认真地、有计划地提高工人的科学技术知识。这种作法，已到应该改变的时候了。
    当然，炼钢厂的业余技术学习班开办的时间还很短，成绩仅是初步的，还存在着急待克服的缺点。如各种会议过多，影响工人的学习时间，工人缺了课跟不上，学习班对他们又缺乏帮助，以致不少工人中途停止学习，等等。这些问题，都需要炼钢厂的领导方面加以适当的解决，以便使业余技术学习班更加巩固和完善。
