The Chinese Communist Party Hebei Provincial Committee's conference on handling typical cases of opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline (see page one of this newspaper on the 7th) was conducted under the direction of Comrade Liu Lantao of the North China Bureau. Regarding the serious violations of law and discipline, rape of women, control of the masses, extortion, and embezzlement and waste by the cadres of Taidi Village, Yi County, led by Niu Laolian (deputy secretary of the village branch), Comrade Liu Lantao personally wrote a letter to the Hebei Provincial Committee in December of last year, pointing out that the nature of the Taidi Village incident was serious and must be dealt with promptly and should not be delayed any longer. The letter also criticized the Hebei leadership for intolerable bureaucracy, especially for not believing the masses' accusations and for delaying handling the matter. Comrade Liu Lantao pointed out that "although the Three-Anti Movement has achieved great results, the anti-bureaucracy effort has not been thorough enough." Therefore, he suggested that the Hebei Provincial Committee "convene a provincial committee meeting to formally discuss the Niu Laolian incident, adopt a high-profile approach to handling it, and deal with the leadership organs involved in the case that have committed bureaucratic errors." He also demanded that "the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline be carried out in a planned way in conjunction with current work."

The discovery of the illegal and disciplinary violations of Niu Laolian and others in Taidi Village, Yi County, occurred relatively early. In February 1950, Comrade Zhao Yachen of Taidi Village (now working at the Datong City Construction Company) reported the crimes of Niu Laolian and other bad elements to the CCP Yi County Committee. Since Niu Laolian and others seized the organizational leadership of Taidi Village, they regarded Taidi Village as their own "independent kingdom," controlling the village's Party branch, village people's government, and grassroots organizations of people's groups as tools to control and oppress the masses. The main cadres in the village were all Niu Laolian's informants. Branch Secretary Niu Laoda was his cousin, Branch Organization Committee Member Niu Tingzhi was his nephew, Village Chief Niu Laoyou was his cousin, and Village Education Committee Member Niu Laozhou was his brother; others such as the militia captain and the Youth League branch secretary were all close relatives of Niu Laolian. Niu Laolian openly said at one meeting: "Look how good we are! Not only can people with other surnames not raise their heads, but even the two branches of Niu Quanyuan can't raise their heads; we have people to speak for us and people to fight, and the Jiangshan is as stable as an iron bucket." This anti-Party and anti-people clique used its power to oppress the masses, violate laws and discipline, and do whatever it wanted.

Niu Laolian and others' most prominent crime was using their power to wantonly rape women. Niu Laolian alone raped more than 30 people. Others such as militia instructor Chen Zhongqi, Branch Secretary Niu Laoda, and Village Chief Niu Laoyou also raped multiple women.

The group of bad elements led by Niu Laolian consistently extorted and became overlords riding on the people's heads. During festivals, from the first day of the first month to the second day of the second month, the villagers had to take turns inviting these bad elements to eat. During the busy farming season, Niu Laolian ordered the masses to work for him, giving them little or no wages, and sometimes not even feeding them. In 1949, Niu Laolian seized a mountain villa belonging to Niu Laokuan's wife for 180 yuan, forcing Niu Laokuan's wife and children to become displaced and their whereabouts are still unknown. Niu Laolian adopted various methods to extort the masses. For example, when his brother-in-law's child had its "full moon" celebration, Niu Laolian shamelessly forced the masses to contribute gifts and even ordered the village opera troupe to perform to congratulate. Village Chief Niu Laoyou forcibly occupied the primary school building and bought Liu Laocai's horses at a low price. In addition, Niu Laolian and others consistently undermined the Party's policies, and as early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they forced farmers to terminate their leases, helped landlords take back tenant land from farmers, and profited from it. He also took the lead in concealing land, evading agricultural taxes, embezzling public grain and funds, embezzling the fruits of struggle, and colluding with Niu Fangzhi to embezzle 70,000 catties of lime. When distributing relief grain, they gave it to whomever they "liked" and not to those they "disliked." The opposite was true when assigning corvée labor. Therefore, the masses said, "grain for those we like, corvée for those we dislike."

The masses and some cadres of Taidi Village had waged just struggles against the heinous crimes of the anti-Party and anti-people clique of Niu Laolian and others, but they were all subjected to retaliation or conspiracies by Niu Laolian and other bad elements. In 1948, farmer Chen Laojun went to the district to accuse Niu Laolian, and the district cadre Zhao Laoshu (a degenerate element) immediately said: "How many heads do you have? How dare you accuse Niu Laolian!" Chen Laojun asked: "Does the district know that Niu Laolian is embezzling and concealing black land?" Zhao Laoshu said even more unreasonably: "Which granary doesn't have mice?" Angered, Chen Laojun glared and returned, never reporting the situation to the district again. In the same year, Qi Guoyuan, a district assistant, discovered some of the evil deeds of Niu Laolian and others while working in Taidi Village. He prepared to go deep among the masses to collect materials to fight against the Niu Laolian and other bad element groups. After Niu Laolian discovered this, he stole the name of the "Poor Peasants' Corps" and falsely accused Qi Guoyuan of molesting women in the village, and Qi Guoyuan was transferred away by the district leadership. The people of the Zhai and Chen surnames in Taidi Village had constantly reported the illegal and disciplinary violations of the village cadres to the outside world, and Niu Laolian and others used the opportunity of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to falsely accuse farmers Zhai Laozhi, Chen Laoman, Chen Laoyin, and Chen Laohuan of being "spies."

The long-term failure to expose the Taidi Village incident reflected the serious bureaucracy of the county and district leadership. Since joining the Party and participating in village work in 1940, Niu Laolian had always been selfish, violated laws and discipline, and oppressed the masses. He believed that being a cadre was for getting rich and making connections. However, the district leadership had always been satisfied with Niu Laolian's ability to "complete work tasks" and had never checked how he completed his work. According to district party secretary Zhang Chunyuan, it was always believed in the past that Taidi Village was an old revolutionary base area, the work was very good, and Niu Laolian and others were veteran cadres who could complete their tasks, so Taidi Village was regarded as a "model village."

Although Comrade Zhao Yachen had long filed a complaint against the criminal behavior of Niu Laolian and others, it did not attract the attention of the CCP Yi County Committee. In October 1951, Comrade Zhao Yachen again filed a complaint with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee. The Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee did not pay enough attention to such a shocking and major case, but only allowed the Provincial People's Procuratorate to transfer it level by level to the Baoding Branch Procuratorate for handling, without asking or investigating the results. It was not until May 1952, when Comrade Zhao Yachen complained to Comrade Liu Lantao of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, that Liu Lantao instructed the CCP Baoding Prefectural Committee to investigate and handle the matter. Later, after three investigations by the Yi County Committee for Discipline Inspection, the Yi County People's Procuratorate, the People's Court, and the Baoding Special Zone Procuratorate Branch, some people turned back halfway during the investigation, some people sat in the county people's government waiting for reports, and some people were still spinning around in Niu Laolian's hands when they arrived in the village. As a result, not only did they fail to clarify the truth, but they made wrong conclusions, believing that "Niu Laolian is active in his work, supported by the masses, and basically possesses the eight conditions of a Party member," and accused the complainant of "falsely accusing village cadres and should be given due punishment." They gave this report to the North China Bureau. The North China Bureau then spoke with the complainant and found many suspicious points in the reports of the Baoding Prefectural Committee and the Yi County Committee. Therefore, it sent a special person to organize a work group with the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee, Baoding Prefectural Committee, and Yi County Committee to investigate in Taidi Village. The results proved that most of the materials complained by Comrade Zhao Yachen were facts, and that Niu Laolian's crimes were even more numerous and serious than those revealed in the complaint materials. On October 25, 1952, the North China Bureau transferred the investigation report of the inspection team to the Hebei Provincial Committee for investigation and punishment, but the Hebei Provincial Committee backlogged the report for two months without processing it or asking for instructions or reporting it, until Comrade Liu Lantao personally wrote a letter before it attracted the attention of the Hebei Provincial Committee. This strict handling of the Taidi Village incident in Yi County by the Hebei Provincial Committee can not only educate cadres at all levels in the province, but also promote the rapid development of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline throughout the province.

    中共河北省委处理“台底村事件”的经过
    中国共产党河北省委员会的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的典型案件处理大会（见七日本报一版）是在华北局刘澜涛同志指示下进行的。刘澜涛同志为易县台底村干部以牛老连（村支部副书记）为首的严重违法乱纪、奸淫妇女、统治群众、敲诈勒索、贪污浪费的事件，曾于去年十二月亲自写信给河北省委，指出台底村事件性质严重，必须迅速处理，绝不应再事拖延。信中并指责河北领导机关存在着不可容忍的官僚主义，特别是不相信群众的检举、控告，及拖延不处理的错误。刘澜涛同志指出：“三反运动虽已获得很大成绩，但对官僚主义反得不透”，因此，他建议河北省委：“召开省委会议，正式讨论牛老连事件，采用大张旗鼓的处理方式，对与此案有关而犯有官僚主义错误的领导机关亦一并加以处理。”并要求“结合当前工作有计划地开展反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争。”
    易县台底村牛老连等违法乱纪事件发现较早，一九五○年二月，台底村赵亚震同志（现在大同市建筑公司工作）就向中共易县委员会揭发了牛老连等坏分子的罪行。自牛老连等窃夺了台底村的组织领导权以后，就把台底村当成了自己的“独立王国”，控制了村的党支部和村人民政府、人民团体的基层组织，作为自己统治欺压群众的工具。村里的主要干部都是牛老连的耳目。支部书记牛老达是他的堂兄，支部组织委员牛廷之是他的堂侄，村长牛老有是他的堂弟，村教育委员牛老周是他的亲兄；其他如民兵中队长、青年团支部书记等全是牛老连的近族。牛老连曾在一次会上明目张胆地说：“你看咱们多好呀！不光外姓抬不起头来，就连牛泉远的两支也抬不起头来；咱们有说话的，有打架的，江山稳的真像铁桶一样。”这一个反党反人民的小集团，就这样利用职权，百般欺压群众，违法乱纪，为所欲为。
    牛老连等最突出的罪行是利用职权，肆意奸污妇女。仅牛老连一人就奸污了三十余人。其他如民兵指导员陈仲起，支部书记牛老达和村长牛老有等也奸污妇女多人。
    以牛老连为首的坏分子集团，一贯敲诈勒索，成为骑在人民头上的恶霸；每逢年节，从正月初一到二月初二，村里群众必须轮流请这些坏分子吃饭。农忙时，牛老连叫群众给他作活，少给或不给工资，有时甚至连饭也不给吃。一九四九年牛老连就以一百八十元钱霸占了牛老宽之妻的一座山庄，逼得牛老宽的老婆孩子流离失所，至今下落不明。牛老连采取各种方法来勒索群众。例如他内弟的小孩过“满月”，牛老连也无耻地逼迫群众摊份子送礼，还令村剧团演戏祝贺。村长牛老有强占小学校舍，并低价强买刘老才的马匹。此外，牛老连等一贯破坏党的政策，早在抗日战争时期曾强迫农民解除租约，帮助地主向农民夺佃，自己从中渔利。他还带头隐瞒土地，偷漏农业税，贪污公粮、公款，贪污斗争果实，并与牛芳之合谋贪污石灰七万斤。在发放救济粮时，他们和谁“对眼”就给谁，“不对眼”的就不给。派差时则与此相反，凡与他们“对眼的”就不派差。因此，群众都说“对眼粮”“不对眼差”。
    台底村群众和某些干部，对牛老连等反党反人民的小集团的万恶罪行，曾进行过正义的斗争，但均遭到牛老连等坏分子的打击报复或阴谋陷害。一九四八年农民陈老均曾到区上控告过牛老连，区干部赵老树（蜕化分子）开口就说：“你长了几个脑袋？敢告牛老连！”陈老均问：“牛老连贪污、瞒黑地，区里是否知道？”赵老树更无理地说：“谁囤底下没有耗子啊？”气的陈老均怒目而回，再也不向区里反映情况了。同年，区助理员齐国元在台底村工作，发现了牛老连等的一些罪恶行为，他准备深入群众搜集材料，向牛老连等坏分子集团进行斗争。被牛老连发觉后，即盗用“贫农团”的名义，诬告齐国元在村里调戏妇女，齐国元即被区领导方面调走。台底村翟、陈两姓的人们曾不断的向外反映过村干部违法乱纪的情况，牛老连等竟借镇压反革命的机会，诬害农民翟老之、陈老满、陈老银、陈老焕等为“特务”。
    台底村的事件，长期未被揭发，反映了县区领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义。牛老连自一九四零年入党、参加村里工作后，一贯自私自利，违法乱纪，欺压群众，他认为当干部就是为了发财闹势力。但区里领导方面一直满足于牛老连能“完成工作任务”，从来没有检查过他的工作是怎样完成的。据区委书记张春元说，过去一向认为台底村是老区，工作很好，牛老连等是老干部，能完成任务，因此把台底村当作“模范村”。
    对牛老连等违法乱纪的罪恶行为，虽然赵亚震同志早已提出控诉，但并没有引起中共易县县委的重视。一九五一年十月，赵亚震同志又向中共河北省委纪律检查委员会控诉，省委纪律检查委员会对这样惊人的重大案件，也没有引起足够重视，只让省人民检察署转保定分署逐级转办，对结果如何又不问不究。直到一九五二年五月，赵亚震同志向中共中央华北局刘澜涛同志控诉，刘澜涛同志指示中共保定地委调查处理。以后经易县县委纪律检查委员会、易县人民政府检察署、人民法院与保定专区检察分署三次调查，在调查中，有的人半路折回，有的人到县人民政府坐等报告，有的人到了村里还在牛老连手心里打转，结果他们不仅没有弄清事实真相，反而作出了错误的结论，认为“牛老连工作积极，群众拥护，基本上具备了党员标准的八项条件”，并指斥控告人为“诬告村干部，应给以应得之处分。”他们把这样的报告给华北局。华北局又和控告人谈话，发现保定地委和易县县委的报告中疑点很多。遂派专人与中共河北省委、保定地委、易县县委组织了工作组，到台底村调查，结果证明了赵亚震同志控告的材料大部分是事实，并且牛老连的罪行较控告材料上所揭发的更多，情节更为严重。一九五二年十月二十五日华北局把检查组的调查报告转河北省委查处，而河北省委竟将报告积压两月，未加处理，也不请示报告，直至刘澜涛同志亲自写了信去，才引起了河北省委的注意。此次，河北省委对易县台底村事件的严正处理，不仅可以教育全省各级干部，并将推动反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，在全省范围内迅速开展。
