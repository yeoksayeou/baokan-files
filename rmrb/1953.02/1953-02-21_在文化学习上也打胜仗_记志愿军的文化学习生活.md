On the Korean front, what impressed me deeply was that the Chinese People's Volunteers, while bravely fighting the enemy, also seized the time to study culture.

In the company I visited, even in the tense combat environment, the higher authorities still assigned two platoon leaders from this company to study culture. Three days before New Year's Day this year, these two platoon leaders returned. It's hard to imagine the envy and joy with which the soldiers greeted them. The soldiers surrounded them, smiling, and the first thing they asked was, "Have you taken off your 'hats'?" The "hats" they were referring to was the inglorious title of "illiterate."

They were good at using the gaps in combat and work to study. One morning, I walked into a tunnel. I knew that the soldiers had spent the whole night repairing the工事 and transportation trenches damaged by the enemy's炮火, and thought they were all asleep, but there were still a few people reading and writing in the dim light. A young soldier told me that he was from Sichuan, and had only been in Korea as a volunteer for a few months. He had been oppressed by landlords since he was a child and could not afford to study. He said that now that he had such an opportunity to study, he would definitely live up to the expectations of the higher authorities. I asked him to write a few words in my notebook as a souvenir, and he quickly wrote: "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Country, Shan Changlong is determined."

In another tunnel, I saw a soldier named Luan Shuxing, who was representing his platoon in writing a letter of慰问 to the团's transportation company. The letter read:

"Dear comrades of the Transportation Company:

Happy New Year, and wish you good spirits and good health. Under the barrage of bullets and in the dark nights where you can't see the road, you constantly transport supplies from the rear to us. Now we are at the front, and we have no difficulty with ammunition and other things. This is all thanks to your disregard for yourselves, exchanging blood and sweat. You have worked hard. We thank you. Since entering the阵地, we have not made greater contributions to the people, and we feel ashamed. Now that the New Year is approaching, we have nothing to comfort you with, except to annihilate the enemy in large numbers in future battles and strive for greater victories to answer you. All comrades of the Second Platoon of the Fifth Company. December 28th."

The writer of this letter had not studied much before and could not write letters, but after studying, now, you see, he writes very fluently.

A cultural instructor told me that before the New Year, every comrade in their company wrote a New Year's letter to their families, and more than sixty of them wrote it themselves, while others were written by others. In the soldiers' letters, many also proposed to their families to carry out cultural learning competitions.

One day, I participated in a "little teacher" meeting convened by the cultural instructor. The discussion was about how to help those comrades whose minds were less灵活, so that they could catch up and advance together with everyone. After the meeting, the cultural instructor distributed four copies of "National Language Textbook," two sheets of glossy paper, and three candles to each of them, and asked them to forward them to all the comrades. The "little teachers" held these things, looked at them again and again with smiles on their faces, and flipped through them, showing great love.

The soldiers' enthusiasm for cultural learning is very high. The cultural instructor told me that for one week, Cen Yinglun was on roving sentry duty every night and only returned when it was about to dawn, but then he went to cultural class. The班长 asked him to rest, saying that the "little teacher" would give him a补课 in the afternoon, but he refused. Once, Jiang Guifa went out to attack the enemy at night and didn't sleep all night, but he still went to class as usual the next day. Luan Shuxing, in order to help his comrades study, made a blackboard out of ammunition boxes, batteries from flashlights, and bean oil used for lighting lamps in the tunnel under extremely difficult material conditions, so that he could write on it with chalk... Among all these stories, one thing especially moved me: one night, the roving sentry guarding the front of the阵地 discovered that the enemy had quietly climbed to an unnamed高地 only two hundred meters away from our 工事. He quickly ran back to report, and the连长 immediately ordered the Third Platoon Leader Hou Peixiang to prepare for a counterattack if the enemy continued to advance. After the 连长 checked the soldiers' combat readiness for a long time, the enemy still did not come. He was impatient and did not want to waste time in vain, so he said: "Everyone, take out your books and read them, seize the time to learn more."

    在文化学习上也打胜仗——记志愿军的文化学习生活
    王向立
    在朝鲜前线，使我感触很深的是，志愿军战士们一面英勇打击敌人，一面抓紧时间学习文化。
    在我去的那个连里，虽然在紧张的作战环境中，可是上级还是抽调了这个连的两个排长去学习文化。今年元旦前三天，这两个排长回来了。你很难想像战士们是怀着怎样羡慕和愉快的心情来迎接他们的。战士们围着他们，笑着，第一句话就问：“把‘帽子’摘掉了吧？”他们所说的“帽子”，就是“文盲”那个不光荣的称号。
    他们善于利用战斗和工作的空隙，进行学习。一天早晨，我走进一个坑道里。我知道战士们一整夜都在修补被敌人炮火所打坏的工事和交通壕，以为他们都睡了，可是仍然有几个人在微弱的灯光下看书写字。一个年青的战士告诉我，他是四川人，参加志愿军到朝鲜来还不过几个月，他从小就受地主的压迫，念不起书。他说他现在得到这样一个学习的机会，一定不辜负上级的期望。我请他在我的笔记本上写几句话留作纪念，他很敏捷地写了：“抗美援朝，保家卫国，陕昌隆有决心。”
    在另一个坑道里，我看见了一个战士名叫栾树兴的，正代表着他们这个排给团的运输连写慰问信呢。这封信写道：
    “亲爱的运输连全体同志们：
    新年快到了，祝你们精神愉快，身体健康。在枪林弹雨之下，在摸不见路的黑夜里，你们不断的把后方的物资运给我们。现在我们在前沿，弹药和其他东西都没有困难。这都是由于你们不顾自己，流血流汗换来的。你们辛苦了。我们感谢你们。自从进入阵地以来，我们没有给人民作出更大的贡献，很感惭愧。现在新年快到了，我们没有什么慰问你们，只有在今后的战斗中，大量歼灭敌人，争取更大的胜利来回答你们吧。五连二排全体同志上十二月二十八日”
    这封信的执笔人，从前没有念过什么书，不会写信，可是经过学习之后，现在，你看，已经写得很流利了。
    一个文化教员对我说，在新年前他们这个连里的每个同志都给家里写了一封贺年信，其中有六十多个人是自己亲自写的，其他则由别人代笔。在战士们的信中，有很多还向自己的家人提出进行学习文化竞赛。
    有一天，我参加了文化教员召开的“小先生”会议。讨论怎样帮助那些脑筋比较不灵活的同志们，使他们能够赶上去，和大家一道前进。会后，文化教员分发给他们每人四册“国语课本”、两张有光纸和三枝蜡烛，并请他们转发给全体同志们。“小先生”们拿着这些东西，面带笑容，看了又看，翻了又翻，显出极大的喜爱。
    战士们学习文化的热情是很高的。文化教员告诉我说，有一个星期，岑应伦每晚放游动哨，天快亮才回来，可是接着他又去上文化课了。班长叫他休息，说在下午让“小先生”给他补课，但他不肯。有一次，姜贵发在晚上出去袭击敌人，一夜没睡，第二天他还是照常上课。栾树兴为着帮助同志们学习，在物质十分困难的条件下，用装弹药的箱子、电筒里的电池和在坑道里点灯用的豆油做成一块黑板，好用粉笔在上面写字……在所有这些故事当中，有一件事特别使我感动：一天晚上，警戒在阵地前面的游动哨，发现敌人悄悄地爬到只距离我们工事二百公尺的无名高地上，他赶快跑回来报告，连长马上下命令叫三排长侯配祥准备反击，如果敌人继续前进的话。连长检查了战士们的战斗准备之后很久，敌人还没有来，他等得不耐烦，又不愿白白地浪费时间，于是就说：“大家都拿出书本来看吧，抓紧时间多学习一点。”
