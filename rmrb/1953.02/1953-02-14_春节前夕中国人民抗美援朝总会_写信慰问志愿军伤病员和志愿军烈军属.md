(Xinhua News Agency, February 13th) The China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea wrote letters on the eve of the Spring Festival to express condolences and respect to the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the families of martyrs and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter is as follows:
Comrades of the Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Comrades of the Families of Martyrs and Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army,

As the 1953 Spring Festival approaches, the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, on behalf of the people of the whole country, extends our cordial greetings and respect to you.

Comrades, you have gloriously directly participated in or actively encouraged your relatives to participate in the just war to resist America and aid Korea, giving the American aggressors a heavy blow and defending the security of the motherland and world peace. The people of the whole country are very grateful to you.

This year is the year when our country begins large-scale construction, and it is also the year when our country convenes the National People's Congress and the local People's Congresses at all levels to implement universal suffrage. At the same time, because American imperialism is attempting to expand the war of aggression and obstruct our country's construction, we must strengthen the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea and strive for the final victory of this struggle. The people of the whole country are working hard to victoriously complete these three major tasks. We hope that our dear wounded and sick comrades will rest assured, recover their health as soon as possible, and return to the front line to kill the enemy! We hope that our dear families of martyrs and soldiers, together with the people of the whole country, will actively participate in various construction works to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

In the "Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea" issued by the Committee on December 22nd last year, the people of the whole country were called upon to earnestly do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and to do everything possible to effectively help you overcome difficulties in medical treatment, recuperation, as well as in life and work. We hope you will rest assured, work hard, and wish you good health during the Spring Festival!

    当此一九五三年春节来临的时候，中国人民抗美援朝总会谨代表全国人民向你们致以亲切的慰问和敬意。
    同志们，你们曾光荣地直接参加了或积极地鼓励了你们的亲人参加抗美援朝的正义战争，给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击，保卫了祖国的安全与世界和平。全国人民对于你们是非常感激的。
    今年是我们祖国开始大规模建设的一年，也是我国召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会实行普选的一年；同时，由于美帝国主义妄图扩大侵略战争，阻挠我国的建设，所以我们必须加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争，争取这一斗争的最后胜利。全国人民正在为胜利完成这三大任务而努力。我们希望亲爱的伤病员同志们安心休养，早日恢复健康，重上前线杀敌！我们希望亲爱的烈属军属同志们同全国人民一道，积极参加各项建设工作，以支援中国人民志愿军。
    本会在去年十二月二十二日发出的“关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示”中，已号召全国人民，认真做好拥军优属工作，尽一切可能切实帮助你们克服医疗上、休养上以及生活上、工作上的困难。望你们安心休养，努力工作，并祝你们春节身体健康！
