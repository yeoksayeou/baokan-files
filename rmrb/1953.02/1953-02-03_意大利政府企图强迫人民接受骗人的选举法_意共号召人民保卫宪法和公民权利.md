Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 2nd: TASS, Rome, February 2nd: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued the following statement:

    The leadership of the Communist Party held a meeting on January 29th and 30th. The leadership discussed the political situation arising from the government's blatant violation of constitutional principles and parliamentary powers, and its stubborn attempt to force Italian citizens to accept a fraudulent election law; and discussed the reactionary attempt to trample on the rights of the working people and openly launch an attack on the working class.
    The leadership of the Communist Party pointed out that the encroachment on freedom by the clerical government has met with a powerful tide of anger from the people across the country. Workers, farmers, office workers, small producers and merchants have united to express their protests through various legal means - strikes, petitions and demonstrations, etc.
    Working people and citizens of other social strata, including railway workers, pensioners and the disabled, have taken resolute action in recent weeks to demand that the government meet their legitimate demands. The widespread discussions about this fraudulent law in industrial enterprises, cities and villages, the mass movement to defend democratic freedom, and the anger of men and women citizens holding various political views have frustrated the government's attempt to conceal the immoral and unjust truth of this new law. These actions show that the Christian Democrats and their accomplices encountered resistance from the masses of the people in the first stage of the struggle, and they will certainly encounter this resistance again in the elections.
    The leadership of the Communist Party pays tribute to all citizens who have participated in the broad patriotic movement to defend the constitution, civil rights and equal voting rights, and expresses its solidarity with the working people who have been oppressed by their employers for participating in mass protests against the fraudulent election law. The leadership of the Communist Party instructs all party members who are actively working in various organizations to stand at the forefront of this united movement, as they have done so far, to destroy the government's provocations, expose their attacks on the right to strike, fight for better living conditions for the working people, and resolutely support the struggle of the democratic upper house parliamentarians against the fraudulent election law.
    In view of the fact that the Christian Democrats have made it impossible for the parliament to take a free decision on the election law, the leadership of the Communist Party calls on the people of Italy to support Comrade Togliatti's proposal to hold a public referendum on this bill. The leadership of the Communist Party calls on all organizations across the country to prepare for the People's Representative Conference proposed by the opposition parliamentarians, with the participation of the broadest strata of society, and to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the people's petition to be submitted to the upper house of the Republic.
    The leadership of the Communist Party calls on all honest Italians to support the activities of the opposition parliamentarians in defending the Constitution, defending the parliament and the equal rights of citizens.
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome: According to TASS, under the persecution of government authorities and capitalists, the movement of the Italian people against the government's electoral system "reform" conspiracy continues to develop nationwide.
    On January 31st, the Italian people held mass rallies, strikes and demonstrations in many towns and cities to oppose the government's electoral system "reform" bill. In Reggio Emilia, several thousand workers, farmers and students organized a massive demonstration. The people of Montese in the province of Modena, the dockworkers of Venice, all the industrial workers of Messina, and the people of Sesa, Galanzanas, Tempio-Pausania, Gaspini and many other towns in Sardinia held numerous protest strikes and demonstrations.
    The Italian authorities have adopted repressive measures to persecute the people who oppose the government's fascist conspiracy. The authorities of Terni Province sentenced merchants who closed their shops in support of the striking workers to fines. The authorities of Grande Province ordered the punishment of the staff of the municipal committee who participated in the strike movement. The authorities of Cosenza Province dismissed the mayor of Speciano because he refused to wipe out the slogans against the electoral system "reform" bill on the walls and sidewalks. However, the Italian people continue to persist in their struggle. The people of Macarinoa in the province of Caltanissetta held a demonstration to protest the dismissal of the Communist mayor who supported the people's protest movement by the provincial authorities.

    意大利政府企图强迫人民接受骗人的选举法
    意共号召人民保卫宪法和公民权利
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社罗马二日讯：意大利共产党领导机构发表声明如下：
    共产党领导机构在一月二十九、三十两日举行了会议。领导机构讨论了由于政府悍然违反宪法原则和议会权力、顽固地企图强使意大利公民接受骗人的选举法所引起的政治形势；并讨论了反动派蹂躏劳动人民的权利并对工人阶级公开发动进攻的企图。
    共产党领导机构指出：教会派的政府侵犯自由的行为，遇到全国人民强大的怒潮。工人、农民、职员、小生产者和商人都已团结起来，通过各种合法的方式——罢工、请愿和示威游行等等，表示他们的抗议。
    劳动人民和其他阶层的公民，其中包括铁路工人、依养老金为生的人以及残废的人，最近几个星期来采取了坚决的行动，要求政府答应他们的正当要求。在产业企业、城市和乡村里普遍展开的关于这个骗人的法律的讨论、保卫民主自由的群众运动、抱着各种不同政见的男女公民的愤怒，已挫败了政府不暴露这个新法律的不道德和不公正的真相的企图。这些行动表明了：天主教民主党人和他们的同谋者，在斗争的第一个阶段中就遭到了人民群众的抵抗，他们以后在选举中间一定还要遭到这种抵抗。
    共产党的领导机构向参加了保卫宪法、民权以及平等的选举权的广泛爱国运动的全体公民致敬，并表示它和那些因参加反对骗人的选举法的群众抗议运动而受到雇主压迫的劳动人民站在一起。共产党的领导机构责成在各种组织中积极工作的全体党员，像迄今所做的那样，站在这个联合的运动的最前列，以摧毁政府的挑衅，揭露他们对罢工权利的进攻，为劳动人民争取较好的生活条件，并坚决支持民主的上院议员反对骗人的选举法的斗争。
    鉴于天主教民主党使议会没有可能就选举法采取自由的决定，共产党的领导机构号召意大利全国人民支持陶里亚蒂同志提出的就这个法案举行公民表决的建议。共产党的领导机构号召全国一切团体在最广泛阶层的参加下，筹备反对派议员建议召开的人民代表会议，并保证最广泛地传播准备向共和国的上院提出的人民请愿书。
    共产党的领导机构号召所有正直的意大利人支持反对派议员保卫宪法、保卫议会和公民平等权利的活动。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：在政府当局和资本家的迫害下，意大利人民反对政府选举制“改革”阴谋的运动仍然继续在全国范围内发展。
    一月三十一日，意大利人民在许多城镇里举行了群众大会、罢工和示威游行，反对政府的选举制“改革”法案。在艾米利亚的勒佐，好几千工人、农民和学生组织了一次声势浩大的示威游行。摩登纳省的蒙特萨的人民、威尼斯的码头工人、墨西拿的全部产业工人、撒丁岛的塞沙、加兰赞纳斯、潭彼奥—波山尼亚、加斯彼尼及其他许多城镇的人民都举行了许多次抗议罢工和示威游行。
    意大利当局采取高压手段来迫害反对政府法西斯阴谋的人民。特尔尼省当局把关上店门声援罢工工人的商人判处了罚金。大兰多省当局下令惩办参加罢工运动的市政委员会的职员们。科森萨省当局把斯培西亚诺市市长免职，因为他拒绝拭去墙壁和行人道上的反对选举制“改革”法案的标语。但是，意大利人民继续坚持斗争。卡尔坦尼塞塔省马查里诺地方的人民举行了示威游行，抗议省政当局把支持人民抗议运动的共产党市长撤职。
