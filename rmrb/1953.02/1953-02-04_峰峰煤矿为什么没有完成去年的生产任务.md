Editorial Note: In many coal mines in North China, East China, and other regions, there still exists a phenomenon where the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Youth League organizations do not cooperate with each other and go their own way, which seriously affects the completion of the national production plan. The chaos that occurred in the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine last year is a more prominent example. Although the chaotic situation in the Fengfeng Coal Mine has recently undergone some changes, its lessons are worthy of attention by all coal mines.

In the first three quarters of 1952, the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine failed to complete the production tasks stipulated by the state. In particular, only 64.43 percent of the tunneling work was completed in the first half of the year; although there was a slight increase in the third quarter, a major roof collapse accident occurred in the main roadway, which had not happened in several years. The financial overspending situation was also very serious. In the first half of the year, the overspending on wages alone exceeded 3.3 billion yuan.

There are many problems from the perspective of production management as to why the Fengfeng Coal Mine cannot complete the national production tasks: First, in the first half of the year, the main cadres concentrated their efforts on "fighting tigers" in the "Three-Anti" movement, rarely went down the well, did not understand production, the supply of materials was greatly affected, workers' labor discipline was lax, and grass-roots cadres did not dare to take responsibility, resulting in a reduction in production efficiency. Second, after the mine changed from the old handicraft coal mining method to the new mechanized coal mining method, the leadership did not change the leadership in time to keep up with the requirements of production reform. There are many levels of production command (the mine was originally divided into six levels: branch mine manager, coal mining section chief, district director, team leader, and team, but it has now been changed to a three-level system), and problems are solved slowly. At the same time, the new coal mining method and transportation development are unbalanced in production, and the coordination between mechanized mining and manual pushing is not coordinated, either the cars are waiting for coal, or the coal is waiting for cars. The number of mechanical and electrical equipment has increased, but the management technology is low, and accidents often occur. Secondly, there is a lack of planning in production management, with more extraction and less tunneling, and no working faces are prepared, which affects production.

The chaotic phenomenon in the production management of the Fengfeng Coal Mine has not been resolved for a long time due to the many errors and shortcomings of the Fengfeng local Party committee, local trade union, and coal mine administration, and they do not cooperate with each other and go their own way.

The most important mistake in the leadership of the Fengfeng Mining Area Local Party Committee is that they did not consider the characteristics of industrial and mining enterprises and did not grasp the "production first" policy. They did not concentrate the strength of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Youth League on production. As a result, everyone did their own thing, each with its own center, forming a chaotic situation of "thousands of things to do, no one responsible." In the third quarter of 1952, the Fengfeng Coal Mine, like other factories and mines across the country, launched a vigorous production competition movement. At the same time, it was stipulated that the original production quota should be increased by 36.7 percent, and the original mechanized coal mining, which was less than 30 percent, should be increased to about 70 percent. In the face of this major task, it is very necessary for the comrades of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League to work together. Comrade Duan Yi, secretary of the mining area Party committee, also said: Production is the overriding center, and the promotion of advanced experience is the central link. The quality of the work of all departments should be marked by the quality of production. However, in reality, the mining area Party committee did not implement this. Almost at the same time as this speech, the Party committee decided to launch a campaign to eliminate illiteracy, and it must be "vigorous, large-scale, and create a mass movement." In the organization and leadership of the literacy campaign, each mine manager, general branch secretary, and trade union chairman must serve as the director or principal of the literacy campaign committee. At the mobilization meeting for the literacy campaign, Comrade Fu Shixia, a member of the Party committee, asked each mine to prepare houses as classrooms. He said: "If you can give houses, give houses; if you can't give houses, build sheds. Otherwise, drag the mine manager out and expose him to the sun for two hours." The reason is: "He doesn't care about the cultural emancipation of the working class." According to Comrade Wang Picheng, secretary of the coal mine Party committee (also a member of the standing committee of the local Party committee): Once the literacy campaign came, it was really overwhelming and overshadowed everything. Hundreds of workers left production to attend literacy training classes. The workers who remained in the mine had no time to discuss production plans, no time for Party members and Youth League members and trade union activities, and all their spare time was taken up by literacy campaigns. It was originally said that cadres above the working face would not participate in literacy training classes for the time being, so as not to hinder production. As a result, the deputy mine managers of the First and Fourth Mines left, the nationally famous pneumatic drill operator Luo Rongjin left, and the director of the repair shop and the directors of the six workshops all left, and even the ventilation section chief in charge of safety work left. At this time, a major roof collapse accident occurred in the First Mine, which had not happened in several years, killing and injuring four workers. Under this bloody lesson, the Party committee approved the request of security cadres to return to work in the mine.

While the literacy campaign was still continuing, the Party committee issued another order: to transfer worker Party members to undergo training for Party consolidation and Party building. The coal mine Party committee was afraid of affecting production and requested to conduct training in three batches. However, the local Party committee did not approve, saying that this was an instruction from the provincial Party committee and a central task, and it must be completed in two phases.

The Fengfeng Local Party Committee (including the local trade union) also has errors in its leadership methods over the Fengfeng Mining Bureau (including the coal mine Party committee and the coal mine trade union). The Fengfeng Mining Area Local Party Committee took over the work of the coal mine Party committee and also replaced the administrative leadership of the Mining Bureau in some areas. The Party and government cadres of the Mining Bureau unanimously reflected that they "cannot stretch out" and "have nothing to do." They said: The work plan of the local Party committee is very specific, and even how to divide the work on the working face and how to lead it is written on paper. We will do whatever it says. Under such circumstances, it is difficult for the Party committee of the Fengfeng Coal Mine to intervene in the work. From July to November, the coal mine Party committee did not hold a single independent meeting. Because "the local Party committee did everything." The local Party committee held meetings and issued notices, skipping the Party committee and administrative organization of the Mining Bureau and going directly to the grass-roots mines.

The local trade union work in the Fengfeng Mining Area also has serious errors. They were making a fuss about the so-called "trade union position" and opposing the coal mine Party committee and enterprise administration, and moved the set of methods of rural land reform to state-owned enterprises, opening and closing their mouths with "struggle," which further aggravated the chaos in the Fengfeng Coal Mine. The day after Comrade Duan Yi said that "production is the overriding center," the local trade union gathered the trade union chairmen of various grass-roots mines to "check their positions" and arranged to "struggle" against administrative leaders. According to comrades from the North China Working Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, the meetings held by the local trade union in the third quarter of 1952 rarely mentioned production, and each time they talked about "how to struggle," "resolutely struggle," and "support and be the master." When Comrade Fu Shixia, chairman of the trade union (also a member of the Party committee), spoke at the conference, he also used "bah! bah! bah!" to spit and insult the personality of administrative leaders. This local trade union chairman once clearly stated to others: "In the past, the coal mine trade union was not under our control, and the local trade union had no prestige among the workers. In order to establish the prestige of the local trade union, we must show the workers a few tricks!" Under the control of this erroneous thinking, they acted recklessly. A worker in the First Mine violated discipline. After joint discussion and research by the administration and the grass-roots trade union, he was expelled. After the local trade union learned about it, it immediately called the chairman of the grass-roots trade union and asked the chairman of the grass-roots trade union to "struggle" against the administration. The chairman of the grass-roots trade union disagreed, and the chairman of the local trade union said: "If you dare not struggle, then don't go back to the mine." Under the instigation and support of the local trade union, the expelled worker pointed at the noses of the management personnel and said: "You are simply acting like a special agent." This incident left a very bad impression among the workers and the vast number of grass-roots cadres. The upright workers couldn't stand it, and the lazy people raised their heads. For example, a worker in the Second Mine was sleeping during production, and the management personnel took away his operating lamp and prepared to report it to the trade union. The worker glared his eyes: "You report it! I'll report you to the trade union!" The matter ended like this. On October 16, the local trade union passed another "new regulation." That is: big workers do small jobs, and the original wages are paid; small workers do big jobs, and they are paid according to their work. According to the investigation of the technical personnel of the Coal Mine General Bureau, the result of the implementation of this method is that among the 23 fifth-level workers on the 206 working face, 18 of them are doing the work of third-level or fourth-level workers. This is actually encouraging backwardness and rewarding laziness.

The local Party committee neither stopped nor openly criticized this extremely wrong practice of the local trade union, but let it go, resulting in widespread anxiety among all Party, administrative, and trade union cadres in the coal mine system. They said: The chairman of the trade union is one of the members of the Party committee. How dare he "struggle" without discussing it with the Party committee? This must be the "intention of the Party committee." Under such circumstances, the demand to transfer jobs became a common trend. A member of the standing committee of the Party committee said: At least about 80 percent of the cadres want to leave Fengfeng. Due to the erroneous leadership of the local Party committee and the local trade union, and due to the uneasy mood of the cadres, production lost its leadership and there was no core. Almost all the activists, labor models, and Communist Party members of the Fengfeng Coal Mine were transferred to eliminate illiteracy, consolidate the Party, and receive training. As the workers said, at that time: "We only hear someone shouting, but no one is in charge of production." As a result, the production tasks were not completed for three consecutive months, and the new quotas were not reached, resulting in a general decline in wages, and 80 percent of the workers could not even earn their standard wages. The trade union was clamoring every day to "safeguard the interests of the workers" and "adhere to the trade union position," but it was completely unaware of this situation. It was not until the end of September that several members of the Party committee went to the Fourth Mine to investigate materials and "happened" to hear the workers scolding everywhere that they realized that "wages are a big problem."

There are also serious shortcomings and errors in the administrative leadership of the Fengfeng Coal Mine. The leading comrades of the Mining Bureau have been immersed in numbers for a long time, rarely look at the actual lives of the workers, and rarely consider the opinions from below. Therefore, many problems that should be solved have not been solved in a timely and appropriate manner. The production reform of the Fengfeng Coal Mine has not been done well, and the barbaric manual basket-pulling method of work still remains. In the third quarter of 1952, they calculated that there would be a surplus of 1,900 workers in the second half of the year based on the figures of increased mechanized coal mining and increased production quotas, and believed that these people would affect the efficiency of all employees if they stayed in the mine. In order to "improve" efficiency, they mistakenly formulated a plan to lay off 1,900 employees (this plan was once approved by the local Party committee and agreed to by the trade union). This plan caused great fluctuations among the workers and affected the production in the third quarter. In fact, there are not too many workers in the Fengfeng Mine, but too few workers, and they are not enough, so in the end, not only were no employees laid off, but more than 2,000 workers were added. This shows that the bureaucratic style of the administrative leaders has reached its peak. Other things like the workers' dormitories in the capital construction office and the working conditions of the lime kiln workers should be improved, but they have not been improved. In terms of wage rewards, after revising the quota, the leadership did not think of ways to strive to reach the quota, and has long used the "estimated wage" method to take care of the workers' income. The proportion of "estimated wages" in each mine is very large, accounting for 60 percent in the Second Mine, and some even changed piece-rate wages to daily wages, which reduced work efficiency. The workers reflected: "Good or bad is not distinguished, and the leaders only pursue production with their eyes open and their eyes closed." The bonuses of about 500 million yuan from the previous year were not distributed until August last year, which affected the significance of the rewards.

In addition to the above reasons, the chaotic phenomenon in the Fengfeng Coal Mine is also related to the experience and style of some cadres. Fengfeng is a large-scale industrial and mining area, but the original Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee (i.e., the local Party committee mentioned above) was only an organization equivalent to a county-level organization, under the leadership of the Handan Prefectural Committee. There were few cadres and they were relatively weak. In June 1952, the local Party committee was expanded into a prefectural-level organization, directly under the jurisdiction of the Hebei Provincial Committee. The current secretary of the Party committee, minister of the organization department, minister of the propaganda department, chairman of the government, chairman of the trade union, and secretary of the coal mine Party committee (all of whom are members of the mining area Party committee) are all new here. They brought 100 to 200 cadres with them and also brought the determination to do a good job in the Fengfeng Mining Area, which was necessary to strengthen the work of Fengfeng. However, these comrades all came from rural areas or small and medium-sized towns, had no experience in leading enterprises, and were not familiar with the Party's specific policies in industry. In addition, some of these comrades were arrogant and complacent and did not humbly learn. They thought that they had participated in the study of opposing rural views and rural work styles in 1948 and said that there were no problems in their thinking; others thought that although they had not led large enterprises, they had also led workshops that made baskets and cast iron pots, and believed that the problems of large enterprises were only slightly different from the problems they had encountered in their previous work. They relied on these "capital" to criticize everywhere. Especially the chairman of the trade union, from the day he got off the train, he has been criticizing, almost every meeting he is criticizing. Looking at it now, many criticisms are unreasonable. For example, the quota problem. At the beginning of raising the quota in July, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and the workers automatically increased the quota by 59 percent. The administrative personnel considered various conditions and believed that it could not be achieved, and gradually reduced it to 36.7 percent. At this time, some newly arrived comrades criticized the administrative personnel for being ideologically conservative and always lagging behind the masses. But when even this quota, which was only increased by 36.7 percent, could not be reached, they criticized the administration for always liking to set high quotas. In order to prove that the quota was high, they also organized people to conduct "investigations." They took the results of the "investigations" to the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Coal Mine Management General Bureau to submit them. They requested to reduce the quota by 10 to 15 percent. The Hebei Provincial Committee agreed to their request, and the Coal Mine Management General Bureau rejected their opinion, believing that the quota should not be changed in principle, and individual high quotas could be adjusted. At the same time, they instructed them to organize manpower well to realize the plan. After "organizing and realizing" it in October, many types of work exceeded the new quota by 50 percent, and individual types of work exceeded 150 percent.

In order to thoroughly correct the chaotic phenomenon in the Fengfeng Coal Mine, the North China Administrative Committee, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Coal Mine Management General Bureau, and the North China Working Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union organized a "Fengfeng Coal Mine Work Inspection Team" in November last year to conduct an inspection, pointed out some errors in the Fengfeng Mine, and put forward suggestions for improving future work. The production situation began to improve in November. The coal output has increased from an average daily output of 5,264 tons in September to an average daily output of 6,062 tons in early November, and the "golden age of the Fengfeng Coal Mine in one year" has appeared. However, the relationship between the Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee, the local trade union, and the Mining Bureau has not been completely improved. The Hebei Provincial Committee, the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Coal Mine Management General Bureau need to further resolve it.

    峰峰煤矿为什么没有完成去年的生产任务
    林里
    编者按：在华北、华东及其他地区的许多煤矿中，直到现在还存在着一种党委、行政、工会、青年团等组织互不配合、各行其是的现象，严重地影响了国家生产计划的完成。国营峰峰煤矿在去年发生的混乱情况，是其中一个比较突出的例子。峰峰煤矿的混乱情况最近虽然已有若干改变，但它的教训是值得所有煤矿注意的。
    国营峰峰煤矿在一九五二年的前三个季度都没有完成国家所规定的生产任务。特别是掘进工作前半年只完成了任务的百分之六十四点四三；第三季度虽稍有提高，但发生了几年来所没有的大巷冒顶的重大事故。财政超支情况也很严重。上半年只工资一项即超支三十三亿元以上。
    峰峰煤矿不能完成国家生产任务，从生产管理方面看，是有很多问题的：一、上半年“三反”运动中主要干部集中精力“打虎”，长期不下井，不了解生产，材料供应受到很大影响，工人劳动纪律松懈，基层干部不敢负责，生产效率降低。二、该矿由旧的手工业采煤法改变为新式的机械化的采煤法后，领导上没有及时改变领导，赶不上生产改革的要求。生产指挥层次多（该矿原分矿长、采煤科长、区主任、领班区队长、小组六级，现已改为三级制），解决问题迟缓。同时生产上新采煤法与搬运发展不平衡，机（器）采手推不协调，不是车等煤，就是煤等车。机电设备增多，而管理技术低，常发生事故。其次在生产管理上缺乏计划性，回采多，掘进少，准备不出工作面，影响生产。
    峰峰煤矿生产管理中的混乱现象长期不能解决，是由于峰峰地方党委、地方工会和煤矿行政上都存在着很多错误和缺点，并且互不配合，各行其是。
    峰峰矿区地方党委领导上的最主要的错误，是它们没有考虑工矿企业的特点，没有抓紧“生产第一”的方针。没有把党委、行政、工会和青年团的力量集中到生产上。以致各搞一套，各有各的中心，形成所谓“千头万绪，无人负责”的混乱局面。一九五二年第三季度，峰峰煤矿和全国其他厂矿一样，展开了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛运动。同时规定要把原来的生产定额提高了百分之三十六点七，把原来不足百分之三十的机械化采煤提高到百分之七十左右。在这重大任务的前面，很需要党、政、工、团的同志们齐心努力，矿区党委书记段毅同志也说：生产是压倒一切的中心，推广先进经验是中心环节，各部门的工作好坏，要以生产的好坏为标志。但实际上矿区党委并没有这样执行。几乎在这个讲话的同时，党委会决定开展扫除文盲运动，并且要“轰轰烈烈、大张旗鼓、造成群众性的运动”。在扫除文盲运动的组织领导上一定要各矿长、总支书记、工会主席担任扫除文盲委员会的正副主任或校长。在动员扫除文盲大会上，党委委员傅石侠同志要各矿准备房子做教室。他说：“能给房子的给房子，不能给房子的搭席棚。否则就把矿长拉到太阳底下晒两点钟。”理由是：“他不关心工人阶级文化翻身。”据煤矿党委书记（也是地方党委常委）王丕成同志谈：扫除文盲运动一来，真是排山倒海，压倒一切。数百名工人离开生产，到扫除文盲训练班受训了。留在矿上的工人，没有讨论生产计划的时间，没有党团员和工会的活动时间，一切业余时间都被扫除文盲占去了。原说掌子面以上干部暂不参加扫除文盲训练班学习，以免妨害生产。结果一、四矿的副矿长走了，全国出名的风镐手罗荣金走了，修理厂的厂长和六个车间主任全走了，甚而负责安全工作的通风股长也走了。就在这时，一矿发生了几年来所没有的大巷冒顶的重大事故，砸死砸伤了四名工人。在这血的教训下，党委会才批准了保安干部回矿工作的要求。
    扫除文盲工作还在继续，党委会又发下另一道命令：抽调工人党员去做整党建党的训练。煤矿党委怕影响生产，要求分三批整训。但地方党委不批准，说这是省委指示，是中心任务，一定两期整完。
    峰峰地方党委（包括地方工会）对峰峰矿务局
    （包括煤矿党委、煤矿工会）的领导方法，也是错误的。峰峰矿区地方党委包办了煤矿党委的工作，也在某些地方代替了矿务局的行政领导。矿务局的党、政干部一致反映：“伸展不开”，“无事可做”，他们说：地方党委的工作计划很具体，连掌子面如何分工，如何领导都写在纸上了，它怎么说我们就怎么做吧。在这种情况下，峰峰煤矿的党委会也很难插手工作。从七月到十一月，煤矿党委连一次独立的会议也没有召开过。因为“所有事情地方党委都做了”。地方党委开会、下通知，都跳过矿务局的党委和行政组织，一直“深入”到基层矿。
    峰峰矿区的地方工会工作，也有严重的错误。他们闹着所谓“工会立场”，和煤矿党委、企业行政对立，并把农村土地改革的一套办法，搬到国营企业中来，开口闭口就是“斗争”，这就更加重了峰峰煤矿的混乱。就在段毅同志说过“生产是压倒一切的中心”的第二天，地方工会集合了各个基层矿的工会主席“检查立场”，布置向行政领导者的
    “斗争”。据煤矿工会华北工作委员会的同志反映：一九五二年第三季度，地方工会所召开的会议，很少提到生产，每次都讲“如何斗争”，“坚决斗争”，以及“撑腰做主”等。工会主席傅石侠
    （也是党委委员）在大会上发言时，还用“呸！呸！呸！”地唾骂侮辱行政领导者的人格。这位地方工会主席曾经对人明白表示过：“过去，煤矿工会不属咱管，地方工会在工人中没有威信。为了树立地方工会的威信，就必须露两手给工人看看！”在这种错误的思想支配下，他们就胡作非为起来。一矿一个工人违犯了纪律。经行政和基层工会共同讨论研究，开除了。地方工会知道后，立刻把基层工会主席找来，要基层工会主席向行政上“斗争”。基层工会主席不同意，地方工会主席就说：“你不敢斗争，那就干脆别回矿了。”在地方工会的怂恿和支持下，那个被开除的工人竟指着管理人员的鼻子说：“你简直是特务行为。”这件事，在工人以及广大基层干部中，留下极坏的印象，正派的工人看不惯，偷懒的人们抬头了。又如二矿一个工人在生产时睡觉，管理人员拿走他的操作灯，准备向工会报告。这个工人把眼一瞪：“你报告！我还向工会报告你哩！”事情就这样完结了。十月十六日，地方工会又通行了另一“新章程”。即：大工做小活，原工资照发；小工做大活，按劳取酬。据煤矿总局的技术人员调查；这个办法执行的结果是：二○六号掌子面二十三个五级工中，就有十八个人是做着三级或四级工人的活。这实际上是鼓励落后，奖励偷懒。
    地方工会这种极端错误的作法，当地党委既不出来制止，又不公开批评，听之任之，结果造成煤矿系统的所有党、行政和工会干部的普遍不安。他们说：工会主席是党委委员之一，“斗争”要不经过党委讨论，他怎么敢呢？这一定是“党委意图”。在这种情况下，要求调动工作成了普遍的风潮。党委会的一位常委说：要求离开峰峰的干部至少在百分之八十左右。由于地方党委、地方工会的错误领导，由于干部的不安情绪，就使生产失去了领导，又没有了核心。峰峰煤矿所有的积极分子、劳动模范、共产党员，几乎全部抽去扫除文盲、整党和受训去了。照工人的话说，当时是：“只听有人喊，生产没人管”。因而一连三个月完不成生产任务，更达不到新的定额，以致工资普遍下降，有百分之八十的工人连标准工资也挣不够。工会天天在吵着“维护工人利益”，“坚持工会立场”，但对这一情况却毫无所闻。直到九月底，几个党委委员去四矿调查材料，
    “碰上”工人到处乱骂，这才发现“工资是个大问题”。
    峰峰煤矿的行政领导上，也存在着严重的缺点和错误。矿务局的领导同志，长期钻到数目字里，很少看看工人的实际生活，很少考虑来自下面的意见。因此许多应该解决的问题没有及时地、恰当地解决。峰峰煤矿的生产改革做得很不好，至今还残存着野蛮的人工拉筐式的工作法。一九五二年第三季度，他们根据机械化采煤加大，生产定额提高的数字，计算出下半年有一千九百名工人的富余，并认为这些人留在矿上会影响全员效率。为了“提高”效率，就错误地拟定了裁减一千九百名员工的计划（这个计划曾经地方党委的批准和工会的同意）。这项计划在工人中引起了很大波动，影响了第三季度的生产。事实上峰峰矿上不是工人多，而是工人少，不够用，所以最后不但没有裁员，反增加了二千多名工人。这说明行政领导者的官僚主义已达到登峰造极的地步。其他像基本建设处的工人宿舍，灰窑工人的劳动条件，都应该改善，但没有改善。在工资奖励上，修改定额后，领导上没有想办法争取达到定额，而且长期的用“估计工资”方法去照顾工人收入。各矿的“估计工资”比重很大，二矿竟占百分之六十，有的竟把计件工资改为按日计资，使工作效率降低。工人反映：“好坏不分，领导上睁眼合眼只是追生产。”前年的奖金约五亿元，直到去年八月才发下，影响了奖励的意义。
    峰峰煤矿的混乱现象，除了以上原因而外，还和一些干部的经验与作风有关。峰峰是个颇具规模的工矿区，但原来的峰峰矿区党委会（即前面所称地方党委）只是个相当于县一级的组织，属邯郸地委领导。干部少，也比较弱。一九五二年六月，地方党委扩充为地委级组织，直属河北省委管辖。现在的党委书记，组织部长，宣传部长，政府主席，工会主席，煤矿党委书记（均系矿区党委委员）统是新来的。他们带来了一、二百名干部，也带来了做好峰峰矿区工作的决心，这本是加强峰峰工作所必要的。但这些同志全是来自农村或中小城镇，没有领导企业的经验，不熟悉党在工业方面的具体政策，加之这些同志中间又有些人骄傲自满，不虚心学习。他们自以为参加过一九四八年的反对农村观点与农村作风的学习，就说思想上没有问题；还有人以为自己虽然没有领导过大企业，可也领导过编篮子、铸铁锅的作坊工作，认为大企业的问题和他们以前的工作中所碰到的问题只不过是大同小异。他们就仗凭着这些“资本”，到处批评。特别是工会主席，从他下火车的那天起，一直批评，几乎每次会议上都在批评。现在来看，许多批评是毫无道理的。譬如定额问题。七月份提高定额之初，群众情绪很高，工人们自动提高定额达百分之五十九。行政人员考虑了各方面的条件，认为达不到，逐级降为百分之三十六点七。这时，某些新来的同志批评说：行政人员思想保守，总是掉在群众的后头。但当连这仅只提高了百分之三十六点七的定额也达不到的时候，他们又批评行政上总喜欢制订高额定额。为了证明定额高，还组织人们进行了“查定”。拿着“查定”结果，去河北省委和煤矿管理总局呈请。要求降低定额百分之十到百分之十五。河北省委同意了他们的请求，煤矿管理总局批驳了他们的意见，认为定额原则上不应变动，个别高了的可以调整，同时指示他们要很好组织人力，实现计划。十月份加以“组织实现”之后，不少工种超过了新定额的百分之五十，个别超过百分之一百五十多。
    为了彻底纠正峰峰煤矿的混乱现象，华北行政委员会、中共河北省委会、煤矿管理总局和煤矿工会华北工作委员会，于去年十一月内组织了“峰峰煤矿工作检查组”前往检查，指出峰峰矿的若干错误，提出了改进今后工作的意见。十一月份生产情况开始好转，产煤量已由九月份平均日产五二六四吨，上升为十一月上旬的平均日产六○六二吨，出现了
    “峰峰煤矿一年中的黄金时代”。但是峰峰矿区党委、地方工会和矿务局的关系仍然没有彻底改善。还需要河北省委、河北省总工会、煤矿管理总局进一步予以解决。
