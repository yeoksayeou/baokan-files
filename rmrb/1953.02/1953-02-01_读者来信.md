Reader's Letters

    Firmly Oppose Erroneous Actions That Waste State Assets

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received some reader's letters exposing the serious situation of the Henan Province Huai River General Headquarters and other units not valuing the work of material storage, resulting in serious waste of state assets. It should be pointed out: A grain of millet or a bag of cement is the wealth of the country, and we should use these materials rationally in the construction of the motherland to give full play to their role; any waste of materials is an erroneous action that directly or indirectly undermines the accumulation of funds for the motherland. At present, the large-scale economic construction of the motherland has begun, and the issue of saving materials and opposing waste should be given special attention in the future. We hope that the people who love the motherland will pay attention to this issue, relentlessly expose the phenomenon of wasting state assets that already exists in various places, and actively put forward various methods and opinions that are conducive to saving. Now we are selecting four reader's letters to be published below:

    Henan Province Huai River General Headquarters Accumulates Cement, Causing Serious Waste

    Editor: The Henan Province Huai River General Headquarters blindly expanded budget figures, accumulated a large amount of cement, and caused serious damage to state property.

    According to inspection, the department has more than 3,000 tons of cement in storage, some of which have been stored for more than a year; in addition, due to poor storage, much of the cement has deteriorated or hardened into blocks. Among them, more than 1,000 tons of cement stored in the Xinyang warehouse have all deteriorated; one-tenth of it has hardened into blocks and cannot be used at all. It is estimated that the loss caused by the accumulation of cement in the department is about 1 billion yuan.

    It is recommended that the Henan Province Huai River General Headquarters immediately take effective measures to deal with this batch of cement, so as to avoid greater losses to state property.

    Tangyin County Cooperative's Irresponsible Work Causes Large Amounts of Cottonseed Stored at Cotton Stations to Heat Up and Become Moldy

    Editor: I want to expose a distressing matter to you: The Tangyin County Cooperative in Henan Province is irresponsible in its cottonseed storage work, resulting in a large amount of cottonseed heating up and becoming moldy, causing damage to state property, and making it impossible for local people to carry out sideline production of oil processing.

    Last November, Comrade Li Rongqin from the Anyang Office of our China Oils and Fats Company went to Tangyin County to inspect the cooperative's organization of oil mill processing work and found that a large amount of cottonseed stored at the cooperative's cotton stations in the county was heating up and becoming moldy. For example, the cottonseed stored at the six cotton stations in Longhua Village, Caiyuanji, Huangfu Village, Wazigang Village, Fudao Town, and Wenshide Village has already had 390,000 jin heating up or becoming moldy, which, when converted into Renminbi, results in a loss of about 170 million yuan to state property. The reason for this situation is that the cotton stations are irresponsible in their cottonseed storage work. Local people have many opinions about this situation, with some saying, "The cooperative doesn't cherish state property at all. They store so much cottonseed without covering it with mats, letting it be exposed to the wind and rain. The money that the spoiled cottonseed is worth now wouldn't even be enough to build a large shed." And what is even more intolerable is that the county cooperative didn't even know about this situation until Li Rongqin reported it to them last November, and only then did they send cadres to the cotton stations to inspect.

    The county cooperative is entrusted by the Oils and Fats Company to organize the masses to process oil. However, because the cottonseed stored at the cooperative's cotton stations is moldy, the oil yield is low, and the oil quality is poor, many people are unwilling to sign cottonseed processing contracts with the cooperative; and those who have signed contracts are unwilling to go to the cotton stations to collect cottonseed. Cadres at the Caiyuanji cotton station even forbade the masses to pick and choose when they came to collect cottonseed, saying, "If you get the bad ones, then take the bad ones." This has aroused even greater dissatisfaction among the masses. Some people said, "The People's Government calls on us to engage in sideline production. How can we do it like this?"

    The occurrence of this phenomenon of harming national interests is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the Anyang Special Zone Cooperative. The Anyang region produces more than 100 million jin of cottonseed every year, which can produce more than 10 million jin of oil. However, last year, the special zone cooperative only signed processing contracts with the Oils and Fats Company for 2.2 million jin of cottonseed; their reason is that the oil mills cannot process it. But they either don't know or know but don't urge a solution to the serious situation of cottonseed spoilage and the unwillingness of the masses to sign processing contracts with the Tangyin County Cooperative.

    I believe that the Anyang Special Zone Cooperative should investigate the issue of cottonseed spoilage in the Tangyin County Cooperative and correct this bureaucratic leadership style.  Wei Huailin

    Suggestion to Inspect and Deal with the Molderd Wheat and Actions to Cover up Mistakes in Wucheng County Grain Bureau

    Editor: The Wucheng County Grain Bureau is indifferent to state assets, resulting in large batches of wheat in storage becoming moldy. Since the wheat was put into storage in July 1952, the bureau has never ventilated or aired it until it conducted an inspection in mid-December 1952. At this time, the grain piles were already giving off heat, the mats close to the grain had grown green mold, and the wheat on top had hardened into cakes and rotted. A total of more than 2.2 million jin of wheat in the county's warehouses and open-air scattered piles, including more than 6,800 jin that had become moldy and deteriorated, and 165,000 jin that had been eaten by insects; after screening, 2,946 jin of insect-eaten ash alone was screened out. What is particularly serious is that after discovering this situation, the leaders of the bureau did not actively try to improve it, but instead mixed insect-eaten grain with good wheat in order to cover up their mistakes. This not only affected the quality of the good grain, but also increased the difficulty of storage.

    Before the inspection, comrades in the bureau had already discovered that the wheat was infested with insects and suggested that it be ventilated and screened. However, the leaders of the bureau not only did not adopt this suggestion, but instead reprimanded the person who made the suggestion, saying, "You are making a fuss, the grain is not bad yet, what will we do if we lose weight by screening it!" I suggest that the local government give severe punishment to those who are indifferent to the property of the motherland.

    Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce Should Immediately Seriously Handle the Incident of Excessive Oil Consumption at the Dingxian Oils and Fats Branch Company

    Editor: The Dingxian Branch of the China Oils and Fats Company suffered an event last year where more than 5,000 jin of stored peanut oil was excessively consumed, causing serious damage to state property, but the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce has not yet dealt with it seriously.

    One of the reasons for the large consumption of oil stored at the branch company is that the leading cadres of the branch company were irresponsible in their oil storage management, so that cracks in the oil pool were not discovered in time. It was not until early July last year that an old lady living next to the branch company saw some children digging pits outside the wall of the branch company to take the oil that was seeping out of the soil; and some people used small spoons to scrape oil from the wall of the branch company and take it home to light lamps, that she knew that the oil pool must be leaking, so she told Yang Chunxi, the storage and transportation section chief of the branch company. After Yang Chunxi learned about this situation, he went to the old lady's yard to take a look three days later, but did not take any emergency measures. Later, the Hebei Provincial Oils and Fats Company learned about it and immediately sent people to the local area together with the Dingxian Special Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce to conduct an inspection, and found that there were cracks in the No. 2 and No. 3 oil pools.

    However, the reason for the large consumption of oil stored at the branch company is definitely not just oil pool leakage. Because the No. 1 and No. 4 oil pools did not have cracks, but they were also like the No. 2 and No. 3 oil pools, each consuming more than 1,000 jin of oil in excess. The reason for the consumption has not yet been fully clarified. But one situation is worth noting: In December 1951, it was jointly decided by the then manager of the branch company, Han Chengbi, business section chief Li Denghan, and storage and transportation section chief Yang Chunxi, that several oil pools would be lent to private merchants who were purchasing peanut oil for the branch company at that time for a long time. During the period of lifting and pouring oil, there was no one in charge of inspection, weighing, acceptance, and account registration.

    The Hebei Provincial Oils and Fats Company sent responsible cadres to conduct three inspections on this incident, and twice submitted handling opinions to the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce (copied to the Dingxian Special Commissioner's Office), but the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce has not yet handled it. We believe that the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce should quickly and seriously handle this incident and give the negligent cadres and illegal cadres the punishment they deserve after investigating responsibility.

    坚决反对浪费国家资财的错误行为
    编者按：最近我们收到一些读者来信，揭露了河南省治淮总指挥部等单位不重视物资保管工作，造成了国家资财浪费的严重情况。应该指出：一粒小米或一袋水泥都是国家的财富，我们应该把这些物资合理地运用到祖国的建设工作中去，充分地发挥它们的作用；任何不爱护物资的浪费情况，都是直接或间接地破坏着祖国积累资金的错误行为。目前，祖国大规模的经济建设已经开始，节约物资和反对浪费的问题，在今后特别应该引起重视。我们希望热爱祖国的人民都来关心这个问题，无情地揭露各地已经存在着的浪费国家资财的现象，积极地提出各种有利节约的办法和意见。现在选登四封读者来信在下面：
    河南省治淮总指挥部积压水泥造成严重浪费
    编辑同志：河南省治淮总指挥部盲目扩大预算数字，积压了大量水泥，造成国家财产的严重损失。
    据检查，该部共存水泥三千多吨，有的存放已一年以上；再加上保管不善，水泥变质或结成硬块的很多。其中信阳仓库所存的一千多吨水泥已全部变质；其中有十分之一已结成了硬块，根本不能使用了。据估计，该部积压水泥所造成的损失约在十亿元左右。
    建议河南省治淮总指挥部立即采取有效办法处理这批水泥，以免国家财产遭受更大的损失。

    汤阴县合作社工作不负责任棉站所存棉籽大量发热霉烂
    编辑同志：我要向你们揭发一件令人痛心的事：河南省汤阴县合作社对棉籽保管工作不负责任，以致使大量棉籽发热、霉烂，国家财产受到损失，并且使当地群众加工制油的副业生产不能进行。
    去年十一月，我们中国油脂公司安阳办事处李荣钦同志到汤阴县去检查合作社组织油坊加工的工作时，发现该县合作社各棉站所存棉籽大量发热、霉烂。如隆华村、菜园集、皇甫村、瓦子岗村、伏道镇、闻石德村六个棉站所存棉籽，发热或霉坏的已有三十九万斤，折合人民币来计算，使国家财产损失一亿七千万元左右。造成这种情况的原因，是各棉站对棉籽保管工作不负责任。当地人民对这种情况有很多意见，有的说：“合作社太不爱惜国家财产，存了这么多的棉籽，也不用席子盖好，随它让风吹雨打。现在坏了的棉籽所值的钱，盖大场棚也用不完。”而更令人不能容忍的是：该县合作社对这种情况居然还不知道，直到去年十一月底李荣钦同志向他们反映了，他们才派干部到各棉站去检查。
    该县合作社受油脂公司委托，组织群众加工打油。但因该社棉站所存棉籽霉坏，出油率低，油质又坏，所以很多群众都不愿意和合作社订立棉籽加工合同；订了合同的人也不愿到棉站去领棉籽。菜园集棉站的干部在群众领取棉籽时，竟不许群众挑拣，说是“挨到坏的，就取坏的”。这更引起群众不满。有人就说：“人民政府号召我们搞副业生产，这样叫我们怎么搞呢？”
    这种损害国家利益现象的发生，是和安阳专区合作社的官僚主义作风分不开的。安阳全区每年产棉籽一亿多斤，可出油一千多万斤。但是，去年全年，专区合作社只和油脂公司订了二百二十万斤棉籽的加工合同；他们的理由是油坊加工不出来。但是他们对汤阴县合作社所存棉籽霉坏及群众不愿和合作社订加工合同的严重情形却不知道，或者是知道了而不督促解决。
    我认为：安阳专区合作社应该查究汤阴县合作社棉籽霉烂的问题，并纠正这种官僚主义的领导作风。  魏怀林
    建议检查处理武城县粮食局霉烂小麦和掩饰错误的行为
    编辑同志：武城县粮食局对国家资财漠不关心，使库存小麦大批霉烂。该局自一九五二年七月份小麦入仓后，从未进行出风扬晒，直到一九五二年十二月中旬才进行检查。这时粮垛上已冒热气，靠近粮食的席子已生了绿毛，上顶的麦子已结成饼块腐烂。全县仓房及露天散囤的小麦共二百二十余万斤，其中霉烂变质六千八百余斤，被虫蚀十六万五千斤；后经过筛，单虫蚀灰就筛出二千九百四十六斤。尤其严重的是，该局领导人发现这一情况后还不积极设法改善，反而为掩饰错误，将虫蚀粮与好小麦混合起来。这样既影响了好粮的品质，又增加了保管上的困难。
    检查前，该局已有同志发现小麦生虫，并建议应出风过筛。但该局领导人不但不采纳这一建议，反而训责提意见的人说：“你这是大惊小怪，粮食还不坏，过筛亏了秤，怎么办呢！”我建议当地政府对这种漠视祖国财产的人给以严厉的处分。

    河北省商业厅应即严肃处理定县油脂分公司蚀耗存油事件
    编辑同志：中国油脂公司定县分公司在去年发生了所存花生油超额蚀耗五千多斤，使国家财产受到严重损失的事件，但至今河北省商业厅尚未进行严肃处理。
    该分公司存油大量蚀耗的原因之一，是该分公司领导干部对存油保管工作不负责任，以致油池有裂隙而不能及时发现。直到去年七月上旬，住在该分公司隔壁的一位老太太看到有些小孩子在该分公司院墙外挖坑从土里取渗出来的油；又有些人用小勺子在该分公司院墙上刮油回家点灯，才知道一定是油池漏了，就告诉该分公司储运科长杨春喜。杨春喜知道这个情况后，隔了三天才到那位老太太的院子里看了一看，却不作任何紧急处理。后来河北省油脂公司知道了，立即派人会同定县专署工商科到当地进行检查，将存油起出，发现第二号、第三号两个油池有裂隙。
    但是，该分公司存油大量蚀耗的原因决不仅仅是油池漏油。因为第一号和第四号两个油池并无裂隙，但却也和第二号、第三号油池的情况一样，各超额蚀耗一千多斤油。蚀耗原因至今还没有完全搞清楚。但有一个情况是值得注意的：一九五一年十二月，该分公司经前任经理韩城壁、业务科长李登汉和储运科长杨春喜共同决定，曾把几个油池借给当时代分公司收购花生油的私商使用很久，其间起油倒油时检查、过磅、验收、注账等工作都没有专人负责。
    河北省油脂公司对这个事件曾派负责干部进行三次检查，并曾两次提出处理意见呈报河北省商业厅（抄致定县专署），但至今河北省商业厅尚未处理。我们认为：河北省商业厅应该迅速认真处理这个事件，追查责任后给失职干部和违法干部以应有的处分。  林三  曙风
