    Thirteen. Bao Tonghua and her child were allocated 2.6 mu of land. During the day, the mother and child worked in the fields; at night, Bao Tonghua spun cotton, wove cloth, and made shoe soles. In this way, they could manage their food and clothing.

    Fourteen. Bao Tonghua and her child lived frugally and saved some money to buy a small piglet. Every day, she went everywhere to collect grass scraps, water fleas, grind soybean dregs, pick up melon rinds, and went door to door to ask for dishwater to feed the piglet.

    Fifteen. The pig grew up, and the first litter yielded thirteen piglets, which were exchanged for more than one shi of grain. Afterward, with two litters each year, Bao Tonghua's life got better and better. The masses all said that Bao Tonghua was not only active in work but also skilled in production. Even her mother-in-law and husband dared not look down on her anymore.

    Sixteen. At this time, Bao Tonghua's husband's family also underwent some changes. Her parents-in-law often attended village meetings and understood many new principles. The two younger sisters-in-law, the elder one married, and the younger one joined the revolutionary work. When they came home, they often advised their mother to treat their daughter-in-law well.

    Seventeen. Zhang Tongting also became a militiaman in the village, his illness improved, and he was able to work much harder than before. Through the education of the new society, his attitude towards women also changed greatly. He often regretted mistreating Bao Tonghua in the past.

    Eighteen. In May 1950, the People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law. Bao Tonghua was a women's representative, and Zhang Tongting was a militiaman; both of them actively participated in the propaganda work of the Marriage Law. Whenever they talked about Article Eight, it touched their hearts, and Zhang Tongting felt particularly sad.

    暴同花

    （根据林钢所作“一个农家的悲喜剧”改编）
    十三、暴同花和孩子，分得了二亩六分地。白天娘儿俩下地生产；夜里暴同花纺花、织布、抐鞋底。这样，两个人的吃穿也顾住了。
    十四、暴同花和孩子省吃俭用，又积蓄了些钱买了个小猪子。她每天到四外捞渣草，捞水蜉，搓豆沫，拾瓜皮，又挨户去要涮锅水，喂这个猪子。
    十五、猪长大了，头一窝就见了十三个小猪娃，换了一石多粮食。以后，每年两窝，暴同花的日子就过得越来越好起来。群众都说，暴同花不但工作积极，也是生产的能手。连她婆婆和丈夫也不敢再小看她了。
    十六、这时候，暴同花的婆家也有了一些变化。公、婆常参加村上的会，懂得了不少新道理。两个小姑子，大的嫁了，小的参加了革命工作。她们回家来也常劝娘好好地对待媳妇。
    十七、张同廷也在村里当了民兵，病也好了，劳动比以前强得多了。经过新社会的教育，他对妇女的态度也大有转变。他常后悔过去不该虐待暴同花。
    十八、一九五○年五月，人民政府颁布了婚姻法。暴同花是妇女代表，张同廷是民兵队员，他们俩人都积极地参加了婚姻法的宣传工作。一讲到第八条，就触到他俩人的心事，张同廷特别觉得难过。
