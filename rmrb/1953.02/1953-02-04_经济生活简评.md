Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Oppose Wasteful Behavior of State Investment

    Saving state funds and opposing waste are important principles for our enterprise leaders and management work. Although this principle has been repeatedly emphasized countless times, many enterprise leaders and cadres have still not put it into practice. The reckless waste of state investment by Factory 121 and Factory 122 is one example.

    For a long time, Factory 121 and Factory 122 have had chaotic basic construction material storage management, resulting in serious waste, which the responsible cadres simply ignored. Subordinate cadres raised concerns, but they still ignored them. The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Factory 122 knew about this situation at the time but considered it an administrative matter. As one of the heads of the Party Committee, it is strange that he did not know his primary responsibility – to supervise the use of state investment. The factory director and deputy director passed by the special line every day, and the shocking waste of state investment was right in front of them, but they turned a blind eye. This situation is completely unacceptable!

    The mistakes of Factory 121 and Factory 122 illustrate that a strong bureaucratic style that is not deeply involved in specific work still exists among the responsible cadres in our state-owned enterprises. This is the main reason for the serious waste in these two factories. If this style is not changed, no matter how much they subjectively want to do a good job, and no matter how hard they work, there will be only one result: damaging the country's construction cause and delaying the country's industrialization process. Therefore, to truly save state investment and ensure that every penny is used where it is useful, responsible cadres must not relax their leadership over every specific task in basic construction, must regularly conduct in-depth inspections, meticulously familiarize themselves with every specific link, and solve specific problems. They must also educate all employees to implement economic accounting ideas and establish strict saving systems. Only in this way will saving state investment not become empty talk on paper.

    No Issuance of Disguised Currency Allowed

    Article 39 of the Common Program stipulates: "The right to issue currency belongs to the state." Therefore, the unauthorized printing and use of "quota notes," "substitute people's currency," and other disguised currencies by some cooperatives in Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, and other places is completely wrong and violates policy.

    In order to solve the difficulty of lacking working capital, they dare to undermine the state's policy of unified currency issuance. Their lack of organization and discipline has developed to a very serious degree. Individual leaders of branches of the People's Bank of China also lack sufficient understanding of this. After discovering these illegal activities, they neither seriously handled them nor promptly reported them to higher-level authorities for correction. This is also completely wrong. The Party and government leading organs in the aforementioned areas should seriously handle this issue, recall the already issued disguised currency within a time limit, and take appropriate action against the personnel involved to strictly prevent such incidents from continuing to occur.

    Cooperatives in various areas should recognize that in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds for cooperatives, they can only strengthen the planning of fund allocation, accelerate capital turnover, or request additional funding from higher-level authorities, or apply for loans from the People's Bank of China, and must never adopt the method of issuing disguised currency. The higher-level cooperatives in various areas should allocate funds in a timely manner so that the grassroots cooperatives will not be affected in their purchasing work due to the untimely allocation of funds.

    经济生活简评
    反对浪费国家投资的行为
    节约国家资金，反对浪费现象，是我们企业领导和管理工作的重要原则。这个道理虽然已经反复讲过无数次了，但至今仍有许多企业领导干部并没有身体力行。一二一厂和一二二厂毫不介意地浪费国家投资就是一个例子。
    一二一厂和一二二厂基本建设材料保管工作长期存在着混乱现象，浪费很严重，负责干部根本不管。下级干部提出了意见，他们还是不管。一二二厂的党委副书记当时知道这种情况，却认为是行政方面的事。作为党委负责人之一，竟然不知道自己主要的职责所在——监督国家投资的使用，这不是很奇怪的事吗？厂长、副厂长每天经过专用线，触目惊心的浪费国家投资的事实摆在那里，他们却熟视无睹。这种情况，是完全令人不能容忍的！
    一二一厂和一二二厂的错误说明：在我们国营企业的负责干部中，还存在着不深入具体工作的浓厚的官僚主义作风，这是这两个工厂产生严重浪费的主要原因。假如不改变这种作风，不管他们主观上如何想把工作做好，也不管他们工作如何辛苦，结果只有一个：损害了国家建设事业，推迟了国家工业化的进程。因此，要真正地节约国家投资，使每一文钱用在有用的地方，负责干部必须不放松对基本建设中的每个具体工作的领导，必须经常深入检查，细致地熟悉每个具体环节，解决具体问题。并教育全体职工贯彻经济核算思想，建立严格的节约制度。这样，节约国家投资才不会成为纸上空谈。
    不许发行变相货币
    共同纲领第三十九条规定：“货币发行权属于国家”。因此，河北、江苏、广东、内蒙等地部分合作社擅自印发、使用“定额票据”、“代人民券”等等变相货币，是完全错误的，违犯政策的。
    为了解决缺乏流动资金的困难，竟敢破坏国家统一发行货币的政策。他们的无组织无纪律已经发展到十分严重的地步。个别中国人民银行支行的领导干部对此也认识不足，他们发现这些违法行为以后，既不严肃地进行处理，又不及时报请上级机关设法纠正。这也是完全错误的。上述各地党、政领导机关应该认真处理这一问题，限期收回已经发行的变相货币，并对有关人员作适当的处理，严防这类事件继续发生。
    各地合作社应该认识：为了解决合作社资金不足的困难，只能加强资金调拨的计划性，加速资金周转，或向上级请求增拨资金，向人民银行进行贷款，绝不能采用发行变相货币的办法。各地合作社的上级社则应及时下拨资金，使基层社不致因下拨资金不及时而影响收购工作。
