    To adapt to the needs of the large-scale national economic construction and vigorously cooperate with basic construction work, cooperatives in North China and Northeast China have established site service departments, distribution outlets and other organizations at basic construction sites in their respective regions. Consumer cooperatives have also been established at construction sites where conditions permit, to solve the difficulties in the lives of workers and members.
    The characteristic of basic construction sites is the large concentration of workers from various places, and most of the sites are far from the city. Under such circumstances, workers often cannot buy things even with money; even some small daily necessities such as cigarettes and soap have to be bought after a long journey. If the living problems of workers cannot be solved well, it will affect the smooth progress of basic construction projects. According to the urgent needs of the workers, the cooperative established the above-mentioned supply organizations at the construction site, which played a great role in solving the living difficulties of the workers, members and their families at the basic construction site. For example, the Beijing New Urban Area United Consumer Cooperative has 22 distribution outlets, 11 of which are located at construction sites; last year, the Harbin Municipal Consumer Cooperative transferred 84 cadres with strong business capabilities and organized 20 construction site service departments of varying sizes suitable for the characteristics of basic construction. In addition to establishing fixed service departments at construction sites with a high concentration of workers, the Taiyuan Municipal Cooperative Federation also implemented on-site delivery in work areas with fewer workers and unsuitable for establishing service departments separately to meet the needs of workers and members.
    There are many difficulties in establishing service departments or consumer cooperatives at construction sites, but these difficulties have been overcome with the active efforts of cooperative cadres and the strong assistance of construction site administration and trade unions. When the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir construction site first established a consumer cooperative, there were no houses available. Cooperative cadres borrowed three rooms in an old temple nearby to serve as a sales department, and used a few old wooden boards to set up a counter. When the No. 012 construction site distribution outlet in the new urban area of Beijing was first established, it lacked business personnel. The trade union immediately selected a capable and reliable person from among the workers and recommended him to the cooperative as the business agent of the construction site distribution outlet. The administration quickly vacated a house and prepared the necessary furniture. When the distribution outlet was too busy, the trade union sent people to help. All this greatly helped the cooperative's business operations.
    In their operations, various construction site worker service departments or distribution outlets take the convenience of the workers into consideration in every aspect, and are therefore warmly supported by the workers and members. For example, the service department of the Third Engineering Office of Changchun City, Jilin Province, learned that a new group of construction workers' families had arrived, and prepared daily necessities for the families to supply them; when winter came, in order to solve the difficulty of workers buying cotton clothes, the service department promptly supplied 300 sets of cotton clothes and 280 autumn clothes. The construction site service department in Harbin City adjusted its business hours according to the work characteristics of basic construction workers so that workers could buy things at any time. The workers said with satisfaction: "With our construction site service department, it is really much more convenient to buy things." The establishment of construction site service departments and distribution outlets by cooperatives at construction sites not only solved the difficulties in the lives of workers, but also developed their own business and organization. For example, after the Harbin Municipal Cooperative established service departments at various construction sites, the amount of money sold increased by three or four times compared with before. Last year, the Beijing New Urban Area United Consumer Cooperative could only recruit an average of 10 members per day, but now it can recruit an average of 250 members per day (the vast majority are construction site workers).
    According to the experience of the Guanting Reservoir construction site consumer cooperative on the Yongding River, to do a good job in the supply of goods at the construction site, it is necessary to: 1. Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the different needs of construction site workers. Generally speaking, the purchasing power of workers and members is greater than that of rural members, and the requirements of technicians and staff among workers are different from those of ordinary workers. If the cooperative does not understand these characteristics, it cannot meet their needs well; 2. Understand the increase or decrease in the number of people at the construction site at any time, and formulate and revise the supply plan accordingly, otherwise it will cause a backlog or shortage of goods.

    华北东北等地合作社大力配合基本建设
    在工地设立商品供应机构受到工人社员热烈欢迎
    为适应国家大规模经济建设需要，大力配合基本建设工作，华北及东北等地合作社纷纷在各所在地区基本建设工地上建立起工地服务部、分销处等组织，并在条件具备的工地成立了消费合作社，以解决工人社员生活上的困难。
    基本建设工地的特点是各地工人大量集中，而且一般的工地都距离市区较远，在这种情况下，往往工人拿着钱买不到东西；甚至连一些纸烟、肥皂等零星日用品都要跑很远的路才能买到。工人生活问题不能得到很好解决，这会影响基本建设工程的顺利进行。合作社根据工人的迫切要求在工地建了上述供应机构，对解决基本建设工地工人社员及其家属生活上的困难起了很大作用。例如北京市新市区联合消费社现有二十二个分销处，其中有十一个分销处都设立在建筑工地；哈尔滨市消费合作社去年已先后抽调了八十四名业务能力较强的干部，组织了二十处规模大小不同、适合基本建设特点的工地服务部，太原市合作总社除在工人较集中的工地建立了固定的服务部外，并在工人人数较少不宜单独设立服务部的工区实行现场送货，以满足工人社员的需要。
    在工地建立服务部或消费社是有很多困难的，但在合作社干部积极努力和工地行政、工会的大力协助下，这些困难都得到克服。永定河官厅水库工地开始成立消费社时连房子都没有，合作社干部就借用了附近一座旧庙的三间房屋做为售货部，用几块旧木板架起来当柜台；北京新市区○一二工地分销处刚成立时缺少业务人员，工会就立刻从工人中选出了一位能干而可靠的人推荐给合作社做为工地分销处的业务员，行政上并很快地给腾出了房子，备置了必需的应用家具，该分销处业务忙不过来的时候工会还派人前来帮忙。这都大大地帮助了合作社的业务经营。
    各工地工人服务部或分销处等机构在经营中，都处处为着工人的便利着想，因而得到工人社员的热烈拥护。例如吉林省长春市第三工程处的服务部，了解到新来一批建筑工人家属，便准备了家属们日常必需的家具进行供应；冬季到来时，为解决工人购买棉衣的困难，服务部及时供应了三百套棉衣和二百八十件秋衣。哈尔滨市的工地服务部根据基本建设工人工作的特点调整了营业时间，使工人随时都可买到东西，工人们满意地说：“有了咱工地服务部，买东西可真方便多了。”合作社在工地成立工地服务部、分销处不仅解决了工人生活上的困难而且也发展了本身的业务与组织。例如哈尔滨市合作社在各工地成立服务部以后，卖钱额比以前增加了三、四倍；去年北京市新市区联合消费社平均每天只能吸收十个社员，现在平均每天可吸收二百五十个社员（绝大部分是工地工人）。
    根据永定河官厅水库工地消费合作社的经验，要做好工地的商品供应工作必须：一、确实调查了解工地工人的不同需要。一般说来工人社员的购买力比农村社员的购买力要大，而工人当中技工和职员的要求和一般工人的要求又有区别，合作社如不了解这些特点就不能很好地满足他们的需要；二、对工地人数的增减要随时进行了解，并据此制定和修改供应计划，不然就会造成商品积压或脱销的现象。
