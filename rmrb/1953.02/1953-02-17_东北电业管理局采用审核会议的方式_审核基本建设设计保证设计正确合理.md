Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. The Northeast Electric Power Administration has adopted the approach of design review meetings to examine the designs of basic construction projects, ensuring that the designs are correct and reasonable, saving the state 80 billion yuan in investment over the past year.

    The Northeast Electric Power Administration's design review meeting is primarily based on design management organizations and includes representatives from planning, production, construction units, and the original design departments. When necessary, the review meeting also invites representatives from testing laboratories, dispatching, materials, equipment, and other departments related to the design to participate in discussions. The scope of the review includes the project proposal, preliminary design, and technical design. The task of the review meeting is mainly to examine whether the above designs meet the requirements of correctness and reasonableness from political, economic, and technical aspects. The method of the meeting review is that the design management department prepares in advance before the meeting, puts forward key issues, and notifies the relevant representatives attending the meeting ten days or half a month in advance to prepare their opinions. Due to thorough preparation in advance and the attending representatives being familiar with the basic construction situation, many problems can be solved promptly after consultation, greatly shortening the review time. Now, their meetings to review the project proposals can generally solve problems in about four hours; the review of preliminary designs and technical designs can also be completed in just one to two days.

    The design review meeting of the Northeast Electric Power Administration implements a global perspective. For example, the Changchun Electric Power Bureau requested the construction of a new substation, requiring a cost of 6 billion yuan. Later, after discussion and research at the review meeting, everyone agreed that it was unnecessary to build a new substation based on this year's load situation. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the project during the review and concentrate the investment on the most needed projects. Thus, because the global perspective was implemented during the review, the bureau saved the state 25.3 billion yuan in investment simply by reducing or canceling three postponed and secondary projects. The design review meeting of the bureau also implemented the idea of economic accounting. For example, the Liaoyang Electric Power Bureau proposed that a certain section of the original transmission line was decayed and needed to be rebuilt with a double-circuit line and iron towers, with a total project cost of 37 billion yuan. When this budget was submitted to the review meeting for examination, the representatives of the planning and dispatching departments raised different opinions. They believed that the bureau's line was still in good condition. If the load increased, another circuit could be added to the original line, and there was no need to build a double-circuit line; they also suggested changing the iron towers to connecting pole supports, which would be both economical and would not hinder power transmission. The meeting adopted the opinions of these representatives and decided to reduce the project cost to 17 billion yuan. Savings of 3 to 4 billion yuan were also achieved by not installing transformers that were not urgently needed.

    In addition, the design review meeting also resolutely promoted the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union. For example, when designing the steel structure of a substation, the designers used the old-style square grid standard for design. At the review meeting, after a struggle against the old design thinking, the result was the adoption of the simple in form, easy to calculate, and material-saving Soviet "П" type and inverted "П" type steel structure design standards, which saved 560 million yuan for the project. In other aspects, such as the installation of transmission lines and lightning protection lines, after research at the meeting, it was affirmed that the advanced Soviet design standards should be adopted, which can not only improve the technical level of the project and save investment, but also ensure the safety of workers during operation. Through the design review meeting, the bureau not only solved various ideological problems and technical difficulties of the designers, but also accumulated experience for future designs. After two months of repeated discussions and revisions, the bureau has formulated a draft design standard for secondary substations and transmission lines. The design quality of secondary substations and transmission lines in this year's basic construction has been basically guaranteed, and the state investment of about 30 billion yuan has been saved.

    东北电业管理局采用审核会议的方式
    审核基本建设设计保证设计正确合理
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北电业管理局采用审核会议的方式，审核基本建设中的各项设计，保证了设计的正确合理，一年来为国家节省投资八百亿元。
    东北电业管理局设计审核会议是以设计管理机构为主，分别吸收计划、生产、施工单位及原设计部门的代表参加。必要时，审核会议还邀请与设计有关的试验所、调度、材料、设备等部门的代表参加讨论。审核的范围，包括计划任务书、初步设计与技术设计。审核会议的任务，主要是从政治、经济、技术三方面，审核上述各项设计是否达到正确合理的要求。会议审核的方法，是开会前由设计管理部门做好准备工作，提出关键性问题，提前十天或半月通知参加会议的有关代表准备意见。由于事先有了充分的准备，参加会议的代表又都熟悉基本建设的情况，所以许多问题在协商后都能及时解决，大大缩短了审核时间。现在他们审核计划任务书的会议，一般在四小时左右就可以解决问题；审核初步设计和技术设计，也只要一天到两天就完成了。
    东北电业管理局的设计审核会议贯彻了全局观点。例如长春电业局要求新建一个变电所，需要费用六十亿元。后来经过审核会议的讨论研究，大家一致认为按照今年的负荷情况，新建一个变压所是不必要的。因此，在审核时就决定缓办，并把这项投资集中使用到最需要的工程上去。这样，由于审核时贯彻了全局观点，该局只从削减或取消的三项缓办的及次要的工程上，就为国家节省了投资二百五十三亿元。该局的设计审核会议，还贯彻了经济核算思想。如辽阳电业局提出原有送电线某段已经腐朽，需要修建双回线和铁塔，全部工程费需要三百七十亿元。这个预算交由审核会议审查时，计划和调度部门的代表提出了不同的意见，他们认为该局的线路仍然良好，如果负荷增加，可在原线路上加一回线，不需要修建双回线；他们并建议把铁塔改为接脚杆，既经济又不妨碍送电。会议采纳这些代表的意见，决定把这项工程费核减为一百七十亿元。其余如对不急需使用的变压器一律不予装设等又节省资金三、四十亿元。
    此外，设计审核会议还坚决推行了苏联先进的设计经验。如某变电所设计铁构时，设计人员是采用旧式方格型标准进行设计的。在审核会议上，经过对旧设计思想的斗争，结果采用了形式简单、计算容易、节省材料的苏联“П”型和“П”型的铁构设计标准，使这项工程节约了五亿六千万元。其他如送电线、避电线的装设，经过会议研究后，都肯定了采用苏联的先进设计标准，既能提高工程技术水平，节省投资，又能保证工人操作时的安全。该局通过设计审核会议，不但解决了设计人员的各种思想问题和技术困难，还为今后的设计累积了经验。经过两个月的反复讨论与修正，该局已制订了二次变电所和送电线的设计标准草案。使今年基本建设中的二次变电所和送电线的设计质量，基本上得到保证，并节省了国家投资约三百亿元。
