Column: Answers to Readers' Questions

    Editor's Note: We have received many letters from readers asking about livestock insurance. We have asked the China People's Insurance Company Head Office to provide a comprehensive response as follows:

    Q: What is livestock insurance?

    A: Livestock insurance is a good way for everyone to help each other compensate for unexpected losses. Villagers who own livestock insure their animals with the insurance company and pay premiums. The insurance company pools these premiums to create an insurance fund. If a villager's livestock dies due to illness or an accident, or permanently loses all working ability, or if the local people's government orders it to be slaughtered to prevent the spread of an epidemic, the insurance company will be responsible for compensating the villager for their economic loss. This way, they can use the compensation to buy another animal and not have their life and production affected.

    Q: Why is the People's Government offering livestock insurance?

    A: Livestock are one of the most important tools for agricultural production at this stage. The People's Government is offering livestock insurance to protect and promote the development of agricultural production. In addition to compensating for the death of insured livestock due to illness or accidents, the insurance company will actively assist epidemic prevention institutions in conducting livestock epidemic prevention work and guide farmers to pay attention to livestock breeding and management in order to reduce livestock mortality. The China People's Insurance Company has been offering livestock insurance for more than three years and has achieved considerable success in this area. The livestock mortality rate in many places has gradually decreased.

    Q: How to participate in livestock insurance?

    A: All healthy livestock with normal working ability and proper feeding management (including cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, and camels, with the insurance company determining the age limit for each type of livestock based on local conditions) can be insured. After the livestock owner describes the color, height, sex, teeth, etc. of the livestock, the insurance company organizes the livestock owner, village cadres, and experienced villagers to assess the value of the livestock and underwrite it at 80% of the assessed value; the insurance period is one year. The insurance company issues an insurance certificate as proof; and the livestock owner must pay the insurance premium on time.

    Q: What should I do after participating in livestock insurance?

    A: Insurance is only compensation for the death of livestock due to illness or other force majeure accidents. In some places, because the cadres of the insurance company have not explained it clearly to the masses, some farmers mistakenly believe that insurance is a guarantee, and do not take good care of their livestock, or even abuse them, hoping that they will die so that they can receive compensation. This not only damages the development of national agricultural production, but is also detrimental to the livestock owner. Because if the livestock dies due to poor feeding management or abuse, the insurance company will not compensate. Therefore, after the livestock is insured, the livestock owner must still take good care of it and accept the guidance of the local epidemic prevention institution to ensure the health and safety of the livestock and reduce the mortality rate. If the livestock is sick, it should be taken to a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. If the insured livestock dies, the livestock owner should notify the insurance company, and after verification, they can receive compensation. If the livestock dies from a contagious disease, its carcass should be buried or burned to prevent the disease from spreading to other livestock.

    Q: What if the market price of livestock fluctuates after the livestock is insured?

    A: In different seasons, farmers have different needs for livestock, so the market price of livestock may fluctuate. In order to protect the interests of the livestock owner and the state, if the price of livestock rises or falls after insurance, the insurance company must be notified in a timely manner to complete the procedures for increasing or decreasing the insured amount. That is to say: if the price of livestock falls after insurance, the livestock owner should return the amount of the price drop to the insurance company, and the insurance company will refund the insurance premium according to regulations; if the price rises, they should apply to increase the insured amount and pay the insurance premium for the increased portion.

    有关牲畜保险的几个问题
    编者按：我们曾收到不少读者来信，询问有关牲畜保险的一些问题。现请中国人民保险公司总公司综合答复如下：
    问：什么叫做牲畜保险？
    答：牲畜保险是一种千家万户帮一家来补偿意外损失的好办法。有牲畜的老乡们向保险公司保了牲畜险，交了保险费；保险公司就把这些保险费集中起来做保险基金。如果有一位老乡的牲畜因为生病或遭到意外而死掉，或者永久全部丧失了劳动能力，或者得病后当地人民政府为了防止兽疫传染而命令宰杀的时候，保险公司就负责赔偿这位老乡的经济损失。这样，他就可以用赔款再买上一头牲畜，不会因此影响了生活和生产。
    问：人民政府为什么要办牲畜保险？
    答：牲畜是现阶段农业生产的重要工具之一。人民政府办牲畜保险就是为了保障和促进农业生产的发展。保险公司除了在保了险的牲畜得病或遭意外而死了时要负责赔偿外，还要积极协助兽疫防治机构进行牲畜防疫工作，指导农民注意牲畜的饲养管理，来减少牲畜的死亡。中国人民保险公司已经办了三年多的牲畜保险，在这方面收到不少成绩。很多地方的牲畜死亡率已逐步降低。
    问：怎样参加牲畜保险？
    答：凡是健康、有正常劳动能力和得到适当饲养管理的牲畜（包括牛、马、骡、驴、骆驼五种，保险公司根据各地具体情况酌定各种牲畜的年龄限制）都可投保。畜主说明牲畜的颜色、高低、性别、口齿等后，保险公司就组织畜主、村干部和有经验的老乡评定畜价，按八成承保；保险期是一年。保险公司发给保险证，作为凭证；而畜主必须按规定时间交清保险费。
    问：参加牲畜保险后应该怎么办？
    答：保险只是对牲畜因疾病或其它人力不可抗拒的意外灾害而致死亡时的一种补偿。在有些地方，因为保险公司的干部没有很好和群众说明白，有些农民就误解为保险就是包险，对牲畜不好好饲养管理，甚至任意虐害，想让它死了好领赔款。这不但使国家农业生产的发展受损失，对畜主也是不利的。因为牲畜如果是因饲养管理得不好或者被虐害死的，保险公司是不赔偿的。因此，牲畜保了险后，畜主还是要好好饲养管理，并接受当地兽疫防治机构的指导，保障牲畜的健康和安全，减少牲畜的死亡率。牲畜有病时应该到兽医处去诊治。保险的牲畜死了，畜主应通知保险公司，经查验属实即可领取赔款。如果牲畜是害传染病死的，应该将它的尸体埋掉或用火烧掉，以免把病传染给其它牲畜。
    问：牲畜投保后，如牲畜市价有上落怎么办？
    答：在不同的季节，农民对牲畜的需要不同，因此牲畜的市价就可能有上落。为了保障畜主和国家的利益，牲畜投保后如遇价格有上落时，必须及时向保险公司办理加保或退保的手续。这就是说：投保后牲畜价格落了，应该向保险公司退去落价部分的保额，由保险公司照章退还保险费；价格涨了，就应申请增加保额，交纳增加部分的保险费。
