    Serious Economic Crisis in Western European Countries Caused by Military Expansion
    U.S. Secretary of State-designate Dulles is "inspecting" the capitals of Western European countries, listening to reports on their military expansion. Whether in Rome, Paris, London or elsewhere, Dulles is encountering the same stark reality: military expansion has undermined the economies of Western European countries, and the serious economic crisis in Western European countries has made them unable to accelerate the pace of military expansion.
    Since the end of World War II, the United States has used a series of shackles, such as the "Marshall Plan" and the North Atlantic Treaty, to bind Western European countries, forcing them to embark on the path of military expansion, beginning in 1948. In particular, after the United States launched the Korean War in 1950, it increased pressure on Western European countries, forcing them to carry out large-scale military expansion and to turn their economies more and more fully onto a war footing. In order to maximize profits for monopoly capital, Western European governments have allocated huge sums of money to expand military production, maintain and increase armies, and build military bases. The Western European member states of the North Atlantic Group spent approximately $16 billion on military expenditures in the fiscal year 1952-1953, more than two and a half times their military expenditures in the fiscal year 1949-1950. In 1952, military expenditures in Western European countries such as Britain and France accounted for 30% to 50% of the national budget. Military spending by Britain and France accounts for more than 20% of the actual national income.
    The result of the United States forcing Western European countries to invest such large amounts of money and resources into non-productive military consumption, while satisfying the desires of some monopoly capital groups, has seriously harmed the national economies of Western Europe. The Western European economy was in a state of stagnation and decline in productivity before World War II. During World War II, the economies of Western European countries were severely damaged. Military expansion on an economic foundation where the wounds of war were far from healed after the war, therefore, the disastrous economic impact of this expansion was evident from the outset. At present, the Western European economy is experiencing a very serious crisis in all aspects of production, foreign trade and finance.
    The result of economic militarization is the one-sided development of military production. From 1949 to 1952, military production in Western European countries increased fourfold. On the other hand, due to the fact that military production swallowed up investment, equipment and raw materials of civilian industries, and due to the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets, civilian industries in Western European countries are constantly reducing production. The crisis in consumer goods industries such as textiles, shoes and food is particularly significant. In 1952, large numbers of textile factories closed down in Britain and Italy, and textile production in France also declined sharply. The crisis is not limited to light industry. Several heavy industrial sectors in Western Europe are also in crisis. Coal production in Britain and other Western European countries is still lower than before the war. The operating rate of the locomotive and carriage manufacturing industry in Italy is only 13%, the shipbuilding industry is only 33%, and the machine tool manufacturing industry is only 50%. The productivity of the French shipbuilding industry is only using two-thirds of its capacity. This reduction in consumer goods industries and certain heavy industries cannot be offset by the expansion of military production. The overall index of industrial production in Western Europe declined in 1952. Industrial production in Britain fell by almost 6 percent in 1952 alone.
    The state of foreign trade in Western Europe under military expansion is: on the one hand, a large amount of raw materials and materials for military expansion must be imported, thus increasing the imports of Western European countries year by year. On the other hand, due to the shrinking of domestic civilian industries, its export potential is constantly weakening. Due to the fact that Western European commodities are squeezed out by the United States, West Germany and Japan in the capitalist world market, and due to the United States' prohibition of trade between Western Europe and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the exports of Western European countries are declining. France's exports in 1952 were only half of those in 1951. Britain's total export trade in 1952 decreased by 30 million pounds compared with 1951. As a result, Western European countries have experienced serious trade deficits. Britain's trade deficit in 1952 reached 788 million pounds, France's trade deficit in the first half of 1952 reached 298.6 billion francs, and Italy's trade deficit in the first half of 1952 reached 301 billion lira. Due to the huge trade deficit, coupled with the United States dumping a large number of goods into Western Europe while not allowing Western European goods to be imported into the U.S. market, Western European countries are suffering from a serious dollar shortage in international payments. The gold and dollar reserves of the British pound sterling area have been constantly below the so-called danger level since 1952.
    The financial situation of Western European countries is also extremely chaotic. In order to raise huge military expansion expenses, Western European governments have massively increased taxes and issued banknotes indiscriminately. Since the end of World War II, tax revenues in Britain have increased twofold, in France by 2.6 times, and in Italy by 1.5 times. The scale of inflation is even more alarming. The amount of lira in circulation in Italy reached the astronomical figure of 1,179 billion in March 1952, which is 67.3 times the amount in circulation at the end of 1937. The amount of French francs in circulation reached the astronomical figure of more than 2,123.5 billion in December 1952, which is more than 22.5 times the amount in circulation at the end of 1937. The amount of British pounds in circulation reached 1.7 billion in the first half of 1952, which is 3.7 times the amount in circulation at the end of 1937. The indiscriminate issuance of banknotes devalued the currency. Even according to official figures that have been clearly reduced, the purchasing power of the lira in 1951 had fallen to less than 2 percent of its value in 1939. The franc fell to only 3.8 percent of its value in 1939 during the same period, and the pound fell to 32 percent. Moreover, despite such tax increases and indiscriminate issuance of banknotes, the fiscal deficits of Western European countries are still very huge. Italy's deficit in the first few months of the fiscal year 1952-1953 has reached more than 500 billion lira, France's deficit in 1952 reached 400 billion francs, and Britain's total deficit in the first nine months of the fiscal year 1952-1953 reached more than 900 million pounds. The governments of Western European countries are heavily indebted. By the end of 1951, France's national debt reached 4 trillion francs, Italy's national debt reached 2.8 trillion lira, and Britain's national debt reached 30 billion pounds. Even government officials in Western European countries have repeatedly admitted that Western European finances are on the verge of bankruptcy.
    All these economic crises weigh heavily on the working people of Western Europe. Inflation and soaring prices have caused the real wages of British workers in 1952 to fall by 20 percent compared with before the war. The real wages of French and Italian workers in 1952 were less than half of the pre-war level. Moreover, a considerable part of wage income has to be used to pay taxes. In 1952, the total amount of taxes in Western European countries swallowed up 47% to 60% of the average annual income per capita. Due to the shrinking of production, many workers in Western Europe are unemployed. Italy, France and Britain alone have a total army of 9 million unemployed and underemployed people. Soaring prices, taxes, and unemployment are lowering the living standards of the working people of Western Europe in three ways. The income of two-thirds of French workers is not enough to maintain a minimum standard of living. Western European people are eating and wearing much less. In 1952, the amount of butter eaten by British people was more than half less than before the war. Even feed for horses has increasingly become one of the main foods for Western European workers. The poverty of the people has drastically reduced their purchasing power, greatly shrinking the commodity sales market in capitalist countries, and creating conditions for the arrival of a new and greater economic crisis. Western European bourgeois newspapers are now anxiously discussing the issue of this "greater crisis."
    The United States, regardless of the serious economic crisis in Western Europe, is still using various pressures to demand that Western European countries accelerate their military expansion. Dulles went to Western Europe for this purpose. U.S. monopoly capital regards forcing Western Europe to expand its military as a means to enslave the people of Western Europe, control Western European countries, and weaken Western Europe's power to compete with the United States in the capitalist world market. The more serious the economic difficulties caused by military expansion in Western Europe, the more the United States can use this situation to manipulate the economic lifeline and political life of Western European countries, and the easier it is for the United States to squeeze out the forces of Western European countries, especially Britain, in the capitalist world market.
    However, this insidious and vicious calculation of the United States has encountered increasing obstacles. The people of a wide range of classes in Western European countries, burdened with the heavy burden of military expansion, are increasingly determined to demand an end to military expansion and a complete abandonment of the military expansion policy. Although the governments of Western European countries still insist on maintaining military expansion at the current huge level, they no longer dare to fully implement the U.S. order to accelerate military expansion. They fear that increasing the speed of military expansion will bankrupt them politically and economically. This is one of the reasons why Western European bourgeois newspapers are talking about the growing prevalence and intensity of anti-American sentiment in Western Europe.

### 西欧各国已因扩军而引起严重经济危机

    西欧各国已因扩军而引起严重经济危机
    美国新上任的国务卿杜勒斯正在“巡视”西欧各国首都，听取这些国家扩张军备情况的报告。无论在罗马、巴黎、伦敦或其他地方，杜勒斯都碰到同样一种冷酷的现实：扩张军备已经破坏了西欧各国的经济，西欧各国严重的经济危机已经使它们无力再加快扩军的速度。
    自第二次世界大战结束以后，美国在一九四八年起即用“马歇尔计划”、北大西洋公约等一连串的枷锁套在西欧各国身上，强迫它们走上扩张军备的道路。特别是美国在一九五○年发动朝鲜战争以后，更对西欧各国增加压力，迫使它们大规模地进行扩军，并把它们的经济愈来愈全面地转上战争轨道。西欧各国政府为了使垄断资本获取最大的利润，都拨出巨大的款项，来扩充军事生产，维持及增加军队，建设军事基地。北大西洋集团西欧成员国在一九五二年至一九五三年会计年度的预算中，军事费用共达一百六十亿美元左右，这个数目比它们在一九四九年至一九五○年会计年度中的军事费用增加二倍半以上。在一九五二年，英法等西欧国家的军事费用在国家预算中已占到百分之三十至五十。英国及法国的军事开支已占全国实际国民收入的百分之二十以上。
    美国强迫西欧各国把这样大量的金钱和资源投入非生产性的军事消费的结果，虽然满足了一部分垄断资本集团的欲望，但是，它却严重地危害了西欧的国民经济。西欧经济在第二次世界大战以前就处于生产力停滞不前的衰落状态。在第二次世界大战中，西欧各国经济更遭到严重的破坏。大战后在战争创伤还远未医治好的经济基础上就进行扩张军备，因此这种扩军在经济上的灾难性影响从一开始起就很明显。目前，西欧经济在生产、对外贸易及财政等各方面都呈现出十分严重的危机。
    经济军事化的结果就是军事生产的片面发展。从一九四九年到一九五二年，西欧国家军事生产增加了四倍。而在另一方面，由于军事生产吞去了民用工业的投资、装备和原料，由于国内外市场的缩小，西欧各国民用工业不断减产。纺织、鞋及食品等消费品工业的危机尤其显著。在一九五二年，英国和意大利都发生大批纺织厂倒闭的现象，法国纺织生产也急剧下降。危机不仅限于轻工业。西欧若干重工业部门也处于危机中。英国及其他西欧国家的煤产量仍低于战前。意大利机车及车厢制造工业开工率仅百分之十三，造船工业开工率仅百分之三十三，母机制造工业开工率仅百分之五十，法国造船工业的生产力也仅使用了三分之二。这种消费品工业及若干重工业的缩减程度已不是军事生产的膨胀所能抵销，西欧工业生产总指数在一九五二年已趋下降。英国工业生产在一九五二年一年中几乎下降了百分之六。
    在扩张军备下的西欧对外贸易的情况是：一方面要大量输入供扩军用的原料和物资，因此使西欧各国的输入正逐年增加。另一方面由于国内民用工业的萎缩而使其输出潜力不断减弱，由于西欧商品在资本主义世界市场遭到美国、西德及日本的排挤，由于美国禁止西欧与苏联及人民民主国家贸易，西欧各国的输出都在下降。法国在一九五二年的输出仅及一九五一年的一半，英国一九五二年的出口贸易总额比一九五一年减少了三千万英镑。这样，西欧各国在贸易上都产生了严重的入超现象，英国在一九五二年贸易入超达七亿八千八百万英镑，法国在一九五二年上半年中的贸易入超达二千九百八十六亿法郎，意大利在一九五二年上半年中贸易入超达三千零十亿里拉。由于贸易上的巨额入超，加上美国大量向西欧倾销货物而又不准西欧货物输入美国市场，西欧各国在国际支付上都闹着严重的美元荒。英国的英镑区黄金美元储备额自一九五二年以来已经常处于所谓危险水平之下。
    西欧各国的财政情况也极其紊乱。为了筹措庞大的扩军费用，西欧各国政府都大量增税和滥发纸币。自第二次世界大战结束以来，英国税收增加为二倍，法国二点六倍，意大利一点五倍。通货膨胀的规模更为惊人。意大利的里拉的流通额在一九五二年三月达一万一千七百九十亿的天文数字，为一九三七年底时流通额的六十七点三倍，法国的法郎流通额在一九五二年十二月达二万一千二百三十五亿多的天文数字，为一九三七年底时流通额的二十二点五倍多。英国的英镑流通额在一九五二年上半年达十七亿，为一九三七年底时流通额的三点七倍。滥发纸币就使通货贬值，即使根据官方显然缩小了的数字，里拉在一九五一年的购买力已跌到不及一九三九年时价值的百分之二，法郎在同一时期中下跌到只为一九三九年价值的百分之三点八，英镑跌到百分之三十二。而且，尽管这样增税及滥发纸币，西欧各国财政赤字依然十分巨大，意大利在一九五二年至一九五三年会计年度的头几个月中赤字已达五千多亿里拉，法国在一九五二年中赤字达四千亿法郎，英国在一九五二年至一九五三年会计年度头九个月中总赤字达九亿多英镑。西欧各国政府都债务累累，到一九五一年底为止，法国国债达四万亿法郎，意大利国债达二万八千亿里拉，英国国债达三百亿英镑。甚至西欧各国政府官员也一再承认：西欧财政已濒于破产。
    所有这些经济危机的重担都压在西欧劳动人民的身上。通货膨胀，物价飞涨，已使英国工人在一九五二年中的实际工资比大战前下降了百分之二十，法国和意大利工人在一九五二年中的实际工资尚不及战前水平的一半。而且，工资收入中还有相当一部分要用来交纳捐税，西欧各国捐税总额在一九五二年中吞没了每一人口平均全年所得的百分之四十七至六十。由于生产的萎缩，西欧还有很多工人失业，仅意大利、法国和英国三国就共有九百万失业及半失业的大军。物价飞涨、捐税、失业从三方面压低着西欧劳动人民的生活水平。法国三分之二的工人的收入不够维持最低限度的生活水平。西欧人民穿的和吃的都大大减少了。一九五二年英国人所吃的奶油数量比战前少一半以上。甚至饲马料也已日益成为西欧工人的主要食物之一。人民的贫困，就使他们的购买力急剧降落，使资本主义国家商品销售市场大大缩小，而造成新的更大的经济危机到来的条件。西欧资产阶级报纸目前已在忧心忡忡地谈论着这种“更大的危机”的问题了。
    美国不顾西欧的这样严重的经济危机，现在仍在使用各种压力要求西欧国家加速扩军。杜勒斯到西欧去就是为了这个目的。美国垄断资本是把强迫西欧扩张军备，作为奴役西欧人民、控制西欧各国、削弱西欧在资本主义世界市场上与美国竞争的力量的一种手段。西欧因为扩军而引起的经济困难越严重，美国就愈能利用这种情况来操纵西欧各国的经济命脉和政治生活，美国就愈容易在资本主义世界市场上排挤西欧国家，首先是英国的势力。
    但是，美国这种阴险毒辣的盘算已经遇到越来越大的障碍了。身负扩军重担的西欧各国广泛阶层的人民正在日益坚决地要求停止扩军，根本废弃扩军政策。西欧各国政府虽然仍然坚持要把扩军维持在目前的巨大规模的水平上，然而它们已经不敢再完全执行美国要求加速扩军的命令了，它们害怕再增加扩军的速度就要使它们在政治上和经济上完全破产。这就是西欧各国资产阶级报纸正在纷纷谈论着的西欧反美情绪日益普遍和强烈的一个原因。
