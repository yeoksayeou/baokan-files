The winter training of basic construction workers in various places is underway. Political education is one of the central tasks of winter training. The "Political Textbook for Winter Training of Basic Construction Workers" is specifically compiled for political education work during winter training in Northeast China. The spirit of the textbook is focused on inspiring the class consciousness of the working class and establishing the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters of the country. This textbook can be used as a reference for political education work during winter training in various places.

The textbook explains the following four aspects in detail.

First, the textbook first provides a concrete and vivid introduction to our great motherland, thereby powerfully inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for loving and building the motherland. Furthermore, the textbook describes the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, pointing out that the Chinese revolution can only achieve victory under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party). Next, the textbook explains the great achievements of the new China in the past three years under the leadership of the working class, encouraging workers to participate in large-scale national construction work with full confidence. Finally, the textbook, through a comparison of the changing status of the working class in the old and new China, illustrates the change in the nature of labor for workers in the new China, and that every worker should adopt a new creative attitude towards labor.

Second, the textbook explains the significance of the motherland's large-scale economic construction, and the position and future of basic construction in national construction. The textbook points out that basic construction has been elevated to the primary position in national construction, and basic construction workers are standing on the most glorious posts. The quality of basic construction is directly related to the consolidation of the motherland's defense; related to the speed of the motherland's construction and the future of socialism; and also related to the growth of the motherland's science and culture, and the improvement of people's living and housing conditions. Therefore, some basic construction workers believe: "A stinking bricklayer is still muddy and dirty, lowly and despicable. There is no future in this line of work." This idea is wrong. At the same time, the textbook also provides appropriate explanations for the concerns of some workers about unemployment. This idea is: "Although basic construction is important, building a few large buildings can be completed in a year and a half, and at most two or three years we will have nothing to do, so what's the point!" In response, the textbook points out: "Human production and life must always develop and improve. In socialist and communist societies, it will still be necessary to build new factories and produce more things. Therefore, basic construction is the most promising job."

Next, the textbook explains the significance of the development of basic construction towards mechanization and factory production, as well as the great role of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promoting creations and inventions in various places. The textbook points out: The mechanization and factory production of basic construction not only saves labor for the country and reduces the physical labor of workers, but also concentrates and fixes temporary and dispersed construction organizations. In the minds of basic construction workers, it can overcome the guild mentality and loose work style cultivated in small-scale production, and strengthen their collectivity, organization and discipline. The mechanization and factory production of basic construction is our future vision. In our country, it can only be gradually realized in a focused manner at certain construction sites. Under the existing conditions, in order to improve the labor organization, production tools and operating methods of basic construction, and to carry out basic construction "faster, better, and more economically," we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of basic construction in the Soviet Union and promote creations and inventions in various places. At the same time, we must also eliminate the various ideological concerns and technological conservatism of workers in learning advanced experiences. Because earnestly learning from the advanced Soviet basic construction experience and vigorously promoting creations and inventions in various parts of our country is an important key to the transition of basic construction in our country from handicraft to mechanization and factory production.

Third, the textbook explains several specific policies related to the interests of workers: the labor protection policy and labor insurance policy of the new China, the wage system and the enterprise democratic management system. Through a comparison of the labor system in the old and new China, and through the concern of the Party and the government for the interests of the working masses, basic construction workers can further realize the consistency of personal interests and national interests, and that individuals should obey the needs of the country and engage in creative labor; at the same time, every employee can actively carry out the above-mentioned work with the attitude of being the master of the country.

Finally, the textbook conducts education on the basic knowledge of the Party. This is education on the nature and tasks of the Communist Party of China, and education on the nature and tasks of the Party's assistants—the trade union and the Youth League. After this part of the study, outstanding basic construction workers will be admitted into the Party; at the same time, the organizations of the trade union and the Youth League will be expanded and consolidated. Therefore, this part of the course is also about the ideological education of communism and the Communist Party, and the organizational education of the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League.

In addition to the above content, the language of the entire textbook is concise and clear. In solving workers' ideological problems, the textbook also avoids the shortcomings that are often easily produced: it does not start from the positive side to educate workers, and does not first discover the advanced things of the working class to educate the backward workers, but first focuses on finding the shortcomings of the working masses and criticizing the backwardness of the working masses. When solving some workers' ideological problems, this textbook focuses on enlightening the consciousness of the working masses from the positive side and patiently guiding the workers to move forward. Because only by actively improving the understanding of the working masses and establishing role models of advanced figures for the working masses can the backward phenomena among the working masses be overcome more effectively. In addition, each lesson in the textbook is accompanied by a simple central summary, appropriate reference documents, and film introductions that can be used for coordination. These learning aids are also helpful for improving teaching effectiveness.

The textbook also has some points that are not sufficiently explained and should be supplemented. First of all, in view of the characteristics of basic construction workers, the textbook is not sufficient in explaining the characteristics and historical role of the working class. Because there are still many basic construction workers who do not know what the working class is. Therefore, explaining the class characteristics and its historical role of the working class to basic construction workers will better enable them to draw a clear line between the working class and non-working classes and improve their class consciousness. Secondly, in the various lessons on Party education, the textbook mentions the issues related to the Party Constitution, which is very necessary. However, the textbook does not mention the regulations on the standards for members of the Communist Party of China adopted by the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and approved by the Party Central Committee. This should be supplemented.

    介绍“基本建设工人冬训政治教材”

    各地基本建设工人的冬季训练工作正在进行。政治教育工作是冬季训练工作中心任务之一。“基本建设工人冬训政治教材”就是专为东北各地冬训政治教育工作而编写的。课文精神集中在启发工人阶级的阶级觉悟，树立工人阶级国家主人翁的责任感。这本教材可以作为各地冬训政治教育工作的参考。
    教材具体地讲解了下列四个方面的问题。
    第一、教材首先对于我们伟大的祖国作了具体生动的介绍，从而有力地鼓舞了工人们热爱祖国与建设祖国的热情。进而教材描述了中国工人阶级与中国人民的革命斗争，指出了中国革命只有在工人阶级的领导下（通过共产党），才能取得胜利。接着，教材讲解了在工人阶级领导下，新中国三年来的伟大成就，鼓励了工人们满怀信心地去参加大规模的国家建设工作。最后，教材通过新旧中国工人阶级地位变化的对比，说明了新中国工人劳动性质的改变，每个工人都应当采取新的创造性的劳动态度。
    第二、教材说明了祖国大规模经济建设的意义，和基本建设在国家建设中的地位与前途。教材指出：基本建设已提到国家建设的首位，基本建设工人是站在最光荣的岗位上。基本建设的好坏，直接关系着祖国国防的巩固；关系着祖国建设的速度，和社会主义的前途；也关系着祖国科学文化的增长，人民生活与居住条件的改善。因此，有的基本建设工人认为：“臭泥瓦匠，说啥也是泥手泥脚，低微下贱。干这行没有出息。”这种想法是不对的。同时，教材对另一些工人怕失业的想法，也作了适当的解释。这种想法就是：“基本建设虽然重要，但是盖几幢大楼，一年半载就能完事，至多两三年我们就没事干了，那有啥劲头呀！”对此，教材指出：“人类的生产和生活是总要发展和提高的，到了社会主义和共产主义社会，还是要建设新工厂，生产更多的东西。所以说，基本建设这件工作是最有前途的工作。”
    接着，教材讲解了基本建设向机械化、工厂化方向发展的意义，以及学习苏联先进经验和推广各地创造发明的伟大作用。教材指出：基本建设走向机械化、工厂化，不仅给国家节省了劳动力，减轻了工人们的体力劳动；而且能把临时性的分散的施工组织，集中起来，固定起来。在基本建设工人的思想上，可以克服小生产中养成的行会思想与散漫作风，加强他们的集体性、组织性与纪律性。基本建设的机械化和工厂化，那是我们未来的远景。在我国还只能有重点地在某些工地开始逐步实现。我们在现有的条件下，为了改进基本建设的劳动组织、生产工具和操作方法，使基本建设进行得“又快、又好、又省力”，那么就必须认真学习苏联基本建设的先进经验，推广各地的创造与发明。同时，也必须消除工人们学习先进经验中的种种思想顾虑，和技术上的保守思想。因为认真地学习先进的苏联基本建设经验，大力推广我国各地的创造和发明，就是我国基本建设从手工业向机械化、工厂化过渡的重要关键。
    第三、教材讲解了几个有关工人利益的具体政策：新中国的劳动保护政策与劳动保险政策，工资制度与企业民主管理制度。通过新旧中国劳动制度的对比，通过党与政府对工人群众利益的关怀，可以进一步使基本建设工人认识到个人利益与国家利益的一致，个人应服从国家的需要，进行创造性的劳动；同时，也可以使每个职工以国家主人翁的态度来积极搞好上述工作。
    最后，教材进行了关于党的基本知识的教育。这就是关于中国共产党的性质与任务的教育，关于党的助手——工会、青年团的性质与任务的教育。经过这部分学习之后，优秀的基本建设工人，将被吸收入党；同时，也会扩大与巩固工会与青年团的组织。因此，这一部分课程，又是关于共产主义与共产党的思想教育，关于党、工会、青年团的组织教育。
    除上述内容外，整个教材的文字是简洁明白的。在解决工人思想问题方面，教材也避免了常常容易产生的缺点：不是从正面入手去教育工人，不是首先去发现工人阶级先进的东西来教育落后的工人，而是首先着重去找寻工人群众的缺点，批判工人群众的落后。这本教材在解决一些工人思想问题时，则是着重地从正面去启发工人群众的觉悟，耐心地引导工人们前进。因为只有积极地提高了工人群众的认识，向工人群众树立了先进人物的榜样之后，才能更有力地去克服工人群众中的落后现象。此外，教材每课之后，还附有简单的中心提要，恰当的参考文件和可资配合的电影介绍。这些学习补助材料，也是有助于教学效果的提高的。
    教材也有一些说明得不够充分和应该补充的地方。首先，针对基本建设工人的特点，教材在讲解有关工人阶级特点和历史作用方面，还是不够充分的。因为还有许多基本建设工人，不知道什么是工人阶级。因此，向基本建设工人说明工人阶级的阶级特点与它的历史作用，将会更好地使他们划清工人阶级与非工人阶级的界限，提高他们的阶级觉悟。其次，在进行有关党的教育的各课中，教材讲到了有关党章部分的问题，这是非常必要的。但是，教材对于中国共产党第一次全国组织会议所通过、经党中央批准的中国共产党党员标准问题的规定，却没有提及。这是应当补充的。
