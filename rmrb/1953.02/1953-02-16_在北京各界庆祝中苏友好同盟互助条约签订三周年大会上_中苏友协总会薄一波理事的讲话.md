Comrades:

    As we warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we should extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the Soviet experts who have been engaged in selfless labor in all sectors of our national economy over the past three years to help restore and develop our economy, and who have demonstrated a brilliant example of socialist country laborers before the Chinese people. We should extend our heartfelt gratitude to the great Comrade Stalin and the Soviet government for sending them to China to accomplish this lofty mission.

    Not long ago, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "No capitalist country can provide the people's democratic countries with genuine help and technically proficient assistance like the Soviet Union. The issue is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The issue is primarily the basis of this cooperation, which is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve common economic prosperity." For the past three years, Soviet experts have been helping China's economic construction entirely in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instruction.

    The assistance given to us by Soviet experts is multifaceted. In the past three years, every important measure in our economic life has been guided by their advanced technology, and the benefits our country has gained from their assistance are incalculable. The great achievements our national economy has made in recovery and transformation over the past three years, from healing the wounds caused by the long-term war to fundamentally improving the financial and economic situation and preparing the various conditions necessary for implementing the first Five-Year Plan, would have been much more difficult for us and we would not have achieved such great achievements in a short period of time without the sincere and selfless assistance of Soviet experts.

    Take industry, for example. Soviet experts have taught us many advanced technical operating methods and production management methods, which have greatly improved the potential of our industrial equipment, enabling many of our factories to rapidly restore production and exceed the highest historical levels without adding equipment. In just three years, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel has exceeded 72 percent of the Manchukuo period, and the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace has exceeded 39 percent of the Manchukuo period. The Northeast Machinery Third Factory used to produce only 50 machines per quarter, but now it can produce 100 machines per month. These major achievements were obtained with their assistance. Thanks to the new coal mining methods recommended by Soviet experts, the recovery rate of our coal mines has increased from 30 percent in the past to 80 percent, which is equivalent to increasing a large amount of coal resources for our country. Soviet experts have also formulated reconstruction plans for our coal mines, enabling many mines that were originally to be abandoned to extend their life by 20 to 40 years, which is equivalent to adding many new mines to our country. Based on the suggestions of experts, our power plants have implemented a regular maintenance system. Machines that were previously used as backups are no longer needed, machines that were previously thought to be impossible to reach nameplate output can now reach it, and old machines that were thought to be scrapped for more than 30 years can now operate like new machines. They helped us discover many new oil deposits, proving that our country is rich in oil reserves, and changing the erroneous concept that our country's oil resources were poor in the past. They have designed many of the latest factories and mines for our country, some of which have been installed with machines and started production with their own help. Seeing the difficulty of our country's lack of wood and insufficient pulp equipment, they researched and successfully trial-produced the straw semi-pulp papermaking method, so as to make paper with straw and open up new prospects for our country's papermaking industry.

    In agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, Soviet agricultural experts have given us great assistance in crop systems and cultivation methods. For example, the technique of dense planting of crops was introduced, which greatly increased crop yields. In the past, our country planted only 1,500 to 2,500 cotton plants per mu, but now we plant 3,000 to 4,000 plants. As a result, the cotton yield per mu in cotton fields that adopted the cotton dense planting technology increased by 50 to 100 percent; the yield of wheat fields that adopted the wheat dense planting method increased by more than one time. After livestock and veterinary experts introduced new technologies for livestock feeding management, sick animal isolation and treatment, bovine plague in our country was basically eliminated, and the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, which was widespread in nine provinces in 1951, was stopped. Forestry experts recommended advanced timber harvesting methods, reducing the stump from 70 cm to below 20 cm, increasing the utilization rate of forests. Water conservancy experts helped us correctly understand the role of water, corrected the thinking of purely discharging water among our cadres, and established the idea that "water is the wealth of the people and must be stored and used" among the cadres, changing the water management work from passively eliminating harm to combining harm elimination and promoting benefits. The major technical problems of our Huai River management project, Jingjiang flood diversion project and many other water conservancy projects were also solved with the help of Soviet experts.

    In terms of transportation, the first thing to point out is the merit of Soviet experts in helping us repair railways. In 1949, when the Kuomintang bandit army was retreating steadily, the national railway suffered unprecedented destruction, and there were not many lines that could be fully opened to traffic at that time. With the enthusiastic help of the experts, the railways across the country were repaired one by one at a magical speed, which played a major role in accelerating the liberation of the country and the restoration of the national economy. The Yellow River Railway Bridge of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which has been in existence for more than 50 years and has exceeded the insurance period by more than 30 years, was long overdue for scrapping in the view of British and American bourgeois technology, but with the advice and help of Soviet experts, we carried out five reinforcement projects, and now it has become a brand new railway bridge. Inland river transportation implemented the one-column towing method recommended by experts, increasing the towing capacity of each horsepower from three tons to fourteen tons. In highway construction, experts helped us formulate highway engineering standards, improve transportation efficiency and save materials by more than 20 percent. Experts only reviewed and revised the route design of a highway in South China, which saved our country 100 billion yuan.

    In terms of finance, experts helped us learn how to focus on income, how to save expenses, and preliminarily helped us establish a system of enterprise financial management, and helped us establish bank transfer clearing methods.

    In terms of trade and cooperation, Soviet experts have repeatedly pointed out that we should carefully study the needs of residents, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, and taught us many advanced management methods in this regard.

    In terms of planning and statistics, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, we have established the necessary systems for planning and statistical work, and have begun to learn how to prepare annual plans and five-year plans, which is one of the necessary conditions for us to start implementing the five-year plan this year.

    In terms of basic construction work, Soviet experts have helped us with a lot of work in geological exploration, design, construction and installation, helped us establish the necessary rules and systems, and helped us solve many complex technical problems in practical work, which has given a good start to the huge construction work.

    Soviet experts have given us tremendous help in China's cultural and educational construction, such as the reform of China's school system, the revision of teaching plans, the improvement of teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching organization, the development of people's medical and health services and the film and broadcasting industries. Especially in the reform of higher education, with the specific help of Soviet experts, we adopted the Soviet experience and divided universities into comprehensive universities, specialized colleges and specialized schools, thereby carrying out a comprehensive departmental adjustment, and set up various majors according to the needs of national construction for various talents, and gradually applied Soviet textbooks; at the same time, Soviet experts enthusiastically helped us train a large number of new teachers, establish teaching and research groups and classroom discussion work, so that China's higher education gradually changed its face and became more suitable for the needs of the country.

    In terms of political and legal work, with the help of Soviet experts, we have formulated important laws and regulations such as the Labor Law. They have systematically introduced the Soviet legal system theory and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in legislation, judicature, procuratorate and ethnic minorities, which has greatly improved the professional level of our political and legal cadres.

    In addition to the above-mentioned aspects, Soviet experts in other departments have also helped us complete a lot of work and made many outstanding contributions in the past three years, which will not be listed here one by one.

    The combination of the advanced technology of Soviet experts and the enthusiasm of the Chinese people has produced so many miracles in China's economic life that were historically unimaginable. Doesn't this prove that the Soviet assistance mentioned by Comrade Stalin is "sophisticated" and "first-class" in technology?

    Not only that, but they are sincere and faithful in helping our country. They often ask our cadres to treat their work with the greatest sense of responsibility; to save every penny of the country. When they see our equipment discarded on the ground due to poor storage, they always give us comradely criticism and suggestions; when they see us ordering equipment from the Soviet Union that our country can manufacture ourselves, they always suggest that we manufacture it ourselves and not waste foreign exchange. When they go to factories to help with work, they always ask our cadres to care about the lives and safety of the workers, and often say that people are the most valuable asset of the country. And they themselves show a lofty spirit of self-sacrifice in their work. For example, one expert's eye disease relapsed due to overwork on the construction site, and the condition was very serious, but he refused all advice and was unwilling to rest. The doctor said that if he did not rest, he would be in danger of blindness, but he was still unwilling to leave his work. Finally, he had to cover the doors and windows of the house where he lived on the construction site with black curtains and forbid him to use his eyes to work. In this house, with thick gauze covering his eyes, he still constantly provided many valuable opinions. Another expert, in order to promote new operating methods in a cement factory, climbed a very high chimney with a temperature of more than 100 degrees, regardless of the danger, to check the adjustment of the temperature in order to check the operating effect of the workers. In order to improve the operating technical level of the workers, he often braved the high temperature of the large kiln and worked at the kiln head for eight hours, observing the workers' operations with his own eyes. When performing a technical task, he drilled into the dusty kiln to guide the installation and worked for more than 30 hours in a row. When others advised him to rest, he refused to rest and asked others to take turns to rest. Due to the hard work, he was sick several times, but while he was sick, he still called the site two or three times a day to ask about the progress of the work and put forward solutions to difficult problems. These examples are too numerous to mention, and almost all experts are working with such a spirit. Our workers and technicians who have been in contact with them have been greatly moved and truly educated by their lofty spirit. The broad masses of Chinese workers respect them, love them, and regard them as their dearest brothers and sisters, and as an example they should learn from.

    Our five-year construction plan has just begun. There is still a lot we should learn from the Soviet Union. We are implementing Chairman Mao Zedong's call: "We must learn from the Soviet Union. We must carry out great national construction, our work is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is inside or outside the Communist Party, old cadres or new cadres, technicians, intellectuals, workers and peasants, we must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." This is of decisive significance for us to successfully complete the first five-year plan. We are overcoming all obstacles and difficulties in this learning process, overcoming the conservative thinking and lazy thinking of some people, emulating the revolutionary spirit and pragmatic attitude of the Soviet people, and actively learning the infinitely rich and infinitely valuable experience accumulated by the Soviet Union over the past 30 years to build our country.

    We must not only learn from the Soviet people's experience in building the country and their advanced technology, but also learn from their great internationalist spirit. Our cadres should emulate the example of Soviet experts, and be ready at any time to use all their talents to build our motherland, strengthen the strength of the great peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defend world peace, and accelerate the final victory of the liberation struggle of the working people all over the world.

    Long live the permanent friendly alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the most respected friend and mentor of the Chinese people!

    在北京各界庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年大会上
    中苏友协总会薄一波理事的讲话同志们：
    当我们热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年的时候，我们应当向三年来在我国国民经济的一切部门为了帮助我国经济的恢复和发展而进行了奋不顾身的劳动，并在我国人民面前表现了社会主义国家劳动者光辉榜样的全体苏联专家们致以衷心的感谢。我们应当向派遣他们来到中国完成这个崇高使命的伟大的斯大林同志与苏联政府致以衷心的感谢。
    不久以前，斯大林同志曾指出：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”三年来苏联专家们就是完全按照斯大林同志这一指示帮助我国经济建设的。
    苏联专家们给予我们的帮助是多方面的，三年来我们经济生活中的每一个重要措施，都受到他们先进技术的指导，我们的国家从他们的帮助中所获得的利益是无法计算的。三年来我国国民经济在恢复和改造方面所获得的伟大成就，从医治我国在长期战争中所造成的创伤到财政经济情况的根本好转并准备好实行第一个五年建设计划所必需的各种条件，这一切如果没有苏联专家真诚无私的帮助，那我们就要困难得多，就不会在短时期内获得这样大的成就。
    拿工业来说吧。苏联专家们教给了我们很多先进的技术操作方法和生产管理方法，使我国工业设备的潜在能力得到很大的发挥，使我们的许多工厂，没有增加设备，而生产迅速地恢复并超过了历史上的最高水平。在短短的三年内，鞍钢的高炉利用系数已超过伪满时期百分之七十二，平炉利用系数则超过伪满时期百分之三十九。东北机器第三厂过去每季只能生产五十台机器，现在每月就可以生产一百台。这些重大的成绩，就是在他们的帮助之下得到的。我们的煤矿，由于实行苏联专家所建议的新采煤法，回采率已由过去的百分之三十提高到百分之八十，这就等于替我们国家增加了大量的煤矿资源。苏联专家们又给我国的煤矿制订了改建计划，使许多本来要废弃的矿井，能够延长二十年到四十年的寿命，这就等于给我们国家增加了许多新矿井。根据专家们的建议，我国的发电厂实行了定期检修的制度，以前作为备用的机器，现在不需要备用了，以前认为不可能达到铭牌出力的机器，现在能达到了，以前认为应当报废的超过三十年的旧机器，现在可以运转得像新机器一样了。他们帮助我们发现了许多新的石油矿藏，证明我国是一个石油蕴藏丰富的国家，改变了过去认为我国石油资源贫乏的错误概念。他们为我国设计了许多最新式的工厂和矿井，其中有一部分已在他们亲手帮助之下，安装了机器、开始了生产。他们看到我国木材缺少和纸浆设备不足的困难，就研究并试制成功了稻草半料浆造纸法，以便用稻草造纸，为我国造纸工业开辟了新的前途。
    在农业、林业和水利工作方面，苏联农业专家在农作制度和耕作方法上给了我们很大的帮助。例如介绍了农作物密植的技术，大大提高了作物产量，以前我国每亩棉花只种一千五百株到二千五百株，现在则种三千株至四千株，结果凡采用了棉花密植技术的棉田，每亩棉花产量即增加百分之五十到百分之一百；凡采用小麦密植法的麦田，其产量即增加一倍以上。畜牧兽医专家给我们介绍了牲畜饲养管理、病畜隔离和病畜治疗的新技术之后，就基本上消灭了我国的牛瘟，并使一九五一年曾在九个省内流行很广的口蹄疫停止了蔓延。林业专家建议了先进的木材采伐方法，将伐根由七十公分降低到二十公分以下，增加了森林的利用率。水利专家帮助我们正确地认识了水的作用，纠正了我们干部中单纯泄水的思想，并在干部中树立了“水是人民的财富，必须储蓄水和利用水”的思想，把治水工作由消极除害变为除害和兴利相结合的工作。我们的治淮工程、荆江分洪工程和其他许多水利工程，其重大的技术问题，也都是由苏联专家帮助我们解决的。
    在交通、运输工作方面，首先应该指出苏联专家们帮助我们抢修铁路的功绩。一九四九年当国民党匪军节节败退的时候，全国铁路遭受到空前未有的大破坏，那时候能够完全通车的线路是不多的。在专家们热诚帮助之下，全国的铁路以神奇的速度一条一条地都修复了，这对于加速全国的解放和国民经济的恢复是起了重大作用的。已有五十余年历史并超过保险期达三十余年的京汉铁路黄河大铁桥，由英美资产阶级技术观点看来，是早已达到报废的程度了，但在苏联专家的建议和帮助下，我们进行了五次加固工程，现在它已变成一座崭新的铁桥了。内河运输实行了专家们所建议的一列式拖运法，将每个马力的拖运能力由三吨提高到十四吨。在公路建设中，专家们帮助我们制定了公路工程标准，提高了运输效能并节省材料达百分之二十以上。专家们仅仅对华南一条公路路线设计加以审查改订，就使我们国家节省了一千亿元。
    在财政金融方面专家们帮助我们初步学习了如何抓紧收入，如何节约支出，并初步地帮助我们建立起企业财务管理的制度，帮助我们建立起银行划拨清算等办法。
    在贸易和合作方面，苏联专家们一再指出要我们很好地研究居民需要，要加速资金周转，要减低流通费，并在这方面教给了我们许多先进的经营管理方法。
    在计划和统计工作方面，由于苏联专家们的帮助，我们已经建立了计划工作和统计工作的必要的制度，并开始学习了编制年度计划和五年计划的方法，这是今年我们开始实行五年计划必需具备的条件之一。
    在基本建设工作方面，苏联专家们在地质勘测、设计、施工和安装中帮助我们做了很多工作，帮助我们建立了必要的章则和制度，并在实际工作中帮助我们解决了许多复杂的技术问题，使规模巨大的建设工作有了良好的开端。
    苏联专家对于我国的文教建设，例如我国学制的改革，教学计划的改订，教材、教学方法、教学组织的改进，人民医疗卫生事业和电影、广播事业的发展都给了我们以巨大的帮助。特别是在高等教育的改革方面，由于苏联专家的具体帮助，我们采取了苏联的经验，将高等学校分为综合大学、专门学院和专科学校，由此进行了全面的院系调整工作，并根据国家建设对各项人才的需要，设置了各种专业，逐步地应用了苏联的教材；同时苏联专家又热诚地帮助我们培养大批的新的师资，建立教研组和课堂讨论的工作，这样我国的高等教育就逐渐改变了面貌，更加适应于国家的需要了。
    在政治和法律工作方面，在苏联专家们的帮助下，我们制定了劳动法等重要法规，他们并有系统地介绍了苏联的法制理论和苏联在立法、司法、检察和少数民族等工作方面的先进经验，大大提高了我们政治法律干部的业务水平。
    除了以上所说的各个方面以外，其他部门的苏联专家三年来都同样地帮助我们完成了很多的工作，给了我们很多卓越的贡献，这里不再一一列举了。
    苏联专家的先进技术和中国人民群众的积极性结合起来之后，已经在中国经济生活中产生了历史上梦想不到的这样多的奇迹，这难道不是证明斯大林同志所说苏联的帮助在技术上是“精湛的”，“头等的”么。
    不仅如此，他们对于帮助我国的工作是真心诚意的，忠心耿耿的。他们经常要我们的干部以最大的责任心对待自己的工作；要我们的干部节省国家的每一文钱，遇见我们的器材因保管不善而弃置满地时，总是向我们提出同志的批评和建议；遇见我们向苏联订购我国能自己制造的设备时，则总是提出应自己制造，不要浪费外汇；他们到工厂帮助工作时候，总是要我们的干部关心职工的生活和安全，常常说人是国家最宝贵的资产。而他们自己则在工作中表现着崇高的自我牺牲精神。如一位专家在工地由于疲劳过度，眼病复发，病情是很严重的，但他拒绝一切劝告，不愿休息。医生说，如果不休息，就要有失明的危险，他仍然不愿离开工作。最后只得把他在工地住的房子的门窗都用黑幕遮起来，禁止他用眼工作。就在这个房子里，他眼上蒙着厚厚的纱布，但仍然不断地提供了许多宝贵的意见。另一位专家在水泥工厂帮助推行新操作法时，为了检查工人的操作效果，曾不顾危险，爬上很高的、温度在一百度以上的烟筒，检查温度的调整情况。为了提高工人的操作技术水平，他经常冒着大窑的高温，在窑头工作八个小时，亲眼观察工人的操作情形。在执行某一技术任务时，他曾钻到充满灰尘的大窑里指导安装，一连工作了三十多小时，当别人劝他休息时，他不肯休息，反而要别人去轮流休息。由于工作劳累，他曾病了几次，但在病中，他每天还往现场打两三次电话，询问工作进展情况，并对于困难的问题提出解决的办法。这些例子是举不胜举的，差不多所有的专家都是用这样的精神工作着。我国职工、技术人员只要是和他们接触过的，都由于他们的崇高的精神而受到极大的感动和真正的教育。中国的广大职工们尊敬他们，热爱他们，把他们看成自己最亲爱的弟兄，看成自己应当学习的榜样。
    我们的五年建设计划方才开始。我们应当向苏联学习的东西还多得很。我们正在贯彻执行毛泽东主席的号召：“要学习苏联。我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”这对于我们胜利完成第一个五年计划是有决定意义的。我们正在克服这个学习中的一切障碍和困难，克服有些人员所存在的保守思想和懒惰思想，效法苏联人民的革命精神和实事求是的态度，积极学习苏联建国三十多年以来所积累的无限丰富和无限宝贵的经验以建设我们的国家。
    我们不仅要学习苏联人民的建国经验和他们的先进技术，我们更要学习他们的伟大的国际主义精神。我们的干部要效法苏联专家们的榜样，随时准备用自己的全部才能，以建设我们的祖国，壮大以苏联为首的伟大的和平民主与社会主义阵营的力量，保卫世界和平，加速全世界劳动人民解放斗争的最后胜利。
    中苏两国人民永久的友好同盟万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民最敬爱的朋友和导师斯大林同志万岁！
