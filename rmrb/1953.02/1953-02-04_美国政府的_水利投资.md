    The U.S. Government's "Water Conservancy Investment"
    Li Gao

    There's a story about a robber who robs a person, takes all his wealth, beats him black and blue, then takes a plaster from the loot and sticks it on the robbed person's temple, and then boasts to him: "I gave you this most precious panacea, it will make you immune to all diseases and live forever, how should you thank me!"

    The U.S. government uses this kind of robber's trick on the American people.

    Please take a look at this piece of boasting from the outgoing Truman administration in its final "State of the Union Address": "Over the past eight years, we have invested nearly $5 million in public funds in our rivers – investing in plans for flood control, irrigating fields, and producing cheap electricity, which is supplied to housewives, farmers, and businessmen who need electricity. We are very careful to protect the people's property – land, forests, oil and mines..."

    According to statistics, the taxes levied by the U.S. government during Truman's seven years in office were $86 billion more than the total taxes levied in the previous 156 years of American history. The U.S. government's expenditure in the past eight years, formally included in the budget, exceeded $499.9 billion. The "nearly $5 million" water conservancy investment that Truman boasted about is only one ten-thousandth of the total expenditure. According to American newspapers, the recent price of a U.S. medium bomber is $2.5 million. This means that the U.S. government's water conservancy investment in eight years is not even enough for the price of two medium bombers; while the U.S. lost more than 7,000 aircraft in the two years of the war of aggression against Korea.

    Using this paltry amount of money to run water conservancy projects in the United States, such a wasteful country, what can be accomplished? Naturally, even the existing water conservancy facilities cannot be maintained, so the United States has suffered continuous and severe floods in recent years. In July 1951, the Midwestern states of the United States experienced the most severe flood since 1903, inundating 1.5 million acres of land (equivalent to more than 9 million Chinese mu), causing property losses of more than $1 billion, and rendering 500,000 people homeless. Despite the severity of the disaster, the U.S. government was still busy spending tens of billions of dollars to buy military supplies. No one cared about repairing rivers, building dams, flood prevention, and drought control. Therefore, nine months later, in April 1952, the same area experienced a second major flood, inundating another 1.25 million acres (equivalent to more than 7 million Chinese mu) of land. In the Missouri area, 50 cities were flooded, and more than 100,000 refugees were displaced.

    These are the good deeds done by the U.S. government, which boasts of "paying great attention to protecting the people's property."

### 美国政府的“水利投资”

    美国政府的“水利投资”
    李高
    有过这样一个故事：一个强盗劫了人，抢光了他的财物，打得他遍体鳞伤之后，却从赃物里拿出一张膏药来贴在被劫者的太阳穴上，然后对他大吹起来：“我把这样最贵重的灵丹妙药给了你，它会叫你百病不生，长生不老，你该怎么感激我啊！”
    美国政府对待美国人民使用的就是这种强盗手段。
    请大家看看刚下台的杜鲁门政府在最后一次“国情咨文”中的这一段吹牛的话：“过去八年中我们对于我们的河道投下了将近五百万元的公款——投资于有关控制洪水、灌溉田畴、生产廉价电力的计划上，这种电力是供给需要用电的家庭妇女、农民和商人使用的。我们非常注意保卫人民的财产——土地、森林、石油和矿山……”
    据统计，在杜鲁门当政的七年中美国政府所征赋税，比以前美国历史上的一百五十六年中所征赋税总额还多八百六十亿美元。美国政府在过去八年中的开支，正式列入预算的就有四千九百九十亿美元以上。杜鲁门所吹的“将近五百万元”水利投资，仅仅是总开支的十万分之一。据美国报纸报道，美国一架中型轰炸机最近的价格是二百五十万美元。这就是说，美国政府八年中的水利投资，还不够两架中型轰炸机的价格；而美国在侵朝战争的两年中损失的飞机就有七千多架。
    八年中用这点点可怜的钱来办水利事业，在美国那样浪费的国家，能办什么事呢？自然是连原有的水利设施也维护不了，所以，美国近年来连续不断地发生严重的水灾。一九五一年七月，美国中西部诸州发生了一九○三年以来最严重的一次水灾，淹没了土地一百五十万英亩（合中国亩九百多万亩），损失财物十亿美元以上，使五十万人无家可归。尽管灾情这样重，但美国政府还是忙着拿几百亿美元去买军火，至于修河、筑坝、防洪、防旱这些事是没有人管的。所以，九个月后，一九五二年四月，同一地区又出现了第二次大水灾，又淹没了一百二十五万英亩（合中国亩七百多万亩）土地。在密苏里区域，被淹没的城市就有五十座，流离失所的难民达十多万人。
    这些，就是那个自吹为“非常注意保卫人民财产”的美国政府所干的好事。
