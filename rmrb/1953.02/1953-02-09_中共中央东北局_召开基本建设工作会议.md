    Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
    Convenes Basic Construction Work Conference

    [This News Report] The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a basic construction work conference from January 15th to 19th to mobilize the entire party in the Northeast to welcome the first year of the nation's First Five-Year Plan. Zhang Mingyuan, Third Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, delivered a report at the meeting, systematically summarizing the experiences of basic construction in 1952 and outlining the central tasks for 1953.

    The main experiences of the Northeast in leading basic construction in 1952 were: First, a transformation in understanding and ideological mobilization was carried out. Based on the new situation of economic development in the Northeast, the Northeast Bureau promptly decided that the Party's leadership over state-owned industries must prioritize basic construction. In the process of implementation, it promptly criticized conservative and departmentalism thinking stemming from insufficient understanding of the new economic development and the Northeast Bureau's policies; reckless advancement stemming from insufficient understanding of the complexity of basic construction; and localism and egalitarianism stemming from insufficient understanding of the priorities of basic construction. Experience has proven that after a new policy is determined, it must undergo a process of understanding to truly and effectively become the practical action of all cadres and workers. During this process, the Party must constantly criticize various resistant ideologies. Second, the forces of basic construction were gathered and strengthened. While carrying out ideological mobilization, a series of organizational measures were also taken. Cadres, technicians, and workers were rapidly gathered by transferring them from production departments (this was the main method) and squeezing them out from other areas. Various specialized or comprehensive construction companies were established, and political, professional, and technical training was conducted to cultivate workers in specialized trades. Experience has proven that in the process of gathering forces, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the important significance of strengthening basic construction, refute fears of production collapse and departmentalism thinking, and constantly criticize cadres' fear of difficulties and hardships. Third, several laws of basic construction were initially understood. It was recognized that basic construction must strictly abide by the procedures of surveying, design, construction, and acceptance; it was recognized the importance of design work in the entire basic construction process and that the Party must strengthen its leadership over design departments; it was recognized the complexity of major projects, that the organization and planning of construction must be strengthened, and that thorough preparatory work must be done; it was recognized the many characteristics of basic construction, such as: design must adopt advanced standards, the state requires speed, but the workforce is new, there is a lot of manual labor, high turnover, and the technical thinking and skills of many technicians are outdated, so political work must be strengthened, Soviet advanced technology must be emphasized, and these contradictions must be overcome by continuously improving the political and technical level of employees. Fourth, a mass responsibility system movement was launched, which was the primary link in transforming the newly organized teams into combat-effective teams. It is necessary to conduct in-depth education, mobilize the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, review and expose losses and waste at all levels, and commend the advanced. While mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to implement democratic management and improve workers' living and welfare; then, on the basis of mass mobilization, establish various responsibility systems. Fifth, implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and vigorously promoting advanced experiences are key issues in doing a good job in basic construction, which leading cadres must pay close attention to. Sixth, strengthen political work. Political work organizations were established, class education and democratic education were carried out, a necessary after-work study system was established during the construction period, and the method of combining political work and economic work was used to ensure the timely completion of central tasks. The main shortcomings of basic construction in the Northeast in 1952 were that preparation work was not done well enough and the economic accounting system was poorly implemented. This showed that the leading ideology was not comprehensive enough, paying attention to "good, fast," but neglecting "economical," paying attention to construction, but relaxing surveying and design.

    In 1953, the construction tasks in the Northeast increased by 84 percent compared to last year, of which new construction projects accounted for 64 percent, and the complexity of the projects greatly increased. The completion of this year's tasks has a great impact on the country's industrialization. According to this requirement, the following six tasks must be focused on:

    First, Party committees at all levels and all relevant departments must further strengthen their leadership over basic construction, must implement the Central Committee's policy of focusing on heavy industry, and concentrate their efforts to ensure the completion of heavy industry projects that are decisive for the fate of the country, especially ensuring the completion of key projects first. Continue to oppose egalitarianism, conservatism, and departmentalism thinking. Whether it is industrial and agricultural production, urban construction, transportation, trade cooperation, culture, or health, all must directly and indirectly support and cooperate with basic construction from different positions; we must continue to strengthen the forces of basic construction, and pay special attention to continuing to improve the political, technical, and professional level of the teams that were gathered last year and those that are newly gathered this year. At the same time, we must also rationally organize the labor force, fully tap its potential, and improve labor productivity; we must continue to establish and improve various business organizations, especially design and equipment management departments should be further strengthened. Specialized or comprehensive construction companies should also be strengthened, continue to consolidate, merge, and concentrate the scattered forces, and continuously cultivate reserve forces, especially to plan for the training of workers in specialized trades.

    Second, strictly abide by the construction procedures, strengthen design work, and do a good job in construction preparation. Basic construction is a scientific and rigorous work, and must be carried out in accordance with objective laws, so it is necessary to be good at mastering the laws of basic construction, strictly abide by the prescribed construction procedures, and pay attention to mastering the key issues in each procedure. As for surveying and design work, our strength is currently very weak, political leadership is poor, and the technical level is low, so the first thing to do is to strengthen the organization, strengthen the Party's leadership over the design department, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and gradually transform the bourgeois ideology of the technical personnel. Design departments should strengthen the study of Soviet experience, and strengthen the planned management of design, and first ensure the completion of the design of key projects. In order to ensure the quality of design, it is necessary to establish a technical responsibility system and a design review system, and strengthen the collection of original data; designers should take the initiative to solicit opinions from users or Party A to improve their work. Doing a good job in construction preparation is an even more important task at present (especially for units with complex projects). To this end, the winter training plan must first be completed on time, and winter training must be combined with summarizing experience. Second, continue to focus on inspecting the preparation work for construction, and check the preparation of designs, materials, and equipment. The auxiliary factories and mechanized equipment for key projects must be prepared, and the on-site preparation work before construction must be done better, and the site should be surveyed. A construction organization design should be made, transportation roads and auxiliary equipment should be arranged as early as possible, and the manpower, lighting electricity, and project water should be accurately calculated. In addition, attention should also be paid to doing a good job in urban planning.

    Third, implement the comprehensive view of "good, fast, and economical" and comprehensively complete the national plan. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen plan management. First, it is necessary to formulate correct and reasonable progress plans, specifically stipulating the project progress for each quarter, month, and ten-day period; and based on this, formulate a series of specific measures plans - technical organization measures, material supply, mechanical tool supply, etc.; and then organize construction according to the instruction charts. The project plan must be handed over to the masses for discussion, and collective contracts and linked contracts should be promoted and competitions should be organized where conditions permit. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen on-site dispatching work, establish dispatching organizations, and promote the dispatcher system. Second, it is necessary to strengthen technical management. Education on ensuring quality should be conducted among employees, a series of technical responsibility systems should be established, quality standards and operating procedures for each type of work should be formulated, and an independent inspection system should be established. In order to ensure the quality of key projects, strong technical personnel should be assigned here, and the supply of materials should also first ensure the needs of key projects. A mass inspection system should be established among workers, and a system for studying drawings and engineering models should be established. Third, it is necessary to implement the economic accounting system, strengthen financial management and financial supervision, oppose the supply system ideology, and implement enterprise-like management; in places where waste is serious, mass anti-waste and economy movements should be launched. In order to strengthen financial management and financial supervision, it is necessary to formulate financial plans, stipulate specific indicators, adhere to the dedicated use of special funds, allocate funds according to plan, and strictly abide by financial discipline. Material management should be strengthened, and a storage and recycling system should be established. The material department should cooperate with the design department to formulate supply plans. The contract system should be promoted and adhered to, and construction companies should gradually achieve contracting for both labor and materials. Quota management should be implemented, and the existing quotas are not accurate enough and must be reviewed and revised. Finally, it is necessary to gradually develop towards factoryization and mechanization. For projects where conditions permit, mechanization indicators should be formulated, auxiliary factories should be installed in a planned way, tools should be added, specialized management organizations should be established, technical workers should be trained, and operating procedures and use and storage systems should be formulated to give full play to the effectiveness of mechanized tools and improve labor productivity.

    Fourth, mobilize the masses to widely promote advanced experience and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Learning advanced Soviet technology and promoting advanced experience are the most fundamental and effective ways to complete the basic construction plan. Therefore, in the basic construction sector, from cadres to workers, a trend of learning from the Soviet Union should be created, resolutely opposing conservative thinking and opposing outdated and backward technology. Various units should take necessary organizational measures, establish specialized organizations to lead this work, and establish technical research organizations, focusing on promoting key advanced experiences. In the promotion work, the Party's political work should take measures from the ideological and propaganda and mobilization work to break conservative thinking, and can use exhibitions, after-work schools, and other methods to promote it. The suggestions of Soviet experts must be resolutely implemented. For Communist Party members, this should become a Party discipline, and absolutely no perfunctory attitude is allowed. In order to ensure the promotion of advanced experience, units where conditions permit should implement piece-rate wages and promote a progressive piece-rate wage system and a reward system.

    Fifth, implement the policy of safe production and do a good job in workers' welfare. In terms of security work, we should focus on solving key problems, such as high-altitude operations, fire prevention, etc., and also pay attention to technical security. In order to do a good job in workers' living and welfare, basic construction departments must do a good job in workers' food, accommodation, transportation, medical care, living supplies, cultural entertainment, and other work.

    Sixth, strengthen political work. This year, the basic construction tasks in the Northeast are even more important and arduous, and the Party must guarantee the completion of this task by strengthening political work. We must further establish and improve political work organizations, reduce levels, and bring them closer to the grassroots. Comprehensive or specialized engineering companies should set up political offices, and engineering teams in construction sites and large construction sites should set up political instructors. The central task of political work in the basic construction sector is to ensure and supervise the completion of basic construction tasks by continuously improving the political consciousness and professional and technical level of employees, while continuously opposing bureaucratism and ideas and styles that violate policies. This is the method of combining political work and economic work. During the winter training period, Party organizations in various basic construction departments should pay attention to developing a group of Party members, and lead the Communist Youth League and trade unions to develop their own organizations. It is necessary to carry out systematic ideological education work among the masses, and take different methods according to the different characteristics of different objects. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the mass work of the basic construction department, strengthen the Party's leadership over the basic construction, and create a typical example similar to the May 3rd Factory in the basic construction department.

    After Comrade Zhang Mingyuan's report, Wang Yuqing, Deputy General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and others introduced their various experiences in leading basic construction. Finally, Lin Feng, Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, made a summary report at the meeting.

    中共中央东北局
    召开基本建设工作会议
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局于一月十五日至十九日召开基本建设工作会议，动员东北全党迎接国家第一个五年计划的第一年。东北局第三副书记张明远在会上作报告，系统地总结了一九五二年基本建设的经验，提出了一九五三年的中心任务。
    一九五二年东北领导基本建设的主要经验是：一、进行了认识上的转变和思想上的动员。根据东北经济发展的新情况，东北局及时地决定了党对国营工业的领导必须把基本建设提到首要地位，并在贯彻过程中及时批判了由于对经济发展新情况以及对东北局方针认识不足而产生的保守、本位主义思想，由于对基本建设的复杂性认识不足而产生的贪多冒进思想，以及由于对基本建设的重点认识不足而产生的局部观念和平均主义思想。经验证明：新的方针确定之后，真正切实变成全体干部和职工的实际行动，要经过一个认识过程，在这个过程中，党对各种抵抗思想必须随时批判。二、集结和壮大了基本建设力量。进行思想动员的同时，在组织上也采取了一系列措施，采取从生产部门调（这是主要的）和从其他方面挤的办法，迅速集结了干部、技术人员和工人，建立了各种专业的或综合性的工程公司，并进行了政治、业务、技术的训练，培养了特殊工种的工人。经验证明，在集结力量的过程中必须反复说明加强基本建设的重要意义，批驳怕生产垮台及本位主义思想，并在干部中随时批判怕困难、怕吃苦的思想。三、初步认识了基本建设的若干规律。认识了基本建设必须严格遵守勘察、设计、施工、验收的程序；认识了设计工作在整个基本建设当中的重要性，党必须加强对设计部门的领导；认识了重大工程的复杂性，必须加强施工的组织性计划性，充分做好准备工作；认识了基本建设的许多特点，如：设计要采取先进标准，国家要求要快，但工人的队伍是新的，手工作业多，流动性大，许多技术人员的技术思想和技术是陈旧的，因此必须加强政治工作、强调学习苏联的先进技术，用不断提高职工政治水平和技术水平的方法，来克服这些矛盾。四、开展群众性的责任制运动，这是把新组织的队伍变成有战斗力的队伍的首要一环。必须深入教育、发动群众，开展批评与自我批评，层层检讨、揭发损失浪费，同时表扬先进。发动群众的同时，要实行管理民主化，改进工人生活福利；然后在群众发动了的基础上建立各种责任制。五、贯彻苏联专家建议，大力推广先进经验是搞好基本建设的关键问题，领导干部必须十分重视。六、加强政治工作。建立了政治工作机构，进行了阶级教育和民主教育，建立了施工时期必要的业余学习制度，运用政治工作和经济工作结合的办法及时保证了中心任务的完成。一九五二年东北基本建设的主要缺点是准备工作做得不够，经济核算制贯彻得很差。这就表现了领导思想还不够全面，注意了“好、快”，忽视了“省”，注意了施工，放松了勘察、设计。
    一九五三年东北的建设任务比去年增加了百分之八十四，其中新建工程占百分之六十四，工程的复杂性大大增加。今年任务的完成对国家工业化关系很大。根据这一要求，要着重做好以下六项工作：
    一、各级党委及各主管部门必须进一步加强对基本建设的领导，必须贯彻中央以重工业为重点的方针，集中力量保证对国家命运有决定意义的重工业工程的完成，特别是首先要保证重点工程的完成。继续反对平均主义、保守主义、本位主义的思想。无论是工农业生产、城市建设、运输、贸易合作、文化卫生，全要从不同的岗位上直接间接地支援、配合基本建设；必须继续壮大基本建设力量，特别要注意继续提高去年已集结的和今年新集结的队伍的政治、技术、业务水平，同时也要合理地组织劳动力，充分发挥潜力，提高劳动生产率；必须继续建立和健全各种业务机构，特别是设计和设备管理部门更要进一步充实。各专门性的或综合性的工程公司也要加强，继续把分散的力量整理、合并、集中起来，并不断培养后备力量，特别是要有计划地培养特殊工种工人。
    二、严格遵守建设程序，加强设计工作，做好施工准备工作。基本建设是一项科学的、严密的工作，必须要按照客观规律来进行，因此要善于掌握基本建设的规律，严格遵守规定的建设程序，并注意掌握每个程序中的关键问题。至于勘察设计工作，目前我们的力量很薄弱，政治领导差，技术水平低，因此首先就要充实机构，加强党对设计部门的领导，加强政治思想领导，对技术人员的资产阶级思想要逐步改造。设计部门要加强对苏联经验的学习，和加强设计的计划管理，首先保证重点工程设计的完成。为了保证设计质量，要建立技术责任制和设计审查制度，加强原始资料的搜集工作；设计人员要主动征求用户或甲方的意见，以改进自己的工作。做好施工准备工作更是当前的重要任务（特别是工程复杂的单位）。为此，首先要按时完成冬训计划，冬训一定要和总结经验相结合。其次要继续抓紧对施工准备工作的检查，检查设计、材料、设备的准备。重点工程的附属工厂和机械化设备要准备好，施工前现场的准备工作更要做好，现场应进行勘测。要做出施工组织设计，运输道路、附属设备要及早安排，同时应精确计算人工、照明用电以及工程用水。此外，也要注意做好城市的规划工作。
    三、贯彻“好、快、省”的全面观点，全面地完成国家计划。为此，就需要加强计划管理。首先要订出正确、合理的进度计划，具体规定出每季每月每旬的工程进度；并据此订出一系列的具体措施计划——技术组织措施、材料供应、机械工具供应等计划；然后按照指示图表组织施工。工程计划一定要交给群众讨论，有条件的地方要推行集体合同和联系合同、组织竞赛。同时要加强现场的调度工作，建立调度机构，推行调度员制度。其次，要加强技术管理。在职工中要进行保证质量的教育，建立一系列的技术责任制，订出质量标准和各工种的操作规程，建立独立的检验制度。为了保证关键工程的质量，要把强的技术人员配备到这里，材料供应也首先要保证关键工程的需要。在工人当中要建立群众性的检查制度，建立研究图纸和工程模型的制度。再次，就是要贯彻经济核算制，加强财务管理和财政监督，反对供给制思想，实行经营企业化；在浪费严重的地方要开展群众性的反浪费和节约运动。为了加强财务管理和财政监督，必须订出财务计划，规定具体指标，坚持专款专用，按计划拨款，严格遵守财政纪律。要加强材料管理，建立保管、回收制度。材料部门应与设计部门配合，订出供应计划。要推行并坚持合同制，工程公司要逐步做到包工包料。要实行定额管理，已有的定额不够准确，必须审查修订。最后，并要逐渐向工厂化、机械化方向发展，凡有条件的工程，要订出机械化的指标，有计划地安设附属工厂，增设工具，成立专管机构，培养技术工人，订出操作规程和使用保管制度，以发挥机械化工具的效能，提高劳动生产率。
    四、发动群众普遍推广先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议。学习苏联先进技术，推广先进经验，是完成基本建设计划最根本的有效办法，因此在基本建设部门，从干部到工人要造成学习苏联的风气，坚决反对保守思想，反对陈旧落后的技术。各单位在组织上要采取必要的措施，成立专门领导这一工作的机构，建立技术研究组织，着重推广关键性的先进经验。在推广工作中，党的政治工作要从思想上、宣传鼓动工作上采取措施，打破保守思想，并可运用展览会、业余学校等办法加以推广。苏联专家的建议必须坚决贯彻，对共产党员来讲，应该成为一条党的纪律，绝对不许采取敷衍的态度。为了保证先进经验的推广，有条件的单位要实行计件工资，推行累进计件工资制度和奖励制度。
    五、贯彻安全生产的方针，搞好职工福利工作。在保安工作方面，应着重解决关键问题，如高空作业、防火等，同时也要注意技术上的保安。为搞好职工生活福利工作，各基本建设部门必须搞好职工的食宿、交通、医疗、生活供应、文化娱乐等工作。
    六、加强政治工作。今年东北的基本建设任务更加重大、艰巨，党必须从加强政治工作方面来保证这一任务的完成。必须进一步建立和健全政治工作机构，减少层次，使之更接近基层。综合性的或专业的工程公司要设政治处，工地和大工地的工程队要设政治指导员。基本建设部门政治工作的中心任务是用不断提高职工政治觉悟和业务、技术水平的方法，同时要不断地反对官僚主义以及违反政策等思想、作风，来保证与监督基本建设任务的完成。这也就是政治工作和经济工作相结合的方法。各基本建设部门的党组织，在冬训期间应注意发展
    一批党员，并领导青年团、工会发展自己的组织。在群众中要进行系统的思想教育工作，根据不同对象的不同特点，要采取不同的方法。同时要加强基本建设部门的群众工作，加强党对基本建设的领导，在基本建设部门创造类似五三工厂的典型。
    在张明远同志报告之后，鞍山钢铁公司副总经理王玉清等介绍了他们领导基本建设的各种经验。最后东北局副书记林枫在会上作了总结报告。
