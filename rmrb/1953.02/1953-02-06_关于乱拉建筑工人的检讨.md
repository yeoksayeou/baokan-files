    Self-Criticism Regarding the Irregular Recruitment of Construction Workers
    Zhao Pin'san, Factory Director of Factory 45333

    After the People's Daily criticized our illegal and undisciplined behavior in recruiting construction workers, we immediately organized an inspection team and, under the guidance of the Fourth Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, conducted an inspection. The inspection results proved that the Party newspaper's criticism of us was entirely consistent with the facts. We sincerely accept the Party newspaper's criticism. The main circumstances of our illegal and undisciplined behavior are explained as follows:

    From December 5th to December 26th last year, we recruited a total of 464 workers, including 134 from the Beijing Construction Company. Regarding recruitment procedures, in addition to the workers from the Beijing Construction Company, 188 did not have letters of introduction or completion certificates. In Dacheng County, Hebei Province, 59 people were recruited without the permission of the local government.

    Many of the workers we recruited in the Nan Yuan area of Beijing did not have letters of introduction or completion certificates. We clearly knew they were workers from the Beijing Construction Company, but Bi Min actually instructed them to go to the district government or the Municipal Labor Bureau to obtain letters of introduction in order to cope with the situation. Although we raised the issue at the Party committee meeting of not poaching from the Beijing Construction Company, we only considered it from the perspective of not damaging our usually good relationship with the company's construction site, and did not recognize that this was a matter of policy and discipline. Therefore, we once decided that after the company's construction site was completed, we could recruit their unused temporary workers.

    Bi Min, Deputy Section Chief of the Capital Construction Section, once suggested that "wages cannot be increased, can we take care of them in terms of welfare?" Although I did not agree, I did not realize that this was a way to attract workers with material incentives, and did not give it strict criticism. In addition, Bi Min's liberalism led to random talk and rumors spreading among the workers, causing emotional fluctuations among the workers of the Beijing Construction Company.

    When the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau sent people to our factory for inspection, Bi Min adopted a rude and unreasonable attitude of resistance and hinted to the workers to make trouble for the comrades from the Labor Bureau. Afterwards, when Bi Min reported the Labor Bureau comrades' intentions to me, I only replied that the workers should be returned to the Beijing Construction Company, but I did not take resolute measures to strictly criticize Bi Min's rude attitude towards government work comrades.

    This incident exposed our serious task-oriented viewpoint, our weak policy viewpoint, and our insufficient policy education and ideological education for cadres. What is particularly serious is that under the control of this disorganized and undisciplined erroneous thinking, we were numb and accommodating to the erroneous phenomena that had occurred, and failed to check and correct them in time during the implementation process.

    We thank the Party newspaper and the higher authorities for their help. We guarantee to examine our work politically and ideologically and correct our mistakes. We will further investigate violations of laws and regulations in our factory, launch policy education among cadres, and thoroughly correct the "specialization" thinking that still exists among the management cadres of our factory.

    关于乱拉建筑工人的检讨
    四五三三三厂厂长  赵品三
    人民日报批评我们在招收建筑工人中的违法乱纪行为以后，我们马上组织检查组，在中央第二机械工业部第四局调查组的指导下进行检查。检查结果，证明党报对我们的批评完全符合事实。我们诚恳地接受党报的批评。现将我们违法乱纪的主要情况说明如下：
    从去年十二月五日至十二月二十六日，我们共招收了四百六十四名工人，其中有北京市建筑公司的一百三十四名。在招收手续上，除北京市建筑公司的工人外，尚有一百八十八名无介绍信及完工证。仅在河北省大城县未经地方政府允许招收的就有五十九名。
    我们在北京南苑地区招收的工人，许多都没有介绍信和完工证。我们明知是北京市建筑公司的工人，但毕敏竟指使他们去区政府或市劳动局要介绍信，以兹应付。我们在党委会上虽提出不要挖北京市建筑公司的墙角，但我们只从不要损害我们与该公司工地一向很好的关系出发，而没有认识到这是政策纪律的问题。因此我们曾决定在该公司工地完工后可以招收他们不用的临时工。
    基本建设科副科长毕敏曾提出“工资不能提高，可否从福利上照顾”的意见，我虽没有同意，但没有认识到这是一种以物质引诱工人的作法，没有给以严格的批判。加以毕敏自由主义地乱说、乱谈，各种各样的流言便在工人中传播开来，引起北京市建筑公司工人的情绪波动起来。
    北京市劳动局派人来我厂检查时，毕敏竟采取蛮横不讲理的抗拒态度，并示意工人去找劳动局同志的麻烦。事后毕敏将劳动局同志来意向我报告时，我只答称应该把工人退还给北京市建筑公司，但没有采取坚决的措施，对毕敏不尊重政府工作同志的蛮横态度给以严格批评。
    这件事暴露了我们存在着严重的单纯任务观点，政策观点非常薄弱，对干部的政策教育、思想教育做得很不够。尤其严重的是在此种无组织无纪律的错误思想的支配下，对于已发生的错误现象麻木迁就，未能在执行过程中及时检查、纠正。
    感谢党报和上级对我们的帮助，我们保证从政治上思想上来检查自己工作，改正错误。并进一步在我厂中检查违反法令的行为，在干部中展开政策教育，彻底纠正我厂管理干部中还存在着的“特殊化”的思想。
