    Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association
    Decides to Focus on Promoting Russian Language Learning Campaign
    The Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association held a regional conference for on-the-job cadres studying Russian in their spare time from February 5th to 7th. The conference summarized the experiences in organizing and promoting Russian language learning in the Northeast region over the past three years and laid out the guidelines and tasks for future work.
    According to incomplete statistics, over the past three years, the China-Soviet Friendship Associations in various parts of Northeast China have run 266 Russian language learning classes, with a total of more than 12,800 students (cumulative number). Currently, there are 157 Russian language classes that maintain regular study, with more than 4,000 students. In addition, 144 units have established Russian language night schools with the help of local China-Soviet Friendship Associations, with a total of 339 classes and more than 7,700 students. Students in these part-time Russian language schools generally make rapid progress.
    The conference pointed out in its summary that there are still shortcomings in Russian language learning in various places, such as not being standardized enough, and the teaching guidelines and tasks not being clear and specific enough. The conference proposed that the future guiding principle for part-time Russian language teaching is: to closely integrate with national economic construction and help on-the-job cadres achieve the ability to read Russian books in a preliminary and specific way within a certain period of time. Various Russian language learning organizations should mainly recruit technicians and professional cadres, appropriately take into account the requirements of general office cadres to learn Russian, strengthen ideological leadership in teaching, improve teaching materials, and adjust study time according to the principles of "learning for application" and "learning what you do" in order to improve the quality of teaching.

    东北中苏友好协会
    决定重点开展俄文学习运动
    东北中苏友好协会在二月五日到七日召开全区在职干部业余俄文学习专业会议，会议总结了东北地区三年来组织和推广俄文学习工作的经验，规定了今后工作的方针和任务。
    据不完全统计，三年来东北各地中苏友好协会已主办俄文学习班二百六十六期，学员达一万二千八百多人（累计数）。目前保持经常学习的俄文班，有一百五十七班，学员达四千多人。此外还有一百四十四个单位在各地中苏友好协会的帮助下成立了俄文夜校，共有三百三十九个班，学员七千七百多人。这些业余俄文学校的学员一般都进步很快。
    会议在总结中指出，各地俄文学习中还存在着不够正规、教学方针和任务不够明确具体等缺点。会议提出：今后业余俄文教学方针是：紧密地结合国家经济建设，帮助在职干部在一定时间内达到初步具体阅读俄文书籍的能力。各种俄文学习组织吸收学员应以技术人员和专业干部为主，适当地照顾一般机关干部学习俄文的要求，并加强教学思想领导，根据“学以致用”、“做什么学什么”的原则，改进教材，调整学习时间，以提高教学质量。
