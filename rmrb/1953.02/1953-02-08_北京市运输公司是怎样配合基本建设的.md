How the Beijing Transportation Company Cooperates with Basic Construction
Li Musheng

Doing a good job in transportation is an important link in completing the task of basic construction. Failure to adequately estimate this point will seriously affect the smooth progress of basic construction work. This is one of the important lessons from basic construction in Beijing in 1952.

In September 1952, Beijing universally started basic construction. However, the construction units did not sufficiently recognize the importance of transportation work in advance. Everything was prepared, except for considering the transportation problem. The Beijing Transportation Company also lacked foresight and did not have sufficient ideological and action preparation for the upcoming huge transportation tasks. By the end of September, the construction units generally started work, and the transportation tasks of construction materials suddenly increased, and vehicles were in short supply. However, the Beijing Transportation Company still used the old method of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts" in vehicle allocation, resulting in each construction site occupying a small number of vehicles, but none of them could solve the problem. By early October, the goods undertaken but not transported by the Beijing Transportation Company exceeded more than ten times the daily transportation volume of all its vehicles, and more than 700,000 tons of construction materials were backlogged for transportation (the backlog of coal, grain, and other living materials was not included in the statistics). This resulted in the serious phenomenon of construction units stopping work waiting for materials and starting work waiting for materials. For example, the construction of school buildings in many schools in Beijing was originally scheduled to start in mid-October. The workers had arrived at the construction site, but because the materials could not be transported, it was delayed until early November before officially starting work, which not only affected the progress of the project but also caused great waste.

Due to the shortage of transportation vehicles, private "scalpers" took the opportunity to raise freight rates. For example, the transportation company stipulated that the freight rate for transporting bricks from Majiapu to near Xuanwumen was 65 yuan per brick, but the private "scalpers" raised it to 95 yuan or even 110 yuan.

In response to these serious situations, the Beijing Transportation Company first suggested that under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, a joint transportation office should be formed by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Beijing Construction Company, the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, and the Beijing Transportation Company to jointly discuss and solve the transportation problem. The joint office, according to the construction progress and project nature of each construction unit, distinguished between the importance and urgency, and allocated transportation vehicles in a concentrated and focused manner. At the same time, inspection teams were organized to conduct key inspections at various construction sites, and appropriate vehicles were allocated to units with more serious work stoppages waiting for materials. In addition, 2,000 horse-drawn carts were mobilized from the suburbs of Beijing, and 118 automobiles and 500 horse-drawn carts were transferred from Qingdao, Jinan, Hebei, Tianjin, and other places to assist in rush transportation.

At the same time, the Beijing Transportation Company changed the past method of universally taking care of vehicle allocation and adopted the method of unified dispatch of all vehicles. The branches stopped soliciting transportation tasks on their own and changed to the city company's operations section to centrally undertake transportation tasks and uniformly allocate them. In order to complete the transportation tasks of basic construction materials and living materials, all vehicles of the branches were divided into fixed vehicles and mobile vehicles (long-distance buses and vehicles supplying living materials were used as fixed vehicles). According to the needs of each branch, a certain number of vehicles were stipulated to be controlled by each branch, and the rest were used as mobile vehicles, which were uniformly allocated by the city company to participate in the transportation of basic construction materials. To take care of the needs of piecemeal transportation, each branch left a small number of vehicles as mobile vehicles with the consent of the city company.

Without a strict system and scientific vehicle allocation method for the transportation of large-scale basic construction materials, not only is it difficult to avoid the waste of transportation capacity, but also the construction progress and progress will be seriously affected due to the failure of various building materials to arrive at the construction site in time. The Beijing Transportation Company lacked business statistics in the past. In this basic construction material transportation, it did not fully grasp the situation of each consignor unit and construction site. The consigning departments also lacked experience in this regard, so the two sides could not cooperate closely, and often there were phenomena such as small sites, many vehicles, untimely loading and unloading, or failure to ship goods when vehicles arrived. Therefore, in the initial period, the waste of transportation capacity was very serious. In order to improve this situation, in addition to mobilizing workers to improve vehicle transportation efficiency as much as possible and suggesting that relevant units improve the delivery work, the company also initially established the following systems:

1.  Consignment plan form: Before consignment, the shipper must fill in the consignment plan form, indicating the type, quantity, location, and required completion period of the goods. The transportation company can understand the material situation according to this form, so as to allocate transportation vehicles in a planned way.
2.  Vehicle allocation order: After the vehicle is allocated, the city company issues the vehicle allocation order to the cargo owner, who can use this order to allocate vehicles to each branch. This can avoid the waste of transportation capacity by each branch allocating vehicles at will.
3.  Unified reporting system: Each branch fills in the daily transportation volume and the storage volume of goods to be transported every day. According to this report, the city company can understand the completion of daily transportation and the storage volume of goods to be transported in each branch and the entire company, so as to allocate vehicles and assign tasks in a timely manner.
4.  Investigation map of construction site and delivery location: The company draws each department's delivery location and construction site into charts, and details the location, distance, on-site vehicle capacity, road conditions, etc., so as to grasp the detailed situation and appropriately allocate vehicles, and at the same time understand the construction nature of the construction site, so as to rank according to the severity and urgency.

Thanks to the Beijing Transportation Company's timely change from the initial passive and chaotic state, adopting the policy of grasping the key points and distinguishing between urgency, boldly improving the work methods, and striving for the strong support of relevant departments, in two months, the materials required for Beijing's 1952 basic construction were basically rushed to transport, and at the same time, the city's regular supply of living materials was also taken care of.

However, there are still many problems in the transportation of basic construction materials by the Beijing Transportation Company in 1952. For example, private vehicles do not yet have a unified management agency, nor a set of specific management methods. Only a part of private cars and horse-drawn carts (about four-fifths of private vehicles) are organized by the Beijing Transportation Company in the form of "mutual aid groups". Because the "mutual aid group" is established on a voluntary basis, and the transportation company cannot grasp all the sources of goods, it will often cause confusion in the transportation order when the freight is abnormal. In addition, the vehicle allocation is not scientific and flexible enough, the vehicle transportation efficiency has not been fully utilized, the waste of transportation capacity is still quite serious, and the transportation cost is still too high, etc. These are all in urgent need of improvement.

In order to more powerfully cooperate with the basic construction in 1953, the Beijing Transportation Company is requesting instructions from the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, preparing to organize a unified transportation management committee by relevant departments, unifying the source of goods, unifying freight rates, and carrying out necessary organization and management of private vehicles, so as to concentrate transportation forces and complete transportation tasks. In order to balance the strength of the fleet and facilitate centralized allocation, all vehicles are reorganized into teams, which can strengthen leadership and gradually achieve a single vehicle accounting system to reduce transportation costs. In addition, it is also preparing to implement special vehicle transportation to improve workers' labor efficiency and give full play to the potential of vehicles.

The scale of Beijing's basic construction in 1953 is even greater than last year. The "Joint Transportation Office" established last year under the leadership of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee was basically an emergency organizational form to adapt to large-scale blitz transportation. This organizational form can no longer meet the requirements of this year's more arduous transportation tasks. Therefore, after the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council announced the unified management of building materials, the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee cancelled the "Joint Transportation Office" composed of construction departments and transportation departments last year, and under the leadership of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the "Building Materials Supply Joint Office" was jointly organized by building material production departments and transportation departments. The institutions participating in this organization include the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the Beijing Building Materials Company, the Production Section of the Central Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, the Production Section of the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, the Beijing Cooperative, and the Beijing Transportation Company. The Building Materials Supply Joint Office is an organizational form that combines production, transportation, and sales. The construction department can uniformly solve the problem of equipment procurement and transportation in the joint office, simplifying procedures and saving manpower.

Due to the slow progress of the design work of Beijing's basic construction projects, most of the construction units have not yet started preparing materials, and the cross-year (1952) projects cannot be prepared for materials due to the failure to allocate funds, resulting in the abnormal phenomenon of excess transportation capacity. In early January, the average daily vehicle attendance rate of the Beijing Transportation Company was only about one-third. In order to improve this situation and strive to use all the remaining transportation capacity in the off-season to avoid the phenomenon of material backlog after the construction units generally start work in the future, the Building Materials Supply Joint Office negotiated with relevant departments and decided to prepare materials for the cross-year project in advance. At present, 70 to 80 million bricks have begun to be transported; at the same time, preparations are being made to concentrate efforts to rush to transport materials for cross-year projects.

    北京市运输公司是怎样配合基本建设的
    李牧生
    做好运输工作，是完成基本建设任务的一个重要环节。如果对这一点估计不足，就将严重影响基本建设工作的顺利进行。这是北京市一九五二年基本建设中的重要教训之一。
    一九五二年九月，北京市普遍开始了基本建设。但各施工单位事先对运输工作的重要性认识不足，一切都准备好了，就是没有考虑运输问题；北京市运输公司也缺乏预见性，对于即将到来的巨大运输任务，没有充分的思想准备和行动准备。到九月下旬，各施工单位普遍开工，建筑器材的运输任务突然增多，车辆供不应求。而北京市运输公司在车辆调配方面，仍然沿用平时“头痛医头、脚痛医脚”的老办法，结果各个工地都占用了少数车辆，但都不能解决问题。到十月上旬，北京市运输公司已承揽而未运输的货物超过其所有车辆每日运输量的十倍多，积压待运的建筑器材达七十万吨以上
    （煤、粮等生活资料的积压尚未统计在内）。因此造成施工单位停工待料及待料开工的严重现象。例如北京市许多学校的校舍建筑，原定十月中旬开工，工人都到工地了，因为材料运不上来，迟到十一月上旬才正式开工，不仅影响了工程进度，并且造成很大的浪费。
    由于运输工具供不应求，私营“黄牛行”即乘机哄抬运价。例如由马家堡运砖到宣武门附近，运输公司规定每块砖运价六十五元，私营“黄牛行”则哄抬到九十五元甚至一百一十元。
    北京市运输公司针对这些严重情况，首先建议在北京市财政经济委员会领导下，由市公用局、工商局、北京市建筑公司、华北基本建设工程公司和北京市运输公司组成运输联合办公室，共同协商解决运输问题。联合办公室根据各建筑单位施工进度和工程性质，分别轻重缓急，进行排队，以集中力量重点突击的方式分配运输工具。同时组织检查小组，到各工地进行重点检查，对停工待料比较严重的单位，作适当的配车。并到北京市郊区动员了二千辆马车，从青岛、济南、河北、天津等地调来一百一十八辆汽车、五百辆马车，协助抢运。
    同时，北京市运输公司改变了过去普遍照顾的调车方法，采取了集中所有车辆统一调度的方式。停止各分支机构各自揽运，改归市公司营运科集中承揽运输任务，统一分配。为了完成基本建设器材与生活资料的运输任务，把各分支机构所有车辆分为固定车和机动车（长途汽车和供应生活资料的车作为固定车）。根据各分支机构的需要情况，规定一定数量的车辆，由各分支机构自行掌握，其余都作为机动车，由市公司统一调配，参加基本建设器材的运输。为照顾零星运输的需要，每一分支机构在市公司同意下，留下少数车辆作为机动车。
    大规模基本建设器材的运输工作，如果没有一套严密的制度和科学的车辆调拨方法，不但运输力的浪费很难避免，且将因各种建筑材料不能及时运达工地，而严重影响施工程序和进度。北京市运输公司过去缺乏业务统计，在这次基本建设材料运输中，对各托运单位与工地情况又没有完全掌握，而各托运部门对此也缺乏经验，因而双方不能密切配合，往往发生场地小、车辆多，装卸不能及时，或车到不发货等现象。因此在开始一段时期，运输力的浪费是很严重的。该公司为了改进这一情况，除了发动工人尽量提高车辆运输效能和建议各有关单位改进发货工作外，并初步建立了以下几种制度：
    一、托运计划表：托运前，货主必须填写托运计划表，说明货物种类、数量、地点、要求完成期限等。运输公司可根据这种表格了解物料情况，以便有计划地调配运输工具。
    二、车辆调拨单：车辆分配后，由市公司发给货主车辆调拨单，货主凭此单向各分支机构调拨车辆。这样可避免各分支机构随便调配车辆浪费运输力。
    三、统一表报制度：各分支机构逐日填报每天运量及待运物资储存量，市公司根据这种表报可以了解各分支机构及整个公司每天运输的完成情况和待运货物储存量，以便及时调配车辆，分配任务。
    四、工地及发货地点情况调查图：公司把每一部门的发货地点及工地都绘成图表，并详细说明位置、距离、现场容车量、道面情况等，便于掌握详细情况适当配车，同时了解工地建筑性质，以便分别轻重缓急进行排队。
    由于北京市运输公司及时地改变了初期的被动混乱状态，采取了抓住重点、分别缓急的方针，大胆改进了工作方法，并争取有关部门的大力支持，在两个月的时间内，基本上抢运完了北京市一九五二年基本建设所需的器材，同时也照顾到了全市经常的、生活资料的供应。
    但是，北京市运输公司一九五二年基本建设材料运输工作中，仍然存在着不少问题。例如私营车辆还没有一个统一的管理机构，也没有一套具体的管理办法，仅由北京市运输公司以“互助组”的形式组织了部分私营汽车和马车（约占私营车辆五分之四）。因为“互助组”是建立在自愿的基础上，而运输公司又不能掌握全部货源，在货运不正常的情况下，常常会引起运输秩序的混乱。另外，在车辆调配方面还不够科学和不够灵活，车辆运输效能还没有充分发挥，运输力的浪费仍然相当严重，运输成本尚过高，等等。这都是亟待改进的。
    为了更有力地配合一九五三年基本建设，北京市运输公司正请示市财政经济委员会，准备由有关部门组织统一的运输管理委员会，统一货源、统一运价、对私营车辆进行必要的组织与管理，以集中运输力量，完成运输任务。为了平衡车队力量，便于集中调拨，把所有车辆重新编队，这样可以加强领导，逐步作到实行单车核算制，降低运输成本。另外，并准备实行专车专运，以提高工人劳动效率，充分发挥车辆潜力。
    一九五三年北京市基本建设的规模较去年更为巨大。去年在市财政经济委员会领导下成立的“运输联合办公室”，基本上是为了适应大规模突击运输的一种带紧急性的组织形式。这一组织形式，已不能满足今年更加繁重的运输任务的要求。因此，在政务院财政经济委员会公布建筑器材统一管理以后，北京市财政经济委员会即取消了去年由施工部门与运输部门组成的“运输联合办公室”，而在市财政经济委员会领导下，由建筑器材生产部门与运输部门共同组织了“建筑器材供应联合办公室”。参加这一机构的有北京市财政经济委员会、北京市建筑器材公司，中央直属工程公司生产科、华北基本建设工程公司生产科、北京市合作社、北京市运输公司等九个单位。建筑器材供应联合办公室是一种产、运、销相结合的组织形式。建筑部门可以在联合办公室统一解决器材配购和运输问题，简化了手续，节省了人力。
    由于北京市基本建设工程的设计工作进展迟缓，绝大部分建筑单位尚未开始备料，而跨年度（一九五二年）工程又因经费未拨下来亦无法进行备料，以致发生目前运输力过剩的反常现象。一月初旬，北京市运输公司每日车辆出勤率平均仅三分之一左右。为了改进这一情况，争取在淡季把剩余运输力全部使用起来，以避免将来各建筑单位普遍开工后发生积压材料现象，建筑器材供应联合办公室与有关部门洽商决定，跨年度工程提前备料。目前七、八千万块砖已开始运输；同时正准备集中力量，突击抢运跨年度工程用料。
