    At the Construction Site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station
    Winter days are short, and night falls early on the Zhigulevsky Mountains. At this time, at the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, on both banks of the Volga River, hundreds of thousands of electric lights illuminate the vast construction site, making it bright as day. Whether it's day or night, activities never cease at the site of this great communist construction project.
    Near Mogutova Mountain, excavators are digging in the foundation pit for the future hydroelectric station building. The foundation pit is so huge that even a ten-story building would be hidden from sight inside. At the bottom of the foundation pit, which has now reached its planned depth, concrete pouring is underway.
    Excavation in the foundation pit of the lower water gate is nearing completion. Many steel bar workers and cement workers are currently working here. With the help of electric suction dredges, hydraulic machinery workers have completed the alluvium of the third coffer dam. This coffer dam has earth walls spanning eight kilometers, preventing the Volga River's water from entering the foundation pit where excavation is taking place.
    Now that the preparatory work for the two huge foundation pits at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction site has been completed, the work of the drainage workers is of particular importance. They must fight against the river water that is desperately pouring into the foundation pits and the water seeping from underground. The personnel in charge of drainage work – engineers, technicians, and workers – are setting up many deep-earth pumps along the underground water passages, some of which reach forty meters below the ground.
    In the construction project of the Volga-Don Canal, many suggestions from innovators who overcame great difficulties were adopted. However, these experiences are not enough under the conditions of building the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station; faster construction speeds, more ambitious scale, and different geological conditions all require more new, creative inventions and improvements. For example, the drainage drilling method was improved in the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. As a result, it is easier to drill through firm soil layers such as clay. This method has increased the drilling speed by two or three times.
    Engineer Fyodor Engel said: "I find it difficult to say who exactly is the creator of the new drilling method that brought us such great efficiency. I think it is very appropriate to say that the creator is the collective. From an ordinary piston worker to the chief engineer, all participated in the production meeting. At this meeting, we discussed methods to improve our work. The new drilling method was created in this way."
    Engel said: "We all feel extremely proud that, due to the rapid installation of deep underground pumps, we were able to prepare the concrete pouring work in the various foundation pits in a short period of time."
    All the construction staff share the same view as Fyodor Engel. For them, completing the tasks assigned by the government on time is the most important thing.
    This year, the earthwork volume of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction project will increase by 20 million cubic meters compared to 1952. Most of these tasks have been hydraulically mechanized, because transporting the large amount of soil excavated from the trenches by hydraulic power is faster and more economical than transporting it by trucks. This hydraulic mechanization method of soil transportation was implemented based on the suggestion of hydraulic mechanization staff member Xie Gewolunsky. This method is: building a simple soil accumulation place in the foundation pit, then using hydraulic power to wash the large chunks of soil in the soil accumulation place into slurry, and then transporting them out of the foundation pit through pipelines.
    The workers' high level of work enthusiasm, as well as the rationalization proposals and advanced work methods they created in close cooperation with engineers and technicians, have greatly promoted the speed of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction project and saved the country millions of rubles. Thanks to their efforts, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station – the world's largest hydroelectric station – is approaching its completion date day by day. (Attached picture)

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    在古比雪夫水电站的建筑工地上
    冬季的日子是很短的，夜幕很早就降落到什古列夫斯基山上。这时候，在古比雪夫水电站的建筑工地上，在伏尔加河两岸上，便有数十万盏电灯照耀着，把辽阔的建筑工程工地照得通明。不管是白天或是黑夜，在这个伟大的共产主义建设工程的现场上，是一刻也不停止活动的。
    在莫古多瓦山的近旁，掘土机手们正在未来的水电站建筑物下面的基坑内进行掘土工作。基坑是如此的巨大，甚至把十层大楼放在里边也会连房顶都隐没不见。在现已达到预定深度的基坑底里，正在进行着混凝土的浇灌工作。
    在下水闸的基坑内进行的掘土工作即将完成。现在这里有许多铁筋工人和水泥工人在工作着。水力机械工人们借电气吸土机之助，已完成了冲积第三个横堤的工程。这个横堤的土壁长达八公里，它防堵着伏尔加河的水，不让它侵入正在进行掘土工作基坑。
    现在，当古比雪夫水电站建筑工地上的两个巨大基坑的准备工作业已完成的时候，排水工人的工作便具有特别重要的意义了。他们要和那些竭力向基坑内倾注的河水和由地底下渗出来的水进行斗争。担任排水工作的人员们——工程师、技师和工人们正在地下水道路上设立许多深入地层的抽水机，有的抽水机深入到离地面四十公尺以下的地方。
    在伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑工程中，曾有许多克服巨大困难的革新者的建议被采用了。但是这些经验在建设古比雪夫水电站的条件下就显得不够了；更快的建设速度，更加宏大的规模和不同的地质条件，都要求有更多新的、创造性的发明与改进。例如，在古比雪夫水电站的建设工程中曾改进了排水凿孔法。因而要凿通像粘土这样结实的土层也就更加容易了。这种方法已把凿孔的速度提高了二、三倍。
    工程师菲多尔·安格尔说：“我很难说出究竟谁是给我们带来这样巨大功效的新凿孔法的创造者。我认为，如果说创造者是集体，那是很合适的。从一个普通的活塞工人起直到总工程师，都参加了生产会议。在这个会议上我们讨论了改进我们工作的方法。新的凿孔法就是如此产生的。”
    安格尔说：“我们都感到极大的自豪，由于迅速地设立了深入地下的抽水机，我们得以在短短的期限内准备好了在各个基坑内浇灌混凝土的工作。”
    所有的建设工作人员们都有和菲多尔·安格尔同样的看法。对于他们说来，限期完成政府所规定的任务就是最重要的事情。
    今年，古比雪夫水电站建设工程的挖土量要比一九五二年增加二千万立方公尺。这些工作大部分已水力机械化，因为用水力运送从壕内挖掘出来的大量泥土比用汽车运送要迅速而经济得多。这种水力机械化的运土方法是根据水力机械化工作人员谢·盖沃伦斯基的建议而实行的。这种方法就是：在基坑内筑成一个简单的堆土所，再用水力把堆土所里的大块泥土冲成泥浆，然后由输送管把它们运出基坑之外。
    工人们的高度的劳动热情，以及他们和工程师、技术人员密切合作下所创造的合理化建议与先进的工作方法，大大地促进了古比雪夫水电站建筑工程的速度，并为国家节省了数百万卢布。在他们的努力之下，古比雪夫水电站——世界上最大的水电站的建设工程，正在一天比一天地接近完工的日期。（附图片）
