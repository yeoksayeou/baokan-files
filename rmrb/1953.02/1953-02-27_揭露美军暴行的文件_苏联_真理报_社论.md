    Documents Exposing the Atrocities of the U.S. Military
    —Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda"
    Two new documents exposing the crimes committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in Korea have been published in the newspaper. The investigation report issued by the Committee for Investigating the Atrocities of the American Aggressors and the Li Seung-man Gang and Estimating the Damage They Caused, established by the Central Committee of the Democratic United Fatherland Front of Korea, lists shocking facts ascertained after long and thorough investigations. The confession made by Colonel Hubel, Chief of Staff of the 1st Air Wing of the captured U.S. Marine Corps, further illustrates the purposes and methods of the interventionists' bacteriological warfare. These documents once again expose the towering crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors.

    The report of the Investigation Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic United Fatherland Front of Korea states that the American interventionists, in violation of all norms of international law and brutally trampling upon the basic principles of human morality, have committed unprecedented atrocities on Korean soil. They have used cruel weapons of mass slaughter on a large scale, such as napalm bombs, bacteriological weapons, and chemical weapons. The aggressors committed unspeakable atrocities against captured officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Prisoner-of-war camps set up on Geoje Island, Bongam Island, Jeju Island, and in Busan and other places have become torture chambers for torturing and murdering prisoners of war. The American aggressors who invaded Korea are expanding the scale of their heinous crimes every day.

    Recently, the U.S. military has intensified its barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea. Although these bombings have not achieved the expected strategic results, as U.S. generals have admitted more than once, large-scale air raids continue. The U.S. military is attempting to raze the cities and villages of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the ground by systematic bombing.

    The Investigation Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic United Fatherland Front of Korea lists specific materials regarding the terror raids conducted by the interventionists. It is worth pointing out that during World War II, U.S. aircraft never bombed and strafed any concentration of German fascist troops or any German monopoly capital's military enterprises as barbarously as they are now bombing and strafing Korea. In 1952, U.S. aircraft dropped more than 52,000 bombs of various sizes on Pyongyang and its suburbs, averaging 1,000 bombs per square kilometer of the city area.

    The American aggressors not only barbarously bombed Korean cities and villages. Since 1951, they have also been widely using bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons. Since January 28, 1952, U.S. interventionists have been systematically using aircraft to drop insects carrying typhus, plague, cholera, and other infectious disease bacteria over the entire territory of North Korea.

    Captured U.S. Colonel Hubel confessed to the terrible facts about bacteriological warfare. He is not an ordinary soldier, but a particularly trusted and well-informed officer of the U.S. armed forces. He confessed that the overall plan for U.S. bacteriological warfare in Korea was issued by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951. The instructions issued by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the commencement of bacteriological warfare in Korea and stipulated that after an initial short experimental phase, the bacteriological warfare should be gradually expanded.

    Colonel Hubel confessed the bombing methods, personnel, and timing of the bacteriological warfare. This confession, together with the confessions made earlier by U.S. captured officers O'Neill, Inak, Quinn, and Kneis, who directly participated in the airdropping of bacteriological bombs, confirms the conclusion reached by the International Scientific Commission, namely, that the people of Korea and China have indeed become the targets of continuous bacteriological warfare by the U.S. military, and the U.S. military has used many different methods of spreading bacteria, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese army during World War II. The American aggressors are attempting to use Korea as a site for testing the effectiveness of bacteriological killing. From January 28 to March 25, 1952, the U.S. military used bacteriological weapons more than 400 times in the northern territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Plague, cholera, typhus, and other infectious disease bacteria were systematically dropped on cities and villages in Korea and Northeast China.

    Most notably: Colonel Hubel confessed that the U.S. military command took various special confidentiality measures to keep the secrets of bacteriological warfare from their own personnel and allies. They ordered that bacteriological bombs must be dropped together with ordinary bombs and napalm bombs, so that it would appear to be an ordinary bombing. To enhance secrecy, when aircraft flew over Korean territory, pilots had to keep a napalm bomb on the plane before dropping the bacteriological bombs, so that if the plane crashed, it would inevitably burn and destroy the evidence. This is the true face of the U.S. ruling clique that deceives the American people and the people of all countries. This proves the cowardice of the U.S. generals and their fear in the face of an angry humanity.

    At the United Nations General Assembly meetings, U.S. representatives shamelessly attempted to deny the fact that bacteriological warfare was being conducted in Korea, but they cannot escape in the face of the facts. It was not without purpose that the U.S. government refused to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons; obviously, it wanted to continue using these weapons at will. U.S. official representatives, such as Alden H. Waitt, Chief of the Chemical Warfare Department of the U.S. Army, praised bacteriological weapons as effective means of warfare with great potential. Waitt said that the United States cannot ignore this weapon, especially because it is both cheap and simple. General Cleary, Chief of Research and Development of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said that it is not generals but bacteria that can win wars.

    The crimes committed by the U.S. military authorities in Korea are not accidental. These crimes are a direct result of the policy implemented by the U.S. ruling clique on the Korean issue. The purpose of this policy is to continue the war of plunder against the Korean people and to expand aggression against Korea and China. The U.S. delegation to the United Nations, in its discussion of the Korean issue, has again shown by its actions that the U.S. ruling clique does not want to stop the bloodshed, but to expand it.

    China's "People's Daily" said: "We call on all peace-loving people of Asia and the world to immediately mobilize and take action to stop the U.S. imperialist's inhumane bacteriological warfare. All scientists with a sense of justice and far-sighted politicians, all people who do not want to see plagues rampant in the world, have a responsibility to stand up and speak out against the mad plan of the American plague manufacturers and spreaders to recreate the scene of the Black Death epidemic that ravaged Europe five hundred years ago... The United Nations General Assembly should immediately take measures to require governments of all countries to ratify and abide by the 1925 Geneva 'Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare' to ensure that bacteriological warfare that threatens mankind will no longer occur."

    U.S. imperialists will not hesitate to use the most heinous means in their struggle against the freedom and independence of all peoples. The dirty and bloody means adopted by those failed imperialists in history have become the basis of the policies of U.S. imperialism.

    From the entire course of the Korean War, it can be seen that a nation that resolutely defends its freedom and independence cannot be defeated. The heroic Korean people, supported by the brave Chinese People's Volunteers in their just war of liberation, are inflicting significant defeats on the aggressors.

    The crimes of the U.S. imperialists, who have embarked on the road of Hitler's dictatorship, have deeply aroused the indignation of all honest people. The towering crimes of the U.S. aggressors have aroused universal hatred and contempt. All peace-loving people stand on the side of the Korean people. The men and women of the Soviet Union, together with peace-loving people of all countries, express brotherly solidarity with the Korean people who are bravely defending the honor, freedom, and independence of their motherland. The peace-loving people of all countries have heightened their vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialist war instigators.

    The towering crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors in Korea must be stopped!

    揭露美军暴行的文件
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    揭露美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜所犯的罪行的两个新文件已在报上发表了。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会成立的调查美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮暴行及估计他们造成的损害的委员会所发表的调查报告，列举了在进行长期和彻底的调查后所确定的惊人事实。被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校许威布尔所作的供词，更说明了干涉者进行细菌战的目的和方法。这些文件再一次揭露了美国侵略者犯下的滔天罪行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的调查委员会的报告说，美国干涉者破坏国际法的一切准则，粗暴地蹂躏人类道德的基本原则，在朝鲜国土上犯下了空前未有的暴行。他们大规模使用凝固汽油弹、细菌武器和化学武器等大批屠杀人民的残忍武器。侵略者对被俘的人民军和中国人民志愿军的官兵犯了难以形容的暴行。设在巨济岛、蜂岩岛和济州岛上以及釜山等地的战俘营已变成了折磨和谋杀战俘的刑房。进犯朝鲜的美国侵略者天天扩大他们穷凶极恶的犯罪规模。
    最近，美军加紧对朝鲜的和平城市和乡村进行野蛮轰炸。虽然这些轰炸并未获得预期的战略结果，正像美国将领不只一次地招认过的那样，但大规模的空袭仍在继续进行。美军妄图用进行系统轰炸的方法来把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的城市和乡村夷为平地。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的调查委员会列举了关于干涉者进行的恐怖空袭的具体材料。值得指出的是，在第二次世界大战期间，美国飞机对任何一个德国法西斯军队的集中地或对任何一个德国垄断资本的军需企业，都未曾像现在在朝鲜那样野蛮地轰炸和扫射过。在一九五二年，美国飞机对平壤和它的近郊投下了五万二千多枚各种大小型炸弹，平均对市区的每一平方公里投下一千枚炸弹。
    美国侵略者不只野蛮地轰炸朝鲜的城市和乡村。自从一九五一年以来，他们还一直在广泛地使用细菌武器和化学武器。自从一九五二年一月二十八日以来，美国干涉者一直在有系统地用飞机对北朝鲜全境投掷带有斑疹伤寒、鼠疫、霍乱和其他传染病细菌的昆虫。
    被俘的美国上校许威布尔供出了关于细菌战的可怕事实。他并不是一个普通士兵，而是美国武装部队的一个特别受信任的熟悉情况的军官。他供认美国在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月发下的。美国参谋长联席会议发下的指示，命令在朝鲜开始细菌战，还规定了经过最初一个短的试验性阶段后，要渐渐扩大细菌战。
    许威布尔上校供出了进行细菌战的轰炸方法、人物和时间。这个供词，和直接参加用飞机投掷细菌弹的美国被俘军官奥尼尔、伊纳克、奎恩和克尼斯在前些时候所作的供词，证实了国际科学委员会所得出的结论，就是说，朝鲜和中国的人民，确已成为美国军队不断进行细菌战的攻击目标，美国军队使用了许多不同的撒布细菌的方法，其中有一些方法看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间所使用的方法加以发展而成的。美国侵略者正企图利用朝鲜作为试验用细菌杀人的效力的场所。从一九五二年一月二十八日到三月二十五日，美军在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部领土使用细菌武器达四百多次。鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒和其他传染病细菌被有系统地投到朝鲜和中国东北的城市和乡村。
    最值得注意的是：许威布尔上校供认，美军司令部采取了各种特别的保密措施，不让他们自己的人员和盟国知道细菌战的秘密。他们命令：细菌弹必须和普通炸弹及凝固汽油弹在一起投掷，因为这样就使人看来是一种普通的轰炸。为了加强保密起见，飞机在朝鲜领土上空飞行时，飞行人员在没有投掷细菌弹之前，必须留有一枚凝固汽油弹在飞机上，这样，如果飞机坠毁，它就必然会燃烧起来，焚毁证据。这就是欺瞒美国民众和所有国家的民众的美国统治集团的真面目。这证明美国将军们的懦怯和他们在愤怒的人类面前的恐惧。
    在联合国大会会议上，美国代表们曾无耻地企图否认在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实，但是在事实的面前他们是不能逃脱的。美国政府拒绝批准禁止使用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书，这并不是没有用意的；显然它想随意地继续使用这些武器。美国的官方代表们，例如美国陆军部化学战争处处长阿尔登·赫·韦特，都称赞细菌武器是具有巨大潜力的有效的战争手段。韦特说，美国不能忽视这种武器，特别是因为它既便宜又简单。美国陆军部化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西将军说过，能赢得战争的不是将军而是细菌。
    美国军事当局在朝鲜所犯的这种罪行并不是偶然的。这些罪行是美国统治集团对朝鲜问题所实行的政策的直接结果。这种政策的目的在于继续进行对朝鲜人民的掠夺战争并扩大对朝鲜和中国的侵略。美国驻联合国的代表团在讨论朝鲜问题时又用它的行动表明，美国统治集团不要停止流血，而要扩大流血。
    中国“人民日报”说：“我们呼吁一切爱好和平的亚洲人民和全世界人民立即动员起来，采取行动，制止美帝国主义灭绝人性的细菌战。一切有正义感的科学家们和有远见的政治家们，一切不愿看见瘟疫在世界上猖獗泛滥的人们都有责任站出来说话，反对美国瘟疫制造者和传播者们企图使五百年前黑死病流行于欧洲的景象重新出现的疯狂计划。……联合国大会应该立即采取措施要求各国政府批准并遵守一九二五年日内瓦‘关于禁用窒息性、有毒的或其他瓦斯以及细菌武器的议定书’，以保证威胁人类的细菌战不再出现。”
    美帝国主义者在他们为反对各国人民的自由和独立而进行的斗争中是不惜使用最凶恶的手段的。在历史上那些失败了的帝国主义者所采取过的肮脏和血腥的手段，都成了美帝国主义者的政策的基础。
    从朝鲜战争的整个过程可以看出，一个坚决维护自身自由和独立的民族是不可被战胜的。在进行正义的解放战争中得到了勇敢的中国人民志愿军支援的英雄的朝鲜人民，正使侵略者遭受重大的失败。
    已经走上了希特勒独裁道路的美帝国主义者的罪行，已深深地激起了一切正直人民的愤慨。美国侵略者的滔天罪行引起了普遍的仇恨和鄙视。一切爱好和平的人民都站在朝鲜人民方面。苏联男女，和各国爱好和平的人民在一起，向英勇捍卫祖国的荣誉、自由和独立的朝鲜人民，表示兄弟般的声援。各国爱好和平的人民已对帝国主义战争制造者的阴谋提高警惕。
    必须制止美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的滔天罪行！
