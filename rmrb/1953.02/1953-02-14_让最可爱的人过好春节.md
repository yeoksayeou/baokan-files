    As the Spring Festival approaches, people are even more concerned about the most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting against the American invaders in the icy and snowy lands of Korea. Everyone hopes that our heroes will have a happy Spring Festival on the front lines.

    Not long ago, the workers of the Shanghai State-owned Yimin Food Manufacturing Plant No. 1 manufactured four hundred and fifty truckloads of food for the front lines with doubled efforts. In the words of the workers, these nutritious and delicious foods were made not only with hands and machines but also with the deep feelings of every worker for the Volunteers.

    At the beginning of this year, driven by the greatest enthusiasm, the workers of the Yimin Food Manufacturing Plant No. 1 decided to increase food production by 80% in January compared to December of last year, to provide a large supply of food for the Volunteers to feast on during the Spring Festival. The workers in the canned pork workshop, without waiting for the trade union to call, automatically put forward the slogan "Sweat one more drop, let the Volunteers eat one more can of meat during the Spring Festival," and launched a labor competition. The workers responsible for cutting meat, seasoning, and other tasks voluntarily gave up their Sunday holidays and extended their working hours by two hours every day to rush to complete this glorious task. At that time, although the plant's exhaust box and sterilizing pot had been working around the clock for twenty-four hours, they still could not meet the requirements of the new task. The workers were very anxious because the slower the machine was, the fewer products would be produced, and the less food the Volunteers would receive during the Spring Festival. Under such circumstances, the workers remembered the indomitable fighting spirit of the most beloved people on the front lines. Technician Zhang Shengtang encouraged himself with the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang. He carefully studied the internal structure of the exhaust box and, after two days of effort, increased the efficiency of the exhaust box by 7% per minute. Yuan Zijun, the leader of the sterilization team, stubbornly stayed in the workshop for five days and five nights, leading the team members to use their brains. With the assistance of technicians, they added a batch of cold water pipes and iron baskets in the most economical way, which increased the turnover speed of the sterilizing pot by 22%. Old workers Qiu Wenxing, Yang Jinkun, and others, encouraged by the enthusiasm of the entire plant's workers, researched and invented meat cutting machines and canning machines. As a result, the entire production process of canned pork in the plant was greatly accelerated, ensuring the supply of Spring Festival food to the front lines.

    The workers of the Yimin Food Manufacturing Plant No. 1 not only accelerated the speed of food supply but also carefully carried out the work of eliminating miscellaneous bacteria in the food. In every workshop, the workers disinfected the ground, walls, roofs, and machines every day. "Do not let the Volunteers eat a piece of bad meat" has become a unified action slogan of all workers. Everyone working in the workshop wears steamed white coats, hats, and masks; some workers also wear disinfected white cloth boots. At the entrance of the egg powder workshop, no matter who enters, the whole body must be sprayed with disinfectant before entering. This attention is already thorough enough, but the workers in the canning room are still worried that the miscellaneous bacteria in their mouths will fly out of the masks and into the egg powder. They added a clause to the patriotic pact, guaranteeing not to speak when entering the canning room. Now, according to the test records, there is not a single miscellaneous bacterium in the canned pork, which is very difficult to achieve. Why are the workers working so hard? Because it is to support the most beloved people.

    The workers of the Yimin Food Manufacturing Plant No. 1 established close contact with the Volunteers very early. Last year, many of the comfort candies that the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea brought to the front lines were manufactured by the workers of the plant. After the Volunteer soldiers ate the sugar made by the plant, they wrote letters to the workers to express their gratitude and sent back the sugar wrappers, suggesting that the plant reuse these sugar wrappers to save national property. After this large batch of Spring Festival food is supplied to the front lines, the feelings between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the workers of the plant will become even more harmonious.

### 让最可爱的人过好春节

    让最可爱的人过好春节
    新华社记者　朱彬
    当春节到来的时候，人们更加惦念着远在朝鲜冰天雪地中打击美国侵略者的最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。人人都希望我们的英雄们在前线过一个愉快的春节。
    不久以前，上海国营益民食品制造第一厂的职工们以加倍的精力制造了四百五十辆大卡车的食品送往前线。这些营养丰富、味道可口的食品，用工人们的话来说，不仅是用手和机器做的，而且是用每个工人对志愿军的深情厚意做成的。
    今年年初，益民食品制造第一厂的职工为最大的热诚所驱使，决定今年一月份要比去年十二月增产百分之八十的食品，大量供给志愿军在春节中聚餐。猪肉罐头工场的工人们，不等工会号召，自动地提出了“多流一滴汗，让志愿军在春节多吃一罐肉”的口号，展开了劳动竞赛。担任切肉、调料等工作的工人们，自动放弃星期天休假，并且每日延长两小时工作来突击完成这一光荣的任务。当时，该厂的排气箱和杀菌锅虽然已经昼夜二十四小时不停顿地工作着，但仍不能适应新任务的要求。职工们都非常着急，因为机器慢一刻，就要少出许多产品，志愿军在春节中就会少得到一些食品。在这样的情况下，工人们想起了最可爱的人在前线的不屈不挠的战斗精神。技术员张升堂就以黄继光的英勇事迹来勉励自己，他仔细地研究了排气箱的内部构造，经过两天的努力，使排气箱每分钟的效率提高了百分之七。杀菌小组组长袁子俊顽强地五天五晚不离开工场，领导组员们动脑筋，在技术人员的协助下，
    他们以最节约的办法增添了一批冷水管子和铁蓝子，使杀菌锅的周转速度提高了百分之二十二。老工人邱文星、杨金坤等在全厂工人的热情鼓舞下，研究发明了切肉机和装罐机。因此，全厂猪肉罐头的整个生产过程大大地加速了，保证了前线春节食品的供应。
    益民食品制造第一厂的职工们不但加快了食品供应的速度，而且还细心地进行着消灭食品中杂菌的工作。各个车间，不论地面、墙壁、屋顶、机器，工人们每天都要进行严密的消毒。“不让志愿军吃到一块坏肉”，成为全体工人一致的行动口号。在车间工作的人都穿戴着经过蒸煮的白色罩衣、帽子、口罩；有些工人还穿了消过毒的白布靴子。在蛋粉车间门口，不论谁进去，在进门之前全身上下都得喷射消毒药水。这样注意已经够周到了，装罐间的工人们还耽心自己口里的杂菌飞出口罩投到蛋粉里去，他们在爱国公约上增加了一条，保证进入装罐间不说话。现在，根据化验记录，猪肉罐头中已经没有一个杂菌，这是很难做到的。工人们为什么这样的努力呢？因为这是支援最可爱的人的。
    益民食品制造第一厂的职工很早就和志愿军建立着密切的联系。去年，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团带往前线的慰问糖，有不少是该厂职工们制造的。志愿军战士们在吃到了该厂所制的糖以后，曾经写信给工人们致谢，还把包糖的纸寄回来，建议该厂把这些包糖纸再用一次，以节约国家财产。这次大批春节食品供应前线后，中国人民志愿军和该厂职工们的感情将更加融洽了。
