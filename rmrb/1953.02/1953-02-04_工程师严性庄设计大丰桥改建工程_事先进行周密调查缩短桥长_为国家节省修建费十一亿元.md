Engineer Yan Xingzhuang Designs Reconstruction of Dafeng Bridge
    Reduces Bridge Length Through Thorough Investigation
    Saving the State Eleven Billion Yuan in Construction Costs

The Dafeng Bridge project in Tianjin, completed on January 11th, saved eleven billion yuan in funds because the designer, engineer Yan Xingzhuang, conducted a thorough investigation and research before the design, shortening the bridge's length.

Dafeng Bridge is located on the Nanyun (South Transport) River in Tianjin and was originally a wooden bridge. To extend the bridge's lifespan, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to rebuild it into a reinforced concrete structure. Engineer Yan Xingzhuang was specifically responsible for the design work of this project. After receiving this task, Yan Xingzhuang collected design data from all aspects. He thought that the "independent flow into the sea" and other diversion river construction projects were underway upstream of the Nanyun River, and the amount of water flowing to Tianjin would definitely decrease in the future; after the river width was reduced, the bridge length could also be shortened, and the state could save a sum of money. To confirm this situation, Yan Xingzhuang visited engineers who had dredged the Nanyun River and were familiar with its conditions, and contacted relevant units such as the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau. In this way, he not only collected a lot of historical data about the Nanyun River, but also absorbed many valuable opinions on this design work. Subsequently, Yan Xingzhuang calculated based on the maximum flow of the Nanyun River Yangliuqing Hydrological Station in 1939, when the water level was the highest, and proved that shortening the length of the new bridge would not have a great impact on the water flow, nor would it scour the riverbed. After the completion of various upstream projects in the future, the flow will be greatly reduced, so the safety of the bridge is guaranteed.

Yan Xingzhuang was not satisfied after mastering these historical data. To prove whether this calculation was practical, he conducted on-site surveys of the Dafeng Bridge and also investigated several bridges downstream of the Dafeng Bridge. From the investigation, he learned that the bridge lengths of the Jinhua Bridge and Jinzhong Bridge downstream were much shorter than the original length of the Dafeng Bridge; and the riverbed on the south bank of the two bridges was often without water immersion for about ten meters. Based on scientific calculations and the results of actual investigations, Yan Xingzhuang affirmed that shortening the length of the bridge in the reconstruction project was completely reasonable. So he took the initiative to ask the relevant leadership for instructions and shortened the original 56-meter bridge to a 33-meter design. His opinion was approved by the leadership, saving the country eleven billion yuan in construction costs.

    工程师严性庄设计大丰桥改建工程
    事先进行周密调查缩短桥长
    为国家节省修建费十一亿元
    天津市在一月十一日改建完工的大丰桥工程，由于设计人、工程师严性庄在设计前进行了周密的调查研究，把桥长缩短，节省了十一亿元的资金。
    大丰桥在天津南运河上面，原来是一座木桥。为了使桥梁的寿命延长，天津市人民政府决定把这座木桥改建成钢筋混凝土结构的桥梁。这一工程的设计工作，由工程师严性庄具体负责。严性庄接到这个任务后，就从各方面搜集设计资料。他想到南运河的上游正在进行“独流入海”和其他引河修建工程，将来这条河流到天津的水量一定会减少；河宽减缩以后，桥的长度也可以缩短，国家就能节省一笔资金。为了证实这一情况，严性庄访问了曾经疏浚过南运河熟悉南运河情况的工程师，并到华北水利工程局等有关单位去联系。这样，他不但搜集了很多有关南运河的历史资料，同时还吸收了许多对这一设计工作的宝贵意见。随后，严性庄根据水位最高的一九三九年南运河杨柳青水文站的最大流量推算，证明把新桥长度缩短后，对水流影响不大，也不会冲刷河床。将来上游各项工程完工以后，流量还会大大减少，因此，桥梁的安全是有保障的。
    严性庄掌握了这些历史资料以后，并不满足。为证明这个推算是否切合实际，他实地勘测了大丰桥，还调查了大丰桥下游的几座桥梁。从调查中，他知道了下游金华桥、金钟桥的桥长比大丰桥的原长都短很多；并且两桥南岸的河床有十公尺左右经常没有河水上浸。根据科学的推算和实际调查的结果，严性庄肯定了在改建工程中缩短桥的长度是完全合理的。于是他主动地请示有关的领导方面，把原来五十六公尺的桥梁缩短设计为三十三公尺。他的意见得到领导方面批准，为国家节省了十一亿元的修建费用。
