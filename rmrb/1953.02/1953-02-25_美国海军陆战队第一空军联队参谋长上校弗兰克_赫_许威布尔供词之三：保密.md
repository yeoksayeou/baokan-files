Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Confession Three of Colonel Frank H. Schwable, Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing, U.S. Marine Corps: Secrecy.

    As the bacteriological warfare program expanded, all matters of secrecy were reviewed at General Jerome's meeting on May 25th.

    Secrecy was emphasized at every stage of the bacteriological warfare, and this was one of the major problems faced by the 1st Marine Air Wing. Although we had no authority regarding operational actions, secrecy was an administrative matter for which we were responsible to the Fifth Air Force.

    Every possible means was to be used to deceive the enemy and to keep our own personnel unaware of these actions.

    Among our own personnel, if they were curious, the aim was to create the impression that this special mission was purely a highly specialized propaganda effort, not to be announced because premature disclosure would lose its value and because its source had to be protected.

    To the enemy, bacteriological bombs were to be dropped only with ordinary bombs, so that the special nature of the attack would not be noticed—and even if it were noticed, it could not be confirmed. Any evidence found on the ground would be claimed by us to be legitimate propaganda materials or the parachutes and canisters of flares.

    At the meeting on May 25, 1952, General Jerome, assisted by Generals Lemson-Scribner, reviewed the security measures, which, unless explicitly modified, had to be implemented.

    Absolutely nothing in writing should mention the plan or its true nature. "Bacteria," "germs," etc. were names we were forbidden to use, nor were we to mention the names of disease types, except initially to identify them with the plan. The following terms were used in formal conversations, such as "super propaganda," "super prop," special weapons, special bombs, special missions, etc.

    There were two ways to handle mission reports:

    Since the beginning of the concentration on the contamination zone, the daily flights of the 513th Squadron were reported in the squadron's usual, secret mission reports—delivered by express—reporting the bombing targets, the number of the mission, the time, and the estimated damage. Then, depending on the specific situation, "via Sinanju" or "via Kunuri" was added. This told the appropriate authorities that the 513th Squadron had carried out its cyclical, standard mission to keep its assigned area contaminated on a ten-day cycle.

    Other missions, arranged by units less frequently, were handled by marking "Super Propaganda" on, for example, the nth mission in a top-secret order. These units also used the code name "Super Propaganda" in their reports. They sent standard, secret express reports, stating the number of the mission, the type of aircraft, the direction of the target, the time of arrival over the target, the number of bombs (conventional types) dropped or the number of photographs taken, the anti-aircraft fire encountered, and other information. Immediately afterwards, the reporting unit also sent a top-secret express message to the Fifth Air Force stating: "Mission No. 'X', several 'Super Propaganda'." In this way, they reported in code the number of special bombs dropped in a normal mission.

    Any information concerning the performance of aircraft, tactics, etc., related to the bacteriological warfare program was to be reported verbally to the Operations Officer (G-3). Difficulties concerning bombs were reported to the Logistics Officer (G-4), who would then report verbally to the Commander, who would then decide whether he himself or another appropriate staff officer would report to the Fifth Air Force.

    Only those who needed to know about the plan in order for it to be carried out effectively were to be informed. Usually, a staff officer and his deputy would know about everything in their department, so that if one officer was absent, the other could handle any related matter. But this was not the case with this plan. If the informed officer was absent and an emergency occurred, the matter was to be submitted to the Chief of Staff, Executive Officer, Commander, or other senior staff officer. The reason I objected to informing the medical officer of the regiment was that the plan could proceed without his knowledge.

    The entire matter, when there was a need to discuss it, was to be mentioned only in formal settings, and even then, only behind closed doors and in subdued tones and words. The "Super Propaganda" mission was not mentioned in the daily briefings held by the General and the staff.

    Violation of secrecy in this matter, like violation of any equally important secrecy rule, was subject to trial by general court-martial.

    Prior to the Fifth Air Force's use of AD-type (Airborne Intruder-type) aircraft, only twin-engine aircraft were used.

    Before AD-type aircraft were ordered to participate in daytime operations, special weapons were used only in night operations and high-altitude photo reconnaissance flights.

    Fly over water to the maximum extent possible and avoid friendly areas. In case of malfunctions, when jettisoning bombs, drop them only in deep water at sea. Load bombs at the fewest possible number of airfields—before receiving orders to conduct large-scale operations from K-6 (the 12th Marine Air Group's base at Pyeongtaek), we only loaded bombs at K-8 base (the 513th Squadron's base in the mountains) and K-3 base (the 33rd Marine Air Group's base at Pohang).

    If feasible, the attacking aircraft should carry a napalm bomb and retain it until after the bacteriological bombs are dropped, to ensure the aircraft is burned in the event of a crash.

    General Jerome further directed that only a very limited number of pilots in the operational units should be involved in the plan, and that they should be older, more mature, and more responsible individuals; they should preferably be regular officers who made the military their career, and most importantly, they must be men whose loyalty was beyond question.

    He also emphasized that the officers and men involved in the plan must be impressed with the necessity of secrecy, its impact on national prestige, and its impact on the current enemy actions. The pilots must feel that they were a select group of people, specially chosen because of their abilities and reliability. One point was emphasized: "While in Korea, forget about it as much as possible. When you go home, you've never heard of it."

    Pilots were to be assured of their personal safety from the items being used, so as to avoid compromising secrecy due to fear of personal contamination.

    For the same reason, a brief account of recent general operations was to be given to the pilots, lest they think they were the first to wage this unconventional warfare, which might compromise secrecy for moral reasons.

    If a "Super Propaganda" bomb was dropped on an incorrect target, it was to be reported immediately. The pilot was to feel that this was a serious responsibility—not that disciplinary action was or would be taken as a result, but to maintain an accurate record of those areas that had been contaminated.

    Breaches of secrecy were to be reported verbally immediately. Any officer or soldier who seemed constantly and continuously curious about this propaganda program was to be placed under extremely close surveillance and reported directly to the General. Any pilot included in the plan who appeared in any way "out of sorts," that is, careless, unmanageable, alarmed, hesitant, etc. due to combat fatigue or other reasons, was to be immediately removed from the flight roster and reported to the General. Anyone who appeared to act suspiciously or unnaturally was also to be reported to the General. Frank H.

    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之三：保密
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之三：保密。
    当细菌战计划扩大时，一切保密事项都在杰罗姆将军五月二十五日的会议上作了检查。
    保密是在细菌战的每一阶段都加以强调的，而这是海军陆战队第一空军联队所面对的各重大问题中的一个。虽然关于作战行动我们没有权力，但是保密是一个行政上的事项，需要我们向第五航空队负责。
    要采用一切可能的办法来欺骗敌人，并使我们自己的人员不知道这些行动。
    在我们自己的人员中，假如他们好奇的话，目的在于制造一种印象：这种特殊任务完全是一种高度专门的宣传，不得宣布，因为过早公布将丧失价值，并且因为其来源必须加以护卫。
    对于敌方，细菌弹只能与普通的炸弹一起掷下，以使袭击的特殊性质不被察觉——即使察觉，也不能证实。在地面上发现的任何证据，我方将声称是合法的宣传资料或是照明弹的降落伞及弹箱。
    在一九五二年五月二十五日的会议上，杰罗姆将军，由莱姆逊——斯克里布纳将军予以协助，检查了一下保密措施，这些措施，除非明白加以修改，必须执行。
    绝对不得有书面的东西提到这个计划及其真正的性质。“细菌”、“病菌”等是我们被禁止使用的名称，也不得提疾病种类的名称，除非是最初为了把它们与计划识别起见。正式谈话中换用下列字样，如“超级宣传”，“超宣”，特殊武器，特殊炸弹，特殊任务等等。
    关于任务的报告，有两种处理办法：
    自从开始集中于沾染地带以后，五一三中队的日常飞行是在中队的通常的、秘密的任务报告——用速件递送——中报告的，其中报告轰炸的目标、第几次的任务、时间以及估计的损毁。然后视具体情况，加上“途经新安州”或“途经军隅里”。这就告诉了适当的当局：五一三中队进行了它的循环性的、标准的任务，以保持其被指派的地区在十天一次的周期内受到细菌的沾染。
    其他任务不经常的部队安排它们的任务的办法是，例如在绝密命令中的第某某次任务中标明“超级宣传”。这些单位在它们的报告中也就用“超级宣传”这个暗号。它们送交标准的、秘密的速件，说明第几次任务、飞机的型式、目标的方向、飞临目标的时间、投下炸弹（惯用的种类）的数目或所摄的照片数目、所遇到的高射炮火以及其他情报。紧接着，作报告的单位也送交第五航空队一个绝密的快件，其中说：“第某某次任务，几枚‘超级宣传’”。用这种办法，它们就用暗号报告在一个寻常任务中投下的特殊炸弹数目。
    任何与细菌战计划有关的关于飞机的表现、战术等等，都要在口头上向作战官员（G—3）报告。关于炸弹的困难向后勤官员（G—4）报告，他再在口头上向司令报告，司令然后决定是否由他自己或另一个合适的参谋部官员向第五航空队报告。
    只能告知那些需要知道这个计划以便使它有效进行的人。通常一个参谋部的官员及其副手对于他们的部门之中的所有事情都是知道的，因此，如果一个官员不在，另外一个就能处理任何有关事项。但是就这个计划来说则不然。如果知情的官员不在，而紧急的事情发生，则问题要提交参谋长、执行官、指挥官或其他高级的参谋部官员。我之所以反对通知联队的医务官，就是因为不让他知道，计划也能进行。
    整个问题，当有需要加以讨论时，只能在正式场合中提及，即使如此，也只能关起门来用抑制的声调和词句来讨论。将军与参谋部每日举行的简报会中不提“超级宣传”的任务。
    在这件事上违反保密，就像违反了同等重要的任何保密规则一样，要受到总的军事法庭的审判。
    在第五航空队起用AD型（空中侵略者式）飞机以前，只使用双引擎的飞机。
    在AD型飞机被命令参加日间行动以前，只在夜间活动中及在高空照相侦察飞行中使用特殊武器。
    要在最大限度内飞经水面并避免友好地区。遇有故障，丢卸炸弹时，只能在海面上投入深水。限在最少数目的几个飞机场装载炸弹——在接到命令自K—6（海军陆战队第十二空军大队在平泽的基地）进行大规模行动以前，我们只在K—8基地（五一三中队在群山的基地）和K—3基地（海军陆战队第三十三空军大队在浦项的基地）装载炸弹。
    假如可行的话，进行袭击的飞机要携带一枚凝固汽油弹，并在细菌弹投下以前要保留起来，以保证万一飞机坠地时焚毁飞机。
    杰罗姆将军又指示说，只有作战单位中极有限数目的驾驶员被牵连进计划中来，而他们应该是服役年限较长、较成熟、较负责的人；他们最好是以军役为事业的正规军官，并且最重要的，必须是在忠诚方面毫无问题的人。
    他又着重说，对于被牵连进计划中来的官兵，必须向他们强调保密问题的必要性、其对于国家威信的影响以及对于当前敌人行动的影响。必须使驾驶员觉得他们是精选出来的一群人，由于他们的能力与可靠而被特选的。有一点是加以强调了：“在朝鲜时，你尽可能把它忘掉，回到家里时，你就从来没有听说过它。”
    要向驾驶员保证他们个人的安全，不受所使用的物品的影响，以免由于害怕本人受到沾染而可能破坏保密。
    为了同样的原因，关于最近的一般行动，要向驾驶员作一个简短的叙述，以免他们认为他们是进行这种非正规的战争的第一批人，以致由于道德的因素而可能破坏保密。
    在一个错误的目标上投了一枚“超级宣传”弹，要立即报告。要使驾驶员觉得这是一个重大的责任——并不是要因此而采取或将采取纪律行动，而是要保持一个那些曾被沾染的地区的精确记录。
    对于保密的破坏要即刻口头报告。对于这个宣传计划显得经常不断地好奇的任何军官或兵士，都要受到极严密的监视，并直接报告将军。任何一个包括在计划中的驾驶员，如果在任何方面显得“不对头”，即是说，由于作战疲劳或其他原因而显得不小心、难以驾御、惊恐、迟疑等等，就要即刻从飞行名单上除名，并报告将军。任何人显得行动可疑或不自然，也同样要报告将军。弗兰克·赫·许威布尔（签名）（军号）04429美国海军陆战队上校一九五二年十二月十九日北朝鲜
