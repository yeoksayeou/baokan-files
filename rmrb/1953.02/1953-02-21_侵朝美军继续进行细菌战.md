October 28th was the day on which the enemy planes carried out the most bacteriological attacks and covered the widest area in their invasion of our Northeastern airspace. On this day, enemy planes (ranging from one to four) invaded Jiangjuntai, First District, Jin County, Majiajie, Ninth District, Liutaizi Zhong'anbao, Third District, Liufotang Village, Fourth District, Beizhen County, Dajie Village, Fifth District, Panshan County, Xiaohezi, Fourth District, Tai'an County, Wangjia Village, Second District, Jiangtun, Third District, Black Mountain County, and other places, dropping many spiders. These spiders were commonly found on the roads, in the fields, on trees, on rooftops, on well platforms, and on utility poles within ten to twenty minutes after the enemy planes flew over. Among the spiders collected in Liutaizi Zhong'anbao, Third District, Beizhen County, after bacteriological examination by renowned Chinese experts, it was confirmed that the spiders carried anthrax bacilli and dysentery bacilli.
	The insects and other objects dropped by the enemy planes, except for the specimens retained, were quickly burned by the local people and health organizations.
