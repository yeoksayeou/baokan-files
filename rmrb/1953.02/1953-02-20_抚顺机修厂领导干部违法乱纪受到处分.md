Fushun Machine Repair Plant's director Jiang Bo (Communist Party member) and deputy director Liu Shen (Communist Party member) have long adopted capitalist management methods in the management of the socialist enterprise, resulting in a series of errors that violate laws and discipline. They falsely reported achievements to superiors, deceived and suppressed subordinates, sought fame and praise, fabricated labor models, created backward quotas, extorted brother factories and mines, and defrauded high profits, causing irreparable political and economic losses to the Party and the state.

The production management of a socialist enterprise is built on the basis of the working class's enthusiasm for labor and creativity. As leaders of state-owned enterprises, they should rely on and give full play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the workers to continuously improve labor productivity, improve product quality, and reduce costs, creating and accumulating wealth for the country in excess. This is the fundamental method by which we manage state-owned enterprises with socialist characteristics. However, Jiang Bo and Liu Shen fundamentally violated this principle. In order to obtain illegal profits for their unit, they have long consciously and systematically overestimated working hours and materials in production management. Moreover, the proportion of overestimation has increased without end. From January to August 1950, the estimated working hours were 5.04% higher than the actual working hours, while from September to December, they were 14.38% higher. From January to August 1951, the estimated working hours were 17.45% higher than the actual working hours, while from September to December, they were 65.84% higher. In the first half of 1952, the estimated working hours were 70.99% higher than the actual working hours. The highest was even two or three times higher than the actual working hours. In order to make the estimators obey them, Jiang Bo and Liu Shen criticized those who were unwilling to overestimate several times, saying that "underestimating the work will lose money." The same was true for estimating materials. For example, from January to June last year, in the estimated materials for cast iron parts, the estimated iron water for sandboxes was 52,540 kilograms, while the actual amount needed was only 19,497 kilograms.

Due to the excessively high estimations of working hours and materials, a false impression was created: on the surface, it seemed that labor efficiency had been improved and raw materials had been saved, but in reality, it caused great waste and concealed the truth that production tasks had consistently failed to be completed. As of September last year, there were still eighty projects from 1951 that remained untouched. Secondly, due to the overestimation of materials, some "black materials" were accumulated, and when defective products were produced, they could be replaced with black materials. For example, the "labor model" Fu Guangdou's team casually reported over two hundred hard alloy tools for write-off at one time. Thirdly, due to the overestimation of working hours, serious errors were also made in the wage issue. Some workers who had not completed their tasks and produced a large number of defective products also received a lot of extra rewards. For example, a batch of tasks assigned to the cast iron workshop in February last year was 224,809 kilograms, with actual working hours of 9,926 man-hours. The workshop estimated 15,645 man-hours. Later, the workshop only completed 191,808 kilograms. Obviously, the output was not completed, but the workers still received extra bonuses equivalent to 5,719 man-hours. The extra bonus for the fourth team of the mechanical workshop in February last year was 104% of the basic wage. This kind of extra bonus was a "general division of spoils," not based on more work, more pay, which completely distorted the state's wage policy.

In order to cover up their illegal activities and conceal the false quotas, in June of last year, they instructed the workshops to reduce the working hours estimated by the factory by 30%, but fearing that the workers would find out, they ordered each workshop to establish two sets of estimation cards, one real and one fake; clear accounts to superiors, hidden accounts to subordinates, in order to deceive superiors and the factory's workers.

They treated the mechanical repair and processing entrusted by brother factories and mines with all kinds of malicious deceptive methods to defraud high profits: (1) Adding the cost of materials and labor wrongly attributed to one project to other projects. For example, the Man-made Petroleum Plant ordered a water turbine, which was not accepted during inspection because it was unqualified. They added the cost of rework to the cost of parts and boilers, calling it "body fee," resulting in the Man-made Petroleum Plant paying for two water turbines when it ordered one. (2) Randomly demanding "urgent order fees." The Steel Plant ordered a certain steel ingot mold and insulation cap, agreeing to deliver in four phases, but after half a year overdue, only 30% was completed. When the Steel Plant urged them, they demanded an additional 20% rush fee. (3) Falsely reporting types of work and procedures. A unit ordered a certain project from them, which originally did not require model, cast iron, alloy and other work hours, but these were all added when calculating the cost. (4) Frivolously "adding working hours." When a unit ordered a certain project, the original estimated riveting and welding was 8,902 man-hours, while the actual working hours were 4,291, but they added 28 man-hours at the end. (5) Selling defective products to brother factories and mines. (6) Asking exorbitant prices. The cost of making coal chutes for Shengli Mine was 300 million, but the asking price was 1.3 billion, and working hours were added after completion.

They have long treated product quality with a perfunctory attitude. For example, Wang Hengde, head of the technology section, proposed using cold casting to manufacture steel ingot molds. The results of the trial production were very fragile. However, Wang Hengde and Deputy Director Liu Shen insisted on using cold casting for mass production, resulting in 575 products becoming waste, a loss of more than 2 billion yuan. For example, when manufacturing a certain product, without hard steel material, they replaced it with soft steel. If it couldn't be case-hardened, they used potassium cyanide for case-hardening, only seeking enough surface hardness, but it would bend as soon as it was used.

For the vanity of the unit and individuals, Jiang Bo, Liu Shen, and Party Branch Secretary Du Qingyu used unscrupulous means to "cultivate labor models." Last year, the factory selected nine city-level labor models, four of whom were unqualified. One of them, named Fu Guangdou, was extremely bad in character, had served as a platoon leader in the Kuomintang army's communications company, and had long concealed his history. He engaged in petty cliques in the factory, attacked progressive workers, and falsely reported achievements. However, Du Qingyu, the secretary of the factory's general branch, rated him as a labor model at the Northeast Administrative Region level (because the "Three-Anti" movement began, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions did not hold a meeting to study this, so he could not become a labor model at the Northeast Administrative Region level), equipped Fu Guangdou's team with a full set of new Soviet lathes, and selected capable workers to work in Fu Guangdou's team. Du Qingyu required all Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in the factory to focus on supporting and "cultivating" Fu Guangdou's team in their work plans and summaries. He threatened the chairman of the trade union, saying: "If Fu Guangdou's team collapses, the trade union will be responsible." He said at a meeting of cadres from the Party and mass organizations: "If Fu Guangdou's team collapses, not only will the trade union be responsible, but the Communist Youth League will also be responsible." This created a very bad influence among the masses.

Jiang Bo, Liu Shen, and others not only made the above series of mistakes in production management, but also seriously violated the Party's policy of "both virtue and talent" in promoting cadres. For example, they promoted Wang Hengde, a person who was good at flattery and of bad character, to be the head of the technology section, and prepared to promote him to deputy director (but the Fushun Mining Bureau did not approve it). As a result, this bad element used his power to win over private individuals and place his cronies (the directors of the riveting and welding, casting, and wood model workshops promoted by him were all his cronies), and formed a so-called "Wang Family Courtyard" feudal small clique, excluding progressive workers.

In August of last year, the Fushun Mining Bureau discovered some loopholes in their work and sent people to inspect. Jiang Bo and Liu Shen ordered their subordinates not to report the true situation. Liu Shen and Wang Hengde secretly planned to use the reduced working hours to add equipment and internal repair costs to "ambush" the superiors. Later, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Northeast Bureau sent people to inspect three times before the problem was clarified.

From the above facts, the mistakes of Jiang Bo, Liu Shen, and other leading cadres of the Fushun Machine Repair Plant are extremely serious. This is a serious political error, an intolerable violation of law and discipline. The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's Discipline Inspection Commission, with the approval of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northeast Bureau, decided to expel speculator Wang Hengde from the Party; to give Director Jiang Bo and Deputy Director Liu Shen a serious warning within the Party and recommended that the administration dismiss them from their posts; and to dismiss Du Qingyu from his post as Secretary of the General Branch.

    抚顺机修厂领导干部违法乱纪受到处分
    国营抚顺机修厂厂长江波（共产党员）、副厂长刘燊（共产党员）在管理社会主义性质的企业中长期采取资本主义的经营方法发生了一连串的违法乱纪的错误。他们对上谎报成绩，对下欺骗打击，沽名钓誉，假造劳动模范，制造落后定额，敲诈兄弟厂矿，骗取高额利润，使党和国家在政治上、经济上遭受了不可弥补的损失。
    社会主义性质的企业的生产管理，是建筑在工人阶级的劳动积极性和创造性的基础上的。作为国营企业的领导者，应该依靠和发挥职工群众的热忱和智慧，不断地提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本，为国家超额地创造和积累财富。这就是我们管理社会主义性质的国营企业的根本方法。但江波和刘燊却根本违反了这一原则，他们为了取得本单位的非法利润，在管理生产中，竟长期有意识、有计划地多估工时，多估工料。而且多估的比例有加无已。一九五零年一月至八月，估计的工时比实际工时高百分之五点零四，九月到十二月则多估百分之十四点三八。一九五一年一月到八月估计工时比实际工时高百分之十七点四五，九月到十二月则高出百分之六十五点八四，一九五二年上半年估计工时则高于实际工时百分之七十点九九。最高的甚至比实际工时要多两三倍。为了使估工员顺从他们，江波、刘燊曾几次对那些不肯多估的人员进行批评。说“估工过低会赔钱”。在估料方面也是这样。如去年一月至六月，铸铁件估料中，对砂箱用铁水估为五万二千五百四十公斤，实际只需一万九千四百九十七公斤。
    由于过高的估工估料，就造成了一种假象：表面看起来似乎提高了劳动效率和节省了原料，而实际上，却造成很大的浪费，并且掩盖了生产任务一贯不能完成的真相。去年九月份还有一九五一年的工程八十件原封未动。其次由于估料过多便积存了一些“黑料”，出了废品，就可以用黑料顶上。如“劳动模范”富光斗班，一次就马马虎虎报销硬质合金刀二百多把。第三，由于多估工时，在工资问题上也造成了严重错误，有些没有完成任务、大量出废品的工人，也得到了很多超额奖励。如去年二月份分配给铸铁车间的一批任务是二十二万四千八百零九公斤，实际工时为九千九百二十六工时，车间估工是一万五千六百四十五工时。以后，该车间只完成了十九万一千八百零八公斤，很显然产量没有完成，但工人还得到等于五千七百一十九个工时的超额奖金。机械车间第四班去年二月份所得超额奖金为基本工资的百分之一百零四。这种超额奖金又是“大家分肥”，不是多劳多得，这就完全歪曲了国家的工资政策。
    他们为了掩盖违法行为，隐蔽虚假的定额，去年六月份曾指示车间按厂估计的工时削减百分之三十，但是怕被工人知道，他们就叫各车间先后建立了两套估工卡片制度，一真一假；明账对上，暗账对下，这样来欺骗上级和本厂的工人。
    他们对待兄弟厂矿委托的机械修配和加工，以各种各样恶劣的欺骗手段诈取高额利润：（一）将误作工程的工料费加在其它工程内。如人造石油厂订制水轮，验收时因不合格未收，他们把重作的工料费加在零件锅炉的工料内，名曰“本体费”，结果使人造石油厂订制一台水轮出了两台的钱。（二）随便要“急件费”。制钢厂订制某种钢锭模及保温帽，约定分四期交货，但已过期半年仅完成百分之三十。当制钢厂催促时，反索取百分之二十的加急费。（三）虚报工种、工序。有一个单位向他订制了某项工程，本来不用模型、铸铁、合金等工时，但计算成本时都给加进去了。（四）凭空“追加工时”。某单位订制某项工程时，原估铆焊是八千九百零两个工时，而实际工时是四千二百九十一个，最后反而给追加二十八个工时。（五）把废品卖给兄弟厂矿。（六）漫天要价。给胜利矿做煤溜子成本是三亿，但要价十三亿，完工后还追加工时。
    他们长期以胡弄的态度对待产品质量，如技术科长王恒德提议用冷铸办法制造钢锭模子，经试制结果很不耐用。但王恒德和副厂长刘燊等却坚持用冷铸办法大量生产，使五百七十五个产品都成了废品，损失二十余亿元。又如制造某项产品，没有硬钢料，就以软钢代替，沾不上火，就用青酸加里沾火，只求表面硬度够，其实一用就弯。
    为了本单位和个人的虚荣，江波、刘燊和党总支书记杜庆余等不择手段地“培养劳动模范”。去年该厂选出了九个市一级的劳动模范，就有四个不够条件。其中有个名叫富光斗的，品质极端恶劣，曾在国民党军队中做过通讯连的班长，长期隐瞒历史。在工厂里搞小集团，打击进步工人，虚报成绩。但是，该厂总支书记杜庆余竟把他评为东北大行政区级的劳动模范（因“三反”运动开始，东北总工会未开会研究，因此还不能成为东北大行政区级的劳动模范），给富光斗班配上全套苏联新车床，挑选得力工人到富光斗班去做工。杜庆余要求全厂党、行政、工会、青年团在工作计划和总结上，都把支持与“培养”富光斗班作为重点。他威胁工会主席说：“如果富光斗班垮了，工会要负责任。”他在党和群众团体的干部会议上说：“如果富光斗班垮了，不仅工会要负责任，青年团也要负责任。”这在群众中造成了极坏的影响。
    江波、刘燊等不仅在管理生产上犯了上述一系列的错误，而且在提拔干部中也严重地违背了党的“德才兼备”的政策。例如他们把一个善于阿谀奉迎、品质恶劣的王恒德，提拔为技术科长，并准备提升为副厂长（但抚顺矿务局未予批准）。结果让这个坏分子利用职权拉拢私人，安插亲信（经他提拔的铆焊、铸铁、木型三个车间主任，都是他的亲信），并组成所谓“王家大院”封建小集团，排斥进步的工人。
    去年八月抚顺矿务局发现了他们工作中的一些漏洞，曾派人去检查，江波、刘燊竟布置下面人员不准反映真实情况。刘燊并与王恒德秘密计划利用削减下来的工时，做增添设备和内修费用，向上级
    “打埋伏”，后来经中共中央东北局派人去检查了三次才把问题弄清。
    从上述事实看来，抚顺机修厂的领导干部江波、刘燊等的错误是极其严重的。这是一种严重的政治错误，是一种不可容忍的违法乱纪的行为。中共抚顺市委纪律检查委员会经东北局纪律检查委员会批准，对投机分子王恒德予以开除党籍的处分；对厂长江波、副厂长刘燊给予党内开当从警告的处分，并建议行政上予以撤职处分；对总支书记杜庆余予以撤销总支书记职务的处分。
