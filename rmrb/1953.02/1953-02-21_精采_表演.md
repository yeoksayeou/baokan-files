    “Excellent” Performance
    By Wang Dewei
    On January 25th, the invading U.S. troops in Korea launched what they called "the largest offensive in more than three months" against "Dingzi Mountain." Prior to the offensive, they printed "attack route maps" with colorful covers and invited a group of senior American military officers and journalists to watch the battle. The result was an extremely惨重的惨败. In a fit of rage, the U.S. military replaced the Seventh Division's press officer and prohibited journalists from further interviews.
    "Come, come, watch our 'blitzkrieg' conducted according to schedule, and publicize it vigorously."
    "Get out, get out! There's nothing to see!"

    “精采”表演
    王德威作
    侵朝美军在一月二十五日向“丁字山”发动了自称为“三个多月来最大的一次进攻”的突击战。进攻前印发了彩色封面的“进攻路线图”，还邀请了一群美国高级军官和新闻记者观战，结果失败得极为惨重。在恼羞成怒之下，美军撤换了第七师的新闻发布官，并禁止记者继续采访。
    “来，来，看我们这次按时间表进行的‘突击战’，大力宣传一下。”
    “滚开，滚开！没有什么可瞧的！”
