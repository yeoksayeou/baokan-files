Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 15th: Many Indian newspapers have published editorials commenting on Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the closing session of the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    The Urdu daily "Naya Daur" published an editorial on the 11th titled "China - A Symbol of Peace in Asia," stating: "Chairman Mao Zedong's words demonstrate the unshakable will of the Chinese people. The Chinese people demand peace in order to rebuild their country. No force in the world can take away the freedom that the Chinese people have won through arduous struggle. The Chinese people not only have the will to defend peace, but also sufficient strength. The Korean and Chinese people defeated the American imperialist aggressors in Korea, proving that the Chinese people can defeat American imperialism and defend their motherland and peace in Asia, no matter what barbaric actions American imperialism takes."

    The editorial said: "Chairman Mao Zedong's call to oppose American aggression is not only necessary for building a new democratic China and making China prosperous and strong, but also for the freedom and independence of all countries. The American warmongers do not want to end the Korean War; on the contrary, they want to drag the entire Asia into the war. Eisenhower's recent actions specifically demonstrate this fact. The American imperialists are the common enemy of the Asian people's struggle for freedom. The Asian people oppose the American warmongers and oppose war. They demand peace. The People's Republic of China stands together with the Asian people in defending peace. It is the responsibility of the Indian people to support China in defending peace in Asia. If all the people of Asia declare that they will not allow war to spread in Asia, the American warmongers will not dare to take any action in this regard."

    The editorial pointed out: "Chairman Mao Zedong's speech proves that the Chinese people will continue to resolutely fight for the defense of their freedom and peace, whether on the battlefield or in the armistice negotiations. They will thoroughly crush the sinister intentions of the American warmongers. Chairman Mao Zedong's speech encouraged the peace-loving people of Asian countries and warned the American warmongers that the Chinese people know how to defend their independence."

    "The Free Press" published an editorial on the 10th welcoming Chairman Mao Zedong's speech. The editorial wrote: Eisenhower has taken office with the sinister intention of expanding the war. Chairman Mao Zedong has responded to his clamor. The editorial said: Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out to the world the inherent fragility of the American aggressors. He described the nature of American imperialism as a "paper tiger," which has undoubtedly been proven on the Korean battlefield. The United States has suffered more than 300,000 casualties, and the American rulers have been met with widespread contempt and revulsion. The editorial condemned Eisenhower's warmongering statements about expanding the war of aggression and pointed out that this statement has caused frustration and internal contradictions among his own allies.

    "The National Herald" published an editorial on the 10th commenting on Chairman Mao Zedong's speech, saying: The Chinese people love peace, but if they are forced to fight, the most powerful and bellicose country in the world is no match for them. The editorial condemned the United States' actions of occupying Taiwan and making itself an enemy of the Chinese people, and said: In order to resist America and aid Korea, the Chinese people broke production records. In order to help themselves, they will create miracles of resistance and recovery. The Americans are intent on supporting Chiang Kai-shek and other scum, but their fleets and atomic bombs cannot change the course of the Chinese revolution; the Chinese revolution has already taken shape, and Chiang Kai-shek and his army will inevitably collapse once they encounter it.

    印度报纸重视毛主席在政协会议上的讲话
    【新华社新德里十五日电】许多印度报纸发表社论，评论毛泽东主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议闭幕会上的讲话。
    乌尔都文日报“新世纪”十一日以“亚洲的和平标志——中国”为题发表社论说：“毛泽东主席的话，表示出中国人民不可动摇的意志。中国人民要求和平，以重新建设他们的国家。世界上没有任何力量能够夺取中国人民经过艰苦斗争而得到的自由。中国人民不止有保卫和平的意志，也有足够的力量。朝、中人民在朝鲜打败了美帝国主义侵略者，证明了中国人民能够打败美帝国主义，能够保卫他们的祖国和亚洲的和平，不管美帝国主义采取什么野蛮的行动。”
    社论说：“毛泽东主席的反对美国侵略的号召，不仅对于建设新的民主中国、使中国繁荣富强是必要的，而且对于各国的自由和独立也是必要的。美国战争贩子并不要结束朝鲜战争，相反地，他们想使整个亚洲卷入战争中。艾森豪威尔最近的行动，就具体地证明了这个事实。美帝国主义者是亚洲人民争取自由的斗争的公敌。亚洲人民反对美国战争贩子，反对战争。他们要求和平。中华人民共和国和亚洲人民一同保卫着和平。支持中国保卫亚洲和平，是印度人民的责任。如果亚洲全体人民都宣布他们不让战争在亚洲蔓延开来，美国战争贩子就不敢在这方面有所举动。”
    社论指出：“毛泽东主席的讲话证明，中国人民不论是在战场上或者是在停战谈判中，将继续坚决地为保卫他们的自由与和平而斗争。他们将彻底粉碎美国战争贩子的罪恶意图。毛泽东主席的讲话鼓励了亚洲各国爱好和平的人民，并且给美国战争贩子以警告：中国人民是知道如何捍卫他们的独立的。”
    “自由报”在十日发表社论，对毛泽东主席的讲话表示欢迎。社论写道：艾森豪威尔怀着扩大战争的罪恶意图上了台。毛泽东主席已经对他的叫嚣作了答复。社论说：毛泽东主席曾给全世界指明了美国侵略者的内在的脆弱性。他把美帝国主义的特性形容为一只“纸老虎”，这在朝鲜战场上毫无疑问地被证实了。美国伤亡三十万人以上，美国统治者遭到普遍的鄙视和唾骂。社论斥责艾森豪威尔的扩大侵略战争的好战声明，并指出这个声明已在他自己的盟友中引起沮丧和内部矛盾。
        “国民先驱报”在十日发表社论，评论毛泽东主席的讲话说：中国人民爱好和平，可是如果他们被迫作战，世界上最强大、最黩武的国家也不是他们的敌手。社论斥责美国侵占台湾、与中国人民为敌的行动，并且说：为了抗美援朝，中国人打破了生产纪录。为了自助，他们将创造抵抗和恢复的奇迹。美国人一心要扶植蒋介石以及其他的败类，但是他们的舰队和原子弹是改变不了中国革命的进程的；中国革命已经形势确定，蒋介石和他的军队一旦遇到它，必然会土崩瓦解。
