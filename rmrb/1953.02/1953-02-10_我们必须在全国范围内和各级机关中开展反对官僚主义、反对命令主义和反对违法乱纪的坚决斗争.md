Comrade Chairman, esteemed members, and comrades:

Now, on behalf of the State Council's Committee for the Practice of Economy and the Central Committee's Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party, I will give the conference a brief report on the progress of the nationwide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and the situation of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification work.

The "Three-Anti" campaign has achieved a great victory nationwide. The "Three-Anti" campaign at the central, greater administrative region, provincial (municipal), and special district levels started successively between January and February 1952, and ended successively between June and July. The "Three-Anti" campaign in county-level organs was partly carried out and concluded simultaneously with the "Three-Anti" campaign in the four levels above the special district level; the other part was postponed to around the autumn harvest of 1952 due to the busy spring plowing season, and was carried out using methods such as reorganizing teams or holding cadre meetings. It was completely completed by the end of October 1952.

The total number of people participating in the "Three-Anti" campaign in organs above the county level nationwide was more than 3,836,000. More than 105,000 people were found to have embezzled more than 10 million yuan, accounting for about 2.7 percent of the total number of participants. Those with minor acts of corruption were also exposed and educated during the campaign.

The "Three-Anti" campaign basically eliminated the phenomenon of corruption, severely curbed the phenomenon of waste, and also dealt a powerful blow to bureaucratic tendencies in state organs. Therefore, this movement purified state organs, raised the awareness of staff, helped improve work style, strengthened the ties between the people's government and the people, and changed the social atmosphere. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements played an important role in fundamentally improving the state's financial and economic situation.

The situation in district-level organs is different from that in organs above the county level. The characteristics of district-level organs are decentralization, small staff size, and weak leadership. Therefore, it is inappropriate to carry out the "Three-Anti" campaign at the district level. Some district-level organs carried out the "Three-Anti" campaign at the same time as the organs above the county level. As a result, significant deviations occurred, affecting rural production. In view of this situation, it was decided to stop the "Three-Anti" campaign in district-level organs so that leading organs could free up their hands and, during the slack farming season, use methods such as intensive training of cadres, inspection and summary of work, and reorganization of teams to solve the problems that the "Three-Anti" campaign was intended to solve. This work was basically completed by the end of last year.

As for the problem of rectifying the ideology and work style of village cadres, the method used for the "Three-Anti" campaign in government organs cannot be adopted. In February and March of last year, some villages spontaneously launched the "Three-Anti" campaign, causing great chaos in rural areas, creating unease among the masses, and almost bringing all work to a standstill. Therefore, we had to resolutely stop the "Three-Anti" campaign in rural areas. However, there are indeed many serious problems among village cadres that must be resolved using appropriate methods. What methods should be used? The methods are: first, like district-level cadres, implement intensive training for village cadres; second, combine the tasks of the "Three-Anti" campaign with the task of the Chinese Communist Party to rectify grassroots organizations, and solve the "Three-Anti" problems in the process of party rectification. In all villages with existing CCP organizations, the second method is the primary method.

Here, I need to introduce the CCP Central Committee's decision on rectifying the party's grassroots organizations.

In March 1951, the Chinese Communist Party convened the First National Organizational Work Conference, at which a resolution was made to rectify the party's grassroots organizations. The conference decided to conduct a planned, prepared, and led general rectification of all the party's grassroots organizations within three years. The steps of party rectification include training cadres, conducting a general education for party members on how to be a Communist Party member, conducting typical experiments in party rectification, and then implementing a general review of party members in the party's grassroots organizations, eliminating bad elements who have infiltrated the party, and persuading those who do not meet the conditions of a party member and who have not been effectively educated to withdraw from the party organization. In order to do a good job in party rectification, we have made long-term preparations. From the winter of 1951 to before the winter of 1952, a total of 100,000 party rectification cadres were trained, and experiments were conducted in 12,000 rural branches. With these preparations, we launched a large-scale party rectification movement in the winter of 1952. Now the first batch—the rectification work of 40,000 rural branches—has been completed one after another, and some places have begun to carry out the second batch of rural branch party rectification work.

The experience of party rectification in the past two years has proved that the vast majority of members of the Chinese Communist Party meet the conditions of a Communist Party member. After rectification, an average of about 90 percent of party members are reviewed as meeting the conditions of a party member, and about 10 percent do not meet the conditions of a party member. Among these 10 percent, various bad elements who have been expelled from the party account for about 3 to 5 percent; members who have recognized themselves as not meeting the conditions of a party member after education and are willing to withdraw from the party, as well as those who are passive and backward, who have lost the conditions of a party member and are advised to leave the party, account for about 5 to 7 percent. The various bad elements who have been expelled from the party include: those who oppress the masses and violate laws and discipline, those who have degenerated, landlord and rich peasant elements, those who harbor counter-revolutionaries and lose their stand, and counter-revolutionary elements. The result of party rectification is that the party organization is purified, the awareness of party members is raised, and the ties between the party and the masses are strengthened. This is a major gain. However, only a small portion of the 180,000 rural party branch organizations nationwide have been rectified, and all will not be completely rectified until the spring of 1954.

The experience of rectifying rural party branches shows that although there are also problems of corruption and waste among rural party members, the danger in this regard is greatly reduced due to the unification of rural finances. The most serious problems in rural areas are the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Therefore, the CCP Central Committee has decided to focus on solving the problems of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in the process of party rectification, and also incidentally solve the problems of corruption and waste. All those who seriously violate laws and discipline or who have caused serious crimes due to bureaucracy or commandism must be eliminated in the process of party rectification and given appropriate punishment by the government according to the circumstances.

The result of party rectification, although proving that the vast majority of grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party are good, and the vast majority of our village governments and village staff are good, also reveals that wherever bureaucrats, commandists, and violators of law and discipline are in power, various evils will occur. We must not think that these evils are not extremely serious problems just because they are not universal, and we cannot relax in the slightest. The prominent evils are manifested in commandism and violations of law and discipline, while the main evil of bureaucracy is turning a blind eye to the phenomena of commandism and violations of law and discipline, and even shielding them. Our task is to resolutely open fire on these three evils at the same time.

The Chinese Communist Party basically relies on explaining and persuading the people to carry out its work. This is the basic viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism regarding the relationship between the Party and the people. However, commandist elements in rural areas treat almost every task as an assignment to be distributed, and then use various crude methods to force its completion after the assignment. They not only use coercive orders in the work of collecting public grain and mobilizing migrant workers, but also in agricultural production, patriotic health campaigns, and other work that directly benefits the masses. For example, in Shandong, during the well-drilling and drought-resistance campaign, some district and township cadres in Tai'an, Jiaozhou, Wendeng, and other areas assigned tasks to households according to the number of people, arbitrarily drew circles on the masses' land, and forced the masses to drill wells according to the circles. Some assigned militia to stand guard, concentrating all the residents of the village to force them to drill wells. Some even suddenly sealed off market towns and detained the masses going to the market to force them to drill wells. Most of the wells drilled in this way are unusable. In Zhucheng County, more than 20,000 wells were drilled, but less than 5,000 could be used, and less than 300 have been used. For example, in the work of promoting superior varieties, Sishui and other places assigned superior varieties to households only after farmers had planted small cotton, forcing the masses to hoe out the planted small cotton. Those who were unwilling to hoe were beaten by the township head. Cangshan County even forced the masses to pull out more than 490 acres of cotton when the cotton was already fruiting and about to be harvested. Such things are not only in Shandong, but in many places. Similar situations have occurred in Hebei and Rehe, such as forced well-drilling. Due to forced orders, 5,416 wells were drilled in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, in 1952, but only more than 1,000 had water; 70,000 wells were drilled in the Tianjin area, but 40,000 were unusable.

The evils of those who violate laws and discipline go even further. They beat and scold the masses, arbitrarily arrest and detain people, interfere with freedom of marriage, persecute those who criticize them, frame good people, and even shield counter-revolutionary elements, rape women, force people to death, and beat people to death.

The existence of these phenomena seriously endangers the interests of the masses, causes great suffering to the masses, and damages the ties between the Party and the government and the people. This is a very serious problem and should arouse our great attention.

Obviously, this is an extremely bad anti-people work style, which is absolutely incompatible with the interests of the people, the interests of the country, and the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. In terms of its social roots, this work style is the reactionary work style of the reactionary ruling class towards the people, which is the reflection of the remnants of the Kuomintang work style in our Party and government. Fighting this bad work style is not only a big problem at present, but also a big problem for a considerable period in the future.

The existence of this work style is directly related to the impure composition and impure ideological work style of many lower-level organizations and lower-level cadres. Therefore, we must focus on educating party members to overcome this work style in the process of party rectification, and eliminate the worst representatives of this work style. However, it would be completely wrong to think that this is only a lower-level problem without first examining the leadership responsibility of the upper levels. The serious existence of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in lower-level organizations is closely related to the bureaucratic work style of the higher-level leading organs. Many staff members in leading organs do not understand the real situation at the lower levels, and do not understand the suffering of the masses. They often do not consider and decide on their work based on objective and practical conditions, but often consider and decide on their work based on inaccurate information, imagination, and wishes. Therefore, the tasks they put forward are often excessive and heavy, and the demands are too urgent, making the lower levels excessively tense and busy, and unable to do their work well. They are only interested in using cadres, and not interested in educating cadres. Therefore, when assigning work, they often only emphasize the completion of tasks, without clearly and specifically explaining the policies to the lower levels, clarifying the boundaries between what should be done and what should not be done, and without clearly and specifically explaining the work style and work methods. After assigning work, they rarely conduct inspections, and are satisfied with the superficial achievements reported by the lower levels, without paying attention to the actual effect of the work; or they only see the good aspects of the work, but not the bad aspects; or they only pursue quantity, but do not pay attention to quality. They often turn a blind eye to various serious phenomena that harm the interests of the people, and therefore do not take active measures to support good people, punish bad people, promote good deeds, and eliminate bad deeds. All of this has fueled the coercive command work style of district and township cadres, spoiled many good things, and allowed many lawless and undisciplined bad people to find a hiding place, causing losses to the interests of the people. The higher-level leading organs I am talking about refer to the central-level organs, greater administrative region-level organs, provincial (municipal)-level organs, special district-level organs, and county-level organs of the Party and government. There is a lot of bureaucracy in these five levels of organs. They only focus on assigning work, but not on inspecting work. Some leading organs have a coercive command work style, and even harbor lawless and undisciplined elements. Speaking of senior leading organs making bureaucratic and commandist mistakes, we can take the recent errors in the work of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the provincial and county postal and telecommunications departments published in the newspaper as an example to illustrate the relationship between the bureaucratic and commandist work style of the leading organs and the bureaucracy and commandism of the lower levels. For example, the recent errors of Huang Yifeng, the former Minister of Communications of East China, published in the newspaper, show that some senior cadres are themselves lawless and undisciplined elements. We should resolutely eliminate any phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in our state organs and Communist Party organizations, whether such phenomena occur at the lower or upper levels, occur more or less.

These problems were not completely resolved in the "Three-Anti" campaign, which is quite natural. This is not only because the main focus of the "Three-Anti" campaign was aimed at corrupt elements, but also because the struggle against bureaucracy is a long-term struggle. Bureaucracy in today's China has a long historical tradition and a broad economic foundation, and will never be eliminated under any one strike. Similarly, the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in rural areas can and must make significant progress in the Chinese Communist Party's party rectification work, but one cannot expect to solve the problem once and for all.

Based on the above facts, we believe that it is absolutely necessary to continue to adhere to the struggle against bureaucracy, and to combine the struggle against bureaucracy with the struggle against coercive orders and against violations of law and discipline. In 1953, we should first start with handling people's letters, inspecting work, educating cadres, and further expanding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, closely combining with party rectification work, general election work, and other tasks, thoroughly exposing the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and launching a sharp struggle against these phenomena. With the further democratization of the country, with the development of the Chinese Communist Party's party rectification work, discipline inspection work, and party education work, with the development of the socialist ideological power of the working class, and especially with the development of socialist industry and cooperative agriculture, these poisonous weeds, which are born from the soil of feudalism, capitalism, and small-commodity economy, will undoubtedly only move towards death day by day. Therefore, I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the broad masses of the people, we will certainly be able to continuously achieve victory in this historic struggle!

    我们必须在全国范围内和各级机关中开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的坚决斗争
    （一九五三年二月七日在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的发言）中央人民政府人事部部长  中共中央组织部副部长  安子文主席，各位委员，各位同志：
    现在我代表政务院节约检查委员会和中共中央组织部，把全国反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的经过和中国共产党整党工作的情况，向大会作一简要的报告。
    “三反”运动已在全国范围内获得了伟大的胜利。中央、大区、省（市）和专署四级的“三反”运动，在一九五二年一、二月间先后开始，六、七月间先后结束。县级机关的“三反”运动，一部分是和专署以上四级机关的“三反”运动同时进行和结束的；另一部分则因春耕农忙，推迟至一九五二年秋收前后，采用整编队伍或召开干部会议的方法进行的。在一九五二年十月底全部结束。
    全国县以上的机关，参加“三反”运动的总人数共为三百八十三万六千多人，共查出贪污一千万元以上的十万五千多人，约占参加“三反”运动总人数的百分之二点七，其余有小贪污行为的人也在运动中受到了揭发和教育。
    “三反”运动基本上消灭了贪污现象，严重地制止了浪费现象，对于国家机关中的官僚主义倾向也给了有力的打击。因此，这个运动纯洁了国家机关，提高了工作人员的觉悟程度，帮助了工作作风的改进，密切了人民政府与人民群众的联系，改变了社会风气。“三反”运动和“五反”运动对于国家财政经济情况的根本好转，起了重要的促进的作用。
    区级机关的情况与县以上机关的情况有所不同。区级机关的特点是分散、人少、领导弱，所以以区为单位开展“三反”运动是不适当的。有一部分区级机关在县以上机关进行“三反”运动的同时，也曾进行过“三反”运动，结果发生了很大偏差，并影响了农村的生产。鉴于这种情况，决定在区级机关中停止“三反”运动，以便领导机关腾出手来，利用农闲，采用集训干部、检查总结工作、整编队伍的方法，解决“三反”运动所要解决的问题。这一工作，已经在去年年底基本上完成了。
    至于整顿乡村干部的思想作风问题，就更不能采用机关“三反”的作法了。去年二、三月间，某些乡村曾经自发地开展了“三反”运动，引起农村很大的混乱，造成群众的不安，几乎使一切工作陷于停顿状态。因此，我们就不得不坚决制止农村中的“三反”运动。但在乡村干部中的确存在着不少严重的问题，必须采用妥善的办法加以解决。用什么办法呢？办法就是：第一、和区级干部一样，实行集训乡村干部；第二、把“三反”运动的任务和中国共产党整顿基层组织的任务结合起来，在整党的过程中解决“三反”的问题。在一切已有中共组织的乡村，第二种办法是主要的办法。
    在这里，我需要把中共中央关于整顿党的基层组织的决定介绍一下。
    一九五一年三月，中国共产党召集了第一次全国组织工作会议，在这个会议上作出了整顿党的基层组织的决议。这个会议决定在三年内对党的全部基层组织进行一次有计划、有准备、有领导的普遍的整理。整党的步骤包括训练干部，对党员普遍进行一次怎样做一个共产党员的教育，进行整党的典型试验，然后实行在党的基层组织中进行普遍的审查党员，清除混入党内的坏分子，劝告党内不够党员条件而又教育无效的人退出党的组织。为了做好整党工作，我们曾进行了长期的准备。自一九五一年冬季开始到一九五二年冬季以前，共调训整党干部十万人，曾在一万二千个农村支部中进行了试验。由于有了这样一些准备，所以在一九五二年冬季我们就开展了大规模的整党运动，现在第一批——四万个农村支部的整顿工作已陆续结束，有些地方已开始进行第二批农村支部的整党工作。
    过去两年整党的经验证明：中国共产党的党员绝大部分是合于共产党员的条件的。经过整理的党组织，平均约有百分之九十的党员被审查为合于党员条件，约有百分之十左右的人不合于党员条件。在这百分之十中间，被开除党籍的各种坏分子约占百分之三到百分之五；经过教育自认不够党员条件而愿意退党的分子以及消极落后、丧失党员条件而被劝告出党的分子约占百分之五到百分之七。在被开除党籍的各种坏分子中，包括：欺压群众违法乱纪的分子、蜕化变质的分子、地主富农分子、包庇反革命丧失立场的分子以及反革命分子。整党的结果是使得党的组织纯洁，党员的觉悟程度提高，党与群众的联系密切。这是一个重大的收获。但全国十八万个农村党的支部组织，现在还只是整顿了一小部分，要到一九五四年春才全部整顿完毕。
    整顿农村党的支部的经验表明：在农村党员中，虽也有贪污浪费的问题，但是由于乡村财政的统一，这方面的危险是大大减少了。农村中最严重的问题是官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。因此中共中央决定在整党的过程中着重解决官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的问题，同时也附带解决贪污浪费的问题。凡是严重的违法乱纪分子或是由于官僚主义、命令主义而造成严重罪恶的分子，必须在整党中加以清除，并按照情况，由政府给以适当的惩处。  
     整党的结果，虽然证明中国共产党的绝大部分基层组织是好的，我们的乡村政权和乡村工作人员绝大部分是好的，但是同时也发现了，凡在官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪分子掌权的地方，就会发生种种为非作歹的罪恶。我们决不能因为这些罪恶并不普遍就不认为是极严重的问题，就可以有丝毫的放松。突出的罪恶是表现在命令主义和违法乱纪方面，而官僚主义的主要罪恶就是对于命令主义、违法乱纪的现象熟视无睹，甚至加以包庇。我们的任务是坚决向这三种罪恶同时开火。
    中国共产党基本上是依靠向人民群众解释说服来进行工作的，这是马克思列宁主义关于党与人民群众的关系的基本观点。可是在乡村中的命令主义分子却几乎把每件工作都当成任务来摊派，并在摊派了任务之后用各式各样的粗暴办法去强迫完成。他们不仅在征收公粮、动员民工等项工作中采用强迫命令办法，而且在农业生产、爱国卫生运动等直接给群众利益的工作中也采用这种错误办法。例如山东，在打井抗旱运动中，泰安、胶州、文登等地区，有的区、乡干部给群众按户分配任务，到群众地中任意划圈，强迫群众照圈打井，有的指派民兵站岗，将全村居民集中强迫打井，甚至有的突然封锁集镇，扣留赶集群众打井。这样强迫打成的井多数不能用。诸城县共打井两万多眼，能用者不足五千，已用者不到三百。再如在推广优良品种工作中，泗水等地在农民已种上小棉后才将优良品种摊派到户，强迫群众锄去已种的小棉，不愿锄者即遭乡长捆打。苍山县甚至当棉花已结桃，即将丰收之际，还强迫群众拔了四百九十多亩棉花。这样的事情，并不只是山东有，而是很多地方都有的。像强迫打井的事情，热河、河北就都有类似的情形。由于强迫命令，河北宁晋县一九五二年打井五千四百十六眼，只有一千多眼有水；天津专区打井七万眼，有四万眼不能用。
    违法乱纪分子的罪恶更进一步。他们打骂群众，乱捕乱押，干涉婚姻自由，对批评者施行迫害，诬陷好人，甚至包庇反革命分子，强奸妇女，逼死人和打死人。
    这些现象的存在，严重地危害了群众的利益，造成群众的极大痛苦，破坏了党和政府与人民群众的联系。这是一个非常严重的问题，应该引起我们极大的重视。
    很显然，这是一种极恶劣的反人民的作风，是和人民的利益、国家的利益和中国共产党的利益绝不相容的。这种作风就它的社会根源来讲，就是反动统治阶级对待人民的反动作风，也就是国民党作风的残余在我们党和政府内的反映。和这种坏作风进行斗争，不仅在目前是一个大问题，而且在今后一个相当长的时期内，也将是一个大问题。
    这种作风的存在，与很多下层组织、下层干部成分不纯和思想作风不纯是有直接关系的。因此，我们要在整党过程中着重教育党员克服这种作风，并且把这种作风的最坏的代表者清除出去。但是如果以为这只是下层的问题，而不首先从上层的领导责任来检查，那就完全错了。下层组织中的官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪现象的严重存在，首先与上级领导机关的官僚主义作风有密切关系。不少领导机关中的工作人员不了解下边的真实情况，不了解群众的痛苦。他们往往不是从客观的实际条件出发，来考虑和决定他们的工作，而往往是从不确切的情况出发，从想像和愿望出发，来考虑和决定他们的工作。因此，他们提出的任务往往过多过重，而且要求过急，使下边过度地紧张、忙碌，而不能做好工作。他们只对使用干部有兴趣，而对教育干部没有兴趣，因而在布置工作的时候，往往只强调要完成任务，而不明确具体地向下边交代政策，划清该作的事情和不该作的事情的界限，不明确具体地交代工作作风和工作方法。他们在布置工作之后又很少进行检查，满足于下边报告的表面成绩，而不注意工作的实际效果；或者只看到工作中好的方面，看不到工作中坏的方面；或者只追求数量，不讲究质量。他们往往对各种危害人民利益的严重现象熟视无睹，因而不采取积极的办法去支持好人，惩治坏人，发扬好事，消灭坏事。所有这一切，就助长了区、乡干部的强迫命令作风，把很多好事办坏，并使很多违法乱纪的坏人得到藏身之所，使人民群众的利益遭到损失。我所说的上级领导机关，是指党和政府的中央一级机关、大行政区一级机关、省（市）一级机关、专区一级机关和县级机关，这五级机关内都有不少的官僚主义，它们只注重布置工作，不注重检查工作。有些领导机关则有强迫命令的作风，甚至包藏有违法乱纪分子。说到高级领导机关犯有官僚主义和命令主义的错误，我们可举最近报纸上发表的中央邮电部及省、县邮电部门工作中的错误为例，就可以说明领导机关的官僚主义和命令主义作风与下边的官僚主义与命令主义的关系。又如最近报纸上发表的前华东交通部部长黄逸峰的错误，说明有些高级干部自己就是违法乱纪分子。我们应当坚决扫除我们的国家机关中和共产党组织中的任何官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪现象，无论这种现象是发生在下级或上级，发生得多或发生得少。
    这些问题在“三反”运动中并没有完全解决，这是很自然的。这不但是因为“三反”运动的主要锋芒是针对着贪污分子，而且因为反对官僚主义的斗争是一个长时期的斗争，官僚主义在今天的中国有它的长久的历史传统和广泛的经济基础，决不是在任何一次打击之下就会消灭的。同样，在乡村中反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，可以而且必须在中国共产党的整党工作中得到重大的进展，但是决不能指望由此一劳永逸。
    根据上述的事实，我们认为完全有必要把反对官僚主义的斗争继续坚持下去，并把反对官僚主义的斗争与反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪的斗争结合起来。在一九五三年内，首先应该从处理人民来信、检查工作、教育干部并在报纸上进一步展开批评和自我批评入手，与整党工作、普选工作以及其他各项工作密切结合，彻底揭发官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，向这些现象展开尖锐的斗争。随着国家的进一步的民主化，随着中国共产党整党工作、纪律检查工作和党的教育工作的发展，随着工人阶级的社会主义思想威力的发展，特别是随着社会主义工业和合作化农业的发展，这些由封建主义、资本主义和小商品经济的土壤里生出来的毒草，无疑是只会一天天走向死亡的。因此，我坚决相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在全国广大人民的支持下，我们一定能够在这个历史性的斗争中不断地取得胜利！
