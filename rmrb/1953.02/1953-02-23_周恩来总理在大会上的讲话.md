Comrade Ambassador, Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers! Comrades Officers and Generals!

On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the great Soviet Army, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, I extend warm congratulations to the heroic and invincible Soviet Army and express deep respect to the creator of the Soviet Army—the great Marshal Stalin.

The Chinese people have watched with great concern the arduous, heroic, and victorious path taken by the Soviet Army. During the Great Patriotic War, the heroic Soviet Army, under the leadership of the brilliant commander Comrade Stalin, after four years of bloody battles, finally annihilated the most elite Nazi army and the armies of its satellite countries in the capitalist world, liberated the countries and peoples of Southeast Europe ravaged by the Hitlerite bandits, and thus achieved the complete victory of the anti-Fascist war. This historic victory greatly encouraged the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who were then engaged in arduous struggle.

After crushing the military strength of fascist Germany, the Soviet Army, with the force of a thunderbolt, turned its guns eastward and annihilated the elite of Japanese imperialism—the Kwantung Army—in northeastern China. This promoted the final victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the complete victory of World War II. The Chinese people will never forget the great assistance given to the Chinese people by the Soviet Army in the struggle to defeat Japanese imperialism.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has brought the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples into a new stage of development. In February 1950, under the personal initiative and auspices of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great China and the Soviet Union concluded the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other relevant agreements. Since then, the Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been linked together in the task of "jointly preventing the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other countries that may collude with Japan in aggressive acts in any form." Comrades! For three years, you have been far away from your motherland, defending the peace and security of China and the Far East together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese people deeply thank you for this great, selfless, and righteous cooperation and assistance. For this reason, Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese government have specially sent us to organize a delegation of the Central People's Government to Lushunkou to express sincere thanks and cordial greetings to you—the heroic Soviet Army comrades.

Now the American aggressors are trying to prolong and expand the Korean War. The American air force invading Korea continues to harass Northeast China, sending special agent planes to invade Chinese Northeast airspace for strategic reconnaissance and continuing to wage barbaric germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. The American aggressors also continue to occupy Taiwan and are instigating and assisting the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in attempting to disrupt China. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea must be further strengthened. We want peace, but as long as U.S. imperialism does not abandon its unreasonable demands and its conspiracy to expand aggression, the Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Korean people. ...
To fight until U.S. imperialism is willing to stop, until the Chinese and Korean people have won complete victory."

Under the manipulation of the American aggressors, the Japanese Yoshida government has consistently refused to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty and has concluded a unilateral peace treaty with the United States and several other countries; the American aggressors, using this unilateral peace treaty and various related agreements subsequently signed with the Japanese Yoshida government, are accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism, wanting to make Japan completely a military base and colony of the United States. This war policy and aggressive policy of the U.S. government seriously threaten the peace and security of China and the Far East. In view of this new situation, on September 15, 1952, China and the Soviet Union, based on the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China, decided to extend the deadline for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the jointly used Chinese Lushunkou naval base as stipulated in Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Lushunkou, until a treaty of peace is concluded between the People's Republic of China and Japan and between the Soviet Union and Japan.

As everyone knows, the Lushunkou area has historically been a bridgehead for imperialists to attack Northeast China and is a strategically important area. Under the current circumstances, the presence of Soviet troops in the Lushunkou area is of paramount importance in deterring and combating any aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. Heroic Soviet Army comrades! You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Soviet people, you are the soldiers educated by the great Comrade Stalin, you have bravely undertaken, and will continue to bravely undertake, the important responsibility of defending peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people admire and thank you, and the peace-loving people all over the world admire and thank you.

In his telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Stalin said: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world." This truth pointed out by Comrade Stalin has special and practical meaning for the Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will work shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Army to gloriously undertake our common historical mission. We are deeply convinced that the people and armies of the great China and the Soviet Union will certainly be able to successfully complete their tasks in this common struggle.

Like the Soviet Army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army of the people, an army permeated with patriotism and internationalism. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been proud to learn from the Soviet Army. The valuable experiences of the Soviet Army in building the army are an important model for Chinese army building. As a result of learning from the Soviet Union, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made great progress in terms of organization, equipment, technology, and training in the past three years. The great communist construction of the Soviet Union has aroused widespread interest and attention in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Comrade Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are being enthusiastically studied throughout the army.

Starting this year, the People's Republic of China has entered a period of large-scale planned construction. In order to do a good job in national construction, the Chinese people believe that it is necessary to follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and regard humbly learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as one of the primary tasks to promote our national construction. Under the wise call of Comrade Mao Zedong, in coordination with the large-scale national construction work, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has recently launched a vigorous upsurge in earnestly learning from the Soviet Union. The whole army has made the greatest determination to work harder to learn from the Soviet Army, strengthen national defense construction, enrich modern equipment, improve the organizational system, improve various trainings, and strive to build a strong and modern national defense force. I believe that with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the illumination of advanced Soviet experience, China's national defense construction will be successful day by day along with China's economic and cultural construction.

Long live the heroic Soviet Army!
Long live the unbreakable friendship between the great China and the Soviet Union!
Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
Long live Comrade Stalin, the most beloved friend of the Chinese people, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, the standard-bearer of world peace!

### 周恩来总理在大会上的讲话

    周恩来总理在大会上的讲话
    大使同志、战士和士官同志们！军官和将军同志们！
    在伟大的苏联建军三十五周年纪念之际，我谨代表中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席向英勇无敌的苏联军队致以热烈的祝贺，向苏联军队的缔造者——伟大的斯大林大元帅表示深切的敬意。
    中国人民曾经以十分关切的心情注视着苏联军队所走过的艰辛的、英勇的、从胜利走向胜利的道路。在伟大的卫国战争时期，英勇的苏联军队在天才的统帅斯大林同志的领导下，经过四年的血战，终于消灭了资本主义世界中最精锐的纳粹军队及其附庸国的军队，解放了在希特勒匪帮蹂躏下的东南欧国家和人民，从而取得了反法西斯战争的彻底胜利。这一历史性的胜利，曾经大大地鼓舞了当时在艰苦斗争中的中国人民和中国人民解放军。
    苏联军队在粉碎了法西斯德国的军事力量后，紧接着又以雷霆万钧之势，挥戈东向，在中国的东北境内，一举歼灭了日本帝国主义的精锐——关东军，这样就促成了中国人民抗日战争的最后胜利，同时也就取得了第二次世界大战的彻底胜利。苏联军队在击败日本帝国主义的斗争中给予中国人民的巨大援助，中国人民将永志不忘。
    中国人民革命的胜利使中苏两国人民的传统友谊进入了发展的新阶段。一九五○年二月，在斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的亲自倡议和主持之下，伟大的中苏两国缔结了友好同盟互助条约及其他有关协定。自此以后，苏联军队和中国人民解放军就在 “共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”的任务中，联结在一起了。同志们！三年来，你们远离祖国，与中国人民解放军一起，捍卫着中国和远东的和平与安全，中国人民深深地感谢你们这种大公无私、见义勇为的伟大合作和援助。为此，毛泽东主席和中国政府特派我们组织中央人民政府代表团前来旅顺口地区，向你们——英勇的苏联军队同志们，表示真诚的感谢和亲切的慰问。
    现在美国侵略者正在企图延长和扩大朝鲜战争。侵朝的美国空军还在继续不断地袭扰中国的东北，派遣特务飞机侵入中国东北领空进行战略侦察，并向中朝人民继续进行惨无人道的细菌战争。美国侵略军还继续侵占着台湾，并正在指使和协助蒋介石残余匪帮企图对中国进行扰乱。因此，毛泽东同志指出：“抗美援朝的斗争必须继续加强。我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。……
    一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”
    在美国侵略者的操纵下，日本吉田政府一直拒绝缔结全面和约并与美国以及其他若干国家缔结了片面和约；美国侵略者利用这一片面和约及随后与日本吉田政府所签订的各项有关协定，正在加紧复活日本的军国主义，要使日本完全成为美国的军事基地和殖民地。美国政府这种战争政策和侵略政策，严重地威胁着中国和远东的和平与安全。有鉴于这一新的形势的发生，一九五二年九月十五日，中苏两国，根据中华人民共和国政府的提议，就决定将中苏关于旅顺口协定第二条中规定苏联军队自共同使用的中国旅顺口海军根据地撤退的期限予以延长，直至中华人民共和国与日本和苏联与日本之间的和约获致缔结时为止。
    大家都知道，旅顺口地区在历史上是帝国主义者进攻中国东北的桥头堡，是具有战略意义的地区。在目前的形势下，苏联军队驻在旅顺口地区，对于制止和打击帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，就具有头等重要的意义。英勇的苏联军队同志们！你们是伟大的苏联人民的优秀的子弟，你们是伟大的斯大林同志教养出来的战士，你们勇敢地担负了、今后仍将勇敢地担负起保卫远东及世界和平的重大责任。中国人民钦佩和感谢你们，全世界爱好和平的人民也都钦佩和感谢你们。
    斯大林同志在抗日战争胜利七周年纪念日致毛泽东同志的电文中说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”斯大林同志所指出的这个真理，对于苏联军队和中国人民解放军具有特殊现实的意义。中国人民解放军将与苏联军队并肩携手，光荣地担负起我们共同的历史使命。我们深信，伟大的中苏两国的人民和军队，一定能够在这个共同斗争中胜利地完成任务。
    正如苏联军队一样，中国人民解放军是人民的军队，是浸透着爱国主义与国际主义精神的军队。中国人民解放军从来就是以向苏联军队学习为荣的。苏联建军的各项宝贵经验，就是中国建军的重要的榜样。由于学习苏联的结果，中国人民解放军最近三年以来，在编制、装备、技术、训练各方面都有了很大的进步。苏联的伟大的共产主义建设，在中国人民解放军中引起了广泛的兴趣和注意。斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”的经典著作，和在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，全军都在热烈地学习着。
    从今年起，中华人民共和国已经进入大规模的计划建设的时期。为了把国家建设工作做好，中国人民认为，必须遵照毛泽东同志的指示，把虚心学习和运用苏联的先进经验看作是推进我们国家建设工作的首要工作之一。在毛泽东同志这个英明的号召之下，配合着国家大规模建设的工作，中国人民解放军最近已经掀起了一个认真学习苏联的热潮。全军都下了最大决心，要更加努力向苏联军队学习，加强国防建设，充实现代装备，改进编制制度，提高各种训练，为建设一支强大的、现代化的国防军而奋斗。我相信，在苏联援助和苏联先进经验的照耀下，中国的国防建设将随着中国的经济建设和文化建设一天一天的走向成功。
    英勇的苏联军队万岁！
    伟大的中苏两国之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民最敬爱的朋友、全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师、全世界和平的旗手、伟大的斯大林同志万岁！
