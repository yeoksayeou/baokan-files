Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: Guangdong Provincial People's Government Chairman Ye Jianying issued the following protest statement regarding the incident of the Hong Kong British authorities openly and directly plundering China's "Yuqiong" fishing boat remaining in Hong Kong:

The Guangdong Provincial People's Government Aquatic Products Bureau had a total of five fishing boats remaining in Hong Kong. Among them, the "Yujin," "Yuyang," "Yulian," and "Yupu" were successively robbed by the Hong Kong British authorities in collusion with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits by violence on June 12, 1950, and June 13, 1952. On January 31, 1953, the last fishing boat, the "Yuqiong," was blatantly and forcibly robbed by the Hong Kong British authorities by violence. On that day, the Hong Kong British Marine Department dispatched tugboats and speedboats full of armed personnel to berth beside my "Yuqiong" boat. Subsequently, Hong Kong British court bailiff O'Lautie and Mai Can, leading eight sailors, forcibly boarded my boat, unreasonably claiming that they were acting on the orders of the British court to tow the fishing boat away, and coerced our personnel to leave the boat. Huang Zhuangwu, the captain of my "Yuqiong" boat, immediately issued a stern statement that the "Yuqiong" boat was state property of the People's Republic of China, and the Hong Kong British authorities had absolutely no right to interfere, and refused to leave the boat. However, O'Lautie and others were arrogant and brutal, and they violently tore down the national flag on my boat, cut the anchor chain of my boat, and used force to compel the captain and crew of three people to leave the boat, and used a tugboat to forcibly and illegally rob the "Yuqiong."

Regarding the five fishing boat incident, I issued a statement on April 5, 1951, denouncing the Hong Kong British authorities' act of openly protecting U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits from robbing our fishing boats as illegal and unreasonable, and pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities should bear full responsibility for this matter and its consequences. However, the Hong Kong British authorities continued to collude with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and finally robbed all five of our fishing boats remaining in Hong Kong. The Chinese people cannot but feel deeply indignant at this series of barbaric acts by the Hong Kong British authorities, who have shamelessly colluded with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and openly and directly robbed the state property of the People's Republic of China by violence. Therefore, I hereby once again lodge a strong protest with the Hong Kong British authorities, and declare that all these series of acts of openly robbing our state property by the Hong Kong British authorities are illegal and unreasonable, and all the responsibilities and consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the British government.
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: After the Hong Kong British authorities colluded with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits to rob four of the five fishing boats belonging to my Guangdong Provincial People's Government remaining in Hong Kong in 1950 and 1952, they again forcibly robbed the last fishing boat "Yuqiong" remaining in Hong Kong on January 31 this year.

On January 31, the Hong Kong British court secretly announced the unsealing of my fishing boat "Yuqiong," which had been frozen for more than two years. At 12:30 on the same day, the Hong Kong British Marine Department dispatched a tugboat full of armed personnel and the Department's No. 23 speedboat to berth beside my "Yuqiong." Subsequently, Hong Kong British court bailiff O'Lautie and Mai Can, leading eight sailors, forcibly boarded the "Yuqiong," unreasonably claiming that they were acting on the orders of the Hong Kong British court to tow the fishing boat away, and coerced our personnel to leave the boat. Huang Zhuangwu, the captain of my "Yuqiong," immediately presented the letter of appointment from the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and issued a stern statement that the other party had no right to interfere, let alone arbitrarily infringe upon our ships. Unexpectedly, the other party violently tore down the national flag on my boat and forced our personnel to leave the boat. My captain Huang Zhuangwu immediately protested to O'Lautie and others, stating that the "Yuqiong" belonged to the state property of the People's Republic of China, and the Hong Kong British government should be fully responsible for its open robbery. However, O'Lautie and others were arrogant and brutal, and under the supervision of armed personnel, they instructed their eight sailors to cut my boat's anchor chain and used a tugboat to tow my fishing boat. Under these circumstances, my captain and crew of three were all forced to leave the boat, and the "Yuqiong" was forcibly robbed by the Hong Kong British authorities.

Of the five fishing boats belonging to my Guangdong Provincial People's Government Aquatic Products Bureau remaining in Hong Kong, the "Yujin," "Yuyang," and "Yulian" were suddenly robbed by more than 30 U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits headed by Arnold and Song Hengyu on June 12, 1950. At that time, the British water police boat berthed there detained my crew members who reported the crime on the charge of "reporting a false case," and used machine guns to prevent my other crew members from going to rescue, covering up the bandits' robbery of the boat out to sea. Since then, the Hong Kong British authorities not only hindered my remaining "Yupu" and "Yuqiong" boats from clearing customs and returning, but deliberately washed away the crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and acquitted the bandits who robbed the boats. For this reason, Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, issued a solemn statement on April 5, 1951, denouncing the British government's act of openly protecting U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits from robbing our state property as illegal and unreasonable, and the Hong Kong British government should bear full responsibility for this matter and its consequences. However, the Hong Kong British authorities continued to carry out their shameless conspiracy to rob my five fishing boats remaining in Hong Kong. On June 13, 1952, the Hong Kong British court colluded with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits to secretly unseal the "Yupu," and took advantage of the storm to suddenly rob it by violence by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Following this, on January 31 this year, they blatantly and directly robbed the last of my five fishing boats remaining in Hong Kong, the "Yuqiong."

    香港英国当局勾结美蒋匪徒劫夺我渔船
    广东省人民政府叶剑英主席发表抗议声明
    【新华社广州十九日电】广东省人民政府叶剑英主席就香港英国当局公然直接劫夺我国留在香港的渔船“渔琼”号事件，发表抗议声明如下：
    广东省人民政府水产局所有的留在香港的渔船共有五艘，其中“渔晋”、“渔扬”、“渔连”、“渔浦”四艘，已于一九五○年六月十二日及一九五二年六月十三日先后被香港英国当局串通美蒋匪徒以暴力劫走；一九五三年一月三十一日，最后一艘“渔琼”号渔船又被香港英国当局以暴力明目张胆地强行劫去。当日，香港英国海事处以满载武装人员的拖轮及快艇驶泊我“渔琼”号船侧，继有香港英国法院法警长奥路梯及麦参等，率领水手八名，强登我船，无理宣称奉英国法院命令将该渔船拖走，胁迫我方人员离船。我“渔琼”号船长黄壮武当即严正声明，“渔琼”号系属中华人民共和国国家财产，香港英国当局绝对无权干涉，并拒绝离船。但奥路梯等横蛮凶暴，竟以暴力扯下我船上国旗，斩断我船的锚链，以武力迫使我船长及船员共三人全部离船，并用拖船将“渔琼”号强行非法劫走。
    关于五渔船事件，本人曾于一九五一年四月五日发表声明，指斥香港英国当局公然庇护美蒋匪徒劫夺我国渔船的行为是非法的、无理的，并指出香港英国当局应对此事及其后果负全部责任。但香港英国当局仍然继续勾结美蒋匪徒，终于将我国留在香港的五艘渔船全部劫走。对于香港英国当局这种卑鄙无耻地串通美蒋匪徒，公然直接以暴力劫夺中华人民共和国国家财产的一系列蛮横行为，中国人民不能不深感愤怒。为此，本人特向香港英国当局再次提出强硬抗议，并声明：香港英国当局所有这一系列的公然劫夺我国家财产的行为是非法的、无理的，由此引起的全部责任和后果必须由英国政府承担。 【新华社广州十九日电】香港英国当局勾结美蒋匪徒，于一九五○年及一九五二年两次劫夺了我广东省人民政府所属的留港五渔船的四艘之后，复于今年一月三十一日又以武力劫走了我留港的最后一艘渔船“渔琼”号。
    一月三十一日香港英国法院秘密宣判，将冻结达二年多的我渔船“渔琼”号启封。同日十二时半，香港英国海事处以满载武装人员之拖轮及该处第二十三号快艇驶泊我“渔琼”号旁侧，继有香港英国法院法警长奥路梯及麦参等，率领水手八名，强登“渔琼”号轮，无理宣称奉香港英国法院命令将该渔船拖走，胁迫我方人员离船。我“渔琼”号船长黄壮武即出示广东省人民政府之委任令，并严正声明对方无权过问，更不能任意侵犯我国船舶。岂知对方即以暴力扯下我船上国旗，并强迫我方人员离船。我船长黄壮武当即向奥路梯等提出抗议，声明“渔琼”号系属中华人民共和国国家财产，香港英国政府应对其公开劫夺行为负完全责任。但奥路梯等横蛮凶暴，在武装人员监视下，指使其水手八名斩断我船锚链，并用拖船拖动我渔船。在此情况下，我船长、船员共三人即被全部被迫离船，“渔琼”号遂被香港英国当局强行劫去。
    我广东省人民政府水产局所有的留港五艘渔船，其中“渔晋”“渔扬”“渔连”三船在一九五○年六月十二日突被以阿诺、宋亨豫为首的美蒋匪徒三十余人劫走；其时在该处停泊的英国水警轮竟将我报警船员以“报假案”罪名扣押，并以机枪禁止我其他船员前往援救，掩护了匪徒劫船出海。此后，香港英国当局不惟阻挠我劫余的“渔浦”、“渔琼”号结关开回，反而蓄意为美蒋匪徒洗刷罪名，判劫船的匪徒无罪。为此，广东省人民政府叶剑英主席曾于一九五一年四月五日发表郑重声明，指斥英国政府这种公然庇护美蒋匪徒劫夺我国家财产的行为是非法的、无理的，香港英国政府应对此事及其后果负全部责任。但香港英国当局又继续进行其劫夺我留港五渔船的无耻阴谋，竟于一九五二年六月十三日，由香港英国法院勾结美蒋匪徒将“渔浦”号秘密启封，并乘暴风雨之际，突由美蒋匪徒以暴力劫走。继此之后，又于今年一月三十一日明目张胆地直接劫夺我国留港五渔船中的最后一艘“渔琼”号。
