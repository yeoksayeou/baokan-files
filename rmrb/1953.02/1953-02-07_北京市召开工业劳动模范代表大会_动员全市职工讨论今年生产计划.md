    Beijing Holds Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference
    Mobilizing City Workers to Discuss This Year's Production Plan
    [From Our Own Correspondent] The Beijing Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference opened on the 6th at Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park. Five hundred and twenty-one labor model representatives attended. The purpose of the conference is to summarize and exchange experiences in the increased production and conservation campaign, establish advanced banners in industrial production, and then, through the leading, backbone, and bridging roles of labor models, mobilize all workers to discuss the 1953 production plan, thereby launching a new high tide of labor competition and ensuring the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of this year's national economic construction plan.
    In the second half of last year, more than 230,000 workers from state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private enterprises in Beijing launched a patriotic increased production and conservation campaign. By the end of last year, in addition to completing the production plan, they also increased production and saved the country 1,172.9 billion yuan in wealth, completing 146.6 percent of the original increased production and conservation plan. On this basis, grassroots trade unions launched a city-wide campaign to elect labor models. This election campaign, through summarizing work, mobilized the broad masses of workers from top to bottom, and selected model figures recognized by the masses. In the summarizing work, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the broad masses of workers received a profound education. Some model figures who had not been discovered in the past due to the bureaucracy of leading cadres have now been selected. For example, Yan Wancun, a worker at the Mentougou Mechanical and Electrical Plant, in the past, the leadership only knew that he had found many tricks, but did not know how great his contribution was or what advanced experience he had. This election revealed that he had improved the drill bit alone, increasing production efficiency by 29 times and saving wealth worth more than 280,000 catties of millet. This also educated some leading cadres.
    At this conference, in addition to listening to reports from responsible cadres of relevant departments, labor model representatives will also report on advanced experiences, and an award ceremony will be held.

    北京市召开工业劳动模范代表大会
    动员全市职工讨论今年生产计划
    【本报讯】北京市工业劳动模范代表大会，于六日在中山公园中山堂揭幕。出席劳动模范代表五百二十一人。大会的目的是总结并交流增产节约竞赛中的经验，树立工业生产中的先进旗帜，以便通过劳动模范的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，发动全体职工讨论一九五三年的生产计划，进而掀起新的劳动竞赛的高潮，保证完成并超额完成今年的国家经济建设计划。
    去年下半年，北京市国营、地方国营、合作社营、公私合营企业职工二十三万多人，展开了爱国增产节约竞赛运动。到去年年底，除完成生产计划外，还给国家增产节约了一万一千七百二十九亿元的财富，完成原增产节约计划的百分之一百四十六点六。在这个基础上，各基层工会展开了全市规模的评选劳动模范运动。这次评选运动，通过总结工作的方式，自上而下地发动了广大职工群众，评出了为群众公认的模范人物。并在总结工作中展开了批评与自我批评，使广大职工受到了一次深刻的教育。有一些由于过去领导干部的官僚主义而未被发现的模范人物，现在也被评选出来了。如门头沟机电厂工人阎万存，过去领导上只知道他找的窍门很多，但不知道他的贡献究竟有多大，有什么先进经验。这次评选中才发现他仅改进钻头一项，就提高生产效率二十九倍，节约了价值二十八万多斤小米的财富。从而使一些领导干部也受到了教育。
    在这次大会上，除听取有关部门的负责干部报告外，还有劳动模范代表报告先进经验，并举行发奖仪式。
