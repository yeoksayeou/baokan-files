    Shaanxi Nanzheng Special District Cooperative Office
    Misappropriates Cotton Bollworm Control Loans to Hoard Goods for Profit
    Ma Yingtang writes: The Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Union allocated 450 million yuan to the Nanzheng Special District Cooperative Office in the province on June 16 last year for cotton bollworm control, requiring it to be forwarded to farmers. However, after receiving these funds, the office did not promptly lend them to cotton farmers. Instead, it used them to hoard 70,000 jin of wood ear for profit (with profits as high as 60 percent). As a result, when cotton bollworm infestations occurred in one city and twelve counties under the Nanzheng Special District, timely control measures could not be implemented, seriously affecting cotton production and the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers. Some cotton farmers, unable to obtain loans and afford pesticides and equipment, simply pulled out the cotton stalks. After repeated phone calls from the Provincial Cooperative Union urging action, the Nanzheng Special District Cooperative Office finally lent the funds to cotton farmers. However, by this time, the cotton bollworms had already been eradicated. The masses reflected: What's the use of locking the door after the thief is gone! According to incomplete statistics from six counties under the Nanzheng Special District, over 48,600 mu of cotton fields were affected by cotton bollworms, resulting in a loss of approximately 529,300 jin of cotton, worth approximately 42.32 billion yuan. I believe that this practice of the Nanzheng Special District Cooperative Office violates the cooperative's management principles and should be thoroughly investigated.

### 陕西南郑专区合作办事处挪用除治棉虫贷款囤货赚钱

专栏：读者来信摘要

    陕西南郑专区合作办事处
    挪用除治棉虫贷款囤货赚钱
    马映堂来信：陕西省合作社联合社在去年六月十六日拨给该省南郑专区合作办事处治棉虫贷款四亿五千万元，要求转发给农民。但该办事处收到这批款项后，没有及时贷放给棉农，却拿去囤积七万斤木耳牟利（利润高达百分之六十）。结果南郑专区所属一市十二个县发生棉虫害时，不能得到及时除治，严重地影响了棉花产量和棉农的生产情绪。有的棉农因领不到贷款，买不起农药械，就索性把棉杆拔掉。经省合作社联合社几次打电话催问，南郑专区合作办事处才把款贷给棉农。但这时棉虫已经扑灭。群众纷纷反映：贼走了关门有啥用！据南郑专区所属六个县不完全统计：受棉虫危害的棉田共四万八千六百多亩，损失棉花约五十二万九千三百多斤，约值四百二十三亿二千万元。我认为南郑专区合作办事处的这种作法，是违反合作社经营方针的，应作深刻检查。
