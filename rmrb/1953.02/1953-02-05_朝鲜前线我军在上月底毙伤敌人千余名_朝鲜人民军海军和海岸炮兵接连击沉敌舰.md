Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 4th: Fighting on the Korean front was sporadic during the last six days of January. There were more small-scale attacks and ambush battles on the eastern and western fronts, while the central front was relatively quiet.

	On the eastern front, our troops launched three attacks in two days, eliminating a total of 165 enemies. Before dawn on the 26th, our troops quickly captured a position of a puppet army platoon near Zhangxiang, southeast of Changcheng-ri, annihilating most of the defending enemy, totaling 40 men. After dusk and late at night on the 27th, our troops launched two attacks, one at a position of the Li puppet army one kilometer southwest of Kimhwa, capturing the position in ten minutes, eliminating 10 enemies; the other was when our troops captured an American position east of Jiqi Peak, west of Mundok, in a 20-minute battle. Afterwards, they fought fiercely on this position for two hours, repelling six counterattacks by superior enemy forces, killing or wounding 115 enemy soldiers.

	During these six days, our troops annihilated over a hundred enemies in repelling multiple enemy intrusions. There were two larger-scale intrusions by the enemy towards our positions on the western front. One was on the night of the 27th, when about a platoon of the American 7th Division stealthily approached our forward positions near Shixian-dong, southwest of Cheorwon. Our troops launched a simultaneous attack under unified command, ending the battle in just five minutes, eliminating 29 enemies. The other was on the morning of the 29th, when a company of the American 1st Marine Division, under the cover of twelve aircraft and fifteen tanks, fiercely attacked our forward positions near Dongchang-ri, northwest of Munsan. The enemy launched one attack after another, but were all driven back down the mountain by our troops. This battle lasted for twenty minutes, and our troops eliminated over twenty enemies.

	From January 26th to 31st, our mobile artillery fire on the front killed or wounded a total of 765 enemy soldiers. Our anti-aircraft artillery fire on the front shot down or damaged sixteen enemy aircraft each.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 4th: The heroic Korean People's Army Navy and coastal artillerymen have recently dealt heavier blows to the invading enemy from the sea, constantly achieving great victories.

	The warriors of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army Navy, led by Hong Dong-cheol, laid torpedoes in the sea area they were defending, restricting the enemy's invasion activities. As the "February 8th" Army Day of the Korean People's Army was approaching, they shouted the slogan "Welcome the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army with greater victories," and fought bravely against the invading American maritime bandits, sinking two enemy destroyers in two days. The artillery warriors of a certain detachment of the Korean People's Army naval defense forces, led by Li Chang-cheng, sank two enemy destroyers and one minesweeper in the past month, and also damaged two enemy destroyers.

	The artillerymen of the Zhao Song-gil detachment, who victoriously guarded a certain section of the east coast, have sunk sixteen enemy ships since taking over the defense. On December 22, 1952, they sank two enemy ships in one morning battle. At seven o'clock that morning, the coastal artillery gunners spotted an enemy destroyer and a minesweeper sailing towards the coast through the morning mist. Soon, fire flashed from the enemy ships, and the pirates opened fire on the peaceful residents on the coast. The artillerymen, filled with anger, waited until the enemy ships entered the firing range and then began to fire fiercely at them. The first shell landed in front of the bow of the enemy destroyer, stirring up thick columns of water. The American pirates, shocked by this sudden blow, hurriedly turned their guns, attempting to bombard the artillery positions. The Korean People's Army artillerymen, regardless of the enemy's shells exploding around them, stared firmly at the enemy ships, shouting "Sink the enemy ships to the bottom of the sea," and aimed and bombarded them more accurately. They sank the enemy ship with only nine shells. At this time, the minesweeper floating around the destroyer quickly turned around, speeding up and trying to escape. But in the accurate and torrential fire of the gunners, it only escaped a short distance before being sunk.

	The heroic Korean People's Army Navy and coastal artillerymen are determined to further strengthen operations, defend the motherland's seas and coasts, strive for greater victories, and crush any enemy attempts to invade from the sea. The coastal artillerymen of a certain detachment of the People's Army naval defense forces, led by Zhang Zhan-shan, who defended a certain coast, once sank five of eleven enemy ships in a battle against them. The heroic coastal gunners of this detachment expressed their determination to fight this New Year, saying: No matter how frantically the enemy invades our motherland's coast, we will certainly give it a devastating blow!

    朝鲜前线我军在上月底毙伤敌人千余名
    朝鲜人民军海军和海岸炮兵接连击沉敌舰
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】一月份的最后六天，朝鲜前线战斗时断时续，东线和西线小型的袭击、阻击战斗多些，中线战斗比较沉寂。
    东线我军在两天之内出击三次，计歼敌一百六十五名。二十六日黎明前，我军迅速攻占了长承里东南獐项附近伪军一个排的阵地，歼灭守敌大部，计四十名。二十七日黄昏以后和深夜，我军共出击两次，一次在金城西南一公里处，十分钟内即攻入李伪军据守的一处阵地，歼敌十名；另一次是我军在二十分钟的战斗中，攻占了文登以西加七峰东部的一个美军阵地，以后，又在这个阵地上激战两小时，击退了优势敌人的六次反扑，毙伤敌军一百一十五名。
    在这六天中，我军在打退敌人多次的窜扰战斗中共歼敌百余名。敌人向西线我军阵地的窜犯，规模较大的有两次。一次是在二十七日夜，美七师约一个排偷偷摸至铁原西南石岘洞附近的我军阵地前沿。我军在统一号令下同时出击，仅仅打了五分钟便结束战斗，计歼敌二十九名；另一次是在二十九日早晨，美军陆一师的一个连在十二架飞机，十五辆坦克的掩护下向汶山西北东场里附近的我军的前沿阵地猛犯，敌人一次再次地发起冲锋，都被我军打下山去。这场战斗进行了二十分钟，我军共歼敌二十多名。
    一月二十六日到三十一日，前线我军游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军七百六十五名。前线我军高射炮火击落击伤敌机各十六架。
    【新华社平壤四日电】英雄的朝鲜人民军海军和海岸炮兵们最近更加沉重地打击从海上来犯的敌人，不断取得巨大的胜利。
    洪东哲率领的朝鲜人民军海军某部勇士们，在他们防守的海面上敷设了鱼雷，限制了敌舰的侵犯活动。在朝鲜人民军“二·八”建军节快要到来的时候，他们喊出了“以更大战果迎接朝鲜人民军建立五周年”的口号，对进犯的美国海上强盗奋勇作战，在两天当中就打沉了敌驱逐舰两艘。朝鲜人民军海防部队李昌成率领的某区分队的炮兵勇士们，在过去一个月中共打沉了敌驱逐舰两艘和扫雷艇一艘，另外还打伤了敌驱逐舰两艘。
    胜利地扼守着东海岸某一段海岸线的赵松吉所属区分队的炮兵们，自从接防以来，已经打沉了敌人的舰艇十六艘。一九五二年十二月二十二日，他们在一个上午的战斗中，就打沉了敌舰艇两艘。那天早上七点钟，海岸炮兵的炮手们透过晨雾，发现海面上有敌人的一艘驱逐舰和一艘扫雷艇向海岸驶来。不久，敌舰上闪出火光，海贼们又向海岸上的和平居民开炮轰击了。满腔愤怒的炮兵们等到敌舰一驶进火力圈，就向它们开始猛烈射击。第一颗炮弹落在敌驱逐舰的船艄前面，激起了粗大的水柱。美国海贼受到这突然的打击，便慌张地调转炮口，企图轰击炮兵阵地。朝鲜人民军的炮兵们不顾敌人发射出的炮弹在四周爆炸，牢牢地盯住了敌舰，高喊着“把敌舰打沉到海底去”，更准确地瞄准轰击。他们只发射出九发炮弹就打沉了敌舰。这时候，浮动在驱逐舰周围的那艘扫雷艇连忙转身，加足马力企图逃跑。但在炮手们准确发射的雨点般的炮火中，它只逃出一小段路就被打沉了。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军海军和海岸炮兵们，都决心进一步加强作战，保卫祖国的海洋和海岸，争取更大胜利，粉碎敌人从海上进犯的任何企图。防守某处海岸的人民军海防部队张占山率领的某区分队的海岸炮兵们，曾经在一次对十一艘敌人舰艇的作战中，打沉其中的五艘。这个区分队的英雄的海岸炮手们，在今年新年时表示他们的战斗决心说：不管敌人怎样疯狂地侵犯我们祖国的海岸，我们都一定给它歼灭性的打击！
