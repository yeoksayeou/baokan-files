Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 2nd: This reporter reports: As a result of the heavy casualties inflicted on the Li pseudo-army by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies over the past two years, there are very few veterans left in the units, and new recruits make up a large proportion. According to a prisoner from the 9th Division of the Li pseudo-army, in the first squad (platoon) of the first section (squad) of the sixth company (company) of the second battalion (battalion) of the 29th Regiment (regiment) of the division, only the squad leader and the deputy squad leader joined the army in 1951, and the rest were new recruits captured after August 1952. These people were unwilling to slaughter their compatriots on Korean soil for the American invaders and had resisted military training in the recruit training camp.

The loyal running dog of the American invaders, the Li Seung-man gang, carried out brutal suppression of the new recruits, and more than twenty new recruits were shot dead in the Nonsan recruit training camp in Chungcheongnam-do. Although the new recruits were driven to the front lines with clubs and whips, they secretly said, "You can drive me to the front lines, but you can't drive away my unwillingness to die."

In the American war of aggression against Korea, the soldiers of the Li pseudo-army lived an increasingly miserable life. Because they were not getting enough to eat, they often rushed into the kitchen to grab food and vegetables. Some soldiers said bitterly, "It's better to die after a full meal than to starve every day." In the harsh winter, the soldiers of the Li pseudo-army did not have enough winter clothes and quilts. In the 9th Division of the Li pseudo-army on the central front, many people are still wearing torn single military uniforms and single shoes worn by American soldiers. A corporal in the Li pseudo-army only receives 4,600 won in counterfeit currency per month, but only 3,000 won actually reaches his hands, because 1,600 won is deducted by the officers.

The soldiers of the Li pseudo-army are also subjected to the brutal oppression and exploitation of their officers. They are often beaten and forced to do hard labor by the officers, and many people dare not even speak when they are sick, fearing that they will be considered to be feigning illness by the officers and subjected to heavier punishment. The officers of the Li pseudo-army even take away the watches of the wounded soldiers and the clothes of the new recruits, and force the soldiers to give them gifts. When a communications soldier from the 9th Company of the 27th Regiment of the 5th Division of the Li pseudo-army asked for leave to return home, he starved for two meals and used his food expenses to buy a bottle of brandy in order to give a gift to the company commander. After he gave the wine to the company commander, he hid and cried bitterly.

Those Li pseudo-army officers who were taught by American advisors drank and enjoyed themselves in the bunkers every day. Kim Chun-seop, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 27th Regiment of the Pseudo 5th Division, once brought a woman to live in his shelter for two months, which made the soldiers scold behind his back: "This army is simply a pack of dogs!" The pseudo-army officers looked forward to rotation every day at the front, and officers above the regimental commander engaged in speculative business, with quotation boards for Incheon, Seoul, and Busan always hanging in their rooms.

The phenomena of desertion, self-injury, and surrender are gradually increasing in the Li pseudo-army. According to a prisoner from the 2nd Battalion of the 29th Regiment of the Pseudo 9th Division, "In our company, more than twenty people have deserted in the two months or so from last November to the present." In the past, self-injury mostly occurred in combat, but now it is also common in peacetime. Two sentries from the 29th Regiment of the Pseudo 9th Division injured their feet by hitting each other while on sentry duty. A private first class from the 9th Company of the 27th Regiment of the Pseudo 5th Division shot through his own thigh with a carbine. Some soldiers heard the broadcasts of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies at the front about the tragic life of the South Korean people, the realities of life inside the pseudo-army, and the correct policy of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies of treating insurgents leniently, and wrapped a white towel around their arms and ran to our army's positions to surrender. This is the only correct path for them to escape death and move towards a new life.

### 李伪军内部腐败士气低沉

    李伪军内部腐败士气低沉
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】本社记者报道：李伪军二年多来不断遭到朝中人民军队大量杀伤的结果，部队中的老兵已经很少了，新兵占了很大的比例数。据一个李伪军第九师的俘虏说，在该师二十九联队（团）二大队（营）六中队（连）一小队
    （排）一分队（班）里，只有分队长和分队副两个人是一九五一年入伍的，其他都是一九五二年八月以后被抓来的新兵。这些人都不愿意为美国侵略者在朝鲜的国土上屠杀自己的同胞，曾经在新兵训练所里抗拒军事训练。
    美国侵略者的忠实走狗李承晚匪帮对新兵施行了残酷的镇压，忠清南道的论山新兵训练所里就枪杀了二十多个新兵。新兵们虽然被木棍、皮鞭赶上了前线，但他们都暗暗地说：“你能把我赶上前线，可是却不能赶掉我不愿送死的心。”
    在美国侵略朝鲜的战争中，李伪军士兵们过着愈来愈恶劣的生活。他们因为吃不饱，常常到厨房里抢饭抢菜。有的士兵愤懑地说：“只要吃上一顿饱饭，死了也比每天挨饿强。”在严寒的冬天，李伪军士兵没有足够的冬衣和棉被。在中部战线的李伪军第九师里，很多人到现在还穿着美国兵穿破的单军衣和单鞋子。李伪军一个下士每月薪饷只有四千六百元伪币，但实际到手的只有三千元，因为一千六百元被军官克扣去了。
    李伪军士兵们还受到他们军官们残暴的压迫和榨取。他们常常遭到军官的毒打和罚苦役，有许多人甚至有病也不敢说，害怕被军官认为是装病而受到更重的处罚。李伪军军官甚至把伤兵的手表、新兵的衣服都拿去，并强迫士兵给他们送礼。李伪军第五师二十七联队九中队的一个通讯兵请假回家归队时，为要给中队长送礼，竟饿了两顿饭，把伙食费贴上，买了一瓶白兰地酒。他把酒送给中队长以后躲着痛哭了一场。
    那些被美国顾问教养出来的李伪军军官们每天在地堡里喝酒享乐。伪五师二十七联队三大队大队长金春楫曾把一个女人弄到他的掩蔽部里住了两个月，气得士兵们都在背后骂：“这个军队简直是狗群！”伪军军官们在前线时天天盼换防，联队长以上的军官都做投机生意，屋子里一直挂着仁川、汉城和釜山的行情表。
    李伪军中逃亡、自伤、投降的现象在逐渐增多。据伪九师二十九联队二大队的一个俘虏说：“我们一个中队里，从去年十一月到现在的两个多月中，就逃跑了二十多个人。”自伤的事情过去多发生在战斗中，现在平时也很多。伪九师二十九联队有两个哨兵在放哨时互相打伤了脚。伪五师二十七联队九中队有一个一等兵用卡宾枪打穿了自己的大腿。有的士兵听到朝中人民军队在前线广播的南朝鲜人民的悲惨生活、伪军内部生活实况和朝中人民军队宽待起义敌军的正确政策，便在手臂上缠了一块白毛巾，跑到我军阵地上来投诚了。这是他们逃避死亡走向新生活的唯一正确的道路。
