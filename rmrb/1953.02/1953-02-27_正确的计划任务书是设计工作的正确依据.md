A correct project task book is the correct basis for design work.

Liu Shizan, Director of the Design Department of the Northeast Machinery Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building

The state's basic construction plan is specifically reflected in each design project task book. Basic construction projects begin with the design project task book. If the correctness of the design project task book is problematic, the preliminary design and technical design generated around it will also be useless. If the project is built in this way, it is very likely to cause fundamental and historical errors.

The design project task book for a factory is mainly proposed by the planning department based on the needs of the national economy, the division of labor among factories nationwide, the sequence of construction time, and coordination with relevant industries. However, when accepting a design task, the design department must carefully consider all aspects related to factory design, provide opinions for the planning department's reference, further improve the correctness of the most important part of the design project task book—the product plan—and make it meet the general requirements of combining politics, economics, and technology.

Based on our experience, the design department can analyze the product plan from the following aspects:

(1) Sales and Raw Material Supply: When determining the factory site for a new factory or the product plan for an old factory, it is necessary to consider whether the sum of raw material transportation costs and product transportation costs to the place of use is the lowest (under the principle of meeting national defense and other conditions). This is especially important for products with large volume and heavy tonnage. For example, the cost of transporting boilers from a boiler factory is twice as expensive as transporting steel, and the transportation cost of finished agricultural machinery is also relatively high. The factory site should be located as close as possible to the transportation center.

(2) Spare Parts Quantity: The types and quantities of spare parts that need to be produced simultaneously with the product should be considered, as this is greatly related to determining the production scale. For example, whether rock drills should be equipped with spare pistons, what special accessories lathes should be equipped with, whether boilers should be equipped with steam pipes and valves, whether ball mills should be equipped with steel balls, etc., should be studied carefully.

(3) Product Accuracy Grade: In order to easily allocate equipment and manage production, the products of a factory should preferably have the same level of accuracy. For example, the products of a factory should preferably have the same level of accuracy. For example, metallurgical machinery and heavy-duty machine tools are two products with different accuracy requirements, and it is not appropriate to produce them in the same factory.

(4) Production Scale: After the product variety is determined, it is necessary to determine the output and the size of the production scale. The main factors determining the production scale are: 1. The needs of the national economy; 2. Rational use and conservation of funds. That is to say, a reasonable production scale should be one where the product cost is the lowest. At the same time, the proportion between various products should also be considered reasonable.

(5) Production Nature, Production Method, and Technical Operation: According to different outputs, it can be divided into mass production, batch production, and single production; according to different production natures, production lines with production methods such as assembly line operation, semi-assembly line operation, and universal operation can be adopted; the economically rational technical operation method is determined according to the output and production method.

(6) Maximum Part Size and Weight: The maximum part size and weight of a product are often the factors that determine the maximum production equipment and overweight transportation equipment in each workshop. If the number of large parts is small and the equipment load rate is too low, cooperation with other factories should be considered. For example, large castings and forgings, which are generally needed in small quantities, should be considered to be supplied by other factories for greater economy. If necessary, consider changing the production method or product design.

(7) Product Structure and Materials Used: For example, whether nodular cast iron or forged cast iron is used for agricultural machinery parts, and whether cast iron wheels or cast steel wheels are used for mine cars, should be clearly specified. Different workshops are needed to supply blanks due to different structures and materials used.

Today, large-scale economic construction has begun, and the task is very heavy and intense. If the plan changes frequently, the design will inevitably have to be reworked, and the construction will also be delayed. Therefore, the planning department must carefully check the quality of the basic construction plan, and the design department must carefully study the project task book, and strive to overcome the blind actions and waste of the past!

### 正确的计划任务书是设计工作的正确依据

    正确的计划任务书是设计工作的正确依据
    第一机械工业部东北机械局设计处处长　刘史瓒
    国家基本建设计划具体地表现在每一个设计计划任务书中。基本建设工程是从设计计划任务书开始。如果设计计划任务书的正确性发生问题，围绕设计计划任务书而产生的初步设计和技术设计也就要归于无用。如果这个工程就这样建设起来，那就极可能造成原则性、历史性的错误。
    一个厂的设计计划任务书主要是由计划部门根据国民经济的需要、全国各厂的分工、建设时间的先后及与有关工业的配合等情况提出来的。但设计部门在接受设计任务时，必须详密考虑和工厂设计有关的各方面，提出意见，供计划部门参考，使设计计划任务书中最重要的关节——产品方案的正确性更加提高，并使其合乎政治、经济及技术相结合的总要求。
    根据我们的经验，设计部门可从下列几方面来分析产品方案：
    （一）产品销路和原材料的供应：在新厂确定厂址或旧厂确定产品方案时，必须考虑原材料的运费及产品运往使用地点的运费的总和是否最低（在符合国防及其他条件的原则下）。这对于容积大、吨位重的产品特别重要。例如锅炉厂运锅炉的运费要比运钢材贵二倍，农具机厂成品运输费也较高，应当尽可能使厂地靠近运输中心点。
    （二）备品数量：和产品同时需要生产的备品种类与数量应加考虑，因为这对确定生产规模是有很大关系的。例如凿岩机应不应该附带预备活塞，车床要附带什么特种附件，锅炉要不要附带蒸汽管及汽门，球磨机是否附带钢球等等，应该研究清楚。
    （三）产品精度等级：为了易于配置设备和管理生产，一个工厂的产品最好要有相同的精度，例如一个工厂的产品最好要有相同级的精度。例如冶金机械和重型工作母机是两种不同精度的产品，如放在一个工厂生产就不合适。
    （四）生产规模：当生产品种确定以后，就要确定产量多少，生产规模的大小。确定生产规模的主要因素是：一、国民经济的需要量；二、资金的合理运用和节约。这就是说，合理的生产规模应当是产品成本最低的。同时各种产品相互间的比例，也应考虑是否合理。
    （五）生产性质、生产方法及技术操作：按照不同的产量可分为大批生产、成批生产及单个生产；根据不同的生产性质可采用流水作业、半流水作业及万能性作业等生产方式的生产线；根据产量及生产方式决定经济合理的技术操作方法。
    （六）最大件尺寸及重量：产品最大件尺寸及重量常常是决定各车间最大生产设备和超重运输设备的因素。如果大件数量少，而设备负荷率过低，就应该考虑和其他厂合作。例如一般需要少量的大型铸件和锻件，应考虑由别厂供给较为经济。必要时可考虑改变生产方法或产品设计。
    （七）产品结构及所用材料：例如农具机零件用球墨铸铁或是用锻铸铁，矿车用铸铁车轮还是铸钢车轮等，都应该明确规定。由于结构及采用材料的不同，要有不同的车间来供给毛胚。
    今天大规模经济建设开始了，任务是非常繁重而紧张的。如果计划多变，设计必然要返工，施工也要拖迟。因此，计划部门必须慎重地检查基本建设计划的质量，设计部门也必须周密地研究计划任务书，为克服过去的盲目行动和浪费现象而努力！
