Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 5th: The people in the front and rear areas of Korea are launching movements to comfort and support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in order to greet the "February 8th" fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

Six sub-groups of the Central People's Representative Delegation, composed of representatives from all walks of life and led by the Minister of Public Health of the Cabinet, the Minister of Light Industry, the Minister of Education, and the Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, departed from Pyongyang on January 27 to visit various front-line units for comfort. The Korean National Art Theater, the Classical Art Theater, the Youth Art Troupe, and the Farmer Art Troupe have all sent art troupes to the front lines to perform comfort performances along with the delegations. People's representative delegations and art troupes from North Pyongan Province, Jagang Province, and Hwanghae Province have also set off to the front lines for comfort.

All People's Representative Delegations carried with them a large number of brocade flags, gifts, and enthusiastic letters of comfort presented by the people of various regions to the front-line Korean and Chinese People's Armies. By the end of January, the people of Hwanghae Province had donated more than 200,000 gifts and written 250,000 letters of comfort. In addition to donating a large number of gifts, the people of Pyongyang had already written more than 186,000 letters of comfort by mid-January.

In many areas close to the front lines, working people organized front-line support teams on the eve of the "February 8th" Army Day. Members of the Democratic Youth League in a village in Kimhwa County, Gangwon Province, formed a "Democratic Youth League Frontline Support Team" and went in and out of the fiery front-line area of Kimhwa, assisting the army in transporting ammunition and grain, ensuring the victory of the battle. Women in a village in Goseong County not only actively assisted in escorting the wounded, but also enthusiastically gave blood transfusions to the seriously wounded. Farmers, both men and women, from a certain village braved the artillery fire to personally send more than 20 tons of fodder for horses to a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When they returned to the village, they brought back a batch of clothes taken off by the volunteer soldiers and washed them for them. A few days later, the Young Pioneer members of this village sent the clean clothes to the Volunteer Army uncles, and also sent them more than 500 kilograms of vegetables.

The warm comfort and support of the Korean people has greatly inspired the fighting will of the Korean and Chinese warriors on the front lines, and they are all determined to strive for greater victories before and after the "February 8th" festival to thank the Korean people.

    迎接朝鲜人民军建军五周年
    朝鲜人民热烈慰劳朝中人民部队
    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜前后方各地人民正在展开慰劳和支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的运动，迎接“二·八”朝鲜人民军建军五周年。
    由各界代表组成的中央人民代表团六个分团，在内阁保健相、轻工业相、教育相和职业总同盟委员长的率领下，已在一月二十七日从平壤出发，分赴前线各部队进行慰问。朝鲜国立艺术剧场、古典艺术剧场、青年艺术团和农民艺术团等都派出艺术团随同代表团去前线进行慰问演出。平安北道、慈江道、黄海道等地的人民代表团和艺术团，现在也都已动身去前线进行慰问。
    各人民代表团都携带了各地人民献赠给前线朝中人民军队的大批锦旗、礼物和热情的慰问信。到一月下旬，黄海道人民已捐献礼物二十多万件，写慰问信二十五万封。平壤市人民除去捐献了大批礼物之外，到一月中旬就已经写了慰问信十八万六千多封。
    在许多临近火线的地区，劳动人民们在“二·八”建军节前夕都组织了火线援助队。江原道金化郡某里的民主青年同盟盟员组成“民青火线援助队”，出入金化前线炮火纷飞的火线地带，协助军队搬运弹药、粮食，保障了战斗的胜利。高城郡某里的妇女们不但积极协助护送伤员，而且踊跃地给重伤员输血。某村庄的男女农民冒着炮火给中国人民志愿军某部亲自送去二十多吨喂马的草料。回村时，他们带回了志愿军勇士们换下来的一批衣服，代他们煮洗。几天以后，这个村庄的儿童团团员们把洗干净的衣服送给志愿军叔叔，还顺便给他们送去了五百多斤蔬菜。
    朝鲜人民的热情慰劳和支援，大大鼓舞了前线朝中勇士们的战斗意志，他们都决心在“二·八”节前后争取更大的胜利来答谢朝鲜人民。
