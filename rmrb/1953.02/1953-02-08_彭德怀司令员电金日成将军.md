Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 7th: Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers sent a telegram to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, congratulating the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The telegram reads as follows:

To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, I, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, extend to you and all comrades of the heroic Korean People's Army our warmest congratulations.

For more than two years, the Korean People's Army has created great achievements in the just struggle against the American aggressors and their puppet Syngman Rhee clique. Together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, it drove American imperialism back to its starting point for launching the war of aggression—the "38th parallel"—and established a solid defense line, preventing the enemy from advancing an inch.

Under your leadership, the Korean People's Army has undergone severe and glorious tests. It has proven itself not only as a loyal and heroic defender of the independence and freedom of the Korean nation, but also as an important force for defending peace in the East and the world. The glorious historical path of the Korean People's Army proves that the people's army is invincible.

The close unity between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army has dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors. I firmly believe that in the struggle against our common enemy, continuously strengthening internationalist unity and mutual assistance, we will ultimately defeat the American aggressor troops and their vassal armies.

At present, the American imperialists, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, are frantically preparing to launch new large-scale military adventures. We can fully believe that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, having undergone severe tests, will surely unite and give any adventurer a fatal blow.

Victory will surely belong to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    彭德怀司令员电金日成将军
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军致电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军，祝贺朝鲜人民军建军节。电文如下：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军：
    值兹朝鲜人民军建军五周年纪念的时候，我谨代表中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员向您和英雄的朝鲜人民军全体同志致以最热烈的祝贺。
    两年多来朝鲜人民军在反对美国侵略者及其傀儡李承晚集团的正义战斗中，创建了伟大的功绩。它与兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一起，把美帝国主义打回到它发动侵略战争的出发地——“三八”线，并建立了一道巩固的防线，使敌军寸步不能前进。
    朝鲜人民军在您的领导下，已经历了严重而光荣的考验。它证明了自己不仅是朝鲜民族独立和自由的忠诚不渝的英勇保卫者，而且是保卫东方和世界和平的重要力量。朝鲜人民军光辉的历史道路证明了人民的军队是不可战胜的。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的亲密团结，已经沉重地打击了侵略者。我坚信：我们在反对共同敌人的战斗中，不断地加强国际主义的团结互助，必能最后战胜美国侵略军及其附庸军队。
    目前，美帝国主义者不顾全世界人民的和平愿望，正在疯狂地准备发动新的大规模的军事冒险。我们可以充分相信：经过严重考验的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，必能团结一致给予任何冒险者以致命的打击。
    胜利一定属于英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军！
            中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
                    一九五三年二月五日
