Xinhua News Agency Report: In order to create experience for comprehensively carrying out the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law, provinces (cities), special districts, and counties throughout the country have universally conducted key pilot work for the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law. Now, the key pilot work in most provinces (cities) and special districts has been completed. In areas where the work has been done well, a new atmosphere has emerged, and the masses warmly support the Marriage Law.

The key pilot work in various regions is roughly divided into four steps: First, a group of cadres is drawn from relevant agencies and organizations for training to form a working team, with each team responsible for the pilot work at a designated "point." After the working team arrives at the "point," they study the Marriage Law together with the responsible cadres of the local organizations, and train other grassroots cadres and activists. After the grassroots cadres have a clear understanding, they examine whether there are any erroneous thoughts or behaviors that violate the Marriage Law among these grassroots cadres. At the same time, they help the grassroots cadres arrange various tasks and teach them how to combine various tasks. Second, the working team, together with local grassroots cadres and activists, conducts in-depth publicity and education among the masses, explains the basic content of the Marriage Law, criticizes the disadvantages of the feudal marriage system, patiently answers the masses' questions, and strives to make the Marriage Law known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Third, for some marriage and family problems that the masses themselves have raised and requested to be resolved, help them hold family meetings, mediate some marriage disputes, and help them establish family democratic and harmonious unity production conventions. Fourth, select model couples, model mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and model cadres who adhere to the implementation of the Marriage Law, and commend them among the masses.

The pilot experience in various regions proves that some regions, understanding the spirit of the central government's instructions and adhering to the education policy, have achieved good results. After the broad masses of people thoroughly understand the benefits of the Marriage Law, they all expressed their warm support for the Marriage Law. Some people who previously regarded the Marriage Law as a "women's law" or a "divorce law" now say that the Marriage Law has five advantages: it is good for men, women, old, young, and production. According to investigations, in Fancun and Gangqiao townships in Kaifeng County, Henan Province, before the key experiment was carried out, because the Marriage Law was not well publicized, about 80 percent of the masses and cadres had unclear understandings and many concerns about the Marriage Law. After in-depth publicity and education during the key experiment, more than 90 percent actively supported the Marriage Law. After the masses' thinking was improved, the trend of free love gradually formed. The masses in the pilot townships of Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province, spontaneously put forward the slogan "Dig out the feudal roots and plant happy seedlings," and many parents abandoned their attempts to interfere with and arrange their children's marriages. In areas that have undergone key trials, with the help of working groups and cadres, on the basis of the masses' improved ideological awareness and voluntary participation, many marriage and family disputes that could not be resolved for a long time have been resolved. Many people, especially young women, have greatly improved their production enthusiasm and actively participated in various social activities because their marriage problems have been satisfactorily resolved.

However, contrary to the above situation, the key pilot work for publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law in many regions has not fully conformed to the spirit of the central government's instructions. Some only generally talked about the provisions of the Marriage Law, failing to solve the ideological problems of grassroots cadres and the masses; some adopted the method of door-to-door evaluation to check the implementation of the Marriage Law; and some even adopted inappropriate methods such as mobilizing women to accuse their husbands and parents-in-law. Therefore, in these areas, the effect of publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law was very poor. Now, various regions are seriously summing up the experiences and lessons of the key pilot work, promoting correct practices, and correcting deviations, so that the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law can be carried out in a healthy manner and achieve the expected results. The Northeast Region's Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee recently convened a pilot work meeting, once again emphasizing the adherence to the education policy, pointing out that this is the key to doing a good job in publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law.

According to the inspection of the Southwest Region Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, many regions still have the phenomenon of neglecting preparatory work. Many of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees at the special district level have only two or three cadres. The Zigong City Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee in Sichuan Province did not even have a single cadre. The Southwest Region Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee recently held a meeting to conduct detailed research and discussion on the nature, principles, and requirements of the movement. The meeting held that the key to doing a good job in preparing for the Marriage Law Implementation Movement lies in the attention of the party and government leaders of each province and city. In addition to general arrangements, local leaders should also personally grasp, specifically inspect, and strictly supervise.

    全国各地为开展贯彻婚姻法运动创造经验
    进行贯彻婚姻法试点工作
    据新华社讯：为了给全面开展宣传贯彻婚姻法运动创造经验，全国各省（市）、专区、县普遍进行了宣传和贯彻婚姻法的重点试验工作。现在各省
    （市）及专区的重点试验工作大部分已经结束。做得好的地区，都出现了新气象，群众都热烈拥护婚姻法。
    各地重点试验工作大致分为四个步骤：第一、从各有关机关和团体抽调一批干部加以训练，组成一批工作队，每个工作队担任一个“点”的试验工作。工作队到“点”里后，再和“点”里的各个组织的负责干部共同学习婚姻法，同时训练其他基层干部和积极分子。在基层干部有了明确的认识之后，就在这些基层干部中检查有无违反婚姻法的错误思想和行为。同时，帮助基层干部把各种工作安排好，教给他们如何把各种工作结合起来的方法。第二、工作队联合当地基层干部和积极分子，向群众进行深入的宣传教育，讲解婚姻法的基本内容，并批判封建婚姻制度的坏处，耐心地解答群众的疑难问题，力求家喻户晓，深入人心。第三、对于群众自己所提出来要求解决的一些婚姻与家庭问题，帮助他们召开家庭会议，调解一些婚姻纠纷，并帮助订立家庭民主和睦团结生产的公约。第四、评选模范夫妇、模范婆媳和坚持执行婚姻法的模范干部，在群众中进行表扬。
    各地试点经验证明：有些地区领会中央指示的精神，坚持教育的方针，做得好的，就得到很好的效果。广大群众彻底了解婚姻法的好处后，都表示热烈拥护婚姻法，有些过去把婚姻法看成是“妇女法”、“离婚法”的人，现在都说婚姻法有五好：对男、女、老、小、生产都好。据调查，河南开封县范村、岗桥两个乡在未进行重点试验前，由于没有很好地宣传婚姻法，群众和干部对婚姻法认识不清、顾虑很多的人几占百分之八十，重点试验中经过深入的宣传教育，百分之九十以上都积极拥护婚姻法了。群众思想有了提高后，自由恋爱的风气也逐渐形成了。河南商邱专区试点乡的群众自动提出“挖掉封建根，栽上幸福苗”的口号，很多父母都放弃了干涉和包办子女婚姻的企图。经过重点试验的地区，在群众思想觉悟提高和自觉自愿的基础上，由于工作组和干部的帮助，许多长久不能解决的婚姻和家庭纠纷问题都得到解决。许多群众，特别是青年妇女，由于婚姻问题得到满意的解决，生产情绪大为提高，并且积极参加了各种社会活动。
    但是，和上述情况相反，许多地区宣传贯彻婚姻法的重点试验工作没有完全符合中央指示的精神，有的只是一般地讲讲婚姻法的条文，未能解决基层干部和群众的思想问题；有的采用了挨户排队评比的方法来检查婚姻法贯彻情形；有的甚至采用发动妇女控诉丈夫和公婆等不适当的方法。因此在这些地区，宣传贯彻婚姻法的效果就很不好。现在各地都在认真总结重点试验工作的经验教训，推广正确作法，纠正偏差，以便使宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动能够健康地开展，获得预期的效果。东北区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在最近召开的试点工作会议上，再度强调了坚持教育的方针，指出这是作好宣传贯彻婚姻法工作的关键。
    根据西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会检查，不少地区还有忽视准备工作的现象。不少的专区一级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会，只有二、三个干部。四川省自贡市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会竟连一个干部也没有。西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会最近召开会议，对运动的性质、方针和要求作了详尽的研究和讨论。会议认为做好贯彻婚姻法运动的准备工作的关键，在于各省、市的党、政领导的重视。各地领导同志除一般布置外，还应亲自掌握，具体检查，严格监督。
