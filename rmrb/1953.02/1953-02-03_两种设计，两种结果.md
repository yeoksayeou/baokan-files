Two Designs, Two Results
Zhang Daqi

In the past two years, the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building has taken many detours in some factory designs. Although Soviet experts have repeatedly helped and instructed us later, some errors have already become facts, causing unnecessary losses to state property. Now, I will compare the shortcomings of a factory designed by ourselves with the advantages of a factory designed for us by Soviet experts for the reference of comrades working in design departments.

A Factory Designed by Our Technical Personnel

The process of designing the No. 4 Electrical Engineering Factory by ourselves was very complicated. The factory construction policy was not determined, and no data was investigated before starting the design. During the design process, we were building while designing and modifying while building. After two years, the design work has not been completed. The main shortcomings in the design are as follows:

First, we did not pay attention to collecting data. For example, when selecting a site in Suihua, three people inspected it for less than a day and decided on the address because there was water and electricity available and convenient railway transportation. Subsequently, we started the design without surveying. After the factory's dedicated railway was built, two warehouses were built, and the materials and some equipment used for the factory construction were transported in, we discovered that Suihua had experienced earthquakes, and this type of area was not suitable for building a factory. We were forced to stop midway and choose another site elsewhere. This caused a great waste. However, when selecting a new site for design, we still did not pay good attention to surveying and research. For example, the elevation of the railway and the garage were inconsistent (differing by 0.6 meters), causing difficulties in transportation. Placing the boiler on the upwind side of the insulation material workshop, which is the most dust-sensitive in the entire factory, has a great impact on product quality.

Second, we blindly believed in the information from the American "Westinghouse" company, causing serious waste. We once formulated a product plan for a comprehensive factory by referring to the factory design draft made by the American "Westinghouse" company for the pseudo-Resources Committee. The products listed in this plan were complex, which would inevitably cause difficulties in management and make it difficult to improve business and technical levels. This also violated the country's policy of planned and prioritized construction. Later, it was corrected after repeated instructions from the leadership. The product drawings we used in the design were all from "Westinghouse." "Westinghouse's" product design was extremely chaotic, non-standardized, and there were very few common parts between different products. Therefore, the man-hours and equipment required for manufacturing were inevitably wasteful. We also took some products that were not commonly used as typical products. For example, the double-rotor DC motor is a special product, with a shaft of 6.5 meters long. It is still questionable whether it will be produced in the future, but a particularly long large lathe was selected for it. The selection of equipment was also based on "Westinghouse's" model. For example, for the motor outlet box, we should have used cast iron (saving), but because "Westinghouse" used sheet metal to punch it out, we followed suit. In the design of the substation, we once adopted a higher power utilization rate (0.7) according to British and American standards. Later, after listening to the report of Soviet experts, we reduced the power utilization rate to an appropriate value (0.25), greatly reducing transformer equipment and saving investment. Regarding the equipment utilization rate, we initially followed the "Westinghouse" quota and stipulated many unscientific factors. For example, the equipment maintenance time was 15%, the worker attendance rate was 84%, and the night shift efficiency was 90%. After many deductions, the original equipment could be used for 4,600 hours a year, but it was only calculated as 2,500 hours. When calculating product man-hours, we used a 15,000 kW motor to replace an 8,000 kW motor, which increased the safety factor and caused great waste to the country. Technically, due to the influence of "Westinghouse," we did not actively adopt advanced technologies. For example, high-speed cutting was not adopted until after the "Three-Anti" campaign last year. Other things such as waste steam utilization, wastewater recovery, and mechanization of heavy work were only started after ideological criticism.

Third, divorced from reality. There was a saying popular among construction workers: the designers think very well in the house, calculate very well, and draw very beautifully, but it doesn't work on the construction site. This means that the phenomenon of being divorced from reality is very serious in the entire factory design. For example, the chief engineer only went to the construction site once after the first factory building was built and found that the elevation of the railway and the warehouse were inconsistent. A swing arm crane in the medium-sized workshop was not as high as the machine and could not be used. Arranging machines according to photos looked good on the drawing, but after the machines were installed, it was found that the distance between the machines was either too tight or too loose. Using materials and equipment for heating and ventilation without a good understanding of their specifications and performance also caused many problems. In addition, many errors divorced from reality were caused by carelessness in work. For example, there was a shower head only 1.8 meters above the ground, and people who were a little taller could not raise their heads when showering. A toilet was designed very narrowly, and people with a fat body could not use it. The designers originally had very little practical experience, and coupled with the style of being divorced from reality and carelessness, the shortcomings became even more serious.

Fourth, there was no working-class standpoint and viewpoint. In the early stage of design, this error was quite serious. No living rooms were set up in the workshops in the design; there were no plans to build a canteen in the entire factory; the toilets were built in the middle of a row of dormitories; some dormitories were arranged so that they could not see the sun all year round. The design did not pay attention to the safety of workers. There was no fire prevention and ventilation equipment in the paint dipping equipment in the medium-sized workshop, and there was no explosion-proof equipment in the insulation workshop. The roofs of the medium-sized and insulation workshops should have been fireproof according to the nature of the production, but no necessary measures were taken. The crane slip line was exposed, which was prone to work-related injuries. All machines were not grounded, which was prone to electric shock accidents. All of this showed that the designers did not have the concept of safe production. It was only after study and the guidance of Soviet experts that it was corrected.

Fifth, there was no correct overall design, resulting in rework and waste. The entire design work was carried out in a rush for quick results and without paying attention to the design process. We started designing without surveying and collecting data; we started technical design before the preliminary design was completed, and it was carried out very quickly and hastily; we started building the factory building before the technical design was completed. As a result, the design was to piece together houses and equipment, and if it didn't fit well, the houses had to be demolished or the equipment wasted. For example, two warehouses were built next to the medium-sized workshop according to the first arrangement, but later the layout diagram was changed, and according to the new layout, the warehouses had to be demolished. The first overall layout of the entire factory had the front area in the northwest end, but the new layout moved the front area to the southwest end, so the research room built in the northwest end according to the first layout was left there all alone. Due to the frequent changes in the overall layout, there were many cases of "pipeline conflicts" underground and building and demolition.

A Factory Designed by Soviet Experts

This factory originally produced electric wires. In 1950, we asked Soviet experts to transform it into a cable factory. The design of this factory went through two collections of data, preliminary design, and technical design, all in accordance with the procedures. The design book made was very complete and correct. The main advantages of this design are as follows:

First, the data was collected completely and accurately. For example, for geological data, soil and water samples were taken through drilling, and chemical and physical analyses were performed, as well as soil bearing capacity tests. A report was written based on the results of the investigation, and conclusions were drawn based on the report. In addition, geological data and drawings of the city where the factory was located were also collected as supplements. In terms of surveying, the general layout of the factory was accurately surveyed and mapped. Other aspects such as power supply system, water supply system, drainage, heating, heating and ventilation, civil engineering, transportation, and production were all investigated in great detail. During the investigation, not only important information was understood, but even very small details such as the location of a light bulb were recorded. After the investigation, conclusions were drawn on all the investigation results. For example, the degree of oldness of the factory buildings (how long is the original lifespan, how many years have been used) and the degree of obsolescence (the degree of irrationality, such as the windows are not large enough, the houses are not high enough) were scientifically analyzed according to the results of the investigation and identified. These tasks were carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, laying the foundation for correct design.

Second, the idea of economic accounting was fully implemented, the original factory buildings and equipment were fully utilized, and the most advanced technology was adopted. All the buildings in the entire factory were preserved and utilized except for a small boiler room and a gatehouse. The old factory buildings that had been destroyed by the enemy and puppets were originally planned to be demolished during the preliminary design, but after repeated research during the technical design, it was finally decided to repair and utilize them. For the original equipment, everything that could be used was used as much as possible. For example, there was a crane in a factory building that was waiting to be repaired, and the Chinese technicians working with the experts planned to scrap it, but the experts insisted on repairing it and using it. However, some things that should be replaced, such as the original roof of the factory building was not well insulated, which was harmful to the health of the workers and also affected the lifespan of the roof truss, were decided to be replaced completely from a long-term perspective. Another example is the substation problem. The city's power bureau believed that the factory must build its own substation. In fact, there was a substation 100 meters away from the factory, so the experts insisted that the factory did not need to build another substation and only needed to lay a cable. After repeated negotiations, the power bureau agreed, saving our country about 3.5 billion yuan. In order to fully utilize waste materials, a waste material workshop was added to the factory to use waste materials to make useful products.

This factory is very advanced in technology. The layout principle of the entire factory is full-flow operation, and the machines used are the latest and tend to be mechanized and automated. After the renovation, the rubber wire will increase by twelve times compared to the original, the calendering and wire drawing will increase by five times, and telecommunications cables can also be produced. The design feature of this factory is to use the latest manufacturing technology and occupy the smallest area.

Third, closely integrated with reality. One of the biggest features of the design done by experts is that it is practical. The materials used in the construction were determined after detailed investigation, and so was the equipment. In order to solve some equipment by China itself as much as possible, the experts spent a lot of time collecting information about the equipment, and they found some that we didn't even know about. Finally, according to the conditions of the equipment, it was decided which ones would be made by ourselves and which ones would be made by the Soviet Union, which gave us a good grasp of the guarantee of the equipment. Other examples include the design of the dining hall. The experts did not know how to cook Chinese food, so they left it to us to do it ourselves. Another example is that they found that the Northeast employees were accustomed to squatting when defecating, so they adopted squatting-style toilets when designing the toilets. The experts' practical working style is really worth learning.

Fourth, pay attention to the safety and welfare of workers. The experts considered the safety and welfare of the workers very carefully. Fire prevention, heat preservation, and technical security equipment were all done very well. The building coefficient of this factory building is already very high, but they still tried to squeeze out a green area and build a garden for workers to rest.

Fifth, all design work was carried out in accordance with the procedures. After the plan task book was determined, data collection was carried out. Preliminary design was started after the data was collected. After approval, data for technical design was collected. After the technical design was completed, construction design was carried out. Several schemes were made for comparison during the preliminary design, and the design principles were carefully determined to ensure the quality of the design and avoid rework and waste in the technical design.

From the comparison of the above two examples, the design of Soviet experts achieved "good, economical, and fast"; while our own design was of poor quality, wasteful, and very slow. Why is this? Mainly because our designers had many serious wrong ideas before the "Three-Anti" campaign last year. First, the idea of worshiping the United States, blindly believing that "Westinghouse is the best in the world." Secondly, due to blind faith in "American standards," serious conservative ideas were generated. Thirdly, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, our designers also neglected the safety and welfare of workers. For example, some people saw that workers in the United States ate next to the machines with lunch boxes, so they thought it was not necessary to build a canteen in our factory.

According to our experience, to overcome the above-mentioned wrong ideas of technical personnel, we must strengthen political study and launch criticism and self-criticism to make them consciously awakened ideologically. Secondly, we must resolutely and systematically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Only in this way can we improve our work and live up to the expectations and requirements of the people.

    两种设计，两种结果
    张大奇
    第一机械工业部东北电工局设计处在过去两年所作的一些工厂设计中，走了不少弯路。后来虽然经过苏联专家一再帮助和指教，但因为有些错误已经著成事实，使国家财产仍然遭到不应有的损失。现在把我们自己设计的一个工厂中的缺点，和苏联专家为我们设计的一个工厂的优点对比地写出来，供设计部门的工作同志参考。
    我们技术人员设计的一个工厂
    我们自己设计电工四厂的经过是非常复杂的。建厂的方针没有确定，也不调查资料，就进行设计，在设计过程中边设计边盖，边盖边改。经过两年时间，设计工作还没有完成。设计中主要的缺点如下：
    一、不重视收集资料。如在绥化选择厂址时，三个人在那里察看了不到一天，认为有水有电可以利用，铁路交通方便，就决定了地址。随后，没有勘测就进行设计。等到工厂专用铁路修好了，已经盖了两幢仓库，并把建厂所用的材料和部分设备也运进去了，我们才发现绥化曾发生过地震，这种地区，是不能建厂的，这才被迫中途停止，另在别的地方选择厂址。这就造成很大的浪费。但是，在选定新的厂址进行设计时，我们对勘测工作和资料研究仍没有给予很好的重视。如铁路与车库标高不一
    （相差零点六公尺），给搬运工作造成困难。把锅炉放在全厂最忌灰尘的绝缘材料车间的上风，对产品质量有很大影响。
    二、迷信美国“西屋”公司的资料，造成严重浪费。我们曾比照着美国“西屋”公司给伪资源委员会所作的工厂设计草案，制订了一个综合厂的产品方案。这一方案中所列产品复杂，必然引起管理上的困难，业务和技术水平不易提高。这也违反了国家有计划有重点的建设方针。后来经过领导方面一再指示才改正过来。我们在设计中所用的产品图纸都是“西屋”公司的，“西屋”公司的产品设计极其紊乱，不标准化，不同产品之间的共用零件也很少，因此在制造上所需的工时和设备必然很浪费。有些产品虽然不是常用的，我们也拿来作为典型产品。如双转子直流机，是一种特殊产品，轴有六公尺半长，以后是否需要生产还是问题，但为了它也选用了一部特别长的大车床。设备的选择也都以
    “西屋”公司的为蓝本。如电机出线盒，我们本来应该采用铸铁（节省），但因“西屋”公司是用铁皮在冲上冲出来的，我们也就跟着冲。在变电所的设计上，我们曾依照英美标准采用了较高的电力使用率（零点七），后来听了苏联专家的报告，才把电力使用率降低到恰当数值（零点二五），大大减低了变压设备，节省了投资。又如设备利用率问题，我们最初也是按照“西屋”公司的定额，规定了很多不科学的因数。如设备检修时间为百分之十五，工人出勤率为百分之八十四，夜班效率为百分之九十等等，七折八扣，结果，本来一台设备一年可以使用四千六百小时，结果只算成二千五百小时。在计算产品工时时，采用一万五千瓩电机来代替八千瓩电机，提高了安全系数，给国家造成很大浪费。在技术上因为受了“西屋”公司的影响，也没有积极地采用先进技术。如高速切削法一直到去年“三反”后才被我们采用。其他如废汽利用，废水回收，沉重工作的机械化等，也还是经过思想批判才开始运用的。
    三、脱离实际。在施工工人当中曾流行过一种说法：设计人员坐在房子里想得很好，计算得也很好，图画得很漂亮，就是在工地里行不通。这就是说，整个工厂设计中脱离实际的现象是十分严重的。如主任工程师，一直到第一座厂房盖好以后才下工地看了一次，发现铁路与仓库的标高不一致。中型车间有一台摇臂吊车还没有机器高，不能使用。照样片排列机器，在图上看着很好，等到把机器安装好了以后，才发现机器间的距离不是太紧就是太松。对暖气通风所用的材料和设备，没有很好地了解它的规格和效能便采用到设计上去，也出了很多毛病。此外，由于工作中的粗枝大叶也造成很多脱离实际的错误。如有一个淋浴龙头，离地只有一点八公尺高，稍为高一点的人在进行淋浴时就抬不起头来。有一个厕所设计得很窄，身体胖的人就没法用。设计的人本来实际经验就很少，再加上脱离实际和粗枝大叶的作风，缺点就更加严重了。
    四、没有工人阶级的立场和观点。在设计初期，这种错误是相当严重的。设计中的车间里不设生活用室；全厂不打算建食堂；把厕所建立在一排宿舍的中间；有的宿舍摆得长年不见阳光。设计中对于工人的安全也不注意，中型车间浸漆设备中没有防火通风设备，绝缘车间也没有防爆设备，中型和绝缘车间的屋顶按照生产性质应该是防火的，也没有作必要的措施，吊车滑线露在外面容易发生工伤事故，所有的机器全不接地，容易发生触电事故。这一切都表现设计者没有安全生产的观点，后来经过学习和苏联专家的指教，才改正过来。
    五、没有正确的总体设计，造成了返工浪费。整个设计工作是在急于求成、不重视设计程序的情况下进行的。没有勘测和收集资料便开始设计；初步设计没有作完便开始进行技术设计，而且进行得很快很草率；技术设计没有作好就先盖厂房。结果使设计凑房子凑设备，凑不好就得拆房子或者浪费设备。如中型车间旁边按照第一次的布置盖了两所仓库，后来布置图又改了，按照新的布置，仓库就要拆除。第一次全厂的布置，厂前区是在西北端，新布置又把厂前区挪到西南端，因此按照第一次布置在西北端所建的研究室就孤零零地悬在那里。由于总体布置常变，地下“管路打架”和建了又拆的事是很多的。
    苏联专家设计的一个工厂
    这个工厂原来是生产电线的，一九五零年请苏联专家为我们改造为电缆厂。这个厂的设计曾经过两次搜集资料，初步设计和技术设计，都按照程序办事。所作的设计书非常完整和正确。这个设计的主要优点如下：
    一、资料收集得完整而准确。如地质资料，经过钻探采取土样和水样，作了化学和物理全量分析，以及地耐压力试验。根据调查的结果写成报告，根据报告作出结论。此外还收集了有关工厂所在城市的地质资料和图纸作为补充。在测量方面，精确地测绘了工厂总平面图。其他如对供电系统，给水系统，下水方面，供热，取暖通风，土木建筑，运输，生产等方面，都作了极详尽的调查。在调查当中，不但了解重要的情况，连极微小的如一个电灯的位置也记录下来。调查以后，并对所有的调查结果作出结论，如厂房的用旧程度（原有寿命多长，已使用多少年）和陈旧程度（不合理的程度，如窗子不够大，房屋不够高等），都是按照调查的结果加以科学的分析，作出鉴定。这些工作都是有计划有步骤地进行的，给正确的设计打下了基础。
    二、充分贯彻经济核算思想，充分利用原有厂房和设备，采用最先进的技术。全厂的房屋除去一个小锅炉房和一个门房外，全部保存利用。旧有的被敌伪毁坏过的厂房，在初步设计时本来想把它拆除，但在进行技术设计时经再三研究，最后决定修补利用。对原有设备，能用的尽量利用，如某厂房内有一台待修的吊车，和专家共同工作的我国技术人员打算把它作废，专家则坚持把它修复使用。但有些应该换的，如厂房原有的屋顶保暖不好，对工人的健康有害，对屋架的寿命也有影响，从长远利益出发，决定全部更换。又如变电所的问题，该市电业局认为厂内必须自己建立一个变电所；其实离厂一百公尺就有一个变电所，因而专家坚持厂内不必另设变电所，只要放一根电缆就行了。经过再三交涉，得到了电业局的同意，为我们国家节省了约三十五亿元。为了充分利用废料，厂内增设了一个废料车间，利用废料作有用的产品。
    这个厂在技术方面是非常先进的，全厂的布置原则是全部流水作业化，所采用的机器是最新式的，且趋向于机械化，自动化。改建后，橡皮线比原来要增加十二倍，压延及拉线增加五倍，并可生产电讯电缆。这个厂的设计特点就是利用最新的制造技术，占用最小的面积。
    三、与实际密切结合。专家所做的设计，最大的特色之一是切合实际。在建筑上所用的材料是经过详细调查以后才决定的，设备也是如此。为了尽量由中国自行解决一些设备，专家曾化了很多时间收集有关设备的资料，有些连我们还不知道的他都找到了。最后根据设备的条件，决定那些由我们自己作，那些由苏联作，对设备的保证就有了十分把握。其他如饭堂的设计，专家不知道中国饭如何作法，他们就交给我们自己作。又如他们发现东北职工大便习惯喜欢蹲着，在设计厕所时就采用蹲式毛坑。专家切合实际的工作作风，实在值得我们学习。
    四、重视工人的安全和福利。专家对工人的安全和福利考虑得很周到，防火、保暖及技术保安设备都作得很完善，这个厂厂房建筑系数已经很高，但仍设法挤出一块绿化地带，建立一个花园，供工人休息之用。
    五、全部设计工作是按照程序进行的。计划任务书确定后进行资料收集，资料收集好才开始作初步设计，经批准后再收集作技术设计的资料，技术设计作好以后，再进行施工设计。在初步设计时曾作出几个方案作比较，慎重地确定设计原则，保证了设计质量，避免了技术设计上的返工浪费。
    从以上两个例子对比来看，苏联专家的设计做到了“又好、又省、又快”；而我们自己的设计质量低劣，浪费很大，并且很慢。这是为什么呢？主要是因为我们设计人员在去年“三反”以前有许多严重的错误思想。第一，崇美思想，盲目地相信“西屋公司天下第一”。其次，由于迷信“美国标准”，产生了严重的保守思想。再次，由于资产阶级思想的影响，我们的设计人员也忽视工人的安全和福利。如有的人在美国看见工人都是在机器旁边提着饭盒子吃饭，因此也就以为没有必要在我们工厂中盖食堂。
    根据我们的经验，要克服技术人员以上几种错误思想，必须加强政治学习，展开批评与自我批评，使他们从思想上自觉起来。其次，必须坚决地有计划地学习苏联先进经验。只有这样才能把我们的工作提高一步，才不辜负人民对我们的期望和要求。
