    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Intensifies Preparations for Engineering Equipment
    As the commencement of large-scale capital construction projects this year draws nearer, the preparation of a large quantity of engineering equipment at the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) is being accelerated. Now, day and night, trains fully loaded with engineering equipment ordered from domestic and foreign sources as early as last year are rumbling into Ansteel's huge equipment storage warehouses. Judging from the current state of Ansteel's equipment preparation, the phenomenon of delayed equipment supply affecting project progress in the past will be significantly improved this year. Last year, 107 machine factories and 79 other relevant enterprises in 24 cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changsha, Taiyuan, Jinan, Shenyang, Dalian, and Qiqihar overcame all difficulties to manufacture and supply Ansteel with a large amount of equipment on schedule or ahead of schedule. This year, in Ansteel's equipment orders, all those that can be resolved by China's existing technical conditions are manufactured in domestic machine factories, thus increasing Ansteel's total domestic equipment orders by about two times compared to last year. Last year, Ansteel's domestic equipment orders were not submitted until May, while this year, agreements have been largely reached on equipment planned to be resolved domestically in January, and manufacturing contracts have already begun to be signed. Now, many departments have begun to take action. The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a meeting to specifically study and discuss the issue of manufacturing equipment orders for Ansteel. The Northeast First, Second, and Seventeenth Machine Factories, the Northeast Electric Industry Administration Bureau and its affiliated Fifth Electric Manufacturing Factory, Tangshan Machine Factory, etc., have also sent capable cadres and engineers to Ansteel according to the agreements signed with Ansteel to discuss the matter of undertaking the manufacture of equipment.
    Ansteel has adopted the experience of the Soviet Union and separated the equipment and material work of construction projects as early as the beginning of last year, establishing a strong professional organization—the Equipment Department—to manage this work. The establishment of this professional organization has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of Ansteel's heavy equipment work tasks. In the past, a small number of people regarded the extremely complex equipment preparation work as a simple buying and selling activity, thinking that it could be quickly purchased when needed. The leadership of Ansteel's Equipment Department promptly criticized this erroneous idea, and in the spring of last year, based on the preliminary design approved by the state, compiled a preliminary equipment plan for 1953 to 1955, and specifically proposed the delivery time of the equipment required in 1953 to the equipment manufacturing factories. In order to change the chaotic state of equipment management in the past, Ansteel's Equipment Department has also continuously implemented reforms in organizational structure and management system. For example, a foreign equipment ordering section was added to uniformly manage the foreign equipment work that was originally managed separately by various departments; specialized equipment management teams were also established in the planning section and warehouse departments based on engineering projects, and scientific management systems such as equipment summary tables and equipment cards were established. Last year, after Ansteel's Equipment Department signed contracts with equipment manufacturing factories, no one was responsible, which resulted in individual equipment not being delivered on schedule, affecting project progress. This year, they will organize dedicated personnel to regularly go to the machine factories manufacturing equipment to understand the equipment manufacturing situation and strengthen inspection work.
    In order to create better conditions for large-scale industrial construction in 1954 in terms of equipment work, Ansteel's Equipment Department has included the equipment needed in the first half of 1954 in the 1953 work plan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍山钢铁公司加紧进行工程设备准备工作
    随着今年大规模基本建设工程开工日益迫近，国营鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）大量工程设备的准备工作正在加速进行。现在，不分昼夜，都有满载着早在去年就向国内、国外订制的工程设备的火车，隆隆地驶进鞍钢储存设备的巨大仓库。按照目前鞍钢设备准备工作情况看来，过去因设备供应不及时而影响工程进度的现象，在今年将有显著改进。去年，上海、广州、长沙、太原、济南、沈阳、大连、齐齐哈尔等二十四个城市一百零七个机器厂和其他有关的七十九个企业单位，曾克服一切困难，给鞍钢如期或提前制造和供应了大量设备。今年鞍钢在设备订制中，凡是我国现有技术条件能够解决的，都在国内各机器厂制造，因而使鞍钢今年的国内设备订货总量比去年增加了两倍左右。去年，鞍钢的国内设备直到五月份才提出订货，而今年计划在国内解决的设备，在一月份就大部达成协议，并已开始签订制造合同。现在，许多部门业已开始行动起来。中央人民政府重工业部与第一机械工业部曾召开会议，专门研究和讨论了为鞍钢制造设备订货的问题。东北第一、第二、第十七机器厂，东北电器工业管理局及其所属第五电器制造厂，唐山机器厂等，也都根据和鞍钢签订的协议，派得力干部和工程师来鞍钢洽商了承造设备的事情。
    鞍钢接受了苏联的经验，早在去年年初，就把建筑工程的设备和材料工作分开，成立了强有力的专业机构——设备处来掌握这一工作。这个专业组织机构的成立，对保证完成鞍钢繁重设备工作任务起了重大作用。过去有少数人员把极为复杂的设备准备工作看成为简单的买卖活动，以为需用时可以很快买到。鞍钢设备处领导方面及时批判了这种错误思想，在去年春季就根据国家批准的初步设计，编制了一九五三年到一九五五年的初步设备计划，并向设备承造厂具体提出了一九五三年所需设备的交货时间。为改变过去设备管理上的混乱状态，鞍钢设备处还不断实行了组织机构和管理制度的改革。如增加了国外设备订货科，统一管理原来由各部门分散管理的国外设备工作；在计划科和仓库部门也分别建立了以工程为单位的专责设备管理小组，并建立了设备总表、设备卡片的科学管理制度等等。去年，鞍钢设备处由于和设备承造厂订完合同后就没有人负责，使得个别设备没有如期交货，影响了工程进度。今年他们将组织专人，经常到承造设备的各机器厂了解设备制造情况，加强检查工作。
    为了在设备工作上给一九五四年大规模的工业建设创造更好的条件，鞍钢设备处已把一九五四年上半年所需要的设备，列入了一九五三年的工作计划。（新华社）
