North and East China are actively carrying out the winter literacy campaign. The scale of this winter literacy campaign is very large. According to the statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Beijing (three provinces and one city) in the North China region alone, the number of students enrolled in winter literacy classes reached six million by the end of last year.

The characteristics of this winter literacy campaign are: while extensively carrying out the winter literacy campaign, key experiments of the quick literacy method were conducted in areas where conditions were fully available, actively creating conditions for carrying out the illiteracy elimination campaign in the future. In order to do these two tasks well at the same time, various places in North China held educational and cultural conferences in early November last year. Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces began actively promoting the principles of the winter literacy campaign and training teachers in mid-December to prepare for the winter literacy campaign. In Cang County, Hebei Province, each county concentrated on training 13,530 cultural and political teachers in late November. Subsequently, each county also held meetings of district and village cadres to solve the ideological problems of the cadres and to arrange the winter literacy campaign. The specific practice in the villages was: on the one hand, in-depth publicity and education work was carried out among the masses, focusing on solving the problem of farmers waiting to participate in quick literacy classes instead of being willing to participate in people's schools. Cadres, party members, and members of the Communist Youth League led the masses to participate in winter literacy learning. On the other hand, they actively prepared winter literacy classrooms and teaching aids. Village cadres relied on the masses to solve problems such as classrooms, tables, benches, and oil lamps. By December 10, most villages in twelve counties and towns in Cang County had started school, and 280,000 farmers participated in the winter literacy campaign.

The current problems in the winter literacy campaign are: some cadres do not resolutely implement the principle of "vigorously carrying out the winter literacy campaign and focusing on promoting the quick literacy method," and are keen on experimental work to eliminate illiteracy, neglecting the leadership of the winter literacy campaign. These cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the major tasks of the winter literacy campaign, nor do they have sufficient understanding of the arduousness of the illiteracy elimination work. They mistakenly believe that "winter literacy classes are held every year, but they don't solve the problem. If we want to do it, we should do the quick literacy method," or they think that "the winter literacy task is small, the work is simple, the masses have experience, there are few people and the quality of teachers is poor, it doesn't matter much, we can still start." They do not assess the subjective and objective conditions, and open quick literacy classes everywhere without experience or sufficient preparation. As a result, neither task is done well. Zibo Prefecture in Shandong Province is an example: by November last year, the prefecture had opened 969 quick literacy classes in 617 townships, and almost every township in Zhangqiu and Zhangli counties had quick literacy classes. As a result, the winter literacy campaign developed extremely slowly. What should have been done was not done, and what had been done was not the responsibility of anyone. The county and district leading cadres were distracted, having to clean up the chaotic situation of the winter literacy campaign without leadership, and also having to take care of the scattered quick literacy classes, so that even the quick literacy classes were not done well. The phenomena of "falling behind," "half-baked," and "relapsing" are very serious, and some quick literacy classes have even been suspended halfway, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. Nanan County in Fujian is another example: the leading cadres in this county generally have the idea of "valuing quick literacy, abandoning people's schools, and ignoring winter literacy." When arranging winter literacy tasks and allocating cadre forces, the strong cadres and teachers were sent to engage in quick literacy classes, so the remaining teachers had the wrong ideas such as "winter literacy is old and backward" and were unwilling to teach winter literacy. After discovering this phenomenon, the leading cadres in these two regions, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, vigorously publicized the principles of the winter literacy campaign and widely mobilized the masses to attend winter literacy classes. At the same time, they consolidated people's schools and opened quick literacy classes with emphasis according to the actual strength, so that the learning movement turned to the road of normal development. However, in other areas, the phenomenon of cadres neglecting the leadership of winter literacy is still serious and urgently needs to be corrected.

The masses' thinking of "waiting for quick success" and unwillingness to attend winter literacy classes seriously hinders the development of the winter literacy campaign. Some people in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, said: "Quick success in two days learns three hundred words, and two years of winter literacy is only three hundred words. If the quick success class is not opened, I will not attend winter literacy classes." The masses in Liujiazhuang, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, said: "Quick literacy is a train, and winter literacy is a bullock cart. If there is a train, who would still take a bullock cart?" Some people in Wendeng Prefecture, Shandong Province, said: "It's a strange thing that they don't let us learn fast, but they want us to learn slow! I won't attend winter literacy classes no matter what, I'll wait for quick success!" Some farmers in Hai Dian Town in the suburbs of Beijing tore up the newly bought books when they heard that the quick literacy class was not opened. The reason for this situation is mainly that the cadres did not properly publicize the Central Committee's principles on the winter literacy campaign, but were keen on key experiments in quick literacy. Experience in various places proves that as long as the cadres' thinking is changed and the principles of the winter literacy campaign are clearly explained to the masses, the masses' thinking is relatively easy to change. For example, after the cadres in some areas changed their thinking, they organized students in quick literacy classes to publicize to the masses: Those who have attended winter literacy or already know a few words will learn faster in quick literacy learning than those who have not attended winter literacy or do not know a word. The masses understood that attending winter literacy was not a waste of time, and they entered winter literacy learning with peace of mind. After listening to the cadres' propaganda, students in Majiabao in the suburbs of Beijing said, "Why didn't you explain this earlier? Wouldn't it have been okay if you said it earlier?" The masses in Fengtai said: "The government is thinking of us everywhere, which is better than going wrong halfway." Women in Niuhuangkou Village, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, knew that eliminating semi-literacy was easier than eliminating pure illiteracy, and said: "We will lay a foundation by attending winter literacy this year, and then quick success next year." All localities should refer to the experience in this regard and seriously solve the ideological problems of the masses in order to bring the winter literacy campaign into a normal track.

    华北华东积极开展冬学运动
    干部忽视冬学、群众等待速成的现象应即纠正
    华北、华东两区正在积极开展冬学运动。这次冬学运动的规模是很大的，仅据华北区的河北、山西、绥远和北京三省一市的统计，到去年年底为止，冬学入学人数已达六百万人。
    这次冬学运动的特点是：和广泛开展冬学运动同时，在条件已经充分具备的地区进行了速成识字法的重点试验，积极为今后开展扫除文盲运动创造条件。为了把这两项工作同时做好，华北各地早在去年十一月上旬就先后举行了文教会议。浙江、安徽等省在十二月中旬开始，就积极宣传冬学运动的方针和进行训练师资等冬学准备工作。河北沧县专区各县在十一月下旬集中训练了一万三千五百三十名文化教师和政治教师。接着，各县又先后召开了区、村干部会议，解决干部思想问题，布置冬学运动。在村子里的具体做法是：一方面向群众进行深入的宣传教育工作，着重解决农民等待参加速成识字班学习而不愿参加民校学习的思想，干部、党员、团员带动群众参加冬学学习；一方面积极准备冬学的教室和教学用具，村干部依靠群众解决教室、桌子、凳子、油灯等问题。到十二月十日，沧县专区就有十二个县镇的大部分村庄开了学，二十八万农民参加了冬季学习运动。
    当前冬学运动中存在的问题是：有些干部不坚决执行“大力开展冬学运动，重点推行速成识字法”的方针，热中于扫除文盲的实验工作，忽视对于冬学运动的领导。这些干部对于冬学运动的重大任务认识不足，对于扫除文盲工作的艰巨性也认识不足，他们错误地认为“冬学年年办，不解决问题，要搞就搞速成识字法”，或者认为：“冬学任务小，工作简单，群众有经验，人少和教师质量差，没有多大关系，照样可以搞开。”他们不估计主客观条件，在没有经验、没有充分准备的情况下，到处开办速成识字班。这样做的结果是两方面的工作都没有做好。山东省淄博专区是一个例子：这个专区到去年十一月份为止，已在六百一十七个乡内，开办了九百六十九个速成识字班，而章邱、章历两县几乎乡乡都有速成识字班。这一来，冬学运动开展得就极为迟缓了，该办的没办，已办的无人负责。县、区领导干部则顾此失彼，又要收拾冬学无人领导的混乱局面，又要照顾分散的速成识字班，于是连速成识字班也没有办好。“掉队”、“夹生”、“回生”现象很严重，有的速成班甚至中途停办，群众大为不满。福建南安县又是一个例子：这个县的领导干部普遍存在着“重视速成，放弃民校，不管冬学”的思想，在布置冬学任务和配备干部力量的时候，把强有力的干部和教师都派去搞速成识字班，因之其余的教师产生了“冬学是旧的、落后的”等错误思想，不愿教冬学。这两个地区的领导干部在发现了这种现象以后，根据中央指示，一面大力宣传冬学运动的方针，广泛发动群众上冬学；一面巩固民校，并根据实际力量，有重点地开办速成识字班，这样才使学习运动转入正常发展的道路。但是，在另外的一些地区，干部忽视冬学领导的现象仍然严重存在，急需纠正。
    群众中“等待速成”、不愿上冬学的思想，也严重地阻碍了冬学运动的开展。山西省闻喜县有的群众说：“两天速成学三百字，两年冬学也不过认三百字，不开速成班，冬学我也不上。”山西省寿阳县刘家庄群众说：“速成识字是火车，冬学是牛车，有了火车谁还坐牛车。”山东省文登专区有的群众说：“真怪事，有快的不让学，偏叫学慢的！俺高低不上冬学，要等着速成！”北京郊区海淀镇有的农民听说不开速成识字班，把新买的书也撕掉了。造成这种情况的原因，主要是干部没有好好宣传中央关于冬学运动的方针，而热中于速成识字的重点试验。各地经验证明：只要干部思想扭转了，并把冬学运动的方针向群众交代明白，群众思想是比较易于扭转的。例如有的地区的干部在自己的思想扭转以后，曾组织速成识字班学员向群众宣传：上过冬学或已经认得少数字的，在速成学习中，要比没有上过冬学或一字不识的人学起来快得多。群众明白了上冬学并不白费，就很安心地进入冬学学习。北京市郊区马家堡学员听了干部宣传以后，说：“你们为什么不早说明这个道理呢？早点说不早就没有事了吗？”丰台群众说：政府处处为咱们，这比上半截出岔子强多了。山西寿阳县牛黄口村妇女知道扫除    半文盲比扫除纯文盲容易之后，都说：今年上冬学打个底，明年再速成。各地应该参照这方面的经验，认真解决群众的思想问题，以便把冬学运动引入正常轨道。
