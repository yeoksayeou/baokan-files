Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Representatives of eighteen religious groups gathered in Beijing yesterday to protest the Eisenhower government's deliberate murder of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The attending representatives unanimously passed a protest letter demanding that the U.S. government revoke the Rosenbergs' sentences and restore their freedom.

The protest letter stated: Eisenhower, disregarding the protests of righteous people in the United States and around the world, stubbornly rejected the Rosenbergs' appeals and was determined to execute this pair of kind American citizens. This brutal decision thoroughly exposed the false mask of America's so-called "democracy" and "peace." The U.S. government is attempting to intensify war preparations and fascist rule by using anti-Soviet propaganda and massacring peace fighters.

The protest letter said to Christians in the United States: "We expect you to take more active action to save the lives of the Rosenbergs and save human justice."

The protest letter finally warned Eisenhower: "If you dare to ignore the will of righteous people around the world and shed the blood of innocent people, you will not escape the judgment of God and the people."

The following organizations signed the protest letter: Beijing Methodist Church of the Chinese Christian Church, North China Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church, Hebei Association of the Chinese Christian Church, North China Christian Congregational Church, North China Union of Seventh-day Adventist Church, Chinese Salvation Army, North China District Council of the Assemblies of God in China, Beijing Christian Assembly Place, General Association of the Chinese Holy Church, General Assembly of the True Jesus Church, General Association of the Holy City New Church, Beijing Christian Family Evangelistic Fellowship, Beijing YMCA, Beijing YWCA, Yenching School of Religion, Beijing Seminary, Beijing Union Women's Holy Doctrine College, and Tianjia Bimonthly Magazine.

    十八个宗教团体的代表在北京集会抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意杀害罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社二十日讯】十八个宗教团体的代表昨日在北京集会，抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意杀害罗森堡夫妇。到会代表一致通过了一项抗议书，要求美国政府撤销对罗森堡夫妇的判决并恢复他们的自由。
    抗议书说：艾森豪威尔不顾美国国内和全世界各国正义人民的抗议，蛮横地拒绝罗森堡夫妇的申诉，决意将这一对善良的美国公民处死刑。这一残暴决定彻底揭穿了美国的所谓“民主”、“和平”的假面具。美国政府是企图用反苏宣传，屠杀和平战士的办法，来加紧战争准备和法西斯统治。
    抗议书对美国的基督徒说：“我们期待你们更积极地行动起来，拯救罗森堡夫妇的生命，拯救人类的正义。”
    抗议书最后警告艾森豪威尔：“如果你胆敢忽视全世界正义人民的意志而流无辜人民的血，你一定逃不掉上帝和人民的审判。”
