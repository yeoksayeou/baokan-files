    Combining Rural Party Rectification Work to Correct Commandism

    The Party Rectification Work Team of Tianzhu Village in Shunyi County, during the Party rectification process, educated party members in communism and the Communist Party, examined and criticized commandist work styles, and initially established a democratic work style of consulting with the masses on issues. This experience is very good and worthy of emulation by other regions.

    From the experience of Shunyi County, we should understand that in correcting the commandism of grassroots cadres, we must first thoroughly examine the bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles of the leadership that are inconsiderate of the actual difficulties of village cadres. Then, we should examine the commandism of village cadres, and educate party members and cadres with real people and real events, teaching them to learn the working methods of the mass line. In this way, grassroots cadres can be convinced to conduct self-criticism willingly. If this is not done, it will not only fail to correct the commandism of grassroots cadres but will also cause negative emotions among them. In fact, the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership are indeed serious and have indeed fueled the commandism of grassroots cadres. To thoroughly correct the commandism of grassroots cadres, we must first examine and correct the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leading organs.

    When correcting the commandism of grassroots cadres, it is necessary to conduct thorough ideological education for them, patiently explaining that this commandist work style hinders the implementation of the Party's policies, leads to bad results from good intentions, causes a lot of suffering to the masses, and seriously damages the relationship between the Party and the masses. We must also educate party members with actual examples, teaching them to learn the methods of the mass line and establish the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people. Only in this way can party members consciously examine and correct their own commandist work styles.

    What is commandism, and what is not commandism? This is also an issue that needs to be clarified among grassroots cadres. We believe that any method that, in order to complete tasks assigned by higher authorities, does not take into account the actual situation, does not explain the reasons to the masses, but adopts hasty, crude, simplistic, and rigid approaches, violates the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, and forces the masses to act, is commandism. However, when grassroots cadres use the methods of the mass line to mobilize and urge the masses to complete certain administrative or emergency tasks (such as flood prevention, locust extermination), or to implement resolutions of the masses, and provide criticism and education or force compliance on individual lawbreakers, this should not be regarded as commandism.

    In handling the issue of commandism among rural party members and cadres, in order to truly correct mistakes without harming the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres, we must be realistic, clarify responsibilities, and treat different situations differently. For general grassroots cadres, due to their low level of understanding, limited methods, especially when there is too much work, urgent tasks, and a lack of specific guidance and assistance from higher authorities, and commandism occurs in their work (such as bad attitudes, inappropriate methods), the main focus should be on strengthening education so that they can consciously examine and correct their mistakes. Individuals whose actions are serious, causing serious damage to the property and physical well-being of the masses, should be given appropriate punishment. If the leadership's actions have caused grassroots cadres to commit commandist errors, the leadership should not simply blame the grassroots cadres, but should first examine themselves. As for those who arbitrarily violate human rights, drive people to their deaths, or abuse their power for personal gain, they must be treated as violating laws and discipline, expelled from the Party, and punished according to law.

### 结合农村整党工作  纠正强迫命令作风

    结合农村整党工作  纠正强迫命令作风
    顺义县天竺村整党工作组，在整党中对党员进行了共产主义和共产党的教育，检查和批判了强迫命令的作风，初步树立了有事和群众商量的民主作风。这个经验很好，值得各地学习。
    从顺义县的经验中，我们应该了解：在纠正基层干部的强迫命令时，必须首先深刻地检查领导方面的官僚主义和不体贴村干部实际困难的主观主义作风；然后再检查村干部的强迫命令作风，并以活人活事教育党员干部，学习走群众路线的工作方法。这样就能使基层干部和党员心悦诚服地进行检讨。如果不这样做就不但不能纠正基层干部的强迫命令作风，还会使基层干部产生消极情绪。事实上，领导方面的官僚主义和主观主义的确是严重的，也的确助长了基层干部的强迫命令作风。要想彻底纠正基层干部的强迫命令作风，就必须首先检查和纠正领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义。
    在纠正基层干部的强迫命令作风时，要向基层干部进行充分的思想教育，耐心地说明这种强迫命令作风阻碍了党的政策的贯彻，好的愿望得到坏的结果，给群众造成了很多疾苦，使党和群众的联系受到了严重的破坏，并以实际事例教育党员，学习走群众路线的方法，树立起全心全意为人民服务的观点。这样才能使党员自觉地检查、纠正自己的强迫命令作风。
    什么是强迫命令作风，什么不是强迫命令作风，这也是需要在基层干部中弄清楚的问题。我们认为凡是为完成上级任务，不根据实际情况，不向群众讲明道理，而采取急躁、粗暴、简单、生硬的办法，违反群众自愿的原则，强制群众行动的，都是强迫命令作风。但基层干部采用群众路线的方法，动员并督促群众完成一定的行政任务或紧急任务（如防汛、灭蝗）或贯彻群众决议时，而对个别违法分子给以批评教育或强制其执行的，就不应该看成强迫命令作风。
    在处理农村党员与干部的强迫命令问题时，为了切实做到既能纠正错误又不伤害基层干部的积极性，必须实事求是，责任分明，并按照不同情况，分别对待。对一般基层干部，由于水平低，办法少，特别是工作多，任务急，上级又缺乏具体指导和具体帮助，而在工作中发生强迫命令现象（如态度不好、方法不当）者，主要是加强教育，使其自觉地检查和纠正错误。对个别情节严重，使群众在财产和身体上受到严重损害者，则应给以适当的处分。由于领导方面的原因使基层干部犯了强迫命令的错误，领导方面不应单纯责难基层干部，而应首先检查自己。对于恣意侵犯人权、逼死人命或利用职权为非作歹的人，必须以违法乱纪论处，开除其党籍，并依法惩办。
