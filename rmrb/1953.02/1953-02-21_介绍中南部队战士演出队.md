Introducing the Soldiers' Performance Team of the Central and Southern Military Region
Bi Gefei

    The 350th Regiment of the Central and Southern Military Region produced fourteen excellent soldier programs during the "August 1st" literary and artistic competition in 1952. Afterwards, based on the actors of these fourteen programs, a soldiers' performance team was formed to tour various units, in order to promote the company-level cultural activities of the entire army. The soldiers' performance team has a total of sixty-nine people, including: one deputy company commander, one teaching assistant, twenty-two squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, and forty-five soldiers. In the past, most of them were illiterate. After more than half a year of cultural studies, more than 90% reached the level of graduating from higher primary school. Among them, forty-five have been commended for their meritorious service in combat, cultural studies, daily work, and literary and artistic activities. They toured the troops of the Central and Southern Military Region a total of seventy-seven times, and were well received by the audience and commended and praised by the leaders of the military region. Their programs are all self-written, self-directed, and self-performed. They have relatively outstanding achievements in directing and performing, providing a vivid example for company-level cultural activities and driving the company-level cultural activities of the entire army.

    Most of the members of the soldiers' performance team are heroes, models, Party members, and Youth League members. They are a bridge connecting the company leadership with the masses. They are always concerned about improving the ideological awareness of their comrades and completing various tasks. Therefore, the purpose of their creations is very clear and practical. The theme of each work starts from the urgent needs of the masses. For example, new soldiers in the company all like glory, but they don't understand how glory comes about. The soldiers' performance team created "Hero Song Sheng" based on the deeds of Song Sheng, a combat hero who had performed seven major meritorious services in the War of Liberation and attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives. The vivid image helps new comrades understand that glory is won through arduous struggle, inspires old comrades to recall and cherish their glorious history, and encourages everyone to create new glory together in cultural studies and in the struggle to defend the motherland.

    Their creative themes are very broad and multifaceted, breaking through the narrow circle of only writing about current tasks and only writing about combat. They reflect combat heroes ("Hero Song Sheng"), and also reflect models in various work positions ("Happy Cook," "Horse Herding Dance"); they praise the glorious history of the company ("Waist-Cutting of the Seventh Army"), and also express the future and ideals of the troops ("Study Culture Well and Embark on Modernization"); they reflect cultural studies ("Wang Gui Group"), and also reflect international events ("Big Cannon Firing at American Imperialists"). Their literary and artistic programs start from reflecting various themes, and focus on one point – enlivening the troops and educating the troops. Just like organizing firepower in combat, firearms are highly dispersed, and firepower is highly concentrated. Therefore, their performances not only promoted cultural studies, but also inspired the fighting will to defend the motherland and defend world peace. Their literary and artistic activities are closely combined with the current central tasks, and also combined with the basic task of building a modern national defense force. This is the first characteristic of the soldiers' performance team.

    They are very bold and careful in their creations, and they all understand that the works should highlight the key points and grasp the center, and not allow messy things to dilute the theme. They focus on portraying characters, and dare to boldly cut and concentrate. Writing "Hero Song Sheng" abandons the "displaying all the family assets" approach, but concentrates firepower, only showing his battle at the Minquanmen in Tianjin, and deleting all other battle processes; in the creation of the "Wang Gui Group" living cartoon, they further broke through the limitations of real people and real events, boldly adding the story of another mutual aid group - a comrade broke his foot while studying, and in order to prevent the whole group from "falling behind," the group leader carried him to class, thus enhancing the performance effect of the living cartoon. Although they are bold, they are not hasty, but very careful. For example, in "Big Cannon Firing at American Imperialists," the soldiers dressed as American devils, and the chest badge of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was still exposed on their chests. They felt that this was very unserious, so they came up with the idea of turning the pockets over to cover the chest badge, which not only made up for the shortcomings, but also strengthened the image of the enemy. They carefully consider every action and every image, and constantly revise them according to the opinions of the masses during the performance. Their creative attitude is very serious. This is the second characteristic of the soldiers' performance team.

    The dances and singing movements of the soldiers' performance team are very agile, vigorous, simple, and beautiful, and they are best at using actions to express problems. They call it "using actions to speak." For example, "Hero Song Sheng" has these lines:
    "No matter how many enemies there are, no matter how strong the fortifications are. Barbed wire, deer traps, caltrops, blow them all to smithereens in one go." When singing, two people hold hands with their legs bent forward and backward to imitate barbed wire. One person uses a gun as a blasting tube and leans against the barbed wire. As soon as he pulls the fuse, he quickly turns around and hides. With a "boom," the two people sit down in response, while still maintaining a majestic posture, which shows that the barbed wire has been destroyed without damaging the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army. This action sounds very simple, but the beauty lies in the fact that they perform such simple actions very realistically and beautifully. Not only are each action simple and beautiful, but also the connection between the actions is very tight. After blasting the barbed wire, everyone sings: "Blasted open the breakthrough, occupied the forward position and consolidated the position, the action is fast and fierce, fast and fierce, our comrades are so heroic." The demolition man rushes forward from the breakthrough, and the two people who were acting as barbed wire take turns advancing with him. Their singing, every sentence of the lyrics is performed with movements close to dance according to the needs of the emotion, actually it is a simple song and dance. Their actions can fully express the thoughts and feelings of the characters. For example, "Race Dance," from the external appearance of the movements of the three people, they are basically the same, but because the inner thoughts and emotions of each person are different, the actions have different degrees of slowness and urgency, thus giving this action three different personalities. People can clearly feel at a glance: one is complacent in the middle and fails, one persists to the end and wins, and one is flustered and affects the progress. When expressing heroic behavior, it makes people feel that he is both heroic and tenacious, and also has a sense of the enemy's situation, unlike some actors who express heroic and tenacious, making people feel that he is a reckless person who does not hesitate to make unnecessary sacrifices. Their dances and singing are full of the soldiers' pride and optimism in loving the revolutionary cause. Like "Happy Cook," it is not a blind respect for their profession, but is guided by lofty thoughts and great ideals. Under the education of the Party, in the practice of struggle, they deeply realize that the results of their hard work benefit the people, so they feel that their work is meaningful and promising, thus generating love, happiness, and heroic behavior. Based on this inner true emotion, carrying out realistic creation is their third characteristic.

    The programs of the soldiers' performance team are short, concise, lively, and diverse. There are singing, dancing, clapper talk, cartoons, accordion ensembles, string ensembles, and also sports skill performances, etc. They have made achievements in accepting the heritage of folk dances and folk songs. Like "Yangko Dance," they widely absorb a variety of movements from folk dances, dragon lanterns, pushing carts, blowing trumpets, playing acrobatics... The patterns are new and the emotions are real, making people feel extraordinarily cordial after watching it. It breaks through the old twisting method of "three steps forward and one step back," and combines it with real life for processing and creation. Therefore, it not only has a strong national color, but also expresses the patriotic and optimistic mood of the People's Liberation Army. Most of the songs and dances are accompanied by percussion instruments, and most of the dance music is selected from folk tunes. These enhance the national style of the programs, and thus are more popular with the general audience. This is their fourth characteristic.

    The programs of the soldiers' performance team are not only popular, but also popular to learn from. After watching the performance, each company held a discussion, and regarded the soldiers' performance team as a mirror to check the literary and artistic activities of their own company. A certain regiment's 7th company previously created a "Fishermen's Dance" and even won an award. Comparing it with the dance of the soldiers' performance team, they discovered that there were still serious shortcomings in the theme: the dance only simply reflected the life of fishermen fishing, but in fact, the life of fishermen after liberation is inseparable from the protection of the national defense army. Therefore, they planned to revise it into a dance with the theme of national defense soldiers protecting fishermen's production, so that it can be combined with the education center. The literary and artistic activities of a certain regiment's 6th company used to be good, but later they couldn't come up with anything new, so they became depressed. This time, after watching the performance of the soldiers' performance team, they learned a lot and were greatly encouraged, just like meeting sweet spring when thirsty, which is both timely and solves the problem. With this momentum, literary and artistic activities were once again carried out enthusiastically. The soldiers' performance team, like "lighting a fire," quickly pushed the company-level literary and artistic activities forward, giving everyone a lesson and making everyone realize what is the combat-oriented and mass-oriented literary and artistic policy.

    介绍中南部队战士演出队
    毕革飞
    中南军区三五○部队，在一九五二年“八一”文艺比赛演出中，产生了十四个优秀的战士节目。以后，以这十四个节目的演员为基础，组成战士演出队到各个部队巡回演出，借以推动全军的连队文艺活动。战士演出队共六十九人，包括：副连长一人、助教一人，正、副班长二十二人、战士四十五人。他们过去多数是文盲，经过半年多的文化学习，百分之九十以上达到了高小毕业程度。其中有四十五人分别在战斗中、文化学习中、日常工作中、文艺活动中立过功。他们在中南军区部队巡回演出共七十七次，受到观众的好评，受到军区首长的嘉奖与表扬。他们的节目都是自编、自导、自演的，在编导表演方面都有较突出的成就，给连队文艺活动提供了生动的榜样，带动了全军的连队文艺活动。
    战士演出队的成员大多数是英雄模范、党员、团员，是连队领导与群众相联系的桥梁，他们时时刻刻关心着同志们思想觉悟的提高，关心着各种任务的完成。因此，他们的创作的目的性很明确很实际，每个作品的主题思想，都是从群众的迫切需要出发的。比如：连队里的新战士都喜欢光荣，可是不了解光荣是怎样来的。战士演出队便以在解放战争中立过七大功的、曾出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的战斗英雄宋生的事迹为题材，创作了“英雄宋生”，以生动的形象帮助新同志认识光荣是从艰苦斗争中争取来的，启发老同志回忆和珍惜自己的光荣历史，鼓励大家在文化学习中、在保卫祖国的斗争中，共同创造新的光荣。
    他们的创作题材是非常宽广多面的，突破了光写当前任务和光写战斗的狭小圈子。他们反映了战斗英雄（“英雄宋生”），也反映了各个工作岗位上的模范（“快乐的炊事员”“放马舞”）；歌颂了连队的光荣历史（“腰斩七军”），也表现了部队的前途与理想（“学好文化走上现代化”）；反映了文化学习（“王贵小组”），也反映了国际大事（“大炮打美帝”）。他们的文艺节目是从反映各方面题材下手，又集中地围绕着一点——活跃部队、教育部队。正像打仗组织火力一样，火器高度分散，火力高度集中。因此，他们的演出不仅推动了文化学习，同时也鼓舞了保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的战斗意志。他们的文艺活动，既紧密结合了当前的中心任务，又结合了建设现代化国防军的基本任务。这是战士演出队的第一个特点。
    他们在创作上非常大胆而细心，都懂得作品要突出重点，抓住中心，不要叫乱七八糟的东西冲淡了主题思想。他们着重刻划人物，敢于大胆剪裁集中。写“英雄宋生”就抛弃了那种“摆全部家当”的写法，而是集中火力，单表他在天津民权门的战斗，把其他几次战斗过程全部删去了；在“王贵小组”活洋片的创作中，他们更进一步打破了真人真事的局限，大胆地把另一个互助小组的事情——一个同志在学习中跌坏了脚，为了全组没一个“掉队”的，小组长背他去上课的场面，也写到里边来，因而增强了活洋片的演出效果。他们虽然大胆，可是并不草率，而是非常细心的。比如“大炮打美帝”中，战士化装美国鬼子，胸前还露着中国人民解放军的胸章，他们觉得这样很不严肃，就想出了把衣兜翻过来盖着胸章的办法，不仅弥补了缺点，并且加强了敌人的形象。他们创造每一个动作每一个形象，都经过认真的推敲，并在演出中根据群众意见不断进行修改，他们的创作态度是非常严肃的。这是战士演出队的第二个特点。
    战士演出队的舞蹈和演唱动作非常敏捷、矫健、朴素、美丽，最善于用动作表现问题，他们叫做“用动作说话”。比如“英雄宋生”中有这样几句唱词：
    “不管它敌人有多少，不管它工事钢一般。铁丝网、鹿砦、梅花桩，一气给它炸个翻。”演唱时候，两个人两腿前弓后蹬拉着手比做铁丝网。一个人以枪当爆破筒靠在铁丝网上，一拉火就迅速转身隐蔽，“轰隆”一声，两人应声坐下，上身仍保持雄壮的姿态，这样既表现出铁丝网被炸毁，又无损解放军的英雄形象。说起来这个动作很简单，妙在他们把这样朴素的动作表现得非常逼真而优美，不仅各个动作朴素优美，并且动作间的互相衔接也很紧凑。炸翻铁丝网后，大家唱着：“炸开了突破口，占领了前沿巩固阵地，动作快又猛，快又猛，我们的同志真英勇。”爆破手从突破口当中冲向前去，装铁丝网的两个人跟他交替前进。他们的演唱，每一句唱词都根据感情的需要用接近舞蹈化的动作表演出来，实际上已是一种朴素的歌舞。他们的动作能充分的表达人物的思想感情。比如“赛跑舞”，从三个人动作的外表看来基本上是一样的，但由于各人内心思想情感不同，就使动作发生了缓急的变化，从而赋予这一动作三种不同的个性。人们一看，就鲜明地感觉到：一个中途自满遭到失败，一个始终不懈取得优胜，一个张惶失措影响了前进。在表现英雄行为的时候，使人感到他既英勇顽强，又有敌情观念，不像有些演员表现英勇顽强，使人感到他是个不惜无谓牺牲的冒失鬼。他们的舞蹈、演唱充满着战士热爱革命事业的自豪的乐观情绪，像“快乐的炊事员”，并不是盲目的尊重自己的职业，而是被崇高的思想、伟大的理想指导着的。他们在党的教育下，在斗争的实践中，深刻地认识到自己努力工作的结果给了人民益处，因此感到自己的工作
    有意义有前途，从而产生了热爱、快乐和英雄行为。在这种内心真实情感的基础上，进行现实主义的创作，这是他们的第三个特点。
    战士演出队的节目短小精悍，形式活泼多样，有演唱、舞蹈、快板、洋片、手风琴合奏、弦乐合奏，还有体育技术表演等等。在接受民间舞蹈、民歌的遗产上做的有成绩。像“秧歌舞”，广泛地吸取了民间舞蹈中的多种多样动作，耍龙灯、推小车、吹喇叭、玩杂耍………花样翻新，感情真实，使人看了感到分外亲切，突破了“进三步退一步”的老扭法，结合现实生活进行了加工创造。因而，既有浓厚的民族色彩，又表现出人民解放军爱国主义的乐观情绪。在大部分的演唱与舞蹈中都配了打击乐器，舞曲也大都是选的民间曲子，这些都增强了节目的民族风格，因而更为广大观众喜闻乐见。这是他们的第四个特点。
    战士演出队的节目不仅大家喜欢看，大家还喜欢学。看完演出后，各连都开了座谈会，把战士演出队当一面镜子，对照着来检查自己连队的文艺活动。某团七连以前创作了个“渔民舞”，还得过奖，和战士演出队的舞蹈比较一下，发现了在主题思想上还存在着严重缺点：舞蹈中只是单纯反映了渔民打鱼的生活现象，实际上解放后的渔民生活是和国防军的护渔分不开的，因此，他们便准备把它修改成以国防战士保护渔民生产为主题的舞蹈，这样便和教育中心结合起来了。某团六连过去的文艺活动还好，后来搞不出什么名堂来了，就消沉下去了，这次看了战士演出队演出，学了好多东西，受到了很大鼓舞，正像口渴逢甘泉，又适时又解决问题，借这一股劲，文艺活动又热火朝天地搞起来了。战士演出队像“点了一把火”似的，把连队的文艺活动迅速地向前推进了一步，给大家上了一堂课，使大家认识到了什么是战斗性群众性的文艺方针。
