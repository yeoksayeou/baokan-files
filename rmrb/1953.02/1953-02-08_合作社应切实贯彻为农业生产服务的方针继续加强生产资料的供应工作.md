Cooperatives Should Conscientiously Implement the Policy of Serving Agricultural Production and Continue to Strengthen the Supply of Means of Production
Feng Yun

Improving agricultural technology is an important condition for increasing agricultural production. Cooperatives must promptly and adequately supply farmers with commercial fertilizers, new and old farm tools, pesticides, and pesticide application equipment to vigorously support the agricultural bumper harvest movement. In 1952, cooperatives across the country made great achievements in this regard.

In 1952, cooperatives across the country supplied more than 2.7 million tons of cake fertilizer and more than 370,000 tons of chemical fertilizers. This figure is equal to three times the total amount of fertilizer supplied by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives in 1951, which can increase the production value of grain or other cash crops by approximately 9 trillion yuan (this increase in production statistics includes the value of increased production from fertilizer supplied by cooperatives in the Northeast). Last year, cooperatives accepted the state's entrustment to supply farmers with large quantities of pesticides and pesticide application equipment. Cooperatives in nineteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoxi, purchased and prepared more than 46.6 million catties of various pesticides last year. Cooperatives in East China supplied 3.57 million catties of pesticides and more than 90,000 sprayers last year, saving more than 41 million mu of farmland affected by disasters. Many farmers in the above areas gratefully said: This year's cotton was snatched from the mouths of insects. Through the supply of pesticides and application equipment, the scientific concept of "no bumper harvest without pest control" has been established among farmers. Cooperatives in various places also achieved certain successes in the supply of farm tools last year. Last year, cooperatives in the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and the former Pingyuan Province supplied 97,000 new-style walking plows, 100,000 waterwheels, and more than 18 million other types of large and small farm tools. Last year, cooperatives in the Northeast also promoted 500 sets of new-style horse-drawn farm tools.

In 1952, the proportion of means of production supplied by cooperatives nationwide was: fertilizer accounted for 77.5 percent; farm tools accounted for 9.9 percent; pesticides and application equipment accounted for 3.3 percent; and others (livestock, seeds, etc.) accounted for 9.3 percent. This ratio shows that cooperatives in various regions have done a better job in fertilizer supply, while the supply of other means of production, especially farm tools, although there is a certain quantity, is obviously far from meeting the needs of the masses.

The supply of means of production by the cooperative system last year tells us that it is very necessary to strengthen the policy and ideological education of cooperative cadres. Some cooperative cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the glorious and important task of cooperatives serving production, and they often do not appear active enough in managing the means of production. They believe that managing means of production is "too cumbersome," "both troublesome and unprofitable," so they refuse to manage it under the pretext of lacking experience. The Tenth District Cooperative of Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, only assigned three cadres to manage fertilizers and farm tools. The director of the cooperative also said: "This is helping the county cooperative." Some cooperative cadres in certain areas of Henan Province believe that supplying means of production is the government's business. The above ideas are a manifestation of a lack of production perspective and mass perspective, which seriously hinders the smooth progress of the supply of means of production. We must oppose this wrong view and attach great importance to the supply of means of production. We must conscientiously investigate and understand the needs of farmer members, improve management and administration, so as to provide members with high-quality and low-priced means of production to the greatest extent possible.

To do a good job in the supply of means of production, it is also necessary to strengthen guidance in agricultural technology. If cadres who manage means of production do not understand technology (managing new-style farm tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and application equipment all require a certain amount of technical knowledge), they will not be able to break the conservative ideas of farmer members and smoothly promote various new-style farm tools, pesticides, etc. The Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative did a poor job in supplying new-style farm tools last year, completing only 10 percent of the original plan in the first half of the year. The main reason is that cooperative cadres do not understand technology, farmers dare not buy them, and a large number of new-style farm tools are piled up in warehouses and cannot play their due role. Zhang Fuxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, purchased Ceresan (pesticide) from the cooperative to mix with wheat seeds, but because they did not understand how to use it and made a mistake in the dosage, all 26 mu of wheat land mixed with the pesticide did not sprout. All of this has created difficulties in the supply of means of production and affected the promotion of new-style farm tools and pesticides. Therefore, in addition to having general knowledge of using new farm tools and pesticides, cooperative cadres must also work closely with agricultural technology departments to overcome this difficulty. In order to promote pesticides and application equipment, cooperatives in Dezhou, Huimin, and Jiaozhou Prefectures in Shandong Province trained 1,050 cadres from cooperatives at all levels last year. Last year, these trainees played a significant role in supplying pesticides and application equipment and guiding farmers in preparing pesticides and using sprayers, solving the problem of farmers not knowing how to use pesticides and application equipment. The masses responded well.

In the past, cooperatives also had a certain degree of blindness in managing means of production, which must be overcome. Last year, cooperatives in some areas only paid attention to the supply of pesticides and did not attach importance to the supply of pesticide application equipment, so that the pesticides could not play their due role. This caused great losses to cooperatives and farmers.

The above-mentioned issues related to the supply of means of production should attract the attention of cooperatives at all levels, and they should be carefully studied, experiences should be summarized, improvements should be made, and the supply of means of production this year should be further improved.

    合作社应切实贯彻为农业生产服务的方针继续加强生产资料的供应工作
    冯云
    改良农业技术，是增加农业生产的重要条件。合作社必须及时地、充分地对农民供应商品肥料、新旧农具、农药及农药械等，大力配合农业丰产运动。一九五二年全国各地合作社在这一方面有很大成绩。
    一九五二年合作社在全国范围内已供应二百七十多万吨饼肥和三十七万多吨化学肥料，这个数字等于一九五一年国营企业和合作社供应肥料总额的三倍，约可增产价值九万亿元的粮食或其它经济作物（这一增产统计数字包括东北区合作社供应肥料增产的价值在内）。合作社去年接受了国家委托，大量供应农民以农药、农药械。河北、山东、辽西等十九个省市的合作社去年购备各种农药四千六百多万斤；华东区合作社去年供应农药三百五十七万斤、喷雾器九万多架，救出受灾农田四千一百多万亩。上述地区很多农民感激地说：今年的棉花是由虫子嘴里夺出来的。通过农药械的供应，已在农民当中树立起
    “要丰产必须治虫”的科学观念。各地合作社去年在农具的供应上也取得了一定成绩。山东、河南、山西、陕西和前平原省五个省的合作社去年即供应了九万七千多部新式步犁、十万架水车和一千八百多万件其他种类的大、小农具。东北区合作社去年还推销了五百套新式马拉农具。
    一九五二年全国合作社的生产资料供应比例是：肥料占百分之七十七点五；农具占百分之九点九；农药械占百分之三点三；其他（牲畜、种籽等）占百分之九点三。这个比例数字说明各地合作社在肥料供应上是做得较好的，而其它生产资料、特别是农具的供应，虽然也有一定数量，但这显然和群众的需要还差得很远。
    去年合作社系统的生产资料供应工作告诉我们，加强对合作社干部的政策思想教育是十分必要的。有一部分合作社干部对合作社为生产服务的光荣而重大的任务认识不够，在经营生产资料工作上常常表现得不够积极。他们认为经营生产资料“太笨重”，“既麻烦又不赚钱”，因此就借口没有经验而不愿去经营。四川省内江县十区合作社仅抽出三个干部经营肥料、农具，该社主任还说：“这是帮县社的忙。“河南省某些地区的合作社干部认为供应生产资料是政府的事。上述思想是生产观点和群众观点不强的表现，它严重地障碍着生产资料供应工作的顺利进行。我们必须反对这种错误看法，应当十分重视生产资料的供应工作。要认真调查了解农民社员的需要，改善经营管理，以便最大限度地供给社员物美价廉的生产资料。
    做好生产资料的供应工作，还必须加强农业技术的指导。经营生产资料的干部不懂得技术（经营新式农具、化学肥料、农药械等都需要有一定的技术知识），也就不能打破农民社员的保守思想，顺利地推销各种新式农具、农药等。前平原省合作社去年供应新式农具的工作做得不好，上半年仅完成原订计划的百分之十。主要的原因是合作社干部不懂技术，农民不敢买，大批新式农具只好积压在仓库里，不能发挥应有的效能。山东胶县张福祥农业生产合作社向合作社购买赛力散（农药）拌麦种，因为不懂得用法，弄错了用药量，结果用药拌种的二十六亩小麦地全没出苗。这都给供应生产资料工作造成困难，影响了对新式农具、农药的推广。因此，合作社干部除应具备一般的使用新农具、农药的知识，还必须与农业技术部门紧密配合来克服这个困难。山东德州、惠民、胶州专区合作社为了推广农药械，去年已训练了各级合作社干部一千零五十人。这些受训人员去年在供应农药械、指导农民配制农药和使用喷雾器等技术上都起了很大作用，解决了农民不会使用农药械的困难。群众反映很好。
    合作社过去在经营生产资料中，还存在一定程度的盲目性，这是必须克服的。去年有些地区的合作社只注意了农药供应，而没有重视药械供应，以致使农药也不能发挥应有的效用。这对合作社、农民都有很大损失。
    上述有关生产资料供应工作中的几个问题，应当引起各级合作社的注意，并认真研究，总结经验，加以改进，把今年生产资料供应工作再提高一步。
