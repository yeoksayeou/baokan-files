(Editor's Note: The experience of the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee in leading basic construction is basically successful. The Harbin Municipal Committee not only resolutely and rapidly improved the leadership structure and unified the leadership ideology, but also promptly solved the key problems in the process of basic construction work, and paid attention to regular political propaganda work. This specifically and practically implemented the policy of "placing basic construction in the primary position" and ensured the completion of the national plan. At present, many Party committees lack such experience. Therefore, it is very necessary to absorb the experience of the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee to improve the leadership of basic construction.)

    **Strengthening the Leadership Organization and Unifying Leadership Thinking**

    At the end of 1952, the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee gathered more than a hundred cadres and spent two and a half months summarizing the experience of basic construction work over the past year from bottom to top.

    Harbin's basic construction task in 1952 was a total of 698,000 square meters. The task was huge, but the construction started very late. In May, the construction season had arrived, but the vast majority of projects had not yet started. The Harbin Municipal Committee had no dedicated cadres for basic construction, and many cadres did not have a clear understanding that basic construction was a major national undertaking for centuries to come. Some units were unwilling to transfer cadres, especially good cadres, to basic construction departments. These situations seriously affected the progress of basic construction. Therefore, the Harbin Municipal Committee concentrated its efforts to quickly solve the following problems:

    First, strengthen the leadership organization and unify leadership thinking. First, establish and strengthen the city's Basic Construction Committee, with the participation of responsible comrades from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, in order to unify work steps; at the same time, the Basic Construction Work Division was established in the Industry Department of the Municipal Committee to specifically handle Party work in basic construction, and the Basic Construction Work Group was established in the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee to uniformly lead the propaganda and education work of workers throughout the city's construction sites. In order to effectively ensure the completion of the project task, the Municipal Committee clearly determined that the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League systems should focus on construction site work, and the majority of work cadres should be placed on construction sites, and grassroots organizations should be established on the construction sites. All work arrangements and inspections were carried out jointly under a unified plan and leadership. This not only avoided the problem of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League offsetting each other's strengths, but also fully exerted the Party's unified leadership and solved all important problems in the work regularly and promptly.

    Second, the Municipal Committee decided to use several important construction sites such as the Harbin Institute of Technology (a seven-story building with more than 20,000 square meters) as experiments, and organized strong work groups to go deep into the key areas, cultivate typical examples, create experience, and guide the overall work. In this way, the Municipal Committee not only grasped the main links in basic construction, understood the situation, and discovered problems, but also enabled a large number of cadres participating in basic construction to quickly learn some professional knowledge.

    Third, strengthen inspection work and establish inspection work as a system. Emphasize the need to oppose bureaucracy in basic construction, and use the case of Ren Sun, the director of the flax factory, as an example of bureaucracy to educate cadres, and sharply criticize the bureaucratic phenomena in basic construction work at that time. In addition, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee also organized a city-wide large-scale broadcast and held lectures on political common sense. Under the leadership of the Party, the Construction Trade Union organized technical performances, implemented a large-scale technical training exercise, and conducted ideological education on new design standards for technical personnel.

    Since the Municipal Committee paid attention to unified leadership from the beginning, clarified the focus of work on construction sites, and resolutely and quickly made full preparations ideologically and organizationally, this effectively strengthened the Party's leadership and supervision over basic construction.

    **Grasp the Party's Policies and Lead the Responsibility System Movement**

    In mid-June, the Basic Construction Committee of the Municipal Committee conducted its first work inspection and found that the phenomena of no one being responsible and irresponsibility were prevalent and serious on the construction sites. For example, work stoppages due to waiting for materials during construction, chaotic labor organization, no one implementing operating procedures, poor project quality, and very poor living conditions for workers, while management personnel were indifferent. This situation not only seriously affected the progress of various tasks, but also directly and indirectly caused great losses to the country. For example, on the construction site of the Higher Vocational School of Engineering, more than 200 million yuan was wasted on transportation costs due to the wrong placement of materials, and other tangible and intangible losses in other places were even more difficult to calculate. In order to eliminate the phenomena of no one being responsible and irresponsibility, the Municipal Committee concentrated its efforts to launch a responsibility system movement to solve this key problem.

    This movement was roughly divided into two steps. The first was to improve the quality awareness of employees and the masses, mobilize the masses to expose the phenomena of no one being responsible and poor project quality from the bottom up, and carry out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom. Then, according to the specific situation, improve the construction site organization and establish and improve the responsibility system.

    At the beginning of the movement, some cadres believed that solving the chaotic situation on the construction site only required supplementing the system. They thought that the existence of irresponsibility was only a matter of system. In fact, many systems had already been formulated. There were as many as twenty articles on the construction worker system alone, but no one followed it. Some cadres worried that if mass criticism was launched and some technical personnel could not accept it and became passive, how could the building be built? This idea of ​​unprincipled accommodation was criticized and corrected by the Municipal Committee at that time. After criticizing the idea of ​​unprincipled accommodation, some units then simply launched workers to expose and struggle, while ignoring the ideological education of technical personnel and management personnel. The Municipal Committee criticized and corrected this again. The Engineering Department of the First Engineering Company of the former Northeast People's Government Industrial Department, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Committee, specifically held a meeting of technical personnel to explain the policies to them, dispel their concerns, and mobilize them to actively participate in the responsibility system movement. A technical person on the Third Construction Site had been working in private construction factories for a long time in the past. He thought that he could eat anywhere with his skills. He sat in the office all day and did not go to the site. He did not care about the phenomena of work stoppage and rework on the construction site. After the workers' exposure, criticism, and repeated education from the leadership, he recognized and corrected his mistakes, went deep into the site, relied on the workers, solved the problem of five quotas, and overcame the phenomena of work stoppage and rework of the rebar workers, so that the project that used to require 83 people to complete in three and a half days was reduced to 57 people in two days. This fact shows that if there is only the workers' exposure and struggle against mistakes, and technical personnel and management personnel do not participate in the movement, then the work on the construction site cannot be improved.

    The second step of the movement: According to the problems exposed, quickly solve them from the organizational leadership level. For example, add special personnel to be responsible for solving employee welfare problems, deploy cadres with strong political and professional skills to serve as construction site directors, remove elements who resist the movement and are irresponsible, establish various organizations such as construction site finance, materials, wages, and security, implement the construction site responsibility system, and change the past large-scale continuous operation method with the engineering department as the grassroots unit. After the workers went through the responsibility system movement, they saw that their opinions were adopted, and that the work style of management personnel and technical personnel had changed, which further strengthened their sense of responsibility as masters of the country. The workers of the Songjiang Harbin Sugar Factory were afraid of honeycombs and dog holes when they were doing concrete work before the box boards were opened, so they couldn't sleep. They said: "Looking forward to opening the box boards is more anxious than looking forward to getting paid!"

    In carrying out the responsibility system movement, the Municipal Committee deeply realized that the responsibility system is not only a basic principle in production management, but also a basic principle in construction management. Because the development of the responsibility system movement not only gives a head-on blow to bureaucrats and blindly complacent people, but also gives the broad masses of employees the most practical political education. When the mass responsibility system movement is launched vigorously, it is necessary to firmly grasp the Party's policy of relying on the working masses, striving for education, uniting and transforming technical personnel and management personnel. It is necessary to oppose unprincipled accommodation, and to prevent simple and hasty actions. The demands put forward by the working masses should be resolved as much as possible, and the tendency of extreme democratization should be prevented. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the workers be greatly brought into play and the healthy development of the movement be guaranteed.

    **Implement the Mass Line and Promote Parallel Flow Operation Method**

    On the basis of strengthening the responsibility system, the Municipal Committee decided to vigorously promote Wang Sunci's segmented parallel flow operation method, strengthen the organization and planning of construction management, in order to accelerate the progress of the project.

    At that time, the advanced experience in various types of operations had been relatively widely promoted, but the old and backward handicraft-style construction management methods hindered and restricted the further promotion of various advanced experiences. Therefore, vigorously promoting Wang Sunci's segmented parallel flow operation method is an important method to fully exert the labor efficiency of various types of work. The construction site of the Higher Vocational School of Engineering was initially worried that it would not be able to complete the task, but due to the adoption of the parallel flow operation method, it was completed 25 days ahead of schedule. The seven-story building of the Industrial University had to be completed over the years in the past, but last year it started on May 23 and was basically completed in early October.

    The promotion of the parallel flow operation method not only requires various sound responsibility systems, but also requires scientific organization of construction, so that various types of work are well combined and production is carried out rhythmically. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to formulate advanced and practical construction plans. Therefore, the accurate formulation and implementation of the construction plan is a central key to implementing the parallel flow operation method.

    The main experiences of the Party organizations of various construction sites in Harbin in ensuring and supervising the implementation of construction plans and ensuring the implementation of the parallel flow operation method are:

    (1) It is necessary to strengthen the education of workers and the masses on the concept of planning and overall thinking, and repeatedly explain to technical personnel and staff the superiority of the new construction method, pointing out that whether the plan of a group or a type of work can be completed will directly affect the completion of the entire construction plan. When imbalances occur in the progress of the project, the Party organization on the scene should resolutely encourage those advanced groups to lead the backward groups to catch up quickly. For example, the Third Construction Site plans to change the past four-section work into two-section work in order to fully exert the labor productivity of the bricklayers; but at the same time, it is necessary to solve the construction problems of the wood, tile, and rebar workers, otherwise, the concrete will not have a curing period. The Party organization studied this situation and mobilized the masses to solve the problem of simultaneous construction of tile workers and rebar workers, so that the construction period was shortened from the past 12 days to 10 days to 9 days.

    (2) The Party must establish the concept of "quality first" among all employees, and repeatedly explain to the workers that basic construction is a major national undertaking for centuries to come, and defective products are absolutely not allowed. Therefore, it is necessary to organize workers to systematically study quality standards and operating procedures, overcome the thinking of some workers that "buildings can be built without operating procedures," and regularly organize mass quality inspections, and through quality inspections, launch mass criticism and self-criticism to correct the phenomenon of simply rushing progress and ignoring quality.

    (3) It is necessary to educate technical personnel and management personnel to follow the mass line, and hand over the construction plan to the broad masses for discussion. When formulating the plan, it is necessary to mobilize technical personnel and staff to go deep into the worker sheds to explain the plan to the workers, listen to the workers' rationalization proposals, and make necessary revisions and supplements to the plan. Because only by handing over the plan to the masses for discussion can the plan be made practical and can the plan become a huge force to mobilize the masses and accelerate the progress of the project. Secondly, due to the adoption of the parallel flow operation method, after each type of work has been planned, they are all eager to sign a contact contract between each type of work in order to ensure the balanced completion of the original plan. Otherwise, the completion of their own plan may be affected due to the delay of other types of work. Therefore, it is very necessary for the Party organization to lead the workers to formulate contact contracts in a timely manner.

    Experience has proved that the promotion of advanced experience in improving labor organization and operation methods must be combined with the promotion of advanced experience in improving construction management. Due to the promotion of the advanced experience of the parallel flow operation method and the signing of contact contracts, the progress of the project has been accelerated by one-half, and the collective concept of workers, management personnel, and technical personnel has been enhanced in actual work. It has created conditions for the gradual mechanization and factoryization of construction enterprises in the future.

    **Educate Cadres to Care about Employee Welfare Facilities**

    The issue of employee welfare and security facilities in basic construction is a major issue related to "relying on the working class" to do a good job in production. In order to improve the workers' living welfare and security facilities, the Harbin Municipal Committee organized six major inspections. At the beginning of construction, the focus was on checking the workers' accommodation, eating, and drinking water. In summer, the environmental sanitation and wage implementation were checked. In autumn, the focus was on checking the security issues during high-altitude operations. In winter, special inspections were carried out on air defense, warmth preservation, fire prevention, and other aspects. Before and after each inspection, a cadre meeting above the construction site was held, requiring construction site cadres to treat labor protection and welfare issues in basic construction from the perspective and position of the working class, and severely criticize various erroneous views that ignore workers' welfare work. At the same time, various specific issues in the workers' lives were resolved separately. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, a total of 28 medical clinics, 33 barbershops, 30 cooperatives and service stations, 12 bathhouses, 28 shoe repair shops, and 3 post offices were established, and 13,000 workers enjoyed labor protection benefits.

    Because the leadership cared about the workers' lives in every way, the workers deeply felt the warmth of the new national life, which greatly improved their sense of being masters of the country and their enthusiasm for patriotism. Therefore, although the construction area last year increased by 56% compared with the previous year, the number of workers only increased by 20%, and finally the huge task of more than 600,000 square meters was successfully completed.

    The employee welfare work in Harbin has been done relatively well, mainly because the leadership has focused on solving the following two problems:

    The first is to educate cadres (especially management cadres) to attach importance to workers' welfare facilities ideologically, and care about workers' eating, drinking, living, and other things. For example, workers' sending letters and repairing shoes seem to be trivial matters, but for workers who work hard every day, they have become quite important things, because if these "small things" are not solved, the workers will inevitably ask for leave for these "small things," which will affect wage income and construction progress.

    Secondly, establish specialized agencies and equip full-time cadres to be responsible for workers' food, accommodation, security, and other work; at the same time, mobilize the masses to work together to do a good job in labor protection and welfare work, and abide by operating procedures. For example, some workers were carrying bricks on dangerous roads, and some young workers were dancing on high-altitude scaffolding, which could not avoid dangers. The construction site under the Third Engineering Zone of the Electric Power Bureau established a security inspection team among the workers, and held a cadre meeting above the group leader every week to conduct security education, which was very effective.

    In order to ensure safe operation in 1953, the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Committee plans to establish security teams on large construction sites above 10,000 square meters, and solve the problem of specialized leadership agencies.

    **Pay Attention to Leading Regular Propaganda and Mobilization Work**

    The smooth completion of the basic construction project task in Harbin in 1952 was inseparable from the strong cooperation of the Party's propaganda and mobilization work. During the strengthening of the responsibility system movement, class education was carried out around this movement to explain the harm of no one being responsible and irresponsibility. Then, the red flag competition was widely launched, so that 92% of the construction workers in the city participated in the competition movement, consolidating the results of the responsibility system. When promoting advanced experience, the importance of advanced experience in accelerating the progress of the project was publicized, so that several advanced experiences with decisive significance were relatively widely promoted. 97.7% of carpenters adopted the carpenter flow operation method, and 95.5% of workers adopted the advanced plastering method. Due to the development of cultural and propaganda work, not only was the promotion of advanced experience effectively guaranteed, but also the cultural life of workers was further improved. According to the statistics of four construction sites in three months, the workers created better works (such as singing, drama, crosstalk) totaling 55 pieces in response to the problems and ideological situation at each stage, and officially performed 62 performances. The Industrial University construction site also organized its own band.

    Over the past year, Harbin has had the following experiences in cultural propaganda and mobilization work:

    1. It is necessary to be good at actively organizing propaganda forces to serve basic construction. The CCP Harbin Municipal Committee has adopted two methods to organize a huge propaganda force: one is to organize construction site cultural service teams to "deliver to the door," show slides and movies, organize story evenings, hold roving exhibitions, and even send various books, newspapers, magazines, etc. directly to workers' dormitories and kang heads. This propaganda team included all propaganda departments in the city, such as the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Cultural Troupe, the Cultural Palace, the Film Team, the Quyi Improvement Association, and the mass propaganda teams of cultural centers in various districts, universities, middle schools, and primary schools, totaling more than 1,400 people. As soon as they arrived at the construction site, the workers affectionately called out, "Our service team is here." The other method is to "reclaim wasteland on the spot," pay attention to cultivating the strength of the construction site itself, and establish workers' own cultural propaganda organizations, such as organizing reading groups, radio stations, etc., to carry out activities under the unified leadership of the Party. The Industrial University construction site originally only had two cultural and educational cadres, but under the specific training of the Party, more than 50 activists appeared, and now 14 propagandists serve as cultural and educational cadres for the construction site and workshops. Facts have proved that as long as there is a determination to organize propaganda forces, although the original propaganda foundation of the construction site is weak, the potential strength is huge.

    2. It is necessary to grasp the characteristics of the construction site and workers, and flexibly use a variety of propaganda forms. For example, adapt to the characteristics of the construction site being scattered and the workers' labor being relatively tense, and use tools and forms such as broadcasting, mobile slogans, mobile cartoons, blackboard newspapers, and greeting boards to carry out propaganda on the scene, on the road that must be taken to and from work, in the dining hall, and in the dormitory; for example, take care of the workers' low cultural level, and use more examples and physical objects for propaganda, such as slides, picture exhibitions, etc. Also, adapt to the characteristics of workers coming from rural areas, and pay attention to local-style performances, such as quyi, storytelling, and bungg-bungg opera. Other short and powerful forms such as kuaiban, crosstalk, and short dramas can also be used more. In short, due to the various characteristics of the construction site, propaganda work must be very timely, specific, and effective, so that construction site propaganda has a strong combat capability.

    3. The Party organization of the construction site must strengthen the specific leadership of cultural propaganda work, so that cultural propaganda activities always stand in front of the movement. The Party organizations of the Industrial University and the Racecourse and other construction sites have specifically led cultural propaganda workers to study basic construction documents and instructions from higher authorities, put forward work requirements for them at various periods, review their propaganda plans, and help them solve specific problems in their work. This has effectively brought into play the propaganda forces.

        ×××

    Over the past year, due to the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee's adherence to the policy of placing basic construction in the primary position, and on the premise of ensuring quality, the construction project tasks of 1952 were basically completed. This achievement is huge. However, according to the Municipal Committee's inspection, there are still shortcomings in the leadership work. This is reflected in the fact that more attention is paid to civil and structural construction, less attention is paid to design work, and installation work is not managed at all. In terms of the deployment of cadre work, in general, the quality of cadres working in basic construction departments is still weaker than that of production departments. How to achieve overall planning and take all aspects into consideration is what needs attention in future work.

### 中共哈尔滨市委领导基本建设的经验

    中共哈尔滨市委领导基本建设的经验
    编者按：中共哈尔滨市委领导基本建设的经验，基本上是成功的。哈尔滨市委不仅坚决迅速地健全了领导机构，统一了领导思想，而且及时地解决了基本建设工作过程中的关键性的问题，注意了经常性的政治宣传工作，这就具体而实际地贯彻了“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，保证了国家计划的完成。目前，许多党委还缺乏这样的经验，因此，吸取中共哈尔滨市委的经验，以改进对基本建设的领导工作，是非常必要的。
    充实领导机构，统一领导思想
    一九五二年底，中共哈尔滨市委集结了百余干部，以两个半月的时间，自下而上地总结了一年来的基本建设工作经验。
    哈尔滨市一九五二年的基本建设任务共六十九万八千平方公尺。任务很大，施工却很晚。五月，施工季节已到，而绝大多数工程尚未开工。哈尔滨市委无专门作基本建设的工作干部，不少干部对基本建设是国家的百年大计没有明确的认识，有的单位不愿调干部、尤其不愿调好的干部到基本建设部门工作。这些情况严重地影响了基本建设的进行。因此，哈尔滨市委乃集中力量迅速解决下列几个问题：
    第一、充实领导机构，统一领导思想。首先，建立与加强市的基本建设委员会，由党、行政、工会、青年团的负责同志参加，以便统一工作步调；同时，市委工业部设立基本建设工作处，专做基本建设中的党的工作，市委宣传部设立了基本建设工作组，统一领导全市工地工人的宣传教育工作。为了有效地保证工程任务的完成，市委明确确定党、行政、工会、青年团各系统均以工地工作为重点，工作干部的大部力量放在工地，并在工地上建立基层组织，所有工作布置和检查，均在统一的计划和领导下共同进行。这样，不仅避免了党、行政、工会、青年团相互抵消力量的毛病，而且充分发挥了党的统一领导，经常地及时地解决工作中一切重要问题。
    第二、市委确定以哈尔滨工业大学（二万多平方公尺的七层大楼）等几个重要工地作试验，并组织强有力的工作组，重点深入，培养典型，创造经验，指导全面。这样，市委不仅抓住了基本建设中的主要环节，了解情况，发现问题，而且使大批参加基本建设的工作干部迅速地学会了一些业务知识。
    第三、加强检查工作，把检查工作定为制度。强调提出反对基本建设中的官僚主义，并以亚麻厂厂长任荪的官僚主义事例，在干部中进行教育，尖锐地批判了当时基本建设工作中的官僚主义现象。此外市委宣传部又组织了全市性的大广播，举办了政治常识讲座。建筑工会在党的领导下组织了技术表演，实行技术大练兵，并对技术人员进行了关于新设计标准的思想教育。
    由于市委一开始就注意了统一领导，明确了以工地为工作重点，并坚决迅速地从思想上、组织上作了充分准备，这就有效地加强了党对基本建设的领导和监督作用。
    掌握党的政策，领导责任制运动
    六月中旬，市基本建设委员会作了第一次工作检查，发现工地上普遍严重地存在着无人负责和不负责任的现象。如施工上的停工待料，劳动组织混乱，操作规程无人执行，工程质量低劣，工人生活条件很坏，而管理人员漠不关心等，这种种情况不但严重地影响了各种工作的进行，并直接间接地给国家造成了很大的损失。如工科高职工地因材料位置放错，浪费搬运费二亿多元，其他各地有形无形的损失更难计算。为了消灭无人负责和不负责任的现象，市委乃集中力量开展责任制运动，解决这一关键性的问题。
    这个运动大体分两个步骤，首先是提高职工群众的质量观念，发动群众自下而上的揭发无人负责及工程质量低劣的现象，开展自上而下的批评与自我批评；然后根据具体情况，改善工地组织，建立与健全责任制度。
    运动开始，有些干部认为解决工地混乱状况，只要补充一下制度就可以了。他们以为不负责任的现象所以存在，仅仅是一个制度问题。事实上制度已制订了很多，单施工员制度就有二十来条，可是没人按照它办。有的干部顾虑群众性的批评展开后，万一有些技术人员接受不了，消极怠工，大楼盖不起来怎么办。这种无原则的迁就的思想，当时就受到了市委的批判和纠正。在批判了无原则迁就的思想后接着某些单位又发生了单纯的发动工人进行揭发和斗争，而忽视了对技术人员、管理人员的思想教育工作，市委对此又进行了批判和纠正。前东北人民政府工业部第一工程公司的工程处又按市委指示专门召开技术人员会议，向他们交代政策，打消顾虑，发动他们积极地参加责任制运动。第三工地有个技术人员，过去长期在私人营造厂做事。他以为自己有了技术到处可以吃饭，整天坐在办公室不下现场，工地上发生了窝工、返工现象也不过问。经过工人们的揭发、批评和领导方面的反复教育，他认识与改正了错误，深入现场，依靠工人，解决了五种定额问题，克服了铁筋工的窝工返工现象，使过去需要八十三人三天半时间才能完成的工程缩减到五十七人两天便完成了。这个事实说明了如果单有工人对错误的揭发斗争，而没有技术人员管理人员投入运动，那末工地工作是不可能获得改进的。
    运动的第二步骤：根据暴露出来的问题，迅速地从组织领导上予以解决。例如增设专人，负责解决职工福利问题，调配政治、业务较强的干部担任工地主任，撤换抗拒运动、不负责任的分子，建立工地财务、材料、工资、保安等各种组织，实行工地负责制，改变过去以工程处为基层单位的大流水作业法。工人们经过责任制运动后，看到自己的意见被采纳了，看到管理人员和技术人员的作风转变了，更加加强了国家主人翁的责任感。松江哈尔滨制糖厂工人在打混凝土工程未揭开盒子板之前，他们怕出蜂窝狗洞，就睡不着觉，他们说：盼揭盒子板比盼发工资还着急！
    在开展责任制的运动中，市委深深体验到：责任制不仅是生产管理上的基本原则，同样也是施工管理上的基本原则。因为责任制运动的开展，不仅给官僚主义、盲目自满的人一个当头棒，而且给广大职工群众一次最实际的政治教育。在群众性的责任制运动猛烈展开时，必须紧紧掌握党的依靠工人群众、争取教育、团结改造技术人员和管理人员的政策。既要反对无原则的迁就，又要防止简单急躁。对工人群众所提出的要求，既要尽可能的予以解决，又要防止极端民主化的偏向发生。只有如此，才能大大地发挥工人的积极性，保证运动的健康发展。
    贯彻群众路线，推广平行流水作业法
    在加强责任制的基础上，市委决定大力推广王荪慈的分段平行流水作业法，加强施工管理的组织性、计划性，以加速工程进度。
    当时，各工种操作上的先进经验已经比较普遍地推广，但是由于旧的落后的手工业式的施工管理方法阻碍和束缚了各种先进经验进一步的推广，因此，大力推广王荪慈的分段平行流水作业法，正是充分发挥各工种劳动效率的重要方法。工科高职工地开始担心不能完成任务，由于采用了平行流水作业法，结果提前二十五天便完成了。工业大学的七层大楼在过去必须跨年才能完工，而去年从五月二十三日开工，十月初即基本上完工。
    平行流水作业法的推广，不仅要有各种健全的责任制，而且要求有科学的组织施工，使各工种很好地结合起来，进行有节奏的生产。为了做到这一点，必须制订先进的切实可行的施工计划。因此，准确的施工计划的制订与贯彻，是贯彻平行流水作业法的一个中心关键。
    哈尔滨市各工地党的组织在保证与监督施工计划的实施、保证实行平行流水作业法中的主要经验是：
    （一）要加强对工人群众进行计划观念和整体思想的教育，反复的向技术人员、职员说明新的施工方法的优越性，指出一个小组一个工种的计划能否完成，会直接影响到整个施工计划的完成。当工程进度发生不平衡现象时，现场的党组织则应坚决地鼓励那些先进的小组带动落后的小组迅速赶上。如第三工地打算将过去的四段工改成二段工，以充分地发挥瓦工的劳动生产率；但同时必须解决木瓦铁筋工的施工问题，否则，混凝土便没有保养期。党组织研究了这种情况，发动群众解决了瓦工和铁筋工同时施工问题，使工期由过去的十二天缩短到十天到九天。
    （二）党要在全体职工中树立“质量第一”的观念，反复向工人说明：基本建设是国家的百年大计，绝对不许出废品。因此必须组织工人系统地学习质量标准和操作规程，克服某些工人“没有操作规程也能盖大楼”的思想，并经常组织群众性的质量检查，通过质量检查，展开群众性的批评与自我批评，纠正那种单纯赶进度而忽视质量的现象。
    （三）必须教育技术人员、管理人员走群众路线，将施工计划交给广大群众讨论。在制订计划时，要动员技术人员、职员深入工棚向工人交代计划，听取工人的合理化建议，对计划作必要的修改和补充。因为只有将计划交给群众讨论，才能使计划订得切合实际，才能使计划成为动员群众的巨大力量，并加速了工程进度。其次，由于平行流水作业法的采用，各工种在订好计划后，都迫切要求订立每个工种之间的联系合同，以保证均衡地完成原定计划。否则，可能由于别的工种拖延时日而影响到自己计划的完成。因此党组织适时地领导工人制订联系合同是十分必要的。
    经验证明，推广改善劳动组织与操作方法的先进经验，必须与推广改进施工管理的先进经验相结合。由于平行流水作业法的先进经验的推广，联系合同的订立，使工程进度加快了二分之一，使工人群众、管理人员、技术人员在实际工作中增强了集体观念。为今后建筑企业逐渐机械化、工厂化创造了条件。
    教育干部关心职工福利设施
    基本建设中的职工福利和保安设施问题，是关系着“依靠工人阶级”搞好生产的重大问题。为了改善工人的生活福利与保安设施，哈尔滨市委曾组织了六次大检查。在施工开始，着重检查了工人的住宿、吃饭、喝水等问题。夏季，检查了环境卫生和工资执行情况。秋季，着重检查了高空作业时期的保安问题。冬季，专门进行了防空、保暖、防火等方面的检查。每次检查前后，都召开工地以上的干部会议，要求工地干部要以工人阶级的观点、立场来对待基本建设中的劳动保护福利问题，严厉批判各种忽视工人福利工作的错误观点。同时，对工人生活上的各种具体问题分别予以解决。据不完全统计：一年来，共建立了二十八个医疗所，三十三个理发室，三十个合作社及服务站，十二个澡塘子，二十八个掌鞋处，三个邮亭，有一万三千个工人享受了劳动保护待遇。
    由于领导方面处处关心工人生活，工人们就深深感受到新国家生活的温暖，从而大大提高了主人翁的感觉与爱国主义的热情。所以去年工程面积虽然比前年增加百分之五十六，而工人只增加了百分之二十，终于胜利地完成了六十余万平方公尺的巨大任务。
    哈尔滨市的职工福利工作所以做得较好，主要是由于领导方面着重注意解决了以下两个问题：
    首先是教育干部（特别是管理工作干部）从思想上重视工人的福利设施，关心工人吃、喝、住等事情。例如工人的寄信、掌鞋等事情，看起来似乎是微不足道的小事，可是对每天紧张工作的工人来说，却成了相当重要的事情，因为这些“小事”不解决，工人们就难免为了这些“小事”而请假，这就要影响工资收入和施工进行。
    其次，建立专门机构，配备专职干部负责工人的食宿、保安等工作；同时发动群众，大家动手来搞好劳动保护福利工作，遵守操作规程。如有的工人在危险的马路上挑砖，有的青年工人在高空架子上跳舞，都不免发生危险。电工局三工区所属工地在工人中建立保安检查组，每周开一次小组长以上的干部会进行保安教育，收效很大。
    为使一九五三年作到安全作业，哈尔滨市基本建设委员会拟在一万公尺以上的大工地都成立保安组，并解决专门领导机构问题。
    注意领导经常性的宣传鼓动工作
    哈尔滨市一九五二年基本建设工程任务能够顺利完成，是和党的宣传鼓动工作有力配合分不开的。在加强责任制运动时，即围绕着这一运动进行阶级教育，解释无人负责与不负责任的危害。接着，广泛地发动了红旗竞赛，使全市百分之九十二的建筑工人参加了竞赛运动，巩固了责任制的成果。在推广先进经验时，即宣传先进经验对加速工程进度的重要意义，使几种带有决定意义的先进经验得到相当普遍的推广，有百分之九十七点七的木工采用木工流水作业法，百分之九十五点五的工人采用了先进抹灰法。由于文化宣传工作的开展，不仅先进经验的推广得到有力的保证，同时工人文化生活也得到进一步的提高。据四个工地三个月的统计，工人们针对各个阶段的问题和思想情况，创作了较好的作品（如演唱、戏剧、相声）共五十五件，正式演出六十二场，工业大学工地还组织了自己的乐队。
    一年来，哈尔滨市在文化宣传鼓动工作方面有如下的几点体会：
    一、要善于主动地组织宣传力量为基本建设服务。中共哈尔滨市委曾采用两种办法组织了庞大的宣传力量：一是组织工地文化服务队“送上门去”，放映幻灯、电影、组织故事晚会，举办巡回展览，甚至把各种书报、杂志等直接送到工人宿舍和炕头去。参加这一个宣传大队的包括全市各宣传部门，如市委宣传部、市总工会文教部、文联、文工团、文化宫、电影队、曲艺改进会、以及各区文化馆群众宣传队、大学、中学、小学校共计一千四百余人，他们一到工地，工人们亲切地叫唤“咱们的服务队来了”。另一种办法就是“就地开荒”，注意培植工地本身力量，建立工人自己的文化宣传组织，如组织读报组、广播站等，在党的统一领导下进行活动。工业大学工地原来只有两个文教干部，在党的具体培养下，出现了五十多个积极分子，现在有十四名宣传员担任了工地和车间的文教干部。事实证明，只要决心组织宣传力量，工地原有的宣传基础虽然薄弱，而潜在的力量却是巨大的。
    二、必须掌握工地与工人的特点，灵活使用多种多样的宣传形式。如适应工地分散和工人劳动比较紧张的特点，在现场、在上下班必经的道上、在饭厅、宿舍，应用广播、流动标语、流动漫画、黑板报、问好板等工具和形式进行宣传；如照顾工人文化水平低的情况，则多多应用实例、实物的宣传，如幻灯、图片展览等等。又如适应工人来自农村的特点，则注意地方色彩的演唱，如曲艺、说唱、嘣嘣戏等。其他还可多多采用快板、相声、短剧等短小有力的形式。总之，由于工地各方面的特点，要求宣传工作必须十分及时，具体，有效，使工地宣传具有强烈的战斗性。
    三、工地党的组织要加强对文化宣传工作的具体领导，使文化宣传活动永远站在运动的前面。工业大学和赛马场等工地的党组织曾具体领导文化宣传工作人员学习基本建设的文件和上级指示，向他们提出各个时期的工作要求，审查他们的宣传计划，并帮助他们解决工作中的具体问题。这就有效地发挥了宣传力量。

    一年来，由于中共哈尔滨市委坚持了把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，在保证质量的前提下，基本上完成了一九五二年的建设工程任务。这个成绩是巨大的。但据市委检查，领导工作还有不够的地方，这表现在对土木建筑施工方面管得多，对设计工作管得少，安装工作则根本没有管。在调配干部工作方面，一般说，基本建设部门工作干部质量和生产部门比起来还弱。如何做到统筹兼顾，这是今后工作中所需要注意的。（本文根据哈尔滨市基本建设委员会关于基本建设各项工作总结编写）
