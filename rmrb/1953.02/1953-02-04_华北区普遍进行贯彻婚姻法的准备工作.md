Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd—Preparatory work for the movement to implement the Marriage Law is being carried out universally in various parts of North China. Following the establishment of the North China Region Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, organizations leading the Marriage Law implementation movement in various provinces and cities have also been established. Tianjin Municipality has also organized two specialized committees responsible for inspection and propaganda work. Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces have also specially organized propaganda committees. In order to mobilize the broad masses of the people to engage in this social reform movement, the Hebei Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee has issued a call to the people of the province to further implement the Marriage Law. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a resolution to launch a movement to implement the Marriage Law.

From the beginning of January, various parts of the region began focusing on pilot projects and investigations to understand the situation for implementing the Marriage Law movement. The North China Region Marriage Law Investigation and Pilot Work Team conducted trials and investigations in key villages in Shanxi and Hebei and key streets in Tianjin Municipality, which are about to conclude. Hebei Province is summarizing the experience of its typical pilot work. The investigation and pilot work in Beijing, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces is still continuing. Through this period of work, various places have gained a more concrete understanding of the extent to which the Marriage Law has been implemented in the past and have gained initial experience in mobilizing the masses to implement the Marriage Law.

Some cities and counties have paid attention to training cadres and activists in preparation, in order to cultivate the backbone of the movement. Suiyuan Province held a training class for women cadres, and all 105 trainees will participate in the work of implementing the Marriage Law. The first batch of more than 100 trainees from the training class for civil affairs committee members, women cadres, and activists held by the Taiyuan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation in Shanxi Province has completed training, and the second batch has begun.

Preparatory work for publicizing the Marriage Law is also being vigorously carried out in various places. Propaganda departments in various provinces and cities have formulated plans for compiling and printing propaganda materials. Tianjin Municipality organized the literary and art circles to participate in the key pilot work of implementing the Marriage Law and mobilized them to carry out literary and artistic creation. Folk artists throughout Suiyuan Province have gone to places such as the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League to cooperate with inspection teams in doing pilot work; the province's paper-cutting training class is creating various paper-cutting samples related to propaganda on the Marriage Law, preparing to send them to various places before the Spring Festival. Shanxi Province will compile and distribute 800,000 copies of various propaganda pamphlets in February. Shuoxian County has also organized a propaganda team to implement the Marriage Law, and is rehearsing street dramas, rhythmic storytelling and other programs in preparation for performances. Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, held a Marriage Law publicity conference, formulated propaganda materials, and decided to train 500 members of rural theater troupes in preparation for publicizing the Marriage Law.
