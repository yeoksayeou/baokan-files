    Cadre Cultural Learning in Organizations Directly Under the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Dong Su, Director of the Theoretical Education Department of the Propaganda Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    I. The Cultural Learning Position is Developing Day by Day
    The Cultural Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee's Amateur Party School for organizations directly under it has been around for over three years since its establishment in 1950. At the beginning, due to a lack of experience, the students did not personally experience the benefits of cultural learning, so their enthusiasm was not high and attendance was poor. Over the past three years, through the unremitting efforts of the leadership and all teachers and students, and overcoming various difficulties, cultural learning entered a new stage from the beginning of 1951, and a high tide of cultural learning appeared. There are now 1,856 students, 12 full-time teachers, and 17 part-time teachers. From literacy classes for illiterates to high school classes, there are a total of 28 classes. Subjects studied: elementary and senior elementary schools both study Chinese and arithmetic. Junior high schools study Chinese, arithmetic, history, and political common sense. Senior high school is a Chinese language major (this year, it is planned to divide the senior high school class into liberal arts and science. The liberal arts is to continue to improve the Chinese language level of cadres, and the science is to meet the needs of economic construction and improve the professional and technical level of cadres in enterprise departments). The length of schooling is: literacy class for illiterates, graduation in three months, recognizing 2,000 characters. Elementary school graduates in two years. Senior elementary school graduates in one year. Junior high school graduates in two years. Senior high school Chinese language majors graduate in one year. In this way, from illiterate to high school graduation, it only takes six years and three months, which greatly reduces the learning process and has a very rapid nature.
    Those who participate in cultural learning include not only section chiefs, staff members, and odd-job personnel, but also 66 bureau and department-level cadres. There are not only young comrades, but also old comrades over the age of 50. Because learning has indeed improved their cultural level and work ability, their learning enthusiasm is full. Every day after dinner, there are bustling crowds carrying books to school; female comrades quickly finish feeding their children and leave, disabled soldiers come earlier with crutches, and some come from ten miles away to study. Sometimes the power goes out, everyone brings their own candles and insists on studying by candlelight. Learning has become an indispensable part of everyone's life. Comrades who did not participate in the test because they went to the countryside return to school to request a make-up exam, or send their homework back to school for teachers to correct. Everyone feels that the school is a good place to cultivate themselves, and they all warmly love and care for it. Whenever there are commemorative festivals, they write letters to the school and send souvenirs. Comrades who have graduated from the school also deeply miss it.
    II. The Gains of Cultural Learning Over the Past Three Years
    Over the past three years, 480 people have graduated from illiterate to elementary school level. 750 people have graduated from the first year of elementary school to senior elementary school level. 750 people have graduated from the first year of senior elementary school to junior high school level. A total of 780 people have graduated from junior high school. In 1953, 220 people will graduate from senior high school with a Chinese language major. Many comrades have improved their work by improving their culture, and have been promoted from staff members to section leaders and section chiefs. Many comrades have changed from doing odd jobs or storage work to doing dispatch, accounting, and clerical work. Cooks and nannies have also become typists and accountants. A revolutionary disabled soldier comrade, who was originally illiterate and lost his right hand in combat, can now write neat notes and news articles with his left hand, and can also do preliminary and final accounts. Comrade Shao Yunfang of the Provincial Court, who used to be an illiterate old lady in her fifties, has now learned to keep accounts, do arithmetic, read the Northeast Daily, and has also become the study committee member of the branch of the organization. Due to the improvement of cultural level, everyone has also improved their ability to analyze and summarize problems, and learned to synthesize and organize materials. Comrades who do archival work and manage materials said: "The classification cards are more organized and more detailed." Comrades working in enterprise departments have learned to measure cubic meters, calculate area capacity, and price indices. Accounting comrades have shortened the time for sorting vouchers and accounts due to the improvement of their arithmetic level. The administrator and clerk have learned to manage accounts well and are not confused. A comrade who manages oil drums in the warehouse of the Finance Department said: "In the past, I could never figure out how many oil drums held how much oil, and I had to find people everywhere to help, which often delayed work and made me feel very upset. Now, I have learned division and can quickly calculate the number of barrels, and the efficiency of my work has improved." After studying history, the knowledge of historical facts has been enriched, laying a good foundation for the study of political common sense. The sentiment of "being a roughneck and not being able to get along" among many worker and peasant cadres has been replaced by enthusiasm and confidence in learning. Many cadres with low cultural levels have participated in theoretical study due to the improvement of their cultural levels.
    III. Teaching Methods and Several Major Experiences
    The fundamental purpose of cultural learning is to improve students' cultural level, improve work efficiency, and lay a good foundation for political theory learning. The characteristics of comrades participating in cultural learning are: rich experience in struggle and life, strong understanding, little book knowledge, and unaccustomed to systematic mental activity. In order to achieve the learning objectives and adapt to the above characteristics, the general teaching methods are: inspiring thinking, focusing on depth, linking with reality, and repeated practice, and these links must be closely integrated.
    Inspire thinking: In lectures and assignments, in addition to teachers giving vivid explanations, they must combine with the text to guide students to use their brains to think, express their own views, and展开讨论, and then the teachers will conduct critical summaries. The advantage of doing this is that it can understand the students' progress, inspire students to use their brains to think, and improve their interest in studying problems. Such inspirational discussions do not take up too much time and do not affect the policy of focusing on lectures.
    Focus on depth: Because students are learning in their spare time, their energy and time are limited, and the content of lectures must be concise and centered. In a certain period of time, the students' ears, eyes, and brains should be concentrated on a central issue. Only in this way can the greatest effect be achieved. For example, when explaining the construction of simple sentences, whether in lectures, reviews, or assignment corrections, teachers will repeatedly explain around this issue. For example, in a certain period of time, grasp the commonly made misspelled words, repeatedly explain, and concentrate efforts to eliminate them. In addition, students should be allowed to practice repeatedly.
    Connect with reality: (1) The connection between the content of textbooks and the current political reality: In addition to teaching fixed textbooks, often select some fresh domestic and foreign events, magazines, and major articles in newspapers as supplementary materials. Such as:
    During the "Three-Anti" movement, the "Communist Party Member Zhang Ziliang, who has always maintained a hard-working and simple style" was widely studied in senior elementary and junior high school classes, and "Glory to the Great Mao Zedong" was discussed in connection with the third National Day. (2) The connection between teaching methods and students' practical experience. That is, when lecturing, it is necessary to explain and explain in connection with the most familiar problems around him, and through this connection method, combine the students' perceptual knowledge in practice with the rational knowledge taught in the classroom. (3) Emphasize the unity of learning and application, and guide students to use the knowledge they have learned at any time. For example, let students use their own language to take notes to exercise their dictation ability. In this way, when they return to the organization, they can also take notes when listening to reports and attending large classes. In addition, from the rhetoric, sentence-making, content, tailoring, and material selection of compositions to the structure, we study the methods of writing work summaries and news articles. Arithmetic exercises are also closely combined with practical work, such as students in the Grain Bureau calculating public grain and rating land, and students in the printing factory calculating how many textbooks are printed in how many days.
    IV. Several Issues in Organization and Leadership
    Over the past three years, our cultural learning has been able to persist and gradually consolidate and develop. From the perspective of organizational leadership, there are the following experiences:
    (1) The great importance and direct leadership given by the Party committees at all levels to the cultural learning of cadres is the main key to running the school well. Under the direct leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, the Cultural Department of the Provincial Party Committee's Amateur Party School has not only received timely guidance in terms of learning policies and business ideas, but has also received appropriate solutions in terms of school equipment and material conditions. The Party Committee fully recognizes that cultural learning is the basis of political theory learning, and it is necessary to organize cadres with low cultural levels to conduct cultural learning in a down-to-earth manner. The branch organizations of each institution also directly lead the cultural learning of cadres in their own units, and regard this work as one of the important tasks of the branch organization.
    (2) Full-time cadres and full-time teachers have been equipped, and division of labor and specific responsibilities have been implemented. Especially because there are full-time teachers, a regular practice of assignments and corrections has been established, and specific guidance has been given to students. This is an important link to improve learning effectiveness and consolidate learning emotions.
    (3) A strict learning system has been established: there are leave, make-up leave, and cancellation leave systems; withdrawal, examination, make-up examination, and make-up class systems; various meeting systems and criticism and commendation systems. The establishment of these systems and encouraging students to consciously abide by them have become a huge driving force for promoting learning.
    (4) Establish class management work: In addition to teachers, class leaders, and directors, there is a class chairman in the students who is responsible for the administrative work of the class and grasps the students' ideological situation. There are also class representatives for each subject to supervise and check homework and be responsible for business guidance. Classes are divided into groups, and they realize their own management through class meetings and group leader joint meetings. Experience over the past few years has proved that the class management method has enabled the scattered amateur cultural learning to be managed in a more centralized way, and has played a huge organizational role in implementing the education plan.
    (5) Teachers have established a collective lesson preparation system, and organized observation and teaching, and studied teaching experience in a guided and planned way. In this way, teachers have also improved their business ability and teaching quality.
    (6) Cultivate outstanding students and models, and drive all students through these people to become a powerful backbone in school learning.
    Of course, the cultural learning work of the organizations directly under the Jilin Provincial Committee still has many shortcomings, mainly reflected in the emphasis on Chinese language learning and insufficient attention to natural sciences. There are still many problems worth studying in the formulation of the school system. Some teachers have limited levels and the quality of lectures is not high. In particular, part-time teachers cannot correct students' homework and cannot do regular class guidance, which also affects the learning effect to a certain extent. All of these must be improved in the future.

    中共吉林省委直属机关的干部文化学习
    中共吉林省委宣传部理论教育处处长　董速
    一、文化学习阵地在日益发展
    吉林省委直属机关业余党校文化部，从一九五○年创办以来，已三年多了。开创当时，因为缺乏经验，学员们还没亲身体验到文化学习的好处，因而情绪不高，出席情况不好；教员数量不够，质量也低。三年来经领导方面及全体教员与学员不懈的努力，克服了各种困难，从一九五一年初，文化学习即步入一个新的阶段，出现了文化学习的高潮。现有学员一千八百五十六名，专职教员十二名，兼职教员十七名。从文盲的速成识字班到高中班，共二十八个班。学习科目：初小、高小都学语文、算术。初中学语文、算术、历史、政治常识。高中是语文专修（今年计划将高中班分成文、理两科。文科是继续提高干部的语文程度，理科是适应经济建设的需要，提高企业部门干部的业务技术水平）。学制是：速成识字班，三个月毕业，认识两千字。初小二年毕业。高小一年毕业。初中二年毕业。高中语文专修一年毕业。这样，从文盲到高中毕业，只需六年零三个月的期间，大大缩减了学习过程，带着很大的速成性质。
    参加文化学习的，不但有科长、科员、勤杂人员，还有局、处长干部六十六人。不但有青年同志，还有年逾五十的老同志。因为学习确实提高了他们的文化程度和工作能力，所以学习情绪饱满，每天晚饭后都有熙熙攘攘的人群，挟着书本走向学校；女同志赶快给小孩喂完奶就走，残废军人拄着拐杖，来的更早，还有从十里地外赶来学习的。有时停电了，大家自己带着蜡烛，在烛光下坚持学习。学习已成了大家生活不可缺少的部分。因为下乡没参加测验的同志，回来就到学校要求补考，或把作业寄回学校请教员批改。大家都感到学校是培养自己的良好园地，都热烈地爱护它，关心它。每逢纪念节日就给学校写信，送纪念品。毕业出校的同志也深深怀念着学校。
    二、三年来文化学习的收获
    三年来，由文盲提到初小毕业程度的已有四百八十人。由初小一年提到高小毕业程度的已有七百五十人。由高小一年提到初中毕业程度的已有七百五十人。由初中毕业出校的共有七百八十人。一九五三年将有二百二十人由高中语文专修毕业。不少同志由于提高了文化，工作做的更好了，由科员提为股长、科长。还有不少同志，由做勤杂或保管工作改做收发、会计、文书工作。炊事员、保姆同志也做了打字员、会计。一个革命残废军人同志，原是文盲，又在作战中失掉了右手，现在用左手能写整齐的笔记、通讯稿子，又能做预决算。省法院邵云芳同志，过去是一个只字不识的五十多岁的老太太，现在学会了记账、算账、读东北日报，还当了机关支部的学习委员。由于文化水平提高了，大家也提高了分析、归纳问题的能力，学会综合与整理材料。做档案工作、管理材料的同志说：“分类卡片整得更有条理，更细致了。”在企业部门工作的同志，学会了量立方公尺、计算面积容量和物价指数。会计同志因为算术程度的提高，缩短了整理传票账目的时间。管理员、事务员由于学习，管账不错，也不乱了。财政厅仓库一个管理油桶的同志说：“过去多少油桶装多少油老也算不出，还得到处找人帮助，常要耽误工作，心里蹩曲透了。现在呢，我学会了除法，很快就能算出桶的数目，工作效果提高啦。”经过学习历史，丰富了史实知识，给政治常识的学习打下良好基础。过去在许多工农干部中“大老粗、吃不开”的情绪已经被学习的热情和信心所代替了。很多文化水平较低的干部，由于文化水平提高了，已参加了理论学习。
    三、教学方法和几个主要的经验
    文化学习的根本目的是提高学员文化水平，提高工作效率，并为政治理论学习打下良好基础。参加文化学习的同志的特点是：斗争和生活经验丰富、理解力强，书本知识少，不习惯于系统的脑力活动。为了达到学习目的，适应上述特点，教学总的方法是：启发思考，重点深入，联系实际，反复练习，并且这几个环节还要紧密结合。
    启发思考：在讲授与作业中，除教员做生动的讲解外，必须结合课文，引导学员动脑筋思考，发表自己的看法，展开讨论，然后教员再进行批判总结。这样做的好处是可以了解学员进步程度，启发学员用脑思考，提高学员研究问题的兴趣。这样启发讨论，并不占过多的时间，仍不影响以讲课为主的方针。
    重点深入：因为学员是业余学习，精力、时间有限，讲课内容必须精练有中心。在一定时期中使学员耳听、眼见、脑里想的，都集中一个中心问题上面。这样才能收到最大效果。如：讲单句构造时，不论在讲授、复习或作业批改中，教员都围绕这一问题，进行反复的讲解。又如在一定时期内，抓住普遍常犯的错别字，反复讲解，集中力量消灭它。此外，还应让学员反复练习。
    联系实际：（一）教材内容与当前政治实际的联系：除讲固定课本外，经常选些国内外新鲜事件、杂志、报纸上的主要文章，作为补充教材。如：
    “三反”时在高小、初中班普遍学习“一贯保持艰苦朴素作风的共产党员——张子良”一课，结合第三届国庆节讲“光荣归于伟大的毛泽东”。（二）教学方法与学员实践经验的联系。即讲授时，要联系他身边最熟悉的问题，去解释说明，通过这种联系方法，把学员实践中的感性知识与课堂讲授的理性知识结合起来。（三）强调学用一致，随时引导学员运用学过的知识。如让学员用自己语言来记笔记锻炼其听写能力。这样，他们回到机关，听报告、上大课时也就能记笔记了。此外，从作文的修辞、造句、内容、剪裁、取材，直到结构等方面，都联系研究写工作总结及通讯稿子的方法。算术演题，也密切结合工作实际，如粮食局学员，演算计公粮，评地级等题目，印刷工厂学员演算多少天印多少课本的题目。
    四、组织与领导方面的几个问题
    三年来，我们的文化学习，所以能够坚持，并日臻巩固和发展，从组织领导方面看，有下面几点经验：
    （一）各级党委对干部的文化学习，给予极大的重视和直接领导是办好学校的主要关键。省委业余党校文化部，在省委宣传部直接领导下，不但在学习方针及业务思想方面，得到了及时指导，在学校设备及物质条件上，也得到了适当的解决。党委充分认识到文化学习是政治理论学习的基础，必须组织文化水平低的干部踏踏实实地进行文化学习。各机关支部也直接领导了本单位干部的文化学习，把这一工作当做支部重要任务之一。
    （二）配备了专职干部和专职教员，实行了分工与专责。特别因为有了专职教员，因而建立了经常的作业练习与作业批改，进行了对学员的具体指导。这是提高学习效果巩固学习情绪的重要环节。
    （三）建立了严密的学习制度：有请假、补假、消假制度；退学、考试、补考、补课制度；各种会议制度及批评表扬制度。这些制度的建立并鼓励学员自觉地遵守，就成为推进学习的巨大动力。
    （四）建立了班级管理工作：除教员、级任、主任外，在学员里设班主席，负责班里行政工作，掌握学员思想情况。并设有各科的课代表，督促检查作业，负责业务指导。班下分小组，通过班务会及小组长联席会，实现他们自己对自己的管理。几年来经验证明，班级管理方法，使分散的业余文化学习，得到了比较集中的管理，对贯彻教育计划上起了巨大的组织作用。
    （五）教员建立了集体备课制度，并组织观摩教学，有领导、有计划地研究教学经验。这样，教员也就提高了业务能力和教学质量。
    （六）培养学习优秀分子及模范，通过这些人带动全体学员，成为学校学习中有力的骨干。
    当然，吉林省委直属机关的文化学习工作还有许多缺点，主要表现在强调了语文学习，对自然科学注意不够。在学制的规定上，还有许多值得研究的问题，有的教员因程度所限，讲课质量不高，特别是兼职教员，因不能给学员批改作业，不能做经常的班级指导工作，也在一定程度上影响到学习效果。所有这些，都须在今后改进。
