    Overcoming the Backwardness of Literary and Artistic Creation
    Xia Yan
    Compared with our country's brilliant achievements in all fields, it is unnecessary—and impossible to deny—that our literary and artistic work (especially the creation of dramas and films) is "lagging behind in the face of the entire people." The achievements we have made in literature and art in the three years since liberation are not only far from meeting the needs of the country and the people, not only have not produced more and better works that reflect the great struggle of the Chinese people, but also suffer from serious ideological confusion, and have even produced some erroneous and harmful works.
    After the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and after the nationwide mass rectification and study movement in literature and art, it should be admitted that the ideological remolding and study movement over the past year or so has achieved certain results among literary and art workers. Serious ideological confusion has begun to be clarified, various erroneous non-working-class ideas have been severely criticized, and the principle that "literary and artistic work must be guided by the ideology of the working class as the only guiding ideology" has been recognized by the majority of literary and art workers. Hundreds and thousands of writers, actors, painters, and musicians have devoted themselves to the fiery struggle of the people, and 1952 has also produced a number of gratifying works loved by the people. However, we must soberly recognize here that verbally acknowledging and rationally recognizing "the ideology of the working class as the only guiding ideology" is only the beginning of literary and art workers' departure from the non-working-class position and their adoption of the working-class position. After one study and participation in one struggle, it is still only a starting point for rectifying the literary and art ranks and strengthening life experience. To enable literary and art workers of different backgrounds and education to truly "change from one class to another," to truly enable them to observe and judge things with the thoughts and feelings of the working class, it is undoubtedly necessary to carry out serious and arduous study and long-term and in-depth training.
    Strengthening ideological study and long-term in-depth immersion in life are the most frequently raised issues in the rectification and study movement in literature and art, and also the most urgent issues to be addressed after the rectification. Recognizing the importance of these two from work inspections, recognizing that only by mastering the most advanced ideology and being familiar with the richest life can we write excellent works that meet the needs of the people, is a major gain of the rectification and study. Therefore, it is completely correct and necessary for the majority of literary and art workers to urgently demand strengthening ideological study and in-depth life training after the rectification. However, even on the issues of strengthening ideological study and in-depth life training, our literary and art workers' understanding is still not clear, and their views are still not consistent. In other words, there still seems to be no clear solution to the specific issues of how to strengthen ideological study and how to delve into life. That is to say, there is still no unified understanding or clear direction on these two basic issues.
    Regarding the issue of strengthening ideological study, many people still see it as simple, superficial, narrow, and one-sided. Some people think that study is a "movement," and once the movement is over, it can be put away, without realizing that this is a career that everyone engaged in literary and artistic work must undertake frequently, persistently, and with all their efforts throughout their lives. Some people think that what needs to be studied is only "things related to literature and art," and that international and domestic political events "have nothing to do with my work," so they unknowingly return to the old path of detachment from politics. Of course, there are also people who equate studying politics with studying policies, thinking that what must be studied are only the articles and decisions directly related to the themes they want to write about. The materials obtained from the Shanghai literary and art rectification and study and a general knowledge test held after the rectification show that a large number of literary and art workers lack basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, lack concern for major international and domestic political issues, lack historical knowledge of the world and China, lack basic knowledge of natural science, and even lack common sense related to daily life that a victorious Chinese people must possess. Not to mention the "ideological lazybones" who often do not read newspapers or do not read them regularly, even among literary and art cadres who bear considerable responsibility, even after the literary and art rectification, the atmosphere of studying Marxism-Leninism, studying politics, and earnestly caring about national affairs and people's lives is weak. As early as twelve years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in "Reform Our Study" that the three "extremely bad styles" of "not paying attention to the study of current conditions, not paying attention to the study of history, and not paying attention to the application of Marxism-Leninism" still exist among our literary and art workers, and even continue to "spoil" our ranks. In his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov said: "The strength and significance of realistic art lies in the fact that it can and must discover and express the noble spiritual qualities and typical, positive characteristics of ordinary people, and create bright artistic images of ordinary people worthy of being models and objects of emulation." "The typical is not only the most common thing, but also the thing that most fully and sharply expresses the essence of a certain social force." Therefore, as a literary and art worker, as an "engineer of the human soul," only by arming oneself with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, only by mastering the most advanced socialist and communist ideology of the working class, only when he has a clear love and hate and a clear attitude of support and opposition towards the emerging social forces and the dying social forces, can he stand at the forefront of the ideological front, can he discover and express the noble spiritual qualities of ordinary people, can he discover the most essential things from all social phenomena that are not common today but will become common tomorrow, and can he "truly, historically, and concretely depict reality in the development of the revolution." Not focusing on the study of Marxist-Leninist ideology, not focusing on the study of the application of Marxism-Leninism, not focusing on the study of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of China, and not first cultivating one's broad and keen ability to distinguish political and social phenomena, so-called "study" is nothing more than decoration and empty talk. Chairman Mao said:
    "It is right for literary and art workers to study literary and artistic creation, but Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers cannot be an exception. In addition, they must also study society, that is, to study the various classes in society, their interrelationships and individual conditions, their appearance and their psychology. Only when these are clarified can our literature and art have rich content and a correct direction." From today's perspective, such study is a "make-up class" for literary and art workers in political study. If we do not seize the opportunity to strengthen this most basic link with a correct attitude, our literary and artistic work cannot be improved, cannot move forward, and cannot catch up with the rapidly advancing reality.
    The second is the issue of going deep into life. After the rectification and study, literary and art workers deeply felt the distance between themselves and the working people, and understood the importance of the combination of literary and art workers and the working people. Therefore, they urgently demanded to go to the countryside and factories to experience life, transform themselves, and draw creative materials from the ocean of the people's lives. There is no doubt that this understanding is correct and this determination is commendable. However, before going to the countryside and factories, what kind of mental preparation should we have, with what kind of thoughts and feelings should we approach the working people, how should we observe, experience, study, and analyze the life and struggle of the working people? We lack a clear understanding and direction on these issues. Some people think that going to the countryside and factories is a "manifestation" of their determination to transform themselves. Some people separate life experience from creation, one-sidedly thinking that the purpose of going to the countryside and factories is only "ideological transformation." Others, on the contrary, think that the purpose of going to the countryside and factories is only to collect creative materials, browsing and observing with an "objective" attitude that is indifferent to the real life of the people, so that the main effort is concentrated on certain trivial details of production technology. In general, the purpose of going to the countryside and factories is not clear enough.
    Why is the purpose of going to the countryside and factories not clear enough? Apart from the shortcomings in the leadership of literary and artistic work that will be discussed later, the root cause is still a matter of ideology, a matter of position, and a matter of understanding the socialist realistic creation method. Without the most advanced socialist ideology, one cannot truly understand the laws of life development; without a clear working-class position, one cannot have clear love and hate for characters and events. And if a literary and art worker who goes to the countryside and factories cannot correctly understand the laws of life development, and if he does not have a clear love and hate for characters and events, then it is impossible to integrate with the masses, impossible to go deep into the lives of the masses, and impossible to use his own thoughts and feelings to get close to the thoughts and feelings of the masses. To get close, to establish feelings, one must first understand. How to understand? Relying on visiting with notebooks, listening to summary reports, looking at material records, and checking production figures cannot reveal their spiritual qualities and typical characteristics. Standing in front of us are living people with various different thoughts and feelings, with various different living habits, and with various different origins and experiences, not substances that can be measured with test tubes and balances. Therefore, to discover and express their noble spiritual qualities and typical positive characteristics, one must first understand their lives, including their language, habits, history, thoughts, and feelings. What we want to write are literary and artistic works with characters, personalities, contradictions, and struggles, not simply a work report explaining the course of an event. Our goal is to discover and express the noble spiritual qualities and typical positive characteristics of ordinary people, and to create bright artistic images of ordinary people who are worthy of being models and objects of emulation. Therefore, the responsibility and task of literary and art workers are to participate in their lives, understand, think, familiarize themselves with and love their lives, make themselves breathe in the same way as their struggle lives, have the same interests, fully occupy materials that conform to the laws of life development, and then artistically generalize and emphasize them, and create an artistic power that is sufficient to convince and easily infect people. Not focusing on writing about characters, not starting from life, starting from concepts, then even if "works" are written, even if there are no policy errors, at best they are nothing more than "conceptual plus examples" type of "mediocre, dull, gray works."
    In addition to the above problems, there is also a problem that makes writers feel very confused, but actually greatly hinders writers from engaging in writing with the correct creative methods. That is, until today, in the leadership of literary and artistic work and among critics, there are still many people who mechanically understand the political tasks of literary and artistic works, and require every literary and artistic form and every literary and artistic work to cooperate with the current practical work in various aspects, and require them to be able to quickly reflect every specific policy at that time and place. These people equate certain literary and artistic forms that can "quickly cooperate with current political tasks" (such as cartoons, essays, street poetry, etc.) with novels, dramas, film scripts, etc., and simply—and vulgarly—interpret the principle of art serving politics as "various literary and artistic works can only be propaganda tools for the current central political tasks." So they designate themes, designate subjects, and designate stories, requiring writers to write novels, dramas, and even films within a certain short period of time. The literary and art leadership in some places demanded that writers quickly write works reflecting a political movement before the movement was even launched. The literary and art leadership in other places put forward requirements to literary writers participating in the "land reform," requiring them to include all policies related to land reform in their works. This requirement and encouragement from the literary and artistic leadership and critics cannot but affect the writers' thoughts and creative methods, which actually promotes the above-mentioned tendencies after going to the factories and the countryside: not focusing on studying characters but focusing on studying events, not focusing on studying the spiritual qualities of heroes but focusing on studying their working methods and techniques, not focusing on studying the relationship between people and people in a specific environment and the changes in thoughts and feelings, but focusing on studying the specific implementation of policy articles... Literary works are different from political essays, and novels, dramas, and films should not be regarded as "policy readers." Literary works should write about people, write about real people, literary works should write about life, write about real life; therefore, literary workers must deeply study life and correctly reflect reality, so as to create positive artistic images, and use this heroic image with strong persuasiveness and infectiousness, which makes people spontaneously admire and imitate, to inspire the people, educate the people, cultivate the people's noble morality, beautiful sentiments, and improve the people's spiritual qualities; and this is precisely to carry out a profound political education for the people, let the people recognize the new today, let the people compare the new today with the old yesterday, and willingly bid farewell to yesterday. This is the task of literature and art, and this is the different characteristic of literary and artistic work from other propaganda work. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Promising writers and artists must go to the masses, must go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and with all their heart, to the fiery struggle, to the only broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creative process, so as to unify raw materials and production, and unify the research process and the creative process." He also said: "...Literature and art organize, concentrate, and typify this daily phenomenon, creating literary works or works of art, which can awaken the masses, inspire them, and promote the masses to unite and struggle, and implement the transformation of their environment." From this, it can be seen that not advocating going deep into life, not reflecting the complexity, diversity, and contradictions of life, rudely trying to instill concepts and techniques into works, or forcibly letting the protagonists shout a few policy slogans, will never create works that are loved by the people and can educate the people.
    Due to the rapid progress of our country, the ideological and cultural level of the Chinese people has been greatly improved, and the people are enthusiastically demanding better and more literary and artistic works, and their requirements, as Gorky said, are "very strict"; "they do not regard literature and art as anything else, but only as a weapon to support them or oppose them." The stricter the people's demands on us, the greater our responsibility. How to overcome the backwardness of literary and artistic work, how to create works worthy of the people, our direction of effort has been determined. Let us more earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, more deeply participate in the struggle of the people, more assiduously study artistic business, and produce works with high ideological and artistic value to answer the concerns of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people.

    克服文艺创作的落后状况
    夏衍
    和我们国家在各方面的辉煌成就对比起来，不必——也不可能讳言，我们的文学艺术工作（特别是戏剧电影的创作），是“当着全体人民的面前而落后了”。解放三年以来我们在文艺上所达到的成就，不仅远不能适应国家和人民的要求，不仅还没有产生更多与更好的足以反映中国人民伟大斗争的作品，而且还存在着严重的思想混乱，还产生过一些错误的、有害的作品。
    经过中共中央所发起的“武训传”批判，经过全国规模的群众性的文艺整风学习，应当承认，这一年多的思想改造学习运动在文艺工作者之间已经取得了一定的成绩。严重的思想混乱已经开始澄清，各种错误的非工人阶级思想已经受到了严厉的批判，“文艺工作必须以工人阶级思想为唯一的领导思想”这一原则已经为广大文艺工作者所承认，上百成千的作家、演员、画家、音乐工作者已经投身到人民群众的火热斗争，一九五二年也已经产生了若干可喜的、为人民群众所爱好的作品。但是，在此我们必须清醒地认识，口头上承认和理性上认识“工人阶级思想为唯一的领导思想”仅仅是文艺工作者脱离非工人阶级立场而取得工人阶级立场的一个开端，经过一次学习和参加一次斗争，也还不过是整顿文艺队伍和加强生活锻炼的一个起点。要使各种出身不同、教养不同的文艺工作者真正能做到“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”，要使他们真正能用工人阶级的思想感情来观察和判断事物，无疑地还须要认真而刻苦的学习、长期而深入的锻炼。
    加强思想学习和长期深入生活，是文艺整风学习中提得最多的问题，也是文艺整风后要求得最迫切的问题。从工作检查中认识到这两者的重要，认识到只有掌握了最先进的思想和熟悉了最丰富的生活才能写出优秀的、符合人民要求的作品，这是整风学习的一个重大的收获，因此，广大的文艺工作者在整风之后急迫地要求加强思想学习和深入生活锻炼，完全是正确的，必要的。但是，就是在加强思想学习和深入生活锻炼这两个问题上，我们文艺工作者认识还是不明确，看法还是不一致的。换句话说，就是对于怎样来加强思想学习、怎样来深入生活的具体问题，似乎依然还没有得到明确的解决。也就是说，对于这两个带有基本性质的问题还没有一个统一的认识，明确的方针。
    对于加强思想学习这一个问题，还有很多人看得很简单，很肤浅，很狭窄，很片面。有的人以为学习是一个“运动”，运动一过就可以收起，而没有认识到这是每一个从事文艺工作的人必须经常地、持久地、毕生全力以赴的事业。有的人以为要学习的只是“与文艺有关的事情”，国际与国内的政治事件“和我的业务没有关系”，因此就不知不觉地重新回到了脱离政治的老路。当然也有人在学习政治和学习政策之间加了一个等号，以为必须学习的只是和我要写的题材直接有关的若干条文和决定。上海文艺整风学习中所得到的材料，和在整风后举行过一次常识测验证明，很大一部分文艺工作者缺乏马克思列宁主义的基本知识，缺乏对国际国内重大政治问题的关心，缺乏世界和中国的历史知识，缺乏自然科学基本知识，乃至和日常生活有关的、作为一个胜利了的中国人民所必须具备的常识。且不说经常不看报或者不经常看报的“思想上的懒汉”，即使在担负着相当责任的文艺干部之间，即使在经过了文艺整风之后，学习马克思列宁主义，学习政治，认真地关心国家大事和人民生活的空气是稀薄的。早在十二年前毛主席在“改造我们的学习”所指出过的“不注重研究现状，不注重研究历史，不注重马列主义的应用”这三种“极坏的作风”，依然在我们文艺工作者之间存在，甚至还在继续地
    “带坏”我们的队伍。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的报告中说：“现实主义艺术的力量和意义就在于：它能够而且必须发掘和表现普通人的高尚的精神品质和典型的、正面的特质，创造值得做别人的模范和效仿对象的普通人的明朗的艺术形象。”“典型不仅是最常见的事物，而且是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质的事物。”因此，作为一个文艺工作者，作为一个“人类的灵魂的工程师”，只有用马克思列宁主义的思想来武装了自己，只有掌握了工人阶级的最先进的社会主义共产主义的思想，只有当他对于新生的社会力量和垂死的社会力量之间具有了明确的爱憎、鲜明的拥护与反对的态度，他才能站在思想战线的前列，才能发掘和表现普通人的高尚的精神品质，才能从一切社会现象中去发现今天还不常见而明天就会变成常见的最本质的事物，才能“真实地、历史地、具体地把现实在革命的发展中刻划出来”。不着重研究马克思列宁主义思想，不着重研究马克思列宁主义的运用，不着重学习马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国实际相结合的毛泽东思想，不首先培养自己对政治和社会现象的广阔而敏锐的辨别能力，所谓“学习”只不过是装饰和空谈。毛主席说：
    “文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的，但是马列主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。此外还要学习社会，就是要研究社会上的各个阶级，它的相互关系和个别状况，它们的面貌和它们的心理。只有把这些弄清楚了，我们的文艺才能有丰富的内容和正确的方向。”在今天来看，这样的学习是文艺工作者在政治学习中的
    “补课”，不抓紧时机用正确的态度来补强这一最基本的环节，我们的文艺工作就不可能改善，不可能向前，就不可能赶上飞跃前进的现实。
    其次是深入生活的问题。文艺工作者经过了整风学习，痛切地感觉到自己和劳动人民之间的距离，懂得了文艺工作者与劳动人民结合的重要，因此而迫切地要求下乡下厂去锻炼生活，改造自己，和从人民群众的生活海洋中去汲取创作的材料。毫无疑问，这认识是正确的，这决心是可贵的。可是，下乡下厂之前我们应该有怎样的精神准备，我们应该以怎样的思想感情去接近劳动人民，怎样去观察、体会、研究和分析劳动人民的生活和斗争，我们之间就缺少一个明确的认识和方针。有的人认为下乡下厂是决心改造自己的“表示”。有的人把生活锻炼和创作割裂开来，片面地认为下乡下厂的目的只是“思想改造”。也有人相反地认为下乡下厂的目的只是搜集创作材料，以一种“客观”的、对人民群众的现实生活无动于中的态度去浏览观察，以致把主要的力量集注在某些生产技术上的细微末节。总起来说，就是下乡下厂的目的性不够明确。
    为什么下乡下厂的目的性不够明确，除出后面要讲的文艺工作领导方面的缺点之外，归根结底还是一个思想问题、立场问题、和对社会主义的现实主义创作方法的理解问题。没有最先进的社会主义的思想，就不能真正了解生活发展的规律，没有明确的工人阶级的立场，对人物和事件就不能有分明的爱憎；而一个下乡下厂的文艺工作者假如不能正确地了解生活发展的规律，假如对人物和事件没有明确的爱憎，那就不可能和群众打成一片，不可能深入群众生活，不可能用自己的思想感情去贴近群众的思想感情。要接近，要建立感情，就先得去了解。怎样去了解？靠拿着笔记本子去访问，听总结报告，看材料记录，查生产数字，是不能发掘到他们的精神品质和典型特征的。站在我们前面的是具有各种不同思想感情，具有各种不同生活习惯，具有各种不同出身经历的活生生的人物，而不是可以用试管和天平去测定的物质，因此，要发掘和表现他们的高尚的精神品质，和典型的正面的特质，首先就必须了解包括语言、习惯、历史、思想、感情在内的他们的生活。我们要写的是有人物、有性格、有矛盾、有斗争的文艺作品，而不是单单说明一个事件经过的工作报告。我们要达到的目的是发掘和表现普通人的高尚的精神品质和典型的、正面的特质，而创造出值得做人模范和效仿对象的普通人的明朗的艺术形象。因此，文艺工作者的职责和任务是在参加他们的生活，认识、思考、熟悉和热爱他们的生活，使自己与他们的斗争生活呼吸相通，利害一致，详细占有合乎生活发展规律的材料，然后加以艺术的概括和强调，而创造出一种足以使人信服和易于使人感染的艺术的力量。不着重写人物，不从生活出发，从概念出发，那么即使写出了“作品”，即使没有政策上的错误，充其极也不过是“概念加举例”式的“平庸乏味的灰色的作品”而已。
    除出上述的问题之外，还有一个很使作家们感到困惑，而实际上却是大大地阻碍了作家们用正确的创作方法来从事写作的问题。这就是直到今天为止，在文艺工作的领导方面和批评工作者之间，也还有很多人机械地理解了文艺作品的政治任务，而要求每一种文艺形式和每一个文艺作品都来配合当前各个方面的实际工作，要求它们能够迅速地反映当时当地的每一个具体政策的问题。这些人把可以“迅速配合当前政治任务”的某些文艺形式（如漫画、杂文、街头诗、……）和长篇小说、戏剧、电影剧本等等混同起来，把艺术为政治服务这个原则方针简单地——也是庸俗地解释为“各种文艺作品都只能是当前中心政治任务的宣传工具”。于是他们就指定主题，指定题材，指定故事，要求作家在一定的短促时期之内写成小说、戏剧、乃至电影。有些地方的文艺领导方面在一个政治运动还没有展开之前就要求作家迅速地写出反映这个运动的作品。另一些地方的文艺工作领导方面对参加“土地改革”的文艺作家提出要求，要他们把所有有关土地改革的政策都包括在作品之内。文艺工作领导方面和批评工作者们这种要求和鼓励，不能不影响到作家的思想和创作方法，这就实际上助长了上面说过的下厂下乡之后不着重研究人物而着重研究事件，不着重研究英雄人物的精神品质而着重研究他们的工作方法技术，不着重研究在特定环境之下的人与人的关系，思想感情的变化，而着重研究政策条文的具体执行……这一些偏向。文艺作品有别于政治论文，小说戏剧电影不应该看作“政策读本”。文艺作品要写人，要写真实的人，文艺作品要写生活，要写真实的生活；因此文艺工作者必须深刻地研究生活，正确地反映现实，这样才能创造出正面的艺术形象，用这种具有强大说服力和感染力的、使人油然而生爱慕与效仿之心的英雄形象，来鼓舞人民，教育人民，来培养人民的高尚道德，优美情操，来提高人民的精神品质；而这样，也正就是对人民进行了深刻的政治教育，让人民认识新的今天，让人民把新的今天与旧的昨天比较，而心甘情愿地和昨天诀别。这是文艺的任务，这是文艺工作与别的宣传工作不同的特点。毛主席指示过我们说：“有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产、把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。”又说：“……文艺就把这种日常的现象组织起来，集中起来，典型化，造成文学作品或艺术作品，就能使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境。”由此可知，不提倡深入生活，不反映生活的复杂、多样与矛盾，粗暴地想把概念和技术贯注到作品里面，或者牵强地让主人公喊出几句政策口号，是决不能创作出为人民所喜爱而又能教育人民的作品的。
    由于我们国家的飞跃进步，中国人民的思想和文化水平已经大大地提高了，人民热烈地要求着更好与更多的文艺作品，而他们的要求，正如高尔基所说：是“非常严峻的”；“他们不把文艺看作别的东西，而只看作是拥护他们或者反对他们的一种武器”。人民对我们的要求愈严格，我们的责任愈重大。如何克服文艺工作的落后状况，如何来创造无愧于人民的作品，我们的努力方向是确定了的。让我们更认真地学习马克思列宁主义，更深入地参加人民群众的斗争，更刻苦地钻研艺术业务，产生出具有高度思想性和艺术性的作品，来回答党、毛主席、和人民群众对我们的关注吧。
