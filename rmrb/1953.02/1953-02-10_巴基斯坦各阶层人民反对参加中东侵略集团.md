Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 8th dispatch: People from all strata of Pakistan have expressed great indignation at the US imperialist plot to drag Pakistan into the Middle East aggression bloc.

Pakistani newspapers have continuously exposed the aggressive intentions of the United States. The "Today" newspaper, in a commentary on February 1st on the recent remarks made by U.S. Rear Admiral Wright, commander of the U.S. Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Forces, in Karachi, wrote: According to Wright, the obligations imposed on Pakistan by the U.S. government include the following: 1. All areas, including the Bay of Bengal, are under his jurisdiction; 2. He controls the transportation in this area; 3. Since the U.S. military will take action here in the event of an "emergency," the navy under his jurisdiction must currently study the climate and other conditions in the area; 4. Because Pakistan is within Wright's jurisdiction, he hopes to inspect this area once or several times as needed.

Pir Mankli Sharif, Chairman of the All Pakistan Peace Committee, and Mahmud Ali Kasuri, Vice-Chairman, recently issued a joint statement to the press, denouncing the political conspiracy of Western imperialist countries that are piecing together the so-called "Middle East Defense Organization." They said that the U.S. and British imperialists organized such an aggressive bloc in an attempt to use the East as a springboard for a third world war.

The statement explained the attitude of Pakistani peace fighters and pointed out that the Pakistani people are eager for peace and do not want to participate in the aggressive "Middle East Bloc" and be "involved in a world war."

Dr. Halsa, Chairman of the All Pakistan Christian League, wrote in a letter to the editor of the "Pakistan Times" that the news about Pakistan being invited to join the "Middle East Command" and the recent visit of U.S. Vice Admiral Wright to Pakistan have shocked the democratic-loving people of this country. He went on to say that everyone knows that Western imperialist countries always want to drag peace-loving people into their aggressive plans and exploit their resources and manpower. The Pakistani people are unwilling to sacrifice their wealth for the benefit of foreigners.

    巴基斯坦各阶层人民反对参加中东侵略集团
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩讯：巴基斯坦各阶层人民对美帝国主义想把巴基斯坦拉进中东侵略集团的阴谋表示极大愤慨。
    巴基斯坦报纸不断揭露美国的侵略企图。“今天报”在二月一日评论美国东大西洋及地中海海军司令赖特最近在喀喇蚩发表的谈话时写道：据赖特说，美国政府加给巴基斯坦的义务共有下列几点：一、包括孟加拉湾在内的一切地区，由他管辖；二、这个地区的交通，由他控制；三、既然美国军队在一旦发生“非常事件”时，将在这里采取行动，那么归他管辖的海军目前就要研究这个地区的气候和其他条件；四、因为巴基斯坦是在赖特的管辖范围之内，所以他希望依照情况的需要，再到这地区视察一次或几次。
    全巴基斯坦和平委员会主席毕尔·曼基·沙里夫和副主席马茂德·阿里·卡苏里最近对报界发表联合声明，斥责正在拼凑所谓“中东防御组织”的西方帝国主义国家的政治阴谋。他们说，美英帝国主义者组织这样一个侵略集团，是想把东方作为第三次世界大战中的一个跳板。
    这个声明说明了巴基斯坦和平战士的态度，并且指出，巴基斯坦人民迫切希望和平，不愿意参加侵略性的“中东集团”而被“卷入世界战争”。
    全巴基斯坦基督教联盟主席哈尔萨博士在给“巴基斯坦时报”的编辑写的信中说：关于巴基斯坦被邀请参加“中东司令部”的消息以及美国赖特海军中将最近到巴基斯坦访问，使得这个国家爱好民主的人民大为震惊。他接着说道，谁都知道，西方帝国主义国家总想把爱好和平的人民拉入他们的侵略计划，并且利用他们的物资和人力。巴基斯坦人民不愿为了外国人的利益而牺牲他们的财富。
