Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 22nd: This is a report from our eastern front correspondent, Li Li: A night raid team of the Korean People's Army attacked enemy troops on Hill 811.7 south of Changseong-ri on the eastern front in the deep night of February 2nd. They killed or wounded over 200 soldiers of the Rhee Syngman's puppet army, destroyed 4 enemy tanks and 5 vehicles, and burned 5 enemy warehouses full of grain and ammunition. This was one of the more outstanding battles on the eastern front recently.

On the deep night of February 2nd, the moonlight was very bright, and the enemy's searchlights shone back and forth on their front lines. The Korean People's Army night raid team advanced towards the enemy's position in the snow, and the enemy did not notice them at all.

Our army's artillery fire destroyed the enemy's barbed wire and minefields in two or three minutes. Without giving the enemy a chance to catch their breath, the night raid team followed the shells and charged onto the enemy's position. There was a cluster of clover-shaped bunkers in front of the enemy's position. The first three bunkers had already been destroyed by our army's artillery fire, so the night raid team split up and rushed to the vicinity of the two remaining bunkers, using grenades to eliminate the enemy inside.

Afterwards, the night raid team divided into three groups and took advantage of the victory to penetrate deep into the enemy's position. Twenty minutes later, the middle group occupied the main peak of Hill 811.7, wiping out an enemy company headquarters. The left group, led by Company Commander Li Haoqing, charged more than 700 meters into the enemy's position, surrounding the enemy's tank position. At that time, the enemy's tanks had already started their engines, turning their rears, intending to escape. Li Haoqing first intercepted the lead tank and destroyed it with a grenade. When the enemy in the tanks behind saw that they could not escape, they opened the turrets and jumped out, trying to run away, but Deputy Group Leader Zhao Zhongxuan's machine gun "tat-tat-tat" swept them away. Thereupon, Li Haoqing and others burned all the remaining three tanks, four large vehicles, and one jeep, and destroyed an enemy radio station. The group on the right, led by Yu Bingguo, wiped out an enemy platoon command post and burned five enemy warehouses stockpiled with grain and ammunition. The fire illuminated half the sky, and the ammunition exploded for half the night.

In the battle, the warriors of the night raid team also paid attention to shouting at the enemy, pointing out a way out for the enemy soldiers. Warrior Li Mouhao blocked a large bunker and shouted loudly: "South Korean soldiers, don't sacrifice your lives for the American aggressors and the traitor Rhee Syngman. As long as you surrender your weapons, you will definitely be treated leniently by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies." The Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers who had not been killed heard the shouts and came out with their hands raised to surrender.

After eliminating the enemy on the position, the night raid team also repelled several enemy counterattacks, killing or wounding more than 40 enemy soldiers.

The night raid team penetrated deep into the enemy's territory and fought for nearly four hours. At dawn, under the cover of their own artillery fire, they escorted the prisoners and carried the spoils of war back to their own position.

    朝鲜人民军夜袭东线敌军阵地获得胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社东线记者李犁报道：朝鲜人民军的一支夜袭队，在二月二日深夜袭击东部前线长承里以南八一一点七高地上的敌军，杀伤李伪军二百多名，炸毁敌军坦克四辆、汽车五辆，并烧毁满装粮食弹药的敌军仓库五所。这是最近东线一次比较出色的战斗。
    二月二日深夜，月光很明亮，敌人的探照灯幌来幌去地照着他们的前沿。朝鲜人民军夜袭队在雪地里向敌人阵地前进，敌人一点都没有发觉他们。
    我军的炮火在两三分钟内就摧毁了敌人的铁丝网和地雷区。不容敌人喘息，夜袭队跟着炮弹冲上了敌军阵地。敌人阵地前沿有一片梅花形的地堡群，前面三个地堡已被我军炮火摧毁，夜袭队便分头冲到后面两个地堡附近，用手雷把敌人消灭在地堡里。
    以后，夜袭队便分兵三路乘胜插入敌军阵地的纵深。二十分钟后，中间一路占领了八一一点七高地的主峰，消灭了敌军一个连部。左边一路由连长李豪庆带领，冲入敌人阵地纵深七百多公尺，包围了敌人的坦克阵地。当时，敌人的坦克已经发动了马达，扭转屁股，打算逃跑。李豪庆首先截住了前头一辆，用手雷把它炸毁。后面坦克里的敌人见逃不脱，便掀开炮塔的盖子跳出来想跑，副组长赵钟铉的机枪“哒哒哒”一阵扫射便送掉了他们的性命。于是，李豪庆等便把剩下的三辆坦克、四辆大汽车、一辆吉普车全部烧毁，并炸毁了敌人一部电台。右边俞丙国带领的一路，消灭了敌人一个排的指挥所，还烧毁了敌人五所囤积粮弹的仓库，大火照红了半边天，弹药爆炸了半夜。
    在战斗中，夜袭队的勇士们也注意向敌人喊话，给敌军士兵指出生路。战士李?豪堵住一个大地堡大声喊道：“南朝鲜的士兵们，不要为美国侵略者和李承晚卖国贼卖命，只要你们交枪投降，一定得到朝中人民军队的宽待。”没有被打死的李伪军士兵听了喊话，便举着手走出来投降。
    消灭了阵地上的敌人以后，夜袭队还打退了敌人数次反扑，杀伤敌人四十多名。
    夜袭队插入敌人纵深，战斗了将近四个小时，到天色微明时，他们在自己炮火掩护下，押着俘虏，带着胜利品，回到了自己的阵地。
