    A Loyal Defender of the Interests of the Soviet State
    Marshal of the Soviet Union, S.M. Budyonny
    February 23, 1953, marks the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces. The Soviet people are striving to achieve ever-new successes in implementing Stalin's Fifth Five-Year Plan. They are commemorating this significant day in an atmosphere of great political and labor upsurge. Inspired by the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and his speech at the Congress, the Soviet people are advancing, holding high the banner of communism.
    The glorious Soviet Armed Forces are defending the peaceful and constructive labor of our people. They are vigilantly protecting our powerful motherland—the bulwark of peace and democracy throughout the world—and safeguarding the interests of our country. These interests are inseparable from the vital interests of ordinary people all over the world. That is why, on the glorious anniversary of the founding of our invincible army, the army of liberation, working people in all countries are joining the entire Soviet people in celebrating this festival wholeheartedly and enthusiastically. Ordinary people all over the world regard our motherland's armed forces as the force that broke the spine of the German fascist beast, crushed the German and Japanese fascist tyranny, and liberated the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement. The Soviet victory enabled the people of many countries in Europe and Asia to break free from the shackles of capitalist enslavement, embark on the road of building a new life, and take the road of socialism.
    The Soviet Armed Forces—the beloved sons of our people—are greeting their great anniversary with outstanding achievements in combat training and political cultivation, ready to execute any order of the socialist motherland.
    The Soviet Armed Forces, established and trained by the Communist Party, the great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, have traversed a glorious path of combat. Its entire history is a vivid example of heroism, selfless service to the socialist motherland, and the glorious fulfillment of the military duty to the Soviet people.
    The Soviet army, loved by the whole nation, is the greatest revolutionary force for combat. Its existence makes the enemies of the working class tremble with fear and gladdens all the oppressed and enslaved. The purpose of this army's existence and its social essence are fundamentally different from those of the armies of capitalist countries.
    As everyone knows, the armies of any bourgeois country are tools for supporting the capitalist regime and oppressing the working people. The armies of capitalist countries are armies for carrying out national and colonial oppression. They are trained to hate the people of other countries and to carry out aggression. The armies of the United States, Great Britain, France, and other capitalist countries are precisely armies of this imperialist nature.
    The Soviet army is the army of the first worker-peasant, socialist country in the world. Twenty-five years ago, Comrade Stalin, in his historic speech at the plenary session of the Moscow Soviet celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, profoundly and clearly revealed the true, popular essence of our army and its fundamental characteristics. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet army is the army of the liberated workers and peasants, the army of friendship among the various nationalities of our country. It is educated in the spirit of internationalism and respect for the people of other countries. Our army is strong and powerful precisely because it possesses these characteristics.
    The Soviet army was born and tempered in the fierce war of defending the Soviet regime, the truly people's regime, against foreign aggressors and domestic counter-revolutionaries. On January 28, 1918, the order to organize the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was signed, and two weeks later, the order to organize the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy was promulgated. On February 23, the young Soviet troops dealt a resolute blow to the German imperialist army in the battles near Narva and Pskov, stopping their advance towards Petrograd. This day became the birthday of the Soviet Army and an annual festival for the Soviet people.
    The Soviet Republic was soon in a situation where it was surrounded by fire on all sides. Imperialist bandits from the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries invaded our borders without declaring war. Every step they took on our land created horrific atrocities against the Soviet workers and peasants. The atrocities of the American plunderers were especially egregious. As the active organizers and instigators of anti-Soviet armed intervention, American imperialism, for the Russian people and the people of other nationalities in our country, was the most brutal executioner and gendarme.
    The great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, united the whole country into a unified fighting camp and launched our people into the Patriotic War. The Soviet army, strong because of its high political consciousness, with the strong support of the working people, crushed the armed interventionists and the White Guards, defended the freedom and independence of its socialist country, and defended the achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and its wise leaders, Lenin and Stalin, our people and their army won this victory. In organizing and leading the cause of defending the Soviet state, Comrade Stalin was Lenin's main assistant, the author of the most important military strategic plans, the leader of decisive battles, and the direct inspirer and organizer of the major victories of the Soviet army during the Civil War and foreign armed intervention.
    The first attempt by international imperialism to strangle and enslave the Soviet state failed. But the threat of a new military attack on our motherland was not eliminated. Therefore, it was necessary to consolidate the economic and defense strength of the Soviet state with all our might. The Lenin-Stalin party never forgot this, and it tirelessly ensured that our army was always ready for active defense. The party successfully implemented Lenin and Stalin's policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, making the Soviet Union a powerful country with socialist industry and collectivized agriculture. Due to the growth of socialist industry and its technological improvement, all branches of the Soviet army obtained first-class equipment. Our army has become a mechanized and motorized army, an army with excellent commanding officers who have received education in the foundations of Stalin's military science.
    Preparation for active defense was not limited to creating various material conditions that could ensure the rapid organization of military production in wartime and the continuous supply of food to the army and the people, and raw materials to industry. The Lenin-Stalin party also simultaneously prepared the country and the army for active defense in the political field. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Stalin, the party crushed the underground lairs of the Trotsky-Bukharin elements, thereby eliminating any possibility of a "fifth column" appearing in the Soviet Union in a timely manner. Comrade Malenkov said at the 19th Congress of the Party: "It is not difficult to understand that if we had not done this work in time, we would have been in a situation of being attacked from both the front and the rear during the war, and we might have failed in the war."
    The great development of the moral and political unity of the Soviet people, the development of friendship among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, and Soviet patriotism on the basis of the elimination of the exploiting classes and the victory of socialism are guarantees of the strength of the Soviet Union. The powerful strength of the Soviet Union was vividly manifested in the Great Patriotic War. This war was the most arduous of all the wars experienced by our motherland. This war involved the life and death of the Soviet state and the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.
    The German fascist aggressors, at the instigation of American imperialism, perfidiously and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, with the aim of destroying our socialist motherland and enslaving the Soviet people. Faced with the threat of death, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union united more closely around the Communist Party and around the great leader Comrade Stalin. The Soviet front and rear merged into one. The Communist Party turned all the strength of the people and the army towards the sole goal of defeating the enemy. The party explained the meaning and purpose of the war to the Soviet people, educated them to love the motherland, strengthened their fighting spirit, and instilled in them habits of fearlessness and discipline.
    Inspired and led by the genius commander Stalin, the Soviet army fought the German fascist bandits with the greatest tenacity, courage, and self-sacrifice. After exhausting the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties, the Soviet army turned from active defense to counter-offensive and demonstrated unparalleled examples of military art. The victory it won in fighting alone against the huge Hitler military machine built with the money of American and British millionaires is immortal.
    The Soviet army defeated the German fascist army near Moscow, crushed the enemy's attempt to encircle and occupy our capital, and buried the "blitzkrieg" plan. The great Battle of Stalingrad ended with the encirclement, annihilation, and capture of 330,000 elite enemy troops, laying the foundation for the fundamental turning point in World War II. The defeat of the Hitler bandits at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains shattered their plan to break through our oil region and tie down our main reserve military forces in the south. The Battle of Kursk ended the enemy's strategic offensive. The ten Stalinist devastating blows in 1944 ensured the transfer of military operations beyond our motherland and caused the complete collapse of the Hitler group.
    The victories we achieved in 1945, the brilliant battles in East Prussia, on the Vistula and Oder Rivers, near Budapest and Vienna, and the final capture of Berlin, are the most brilliant pages in the annals of our Great Patriotic War.
    The support of the Hitler bandits by their protectors across the ocean and elsewhere, their efforts to delay the opening of the Second Front in Europe, and their secret negotiations with the German fascists behind the back of the Soviet Union did not save the Hitler bandits from their shameful fate.
    The Great Patriotic War ended with the victory of our country over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, a victory of worldwide historical significance.
    The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, led by their elder brother—the great Russian nation—supported the combat of the Soviet Army and Navy. Comrade Stalin evaluated the selfless labor of the Soviet people in the rear, the achievements of the working class, collective farm peasants, and our intellectuals in the Great Patriotic War as unparalleled feats of defending the motherland.
    The Soviet Union crushed Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan, dealt a devastating blow to world reaction, and promoted the growth of democratic and socialist forces throughout the world. The Soviet people, our glorious Communist Party, honorably fulfilled their internationalist duty to the working people of all countries. The fraternal parties abroad praised the heroism and achievements of our party, giving our party the title of the "shock brigade" of the world revolution and the workers' movement. Comrade Stalin said at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "They expressed the hope that the success of this 'shock brigade' would alleviate the suffering of the people of all countries groaning under capitalist oppression. I believe that our party has not disappointed this hope, especially during the Second World War, when the Soviet Union crushed the fascist tyranny of Germany and Japan, liberating the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement."
    The victory won in the Great Patriotic War is the victory of our Soviet state and social system, the victory of our armed forces.
    The victory won by the Soviet people and their armed forces should be attributed to our leader and teacher, the wise leader and genius commander of the Soviet state, Comrade Stalin. Supreme Commander Stalin formulated and implemented the plan to crush the enemy, mobilizing all the material and spiritual forces of the Soviet socialist state to achieve victory. Therefore, our motherland overcame difficulties in the war that no bourgeois country could have endured. Stalin's military science demonstrated its full superiority over bourgeois military science on the battlefield.
    The Second World War, manufactured by international imperialist elements, led to results they had not anticipated. They attempted to destroy, or at least weaken, the Soviet Union and stifle the liberation movements of the masses in Europe and Asia. In reality, the opposite result was obtained.
    The Soviet Union became even stronger after the war. Its international prestige also grew unprecedentedly. Due to our victory, world imperialism was further weakened, while the forces of democracy and socialism were further consolidated and grew. Many countries in Central and Southeast Europe broke away from the capitalist system and laid the foundation for the people's democratic system. The great Chinese people established the free People's Republic, achieving a historically significant victory. The German Democratic Republic was established in Central Europe. Now one-third of humanity has escaped the oppression of imperialism. The united, powerful, and invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and achieving new and great successes.
    The imperialist aggressive camp, divided by internal contradictions and headed by the United States, is shaken by its constantly growing contradictions and seeks a way out by provoking a new world war. The American imperialists, colluding with international reactionaries, are carrying out a bandit-like war of aggression against the Korean people, forming various aggressive blocs, and rearming West Germany and Japan. American imperialists and their accomplices are waging a bloody war in Korea. They fabricate various plans to seize world hegemony, preparing to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The American imperialists are stepping up the dispatch of spies, saboteurs, and assassins to the countries of the socialist camp, which is an integral part of these most heinous plans.
    Like before the war, the Soviet people are striving for peaceful construction. They are inspired and led by the party of Lenin and Stalin, completing the industrial production part of the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, achieving new and powerful upsurges in industry, transportation, and agriculture, and further improving the cultural and material welfare of the working people.
    The tasks of 1951 and 1952, the first two years of the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan, have also been overfulfilled, thus creating favorable conditions for completing the entire Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This Five-Year Plan is a new and major step forward on the road of the Soviet Union's development from socialism to communism, which will further consolidate the economic foundation of our motherland's active defense forces.
    The Communist Party considers one of its most important tasks to be "striving to strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland to prevent enemy aggression." This lofty task of our party is in line with the wishes of all Soviet people, who spare no effort to strengthen the defense power of the socialist motherland and to improve the combat readiness of the Soviet armed forces.
    The Soviet people will forever remember Lenin and Stalin's warning: As long as imperialist countries exist, and as long as capitalist encirclement exists, the danger of armed attack by imperialist bandits against our motherland will still exist.
    Never forget that the greater our achievements, the more cunning the activities of the imperialists will be, and they will try every means to hinder our progress. People in our country with bourgeois views and bourgeois morality, hidden enemies of the Soviet people, act with their support. These poisonous insects try to bite us as hard as possible. The exposure of a group of insidious doctors, lackeys of American and British imperialism, despicable spies, and murderers proves this. Therefore, any manifestation of complacency and carelessness in our ranks must be thoroughly eradicated.
    Our people remember the capitalist encirclement, constantly strengthening the Soviet army and navy, and increasing vigilance against the plots of war instigators and their agents.
    The great leader and commander, Comrade Stalin, gave the Soviet army a major and glorious task: "Vigilantly protect the peaceful constructive labor of the Soviet people, firmly defend the national interests of the Soviet Union, and keep our motherland's borders inviolable to enemies."
    Soviet soldiers regard the glorious implementation of Comrade Stalin's instructions as their duty, and they strive at all times to achieve outstanding results in combat training and political cultivation.
    American imperialists and their agents do not hesitate to use intimidation. But this does not frighten the Soviet Union. Our people have great experience in fighting aggressors, and we are not novices in striking the enemy. The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, successfully defeated the enemy during the Civil War and also defeated the enemy during the Second World War. If the enemy dares to disturb our peaceful labor again, we will defeat them again.
    Minister of the Soviet Army, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Comrade Vasilevsky said at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The situation of the Soviet army's combat exercises and operational training, as well as its mobilization preparation and combat readiness, gives us full qualifications to assure the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin himself: The Soviet army will gloriously fulfill its task of protecting the constructive labor of the Soviet people and defending the national interests of the Soviet Union."
    The Soviet state has consistently pursued a policy of peace and cooperation among all nations, and our people do not want war. But if the enemy imposes war on us, they will suffer a painful blow.
    Comrade Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Party Congress: "Historical facts cannot be ignored. These facts show that as a result of the First World War, Russia broke away from the capitalist camp, and as a result of the Second World War, a series of countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist camp. We have every reason to infer that the Third World War will lead to the collapse of the world capitalist system."
    American war instigators should think about this prospect.
    During the period of the Soviet army's existence, all the imperialist bandits who tried to stick their snouts into our Soviet vegetable garden have been beaten to a pulp. If any aggressor dares to invade our motherland again, the Soviet army, supported by all the Soviet people, will always be ready to give them a devastating blow.

    苏联国家利益的忠实保卫者
    苏联元帅　谢·布琼尼
    一九五三年二月二十三日是苏联武装力量建立的三十五周年。苏联人民在执行斯大林第五个五年计划的宏伟任务中力求取得日新月异的成绩，他们正在巨大的政治和劳动高涨的气氛中，纪念这一具有重要意义的日子。为苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议、斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在代表大会上的演说所鼓舞的苏联人民，正在高举着共产主义的旗帜前进。
    光荣的苏联武装力量正在捍卫着我国人民的和平的、建设性的劳动。他们警觉地保卫着我们的强大的祖国——全世界和平与民主的堡垒，保卫着我们国家的利益；这些利益是和全世界普通人的切身利益分不开的。这就是为什么在我们无敌的军队、解放者军队的光荣的建军周年纪念时，各国劳动者要同苏联全体人民一道衷心地、热烈地庆祝这一节日的缘故。全世界的普通人都把我们祖国的武装力量看做是打断德国法西斯野兽的脊骨、粉碎德国和日本法西斯暴政、把欧亚两洲人民由法西斯奴役的威胁下解救出来的力量。苏联的胜利使欧洲和亚洲的许多国家的人民得以摆脱资本主义奴役的束缚，走向建设新生活的道路，走向社会主义的道路。
    苏联的武装力量——我国人民的爱子——正以在战斗训练和政治修养方面的卓越成绩来迎接自己的重大的周年纪念日，准备执行社会主义祖国的任何命令。一
    由共产党、劳动人民的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林所建立和训练的苏联武装力量，经历了光荣的战斗的道路。它的全部历史就是英雄主义、为社会主义祖国奋不顾身地服务、光辉地履行对苏联人民的军人职责的生动范例。
    为全民所爱戴的苏联军队，乃是最伟大的战斗的革命力量，它的存在使工人阶级的敌人心惊胆战、使所有被压迫和被奴役的人们欢欣鼓舞。这个军队存在的目的和它的社会本质是根本区别于资本主义国家军队的。
    大家知道，任何资产阶级国家的军队都是支持资本家政权、压迫劳动者的工具。资本主义国家的军队是一种进行民族和殖民地压迫的军队。他们所受的训练是憎恨别国人民和实行侵略。美国、大不列颠、法国和其他资本主义国家的军队正是这种帝国主义性质的军队。
    苏联的军队是世界上第一个工农的、社会主义国家的军队。二十五年以前，斯大林同志在庆祝苏军建军十周年的莫斯科苏维埃全体会议上所发表的历史性的演说中，深刻而明确地揭示了我国军队的真正的、人民的本质以及它的根本特点。斯大林同志指出，苏联军队是被解放了的工人和农民的军队，是我国各民族友好的军队。它受到国际主义精神和尊重其他国家人民精神的教育。我们的军队之所以强大和有力正是由于它具有这些特点。
    苏联的军队是在保卫苏维埃政权这个真正人民的政权，反对外国侵略者和国内反革命分子的激烈战争的炮火中诞生和锻炼出来的。一九一八年一月二十八日签署了关于组织工农红军的命令，两星期以后颁布了关于组织工农红海军的命令。二月二十三日，年轻的苏军部队便在纳尔瓦和普斯可夫附近的战斗中给了德国帝国主义的军队以坚决的打击，阻止了他们向彼得格勒的进攻。这一天便成了苏联军队的生日，成为苏联人民每年一度的节日。
    苏维埃共和国很快地就处于四面都是火线的形势中。美国、英国和其他资本主义国家的帝国主义强盗们不经宣战便侵入了我国边境。他们在我国土地上每前进一步都制造了对苏联工人和农民的骇人听闻的暴行。尤以美国掠夺者的暴行为甚。作为反苏武装干涉的积极组织者和煽动者的美帝国主义，对于俄罗斯人民和我国其他民族的人民说来，是最残暴的刽子手和宪兵。
    伟大的劳动人民的领袖列宁和斯大林把全国团结为一个统一的战斗的营垒，发动我国人民从事卫国战争。具有高度政治觉悟因而坚强有力的苏联军队，在劳动人民的大力支持下，粉碎了武装干涉者和白卫军，保卫了自己的社会主义国家的自由和独立，保卫了伟大的十月社会主义革命的成果。
    由于共产党和它的英明的领袖列宁和斯大林的领导，我国人民和他的军队赢得了这一胜利。在组织和领导保卫苏维埃国家的事业中，斯大林同志是列宁的主要助手，是最重要的军事战略计划的制定者、决定性战役的领导者，是在国内战争和外国武装干涉时期苏联军队获得重大胜利的直接鼓舞者和组织者。二
    国际帝国主义窒息和奴役苏维埃国家的第一次尝试破产了。但是帝国主义对我们祖国新的军事进攻的威胁并没有消除。因此就必须以全力巩固苏维埃国家的经济的和国防的力量。列宁—斯大林的党从未忘记这一点，它不倦地使我国的军队经常有积极防御的准备。党顺利地实现了列宁—斯大林的国家工业化和农业集体化的政策，使苏联成为一个拥有社会主义工业和集体化农业的强大的国家。由于社会主义工业的增长和它的技术方面的完善，苏联军队的所有兵种都获得了头等的装备。我们的军队已成为机械化和摩托化的军队，已成为拥有受过斯大林的军事科学基础教育的、优秀的指挥员干部的军队。
    对积极防御的准备并不局限于创造各种物质条件，这种物质条件在战争的形势下，能够保证迅速组织军事生产并源源不绝地供给军队和人民以粮食，供给工业以原料。列宁—斯大林的党在政治方面也同时使国家和军队进行积极防御的准备。在斯大林同志的英明的领导下，党粉碎了托洛茨基—布哈林分子隐藏在地下的老巢穴，因此得以及时消灭了在苏联出现“第五纵队”的任何可能。马林科夫同志在党的第十九次代表大会上说：“不难了解，假使我们没有及时地做好这一工作，我们在战争期间就会陷于腹背受敌的境地，我们就可能在战争中失败。”
    在消灭了剥削阶级和在社会主义胜利的基础上，大大发展了苏联人民道义上和政治上的一致性，发展了苏联各族人民的友谊和苏维埃的爱国主义，这是苏联力量所以强大的保证。苏联强大的力量鲜明地表现在伟大的卫国战争中。这次战争是我们祖国所经历的一切战争中最艰苦的一次战争。这次战争，涉及到苏联国家和苏联各族人民的生死存亡的问题。
    在美帝国主义怂恿下的德国法西斯侵略者，在一九四一年六月背信弃义地突然向苏联进攻，它们的目的是想消灭我们社会主义祖国，奴役苏联人民。苏联各族人民在死亡的威胁面前，更加紧密地团结在共产党、团结在伟大的领袖斯大林同志的周围。苏联的前方后方融为一体。共产党把人民和军队的全部力量转向唯一的目标——击溃敌人。党向苏联人民说明战争的意义和目的，教育人们热爱祖国，加强他们的战斗精神，使他们养成无畏的和守纪律的习惯。
    在天才的统帅斯大林的鼓舞和领导下，苏联军队以最伟大的坚忍性、勇敢和自我牺牲精神，与德国法西斯匪帮作战。在使敌人惫困不堪和大量牺牲以后，苏联军队从积极防御转为反攻，并表现了无与伦比的军事艺术的范例。它在与以美英两国亿万富翁的金钱所建立起来的庞大希特勒军事机构单独作战中所赢得的胜利，是永垂不朽的。
    苏军击溃了莫斯科近郊的德国法西斯军队，粉碎了敌人包围和占领我国首都的企图，埋葬了“闪电战”计划。伟大的斯大林格勒战役以包围、歼灭和俘虏敌人三十三万精锐部队而结束，并奠定了第二次世界大战根本转折的开端。在高加索山麓击溃希特勒匪军，粉碎了他们突破我国石油区域和牵制我国在南方的主要的后备军事力量的计划。库尔斯克战役结束了敌人的战略进攻。一九四四年十次斯大林式的毁灭性的打击，保证了军事行动转移至我们祖国以外，并引起希特勒集团的全面崩溃。
    一九四五年我们所获得的胜利，在东普鲁士、维斯杜拉河和奥德河畔，在布达佩斯和维也纳近郊，以及最后的攻克柏林等光辉战役，都是我国伟大的卫国战争史册中最鲜明的几页。
    希特勒匪徒的大洋彼岸的以及其他的庇护者们，尽力拖延欧洲第二战场的开辟，并背着苏联与德国法西斯分子进行单独媾和的谈判，他们的支持并未挽救了希特勒匪帮的可耻命运。
    伟大的卫国战争以我国战胜法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的具有全世界历史意义的胜利而结束。
    苏联各族人民以自己的老大哥——伟大的俄罗斯民族为首，支援了苏联陆海军的战斗。斯大林同志把苏联人民在后方的忘我劳动，工人阶级、集体农庄农民和我国知识分子在伟大的卫国战争中的劳绩，评价为保卫祖国的无比的丰功伟绩。
    苏联粉碎了希特勒德国和帝国主义的日本，给予世界反动派以歼灭性的打击，促进了全世界民主和社会主义力量的增长。苏联人民、我们的光荣的共产党荣誉地完成了自己对各国劳动者的国际主义的职责。国外的各兄弟政党赞扬我党的英勇和成就，给我党以世界革命和工人运动的“突击队”的称号。斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上说道：“他们以此表示希望这支‘突击队’的成功减轻在资本主义压迫下呻吟的各国人民的痛苦。我认为，我们党并没有辜负这种希望，特别是在第二次世界大战时期，苏联粉碎了德国和日本的法西斯暴政，使欧洲和亚洲的各国人民解脱了法西斯奴役的威胁。”
    在伟大卫国战争中所获得的胜利，是我们苏维埃国家和社会制度的胜利，是我国武装力量的胜利。
    苏联人民及其武装力量所得到的胜利，应当归功于我们的领袖和导师、苏维埃国家的英明领导者和天才统帅斯大林同志。最高统帅斯大林同志曾制订并实现了粉碎敌人的计划，动员了苏维埃社会主义国家全部的物质的和精神的力量以达到胜利。因此，我们祖国在战争中克服了任何一个资产阶级国家所经受不住的困难。斯大林的军事科学在战场上表现出较之资产阶级军事科学的充分优越性。
    国际帝国主义分子所制造的第二次世界大战，导致了他们所不曾预料到的结果。他们曾企图毁灭、或者至少要削弱苏联，窒息欧、亚两洲人民群众的解放运动。实际上得到的却完全是另外一种结果。
    苏联在战后更加强大了。它的国际威信也空前地增长起来。由于我们的胜利，世界帝国主义被进一步削弱了，民主和社会主义力量则更加巩固和增长了。中欧和东南欧的许多国家脱离了资本主义体系，并奠定了人民民主制度。伟大的中国人民成立了自由的人民共和国，获得了具有历史意义的胜利。在欧洲中部成立了德意志民主共和国。现在全人类已有三分之一挣脱了帝国主义的压迫。以苏联为首的团结一致的强大无敌的社会主义阵营正在日益壮大并取得新的巨大成就。
    被内部矛盾所分裂着的、以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营，因其经常增长着的矛盾而动摇着，在挑起新的世界战争方面来寻找出路。美帝国主义者纠合了国际反动派，进行着反对朝鲜人民的强盗的侵略战争，结成各种侵略集团，重新武装西德和日本。美帝国主义者及其帮凶在朝鲜进行血腥的战争。他们臆造出争取世界霸权的各种计划，准备进攻苏联和人民民主国家。美帝国主义加紧向社会主义阵营各国派遣间谍、破坏分子和暗杀分子，就是它这些最凶恶的计划的一个组成部分。
    苏联人民和在战前一样，努力于和平建设事业。他们为列宁、斯大林的党所鼓舞和领导着，提前完成了工业生产部分的第四个五年计划，在工业、运输、农业方面达到了新的有力的高涨，劳动人民的文化和物质福利有了进一步的提高。
    一九五一年和一九五二年，即第五个斯大林五年计划的头两年的任务也已超额完成，因而为提前完成整个五年计划创造了良好的条件。这个五年计划是苏联由社会主义向共产主义发展道路上前进的、新的一大步，它将更加巩固我们祖国积极防御力量的经济基础。
    共产党认为自己的最重要任务之一是“竭力加强苏维埃祖国的积极防御，以防止敌人的侵略行动。”我党这个崇高的任务是符合全体苏联人的愿望的，他们为了加强社会主义祖国的国防威力，为了提高苏联武装力量的战斗准备，是不惜一切的。
    苏联人民永远记着列宁和斯大林的这一警告：当帝国主义国家还存在的时候，当资本主义的包围还存在的时候，帝国主义强盗武装攻击我们祖国的危险，也依然存在。
    时时刻刻不要忘记，我们的成就愈大，帝国主义者的活动便愈狡猾，他们将想尽一切方法来阻碍我们前进。我国的带有资产阶级观点和资产阶级道德的人，苏维埃人民的暗藏的敌人，在他们的支持下行动。这些毒虫企图尽量厉害地咬我们，一群暗害的医生、美英帝国主义者的走狗，卑鄙的间谍和凶手事件的被揭发便证明了这一点。因此，对于我们队伍中的自安自慰和马马虎虎的任何一点表现，都要彻底肃清。
    我国人民记得资本主义的包围，不断加强着苏联的陆军和海军，提高着反对战争挑拨者及其代理人的阴谋诡计的警惕性。
    伟大的领袖和统帅斯大林同志，给苏军提出了一个重大而光荣的任务：“警惕地保护苏联人民的和平的建设性劳动，牢固地保卫苏联的国家利益并使我们祖国的边疆不受敌人侵犯。”
    苏联战士把光荣地执行斯大林同志的指示看做是自己的责任，时时为争取在战斗训练和政治修养方面的卓越成绩而奋斗。
    美帝国主义者及其代理人不惜采用恐吓手段。但是这吓不倒苏联。我国人民有与侵略者作战的巨大经验，我们对于打击敌人不是生手。苏联人民在共产党的领导之下，在国内战争时代就曾成功地击溃了敌人，在第二次世界大战期间也打击了敌人，只要敌人胆敢来扰乱我们的和平劳动，我们就会再击溃他们。
    苏联陆军部部长、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上说过：“苏军的战斗操练和作战训练的情况，及其动员准备和战斗准备，使我们有十足的资格对党、对政府、对斯大林同志本人提出保证：苏军必将光荣履行任务以保护苏联人民的建设性的劳动，以保卫苏联的国家利益。”
    苏维埃国家过去和现在一贯坚持奉行和平和各国人民合作的政策，我国人民不愿意战争。但是如果敌人把战争强加在我们头上，他们将受到惨痛的打击。
    马林科夫同志在第十九次党代表大会的报告中说道：“历史事实是不能置之不顾的。这些事实说明，第一次世界大战的结果，俄国脱离了资本主义体系，而第二次世界大战的结果，欧洲和亚洲却有一系列的国家脱离了资本主义体系。我们有一切根据来推断：第三次世界大战会引起世界资本主义体系的崩溃。”
    美国的战争挑拨者应该想想这个前途。
    在苏联军队存在的期间，企图把猪嘴伸到我们苏联菜园来的所有帝国主义强盗们，都曾碰得头破血流。如果任何侵略者胆敢再来侵犯我们的祖国，为苏联全体人民所支持的苏联军队，永远准备着给他们以毁灭性的打击。
