The Northeast Machinery Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building
Product Plans Repeatedly Changed, Resulting in Great Waste of Design Resources

The factory design plan tasks undertaken by the Northeast Machinery Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building in the past year and a half were not sufficiently sound, resulting in significant waste of design resources and state assets.

In the past year and a half, three-quarters of the design plan tasks undertaken by the bureau were discarded; half of the preliminary designs and technical designs were discarded or significantly modified due to changes in the design plan tasks. According to preliminary estimates, half of the design manpower was wasted. Taking Factory No. 11 as an example, the design plan task was changed four times drastically. The products went from light to heavy; the nature of production changed from multi-variety, small-batch production to single-variety, large-batch production. Each change caused rework and modifications in the design. The factory has been under construction for two years, designing and constructing simultaneously, modifying as it went, resulting in waste. The most recent change required re-collecting product data and technical operation data, bringing design work and equipment installation to a standstill; the built factory buildings and vacant land reserved for future construction were no longer suitable. A newly built foundry workshop needs to be expanded again this year due to the increased product weight, resulting in a less-than-ideal workshop. Because the design plan tasks changed frequently, not only was design manpower wasted, but construction was also delayed, causing some irreparable losses.

The reason why the bureau's design plan tasks were repeatedly changed is that, in addition to objective limitations and lack of experience, insufficient subjective effort is a very important reason. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

First, insufficient investigation and research. In the past, when determining product plans, there was a lack of sufficient investigation and research on the basis of actual needs. For example, the product types and quantities of Machinery Factory No. 2 and Factory No. 25 are still unknown to be correct. Carelessness in work and insufficient communication also caused great errors. For example, the design plan tasks of Factory No. 11 and Factory No. 1 had some overlap, which was not discovered in time.

Second, eagerness for quick results and great blindness. For example, when Factory No. 11 started planning, it decided to build it in one year without a good study of the design and construction forces, and the plan failed. Now it seems that it will take at least four years.

Third, insufficient understanding of the close relationship between product plans and factory design. Generally, it is believed that a product plan can be developed first, and then design can begin, and it does not matter if there are some changes in the future. It is not recognized that factory design, such as workshop division, factory building size, and equipment selection, must be determined according to the product plan. If the product changes, the design must be modified according to the degree of change, and construction will also be affected.

Fourth, the design department has a dependency mentality, believing that the design plan task is a matter for the planning department, and does not conduct detailed research, but rushes to design as soon as it receives the design plan task.

### 第一机械工业部东北机械局  产品方案屡次变更设计力量浪费很大

    第一机械工业部东北机械局
    产品方案屡次变更设计力量浪费很大
    中央第一机械工业部东北机械局过去一年半中做的工厂设计计划任务书不够确实，使设计力量和国家资财遭受了很大的浪费。
    该局过去一年半来所做的设计计划任务书，有四分之三作废；所做初步设计及技术设计因设计计划任务书变更，有半数作废或作了重大修改。据初步估计，有半数设计人力被浪费了。以十一厂为例，设计计划任务书曾大变四次。产品从轻型变到重型；生产性质从多品种小批生产变到单一品种大批生产。每次改变都引起设计的返工和修改。该厂施工已有二年，一面设计一面施工，边做边改，造成浪费。最近一次改变时，需要重新搜集产品资料和技术操作资料，使设计工作和设备安装工程陷于停顿；已建厂房和留作待建厂房的空地已不适用。一个刚盖好的铸工车间，因产品重量增加，今年要重新扩大建筑，变成一个不很合理的车间。因设计计划任务书多变，不但浪费设计力量，而且拖延施工，造成了一些不可挽救的损失。
    该局设计计划任务书所以屡次改变，除客观条件限制和经验不足外，主观努力不够是一个很重要的原因。这主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、调查研究做得不够。过去确定产品方案时，对实际需要量的根据缺乏足够的调查研究，如机械二厂和二十五厂的产品种类和数量，到现在还不知道是不是正确的。工作上粗枝大叶以及彼此联系不够，也曾造成很大错误。如十一厂的设计计划任务书和一厂的就有一部分重复，没有及时发现。
    二、急于求成，盲目性很大。如十一厂开始作计划时，没有很好地研究设计力量和施工力量就决定在一年内建好，结果计划落了空。现在看来，最快也要四年。
    三、对产品方案和工厂设计的密切联系认识不足。一般的都认为先搞一个产品方案，就可开始设计，将来再变一些也没有关系。没有认识到工厂设计，如车间划分、厂房大小、设备选择等，都要根据产品方案确定，如果产品一变，设计就要按照变的程度修改，施工也会受到影响。
    四、设计部门存在着依赖思想，认为设计计划任务书是计划部门的事，不加详细研究，拿到设计计划任务书就赶作设计。
