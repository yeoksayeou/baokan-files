A Heroic Unit of the Korean People's Army
Chen Weiren

A certain unit of the Korean People's Army is an outstanding heroic unit. They resolutely carried out the Supreme Commander General Kim Il-sung's Order No. 70, defended the 1211 Heights, which the enemy called "Heartbreak Ridge," and were awarded the glorious title of "Kang Kon Guards Division."

On October 20th of last year, I, as part of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Comfort, met Comrade Song Zhongxi, the deputy division commander of this unit, in a reconnaissance company of the Korean People's Army. Deputy Division Commander Song was one of the commanders who participated in the "Heartbreak Ridge" defensive battle, and he had also contributed to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Therefore, we all asked him to talk about the battle achievements of their unit.

Deputy Division Commander Song, of medium build and just over thirty years old, spoke fluent Chinese. In 1942, he joined the Chinese people's armed struggle against Japan and was active in the Binhai area of Shandong, China. In July 1949, he responded to the call of his motherland, returned to North Korea, and participated in peaceful construction. He only lived a year of peaceful life in his motherland, and from the day the Fatherland Liberation War began, he threw himself into battle again, fighting all the way from the 38th parallel to the Nakdong River.

When the American invading army landed at Incheon, this unit did not have time to fully retreat and remained behind enemy lines to continue fighting. At that time, they were in a very unfavorable situation, and it was common for them to go without food for several days. It was not until they participated in the second phase of the Fifth Campaign in May 1951 that they were ordered to withdraw. At that time, the unit fought and retreated, and the rear supply was difficult. The soldiers had nothing to eat and could only walk 20 to 30 li per day. However, they finally overcame all difficulties.

Not many days later, a new situation suddenly arose: enemy paratroopers landed in Inje, and another enemy force landed on the east coast. This posed a serious threat to the planned northward retreat of the People's Army. This division was ordered to carry out a blocking action in Wontong-ri. They persisted in a week of fierce fighting and finally achieved victory.

Since the Chinese People's Volunteers joined the battle and drove the enemy back to the 38th parallel together with the Korean People's Army, this unit has been fighting between Inje and Yanggu. From May to September 1951, they did not have a single day without fighting. On September 2nd, the unit had just arrived at the predetermined position, and before the soldiers could even get their footing, a fierce battle began again. This was the prelude to the famous "Heartbreak Ridge" defensive battle.

Their position was north of Yanggu, facing the enemy's Gachilbong position. The main position of the People's Army was Eagle Peak, which had very unfavorable terrain. The enemy fired more than 30,000 shells at the People's Army position every day, and an average of 30 enemy aircraft took turns bombing. The enemy at that time attempted to open a road to the north from here, wanting to use "military pressure" to push our army to the "waist" area on the "39th parallel."

The enemy's wish will never become a reality. Supreme Commander General Kim Il-sung's Order No. 70: It is necessary to firmly defend the original territory of the Republic and stabilize the front line. The soldiers made oaths one after another, and sent the oaths signed with their names to General Kim Il-sung to express their determination.

The fierce battle continued. This heroic unit of the Korean People's Army, with unparalleled tenacity and bravery, wrote a magnificent epic page in the history of the Fatherland Liberation War. The soldiers, relying on the cover of three artillery regiments, fought while building fortifications.

The nameless heights in front of the 1211 Heights were located between the People's Army position and the enemy's Gachilbong position, and therefore became the focus of contention between the two sides. This height was sometimes contested sixteen or seventeen times a day, changing hands several times. In September and October alone, it changed hands as many as sixty times. But this position remained in the hands of the People's Army, standing firm.

At that time, the units facing this unit were the Fifth and Third Divisions of the ROK army, and the Second and Seventh Divisions of the US Army also participated in the battle at Gachilbong. But after the initial battle, they suffered heavy losses and pushed the position to the ROK army. By the end of October, the Fifth and Third Divisions of the puppet army had been so badly beaten that they had lost their combat effectiveness. Tens of thousands of enemy corpses lay in front of this heroic position.

Deputy Division Commander Song said: "This battle not only stabilized our front line, but also strengthened the combat effectiveness of our unit. More importantly, we fully implemented General Kim Il-sung's order and faithfully fulfilled the solemn oath of the People's Army."

In this battle, the commanders and fighters of this heroic unit displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism, and there were many moving heroic deeds. Kim Myong-chol and Li Shoufu, members of the Korean Democratic Youth League, blocked the enemy's machine-gun fire with their bodies in order to seize the nameless heights, dedicating their precious lives to the motherland. They were awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and became shining examples of "Matrosov-style" heroes in the Korean People's Army. Under their influence, such heroes appeared one after another in the Korean People's Army units. In late September of last year, two such heroes appeared again in the battle of the People's Army to capture Heights 854.1 on the eastern front: Shen Ji-yong, a member of the Labor Party, and Park Won-jeong, a member of the Democratic Youth League.

They were not only brave but also resourceful. On one of the most intense nights of the battle, such an interesting thing happened: our army, with the cooperation of fierce artillery fire, captured the nameless heights. As soon as the artillery fire subsided, several enemy planes flew over the heights and urgently contacted the ground by telephone. Little did they know that the enemy's telephone and position had already changed hands. A battalion commander of the People's Army picked up the earpiece and only heard "wah wah wah" without understanding what was being said. The battalion commander thought: If I don't answer, the enemy plane might drop flares, and bombs would follow. So, he grabbed the telephone and shouted "Hello! Hello!" several times. The enemy thought it was still their own people, so they dumped more than a hundred bundles of barbed wire for building fortifications. These barbed wires even had ready-made stakes, so the soldiers unhesitatingly used these American barbed wires to build fortifications to defend against the attacks of the US and ROK armies.

While defending this nameless height, they had caused the enemy to lose nearly three divisions of troops without gaining anything. The soldiers of the ROK army gave this height the name "Heartbreak Ridge"; a mountain ditch in front of the position was filled with enemy corpses, and the enemy also gave it the name "Trap Ditch."

Due to the glorious victory in the "Heartbreak Ridge" defensive battle, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided to award this heroic unit of the Korean People's Army the glorious title of "Kang Kon Guards Division."

    朝鲜人民军的一支英雄部队
    陈维仁
    朝鲜人民军某部是一支出色的英雄部队，他们坚决执行了最高司令官金日成将军的第七十号命令，守住了被敌人称为“伤心岭”的一二一一高地，荣获“姜健近卫师”的光荣称号。
    去年十月二十日，我随中国人民赴朝慰问团的一部分代表，在朝鲜人民军的一个侦察连队里，会见了这个部队的副师长宋忠锡同志。宋副师长是参加
    “伤心岭”阻击战的指挥员之一，而且他曾为中国人民的解放事业贡献过力量。因此我们都要求他谈谈他们部队的战斗事迹。
    宋副师长，中等身材，年龄才不过三十刚过，说得一口流利的中国话。他在一九四二年就参加了中国人民的抗日武装斗争，活跃在中国的山东滨海地区。一九四九年七月里，他响应祖国的召唤，回到朝鲜，参加和平建设。他在祖国仅仅只过了一年的和平生活，从祖国解放战争开始的那一天起，他又投入了战斗，一直从“三八线”打过洛东江。
    美国侵略军在仁川登陆时，这个部队没有来得及完全后撤，就留在敌人的后方坚持战斗。当时，他们处在十分不利的情况下，几天吃不上饭是常事。直到一九五一年五月参加了第五次战役第二阶段的战斗之后，他们才奉命撤回来。当时部队且战且走，后方供应困难，战士们没有吃的，每天只能走二、三十里路。但是，终于战胜了一切的困难。
    不几天，突然又发生了新的情况：敌人的伞兵在麟蹄降落，另部敌人由东海岸登陆。这对于人民军有计划地北撤的部队，是一个严重的威胁。这个师团就奉令在元通里实行阻击。他们坚持了一星期的激烈战斗，终于获得了胜利。
    自中国人民志愿军参加作战，和朝鲜人民军一起把敌人赶回“三八线”后，这支部队一直在麟蹄、杨口之间作战。一九五一年五月到九月，他们没有过一天不打仗的日子。九月二日，部队刚刚到达预定的阵地，战士们还没有站住脚，猛烈的战斗又开始了。这就是著名的“伤心岭”阻击战的序幕。
    他们的阵地在杨口以北，和敌人的加七峰阵地对峙着。人民军的主阵地是鹰峰山，地形很不利。敌人每天向人民军的阵地发炮三万余发，平均每天三十架敌机轮番滥炸。敌人当时企图从这里打开北进的道路，想用“军事压力”把我军压到“三九线”上的“蜂腰”地带。
    敌人的妄想是永远也不会变成事实的。最高司令官金日成将军第七十号命令：必须坚守共和国原有的土地，把战线稳定下来。战士们纷纷宣誓，并且把签上他们的名字的宣誓文，寄给金日成将军表示决心。
    激烈的战斗继续着。朝鲜人民军的这个英雄部队，以无比的顽强和勇敢，写下了祖国解放战争史上的一页壮丽的史诗。战士们依靠着三个炮团的掩护，
    一面战斗，一面构筑工事。
    一二一一高地前面的无名高地，正处在人民军阵地和敌人的加七峰阵地之间，因此成为双方争夺的焦点。这个高地有时每天争夺十六、七次，要易手数次，仅仅在九、十两个月中，就反复易手达六十次之多。但这个阵地依然在人民军手中，屹立不动。
    在当时和这个部队交手的是李伪军五师、三师，美军第二师和美军第七师也在加七峰参加战斗。但在初战之后就遭受了惨重的损失，把阵地推给了李伪军。到十月底，伪五师和伪三师已经被打得失去了战斗力。数万具敌人的尸体躺在这个英雄阵地的前面。
    宋副师长说：“这次战役不仅使我们的战线稳定了下来，而且还锻炼了我们部队的战斗力。更重要的是完满地执行了金日成将军的命令，忠实地履行了人民军队庄严的誓言。”
    在这次战斗中，这支英雄部队的指挥员和战斗员，发挥了高度的革命英雄主义，出现了可歌可泣的英雄事迹。朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员金明哲、李寿福等为了夺取无名高地，曾以自己的身体堵住敌人的机枪火口，把宝贵的生命献给了祖国，荣获“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”称号，成为朝鲜人民军中“马特洛索夫式”英雄的光辉榜样。在他们的影响之下，这样的英雄，接二连三地在朝鲜人民军部队中出现。去年九月下旬，人民军某部在东线攻取八五四·一高地的战斗中，又出现了这样的两位英雄：劳动党员沈基?和民青盟员朴元政。
    他们不仅英勇而且机智。在战斗最激烈的一个夜晚，曾发生这样一件有趣的事：我军在猛烈的炮火配合之下，攻取了无名高地，炮火刚刚沉寂下来，几架敌机就飞到了高地上空，用电话急促地和地面联络。那知敌人的电话机和阵地一起都已经换了主人，人民军一位营长拿起耳机，只听见“哇啦哇啦”地不知说的啥。这位营长想：要是不回答敌机就可能挂照明弹，炸弹也会跟着下来。于是，他就抓起电话机“哈囉！哈囉！”喊了几声，敌人以为还是自己人，就一古脑地把一百多捆筑工事用的铁丝网丢了下来。这些铁丝网连椿子都是现成的，于是战士们就毫不迟疑地把这些美国铁丝网，拿来筑工事，以防备美军和李伪军的进攻。
    他们在守卫这个无名高地时，曾经使敌人丧失了近三个师的兵力而毫无所获。李伪军的兵士们，就给这个高地取个名字叫做“伤心岭”；阵前的一道山沟填满了敌人的尸首，敌人也给它取个名字叫做
    “陷阱沟”。
    朝鲜人民军的这支英雄部队，由于在“伤心岭”阻击战中获得了光辉的胜利，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会决议，授予他们以“姜健近卫师”的光荣称号。
