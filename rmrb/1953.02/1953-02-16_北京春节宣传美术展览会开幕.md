The Beijing Spring Festival Propaganda Art Exhibition, prepared by the Art Group of the Capital's 1953 Spring Festival Literary and Art Propaganda Work Committee, has collected over a hundred New Year pictures, comic strips, and other artworks related to the Resist-America, Aid-Korea campaign, national construction, and the implementation of the Marriage Law movement from the past three years. These works are relatively refined original creations by Beijing artists in recent years. In addition, there are works by amateur artists. The exhibition is open to the public from February 14th to February 28th (the first to fifteenth days of the Lunar New Year) at Yilantang and Daoningzhai in Beihai Park.
The committee has also carefully selected over seventy types of New Year pictures for exhibition at the Labor People's Cultural Palace.
