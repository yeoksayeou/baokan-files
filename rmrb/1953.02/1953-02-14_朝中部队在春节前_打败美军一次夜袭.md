Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th: The American aggressor army suffered another defeat on the Western Front before the 1953 Spring Festival. The American aggressor army has rarely dared to fight at night, but this time they made an exception and launched a night attack. They may have thought that they could take advantage of the darkness to launch a surprise night attack, but they were met with a head-on blow.

On the night of the 7th, at around 11:00 PM, a company of the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division stealthily approached our army's position on the south mountain of Dongbian Village, southeast of Panmunjom. One of the platoons advanced to 30 meters from our position without encountering any resistance. Thus, these night raid bandits boldly crawled closer by 10 meters. Just as the enemy stood up to charge, our soldiers on the position, who had been quietly waiting for the enemy to arrive, suddenly stood up and bombarded them fiercely with submachine guns and hand grenades, immediately driving the enemy back. Afterwards, the enemy launched two more attacks, but were repulsed by our soldiers who firmly defended the position. This battle was the largest in the past five days, lasting three hours. Our army eliminated more than 60 enemies and captured one light and one heavy machine gun, and five various guns.

On the Western and Central Fronts, only small units of the enemy and our side came into contact. On the Eastern Front, the enemy suffered repeated blows from our army's night raid teams. In these five days alone, our army eliminated more than 120 enemies through methods such as raids and ambushes. In two ambush battles south of Gao Cheng and south of Chang Cheng-ri, more than 50 Li puppet soldiers were eliminated.

In the five days from February 6th to 10th, our army's front-line mobile artillery fire killed or wounded a total of 368 enemy soldiers; front-line anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down 11 enemy planes and damaged 21 enemy planes.

    朝中部队在春节前
    打败美军一次夜袭
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】一九五三年春节之前，美国侵略军在西线又吃了一个败仗。美国侵略军向来是很少敢在夜间作战的，这一次却例外地进行了一次夜间袭击，他们也许以为乘黑夜的庇护进行突然的夜袭可以占点便宜，但是，他们换到的却是迎头一棒。
    七日夜十一时许，美海军陆战队第一师一个连偷偷地向板门店东南的东便村南山我军的阵地接近。其中的一个排进到距我阵地三十公尺的地方，还未遇到抵抗，于是这群夜袭匪徒们又大胆地爬近了十公尺。正当敌人站起来要冲锋的时候，我军阵地上沉静地伺候着敌人前来的战士们便突然站立起来，用冲锋枪、手榴弹猛烈地轰射起来，一下子就把敌人打了下去。以后，敌人又进行了两次攻击，都被我严守阵地的战士击溃。这次战斗是近五天来最大的一次战斗，历经三小时；我军共歼敌六十多名，并缴获轻重机枪各一挺，各种枪五枝。
    在西线和中线，敌我双方只有小部队接触。东线的敌人屡遭我军夜袭队的打击，仅在这五天中我军就用袭击、伏击等方法共歼敌一百二十多名。高城以南和长承里以南的两次伏击战中歼灭李伪军五十多名。
    自二月六日至十日的五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军三百六十八名；前线高射炮火击落敌机十一架，击伤敌机二十一架。
