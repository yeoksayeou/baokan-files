    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th—The All-India Peace Council held a public rally in Delhi on the 14th to oppose US President Eisenhower's policy of expanding the war of aggression in the Far East and to demand an immediate cessation of the Korean War. Six hundred Delhi citizens participated in the rally. Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Kumalappa, presided over the meeting.
    Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and Madras film director K. Subramanyam spoke at the meeting, calling for mass demonstrations to support the demand for an immediate armistice in Korea. He said: The people of India can exert a positive influence for peace. Member of Parliament and former Chief Minister of the Baopal State Government, Chatur Narain Malaviya, also expressed support at the meeting for the demand for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, and said: I believe that American imperialists have engaged in bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. They are now plotting to have Asians fight Asians. But they will be utterly defeated.
    Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and writer Guo Baike said: The Indian people should unite with world public opinion in opposing Eisenhower's warmongering rhetoric. Guo Baike pointed out: MacArthur and Eisenhower or Wall Street may think they can expand the Korean War to China, but they are wrong. The Chinese people cannot be defeated.
    Indian Member of Parliament and famous poet Harindranath Chattopadhyaya also spoke at the meeting, advocating that India should stand with China to safeguard peace.
    The assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea and condemning Eisenhower's policy of expanding the Korean War. In another resolution, the assembly endorsed the "Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers" adopted by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress.
    [Xinhua News Agency] A commentator from the Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 17th entitled "The American Imperialists' Plot to Use Asians to Fight Asians Will Inevitably Fail," exposing Eisenhower's declaration to use the Chiang Kai-shek remnants to expand the war of aggression in the Far East. The commentary said: Eisenhower's statement is the American plan to use Asians to fight Asians. Because of the heavy failures it has suffered in Korea, and the many difficulties it has encountered, especially difficulties regarding combat troops, the American aggressors have been forced to resort to this method.
    The commentary looked back at the fact that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang was driven out of mainland China a few years ago, that American imperialism and its client states suffered heavy defeats in Korea, and that French colonialists, although receiving increasing aid from the United States, were also defeated in Vietnam. The commentary concluded: Judging from the lessons of China, Korea, and Vietnam, it can be predicted that in the face of the united struggle of the Asian and world people, the American imperialists' plot to use Asians to fight Asians will ultimately fail.

    越南通讯社指出美国利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋终将失败
    【新华社新德里十八日电】　全印和平理事会十四日在德里召开公众集会，反对美国总统艾森豪威尔的扩大远东侵略战争政策，要求立即停止朝鲜战争。参加集会的有德里市民六百人。全印和平理事会副主席库马拉帕担任大会主席。
    全印和平理事会副主席、马德拉斯电影导演克·苏布拉曼雅姆在会上发言，号召举行群众示威来支持关于立即在朝鲜停战的要求。他说：印度人民能产生有利于和平的影响。国会议员、前波保尔邦政府首席部长查图尔·纳拉茵·马拉维亚也在会上表示支持立即在朝鲜停火的要求，并说：我相信，美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国进行过细菌战。他们现在阴谋使亚洲人打亚洲人。但他们将遭到彻底的失败。
    全印和平理事会副主席、作家郭白克说：印度人民应和世界舆论一致反对艾森豪威尔的好战言论。郭白克指出：麦克阿瑟和艾森豪威尔或华尔街可能以为他们能够把朝鲜战争扩大到中国，但他们错了。中国人民是打不败的。
    印度国会议员、著名诗人哈林德拉纳特·查托巴达雅也在会上发言，主张印度应和中国站在一边维护和平。
    大会一致通过决议，要求立即在朝鲜停火，并斥责艾森豪威尔的扩大朝鲜战争政策。大会在另一项决议中赞同维也纳世界人民和平大会所通过的“致五大国政府书”。
    【新华社讯】　越南通讯社评论员十七日发表题为“美帝国主义利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋必将失败”的评论，揭露艾森豪威尔声明利用蒋介石残匪扩大远东侵略战争的阴谋。评论说：艾森豪威尔的声明就是美国利用亚洲人打亚洲人的计划。美国侵略者由于在朝鲜遭到惨重的失败，遇到许多困难，尤其是在作战部队方面的困难，因而被迫求助于这一办法。
    评论回溯蒋介石匪帮几年前被赶出中国大陆、美帝国主义和它的仆从国在朝鲜遭到惨重的失败以及法国殖民者虽然从美国得到日益增加的援助也在越南被打败的事实。评论最后说：从中国、朝鲜和越南的教训看来，可以预料，在亚洲和世界人民联合斗争面前，美帝国主义利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋终将失败。
