The reconstruction project of the Yangquan to Taiyuan section of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway (the railway line from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan) was successfully completed on December 30th of last year, thanks to the efforts of all the staff participating in the project over a year and five months. The rebuilt new line can not only accommodate large passenger cars, but also increases transport capacity by 101 percent, creating more convenient conditions for the exchange of goods between Shanxi Province and other parts of the country.

The successful completion of the reconstruction project of the Yangquan-Taiyuan section of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway once again demonstrates the superiority of the New Democratic social system. Before liberation, the feudal rulers, in order to maintain their feudal separatist rule and facilitate their control over the people of Shanxi, used the blood and sweat of the people of Shanxi to build the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway as a narrow-gauge railway. During the Japanese occupation, although the narrow gauge was converted to a wide gauge in order to plunder the people of Shanxi, the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway was still winding, with steep gradients and curves as small as 100 meters and gradients as steep as 22 per thousand. The mountain tunnels through which the train passed were also small and narrow, so large locomotives could not pass, greatly limiting transportation capacity. In 1949, the People's Government corrected the alignment of the Shijiazhuang to Yangquan section. In order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, the reconstruction project of the Yangquan to Taiyuan section was started in July 1951.

This reconstruction project was very large. Curves had to be straightened, gradients had to be reduced, bridges had to be built over water, and mountains had to be opened and tunnels dug. The entire project involved as many as 303 bridges, 13 tunnels, and 24 embankments and retaining walls, requiring 1.09 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. The tracks of all 17 stations along the section had to be lengthened, and the station facilities had to be rebuilt. In order to make the most of the old line and save the state's funds, the intersection and overlap of the new and old lines occurred as many as 156 times, creating great difficulties for construction. The reconstruction project also had to be carried out while traffic was maintained. Blasting and opening mountains on cliffs was done while trains continued to run below. The reconstruction project started at the end of summer and continued until winter, requiring both fighting floods and battling ice. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the guidance of Soviet experts, all the staff participating in the reconstruction project demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and finally overcame these difficulties, completed the reconstruction project on schedule, ensured that the quality of the project met standards, and saved the state 24.5 billion yuan in funds.

Many facts in the reconstruction project fully demonstrate that in order to make the project "faster, better, more economical, and safer," there must be a clear guiding ideology and correct design. The reconstruction project resolutely followed the Ministry of Railways' reconstruction plan, proposing the principle of "improving the line as much as possible and improving the quality of transport capacity on the basis of utilizing the old line," and carried out route surveying and design work and construction preparation. In the design, senior leaders and Soviet expert Comrade Tikhonov strictly criticized the conservative thinking in the design work that favored the construction of steel beam bridges and the habit of using cement, learned from the Soviet Union's advanced arch bridge theory and construction methods, and established the principle of using local materials to "build stone bridges and stone tunnels." In this way, not only did the quality of the project achieve a permanent effect, but also saved the country a large amount of wealth. The seven larger stone arch bridges alone saved 1.12 billion yuan compared to cement bridges. Engineer Gao Wenqing repeatedly and carefully selected and measured the route, reducing the length of the tunnel by 110 meters compared to the original plan, saving the country 2.2 billion yuan.

In the reconstruction project, the widespread promotion of advanced experience not only improved work efficiency and accelerated the pace of the project, but also saved a large amount of wealth. For example, the Soviet Union's advanced concrete water-cement ratio method was promoted in 42 major projects, giving full play to the effectiveness of cement and ensuring the quality of the project. The advanced method of clay mortar was promoted in 20,000 cubic meters of projects such as wing walls and retaining walls, saving 10,000 bags of cement, and the compressive and arching force of the project increased by 17 percent.

Due to the high level of labor enthusiasm displayed by the broad masses of workers, new records, new inventions and creations, and a large number of rationalization proposals were constantly emerging in the progress of the project. For example, the original plan to build a 10-meter stone arch ring required 38 people to complete it in seven days. Through the efforts of the workers, it was gradually increased to four days and two days, and finally a new record of thirteen hours was created. In housing construction, the workers created a "seam hook" for pressure grouting, which increased work efficiency sevenfold. Due to the adoption of a suggestion from a temporary worker, standard sand from a nearby river was used, saving the country 50 million yuan. At the same time, due to reliance on the worker masses, a large number of activists were also cultivated, and 250 cadres were promoted from among the workers, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient cadres.

Also reported: In 1951, the former Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau organized a route selection committee for the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, relying on the masses along the line, and repeatedly surveyed the route between Chengdu and Lueyang surveyed in 1950, avoiding several difficult projects and errors in the original survey line, and saving the country 1.2 trillion yuan in engineering construction costs.

In 1950, when surveying the Chengdu to Lueyang section of the Tiancheng Railway, the time was rushed, there was a lack of experience, and the survey was based on old topographic maps, and the measurements were very sloppy. Later, after research by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau, it was believed that this project was too difficult. In April 1951, the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau organized a route selection committee for the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, led by engineers Guo Yi and Lan Tian, to undertake the route selection work. The route selection committee for the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway first based itself on the original line, combined with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and studied and determined which places should be measured in the field and which places should be compared. It started field work in September and lasted for 104 days, completing the route selection task.

Every time the route selection committee for the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway arrived at a place, they visited the local masses and listened to their opinions on the reconstruction, so they found many routes that could not be found on the map. For example, the geology in the Shiting River area is not good, and the river channel changes uncertainly. The local people all say: "The Shiting River is a mess." The original line was to build a bridge near Xiaohan County in Guanghan County, which would cross the four rivers of the Shiting River, with a bridge length of 500 to 600 meters, and the project was too large. The route selection committee visited many farmers, and finally a boatman led everyone to Sifangbei, more than ten miles away from Xiaohan County, and found a bridge site. This bridge only needs to cross one river, and the length of the bridge is shortened by more than 300 meters compared to the original site. For another example, the Pomiaozi Tunnel planned in the original line was 850 meters long and the project was difficult. The route selection committee solicited the opinions of the local masses, who suggested changing the route from Caoshuifangji, which not only avoided the tunnel project, but also shortened the route.

The route selection committee also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. When selecting the route, it not only considered the size of the construction cost, but also paid attention to the size of the operating expenses after the railway was built. For example, the original line from Baolun Temple in Zhaohua County to Xiaxiba in Guangyuan County crossed the Baishui River at the intersection of the Qingjiang River and the Baishui River, and went along the river to the earth base dam where the Baishui River and the Jialing River meet, and then went north along the right bank of the Jialing River to Xiaxiba, with a total length of 25 kilometers, and a special large Baishui River bridge 500 meters long was required. According to the ratio of 1.3 to 1 between the Soviet railway line and the aviation distance line (straight-line distance), the ratio of this line to the aviation distance line is close to 2 to 1. Therefore, the route selection committee believes that this line is too curved. Later, another bridge site was found at Guojia Ferry in the upper reaches of the Baishui River. This bridge site only needs to erect a 300-meter-long bridge, and the route can also be shortened by more than 6,200 meters. However, this new line has a tunnel project, and the project cost is 10 billion yuan more expensive than the original line. The route selection committee considered that although the construction cost of the new line was expensive, the distance was shortened, and the operating expenses could be greatly saved in the future. Therefore, it finally reported to the higher authorities for approval and abandoned the original route.

The route selected by the route selection committee for the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, which is the route currently under construction, compared with the route surveyed in 1950, has avoided and lowered a total of 7 bridges with a height of 65 meters and a total length of 1,471 meters, saving more than 3,000 tons of steel beam and steel frame materials, reducing 3,600 meters of high-altitude viaducts in valleys, and lowering 90 kilometers of cliff routes that are as high as 90 meters above the ground, and can reduce 5.8 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and 935,023 cubic meters of earth retaining wall project in the Mianyang to Lueyang section, shortening the route by 31 kilometers, and avoiding two large tunnels of more than one kilometer. The savings value is approximately 1.2 trillion yuan.

    石太线阳泉至太原段改线工程胜利完工
    天成路南段依靠群众改正线路避免遭受万余亿元的损失
    石太线（石家庄到太原的铁路线）阳泉至太原段的改线工程，经过参加改线工程全体职工一年零五个月的努力，已于去年十二月三十日胜利完工。改修后的新线不仅能够行驶大型客车，而且使运输能力增加了百分之一百零一，给山西省与全国各地的物资交流创造了更便利的条件。
    石太线阳太段改线工程的胜利完成，又一次表明了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。在解放以前，封建统治者为了维护他们的封建割据，便于他们统治山西人民，用山西人民的血汗，专门把石太线筑成窄轨铁路；日寇统治期间为了掠夺山西人民，虽然把窄轨改成了宽轨，但石太线还是弯弯曲曲，坡度很大，曲线小至一百公尺，坡度大至千分之二十二，火车通过的山洞又小又窄，因此大型机车不能通过，大大限制了运输能力。一九四九年人民政府即把石家庄至阳泉的一段改正线路。为了适应大规模经济建设的需要，一九五一年七月又开始进行阳泉至太原这一段的改线工程。
    这个改线工程是很大的。曲线要取直，坡度要缩小，遇水就得搭桥，遇山就得开山打洞。全部工程中的桥梁多至三百零三座，山洞多至十三孔，堤岸御土墙多至二十四座，需修土石方一百零九万公方。全段十七个车站的股道都得延长，站场的设备又得重修。为了尽量利用旧线，为国家节省资金，所以新旧线交接与交错多至一百五十六处，造成施工的很大困难。而改线工程还要在一面通车一面施工的情况下进行，悬崖上放炮开山，下面列车照常行驶。改线工程从夏季末尾开始直到冬季，既要与洪水搏战，又要与冰凌作斗争。但是，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在苏联专家的指导下，参加改线工程的全体职工发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，终于克服了这些困难，按期完成了改线工程，做到了工程质量合乎标准，并且给国家节省了二百四十五亿元的资金。
    改线工程中的许多事实，充分说明了要使工程做到“又快、又好、又省、又安全”，必须有明确的指导思想和进行正确的设计。改线工程是坚决遵循了中央铁道部的改线方案，提出“在利用旧线的基础上，尽量改善线路，提高质量运量”的原则，进行定线测量与设计工作及施工准备。在设计中上级领导与苏联专家齐赫诺夫同志严格地批判了设计工作中喜欢修钢梁桥，习惯用水泥的保守思想，学习了苏联先进的拱桥理论与修筑方法，确立了就地取材“修石桥建石洞”的方针。这样，不仅使工程质量达到了一劳永逸的效果，并且给国家节省了大批的财富，单七座较大的石拱桥就比水泥桥节省了十一亿二千万元。工程师高文清反复审慎地选线测量，较原计划少做了一百一十公尺长的隧道，给国家节省了二十二亿元。
    在改线工程中，广泛地推行了先进经验，不仅提高了工作效率，加快了工程速度，而且节省了大批财富。如在四十二处主要工程中推行了苏联的混凝土水灰比先进方法，充分发挥了水泥的效能，保证了工程质量。在翼墙、御土墙等二万立方公尺的工程中推广了胶泥沙浆的先进方法，节省了一万袋水泥，工程的耐压力与拱力反而提高了百分之十七。
    由于广大职工发挥了高度的劳动热情，工程进展中不断的出现新纪录、新的发明创造与大批的合理化建议。如垒砌一孔十公尺的石拱圈，原计划三十八个人七天完成，经工人的努力逐渐提高到四天、两天，最后创造了十三小时的新纪录。在房屋建筑中，职工们创造了压浆抅缝法的“抅缝器”，工作效率提高了七倍，由于采纳了一个临时工的建议，采用了附近河中的标准沙，给国家节省了五千万元。同时，由于依靠了工人群众，也培养出大批的积极分子，从工人中提拔了二百五十名干部，克服了干部不足的困难。
    又讯：一九五一年，原西南铁路工程局曾组织天成路南段选线委员会，依靠沿线群众，反复勘测了一九五零年踏勘的成都至略阳间的线路，避免了原测线中的若干艰巨工程和错误，为国家节省工程建筑费一万二千亿元。
    一九五零年踏勘天成铁路成都至略阳段时，时间仓促，缺乏经验，而且根据的是旧有地形图，测量得很马虎。后来经过中央人民政府铁道部及西南铁路工程局研究，都认为这一工程过于艰巨。一九五一年四月，西南铁路工程局由工程师郭彝、蓝田等组织天成路南段选线委员会，担负选线工作。天成路南段选线委员会首先根据原线，结合苏联先进经验，研究确定那些地方应实地测量，那些地方应做比较线，从九月起到野外工作，历时一百零四天，完成选线任务。
    天成路南段选线委员会每到一地，就访问当地群众，听取他们对改线的意见，因此找到了许多地图上找不到的线路。如石亭江一带地质不好，河道变迁无定，当地群众都说：“石亭江，稀巴烂”，而原线在广汉县小汉县附近搭桥，就要跨过石亭江的四股河水，桥长达五、六百公尺，工程太大。选线委员会访问了许多农民，最后由一个船夫带大家到距小汉县十余里的四方碑地方，找到了一个桥址。这座桥只需过一道河，桥的长度较原址缩短三百余公尺。又如原线中计划的破庙子隧道，全长达八百五十公尺，工程艰巨。选线委员会征求当地群众的意见，群众就提出改由漕水房基走，不但避免了隧道工程，而且缩短了线路。
    选线委员会又学习苏联先进经验，在选择线路时，不仅考虑建筑费用的大小，而且注意铁路筑成后经营上的开支大小。如昭化县宝轮院到广元县下西坝一段，原线是从清江和白水河交岔处过白水河，沿河边到白水河和嘉陵江会合处的土基坝，再向北沿嘉陵江右岸到下西坝，全长二十五公里，需做五百公尺长的特大的白水河桥。根据苏联铁路线与航空距离线（直线距离）一点三与一之比来考察此线，这条线路与航空距离线的比例已近二比一，因之，选线委员会认为这条线过于弯曲。后来，另在白水河上游郭家渡处找到一个桥址，这一桥址只需架三百公尺长的桥梁，线路也可缩短六千二百余公尺，但这条新线却有隧道工程一处，工程费较原线贵一百亿元。选线委员会考虑到新线建筑费虽贵，而距离却缩短了，日后营业开支可大为节省，因此，终于报请上级批准，放弃了原来的线路。
    天成路南段选线委员会所选择的，也就是目前正在施工的线路，和一九五零年踏勘的线路相较，总计共避免和降低了高六十五公尺，共一千四百七十一公尺长的桥梁七座，节省了钢梁钢架材料三千余吨，减少了山谷高架桥三千六百公尺，降低了离开地平面高达九十余公尺的悬岩路线九十余公里，并可减少五百八十万公方的土石方工程，及绵阳至略阳段御土墙工程九十三万五千零二十三公方，缩短线路三十一公里，避免两座一公里以上的大隧道。其节约价值约为一万二千亿元。
