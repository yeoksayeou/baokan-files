    Stalin's Party and Non-Party Alliance in Local Soviet Elections
    Fu Gantcharov, Representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic

    In the cities and villages of the Soviet Union, meetings for nominating candidates for representatives to the local Soviets of Working People's Deputies are being held amidst a great political upsurge.

    As in past elections, the Communist Party closely unites with non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals to participate in the current election in a unified alliance. Also, as in past election campaigns, the Party, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other organizations and groups of the working people are jointly welcoming this election. At the pre-election meetings of the working people, Communist Party members and non-Party individuals jointly discuss and propose outstanding sons and daughters of the people as candidates for representatives. These numerous pre-election meetings are a clear manifestation of the unshakable moral and political unity of Soviet society, the indestructible strength of Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance, and a powerful demonstration of the people closely united around the Party of Lenin and Stalin.

    The Party and non-Party alliance has its glorious history. Such an alliance between a political party and the people is impossible in the election campaigns of bourgeois countries because capitalist society is divided by irreconcilable contradictions between workers and capitalists, and peasants and landlords, and the internal situation is not stable. In the early years of Soviet power, such an alliance did not exist because the exploiting classes in the country had not yet been completely eliminated.

    This alliance could only be formed under the conditions of socialist victory, only in a society without exploiting classes and where people of all strata are already morally and politically united.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "For our country, the Party and non-Party alliance is a very natural phenomenon, because there are no more antagonistic classes in our country, and the moral and political unity of people of all strata has become an indisputable fact."

    For the idea of the Party and non-Party alliance to be victorious, it was necessary to carry out enormous socialist transformations in the economic and class structure of Soviet society. It was first necessary to establish a socialist economic foundation and lay a solid foundation for the state system of the dictatorship of the proletariat based on the alliance of the working class and the broad masses of working peasants. The policy of socialist industrialization of the country, reflected in the famous Stalin Five-Year Plans, precisely conformed to this task.

    Secondly, it was also necessary to solve the following task posed by history: to transform millions of small, backward peasant economies onto the track of huge, technologically equipped collective economies. The agricultural collectivization plan formulated and implemented by Stalin precisely conformed to this task. In the process of overall collectivization, the numerous bourgeoisie—the rich peasants—were eliminated.

    As a result of the great socialist transformation, the Soviet Union became a great power with strong industries and collective farms. The socialist public ownership of the means of production has been established in all sectors of the national economy as the foundation of the new socialist system. In socialist society, crises, poverty, unemployment, and bankruptcy have been permanently eliminated, and conditions have been created for the affluent and cultural life of all members of Soviet society.

    The class composition of the Soviet people has also changed accordingly. The working class has changed from an exploited and oppressed class into the leading force of the Soviet state. The Soviet peasants, freed from the enslavement of rich peasants, speculators, and usurers, are carrying out their activities on the basis of collective ownership. A new type of truly people's intelligentsia has been formed, which is an equal member of socialist society. The driving force of Soviet society's development—moral and political unity, the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and Soviet patriotism—has unfolded on the basis of socialist victory.

    The socialism that has been established in the Soviet Union has been legislatively expressed in the Soviet Constitution adopted in 1936.

    On December 12, 1937, Soviet workers elected representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in accordance with the new Constitution. It was also at this time that the Communist Party first placed the idea of the Party and non-Party electoral alliance at the forefront of its election policy.

    Life itself has shown the great strength of Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance. The elections of the Soviet state power organs have brought great victories to the Party and non-Party alliance every time.

    During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the indestructible moral and political unity of Soviet society was particularly powerfully manifested. The Communist Party united all the forces of the people to crush the enemy and strive for victory. As a result, the enemy was crushed. This further illustrates the invincible strength of the Soviet social system.

    In his historic speech at the meeting of voters in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow on February 9, 1946, Stalin, in talking about the essence of the Party and non-Party alliance, pointed out that the Soviet social system united Communist Party members and non-Party individuals into a common collective of Soviet people. "They live in a common collective, fight together to consolidate our power; they fought together on the battlefield and shed blood to defend the freedom and greatness of our motherland; they have jointly tempered and forged our victory over the enemy. The difference between them is only whether they are in the Party or not. But this is a formal distinction. The important point is that both are doing a common cause. Therefore, the alliance of Communist Party members and non-Party members is a natural and vital thing."

    The strength of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in its inseparable connection with the masses. In the struggle to win the freedom and independence of the socialist motherland and to build a communist society, the Party has become closer to the people and has consolidated its ties with the broad masses of working people. The Soviet people unanimously support the Party's policies and express their full confidence in it. It justly calls the Party of Lenin and Stalin the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time.

    The Party of Lenin and Stalin is the highest expression and soul of the moral and political unity of the Soviet people. There are no antagonistic classes within the Soviet Union, so the basis for the coexistence of several political parties does not exist. Under the leadership of its great leader Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has become the leading force of the Soviet people, and it is victoriously guiding the Soviet state towards communism. The post-war years have been years of great achievements in industry, agriculture, transportation, various scientific fields, and culture and art; at the same time, they have also been years of further consolidation of the Soviet system.

    The Soviet people warmly support and approve Stalin's foreign policy, which is in line with the interests of all mankind and is a policy of friendship and peace among all nations.

    The Party of Lenin and Stalin and the entire Soviet people are determined to continue to oppose preparations for a new war, to unite the powerful democratic camp against war in order to consolidate peace, to strengthen friendship and solidarity with peace defenders in all countries of the world, and to resolutely expose all preparations for a new war and all the conspiracies of war instigators. The Soviet people, led by the Communist Party, will continue to implement the policy of international cooperation and develop business relations with all countries, and continue to consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendly relations with the working people of the People's Democratic countries of Europe and Asia.

    The historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" unfolded a magnificent prospect for Soviet society's advance towards communism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, proceeding from the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by the great Stalin, guides the country's economy and culture in the direction needed by the Party and the people.

    Stalin taught us: "To ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the entire society, both material and cultural, by means of the constant growth and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher technology."

    Under the leadership of its great leader, the brilliant successor to Lenin's immortal cause—J.V. Stalin—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union resolutely and confidently guides the Soviet people towards communism.

    In previous election campaigns, Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance achieved brilliant victories. There is no doubt that it will achieve the same victory in the elections to the local Soviets in February-March 1953.

    地方苏维埃选举中的斯大林的党与非党联盟
    俄罗斯联邦共和国最高苏维埃代表符·冈察洛夫
    在苏联的城市与乡村中，为地方劳动者代表苏维埃提名代表候选人的会议，正在极大的政治高潮中进行着。
    正如过去历次的选举一样，共产党与非党的工人、农民及知识分子密切结合成统一的联盟来参加当前的选举。也正和过去的选举运动一样，党和职工会、共青团及劳动人民的其他组织与团体共同来迎接这次选举。在劳动者的预选大会上，共产党员与非党人士共同讨论并提出人民的优秀儿女作为代表的候选人。这种人数众多的预选大会是苏维埃社会不可动摇的道义上与政治上团结一致的显明表现，是斯大林的党与非党联盟底不可摧毁的力量和人民紧密地团结在列宁斯大林党周围的强有力的示威。
    党与非党联盟有它光荣的历史。政党与人民的这种联盟在资产阶级国家的选举运动中是不可能存在的。因为资本主义社会被工人与资本家间、农民与地主间不可调和的矛盾所割裂，内部情况不能稳固。而在苏维埃政权的最初几年，由于国内的剥削阶级还没有彻底消灭，所以也不曾有这种联盟。
    只有在社会主义胜利的条件下，只有在没有剥削阶级同时各阶层人民已经在道义上政治上团结一致的社会里，这种联盟才能形成。
    斯大林同志指示说：“对我们的国家来讲，党与非党联盟乃是很自然的现象，因为我国再没有敌对的阶级，而各阶层人民在道义上政治上的一致已成为无可争辩的事实。”
    为了党与非党联盟的思想能够获胜，必须在苏维埃社会的经济及阶级结构方面进行巨大的社会主义改造工作。必须首先建立社会主义的经济基础并为建立在工人阶级和劳动农民群众联盟基础上的无产阶级专政的国家制度，奠定巩固的基础。反映在历次著名的斯大林五年计划中的国家的社会主义工业化的政策，正符合这种任务。
    其次还必须解决历史所提出的下列任务：即将千百万细小的、落后的农民经济转引到巨大的、以新技术装备起来的集体经济的轨道上。斯大林制订并实行的农业集体化的计划正符合这一任务。在全盘集体化的过程中，人数众多的资产阶级——富农被消灭了。
    由于伟大的社会主义改造工作的结果，苏联变成了一个有着强有力的工业和集体农庄的大国。生产资料的社会主义公有制，在国民经济的所有部门中作为新的社会主义制度的基础而确立下来了。在社会主义社会中，永远消灭了危机、贫困、失业和破产，并为苏维埃社会所有成员的富裕的和文化的生活，创造了条件。
    苏联人民的阶级构成也相应发生了变化。工人阶级由被剥削、被压迫的阶级变成了苏维埃国家的领导力量。摆脱了富农、投机者、高利贷者奴役的苏维埃农民，在集体所有制的基础上进行自己的活动。新型的、真正人民的知识分子形成了，它是社会主义社会中平等的一员。苏维埃社会发展的动力—道义上政治上的一致，苏联各族人民的友谊、苏维埃的爱国主义，在社会主义胜利的基础上展开了。
    已在苏联确立的社会主义，在一九三六年通过的苏联宪法中取得了立法的表现。
    一九三七年十二月十二日，苏联劳动者根据新的宪法选举了苏联最高苏维埃的代表。也正是在这个时候共产党首次将党与非党选举联盟的思想放在选举政策的首位。
    生活本身已显示出斯大林党与非党联盟的巨大力量。苏维埃国家政权机关的选举，每次都为党与非党联盟带来了巨大的胜利。
    在伟大的卫国战争年代，苏维埃社会底不可摧毁的道义上政治上的一致性，得到了特别有力的表现。共产党团结了人民的一切力量去粉碎敌人和争取胜利。结果敌人被粉碎了。这更加说明了苏维埃社会制度的不可战胜的力量。
    一九四六年二月九日，斯大林在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上所作的有历史意义的讲演中谈到党与非党联盟的本质时曾指出，苏维埃的社会制度把共产党员与非党人士联合成一个共同的苏维埃人的集体了。“他们在共同集体中生活着，一同为巩固我国威力而进行了斗争；他们为了保卫我祖国底自由和伟大，一同在战场上作过战，流过血；他们一同锻炼过和锻炼成了我国战胜敌人的胜利。他们中间的差别，不过是在党或不在党罢了。但这是一种形式上的区别。重要点是在于两者都干着一件共同的事业。因此共产党员和非党员联盟便是一件自然而富有生气的事情。”
    苏联共产党的力量，在于它同群众间不可分割的联系。在争取社会主义祖国的自由与独立、争取建设共产主义社会的斗争中，党更加接近了人民并巩固了与广大劳动群众的联系。苏维埃人民一致拥护党的政策，并对它表示充分的信赖。它公正地把列宁斯大林的党称作我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。
    列宁斯大林的党是苏联人民道义上政治上一致的最高表现和灵魂。苏联内部没有敌对的阶级，因之几个政党共存的基础也就不存在了。苏联共产党在其伟大的领袖斯大林的领导下，成为苏联人民的领导力量，它正胜利地指导着苏维埃国家向共产主义前进。战后的几年，是工业、农业、运输业、各个科学部门及文化与艺术方面取得巨大成就的年份；同时也是苏维埃制度进一步巩固的年份。
    苏联人民热烈地支持并赞同斯大林的对外政策，这种政策符合全人类的利益，它是各国人民友好及和平的政策。
    列宁斯大林党和全体苏联人民都决心今后要继续反对新战争的准备，为了巩固和平要团结强大的反对战争的民主阵营，加强同世界各国和平保卫者的友谊与团结，坚决揭穿一切新战争的准备，及战争挑拨者的一切阴谋诡计。共产党所领导的苏联人民，将继续贯彻国际合作及开展同所有国家建立事务联系的政策，继续巩固与发展同欧、亚各人民民主国家劳动人民间不可摧毁的友谊关系。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会有历史意义的决议及斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”的天才著作，展开了苏维埃社会向共产主义前进的宏伟的前景。苏联共产党从伟大的斯大林所发现的社会主义的基本经济法则的要求出发，指导着国家的经济及文化向着党和人民所需要的方向发展。
    斯大林教导我们说：“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    苏联共产党在其伟大的领袖，列宁不朽事业的天才继承者——约·维·斯大林的领导下，坚决而满怀信心地引导着苏联人民走向共产主义。
    在以前几次的选举运动中，斯大林的党与非党联盟曾取得光辉的胜利。毫无疑问，在一九五三年二—三月间的地方苏维埃的选举中，它将取得同样的胜利。
