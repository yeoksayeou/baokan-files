Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force First-Class Hero Wang Hai
Letter of Congratulations to Soviet Air Force Hero Kozhedub
Dear Comrade Kozhedub, Hero of the Soviet Air Force:

    On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the great Soviet Army, please allow me to extend to you and your comrades-in-arms and all comrades my heartfelt and warm congratulations! Please allow me to report to you how much we admire and learn from your heroic example, and how your heroic deeds constantly inspire and educate us.

    In the spring of 1950, when you came to China with the Soviet cultural delegation, at a rally to welcome you, you reported how the Soviet people were working hard for their own happiness, building their country into the most ideal paradise in the world. You also spoke of the many inspiring heroic deeds that had emerged among the Soviet people in the struggle against the German fascist invasion. In particular, you had more than once achieved the glorious record of shooting down more than 60 enemy aircraft, often winning against the odds. We are constantly inspired by the fact that we have you and your country - our great ally, the Soviet Union. Therefore, we are constantly taking your actions as an example for us to learn from.

    I have read the novel about Comrade Alexei Maresyev – “The Story of a Real Man,” and I have also seen the film about Comrade Alexei Maresyev – “Winged Victory” ("The Man Without Legs"), and I have personally witnessed the glorious deeds of Comrade Kulichenko – who gloriously sacrificed himself to assist the Chinese people in resisting Japanese aggression and defending Wuhan. These have left indelible memories in the hearts of me, my comrades-in-arms, and the entire Chinese people. These heroic deeds constantly educate us and inspire us to move forward in struggle.

    Inspired by the heroic deeds of you and your comrades-in-arms - the Soviet heroes, since I joined the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, I have shot down and damaged a total of nine American invading aircraft. This achievement is very small; this is just the beginning of victory. In the future, I must more humbly learn from your great patriotism and internationalism, learn your heroic tenacity and the strong will to "always be the victor," and learn your valuable tactical and technical experience, so as to strike a heavier blow against the American aggressors and defend lasting peace in Asia and the world.

    Finally, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks and pay my highest respects to you!

    Your friend,
        Wang Hai, First-Class Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force

    中国人民志愿军空军一级英雄王海
    给苏联空军英雄阔日杜布的祝贺信
    亲爱的苏联空军英雄阔日杜布同志：
    在伟大的苏联军队建军三十五周年纪念日，请允许我向您和您的战友暨全体同志，表示衷心的热烈的祝贺！请允许我报告您：我们是怎样的敬爱着和学习着你们的英雄榜样；你们的英雄事迹是怎样的随时都在鼓舞着和教育着我们。
    一九五○年的春天，您随苏联文化代表团来到中国时，在一次欢迎您的大会上，您曾报告了苏联人民是怎样在为着自己的幸福，辛勤地劳动着，把自己的国家建设成为世界上最理想的乐园。您又谈到苏联人民在反击德国法西斯侵略的斗争中，曾经出现了多少可歌可泣的英雄事迹。尤其是您曾不只一次的以少胜多，取得了先后击落敌机六十余架的光辉战绩。我们时刻都在因为有了像您和您的祖国——我们伟大的盟邦苏联，而感到振奋。因此我们时刻都在以你们的行动当作我们学习的榜样。
    我读过关于描写阿历克谢·密里西耶夫同志——“真正的人”的小说，我也看过关于描写阿历克谢·密里西耶夫同志——“无脚飞将军”的电影，我更亲眼看到关于库里申科同志——为了援助中国人民抗击日寇，保卫中国的武汉而光荣牺牲的国际主义的光荣事迹。这些在我和我的战友，全中国的人民的心上都留下了永不泯灭的记忆。这些英雄的事迹，时刻的在教育我们，鼓舞着我们在斗争中前进。
    我在您和您的战友——苏联英雄们的英雄事迹鼓舞下，自参加抗美援朝的斗争以来，一共打落打伤了九架美国侵朝飞机。这个成绩是很小的，这只是胜利的开始，今后我一定要更虚心地来向你们的伟大的爱国主义与国际主义精神学习，学习你们的英勇顽强和“永远是胜利者”的坚强意志，学习你们的宝贵的战术与技术经验，以便更沉重地打击美国侵略军，保卫亚洲与世界的持久和平。
    最后，请允许我向你们表示衷心的感谢和致以崇高的敬意！
    您的朋友
        中国人民志愿军空军一级战斗英雄王海
                    一九五三年二月二十二日
