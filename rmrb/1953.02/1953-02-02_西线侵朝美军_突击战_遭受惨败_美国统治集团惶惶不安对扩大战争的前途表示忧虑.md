Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch:

    While U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins arrived in Korea to arrange new military adventures, the U.S. military launched a "blitzkrieg" offensive on January 25th against a mountain outpost northwest of Tieyuan on the western front (which the U.S. military calls "T-Bone Hill"). American news agencies admitted that this so-called "largest-scale offensive in more than three months" launched by the U.S. military in Korea suffered another crushing defeat, and has already caused fierce reactions in the United States.

    According to the Associated Press: the so-called "blitzkrieg" launched by the U.S. military against "T-Bone Hill" was carefully planned and prepared. U.S. military authorities "had planned it since January 16th - preparing to launch a joint land and air attack with infantry, artillery, air force and tanks." The International News Service also said, "The mission of destruction began on January 14th, with 105 and 155mm howitzers bombarding certain targets on T-Bone Hill. For weeks, planes have been bombing targets near the area... Patton tanks have been bombarding trenches and bunkers since January 17th." Before launching the offensive, the U.S. military authorities also held a "special briefing." According to the Associated Press, "Three generals and other senior land and air force officers attended the briefing," and news reporters were also invited. At the briefing, a seven-page "roadmap" with a color cover marked "Confidential" was distributed.

    "This booklet detailed the orders for the air force, artillery, tanks and infantry to launch the offensive. The offensive was carried out according to a timetable, until the infantry charged up the steep hillside under intense crossfire and grenade explosions." The U.S. military authorities were dreaming of victory.

    However, the American aggressor army's "roadmap" and "timetable" were shattered by the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Army. United Press admitted: "Despite the fierce artillery and air strikes, the Chinese Communists were ready, they hid from bombs, shells and napalm attacks in deep caves and bunkers, and then rushed out of the caves to meet the Allied forces head-on." The U.S. military authorities originally "presumed that the Chinese Communists would not be able to resist," but the result was that the Korean and Chinese People's Army "crushed the attacking troops." Right in front of those American "senior officers who were watching the coordinated offensive of aircraft, artillery, infantry and tanks in an advanced bunker," this U.S. military unit, which had "suffered heavy casualties" in the Battle of Triangle Hill, was once again beaten bloody and fled in panic. American reporters said: "Allied soldiers suffered heavy casualties," and "the enemy defenders entrenched in the deep trenches on T-Bone Hill caused the United Nations forces to lose face."

    The news of the U.S. military's failed offensive immediately caused fierce reactions in the United States. United Press Washington dispatches revealed that Republican congressmen Clare Hoffman, William Bray, Edith Rogers, and others criticized it and demanded that the U.S. Department of Defense state all the facts. The reactionary American newspapers also made a clamor. The "Chicago Tribune" and the "New York Daily News" demanded the punishment of those responsible.

    Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, had to submit a report, forced to admit that the result of the offensive was unfortunate and did not achieve its purpose. At the same time, the U.S. military authorities dismissed the press officer of the 7th Division, apparently because he had failed to cover up the disastrous defeat of the U.S. military in Korea. United Press also revealed that "because the public results were bad, it is said that the division participating in the offensive is preparing to prohibit reporters from reporting on it again."

    The disastrous failure of the U.S. military's offensive forced those congressmen and newspapers who were clamoring for the expansion of the war to weigh the facts and the consequences of expanding the war with concern. The "New York Herald Tribune" said: This attack "cost a great deal, proving what most observers have always reported—that the Chinese army's tunnel fortifications are extremely strong, and even fierce air and artillery attacks cannot destroy them first." United Press Washington January 27th dispatch revealed:

    "The unfortunate consequences of attacking the Chinese Communist positions on T-Bone Hill" made the members of Congress "all worried." "Most congressmen feel that Eisenhower will sooner or later force the beleaguered Allied forces to take the offensive. However, it is generally felt that the new offensive must not be a frontal assault on the Chinese Communist tunnel defenses like the 25th. Some congressmen believe that the president will order amphibious assaults on the Chinese Communist rear as the main attack, supplemented by frontal attacks, and at the same time, the air force will fiercely bomb the main Chinese Communist transportation routes and railway centers in North Korea." In addition, there are "extra measures" such as "naval blockade of the Chinese coast, air force attacks on the Communist bases in Manchuria, and the use of Chiang Kai-shek's troops to conduct guerrilla attacks on the Chinese mainland," but United Press quoted "American congressmen" as saying that all these plans "contain new dangers, and none of the plans can guarantee a final solution." These "congressmen" also said anxiously: "No matter what method is adopted, America's list of deaths will inevitably be longer."

### 西线侵朝美军“突击战”遭受惨败  美国统治集团惶惶不安对扩大战争的前途表示忧虑

    西线侵朝美军“突击战”遭受惨败
    美国统治集团惶惶不安对扩大战争的前途表示忧虑 【新华社一日讯】和美国陆军参谋长柯林斯到达朝鲜布置新军事冒险的同时，侵朝美军一月二十五日向朝鲜西线铁原西北我军一个山头阵地（美军把它叫做“丁字山”）发动了一次“突击战”。美方通讯社承认，侵朝美军发动的这个所谓“三个多月来最大规模的一次进攻”，再一次遭受惨败，并已在美国国内引起了激烈的反应。
    据美联社透露：美军这次对“丁字山”发动的所谓“突击战”，是经过周密策划和准备的。美军当局“从一月十六日就计划好了——预备用步兵、大炮、空军和坦克发动一次陆空军联合攻击”。国际新闻社并说“破坏的任务在一月十四日就已开始，一零五和一五五口径的榴弹炮轰击丁字山的某些目标。几个星期以来，飞机一直轰炸这个地区附近的目标。……巴顿式坦克自从一月十七日以来就一直在轰击壕沟和地堡。”在发动进攻前，美军当局还举行了一次“特别汇报”。据美联社透露“三个将领和另外一些高级陆空军军官参加汇报”，被邀请参加的还有新闻记者。在汇报时，发了一本印着“机密”字样的彩色封面的七页长的“路线图”，
    “这本小册子详细叙述了飞机、大炮、坦克和步兵发动进攻的命令。这种进攻是根据时间表来进行的，直到步兵们在猛烈的交叉火力和手榴弹爆炸下冲上陡峭的山坡。”美军当局就是这样做着胜利梦。
    但是，美国侵略军的什么“路线图”、“时间表”都被英勇的朝中人民军队打得粉碎了。合众社承认：“尽管大炮和飞机猛烈袭击，但共军已准备好了，他们在深厚的山洞和地堡里躲避炸弹、炮弹和凝固汽油弹的袭击，然后从山洞里冲出来，和联军正面相碰。”美军当局原来“推测共军已不能抵抗”，但是，结果是朝中人民军队“打垮了攻击的军队”。就在那些“在一个前进地堡中观看飞机、大炮、步兵和坦克协同进攻”的美国“高级军官”面前，这支曾在上甘岭战役中“遭受严重伤亡”的美军部队再一次被打得头破血流，狼狈逃窜。美国记者们说：“联军士兵遭到了重大的伤亡”，“在丁字山上深沟据守的敌方守军使联合国军丢了脸”。
    美军进攻失败的消息，立即在美国国内引起了激烈的反应。合众社华盛顿电透露，共和党众议员克莱尔·霍夫曼、威廉·布雷、伊迪思·罗杰斯等都纷纷加以抨击，并要求美国国防部陈述全部事实。美国反动报纸也发出一片叫闹声。“芝加哥论坛报”、“纽约每日新闻”都要求惩办负责人员。
    侵朝美国第八军军长范佛里特不得不提出报告，被迫承认：进攻结果很不幸，没有达到目的。同时，美军当局把第七师的新闻发布官撤了职，原因显然是由于他未能把侵朝美军遭到惨败的情形掩盖好。合众社并透露，“由于公开的结果不好，据说参加进攻的该师准备禁止记者再作报道”。
    美军进攻的惨败迫使美国那些狂妄叫嚣扩大战争的议员和报纸，不能不忧心地衡量一下面前的事实和扩大战争的后果。“纽约先驱论坛报”说：这次攻击“化了很大的代价，证明了大多数观察家一向所报道的情况——中国军队的坑道工事极其坚固，即使先对他们进行猛烈的空军和炮兵攻击，也不能击毁他们。”合众社华盛顿一月二十七日电透露说：
    “攻击丁字山的共军阵地的不幸后果”使得国会议员们“都怀着忧虑的心情”。“一般议员都觉得艾森豪威尔早晚一定要使进退维谷的联军采取攻势。可是，一般觉得新攻势决不能是像二十五日那样对共军地道防线发动正面进攻。有些国会人士认为总统将下令以两栖部队攻击共军后方为主，辅以正面进攻，同时，由空中猛烈轰炸北朝鲜主要的共军交通路和铁路中心。”此外，还有什么“海军封锁中国海岸，空军攻击满洲共产党基地，利用蒋介石军队对中国大陆进行游击进攻”等“额外办法”，但是，合众社引证“美国国会人士”的话说：所有这些计划“都包含着新的危险，没有一个计划能保证最终解决问题”。这些“国会人士”并惶惶不安地说：“不管采取什么办法，美国的死亡名单必定更长。”
