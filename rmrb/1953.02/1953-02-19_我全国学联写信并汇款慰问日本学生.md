Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: The All-China Students' Federation wrote a letter on February 18th and remitted 112 million RMB to Japanese students to express care and sympathy for their suffering, and to support their struggle. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Japanese students,

From Mr. Hatanaka Masaharu of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee's letter to Mr. Liu Ningyi of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee on November 26, 1952, we learned that among the 100,000 graduates of Japanese national high schools this March, 70,000 to 80,000 will be unemployed due to the inability to find jobs. Chinese students express sincere concern and sympathy for the suffering you are experiencing today.

In the past, the situation of Chinese students under the bloody rule of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang was the same as your situation today. Not only could we not receive reasonable and useful education, but the phenomenon of "graduation equals unemployment" was widespread. Therefore, Chinese students can fully understand your painful feelings today from personal experience.

Since the liberation of our motherland, our lives have become happier day by day. Over the past three years, with the recovery and development of China's economy, the cultural and educational undertakings of the New China have also advanced by leaps and bounds. The motherland cares for us students meticulously. Now, universities across the country not only waive tuition fees but also provide accommodation and meals, and provide living allowances for students with financial difficulties. In order to carry out large-scale construction, New China urgently needs all kinds of talents. When students are still in school, the motherland has already arranged jobs for every college graduate. "Graduation equals unemployment" has become a historical term. We deeply realize that this is because Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to drive away American imperialism and its running dogs through long and arduous struggles, and gained national independence, democracy and freedom, so that we can enjoy today's happy life.

Now, American imperialism is shamelessly occupying your country's land by force of arms and exploiting the blood and sweat of your compatriots through the Yoshida traitorous government to fulfill its conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and use Japan to expand its war of aggression. The Japanese people have already bravely taken up the banner of national independence, democracy, and freedom, and have risen up to fight against the American and Japanese reactionaries. Japanese youth and students have also stood on the front lines with the Japanese people to fight for the interests of the entire nation and the vital rights of young people, contributing their own strength. Chinese students watch you with respect and, together with the Chinese people, resolutely support your struggle. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of all of Asia and the world, and in your own persistent and unyielding struggle, you will eventually smash the conspiracy of American imperialism, realize a new Japan of peace, democracy, and independence, and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

In order to express the sympathy and concern of Chinese students for you, and to support your struggle, please accept the funds we have raised from students of well-known universities across the country (112 million RMB) as a welfare fund for Japanese university graduates. Although this amount is not large, we hope it will be helpful to Japanese students.

            With brotherly greetings,
            All-China Students' Federation
            February 18, 1953

    我全国学联写信并汇款慰问日本学生
    【新华社十八日讯】　中华全国学生联合会在十八日写信并汇寄人民币一亿一千二百万元给日本学生，对他们的苦难遭遇表示关怀和慰问，并支援他们的斗争。该信全文如下：亲爱的日本同学们：
    从日本和平联络委员会畑中政春先生一九五二年十一月二十六日给亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会刘宁一先生的来信中，我们得知今年三月日本全国高等学校的十万个毕业生中将有七万到八万人因找不到工作而失业。中国学生对于你们今日所遭遇的苦难表示亲切的关怀与慰问。
    中国学生过去在美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的血腥统治下所处的境遇与你们今日的境遇一样，不仅不能受到合理有用的教育，而且“毕业即是失业”的现象普遍存在，因此，中国学生从切身体验中完全能了解你们今天的痛苦心情。
    自从我们的祖国解放以来，我们的生活一天比一天幸福，三年多来随着我国经济的恢复和发展，新中国的文化教育事业亦飞跃前进。祖国对我们学生关怀得无微不至，现在全国大学不仅免收学费，还供给住宿与伙食，对于经济困难的同学则给予生活津贴；为了大规模的建设，新中国急需各种人才，当同学们还在学校上课的时候，祖国早就替每个大学毕业生安排了工作岗位；“毕业即是失业”已经成为历史上的名词了。我们深切体会这是由于毛主席和中国共产党领导全中国人民，经过长期艰苦的斗争赶走了美帝国主义及其走狗，获得了民族独立民主自由，才能享受到今天的幸福生活。
    现在美帝国主义正无耻地以武装霸占你们祖国的土地，并藉吉田卖国政府榨取你们同胞的血汗，以遂其复活日本军国主义，利用日本扩大侵略战争的阴谋。日本人民已经英勇地拿起民族独立民主自由的旗帜，起来与美日反动派作斗争，日本青年学生也已经与日本人民一起为争取整个民族的利益和青年切身的权利站在战斗的前线，贡献了自己的力量。中国学生满怀敬意的注视着你们，并与中国人民一起坚决支持你们的斗争。我们深信你们在全亚洲、全世界人民的支持下，在你们自己坚持不屈的斗争中，最后必将粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋，实现和平、民主、独立的新日本，巩固亚洲与世界的和平。
    为了表达中国学生对你们的同情与关怀，为了支援你们的斗争，请接受我们从国内各著名大学同学中募集的款项（一亿一千二百万元人民币）作为日本大学毕业同学们的福利金，这笔款项的数字虽然不大，但愿对日本同学有所帮助。
            谨致兄弟般的敬礼中华全国学生联合会
            一九五三年二月十八日
