International Briefs

Large Numbers of US Troops in Korea Use Drugs
According to the American United Press, American Cardinal Spellman, who recently visited Korea, said on January 26 that military doctors in Korea told him that a "shocking number" of American soldiers were using drugs. He also said: The American youths who use drugs apparently were addicted before they enlisted in the country.
The "Los Angeles Daily News" also revealed the situation of a large number of American soldiers using drugs. The newspaper quoted a former American police officer who worked in Korea as saying that thousands of American soldiers had become drug addicts.

US Government Sends Soldiers Unwilling to Fight Abroad to Korea
The US Department of the Army is forcibly sending American soldiers who are unwilling to fight abroad to Korea as cannon fodder. According to the Associated Press: "The first batch of deserters and AWOL soldiers dispatched to Korea in accordance with the Army Department's new tough policy were escorted by armed guards to Camp Stoneman, California on January 29." A US military spokesman revealed that this group of soldiers totaled 105 people, and they "will be put on transport ships within three to seven days," and "most of them will probably be assigned to frontline units."

Worker Injuries and Deaths in Japanese Factories and Mines Continue to Increase
Under the cruel exploitation of the US and Japanese reactionaries, worker injuries and deaths in Japanese mines and factories continue to increase. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, worker injuries and deaths in Japan have increased two to three times. According to Japanese government statistics for 1951 alone, an average of 20 workers died in Japan every day, and more than four workers were seriously injured every minute. Due to the coal capitalists' adoption of the method of mining with fewer support pillars, forcing workers to intensify their labor in mines lacking safety equipment, the number of worker injuries and deaths in Japanese coal mines amounts to as many as 120,000 cases a year.

    侵朝美军大批士兵吸食毒品
    据美国的合众社透露：曾在最近访问朝鲜的美国红衣主教斯培尔曼一月二十六日说，朝鲜的军医告诉他，“惊人大量的”美国士兵吸食毒品。他又说：吸食毒品的美国青年显然都是在国内入伍以前就开始上瘾的。
    关于大批美军士兵吸毒的情形，美国“洛杉矶日报”也有透露。该报曾引述前在朝鲜工作的一个美国警官的话说：上千的美国兵已成为毒品吸食者。
    美国政府把不愿离国作战士兵押往朝鲜
    美国陆军部正把不愿离国作战的美军士兵，强迫送到朝鲜去当炮灰。据美联社透露：“依照陆军部的新的强硬政策而被派往朝鲜的第一大批逃兵和擅自离职的士兵，已在一月二十九日由武装卫兵押解到加利福尼亚州斯东曼营”。美国军方发言人透露，这批兵士共为一百零五人，他们“将在三天到七天之内被送上运输舰”，而且，其中“大多数大概会派到前线部队中去”。
    日本厂矿中工人伤亡事件不断增多
    在美、日反动派的残酷剥削下，日本矿山和工厂中发生的工人伤亡事件不断增多。自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，日本工人的伤亡事件增加到两倍以至三倍。仅仅根据日本政府一九五一年的统计，日本全国平均每天有二十名工人死亡，每一分钟有四名以上的工人受重伤。由于煤业资本家采用了少架支柱采煤法，强迫工人在缺乏安全设备的矿井中加强劳动强度，因此日本各煤矿中一年所发生的工人伤亡事件多到十二万起。
