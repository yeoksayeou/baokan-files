    The People's Army is Invincible
    —Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
    Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    The heroic Korean People's Army has undergone severe and glorious tests on its historical path. On June 25, 1950, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea began its anti-aggression war of national defense. For more than thirty months, the Korean People's Army has endured hardships and grown stronger in the flames of war. This heroic army, revered by hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, is advancing confidently towards final victory.

    The fact that the Korean People's Army has grown and strengthened once again proves the truth that the people's army is invincible. It has greatly inspired all people's armed forces engaged in just wars.

    As everyone knows, when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was less than two years old, the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang launched a war of aggression against North Korea, attempting to easily win in an unjust war and strangle the young People's Republic. At this time, the Korean People's Army, which had been born for just over two years, undertook the great task of defending its motherland. In the process of the anti-aggression war, it fought with unparalleled bravery against the joint offensive of the invading armies of nineteen countries, led by the American invading army. In the early days of the war, the Korean People's Army resolutely inflicted annihilating blows on the Syngman Rhee bandit army, and heavily struck the main force of the American invading army in Korea—the 24th and 25th Divisions. Later, in the extremely difficult years when the American aggressors stepped up their offensive, the Korean People's Army, with the strong assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that stepped forward, frustrated the crazy invasion of the American and Rhee bandit armies into the northern part of Korea south of the Yalu River, and drove the enemy back to the starting point of its offensive—near the 38th parallel. For more than two years, the Korean People's Army, fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, has achieved a great victory: annihilating 740,000 enemy troops (including more than 320,000 American troops), shooting down and damaging more than 7,800 enemy aircraft, and consolidating its positions in the area near the 38th parallel, stabilizing the Korean war situation, smashing the American imperialist's sinister war plan to destroy Korea and then attack China, and effectively defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    In the severe and glorious tests, the Korean People's Army has shown itself to be the loyal defender of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and a heroic force defending peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, it has been warmly loved and fully supported by the Korean people, and respected and supported by peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Korean People's Army, which has only been established for five years, has defeated the American invading army, which has been established for more than 100 years, fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. What is the reason for this?

    This is because the Korean People's Army is a people's army armed with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. The outstanding sons and daughters of Korea raised the weapons of justice to organize their army, inheriting and carrying forward the traditional spirit of the Korean nation in resisting foreign invasions and fighting against Japan. They love their motherland and love freedom; in order to defend the independence of their motherland and defend the cause of peace, they can endure all hardships, spare no sacrifice of blood, and advance wave upon wave, bravely and fearlessly. The vigorous attacking spirit of the People's Army makes the enemy tremble with fear; the tenacious defensive spirit of the People's Army makes the attacking enemy daunted. The 1211 Heights on the eastern front of Korea, guarded by the Korean People's Army, was called "Heartbreak Ridge" by the enemy because of repeated disastrous defeats in attacking it, while the officers and soldiers of the People's Army proudly call it "Kim Il-sung Mountain Ridge."

    This is because it is an army organized and educated under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people's beloved leader, General Kim Il-sung. The Korean People's Army inherited the valuable combat experience of General Kim Il-sung's leadership in the anti-Japanese armed struggle. The commanders of the Korean People's Army are the backbone who have been tempered like steel in the long-term anti-Japanese armed struggle. From the very beginning, General Kim Il-sung attached importance to giving the Korean People's Army strict military training with the highest achievements of modern military science—Stalinist military science and the experience of building the Soviet armed forces. In the war against the American aggressors, General Kim Il-sung constantly absorbed practical experience and improved the combat effectiveness of the Korean People's Army. Therefore, the Korean People's Army has become an invincible people's army with a high degree of organization, discipline, advanced military technology, and modern war experience.

    In more than two years of fighting against a common enemy, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have fought closely side by side. The Korean People's Army has given the Chinese People's Volunteer Army various support and assistance at all times and in all places, demonstrating the great spirit of exemplary internationalist unity and friendship. Therefore, we sincerely thank all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and its Supreme Commander General Kim Il-sung, and are determined to further enhance this noble combat friendship.

    All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly congratulate our closest comrades-in-arms—the Korean People's Army—on the anniversary of its founding with incomparable pride and joy. On this glorious day, we have not forgotten that the American aggressors are stepping up preparations to launch new military adventures. Our fraternal Chinese and Korean people's armies must fight more resolutely and bravely to give the invading enemy a greater blow. Under the wise command of General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, let us strive for more brilliant achievements and more lofty honors!

    Long live the Workers' Party of Korea, the leader and inspirer of the Korean People's Army!

    Long live General Kim Il-sung, the founder and organizer of the Korean People's Army!

    Long live the unbreakable combat friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army!

    人民军队是不可战胜的
    ——纪念朝鲜人民军建军五周年
    中国人民志愿军政治部副主任  杜平
    英雄的朝鲜人民军在自己的历史道路上经历了严重的、光荣的考验。一九五零年六月二十五日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国开始了反侵略的卫国战争。三十多个月来，朝鲜人民军历尽艰难困苦，在战火中愈战愈强。这一支被全世界爱好和平的亿万人民所敬仰的英雄军队，正满怀信心地向着最后胜利奋勇前进。
    朝鲜人民军发展壮大的事实又一次证明了一个真理，即人民军队是不可战胜的。它对于一切进行正义战争的人民武装力量是起着极大的鼓舞作用的。
    尽人皆知：当朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立不到二周年的时候，美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮向北朝鲜发动了侵略战争，企图在非正义战争中轻易获胜，扼死年青的人民共和国。在这时候，诞生不过两年多的朝鲜人民军便担负起保卫自己祖国的伟大任务，它在反侵略战争过程中无比英勇地抗击了以美国侵略军为首的十九个国家侵略军队的联合进攻。在战争初期，朝鲜人民军坚决地给予李承晚匪军以歼灭性打击，并沉重地打击了美国侵朝军队的主力——第二十四师与第二十五师。后来在美国侵略者加紧进攻的极端艰难的岁月里，朝鲜人民军在挺身而出的中国人民志愿军的强大援助下，挫败了美李匪军向鸭绿江以南朝鲜北部地区的疯狂进犯，将敌军逐回到它发动进攻的出发地——三八线附近。两年多来，朝鲜人民军在与中国人民志愿军的并肩作战中取得了伟大的胜利：歼灭敌军七十四万人
    （其中美军占三十二万多人），击落击伤敌机七千八百多架，并在三八线附近地区巩固了自己的阵地，稳定了朝鲜战局，粉碎了美帝国主义灭亡朝鲜，进而进攻中国的罪恶的战争计划，有效地保卫了远东和世界的和平。
    朝鲜人民军在严重的光荣的考验中，显示出自己是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国忠诚的保卫者，显示出是保卫远东和世界和平的英雄部队，因此，它受到了朝鲜人民的热烈爱戴和全力支援，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的尊敬和支持。
    建军只有五年的朝鲜人民军，在与中国人民志愿军并肩作战中击败了建军一百多年的美国侵略军，这是什么原因呢？
    这是因为朝鲜人民军是一支以高度的爱国主义和国际主义思想武装起来的人民军队。朝鲜的优秀儿女举起正义的武器组织了自己的军队，继承与发扬了朝鲜民族反抗异族入侵及抗日斗争的传统精神。他们热爱祖国，热爱自由；为了保卫祖国的独立与保卫和平事业，他们能够忍受一切艰难困苦，不惜任何牺牲流血，前仆后继，勇往直前。人民军的旺盛的攻击精神，使敌军胆战心寒；人民军的坚韧的守备精神，使进攻的敌军望而生畏。朝鲜人民军守卫的朝鲜东部战线的一二一一高地，敌人因在那里屡次进攻惨败而叫它为“伤心岭”，人民军官兵们则自豪地称呼它为“金日成山岭”。
    这是因为它是在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成将军的领导下组织和教养起来的军队。朝鲜人民军继承了金日成将军领导抗日武装斗争的宝贵的战斗经验，朝鲜人民军的指挥员是在长期抗日武装斗争中锻炼得钢铁般坚强的骨干。金日成将军一开始就重视以现代军事科学的最高成就——斯大林军事科学，苏联武装部队的建军经验，给予朝鲜人民军以严格的军事训练。在反抗美国侵略者的卫国战争中，金日成将军又不断地吸取实战经验，提高朝鲜人民军的战斗力。因此，朝鲜人民军已成为具有高度组织性、纪律性，具有先进军事技术、现代战争经验的不可战胜的人民军队。
    在两年多反对共同敌人的战斗中，英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军亲密地并肩作战，朝鲜人民军随时随地给予中国人民志愿军以各种支援和帮助，表现了模范的国际主义的团结友爱的伟大精神。因此，我们衷心地感谢朝鲜人民军全体官兵及其最高司令官金日成将军，并决心进一步增强这种高贵的战斗友谊。
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员以无比骄傲与欢欣的心情，热烈祝贺我们最亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军的建军节日。在这个光荣的日子里，我们没有忘记美国侵略者正在加紧准备发动新的军事冒险，我们兄弟般的中、朝人民军队必须更坚决更勇敢地去作战，给敢于进犯的敌人以更大的打击。让我们在朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员的英明指挥之下，争取更辉煌的成就，更崇高的荣誉！
    朝鲜人民军的领导者与鼓舞者朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    朝鲜人民军的创建者与组织者金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
