Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd Dispatch: According to a Deutsche Press Agency Berlin dispatch: The "Exhibition of American Government's Crimes of Germ Warfare" closed in Berlin on the evening of February 20th. From January 24th to February 20th, a total of 142,200 people visited the exhibition, setting a record for the number of visitors to this type of exhibition held in Berlin. Visitors included people from all districts of Berlin, various parts of the Democratic Republic, and West Germany, including doctors, scientists, construction workers, engineers, housewives, and students. Workers from many factories visited the exhibition collectively and held discussions afterward.

The exhibition has left a deep impression on the German people. A visitor from West Berlin wrote in the guestbook: "I didn't quite believe in germ warfare before, because I thought it was impossible to commit such a crime against humanity. The scientific evidence [at the exhibition] has completely convinced me, so I will redouble my efforts to fight for peace and tell everyone about the danger that threatens us."

During the exhibition, the Chinese delegation also went to hospitals and factories in Berlin and throughout the German Democratic Republic to report on the American government's crimes of germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. Doctors, nurses, and staff at the Ludwig Hoffmann Hospital in Berlin, after hearing the report, unanimously passed a resolution stating: "As warriors fighting against death and disease, we strongly oppose the inhumane war waged by the United States and pledge to use all our strength to oppose germ warfare and restore world peace." Workers at the "Walter Ulbricht" Leuna plant and the Jena pharmaceutical factory made assurances to the Chinese delegation, expressing their determination to strengthen solidarity with the Chinese and Korean people to support the struggle to defend peace.

The Exhibition of American Government's Crimes of Germ Warfare will continue in Leipzig from February 27th and will later be exhibited in other cities in the German Democratic Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd Dispatch: Berlin News: The American government's criminal research into germ warfare in West Germany has caused a typhus epidemic in West Germany.

According to a Deutsche Press Agency report: In Stuttgart, where the typhus epidemic began, hospitals had already admitted more than 350 typhus patients by the beginning of this month. Recently, typhus has gradually spread from Baden-Württemberg to Hesse.

The Vienna "Abend" newspaper published a Stuttgart dispatch, citing materials provided by Stuttgart health officials, saying that typhus initially occurred in American troops stationed on the outskirts of Stuttgart who were responsible for special tasks. The cause of the epidemic was carelessness in a bacteriological laboratory. A German who worked for such a special American agency in the Stuttgart area confirmed that the main task of this agency was to study effective methods for launching germ warfare in Europe.

According to a Deutsche Press Agency report: There are currently many such American laboratories engaged in bacteriological research in southern West Germany. The most noteworthy is the special unit of the U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division engaged in chemical warfare research and chemical and bacteriological warfare preparations.

The appointment of Harvard University President Dr. Conant by Eisenhower to succeed Donnelly as the U.S. High Commissioner to West Germany after he took office has special significance. Conant is an "expert" in the so-called chemical and bacteriological warfare in the United States.

The American occupation authorities were clearly alarmed by the leak of news about the American military's bacteriological warfare research and preparations in West Germany and quickly tried to block it. According to the "Abend," the American military authorities ordered the Stuttgart administrative authorities to confiscate all investigation materials from the health bureau regarding the source of the typhus epidemic. The German who revealed the American preparations for germ warfare has been arrested by the American military police.

    柏林“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”闭幕
    美国在西德进行细菌战研究引起西德斑疹伤寒的流行
    【新华社二十二日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”已于二月二十日晚在柏林闭幕。从一月二十四日起到二月二十日为止，共有十四万两千两百人参观了这个展览会，创柏林举行的这一类展览会参观人数的纪录。参观者包括来自柏林各区、民主共和国各地及西德的人民，其中有医生、科学家、建筑工人、工程师、家庭主妇和学生。许多工厂的工人曾集体参观展览会参观后并进行了讨论。
    展览会在德国人民中已留下了深刻的印象。一个西柏林的参观者在意见簿上写道：“我原来不十分相信有细菌战这样的事，因为我认为进行这种反对人类的罪行是不可能的。（展览会上）这些科学的证据使我完全信服了，因此我要加倍努力争取和平，并把威胁着我们的危险告诉每一个人。”
    在展览会展出期间，中国代表团并曾到柏林及民主德国各地的医院与工厂中去作有关美国政府在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战罪行的报告。柏林路德维希·霍夫曼医院听过报告的医生、护士及工作人员一致通过决议，其中说：“作为向死亡和疾病进行斗争的战士，我们带着强烈的憎恶反对美国反人道的战争，并保证用我们的全力反对细菌战，恢复世界和平。”“瓦尔特·乌布利希”洛埃纳工厂和耶拿制药厂的工人们向中国代表团提出保证：表示决心加强与中国及朝鲜人民的团结，以支持保卫和平的斗争。
    美国政府细菌战罪行展览会将自二月二十七日起在来比锡继续举行，以后并将在民主德国其他城市中展出。
    【新华社二十二日讯】柏林消息：美国政府在西德进行细菌战的罪恶研究已经引起西德斑疹伤寒的流行。
    据德意志通讯社消息：在斑疹伤寒开始流行的斯图加特，医院还在本月初就已收容了三百五十多名斑疹伤寒病人。最近，斑疹伤寒并已从巴登—瓦登堡州逐渐蔓延到黑森州。
    维也纳“晚报”曾刊载斯图加特消息，引斯图加特卫生局职员所提供的材料说：斑疹伤寒最初发生在驻扎在斯图加特郊外的、负担着特种任务的美国部队中。疫病发生原因是一个细菌试验室中的工作不慎。在斯图加特地区一个美国这种特种机关工作的一个德国人证实：这个机关的主要工作是研究在欧洲发动细菌战的有效方法。
    据德意志通讯社报道：在西德南部，目前有许多这种从事细菌研究的美国实验所。最值得注意的是：美军坦克第二师的从事化学战研究和化学及细菌战准备工作的特别部。
    艾森豪威尔上台后任命哈佛大学校长康南特博士继董尼利为美国驻西德的高级专员一事，具有特殊的意义。康南特是美国所谓化学细菌战争的“专家”。
    美国占领军当局对于美军在西德从事细菌战研究和准备工作的消息的泄露显然感到惊慌，赶紧想加以封锁。据“晚报”说，美国军事当局曾勒令斯图加特行政当局没收卫生局有关斑疹伤寒流行病的病源的一切调查材料。曾经透露过美国准备细菌战争的德国人已被美国宪兵逮捕。
