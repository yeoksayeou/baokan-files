Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 26th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the morning of February 25th. The meeting first discussed the order of the agenda. The Korean issue was listed as the first item on the agenda. The Greek representative suggested that after discussing the Korean issue, the so-called issue of certain member states detaining personnel of the Greek armed forces should be discussed. The Polish representative, Skrzeszewski, suggested that the second item on the agenda should be the Polish proposal on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation." The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, and the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, David, supported the Polish proposal. However, the American voting machine passed the Greek proposal. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, then suggested that the Polish proposal be listed as the third item on the agenda, pointing out that safeguarding peace is the primary task of the United Nations, but the American mechanical majority again rejected this suggestion.

The Committee then began to discuss the Korean issue. The American representative, Lodge, spoke, attempting to make people believe that the responsibility for the continuation of the war lay with the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union. He insisted that the Indian proposal adopted by the General Assembly "represented the world's desire for peace." Lodge also made slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union.

Vyshinsky proposed inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion. He emphasized that to seriously study the Korean issue, it is unimaginable without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The American representative opposed Vyshinsky's proposal.

The Czechoslovak representative, David, supported the Soviet proposal. He said that the United States was trying to prevent the direct victims of American aggression from presenting evidence at the United Nations. The Polish representative, Skrzeszewski, also said that the United States was afraid that its actions to undermine the Panmunjom armistice negotiations would be exposed. The Indonesian representative, Palar, agreed with the Soviet proposal, saying that since the United Nations had held negotiations with North Korea in Panmunjom, they should be invited to participate in the discussion, which might facilitate a solution to the problem.

The Byelorussian representative, Kiselev, and the Ukrainian representative, Baranovsky, both spoke in support of the Soviet proposal.

Vyshinsky then spoke, refuting Lodge's absurd arguments against allowing representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

The Political Committee rejected the Soviet proposal. Sixteen representatives voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, thirty-five representatives voted against, and six representatives abstained.

    联大政委会开始讨论朝鲜问题
    维辛斯基建议邀请朝鲜人民代表参加讨论
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二月二十五日上午举行会议。会议首先讨论议程次序问题。朝鲜问题列为第一项议程。希腊代表建议在讨论朝鲜问题以后，接着就讨论所谓某些会员国扣留希腊武装部队人员的问题。波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基建议第二项议程应该讨论波兰所提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基及捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维支持波兰的建议。然而，美国表决机器通过了希腊的建议。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基接着建议把波兰的提案列为第三项议程，他指出保卫和平是联合国的首要任务，但是美国机械多数又否决了这个建议。
    委员会然后即开始讨论朝鲜问题。美国代表洛奇发言，他企图使人相信，战争继续进行的责任在于中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联身上。他硬说大会所通过的印度提案“代表了世界要求和平的愿望”。洛奇并对苏联进行诽谤性的攻击。
    维辛斯基提议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论，他强调说，要郑重地研究朝鲜问题，没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，是不可以想像的。
    美国代表反对维辛斯基的提议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维支持苏联的建议。他说，美国试图阻止美国侵略的直接受害者在联合国提出证据。波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基也说，美国害怕它破坏板门店停战谈判的行为被人揭穿。印尼代表巴拉赞成苏联的建议，他说，联合国既然与北朝鲜在板门店进行了谈判，便应该邀请他们来参加讨论，这样可能促使问题获得解决。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫和乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基都发言表示支持苏联建议。
    维辛斯基接着发言，驳斥洛奇反对让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席联合国大会的荒谬论据。
    政治委员会拒绝了苏联的建议。十六个代表投票赞成苏联的建议，三十五个代表投票反对，有六个代表弃权。
