Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th - According to the London "Daily Worker", the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Harry Pollitt, issued a statement on the 6th, calling on all powerful popular forces to take action to prevent new wars.
Pollitt said: A powerful mass movement should be launched throughout Britain so that every peace-loving British citizen can take immediate action against Eisenhower's war policy. It is necessary to make Anglo-American imperialism know in this way that under no circumstances can the British people be dragged into a war with the People's China.
Pollitt pointed out: Churchill's cowardly silence in the House of Commons debate on Eisenhower's war policy against the People's China is a warning to every British citizen. No matter how eloquently his aide Eden tries to deceive the British people, Churchill's entire past experience proves that he is against everything with progressive and socialist content. Therefore, he will definitely support any aggressive action taken by the American reactionaries in the end.
Pollitt mentioned some speeches made by Labour MPs and emphasized that speeches in Parliament alone cannot stop the actions of Eisenhower, Dulles, Churchill, Eden and their ilk. They must be made to believe by the actions of the masses that the people will never allow their war plans to succeed.
Pollitt continued: In stark contrast to the warmongering statements and actions of Eisenhower and Dulles, Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's China has once again called for an immediate ceasefire in Korea.
Pollitt called on the British people to send delegations to visit all members of Parliament and ask them to support the following suggestions:
\tI. Immediately revoke the British consulate in Taiwan and convene a special meeting of the United Nations, at which the United States should be condemned as an aggressor state.
\tII. The People's China must be given its legitimate seat on the United Nations Security Council.
\tIII. British troops must be withdrawn from Korea immediately, and a ceasefire must be agreed immediately.
\tIV. Unconditionally oppose the demands made by Dulles during his visit to London.
Pollitt emphasized: Now, the opportunity to launch the largest joint movement to stop the implementation of Eisenhower's war plan is greater than ever before.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th - London, 3rd - The British workers have given a decisive answer to the notice issued by the Labour Party General Secretary Morgan Phillips, which requested the Labour Party and trade union organizations to send letters to the Soviet Embassy to support India's proposal on the Korean issue at the United Nations.
Six branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in Sheffield have rejected or amended Phillips's notice, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea. The Sheffield Eighth Branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union demanded that the Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union convene a special meeting to discuss this issue. The District Committee itself also demanded that a ceasefire be implemented immediately in Korea, and then a prisoner of war repatriation committee be established in accordance with the Geneva Convention. It also agreed to convene a conference on resolving the Korean issue.
Two branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in Rotherham demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea. The Sixteenth Branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in Leeds also rejected Phillips's notice. The Eckersley Field Branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union expressed disgust at the attempt to use trade union organizations as rubber stamps to support the Indian proposal. It demanded that the Executive Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union urge an immediate ceasefire.
The Shamrock Branch (Paddington) of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers amended the draft resolution distributed in the leadership of the union federation, which demanded that the Soviet Union accept the Indian proposal, adding the words: "The only way to peace in Korea is an immediate ceasefire and the repatriation of all prisoners of war."
The Holmes Factory Branch of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the United Road Transport Workers' Association, branches in Sheffield private enterprises, and two branches in Hull and Leeds, have all rejected Phillips's notice and demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea.
Shop stewards at the Firth Brown and Hadfields steelworks in Sheffield have demanded a ceasefire in Korea and the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
The Westhoughton Labour Party branch and the Blainscough Labour Party district branch have rejected Phillips's notice.
In addition, the British-Soviet Friendship Society printed 100,000 leaflets exposing the intention of Phillips's notice. The British-Soviet Friendship Society distributed the leaflets to local Labour Party branches, Trades Union Congress delegates, trade union executive committees and other organizations.

    英共总书记波立特号召英国人民行动起来
    反对艾森豪威尔的战争政策
    英国工会地方组织纷纷要求立刻停止侵朝战争 【新华社布拉格九日电】据伦敦“工人日报”报道，英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特六日发表声明，号召各方面强大的人民力量都行动起来，防止新的战争。
    波立特说：应该在全英国发动一次强大的群众运动，使每个爱好和平的英国公民都能立即行动起来，反对艾森豪威尔的战争政策。必须用这样的办法使英美帝国主义知道，在任何情况下，决不能把英国人民拖入与人民中国的战争中。
    波立特指出：在下议院关于艾森豪威尔对人民中国的战争政策的辩论中，邱吉尔保持了懦弱的沉默，这是对每个英国公民的一个警告。不论他的助手艾登说得如何天花乱坠来蒙蔽英国人民，但是邱吉尔过去的整个经历证明他是反对一切具有进步与社会主义内容的东西的，因此，他一定会在最后支持美国反动派采取的任何侵略行动。
    波立特提到工党议员们所发表的一些演说，强调：光靠议会中的演说是不能制止艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、邱吉尔、艾登之流的行径的。必须用人民群众的行动来使他们相信，人民决不会让他们的战争计划收到效果。
    波立特继续说：与艾森豪威尔及杜勒斯的好战的声明和行动刚好相反，人民中国的周恩来总理再度要求在朝鲜立即停火。
    波立特号召英国人民派出代表团访问所有议会议员，要求他们支持下列各项建议：
    一、立即撤销英国驻台湾的领事馆，并召开联合国特别会议，会上应谴责美国为侵略国家。
    二、必须让人民中国取得在联合国安全理事会中的合法地位。
    三、必须立即从朝鲜撤出英国军队，并同意立即停火。
    四、无条件反对杜勒斯在访问伦敦时提出的要求。
    波立特着重指出：现在，展开最大的联合运动来制止艾森豪威尔战争计划的实现的机会比以前任何时候都大。 【新华社布拉格九日电】伦敦三日航讯：英国工人对于工党总书记摩根·菲利普斯的通告已经提出了断然的答复，这个通告要求工党和工会组织致函苏联大使馆，支持印度在联合国提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案。
    混合机器工会在设菲尔德的六个分会已经拒绝或是修改了菲利普斯的通告，要求在朝鲜立刻停火。混合机器工会设菲尔德第八分会要求混合机器工会设菲尔德区委员会召集特别会议来讨论这个问题。区委员会本身也要求首先在朝鲜立刻停火，然后根据日内瓦公约成立一个遣俘委员会。它同时同意召开一个关于解决朝鲜问题的会议。
    混合机器工会罗塞翰的两个分会要求在朝鲜立刻停火。混合机器工会里子第十六分会也拒绝了菲利普斯的通告。混合机器工会的艾克尔斯菲尔德分会对于要想利用工会组织作为橡皮图章来支持印度提案的企图表示厌恶。它要求混合机器工会执行委员会力促立即停火。
    建筑工人工会联合会沙姆罗克分会（巴丁顿）修改了在该工会联合会领导方面散发的要求苏联接受印度提案的决议草案，加进了这样的话：“朝鲜和平的唯一办法是立刻停火，并遣返所有战俘。”
    钢铁工会联合会荷尔姆斯工厂分会、送货工人联合会、在设菲尔德私营企业中的分会以及在赫尔和里子的两个分会，都已经拒绝了菲利普斯的通告，并要求在朝鲜立刻停火。
    设菲尔德大炼钢工厂弗斯布朗和夏德罗斯两厂的车间代表都要求在朝鲜停火，并根据日内瓦公约的规定遣返战俘。
    威塞恩西的工党支部和布兰因柯顿的工党区分部都拒绝了菲利普斯的通告。
    此外，英苏友好协会印发了十万份传单，揭露菲利普斯的通告的企图。英苏友好协会把传单分发给工党各地支部、职工大会代表、工会执行委员会和其它组织。
