    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: The supply of non-staple foods for the Spring Festival in cities across the country is guaranteed. Since the Central Ministry of Commerce issued a directive on January 24th to national state-owned commercial departments, calling for "fully preparing resources to guarantee the supply of Spring Festival goods," state-owned companies in various regions have promptly made preparations, closely collaborating with cooperatives, and organizing private merchants to fully ensure the supply of non-staple foods before the Spring Festival. As of now, according to reports from major cities, price reductions have been widespread across the country since February 7th, ensuring the sufficient supply of major non-staple foods and the complete stability of the market before the festival. In Shanghai, due to outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in some areas, the transportation of live pigs from the surrounding countryside into the city has been prohibited. The city has prepared a total of 55,000 live pigs and frozen pork from within the city to supply residents. In addition, there is also exported frozen pork as a reserve force. Fresh and frozen chicken and fish are also being supplied to the market in large quantities. Except for glutinous rice, which is currently being rushed in, the supply of other major non-staple foods has been guaranteed. In Beijing, state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private merchants have not only stored large quantities of pork and beef but are also continuously transporting 7,000 sheep. During discussions on Spring Festival supply, private merchants expressed their commitment to guaranteeing the supply of vegetables and pastries. In Tianjin, a survey team was organized three days before the price reductions to conduct key inspections. Apples, which were initially in short supply, have now been transported from the Northeast by three trainloads to supply the market. Other cities such as Shenyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou have generally met the needs of their residents and guaranteed the supply of non-staple foods for the Spring Festival.

    全国各地保证了春节副食品的供应工作
    【新华社十二日讯】全国各城市春节副食品供应工作已有保证。自中央商业部于一月二十四日向全国国营商业部门发出“充分准备力量保证春节物资供应”的指示后，各地国营公司都及时进行了准备，紧密联系合作社并组织私商全力保证了春节前的副食品供应。截至目前，根据各大城市报告，自二月七日起全国各地已普遍减价，保证了主要副食品的充分供应以及节前市场的完全稳定。上海市因为有些地方发生猪口蹄疫，禁止四乡活猪贩运入市，准备了市内现有活猪及冷藏猪肉共五万五千头供应市民，此外，还有出口冷藏猪作为后备力量。鸡、鱼的鲜、冻货也大批应市。除糯米正在赶运外，其余主要副食品已经保证供应。北京各国营公司及合作社、私商除已储备大量猪、牛外，并陆续运来羊七千只。各行业在讨论春节供应会议中，私商表示保证蔬菜和糕点的供应。天津在减价前三日曾组织调查小组，进行重点检查，当时稍感不足的苹果，现已由东北运来三火车登市供应。其他如沈阳、重庆、西安、武汉、广州等地一般地都已满足市民需要，保证了春节副食品的供应工作。
