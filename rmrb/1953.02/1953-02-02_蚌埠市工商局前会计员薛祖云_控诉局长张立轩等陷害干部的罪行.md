Bengbu City Industrial and Commercial Bureau's former accountant Xue Zuyun
Accuses Bureau Chief Zhang Lixuan and others of framing cadres

Editor's Note: In late December last year, reader Yang Qihua wrote a letter exposing the crimes of Zhang Lixuan, director of the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce in Anhui, and others, who conspired to frame revolutionary cadre Xue Zuyun. This newspaper immediately wrote to Anhui Daily asking them to take charge of the investigation, and wrote to Xue Zuyun, asking her to boldly file her complaint. Anhui Daily has already published Xue Zuyun's letter of accusation on January 28th, and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is investigating and handling it. Now we are publishing Xue Zuyun's letter of accusation here.

Comrade Editor:

My name is Xue Zuyun. I am a member of the Communist Youth League. I was subjected to retaliation and framed by Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhu Kang, and others from the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, and was arrested and imprisoned for a year and two months. Now, I am exposing the process of being framed to the Party newspaper, requesting justice, urging relevant parties to promptly investigate, punish the masterminds who framed me, and educate other derelict personnel and bureaucrats.

I am from Xueji, Huoqiu County, 23 years old, with a landlord family background and a student background. In the spring of 1948, I graduated from Zhengyang Women's Normal School. In the autumn of the same year, I taught at Tianjia'an Central Primary School. In June 1949, I applied to the Bengbu City Cadre School. In October, I was admitted as a member of the Communist Youth League, and at the end of October, I started working at the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce. When I first started working at the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, the leadership trusted me and paid attention to helping and nurturing me. All the bureau's seals, proofreading, accounting, cashier, document storage, and even the bureau chief's private seal and signature seal, were all handed over to me to manage. By September 1950, except for the accounting work which was transferred to others, the seals, proofreading, and archive work were still my responsibility. This continued until March 1951, when I was transferred to the Industrial Section of the Administration for Industry and Commerce to do internal affairs work.

In the spring of 1950, Gong Yunjia, the head of the Commercial Section of the Administration for Industry and Commerce (formerly a Communist Party member, expelled from the Party for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign and sentenced to labor reform), proposed marriage to me, but I refused. That night, he took the opportunity to molest me, but I sternly rebuked him. He was a married man and a leading cadre, and this behavior was truly vile. I reported this situation to the bureau's leadership. At that time, the bureau chief was Yu Zhixin. The bureau's leadership and the Party branch criticized Gong Yunjia, and the Party gave him a disciplinary sanction. As a result, Gong Yunjia harbored considerable resentment towards me.

Zhu Kang (Party branch secretary), the head of the Industrial Section, had a wife named Ge Renwan who was an alternate member of the Youth League. In the summer of 1950, she requested to become a full member. At that time, I was the organization committee member of the League, and I and most of the League members believed that Ge's ideology was backward and her performance was not good, so she should not be immediately made a full member. After discussions by the League branch committee and the League branch general meeting, everyone disagreed with her becoming a full member and decided to extend Ge's probationary period by three months. Because Zhu Kang was eager to marry Ge, he forcibly passed Ge Renwan's becoming a full member in the name of the Party branch, and as a result, he was extremely dissatisfied with me.

Yang Zhenzhong (Party member, member of the Party branch committee), head of the Commercial Section of the bureau, had always been jealous of me and often attacked me. Because I was in charge of sealing and other work in the bureau, I was able to abide by the rules and not give him convenience, so he was very dissatisfied with me, saying that I was a new cadre and not qualified to manage these things, and even satirized me. Especially in the summer of 1950, he had a mosquito net but also asked to be issued one. According to the regulations, I opposed it, so he harbored even more resentment towards me and made things difficult for me in every way. For example, he told the stall management office not to submit the plan to me (the plan was under the leadership of the Administration for Industry and Commerce, and I was the accountant), as a result, the bank did not give money, which made me go through many procedures and also affected the work. In January 1951, Liu Dong, a section chief in the bureau, also proposed marriage to me, but I politely refused. In the same month, Bureau Chief Yu Zhixin talked to me, saying that I was politically progressive, ideologically pure, and worked actively, and was a promising young person. He was preparing to introduce me to the newly transferred Bureau Chief Zhang Lixuan as a partner. I immediately expressed my opposition. Yu repeatedly tried to convince me, saying that Zhang was an old comrade and the organization should help him solve his marriage problem, and that Zhang "could help me make progress," "age doesn't matter," and so on. Because Zhang's ideology and character were not good, I firmly disagreed, so Zhang became dissatisfied with me.

When the above situation happened one after another, my emotions fluctuated greatly, and I repeatedly requested a transfer, but the leading comrades did not allow it. Then, I suffered a series of attacks and retaliations. For example, on January 14, 1951, Zhu Hao, the head of the secretariat section of the bureau, asked me to talk, saying that in the winter of 1950, during a power outage in Bengbu, Comrade Zhao Chengguang's clothes and badge were stolen, and that I was not in the bureau that day, so I was suspected. This made me extremely angry. Because that night, I was in the bureau, and the female comrade Chang Yiqing, who lived in the same place, was in the dormitory and did not go out. At that time, I reported the facts and presented a witness. Afterwards, I realized that because of the marriage problem, I kept offending people, and something unexpected might happen if I didn't solve it. In February 1951, I took leave to go to Susong (because my brother died) and passed through Hefei. Through the introduction of Zhao Kai, director of the former Wanbei Administrative Office Transportation Department, and others, I established a relationship with Comrade Du ×× of the Administrative Office. On April 8, 1951, Comrade Du ×× went to Beijing to attend a meeting and passed through Bengbu to see me. After this matter was known to the leading cadres of the Administration for Industry and Commerce, it caused great dissatisfaction with Zhang Lixuan and others. Yang Zhenzhong, the head of the Commercial Section, took back the account books that I had transferred and reimbursed from the Finance Bureau (I transferred them in September 1950), assigned some people to conduct an investigation, and held a general meeting of all staff members of the organization on the evening of April 17 to fight against me, saying that there were the following reasons:

1.  One of the accountants before me, due to unfamiliarity with the business, did not include the 600,000 yuan in cash paid for the construction of the stall management office in the cash account. Therefore, from the account, the number she transferred was 600,000 yuan less than the number I received. They immediately thought I was suspected of corruption. I protested at the time, pointing out that Wang Zhijun from the stall management office and Wang Peifang, the accountant who handed over to me, could prove it, but they ignored it (this point had already been proven by Wang and others).

2.  In the past, the bank already had the Industrial and Commercial Bureau's deposit account, which I didn't know or understand. When I accepted the accounting work and continued to deposit money into the bank, I found that there was a deposit of 730,000 yuan in the past. After consulting with Liu Dong, the business instructor, I transferred this money to the transfer subject income. They thought this was suspicious, and I also said that someone could prove it.

3.  In March 1950, the accounting method was changed. I was not familiar with the new method, and the accounts were a bit messy and had errors, but there was a statement of income and expenditure that could prove that there was no corruption, and it was also a formal transfer procedure, and no corruption was found. They also seized on this point as an excuse to frame me.

Especially the following point, they even regarded it as an important handle for framing me.

4.  Li Yongduo, the accountant of the stall management office under the Administration for Industry and Commerce, pre-collected funds in January 1950. When I checked the accounts in February, I found that he had embezzled 1.75 million yuan without reporting it. I immediately questioned him, and he begged me, saying that if the Administration for Industry and Commerce found out, he would be fired, and his family had an old mother and children, and their lives were difficult, so he asked me to hide it for him and promised to return it within a few days. By the time the return date arrived, he had not paid it off. Then, financial and economic unification was implemented, and I was afraid that Zhang and others would take the opportunity to attack me, so I had no choice but to borrow a gold ring from a classmate to make up for it. After Yang Zhenzhong and others checked the accounts, they falsely accused me of corruption. I reasoned with them, but he said that I was using flowery words to deceive the masses.

At this struggle meeting, after a few people, such as Yang Zhenzhong and Gong Yunjia, made attacking comments, Zhang Lixuan, the director of the Administration for Industry and Commerce, announced that I would be sent to the court for compulsory reflection. He also said that the confusion in my accounts was not the main thing (of course it was not the main thing, and there was no problem. Because all the doubts in my accounts were explained, and there were people and facts to prove it, and it was a formal transfer and reimbursement procedure), and that covering up Li Yongduo's embezzlement of public funds was the main thing.

After I was sent to the court, the court said that I had serious political problems. I then knew that they were using the corruption issue as an excuse to achieve the purpose of politically framing me, and I was even more indignant.

The next day, the Bengbu Municipal Court put me in handcuffs and took me for interrogation. Before the court interrogated me for ten minutes, the security section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau came to interrogate me again. In this way, I was falsely accused of being a serious political prisoner. Each interrogation was from 7:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. Every time I was interrogated, I reported the inside story before my arrest to them and requested investigation and handling. But they insisted that I was a spy, and said that this was related to my brother (my brother's name is Xue Zuxian, working in Chenhan District, Susong County, and has died of illness). They also said that the situation of my spy activities had been made into a card, forcing me to admit that I was a spy. I repeatedly denied it and waited for the Party and the government to finally clarify the facts.

On July 5, 1951, the Bengbu Municipal Public Security Bureau escorted me to the Wanbei Court. Judge Meng Zimin interrogated me. This time, I reported the situation of being retaliated against and framed to him and asked for prompt handling. I was very happy to be sent to the Wanbei Court for handling, because I believed that the higher-level court would quickly clarify the matter. But I didn't know that it would drag on for four months without any interrogation. It was not until October 24, 1951, that the second interrogation began. The second interrogation was not as vague as the first interrogation, and it clearly stated that I had a corruption problem. It was said that the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce had materials to prove that I had serious corruption behavior and wanted to send me back to Bengbu. I was afraid that I would be framed even more after returning to Bengbu, so I requested to be handled in Wanbei and asked for the account books of the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce to be transferred. By December, the Wanbei Court transferred the account books and transferred the former accountant Wang Peifang and the later accountants Gong Xin and Hu Diao, but the most important transfer form and related various forms were refused by the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce. Therefore, it was still impossible to judge whether there was a corruption problem. I urged the Wanbei Court to continue to pursue the relevant materials. The Wanbei Court made long-distance calls and sent official letters, asking the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce to submit all relevant materials. However, Zhang Lixuan and others from the Bengbu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce still did not submit important materials, deliberately dragging me into prison. On May 31, 1952, the Wanbei Public Security Bureau came to interrogate me. At that time, I felt strange, why was I always being transferred back and forth between the court and the public security bureau. I knew that this time Zhu, the section chief of the Wanbei Public Security Bureau's reconnaissance section, said to me: "We are preparing to release you, do you have any opinions?" I raised an opinion, and he said: "Don't talk nonsense about being wronged after you go out. Some people go to the reactionary side like this." On June 2, the court interrogated me again, and the judge Meng Zimin told me: "Your case has been judged!" Then he began to read the judgment, and the opening was "Corruption Criminal Xue Zuyun". I immediately protested, but he ignored me and continued to read the judgment, saying that I covered up Li Yongduo's embezzlement of 1.75 million yuan of public funds. I immediately raised the question: "Since someone else embezzled public funds, even if I covered it up, how can it be said that I am corrupt?" He said: "This is a matter of wording by the trial committee." Then he sentenced me to six months in prison, which was offset by the time I had been detained before. I asked for a new judgment, but he said: "If you are not satisfied, you can appeal to East China!" I raised an opinion again, and he announced: "I am retiring from the court!" I said: "You are retiring from the court, where am I going?" He said: "Where you go, I can't control." Helpless, I had to take a few pieces of broken clothes and quilts to the Wanbei Democratic Women's Federation. The responsible comrades of the Women's Federation listened to my report and attached great importance to it, so they asked the relevant parties to reinvestigate and handle it. After being released from prison, my League membership and work were restored, and the court also revoked the wrong judgment. But the bad guys Zhang Lixuan, Zhu Kang, Yang Zhenzhong, etc., who framed and retaliated against me, are still at large. I demand that they be severely punished. The reasons why I accuse them of framing me are as follows:

1. Since they thought I had political problems, why did they hold a mass meeting to fight against me, and arrest me in the name of corruption? My economic accounts have been investigated several times and no corruption has been found. Even more noteworthy is that they were eager to arrest me before the investigation was concluded, which was obviously retaliation.

2. Since they had long suspected me politically, why did Zhang Lixuan still propose marriage to me through Yu Zhixin in January 1951, and call me to take on important work such as managing seals for a long time?

3. They suspect that I have political problems, saying that the people I am close to and my brother have problems. Since they have problems, why not clarify their political situation first, but arrest me first?

4. Zhang Lixuan decided to arrest me after returning from a meeting in Hefei. When he was in Hefei for the meeting, the Industrial and Commercial Office had proposed to transfer me to the province, and told him that I was already in a relationship with Du ××. Since they had long suspected me, why did they decide to arrest me at this time? Isn't this intentional framing?

5. Even if they suspected that I had political problems, there was no sufficient material, why did they arrest me? Even if I was suspected, I should have clarified it first. They should understand this in policy.

6. Since they said they suspected me of political suspicion, why didn't they continue to investigate and clarify the facts for a long time after the arrest, deliberately delaying it? Moreover, they adopted vicious delaying tactics on my so-called corruption problem, deliberately not submitting important materials, so that this problem was difficult to conclude for a long time. This is obviously intentional framing.

7. Why did they take the words out of context in the letters written to me by my brother and others, and extract them as counter-revolutionary evidence? This is of course creating excuses to achieve the purpose of personal framing.

In addition, after I was arrested, I appealed to the Bengbu Municipal Court, the Public Security Bureau, and the Wanbei Court, telling them the inside story of the framing. Why didn't they listen to my appeal and promptly investigate and handle it, causing me to be detained in prison for a long time? After I was arrested, I also wrote a letter to Liu Dong, the secretary of the League branch, asking for investigation and handling. Why didn't they ask the relevant parties to pay attention to the investigation?

I especially request the relevant parties to arrest and bring to justice the main criminals who framed me, Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhu Kang, etc., and severely punish them to educate the broad masses of cadres.

Sincerely,

Xue Zuyun

    蚌埠市工商局前会计员薛祖云
    控诉局长张立轩等陷害干部的罪行
    编者按：去年十二月底，读者杨琪华来信，揭露安徽蚌埠市工商局长张立轩等阴谋陷害革命干部薛祖云的罪行。本报当即写信给安徽日报请他们负责调查，并写信给薛祖云，要她大胆控诉。安徽日报已在一月二十八日将薛祖云控诉信刊出，中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会正查究处理。现在我们把薛祖云的控诉信公布在这里。编辑同志：
    我叫薛祖云，是一个青年团员，被蚌埠市工商局张立轩、杨振中、朱抗等打击报复，阴谋陷害，并将我逮捕监禁达一年两个月之久。现在我将被陷害的经过向党报揭发，请求主持正义，督促有关方面迅速查明，惩办陷害的主谋人，并教育其他失职人员和官僚主义分子。
    我是霍邱县薛集人，现年二十三岁，地主成分，学生出身。一九四八年春，我在正阳女子师范毕业，当年秋到田家庵中心小学教书，一九四九年六月投考蚌埠市干部学校，十月份被发展为青年团员，十月底到蚌埠市工商局工作。我刚到蚌埠市工商局工作时，领导上对我是信任的，也注意对我的帮助和培养，所有局内印鉴、校对、会计、出纳、资料保管，甚至局长私章和签名章，统交我负责管理。到一九五○年九月，除会计工作移交给他人外，印鉴、校对和档案工作，仍由我负责。直到一九五一年三月，调到工商局工业科做内勤工作。
    一九五○年春，工商局商业科科长龚允佳（原为共产党员，在“三反”中因贪污问题已被开除党籍，并被判徒刑劳动改造。）向我提出婚姻问题，被我拒绝。当晚，他又借机对我调戏，被我严词斥责。他是有妇之夫，又是领导干部，这种行为实在恶劣。我就把这个情况向局的领导同志反映。当时局长为余志新，局的领导同志和党支部都对龚允佳进行了批评，党内并给以处分。因此，龚允佳对我颇为怀恨。
    工业科科长朱抗（党支部书记）的爱人葛仁婉是候补团员，她在一九五○年夏天要求转正。当时我是团的组织委员，我和团内绝大部分同志，都认为葛思想落后，表现不好，不能马上转正。后经团支委会、团支部大会讨论的结果，都不同意转正，决定给葛延长候补期三个月。朱抗因为要急于和葛结婚，竟以党支部名义强制团支部通过葛仁婉转正，并因此对我极为不满。
    局内商业科科长杨振中（党员、党支部委员），他一贯对我忌恨，而且时常打击我。因为我在局内担任的是监印等工作，我能遵守制度，不给他方便，他就对我大为不满，说我是新干部，没有资格管这些东西，甚至还讽刺我。特别是一九五○年夏天，他有蚊帐也要求发帐子，我按照规定，提出反对，因此他对我更加怀恨，处处和我为难。如他叫摊贩管理所不把计划交给我（该所属工商局领导，我是会计），结果银行不给钱，使我费了许多手续，还影响了工作。一九五一年一月，局内股长柳东又向我提出婚姻问题，也被我婉言拒绝。同一月内，局长余志新找我谈话，说我政治上比较开展，思想纯洁，工作积极，是有前途的青年，准备把我介绍给新调来的局长张立轩作爱人，我当即表示反对。余又再三给我打通思想，说张是老同志，组织上应该帮助他解决婚姻问题，并说张“可以多帮助我进步”，“年纪大不要紧”等等。我因张思想品质不好，坚决不同意，因此，张就对我不满。
    当上述情况接连发生后，我的情绪很波动，再三提出要求调动工作，领导同志都未允许。接着，我就遭到了一连串的打击、报复。如：一九五一年一月十四日，局内秘书科科长朱浩找我去谈话，说在一九五○年冬，有一次蚌市停电时，局内赵诚光同志的衣服证章被偷，说那天我不在局内，有嫌疑。这使我气愤极了。因为那天夜里，我是在局内的，而且和同住一处的女同志常一清，都在宿舍内，并未外出。当时我据实报告，并提出证人。事后，我发觉因为婚姻问题，老是得罪人，会发生意外，再不解决不行了。在一九五一年二月间，我请假去宿松（因哥哥死了）路过合肥，经前皖北行署交通处长赵凯等介绍，我和行署杜××同志建立恋爱关系。一九五一年四月八日，杜××同志去北京开会，路过蚌埠看我。这事被工商局领导干部知道后，就引起张立轩等大为不满。商业科科长杨振中，就到财政局把我早经移交、报销过的账册拿回（我是
    一九五○年九月移交的），指派一些人进行清查，并在四月十七日晚，召开机关全体人员大会，向我进行斗争，说有下面几点理由：
    一、在我以前的一个会计，因业务生疏，把付摊贩管理所建筑费现金六十万元，未列入现金账，因此从账面上看：她的移交数比我接受数少六十万元。他们即认为我有贪污嫌疑。我当时曾提出抗议，指明摊贩管理所王志军和交给我的会计王佩芳可证明，但他们不加理睬（这一点，早经王等证明过）。
    二、过去银行已有工商局的存款户头，我不知道也不懂得。当我接受会计工作，并继续向银行存款后，发现过去有存款七十三万元，经请示业务指导人柳东，将这笔款转为移交科目收入。他们认为这一点可疑，我也提出有人可证明。
    三、一九五○年三月，改变记账方法，我对新方法不熟悉，账有些乱，并有错误，但有收支对照表可证实没有贪污行为，而且经过正式移交手续，未发现贪污。他们也抓住这一点，作为陷害借口。
    特别是下面一点，他们更加当做陷害的重要把柄。
    四、工商局所属摊贩管理所会计李永铎，一九五○年一月间，预领经费。至二月查账时，我发现他挪用一百七十五万元未报。我当即向他追问，他向我求情，说工商局如发现了会把他开除，他家中有老母、小孩，生活困难，求我替他瞒住，并答应日内归还。到了归还日期，他又未还清，紧接着实行财经统一，我又怕张等发现后乘机打击，无可奈何，我向同学借金戒子一个垫上。这事在杨振中等查账后，反诬我贪污，我据理申辩，他又说我花言巧语蒙蔽群众。
    在这一斗争会上，经杨振中、龚允佳等少数人发表打击性意见以后，即由工商局局长张立轩宣布将我送法院强制反省。并说：我账上的错乱，都不是主要的（当然不是主要的，而且是无问题的。因为我账上所有疑问，都有交代，有人和事实可证，并且是经过正式移交、报销手续的），而包庇李永铎挪用公款是主要的。
    我被送至法院后，法院说我有严重政治问题，我才知他们是以贪污问题为借口，对我达到政治上陷害的目的，我就更加愤慨。
    第二天，蚌埠市法院就给我带上手铐，提去审讯。由法院提讯不到十分钟，市公安局保卫科又来提讯，这样我就被诬陷为严重的政治犯。每次审讯都在下午七时至夜十二时、一时。每次审讯时，我都把被捕前的内幕情况，向他们报告，请求查处。但他们硬说我是特务，并说这是和我哥哥有联系的
    （我哥哥叫薛祖贤，在宿松县陈汉区工作，已病死）。他们还说我做特务活动的情形，已被他们制成卡片，强迫我承认是特务。我再三否认，并等待着党和政府最后弄清事实。
    一九五一年七月五日，由蚌埠市公安局把我解到皖北法院，审判员孟子皿把我提讯。这次我又把被报复陷害的情况，向他报告，并要求迅速处理。我对解来皖北法院处理，是很高兴的，因为我相信上级法院一定会把事情很快弄清。那知道一拖四个月，都未审讯。直到一九五一年十月二十四日，才开始第二次审讯。第二次审讯时，已经不像第一次审讯那样含糊，明确提出我是贪污问题。说：市工商局有材料，证明我有严重的贪污行为，要解我回蚌埠。我怕到蚌市后，更遭陷害，请求在皖北处理，并要求将蚌市工商局账册调来。到十二月份，皖北法院将账册调来，并将前会计王佩芳，后会计龚忻、胡雕等三人调来，但是最主要的移交表和有关的各种表格，蚌市工商局拒不交来。因此，是否有贪污问题，仍无法判断。我就催促皖北法院，继续追调有关材料。皖北法院即打长途电话、去公函，要蚌市工商局把有关材料全部交来。但是蚌市工商局张立轩等，仍然不交重要材料，故意把我拖在监狱中。一九五二年五月三十一日，皖北公安局来提讯。当时我感到奇怪，为什么老是在法院、公安局转来转去。那知道这一次皖北公安局侦察科朱科长对我说：“我们准备释放你了，你有意见没有？”我提出意见，他又说：“出去以后不要乱说冤枉。有些人就是这样走向反动方面去的。”六月二日，法院又将我提讯，审判人孟子皿告诉我说：“你的案子判决啦！”于是他就开始宣读判决书，一开口就是“贪污犯薛祖云”。我当即提出抗议，他不理睬，继续宣读判决书，说我包庇李永铎挪用公款一百七十五万元。我即提出：“既然是他人挪用公款，即使是我包庇的，何能说是我贪污？”他说：“这是审判委员会的用语问题。”于是判我徒刑六个月，以以前关押时间来抵折。我要求重新判决，他就说：“不服可到华东打上诉！”我再提意见，他就宣布说：“我退堂了！”我说：“你到退堂了，我又到那里去呢？”他说：“你到那里去，我可管不着。”无可奈何，我只好带了几件破衣服、棉被等，到皖北民主妇联会去，妇联负责同志听了我的报告，很重视，就要求有关方面重新调查处理。出狱后，我的团籍和工作都恢复了，法院也撤销了那个错误判决。但是对我进行陷害报复的坏蛋张立轩、朱抗、杨振中等，还逍遥法外，我要求对他们进行严厉的制裁。我所以提出他们陷害我的理由如下：
    一、既然认为我有政治问题，为何又召开群众大会向我进行斗争，而且以贪污为名，将我逮捕。我的经济账目，几次清查都未发现我有贪污行为；更加值得注意的是，查账后还未做结论，就急于将我逮捕，这显然是报复。
    二、既然对我政治上早有怀疑，为什么到一九五一年一月份，张立轩还通过余志新介绍，向我提出婚姻问题，而且长期间都叫我担负管理印鉴等重要工作。
    三、他们怀疑我政治上有问题，是说我接近的人和我哥哥有问题，既然是他们有问题，为何不先弄清他们的政治情况，而先逮捕我。
    四、张立轩是在合肥开会回去以后，决定逮捕我的。他在合肥开会时，工商处已提出要调我来省，而且告诉他，我已与杜××有恋爱关系。既然是早就怀疑我，为什么恰恰在这个时候，决定逮捕我，这不是有意陷害是什么。
    五、即使怀疑我有政治问题，但是没有任何足够的材料，为什么要逮捕我？就算我是有嫌疑吧，有嫌疑也该先弄清楚，他们在政策上应该是懂得这一点的。
    六、既然说是怀疑我有政治嫌疑，为什么逮捕后，长时间内不继续追查，弄清事实，故意拖延。而且对我的所谓贪污问题更采取恶毒的拖延手段，故意不交重要材料，以致这一问题长期内难做结论，这显然是故意陷害。
    七、我哥哥等人写给我的信，在这些信中有些话，他们为什么断章取义，摘出作为反革命证据，这当然是制造借口，达到个人陷害的目的。
    此外，我在被捕之后，曾向蚌埠市法院、公安局和皖北法院提出申诉，告诉他们陷害的内幕情形，他们为什么不听我的申诉，迅速调查处理，使我长期关押在狱。我在被捕后也曾给团支部书记柳东写信，要求调查处理，他们又为什么不提请有关方面注意调查。
    我特别要求有关方面，把陷害我的主犯张立轩、杨振中、朱抗等逮捕法办，严厉惩处，以教育广大干部。此致敬礼！
