Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 21st: The Berlin evening newspaper "Nacht-Express" published a message from Bonn on the 18th, stating that American staff officers who recently came to West Germany said that one of the main reasons for Van Fleet's recent dismissal was because he leaked important classified information.... As early as last July, it became known that Van Fleet had said to Chevalier, head of the Belgian delegation in Tokyo, that Van Fleet publicly admitted in this conversation that the US military in Korea had used bacteriological weapons against North Korea.

Van Fleet was severely reprimanded by Washington for leaking this important classified information.

According to conversations with an American officer who recently visited Japan, news of the large-scale production of bacteriological weapons organized by the US Eighth Army headquarters and Clark's headquarters has become widespread in Tokyo. Specifically, the fact that the US Eighth Army Unit 406, stationed in Tokyo under the guise of a health department, is engaged in the production of bacteriological weapons is no longer a secret.

An investigation conducted by a group from the US Joint Chiefs of Staff revealed that Van Fleet's headquarters did not take the necessary confidentiality measures for the production of bacteriological weapons. For example, employees of Unit 406, stationed in Tokyo, transported corpses and specimens with bacteria out of the health center completely undisguised. The laboratory responsible for leading this health center is run by the nephew of Shiro Ishii, a Japanese bacteriologist who studies how to cultivate deadly new bacteria. The American side does not conceal this.

Officers at Van Fleet's headquarters also cooperated with Ozawa in the work of Unit 406. Ozawa is the director of the "Japanese Experimental Animal" Science Institute in Kasukabe (Saitama Prefecture, Japan), and he is a Liberal Party member of the Saitama Prefectural Assembly.

In addition, Van Fleet was also reprimanded because he allowed his headquarters to transport corpses of North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who died from bacterial experiments from Korea completely undisguised, and transported these corpses to Ozawa's "Institute" in Kasukabe and to the laboratory run by Shiro Ishii's nephew in Tokyo. Employees of Unit 406 of the US Eighth Army hardly followed any confidentiality regulations when sending insects carrying deadly bacteria from Ozawa's "Institute" to be subsequently taken by American aircraft to be scattered over North Korea and China.

### 美军在日本制造细菌武器罪行进一步暴露

    美军在日本制造细菌武器罪行进一步暴露
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社柏林十九日讯：柏林晚报“每夜快报”在十八日刊载了一则从波恩发来的消息。消息说：最近从美国来到西德的美国参谋军官们说，范佛里特最近被撤职的主要原因之一是由于他泄漏了重要的秘密情报……。远在去年七月的时候，外间就知道了范佛里特对比利时驻东京使团团长薛瓦勒里所说的话，范佛里特在这次谈话里曾公开承认在朝鲜的美军对北朝鲜使用了细菌武器。
    由于泄露了这个重要的秘密情报，范佛里特受到了华盛顿方面的严厉斥责。
    根据最近到过日本的一个美国军官的谈话，美国第八军总部和克拉克总部组织了大量的细菌武器生产的消息已在东京普遍流传。具体地说，假借卫生部门的招牌驻在东京的美国第八军四零六处正在从事细菌武器生产的事实，已不再是什么秘密了。
    由美国参谋本部的一批人所进行的调查表明：范佛里特总部没有采取为进行细菌武器生产所必需的保密措施。譬如说，驻在东京的四零六处的雇员们完全不加掩盖地把带有细菌的尸体和标本运出卫生所去。负责领导这个卫生所的实验室的，是日本的细菌学家、研究如何培养致人死命的新细菌的石井四郎的侄子。而对于这一点，美国方面也不加掩饰。
    范佛里特总部的军官们在四零六处的工作方面并取得小泽的合作。小泽是粕壁（在日本埼玉县）“日本实验动物”科学研究所所长，他是埼玉县县议会的自由党议员。
    此外，范佛里特还受到斥责，因为他允许他的总部完全不遮掩地从朝鲜运来那些由于受到细菌试验而死亡的北朝鲜和中国战俘的尸体，并且把这些尸体运到粕壁的小泽的“研究所”和石井四郎的侄子在东京所办的实验室去。美国第八军四零六处的雇员们在把带有致命细菌的昆虫从小泽的“研究所”送出去以便接着由美国飞机带往北朝鲜和中国上空散布时，他们几乎没有遵守任何保密条例。
