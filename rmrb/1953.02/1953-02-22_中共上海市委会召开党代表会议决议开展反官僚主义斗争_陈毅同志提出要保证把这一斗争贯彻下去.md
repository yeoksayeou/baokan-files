Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 21st. The Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Municipal Committee held its first Party Congress from January 28th to February 7th. At this meeting, in a spirit of fully promoting democracy and conducting criticism and self-criticism, the work of 1952 was summarized and the work tasks for 1953 were discussed. Based on the CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Opposing Bureaucracy, Opposing Commandism, and Opposing Violations of Law and Discipline" and the East China Bureau's decision on the "Huang Yifeng Incident," the representatives thoroughly exposed and criticized various phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, especially the anti-Party tendency of people like Huang Yifeng who regarded the units they led as "independent kingdoms." The meeting also resolved to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in a guided, planned, and step-by-step manner throughout the city.

Chen Yi, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, delivered a political report at the meeting. He made a profound analysis of the current domestic and international political situation and gave a detailed explanation of the three central tasks of the country this year. Chen Yi conveyed the CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Opposing Bureaucracy, Opposing Commandism, and Opposing Violations of Law and Discipline" and profoundly analyzed the erroneous nature and lessons of the "Huang Yifeng Incident." He pointed out that the nature of Huang Yifeng's mistakes was anti-Party and anti-people. Huang Yifeng regarded the unit that the Party and the people entrusted to him to lead as an "independent kingdom," treated the Party members and masses working in the unit under his leadership as his "subjects," and attempted to use this as a tool for him to resist the Party's leadership and oppress the people. He regarded his history and position as a deposit and safe in a bank, mistakenly believing that the Party could not treat him differently, and that he could freely do whatever he wanted. Chen Yi emphasized that such bad elements as Huang Yifeng were not isolated cases in our Shanghai Party organization, but existed in a batch; we must bring these bad elements into the sunlight, completely dissolve their "independent kingdoms," and resolutely remove those elements who have committed serious crimes in their current work and who have repeatedly made mistakes in history and are incorrigible from the Party. Only in this way can we maintain the purity of the Party, strengthen the Party's ties with the broad masses, and mobilize and organize the broad masses to realize the tasks of 1953. Chen Yi concluded by saying: Our work has been successful, but this Party Congress should not be a venue for self-praise, but must be a platform for boldly and sharply criticizing shortcomings. Every representative attending this meeting has full freedom to criticize any department or any Party member, including members of the Municipal Party Committee and the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. He called on the representatives to hold the Party Congress in this spirit, so as to promote the Shanghai Party organization to fight for new and greater victories.

After Chen Yi's report, Chen Pixian, Fourth Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, made a report on "Summary of Shanghai's Work in 1952 and Main Work in 1953." In his report, he first pointed out that although there were still shortcomings and errors of varying degrees in Shanghai's work over the past year, the expected tasks have basically been completed. He summarized the achievements, shortcomings, and lessons learned in various reform and transformation work, financial and economic work, and Party building work in the past year. In summarizing the part of Party building work, Chen Pixian emphasized that the Party's ideological education work is still far from being done well enough, and has not yet regarded ideological leadership as the Party's primary task and the main link of leadership. There are still "independent kingdom" thoughts in our Party, as well as suppression of criticism, lack of organization and discipline, coercive orders, and even serious violations of law and discipline such as beating and detaining the masses, and forcing people to death. According to the tasks of the people and the Party throughout the country in 1953 and the specific situation in Shanghai, Chen Pixian pointed out that in 1953, Shanghai must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and mobilize manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Korean front; it must further mobilize the masses, give full play to the potential strength of all parties, increase production, practice thrift, complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state, and resolutely obey unified allocation and serve the overall plan of national construction; it must strengthen the construction of people's democratic politics, hold the people's congresses at the municipal and district levels well, and welcome the National People's Congress; it must strive to basically complete the outstanding reform and transformation work in 1953 to meet the needs of national construction. Chen Pixian finally pointed out that closely combining various tasks and resolutely and deeply carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline is the basic key to whether the tasks this year can be successfully completed.

The biggest feature of this meeting was that it fully promoted democracy and carried out criticism and self-criticism. In four days of group discussions and two days of plenary meetings, various phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline were exposed and criticized. The spearhead of criticism was first directed at the anti-Party tendency of people like Huang Yifeng who regarded the units they led as "independent kingdoms." Representatives of the Jiangning District Committee, the Party Committee of the Industrial Bureau, and the Zhabei District Committee exposed and criticized the serious mistakes of Su Bo, former Secretary of the Jiangning District Committee, Liu Jigan, Manager of Shanghai Tobacco Company, and Su Feng, Secretary of the Zhabei District Committee, in resisting leadership, suppressing democracy, and acting like overlords in the units they led. The meeting made preliminary exposures and criticisms of some unhealthy phenomena in the Party, such as the relatively common lack of organizational and disciplinary character, and the shortcomings and errors of many cadres in their work style that deviated from the masses and reality; and solemnly criticized the lack of ideological struggle and weak political principles of some Party organizations and Party leading cadres, and their erroneous attitude of liberalism and reconciliation and appeasement towards phenomena that harm the interests of the Party and the masses; the meeting also exposed the fairly widespread and serious phenomena of coercive orders and violations of law and discipline in grassroots organizations and among grassroots cadres.

After full discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed with Chen Yi's political report and Chen Pixian's work report, and guaranteed to implement the spirit of these two reports in future practical work. The representatives unanimously supported the CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Opposing Bureaucracy, Opposing Commandism, and Opposing Violations of Law and Discipline" and the East China Bureau's decision on handling the Huang Yifeng incident; and guaranteed that under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, they would carry out this struggle in a guided, planned, and step-by-step manner and closely combined with various tasks in their own work departments.

Chen Pixian made a summary of the meeting. He pointed out that through this meeting, the ideological and leadership levels of leading cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Party organization will be greatly improved, and criticism and self-criticism will be greatly developed. He asked the representatives to deeply convey the spirit and resolutions of this Party Congress, closely combine various tasks, study and discuss the various documents of the "Huang Yifeng Incident" and Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, start from examining and summarizing work, start from examining and handling letters from the people, fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, and victoriously launch the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and make it deeply and persistently implemented.

After the meeting passed the resolution, Chen Yi delivered a closing speech. He said: The gains of this meeting are great. Our criticism and self-criticism have developed, and the democratic life within the Party has developed. Some comrades who originally did not dare to criticize now dare to criticize; some who originally did not dare to expose now dare to expose; and some comrades with serious problems in their thinking and work style cannot help but be vigilant and cannot help but make self-criticism. We must implement this spirit in our regular work, so that criticism and self-criticism become a regular system and a trend. Only in this way can the cause of our Party continue to advance, the shortcomings and errors in our work be reduced, the Party's policies be correctly implemented, and the tasks be successfully completed. To those who suppress criticism, we must treat them as the mortal enemies of the Party and launch a relentless struggle against them. For those who are particularly serious and bad, we must resolutely cleanse them. We have passed a resolution to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in a guided, planned, and step-by-step manner throughout the city. This is very necessary and correct. However, this struggle is different from last year's "Three-Anti" movement. It is not a problem that can be solved by a sudden attack. We cannot stop the current tasks to carry out this struggle, but we must closely combine this struggle with the current tasks and make it a driving force to promote various tasks. What is particularly important is that this struggle must be carried out in a guided, planned, and step-by-step manner. Only in this way can we ensure that this struggle can be widely, deeply, and persistently implemented, and that the problems can be thoroughly solved. There are many and heavy tasks in 1953. To complete these tasks well, we must improve our leadership methods and work style. We must replace bureaucratic work methods with methods of conducting in-depth investigations and research, and timely inspecting and summarizing work; we must replace coercive command methods with methods of repeatedly explaining policies and implementing the mass line. The tasks of 1953 are arduous, but also glorious. Let us further unite and strive to complete the tasks of 1953 under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee, and the East China Bureau!

Those who attended the Party Congress were members of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, members of the CPC Shanghai District Committees, and representatives of Party organizations at all levels, totaling five hundred and fifty-one; one hundred and seventy-one people attended as nonvoting delegates.

    中共上海市委会召开党代表会议决议开展反官僚主义斗争
    陈毅同志提出要保证把这一斗争贯彻下去
    【新华社上海二十一日电】中国共产党上海市委员会在一月二十八日到二月七日召开了上海市第一次党代表会议。这次会议在充分发扬民主、开展批评与自我批评的精神下，总结了一九五二年的工作，讨论了一九五三年的工作任务。代表们根据中共中央“关于反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的指示”和华东局关于“黄逸峰事件”的决定，深入地揭发与批判了各种官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，特别是批判了类似黄逸峰那种把自己所领导的单位当作“独立王国”的反党倾向。会议并决议在全市范围内有领导、有计划、有步骤地开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。
    中共上海市委第一书记陈毅在会上作了政治报告。他对当前国内外的政治形势作了深刻的分析，并对今年国家的三项中心任务作了详尽的说明。陈毅传达了中共中央“关于反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的指示”，深刻地分析了“黄逸峰事件”的错误性质和教训。他指出：黄逸峰所犯错误的性质，是反党与反人民的。黄逸峰把党与人民交给他去领导的单位当作“独立王国”，把在他领导的单位中工作的党员与群众当作自己的“臣民”，并企图以此作为他对抗党的领导与压迫人民的工具；他把自己的历史和地位当作银行的存款和保险柜，错误地以为党不能不对他另眼看待，而他也就可以自由地为非作歹。陈毅着重指出：像黄逸峰这样的坏分子，在我们上海市党的组织内并不是个别的，而是有一批；我们必须把这些坏分子拉到日光下来，彻底解散他们的“独立王国”，对那些在当前工作中犯有严重罪恶以及在历史上屡犯错误而屡教不改的不可救药的分子，必须坚决地把他们清除出党。只有这样，才能保持党的纯洁性，才能加强党与广大群众的联系，才能动员与组织广大群众来实现一九五三年的任务。陈毅最后说：我们的工作是有成绩的，但这次党代表会议不应成为自我歌颂的场合，而必须成为进行大胆地尖锐地批评缺点的讲台。出席这次会议的每一个代表都有充分的自由可以批评任何一个部门或任何一个党员，包括市委委员和市委书记在内。他号召代表们用这样的精神开好党代表会议，以推动上海的党组织为争取新的更伟大的胜利而斗争。
    陈毅报告后，中共上海市委第四书记陈丕显作了
    “上海市一九五二年工作总结和一九五三年主要工作”的报告。他在报告中首先指出：一年来上海市的各项工作虽然还存在不同程度的缺点与错误，但基本上已完成了预期的任务。他分别总结了过去一年来各项改革改造工作、财政经济工作和党的建设工作的成绩、缺点与经验教训。在总结党的建设工作的部分，陈丕显着重指出：党的思想教育工作至今还是做得很不够的，还没有把思想领导作为党的首要工作和领导的主要环节。在我们的党内还存在着“独立王国”的思想，以及压制批评、无组织无纪律、强迫命令甚至打骂拘押群众、逼死人命等等严重的违法乱纪的现象。陈丕显根据一九五三年全国人民与全党的任务和上海的具体情况，指出：一九五三年上海市必须继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，动员人力、物力和财力支援朝鲜前线；必须进一步发动群众，充分发挥各方面的潜在力量，增加生产、厉行节约，完成与超额完成国家分配给我们的任务，并坚决服从统一调配，为国家建设的总计划服务；必须加强人民民主建政工作，开好市、区两级人民代表大会，迎接全国人民代表大会；必须争取在一九五三年基本上完成各项未了的改革、改造工作，以适应国家建设的需要。陈丕显最后指出：密切结合各项工作，坚决地深入开展反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，乃是今年各项任务能否胜利完成的基本关键。
    这次会议的最大特点是充分地发扬了民主，开展了批评与自我批评，在四天分组讨论和两天全体会议上揭发与批判了各种官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。批评的锋芒首先针对着那种类似黄逸峰的把自己所领导的单位当作“独立国王”的反党倾向。江宁区委代表、工业局党委代表和闸北区委代表揭发与批判了前江宁区委书记苏博、上海烟草公司经理刘积干和闸北区委书记苏峰等对抗领导、压制民主、在自己领导的单位中称王称霸的严重错误。会议对党内某些不健康的现象，如比较普遍的组织性、纪律性不强，以及许多干部工作作风上脱离群众、脱离实际等缺点与错误作了初步的揭发与批判；并对某些党的组织和党的领导干部思想斗争不开展、政治原则性薄弱，对危害党与群众利益的现象采取自由主义和调和姑息的错误态度，作了严肃的批评；会议并揭发了基层组织与基层干部中相当普遍而严重的强迫命令和违法乱纪的现象。
    会议经过充分讨论以后，代表们一致同意陈毅的政治报告和陈丕显的工作报告，并保证将这两个报告的精神贯彻到今后实际工作中去。代表们一致拥护中共中央“关于反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的指示”和华东局处理黄逸峰事件的决定；并保证在市委的统一领导下，在自己的工作部门中有领导、有计划、有步骤地并密切结合各项工作开展这一斗争。
    会议由陈丕显作总结。他指出：经过这次会议，上海党组织各级领导干部的思想和领导水平将会有很大的提高，批评与自我批评将会有很大的开展。他要求代表们深入地传达这次党代表会议的精神与决议，密切结合各项工作，学习和讨论“黄逸峰事件”的各项文件以及马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告，从检查和总结工作入手，从检查和处理人民来信入手，充分地开展批评与自我批评，将反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争胜利地开展起来，并使它深入持久地贯彻下去。
    会议在通过了决议后由陈毅致闭幕词。他说：这次会议的收获是很大的，我们的批评与自我批评发展了，党内的民主生活发展了。有些同志本来不敢批评的，现在敢于批评了；本来不敢揭发的，现在敢于揭发了；某些思想作风上有严重毛病的同志也不能不警惕起来，不能不做检讨了。我们要把这种精神贯彻到经常的工作中去，使批评与自我批评成为一项经常的制度，使它成为一种风气。只有这样，我们党的事业才会不断地前进，工作中的缺点与错误才会减少，党的政策才能正确的贯彻，工作任务才会胜利地完成。对压制批评的人，我们要把他们当做党的死敌，对他们展开无情的斗争。对其中特别严重恶劣的分子，还要坚决地加以清洗。我们通过决议要在全市范围内有领导、有计划、有步骤地展开反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。这是非常必要的、正确的。但是，这一斗争不同于去年的“三反”运动，它不是突击一下就可以解决问题的，我们也不能把当前各项工作停止下来开展这一斗争，而是要把这一斗争和当前各项工作密切结合，使它成为推动各项工作的动力。特别重要的是，这一斗争必须有领导、有计划、有步骤地展开。只有这样，才能保证这一斗争能够广泛、深入、持久地贯彻下去，并能彻底地解决问题。一九五三年的工作任务很多、很重。要很好地完成这些任务，就必须改善我们的领导方法和工作作风。我们要以进行深入地调查研究，及时检查和总结工作的方法来代替官僚主义的工作方法；要以反复交代政策、贯彻群众路线的工作方法来代替强迫命令的工作方法。一九五三年的工作任务是艰巨的，但又是光荣的。让我们更进一步团结起来，在毛泽东同志、党中央和华东局的领导下，为完成一九五三年的任务而奋斗！
    出席这次党代表会议的有中共上海市委员会委员，中共上海市各区委员会委员和各级党组织的代表五百五十一人；列席代表一百七十一人。
