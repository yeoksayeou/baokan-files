    Today's Stalingrad
    By Sergei Shapurov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Stalingrad City Soviet
    Editor's Note: Today marks the tenth anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet army in annihilating the Hitlerite German fascist forces in Stalingrad. We are publishing this article to commemorate this great day.
    Ten years ago, our city was engulfed in the flames of a great battle. The heroic defenders of Stalingrad spared no sacrifice, relentlessly resisting the invading fascist German bandits on the banks of the Volga River. Under the enemy's artillery fire, many tall buildings were destroyed, stones were blasted into powder, and steel-reinforced concrete structures were shattered into fragments, but the heroes of Stalingrad did not retreat a single step from the front line. They fought for the peaceful and happy life of the people. There, they not only stopped the enemy's offensive but also annihilated them.
    In February 1943, when the flames of war had just died down in Stalingrad, what had been a district full of factories and houses before the war was now just a scene of ruins and rubble. All public utilities, such as tap water, drainage equipment, and urban transportation, were completely destroyed, and places that had previously been parks and boulevards had turned into scorched earth riddled with bomb and artillery shell craters.
    I remember that on the wall of a destroyed building, the defenders of Stalingrad left the following sentence: "Stalingrad, we must defend you (Отстоим)." Later, a resident of Stalingrad added a letter to one of the words in this sentence, and thus this sentence became a powerful new slogan: "Stalingrad, we must rebuild you (Отстроим)."
    It was at that time that an American delegation came to visit Stalingrad. After inspecting the destroyed city, journalists from overseas came to the conclusion that it was impossible to rebuild Stalingrad. They thought it would be easier to build a new city on other open ground. These people did not understand how strong our loyalty and love was for the land of Stalingrad, which had been irrigated with the blood of heroes. They also did not understand how huge the creativity and potential of a country where the people themselves held power was.
    During the war years, the entire Soviet state defended Stalingrad, and in the difficult days of rebuilding this heroic city, the entire country came to help the people of Stalingrad. In order to rebuild this glorious city from rubble and ruins, thousands of builders rushed to the banks of the Volga River from all over the Soviet Union. The heroic epic of defending Stalingrad had just ended, and the heroic epic of rebuilding the city began.
    The people who rebuilt Stalingrad greeted the tenth anniversary of the heroic city's victory with amazing contributions to peaceful labor. Today, the heroic city is living vividly and vigorously. Stalingrad has once again become an industrial and cultural center in the southeast of the Soviet Union. It is currently producing excellent tractors, bulldozers, powerful dredging equipment, ships, medical equipment, shoes, clothing, and many other products for the country. The steel produced in Stalingrad plays a huge role in the great communist construction projects. The restored industrial production has greatly exceeded the pre-war level.
    While restoring industry, large-scale construction of housing and cultural institutions was also carried out in the city, and public utilities developed rapidly. In the past few years, in an area extending more than sixty kilometers along the Volga River, new, well-equipped houses, schools, theaters, clubs, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, etc., have been built at an amazing speed. The total housing area in Stalingrad now exceeds that before the war. Many new streets have been built, including a wide, beautiful street in the city center, which the people of Stalingrad call "Peace Street." The construction of "Soviet Street" is also about to be completed. Many houses are being built on both sides of "Stalin Avenue." This street is a main thoroughfare running through the entire city, extending from the dam of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station to the Lenin Volga-Don Canal.
    The new houses in Stalingrad have all modern urban facilities. The architects took into account the climatic conditions and designed many balconies and open corridors to provide Stalingrad residents with rest and coolness during the hot summer days. In the courtyards of these newly built houses, there are fountains, flower beds, and lush trees everywhere.
    The City Soviet Executive Committee pays special attention to the education and health care of the people. About 60% of the municipal budget is used for education and health care. At present, 94 schools have been established. In five institutions of higher learning and many specialized secondary schools, young future experts—engineers, technicians, agronomists, doctors, and teachers—are studying hard. Many medical institutions, kindergartens, and nurseries have also been opened in the city.
    Much work has also been done in restoring and developing the municipal economy. For example, the amount of tap water consumed by Stalingrad residents is now much higher than before the war. The development of urban transportation—streetcars, buses, taxis, and water "streetcars" (i.e., public steamers)—has long exceeded the pre-war level. The streets and sidewalks are more clean and beautiful because they are paved with asphalt.
    Stalingrad residents are eager to turn their city into a garden, and they are building many boulevards, parks, and flowerbeds.
    The City Soviet consistently cares about how to better meet the needs of the working people's lives and has established many tailoring shops and shoe factories to serve the residents. To make it easier for residents to eat, more than 100 cafeterias and restaurants have been opened. In many stores in Stalingrad, all kinds of goods can be bought.
    During the period of the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan from 1951 to 1955, the work of building Stalingrad will be carried out on an even larger scale. At present, there are more than 400 large buildings under construction in the city. These are future apartments, primary and secondary schools, specialized universities, technical schools, and cinemas. The banks of the Volga River have also been built more beautifully.
    In mid-1952, granite steps were built on the riverbank. In the near future, many parks, flowerbeds, and boulevards will also be built.
    The future Stalingrad will be built even more grandly and magnificently. Today, our heroic city has become the central station for the great work of transforming nature. The Lenin Volga-Don Canal has been opened to navigation, and the originally remote five seas have been connected into a unified water transport system. The Stalingrad Hydropower Station, one of the world's largest hydropower stations, and the 600-kilometer-long Volga-Ural Canal are currently under construction. Large-scale irrigation systems are also being built in the Stalingrad steppes; to prevent the invasion of hot winds from the desert, huge windbreaks are also being planted.
    As in the past, Stalingrad still stands heroically at the forefront of the struggle for peace and a better future. (Attached picture)

    今日的斯大林格勒
    斯大林格勒市苏维埃执行委员会主席  塞尔盖·沙普罗夫
    编者按：今天是苏军在斯大林格勒围歼希特勒德国法西斯军队的伟大胜利的十周年。为了纪念这个伟大的日子，我们特发表这篇文章。
    十年以前，我们的城市曾被卷入了一次伟大战役的炮火中。英勇的斯大林格勒的保卫者不惜一切牺牲，在伏尔加河岸上对进犯的法西斯德寇进行了无情的抗击。在敌人炮火的轰击下，许多高楼大厦毁灭了，石块炸成粉末，钢骨水泥的建筑也打成碎片，但是斯大林格勒的英雄们却没有从战线上后退一步。他们为人民的和平与幸福的生活进行了斗争。在那里，他们不但阻止了敌人的进攻，而且围歼了敌人。
    一九四三年二月，当战火刚刚在斯大林格勒熄灭的时候，战前原是工厂林立、住房栉比的地区只剩下一片废墟和瓦砾。一切公用事业，如自来水、排水设备、市内交通等都遭到了彻底的破坏，那些以前曾经是公园、林荫道的地方也变成了一片被炸弹和炮弹炸得稀烂的焦土。
    还记得，在一座被毁坏了的楼房的墙上，斯大林格勒的捍卫者留有这样一句话：“斯大林格勒，我们一定要把你保卫住（Отстоим）。”后来有一个斯大林格勒的居民又在这句话的一个字中添上了一个字母，于是这句话就成为一个强有力的新的口号了：“斯大林格勒，我们一定要把你重建起来（Отстроим）。”
    就在那时，一个美国代表团来访问了斯大林格勒。在对这个被毁坏了的城市进行了一番视察之后，来自海外的新闻记者们就得出了这样的一个结论：要重建斯大林格勒是不可能的。他们以为如果在其他空地上建立一个新的城市那倒反而容易些。这些人没有了解我们对曾经用英雄们的鲜血所灌溉过的斯大林格勒的土地有着如何强烈的忠诚和热爱。他们也不懂得一个人民自己掌握了政权的国家又有着如何庞大的创造力和潜在力。
    在战争的年代里，整个苏维埃国家保卫了斯大林格勒，而在重建这个英雄城市的艰苦的日子里，整个国家又来帮助斯大林格勒人了。为了要使这个光荣的城市从瓦砾和废墟中重建起来，成千的建设者从苏联各地赶到伏尔加河畔来了。保卫斯大林格勒的英雄史诗刚刚结束，重建这座城市的英雄史诗就开始了。
    重建斯大林格勒的人们以对和平劳动所作的惊人贡献，来迎接这座英雄城市的胜利十周年纪念。英雄城市今天正生气勃勃地、精力充沛地生活着。斯大林格勒又重新成为苏联东南部的一个工业和文化的中心了，目前它正为国家生产着优良的拖拉机、掘土机，强大的挖泥装置、船只、医疗设备、鞋、服装及许多其他生产品。斯大林格勒生产的钢在伟大的共产主义建设工程中起着极大的作用。重新恢复起来的工业生产量已大大地超过战前的水平了。
    在与复兴工业的同时，城市中也进行了大规模的住房和文化机构的建设，公用事业飞快地发展了。过去这几年里，在展延于伏尔加河沿岸长达六十多公里的区域中，新的设备完美的住房、学校、戏院、俱乐部，医院、托儿所、幼儿园等，正以惊人的速度建设起来。目前斯大林格勒的住房总面积已经超过了战前。许多新的街道建设起来了，其中一条宽阔的、美丽的、位于市中心的街道，斯大林格勒人就称它为“和平街”。“苏维埃街”的建设也就要完工了。在“斯大林大街”的两边正在建造着许多房屋。这条街是横贯整个城市的一条主要干线，从斯大林格勒水力发电站的堤坝一直伸展到列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河。
    斯大林格勒的新房子都有一切现代的城市设备。建筑师们预先估计到气候的条件，就设计了许多阳台及露天走廊，以便在炎夏的日子里给斯大林格勒居民休息和纳凉。在这些新建的房子的庭院里，到处都是喷泉、花坛和葱郁的树木。
    市苏维埃执行委员会更特别重视人民的教育工作和保健工作。百分之六十左右的市政预算就是用于教育和保健两方面的。目前，已经建立九十四座学校。在五所高等学校和许多专科中学里，年轻的未来的专家们——工程师、技师、农学家、医生、教师们——都在紧张地学习着。城市里也开办了许多医疗机构、幼儿园和托儿所。
    在恢复和发展市政经济方面，也做了许多工作。例如目前斯大林格勒居民所消耗的自来水量，就比战前多了许多。市内交通——电车、公共汽车、出租汽车、水上“电车”（即公共汽船）——的发展程度早已超过了战前的水平。街道和人行道由于铺上了柏油更显得光洁美观。
    斯大林格勒居民渴望把他们的城市变成一座花园，他们建设着许多林荫道、公园和花圃。
    市苏维埃一贯地关怀着如何更好地来满足劳动人民生活上的需要，建立了许多缝衣店和制鞋工厂为居民们服务。为了居民们的饮食方便起见，一百多所食堂和饭馆开设起来了。在斯大林格勒的许多商店里，各色各样的商品都可以买到。
    在一九五一年到一九五五年的第五个斯大林五年计划的时期，建设斯大林格勒的工作将以更大的规模来进行。目前，市内就有四百多所大厦在建造着。这就是未来的公寓、中小学校、专科大学、技术学校和电影院等。伏尔加河岸也建筑得更加美丽了，
    一九五二年中，用花岗石建造起了河岸的阶梯。在不久的将来，还要建造起许多公园、花圃和林荫道。
    未来的斯大林格勒将建筑得更加庄严瑰丽。今天，我们的英雄城已成了改造大自然的伟大工作的中心站。列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河已经通航了，原来辽远隔绝的五个大海已被连成了一个统一的水路运输系统。目前正在建造着一座世界上最大水力发电站之一的斯大林格勒水电站和长达六百公里的伏尔加河—乌拉尔河大运河。在斯大林格勒草原上大规模的灌溉系统也正在兴修着；为了防止从沙漠吹来的热风的侵袭，巨大的防风林带也正在种植起来。
    和过去一样，斯大林格勒仍然英勇地站在为和平和更美好的将来而进行斗争的最前线。（附图片）
