We are Determined to Take Up the Weapon of Criticism in Newspapers
    Hebei Daily Editorial Department

    After seeing the "Newspaper Work Review on Newspapers in Various Regions Launching the Struggle Against Bureaucratism" published in the People's Daily on February 1st, which criticized us, we have a clear understanding of the shortcomings in carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. We have also gained great insight into how newspapers should currently shoulder the task of fighting against bureaucratism, commandism, violations of law and discipline, and the suppression of critics.

    In the past, Hebei Daily did not do well enough in carrying out the work of criticism and self-criticism. This is reflected in the fact that many critical reports were indeed published as cases after they had been resolved, and no efforts were made to continue mobilizing the masses to launch ideological struggles after publication. Or, although some shortcomings in the work were exposed in a timely manner, it was only a "dummy shot," and there was no follow-up. Or, when a movement came, it was grasped relatively tightly, but it relaxed after the movement passed. All this shows that Hebei Daily does show weakness in the struggle to carry out criticism and self-criticism. The report on the illegal and undisciplined acts of Wang Zhenhai, secretary of the Dingxian County Party Committee in Hebei, is a vivid example. When we saw the People's Daily announce the Wang Zhenhai incident on January 19th at 11 p.m., we telephoned Comrade Ma Guorui, the second secretary of the provincial party committee, to ask for his opinion on publishing the incident in Hebei Daily. Comrade Ma Guorui said that there were still some discrepancies in the situation mentioned in the People's Daily's brief commentary, and told us to publish it a few days later. At 11 p.m. on January 21st, we saw the People's Daily publish a draft of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously dealing with Wang Zhenhai's illegal and undisciplined behavior, and asked Comrade Ma Guorui whether to reprint it. At that time, Comrade Lin Tie, secretary of the provincial party committee, had returned from Beijing and said that some important details of the incident had not been clarified, and that it would be published together with the provincial party committee's review after a conclusion had been made. We also thought it would be better to handle it this way. Therefore, we did not urge the provincial party committee again later. It was not until January 31st, when the local newspaper group of the People's Daily asked us on the phone why we had not reprinted it, that we asked Comrade Lin Tie again. After seeing the criticism of us in the People's Daily's "Newspaper Work Review" on February 1st, we raised our opinions to Comrades Lin Tie and Ma Guorui. After discussion by the provincial party committee on February 3rd, we published it in the newspaper on February 4th. In short, we did not insist on our opinions on the Wang Zhenhai incident. Now we realize that although there are still some discrepancies in some details of the Wang Zhenhai incident, it is a major event related to the Hebei province, and it has been published in the central party newspaper, but it is wrong for our local newspaper not to reprint it or express its attitude. After the announcement of this incident, we also did very little in collecting readers' reflections to provide the provincial party committee and the People's Daily with information on public opinion and ideological conditions.

    Why did we show such weakness in newspaper criticism? The main reason is that we do not have a deep understanding of the role and responsibility of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, especially bottom-up criticism. Now, we have decided to conduct a study and discussion in the entire editorial department on how to correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. In the current internal inspection against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, we will focus on how well the work of carrying out criticism in newspapers has been done, conduct in-depth inspections, and are determined to take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, give play to the combat effectiveness of the party newspaper, and resolutely fight against all acts of bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

    The People's Daily's "Newspaper Work Review" on February 1st has given us a great education. It will enable us to better grasp the powerful weapon of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, and conscientiously overcome the weakness of carrying out criticism in newspapers in the future. At the same time, it has also educated us to strengthen contact with the central party newspaper in the future, so as to obtain guidance in our work on a regular basis.

    我们决心举起在报纸上进行批评的武器
    河北日报编辑部
    我们看到二月一日人民日报发表的“各地报纸展开反对官僚主义的斗争”的报纸工作述评对我们的批评后，使我们对于在报纸上展开批评与自我批评中存在的缺点，有了明确的认识；对目前报纸应怎样担负起向官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪以及压制批评者进行斗争的任务，给了很大的启示。
    河北日报在开展批评与自我批评这一工作上，过去是做得不够好的，这表现在有许多批评报道确实是在处理有了结果后，当作案件来发表的，发表后也没有继续发动群众展开思想斗争；或者虽及时揭发了工作中一些缺点，但仅是“虚幌一枪”，就没有下文了；或者当一个运动到来时抓得比较紧，运动过去也就松下来了。这都说明河北日报在开展批评与自我批评的斗争中，确实表现着软弱性。对河北定县地委书记王振海违法乱纪事件的报道，就是一个鲜明的例子。当我们在一月十九日夜十一时看到当天的人民日报公布王振海事件后，曾在电话上请示省委第二书记马国瑞同志，提出在河北日报上发表这一事件的意见。马国瑞同志说人民日报简评中所谈的情况有的还有出入，即告我们晚几天再登。到一月二十一日夜十一时，我们看见人民日报登出中共中央华北局正严肃处理王振海违法乱纪行为一稿，又请示马国瑞同志是否转登。当时省委书记林铁同志已从北京回来，说这事件有些重要情节还没有弄清楚，等作出结论后连同省委的检讨一块发表。我们在思想上也认为这样处理也好。因此后来也就没有再催问省委。直到一月三十一日人民日报地方报纸组从电话上问我们没有转载的原因时，我们才又请示林铁同志。我们见到二月一日人民日报
    “报纸工作述评”中对我们的批评后，又向林铁和马国瑞二同志提出意见。二月三日经省委讨论后，我们才在二月四日的报上发表了。总之，我们在王振海事件这一问题上坚持意见是不够的。现在我们才认识：王振海事件尽管在一些情节上还有出入，但是关系河北省地区的这样重大的事件，已在中央党报上发表了，而我们当地的报纸不转登又不表示态度是不对的。这一事件公布后，在搜集读者反映以供给省委和人民日报了解群众舆论和思想情况上，我们也做得很不够。
    为什么我们在报纸批评上表现了这样的软弱呢？主要是因为我们对于在报纸上展开批评与自我批评、尤其是自下而上批评的作用和责任，理解得不深刻。现在，我们决定把怎样在报纸上正确地开展批评与自我批评的问题，在全编辑部进行一次学习和讨论，在当前内部开展的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的检查中，即以执行在报纸上开展批评的工作做得怎样为重点，深入进行检查，并决心拿起批评与自我批评这一武器，发挥党报的战斗性，向一切官僚主义、命令主义以及违法乱纪的行为进行坚决的斗争。
    人民日报二月一日的“报纸工作述评”给了我们很大教育。它将使我们更好地掌握起在报纸上开展批评和自我批评这一有力的武器，在今后认真克服在报纸上开展批评的软弱病，同时，它也教育了我们今后要加强与中央党报的联系，以经常取得工作上的指导。
