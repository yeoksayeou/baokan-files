    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 21st: Under the sabotage of the re-militarization policy, the threat of food panic is endangering the lives of the Japanese people every year.

    Since the war, Japan's dependence on foreign food has been growing day by day. According to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, pre-war (1935) Japan imported more than 600,000 tons of grains, which increased to more than 1.3 million tons in 1947, and then surged to more than 3.4 million tons in 1951. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plan, Japan is still preparing to import more than 3.3 million tons of foreign food in the 1953 fiscal year, including about 1 million tons of rice. The large-scale import of foreign food, especially surplus American food, not only deepens Japan's agricultural crisis, but also increases Japan's financial burden. Taking rice as an example, the price of foreign rice is twice the price of Japanese grain procurement. In order to adjust the difference between domestic and foreign grain prices, the Japanese government spends huge amounts of "subsidies" every year. In the 1953 fiscal year, this expenditure will reach 32 billion yen. Not only that, the United States even forces Japan to accept inedible, rotten food.

    The main reason for Japan's food panic is that, under the protection of the American occupiers, Japan's feudal forces still exist. Although the American occupiers carried out the so-called "land reform" in Japan, poor peasants, tenant farmers, and middle peasants did not receive any real benefits. Feudal landlords still retain their control over the land, especially large tracts of wasteland. Even the statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry admit that with the current Japanese agricultural technology, the land that can be converted into arable land in Honshu and Hokkaido alone is 5.5 million cho (1 cho is about 15 mu), exceeding the total area of ​​Japan's current arable land. If such a large amount of land can be distributed to farmers with no or little land to cultivate, it can produce at least 4 million tons of grain.

    The American and Japanese reactionaries' exorbitant taxes and levies on the countryside have also greatly devastated agricultural production. The tax burden on Japanese farmers is as high as one-third or more of their income. The compulsory grain procurement system is still in place. Although the grain procurement price has recently been raised to 7,500 yen per koku, it is still less than three-quarters of the farmers' production cost. When farmers really cannot make a living, they can only leave their hometowns and seek other ways to survive. Therefore, there are tens of thousands of cases of abandonment of cultivated land every year.

    The emergence of a large number of American military bases is also an important reason for Japan's food shortage. According to the obviously reduced statistics of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the land exercise fields and airports occupied by the US military alone cover an area of ​​more than 36,000 cho, and the cultivated land occupied by the Japanese "Security Force" covers nearly 600 cho, which affects Japan's grain production by more than 27,000 koku. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry admits that this statistic does not include the impact on agricultural production of the additional approximately 100,000 cho of cultivated land occupied by the US military and the additional 8,800 cho of cultivated land occupied by the "Security Force." In addition, the United States also forces Japan to transport a large amount of grain to South Korea.

    The Yoshida government has formulated a so-called "five-year grain production increase plan," which is said to aim to achieve Japan's "self-sufficiency" in food in the ten years starting from 1953. Japanese progressive public opinion pointed out that this plan is not to relieve the people's food panic, but a re-edition of the "Patriotic Production Increase Plan" during the Tojo era, which attempted to store food for combat, and will further exploit the laboring farmers.

### 在美日反动派重新军国主义化政策的破坏下日本人民遭受日益严重的粮食恐慌威胁

    在美日反动派重新军国主义化政策的破坏下日本人民遭受日益严重的粮食恐慌威胁
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：在重新军国主义化政策的破坏之下，粮食恐慌每年都在威胁着日本人民的生活。
    战后以来，日本对国外粮食的依赖性一天天在增长。据大藏省的调查，战前（一九三五年）日本输入谷类六十多万吨，到一九四七年增加到一百三十多万吨，到一九五一年又激增到三百四十多万吨。根据农林省的计划，日本在一九五三会计年度还准备输入外国粮食三百三十多万吨，其中大米约一百万吨。外国粮食，特别是美国剩余粮食的大量进口，不但加深了日本的农业危机，并且加重了日本的财政负担。以大米来说，外国大米的价格是日本征粮价格的两倍。日本政府为了调整国内外粮价的差额，每年支出巨额的“补助费”，在一九五三会计年度这项费用将达三百二十亿日元。不仅如此，美国甚至强迫日本接受不堪食用的腐朽的粮食。
    造成日本粮食恐慌的主要原因是：在美国占领者的包庇之下，日本的封建势力仍然存在。虽然美国占领者曾在日本实行所谓“土地改革”，但是，贫农、雇农和中农都没有得到任何真正的利益。封建地主依然保留着他们对土地的统治，特别是大片的荒地。甚至农林省的统计都承认，用目前日本农业技术能改为耕地的土地，仅本州和北海道两地就有五百五十万町步（一町步约合十五市亩），超过日本目前耕地的总面积。这样大量的土地如果能够分给无地和少地的农民耕种，最低限度能够增产粮食四百万吨以上。
    美、日反动派对农村的苛征暴敛也大大摧残了农业生产。日本农民的赋税负担重达他们收入的三分之一以上。强制征粮制度到现在还在实行，虽然征粮价格最近提高到一日石七千五百日元，但是还不到农民生产成本的四分之三。当农民实在无法为生的时候，他们只能离乡背井，另谋生路。因此每年都有成万起的放弃耕地事件。
    大量美国军事基地的出现，更是造成日本粮荒的一个重要原因。根据日本农林省显然缩小了的统计，仅仅美军占用的面积达三万六千多町步的陆上演习场和飞机场以及日本“保安队”所占用的将近六百町步耕地，就影响日本粮食减产二万七千多日石。农林省承认，这个统计并没有包括美军所占用的另外约十万町步耕地和“保安队”所占用的另外八千八百多町步耕地对农业生产的影响。除此以外，美国还强制日本将大量的粮食运往南朝鲜。
    吉田政府已经制订了一个所谓“粮食增产五年计划”，据说要在从一九五三年起的十年中，达到日本粮食“自给自足”的目的。日本的进步舆论指出，这个计划并不是为了解除人民的粮食恐慌，而是东条时代企图存储作战粮食的“报国增产计划”的再版，并将进一步压榨劳动农民。
