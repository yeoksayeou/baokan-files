The Architectural Planning Committee for the Adjustment of Tsinghua, Peking, and Yanjing Universities (hereinafter referred to as the Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee) did not emphasize architectural engineering design work, and the 90,000 square meters of housing built last year are largely unsuitable.

After accepting the construction task, the Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee only paid attention to requesting materials and construction, neglecting the most important design issues. Before the design, there was no thorough survey, and when designing the overall layout, the development of the school and the connections between departments were not considered, nor were the road systems or landscaping plans. For example, the design of the residential area in the second construction zone, which was 30 meters wide and 2 kilometers long, was completed by a fourth-year student from the engineering college in two days. The terrain there was rugged and uneven, and the designer did not conduct detailed investigations and research, but simply pushed around with triangles and T-squares on the drawing board, arranging blocks. It was only during construction that many errors were discovered. The indoor ground level of some houses was lower than the outdoor level, posing a risk of flooding during rain. Because there were no landscaping plans, sand and gravel flew around in the wind. In architectural design, only economy was considered, without also considering suitability and aesthetics. For example, student dormitories were of a barrack-like style, with eight people in a room, three rooms connected, no doors, no formal corridors, and partitions only half the height of the room. As a result, if one room reads the newspaper, all three rooms have to listen; if one room holds a meeting, all three rooms have to listen; students' sleep and study are affected. When designing faculty and staff housing, only the usable area was calculated, without considering whether it was suitable. The houses are connected, with no corridors, and the toilets are placed right in the middle of the living room, which is very inconvenient for families with elderly and young people. One professor said: "Such a house is not as good as giving us a large room and letting us partition it ourselves." The apartment design did not consider the residents' situation. Residents have many boxes and trunks, but there is no place to put them, nor is there a place to boil water and cook.

The above-mentioned shortcomings occurred and were not corrected in time mainly because the Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee had a one-sided view of the task and an economic viewpoint. At the time, they only considered that school would start on October 1st last year, the task was urgent, and they hoped to quickly produce an overall layout so that they could immediately apply to the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Commission to buy land, do architectural design and outdoor water and electricity design, and transport materials to the construction site. Even in order to rush the task, the architectural design was completed before the overall layout was designed, the construction zone had already set the chalk lines, and the materials department had already transported the materials to the construction site. When the overall layout design was completed, it was found that the construction zone chalk lines were not properly placed, and the materials were not properly arranged. When the designer requested to move the chalk lines or materials, the construction zone refused. Because the leaders of the Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee had a serious sense of impatience, they did not take decisive measures to correct this error.

Despite their many design errors, there are still many units, under the guidance of the adventurous thought of not valuing design, that want to continue down their erroneous path. The Central Ministry of Light Industry, the Fourth Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Central Public Security Cadre School, and the Northwest Institute of Technology have recently, through the introduction of the Central Higher Education Department, gone to the Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee to request a full set of design drawings (including structural design drawings and engineering cost analysis), preparing to rigidly apply them to their own units. The cadres from the Fourth Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry who went to get the drawings said: "Our leadership wants us to take the drawings back within an hour so that we can immediately make various plans. This can save a lot of energy." The cadres from the Central Public Security Cadre School said: "We plan to build an auditorium and use your dining hall drawings, just without building the kitchen." The Three Universities Adjustment Architectural Planning Committee explained that their dining hall design may not be suitable for building an auditorium, and it itself has shortcomings, such as unclear speech, etc., but the cadres from the Central Public Security Cadre School said: "We really don't have time!" These units, treating construction projects with an irresponsible attitude, indiscriminately copying the designs of other units, are wrong. The Central Ministry of Light Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Higher Education Department should immediately check and correct this situation to avoid causing waste.

    清华北京大学新建房屋设计草率缺点很多
    许多单位急于求成仍想搬用这些设计
    清华、北京、燕京大学三校（即现在的清华、北京两大学）调整建筑计划委员会（下称三校调整建筑计划委员会），没有重视建筑工程设计工作，去年建筑的九万平方公尺房屋都不大适用。
    三校调整建筑计划委员会接受建设任务后，只注意了要材料和施工，忽略了最重要的设计问题。设计前没有周密勘测，设计总布置图时没有考虑学校的发展和各部门间的联系，没有考虑道路系统，没有绿化计划。如二工区三十公尺宽、二公里长的住宅区的设计，由工学院一个四年级的学生在两天时间就做完了。那里的地势崎岖不平，设计人也不详细调查研究，只是拿着三角板、丁字尺在画图棹上推来推去，排方块块。到施工时才发现很多错误。有的房子室内地平比室外的还低，一下雨就有被灌水的危险。因为没有绿化计划，大风一吹，沙石横飞。在建筑设计中，只考虑经济，而没有同时考虑是否适用和美观。如学生宿舍是统舱式的，八人一间，三间相连，没有门，没有正式走廊，隔断只有房间的一半高。结果一屋读报，三屋都得听；一屋开会，三屋都得听；学生睡觉、学习都受影响。设计教员及职工住宅时，只计算使用面积，没有考虑是否合用。房子相连，没有过道，把厕所摆在堂屋正中间，家中有老有少的人住着极不习惯。有一位教授说：“像这样的房子，还不如给我们一大间，自己去隔开好。”公寓设计没有考虑住户情况。住户的箱笼很多，没有地方放，烧水做饭的地方也没有。
    上述缺点所以发生和没有及时纠正，主要是因为三校调整建筑计划委员会有片面的任务观点和经济观点。当时，他们只考虑去年十月一日就要开学，任务紧急，希望赶快做出总布置图来，以便马上报请北京市都市计划委员会买地，做建筑设计和室外水电设计，把材料运到工地。甚至为了赶任务，总布置图没设计好，建筑设计就已经做完，工区已放好灰线，材料科也已经把材料运到工地。等做好总布置设计，发现工区灰线放得不合适，材料摆得不妥当，设计人要求移动一下灰线或材料时，工区都不答应。因为三校调整建筑计划委员会的领导人有严重的急躁情绪，也就没有采取坚决的措施纠正这种错误。
    他们的设计错误这样多，但还有不少单位在不重视设计的冒进思想的指导下，还要继续走他们的错误道路。中央轻工业部、第二机械工业部第四局、中央公安干部学校、西北工学院等单位，最近都通过中央高级教育部介绍，到三校调整建筑计划委员会要全套设计图样（包括设计结构图和工料分析），准备把它们硬搬到自己的单位来应用。中央第二机械工业部第四局去取图样的干部说：“我们领导方面要我们在一点钟内就拿图回去，以便立刻做各种计划。这样可以省很多精力。”中央公安干部学校的干部说：“我们准备盖一座礼堂，就用你们的饭厅图样，不盖厨房就行了。”三校调整建筑计划委员会说明，他们的饭厅设计不一定适合盖礼堂，并且它本身有缺点。如讲话听不清等，但中央公安干部学校的干部却说：“我们实在来不及了！”这些单位，以不负责的态度对待建筑工程，不加批判地搬用别的单位的设计，是不对的。中央轻工业部、第二机械工业部、公安部、高等教育部应即检查纠正，以免造成浪费。
