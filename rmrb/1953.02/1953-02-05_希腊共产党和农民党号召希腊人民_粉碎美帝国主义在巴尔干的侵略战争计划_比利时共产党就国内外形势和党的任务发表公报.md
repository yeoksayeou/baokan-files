Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 2nd: The Free Greece Radio broadcast the Greek Communist Party and Farmers' Party's appeal to the Greek people.

    The appeal said: War deployments in the Balkans are constantly intensifying. Following Turkish Foreign Minister Fuat Köprülü, Greek Foreign Minister Stephanopoulos also went to Belgrade to formally sign the Athens-Belgrade-Ankara military aggression alliance. Today, the Balkan Peninsula has become one of the centers of the US military aggression plan against the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union. The Greek people must be vigilant in order to crush the bloody plans of US imperialism and its Greek pawns. The Greeks will never fight against the people's democratic countries, never fight against free Bulgaria and free Albania, and never fight against their motherly protector, the Soviet Union. ... The Greek Communist Party and the Farmers' Party will continue to work tirelessly to unite patriots from the Liberal Party, the Bebergas Party, and other parties and groups into a democratic patriotic front. The highest interests of our people and our nation require us to do so.

    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, February 2nd: The Belgian Communist Party issued a communiqué on the domestic and international situation and the Communist Party's tasks in the struggle against war preparations and defending peace, democracy, and independence.

    After analyzing the current international situation, the communiqué said: The consequences of war preparations are particularly evident in the socio-economic sphere. The living conditions of the working people are deteriorating day by day. The social insurance system is widely under attack. Violations of the eight-hour working day are increasing. Labor safety conditions are worsening, and the accident rate in the steel industry and mines has increased significantly. Unemployment is also increasing, now reaching approximately 380,000 people.

    The communiqué continued: Every deterioration in living conditions provokes various actions in factories. In these actions, workers link various issues together and often raise the fundamental issue of social oppression.

    The communiqué emphasized: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party reminds all party members that they should always be at the forefront of the struggle and, whenever possible, take the initiative, clearly point out the goals of the struggle, constantly expose the methods used by the bourgeoisie's lackeys in the working class, and strive to bring the working people, especially the working masses of the Labor Party, into the struggle.

    The communiqué concluded by calling for a struggle to dissolve the current parliament and hold general elections, shorten the term of military service, and defend the social insurance system.

    比利时共产党就国内外形势和党的任务发表公报
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社索非亚二日讯：自由希腊电台广播了希腊共产党和农民党的告希腊人民书。
    告人民书说：在巴尔干的战争部署正在不断加紧。随着土耳其外交部长法特·柯普路鲁之后，希腊外交大臣斯捷方诺波洛斯也到贝尔格莱德去，准备正式签订雅典—贝尔格莱德—安卡拉军事侵略同盟。今天巴尔干半岛已成为美国针对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和苏联的军事侵略计划的中心之一。希腊人民必须警惕，以便粉碎美帝国主义及其希腊爪牙的血腥计划。希腊人绝不对人民民主国家作战，绝不对自由保加利亚和自由阿尔巴尼亚作战，希腊人绝不对他们慈母般的保卫者苏联作战。……希腊共产党和农民党要继续不断努力，把自由党、贝贝格斯党及其他各党派与团体的爱国志士团结到一个民主爱国阵线里来，我国人民和我们民族的最高利益要求我们这样做。
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔二日讯：比利时共产党就国内外形势以及共产党在反对战争准备、保卫和平民主和独立的斗争中的任务，发表公报。
    公报在分析了目前国际形势后说：备战的后果在社会经济方面特别明显。劳动人民的生活条件日趋恶化。社会保险制度广泛受到进攻。破坏八小时工作制的情况有增无已。劳动安全条件越来越恶化，在钢铁工业中和矿井中，出事比例大大增加。失业也不断增加，现在已约有三十八万人失业。
    公报继续说：每一次生活条件恶化，都在工厂激起各种行动。劳动者在行动中把各种问题联系起来，并且常常提出社会压迫的根源问题。
    公报着重说：比利时共产党中央委员会政治局提醒全体党员，他们应当处处站在斗争的最前列，而且只要有可能，就应采取主动，明确指出斗争的目标，经常揭穿资产阶级的走狗在工人阶级中使用的手段，而尽力把劳动人民，特别是工党的工人群众，吸收到斗争中来。
    公报最后号召为解散现在的议会并且举行大选、缩短服役期限和保卫社会保险制度而斗争。
