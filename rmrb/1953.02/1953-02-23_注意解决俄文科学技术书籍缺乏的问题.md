    Pay Attention to Solving the Problem of the Lack of Russian Scientific and Technical Books
    Editor's Note: Recently, many readers have written letters requesting a solution to the shortage of Russian books, especially Russian scientific and technical books, and have proposed some solutions. From the letters, it can be seen that the broad masses of people have a very high demand for learning from the Soviet Union. However, the serious shortage of Russian books has made it impossible for many people who understand Russian to directly learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and has caused difficulties for many people who have undergone intensive Russian learning in consolidating their learning results. It is hoped that the General Administration of Publications and the education departments, scientific research departments, and industrial departments will quickly find ways to solve this problem.
    The following is an excerpt of some of the readers' letters on this topic. Some positive suggestions have been put forward, and it is hoped that the General Administration of Publications, the Ministry of Higher Education and other relevant departments will study them. We also hope that the majority of readers will continue to provide solutions to this problem.
    Suggestion to Massively Photo-Copy Russian Professional Books
    (I)
    Liu Dehuan writes: In our Northeast Institute of Technology, a high tide of learning advanced Soviet science and technology is being set off, but there is a lack of Russian books. The library buys Russian books through the International Bookstore, and nine out of ten times it cannot buy them. The existing Russian books in the school are far from meeting the needs of teaching. For example, there are only a few copies of "Material Mechanics" and "Mechanical Components" in the library. Teachers hope to borrow them to translate teaching materials, teaching assistants hope to borrow them as continuing education reading materials, and one or two thousand students hope to have them openly available in the library.
    In order to better learn advanced Soviet science and technology, it is suggested that the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications attach importance to this issue, conduct in-depth investigations into the types and quantities of Russian books needed by universities and colleges across the country, and after consulting with the Soviet publishing agencies, organize domestic publishing institutions to photo-copy Russian books in a planned manner.
    (II)
    Pei Qing writes: Since April of last year, I have been purchasing Russian middle school chemistry textbooks from the International Bookstore for teaching reference, but I have not been able to buy them yet. It is suggested that the General Administration of Publications uniformly purchase new books from the Soviet Union according to domestic needs, and select books previously sent by the Soviet Union to our country, and after soliciting the consent of the Soviet authors and publishing agencies, photo-copy them domestically. This will not affect the Soviet publishing plan and can solve the needs of the vast majority of people in the country for Russian books. In addition, the International Bookstore should improve its work in handling purchases of books from abroad on behalf of readers.
    Cannot Buy Books to Read After Intensive Russian Learning
    It is Difficult to Consolidate Learning Results
    (I)
    Zheng Mingqi, Zhang Caili, Wang Zhengang and other fourteen people write: After eighteen days of intensive Russian learning, the students in our Pharmacological Department Teacher Training Class of Peking Union Medical College have initially been able to read Russian medical books. We are eager to learn advanced Soviet medical experience, but the lack of Russian books is hindering our learning. There is only one Russian pharmacology textbook in our school, and we cannot buy it at the International Bookstore. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Health and the General Administration of Publications will find ways to supply us with Russian medical books.
    (II)
    Zhong Min writes: Since July of last year, I have been purchasing Russian books on chemical engineering from the International Bookstores in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin and other places, but I have not been able to buy them. In October last year, our agency conducted intensive Russian learning, and now many people can read Russian books. However, there are very few Russian professional books on chemical engineering in the agency, and everyone has no books to read after learning Russian. Not only can they not directly learn advanced Soviet science and technology, but they cannot consolidate the results of intensive learning. The International Bookstore should find ways to supply a large number of various Russian professional books, and improve its work in accepting readers' entrusted purchases of Russian books.

### 注意解决俄文科学技术书籍缺乏的问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    注意解决俄文科学技术书籍缺乏的问题
    编者按：最近很多读者来信，要求解决俄文书籍特别是俄文科学技术书籍缺乏的问题，并提出了一些解决办法。从来信中可以看出：目前广大人民学习苏联的要求是很高的，但是缺乏俄文书籍的严重情况，已经使很多懂得俄文的人无法直接学习苏联先进的科学技术，使很多经过俄文速成学习的人在巩固学习成果时发生了困难。希望出版总署和教育部门、科学研究部门、工业部门迅速设法解决这个问题。
    下面摘要发表的，是有关这方面的读者来信中的一部分。其中提出了一些积极的建议，希望出版总署、高等教育部等有关部门加以研究。我们还希望广大读者继续提供解决这个问题的办法。建议大量影印俄文专业
    书籍（一）
    刘德桓来信：我们东北工学院正掀起学习苏联先进科学技术的高潮，但缺乏俄文书籍。图书馆通过国际书店购买俄文书籍十次有九次买不到，而校内现有的俄文书籍远不能满足教学需要。如“材料力学”、“机械原件”两书，图书馆只有几本。教师们希望借去翻译教材，助教们希望借去作进修研读材料，而一两千名同学希望放在图书馆公开阅览。
    为了更好学习苏联先进科学技术，建议中央人民政府高等教育部和出版总署重视这个问题，深入调查全国各院校需要俄文书籍的种类和数量，商得苏联出版机关的同意后，组织国内出版机构有计划地影印俄文书籍。（二）
    培青来信：我从去年四月起就向国际书店购买俄文的中学化学课本作教学参考，但至今还没买到。建议出版总署根据国内需要，统一向苏联选购新书，并把过去苏联送给我国的书籍加以选择，征求苏联的作者和出版机关的同意后在国内影印。这样既不影响苏联的出版计划，又能解决国内广大人民对俄文书籍的需要。此外，国际书店应该改进办理代读者向国外购买书籍的工作。
    速成学习俄文后买不到书读
    要巩固学习成果就有了困难
   （一）
    郑明祺、张才丽、王振纲等十四人来信：我们协和医学院药理学系师资训练班的学员经过十八天俄文速成学习后，已经初步能够阅读俄文医学书籍了。我们迫切希望学习苏联先进医学经验，但是俄文书籍缺乏却使我们的学习受到阻碍。我们学校里仅有一本俄文的药理学教科书，到国际书店也买不到。希望中央卫生部和出版总署设法供应我们俄文医学书籍。（二）
    钟敏来信：从去年七月开始，我就分别向北京、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨等地的国际书店购买有关化工的俄文书籍，但一直买不到。去年十月份，我们机关进行俄文速成学习，现在已有不少人能阅读俄文书了。但是机关里有关化工的俄文专业书籍很少，大家学了俄文没有书念，不但不能直接学到苏联先进科学技术，也不能巩固速成学习的成果。国际书店应该设法大量供应各种俄文专业书籍，并改进办理接受读者委托代购俄文书籍的工作。
