Reader Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    The Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party writes: The criticism made by reader Zhen Gu in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 8th regarding the failure of the Party committees of factories and other units in Hefei to adhere to meeting times is correct. After seeing this criticism, we immediately conducted an inspection, which proved that the situation reflected by the reader was factual. In addition, we also found that many meetings in other departments of our city also had the phenomenon of not adhering to the time, and many meetings were delayed by half an hour or even an hour. Adding up this frequently wasted time, the total is very alarming. This is a serious waste phenomenon that lacks a mass viewpoint and does not cherish the time of comrades. This is as intolerable as economic waste. Therefore, we fully accept Comrade Zhen Gu's criticism and decided to formulate a plan for future meetings and a system for adhering to time, and to educate all staff members.

    中共合肥市委员会决心纠正不准时开会的现象
    中共合肥市委员会来信：一月八日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表的读者震谷对合肥市工厂党委会等单位开会不遵守时间的批评是正确的。我们见到这个批评后当即进行检查，证明读者反映的情况都是事实。此外，我们并检查出我市其他部门的许多会议也有不遵守时间的现象，很多会议都迟开半点钟甚至一点钟。把这经常浪费的时间加起来，总数是很惊人的，这是一种缺乏群众观点、不珍惜同志们时间的严重浪费现象，这和经济上的浪费是同样不能容忍的。因此，我们完全接受震谷同志的批评，决定订出今后开会的计划及遵守时间的制度，并向全体工作人员进行教育。
