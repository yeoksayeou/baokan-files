Editor's note: Cadres of the East China Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Railway Administration continue to expose Huang Yifeng's anti-Party behavior. Among them, the most serious is his consistent resistance to the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, treating cadres as "private property," and regarding the units under his leadership as "independent kingdoms," seriously violating the Party's organizational principles and cadre policies. This is another principled issue that should attract our serious attention. We must wage an irreconcilable struggle against all erroneous behaviors that violate the Party's organizational principles and cadre policies and engage in divisive independence from the Party. We believe that, at present, all departments and regions across the country should draw more lessons from the Huang Yifeng incident, seriously examine their work, and resolutely prevent and correct all phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee made the correct decision to expel the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng from the Party, cadres of the East China Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Railway Administration continued to expose Huang Yifeng's serious anti-Party behavior, especially further revealing that Huang Yifeng treated the units under his leadership as "independent kingdoms," acting arbitrarily, abusing cadres at will, and resisting the leadership of the Party and the government.

For several years, Huang Yifeng seriously violated the Party's cadre policy, arbitrarily abused private individuals, and treated cadres as his private property. In addition to calling on机关 cadres to introduce private individuals to work at the East China Ministry of Transportation, the private individuals he personally introduced to work at the East China Ministry of Transportation were found in all units. Most of these people were his old friends, old subordinates, fellow villagers, students, etc. Huang Yifeng also favored, and even promoted out of turn, some people with complex histories, unclear political backgrounds, and poor qualities. Huang Yifeng believed that anyone who was obedient, compliant, or knew how to boast, flatter, and fawn was a good cadre; conversely, those who could adhere to principles were "bad" cadres. Huang Yifeng had three methods for dealing with cadres: "beat," "pull," and "drive." He would attack cadres who criticized him; he would use all means to win over cadres he thought he could use; and he would try to "drive" cadres who were not "honest" after being attacked out of the East China Ministry of Transportation. Huang Yifeng regarded cadres as his private property, believing that the more "private property" he had, the bigger his "official position" would be. He often cited the development of the East China Ministry of Transportation from dozens of people to one or two thousand as his personal glory, saying that this was his "major achievement." Therefore, he believed that no one could touch his cadres. For example, in August 1952, the East China Financial and Economic Committee wanted to transfer ten civil engineering personnel from the East China Ministry of Transportation to Anshan Iron and Steel Company to participate in basic construction work, but Huang Yifeng insisted on not transferring them. Also, in the autumn of the same year, the Government Administration Council drew thirty civil engineering personnel from the original East China Military and Political Committee to build highways in the Southwest. The East China Personnel Department wanted the Ministry of Transportation to consider transferring them. Huang Yifeng disagreed with the transfer and complained that Sun Liang, deputy director of the Personnel Department of the East China Ministry of Transportation, should not have reported the statistics of engineering personnel to the Personnel Department of the Central Ministry of Transportation. He flew into a rage at Sun Liang and said: "Sun Liang! Isn't having the East China Personnel Department as your father enough? Why are you looking for the Personnel Department of the Central Ministry of Transportation as your father!" In the end, knowing that he could not refuse the transfer, he instructed the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation to transfer personnel with lower technical skills to the Central Government. In order to conceal the number of technical personnel and avoid being drawn, Huang Yifeng included the engineering personnel of the East China Ministry of Transportation who were part-time teachers at schools in the statistics of school teachers.

Huang Yifeng has always been arrogant, self-important, credited himself, disregarded organization, and violated discipline, turning the units under his leadership into "independent kingdoms." In September 1952, Huang Yifeng came to Beijing to attend the National Highway Transportation Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Transportation. At the meeting, the leaders of the Central Ministry of Transportation gave new instructions on the work of intermodal transportation and automobile transportation, and the meeting also made new resolutions on highway transportation work. Those who went to the meeting together believed that these instructions and resolutions were very important and asked Huang Yifeng to seriously convey them after returning. However, Huang arrogantly believed: "The summary of the intermodal transportation work was all based on the report from East China, and there is nothing new in it; there is nothing new in the summary of automobile transportation either," and he decided on his own not to hold a meeting to convey it. In this way, the spirit of the National Highway Transportation Conference could not be well implemented in East China, and the transportation departments of various provinces and regions still carried out their work according to the old policies, violating the spirit of the Central Government. Huang Yifeng also openly violated the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities on many occasions. For example, in the second half of 1951, the Central Ministry of Transportation convened a statistical conference and decided that "all levels of transportation administrative organs and specialized enterprises that do not yet have dedicated transportation statistical organizations should immediately engage in establishing them." "Within the grassroots units, actively prepare to universally establish grassroots statistical units or statistical personnel." Huang Yifeng arbitrarily changed the principle of "universally establishing" in the resolution to "key establishment or improvement of institutions" and "priority should be given to enterprise departments." This completely did not conform to the requirements of the Central Government. Huang Yifeng even looked down on the responsible comrades of the Central Ministry of Transportation. For example, the Central Ministry of Transportation once sent a telegram to solicit his opinion on issues such as organizational structure and intermodal transportation policies. He was dissatisfied with the opinions put forward by the Central Ministry of Transportation and even slandered the responsible comrades of the Central Ministry of Transportation as "people without opinions." Huang Yifeng went to the Central Ministry of Transportation several times to discuss issues. If the Central Ministry of Transportation did not immediately agree, he would complain behind his back. For example, when Shanghai was just liberated, the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee made a decision to ensure the urgent needs of the people of Shanghai for coal and grain, requiring the Shanghai Railway Administration to guarantee the completion of the transportation tasks of grain and coal. However, Huang Yifeng, who was then the director of the Shanghai Railway Administration, openly opposed the correct decision of the East China Bureau at the railway party committee meeting, saying: To transport coal and grain, money must be provided. He even treated the superiors and some responsible comrades with a tone of abuse. He arrogantly refused criticism at the meeting, insisted on his mistakes, and used various excuses to obstruct the transportation of coal and grain urgently needed by the people of Shanghai. During the streamlining of institutions after the "Three-Anti" movement, the higher authorities stipulated that the establishment of the East China Ministry of Transportation was 300 people, but the actual number of people in the Ministry of Transportation greatly exceeded this number. Huang Yifeng adopted the method of combining the administrative units with the enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Transportation, requiring the enterprise units to bear part of the expenses of the administrative staff. This invisibly increased the burden on the enterprise units and reduced national income, completely violating the spirit of the central government's instructions on streamlining institutions. Even now, the salaries of more than 100 staff members of the administrative units of the East China Ministry of Transportation are still paid by the enterprise units.

Huang Yifeng often shamelessly boasted about himself. He often boasted:
"When I was in the Northeast, I ran a railway college, and most of the cadres of the Shanghai Railway Administration were trained by me, Huang Yifeng." Even at the meeting commemorating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Party, he basely promoted his so-called "glorious history." In fact, he left the revolution after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War and only rejoined the Party during the climax of the Anti-Japanese War. Another bad style of Huang Yifeng is to seek fame and reputation and swindle and deceive. For example, when Shanghai was just liberated, the East China Financial and Economic Committee notified that each employee of the Shanghai area of the Shanghai Railway Administration could borrow 2,000 yuan; however, Huang Yifeng crossed out words such as "According to the notice of the East China Financial and Economic Committee" in the notice issued by the bureau and published it in his personal name, expressing his personal care for the lives of the employees, in order to please the employees.

After Huang Yifeng's acts of suppressing criticism and violating Party discipline were exposed, he still did not repent, insisted on his mistakes, and insisted that "I have no mistakes." When the East China Bureau decided to publish his mistakes in suppressing criticism in the Party newspaper, he said angrily in his office: "They (referring to the East China Bureau) want to make me stink all over the country, making me unable to face people." It was not until January 29 this year, when the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a general party member meeting of the Ministry of Transportation to expose and criticize Huang Yifeng's anti-Party crimes, that he saw that his former "confidants" had also revealed his repeated disloyalty to the Party, and then he lowered his head with a red face and neck. The next day of the conference, the chairman of the conference accepted everyone's opinions and asked Huang Yifeng to express his attitude on the stage. Although Huang Yifeng expressed his willingness to accept the lessons, correct his mistakes, start anew, and follow the Communist Party forever under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and serve the people to the end; however, his understanding of his mistakes was still not profound enough, and his attitude was still not honest enough.

    黄逸峰一贯反党的严重行为继续被揭发
    编者按：华东交通部和上海铁路管理局的干部，继续揭发了黄逸峰的反党行为，其中，最严重的是他一贯抗拒党和人民政府的领导，把干部当作“私有财产”，把自己领导的单位当做“独立王国”，严重地违反了党的组织原则和干部政策。这是应该引起我们严重注意的又一个原则问题。我们必须和一切违反党的组织原则和干部政策，向党闹独立性的分散主义的错误行为，进行不调和的斗争。我们认为，目前在全国各部门、各地区都应该从黄逸峰事件中吸取更多的教训，严肃地检查工作，坚决防止与纠正一切无组织无纪律的现象。
    【本报讯】中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会作出开除反党分子黄逸峰党籍的正确决定以后，华东交通部和上海铁路管理局的干部继续揭发了黄逸峰反党的严重行为，特别是进一步揭露了黄逸峰把自己所领导的单位当作“独立王国”而为所欲为，任意滥用干部，反抗党和政府领导的行为。
    几年来，黄逸峰严重地违反了党的干部政策，任意滥用私人，把干部当作自己的私产。他除了号召机关干部介绍私人到华东交通部来工作外，自己介绍到华东交通部工作的私人遍于各单位。这些人大多是他的老朋友、老部下、乡亲、学生等。对其中一些历史复杂、政治面目不清、品质不良的人，黄逸峰也一概重用，甚至越级提拔。凡是唯命是从、百依百顺或会吹牛拍马、阿谀逢迎的人，黄逸峰都认为是好干部；反之，能坚持原则的则是“坏”干部。黄逸峰对干部有三种手段：“打”、“拉”、“赶”。对批评他的干部加以打击；对他认为可利用的干部则用一切办法拉拢；对受了打击后还不“老实”的干部则想法“赶”出华东交通部去。黄逸峰把干部当作自己的私产，认为自己的“私产”越多，自己“官”就越大。他常常把华东交通部从几十个人发展到一两千人的事情引为他个人的光荣，说这是他的“一大成绩”。因此，他认为谁也不能动他的干部。例如一九五二年八月，华东财政经济委员会要从华东交通部调十名土木工程人员到鞍山钢铁公司去参加基本建设工作，黄逸峰就坚持不调。又如同年秋天，政务院向原华东军政委员会抽调三十名土木工程人员去西南修建公路。华东人事部要交通部考虑抽调。黄逸峰不同意调，还埋怨华东交通部人事处副处长孙良不应该把工程人员统计数字报告中央交通部。他对孙良大发脾气，说：“孙良！你有华东人事部这个爸爸还不行吗？为什么又找中央交通部人事司这个爸爸！”最后，他知道不调不行，又指示山东省交通厅调技术水平较低的人员给中央。黄逸峰为了隐瞒技术人员的数目，免得被抽调，就把华东交通部到学校兼课的工程人员统计到学校教员中去。
    黄逸峰一贯狂妄自大、居功自傲、目无组织、不守纪律，把自己领导的单位变成了“独立王国”。一九五二年九月，黄逸峰曾来北京参加中央交通部召开的全国公路运输会议。会上，中央交通部首长对于联运工作和汽车运输工作作了新的指示，会议对于公路运输工作也作了新的决议，同去开会的人都认为这些指示和决议非常重要，回去后要求黄逸峰认真传达。但是黄竟狂妄地认为：“联运工作总结部分都是根据华东的报告作的，没有什么新的内容；关于汽车运输总结部分也没有什么新东西”，就擅自决定不开会传达。这样，全国公路运输会议的精神在华东就没有能很好地贯彻下去，各省、区交通部门仍然根据旧的方针进行工作，违背了中央的精神。黄逸峰还多次公开地违抗上级的指示和决定。例如一九五一年下半年，中央交通部召开统计会议，决定“凡各级交通行政机关及专业企业中尚无专责的交通统计机构者，应即从事建立。”“于各基层单位之内，积极准备普遍建立基层统计单位或统计人员。”黄逸峰竟擅自将决议中的“普遍建立”的原则，改为“重点的建立或健全机构”、“首先应以企业部门为主”。这就完全不符合于中央的要求。黄逸峰甚至连中央交通部的负责同志也看不起。如中央交通部曾为组织机构和联运方针等问题来电报征询他的意见。他对中央交通部提出来的意见不满，还污蔑中央交通部的负责同志为“没主见的人”。黄逸峰曾几次到中央交通部谈问题，如遇中央交通部没有立即同意时，他就背后发牢骚。又如上海刚解放时，中共中央华东局为了保证供应上海市人民对燃煤和粮食的迫切需要，曾作出决定，要求上海铁路管理局保证完成粮、煤的运输任务。但是，当时身为上海铁路管理局局长的黄逸峰却在铁路党委会上公开反对华东局的正确决定，并说：要运煤粮，必须拿钱来。他甚至还用谩骂的口吻对待上级和一些负责同志。他傲慢地在会上拒绝批评，坚持错误，用种种藉口阻碍上海人民迫切需要的煤和粮的运输。“三反”运动后精简机构时，上级规定华东交通部的编制是三百人，实际交通部的人数超过很多。黄逸峰就采取行政单位与交通部所属的企业单位合署办公的办法，要企业单位负担一部分行政工作人员的开支。这样就无形中加重了企业单位的负担，减少了国家收入，完全违背了中央指示的精简机构的精神。直到现在华东交通部行政单位的工作人员还有一百多人的薪金是在企业单位中开支的。
    黄逸峰经常恬不知耻地自吹自擂。他常吹嘘说：
    “我在东北时办了铁路学院，上海铁路局的干部大部是我黄逸峰培养出来的。”甚至就在纪念党成立的三十一周年的大会上，他也卑劣地宣扬自己的所谓“光荣历史”。实际上他在第一次国内革命战争失败以后就脱离了革命，到抗日战争高潮时才又重新混入党内的。黄逸峰的另一恶劣作风，是沽名钓誉，招摇撞骗。例如上海刚解放时，华东财政经济委员会通知：上海铁路管理局上海地区的员工每人可借支二千元；但黄逸峰却在局里发的通知中，勾掉“奉华东财委通知”等字，而以个人名义发表，表示他个人对职工生活的照顾，以此来讨好职工。
    黄逸峰压制批评、违反党纪的行为被揭发后，他仍毫不悔悟，坚持错误，硬说“我没有错误”。当华东局决定在党报上公布他压制批评的错误时，他在办公室里还生气地说：“他们（指华东局）想把我在全国搞臭，使我见不得人。”直到今年一月二十九日，中共中央华东局召开交通部总支党员大会揭发批判黄逸峰反党罪行时，他看到过去自己的“亲信”也揭穿了他一再对党不忠实的内幕后，才面红耳赤地缩下头去。大会第二天，大会主席接受大家的意见要黄逸峰到台上表示态度，黄逸峰虽然表示了愿在共产党和毛主席的领导下，接受教训，痛改前非，重新做人，永远跟着共产党走，为人民服务到底；但是，他对自己的错误的认识仍然很不深刻，态度仍然是不够老实的。
