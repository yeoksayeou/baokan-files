    In the Regiment Command Post
    Yang Qi
    At 2:00 PM on October 6, 1952, the sporadic trial firing ceased. A company of Rhee Syngman's puppet army entrenched on the "611" position on the Kim Sung front began to exhibit a pre-battle tranquility. The setting sun cast the shadow of the main peak of Mount Qiaoyan obliquely over this mountain, desolate and gloomy. The fate of death was about to befall this group of puppet soldiers.
    In a tunnel on another hill, however, a different scene emerged. There weren't many people here, but there were many telephones and radios. A bright gas lamp was lit in the tunnel, and the staff officers and radio operators of a volunteer army unit were constantly issuing commanders' orders to infantry, artillery, logistics, and other departments. As the orders went out through the telephone lines, a magnificent pre-battle scene unfolded on the volunteer army positions: countless cannons hidden in various locations were turning their huge firing ports towards the firing targets; seasoned infantry soldiers, after thorough pre-battle preparations, were gathering at the attack points; logistics units were crossing mountains and ridges, braving enemy fire, to transport ammunition to the front lines...

                            ×　×　×
    An hour before the battle began, Liu Fengyong, platoon leader of the 6th Company, 1st Platoon, and first-class meritorious hero, who was tasked with capturing the No. 5 hilltop on the main peak of the "611" position held by Rhee's puppet army, arrived at the regiment command post. He immediately walked up to the regiment leaders who were eating dinner:
    "Report!"
    Several regiment commanders stood up and made room for the hero to sit down.
    After a moment of silence, Regiment Commander Wang asked:
    "Well, are you ready?"
    "Ready!" Platoon Leader Liu replied calmly: "We are ready for everything! Regiment Commander, all we need is a combat order."
    Then Platoon Leader Liu reported the soldiers' determination to the regimental leaders. Their assault platoon was one of the vanguard units in the Fifth Campaign and later participated in a certain blocking action. They had experienced a path of victory, and their company had become a first-class meritorious company as a result. Platoon Leader Liu said that every soldier in their assault platoon cherished the honor of their company and guaranteed to complete this combat mission.
    Regiment Commander Wang listened quietly to Platoon Leader Liu's words, looked at his watch and said:
    "It's getting late!" He pushed away his bowl of rice and stood up, pressing his hand tightly on Platoon Leader Liu's shoulder. Platoon Leader Liu said excitedly:
    "Regiment Commander Wang, I understand everything you mean! Now that No. 5 hilltop has been handed over to us, it will no longer be the enemy's after a while."
                                ×　×　×
    Time was moving quietly forward. People were nervously awaiting that solemn moment...
    Finally, at exactly 5:00 PM, our army's artillery began firing according to the pre-arranged plan.
    A earth-shaking sound suddenly rang out, and countless cannons from the depths of the several-mile-deep positions fired tons upon tons of steel, slamming into the "611" position, which was only three to four hundred square meters across, at the same time, sending the fortifications built by the enemy over the past year and the enemy's corpses flying into the air. Forty minutes later, the enemy position, which had been filled with smoke and dust, had become a volcano with golden stars bursting forth. At this time, Regiment Commander Wang excitedly shouted to the infantry commanders on the phone:
    "Ask the soldiers if they saw our artillery fire? Is our artillery accurate?" Then he instructed the commanders: "You must fight well, fight hard!"
    At 5:54, precisely four minutes after our artillery began to extend its range and the infantry began to charge, intense gunfire rang out on the "611" position. At this time, the comrades in the regiment command post were nervously and quietly guarding the radio. However, the receiver remained silent. What was going on?... After another minute, a minute that felt longer than an hour, the radio operator's eyes suddenly lit up, and his voice was so loud that it almost changed its original tone:
    "It's me! Is this Platoon Leader Liu? How is it going?" He pressed his left ear tightly with one hand and shouted loudly: "Please say it again, louder... Ah! Ah!"
    The radio "bang"ed against the table made of ammunition boxes, and the candle fell over.
    "Report to the Regiment Commander, Platoon Leader Liu just reported to you that the 1st Platoon occupied No. 5 hilltop in four minutes and is now advancing towards No. 6 hilltop."
    Regiment Commander Wang took a deep breath and looked at the comrades around him and said: "Okay, this shot has been fired!" When Company Commander Li Yuangui reported the battle progress to him on the radio, he replied:
    "Order the comrades of the 3rd Platoon to attack No. 10 hilltop! Attack while the enemy is in chaos! Resolutely attack!"
                                ×　×　×
    However, at this moment, the enemy's artillery fire had engulfed this lost position. These shells, carrying those whistling fragments, formed a tight wall of fire on the road from No. 5 to No. 10 hilltop. This situation was very unfavorable for the soldiers of the 6th Company's 3rd Platoon who were attacking while exposed on this narrow mountain ridge. But no difficulties could stop our soldiers. They skillfully used the broken traffic trenches that had been covered with thick soil to avoid shells,
    while at the same time, they fearlessly stepped on the enemy's corpses to seize the No. 10 hilltop on the "611" position that was wedged into the enemy's depth. This was a head-on hard fight, because on this hundred-meter stretch of road, the remaining bunkers and enemies in the covered trenches were still resisting stubbornly; and the enemies entrenched on the No. 10 position were also launching counterattacks. But the enemy's struggles were useless; the enemy's bunkers were blown up one by one, and even the weapons of the enemies who were stubbornly resisting were blown away;
    A group of counterattacking enemies had just swarmed down No. 10 hilltop when they were hit by a barrage of dense grenades and explosive packs, and personnel and weapons were lost
    by more than half, and the remaining ones raised their hands to surrender.
    On the evening of the 6th, Squad Leader and machine gunner Lin Shun and eighteen-year-old ammunition handler Wu Wenzhong from the 6th Company, 7th Squad followed the demolition team to pull the machine gun to No. 10 hilltop, repelling more than a dozen enemy counterattacks in a row. But at dawn the next day, Wu Wenzhong was wounded in the enemy's last charge, and blood flowed straight down his chest. Squad Leader Lin knew that this little guy couldn't hold on, but because the enemy was charging, he didn't have time to bandage his comrade's wound, he could only free his left hand to support him and lean him on his shoulder. Little Wu knew that he was not going to make it, so he used his last bit of strength to finish loading the last magazine. On the morning of the 7th, I saw Comrade Lin Shun in the regiment command post, he was escorting prisoners here. He told me about the battle situation at that time:
    "At that time, I thought that Little Wu could hold on for a while, because from the time he was wounded to the time he died, he didn't utter a cry of pain. Until the very end, he still said: 'Squad Leader, don't worry about it, just fight! I'll load the bullets for you. We can't lose the position!' By the time I pushed the enemies back, I realized that he had already sacrificed on my shoulder. I cried, but my energy was even greater, I wanted to avenge Little Wu. So, I knocked down more than twenty enemies with one magazine...".
                            ×　×　×
    After the 7th, the battle on the "611" position entered the defensive stage. Although the enemy continued to launch continuous counterattacks with a company to a battalion of troops, our positions could not be shaken. On the 8th, in the regiment command post, the radio was constantly reporting the enemy's counterattacking forces and the charging points, while Regiment Commander Wang was issuing combat orders in an orderly manner, causing the number of enemy troops annihilated by our army on the "611" position to increase again and again. This was a pleasant battle of annihilation. Our army's artillery fire rolled like a whirlwind on the road where the enemy was charging towards us, knocking down those enemies who were charging or had just gathered in whole companies and platoons on the ground. At noon, just as the enemy was yelling "Enemy artillery fire is fierce" on the radio, our army's division commander was issuing combat orders to Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang, who was commanding the artillery, on the phone:
    "We've just allocated another batch of shells to you, and we're limiting you to firing all these shells in one go during the enemy's next charge. This is an order! Remember! Be sure to bomb the places where the enemy is densely populated; if you don't have enough shells, you can call me!"
    Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang put down the earphones and said: "Staff Officer Lu, notify the artillery group to fire five rapid shots 100 meters due south of No. 10! The harder you hit, the better! Fire! Fire!"

    在团指挥所里
    杨奇
    一九五二年十月六日下午二时，若断若续的试射炮火停止了。李承晚伪军一个连盘踞着的金城前线“六一一”阵地上，开始呈现出一种战斗前的寂静。夕阳把乔岩山主峰的阴影斜罩在这座山头上，凄凉而阴沉。死亡的命运就要降落到这批伪军的头上了。
    在另一个山头上的坑道里，却出现了另一种景象。这里人不多，电话机和报话机却很多。坑道里燃起一盏雪亮的煤气灯，志愿军某部的参谋们和报话机员们，正一刻不停地向着步兵、炮兵、后勤等部门下达着指挥员的命令。这命令通过电话线传出去，志愿军阵地上立刻展开了一幅战斗前的壮丽的图景：隐蔽在各处的无数门大炮，正在把巨大的射击口转向射击目标；久经战斗的步兵战士们，在经过充分的战前准备之后，正向攻击地点集结；后勤部队正翻山越岭，冒着敌人的炮火，把弹药运送到前沿阵地去……。
                            ×　×　×
    在战斗开始前的一个钟头，担任攻占李伪军“六一一”阵地主峰五号山头的六连一排排长、一等功臣刘凤勇来到了团指挥所。他立刻走到正在吃晚饭的团首长面前：
    “报告！”
    几位团指挥员都站了起来，腾出一个位子让这位英雄坐下。
    在片刻的沉默之后，王团长问道：
    “怎样，准备好了么？”
    “好了！”刘排长从容地回答：“我们什么都准备好了！团长，我们就缺少一个战斗命令了。”
    接着刘排长又向团首长报告了战士们的决心。他们突击排在第五次战役时是尖刀部队之一，后来又参加了某次的阻击战，他们经历的是胜利的道路，他们的连也因此成为一等功臣连。刘排长说，他们突击排的每个战士都爱护自己连队的荣誉，保证完成这次战斗任务。
    王团长静静地听完了刘排长的话，看一看表说：
    “时间不早了！”他推开饭碗站了起来，用手紧紧地按着刘排长的肩头。刘排长激动地说：
    “王团长，你的意思我全明白啦！五号山头既然已交给了我们，过一会儿那就再也不会是敌人的了。”
                                ×　×　×
    时间在静静地前进着。人们在紧张地等候着那个严肃的时刻……
    终于，在下午五时整，我军的炮火按照预定的计划开始射击了。
    一种震撼大地的声音突然响起，无数门大炮从数十里的纵深阵地上射出成吨成吨的钢铁，在同一个时间里砸到那片纵横三四百平方公尺的“六一一”阵地上，把敌人构筑了一年的工事和敌人的尸体一齐掀上半空。四十分钟以后，原是烟尘弥漫的敌人阵地上，已变成一片金星飞迸的火山。这时，王团长在电话里兴奋地向步兵指挥员们喊着：
    “问一问战士们，看见我们的炮火没有？我们的炮打得准不准确？”接着他又嘱咐指挥员们：“可要好好地打，狠狠地打啊！”
    五点五十四分，也正是我们的炮火开始延伸、步兵开始冲锋后的四分钟，“六一一”阵地上响起了一片激烈的枪声。这时，团指挥所里的同志们都在紧张而肃静地守在步行机旁。但是，听筒却一直喑哑着。怎么回事呢？……又过了一分钟，这一分钟简直比一个钟头的时间都长，步行机员的眼睛忽然亮了起来，他的声音也高得几乎改变了原来的声调：
    “是我啊！你是刘排长吗？怎么样？”他用一只手紧紧地按住左耳，大声地喊：“请你再说一遍，大点声音……啊！啊！”
    步行机“砰”的一声碰在用子弹箱搭成的棹子上，蜡烛倒了下来。
    “报告团长，刚才刘排长向你报告，一排在四分钟内全部占领了五号山头，现在正向六号山头进展。”
    王团长深深地吁了一口气，望着身边的同志们说：“好了，这一炮又打响了！”当六连长李元桂在步行机里向他报告战斗经过时，他回答：
    “命令三排同志向十号山头攻击！趁着敌人混乱的时候攻击！坚决的攻击！”
                                ×　×　×
    然而，就在这时，敌人的炮火已卷上了这片失掉的阵地。这些炮弹，挟着那些发着怪啸的破片，在由五号到十号山头的这条道路上，组成了一道严密的火墙。这种情况对于暴露在这条狭长山脊上进行攻击的六连三排的战士们是很不利的。但是，什么样的困难都阻挡不住我们的战士们。他们一边机灵地利用着打得蒙上厚土的残破的交通沟躲避炮弹，
    一边又奋不顾身地踏着敌人的尸体抢占“六一一”阵地上的那座楔入敌人纵深的十号山头。这是一场硬碰硬的恶战，因为就在这段一百多公尺的道路上，残存的地堡、盖沟里的敌人还在继续顽抗；而据守在十号阵地上的敌人也在进行反扑。但是，敌人的这些挣扎是没有用的；敌人的地堡一座一座地被炸塌了，正在凭险顽抗的敌人连武器都被炸飞了；
    一群反冲锋的敌人刚刚拥下十号山头，就遭到一阵密集的手榴弹和爆破筒的打击，人员和武器损失了
    一大半，剩下来的便举手投降了。
    六日晚上，六连七班班长兼机枪射手林顺和十八岁的弹药手吴文忠，跟着爆破组把机枪拉到十号山头上，一连打退敌人的十几次反扑。但是在第二天拂晓，吴文忠在敌人的最后一次冲锋中负伤了，血顺着胸口直往下流。林班长知道这个小鬼支持不住了，但是因为敌人正在冲锋，他没有时间替他的战友包扎伤口，仅能腾出左手来把他扶起来，靠在自己的肩膀上。小吴呢，也知道自己不行了，于是就用出了最后的一点力气来压完最后一盘子弹。七日上午，我在团指挥所里看到林顺同志，他是押俘虏到这里来的。他向我谈起他们当时战斗的情况说：
    “当时，我以为小吴还能支持一段时间呢，因为他从负伤到断气，一直没有喊一声疼。直到最后他还说：‘班长，你放心打吧！子弹我给你压。阵地咱们不能丢！’等到我把敌人打下去，才发现他已经牺牲在我的肩膀上了。我哭了，但我的劲头也就更大了，我要给小吴报仇。于是，我一盘子弹就撩倒了二十多个敌人……。”
                            ×　×　×
    七日以后，“六一一”阵地上的战斗进入了守备阶段，尽管敌人不断地用一个连到一个营的兵力进行连续反扑，但是我们的阵地却是不能动摇的。八日，在团指挥所里，步行机里不断地报告着敌人反扑的兵力和冲锋地点，而王团长却在有条不紊地下达着作战命令，使“六一一”阵地上我军歼敌的数字一次又一次地增加着。这是一场痛快的歼灭战，我军的炮火像旋风一样的翻卷在敌人向我冲锋的道路上，把那些正在冲锋或刚刚集结起来的敌人整连整排地打倒在地上。中午，正当敌人在报话机里大叫“敌人炮火凶猛”的时候，我军师首长却正在电话里向指挥炮兵的张副团长下达着作战命令：
    “刚才又给你们拨去一批炮弹，限你们在敌人下次的冲锋中把这些炮弹一气打完。这是命令！记住！一定要拣敌人密集的地方轰；炮弹不够时可来电话告诉我！”
    张副团长放下耳机子说：“卢参谋，通知炮群向十号正南方一百公尺的地方，来五个急速射！打的越狠越好！打吧！打吧！”
