Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 18th: Leading cadres of some state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Chongqing have conscientiously studied operations, changing their past leadership style of not delving deeply into reality. These factories and mines include the Steel Plant No. 102, Steel Plant No. 104, Steel Plant No. 101, Sichuan Cement Plant, and Paper Mill No. 601. Because the leading cadres of these plants and mines have carried out more specific and practical leadership over production, many key problems in production have been solved, output and quality have been continuously improved, and production management and business management are gradually being improved. For example, after the director and the Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Steel Plant No. 102 realized that the quality of steel ingots had to be solved, they carefully analyzed the reasons for the poor quality of steel ingots, and invited technicians and experienced veteran workers to study together. As a result, they not only discovered that the reason for the low quality of steel ingots was the uneven production in the steel ingot workshop, but also found that there were various ideas of neglecting quality among the workers. Therefore, on the one hand, they educated the workers and held exhibitions of defective products; on the other hand, they mobilized the workers to put forward rationalization proposals and actively improve product quality. After a series of reforms, the time for molten steel to enter the furnace was shortened, the cupola and electric furnace were improved, and the sand and ash inclusions in the steel ingots were reduced from 30% to 10%. Recently, 200 furnaces of steel have been smelted without any defects, gradually reaching the specifications stipulated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, and the output has also increased by 50%. Subsequently, they focused on solving the problem of refractory materials, and solved the technical operating procedures and technical supervision problems related to improving quality, which greatly advanced production management. The business level of the leading cadres of the plant has also been greatly improved through specific research work. Now, Steel Plant No. 102 has become a relatively advanced factory in the Southwest factories and mines.

The phenomenon of sand inclusion in the steel ingots of Steel Plant No. 104 had also not been solved for a long time. There was a time when the average sand inclusion of steel ingots in each furnace reached 30%. After He Long, Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructed at the Southwest Factory and Mine Conference in November last year that the leadership style must be changed, the leading cadres of Steel Plant No. 104 were determined to specifically divide the work to grasp several major problems in the plant's production. For example, when Zhao Tong, the director of the plant and secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee, studied the problem of sand inclusion, he read books on steelmaking and studied the previous experiments in detail. After a period of study, he found that reducing the amount of deoxidizer and aluminum in the molten steel would reduce the phenomenon of sand inclusion. At this time, he organized technicians and workers to form a special technical research group. After several experiments, the sand inclusion of steel ingots was greatly reduced. Later, Zhao Tong further relied on workers and technicians, resolutely implemented the Soviet cross-repair furnace method, implemented the sequential feeding procedure, strengthened the cooperation between shifts, and also solved the problem of shortening the smelting time. Now the time for smelting a furnace of steel has been shortened from seven to eight hours to about six hours.

In the past, the production of Sichuan Cement Plant was very abnormal, with output sometimes high and sometimes low, and the quality was very poor. After reviewing the shortcomings of not delving deeply into the work recently, the leading cadres of the plant also began to study operations. In the process of going deep into the masses of workers to understand the situation, they found that the key to affecting output and quality was the preparation of slurry. At this time, they actively carried out ideological education to the technicians and encouraged them to learn the Soviet advanced rotary kiln rapid rotation and thin burning method. As a result, the cement output exceeded the central government's target, and the quality was also improved compared to the past.

When the leading cadres of some factories and mines in Chongqing changed their leadership style, they resolutely overcame the ideological obstacles of being afraid of not being able to delve into the work. If they didn't understand the operations, they asked technicians and workers for advice. If they didn't understand the basic knowledge of industry, they asked technicians to teach them physics, chemistry, and various scientific principles. Because the leading cadres of these plants and mines actively learned and studied operations, and were able to pay attention to solving specific problems practically, the relationship between the leaders and the masses in these factories and mines is now closer than before, and the workers are also more united. The atmosphere of workers and technicians learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has also gradually been established.

    重庆部分国营和地方国营企业领导干部
    深入钻研业务解决生产关键问题
    【新华社重庆十八日电】重庆部分国营和地方国营工厂矿山的领导干部，认真钻研业务，转变了过去不深入实际的领导作风。这些工厂和矿山中有一零二钢铁厂、一零四钢铁厂、一零一钢铁厂、四川水泥厂和六零一纸厂等。由于这些厂矿的领导干部对生产进行了比较具体和切实的领导，许多生产中的关键问题都得到解决，产量质量不断提高，生产管理和经营管理也在逐步改善。如一零二钢铁厂厂长和中共党委副书记在认识到必须解决钢锭质量的问题以后，曾经详细地分析钢锭质量差的原因，邀集技术人员和有经验的老工人共同研究。结果，他们不但发觉钢锭质量不高的原因在于钢锭车间生产不均匀的问题，同时还发现职工中存有各种各样轻视质量的思想。于是，他们一方面向职工群众进行教育，举行了废品展览会；另一方面，他们又发动职工提出合理化建议，积极改善产品质量。经过一系列的改革，钢水进炉的时间缩短了，化铁炉和电炉得到了改进，钢锭中夹砂、夹灰也由百分之三十降低到百分之十，最近炼出的二百炉钢没有一点疵病，逐渐达到中央人民政府重工业部规定的规格，产量也提高了百分之五十。接着，他们又集中解决了耐火材料的问题，解决了和提高质量相关联的技术操作规程和技术监督问题，使生产管理大大前进了一步。该厂领导干部从具体钻研工作中，自己的业务水平也大大提高了。现在，一零二钢铁厂已成为西南厂矿中较先进的工厂。
    一零四钢铁厂钢锭夹砂的现象，也是长期没有得到解决的。曾有一个时期，每炉钢的钢锭平均夹砂达到百分之三十。中共中央西南局书记贺龙在去年十一月西南厂矿会议上指示必须转变领导作风后，一零四钢铁厂的领导干部就下定决心，具体分工掌握全厂生产中的几个重大问题。如该厂厂长兼中共党委书记赵彤在钻研夹砂问题时，一面阅读有关炼钢方面的书籍，一面详细了解和研究历次试验的情况。经过一段时间的钻研，他发现减少钢水中的脱氧剂和铝的用量，夹砂现象就会减少。这时，他又组织技术人员和工人成立了专门的技术研究小组，经过多次的试验，钢锭的夹砂大大减少了。后来，赵彤又进一步依靠工人和技术人员，坚决贯彻了苏联的交叉补炉法，实行了依次进料规程，加强了班和班的配合，同时还解决了缩短冶炼时间问题。现在每炼一炉钢已由七至八小时缩短到六小时左右。
    四川水泥厂过去生产很不正常，产量时高时低，质量很差。该厂领导干部最近在检讨了工作不深入的缺点后，也开始钻研业务。他们在深入职工群众了解情况中，发现影响产量和质量的关键是料浆的配制问题。这时，他们就积极地对技术人员进行了思想教育，鼓励他们学习苏联先进的旋窑快转薄烧法。这样，就使水泥产量超过了中央规定的指标，质量也比以前提高了。
    重庆部分工厂矿山领导干部在转变领导作风时，都坚决克服了怕钻不进去的思想障碍。不懂业务，他们就向技术人员和工人请教。不懂得工业方面的基础知识，他们就请技术人员给他们讲物理、化学和各种科学原理。由于这些厂矿的领导干部积极学习和钻研业务，并能注意切实解决具体问题，现在这些工厂矿山的领导和群众的关系，比以前更加密切了，职工之间也更加团结了。工人和技术人员学习苏联先进经验的风气，也逐渐树立起来了。
