(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th) The U.S. military command in Korea released a self-fabricated "intelligence report" on the 28th. This report maliciously cited many fabricated so-called "intelligence materials" and wantonly attacked our negotiation representatives, attempting to further and completely undermine the negotiations. It also tried to shirk the responsibility for the U.S. side's persecution and slaughter of prisoners of war, hoping to use this completely fabricated "report" to falsely accuse our side at the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly. However, the U.S. military command in Korea's methods of spreading rumors were so clumsy that, while making slanderous accusations, it also exposed its own despicable face.

This report, compiled single-handedly by the U.S. military command, absurdly attributed the U.S. side's bloody slaughter of prisoners of war on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, Bongam Island, and other U.S. prisoner of war camps entirely to "riots" "meticulously planned and directed" by our negotiation representatives. The report brazenly attacked our chief negotiation representative, General Nam Il, and our negotiation representative, General Lee Sang-jo, falsely claiming that they had so-called intelligence "connections" with our captured personnel in U.S. prisoner of war camps, saying they were "designated to plan events in the UN forces' prisoner of war camps." However, apart from many arbitrary speculations, the report could not provide any specific materials to prove the existence of this "connection." The report claimed with great seriousness that the Korean and Chinese sides sent a team of twelve people, carrying radios, to infiltrate near the prisoner of war camps to maintain contact with the prisoners of war. But how could prisoners of war in the tightly controlled U.S. camps, without radio equipment, contact this team? Even the U.S. military intelligence command, which is adept at spreading rumors and lies, could not explain this. Therefore, they simply did not explain it, but instead overturned their own lies to admit: "The coordination of events may not be easy." If that is the case, how could prisoners of war receive General Nam Il's instructions to "riot"? Thus, the U.S. military command recklessly said in its fabricated report: "But the leaders among the prisoners of war are very familiar with the aims and methods of the Party and the Communist army command, so they don't need to receive instructions to know that events can be exploited at any time." Thus, it can be seen that the "planning" and "instructions" of General Nam Il and General Lee Sang-jo were completely unnecessary for the prisoners of war's struggle, and the two of them would never be so busy as to do such unnecessary things. In fact, these so-called "planning" and "instructions" are the U.S. aggressors' policies of "screening," slaughtering, and mistreating prisoners of war, which forced the prisoners of war to risk their lives to resist and struggle.

Apart from these absurd lies, the only basis for this report is the so-called "captured documents," "prisoners of war confessions," and "Communist correspondence," all of which were also fabricated by U.S. intelligence agencies. But the U.S. aggressors' fabrications are, as usual, so childish and ridiculous, full of loopholes. The U.S. military command is trying to make the world believe that the U.S. military "respects" the Geneva Convention, "but the Communists do not respect this convention." To this end, they wrote many self-contradictory and obviously U.S.-fabricated words into their fabricated "documents" and "confessions." The report quoted a so-called "summary of the achievements of the large-scale escape incident of prisoners of war on Bongam Island on December 14, 1952," trying to make people believe that this unprecedented massacre was the result of prisoners of war attempting a "large-scale escape." It is very clear that the U.S. side is trying to continue to conceal the truth of the Bongam Island incident by pretending to be the voice of the prisoners of war. However, the fabricators apparently forgot the well-known fact that Miller, the commander of the U.S. Bongam Island prisoner of war camp, had already admitted that the Bongam Island incident occurred because the U.S. side forcibly moved prisoners of war. This confession cannot be covered up by such a fabricated "summary." What is particularly laughable is that the U.S. fabricators actually put their own words on the prisoners of war, completely exposing the fabricators' trickery. In the U.S. military command in Korea's report, it said that our prisoners of war called the Syngman Rhee gang the "Republic of Korea," and that our prisoners of war also said, "If the UN forces' soldiers enter the camp, they will not be allowed to shoot, because this violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention." Naturally, everyone knows that our prisoners of war could not say such things. They know very well that the so-called "Republic of Korea" is just the U.S. side's title for the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, and they also know very well that the U.S. aggressor army is a complete violator of the Geneva Convention, and they themselves are often targets shot at by these aggressor armies. The U.S. military command's shameful and clumsy methods only make the world see through the falsified nature of this so-called "summary."

The U.S. military command's report attempts to portray the prisoners of war's mass and just struggles to resist the U.S. side's forced "screening" as conspiracies instigated by certain prisoner of war "leaders." The report attempts to give the impression that it is not all prisoners of war who oppose forced "screening," but only a few prisoner of war "leaders." To this end, the report specifically created a person named Gong Wenyi (transliteration). The report said, "The prisoners of war said that he controlled all the camps and personally ordered the detention of General Dodd." (We remember that the U.S. military has repeatedly said that, according to the prisoners of war, the person who directed the detention of Dodd was a Li Hangu, but now it has changed again.) In order to make things more vivid, the report added: "It is said that he also instigated riots in Camp 77 on May 27, 1951, and March 18, 1952, to oppose voluntary repatriation screening." The U.S. intelligence agency was obviously so carried away with lying that it carelessly revealed two incidents of slaughtering prisoners of war on May 27, 1951, and March 18, 1952, which the U.S. side has never revealed until now. These two incidents of slaughtering prisoners of war revealed by the U.S. intelligence agency are particularly noteworthy. Everyone knows that on May 27, 1951, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, had not yet proposed a proposal for armistice negotiations in Korea, and there was not even a shadow of armistice negotiations. Even after the armistice negotiations had already been held, according to the U.S. side's Acheson's words to the world at the 7th United Nations General Assembly last year, the U.S. side began "screening" prisoners of war in April 1952. But now, the U.S. military command has not only slapped Acheson in the face but also simply admitted that they had already conducted "voluntary repatriation screening" in May 1951, when there was no sign of armistice negotiations. This completely confirms that the U.S. side had already decided to create disputes over the prisoner of war issue before the start of the armistice negotiations in order to achieve its goal of prolonging the Korean War.

The U.S. side's report incoherently said a lot of lies about prisoner of war "riots," prisoner of war "manufacturing propaganda materials that might affect the Panmunjom armistice negotiations," and prisoner of war "controlling all camps," but in the end, it slapped itself in the face and admitted that it was the U.S. intelligence agency that was strictly controlling the prisoner of war camps and conducting espionage activities in the prisoner of war camps. The report admitted that the U.S. side "divided the prisoners of war into many smaller and more easily managed batches, further strengthened actual security around the camps, expanded the intelligence system for each camp, strengthened strict control, conducted more frequent inspections and searches as needed, and implemented curfews." But even so, the report admitted that the U.S. spies still could not force the prisoners of war to give up their loyalty to their motherland.

The result of the U.S. military command's rumors and slanders is that it has fallen into an inextricable quagmire of logical confusion. On the one hand, it insists that our negotiation representatives have "connections" with the prisoners of war in the U.S. prisoner of war camps, but on the other hand, it cannot provide any evidence to prove this and admits that this "connection" is impossible. On the one hand, it says that the prisoner of war "leaders" control all the U.S. prisoner of war camps, but on the other hand, it admits that the prisoner of war camps are under the strict control of the U.S. side. All these self-contradictory nonsense vividly portray the rogue face of the U.S. aggressors, who are accustomed to turning black into white and using the means of slander and sophistry.

Observers here solemnly pointed out that just as the U.S. side is stepping up preparations to expand the war and arbitrarily destroying negotiation agreements, the U.S. military command suddenly fabricated such a report, the purpose of which is not only to shirk the responsibility for slaughtering prisoners of war and to create excuses for continuing to slaughter prisoners of war. The U.S. side recently tore up the agreement on the inviolability of the delegation's vehicles and refused to assume responsibility for destroying the conference area agreement. Now, it is arrogantly and wantonly attacking our negotiation representatives. This is obviously one of the steps in the U.S. side's planned destruction of the armistice negotiations, and its purpose is to create excuses to make the negotiations finally break down. Not only that, the U.S. side also attempts to use such a set of lies completely fabricated by the U.S. side to continue to deny its responsibility for using the prisoner of war issue to undermine the negotiations and to falsely accuse the Korean and Chinese sides at the 7th United Nations General Assembly, which will reconvene in late February, in order to induce other countries to agree to the U.S. policy of replacing armistice negotiations with military adventures. The U.S. side obviously knows that all these fabricated nonsense cannot withstand scrutiny and confrontation. Therefore, it has to take out this report in the name of "intelligence summary," attempting to use the guise of "secret military report" to escape the condemnation of the world. However, the U.S. side's report, which is full of loopholes, has already fully demonstrated that it cannot deceive anyone, and its conspiracy is bound to fail. The U.S. side's desperate attempt to find a way out from absurd rumors and slanders fully shows that it has reached a dead end under the unanimous condemnation of the people of the world.

    侵朝美军司令部发表自相矛盾的所谓“情报报告”
    阴谋彻底破坏谈判竟肆意攻击我方代表
    【新华社开城三十日电】侵朝美军司令部在二十八日发表了一篇由他们自己编造出来的“情报报告”，这篇报告用心险恶地引用了许多捏造出来的所谓“情报材料”，肆意攻击我方谈判代表，企图进一步彻底破坏谈判，并竭力推脱美方迫害屠杀战俘的责任，想凭这个完全捏造的“报告”在即将复会的联合国大会上对我方进行诬告。但是，侵朝美军司令部的造谣手法是如此拙劣，以致它在含血喷人的时候，同时暴露了自己的卑劣面目。
    这个由美军司令部一手编成的报告，荒谬绝伦地把美方在巨济岛、济州岛、蜂岩岛以及其他美方战俘营中血腥屠杀战俘的罪行，一古脑儿说成是我方谈判代表“所缜密策划和指导的”“暴动”。报告肆无忌惮地对我方首席谈判代表南日将军和我方谈判代表李相朝将军进行人身攻击，硬说他们和美方战俘营中的我方被俘人员有所谓情报“联系”，说他们“被指定来策划联军战俘营中的事件”。但是报告除了许多武断的臆测以外，却提供不出任何具体材料来证明这种“联系”的存在。这个报告煞有介事地说，朝中方面派了有十二个人的一队人，带了无线电渗入到战俘营附近，和战俘保持联络，可是在美军严密控制下的没有无线电设备的战俘如何能与这一队人联络呢？连以造谣撒谎为能事的美军特务司令部也无法交代。因此他们干脆就不交代，却转而推翻自己的谎言来承认：“事件的联系配合可能是不大容易的”。既然如此，战俘如何能接到南日将军的指示来“暴动”呢？于是美军司令部就在他们所捏造的报告中信口开河地说：“但是战俘中间的领袖们对于党和共军司令部的目的和方法是很熟悉的，所以他们用不着接到指示就可以知道事件在任何时间都能加以利用。”这样，可见南日将军和李相朝将军的“策划”和“指示”对于战俘的斗争根本是不需要的，他们两个人也绝不会在百忙中来干这种毫无需要的事。事实上这些所谓“策划”和“指示”就是美国侵略者的“甄别”、屠杀和虐待战俘的政策，它使战俘不能不拚着性命来反抗和斗争。
    除了这类不值一驳的鬼话而外，这个报告的唯一根据就是同样由美国特务机关捏造出来的所谓“缴获的文件”、“战俘的口供”、“共产党的通信”。但是美国侵略者的这种捏造照例又是如此幼稚可笑，漏洞百出。美军司令部企图要全世界相信，美国军队是“尊重”日内瓦公约的，“但共产党却不尊重这个公约”。为了这个目的，他们在自己编造的“文件”和“口供”中写进去了许多自相矛盾和一望而知是美方自己编造的话。这个报告引用了一个所谓从战俘缴获得来的“综述一九五二年十二月十四日蜂岩岛战俘大规模逃跑事件的成绩的抄写的总结”，企图使人相信这一次空前的屠杀事件是战俘企图“大规模逃跑”的结果。十分明显，美方是企图冒充战俘的嘴来继续隐瞒蜂岩岛事件的真相，但是造谣者显然忘记了人所周知的事实，就是：美方蜂岩岛战俘营司令米勒早已承认蜂岩岛事件是因为美方强迫迁移战俘而发生的。这一供认决不是这么一张捏造出来的“总结”掩盖得了的。尤其令人发笑的，美国造谣者竟把他们自己的话硬安在战俘身上，从而完全露出了造谣者的马脚。侵朝美军司令部的这篇报告中，说我方战俘称李承晚匪帮为“大韩民国”，称我方战俘还说什么“假若联合国军的士兵进入营场时，他们是不会被允许开枪的，因为这违反日内瓦公约的规定”。自然，谁都知道，我方的战俘不可能说这样的话。他们深知所谓“大韩民国”只是美方对李承晚傀儡的称号，他们也更深知美国侵略军是日内瓦公约的彻底违反者，他们自己是经常被这些侵略军开枪射击的目标。美军司令部的这种可耻而拙劣的手法，只是使全世界看穿了这个所谓“总结”的伪造性质罢了。
    美军司令部的报告企图把战俘们为反抗美方强迫“甄别”而进行的群众性的正义斗争，都说成是某些战俘“领袖”主使的阴谋。这个报告企图给人这样一种印象，这就是：反对强迫“甄别”的并不是全体战俘，而只是少数战俘“领袖”。为了这个目的，报告特地造出了一个名叫龚文一（译音）的人。报告说，“战俘们说他控制了所有的营场，并且亲自下令扣留杜德将军。”（我们记得美军曾多次说据战俘说指挥扣留杜德的是一个李涵谷，现在又变了。）为了把事情说得更加活灵活现、报告添油加醋地说：“据说，一九五一年五月二十七日以及一九五二年三月十八日在第七十七号营场内煽动暴动反对进行自愿遣返甄别的事，也是由他主使的。”美国特务机关显然撒谎撒得忘其所以了，以致不小心又透露出了迄今美方从未透露过的一九五一年五月二十七日以及一九五二年三月十八日的两次屠杀战俘事件。美国特务机关透露出来的这两次屠杀事件是特别值得人们注意的。大家都晓得在一九五一年五月二十七日，苏联驻联合国代表马立克还没提出在朝鲜进行停战谈判的提案，停战谈判还连影子都没有。就是在停战谈判已经举行之后，照美国的艾奇逊在去年第七届联合国大会上告诉全世界的话，美方开始“甄别”战俘是在一九五二年四月里，但是现在美军司令部却不仅打了艾奇逊一记耳光，而且干脆承认他们早在一九五一年五月间，停战谈判还毫无踪影的时候，就已经进行“自愿遣返甄别”了。这就完全证实了美方早在停战谈判开始之前已经决心要在战俘问题上制造纠纷，以便达到其把朝鲜战争延长下去的目的。
    美方的这个报告语无伦次地说了一大堆关于战俘
    “暴动”、战俘“制造或许会影响板门店停战谈判的宣传材料”、战俘“控制所有营场”的谎话，最后却自己打自己的嘴巴，承认严密控制战俘营，在战俘营中进行特务活动的不是别人，恰恰就是美国特务机关。这个报告承认，美方“把战俘分成人数较少并比较容易管制的许多批，在营场周围进一步加强实际安全，扩大对于各营场的情报系统，加强严格的管制，按照需要的情况，更经常地进行检查和搜查，并实行宵禁”。但是，纵然如此，报告承认，美国特务们仍然无法强迫战俘放弃他们对于祖国的忠诚。
    美军司令部造谣诬蔑的结果，使自己陷入了无法自拔的逻辑混乱的泥淖。它一方面硬说我方谈判代表和美方战俘营中的战俘有“联系”，另一方面却又举不出任何证据来，而且承认这种“联系”是不可能的事情。它一方面说战俘“领袖”控制了所有美方战俘营，另一方面却又承认战俘营是在美方的严密控制之下。这一切自相矛盾的胡言乱语，活画出了惯耍指黑为白、诬陷狡赖手段的美国侵略者的流氓脸相。
    此间观察家郑重指出，正当美方加紧准备扩大战争，任意破坏谈判协议的时候，美军司令部突然捏造出这样一个报告来，其目的不仅在于推脱屠杀战俘的责任，为继续屠杀战俘制造借口而已。美方最近撕毁了关于代表团车辆不受攻击的协议，并拒绝承担破坏会场区协议的责任，现在又狂妄地肆意攻击我方谈判代表，这显然是美方有计划破坏停战谈判的步骤之一，其目的是要制造借口来使谈判最后破裂。不仅如此，美方还企图利用这么一套完全由美方自己捏造出来的谎言，在二月下旬复会的第七届联合国大会上继续抵赖利用战俘问题破坏谈判的责任，并对朝中方面进行诬告，以便诱使其他国家同意美国的用军事冒险代替停战谈判的政策。美方显然知道，所有这些捏造出来的鬼话都是经不起审查和对证的，因此它不得不用“情报总结”的名义拿出这份报告来，企图用“秘密的军事报告”的幌子来逃避全世界的责难。但是，美方这个破绽百出的报告本身，就已经充分说明它是欺骗不了任何人的，它的阴谋必然要遭到失败。美方这样穷极无聊地企图从荒诞无稽的造谣诬蔑中找寻出路，充分说明它在全世界人民的一致谴责下，已经走头无路了。
