Model Military Family Member Dong Guangtian

Throughout the country, the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, under the care and love of governments at all levels and the people, and through their own hard work, are enjoying lofty honor and their lives have greatly improved. Among them, a large number of model figures have emerged, who are particularly loved by the people. The slogan "Sons and daughters are heroes at the front, families are models in the rear" has become the goal of the vast number of military families. Dong Guangtian, a military family member from Shenji Mafang Village, Third District, Xianghe County, Hebei Province, is one of these model figures. (Attached picture)

	I. Dong Guangtian's family (from left: Dong Guangtian, his third son Dong Chun, his wife, youngest daughter Xiu Rong, fourth son Dong Gui, cousin Guangda, father Dong Ru) are holding a family meeting to revise their patriotic pact: Work hard to participate in the patriotic production movement, organize mutual aid in production among military families, and frequently write letters to his younger brother Dong Guangxiang and eldest son Dong Shen at the front to report on the family's production situation, encouraging them to work hard to kill the enemy and strive for even greater glory.

	II. Dong Guangtian organized a long-term mutual aid group with another military family and two households of elderly and widowed people, cultivating the land meticulously and improving farming techniques. In 1952, they achieved a bumper harvest, with cotton yields exceeding 700 jin per mu, and other crops also exceeding average yields. Dong Guangtian was elected as a labor model. The county awarded him a new-style walking plow, and the province awarded him a waterwheel, a corn thresher, and a sprayer. This is a scene of agricultural extension station personnel teaching him how to use these new farm tools.

	III. Life has become prosperous. Dong Guangtian's second son, Dong Zhen, brought back large bundles of cloth from Beijing to make new clothes for the family. Dad, Mom, and younger sister are all happy: "This cloth is very beautiful and thick."

	IV. Dong Guangtian is not satisfied with last year's bumper harvest and is using the winter slack season to dig pit mud and send it to the fields to improve the soil quality, striving for an even greater harvest this year to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the country's large-scale economic construction.

    全国各地的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人，在各级人民政府和人民群众的关怀和爱护下，在他们自己的努力生产下，他们享受着崇高的荣誉，生活也有了很大的改善。他们中涌现了大批的模范人物，特别受到人民群众的爱戴。“子弟在前方当英雄，家属在后方当模范”这句口号，已成为广大军属努力的目标。河北省香河县三区神机马房村军属董广田，就是这些模范人物当中的一个。（附图片）
    一、董广田全家（左起：董广田、他的三儿董春、他的妻、幼女秀荣、四儿董桂、堂弟广达、父亲董儒）正在举行家庭会议，修订爱国公约：努力参加爱国丰产运动，组织军属互助生产，经常写信给在前方的弟弟董广祥和大儿子董深报告家中生产情况，鼓励他们努力杀敌，争取光荣上加光荣。
    二、董广田和另一户军属、两户孤寡组织了长期互助组，精耕细作，并改进耕作技术，一九五二年得到了大丰收，棉花每亩收七百多斤，其他作物也都超过一般产量。董广田当选了劳动模范。县里奖给他一具新式步犁，省里奖给他一架水车，一具玉米脱粒机和一架喷雾器。这是农业推广站人员正在教给他使用这些新农具的方法的情形。
    三、生活富裕起来了。董广田的二儿子董珍从北京带回了大捆布匹，给家人做新衣服。爸爸、妈妈、妹妹都乐了：“这布挺好看、挺厚实的。”
    四、董广田不满足于去年的丰收，正在冬闲时间挖坑泥，送到地里改良土质，争取今年更大的丰收，支援抗美援朝斗争和祖国大规模的经济建设。
