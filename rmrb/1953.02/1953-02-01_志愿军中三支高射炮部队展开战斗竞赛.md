Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 31st: Three anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers recently launched a combat competition to promote revolutionary heroism. In the competition, they inflicted heavier blows on the American aerial bandits invading North Korean airspace.

This competition began after an anti-aircraft artillery unit, which had won the Second Class Merit, issued a challenge to shoot down enemy planes. This unit had fought fiercely with more than 360 enemy aircraft in thirteen hours when thwarting a key enemy bombing raid, shooting down and damaging twenty-five enemy planes. Their challenge was enthusiastically responded to by two other anti-aircraft artillery units with outstanding records, and they established the conditions for the competition to shoot down enemy planes.

The anti-aircraft artillery unit that won the Second Class Merit shot down a B-26 enemy plane the day after receiving the acceptance of the challenge—December 26th of last year. On the 27th, the enemy sent eight F-84 fighter planes to attack their position. Before the enemy planes could dive, they used artillery fire to shoot down and damage one enemy plane each.

Another anti-aircraft artillery unit also actively sought opportunities to strike at American aerial bandits after issuing their letter of acceptance. While celebrating the New Year's Day, they also seized the opportunity to wound an enemy plane flying over their position. On the morning of January 3rd, ten enemy planes dropped bombs on villages near their position, and they immediately used fierce firepower to block the enemy planes' dive routes, knocking an enemy plane out of the sky. At this time, thirty-two F-84 enemy planes appeared in the sky, diving to drop bombs on the ground in two intersecting routes. The gunners immediately split up to meet the diving enemy planes. One gun fired three shells in a row, all hitting one enemy plane, which fell with flames. Later, the enemy planes changed to four diving routes, and the gunners on the position fired even more shells. After a fierce battle of fifty-five minutes, the enemy planes were driven away. The heroic anti-aircraft artillerymen achieved a victory of shooting down and damaging three enemy planes each in this air defense operation.

    志愿军中三支高射炮部队展开战斗竞赛
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】有三支中国人民志愿军的高射炮部队最近展开了发扬革命英雄主义的战斗竞赛。他们在竞赛中使侵入到北朝鲜天空中的美国空中强盗受到了更加沉重的打击。
    这个竞赛是在荣立二等功的某高射炮部队提出打敌机的挑战书以后开始的。这支部队在粉碎敌人重点轰炸时曾与三百六十多架次的敌机激战十三小时，击落击伤敌机二十五架。当时他们的挑战书得到了另外两支战绩卓著的高射炮部队的热烈响应，订立了打敌机的竞赛条件。
    这支荣立二等功的高射炮部队，在接到应战书的第二天——去年十二月二十六日，就打下了一架B二六型的敌机。二十七日，敌人又派八架F八十四型战斗机来袭击他们的阵地。他们在敌机还来不及俯冲时就用炮火打落打伤了敌机各一架。
    另一支高射炮部队在提出应战书后，也积极寻找战机打击美国空中强盗。他们在元旦欢庆新年的时候，还抓紧时机打伤了一架飞过阵地上空的敌机。一月三日上午，十架敌机向他们阵地附近的村庄投弹，他们又立即以猛烈的火力封锁住敌机的俯冲路线，把一架敌机打得从空中掉了下来。这时，天空又出现了三十二架F八十四型的敌机，它们分成两路交叉着向地面俯冲投弹。炮手们立即分头迎击俯冲的敌机。一门炮一连三发炮弹都打在一架敌机上，那架敌机冒着红火掉了下来。以后，敌机又改成四路俯冲，阵地上的炮手们也打出了更多的炮弹。激战五十五分钟，敌机被打跑了。英勇的高射炮兵们在这次对空作战中，取得了击落击伤敌机各三架的胜利。
