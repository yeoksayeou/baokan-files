    Snowfall in Most Parts of the Country

    [Reported by this newspaper] Starting on January 30th, most parts of our country experienced snowfall, with heavier snowfall on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway in Hebei and Henan provinces, equivalent to approximately 4 to 5 millimeters of precipitation. Some areas in the southwest also experienced rainfall, with a maximum of about 20 millimeters. This is the first major snowfall since the beginning of winter. Although the amount is not large, the scope is extensive, which will play a certain role in this year's wheat harvest, moisture conservation in arid land, and reduction of insect pests. People's governments at all levels should promptly lead the masses to accumulate snow to conserve moisture.

    全国大部地区先后降雪
    【本报讯】一月三十日开始，我国大部地区先后降雪，其中以河北、河南两省京汉铁路两侧较大，折合降水量约四到五公厘。西南并有部分地区降雨，最高约二十公厘。这是入冬以来第一次的大雪，数量虽然不多，但范围很广，对今年的小麦丰产、旱地保墒、减轻虫害将会起一定的作用。各级人民政府应该及时领导群众积雪保墒。
