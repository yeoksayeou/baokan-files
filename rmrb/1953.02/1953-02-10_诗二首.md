Two Poems
冯至

In the early spring of 1950, I stayed in Budapest for ten days, living on Margaret Island and strolling along the Danube. My Hungarian friends repeatedly spoke to me about the hardships of those years: how the German fascist bandits occupied both banks of the river. Many buildings were burned down, and all the bridges were blown up; every citizen of Budapest had a painful experience.

In the winter of 1952, I stayed here for one night. The Austrian border train stopped at the Austrian border. We left the enthusiastic and happy Hungary, where everyone was full of joy and confidence. Here it was cold and quiet, and everything was sighing.

The beautiful Margaret Island was as familiar as before. But the conversations of my Hungarian friends had changed greatly, only describing the construction of the past two and a half years, no longer mentioning the hardships of the past. New bridges were built over the Danube, and tunnels were being dug under the Danube. The future underground station would be as beautiful as Moscow. Construction made new miracles appear one after another before our eyes, pushing the hardships of seven years ago as if they were seventy years ago.

In front of a house in Austria, two children stared at us with wide eyes. They looked at the strangers in the car, and their little hearts seemed to ask: "Where did you come from? Why did you come here?" Their view ahead was blurred, and they didn't understand our intentions either.

Looking at their gaze, I thought of the Soviet and Hungarian children, shouting "China" to us in different languages, and shouting "Mao Zedong" in the same voice. These children all have a definite path, and there is infinite beauty in front of them; our train travels a thousand miles and another thousand miles, and they know it is to strive for peace.

But these two children were so silent, and their silence also aroused my questions: What kind of path will you take in the future? What kind of fate will you encounter in the future? What do your parents tell you every day? What knowledge do your teachers give you? Will you be cannon fodder for the executioners? Or will you become fighters for national independence and peace?"

The train stopped at the Austrian border. I wanted to get off the train and tell these two children many stories that eastern children love to hear, so that they can be as cheerful as the eastern children.

    诗二首
    冯至布达佩斯一九五零年的初春，我在这里住过十天，住在马尔基特岛上，散步在多瑙河边。匈牙利的朋友一再地和我谈起当年的苦难：德国的法西斯匪徒怎样盘据着河的两岸。许多的建筑被烧毁，所有的桥梁都被炸断；每个布达佩斯的市民都有一段痛苦的经验。一九五二年的冬天，我在这里住了一夜，奥  地  利  边  境列车停在奥地利的边境，我们离开了热情的、幸福的匈牙利，那边人人都充满了欢悦和信心，这里冷冷清清，一切都在叹息。美丽的马尔基特岛，和从前一样地亲切。匈牙利朋友的谈话却有了很大的改变，只述说两年半的建设，再不提当年的苦难。多瑙河上建筑了新桥，多瑙河下正开凿隧道，将来的地下车站要像莫斯科那样美好。建设使新的奇迹一件件在面前出现，它把七年前的苦难，好像推到七十年前。在一座奥地利的房屋门前，两个孩子睁大眼睛望着我们，他们望着车里的外乡人，小小的心里好像发出来疑问：“你们从什么地方走来？为什么来到我们这里？”他们的面前是一片模糊，他们也不明白我们的来意。我望着他们凝视的目光，想起苏联的、匈牙利的儿童，向我们用不同的语言喊着“中国”，用同样的声音高呼毛泽东。这些儿童都有一定的道路，他们的面前有无限的美景；我们的列车走了一千里又是一千里，他们知道是为了争取和平。但是这两个孩子却是这样沉默，他们的沉默也引起我的疑问：你们将来会走上什么样的途程？你们将来会碰到什么样的命运？你们的父母天天向你们说些什么？你们的教师给你们些什么知识？你们会不会给刽子手充当炮灰？可是会成为民族独立与和平的战士？”列车停在奥地利的边境，我想走下车，向这两个孩子讲一讲许多东方儿童爱听的故事，让他们和东方的儿童一样地明朗。
