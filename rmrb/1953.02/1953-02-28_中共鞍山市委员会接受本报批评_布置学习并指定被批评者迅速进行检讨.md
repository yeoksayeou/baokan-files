The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Secretary Han Tianshi, conducted a collective study of the article "Anshan 'Worker Life' Newspaper Encounters Serious Obstruction from Bureaucrats in Carrying Out Criticism," published in this newspaper on February 6th. All members also conducted self-criticism in light of their actual work during the study. The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee also notified the Party organizations of all departments in Anshan City to immediately organize discussions and studies of this criticism.

The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee Secretary Han Tianshi and all members believe that the criticism raised by this newspaper in the article "Anshan 'Worker Life' Newspaper Encounters Serious Obstruction from Bureaucrats in Carrying Out Criticism" is completely correct. They unanimously expressed their sincere acceptance and will promptly and earnestly conduct a public self-criticism and correction. In particular, those who were criticized must immediately conduct a public self-criticism. The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee will deal with them separately based on the degree of their self-criticism and correction of errors. At the same time, the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee also believes that, through this study and self-criticism, a city-wide, bottom-up criticism and public criticism in newspapers should be widely carried out, attracting the vast number of workers and people to expose the shortcomings and errors in various work in Anshan City, so as to ensure the completion of Anshan City's huge economic construction tasks. To this end, the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee issued a notice on February 11, instructing all subordinate Party committees to start with resolutely carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially public, bottom-up criticism, to further deepen the city's struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. The notice specifically stipulates: 1. Party committees at all levels should organize and lead cadres above the basic level to re-study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" in April 1950, in conjunction with studying Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and study Chairman Mao's speech at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC and Comrade An Ziwen's report on "We Must Launch a Resolute Struggle Against Bureaucracy, Commandism, and Violations of Law and Discipline Throughout the Country and at All Levels of Organs." 2. All units and individuals who have not publicly responded to newspaper criticisms in the past must respond quickly, otherwise they will be punished for violating discipline. 3. Party committees at all levels should convey this notice from the Municipal Party Committee to the党员and all personnel of their units, calling on them to take the attitude of masters of the country, in order to cherish the Party, strengthen economic construction, improve work, and improve leadership, to bravely fight against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline, and currently to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all behaviors of resisting, suppressing, or retaliating against criticism. The Municipal Party Committee will resolutely support them.
