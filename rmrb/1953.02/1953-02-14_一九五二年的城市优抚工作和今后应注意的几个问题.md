    Urban Preferential Treatment Work in 1952 and Several Issues to be Noted in the Future
    Preferential Treatment Department, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Central People's Government
    Under the promotion of the great movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the urban preferential treatment work in 1952 achieved great success. In 1952, due to the further strengthening of patriotic education, the masses loved the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers even more, and respected the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers even more. All organs, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, hospitals, and people from all walks of life incorporated the work of preferential treatment into patriotic pacts, realizing timely medical treatment for the illnesses of families of martyrs and soldiers, festive condolences, preferential treatment for shopping, and solving their various difficulties, and improving the political status of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. Various localities implemented the policy of introducing employment and organizing production as the main focus, supplemented by material assistance, so that the vast majority of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers participated in production and obtained employment. For example, in Tianjin, a total of 9,094 families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers were employed through government introductions in 1952, an increase of more than 80% compared to 1951, exceeding the total number of people employed in the past three years; moreover, half of them were long-term workers, learning skills in larger factories. For the elderly and widowed families of martyrs and soldiers who could not participate in production, the municipal people's governments allocated pensions and adopted key subsidy methods to ensure their livelihoods. The issue of school enrollment for the children of martyrs and soldiers has also been largely resolved. For example, in 1952, Hangzhou helped 454 children of martyrs and soldiers enter middle school and 1,087 children enter elementary school, based on the economic situation of the families of martyrs and soldiers, through public funding scholarships or tuition reduction and exemption.
    In order to consolidate the existing achievements and further improve the work of preferential treatment, the following issues should be focused on and resolved in the future urban preferential treatment work:
    1.  Attach importance to and do a good job in introducing employment for families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. Experience over the past year has proven that in some large and medium-sized cities with relatively developed industries, introducing them to long-term and fixed jobs is more effective than organizing them to engage in production independently. The advantage is that they can have fixed jobs, serve the people like soldiers, and be trained and educated in their work. It can also give them higher and fixed incomes, and at the same time, it can solve the difficulty of civil affairs cadres lacking experience in leading production. Tianjin has done a better job in this regard. First, they clarified the policy of focusing on introducing employment. With the support of the leading organs, they emphasized the priority of employment for families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and persuaded and mobilized units that did not attach importance to absorbing families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers to participate in work. Moreover, the implementation of the priority of employment was emphasized during inspections of preferential treatment work during major festivals. In 1951, the inspection team organized by the city inspected more than 100 larger factories, and in 1952, it inspected more than 200 factories. Through several inspections, the leaders of the factories have gradually begun to attach importance to it. Second, with a spirit of being responsible to the end, they dispelled the concerns of the factories, explained to the units that were afraid that the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers would be difficult to lead, and seriously mobilized and explained to the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers before the introduction. The government also actively educated individual families of martyrs and soldiers or revolutionary disabled soldiers who did not obey the leadership of the factory or emphasized their own demands, reducing the difficulties of the factory. Third, a survey and registration of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers with employment conditions was carried out, and job cards were established so that the leading organs could grasp the situation and introduce jobs according to the conditions. Fourth, close cooperation with the labor employment department was maintained. When there were employment opportunities, the labor exchange would allocate appropriate quotas to families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers and notify the civil affairs bureau to distribute and deploy them to various districts. In order to make the connection closer, the Tianjin Civil Affairs Bureau also sent cadres to work in the labor exchange to grasp this work. Therefore, the principle of giving priority to the recruitment of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers has been generally implemented in 110 larger enterprises in the city, and 39 units have also relaxed the recruitment conditions. The state-owned Electrical Engineering North Factory has absorbed 202 families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to participate in work, accounting for 30% of the total number of employees in the factory. The private Weidi Pharmaceutical Factory also gave priority to the recruitment of 72 people, accounting for 31% of all employees. These factories not only provided care in life and accommodation for the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers who entered the factory, but also the employees helped them, enabling them to quickly master the technology and become skilled technical workers. Wuhan adopted the method of actively contacting the Labor Bureau, cooperating with each other, and maintaining frequent contact with various factories and enterprises, and absorbing relevant departments to participate in the representative meetings of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, which obtained the widespread support of various departments and people from all walks of life. As a result, 1,748 families of martyrs and soldiers were introduced to work in 1952. However, the civil affairs departments of some cities only complained that "there is no way if people do not recruit", and did not actively strive for the support of relevant departments and social forces, resulting in little effect in introducing employment. Even in cities with better employment introduction work, there are still some families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers who could have the opportunity to participate in work but have not yet obtained jobs.
    From the above experience, it can be seen that the key to introducing employment is, on the one hand, to make the heads of various organs, factories, and enterprises realize the importance of doing a good job in preferential treatment, and welcome the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers to participate in the work of their units. At the same time, it is necessary to obtain the close cooperation of the Labor Employment Committee so that the families of martyrs and soldiers can effectively enjoy the priority of employment. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen ideological education for the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, overcome the thinking of being meritorious and the thinking of despising labor among some of them, cultivate their employment skills, and create convenient conditions for their employment. The method of Beijing holding political study classes for families of martyrs and soldiers to improve their political awareness and policy level, and the method of Hangzhou mobilizing more than 100 families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in accounting cram schools to learn technology, are worthy of research and promotion.
    2.  Pay attention to the organization and leadership of the production of families of martyrs and soldiers. Due to the different economic development situations in various cities, it is not possible to completely rely on introducing employment to solve the livelihood problems of families of martyrs and soldiers in cities with few industries. Moreover, due to the limitations of the families of martyrs and soldiers themselves (such as being too old, weak, etc.), even in industrially developed cities, the method of introducing employment cannot completely solve all the problems. Therefore, organizing the production of families of martyrs and soldiers is still an important task in urban preferential treatment work. Based on the experience of the past year, the following should be noted when organizing the production of families of martyrs and soldiers:
    (1) Master the principles of using less funds, accommodating more people, easy-to-learn rough work, sufficient raw material supply, broad sales channels, and being able to develop. For example, the Changsha umbrella factory initially invested 150 million yuan, accommodating more than 80 apprentice workers from families of martyrs and soldiers, ranging in age from 15 to 45, most of whom were women. After six months of study, they were able to independently master a technology. The raw materials were generally supplied sufficiently, and the sales channels were very good, so it was consolidated and developed.
    (2) It is better to solve the production funds by absorbing the idle funds of families of martyrs and soldiers, mobilizing them to raise funds or bring their own production tools, etc., and then the government or the masses will help when necessary. For example, among the 14 military-affiliated factories organized by Wuhan, 7 factories were loaned 554,449,830 yuan by the government, one factory was lent 21 million yuan by people from the community, and the rest were raised by military families, renting machines and tools from private merchants, and gradually relying on processing income to obtain development and expansion. This method of raising funds mainly by families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, supplemented by the help of the masses and the government, can further strengthen the sense of responsibility of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers for production, and enable the government to use limited funds to support more production organizations.
    (3) The leadership of production organizations should adopt the method of relying on families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers and implementing democratic management. The government only provides guidance on the principles and policies and provides assistance in raw material supply and product sales. The specific method can be to organize a production management committee by the production unit and mobilize families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers to organize and manage production. Since the establishment of the factory democratic management committee in Beijing, Wuhan and other cities, the families of martyrs and soldiers have felt that they can be their own masters, strengthened their production enthusiasm and work responsibility, and automatically put forward slogans such as not being late, not leaving early, improving technology, saving raw materials, and taking care of public property, overcoming the past thinking of "earning money to eat" and indifference to the factory; and supervising each other and inspecting each other, so that the factory can be consolidated and developed.
    3. Thoroughly solving the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' children in attending school and striving for full enrollment of their school-age children is also an important task in urban preferential treatment work. For the children of revolutionary martyrs who enter secondary schools or above, the priority of admission and the priority of enjoying people's scholarships should be earnestly implemented; for school-age children who have not yet entered primary school, the reasons should be checked, and if there are indeed financial difficulties, appropriate subsidies should be given according to the specific circumstances, or tuition fees should be reduced or exempted, or help should be provided to solve the problem of books, so that they can enter school as soon as possible. In the first semester of 1952, the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Bureau of Culture and Education in Changsha adopted methods such as subsidies or tuition reduction and exemption, which solved the problem of enrollment for 1,580 children, accounting for 70% of the children of martyrs and soldiers enrolled in that semester. However, the phenomenon of school dropout of martyrs' and soldiers' children still exists in some cities and needs to be further studied and resolved.
    In order to do the above tasks well, it is necessary to strengthen the political education of the broad masses of people and the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, further enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to their families, and promote the thinking of the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers to strive for greater glory; establish and improve the preferential treatment committee, so that it can truly become an organization under the leadership of the people's government to organize various groups, units, and social forces to cooperate with the government to do a good job in preferential treatment; pay attention to cultivating and rewarding models of preferential treatment work, and promote preferential treatment work through their backbone, leading, bridging and core role; strengthen leadership in a timely manner, conduct regular inspections, study and summarize experiences, especially the experience of introducing employment and organizing production. With all this done well, the urban preferential treatment work in 1953 will definitely make greater achievements.

    一九五二年的城市优抚工作和今后应注意的几个问题
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    在伟大的抗美援朝、爱国增产、“三反”、“五反”等运动的推动下，一九五二年的城市优抚工作获得了很大的成绩。一九五二年，由于爱国主义教育的进一步加强，群众更加热爱中国人民解放军与中国人民志愿军，更加尊敬烈军属和革命残废军人。各机关团体、工矿企业、学校、医院和各界人民都把作好优抚工作订入了爱国公约，实现了及时医疗烈军属的疾病、年节慰问、购物优待和解决其各种困难，提高了烈军属和革命残废军人的政治地位。各地贯彻了介绍职业与组织生产为主、实物补助为辅的方针，使绝大多数的烈军属和革命残废军人参加了生产和谋得了职业。如天津市烈军属、革命残废军人及转业军人，在一九五二年经政府介绍就业的共九千零九十四人，比一九五一年增加百分之八十以上，超过过去三年来介绍就业人数的总和；且其中半数为长期工，在较大的工厂中学习技术。对不能参加生产的孤老烈军属，各市人民政府拨付了抚恤粮，并采取了重点补助的办法，保证了他们的生活。烈士和军人的子女入学问题，也已大部得到解决。如杭州市一九五二年曾根据烈军属的经济情况，分别以公费助学金或减免费的办法，帮助烈士和军人的子女四百五十四人入了中学，一千零八十七个儿童入了小学。
    为了巩固既有的成绩，并把优抚工作更加提高一步，今后城市优抚工作应该着重研究并解决以下几个问题：
    一、重视并作好介绍烈军属、革命残废军人、转业军人就业的工作。一年来的经验证明，在一些工业较发达的大、中城市，为他们介绍长期固定的职业较组织他们单独进行生产所收效果为大。其好处是可以使他们有固定的工作岗位，能和军人一样地为人民服务，并在工作中受到锻炼与教育，也可使他们有较高和固定的收入，同时可以解决民政部门干部缺乏领导生产经验的困难。天津市在这一方面作得较好。首先他们明确了以介绍职业为主的方针，在领导机关的支持下，强调烈军属、革命残废军人就业的优先权，对不重视吸收烈军属、革命残废军人参加工作的单位，进行说服动员。而且每逢重大节日检查优抚工作时，都着重地检查就业优先权的执行情况。一九五一年由市组织的检查组检查了一百余处较大的工厂，一九五二年又检查了二百多处工厂。通过几次检查，已逐渐引起各工厂领导干部的重视。其次，是以负责到底的精神，打消工厂方面的疑虑，向那些惟恐烈军属、革命残废军人不好领导的单位进行解释，并在介绍前对烈军属、革命残废军人认真地进行动员和解释，对个别不服从厂方领导或强调自己要求的烈军属或革命残废军人，政府也积极地进行教育，减少厂方的困难。第三，是对烈军属、革命残废军人有就业条件的进行调查登记，建立了职业卡片，使领导机关掌握情况，得以分别条件介绍工作。第四，是和劳动就业部门密切配合，遇有就业机会，劳动介绍所就给烈军属、革命残废军人分配适当名额，通知民政局向各区分配布置。为了联系更加密切，天津市民政局还派干部驻在劳动介绍所办公，掌握此项工作。因此，全市一百一十个较大企业中，一般都贯彻了对烈军属、革命残废军人的优先录用方针，其中有三十九个单位还放宽了录用条件。公营电工北厂已吸收烈军属、革命残废军人、复员军人二百零二人参加工作，占全厂职工总人数的百分之三十。私营伟迪氏药厂也优先录用了七十二人，占全体职工的百分之三十一。这些工厂不仅厂方对入厂的烈军属、革命残废军人在生活住宿上能够给予照顾，而且职工也对他们加以帮助，使他们很快地掌握了技术，成为熟练的技术工人。武汉市采取了主动与劳动局联系、互相配合，并和各工厂、企业经常保持联系，在烈军属、革命残废军人代表会议上吸收各有关部门参加的办法，取得了各部门和各界人民的广泛支持，因而在一九五二年即介绍了一千七百四十八名烈军属参加工作。但有些城市的民政部门只埋怨“人家不录用没办法”，而不主动地争取有关部门与社会力量的支持，致介绍职业的成效不大。即在介绍就业工作较好的城市，仍有一些可以有机会参加工作的烈军属、革命残废军人还没有得到职业。
    从以上经验可以看出，介绍职业的关键，一方面是要使各机关、工厂企业的负责人认识到作好优抚工作的重要意义，欢迎烈军属和革命残废军人参加本单位工作，同时，必须取得劳动就业委员会的密切配合，使烈军属能切实享受就业的优先权；另一方面，还必须加强对烈军属、革命残废军人的思想教育，克服他们中某些人的功臣思想和轻视劳动的思想，培养他们的就业技能，造成他们就业的便利条件。北京市举办烈军属政治学习班以提高烈军属的政治觉悟和政策水平的办法，杭州市动员一百余名烈军属参加会计补习班学习技术的办法，值得加以研究推广。
    二、注意对烈军属生产的组织领导。由于各个城市经济发展的情况不同，在工业不多的城市还不可能完全依靠介绍职业解决烈军属的生活问题，而且由于有些烈军属本身条件的限制（如年龄太大、身体弱等），即在工业发达的城市也不能完全用介绍职业的办法解决全部问题，因此，组织烈军属生产仍是城市优抚工作中的一项重要工作。根据一年来的经验，组织烈军属生产时应该注意：
    （1）掌握使用资金少，容人多，粗工易学，原料供应充分，销路广阔且能得到发展的原则。如长沙市的制伞厂初期投资一亿五千万元，容纳烈军属学徒工人八十余人，年龄从十五岁到四十五岁不等，大部分都是妇女，学习六个月后，便能单独掌握一门技术。原料一般供给充分，销路很好，因而得到了巩固和发展。
    （2）生产资金以吸收烈军属的游资，动员他们集资或自带生产工具等办法解决较好，必要时再由政府或群众加以帮助。如武汉市组织的十四个军属工厂中，有七个厂是由政府贷款五亿五千四百四十九万八千三百元，一个工厂是由社会人士借给二千一百万元，其余都是由军属筹集基金，租用私商的机器工具，逐渐依靠加工收益获得发展扩大的。这种由烈军属、革命残废军人，集资为主、群众和政府帮助为辅的办法，可以更加加强烈军属和革命残废军人对生产的责任心，而且使政府能够以有限的资金扶植更多的生产组织。
    （3）生产组织的领导，应采取放手地依靠烈军属、革命残废军人，实行民主管理的办法，政府只在原则方针上加以指导，在原料供给、产品推销上给予扶助。具体作法可以由生产单位组织生产管理委员会，发动烈军属、革命残废军人组织起来管理生产。北京、武汉等城市自从成立了工厂民主管理委员会以后，烈军属感到自己能当家作主，加强了生产积极性和工作责任心，自动地提出不迟到、不早退、改进技术、节省原料、爱护公物等口号，克服了过去“挣钱吃饭”的思想和对工厂漠不关心的态度；并互相监督、互相检查，因而使工厂得到巩固和发展。
    三、彻底解决革命烈士和革命军人的子女入学困难，争取其学龄儿童全部入学，也是城市优抚工作的一项重要工作。对入中等以上学校的革命烈士子女，应认真执行录取优先权和享受人民助学金的优先权；对尚未入小学的学龄儿童，要检查原因，如确实生活困难，应根据具体情况给予适当补助，或给予减免学费的优待，或帮助解决书籍问题，使他们早日入学。长沙市在一九五二年上学期，民政局和文教局采取了补助或减免学费等办法，即解决了一千五百八十名儿童的入学问题，占该学期烈军属入学儿童的百分之七十。但目前有些城市烈士和军人子女的失学现象仍然存在，需要继续研究解决。
    为做好以上的几项工作，必须加强对广大人民和烈军属、革命残废军人的政治教育，进一步提高群众拥军优属的积极性，发扬烈军属、革命残废军人争取更大光荣的思想；建立与健全优抚委员会，使它真正成为在人民政府领导下组织各团体、各单位、各种社会力量协同政府作好优抚工作的组织；注意培养与奖励优抚工作模范，通过他们的骨干、带头、桥梁和核心作用推动优抚工作；及时加强领导，经常检查，研究总结经验，特别是介绍职业与组织生产的经验。这一切做好了，一九五三年的城市优抚工作定会做出更大的成绩。
