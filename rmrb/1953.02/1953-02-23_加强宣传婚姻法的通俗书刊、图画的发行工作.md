    Strengthen the Distribution of Popular Books and Pictures Promoting the Marriage Law

    Lin E'sheng wrote: The Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law Movement has decided that March will be the Movement Month for promoting and implementing the Marriage Law. If we pay attention to and fully utilize popular books and pictures for publicity during this movement month, it will achieve great results.

    Last year, Xinhua Bookstores in various parts of Fujian cooperated with the Marriage Law publicity campaign. The book "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law" alone sold more than 540,000 copies, which was warmly welcomed by the masses and played a great role in promoting and implementing the Marriage Law. Fang Zhenyu, a young woman from Fangshan Township, Second District, Putian, had her mother find her a partner who was much older than her. Although she was not satisfied, she did not dare to boldly object. After studying the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law" in winter school, she realized that marriage should be decided by herself and that parents should not arrange it. She firmly rejected the marriage and later fell in love freely with another young man. In Yangpu Township, First District, Fuqing County, a young couple, Zhang Gaowen and Zhang Baozhen, fell in love, but were unreasonably criticized by the masses. After reading the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law," they knew that free love and marriage were legal, so they mustered the courage to see the district head and obtained approval. The district head used this example to educate many people. I hope that Xinhua Bookstores in various places will strengthen the distribution of popular books and pictures promoting the Marriage Law, so that they can play a greater role in publicity.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强宣传婚姻法的通俗书刊、图画的发行工作
    林萼生来信：中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已决定三月为宣传贯彻婚姻法运动月，在这个运动月中如果重视和充分地运用通俗的书刊、图画进行宣传，将会收到很大效果。
    去年福建各地新华书店配合婚姻法宣传，光是
    “婚姻法图解通俗本”一书，即发行了五十四万多本，受到广大群众热烈欢迎，对宣传和贯彻婚姻法起了很大的推动作用。蒲田二区芳山乡青年女子方珍玉，她的母亲给她找了一个年龄比她大好多岁的对象，她虽然不满意，但不敢大胆地提出反对。在冬学中她学习了“婚姻法图解通俗本”以后，认识了婚姻应由自己作主，父母不能包办，她便坚决地拒绝了这项婚事，后来和另一个青年男子自由恋爱了。福清县一区洋浦乡一对青年男女张高温、张宝珍发生恋爱，受到群众无理指责，他们看了“婚姻法图解通俗本”，知道自由恋爱结婚是合法的，便鼓起勇气去见区长，得到批准。区长并拿这个事例教育了很多群众。我希望各地新华书店加强宣传婚姻法的通俗书刊、图画的发行工作，使它们发挥更大的宣传作用。
