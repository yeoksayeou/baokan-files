Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 31st: State-owned industrial enterprises, local state-owned industrial enterprises, and joint state-private industrial enterprises in Northwest China have formulated their production plans for this year. Due to the fact that some newly built enterprises have been put into production, and many enterprises that did not have plans in the past are now included in the national economic plan, a total of 164 units are incorporated into the comprehensive plan, which is 114 more than last year.

Northwest China's industrial production plan for this year is based on the needs of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards. The planned total output value will increase by 70.9% compared to last year. Product types include oil, coal, electricity, machinery, yarn, cloth, bricks, and tiles. The reason for the increase in total output value is that, in addition to some newly built enterprises being put into production, all enterprises are paying attention to leveraging the potential of existing equipment, actively improving equipment, improving labor organization, and promoting advanced experiences, thus greatly increasing various production quotas. For example, the cotton cloth production efficiency of joint state-private textile mills has increased by 34.22%. Production plans for the petroleum industry have also generally increased. For example, the gasoline production plan of Yumen Oil Mine has increased by 23% compared to last year, and kerosene has increased by 67%. The average industrial labor productivity of the entire region has increased by 59.16%. The quality of the plans compiled by various units this year has also greatly improved compared to previous years. In the past, most only compiled production plans, but this year many units have also compiled labor plans and cost plans. The planned cost of industrial production in the entire region has also decreased by 7.39% compared to last year's planned cost.

When compiling the production plan this year, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee organized ten planning work teams to go deep into the grassroots level with planning personnel from relevant units in various provinces and cities to assist in the compilation of the plan. More than 400 cadres from the industrial system alone participated in the compilation of the plan. In the beginning, some management and technical personnel in some units had conservative ideas, believing that "production is almost at its limit," and did not pay attention to leveraging the potential of the enterprise. After a widespread mobilization of the masses to discuss the plan and launch ideological struggles, these conservative ideas were eliminated. For example, when the Aganzhen Coal Mine in Gansu Province discussed this year's production plan, the coal miners proposed a labor quota of four tons, but the mine leaders thought it was too high and disagreed with this quota. Therefore, the working group launched a production competition among the workers in the plan compilation, improved labor organization, and as a result, reached six tons, and the highest reached nine tons. This fact gave the mine's management personnel a great education.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's production plan, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee specifically proposed the following measures when compiling the plan: First, implement economic accounting system through the production plan. Once the plan is approved, each enterprise must mobilize all employees to strive for the completion of the production plan. Second, establish and improve the planning work organizations of various enterprises, sort out original records, and strengthen statistical work. Third, strengthen technical organizational measures, promote advanced experience, and systematically promote the advanced methods of Yumen Oil Mine – implement monthly plans, deepen planning work into workshops and groups, and carry out production according to instructions and charts. Fourth, strengthen the inspection work in the implementation of the plan and implement a regular inspection system.

    西北区国营和公私合营工业订出生产计划
    今年计划生产总值比去年增加百分之七十点九
    【新华社西安三十一日电】西北区国营工业和地方国营工业、公私合营工业，已编出今年度的生产计划。由于一些新建企业已投入生产，许多过去没有编计划的企业现在都列入国民经济计划，所以汇入综合计划的共有一百六十四个单位，比去年多一百一十四个。
    西北区今年的工业生产计划是根据国家建设需要和人民生活水准提高的情况来编制的。计划生产总值比去年增加百分之七十点九。产品种类包括石油、煤炭、电力、机器、纱布、砖瓦等。生产总值增加的原因，除部分新建企业投入生产外，所有企业都注意发挥现有设备的潜在力，积极改善设备，改进劳动组织，推广先进经验，所以大大提高了各种生产定额。如公私合营纺织厂棉布生产效率提高百分之三十四点二二。石油工业生产计划也普遍提高。如玉门油矿汽油生产计划比去年提高百分之二十三，煤油提高百分之六十七。全区工业劳动生产率平均提高百分之五十九点一六。今年各单位编制的计划，质量比往年也有很大提高，往年多半只编生产计划，今年很多单位同时编了劳动计划和成本计划，全区工业生产的计划成本也比去年的计划成本降低百分之七点三九。
    在今年编制生产计划时，西北财政经济委员会曾组织十个计划工作队会同各省市有关单位计划人员深入基层协助编制计划，只工业系统参加编制计划的干部就有四百多人。开始有些单位的管理人员、技术人员存在保守思想，认为“生产已差不多了”，不重视发挥企业的潜在力。经过普遍发动群众讨论计划，展开思想斗争，这些保守思想才打消了。如甘肃省阿干镇煤矿讨论今年生产计划时，掘煤工人提出劳动定额为四吨，该矿领导方面认为太高，不同意这个定额。于是工作组在编制计划中发动工人开展生产竞赛，改善劳动组织，结果，达到了六吨，最高的达到九吨，这个事实给该矿的管理人员以很大的教育。
    为保证完成今年的生产计划，西北财政经济委员会在汇编计划时特提出下列措施：一，通过生产计划贯彻经济核算制，在计划一经批准后，各企业就要动员全体职工为完成生产计划而奋斗。二，设立和健全各企业的计划工作组织机构，整理原始纪录，加强统计工作。三，加强技术组织措施，推广先进经验，有计划地推广玉门油矿的先进方法——实行月度计划、把计划工作深入车间和小组、按指示图表进行生产等。四，加强计划执行中的检查工作，实行定期的检查制度。
