    Do Not Mix Dangerous Goods into Postal Packages
    Wu Shaohan writes: On October 3rd of last year, an accident occurred at Bengbu Station where a postal package spontaneously combusted mid-transit. After investigation, it was found that one package was filled entirely with dangerous chemical substances. According to regulations, dangerous goods must not be sent as general packages; they should have specific packaging standards, and the outer packaging should be marked with labels such as "Do Not Invert" and "Keep Away From Sunlight." When necessary, they should also be isolated from other goods. In order to prevent such accidents from happening, postal and railway workers should be vigilant and carefully inspect packages when accepting them; people mailing packages should be more aware and should not violate regulations by mixing dangerous goods into packages.

    不要把危险品混入邮包投寄
    吴绍汉来信：去年十月三日蚌埠车站发生了一件邮政包裹中途自燃的事故。事后检查发现有一件邮包装的全是危险性化学药品。按规定，危险品不得当一般包裹投寄，应有一定的包装规格，并在包裹外皮上注明“不得颠倒”、“禁忌日光”等标志，必要时还要和其他货物隔离。为了杜绝这类事故的发生，邮政和铁路工作人员在收受包裹时要提高警惕，认真检查；邮寄包裹的人应该提高自觉性，不要违反规定把危险品混入包裹投寄。
