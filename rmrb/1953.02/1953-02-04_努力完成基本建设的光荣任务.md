Strive to Fulfill the Glorious Task of Basic Construction
Li Yiqing, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central-South Administrative Council

Over the past three years, the Central-South region has basically completed its economic recovery. The annual output of major industrial products in 1952 exceeded the highest production levels before the Anti-Japanese War. Taking the highest pre-war annual output as 100, the annual output of tungsten in 1952 was 183, tin was 100, cement was 314, electricity was 150, coal was 109, and cotton yarn was 116; pig iron was 111 compared to the 1936 output. The region's agricultural production also exceeded pre-Anti-Japanese War levels. The proportion of industry and agriculture in the region is also gradually changing, with the total value of industrial production in 1952 reaching 16.93 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. These facts demonstrate that the economic recovery work in the Central-South region over the past three years has provided favorable conditions for large-scale economic construction.

In the next few years, the state will build or renovate a number of large-scale factories and mines in the Central-South region. These include large-scale iron and steel factories, machinery factories, and so on. The abundant tungsten, lead-zinc, and other mineral resources in the Central-South region will be mined, beneficiated, and smelted using the latest technology; large-scale prospecting and drilling of coal mines will be carried out throughout the region, and mine design and construction will be carried out simultaneously. With the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, light industry, which meets the material needs of the people, will also develop greatly. New types of cotton textile mills will continue to be established; other industries such as papermaking, aquatic products, and fruit processing will also be appropriately developed. After these factories and mines are completed, they will bring great changes to the economic landscape and people's lives in the region.

In the country’s large-scale economic construction, the task of industrial construction in the Central-South region is glorious, but also very arduous. This is because: first, the number of state-owned industrial workers, including technical personnel and key leading cadres, in the Central-South region is still small, and the strength of basic construction is still weak; second, our leadership in basic construction over the past three years has been very inadequate. We not only have little experience in basic construction, but also lack sound institutions. Although the production plans of many factories and mines have mostly been completed or overfulfilled in the past, basic construction plans have not been completed year after year. In 1950, only 61 percent of the annual basic construction plan was completed, in 1951 only 76 percent was completed, and in 1952 only 80 percent was completed; the percentage of basic construction plans completed by local state-owned industries was even lower; third, the strength of our design and construction teams in basic construction is far from meeting the tasks and requirements of basic construction. Most industrial systems have not established specialized design institutions, and the strength of design cadres has not been organized; the design work is still insufficient in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and many of the factories and mines we have designed in the past were designed on the basis of backward technology and backward quotas. The organization of construction forces is even worse. Many factories and mines have the idea of relying on and waiting. There are only 20,000 fixed construction and installation workers in the entire region. Democratic reforms have not yet been carried out among construction workers, and advanced technologies and experiences have not been systematically promoted.

In order to complete the huge and arduous construction tasks in the future, we must focus on basic construction in our economic work and, first of all, organize the forces of basic construction. Therefore, all cadres must unify their thinking and understanding, so that all their work must fully adapt to the needs of national economic construction. We must not only agree in principle to focus on the construction of heavy industry and defense industry, but also obey the needs of the state in specific actions such as unified allocation of manpower and financial resources. Those who refuse to transfer good cadres on the pretext of being busy and having many tasks, or who postpone important work tasks, are violating national interests. Local industries should resolutely not be established if they are not essential, in accordance with the principles instructed by the Central Government, in order to concentrate manpower and financial resources on industrial construction that is decisive for the national economy. At the same time, in order to adapt to national economic construction, all work must be planned. With a scientific work plan, we can reasonably exert organizational strength; with a scientific work plan, work guidance can be more practical. In order to meet the needs of national economic construction, leading cadres must personally go deep into factories and mines, deep into the masses of workers, and quickly and practically solve the key problems in the current practical work.

In order to ensure the completion of the industrial construction plan, we believe that the Central-South region must grasp the following key issues in 1953:

First, geological work is the pioneer of heavy industry. The drilling work task in the Central-South region in 1953 will be twenty times greater than the task in 1952. In order to complete this task, a large number of drilling workers must be trained. In 1953, the Central-South Geological Bureau plans to train 2,800 drilling workers and 400 prospecting team members; the coal mine and non-ferrous metal industries will also train a large number of drilling and surveying personnel; and the Wuhan Geological Secondary Technical School (which has now enrolled 1,700 students) will be well managed. In drilling work, the rapid drilling and mud drilling methods should be promoted to improve drilling efficiency and reduce drilling costs.

Second, the total amount of construction and installation engineering in 1953 has greatly increased. The total construction area for the year exceeds the construction task in 1952 by more than double, requiring approximately 90,000 construction workers. In addition to the fixed number of workers this year, the contract system should be adopted to make some workers seasonal semi-fixed workers, and a number of temporary workers should be recruited. We must also use the greatest strength to do a good job in recruiting and training workers. First of all, the various types of workers needed by each department should be uniformly allocated through the labor department, and unorganized behavior such as freely recruiting workers or competing for workers is strictly prohibited. Secondly, fixed workers should be allocated and trained in batches, using the rainy season or gaps in time to concentrate them or carry out democratic reforms on the construction site to improve workers' awareness and purify the worker ranks. Thirdly, in construction and installation work, advanced working methods and advanced working experience should be vigorously promoted to improve production efficiency. In addition, the ratio of technical personnel to workers in construction is calculated at 3 to 100. There is a great shortage of construction technicians in the region. It is planned to request the Central Government to allocate a portion of the graduates from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools this year, and the remainder will be trained by opening training courses and recruiting young students.

Third, a large portion of the industrial investment in the Central-South region in 1953 is for the exploration and design expenses of new factories. The quality of the exploration and design work of new factories will determine the speed of the entire industrial construction in the Central-South region. Therefore, a large number of cadres and technicians should be quickly transferred to form preparatory institutions for each factory; forces should be organized in a unified manner to conduct a comprehensive site survey in the designated area, and meteorological, hydrological data and industrial transportation conditions should be systematically collected; a large number of technicians should be drawn from the returning technical personnel and local industry, concentrated by system, to carry out factory design and product design; each construction engineering company should establish an engineering geological team to carry out surveying and drilling work on the factory site; in addition, special attention should be paid to training soil analysis and testing personnel.

Fourth, the investment in training cadres and technicians has greatly increased in the 1953 investment, with 20 percent of the education funds in the iron and steel industry, machinery industry, and non-ferrous metal industry investment. The Central-South Financial and Economic Committee has formulated an adjustment plan for secondary technical schools with the Central-South Education Department, which will quickly and effectively solve the problem of teachers and classrooms. The number of technical workers in the region is far from meeting the needs of the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, we must vigorously do a good job in the training of technicians and workers, and systematically and on a large scale carry out on-the-job spare time technical education for employees, open technical schools and technical training classes, widely sign apprenticeship contracts, adopt the method of "apprentices upgrading, masters rewarded", and carry out the master-apprentice teaching movement. At the same time, we are also preparing to revise the wage evaluation standards in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government, so that young workers can quickly improve their skills.

The task of basic construction in the Central-South region in 1953 is arduous. The decisive key at present is the allocation and organization of cadres and technical personnel. According to the above tasks, 1,520 cadres above the county level will be transferred from the countryside to the industrial construction department throughout the year, and technical personnel will be transferred from existing factories and various systems to the design, construction, and preparatory institutions of new factories and mines.

In order to ensure the completion of the arduous task in 1953, we must also seize the time and arrange the work for the whole year in a planned and step-by-step manner. In the first quarter, we should first do a good job in preparing for basic construction. Each industrial management department or basic construction unit should quickly concentrate design personnel in the first quarter, immediately start work, form engineering companies, and at the same time cooperate with the trade union and labor department to carry out democratic reforms among construction workers and start training workers; complete the adjustment of secondary technical schools; inspect the design and construction work of basic construction, solve problems in a timely manner, summarize experience, and improve work efficiency and quality. The focus of work in the second quarter is, on the one hand, to establish and improve the preparatory institutions according to the established plan, organize forces, and carry out site survey work; on the other hand, to seize the design work and strive to complete the design work tasks on time. For construction projects with existing designs or standard designs, construction should begin during the gaps in time. In the third quarter, each construction engineering company should vigorously promote advanced working methods and advanced working experience, strive to have all major projects start construction in an all-round way, the material department should do a good job in material supply to avoid work stoppage due to lack of materials, and at the same time prepare to submit equipment to be ordered in the 1954 fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, we should strengthen the inspection of basic construction work, pay attention to equipment ordering and installation work, ensure the completion of the annual basic construction plan, and start designing the basic construction projects for the 1954 fiscal year.

Basic construction in industrial construction has been raised to a primary position, but the leadership of the production of existing factories cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Each factory and mine must complete the production reform work in the third quarter, and strive to overfulfill the annual production plan this year. Each factory and mine should promote advanced working methods, give full play to the potential of enterprises, and improve the business level of operation and management, so as to accumulate experience, train cadres and technical workers from existing factories. Therefore, it is still necessary to transfer a group of cadres to strengthen the production leadership of enterprises. Only in this way can we rely on the old factories to build new factories and smoothly complete the construction tasks assigned to us by the state.

The historical task has been placed on our shoulders. We believe that as long as we are willing to learn humbly, study hard, and exert a high degree of enthusiasm for building the motherland, we will definitely be able to complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the state.

    努力完成基本建设的光荣任务
    中南行政委员会财政经济委员会副主任  李一清
    过去三年来，中南区已经基本上完成了经济的恢复工作。一九五二年主要工业品的年产量都超过抗日战争以前的最高生产水平。如以战前最高年产量为一○○，则一九五二年钨的年产量为一八三，锡为一○○，水泥为三一四，电为一五○，煤为一○九，棉纱为一一六；生铁与一九三六年产量比较，为一一一。全区农业生产也超过抗日战争以前生产水平。全区工农业生产的比重也在逐渐改变，一九五二年工业生产量总值已达工农业生产总值的百分之十六点九三。这些事实说明了中南区三年来的经济恢复工作，已给大规模经济建设提供了有利条件。
    今后几年中，国家将在中南地区兴建或改建一些规模巨大的厂矿。其中包括规模巨大的钢铁工厂、机械工厂等等。中南区蕴藏丰富的钨矿、铅锌矿等将以最新式的技术进行采矿选矿与冶炼；有重点的大规模的勘察钻探煤矿的工作也将在全区范围内进行，并将同时进行矿井的设计与施工。随着经济的发展、人民生活水平的提高，为满足人民物质生活需要的轻工业也将随之有很大发展。新型的棉纺织厂将继续建立；其他如造纸工业、水产、水果加工工业亦将有适当的发展。这些厂矿建成以后，将使全区的经济面貌和人民生活发生极大的变化。
    在国家大规模经济建设中，中南区工业建设的任务是十分光荣的，但也是十分艰巨的。这是因为：第一，目前中南区国营工业的职工，包括技术人员和主要领导干部都还不多，基本建设的力量还薄弱；第二，三年来我们对基本建设的领导是很不够的。在基本建设方面不仅经验不多，而且机构也不健全。虽然过去很多厂矿的生产计划大都已完成或超额完成了，但基本建设计划却年年不能完成。一九五○年只完成了全年基本建设计划的百分之六十一，一九五一年只完成百分之七十六，一九五二年只完成百分之八十；地方国营工业完成基本建设计划的百分数则更低；第三，我们基本建设中的设计与施工力量和基本建设的任务及要求相差是很远的。各个工业系统大多未建立专门的设计机构，设计干部的力量尚未组织起来；设计工作在学习苏联先进经验方面还很不够，我们以往所设计的厂矿很多都是在落后技术基础上根据落后的定额进行设计的。施工力量组织得更加不好，很多厂矿存在依赖和等待思想，全区固定建筑、安装工人仅有二万人，还没有在建筑工人中进行民主改革，先进技术与先进经验也没有系统地推广。
    为了完成今后巨大的繁重的建设任务，必须把经济工作的重点放在基本建设方面，并且首先把基本建设力量组织起来。因此，所有干部必须统一思想认识，使自己的一切工作一定要完全适应国家经济建设的需要。我们不仅要在原则上同意有重点地进行重工业与国防工业建设，而且要在统一调度人力、财力等具体行动上服从国家的需要。那些借口工作忙、任务多而不愿抽调好干部，或将一些重要的工作任务向后推迟的做法都是违反国家利益的。地方工业应该按照中央指示的原则，凡可办可不办者坚决不办，以便集中人力、财力进行对国民经济有决定意义的工业建设。同时，为了适应国家经济建设，一切工作都必须计划化。有了科学的工作计划，才能合理地发挥组织力量；有了科学的工作计划，工作指导才能更切合实际。为了适应国家经济建设的需要，领导干部必须亲自深入厂矿，深入工人群众中，迅速地实际地解决当前实际工作的关键问题。
    为了保证工业建设计划的完成，我们认为中南区在一九五三年内必须抓住以下几个关键性的问题：
    第一，地质工作是重工业的开路先锋，中南区一九五三年的钻探工作任务将比一九五二年的任务增加二十倍。为了完成这一任务，必须大量培养钻探工人。一九五三年中南地质局计划训练钻探工人二千八百人，训练探矿队队员四百人；煤矿与有色金属工业方面也将大批地培养钻探、测量人员；办好武汉地质中等技术学校（该校现已招收学生一千七百人）。在钻探工作中，要推行快速钻进与泥浆钻探法，提高钻探效率，降低钻探成本。
    第二，一九五三年建筑、安装工程总量已大大增加，全年总建筑面积超过一九五二年建筑任务一倍以上，约需建筑工人九万人。除了今年固定的一部分工人以外，还应采取合同制的方式，使一部分工人成为季节性的半固定工人，并招收一部分临时工。我们还必须运用最大的力量，作好招收、训练工人的工作。首先，各部门需要的各种工人，应经过劳动部门统一调配，严禁自由招收工人或争夺工人的无组织行为。其次，固定工人要分期调配、分期训练，利用雨季或空隙时间集中起来或在工地进行民主改革，以提高工人觉悟，纯洁工人队伍。再次，在建筑、安装工作中，要大力推行先进工作方法与先进工作经验，以提高生产效率。此外，施工的技术人员和工人的比例以三比一百计算，全区施工技术人员还十分不足，拟在今年大学、专科学校毕业学生及中等技术学校毕业学生中，呈请中央调配一部分，其余将开办训练班招收青年学生进行训练。
    第三，一九五三年中南区的工业投资中，有很大一部分是新厂的勘察设计经费。新厂勘察设计工作的好坏，将决定中南区整个工业建设的速度。因此，要迅速抽调大批干部与技术人员组成各厂的筹备机构；统一组织力量，在预定地区进行全面的厂址勘察工作，并系统地搜集气象、水文资料及工业交通情况；从归队技术人员中和地方工业方面抽调大批技术人员，按系统集中，进行工厂设计与产品设计；各建筑工程公司应建立工程地质队，进行厂址的测绘与钻探工作；另外要特别注意培养土工分析化验人员。
    第四，在一九五三年投资中，培养干部和技工的经费已大大增加，在钢铁业、机械工业、有色金属工业投资中都有百分之二十的教育经费。中南财政经济委员会已与中南教育部拟定中等技术学校调整方案，将迅速有效地解决教师及教室问题。全区技术工人距五年建设的需要很远，因此要大力做好技工的培养与训练工作，并有系统地大规模地开展职工业余技术教育，开办技工学校和技工训练班，广泛订立师徒合同，采用“徒弟升级，师父得奖”的办法，开展师徒教学运动。同时，并准备依照中央规定，修改工资评定标准，以便使青年工人迅速提高技术。
    中南区一九五三年基本建设的任务是繁重的，当前决定性的关键，是干部与技术人员的调配与组织问题。根据以上各项任务，全年将从农村中抽调一千五百二十名县级以上的干部转入工业建设部门，并将从现有工厂和各个系统调集技术人员进入设计、施工和新建各厂矿的筹备机构。
    为了保证完成一九五三年的繁重任务，我们还必须抓紧时间，有计划、有步骤地安排全年工作。第一季度中首先应作好基本建设的准备工作。各工业管理部门或基本建设单位在第一季中应迅速将设计人员集中起来，立即开始工作，组成工程公司，同时应配合工会与劳动部门，在建筑工人中进行民主改革，并着手训练工人；完成中等技术学校的调整工作；检查基本建设的设计和施工工作，及时解决问题，总结经验，提高工作效率和质量。第二季工作重点，一方面根据已经确定的计划，建立并健全筹备机构，组织力量，进行厂址勘测工作；另一方面，应抓紧设计工作，争取按时完成设计工作任务。已经有设计或标准设计的建筑工程，应利用空隙开始施工。第三季各建筑工程公司应大力推广先进工作方法与先进工作经验，争取各主要工程全面动工，材料部门应作好材料供应工作，以免停工待料，同时准备提出要在一九五四年度订购的设备。第四季应加强对基本建设工作的检查，注意设备订购与安装工作，保证完成全年基本建设计划；着手设计一九五四年度的基本建设工程。
    工业建设中的基本建设已提到首要地位，但对现有工厂生产的领导也不能有丝毫的放松。各厂矿必须在第三季内完成生产改革工作，争取今年超额完成全年的生产计划。各厂矿都应推行先进工作方法，发挥企业的潜在能力，提高经营管理的业务水平，以便从现有工厂中积累经验，培养干部和技术工人。因此，抽调一批干部加强企业的生产领导仍是必要的，只有这样我们才能依靠老厂建设新厂，顺利地完成国家给予我们的建设任务。
    历史的任务已经放在我们的肩上。我们相信，只要我们肯虚心学习，努力钻研，发挥高度的建设祖国的工作热情，我们一定能够完成国家交给我们的光荣任务。
