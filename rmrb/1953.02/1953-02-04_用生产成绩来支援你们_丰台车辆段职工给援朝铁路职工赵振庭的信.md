    "Support You with Production Achievements"
    -- Letter from Workers of Fengtai Vehicle Depot to Zhao Zhenting, Railway Worker Aiding Korea
    Comrade Zhao Zhenting:
    We received your letter during the New Year holiday. It was being read aloud at the depot's labor model and meritorious worker symposium that day, and everyone was unspeakably happy to hear it. Your glorious achievements in overcoming various difficulties during the war in Korea and repairing 1,300 broken cars inspired all the comrades in the depot. We have published your work achievements in our depot's newsletter so that everyone can learn from you.
    Now let us tell you about the situation in our depot. In 1952, our depot completed or overfulfilled its production tasks every month. As you know, in 1951, our depot repaired eighty annual overhaul cars a month, which was quite tight, and we often had to work overtime. But 1952 was different. The task for January was one hundred annual overhaul cars, but we overfulfilled it by two cars. The number increased month by month, rising to one hundred and seventy-five from July, and we still completed and exceeded the task every month. In addition to this, in 1952 our depot also added fifteen freight car medium repairs per month. Medium-repaired cars are of much higher quality than annual overhaul cars; very broken cars must be repaired into new cars, and the quality must be guaranteed for four years of use. But we also overfulfilled this task. By November, we had completed one hundred and seventy-six medium-repaired cars. In May, we launched a movement to find tricks and tap potential. By the end of December, we had found 504 tricks and rationalization proposals in our work, 416 of which were approved, and 318 are now being implemented, greatly improving production efficiency. Just a part of the tricks being implemented has increased the country's wealth by more than 100 million yuan a year. Many people forgot to eat and rest in the process of finding tricks, and they were still studying at home late at night.
    In December, the entire depot accepted the glorious task of repairing one hundred and twenty-five vehicles to strengthen national defense. These cars were very badly damaged, and some were more difficult to repair than building new cars. Our depot lacked equipment, manpower, and materials, and we were also experiencing the cold winter, so there were many difficulties. Just at this time (December 9), everyone listened to the report from the representatives of the Second Delegation to Korea to comfort the troops, introducing your heroic struggle in Korea. That day, everyone clapped their hands red and shed tears with excitement. The more we listened, the more excited we became, listening from 5:30 in the afternoon until after 10:00 at night, without anyone complaining of hunger or feeling that the time was long. The day after listening to the report, each group began to discuss, and the workers said: In a peaceful environment, compared to the workers aiding Korea and the volunteers, we have no difficulties. We must use the spirit of the volunteers in combat to revive broken cars.
    After the work of reviving the broken cars began, everyone in the entire depot participated in the battle. The groups in each production department all tried to finish their work early so that they could come out and repair the damaged cars. Employees from the technical department, labor and wages, finance, inspection and adjustment, general affairs, and personnel departments also participated in the car repair work. The depot director, the chairman of the trade union, and the leading comrades of the Party and Youth League at all levels picked up tools and got on the cars. Three female workers from the cotton waste room also came to the site. They didn't know car repair technology, but they carried paint buckets, climbed on the roofs of cars, and crawled under the cars to do oiling work. They got their faces covered with paint, and some forgot to feed their children. The car repair workers, whether they were carpenters, riveters, welders, or ironworkers, all displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. During lunch breaks, some people secretly went to work on their own. The weather was cold, and the acetylene hoses of the welding team were always frozen and airtight, so they came up with ways to boil them in water and roast them with fire. The workers of the entire depot persisted in working in the wind and snow. At 4:00 pm on December 31, one hundred and twenty-five severely damaged cars were all turned into new cars and driven to the national defense transportation front.
    In 1952, employee benefits were greatly improved. In Fengtai District, more than 1,000 workers' dormitories were built in one year. Our depot was allocated 150 rooms. One hundred and thirty-four workers have now moved into the new dormitories. Red brick houses, facing the sun, with glass doors and windows, cement floors, and snow-white ceilings and walls. It's so beautiful.
    In our depot, the phenomenon of overtime work was completely eliminated in 1952. A club has been established in the depot, and more than 1,000 new books and magazines have been purchased. There are also Parcheesi, playing cards, and small billiards tables. People who go to play in their spare time every day are always crowded. In addition, a military band, a workers' family waist drum team, and basketball and volleyball teams have been organized. A few days ago, our depot also held a winter sports meeting. Most of the employees participated in the competition, and many family members also participated. Many glorious families also came to participate. Like your wife, Han Defen, and Comrade Li Jinming's wife, Liu Xiuyin, both participated in running and rope skipping races. Employees and their families all have a belief: to improve their health, do a good job in production, do a good job in housework, and support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Starting in July 1952, our depot began a crash course to eliminate illiteracy. Leaving production work to go to school, in more than seventy days, people who did not know a single word could learn more than two thousand words, read newspapers and books, write short articles, and take notes.
    Now everyone in the entire depot has a belief: the peaceful construction of the motherland and the continuous improvement of the people's lives are inseparable from your arduous struggle on the front lines in Korea, braving the enemy's artillery fire. We will definitely make greater efforts to make our New China's first five-year economic construction great. In 1953, we will strive to overfulfill the annual production task and support the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and achieve greater victories.
    Wang Lin, Secretary of the Party General Branch of Beijing Railway Administration Fengtai Vehicle Depot, Zhang Jie, Depot Director, Liu Qi, Chairman of the Trade Union, Chen Yaoting, Secretary of the Youth League General Branch, and all employees.

### “用生产成绩来支援你们”——丰台车辆段职工给援朝铁路职工赵振庭的信

    “用生产成绩来支援你们”
    ——丰台车辆段职工给援朝铁路职工赵振庭的信赵振庭同志：
    在新年假期中，我们接到了你的来信。那天正开全段劳动模范、功臣座谈会，会上朗读了你的信，大家听了都有说不出的高兴。你们在朝鲜克服战争中的各种困难，修复一千三百辆破车的光辉成绩，鼓舞了全段的同志们。我们已把你的工作事迹刊在本段小报上，以便大家都跟你学习。
    现在我们告诉你咱段的一些情况吧。在一九五二年中，咱段每月都完成或超额完成了生产任务。你也知道，一九五一年时咱段一月干八十辆年修车，每月弄的挺紧，还要经常加班加点。一九五二年可不是这样了。一月份的任务是一百辆年修车，但还超额二辆完成了。以后逐月增加，七月份起增高到一百七十五辆，仍每月完成并超过任务。除此以外，在一九五二年咱段还增加做货车中修每月十五辆。中修车比年修车质量高得多，要把很破的车修成新车，质量要保证使用四年。但咱们也超额完成了这项任务。到十一月就完成了中修车一百七十六辆。在五月份，咱们开展了找窍门、挖潜力运动。到十二月底，就在工作中找到了窍门与合理化建议五百零四件，被批准的有四百十六件，现在实行的有三百一十八件，大大提高了生产效率。仅仅实行中的一部分窍门，就为国家一年增加财富一亿多元。好多人在找窍门工作中，忘了吃饭，忘了休息，深夜也在家钻研。
    十二月份，全段接受了修复一百二十五辆加强国防的车辆的光荣任务。这些车破的很厉害，有的修好比造新车还难。咱段设备、人力、材料都不够，又遇上天寒地冻的冬天，所以困难很多。恰在这时（十二月九日），大伙听了第二届赴朝慰问团代表介绍你们在朝鲜英勇斗争情形的报告。那天，大伙把手掌拍红了，兴奋地流了泪。真是越听越起劲，由下午五点半一直听到夜里十点多，没一个人嚷饿，没一个人感觉时间长。听了报告的第二天，各组展开讨论，工友们说：咱们在和平的环境里，跟援朝职工比，跟志愿军比，咱没有任何困难。咱要用志愿军作战的精神来复活破车。
    复活破车工作开始后，全段每一个人都参加了战斗。各生产部门的小组，都想办法把自己的工作提前做完，出来修破损车。技术室、劳资、财务、检调、总务、人事部门的职工，也参加了修车工作。段长、工会主席和党团的各级领导同志，都拿起工具上了车。棉丝房女工友也有三个人到了现场，她们不会修车技术，却提着油漆桶爬在车顶、钻在车下，做涂油工作。她们弄得满脸是油漆，有的只顾工作，把给小孩喂奶的事都忘了。修车的工友们，无论是木工、铆工、电焊、铁工，都发挥了高度的爱国热情。中午吃完饭休息时，有的人自己偷偷去干活。天气冷，熔接组的电石带总冻得不透气，他们想出办法，用水煮、火烤。全段工友在风雪中坚持工作，在十二月三十一日午后四点，一百二十五辆大破损车，都变成了新车，驶向国防运输战线上了。
    在一九五二年，职工福利大大提高了。一年中，丰台地区就建筑了工人宿舍一千多间。本段分配到一百五十间。现已有一百三十四位工友迁入了新宿舍。红砖房，面朝阳，玻璃门窗，洋灰地，雪白的顶棚，雪白的墙。真是太漂亮了。
    在咱段上，一九五二年内彻底消灭了加班加点现象。段内建立了俱乐部，新书杂志就购买了一千多本。还有康乐棋、扑克牌、小台球，每天业余去玩的人，总是挤得满满的。另外还组织了军乐队，职工家属腰鼓队，篮、排球队。前些天咱段还举行了冬季运动会。大部分职工参加了竞赛，职工家属参加的也很多。好多光荣家属也来参加了。像你的爱人韩德芬，李金明同志的爱人刘秀银，都参加了赛跑和跳绳竞走。职工和家属都有一个信念：把身体锻炼好，搞好生产，搞好家务，支持抗美援朝斗争。
    一九五二年七月起，咱段开始了速成扫除文盲工作。脱离生产工作去上学，在七十多天中，一字不识的人能学会两千多字，会看书报，会写短文，会记笔记。
    现在全段每个人都有一个信念：祖国的和平建设，人民生活的不断提高，都是和你们在朝鲜前线冒着敌人炮火艰苦斗争分不开的。我们一定以更大的努力，把咱新中国第一个五年经济大建设，搞的棒棒的。一九五三年，争取超额完成全年生产任务，支援抗美援朝战争，取得更大的胜利。
    北京铁路管理局丰台车辆段党总支书记王琳、段长张杰、工会主席刘启、青年团总支书记陈耀庭及全体职工
        一月十日
