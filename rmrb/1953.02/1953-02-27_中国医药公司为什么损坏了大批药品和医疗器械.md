    The leading cadres of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation were irresponsible and engaged in blind operations, resulting in the stockpiling and damage of a large number of valuable drugs and medical equipment, causing huge losses to the country. According to preliminary statistics, the current value of various drugs and medical equipment stockpiled and damaged by the company is approximately 21.5 billion yuan. The interest paid and the losses due to spoilage of a large number of drugs and medical equipment that have been stockpiled for a long time amount to 6.3588 billion yuan.

    A large number of valuable drugs have lost their effectiveness or deteriorated

    In the warehouses of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, there are 48,720 vials of penicillin, worth 390 million yuan, piled up. However, these penicillin have completely lost their effectiveness. Penicillin is a good medicine for treating pneumonia. Generally, a child with severe pneumonia can be cured with only six vials of penicillin. This means that if these penicillin had not expired, they could have cured 8,120 children suffering from severe pneumonia. The company has deer antler essence worth 85.58 million yuan that has deteriorated. The seals of "Xiaofa Mieding" powder, worth more than 468 million yuan, have become moldy, and some of the powder has discolored. Some of these drugs were allocated by the China Import Company, some were transferred from the former China Industrial Equipment Company, and some were delivered by the Southwest District Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation. It is said that they were already bad when they arrived. However, after the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation accepted this batch of bad drugs, it neither investigated the reasons and responsibilities, nor requested instructions from higher authorities on how to resolve the issue, nor quickly disposed of them, but simply piled them up in the warehouse. Not only did these drugs get worse and worse, but a large amount of storage costs had to be paid.

    Forty X-ray machines were "leaking oil" at the port

    In October of last year, the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation purchased forty X-ray machines from abroad. This batch of X-ray machines was stockpiled in Qinhuangdao for more than a month and then transferred to Tianjin Port. The company did not promptly inspect them and they were stockpiled at Tianjin Port for more than twenty days. This batch of X-ray machines was exposed to the sun and wind, and oil was leaking directly from the boxes. Later, they had to buy more X-ray machine oil to add to them before they were allocated. The company's equipment warehouse on Garden Road in Tianjin is very humid, but many devices are placed in the basement. As a result, one hundred and five X-ray machine clips rusted and became waste, seventy-two boxes of X-ray paper lost their effectiveness due to moisture, and thirty-nine sets of colorimeters and thirty-eight lancet knives rusted. The loss of these four items alone amounted to more than 100 million yuan. In August 1951, the company imported a batch of "chloroform" (an anesthetic). Because it was a dangerous product and could not be stored in the city, it was placed in the open air in the suburbs. This drug is very volatile, and by April 1952, most of the 3,880 bottles of "chloroform" were empty, with only a few having half a bottle left.

    Ergot Paste and "Adipin"

    The company ordered ergot raw materials from abroad for hemostasis in obstetrics and gynecology, but because it did not specify the specifications, it bought 1,000 bottles of ergot extract (700 cubic centimeters per bottle), worth 5 billion yuan. If the ergot extract were made into injections, each bottle could make 147,000 injections, but at present, there is no pharmaceutical factory in our country that can manufacture such a large number of injections. If it is made into an oral medicine, the sales volume is also not large, because the medical departments now use agents such as Bibei Agar and ferric chloride, which have a wide range of uses, unlike ergot extract which can only be used for gynecological hemostasis. This resulted in the stockpiling of 5 billion yuan of funds for eighteen months, with interest and expenses alone amounting to 2.97 billion yuan. In 1952, the company imported 5,000 kilograms of "Adipin." What was originally wanted was 5,000 tablets with a content of 100%, but because the unit of measurement was not specified, 5,000 kilograms with a content of one-third were purchased. These tablets are of different sizes and have many fragments, requiring processing before being sold. However, existing pharmaceutical factories in our country cannot process them in large quantities, resulting in the stockpiling of "Adipin" worth more than 4.25 billion yuan for nearly a year. In March 1952, the company imported 69,240 sheets of asbestos filter plates, worth 1.3848 billion yuan. It is said that this was ordered by the Central Ministry of Health through the Foreign Trade Bureau of the former Central Ministry of Trade. Asbestos filter plates must be used on special funnels, but no funnels were purchased when ordering, so this batch of filter plates had to be piled up in the warehouse.

    No "Damage Processing," No "Claims"

    "Damage processing" means repairing and selling goods that have minor damage. However, the company's staff were irresponsible, and everyone shirked their responsibility, and no one did this. As a result, some damaged goods had to be stockpiled. "Claims" means that if goods purchased from abroad are found to be damaged within a certain period after import, compensation can be requested from the other party. However, the company did not do this, which also caused serious stockpiling and losses. The largest losses included: twelve sets of ultra-shortwave electrotherapy devices worth 636 million yuan, four X-ray machines worth more than 1.311 billion yuan, one hundred analytical balances worth 1.4 billion yuan, and forty ultraviolet lamps worth 240.5 million yuan.

    "Cannot Enter, Cannot Exit"

    The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation's warehouse management work is very chaotic. The links of receiving goods, inspection, storage, pricing, and allocation cannot be well connected. Therefore, as long as there is a problem in one link, drugs and medical equipment cannot be put into or taken out of the warehouse in time. They call this phenomenon "cannot enter, cannot exit." In December 1951, the company transferred a batch of Western medicine worth 900 million yuan from Shanghai. The deliveryman brought the goods, but the inspector said that a barrel of Anbi (a sudorific) was missing. Since one item could not be found, none of the others could be entered into the accounts. It was not until the warehouse was cleared in April 1952 that a barrel of Anbi was found in the corner of the warehouse, and then it was transferred to the warehouse. In November 1951, 150 barrels (53 gallons each) of Vaseline were imported. When entering the warehouse, the weigher said that it was more than one hundred pounds short, and the warehouse keeper refused to accept it, so it was stockpiled. Four months later, the weigher and the deliveryman re-weighed it and it turned out that there was more than enough. This resulted in the stockpiling of more than 300 million yuan of Vaseline for four months. In May 1951, the company's business section sold 1,500 kilograms of calcium gluconate, and the sales procedures had been completed. However, the warehouse keeper insisted that there was no calcium gluconate in the warehouse and could not deliver the goods, so they had to stop selling it. When the warehouse was cleared in December of the same year, it was discovered that this batch of medicine was pressed under a pile of goods. This resulted in more than 100.5 million yuan of funds being unable to be turned over for more than half a year.

    Even if some medical equipment and drugs have entered the warehouse and been transferred to the accounts, they cannot be taken out of the warehouse because the price cannot be set by the pricing section. Everyone calls the "pricing section" the "priceless section." The cadres of the pricing section neither understand the cost and specifications of the drugs, nor do they understand the needs of the people and regional price differences. Sometimes when goods arrive without a price, they randomly set the price. For example, in the spring of last year, six tons of lactose were imported. At that time, the market price of lactose was 52,000 yuan per pound. The business department of the head office, without understanding the market price, sold 3,000 pounds at 22,000 yuan per pound, causing market confusion. The costs of imported materials are very complex, but the pricing section does not study them and adds a 5% handling fee to all of them. As a result, some prices are too high, some prices are too low, and there are many "priceless commodities" that cannot be sold for a long time.

    Zhou Ji'an's Bureaucratic Work Style

    The main reason for this situation is that the company's manager, Zhou Ji'an, has a serious bureaucratic work style in leadership. Some cadres of the company described the situation of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation as: "Leading cadres are high above, middle-level cadres push and shove each other, and lower-level cadres are indifferent." Zhou Ji'an often sits in the office signing official documents, but a lot of damaged and waste products are piled up in the warehouse, some of which were imported as early as 1950, but have not been dealt with for a long time. The warehouse keepers have submitted several reports requesting instructions on how to deal with them, but he has not given any instructions. Sometimes when Zhou Ji'an sees a large pile of official documents and telegrams on his desk, he feels anxious and irritable, and then finds lower-level cadres to scold them. The cadres have many opinions about him, but they dare not raise them. He is an old cadre who has participated in the revolution for more than 20 years and carries a heavy "historical burden." He is unwilling to learn and does not seek progress. He often says to others, "I don't understand the business, I don't know how to operate, I am an amateur." He "only looks at the public announcements, circulars, and official documents of the Central Ministry of Commerce that mention the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, and does not look at those that do not." He rarely even reads the newspaper. He once said to others, "When I attend a study discussion meeting, I don't speak first. I listen to other people's speeches. When I hear almost enough, I find a loophole and say a few words to finish the matter." The company's cadres said: Manager Zhou often says he doesn't understand the business, so the old cadre should be very strong politically! But that is not the case. In the anti-bureaucracy struggle, when checking the problem of stockpiled materials in the company, the section chiefs and staff shirked their responsibilities and argued endlessly. When Zhou Ji'an made a mobilization report, he said, "Okay! Okay! Stop arguing. None of you are stockpiling, just assume that I am the one stockpiling. What's so great about admitting it? At most, it's half a year in prison." Such a "mobilization" can only have a bad effect, so the anti-bureaucracy struggle cannot be carried out smoothly. Because the leaders are divorced from the masses, the section chiefs, staff, and clerks feel that things are difficult to handle, and they are not motivated to work. Some cadres are "conscientious and do things according to their conscience." Some do it if they like it, and play if they don't like it. There are also some cadres who feel that "anyway, this company will collapse sooner or later, just wait! It would be a joke if it doesn't collapse, how can the Communist Party allow this to happen!" Many cadres were very enthusiastic when they came, but no one paid attention to their opinions, and their mood gradually declined day by day, and they just muddled through. This is the reason why the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation is in such a mess. This serious chaotic situation of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation cannot continue. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Commerce will immediately inspect and rectify the work of the company, and that those who have neglected their duties should be given the punishment they deserve.

    Editor's Note: The phenomenon of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation stockpiling and damaging a large quantity of drugs and medical equipment is absolutely intolerable. The serious irresponsible style of the leading cadres of the company has caused great losses to the country and the people. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Commerce will promptly inspect and rectify the work of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and give the manager of the company the punishment he deserves.

    中国医药公司为什么损坏了大批药品和医疗器械
    本报记者　沈文英
    中国医药公司领导干部不负责任，盲目经营，积压和损坏了大量贵重药品和医疗器械，给国家造成巨大损失。据初步统计，目前该公司积压和损坏的各种药品和医药器械约值二百一十五亿多元。因大量药品、医疗器械长期积压而支付的利息和残坏的损失，就有六十三亿五千八百万元。
    大批贵重药品失掉时效或变质
    在中国医药公司的仓库里，堆存着四万八千七百二十支青霉素，价值三亿九千万元。但这些青霉素已经完全失去时效了。青霉素是治肺炎的良药，一般小孩得了较重的肺炎，只要用六支青霉素就可治好。这就是说，这些青霉素如果不失效用，就可治好八千一百二十个患重肺炎的小孩。该公司有价值八千五百五十八万元的鹿茸精已经变质。有价值四亿六千八百多万元的“消发灭丁”粉的封口已经霉坏，部分药粉已变色。这些药品有的是中国进口公司调拨来的，有的是原中国工业器材公司移交来的，有的是中国医药公司西南区公司交来的，据说一来就是坏的。但中国医药公司接受了这批坏药品，既不追究原因和责任，也不向上级请示解决办法，又不迅速处理，而是往仓库里一堆了事。这些药不仅越放越坏，还要支出一大笔保管费用。
    四十台X光机在口岸上淌油
    去年十月，中国医药公司从国外购进四十台X光机。这批X光机在秦皇岛积压了一个多月，然后调到天津口岸。该公司不及时去验收，又在天津口岸上积压了二十多天。这批X光机被日晒风吹，直往箱外淌油。后来只得另外买了X光机油添上，才调拨出去了。该公司在天津花园路的器械仓库很潮湿，但有很多器械放在地下室内。结果，一百零五个X光机夹子生锈变成废料，七十二盒X光纸因受潮失去效用，三十九套比色计、三十八把鎗状刀生了锈。就这四种东西的损失即达一亿元以上。一九五一年八月，该公司进口一批“哥罗仿”（麻醉剂），因系危险品，不能在市内存放，就拿到市郊露天放着。这种药品挥发性很大，到一九五二年四月，三千八百八十瓶“哥罗仿”大半都成了空瓶，有少数还剩下半瓶。
    麦角膏和“阿地平”
    该公司向国外订购妇产科止血用的麦角原料，但因没有写明规格，结果买来一千瓶麦角清膏（每瓶七百公分），价值五十亿元。如把麦角清膏制成针剂，每瓶可制十四万七千支，但目前我国还没有制造这样大量针剂的制药厂。如制成内服剂，销量也不大。因为现在医疗部门多用比白阿膏和过氯化铁等止血剂。这些药品用途广，不像麦角膏只能用于妇科止血。这样就使五十亿元资金被积压十八个月，仅利息和费用的支出，即达二十九亿七千万元。该公司一九五二年进口“阿地平”五千公斤，本来要的是含量百分之百的药片五千片，但因没有注明单位名称，结果买来了含量三分之一的五千公斤。这些药片大小不一，碎片很多，需要加工后出售。但我国现有的制药厂不能大量加工，这样就使价值四十二亿五千多万元的“阿地平”积压近一年。该公司一九五二年三月进口六万九千二百四十块石棉过滤板，价值十三亿八千四百八十万元。据说这是中央卫生部请前中央贸易部国外贸易司订购的。石棉过滤板必须放在特制的漏斗上使用，但订购时没有购漏斗，这批过滤板只好放在仓库里压起来。
    不“理残”，不“索赔”
    “理残”，就是把有一点小小损坏的商品，修理一下出售。但该公司的工作人员不负责任，大家推来推去，都没有这样做。结果有些损坏的商品只好积压起来。“索赔”就是从外国购来货物，在进口后一定期限内发现确实已经残坏，可向对方要求赔偿。但是该公司不这样作，结果也造成了严重的积压和损失。其中损失最大的有：价值六亿三千六百万元的超短波电疗器十二台，价值十三亿一千一百多万元的X光机四台，价值十四亿元的分析天平一百台，价值二亿四千零五十万元的紫外线灯四十台。
    “进不来，出不去”
    中国医药公司的仓库管理工作很混乱，进货、验收、保管、作价、调拨等环节不能很好地衔接起来，因此，只要有一个环节出了问题，药品和医疗器械就不能及时入库或不能及时出库。他们把这种现象称为“进不来，出不去”。一九五一年十二月，该公司从上海调进价值九亿元的西药一批，提货员把货运来，但验收员说短少了一桶安吡（发汗剂）。一笔货查不到，其他都不能入账，一直到一九五二年四月份清仓时，才发现仓库墙角里有一桶安吡，这才转账入库。一九五一年十一月进口凡士林一百五十桶（五十三加仑装），入库时过磅员说少了一百多磅，保管员不肯收，就此积压起来。四个月后过磅员和提货员会磅。却又多出来了。这样使三亿多元的凡士林积压四个月。一九五一年五月该公司营业科出售葡萄糖酸钙一千五百公斤，已经办好销货手续，但保管员硬说仓库里没有，提不出货来，结果就只好不卖。到同年十二月份清仓时，才发现这批药压在货垛底下。这就使一亿零五百万元资金半年多不能翻身。
    有的医疗器械和药品，即使已经进了库、转了账，但因物价科订不出价格，也出不了库。大家都称“物价科”为“无价科”。物价科的干部既不了解药品的成本、规格，也不了解人民需要、地区差价。有时货物来了没有价格，他们就乱定价格。例如去年春天进口乳糖六吨，当时乳糖的市价是每磅五万二千元，总公司营业部不了解市场价格，就以每磅二万二千元出售了三千磅，引起了市场的混乱。进口物资的费用是很复杂的，但物价科不加以研究，就一律加上了百分之五的手续费，结果有些价太高，有些价太低，还有很多“无价商品”，长期没法推销。
    周吉安的官僚主义作风
    造成这种情况的主要原因是公司经理周吉安在领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风。该公司有的干部描绘中国医药公司的情况是：“领导干部高高在上，中级干部你推我让，下级干部吊而浪当。”周吉安经常坐在办公室内签署公文，但仓库里堆积了很多残品、废品，其中有些还是一九五○年进的货，却长期不加以处理。仓库保管人员打了几次报告请示处理办法，但他不作指示。周吉安有时看到办公桌上公文、电报一大堆，心里又急又烦，就找下级干部来发一顿脾气。干部们对他意见很多，但都不敢提。他是个参加革命二十多年的老干部，背上了沉重的“历史包袱”，不愿学习，不求进步，还常常对别人说：“我不懂得业务，不会经营，是个外行”。他对于中央商业部的公报、通报、公文是“提到中国医药公司的就看，不提到的就不看”。他连报纸也很少看。他曾对别人说：“开学习讨论会我先不发言，听一听人家发言，听得差不多了，就钻个空子，说上几句算完事。”公司的干部说：周经理常说不懂业务，那末老干部在政治上应该是很强的哪！但事实并不如此。在反官僚主义斗争中，检查到公司里积压物资问题时，科长、科员互相推脱责任，争吵不休。周吉安在作动员报告时却说：“得了！得了！你们别吵啦，你们都没有积压，就算是我积压的。承认了有什么了不起，顶多是半年徒刑。”这样的“动员”当然只能起坏作用，因此反官僚主义斗争不能顺利开展。由于领导者脱离群众，科长、科员、办事员觉得事情难办，工作都不起劲。有些干部是“安分守己，凭良心办事”。有的爱干就干，不爱干就玩玩。还有些干部觉得“反正这个公司迟早要垮，等着吧！不垮台倒是笑话，共产党还能允许这样做！”很多干部来时热情很高，但提了意见没有人理睬，慢慢地情绪一天天低落，也就得过且过了。这就是中国医药公司弄得一塌糊涂的原因。中国医药公司这种严重的混乱现象是不能再继续下去了，希望中央商业部立即检查和整顿该公司的工作，并应该给失职人员以应得的处分。
    编者按：中国医药公司积压和损坏大批药品和医疗器械的现象，是绝对不能容忍的。该公司领导干部严重的不负责任的作风，已给国家和人民造成极大的损失。希望中央商业部迅速检查和整顿中国医药公司的工作，并给该公司的经理以应得的处分。
