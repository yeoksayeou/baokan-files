    Great Achievements in Economic Construction of European People's Democracies in 1952
    Chen Youwei
    The European People's Democracies achieved new and significant successes in peaceful construction in 1952.
    The Communist and Workers' Parties, the leading forces in the European People's Democracies, following Lenin and Stalin's instructions on socialist construction and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, placed the development of industrial production in the primary position of economic construction. The characteristics of economic construction in these countries are the rapid development of heavy industrial production, the construction and commissioning of large-scale iron and steel plants, hydroelectric power stations, and other important factories and enterprises, as well as the establishment of new industrial production departments and the large-scale production of new industrial products.
    Poland's steel production in 1952 had increased to 3.3 million tons, exceeding the highest pre-liberation production year by about 130 percent. During the twenty years of capitalist rule, Poland did not build a single steelmaking plant, but in the eight years of the people's government, it has built and rebuilt eleven blast furnaces and twenty-five steelmaking furnaces. Czechoslovakia's industrial production in 1952 was nearly double that of pre-war levels, an increase of 17.8 percent over 1951, with machinery production increasing by nearly 40 percent and steel production increasing by nearly 27 percent. Czechoslovakia's current steel production has reached 3.7 million tons, and power generation has reached 11 billion kilowatt-hours. Hungary has also achieved remarkable success in the production of fuel, steel, and electricity. The average amount of coal available to each person in Hungary is now twice as high as before the war. Bulgaria completed its Five-Year Plan a year ahead of schedule last year, and its industrial output is now more than four times higher than before the war. Romania, which was originally relatively industrially backward, rapidly increased its steel and electricity production to two and a half times pre-war levels last year; its industry producing means of production now accounts for more than half of the entire industry—55.8 percent. The output of its young machine industry has increased by about thirty times compared to 1948. Albania's total industrial output in 1952 doubled compared to 1951, and is equal to seven and a half times that of the pre-war period.
    While heavy industry developed rapidly, the socialist component of industry in these countries continued to expand. The socialist component of Albania's industry has now reached 99 percent. The socialist economic component of other People's Democracies has also reached more than 95 to 99 percent of total industrial output. More than 52 percent of Romania's national income now comes from industry, and more than 80 percent of the industrial products of the German Democratic Republic are now produced by industries of a socialist nature.
    The growth of industrial production and the rapid expansion of the socialist economy in the European People's Democracies have greatly strengthened the leadership of the working class and its parties over the state and consolidated the alliance between the working class and the working peasants.
    In terms of agricultural production, although some countries suffered from unfavorable climatic conditions, they still made significant progress. Many countries expanded their cultivated area and increased yields per unit area. Albania's sown area in 1952 was more than half larger than in 1938. Despite the unfavorable climate for agriculture last year, Albania's wheat harvest still more than doubled compared to pre-war levels, and cotton production increased to seventy times pre-war levels. Poland harvested an average of one quintal more grain per hectare of land in 1952. Czechoslovakia has seen a large increase in livestock numbers. Compared with 1948, the number of beef cattle has increased by 24 percent, cows by 20 percent, edible pigs by 74 percent, and sheep by 13 percent. The supply of grain and agricultural products in the German Democratic Republic has improved, with nearly 600,000 tons more grain and 1.1 million tons of sugar beets harvested in 1952 than before the war.
    The rapid development of industrial production in the European People's Democracies has created favorable conditions for the increase of agricultural production in these countries. Thousands upon thousands of tractors, harvesters, and various new agricultural machines are transported from factories to the countryside, reducing the labor of farmers and increasing agricultural output. In 1952 alone, the Bulgarian People's Government supplied farmers with 800 tractors, 850 harvesters, and many other agricultural machines. In the autumn of last year alone, there were 12,000 tractors and 1,300 harvesters operating in Bulgaria's farmland. Poland's agricultural machinery industry supplied agriculture with a large number of new and first-time manufactured machines in 1952. The degree of agricultural mechanization in various countries is constantly increasing.
    The superiority of agricultural collectivization attracts and educates millions of working peasants in the European People's Democracies, causing more people to participate in collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives. In 1952, Romania had more than 1,600 collective farms. Three-fifths of Bulgaria's cultivated land is cultivated by agricultural cooperatives, and 53 percent of the country's farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms in Hungary now cultivate more than 37 percent of the country's cultivated land. The role played by the socialist component in the agriculture of various countries is growing, and the quantity of industrial raw materials, grain, and various agricultural products they produce is constantly increasing.
    The inevitable result of national economic development is a significant improvement in the people's living standards. The purpose of developing the national economy in the European People's Democracies is not for profit, but to continuously meet the growing material and cultural needs of the working people. The Communist and Workers' Parties and the People's Governments of these countries constantly care about the improvement of the people's welfare and take all necessary measures to achieve this goal. In 1952, many countries implemented currency reforms, lowered prices, and abolished the rationing system, which greatly improved the people's material lives. Bulgaria lowered prices twice in the past year. Albania's industry produced twice as much clothing, shoes, and socks and six times as much food for the people as before the war. The number of medical institutions in Poland increased to more than eleven times that of the pre-war period in 1952. At the beginning of this year, prices were lowered again, the rationing system was abolished, and wages were increased.
    At the same time, the cultural living standards of the people of the European People's Democracies have also improved significantly. Czechoslovakia published 90 million books last year, an average of seven or eight books per person per year, nearly three times more than before the war. Romania now has 2.4 million students studying in schools at all levels. Albania eradicated 82 percent of illiteracy in the 1951-1952 academic year. Hungary now has 54 higher education students per 10,000 people, one and a half times more than France and two and a half times more than Sweden.
    One of the main reasons for the great achievements of the European People's Democracies is the selfless assistance provided to them by the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "No capitalist country can give the People's Democracies real and technically skilled assistance in the way the Soviet Union is doing. The point is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The point is primarily that the basis for this cooperation is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve a common economic upsurge. As a result, there is a high rate of industrial development in these countries." The Soviet Union's exports of the latest machinery and equipment to the People's Democracies in 1952 have increased tenfold compared to 1948. The Soviet Union's assistance to the European People's Democracies is multifaceted, not only providing these countries with the finest machinery, equipment, and raw materials, but also providing technical and human assistance in the design of construction projects and the installation of factory equipment. Many steel plants, hydroelectric power stations, and other large construction projects in the European People's Democracies were designed, started, and built under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts.
    These brilliant achievements of the economic construction of the European People's Democracies in 1952 are clear evidence of the unparalleled superiority of the people's democratic and socialist systems over the capitalist system. While the economies of capitalist countries are stagnating or declining under the heavy pressure of military expansion and war preparation, and while civilian industries in those countries are withering, workers are experiencing mass unemployment, taxes are increasing, and prices are rising, a thriving atmosphere prevails everywhere in the European People's Democracies. Now the people of the European People's Democracies are confidently moving towards a socialist society, and with each passing year, they are moving closer to this lofty and beautiful goal.

    欧洲人民民主国家一九五二年经济建设的伟大成就
    陈有为
    欧洲人民民主国家在一九五二年的和平建设中又获得了新的巨大的成就。
    欧洲人民民主国家的领导力量——共产党和工人党，遵循着列宁、斯大林关于社会主义建设的指示，学习着苏联的先进经验，把发展工业生产放在经济建设的首要地位。这些国家经济建设中的特点，就是重工业生产的迅速发展，大批巨型钢铁厂、水电站与其他各种重要工厂企业的兴建和开工，以及新的工业生产部门的建立和新的工业产品的大量出产。
    波兰在一九五二年的钢产量已经增加到三百三十万吨，超过解放前产量最高年份的百分之一百三十左右。在资本主义统治时期的二十年内，波兰没有兴建过一个炼钢厂，而在人民政权的八年内，却已经新建和重建了十一座鼓风炉、二十五座炼钢炉。捷克斯洛伐克一九五二年的工业生产量已接近于战前的两倍，比一九五一年提高了百分之十七点八，其中机械工业的产量增加近百分之四十，钢产量增加近百分之二十七。现在捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量已达三百七十万吨，发电量达一百一十亿瓩时。匈牙利在燃料、钢与电力生产方面也获得了很显著的成就。现在匈牙利全国平均每人所得的煤量已较战前增加了两倍。保加利亚于去年提前一年完成了五年计划，它的工业产量现在已较战前增加四倍以上。原来工业比较落后的罗马尼亚已经在去年把它的钢与电力产量迅速地增加到战前的两倍半；它生产生产资料的工业，现在已占整个工业的一半以上——百分之五十五点八。它的年轻的机器工业产量比一九四八年增加了三十倍左右。阿尔巴尼亚一九五二年的工业总生产量比一九五一年增加了一倍，而等于战前的七倍半。
    在重工业迅速发展的同时，这些国家工业的社会主义成分也在不断扩大。现在阿尔巴尼亚工业中的社会主义成分已达到了百分之九十九。其他人民民主国家的社会主义经济成分，在工业总产量中亦已达到了百分之九十五至九十九以上。罗马尼亚现在的国民收入有百分之五十二以上来自工业，德意志民主共和国现在有百分之八十以上的工业产品是由社会主义性质的工业所生产的。
    欧洲人民民主国家工业生产的增长和社会主义经济的迅速扩展，大大地加强了工人阶级及其政党对国家的领导，并巩固了工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟。
    在农业生产方面，虽然有些国家遭受到气候的不利影响，但仍然获得了显著的进展。许多国家扩大了耕地面积和提高了单位面积的产量。阿尔巴尼亚的播种面积在一九五二年比一九三八年扩大了一半以上。尽管去年的气候不利于农业，但阿尔巴尼亚的小麦收获量还是比战前增加了一倍以上，棉花产量增加到战前的七十倍。波兰一九五二年在每一公顷的土地上平均多收获了一生丁纳的谷物。捷克斯洛伐克的牲畜头数有了很大的增加。与一九四八年相比较，食用牛的头数增加了百分之二十四，母牛增加了百分之二十，食用猪增加了百分之七十四，绵羊增加了百分之十三。民主德国的粮食与农产品的供应已有改善，在一九五二年比战前多收获了近六十万吨谷物和一百一十万吨甜菜。
    欧洲人民民主国家工业生产的迅速发展，为这些国家的农业生产的增加创造了有利的条件。成千成万架的拖拉机、收割机与各种新式的农业机器，从工厂运往农村，减轻了农民的劳动，提高了农业的产量。保加利亚人民政府在一九五二年一年内供给农民以八百架拖拉机，八百五十架收割机和许多别的农业机器。仅仅在去年秋季里，在保加利亚的农田中操作的就有一万二千架拖拉机和一千三百架收割机。波兰的农业机器工业在一九五二年以大批新式的与第一次制造的机器供给农业使用。各国的农业机械化程度正在不断地提高。
    农业集体化的优越性，吸引着与教育着欧洲人民民主国家的千百万劳动农民，使更多的人参加了集体农场与农业生产合作社。在一九五二年，罗马尼亚已有一千六百个以上的集体农场。保加利亚全国五分之三的耕地已由农业合作社来耕种，全国百分之五十三的农户参加了农业合作社。匈牙利的农业生产合作社与国营农场现在耕种着全国百分之三十七以上的耕地。各国农业中的社会主义成分所起的作用愈来愈大，它们生产的工业原料和粮食以及各种农产品的数量正在不断增加着。
    国民经济发展的必然结果是人民生活水平的显著提高。欧洲人民民主国家发展国民经济的目的，不是为了利润，而是为了不断地满足劳动人民在物质与文化生活上的日益增长的需要。这些国家的共产党、工人党和人民政府，经常地关怀着人民生活福利的提高，并采取一切必要的措施来实现这一目的。在一九五二年内，许多国家实行了币制改革，降低了物价，废除了配给制，因而极大地改善了人民的物质生活。保加利亚在去年一年内两次降低了物价。阿尔巴尼亚的工业为全国人民生产了为战前两倍的衣着鞋袜和六倍的食品。波兰的医疗机构数目在一九五二年增加到战前的十一倍多。在今年年初又降低了物价，废除了配给制，和提高了工资。
    与此同时，欧洲各人民民主国家人民的文化生活水平也有显著的提高。捷克斯洛伐克去年出版的书籍已达九千万册，平均每人每年可得七、八册，这个数字比战前增加了近三倍。罗马尼亚现在有二百四十万学生分别在各级学校中学习。阿尔巴尼亚在一九五一—一九五二的学年内消灭了文盲的百分之八十二。匈牙利现在全国人口中每一万人就有五十四个高等学校的学生，比法国多一倍半，比瑞典多两倍半。
    欧洲人民民主国家之所以获得如此巨大的成就，其主要原因之一，是苏联对它们的大公无私的帮助。斯大林同志在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中曾经指出：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”苏联在一九五二年向人民民主国家输出的最新式的机器和设备，已增加到一九四八年的十倍。苏联对欧洲人民民主国家的援助是多方面的，不仅以最精良的机器、装备和原料供给这些国家，而且还在建设工程的设计，工厂企业的设备的装置方面，提供了技术上的与人力上的帮助。欧洲人民民主国家的许多钢铁厂、水电站与其他巨大的建设工程，都是在苏联专家的指导与帮助之下设计、兴工和建成的。
    欧洲人民民主国家一九五二年经济建设的这些光辉成就，是人民民主与社会主义制度较之资本主义制度无比优越的明证。当资本主义国家的经济在扩军备战的重压之下裹足不前或者日渐衰落的时候，当那些国家里的民用工业凋蔽、工人大批失业、赋税增加与物价高涨的时候，在欧洲人民民主国家里却到处呈现着欣欣向荣的气象。现在欧洲人民民主国家的人民正在满怀信心地向着社会主义社会前进，每过一年，他们也就更进一步地接近了这个崇高美好的目标。（附图片）
