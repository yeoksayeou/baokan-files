    Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on February 21st, protesting the Eisenhower government's deliberate killing of American citizens Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The full text of the statement is as follows: Ignoring the protests of the American people and upright people of all countries, Eisenhower brazenly refused to overturn the unreasonable death sentence by electrocution against the Rosenbergs on February 11th. The U.S. ruling clique's framing of innocent American people who advocate for peace and freedom with trumped-up charges once again exposes the U.S. government's crimes of suppressing its own people and undermining world peace, further arousing resolute opposition from upright people in the United States and around the world. The Chinese working class feels boundless anger at Eisenhower and his government's barbaric atrocities that violate human justice, strangle democratic freedom, and trample on basic human rights. The Chinese working class hereby lodges a serious protest with the U.S. authorities and fully supports the just demand of the American people to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the original verdict and retry the case.

    我全国总工会发表声明抗议美国政府蓄意杀害罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社二十一日讯】中华全国总工会二十一日发表声明，抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意杀害美国善良公民罗森堡夫妇，声明全文如下：艾森豪威尔不顾美国人民和世界各国正直人民的抗议，竟于二月十一日悍然拒绝撤销对罗森堡夫妇的电刑处死的无理判决。美国统治集团这种以莫须有的罪名陷害美国主张和平与自由的善良人民，又一次暴露了美国政府镇压国内人民、破坏世界和平的罪行，更加引起美国和世界各国正直人民的坚决反对。中国工人对于艾森豪威尔及其政府这种违反人类正义、扼杀民主自由、蹂躏基本人权的野蛮暴行感到无比的愤怒。中国工人特向美国当局提出严重抗议，并完全支持美国人民向美国最高法院提出的撤销原判、重新审判的正义要求。
