    Introduction to the Korean Railway Art Troupe
    The Korean Railway Art Troupe is an artistic unit that grew up during the war. In 1947, the original Ministry of Transportation Club was reorganized into the Ministry of Railways Club. At that time, the entire staff consisted of only seventy people. In 1951, it was reorganized into the Ministry of Railways Art Theater, and the number of cadres increased to 226, including drama and dance actors, composers, poets, and writers. The internal organization was divided into four departments: chorus, orchestra, dance troupe, and drama troupe.
    The members of this art troupe are selected from railway workers. They are not only familiar with the situation of the Korean railways and the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of workers, but also are all well-tempered soldiers. After the start of the Fatherland Liberation War, the entire troupe was divided into groups to conduct comfort performances in the railway factories and lines of the liberated areas. In 1952, they toured various places, trekking more than 3,000 *ri* (every ten *ri* equals four kilometers), and cultivated and guided more than 1,300 amateur art units of workers. They have close ties with the masses and are welcomed by the broad masses of workers. They often inspire the fighting will of the workers and play a great role in guaranteeing the completion of national transportation. Due to their outstanding contributions to the country, more than 50 members of the troupe have won the National Flag Medal and Military Service Medal.

    朝鲜铁道艺术团介绍
    朝鲜铁道艺术团是在战争中成长起来的一支艺术部队。一九四七年，原交通省俱乐部改组为铁道省俱乐部，当时全部人员仅有七十名。一九五一年又改组为铁道省艺术剧院，干部增加到二百二十六人，其中有戏剧歌舞演员、作曲家、诗人和作家，内部组织分合唱团、管弦乐团、舞蹈团、剧团等四个部门。
    这个艺术团的成员是由铁路职工中选拔出来的，他们不但熟悉朝鲜铁路情况和广大职工的思想感情，同时他们本身也全是经过千锤百炼的战士。祖国解放战争开始以后，全团分组到解放区铁路工厂、线路进行慰问演出。一九五二年他们到各地巡回演出，徒步跋涉了三千多朝里（每十朝里等于四公里），并培养指导着一千三百多个职工业余艺术单位。他们和群众有着紧密的联系，受到广大职工的欢迎。他们经常激励着职工的战斗意志，对完成国家运输起了很大保证作用。由于他们对国家的卓越贡献，因此该团已有五十多名团员荣获国旗勋章和军功章。
