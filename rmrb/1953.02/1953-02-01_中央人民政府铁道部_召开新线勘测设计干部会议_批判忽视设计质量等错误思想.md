The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a cadre meeting on new line survey and design from January 19th to 28th. More than 100 working cadres from various survey and design general teams, design sub-bureaus, and design bureaus attended the meeting.

The meeting summarized the design work of new railway lines in 1952 and arranged the tasks for 1953. The meeting unanimously agreed that the current phenomenon of design work lagging behind construction and the quality being low is very serious. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the design ideology has not been corrected in time. This erroneous design ideology is manifested in: 1. Blindly pursuing quantity and neglecting quality, failing to collect sufficient data and conduct repeated research with multiple comparative plans. For example, when selecting the route for the northern section of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway, the geological conditions were not studied. It was not until the final determination that Soviet experts discovered the poor geological conditions, and the route had to be re-selected. 2. Simply accommodating current construction convenience and not considering the quality of the new line after it is completed, rejecting good comparative plans. For example, near Donggang Town in Lanzhou on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the route should have passed through a mountain, but under the guidance of erroneous thinking, it went around from the river bank, resulting in very poor line quality. 3. Being fond of grand achievements, not making various plans based on actual needs and development prospects, but pursuing so-called "Far East first" or "world first." For example, the design of the new Xi'an Station is sufficient for development twenty years later; a very large marshalling yard was built in 1952, resulting in extreme waste. Some are constrained by old plans, failing to actively conduct investigations and research, and failing to find better plans. In terms of design work style and methods, there are phenomena of carelessness and irresponsibility, which slow down the design work and lead to many errors. For example, after the detailed survey and design of the southern section of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway, it was discovered during inspection that a section of the railway was located in the river valley, and more than 20 places in 120 kilometers of line needed to be modified. According to incomplete statistics from the Southwest Design Sub-bureau, more than 10,000 workdays were spent on rework due to design errors, most of which could have been avoided.

The meeting paid great attention to the new force in the railway survey and design personnel. This new force is constantly fighting against the old work style in survey and design, and many exemplary deeds have emerged. Taking the 17th Survey and Design General Team as an example, after the team launched rationalization proposals last September, it put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals in more than two months, and it is estimated that those adopted can save the country more than 390 billion yuan. For example, drilling workers Chen Yuxiu and Han Yun, in order to overcome the difficulty of the lack of drilling machines, proposed improvements to the hand-cranked drill. After technician Ma Wenliang repeatedly researched and improved the drill bit, the hand-cranked drill was able to drill cores of harder rock formations, greatly increasing the role of the hand-cranked drill. Engineers Lan Tian and Guo Yi of the Southwest Design Sub-bureau, when selecting the route for the southern section of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway, visited local farmers, conducted in-depth investigations and research, improved the past design, shortened the line, reduced the number of long tunnels and viaducts, and avoided a waste of 120 billion yuan. The fifth detachment led by Liu Tieyan of the Sixth Survey and Design General Team, when surveying the Wuwei-Zhangye section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, relatively completely used the route selection method, attached importance to collecting data, and closely relied on the masses and promoted democracy in its work, putting forward the slogan of "ask more, run more, see more, think more, and compare more lines," humbly listened to the opinions of residents, overcame the difficulties of crossing the Hexi Corridor plateau, and shortened the line by thirteen kilometers compared with the old survey line.

After the meeting discussed the survey and design tasks, technical organizational measures, and other issues for 1953, Minister Teng Daiyuan and Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao attended the meeting and gave reports, seriously criticizing the sloppy and trouble-averse work style of the survey and design personnel, and calling on all railway survey and design personnel to establish a honest and practical scientific attitude and continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living. After listening to the above reports, the responsible cadres of various design sub-bureaus and their subordinate teams made preliminary checks and resolved to return to the site, and in conjunction with the deployment of tasks and the summary of work, further mobilize all staff to check incorrect ideological styles and improve the quality of design work.

    中央人民政府铁道部
    召开新线勘测设计干部会议
    批判忽视设计质量等错误思想
    中央人民政府铁道部于一月十九日至二十八日举行新线勘测设计干部会议。到会有各勘测设计总队、设计分局和设计局工作干部一百余人。
    会议总结了一九五二年新线铁路的设计工作，布置了一九五三年的任务。会议一致认为目前设计工作落后于施工以及质量不高的现象很严重。产生这种现象的原因，主要是设计思想没有及时端正。这种错误的设计思想表现为：一、盲目追求数量忽视质量，不搜集充足资料和多做比较方案进行反复研究。如天成路北段选线时未研究地质情况，直到最后确定时，经苏联专家发觉地质情况恶劣，不得不另行选线。二、单纯迁就目前施工方便，不考虑新线修通后的质量，对好的比较方案拒不采纳。如天兰路兰州东岗镇附近本应穿过一座山，但由于错误思想的指导，从河岸上绕过去，使线路质量非常不好。三、好大喜功，不根据实际需要及发展前途作出各种方案，而是追求所谓“远东第一”、“世界第一”。如新建西安车站的设计足可供二十年后发展之用；一九五二年就修筑了一个很大的调车场，浪费极大。有的则为旧方案所束缚，不积极进行调查研究，不能找出更好的方案。在设计工作作风和方法方面，存在着马虎草率和不负责任的现象，使设计工作进行迟缓，并且错误很多。如天成路南段定测设计后，经检查才发觉其中有一段铁路定到河谷中去了，一百二十公里线路中有二十几处需要修改。据西南设计分局不完全的统计，因设计错误而返工的达一万工日以上，其中大多数是可以避免的。
    会议对于铁路勘测设计人员中的新生力量给予很大重视。这批新生的力量正不断向勘测设计中的旧作风进行斗争，而且出现了不少模范事迹。以第十七勘测设计总队为例，该队于去年九月开展合理化建议后，两个多月就提出合理化建议二百余件，其中被采纳的，估计可为国家节省三百九十多亿元。如钻探工陈玉秀、韩云为了克服钻探机缺乏的困难，提出改进手摇钻的建议，经技工马文良多次研究将钻头改进后，已经使手摇钻能够钻取较硬岩层的岩心，大大发挥了手摇钻的作用。西南设计分局工程师蓝田、郭彝等在选择天成路南段线路时，访问了当地农民，深入调查研究，改进过去的设计，缩短了线路，减去了若干长山洞、高架桥，避免了一万二千亿元的浪费。第六勘测设计总队刘铁岩领导的第五分队，在勘测兰新路武威张掖段时，比较完整地运用了选线方法，重视搜集资料，并且在工作中紧紧依靠群众，发挥民主，提出“多问、多跑、多看、多想、多做比较线”的口号，虚心听取居民的意见，克服了穿越河西走廊高原的困难，且较旧测线路缩短十三公里。
    会议在讨论一九五三年勘测设计任务、技术组织措施等问题后，滕代远部长、吕正操副部长到会作报告，严肃地批判了勘测设计人员中马虎、怕麻烦的作风，号召全体铁路勘测设计人员要树立老老实实的科学态度，继续发扬艰苦朴素的作风。各设计分局及所属各队负责干部听了上述报告后，作了初步检查，决心回现场后，结合布置任务、总结工作，进一步发动全体工作人员检查不正确的思想作风，提高设计工作的质量。
