Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Under the policy of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, the economic crisis in the capitalist world has further deepened in 1952.

The American-launched war of aggression against Korea once caused a short-term "prosperity" in the capitalist world. However, the adverse consequences of national economic militarization, such as inflation, soaring prices, increased taxes, and declining wages, have made the masses of people in capitalist countries more impoverished and the contradiction between production and consumption more acute. As a result, trade has returned to a slump, and the crisis of overproduction has resurfaced.

Inflation has generally reduced the income of working people in capitalist countries. In the United States, even Truman admitted in his last economic message to Congress that a quarter of families do not even earn half of the income needed to maintain a minimum standard of living, and a third of families are in debt. In 1952, British workers' real wages fell by 20 percent compared with before the war, and are still falling. In France and Italy, real wages in 1952 were less than half of pre-war levels. Even so, the people of these countries have to bear heavy taxes, especially the American people. In 1953, the federal tax burden on the American people increased by more than 70 percent compared with 1950. The amount directly deducted from personal income increased by about 80 percent, which is twelve times more than before the war. As the people become more impoverished, their purchasing power has also fallen sharply, which has greatly reduced the market for commodity sales in capitalist countries. In the United States, the amount of inventory has increased significantly. According to estimates in mid-December 1952, the value of manufactured goods accumulated in wholesale and retail industries increased by 1 billion US dollars compared with the same period in 1951. The significant increase in credit sales is another manifestation of the financial difficulties of the American people. At the end of 1952, the total amount of credit was 2.6 billion US dollars more than at the end of 1951. The ratio of credit amount to national income has exceeded the eve of the Great Depression in 1929. In the United Kingdom, the situation of domestic market contraction is roughly the same. In the first half of 1952, the number of non-food retail stores in the United Kingdom that closed down due to poor business was 44 percent more than in the same period in 1951, creating a post-war record. As for food, the wartime rationing system is still maintained in the United Kingdom, and the rations are decreasing rather than increasing.

The poverty of the people in capitalist countries has not only shrunk the domestic sales market of these countries, but also shrunk the world market of the capitalist world. The protective or retaliatory restrictions on mutual imports between various monopoly capital groups have worsened this situation. In the entire capitalist world, trade in 1952 was on a downward trend. The total value of foreign trade in the second quarter decreased by 5 percent compared with the first quarter, and the third quarter decreased by 7 percent compared with the second quarter. The situation in the United States is even more so. Exports of non-war materials in the first quarter were 4 billion US dollars, which dropped to 3.5 billion US dollars in the second quarter, and then to 2.75 billion US dollars in the third quarter. The United Kingdom, which relies on foreign trade, has tried its best to increase exports, but the value of exports in 1952 still decreased almost every month. Compared with January, the value of exports in December decreased by more than 46 million pounds, a drop of about 18 percent. The situation in France is the same. The value of exports in the first eleven months of 1952 decreased by more than 11 percent compared with the same period in 1951. The struggle among capitalist countries for commodity markets is becoming increasingly fierce.

The decline in domestic and foreign trade exceeded the extent that military spending could offset. As a result, despite the huge increase in arms production, the overall industrial production of the capitalist world began to shrink. In the United States, the total industrial production in the first nine months of 1952 decreased by 3 percent compared with the same period in 1951. According to the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the amount of orders on hand for American manufacturers in November 1952 had decreased for two consecutive months, and the number of new orders received also decreased by 2 percent compared with October. The total industrial production in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 1952 decreased by 7 percent compared with the same period in 1951. According to estimates by the British "Economist" magazine, the total production in the United Kingdom in 1952 decreased by 3 percent compared with the level in 1951. Industrial production in France is also shrinking, with the fourth quarter of 1952 being about 3.3 percent lower than the first quarter. The glass, textile, and paper industries have declined particularly sharply. The reduction in production has caused serious phenomena of insufficient industrial operation and enterprise closures, and at the same time has led to a sharp increase in the number of unemployed. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the number of unemployed in November 1952, according to official statistics, increased by about 170,000 compared with the monthly average in 1951. At present, in the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy, and Japan alone, there are 32 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people.

An important reaction to the reduction in industrial production is the surplus and price drop of raw materials. The average price of basic industrial raw materials in the United Kingdom in October 1952 was 16 percent lower than in the same period in 1951, and 30 percent lower than the peak in March 1951 after the outbreak of the Korean War. Among them, Malaysian rubber, which accounts for a major share in earning US dollar foreign exchange, fell in price by more than 60 percent due to the United States stopping stockpiling, and the price drop of tin was similar.

The phenomenon of raw material price drops also occurred in the United States. According to materials from late October 1952, the average price of 28 kinds of raw materials in the United States fell by 28 percent compared with the peak after the outbreak of the Korean War. But today, the most acute manifestation of the economic crisis in the United States is still the surplus and price drop of agricultural products. As of July 1952, the amount of unsold wheat in the United States reached 254 million bushels, exceeding the highest level during the economic crisis from 1929 to 1933. It is estimated that the amount of accumulated stock this year will increase significantly. The accumulation of cotton is also very serious. As the inventory of agricultural products increases, prices drop sharply. In 1952, the price of agricultural products fell by 12 percent, and the income of American farmers in 1952 decreased by 8 percent as a result. This greatly reduced the living standards of farmers, and at the same time further reduced the purchasing power of farmers for industrial products, which is bound to promote the crisis of overproduction that has already shown signs in industry.

    资本主义世界经济危机加深
    【新华社三日讯】在加紧扩军备战政策下，一九五二年资本主义世界的经济危机已进一步加深。
    美国所发动的侵略朝鲜战争，在资本主义世界里曾引起一个短期的“繁荣”景象。但是由于国民经济军事化所造成的通货膨胀，物价飞涨，赋税增加，工资下降等恶果，已使资本主义国家人民大众更加贫困，生产与消费之间的矛盾更加尖锐，结果是贸易重新趋于低落，生产过剩的危机再次显露。
    通货膨胀已使资本主义国家劳动人民收入普遍降低。在美国，连杜鲁门在他向国会提出的最后一个经济咨文中也承认，有四分之一的家庭甚至连维持最低限度生活所需要的一半的收入都赚不到，有三分之一的家庭欠债。英国工人在一九五二年内的实际工资比大战前下降百分之二十，而且还在下降。法国和意大利在一九五二年内的实际工资不及战前水平的一半。即使如此，这些国家的人民还要负担沉重的赋税，其中特别是美国人民。一九五三年美国人民的联邦捐税负担比一九五○年增加百分之七十以上。其中直接从个人收入抽取的数额更是增加了约百分之八十，比大战前增加了十二倍。人民更加贫困了，他们的购买力也就急剧地跌落，这使得资本主义国家内商品销售的市场大大缩小。在美国，存货的数量已大量增加，据一九五二年十二月中旬的估计，批发和零售业中积压的制造品的价值比一九五一年同时期增加了十亿美元。赊帐生意的显著增加是美国人民手头拮据的另一表现，一九五二年年底，赊帐总额比一九五一年年底多二十六亿美元。赊帐数额对国民收入的比例已超过一九二九年大恐慌前夕。在英国，国内市场萎缩的情形也大致相同。一九五二年上半年，英国非食品零售商店因生意清淡而倒闭的数字比一九五一年同时期多了百分之四十四，造成战后的最高纪录。至于食品，在英国仍然维持着战时的配给制，而且配给量有减无增。
    资本主义国家人民的贫困不仅缩小了这些国家国内的销货市场，而且也缩小了资本主义世界的世界市场。各国垄断资本集团之间对相互入口的保护性或报复性的限制，使这种情形更加恶化。整个资本主义世界，一九五二年的贸易是走着下坡路的，第二季对外贸易总值比第一季减少了百分之五，第三季比第二季又减少了百分之七。美国的情形更其如此，第一季非战争物资的出口为四十亿美元，第二季降为三十五亿美元，第三季再降至二十七亿五千万美元。靠对外贸易为生的英国，虽然想尽办法增加输出，但一九五二年的出口货值差不多仍逐月减少。十二月份与一月比较，出口货值减少了四千六百多万镑，跌落了大约百分之十八。法国的情况也是一样，一九五二年头十一个月出口货值比一九五
    一年同时期减少了百分之十一强。各资本主义国家间争夺商品市场的斗争正日趋激烈。
    国内外贸易的衰退，超过了军备开支所能抵补的程度，结果是，尽管军备生产有了巨大增加，资本主义世界工业总的生产却开始了萎缩。在美国，一九五二年头九个月工业总生产量比一九五一年同时期减少了百分之三，据美国“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载，一九五二年十一月份美国制造商手头的定货数额已经连续两月减少，新收到的定货的数目也比十月份下降了百分之二。一九五二年第三季英国工业总生产量比一九五一年同时期减少了百分之七。据英国“经济学家”杂志估计，一九五二年全年英国总生产量比一九五一年的水平下降百分之三。法国的工业生产也在缩减，一九五二年第四季比第一季低约百分之三点三。玻璃、纺织、纸张等工业下降得特别多。生产缩减造成了工业开工不足和企业倒闭的严重现象，同时使失业人数急剧增加。以英国为例，一九五二年十一月份失业人数，据官方统计，比一九五一年每月平均数增加了约十七万人。目前，仅在美国、英国、西德、意大利和日本，失业和半失业的就有三千二百万人。
    工业生产缩减的一个重要反应就是原料过剩与跌价。英国基本工业原料平均价格在一九五二年十月份比一九五一年同时期下降了百分之十六，比一九五一年三月、朝鲜战争爆发后最高峰下跌了百分之三十。其中在赚取美元外汇中占主要地位的马来亚橡胶，由于美国停止囤购，价格跌了百分之六十以上，锡价的跌落也类此。
    美国也发生原料跌价的现象。根据一九五二年十月下旬材料，美国二十八种原料价格与朝鲜战争爆发后的高峰相比，平均下跌了百分之二十八。但今天美国经济危机最尖锐的表现还是在农产品的过剩与跌价上。截至一九五二年七月为止，美国销不掉的小麦达二亿五千四百万蒲式耳，超过一九二九年到一九三三年经济危机时期的最高水平，据估计今年积存量还要大大增加。棉花积压的情况也很严重。随着农产品存货的增多，价格急剧跌落。一九五二年一年，农产品的价格跌落了百分之十二，一九五二年美国农民的收入因此减少了百分之八。这大大地降低了农民的生活水平，同时进一步减低了农民对于工业品的购买力，势必促进工业中已经显露端倪的生产过剩的危机。
