Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: The morale of the US aggressor troops in Korea is low, they are corrupt and degenerate, and the problem of crime is serious. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 8th, "Military courts in Korea try twelve to fifteen US Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps soldiers each month for drug offenses, and slightly more for murder, rape, robbery, or other acts of violence. This number was revealed in court records released on the 8th by the Eighth Army, the Korean Transportation Zone, the First Marine Division, and the Fifth Air Force."

The report said, "Eighth Army officers have expressed obvious concern about the number of drug cases." But, in fact, the number of US troops using drugs is much higher than this figure. Even the Associated Press admitted, "There are many drug offenders who have not been caught and brought to trial." According to American Cardinal Spellman, military doctors in Korea told him that the number of drug users was "alarmingly large." Soldiers who use drugs often commit other crimes as well. The Associated Press admits, "Some soldiers engage in black market transactions or theft in order to get money to buy drugs."

In addition to drug cases, according to the Associated Press, thirty-one people in the US Eighth Army, Fifth Air Force, and Marine Corps were tried for rape, in addition to many cases of murder, assault, and other acts of violence. One US military official admitted that some cases were "very dirty."

The US military authorities take a laissez-faire attitude towards soldiers' crimes. For example, the US Marine Corps "usually does not send drug offenders to military court, but sends them back to the United States with an 'administrative' discharge." Of the seven Marine Corps soldiers convicted of murder, "only one was convicted of murder, and the rest were convicted of manslaughter."

    侵朝美军士气败坏道德堕落
    【新华社十二日讯】侵朝美军士气败坏，腐化堕落，犯罪问题严重。据美联社汉城八日电说：“在朝鲜的军事法庭每个月要审讯十二个到十五个犯吸毒罪的美国陆军、空军和海军陆战队士兵，因谋杀、强奸、抢劫或其他暴行罪受审的人数还要多一点。这个数字是第八军、朝鲜交通区、海军陆战队第一师和第五航空队八日所发表的法庭记录透露的。”
    消息说：“第八军军官对吸毒案件的数目明显表示忧虑。”但是，事实上，美军吸毒人数要比这个数字多得多。连美联社也承认：“还有许多吸毒犯一直没有被抓到和送去受审。”据美国红衣主教斯培尔曼说，在朝鲜的军医告诉他，吸毒人数是“惊人大量”的。吸毒士兵往往还犯别的罪行。美联社承认：“有一些士兵为了要弄钱去买毒品，就进行黑市交易或偷窃。”
    除了吸毒案件外，据美联社说，在美国第八军和第五航空队、海军陆战队有三十一个人因强奸罪受审，此外，还有许多杀人、殴打和其他暴行等案件。一个美军官员承认：有一些案子“非常肮脏”。
    美军当局对于士兵犯罪采取纵容的态度。如美国海军陆战队“通常不把吸毒犯送军事法庭，而是把他们送回美国，给以‘行政的’开除处分。”在七个被判杀人罪的海军陆战队士兵中，“只有一个被判了谋杀罪，其余的都被判过失杀人。”
