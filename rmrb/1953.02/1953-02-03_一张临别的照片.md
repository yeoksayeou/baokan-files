    A Farewell Photograph
    Zhao Shuli
    Last year (1952), I stayed in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province for more than three months to understand agricultural producers' cooperatives. At that time, a documentary film crew from the Beijing Film Studio was there filming, and many comrades from units related to rural mutual aid and cooperation work were also there to assist, which was quite lively for a while. Upon parting, the cadres of the agricultural producers' cooperative and I took a photograph together as a memento of this joyful gathering. Recently, a comrade who went with the Beijing Film Studio gave me a copy of the developed photograph. When I saw it, it didn't seem like the scene of that day - the number of people was almost like a mass meeting. Looking closely, all the faces were familiar; not only was no one added, but many cadres were not present (because they were busy with other work and couldn't make it). It was just that the photo was taken facing the open riverbank, and only a few feet of space in front were captured, so it seemed like there were more people.
    The "agricultural producers' cooperative," this new type of agricultural production organization, requires so much work and so many people, far beyond my imagination. I will first present a few strange numbers for everyone to consider: Their cooperative expanded to 76 households after last autumn's harvest, and there were 68 necessary cadre positions, with at least 51 that could not be held concurrently. This is only the cooperative's cadres. If we include the cadres of various party, government, military, youth league, and mass organizations, there are probably more than 100 positions. However, the number of households in this village, including the five households in the small mountain village five li away, is only 94 in total. Does everyone find this ratio of cadres to households in this village and cooperative startling?
    This startling ratio seems normal and indispensable to the people of Chuandi Village - missing one, big or small, and there would always be something no one could handle. Our countryside is the most extensive grassroots organization in our country. Though the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. Whatever institutions there are at the central level, in most cases, they must have related institutions (whether they should be adjusted, reduced, or merged in the future is another matter). Since it is a village, it must have a village government; if there are a certain number of Party and Youth League members, there must be Party and Youth League branches; if there are militia, there must be armed organizations; if there are masses, there must be mass organizations. Thus, there must be a village government chairman, vice-chairman, and committees for civil affairs, finance and food, construction, culture and education, health, preferential treatment for military dependents, and mediation, as well as Party and Youth League branch secretaries, committee members, group leaders, militia captains, political directors, group leaders, women's federation chairpersons, group leaders... all indispensable. Their agricultural producers' cooperative plants several hundred mu of land, raises several hundred sheep and dozens of head of draft animals, cultivates many forests and fruit trees, and constantly repairs canals, dams, houses, and cave dwellings... there is income everywhere, and expenses everywhere. There are economic exchanges with cooperative members, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, insurance companies, veterinarians, pharmacies... If there are not enough cadres to take charge separately, not only will the production results be impossible to check, but even the daily expenses of how much cash and grain should be prepared cannot be calculated. Thus, there must be a cooperative affairs committee, a supervisory committee, chairmen and vice-chairmen, deputy team leaders in agriculture, forestry, sheep raising, draft animal management, basic construction management, sideline business operation, and cultural and educational welfare work, all of whom must have responsible persons in charge, and all departments except culture and education must have accountants. To facilitate the inspection of production results, each department must have a cost accounting system; to uniformly control income and expenditure, budgets must be prepared regularly. With these economic systems in place, there must be a general organization to manage these systems, so there must be general finance, general accounting, cashiers, grain keepers, custodians of agricultural implements and other public property, disbursers, and purchasers. These are only the indispensable institutions and personnel for production. Because the social division of labor cannot keep up with the needs of this emerging production organization, some supplementary institutions outside of production must also be established. For example, a housewife from an eight-person family must process thirty to forty shi of coarse grain into rice and flour every year, make more than twenty pairs of shoes, more than a dozen sets of clothes, cook three meals a day, and take care of children; although a single person has fewer of these chores, the quantity may be less, but the items are no less numerous (except for not having children). It is very difficult for these people to participate in the cooperative's labor. To alleviate some of their difficulties, mills, cafeterias, and nurseries must be opened, which requires more people. In short: things are done by people, and to do things, there must be people.
    Are there so many people? New people can do new things, and new things can also train new people. They have gone through the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the ongoing support for the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which has not only trained the existing village-level Party, government, military, and mass cadres, but has also sent dozens of county and district-level cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Similarly, in production, they have also trained various cadres from mutual aid and cooperation who are generally competent enough to take on the troublesome tasks I mentioned earlier.
    I used to worry about their level of education, but now, based on practical experience, while insufficient education is still a difficulty, it is not as bad as I estimated - in terms of technology, a few people can use modern bookkeeping, understand thermometers, and understand percentages; if they get a simple new book on agricultural technology, they can follow the book; if they get a simple new agricultural tool, they can adjust it according to the diagram. In short, the new production organization and the new vision of the future are driving them to accept new things. They themselves also feel that their level of education is not enough to cope with current and future affairs, so in the midst of the hot and busy production, they still participate in cultural studies every morning. They send every one of their school-age children to school. They have sent excellent cadres to the special district to receive training in agricultural technology, accounting, and water conservancy organized by the special district. They send excellent young people to county-level middle schools to study. All of this also demonstrates their determination to move towards socialism.
    This large group of cadres, whether Party members, Youth League members, or the masses, generally has considerable political training and quite noble political qualities. Except for the village government chairman, who receives a small amount of subsidy, they are all unpaid workers who do not leave production (the issue of the cooperative chairman leaving production is only now being considered. Although there are regulations in principle that allow for the recording of work points and dividends for cooperative affairs, some odd jobs cannot be accounted for at all, so there is still a lot of unpaid work). It is not true to say that they have no complaints, but when they are just talking about too much lost work, they immediately receive a notice to go to the county for a meeting, and they can smile and prepare dry food. Let me give a couple of simple examples: If someone goes to the home of cooperative chairman Guo Yu'en to find him, his family often says, "Why come to his house?" as if to say, "Don't you have any common sense! When would he sit at home for a while?" Deputy Party Branch Secretary Guo Dichang has a large family of children, and he is the only one who can participate in agricultural labor. As the autumn harvest was coming to an end, the county asked him to attend a meeting of labor models, a meeting of Party representatives, and a meeting of cooperatives. He attended these meetings for half a month in a row. His wife was waiting for him to come back to discuss buying cloth for the change of seasons, but unexpectedly, he received a notice from the special district asking him to receive water conservancy training (forty days), and he went from the county to the special district without even going home. Village Chief Guo Qiukui was elected by the cooperative after the autumn harvest to be responsible for basic construction, and he said he could not handle it, and he would not do the work assigned to him (leading the building of earthen kilns). After a day, the cooperative was preparing to send someone to persuade him, but on the third day, he started working on his own initiative. People like these, things like these, as long as you live in that village, I guarantee you will encounter them every day. Especially the old cadres, old militiamen (i.e., the militiamen during the War of Resistance Against Japan), and the masses who contributed during the War of Resistance Against Japan, when serving the public, can neither complain nor take credit, and are silent, as if nothing had happened. Some of these people have fought major battles with regular troops, attacked bunkers, and captured prisoners; some have carried stretchers as laborers, following Liu and Deng's troops to the Dabie Mountains for a year. Those heroic deeds all seem ordinary to them, and now it is just attending meetings, doing calculations, setting plans, making summaries, allocating work to military dependents, and assigning meals to visiting cadres... naturally, it feels like an easy task. Naturally, they inevitably have shortcomings, or even many shortcomings, but their awareness is increasing day by day, their shortcomings are decreasing day by day, and the more collective they are, the fewer opportunities there are for backwardness to play a role.
    I am naturally pleased to be able to live with this group of heroes for more than three months. It is a pity that this photograph has not captured all of them.

    一张临别的照片
    赵树理
    去年（一九五二年）秋冬间，我为着了解农业生产合作社，曾到山西平顺县川底村住了三个多月。当时有北京电影制片厂的记录片摄制组在那里摄制片子，还有好多与农村互助合作工作有关的单位的好多同志们在那里协助工作，曾有一度相当热闹。临别时候，农业生产合作社的干部们和我们共同拍了一个像片，作为这一度欢聚的纪念。最近由北京电影制片厂同去的同志把洗制出来的像片给了我一张，我一见之下，觉得不像当日那个场面——其人数之多，几乎像个群众大会；仔细一看，人的面孔都是熟悉的，不但没有增加一个人，还有好多干部没有在场（因为有其他工作没有赶到），只是在拍照时候，面对的是空旷的河滩，而拍到像片上的不过面前的几尺空地，所以觉得人多了。
    “农业生产合作社”这一种新兴的农业生产机构，要作多少事，要用多少人，都是出乎我想像之外的。我先提出几个奇怪的数目字让大家想想看：他们的合作社在去年秋收后扩大到七十六户，而应有的干部岗位就有六十八个，不能兼差的至少要五十一个。这仅仅是合作社的干部，要连党、政、军、团、群众的各种组织机构的干部一同计算起来，恐怕要够一百多个岗位，可是这个村的户数，连远在五里之外的小山庄上的五户计算在内，一共才有九十四户。大家想想这个村、这个社的干部与户数的比例是不是叫你吃惊？
    这个可惊的比例，在川底本村的人看起来是正常的，是缺一不可的——大小缺一个，大小总有一种事没有人办。我们的农村，是我们国家中最广泛的基层组织。麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全。中央有什么机构，在多数的情形下，他们都得有与该部门有关的机构（将来应否调整或缩减、合并，那另是一回事）。既然是一个村，就得有村政府；有一定数量的党、团员，就得有党、团支部；有民兵，就得有武装组织；有群众，就得有群众团体，于是就得有村政府主席、副主席、民事、财粮、建设、文教、卫生、优抗、调解等各委员会，党团支书、支委、小组长，民兵队长、政治主任、组长，妇联主席、组长……缺一不可。他们的农业生产合作社，种着几百亩地，养着几百只羊和几十头耕畜，培养着许多山林和果树，经常要修渠、修坝、修房子、打窑洞……处处有收入，处处有开支。对社内的社员、对社外的供销社、银行、保险公司、兽医、药铺……各有经济往来，如果没有足够的干部分头负责，不但生产效果无法检查，每天该准备多少现款、多少粮食的开支就无法计算，于是就得有社务委员会、监察委员会、正副主席、农业上的正副队长、正副组长，造林、养羊、管理耕畜、经管基本建设、经营副业、做文化教育福利工作，都须有负责的正副主管人，除文教外都得有会计。为了便于检查生产成果，各部门就都得有成本核算制度；为了统一掌握收支情况，就都得定期编造预算。有了这些经济制度，就得有管理这种制度的总机构，于是就得有总财务、总会计、现款保管、粮食保管、农具和其他公物的保管、出纳、采购等人员。这些还只是生产上不可缺少的机构和人员。又因为社会分工赶不上这种新兴的生产组织的需要，就还得成立一些生产以外的补充机构。例如一个八口之家的主妇，每年要把三四十石粗粮作成米面，要做二十多双鞋，十几套衣服，每天要做三顿饭，还得照顾小孩；一个单身人，对这些杂活虽说比较少一点，但是数量可以少，项目却少不了许多（不过没有小孩）。这一些人，要想参加社里的劳动是很困难的。为了解除他们一部分困难，就得开磨房，开食堂，办托儿小组，就又得用人。总之：事是人办的，要办事就得有人。
    有那末多的人吗？新人能办新事，新事也能锻炼新人。他们经过了抗日战争、解放战争、土地改革、镇压反革命以及正在继续进行的支援抗美援朝的人民志愿军，不但锻炼出现有的村级的党、政、军、群各种干部，而且还出去了几十个县、区级干部、人民解放军军官和战士。同样，在生产上，他们也已经从互助合作中锻炼出大致足以胜任的各种干部，把我前边所说的生产中那些麻麻烦烦的任务，也都担当起来了。
    我从前常为他们的文化程度担忧，现在从实际中看来，文化程度不足固然还是个困难，但也不像我估计的那样不济事——他们在技术上，也有少数人可以运用新式簿记，也懂得温度表，也懂得百分比；拿到一本简单的新式农业技术的书，也会照书行事；拿到一种简单的新式农具，也会按图调节。总之，新的生产组织、新的前途观念，推动着他们接受新的事物。他们自己也感到他们的文化程度不够对付现在和将来的事物，因而在火热的生产忙碌中，每天早晨都还要参加文化学习。他们把他们每
    一个学龄子女都送入学校。他们曾派着优秀的干部到专署所在地去受专署主办的农业技术、会计、水利等训练。他们把优秀的青年送到县立中学去学习。这一切也都说明他们向社会主义迈进的决心。
    这个庞大的干部群，不论党、团员或群众，大体上都有相当成熟的政治锻炼和相当高尚的政治品质。他们除了村政府主席有少数的津贴外，全都是不脱离生产的义务职（现在才考虑合作社主席脱离生产问题。在合作社里为社事误了工，原则上虽有可以记工分红的规定，可是有些零碎工根本无法上账，所以仍有许多义务工）。说他们毫无怨言也不近事实，不过当他正说着误工太多的话，马上接到了赴县开会的通知，便能嘻嘻一笑去准备干粮。且让举一两个简单的例子：假如有人到社长郭玉恩家里去找郭玉恩，他家里的人往往说：“怎么来家里找他？”好像是说“你真没有常识！他什么时候会在家里坐一会？”副支部书记郭地长，家里一群孩子，只有他一个人能参加农业劳动。在秋收快结束的时候，县里要他去开劳动模范会、党代表会、合作社会。他一连参加了半个月这些会。他的老婆正等着他回来商量买布换季，不料他接到专署通知要他去受水利训练（四十天），连家也没有回，就从县里往专署去了。村长郭秋魁，在秋收后被社里选他负基本建设总责，他说他兼不了，分配给他的工作（领导打土窑）他不干。隔了一天，社里正准备派专人说服他，可是第三天他便自动地干起来了。像这些人，这些事，只要你住到那村子里，管保你每天都能碰到。特别是老干部、老民兵（即抗日时期的民兵）和在抗日战争时期出过力的群众，在为公众服务时候，都能既不抱怨，也不居功，不言不语，若无其事。这些人，有的随着正规部队打过很大的仗，也攻过碉堡，也捉过俘虏；有的当民工抬担架，跟着刘、邓部队到大别山区走过一年之久。那些英雄事例，在他们都觉着平平常常作过去了，现在只不过开开会、算算账、定定计划、作作总结、给军属拨拨工、给外来干部派派饭……自然觉得是轻而易举的事了。自然他们身上也不免有缺点或者缺点还很多，但他们的觉悟是一天天提高的，缺点是一天天减少的，而且愈集体化，落后面起作用的机会也愈少。
    我能和这一群英雄们共处三个多月，自然是使我满意的事。只可惜这张像片还没有把他们照全。
