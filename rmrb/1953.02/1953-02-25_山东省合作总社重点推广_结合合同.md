Shandong Provincial Cooperative Headquarters convened a meeting of directors of sub-branches in various special districts at the end of April 1952 to study and arrange the pilot promotion of "combined contracts." After the meeting, most counties in various special districts carried out key experiments. According to incomplete statistics from 67 counties, by the end of last November, 168 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives had signed "combined contracts" with 11 agricultural production cooperatives and 1,419 mutual aid teams. Last year, various places gained the following preliminary experiences in the trial implementation of "combined contracts."

    Do a Good Job of Propaganda Work for Signing "Combined Contracts"
    Signing "combined contracts" is a new task, and supply and marketing cooperative cadres generally lack a sufficient understanding of the important political significance of this work. They believe that signing "combined contracts" is asking for trouble and that casual buying and selling is better. On the side of agricultural production cooperative members and mutual aid team members, in addition to the fear of trouble, there are also concerns about suffering losses in prices and not being able to execute the contract in the event of disasters or poor harvests. Therefore, when promoting "combined contracts," it is necessary to first break through the thinking of supply and marketing cooperative cadres, making them realize the great political significance of signing "combined contracts." At the same time, link it with their own business and explain that signing "combined contracts" is very beneficial to the cooperative in realizing planned operations, expanding business, and accelerating capital turnover, so as to overcome the fear of trouble. Then, further carry out patriotic production increase education for agricultural production cooperative members and mutual aid team members, patiently persuade and explain to them, combining their own interests to show that signing "combined contracts" is a powerful guarantee for realizing production increase plans, so that they are happy to accept it. After education, the Ma Mingde mutual aid team in Yin Jialou, Ju County, felt that signing "combined contracts" provided guarantees for production and sales of agricultural and sideline products, so they signed a "combined contract" with the supply and marketing cooperative without any concerns, and revised the production increase plan. The revised production increase plan was 35% to 54% higher than the original plan, and these plans have all been realized last year. Experience has proven that in places where supply and marketing cooperatives have done this, the contracts are more specific and can be realized. On the contrary, if the supply and marketing cooperative does not study this work and the propaganda and education is not specific, the result is empty slogans, and even if a contract is signed, it cannot be executed. Because we do not have much experience in this work, we can only carry out key experiments first, and then gradually promote it. Last April, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative collected materials from Dong Sanjiao Village in Qidong County related to "combined contracts." After research, it sent cadres to Guangrao County for key experiments and provided timely guidance to various counties, which played a great role.

    Firmly Grasp the Principles of Fairness, Reasonableness, Voluntariness, and Mutual Benefit
    Whether it is a mutual aid team, an agricultural production cooperative, or a supply and marketing cooperative, the "combined contract" will be better executed if they correctly estimate their own strength, formulate practical production and supply and marketing plans, and the signed "combined contract" is based on this supply and marketing plan and achieves voluntariness, mutual benefit, specific provisions, and strengthened contact during execution. For example, the "combined contracts" signed by the Lunjiadangmen (village name) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County with the Guanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Wang Zhanyuan Agricultural Mutual Aid Team with the Chengxiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Laiyang County did not encounter any difficulties during execution based on the above principles. On the contrary, "combined contracts" that are signed due to the commandism of leading cadres or the blind support of supply and marketing cooperative cadres cannot be well executed and will cause losses to the supply and marketing cooperative and dissatisfaction among the members. For example, the "combined contract" signed by the Luojiacun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiao County with the Zhang Peixu Agricultural Production Cooperative, under the order of the district cadres, the latter owed the supply and marketing cooperative over 13 million yuan, but only repaid over 3 million yuan last year and will only be able to repay it after the wheat harvest this year, thus seriously affecting the capital turnover of the supply and marketing cooperative. Another example is the director of the Shijiusuo Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rizhao blindly gave 5,600 jin of bean cake on credit to 13 mutual aid teams, five of which were temporarily formed for the sake of getting bean cake on credit. The above situations seriously violate the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, causing undue losses to the supply and marketing cooperative and creating difficulties for signing "combined contracts" in the future.

    Focus on Major Means of Production and Means of Subsistence
        Sign Supply and Marketing Contracts
    Supply and marketing cooperatives must resolutely implement the policy of serving agricultural production and sign contracts with mutual aid teams for the supply of major means of production and means of subsistence and the marketing of agricultural products. In particular, the supply of means of production and means of subsistence must be signed based on possibility, and it is better not to sign if there is no certainty of supply. After the contract is signed, contact and inspection must be strengthened, and the seriousness of the contract must be emphasized to ensure thorough implementation. Experience in various places has proven that most of the clauses of the "combined contracts" signed in this way have been executed, ensuring the realization of the production increase plan of the mutual aid team and consolidating the mutual aid organization. However, some cooperatives, due to lack of experience, have also included some very fragmented commodities in the contract, resulting in waste in operation. For example, the Guanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ju County signed two iron rakes and five leather ropes (very minor tools) with the Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative. In order to execute the contract, the cooperative sent people twice to towns more than 100 li away to purchase them, and the expenses were higher than the cost of the goods. There are also "combined contracts" that are very specific about the items to be supplied, but very general about sales, resulting in the mutual aid team directly selling agricultural and sideline products to the market without going through the supply and marketing cooperative. Therefore, "combined contracts" must make specific provisions in terms of sales. After signing a "combined contract," if it is truly impossible to execute it due to certain unexpected situations during execution, it can be appropriately modified through consultation between the two parties, but neither party should intentionally fail to perform the contract. According to Shandong's experience, the duration of "combined contracts" is currently more appropriate if it does not exceed half a year.

    Combine Signing "Combined Contracts" with Organizational Development
        The members of the mutual aid teams that sign "combined contracts" with the supply and marketing cooperatives are not necessarily all members of the supply and marketing cooperative, but the cooperative treats them the same as members in terms of prices and priorities, and some places even have the phenomenon that non-members who sign "combined contracts" enjoy more preferential treatment than members. For example, the Yanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ju County supplied bean cake to non-supply and marketing cooperative members of agricultural production cooperatives who signed "combined contracts," with 14 pieces per person, while supply and marketing cooperative members who did not sign contracts could only buy two pieces. Supply and marketing cooperative members reflected: "It's better not to join the cooperative, just sign a contract in the future." If the above contradiction is not resolved, it will inevitably hinder the development of the supply and marketing cooperative's own business and organization. In order to solve this contradiction, it is best to absorb non-supply and marketing cooperative members in mutual aid teams and agricultural production into the cooperative on a voluntary basis through signing "combined contracts."

    山东省合作总社重点推广“结合合同”
    于再生
    山东省合作总社在一九五二年四月底召开了各专区分社主任会议，研究布置试办推广“结合合同”问题。会后大部分专区的县都作了重点试验。据六十七个县不完全的统计，到去年十一月底已有一百六十八个基层供销社与十一个农业生产合作社、一千四百十九个互助组订立了“结合合同”。去年各地试行“结合合同”，取得了以下初步经验。
    作好订立“结合合同”的宣传工作
    订立“结合合同”是一个新的工作，供销社的干部对这一工作的重要政治意义一般的是认识不足。认为订“结合合同”是自找麻烦，不如随便买卖好。而在农业生产合作社社员和互助组员方面除有怕麻烦思想外，还有怕在价格上吃亏，怕遇到灾害歉收不能执行合同等思想顾虑。因此，在推广“结合合同”时必须首先打通供销社干部的思想，使他们认识签订“结合合同”的重大政治意义，同时联系本身业务说明订立“结合合同”对合作社实现计划经营、扩大业务、加速资金周转都有很大好处，以克服怕麻烦思想。然后再进一步向农业生产合作社社员和互助组组员进行爱国丰产教育，向他们耐心地说服解释，结合他们本身的利益说明订立“结合合同”是实现增产计划的有力保证，使他们乐于接受。莒县尹家楼马明德互助组经过教育后，感到订立“结合合同”在生产和推销农副产品上有了保证，就毫无顾虑地与供销社签订了“结合合同”，并重新修订了增产计划。修订后的增产计划都较原来的计划提高百分之三十五到百分之五十四，这些计划去年都已全部实现了。经验证明，各地供销社凡是这样做的，合同订立的就比较具体而且能够实现。反之，供销社对这一工作不研究，宣传教育不具体，结果是口头空喊，即便订立亦不能执行。由于我们对这一工作经验不多，只能先进行重点试验，然后逐步推广。山东省社去年四月搜集了栖东县东三叫村有关“结合合同”的材料，经过研究后，派干部到广饶县重点试验，及时指导各县，起了很大作用。切实掌握公平合理、自愿两利的原则
    无论互助组、农业生产合作社或供销社，凡是正确地估计本身力量订出切实可行的生产与供销计划，而所签订的“结合合同”是建筑在这种供销计划基础上、并做到自愿互利、规定具体、且在执行中加强联系，“结合合同”执行的情况就比较好。如莒县伦家当门（村名）农业生产合作社与关庄供销社、莱阳县城厢供销社与王占元农业互助组根据以上原则所订立的“结合合同”，在执行当中都没有发生什么困难。反之，凡是因领导干部强迫命令或供销社干部盲目扶持而订立的“结合合同”，就不能很好地执行，而且会造成供销社的亏损与社员的不满。如胶县罗家村供销社与张培绪农业生产合作社订的“结合合同”，在区干部的命令下，后者赊欠供销社一千三百余万元，去年只还了三百余万元，今年麦收后才能还清，因而严重地影响了供销社的资金周转。又如日照石臼所供销社主任盲目地将五千六百斤豆饼赊给十三个互助组，其中就有五个互助组是为了赊豆饼临时凑起来的。上述情况都严重地违反了自愿两利的原则，使供销社遭受不应有的损失，并给今后订立“结合合同”造成困难。
    抓住主要生产资料和生活资料
    签订供销合同
    供销社必须坚决贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，与互助组签订主要生产资料与生活资料的供应和农产品的推销合同。特别是生产、生活资料的供应，必须根据可能签订，没有把握供应的，宁可不订。在合同签订以后，要加强联系与检查，必须强调合同的严肃性，以保证彻底实现。各地经验证明，凡是这样订了“结合合同”的，绝大部分条款都执行了，而且保证了互助组增产计划的实现，巩固了互助组织。但也有个别社由于缺乏经验，把一些很零碎的商品也订到合同上，以致造成经营上的浪费。如莒县关庄供销社与吕鸿宾农业生产合作社订了两个铁耙、五付皮绳（很次要的工具），合作社为了执行合同，两次派人到一百余里以外的城镇采购，其开支费用比货本还高。还有的“结合合同”关于供应的物品订的很具体，而推销却很笼统，结果互助组就不通过供销社而把农副产品直接拿到市场出卖。因此，“结合合同”必须在推销方面作具体规定。签订“结合合同”以后，在执行当中，由于发生某些意外的情况而确实无法执行时，是可以通过双方协商做适当修改的，但双方绝不应当有意地不履行合同。根据山东的经验，“结合合同”的时间在目前以不超过半年较为适宜。
    签订“结合合同”与发展组织
        相结合
    和供销社签订“结合合同”的互助组，其组内成员并不一定全都是供销社的社员，但是合作社在价格、优先权上也是按社员的待遇一样对他们进行优待，甚至有的地方发生订立“结合合同”的非社员所享受的优待比社员还高的现象。如莒县阎庄供销社对订立“结合合同”的农业生产合作社的非供销社员供应豆饼，每人十四片，未订合同的供销社员却只能买到两片。供销社员反映：“入社还不如不入社好，今后订合同就行了。”上述矛盾如不解决，势必妨碍供销社本身业务和组织的发展。为了解决这一矛盾，最好是通过订立“结合合同”把互助组和农业生产中的非供销社员在自愿的原则下吸收到社内来。
