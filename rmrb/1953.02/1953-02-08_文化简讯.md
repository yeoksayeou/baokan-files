Northwest Three Colleges Hold Russian Intensive Tutor Training Class

The teachers in Northwest region's universities, after ideological remolding, have improved their political awareness and are eager to learn advanced Soviet scientific theories and teaching experiences. In early December 1952, the Northwest Education Department convened a forum of responsible persons from various colleges and universities to discuss how to systematically and step-by-step carry out intensive Russian reading, and decided to select Northwest Institute of Technology, Northwest Agricultural College, and Northwest Medical College to conduct key pilot programs during the winter vacation.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of the intensive Russian learning, Northwest Institute of Technology and the other two colleges successively held Russian intensive tutor training classes or training sessions between December last year and January this year. The students participating in the study generally had a very shallow level of Russian, and some only knew the letters. At the beginning of the study, they encountered many difficulties, and individual students even doubted the intensive Russian learning. However, after a period of study, these difficulties were quickly overcome, and their confidence in learning was also improved. After more than 20 days of intense study, they gained a lot. For example, after the Russian intensive tutor training class at Northwest Institute of Technology ended, all students were able to master the basic grammar used in all engineering books, memorize at least 1,200 new words (the most being nearly 2,000), and generally read 20 to 30 lines of Russian professional books per hour, with the fastest reaching 56 lines. At Northwest Medical College, 90% of the students memorized 1,900 new words.

Solar Eclipse Time on February 14th
Central People's Broadcasting Station to Broadcast Explanation and Observation of Solar Eclipse

In order to popularize scientific knowledge and help people across the country observe the solar eclipse phenomenon, the China Association for Science and Technology and the Central People's Broadcasting Station have decided to jointly organize a broadcast program on observing the solar eclipse from 7:00 to 9:35 in the morning on February 14th. The program will be explained by China's famous astronomers Zhang Yuzhe and Dai Wensai. Starting from the beginning of the partial eclipse, a detailed explanation will be given according to the entire process of the solar eclipse. People's Broadcasting Stations in the Northeast and East China regions, as well as some People's Broadcasting Stations in the North China and Central South regions, will broadcast simultaneously. The wavelengths of the Central People's Broadcasting Station are: 640 kHz, 9040 kHz, 6100 kHz, 10260 kHz, 7500 kHz, and 15170 kHz.

Jinan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Holds Amateur Arts Training Classes

The Jinan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has established three amateur arts training classes in the city's second, fourth, and fifth districts, absorbing workers and street activists to participate in learning. Each training class has already started on January 15th. There are a total of 1,030 students, including 554 workers (including shop assistants), 463 street residents, and 13 cadres from government offices. Each training class has three subjects: drama, music, and dance, taught by cadres from the Cultural Center. The requirement of the amateur arts training class is to enable students to understand the relationship between art and politics through this study, and to enable students to initially grasp the basic knowledge of music, dance, drama, and other recreational activities. In terms of teaching methods, the method of combining learning and doing is adopted. The training of these students will play a significant role in the city's 1953 Spring Festival recreational activities and the development of long-term recreational activities.

Northeast Holds First Ice Sports Games

The first Northeast Ice Sports Games was held on February 1st at the People's Stadium in Harbin. 315 athletes from twelve provinces and cities in Northeast China participated in the Games. These athletes included not only students, staff, and engineers, but also miners, construction workers, farmers, shop assistants, and peddlers.

    西北三学院举办俄文速成辅导员训练班
    西北区高等学校的教师们，经过思想改造，政治觉悟提高了，迫切要求学习苏联先进科学理论和教学经验。一九五二年十二月上旬，西北教育部为了有计划有步骤地开展俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习，曾召集各院校负责人举行座谈，决定寒假期间选定西北工学院、西北农学院、西北医学院三学院进行重点试办。
    为了保证俄文速成学习顺利完成，西北工学院等三学院于去年十二月和今年一月间，先后举办了俄文速成辅导员学习班或训练班。参加学习的学员，一般的俄文程度很浅，有的只是刚会字母。在学习开始时，他们遇到不少困难，个别学员甚至对俄文速成发生怀疑。但经过一个时期的学习过程，这些困难都很快得到了克服，学习信心也提高了。经过二十多天的紧张学习，收获很大。如西北工学院俄文速成辅导员训练班结束后，全体学员都能很好地掌握全部工程书籍中所用的基本语法，最少记会了一千二百以上的生字（最多的近两千），一般地每小时能阅读俄文专业书二十到三十行，最快的达五十六行。西北医学院记会一千九百个生字的达百分之九十。
