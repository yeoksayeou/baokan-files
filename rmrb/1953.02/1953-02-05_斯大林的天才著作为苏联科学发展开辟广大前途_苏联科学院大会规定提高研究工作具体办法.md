Academician O. Schmidt, the founder of the new cosmogony, spoke in his speech about the prospects for further research into the origin and evolution of the Earth and other planets. He pointed out that many astronomers, geologists, physicists, and scientists in other fields are now studying these important issues. In addition, speeches were also made by Academician K.
