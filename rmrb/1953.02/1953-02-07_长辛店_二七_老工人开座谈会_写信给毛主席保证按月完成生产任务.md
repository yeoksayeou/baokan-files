    [Report from This Newspaper] The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory jointly formed a condolence group, carrying rice, flour, meat, and other items on January 31st to express sympathy to the families of "February 7th" martyrs such as Wu Zhen. They also convened a symposium with over one hundred veteran workers from the "February 7th" strike. At the meeting, the veteran workers recalled the heroic deeds of the "February 7th" martyrs. After comparing the political status of the working class before and after liberation, they all expressed their determination to improve production and strive to complete this year's three major tasks. Worker He Fengting, after recounting his life before liberation, said, "Now that we are masters of our own house, we must build our country well." Many veteran workers, recounting the scenes of their happy life after liberation, expressed their determination to pass on their skills to young workers, learn advanced experiences, and better build the great motherland. "February 7th" veteran worker and labor model En Peining said, "Chairman Mao has brought us good times. We should nurture our next generation well so that they can better serve the country's large-scale economic construction." Labor model Zuo Shijun said, "My past experience is becoming outdated. I should learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the youth, and strive to improve my skills." Finally, the veteran workers jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, putting forward four guarantees: First, to respond to all calls from the Communist Party and the People's Government and strive to complete the great task of national economic construction; Second, to pass on all production techniques and work experience to young workers; Third, to do a good job in inspection work, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and promote advanced work methods; Fourth, to help and unite all employees, bring into play everyone's strength, and complete and exceed the production tasks on a monthly basis.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th -- The "February 7th" Memorial Hall jointly built by the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Zhengzhou District Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union has been completed. The hall is located on the old site of the Pule Theater on Qiantang Road in Zhengzhou, which is where the inaugural meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Federation of Trade Unions was held on February 1, 1923. The "February 7th" Memorial Hall has three parts: a "February 7th" Historical Relics Exhibition Room, a film department, and a club (including game rooms, a library, and an open-air dance floor). In the center of the "February 7th" Historical Relics Exhibition Room hangs an inscription personally written by Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern Administrative Council: "The Great Working Class, Heroic Revolutionary Struggle." The room displays many historical relics of the "February 7th" struggle. There are membership badges of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Federation of Trade Unions and the Shijiazhuang Trade Union of the Zhengtai Railway from the time of the "February 7th" strike, propaganda posters made by the trade union organizations at the time after the "February 7th" massacre, and the "Lament for the 'February 7th' Martyrs" song. There are also the posthumous photos of martyr Shi Yang and others who sacrificed, and a part of the book "'February 7th' Workers' Grievances," which contains the trade union's investigation into worker casualties during the "February 7th" strike. In addition, there are also serialized cartoons created by literary and art workers of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau based on the memories of veteran "February 7th" workers, titled "History of the 'February 7th' Struggle of Chinese Railway Workers," and photos of the public trial and execution after liberation of Zhao Jixian, the pseudo-Beijing-Hankou Railway Administration Director and perpetrator of the "February 7th" massacre.
