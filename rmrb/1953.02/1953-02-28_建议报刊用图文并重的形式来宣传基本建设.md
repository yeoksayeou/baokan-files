    Suggest Newspapers and Periodicals Use a Combination of Pictures and Text to Promote Basic Construction
    Letter from Tang Jian: 1953 is the first year our country has entered large-scale economic construction. Great basic construction projects will be built one by one throughout the country. This is the great happy event that our people have been dreaming of for a hundred years. Faced with such new construction and new atmosphere, how excited and joyous we are! Every day, we eagerly look through various newspapers and magazines, hoping to get good news about various new projects and new achievements from them. But unfortunately, there are not many reports on this aspect in newspapers and magazines, and there are very few vivid and moving news and stories. I would like to make a request to newspapers and magazines: I hope they will strengthen the reporting in this area and bravely meet this unprecedented historical transformation from the propaganda front. I think the best way to report is to use reportage in conjunction with pictures and photos. The "Steel Capital Construction Site" column specially opened by China Youth Daily uses a combination of pictures and texts to report on various construction projects in Anshan, workers' lives, and the stories of Soviet experts. This can attract the people to pay close attention to this great project being carried out in our country and encourage everyone to participate in various national construction projects with greater enthusiasm. Therefore, I suggest that newspapers and magazines pay attention to adopting such propaganda methods.

    建议报刊用图文并重的
    形式来宣传基本建设
    汤健来信：一九五三年是我们国家进入大规模经济建设的第一年，伟大的基本建设工程将一个一个地在全国各地兴建起来，这是我们全国人民百年以来梦寐以求的大喜事。面对着这样的新建设新气象，我们是多么振奋和欢欣啊！每天我们也以迫切期待的心情，翻阅着各种报纸和杂志，想从这里面得到各个新工程新成就的好消息。但很可惜，报纸杂志上关于这方面的报道却不多，生动感人的消息、故事更是寥寥无几。我向报纸杂志提出一个要求：希望他们加强这方面的报道，从宣传战线上勇敢地来迎接这个空前的历史转变。我认为报道最好多采用报告文学的体裁并配上图画照片。中国青年报特辟的“钢都工地”栏，用图文并重的形式报道鞍山的各种建设、工人生活、苏联专家的故事，这就能吸引人民群众息息相关地注视着我们国家进行的这一伟大工程，鼓舞大家更加热情奋发地参加国家的各项建设。因此，我建议报纸杂志都注意采取这样的宣传方法。
