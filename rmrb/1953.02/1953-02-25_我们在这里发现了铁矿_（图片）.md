    “We Have Discovered an Iron Mine Here”
    To meet the needs of the country’s large-scale construction and to explore the rich underground resources of the motherland, tens of thousands of people searching for underground treasures are working with full confidence in the deep mountains and wilderness. The No. 429 Team of the Central Geological Department is a strong exploration team composed of thousands of people, including experts and technicians in geology, surveying, drilling, and geophysical prospecting, and is attached to a laboratory, a repair shop, and a training class for drilling personnel. They are conducting "iron" prospecting work in a barren, mountainous area in the south-central part of the motherland.
    Geological exploration personnel of the exploration team are preparing to enter the tunnels to find the boundaries of the ore bodies in order to more accurately determine the area of the deposit.
    Before the start of a day's work, the captain of the geophysical prospecting team instructed everyone when arranging the work: "Today we must pay special attention to the extension of the ore body to both sides."
    Geophysical prospectors are using magnetic detailed survey work on the vast fields to find mineral deposits.
    In order to solve the problem of water shortage in the highlands, which prevents the drilling rig from working, the drilling personnel are installing a water pump to prepare to transport water to the highlands.
    The laboratory staff adopted advanced assembly line operation methods to conduct timely analysis and testing of the ore at the construction site.
    A new type of drilling rig that can drill to a depth of 500 meters is taking core samples, which will be sent to the laboratory to determine the content and grade of the deposit.
    "We have discovered an iron mine here." One day, at the end of work, the deputy leader of the geological exploration team said happily, pointing to the geological map.
    Geological exploration and drilling personnel are discussing and studying geological profile maps of mineral deposits at the drilling rig site.
    During breaks, the high mountains and deep valleys become the place where team members sing and dance. (The photos in this issue of the pictorial are taken by Peng Huashi of the People's Pictorial)

    “我们在这里发现了铁矿”
    为了适应国家大规模建设的需要，发掘祖国丰富的地下资源，成千成万找寻地下宝藏的人们，正满怀信心地在深山旷野中工作着。中央地质部第四二九队是一支由数千人组成的强大勘探队，其中包括地质、测量、钻探和物理探矿等各方面的专家和技术人员，并附设化验室、修理厂和一个钻探人员训练班。他们正在祖国中南部一个荒芜的多山地区进行着“铁”的探测工作。
    勘探队的地质勘探人员准备进入坑道，找寻矿体的界线，以便更精确地来测定矿藏的面积。
    在一天的工作开始前，物理探矿队队长在布置工作时叮嘱大家说：“今天我们要特别注意勘探矿体向两边伸延的情形。”
    物理探矿人员正在广阔的田野上，利用磁力详测工作来找寻矿藏。
    为了解决高地缺水，钻机无法工作的困难，钻探人员正在安装抽水机，准备把水输送到高地上去。
    化验室工作人员采用了先进的流水作业操作法，在工地及时地进行了矿石的分析化验工作。
    可以钻深五百公尺的新式钻机在采取岩心，准备送到化验室去测定矿藏的含量和品位。
    “我们在这里发现了铁矿。”一天，在工作完了时，地质勘探队的分队长高兴地指着地质图这样说。
    地质勘探和钻探人员，正在钻机工地讨论、研究矿藏地质剖面图。
    休息时，高山深谷变成了队员们歌舞的场所。（本期画刊照片为人民画报彭华士摄）
