Local People's Governments Should Seriously Investigate How Cases of People Reporting Counter-Revolutionaries Have Been Handled
——Reader Letters and Commentary

    Recently, our newspaper has received many letters from readers in various places reflecting that they have reported some escaped counter-revolutionaries to the local people's governments, but have not received due processing. These letters reflect that some cadres in our government organs still have serious complacency and bureaucratic work styles. They are not vigilant or resentful towards counter-revolutionaries, and they do not value or support the people's righteous actions in reporting counter-revolutionaries. This situation will allow some escaped counter-revolutionaries to continue to evade justice and carry out sabotage activities, which is extremely harmful to national construction and the interests of the people. Therefore, we must pay serious attention to this.

    A reader from the Affiliated Worker-Peasant Quick-Completion Middle School of the People's University wrote in a letter: In April 1951, she reported to the People's Government of Jiang County, Shanxi Province, a counter-revolutionary who had served as a puppet county chief and murdered many revolutionary cadres, requesting the Jiang County People's Government to immediately punish him. However, the Jiang County People's Government only gave her a reply half a year later, saying that this counter-revolutionary did not admit his guilt, so it was difficult to convict him. Afterwards, the reader sent several more letters to the Jiang County People's Government, continuing to provide materials and requesting the punishment of this counter-revolutionary, but the Jiang County People's Government always ignored her. A comrade from the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region wrote in a letter: In July 1951, he reported a counter-revolutionary to the Public Security Bureau of Daxing County, Hebei Province. Because this counter-revolutionary had also committed crimes in Ding County, the bureau asked the Public Security Bureau of the Ding County People's Government to assist in the investigation. The Ding County Public Security Bureau never replied, and the Daxing County Public Security Bureau did not follow up, so the case was put on hold and never resolved. Another reader even exposed an intolerable fact: the masses in the Fifth District of Lingbao County, Henan Province, captured a counter-revolutionary with numerous blood debts and sent him to the District People's Government. However, the district cadres neither interrogated him seriously nor ordered anyone to keep him under strict guard, and all went to watch a play, as a result, the counter-revolutionary took the opportunity to escape. It should be pointed out that the above-mentioned cadres' erroneous practices are a criminal act against the people. Some of them regard the important work of investigating the counter-revolutionary's criminal activities as unimportant and ignore it for a long time; some do not investigate the counter-revolutionary's criminal acts from the masses, trusting the counter-revolutionary more than they trust the masses; some regard watching a play as more important than punishing counter-revolutionaries, and in order to watch a play, they can fail to guard counter-revolutionary criminals. They have no hatred for counter-revolutionaries and are so indifferent to the interests of the people. Obviously, being merciful to counter-revolutionaries is being cruel to the people. Their erroneous behavior not only seriously undermines the enthusiasm of the masses in caring about national interests and reporting counter-revolutionaries, but also allows many counter-revolutionaries to evade justice. If these counter-revolutionaries are not punished in time, they will continue to carry out sabotage activities, threatening and harming the country's construction cause and the people's happy life.

    Another serious situation that should be pointed out is that a small number of government cadres have lost their positions and shielded counter-revolutionaries, which has also hindered the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, a township head in Quxia District, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, introduced several counter-revolutionaries to work after liberation, and in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, he helped these counter-revolutionaries to conceal their crimes. A township cadre in the Fourth District of Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, when the County Public Security Bureau went to arrest a counter-revolutionary, actually informed the counter-revolutionary, allowing him to escape.

    This serious situation must not be allowed to continue! We believe that party organizations and people's governments in various places should strengthen education on suppressing counter-revolutionaries for cadres, so that every cadre deeply recognizes that although we have made great achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the Kuomintang remnant bandits and imperialists are still continuing to direct counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities; fighting against counter-revolutionaries is a long-term and arduous task. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the national construction cause, we must oppose the complacency of losing vigilance against counter-revolutionaries and the bureaucratic work style of neglecting the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and we must resolutely and severely suppress counter-revolutionaries. For the counter-revolutionary cases reported by the people in the past, the people's governments in various places should quickly and seriously handle them so that these counter-revolutionaries can be brought to justice; and those cadres who have handled these cases with a bureaucratic attitude in the past should be given due criticism and handling. As for individual degenerates who have lost their positions and shielded counter-revolutionaries in violation of laws and regulations, struggles against violations of laws and regulations should be launched through rural party rectification and democratic political construction to conduct serious handling, so as to strengthen grassroots political power and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 各地人民政府应该认真检查怎样处理了人民检举反革命的案件——读者来信述评

    各地人民政府应该认真检查怎样处理了人民检举反革命的案件
    ——读者来信述评
    近来本报接到各地很多读者来信反映：他们向当地人民政府检举了一些漏网的反革命分子，但却得不到应有的处理。这些来信，反映出我们政府机关的某些干部还有着严重的麻痹思想和官僚主义作风。他们对反革命分子不警惕、不痛恨，对人民检举反革命分子的正义行动不重视、不支持。这种情况，将使一些漏网的反革命分子继续逍遥法外，进行破坏活动，对国家建设和人民利益是极端有害的。因此，必须引起我们严重的注意。
    中国人民大学附设工农速成中学一位读者来信说：她在一九五一年四月曾向山西绛县人民政府检举了一个当过伪县长、杀害过不少革命干部的反革命分子，要求绛县人民政府立即惩办，而绛县人民政府在半年以后才给她一个回信，说是这个反革命分子不承认自己有罪恶，因此不好办罪。以后这个读者又曾多次给绛县人民政府去信，继续供给材料，并要求惩办这个反革命分子，而绛县人民政府始终置之不理。华北军区后勤部一位同志来信说：他在一九五一年七月曾向河北大兴县人民政府公安局检举了一个反革命分子。因为这个反革命分子在定县也有过罪恶活动，该局就请定县人民政府公安局协助调查。定县公安局一直不答复，大兴县公安局也没有催办，这个案件就高高挂起，一直没有下文了。还有一位读者更揭发了一件使人不能容忍的事实：河南省灵宝县五区群众将一个血债累累的反革命分子抓住后送到区人民政府。但区干部既未认真审讯，也不叫人严加看押，就都去看戏，结果让反革命分子乘机跑掉了。应该指出：以上这些干部的错误做法，是对人民的一种犯罪行为。他们有的把调查反革命分子罪恶活动的重要工作看作无关紧要的事，长期置之不理；有的不向群众调查反革命分子的罪恶行为，相信反革命分子甚于相信群众；有的把看戏看作比惩办反革命分子更为重要，为了要看戏而可以不看押反革命罪犯。他们对反革命分子没有一点痛恨，对人民群众的利益这样漠不关心。很明显，对反革命分子的仁慈就是对人民的残忍。他们这种错误行为不但严重地打击了人民群众关心国家利益、检举反革命分子的积极性；而且更使不少反革命分子逍遥法外。这些反革命分子如不及时惩办，就会继续进行破坏活动，使国家的建设事业和人民的幸福生活受到威胁、损害。
    还应该指出的一个严重情况是：少数政府干部丧失立场，包庇反革命分子，也使镇压反革命的工作受到阻碍。如江苏省泰兴县曲霞区一个乡长，在解放后竟介绍了好几个反革命分子参加工作，在镇压反革命运动中，他又帮助这些反革命分子隐瞒罪恶。山东沂源县四区一个乡干部，当县公安局去逮捕一个反革命分子时，竟给反革命分子报信，让他逃跑。
    决不能允许这种严重情况再继续存在了！我们认为：各地党的组织和人民政府应该对干部加强有关镇压反革命的教育，使每一个干部深刻认识：虽然我们在镇压反革命工作上已经取得了很大的成就，但是国民党残余匪帮和帝国主义者还在继续指使反革命分子进行破坏活动；和反革命分子作斗争是一个长期而艰巨的工作。为了使国家建设事业能够顺利进行，就必须反对对反革命分子失去警惕的麻痹思想和忽视镇压反革命工作的官僚主义作风，就必须坚决、严厉地来镇压反革命分子。对于过去人民检举的反革命案件，各地人民政府都应该迅速认真地加以处理，使这些反革命分子都能归案法办；并给那些过去以官僚主义态度来处理这些案件的干部以应有的批评和处理。至于个别蜕化变质，丧失立场，包庇反革命分子的违法乱纪分子，应该通过农村整党和民主建政等工作，开展反对违法乱纪的斗争，进行严肃处理，以加强基层政权，巩固人民民主专政。
