    I Received a Profound Education During the Inspection of Design Projects
    Luan Quanxun, Engineer of Tianjin Architectural Design Company

    In late December of last year, our company launched a major inspection of design projects from 1952. This inspection gave me a profound education. Many vivid facts were presented to me, all showing that many of the mistakes and shortcomings in past design projects were mainly due to my own backward and conservative design viewpoints. This engineering inspection educated all the design personnel in our company.

    Initially, I did not fully recognize the significance of this engineering inspection. I still thought that the many erroneous facts in design work cited by the leading comrades during the mobilization were just "isolated cases." At that time, our group was assigned to inspect two projects: the Baijiu Distillery Project of the Monopoly Enterprise Company and the Ziya River Flour Mill Project. The Baijiu Distillery Project was designed by the design company in July 1952, and I also participated in this design. I thought: at that time, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements had just ended, everyone criticized the old viewpoints, and the Baijiu Distillery project design should not have major problems. But on the other hand, I also thought, in the past, design personnel did not go to the construction site, this time going to the construction site for a run could also learn some technology. So, we set off to inspect.

    After we arrived at the project site, everything was the opposite of what we thought. When our inspection team stepped into the construction site of the Baijiu Distillery, we saw that the base of the factory was very large (the building area only accounted for 22% of the base), but the buildings were crowded together, the transportation routes were narrow, and the four corners of the base were very empty, which made people feel very uncomfortable. Then we discovered that the flammable wine storage was very close to the winery, the starter culture room, and the office building. Its location was in the center of each building, and we further felt that the overall layout had major problems. After entering, the owner told us many serious design errors: the temperature in the winery was very high, and the workers wore shorts even in the winter of minus 30 degrees Celsius and were covered in sweat, but the designers did not design a bathroom and locker room inside the building. The north-facing door did not block the wind, and the north wind poured straight in. The toilet was 50 meters away from the factory building, and workers had to put on all their clothes to go out to urinate.

    When we arrived at the flour mill, there were even more problems with the flour mill's design. The building experienced uneven settlement because the site was not surveyed during the design, and the machines were also crooked. At this time, I realized that the problem was not small and not much, but the problem was big and a lot. At this time, other groups also found many problems in the field inspection, and everyone was very shocked. Moreover, a series of problems all showed that the cause of these serious errors and shortcomings was not that our technology was insufficient, but that our designers did not have a clear view of who to serve, but that we had backward and conservative design ideas. After summarizing the problems in the group after returning from the construction site inspection, I further clarified this problem. Very heavy and very ashamed.

    During this inspection, I mainly criticized the following three issues in my thinking:

    First, the issue of incorrect design viewpoints. In the past, when we designed hotels, we strived to design them so that passengers would feel comfortable, convenient, and quickly recover from fatigue. When designing private villas, we were even more considerate of the owner. But when we designed factories, we forgot the owner of the factory – the workers. Judging from the several projects inspected this time, the designer did not consider the safety, hygiene, and health care of the workers at all. Is this kind of "forgetting" accidental? Where has our viewpoint of serving the working class gone? Another aspect of this incorrect design view is that we used to pay the least attention to factory and warehouse projects in the design, simply thinking that "that's nothing, it doesn't leak rain, and it can hold the machines." These "simple" design projects were not where "heroes" could use their skills. Only when designing auditoriums, hospitals, large buildings, and other large buildings, was it worth showing off. This extremely irresponsible individualistic design idea towards national basic construction is the root cause of many major errors. In fact, this inspection shows that designing factories and warehouses is not "simple" at all, but is a very complicated task, and I must learn hard from the beginning.

    Secondly, the issue of incorrect design standpoints. This mainly refers to the correct relationship with the owner. In the old society, engineers sold technology. They designed for the owner and obtained remuneration from the other party. Therefore, there was no real idea of being responsible to the owner to the end. However, now we are designing national factories, schools, and hospitals. The so-called owner is no longer the capitalist of the past, but all the people. Therefore, our relationship with the owner has completely changed. However, I did not realize this. I still treated this new relationship with old views and attitudes. In my work, I often did not adopt the same attitude of being responsible for the national construction cause as the owner. I often said: "You are the owner, I will design according to what you say, anyway, if I am wrong, I can say that you wanted me to do it this way." "If you want to get the drawings out early, I will draw them for you hastily, and it is your fault for urging the drawings if you are not thoughtful." This wrong attitude has caused many errors in the work. For example, when designing the Baijiu Distillery project, I proposed to connect the five factory buildings together, which can save wall space, base area, and equipment ditches and pipes, etc., but the factory was afraid that the ventilation would not be good and the temperature would be too high. In fact, these problems can be solved, but I no longer explained. I thought, "If you want this, then that's fine." This engineering inspection proves that connecting the five factory buildings at that time was the right thing to do. Now the Baijiu Distillery needs to add bathrooms, locker rooms, and other equipment, but the factory buildings are separated, so they have to be built in each factory building, causing a lot of waste. Another aspect of this incorrect relationship is that sometimes we are unable to listen to the opinions of the factory and the opinions of the masses, but we make our own decisions and design subjectively, and as a result, we cannot meet the needs of production. There are also many examples in this regard. In short, not having a clear view of who the design is for and wrong ideas and work attitudes are the root causes of many past mistakes.

    Thirdly, the issue of unscientific work attitudes. Architectural engineering is a very complex science and must be very cautious and careful. However, in my design, I replaced seeking truth from facts with subjectivism and replaced sloppiness with in-depth investigation and research. I did a very poor job in the investigation and research work at the beginning of the project. The losses suffered in this regard in the design project are incalculable. For example, some overall layouts were designed subjectively while sitting at home during the design. When the construction was completed or used, problems arose. Especially some "small" tasks in the design (in fact, these "small" tasks often cause big losses), such as glass area, rainwater pipes, etc., I never calculated precisely, and just drew them casually. Only in places that can show my design ability (such as large buildings, etc.) did I use my brains a little. When designing the Baijiu Distillery, I vaguely knew that it was necessary to drain water, but I did not understand the relevant situation such as the sewer in detail, so I did not design drainage equipment. Now the Baijiu Distillery is about to start construction, but the problem of discharging 30,000 gallons of water a day has not been solved. When designing the chimney of the Baijiu Distillery, I carelessly determined the location on the drawing without investigating the terrain on the spot. Later, during construction, it was discovered that according to this location, the guy wire (steel wire) for pulling the chimney had to be pulled all the way to the road. Cars and horses could not pass on the road, but now the chimney has been completed and cannot be replaced, so we had to re-customize the thick guy wire and reduce the pulling slope, which seriously affected the progress of the construction.

    The above is just a rough inspection of a few major erroneous viewpoints in my design work. In short, my love and sense of responsibility for the motherland's construction cause is very insufficient. Through this engineering inspection, I have found my shortcomings. I am determined to transform myself, engage in my work with a new labor attitude, learn from the advanced experience of Soviet design work, and contribute all my strength to the motherland's large-scale construction.

    在设计工程的检查中我受到了深刻的教育
    天津建筑设计公司工程师　栾全训
    去年十二月下旬，我们公司展开了一次一九五二年设计工程的大检查。这次检查使我受到了一次深刻的教育，许多活生生的事实摆在我的面前，都说明过去设计工程中许多的错误和缺点，主要是由于自己落后保守的设计观点所造成。这次工程检查，我们公司全体设计人员都得到了一次教育。
    最初，我对这次工程检查的意义还认识不足。领导同志在动员时举出的许多设计工作中的错误事实，我还认为这不过是“个别情况”。当时我们小组分配的检查工程有二个：专卖事业公司白酒厂工程和子牙河面粉厂工程。白酒厂工程是一九五二年七月由设计公司设计的，我也曾参加了这个设计。我想：那时“三反”“五反”运动才结束，大家都批判了旧观点，白酒厂工程设计一定不会有多大问题。但另外我也想，过去设计人员不到工地去，这次到工地去跑一跑，多少也可以学到一些技术。这样，我们就出发去检查了。
    我们到了工程地点以后，一切情况与我们想的恰恰相反，当我们的检查小组踏进了白酒厂的工地时，看到厂址基地很大（建筑面积仅占基地的百分之二十二），但建筑物却挤在一起，运输道很狭，而基地的四角上却空得很，看了使人很不舒服。接着我们又发现易燃的酒库离制酒厂、粬房、办公楼各建筑物都很近，它位置在各建筑物的中心，便进一步感到总平面布局有很大的问题。进去后，业主又告诉了我们许多设计上的严重错误：制酒厂内温度很高，工人同志就是在摄氏零下三十度的冬天也穿短裤工作，还满身是汗，但是设计人员却没有在屋里设计一间洗澡间和更衣室。朝北的大门没有挡风，北风直朝里灌。厕所离厂房最远的有五十公尺，工人得穿上全部衣服才能出去小便。
    我们到了面粉厂，面粉厂设计上的问题更多，大楼因设计时未勘测而发生了不平均的沉陷，机器也歪了。这时候我才警觉到，不是问题不大不多，而是问题很大很多。这时其他小组在实地检查中也发现了许多问题，大家都十分震动。而且一连串的问题都说明了：造成这些严重错误和缺点，完全不是我们的技术不够，而是我们设计工作者没有明确为谁服务的观点问题，而是我们落后保守的设计思想问题。在工地检查回来，小组进行了总结以后，我更进一步明确了这个问题。很沉痛，也很惭愧。
    这次检查，我思想上主要批判了下面三个问题：
    首先是不正确的设计观点问题。过去我们设计旅馆时，力求设计得如何使旅客感到舒服，方便，迅速恢复疲劳。设计私人公馆，更是替主人考虑得十分周到。但就是在设计工厂的时候，我们却忘记了工厂的主人——工人。从这次检查的几个工程来看，设计者是完全没有考虑到工人的安全、卫生、保健等问题的，这样的“忘记”难道是偶然的么？我们为工人阶级服务的观点到那里去了呢？这种不正确的设计观点的另一方面，是我们过去在设计中最不重视厂房仓库的工程，简单地认为“那没有啥，不漏雨，能摆下机器就行了。”这些“简单”的设计工程不是“英雄”用武之地，设计礼堂、医院、大楼等大建筑物时，才值得好好露一手。这种对国家基本建设极端不负责任的个人主义的设计思想，就是造成许多重大错误的根源。其实这次的检查说明：设计厂房、仓库丝毫也不“简单”，都是十分复杂的工作，自己还必须从头好好地学习。
    其次是不正确的设计立场问题。这主要是指与业主的正确关系问题。旧社会里工程师出卖技术，他给业主设计，从对方取得报酬，因此是没有真正的对业主负责到底的思想的。但是，现在我们设计的是国家的工厂、学校、医院，所谓业主，已经不是过去的资本家，而是全体人民，因此我们与业主的这种关系是已经完全改变了。可是，我却没有认识到这一点，我还以旧的看法和态度，来对待这新的关系，在工作中我往往不是采取与业主同样的对国家建设事业负责的态度，我常常说：“你是业主，你讲什么我就照着设计，反正错了我可以说是你要这样做的。”“你要早出图，我就草草地给你画，考虑不周密是你催图催的。”这种错误态度，在工作中造成了许多错误，例如在设计白酒厂工程时，我曾提出把五幢厂房连在一起，这样可以节省墙身、基地面积和设备的沟管等，但厂方怕这样通风不好，温度太高，其实这些问题都是可以解决的，可是我就不再进行解释，心想“你要这样就这样好了”。经过这次工程检查证明：当时把五幢厂房连起来的做法是正确的，现在白酒厂要添设浴室、更衣室等设备，但厂房分开了，这样不得不在每个厂房都建筑一个，造成很大的浪费。这种不正确关系的另一方面，是我们有时又表现为不能很好地听取厂方的意见，听取群众的意见，而是自作主张，主观设计，结果不能适合生产的需要。这方面的例子也很多。总之，没有明确设计为谁服务的观点以及错误的思想和工作态度，是过去许多错误发生的根源。
    第三是不科学的工作态度问题。建筑工程本是一项很复杂的科学，必须十分谨慎小心，但是我在设计中却以主观主义来代替实事求是，以潦草马虎来代替深入调查研究。我在工程开始时调查研究工作做得很差，这方面在设计工程上遭到的损失是不可估计的，如有些总平面布置，设计时坐在家里主观设计，当施完工或使用起来时，问题都来了。特别是设计中的一些“细小”工作，（其实这种“细小”工作往往就造成大损失）如玻璃面积、雨水管等我从不精密计算，随便一划就算，只有能够显示自己设计能力的地方（例如大楼等），自己才动点脑筋。在设计白酒厂时，只含糊知道要排水，而没有详细了解下水道等有关情况，结果就未设计排水设备。现在白酒厂就要开工了，但一天三万加仑水的排泄问题仍未解决。在设计白酒厂的烟囱时，我马虎地在图上定了位置，没有实地调查地形，后来施工时才发现按照这个地位，拉烟囱的?线（钢丝）要一直拉到马路上才行，路上车马都不能走了，但现在烟囱已做好不能换地方了，只好重新定制粗?线，把拉的斜度缩小，严重影响了施工的进行。
    以上只是我在设计工作中的几个主要错误观点的粗略检查。总之，我对祖国建设事业的热爱和责任感是十分不够的，通过这次工程检查，我找到了自己的缺点，我决心改造自己，以新的劳动态度来从事我的工作，学习苏联设计工作的先进经验，为祖国的大规模建设贡献出我全部力量。
