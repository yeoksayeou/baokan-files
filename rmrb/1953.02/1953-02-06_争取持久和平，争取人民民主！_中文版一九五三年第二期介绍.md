The second issue, 1953, Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!," the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue focuses on national independence and liberation, featuring an editorial entitled "The National Liberation Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries is Rising." The editorial discusses the development of national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and the Near and Middle East, pointing out that the most important factors contributing to this development are the world-historic victory of the Soviet Union in the Second World War, which led to the defeat of fascist Germany and militarist Japan, the rise of the people's democracies, and the weakening of world imperialism. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have further revolutionized the East and promoted the continued development of the great liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples. The editorial states: The national liberation struggles in colonies and dependent countries are becoming more active and resolute. In various countries, the spontaneous and scattered movements for independence are now becoming more organized, and the struggles are taking on a national character. Neither the terror policies of the colonizers nor the treasonous acts of the right-wing socialist leaders directly commanded by U.S. imperialism can destroy the indomitable will of the colonial peoples. A united national liberation front is being established and consolidated to fight against the rule of foreign monopolists. The editorial emphasizes that the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements in colonies and dependent countries are closely linked to the struggle for peace, for the security and friendship of all peoples. The rising national liberation movement is leading dependent countries and colonies to the broad road of independence, people's democracy, and peace. All the perverse actions of imperialism are completely useless.

This issue also contains two articles discussing national independence and liberation struggles: "For a French Government that Upholds Peace and National Independence" by French Communist Party Central Committee member F. Billoux and "The Nigerian People Rise to Fight for Freedom" by P. DuBois. Billoux's article points out that the root of the recent French government crisis lies on the one hand, in the French bourgeois government's execution of a policy of national subjugation under the compulsion of the U.S. government, and on the other hand, in the firm demand of the French people to implement a policy of upholding peace, social progress, freedom, national sovereignty, and independence. The French Communist Party holds high the banner of democratic freedom and national independence, which the bourgeoisie has abandoned, and calls on men and women across the country to unite and strive to establish a government willing to implement a policy of national independence and peace. DuBois's article describes the heroic struggle of the Nigerian people in Africa under the cruel exploitation of British imperialism and domestic feudal forces, pointing out that Nigeria possesses all the objective conditions for developing a broad united national liberation front. If the Nigerian working class and its organizations put forward a national liberation program and advance shoulder to shoulder with the worldwide movement for peace, democracy, and socialism, they can unite all ethnic groups against imperialism.

In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's "On Cooperation," this issue publishes S. Bessonov's article entitled "A Programmatic Document of the International Communist Movement." The author first analyzes the great significance of Lenin's article for the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union, stating: After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, to build socialism, it was necessary to eliminate the country's backwardness and build heavy industry. Not only that, but it was also necessary to form small farmers into collective farms. Lenin believed that general cooperation, especially agricultural cooperation, was an easy-to-accept and easy-to-understand path for peasants to transition from small-scale economies to collective farms. In his article "On Cooperation," he pointed out for the first time in the history of Marxist theoretical thought the method for solving the most arduous task after the proletariat seized power—the task of the socialist transformation of agriculture—and pointed out how to attract millions of working peasants to participate in socialist construction and transform small-commodity agriculture onto the socialist road. The author then elaborates in detail on Comrade Stalin's theory of agricultural collectivization, which followed Lenin's instructions and further developed them, as well as the tasks of collective farms in the transition from socialist to communist society. The author concludes by saying that Lenin's cooperative plan and Stalin's collectivization theory are of great international significance. They are not only a guide for the Communist and Workers' Parties in countries where the working class has already seized power, but also a guide for the Communist and Workers' Parties in countries still under bourgeois rule.

This issue also contains an article by Max Reimann, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, entitled "The Treasonous Policy of the Right-Wing Social Democratic Leaders in West Germany." Reimann points out that the right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party, on the one hand, feign opposition to the Bonn regime fostered by the United States to deceive the masses, and on the other hand, openly maintain the foundation of this government, obstructing the unification of Germany, thereby violating the interests of the working class and the entire nation. The so-called "Action Program" adopted at the German Social Democratic Party congress at the end of last September clearly exposed these attempts. Reimann then refuted the treasonous domestic and foreign policies in the "Action Program" point by point, and called on German Communists to strive for joint action by the working class to launch a broad national liberation struggle.

In the article entitled "The Great Friendship Between the Soviet Union and China—A Powerful Fortress of Peace," this issue discusses the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the great significance for the cause of peace in connection with the Soviet government's free transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the government of the People's Republic of China. This issue also published a brief commentary, "The Grotesque Gathering of Right-Wing Socialists in Rangoon," exposing the truth about the Asian Socialist Conference. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第二期介绍
    共产党与工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第二期已经出版。
    本期以论述民族独立解放为主要内容，发表了题为“殖民地和附属国民族解放运动日益高涨”的社论。社论在谈到亚洲、非洲和中近东民族解放斗争的发展情况时，指出促成这种发展的最重要因素，是苏联在第二次世界大战中的世界历史性胜利所引起的法西斯德国和军国主义日本的溃败，各人民民主国家的兴起，和世界帝国主义力量的削弱。而中国人民革命的胜利以及中华人民共和国的建立，则使东方更加革命化，并促进了被压迫人民的伟大解放斗争的继续发展。社论说：殖民地和附属国的民族解放斗争是更积极更坚决了。在各个国家中，各地自发的分散的争取独立运动，现在越来越有组织，斗争是带有全国性的了。无论是殖民者的恐怖政策，也无论是受美帝国主义直接指挥的右翼社会党领袖们的叛变行为，都不能摧毁殖民地人民的不屈意志。为了反对外国垄断者的统治而斗争的民族解放统一战线，正在建立和巩固起来。社论强调说：殖民地和附属国的反帝国主义反封建的运动，是与争取和平、争取各国人民的安全和友谊的斗争紧密地联系着的。民族解放运动的日益高涨，把附属国和殖民地引向独立、人民民主及和平的康庄大道。帝国主义的一切倒行逆施是完全无用的。
    本期还刊载了两篇论述民族独立和解放斗争的文章：法国共产党中央委员弗·邦特的“争取一个维护和平与民族独立的法国政府”和帕·杜德的“尼日利亚人民起来为自由而斗争”。邦特的文章指出：最近法国政府危机的根源，一方面是法国资产阶级政府在美国政府强迫下执行亡国政策，另一方面是法国人民坚决要求执行维护和平、社会进步、自由、民族主权和独立的政策。法国共产党高举着资产阶级所抛弃的民主自由和民族独立的旗帜，号召全国男女团结起来为建立一个愿意执行民族独立与和平政策的政府而奋斗。杜德的文章叙述了非洲尼日利亚人民在英帝国主义和国内封建势力残酷的剥削下英勇斗争的情况，指出尼日利亚具有发展一条广泛的民族解放统一战线的一切客观条件。如果尼日利亚的工人阶级及其组织提出一个民族解放纲领，并与全世界争取和平、民主和社会主义的运动并肩前进，是可以把各族人民团结起来反对帝国主义的。
    本期为纪念列宁“论合作制”一文发表三十周年，刊载了斯·别苏德诺夫的题为“国际共产主义运动的纲领文件”的论文。作者首先分析了列宁这篇文章对于苏联建设社会主义的巨大意义，他说：在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，要建成社会主义，就必须消除国家的落后状态，建设重工业。不仅如此，还必须使小农户组成集体农庄。列宁认为一般合作制，特别是农业合作制，是农民易于接受和了解的从细小经济过渡到集体农庄的道路。他在“论合作制”这篇文章里，在马克思主义理论思想史上第一次指出了解决无产阶级夺取政权后的最艰巨的任务——农业的社会主义改造的任务——的方法，指出了如何才能吸引千百万劳动农民来参加社会主义建设，使小商品的农业转上社会主义的道路。作者接着详尽地阐释了斯大林同志遵循列宁的指示而发挥的农业集体化的理论，以及由社会主义过渡到共产主义社会中集体农庄的任务等。作者最后说：列宁的合作社计划和斯大林的集体化理论是有巨大的国际意义的。它们不但是那些在工人阶级已经取得政权的国家内的共产党和工人党的指南，而且也是那些仍在资产阶级统治下的国家的共产党和工人党的指南。
    本期还刊载了德国共产党中央委员会主席马·雷曼的“西德右翼社会民主党领袖的卖国政策”一文。雷曼指出：德国社会民主党的右翼领袖们，对美国扶植起来的波恩政权一面假意反对，欺骗群众，一面则公开维护这个政府的基础，阻挠德国的统一，从而违反了工人阶级和全民族的利益。去年九月底德国社会民主党代表大会上通过的所谓“行动纲领”，就明显地暴露了这些企图。雷曼接着逐条驳斥了“行动纲领”中卖国的对内对外政策，并号召德国共产党人争取工人阶级的联合行动，来展开广泛的民族解放斗争。
    本期在题为“苏联和中国的伟大友谊——强大的和平堡垒”的文章中，就苏联政府将中国长春铁路无偿地移交给中华人民共和国政府一事，论述了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，对于和平事业的伟大意义。本期还发表了“右翼社会党在仰光的群丑会”的简评，揭露了亚洲社会党会议的真相。（新华社）
