The state-owned department store in Baicheng County, Heilongjiang Province, during the entire process of asset inventory, capital verification, and implementation of the economic accounting system, neglected procurement and expanding sales, resulting in stockouts of certain commodities, which caused dissatisfaction among consumers and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. The First Store of the company closed for three days from January 22nd to 24th to carry out asset inventory and capital verification, leaving only the Second Store open, which did not handle wholesale business. Some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, without being notified, still went to the county's state-owned department store to purchase goods, only to find they had made a wasted trip. The person in charge of the company, fearing the accumulation of goods, was unwilling to purchase them, which led to a reduction in the scope of business and stockouts of certain commodities. The Baicheng area department store wholesale station sent people to investigate the stores of the Baicheng County Department Store Company and found that the store only had one type of blue serge and two types of blue fine cloth, while the wholesale station had ten types of blue serge and fourteen types of blue fine cloth. These fabrics were mostly needed by the local people, but the store was unwilling to purchase them. As the local people's living standards improved, they preferred gabardine, but the stores of the company did not have even a foot of it. According to the shop assistants, they used to have one or two types, but they sold out in a few days during the New Year's discount period, and the supply has been interrupted for nearly twenty-two days. Shop assistant Gao Junyi said: "Now our store has nothing. The leaders are carrying out asset inventory and capital verification, calling for a reduction in inventory. They don't care whether the store is out of stock or not, so sales are greatly affected." The shop assistants have raised objections to this situation, but the leading cadres of the store said: "The wholesale station doesn't have these goods." The staff of the state-owned Baicheng area department store wholesale station showed the shop assistants the wholesale station's inventory list. Only then did the shop assistants realize that the leading cadres of their store did not understand or were unwilling to understand the wholesale station's inventory situation. In this way, the store's sales plan could not be completed. By January 27th, only 50% of the January sales plan had been completed. The example of the state-owned department store in Baicheng County tells us that in order to implement the economic accounting system and solve the problem of commodity accumulation, state-owned trading enterprises should fully meet the needs of consumers and actively expand the scope of commodity circulation, rather than reduce the scope of commodity circulation and refuse to serve consumers.

    黑龙江省白城县国营百货公司所属商店只顾压缩库存造成商品脱销的现象
    黑龙江省白城县国营百货公司所属商店，在清理资产、核定资金以及贯彻经济核算制的整个过程中，忽视采购和扩大推销的工作，造成某些商品脱销的现象，引起消费者和基层供销合作社的不满。该公司所属第一商店于一月二十二日至二十四日关门三天，进行清理资产、核定资金工作，只剩下第二商店开门，还不做批发业务。某些基层供销合作社没有得到通知，仍旧到县国营百货商店采购货物，结果空跑了一趟。该公司负责人害怕积压商品，不愿进货，这就造成了经营范围缩小和某些商品脱销的现象。白城地区百货批发站曾派人到白城县百货公司所属商店调查，该商店只有一种蓝士林布，两种蓝细布，而批发站就有十种蓝士林布、十四种蓝细布。这些布匹多是当地群众需要的，该商店却不愿进货。当地人民生活提高，最喜欢华达呢布，该公司所属商店竟一尺也没有。据店员谈，过去有一、二种，在新年减价期间，几天就卖完了，供应中断将近二十二天。店员高俊一说：“现在我们商店要啥没啥，领导方面搞清产、核资，号召压缩库存，商店缺货不缺货，他都不管，所以推销上受到很大影响。”店员们曾对这种情况提过意见，但该商店的领导干部却说：“批发站没有这些货。”国营白城地区百货批发站的工作人员把批发站的库存表给店员们看了，店员们才知道是本商店领导干部不了解或不愿了解批发站库存情况。这样，该商店的推销计划当然不能完成。到一月二十七日，还只完成一月份推销计划的百分之五十。白城县国营百货公司所属商店的例子告诉我们：国营贸易企业为了贯彻经济核算制，解决商品积压的问题，应该充分满足消费者的需要，积极扩大商品流通范围，而不应缩小商品流通范围，拒绝为消费者服务。
