　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: A certain open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant set a new national record on January 28th by producing a heat of steel in three hours and fifty-nine minutes. At the time this new record was set, the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom area also reached 7.7 tons. After solving the problem of subcutaneous bubbles in steel ingots last fall, the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant further tapped the potential of the equipment during the winter checkup, increasing steel production by 11.05%. After studying the People's Daily New Year's Day editorial this year, the department's employees unanimously proposed to further promote the "fast steelmaking method." The workers in the open-hearth furnace section set out a production schedule for each shift. The workers in the raw materials section also promoted the rapid charging method, and they have now increased from charging three furnaces of material per day to four and a half. The gas section and the ingot casting section also ensured gas supply and timely tapping. Therefore, in the six days from January 23rd to 28th, they created seven new records, and the smelting time for each heat of steel was gradually shortened. Among them, a certain open-hearth furnace set a new national record of three hours and fifty-nine minutes to produce a heat of steel on the 28th, which was fifty-five minutes shorter than the plant's previous highest record.

    创造平炉炼钢全国新纪录
    【新华社太原十九日电】国营太原钢铁厂炼钢部某号平炉在一月二十八日创造三时五十九分炼一炉钢的全国新纪录。这次新纪录出现时，每一平方公尺炉底面积产钢量也达到了七点七吨。太原钢铁厂炼钢部继去年秋季解决了钢锭皮下气泡问题以后，又在冬季的查定中挖掘了设备的潜在能力，使钢的产量提高了百分之十一点零五。今年该部职工在学习人民日报元旦社论后，又一致提出要进一步推广“快速炼钢法”。平炉工段的职工订出每班的生产进度表。原料工段的职工也推广了快速装料法，现在他们已由每日装三炉料提高到装四炉半。煤气工段、铸锭工段也保证了煤气供应和按时出钢。因此，在一月二十三日至二十八日的六天内，就创造了七次新纪录，每炉钢的冶炼时间逐渐缩短。其中某号平炉在二十八日创造的三时五十九分炼一炉钢的全国新纪录，比该厂过去最高纪录时间缩短了五十五分钟。
