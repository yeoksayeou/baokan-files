Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: "Pravda" published an article on the 26th, entitled "The Collapse of the Benelux Economic Group."

    The author, Afonin, wrote: American imperialism, under the banner of restoring Western European economies, pieced together many military and political blocs and alliances. But soon they abandoned their "revivalist" mask and revealed their true faces as aggressors. They use all groups to invade the economies of Western European countries in order to achieve the goal of preparing for new wars. In this regard, the fate of the Benelux Economic Group is particularly illustrative.

    American monopoly capital is invading the uranium-rich Belgian Congo. American goods flood the Belgian and Dutch markets, causing serious blows to the Belgian and Dutch economies.

    The frantic arms race has driven up the cost of living, impoverished the masses, and caused mass unemployment. According to official figures, the Netherlands' annual military expenditure exceeds 1.5 billion guilders. In reality, the number is much higher.

    Last year, Belgium's military expenditure was five times that of 1948, and this year's military expenditure accounts for about half of the total budget.

    The situation in Luxembourg is the same, and its economy is increasingly turning to arms expansion and war preparations.

    Civilian industries in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have been shrinking, factories are closing down, and thousands of small and medium-sized factories have gone bankrupt, and this bankruptcy process is accelerating all the time.

    Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have lost their political and economic independence. Their national sovereignty has been trampled upon. American imperialism, like in many other capitalist countries, prohibits Belgium and the Netherlands from trading in the markets of democratic camp countries.

    The expansion of the arms race, the militarization of the economy, the reduction and, in some cases, complete cessation of trade with the countries of the peace camp have had a very adverse impact on the economic situation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Competition between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg has become increasingly fierce. The fantasy of the ruling groups of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to form a "united front" in the market in order to take concerted action has been shattered, and disputes have begun. At present, the contradictions between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have become very sharp. For example, in Belgium, a special committee has been established to protect the interests of Belgium and Luxembourg against Dutch competition.

    Afonin concluded by writing: The example of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg vividly illustrates that groups of capitalist countries pieced together by American monopoly capital are on the verge of collapse under the blows of imperialist contradictions.

    在美国的奴役和掠夺下
    比荷卢经济集团正趋于崩溃
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十六日发表一篇论文，题目是“比、荷、卢经济集团的崩溃”。
    作者阿弗宁写道：美帝国主义打着恢复西欧经济的旗帜，拼凑了许多军事和政治集团和同盟。但是不久他们就抛弃了他们的“复兴者”的假面具，露出侵略者的真正面孔。他们利用所有的集团来侵入西欧国家的经济，以便达到准备新战争的目的。在这一方面，比、荷、卢经济集团的命运尤其可以说明这个问题。
    美国垄断资本正在侵入富有铀矿的比属刚果。美国货物充斥比利时和荷兰市场。使比利时和荷兰的经济受到严重的打击。
    疯狂的军备竞赛使生活费用高涨，群众生活贫困，人民大批失业。根据官方的数字，荷兰每年的军费开支超过了十五亿荷盾。实际上，数目还要高得多。
    去年，比利时的军费相当于一九四八年的五倍，今年的军事开支约占总预算的一半。
    卢森堡的情形也是一样，它的经济已越来越转向扩军备战。
    比、荷、卢三国的民用工业已在缩减，工厂纷纷倒闭，数以千计的中小工厂都破产了，而且这种破产过程无时不在加速着。
    比、荷、卢三国已丧失了它们的政治和经济的独立。他们的国家主权遭到了蹂躏。美帝国主义也像对许多其他资本主义国家一样，禁止比利时与荷兰在民主阵营国家的市场上作买卖。
    扩张军备运动、经济军事化、对和平阵营国家的贸易的减少和在某种情况下的完全停止，对于比、荷、卢的经济情况有着非常恶劣的影响。比、荷、卢之间的竞争已越来越激烈。比、荷、卢统治集团在市场上成立“联合阵线”，以便采取一致行动的妄想破灭了，争吵开始了。目前，比、荷、卢之间的矛盾已经十分尖锐，譬如在比利时，就已经成立了一个特别委员会，来保护比利时和卢森堡的利益，对付荷兰的竞争。
    阿弗宁最后写道：比、荷、卢的例子生动地说明了，由美国垄断资本撮合成的资本主义国家集团，在帝国主义矛盾的打击下正趋于崩溃。
