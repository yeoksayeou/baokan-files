    Anshan "Worker's Life" Newspaper Encountered Serious Obstruction from Bureaucrats in Carrying Out Criticism
    An Gang
    Editor's Note: The obstacles encountered by the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper in carrying out bottom-up criticism are serious. Many responsible Party member cadres have repeatedly resisted and suppressed newspaper criticism. The most prominent examples include Sha YouShi, Director of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Ma ChengDe, Director of the Steelmaking Plant, Hu RenShou, Director of the Political Department of the Housing Construction Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shen DongLi, Member of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Director of the Organization Department, and Fan WenCai, President of the Anshan Municipal People's Court. Sha YouShi not only ignored newspaper criticism but also openly insulted correspondents as "bastards" and said "there is not a single good person." Shen DongLi, in order to defend his wife Su Dong's mistakes, did not hesitate to use his authority to write letters to the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the newspaper office, categorically denying the facts and demanding that the newspaper make corrections. When the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper encountered such serious problems, the Municipal Party Committee did not actively lead newspaper criticism, support newspaper criticism, and impose disciplinary sanctions on those who resisted newspaper criticism; on the contrary, the vast majority of Municipal Party Committee members agreed at the Municipal Party Committee meeting to punish worker correspondent Cao YongKui. Municipal Party Committee Secretary Han TianShi also issued "instructions" restricting newspaper criticism, which further hindered the development of open criticism by the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper.
    The attitude of Anshan Municipal Party Committee Secretary Han TianShi and former Secretary Yang ChunMao towards these events shows that they violated the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals." They did not attach importance to the Central Committee's instruction that "attracting the people to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and periodicals, and educating Party members, especially Party cadres, to make self-criticism about these shortcomings and errors in newspapers and periodicals, is even more prominently important today." "If we cannot openly and promptly launch criticism and self-criticism about the shortcomings and errors of our Party, the People's Government, and all economic organs and mass organizations among the whole Party and the broad masses of the people, we will be seriously poisoned by bureaucracy and unable to complete the construction tasks of the new China." Therefore, we hope that the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau will be responsible for urging the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and Sha YouShi and others to conduct self-criticism, and launch a struggle against bureaucracy among the workers and staff to ensure the smooth completion of Anshan's huge economic construction tasks, and hope to write the results of the handling to this newspaper.
    The Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper is the organ of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, founded on February 7, 1949, and it has now been in existence for four years. The most unsatisfactory aspect of this newspaper is that it has not adhered to the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" to carry out criticism, especially it has not strictly adhered to bottom-up criticism. Workers and cadres have reflected that "the newspaper does not solve problems, cannot reflect the opinions of the broad masses, and does not dare to carry out criticism," "it doesn't matter whether you read it or not, it's not interesting." But the main reason for this situation is that bureaucrats have suppressed the political enthusiasm of the newspaper and the broad masses for criticism.

    Suppressors of Criticism Have Suppressed the Political Enthusiasm of the Newspaper and the Broad Masses for Criticism
    The editorial department of the "Worker's Life" newspaper has done some work in carrying out criticism, but since October 1951, the criticism in the newspaper has been greatly hindered by some bureaucrats who resist and suppress newspaper criticism. They have used their authority to suppress the political enthusiasm of the broad masses for criticism.
    Now let us "bring these bureaucrats into the sunlight" and see how they resist and suppress newspaper criticism.
    The first is Sha YouShi, Director of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He has consistently resisted criticism. In 1950, the "Worker's Life" newspaper criticized the locomotive plant of the Transportation Department for having insufficient heating, making it impossible to work. Sha YouShi not only did not respond to this but also accused the newspaper of making a mistake at the Municipal Party Committee enlarged meeting, saying: "The company sends us stone coal, so the heating is simply not good, what can I do!" At the beginning of 1951, Dong HuaChun, a model worker at the ore dressing plant, wrote a letter reflecting that the staff of the Transportation Department rode trains without paying. The newspaper reporter took the letter of criticism to Sha to look at. After reading it, he flew into a rage and said: "I have never paid for riding trains. These bastards (referring to the people who wrote the letters of criticism) are not good people." The reporter did not argue with him and took the letter back. In 1951, Anshan City held a suppression of counter-revolutionaries rally. The Municipal Party Committee notified all factories and mines to suspend production for two hours to organize listening to the live broadcast of the rally. However, the locomotive plant of the Transportation Department, on the pretext of "being afraid of delaying production," did not implement this decision. Workers in the factory called the newspaper to criticize them. The newspaper investigated and found the situation to be true and published an open criticism in the newspaper. Sha YouShi, after seeing the newspaper, immediately called the newspaper's president to question him. He called twice, Sha's attitude was very rude, and he told the reporter Hou Yun who wrote the article to "come over immediately!" As soon as Sha saw Hou, he questioned him, saying: "Tell me, why did you write this article? Examine your motives!" Hou then said: "The situation reflected by the correspondent is factual, the criticism is correct, have you read the Central Committee's Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals?" He immediately changed the subject and said:
    "I hope you will pay attention to the historical background of the correspondents and do not think that they are all reliable." But Sha has not yet responded to the criticism in the newspaper.
    After the "Three-Anti" campaign, with the help of the Municipal Party Committee, he made a self-criticism. It is said that he has made some improvements in his understanding, but his erroneous thinking has not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, the Transportation Department still lacks a democratic atmosphere. In July 1952, the organization section chief of the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions wrote a letter criticizing the Transportation Department for arbitrarily dismissing workers. After the manuscript was published, the newspaper called the Transportation Department three times to urge them to reply, but Sha YouShi ignored them. The newspaper also received a letter from workers in the Transportation Department expressing opinions on the dismissal of workers. The newspaper sent someone to take the letter to Sha. After reading the letter, Sha questioned him: Who wrote the manuscript? Do you know what the readers do? What they are like? Finally, he said angrily: "I don't care about your affairs." He threw his sleeves and strode away. These criticisms have not yet been publicly answered in the newspaper. In October 1952, Su XingYuan, a model worker of the carpentry team at the construction site of the large rolling mill, wrote a letter to the newspaper protesting against the Transportation Department's law enforcement captain for illegally detaining Zhao ShengLin and Su XingYuan without reason. The editorial department printed this letter into an internal reference material and sent it to the Municipal Party Committee, the company, and the Transportation Department. It has been four months now, and the Transportation Department has not been responsible for handling it.
    The second is Ma ChengDe, director of the steelmaking plant. He has taken retaliatory and suppressive measures against critics. Cao YongKui (an old worker), a correspondent for the "Worker's Life" newspaper, is the deputy director of the ingot casting workshop of the steelmaking plant and an active social activist. He once criticized the plant for not paying attention to the welfare of employees, for not distributing protective equipment in a timely manner, and for the leadership (without directly naming anyone) arbitrarily deciding to use state steel materials and labor to make a small car for the child of the branch director of the plant. Regarding the former, the plant's technology and security section only emphasized the difficulties and gave a perfunctory answer. Regarding the latter, Ma ChengDe said: "Your criticism is incorrect. I not only made a small car for the child of the branch director of the repair shop, but also made one for the child of the deputy director. I, the director, have the right to approve it." From then on, Ma ChengDe held a prejudice against Cao YongKui. At one meeting, Ma said to Cao: "You can write articles to the newspaper to criticize the leadership. Your own workshop has shortcomings, why don't you criticize yourself?" According to Cao YongKui, Ma ChengDe has made such sarcastic remarks to him more than once. Later, Cao YongKui felt depressed and said to the comrades in the newspaper: "I will never write articles again, I can't stand this kind of attack." The newspaper wrote this situation into a written material and prepared to publish it in the newspaper, and submitted it to the Municipal Party Committee for review. The then-incumbent Municipal Party Committee Secretary Yang ChunMao did not comment on it but turned the material over to Ma ChengDe, asking him to check whether it was true. After receiving the material, Ma immediately went to the Party Committee office (at that time, two reporters from the "Worker's Life" newspaper were also in the office). As soon as he entered the door, he slammed the letter and said: "This is terrible, what has Cao YongKui done!" He said to the Party Committee Secretary: "I suggest that a Party Committee meeting be convened immediately to study this issue." A Party Committee meeting was convened at that time. At the meeting, most people believed that Cao YongKui's criticism was incorrect, that he did not obey the leadership, that he was passive in his work, and that he should be punished. At the end of the meeting, only Party Committee member Chen Jie raised doubts and said: "It is not appropriate to deal with it in this way. Wouldn't this become suppressing criticism?" After that, the newspaper urged the Municipal Party Committee, but there was still no result, so it ended without resolution. Not only was Cao YongKui's problem not solved, but the relationship between Cao YongKui and the newspaper was basically broken. He still does not dare to "write criticism articles." In June 1951, the newspaper reporter criticized the shortcomings of the production leadership of the steelmaking plant. The newspaper sent a reporter to ask Ma ChengDe to review the manuscript, and an appointment was made by phone beforehand. After the reporter went, he said angrily: "I won't read it!" The reporter had to give it to the Party Committee Secretary to read. Since the manuscript was published, Ma ChengDe has not made any reply. The newspaper also received a letter from a technician Xu DingYu criticizing the steelmaking plant for poor quality of steel ingots and for not complying with technical regulations. The newspaper forwarded it to Ma ChengDe and it was "lost". It was found in his office half a month later.
    In the great "Three-Anti" movement, the Municipal Party Committee sent many cadres to help Ma ChengDe solve ideological problems. It took more than a month for Ma to make a more comprehensive self-criticism. After the "Three-Anti" movement, Ma ChengDe changed his abusive attitude. However, according to investigations by reporters, Ma ChengDe has not yet sought a solution from the ideological point of view on issues such as relying on the Party and relying on the working class. This is why he still cannot conduct a public review in the newspaper in accordance with the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers after the "Three-Anti" campaign.
    The third is the bad behavior of Hu RenShou, Director of the Political Department of the Housing Construction Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and others who suppressed and attacked criticism. In mid-November 1952, the "Worker's Life" newspaper successively received two letters from Zhao QiLiang (pen name Zhao Li) and Zhao MuKong (pen name Tie Feng), correspondents of the LiShan Housing Construction Department, criticizing the material section of the department for violating labor laws and repeatedly forcing workers to work overtime. The newspaper investigation proved that it was in accordance with the facts and published a criticism in the newspaper on November 30 last year. However, some leading cadres of the Housing Construction Department did not express any attitude for forty days after the newspaper criticism. Instead, they retaliated against the writer. During the democratic remedial class on January 3, branch secretary Li YiKui criticized Zhao for writing articles "without the branch's review is unorganized and undisciplined." And asked him "Why don't you write your real name when writing articles." He also said that after the newspaper published the criticism, "it affected the emotions of the staff of the material section." Hu RenShou, director of the political department and deputy secretary of the general branch, believed that Zhao QiLiang was "acting first and reporting later." Yang MingYing, another person in charge of the political department, also believed that Zhao's article criticizing the material section was:
    "The trade union is using the administration as capitalists to fight." After Zhao QiLiang was attacked, he immediately reported the situation to the newspaper. The newspaper sent a reporter to investigate and confirmed that the leadership of the department did have acts of suppressing criticism. He immediately expressed his opinions to Manager Chen (secretary of the general branch) and Hu RenShou of the engineering department. Not only did they not admit that there were acts of suppressing criticism, but they also said that "the manuscript exaggerates the facts." "There are not so many sick workers due to working overtime." The reporter asked them how many workers were sick, but they could not give a specific figure. When the "Worker's Life" newspaper reporter took the materials to exchange opinions with Hu RenShou on January 12, although Hu admitted these facts, he did not admit that there were acts of suppressing criticism. He said: "You are willing to publish it in the newspaper, we can also publish it in the People's Daily." At the same time, Zhao QiLiang was further retaliated against. They believed that Zhao's reporting their acts of suppressing criticism to the newspaper was "ideologically dishonest"; When discussing Zhao QiLiang's transfer to the Party, they also investigated "Why didn't you use your real name when writing the manuscript?" "Why didn't you go through the branch review when writing the manuscript?" At the branch meeting on January 12, when the organ branch discussed Zhao QiLiang's transfer to the Party, Li YiKui first announced on behalf of the branch that he did not agree with Zhao QiLiang's transfer to the Party. Hu RenShou put forward four opinions to Zhao at the branch meeting, two of which were on Zhao's writing of criticism articles. He said that Zhao's writing of criticism articles without organizational review was "individual heroism"; Saying that Zhao's "understanding of democratic remedial classes is not clear", "Everyone not only did not accept the opinions put forward on his writing of criticism articles in the democratic remedial class, but also sent people to the newspaper to get the original manuscript to confront... "And once again questioned Zhao "the motives for writing manuscripts criticizing the material section."
    After the "Worker's Life" newspaper published "Some leading cadres of the Housing Construction Department lack a democratic style and suppress criticism" on January 15, the Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Committee and the Basic Construction Political Department sent people to the department to conduct an inspection. After the inspection personnel conducted a preliminary inspection, in order to obtain a consensus in understanding, they exchanged opinions with Hu RenShou on January 17. Hu not only did not admit the facts on the spot, but flew into a rage and said: "Your inspection is not for treating diseases and saving people, but for finding fault. According to the materials you inspected, we people should be beheaded!" And said: "Democratic remedial classes, transfer to the Party, and newspaper publishing should be viewed separately. If you link them together, it will aggravate our mistakes." Comrade Yang MingYing also said to the newspaper: Criticism of Zhao QiLiang for writing criticism articles without organizational review,
    "It is not considered suppressing democracy", it is "the newspaper suppressing their democracy."
    Now, Hu RenShou has initially realized his mistakes, but he still expresses a skeptical attitude towards the issue of Party member cadres writing articles and reporting situations to the newspaper without going through the branch review, and believes that problems that can be solved internally "should not be published in the newspaper." He has not yet given a public and sincere reply to the newspaper's criticism.
    The fourth is Fan WenCai, President of the People's Court of Anshan City. On November 30 last year, a letter from Li ShuXian, Chairman of the LiShan Private Enterprise Trade Union Committee, was published in the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper. The letter exposed the old judicial style of the Anshan Municipal People's Court for unreasonably summoning him because he reported the capitalists, "If you do not appear in court on time, you will be arrested according to law." The letter also pointed out that after he arrived at the TieDong District People's Court on time, he waited for a long time, and no one knew "what case it was", so he was transferred to the Municipal People's Court. He waited a long time at the Municipal People's Court before he found out that it was because he reported the LiShan XingAn Iron Factory's capitalists for arrears of wages to the workers. However, the court did not summon the reported capitalists, and the people in the court's reception room rudely said to Li: "We won't summon you if there is nothing to do. If we summon you, there is something to do. Just do what we tell you." After this reader's letter was published, Fan WenCai questioned the editor-in-chief of the newspaper: "What if you criticize incorrectly?" Then, he called the newspaper's reader's letter group and said:
    "Please send someone over, we want to check who is right and who is wrong. We have to
    We need to compare the situation together, and the person who wants to write the criticism article should also come." The comrade from the newspaper replied: "It is okay for us to go, but it is not reasonable for the person who wrote the article to go." Fan said: "We are not attacking, we are just looking at the situation." After the leader of the reader's letter group went, he saw that Fan's attitude was very bad, indicating that the newspaper should not criticize the court. The comrade from the newspaper said: "You should not summon the whistleblower like summoning a criminal." Fan said: "Our court uses the same summons for everyone, that's how it used to be. If your newspaper thinks it's not good, can you change our summons?" When talking about not bringing people over and forgetting to ask questions, causing the whistleblower to wait for a long time in vain, other responsible cadres of the court also disagreed with this criticism. After arguing, Fan WenCai reluctantly admitted that it was wrong, but also said: "Although the criticism is correct, our court has much bigger problems than this." After repeated urging, he replied: "Our hospital still does not pay enough attention to the improvement of judicial paper. ... As for the case handler and the people in the reception room, they have all deeply examined their old judicial work style in the judicial reform movement." That is to say: The Anshan Municipal People's Court did not have any bureaucracy, but only "still did not pay enough attention to the improvement of judicial paper." However, Li ShuXian's criticism of "the case handler and the people in the reception room" was not before the judicial reform movement, but after the judicial reform movement. How can two different times be forcibly brought together?
    Comrade Shen DongLi, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, believed that the newspaper's criticism of his wife Su Dong was "unfair and untrue." However, what is the truth of this criticism article? The newspaper convened a forum of Party, administrative, and Youth League cadres of the Women's Federation to solicit opinions on the criticism article. Everyone agreed that the criticism was correct, and only one place said that Su Dong was the Party branch secretary should be changed to "used to be the Party branch secretary." Everyone on the spot added a lot of new opinions and materials on Su Dong's wrong behavior and submitted them to the Municipal Party Committee. The newspaper also again sought the opinions of Lei Ke, Secretary of the directly affiliated Party Committee. Lei Ke fully agreed with the newspaper's criticism and provided some new materials to the Municipal Party Committee. The Municipal Party Committee did not attach importance to these opinions. Despite the unanimous opinions from all parties, Shen DongLi requested to publicly publish Su Dong's correction letter. He believed that "articles criticizing the work of the Women's Federation and criticizing the Secretary of the Women's Federation Party Committee (note: referring to Su Dong) should not be reviewed by the directly affiliated Party Committee, but should be reviewed by the Municipal Party Committee." And said: "I am one of the members of the Municipal Party Committee and know more about the situation than the reporters, but you did not accept any of my opinions. Our newspaper speaks on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, not on behalf of a reporter or an editor." Finally, he believed that not allowing Su Dong to "appeal" was "unreasonable and abnormal." And he repeatedly stated: "Su Dong's letter to the editorial department of the newspaper is in accordance with the facts" because "I have seen it", so "it should be published." Under his influence, Su Dong has not yet made a self-criticism.

    Why the Struggle Against Resisters of Criticism Cannot Be Unfolded
    Why has the open bottom-up criticism of the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper not been carried out well for a long time? In addition to the lack of courage to persist in the struggle by the editorial department of the "Worker's Life" newspaper, another major reason is that the Anshan Municipal Party Committee has not seriously led and supported newspaper criticism, has not launched a struggle against resisters of criticism, and even has a wrong understanding of newspaper criticism. Some people believe that "it's enough to have made a self-criticism internally or made some criticisms," thus ignoring the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" to carry out criticism in newspapers. The letter from Municipal Party Committee Secretary Han TianShi to the newspaper on October 8, 1951, played a restrictive role in launching criticism in newspapers. The full text of the letter is:
    "Comrade ××: Recently, 'Worker's Life' has published a lot of criticism articles. I think we must proceed with caution, so the following procedures should be followed before publishing:
    1. When criticizing working cadres and workers below the section chief level, it should be reviewed by the Party Committee Secretary and Director of the factory or mine. The company must be reviewed by the heads of the relevant departments and the director of the personnel department. The municipal government system must be reviewed by the relevant bureaus and the personnel bureau. If there are different opinions, it must be approved by the Municipal Party Committee.
    2. When criticizing cadres above the level of section chief, factory director, mine director, bureau director, engineer, Party Committee Secretary, Trade Union Chairman, and Youth League Secretary, it should be approved by the Municipal Party Committee.
    Secondly, within a certain period of time (such as one month), the number of criticism articles should not exceed the number of praise articles, and the number of articles should not exceed two-thirds to one-half.
    Again, criticism should be carried out purposefully, and should be based on the current specific tasks and requirements, such as currently criticizing the idea of not attaching importance to relying on the working class, not mobilizing the masses in completing tasks, and not giving full play to potential, etc.
    Do not criticize everything that comes along, and do not publish letters as they are."
    The background when this letter was issued was: At the Municipal Party Committee enlarged meeting ten days ago, some people who resisted criticism, such as Sha YouShi and Ma ChengDe, took the opportunity to give opinions to the Municipal Party Committee and accused the newspaper one after another. Sha YouShi said: "80% of the criticism articles in the 'Worker's Life' newspaper are incorrect." He asked the Municipal Party Committee to "strengthen leadership" over the newspaper. The Municipal Party Committee meeting adopted a tacit and tolerant attitude towards these opinions. After the comrades from the newspaper who attended the meeting returned, they felt wronged and discouraged, believing that "the newspaper was scolded for carrying out criticism" and "it is better not to criticize, or to criticize less." After receiving this letter, the thinking of the entire editorial department became even more confused. The person in charge of the newspaper wrote a letter to Comrade Han TianShi expressing disagreement. The reply received said: "I said that when criticizing the work of a certain unit, you should solicit the opinions of the responsible comrades of that unit - not to ask him to approve it. This is because we have a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Isn't it better to listen to the opinions of the comrades below and then listen to the opinions of the leading comrades? Will this conflict with the Central Committee's decision? What harm will this do?..."
    It is said that Han TianShi's motive for writing these two letters was to ask the newspaper to conduct criticism cautiously. However, he did not estimate the serious situation caused by the bad behavior of some who resisted criticism, did not enthusiastically lead criticism, support criticism, and create conditions for criticism, and did not set up a correct and sincere example of treating criticism; on the contrary, he put forward some incorrect or unrealistic opinions. The leadership of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department over the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper is weak, and sometimes even abandons leadership. Of course, the "Worker's Life" newspaper can only be run into a newspaper that "it doesn't matter whether you read it or not".
    The so-called "proceed with caution" is completely necessary. According to the situation of the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper carrying out criticism, they are not cautious enough, but too much. They took the masses' letters of criticism to the people being criticized to read, and to criticize certain people, they had to go through multiple investigations and be reviewed by several members of the Municipal Party Committee. After their criticism was hindered, they wrote materials repeatedly requesting the Municipal Party Committee to deal with the problem of resisting criticism. They compiled the masses' criticisms into internal reference documents for the leading comrades to refer to. All of this is how "cautious"! However, such "caution" has not been able to change the attitude of those who resist criticism. From the time the Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" in 1950 to the present, a total of 565 criticism articles of all sizes have been published in the newspaper. All the criticism articles are basically correct, and there is not a single one that is completely untrue or mostly untrue. And in these 565 criticism articles, the number of articles that were not responded to by the criticized reached 293. Can we use "proceeding with caution" to move those who resist criticism?
    "The 'Worker's Life' newspaper has a lot of criticism articles", the following statistics can answer this question. First of all, from the perspective of the number of criticism articles published by the newspaper over the years after the Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" in April 1950: From May to December of 1950, a total of 141 criticism articles were published in seven months. In the whole year of 1951, a total of 316 criticism articles were published. In the whole year of 1952 (at this time, the newspaper was changed to every other day), a total of only 108 articles were published. The number of criticism articles published in the whole year of 1952 was not even as many as in the seven months of 1950. Secondly, the content of criticism can be roughly divided into three types: criticism of leading cadres of various units, criticism of cadre style, and mutual criticism between workers. Among these three types of criticism, the first type of criticism has the greatest effect on promoting work. However, this type of criticism is getting worse and worse. Fifty-four articles were published from May to December 1950, 134 articles were published in the whole year of 1951, and the number dropped to 40 articles in the whole year of 1952. Is it better not to let the masses know about the shortcomings in the work? Or is it better to attract more masses to supervise? Please listen to what Malenkov said: "The more masses are absorbed in eliminating the shortcomings in our work, the stronger the bottom-up supervision of the activities of all our organizations, the smoother our work will be in various fields."
    "There should be a quantitative limit on criticism articles published in newspapers." In fact, even during the most active period of criticism in the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, the number of criticism articles never exceeded one-eighth of the entire newspaper's space. In the past four years, only one issue accounted for one-quarter of the entire newspaper's space. The key is obviously not to stipulate the ratio of praise and criticism articles, but to enthusiastically lead criticism and not regard criticism as a negative thing that makes things difficult for one's own leadership work. For the Communist Party, bottom-up criticism is a manifestation of the spontaneous creativity and initiative of millions of people, and it is a sense of responsibility of the working class as the noble masters of the motherland. We "adhere to the truth and correct mistakes," which is the source of our life.
    "Prescribing criticism tasks for a certain period of time" is okay as a focus of attention for the leadership, but it must not restrict newspaper criticism as a result. Criticism should be the daily work of the entire Party, and criticism should not be restricted to a certain scope. Whether it is central work or general work, we should use the weapon of criticism to fight against all unhealthy phenomena and shortcomings.
    "Do not publish letters as they are", is this right or wrong? According to statistics, the number of reader letters published in the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper has never exceeded 10% of all letters at most. It is impossible and unnecessary to publish all letters as they are. However, the Party and the Party newspaper must attach great importance to every letter. The biggest shortcoming of the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper is not "publishing letters as they are", but "forwarding letters as they are". They forwarded them to the "relevant organs" without any effective supervision. Many letters that should have been brought to the masses to be solved were piled up in the office of the organ and no one paid attention to them. Some of the workers' letters reflect very important issues, but some of them are very small issues, and some are even "criticizing everything that comes along". The responsibility of the Party and the Party newspaper is not to despise or let go of these small things, "Big things are often the basis of small things." We must treat the workers' letters as political documents as Lenin said, and treat them with the utmost respect. This is one of the important signs that the Party relies on the working class and believes in the masses.
    It is clear that such a letter that has not been carefully considered can be sent to the newspaper by the Municipal Party Committee, indicating that there is a lack of principle within the Anshan Municipal Party Committee. Comrade Han TianShi said in his second letter that he "does not have enough understanding of the situation", but at that time, he had been transferred to Anshan for nearly two months, and other members of the Municipal Party Committee who had read the letter understood the actual situation. However, they adopted a liberal attitude, some expressing their agreement to sign and approve it, and some seeing the letter and thinking that it was "not right", but they did not formally put forward their opinions at the Municipal Party Committee meeting in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee to carry out criticism and self-criticism. This is a lesson worth remembering.

    How to Solve the Problem of Unfolding Criticism in the Anshan "Worker's Life" Newspaper in the Future
    After the great "Three-Anti" movement, there has been progress in the work of Anshan, and the leadership level of the Party and the ideological awareness of cadres have gradually improved; but it must also be admitted that, judging from the problems reflected in the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee has an insufficient understanding of the principled issue of unfolding bottom-up criticism in the newspapers, many views are lagging behind reality, and even incorrect. Therefore, in order to thoroughly solve the problem of vigorously unfolding open criticism in the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper in the future. The Anshan Municipal Party Committee must further strengthen its leadership over the newspaper, and in accordance with the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals", take the lead in conducting an in-depth inspection of the issue of unfolding criticism in newspapers, and seriously launch a struggle against bureaucracy, against coercion and commandism, and against violations of laws and regulations in all units of the city; lead and support bottom-up criticism in newspapers, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all phenomena of resisting and suppressing criticism; for those who have been criticized by the newspaper and have not seriously given a responsible explanation to the masses or have resisted criticism, the Party organization has the responsibility to help and instruct them to conduct a public and sincere self-criticism in the newspaper; for those with serious mistakes, appropriate treatment should be given to recover the negative impact that has been created among the masses.

    编者按：鞍山“工人生活”报在开展自下而上的批评中所遇到的阻碍是严重的。有不少相当负责的党员干部多次地抗拒和压制报纸批评。举其最大者，即有鞍山钢铁公司运输部主任沙友石、炼钢厂厂长马成德、钢铁公司住宅工程处政治处主任胡仁寿、中共鞍山市委委员兼组织部副部长申东黎、鞍山市人民法院院长范文采等人。沙友石对报纸批评不但置之不理，而且公开辱骂通讯员是“王八蛋”，“没有一个好人”。申东黎为辩护其妻子苏东的错误，则不惜利用职权写信给市委宣传部和报社，矢口否认事实，要报社更正。鞍山“工人生活”报遇到这样严重的问题时，市委不是积极领导报纸批评，支持报纸批评，予抗拒报纸批评的人以纪律制裁；相反的，绝大多数市委委员竟在市委会议上同意处分工人通讯员曹永魁。市委书记韩天石并作出了限制报纸批评的“指示”，就更加阻碍了鞍山“工人生活”报公开批评的展开。
    鞍山市委书记韩天石以及前任书记杨春茂等同志对待这些事件的态度说明：他们违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，他们没有重视中央指示中所指出的：“吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并教育党员，特别是党的干部在报纸刊物上作关于这些缺点和错误的自我批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。”“如果我们对于我们党的、人民政府的及所有经济机关和群众团体的缺点和错误，不能公开地及时地在全党和广大人民中展开批评与自我批评，我们就要被严重的官僚主义所毒害，不能完成新中国的建设任务。”所以我们希望东北局纪律检查委员会负责督促鞍山市委和沙友石等人进行检讨，并在职工中开展反对官僚主义的斗争，以保证鞍山巨大经济建设任务的顺利完成，并望把处理结果写给本报。
    鞍山“工人生活”报是中共鞍山市委的机关报，创刊于一九四九年二月七日，到现在，它已经有了四年的历史。这个报纸办得最不能令人满意的地方，是没有按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”来坚持开展批评，特别是没有严正地坚持自下而上的批评。工人和干部们反映：“报纸不解决问题，不能反映广大群众的意见，不敢进行批评”，“看不看都可以，没有劲。”但造成这种情况的主要原因，则是官僚主义者打击了报社和广大群众进行批评的政治热情。
    压制批评者打击了报社和广大群众进行批评的政治热情
    “工人生活”报编辑部对于开展批评曾经做了一定的工作，但是从一九五一年十月以来，报纸上的批评受到了一些抗拒、压制报纸批评的官僚主义者的极大阻难。他们利用职权打击了广大群众进行批评的政治热情。
    现在让我们把这些官僚主义者“拉到日光下来”，看看他们是怎样抗拒和压制报纸批评的。
    第一个是鞍山钢铁公司运输部主任沙友石。他一贯地抗拒批评。一九五○年“工人生活”报批评了运输部机车厂暖气烧不热，工作时伸不出手。沙友石对此不但不作答复，反而在市委扩大会议上指责报纸批评错了，说：“公司发的都是石头煤，暖气就是烧不热，我有什么办法！”一九五一年初，选矿厂劳动模范董华春写信反映运输部的工作人员坐火车不花钱，报社记者把批评信拿给沙看，他看后大发脾气说：“我坐火车从来就是不花钱，这些王八蛋（指写信提出批评的人）没有一个好人。”记者没同他争辩，带信而回。一九五一年鞍山市召开镇压反革命大会，市委通知各厂、矿停止两小时生产，组织收听大会实况广播。但是运输部机车厂借口“怕耽误生产”，不执行这个决定。该厂工人向报社打电话提出批评，报社调查情况属实，在报纸上提出了公开批评。沙友石见报，马上打电话质问报社社长。两次打电话，沙的态度都很蛮横，并要写这稿子的记者侯韵“马上来一趟！”沙一见侯即质问说：“你讲一讲，你为什么要写这稿子？检查检查你的动机！”侯便说：“通讯员反映的情况是事实，批评是正确的，你看了中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定没有？”他即转移话头，说：
    “我希望你们要注意通讯员的历史背景，不要认为他们全都可靠。”但沙至今对报上的批评没有答复。
    “三反”以后，他在市委帮助下，曾作了检讨，据说他在认识上也有某些改进，但他的错误思想并未得到根本解决。因而运输部至今仍缺乏民主空气。一九五二年七月，鞍山市总工会组织科长来信批评运输部随便开除工人。稿件发表后，报社三次打电话催运输部答复，沙友石均置之不理。报社又接到运输部工人来信对开除工人提出意见，报社又派人拿上信去找沙。沙看了信后便质问他：是谁写的稿子？你知不知道读者是干什么的？是什么样子？最后气愤愤地说：“我不管你们的事。”把袖子一甩，便扬长而去。上述这些批评，直到现在也没有在报上公开答复。一九五二年十月，大型轧钢厂建筑工地木工队劳动模范苏兴元曾写信给报社，抗议运输部执法队长无故扣押赵盛林和苏兴元的犯法行为。编辑部把这封信印成内部参考材料，送给市委、公司以及运输部。到现在已有四个月，运输部并没有负责处理。
    第二个是炼钢厂厂长马成德。他对批评者曾经采取了报复和打击的手段。“工人生活”报通讯员曹永魁（老工人）是炼钢厂铸锭车间的副主任，也是一个积极的社会活动分子。他曾经批评该厂不重视职工福利，发放保护品不及时，以及领导方面（这里并没有直接指名）擅自决定用国家钢材料和人工给该厂修理分场长的小孩做小车。对于前者，该厂技术保安科只是强调困难，作了一个敷衍的答复。对于后者，马成德说：“你们批评是不对的，我不仅给修理分场长小孩做了小车，还给副厂长小孩也做了一个，我厂长有权利批准。”从此以后，马成德对曹永魁便抱了成见。在一次会上，马对曹说：“你能够写稿到报纸上批评领导，你自己的车间有缺点，你为什么不去批评一下自己？”据曹永魁说，像这样的冷讽热刺，马成德对他已不止一次。以后，曹永魁气闷不过，便对报社同志说：“我再也不写稿了，受不了这种打击。”报社把这个情况写成书面材料准备在报上发表，提交市委审查。当时的前任市委书记杨春茂未加可否，便把这个材料转给马成德，叫他检查有无其事。马接到材料后，立刻到党委办公室（当时“工人生活”报有两个记者也在办公室），一进门，便把信一摔说：“这还了得，曹永魁竟干了些什么！”他向党委书记说：“我建议立刻召开党委会议研究这个问题。”当时就召开了党委会议。会上多数人认为：曹永魁的批评是不正确的，他不服从领导，工作消极，要给以处分。会议开到最后，只有党委委员陈杰提出怀疑说：“这样处理恐不妥当，这不成了压制批评了吗？”此后，报社催问市委，仍无结果，便不了了之。曹永魁的问题不但没有解决，曹永魁和报社的关系在基本上是断绝了。他至今仍不敢“写批评稿”。一九五一年六月，报社记者批评炼钢厂生产领导方面的缺点，报社派记者去请马成德审查稿件，事前并用电话约好。记者去后，他生气地说：“我不看！”记者只好交给党委书记看。稿子发表后，马成德至今并无任何答复。报社又收到一位技术员徐鼎钰写的批评炼钢厂钢锭质量不好及不遵守技术规程的信，报社转给马成德，后被“丢失”。半个月后还是在他那里找到了。
    在伟大的“三反”运动中，市委派了很多干部帮助马成德解决思想问题，用了一个多月的功夫，马才做了较为全面的检讨。“三反”运动以后，马成德改变了骂人的态度。但据记者多方调查，马成德对依靠党依靠工人阶级等问题尚没有从思想上求得解决。这也就是为什么在“三反”以后他仍不能按照中共中央在报纸上展开批评和自我批评的决定在报纸上公开进行检讨的主要原因。
    第三是鞍山钢铁公司住宅工程处政治处主任胡仁寿等压制和打击批评的恶劣行为。一九五二年十一月中旬，“工人生活”报先后接到立山住宅工程处通讯员赵启谅（笔名赵力）、赵慕孔（笔名铁锋）的两次来信，批评该处材料科违反劳动法令屡次强迫工人加班加点。报社调查证明符合事实，于去年十一月三十日在报纸上提出批评。但住宅工程处有些领导干部，在报纸批评后四十天的时间不表示任何态度。他们反而对写稿人进行报复。在一月三日进行民主补课时，支部书记李宜奎就批评赵写稿“不经过支部审阅是无组织无纪律”。并追问他“写稿子为什么不写真名。”还说报纸登出批评后，“影响了材料科工作人员的情绪。”政治处主任兼总支副书记胡仁寿认为赵启谅是“先斩后奏”。政治处另一负责人杨明英同志也认为赵写稿子批评材料科是：
    “工会拿行政当资本家来斗。”赵启谅受到打击后，即将情况反映给报社。报社派记者前往调查，证实该处领导方面确有压制批评的行为，当即向该工程处陈经理（总支书记）和胡仁寿提出意见，他们不但不承认有压制批评的行为，并说“稿件有夸大事实的地方。”“因加班加点有病的工人没有那么多。”记者问他们究竟有多少工人有病，他们又说不出一个具体数字。一月十二日“工人生活”报记者拿着材料去和胡仁寿交换意见时，胡虽然承认有这些事实，却不承认有压制批评的行为。他说：“你们愿意登报就登报，我们还可以登人民日报去。”同时对赵启谅更进一步施以报复，他们认为赵把他们压制批评的行为向报社反映，是“思想不老实”；在讨论赵启谅转党问题时，还追查“写稿为什么不用真名？”“写稿为什么不通过支部审阅？”一月十二日机关支部大会讨论赵启谅的转党问题时，李宜奎首先代表支部宣布不同意赵启谅转党。胡仁寿在支部大会上给赵提出四条意见，其中有两条都是对赵写批评稿的意见。他说赵写批评稿不经过组织审查是“个人英雄主义”；说赵对民主补课“认识不明确”，“大家在民主补课中对他写批评稿提出的意见不但不接受，还派人到报社取原稿对抗。……”并再次质问赵“写稿批评材料科的动机”。
    “工人生活”报在一月十五日发表了“住宅工程处某些领导干部，缺乏民主作风压制批评”后，市委纪律检查委员会和基本建设政治部即派人到该处进行检查。检查人员初步检查后，为了取得认识上的一致，在一月十七日和胡仁寿交换意见，胡当场不但不承认事实，反而大发雷霆，说：“你们这个检查不是为了治病救人，而是为了找小脚。要按你们检查的材料，我们这些人该杀头啦！”并说：“民主补课、转党、登报问题应该分开来看，如果你们联在一起就加重了我们的错误。”杨明英同志还向报社说：对赵启谅写批评稿不经过组织审查提出批评，
    “不算是压制民主”，是“报社压制他们民主”。
    现在，胡仁寿已初步认识了自己的错误，但对于党员干部向报社写稿和反映情况不经过支部审查的问题仍表示怀疑的态度，认为在内部能解决的问题是“不应该登报”的。对报纸的批评至今也没有作公开而诚恳的答复。
    第四个是鞍山市人民政府人民法院院长范文采。去年十一月三十日在鞍山“工人生活”报上曾发表过立山私营企业工会委员会主席李树贤的一封来信。来信中揭发了鞍山市人民法院因为他检举资方，无理传审他，“如不按时到庭，便依法逮捕”的旧司法作风。来信中还指出，他按时到铁东区人民法庭后，等了很久，又无人知道“什么案件”，才又转到市人民法院。他到市人民法院又等了很久，才查出是因为检举立山兴鞍铁工厂资方拖欠工人工资事件。可是，法院并没有传审被检举的资方，而法院传达室的人还蛮横地对李说：“无事不传你，传你就有事，叫你怎的你就怎的。”这封读者来信刊出后，范文采就质问报社总编辑：“你们批评错了怎么办？”接着，他又打电话给报社读者来信组说：
    “请你们来人，我们要检查一下谁对谁不对。要在
    一起对一下情况，要写批评稿的人也来。”报社同志回答：“我们去是可以的，让写稿的人也去不合道理。”范说：“我们不是打击，只是对情况。”读者来信组长去后，看到范态度十分不好，表示报纸不该批评法院。报社同志说：“你们不应该像传犯人一样地传检举人。”范说：“我们法院对什么人都是一个传票，过去就是这样的。你们报社认为不好，能把我们的传票改改？”谈到不应该把人传来又忘记询问，教检举人白等了半天时，法院的其他负责干部也不同意这个批评。经过争执，范文采才勉强承认不对，但又表示：“批评虽是对的，但我们法院的大问题比这个还要多得多。”以后又经过再三催问，才答复说：“我院对司法用纸的改进上，仍不够重视。……至于该案的主办人员及传达室的人，都在司法改革运动中深刻地检查了自己的旧司法工作作风”。这就是说：鞍山市人民法院并没有什么官僚主义，只不过是“对司法用纸的改进上，仍不够重视”而已。可是李树贤对“该案的主办人员及传达室的人”的批评，并不是在司法改革运动之前，而是在司法改革运动之后，怎样能够把两个不同的时间强拉在一起呢？
    市委组织部副部长申东黎同志对于报纸批评他的妻子苏东一事，认为是“不公正不真实的”。可是，这个批评稿的真实性到底如何呢？报社为此曾召集了妇联的党、行政、青年团的干部座谈，征求对批评稿的意见。大家一致认为批评是对的，只有一处说苏东是党支部书记应改为“过去曾是党支部书记”。大家当场对苏东的错误行为又补充了不少新的意见和材料，送交市委。报社还再次征求了直属党委书记雷克的意见。雷克完全同意报纸的批评，并向市委提供了一些新的材料。市委并没有重视这些意见。各方面的意见尽管是这样的一致，但申东黎却要求公开发表苏东的更正信。他认为“批评妇联的工作及批评妇联党委书记（按：指苏东）的稿件，不应由直属党委审查，而应由市委审查为好。”并且说：“我是市委委员之一，比记者了解的情况多些，但你们并没有接受我的一点意见，我们的报纸是代表市委说话的，不是代表一个记者、一个编辑说话的。”最后他认为不允许苏东“申诉”，“就是不合理的，是反常的”。并一再地提出：“苏东给报社编辑部的信是符合事实的”，因为“给我看过”，所以“应该刊出”。苏东在他的影响下，至今仍没有作检讨。
    为什么对抗拒批评者不能展开斗争
    鞍山“工人生活”报自下而上的公开批评，为什么长时间开展不好？除“工人生活”报编辑部缺乏坚持斗争的勇气外，另一最大的原因，就是鞍山市委没有严肃地领导并支持报纸批评，没有对抗拒批评者展开斗争，甚至对报纸批评，有着错误的认识。有些人认为“在内部作了检讨或是作了一些批评也就算了”，因而忽视了按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”在报纸上进行批评。一九五一年十月八日市委书记韩天石给报社的信，对于在报纸上开展批评，是起了限制作用的。信的全文是：
    “××同志：最近‘工人生活’登载批评文字很不少。我认为必须慎重从事，因此在登载前应履行以下手续：
    1、批评科长以下工作干部和工人时，应经厂矿党委书记和厂长审阅，公司须经各该处长和人事处长审阅，市政府系统须经各该局和人事局审阅，如有不同意见须经市委批准。
    2、批评处长、厂矿长、局长、工程师、党委书记、工会主席、青年团书记以上干部时，应经市委批准。
    其次，一个时期内（如一月）批评文字不得超过表扬文字，件数不能超过三分之二到二分之一。
    再次，应有目的进行批评，应根据当前的具体任务和要求，如在目前应批评不重视依靠工人阶级思想，在完成任务中未发动群众，未发挥潜力等等。
    不能遇事批评，来信照登。”
    这封信发出时的背景是：在前十天的市委扩大会议上，一些抗拒批评的人像沙友石、马成德等人利用给市委提意见的机会，纷纷责备报社。沙友石说：“‘工人生活’报的批评稿百分之八十不正确。”要求市委对报社“多加领导”。市委会议对于这些意见采取了默认和容忍的态度。参加会议的报社同志回去后，感到委屈、泄气，认为“报纸搞批评挨了骂”“不批评为好，少批评为妙。”及至收到这封信后，全编辑部的思想越发混乱了。报社负责同志曾写信给韩天石同志提出不同意的意见，得到的回信说：“我说在批评某一单位的工作时，要征求该单位负责同志的意见——并不是要他批准。这是因为我们了解情况更全面些，下面同志的意见要听，再听听领导同志的意见不更好吗？这样做与中央的决定会有什么抵触呢？这样做会有什么坏处呢？……”
    据说韩天石写这两封信的动机是要求报纸慎重地进行批评。但，他却没有估计到某些抗拒批评者的恶劣行为所造成的严重情况，没有热情地领导批评、支持批评和为批评创造条件，树立对待批评的正确的和诚恳的榜样；相反的，他却提出了一些不正确的或是不符合实际情况的意见。市委宣传部对于鞍山“工人生活”报的领导是薄弱的，有时甚至放弃了领导。当然“工人生活”报就只能办成“看不看都可以”的报纸了。
    所谓“慎重从事”，是完全必要的。根据鞍山“工人生活”报进行批评的情况，他们不是慎重的太少，而是太多了。他们把群众的批评信件拿给被批评的人去看，对某些人进行批评要经过多次调查，要经过几个市委委员审查，他们在批评受到阻难后写材料一再请求市委处理抗拒批评问题，他们把群众的批评编成内部参考文件，供给领导同志参考。这一切都是何等“慎重”！然而这样的“慎重”，却没有能够改变抗拒批评的人的态度。从一九五○年中共中央发布“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”到现在，报纸上共发表五百六十五篇大大小小的批评稿件，全部批评稿件基本上都是正确的，完全失实或大部失实的没有一件。而在这五百六十五篇批评稿中，被批评者拒不答复的竟达二百九十三篇。难道能用“慎重从事”来感动抗拒批评的人吗？
    “工人生活”报“批评文字很不少”，下面的统计数字是可以回答这个问题的。首先，从一九五○年四月中共中央发布“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”以后、报纸历年发表的批评稿件数字来看：从一九五○年五月到十二月的七个月中共发表批评稿件一百四十一篇，一九五一年全年共发表批评稿件三百一十六篇，一九五二年（这时该报改成隔日刊）全年总共只发表了一百零八篇。一九五二年全年发表的批评稿件尚不及一九五○年七个月的多。其次，批评的内容大致可分为三种：对各单位领导干部的批评，对干部作风的批评，工人之间的相互批评。在这三类批评中，以第一类的批评对工作推动作用最大，但是，这一类的批评是每况愈下的。一九五○年五月到十二月发表了五十四篇，一九五一年全年发表了一百三十四篇，一九五二年全年则降至四十篇。工作中有缺点不让群众知道好呢？还是多吸引群众来监督好呢？请听一听马林科夫的话吧：“在消灭我们工作中的缺点时吸收的群众越多，对我们一切组织的活动的自下而上的监督越强，我们在各种领域里的工作就越顺利。”
    “在报纸上发表的批评稿件要有一个数量上的限制”。事实上，鞍山“工人生活”报批评最活泼时期，批评稿在数量上也从来没有超过整个报纸篇幅的八分之一，四年来只有一期占了整个报纸四分之一的篇幅。问题的关键显然不在于规定表扬和批评稿件的比例，而在于领导者热情地领导批评，不要把批评看成是消极的、同自己的领导工作为难的东西。对于共产党来说，自下而上的批评是带动千百万群众的自发创造性和主动性的表现，是工人阶级对祖国崇高的主人翁的责任感。我们“坚持真理，修正错误”，这就是我们生命的源泉。
    “规定一定时期的批评任务”，作为领导上注意的重点是可以的，但绝不能因此而限制报纸批评。批评应当是全党的日常工作，不应当把批评限制在一定范围内进行。不管是中心工作也好，一般工作也好，我们对于一切不健康的现象和缺点，都应该举起批评的武器进行斗争。
    “不能来信照登”，这对不对呢？据统计，鞍山“工人生活”报登出来的读者来信，最多的时候也没有超过全部来信的百分之十。把全部来信照登是不可能的，也是不必要的。但是，党和党报对于每一封来信都必须十分重视。鞍山“工人生活”报最大的缺点不是“来信照登”，而是“来信照转”，他们不加任何有效的监督就转到“有关机关”去办理。很多来信是应该公开提到群众面前来解决的，却被积压在机关办公室的一边无人理睬了。工人们的来信，有的反映了非常重要的问题，但也有很小的问题，甚至有的是“遇事批评”的。党和党报的责任就是不要轻视和放过这些小事，“大事情往往是小事情的基础”。要把工人们的信像列宁所说的当作政治文件来看，用最尊重的态度来处理他们。这是党依靠工人阶级相信群众的重要标志之一。
    像这样显然是没有经过慎重考虑的信，能够由市委发给报社，说明鞍山市委内部是缺乏原则性的。韩天石同志在他第二次信中所说：“对情况不够了解”，但那时他调来鞍山已近两个月，同时其他看过这封信的市委委员是了解实际情况的。但他们却采取了自由主义的态度，有的人表示同意签字批准，有的人看了信认为“不对头”，但并没有在市委会议上按照中央的精神正式提出意见，开展批评和自我批评。这是一个值得记取的教训。
    今后怎样解决鞍山“工人生活”报展开批评的问题
    经过伟大的“三反”运动，鞍山的工作是有着进展的，党的领导水平和干部思想觉悟程度是逐渐提高了；但也必须承认，从鞍山“工人生活”报所反映出的问题来看，鞍山市委对于在报纸上展开自下而上的批评这一个原则问题是认识不足的，许多看法是落后于现实，甚至是不正确的。因此，今后要彻底解决鞍山“工人生活”报大力展开公开批评的问题。鞍山市委必须进一步加强对报纸的领导，按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，以身作则地对于在报纸上展开批评的问题，作深入的检查，并在全市各单位，认真展开反对官僚主义，反对强迫命令，反对违法乱纪的斗争；有领导地支持报纸上的自下而上的批评，坚决彻底地清除一切抗拒、压制批评的现象；对于那些曾经被报纸批评而没有认真向群众作负责的交代或是抗拒批评的人，党的组织有责任帮助并指令他们在报纸上进行公开的诚恳的检讨；对于错误严重的人，应作适当的处理，借以挽回在群众中已经造成的不良影响。
