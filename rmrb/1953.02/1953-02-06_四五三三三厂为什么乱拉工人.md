    Why Factory 45333 Randomly Recruited Workers

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper criticized Factory 45333 on January 8 for randomly recruiting construction workers, the Fourth Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government immediately convened a bureau director's meeting to seriously discuss this issue, and on January 9, it sent an investigation team to Factory 45333 to investigate. The investigation results proved that the newspaper's criticism was completely in line with the facts. Published here are the self-criticisms of the bureau director and the factory director of Factory 45333 regarding this matter.
    After the People's Daily criticized Factory 45333 on January 8 for randomly recruiting construction workers, we immediately discussed this issue seriously at a bureau director's meeting and sent an investigation team to Factory 45333 on January 9. According to the investigation, the Party newspaper's criticism was completely correct.
    The main reason why Factory 45333 randomly recruited construction workers was that the leading cadres of the factory had a serious task-oriented viewpoint and lacked policy thinking and an overall perspective. When the factory's Party committee studied the work of recruiting workers, it proposed "not to recruit workers from the Beijing Construction Company," but only because they were afraid of damaging relations, without realizing that this was a policy issue. Zhao Pinshan, the factory director of the factory, told the comrades responsible for recruiting workers in general terms: "Be bold in accepting [workers], complete the task, and I will be responsible if problems arise!" Before recruiting workers, Bi Min, the deputy section chief of the capital construction section responsible for this work, proposed recruiting workers with wages 10 percent higher than those of the Beijing Construction Company. The leading cadres of the factory actually agreed to this opinion, which violated policy. When the factory wrote a report to our bureau, the labor and wages section of our bureau did not criticize it, but instead drafted another report to the Second Ministry of Machine Building based on the Northeast standard, proposing a wage increase. This report was not approved, and Bi Min then proposed to Factory Director Zhao Pinshan: "If wages are not increased, can we take care of welfare?" "The Beijing Construction Company and other units are not well managed. After they are disbanded, we can recruit some workers." These incorrect opinions were not criticized either. When the Beijing Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of factory Party committees to report on their work, it criticized the factory for not recruiting workers from the Beijing Construction Company and instructed the factory to conduct a review. On December 28 last year, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau recruited workers from the Beijing Construction Company for the factory and directly consulted with Comrade Bi Min, but this did not attract the factory's attention. At the end of the recruitment work, the factory held a meeting and praised Bi Min's work achievements, which further fueled Bi Min's illegal and undisciplined behavior.
    Bi Min believed that "recruitment is difficult if wages are not increased and welfare is not taken care of." Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, the wages of the workers recruited were generally and unreasonably increased. For example, Du Hongling, Du Baoming, and others were originally temporary workers at the Beijing Construction Company and are now changed from temporary worker level to the same level of permanent workers; some workers reported one or two grades higher when reporting their grade; some ordinary workers reported themselves as technicians; the factory did not review any of this. The workers said: "This place is better than the Beijing Construction Company. We say how much, and they give us how much." Factory cadres Jin Shengze and Hu Yun told the workers: "We will pay you money according to the highest wages of the Beijing Construction Company." Zhao Hongru told the workers: "Next year (i.e., this year) in the second half of the year, you will be given a room, a table, a chair, and coal, and you will be treated as soldiers."
    The factory's random wage increases and recruitment of workers have created a phenomenon of worker mobility and disrupted the state's plan for fixed workers. Therefore, the factory's mistakes are extremely serious.
    We should also bear some responsibility for the mistakes made by Factory 45333. When we assigned tasks to the factory, we only emphasized the need to let go of recruitment and resolutely complete the tasks; but we did not clearly explain the policies, guidelines, and discipline that should be observed during recruitment. At the same time, this incident also reflects that we have a serious bureaucratic work style, with only assignments and no inspections. We did not know about the factory's violation of policies and random recruitment of workers until it was publicly criticized by the Party newspaper. In addition, there is also a lack of organizational discipline among our bureau's cadres. For example, after the labor and wages section received the report from Factory 45333 requesting an increase in wages to facilitate the recruitment of construction workers, it drafted a report to the Second Ministry of Machine Building based on the Northeast standard without the consent of the bureau director. This shows that the leadership, control, and inspection of capital construction work by the leading cadres of our bureau are extremely insufficient and must be corrected in the future.
    In addition to the above self-criticism, we have decided to take the following measures to deal with this issue: First, ensure that all construction workers recruited by improper means are returned to their original units. Second, conduct ideological reviews from the bureau to the factory, from top to bottom, to improve the ideological level and leadership thinking of cadres and overcome the still-existing "specialization" and localism. Third, Bi Min's ideological style is extremely bad, violating policies and undermining discipline, and it has been decided to give him the punishment of dismissal; the factory's leading cadres and other relevant cadres should make profound self-criticisms.

    四五三三三厂为什么乱拉工人
    中央第二机械工业部第四局局长  王西萍  副局长  段子俊  范铭
    编者按：一月八日本报批评了四五三三三厂乱拉建筑工人以后，中央人民政府第二机械工业部第四局即召开局长会议，严肃地讨论这个问题，并于一月九日派调查小组去四五三三三厂调查。调查结果证明本报的批评是完全合乎事实的。这里发表的是该局局长和四五三三三厂厂长对于这件事的检讨。
    一月八日人民日报批评四五三三三厂乱拉建筑工人之后，我们即在局长会议上严肃地讨论了这个问题，并于一月九日派调查小组去四五三三三厂调查。根据调查的情况，证实党报的批评完全正确。
    四五三三三厂乱拉建筑工人的主要原因，是该厂领导干部存在着严重的单纯任务观点，缺乏政策思想和整体观念。该厂党委研究招收工人工作时，曾提出“不要招北京市建筑公司的工人”，但只是怕弄坏关系，而不知道这是政策问题。该厂赵品三厂长笼统地向招收工人的同志们说：“要大胆接收，完成任务，出了问题我负责！”在招收工人之前，负责这一工作的基本建设科副科长毕敏曾提出以比北京市建筑公司多百分之十的工资来招收工人。该厂领导干部居然同意了这个违反政策的意见。该厂向我局写报告时，我局劳动工资处也未给以批判，反按照东北标准，另拟了一个提高工资的报告送第二机械工业部。此报告未获批准，毕敏就又向赵品三厂长提出：“工资不提，福利是否可以照顾？”“北京市建筑公司等单位管理不好，等他们解散后，我们可以招收一部分工人。”这些不正确的意见也未受到批判。中共北京市委在召集工厂党委汇报时，曾批评该厂不该招收北京市建筑公司的工人，并指示该厂要进行检查。去年十二月二十八日，北京市劳动局为该厂拉了北京市建筑公司的工人，曾直接与毕敏同志商谈，但都未引起该厂注意。该厂在招收工作告一段落时，曾召开过一次会议，在会上还表扬了毕敏的工作成绩，从而更助长了毕敏的违法乱纪行为。
    毕敏认为：“工资不提高，福利不照顾，招收困难。”在这种错误思想的指导下，所招收的工人的工资，普遍地不合理地提高了。如杜洪岺、杜保明等原为北京市建筑公司临时工，现以临时工等级变为同等级长期工；有的工人自报等级时高报了一、二级；有的普通工自报技工；该厂都没审查。工人说：“这里比北京市建筑公司好，我们说多少，就给多少。”该厂干部金盛泽、胡云对工人说：“我们以北京市建筑公司最高的工资给你们发钱。”赵洪儒向工人说：“明年（即今年）下半年给一间房子，一张桌子，一把椅子，还有煤，并按军人待遇。”
    该厂随便提高工资乱拉工人，造成了建筑工人的流动现象，打乱了国家固定工人的计划。因此，该厂的错误是极其严重的。
    四五三三三厂所犯的错误，我们也应负一定的责任。我们给该厂布置任务时，只强调了放手招收工人，坚决完成任务；但对在招收时应该遵守的政策方针和纪律则交代得不够明确。同时，这件事也反映了我们存在着严重的官僚主义作风，工作只有布置，没有检查。该厂违犯政策乱拉工人的情况，在被党报公开批评以前，我们都不了解。此外，在我局干部中也存在着无组织无纪律的思想作风。如劳动工资处接到四五三三三厂为便利招收建筑工人呈请增加工资的报告之后，不经过局长同意，即另以东北标准拟定增加工资之报告送第二机械工业部。这说明了我们局的领导干部对基本建设工作的领导、掌握、检查是极其不够的，今后必须改正。
    除作上述的检讨外，我们决定以如下的措施处理这个问题：一、保证将以不正当的手段招来的建筑工人，一律退回原单位。二、从局到厂，自上而下地进行思想检查，藉以提高干部的思想水平和领导思想水平，克服目前仍旧存在的“特殊化”的本位主义思想。三、毕敏的思想作风极其恶劣，违犯政策，破坏纪律，决定给予撤职处分；该厂领导干部与其他有关干部应作深刻检讨。
