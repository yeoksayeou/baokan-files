Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: Matsumoto Jiichiro, a renowned Japanese peace advocate who was invited by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to visit our country, issued the following written statement upon his arrival in Beijing on the 25th:

	I have come here to fulfill the duties incumbent upon me as the Vice-Chairman of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee.

	I was originally scheduled to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing last October as the head of the Japanese delegation. However, due to obstruction by the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, I was unable to participate in the conference, which I deeply regret.

	The reactionary Yoshida government, colluding with American imperialism, fears the expansion of the Japanese peace movement and fears that the Japanese people will unite firmly with the people of Asian countries to strive for peace. Therefore, it refused to issue passports to the Japanese delegation elected by the people.

	We immediately filed a lawsuit against the Yoshida reactionary government's unconstitutional act of depriving people of their freedom to travel, preparing to fight in court. However, the court, also serving the reactionary ruling class, rejected our lawsuit.

	Because of this twist, many of our representatives were unable to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. However, several of our representatives overcame all obstacles and difficulties to attend the conference. As the head of the delegation, nothing could make me feel more gratified than this. I feel that because of the courage of these representatives, they were able to fulfill some of the responsibilities borne by the Japanese delegation. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference gave me, who failed to fulfill the duties of the head of the delegation, the glorious position of Vice-Chairman of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee. Now, I have come here to fulfill this glorious duty.

	China and Japan are only a little over seven hundred kilometers apart. Nevertheless, we had to travel dozens of times farther than this to get here. Despite the highly developed transportation tools of today, it is truly an unnecessary detour. However, this is the route we had to take due to the obstruction of the Yoshida reactionary government. We met comrades in Burma, India, Czechoslovakia, and other countries who are fighting for peace, received their warm welcome, and had the opportunity to encourage and inspire each other, which was a great gain.

	At the same time, I must deeply thank the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, headed by Madam Soong Ching Ling, and its Secretary-General, Mr. Liu Ningyi, and comrades engaged in the peace movement in various places for their sincere assistance. Thanks to their dedicated assistance, I was able to travel such a long distance without hindrance and arrive here safely.

	Because Mr. Hirano Yoshitaro, Mr. Hatanaka Masaharu, and other gentlemen arrived in Beijing before us, I think they have already reported in detail on the recent situation of the Japanese peace movement. In the future, I would like to talk carefully with the Japanese representatives under the leadership of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee to fulfill my responsibilities in resolving current problems and establishing fundamental issues of Asian peace.

    松本治一郎发表书面谈话
    【新华社二十五日讯】应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会邀请来我国访问的日本著名和平人士松本治一郎，在二十五日抵达北京时，发表书面谈话如下：
    我是为了要完成亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副主席所应负的任务而来到此地的。
    我原定以日本代表团团长的资格出席去年十月在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，但是，由于遭到日本吉田反动政府的阻挠，没有能够参加会议，深感遗憾。
    和美帝国主义勾结在一起的吉田反动政府害怕日本的和平运动扩展开来，害怕日本人民为了争取和平与亚洲各国人民坚强地团结起来，所以，才拒绝发给被人民推选出来的日本代表团的出国护照。
    我们对于吉田反动政府这种剥夺旅行自由的违反宪法的行为，立刻办理起诉手续，准备在法庭上进行斗争，但是，同样为反动的统治阶级服务的裁判所竟驳回了我们的起诉书。
    因为发生了这样的波折，使得我们的许多代表未能出席在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。但是，我们的几位代表突破了一切阻挠和困难，出席了会议。对于身为团长的我来说，再没有比这件事更能使我感觉欣慰的了。我觉得，由于这几位代表的勇敢，才能够完成了日本代表团所担负的一些责任。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于未能完成团长职责的我，竟给予亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副主席的光荣职务。现在，我是为了完成这个光荣的职责而来到此地的。
    中国和日本相距不过七百多公里。尽管如此，我们却不能不绕了比这要远几十倍的长途，才能够来到此地。尽管说现在交通工具非常发达，实在不能不说这是走了冤枉的道路。可是，这也是由于吉田反动政府的阻挠而不得不采取的路线。我们在缅甸、印度、捷克斯洛伐克等国，见到正在为争取和平而斗争的同志们，受到他们热烈的欢迎，得到互相慰勉鼓舞的机会，却是一个极大的收获。
    同时，我必须深深感谢以宋庆龄先生为首的亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会及其秘书长刘宁一先生和各地从事和平运动的同志们的竭诚援助，由于他们的尽心援助，我才能绕了这样远的道路而毫无阻碍地安然来到了此地。
    因为平野义太郎、畑中政春等各位先生比我们先到北京，我想他们已经详细报告了关于日本和平运动的近况。今后我想在亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会的领导之下，和日本的各位代表好好地谈一谈，在解决当前的各种问题和确立亚洲和平的根本问题方面，完成我所担负的职责。
