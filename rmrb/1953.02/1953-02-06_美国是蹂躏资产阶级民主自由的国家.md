The solemn ceremony of moving the original manuscript of the American "Declaration of Independence," which declared the basic principles of bourgeois democratic freedom in the United States 176 years ago, to the basement for storage was recently held in Washington. The original manuscript of the "Declaration" was moved from the Capitol to the National Archives and sealed in its basement.

President Truman's speech also emphasized this burial ceremony, saying it was "the saddest funeral in history."

In fact, the principles of the American Constitution were buried long ago. The reactionary American bourgeoisie is persecuting all progressives and all those who oppose the expansion of armaments and the destructive policies of inciting a new world war on an unprecedented scale.

Comrade Stalin said: "In the past, the bourgeoisie sang the praises of liberalism and defended the freedoms of bourgeois democracy, thereby building up its prestige among the people. Now, even the shadow of liberalism is gone. So-called 'individual freedom' no longer exists; now, only those who own capital are recognized as having individual rights, while all other citizens are regarded as mere human material fit for exploitation. The principles of equality among people and equality among nations have been trampled upon; these principles have been replaced by the principle that the exploiting minority enjoys full rights while the exploited majority of citizens has no rights. The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside."

Comrade Stalin's words are completely in line with the situation in the United States. On the one hand, the United States is preparing for a new war, and on the other hand, it is strengthening police persecution and the fascistization of the entire system. The American ruling group has promulgated many fascist decrees specifically designed to strangle civil rights and the freedom of ordinary Americans. The reactionary Taft-Hartley Act authorizes the government to arbitrarily interfere in the internal life of trade unions, restrict the right of trade unions to decide on working conditions, exclude Americans with progressive ideas from the leadership of trade unions, and so on.

The American reactionaries used the Smith Act to suppress progressives under the pretext of eliminating "activities hostile to the United States government." The American courts sanctioned the leaders of the American Communist Party based on this decree; many fighters for peace and democracy were thrown into prisons and concentration camps. A letter to Truman jointly published by 280 prominent Americans stated that the imprisonment of Communist leaders for their views "means that the American government's fear of the American people has reached the point where it cannot tolerate freedom of speech and political association."

One of the main weapons in the hands of the American reactionaries is the McCarran Act, which allows the police to persecute any individual or organization under the charge of "sabotage." The "Subversive Activities Control Board" established under this decree has the right to accuse anyone suspected of sympathizing with the progressive movement. With the same effect is the McCarran-Walter Act, which gives the American security agencies broad powers to arrest non-American citizens who oppose war and fascist policies. The American bourgeois organization "American Civil Liberties Union" recently issued a statement saying that the McCarran Act and the McCarran-Walter Act risk abolishing the constitutional rights of American citizens because they authorize the Justice Department to "search and throw thousands upon thousands of people into concentration camps across the country."

In order to suppress the progressive movement, the American reactionaries are conducting extensive "loyalty" investigations of civil servants. In the last five years alone, three million people have been subjected to this humiliating investigation, and four thousand people have lost their jobs and social status due to the tip-offs and slanders of police special agents.

American local authorities also adopted the federal government's special agent methods to deal with people who defend peace and democracy. Some states in the United States have implemented "loyalty oath" laws. Anyone who refuses to take the oath will lose their job. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Black, in referring to Oklahoma's "oath" law, had to admit that the decree was a "weapon of tyranny," "its purpose is to suppress and control people's thoughts."

The main agencies for suppressing the progressive movement and cultivating fascism are the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House Un-American Activities Committee. They have acquired the right to interfere in agencies, enterprises, schools, radio stations, movies, and theaters. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have been interrogated by them. The names of millions of Americans are on the FBI's blacklist and are constantly monitored by the bureau's agents. Anyone suspected of being "unreliable" by the FBI and the "Un-American Activities Committee" will be subjected to severe police suppression.

Agents, with the help of spy networks and reporting systems, brazenly intrude into the private lives of ordinary Americans, search their letters, monitor their friends, check the newspapers they read, eavesdrop on their phone calls, disguise themselves to attend their family celebrations, and secretly tail them. Agency staff monitor their colleagues, waiters and salespeople monitor their customers, landlords monitor their tenants, and even children in some families monitor their parents. For example, the local authorities in Buffalo forced elementary school students to monitor their parents and report "saboteurs" to the FBI. The "Nation" magazine complained: "It's always worrying to associate with people, because you don't know if you've inadvertently complained a little, whether a neighbor will report it to the secret police."

Every American who the FBI feels has "suspicious" behavior, who accidentally says something, is in danger of being visited by the police. Biddle, in his book "The Fear of Freedom," mentioned some examples: a female teacher offended the authorities simply because she believed that her students should acquire a minimum knowledge of the Soviet Union. Another American was charged because someone in his residence sang a Russian song. The third person committed an even greater "crime": he began to learn Russian.

In modern America, the spearhead of police persecution is directed at those who fight for the rights of workers and those who dare to oppose the policy of preparing for war and support peace and international friendship. Former Senator S. Nowak said after traveling around the country that local authorities had made every effort to obstruct the holding of peace conferences. Not only the organizers of the conference, but also the participants were intimidated and even dismissed from their jobs.

The American reactionaries declared that they would launch a "crusade" against progressive literature. The American Association Bulletin reported on "hundreds upon hundreds of incidents": reactionaries banned, censored, or destroyed books and textbooks they considered to be "destructive" and "anti-American." "The Nation" magazine wrote: "The authorities want to ban not only books written by those who advocate social reform, but often even books that simply criticize our business practices are inevitably banned." The authorities prohibit the import of literary books and magazines that Wall Street does not like. They confiscate packages containing progressive literature, steal books, and bankrupt booksellers.

Police tyranny has also penetrated American universities. After visiting seventy-two universities and colleges in New York, reporters reported that an atmosphere of stalking and terror pervades these schools. Agents from the FBI and the "Un-American Activities Committee" regularly stalk professors and students. The "New York Times" said that students are deeply troubled by the fact that they are not allowed to use words such as "peace," "freedom," and "liberalism" in their speech. A report by the "National Education Association" stated that thirty states are now conducting "loyalty" investigations of teachers, "and the reluctance to participate in debates and the fear among teachers are increasing." Many teachers and professors have lost their jobs due to police repression.

The attack by the reactionaries and the terrorist actions of the fascist security agencies have left human rights in the dollar empire completely destroyed. American progressive Corliss Lamont, in an article on American "democracy," cited many facts to illustrate the destruction of the rights and freedoms of American citizens. Lamont wrote: "Never before in American history has the freedom of Americans been so massively damaged and destroyed as it is now. ... American citizens cannot loudly oppose the currently dominant ideology or voluntarily participate in any organization without risking sacrificing their constitutional rights, their reputation, their livelihood, and their fate, without risking punishment and imprisonment."

The reactionary guys in the American courts are trying to deprive Americans of the right to defense. American courts have become so arbitrary that American lawyers dare not defend those accused of political issues. Since the lawyers who defended in the trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party were imprisoned, none of the eighty lawyers in Pittsburgh dared to defend Nelson, the leader of the American Communist Party in the area, whose crime was engaging in activities to defend peace and workers' rights.

In the territory of Wall Street, not only individuals but entire nations are subjected to police persecution. The status of fifteen million black people without any rights is the most prominent example, they are victims of racial discrimination and brutal terror.

In the United States, only those who have capital have individual rights and freedoms. They have the right to exploit workers without restriction, and they have the full freedom to extract huge profits from the blood, sweat, and suffering of millions of ordinary people.

The American monopoly capitalists have ruthlessly trampled on the remnants of bourgeois democratic freedom that they boast about every day, and are trying to dedicate the lives and activities of millions upon millions of people to their selfish purposes. The reactionary American bourgeoisie has thrown the tattered fragments of the American Constitution into the latrine, and they want the American people to forget their rights and freedoms. But this vicious conspiracy of the American gendarmes has been met with increasingly resolute resistance from the American working people who are fighting for peace, democratic rights, and freedom.

    美国是蹂躏资产阶级民主自由的国家
    苏联  斯·别格洛夫
    一百七十六年前宣布美国资产阶级民主自由基本原则的美国“独立宣言”原稿移存地下室的隆重仪式，最近在华盛顿举行过了。“宣言”的原稿从国会移到国家文献保管处，封存在它的一个地下室里。
    美国总统杜鲁门的演说也强调这个埋葬仪式，他说这是“历史上最悲哀的葬仪”。
    事实上美国宪法的原则早就给埋葬了。美国反动资产阶级空前未有地迫害着一切进步分子，一切反对扩充军备和煽动新的世界大战的毁灭政策的人们。
    斯大林同志说：“从前，资产阶级高唱自由主义，维护资产阶级民主的自由，从而在人民中间为自己树立了声望。现在，连自由主义的影子也一点没有了。所谓‘个人自由’已经不再存在了，——现在，仅仅那些拥有资本的人们才被承认有个人权利，而其他的一切公民则被当作只适于供剥削的人料。人们平等和民族平等的原则被践踏了；这种原则已代之以从事剥削的少数人享有充分权利而公民中被剥削的大多数人则毫无权利的原则。资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。”
    斯大林同志这些话是完全符合美国的情况的。美国一方面准备新战争，一方面加强警察迫害和整个制度的法西斯化。美国统治集团颁布了许多法西斯法令，专门用来扼杀公民权利和普通美国人的自由。反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法授权政府横暴地干涉工会的内部生活，限制工会决定劳动条件的权利，把有进步思想的美国人从工会的领导机构中排挤出去，等等。
    美国反动派利用史密斯法，借口肃清“敌视美国政府的活动”，镇压进步分子。美国法院就是根据这个法令制裁了美国共产党的领导人；许多为和平与民主而斗争的战士被投入监狱和集中营。美国二百八十位著名人士联名发表的给杜鲁门的信说，共产党领袖因其见解而下狱，“意味着美国政府对美国人民的惧怕，已到了不能容忍言论和政治结社自由的地步”。
    美国反动派手中的主要武器之一是麦卡伦法，这个法令使警察可以用“破坏活动”的罪名迫害任何一个人和任何一个组织。根据这个法令建立的“破坏活动管制委员会”有权控告任何被怀疑同情进步运动的人。与此法有同样作用的是麦卡伦—华尔特法，该法给美国保安机关以广泛的权利，可以逮捕反对战争和法西斯政策的非美国籍公民。美国资产阶级组织“美国民权保障同盟”最近发表的声明说，麦卡伦法和麦卡伦—华尔特法有取消美国公民的宪法权利的危险，因为它们授权司法部“搜捕并把成千成万的人投入全国各地的集中营”。
    美国反动派为了镇压进步运动，对机关职员进行广泛的“忠诚”调查。仅最近五年以来就有三百万人受过这个侮辱性的调查，并有四千人因警察特务的告密和诬告，丧失了工作和社会地位。
    美国地方当局也采用联邦政府的特务手段对付维护和平与民主的人们。美国有些州实施了“忠诚宣誓”法。凡是拒绝宣誓的人就要丢掉工作。美国最高法院法官布莱克在谈到俄克拉何马州的“宣誓”法时，不得不承认，这个法令是“暴政的武器”，
    “它的目的是压抑和管制人的思想”。
    镇压进步运动和培植法西斯主义的主要机关是联邦调查局与众院“非美”活动调查委员会。它们取得干涉机关、企业、学校、电台、电影、戏院的权利。成千成万的美国人受到它们的讯问。千百万美国人的名字列在联邦调查局的黑名单上，受到该局特务的经常监视。凡是被联邦调查局和“非美”活动调查委员会怀疑“不可靠”的人都要遭到警察严厉的镇压。
    特务们借助于特务网和告密系统，横暴地打入普通美国人的私生活，搜查他们的信件，监视他们的朋友，检查他们阅读的报纸，偷听他们的电话，乔装参加他们的家庭喜庆，偷偷摸摸地钉他们的梢。机关工作人员监视着他们的同事，堂倌和卖东西的监视着他们的顾主，房东监视着他们的房客，有些家庭的孩子甚至监视着他们的父母。例如，布法罗的地方当局强迫小学生监视他们的父母，把
    “破坏分子”报告给联邦调查局。“民族”周刊诉苦说：“和人来往总是提心吊胆，因为你不知道，是否你无意之间发了些牢骚，会给邻居报告给秘密警察。”
    每一个美国人，凡是让联邦调查局觉得有“可怀疑的”行为，凡是偶然说了一句什么话，就有被警察光顾的危险。毕德尔在“对自由的恐怖”这本书中谈到一些例子：一个女教师得罪了当局，只因为她认为必须让她的学生获得对苏联的起码知识。另外一个美国人被控告了，因为他的住宅里有人唱俄文歌。第三个人犯的“罪”更大：他开始学俄文。
    在现代的美国，警察迫害的矛头指向那些为劳动者的权利而斗争的人，指向那些敢于反对准备战争政策，拥护和平与国际友好的人。前参议员斯·诺瓦克旅行全国回来后说，地方当局多方阻难和平会议的举行。不仅会议的组织者，而且会议的参加者都受到恐吓，甚至解除工作。
    美国反动派宣称要对进步文学发动“十字军征讨”。美国协会公报报道了“成千成百的事件”：反动派取缔、检查或销毁他们认为是“破坏的”和“反美国的”书籍和教科书辅助读物。“民族”周刊写道：“当局要禁止的不仅是那些主张社会改革的人写的书，而且往往只是批评我们商界习惯的书也免不了被禁止。”当局禁止华尔街不喜欢的文学书籍杂志进口。他们没收寄递进步文学的邮包，把书籍偷窃去，使书商破产。
    警察的横行霸道也深入美国的学府。纽约的记者访问七十二个大学和学院以后报道说：钉梢和恐怖的气氛笼罩着这些学校。联邦调查局和“非美”活动调查委员会的特务经常钉着教授和学生。“纽约时报”说，学生们对于不得在言谈中使用“和平”、“自由”、“自由主义”等字眼，深以为苦。“全国教育协会”的报道说，现在有三十个州进行着教员的“忠诚”调查，“教员中间不愿参加争论和惧怕的心理日见增长”。由于警察的压迫，许多教员和教授失掉了职业。
    反动派的进攻和法西斯保安机关的恐怖行动使得美元国度的人权摧残无遗。美国进步人士柯利斯·拉蒙特在论美国“民主”的文章中列举了许多事实说明美国公民的权利和自由遭到破坏的情形。拉蒙特写道：“美国人的自由像现在这般大规模地横遭损害和破坏，在美国历史上还找不到先例。……美国公民要大声疾呼反对目前占统治地位的思想或者自愿参加什么组织，没有不冒牺牲自己的宪法权利、自己的名誉、饭碗和自己的命运的危险的，没有不冒受惩罚和坐牢的危险的。”
    美国法院的反动家伙竭力剥夺美国人的辩护权利。美国法院竟专横到这种地步：美国的律师不敢为那些因政治问题而被控告的人进行辩护。自从在美共领袖审判中进行辩护的律师下狱以后，匹兹堡的八十个律师中没有一个人敢为该地美共领袖纳尔逊辩护了，他的罪名是从事维护和平与工人权利的活动。
    在华尔街的领地里，不仅单独的人，而且整个整个的民族都遭到警察的迫害。一千五百万黑人毫无权利的地位就是最显著的例子，他们是种族歧视和残酷恐怖的牺牲者。
    在美国有个人权利和自由的只是那些有资本的人。他们有毫无限制地剥削劳动者的权利，他们有从千百万老百姓的血汗和苦难中榨取庞大利润的充分自由。
    美国垄断资本家无情地践踏了他们成天夸耀的资产阶级民主自由的残余，竭力想使千千万万人的生命和活动都奉献给他们的自私的目的。美国的反动资产阶级已经把美国宪法的断简残篇扔进茅厕了，他们要美国人民忘掉自己的权利和自由。但是美国宪兵的这种恶毒的阴谋遭到为和平、民主权利与自由而奋斗的美国劳动人民日益坚决的反抗。
