    Northeast Deeply Inspects Basic Construction Preparation Work

    [This newspaper dispatch] To urge all units to quickly complete the basic construction preparation work for 1953, the former Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee conducted an in-depth inspection of the basic construction preparation work in late December last year and the first half of January this year, particularly inspecting in detail the preparation work of key departments and key projects.

    This inspection was personally presided over by Gu Zhuoxin, director of the Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee. The inspection methods included convening report meetings, sending people to inspect, and conducting statistical surveys. The inspection results showed that the basic construction preparation work in Northeast this year has made great progress compared to last year. As of early January, the entire region had 120,000 fixed construction workers, and winter training had generally begun. The reserves of various major building materials—cement, red bricks, wood, etc.—are sufficient to supply the needs of the first phase of construction and are being transported to the site one after another; other construction equipment and domestic and foreign equipment have also begun to be ordered. In terms of engineering design, some units have completed it, and those that have not yet completed it are actively working on it. Overall, it can basically be guaranteed that construction will start universally in April.

    The inspection also revealed many problems. The most important is that some units still do not pay enough attention to the preparation work, and the idea of passively waiting is quite serious. Engineering design has not been done well, and the technical strength of construction is very weak, which directly affects the start of construction. However, the leading cadres of these units do not actively try to solve these problems, but hold the erroneous attitude of "design relying on local governments to solve, and technical strength waiting for higher-level allocation." Some units still did not know what their engineering projects were for this year when inspected; or have not yet formulated a phased construction plan, so that the preparation work lost its correct basis. In terms of design, many units have not carefully collected, analyzed, and studied geological, hydrological surveys, and other original data, and have not paid enough attention to solving the problems that occurred. In addition, some units have not yet completed the ordering of equipment and materials, or have not yet stored enough building materials; some technical strength is still weak, especially the lack of technical workers for special types of work, such as electricians, welders, riveters, scaffolders, fitters, etc.

    In this inspection work, the Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee criticized various incorrect ideas and adopted the method of helping to solve problems as soon as they were discovered. After inspection of the 122 construction unit, it clarified the spirit of self-reliance that must be attached to basic construction work, began to change the idea of passively waiting, and began to improve the organizational structure, drawing 19 section-level cadres, more than 30 section chiefs, 5 workshop directors, and 22 engineering and technical personnel from the production departments. Of the three factory directors, two began to specialize in basic construction, and the number of fixed workers has increased to more than 3,000, and it is planned to organize construction personnel to study at the Electric Power Bureau, greatly strengthening the basic construction forces. At the same time, specific construction plans have been formulated, so the current preparation work is progressing rapidly. For a huge project of the Water Conservancy Bureau, the preliminary design did not complete soil analysis, geological surveys, and hydraulic experiments as required, and technical design of partial projects was carried out; the foundation of the temporary engineering house was shallow, and the eaves were short. One building was blown down by the wind just after the project was completed, and the engineering site was chaotic. After inspection, the bureau has begun to correct these shortcomings. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Materials Department proposed that a large number of red bricks would be lacking in the first phase of construction this year, and the Transportation Department proposed that transportation vehicles were insufficient. The committee immediately allocated 30 million red bricks from Shenyang and Fushun and designated the Highway Bureau to allocate cars to Anshan. While solving the problems in a timely manner, the committee has issued instructions on "Deeply Carrying Out Basic Construction Preparation Work" based on the problems discovered in this inspection, to further promote the basic construction preparation work in the entire region and ensure that engineering plans, engineering designs, construction forces, and equipment and materials can meet the requirements for starting work on schedule in terms of quantity, quality, and time.

### 东北深入检查基本建设准备工作

    东北深入检查基本建设准备工作
    【本报讯】为督促各单位迅速做好一九五三年的基本建设准备工作，原东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会于去年十二月下旬和今年一月上半月，深入地检查了基本建设准备工作，特别是详尽地检查了重点部门和重点工程的准备工作。
    这次检查是由东北人民经济计划委员会顾卓新主任亲自主持的。检查的办法有召集汇报、派人检查、调查统计三种。检查结果说明：今年东北的基本建设准备工作比去年大有进步。到一月上旬为止，全区已固定建筑工人十二万名，冬季训练普遍开始。各种主要建筑材料——水泥、红砖、木材等的储备量，已足够供应第一期施工的需要，并正陆续运往现场；其他建设器材以及国内国外设备，也已开始订货。在工程设计方面，部分单位已经结束，尚未结束的则在积极进行中。总的看来，基本上可以保证四月份内普遍开工。
    检查当中也发现不少问题。最主要的是部分单位对准备工作还不够重视，消极等待思想相当严重，工程设计未做好，施工技术力量很薄弱，直接影响开工。但这些单位的领导干部不是积极设法解决这些问题，而是抱着“设计靠地方政府解决，技术力量等上级调配”的错误态度。有些单位到检查时还不知道本单位今年的工程项目是什么；或尚未订出分期施工计划，致使准备工作失掉正确依据。在设计方面，不少单位对地质、水文勘察及其他原始资料的搜集、分析、研究还不仔细，对其中发生的问题也未十分注意解决。此外，还有些单位设备、器材的订货还没搞好，或者建筑材料尚未储备齐全；有的技术力量还薄弱，特别是缺乏特殊工种的技术工人，如电工、焊工、铆工、架工、钳工等。
    东北人民经济计划委员会在这次检查工作中，批判了各种不正确的思想，并采取了发现问题就随时协助解决的办法。一二二建设单位经过检查后，明确了必须重视基本建设工作贯彻自力更生的精神，开始转变了消极等待的思想，着手健全组织机构，从生产部门抽调了科级干部十九人，股长三十多人，车间主任五人，工程技术人员二十二人，三个厂长中有两个开始专管基本建设，固定工人已增到三千多人，并计划组织施工人员到电工局去学习，大大加强了基本建设力量，同时并开始制订了具体的施工计划，因而目前准备工作进展很快。水利局某一巨大工程，初步设计未按规定作完土壤分析、地质测量、水工试验，就进行部分工程的技术设计；临时工程房屋基础浅，房檐短，工程才完就被风吹倒了一栋；工程现场紊乱。经检查后，该局已开始纠正这些缺点。鞍山钢铁公司材料处提出今年第一期施工将缺大量红砖，运输部提出运输工具不足，该会马上从沈阳、抚顺拨去红砖三千万块，指定由公路局拨给鞍山汽车。在及时解决问题的同时，该会已根据这次检查中发现的问题，发出“深入进行基本建设准备工作”的指示，进一步推动全区的基本建设准备工作，保证工程计划、工程设计、施工力量以及设备、材料，从数量、质量及时间上，都能满足如期开工的要求。
