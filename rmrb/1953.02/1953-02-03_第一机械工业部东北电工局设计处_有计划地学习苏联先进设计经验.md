The Design Department of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building has systematically studied advanced Soviet design experience for the past two years, achieving significant results and gaining some experience.

Originally, most of the senior technicians in the design department had interned at the American "Westinghouse" company. They blindly worshipped "Westinghouse as the best in the world," adopting all of "Westinghouse's" data in their designs. All documents used "Westinghouse abbreviations," and equipment names followed "Westinghouse customs," using American manufacturer numbers instead of proper designations. One technician designed a heating system, claiming it was "the latest American style," and after completing the design, he demanded a promotion to engineer. Influenced by pro-American thought, newly employed young comrades also mistakenly believed that "without English, one cannot learn technology." Under these circumstances, advanced Soviet experience was difficult to promote. Some engineers considered themselves superior and disregarded the opinions of Soviet experts. In response to this situation, the leadership of the design department took a series of measures to educate the technical staff. Currently, a surge of learning from advanced Soviet experience has been initiated in the department.

First, the technical staff of the design department criticized pro-American thought during the "Three-Anti" campaign. During this period, they examined the negative consequences of past mistakes caused by pro-Americanism and individualism. At the same time, they pointed out the superiority of advanced Soviet experience through specific examples. For example, the annual output of a switch factory increased fivefold due to the adoption of Soviet product drawings. The design of the main workshops for motors and transformers greatly increased production by adopting advanced Soviet methods and quotas. Using American "standards," the output of motors was 30 kilowatts per square meter, and transformers were 60 kilovolt-amperes. By adopting Soviet technology and work-hour quotas, motor output could be increased to 60-80 kilowatts, and transformers could be increased to 250 kilovolt-amperes. Facts proved that adopting advanced Soviet experience saved the country a lot of money and accelerated construction, while blindly adopting American "standards" caused significant waste for the country. The technical staff of the department began to realize the error and shame of pro-Americanism and individualism, laying the foundation for learning advanced Soviet experience.

Second, they seriously studied Soviet design manuals. The designers in the department realized from their studies that Soviet design manuals were the essence of more than 30 years of advanced experience, expressing correct design ideas in every design. For example, factory specialization, inter-factory collaboration, standardization of product design, standardization of manufacturing processes, and mechanization of heavy work are all directions for modern factories. Studying these specific measures would better apply correct ideas to design work. Soviet design manuals fully implemented the principle of "obtaining the greatest results with the least investment" and made it concrete. Among the specific measures, there were many specific methods to learn from, such as how to fully utilize and improve existing buildings and equipment when renovating old factories, and how to use local materials as much as possible and replace expensive materials with inexpensive ones. For the convenience of learning and adoption, the department has begun drafting design manual formats and appropriately compiling Soviet designs into guidance materials.

Third, learn from Soviet experts. In addition to inviting Soviet experts to give reports, the department also compiled the records of the experts' talks and reports each time and distributed them to relevant personnel for study. Individuals who gained insights from talking with Soviet experts also returned to their groups to convey them to everyone, so that more people could know.

Fourth, learn Russian and master the tools for learning advanced Soviet experience. Starting in 1952, the leadership called on all technical staff to learn Russian within two years so that they could read books themselves. At the end of last year, the department began to transfer some people away from production to participate in accelerated Russian classes, graduating in 21 days. The third batch has now begun learning. At the same time, the department also opened two classes of amateur Russian classes, graduating in three months, with very good results.

Fifth, study general Soviet books, magazines, and materials. The department already has nearly a thousand Russian technical books and has signed a contract with the International Bookstore, so new books can be supplied to the department as soon as they arrive.

Sixth, promote advanced Soviet design methods. Based on advanced Soviet experience, the department clearly established a chief design engineer system last December, defining the responsibilities of engineers and chief engineers in each department. The department began to promote the parallel assembly line method, starting with the ventilation design group, which greatly improved work efficiency. Work that previously required 160 workdays now only takes 98 workdays to complete. The implementation of new working methods has strengthened the planning of design work and the collective cooperation ideas of designers. As a result of professional division of labor, the technical level of designers will also be greatly improved. Now, all groups in the department have been caught up in the upsurge of promoting parallel assembly line methods.

Seventh, timely rewards. Since the ideological criticism during the "Three-Anti" campaign last year, the department has begun to establish a trend of learning advanced Soviet experience. Many comrades have applied advanced Soviet experience to specific work, such as applying high-speed cutting methods to factory design, breaking conservative ideas; applying new power utilization rate coefficients to substations, saving funds; and the ventilation design group promoting parallel assembly line methods to improve work efficiency. The department has given these comrades timely rewards, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of comrades to learn advanced Soviet experience.

    第一机械工业部东北电工局设计处
    有计划地学习苏联先进设计经验
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部东北电工局设计处，两年来有计划地学习苏联先进设计经验，有显著成绩，并取得一些经验。
    原来设计处的高级技术人员中，大部分人在美国“西屋”公司作过实习，他们盲目崇拜“西屋天下第一”，在设计中采用全部“西屋”公司的资料，所有的文件都采用了“西屋缩写”，设备名称也沿用“西屋习惯”，用美国厂家号码来代替。有一个技术员设计了一种暖风系统，说那是“美国最新式”的，他在设计好了以后，就向领导上提出升任工程师的要求。由于崇美思想的影响，新参加工作的青年同志也错误地认为“不会英文，无法学技术”。在这种情况下，苏联先进经验是很难推广的。有些工程师认为自己了不起，轻视苏联专家的意见。针对这种情况，设计处领导方面采取了一系列的措施，对技术人员进行教育。目前该处已掀起学习苏联先进经验的热潮。
    首先设计处技术人员在“三反”运动中，对崇美思想进行了批判。在这期间检查了过去由于崇美、个人主义等错误思想所造成的恶果；同时通过具体事例指出了苏联先进经验的优越性。例如由于采用苏联的产品图纸，使某一个开关厂年产量提高了五倍。电机和变压器主要车间的设计，由于采用苏联先进方法和定额，产量大大提高。用美国“标准”，电机的产量是每平方公尺三十瓩，变压器六十千伏安；采用苏联技术和工时定额，电机可提高六十至八十瓩，变压器可以提高到二百五十千伏安。事实证明，采用苏联先进经验就给国家节省了大量资金，加快了建设速度；而盲目地采用美国“标准”，就给国家造成很大的浪费。该处技术人员由此开始认识到崇美思想和个人主义的错误与可耻，为学习苏联先进经验打下了基础。
    其次是认真学习苏联设计书。该处设计人员从学习中体会到：苏联设计书是三十多年先进经验的精华，在每一个设计里都表现了正确的设计思想。例如工厂专业化，厂间的协作，产品设计的统一化，制造过程的典型化，沉重工作的机械化等，都是现代工厂的方向。研究这些具体措施，就会更好地把正确的思想运用到设计工作中去。苏联设计书中充分贯彻了“利用最少的投资，得到最大的成果”的原则，并且把它具体化了。在具体措施当中，有许多可供学习的具体办法，如改造旧厂时如何充分利用和改进现有的建筑和设备，如何尽量采用当地材料和用廉价材料代替价格昂贵的材料等。为了学习和采用上的方便，该处已着手起草编制设计书格式，并把苏联设计作适当的编纂，编成指导资料。
    第三，向苏联专家学习。该处向苏联专家学习的办法，除了请苏联专家作报告外，每次还把专家的谈话和报告的记录整理出来，发给有关人员研究学习。个别人和苏联专家谈话有了心得，也回到组里向大家传达，使更多的人知道。
    第四，学习俄文，掌握学习苏联先进经验的工具。从一九五二年开始，领导方面就号召所有技术人员在两年内学会俄文，做到自己可以看书。去年年底，该处开始调出一部分人脱离生产，参加速成俄文班，二十一天毕业。现在第三批已开始学习。同时该处还开办了两班业余俄文班，三个月毕业，成绩也很好。
    第五，学习一般的苏联书籍、杂志、资料。该处已有近千本的俄文技术书，并和国际书店订了合同，新书到来就可供给该处。
    第六，推行苏联的先进设计方法。该处在去年十二月根据苏联先进经验，明确地建立了主任设计工程师制，订出各科工程师和主任工程师的职责。该处从通风设计组开始推行平行流水作业法，工作效率大大提高，过去需要一百六十工日的工作，现在只要九十八个工日就完成了。实行新的工作法加强了设计工作的计划性和设计人员的集体合作思想。因为专业分工的结果，设计人员的技术水平也将大大提高。现在全处各组已卷入推行平行流水作业法的热潮。
    第七，及时奖励。从去年“三反”时进行思想批判以后，该处已开始树立了学习苏联先进经验的风气。不少同志把苏联先进经验运用到具体工作中去，如把高速切削法运用到工厂设计中去，打破了保守思想；把新的电力使用率系数使用到变电所去，节省了资金；通风设计组推行平行流水作业法提高了工作效率等。该处都及时给这些同志以奖励，因而大大鼓舞了同志们学习苏联先进经验的热情。
