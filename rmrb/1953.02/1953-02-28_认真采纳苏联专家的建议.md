Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Soviet experts possess the world's most advanced science and technology and have rich experience. In the past few years, with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, our country's many factories and mines have achieved great success in their restoration and reconstruction work. Facts have proven that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and conscientiously adopting the suggestions of Soviet experts are of great significance to the success of our economic construction work. Facts have proven that any leading cadres who do not value the suggestions of Soviet experts, fail to adopt and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts in a timely and conscientious manner, or implement them in a dragging, perfunctory manner, or easily shelve them when encountering difficulties in execution, have incurred serious losses in their work. Today's news in this newspaper about Wang Yaoliang, the former captain of the 18th Engineering Team of the Northwest Construction Engineering Company, and others failing to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, is an example.

    From the mistakes of Wang Yaoliang and others, we should learn a lesson and further conscientiously adopt and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. All units in various regions where Soviet experts are assisting in work should universally educate employees and cadres, so that responsible cadres fully recognize the importance of implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. It should be particularly pointed out that whether the adoption of Soviet experts' suggestions is conscious and resolute is one of the important signs of the leadership level and political awareness of leading cadres, and a touchstone for whether a Communist Party member and revolutionary worker is infinitely loyal to the cause of national construction. At the same time, technical personnel should be educated to truly value the suggestions of Soviet experts, learn the technology of Soviet experts, and learn the Soviet experts' attitude, viewpoints, methods, and their ideological style towards work. And the suggestions of Soviet experts should be conveyed to the masses of workers, so that the suggestions of Soviet experts can directly meet the masses and be understood by the working masses. By doing so, not only can the opinions of Soviet experts be easily implemented, but also the workers can be mobilized to supervise leading cadres and technical personnel to adopt a serious and responsible attitude towards the suggestions of Soviet experts.

    认真采纳苏联专家的建议
    苏联专家掌握了世界上最先进的科学技术并有丰富的经验。几年来，我国许多工厂、矿山的恢复和改建工作，在苏联专家的无私帮助下，取得了很大的成绩。事实证明：学习苏联的先进经验，认真采纳苏联专家的建议，对于我们经济建设工作的成功是具有极大意义的。事实证明：凡是领导干部不重视苏联专家的建议，对苏联专家的建议没有及时认真地采纳实行；或者实行起来拖拖拉拉、马马虎虎；或者在执行中遇到困难便轻易搁置起来的，都招致了工作上的严重损失。今天本报发表的西北建筑工程公司第十八工程队原队长王尧梁等不执行苏联专家建议的消息，就是一个实例。
    从王尧梁等的错误中，我们应该得到教训，进一步认真地采纳实行苏联专家的建议。各地有苏联专家帮助工作的单位，都应该普遍向职工和干部进行教育，要使负责干部充分认识到贯彻苏联专家建议的重要性。特别应该指出：采纳苏联专家建议是否自觉和坚决，是领导干部领导水平、政治觉悟高低的重要标志之一，是一个共产党员和革命工作者是否无限忠诚地对待祖国建设事业的试金石。同时，要教育技术人员真正重视苏联专家的建议，学习苏联专家的技术，学习苏联专家对待工作的立场、观点、方法和他们的思想作风。并且要把苏联专家的建议向职工群众传达，使苏联专家的建议直接与群众见面，为工人群众所了解。这样做，不但可以使苏联专家的意见容易贯彻，而且还可以发动职工督促领导干部、技术人员对苏联专家的建议采取认真负责的态度。
