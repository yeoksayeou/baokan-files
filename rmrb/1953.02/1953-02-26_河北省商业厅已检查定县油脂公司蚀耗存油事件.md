    Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce Investigates Embezzlement of Stored Oil Incident at Ding County Oil Company
    Letter from Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce: After the "Reader's Letters" column published on February 1st the letter from Comrades Lin San and Shu Feng suggesting that our department seriously handle the embezzlement of stored oil by the Ding County Oil Branch Company, on February 4th, our department, together with the Ding County Prefectural Commissioner's Office Industry and Commerce Section and the Hebei Provincial Oil Company Supervision Section, sent people to the Ding County Oil Branch Company to conduct an in-depth investigation. The investigation proved that the company suffered an accidental loss of more than 4,000 catties of stored oil. Besides the oil leaking from cracked oil pools and the corrosion caused by the chemical reaction between the pool wall paper and the oil, whether there are other reasons cannot be confirmed at this time. The reasons for this situation are that the company's former manager Han Chengbi, current manager Wu Yinsheng, deputy manager Ren Jiexia (former head of the company's secretariat), and storage and transportation section chief Yang Chunxi are not responsible for their work. We have suggested that the Hebei Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee give them due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances.

    河北省商业厅已检查定县油脂公司蚀耗存油事件
    河北省人民政府商业厅来信：二月一日“读者来信”栏发表了林三、曙风两同志建议我厅严肃处理定县油脂分公司蚀耗存油的来信后，二月四日，我厅和定县专署工商科、河北省油脂公司监察科一起派人到定县油脂分公司深入检查。结果证明该分公司存油意外的损失四千余斤，除了油池裂损漏掉的和池壁纸与油起了化学作用蚀耗掉的以外，是否还有其他原因，现时无法肯定。发生这种情况的原因，是该公司前任经理韩城璧、现任经理武寅生、副经理任介侠（前任公司秘书科长）、储运科长杨春喜等对工作不负责任。我们已建议河北省人民政府监察委员会根据情节轻重给以应得处分。
