Scientific Management System of the No. 1 Warehouse Directly Under the Northeast Trade Bureau
Special Correspondent of this newspaper: Chen Xin

Before June of last year, the management work of the No. 1 Warehouse directly under the Northeast Trade Bureau (formerly the Northeast Ministry of Trade) was extremely chaotic. Goods were piled up everywhere, and pedestrian passages were blocked; in April and May of last year, an average of 42 cases of changing and returning delivery orders occurred every day. Due to the inability to deliver goods that were in stock and the random allocation of goods that were not, 8,570 trucks returned empty, wasting 60 million yuan in truck transportation fees alone; cotton and matches were piled together, and caustic soda and hydrosulfite were placed in the same warehouse (these two items are prone to fire upon contact); a large amount of stock cream deteriorated; warehouse assets occupied a huge amount of capital, and the average storage time of goods in the warehouse was more than 100 days. After the rectification of the warehouse movement was launched in June of last year, the warehouse implemented enterprise management, with goods being stored in separate zones and categories under the responsibility of specific personnel, ensuring that goods could be moved in and out quickly. The accident of empty trucks returning has disappeared, and the problem of changing and returning delivery orders was greatly reduced in July of last year; the quantity of goods stored per square meter has increased, and the use of assets has begun to be standardized; warehouse operating procedures have been established, and a system of internal and external liaison responsibilities has been established, which has greatly improved work efficiency. Since July of last year, the average storage time of goods in the warehouse has been shortened to 39 days, and the average storage time of various types of fabrics, which originally had a storage limit of 30 days, has been shortened to about 10 days. The scientific management system established by the warehouse is introduced below:

I. Establishing a System of Responsibility for Zoning, Categorizing, and Assigning Specific Personnel to Specific Goods
    First, they measured the warehouse area accurately and carefully, numbered the original five red brick warehouses and seven freight yards, and stored all goods in warehouses or freight yards according to their variety, specifications, nature, and use. At the same time, they divided the approximately 7,000 complex general merchandise items into 18 categories, with one or two categories stored in one warehouse or freight yard, and a maximum of three categories. Each warehouse and freight yard was further divided into three sections, and each section was further divided into several areas according to the variety and specifications of the goods and the circumstances of valuable, delicate, perishable, and dangerous goods, which were stored separately. Each warehouse, freight yard, and each category and variety of goods were assigned to a specific person to be fully responsible from the entry and storage to the delivery of goods. In this way, the sense of responsibility of the warehouse keepers was strengthened, the enthusiasm for learning commodity knowledge and storage technology was increased, the previous passive "watching the piles" mentality was overcome, and accidents such as commodity deterioration, unjustified losses, and affecting the entry and exit of goods were basically eliminated.

In order to consolidate this specialized area and responsibility system and give play to the spirit of mutual assistance among all warehouse employees, the manager's office set up a "Commodity Zoning Storage Map," and the warehouse manager and warehouse keepers each set up a "Product Storage Plan Map" for their own area and warehouse; each stack of goods was hung with a card stating the location of the goods, name, specifications, unit, quantity, date of entry, and date of exit (recently, an item for the storage period of the goods in the warehouse has been added to the card in order to fill in the commodity requisition form and urge the inventory unit to allocate the goods). In addition, they also assigned accountants to the warehouse and freight yard to handle commodity accounting procedures, abolished the commodity storage accounts of the business section and the warehouse keepers (the warehouse keepers used cards instead of accounts), simplified the levels, and combined the accounting section, the business section, and the warehouse keepers. This laid the foundation for the scientific management system of the warehouse. With these three methods, it is clear at a glance where the goods are stored by looking at the map. The implementation of these three methods has also eliminated the phenomenon of discrepancies between goods and accounts and facilitated mutual assistance among all employees. For example, on August 26th of last year, the Shenyang Wholesale Station allocated two train cars of Shilin fine cloth to the Siping Wholesale Station. Chen Baocheng, a resident staff member, went to the No. 9 warehouse where the cloth was stored according to the "Commodity Zoning Plan Map" in the receiving and dispatching guide, completed the delivery procedures with the accountant, and requested immediate delivery and loading for shipment. However, the warehouse keeper was at a meeting, and other warehouse keepers were busy delivering goods to retail units and could not deliver the goods immediately. In the past, in this case, they had to let the penalty fee be charged for the train car and transport it another day. However, Chen Baocheng saw the "Goods Storage Plan Map" hanging on the wall, found the stack of goods according to the map, and verified it with the card attached to the stack of goods, and then asked the porters to load the Shilin fine cloth into the train car accurately and without error within two hours under the supervision and assistance of the accountant.

II. Preliminary Implementation of Quota Management System in Warehouse Operation
    On the principle of paying attention to commodity safety, convenient storage and retrieval, and not affecting quality, they mobilized all employees to use their brains to find ways to expand the storage volume per unit area, so as to give play to the efficiency of warehouse equipment and strive to increase warehouse income and net profit. They started by reasonably stacking 32 main commodities and reducing gaps, and further studied ways to increase the capacity of various commodities per unit area of each car. They broke the "one-person-one-hand-high" standard for stacks of goods, and the area of one square meter increased from only half a ton of cotton yarn in the past to 1.462 tons; after changing the interval distance of "two boxes in a row and taking from both sides" to "four boxes in a row and taking from both sides," each warehouse and freight yard increased from only 45 cars of goods in the past to more than 90 cars of goods; and the six stacks (six train cars) of sacks that were not afraid of being crushed, which were scattered, were changed into one stack, freeing up six-fourths of the storage area. The entire warehouse used to store only 450 cars of goods and still complained that "there was not enough space," but now it has increased to storing 1,009 cars of goods, and it is preparing to further improve the total storage volume by means of reasonable stacking and reducing gaps. The storage volume of individual warehouse keepers has increased by one to three times, and the work efficiency of the entire warehouse has been greatly improved. In the past, the entire warehouse had 78 warehouse keepers to store 450 cars of goods, and they were still calling "not enough manpower," but now the entire warehouse stores more than 1,000 cars of goods, and 57 warehouse keepers are enough. With the simplification of procedures and the improvement of the system, the ratio of administrative staff and warehouse keepers has also been initially set at one to one, and the ratio of loaders (including temporary workers) and warehouse keepers has been set at four to one.

While increasing the storage volume per unit area, they also paid great attention to the rational use and saving of assets. For example, using cement blocks instead of sleepers to pad the bottom of the stacks of goods, cement blocks can "manage four with one" (one cement block can place four boxes from four corners, while originally two sleepers were needed to pad one box), and each car of goods can save 5.185 million yuan in sleeper padding costs (in the past, it cost 5.76 million yuan to pad each car of goods with sleepers, but now it only costs 575,000 yuan to pad with cement blocks).

They have also made some achievements in reducing commodity losses, ensuring commodity quality, and reasonably reducing expenses. In the past, due to poor technical storage and damage to commodity packaging during transportation, commodity losses were large, and the quality of some commodities deteriorated. Now, the business section of the warehouse has added several technical instructors to specialize in studying and guiding technical storage work; a packaging group has been established to inspect and repackage damaged commodities before they are put into storage, and the "one-time inventory system" is implemented to be fully responsible; at the same time, all employees are mobilized to study and learn commodity knowledge and find ways to do a good job in technical storage. The employees have researched the "tent opening and closing method" for wool moth prevention, the "rain-proof stacking method," and many methods for preventing rats and moisture to reduce losses and ensure quality. In addition, there are also reasonable quotas for operating expenses.

III. Establishing a System of Liaison Responsibility for Each Link Inside and Outside the Warehouse
    Externally, the warehouse emphasizes the implementation of a commodity storage contract system with the inventory unit. At present, the inventory unit cannot put forward specific plans for commodity storage, so the warehouse takes the initiative to understand the inventory unit's procurement plans and allocation plans, and based on this, it speculates on the volume of goods that the warehouse may store and allocate in each quarter and month, striving to make the work proactive. At the same time, it firmly requires the cargo owner to implement the "advance notice of commodity entry and exit" and the "goods ticket and price go together" system. In addition, it also established a "Allocation Accident Registration Form" and a "Commodity Requisition Form." The "Allocation Accident Registration Form" is specifically used to record various accidents that occur when the allocation clerk blindly opens the ticket regardless of the inventory, makes mistakes in the commodity number, name, specifications, and cargo owner's entry process, so as to urge the improvement of allocation work. The "Commodity Requisition Form" is a form made by the warehouse keeper according to the storage period stipulated in the storage contract, listing commodities that are about to expire or have expired and become backlogged, urging the cargo owner to quickly allocate them. In this way, the procedures can be completed and the goods can be stacked within 24 hours of entry, greatly reducing accidents in the commodity exit work.

Internally, the warehouse has established a liaison responsibility system. Managers, warehouse managers, warehouse keepers, accountants, financial personnel, etc. all have operating procedures, and everyone has formed an organic whole, making warehouse management scientific. Taking the warehouse keeper as an example: he has established regulations with the resident staff member of the inventory unit on the goods ticket going together and the timely entry of goods; he has established regulations with the delivery clerk of the inventory unit on accurate delivery and rapid loading; he has established regulations with the accountant on keeping accounts at any time and helping each other; he has established regulations with the porters on notifying them in advance of the delivery of goods, handling them gently to ensure safety, and avoiding accidents; and he has also stipulated quotas for the delivery time according to the different volume, weight, quality, and quantity of different commodities, etc., thereby greatly improving the delivery efficiency. For example, it used to take four or five hours to deliver a car of goods, but now it only takes twenty or thirty minutes. In addition to the consistency of goods and accounts and the simplification of procedures, the phenomena of wasting manpower, freight, and time, especially the penalty fee charged by the porters, has been greatly reduced.

The warehouse's ability to establish such a scientific management system is inseparable from the strengthening of political work. On the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, by vigorously carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, the class consciousness of all employees has been improved, the employees' understanding of the functions of warehouse work has been corrected, and the concept of cherishing state property has been established, which has enabled the warehouse to smoothly establish and implement this set of scientific management systems. Now, it is also necessary to further give play to the guaranteeing role of the party branch, strengthen political leadership, and do a good job in the following three tasks to solve the existing problems in business operations: First, strengthen the planning and initiative of the work. Only in this way can the inventory plan be realized and the "contract system" of storage and contact be seriously implemented. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish and improve scientific statistics and analysis work to guide warehouse business activities and strengthen initiative. Second, improve organizational work. After the warehouse implemented the method of accountants going down to the warehouse and freight yard, the general warehouse did not establish a general commodity storage account, and the manager only relied on statistical work to understand the situation, but did not know the specific names and values of each type of commodity, thereby undermining the principle of the warehouse chief system - the manager's responsibility system. At the same time, there is still a phenomenon of discrepancies between goods and accounts in the No. 13 warehouse. The liaison responsibility system and operating procedures and management systems are not yet consolidated in some places. These need to be quickly improved. Third, improve the financial plan for supervising expenses and conscientiously implement the economic accounting system. At present, the storage costs of the warehouse are still too high, and at the same time, some money that could or could not be spent has been spent, and the potential power of the warehouse has not been fully utilized, especially the family background and expenses have not really been "clear in mind," which has affected the serious implementation of quota management. After these shortcomings are improved, the warehouse will be able to play a better role in ensuring the accelerated circulation of commodities.

    东北贸易局直属第一仓库的科学管理制度
    本报特约记者　陈新
    去年六月份以前，东北贸易局（原东北贸易部）直属第一仓库管理工作异常混乱。物资到处堆放，行人通道都被堵塞起来；去年四、五两月份，改提货票、顶回提货票的事每天平均有四十二起，因有货付不出和无货乱调拨以致空车返回的大车有八千五百七十辆，仅大车搬运费就浪费了六千万元；棉花和火柴混着堆在一起，曹达灰和保险粉放在一个库房里（这两种物品一接触即容易起火）；库存奶油大量变质；仓库资财占用了庞大的资金，商品在库保管时间平均在一百天以上。去年六月开展整顿仓库运动以后，该仓库实行了企业化管理，商品分区、分类专责保管，作到了工作有条有理，保证了商品进得快出得快。运货大车空返事故已经绝迹，改提货票、顶回提货票的事去年七月份即大大减少；每一平方公尺面积上存放商品的数量增大了，资财使用开始有了定额；有了仓库操作规程，建立了内、外联系责任制度，工作效率因而大大提高。去年七月以来，商品在库保管时间平均已缩短到三十九天，其中原来在库保管限期为三十天的各种布匹，平均已缩短到十天左右。现在把该仓库建立的一套科学管理制度介绍如下：
    一、建立商品分区、分类和专人专物保管的责
        任制度
    首先，他们把仓库面积进行了精确仔细的丈量，将原有的五个红砖库房和七个货场分别编了号码，把所有商品根据品种、规格、性质、用途，分别保管在库房里或货场上。同时他们把七千种左右复杂的百货划分为十八类，一个库房、一个货场里专门保管一类或两类，最多保管三类。每个库房、货场又分三格，每格再按商品品种规格和贵重、精致、易腐、危险品等情况划分若干区域，分别保管起来。每个库房、货场和每类商品及品种，都指定专人从进货、保管到付出负责到底。这样，保管员的责任心加强了，学习商品知识和保管技术的热情提高了，过去那种消极的“看堆”思想克服了，商品变质、无故损耗、影响商品出入库的事故也基本上消灭了。
    为了把这种专区专责制度巩固起来，并发挥仓库全体职工的互助精神，经理室设一份“商品分区保管图”，库长和保管员各设一份本区、本库的“产物存放平面图”；每个货垛上挂着一张载明商品货地、名称、规格、单位、数量、何时入库数目、何时出库数目的卡片（最近又在卡片上增加一项商品在库保管期限科目，以备填写商品催拨表，督促存货单位调拨）。另外，他们又把会计配备到库房、货场办理商品会计手续，取消了业务科和保管员的商品保管帐（保管员以卡片代帐），简化了层次，使会计科、业务科和保管员三者结合起来。这就为仓库的科学管理制度奠定了基础。实行了这三种办法，什么商品存放在什么地方，看图后便一目了然。实行了这三种办法，还消灭了货帐不符的现象，并便于全体职工彼此互助。例如，去年八月二十六日沈阳批发站调拨给四平批发站两火车厢士林细布，驻在员陈宝成按收发指引的“商品分区平面图”到保管布匹的九号库找会计办好了出库手续，要求立即付货、装车发走。但保管员开会去了，别的保管员都忙着把商品付给零售单位，不能立即付货。过去在这种情况下，只好任凭被罚车皮留置费，改日再运。但陈宝成看到墙上悬挂的“货物存放平面图”，按图找到货垛又与货垛上拴的卡片对证后，便请搬运工人在会计的监督和帮助下，在两小时内及时准确无误地把这些士林细布装车发走了。
    二、初步实行了仓库经营中的定额管理制度
    他们在注意商品安全、存取方便、不影响质量的原则下，动员全体职工开动脑筋，设法扩大单位面积保管量，以发挥仓库设备效能，争取增加仓库的收入和纯利。开始先从三十二种主要商品进行合理码垛、减少空隙作起，进一步研究各种商品在每一车单位面积上增加容量的办法。他们打破了“一人一手高”的货垛标准，一平方公尺面积由过去只放半吨棉纱提高到放一点四六二吨；把“二箱一排两边取”的间隔距离改为“四箱一排两边取”后，每个库房、货场由过去只放四十五车货增加到放九十车货以上；将零散堆放的六垛（六火车厢）不怕压的麻袋改垛一堆，腾出了六分之四的保管面积。整个仓库过去只保管四百五十车货，还嚷“地方不够用”，现在已增加到保管一千零九车货，还准备进一步用合理码垛、减少空隙的方法再提高总保管量。保管员个人的保管量提高了一倍至三倍不等，全仓库工作效率大为提高。过去全仓库七十八个保管员保管四百五十车货，还在叫“人手不够”，现在全仓库保管一千多车货，用五十七个保管员就够了。随着手续的简化，制度的改进，也初步规定了行政工作人员和保管员的人数为一与一之比，装卸工人（包括临时工）和保管员的人数为四与一之比。
    在提高单位面积保管量的同时，他们对合理使用和节省资财也十分重视。如以洋灰块代替枕木垫垛底，洋灰块可以“一块管四”（一块洋灰块可以从四角放四只箱子，原来是两根枕木垫一只箱子），每车货即可以节省垫底枕木费五百一十八万五千元
    （过去每车货用枕木垫底需五百七十六万元，现用洋灰块垫底只需五十七万五千元）。
    他们在减少商品损耗、保证商品质量和合理降低经费开支方面也作出了一些成绩。过去，由于技术保管不良和商品包装在运输途中受到损坏，商品损耗很大，有的商品质量变劣。现在该仓库业务科增设了几个技术指导员，专门研究并指导技术保管工作；成立了包装组，检查和重新包装入库前包装损坏的商品，实行“一次清点制”负责到底；同时动员全体职工研究和学习商品知识，想办法找窍门作好技术保管。职工们已研究出呢绒防虫“帐棚开闭法”，“防雨封垛法”以及防鼠、防潮，以减少损耗和保证质量的许多办法。另外，在经营开支方面也有了合理定额。
    三、建立仓库内外各环节的联系责任制度
    对外方面，该仓库强调和存货单位实行商品保管合同制。目前存货单位还不能提出商品保管的具体计划，该仓库就主动去了解存货单位的采购计划和分拨计划，据以推测该仓库各季度、月份可能保管商品的进货量和外拨量，争取工作能够主动。同时，坚决要求货主实行“商品出入库预告”、 “货票、货价同行”制度。另外还建立了“调拨事故登记表”和“商品催拨表”。“调拨事故登记表”专记调拨员不管库存盲目开票，弄错商品号码、品名、规格及货主进货过程中发生的各种事故，藉以督促改进调拨工作。“商品催拨表”是保管员根据保管合同所规定的保管期限，将快到期或过期形成积压的商品制表，督促货主迅速外拨。这样使进货不超过二十四小时就可办好手续，摆好货垛，大大减少了商品出库工作中的事故。
    对内方面，该仓库建立了联系责任制度。经理、库长、保管员、会计、财务等人员都有了操作规程，大家结成了有机整体，使仓库管理工作科学化。以保管员为例：他与存货单位的驻在员建立货票同行和商品及时入库的规约；与存货单位的提货员建立付货准确和装车迅速的规约；与会计建立随时对帐和相互帮助的规约；与搬运工人建立付货事先通知、轻拿轻放保证安全和不出事故的规约，根据不同商品体积、重质、数量又规定了付出时间的定额等等，因而大大提高了付货效率。如付出一汽车商品，过去一般需要四、五小时，现在只需要二、三十分钟。再加上货帐相符和手续简化等因素，浪费人力、运费和时间的现象，特别是被搬运车夫罚留置费的事已大大减少。
    该仓库所以能够建立起这样的科学管理制度，是和加强了政治工作分不开的。他们在“三反”运动的基础上，通过大力开展增产节约运动，提高了全体职工的阶级觉悟，端正了职工对仓库工作职能的认识，树立了爱护国家财产的观念，这才使该仓库顺利地建立和实行了这一套科学管理制度。现在还应该进一步发挥党支部的保证作用，加强政治领导，作好下述三项工作，以解决目前业务经营上还存在的问题：一、加强工作计划性和主动性。这样才能实现存货计划，认真贯彻保管、联系等“合同制”。同时，还需要建立和健全科学统计和分析工作，以指导仓库业务活动，加强主动性。二、改进组织工作。该仓库实行会计下库房、下货场的办法以后，总仓库没有建立起总的商品保管帐，经理只凭统计工作了解情况，而不知道每类商品的具体品名和价值，因而破坏了仓库一长制——经理负责制的原则。同时十三号库房还有货账不符的现象。联系责任制和操作规程及管理制度中，有些地方还不巩固。这都需要迅速加以改进。三、健全监督开支的财务计划，认真贯彻经济核算制。目前该仓库保管费还显得过高，同时有些可花可不花的钱花了，仓库潜在力量还没有充分发挥，特别是家底情况和开支还没有真正作到“心中有数”，影响了定额管理的认真执行。这些缺点改进后，将会更好地发挥仓库在保证商品加速流转中的作用。
