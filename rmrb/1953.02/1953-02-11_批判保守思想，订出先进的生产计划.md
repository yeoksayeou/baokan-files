Economic Life Commentary

    While carrying out large-scale capital construction, we must also ensure that the production of existing factories and mines is carried out even better. This is because the funds for large-scale economic construction must be accumulated from production; the equipment, materials, power, etc. for capital construction must rely on the supply from existing factories and mines; and the constantly rising living requirements of the masses must also be met by existing factories and mines. To carry out this year's production even better, the first step is to formulate advanced production plans based on average advanced quotas. An advanced plan is an action program for an enterprise. It guides all employees to work hard towards a goal in their respective positions. It encourages backward workers to learn from advanced workers, thereby continuously improving production. However, a backward and conservative plan will not only greatly limit the potential of our enterprises, but will also cause the various quota indicators of our country's plans in the future to be established on an unreliable, backward, and conservative basis.
    The situations of some units under the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Liaoxi No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, etc. in compiling plans, as published in this newspaper today, show that conservative tendencies are still quite serious. They are unwilling to seriously explore the potential of enterprises, unwilling to take last year's average advanced quotas as this year's planned quotas, but try their best to find the most backward figures as the basis for formulating plans, so as to avoid being unable to complete them if the plans are set too high. The reason why these units are so conservative in compiling plans is mainly because of problems with the leadership's thinking.
    Some leading cadres of some units, although they know that the plan can be revised higher, deliberately do not set the plan correctly in order to "hold back" and increase production and savings in the future; or in order to overfulfill the plan in the future and get more factory director funds. This is departmentalism at play. In their view, it seems that the plan is only for the leading organs, and that the production situation of their own enterprise should be maintained at a backward level, with no need to continue to improve. For example, the Liaoxi No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, after the work team helped them solve many problems and production greatly improved, the leading cadres still dared not maintain this level when formulating the plan. They were afraid that no one would solve the problems in production after the work team left, as if they had no responsibility to remove various obstacles for production. The above-mentioned backward and conservative ideas must be criticized. Only in this way can advanced production plans be formulated conscientiously.

### 批判保守思想，订出先进的生产计划

    批判保守思想，订出先进的生产计划
    在进行大规模基本建设的同时，我们还必须使现有厂矿的生产进行得更好。因为大规模经济建设的资金要从生产中积累；基本建设的设备、器材、动力等要靠现有的厂矿供给；群众不断上升的生活要求也要靠现有的厂矿来满足。要把今年的生产进行得更好，第一步就需要根据平均先进定额制定先进的生产计划。先进的计划是一个企业的行动纲领，它指引着全体职工在各自的岗位上为着一个目标而奋发向前，它鼓舞着落后的工人向先进的工人看齐，从而不断地提高生产。而落后的保守的计划，不但将使我们企业潜在力量的发挥受到很大限制，而且将使今后我们国家计划的各种定额指标都建立在一个不足为凭的落后的保守的基础上面。
    今天本报发表的中央燃料工业部所属的有些单位和辽西第一机械厂等编制计划的情况，就表现了保守倾向还相当严重。他们不肯认真地发掘企业中的潜在力量，不肯把去年的平均先进定额做为今年的计划定额，而是尽量设法找出最落后的数目字做为订计划的根据，免得订高了不好完成。这些单位在编制计划中所以这样保守，主要还是因为领导思想有毛病。
    有些单位的领导干部，虽然自知计划可以再订高一些；但是为了“留一手”，准备将来开展增产节约时好多增加一点；或者为了将来超额完成计划，好多拿厂长基金，便故意不把计划订正确。这是本位主义在作怪。在他们看来，似乎计划只是给领导机关做的，似乎本企业的生产状况应该保持在落后的水平上，没有继续提高一步的必要。例如辽西第一机械厂，当工作组帮他们解决了许多问题，生产大大提高了以后，领导干部在订计划时仍不敢保持这个水平。他们怕工作组走了以后没人去解决生产中的问题，似乎他们自己没有责任去为生产扫除各种障碍。诸如上述的这些落后的保守思想，必须加以批判，只有如此，才能认真编制出先进的生产计划来。
