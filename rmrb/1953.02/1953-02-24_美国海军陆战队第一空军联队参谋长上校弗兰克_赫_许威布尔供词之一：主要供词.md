    One of the Confessions of Colonel Frank H. Schwable, Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing, US Marine Corps: Main Confession.

    I am Colonel Frank H. Schwable, 04429. Until I was shot down and captured on July 8, 1952, I was the Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing.

    I have served in the Marine Corps since 1929, was appointed an aviator in 1931, and have served in many parts of the world. Before I came to Korea, I was on duty in the Aviation Department of the Marine Corps Headquarters.

    Instructions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff

    I arrived in Korea on April 10, 1952, to assume my duties as Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing. All my instructions and decisions had to be approved by Deputy Commander General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. Before I fully assumed the responsibilities of Chief of Staff, General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. summoned me to his office to discuss various issues of the Wing. During the meeting, he said, "Has Binney told you all the background of VMF-513's special mission?" I asked him if he was referring to "Super Propaganda" (which was the code name we used for germ bombs), and he confirmed this. I told him that Binney had already told me everything.

    The officer who preceded me as Chief of Staff, Colonel Arthur A. Binney, as required by his duties, told me about the outline of the overall plan for germ warfare in Korea, and the details of the part that the 1st Marine Air Wing had been responsible for up to that time.

    The overall plan for germ warfare in Korea was instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951. In that month, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a special envoy to the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Command (then General Ridgway) an instruction ordering the commencement of germ warfare in Korea, initially in a small, experimental phase, but gradually expanding.

    This instruction was conveyed to General Weyland, Commander of the Far East Air Forces stationed in Tokyo. General Weyland then personally convened a meeting of General Everest, Commander of the Fifth Air Force in Korea, and the Commander of the 19th Bombardment Group stationed in Okinawa, operating under the direct command of the Far East Air Forces.

    The plan (which I am about to outline) was studied, and an agreement was reached on the major aspects of the issue; and the following intelligence was brought back to Korea personally and verbally by General Everest, because for the purpose of secrecy, it was decided that there should be no written material about this matter in Korea that could be captured.

        Objectives

    The basic objective at the time was to test the various factors of germ warfare under field conditions, and in the future, depending on the results obtained and the situation in Korea, to possibly expand the field trials into a part of regular combat operations.

    The effects of various available diseases were to be tested, especially their spread or contagiousness under different circumstances, and also to test whether each disease seriously disrupted the enemy's operations or the daily work of civilians, or only caused minor inconveniences, or could be completely controlled without causing difficulties. Under field conditions, different types of ordnance or containers were to be tested, and different types of aircraft were to be tested for their suitability as tools for carrying germ bombs.

    The terrain to be tested included plateaus, coastal areas, open areas, valley areas, isolated areas, interconnected areas, large and small towns, clustered cities, and fairly scattered cities. All possible areas or all possible combinations of areas were to be tested.

    It was not stated how long these tests would last, but it was to be long enough to include all the extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures in Korea.

    All possible dropping methods were to be tested, and tactics were to be developed, including initially only night attacks, and then expanding to daytime attacks by specialized squadrons. Various styles of bombing were to be tested, from bombing by a single aircraft to bombing by groups of aircraft, and germ bombs were to be used simultaneously with conventional bombs.

    Special attention was to be paid to testing and observing the enemy's reactions in every possible way, to find out what his countermeasures were, what propaganda steps he would take, and to what extent this war affected his military operations.

    Security measures were to be thoroughly tested—both against friendly forces and against the enemy. For friendly forces, all possible steps were to be taken to limit news about the use of this weapon and to control intelligence about this issue. For the enemy, all means were to be used to deceive the enemy and prevent him from actually proving that this weapon was being used.

    Finally, if circumstances so required, the experimental phase of germ warfare could be expanded into a part of military or tactical operations in Korea, as instructed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

    The Initial Phase

    B-29 aircraft taking off from Okinawa began using germ bombs in November 1951, adopting a method of what could be called indiscriminate bombing against all targets in North Korea. The target on one night might be in the northeast of Korea, and the next night might be in the northwest of Korea. Their actions of dropping germ bombs were combined with ordinary nighttime armed reconnaissance, as an economical and secure method.

    In early January 1952, General Hilt, then Commander of the 1st Marine Air Wing, was summoned to the Fifth Air Force Headquarters in Seoul. There, General Everest told him about the instructions issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and ordered him to send the 513th Night Fighter Squadron (VMF513) of the 33rd Air Group of the 1st Marine Air Wing to participate in the germ warfare plan. VMF513 was based at K-8, the airbase of the 3rd Bombardment Group in Gunsan, whose B-26 aircraft had already begun germ warfare operations. VMF513 was provided with ground support services by the 3rd Bombardment Group.

    Although all land-based Marine Corps aircraft (combat types) in Korea were directly under the operational control of the Fifth Air Force, and reported their operations to the 1st Marine Air Wing, the Fifth Air Force usually notified the Wing first out of courtesy when a new or ongoing plan was started.

    In late January 1952, Marine Corps night fighters from the 513th Squadron, using individual aircraft for nighttime armed reconnaissance and carrying germ bombs, shared the targets in the lower half of North Korea with B-26 aircraft, with particular emphasis on the western part. The 513th Squadron cooperated with the 3rd Bombardment Group in all these missions, using F7F (Tigercat) aircraft because they were twin-engine, which was conducive to safety.

    In the event of engine failure, the advantage provided by K-8 base (Gunsan) was the direct flight over the sea, which also provided safety and secrecy for flying over enemy territory via the water.

    For reasons of secrecy, information about the types of bacteria used was not provided to the 1st Marine Air Wing.

    In March 1952, General Hilt was again summoned to the Fifth Air Force Headquarters, and was orally instructed by General Everest to prepare to send the 1st Photographic Squadron (VMJ-1) of the 33rd Air Group of the 1st Marine Air Wing to participate in the plan. VMJ-1 was based at K-3 in Pohang, Korea, with the 33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps, using F2H-2P photographic reconnaissance aircraft (Banshee).

    The missions were intermittent, and combined with ordinary photographic missions, and were arranged by the Fifth Air Force with separate, highly classified orders. The use of Banshee aircraft in the plan was due to their specialized activities, equipment, and facilities, and because the area of activity of the K-3 base was isolated. In terms of enemy defense operations, this aircraft could penetrate deeper into North Korea. They operated in groups of two aircraft, requiring only a minimum number of onboard personnel, and also minimizing disruption to ordinary missions. They could also test high-altitude bombing while conducting photographic flights, flying parallel to the ground.

    In March 1952, Banshee aircraft from the 1st Marine Photographic Squadron began germ warfare operations, continuing and expanding the bombing of North Korean towns with germ bombs, often combining these operations with ordinary photographic missions. Only a minimum supply of bombs was kept on hand to reduce storage problems. The Fifth Air Force sent a team to K-3 base (Pohang), including two officers and several soldiers, to train Marine Corps specialists in how to manage the bombs.

    The part assumed by the Navy in this plan was to use F9F (Panther), AD (Skyraider), and standard F2H (Banshee, but different from the photographic type) aircraft, utilizing aircraft carriers off the east coast of Korea.

    The Air Force also expanded its own operations to include several squadrons using different types of aircraft, and used different methods and tactics to conduct germ warfare.

    This was the situation before I arrived in Korea. The following then occurred.

    The Operational Phase

    In late May 1952, General Jerome, the new Commander of the 1st Marine Air Wing, was summoned to the Fifth Air Force Headquarters, and received an instruction to expand germ warfare operations. This instruction was personally delivered to him orally by General Barcus, the new Commander of the Fifth Air Force.

    The next day, May 25th, General Jerome outlined the new phase of germ warfare operations to the Wing staff at a meeting in his office, which I attended in my capacity as Chief of Staff.

    Other 1st Marine Air Wing staff officers present were: General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., Deputy Commander; Colonel Sterge, Intelligence Officer (G-2); Colonel Winter, Operations Officer (G-3); and Colonel Clark, Logistics Officer (G-4).

    The instructions received from General Barcus and conveyed to us that morning, which we discussed, were as follows:

    Establish a contaminated zone across Korea, in order to make the interdiction plan effective and prevent enemy supplies from reaching the front lines. The Marine Corps was responsible for the left flank of this zone, including the cities of Sinanju and Kunu-ri, and the area between and around these two cities. Other parts of this zone were the responsibility of the Air Force in the center, and the Navy in the east, that is, the right flank.

    The 513th Marine Squadron was to shift from randomly bombing targets to this concentrated target, taking off from K-8 (Gunsan), still serviced by the 3rd Bombardment Group, using F7F (Tigercat) aircraft, because they were twin-engine, which was conducive to safety. This squadron lacked this type of aircraft, but was promised an increase in its number.

    The responsibility for contaminating and maintaining the contamination of the left flank was assigned to the commanders of the 513th Squadron. The schedule of operations was determined by the squadron, but limited to the following range:

    The initial contamination was to be completed as soon as possible; the area was to be re-contaminated or replenished every period, with each period not exceeding ten days.

    The aircraft engaged in these missions were given a standard nighttime armed reconnaissance mission, usually over the Haeju Peninsula. However, on the way to the target, these aircraft would fly through Sinanju or Kunu-ri, drop their germ bombs, and then complete their ordinary mission. This enhanced secrecy and minimized disruption to ordinary missions.

    Reports on maintaining the contaminated zone were submitted directly to the Fifth Air Force, reporting that the nth ordinary mission had been completed, "via Sinanju" or "via Kunu-ri," and stating the number of "Super Propaganda" bombs dropped.

    The 513th Squadron was instructed to "count trucks" at night more precisely than usual, in order to determine or detect any significant changes in vehicle traffic in its area of operation.

    General Barcus also instructed that the 12th Air Group of the 1st Marine Air Wing was to prepare to participate in the germ warfare plan. Initially, AD (Skyraider) aircraft, and later F4U (Corsair) aircraft, were to participate in the expanded plan, but initially only as replacements for F7F aircraft. When assigned missions, these aircraft would take off from their K-6 base in Pyeongtaek, Korea, load bombs at K-8 (the airbase in Gunsan). Later, if formations of aircraft were to be used, specialized bombers could gather with other aircraft in the formation when flying to the target. This was to postpone as much as possible the need to establish a germ bomb supply at K-6 base.

    General Jerome also reported that the Fifth Air Force wanted the 1st Marine Photographic Squadron to continue its current germ warfare operations, taking off from K-3 (Pohang). At the same time, the 33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps at K-3 was placed on a standby "last resort" basis. Because K-3 was remote from the target area, large-scale participation in this plan by the 33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps was not suitable. Because F9F (Panther) aircraft were only used in emergencies, a bomb supply exceeding what was needed for photographic reconnaissance aircraft would no longer be specifically established. If necessary, bombs could be transported from Ulsan in a few hours.

    These plans and their branches were discussed at General Jerome's meeting, and arrangements were made to convey this instruction to the officers involved in implementing this new plan.

    It was decided at that time that Colonel Winter would first convey this information to the relevant commanders, and once the details were formulated, they would be discussed by the informed staff officers.

        Operational Actions of the 1st Marine Air Wing

    513th Night Fighter Squadron of the Marine Corps

    The next day, May 26th, Colonel Winter held a meeting with the commander of the 513th Squadron, and I believe also with the commander of the K-8 airbase and the commander of the 3rd Bombardment Group, and discussed the details.

    Personnel from the Fifth Air Force had been notified directly by the Fifth Air Force Headquarters, so they were already aware of the plan.

    Since this plan was only a change of target for the 513th Squadron, and an additional responsibility to maintain the schedule of contamination of their area, there were no real problems to be solved.

    In the first week of June, the 513th Squadron began operations in the concentrated contaminated zone with cholera bombs.

    (According to the plan obtained by General Jerome, at a later unspecified date—depending on the effects obtained, or lack thereof—yellow fever and typhus might be tried sequentially in the contaminated zone.)

    The 513th Squadron operated in this way throughout the month of June until the first week of July when I was still with the Wing, and there were no unusual events.

    Typically, an average of five aircraft per night targeted the main supply lines along the west coast of Korea as far as the Chongchon River, but with particular emphasis on the area south of Pyongyang. In order to maintain the ten-day re-supply cycle, they turned to Sinanju and Kunu-ri and the area between the two cities as necessary.

    We estimated that if each aircraft carried two germ bombs, two good nights would be enough to take care of Sinanju and Kunu-ri, and a third night would take care of the area around and between the two cities.

    As far as I can remember, around mid-June, the squadron received a modification to the plan from the Fifth Air Force through the 3rd Bombardment Group. This new instruction included an area of about ten miles around the two main cities in the squadron's schedule, with particular emphasis on towns or villages on the supply lines and on any branch roads.

    12th Air Group of the Marine Corps

    Subsequently, Colonel Winter held a meeting at K-6 (Pyeongtaek), attended by Colonel Gallaugher, commander of the 12th Air Group of the Marine Corps, the administrative officer, and the operations officer. Colonel Winter informed them to prepare to participate in the germ warfare operation and to plan for secrecy, because secrecy would become serious if they participated in daytime operations and loaded bombs at their K-6 base. They were to inform the relevant squadron commanders, but in addition, only inform the absolute minimum number of personnel, and to develop a list of a limited number of specially selected pilots to be ready for use at any time. Colonel Winter told them that a team of Air Force personnel would be sent soon to assist in logistical matters. This team actually arrived in the last week of June.

    Before I was captured on July 8th, the AD (Skyraider) and F4U (Corsair) aircraft of the 12th Air Group of the Marine Corps had participated in daytime germ warfare operations once or twice with very few aircraft, as part of regular, scheduled, normal daytime missions, loading bombs at K-8 (Gunsan), and gathering with other aircraft in the formation on the way to the target. These missions targeted small towns along a main highway in western Korea extending south from Kunu-ri, and were also typically part of the interdiction plan.

    33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps

    Around May 27-28, Colonel Winter relayed the plan for the Wing's participation in germ warfare operations to Colonel Congdon, commander of the 33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps.

    Since the Panther (F9F) aircraft of this group at the Pohang base were only used as a last resort, Colonel Congdon was to decide which personnel to convey this information to, but it had to be the absolute minimum.

    During the period that I was with the Wing, none of these aircraft were assigned to germ warfare missions, although the photographic reconnaissance aircraft of the VMJ-1 squadron of this group continued to take off from this base to carry out their missions.

        Scheduling and Secrecy

    Since the operational aspects of germ warfare operations, as well as other operational actions, were controlled by the Fifth Air Force, the most pressing issue related to the 1st Marine Air Wing was secrecy.

    Regarding this issue, absolutely no written material was allowed. The word "bacteria" was not to be mentioned under any circumstances in Korea, except initially for the purpose of identifying "Super Propaganda" or "Super Pro."

    Except for the daily re-supply operations of the 513th Squadron, which did not require scheduling, germ warfare missions were scheduled by separate, highly classified mission orders (these orders were also called "fragmentary" orders). These orders only stated that in mission number so-and-so mentioned in the routine secret "fragmentary" order regarding the day's operations, "Super Propaganda" or "Super Pro" was to be carried.

    Mission reports were sent back in the same way, that is, with separate, highly classified documents, stating the number of "Super Propaganda" bombs dropped in a certain mission.

    In addition to this, the 513th Squadron reported its germ warfare missions by adding "via Kunu-ri" or "via Sinanju" to its usual mission reports.

    Every means was used to deceive the enemy and to keep friendly personnel unaware of these actions. The latter was the most important, because 300 to 400 people in the Wing rotated back to the United States every month.

    Orders were issued that germ bombs could only be dropped together with ordinary bombs or napalm, so that the attacks would appear to be ordinary attacks on supply lines. For extra secrecy when over enemy territory, a napalm bomb was to be kept on the aircraft before the germ bombs were dropped, so that in the event of a plane crash, the evidence could almost certainly be burned.

    All officers were forbidden to discuss this issue unless it was formal and behind closed doors. It was emphasized at every briefing that this was not only a military secret, but also concerned national policy.

    I personally never heard this issue mentioned or even touched upon outside the office. I ate three meals a day in the Commander's private small dining room, where many matters classified as secret were often discussed.

    Estimating Effects

    In the Wing, our unanimous opinion was that the effects of these germ warfare operations could not be accurately estimated. The usual estimation methods were (presumably) using spies, interrogating prisoners of war, paying very close attention to the number of trucks each night to see if there was any difference from the usual number, and observing the public announcements of the Chinese and North Korean authorities. Great credence was given to these public announcements, because we believed that a major epidemic could not be kept from outside knowledge, so the Chinese and North Korean authorities would announce it themselves. The information obtained from the above sources was linked and studied at the level of the Far East Command in Tokyo, but the overall estimate of the effects was not communicated to the level of the Wing, so the Wing did not fully know the effects.

    When I took over from Colonel Binney, I asked him about the effects or reactions known to date, and he said plainly, "Not worth a damn."

    None of the people I knew said that our efforts, risks, and deceptions had achieved the slightest commensurate effect, although the Chinese and North Korean authorities had greatly publicized an earlier use of germ bombs. As far as I knew, the overall effect was disappointing and poor.

        Personal Reactions

    I am not making the following statement to defend anyone, including myself. As an absolutely direct observation, I am only reporting the facts that every officer was both shocked and ashamed when they first heard that the United States was using germ warfare in Korea. I believe that we came to Korea as officers with the unreserved loyalty to our people and government and regarding germ warfare, we believed what we had been frequently told - that germ warfare was only developed for retaliation in a Third World War.

    These officers came to Korea to find that their own government had thoroughly deceived them, still claiming to the world that it was not using germ warfare. This made them mentally question everything else that the government said about the war in general, and especially about the war in Korea.

    None of us believed that germ warfare had any place in war, because of all the weapons designed, only germ bombs have the primary goal of creating casualties among the civilian population—and everyone knew in their conscience that this was completely wrong. The spread of disease is unpredictable, and a fully developed epidemic could be limitless. In addition, secretly using a weapon against unarmed people who have not been warned beforehand gives a terrible feeling of venom and injustice.

    I specifically remember asking Colonel Winter what Colonel Gallaugher's reaction was when he was first notified, and he reported to me that Colonel Gallaugher was stunned and said that he really wanted to "turn in his uniform." Everyone had the same feeling when they first heard it, and their reaction was exactly what the people of an upright and self-respecting nation might have.

    From a tactical point of view, this weapon is completely unnecessary - it is not even a weapon of the Marine Corps - and from a moral point of view, it is itself a sin from which there is no return; from an administrative and logistical point of view, it is hopeless according to the current planned method of use; and from the point of view of self-respect and loyalty, it is shameful.

    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之一：主要供词
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校弗兰克·赫·许威布尔供词之一：主要供词。
    我是弗兰克·赫·许威布尔上校，04429。至一九五二年七月八日我被击落并被俘时止，我是海军陆战队第一空军联队的参谋长。
    我自一九二九年开始在海军陆战队中服役，一九三一年被任命为航空员，在世界许多地方担任过任务。在我到朝鲜之前，我曾在海军陆战队总部的航空处值勤。
    参谋长联席
    会议的指示
    我于一九五二年四月十日到达朝鲜，来担任我作为海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长的职务。我的一切指示和决定都必须由副司令莱姆逊—斯克里布纳将军批准。在我完全担负起参谋长的职责前，莱姆逊—斯克里布纳将军把我召到他的办公室去讨论联队的各种问题。在会谈中，他说：“宾涅告诉了你VMF—513的特别任务的所有背景了没有？”我问他是否就是指“超级宣传”而言（这就是我们替细菌弹所起的密码名称），他证实了这一点。我告诉他，宾涅已经把一切背景告诉我了。
    由我接替他任参谋长的军官，阿瑟·阿·宾涅上校，按照他的职责所要求的那样，告诉了我关于在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划的轮廓，以及关于海军陆战队第一空军联队迄该时止所负责的一部分的细节。
    在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划，是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。在那一月，参谋长联席会议特派专人送给远东司令部总司令（当时是李奇微将军）一个指示，命令在朝鲜开始细菌战，最初是在一个小的、试验性的阶段，但是渐渐扩大。
    这个指示被传达给驻在东京的远东空军司令威兰将军。威兰将军于是亲自召集了在朝鲜的第五航空队司令埃弗雷斯特将军，以及在远东空军直接指挥下作战的、驻在冲绳岛的第十九轰炸机联队司令官，举行会议。
    那一计划（我现在即将加以概述的）经过了研究，对于问题的大的方面取得了协议；而下述情报则由埃弗雷斯特将军亲自并口头地带回朝鲜，因为为了保密的目的，决定在朝鲜关于此事不得有可能被俘获的任何书面东西。
        目　标
    当时的基本目标是在实地的情况下试验细菌战的各种不同的因素，并在日后，视所得的结果以及朝鲜的形势，可能把实地的试验扩大成为正规作战行动中的一部分。
    各种可用的疾病的效果要加以试验，特别是它们在不同情况下的蔓延性或传染性，也要试验每一种疾病是否严重地破坏敌人的行动或平民的日常工作，或是只引起次要的不方便，或者完全可以加以控制而不造成困难。要在实地的情况下，要试验不同种类的军器或容器，并使用不同类型的飞机来试验它们作为携带细菌弹的工具的适合性。
    要加以试验的地形包括高原、海岸地带、空旷地区、山谷地区、孤立地区、相互毗连的地区、大小市镇、聚集在一起的城市以及相当分散的城市。各种可能的地区或是地区的各种可能的组合，都要加以试验。
    这些试验要延续多久，并未说明，但要足以包括朝鲜的一切极冷和极热的气温。
    一切可能的投掷办法要加以试验，并且要发展战术，包括起初仅是夜间袭击，其后扩大为由专门的中队进行日间袭击。各种式样的轰炸都要试验一下，各种轰炸由单独一架飞机直到成群结队的飞机进行轰炸，都要试验一下，而细菌弹要与惯用的炸弹同时使用。
    特别要用一切可能的办法来试验和观察敌人的反应，以探知他的对策是什么，他将采取什么宣传步骤，以及这种战争对他的军事行动起了何种程度的影响。
    保密措施要彻底加以试验——既对友方又对敌方。对于友方，要采取一切可能的步骤来限制关于使用这种武器的消息并控制关于这个问题的情报。对于敌方，要用一切手段来欺骗敌人，阻止他实际证明这种武器正被使用。
    最后，如果情况有此需要，可按参谋长联席会议的指示，把试验阶段的细菌战扩大成为在朝鲜的军事或战术行动的一部分。最初的阶段
    从冲绳岛起飞的B—29型飞机自一九五一年十一月开始使用细菌弹，对北朝鲜所有的目标采取一种可以称为随意轰炸的办法。头一天夜里的目标可能在朝鲜东北部，第二天夜里可能在朝鲜的西北部。它们掷细菌弹的行动是与寻常的夜间武装侦察结合起来进行的，作为一种经济和保密的办法。
    一九五二年一月初，当时海军陆战队第一空军联队司令希尔特将军被召到在汉城的第五航空队总部去。在那里，埃弗雷斯特将军告诉他参谋长联席会议发出的指示，并命令他派海军陆战队第一空军联队第三十三空军大队第五一三夜间战斗机中队——VMF513参加细菌战计划。VMF513以K—8为基地，这是第三轰炸机联队在群山的空军基地，该联队的B—26型飞机已经开始了细菌战的行动。VMF513由第三轰炸机联队给予地勤方面的服务。
    虽然一切在朝鲜以陆地为基地的海军陆战队的飞机（作战类型）都直属第五航空队作战，并以它们的行动报告海军陆战队第一空军联队，但是为了表示礼貌，当一个新的或是在进行中的计划开始的时候，第五航空队通常先通知联队。
    一九五二年一月底，五一三中队的海军陆战队夜间战斗机，以单独的飞机作夜间的武装侦察，携带细菌弹，与B—26型飞机分担北朝鲜下半部的目标，特别着重于西边的一部分。五一三中队在所有这些任务中与第三轰炸机联队配合，使用F7F型飞机（虎猫式），因为它们是双引擎的，有利于安全。
    在引擎发生故障时，K—8基地（群山）所提供的好处是直接飞到海面上，它也提供了经过水面飞临敌区的安全与保密。
    为了保密的原因，关于所用的细菌种类的情报不提供给海军陆战队第一空军联队。
    一九五二年三月，希尔特将军又被召到第五航空队总部去，并由埃弗雷斯特将军口头指示他准备派海军陆战队第一空军联队第三十三空军大队第一照相中队（VMJ—1）参预计划。VMJ—1以海军陆战队第三十三空军大队在朝鲜浦项的K—3为基地，使用F2H—2P型的照相侦察机（女妖式）。
    任务是断断续续的，并且与寻常的照相任务结合起来，并由第五航空队以单独的、绝密的命令来布置。在计划中起用女妖式飞机，是因为它们的专门性的活动、器材和设备，以及因为K—3基地这个活动的地区是隔离的。就敌方的防御行动而论，这种飞机能更深入北朝鲜。它们以两架飞机为一组而进行工作，只须最少数的机上人员，而对于寻常的任务也尽少扰乱。它们也能在进行照相飞行，与地面平行飞行时，试行从高空投弹。
    在一九五二年三月，海军陆战队第一照相中队的女妖式飞机开始细菌战行动，以继续并扩大用细菌弹轰炸北朝鲜的城镇，而时常把这些行动与寻常的照相任务结合起来。手头只保持最低限度的炸弹供应，以减少储存的问题。第五航空队派了一队人到K—3基地来（浦项），其中包括两名军官及几名士兵，以便教练海军陆战队的专门人员如何管理炸弹。
    海军在这个计划中所担负的部分是使用F9F型（豹式）、AD型（空中侵略者式）以及标准的F2H型（女妖式，但与照相用的一类不同）飞机，利用朝鲜东海岸外的航空母舰。
    空军也扩大了它本身的行动以包括几个使用不同种类飞机的中队，并用不同的方法和战术来进行细菌战。
    这就是我到达朝鲜前的情况。其后发生了下述的事情。作战的阶段
    在一九五二年五月下旬，海军陆战队第一空军联队的新司令杰罗姆将军被召到第五航空队总部去，并接到一个扩大细菌战行动的指示。这个指示是由第五航空队的新司令巴克斯将军亲自口头传达给他的。
    次日，五月二十五日，杰罗姆将军在他办公室里的一个会议上向联队参谋部概述了细菌战行动的新阶段，我以参谋长的身份出席了这次会。
    出席的其他海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋部人员是：莱姆逊—斯克里布纳将军，副司令；斯特奇上校，情报官员（G—2）；温特上校，作战官员
    （G—3）以及克拉克上校，后勤官员（G—4）。
    从巴克斯将军那里得来，在那天早晨传达给我们并由我们讨论的指示如下：
    横贯朝鲜建立一个沾染地带，为的是使阻击计划生效，制止敌人的供应到达前线。海军陆战队负责这个地带的左翼，包括新安州与军隅里两城以及在这两城之间和周围的地区。这个地带的其他部分，由空军负责中部，海军负责东部，也即右翼。
    海军陆战队第五一三中队要由随意轰击的目标转向这个集中的目标，自K—8（群山）起飞，仍由第三轰炸机联队给予服务，使用F7F型（虎猫式）飞机，因为它们是双引擎的，有利于安全。这个中队缺乏这种飞机，但已得到承诺可增加其数量。
    使左翼沾染并保持其被沾染的责任被指派给五一三中队的指挥官们，行动的时间表由中队决定，但限于下列范围之内：
    最初的一次沾染要尽早完成；以不超出十日为一期，每一期这个地区要重新沾染一次或重新补充一次。
    从事这些任务的飞机被给予一个标准的夜间武装侦察任务，通常是在海州半岛。但是在飞向目标途中，这些飞机将飞经新安州或军隅里，投下它们的细菌弹，然后再完成它们的寻常任务。这样既增强保密，又尽少扰乱寻常任务。
    关于维持沾染地带的报告直接交给第五航空队，报告第某某次寻常任务已经完成，“途经新安州”或“途经军隅里”，并说明投下了多少枚“超级宣传”弹。
    五一三中队得到指示，要比寻常更为精确地在夜间“点数载重汽车”，以便决定或探察在其活动地区的车辆交通有无任何重要的改变。
    巴克斯将军也指示说，海军陆战队第一空军联队第十二空军大队要准备参预细菌战计划。起初是AD型（空中侵略者式）飞机，其后是F4U型（海盗式）飞机，都要参加扩大的计划，但是最初只是替代F7F型飞机。在被指派任务时，这些飞机从它们在朝鲜平泽的K—6基地起飞，在K—8（在群山的空军基地）装载炸弹。其后，如要用成队的飞机，则专门的轰炸机可在飞赴目标时与编队中的其他飞机聚集在一起。这是要尽可能地延迟在K—6基地建立一个细菌炸弹供应的必要。
    杰罗姆将军又报告说，第五航空队要海军陆战队第一照相中队继续它们目前的细菌战行动，自K—3（浦项）起飞。同时，在K—3的海军陆战队第三十三空军大队被置于随时待命的“万不得已”的基础上。由于K—3距离目标地区遥远，因此海军陆战队第三十三空军大队大规模地参加这个计划是不相宜的。由于F9F型（豹式）飞机只是在紧急的时候使用，因此不再特别建立超出照相侦察飞机所需要的炸弹供应。假如有必要，炸弹可以在几小时内自蔚山运到。
    这些计划及其枝节都在杰罗姆将军的会议上讨论了，并作了布置来把这个指示传达给与执行这个新计划有关的一些军官。
    当时决定先由温特上校把这个情报传达给有关的指挥官，一旦细节制定以后再由知情的参谋部军官加以讨论。
        海军陆战队第一空军联队的作战行动海军陆战队第五一三夜间战斗机中队
    次日，五月二十六日，温特上校与五一三中队的指挥官，我相信还有K—8空军基地指挥官以及第三轰炸机联队的司令，举行会议，并讨论了各项细节。
    第五航空队的人员已直接由第五航空队总部通知，因此已经知悉这个计划。
    由于这个计划对五一三中队来说只是改变了一下目标，并额外负责保持沾染它们的地区的时间表，因此没有什么真正要解决的问题。
    在六月的第一周，五一三中队就用霍乱弹在集中的沾染地带开始行动。
    （根据杰罗姆将军所得到的计划，在日后一个未具体规定的日期——视所得的效果，或毫无效果——可能在沾染地带次第试用黄热病及斑疹伤寒。）
    在六月整个月直到我尚在联队的七月第一周，五一三中队就是这样行动的，并无异常的事件。
    通常每夜平均有五架飞机针对沿朝鲜西海岸直到清川江的主要供应线，但是特别着重于平壤以南的地区。为了保持十天重新补充一次的周期，它们视必要而转向新安州和军隅里以及两城之间的地区。
    我们估计，如果每一架飞机带两枚细菌弹，两个好晚上就足以解决新安州和军隅里，第三个晚上就可以解决两城周围和之间的地区。
    按我记忆所及，约在六月中旬，中队通过第三轰炸机联队自第五航空队接到了对计划的一个修改。这个新指示把两个主要城市周围约十哩的地区包括在中队的日程表中，特别着重于在供应线上的及在任何支路上的城镇或乡村。海军陆战队第十二空军大队
    其后，温特上校在K—6（平泽）举行了一个会议，出席的有海军陆战队第十二空军大队的指挥官盖洛上校，行政官员及作战官员。温特上校通知他们作准备，以便参预细菌战行动，并筹划保密问题，因为如果他们参加日间的行动并在他们的K—6基地装载炸弹的话，保密问题将严重起来。他们要通知有关的中队指挥官们，但是此外只能通知绝对最少数目的人员，还要制定一个有限数目的特选的驾驶员名单，以便随时准备使用。温特上校告诉他们，不久会派一队空军人员来在后勤问题上予以协助。这一队人实际上在六月的最后一周就来到了。
    在我于七月八日被俘前，海军陆战队第十二空军大队的AD型（空中侵略者式）及F4U型（海盗式）飞机都以极少的架数参加过一次或两次日间的细菌战行动，作为正规的、按日程表进行的、正常日间任务的一部分，在K—8（群山）装载炸弹，并在飞赴目标途中与编队中的其他飞机聚集在一起。这些任务是针对朝鲜西部沿着从军隅里向南的一条主要公路上的一些小市镇的，也是通常阻击计划中的一部分。海军陆战队第三十三空军大队
    约在五月二十七至二十八日，温特上校把联队参加细菌战行动的计划转告了海军陆战队第三十三空军大队的指挥官康登上校。
    既然这个大队在浦项基地上的豹式（F9F）飞机只是万不得已才使用的，因此就由康登上校来决定究竟把这个情报传达给那些人员，但是必须是绝对的少数。
    在我尚在联队的时期内，这些飞机中没有一架被交给了细菌战的任务，虽然这个大队的VMJ—1中队的照像侦察机继续从这个基地起飞以进行其任务。
        安排日程表及保密
    由于细菌战的作战行动方面以及其他作战行动都是由第五航空队控制的，因此与海军陆战队第一空军联队有关的最为紧迫的问题就是保密。
    关于这个问题，绝对不许有书面的东西。“细菌”字样是不得在任何情况下在朝鲜提及的，除非是最初为了识别“超级宣传”或“超宣”。
    除了五一三中队日常的重新补充的行动不需要安排日程表之外，细菌战的任务是由单独的、绝密的、关于任务的命令来安排的（这些命令也称“分”令）。这些命令只说，在关于当天行动的例行秘密“分”令中所提到的第某某次任务中，要携带“超级宣传”或“超宣”。
    关于任务的报告用同样的办法传回去，就是用单独的、绝密的公文，说明在某一次任务中所投下的“超级宣传”弹的数目。
    除此以外，五一三中队报告其细菌战任务的办法是在其通常的任务报告中附加“途经军隅里”或“途经新安州”。
    采用一切办法来欺骗敌人并且不使友方人员知道关于这些行动的消息。而后者是最重要的，因为联队中每月有三百至四百人轮换回美国。
    已经发出了命令：细菌弹只能与通常的炸弹或凝固汽油弹一起投下，以使袭击显得是通常的对供应线的袭击。为了在敌区上空时的额外保密，在投完细菌弹前要在飞机上保留一枚凝固汽油弹，以便万一飞机堕毁，就几乎一定
    可以焚毁证据。
    所有的军官都被禁止讨论这个问题，除非是正式的并且是关起门来谈。每
    次发简令时都要强调，这不但是军事秘密，并且有关国家政策。
    我个人从来没有在办公室之外听到提及或甚至涉及这个问题，我一天三餐
    都是在司令的私人小饭厅吃的，而在那里是常讨论许多被列为秘密的事项的。估计效果
    在联队中，我们一致的意见是，这些细菌战行动的效果是不能精确地加以估计的。通常估计的办法是（据推测）使用间谍，审询战俘，很仔细地注意每夜载重汽车的数量，以观察是否与通常的数量有异，并观察朝中当局的公开宣告。对于这些公开宣告是予以极大的信赖的，因为我们认为，发生了大的流行病是不可能不被外界知道的，因此朝中当局就会自行宣布。从以上来源所取得的情报是由在东京的远东总司令这一级来加以联系和研究的，但是对于效果的总的估计，是不传达到联队这一级来的，因此联队对于效果并不完全知道。
    当我接替宾涅上校的时候，我曾问他迄今已知的效果或反应，他明白地说：“屁都不值。”
    我所认识的人中，没有一人说我们的努力、冒险和诈欺已经取得了丝毫相称的效果，虽然朝中当局对于早先的使用细菌弹的行动曾大大地作过一次公开报告。据我所知，总的效果是令人失望和不佳的。
        个人反应
    我不是要为任何人，包括我自己在内辩护而作如下的叙述。作为绝对的直接观察所得，我只是据实报告说，每一个军官在第一次听说美国正在朝鲜使用细菌战时，都是既震惊又羞惭。我相信，我们作为军官到朝鲜来，都是毫无例外地效忠于我们的人民和政府的，关于细菌战，我们也相信我们经常被告知的——那就是，细菌战只是为了在第三次世界大战中作报复之用才加以发展的。
    这些军官来到朝鲜后，发觉他们自己的政府彻底地欺骗了他们，仍然向世界宣称它没有使用细菌战。这样就使他们在思想上怀疑政府一般地关于战争所说的所有其他事情，特别是关于朝鲜的战争。
    我们之间没有一人相信，在战争中细菌战有任何地位，因为在一切设计出来的武器中，只有细菌弹是以在平民大众中制造伤亡为主要目标的——而这是每一个人在良心上都知道是彻底错误的。疾病的蔓延是不可预测的，一个充分展开了的流行病，可能是漫无边际的。此外，偷偷地以一种武器来对付赤手空拳、而又事先未获警告的人民，令人有一种可怕的阴毒和不公正的感觉。
    我具体地记得问过温特上校，当盖洛上校第一次得到通知时的反应如何，他向我报告说，盖洛上校吃惊得目瞪口呆，并且说他真想“退还他的制服”。每人在第一次听说的时候，都有同样的感觉，而他们的反应也正是一个正直和自尊的国家的人民所可能有的反应。
    从战术上说，这种武器是完全不必要的——它甚至不是海军陆战队的一种武器——，从道义上说，它本身就是永劫不复之罪，从行政上和后勤工作上说，按照目前计划的使用办法，它是毫无希望的，从自尊和忠诚的观点来说，它是可耻的。弗兰克·赫·许威布尔（签名）（军号）04429美国海军陆战队上校一九五二年十二月六日
