Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The confessions of captured American senior officers, Haywood, staff officer of the First Marine Air Wing, and Bleile, ordnance officer, regarding the U.S. Air Force's bacteriological warfare in Korea, have placed the murdering U.S. government in an inescapable situation. Following the publication of Haywood's confession on February 22nd, a strange silence has been maintained from Washington to Tokyo. It was not until the 24th that Clark, commander-in-chief of the invading U.S. forces in Korea, braced himself and issued a statement of outright denial. It is clear that what forced Clark to come out and deny was that the confessions of these two senior American officers provided conclusive evidence and very specific details, making it impossible not to believe. These undeniable facts left Clark in a very bad state, and he was obviously unable to deny them; therefore, he decided to completely avoid discussing the content of the confessions. While Clark had to admit that Haywood and Bleile were U.S. Air Force personnel and that the confessions were statements they made, he tried to make people believe that this was the first time U.S. Air Force personnel had confessed to the U.S. conducting bacteriological warfare, and that these confessions were "fabricated."

However, the whole world knows that before Haywood and Bleile, four captured U.S. Air Force personnel had already confessed to the crime of the U.S. conducting bacteriological warfare. These four people are: Lieutenant Oenack and Lieutenant Quinn of the U.S. Air Force's Third Bombardment Wing, and Lieutenant O'Neill and Lieutenant Kness of the Eighteenth Fighter-Bomber Group. From the confessions of these six U.S. Air Force personnel, the whole world can clearly see every step of this heinous bacteriological warfare, from planning to implementation. All six of these captured U.S. Air Force personnel admitted that the reason they confessed to the U.S. government's bacteriological warfare was because this evil crime against humanity condemned their consciences. Haywood admitted in his confession that "every officer was shocked and ashamed when they first heard that the U.S. was using bacteriological warfare in Korea." Haywood admitted that the use of bacteriological weapons "is, morally speaking, a crime of eternal damnation in itself"; "from the standpoint of self-esteem and loyalty, it is shameful." Clark is now trying to stamp a "fabricated" label on all the truths admitted by these enlightened U.S. Air Force personnel, but he does not dare to offer any defense against any point in the confessions.

Clark himself knows that such weak denials cannot cover up the American bacteriological warfare crimes, so he has to resort to the last trick, slandering that the Chinese and Korean side published the confessions of Haywood and Bleile in order to "cover up" the "badly managed" public health work. But this slander does not mitigate Clark's guilt. The great achievements of the Chinese and Korean people in the patriotic health campaign to defeat American bacteriological warfare are already well-known facts. The real purpose of Clark's slander is to provide cover for the bacteriological warfare that the U.S. is still conducting and will continue to conduct.

    被俘美国高级军官的供词提供了十分确凿的证据
    克拉克无耻狡赖不能掩饰美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十七日讯】被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长许威布尔和军械官布莱关于美国空军在朝鲜进行细菌战的供词，已经使谋杀犯美国政府陷于无处逃遁的境地。许威布尔的供词在二月二十二日发表以后，从华盛顿到东京一直保持着奇怪的沉默。直到二十四日，才由侵朝美军总司令克拉克硬着头皮出来发表了一个矢口抵赖的声明。很明显，迫使克拉克出来抵赖的，是因为这两个美国高级军官的供词提供了十分确凿的证据和十分具体的细节，使人不能不相信。这些不容抵赖的事实使克拉克狼狈不堪，他显然是无法否认；因此，他决定完全避开供词内容不谈。克拉克一方面不得不承认许威布尔和布莱是美国空军人员，承认供词是他们陈述的，一方面却企图使人相信这是第一次美国空军人员供认美国进行细菌战，企图使人相信这些供词是“伪造”的。
    可是，全世界都知道，在许威布尔和布莱之前，早已有四个被俘的美国空军人员供认了关于美国进行细菌战的罪行。这四个人就是：美国空军第三轰炸机联队的伊纳克中尉、奎恩中尉，第十八战斗轰炸机大队的奥尼尔中尉、克尼斯中尉。从这六个美国空军人员的供词中，全世界已经可以清楚地看到这个罪恶的细菌战从计划到实施的每一个步骤。所有这六个被俘的美国空军人员，全都承认他们之所以供出美国政府进行细菌战的事实，是因为这种万恶的反人类的罪行使他们的良心受到谴责。许威布尔在他的供词中承认，“每一个军官在第一次听说美国正在朝鲜使用细菌战时，都是既震惊又羞惭。”许威布尔承认，使用细菌武器，“从道义上说，它本身就是永劫不复之罪”；“从自尊和忠诚的观点来说，它是可耻的”。克拉克现在企图把这些觉悟了的美国空军人员所承认的全部真情盖上一个“伪造”的戳子，却又不敢对供词中的任何一点提出任何辩解。
    克拉克自己也知道，这样一些软弱无力的狡赖并不能掩饰美国的细菌战罪行，他就只好使出最后的一手，诬蔑朝中方面发表许威布尔和布莱的供词是为了“掩饰”“办得一塌糊涂”的公共卫生工作。但是这种诽谤并不能减轻克拉克的罪责。中朝人民在打败美国细菌战的爱国卫生运动中取得的巨大成绩，已经是尽人皆知的事实。克拉克发出这种诬蔑，真正的目的是企图替美国仍在并还要继续进行的细菌战作掩护。
