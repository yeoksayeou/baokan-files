Kim Il-sung ordered the male and female guerrillas to continuously strengthen their ranks and actively strike the enemy.

Kim Il-sung ordered: In order to grandly commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, on February 8th, 240 artillery pieces will be fired 20 times in Pyongyang, Nampo, Wonsan, and Hamhung to pay tribute to the commanders and fighters of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
