The task of technical education in the winter training of basic construction workers is: in a short period of time, to enable workers to master at least the advanced experience of their own field, and to understand the responsibility system, quality standards, technical operating procedures, and technical safety regulations that are closely related to their work. Due to the lack of workers with special skills and those who master mechanized construction, special attention must be paid to training technical workers in these two areas. All of this is to improve the technical level of workers in general, to strengthen the construction force, and to adapt to the needs of basic construction projects. Therefore, whether technical education is done well or not has a very important role in completing this year's construction tasks.

How can we do a good job in technical education? We believe that:

I. Preparation must be done well.

If you want to achieve the expected results of technical education, you must formulate a realistic teaching plan before the end of political education, select teachers, summarize advanced operating methods, compile concise and easy-to-understand technical theory textbooks, and prepare the materials and tools needed for teaching and operation demonstrations. This is the main condition to ensure the success of technical education. Only when the preparatory work is done well can technical education proceed smoothly. When formulating the technical education plan, the Second Engineering Office of Fushun City determined to first study prefabrication and installation when steel and concrete workers learn advanced experience, based on the increased mechanized construction this year. Considering that the riveting and welding workers of the electromechanical installation engineering team of Fushun Machinery Repair Factory were too few and were all below level four, they paid special attention to the training of riveting and welding workers when formulating the teaching plan. This approach of actively relying on one's own efforts to train technical workers to meet the needs of national construction projects is correct. The Liaoxi Provincial Construction Workers Winter Training Backbone Training Class made very careful preparations in terms of teaching materials, teachers, and class organization. For example, they first learned about the situation of the technical personnel, and then selected those with certain technical theoretical knowledge and who could master advanced experience as technical teachers; they asked technical personnel and advanced producers to carefully study and then compile teaching materials; and they fully prepared the bricks, lime, sand, and demonstration sites needed for technical demonstrations, etc. However, some winter training classes did not do a good job of preparation. When technical education started, they only grabbed what they could find, which delayed the time for technical education. For example, the winter training school in Changdianpu, Anshan, only issued a few drawings and asked the workers to study them themselves. The workers said, "It is a good thing to give us drawings to read, but it is like giving them to the blind. We can stare at them until we are old and still not understand!" As a result, they had to postpone the technical classes and start preparing from scratch.

II. Ideological leadership must continue to be strengthened.

Experience has proven that strengthening ideological leadership is the key to doing a good job in learning. However, some leading cadres in the current winter training classes believe that: "Now that we are having technical classes, we can relax the political work." Some leading cadres also believe that: "Workers are willing to learn technology, so we don't need to do political work or ideological leadership in technical education." These ideas are obviously wrong. Because there are still many wrong ideas among the workers that hinder them from learning technology. The main ones are:

1.  Complacency and conservative ideas. Some workers say: "The double-hand squeezing method is just a piece of window paper (meaning that they see through it)." "There is nothing to advanced experience, I understand it at a glance." "Implementing the assembly line method is not as fast as working alone." There are quite a few people with this kind of thinking.

2.  The individual labor thinking of small producers. Some workers do not yet understand that in large-scale economic construction, they will gradually move towards mechanized and factory-based construction. Therefore, some apprentices said after seeing Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line method: "It's good, but my family wants me to learn carpentry. If I learn this way, won't I become a hole-punching expert? If I go home in the future, I won't even be able to make a pot lid, what kind of carpenter would that be?" Some said: "If we leave here and go somewhere else in the future, will people open a hole-punching factory for us?"

3.  The idea of ​​disregarding technical theory or practical operation. Some workers say: "It is useless for workers to learn technical theory. Theory is a matter for technical personnel, we workers just need to be able to do the work." On the contrary, some old technical workers only want to learn theoretical knowledge, but are unwilling to learn practical operation. They do not understand that only when technical theory is combined with operating experience can technology be further improved and the quality of the project be guaranteed.

4.  The idea of ​​learning that does not start from the needs of national projects. For example, some workers are unwilling to learn masonry but are willing to learn carpentry, feeling that masonry is dirty and tiring, and not as clean and light as carpentry, etc.

The above-mentioned erroneous ideas hinder workers from learning technology. We must tirelessly conduct communist education for them, spread the advanced ideas of advanced people to them more, and continuously improve their political consciousness and learning enthusiasm, so as to achieve the expected results of technical education in a short period of time.

III. Pay attention to teaching methods.

Teaching methods must be suitable for the workers' ideology, culture, and technical level. According to current preliminary experience, the following points should be noted:

First, less lecturing, more questioning, more discussion, and more tutoring. This is a teaching method that is very popular among workers. Because the cultural and technical level of basic construction workers is relatively low, in order for workers to learn a little and remember a little, it is very necessary to adopt a simple and easy-to-understand teaching method. The pipeline class of the Changdianpu Winter Training School in Anshan adopted this method and achieved good results. The workers said: "With this teaching method, we listen to the lectures carefully and discuss them carefully."

Second, learn while teaching and teach each other. This is also a practical and helpful method for students to learn. After the measurement class of the Changdianpu Winter Training School in Anshan finished teaching the measurement course, they led the students to the site for practical operation, guiding them while operating, and helping the students apply the theory to practical operation. They also organized students with high cultural levels to teach those with low levels, and those with high technical skills to teach those with low technical skills, which not only enabled workers who could not keep up to catch up, but also enabled workers who made rapid progress to understand the course more deeply by helping others.

Third, visual education. In technical education, the most difficult thing for students is not understanding drawings and drawing symbols, not understanding nouns and terms, and not understanding calculation methods. Therefore, teachers must use charts and models to make popular explanations of many technical principles, otherwise, it will make students more and more confused.

Fourth, organize technical demonstrations. Some workers still doubt the superiority of advanced experience. To eliminate this doubt, organizing demonstrations of advanced tools and advanced operating methods, especially organizing comparative demonstrations of new and old operating methods, is the most effective method. Some units organize workers to evaluate, analyze, and study after organizing comparative demonstrations of new and old operating methods, and then technical personnel explain them theoretically, which has a greater effect.

In addition, in technical education, we should also pay attention to doing a good job in technical appraisal at any time, so as to lay the foundation for future skill testing.

    对基本建设工人冬训中技术教育的几点意见
    东北总工会基本建设工作委员会
    基本建设工人冬季训练中技术教育的任务是：在很短的时间内，使工人至少掌握自己这一门的先进经验，晓得与自己工种有密切关连的责任制、质量标准、技术操作规程和技术安全规程。由于缺乏特殊工种和掌握机械化施工的工人，又必须特别注意培养这两方面的技术工人。这一切都是为了把工人的技术水平普遍提高一步，以壮大施工力量，适应基本建设工程的需要。因此技术教育做得好或坏，对完成今年施工任务有着极重要的作用。
    怎样才能做好技术教育工作呢？我们认为：
    一、必须做好准备工作
    要想使技术教育收到预期的效果，必须在政治教育结束之前，制订出切合实际的教学计划，选择教员，总结先进操作方法，编写简明易懂的技术理论教材，准备好在教学和操作表演时所需要的材料和工具。这是保证搞好技术教育的主要条件。只有准备工作做好了，技术教育才能顺利进行。抚顺市第二工程处在制订技术教育计划时，根据今年机械化施工增加的情况，确定在钢筋混凝土工人学习先进经验时，首先学习预制安装。抚顺机械修理厂考虑到机电安装工程队的铆焊工人太少，并且都是四级以下的工人，在制订教学计划时，就特别注意了铆、焊工人的培养。这种以积极的自力更生的办法来培养技术工人，以满足国家建设工程需要的做法是正确的。辽西省建筑工人冬训骨干训练班在教材、教员、编班等方面，作了很细致的准备。譬如，事先了解技术人员情况，然后选择具有一定的技术理论知识，又能掌握先进经验的人作技术教员；请技术人员和先进生产者精心研究后，才编写教材；充分准备技术表演所需要的砖、灰、沙子和表演地点等等。但是，有的冬季训练班没有做好准备工作，等到技术教育开始后，才现用现抓，因而推延了技术教育时间。如鞍山长甸堡的冬季训练学校，只发了几张图纸，让工人自己研究。工人说：“给我们图纸看倒是件好事，可是给了瞎子了。咱们看到老还不是白瞪眼！”结果不得不延期上技术课，从头做准备工作。
    二、必须继续加强思想领导
    经验证明，加强思想领导是搞好学习的关键。但是目前有些冬训班的领导干部却认为：“现在上技术课了，政治工作可以松些啦。”还有的领导干部认为：“工人都愿意学技术，在技术教育中不做政治工作，没有思想领导也行了。”这些想法显然都是错误的。因为在工人中还存在着很多的错误想法，阻碍着他们学习技术。主要的如：
    一、自满情绪和保守思想。有的工人说：“双手挤浆法是一层窗户纸（意即看透了）。”“先进经验没有啥，我一看就懂了。”“实行流水作业法还不如单干快。”有这种思想的人不在少数。
    二、小生产者个体劳动的思想。有些工人还不懂得在大规模经济建设当中，将逐步走向施工机械化和工厂化。因此，有的徒工看了谢万福木工流水作业法就说：“好是好，可是家里是让我来学木匠的。这样学法，不是要学成个打眼专家了吗？将来回家连个锅盖都不会做，还叫啥木匠呢？”有的说：“将来离开这里到别处去，人家还会为咱们开一个打眼工厂吗？”
    三、轻视技术理论或轻视实际操作的思想。有的工人说：“工人学习技术理论没有用。理论是技术人员的事，咱们工人会干就行。”与此相反，有些老技术工人只愿学理论知识，而不愿学实际操作。他们不懂得：只有技术理论与操作经验相结合，技术才能更加提高，工程质量才有保证。
    四、不从国家工程需要出发的学习思想。如有的工人不愿意学习瓦工而愿意学木工，觉得瓦工又脏又累，不如木工干净、轻便等等。
    上述种种错误思想，妨碍着工人学习技术。必须毫不疲倦地向他们进行共产主义教育，多多向他们传播先进人物的先进思想，不断提高他们的政治觉悟和学习积极性，才能在短期内收到技术教育的预期效果。
    三、注意教学方法
    教学方法必须适合工人的思想、文化和技术水平。根据目前的初步经验，应该注意如下几点：
    第一、少讲、多问、多讨论、多辅导。这是很受工人欢迎的一种教学方法。因为基本建设工人的文化、技术水平比较低，为使工人学一点能记住一点，采取简明易懂的讲课方法是十分必要的。鞍山长甸堡冬训学校管道班采用了这样的方法，收效很好。工人说：“这样教法，我们听课认真了，讨论也细致了。”
    第二、边教边学、互教互学。这也是一种切合实际的、帮助学员学习的好方法。鞍山长甸堡冬训学校测量班讲完测量课程后，就领着学员到现场去实际操作，一边操作一边指导，帮助学员把理论运用到实际操作中去。他们又组织文化水平高的学员教水平低的，技术高的教技术低的，不仅使原来跟不上的工人跟了上来，而且使进步快的工人通过帮助别人更深入地理解了课程。
    第三、形象教育。在技术教育中，学员们最感困难的是看不懂图纸和图纸符号，听不懂名词术语，弄不清计算方法。因此，教员必须把技术上的许多道理，通过挂图和模型作通俗的说明，否则会使学员越听越糊涂。
    第四、组织技术表演。有些工人现在还怀疑先进经验的优越性。要消除这种怀疑，组织先进工具与先进操作方法的表演，特别是组织新旧操作法对比表演，是最有效的一种方法。有的单位在组织新旧操作法对比表演以后，还组织工人评比，分析研究，技术人员再从理论上加以说明，收效更大。
    此外，在技术教育中，还应该注意随时做好技术鉴定工作，以便给将来考工打下基础。
