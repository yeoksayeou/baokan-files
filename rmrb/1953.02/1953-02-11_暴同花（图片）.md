    VII. This year, the family planted two mu of cotton. Bao Tonghua got up early and worked late, participating in many major tasks from planting to harvesting the cotton. She wanted to make a new cotton-padded coat for her child in the winter. However, after the cotton was picked, her mother-in-law picked out the good ones, leaving her with just over a pound of rotten cotton. Bao Tonghua felt very sad.

    VIII. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could no longer live together, and had to separate the household. Bao Tonghua thought, wouldn't it be better for the two of us to live together without getting angry? Unexpectedly, her husband treated her the same as before. Life was difficult, they couldn't eat enough or dress warmly, and her husband would scold her at every turn, talk about selling her, and often beat her. Bao Tonghua cried until her face was sallow.

    IX. The relationship between husband and wife was not good, and neither of them had the energy to produce properly. They didn't apply manure to the fields, and the weeds grew as tall as corn.

    X. In 1947, Lushan was liberated. A female comrade from the village came and often gathered the young women in the village for meetings. She said that men and women should be equal, and women have the right to participate in various social works. The more Bao Tonghua listened, the more she felt it was right, and felt that women had a way out.

    XI. Therefore, she often participated in various village works. Because she worked actively, the masses supported her, and she was elected as a delegate to the county's peasant representative conference. But her mother-in-law still scolded her behind her back, calling her "crazy."

    XII. One day, Bao Tonghua came home late from a meeting and missed dinner, and her husband wanted to beat her again. Bao Tonghua thought, now that men and women are equal, and I have hands and feet to work, why should I be subjected to a man's anger! She simply separated from her husband.

    七、这一年家里种了二亩棉花。暴同花起早贪黑，从种花到收花，参加了许多主要劳动。她想冬季里给孩子换身新棉袄。可是，花摘回来，婆婆把好的拣去，剩下一斤多烂棉花给她。暴同花心里很难过。
    八、婆媳俩不能在一起过生活了，不得不分了家。暴同花想，俩口子过活该不会生气了吧。想不到丈夫待她还和从前一样。生活困难，吃不饱，穿不暖，丈夫张口骂她，闭口卖她，常常打她。暴同花哭得脸都焦黄了。
    九、夫妻间感情不好，谁也没有心劲好好生产，地里粪也不上，草长得跟玉茭一般高。
    十、一九四七年，鲁山解放了。村里来了一位女工作同志，时常召集村里的青年妇女开会。她说男女应该平等，妇女有权利参加各种社会工作。暴同花越听越对劲，觉得妇女有了出路。
    十一、她于是经常参加村里的各种工作。因为她工作积极，群众都拥护她，县里开农民代表大会时，她被选为大会的代表。但是她婆婆还在背后里骂她“疯障”。
    十二、有一天，暴同花开会回家晚了，耽误了晚饭，丈夫又要打她。暴同花想，现在男女平等，自己有手有脚能劳动，为啥还受男人的气！她干脆和丈夫分了家。
