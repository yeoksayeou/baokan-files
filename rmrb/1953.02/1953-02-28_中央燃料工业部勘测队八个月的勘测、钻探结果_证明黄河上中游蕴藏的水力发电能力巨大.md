The preliminary data needed for large-scale hydropower construction in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River were basically obtained in eight months, from May to December last year, by a strong surveying team composed of the Hydropower Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industries of the Central Government, together with relevant departments.

This surveying team was divided into surveying, mapping, and drilling teams. In the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, they initially conducted a hydropower resource survey of approximately 3,000 kilometers, mainly focusing on the Yellow River. They mapped the topography of reservoir dam sites and valleys covering approximately 5,500 square kilometers, initially drilled 3,500 meters of dam foundations, and investigated the economic geography of reservoirs covering approximately 7,600 square kilometers. Among them, detailed key surveys, mapping, and drilling were carried out at Sanmenxia, Qingshui River, and Longkou and Liujiaxia. In the upper reaches of the Yellow River, over a distance of 800 kilometers, they understood the topography and geological conditions of nineteen valleys and discovered many excellent reservoir dam sites. According to the results of existing surveys, it is estimated that the hydropower potential in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River is very large.

China has never before had such a large-scale survey and drilling operation for hydropower generation that would turn a harmful river into a beneficial one. These survey and drilling personnel completed their tasks while fighting against all kinds of dangers and difficulties. For example, in Sanmenxia, drilling was required on the Zhishi Stone, which is less than ten meters in diameter and located below the converging currents of Shenmen Island and Guimen Island. This Zhishi Stone was subjected to the impact of the rapids, and both sides were steep cliffs where it was impossible to stand. An old helmsman said, "No boat has ever dared to approach this Zhishi Stone." However, our survey team's boat approached the Zhishi Stone, and they also erected a steel cable suspension bridge over the gorge, installed the drilling rig on the Zhishi Stone, and completed the drilling task. In the dam foundation surveys and drilling at Longkou and Liujiaxia, many places required surveying and drilling in the water or in the middle of rapids. Therefore, sometimes a drilling rig was erected on a boat, and sometimes drilling was carried out during the river's freezing over, fighting against floods and ice floes. As for climbing mountains and crossing the precipices and cliffs that even shepherds had never reached to carry out work, it was the most common thing.

The surveying personnel not only overcame the difficulties of natural conditions, but also overcame the difficulties of lacking technical personnel. For example, the surveying work for the 2,000-square-kilometer Qingshui River Reservoir once had a surveying plan proposed in 1950 that required a surveying team of 250 engineers and technicians to complete within one year. However, they only had three technical personnel, twenty temporarily added surveying workers, and thirty-two novices who had no surveying skills at all. In their work, they gained experience through short-term training and typical experiments, and promoted a comprehensive method of learning and working at the same time, so that the staff mastered the technology and overfulfilled the task, ensuring quality.

    中央燃料工业部勘测队八个月的勘测、钻探结果
    证明黄河上中游蕴藏的水力发电能力巨大
    黄河上中游进行大规模水力发电建设所需要的初步资料，已经由中央人民政府燃料工业部水力发电工程局会同有关部门所组成的强大勘测队伍在去年五月到十二月的八个月中基本获得。
    这个勘测队伍，分勘察、测量和钻探队。他们在黄河上中游，初步进行了以黄河为主的水力资源勘察约三千公里，测量了水库坝址和峡谷的地形约五千五百平方公里，初步钻探了坝基三千五百公尺，调查了水库的经济地理约七千六百平方公里。其中，在三门峡、清水河和龙口、刘家峡三处，进行了详细的重点勘察、测量和钻探；在上游的八百公里内了解了十九个峡谷的地形、地质情况，发现许多优良的水库坝址。根据现有勘察的结果来看，估计黄河上中游蕴藏的水力发电能力是很大的。
    中国历史上从来没有过这样巨大规模的和变害河为利河的水力发电的勘察、钻探工作。这些勘测钻探人员，是在和种种艰险困难作斗争中完成任务的。如在三门峡，需要在神门岛和鬼门岛夹流下面方圆不足十公尺的砥柱石上进行钻探。这个砥柱石受着激流冲激，两面又是不能立足的峭壁，老舵工说：“从来没有过船敢靠近这砥柱石。”但是我们的勘探队的船却靠近了砥柱石，他们又在峡上拉起了钢丝吊索桥，钻探机也安到了砥柱石上，完成了钻探任务。在龙口和刘家峡的坝基勘察、钻探中，许多地方都需要在水中或在激流中间进行测量和钻探，所以有时就在船上架起钻探机，有时就趁冰冻封河时钻探，和洪水、浮冰作战。至于爬山越岭，走动在连牧羊人都没走到过的悬岩峭壁上去进行工作，更是最平常的事情。
    勘测人员们不只克服了自然条件的困难，还克服了缺乏技术人员的困难。如二千平方公里大面积的清水河水库的测量工作，在一九五○年曾经提出过一个测量计划，需要工程师和技术人员二百五十人的测量大队，在一年以内完成。但他们只有三个技术人员，二十个临时加入的测量工人，和三十二个完全没有测量技术的新手。他们在工作中通过短期训练和典型试验，取得经验，推广全面的边学边作的办法，使工作人员都掌握了技术，所以超额完成了任务，保证了质量。
