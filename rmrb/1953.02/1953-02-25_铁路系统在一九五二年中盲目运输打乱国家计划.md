    【Our Newspaper's Report】 Due to the leadership of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government failing to investigate and understand the sources and flow of goods, and failing to study the laws of national economic recovery and development, they blindly compiled an unrealistic transportation plan for 1952. This led most Railway Administrations, Transportation Sub-bureaus, and Stations to disregard transportation quality and the planned nature of national transportation. They simply pursued quantity, using all means to solicit freight and assemble trainloads, resulting in serious chaos in railway transportation.

    The railway transportation plan is part of the overall national economic plan. Therefore, the railway transportation plan must be based on the recovery and development of the entire national economy, and the resulting transportation needs. However, the Ministry of Railways failed to thoroughly study the possible situation of national economic development in 1952 and blindly formulated the 1952 transportation plan. For example, the freight ton-kilometer indicator in 1952 exceeded the planned indicator of 1951 by 38.3%, and exceeded the actual performance of 1951 by 22.1%; the converted ton-kilometer indicator also exceeded the 1951 indicator by 30%, and exceeded the actual performance of 1951 by 15%. Although there were different opinions within the leadership of the Ministry of Railways during the compilation of the 1952 plan, they ultimately approved the plan based on the narrow experience of "completing the plan in 1950 and 1951" and a blind, boastful enthusiasm. Under the influence of this leadership thinking, most Railway Administrations, Transportation Sub-bureaus, and Stations, in order to complete their tasks, developed a bias towards blindly soliciting freight and assembling trainloads, abandoning efforts to improve the planned nature of national transportation, resulting in a continuous decline in the planned nature of railway transportation. Planned transportation accounted for 73.5% of the total railway transportation volume in 1951, but dropped to 68.5% in 1952, and the transportation quality was poor, with many goods being transported unreasonably.

    This work of soliciting freight replaced national planned transportation with the capitalist method of "canvassing for business." Many units, as long as there was freight to transport, regardless of whether the transported goods had transportation value, whether the transportation route was reasonable, or whether it fell within their scope of business, would serve unconditionally. Originally, ordinary stones and sand were available everywhere, and according to the principle of using local materials, no construction unit needed to purchase and transport them from afar. However, many bureaus and stations, in order to assemble trainloads and complete their "tasks," disregarded the overall interests of the country and dispatched a large number of cadres to various places to promote the sale of stones and sand. The Hengyang Transportation Sub-bureau sent cadres to Nanchang to promote the sale of sand. The Qiansuo Station of the Jinzhou Transportation Sub-bureau went "three times to Qinhuangdao and twice to Tianjin" to find sales channels for river sand, and even stationed a special person in Tianjin. When a shipper complained about the poor quality of the sand, the Qiansuo Station immediately promised to sift the sand; when the shipper was unwilling to pay for sifting the sand, the Qiansuo Station immediately promised not to charge, and even mobilized employees to sift the sand as voluntary labor. The Tianjin Railway Administration, in order to assemble trainloads, signed an unreasonable transportation contract with the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, transporting coal to Xidaokou Station, where coal was not needed. The Wuchang Transportation Sub-bureau solicited a shipper who wanted to transport sweet potatoes, but the shipper did not have sacks to pack the sweet potatoes and could not transport them. The Wuchang Transportation Sub-bureau applied to the bank for a loan on behalf of the shipper, bought sacks, packed the sweet potatoes, and transported them out. The Wuyi Station of the Jinan Bureau heard that the local red soil could be used for casting, and rushed to send it to Shanghai and Pukou for testing. The Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other Transportation Sub-bureaus spared no effort to spend manpower and money, building roads and bridges, because the sources of goods they solicited were too far from the station. In addition to this, there were many other tricks in the solicitation work in various places. For example, as long as someone had goods, the railway would send someone to find customers for them; as long as someone wanted to buy something, the railway would find the supplier for them. This was called agency purchasing and sales. Some units simply produced goods themselves and then promoted them externally.

    These units not only neglected the completion of planned transportation when the source of goods was insufficient, focusing on soliciting business and assembling trainloads, but also, when the source of goods was sufficient, they sacrificed planned shipments of goods and important materials to accommodate the solicited freight. Employees often said: It was not easy to solicit the goods, if we don't let them go immediately, how can we find shippers next time? Conversely, from December 1st to 8th last year, the Tongjing Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing line of the Shanghai Transportation Sub-bureau needed 27 or 28 wagons per day according to the transportation plan, but the Shanghai Transportation Sub-bureau only allocated sufficient wagons on one day, and not on the other seven days. Jiashan is an important production area of bricks and tiles in East China. In order to prepare materials for capital construction in a timely manner, the East China Financial and Economic Committee instructed the Jiashan Station to allocate 35 wagons per day to load bricks and tiles to Shanghai, but the Jiashan Station did not act according to the instructions of the East China Financial and Economic Committee.

    Because this error of blind solicitation was not criticized in time, but was promoted as an advanced experience by many short-sighted localists, the error became more serious. The heads of the Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Jinzhou, Qiqihar and other Transportation Sub-bureaus personally led the solicitation work. The head of the Hengyang Transportation Sub-bureau listed vigorous sales promotion as the main key to completing the transportation task, and the freight stock of the bureau also listed sales promotion as the central task. Many bureaus and stations mobilized the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League to participate in the solicitation together. According to statistics, from January to December 20, 1952, the national railway system regularly had more than 15,700 employees forming 2,807 solicitation groups specializing in solicitation work. The family members of employees and temporarily mobilized employees for solicitation were not included in the statistics. One of the articles in the "Patriotic Pact" of the Finance Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration was "Each person guarantees to solicit one shipper per week."

    Because the railway departments unscrupulously solicited business, conflicts occurred with other transportation departments in terms of business. The Shanghai Railway Administration and the East China Maritime Administration once sued each other for grabbing business, and mutually reduced freight and handling fees and cargo grades. There were also internal conflicts within the railway department. For example, the timber transported from Jiangxi by waterway and transshipped to the north should have been handled by Pukou Station, but Nanjing Station抢着运了. The Tongyuanpu Station of the Andong Sub-bureau went to villages 80 miles away from the station to solicit tobacco leaves that were originally planned to be shipped from Haicheng Station. Conflicts also occurred frequently between Hankou and Wuchang stations. The Shanghai and Jinan bureaus had disputes over solicitation, and requested the Ministry of Railways to delineate the scope of solicitation. Many places with more freight sources concentrated cadres from railway departments from various places, vying to undertake transportation. Most shippers reflected: Don't even mention the consignment plan anymore. If you submit a plan, the goods will be allocated late and you will be fined. It is better to wait for solicitation, which is as convenient as it can be.

    This solicitation work of the railway department violated the national transportation policy. In order to complete the unrealistic transportation plan, the leading cadres of the Ministry of Railways adopted an attitude of rewarding and promoting solicitation work. Although they also shouted that transportation quality could not be ignored, they only remained at the level of general appeals. The cadres below lacked an overall concept, only saw the need to complete the task of loading wagons, and did not consider the losses that would be caused to the entire country and the railway transportation enterprise by completing the task by unscrupulous means. Secondly, they did not clearly distinguish the essential difference between organizing the source of goods and this kind of blind solicitation. In addition, with the support of the leadership, they promoted this capitalist "canvassing for business" method as an advanced experience, and even formed a mass movement in a relatively wide range, eventually leading to a major mistake.

    In addition to this, when implementing the 1952 transportation plan, the railway department emphasized quantity over quality, only focusing on completing the task and disregarding economic accounting. For example, the Dalian North Station could load 16 tons of vermicelli per wagon, but only loaded 10 tons. The Dalian Port Station once transported six tons of reed mats in two wagons (each wagon can generally load 17 tons of reed mats). The record of loading hemp at the Dawenkou Station of the Jinan Transportation Sub-bureau once reached 18.744 tons per wagon, but in order to complete the number of wagons loaded, the stationmaster Ren Jizhong stipulated that each wagon should be limited to 12 tons. From October 1st to November 15th last year, the Zhengzhou Transportation Sub-bureau reloaded a total of 557 times due to poor cargo loading, increasing the operation time. In order to increase the number of wagons loaded by their unit and improve the net weight per wagon, the full-wagon less-than-carload goods from Dezhou to Shanghai were unnecessarily increased in the number of transfers en route. In this way, a batch of goods was transferred several times before arriving at the station, increasing loading and unloading costs, increasing operating time, extending the transportation time of goods en route, and causing waste in the use of wagons. In 1952, the transfer fee of the Jinan Railway Administration exceeded the plan by 600 million yuan. In 1952, the national railway's one-time cargo operation stop time only reached 89.5% of the plan, and the transfer stop time per wagon only reached 94.3% of the plan.

    Based on the above situation, the Ministry of Railways has now announced that all solicitation work will be immediately abolished throughout the railway, and correct organization of the source of goods will be strengthened, the source and flow of goods will be investigated, a flow chart will be formulated, in order to implement the policy of planned transportation, and it is determined that the two links of reducing costs and improving quality should be grasped in the work in 1953.

    铁路系统在一九五二年中盲目运输打乱国家计划
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部领导方面由于不调查了解货源、货流情况，不研究国家经济恢复和发展的规律，盲目编制脱离实际的一九五二年运输计划，以致大部分管理局、运输分局与车站不顾运输的质量和国家的运输计划性，单纯追求数量，不择手段地招揽货源，凑装车数，造成铁路运输中严重的混乱现象。
    铁路运输计划是整个国民经济计划的一部分，因此，铁路运输计划必须根据整个国民经济的恢复和发展，以及随之而来的运输需要来编制。但是铁道部未切实研究一九五二年国家经济发展的可能情况，盲目制订了一九五二年的运输计划。如一九五二年货运计费吨公里指标较一九五一年的计划指标超过百分之三十八点三，较一九五一年实绩超过百分之二十二点一；换算吨公里指标也较一九五一年指标超过百分之三十，较一九五一年实绩超过百分之十五。铁道部领导方面在编制一九五二年计划时虽然也曾有过不同意见，但最后都根据“一九五零年、一九五一年都完成计划”的狭隘经验，加上好大喜功的盲目积极性，通过了这个计划。在这种领导思想的影响下，大部分管理局、运输分局和车站为了完成任务，便产生了盲目招揽货源，凑装车数的偏向，放弃了对提高国家运输计划性的努力，以致铁路运输的计划性每况愈下。一九五一年计划运输占铁路总运输量的百分之七十三点五，一九五二年即降为百分之六十八点五，而且运输质量低劣，许多货物的运输是不合理的。
    这种招揽货源的工作，是以资本主义“兜生意”的经营方式代替国家的计划运输。许多单位只要有货运，不管所运货物有无运输价值，不管运输线路是否合理，不管是否属于自己的业务范围，一概无条件地效劳。本来一般的石头和沙子各地都有，按照就地取材的方针，任何建筑单位都不需要从远地购运。但许多局和车站为了凑装车数，完成自己的
    “任务”，却不顾国家的整体利益，派遣大批干部到各地推销石头和沙子。衡阳运输分局派了干部到南昌去推销沙子。锦州运输分局前所站为了给河沙找销路曾“三下秦皇岛，两去天津”，甚至还派专人驻在天津。一位货主嫌沙子质量不好，前所站连忙答应把沙子筛一遍；货主不愿付筛沙子的费用，前所站连忙答应不要钱，竟发动职工义务劳动筛沙子。天津铁路管理局为了凑装车数，和中国煤业建筑器材公司订立不合理的运输合同，把煤运到不用煤的西道口站。武昌运输分局招揽到一个运红薯的货主，但货主没有麻袋装红薯，运不走，武昌运输分局就代货主向银行申请贷款，买了麻袋装上红薯向外运。济南局五义站听说当地红土可供翻砂之用，忙送到上海、浦口去化验。徐州、郑州等运输分局因招揽的货源距车站太远，不惜劳民伤财，铺路搭桥。除此以外，各地在招揽工作中还有许多名目众多的花样。如：只要某人有货，铁路方面就派人替他找主顾；只要某人想买什么，铁路方面就替他找货主。这叫做代购代销。有的单位索性自己生产再向外推销。
    这些单位不仅在货源不足时，为凑装车数，忙于招揽，放松了计划运输的完成；而且货源充足时，也为了照顾招揽的货源，不惜将按计划托运的货物与重要物资积压下来。职工们常说：好容易把货物招来了，不让它马上走，下回怎样去找货主。相反的，上海运输分局沪宁线铜井车站在去年十二月一日至八日中，按运输计划，每天需二十七、八辆车，但上海运输分局除有一天配足车辆外，其余七天都没有配车。嘉善是华东砖瓦的重要产地，华东财政经济委员会为及时作好基本建设的材料准备工作，曾指令嘉善车站每天拨三十五辆车装砖瓦到上海，但嘉善车站未按华东财政经济委员会指示办事。
    由于这种盲目招揽的错误未受到及时批判，反被许多鼠目寸光的本位主义者当作先进经验推广，错误便发展得更加严重。上海、郑州、济南、锦州、齐齐哈尔等运输分局的局长都亲自领导招揽工作。衡阳运输分局的局长把大力推销列为完成运输任务的主要关键，该局货运股也把推销列为中心工作。许多局、站都是党、行政、工会、青年团一齐动员参加招揽。据统计，全国铁路系统一九五二年一月到十二月二十日，经常有一万五千七百余职工组成二千八百零七个招揽小组专门做招揽工作，至于职工家属及临时突击招揽的职工尚未统计在内。上海铁路管理局财务处的“爱国公约”上就有一条是“每人每周保证招揽一个货主”。
    铁道部门由于不择手段地招揽生意，便和其他运输部门在业务方面发生冲突。上海铁路管理局和华东区海运管理局就曾因抢生意而互相控告，并互相降低运杂费及货物等级。铁道部门内部也互相冲突，如由江西水路运来的木材转运北方，应由浦口站接运，但南京站却抢着运了。安东分局通远堡站到离站八十里处的乡村去招揽原计划在海城站托运的烟叶。汉口和武昌站也不断发生冲突。上海和济南两局招揽上发生争执，要求铁道部划分招揽范围。许多货源较多的地方集中了来自各地铁道部门的干部，争着承运。一般货主都反映：再也不提托运计划了，提了计划，拨货迟了，得罚款，倒不如等着招揽，要多方便有多方便。
    铁道部门这种招揽工作违背了国家运输方针。铁道部领导干部为了完成脱离实际的运输计划，对招揽工作采取奖励提倡的态度，他们虽然也叫喊过不能忽视运输质量，但也只停留在一般号召上。下面的干部一来缺乏整体观念，只看到要完成装车任务，不考虑不择手段地完成任务将给整个国家和铁路运输企业造成损失，二来划不清组织货源和这种盲目招揽之间的本质区别，再加上领导方面支持，便把这种资本主义“兜生意”的方式当作先进经验推广，甚至在相当广泛的范围内形成群众性的运动，终致酿成大错。
    除此以外，铁道部门在执行一九五二年运输计划时，重量不重质，只顾完成任务，不顾经济核算。如大连北站装粉条每车可装十六吨，但只肯装十吨。大连港站有一次竟将六吨芦席分装在两个车厢里运走（每车一般可装芦席十七吨）。济南运输分局大汶口站装麻的纪录曾达到每车十八点七四四吨，但为完成装车数，站长任纪锺竟规定每车限装十二吨。郑州运输分局去年十月一日到十一月十五日间，因货物装载不良，共整装五百五十七次，增加了作业时间。有的为增加本单位的装车数字及提高每辆车的净载重，竟把德州发到上海去的整车零担货物，在途中无故增加中转次数。这样，一批货物中转了几次才到站，增大了装卸费用，增加了作业时间，延长了货物途中运输时间，更造成车辆使用上的浪费。一九五二年济南铁路管理局的中转费就较计划超过了六亿元。全国铁路一九五二年一次货物作业停留时间只达到计划的百分之八十九点五，每车中转停留时间只达到计划的百分之九十四点三。
    根据以上情况，铁道部现已宣布全路立即废止招揽工作，加强正确的组织货源工作，调查货源、货流，制定货流图，以贯彻计划运输的方针，并确定在一九五三年工作中要抓住降低成本和提高质量两个环节。
