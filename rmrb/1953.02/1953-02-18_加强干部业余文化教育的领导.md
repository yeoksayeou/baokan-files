Strengthening Leadership in Cadre's After-Work Cultural Education

One of the heavy burdens left to the Chinese people by reactionary rule is the lack of universal education. The vast majority of workers and peasants were deprived of the right to education in the old society, and most of them are still illiterate. A large number of revolutionary cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds also did not have sufficient opportunities to improve their education due to years of intense revolutionary struggle. Although many of them have learned to read, their educational level is still low.

The current state of cadres' educational levels can be exemplified by statistics from the Northwest region. In the entire Northwest region, more than 40,000 cadres have an educational level at or below primary school, including more than 2,000 at the district level. The educational level of cadres in other regions is likely not much different from that in the Northwest region. This situation hinders the improvement of cadres' work ability and political level and is therefore incompatible with the objective situation of our country's construction. Especially today, when large-scale, planned national construction has begun, the country needs a large number of cadres who are not only politically strong but also have a high level of education, requiring these cadres to possess the complete knowledge, including scientific and technological knowledge, needed to engage in construction. The actual situation tells us that many cadres with lower levels of education, especially many worker and peasant cadres who have been in struggle for a long time without the opportunity to improve their education, generally have the distress of being unable to cope with new work tasks. For the vast majority of these cadres, they are unwilling to fall behind, they want to catch up with the requirements of the times, they hope that their work will have the best results, and they strive to develop themselves politically and culturally to become talents capable of undertaking complex construction tasks. Therefore, while strengthening cadres' political education, strengthening their cultural education and improving their educational level has become an important issue in the current cadre policy. If this issue is not resolved, these cadres will not be able to meet the needs of their work, and their enthusiasm and motivation will be affected by their inability to take on new tasks, which will inevitably bring huge losses to the country's construction.

Thanks to the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the work of cultural education for cadres in Party and government organs at all levels has achieved great success. In addition to a large number of worker and peasant cadres being transferred to worker-peasant rapid middle schools and worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools, cadres' after-work cultural schools (also known as机关文化补习学校) have also been widely developed. However, in order to smoothly carry out large-scale national construction, further strengthen the Party's leadership in cadres' cultural education, further improve the current situation of cadres' cultural education, and solve some of the difficulties and problems existing in the work, is absolutely necessary.

Among the large number of cadres who need cultural supplementary education, we should first focus on rapidly raising the cultural level of cadres at or above the district level (or equivalent) to the level of junior high school graduation. This is because these cadres are already bearing the leadership responsibility of grassroots organizations, and it is they who have an extremely important relationship to whether policies can be implemented, whether work can be done well, especially to the quality of work of grassroots organizations and grassroots governments. In order to solve this problem, the leading bodies of various regions must make up their minds, formulate training plans, and transfer these cadres to Party schools (cultural classes) or other cadre schools in stages within two years to study culture. The instructions of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on improving the cultural level of worker and peasant cadres at or above the district level, published in this newspaper today (see page 3), provide a good example. The Northwest Bureau decided to transfer more than 2,000 district-level cadres in the region whose cultural level only reached the primary school level in stages for training, striving to raise them to the junior high school graduation level within two years. The first phase of training will transfer 800 people to study at the Northwest Party School, Northwest People's Revolutionary University, Party Schools of various provinces, and cadre schools, and stipulate that cultural courses should account for three-quarters of the course weight. This measure is completely correct and necessary. Experience has proved that although these leading cadres can also work and study culture at the same time, they often face many difficulties in learning due to heavy tasks and busy work. In particular, because the cultural learning of on-the-job cadres mostly adopts the method of cadres' after-work cultural schools, these leading cadres often miss classes due to work delays and cannot keep up with the progress. Therefore, only by transferring them to schools can we truly ensure that their cultural learning achieves real results. Although this has a temporary hindrance to current work, it is absolutely necessary from a long-term perspective. The Central Bureaus should refer to the practices of the Northwest Bureau, investigate the number of cadres at or above the district level below the junior high school graduation level in the entire region, and propose a phased training plan. The solution to this problem should not be delayed any further.

As for cadres below the district level who need to improve their cultural level, since the number is large, it is impossible for them to all leave their jobs to study. For them, working and studying at the same time is still the most important method. Recent experience has proved that on-the-job cadre cultural education is best carried out in the form of cadres' after-work cultural schools. Because these schools have dedicated personnel in charge, full-time and part-time teachers who teach classes on time, and regular systems such as handing in homework and tests, attendance, class assignments, and promotions, the teaching effect is greatly improved, overcoming the lax and unregulated phenomena that easily breed in the study of on-the-job cadres. The reports on cadres' after-work cultural schools in the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee, Tangshan City, and other regions published in this newspaper today (all on page 3) fully illustrate the advantages of these schools and provide many valuable experiences. In order to take care of the cultural learning of cadres in county and district organs so that it is not interrupted due to going to the countryside, the experience of establishing cadre cultural learning stations in the eight suburban districts of Tangshan City is also worth learning.

At present, in many regions, cadres' after-work cultural schools have been widely established and have become one of the important levers for improving the cultural level of cadres. Some cadres' after-work cultural schools are run well due to the attention and help of the leadership. However, there are also many cadres' after-work cultural schools that still have many difficulties due to insufficient attention and help from the leadership. In order to make the cadres' after-work cultural schools in various places run well and play a greater role, the following issues should be resolved: First, the current phenomenon of no one being responsible in leadership should be overcome. The administrative leaders of each unit should have dedicated personnel responsible for the leadership of cadres' after-work cultural schools, and the propaganda committee members of the Party's grassroots organizations should, in addition to being responsible for managing cadres' political and theoretical education, also take on the responsibility of managing cultural education. The cultural and educational departments of local governments should designate certain departments to manage this work and provide business guidance (some regions have already done so). The propaganda departments of local Party committees should also have someone to study and guide the business of this work. Only when the Party committee and relevant administrative departments are jointly responsible and cooperate with each other can this work be done well. Second, full-time teachers should be appropriately equipped in terms of teachers. Because part-time teachers find it difficult to do well in preparing lessons, correcting homework, and making up lessons (some cadres are prone to delaying learning due to work mobility, so the make-up lesson system is necessary), it is necessary to equip them with sufficient full-time teachers. The political and material treatment of teachers in cadres' after-work cultural schools should be the same as that of general schools, and should not be too low. Appropriate education and persuasion should be carried out for the students to correct the phenomena of excessive demands on teachers and some disrespect for teachers. Third, in terms of funding, necessary guarantees should be given for carrying out the work. The difficulties of necessary housing should be resolved. Finally, some organs should also seriously ensure the learning time of students and try not to arrange work during the stipulated cultural learning time. The leaders of these organs should also seriously take on the responsibility of supervising and inspecting cadres' cultural learning and help solve various difficulties for students in learning.

Of course, there are many other problems in the work of cadres' after-work cultural schools. For example, there is a shortage of teachers and the quality of teaching is not high; for example, there is still a lack of middle school textbooks suitable for use by机关干部; and there are also questions such as how to improve cadres who have completed junior high school courses and establish senior high school classes, which all remain to be studied. The propaganda and education departments of local Party committees should study these issues in a timely manner and summarize the experience of cadres' after-work cultural schools in a timely manner. In 1953, we should strive to establish the cause of after-work cultural education for on-the-job cadres on a national scale and on an overall scale, and we must run it well. We must strive to systematically raise all cadres with a cultural level below middle school to the level of junior high school graduation in not too long a time. Comrade Stalin taught us that "of all the valuable things in the world, the most valuable and most useful is people - cadres," "We should diligently and carefully cultivate people, like a gardener cultivating a beloved fruit tree." Now, the vast number of cadres urgently need to improve their cultural level, and we must show in this regard that we value cadres and have a diligent and careful attitude like a gardener in cultivating cadres.

### 加强干部业余文化教育的领导

    加强干部业余文化教育的领导
    反动统治遗留给中国人民的沉重负担之一，就是教育不普及。广大工农群众在旧社会被剥夺了受教育的权利，大多数人至今还是不识字的文盲。数量众多的出身工农的革命干部也因多年参加激烈的革命斗争没有充分机会提高文化，许多人虽识了字，文化程度仍然很低。
    当前干部文化水平的情况可以用西北区的统计来做一个例证。西北全区干部文化程度在初小以下的即有四万余名，其中区级干部占两千余名。其它地区干部文化水平的情况，和西北区相差也不会很远。这种情况妨碍了干部的工作能力和政治水平的提高，因而是和我们国家建设事业发展的客观形势不相称的。特别是到了今天，大规模的有计划的国家建设已经开始，国家需要大量不但政治锻炼强而且文化水平高的干部，要求这些干部具备从事建设事业所需要的完备的知识，包括科学和技术的知识。而实际情况告诉我们，许多文化程度较低的干部，特别是许多经过较长期斗争而无机会提高文化的工农干部，在新的工作任务面前，普遍有不能胜任的苦恼。就这些干部的绝大多数来说，他们是不甘心落后的，他们愿意赶上时代的要求，希望自己的工作收到最好的效果，并努力要使自己在政治上和文化上有发展而成为能够担任复杂的建设任务的人材。因此，在加强干部的政治教育的同时，加强干部的文化教育，提高干部的文化程度，就成为当前干部政策上的重要课题。这个课题不解决，这些干部就不能应付工作的需要，并由于不能胜任新的工作而影响他们的积极性和上进心，其结果必将给国家建设事业带来巨大的损失。
    由于党中央和毛主席的关怀，各级党政机关中的干部文化教育工作已获得很大成绩。除了有不少工农干部被抽调到工农速成中学、工农文化补习学校学习以外，干部业余文化学校（也有称做机关文化补习学校的）也得到广泛的发展。但是，为了顺利进行大规模的国家建设，进一步加强党对干部文化教育工作的领导，进一步改善当前干部文化教育工作的状况，并解决工作中存在的若干困难问题，就是完全必要的了。
    在数量众多的需要补习文化的干部中间，首先应该着重把区级或相当于区级以上的干部文化水平，迅速地提高到初中毕业的程度。这是因为这些干部已经负担着基层组织的领导责任，正是他们，对于政策的能否贯彻，工作的能否做好，特别是对基层组织与基层政权工作的好坏，有着极重要的关系。为了解决这一问题，各地区领导方面必须下定决心，制订调训的计划，在两年之内分期把这些干部调到党校（文化班）或其它干部学校中学习文化。今天本报发表的中共中央西北局关于提高区级以上工农干部文化水平的指示（见第三版），提供了一个良好的范例。西北局决定把全区两千余名文化水平只达到初小水平的区级干部，分期调训，争取在两年内把他们提高到初中毕业程度。第一期调训八百名，分别在西北党校、西北人民革命大学、各省党校、干部学校学习，并规定文化课在课程比重上应占四分之三。这一措施是完全正确的，必要的。经验证明，这些领导干部虽也可以一面工作，一面学习文化，但往往因为任务重，工作忙，学习的困难很多。特别是由于在职干部文化学习多已采用干部业余文化学校的方式，这些领导干部常常因为工作耽误，缺席多，赶不上进度。所以，只有把他们调到学校中去，才能真正保证他们的文化学习获得确实的成效。这对当前工作虽有暂时的妨碍，但从长远的利益着眼，却是完全必要的。各中央局应该参照西北局的作法，调查全区在初中毕业程度以下的区级以上干部的人数，并提出分期调训的计划。这一问题的解决不应该再延缓了。
    至于需要提高文化水平的区级以下的干部，由于人数众多，不可能都离职学习，对于他们，一面工作一面学习仍是最主要的方式。近年的经验证明，在职干部文化教育，最好以干部业余文化学校的方式进行。由于这种学校有专人负责，有专任教员和兼任教员按时上课，有交作业和测验、考勤、编班、升级等正规制度，就使得教学效果大为提高，克服了在职干部学习中容易滋生的散漫自流现象。今天本报刊载的中共中央直属机关、唐山市和其它地区的干部业余文化学校的报道（都见第三版），充分说明了这种学校的优点，并提供了许多可重视的经验。为了照顾县区机关干部的文化学习不致因为下乡而中断，唐山市郊八区建立干部文化学习站的经验，也是值得学习的。
    目前许多地区中，干部业余文化学校已比较普遍地建立起来并已成为提高干部文化水平的重要的杠杆之一了。有些干部业余文化学校由于领导方面的重视和帮助，办得较好。但也有很多干部业余文化学校，由于领导方面的重视不够和帮助不够，还存在着许多困难。为了使各地干部业余文化学校办好并起更大的作用，应该解决以下这些问题：第一，在领导问题上应克服目前某些无人负责现象。各单位的行政领导方面应有专人负起干部业余文化学校的领导责任，党的基层组织的宣传委员除应负责管理干部政治、理论教育工作外，应对文化教育也负起管理的责任。各地政府文教部门应指定一定部门管理这
    一工作并进行业务指导（有些地区已经这样做了）。各地党委宣传部门也应有人研究与指导这一工作的业务。只有党委与行政有关部门共同负责并互相配合，才能把这一工作做好。第二，教员问题上应适当配备专职教员。因为兼职教员对备课、改作业、补课（有些干部易因工作流动而耽误学习，所以补课制是必要的）等都较难做好，所以必须配备足够的专职教员。对干部业余文化学校的教员的政治、物质待遇，应该和一般学校一致，不应偏低。应该对学员进行适当的教育说服，纠正对教员要求过高和某些不尊重教员的现象。第三，在经费问题上，应给以进行工作必要的保证。应该解决必要的房屋的困难。最后，有些机关还应认真保证学员的学习时间，在规定的文化学习时间内尽量不要布置工作。这些机关的领导人员并应认真负起督促和检查干部文化学习的责任，帮助解决学员在学习上的各种困难。
    自然，干部业余文化学校工作中还有其它许多问题，例如，教员缺少而且教学质量不高；又如现在还缺少适合机关干部使用的中学教科书；还有已经学完初中课程的干部如何提高与建立高级中学班次这些问题，都尚待研究。各地党委宣教部门应该适时地研究这些问题，并适时地总结干部业余文化学校的经验。在一九五三年，我们应该做到在全国范围内和在全体规模上把在职干部的业余文化教育事业办起来，并要把它办好。我们要努力争取在不要很长的时间内，把全体文化水平在中学以下的干部，有系统地提高到初中毕业的水平上来。斯大林同志教导我们说：“世界上所有的一切有价值的东西，其中最有价值的并且最有用的，是人——干部”，
    “我们应该殷勤地和细心地培植人，像园丁培植一棵心爱的果树一样。”现在，广大干部迫切需要提高文化水平，我们正是要在这方面显示出重视干部并在培养干部上有像园丁一样殷勤和细心的态度。
