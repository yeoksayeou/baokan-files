(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th) From February 11th to 16th, the ground battles on the Korean front mostly occurred at night. During the day, enemy and our artillery exchanged fire.

During these six days, the enemy decreased their activities outside during the day or night compared to before, especially during the day. In these six days, the Korean-Chinese People's Forces conducted many successful raids, wiping out most of two platoons of the defending US Army and all of five platoons (including three reinforced platoons) and three squads of the ROK army, totaling more than 420 enemy soldiers.

On the night of the 14th, our troops on the western front, with artillery support, raided an enemy position near Yujishanli, northwest of Lianchuan. Defending this position was an infantry platoon and a weapons platoon of the US 7th Division, with twelve tunnel-style shelters. When our raiding party was discovered by the enemy 40 meters from the enemy, they bravely charged up the main peak, and then engaged in a cave-by-cave battle, wiping out most of the enemies who retreated to the tunnel shelters. This battle resulted in the elimination of 57 enemies.

On the night of the 16th, our troops on the central front raided a position of a reinforced platoon of the ROK 9th Division south of Shangganling on the right side of the ridge north of Jinhua, wiping out all 58 defending enemies in twelve minutes of fierce fighting.

Our troops on the eastern front launched five raids against the enemy in three days, eliminating more than 300 enemy soldiers.

In these raids, our soldiers fully demonstrated their invincible fighting spirit. Despite the enemy's painstaking efforts to strengthen fortifications and build semi-underground tunnels connected to the shelters, they could not protect their soldiers from being wiped out.

In the battle to raid a position of the ROK 3rd Division south of Yuyunli, southeast of Jincheon, another hero in the style of Huang Jiguang, Zhao Yiwan, emerged. When our raiding party was blocked by enemy fire upon approaching the enemy, Zhao Yiwan unhesitatingly pounced on the enemy heavy machine gun firing point that was blocking our army's advance, using his body to block the gun muzzle, enabling the raiding party to successfully break into the enemy's position and wipe out the entire defending platoon.

In addition, our troops also eliminated nearly 200 enemy soldiers in ambush and blocking battles.

During these six days, our frontline mobile artillery killed or wounded a total of 461 enemy soldiers; frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down 14 enemy planes and damaged 15 enemy planes.

    朝中人民部队进行多次成功的袭击战
    前线高射炮火在六天中击落击伤敌机二十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】二月十一日到十六日，朝鲜前线的地面战斗大多发生在夜间。在白天，敌我双方炮火进行对射。
    在这六天中，敌人在白天或者在黑夜出外活动的次数比以前减少了，尤其在白天活动的更少。朝中人民部队在这六天中进行了许多次成功的袭击战，歼灭守敌美军两个排大部和李伪军五个排（内有三个加强排）三个班全部，计四百二十多名。
    十四日深夜，西线我军在炮火配合下袭击涟川西北鱼积山里附近的一个敌军阵地。守在这个阵地上的是美军第七师的一个步兵排和一个火器排，那里有十二个坑道式的掩蔽部。当我军袭击队进到距敌四十公尺处被敌发觉时，立即奋勇地冲上主峰，以后又展开逐洞争夺的战斗，将退守坑道掩蔽部的敌人大部歼灭。此次战斗计歼敌五十七名。
    中线我军在十六日深夜袭击金化以北上甘岭右边山岭以南李伪军第九师的一个加强排的阵地，激战十二分钟即将守敌五十八名全部歼灭。
    东线我军在三天之内向敌人进行了五次袭击，歼灭敌人三百多名。
    在这些袭击战斗中，我军战士们充分表现了攻无不胜的战斗精神。尽管敌人煞费苦心加修工事，并修筑了与掩蔽部相连的半截坑道，也无法庇护它的士兵不被歼灭。
    在袭击金城东南渔云里以南李伪军第三师一个阵地的战斗中，我军又出现了一位黄继光式的英雄赵一万。当我军袭击队接敌时为敌人火力所阻，赵一万便毫不犹豫地向阻挡我军前进的敌人重机枪火力点扑过去，用自己的身体堵塞住枪眼，使袭击队顺利地突入了敌人阵地，全歼守敌一个排。
    此外我军还在伏击、阻击等战斗中，歼灭敌人近二百名。
    这六天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军四百六十一名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机十四架，击伤敌机十五架。
